بَعَضَهُ البَعُوضُ, [aor.<br>\
بَعَضَ,] inf. n. بَعْضٌ, The<br>\
بَعُوض [or gnats, or musquitoes,] bit him; and<br>\
annoyed, or molested, him. (TA.) And بُعِضُوا<br>\
They were bitten by the بَعُوض: (A:) or were<br>\
annoyed, or molested, thereby. (K.) بَعَضَهُ is not<br>\
used in relation to anything but بَعُوض. (TA.)<br>\
A poet says, praising a man who passed the night<br>\
within a كِلَّة [or thin curtain used for protection<br>\
from gnats, or musquitoes], which is also called<br>\
أَبُو دِثَارٍ,<br>\
لَنِعْمَ البَيْتُ بَيْتُ أَبِى دِثَارٍ<br>\
إِذَا مَا خَافَ بَعْضُ القَوْمِ بَعْضَا<br>\
[Excellent indeed is the tent, the tent of Aboo-Dithár, when some of the people fear biting, and<br>\
annoyance, or molestation, from gnats, or musquitoes]: by بعضا meaning عَضًّا. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
بعضهُ, inf. n. تَبْعِيضٌ, He divided it into<br>\
parts, or portions, (S, A, Msb, K,) distinct, or<br>\
separate, one from another. (Msb) You say,<br>\
أَخَذُوا مَالَهُ فَبَعَّضُوهُ They took his property and<br>\
divided it into parts, or portions. (A, TA.)<br>\
And عَضَّى الشَّاةَ وَ بَعَّضَهَا [He limbed, or dismembered, the sheep, or goat, and divided it into<br>\
parts, or portions]. (A, TA.) [Hence,] مِنْ in<br>\
certain cases, and بِ in the like cases, as in the<br>\
saying شَرِبْتُ بِمَآءِ كَذَا [“ I drank of,” i. e. “ some<br>\
of, such water ”], are said to be لِلتَّبْعِيضِ [For the<br>\
purpose of dividing into parts, or portions].<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
4<br>\
ابعضوا They had بَعُوض [or gnats, or musquitoes], (K,) or abundance thereof, (A,) in their<br>\
land. (A, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تبعّض It was, or became, divided into parts,<br>\
or portions. (S, K.)<br>\
بَعْضٌ Some, or somewhat or some one, (lit. a<br>\
thing,) of things, or of a thing: Th says that it<br>\
signifies thus accord. to all the grammarians;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) except Hishám, as will be seen hereafter: (TA:) or a part, or portion, (A, Msb,<br>\
K,) of a thing, (Msb,) or of anything; (A, K;)<br>\
whether little or much: (TA:) accord. to both<br>\
these explanations, it may denote the greater part;<br>\
as eight of ten: (Msb:) [thus it signifies some<br>\
one or more; and it relates to persons and to<br>\
other things:] pl. أَبْعَاضٌ; (S, IJ, K;) but ISd<br>\
doubts whether IJ had an authority for this.<br>\
(TA.) You say, بَعْضُ الشَّرِّ أَهْوَنُ مِنْ بَعْضٍ [Some<br>\
kinds of evil are easier to be borne than some].<br>\
(A.) And جَارِيَةٌ حُسَّانَةٌ يُشْبِهُ بَعْضُهَا بَعْضًا [A very<br>\
beautiful girl, parts of whom resemble other parts].<br>\
(A.) [And ضَرَبَ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا Some of them beat<br>\
some; i. e. they beat one another.] And لَبِثْنَا يَوْمًا<br>\
أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ [We have tarried a day or part of<br>\
a day]. (Kur xviii. 18.) And one says to a man<br>\
of a company of men, “Who did this? ” and he<br>\
answers, أَحَدُنَا or بَعْضُنَا [Some one of us]; meaning himself. (A.) The article ال should not be<br>\
prefixed to it, (K, * TA,) because it is originally a<br>\
prefixed n., and as such determinate either literally or virtually, so that it does not admit another<br>\
cause of being determinate; (TA;) contr. to what<br>\
is said by IDrst (K, TA) and Ez-Zejjájee; for<br>\
they said البَعْضُ and الكُلُّ; which, properly, as<br>\
ISd says, is not allowable; and it is said in the<br>\
O that IDrst, in this matter, was at variance with<br>\
all the people of his age: (TA:) AHát says that<br>\
the Arabs did not say الكُلُّ nor البَعْضُ, but that<br>\
people used these expressions, even Sb and Akh<br>\
in their two books, by reason of their little knowledge in this way: (K, * TA:) a remark, says MF,<br>\
which is extr., and needs no comment: (TA:)<br>\
[for who surpassed Sb and Akh in knowledge<br>\
respecting matters of this kind?] AHát also relates<br>\
his having told As that he had seen in the book<br>\
of [that celebrated and chaste author] Ibn-ElMukaffa&#39;, العِلْمُ الكَثِيرٌ وَ لٰكِنَّ أَخْذَ البَعْضِ خَيْرٌ مِنْ<br>\
تَرْكِ الكُلِّ [Science is large; but the acquiring of<br>\
part is better than the neglecting of the whole];<br>\
and that As disapproved of it most strongly,<br>\
saying that the article ال is not prefixed to بَعْضٌ<br>\
and كُلٌّ because they are determinate without it:<br>\
(TA:) Az, however, says that the grammarians<br>\
allow its being prefixed to these two words,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) though As disallows it, (TA,) because they are meant to be understood as prefixed<br>\
ns.; (Msb;) or because the article is meant to<br>\
be a substitute for the noun to which they should<br>\
be prefixed; or, in the case of بَعْضٌ, because this<br>\
word is equivalent to جُزْءٌ, which receives the<br>\
article ال. (MF.) It is related of AO, that he<br>\
assigned also to بَعْضٌ the contr. meaning of All;<br>\
or the whole: adducing as a proof thereof the<br>\
words of the Kur [xl. 29], يُصِبْكُمْ بَعْضُ الَّذِى<br>\
يَعِدُكُمْ as meaning All of that with which he<br>\
threateneth you will befall you: and the saying<br>\
of Lebeed.<br>\
أَوْ يَعْتَلِقْ بَعْضَ النُّفُوسِ حِمَامُهَا<br>\
[as meaning Or their death shall cling to all<br>\
living creatures: or, accord. to another relation,<br>\
او يَرْتَبِطْ, which means the same as او يعتلق]:<br>\
thus also AHeyth explains the above-cited verse<br>\
of the Kur; and thus Hishám explains the saying<br>\
of Lebeed, erroneously asserting that بعض is here<br>\
a pl.: (TA:) but with respect to the former<br>\
instance, the Prophet had threatened them with<br>\
two things, the punishment of the present world<br>\
and that of the world to come; so he says, “This<br>\
punishment will befall you in the present world; ”<br>\
which is part (بعض] of the two threats; without<br>\
denying the punishment of the world to come:<br>\
or, as Aboo-Is-hák says, he mentions the part to<br>\
indicate the necessary consequence of the whole:<br>\
and as to the saying of Lebeed, by بعض النفوس<br>\
he means himself. (TA [app. from ISd].)<br>\
أَرْضٌ بَعِضَةٌ A land abounding with بَعُوض [or<br>\
gnats, or musquitoes]; (K;) as also ↓ مَبْعَضَةٌ,<br>\
like as you say مَبَقَّةٌ. (TA.) And لَيْلَةٌ بَعِضَةٌ A<br>\
night in which are many بَعُوض; as also ↓ مَبْعُوضَةٌ<br>\
(A, K.)<br>\
بَعُوضٌ [Gnats, or musquitoes;] i. q. بَقَّ [which<br>\
signifies both gnats, or musquitoes, (called in<br>\
Egypt نَامُوس,) and also bugs]: n. un. with ة:<br>\
(S:) or pl. of بَعُوضَةٌ, (K,) which signifies i. q.<br>\
بَقَّةٌ. (A, K.) A poet speaks of the humming of<br>\
the بعوض of the water. (TA.) The author of<br>\
the K says, in the B, that the word is taken from<br>\
بَعْضٌ, because of the smallness of the body of the<br>\
بعوضة in comparison with other living things.<br>\
(TA.) You say, كَلَّفَنِى مُخَّ البَعُوضِ (tropical:) He imposed upon me a difficult thing: (A:) or an<br>\
impossible thing. (TS, K.)<br>\
