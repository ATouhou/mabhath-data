displaced it; (K, * TA;) as also ↓ ابتزّهُ, and ↓ بَزْبَزَهُ.<br>\
(TA.) It is said in a prov., مَنْ عَزَّ بَزَّ He who<br>\

Ibn-Zuheyr El-Hudhalee [cited in art. ريب, but<br>\
with this difference, that يَجُرُّ is there put in the<br>\
place of يَبُزُّ]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [بَزَّهُ is also explained<br>\
in the TA by حَبَسَهُ; but without any ex.; and I<br>\
think it probable that حَبَسَهُ is a mistake for جَذَبَهُ].<br>\

(S, A,) or of the merchant: (Msb:) or the furniture of a house or tent, consisting of cloths or<br>\

بُزُوزٌ; (A;) meaning, in conjunction with خُزُوزٌ,<br>\
(i. e., خُزُوزٌ وَ بُزُوزٌ,) good cloths or stuffs or garments. (A.) [Golius explains it as “Chald.<br>\
בוּץ,<br>\
Byssus, seu potius pannus lineus, bombacinus,<br>\
etiam sericus:” as on the authority of the S and<br>\
K (though he omits the explanations in both<br>\
those lexicons) and Meyd and Ibn-Maaroof (who<br>\
explains it only by the Persian word جَامَهْ, meaning cotton or linen cloth, or a garment,) and the<br>\
Mirkát el-Loghah. He seems to have judged<br>\
from its resemblance in sound to the Chaldee and<br>\
Latin words with which he identifies it. The<br>\
things which it signifies, however, may perhaps<br>\
be so called because they are usual spoils: and<br>\
hence also, perhaps, the application here next<br>\
following.]<br>\

his neck. (A.) And كَامِلَةٍ ↓ غَزَا فِى بِزَّةٍ He went<br>\

بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ Then it shall be by spoliation, and the<br>\
taking of possessions without right: or, as some<br>\
relate this trad., ↓ بَزْبَزِيًّا; but accord. to Az, this<br>\
is naught. (TA.) You say also, رَجَعَتِ الخلَافَةُ<br>\
