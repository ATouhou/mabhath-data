بَقِيَ aor. يَبْقَى, inf. n. بَقَآءٌ (JK, S, Msb, K)<br>\
and بَاقِيَةٌ; (Msb; [but see this latter below;])<br>\
[and accord. to the CK, بَقًى and بَقْىٌ; but this<br>\
is a mistake; وَبَقَى و بَقْيًا being there erroneously<br>\
put for بَقَى بَقْيًا, explained by what here follows;]<br>\
and بَقَى, [by some written بَقَا,] (JK, S, Msb, K,)<br>\
aor. as above, (JK,) inf. n. بَقْىٌ, (K,) of the dial.<br>\
of Belhárith Ibn-Kaab, (TA,) or of that of Teiyi,<br>\
(JK, S, TA,) who in like manner say بَقَتْ instead<br>\
of بَقَيَتْ, (S, TA,) and the like is done in other<br>\
verbs of the same class, (S, Msb,) whether the<br>\
kesreh and the ى be original, as in بَقِىَ and نَسِىَ<br>\
and فَنِىَ, or accidental, as in the pass. verbs هُدِىَ<br>\
and بُنِىَ; (Msb;) [He, or] it, namely, a thing,<br>\
remained, continued, lasted, endured: and was,<br>\
or became, permanent, or perpetual; or continued,<br>\
lasted, or existed, incessantly, always, endlessly,<br>\
or for ever: syn. دَامَ, and ثَبَتَ; (Msb;) contr.<br>\
of فَنِىَ: (K:) بَقَآءٌ signifies a thing&#39;s remaining,<br>\
continuing, lasting, or enduring, in its first state,<br>\
to a period determined by the will of God, either<br>\
with respect to its corporeal substance, as in the<br>\
case of a heavenly orb, or with respect to its kind<br>\
only, as in the case of the human and other<br>\
animal races; and the continuing, lasting, or<br>\
existing, for ever, either by self, as in the instance<br>\
of God alone, or otherwise, and thus either with<br>\
respect to the corporeal substance, as in the case<br>\
of an inhabitant of Paradise, or with respect to<br>\
kind only, as in the case of the fruits of the inhabitants of Paradise. (Er-Rághib, TA.) [Hence,]<br>\
دَارُ البَقَآءِ [The abode of everlasting existence;] the<br>\
world to come. (T in art. دور.) The verb is said<br>\
of a thing; and in like manner of a man, as in<br>\
بَقِىَ زَمَانًا طَوِيلًا, i. e. He lived [or continued in<br>\
life] a long time. (S.) [You say also, بَقِىَ عَلَى<br>\
حَالِهِ He, or it, remained, or continued, in his,<br>\
or its, state, or condition; i. e., as he, or it, was.<br>\
And بَقِىَ عَلَى الشِّدَّةِ He endured, or bore up<br>\
against, difficulty, distress, or adversity.] And<br>\
بَقِى مِنَ الشَّىْءِ بَقِيَّةٌ [A remain, remainder, remnant, relic, or residue, of the thing remained.]<br>\
(S.) And بَقِىَ مِنْهُ كَذَا Such a thing remained,<br>\
over and above, and behind, thereof; as also<br>\
↓ تبقّى. (Msb.)<br>\

the last radical, (K,) first pers. بَقَيْتُهُ (Lh, S) and<br>\
بَقَوْتُهُ, (Lh, TA,) aor. of the former<br>\
بَقِىَ, (S,) inf. n.<br>\
بَقْىٌ, [of the former verb,] (K,) He looked at<br>\
him, or it: (Lh, S, K:) or [so in the K, but in<br>\
the S “ and,”] he watched, or observed, him, or<br>\
it: (S, K:) and بَقَيْتُهُ I looked, watched, or<br>\
waited, for him, or it; (TA in art. بقو;) as also<br>\
بَقَوْتُهُ; (K in that art.;) but the former is the<br>\
more approved. (TA in that art.) [See also art.<br>\
بقو.] You say also, فُلَانٌ يَبْقِى الشَّىْءَ بِبَصَرِهِ Such<br>\
a one looks at the thing, and watches, or observes,<br>\
it. (JK.) And it is said in a trad., بَقَيْنَا رَسُولَ اللّٰهِ<br>\
We looked, watched, or waited, for the Apostle<br>\
of God. (S.)<br>\

بَقَّىَ see 4, in two places.<br>\
4<br>\
ابقاهُ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ بقّاهُ and ↓ تبقّاهُ (S,<br>\
K) all signify the same, (S,) and ↓ استبقاهُ likewise, (K,) He made, or caused, [and he suffered,]<br>\
him, or it, to remain, continue, last; to be, or<br>\
become, permanent, or perpetual; to continue,<br>\
last, or exist, incessantly, always, endlessly, or<br>\
for ever; he continued it; he perpetuated it.<br>\
(Msb, K *) You say, ابقاهُ اللّٰهُ [God preserved<br>\
him, or prolonged his life; or may God preserve<br>\
him, or prolong his life; or] God made him, or<br>\
caused him, or may God make him, or cause him,<br>\
to continue in life. (S.) And أَبْقَى أَصْلَ الشَّىْءِ<br>\
وَجَعَلَ ثَمَرَهُ فِى سَبِيلِ اللّٰهِ He made the thing itself<br>\
to remain unalienable, not to be inherited nor<br>\
sold nor given away, and assigned the profit<br>\
arising from it to be employed in the cause of<br>\
God, or of religion. (TA in art. حبس.) And<br>\
أَبْقَيْتُ مَا بَيْنَنَا I was sparing of marring, i. e.,<br>\
forbore from marring much, or exceedingly, that<br>\
[state of union or amity] which subsisted between<br>\
us. (K.) And نَعْلَيْكَ وَابْذُلْ قَدَمَيْكَ ↓ بَقِّ [Pre-<br>\
serve thou, or spare thou, thy sandals, and use<br>\
freely, or unsparingly, thy feet]: a prov. (Meyd.<br>\
See Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i. 149.) And ↓ تَبَقَّهْ<br>\
وَتَوَقَّهْ Preserve thou the soul (النَّفْسَ ↓ اِسْتَبْقِ),<br>\
expose it not to destruction, [meaning preserve<br>\
thyself,] and guard against evils, or calamities:<br>\
a trad.: the ه in each verb is that of pausation.<br>\
(TA.) [And ابقى مِنَ الشَّىْءِ بَقِيَّةً He left, or<br>\
reserved, of the thing, a remain, remainder, remnant, &amp;c.:] and مِنَ الشَّىْءِ ↓ استبقى He left a<br>\
portion of the thing; (S, K;) as also ↓ تبقّى;<br>\
whence the prov., used to incite to liberality,<br>\
↓ لَا يَنْفَعُكَ مِنْ زَادٍ تَبَقٍّ Leaving a portion of travel-ling-provision will not profit thee. (JK.) [And<br>\
ابقى الشَّىْءِ and ↓ استبقاهُ He reserved the thing<br>\
for a future time or use &amp;c.] And ↓ استبقاهُ as<br>\
meaning [He spared him; he let him live;] he<br>\
left him alive; (S, K;) [as also ابقاهُ; for] men<br>\
say to their enemies when the latter have overcome, أَبْقُونَا وَ لَا تَسْتَأْصِلُونَا [Spare ye us, and<br>\
destroy us not entirely]: (TA:) [or ابقاهُ, in a<br>\
case of this kind,] and ابقى عَلَيْهِ and ↓ استبقاهُ<br>\
signify He pardoned him, [and forbore to slay<br>\
him,] when slaughter was his due: (TA:) and<br>\
↓ استبقاهُ signifies also He pardoned, or forgave,<br>\
his fault, wrong action, or lapse into sin, and<br>\
preserved his love, or affection. (JK, TA. *) And<br>\
[hence,] أَبْقَيْتُ عَلَى فُلَانٍ signifies also I showed<br>\
mercy to such a one [by sparing him, or letting<br>\
him live, or by pardoning him, or otherwise];<br>\
had mercy on him; pitied, or compassionated,<br>\
him; syn. أَرْعَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ and رَحِمْتُهُ. (S.) One says,<br>\
لَا أَبْقَى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ إِنْ أَبْقَيْتَ عَلَىَّ [May God not<br>\
show mercy to thee if thou show mercy to<br>\
me: a prov., said in derision to one who affects<br>\
to show mercy when unable to take revenge].<br>\
(S, Meyd.) And لَا تُبْقِ إِلَّا عَلَى نَفْسِكَ [Show not<br>\
mercy save to thyself: another prov., similar to<br>\
the former]. (Meyd.) And it is said, in a trad.,<br>\
of the fire [of Hell], لَا تُبْقِى عَلَى مَنْ تَضَرَّعَ إِلَيْهَا,<br>\
i. e. It will not pity [him who abases himself to<br>\
it: or rather it will not spare &amp;c.: and in like<br>\
manner, لَا تُبْقِى وَلَا تَذَرُ, in the Kur lxxiv. 28, is<br>\
generally understood as meaning It (namely,<br>\
Hell,) will not spare, nor leave unburned]. (TA.)<br>\

بَقْوَى: see بُقْيَا, in five places.<br>\
بُقوَى: see بُقْيَا, in two places.<br>\
بَقْيَا: see what next follows.<br>\
بُقْيَا (JK, S, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ بَقْيَا (TA) and<br>\
↓ بَقْوَى (JK, S, Msb, K) and ↓ بُقْوَى (Th, K) and<br>\
↓ (JK, K,) the ↓ third and ↓ fourth with ى<br>\
changed into و, like as و is changed into ى in<br>\
دُنْيَا and عُلْيَا and قُصْيَا, (ISd, TA,) [substs. in the<br>\
sense of إِبْقَآءٌ, inf. n. of 4, signifying The making,<br>\
or causing, and suffering, to remain, continue,<br>\
last, &amp;c.; preservation of a person in life, and of<br>\
a thing in being; and the sparing, letting live, or<br>\
leaving alive;] substs. from أَبْقَاهُ: (Msb, K:) or<br>\
[the showing mercy by sparing or letting live, or<br>\
by pardoning, or otherwise; having mercy; pitying, or compassionating;] substs. from أَبْقَيْتُ عَلَى<br>\
فُلَانٍ. (S.) Thus one says of a pilgrim, that he<br>\
put gum, or something glutinous, upon his head,<br>\
and so caused his hair to become compacted,<br>\
بُقْيَا عَلَيْهِ to preserve it in the state in which it was<br>\
(expl. by إِبْقَآءً عليه), lest it should become shaggy,<br>\
or dishevelled, &amp;c. (L in art. لبد.) And one says,<br>\
نَشَدْتُكَ اللّٰهَ وَالبُقْيَا and ↓ البَقْوَى [I conjure, or beg,<br>\
or beseech, thee by God and by the preservation<br>\
of thy life]. (JK.) And مَا لِى عَلَيْه رَعْوَى وَلَا<br>\
↓ بَقْوَى [I have no mercy nor pity to bestow upon<br>\
him]. (JK. [There expl. by the words أَىْ أَرْعَيْتُ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ وَأَبْقَيْتُ; but أَىْ is evidently a mistranscription for مِنْ, i. e. from.]) A poet (El-La&#39;een ElMinkaree, TA) says,<br>\
فَمَا بُقْيَا عَلَىَّ تَرَكْتُمَانِى<br>\
وَلٰكِنْ خِفْتُمَا صَرَدَ النِّبَالِ<br>\
[And it was not to show mercy by sparing me<br>\
that ye two left me; but ye feared the transpiercing of the arrows]. (S.) And another says,<br>\
on his having refused to accept an offer of seven<br>\
bloodwits,<br>\
أُذَكَّرُ بِالبُقْيَا عَلَى مَنْ أَصَابَنِى<br>\
وَبُقْيَاىَ أَنِّى جَاهِدٌ غَيْرُ مُؤْتَلِى<br>\
i. e. Am I required [or exhorted or reminded] to<br>\
show mercy to him who slew my relation, when<br>\
the mercy that I show to him is that I am<br>\
labouring to slay him, and not falling short, or<br>\
being remiss: by بقياى is meant إِبْقَائِى عَلَيْهِ;<br>\
though الإِبْقَآء is not الجَهْد: the meaning is, that<br>\
this is done by me in lieu of that: البُقْيَا is a subst.<br>\
from الإِبْقَآء, syn. therewith; and the و prefixed<br>\
to it is a denotative of state. (Ham p. 119. [This<br>\
verse is also cited in the TA, but with the substitution of ↓ بِالبَقْوَى and وَبَقْوَاى for the corresponding words above.] ↓ البَقِيَّةَ is said by men to their<br>\
enemies when the latter have overcome; meaning<br>\
[We ask, or beg, the being spared, or mercy, or<br>\
quarter; a verb, whereby it is governed, being<br>\
understood: or] أَبْقُونَا وَلَا تَسْتَأْصِلُونَا [spare ye us,<br>\
and destroy us not entirely]. (TA.)<br>\
بَقِيَّةٌ A remain, remainder, remaining portion,<br>\
remnant, relic, residue, or the remains, or rest,<br>\
of a thing; (KL, PS, &amp;c.;) a subst. from<br>\
بَقِىَ as signifying “ it remained over and above,”<br>\
and “ it remained behind: ” pl. بَقَايَا and بَقِيَّاتٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) ↓ بَاقِيَةٌ, also, [pl. بَوَاقٍ and بَاقِيَاتٌ,] has<br>\
the same meaning as بَقِيَّةٌ; (TA;) [i. e., as explained above; and so has ↓ بَاقٍ, for شَىْءٍ بَاقٍ &amp;c.]<br>\
You say, بَقِىَ مِنَ الشَّىْءِ بَقِيَّةٌ [explained before:<br>\
see 1]. (S.) [And هُمْ بَقِيَّةُ السَّيْفِ, and بَقَايَا السَّيْفِ,<br>\
They are those who have been spared by the<br>\
sword]. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] فُلَانٌ مِنْ بَقِيَّةِ القَوْمِ Such a<br>\
one is of the best of the people, or company of<br>\
men: because a man reserves the most excellent<br>\
of the things that he produces. (Bd in xi. 118.)<br>\
And فُلَانٌ مِنْ بَقِيَّةِ أَهْلِهِ Such a one is of the most<br>\
excellent of his people, or family. (Ham p. 78.)<br>\
And فُلَانٌ بَقِيَّةُ القَوْمِ Such a one is the best of the<br>\
people, or company of men: pl. بَقَايَا. (Kull<br>\
p. 96.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أُولُو بَقِيَّةٍ, in the Kur xi. 118, hence<br>\
means Persons possessed of excellence: [see a<br>\
phrase mentioned voce بَلَلٌ:] or possessing a relic<br>\
of judgment and intelligence: (Bd:) or persons<br>\
of religion and excellence: (Jel:) or persons of<br>\
understanding (K, TA) and discrimination: (TA:)<br>\
or persons of obedience: (TA:) or having the<br>\
quality of preserving themselves (Az, Bd, K, *)<br>\
from punishment, (Bd,) by their holding the<br>\
approved religion: (Az, TA:) and this last explanation is confirmed by another reading, which is<br>\
↓ اولوا بَقْيَةٍ [possessing a quality of watching, or<br>\
observing, and hence, of guarding, or preserving];<br>\
بَقْيَة being the inf. n. of un. of بَقَاهُ, aor. يَبْقِيهِ,<br>\
signifying “ he watched,” or “ observed,” &amp;c.,<br>\
“ him,” or “ it. ” (Bd.) See also بُقَيَا, in two<br>\
places. بَقِيَّةٌ is also a subst. from أَبْقَيْتُ مَا بَيْنَنَا<br>\
[explained before: see 4: app. meaning Forbearance from marring much, or exceedingly, the state<br>\
of unity, or of amity, subsisting between two persons, or parties: and such may be its meaning in<br>\
the phrase above-mentioned (اولوا بقيّة)]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
بَقِيَّةُ اللّٰهِ, in the Kur xi. 87, [after the command,<br>\
in the next preceding verse, to give full measure<br>\
and weight,] means God&#39;s sustenance that remains<br>\
for you after your giving full measure [and<br>\
weight]: (Jel:) or that which God has preserved<br>\
for you, of what is lawful, (Fr, Bd,) after [your]<br>\
keeping aloof from that which he has forbidden<br>\
you: (Bd:) or the good state, or condition, remaining for you: (Zj, K:) or the fear (مُرَاقَبَة)<br>\
of God; accord. to some: (Fr, TA:) or the<br>\
obedience of God, and (as Aboo-&#39;Alee says, TA)<br>\
the looking for his recompense: (K, TA:) or<br>\
بَقِيَّةٌ and ↓ بَاقِيَةٌ signify any religious service<br>\
whereby one seeks to obtain the recompense of<br>\
God; and such is the meaning of the former in<br>\
this instance. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also بَاقِيَةٌ.<br>\
بَاقٍ part. n. of بَقِىَ [in all its senses; Remaining,<br>\
continuing, lasting, or enduring: and permanent,<br>\
or perpetual; or continuing, lasting, or existing,<br>\
incessantly, always, endlessly, or for ever: &amp;c.:<br>\
see 1]. (Er-Rághib, TA.) البَاقِى, a name of God,<br>\
[as also, pleonastically, البَاقِى الأَبَدِىُّ, means The<br>\
Everlasting, or] He whose existence will have no<br>\
end. (TA.) See also بَقِيَّةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  البَاقِى also signifies<br>\
The حَاصِل [or net produce, or perhaps simply<br>\
the produce,] of the [tax termed] خَرَاج, and the<br>\
like. (Lth, JK, TA.)<br>\
بَاقِيَةٌ: see بَقِيَّةٌ, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  البَاقِيَاتُ الصَّالِحَاتُ<br>\
[in the Kur xviii. 44, and xix. 79,] means Any<br>\
righteous, or good, work, (K, TA,) of which the<br>\
recompense remains: (TA:) or acts of obedience,<br>\
(Bd and Jel in xix. 79,) or good works, (Bd in<br>\
xviii. 44,) of which the fruit remains for ever:<br>\
(Bd in both those places, and Jel * in the former:)<br>\
and, as included therein, [so Bd, but in the K<br>\
“ or,”] the five prayers; (Bd, K;) and the performance of the pilgrimage; and the keeping the<br>\
fast of Ramadán; (Bd in xviii. 44;) and [so<br>\
Bd, but in the K “ or,”] the saying, سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ<br>\
وَ الحَمْدُلِلّٰهِ وَ لَا إِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَ اللّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ; (Bd and Jel<br>\
in xviii. 44, and K;) to which some add, وَ لَا حَوْلَ<br>\
وَ لَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللّٰهِ: (Jel ibid.:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib, the correct meaning is any religious<br>\
service whereby one seeks to obtain the recompense<br>\
of God: see also بَقِيَّةٌ, last explanation. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  بَاقِيَةٌ is sometimes put in the place of an<br>\
inf. n.; (S, K;) or it is an inf. n.; (Msb;) syn.<br>\
with بَقَآءٌ; (S, Msb, TA;) with which ↓ بَقِيَّةٌ, also,<br>\
is syn. (TA in art. سرع.) So in the Kur [lxix. 8],<br>\
فَهَلْ تَرَى لَهُمْ مِنْ بَاقِيَةٍ [And dost thou see them to<br>\
have any continuance?]; (S, TA;) so says Fr:<br>\
(TA:) or, as some say, the meaning is, بَقِيَّةٍ [i. e.<br>\
a remnant]: (TA:) or جَمَاعَةٍ بَاقِيَةٍ [a company<br>\
remaining]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or نَفْسٍ بَاقِيَةٍ [a<br>\
soul, or person, remaining]: (Bd, Jel:) or the ة<br>\
is an intensive affix; (Jel;) [or a restrictive to<br>\
unity;] i. e. one remaining; (Jel, TA;) and this<br>\
is also allowable and good: one says, likewise,<br>\
مَا بَقِيَتْ بَاقِيَةٌ وَ لَا وَ قَاهُمْ مِنَ اللّٰهِ وَاقِيَةٌ [One remaining remained not, nor did one preserver preserve<br>\
them from God]. (TA.)<br>\
أَبْقَى Longer continuing. (Bd and Jel in xx. 74,<br>\
&amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  هُوَ أَبْقَى الرَّجُلَيْنِ means أَكْثَرُ إِبْقَآءً عَلَى<br>\
قَوْمِهِ [He is the more merciful, or pitiful, or<br>\
compassionate, of the two men, towards his<br>\
people]. (TA.)<br>\
نَاقَةٌ مُبْقِيَةٌ A she-camel [that retains some milk;]<br>\
that does not exhaust her copious supply of milk.<br>\
(JK.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مُبْقِيَاتُ الخَيْلِ, (K,) or rather المُبْقِيَاتُ<br>\
مِنَ الخَيْلِ, (TA,) The horses whose running continues after the running of other horses has<br>\
ceased: (M, K:) or, that reserve somewhat of<br>\
their running. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And المُبْقِيَاتُ The<br>\
places that retain some of the pools in which<br>\
water has collected, and do not drink it up.<br>\
