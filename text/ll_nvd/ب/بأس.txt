بَؤُسَ, aor. يَبْؤُسُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
بَأْسٌ, (S, Msb, K,) or بَأْسَةٌ; (M; [so I find in a<br>\
copy of the M, but perhaps it is a mistranscription<br>\
for بَآسَةٌ;]) and بَئِسَ, [aor. يَبْأَسُ,] inf. n. بَأْسٌ;<br>\
(M;) He was, or became, mighty, or strong, in<br>\
war or fight; (K;) courageous, or valiant: (M,<br>\
Msb, K:) or very mighty or strong in war or<br>\
fight. (AZ, S.)<br>\
-A2-  بَئْسُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
يَبْأَسُ (S, M, K) and يَبْئِسُ, the latter extr., like<br>\
يَنْعِمُ aor. of نَعِمَ, (M,) [and some other instances,<br>\
(see حَسِبَ,)] inf. n. بُؤْسٌ (S, Msb, * K) and بُؤُوسٌ<br>\
and بُؤْسَى (K) and بَأْسٌ (TA) and بَئيسٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
[in measure] like أَمِيرٌ, (TA,) [accord. to the CK<br>\
بِئْسٌ, which is a mistake,] and بَئِيسَى, (TS, TA,)<br>\
incorrectly written in the copies of the K بِئْسَي;<br>\
(TA;) or بَؤُسَ; (A;) or both these forms; (M;) He<br>\
was, or became, in a state of distress; straitened in<br>\
his means of subsistence, or in the conveniences of<br>\
life; (M, Msb;) in a state of poverty: (M, A, Msb, *<br>\
TA:) or in a state of pressing want: (S, K, TA:)<br>\
and بَؤُسَ, inf. n. بَآسَةٌ and بَئِيسٌ, whence the subst.<br>\
بَؤْسَى, he was, or became, in a state of trial, or<br>\
affliction: (M:) and [in like manner,] ↓ أَبْأَسَ,<br>\
(inf. n. إِبْآسٌ,S,) distress, or poverty, or misfortune, or calamity, (البَأْسَآءُ,) befell him. (IAar, S, *<br>\
M, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  بِئْسَ, also written بَئِسَ and بِئِسَ and<br>\
بَأْسَ, (S, K,) is a word of dispraise or blame, (S,)<br>\
implying all kinds of dispraise or blame, (TA,)<br>\
[or superlative dispraise or blame; signifying,<br>\
Very evil or bad is he, or it: or superlatively<br>\
evil or bad is he, or it:] contr. of نِعمَ: (S, M,<br>\
TA:) a pret. verb, imperfectly inflected, (S, K,)<br>\
like نِعْمَ, (S,) [having only one variation of form,<br>\
namely, the fem. بِئْسَتْ, though the masc. is more<br>\
commonly used even when the agent is fem. or<br>\
pl.,] because it is translated from its original<br>\
application, (S, K,) i. e. from بَئِسَ فُلَانٌ signifying<br>\
أَصَابَ بُؤْسًا [he found, met with, or experienced,<br>\
distress, &amp;c.], to signify dispraise or blame. (S,<br>\
TA.) When it is accompanied by a gen. n. without the article ال, this is always in the accus.<br>\
case: but when the n. has the article ال, it is<br>\
always in the nom. case: (TA:) you say, بِئْسَ<br>\
رَجُلًا زَيْدً [Very evil or bad, or superlatively evil<br>\
or bad, as a man, is Zeyd; رجلا being a specificative]: (K:) and بِئْسَ الرَّجُلُ زَيْدٌ [Very evil,<br>\
&amp;c., is the man, Zeyd]; and بِئْسَتِ المَرْأَةُ هِنْدٌ [or<br>\
more commonly بِئْسَ العَيْرُ in this case also, Very evil,<br>\
&amp;c., is the woman, Hind]. (S.) Some argue<br>\
that it is a noun, from the saying, نِعْمَ السَّيْرُ عَلَى<br>\
بِئْسَ العَيْرُ, because it has a prep.; but this is<br>\
explained as elliptical, and meaning, نِعَمَ السَّيْرُ<br>\
عَلَى عَيْرٍ مَقُولٍ فِيهِ بِئْسَ العيْرُ [Excellent is the<br>\
journeying upon an ass of which it is said Very<br>\
evil, &amp;c., is the ass]. (I &#39;Ak p. 232.) Zj says that<br>\
when it is followed by مَا, then مَا, with it, is<br>\
regarded as occupying the place of an indeterminate noun; [namely, شَيْئًا, as a specificative; as<br>\
in the Kur ii. 84,بِئْسَ مَا اشْتَرَوا بِهِ أَنْفُسَهُمْ, or بِئْسَمَا,<br>\
&amp;c., Very evil, &amp;c., as a thing, is that for which<br>\
they have sold, or exchanged, themselves:] (TA:)<br>\
but some say that it is the agent, and is a determinate noun; and this is the opinion of Ibn-Kharoof, which he ascribes to Sb. (I &#39;Ak ubi<br>\
suprà.) [For further illustration, see نِعْمَ.]<br>\

تَبَآءَسَ He feigned the lowliness, or submissiveness, of poverty, humbling, or abasing, himself,<br>\
(K,* TA,) with men; and ↓ تَبَأَّسَ is allowable in<br>\
the same sense. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
ابتأس بِهِ, (M, A,) and مِنْهُ, (S, TA,) He<br>\
was distressed by it, or at it; it does not signify<br>\
dislike: (IB, TA:) or he grieved at it, (S, M,<br>\
A,) and humbled and abased himself: so in the<br>\
Kur xi. 38 and xii. 69. (M, A, TA.) It is said<br>\
of a man when a thing that he dislikes becomes<br>\
known to him. (AZ, TA.)<br>\
بَأْسٌ Might, or strength, (S, A, Msb, K,) in<br>\
war or fight: (S, A, K:) courage; valour, or<br>\
valiantness; prowess. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  War, or fight;<br>\
(M, Msb;) as also ↓ بَئِيْسٌ (M) and ↓ بَأْسَآءُ:<br>\
(TA:) pl. of the first,أَبْؤَسٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence,<br>\
(M,) (assumed tropical:)  Fear, (M, TA,) in the saying, لَا بأْسَ<br>\
عَلَيْكَ, (M, TA, *) and بِكَ, (M,) [(assumed tropical:)  There is no<br>\
fear for thee: lit., there is no war against thee,<br>\
or with thee]: the saying of which to an enemy<br>\
implies the granting him security, or protection:<br>\
and in the same sense it is used in a trad.,<br>\
in the phrase اِشْتَدَّ البَأْسُ [(assumed tropical:)  Fear became vehement]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  I. q. ضَرَرٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Harm, injury,<br>\
&amp;c.]: so in the phrase لَا بَأْسَ [There is, or will<br>\
be, no harm, &amp;c.; and لَا بَأْسَ بِكَذَا, and فِى كَذَا,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  There is, or will be, no harm in such a thing].<br>\
(Har p. 311.) It is said in a trad., لَا بَأْسَ بِالْغِنَي<br>\
لِمَنِ اتَّقَي [There is no harm in wealth to him<br>\
who is pious]. (El-Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer of Es-Suyootee.) بَاس also occurs for بَأْس; the being<br>\
suppressed, agreeably with analogy; not altered<br>\
by permutation. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Punishment: (S,<br>\
A, K:) or severe punishment; (TA;) as also<br>\
↓ بَئِسٌ, in measure like كَتِفٌ. (IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
See also بُؤْسٌ, in two places.<br>\
بُؤْسٌ (also written بُوسٌ, with the suppressed,<br>\
Msb) Distress; straitness of the means of subsistence, or of the conveniences of life; poverty:<br>\
(M, Msb,* TA:*) or a state of pressing want:<br>\
(S, K:) or misfortune; calamity: (A:) and<br>\
↓ بُؤُوسٌ and ↓ بُؤْسَى (K, TA) and ↓ بَأْسَآءُ (M, A)<br>\
and ↓ بَأْسٌ (TA) and ↓ بَئِيسٌ (S, K) and ↓ بَئِيسَى<br>\
(TA) and ↓ مَبْأَسَةٌ (M, TA) [all of which, except<br>\
↓ بَأْسَآءُ and ↓ مَبْأَسَةٌ, are said to be inf. ns. (see<br>\
بَئِسَ)] signify the same as بُؤْسٌ: (S, M, A, K,<br>\
TA:) ↓ بُؤْسَى and ↓ بَأْسَآءُ are both from بُؤْسٌ<br>\
[with which they are syn. accord. to authorities<br>\
indicated above]; (Zj, IDrd, TA;) the former is<br>\
contr. of نُعْمَى, (S, TA,) and in like manner the<br>\
latter is contr. of نَعْمَآءُ: (TA:) the latter is of<br>\
the measure فَعْلَآءُ without any أَفْعَلُ, because it<br>\
is a subst.; like as أَفْعَلُ occurs among substs.<br>\
without any فَعَلَآءُ, as in the instance of أَحْمَدُ:<br>\
(Akh, S:) or ↓ بُؤْسَى signifies a state of trial<br>\
or affliction, and is a subst.; and ↓ بَئِيسٌ and<br>\
↓ بَآسَةٌ signify the same, but are inf. ns.: (M:) and<br>\
↓ بَأْسَآءُ is syn. with شِدَّةٌ [like بُؤْسٌ in the first of<br>\
the senses explained above]; (S, TA;) and مَشَقَّةٌ<br>\
[meaning distress, or difficulty]: (TA:) or it<br>\
signifies misfortune, or calamity, (A, K,) like<br>\
بُؤْسٌ; (A;) and so أَبْؤُسٌ: (S, K:) or rather this<br>\
last signifies misfortunes, or calamities; for it<br>\
is pl. of ↓ بَأْسٌ, i. e., a pl. of pauc.; not of بُؤْسٌ,<br>\
as J asserts it to be; for the pl. of pauc. of بُؤْسٌ<br>\
is أَبْآسٌ: (IB, TA:) but أَبْؤُسٌ may be used as<br>\
pl. of ↓ بَأْسَآءُ. (Fr, in S, voce ضَرَّآءُ, q. v.) [See<br>\
exs. of these two pls. in what follows.] You say<br>\
يَوْمُ بُؤْسٍ وَيَوْمُ نُعْمٍ [A day of distress, or poverty,<br>\
&amp;c., and a day of ease and plenty]. (S, TA.)<br>\
And بُؤْسًا لَهُ [May distress, or poverty, &amp;c., befall<br>\
him]: a form of imprecation. (Sb, M, TA.) And<br>\
بُؤْسَ ابْنِ سُمَيَّةَ, app. an expression of pity [meaning Alas for the distress, &amp;c., of Ibn-Sumeiyeh!].<br>\
(TA, from a trad.) And عَسَىَ الغُوَيْرُ أَبْؤُسًا Perhaps the little cave [may be attended with] calamities; not calamity, as in the S [and K]: (IB:)<br>\
a prov.; (S;) originating from a cave&#39;s having<br>\
collapsed upon some men in it; or from an<br>\
enemy&#39;s having come to some men in a cave,<br>\
and slain them; wherefore it is applied to anything whence evil is feared: (As, S, K, in art.<br>\
غور:) or it is applied to him who is suspected<br>\
of a thing: (IAar, TA:) or الغُوَيْرُ was the name<br>\
of a certain water, which belonged to the tribe<br>\
of Kelb, and the words of this prov. were said<br>\
by Ez-Zebbà, when Kaseer turned aside from<br>\
the plain road, and took the way to الغُوَيْرُ: (Ibn-El-Kelbee, S, K, in art. غور:)ابؤسا is in the<br>\
accus. case by reason of يَكُونُ understood. (Mughnee.) [See Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 94.] ElKumeyt also says,<br>\
قَالُوا أَسَآءَ بَنُو كُرْزٍ فَقُلْتُ لَهُمْ<br>\
عَسَى الغُوَيْرُ بِأَبْآسٍ وَأغْوَارِ<br>\
[They said, Benoo-Kurz have done evil: and<br>\
I said to them, Perhaps the little cave may be<br>\
attended with calamities and connected with<br>\
other caves]: أَبْآس is here pl. of بُؤْس. (IB,<br>\
TA.) [In the S, the last words are written<br>\
بِإِبْآسٍ وَإِعْوَارٍ, in one copy: in another, وإِغْوَارِ:<br>\
both of which are app. wrong.] ―<br>\

بَأْسَآءُ: see بَأْسٌ: and بُؤْسٌ: the latter, in five<br>\

-b2-  Zj explains it as signifying, in the<br>\
Kur vi. 42, Hunger. (M, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The<br>\
act of beating, or striking. (Lth, TA.)<br>\
بَؤُوسٌ One in whom بُؤْس [i. e. distress &amp;c.]<br>\
is apparent, or manifest. (M, TA.)<br>\

(A;) courageous, or valiant. (S, M, Msb, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  عَذَابٌ بئِيسٌ, (S, M, K,) and ↓ بِئِيسٌ, agreeably<br>\
with a general rule applying to words of this<br>\
description, (M,) and ↓ بِئْسٌ, (M, K,) and ↓ بَئِسٌ,<br>\
(M,) and ↓ بَيْئَسٌ, (M, K,) and ↓ بَئْئَسٌ, (M,)<br>\
and ↓ بَيِّسٌ, and ↓ بَيْسٌ, which last, however, is<br>\
of no authority, (M,) or ↓ بِيسٌ, and بَيِيسٌ, with<br>\
the changed into ى, (TA,) A vehement punishment: (S, M, K:) so in the Kur vii. 165. (TA.)<br>\
بِئِيسٌ: see بَئيسٌ.<br>\
بَآسَةٌ: see بُؤْسٌ.<br>\
بَئِيسَي: see بُؤْسٌ.<br>\
بَائِسٌ Distressed; straitened in his means of<br>\
subsistence, or in the conveniences of life; (Msb;)<br>\
or poor: (A, Msb: *) or one who is in want,<br>\
and an object of pity for what he suffers: (TA:)<br>\
or in a state of pressing want: (S:) or in a state<br>\
of trial, or affliction: (M, TA:) or one who<br>\
is crippled, or deprived of the power of motion,<br>\
by disease, or who suffers from a protracted<br>\
disease, and is in need: (Mgh:) an epithet denoting pity, (Sb, M, TA,) or grief: (Mgh:)<br>\
↓ بُؤْسٌ occurs as its pl.; (M, TA;) or is for<br>\
ذَوُوبُؤْسٍ. (M.)<br>\
بَيْئَسٌ and بَيْئِسٌ: see بَئِيسٌ. ―<br>\
