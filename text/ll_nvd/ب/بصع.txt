بَصَعَ, aor.<br>\
بَصَعَ, (K,) inf. n. بَصْعٌ, (S,) He collected: (K:) [J says,] I have heard from certain<br>\
of the grammarians that البَصْعُ is syn. with الجَمْعُ,<br>\
but I know not what is the truth of the matter.<br>\
(S.) Hence what here follows. (TA.)<br>\
أَبْصَعُ is a word used as a corroborative, and is<br>\
pronounced by some with the pointed ض, but<br>\
this is not of high authority: you say, أَخَذْتُ حَقِّى<br>\
أَجْمَعَ أَبْصَعَ [I took my right, or due, altogether]:<br>\
and [the pl. is أَبْصَعُونَ:] you say, جَآءَ القَوْمُ<br>\
أَجْمَعُونَ أَبْصَعُونَ [The people, or company of men,<br>\
came all together]: and the fem. is بَصْعَآءُ: you<br>\
say, جَمْعَآءَ بَصْعَآءَ: and [the pl. of بَصْعَآءُ is بُصَعُ:<br>\
you say,] رَأَيْتُ النِّسْوَةَ جُمَعَ بُصَعَ [I saw the women<br>\
all together]: it is a corroborative occurring in a<br>\
particular order, never before اجمع. (S.) [See<br>\
أَبْتَعُ.]<br>\
