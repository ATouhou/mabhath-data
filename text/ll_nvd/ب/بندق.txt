بَنْدَقَ He made a thing into بَنَادِق [meaning bullets, or little balls], (Mgh, K,) or like<br>\
بنادق (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [In post-classical Arabic, He<br>\
shot a bullet, or bullets, from a cross-bow or<br>\
other weapon.] ―<br>\
-b2-  بندق إِلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  He looked sharply,<br>\
or intently, at him, or it. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
بُنْدُقٌ [The hazel-nut; or hazel-nuts; so in the<br>\
present day;] a certain thing that is eaten;<br>\
(Msb;) i. q. جِلَّوْز: (IDrd, K:) or, as some say,<br>\
like جلّوز; brought from an island; the best<br>\
whereof is the fresh, heavy, white, and sweet<br>\
in taste; the old being bad: it is beneficial<br>\
as a remedy for palpitation, parched with<br>\
anise-seed; and for poisons, and wasting of the<br>\
kidneys, and burning of the urine; and with<br>\
pepper, it excites the venereal faculty; with<br>\
sugar, it removes cough; and the shell thereof,<br>\
burnt, and applied as a collyrium, sharpens the<br>\
sight: (TA:) they assert that the suspending<br>\
it upon the upper arm preserves from scorpions,<br>\
(K,) i. e., from their stinging: (TA:) the moistening of the top of the head of a child with the<br>\
powder of it when burnt, together with oil, removes the blueness of its eyes and the redness of<br>\
its hair: and the Indian kind thereof is an antidote very beneficial to the eyes: (K, TA:) but<br>\
in some copies of the K, [and so in the CK,]<br>\
instead of لِلْعَيْنَيْنِ, we here find لِلْعِنِّينِ [for the<br>\
impotent in respect of the venereal faculty]:<br>\
(TA:) [it is said in the Msb that most hold the<br>\
ن to be augmentative: but this is not the case;<br>\
for] the word is Persian [arabicized, from فُنْدُقْ]:<br>\
(K:) [it is a coll. gen. n.:] n. un. with ة: pl.<br>\
بَنَادِقُ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, Bullets, i. e.] certain<br>\
things that one shoots, (S, Msb, K,) made of clay:<br>\
(Msb:) n. un. with ة: (S, Msb, K:) the latter<br>\
signifies a piece of clay, made round, which one<br>\
shoots, or casts; or i. q. جُلَاهِقٌ: (Mgh:) it is<br>\
said in the Shifá el-Ghaleel to be an arabicized<br>\
word: (TA:) pl. as above. (S, Msb.) [See a<br>\
prov. voce حِدَأَةٌ. Hence قَوْسُ البُنْدُقِ The crossbow. In modern Arabic, بُنْدُق is also applied to<br>\
Balls of any kind of the size of hazel-nuts: n. un.<br>\
with ة.]<br>\
بُنْدُقِىٌّ A garment, or piece of cloth, of fine,<br>\
delicate, or thin, linen. (Sgh, K.) [SM says,]<br>\
It is most probably, in my opinion, so called in<br>\
relation to the land of البُنْدُقِيَّة [or Venice]. (TA.)<br>\
[In modern Arabic, A Venetian sequin: pl.<br>\
بَنَادِقَةٌ.]<br>\
بُنْدَقَانِىٌّ [app. a post-classical word,] A maker<br>\
of cross-bows (قِسِىّ البُنْدُق). (El-Makreezee&#39;s<br>\
Khitat, art. خطّ البندقانيّين.)<br>\
