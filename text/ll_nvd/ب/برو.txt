بَرَوْتُهَا, i. e. النَّاقَةَ: see 4.<br>\
-A2-  بَرَوْتُهُ, (M,<br>\
Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
بَرُوَ, (Lth, T,) inf. n. بَرْوٌ, (M,) I<br>\
formed it, or fashioned it, by cutting; shaped<br>\
it out; or pared it; (K;) namely, a reed for<br>\
writing, (Lth, T, M, Msb, K,) and a stick, or<br>\
piece of wood, (M, K,) and an arrow, (K,)<br>\
[&amp;c.;] a dial. var. of بَرَيْتُهُ, (Lth, T, M, Msb,)<br>\
used by some, (Lth, T,) but the latter is the more<br>\
approved: (M, TA:) mentioned by AZ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, perhaps,] بَرَاهُ, aor.<br>\
بَرُوَ, inf. n. بَرْوٌ, He<br>\
(i. e. God) created him, or it: (Fr, S, K:) [but]<br>\
they affirm that it is originally بَرَأَهُ, with hemz:<br>\
(MF:) so says IAth: (TA:) or it is from بَرًا<br>\
or بَرًى, signifying “dust,” or “earth.” (Fr, S.)<br>\
-A3-  بَرَا, aor.<br>\
بَرُوَ, is also a bad dial. var. of بَرَأَ [signifying He, or it, recovered from disease, or<br>\
became convalescent, &amp;c.], aor. يَبْرُؤُ. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَبْرَيْتُهَا, (S, M, K,) i. e. النَّاقَةَ, (S, M,) I put<br>\
a [ring such as is termed] بُرَة in her (a camel&#39;s)<br>\
nose; (S, M, K;) as also ↓ بَرَوْتُهَا: (IJ, M, K:)<br>\
and ابريتهُ, namely, a camel, I put him a بُرَة.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  ابرى Dust, or earth, came, or lighted,<br>\
upon it. (K,* TA, in art. برى.)<br>\
بُرَةٌ (in which the final radical letter is elided,<br>\
[and replaced by ة,] Msb) A ring (T, S, M, &amp;c.)<br>\
of brass, (Lth, Lh, T, S, M, [in a copy of the<br>\
Msb, من صوف is erroneously put for مِنْ صُفْرٍ,])<br>\
or of silver, (Lth, T,) or of some other material,<br>\
(Lh, M,) slender, and bent at the two ends [lest<br>\
it should open at the place where the two ends<br>\
meet], that is put in the nose of a she-camel,<br>\
(Lth, T,) or put in the nose of the camel, (M,<br>\
Msb, K,) or in the flesh of the nose of the camel,<br>\
(Lh, S, M, K,) or, as As says, in one of the two<br>\
sides of the two nostrils, (S,) app. either for the<br>\
purpose of ornament or to render the animal<br>\
obedient; (MF;) [generally for the latter purpose, to attach the rein thereto:] when the ring<br>\
is of hair, it is termed خِزَامَةٌ; (As, S, Msb;)<br>\
and when of wood, خِشَاشٌ: (Msb:) Aboo-&#39; Alee<br>\
mentions, and explains in like manner, ↓ بَرْوَةٌ<br>\
and بُرًى; [the latter as pl. of the former;] but<br>\
this is extr.: (M:) J says, [in the S,] Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Alee says that بُرَةٌ is originally بَرْوَةٌ, because it<br>\
has بُرًى for a pl., like as قَرْيَة has قُرًى; but<br>\
Aboo-&#39; Alee does not say this; he only desires<br>\
to show that the final radical letter of بُرَةٌ is و<br>\
by the fact that بَرْوَةٌ is a dial. var. thereof: (IB,<br>\
TA:) some, however, remarking upon J&#39;s saying<br>\
that the original of بَرَةٌ is بَرْوَةٌ, assert that it is<br>\
correctly ↓ بُرْوَةٌ: (TA:) بُرَةٌ also signifies an<br>\
anklet: (M, K:) or any ring; such as a bracelet<br>\
and an earring and an anklet and the like of<br>\
these: (S:) the pl. (in the former and the latter<br>\
senses, M, TA) is بُرَاتٌ, (S, M, K,) in [some of]<br>\
the copies of the K erroneously written بُرَاةٌ, (TA,)<br>\
and بُرًى, (T, S, M,) and بُرُونَ, contr. to analogy,<br>\
(Msb,) or بُرِينَ (T, S, M, K, [in all of which,<br>\
except the last, this is in the accus. or the gen.<br>\
case, but, as it is the nom. case in the K, it may<br>\
be that بُرُونَ and بُرِينَ are dial. vars., like سِنُونَ<br>\
and سِنِينَ,]) and بُرِينَ. (M, K: [in a copy of the<br>\
former of which, accord. to the TT, بُرِىٌّ and بِرِىٌّ<br>\
are put in the place of the last two of these pls.])<br>\
بَرًا, or بَرًى, Dust, or earth: (Fr, S, M, Msb,<br>\
K, mentioned in the M and K in art. برى:)<br>\
whence بَرَاهُ, [if not originally بَرَأَهُ,] meaning “He<br>\
(i. e. God) created him.” (Fr, S.) Hence the<br>\
saying, بِفِيهِ البَرَا, or البَرَى, [In his mouth be<br>\
dust, or earth], (S, M,) a form of imprecation<br>\
against a man. (M.)<br>\
بَرْوَةٌ Cuttings, chips, parings, or the like, of a<br>\
reed for writing, and of a stick, or piece of wood,<br>\
and of soap, and the like. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also بُرَةٌ.<br>\
بُرْوَةٌ: see بُرَةٌ.<br>\
البَرِيَّةٌ The creation; as meaning the beings,<br>\
or things, that are created; or, particularly,<br>\
mankind; syn. الخَلْقُ: originally with ء: (S:)<br>\
but not pronounced with ء: (IAth, TA in art.<br>\
برى:) or, accord. to Fr, if from بَرًا, or بَرًى, i. e.<br>\
“dust,” or “earth,” it is originally without ء:<br>\
pl. بَرَايَا and بَرِيَّاتٌ. (S.)<br>\
مُبْرَاةٌ A she-camel (T, S) having a [ring such<br>\
as is termed] بُرَة put in her nose: (T, S, K:)<br>\
pl. مُبْرَيَاتٌ. (TA in art. عرف.)<br>\
بُرَةٌ مَبْرُوَّةٌ (T, M, K) A بُرَة made, or manufactured. (T, TA.)<br>\
