Q. 3<br>\

as is termed كَرْب,) became removed, or cleared<br>\
away. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It (the dawn) shone, or shone<br>\

بَلْقَعٌ and ↓ بَلْقَعَةٌ A land that is vacant, or<br>\
void; destitute of herbage or pasturage, and of<br>\
human beings, &amp;c.; (S, K;) in which is nothing:<br>\
(S:) or the former signifies a vacant, or void,<br>\
place: (Mgh:) [or instead of using the former<br>\
alone, you say أَرْضٌ بَلْقَعٌ; for] you say مَنْزِلٌ<br>\
بَلْقَعٌ [a vacant, or void, place of alighting or<br>\
abiding], (S, TA,) and دَارٌ بَلْقَعٌ [a vacant, or<br>\
void, house &amp;c.], without ة, when it is an epithet,<br>\
(S, TA,) applied to a mase. subst. and to a fem.;<br>\
(TA;) but if it be a subst., you say, اِنْتَهَيْنَا إِلَى<br>\
مَلْسَآءَ ↓ بَلْقَعَةٍ [we came at last to a smooth, vacant,<br>\
or void, land]: (S, TA:) and ↓ بَلْقَعَةٌ also signifies a land in which are no trees, either in sands<br>\
or in plain or level tracts: (TA:) or a vacant<br>\
land, in which is no one, whether there be in it<br>\
herbage or not, and whether plain or not: (Ham<br>\
p. 445:] pl. بَلَاقِعُ. (S, Mgh, K.) It is said in<br>\
a trad., اليَمِينُ الفَاجِرَةُ تَذَرُ (S, Mgh,<br>\
TA; but in the second and third of these, in the<br>\
place of تَذَرُ, we find تَدَعُ;) The false oath causes<br>\
the places of abode to become void, or vacant; i. e.,<br>\
by reason of its evil influence, the possessions and<br>\
their possessors perish; (Mgh;) or the [false]<br>\
swearer becomes poor, and the property that was<br>\
in his house goes away; (Sh;) or God renders<br>\
him in a state of disunion, and changes the blessings which He had conferred upon him: (TA:)<br>\
accord. to another relation, the words of the trad.<br>\
are اليَمِينُ الغَمُوسُ الخ. (Mgh.) You say also,<br>\
دِيَارٌ بَلْقَعٌ [Vacant, or void, places of abode]; as<br>\
though the places were one place: (TA:) and<br>\
Ru-beh says,<br>\
فَأَصْبَحَتْ دَارَهُمُ بَلَاقِعَا<br>\
[And their abode became vacant]: (TA:) and it<br>\
is said in a trad., أَصْبَحَتِ الأَرْضُ بَلَاقِعَ [as though<br>\
meaning the land became altogether vacant]; the<br>\
pl. being used to render the meaning intensive,<br>\
as in the phrases أَرْضٌ سَبَاسِبُ and ثَوْبٌ أَخْلَاقٌ;<br>\
(IAth, TA;) or because every portion thereof is<br>\
considered as being بلقع. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, without<br>\
ة and ↓ with ة, (tropical:)  A woman devoid of every good<br>\
quality. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  IF says that the ل in بَلْقَعٌ<br>\
is augmentative. (TA.)<br>\
بَلْقَعَةٌ: see بَلْقَعٌ, in four places.<br>\
بَلْقَعِىٌّ An arrow, or a spear-head, bright, or<br>\
free from rust, in the point. (K.)<br>\
صَلَنْقَعٌ بَلَنْقَعٌ is an expression applied to A road<br>\
[as though meaning made bare by the feet of men<br>\
and beasts]. (I &#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
