بَادَ, aor. يَبِيدُ, inf. n. بَيْدٌ (T, S, M, &amp;c.)<br>\
and بُيُودٌ (S, M, L, Msb, K) and بَيَادٌ (M, L, Msb,<br>\
K) and بَيْدُودَةٌ (Lh, M, L, K) and بَوَادٌ (L, K)<br>\
and بَوْدٌ, (CK,) the last but one disapproved<br>\
by MF, (TA,) [and the last equally doubtful,]<br>\
He, or it, perished; (T, S, A, Mgh, L, Msb;)<br>\
went away; passed away; became cut off, or<br>\
extinct; came to an end. (M, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بَادَتِ<br>\
الشَّمْسُ, inf. n. بُيُودٌ, The sun set. (Sb, M, K.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَبَادَهُمْ He (God) destroyed them; (T, S, A,<br>\
Mgh, * Msb;) caused them to go away, pass away,<br>\
become cut off or extinct, or come to an end.<br>\
(M. *)<br>\
بَيْدَ, (T, S, M, L, Mughnee, K,) as also ↓ بَايَدَ,<br>\
(L, K,) or بَائِدَ, (so in the Mughnee and in a<br>\
MS. copy of the K and in the CK, and in a MS.<br>\
copy of the K omitted,) a noun inseparably prefixed to أَنَّ with its complement, (Mughnee,) used<br>\
as syn. with غَيْر, (Ks, T, S, M, &amp;c.,) but never otherwise than in the accus. case, nor as an epithet, nor<br>\
otherwise than as an exceptive in a case in which<br>\
the thing excepted is disunited in kind from that<br>\
from which the exception is made. (Mughnee.)<br>\
You say, هُوَ كَثِيرُ المَالِ بَيْدَ أَنَّهُ بَخِيلٌ He is<br>\
possessed of abundant, or much, wealth, but he is<br>\
niggardly. (ISk, S, M, A, Msb, Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also as syn. with عَلَى, (M, K,) as some say;<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, M;) but to render it in the former<br>\
manner is preferable. (M.) Accord. to some,<br>\
(L,) it is syn. with عَلَى in the following trad.:<br>\
نَحْنُ الآخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ القيَامَةِ بَيْدَ أَنَّهُمْ أُوتُو<br>\
الكِتَابَ مِنْ قَبْلِنَا وَ أُوتِينَاهُ مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ [We, the<br>\
latter people, shall be those who will precede on<br>\
the day of resurrection, although they were given<br>\
the Scripture before us, and we were given it<br>\
after them]: (T, L:) El-Umawee holds it to be<br>\
so: (T:) but Ks says that it here signifies غَيْر<br>\
[as in the former ex.]: (T, L: [and so says IHsh<br>\
in the Mughnee:]) accord. to one recital, it is<br>\
بايَد; (L;) or بَائِدَ; so in the Musnad of the<br>\
Imám Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee: (Mughnee:) IAth says, I<br>\
have not found this in the classical language in<br>\
the sense of عَلَى: some say that it is بِأَيْدٍ, i. e.<br>\
by means of strength, or power; and that the<br>\
meaning is, we shall be those who will precede<br>\
to Paradise on the day of resurrection by means<br>\
of strength, or power, given us by God. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also, [accord. to some,] as meaning مِنْ أَجْلِ:<br>\
(L, Mughnee, K:) as in the saying of Mohammad, أَنَا أَفْصَحُ العَرَبِ بَيْدَ أَنِّى مِنْ قُرَيْشٍ وَنَشَأْتُ<br>\
فِى بَنِى سَعْدٍ [I am the most chaste in speech of<br>\
the Arabs because I am of the tribe of Kureysh<br>\
and I grew up among the children of Saad]:<br>\
(T, L: [in the Mughnee given somewhat differently:]) but Ibn-Málik and others say that it<br>\
here, also, means غير, after the manner in which<br>\
the latter is used in the saying [of a poet],<br>\
وَلَا عَيْبَ فِيهِمْ غَيْرَ أَنَّ سُيُوفَهُمْ<br>\
بِهِنَّ فُلُولٌ مِنْ قِرَاعِ الكَتَائِبِ<br>\
[And there is no blemish in them, save that their<br>\
swords have in them notches from the conflicting<br>\
of the troops]. (Mughnee.) This manner of<br>\
praising is termed by Abu-l-&#39;Abbás Mohammad<br>\
Ibn-Yezeed اِسْتِثْبَاتٌ. (Ham p. 474.) ―<br>\
-b4-  مَيْدَ is<br>\
also a dial. var. of the same. (A&#39;Obeyd, T,<br>\
Mughnee.)<br>\
بَيْدَآءُ A desert; or a waterless desert: (S, M, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K:) or one that is plain, or level, in<br>\
which horses are made to run: (M:) or one<br>\
wherein is nothing: (TA:) so called, accord. to<br>\
IJ, because it [often] destroys him who alights,<br>\
or sojourns, in it: (M, Msb: *) or a plain tract,<br>\
slightly elevated, with few trees, and without<br>\
herbage, extending to the distance of a day&#39;s<br>\
journey, or half a day&#39;s journey, or less, rugged<br>\
and hard, and only in a country of mould, or<br>\
clay: (ISh:) pl. بِيْدٌ: (S, M, Msb, K:) it has a<br>\
pl. of a form proper to epithets because it is originally an epithet: (M:) by rule it should be<br>\
بَيْدَاوَاتٌ. (M, K.)<br>\
بَيْدَانَةٌ A she-ass; a subst. applied to that<br>\
animal: (S:) or a wild she-ass: (M, K:) or one<br>\
that inhabits a desert (بَيْدَآء); (T, K;) [an epithet;] not a subst. applied to the animal; J being<br>\
in error in asserting it to be such: (K:) the<br>\
[wild] she-ass is thus called, accord. to most of<br>\
the lexicologists, because it inhabits the بيداء;<br>\
and if so, the ن is an augmentative letter: or,<br>\
accord. to some, because it is large in the body<br>\
(البَدَن); and if so, the ن is a radical letter:<br>\
(L:) the pl. is بَيْدَانَاتٌ. (L, K.)<br>\
بَايَدَ, or بَائِدَ: see بَيْدَ.<br>\
Quasi بير<br>\
بِيْرٌ; pl. of pauc. أَبْيَارٌ: see بِئْرٌ, in art. بأر.<br>\
