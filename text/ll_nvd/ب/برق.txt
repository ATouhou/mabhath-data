بَرُقَ, (S, Mgh,) inf. n.<br>\
بُرُوقٌ, (S,) or بَرِيقٌ, (Mgh, K,) or this is a simple<br>\
subst., (S,) and بَرْقٌ and بَرَقَانٌ (K, TA, but in<br>\
the CK بُرُوقٌ, as in the S,) It (a thing, Mgh, K,<br>\
a sword, &amp;c., S and the dawn, K, TA) shone,<br>\
gleamed, or glistened. (S, Mgh, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
said of a cloud, aor. as above, inf. n. بَرِيقٌ and<br>\
بَرْقً and بَرَقَانٌ, It gleamed or shone [with lightning]; and so ↓ ابرق, (JK,) and ↓ تبرّق. (K in<br>\

he was astonished or amazed or stupified, at seeing<br>\
the gleam of lightning: (TA voce بَحِرَ:) or his (a<br>\

looking at lightning. (Bd in lxxv. 7.) And hence,<br>\
(Bd ibid.,) بَرِقَ البَصَرُ, (S, Bd,) or بَصَرُهُ, (K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
بَرَقَ; (S, K;) and بَرَقَ, aor.<br>\
بَرُقَ; (K;) or the<br>\

lying and thy sin like the she-camel&#39;s raising of<br>\
her tail and feigning herself pregnant when she is<br>\

بَروَقٌ A certain kind of plant (JK, S) which<br>\
camels do not feed upon except in cases of necessity; (JK;) a small, feeble tree, which, when<br>\
the sky becomes clouded, grows green: (K:) n. un.<br>\
witIh ة: (S, K:) it was described by an Arab of<br>\
the desert to AHn as follows: a feeble, juicy<br>\
plant, having slender branches, at the heads of<br>\
which are small envelopes (قَمَاعِيلُ صِغَارٌ) like<br>\
chick-peas, in which is a kind of black grain: its<br>\
feebleness is such that it withers on the spot when<br>\
the sun becomes hot upon it: and nothing feeds<br>\
upon it; but men, when they are afflicted with<br>\
dearth, or drought, express from it a bitter juice,<br>\
then work it together, or knead it, with هَبِيد [or<br>\
colocynths, or the pulp, or seeds, thereof], or some<br>\
other thing, and eat it; but it is not eaten alone,<br>\
because it occasions excitement: it is one of the<br>\
plants that are plentiful in time of drought and<br>\
scarce in time of fruitfulness; when copious rain<br>\
falls upon it, it dies; and when we see it to have<br>\
become abundant, and coarse, or rough, we fear<br>\
drought: accord. to another of the Arabs of the<br>\
desert, the بَرْوَقَة is a bad kind of herb, or leguminous plant, that grows among the first of the herbs,<br>\
or leguminous plants: it has a reed like the سباط<br>\
[so I render لها قصبة مثل السباط, but I thing that the<br>\
right reading is, لَهَا قُضُبٌ مِثْلُ السِّيَاطِ it has twigs<br>\
like whips, agreeably with the description next<br>\
preceding, in which it is said to have slender<br>\
branches,] and a black fruit, or produce. (TA.)<br>\
Hence, أَشْكَرُ مِنْ بَرْوَقَةٍ [More grateful than a<br>\
barwakah]; (S, K;) because it grows green when<br>\
it sees the clouds, (S,) or by means of the least<br>\

which ↓ تَبَارِيقُ [pl. of ↓ تَبْروقٌ] is syn., (L, TA,)<br>\
applied to food (S, TA) in which is put a little<br>\
olive-oil or clarified butter: (S:) or ↓ تَبْروقٌ signifies the grease in a cooking-pot: and water<br>\
with a little olive-oil poured upon it: and ↓ تَبَارِيقُ<br>\
is its pl. (JK.)<br>\

بَرْوَاقٌ A certain plant also called خُنْثَى [i. e.<br>\
the asphodel, called by both these names in the<br>\
present day]: the eating of its fresh, juicy stalk,<br>\
boiled with olive-oil and vinegar, counteracts<br>\
jaundice; and the smearing with its root, or<br>\
lower part, removes the two kinds of بَهَق [q. v.].<br>\

-b3-  بَارِقَةٌ (tropical:)  Swords: (S, K, TA:) so called because<br>\
of their shining, or glistening: (TA:) pl. بَوَارِقُ;<br>\
(JK, Ham p. 306;) applied to swords and other<br>\
weapons. (Ham ubi suprà.) Hence the trad. of<br>\

now applied to borax, as is بورق alone, and مِلْحُ<br>\
الصَّاغَةِ], because it polishes silver well [or because of<br>\
its use in soldering]: the dust-coloured kind thereof<br>\
is called بورقُ الخَبَّازِينَ [the بورق of the bakers, or<br>\
makers of bread]: the نطرون is the red kind thereof:<br>\
and there is a kind thereof having an oily quality:<br>\
and a kind consisting of thin butyraceous fragments; and this, if light and hard, is the إِفْرِيقِى:<br>\
and the best thereof is that which is produced in<br>\
Egypt: (TA:) bruised, or powdered, the belly is<br>\
smeared with it, near to a fire, and it expels<br>\

strand: (JK:) and in like manner, (JK,) a<br>\

(K, TA,) black and white: (TA:) and (so in<br>\

he-goat and she-goat]: (S, K:) and شَاةٌ بَرْقَآءُ a<br>\
ewe whose white wool is cleft, or divided, by black<br>\

to beasts of the equine kind, and أَبْقَعُ and بَقْعَآءُ to<br>\
dogs. (Lh, TA.) ―<br>\

as is used for water to be poured on the hands;<br>\
each having a long and slender spout, and a<br>\
handle;] a well-known vessel; (TA;) a vessel<br>\
having a spout (Mgh, and Bd and Jel in lvi. 18)<br>\
and a handle: (Bd and Jel ibid:) accord. to Kr,<br>\
a كُوز; and so says AHn in one place; but in<br>\
another he says that it is like a كوز: (TA:) [it<br>\
is somewhat like a كوز with the addition of a<br>\
spout:] pl. أَبَارِيقُ (S, Msb) [and sometimes<br>\
أَبَارِقَةٌ].<br>\

sword: or, as some say, a bow: (JK:) or it<br>\
signifies also a bow in which are تَلَامِيع [or places<br>\
differing in colour from the rest, and, app., glistening]: (K:) thus, accord. to Az, in a verse of<br>\
&#39; Amr Ibn-Ahmar: but correctly, accord. to Sgh,<br>\
it has there the first of the significations explained<br>\
in this sentence: and it is said, also, that سَيْفٌ إِبْرِيقٌ<br>\
signifies a sword having much lustre, and much<br>\
diversified with wavy marks or streaks, or in its<br>\
grain. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A woman who is beautiful, and<br>\

أُبَيْرِقٌ dim. of إِسْتَبْرَقٌ, q. v. (S, K.)<br>\
إِسْتَبْرَقٌ, (IDrd, S, K, &amp;c.,] sometimes with the<br>\

thong cut from an untanned skin (قِدَّةٌ حَمْرَآءُ), as<br>\
though it were [composed of] pieces of bow-strings,<br>\
or chords: (Ibn-&#39; Abbád, K:) it is an arabicized<br>\
word, (IDrd, S, K,) form إِسْتَرْوَهٌ, (IDrd, K,)<br>\
which is Syriac; (IDrd, TA;) or from the Persian, (S, TA,) in which سِتَبْر and إِسْتَبْر signify<br>\
“ thick,” absolutely, whence سِتَبْرَهْ and إِسْتَبْرَهْ are<br>\
particularly applied to signify “ thick ديباج, and<br>\
then the latter is arabicized by substituting ق for<br>\
the ه: so says Esh-Shiháb El-Khafájee: or the ا<br>\
and س and ت are augmentative, and it is mentioned in the present art. in the S and K as<br>\
though this were the case, agreeably with the<br>\
form of its dim., which is said by J and in the K<br>\
to be ↓ أُبَيْرِقٌ; for in forming the dim., a word is<br>\
reduced to its root. (TA.)<br>\
