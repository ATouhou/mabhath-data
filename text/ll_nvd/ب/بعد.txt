off, or aloof: he went, or removed, or retired, or<br>\
withdrew himself, to a distance, or far away,<br>\
or far off: he alienated, or estranged, himself:<br>\

[but بَعُدَ generally has the first of these significations; and ↓ ابعد, the others, as also ↓ تباعد<br>\
and ↓ استبعد:] it is the general opinion of the<br>\
leading lexicologists that بَعِدَ, as well as بَعُدَ, is<br>\
thus used; but some deny this; and some assert<br>\
that they may be employed alike, but that بَعُدَ is<br>\
more chaste than بَعِدَ thus used. (TA.) [You<br>\
say also, of a desert, and a tract of country, and<br>\
the like, بَعُدَ, meaning It extended far.] And<br>\
زَيْدٌ عَنِ المَنْزِلِ ↓ ابعد, meaning ↓ تباعد [i. e. Zeyd<br>\
went, or removed, to a distance, or far, from the<br>\
place of alighting or abode]. (IKt, Msb.) And<br>\
مِنِّى ↓ تباعد, and ↓ ابتعد, and ↓ تبعّد, [He went, or<br>\
removed, to a distance, or far, from me; he alienated, or estranged, himself from me; he shunned,<br>\
or avoided, me;] (A;) and عَنِّى ↓ تباعد [and بَعُدَ<br>\
عنّى signify the same]. (Msb in art. كشح.)<br>\
And ↓ إِذَا أَرَاذَ أَحَدُكُمْ الحَاجَةِ أَبْعَدَ, (L, Msb,)<br>\
a trad., (Msb,) meaning When one of you desires<br>\
to accomplish that which is needful, (i. e. to ease<br>\
nature,) he goes far, or to a great distance. (L.)<br>\
And فِى المَذْهَبِ ↓ أَبْعَدْتُ, meaning ↓ تَبَاعَدْتُ,<br>\
(Msb,) I went far, or to a great distance, to the<br>\
place of ease, i. e., to ease nature. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [بَعُدَ<br>\
referring to a saying or the like, and an event,<br>\
means It was far from being probable or correct;<br>\
it was improbable, extraordinary, or strange:<br>\
(see بَعِيدٌ, and see also 10:) often occurring in<br>\
these senses.] And فِى نَوْعِهِ ↓ ابعد It reached the<br>\
utmost point, or degree, in its kind, or species.<br>\
(IAth.) And ابعد فِى السَّوْمِ He exceeded the<br>\
due bounds in offering a thing for sale and demanding a price for it, or in bargaining for a<br>\
thing. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَخَذَهُ مَا قَرُبَ وَ مَا بَعُدَ Recent and<br>\
old griefs took hold upon him: a saying similar<br>\
to أَخَذَهُ مَا قَدُمَ وَ مَا حَدُثَ. (Mgh in art. قدم.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  [بَعُدَ is often used, agreeably with a general<br>\
rule, in the manner of a verb of praise or dispraise;<br>\
and in this case is commonly contracted into بُعْدَ,<br>\
like حُسْنَ; as in the phrase, in a verse of Imrael-Keys, بُعْدَ مَا مُتَأَمَّلى (in which ما is redundant)<br>\
Distant, or far distant, was the object of my<br>\
contemplation! or (as explained in the EM p. 52)<br>\
how distant, &amp;c.!] ―<br>\

بَعُدَ, inf. n. بُعْدٌ; (L,<br>\
K;) also signify He, or it, perished: (S L, Msb:)<br>\
he died: (K:) it is the general opinion of the<br>\
leading lexicologists that both these verbs are<br>\
used as signifying “he perished,” and both occur<br>\
in different readings of v. 98 of ch. xi. of the Kur:<br>\
the former is said to be used in this sense by some<br>\
of the Arabs; and the latter, by others; but some<br>\
disallow the latter in this sense; and some say<br>\
that the former is more chaste than the latter thus<br>\
used: (TA:) or both signify he became far distant<br>\
from his home or native country; became a<br>\
stranger, or estranged, therefrom: (L, TA:) or<br>\
the Arabs say, بَعِدَ الرَّجُلُ and بَعُدَ in the sense of<br>\
تباعد, when not reviling; but when reviling, they<br>\
say, بَعِدَ, only. (Yoo, TA.) You say, لَا تَبْعَدٌ<br>\
وَ إِنْ بَعُدْتَ عَنَّى [Mayest thou not perish though<br>\
thou be distant from me!] (A.) [And as an<br>\
imprecation against a man, you say, بَعِدْتَ, meaning Mayest thou perish! (See the printed edition<br>\
of the Ham, pp. 89 and 90, where بَعِدْتَاىَ هلكت<br>\
is an evident mistake for َعِدْتَ أَى هَلَكْتَ.)] And<br>\
بُعْدًا لَهُ May God alienate him, or estrange<br>\
him, from good, or prosperity! or, curse him!<br>\
(A, * K, TA;) i. e. may he not be pitied with<br>\
respect to that which has befallen him! like<br>\
سُحْقًا لَهُ: the most approved way being to put<br>\
بعد thus in the accus. case as an inf. n.; but<br>\
the tribe of Temeem say, لَهُ ↓ بُعْدٌ, and سُحْقٌ, like<br>\
غُلَامٌ لَهُ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  بَعُدَ is made trans. by means<br>\
of [the preposition] ب: see 4. (Msb.)<br>\
2<br>\
بَعَّدَ see 4, in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [You say also,<br>\
بعّدهُ عَنِ السُّوْءِ He declared him, or pronounced<br>\
him, to be far removed from evil.]<br>\

distance, or he put, or sent, away, or far away,<br>\
or far off, or he removed far away, alienated,<br>\
or estranged, him, or it. (S, Msb.) You say,<br>\
نَفْسَكَ عَنْ زَيْدٍ ↓ بَاعِدْ [Remove thyself far from;<br>\
or avoid thou, Zeyd]: and زَيْدًا عَنْكَ ↓ بَاعِدْ<br>\
[Remove thou Zeyd far from thee]. (TA, voce<br>\
إِيَّا.) And بَيْنَهُمَا ↓ بَعَّدْتُ, inf. n. تَبْعِيدٌ, [I made<br>\
a wide separation between them two]; as also<br>\
↓ بَاعَدْتُ, inf. n. مُبَاعَدَةٌ. (Msb.) And اللّٰهُ ↓ بَاعَدَ<br>\

two far extending! may He make a wide separation between them two!]; as also ↓ بَعَّدَ. (TA.)<br>\
And بَيْنَ أَسْفَارِنَا ↓ رَبَّنَا بَاعِدْ, or ↓ بَعِّدْ, [O our<br>\
Lord, make to be far-extending the spaces between<br>\
our journeys! or, put wide distances between our<br>\
journeys!] accord. to different readings [in the<br>\
Kur xxxiv. 18]: the former of these is the common<br>\
reading: Yaakoob El-Hadramee read ↓ رَبُّنَا بَاعَدَ<br>\
الخ [Our Lord, He hath made to be far extending &amp;c.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَبْعَدَهُ اللّٰهُ means May God<br>\
alienate him, or estrange him, from good, or<br>\
prosperity! or, curse him! (K;) i. e., may he<br>\
not be pitied with respect to that which has befallen him! (TA.) [You say also, أَبْعَدَ اللّٰهُ الأَخِرَ:<br>\
see أَخِرٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 10.<br>\
-A3-  مَا أَبْعَدَهُ مِنَ الصَّوَابِ<br>\

تباعد: see 1, in six places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [It also signifies He became alienated, or estranged, from his<br>\
family or friends. ―<br>\
-b3-  And تباعدوا They became<br>\
distant, or remote, one from another; they went,<br>\
removed, retired, or withdrew themselves, to a<br>\
distance, far away, or far off, one from another;<br>\
they removed themselves far, or kept aloof, one<br>\
from another.] You say, كَانُوا مُتَقَارِبِينَ فَتَبَاعَدُوا<br>\
[They were near, one to another, and they became<br>\
distant, or remote, one from another]. (A.)<br>\

إِبْتَعَدَ see 1.<br>\
10<br>\
استبعدهُ He reckoned it, or esteemed it,<br>\
(namely, a thing, K, or a saying, A,) بَعِيد [i. e.<br>\
distant, or remote; or if a saying or the like,<br>\
far from being probable or correct, improbable,<br>\
extraordinary, or strange]; (S, A, K;) as also<br>\
↓ ابعدهُ. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, first sentence, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
بَعْدُ an adv. n. of time, signifying After, or<br>\
afterwards: and allowable also, accord. to some<br>\
of the grammarians, as an adv. n. of place, signifying after, or behind: (TA:) contr. of قَبْلُ:<br>\
(S, A, K:) it is a vague adv. n., of which the<br>\
meaning is not understood without its being prefixed to another noun [expressed or implied]; denoting after-time. (Msb.) When it occurs without any complement, (S, K,) a noun or the like<br>\
which should be its complement being intended<br>\
to be understood as to the meaning thereof but<br>\
not as to the letter, (S, * TA,) it is indecl., (S,<br>\
K,) because it resembles a particle, (TA,) and<br>\
has damm for its termination to show that it is<br>\
indecl., since it cannot have damm by any rule<br>\
of desinential syntax because it cannot occur as<br>\
an agent nor as an inchoative or enunciative.<br>\
(S.) Sb, however, mentions [as exceptions to<br>\
this rule] the phrases مِنْ بَعْدٍ [Afterwards] and<br>\
أَفْعَلُ هٰذَا بَعْدًا [I will do this afterwards], as<br>\
having been used by the Arabs. (K, * TA.) [The<br>\
latter of these phrases is common in the present<br>\
day. Another exception to the rule above-mentioned will be found in what follows.] Accord.<br>\
to the primary rule, it is used as a prefixed n.<br>\
governing its complement in the gen. case; (S;)<br>\
[i. e., it is used in the manner of a preposition;]<br>\
and when thus used, it is decl., (K,) because it<br>\
does not in this case [always] resemble a particle.<br>\
(TA.) You say, جَآءَ زَيْدٌ بَعْدَ عَمْرٍو Zeyd came<br>\
after &#39;Amr. (Msb.) And رَأَيْتُهُ بَعْدَكَ and مِنْ<br>\
بَعْدِكَ [I saw him after thee]. (L.) The words<br>\
of the Kur [xxx. 3], اللّٰهِ الْأَمْرُ مِنْ قَبْلُ وَ مِنْ بَعْدُ,<br>\
meaning To God belonged the command before<br>\
that the Greeks were overcome and after that<br>\
they had been overcome, [thus read when the<br>\
complements of قبل and بعد are intended to be<br>\
understood as to the meaning thereof but not as<br>\
to the letter,] are also read مِنْ قَبْلِ وَ مِنْ بَعْدِ,<br>\
when each complement is intended to be understood as to the meaning and the letter, and also<br>\
مِنْ قَبْلٍ وَ مِنْ بَعْدٍ, meaning To God belongeth the<br>\
command first and last, [when neither complement<br>\
is intended to be understood either as to the letter or<br>\
as to the meaning,] but the first of these readings<br>\
is the best. (L.) [You say also, بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ and مِنْ<br>\
بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ After that: and بَعْدَ أَنْ فَعَلْتُ and مِنْ<br>\
بَعْدِ أَنْ فَعَلْتُ and بَعْدَ مَا فَعَلْتُ and مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا<br>\
فَعَلْتُ After I did, or after my doing, such<br>\
a thing: &amp;c.] Also جِئْتُ بَعْدَيْكُمَا, meaning<br>\
بَعْدَ كُمَا, I came after you two. (K.) And هٰذَا مِمَّا<br>\
لَيْسَ بَعْدَهُ غَايَةٌ فِى الجَوْدَةِ, and فِى الرَّدَآءَة, This is<br>\
of the things after, or beyond, which there is not<br>\
any extreme degree in respect of goodness, and<br>\
in respect of badness: and, by way of abridgement, لَيْسَ بَعْدَهُ [with nothing following this]:<br>\
and hence, app., the saying of Mohammad, وَإِنْ<br>\
كَانَ لَيْسَ بِالَّذِى لَا بَعْدَ لَهُ, meaning [And though]<br>\
it be not in the utmost degree in respect of goodness: بعد being thus used as a decl. noun. (Mgh.)<br>\
[<br>\
بَعْدِى and the like are also frequently used as<br>\
meaning بَعْدَ عَهْدِى and the like; as in the<br>\
phrase, قَدْ تَغَيَّرْتَ بَعْدى Thou hast become altered<br>\
since I knew thee, or saw thee, or met thee, or<br>\
was with thee. And similar to this are many<br>\
phrases in the Kur; as, for instance, in ii. 48,]<br>\
ثُمَّ اتَّخَذْتُمُ العِجْلَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ Then ye took to<br>\
yourselves the calf as a god, or an object of worship, after him, namely Moses, i. e., after his<br>\
having gone away. (Bd.) أَمَّا بَعْدُ (S, K, &amp;c.) is<br>\
[an expression denoting transition;] an expression by which an address or a discourse is divided;<br>\
(S;) used without any complement to بعد,<br>\
which in this case signifies the contr. of قَبْلُ:<br>\
(TA:) you say, أَمَّا بَعْدُ فَقَدْ كَانَ كَذَا, meaning<br>\
[Now, after these preliminary words, (Abu-l-<br>\
&#39;Abbás in TA voce خِطَابٌ,) I proceed to say,<br>\
that such a thing has happened: or] after my<br>\
prayer for thee: (K:) or after praising God:<br>\
(TA:) the first who used this formula was David;<br>\
(K;) or Jacob; (TA;) or Kaab Ibn-Lu-eí; (K;)<br>\
or Kuss Ibn-Sá&#39;ideh; or Yaarub Ibn-Kahtán.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You also use the dim. form, saying<br>\
↓ بُعَيْدَهُ [A little after him, or it], when you<br>\
mean by it to denote a time near to the preceding<br>\
time. (Msb.) You say also, بَيْنٍ ↓ رَأَيْتُهُ بُعَيْدَاتِ,<br>\
(S, K,) and ↓ بَعِيدَاتِهِ, (K, TA, [in the CK<br>\
بُعَيْدَاتِه,]) I saw him a little after a separation:<br>\
(S, K:) or, after intervals of separation: (S, L:)<br>\
or, after a while. (A&#39;Obeyd, A.) And إِنَّهَا لَتَضْحَكُ<br>\
بَيْنٍ ↓ بُعَيْذَاتِ Verily she laughs after intervals.<br>\
(L.) [See also art. بين.] ↓ بُعَيْدَات is used only as<br>\
an adv. n. of time. (S, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  بَعْدُ also sometimes<br>\
means Now; yet; as yet. (TA.) [It is used<br>\
in this sense mostly in negative phrases; as, for<br>\
instance, in لَمْ يَمُتْ بَعْدُ He has not died yet.<br>\
The following is one of the instances of its having<br>\
this meaning in affirmative phrases: سُمِّيَ الحَوْلِىُّ<br>\
مِنْ أَوْلَادِ البَقَرِ تَبِيعًا لِأَنَّهُ يَنْبَعُ أُمَّهُ بَعْدُ The yearling<br>\
of the offspring of cows is called تبيع because he<br>\
yet follows his mother: occurring in the Mgh<br>\
&amp;c., in art. تبع.] ―<br>\
-b4-  It occurs also in the sense<br>\
of مَعَ; as in the words of the Kur [ii. 174 and<br>\
v. 95], فَمَنِ اعْتَدَى بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ, i. e., (as some say,<br>\
MF,) مَعَ ذلك [And whoso transgresseth notwithstanding that; lit., with that]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  It has<br>\
been said that it also means Before, in time;<br>\
thus bearing two contr. significations: that it has<br>\
this meaning in two instances; in the Kur<br>\
[lxxix. 30], where it is said, وَ الْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ<br>\
دَحَاهَا [as though signifying And the earth, before<br>\
that, He spread it forth]; and [xxi. 105] where<br>\
it is said, وَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِى الزَّبُورِ مِنْ بَعْدِ الذِّكْرِ<br>\
[as though meaning And verily we wrote in the<br>\
Psalms before the Kur-án]: (MF, TA:) but Az<br>\
says that this is a mistake; that God created the<br>\
earth not spread forth; then created the heaven;<br>\
and then spread forth the earth: (L, TA:) and<br>\
الذكر in the latter of these instances means the<br>\
Book of the Law revealed to Moses: (Bd:) or<br>\
الزبور means the revealed Scriptures; (Bd, Jel;)<br>\
and الذكر, the Preserved Tablet, (Bd,) [i. e.]<br>\
the Original of the Scriptures, which is with<br>\
God. (Jel.)<br>\
بُعْدٌ [as an inf. n. used in the manner of a<br>\
subst. signifies] Distance, or remoteness; (S, A,<br>\
L, K; *) and so ↓ بَعَدٌ, (L, K,) accord. to most<br>\
of the leading lexicologists, (TA, [see بَعْدَ,]) [and<br>\
↓ بُعْدَةٌ, for] you say, بَيْنَنَا بُعْدَةٌ, meaning [Between<br>\
us two is a distance] of land or country, or of<br>\
relationship. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Remoteness from probability or correctness; improbability, or strangeness: see بَعُدَ. Hence the phrase, هٰذَا مِنَ البُعْدِ<br>\
بِمَكَانٍ This is improbable, or extraordinary, or<br>\
strange: often occurring in the TA &amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
i. q. ↓ بُعْدٌ: (L, K:) this latter (S, L, Msb, K)<br>\
and بُعْدٌ, (L, K,) accord. to most of the leading<br>\
lexicologists, as, for instance, in the Kur xi. 98,<br>\
(TA, [see بَعِدَ,]) signifying Perdition; (S, L,<br>\
Msb;) or death. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Judgment and prudence; as also ↓ بُعْدَةٌ: so in the phrase, إِنَّهُ لَذُو<br>\
بُعْدٍ, and بُعْدَةٍ, Verily he is possessed of judgment<br>\
and prudence: (K:) or penetrating, or effective,<br>\
judgment; depth, or profundity; far-reaching<br>\
judgment. (TA.) [See also أَبْعَدُ.] ↓ ذُو البُعْدَةِ<br>\
also signifies A man who goes to a great length,<br>\
or far, in hostility. (L.) ―<br>\
-b5-  A cursing; execration; malediction; as also ↓ بِعَادٌ. (K.) You<br>\
say, بُعْدٌ لَهُ, as well as بُعْدًا لَهُ: see 1, last sentence<br>\
but one. (TA.)<br>\
بَعَدٌ: see بُعْدٌ, in two places:<br>\
-A2-  and بَعِيدٌ, in<br>\
five places.<br>\
بُعْدٌ: see أَبْعَدُ, in two places.<br>\
بُعْدَةٌ: see بُعْدٌ, in three places.<br>\
بُعَادٌ: see بَعِيدٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also بَاعِدٌ.<br>\
بِعَادٌ: see بُعْدٌ.<br>\
بَعِيدٌ Distant; remote; far; far off; (S, L,<br>\
K; *) as also ↓ بُعَادٌ, and ↓ بَاعِدٌ: (L, K:) pl. (of<br>\
the first, S, L) بُعْدَانٌ (S, L, K) and (of the first<br>\
also, L, TA) بُعُدٌ (L, K) and بِعَادٌ (TA) and (of<br>\
the first and second, L) بُعَدَآءُ (L, K) and of the<br>\
third, ↓ بَعَدٌ, [but this (which is also used as a sing.<br>\
epithet, as will be shown in what follows,) is<br>\
properly a quasi-pl. n.,] like as خَدَمٌ is of خَادِمٌ.<br>\
(S.) As signifying Distant with respect to place,<br>\
it is correctly used alike as masc. and fem. and<br>\
sing. and dual and pl.; (L, and TA in this art.<br>\
and in art. قرب, in which latter see the authorities;) but not necessarily; like its contr. قَرِيبٌ:<br>\
(L:) you say, هِىَ بَعِيدٌ مِنْكَ [She is distant from<br>\
thee; or it is] as though you said, مَكَانُهَا بَعِيدٌ:<br>\
(L:) also مَا أَنْتَ مِنَّا بِبَعِيدٍ [Thou art not distant<br>\
from us ], and مَا أَنْتُمْ مِنَّا بِبَعِيدٍ [Ye are not<br>\
distant from us]: and in like manner, مَا أَنْتَ<br>\
↓ مِنَّا بِبَعَدٍ, and ↓ مَا أَنْتُمُ مِنَّا بِبَعَدٍ. (S, TA.)<br>\
[But it receives, sometimes, the fem. form when<br>\
used in this sense; for] جَلَسْتُ بَعِيدًا مِنْكَ and<br>\
بَعِيدَةٌ مِنْكَ are phrases mentioned as signifying<br>\
I sat distant, or remote in place, or at a distance,<br>\
or aloof, from thee; مَكَانًا [and نَاحِيَةً or the like]<br>\
being understood. (L.) You say also, ↓ مَنْزِلٌ بَعَدٌ<br>\
A distant, or remote, place of alighting or abode.<br>\
(K.) And تَنَحَّ غَيْرَ بَعِيدٍ (S, K) and ↓ غَيْرَ بَاعِدٍ<br>\
and ↓ غَيْرَ بَعَدٍ (K) [Retire thou not far;] meaning be thou near: (S, K:) [or] the second and<br>\
third of these phrases mean retire thou not in<br>\
an abject, or a mean, or contemptible, or despicable, state. (S, A.) And ↓ اِنْطَلِقْ يَا فُلَانُ غَيْرَ بَاعِدٍ<br>\
[Depart thou, O such a one, not far;] meaning<br>\
mayest thou not go away! (L.) [And رَأَيْتُهُ مِنْ<br>\
بَعِيدٍ I saw him, or it, from afar: and جَآءَ مِنْ<br>\
بَعِيدٍ He came from afar: and the like. And<br>\
بَعِيدٌ as applied to a desert and the like, meaning<br>\
Far extending.] And ↓ بُعْدٌ بَاعِدٌ A far distance.<br>\
(K.) [And نِيَّةٌ بَعِيدَةٌ A distant, far-reaching, or<br>\
far-aiming, intention, purpose, or design.] And<br>\
فُلَانٌ بَعِيدُ الهِمَّةِ [Such a one is far-aiming, or faraspiring, in purpose, desire, or ambition]. (A.)<br>\
And هِىَ بَعِيدَةُ العَهْدِ [She was known, or seen, or<br>\
met, a long time ago]: in this case, the fem.<br>\
form, with ة, must be used. (L.) And قَوْلٌ بَعِيدٌ<br>\
[A saying far from being probable or correct; improbable; far-fetched; extraordinary, or strange].<br>\
(A.) And أَمْرٌ بَعِيدٌ An extraordinary thing or<br>\
affair or case, of which the like does not happen<br>\
or occur. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Distant with respect to<br>\
kindred or relationship: in which sense, the word<br>\
receives the fem. form, [as well as the dual form,<br>\
and pl. forms, like its contr. قَرِيبٌ,] by universal<br>\

الأَمِيرِ فَكُنْ مِنْ بُعْدَانِهِ [If thou be not of the particular companions, or familiars, of the governor,<br>\
or prince, then be of his distant dependents, or<br>\
subjects]; i. e., be distant from him, that his evil<br>\
may not affect thee. (AZ, A.) ―<br>\

بَاعِدُ: see بَعِيدٌ in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Perishing: (S, L: [in the K it is implied that it signifies<br>\
dying; and so ↓ بَعِيدٌ and ↓ بُعَادٌ:]) or far distant<br>\

estrangement therefrom. (L.)<br>\
أَبْعَدُ More, and most, distant or remote; further, and furthest: by poetic licence written أَبْعَدُّ:<br>\
(L:) [pl. أَبَاعِدُ; as in the saying,] فُلَانٌ يَسْتَجِرُّ<br>\
الحَدِيثَ مِنْ أَبَاعِدِ أَطْرَافِهِ [Such a one draws forth<br>\
talk, or discourse, or news, or the like, from its<br>\
most remote sources]. (A.) ―<br>\

no good in him: (K:) or, no depth in him in<br>\

in his kind: see also بُعْدٌ:] said in dispraising one.<br>\

what is extraordinary in its kind: or] he possesses<br>\
not excellence, or power, or riches: or he possesses<br>\
not anything profitable: (L, K:) said only in<br>\
dispraising one: (AZ:) or it may mean he possesses not anything which one would go far to<br>\
seek; or, anything of value: or what he possesses,<br>\
of things or qualities that are desirable, is more<br>\
extraordinary than what others possess. (MF.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Remote from good: [which is the meaning<br>\
generally intended in the present day when it is<br>\
used absolutely as an epithet applied to a man;<br>\
but meaning also remote from him or those in<br>\
whose presence this epithet is used, both as to<br>\
place and as to moral condition:] and, from<br>\
continence: (L:) and stupid; foolish; or having<br>\
little, or no, intellect or understanding; syn. حَائِنٌ:<br>\
(so in a copy of the S and in the L and TA:) or<br>\
treacherous, or unfaithful; syn. خَائِنٌ (So in<br>\
two copies of the S and in a copy of the A.) It is<br>\
used as an allusion to the name of a person whom<br>\
one would mention with dispraise; as when one<br>\
says, هَلَكَ الأَبْعَدُ [May such a one, the remote<br>\
from good, &amp;c., perish!]: with respect to a woman,<br>\
one says, هَلَكَتِ البُعْدَى. (En-Nadr, Az.) One<br>\
says also, كَبَّ اللّٰهُ الأَبْعَدَ لِفِيهِ, meaning [May<br>\
God cast down prostrate such a one, the remote<br>\
from good, &amp;c., upon his mouth! or,] cast him<br>\
down upon his face! (S.) [It is a rule observed<br>\
in decent society, by the Arabs, to avoid, as much<br>\
as possible, the mention of opprobrious epithets,<br>\
lest any person present should imagine an epithet<br>\
of this kind to be slily applied to himself: therefore, when any malediction or vituperation is<br>\
uttered, it is usual to allude to the object by the<br>\
term الأَبْعَد, or البَعِيد, as meaning the remote<br>\
from good, &amp;c., and also the remote from the<br>\
person or persons present. See also الأَخِرُ, which<br>\
is used in a similar manner.] ―<br>\
