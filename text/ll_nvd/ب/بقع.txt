أَصَابَهُ خُرْءُ بَقَاعِ, like قَطَامِ, [indecl.,] and decl.,<br>\
(K,) and imperfectly decl., so that you say also<br>\
بَقَاعٍ, and بَقَاعَ, (AZ, TA,) Dust and sweat came<br>\
upon him, and discolorations produced thereby<br>\

one that is cautious, or wary, cunning, or wily,<br>\
and skilful: (TA:) (tropical:)  a man possessing much cunning: (K, TA:) [accord. to some] so called<br>\
because he alights and abides in [various] parts<br>\
(بِقَاع) of the earth, and often traverses countries,<br>\
and possesses much knowledge thereof: to such,<br>\
therefore, is likened (tropical:)  a man knowing, or skilful,<br>\
in affairs, who investigates them much, and is<br>\
experienced therein; the ة being added to give<br>\
intensiveness to the signification: (TA:) and<br>\
(tropical:)  sharp, or quick, in intellect; knowing; whom<br>\
nothing escapes, and who is not to be deceived,<br>\
beguiled, or circumvented: (K, TA:) pl. بَوَاقِعُ.<br>\

the very cunning. (TA.) ―<br>\

TA;) and so applied to a dog: (Lh, TA voce<br>\
أَبْرَقُ, q. v.:) or, applied to the former, having whiteness in the breast; and this is the worst [or most<br>\
ill-omened] of the crow-kind: (TA:) [it is this<br>\
species, accord. to some, which is called غُرَابُ<br>\
البَيْنِ: (see art. بين:)] or, applied to a غراب &amp;c.,<br>\
party-coloured, or pied: (Msb:) or the whitewinged غراب: (ISh, TA in art. حذف:) pl., when<br>\
thus applied, بُقْعَانٌ, (TA,) or بِقْعَانٌ, with kesr;<br>\
the quality of a subst. being predominant in it;<br>\
but when it is regarded as an epithet, [in which<br>\
case the fem. is بَقْعَآءُ,] its pl. is بُقْعٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, as being likened to such a bird, (tropical:)  Anything<br>\
bad, evil, wicked, mischievous, [ill-omened,] or the<br>\

are of the Greeks and the Negroes: (S, K:) or<br>\
so called because of the mixture of their colours;<br>\
their predominant colours being white and yellow:<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd says that what is meant is whiteness<br>\
and yellowness, and they are thus called because<br>\
of their difference of colours and their being begotten of two races: but Kt says, البُقْعَانُ signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  those in whom is blackness and whiteness; and<br>\
one who is white without any admixture of blackness is not called ابقع: how then should the<br>\
Greeks be called بقعان when they are purely<br>\
white? and he adds that he thinks the meaning<br>\
to be, the offspring of Arabs, who are black,<br>\
[which is not to be understood literally, but rather<br>\
in the sense of swarthy,] by female slaves of the<br>\
Greeks, who are white. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بُقْعٌ is also<br>\
applied to Waterers (سُقَاةٌ); because their bodies<br>\

boy&#39;s mustache. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And said of a camel&#39;s<br>\
tush, (tropical:)  It cut, or came forth. (ISk, S, TA.) ―<br>\

the sing. and pl. are alike, (El-Ahmar, K,) [and<br>\
if so, the word may be fem., as Ibn-Buzurj, cited<br>\

فُولٌ [Beans; or the bean; faba sativa of Jussieu;<br>\
vicia faba of Linnæus]; (JK, K;) a name of the<br>\
dial. of the Sawád [of El-&#39;Irák]; its produce is<br>\
called الجِرْجِرُ; (TA; [but see جَرْجِيرٌ; and see<br>\
تُرْمُسٌ;]) [or it is applied to the plant and to its<br>\
produce;] a certain well-known حَبّ [or grain]:<br>\
(Mgh:) the eating of it produces exhalations (K)<br>\
of a gross kind, (TA,) and bad dreams, and سَدَر,<br>\
(K,) i. e. vertigo, (TA,) and anxiety, and gross<br>\
humours; but it is good for the cough, and for<br>\
rendering the body fruitful (تَخْصِيب البَدَن);<br>\
when properly qualified [app. by seasoning or<br>\
by some admixture] (إِذَا أُصْلِحَ), it preserves the<br>\
health; and in its green state, together with ginger,<br>\
it has the utmost effect in strengthening the venereal faculty: (K:) the pl. is بَوَاقِلُ: and the<br>\
dim. of باقّلى is ↓ بُوَيْقِلَةٌ and ↓ بُوَيْقِلْيَةٌ, the latter<br>\
with the ل quiescent because kesreh is disapproved<br>\
in so long a word; [both forms indicating that<br>\
باقلّى is held to be fem.;] and that of باقلآء is<br>\
بُوَيْقِلَآء [with or without tenween accord. as it is<br>\
held to be masc. or fem.], or, if one will, he<br>\
[who holds باقلآء to be fem.] may say ↓ بُوَيْقلَةٌ,<br>\
suppressing the augmentative meddeh, and adding<br>\
ة to indicate the fem. gender; and that of باقلّاة<br>\
is ↓ بُوَيْقِلَاةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  البَاقِلَّى القبْطِىُّ [app. the<br>\

تُرْمُسٌ, &amp;c., i. e. The Egyptian bean; an appellation said to be applied by some in the present<br>\
day to the colocasia; but what it properly denotes<br>\
is doubtful;] a certain plant, the grain of which<br>\
is smaller than the فُول [or bean]: (K:) the<br>\
people of Egypt know it by the name of الجَامِسَة,<br>\
with جيم, and with the unpointed سين: he who<br>\
says that it is the تُرْمُس is in error. (Ibn-Beytár,<br>\
