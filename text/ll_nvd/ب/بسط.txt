بَسُطَ, (M, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
بَسْطٌ, (S, M, Msb,) contr. of تَبْسيِطٌ; (M, TA;) as<br>\
also ↓بسّطهُ, (M,* TA,) inf. n. تَبْسيِطٌ. (TA.) [As<br>\
such,] He spread it; spread it out, or forth;<br>\
expanded it; extended it; (S, Msb, K, B;) as<br>\
also ↓بسّطهُ: (K:) and he made it wide, or<br>\
ample: these are the primary significations; and<br>\
sometimes both of them may be conceived; and<br>\
sometimes, one of them: and the verb is also<br>\
used, metaphorically, as relating to anything<br>\
which cannot be conceived as composed or constructed: (B:) and بَصْطٌ is the same as بَسْطٌ, (S,<br>\
and K in art. بصط,) in all its meanings. (K.)<br>\
You say, بَسَطَ الثَّوْبَ [He spread, spread out,<br>\
expanded, or unfolded, the garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth]. (Msb.) And بَسَطَ رِجْلَهُ (tropical:) [He stretched<br>\
forth, or extended, his leg]. (TA.) And بَسَطَ<br>\
ذِرَاعَيْهِ, and ↓بَسَّطَهُمَا, (assumed tropical:) He spread his fore arms<br>\
upon the ground; the doing of which [in prostrating oneself] in prayer is forbidden. (TA.)<br>\
And بَسَطَ يَدَهُ (M, Msb, K) (tropical:) He stretched forth,<br>\
or extended, his arm, or hand; (M, K;) as in<br>\
the saying بَسَطَ إِلِىَّ يَدَهُ بِمَا أُحِبُّ وَأَكْرَهُ (tropical:)  [He<br>\
stretched forth, or extended, towards me his arm,<br>\
or hand, with, i. e. to do to me, what I liked and<br>\
disliked]: (M, TA: *) or he stretched forth his<br>\
hand opened. (Msb.) It is said in the Kur [v. 31],<br>\
لَئِنْ بَسَطْتَ إِلَىَّ يَدَكَ لِتَقْتُلَنِي (assumed tropical:) [Assuredly if thou<br>\
stretch forth towards me thy hand to slay me].<br>\
(M, TA.) بَسْطُ اليَدِ and الكَفِّ is sometimes used<br>\
to denote assaulting and smiting: [as in the last<br>\
of the exs. given above; and] as in the words of<br>\
the Kur [lx. 2], وَيَبُسُطُوا إِلَيْكُمْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ وَأَلْسِنَتَهُمْ<br>\
بِالسُّوْءِ (tropical:) [And they will stretch forth towards you<br>\
their hands and their tongues with evil]; (TA;)<br>\
i. e., by slaying, (Bd, Jel,) and smiting, (Jel,)<br>\
and reviling. (Bd, Jel.) And sometimes to denote<br>\
giving liberally: (TA:) [as in] بَسَطَ يَدَهُ فِى الإَنْفَاقِ<br>\
(tropical:) He [stretched forth his hand, opened, or] was<br>\
liberal or bountiful or munificent [in expenditure]:<br>\
(Msb:) see بَسِيطٌ, below. (TA.) And sometimes<br>\
to denote taking, or taking possession, or seizing:<br>\
as in the saying, (TA,) بُسِطَتْ يَدُهُ عَلَيْهِ (tropical:) [His<br>\
hand was stretched forth against him]; i. e. he<br>\
was made to have dominion over him by absolute<br>\
force and power. (K, TA.) And sometimes to<br>\
denote seeking, or demanding: [as in بَسَطَ كَفَّيْهِ<br>\
فِى الدُّعَآءِ (tropical:) He expanded his two hands in supplication; a common action, in which the two hands<br>\
are placed together like an open book upon a desk<br>\
before the face, in supplicating God:] see بَاسِطٌ,<br>\
below. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,] بَسَطْتُ لَهُ أَمْرِى<br>\
(tropical:) I displayed, or laid open, to him my state, or<br>\
case, or affair; syn. فَرَشْتُهُ إِيَّاهُ: (A in art. فرش:)<br>\
and أَمْرَهُ [his state, &amp;c.]. (TA in that art.) ―<br>\

الحَيَاةِ (assumed tropical:) [God diffuses the souls in the bodies at<br>\
the time of their being animated]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
[Hence also,] بَسَطَ اللّٰهُ الرِّزْقَ (assumed tropical:)  God multiplied, or<br>\
made abundant, and amplified, enlarged, or made<br>\
ample or plentiful, the means of subsistence. (Msb,<br>\
K. *) It is said in the Kur [ii. 246], وَاللّٰهُ يَبِضُ<br>\
وَيَبْسُطُ (Msb and TA in art. قبض, q. v.) And<br>\
you say, بَسَطَ عَلَيْهِمُ العَدْلَ (tropical:) [He largely extended<br>\
to them equity, or justice]; as also ↓بسّطهُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
[Hence also,] فُلَانٌ يَبْسُطُ عَبِيدَهُ ثُمَّ يَقْبِضُهُمْ (tropical:) [Such<br>\
a one enlarges the liberty of his slaves; then<br>\
abridges their liberty]. (A in art. قبض.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
[Hence also, بَسَطَ وَجْهَهُ (assumed tropical:) It unwrinkled, as<br>\
though it dilated, his countenance: see 7. And<br>\
بَسَطَ قَلْبَهُ (assumed tropical:)  It dilated his heart: see remarks on<br>\
قَبْضٌ and بَسْطٌ, as used by certain of the Soofees,<br>\
near the end of 1 in art. قبض. And] بَسَطَهُ, alone,<br>\
[signifies the same; or] (tropical:) it rejoiced him; rendered him joyous, or cheerful: (M, K, TA:)<br>\
because, when a man is rejoiced, his countenance<br>\
becomes unwrinkled (يَنْبَسِطُ), and he becomes<br>\
changed [and cheerful] in [its] complexion: it is<br>\
wrongly said, by MF, to be not tropical: that it<br>\
is tropical is asserted by Z, in the A: MF also<br>\
says that it is not post-classical; and in this he is<br>\
right; for it occurs in a saying of Mohammad:<br>\
thus in a trad. respecting Fátimeh, يَبْسُطُنِى مَا<br>\
يَبْسُطُهَا What rejoices her rejoices me: (TA:)<br>\
[see also قَبَضَهُ, where this saying is cited according<br>\
to another relation:] ↓أَبْسَطَنِى [as signifying (tropical:)  it<br>\
rejoiced me] is a mistake of the vulgar [obtaining<br>\
in the present day]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [Hence also,] الخَيْرُ<br>\
يَقْبِضُهُ وَالشَّرُّ يَبْسُطُهُ (tropical:) [Wealth makes him closefisted, tenacious, or niggardly; and poverty<br>\
makes him open-handed, liberal, or generous].<br>\
(A in art. قبض.) ―<br>\
-b8-  [Hence also,] بُسَطَ مِنْ فُلَانٍ<br>\
(tropical:)  He rendered such a one free from shyness, or<br>\
aversion: (S, O, K, TA:) he emboldened him;<br>\
incited him to [that kind of presumptuous boldness which is termed] دَالَّة. (Har p. 155.) [In the<br>\
CK, بَسَطَ فُلاناً من فُلانٍ is erroneously put for<br>\
بَسَطَ فُلَانٌ مِنْ فُلَانص] ―<br>\
-b9-  [Hence also,] بَسَطَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
فُلَانًا عَلَىَّ (tropical:) God made, or judged, such a one to<br>\

men. (K, TA.) And هٰذَا فِرَاشٌ يَبْسُطُكَ (tropical:) This is a<br>\

(A.) And فَرَشَ لِى فِرَاشاً لَا يَبْسُطُنِى He spread<br>\
for me a bed [not wide enough for me, or] that<br>\
was [too] narrow [for me], (ISk, S.) ―<br>\

also,] بَسَطَ العُدْرَ, (K,) aor. as above, (TA,) and<br>\
so the inf. n., (S, TA,) (tropical:) He accepted, or admitted,<br>\
the excuse. (S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b12-  All these significations<br>\
of the verb are ramifications of that first mentioned<br>\
above. (TA.)<br>\
-A2- بَسَطَ, aor.<br>\
بَسُطَ, (M, K,) inf. n. بَسَاطَةٌ,<br>\
(M,) (assumed tropical:) He was, or became, free, or unconstrained,<br>\
(مُنْبَسِطٌ,) with his tongue. (M, K.)<br>\

5<br>\
تَبَسَّطَ see 7. ―<br>\
-b2-  تبسّط فِى البِلَادِ (assumed tropical:) He journeyed<br>\
far and wide in the countries. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3- خَرَجَ<br>\
يَتَبَسَّطُ (assumed tropical:) He went forth betaking himself to the<br>\
gardens and green fields: from بَسَاطٌ signifying<br>\
&quot;land having sweet-smelling plants.&quot; (TA.)<br>\

say, انبسط الشَّيْءُ عَلَى الأَرْضِ [The thing became<br>\
spread or spread out, &amp;c., upon the ground]. (S.)<br>\
And انبسط النَّهَارُ The day became advanced, the<br>\

in like manner one uses the verb in relation to<br>\
other things. (M, TA.) ―<br>\

without alteration,] like غُفْرانٌ and رُضْوَانٌ; or,<br>\
accord. to some, it is most probably [↓بَسْطَانُ,]<br>\
