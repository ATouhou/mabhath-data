بَجَدَ بِالمَكَانِ, (S, A, L, K, *) aor.<br>\
بَجُدَ, (L,)<br>\
inf. n. بُجُودٌ (S, L, K) and تَبْجِيدٌ; (Kr;) and<br>\
↓ بجّد, inf. n. تَبْجِيدٌ; (L, K;) He remained,<br>\
stayed, abode, or dwelt, (S, A, L, K,) in the<br>\
place; (S, A, L;) settled, or remained fixed, in<br>\
it; not quitting it. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بَجَدَتِ الإِبَلُ, (L,<br>\
K,) inf. n. بُجُودٌ; and ↓ بجّدت; (L;) The camels<br>\
kept to the place of pasturing. (L, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
بَجَّدَ see 1, in two places.<br>\
بَجَدٌ A company, or an assembly, of men: and<br>\
a hundred, and more, of horses: (L, K:) on the<br>\
authority of El-Hejeree: (TA:) pl. بُجُودٌ. (L.)<br>\
بَجْدَةٌ i. q. أَصْلٌ [The root, basis, or foundation;<br>\
or the origin, or source; or the most essential<br>\
part, or very essence; of a thing]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[hence, app.,] The inward, or intrinsic, state or<br>\
circumstances of a case or an affair; as also<br>\
↓ بُجْدَةٌ and ↓ بُجُدَةٌ: (S, L, K:) or the true, or<br>\
real, state or circumstances thereof; the positive,<br>\
or established, truth thereof; from بَجَدَ بَالمَكَانِ.<br>\
(A.) You say, هُوَ عَالِمٌ بِبَجْدَةِ أَمْرِكَ, (S, A, L,)<br>\
and ↓ بِبُجْدَتِهِ, and ↓ بِبُجُدَتِهِ, (S, L,) He is acquainted with the inward, or intrinsic, state or<br>\
circumstances of thy case or affair: (S, L:) or,<br>\
with the true, or real, state or circumstances<br>\
thereof; with the positive, or established, truth<br>\
thereof. (A.) And عِنْدِهُ بَجْدَةُ ذٰلِكَ, (S, K,) with<br>\
fet-h, (S,) He possesses the knowledge of that.<br>\
(S, K.) And hence, (S,) هَوَ ابْنُ بَجْدَتِهَا, (S, K,)<br>\
contr. of هو ابن نجْدَتِهَا, (A in art, نجد,) or, as<br>\
in the books of proverbs, أَنَا ابْنُ بَجْدَتِهَا, the<br>\
[affixed] pronoun referring to الأَرْض [understood],<br>\
as is said by Meyd and Z, (TA,) applied to<br>\
[signify He is, or I am,] the person acquainted<br>\
with the thing; (S, L, K;) possessing, or exercising, the skill requisite for it; (S, L;) the discriminator, or discerner, thereof; (L;) and one<br>\
says likewise, هُوَ ابْنُ مَدِينَتِهَا وَابْنُ بَجْدَتِهَا: (TA:)<br>\
it is also applied to [signify he is, or I am,] the<br>\
skilful guide of the way [thereof]: (L, K:) and<br>\
hence, [accord. to some,] it is proverbially applied<br>\
to any one acquainted with an affair; skilful<br>\
therein: (TA:) and to [signify he is, or I am,]<br>\
the person who will not quit, or depart from, his<br>\
place; from the saying بَجَدَ بَالمَكَانِ: (L:) or<br>\
the person who will not depart from his saying:<br>\
(K: [there explained by the words لِمَنْ لَا يَبْرَحُ<br>\
مِنْ قَوْلِهِ: but the TA supplies some apparent<br>\
omissions in this explanation, making it to agree<br>\
with that which here immediately precedes it,<br>\
taken from the L; and adds that, in some copies<br>\
of the K, عن قوله is erroneously put for من قوله:<br>\
also, that he who remains in a place knows that<br>\
place:]) or, accord. to some, بَجْدَةٌ signifies dust,<br>\
or earth; so that أَنَا ابْنُ بَجْدَتَهَا is as though it<br>\
meant I am created of its dust, or earth. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Also A [desert, such as is termed] صَحْرِآء.<br>\
(K.) Kaab Ibn-Zuheyr uses the phrase اِبْنُ بَجْدَتَهَا<br>\
as meaning Its male chameleon; the pronoun<br>\
referring to a desert (فَلَاة) which he is describing.<br>\
(TA.) And you say of a land covered with<br>\
black locusts, أَصْبَحَتِ الأَرْضُ بَجْدَهً وَاحِدَةً [The<br>\
land became, or has become, one desert, destitute<br>\
of vegetable produce]. (L.)<br>\
بُجْدَهٌ and بُجُدَةٌ: see بَجْدَةٌ; each in two<br>\
places.<br>\
بِجَادٌ A striped garment of the kind called<br>\
كِسَآء, (S, A, L, K,) being one of the kinds of<br>\
كَسآء worn by the Arabs of the desert: (S, L:)<br>\
or, of which the wool has been spun, or twisted,<br>\
in the manner termed يَسْرَةً [app. a mistranscription for يَسْرًا (see فَتْلٌ يَسْرٌ in art. يسر)], and woven<br>\
with the instrument calledصِيصَة: pl. بُجُدٌ: a<br>\
single oblong piece thereof is called فَلِيجٌ, of<br>\
which the pl. is فُلُجٌ. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A kind<br>\
of tent, of [the soft hair called] وَبَر. (Ibn-ElKelbee, TA voce بَيْتٌ, q. v.)<br>\
بَاجِدٌ Remaining, staying, abiding, or dwelling,<br>\
in a place; (L;) settled, or remaining fixed, in<br>\
a land. (A.)<br>\
