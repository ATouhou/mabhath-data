بَخْبَخَ, (S, K,) inf. n. بَخْبَخَةٌ and<br>\
بِخْبَاخٌ, (TA,) [a verb imitative of the sound<br>\
which it signifies,] He (a camel [in a state of<br>\
excitement]) brayed, (S, K,) so that his شِقْشِقَة<br>\
[or faucial bag] filled his mouth: (S:) or, as<br>\
some say, began to bray. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,<br>\
perhaps,] He (a man) said [بَخْ] or بَخْ بَخْ [&amp;c.].<br>\
(TA, and Har p. 556.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence,] بَخْبَخَ<br>\
بِصُحْبَتِى He rejoiced in my company. (Har ubi<br>\
suprà.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And بَخْبَخَ الرَّجُلَ He said بَخْ or بَخْ بَخْ<br>\
&amp;c. to the man. (S.)<br>\
بَخْ, (S, A, K, &amp;c.,) [in some copies of the K<br>\
written بَخَّ, which is wrong, for it is] like بَلْ,<br>\
(A,) [i. e.] like قَدْ, (TA,) [perhaps, as I have<br>\
suggested above, from the sound made by a hecamel in a state of excitement,] a word used on<br>\
the occasion of praising; (S, A;) on praising one<br>\
from whom has proceeded a good and wonderful<br>\
action; (Har p. 142;) on approving a thing; (T,<br>\
S, Msb, K;) on being pleased with it, or having<br>\
one&#39;s admiration excited by it; (A, K;) or on the<br>\
occasion of glorying and of praising; (K;) in<br>\
pronouncing a thing great in estimation, (IAmb,)<br>\
or excellent; (AHeyth;) in deeming a thing<br>\
great in estimation, (AHei,) or good; (Mgh;)<br>\
or it means wonder, or admiration; (R;) and<br>\
sometimes it is used [ironically] to denote disapproval; also, as an exhortation to gentleness with<br>\
a thing, and to taking extraordinary pains; (TA;)<br>\
and in a case of expertness, or skilfulness: (AHei:)<br>\
it means نِعْمَ الرَّجُلُ and نِعْمَ الفِعْلُ [Excellent, or<br>\
most excellent, is the man! and, the deed!]; (Har<br>\
p. 142;) [or simply, excellent! or most excellent!<br>\
how good! how goodly! well done! bravo! and<br>\
the like;] or عَظُمَ الأَمْرُ and فَخُمَ [great in estimation is the thing, or affair, or event, or case!]:<br>\
(K:) MF observes, [probably from finding بَخَّ in<br>\
the place of بَخْ in his copy or copies of the K,] that<br>\
this explanation is like an express assertion that it<br>\
is a verb in the pret. tense, which requires consideration. (TA.) It is used alone; and in this<br>\
case you say, بَخْ, (K,) and بَخِ, (Msb, K,) with<br>\
kesr for its invariable termination, (Msb,) and<br>\
بَخٍ, and بَخٌ; (K, TA; [but in the CK, in the<br>\
place of بَخٍ and بَخٌ, we find بُخٌ;]) without tesh-deed, (T, Msb,) in most cases; (Msb;) but also<br>\
with teshdeed, (T, S, A,) like a noun; so that one<br>\
says, بَخٍ لَكَ and بَخٍّ [&amp;c., meaning I say excel-lent! &amp;c., to thee]: (S:). and one repeats it, (S,<br>\
A, K, &amp;c.,) for the sake of emphasis; (S, A;)<br>\
saying, بَخْ بَخْ, (IAmb, S, A, K, &amp;c.,) with the<br>\
خ quiescent like the ل in هَلْ and بَلْ, (IAmb,)<br>\
and بَخٍ بَخٍ, (S, A, R, K,) pronounced in the<br>\
latter manner, with tenween, when in connexion<br>\
with a following word, [and in this case only,<br>\
whereas it is pronounced in the former manner in<br>\
any case,] (S, A,) and بَخٍّ بَخٍّ, (S, * A, * R, K,)<br>\
and بَخٍ بَخْ, (K,) and بَخِّ بَخِّ. (R.)<br>\
جَمَلٌ بَخْبَاخُ الهَدِيرِ A camel that fills his mouth<br>\
with his شِقْشِقَة [or faucial bag] when he brays.<br>\
(S.)<br>\
إِبِلٌ مُبْخْبَخَةٌ Camels to which one says بَخْ بَخْ;<br>\
being pleased with them: (ISd, TA:) or largebellied camels; (K;) as also مُخَبْخَبَةٌ, which is<br>\
formed from the former by transposition; from<br>\
بَخْ بَخْ, or بَخٍ بَخْ, which is said by the Arabs in<br>\
praising a thing; as though, by reason of their<br>\
greatness, the people, seeing them, said, How<br>\
goodly are they! (TA.)<br>\
