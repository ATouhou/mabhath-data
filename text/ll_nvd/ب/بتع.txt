signifies wine: (K:) or wine made of honey:<br>\

أَبْتَعُ: see بَتِعٌ, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  It is also a<br>\
word used as a corroborative: you say, جَاؤُوا<br>\
أَجْمَعُونَ أَكْتَعُونَ أَبْتَعُونَ [They came, all of them,<br>\
or all together]: (S:) and جَآءَ القَوْمُ أَكْتَعُونَ<br>\
أَبْتَعُونَ أَبْصَعُونَ [the people, or company of men,<br>\
came, all of them, or all together]: (AHeyth:)<br>\
and جَاؤُوا كُلُّهُمْ أَجْمَعُونَ أَكْتَعُونَ أَبْتَعُونَ<br>\
[they came, all of them, all together]: these words<br>\
which follow اجمعون being imitative sequents to<br>\
it, not occurring save after it [in the order above]:<br>\
(O, K:) or one may begin with whichsoever of<br>\
them he will, after it. (Ibn-Keysán, K.) And<br>\
[the fem. is بَتْعَآءُ:] you say القَبِيلَةُ كُلُّهَا جَمْعَآءُ<br>\
كَتْعَآءُ بَصْعَآءُ بَتْعَآءُ [The tribe, all of it, all together:<br>\
in the CK, erroneously, كُثْعآءُ (with damm and<br>\
ث) and بُصْعاءُ and بُتْعاءُ]. (K.) And [the pl. of<br>\
بَتْعَآءُ is ↓ بُتَعُ, originally بَتْعَاوَاتٌ:] you say النِّسَآءُ<br>\
كُلُّهُنَّ جُمَعُ كُتَعُ بُصَعُ بُتَعُ [The women, all of<br>\
them, all together: in the CK, erroneously, جُمَعٌ<br>\
كُتَعٌ بُصَعٌ بُتَعٌ, though it is well known that each<br>\
of these is determinate, and imperfectly declinable]. (K.) It is only necessary that he who<br>\
mentions all these words should mention first<br>\
كُلّ, and follow it with the word formed from<br>\
ج م ع, then add the rest in whatsoever order he<br>\
will; but the more approved way is to put the<br>\
word formed from ك ت ع before the rest. (TA.)<br>\
Fr mentions the phrases أَعْجَبنِى القَصْرُ أَجْمَعَ [The<br>\
palace pleased me, all of it, or altogether], and<br>\
الدَّارُ جَمْعَآءَ [the house, all of it, or altogether],<br>\
with the accus. case, as denotative of state; but does<br>\
not allow أَجْمَعُونَ nor جُمَعُ to be used otherwise<br>\
than as corroboratives: IDrst, however, allows<br>\
أَجْمَعِينَ to be used as a denotative of state; and<br>\
this is correct; and accord. to both these ways<br>\
is related the trad., فَصَلُّوا جُلُوسًا أَجْمَعِينَ and<br>\
أَجْمَعُونَ [And pray ye sitting, all of you, or all<br>\
together]; though some make اجمعين [here] to<br>\
be a corroborative of a pronoun understood in the<br>\
accus. case, as though the speaker said, أَعْنِيكُمْ<br>\
أَجْمَعِينَ [I mean you, all of you, or all together].<br>\
(K.) [But see أَجْمعُ.]<br>\
