ابلس, (inf. n. إِبْلَاسٌ, S, &amp;c.,) He despaired,<br>\

course. (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, K.) ―<br>\

cut short, or stopped, (K, TA,) فِى حُجَّتِهِ [in his<br>\

(Har p. 138.)<br>\
بَلِسٌ Despairing, (مُبْلِسٌ,) and silent respecting<br>\
what is in his mind, (K, TA,) by reason of grief<br>\
or fear. (TA.)<br>\
بَلَاسٌ, (S, Msb, K,) like سَلَامٌ, (Msb,) and<br>\
سَحَابٌ, (K,) [in a copy of the M written بِلَاسٌ,]<br>\
A [garment, or piece of stuff, of the kind called]<br>\
مِسْح [i. e. of hair-cloth]: (S, M, Msb, K:) used<br>\
in this sense by the people of El-Medeeneh: (S:)<br>\
a Persian word; (AO, S, Msb;) originally بَلَاسٌ,<br>\
without ال: (TA:) arabicized: (S, Msb:) also<br>\
called by the Arabs پَلَاس, with the ب termed<br>\
مُشَبَّع: (TA:) pl. بُلُسٌ. (M, Msb, K.) [The pl.]<br>\
بُلُسٌ is also applied to Large sacks of مُسُوح [i. e.<br>\
hair-cloths], in which figs are put, [or, more probably, in which straw is put, for التِّين, which I<br>\
find in two copies of the S and in the TA, can<br>\
hardly be doubted to be a mistranscription of<br>\
التِّبْن], and upon which is paraded he who is<br>\
made a public example that others may take<br>\
warning from him, and the subject of a proclamation [acquainting the spectators with his offence]:<br>\
whence the imprecation, أَرَانِيكَ اللّٰهُ عَلَىالبُلُسِ<br>\
[May God show me thee upon the large haircloth-sacks]. (S, TA.)<br>\
بَلَسَانٌ [The balsam-tree; or the species that<br>\
produces the balsam of Mekkeh; i. e., the amyris<br>\
opobalsamum;] a certain kind of tree, (M,) or<br>\
shrub, resembling the حِنَّآء, (K,) having many<br>\
leaves, inclining to white, in odour resembling the<br>\
سَذَاب [or rue], (TA,) the berry of which has an<br>\
unguent, (Lth, M, TA,) which is hot, (Lth, TA,)<br>\
and its unguent is in great request: (Lth, K,<br>\
TA:) its unguent [opobalsamum] is more potent<br>\
than its berry [carpobalsamum], and its berry is<br>\
more so than its wood [xylobalsamum] : the best<br>\
of its wood is the smooth, tawny-coloured, pungent and sweet in odour: it is hot and dry in the<br>\
second degree; and its berry is a little hotter than<br>\
it: its wood opens stoppages of the nose, and is<br>\
good for the sciatica and vertigo and headache,<br>\
and clears cloudiness of the eye, and is good for<br>\
asthma and oppression of the breath, and for<br>\
flaccidity of the womb, used by fumigation; it is<br>\
also beneficial in cases of barrenness, and counteracts poisons and the bite of vipers: (the Minháj,<br>\
TA:) it is said in the K and in the Minháj, and<br>\
by most of the physicians and those who treat of<br>\
drugs, that it grows only at &#39;Eyn-Shems, in the<br>\
neighbourhood of El-Káhireh, the place called ElMatareeyeh; but MF observes that this is strange,<br>\
as it is well known that it is mostly found in the<br>\
district of El-Hijáz, between the Harameyn and<br>\
El-Yembo&#39; , whence it is conveyed to all countries:<br>\
the truth, however, is, that it ceased to grow at<br>\
&#39; Eyn-Shems in the latter part of the eighth century [of the Flight], and it was endeavoured<br>\
[successfully] to be made to grow in El-Hijáz.<br>\
(TA.) [See also De Sacy&#39;s “ Abd-allatif,” p. 89.]<br>\
بَلَّاسٌ One who sells what is termed بَلَاس. (K.)<br>\
إِبْلِيسُ [A name of Satan]; from أَبْلَسَ, (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K,) in the first of the senses assigned to it<br>\
above, (S, M, Msb,) accord. to some; (M, Msb,<br>\
K;) his former name being عَزَازِيلُ : (S, TA:) or<br>\
it is a foreign word, (Aboo-Is-hák, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
and for this reason, (Aboo-Is-hák, M, Msb, TA,)<br>\
and its being also determinate, (Aboo-Is-hák, M,<br>\
TA,) or a proper name, (Msb,) it is imperfectly<br>\
decl.; (Aboo-Is-hák, M, &amp;c.;) for if it were an<br>\
Arabic word, it would be perfectly decl., like<br>\
إِجْفِيلٌ and إِخْرِيطٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
