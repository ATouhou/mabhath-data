بَظِرَتْ, [aor.<br>\
بَظَرَ, inf. n. بَظَرٌ,] said of a woman,<br>\
[She had a بَظْر (q. v.), or a long بَظْر; or] she<br>\
was uncircumcised. (Msb.) [But see بَظَرٌ, below.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And بَظِر, inf. n. بَظَرٌ, He had what is termed<br>\
a بُظَارَة [q. v.] in his upper lip. (S.)<br>\
2<br>\
بَظَّرَتْ, inf. n. تَبْظِيرٌ, She circumcised a<br>\
female. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  هُوَ يُمِصُّهُ وَيُبَظِّرُهُ (M, K) He<br>\
says to him, اُمْصُصْ بَظْرَ فُلَانَةَ: (K:) a prov. of<br>\
the Arabs. (TA.)<br>\
بَظْرٌ, (Lh, T, S, M, &amp;c.,) also pronounced بَضْرٌ,<br>\
(T,) and ↓ بُظَارَةٌ [which see below] (Lh, T, S,<br>\
M, K) and ↓ بَظَارَةٌ (M, K) and ↓ بَيْظَرٌ (Lh, T, M,<br>\
K) and ↓ بُنْظُرٌ, (K,) A certain thing, (S, M,<br>\
Mgh, K,) or piece of flesh, (A,) between the two<br>\
sides of the vulva (الإِسْكَتَانِ, S, M, K, or الشُّفْرَانِ,<br>\
A, or شُفْرَا الفَرْجِ, Mgh) of a woman, (M, A,<br>\
Mgh, K,) which is cut off in circumcision, (A,)<br>\
not yet cut off; (S;) a piece of flesh between the two<br>\
sides of the vulva (الشُّفْرَانِ) of a woman; i. e.<br>\
the prepuce (قُلْقَة) that is cut off in circumcision;<br>\
(Msb;) also called كَيْنٌ and رَفْرَفٌ and نَوْفٌ<br>\
(Lh, T) and قُنْبٌ [which last properly signifies<br>\
the “ prepuce,” or “ sheath,” of a beast or horse<br>\
or the like]; (A and K in art. قنب;) and likened<br>\
to a cock&#39;s comb: (Msb in art. عرف:) [the last<br>\
of these explanations plainly shows that what is<br>\
meant thereby is the prepuce of the clitoris;<br>\
which, it seems, in the Arabian and Egyptian<br>\
races, and others throughout Eastern Africa, and<br>\
still more so in the Hottentot race, grows to an<br>\
extraordinary size; and this may be the reason<br>\
why the بظر is described by some travellers as<br>\
a caruncle for which we have no name: or it may,<br>\
perhaps, be a distinct excrescence from the prepuce of the clitoris: it has been described to me<br>\
as a caruncle a little in front of the meatus<br>\
urinarius: many of the Egyptians assert that it<br>\
is the clitoris itself that is amputated, (as Ludolph<br>\
also does in his Comment. to his Ethiop. Hist.<br>\
p. 273, finding fault with those who say otherwise;) and they affirm that this is done for the<br>\
purpose of lessening the libidinous passion: such,<br>\
indeed, appears to be the case in some instances,<br>\
but not generally; and it may have led to a misapplication of the term بظر in post-classical times:<br>\
an analogous practice, one still more barbarous,<br>\
is said to have obtained among an African race<br>\
hence called the Colobi: see بَرْبَرُ: Abu-l-Kásim<br>\
Ez-Zahráwee speaks of the amputation of the redundance of the بظر when preternaturally large,<br>\
and also of an excrescence in the vulva: the<br>\
former he describes in such a manner as plainly<br>\
shows that he means thereby the clitoris: the<br>\
latter, in terms apparently indicating a preternatural elongation of the lower part of the prepuce of the clitoris; as “ an excrescence of flesh<br>\
at, or in, the mouth of the vulva, such as fills it<br>\
up, and sometimes protrudes externally, like a<br>\
tail, wherefore the ancients term it the caudal<br>\
disease المرض الذنبى; and this,” he says,<br>\
“ should be amputated, like as the بظر is amputated ” when preternaturally large: (Albucasis de<br>\
Chirurgia, pp. 314 and 316:) in some of our<br>\
medical books, the term “ caudatio ” is defined<br>\
as “ an elongation of the clitoris; ” inconsistently<br>\
with the foregoing description of “ the caudal<br>\
disease: ”] the pl. [of mult.] of بَظْرٌ is بُظُورٌ, (M,<br>\
Msb, K,) and [pl. of pauc.] أَبْظُرٌ. (Msb.) يَا ابْنَ<br>\
مُقَطِّعَةِ البُظُورِ [O son of her who amputates<br>\
بظور !] is an expression of contumely employed<br>\
by the Arabs whether the mother of the person<br>\
addressed be really a circumciser of females or<br>\
not. (TA.)<br>\
