meant: or blood not flowing: or what flows<br>\
thereof at one single time: (M:) or a portion of<br>\
blood that glistens: (B:) and (as some say, M)<br>\
the blood of a virgin: (M, K:) and blood-revenge:<br>\
and a fine for homicide: (TA:) pl. بَصَائِرُ, as<br>\
above: (S, M:) and ↓ بَصِيرٌ, which occurs in a<br>\
verse cited by AHn, may also be a pl. of بَصِيرَةٌ,<br>\
applied to blood, [or rather a coll. gen. n., of<br>\
which بصيرة is the n. un.,] like as شَعِيرٌ is of<br>\
شَعِيرَةٌ; or it may be for بصيرة, the ة being elided<br>\
by poetic license; or it may be a dial. var. of<br>\
بصيرة, like as one says بَيَاضٌ and بَيَاضَةٌ. (M.) ElAs&#39;ar El-Joafee says,<br>\
رَاحوا بَصَائِرُهُمْ عَلَى أَكْتَافِهِمْ<br>\
وَبَصِيرَتِى يَعْدُو بِهَا عَتَدٌ وَأَى<br>\

himself: (S, Mgh:) or it means that his arms,<br>\
or hands, and his legs, or feet, and his tongue,<br>\
shall be witnesses against him on the day of<br>\
resurrection: (M:) Akh says that it is like the<br>\
saying to a man, أَنْتَ حُجَّةٌ عَلَى نَفْسِكَ: (S:)<br>\
the ة is added because the members are meant<br>\
thereby; (B;) or to give intensiveness to the<br>\
signification, (Mgh, B,) as in عَلَّامَةٌ and رَاوِيَةٌ;<br>\
(B;) or because the meaning is عَيْنٌ بَصِيرَةٌ.<br>\
(Mgh.) You say also, اِجْعَلْنِى بَصِيرَةً عَلَيْهِمْ (tropical:)  Make<br>\

and بِصَارٌ, as well as بَصَائِرُ, is a pl. thereof. (TA.)<br>\
Accord. to AO, the verse of El-Joafee cited above<br>\
commences thus:<br>\
حَمَلُوا بَصَائِرَهُمْ عَلَى أَكْتَافِهِمْ<br>\
and the meaning is, [They bore] their shields<br>\
[upon their shoulder-blades]; or their coats of<br>\
mail. (S.)<br>\

pl. بَصَائِرُ: (S:) and ↓ بَاصِرٌ signifies [in like manner] what is joined and sewed together (مُلَفَّق)<br>\
between two oblong pieces of cloth or two pieces of<br>\
rag. (TA.)<br>\
بَاصِرٌ: see بَصِيرٌ. ―<br>\
