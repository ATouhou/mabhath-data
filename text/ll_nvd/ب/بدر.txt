mutual effort only when it is immediately trans.:<br>\
when it is trans. by means of إِلَى [or بِ (the<br>\
former in the TA written by mistake على], there<br>\
is nothing to show that it denotes this. (MF.)<br>\
[But it is often immediately trans. without its<br>\
denoting such effort.] One says, بادرهُ He hastened<br>\
to do it [&amp;c., as explained above]; meaning, a<br>\
thing that he desired, or wished for: (TA:) [and<br>\
بادربِهِ signifies the same; or he hastened with it:<br>\

(M,) or اِسْتَبَقَ: (K:) [and مِنْهُ قَوْلٌ ↓ بَدَرَ, and فِعْلٌ,<br>\
a saying, and an action, proceeded from him<br>\

to be before the orphan&#39;s attaining to full age in<br>\
expending his property]; said of a guardian; i. q.<br>\
فِي مَالِ اليَتِيمِ ↓ أَبْدَرَ: (K:) and thus, بِدَارًاأَنْ<br>\
يَكْبَرُوا, in the Kur [iv. 5], means hastening to be<br>\
before their attaining to full age in expending<br>\
their property. (Bd, * Jel.) And بادرهُ الغَايَةَ and<br>\
إِلَى الغَايَةِ [He strove with him in hastening, or<br>\
strove to get before him, to the goal]. (A.) And<br>\
الغَايَةَ ↓ ابتدر and إِلَى الغَايَةِ [He strove in hastening, or strove to get first, to the goal]. (Ham<br>\

هٰذَا مَا يَتَبَادَرُ مِنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  [This meaning is what appears<br>\

بَدْرٌ, (S, A, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) originally an inf. n.,<br>\
(Msb,) The full moon; (M, A, Msb, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ بَادِرٌ; (L, K;) the moon in its fourteenth<br>\
night: (S:) or the latter signifies [simply] the<br>\
moon: (IAar, T:) the moon in its fourteenth<br>\
night is called بدر because it hastens to rise<br>\
before the sun sets; (S, M;) and to set before<br>\
the sun rises: (TA:) or because of its fulness;<br>\
(S, TA;) as being likened to a بَدْرَة: or, as Er-Rághib thinks to be most probable, it is itself a<br>\
primitive word: (TA:) pl. بُدُورٌ. (M, A.) Hence,<br>\
لَيْلَةُ البَدْرِ [The night of the full moon; which is]<br>\
the fourteenth night [of the lunar month]. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  A lord, master, or chief, (M, K,) of a people:<br>\

(M:) or i. q. ↓ مُبَادِرٌ [precocious]. (T, K.) [In<br>\

-b4-  (tropical:)  A cover; or a dish or<br>\
plate; syn. طَبَقٌ: (Ibn-Wahb, K:) because resembling the full moon, being round: so Az<br>\

to a horse&#39;s eye: (IAar, T, M:) or sharp-sighted:<br>\

(T.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, (S, M, K,) and ↓ بَدْرٌ, (K,) The<br>\
skin of a lamb or kid (S, M, K) when it has been<br>\
weaned, (AZ, S, M,) used for milk: for [when it<br>\
is killed] while it continues sucking, its skin, if<br>\
used for milk, is called شَكْوَةٌ; and for clarified<br>\
butter, عُكَّة: when it has been weaned, its skin for<br>\
milk is called بَدْرَة; and for clarified butter, مِسْأَد:<br>\
and when it is in its second year, its skin for milk<br>\
is called وَطْب; and for clarified butter, نِحْى:<br>\

only instance of the kind except هِضَبٌ pl. of<br>\
هَضْبَةٌ, and بِضَعٌ pl. of بَضْعَةٌ [or this may be pl. of<br>\
بِضْعَةٌ]. (M. [But the assertion of El-Fárisee is<br>\
incorrect (see حَيْضَةٌ), unless it be meant to apply<br>\
only to sound words; and in this case, at least<br>\
one addition should be made, namely قِصَعٌ pl. of<br>\
قَصْعَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (M,) the former word, (S,<br>\
M, A, K, &amp;c.,) and ↓ the latter also, (K,) The<br>\

reading is that followed in the TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بَدْرِيَّةُ A<br>\
she-camel whose mother has brought her forth at<br>\
an earlier period of the year than that when the<br>\
others brought forth, and therefore more abundant<br>\

-b3-  And the former, A fat young<br>\
camel weaned from its mother. (K.)<br>\
