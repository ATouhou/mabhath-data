بَغِثَ, (Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
بَغَثَ, (K,) inf. n. بُغْثَةٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) or this is a simple subst., and the inf. n. is<br>\
بَغَثٌ, (TA,) He (a bird) was, or became, of a<br>\
colour resembling that of ashes: (Msb:) or he (a<br>\
sheep or goat) was of the mixed colours of those<br>\
to which the epithet بَغْثَآءُ is applied. (K, TA.)<br>\
[See أَبْغَثُ, and بُغْثَةٌ, and بَغَثٌ.]<br>\
بَغَثٌ Dust-colour. (A.) [But see بُغْثَةٌ. Accord.<br>\
to the TA, the former is the inf. n. of 1, q. v.]<br>\
بُغْثَةٌ Whiteness inclining to خُضْرَة [which here<br>\
app. means a dark, or ashy, dust-colour]: (T:)<br>\
[or, in a bird, a colour resembling that of ashes:<br>\
(see 1:)] or the colour of sheep or goats to which<br>\
the epithet بَغْثَآءُ is applied. (K, TA.) [See أَبْغَثُ.]<br>\
بَغْثَآءُ: see أَبْغَثُ, of which it is the fem.<br>\
بَغَاثٌ (T, S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and بُغَاثٌ and<br>\
بِغَاثٌ; (A, Mgh, K;) only the second of these<br>\
three mentioned by Sb; (TA;) but the second<br>\
and third asserted to be correct by Yoo; (AZ,<br>\
TA;) and the last heard by Az; (TA;) or<br>\
neither of these two is allowable; (Msb;) A bird<br>\
that does not prey, and such as one does not desire<br>\
to make an object of prey because it is not eaten:<br>\
(T, Msb:) or small birds that do not prey, such<br>\
as sparrows and the like; [a coll. gen. n.;] n. un.<br>\
with ة: (Mgh:) or [accord. to Lth,] a certain<br>\
dust-coloured bird, (T, A, K,) of the birds of the<br>\
water, ash-coloured, and long-necked; as also<br>\
↓ أَبْغَثُ; pl. [of the latter] بُغْثٌ and أَبَاغِثُ: (T:)<br>\
[but this appears to be wrong; for AM says, in<br>\
the T,] Lth makes the بغاث and the ابغث to be<br>\
one, asserting them to be of aquatic birds; but in<br>\
my opinion, the former is different from the latter:<br>\
as to the latter, it is a well-known kind of aquatic<br>\
bird, so called because it is of the colour termed<br>\
بُغْثَة, i. e. white inclining to خُضْرَة [explained<br>\
above, voce بُغْثَةٌ]: but as to the بغاث, it is any<br>\
bird that is not one of prey: and the word is said<br>\
to be a coll. gen. n., signifying the class of birds<br>\
that are objects of prey: (TA:) ISk says that<br>\
the بَغَاث is a bird of a colour inclining to that of<br>\
dust, (S, Msb, *) a little less than the رَخَمَة [or<br>\
vultur percnopterus], (S,) or less than the رخمة,<br>\
(Msb,) slow in flight: (S, Msb:) but IB says<br>\
that this is a mistake in two points of view; first,<br>\
because بغاث is a [coll.] gen. n., of which the<br>\
n. un. is with ة, like as is that of حَمَامٌ; and<br>\
secondly, because it applies to the class of birds<br>\
that do not prey; but the ↓ أَبْغَث is a bird of the<br>\
colour of dust, and this may be a bird of prey,<br>\
and it may be not a bird of prey: (TA:) AZ<br>\
says that بغاث signifies the [species of vulture<br>\
called] رَخَم; and the n. un. is with ة others, the<br>\
young ones of the رخم and birds of the crowkind: or [birds] like the [hawks called] سَوَادِق<br>\
[pl. of سَوْدَقٌ], not predaceous: in the T, it is said<br>\
to be [a kind of bird] like the [hawk called] بَاشَق,<br>\
that does not prey upon any other bird: (TA:)<br>\
or بِغَاثٌ and بُغَاثٌ (ISd, K) and بَغَاثٌ (K) signify<br>\
the worst [or most ignoble] of birds, (ISd, K,<br>\
[the latter giving this as a second and distinct<br>\
signification,]) and such as do not prey: (ISd,<br>\
TA:) Fr says, بَغَاثُ الطَّيْرِ signifies the worst of<br>\
birds, and such as do not prey; and بُغَاثٌ and<br>\
بِغَاثٌ are dial. vars.: (S:) the pl. is بِغْثَانٌ, (Sb,<br>\
T, S, Msb, K,) accord. to those who make بغاث a<br>\
sing., (Yoo, S, Msb, TA,) or accord. to those who<br>\
make the sing. to be with ة; (T, TA;) or those<br>\
who apply بَغَاثَةٌ [as a n. un.] to the male and the female make بَغَاثٌ to be pl. [or rather a coll. gen. n.];<br>\
(Yoo, S, Msb;) as is done in the case of نَعَامَةٌ and<br>\
نَعَامٌ: (Yoo, S:) ISd says that بَغَاثَةٌ, with fet-h,<br>\
is the n. un., applied alike to the male and the<br>\
female: (TA:) [and Fei says,] it is not allowable<br>\
to pronounce this with damm or with kesr to the<br>\
first letter: (Msb:) but Yoo asserts both of these<br>\
forms to be used: (AZ, TA:) and بغاثة is said to<br>\
signify a weak bird. (TA.) It is said in a prov.,<br>\
إِنَّ البَغَاثَ بِأَرْضِنَا يَسْتَنْسِرُ (S, A, Msb, K *) Verily<br>\
the بغاث in our land becomes [like] a vulture, or<br>\
become [like] vultures: (Msb:) applied to the<br>\
low person who becomes of high rank: (A:)<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  the weak in our land becomes strong:<br>\
(Msb:) or he who makes himself our neighbour<br>\
becomes mighty, strong, or of high rank, by our<br>\
means, (S, K, TA,) acquiring the might, or strength,<br>\
of the vulture, after having been low, or mean, in<br>\
condition. (TA.)<br>\
بَغِيثٌ Wheat (حِنْطَةٌ and طَعَامٌ [both of which<br>\
signify the same, though the latter, q. v., has a<br>\
a larger application,]) adulterated by being mixed<br>\
with barley; (Th, K;) as also غَلِيثٌ and لَغِيثٌ.<br>\
(Th, TA.)<br>\
بُغَيْثَآءُ [dim. of بَغْثَآءُ fem. of أَبْغَثُ, q. v.,] The<br>\
place of the حَقِيبَة [q. v.] in a camel. (K.) [So<br>\
called because of its colour, produced by chafing.]<br>\
أَبْغَثُ Of a white colour inclining to خُضْرَة<br>\
[which here app. means a dark, or ashy, dustcolour]: (T:) [or of a colour resembling that of<br>\
ashes: (see 1:)] or dust-coloured: (A:) or of a<br>\
colour near to that of dust: (S:) an epithet, like<br>\
أَحْمَرُ: [fem. بَغْثَآءُ: and] pl. بُغْثٌ: and sometimes,<br>\
when used as a subst., it has for pl. أَبَاغِثُ. (IB,<br>\
TA.) You say طَائِرٌ أَبْغَثُ A bird of the colour<br>\
above described: (T, S:) whether it be a bird of<br>\
prey or not: see بَغَاثٌ in two places: (IB, TA:)<br>\
and صَقْرٌ أَبْغَثُ [a hawk of that colour.]; (ISh,<br>\
A;) as well as أَحْوَى and أَبْيَضُ; i. e., that wherewith men take game. (ISh, TA.) بَغْثَآءُ applied<br>\
to sheep or goats, (S, K,) or, as in some lexicons,<br>\
to sheep, (TA,) is like رَقْطَآءُ; (S, K;) [Black<br>\
speckled with white; or the reverse;] or in which<br>\
are blackness and whiteness, with predominance<br>\
of the latter colour: (TA:) or شَاةٌ بَغْثَآءُ and غَنَمٌ<br>\
بُغْثٌ signify a sheep or goat, and sheep or goats,<br>\
in which are blackness and whiteness. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
[as a subst.,] A certain bird, (K, TA,) dustcoloured, in truth different from the بَغَاث, as<br>\
shown above: see the latter word: (TA:) pl.<br>\
بُغْثٌ and أَبَاغِثُ. (T, TA.) You say, هُوَ مِنْ أَبَاغِثِ<br>\
الطَّيْرِ [He is of the birds thus called]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And الأَبْغَثُ signifies The lion; (TS, K;) because<br>\
he is of the colour termed بُغْثَةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
البَغْثَآءُ (tropical:)  The medley, or mixed or promiscuous<br>\
multitude or collection, of men or people; or of<br>\
the lowest or basest or meanest sort, or refuse, or<br>\
riffraff, thereof; (S, A, K;) the commonalty, or<br>\
vulgar, and collective body, of the people. (S.)<br>\
One says, خَرَجَ فَلَانٌ فِى البَغْثَآءِ and الغَثْرَآءِ (tropical:)  Such<br>\
a one went forth among the medley, &amp;c., of the<br>\
people. (A.) And دَخَلْنَا فِى البَغْثَآءِ (tropical:)  We entered<br>\
among the commonalty, or vulgar, and the collective body, of the people. (S.)<br>\
