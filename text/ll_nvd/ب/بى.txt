بَيَّيْتُ الشَّىْءَ, (T, K,) inf. n. تَبْيِىٌّ, (K,) I<br>\
made the thing apparent, manifest, evident, clear,<br>\
plain, or perspicuous. (As, T, K*)<br>\
-A2-  Also, (K,<br>\
as in the TA,) or الشَّىءَ, ↓,تَبَّيَيْتُ (M, and so in<br>\
several copies of the K,) [both confirmed by what<br>\
follows,] i. q. تَعَمَّدْتُهُ [meaning I directed myself, or my course, or aim, to, or towards, the<br>\
thing; made for it, or towards it; made it my<br>\
object; &amp;c.]. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In the saying, حَيَّاكَ<br>\
اللّٰهُ وَ بَيَّاكَ, the phrase حياك اللّه means May God<br>\
make thee to have dominion: (S, M:) or may<br>\
God prolong thy life: (M:) and بيّاك means<br>\
اِعْتَمَدَكَ بِالتَّحِيَّةِ [may He bring thee prolongation<br>\
of life; lit. may He direct himself to thee, or the<br>\
like, with the gift of prolongation of life]; (As,<br>\
S;) or قَصَدَكَ بِالتَّحِيَّةِ [which is the same]: (IAar,<br>\
T:) or اِعْتَمَدَكَ بِالْمُلْكِ [may He bring thee dominion]; (M;) so too says IAar: (TA:) or may<br>\
He make thy state, or condition, to be good:<br>\
(TA:) or may He make thee to laugh: (T, S,<br>\
M, K:) so some say, accord. to As: (T:) and<br>\
it is related that these words were addressed<br>\
to Adam, in consequence of his having remained<br>\
a hundred years without laughing after his son<br>\
had been slain: (T, S:) so says A&#39;Obeyd, on<br>\
the authority of Sa&#39;eed Ibn-Jubeyr: (T:) or it<br>\
means may He bring thee near [unto Himself]:<br>\
(Aboo-Málik, As, T, M, K:) or may He bring<br>\
thee: (IAar, S, M:) or may He prepare for thee<br>\
an abode; i. q. بَوَّأَكَ, (K,) or بَوَّأَكَ مَنْزِلًا; the verb<br>\
being here altered in order to assimilate it to the<br>\
preceding verb, حَيَّا: (El-Ahmar, T, S:) this<br>\
explanation was approved by As: (S:) the meaning intended thereby is, may He lodge thee in an<br>\
abode in Paradise: (TA:) or, as some say, the<br>\
verb in this case is an imitative sequent to that<br>\
preceding it: (A&#39;Obeyd, S K: *) but this is<br>\
naught: (K:) A&#39;Obeyd says that in his opinion<br>\
it is not an imitative sequent, because an imitative<br>\
sequent is scarcely ever coupled with what precedes it by و. (S.) As an ex. of بَيَّا in the sense<br>\
of قَرَّبَ, Aboo-Málik cites this verse:<br>\
اَلْكِبْدَ وَالمَلْحَآءَ وَ السَّنَامَا  بَيَّا لَهُمْ إِذْ نَزَلُوا الطَّعَامَا<br>\
[He brought near to them, i. e., placed before<br>\
them, when they alighted, the food, namely, the<br>\
liver, and the flesh of the back extending from the<br>\
withers to the rump, and the hump]. (T.) And<br>\
IAar, explaining بيّاك as meaning قصدك بالتحيّة,<br>\
cites the following verse:<br>\
أَعْطَى عَطَآءَ اللَّحِزِ اللَّئِيمِ  أَبَا تَمِيمِ ↓ لَمَّا تَبَّيَيْنَا<br>\
(T.) Accord. to J, the meaning in this instances<br>\
may be agreeable with the explanation of بيّاك by<br>\
اعتمدك بالتحيّة [so that the verse may be rendered When we betook ourselves with salutation<br>\
to the father of Temeem, or, as the verse is cited<br>\
in the S, to the brother of Temeem (أَخَا تميم), he<br>\
gave the gift of the niggardly, the mean]: or it<br>\
may mean we brought: and the verb admits of<br>\
the same double rendering in other instances.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  بَيَّيْتُ بَآءً حَسَنَةً and حَسَنًا [I made, or<br>\
wrote, a beautiful ب]. (TA in باب الالف الليّنة.)<br>\
5<br>\
تبيّا It was, or became, apparent, manifest,<br>\
evident, clear, plain, or perspicuous, being near;<br>\
syn. تَبَيَّنَ مِنْ قُرْبٍ. (As, T.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
البَىٌّ The low, ignoble, mean, or contemptible,<br>\
man; as also ↓ اِبْنُ بَيَّانَ, (IAar, T, K) and ابن<br>\
هَيَّانَ, (IAar, T,) and ابن بَىّ, (K,) or هَىُّ بْنُ بَىّ,<br>\
and ↓ هَيَّانُ بْنُ بَيَّانَ: (Lth, T:) or the last two<br>\
signify he whose stock and branch are unknown:<br>\
(M:) or the same two, he who is unknown, and<br>\
whose father also is unknown: (K in art. هى;<br>\
and so the latter of them is explained in the S,<br>\
both there and in the present art.:) and one says,<br>\
مَا أَدْرِى أَىُّ هَىِّ بْنِ بَىٍّ هُوَ, meaning I know not<br>\
what man he is.. (S.) Accord. to some, (Lth, T,)<br>\
هَىُّ بْنُ بَىٍّ was one of the sons of Adam, that<br>\
went away in the earth when the rest of his<br>\
children dispersed themselves, and no trace of<br>\
him was afterwards perceived. (Lth, T, K.)<br>\
اِبْنُ بَيَّانَ: see البَىُّ, in two places.<br>\
بَيَوِىٌّ rel. n. of بَآءٌ or بَا: whence قَصِيدَةٌ بَيَوِيَّةٌ<br>\
