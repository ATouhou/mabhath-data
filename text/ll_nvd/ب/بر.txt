was good, just, righteous, virtuous, or honest: (T,<br>\
Msb:) [or he was amply, largely, or extensively,<br>\
good or beneficent:] and he was true, or veracious. (M, Msb, K.) [Authorities differ as to<br>\
the primary signification of this verb, and as to<br>\
the subordinate meanings: see بِرٌّ below.] You<br>\

sinlessly, performed;] all signify the same. (M.)<br>\
And بُرَّ العَمَلُ, i. e. الحَجُّ, a form of benediction,<br>\
said to a person come from pilgrimage, May the<br>\

of speech; as explained by Mohammad himself:<br>\

-b3-  بَرَّ, (A,<br>\
Msb, K,) aor. يَبَرُّ (T, M, K) and يَبِرُّ, (M, K,)<br>\
inf. n. بِرٌّ (M, Msb, K) and بَرٌّ and بُرُورٌ, (M, K,)<br>\
It (a saying, Msb, and an oath, T, A, M, Msb,<br>\

TA.) [See an ex. voce أَلِيَّةٌ, in art. الو.] ―<br>\
-b4-  بَرَّتْ<br>\
بِى سِلْعَتُهُ, inf. n. بِرٌّ, (tropical:)  His commodity, or article<br>\
of merchandise, was easy of sale to me, (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, T, A, *) and procured me gain: (A:)<br>\
originally meaning it recompensed me, by its<br>\
high price, for my care of it. (T.) [See also بَرَّهُ,<br>\

-A2-  بَرَّ وَالِدَهُ, (M,) [and app. بِوَالِدِهِ, (see<br>\

pleasing to him, and to avoid what were displeasing to him. (Msb.) And [hence, app., for<br>\

Creator, or his Lord; (S, M, * A, K; *) [was<br>\

obedience. (B, TA.) [بَرَّهُ بِكَذَا (occurring in the<br>\
S and K in explanation of أَلْطَفَهُ بِكَذَا) may be<br>\
rendered He showed kindness, &amp;c., to him by<br>\
such a thing, or such an action, &amp;c.: and also<br>\
he presented him with such a thing; like وَصَلَهُ<br>\
بِكَذَا.] ―<br>\

part. n. مَبْرُورٌ, which see below:] and one says,<br>\

art. لطف: but only the inf. n. is there mentioned.<br>\
[See also 1.])<br>\
4<br>\
ابرّ عَمَلُهُ: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  ابرّ حَجَّهُ, and عَمَلَهُ:<br>\
see 1, near the end of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  ابرّ القَوْلَ,<br>\
(Msb,) and اليَمِينَ, (T, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
He executed, or performed, the saying, and the<br>\
oath, truly. (M, A, Mgh, Msb, K.) Accord. to<br>\
El-Ahmar, one also says, قَسَمِى ↓ بَرِرْتُ; but<br>\

(TA;) by actions or sayings; (TA;) as also<br>\
↓ بَرَّهُمْ, aor. يَبُرُّ: (T, K, TA:) he was refractory,<br>\
or stubborn, and overcame them. (TA, from a<br>\
trad.) You say, ابرّ عَلَى خَصْمِهِ [He overcame<br>\
his adversary]. (A.) And ابرّ عَلَيْهِمْ شَرًّا [He<br>\
overcame them in evil]: and hence ابرّ is used<br>\
in the sense of فَجَرَ [he transgressed, &amp;c.]; as<br>\
in the saying of a poet,<br>\
فَلَسْتُ أُبَالِى مَنْ أَبَرَّ وَ مَنْ فَجَرْ<br>\
[Then I care not who acts wickedly and who<br>\

-b2-<br>\
قَدْ تَبَرَّرْتَ فِى أَمْرِنَا Thou hast abstained from<br>\
crime, or sin, or the like, in our affair, or business,<br>\
or case. (T, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  تبرّر خَالِقَهُ: see 1.<br>\
6<br>\
تبارّوا They practised mutual بِرّ [meaning<br>\

and raised a clamour, or confused noise, (M, K,)<br>\
with his tongue: (M:) he cried, or cried out,<br>\

بَرْبَرَ فِى كَلَامِهِ He was profuse and unprofitable<br>\
in his talk. (Fr.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, inf. n. as above, He<br>\
(a goat) uttered a cry or cries, [or rattled,] (M,<br>\
K,) being excited by desire of the female. (M.)<br>\
بَرٌّ [originally بَرِرٌ] (M, Msb, K) and ↓ بَارٌّ (Msb)<br>\
Pious [towards his father or parents, and (tropical:)  towards God; (tropical:)  obedient to God, serving God, or<br>\
rendering religious service to God; (see 1;) and<br>\
kind, or good and affectionate and gentle in<br>\
behaviour, towards his kindred; and good in his<br>\
dealings with strangers]; good, just, righteous,<br>\
virtuous, or honest: (Msb:) true, or veracious:<br>\
(M, Msb, K:) and both signify also abounding in<br>\
بِرّ [or filial piety, &amp;c.]: (K:) the former is [said<br>\
to be] a stronger epithet than the latter, like as<br>\
عَدْلٌ is stronger than عَادِلٌ: (B:) [but its pl.<br>\
shows that it is not, like عَدْلٌ, originally an<br>\
inf. n.: it is a regular contraction of بَرِرٌ, like<br>\
as بَارٌّ is of بَارِرٌ:] the fem. of each is with ة: (Lh,<br>\
M:) the pl. (of the former, S, M, Msb, or of the<br>\
latter, B) is أَبْرَاٌ; and (of the latter, S, M, Msb,<br>\
or of the former, B) بَرَرَةٌ: (S, M, Msb, K:) the<br>\
former pl. is often specially applied to saints,<br>\
those who abstain from worldly pleasures, and<br>\
devotees; and the latter, to the recording angels.<br>\
(B.) You say, أَنَا بَرٌّ بِوَالِدِى, and ↓ بَارٌّ, I am<br>\
characterized by filial piety, dutifulness, or obedience, to my father: (S, M, A: *) the latter is<br>\
mentioned on the authority of Kr; but some<br>\
disallow it. (M, TA.) And الأُمُّ بَرَّةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا [The<br>\
mother is maternally affectionate to her child, or<br>\
offspring]. (S.) And رَجُلٌ بَرٌّ بِذِى قَرَابَتِهِ, and<br>\
↓ بَارٌّ, A man who behaves towards his kindred<br>\
with kindness, or goodness and affection and gentleness, and regard for their circumstances. (T.)<br>\
And رَجُلٌ بَرٌّ سَرٌّ A man who treats with goodness<br>\
and affection and gentleness, and rejoices, or<br>\
gladdens, his brethren: pl. بَرُّونَ سَرُّونَ. (S, * K, *<br>\
TA, in art. سر.) And بَرٌّ فِى قَوْلٍ, and فِى يَمِينٍ,<br>\
and ↓ بَارٌّ, True, or veracious, in a saying, and in<br>\
an oath. (Msb.) And يَمِينٌ بَرَّةٌ and ↓ بَارَّةٌ [A<br>\
true oath; or an oath that proves true]. (Ham<br>\
p. 811.) البَرُّ is also a name of God; (M, K;)<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  The Merciful, or Compassionate:<br>\
(M:) or the Very Benign to his servants;<br>\
(IAth;) the Ample in goodness or beneficence:<br>\
(B:) البَارُّ is not so used. (IAth.) It is said in<br>\
a trad., تَمَسَّحُوا بِالأَرْضِ فَإِنَّهَا بَرَّةٌ بِكُمْ (assumed tropical:)  Wipe yourselves with the dust, or earth, [in performing the<br>\
ceremony termed التَّيَمُّمُ,] for it is benignant<br>\
towards you, like as the mother is to her children;<br>\
meaning, ye are created from it, and in it are<br>\
your means of subsistence, and to it ye return<br>\
after death: (IAth:) or the meaning is, that your<br>\
tents, or houses, are upon it, and ye are buried in<br>\
it. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  بَرٌّ Land; opposed to بَحْرٌ [as meaning “ sea ” and the like]: (S, Msb, K:) from بِرٌّ<br>\
signifying “ ampleness,” “ largeness,” or “ extensiveness; ” (Esh-Shiháb [El-Khafájee], MF;)<br>\
or the former word is the original of the latter.<br>\
(B, TA. [See the latter word.]) [Hence, بَرًّا وَ بَحْرًا<br>\
By land and by sea.] ―<br>\
-b2-  A desert, or deserts; a<br>\
waste, or wastes. (T, TA. [See also بَرِّيَّةٌ, voce<br>\
بَرِّيٌّ.]) So, accord. to Mujáhid [and the Jel] in<br>\
words of the Kur [vi. 59], وَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِى البَرِّ وَ البَحْرِ<br>\
And He knoweth what is in the desert, or deserts,<br>\
and the towns, or villages, in which is water, (T,<br>\
TA,) or which are upon the rivers. (Jel.) [So<br>\
too in the phrase نَبَاتُ البَرِّ The plants, or herbage,<br>\
of the desert or waste; the wild plants or herbage.<br>\
And عَسَلُ البَرِّ Honey of the desert; wild honey.<br>\
And حَيَوَانُ البَرِّ The animal, or animals, of the<br>\
desert; the wild animal or animals.] ―<br>\
-b3-  A wide<br>\
tract of land. (Bd in ii. 41.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [The open<br>\
country; opposed to بَحْرٌ as meaning the<br>\
“ cities,” or “ towns,” “ upon the rivers: ” see the<br>\
latter word.] ―<br>\
-b5-  Elevated ground, open to view.<br>\
(T.) ―<br>\
-b6-  The tract, or part, out of doors, or where<br>\
one is exposed to view; contr. of كِنٌّ: used by<br>\
the Arabs indeterminately; [without the article<br>\
ال;] as in the phrase, جَلَسْتُ بَرًّا (Lth, T) meaning I sat outside the house; (A;) and خَرَجْتُ بَرًّا<br>\
(Lth, T) meaning I went forth outside the [house<br>\
or] town, (A,) or into the desert: (TA:) but [Az<br>\
says,] these are post-classical phrases, which I<br>\
have not heard from the chaste-speaking Arabs of<br>\
the desert. (T.) ―<br>\
-b7-  You say also, أَرِيدُ جَوًّا وَ يُرِيدُ بَرًّا<br>\
I desire concealment, or secrecy, and he desires<br>\
publicity. (A.)<br>\
بُرٌّ Wheat; and the grain of wheat; syn. قَمْحٌ,<br>\
(S, * Msb,) or حِنْطَةٌ; (M, K;) but it is a more<br>\
chaste word than قَمْحٌ and حِنْطَةٌ: (M:) pl. of<br>\
بُرَّةٌ; (S, M;) or [rather] بُرَّةٌ is the n. un. [signifying a grain of wheat, like قَمْحَةٌ]: (IDrd,<br>\
Msb:) the pl. of بُرٌّ is أَبْرَارٌ; (K;) or this pl. is<br>\
allowable on the ground of analogy, accord. to<br>\
Mbr, but is disallowed by Sb. (S.) It is said in<br>\
a prov., (TA,) هُوَ أَقْصَرُ مِنْ برَّةٍ [He, or it, is<br>\
shorter than a grain of wheat]. (A, TA.) And<br>\
you say, أَطْعمَنَا ابْنَ بُرَّةٍ He fed us with bread.<br>\
(A.)<br>\
بِرٌّ inf. n. of 1: (T, S, M, &amp;c.:) it is said by<br>\
some to signify primarily Ampleness, largeness, or<br>\
extensiveness; whence بَرٌّ as opposed to بَحْرٌ:<br>\
then, ―<br>\
-b2-  Benevolent and solicitous regard or treatment or conduct [to parents and others; i. e. piety<br>\
to parents; and (tropical:)  towards God]: and goodness,<br>\
or beneficence: and kindness, or good and affectionate and gentle behaviour, and regard for the<br>\
circumstances of another: (Esh-Shiháb [El-Khafájee], MF:) or بَرٌّ, as opposed to بَحْرٌ, [or as<br>\
signifying “ a wide tract of land,” (Bd in ii. 41,)]<br>\
is the original of بِرٌّ, (Bd in ii. 41, B, TA,) which<br>\
signifies ample, large, or extensive, goodness or<br>\
beneficence, (Z, in the Ksh, ii. 41, [but he regards<br>\
it as the original of بَرٌّ,] and Bd on the same<br>\
passage, and B, K, TA,) to men; (TA;) or comprehending every kind of goodness: (Ksh and<br>\
Bd ubi suprà:) and hence it is said to be in three<br>\
things: in the service of God: in paying regard<br>\
to relations; acting well to them: and in dealing<br>\
with strangers: (Bd ubi suprà:) or every deed<br>\
that is approved: (Ksh and Bd in ii. 172:) and<br>\
[particularly] obedience to God: (T, S, M, &amp;c.:<br>\
[see also بَرَّةُ:]) [and every incumbent duty: and<br>\
hence,] the pilgrimage to Mekkeh: (K:) and<br>\
fidelity to an engagement: (TA:) also a gratuitous gift, or favour; and a bounty, or benefit;<br>\
syn. فَضْلٌ; (Msb;) and إِحْسَانٌ; as also ↓ مَبَرَّةٌ<br>\
[an inf. n., but when used as a simple subst. its<br>\
pl. is مَبَارٌ and مَبَرَّاتٌ]. (Har p. 94.) In the Kur<br>\
[ii. 172], where it is said, لُكِنَّ البِرَّ مَنْ آمَنَ بِااللّٰهِ,<br>\
by البرّ is meant ذَا البِرِّ [i. e. But the pious, or<br>\
obedient to God, is he who believeth in God]; (T,<br>\
M, Ksh, Bd, Jel;) and some read البَارَّ: (Ksh,<br>\
Bd, Jel:) or the meaning is, لكنّ البِرَّ بِرُّ من آمن<br>\
با للّٰه i. e. but the obedience of which it behooveth<br>\
one to be mindful is the obedience of him who<br>\
believeth in God: (Sb, T, IJ, M, Ksh, Bd:) and<br>\
this explanation is preferable to the former. (Bd.)<br>\
It is said in a prov., (T, S,) لَا يَعْرِفُ هِرًّا مِنْ بِرٍ,<br>\
(S, A, K, but in the T and M مَا is put in the<br>\
place of لا,) meaning He knows not him who dislikes him, or hates him, from him who behaves<br>\
towards him with kindness, or goodness and affection and gentleness, and regard for his circumstances: (S, M, A, K, * TA:) or undutiful conduct<br>\
to a parent from gentleness, or courtesy: (ElFezáree, T, K:) or altercation, (T,) or dislike, or<br>\
hatred, (K,) from honourable treatment: (T, K:)<br>\
or the calling of sheep, or goats, from the driving<br>\
of them: (IAar, S, K:) or the driving of sheep,<br>\
or goats, from the calling of them: (Yoo, T:) or<br>\
the calling of them to water from the calling of<br>\
them to fodder; (K;) which last rendering is<br>\
agreeable with an explanation of بِرٌّ by IAar [mentioned in the T]; (TA;) and ↓ بِرْبِرٌ, also, has<br>\
the signification here assigned to بِرٌّ: (K, * TA:)<br>\
or الهَرْهَرَة from البَرْبَرَة; (A&#39;Obeyd, T, K;) i. e.<br>\
the crying of sheep from the crying of goats:<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, T:) or the cat from the rat, or mouse:<br>\
(IAar, T, M, K:) and بِرٌّ also signifies the [species<br>\
of rat called] جُرَذ: (Aboo-Tálib, T, K:) or a<br>\
small animal resembling the rat or mouse: (M:)<br>\
and the young of the fox. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Good,<br>\
as a subst., not an adj.; syn. خَيْرٌ; (Sh, T, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K;) which comprises all that has been said<br>\
in explanation of بِرٌّ (Sh, T, Mgh) as used in the<br>\
saying of Mohammad, عَليْكُمْ بِالصِّدْقِ فَإِنَّهُ يَهْدِى<br>\
إِلَى البِرِّ [Keep ye to truth; for it guides to good,<br>\
or to a good, or right, state]: some render it in<br>\
this instance by الخَيْر; and some, by الصَّلَاح. (Sh,<br>\
T.) It signifies also The good of the present life,<br>\
consisting in spiritual and worldly blessings, and<br>\
of that which is to come, consisting in everlasting<br>\
enjoyment in Paradise: so in the Kur iii. 86:<br>\
(T:) or [simply] Paradise. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also The<br>\
heart; or the mind. (K.) So in the saying,<br>\
هُوَ مُطْمَئِنُّ البِرِّ [He is quiet, or at rest, in heart,<br>\
or mind]. (TA.)<br>\
بَرَّةُ a subst. in the sense of البِرُّ, (S, M, K,)<br>\
meaning Obedience [&amp;c.]; (K;) determinate, (S,<br>\
K,) being a proper name; for which reason, combined with its being of the fem. gender, it is<br>\
imperfectly decl. (M.) [It is opposed to فَجَارِ.<br>\
See a verse of En-Nábighah in the first paragraph<br>\
of art. حمل.]<br>\
بَرِيرٌ [a coll. gen. n.] The fruit of the أَرَاك [q. v.],<br>\
(S, M,) in a general sense: (M:) or the first<br>\
thereof; (K;) [i. e.] the first that appears, or<br>\
when it first appears, and is sweet: (M:) or<br>\
when it has become hard: (Msb:) or when it is<br>\
larger in its berries (حَبّ) than such as is termed<br>\
كَبَاث, and smaller in its clusters; having a<br>\
round, small, hard stone, a little larger than the<br>\
حِمَّص; its cluster filling the hand: (AHn, M:)<br>\
n. un. with ة. (AHn, S, M, Msb.)<br>\
بُرَّى A good, sweet, or pleasant, word or expression or saying: (K:) from بِرٌّ signifying “ benevolent and solicitous regard or treatment or conduct. ” (TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
بَرِّىٌّ Of, or belonging to, or relating to, the<br>\
land as opposed to the sea or a great river. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And Of, or belonging to, or relating to, the desert<br>\
or waste; growing, or living, or produced, in the<br>\
desert or waste; wild, or in an uncultivated state. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And hence,] أَرْضٌ بَرِّيَّةٌ Uncultivated land; without seed-produce, and unfruitful; without green<br>\

contr. of رِيفِيَّةٌ. (IAar, M, K. *) And, simply,<br>\
↓ بَرَّيَّةٌ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) and ↓ بَرِّيتٌ, (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
IAar, Sh, S, K,) the latter a variation of the former,<br>\
the ى being made quiescent, and the ة therefore<br>\
being changed into ت, as in عِفْرِيتٌ, originally<br>\
عِفْرِيَةٌ, (S,) a rel. n. from بَرٌّ, (Sh, T, Msb,) A<br>\
desert; a waste; a spacious tract of ground<br>\
without herbage; syn. صَحْرَآءُ: (S, M, A, Msb,<br>\
K:) [see also بَرٌّ:] or a tract nearer to the desert<br>\
(البَرّ) than it is to water: (Sh, T:) [but some<br>\
write the latter word ↓ بِرِّيتٌ; and it is said that]<br>\
بِرِّيتُ, (T and K in art. برت,) of the same measure<br>\
as سِكِّيتٌ, (K in that art.,) signifies flat, even, or<br>\
level, land: (T, K:) or a barren, flat, even, or<br>\
level, land: a poet says,<br>\
بِرِّيتُ أَرْضٍ بَعْدَهَا بِرِّيتُ<br>\
[A barren, flat land, after which is a second<br>\
barren, flat land]: (T:) ISd says that بِرِّيتٌ, in<br>\
a poem of Ru-beh, [from which the ex. given<br>\
above is probably taken,] is of the measure فِعْلِيتٌ<br>\
from البَرُّ; and that art. برت is not the place in<br>\
which it should be mentioned: (TA:) Lth says,<br>\
البَرِّيتُ is a noun derived from البَرِّيَّةُ; the ى<br>\
becoming quiescent, and the ة becoming an inseparable ت, as though it were a radical letter, as<br>\
in the case of عِفْرِيَةٌ, which thus becomes عِفْرِيتٌ:<br>\
(T, TA:) the pl. of برّيّة is بَرَارِىُّ; and that of برّيت<br>\
is بَرَارِيتُ. (S.)<br>\
بَرِّيَّةٌ and بَرِّيتٌ and بِرِّيتٌ: see بَرِّىٌّ.<br>\
بَرَّارٌ as signifying A possessor of بُرّ, i. e. wheat,<br>\
though agreeable with prevailing analogy, is not<br>\
allowable, not being sanctioned by usage. (Sb,<br>\
M.)<br>\
بَرَّانِىٌّ External; or outward: apparent; public. (T.) Hence the saying of Selmán, (T,) مَنْ<br>\
أَصْلَحَ جَوَّانِيَّهُ أَصْلَحَ اللّٰهُ بَرَّانِيَّهُ (T, A, K) Whoso<br>\
maketh his inner man (سَرِيرَتَهُ) to be good, God<br>\
will make his outward man (عَلَانِيَتَهُ) to be good.<br>\
(T.) بَرَّانِىٌّ is a rel. n., irregularly formed, (K,)<br>\
from بَرٌّ signifying “ elevated ground, open to<br>\
view; ” and جَوَّانِىٌّ, from جَوٌّ signifying “ any<br>\
low, or depressed, part of the ground. ” (T.)<br>\
You say, افْتَتَحَ البَابَ البَرَّانِىَّ He opened the<br>\
outer door. (A.)<br>\
بَرْبَرُ, (S, K,) or البَرْبَرُ, (Mgh, Msb,) [a coll. gen.<br>\
proper name, of which the n. un., or rel. n., is<br>\
↓ بَرْبَرِىٌّ,] a foreign word, (S,) [probably of African<br>\
origin, the primary form of which is the source<br>\
of<br>\
βάρβαρο�, &amp;c.,] arabicized; (Msb;) or, as some<br>\
say, from بَرْبَرَةٌ in speech; (TA; [see R. Q. 1;])<br>\
and البَرَابِرَةُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) the pl. of بَرْبَرُ, (K,)<br>\
or of البَرْبَرُ, (Msb,) [or of بَرْبَرِىٌّ, agreeably with<br>\
what follows and with analogy,] the ة being<br>\
added because the sing. is a foreign word, or [so<br>\
in the M and TA, but in the S “ and,”] a rel. n.,<br>\
(S, M,) but it may be elided; [so that one may<br>\
say البَرَابِرُ;] (S;) A certain people, (S, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) of the inhabitants of El-Maghrib [or<br>\
Northern Africa west of Egypt], (Mgh, * Msb, K, *)<br>\
like the Arabs of the desert in hardness, and coarseness, or rudeness, (Mgh, * Msb,) and in slightness<br>\
of religion, and littleness of knowledge: (Mgh:)<br>\
and another people, [the Colobi mentioned by<br>\
Diodorus Siculus and Strabo,] between the Abyssinians and the Zinj, who amputate [the glans of]<br>\
the penis, and make it a dowry for a wife. (K.)<br>\
[There are various opinions of the origins of these<br>\
races. The appellation of البَرَابِرَةُ, sing. ↓ بَرْبَرِىٌّ, is<br>\
also applied by late historians, and in the present<br>\
day, to The races inhabiting the portion of the<br>\
valley of the Nile which we commonly call Nubia.]<br>\
