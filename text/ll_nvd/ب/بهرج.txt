than by, or in, the right way: (Msb:) or (tropical:)  it<br>\
was turned away, or conveyed by turning away,<br>\
(Kt, K, TA,) from the beaten way or road,<br>\
(Kt, TA,) or from the direct, or right, main<br>\

Q. 2<br>\
تَبَهْرَجَ It (a place) became, or was<br>\
made, free to the people in general to pasture<br>\
their beasts in it. (IAar, L.)<br>\
بَهْرَجٌ an arabicized word, (T, S, Mgh, L, TA,)<br>\
from نَبَهْرَهْ, (T, Mgh, L, TA,) which is Persian;<br>\
(L, TA;) or, as some say, it is an Indian word,<br>\
originally نَبَهْلَهْ, meaning Bad, whence the Persian<br>\
نَبَهْرَهْ, and hence the arabicized بَهْرَجٌ; (TA;) applied to a dirhem, as meaning bad; (Kr, S;)<br>\
false; (S, El-Marzookee;) adulterated; (Shifá<br>\
el-Ghaleel, El-Marzookee;) of bad silver; (A,<br>\
Mgh, L, Msb;) with which one cannot buy:<br>\
(IAar, TA:) or, as some say, in which the silver<br>\
is predominant: or, accord. to IAar, of which<br>\
the die has been falsified: (Mgh:) or not coined<br>\
in the government-mint: (Lb, TA:) and ↓ مُبْهَرَجٌ<br>\
signifies the same, applied to a dirhem; (Lh, A,<br>\
Mgh;) and so ↓ نَبَهْرَجٌ; (Lh, El-Marzookee;)<br>\
but [Mtr says,] I have not found it with ن, except on the authority of Lh (Mgh;) and IKh<br>\
says that it is a word of the vulgar: (TA:) the<br>\
pl. [of بهرج] is بَهَارِجُ, and [of نبهرج,] نَبَهْرَجَاتُ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, metaphorically, (Mgh,) (tropical:)  Bad;<br>\
(S, A, Mgh, L, Msb, K;) and false, or of no<br>\
account; (S, A, Mgh, K;) applied to a thing (S,<br>\
A, Mgh, L, Msb) of any kind: (A, Mgh, L:) anything rejected; not received or accepted; rejected<br>\
as wrong or bad; as also ↓ نَبَهْرَجٌ: (TA:) and a<br>\
thing is termed ↓ مُبَهْرَجٌ when it is as though it were<br>\
cast away, and not an object of emulous desire or<br>\
envy, or not in request. (El-Marzookee, TA.)<br>\
You say, كَلَامٌ بَهْرَجٌ (tropical:)  Bad language. (A, L.)<br>\
And عَمَلٌ بَهْرَجٌ (tropical:)  A bad action. (A, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Allowed or allowable [to any person, to be taken<br>\
or let alone, or to be possessed or made use of or<br>\
done]; made allowable, free, or lawful. (K.) You<br>\
say, دَمٌ بَهْرَجٌ (tropical:)  Blood made to be of no account,<br>\
to go for nothing, unretaliated, or uncompensated<br>\

in it. (IAar, L.) And ↓ مَآءٌ مُبَهْرَجٌ (assumed tropical:)  A water<br>\
