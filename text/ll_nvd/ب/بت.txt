بَتَّهُ, (Lth, T, S, M, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
بَتُ3َ and<br>\
بَتِ3َ, (S,<br>\
M, Msb,) the latter anomalous, because a reduplicative verb [of this kind] having the aor. with<br>\
kesr is not trans., except in certain instances, of<br>\
which this is one; the other instances being عَلَّهُ,<br>\
in relation to drinking, aor.<br>\
بَتُ3َ and<br>\
بَتِ3َ, and نَمَّ<br>\
الحَدِيثَ, aor.<br>\
بَتُ3َ and<br>\
بَتِ3َ, and شَدَّهُ, aor.<br>\
بَتُ3َ and<br>\
بَتِ3َ, and<br>\
حَبَّهُ, aor.<br>\
بَتِ3َ; the last having but one form [of<br>\
aor.]; (S;) inf. n. بَتٌّ: (Lth, T, S, M, A, &amp;c.:)<br>\
and ↓ ابتّهُ, (M,) inf. n. إِبْتَاتٌ: (Mgh, K:) He cut<br>\
it off, severed it, separated it, or disunited it,<br>\
(Lth, T, S, M, A, * Mgh, * Msb, K, *) entirely, or<br>\
utterly; (Lth, T, M;) namely, a thing; (M;)<br>\
a rope, or cord; (Lth, T;) and a tie, or bond, of<br>\
union between two persons. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [بَتَّهُ and<br>\
↓ ابتّهُ, accord. to the TA, app. signify also He, or<br>\
it, caused him (a man) to become unable to proceed in his journey, his camel that bore him<br>\
breaking down, or stopping from fatigue, or<br>\
perishing: for انبتّ as signifying “he became<br>\
so” is there said to be quasi-pass. of those two<br>\
verbs when it has this sense. Hence,] بَتَّهُ السَّفَرُ<br>\
[The journey caused him to become cut off, &amp;c.].<br>\
(A.) And سَاقَ دَابَّتَهُ حَتَّي بَتَّهَا [He urged on his<br>\
beast so that, or until, he caused it to become cut<br>\
off, &amp;c.]: (A:) and بَعِيرَهُ ↓ أَبَتَّ He caused his<br>\
camel to become cut off, &amp;c., (قَطَعَةُ,) by travel:<br>\
(M, TA:) this is not said but of a man who has<br>\
forced on his camel at a hard pace, or by laborious<br>\
journeying. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  بَتَّ طَلَاقَ امْرَأَتِهِ, (T, Msb,<br>\
TA,) or طَلَاقَ المَرْأَةِ, (Mgh,) and ↓ أَبَتَّهُ, (Lth, T,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) He made the divorce of his wife, or<br>\
of the woman, to be absolutely separating, (Lth,<br>\
T, Mgh, Msb, TA,) so as to cut her off from<br>\
return. (Msb.) Lth, with whom AZ agrees, has<br>\
erred in asserting that بَتَّ is intrans. and ↓ أَبَتّ<br>\
trans.: (T, TA:) both are trans. and intrans.,<br>\
(T, Msb, TA,) as En-Nawawee asserts in the<br>\
Tahdheeb el-Asmà wa-1-Loghát. (TA.) You say,<br>\
الطَّلْقَةُ الوَاحِدَةُ تَبُتُّ, and ↓ تُبِتُّ, i. e. The single<br>\
divorce cuts the matrimonial tie, or bond, of the<br>\
woman, (تَقْطَعُ عِصْمَةَ النِّكَاحِ, T, Mgh, *) when the<br>\
period during which she must wait before contracting a new marriage has ended. (T.) [See<br>\
also بَتٌّ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  بَتَّ عَلَيْهِ القَضَآءَ, (T, S, M, A,) inf. n.<br>\
بَتٌّ; (M;) and ↓ أَبَتَّهُ; (T, S, M;) He (the judge,<br>\
T) decided the judgment, or sentence, against him.<br>\
(T, S, * M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  بَتَّ عَلَيْهِ الشَّهَادَةَ, and ↓ أَبَتَّهَا, He<br>\
decided against him by the testimony, [or pronounced the testimony decisive against him,] and<br>\
compelled, or constrained, him to admit it. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  بَتَّ شَهَادَتَهُ, and ↓ أَبَتَّهَا, He gave his testimony<br>\
decisively. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b7-  أَبُتُّ أَنَّهُ قَالَ I know, or<br>\
declare, decidedly, not [merely] thinking it, that<br>\
he said thus. (Saheeh of Muslim.) ―<br>\
-b8-  بَتَّ النِّيَّةَ<br>\
He made the intention decided; or fixed it decidedly. (A.) It is said in a trad., لَا صِيَامَ لِمَنْ<br>\
الصّيَامِ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ ↓ لَمْ يُبِتَّ, (T, S, Mgh,) or لَمْ يَبُتَّ,<br>\
accord. to different recitals, (Mgh,) i. e. There is<br>\
no fasting to him [meaning his fasting is null]<br>\
who does not decisively impose it upon himself, by<br>\
intention, from the night: (S, * Mgh:) or, who<br>\
does not form the intention of fasting before daybreak, and thus cut it off from the time in which<br>\
there is no fasting, namely, the night: the intention<br>\
is termed بَتٌّ [and إِبْتَاتٌ] because it makes a division between non-fasting and fasting: (T, TA:)<br>\
لَمْ يُبِت, from الإِبَاتَةُ, is a mistake; but لم يُبَيِّت,<br>\
from التَّبْيِيتُ, [see بَيَّتَ,] is correct. (Mgh.) And<br>\
it is said in another trad., نِكَاحَ هٰذِهِ النِّسَآءِ ↓ أَبِتُّوا,<br>\
i. e. Decide ye the affair respecting the marriage<br>\
of these women, and confirm it by its [proper]<br>\
conditions: an oblique prohibition of the kind of<br>\
marriage termed نِكَاحُ المُتْعَةِ, because it is a marriage not [absolutely or lawfully] decided, [being]<br>\
made definite as to duration. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  بَتَّ also<br>\
signifies He made to have, or take, effect; he<br>\
executed, or performed; (Har p. 210;) and so<br>\
↓ ابتّ, as in the phrase, ابتّ يَمِينَهُ He made his<br>\
oath to have, or take, effect; he executed, or performed, it. (M.) ―<br>\
-b10-  سَكْرِانُ مَا يَبُتُّ كَلَامًا, (Ks,<br>\
T, M,) and ما يَبِتُّ, (M,) and ↓ ما يُبِتُّ, (Ks, T,<br>\
M,) One who is drunk, who does not speak<br>\
plainly, or distinctly; lit., who does not make<br>\
speech plain, or distinct; (Ks, T;) or who does<br>\
not articulate speech; syn. مَا يَقْطَعُهُ: (M:) or,<br>\
as As says, (T,) سَكْرَانُ مَا يَبُتُّ, (T, A,) or لَا يَبُتُّ,<br>\
(S, K,) and لا يَبِتُّ, and ↓ لا يُبَتُّ, (K,) which last<br>\
form of the verb is disallowed by As, but both are<br>\
correct accord. to Fr, (T, S,) meaning one who is<br>\
drunk, who does not, or will not, [i. e. cannot,]<br>\
decide an affair. (As, T, S, K.) [See also بَاتٌّ.]<br>\
-A2-  See also 7. ―<br>\

took, effect; was executed, or performed; syn.<br>\
وَجَبَتْ: (M:) it was, or proved, true: (Msb:)<br>\
a phrase mentioned by AZ, and, if correct, not<br>\
needing any explanation. (M.) [See ابتّ يَمِينَهُ,<br>\
above.]<br>\
-A3-  بَتَّ, aor.<br>\
بَتِ3َ, inf. n. بُتُوتٌ, He was, or<br>\
became, lean, or meagre. (M, K.) [See بَاتٌّ.]<br>\
-A4-  بَتٌّ [inf. n. of بَتَّ] also signifies The selling,<br>\
and the weaving, a [garment of the kind called]<br>\
طَيْلَسَان [or بَتّ, q. v.]. (KL.)<br>\
2<br>\
بتّتهُ, inf. n. تَبْتِيتٌ, He cut it off, or severed<br>\
it, [entirely, or utterly, and] much, or with extraordinary energy or effectiveness; the teshdeed<br>\
denoting intensiveness of signification. (S.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
بَتَّتُوهُ They furnished him with [بَتَات, or] travel-ling-provisions. (M, K.)<br>\
-A3-  بَتِّتْهُمْ Give thou to<br>\
them [garments called] بُتُوت [pl. of بَتُّ, q. v.].<br>\
(TA, from a trad.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَبْتَ3َ see 1, passim:<br>\
-A2-  and see 7.<br>\
5<br>\
تبتّت He became furnished with [بَتَات, or]<br>\
travelling provisions: and he became provided<br>\
with [بَتَات, or] utensils and furniture of the house<br>\
or tent; or household goods. (M, K, TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انبتّ It was, or became, cut off, severed,<br>\
separated, or disunited, (Lth, T, S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
entirely, or utterly; (Lth, T, M;) namely, a<br>\

tie, or bond, of union between two persons: (T,<br>\
M: *) as also ↓ بَتَّ, (Lth, AZ, T, M, Msb,) aor.<br>\
بَتِ3َ<br>\

بَتُ3َ, (M, [so accord. to a copy of that work,<br>\
but it seems to be indicated in the Msb (see 1,<br>\
near the close of the paragraph,) that it is<br>\
بَتِ3َ only,<br>\
in this case,]) inf. n. بَتٌّ; (Lth, AZ, T, M, K;)<br>\
and ↓ ابتّ, (T, Msb, TA,) inf. n. إِبْتَاتٌ; (T, TA;)<br>\
the last said by Lth and AZ to be trans. only;<br>\
(T, TA;) but it is both trans. and intrans., like<br>\
the second: (T, Msb, TA:) so says En-Nawawee,<br>\
as mentioned above: see 1. (TA.) You say,<br>\
اِنْقَطَعَ فُلَانٍ فَانْبَتَّ حَبْلُهُ عَنْهُ [Such a one<br>\
broke off, or disunited himself, from such a one,<br>\
and his tie, or bond, of union became severed from<br>\
him]. (T, TA, [but in a copy of the former, for<br>\
عن فلان, is put عَنْ مَالِهِ from his property.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
He became unable to proceed in his journey, his<br>\
camel that bore him breaking down, or stopping<br>\
from fatigue, or perishing: (A, * Mgh, * TA:)<br>\
quasi-pass. of بَتَّهُ and أَبَتَّهُ. (TA.) You say,<br>\
سَارَ حَتَّى انْبَتَّ He journeyed until he was unable<br>\
to proceed &amp;c. (A, Mgh, TA.) [See also مُنْبَتٌّ.]<br>\

[i. e. his seminal fluid,] became cut off, or stopped,<br>\
or ceased, (Ks, T, A, K,) by reason of age: (A:)<br>\
said of a man. (Ks, T, A.)<br>\
بَتٌّ inf. n. of 1, q. v. (Lth, T, S, M, &amp;c.) [It<br>\
is sometimes used as an inf. n.; as also ↓ بَتّةٌ and<br>\
↓ بَتَاتٌ, explained in the M as syn. with قَطْعٌ:<br>\
and sometimes, as is often the case with inf. ns.,<br>\
in the sense of the act. part. n. of its verb,<br>\
namely ↓ بَاتٌّ, trans. and intrans.; as also ↓ بَتَاتٌ;<br>\
both of which are masc. and fem., because originally inf. ns.; but بَتٌّ has also بَتَّةٌ for its fem.<br>\
The following are exs.] ―<br>\

-b3-  طَلَّقَهَا,<br>\
(Mgh, K,) and ↓ بَتَاتًا, (K,) and البَتَّةَ, (T,) and<br>\

said Juweyriyeh, or decidedly he said so]; as<br>\
though the speaker doubted of the female&#39;s name,<br>\
and said, “I think it was Juweyriyeh; ” then<br>\
corrected, and said, “or I know,” or “ declare,”<br>\
“ decidedly, (أَبُتُّ, i. e. أَقْطَعُ,) that he said Juweyriyeh: I do not [merely] think. ” (Saheeh of<br>\

-A2-  Travelling provisions:<br>\
(S, M, A, K:) and requisites, equipments, or furniture; syn. جَهَازٌ: (S, K:) pl. أَبِتَّةٌ. (S.) A<br>\
