vulgar Arabic بَبَغَان, The parrot;] a certain<br>\
well-known bird; (Msb;) a certain green bird,<br>\
(Sgh, K, TA,) well known; (TA;) the bird<br>\
called in Persian طُوطِي, beautiful in colour and<br>\
form, mostly green, but in some instances red,<br>\
and yellow, and white; having a thick bill and<br>\
tongue: it hears the speech of men and repeats<br>\
it, without knowing its meaning; and utters<br>\
letters rightly: when they desire to teach it,<br>\
they put a mirror in its cage, so that it sees<br>\
therein its own form, and they speak to it from<br>\
behind the mirror, and when it hears, it repeats,<br>\
desiring to do as its like; and thus it learns<br>\
quickly: one of the wonders relating to it is<br>\
[said to be this], that it never drinks water; for<br>\
if it drank, it would die: (Kzw:) the affix renders<br>\
fem. the word, but not the thing named thereby,<br>\
like the ة in حَمَامَةٌ and نَعَامَةٌ; for the word<br>\
applies to the male and the female, so that<br>\
one says, بَبْغَآءُ ذَكَرٌ [a male parrot] and بَبْغَآءُ أُنْثَى<br>\
[a female parrot]: and the pl. is بَبْغَاوَاتٌ [or<br>\
بَبَّغَاوَاتٌ], like as صَحْرَاوَتٌ is pl. of صَحْرَآءُ.<br>\
