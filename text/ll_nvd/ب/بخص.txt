بَخَصَ عَيْنَهُ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
بَخَصَ,<br>\
(S, Mgh, K,) inf. n. بَخْصٌ, (S, Mgh,) He put out<br>\
his eye; syn. فَقَأَهَا, (Mgh,) and عَوَّرَهَا: (A, Mgh:)<br>\
or he pulled out his eye [altogether, i. e.,] with its<br>\
bulb: (S, K: [in the former, مَعض شَحْمَتِهَا: in the<br>\
latter, not so well, بِشَحْمِهَا:]) or he put his finger<br>\
into his eye: (Msb:) Yaakoob says that you<br>\
should not say بَخَسَ; (S;) and so says ISk:<br>\
(TA in art. بخس:) but accord. to As, as related<br>\
by Aboo-Turáb, you say بَخَصَ عَيْنَهُ and بَخَزَهَا<br>\
and بَخَسَهَا, all as meaning he put out his eye;<br>\
syn. فَقَأَهَا: (TA:) and IAar says that بَخَسَهَا and<br>\
بَخَصَهَا signify alike: (Msb:) the former of these<br>\
two is a dial. var. of the latter; (TA in art. بخس;)<br>\
and signifies he put it out (فَقَأَهَا) with his finger<br>\
or some other thing: (Lth, As, and K in art.<br>\
بخس:) but بَخَصَ is the better word. (Lh, IAar,<br>\
Msb.)<br>\
