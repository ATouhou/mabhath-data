بَقَرَ, (S, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
بَقُرَ, (JK, S, A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) or<br>\
بَقَرَ, (K,) [but this seems to be a mistake,]<br>\
inf. n. بَقْرٌ, (S, Msb,) He slit; ripped; split;<br>\
cut, or divided, lengthwise. (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.) He<br>\
slit, or ripped open, an animal&#39;s belly. (A, Mgh.)<br>\
One says, اُبْقُرْهَا عَنْ جَنِينِهَا Rip thou open her<br>\
[a camel&#39;s] belly so as to disclose her fœtus. (S.)<br>\
[See بَقِيرٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  He opened, or laid open. (S, A,<br>\
Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He widened; made wide, or ample.<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He opened, and widened, or made<br>\
wide, a house, or tent. (TA, from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
He opened and revealed to a person a story.<br>\
(TA, from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b6-  بَقَرَ الأَرْضَ said of a هُدْهُد<br>\
[or hoopoe], It looked for the place of water and<br>\
saw it: (K:) [or it clave the ground and discovered water:] occurring in a trad. respecting<br>\
the هدهد of Solomon [mentioned in the Kur<br>\
ch. xxvii.] (T.) ―<br>\
-b7-  بَقَرَ فِى بَنِى فُلَانٍ He knew<br>\
the state, condition, case, or affair, of the sons of<br>\
such a one, and examined, or inspected, them.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b8-  بَقَرَ عَنِ العُلُومِ He inquired, and searched<br>\
to the utmost, after sciences. (A.) ―<br>\
-b9-  بَقَرَ العِلْمَ:<br>\
see 5.<br>\
-A2-  بَقِرَ, aor.<br>\
بَقَرَ, He (a dog) became confounded, (S, K,) and stupified, (TA,) with joy,<br>\
(K,) at seeing بَقَر, (S, K,) i. e., بَقَر الوَحْش [wild<br>\
oxen, or wild bulls or cows]; (TA;) like as one<br>\
says غَزِلَ meaning “ he sported,” or “ played,”<br>\
“ at seeing a gazelle,” or “ a young gazelle; ” as<br>\
also ↓ بَيْقَرَ: or the former, he feared, so that he<br>\
was astonished, amazed, or stupified, at seeing<br>\
many بَقَر: (TA voce بَحِزَ:) and ↓ the latter signifies also [simply] he became confounded, or perplexed: (IAar, TA:) and he doubted respecting<br>\
a thing. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, aor. as above, inf. n. بَقَرٌ<br>\
(S, K) and بَقْرٌ; (K;) but Az says, El-Mundhiree<br>\
has informed me that A Heyth disallowed بَقْرٌ,<br>\
saying that it is accord. to analogy بَقَرٌ, as the<br>\
verb is intrans.; (TA;) He (a man) became tired,<br>\
or fatigued, (S, K,) so that he could hardly see;<br>\
(K;) and he became weary, or jaded; (S, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ بَيْقَرَ. (S, K. *)<br>\

بقّر القَوْمُ مَا حَوْلَهُمْ The people dug the tract<br>\
around them, and made wells. (As.)<br>\

تبقّر It (a she-camel&#39;s belly) became ripped<br>\
open; as also ↓ ابتقر and ↓ انبقر. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It<br>\
became open. (As.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And i. q. توسّع; (As, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ تَبَيْقَرَ. (K.) So in the phrase تبقّر فِى<br>\
العِلْمِ [He enlarged himself, or took a wide range,<br>\
in science, or knowledge]; (S, A, Msb;) and<br>\
العِلْمَ ↓ بَقَرَ, inf. n. بَقْرٌ, signifies the same. (TA.)<br>\
And so in the phrase تبقّر فِى المَالِ, (S, A, Msb,)<br>\
and فى الأَهْلِ, (TA,) i. e., He enlarged himself,<br>\
or he became, or made himself, large, or abundant, in wealth, or camels or the like, and in<br>\
family; as explained by As. (A&#39;Obeyd.) You<br>\
say also, تبقّر الكَلَامَ, [meaning فِى الكَلَامِ,] i. e.,<br>\
He was diffuse, or profuse, in speech; syn. تَفَتَّقَ<br>\
بِهِ. (A.)<br>\

بَقَرٌ a gen. n., (S, Msb,) a word of well-known<br>\
meaning, (S, Msb, K,) [The bovine genus; the<br>\
ox, or bull, and cow; and oxen, or bulls, and<br>\
cows; neat; black cattle;] applied to the domestic and the wild: (TA:) [but the wild have also<br>\
distinctive appellations, as will be seen below:]<br>\
n. un. بَقَرَةٌ, (S, Msb, K, [but in the K it is said<br>\
that بَقَرٌ is pl. of بَقَرَةٌ,]) which is applied to the<br>\
male and the female; (S, Msb, K;) the ة being<br>\
added only to restrict it to unity: (S, Msb:)<br>\
the pl. of بَقَرٌ is أَبْقُرٌ [a pl. of pauc.]; (M,) and<br>\
أَبْقَارٌ, meaning herds of oxen, or bulls, or cows:<br>\
(Msb and TA in art. ابل:) and the pl. of بَقَرَةٌ<br>\
is بَقَرَاتٌ (S, Msb, K) and بُقُرٌ and بُقَّارٌ (K) and<br>\
بَوَاقِرُ (As, T, K) and ↓ أُبْقُورٌ; (K;) [or rather<br>\
this last is a quasi-pl. n.;] and the following<br>\
[also] are quasi-pl. ns., namely, ↓ بَيْقُورٌ, (K,)<br>\
which is syn. with بَقَرٌ, (S,) and ↓ بَقِيرٌ, (K,) or<br>\
this signifies a collection, or herd, of بَقَر, (S,)<br>\
and ↓ بَاقِرٌ, (K,) or this signifies a collection, or<br>\
herd, of بَقَر with their pastors, (Lth, S,) and<br>\
↓ بَاقُورٌ, and ↓ بَاقُورَةٌ, (K,) or this last is syn. with<br>\
بَقَرَةٌ in the dial. of the people of El-Yemen: (S:)<br>\
or ↓ بَاقُورٌ and ↓ يَبْقُورٌ and ↓ أُبْقُورٌ are all syn. with<br>\
بَقَرٌ; and so, accord. to Ktr, is ↓ بَاقُورَةٌ. (Mgh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  بَقَرُ الوَحْشِ [and البَقَرُ الوَحْشِىُّ signify The<br>\
wild ox, or bull, and cow; and wild oxen, or<br>\
bulls, and cows, collectively: n. un. بَقَرَةُ الوَحْشِ<br>\
and البَقَرَةُ الوَحْشِيَّةُ; masc. and fem.: in Egypt,<br>\
these appellations are applied to the antilope defassa of modern zoologists: so says Sir Gardner<br>\
Wilkinson; and to this, I believe, they generally<br>\
apply in the poems &amp;c. of the early Arabs: it is<br>\
a species of bovine antelope: in Barbary, it seems<br>\
that the animal thus called is another species<br>\
of bovine antelope, or perhaps a variety of the<br>\
former; it is said to be what is termed by Pallas<br>\
antilope bubalis; by others, alcephalus bubalis,<br>\
or acronotus bubalis; and this is said to come<br>\
occasionally to the Nile: but the Arabic appellations given above are employed with much laxity:<br>\
thus we find بَقَرُ الوَحْشِ explained as meaning] a<br>\
kind of animal of which there are four different<br>\
species: the first called مِهِا [i. e. مَهًا, a coll. gen. n.<br>\
of which the n. un. is مَهَاةٌ]; the second, ايل [i. e.<br>\
إِيَّلٌ]; the third يحمور [i. e. يَحْمُورٌ], or يامور<br>\
[i. e. يَأْمُورٌ]; the fourth, ثيثل [or ثَيْتَلٌ], and also<br>\
وعل [i. e. وَعْلٌ]: (Ed-Demeeree, cited by De<br>\
Sacy, erroneously written by him “ Domaïri,”<br>\
in his Chrest. Ar. sec. ed. ii. 435 et seq.:) or<br>\
what is called in Persian كوزن [or گَوَزْنْ (see<br>\
also إِيَّلٌ in art. اول)]; it has a great horn, with<br>\
branches; an additional branch growing upon<br>\
its horn every year; and its horn is solid, thus<br>\
differing from the horns of other animals, for<br>\
their horns are hollow: when it hears singing,<br>\
and the sounds of musical instruments, it listens<br>\
thereto, and then it takes no care to guard itself<br>\
from the arrows, by reason of its intense delight<br>\
therein: when it raises its ear, it hears sounds;<br>\
and when it relaxes it, it hears not anything.<br>\
(Kzw: also cited by De Sacy, ubi suprà.) The<br>\
Arabs regard بَقَر [meaning بقر الوحش] as ominous<br>\
of evil, because of the sharpness of their horns.<br>\
(Ham p. 285.) ―<br>\
-b3-  مِلْءُ مَسْكِ البَقَرَةِ [The quantity<br>\
that fills the hide of the bull, or cow,] means (tropical:) a<br>\
large quantity. (A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  الظِّبَآءَ عَلَى البَقَرِ [or<br>\
الظِّبَآءُ] and الكِرَابَ عَلَى البَقَرِ [or الكِرَابُ, and الكِلَابَ<br>\
or الكِلَابُ,] are provs. of the Arabs. (TA.) [See<br>\
arts. ظبي and كرب and كلب.] ―<br>\
-b5-  عَيْنُ البَقَرِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [The buphthalmum, or ox-eye;] i. q. بَهَارٌ, q. v.<br>\
(S in art. بهر.) ―<br>\
-b6-  عُيُونُ البَقَرِ (tropical:)  A species of grape,<br>\
black, large, round, and not very sweet. (K, TA.)<br>\
In Palestine, applied to (tropical:)  A species of إِجَّاص [or<br>\
plum]. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  بَقَرٌ is also applied to (tropical:)  A<br>\
family, or household; those who dwell with a<br>\
man, and whose maintenance is incumbent on<br>\
him. (TA.) You say, جَاءَ فُلَانٌ يَجُرُّ بَقَرَهُ (tropical:)  Such<br>\
a one came dragging along his family, or household. (A, * TA.) And عَلَى فُلَانٍ بَقَرَةٌ مِنْ عِيَالٍ<br>\
وَمَالٍ (tropical:)  Upon such a one is dependent a troop, or<br>\

(tropical:)  Such a one is among a large company of men.<br>\

(S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A mare&#39;s colt or foal that is born in a<br>\
[membrane such as is called] مَاسِكَةٌ or سَلًى:<br>\
(K:) so termed because this is ripped open over<br>\
it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, and ↓ بَقِيرَةٌ, A garment of the<br>\
kind called بُرْد, which is slit [in the middle], and<br>\
worn (As, K) by a woman, who throws it upon<br>\
her neck, [putting her head through the slit,]<br>\
(As,) without sleeves, (As, K,) and without a<br>\
