load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'برثنبُرْثُنٌ, of the lion, (AZ, T,) and of any animal<br>\
of prey, (AZ, As, T, S, M, K,) and of birds, (As,<br>\
S,) [The toe; i. e.] what corresponds to the إِصْبَع<br>\
of a man; (AZ, As, T, S, M, K;) [in the Lex.<br>\
of Golius, as on the authority of the S, and in<br>\
that of Freytag, idem quod انملة in homine; but<br>\
this is a mistake, app. occasioned by a mistranscription in a copy of the S;] and the مِخْلَب is<br>\
its claw, i. e., nail: (AZ, As, T, S:) or the paw<br>\
(كَفّ), (M, K,) altogether, (M,) with the أَصَابِع<br>\
[or toes]: (M, K:) or the claw, i. e. nail, of the<br>\
lion, (Lth, T, M, K,) likened to the instrument<br>\
for perforating leather; (Lth, T;) and of [all]<br>\
animals of prey, and of birds that do not prey,<br>\
corresponding to the ظُفْر of man: Th says, of<br>\
man, it is [termed] the ظُفْر; of animals having<br>\
the kind of foot called خُفّ, the مَنْسِمْ; of solidhoofed animals, the حَافِر; of cloven-hoofed animals,<br>\
the ظِلْف; of beasts and birds of prey, the مِخْلَب;<br>\
and of birds that do not prey, and of dogs and the<br>\
like, the بُرْثُن; though it may be also used [in like<br>\
manner] of all animals of prey: (Msb:) [but<br>\
properly] it is of birds that do not prey, as the<br>\
crow-kind, and the pigeon; (M;) and sometimes,<br>\
of the [lizard called] ضَبّ, (S, M,) and of the rat,<br>\
or mouse, and of the jerboa: (M:) and is, in the<br>\
pl. form, (M, TA,) which is بَرَاثِنُ, (T, S, M,<br>\
TA,) metaphorically applied, by Sá&#39;ideh Ibn-Jueiyeh, to the fingers of a man gathering honey<br>\
[deposited by wild bees in a hollow of a rock].<br>\
(M, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بُرْثُنُ الأَسَدِ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A certain<br>\
brand, or mark made with a hot iron, upon<br>\
camels, (K, TA,) in the form of the claw of the<br>\
lion. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  This, also, is the name of a sword<br>\
of Marthad Ibn-&#39;Alas. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [بُرْثُنَةٌ seems to<br>\
signify the same as بُرْثُنٌ or بَرَاثِنُ: for] Temeem<br>\
are termed in a trad. the بُرْثُمَة and بُرْجُمَة of the<br>\
tribes of Mudar; and El-Khattábee says that it<br>\
should be the بُرْثُنَة, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [The claw, or] the<br>\
claws; meaning thereby their impetuous valour,<br>\
and strength: but برثمة may be a dial. var. of<br>\
برثنة, or the م may be substituted for the ن for<br>\
the purpose of assimilation [to برجمة]. (TA.)<br>\
