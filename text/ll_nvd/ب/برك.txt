بَرَكَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
بَرُكَ, (S, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
بُرُوكٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and تَبْرَاكٌ, (K,) said of<br>\
a camel, (S, Mgh, Msb,) i. q. اِسْتَنَاخَ [i. e. He<br>\
lay down, or kneeled and lay down, upon his<br>\
breast, with his legs folded]; (S, K;) he made<br>\
his breast to cleave to the ground; (Mgh;) he<br>\
fell upon his بَرْك, i. e. breast; (Msb;) he threw<br>\
his برك, i. e. breast, upon the ground; (TA;)<br>\
and in like manner, ↓ برّك, (TA, and so in some<br>\
copies of the K,) inf. n. تَبْرِيكٌ. (TA.) And<br>\
بَرَكَتِ النَّعَامَةُ The ostrich lay upon its breast.<br>\
(TA.) And بَرَكَ is also said of a lion, and of a<br>\
man. (K voce ربض.) [Of the latter, one also<br>\
says, بَرَكَ عَلَى رُكْبَتَيْهِ He fell, or set himself,<br>\
upon his knees; he kneeled.] The بُرُوك of a man<br>\
praying, which is forbidden, is The putting down<br>\
the hands before the knees, after the manner of<br>\
the camel [when he lies down; for the latter falls<br>\
first upon his knees, and then upon his stiflejoints]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, i. e., from the verb<br>\
said of a camel, inf. n. بُرُوكٌ, (TA,) He, or it,<br>\
(i. e. anything, S,) was, or became, firm, steady,<br>\
steadfast, or fixed; continued, remained, or stayed;<br>\
(S, K;) in a place: (TK:) [and so, app., with<br>\
بَرِكَ<br>\
for its aor.; for] you say, بَرَكَ لِلْقِتَالِ, aor.<br>\
بَرِكَ, [He<br>\
was, or became, firm, &amp;c., for the purpose of<br>\
fighting,] and in like manner بَرِكَ, aor.<br>\
بَرَكَ. (TA.<br>\
[See also a similar signification of 8.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  It<br>\
(the night) was, or became, long, or protracted;<br>\
as though it did not quit its place. (A and TA<br>\
in art. قعس.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 8, in two places.<br>\
2<br>\
بَرَّكَ see 1.<br>\
-A2-  تَبْرِيكٌ also signifies The praying<br>\
for بَرَكَة, (S, K, TA,) for a man, &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
You say, بَرَّكْتُ عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. تَبْرِيكٌ, I said to<br>\
him, بَارَكَ اللّٰهَ عَلَيْكَ [or فِيكَ &amp;c., God bless thee!<br>\
&amp;c.]. (TA.) And برّك علي الطَّعَامِ He prayed<br>\
for, or invoked, a blessing on the food. (TK.)<br>\
3<br>\
بارك عَلَيْهِ He kept, or applied himself, constantly, or perseveringly, to it; (Lh, K;) namely,<br>\
an affair, (TA in art. حفظ,) or commerce, or<br>\
traffic, &amp;c. (Lh, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  بارك اللّٰهُ فِيكَ, (Fr, S,<br>\
Msb, K,) and لَكَ, and عَلَيْكَ, (S, K,) and بَارَكَكَ,<br>\
(Fr, S, K,) inf. n. مُبَارَكَةٌ, (TK,) [God bless,<br>\
beatify, felicitate, or prosper, thee;] God put<br>\
in thee, (TA,) give thee, make thee to possess,<br>\
(T, K,) بَرَكَة [i. e. a blessing, good of any kind,<br>\
prosperity or good fortune, increase, &amp;c.]. (TA,<br>\
TK.) بَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمِّدٍ وَ عَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ (in a<br>\
trad., TA,) means Continue Thou, or perpetuate<br>\
Thou, (O God,) to Mohammad and to the family<br>\
of Mohammad the eminence and honour which<br>\
Thou hast given them: (K, TA:) [or still bless<br>\
or beatify, or continue to bless or beatify, Mohammad &amp;c.: though it may well be rendered simply<br>\
bless or beatify &amp;c.:] Az says that it is from<br>\
بَرَكَ said of a camel, meaning “he lay down upon<br>\
his breast in a place and clave thereto.” (TA.)<br>\
And اَللّٰهُمَ بَارِكْ لَنَا فِى المَوْتِ, in another trad.,<br>\
means [O God, bless us] in the state to which<br>\
death will bring us. (TA.) The Arabs say to<br>\
the beggar, بُورِكَ فِيكَ [Mayest thou be blest;<br>\
and, in the present day, اَللّٰه يُبَارِك فِيك God bless<br>\
thee]; meaning thereby to repel him; not to<br>\
pray for him: and by reason of frequency of<br>\
usage of this phrase, they have made ↓ بُورِك a<br>\
noun: a poet [in Har شريش العدوى (app. Sherees,<br>\
not Shereesh, El-&#39;Adawee), in the TA Aboo-Fir&#39;own,] says,<br>\
تَظُنُّ أَنَّ بُورِكًا يَكْفِينِى<br>\
إِذَا خَرَجْتُ بَاسِطًا يَمِينِى<br>\
[She imagines that the saying “Mayest thou be<br>\
blest” will suffice me when I go forth stretching<br>\
out my right hand for an alms]. (Har p. 378.<br>\
[This verse is differently cited in the TA; for there,<br>\
instead of تظنّ and خرجت, we find تُحِبُّ and<br>\
غَدَوْتُ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [You also say of a man, بارك فِيهِ,<br>\
and لَهُ, &amp;c., meaning He blessed him; i. e. he<br>\
prayed God to bless him.] ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 6.<br>\
4<br>\
ابركهُ He made him (namely, a camel,) to<br>\
lie down [or kneel and lie down] upon his breast.<br>\
(S, K.) You say, أَبْرَكْتُهُ فَبَرَكَ I made him to<br>\
lie down upon his breast, and he lay down upon<br>\
his breast: but this is rare: the more common<br>\
phrase is أَنْخَتُهُ فَاسْتَنّاخَ. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 8.<br>\
-A3-<br>\
مَا أَبْرَكَهُ [How blessed is he, or it!] is an instance<br>\
of a verb of wonder with a passive meaning [and<br>\
irregularly derived]. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تبرّك بِهِ i. q. تَيَمَّنَ بِهِ [He had a blessing;<br>\
and he was, or became, blest; by means of him,<br>\
or it: so accord. to explanations of تَبَرُّكْ in the<br>\
KL: but very often signifying he looked for a<br>\
blessing by means of him, or it; he regarded him,<br>\
or it, as a means of obtaining a blessing; he<br>\
augured good from him, or it; تيمّن به being<br>\
opposed to تَشَأَّمَ به; as in the K in art. طير, and<br>\
in Bd in xvii. 14, &amp;c.]: (S, K:) and ↓ تبارك<br>\
بِالشَّيْءِ He augured good from the thing. (Lth,<br>\
K.) One says so of a man. (K in art. مسح.)<br>\
And one says, تبرّك بِاسْمِ اللّٰهِ [He looked for a<br>\
blessing by means of uttering the name of God,<br>\
or saying بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ]. (Ksh, on the بسملة; &amp;c.)<br>\
6<br>\
تبارك, accord. to Zj, is an instance of تَفَاعَلَ<br>\
[as quasi-pass. of فَاعَلَ, i. e., of بَارَكَ, like as تَبَاعَدَ<br>\
is of بَاعَدَ,] from البَرَكَةُ; and so say the lexicologists [in general]. (TA.) [Hence,] تبارك اللّٰهُ<br>\
means [Blessed is, or be, God; or] hallowed is,<br>\
or be, God; or far removed is, or be, He from<br>\
every impurity or imperfection, or from everything<br>\
derogatory from his glory; (K) or highly to<br>\
be exalted, or extolled, is God; or highly exalted,<br>\
or extolled, be He; (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, TA;) greatly<br>\
to be magnified is God; or greatly magnified be<br>\
He: (TA:) or i. q. ↓ بَارَكَ, like قَاتَلَ and تَقاَتَلَ,<br>\
except that فَاعَلَ is trans. and تَفَاَعَلَ is intrans.:<br>\
(S:) accord. to IAmb, it means [that] one looks<br>\
for a blessing by means of [uttering] his name<br>\
(يُتَبَرَّكُ بِاسْمِهِ) in every affair, or case: accord.<br>\
to Lth, it is a phrase of glorification and magnification: (TA:) or تبارك signifies He is abundant<br>\
in good; from البَرَكَةُ, which is “abundance of<br>\
good:” or He exceeds everything, and is exalted<br>\
above it, in his attributes and his operations;<br>\
because البَرَكَةُ implies the meaning of increase,<br>\
accession, or redundance: or He is everlasting;<br>\
syn. دَامَ; from بُرُوكُ الطَّيْرِ عَلَى المَآءِ [“the continuing of the birds at the water”]; whence<br>\
البِرْكَةُ, because of the continuance of the water<br>\
therein: the verb is invariable [when thus used,<br>\
being considered as divested of all signification<br>\
of time, or used in an optative sense]; and is not<br>\
employed [in any of the senses above] otherwise<br>\
than in relation to God: (Bd in xxv. 1:) it is an<br>\
attributive peculiar to God. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تبارك بِالشَّىْءِ:<br>\
see 5.<br>\
8<br>\
ابترك He (a man) threw his بَرْك [i. e. breast<br>\
upon the ground (as the camel does in lying<br>\
down), or upon some other thing]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He<br>\
(a sword-polisher) leaned upon the polishing-instrument, (K,) on one side. (TA.) And He (a<br>\
horse) inclined on one side in his running. (TA:<br>\
[accord. to which, this is from what next follows.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  He hastened, or sped, and strove, laboured,<br>\
or exerted himself, in running: (S, K:) and<br>\
↓ بَرَكَ, inf. n. بُرُوكٌ, (K,) or, as some say, this is<br>\
a subst. from the former verb, (TA,) He strove,<br>\
laboured, or exerted himself. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  It (a<br>\
cloud) rained continually, or incessantly: (TA:)<br>\
and ابتركت السَّمَآءُ (assumed tropical:)  the sky rained continually;<br>\
as also ↓ بَرَكَت, (K,) and ↓ ابركت; but Sgh<br>\
says that the first of these three is the most<br>\
correct. (TA.) And ابتركت السَّحَابَةُ (tropical:)  The cloud<br>\
rained vehemently. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  ابترك فِى عِرْضِهِ,<br>\
and عَلَيْهِ, (tropical:)  He detracted from his reputation,<br>\
censured him, or impugned his character, and<br>\
reviled him, (K, TA,) and laboured in vituperating him. (TA.) ابتركوا فِى الحَرْبِ (tropical:)  They<br>\
fell upon their knees in battle, and so fought one<br>\
another. (K, TA. [See بَرَكَآءُ, below.])<br>\
-A2-  اِبْتَرَكْتُهُ<br>\
I prostrated him, or threw him down prostrate,<br>\
and put him beneath my بَرْك [i. e. breast]. (S.)<br>\
بَرْكٌ Many camels: (S, K:) or a herd of<br>\
camels lying down upon their breasts: (K:) or<br>\
any camels, males and females, lying down upon<br>\
their breasts by the water or in the desert by<br>\
reason of the heat of the sun or by reason of<br>\
satiety: (TA:) or all the camels of the people<br>\
of an encampment, that return to them from<br>\
pasture in the evening, or afternoon, to whatever<br>\
number they may amount, even if they be thousands: (K:) one thereof is termed ↓ بَارِكٌ; (K;)<br>\
the two words being like تَجْرٌ and تَاجِرٌ; (TA;)<br>\
fem. ↓ بَارِكَةٌ: (K:) pl. بُرُوكٌ, (S, K,) i. e., pl.<br>\
of بَرْكٌ. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, (S, Msb, K,) and ↓ بِرْكَةٌ,<br>\
which is with kesr, (S, K,) The breast (S, Msb,<br>\
K) of a camel: (Msb, TA:) this is the primary<br>\
signification: (TA:) as some say, the former<br>\
signifies the breast of the camel with which he<br>\
crushes a thing beneath it: (TA:) and (K)<br>\
accord. to Lth, (TA,) the latter is the part next<br>\
to the ground of the skin of the breast of the<br>\
camel; (or, as in the &#39;Eyn, of the skin of the<br>\
belly of the camel and of the portion of the breast<br>\
next to it; TA;) as also the former: (K:) or, as<br>\
some say, the former is the middle of the breast,<br>\
where [the two prominences of flesh called] the<br>\
فَهْدَتَانِ conjoin at their upper parts: (Ham<br>\
p. 66:) or the latter is pl. of the former, like<br>\
as حِلْيَةٌ is of حَلْىٌ: or the former is of man;<br>\
and the latter, of others: or the former is the<br>\
interior of the breast; (or, as Yaakoob says, the<br>\
middle of the breast; TA;) and the latter, the<br>\
exterior thereof: (K:) or the former is the<br>\
breast, primarily of the camel, because camels lie<br>\
down (تَبْرُكُ) upon the breast; and metaphorically<br>\
of others. (Ham p. 145.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, بَرْك الشِّتَآءِ<br>\
(tropical:)  The first part of winter; (L, TA; *) and the<br>\
main part thereof. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And hence, (TA,)<br>\
البُرُوكُ is an appellation applied to (tropical:)  The stars<br>\
composing the constellation of the Scorpion, of<br>\
which are الزُّبَانَى and الإِكْلِيلُ and القَلْبُ and<br>\
الشَّوْلَةُ [the 16th and 17th and 18th and 19th of<br>\
the Mansions of the Moon], which rise [aurorally]<br>\
in the time of intense cold; as is also الجُثُومُ: (L,<br>\
TA: *) or, accord. to IF, to a نَوْء of the أَنْوَآء<br>\
of الجَوْزَآء; because the انواء thereof do not set<br>\
[aurorally] without there being during their period<br>\
a day and a night in which the camels lie upon<br>\
their breasts (تَبْرُكُ) by reason of the vehemence<br>\
of the cold and rain. (TA.)<br>\
بُرْكٌ: see بُرَكٌ.<br>\
بِرْكٌ: see بِرْكَةٌ.<br>\
بُرَكٌ Remaining fixed (↓ بَارِكٌ) at, or by, a thing.<br>\
(IAar, K.) So in the phrase بُرَكُ عَلَى جَنْب الإِنَآءِ<br>\
[Remaining fixed at, or by, the side of the vessel],<br>\
in a verse describing a [gluttonous] man, who<br>\
swallows closely-consecutive mouthfuls. (IAar.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  Incubus, or nightmare; as also ↓ بَارُوكٌ. (K.)<br>\

بُرْكَانٌ and بِرْكَانٌ and [pl. of pauc.] أَبْرَاكٌ; (K;)<br>\
or, in the opinion of ISd, ابراك and بركان are<br>\
pls. of the pl. [بُرَكٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
بِرْكَةٌ A mode, or manner, of بُرُوك [i. e. of a<br>\
camel&#39;s kneeling and lying down upon the breast];<br>\
(S, * O, * K;) a noun like رِكْبَةٌ and جِلْسَةٌ. (S,<br>\
O.) One says, مَا أَحْسَنَ بِرْكَةَ هٰذِهِ النَّاقَةِ [How<br>\
good is this she-camel&#39;s manner of lying down on<br>\
the breast!]. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  See also بَرْكٌ.<br>\
-A3-  A حَوْض<br>\
[i. e. watering-trough or tank]: (K:) or the like<br>\

the ground; (TA;) and ↓ بِرْكٌ signifies the same:<br>\
(Lth, K:) said to be so called because of the<br>\
continuance of the water therein: (S:) pl. بِرَكٌ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) which Az found to be applied by the<br>\
Arabs to the tanks, or cisterns, that are constructed with baked bricks, and plastered with<br>\
lime, in the road to Mekkeh, and at its wateringplaces; sing. بِرْكَةٌ; and sometimes a بركة is a<br>\
thousand cubits [in length], and less, and more:<br>\
but the watering-troughs, or tanks, that are made<br>\
for the rain-water, and not cased with baked<br>\
bricks, are called أَصْنَاعٌ, sing. صِنْعٌ: (TA:) [بِرْكَةٌ<br>\
often signifies a basin; a pool; a pond; and a<br>\
lake: and in the present day, also a bay of the<br>\
sea: and a reach of a river:] also a place where<br>\
water remains and collects, or collects and stagnates, or remains long and becomes altered. (ISd,<br>\
K.)<br>\
بَرَكَةٌ [A blessing; any good that is bestowed<br>\
by God; and particularly such as continues and<br>\
increases and abounds:] good, (Jel in xi. 50,) or<br>\
prosperity, or good fortune, (Fr, K,) that proceeds from God: (Fr, in explanation of the pl. as<br>\
used in the Kur xi. 76:) increase; accession;<br>\
redundance; abundance, or plenty; (S, Msb, K,<br>\
Kull;) whether sensible or intellectual: and the<br>\

fortune, increase, &amp;c.]; (Msb;) abounding in<br>\
good; (Ksh and Bd in iii. 90;) abounding in<br>\
advantage or utility: (Bd in vi. 92 and 156, and<br>\
xxxviii. 28, and 1. 9:) the pl. applied to irrational<br>\
things is مُبَارَكَاتٌ. (Msb.) You say also ↓ بَرِيكٌ<br>\
as meaning مُبَارَكَ فِيهِ: (K:) or طَعَامٌ بَرِيكٌ is as<br>\
though meaning مُبَارَكٌ [i. e. Blessed food; or food<br>\
in which is a blessing, &amp;c.]. (S.)<br>\
