بُهِتَ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) the most chaste form<br>\
of the verb in the sense here following, (S, TA,)<br>\
and that which most commonly obtains, and the<br>\
only form allowed by Th and IKt; (TA;) and<br>\
بَهِتَ, (S, L, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
بَهَتَ; (Msb, K;) and<br>\
بَهُتَ, (S, L, Msb, K,) in which the dammeh is<br>\
said to give intensiveness to the signification, as<br>\
in قَضُوَ الرَّجُلُ, (TA,) aor.<br>\
بَهُتَ; (Msb, K;) and<br>\
بَهَتَ, aor.<br>\
بَهُتَ (K) and<br>\
بَهَتَ; (TA;) inf. n. بَهْتٌ;<br>\
(JK, K;) He was, or became, confounded, perplexed, or amazed, and unable to see his right<br>\
course; (JK, S, Msb, K;) not knowing what to<br>\
prefer nor what to postpone: (TA in art. اشر:)<br>\
he looked at a thing that he saw with a look of<br>\
wonder: (A, TA:) he was, or became, affected<br>\
with wonder: (JK:) he was, or became, cut<br>\
short, (انْقَطَعَ, K, TA,) and was silent, being confounded, or perplexed, and unable to see his<br>\
right course: (TA:) he (an adversary in a dispute or litigation) was overcome by an argument,<br>\
an allegation, or a plea. (L.) All these forms<br>\
occur in different readings of the saying in the<br>\
Kur [ii. 260], فَبُهِتَ الَّذِى كَفَرَ and فَبَهِتَ &amp;c.,<br>\
(IJ, TA,) explained in the Wá&#39;ee as meaning,<br>\
And he who disbelieved remained in confusion, or<br>\
perplexity, not seeing his right course, looking as<br>\
one in wonder: (Lb, TA:) but accord. to him<br>\
who reads فَبَهَتَ, the word الذى may hold the<br>\
place of a noun in the accus. case [as will<br>\
be seen from what follows]. (IJ, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  بَهَتَهُ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
بَهَتَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. بَهْتٌ, (S, K,) He, or it,<br>\
caused him to become confounded, perplexed, or<br>\
amazed, not seeing his right course: (Zj, Msb:<br>\
[Golius, on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof, assigns<br>\
this meaning to ↓ بهّتهُ:]) or took him unawares,<br>\
or by surprise, or unexpectedly, or suddenly. (S,<br>\
K.) Zj cites as an ex. of the former meaning the<br>\
saying in the Kur [xxi. 41], تَأْتِيهِمْ بَغْتَةً فَتَبْهَتُهُمْ,<br>\
i. e., It shall come upon them suddenly, or unawares, and cause them to become confounded,<br>\
&amp;c.: (TA: and so Bd and Jel explain it:) or,<br>\
and shall overcome them: (Bd:) J cites the same<br>\
as an ex. of the latter of the two meanings in the<br>\
preceding sentence; but his doing so requires<br>\
consideration; for the meaning which he gives<br>\
is taken from the word بغتة; not from البَهْتُ.<br>\
(MF, TA.) [But it is said also that] مُبَاهَتَةٌ [inf. n.<br>\
of ↓ باهتهُ] signifies The taking, or coming upon,<br>\
[one] unawares, by surprise, or unexpectedly.<br>\
(JK.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بَهَتَهُ, aor.<br>\
بَهَتَ, (S, A, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. بَهْتٌ<br>\
and بَهَتٌ and بُهْتَانٌ, (S, K,) or the last is a simple<br>\
subst., (Msb,) He calumniated him; slandered<br>\
him; accused him falsely; said against him that<br>\
which he had not done: (S, A, K:) [or he did<br>\
so in such a manner as to make one to be confounded, or perplexed, or amazed, at the falsity<br>\
of the charge, and not to see his right course:<br>\
(see بُهْتَانٌ, below:)] he lied against him; forged<br>\
a lie, or lies, against him; and i. q. قَابَلَهُ بِالكَذِبِ<br>\
[he accused him to his face falsely, or with falsehood]; (TA;) البَهْتُ signifies اِسْتِقْبَالُكَ أَخَاكَ بِمَا<br>\
لَيْسَ فِيهِ [thy accusing thy brother, or fellow, to<br>\
his face, of that which is not in him]: (JK:)<br>\
and بَهَتَهَا, aor.<br>\
بَهَتَ, inf. n. بَهْتٌ, he accused her<br>\
falsely of adultery; and forged a lie against her.<br>\
(Msb.) [See also اِغْتَابَهُ.] In the saying of Abu-n-Nejm,<br>\
سُبِّى الحَمَاةَ وَابْهَتِى عَلَيْهَا<br>\
[Revile thou the mother-in-law, and calumniate<br>\
her, or forge lies against her], على is [said by<br>\
J to be] redundant, or pleonastic; for one does<br>\
not say, بَعَتَ عَلَيْهِ, but only بَهَتَهُ. (S.) Upon<br>\
this, F says, in the K, that فَابْهَتِى عليها [thus in<br>\
the K] is a mistake; that J is in error, and that<br>\
the right reading is فَانْهَتِى عليها, with ن: but<br>\
this assertion made by F depends upon the authority of relaters of the verse in which the word in<br>\
question occurs. (MF.) IB says that ابهتى may<br>\
be here rendered trans. by means of على because<br>\
it is syn. with اِفْتَرِى, which is so rendered trans.,<br>\
in like manner as is done in other instances, of<br>\
which he gives an ex. from the Kur [xxiv. 63],<br>\
يُخَالِفُونَ عَنْ أَمْرِهِ, meaning يَخْرُجُونَ عن امره: he<br>\
adds that, accord. to J, عن in this ex. should<br>\
be considered redundant; but that عن and على<br>\
are not used redundantly like ب. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
بَهَتَ الفَحْلَ عَنِ النَّاقَةِ He removed the stallion<br>\
from the she-camel in order that a stallion of<br>\
more generous race might cover her. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
بَهَّتَ see 1.<br>\
3<br>\
باهتهُ, inf. n. مُبَاهَتَةٌ: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also He<br>\
engaged with him in mutual calumny, slander, or<br>\
false accusation: a meaning indicated, but not<br>\
expressed, in the A.] You say, بَيْنَهُمَا مُبَاهَتَةٌ<br>\
[Between them two is mutual calumniation, &amp;c.]:<br>\
and عَادَتُهُ أَنْ يُبَاحِثَ وَيُبَاهِتَ [His custom is to<br>\
engage with another in mutual scrutiny of secrets,<br>\
or faults, or the like, and in mutual calumniation,<br>\
&amp;c.]: and وَلَا تَمَاقَتُوا ↓ لَا تَبَاهَتُوا [Calumniate ye<br>\
not one another, &amp;c., nor hate ye one another on<br>\
account of any foul, or evil, affair]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And He confounded, perplexed, or amazed, him<br>\
(namely, his hearer,) by what he forged against<br>\
him. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَبَاْهَتَ see 3.<br>\
بَهْتٌ: see بُهْتَانٌ.<br>\
-A2-  A certain well-known kind<br>\
of stone. (K.)<br>\
بُهْتٌ: see بُهْتَانٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  A certain<br>\
sidereal computation, or calculation; being [that<br>\
of] the direct course of stars in a day: [in Persian, a planet&#39;s motion in any given time: (Johnson&#39;s Pers. Arab. and Engl. Dict.:)] thought by<br>\
Az to be not Arabic. (TA.)<br>\
بُهْتَانٌ and ↓ بَهِيتَةٌ signify the same [when the<br>\
former is used as a subst.; i. e. A calumny, slander, or false accusation]: (S, A, Msb: [see 1:])<br>\
or both signify, the former as explained by Aboo-Is-hák, and the latter as explained in the K, a<br>\
falsehood by reason of which one is confounded,<br>\
or perplexed, and unable to see his right course;<br>\
(TA; [in which it seems to be indicated that<br>\
↓ بُهْتٌ signifies the same;]) from البَهْتُ as meaning<br>\
“ the being confounded ” &amp;c.: (Aboo-Is-hák, TA:)<br>\
the former is a subst. signifying [also] a false<br>\
accusation of adultery against a woman; and a<br>\
forgery of a lie against her: (Msb:) and ↓ the<br>\
latter, [and the former also, simply,] a lying, or<br>\
lie, or falsehood; (K;) and so ↓ بُهْتٌ (K) and<br>\
↓ بَهْتٌ. (TA.) بُهْتَانًا وَإِثْمًا مُبِينًا, in the Kur iv. 24,<br>\
is said to mean Falsely accusing of adultery, and<br>\
acting in a manifestly sinful or criminal manner:<br>\
(Bd:) or it means acting wrongfully &amp;c. (Bd,<br>\
Jel.) You say, ↓ رَمَاهُ بِالبَهِيتَةِ [He accused him with,<br>\
or of, calumny, &amp;c.]. (A.) And ↓ يَا ِللْبَهِيتَةِ, with<br>\
kesr to the [prep.] ل, [i. e., O, come to my aid, or<br>\
succour, on account of the calumny! &amp;c.; for it<br>\
is] a phrase used in calling for aid, or succour.<br>\
(S.) [And if you would express wonder, you say,<br>\
↓ يَا َللْبَهِيتَةِ, with fet-h to the prep. ل, i. e. O the<br>\
calumny! &amp;c.]<br>\
بَهُوتٌ [A great, or frequent, calumniator, slanderer, or false-accuser; as also ↓ بَهَّاتٌ, mentioned<br>\
in the S only as an epithet applied to him who<br>\
calumniates, slanders, or accusely falsely;] an<br>\
intensive epithet from البَهْتُ; (IAth;) [i. e.] an<br>\
intensive form of the act. part. n. from البُهْتَان<br>\
[inf. n. of بَهَتَهُ]: (Mgh:) or i. q. ↓ مُبَاهِتٌ; (K;)<br>\
i. e., one who confounds, or perplexes, or amazes,<br>\
the hearer, by what he forges against him: (TA:)<br>\
and one who falsely accuses a woman of adultery,<br>\
and forges a lie against her: (Msb:) pl. بُهُتٌ<br>\
(IAth, Mgh, Msb, K) and بُهْتٌ, and, accord. to<br>\
the K, also بُهُوتٌ; but ISd and MF hold it to be<br>\
pl. of بَاهِتٌ, not of بَهُوتٌ; the former observing,<br>\
that a word of the measure فَاعِلٌ is one of those<br>\
which have a pl. of the measure فُعُولٌ, but not so<br>\
one of the measure فَعُولٌ; and that, as to the<br>\
saying of A&#39;Obeyd, that عُذُوبٌ is pl. of عَذُوبٌ, it<br>\
is a mistake; for it is only pl. of عَاذِبٌ, and<br>\
the pl. of عَذُوبٌ is عُذُبٌ. (TA. [But see art.<br>\
عذب.])<br>\
بَهِيتٌ, see مَبْهُوتٌ, in two places.<br>\
بَهِيتَةٌ: see بُهْتَانٌ, in five places.<br>\
بَهَّاتٌ: see بَهُوتٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and see مَبْهُوتٌ.<br>\
بَاهِتٌ: see مَبْهُوتٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also act.<br>\
part. n. [of بَهَتَهُ; signifying Causing to become<br>\
confounded, &amp;c.: and calumniating, &amp;c.:] from<br>\
البُهْتَانُ: (Mgh:) بُهُوتٌ, as mentioned above, is<br>\
held by ISd and MF to be a pl. of this word;<br>\
not of بَهُوتٌ, q. v. (TA.)<br>\
مَبْهُوتٌ Confounded, perplexed, or amazed, and<br>\
unable to see his right course: (S, K:) [other<br>\
(similar) meanings may be seen from explanations<br>\
of بُهِتَ:] accord. to Ks and the S and Sgh and<br>\
the K, one should not say ↓ بَاهِتٌ nor ↓ بَهِيتٌ; but<br>\
there is no reason in analogy why he who says<br>\
بَهَتَ, like نَصَرَ and مَنَعَ, should not say thus:<br>\
(TA:) Lb says, in the Expos. of the Fs, that<br>\
they said ↓ بَاهِتٌ and ↓ بَهَّاتٌ [which latter is an<br>\
intensive form] and ↓ بَهِيتٌ, which [last] may be<br>\
considered as having the meaning of the measure<br>\
مَفْعُولٌ, like مَبْهُوتٌ, or that of the measure فَاعِلٌ,<br>\
like بَاهِتٌ; but the former is the more agreeable<br>\
with analogy, and the more probable. (MF, TA)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also Calumniated, slandered, or falsely accused.<br>\
(S.)<br>\
مُبَاهِتٌ: see بَهُوتٌ.<br>\
