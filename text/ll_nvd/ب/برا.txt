بَرِئَ, [aor.<br>\
بَرَاَ, inf. n. generally بُرْءٌ or بَرَآءَةٌ,]<br>\
He was, or became, clear, or free, of, or from,<br>\
a thing; in the manners which will be explained<br>\
below: (Bd ii. 51:) he was, or became, in a<br>\
state of freedom or immunity, secure, or safe.<br>\
(T.) [Hence,] بَرِئَ مِنَ المَرَضِ, and بَرَأَ, (T, Msb,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
بَرَاَ; and بَرُؤَ, aor.<br>\
بَرُاَ; (Msb;) inf. n. بُرْءٌ: (T,<br>\
Msb:) or بَرِئَ من المرض, inf. n. بُرْءٌ, with<br>\
damm; and the people of El-Hijáz say بَرَأَ, inf. n.<br>\
بَرْءٌ, with fet-h: (S:) accord. to As, بَرِىَ من<br>\
المرض is of the dial. of Temeem; and بَرَأَ of the<br>\
dial. of the people of El-Hijáz: or, accord. to<br>\
AZ, the people of El-Hijáz say بَرَأَ; and the rest<br>\
of the Arabs say بَرِئَ: (T:) or بَرَأَ [alone], said<br>\
of a sick man, aor.<br>\
بَرُاَ and<br>\
بَرَاَ; and بَرِئَ; and بَرُؤَ;<br>\
inf. n. بَرْءٌ [probably a mistranscription for بُرْءٌ]<br>\
and بُرُؤٌ: or, accord. to Lh, the people of El-<br>\
Hijáz say بَرَأَ, aor.<br>\
بَرُاَ, inf. n. بُرْءٌ and بُرُؤٌ [i. e.<br>\
بُرُوْءٌ]; and the people of El-&#39;Áliyeh, [بَرَأَ,] aor.<br>\
بَرَاَ,<br>\
inf. n. بُرْءٌ and بُرُؤُ; and Temeem, بَرِئَ, [aor.<br>\
بَرَاَ,]<br>\
inf. n. بُرْءٌ and بُرُؤٌ: (M:) or بَرَأَ, (K,) said by<br>\
IKtt to be the most chaste form, (TA,) aor.<br>\
بَرَاَ,<br>\
(K,) agreeably with analogy, (TA,) and<br>\
بَرُاَ, (K,)<br>\
said by Zj to be the only instance of a verb of<br>\
the measure فَعَلَ with ء for its last radical letter<br>\
having its aor. of the measure يَفْعُلُ, [though<br>\
others mention also قَرَأَ, aor. يَقْرُؤُ, and هَنَأَ, aor.<br>\
يَهْنُؤُ,] and asserted to be a bad form, (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. بُرْءٌ and بُرُوْءٌ; and بَرُؤَ, (K,) not a chaste<br>\
form, (TA,) aor.<br>\
بَرُاَ; and بَرِئَ, (K,) a chaste<br>\
form, (TA,) [and the most common of all,]<br>\
aor.<br>\
بَرَاَ, inf. n. بَرْءٌ and بُرُؤٌ, (K, TA,) or بُرْءٌ, (CK,)<br>\
and بُرُوْءٌ; (K, TA;) He became free from the<br>\
disease, sickness, or malady: (T:) or [he recovered<br>\
from it:] he became convalescent; or sound, or<br>\
healthy, at the close of disease, but was yet weak;<br>\
or he recovered, but not completely, his health<br>\
and strength; syn. نِقَهَ; (M, K;) i. e., he acquired that slight degree of soundness, or health,<br>\
which comes at the close of disease, but with<br>\
disease remaining in him. (TA.) [And بَرِئَ<br>\
الجُرْجُ, or بَرَأَ, The wound healed; or became in<br>\
a healing state: of frequent occurrence.] And<br>\
بَرِئَ مِنَ الأَمْرِ, [the only form of the verb used in<br>\
this case, and in the other cases in which it is mentioned below,] aor.<br>\
بَرَاَ and<br>\
بَرُاَ, the latter extr., (M,<br>\
K,) or rather it is very strange, for IKoot says<br>\
that نَعِمَ, aor. يَنْعُمُ, and فَضِلَ, aor. يَفْضُلُ, are<br>\
the only instances of this kind, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\
بَرَآءَةٌ (M, K) and بَرَآءٌ (Lh, M, K) and بُرُؤٌ, (M,)<br>\
or بُرْءٌ, (K, TA,) or بُرُوْءٌ; (CK;) and ↓ تبرّأ; (S, *<br>\
M, K, Mgh; *) [He was, or became, free from<br>\
the thing, or affair; or clear, or quit, thereof;<br>\
clear of having or taking, or of having had or<br>\
taken, any part therein; guiltless of it: and<br>\
also, irresponsible for it; as in an ex. q. v. voce<br>\
عِضَاضٌ:] said in relation to [a fault or the like,<br>\
and] a debt, and a claim, and religion [&amp;c.].<br>\
(Lh, M.) You say, بَرِئَ مِنَ العَيْبِ, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
or العُيُوبِ, (S,) inf. n. بَرَآءَةٌ, (Mgh,) He was,<br>\
or became, free (Msb) [from the fault, defect,<br>\
imperfection, blemish, or vice], (Mgh, Msb,) [or<br>\
faults, &amp;c.]. (S.) And بَرِئَ مِنَ الدَّيْنِ, (T,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) or الدُّيُونِ, (S,) aor.<br>\
بَرَاَ, (T, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. بَرَآءَةٌ, (T, Mgh, Msb,) He was, or became,<br>\
clear, or quit, of the debt; (or debts; S;) irresponsible for it [or them]: or in a state of immunity with respect to it [or them]; i. e., exempt<br>\
from the demand thereof. (Msb.) And بَرئَ<br>\
إِلَيْكَ مِنْ حَقِّكَ, inf. n. بَرَآءَةٌ and بَرَآءٌ (Lh, M)<br>\
and بُرُؤٌ, [He was, or became, clear, or quit, to<br>\
thee, of thy claim, or due, or right; or exempt<br>\
from the demand thereof;] as also ↓ تبرّأ. (M.)<br>\
And بَرِئْتُ إِلَيْكَ مِنْ فُلَانٍ, inf. n. بَرَآءةٌ, [I was,<br>\
or became, or have become, clear, to thee, of having<br>\
or taking, or of having had or taken, any part with<br>\
such a one; or, irresponsible to thee for such a<br>\
one:] (AZ, T, S: * [in one copy of the S, I find<br>\
the phrase بَرِئْتُ مِنْكَ, commencing the art.; but<br>\
not in other copies:]) this is the only form of the<br>\
verb used in this case, and in relation to debt [and<br>\
the like]. (AZ, T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He removed himself, or<br>\
kept, far, or aloof, [from unclean things, or things<br>\
occasioning blame; followed by مِنْ, with which<br>\
it may be rendered he shunned, or avoided;]<br>\
syn. تَنَزَّهُ and تَبَاعَدَ. (T.) [You say, بَرِئَ مِنَ<br>\
الأَقْذَارِ He removed himself, or kept, far, or<br>\
aloof, from unclean things.] ―<br>\
-b3-  He manifested<br>\
an excuse, [or asserted himself to be clear or quit<br>\
or irresponsible, like ↓ تبرّأ,] and gave warning;<br>\
syn. أَعْذَرَ and أَنْذَرَ. (T.) Hence, in the Kur<br>\
[ix. 1], بَرَآءَةٌ مِنَ اللّٰهِ وَرَسُولِهِ A manifestation of<br>\
excuse, and a warning, from God and his apostle.<br>\
(T.)<br>\
-A2-  بَرَأَ اللّٰهُ الخَلْقَ, (Fr, T, S, M, K,) or الخَلِيَقَةَ,<br>\
(Msb,) aor.<br>\
بَرَاَ, (T, M, &amp;c.,) inf. n. بَرْءٌ (T, S, M,<br>\
K) and بُرُوْءٌ, (AZ, Lh, M, K,) God created<br>\
mankind, or the beings, or things, that are created,<br>\
syn. خَلَقَ, (Fr, T, M, Msb, K,) after no similitude, or model, (TA,) [but, properly, though not<br>\
always meaning so, out of pre-existing matter;<br>\
for] Bd says [in ii. 51] that the primary meaning<br>\
of the root برء is to denote a thing&#39;s becoming<br>\
clear, or free, of, or from, another thing; either<br>\
by being released [therefrom], as in بَرِئَ المَرِيضُ<br>\
مِنْ مَرَضِهِ and المَدْيُونُ مِنْ دَينِهِ [both sufficiently<br>\
explained above]; or by production [therefrom],<br>\
as in بَرَأَ اللّٰهُ آدَمَ مِنَ الطِّينِ [God produced, or<br>\
created, Adam, from, or out of, clay]. (TA.)<br>\
This verb relates to substances [as in the exs.<br>\
given above] and to accidents; and hence, [in<br>\
the Kur lvii. 22,] مِنْ قبْلِ أَنْ نَبْرَأَهَا [Before our<br>\
creating it, if ها refer to مُصِيبَة, preceding it;<br>\
but, as Bd says, it may refer to this, or to الأَرْض,<br>\
or to أَنْفُس]: (M:) but البَرْءُ has a more particular<br>\
application than الخَلْقُ; the former being particularly applied to the creation of animate beings,<br>\
with few exceptions: you say, بَرَأَ اللّٰهُ النَّسَمَةَ<br>\
وَ خَلَقَ السَّمٰوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ [God created, or produced,<br>\
man, or the soul, and He created the heavens<br>\
and the earth]. (TA.) [To this verb, or perhaps<br>\
to بَرَي, or to both,<br>\
בָּרָ is the Hebrew equivalent, properly (though not necessarily always) signifying “ he created out of pre-existing matter,”<br>\
or “ he fashioned. ”]<br>\
2<br>\
برّأهُ, inf. n. تَبْرئَةٌ: see 4, in four places.<br>\
[Hence,] لَا التَّبْرِئَةِ The لا that denies in a general<br>\
manner, absolutely, or to the uttermost; i. e. the<br>\
لا that is a universal negative. (Mughnee &amp;c.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also He verified his being free [from a thing],<br>\
clear, or quit, [of it,] guiltless [of it], or irresponsible [for it]. (Mgh, TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
بارأهُ, (T, S, M, Mgh, K,) inf. n. مُبَارَأَةٌ (T,<br>\
M, Mgh) and بِرَآءٌ, (M,) He made him (his copartner) free, clear, quit, or irresponsible, the<br>\
latter doing to him the same: (Mgh:) he compounded, or made a compromise, with him (his<br>\
hired man, T, M) for their mutual separation:<br>\
(M:) he separated himself from him (his copartner, S, O), the latter doing the same. (S, O,<br>\
K.) And بَارَأْتُ الرَّجُلَ I became free, clear, quit,<br>\
or irresponsible, to the man, he becoming so to<br>\
me. (M.) And بارأ المَرْأَةَ, (T, M, K,) or امْرَأَتَهُ,<br>\
(S,) inf. n. as above, (M,) He compounded, or<br>\
made a compromise, with the woman (or his wife,<br>\
S) for their mutual separation; (M, K;) i. e.<br>\
he divorced her for a compensation [which she<br>\
was to make him, such as her giving up a<br>\
portion of her dowry remaining due to her, in<br>\
order that they might be clear, each of the other]:<br>\
it occurs also [without ء] in art. برى. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
ابرأهُ He (God, S, M, K) [recovered him, or]<br>\
restored him to convalescence, (M, K,) مِنَ المَرَضِ<br>\
[from the disease, sickness, or malady]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
أَبْرَأَكَ مِنَ الأَمْرِ and ↓ بَرَّأَكَ (M, K *) He (i. e.<br>\
God, TA) made thee, pronounced thee, or held thee,<br>\
or hath made thee, &amp;c., or may He make thee, &amp;c.,<br>\
to be free from the thing or affair, or clear or<br>\
quit thereof, or guiltless thereof, or irresponsible<br>\
for it; (TA;) [or He acquitted thee, or hath<br>\
acquitted thee, or may He acquit thee, thereof;<br>\
or He showed thee, or hath showed thee, or may<br>\
He show thee, to be free from it, &amp;c.: see also 2,<br>\
above:] said in relation to [a fault or the like,<br>\
and] a debt, and a claim, and religion [&amp;c.].<br>\
(M.) You say, مِنَ العَيْبِ ↓ بَرَّأْتُهُ I made him,<br>\
pronounced him, or held him, to be free from<br>\
the fault, defect, imperfection, blemish, or vice.<br>\
(Msb.) It is said in the Kur [xxxiii. 69], ↓ فَبَرَّأْهُ<br>\
اللّٰهُ مِمَا قَالُوا (M) But God showed him to be<br>\
clear of that which they said. (Bd.) You say<br>\
also, أَبْرَأْتُهُ مِنَ الدَّيْنِ I made him, pronounced<br>\
him, or held him, to be clear, or quit, of the<br>\
debt; irresponsible for it; or in a state of immunity with respect to it; i. e., exempt from<br>\
the demand thereof: (Msb:) and أَبْرَأْتُهُ مِمَّا لِى<br>\
عَلَيْهِ; and ↓ بَرَّأْتُهُ, inf. n. تَبْرِئَةٌ; [I acquitted him<br>\
of that which he owed me:] (S:) and أَبْرَأْتُهُ<br>\
[alone] I made him, pronounced him, or held<br>\
him, to be clear, or quit, of a claim that I had<br>\
upon him, or a due or right that he owed me.<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  ابرأ [in the T (as on the authority of<br>\
Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee) أَبْرَى] He entered<br>\
upon [the night, or day, called] البَرَآء, q. v. (K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَبَرَّاَ see 1, in three places. تبرّأ مِنْهُ also signifies<br>\
He asserted himself to be free from it; or clear,<br>\
or quit, of it; namely, a fault, or the like.<br>\
(Mgh.) [And He declared himself to be clear of<br>\
him; to be not connected, or implicated, with him;<br>\
he renounced him: see Kur ii. 161 and 162, &amp;c:]<br>\
6<br>\
تَبَارَأْنَا We separated ourselves, each from<br>\
the other. (TA.) [See 3.]<br>\
10<br>\
استبرأ, (T,) or استبرأ مِنَ البَوْلِ, (Msb,) He<br>\
took extraordinary pains, or the utmost pains,<br>\
in cleansing the orifice of his penis from the<br>\
remains of urine, by shaking it and pulling it<br>\
and the like, until he knew that nothing remained<br>\
in it: (T:) or he purified, or cleansed, himself<br>\
from urine; syn. تَنَزَّهُ عَنْهُ: (Msb:) or استبرأ,<br>\
(M,) or استبرأ الذَّكَرَ, (K, TA,) signifies he took<br>\
extraordinary pains, or the utmost pains, in<br>\
cleansing the penis from urine; or he cleansed<br>\
it entirely from urine; (M, * K, * TA;) and so<br>\
استبرأ الفَرْجَ: and in like manner, استبرأتِ الفَرْجَ<br>\
said of a woman: (El-Munáwee, TA:) but the<br>\
lawyers make a distinction between اسْتِبْرَآءٌ and<br>\
اِسْتِنْقَآءٌ [which are made syn. in the M and K]:<br>\
see the latter word. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And استبرأ الجَارِيَةَ,<br>\
(T, S, Mgh,) or المَرْأَةَ, (M, Msb, K,) He abstained<br>\
from sexual intercourse (T, M, K) with the<br>\
girl whom he had purchased or whom he had<br>\
taken captive, (T,) or with the woman, (M, K,)<br>\
until she had menstruated (T, M, K) at his abode,<br>\
once, and then become purified: (T:) the meaning is, (T,) he sought to find her free from<br>\
pregnancy. (T, Mgh, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence, (Mgh,)<br>\
استبرأ الشَّيْءِ, (Z, Mgh, Msb,) or الأَمْرَ, (TA,) He<br>\
searched, searched out, or sought to find or discover,<br>\
the uttermost of the thing, or affair, (Z, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA,) in order that he might know it, (Mgh,)<br>\
to put an end to his doubt. (Z, Mgh, Msb, TA.)<br>\
You say, اِسْتَبْرَأْتُ مَا عِنْدَكَ [I searched, or sought<br>\
to find or discover, or I have searched, &amp;c., the<br>\
uttermost of what thou hast, of knowledge &amp;c.].<br>\
(S, TA.) And استبرأ أرْضَ كَذَا فَمَا وَجَدَ ضَالَّتَهُ<br>\
[He searched the uttermost of such a land and<br>\
found not his stray beast]. (TA.) It is said<br>\
in the Expos. of the Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer that<br>\
اِسْتِبْرَآءٌ is an expression denoting The seeking, or<br>\
seeking leisurely and repeatedly, to obtain knowledge of a thing, until one knows it; considering<br>\
it with the endeavour to obtain a clear knowledge<br>\
of it; taking, in doing so, the course prescribed<br>\
by prudence, precaution, or good judgment.<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
بُرُأَةٌ A hunter&#39;s lurking-place or covert: (T, S,<br>\
M, K:) pl. بُرَأٌ. (T, S, M.) El-Aashà says,<br>\
بِهَا بُرَأٌ مِثْلُ الفَسِيلِ المُكَمَّمِ<br>\
[At it (a source of water mentioned in the context)<br>\
were hunters&#39; lurking-places, like young palmtrees covered over: for tender young palm-trees<br>\
are often covered over with a kind of coarse<br>\
matting]. (T, S, M.)<br>\
بَرَآءٌ: see بَرِىْءٌ, in six places. ―<br>\
-b2-  البَرَآءٌ The first<br>\
night of the [lunar] month; (El-Mázinee, T, S,<br>\
K;) called thus, (S,) or لَيْلَةُ البَرَآءِ, (M,) because<br>\
the moon has then become clear of the sun: (S,<br>\
M:) or the first day of the month: (AA, T, K:)<br>\
or the last night thereof: (As, T, K:) or the last<br>\
day thereof; (IAar, T, K;) a fortunate day;<br>\
every event happening therein being regarded as<br>\
a means of obtaining a blessing; (IAar, T;) but<br>\
most hold that the last day of the month is termed<br>\
النَّحِيرَةٌ; (TA;) as also اِبْنُ البَرَآءِ: (K:) or this<br>\
is the first day of the month: (IAar, T, TA:) pl.<br>\
أَبْرِئَةٌ. (Th, M.)<br>\
بُرَآءُ: see بَرِىْءٌ, in two places.<br>\
بَرِىْءٌ Free, (Msb,) مِنْهُ from it; namely a<br>\
fault, defect, imperfection, blemish, or vice;<br>\
(Mgh, Msb;) and, also followed by مِنْهُ, clear,<br>\
or quit, of it; irresponsible for it; or in a state<br>\
of immunity with respect to it; i. e. exempt from<br>\
the demand thereof; namely a debt, (Msb,) or a<br>\
claim, or due, or right; (Mgh;) as also ↓ بَارِىٌ<br>\
and ↓ بَرَآءٌ. (Msb.) You say, أَنَا بَرِىْءٌ مِنْهُ [I am<br>\
free from it, &amp;c.]; (T, * S, M, K; *) and ↓ بَرَآءٌ,<br>\
used alike as sing. and dual and pl. (Fr, T, S, M,<br>\
K) and masc. and fem., (Fr, T, M, K,) because<br>\
it is originally an inf. n.; (Fr, T, S;) and ↓ بُرَآءٌ:<br>\
(S, M:) the pl. of بَرِىْءٌ is بَرِيؤُونَ (T, S, K) and<br>\
بُرَأءُ (T, S, M, K) and بُرَآءٌ, (T, M, K,) of the measure فُعَالٌ, (T,) like رُخَالٌ, (M, K,) of an extr.<br>\
measure, disapproved by Suh, who says, in the<br>\
R, that it is a contraction of بُرَأءُ, and has tenween<br>\
because it resembles [words originally of the measure] فُعَالٌ, and that the rel. n. formed from it is<br>\
↓ بُرَاوِىٌّ, (TA,) but it is mentioned by AAF as a<br>\
pl. of بَرِىْءٌ, and as being like رُخَالٌ, and Fr mentions بُرَآءُ as a pl. of the same, imperfectly decl.,<br>\
with one of the two hemzehs suppressed, (M,)<br>\
and بِرَآءٌ (S, M, K) and أَبْرَآءٌ (S, K) and أَبْرِئَآءُ, (T,<br>\
S, K,) the last two anomalous: (TA:) the fem.<br>\
of بَرِيْءٌ is بَرِيْئَةٌ; pl. بَرِيْآتٌ (T, S, M, K) and<br>\
بَرِيَّاتٌ (Lh, M, K) and بَرَايَا. (T, S, M, K.) You<br>\
say, أَنَا بَرِىْءٌ مِنْهُ and خَلِىٌّ مِنْهُ [I am free from<br>\
it; or, more commonly, I am clear, or quit, of<br>\
it, or him]; and مِنْهُ ↓ أنَا بَرَآءٌ and خَلَآءٌ مِنْهُ; (S;)<br>\
and مِنْهُ ↓ أَنَا البَرَآءُ: (M:) and ↓ نَحْنُ مِنْكَ البَرَآءُ<br>\
and الخَلَآءُ [We are clear, or quit, of you]; (Fr,<br>\
T;) i. e., ذَوُو البَرَآءِ: so says Aboo-Is-hák; and<br>\
As says the like of what Fr says. (T.) It is said<br>\
in the Kur [xliii. 25], مِمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ ↓ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ<br>\
[Verily I am clear of that which ye worship];<br>\
(T, M;) or بَرِىْءٌ, or ↓ بُرَآءٌ; accord. to different<br>\
readers. (Bd.) بَرِىْءٌ occurs in several places in<br>\
the Kur. (M.) Accord. to IAar, it signifies<br>\
Clear of evil qualities or dispositions; shunning<br>\
what is vain and false; remote from actions that<br>\
occasion suspicion; pure in heart from associating<br>\
any with God: and it signifies sound in body and<br>\
intellect. (T.) See also بَارِئٌ, in two places.<br>\
بَرَآءَةٌ A writing of [i. e. conferring] immunity<br>\
or exemption: from بَرِئَ مِنَ الدَّيْنِ and العَيْب, of<br>\
which it is the inf. n.: pl. بَرَاآتٌ, with medd:<br>\
بَرَاوَاتٌ is [pl. of بَرَاةٌ, and both of these are] vulgar.<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
بُرَاوِىٌّ: see بَرِىْءٌ.<br>\
البَرِيَّةُ The creation; as meaning the beings, or<br>\
things, that are created; or, particularly, mankind; syn. الخَلْقُ: (T, S, M:) pronounced without ء; (T, S;) originally with ء, like نَبِىٌّ and<br>\
ذُرِّيَةٌ; (M;) and the people of Mekkeh differ<br>\
from the other Arabs in pronouncing these three<br>\
words with ء: (Yoo, T, M:) Lh says that the<br>\
Arabs agree in omitting the ء in these three instances; and he does not except the people of<br>\
Mekkeh: (M:) it is of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ in the<br>\
sense of مَفْعُولَةٌ, (Msb,) from بَرَأَ اللّٰهُ الخَلْقَ, meaning خَلَقَهُمْ: (Fr, T:) or, if derived from البَرَى<br>\
[“earth” or “dust”], it is originally without ء:<br>\
(Fr, T, S:) pl. بَرَايَا and بَرِيَّاتٌ. (S in art. برو<br>\
and برى.)<br>\
بَارِئٌ, (K,) or بَارِئٌ مِنْ مَرَضِهِ, (Lh, S, M,)<br>\
[Recovering from his disease, sickness, or malady:<br>\
or] convalescent; or becoming sound, or healthy,<br>\
at the close of his disease, but being yet weak; or<br>\
recovering, but not completely, his health and<br>\
strength: [see 1:] (M, K:) as also ↓ بَرِئْءٌ: (Lh,<br>\
M, K:) but whether the latter be properly used<br>\
in this sense is disputed; while the former is said<br>\
to be the act. part. n. of 1 in all its senses: (TA:)<br>\
pl. بِرَآءٌ, (M, K,) like as صِحَاحٌ is pl. of صَحِيحٌ,<br>\
accord. to Lh, so that he holds it to be pl. of<br>\
بَرِىْءٌ; or it may be pl. of بَارِئٌ, like as جِيَاعٌ is<br>\
pl. of جَائِعٌ, and صِحَابٌ of صَاحِبٌ. (M.) ↓ بَرِىْءٌ<br>\
is sometimes written and pronounced بَرِىٌّ [in all<br>\
its senses]. (Kz.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also بَرِيْءٌ.<br>\
-A2-  البَارِئُ,<br>\
applied to God, The Creator; (T, S, Msb;) He<br>\
who hath created the things that are created, not<br>\
after any similitude, or model; (Nh;) or He who<br>\
hath created those things free from any incongruity, or faultiness, (Mgh, and Bd in ii. 51,)<br>\
