man) was, or became, such as is termed بَجَال and<br>\

condition; having abundance of herbage, or of<br>\
the goods or conveniences or comforts of life. (K.)<br>\

happy. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  [بَجَلَهُ He bled him (namely, a<br>\
horse, or a camel,) by opening the vein called<br>\
الأَبْجَل: so accord. to analogy; like وَدَجَهُ,<br>\
meaning “he bled him by opening the vein called<br>\
الوَدَج,” &amp;c.] لَمْ يُبْجَلْ means He had not been<br>\
bled in the أَبْجَل. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
بجّلهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. تَبْجِيلٌ, He magnified, honoured, revered, venerated, or respected,<br>\
him: (S, Msb, K:) or he said to him بَجَلٌ,<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  It rejoiced him. (TA.)<br>\
بُجْلٌ: see بَجَلٌ.<br>\
بَجَلْ is a noun (Mughnee) syn. with حَسْبُ:<br>\
(S, Mughnee, K: *) and is also a verbal noun syn.<br>\
with يَكْفِى. (Mughnee, K. *) You say بَجَلِى (S,<br>\
Mughnee, K) and بَجْلِى, (S, K,) meaning حَسْبِى<br>\
[My sufficiency, or a thing sufficing me, i. e.<br>\
sufficient for me, is such a thing]: (S, Mughnee,<br>\
K:) [it is said in the Ham, p. 145, as on the<br>\
authority of Akh, that they do not say بَجْلى;<br>\
but this is a mistranscription for بَجَلْنِى, as will<br>\
be seen from what follows:] and, using it as a<br>\
verbal noun, (Mughnee, K,) but this is rare,<br>\
(Mughnee,) you say بَجَلْنِى, meaning يَكْفِينِى [It<br>\
suffices me, or will suffice me]; (Mughnee, K;)<br>\
and بَجَلْكَ, meaning يَكْفِيكَ [It suffices thee, or<br>\
will suffice thee]: (K:) or, accord. to Akh, they<br>\
say بَجَلْكَ, like as they say, قَطْكَ; but not بَجَلْنِى,<br>\
like قَطْنِى: (S:) or the ن in بَجَلْنِى is absolutely<br>\
necessary accord. to him who says that بَجَلٌ is a<br>\
verbal noun; and accord. to him who says that<br>\
this word is syn. with حَسْبُ, the ن is allowable.<br>\
(MF.) [See, under the words قَدْ and قَطْ, what<br>\
is said respecting قَدْنِى and قَطْنِى.] In the saying<br>\
of Jábir Ibn-Ra-lán Es-Simbisee,<br>\
لَمَّا رَأَتْ مَعْشَرًا قَلَّتْ حَمُولَتُهُمْ<br>\
قَالَتْ سُعَادُ أَهٰذَا مَالُكُمْ بَجَلَا<br>\
[When she saw a company whose beasts of burden<br>\
were few, So&#39;ád said, Is this your property,<br>\
sufficing you?] meaning, when she saw the fewness of our camels: the last word occupies the<br>\
place of a denotative of state, and is made to end<br>\
thus by poetic license: Abu-l-&#39;Alà says that this<br>\
word may be put in the accus. case as meaning<br>\
not exceeding what I see; or it may be for بَجَلِى,<br>\
after the manner of some of the Arabs who are<br>\
related, by Akh and others, to have said غُلَامَا for<br>\
غُلَامِى. (Ham pp. 299 and 300.) [See also 2:<br>\
and see بَجَلٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  It is also a particle, (Mughnee,)<br>\
meaning نَعَمْ [Yes; yea; or even so]. (Mughnee, K.)<br>\
بَجَلٌ Calumny, slander, or false accusation:<br>\
or this is with damm; (K;) i. e. ↓ بُجْلٌ; (T,<br>\
TA;) meaning a great calumny &amp;c.; (K, * TA;)<br>\
and Az thinks that this may be a dial. var. of<br>\
بُجْرٌ, with which it is syn.; because ل and ر are<br>\
interchanged in many instances. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A<br>\
wonderful thing; syn. عَجَبٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ذُو البَحَلِ<br>\
denotes dispraise; meaning Content with mean<br>\
things; not desirous of the means of acquiring<br>\
eminence: (K:) or content that another should<br>\
manage affairs in his stead, and that he should be<br>\
a burden upon others, saying, Sufficient for me<br>\
(حَسْبِى [or بَجَلِى]) is that [state or condition]<br>\
wherein I am: (O, TA:) from a saying of Luk-<br>\
mán Ibn-&#39;Ád; (O, K;) as is also ذُو البَجْلَةِ,<br>\
which denotes praise. (O, TA.)<br>\
بَجْلَةٌ A goodly, or beautiful, from or appearance, figure, person, mien, or external state or<br>\
condition: (Sh, K:) a pleasing aspect; goodliness,<br>\
or beauty; grounds of pretension to respect; and<br>\
excellence; or sharpness, or quickness, of intellect.<br>\
(TA.) You say, إِنَّهُ لَذُو بَجْلَةٍ [Verily he has a<br>\
goodly, or beautiful, form &amp;c.]. (Sh, TA.) [See<br>\
the end of the next preceding paragraph.] ―<br>\

[Magnified, honoured, revered, venerated, or respected]: (Sh, K:) or bulky, or corpulent; (As,<br>\
S;) applied to a man; (As, TA;) or to an old<br>\
man: (S:) or the former signifies an old, or aged,<br>\
lord or chief: (AA, S:) or a bulky, or corpulent,<br>\
old man: or, as some say, one beyond the middle<br>\
age, in whom one sees goodliness of form or<br>\

or both signify an old man, who is a great lord<br>\
or chief, endowed with goodliness, and with excel-lence, or sharpness of intellect: (K:) not applied<br>\
