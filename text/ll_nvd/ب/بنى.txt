بَنَاهُ, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
بَنِىَ, (M, Msb,) and<br>\
بَنُىَ,<br>\
but the former is the more common, (M,) [or<br>\
rather the only form commonly known,] inf. n.<br>\
بِنَآءٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, K) and بِنًا (T, and TA as<br>\
from the M [but it is not in the transcript of the<br>\
M in the TT]) and بَنْىٌ and بُنْيَانٌ and بِنْيَةٌ and<br>\
بنَايَةٌ, (M, K,) He built it; framed it; constructed<br>\
it; contr. of هَدَمَهُ; (M, K;) namely, a house,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb,) or tent, (S, * Msb,) &amp;c.; (Msb;)<br>\
as also ↓ ابتناه, (S, M, Msb, K,) and ↓ بنّاهُ; (M,<br>\
K;) or the last has teshdeed given to it to denote<br>\
muchness, or frequency, or repetition, of the<br>\
action, or its application to many objects; and<br>\
hence you say, بنّى قُصُورًا [He built palaces, or<br>\
pavilions: or he raised them high: see the pass.<br>\
part. n. below]. (S, TA.) AHn speaks of a kind<br>\
of plank as being used فِى بِنَآءِ السُّفُنِ [in the construction of ships]: but بِنَآءٌ is originally used<br>\
only in relation to that which does not grow; as<br>\
stone, and clay, and the like. (M.) You say<br>\
also, بَنَى أَرْضًا, for بَنَى فِى أَرْضٍ [He built in, or<br>\
upon, land]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] بَنَى عَلَى أَهْلِهِ,<br>\
(T, S, M, Msb, K,) or عَلَى امْرَأَتِهِ, (Mgh,) and<br>\
بَنَى بِهَا also, (M, Mgh, Msb, K,) accord. to IDrd<br>\
(Mgh, Msb) and IJ, (M,) and occurring in traditions and elsewhere, though said in the S to be<br>\
vulgar, (IAth, MF,) and said to be so by ISk,<br>\
(T, Msb,) and by some said to be not allowable,<br>\
(M,) but the former is the more chaste, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. بِنَآءٌ; (S, TA;) as also ↓ ابتنى, (K,) i. e.<br>\
ابتنى عليها, (ISk, Msb,) or ابتنى بِهَا, (IJ, M,)<br>\
He had his wife conducted to him on the occasion<br>\
of the marriage: (ISk, T, S, Msb, K:) or he<br>\
went in to his wife [for the first time]: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) originating from the fact that the bridegroom used, on that occasion, to pitch a tent for<br>\
her, (ISk, T, S, Mgh, Msb,) a new tent, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) and furnish it with what was requisite,<br>\
(Msb,) or a new tent was set up for him, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) in honour of him. (Msb.) [See also بَيْتٌ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  بِنَايَةٌ is sometimes used in relation to nobility:<br>\
(M, K:) and the verb thus used is بَنَى, as above,<br>\
(T, M,) having [also] بِنًى for its inf. n., (IAar,<br>\
T,) and بِنَآءٌ; held by many to be tropical, but by<br>\
some to be proper. (MF.) Lebeed says,<br>\
فَسَمَا إِلَيْهِ كَهْلُهَا وَ غُلَامُهَا  فَبَنَى لَنَا رَفِيعًا سَمْكُهُ<br>\
(M) And He (namely, God,) hath built for us a<br>\
house of nobility of lofty pitch, and its (the<br>\
tribe&#39;s) middle-aged and its youth have risen to<br>\
it: i. e., all of them have attained to high degrees.<br>\
(EM, p. 180.) ―<br>\
-b4-  بَنَى بَدَنَهُ It (food) fattened<br>\
his body, (K,) and made it large: (TA:) and<br>\
بَنَى لَحْمَهُ, (T, M, K,) aor.<br>\
بَنِىَ, (TA,) inf. n. بِنَآءٌ,<br>\
(M,) or بَنْىٌ, (TA,) It (food) made his flesh to<br>\
grow, (T, M, K,) and to become large. (T, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  بَنَى الرَّجُلَ He reared, brought up, or educated,<br>\
the man; (M, K;) as also ↓ ابتناهُ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [بَنَى<br>\
كَلِمَةً, inf. n. بِنَآءٌ, He formed a word. ―<br>\
-b7-  And<br>\
He made a word indeclinable, so as to end invariably with a quiescent letter or with a particular<br>\
vowel.] بِنَآءُ كَلِمَةٍ [when the former word is considered as the inf. n. of the pass. form بُنِىَ, generally] signifies A word&#39;s keeping always the same<br>\
mode of termination, ending with a quiescent<br>\
letter or with a particular vowel, not by reason<br>\
of any governing word: (M, K:) as though the<br>\
word resembled a fixed, immoveable building.<br>\
(M.) [You say, بُنِيَتْ عَلَى السُّكُونِ It was made<br>\
indeclinable, with a quiescent letter for its termination; and عَلَى الفَتْحِ with fet-h for its termination; &amp;c. ―<br>\
-b8-  And in like manner you say, بَنَى<br>\
القَصِيدَةَ عَلَى البَآءِ, &amp;c., He made the قصيدة to<br>\
have ب, &amp;c., for its rhyme-letter, or its chief<br>\
rhyme-letter.]<br>\
-A2-  بَنَتِ القَوْسُ عَلَى وَتَرِهَا The bow<br>\
clave to its string (T, S, K) so that it (the latter)<br>\
almost broke. (T, S.) [See the part. n. below.]<br>\
2<br>\
بَنَّىَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
4<br>\
ابناهُ He made him to build, frame, or construct, a house, or tent: (S:) or he gave him a<br>\
building: or he gave him that wherewith to build<br>\
a house: (M, K:) and ابناهُ بَيْتًا he gave him a<br>\
house, or tent, to build or frame or construct.<br>\
(T.) It is said in a prov., المِعْزَي تُبْهِى وَلَا تُبْنِى<br>\
[Goats rend, or make holes, and render vacant,<br>\
and do not afford materials for fabricating tents];<br>\
i. e., they do not yield hair of which a tent is<br>\
fabricated; (T, S; *) for the tents of the Arabs<br>\
[of the desert] are of the kind called طِرَاف, made<br>\
of skin, and أَخْبِيَة, made of wool or of camels&#39; fur,<br>\
and not of شَعَر [by which is especially meant goats&#39;<br>\
hair], (S,) or, as is found in the handwriting of<br>\
Aboo-Sahl, of wool or of skin: (TA:) or the<br>\
meaning is, goats rend tents, or pierce them with<br>\
holes, by their leaping upon them, (T and S in<br>\
art. بهو,) so that they cannot be inhabited, (S in<br>\
that art.,) and do not aid in the fabrication of<br>\
tents; for the goats of the Arabs of the desert<br>\
have short hair, not long enough to be spun;<br>\
whereas the goats of the cold countries, and of the<br>\
people of the fertile regions, have abundant hair,<br>\
and of this the Akrád [or Kurdees] fabricate their<br>\
tents. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] He introduced him to<br>\
his wife [on the occasion of his marriage]: whence<br>\
the saying of &#39;Alee, مَتَى تُبْنيِنِى, accord. to IAth<br>\
properly meaning مَتَى تَجْعَلُنِى أَبْنِى بِزَوْجَتِى<br>\
[When wilt thou make me to have my wife conducted to me? or, to go in to my wife?]. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَبَنَّتْ, said of a woman sitting, (T, TA,) She<br>\
became like a tent (T, IAth, K, * TA) of the kind<br>\
called مِبْنَاةٌ, (T, TA,) i. e., a قُبَّة of skin; by reason<br>\
of her fatness, (T, IAth, TA,) and largeness, (T,<br>\
TA,) or fleshiness: (IAth, TA:) or she parted<br>\
her legs; as though from مِبْنَاة, i. e. a قُبَّة of skin,<br>\
which, when pitched, is spread out by the ropes:<br>\
so this woman, sitting cross-legged, spread apart<br>\
her legs. (T, TA.) And تبنّى, said of a camel&#39;s<br>\
hump, It became fat. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  تبنّاهُ He adopted<br>\
him as a son: (S, K:) or he asserted him to be,<br>\
or claimed him as, a son: (M:) and تبنّى بِهِ<br>\
signifies the same. (Zj, TA.)<br>\

ابتنى: see 1, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  Also It<br>\

بَنَاةُ اللَّحْمِ, (IB, TA,) the former of which words<br>\
is incorrectly written in the K بنات, (TA,) A girl<br>\
whose flesh has been made to grow and become<br>\
large: (IB, K, TA: [in the CK, مَبْنِيَّةٌ is erroneously put for مَبْنِيَّتُهُ:]) or, accord. to a learned<br>\
scholiast, this is a mistake of IB, and the meaning<br>\
is sweet in odour; i. e. sweet in the odour of the<br>\
flesh. (TA.)<br>\
بَنَاتٌ: pl. of بِنْتٌ; and sometimes of اِبْنٌ: see اِبْنٌ.<br>\
بَنُونَ: pl. of اِبْنٌ, which see below.<br>\
بُنْيَةٌ: see بِنَآءٌ.<br>\
بِنْيَةٌ A form, mode, or manner, of building or<br>\
framing or construction; a word like مِشْيَةٌُ and<br>\
رِكْبَةٌ. (T, TA.) [The form, or mode of formation, of a word.] Natural constitution: as in<br>\
the phrase, فُلَانٌ صَحِيحُ البِنْيَةِ [Such a one is<br>\
sound in natural constitution]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
بِنَآءٌ.<br>\
بِنْتِىٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\
بَنَوِىٌّ Of, or relating to, a son; rel. n. of اِبْنٌ;<br>\
as also ↓ اِبْنِىٌّ [with ا when connected with a preceding word]: (S, Msb:) the latter is allowable,<br>\
(Msb,) and used by some. (S.) And Of, or<br>\
relating to, a daughter; rel. n. of بِنْتٌ; as also<br>\
↓ بِنْتِىٌّ: (S, M, Msb, K:) the latter accord. to<br>\
Yoo; (S, M;) but rejected by Sb. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also Of, or relating to, what are termed بُنَيَّاتُ<br>\
الطَّرِيقِ, i. e., the small roads that branch off from<br>\
the main road. (S.)<br>\
بُنْيَانٌ and بُنْيَانَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
بِنَآءٌ [originally an inf. n.: (see 1, first sentence:)<br>\
then applied to A building; a structure; an edifice;] a thing that is built, or constructed; pl.<br>\
أَبْنِيَةٌ, and pl. pl. أَبْنِيَاتٌ: (M, K:) and ↓ بُنْيَانٌ<br>\
[also] has this meaning; (Msb;) [and is likewise<br>\
originally an inf. n.;] or this signifies a wall;<br>\
syn. حَائِطٌ; (S;) or it may be a pl., [or rather a<br>\
coll. gen. n., meaning buildings, structures, edifices,<br>\
or walls,] of which the sing. [or n. un.] is ↓ بُنْيَانَةٌ,<br>\
and as such may be masc. and fem: (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA:) ↓ بِنْيَةٌ and ↓ بُنْيَةٌ also signify [the same as<br>\
بِنَآءٌ as explained above; or] a thing that one has<br>\
built, framed, or constructed; (M, K;) or, accord.<br>\
to some, the former of these two relates to objects<br>\
of the senses, and the latter to objects of the mind,<br>\
to glory or honour or the like; (MF, TA;) and<br>\
their pls. are ↓ بِنًى and ↓ بُنًى; (K;) or, accord.<br>\
to the S and M, these two appear to be sings.;<br>\
(TA;) [or they may be pls. or sings.; for J says<br>\
that] البُنَى is like البِنَى; one says, بُنْيَةٌ and بُنًى,<br>\
and بِنْيَةٌ and بِنًى; (S;) [and ISd says that] بِنْيَةٌ<br>\
and بُنْيَةٌ signify as above, and so بِنًى and بُنًى;<br>\
or, accord. to Aboo-Is-hák, بِنًى is pl. of بِنْيَةٌ; or<br>\
it may be used by poetic licence for بِنَآءٌ: (M:)<br>\
accord. to IAar, بِنًى signifies buildings, or structures, of clay: and also [tents] of wool; (T;)<br>\
and بِنَآءٌ likewise signifies a tent (M, TA) in which<br>\
the Arabs of the desert dwell, in the desert, (TA,)<br>\
such as is called خِبَآء; (M, TA; *) and طِرَافٌ and<br>\
قُبَّةٌ and مِضْرَبٌ are names applied to dwellings of<br>\
the same kind; (TA;) pl. أَبْنِيَةٌ: (M:) the moveable dwelling, such as the خَيْمَة and مِظَلَّة and<br>\
فُسْطَاط and سُرَادِق and the like, is called بِنَآءٌ as<br>\
being likened to the building of burnt bricks and<br>\
of clay and of gypsum. (M.) [See also بَنِيَّةٌ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also The roof, or ceiling, of a house or<br>\
chamber or the like; as in the Kur [ii. 20],<br>\
الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الأَرْضَ فِراشًا وَ السَّمَآءَ بِنَآءً [Who hath<br>\
made for you the earth as a bed, and the heaven<br>\
as a roof, or ceiling]: (S, [but wanting in some<br>\
copies,] and Jel:) so says AZ: (S:) or the<br>\
meaning here is, as a tent (قُبَّة) pitched over you.<br>\
(Bd.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The body, with the limbs or members. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And i. q. نِطْعٌ [A thing that is<br>\
spread on the ground to serve as a table for food<br>\
&amp;c., made of leather; like مِبْنَاةٌ]: occurring in a<br>\
trad., where it is mentioned as spread on the<br>\
ground, on a day of rain, for Mohammad to pray<br>\
upon: so says Sh. (T.)<br>\
بُنَىٌّ, [said to be] originally بُنَيْوٌ, A little son;<br>\
[used as a term of endearment;] (Msb;) dim. of<br>\
اِبْنٌ. (S, Mgh, Msb.) You say, يَا بُنَىِّ and يَا بُنَىَّ<br>\
[O my little son, or O my child], with kesr to the<br>\
ى and with fet-h also; like as you say, يَا أَبَتِ<br>\
and يَا أَبَتَ [which see in art. ابو, voce أَبٌ]. (Fr,<br>\
S, K.) [The fem. is بُنَيَّةٌ A little daughter; dim.<br>\
of بِنْتٌ. And hence,] ―<br>\
-b2-  بُنَيَّاتُ الطَّرِيقَ The small<br>\
roads that branch off from the main road; (S;)<br>\
what are termed التُّرَّهَاتُ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The Arabs<br>\
say, الرِّفْقُ بُنَىُّ الحِلْمِ, meaning الرفق is like الحلم.<br>\
(IAar, ISd.)<br>\
بُنُوَّةٌ Sonship: (Lth, Zj, S, M, Msb, K:) [it may<br>\
be originally بُنُويَةٌ, for Az says, app. on the authority of Zj,] it is not a decisive proof that the last<br>\
radical is و, since they say فُتُوَّةٌ, though the dual<br>\
[of the word from which this is derived] is فَتَيَانِ;<br>\
(T;) [and ISd says that] بُنُوَّةٌ is thus because of<br>\
the dammeh. (M.)<br>\
البَنِيَّةُ [properly The building, like البِنَآءُ &amp;c.: but<br>\
particularly applied to] the Kaabeh; (S, M, K;)<br>\
because of its nobleness. (M, K.) One says,<br>\
لَا وَرَبِّ هٰذِهِ البَنِيَّةِ مَا كَانَ كَذَا وَكَذَا [No, by the<br>\
Lord of this building (the Kaabeh), such and such<br>\
thing were not]: (S, TA:) and this was a common form of oath. (TA.) The Kaabeh is also<br>\
called بَنِيَّةُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ [The building of Abraham];<br>\
because he built it. (TA.)<br>\
بَنَّآءٌ A builder; [meaning one whose business is<br>\
that of building;] an architect. (M.) [See also<br>\
what next follows.]<br>\
بَانٍ [Building, framing, or constructing]:<br>\
accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, its pl. is أَبْنَآءٌ; and in like<br>\
manner, أَجْنَآءٌ is pl. of جَانٍ: and hence the prov.,<br>\
أَبْنَاؤُهَا أَجْنَاؤُهَا, (M,) or أَجْنَاؤُهَا أَبْنَاؤُهَا, i. e. The<br>\
injurers thereof, meaning this house (هٰذِهِ الدَّار), by<br>\
demolishing it, are the builders thereof. (S in art.<br>\
جنى.) ISd says, I am of opinion that these two<br>\
pls. are not used except in this prov.: and J says,<br>\
in art. جنى, I think that the prov. is originally<br>\
جُنَاتُهَا بُنَاتُهَا; but IB affirms that it is not so: and<br>\
he says that the prov. is applied to him who does,<br>\
or makes, a thing without consideration, and<br>\
commits a fault therein, which he repairs by<br>\
undoing what he has done or made: it originated<br>\
from the fact that the daughter of a certain king<br>\
of El-Yemen, during his absence on a military<br>\
expedition, built, by the advice of others, a house,<br>\
which he, disliking it, commanded them to demolish. (TA in art. جنى. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov. i. 294.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  A bridegroom: from بَنَى عَلَى<br>\
أَهْلِهِ [q. v.]. (TA.) And hence, Any one going<br>\
in to his wife. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  قَوْسٌ بَانِيةٌ A bow<br>\
cleaving to its string (T, S, M, K) so that it (the<br>\
latter) almost breaks; (T, S, M;) the doing of<br>\
which is a fault; (M;) contr. of بَائِنَةٌ [q. v.]:<br>\
(S and M in art. بين:) and so ↓ بَانَاةٌ (T, M, K)<br>\
in the dial. of Teiyi: (T, M:) or the latter signifies widely separate from its string [like بَائِنَةٌ].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
بَانَاةٌ: see بَانٍ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (in [some of] the copies<br>\
of the K erroneously written بانات, TA,) A man<br>\
bending himself over his bow-string when shooting.<br>\
(M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Small نَبْل [or arrows]. (M and<br>\
TA in art. بين.)<br>\
بَانِيَةٌ fem. of بَانٍ [q. v.]. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also sing. of بَوَانٍ,<br>\
(TA,) which signifies The ribs of [the breast, or<br>\
of the part thereof called] the زَوْر: (M, K:) or<br>\
the bones of the breast: or the shoulder-blades<br>\
and the four legs: (TA:) and the legs of a she-camel. (M, K.) One says, [likening a man to a<br>\
camel lying down,] أَلْقَى بَوَانِيهُ, meaning He took<br>\
up his abode, and settled, (T, M, K,) in a place;<br>\
like أَلْقَى عَصَاهُ. (T, M.) أَلْقَى الشَّأْمُ بَوَانِيَهُ [meaning Syria became in a settled state] occurs in a<br>\
trad. as related by A&#39;Obeyd: and if he said<br>\
بَوَائِنَهُ, it would be allowable; بَوَائِنُ being pl. of<br>\
بوان, [i. e. بُوَانٌ or بِوَانٌ,] which is a name for<br>\
any tent-pole except in the middle of the بَيْت,<br>\
which has three poles. (T.) And it is said in<br>\
another trad., أَلْقَتِ السَّمَآءُ بِرَكَ بَوَانِيهَا, meaning<br>\
The sky cast down the rain that it contained.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
اِبْنٌ, meaning A son; (M, Mgh, K;) because<br>\
he is the father&#39;s building, made to be so by God;<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA;) and (tropical:)  a son&#39;s son; and (tropical:)  a<br>\
descendant more remote; (Msb;) is with a conjunctive ا [when not immediately preceded by a<br>\
quiescence, written ابْنٌ]; (Zj, T, M;) [and when<br>\
immediately preceded by the proper name of a<br>\
man and immediately followed by the proper<br>\
name of his parent, written without the ا, as in<br>\
زَيْدُ بْنُ عَمْرٍو Zeyd the son of &#39;Amr (in which<br>\
case it should also be observed that the former<br>\
proper name is without tenween); unless the<br>\
words compose a proposition, as in زَيْدٌ ابْنُ عَمْرٍو<br>\
Zeyd is the son of &#39;Amr; or in the case of an<br>\
interrogation, as in هَلْ زَيْدٌ ابْنُ عَمْرٍو Is Zeyd<br>\
the son of &#39;Amr?]: the pl. is ↓ بَنُونَ (T, S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb) in the nom. case, and بَنِينَ in the accus.<br>\
and gen.; (Mgh;) and أَبْنَآءٌ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K,) which is a pl. of pauc.: (Msb:) [and hence<br>\
it is argued that] the sing. is of the measure فَعَلٌ<br>\
with the final radical letter elided and the conjunctive ا prefixed; (M;) originally بَنَىٌ, (M, K,)<br>\
with ى, as we judge, because [the aor.] يَبْنِى is<br>\
more common than يَبْنُو: (M:) or originally بَنَوٌ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) with two fet-hahs, because it has<br>\
بَنُونَ for a pl., and the perfect pl. does not admit<br>\
of change [in its vowels beyond that which is here<br>\
made in بَنُونَ for بَنَوُونَ]; (Msb;) and because it<br>\
has for a pl. أَبْنَآءٌ, like as جَمَلٌ has أَجْمَالٌ; (S;)<br>\
and the elided letter is و, (Akh, T, S,) as in أَبٌ<br>\
and أَخٌ, (S,) because و is more commonly elided<br>\
than ى; (Akh, T;) or because the fem. is بِنْتٌ<br>\
and [that of أَخٌ is] أُخْتٌ; for we do not see this ه<br>\
[or ت] affixed in the fem. except when و is elided<br>\
in the masc., as is shown by أَخَوَاتٌ and هَنَوَاتٌ;<br>\
(S;) though بُنُوَّةٌ is not a decisive proof that the<br>\
last radical is و, for a reason stated above in the<br>\
explanation of it: (T:) or, as some say, it is<br>\
originally بِنْوٌ, with kesr to the. ب, like حِمْلٌ,<br>\
because they say بِنْتٌ, and a change [of a vowel]<br>\
in a case of this kind is rare: (Msb:) [but J<br>\
says,] it may not be of the measure فِعْلٌ nor فُعْلٌ,<br>\
because it has بَنُونَ with fet-h to the ب, for a pl.;<br>\
nor of the measure فَعْلٌ, because this has [generally] for its [broken] pl. أَفْعُلٌ or فُعُولٌ: (S:) Zj<br>\
says that it is originally بِنْىٌ or بِنْوٌ, or it may be<br>\
originally بَنًا; that it is app. the last accord. to<br>\
those who say بَنُون; and that أَبْنَآءٌ may be pl. of<br>\
the measure فَعَلٌ and of فِعْلٌ; that بِنْتٌ favours<br>\
its being of the latter; but that it may be of the<br>\
measure فَعَلٌ changed to فِعْلٌ, as فَعَلٌ is changed<br>\
to فُعْلٌ in the case of أُخْتٌ. (T.) Beside the pls.<br>\
mentioned above, اِبْنٌ has a quasi-pl. n., namely<br>\
↓ أَبْنَى, of the same measure as أَعْمَى; (Mgh, TA; *)<br>\
a sing. denoting the pl.: or, as some say, اِبْنٌ has<br>\
for pls. أَبْنَآءٌ and أَبْنَى. (TA.) Lh mentions the<br>\
phrase, هٰؤُلَآءِ أَبْنَا أَبْنَائِهِمْ [or أَبْنَى ابنائهم These are<br>\
the sons of their sons.]. (M.) Sometimes م is<br>\
affixed to اِبْنٌ [so that it becomes ↓ اِبْنُمٌ or اِبْنَمٌ at<br>\
the beginning of a sentence, and ↓ ابْنُمٌ or ابُنَمٌ in<br>\
other cases]: the word is then doubly declinable<br>\
[like اِمْرُؤٌ or امْرُأٌ]: you say, هٰذَا ابْنُمٌ [This is a<br>\
son], and رَأَيْتُ ابْنَمًا [I saw a son], and مَرَرْتُ بِابْنِمٍ<br>\
[I passed by a son]; making the ن similarly<br>\
declinable to the م; and the ا is with kesr in<br>\
every case [when the word commences a sentence,<br>\
whether you make the word doubly declinable or<br>\
not]: (AHeyth, * S:) [for] some make it singly<br>\
declinable, leaving the ن with fet-h in every case<br>\
[as the ر in اِمْرَأٌ or امْرَأٌ]; saying, هٰذَا ابْنَمُكَ [This<br>\
is thy son], and رَأَيْتُ ابْنَمَكَ [I saw thy son], and<br>\
مَرَرْتُ بِابْنَمِكَ [I passed by thy son]. (AHeyth,<br>\
TA.) Hassán says,<br>\
وَلَدْنَا بَنِى العَنْقَآءِ وَابْنَىْ مُحَرِّقٍ<br>\
↓ فَأَكْرِمْ بِنَا خَالًا وَأَكْرِمْ بِنَا ابْنَمَا<br>\
[We begot the sons of El-&#39;Ankà, and the two sons<br>\
of Moharrik; and how generous are we as a<br>\
maternal uncle! and how generous are we as a<br>\
son!], (S, K, *) i. e., ابْنَا: the م is augmentative,<br>\
and the hemzeh [or rather ا] is that of conjunction.<br>\
(K.) And Ru-beh says,<br>\
↓ فَهْىَ تُنَادِى بِأَبِى وَابْنِيمَا  بُكَآءَ شَكْلَى فَقَدَتْ حَمِيمَا<br>\
[As the weeping of a bereft woman, who has lost<br>\
a relation, therefore she calls out, With my<br>\
father would I ransom thee, and a son]; meaning<br>\
ابْنِمَا. (TA.) The fem. of اِبْنٌ is ↓ اِبْنَةٌ or ابْنَةٌ<br>\
[with the conjunctive ا when not commencing a<br>\
sentence] and ↓ بِنْتٌ [meaning A daughter; and<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  any female descendant]: (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K:) accord. to Sb, (M,) اِبْنَةٌ is formed from اِبْنٌ<br>\
by affixing ه [or ة]; but not so بِنْتٌ; for this is<br>\
formed by affixing ى as a letter of quasi-coordination, and then substituting for it ت: (M, K:)<br>\
[but if the ت be substituted for ى, it seems more<br>\
probable that the ى is the final radical:] or, as<br>\
some say, the ت is substituted for و: (M:) [Mtr<br>\
says,] the ت is substituted for the final radical:<br>\
(Mgh:) accord. to Ks, it is originally with ه [or<br>\
ة], because it has a fem. meaning: (IAar, Msb:)<br>\
[my own opinion is most agreeable with this of<br>\
Ks; and with that of Zj, which will be mentioned<br>\
below; or, perhaps, is identical with that of Zj:<br>\
I think it most probable that, as اِبْنٌ is generally<br>\
held to be originally بَنَىٌ or بَنَوٌ, so اِبْنَةٌ and بِنْتٌ<br>\
are both originally بَنَيَةٌ or بَنَوَةٌ, and that بِنْتٌ<br>\
is formed from اِبْنَةٌ by suppressing the alif,<br>\
transferring its kesreh to the ب, making the ن<br>\
quiescent, and changing the ة into ت, which is<br>\
therefore said to be not the sign of the fem.<br>\
gender, either because it is not ة, but is a substitute for ة, or because it is preceded by a quiescent letter:] AHn says that the ت is substituted<br>\
for the final radical letter, which is و; and that it<br>\
is not the sign of the fem. gender, because the<br>\
letter [next] before it is quiescent: this [he says]<br>\
is the opinion of Sb, and is the right opinion;<br>\
for he says that if you were to use it as the proper<br>\
name of a man, you would make it perfectly<br>\
decl.; and if the ت were to denote the fem.<br>\
gender, the name would not be perfectly decl.:<br>\
(TA:) and the same is said respecting the ت in<br>\
أُخْتٌ: (TA in art. اخو:) this ت remains in a<br>\
case of pause (Ks, IAar, S, Msb) as in the case<br>\
of the connexion of the word with a word following: (S:) but one should not say اِبِنْتٌ, (Th, T,<br>\
S.) because the ا is required only on account of<br>\
the quiescence of the ب, and is therefore dropped<br>\
when this is made movent: (S:) Zj says that, in<br>\
forming the pl. of بِنْتٌ [and of اِبْنَةٌ], the sing.<br>\
is reduced to its original form, which is فَعْلَةٌ [as<br>\
I find it written in the transcript from the T in<br>\
the TT, but it may be a mistake for فَعَلَپٌ,] with<br>\
the last radical letter suppressed: (T in TT:)<br>\
the pl. is بَنَاتٌ (T, S, Msb) alone: (S:) [and<br>\
this is generally treated as a fem. pl. of the<br>\
perfect, or sound, kind, although the ت in بِنْتٌ<br>\
is said to be not a sign of the fem. gender; so<br>\
that you say, رَأَيْتُ بَنَاتِكَ I saw thy daughters;<br>\
but sometimes] one says, رَأَيْتُ بَنَاتَكَ, with fet-h<br>\
[as the case-ending], treating the ت as a radical<br>\
letter. (S.) It is said in the Bári&#39; that when<br>\
men and women are mixed together, the masc.<br>\
pl. is made predominant; so that one says, بَنُو<br>\
فُلَانٍ [meaning The sons and daughters, or the<br>\
children, of such a one]; and even, اِمْرَأَةٌ مِنْ بَنى<br>\
تَمِيمٍ [A woman of the children of Temeem]; and<br>\
accordingly, if بَنُو فُلَانٍ is applied to denote the<br>\
persons to whom a legacy is left, the males and the<br>\
females are included therein. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  When<br>\
اِبْن is applied to that which is not a human being,<br>\
(IAmb, Msb,) to an irrational being, (Msb,) it<br>\
has for its pl. بَنَات: (IAmb, Msb:) thus the pl.<br>\
of اِبْنُ مَخَاضٍ [A young male camel in his second<br>\
year] is بَنَاتُ مَخَاضٍ: (Mgh, Msb:) that of اِبْنُ<br>\
لَبُونٍ [A male camel that has entered upon his<br>\
third year] is بَنَاتُ لَبُونٍ: (Msb:) and that of<br>\
اِبْنُ نَعْشٍ [Any one of the stars of the tail of Ursa<br>\
Major or of that of Ursa Minor] is بَنَاتُ نَعْشٍ;<br>\
but sometimes, by poetic licence, بَنُو نَعْشٍ: and<br>\
hence, or to make a distinction between the males<br>\
and the females, the lawyers say, بَنُو اللَّبُونِ.<br>\
(IAmb, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ↓ بَنَاتٌ also signifies (tropical:)  Dolls with<br>\
which young girls play: (S, Mgh, K:) sing. بِنْتٌ.<br>\
(Mgh.) It occurs in this sense in a trad., in<br>\
which &#39;Áïsheh speaks of her playing therewith<br>\
(S, Mgh) when, being nine years of age, she was<br>\
conducted as a bride to Mohammad. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
اِبْن is often prefixed to some other noun (T, M,<br>\
Msb) that particularizes its signification, because of<br>\
a close connexion between the two meanings:<br>\
(Msb:) and so is ↓ بِنْت. (T, M.) [Most of the<br>\
compounds thus formed will be found explained<br>\
in the arts. to which belong the nouns that occupy<br>\
the second place. The following are among the<br>\
more common, and are therefore here mentioned,<br>\
as exs. of different kinds.] ―<br>\
-b5-  اِبْنُ الطِّينِ [The<br>\
son of earth, or clay, meaning] Adam. (T.)<br>\
اِبْنُ اللَّيْلِ and اِبْنُ الطَّرِيقِ The thief, or robber.<br>\
(T.) Also the former, The wayfarer, or traveller;<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA;) and so اِبْنُ السَّبِيلِ. (Msb,<br>\
Er-Rághib.) اِبْنُ حَرْبٍ A warrior: (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA:) and اِبْنُ الحَرْبِ [the warrior; or] he who<br>\
suffices for war, and who defends. (Msb.) اِبْنُ<br>\
الدُّنْيَا The rich man. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اِبْنُ آوَى [The<br>\
jackal;] a certain beast of prey. (TA.) اِبْنُ عِرْسٍ<br>\
The سُرْعُوب [or weasel]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اِبْنُ أَدِيمٍ A<br>\
skin for water or milk made of one hide; and<br>\
اِبْنُ أَدِيمَيْنِ one made of two hides; and اِبْنُ ثَلَاثَهِ<br>\
آدِمَةٍ one made of three hides. (T.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اِبْنَةُ الجَبَلِ<br>\
The echo. (T.) ―<br>\
-b5-  بَنَاتُ بِئْسٍ and بَنَاتُ طَبَقٍ and<br>\
بَنَاتُ بَرْحٍ and بَنَاتُ أَوْدَكَ Calamities, or misfortunes. (T.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Ru-beh said of a man who<br>\
was mentioned to him, كَانَ إِحْدَى بَنَاتِ مَسَاجِدِ<br>\
اللّٰهِ; as though he asserted that He was one of<br>\
the pebbles of the mosque [or rather of the mosques<br>\
of God]. (S.)<br>\
اِبْنَةٌ or ابْنَةٌ: fem. of اِبْنٌ, which see.<br>\
اِبْنُمٌ and اِبْنَمٌ, or ابْنُمٌ and ابْنَمٌ: see اِبْنٌ, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
أَبْنَى: quasi-pl. n. of اِبْنٌ which see.<br>\
اِبْنَىٌّ: see بَنَوِىٌّ.<br>\
ابْنِيمَا, for ابْنِمَا: see a verse cited voce اِبْنٌ.<br>\
أُبَيْنٌ [an unused, or unusual, dim. of اِبْنٌ]: see<br>\
what next follows.<br>\
أُبَيْنٍ, of the same measure as أُعَيْمٍ, is the dim.<br>\
of أَبْنَى, which is like أَعْمَى, (Sb, IB, Mgh,) and<br>\
is quasi-pl. of اِبْنٌ. (Mgh.) Mohammad is related, in a trad., to have said, أُبَيْنِى لَا تَرْمُوا جَمْرَةَ<br>\
العَبَقَبِةِ حَتَّى تَطْلُعَ الشَّمْسُ [O little (meaning dear)<br>\
sons, cast not ye the pebble of the &#39;Akabeh (see<br>\
جَمْرَةٌ) until the sun rise], (TA,) or أُبَيْنِىَّ الخ [O<br>\
my little sons &amp;c.]: (Mgh, TA:) IAth says that<br>\
the hemzeh is augmentative; and that there are<br>\
differences of opinion respecting the form of the<br>\
word and its meaning: some say that it is the<br>\
dim. of أَبْنَى, like أَعْمَى, a sing. word denoting a<br>\
pl. meaning, or, accord. to some, a pl. of اِبْنٌ,<br>\
as well as أَبْنَآءٌ: some say that it is the dim. of<br>\
اِبْنٌ; [and if so, we must read أُبَيْنِى my little<br>\
son;] but this requires consideration [more especially as it is followed by a pl. verb]: AO says<br>\
that it is the dim. of بَنِىَّ, pl. of اِبْنٌ with the<br>\
affixed pronoun of the first pers. [sing.]; and this<br>\
requires us to read أُبَيْنِىَّ. (TA.) J says, in the<br>\
S, that the dim. of أَبْنَآءٌ [pl. of اِبْنٌ] is ↓ أُبَيْنَآءٌ, and,<br>\
if you will, ↓ أُبَيْنُونَ; and he cites a verse in<br>\
which occurs the expression أُبَيْنِيكَ, [in the gen.<br>\
case, meaning thy little sons,] and adds, it is as<br>\
though its sing. were إِبْنٌ, with the disjunctive ا,<br>\
whence the dim. ↓ أُبَيْنٌ, in the pl. أُبَيْنُونَ: but he<br>\
should have said, as though its sing. were أَبْنَى,<br>\
like أَعْمَى, originally أَبْنَوُ. (IB, TA.)<br>\
أُبَيْنَآء: see what next precedes.<br>\
أُبَيْنُونَ: see what next precedes.<br>\
مِبْنَاةٌ (T, S, M, K) and مَبْنَاةٌ (M, K) A نِطْع<br>\
[like بِنَآءٌ, which see for an explanation]: (S, M,<br>\
K:) and a سِتْر [i. e. curtain or the like]: (K:)<br>\
or a thing in the form of a سِتْر: (M:) or a [tent<br>\
of the kind called] قُبَّة, made of skins, or hides:<br>\
(IAar, T:) or a thing of skins, or hides, of like<br>\
form to the قُبَّة, which a woman places in, or at,<br>\
the side of her tent (فِى كِسْرِ بَيْتِهَا), and in which<br>\
she dwells; and may-be she has sheep, or goats,<br>\
and is content with the possession of these, exclusively of the other sheep, or goats, for herself<br>\
and her garments [and app. for making of their<br>\
skins her مبناه]; and she has a covering (إِزَار)<br>\
[extended] in the middle of the بَيْت [or tent],<br>\
within, to protect her from the heat, and from the<br>\
violent rain, so that she and her clothes are not<br>\
wetted: (Aboo-&#39;Adnán, T:) or, accord. to As, a<br>\
mat (حَصِيرٌ), or a نِطْع, which the trafficker<br>\
spreads upon the things that he sells: and they<br>\
used to put the mats (الحُصُر) upon the أَنْطَاع [pl.<br>\
of نِطْع], and go round about with them [in the<br>\
market]: the مبناة is thus called because it is made<br>\
of skins joined together: (T:) also a receptacle of<br>\
the kind called عَيْبَة: (M, K:) such is said to be<br>\
its meaning: (S:) pl. مَبَانٍ. (T.)<br>\
مَبْنِىٌّ [Built, &amp;c.: see 1]. أَرْضٌ مَبْنِيَّةٌ means<br>\
أَرْضٌ مَبْنِىٌّ فِيهَا [Land built in or upon]; and is<br>\
deemed a chaste phrase. (Mgh.)<br>\
مُبَنًّى Raised high; applied to a palace, or<br>\
pavilion. (M, TA.)<br>\
مُبْتَنًى [pass. part. n. of اِبْتَنَاهُ] is used in the<br>\
place of the inf. n. [of that verb, agreeably with<br>\
many other instances, or accord. to a common<br>\
licence], meaning The act of building, framing,<br>\
or constructing. (TA.)<br>\
