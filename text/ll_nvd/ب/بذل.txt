was liberal, or bountiful, with it; he gave it liberally, bountifully, unsparingly, or freely; (S,<br>\
Msb, K, TA;) he gave it willingly, of his own<br>\
free will or good pleasure: (TA:) and he made<br>\
it allowable, or lawful, to be taken or possessed or<br>\
done, willingly, or of his own free will or good<br>\
pleasure: (Msb:) بَذْلٌ is the contr. of مَنْعٌ. (M.)<br>\
[Hence,] سَأَلْتُهُ فَأَعْطَانِى بَذْلَ يَمِينِهِ I asked him,<br>\
and he gave me what he was able to give. (TA.)<br>\
[And بَذَلَ لَهُ نَفْسَهُ. (assumed tropical:)  He gave up himself to, or<br>\

unsparingly: (A in art. شهد: see شَاهِدٌ:) and<br>\
↓ فَرَسٌ ذُو صَوْنٍ وَابْتِذَالٍ a horse that has a running<br>\
pace (حُضْرٌ) which he has reserved for the time<br>\
of need, and a run (عَدْوٌ) less quick which he has<br>\
performed freely, or without reservation (قَدِ ابْتَذَلَهُ).<br>\

mutilated state, and with a mutilated explanation.])<br>\
And صَوْنُهُ خَيْرٌ مِنْ بَذْلِهِ (tropical:)  His interior state, or<br>\

or his honour or reputation [from disgrace]; i. q.<br>\
تَرَكَ التَّصَاوُنَ (S) or التَّصَوُّنَ; (TA;) he was careless of himself or his honour or reputation; contr.<br>\
of تَصَاوَنَ; (Msb in the present art,;) as also<br>\

يَتَبَذَّلْ [He was generous, and was not careless of<br>\

8<br>\
اِبْتِذَالٌ is the contr. of صِيَانَةٌ; (M, K;)<br>\
[i. e.] ابتذلهُ signifies He held it in mean estimation; namely, a garment or other thing; (TA;)<br>\
[he was careless of it; he used it, or employed it,<br>\
on, or for, ordinary, mean, or vile, occasions, or<br>\
purposes;] he used it for service and work;<br>\
namely, a garment &amp;c.; syn. اِمْتَهَنَهُ; (S, Msb;)<br>\
he wore it (a garment) in times of service and<br>\
work; as also ↓ بَذَلَهُ; (Msb, TA;) or, as IKoot<br>\
says, بَذَلَهُ, [aor.<br>\
بَذُلَ and<br>\
بَذِلَ,] inf. n. بَذْلَةٌ and بِذْلَةٌ,<br>\
signifies he did not preserve it, lay it up, take<br>\
care of it, or reserve it; namely, a garment.<br>\
(Msb.) See also 5, in two places. You say also,<br>\

freely, or without reservation; opposed to صَانَهُ].<br>\
(T.) See 1.<br>\
10<br>\
استبذلهُ He sought, or demanded, of him a<br>\
liberal, free, or willing, gift. (TA.) And اِسْتَبْذَلْتُ<br>\
فُلَانًا شَيْئًا I asked of such a one that he would<br>\
liberally, freely, or willingly, give me a thing. (T.)<br>\
بَذْلٌ A thing that is given liberally, freely, or<br>\
willingly: and inf. n. [or 1, q. v.], used as a proper<br>\
subst.: pl. بُذُولٌ. (Har p. 206.)<br>\
بَذْلَةٌ: see what next follows, in two places.<br>\
بِذْلَةٌ A garment that is worn (T, S, Msb) in<br>\
service, or work; (S, Msb;) that is not preserved,<br>\
laid up, taken care of, or reserved; (T, M, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ بَذْلَةٌ (Msb) and ↓ مبْذَلٌ, (T,) or ↓ مِبْذَلَةٌ,<br>\
(S, M, K,) the pl. of which is مَبَاذِلٌ: (S:) and<br>\
an old and worn-out garment; (TA;) as also<br>\
↓ مِبْذَلٌ and ↓ مِبْذَلَةٌ; (M, K;) the last of which<br>\
is mentioned on the authority of AZ, but is disapproved by &#39;Alee Ibn-Hamzeh, who asserts it<br>\
to be without ة: (IB, TA:) بِذْلَةٌ sometimes has<br>\
بِذَلٌ as pl. (TA.) You say, ↓ جَآءَ نَا فُلَانٌ فِى مَبَاذِلِه,<br>\
i. e. فِى ثِيَابِ بِذْلَتِهِ or ↓ بَذْلَتِهِ [Such a one came<br>\
to us in his garments that he wore in service, or<br>\
work]. (S, accord. to different copies. [I have<br>\
shown that بِذْلَةٌ and بَذْلَةٌ are dial. vars., both as<br>\
inf. ns. (see 8) and as proper substs.]) The word<br>\
بَدْلَةٌ, with fet-h, and with the unpointed د, applied<br>\
by the vulgar to [a suit of] new clothes, is a mistake for بِذْلَةٌ, and this is correctly a name for old<br>\
and worn-out clothes. (TA. [But this is doubtful;<br>\
for بَدْلَةٌ commonly signifies, in modern Arabic, a<br>\
change of clothes; and hence, a suit of clothes,<br>\
whether new or old.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  IJ uses it metaphorically,<br>\
in relation to poetry; saying, الرَّجَزُ إِنَّمَا يُسْتَعَانُ<br>\
بِهِ فِى البِذْلَةِ وَ عِنْدَ الاِعْتِمَالِ وَ الحُدَآءِ وَ المِهْنَةِ (tropical:)  [The<br>\
metre termed rejez is only used as an aid in the<br>\
ordinary, or meaner, business of life, and on the<br>\
occasion of doing one&#39;s work, and singing to<br>\
camels for the purpose of urging them on, and<br>\
performing service of any kind: but in this case<br>\
it may be regarded as an inf. n.: see 8]. (M.)<br>\
بَذُولٌ: see بَذَّالٌ.<br>\
بَذَالَةٌ i. q. بَذْلٌ [inf. n. of 1, The act of giving<br>\
liberally, &amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
بَذَّالٌ A man wont to give property liberally,<br>\
freely, or willingly; or who so gives it much, or<br>\
frequently; as also ↓ بَذُولٌ (T, TA) [and app.<br>\
↓ مِبْذَالٌ, (like مِسْمَاحٌ &amp;c.,) of which the pl.<br>\
occurs in the following saying]. ↓ هُمْ مَبَاذِيلُ<br>\
لِلْمَعْرُوفِ [They are very liberally disposed to the<br>\
exercise of beneficence, or bounty]. (TA.)<br>\
بَاذِلٌ Any one who gives [liberally,] freely, or<br>\
willingly. (M.)<br>\
مِبْذِلٌ: see بِذْلَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
مِبْذَلَةٌ; and its pl. مَبَاذِلُ: see بِذْلَةٌ, in three<br>\
places.<br>\
مِبْذَالٌ; pl. مَبَاذِيلُ: see بَذَّالٌ.<br>\
مُبْتَذَلٌ Held in mean estimation: as in the<br>\
saying, مَالُهُ مَصُونٌ وَ عِرْضُهُ مُبْتَذَلٌ [His wealth<br>\
is preserved, or taken care of, and his honour,<br>\
or reputation, is held in mean estimation]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  Language, and a proverb, which one is wont<br>\
to speak or mention, or which one is fond of<br>\
speaking or mentioning. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  فُلَانٌ صَدْقُ<br>\
المُبْتَذَلِ Such a one is strong, or sturdy, in the<br>\
work in which he employs himself: (T:) or<br>\
sharp, vigorous, or effective, in nature, or disposition; one who, when employed in a work,<br>\
is found to be strong, or sturdy. (TA.) And<br>\
سَيْفٌ صَدْقُ المُبْتَذَلِ (tropical:)  A sword sharp, or penetrating, in the part with which one strikes. (K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
مُبْتَذِلٌ, (K,) or ↓ مُتَبَذِّلٌ, (M, [so in a copy<br>\
of that work, accord. to the TT, but this is probably a mistranscription,]) Wearing a مِبْذَل, i. e.<br>\
[a garment used in service or work, or] an old<br>\
and worn-out garment: (M, K:) and the latter,<br>\
[if not a mistranscription for the former,] neglecting the adorning of himself, by way of humility.<br>\
(TA, from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also what follows.<br>\
مُتَبَذِّلٌ (T, M, K) and ↓ مُبْتَذِلٌ (M, K) A man<br>\
who employs his own self in doing a thing; (T;)<br>\
a man who performs his own work. (M, K.) ―<br>\
