or] his coming was late, or backward; (Msb;)<br>\
[and is app. elliptical, for ابطأ مَشْيَهُ he made his<br>\
pace, or going, slow, &amp;c.; or the like; see اسرع:]<br>\
and بَطُؤَ [denotes what is as it were an innate<br>\

عَمَلُهُ لَمْ يُسْرِعْ بِهِ نَسَبُهُ Him whom his evil deeds<br>\
keep, or hold, back, or put back, or backward, his<br>\
nobility of lineage will not profit, [or advance, or<br>\
put forward,] in the life to come, or in the world<br>\
to come. (TA.) بِكَ ↓ مَا أَبْطَأَ and مَا بَطَّأَ<br>\
signify the same [What made thee, or hath made<br>\
thee, slow? &amp;c.]; (S, TA;) and so مَا بَطَّأَكَ. (TA.)<br>\

بِهِ ↓ ابطأ; He delayed to him [the doing of] the<br>\

-b2-  أَبْطَؤُوا<br>\

slow. (AZ, S, K.) ―<br>\

tardy, &amp;c., is [he, or] it! (S.)<br>\
6<br>\

or affected, to be slow, tardy, &amp;c.: or] he was<br>\
slow, or sluggish; or he made delay; in going, or<br>\
pace: and he held back from work, or action.<br>\
(KL.) You say of a man, تباطأ فِى مَسِيرِهِ [He<br>\
feigned, or affected, to be slow, &amp;c., in his going,<br>\
course, or pace]. (S.)<br>\
10<br>\
استبطأهُ (S, TA) He deemed him, or reckoned him, slow, tardy, &amp;c. (KL.) You say,<br>\
كَتَبَ إِلَىَّ يَسْتَبْطِئُنِى [He wrote to me, deeming<br>\

بُطْءٌ inf. n. of 1. (S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One says, in<br>\
the dial. of Benoo-Yarbooa, (TA,) لَمْ أَفْعَلْهُ بُطْءًا<br>\
يَاهٰذَا, and ↓ بُطْأَى, [I never did it, lit.] I did it<br>\
not ever, O thou! i. e. الدَّهْرَ. (K, TA.)<br>\
بُطْأَى: see بُطْءٌ.<br>\
بُطْآنَ ذَا خُرُوجًا, and بَطْآنَ, (S, K,) but the<br>\
latter is extr., (TA,) i. q. ذَا خُرُوجًا ↓ بَطُؤَ [Slow,<br>\
or very slow, or how slow, is this in coming<br>\
forth!]; (S, K;) the fet-hah in [the last syllable<br>\
of] بَطُؤَ is transferred to the ن of بُطْآن, and the<br>\
dammeh of the ط [in the former] to the ب [in<br>\
the latter]; the meaning being one of wonder;<br>\
i. e. مَا أَبْطَأَهُ. (S, TA.) [بطآن is an enunciative<br>\
placed before its inchoative: and, being originally<br>\
بَطُؤَ, it may be a simple enunciative, or an enunciative having an intensive signification; as that<br>\
verb signifies simply “ it was slow,” &amp;c., and<br>\
may be used as co-ordinate to رَمُوَ, meaning “ excellent is he in his shooting! ” &amp;c., and قَضُوَ<br>\
“ excellent is he in his judging! ” &amp;c.: or it may<br>\
be equivalent to مَا أَبْطَأَ, as it is said to be in the<br>\
S. See also سَرْعَانَ.]<br>\
بَطِىْءٌ Slow, tardy, dilatory, late, or backward; applied to a man, (S, Msb, TA,) and to<br>\

المَبْطَأُ for المَبْدَأُ is mentioned by AO. (TA on<br>\
the letter ط.)<br>\
