بَرِهَ, aor.<br>\
بَرَهَ, inf. n. بَرَهٌ, or, as in some copies<br>\
of the K, بَرَهَانٌ, (TA, [and so I find in an excellent<br>\
copy of the K, but in the CK بُرْهَان,]) His body<br>\
returned to a healthy state, or his health of body<br>\
returned to him, or his bodily condition became<br>\
good, after having been altered by disease. (IAar,<br>\
K. *) [The ه is perhaps a substitute for ء: see<br>\
بَرِئَ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And He was, or became, white in person,<br>\
or body and members. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also بَرَهٌ, below.<br>\
4<br>\
ابره He adduced the evidence or proof:<br>\
(Msb, K:) but as to ↓ بَرْهَنَ, meaning he manifested the evidence or proof, it is said, on the<br>\
authority of IAar, to be post-classical; the former<br>\
being the correct word: (AA, T, Z, Msb, TA:)<br>\
or the former signifies he adduced, or uttered, or<br>\
did, wonderful things, and overcame men. (K.)<br>\
Q. Q., or, as some say, Q., 1. بَرْهَنَ: see 4;<br>\
and see art. برهن.<br>\
بَرَهٌ [perhaps an inf. n., of which the verb is<br>\
↓ بَرِهَ,] Softness, thinness of skin, and plumpness,<br>\
(K, TA,) of a woman; as also ↓ بَرَهْرَهَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
بَرْهَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
بُرْهَةٌ and ↓ بَرْهَةٌ A long space or period of time:<br>\
(JK, S:) or a long time: (ISk, K:) or they<br>\
have a more general sense; (K;) i. e. a space,<br>\
or period, of time: pl. of the former بُرَهٌ and<br>\
بُرْهَاتٌ and بُرَهَاتٌ and بُرَهَاتٌ. (Msb.) You say,<br>\
أَتَتْ عَلَيْهِ بُرْهَةٌ مِنَ الدَّهْرِ and بَرْهَةٌ [A long space<br>\
or period of time, or merely a space or period<br>\
of time, passed over him]. (S.)<br>\
بُرْهَانٌ: see art. برهن.<br>\
بَرَهْرَهَةٌ A white (IAar, JK, Msb) girl (IAar,<br>\
Msb) or female: (JK:) or a woman (S, K,)<br>\
white and youthful: or soft, or tender: (K:)<br>\
or that quivers, (K,) or almost quivers, (S,) from<br>\
sappiness, softness, or tenderness: (S,* K:) or<br>\
that shines, or glistens, by reason of her clearness<br>\
[of complexion]: or thin-skinned; appearing as<br>\
though water were running upon her, by reason<br>\
of her softness, or tenderness: (TA:) of the<br>\
measure فَعَلْعَلَةٌ, (S, TA,) from بَرَهٌ: (TA:) dim.<br>\
↓ بُرَيْهَةٌ (JK, TA) and ↓ بُرَيْرِهَةٌ, (JK,) or ↓ بُرَيْرِيهَةٌ;<br>\
but ↓ بُرَيْهِرَهَةٌ is bad, and seldom used. (TA.)<br>\
Imra-el-Keys says,<br>\
بَرَهْرَهَةٌ رُؤَدَةً رَخْصَةٌ كَخُرْعُويَةِ البَانَةِ المُنْفَطِرْ<br>\
[White, or white and youthful, &amp;c., soft, or<br>\
beautiful, tender, like the shoot of the ben-tree<br>\
breaking forth with leaves: the last word being<br>\
made masc. by poetic license, for the sake of the<br>\
metre.]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] it is said to signify also A white knife, of clear, pure, or bright,<br>\
iron. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also بَرَهٌ.<br>\
بُرَيْهَةٌ and بُرَيْهِرَهَةٌ: see بَرَهْرَهَةٌ.<br>\
بُرَيْرِهَةٌ, or بُرَيْرِيهَةٌ: see بَرَهْرَهَةٌ.<br>\
أَبْرَهُ [app.] Having the body in a healthy state,<br>\
or in good condition, after disease: and white in<br>\
person, or body and members: [but whether it<br>\
have both these significations, or only the latter<br>\
of them, is not clear:] fem. بَرْهَآءُ. (K.)<br>\
