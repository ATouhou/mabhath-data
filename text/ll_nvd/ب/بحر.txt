بَحَرَ, (TA,) [aor.<br>\
بَحَرَ,] inf. n. بَحْرٌ, (K,) He<br>\
slit; cut, or divided, lengthwise; split; or clave;<br>\
(K, TA;) and enlarged, or made wide. (TA.)<br>\
Hence the term بَحْرٌ [as meaning “ a sea ” or<br>\
“ great river ”] is said to be derived, because<br>\
what is so called is cleft, or trenched, in the<br>\
earth, and the trench is made the bed of its<br>\
water. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بَحَرَهَا, (M,) or بَحَرَ أُذُنَهَا, (S,<br>\

بَحَرَ, (M, Msb,) inf. n. بَحْرٌ, (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K,) He slit her (a camel&#39;s, S, M, A, Msb,<br>\
and a sheep&#39;s or goat&#39;s, M) ear, (S, M, A, Msb,<br>\
K,) in halves, or in halves lengthwise, (M, TA,)<br>\
widely; (B;) and in like manner, بَحَرَهُ he slit<br>\
his (a camel&#39;s) ear widely: (B:) and ↓ بحّر<br>\
آذَانَ الأَنْعَامِ, inf. n. تَبْحِيرٌ, He slit [&amp;c.] the ears<br>\

A) was, or became, salt. (S, A, * K.) ―<br>\

الأَرْضُ The land abounded with places where water<br>\
stagnated. (T, K. * [In the latter, مَنَافِعُهَا is put<br>\
by mistake for مَنَاقِعُهَا. See بَحْرَةٌ.])<br>\
-A2-  (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
found water to be salt; not easy, or pleasant,<br>\
to be drunk. (K, TA. [In some copies of the<br>\
K, for لَمْ يَسُغْ, we find لَمْ يَمْتَنِعْ, which is evidently a mistake.])<br>\
-A3-  He met, or met with, a<br>\
man unintentionally: (M, K:) from the phrase,<br>\
لَقِيتُهُ صَحْرَةَ بَحْرَةَ. (TA.)<br>\

تبحّر: see 10. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  He (a pastor) took<br>\
a wide range in abundant pasturage. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
تبحّر فِى المَالِ (tropical:)  He enlarged himself, or he<br>\
became, or made himself, ample, or abundant,<br>\
in wealth, or camels, or the like; (K, * TA;) as<br>\
also فيه↓استبحر. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  تبحّر فِى العِلْمِ (tropical:)  He<br>\
went deep into science, or knowledge, and enlarged<br>\
himself, or took a wide range, therein, (S, A, K,)<br>\

-b2-  (tropical:)  He (a poet, A, K, and a<br>\
خَطِيب, [i. e. a speaker, an orator, or the like,]<br>\
A) expatiated in speech; was, or became, diffuse<br>\
therein. (M, A, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 5, in two places.<br>\
بَحْرٌ [A sea: and a great river:] a spacious<br>\
place comprising a large quantity of water; (B;)<br>\
a large quantity of water, (K, TA,) whether salt<br>\
or sweet; (TA;) contr. of بَرٌّ; (S, A;) so called<br>\
because of its depth (S, TA) and large extent;<br>\
(S, Msb, TA;) from البَحَارَةُ; (A;) or because<br>\
its bed is trenched in the earth; see 1: (TA:)<br>\
or a large quantity of salt water, only; (K;)<br>\
and so called because of its saltness: (El-Umawee, TA: [but accord. to the A, this word<br>\
as an epithet meaning “ salt ” is tropical:]) or<br>\
rather this is its general meaning: (TA:) for<br>\
it signifies also any great river; (S, M, TA;)<br>\
any river of which the water does not cease to<br>\
flow; (Zj, T, TA;) such as the Euphrates, for<br>\
instance; (S;) or such as the Tigris, and the<br>\
Nile, and other similar great rivers of sweet<br>\
water; of which the great salt بَحْر is the place<br>\
of confluence; so called because trenched in the<br>\
earth: (T, TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَبْحُرٌ and [of<br>\
mult.] بِحَارٌ and بُحُورٌ. (S, Msb, K.) The dim.<br>\
is ↓أُبَيْحِرٌ, (K,) which is anomalous; and ↓بُحَيْرٌ,<br>\
which is the regular form: accord. to the K, the<br>\
latter is not used; but this is untrue; for it is<br>\
sometimes used, though rare. (MF.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence<br>\
its application in the saying of the Arabs, يَا هَادِىَ<br>\
اللَّيْلِ جُرْتَ إِنَّمَا هُوَ البَحْرُ أَوِ الفَجْرُ, which Th<br>\
explains by saying that the meaning is, (tropical:)  [O<br>\
guide of the night, thou hast deviated from the<br>\
right way:] it is only destruction or thou wilt<br>\
see the daybreak: the night is here likened to<br>\
the sea [and with the night is associated the idea<br>\
of destruction]: but accord. to one recital, it is<br>\
البَجْرُ, instead of البَحْرُ. (TA. [See art. بجر.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  Salt; as an epithet, applied to water.<br>\
(S, A.) ―<br>\

(As, K;) that runs much; (As, TA;) that takes<br>\
a wide range in his running; (S, A, Msb, B;)<br>\

the sea, or a great river, when it rolls wave over<br>\
wave. (Niftaweyh;, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (tropical:)  A generous man;<br>\
(K, TA;) one who takes a wide range in his<br>\
beneficence, bounty, or kindness; who abounds<br>\
therein. (TA.) You say, لَقِيتُ بِزَيْدٍ بَحْرًا (tropical:)  [I<br>\
found, in the place of Zeyd, a man of abundant<br>\
generosity or beneficence]: ب here denoting substitution. (The Lubáb cited in the TA voce بِ.)<br>\
And لَقِيتُ مِنْهُ بَحْرًا (tropical:)  [I found him to be a man<br>\
of exceeding generosity]; a phrase expressing an<br>\
intensive degree of generosity: and رَأَيْتُ مِنْهُ<br>\
بَحْرًا [signifies the same]. (Mughnee in art. بِ.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  (tropical:)  A man of extensive knowledge or science;<br>\
one who takes a wide range in his knowledge or<br>\
science. (B.) ―<br>\
-b7-  (tropical:)  Any person, or thing, that<br>\
takes a wide range in a thing. (B.) ―<br>\

of seed-produce and fruitfulness; or a tract, or<br>\
region, in which are green herbs or leguminous<br>\
plants, and waters; or the part of a country<br>\
near to water; syn. رِيفٌ: (Aboo-&#39; Alee, K:) and<br>\
the dim. ↓ بُحَيْرٌ is used in the same sense; or,<br>\
by poetic licence, for ↓ بُحَيْرَةٌ. (TA.) So in the<br>\
Kur [xxx. 40], ظَهَرَ الفَسَادُ فِى البَرِّ وَ البَحْرِ (assumed tropical:) [Corruption hath appeared in the desert, or deserts,<br>\
and in the land of seed-produce and fruitfulness;<br>\
&amp;c.]: (Aboo-&#39;Alee, TA:) or the meaning here is,<br>\
[in the desert, or deserts, and in the towns, or villages, in which is water: (see بَرٌّ:) or in the open<br>\
country and] in the cities [or towns] upon the<br>\
rivers; by sterility in the former, and scarcity<br>\
in the latter: (Zj, TA, and T in art. بر:) or in<br>\
the land and the sea; i. e., the land has become<br>\
sterile, or unfruitful, and the supply of the sea<br>\
has become cut off. (Az, TA.) See also بَحْرَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
Also, البَحْرُ, (S, K,) or بَحْرُ الرَّحِمِ, (A, Mgh,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The bottom (عُمْق, S, A, Mgh, K, or قَعْر, IAth,<br>\
TA) of the womb; fundus uteri: (S, A, Mgh,<br>\
K:) whence blood of a pure red colour, (S,) or<br>\
intensely red, (Mgh,) is termed بَحْرَانِىٌّ (S, Mgh)<br>\
and بَاحِرٌ. (S.)<br>\
بَحْرَةٌ A wide tract of land: so accord. to<br>\
Aboo-Nasr: but in one place he says, a small<br>\
valley in rugged land: pl. بِحَارٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A<br>\
land, country, or territory, belonging to, or inhabited by, a people; syn. بَلْدَةٌ. (S, K.) One<br>\
says, هٰذِهِ بَحْرَتُنَا This is our land, &amp;c.; syn. أَرْضُنَا.<br>\
(S.) It occurs also in the dim. form [↓ بُحَيْرَةٌ],<br>\
as in the Towsheeh of El-Jelál. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Any<br>\
town, or village, that has a running river and<br>\
wholesome water: (K:) and [absolutely] any<br>\
town, or village: of such the Arabs say, هٰذِهِ<br>\

بِحَارٌ they apply to cities, as well as towns,<br>\
or villages. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Low, or depressed, land:<br>\
(IAar, K:) occurring also in the dim. form<br>\
[↓ بُحَيْرَةٌ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  A meadow; or a garden;<br>\
syn. رَوْضَةٌ: (T, TA:) or one that is large, (K,)<br>\

-b7-  The pl. is ↓ بَحْرٌ, (as in some<br>\
copies of the K, [or this is a coll. gen. n. of which<br>\
بَحْرَةٌ is the n. un.,]) or بِحَرٌ, (as in other copies<br>\
of the K and in the TA,) or بُحْرٌ, (as in the CK,)<br>\
and بِحَارٌ. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  لَقِيتُهُ صَحْرَةَ بَحْرَةَ, (S, K,) and<br>\
↓ صُحْرَةَ بُحْرَةَ, as in the Expositions of the Tesheel, &amp;c., (MF,) and صَحْرَةً بَحْرَةً, (K,) and<br>\
↓ صُحْرَةً بُحْرَةً, (MF,) I met him out, with nothing<br>\
intervening between me and him; (S, L;) both<br>\
of us being exposed to open view; (TA;) without<br>\
anything concealing, or intervening. (K, TA.)<br>\
صحرةَ بحرةَ, without tenween, is a compound<br>\
denotative of state; not, as some say, consisting<br>\
of two inf. ns.: and sometimes نَحْرَةً is added;<br>\
in which case each of the three words is with tenween, decl.; and they do not form a compound.<br>\
(MF. [But see صَحْرَة.)]<br>\
صُحْرَةَ بُحْرَةَ and صُحْرَةً بُحْرَةً: see بَحْرَةٌ.<br>\

-b3-  [In the dial. of Egypt, North;<br>\
northern; because the Mediterranean Sea lies<br>\
on the north of that country: like as, in Hebrew,<br>\
יָ� signifies “ west; ” because that sea lies on the<br>\
west of Palestine.]<br>\
بَحْرِيَّةٌ: see بَحْرِىٌّ.<br>\
بُحْرَانٌ, a post-classical word, (S, K,) used by<br>\
the physicians, signifying The crisis of a disease;<br>\
the sudden change which happens to a sick person,<br>\
(S, TA,) and the commencement of convalescence,<br>\
(TA,) in acute diseases; (S, TA;) at a time<br>\
fixed by some motion in the heavenly bodies,<br>\
mostly by a motion of the moon; being a change<br>\
to health or to the contrary: a word [said to be]<br>\
of Greek origin. (The Nuzheh of the sheykh<br>\
Dáwood El-Antákee, cited in the TA.) [Pl.<br>\
بَحَارِينُ.] They say, هٰذَا يَوْمُ بُحْرَانٍ and يَوْمٌ<br>\
↓ بَاحُورِىٌّ [This is the day of a crisis of a disease]:<br>\
باحورىّ being anomalous: (S, K:) [perhaps from<br>\
البَاحُورُ signifying “ the moon,” because the crisis<br>\
of a disease is thought to be mostly fixed by a<br>\
motion of the moon: or] as though it were a<br>\
rel. n. of بَاحُورٌ and بَاحُورَآءُ meaning the “ vehemence of heat in [the month of] تَمُّوز. ” (S.)<br>\
دَمٌ بَحْرَانِىٌّ (assumed tropical:)  Blood of the menses; accord. to<br>\
El-Kutabee: or (assumed tropical:)  intensely red blood: (Mgh:)<br>\
or (assumed tropical:)  intensely red, and thick, and abundant, menstrual blood: (IAth:) or (tropical:)  black blood: (A:)<br>\
or, as also ↓ دَمٌ بَاحِرٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) (assumed tropical:)  blood of<br>\
the womb: (K:) or (assumed tropical:)  blood of a pure red colour:<br>\
(S, M, K:) or (assumed tropical:)  such blood from the belly: (M:)<br>\
or (assumed tropical:)  pure blood of an intensely red colour:<br>\
(Msb:) both from البَحْرُ signifying “ the bottom<br>\
of the womb: ”: (S:) the former is a rel. n. therefrom, (A, IAth, Msb,) in which the ا and ن are<br>\
added to give intensiveness to the signification,<br>\
(IAth,) or to distinguish it from the rel. n. of<br>\
البَحْرُ [in its most common sense]: (Msb:) or<br>\
it is a rel. n. of البَحْرُ [in its most common sense],<br>\
because of its abundance. (IAth.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَحْمَرُ<br>\
بَحْرَانِىٌّ, and ↓ بَاحِرٌ, (TA,) and ↓ بَاحِرِىٌّ, (IAar,<br>\

بَحِيرَةٌ A she-camel having her ear slit: (S, *<br>\
A, Msb, K *:) [and, as a subst., or an epithet in<br>\
which the quality of a subst. is predominant,]<br>\
a she-camel of which the mother was a سَائِبَة;<br>\
(Fr, S, Mgh, Msb, K;) i. e., of which the mother<br>\
had brought forth ten females consecutively before<br>\
her, and of which the ear was slit; (Mgh;) or<br>\
of which the mother had brought forth five, of<br>\
which five the last, if a male, was slaughtered and<br>\
eaten, but if a female, her ear was slit and she<br>\
was left with her mother; (Mgh, * Msb;) the<br>\
predicament of which was the same as that of<br>\
her mother; (Fr, S, K;) i. e., what was unlawful with respect to her mother was unlawful with<br>\
respect to herself: (TA:) or a she-camel, or ewe,<br>\
or she-goat, that had brought forth five young<br>\
ones, and of which the fifth, if a male, was<br>\
slaughtered, and its flesh was eaten by the men<br>\
and women; but if a female, her ear was slit,<br>\
and it was unlawful to the Arabs to eat her flesh<br>\
and to drink her milk and to ride her; but when<br>\
she died, her flesh was lawful to the women: (K:)<br>\
so says Az, on the authority of Ibn-&#39;Arafeh:<br>\
(TA: [but it appears from the explanation in the<br>\
Msb, quoted above, that it was the slit-eared<br>\
young she-camel here mentioned, not the mother,<br>\
that was thus termed:]) or a she-camel, or ewe,<br>\
or she-goat, which, having brought forth ten<br>\
young ones, had her ear slit, (K,) and no use<br>\
was made of her milk nor of her back, (TA,)<br>\
and she was left at liberty to pasture, (K,) and<br>\
to go to water, (TA,) and her flesh, when she died,<br>\
was made unlawful to the women of the Arabs,<br>\
but was eaten by the men: (K:) or one that<br>\
was left at liberty, without a pastor: (K:) or,<br>\
as some say, syn. with سَائِبَةٌ; i. e., say they, a<br>\
she-camel which, having brought forth seven young<br>\
ones, had her ear slit, and was not ridden, nor<br>\
used for carrying: (Msb:) or a she-camel that<br>\
had brought forth five young ones, the last of<br>\
which was a male, in which case her ear was slit,<br>\
and she was exempted from being ridden and<br>\
from carrying and from being slaughtered, and<br>\
not prevented from taking of any water to which<br>\
she came, nor from any pasturage, nor even<br>\
ridden by a weary man who, having become unable to proceed in his journey, his means having<br>\
failed him, or his camel that bore him stopping<br>\
with him from fatigue or breaking down or<br>\
perishing, might chance to find her: (Aboo-Is-<br>\
hák the Grammarian, TA: [and the like, but<br>\
less fully, is said in the Mgh:]) or, applied<br>\
specially to a ewe, or she-goat, one that, having<br>\
brought forth five young ones, had her ear slit:<br>\
(L, K, TA: [in the CK, for بُحِرَت is put<br>\
نُحِرَت:]) it also signifies a she-camel (L) abounding in milk: (L, K:) the pl. is بَحَائِرُ and بُحُرٌ;<br>\
(L, K;) the latter a strange form of pl. of a fem.<br>\
sing. such as بحيرة; and said to be the only instance<br>\
of the kind except صُرُمٌ pl. of صَرِيمَةٌ, meaning<br>\
“ having her ear cut off. ” (TA.) It is said in a<br>\
trad., that the person who instituted the practices<br>\
relative to the بحيرة and the حَامِى, and the first<br>\
who altered the religion of Ishmael, was &#39;Amr the<br>\
son of Loheí the son of Kama&#39;ah the son of<br>\
Jundab; and these practices are forbidden in the<br>\
Kur v. 102. (TA.)<br>\
بُحَيْرَةٌ A small sea; a lake: as though they<br>\
