بُطْلٌ and بُطُولٌ and بُطْلَانٌ, [of which the last<br>\
seems to be the most common,] (S, Msb, K, KL,<br>\

naught, futile, worthless, useless, unprofitable,<br>\
(KL, PS,) devoid of virtue or efficacy, ineffectual, null, void, of no force, or of no account;<br>\

account, (S, Msb, K,) or as a thing that had<br>\
perished or become lost. (K.) [It is said of an<br>\
assertion or allegation and the like, and of a deed,<br>\
&amp;c.] Hence the saying in the Kur [vii. 115],<br>\
وَ بَطَلَ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ [And what they were<br>\
doing became vain, or null; or went for nothing,<br>\
as a thing of no account]. (TA.) And ذَهَبَ<br>\
دَمُهُ بُطْلًا His blood went for nothing, [unretaliated, and uncompensated by a mulet,] as a<br>\
thing of no account. (S, Msb.) And بَطَلَ دَمُهُ<br>\

there being obtained for him either blood-revenge<br>\
or blood-wit. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\

KL) and بِطَالَةٌ, which is mentioned by one of<br>\
the expositors of the Mo&#39;allakát, and said to be<br>\
the more chaste, and sometimes one says بُطَالَةٌ, to<br>\
make it accord with its contr. عُمَالَةٌ, (Msb,) He<br>\
(a hired man, or hireling,) was, or became, idle,<br>\
unoccupied, or without work. (S, Msb, * K, KL.<br>\
[See also 5.]) [Hence, يَوْمُ بَطَالَةٍ A day of idleness; a holiday.] ―<br>\
