And بَطَنَتْ بِهِ الحُمَّى The fever produced an<br>\
effect within him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He entered into it;<br>\
namely, a valley; (S, TA;) in which sense it<br>\
has for its inf. n. بَطْنٌ; and ↓ تبطّنهُ signifies the<br>\
same: or the latter, he went about in it; namely,<br>\
the valley; as also ↓ استبطنهُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  (tropical:)  [He<br>\

wrong. (TA.)<br>\

He bound, or made fast, the camel&#39;s بِطَان [or<br>\
belly-girth]; (S, K;) as also ↓ بطّنهُ, accord. to<br>\
the copies of the K; but this is a mistake for<br>\
↓ بَطَنَهُ, aor.<br>\
بَطُنَ, inf. n. بَطْنٌ; which last verb,<br>\
however, though said by Az to be a dial. var.,<br>\

a mistranscription for خَصَصْتُهُ; meaning (assumed tropical:)  I took,<br>\
or chose, such a one particularly, or specially,<br>\

special companion, or putting it beneath my waist;<br>\

printed in his Lex.) by “ peperit camela decem<br>\
vicibus. ”])<br>\

-b3-  استبطنهُ He, or it, entered [or<br>\
penetrated] into his, or its, belly, or interior; [or<br>\
was, or became, or lay, within it;] like as the<br>\

الشَّىْءَ [I entered, or penetrated, into the thing,<br>\
whether actually or mentally]. (S.) See 1, in<br>\
two places. ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 4, in two places. ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
اِسْتِبْطَانٌ also signifies The having, or holding,<br>\
[a thing] concealed within. (PS.) [This explanation seems to be given to show that, in the<br>\
opinion of the author of the PS, اِسْتَبْطَنْتُ الشَّىْءَ<br>\
in the S means I had, or held, the thing concealed<br>\
within.]<br>\
بَطْنٌ The belly, or abdomen; i. e. the part of<br>\
the body which is separated from the جَوْف [i. e.<br>\
chest, or thorax,] by the حِجَاب [i. e. midriff, or<br>\
diaphragm]; containing the liver and the spleen<br>\
and the stomach and the lower intestines &amp;c.; (Zj<br>\

of mult., applied to more than ten. (Az, TA.)<br>\
[Hence,] ذُو البَطْنِ [What is in the belly: but<br>\
generally meaning] excrement, ordure, or dung.<br>\
(K, TA.) You say, أَلْقَى ذَا بَطْنِهِ He (a man)<br>\
ejected his excrement, or ordure. (TA.) And<br>\
أَلْقَتْ ذَا بَطْنِهَا She (a woman, TA) brought forth;<br>\
(K;) as also وَضَعَتْ ذَاتَ بَطْنِهَا: (TA in art. ذو:)<br>\
and she (a hen) laid an egg. (K.) And نَثَرَتْ ذَا<br>\
بَطْنِهَا, (T and Mgh in art. نثر,) and [elliptically]<br>\
نَثَرَتْ بَطْنَهَا, (T and A and Mgh in that art.,) She<br>\
(a woman) brought forth many children. (T in<br>\
that art.) And it is said in a prov., (TA,) الذِّئْبُ<br>\
يُغْبَطُ بِذِى بَطْنِهِ [The wolf is envied for what is<br>\
in his belly]: for one never thinks him to be<br>\
hungry, but only thinks him to be in a state of<br>\
repletion, because of his hostility to men and<br>\
cattle, (A&#39;Obeyd, K,) though he is sometimes<br>\
distressed by hunger. (A&#39;Obeyd. [See various<br>\
readings of this prov. in Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov.<br>\
i. 500 and 501.]) مَاتَتْ فِى بَطْنٍ, a phrase occurring in a trad., means She (a woman) died in<br>\
childbirth. (TA.) See also فُلَانٌ ابْنُ بَطْنِهِ. بَطَنٌ.<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is solicitous for his belly. (Er-Rághib, TA in art. بنى.) [Many phrases in which<br>\
the word بَطْن occurs will be found explained<br>\
under other words of those phrases; as ظَهْرٌ, and<br>\
أَخَذَ, and عُصْفُورٌ, &amp;c.] بَطْنُ الحُوتِ: see الرِّشَآءُ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also The inside, or interior, of anything;<br>\
syn. جَوْفٌ: and so ↓ بَاطِنٌ; syn. دَاخِلٌ: (K:) pl.<br>\
of the former as above. (TA.) Thus بَطْنُ وَادٍ<br>\

occasionally or constantly, its torrent or river].<br>\
(MA.) And بَطْنُ مَكَّةَ means The interior of<br>\
Mekkeh. (Bd in xlviii. 24.) [Hence,] it is said<br>\
of the Kur-án, لِكُلِّ آيَةٍ مِنْهَا ظَهْرٌ وَ بَطْنٌ, meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  To every verse thereof is an apparent sense and<br>\
a sense requiring development. (TA.) [See ظَهْرٌ.]<br>\
See also بَاطِنٌ. [And its pl. بُطْنَانٌ is also used as<br>\
a sing., meaning The middle, or midst, of a<br>\
thing: and the lower, or lowest, part, or the<br>\
foundation. Thus,] بُطْنَانُ الجَنَّةِ means The<br>\
middle, or midst, of Paradise: (S, TA:) and<br>\
بُطْنَانُ العَرْشِ, The lower, or lowest, part, or the<br>\

throne of God]. (TA.) You say also [بَطْنُ الكَفِّ<br>\
and] الكَفِّ ↓ بَاطِنُ (assumed tropical:)  The palm of the hand [opposed<br>\

الحَافِرِ ↓ بَاطِنُ (M and K in that art.) (assumed tropical:)  [The sole<br>\
of the solid hoof;] the part of the solid hoof in<br>\
which is the نَسْر, q. v. (S and M and K in that<br>\
art.) بَطْنُ الرَّاحَةِ is well known [as another name<br>\
for بَطْنُ الكَفِّ, explained above; for الرَّاحَة is often<br>\
used as syn. with الكَفّ]: and الخُفِّ ↓ بَاطِنُ is<br>\
[said to be] (assumed tropical:)  The part of the foot of a camel or<br>\
the like that is next the leg: and one says, ↓ بَاطِنُ<br>\
الإِبْطِ, [meaning (assumed tropical:)  The armpit, or hollow of the<br>\
inner side of the shoulder-joint,] but not بَطْنُ<br>\
الإِبْطِ: (TA:) [and العُنُقِ ↓ بَاطِنُ the throat.] The<br>\
بَطْن of a feather is (tropical:)  The long, (S,) or longer,<br>\

or depressed, tract, or portion, of land, or ground;<br>\
(S, TA;) and so ↓ بَاطِنٌ: (TA:) [or a bottom,<br>\
or low land; or a low, soft flat; i. e.] soft, plain,<br>\

other authority:]) of the masc. gender: (TA:)<br>\
or [properly] fem.: but if حَيٌّ [said by some to<br>\
signify a tribe, absolutely,] be meant thereby, it<br>\
is masc.: (Msb:) or fem. if used in the sense of<br>\
قَبِيلَة: (TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَبْطُنٌ and [of mult.]<br>\
بُطُونٌ. (Msb, K.) [See شَعْبٌ.]<br>\
بَطَنٌ Disease of the belly, (K, TA,) being a<br>\

(S,) ever large, or big, in the belly in consequence<br>\
of much eating: (S, TA:) or ↓ both signify voracious; not ceasing from eating. (K.) ―<br>\

Arab. Prov. ii. 601.])<br>\
بَطِينٌ, applied to a man, (K,) Big, or large, in<br>\

the form of an equilateral triangle, (S,) as though<br>\
they were three stones whereon a cooking-pot is<br>\
placed, and forming the belly of the Ram; (S,<br>\
K;) the appellation being made a diminutive<br>\
because the Ram consists of many stars in the<br>\
form of a ram; [so I here render حَمَل though it<br>\
properly signifies a lamb;] the شَزَطَانِ being its<br>\
two horns; and the بُطَيْن, its belly; [or, accord.<br>\
to our configuration of Aries, the rump;] and the<br>\
