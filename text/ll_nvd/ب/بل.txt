بَلُ3َ,<br>\
(T, M,) inf. n. بَلٌّ (with fet-h, TA [in the CK it<br>\
has kesr]) and بِلَالٌ, (M, K,) (tropical:)  He made close [or<br>\
he refreshed] his ties of relationship by behaving<br>\
with goodness and affection and gentleness to his<br>\
kindred; syn. وَصَلَهَا, (T, S, M, K,) and نَدَّاهَا:<br>\
(T:) for, as some things are conjoined and commixed by moisture, and become disunited by<br>\
dryness, بَلٌّ is metaphorically used to denote conjunction, as above, and يُبْسٌ to denote the contrary. (TA.) A poet says,<br>\
وَالرِّحْمَ فابْلُلْهَا بِخَيْرِ البُلَّانْ<br>\
فَإِنَهَااشْتُقَّتْ مِنِ اسْمِ الرَّحْمٰنْ<br>\
[(tropical:)  And the ties of relationship, make thou them<br>\
close &amp;c. by the best mode, or modes, of doing so;<br>\
for the name thereof is derived from the name of<br>\
the Compassionate]: here ↓البُلَّان may be a noun<br>\
in the sing. number, like غُفْرَانٌ, or it may be<br>\
pl. of بَلَلٌ, which may be either a subst. or an.<br>\
inf. n., for some inf. ns. have pls., as شُغْلٌ and<br>\
عَقْلٌ and مَرَضٌ. (M.) And it is said in a trad.,<br>\
بُلُّوا أَرْحَامَكُمْ وَلَوْ بِالسَّلَامِ (tropical:)  Make ye close [or<br>\
refresh ye] your ties of relationship &amp;c., though<br>\
but,  or if only, by salutation; syn. صِلُوهَا, (M,)<br>\
or نَدُّوهَا بِالصِّلَةِ. (S.) And hence the saying in<br>\
another trad., إِذَ اسْتَشَنَّ مَا بَيْنَكَ وَ بَيْنَ اللّٰهِ فَابْلُلْهُ<br>\
بِالإِحْسَانِ إِلَى عِبَادَهِ (tropical:)  [When the tie between thee<br>\

thou it, by beneficence to his servants]. (TA.)<br>\

ابْنًا, (M, K,) (assumed tropical:)  May God give thee a son. (S, M,<br>\
K, TA.) Hence, perhaps, the phrase, بُلَّتْ يَدَاكَ بِهِ<br>\
as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Thou was given it. (Har p. 479.)<br>\
You say also, بَلَلْتُهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  I gave to him.<br>\

straying; syn. هَمَتْ ضَالَّةً. (Fr, T, K, TA. [In<br>\
the CK, همت, which, as is said in the TA, is<br>\
without teshdeed, is written هَمَّتْ.])<br>\
-A3-  بَلِلْتُ مِنْهُ,<br>\
(As, T, S, &amp;c.,) inf. n. بَلَلٌ, (M,) I got him; got<br>\
possession of him; (As, T, S, M, K;) got him in<br>\
my hand. (S.) One says, لَئِنْ بَلَّتْ بِكَ يَدِى لَا<br>\

hold of thee, thou shalt not quit me unless thou<br>\

hence the prov., مَا بَلَلْتُ مِنْ فُلَانٍ بِأَفْوَقَ نَاصِلٍ [I<br>\
did not get, in such a one, a man like an arrow<br>\
with a broken notch and without a head]; meaning I got a perfect man; one sufficient. (Sh, T.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, (T,) or بَلِلْتُهُ, (M, K,) I kept, or clave, to<br>\

بَلْ is a particle of digression: (Mughnee, K:)<br>\
or, accord. to Mbr, it denotes emendation, wherever it occurs, in the case of a negation or an<br>\
affirmation: (T, TA:) or it is a word of emendation, and denoting digression from that which<br>\
precedes; as also بَنْ, in which the ن is a substitute for the ل, because بل is of frequent occurrence,<br>\
and بن is rare; or, as IJ says, the latter may be<br>\
an independent dial. var. (M.) When it is followed by a proposition, the meaning of the digression is either the cancelling of what precedes, as<br>\
in وَقَالُوا اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمٰنُ وَلَدًا سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُكْرَمُونَ<br>\
[And they said, “The Compassionate hath gotten<br>\
offspring: ” extolled be his freedom from that which<br>\
is derogatory from his glory! nay, or nay rather, or<br>\
nay but, they are honoured servants (Kur xxi. 26)],<br>\
or transition from one object of discourse to another, as in قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَنْ تَزَكَّى وَ ذَكَرَ اسْمَ رَبِّهِ فَصَلَّى<br>\
بَلْ تُؤْثِرُونَ الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا [He hath attained felicity<br>\
who hath purified himself, and celebrated the<br>\
name of his Lord, and prayed: but ye prefer the<br>\
present life (Kur lxxxvii. 14-16)]: (Mughnee,<br>\
K: *) and in all such cases it is an inceptive particle; not a conjunctive. (Mughnee.) When it<br>\
is followed by a single word, it is a conjunction,<br>\
(S, * Msb, * Mughnee, K,) and requires that word<br>\
to be in the same case as the word before it: (S:)<br>\
and if preceded by a command or an affirmation,<br>\
(Mughnee, K,) as in اِضْرَبْ زَيْدًا بَلْ عَمْرًا [Beat<br>\
thou Zeyd: no, &#39;Amr], (Msb, Mughnee, K,) and<br>\
قَامَ زَيْدٌ بَلْ عَمْرٌو [Zeyd stood: no, &#39;Amr], (M,<br>\
Mughnee, K,) or جَآءَنِى أَخُوكَ بَلْ أَبُوكَ [Thy<br>\
brother came to me: no, thy father], (S,) it<br>\
makes what precedes it to be as though nothing<br>\
were said respecting it, (S, * Msb, * Mughnee, K,)<br>\
making the command or affirmation to relate to<br>\
what follows it: (S, * Msb, * Mughnee:) [and<br>\
similar to these cases is the case in which it is<br>\
preceded by an interrogation: see أَمْ as syn. with<br>\
this particle:] but when it is preceded by a negation or a prohibition, it is used to confirm the<br>\
meaning of what precedes it and to assign the<br>\
contrary of that meaning to what follows it,<br>\
(Mughnee, K,) as in مَا قَامَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرٌو [Zeyd<br>\
stood not, but &#39;Amr stood], (Mughnee,) or مَا<br>\
رَأَيْتُ زَيْدًا بَلْ عَمْرًا, [I saw not Zeyd, but I saw<br>\
&#39;Amr], (S,) and لَا يَقُمْ زَيْدٌ بَلْ عَمْرٌو [Let not<br>\
Zeyd stand, but let &#39;Amr stand]. (Mughnee.)<br>\
Mbr and &#39;Abd-El-Wárith allow its being used to<br>\
transfer the meaning of the negation and the prohibition to what follows it; so that, accord. to<br>\
them, one may say, مَازَيْدٌ قَائِمًا بَلْ قَاعِدًا [as<br>\
meaning Zeyd is not standing: no, is not sitting],<br>\
and بَلْ قَاعِدٌ [but is sitting]; the meaning being<br>\
different [in the two cases]. (Mughnee, K. *)<br>\
The Koofees disallow its being used as a conjunction after anything but a negation [so in the<br>\
Mughnee, but in the K a prohibition,] or the like<br>\
thereof; so that one should not say, ضَرَبْتُ زَيْدًا<br>\
بَلْ إِيَّاكَ [I beat Zeyd: no, thee]. (Mughnee,<br>\
K.) Sometimes لَا is added before it, to corroborate the meaning of digression, after an affirmation,<br>\
as in the saying,<br>\
وَجْهُكَ البَدْرُ لَا بَلِ الشَّمْسُ لَوْ لَمْ<br>\
يُقْضَ لِلشَّمْسِ كَسْفَةٌ وَ أُفُولُ<br>\
[Thy face is the full moon: no, but it would be<br>\
the sun, were it not that eclipse and setting are<br>\
appointed to happen to the sun]: and to corroborate what precedes it, after a negation, as in<br>\
وَ مَا هَجَرْتُكَ لَا بَلْ زَادَنِى شَغَفًا<br>\
هَجْرٌ وَ بَعْدٌ تَرَاخَى لَا إِلَى أَجَلِ<br>\
[And I did not abandon thee, or have not abandoned thee: no, but abandonment and distance,<br>\
protracted, not to an appointed period, increased,<br>\
or have increased, my heart-felt love]. (Mughnee,<br>\
K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  Sometimes it is used to denote the passing<br>\
from one subject to another without cancelling<br>\
[what precedes it], and is syn. with وَ, as in the<br>\
saying in the Kur [lxxxv. 20 and 21], وَاللّٰهُ مِنْ,<br>\
وَ رَائِهِمْ مُحِيطٌ بَلْ هُوَ قُرْآنٌ مَجِيدٌ [And God from<br>\
behind them is encompassing: and it is a glorious<br>\
Kur-án: or here it may mean إِنَّ, as in an ex.<br>\
below]: and to this meaning it is made to accord<br>\
in the saying, لَهُ عَلَىَّ دِينَارٌ بَلْ دِرْهَمٌ [I owe him<br>\
a deenár and a dirhem]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  In the fol-<br>\
lowing saying in the Kur [xxxviii. 1],وَالْقُرْآنِ ذِى<br>\
الذِّكْرِبَلِ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فِى عِزَّةٍ وَشِقَاقٍ, it is said<br>\
to signify إِنَّ; [so that the meaning is, By the<br>\
Kur-án possessed of eminence, verily they who<br>\
have disbelieved are in a state of pride and opposition;] therefore the oath applies to it. (Akh,<br>\
S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Sometimes the Arabs use it in breaking off<br>\
a saying and commencing another; and thus a<br>\
man commences with it a citation, or recitation,<br>\
of verse; in which case, it does not form any part<br>\
of the first verse, but is a sign of the breaking off,<br>\
or ending, of what precedes. (Akh, S.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Sometimes it is put in the place of رُبَّ, (S, Mughnee,)<br>\
as in the saying of the rájiz,<br>\
بَلْ مَهْمَهٍ قَطَعْتُ بَعْدَ مَهْمَهٍ<br>\
[Many a far-extending desert have I traversed,<br>\
after a far-extending desert]. (S: [and a similar<br>\
ex. is given in the Mughnee.]) ―<br>\
-b6-  What is deficient in this word [supposing it to be originally<br>\
of three letters] is unknown; and so in the cases<br>\
of هَلْ and قَدْ: it may be a final و or ى or<br>\
they may be originally بَلّ and هَلّ and قَدّ.<br>\
(Akh, S.)<br>\
[<br>\
بَلٌّ Moist, or containing moisture: or rather<br>\
moistened; being, app., an inf. n. used in the<br>\
sense of a pass. part. n. ; like خَلْقٌ in the sense<br>\
of مَخْلُوقٌ. Hence,] رِيحٌ بَلَّةٌ and ↓بَلِيلٌ and<br>\

M:) or it is an imitative sequent to حِلٌّ, (M, K,)<br>\
as some say: (M:) so As thought until he heard<br>\
that it was said to be of the dial. of Himyer in<br>\
the first of the senses explained above: (S, M:)<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd and ISk say that it may not be so<br>\
because it is conjoined with حِلٌّ by وَ: (T:) and<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd says, We have seldom found an imitative sequent conjoined by و. (TA.) Hence the<br>\
phrase, هُوَ لَكَ حِلٌّ وَبِلٌّ It is to thee lawful and<br>\
allowable: or lawful and a remedy. (M, K. *)<br>\
