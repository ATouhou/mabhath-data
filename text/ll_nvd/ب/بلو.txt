بَلَاهُ, (T, S, Mgh, Msb,) aor.<br>\
بَلُوَ, (T, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. بَلَآءٌ, (S,) or this is a simple subst., and the<br>\
inf. n. is بَلْوٌ, (T, Msb,) He (God) tried, proved,<br>\
or tested, him, (T, S, Msb,) بِخَيْرٍ [by, or with,<br>\
good], or بِشَّرٍ [by, or with, evil]; (Msb;) for<br>\
God tries his servant (يَبْلُوهُ) by, or with, a<br>\
benefit, to test his thankfulness; and by, or with,<br>\
a calamity, to test his patience; (T;) [wherefore<br>\
it often means He afflicted him;] as also ↓ ابلاهُ,<br>\
(T, S, Msb,) inf. n. إِبْلَآءٌ; (T, S; [in both restrieted<br>\
to good; but in the Msb it seems to be common<br>\
to good and evil;]) and ↓ ابتلاه: (T, S, M, Msb:)<br>\
and بَلَوْتُهُ, inf. n. بَلْوٌ (S, M, K) and بَلَآءٌ, (M, K,)<br>\
[but from what has been said above, it seems that<br>\
the latter is used only when the agent is God,<br>\
and that it is properly a simple subst.,] I tried,<br>\
proved, or tested, him; (S, M, Mgh, * K;) as also<br>\
↓ اِبْتَلَيْتُهُ: (M, K:) each of these verbs implying<br>\
two things; one of which is the learning the<br>\
state, or condition, of the object, and becoming<br>\
acquainted with what was unknown of the case<br>\
thereof; and the other, the manifesting of the<br>\
goodness or badness thereof; both of these things<br>\
being sometimes meant, and sometimes only one<br>\
of them, as when God is the agent, in which case<br>\
only the latter is meant: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and<br>\
↓ التَّبَالِى, also, signifies the act of trying, proving,<br>\
or testing. (S.) It is said in the Kur [xxi. 36],<br>\
وَنَبْلُوكُمْ بِالشَّرِ وَالخَيْرِ فِتْنَةً [And we try you by,<br>\
or with, evil and good, by way of probation].<br>\
(TA.) And in the same [ii. 118], ↓ وَإِذَ ابْتَلَى<br>\
إِبْرَاهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلَمَاتٍ [And when his Lord tried<br>\
Abraham by certain words, meaning commands<br>\
and prohibitions]. (TA.) And you say, ↓ لَا تُبْلِنَا<br>\
إِلَّا بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ [Try Thou not us save by<br>\
those things that are best]; (T;) from a trad.<br>\
(TA.) [See also 4 and 8 below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
بَلَوْتُهُ also signifies (tropical:)  I smelt it. (T in art. بول,<br>\
and A and TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And بَلَاهُ He knew it, or became acquainted with it. (See بَالٍ.)] ―<br>\

-A2-  بَلِى,<br>\
aor.<br>\
بَلَوَ, inf. n. بِلًا, or بِلًى, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
بَلًى,] and بَلَآءٌ, [in the CK, erroneously, بِلاء,] (T,<br>\
S, M, Msb, K,) the former with kesr and the<br>\
latter with fet-h, (T, S, Msb,) said of a garment,<br>\
(T, S, M, &amp;c.,) It was, or became, old, and worn<br>\
out: (Msb:) belonging to the present art. and to<br>\
art. بلى. (M.) [The inf. n., used as a subst.,<br>\
signifies Wear; attrition; wear and tear: see<br>\
an ex. in a hemistich cited near the end of the<br>\
first paragraph of art. الا, where a dwelling is<br>\
likened to a garment.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also said of a plant [as<br>\
meaning It became old and withered, or wasted].<br>\
(K in art. عنث, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And of a corpse, meaning<br>\
It became consumed by the earth. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
of a bone, meaning It became old, and decayed;<br>\
syn. رَمَّ. (S and K &amp;c. in art. رم.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And of a<br>\
man&#39;s reputation, meaning (assumed tropical:)  It became worn out<br>\
of regard or notice. (TA in art. دثر.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And<br>\
[hence,] بَلِيَتْ, (M,) or بُلِيَتْ, (K,) She (a camel,<br>\
M, K, or a mare, or beast of the equine kind, M)<br>\
was, or became, a بَلَيِّة; i. e., was tied at her dead<br>\
master&#39;s grave (M, K) without food or water (M)<br>\
until she died (M, K) and wasted away. (M in<br>\
art. بلى.)<br>\

بَلَّوَ see 4, in six places, in the latter half of the<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
3<br>\
لَا أَبَالِيهِ is from البلآء, [inf. n. of بَلَاهُ,] so that<br>\
it signifies [properly] I shall not, or I do not,<br>\
care for him, mind him, heed him, or regard him,<br>\
so as to share with him my trial and his trial:<br>\
(Ham p. 94:) [and hence,] one says thus, (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) or مَا أَبَالِيهِ, (M, K,) and لَا أَبَالِىبِهِ,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) or مَا أُبَالِى بِهِ, (MF, TA,) but the<br>\
verb is more chastely made trans. without the<br>\
preposition بِ, (A, TA,) inf. n. مُبَالَاةٌ (M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K) and بِلَآءٌ (M, K, TA [in the CK, erroneously, بَلاء]) and بَالَةٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
said by some to be a quasi-inf. n. and by others<br>\
to be an inf. n., (MF, TA,) [in the T it is said to<br>\
be a subst., from المُبَالَاةُ,] originally بَالِيَةٌ, like عَافِيَةٌ<br>\
from عَافَاهُ, (T, S, Mgh, Msb,) and بَالٌ, [which is<br>\
more strange,] (M, K,) meaning [merely] I shall<br>\
not, or I do not, care for, mind, heed, or regard,<br>\
him, or it; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) I shall not be,<br>\
or I am not, disquieted by him, or it: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) or, as some say, لَا أُبَالِيهِ is formed by<br>\
transposition from لَا أُبَاوِلُهُ, from البَالُ, i. e. I will<br>\
not, or I do not, cause him, or it, to move, or<br>\
occur to, my mind; nor give, or pay, any attention to him, or it: (Z, TA: [and the like is said<br>\
in the T:]) or the proper [or literal] meaning is,<br>\
I will not, or I do not, contend with him for<br>\
superiority in goodness, or excellence, by reason<br>\
of my little care, or regard, for him: (Mgh:)<br>\
or it was employed to denote the contending with<br>\
another for superiority in glory, or excellence, as<br>\
will be shown by the citation of a verse in the<br>\
latter portion of this paragraph; and then, in<br>\
consequence of frequency of usage, came to denote<br>\
contempt, or mean estimation: (Ham p. 31:) or<br>\
its original meaning is, I will not, or I do not,<br>\
strive with him to be first; neglecting him, or<br>\
leaving him to himself; from تَبَالَى القَوْمُ as explained below; see 6. (Msb.) It is said in a<br>\
trad., لَا يُبَالِيهِمُ اللّٰهُ بَالَةً, or, accord. to one reading,<br>\
لَا يُبَالِى بِهِمْ بَالَةً, meaning God will not hold them<br>\
to be of any value or weight. (TA.) And in<br>\
another, هٰؤُلآءِ فِى الجَنَّةِ وَلَا أُبَالِى وَهٰؤُلَآءِ فِى النَّارِ<br>\
وَلَا أُبَالِى, said to mean [These will be in Paradise,<br>\
and] I shall not disapprove; [and these will be<br>\
in the fire of Hell,] and I shall not disapprove.<br>\
(Az, TA.) And one says, لَا أُبَالِى مَا صَنَعْتَ [I<br>\
shall not, or I do not, care for what thou didst,<br>\
or hast done]. (IDrd, TA.) And مَا أُبَالِى أَقُمْتَ<br>\
أَمْ قَعَدْتَ [I care not whether thou stand or sit]:<br>\
and مَا أُبَالِى بِقِيَامِكَ وَعَدَمِهِ [I care not for thy<br>\
standing and thy not doing so]. (Mughnee in<br>\
art. ا.) And مَا بَالَيْتُ بِهِ (AZ, Msb, TA) I did<br>\
not care for, mind, or regard, him, or it. (TA.)<br>\
And بَالَى بِالشَّىْءِ [He cared for the thing; or] he<br>\
was disquieted by the thing. (T.) The verb is<br>\
sometimes thus used, in an affirmative manner;<br>\
(Ham p. 94; [and the like is said in the TA;])<br>\
though some say that it is not; (Msb;) but it is<br>\
not unless it occurs with a negative in the former<br>\
part of the sentence or in the latter part thereof;<br>\
as when one says, مَا بَالَى بِكَ صَدِيقُكَ وَلٰكِنْ بَالَى<br>\
عَبْدُكَ [Thy friend cared not for thee, but thy<br>\
slave cared]; and as in the saying of Zuheyr,<br>\
لَقَدْ بَالَيْتُ مَظْعَنَ أُمِّ أَوْفَى<br>\
وَلٰكِنْ أُمُّ أَوْفَى لَا تُبَالِى<br>\
[Verily I cared for the departure of Umm-Owfà,<br>\
but Umm-Owfà cares not]. (Ham p. 94.) One<br>\
says also, لَمْ أُبَالِ and لَمْ أُبَلْ [I did not care,<br>\
&amp;c.]: (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K: [but in the CK<br>\
the latter of these is omitted:]) in the latter the ا<br>\
[of prolongation] is suppressed for the purpose of<br>\
alleviating the utterance, like as ى is suppressed<br>\
in the inf. n. [or quasi-inf. n.] بَالَةٌ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) originally بَالِيَةٌ, (S, Msb,) and in لَا أَدْرِ:<br>\
(S:) or the ا is suppressed in this case to avoid<br>\
the concurrence of two quiescent letters; (Kh,<br>\
Sb, M, IB;) not for the purpose of alleviating<br>\
the utterance; (IB, TA;) for this is done because<br>\
the ل is made quiescent. (Kh, Sb, M.) And,<br>\
accord. to Kh, (Sb, M,) some of the Arabs say,<br>\
لَمْ أُبَلِهِ [I did not care for him, or it], (Sb, M,)<br>\
or لَمْ أُبَلِ, [in the CK, erroneously, لم اَبْلِ,] with<br>\
kesr to the ل; (K, TA;) [for لم أُبَالِهِ, or لم أُبَالِ;]<br>\
only suppressing the ا, as they do in عُلَبِطٌ [for<br>\
عُلَابِطٌ]. (Sb, S, M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  IAar says that بَالَى,<br>\
inf. n. مُبَالَاةٌ, is like ↓ أَبْلَى meaning He exerted<br>\
himself in a description of a war, or battle, or of<br>\
generous conduct; as when one says, أَبْلَى ذٰلِكَ<br>\
اليَوْمَ بَلَآءً حَسَنًا [He exerted himself well, that<br>\
day, in a description of war, &amp;c.]: and he cites<br>\
the following verse [to which reference has been<br>\
made above]:<br>\
وَأَنْتَ قَدْمَتَّ مِنَ الهُزَالِ<br>\
[What hath happened to me that I see thee standing exerting thyself in a description of generous<br>\
qualities, when thou hast become like one dead by<br>\
reason of leanness?]: he says that he [the poet]<br>\
heard him [whom he thus addresses] saying, “We<br>\
have eaten and we have drunk [with guests], and<br>\
we have done [such and such things]; ” enumerating, or recounting, generous qualities or actions,<br>\
and lying in doing so: (T, TA:) in another place<br>\
he says that تُبَالِى means looking to see which of<br>\
them [or of thee and others] is best in بال [i. e.<br>\
state, or condition], while thou art dying: (TA:)<br>\
he says, also, that بَالَاهُ, inf. n. مُبَالَاةٌ, signifies he<br>\
contended with him for superiority in glory, or<br>\
excellence; (T, TA; *) and [it is said that] تبالى<br>\
in the verse here cited means thus contending;<br>\
syn. تُفَاخِرُ: (Ham p. 31:) and accord. to IAar,<br>\
بَالَاهُ also signifies he contended with him in contradiction. (T, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
ابلاهُ, inf. n. إِبْلَآءٌ: see 1, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] ابلاهُ اللّٰهُ إِبْلَآءً حَسَنًا, (T,) or بَلَآءَ حَسَنًا,<br>\
(S,) God did to him a good deed. (T.) [And<br>\
hence,] it is said in the Kur [viii. 17], وَلِيُبْلِىَ<br>\
المُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْهُ بَلَآءً حَسَنُا (TA) And that He might<br>\
confer upon the believers a great benefit, or favour,<br>\
or blessing: (Bd:) or a good gift; meaning spoil.<br>\
(Jel.) And أَبْلَيْتُهُ مَعْرُوفًا [I conferred upon him<br>\
a favour, or benefit]. (S.) Zuheyr says,<br>\
جَزَى اللّٰهُ بِا لإِحْسَانِ مَا فَعَلَا بِكُمْ<br>\
وَأَبْلَاهُمَا خَيْرَ البَلَآءِ الَّذِى يَبْلُو<br>\
(T, * S,) meaning, الذى يَبْلُو بِهِ عِبَادَهُ, (T,) or<br>\
الذى يَخْتَبِرُ بِهِ عِبَادَ, (S,) i. e. [May God recompense with beneficence what they two have done to<br>\
you,] and do to them two the best of the deeds<br>\
wherewith He tries [the thankfulness of] his<br>\
servants. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ابلاهُ also signifies He made<br>\
him to swear; [as though he tried his veracity by<br>\
so doing;] (M, K;) or so ابلاهُ يَمِينًا. (TA.)<br>\
[See also 8.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And He swore to him: (M, K:)<br>\
or this, (TA,) or ابلاهُ يَمِينًا, [as above,] (T, S,)<br>\
he swore [or swore an oath] to him, and thereby<br>\
soothed, or placated, his mind. (T, S, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And hence, (TA,) He informed him, acquainted<br>\
him, or told him. (IAar, M, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [And<br>\
hence, He manifested it; revealed it; made it<br>\
manifest, apparent, evident, clear, or plain;<br>\
whence a phrase in a verse cited voce مُضْمَرٌ;<br>\
and the phrase] مَا لَمْ يُبْلِ العُذْرَ, i. e. As long as<br>\
he does not manifest, show, or make apparent, the<br>\
excuse: but the verb [in this sense] is originally<br>\
doubly trans.: one says, أَبْلَيْتُ فُلَانًا عُذْرًا, meaning<br>\
I manifested to such a one an excuse so that I<br>\
was not to be blamed after it; properly signifying<br>\
I made such a one to be acquainted with my<br>\
excuse, and to know the manner thereof; (Mgh;)<br>\
and thus it is explained in the A: (TA: [in like<br>\
manner, also, it is explained in the T:]) [or]<br>\
ابلاهُ عُذْرًا signifies He gave him an excuse which<br>\
he accepted: (M, K:) and in like manner, ابلاهُ<br>\
جُهْدَهُ [He gave him his endeavour, or energy, in<br>\
an acceptable manner]; and نَائِلَهُ [his gift]. (M.)<br>\
Hence, ابلى عُذْرَهُ signifies also He strove, laboured,<br>\
or exerted himself, [and thus manifested his excuse,]<br>\
in work. (Mgh.) And hence, ابلى فِى الحَرْبِ<br>\
He manifested, or showed, his might, valour, or<br>\
prowess, in war, or fight, [and he strove, laboured,<br>\
or exerted himself, therein, (عُذْرَهُ being understood,)] so that men proved him and knew him.<br>\
(Mgh.) See also 3, where another explanation of<br>\
ابلى is given, in the latter portion of the paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  ابلى الثَّوْبَ [He wore out the garment;]<br>\
trans. of بَلِىَ; (T, S, M, K;) as also ↓ بَلَّاهُ; (M,<br>\
K;) belonging to the present art. and to art. بلى.<br>\
(M.) One says to the مُجِدّ [i. e. him who makes,<br>\
or puts on, a new garment], أَبْلِ وَ يُخْلِفُ اللّٰهُ<br>\
[Wear out thy garment, and God will replace it<br>\
with another; or, may God replace &amp;c.]. (S.)<br>\
And أَبْلِ وَ أَجِدَّ وَاحْمِدَ الكَاسِى Wear out, and<br>\
make new, [or put on new,] and praise the<br>\
Clother [meaning God]. (S in art. جد.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] السَّفَرُ ↓ بَلَّاهُ [Journeying, or travel, wore<br>\
him, or wasted him]; namely, a man; (M, K;<br>\
but in the copies of the latter, ↓ بَلَاهُ [which I think<br>\
an evident mistranscription];) as also عَلَيْهِ ↓ بلّى;<br>\
and ابلاهُ: (M:) and so الهَمُّ [anxiety], (M, K,)<br>\
and the like, (M,) and التَّجَارِبُ [tryings, or trying<br>\
events]: (K:) and ابلاها السَّفَرُ (T, S) or ↓ بلّاها<br>\
(thus in a copy of the S) [journeying, or travel,<br>\
wore her, or wasted her]; namely, a she-camel.<br>\
(T, S.) El-&#39;Ajjáj says,<br>\
وَالمَرْءُ يُبْلِيهِ بَلَآءَ السِّرْبَالْ<br>\
كَرُّاللَّيالِى وَاخْتِلَافُ الأَحْوَالُ<br>\
[And man, the returning of the nights time after<br>\
time, and the alternation of states of being, wear<br>\
him out as the wearing out of the shirt]: (S, M: *)<br>\
he means, إِبْلَآءَ السِرْبَال, or فَبَلِىَ بَلَآءَ السِّرْبَال. (M.)<br>\
And Ibn-Ahmar says,<br>\
لَبِسْتُ أَبِى حَتَّى تَمَلَّيْتُ عُمْرَهُ<br>\
وَبَلَّيْتُ أَعْمَامِى وَ بَلَّيْتُ خَالِيَا<br>\
he means I lived the period that my father lived<br>\
[so that I had long enjoyment of his life, and I<br>\
outwore my paternal uncles, and I outwore my<br>\
maternal uncle]: or, as some say, I lived with my<br>\
father for the length of his life &amp;c. (M, TA. *<br>\
[In the latter, ↓ تَبَلَّيْتُ is put in the place of تَمَلَّيْتُ;<br>\
and hence it is there said that تَبَلَّاهُ is like بَلَّاهُ:<br>\
but I think that تبلّيت is a mistranscription.]) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
أَبْلَيْتُ and ↓ بَلَّيْتُ also signify I bound the foreshank of a she-camel to her arm at the grave of<br>\
her [dead] master, and left her without food or<br>\
water until she died; or I dug for her a pit, and<br>\
left her in it until she died. (S, TA. [See بَلِيَّةٌ,<br>\
and مُبَلًّى.])<br>\
5<br>\
تَبَلَّوَ see 4, near the end of the paragraph.<br>\
6<br>\
التَّبَالِى [inf. n. of تَبَالَى]: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  تبالى القَوْمُ<br>\
The people, or company of men, vied, or strove,<br>\
one with another, in hastening to a little water,<br>\
and drew from it. (Msb.)<br>\
8<br>\
ابتلاهُ: see 1, in three places. [Hence, اُبْتِلِىَ<br>\
بِكَذَا (vulg. اِبْتَلَى) He was tried, proved, or tested,<br>\
by, or with, such a thing; generally meaning he<br>\
was afflicted thereby, or therewith; as, for instance,<br>\
by, or with, a disease.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He asked, or<br>\
sought, or desired, of him information, or news,<br>\
or tidings. (M, K.) And ابتلى signifies also He<br>\
conjured, or adjured, and asked if any had knowledge; syn. اِسْتَحْلَفَ and اِسْتَعْرَفَ [explained by<br>\
what here follows]. (M, K, TA. [In the CK,<br>\
both the verb and the explanation are here<br>\
wrong: the former is written اُبْلِىَ; and the latter,<br>\
اسْتُحْلِفَ و اسْتُعْرِفَ.]) A poet says,<br>\
تَبَغَّى أَبَاهَا فِى الرِّفَاقِ وَ تَبْتَلِى<br>\
وَ أَوْدَي بِهِ فِى لُجَّةِ البَحْرِ تَمْسَحُ<br>\
[She seeks for her father among the travellingcompanions, and conjures, or adjures, and asks.<br>\
if any have knowledge, when a crocodile has<br>\
destroyed him in the depth of the great river:<br>\
تَبَغَّى is for تَتَبَغَّى]: he means that she says to<br>\
them, “I conjure you, or adjure you, by God,<br>\
(نَاشَدْتُكُمْ اللّٰهَ,) [tell me,] do ye know any tidings<br>\
of my father? ” (M, TA.) But Aboo-Sa&#39;eed says<br>\
that تتبلى here means tries, proves, or tests; and<br>\
that الاِبْتِلَآءُ signifies the trying, proving, or testing,<br>\
whether by an oath or otherwise. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Also<br>\
He desired it; he sought it.] It is said in a trad.,<br>\
النَّذْرُ مَا ابْتُلِىَ بِهِ وَجْهُ اللّٰهُ, i. e. [The vow that a<br>\
man makes to be binding, or obligatory, on himself<br>\
is that whereby the recompense of God] is desired,<br>\
or sought. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And He chose him, made<br>\
choice of him, or elected him. (Sh and T, from a<br>\
trad.)<br>\

اِبْلَوْلَى It (herbage) became tall, so that the<br>\
camels were able to avail themselves of it. (K.)<br>\
بِلْوُ سَفَرٍ, (T, S, M, A,) with kesr to the ب, (S,)<br>\
and بِلْىُ سَفَرٍ, (S, A,) Worn, or wasted, by journeying, or travel; applied to a she-camel, (T, S,<br>\
M, A,) and in like manner to a man, and to a<br>\
he-camel: (M:) and بِلْىُ أَسْفَارٍ (M, K) and بِلْوُ<br>\
أَسْفَارٍ, (K, TA,) with kesr to the ب in both, (TA,<br>\
[in the CK written with fet-h,]) a man worn, or<br>\
wasted, by journeyings, or travels, and anxiety,<br>\
(M, K, *) and the like, (M,) and tryings, or trying events: (K:) pl. أَبْلَآءٌ. (S, M.) And بِلْوٌ شَرٍّ<br>\
and بِلْىُ شَرٍّ [both written in the CK with fet-h<br>\
to the ب] A man having strength, or power, to<br>\
endure evil; tried, proved, or tested, thereby:<br>\
(M, K:) and in like manner, بِلْوُ خَيْرٍ and بِلْىُ خَيْرٍ<br>\
[tried, &amp;c., by good, or prosperity]. (TA.) And<br>\
إِنَّهُ لِبَلْوٌ مِنْ أَبْلَآءِ المَالِ and بِلْىٌ [both written in<br>\
the CK with fet-h to the ب as before] Verily he<br>\
is one of those who manage, or tend, camels, or<br>\
the like, well. (M, * K, * TA.) The ى in بِلْى, in<br>\
all these instances, is originally و, changed into<br>\
ى because of the kesreh, and the weakness of the<br>\
intervening letter, ل; as is the case in عِلَْيَةٌ: so<br>\
says IJ. (M.)<br>\
بَلَى: see art. بلى.<br>\
بِلْوَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
بِلْيَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
بَلْوَي: see what next follows.<br>\
بَلَآءٌ (T, S, Msb) and ↓ بَلْوَى (T, S, M, Msb,<br>\
K) and ↓ بَلِيَّةٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and ↓ بِلْوَةٌ, (S, M,<br>\
K,) with kesr, (S, K,) and ↓ بِلْيَةٌ, (so in a copy<br>\
of the S, beside the third,) thus in the handwriting<br>\
of Aboo-Zekereeyà, in the place of the third,<br>\
(TA,) substs. (T, M, Msb, K) from بَلَاهُ اللّٰهُ, (T,<br>\
Msb,) or from اِبْتَلَاهُ اللّٰهُ, [which is the same in<br>\
meaning,] (M,) or from بَلَوْتُهُ, (K,) are one [in<br>\
their signification; which is A trial, as meaning<br>\
a probation, or a test; and as meaning particularly<br>\
a trouble or an affliction of any kind by which<br>\
one&#39;s patience or any other grace or virtue is<br>\
tried, proved, or tested]; (S;) and the pl. (S,<br>\
TA) of ↓ بَلِيَّةٌ (TA) is بَلَايَا, of the measure فَعَائِلُ<br>\
changed to فَعَالَى: (S, TA:) [or] بَلَآءٌ is [properly, or originally,] an inf. n., (S, M, K,) and<br>\
signifies the act of trying, proving, or testing, by,<br>\
or with, good, and by, or with, evil: (S, M:) it<br>\
is evil and good: (T, M: *) a trial, or an affliction, (T, K,) which is its original meaning; (T;)<br>\
and a [probationary] benefit, favour, or blessing,<br>\
(T,) or a [probationary] gift; (K;) the former<br>\
of these requiring patience, and the latter being<br>\
the greater of the two [as being commonly the<br>\
more dangerous to the soul]; (TA;) [but the<br>\
latter meaning is generally indicated only by the<br>\
addition of an epithet: thus] بَلَآءٌ حَسَنٌ means a<br>\
great benefit, or favour, or blessing, of God; (Bd<br>\
in viii. 17;) or a good gift of God: (Jel ibid.:)<br>\
بَلَآءٌ also means grief; as though it tried the<br>\
body: (Er-Rághib, K:) and the imposition of a<br>\
difficult, or troublesome, thing; a requirement;<br>\
an exaction; because it is difficult, or distressing,<br>\
to the body; or because it is trying. (K.) بَلَآءِ<br>\
(like قَطَامِ, S, K) is syn. with البَلَآءُ: (S, M, K:)<br>\
occurring in the saying, نَزَلَتْ بَلَآءِ عَلَى الكُفَّارِ<br>\
[Trial, or affliction, befell the unbelievers]: (S,<br>\
M, * K: *) mentioned by El-Ahmar, as heard by<br>\
him from the Arabs. (S.)<br>\
بِلَآءٌ, like كِتَابٌ in form, [is an inf. n. of 3,<br>\
q. v.:<br>\
-A2-  and also signifies] Anxiety respecting<br>\
which one talks to himself, or soliloquizes. (Msb.<br>\
[Compare a meaning of بَلَآءٌ, above.])<br>\
بَلِىٌّ: see the paragraph next following; last<br>\
sentence.<br>\
بَلِيَّةٌ: see بَلَآءٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also A she-camel that has her fore shank bound to her arm<br>\
at the grave of her master, and is left without<br>\
food until she dies: (T:) or a she-camel, (M in<br>\
arts. بلو and بلى, and K,) or a mare, or beast of<br>\
the equine kind, (M in art. بلو,) that is bound at<br>\
the grave of her master, (M, K,) he being dead,<br>\
and is left without food or water (M) until she<br>\
dies (M, K) and wastes away; for they used to<br>\
say that her master would be raised from the<br>\
dead upon her: (M:) or a she-camel which, in<br>\
the Time of Ignorance, had her fore shank bound<br>\
to her arm at the grave of her master, and was<br>\
left without food or water until she died: or for<br>\
which was dug a pit, wherein she was left until<br>\
she died: for they used to assert that men would<br>\
be raised from the dead riding upon the بَلَايَا,<br>\
[pl. of بَلِيَّةٌ in the sense above explained, (T,<br>\
TA,)] or walking if their beasts whereon they<br>\
rode were not bound, with the head turned backwards, at their graves: (S:) or a cow, or she-camel, or sheep, or goat, which, in the Time of<br>\
Ignorance, they used to hamstring, or slaughter,<br>\
at the grave: so in a trad. (TA.) Suh says that<br>\
this custom proves that, in the Time of Ignorance,<br>\
they held the doctrine of the resurrection of the<br>\
body: but they who held it were the fewer<br>\
number. (TA.) It is said that بَلِيَّةٌ is originally<br>\
↓ مُبْلَاةٌ or ↓ مُبَلَّاةٌ. (TA.) Et-Tirimmáh says,<br>\
مَنَازِلُ لَا تَرَى الأَنْصَابَ فِيهَا<br>\
وَلَا حُفَرَ المُبَلَّى لِلْمَنُونِ<br>\
[Places of abode in which thou wilt not see the<br>\
stones, or other things, that have been set up to<br>\
be worshipped, nor the pits of the beast left by the<br>\
grave of the master to die]; meaning places of<br>\
abode of the people of El-Islám, exclusively of<br>\
the pagans. (S.) IAar says that ↓ بَلِىٌّ and بَلِيَّةٌ<br>\
signify Such as is wearied, or jaded, and emaciated, and dying. (TA.)<br>\
بَالٍ [act. part. n. of بَلَاهُ; Trying, proving, or<br>\
testing. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,] Knowing, or being acquainted [with a thing]; as in the phrase, جَعَلْتُهُ<br>\
بَالِيًا بِعُذْرِى I made him to be acquainted with my<br>\
excuse, and to know the manner thereof. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Old, and wearing out [or worn out];<br>\
applied to a garment. (Msb.) ―<br>\

p. 492.)<br>\

riding-camel [which they bind, or place in a pit,<br>\

S. *) You say, قَامَتْ مُبَلِّيَاتُ فُلَانٍ يَنُحْنَ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
[The women that bound, or placed, the بَلِيَّة by the<br>\
grave of such a one stood around it wailing for<br>\
him]. (T, S.)<br>\
