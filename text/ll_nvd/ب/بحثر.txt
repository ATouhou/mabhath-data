بَحْثَرَ, [inf. n. بَحْثَرَةٌ,] He took, drew,<br>\
or pulled, a thing out, or forth; and uncovered<br>\
it, laid it open, or  exposed it; (Abu-l-Jarráh, S,<br>\
K;) as also بَعْثَرَ. (Abu-l-Jarráh, S.) It is said<br>\
in the Kur [c. 9], accord. to one reading, بُعْثِرَ<br>\

[When that which is in the graves is taken forth<br>\
and uncovered; i. e.,] when the dead are raised<br>\
to life; syn. بُعِثَ; and it is not improbable that<br>\
بَحْثَرَ may be composed of بَحَثَ and أَثَرَ [app.<br>\
a mistranscription for أَثَارَ], accord. to the opinion<br>\
of those who hold that quadriliteral and quinqueliteral words are composed of two. (TA.) ―<br>\

He searched, or sought, for, or after, a thing<br>\

but see بَعْثَرَ]. (L, K, and Bd in c. 9.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He<br>\
separated, disunited, scattered, dispersed, or dissipated, (S, K,) a thing. (S.) He scattered, or dispersed, his household goods, or his commodities,<br>\
