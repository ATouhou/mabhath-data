want of thankfulness: or he behaved with the<br>\

his mind upon things agreeable with natural<br>\
desire: syn. of the inf. n. أَشَرٌ, (S, A, L, Msb,<br>\
TA,) and مَرَحٌ; (L, TA;) the former of which<br>\
signifies شِدَّةٌ المَرَحِ, (S, A,) and مُجَاوَزَةُ الحَدِّ فِى<br>\
مَرَحٍ: (A:) he was, or became, stupified, deprived<br>\
of his reason, confounded, or amazed, (S, K, Er-Rághib,) bearing wealth ill, or in an evil manner,<br>\

signification: (TA:) he was, or became, stupified,<br>\
or confounded, and knew not what to prefer nor<br>\
what to postpone: (TA:) he was, or became,<br>\
confounded, perplexed, or amazed, by reason of<br>\
fright: (As, S voce بَحِرَ:) he behaved exorbitantly, or insolently, with wealth, (K, TA,) or<br>\
on the occasion of having wealth: and this, also,<br>\
is said to be the primary signification: (TA:) he<br>\

wealth [in a becoming, or proper, manner]: (K:)<br>\
he behaved proudly: (TA:) he regarded a thing<br>\
with hatred, or dislike, without its deserving to<br>\
be so regarded: he was, or became, brisk, lively,<br>\
or sprightly: (K:) accord. to some, he walked<br>\
with an elegant and a proud and self-conceited<br>\
gait, with an affected inclining of the body from<br>\
side to side. (TA.) It is said in a trad., لَا يَنْظُرُ<br>\
اللّٰهُ يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ مَنْ جَرَّ إِزَارَهُ بَطَرًا [God will not<br>\
look, on the day of resurrection, upon him who<br>\
drags along his wrapper of the lower part of the<br>\
body in exultation and insolence, or pride: meaning one who wears too long a wrapper of the<br>\
lower part of the body]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بَطِرْتَ عَيْشَكَ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Thou exultedst, or exultedst greatly, or excessively, and behavedst insolently and unthankfully,<br>\
or ungratefully, &amp;c., in thy manner of life,] is a<br>\
phrase similar to رَشِدْتَ أَمْرَكَ; (S, TA;) and in<br>\
like manner بَطِرَتْ مَعِيشَتَهَا, in the Kur [xxviii. 58];<br>\
in which the verb is not trans., but the subst. is<br>\
put in the accus. case because of فِى understood<br>\
before it. (Aboo-Is-hák.) ―<br>\
-b3-  لَا أَبْطَرُ الغِنَى (assumed tropical:)  I<br>\
do not, or will not, domineer, or assume superiority, over others when I am rich. (Ham p. 517.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  بَطِرَ النِّعْمَةَ (tropical:)  He held wealth, or the favour, or<br>\

-b6-  It is said in a trad., that pride is بَطَرُ الحَقِّ,<br>\
which means (tropical:)  The considering as false, or vain,<br>\
what God has pronounced to be the truth, or<br>\
our duty; namely, the confession of his unity, and<br>\
the obligation of rendering Him religious service:<br>\
or the being confounded at considering truth, or<br>\
duty, and not seeing it to be true, or incumbent:<br>\
(TA:) or the disdaining the truth, or right, and<br>\
not accepting it or not admitting it. (K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\

بَطِرَ, (K,) inf. n. بَطْرٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) He cut it, or divided it, lengthwise; slit<br>\
it; split it. (S, Msb, K.) Hence the appellation<br>\
بَيْطَارٌ. (S, Msb.)<br>\
4<br>\
ابطرهُ It rendered him such as is termed<br>\
بَطِر; it (wealth) caused him to exult, or to exult<br>\
greatly, or excessively, and to behave insolently<br>\
and unthankfully, or ungratefully: &amp;c.: [see<br>\
بَطِرَ:] (S, A:) it stupified him, deprived him<br>\
of his reason, confounded him, or amazed him.<br>\
(S, K.) You say, مَا أَمْطَرَتْ حَتَّى أَبْطَرَتْ It (the<br>\

or to exult greatly, &amp;c. (A.) ―<br>\

-b3-  ابطرهُ حِلْمَهُ (tropical:)  It<br>\
stupified, confounded, or amazed, him, so as to<br>\
turn him from his clemency, moderation, or<br>\
gravity. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  ابطرهُ ذَرْعَهُ (tropical:)  He imposed upon<br>\
him more than he was able to do; (S;) what<br>\
was above his power: (K:) ذرعه is here a substitute for its antecedent to indicate an implication<br>\
therein: (A:) you say this when a slow-paced<br>\
camel has endeavoured in vain to keep pace with<br>\
another camel; and when any man has imposed<br>\
upon another a difficulty beyond his power: (TA:)<br>\
or the meaning is, he cut off his means of subsistence, and wasted his body: (IAar, K:) ذرع<br>\
signifying the “ body. ” (IAar.)<br>\

وأَشِرَتٌ [because of her insolent behaviour]: and<br>\
says that, accord. to Aboo-Kheyreh, it is امراة<br>\
بِظْرِيرٌ; her tongue being likened to the بَظْر: but<br>\

opinion, and more correct. (T in art. بظر.)<br>\
