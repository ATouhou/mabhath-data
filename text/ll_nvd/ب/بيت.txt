بَاتَ, (T, S M, &amp;c.,) aor. يَبِيتُ and يَبَاتُ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) inf. n. بَيْتُوتَةٌ (Lth, T, S A, Msb, K) and<br>\
مَبِيتٌ (Msb, K) and مَبَاتٌ (Msb) and بَيْتٌ and<br>\
بَيَاتٌ, (K,) has two meanings: in that which more<br>\
commonly obtains, the action is restricted to the<br>\
night: (Msb:) it is by night, or in night; not<br>\
in sleep: (M:) you say, بَاتَ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا, meaning<br>\
He did such a thing by night, or at night: (S,<br>\
Msb, K:) [or he was in the night, or at night, or<br>\
during the night, doing such a thing: and he<br>\
passed, or spent, the night, or a night, or a part<br>\
thereof, or, as will be seen below, he entered upon<br>\
the night, doing such a thing:] like as one says,<br>\
ظَلَّ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا as meaning “ he did such a thing<br>\
by day,” or “ at day-time: ” (S, Msb;*) IKoot<br>\
and Es-Sarakustee and IKtt say that it has this<br>\
meaning, and not “ he slept: ” (Msb:) [F adds,]<br>\
وَ لَيْسَ مِنَ النَّوْمِ, (K,) which is said to mean, “and<br>\
the action is not one of sleep; ” so that when one<br>\
sleeps by night, or at night, it is not correct to<br>\
say, بَاتَ يَنَامُ: or, accord. to some, “its meaning<br>\
is not that of sleeping; ” so that one may say,<br>\
بَاتَ زَيْدٌ نَائِمًا [Zeyd was in the night, &amp;c., or<br>\
passed, or spent, the night, &amp;c., sleeping]: (MF:)<br>\
[Fei says,] it is only when one remains awake in<br>\
the night: and hence the saying in the Kur<br>\
[xxv. 65], وَالَّذِينَ يَبِيتُونَ لِرَّبِهِمْ سُجَّدًا وَقِيامًا [And<br>\
those who pass the night prostrating themselves to<br>\
their Lord and standing up in prayer]: (Msb:)<br>\
Fr says that بَاتَ الرَّجُلُ means The man remained<br>\
awake all the night, engaged in acts of obedience or<br>\
of disobedience: (T, Msb:) [or it means the man<br>\
entered upon the night; or he was in the night, or at<br>\
night, or during the night, in any state, or engaged<br>\
in any action; for] Zj says, (M,) بَاتَ is said of<br>\
any one whom the night has overtaken, (M, K, *)<br>\
whether he have slept or not slept: (M:) and<br>\
Lth says, البَيْتُوتَةُ signifies the entering upon the<br>\
night: one says, بِتُّ أَصْنَعُ كَذَا وَ كَذَا [I entered<br>\
upon the night doing such and such things]: and<br>\
he adds, (T,) he who says بَاتَ as meaning he<br>\
slept commits an error; for you say, بِتُّ أُرَاعِى<br>\
النُّجُومَ [I entered upon, or passed, the night]<br>\
looking at the stars: and how can he be sleeping<br>\
who is looking at them? (T, Msb:) but Mullà<br>\
&#39;Abd-El-Hakeem, in his Commentaries on the<br>\
Mutowwal, says that بَاتَ sometimes means he<br>\
remained, continued, stayed, or dwelt, and he<br>\
alighted and abode, by night, or at night, whether<br>\
he slept or not: (MF:) and Ibn-Keysán says<br>\
that it may be used in the same manner as نَامَ [he<br>\
slept]; and also, [as will be explained below,] in<br>\
the same manner as كَانَ. (TA.) You say, بَاتَ<br>\
بَيْتُوتَةً صَالِحَةً (T) or طَيِّبَةً (A) [He passed, or<br>\
entered upon, the night, or a night, in a good<br>\
manner]. And بِتُّ القَوْمَ and بِتُّ بِهِمْ and بِتُّ<br>\
عِنْدَهُمْ [I passed, or entered upon, the night, or a<br>\
night, with, or at the abode of, the people, or company of men: the last of these phrases is the most<br>\
common]. (A &#39;Obeyd, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Secondly, it is<br>\
used in the sense of صَارَ [He became]; (Msb;)<br>\
or in the same manner as كَانَ [he was]. (Ibn-Keysán, TA.) One says, بَاتَ بِمَوْضِعِ كَذَا He<br>\
became [or was] in such a place; whether in<br>\
night-time or in day-time. (Msb.) And hence<br>\
the saying of the lawyers, بَاتَ عِنْدَ امْرَأَتِهِ لَيْلَةً He<br>\
became [or was] with his wife one night; [which<br>\
is the same as he passed a night &amp;c.; though this,<br>\
it will be observed, is not in this instance the<br>\
signification of the verb alone;] whether sleeping<br>\
or not. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Thus it is used both as a<br>\
“ complete,” i. e. an attributive, verb, and also as<br>\
an “ incomplete,” i. e. a non-attributive, verb.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
بَاتَ, aor. يَبِيتُ, (T, A,) inf. n. بَيْتٌ, (T, M, K,)<br>\
also signifies (tropical:)  He married, or took a wife: (T,<br>\
A:) [see بَيْتٌ below:] or (assumed tropical:)  he gave in marriage;<br>\
syn. of the inf. n. تَزْوِيجٌ. (Kr, M, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
بيّت البَيْتَ He constructed, or built, the بَيْت<br>\
[i. e. tent, or house, &amp;c.]. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  بيّت الأَمْرِ,<br>\
[inf. n. as below,] He did, or performed, the<br>\
thing, or affair, by night, or at night: (M:) and<br>\
he thought, or meditated, upon it, considering its<br>\
end, or issue, or result, (Zj, T, S, M, A, Msb, K,)<br>\
or entered into it, (Zj, T,) by night, or at night.<br>\
(Zj, T, S, M, &amp;c.) And one says, بُيِّتَ بِلَيْلٍ, (T,<br>\
A,) meaning the same as دُبِّرَ بِلَيْلِ [It was thought,<br>\
or meditated, upon, &amp;c., by night, or at night]:<br>\
(T:) [for] بُيِّتَ الشَّىْءُ also signifies [simply] the<br>\
thing was thought upon, and considered as to its<br>\
end, issue, or result; syn. قُدِّرَ. (S.) Accord. to<br>\
El-Marzookee, they say of a thing that is not<br>\
done deliberately, and with good consideration of<br>\
its issue or result, هٰذَا أَمْرٌ قُدِّرَ بِلَيْلٍ; [in the text<br>\
from which this is taken, without the syll. signs;]<br>\
and hence the saying in the Kur [iv. 83], بَيَّتَ<br>\
طَائِفَةٌ مِنْهُمْ غَيْرِ الَّذِى تَقُولُ [A part of them meditateth by night upon doing otherwise than that<br>\
which thou sayest; as is indicated in the M,<br>\
where this is cited; and in like manner, يُبَيِّتُونَ,<br>\
in the continuation of the same passage of the<br>\
Kur, is explained in the T as meaning يُدَبِّرُونَ,<br>\
and يُقَدِّرُونَ, (i. e. مِنَ السُّوْءِ,) لَيْلًا]: but Aboo-Hilál says that a thing is meditated upon in the<br>\
night in order that one may apply himself to it<br>\
with strong purpose, and not be diverted by other<br>\
things, so that it may be done with more firmness;<br>\
and he cites the same passage of the Kur. (Ham<br>\
p. 130.) And hence, in the Kur [iv. 108], إِذْ<br>\
يُبَيِّتُونَ مَا لَا يَرْضَى مِنَ القَوْلِ When they meditate,<br>\
&amp;c., (S, M, Bd, Jel,) by night, (S, M,) [what He<br>\
will not approve, of speech,] and prepare it [in<br>\
their minds] (يُزَوِّرُونَهُ [see art. زور]). (Bd.) It<br>\
is said in a trad., لَا صِيَامَ لِمَنْ لَمْ يُبَيِّتِ الصِّيَامَ<br>\
There is no fasting to him [meaning his fasting is<br>\
null] who does not purpose it from the night.<br>\
(TA. [See another reading, voce بَتَّ.]) And<br>\
you say, بَيَّتَ النِّيَّةَ He decided upon the purpose,<br>\
or intention, by night, or in night-time. (Msb.)<br>\
And بَيَّتَ رَأْيَهُ He thought upon his opinion, and<br>\
concealed it, or conceived it, in his mind. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  بَيَّتَهُمْ, (inf. n. تَبْيِيتٌ, (Msb, TA,) He came<br>\
upon them, (Mgh, but the verb is there pl.,) or<br>\
made a sudden attack upon them, and engaged<br>\
with them in conflict, (Msb,) or made a great<br>\
slaughter among them, or engaged with them in<br>\
vehement conflict, (S, M, K,) namely, the enemy,<br>\
(S, Mgh, K,) or a people, (M,) by night: (S,<br>\
M, Mgh, Msb, K:) he came upon them (the sons<br>\
of such a one) in the night, and made a sudden<br>\
attack upon them, while they were heedless: (T:)<br>\
he attacked them (the people of a house or place<br>\
of abode) by night: he went to them (the enemy)<br>\
in the night, without their knowledge, and took<br>\
them by surprise. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  كَانَ لَا يُبَيِّتُ مَا لاًا وَلَا<br>\
يُقَيِّلُهُ He used not to retain property until night,<br>\
nor to retain it until noon, when it came to him;<br>\
but used to hasten the dividing of it. (TA, from<br>\
a trad.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 4.<br>\
-A3-  بيّت النَّخْلَ He trimmed,<br>\
or pruned, the palm-trees, by cutting off the stumps<br>\
of the branches, or by cutting off the straggling<br>\
branches, not in the best part thereof. (K.)<br>\
-A4-<br>\
See also 5.<br>\
4<br>\
اباتهُ, inf. n. إِبَاتَةٌ, He (God) made him, or<br>\
caused him, to pass, or spend, the night, [or a<br>\
part thereof,] or to enter upon the night. (T, M,<br>\
K.) You say, أَبَاتَكَ اللّٰهُ حَسَنَةً [May God make<br>\
thee to pass, or enter upon, the night with happiness], (S,) and إِبَاتَةً حَسَنَةً [in a good manner of<br>\
doing so]. (T, A.) And [in like manner,] ↓ بَيَّتَكَ<br>\
اللّٰهُ فِى عَافِيَةٍ [May God make thee to pass, or<br>\
enter upon, the night in health and safety]. (A.)<br>\
And أَبَاتَهُ اللّٰهُ أَحْسَنَ بِيتَةٍ God made him to pass,<br>\
or enter upon, the night in the best manner of<br>\
doing so. (M, K. *)<br>\
5<br>\
تبيّتهُ عَنْ حَاجَتِهِ [so in the TA and in a MS.<br>\
copy of the K: in the CK ↓ بَيَّتَهُ:] He withheld,<br>\
or debarred, him from the thing that he wanted.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَبْيَتَ [استبات seems to signify He asked for, or<br>\
required, بِيت, or بِيتَة i. e. food: (see مُسْتَبِيتٌ:)<br>\
and also to have the contr. signification; i. e. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
He possessed food: for you say,] لَا يَسْتَبِيتُ لَيْلَةً<br>\
He possesses not a night&#39;s food. (T, K.) And<br>\
لَا يَسْتَبِيتُ He has not food. (A.)<br>\
بَيْتٌ [signifies A tent; properly, having more<br>\
than one pole; but often applied without this<br>\
restriction: and also a house; a chamber; an<br>\
apartment; a closet; and the like]: a بَيْت is [a<br>\
tent] of [goats&#39;] hair (شَعَر), (M, A, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K,) or of wool: (Mgh:) a بيت of hair [i. e.<br>\
hair-cloth] is that kind [of tent] which has more<br>\
than one pole: the word is masc.: and applies to<br>\
small and large: (M:) tents of goats&#39; hair are<br>\
peculiar to people of cold countries and of fertile<br>\
regions, where the goats have abundant hair; for<br>\
the goats of the Arabs of the desert have short<br>\
hair, not long enough to be spun: (T in art.<br>\
بنى:) a خِبَآء is a small بيت of wool or of hair:<br>\
a بيت is what is larger than a خبآء: next is the<br>\
مِظَلَّة, which is larger than the بيت; but the<br>\
term بيت is also applied to a مظلّة when it is<br>\
large and مُرَوَّق [i. e. furnished with a رِوَاق,<br>\
q. v.]: (T:) Ibn-El-Kelbee says that the Arabs<br>\
have six kinds of بيت; namely, a قُبَّة, which is<br>\
of skins, or tanned hides; a مِظَلَّة, of hair; a<br>\
خِبَآء, of wool; a بِجَاد, of soft hair (وَبَر); a خَيْمَة,<br>\
of trees; an أُقْنَة, of stone; and a سَوْط, of hair;<br>\
or this is the smallest of them: El-Baghdádee<br>\
says that the خباء is a بيت made of soft hair<br>\
(وَبَر), or of wool, or of hair [commonly so called]<br>\
(شَعَر), upon two poles, or three; and that a<br>\
بيت is [a tent] upon six poles, or more, to the<br>\
number of nine: in the Towsheeh it is said that<br>\
the term خباء is applied to a بيت of any kind:<br>\
(TA:) a بيت is also [a structure] of clay, or<br>\
tough or cohesive clay or earth; (A, K;) [and<br>\
of baked bricks; and of stone;] the name being<br>\
likewise applied to a structure of a kind other<br>\
than the structures which are called أَخْبِيَة [or<br>\
tents]; (M;) signifying a habitation [of any<br>\
kind; an abode; a dwelling]: (Msb:) a man&#39;s<br>\
house; syn. دَارٌ: (T:) [and particularly a chamber;<br>\
i. e.] a single roofed structure (Mgh, Kull) having<br>\
a place of entrance; مَنْزِلٌ being applied to what<br>\
comprises more than one [such] بيت, and a roofed<br>\
صَحْن [or vacant part, and a kitchen, inhabited<br>\
by a man with his family]; and دَارٌ, that which<br>\
comprises more than one [such] بيت and more<br>\
than one [such] مَنْزِل and a [court, or] صَحْن<br>\
without a roof: (Kull:) the pl. is بُيُوتٌ, (S, M,<br>\
K, &amp;c.,) also pronounced بِيُوتٌ, (TA,) and أَبْيَاتٌ,<br>\
(S, M, K,) the latter a pl. of pauc.; (TA;) and<br>\
pl. pl. بُيُوتَاتٌ (M, Mgh, K) and أَبَايِيتُ (Sb, S,<br>\
M, K) and أَبْيَاوَاتٌ, (Fr, M, K,) which last is<br>\
extr.: (M:) the dim. is ↓ بُيَيْتٌ, also pronounced<br>\
↓ بِيَيْتٌ; (S, K;) and the vulgar say, بُوَيْتٌ, (S,)<br>\
which is not allowable. (K.) You say, هُوَ جَارِى<br>\
بَيْتَ بَيْتَ, (T, S, M,) He is my neighbour [tent<br>\
to tent, or house to house, i. e.,] by contiguity [of<br>\
our habitations]: بيت بيت being made indecl.<br>\
with fet-h for the termination because they are<br>\
two nouns made one: (S:) Sb says that some of<br>\
the Arabs make them [thus] indecl., like خَمْسَةَ<br>\
عَشَرَ, and some make the former a prefixed noun<br>\
governing the latter in the gen. case, [saying<br>\
بَيْتَ بَيْتٍ,] except when used as a denotative of<br>\
state: (M:) one says also, بَيْتًا لِبَيْتٍ, and بَيْتٌ<br>\
لِبَيْتٍ; (Fr, T;) which last, or بَيْتٌ إِلَى بَيْتٍ, is<br>\
the original form. (Har p. 353.) بَنَى فُلَانٌ عَلَى<br>\
امْرَأَتِهِ [lit. Such a one constructed a tent over<br>\
his wife,] means such a one had his wife conducted<br>\
to him on the occasion of his marriage, and brought<br>\
her, or had her brought, into a pitched tent, having<br>\
conveyed thither the utensils and furniture and<br>\
other things that they required. (T.) And أَهْلُ<br>\
بَيْتُ النَّبِىِّ [The people of the house of the Prophet,]<br>\
means the Prophet&#39;s wives and his daughter and<br>\
&#39;Alee: and so أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ [i. e. يَخُصُّ أَهْلَ البَيْتِ<br>\
He means particularly, or peculiarly, the people<br>\
of the house], in the Kur xxxiii. 33: بَنُو and مَعْشَر<br>\
and أَهْل and آل, as prefixed nouns, being, as Sb<br>\
says, the nouns most frequently occurring in the<br>\
accus. case [for the reason indicated above, or,<br>\
as the Arabian grammarians express it,] عَلَى<br>\
الاِخْتِصَاصِ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It also signifies A [pavilion, palace, or mansion, such as is called] قَصْر:<br>\
(T, K:) whence the saying of Gabriel, بَشِّرْ خَدِيجَةَ<br>\
بِبَيْتٍ مِنْ قَصَبٍ, i. e. [Rejoice thou Khadeejeh by<br>\
the announcement of] a pavilion (قصر) of hollow<br>\
pearls, (T, TA,) or of emerald. (TA. [See also art.<br>\
قصب.]) بُيُوتًا غَيْرَ مَسْكُونَةٍ [Uninhabited houses],<br>\
in the Kur xxiv. 29, means buildings for the<br>\
reception of travellers, or for merchants and<br>\
their goods, and the shops of the merchants and<br>\
places in which things are sold, the entering of<br>\
which is allowed by their owners: or ruins which<br>\
a man enters for the purpose of easing nature.<br>\
(M.) And the بُيُوت which God has permitted<br>\
to be raised, mentioned in the same chapter,<br>\
verse 36, are Mosques, or places of worship: or,<br>\
accord. to El-Hasan, Jerusalem (بَيْتُ المَقْدِسِ);<br>\
the pl. being applied to it as a mark of honour.<br>\
(Zj, M.) البَيْتُ [The House] applies particularly<br>\
to (tropical:)  the Kaabeh [of Mekkeh]; (K;) as also بَيْتُ اللّٰهِ<br>\
[the House of God]; (AAF, M;) and البَيْتُ<br>\
الحَرَامُ [the Sacred House]; (T;) and البَيْتُ<br>\
العَتِيقُ [the Ancient House]; (S and K &amp;c. in<br>\
art. عتق;) and accord. to some, البَيْتُ المَعْمُورُ,<br>\
q. v. (Bd in lii. 4.) [بَيْتُ المَالِ signifies The<br>\
treasury of the state. And بَيْتُ المَآءِ is a euphemism for The privy; because water is put there<br>\
for the purpose of ablution: also called بَيْتُ الفَرَاغِ,<br>\
&amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The ark of Noah: so in the Kur<br>\
lxxi. last verse. (T.) ―<br>\
-b4-  (tropical:)  A grave; (M, IAth, K;)<br>\
app. by way of comparison. (M.) So in a trad.<br>\
of Aboo-Dharr: كَيْفَ تَصْنَعُ إِذَا مَاتَ النَّاسُ حَتَّى<br>\
يَكُونُ البَيْتُ بِالوَصِيفِ, meaning How will thou do<br>\
when men shall die so that the grave shall be sold<br>\
for the [servant-] boy? (IAth.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  The habitation of the سُرْفَة, which it constructs in a beautiful<br>\
manner, (A&#39;Obeyd, M,) of fragments of sticks;<br>\
(Yaakoob, M;) and of the صَيْدَنَانِىّ, which it<br>\
makes in the interior of the earth, and covers over:<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, M:) and (assumed tropical:)  the burrow, or hole, of the<br>\
ضَبّ &amp;c.: and (assumed tropical:)  the web of the spider: all, app.,<br>\
as being likened to the بَيْت of a man. (M.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
(tropical:)  A man&#39;s household. (S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  (tropical:)  The wife<br>\
(As, IAar, T, M, A) of a man. (M, A.) So in<br>\
the saying,<br>\
أَكِبَرٌ غَيَّرَنِى أمْ بَيْتُ<br>\
[Hath old age altered me, or a wife?]: (As, T:)<br>\
or here it means a household. (S.) ―<br>\
-b8-  The nobility<br>\
of the Arabs; (T, Msb, K; *) as when one says,<br>\
بَيْتُ تَمِيمٍ فِى بَنِى حَنْظَلَةَ [The nobility of Temeem<br>\
is in the sons of Handhaleh]: (T, Msb: *) or the<br>\
family that comprises the nobility of a tribe; as<br>\
آلُ حِصْنٍ of the فَزَارِيُّون, and آلُ الجُدَّيْنِ of the<br>\
شَيْبَانِيُّون, and آلُ عَبْدِ المَدَانِ of the حَارِثِيُّون;<br>\
which three were asserted by Ibn-El-Kelbee to<br>\
be the highest of the families thus called of the<br>\
Arabs: (M:) [see a verse of El-Lahabee cited<br>\
voce أَخْضَرُ:] pl. بُيُوتٌ and بُيُوتَاتٌ, (T, M,) the<br>\
latter being pl. of the former. (T.) You say,<br>\
هُوَ مِنْ أَهْلِ البُيُوتَاتِ He is of the people of nobility:<br>\
and مِنْ بَيْتٍ كَرِيمٍ [of a generous, or noble, house,<br>\
or family]. (A.) [See also بَنَى.] ―<br>\
-b9-  A noble<br>\
person: (M, Mgh, K:) pl. بُيُوتٌ and بُيُوتَاتٌ.<br>\
(Mgh.) You say, فُلَانٌ بَيْتُ قَوْمِهِ Such a one is<br>\
the noble person of his people. (Abu-l-&#39;Omeythil<br>\
El-Aarabee, M.) ―<br>\
-b10-  (tropical:)  The [furniture termed]<br>\
فَرْش, (A, Mgh, K,) or مَتَاع, (TA,) of a tent or<br>\
house, (Mgh, K,) or that is sufficient for a tent<br>\
or house. (A.) You say, تَزَوَّجْتُ فُلَانَةَ عَلَى بَيْتٍ<br>\
(tropical:)  I married, or took as a wife, such a woman for<br>\
[my giving] furniture sufficient for a tent or<br>\
house, (A,) or furniture of a house or tent.<br>\
(Mgh.) [See 1, last sentence.] ―<br>\
-b11-  A بَيْت of<br>\
poetry, (T, S, M, Msb,) or of the poet, (K,) is<br>\
(tropical:)  [A verse; i. e.] what consists of certain known<br>\
divisions [or feet] called أَجْزَآءُ التَّفْعِيلِ; being<br>\
termed بيت metaphorically, because of the conjoining of its component parts, one to another, in<br>\
a particular manner, like as those of a tent are<br>\
conjoined in its construction; (Msb;) because it<br>\
consists of words collected together in a regular<br>\
manner, and so resembles a tent, which is composed of a سَقْف and كِفَآء and رِوَاق and عُمُد:<br>\
(T:) it is derived from the same word signifying<br>\
a خِبَآء [or tent], and applies to the small and the<br>\
great, as the رَجَز and the طَوِيل; and is [said to<br>\
be] thus called because it comprises words like as<br>\
the tent comprises its inhabitants; wherefore its<br>\
component parts are termed أَسْبَاب and أَوْتَاد, as<br>\
being likened to the اسباب and اوتاد of tents:<br>\
(M:) pl. أَبْيَاتٌ and بُيُوتٌ, (M, A, Msb,) the latter<br>\
mentioned by Sb and IJ, (M,) [but rare,] and<br>\
[pl. pl.] أَبَايِيتُ: (A:) Abu-l-Hasan says that if<br>\
the بيت of poetry be likened to the بيت which is<br>\
a tent or other kind of structure, there is no reason<br>\
why it should not have the same pl. forms as the<br>\
latter has. (L.) By the following words of a poet,<br>\
وَبَيْتٍ عَلَى ظَهْرِ المَطِىِّ بَنَيْتُهُ<br>\
بِأَسْمَرَ مَشْقُوقِ الخَيَاشِيمِ يَرْعُفُ<br>\
[Many a بيت upon the back of the camel have I<br>\
constructed with a lawny thing slit in the nose<br>\
and bleeding], is meant, many a بيت of poetry<br>\
have I written with the reed-pen. (S.) [البَيْتَ,<br>\
written after a quotation of a part of a verse of<br>\
poetry, means اِقْرَأِ البَيْتَ Read thou the verse.]<br>\
بَيْتُ القَصِيدَةِ [The chief verse of the poem] is a<br>\
phrase employed when a person composes a poem<br>\
in praise of any one from whom he would obtain<br>\
some object of desire and want, being applied to<br>\
that verse of the poem in which the author&#39;s want<br>\

[hence,] one says, فُلَانٌ أَوَّلُ الجَرِيدَةِ وَبَيْتُ القَصِيدَةِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Such a one is the first of the detachment of<br>\
horsemen, and the chief verse of the poem]. (Har<br>\
