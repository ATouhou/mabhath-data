بَوَارٌ, (Msb,) (tropical:)  It (a thing, Msb, or commodity,<br>\
T, S, A, Mgh) was, or became, unsaleable, or difficult of sale, or in little demand: (T, S, A, Mgh,<br>\

حور.]<br>\
-A2-  بَارَ النَّاقَةَ, (T, S, A, K,) aor. as above,<br>\
(T, S, A,) inf. n. بَوْرٌ, (S,) He brought the she-camel to the stallion to see if she were pregnant<br>\
or not: (T, S, A, K:) for if she is pregnant,<br>\

he smells her. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He (the stallion)<br>\
smelt the she-camel to know if she were pregnant or not; (T, S, M, K;) and so ↓ ابتارها.<br>\

trying, with speaking truth, to elicit what is in<br>\

with an explanation given above]): (S, TA:) or<br>\
↓ ابتيارا, which is without ء, here signifies by<br>\
asserting with truth my having had sexual intercourse with her: (TA:) [for] ابتارها signifies he<br>\
asserted with truth that he had had sexual intercourse with her; and ابتهرها “ he asserted the<br>\
same falsely: ” (A &#39;Obeyd, T:) and the former<br>\
signifies also he had sexual intercourse with her<br>\
(K, TA) by force; he ravished her: (TA:) or<br>\

words belong accord. to Fei, and the same is<br>\
