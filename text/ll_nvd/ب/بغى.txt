بَغَى, (S, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
بَغِىَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
بُغَآءٌ, (S, Mgh, K, &amp;c.,) or this is a simple subst.,<br>\
and the inf. n. is بَغْىٌ, (Msb,) [but, if this be<br>\
correct, the former is generally used for the latter,]<br>\
and بُغًى, (Lh, K,) but the first is better known,<br>\
and is the chaste form, and some say, بِغًى, (TA,)<br>\
and بُغْيَةٌ and بِغْيَةٌ, (K,) accord. to Th, but others<br>\
hold these two to be simple substs., and some<br>\
mention also بَغْيَةٌ, with fet-h, (TA,) and بُغَايَةٌ,<br>\
(As, S, TA,) He sought; sought for, or after;<br>\
sought, desired, or endeavoured, to find, and take,<br>\
or get; (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.;) a stray-beast,<br>\
(As, S, TA,) or any other thing, (S, Mgh, * Msb, *<br>\
K, * TA,) good or evil; (Lh, TA;) as also ↓ ابتغى<br>\
and ↓ تبغّى (S, Msb, K) and ↓ استبغى: (K:) or<br>\
↓ ابتغى signifies he sought, &amp;c., diligently, studiously, sedulously, or earnestly: (Er-Rághib, TA:)<br>\
and بَغَى signifies also he loved, or affected, a<br>\
thing: (MF, TA:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib, the<br>\
inf. n. signifies the seeking to exceed the just<br>\
bounds in respect of that which one aims at, or<br>\
endeavours after, whether one actually exceed or<br>\
do not; and sometimes it is considered in relation<br>\
to quantity; and sometimes, in relation to quality.<br>\
(TA.) You say, بَغَاهُ بِشَرٍّ [He sought him with<br>\
an evil purpose; or sought to do him evil]. (S<br>\
and K in art. عقب.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And بَغَاهُ He sought, &amp;c.,<br>\
a thing for him; like بَغَى لَهُ. (Lh, Mgh, * K. *)<br>\
You say, بَغَاهُ الشَّىْءَ He sought, &amp;c., the thing for<br>\
him; (S, K;) as also الشَّىْءَ ↓ ابغاهُ: (K:) thus<br>\
you say, اِبْغِنِى كَذَا or كذا ↓ أَبْغِنِى and اِبْغَ لِى<br>\
كذا Seek thou for me such a thing; (TA;) and<br>\
ضَالَّتِى ↓ أَبْغِنِى Seek thou for me my stray-beast:<br>\
(Mgh:) or الشَّىءَ ↓ ابغاهُ signifies He aided, or<br>\
assisted, him to seek the thing: (Ks, K:) or<br>\
كَذَا ↓ أَبْغِنِى signifies Seek thou for me such a<br>\
thing; and also Aid thou me to seek such a thing.<br>\
(JK.) It is said in the Kur [ix. 47], يَبْغُونَكُمُ<br>\
الفِتْنَةَ They seek, or desire, for you discord, or<br>\
dissension; or they seeking, &amp;c.: and in the same<br>\
[iii. 94], تَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا Ye seek, or desire, for it,<br>\
namely, the way [of God], crookedness; or ye<br>\
seeking, &amp;c.: the first objective complement of<br>\
the verb being in the accus. case because of the<br>\
suppression of the preposition ل. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence, app.,] بَغَانِى دَآءً It procured to me<br>\
disease; it caused disease to befall me. (Ham<br>\
p. 794.) And إِنَّهُ لَذُو بُغَايَةٍ Verily he is one who<br>\
makes much gain: (JK, K:) but in the M, ذُو<br>\
بُغَايَةٍ لِلْكَسْبِ, meaning a seeker of gain. (TA.)<br>\
And مَابُغِىَ لَهُ Good was not appointed to betide<br>\
him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  بَغَى عَلَى أَخِيهِ, inf. n. بَغْىٌ, He<br>\
envied his brother; he wished that a blessing, or<br>\
cause of happiness, or an excellence, might become<br>\
transferred from his brother to himself: so says<br>\
Lh, who holds this to be the primary signification<br>\
of the verb. (TA.) It is said in a prov., البَغْىُ<br>\
عِقَالُ النَّصْرِ [Envy is the shackle of aid from God<br>\
against an enemy or a wrongdoer]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
Hence, (Lh, TA,) بَغْىٌ signifies The acting wrongfully, injuriously, or tyrannically; (Lh, S, TA;)<br>\
because the envier so acts towards the envied; his<br>\
endeavour being to cause, by guile, the blessing<br>\
of God upon him to depart from him: (Lh, TA:)<br>\
or the seeking, or endeavouring, to act corruptly,<br>\
wrongly, or unjustly: (Az, TA:) or the exceeding<br>\
the due bounds, or just limits, in any way: (S:)<br>\
accord. to Er-Rághib, it is of two kinds: one of<br>\
these is approved, and this is the passing beyond<br>\
the bounds of equity to exercise beneficence, and<br>\
beyond the bounds of obligatory duties to do what<br>\
is not obligatory: the other is disapproved, and<br>\
this is the passing beyond the bounds of that which<br>\
is true, or right, to do that which is false, or<br>\
wrong, or to do acts of a doubtful nature: but in<br>\
most instances it is that which is disapprove.<br>\
(TA.) You say, بَغَى عَلَيْهِ, (S, K,) and بغى عَلَى<br>\
النَّاسِ, (Az, Msb,) aor.<br>\
بَغِىَ, (K,) inf. n. بَغْىٌ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) He exalted himself against him, or above<br>\
him; overpowered, or oppressed, him; (Fr, S,<br>\
K;) acted wrongfully, injuriously, or tyrannically, towards him; and deviated from the right<br>\
way: (K:) and he acted wrongfully, injuriously,<br>\
or tyrannically, towards men, or the people, (Az,<br>\
Msb,) and sought to annoy them, or hurt them.<br>\
(Az, TA.) Lh mentions, on the authority of Ks,<br>\
the saying, مَا لِى وَلِلْبَغِ بَعْضِكُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ [What<br>\
have I to do with wrongful conduct, the wrongful<br>\
conduct of one of you towards another?], for<br>\
وَلِلْبَغْىِ; ISd thinks, because of the difficulty<br>\
found in pronouncing the kesreh after the ى.<br>\
(TA.) بَغَى also signifies He occupied himself<br>\
with corrupt, wrong, or unjust, conduct: [accord.<br>\
to Fei,] from the same verb [in a sense to be<br>\
mentioned below,] said of a wound. (Msb.) Also,<br>\
aor.<br>\
بَغِىَ, (TA,) inf. n. بَغْىٌ, (Az, TA,) He magnified himself; or behaved proudly, haughtily, or<br>\
insolently: (Az, TA:) because he who does so<br>\
passes beyond the bounds of his proper station to<br>\
a station that does not belong to him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
And [hence,] بَغَى فِى مِشيَتِهِ, (K,) inf. n. بَغْىٌ,<br>\
(TA,) He [app. a horse, and perhaps a man also,]<br>\
was proud, or self-conceited, and quick, in his<br>\
gait: (K:) or بَغْىٌ in a horse, (S, TA,) or in the<br>\
running of a horse, (JK, TA,) is the being proud,<br>\
or self-conceited, with exceeding briskness or liveliness or sprightliness. (JK, S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And بَغَتِ<br>\
السَّمَآءُ, (S, K,) inf. n. بَغْىٌ, (TA,) The sky rained<br>\
vehemently: (A&#39;Obeyd, S, K:) or exceeded, in<br>\
rain, the limit of what was wanted. (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA.) And بَغَى الوَادِى The valley flowed with<br>\
water reaching to a place to which it had not<br>\
reached before. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  بَغَتْ, (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K,) said of a woman, (Th, IKh, S, Msb, and so<br>\
in some copies of the K,) or of a female slave, (so<br>\
in other copies of the K,) but it is not restricted<br>\
to the latter, (TA,) aor.<br>\
بَغِىَ, (JK, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
بِغَآءٌ, (IKh, JK, S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) or بَغْىٌ, (ISd,<br>\
K,) [but the former, only, is commonly known,]<br>\
She committed fornication, or adultery; she prostituted herself; (JK, S, Mgh, Msb, K;) because<br>\
she who does so transgresses her proper bounds;<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ بَاغَتْ, (IKh, S, * Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
بِغَآءٌ (IKh, K) and مُبَاغَاةٌ, (K,) said of a female<br>\
slave: (Msb:) or مباغاة signifies the committing<br>\
fornication, or adultery, with another. (KL.)<br>\
It is said in the Kur [xxiv. 33], وَلَا تُكْرِهُو فَتَيَاتِكُمْ<br>\
عَلَى البِغَآءِ [And compel not ye your young women<br>\
to prostitute themselves]. (Mgh.) And you say,<br>\
↓ خَرَجَتِ المَرْأَةُ تُبَاغِى [The woman went forth for<br>\
prostituting herself]. (S.) Accord. to the Jema etTefáreek, بِغَآءٌ signifies The knowing of a woman&#39;s<br>\
committing fornication or adultery, or prostituting<br>\
herself, and approving, or being content: but this,<br>\
if correct, is an amplification in speech. (Mgh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b9-  بَغَى الجُرْحُ, (JK, S, Msb,) aor.<br>\
بَغَىَ, inf. n. بَغْىٌ,<br>\
(JK,) The wound swelled, (S,) and became in a<br>\
corrupt state, (JK, S, Msb,) and produced thick<br>\
purulent matter. (JK.) And بَرَأَ جُرْحُهُ عَلَى بَغْىٍ<br>\
His wound healed having somewhat of corruption<br>\
in it. (S.) ―<br>\
-b10-  بَغَى, (K,) aor.<br>\
بَغِىَ, inf. n. بَغْىٌ, (TA,)<br>\
also signifies He lied; said what was untrue. (K.)<br>\
مَا نَبْغِى, in the Kur [xii. 65], is said to mean We<br>\
do not lie: and we do not act wrongfully: or it<br>\
may mean what do we seek, or desire? (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, (K,) inf. n. بَغْىٌ, (TA,) He looked at a<br>\
thing [to see] how it was; (K;) and so بَغَا, inf. n.<br>\
بَغْوٌ: mentioned by Kr. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, (K,)<br>\
with the same inf. n., (TA,) He looked, watched,<br>\
or waited, for a person or thing. (Kr, K.)<br>\
3<br>\
بَاْغَىَ see 1, latter part, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Lh<br>\
mentions the saying, addressed to a pretty woman,<br>\
إِنَّكِ لَجَمِيلَةٌ وَلَا تُبَاغِى, as meaning Verily thou<br>\
art pretty, and mayest thou not be smitten by the<br>\
[evil] eye: (TA in this art.:) but accord. to some,<br>\
the verb in this instance belongs to art. بوغ or art.<br>\
بيغ. (TA in art. بوغ.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَبْغَىَ see 1, in five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  ابغاهُ الشَّىْءَ also signifies He made him, or caused him, to seek the<br>\
thing; to seek for it, or after it; to seek, or<br>\

تَبَاغَوْا They acted wrong fully, injuriously,<br>\
or tyrannically, one towards another; exalted<br>\
themselves, one against, or above, another; overpowered, or oppressed, one another. (S, TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انبغى is said in the S to be quasi-pass. of<br>\
بَغَيْتُهُ, like as اِنْكَسَرَ is of كَسَرْتُهُ; and Esh-Shiháb<br>\
says of the aor. that it is quasi-pass. of بَغَاهُ, aor.<br>\
يَبْغِيهِ, in the sense of طَلَبَهُ: (TA:) [Fei says,] it<br>\
has been asserted that انبغى is quasi-pass. of بَغَى;<br>\
but a verb of the measure انفعل is not used as a<br>\
quasi-pass. unless it implies effort, and the consequence of an action, as in the case of كَسَرْتُهُ, of<br>\
which the quasi-pass. is اِنْكَسَرَ; which انبغى does<br>\
not: some, however, allow its being thus used:<br>\
(Msb:) accord. to Zj, it is as though it were syn.<br>\
with اِنْطَلَبَ, as quasi-pass. of طَلَبَ, and means<br>\
It was, or became, suitable, fit, meet, or proper;<br>\
(Zj, TA;) [or right, and allowable; and good:<br>\
or very requisite: (see explanations of exs. following:) or it behooved: and] it was, or became,<br>\
facilitated, or easy; (Er-Rághib, K;) and practicable, or manageable. (Er-Rághib, TA.) Accord.<br>\
to some, this verb is not used in the pret. tense,<br>\
but only in the aor.: it is reckoned among verbs<br>\
imperfectly inflected: (Msb, TA:) but the pret.<br>\
is mentioned by AZ and Sb and Zj, and by ElKhattábee on the authority of Ks; and was often<br>\
used by Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee: it is, however, very rare.<br>\
(TA.) You say, يَنْبَغِى لَكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا [It is<br>\
suitable to thee, or is fit, meet, or proper, &amp;c.,<br>\
for thee, or it behooveth thee, that thou shouldst<br>\
do such a thing]. (S, TA.) And, accord. to Zj,<br>\
اِنْبَغَى لِفُلَانٍ أَنْ يَفْعَلَ, as meaning It was, or became, suitable to such a one, or fit, meet, or proper,<br>\
for him, that he should do, or to do, such a thing.<br>\
(TA.) And مَا يَنْبَغِى لَكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ هٰذَا, (Lh, K,)<br>\
and ↓ ما يُبْتَغَى, (K, TA,) with fet-h to the غ,<br>\
(TA,) and ما انْبَغَى, and ↓ ما ابْتُغِىَ; (Lh, K;) of<br>\
which four phrases, the first is given by Lh as<br>\
explanatory of the third and fourth, and means,<br>\
accord. to Esh-Shiháb, It is not right, proper,<br>\
fit, or meet, nor allowable, for thee that thou<br>\
shouldst do this, or to do this; and it is not good<br>\
for thee &amp;c.; but he adds that only the aor. has<br>\
been heard from the Arabs in this sense. (TA.)<br>\
And يَنْبَغِى أَنْ يَكُونَ كَذَا It is very requisite<br>\
that it should be so, or that such a thing ought<br>\
be; [or it ought to be so, or such a thing ought<br>\
to be; it behooves that it should be so, or such a<br>\
thing behooves;] it is not well that such a thing<br>\
should be neglected, or left undone. (Msb.) And<br>\
Ks is related to have heard, from the Arabs, the<br>\
phrase, مَا يَنْبَغِى أَنْ يَكُونَ كَذَا, meaning It is<br>\
not right that it should be so, or that such a thing<br>\
should be: or it is not good &amp;c. (Msb.) It is<br>\
said in the Kur [xxxvi. 69], وَمَا عَلَّمْنَاهُ الشِّعْرَ وَمَا<br>\
يَنْبَغِى لَهُ, i. e. [And we have not taught him<br>\
poetry, or versification], nor is it right, proper,<br>\
fit, or meet, for him: (Bd:) or nor is it easy to<br>\
him, (Bd, Jel, Er-Rághib,) or practicable to him.<br>\
(Bd, Er-Rághib.)<br>\

القَوْمَ فَبَغَوْهُ and بَغَوْا لَهُ [He asked the people, or<br>\
company of men, to seek a thing for him, and<br>\
they sought it for him]. (Lh, K.)<br>\
بَغْىٌ [originally an inf. n. (see 1)] Much of<br>\
rain; or much rain: in [some of] the copies of<br>\
the K, البطر is erroneously put for المطر: (TA:)<br>\
[and in some, البَغِىُّ for البَغْىُ: in a MS. copy,<br>\
I find البَغِىُّ الكَثِيرُ مِنَ المَطَرِ: and in the CK,<br>\
البَغِىُّ الكَثِيْرُ من النَّظَرِ:] or بَغْىُ السَّمَآءِ signifies<br>\
the main portion, (As, S,) or the vehemence, and<br>\
the main portion, (Lh, JK, TA,) of the rain of<br>\
the sky. (As, Lh, JK, S, TA.) Hence the saying,<br>\
دَفَعْنَا بَغْىَ السَّمَآءِ خَلْفَنَا (As, S, TA) or عَنَّا (Lh,<br>\
TA) [lit. We drove away the main portion, or<br>\
the vehemence, and the main portion, of the rain<br>\
of the sky behind us or from us; meaning it was<br>\
driven away behind us or from us, or it departed;<br>\
as is shown in art. دفع].<br>\

فُلَانٍ بَغْيَةٌ and بُغْيَةٌ [I have among the sons of<br>\
such a one an object of want]: (S:) or the first<br>\
signifies a state that one seeks; and the second, a<br>\
thing itself that one wants: (As, S, Msb: *) and<br>\
the first, (JK,) or third, (K,) signifies also a<br>\
stray beast that is sought: (JK, K:) the pl. of<br>\
the second is بُغًى. (JK.) اِرْتَدَّتْ عَلَى فُلَانٍ بِغْيَتُهُ<br>\
[The thing that he sought was refused to such a<br>\
one] is said of one who finds not what he seeks.<br>\
(TA.).<br>\
بَغُوٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\
بَغِىٌّ, accord. to some, of the measure فَعِيلٌ;<br>\
accord. to others, of the measure فَعُولٌ, originally<br>\
بَغُوىٌ; [if of the former, originally meaning<br>\
“ sought; ” and if of the latter, originally meaning<br>\
“ seeking; ”] and therefore [in either case] not<br>\
admitting the affix ة: (TA:) A fornicatress, an<br>\
adulteress, or a prostitute; (JK, S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ بَغُوٌّ [of the measure فَعُولٌ, and<br>\
therefore anomalous, like نَهُوٌّ]: (M, K:) بَغِىٌّ is<br>\
not applied to a man, (Lh, Msb,) nor بَغِيَّةٌ to a<br>\

-b2-  Also A female slave,<br>\
(JK, S, K,) whether she be a fornicatress or an<br>\

meant to imply revilement, though originally<br>\
applied to female slaves because of their prostitution of themselves: (S:) or a free woman who is<br>\
a fornicatress or an adulteress or a prostitute: so<br>\
in the K: but correctly, or a fornicatress or an<br>\
adulteress or a prostitute, whether free or a slave:<br>\
(TA:) and a female singer, though chaste; because of fornication&#39;s being originally attributable<br>\
to such a person: (Msb:) pl. as above. (JK, S,<br>\

بَغَايَا also signifies The scouts, or companies of<br>\

in a trad. respecting the Hijreh (as said by A booBekr to a man who asked him “ Who are ye? ”),<br>\

[&amp;c.,] means Not being a revolter from the Muslims, (Jel,) or, against the Imám: (TA:) or it<br>\
means not desiring to eat for the sake of enjoyment: or not seeking to exceed the limit of his<br>\
want: (Az, TA:) or not seeking what he should<br>\
not seek. (Er-Rághib, TA.) فِئَةٌ بَاغِيَهٌ A company<br>\
