&amp;c.: here the measure تَفَاعُلٌ has not its proper<br>\

بَدْهٌ and بُدْهٌ: see بُدَاهَةٌ.<br>\
عَلَى بَدِيةٍ, and بَدِيهًا: see بَدِيهَةٌ<br>\
بَدَاهَةٌ: see بُدَاهَةٌ, in two places.<br>\

بَدَهَهُ بِأَمْرٍ, (JK, S,) meaning The first of anything; and an occurrence thereof by which one<br>\

the one from the other]. (Az, TA.) And لَحِقَهُ<br>\
فِى بُدَاهَةِ جَرْيِهِ [He overtook him in the first<br>\
part of his running]. (Z, TA.) ISd thinks that<br>\
in all these cases the ه is a substitute for ء. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence,] ↓ غَمْرُ البَدِيْهَةِ [properly Fleet in the first<br>\
part of his running; meaning] (tropical:)  a man who takes<br>\
by surprise with large bounty. (TA, in art. غمر.)<br>\

(M, Mbr, TA art. بدأ.) And أَجَابَ عَلَى البَديهَةِ<br>\
(K) He answered, or replied, on the first of his<br>\
being taken unawares. (TA.) [↓ عَلَى بَدِيهٍ is<br>\
mentioned by Freytag, but on what authority<br>\
he does not say, as meaning Unpreparedly, suddenly, or unexpectedly; and so ↓ بَدِيهًا by Golius,<br>\
as on the authority of J, but I do not find it<br>\
in the S in the present article.] And رَآهُ بَدِيهَةً,<br>\
signifies He saw him suddenly, or unexpectedly.<br>\
(TA.) And بَدِيهَةُ الرَّأْىِ, Suddenly formed, unpremeditated, judgment or opinion. (Msb.) ―<br>\

بَدِيهَةٌ and ↓ بُدَاهَةٌ both signify The coming, of<br>\
speech, without premeditation: and the coming<br>\
suddenly, unexpectedly, or unawares. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And ↓ the latter, [and more commonly the former,]<br>\
An intuitive knowledge, notion, or idea; such<br>\
as that one is the half of two; being, with respect<br>\
to knowledge, like بَدِيعٌ with respect to intellect:<br>\
(Kull:) [or] the former signifies the faculty of<br>\
judging rightly at the first of an unexpected occurrence: [intuition, or intuitive perception:] accord. to &#39; Alee-Ibn-Dháfir El-Haddád, it signifies<br>\
primarily اِرْتِجَالٌ فِى الكَلَامِ [i. e. the faculty of<br>\
extemporizing: or speaking, or composing, extemporaneously, impromptu, without premeditation]: and predominantly, the poetizing, or versifying, impromptu, without premeditation or consideration: except that ارتجال is quicker than<br>\
بديهة. (TA.) You say, هُوَ ذُو بَدِيهَةٍ (K) He has<br>\
a faculty of judging rightly at the first of an<br>\
unexpected occurrence. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ ذُو<br>\
بَدِيهَةٍ حَسَنَةٍ Such a one has a good faculty of<br>\
extemporizing; or of uttering, or relating, things<br>\
by means of the promptness of his intelligence.<br>\
(TA, in art. بدأ: see بَدِيْةٌ. CCC ) And هٰذَا مَعْلُومٌ<br>\
فِى بَدَائِهِ العُقُولِ [This is known among the intuitive notions of intellects; i. e., intuitively]. (K, *<br>\
TA.) بَدَائِهُ seems to be pl. of بَدِيهَةٌ, as in the<br>\
phrase, (TA,) لَهُ بَدَائِهُ, i. e. بَدَائِعُ [He has new,<br>\
or admirable, things that he utters], (K, TA,) in<br>\
speech, or language, and poetry, and in answering, or replying: but here it is not improbable<br>\
that the ه may be a substitute for the ع. (TA.)<br>\
بَدِيهِىٌّ [Intuitive knowledge;] such that its<br>\
origination does not rest upon speculation, and<br>\
acquisition by study, whether it do, or do not,<br>\
require some other thing, as conjecture or experience &amp;c.; (KT, Kull;) so that it is [sometimes] syn. with ضَرُورِىٌّ [and opposed to نَظَرِىٌّ]:<br>\
and sometimes it means such as does not require<br>\
anything whatever after the intellect has directed<br>\
itself; so that it is more particular than ضَرُورِىٌّ:<br>\
(KT:) as the conception of heat and cold, and<br>\
the assent of the mind to the position that negation<br>\
and affirmation cannot be co-existent, nor be<br>\
simultaneously non-existent, in the same instance.<br>\
(KT, Kull.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,] A mere simpleton<br>\
or fool: but this is post-classical. (TA.)<br>\
رَجُلٌ مِبْدَهٌ (S) A man possessing in a large<br>\
degree the faculty of extemporizing, or of judging<br>\
rightly at the first of an unexpected occurrence;<br>\
firm, or steady, in speech or discourse, or whose<br>\
tongue makes no slip in contentions, when he is<br>\
taken unawares. (Har p. 64.)<br>\
