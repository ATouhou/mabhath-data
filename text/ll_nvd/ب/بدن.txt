بَدُنَ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
بَدُنَ; (T,<br>\
S;) and بَدَنَ, aor.<br>\
بَدُنَ; (T, S, M, Msb, K;) inf. n.<br>\
بَدَانَةٌ (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) of the former, (ISk, T, S,<br>\
&amp;c.,) and بُدْنٌ, (T, S, M, K,) also of the former,<br>\
(ISk, T,) or of the latter, (S,) and بَدْنٌ, (M, K,)<br>\
accord. to AZ, (T,) and بَدَانٌ, (M, K,) or بُدُونٌ<br>\
is the inf. n. of the latter verb; (Msb;) said of a<br>\
man, (ISk, T, S,) and of a camel; (Msb;) and<br>\
بَدُنَتْ and بَدَنَتْ, said of a woman, (AZ, T, M,<br>\
K,) and of a بَدَنَة, q. v.; (Zj, T, &amp;c.;) He, and<br>\
she, was, or became, big, bulky, big-bodied, or<br>\
corpulent; (ISk, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;)<br>\
abounding in flesh; (T;) fat: (Zj, T, M:) or<br>\
the former verb has this last signification, that of<br>\
fatness; and the latter verb is syn. with بَدَّنَ<br>\
q. v. (Ham p. 158.) [See also بُدْنٌ, below.]<br>\
2<br>\
بدّن, inf. n. تَبْدِينٌ, He (a man, T, S, M)<br>\
was, or became, aged, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
and weak: (M, K:) or he was, or became, heavy<br>\
by reason of age; as also ↓بَدَنَ. (Ham p. 158.)<br>\
-A2-  He clad a man with a بَدَن, i. e. a دِرْع [or<br>\
coat of mail]. (K,* TA.)<br>\
بُدْنٌ [properly an inf. n.; see 1:] Fatness and<br>\
compactness;  as also ↓ بُدُنٌ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Fat;<br>\
i. e. the substance termed شَحْمٌ. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
It is also a pl. of بَدَنَةٌ: (T, S, &amp;c.:) ―<br>\
-b2-  and of<br>\
بَادِنٌ. (M, TA.)<br>\
بَدَنٌ The body, without the head and arms<br>\
and legs; (M, Msb, K;) so says Az: (Msb:) or<br>\
the body without the arms and legs: (Mgh:) or<br>\
[the part] from the shoulder-joint to the posteriors<br>\
[inclusive]: (TA [as from the Mgh, in my copy<br>\
of which it is not found]:) or the جَسَدَ [generally<br>\
meaning the body together with the members] of<br>\
a man; (S;) often applied. to the whole of the<br>\
جَسَد; (Az, TA;) and in the Kur x. 92 it is said<br>\
to mean the body without soul: (S:) pl. أَبْدَانٌ;<br>\
(M, Msb;) whence the phrase, mentioned by Lh,<br>\
إِنَّهَا لَحَسَنَةُ الأَبْدَانِ [meaning Verily she is beautiful in respect of the body], as though the term<br>\
بَدَنٌ were applied to every portion of her. (M.)<br>\
شِرْكَةُ الأَبْدَانِ is originally شِرْكَةٌ بِالأَبْدَانِ, meaning Copartnership in bodily labours for the acquirement of gains. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (tropical:)  The<br>\
part of a shirt, (Mgh, Msb,) and of a [garment<br>\
of the kind called] جُبَّة, (Mgh,) that lies against<br>\
the back and the belly, [i. e. the body thereof,]<br>\
without the sleeves and the دَخَارِيص [or gores with<br>\
which it is widened]: (Mgh, Msb:) pl. as above.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A short دِرْع [or coat of mail],<br>\
(S, M, K,) of the measure of the body: (M:) or<br>\
it is [a coat of mail] like a دِرْع, except that it is<br>\
short, only such as covers the body, with short<br>\
sleeves: (T:) or, as some say, any دِرْع: (M:)<br>\
and so it is said to mean in the Kur x. 92 by<br>\
IAar (T) and by Th; (M;) but Akh says that<br>\
this assertion is of no account: (S:) pl. as above.<br>\
(M, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A small [garment of the kind<br>\
called] جُبَّة; as being likened to a coat of mail.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Accord. to Kr, (M,) A limb, or member: or, specially, the limbs, or members, of a<br>\
slaughtered camel: (M, K: [in the latter of<br>\
which, the former of these two explanations is<br>\
improperly connected with the first in this paragraph by the conjunction او:]) to these he specially applies it in one instance: pl. as above.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also An old, or aged, man: (K:) or so<br>\
رَجُلٌ بَدَنٌ. (T, S, M.) [In like manner, ↓ بَادِنٌ<br>\
and ↓ بَدِنٌ are said by Golius, as on the authority<br>\
of the S, to signify annosus et senior, applied to a<br>\
man, and also to a woman; but this explanation<br>\
is wrong; and the latter word I do not find in<br>\
any lexicon.] ―<br>\
-b7-  And An old mountain-goat:<br>\
(M, K:) or so وَعِلٌ بَدَنٌ: (S:) [in the present<br>\
day, بَدَن is applied to the wild goat of the<br>\
Arabian and Egyptian deserts and mountains;<br>\
the capra jaela of Hamilton Smith; called by<br>\
some an ibex; as is also تَيْتَل, properly ثَيْتَلٌ:]<br>\
pl. [of pauc.] أَبْدُنُ (M, K [in the CK, erroneously, أَبْدَنٌ]) and [of mult.] بُدُونٌ, which is extr.<br>\
[with respect to rule], on the authority of IAar.<br>\
(M, TA.) The rájiz says, describing a bitch (S,<br>\
M) and a mountain-goat, (M, TA,)<br>\
قَدْ قُلْتُ لَمَّا بَدَتِ العُقَابُ<br>\
وَضَمَّهَا وَالبَدَنَ الحِقَابٌ<br>\
جِدِّى لِكُلِّ عَامِلٍ ثَوَابُ<br>\
اَلرَّأْسُ وَالأَكْرُعُ وَالإِهَابُ<br>\
(S, * M, * TA,) [I had said, when El-&#39; Ikáb appeared, and El-Hikáb comprised her and the old<br>\
mountain-goat, “Exert thyself: for every worker<br>\
there is a recompense: the head and the shanks<br>\
and the hide shall be thine”]: العقاب is the name<br>\
of a bitch, and الحقاب is a certain mountain: he<br>\
says, “Catch thou this goat, and I will make thy<br>\
recompense to be the head and the shanks and<br>\
the hide.” (TA.) [Hence Golius has been led<br>\
to mistake الحِقَاب for a signification of البَدَنُ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  (assumed tropical:)  The lineage, or parentage, of a man, and his<br>\
grounds of pretension to respect or honour. (M,<br>\
K.)<br>\
بَدِنٌ: see بَدَنٌ<br>\
بُدُنٌ: see بُدْنٌ.<br>\
-A2-  It is also a pl. of بَدَنَةٌ. (M,<br>\
K, &amp;c.)<br>\
بَدَنَةٌ A she-camel, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
and a male camel, (T, M, Mgh, K,) and a cow,<br>\
(T, S, M, Mgh, * Msb, K,) and a bull, (M, K,)<br>\
accord. to some, (Msb,) or properly the first of<br>\
these, (Mgh, Msb,) and the second, (Mgh,) but<br>\
made by the Sunneh to apply to a cow also,<br>\
(Mgh, * Msb,) that is slaughtered at Mekkeh,<br>\
(S,) or that is, (M, K,) or may be, (T,) brought<br>\
thither for sacrifice; (T, M, K;) so called because<br>\
they used to fatten them, (S,) or because of their<br>\
greatness, or bulkiness: (T, Mgh, Msb:) not<br>\
applied to a sheep or goat: (T, Msb, TA:) En-Nawawee erroneously cites the T as asserting<br>\
that it is thus applied; misled, it is said, by an<br>\
omission in his copy: (MF, TA:) pl. بَدَنَاتٌ, (T,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) a pl. of pauc., (Mgh,) and بُدْنٌ, (T,<br>\
S, M, Msb,) or بُدُنٌ, (Mgh, K,) or both, (M,<br>\
Msb, TA,) the former being a contraction of the<br>\
latter, which seems to be pl. of بَدِينٌ: (Msb:)<br>\
one should not use بَدَنٌ as a pl. of بَدَنَةٌ; though<br>\
they used to say خَشَبٌ and أَجَمٌ &amp;c. (M, TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
بَدَنِىٌّ Of, or relating to, the بَدَن, or body;<br>\
corporeal. ―<br>\
-b2-  See also بَادِنٌ.]<br>\
بَدِينٌ: see بَادِنٌ, in four places.<br>\
بَادِنٌ, applied to a man, Big, bulky, big-bodied,<br>\
or corpulent; (ISk, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ بَدِينٌ (Msb, K) and ↓ مُبَدَّنٌ (M, K) [and<br>\
↓ بَدَنِىٌّ]: and fat; as also ↓ مُبَدَّنٌ: (T, M:) or<br>\
heavy in body; heavy by reason of age: and<br>\
↓ بَدِينٌ signifies fat: (Ham p. 158:) بَادِنٌ is likewise applied to a woman, (S, M, Msb, K,) as are<br>\
also بَادِنَةٌ (M, Mgh, K) and ↓ بَدِينٌ (S, K) and<br>\
↓ مُبَدَّنَةٌ: (T, M:) the pl. is بُدَّنٌ (M, Msb, K)<br>\
and بُدْنٌ (M, TA) and بُدُنٌ; (Msb, K;) the first<br>\
of these being pl. of بَادِنٌ, (M, Msb,) and so the<br>\
second; (M;) and the third being pl. of ↓ بَدِينٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) See also بَدَنٌ.<br>\
مُبَدَّنٌ, and with ة: see بَادِنٌ, in three places.<br>\
مِبْدَانٌ That becomes fat quickly, with little<br>\
fodder [or food]. (M, K.)<br>\
