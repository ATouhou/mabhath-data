بَشَامٌ [The tree of the balsam of Mekkeh;<br>\

his Flora Aegypt. Arab. p. ex. as growing in the<br>\
middle mountainous region of El-Yemen, and<br>\
described by him in p. 79 of the same work; in<br>\
both places as being called in Arabic ابو شام,<br>\
which is a mistake for بشام;] a certain odoriferous<br>\
kind of tree, (S K,) of sweet taste, (TA,) the<br>\
leaves of which, (AHn, K) pounded, and mixed<br>\
with الحِنَّآء [or the leaves of the Lawsonia inermis],<br>\
(AHn,) blacken the hair; (AHn, K) it is a kind<br>\
of tree having a stem and branches, and small leaves,<br>\
but larger than the leaves of the [species of marjoram called] صَعْتَر, and having no fruit; [but<br>\
only, as Forskål states, a blackish seed, which is<br>\
abortive;] when its leaf or its branch is cut, it<br>\
pours forth a white milk; (AHn, TA;) and its<br>\
twigs are used for cleaning the teeth: (S, K:)<br>\
n. un. with ة. (TA.) In a trad., mention is<br>\
