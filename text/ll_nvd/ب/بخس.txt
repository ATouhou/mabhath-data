بَخَسَهُ, aor.<br>\
بَخَسَ, inf. n. بَخْسٌ, He diminished<br>\
it; lessened it; made it deficient, or defective:<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K:) or he made it faulty. (Msb.)<br>\
You say, بَخَسَ الكَيَّالُ [for بَخَسَ الكَيَّالُ الكَيْلَ<br>\
The measurer made defective measure]. (A.)<br>\
And of a just sale, لَا بَخْسَ فِيهِ وَ لَا شَطَطَ, (S,) or<br>\
وَلَا شُطُوطَ, (T, TA,) [There is no deficiency in it<br>\
nor excess.] And it is said in the Kur [lxxii. 13],<br>\
فَلَا يَخَافُ بَخْسًا وَلَا رَهَقًا He shall not fear diminution of the reward of his actions, nor wrong, or<br>\
injustice. (TA.) And in this sense, [as also in<br>\
the next,] the verb is doubly trans. (Msb.) You<br>\
say, بَخَسَهُ حَقَّهُ He diminished to him his right,<br>\
or due; deprived him, or defrauded him, of a<br>\
part of it. (S, A.) And it is said in the Kur<br>\
[vii. 83 and xi. 86 and xxvi. 183], وَلَا تَبْخَسُوا<br>\
النَّاسَ أَشْيَآءَهُمْ [And ye shall not diminish unto<br>\
men their things]: (Msb:) or the verb in this<br>\
instance has the signification next following.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He wronged him; acted wrongfully,<br>\
or unjustly, towards him. (A, K.)<br>\
-A2-  بَخَسَ<br>\
عَيْنَهُ: see بَخَصَ.<br>\
6<br>\
تباخسوا They defrauded one another in a<br>\
sale. (K.)<br>\
بَخْسٌ Deficient; defective. (S.) It is said in<br>\
the Kur [xii. 20], وَشَرَوْهُ بِثَمَنٍ بَخْسٍ And they<br>\
sold him for a deficient, or defective, price: (S, *<br>\
Msb, * TA:) or for a price less than was incumbent: or for an insufficient price: or for an<br>\
unjust price; accord. to Zj; because the sale of a<br>\
man that has been found is unlawful. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Land that produces herbage without being [artificially] watered: (JK, S, K:) or land which is<br>\
watered by the rain; because it has deficient<br>\
watering: (Mgh:) pl. بُخُوسٌ. (JK, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, (TA, as from Ibn-Málik,) or ↓ بَخْسِىٌّ,<br>\
[which is more probably the correct form,] a<br>\
rel. n. from بَخْسٌ in the sense immediately preceding, explained in the T as signifying, (Mgh,)<br>\
Seed-produce that is not irrigated with water<br>\
from a spring or well or the like, but only by the<br>\
rain. (Mgh, and TA from Ibn-Málik.)<br>\
بَخْسِىٌّ: see بَخْسٌ.<br>\
بَاخِسٌ Any one who acts wrongfully, or unjustly. (TA.) It is said in a prov., تَحْسِبُهَا حَمْقَآءَ<br>\
وَ هِىَ بَاخِسٌ; (S, A, K;) so runs the prov.; but<br>\
accord. to Th, (S,) you may also say بَاخِسَةٌ; (S,<br>\
K;) i. e., [Thou thinkest her stupid,] but she is<br>\
wrongful, or unjust: applied to him who feigns<br>\
himself to be of weak understanding when he is<br>\
crafty and cunning. (K, TA.) The origin of the<br>\
prov. was this: a man of the Benu-l-&#39; Ambar,<br>\
of Temeem, mixed his property with that of a<br>\
woman, coveting the possession of it, and thinking<br>\
that she was stupid, and that she did not take<br>\
care of her property nor know it: then he made<br>\
a division with her, after he had mixed; but she<br>\
was not content with the division until she took<br>\
her property: she complained of him to those in<br>\
authority, so that he released himself from her by<br>\
giving her what she desired of the property: and<br>\
the man was reproved for his conduct; it being<br>\
said to him, “Thou cheatest a woman: is not this<br>\
wrongful conduct (بَخْس)? ” whereupon he replied<br>\
in the words above, which became a proverb.<br>\
