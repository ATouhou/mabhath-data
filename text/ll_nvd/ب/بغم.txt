↓ تبغّمت; (K;) She (a gazelle) uttered a cry:<br>\
(S:) or uttered her softest, or gentlest, cry (JK,<br>\

male gazelle: and the verb is also used transitively, said of a female gazelle uttering this cry to<br>\
her young one. (JK.) Also, (S, K,) ↓ both<br>\
verbs, (K,) She (a camel) uttered a cry without<br>\
clearness: (S:) or uttered a broken, or an interrupted, not a prolonged, yearning cry, to, or for,<br>\
her young one: (K:) or uttered a weak cry,<br>\
below that [grumbling cry] which is termed رُغَآء.<br>\
(Ham p. 233.) [See an ex. in a verse of Dhu-rRummeh cited voce إِلَّا.] And بَغَمَ and ↓ تبغّم said<br>\
of the ثَيْتَل and إِيَّل and وَعِل, [all of which words<br>\

TA:) or المُبَاغَمَةٌ is like المُنَاغَمَةُ, and means the<br>\
speaking [with another] faintly; taken from the<br>\
بُغَام [see 1] of the gazelle and the she-camel:<br>\
(Ham p. 233:) or the holding amatory and enticing talk, or conversation, with another, with<br>\
a soft, or gentle, voice. (TA.)<br>\

cries, &amp;c., one to another]: and بِغِزْلَانٍ يَتَبَاغَمْنَ<br>\

(TA.)<br>\
بُغْمَةٌ A thing like the قِلَادَة, [a necklace,]<br>\
