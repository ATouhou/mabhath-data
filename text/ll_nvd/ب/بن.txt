بنّن, (K,) inf. n. تَبْنِينٌ, (TA,) He tied a<br>\
sheep, or goat, in order to fatten it: (K:) from<br>\
بَنَّ بِالْمَكَانِ. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
ابنّ بِالْمَكَانِ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
إِبْنَانٌ; (Lth, T;) and بِهِ ↓ بَنَّ, aor. يَبِنُّ, (M, K,)<br>\
inf. n. بَنٌّ; (M, TA;) but As allows only the<br>\
former verb; (M, TA;) He remained, continued,<br>\
stayed, dwelt, or abode, in the place; (T, S, M,<br>\
Msb, K;) he kept, or clave, to the place. (Lth,<br>\
T, TA.) Accord. to Z, it is a tropical meaning,<br>\
from the بَنَّة [i. e. odour] of the camels or cattle<br>\
[of a stationary people]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And أَبَنَّتِ<br>\
السَّحَابَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The cloud remained, or continued raining, (M, TA,) some days, (TA,) and kept its<br>\
place. (M.)<br>\
5<br>\
تبنّن He acted, or proceeded, deliberately,<br>\
not hastily. (T, TA.) An Arab of the desert<br>\
said to Shureyh, on his desiring to pronounce<br>\
judgment against him hastily, تَبَنَّنْ, meaning Act<br>\
thou deliberately, not hastily. (T.)<br>\
بَنْ is a dial. var. of بَلْ, (M, K,) and so is<br>\
لَا بَنْ of لَا بَلْ; or, as some say, formed by substitution [of ن for ل; not peculiar to any dialect].<br>\
(M.) One says, بَنْ وَاللّٰهِ لَا آتِيكَ [Nay, by God, I<br>\
will not come to thee]: Fr says that it is of the dial.<br>\
of Benoo-Saad and Kelb; and that he had heard<br>\
the Báhilees say, لَا بَنْ, meaning بَلْ [or لَا بَلْ]:<br>\
but IJ says, I do not trace up بَنْ [to any authority] as being an independent word of a particular<br>\
dialect. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [بْنُ and بْنِ and بْنَ, for ابْنُ<br>\
&amp;c.: see art. بنى.]<br>\
بُنٌّ [Coffee-berries, whether green or roasted,<br>\
whole or reduced to powder by pounding or<br>\
grinding;] expl. in the K as شَىْءٌ يُتَّخَذُ كَالمُرِّىِّ<br>\
[a certain thing that is taken like the condiment<br>\
termed مُرِّيّ, which is used to give relish to food<br>\
or to quicken the appetite]; Ibn-Es-Sim&#39;ánee says,<br>\
هُوَشَىْءٌ فِى الكَوَامِيخِ [app. meaning it is a thing<br>\
reckoned among what are termed كواميخ, pl. of<br>\
كَامَخٌ, which signifies the same as مُرِّىٌّ, for it seems<br>\
that فى is here used in the sense of مِنْ, or it<br>\
may be a mistranscription for مِنْ]; the physician<br>\
Dáwood says, it is the produce of certain trees in<br>\
El-Yemen; the berries thereof are put into the<br>\
earth in آذَار [the Syrian month corresponding to<br>\
March, O. S.], and it increases, and is gathered<br>\
in أَبِيب [the Coptic month commencing on the<br>\
25th of June, O. S.; the 7th of July, N. S.];<br>\
it grows to the height of about three cubits, on a<br>\
stem of the thickness of the thumb, and has a<br>\
white flower, which is succeeded by a berry like<br>\
the hazel-nut; sometimes it is cut like beans;<br>\
and sometimes, when it is divested of its covering,<br>\
it divides into two halves: it has been proved to<br>\
be good for alleviating humidities, and cough,<br>\
and phlegm, and defluxions, and for opening<br>\
obstructions, and causing a flow of the urine:<br>\
when roasted, [and pounded or ground,] and well<br>\
cooked, [i. e. boiled in water,] it is now commonly<br>\
known by the name of قَهْوَة. (TA.) [Golius, I<br>\
think, has misunderstood the explanation of this<br>\
word in the K: after having given that explanation, and rendered it by “ res quæ sumitur instar<br>\
المرى Múrriji,” he adds, “Pers. ابكامه Abcâma<br>\
dictæ: hæc sorbitio est rei ex hordeo et frumento<br>\
paratæ multa cura et arte, quam Malajesa et<br>\
Halimæus describunt. ” He then mentions the<br>\
signification of coffee-berries as a second and distinct meaning.]<br>\
بِنٌّ A place having a fetid odour. (Fr, T, K.)<br>\
-A2-  It also signifies طِرْقٌ مِنَ الشَّحْمِ (T, K) and<br>\
السِّمَنِ (K, TA: in the CK السَّمْنِ:) [said in the<br>\
TA to mean قُوَّةٌ مِنْهُمَا, i. e. Strength arising from<br>\
fat and from fatness: but I think that وَالسِّمَنِ<br>\
has been added in the K in consequence of a<br>\
misunderstanding, and that the meaning is a layer<br>\
of fat; this meaning seeming to be indicated by<br>\
the ex. here following, and corroborated by significations of several conjugates of طِرْقٌ, as طَرِيقَةٌ<br>\
and طَرَقٌ and طِرَاقٌ &amp;c.] One says (T, K) of a<br>\
beast (دَابَّة) when it has become fat, (T,) رَكِبَهَا بِنٌّ<br>\
عَلَىبِنٍ (T, K *) and طِرْقٌ عَلَى طِرْقٍ (T) [clearly<br>\
I think, meaning Layer upon layer, of fat, has<br>\
accumulated upon it.]<br>\
بَنَّةٌ A sweet, or pleasant, odour; (As, AA, T,<br>\
S, M, K;) such as that of the apple (T, M) and<br>\
the like, (M,) or the quince: (T:) Sb says that<br>\
it is a name for a sweet, or pleasant, odour, like<br>\
خَمْطَةٌ: (M, * TA:) and an unpleasant odour;<br>\
(As, T, S;) a fetid odour; (M, K;) whence<br>\
بَنَّةٌ الغَزْلِ [the odour of the yarn] occurring in a<br>\
saying of &#39;Alee, respecting a weaver; (M;) which<br>\
shows that A&#39;Obeyd erred in asserting it to have<br>\
only the first of the foregoing significations; (IB,<br>\
TA;) which Suh, in the R, assigns also to ↓ بُنَانَةٌ:<br>\
(TA:) the odour of sheep, or goats, (S, M,) or of<br>\
camels or cattle; (Z, TA;) and of the dung of<br>\
gazelles; (S, K;) and of the lodging-places of<br>\
sheep or goats and of oxen or bulls or cows and of<br>\
gazelles: (T, M:) and sometimes the lodgingplaces themselves, of sheep or goats: (M, TA:)<br>\
pl. (in all the senses, M) بِنَانٌ. (T, S, M, K.)<br>\
بُنِّىٌّ A seller of بُنّ [or coffee-berries]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, [vulgarly pronounced بِنِّى,] A species of<br>\
fish; (K;) [the cyprinus Bynni of Forskål;<br>\
described by him in his Descr. Anim. p. 71;] it<br>\
is white, and is the best kind [of fish], and<br>\
abundant in the Nile. (TA.)<br>\
بَنَانٌ The fingers; syn. أَصَابِعُ: (M, Msb, K:)<br>\
but whether it means peculiarly the اصابع of the<br>\
hand, or those of the foot also, [i. e. the toes,] is<br>\
disputed: (TA:) or the ends, or extremities,<br>\
thereof: (S, M, Msb, K:) said to be so called<br>\
because by their means are ordered those circumstances whereby man continues in existence; from<br>\
أَبَنَّ بِالْمَكَانِ: (Msb:) mentioned in the Kur viii. 12<br>\
because therewith one fights, and defends himself:<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA:) or it there signifies all the<br>\
limbs, or members, of the body: (Aboo-Is-hák,<br>\
M:) or the fingers, or toes, and any other parts<br>\
of all the limbs, or members: (Zj, TA:) or it<br>\
means in the Kur the شَوَى; (Lth, T, TA;) so in<br>\
lxxv. 4; (M;) i. e. the arms or hands and the<br>\
legs or feet: (Lth, T, TA:) accord. to El-Fárisee<br>\
the meaning of the words in the Kur lxxv. 4 is,<br>\
we are able to make their extremities like those<br>\
of the camel, so that they should not profit by<br>\
them in handicraft: (M, TA:) the n. un. is with<br>\
ة; (Lth, T, S, M, K;) meaning, accord. to Lth,<br>\
a single إِصْبَع [i. e. finger, or toe]; or, accord. to<br>\
AHeyth, the whole اصبع; or, as some say, the<br>\
highest عُقْدَة [or joint] of the اصبع: (T:) the pl.<br>\
of pauc. is بَنَانَاتٌ; but a pl. of mult. is sometimes<br>\
used as one of pauc.; and hence the saying of the<br>\
rájiz,<br>\
خَمْسَ بَنَانٍ قَانِئِ الأَظْفَارِ<br>\
[Five fingers, or ends of fingers, intensely red<br>\
from the dye of hinnà in the nails], meaning<br>\
خَمْسًا مِنَ البَنَانِ: and one says, بَنَانٌ مُخَضَّبٌ<br>\
[Fingers, or ends of fingers, dyed, or much dyed,<br>\
with hinnà]; for every pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]<br>\
between which and its sing., or n. un., there is no<br>\
difference but ة [added in the latter] may be<br>\
treated as sing. and masc. (S.) Lth cites as an<br>\
ex. of the n. un.,<br>\
لَيْسَ لِحَىٍّ فَوْقَهُمْ بَنَانَهْ  لَاهُمَّ أَكْرَمْتَ بَنِى كِنَانَه<br>\
meaning [O God, Thou hast honoured the sons<br>\
of Kináneh: there belongs not to any tribe] excel-lence of the measure of a finger above them. (T,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
بَنِيِنٌ Deliberate and intelligent: (AA, T, K:)<br>\
from بَنَّ بِالْمَكَانِ. (TA.)<br>\
بَنَانَةٌ n. un. of بَنَانٌ. (Lth, T, S, M, K.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also what next follows.<br>\
بُنَانَةٌ: see بَنَّةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A meadow, or verdant<br>\
tract of land somewhat watery, (AA, T, M, K,)<br>\
producing herbage, (M, K,) and adorned with<br>\
flowers; (TA;) and so ↓ بَنَانَةٌ. (M.)<br>\
مُبِنٌّ Remaining, continuing, staying, dwelling,<br>\
or abiding, in a place. (T, TA.) Applied to a<br>\
mixture of urine and dung (عَبَس) upon the tail<br>\
[of a camel &amp;c.], it may mean Cleaving, and<br>\
sticking: or it may be from بَنَّةٌ signifying “ a<br>\
fetid odour ” [so as to mean having a fetid odour]:<br>\
thus, in this case, it may be either a part. n. or a<br>\
possessive epithet. (M, TA.) It signifies also<br>\
Having the odour of the dung of gazelles; applied<br>\
to a covert, or hiding-place, of those animals,<br>\
among trees. (S, K. *)<br>\
