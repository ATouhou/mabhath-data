بَلِهَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
بَلَهَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
بَلَهٌ, (S, * Msb, K, * TA,) [and irregularly بَلَاهَةٌ<br>\
and بُلَهْنِيَةٌ, (see بَلَهٌ, below,)] He was, or became,<br>\
أَبْلَه [q. v.]; as also ↓ تبلّه; (S, K;) and ↓ ابتله:<br>\
(TA:) or he was, or became, weak in intellect.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He was unable to adduce his<br>\
argument, proof, or evidence, (K, TA,) by reason<br>\
of his heedlessness, and his smallness, or lack, of<br>\
discrimination. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
مُبَالَهَةٌ The showing stupidity [in an action<br>\
or in one&#39;s actions, i. e. the acting stupidly,] with<br>\
any one. (KL.) [You say, بالههُ He acted stupidly,<br>\
or in the manner of him who is termed أَبْلَه, with<br>\
him.]<br>\
4<br>\
ابلههُ He found him, or knew him by experience, to be أَبْلَه [q. v.]. (K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تبلّه: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  And see 6. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  He<br>\
journeyed, or proceeded, or pursued his way,<br>\
without any sign of the road, or any track, to<br>\
guide him, (Az, K, TA,) without following the<br>\
right course, (Az, TA,) and without asking [to be<br>\
directed]. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  He prosecuted a<br>\
search after a stray, or lost, beast. (JK, K.)<br>\
6<br>\
تباله He feigned بَلَه, or the attribute denoted<br>\
by the term أَبْلَه: (S:) or he made use of that<br>\
attribute [as a mask]; i . q. اِسْتَعْمَلَ البَلَهَ; as also<br>\
↓ تبلّه. (K.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِبْتَلَهَ see 1.<br>\
بَلْهَ is an indecl. word with fet-h for its termination, like كَيْفَ, and means دَعْ [Let alone, or<br>\
say nothing of]; (S;) [i. e.] it is a noun for دَعْ;<br>\
indecl.; (Mughnee, K;) a verbal noun, meaning<br>\
دَعْ and أُتْرُكْ; (IAth, TA;) and the noun that<br>\
follows it, when it is thus used, is in the accus.<br>\
case; (Mughnee, K;) i. e. it is indecl., with<br>\
fet-h for its termination, when the noun following<br>\
it is in the accus. case; so that you say, بَلْهَ زَيْدًا<br>\
[Let alone Zeyd, or say nothing of Zeyd]; like<br>\
as you say, رُوَيْدَ زَيْدًا: (IB, TA:) and it is also<br>\
an inf. n. in the sense of التَّرْكُ; likewise with<br>\
fet-h for its termination, but decl.; and when it<br>\
is thus used, the noun that follows it is in<br>\
the gen. case; (Mughnee, K;) or it is put<br>\
in the place of an inf. n., meaning تَرْكَ [which<br>\
is virtually the same as اُتْرُكْ and دَعْ], and is<br>\
prefixed to a noun in the gen. case; so that<br>\
you say, بَلْهَ زَيْدٍ, i. e. تَرْكَ زَيْدٍ [which is virtually<br>\
the same as بَلْهَ زَيْدًا explained above; for تَرْكَ زَيْدٍ<br>\
is originally اُتْرُكْ زَيْدًا تَرْكًا, like as فَضَرْبَ الرِّقَابِ<br>\
in the Kur xlvii. 4 is originally فاضْرِبُوا الرِّقَابَ<br>\
ضَرْبًا]; (IAth, TA;) for in this case it cannot be<br>\
regarded as a verbal noun, since verbal nouns<br>\
are not prefixed to other nouns, governed by<br>\
them in the gen. case: (IB, TA:) and it is also<br>\
a noun syn. with كَيْفَ [How?]; likewise with<br>\
fet-h for its termination, indecl.; and when it is<br>\
thus used, the noun that follows it is in the nom.<br>\
case. (Mughnee, K.) A poet says, describing<br>\
swords, (S, Mughnee,) namely, Kaab Ibn-Málik,<br>\
(S,)<br>\
تَذَرُ الجَمَاجِمَ ضَاحِيًا هَامَتُهَا<br>\
بَلْهَ الأَكُفَّ كَأَنَّهَا لَمْ تُخْلَقِ<br>\
[They leave the skulls with their crowns lying<br>\
open to the sun (let alone, or say nothing of, the<br>\
hands) as though they had not been created]: (S,<br>\
Mughnee:) he says, when they cut, or cut off,<br>\
the crowns, then let alone, or say nothing of, the<br>\
hands (فَدَعِ الأَكُفَّ): i. e., they are more fit for<br>\
cutting off the hands: (TA:) Akh says that بله<br>\
is here in the place of an inf. n.; that it is as<br>\
when you say, ضَرْبَ زَيْدٍ: but الاكفّ may be in<br>\
the accus. case; so that the meaning may be<br>\
دَعِ الأَكُفَّ: (S:) the verse is thus recited in two<br>\
different ways: and also بَلْهَ الأَكُفُّ [how then<br>\
must be the case of the hands?]. (Mughnee.)<br>\
And hence the prov., تُحْرِقُكَ النَّارُ إِنْ تَرَاهَا بَلْهَ أَنْ<br>\
تَصْلَاهَا, i. e. The fire will burn thee if thou see it<br>\
from a distance: then let alone, or say nothing<br>\
of, (فَدَعْ,) thy entering into it. (TA.) A strange<br>\
instance occurs in the Saheeh of El-Bukháree,<br>\
in the explanation of the آلم of the chapter of<br>\
السَّجْدَة [the 32nd ch. of the Kur]: he says, God<br>\
says [by these three letters], أَعْدَدْتُ لِعِبَادِي<br>\
الصَّالِحِينَ مَا لَا عَيْنٌ رَأَتْ وَلَا أُذُنٌ سَمِعَتْ وَ لَا خَطَرِ<br>\
عَلَى قَلْبِ بَشَرٍ ذُخْرًا مِنْ بَلْهِ مَا اطَّلَعْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ:<br>\
(Mughnee, K: *) or ما أَطَلَعْتُهُمْ عَلَيْهِ: (so in some<br>\
copies of the K:) thus بله is used as a decl.<br>\
word, governed in the gen. case by من, and<br>\
deviating from the three meanings [explained<br>\
above]: (Mughnee, K:) but the reading commonly known is, على قلب بشر بَلْهَ مَ أَطْلَعْتُهُمْ عليه;<br>\
and this is the reading in the work of J, [the S,]<br>\
and in the Nh, and other lexicological works:<br>\
(TA:) it has been explained by غَيْر; [so that<br>\
the meaning of the sentence as first related above<br>\
is, I have prepared for my righteous servants<br>\
what eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath<br>\
it occurred to the mind of man, as a treasure<br>\
for the future, (obviously taken from Isaiah<br>\
lxiv. 4, quoted by St. Paul in 1 Cor. ii. 9,) save,<br>\
or except, that with which ye have become acquainted, or that with which I have acquainted<br>\
them; and the same, with the omission of “ as a<br>\
treasure for the future, “is the meaning of the<br>\
sentence as related in the S and Nh &amp;c.;] (Mughnee, K;) i. e. سِوَى, as in the S; (TA;) and this<br>\
corroborates, (Mughnee,) or is agreeable with,<br>\
(K,) the opinion of those who reckon بله as an<br>\
exceptive word: (Mughnee, K:) and as meaning أَجَلْ [app. a mistranscription for أَجْل; i. e.,<br>\
it has been explained also as meaning I have<br>\
done all this because of my promise to them;<br>\
(مِنْ أَجْلِ مَا أَطْلَعْتُهُمْ عَلَيْهِ because of that with<br>\
which I have acquainted them;) and thus it may<br>\
have been read by SM, for he has written اجل<br>\
without any syll. signs; and has given no other<br>\
ex. of بله in the sense here intended except one<br>\
commencing with the words, بَلْهَ انِّى لَمْ أَخُنْ<br>\
عَهْدًا, which may mean because I have not broken<br>\
a covenant, or yea, verily I have not &amp;c., accord.<br>\
as we read أَنِّى or إِنِّى]: or as meaning كُفَّ [or<br>\
rather كُفَّ عَنْ] and دَعْ [let alone, or say nothing<br>\
of; but this explanation must relate to the sentence as given in the S and Nh]: (K, but omitted<br>\
in an excellent copy of that work:) or, accord. to<br>\
El-Ahmar, it means, in this trad. [as commonly<br>\
known], كَيُفَ [how? which seems to be the<br>\
least suitable of all these explanations]. (TA.)<br>\
IAmb relates, on the authority of others, that بَلْهَ<br>\
is also syn. with عَلَى: [but I think that this is a<br>\
mistake, arising from a misunderstanding of what<br>\
here follows:] Fr says that he who makes it to<br>\
govern a gen. case regards it as used in the<br>\
manner of عَلَى, and similar particles governing<br>\
the gen. case. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَا بَلْهَكَ means مَا بَالُكَ<br>\
[What is thy state, or condition, or case?]: (K,<br>\
TA:) or مَا لَكَ [which often has this meaning:<br>\
see the letter ل]. (So in some copies of the K.)<br>\
بَلَهٌ and ↓ بَلَاهَةٌ [both properly inf. ns.; see 1;]<br>\
The attribute, or quality, denoted by the epithet<br>\
أَبْلَهٌ [q. v.]; (S, K;) i. e. heedlessness: (K:) or<br>\
heedlessness of evil; (JK in explanation of the<br>\
former, and K;) &amp;c.; (K;) and ↓ بُلَهْنِيَةٌ signifies<br>\
the same; and stupidity and languor. (JK.)<br>\
بَلَهَآءُ: see أَبْلَهُ.<br>\
بُلَهْنِيَةٌ, (K,) or بَلَهْنِيَةُ العَيْشِ, (JK,) or مِنَ العَيْشِ,<br>\
(S,) (tropical:)  An easy and a plentiful, (S, K, TA,) or a<br>\
pleasant and heedless, (JK, TA, *) state, or condition, of life: (JK, S, K, TA:) from عَيْشٌ أَبْلَهُ<br>\
[q. v.]: (Har p. 216:) the word بلهنية is rendered<br>\
quasi-coordinate to the quinqueliteral-radical class<br>\
by ا at the end, which is changed into ى because<br>\
of the kesreh before it: (S in art. بلهن:) it is<br>\
like رُفَغْنِيَةٌ and رُفَهْنِيَةٌ: IB says that it should be<br>\
mentioned in art. بله, and means عَيْشٌ أَبْلَهُ; the<br>\
ن and ى being augmentative, to render it quasicoordinate to خُبَعْثِنَةٌ: it is mentioned in the K<br>\
[and S] in arts. بلهن and بله: (TA in art.<br>\
بلهن:) the ن is augmentative accord. to Sb. (S in<br>\
the present art.) One says, لَا زِلْتَ مُلَقًّى بِتَهْنِئَةٍ<br>\
مُبَقًّى فِىبُلَهْنِيَةٍ (tropical:)  [Mayest thou not cease to be<br>\
greeted with congratulation, and made to continue<br>\
in an easy and a plentiful state of life]. (A, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also بَلَهٌ.<br>\
بَلَاهَةٌ: see بَلَهٌ.<br>\
أَبْلَهُ Heedless: (K:) or heedless of evil (K,<br>\
TA) by reason of his goodness: (TA:) or simple,<br>\
foolish, or of little sense, without discrimination:<br>\
(K:) or weak in intellect: (Msb:) accord. to<br>\
En-Nadr, (TA,) one whose evilness is dead, (K,<br>\
TA,) so that he is not cognizant of it: (TA:)<br>\
good in disposition; having little cognizance, or<br>\
understanding, of subtilties; or having little skill<br>\
therein: (K:) or one whose predominant quality<br>\
is freedom of the bosom, or heart, or mind, from<br>\
evil affections; (S, K, TA;) and good opinion of<br>\
men: (TA:) simple-hearted: (TK:) naturally<br>\
disposed to goodness, and therefore heedless of<br>\
evil, not knowing it: (T, TA:) or heedless with<br>\
respect to the present world and its people and<br>\
their corruptness and malevolence, but intelligent<br>\
and skilled in the law with respect to that which<br>\
is commanded and that which is forbidden: (Ah-<br>\
mad Ibn-Hambal, TA:) fem. بَلْهَآءُ: (S, Msb,<br>\
K: *) pl. بُلْهٌ: (S, Msb:) and ↓ بُلَهَآءُ, a pl., [as<br>\
though the sing. were بَلِيهٌ,] signifies dull, stupid,<br>\
or wanting in intelligence: but this is post-classical.<br>\
(TA.) Hence, شَابٌّ أَبْلَهُ [A youth, or young man,<br>\
who is heedless, &amp;c.], because of his inexperience<br>\
in affairs: the epithet is applied to a youth in like<br>\
manner as freedom from care, or thought, and<br>\
like as insanity, are attributed to him. (S.) And<br>\
خَيْرُ أَوْلَادِنَا الأَبْلَهُ العَقُولُ (tropical:)  [The best of our children<br>\
is the heedless, &amp;c., that has much intelligence];<br>\
(S, Msb;) a saying of Ez-Zibrikán Ibn-Bedr;<br>\
(S;) meaning such as, by reason of his bashfulness, is like the ابله, (S, Msb,) so that he feigns<br>\
heedlessness, and passes over things, (Msb,) though<br>\
he has much intelligence; (S;) or such as is<br>\
thought to be stupid, but, when examined, is<br>\
found to be [very] intelligent. (IAth, TA in art.<br>\
عقل.) And أَكْثَرُ أَهْلِ الجَنَّةِ البُلْهُ, a trad., meaning Most of the people of Paradise are the بُلْه<br>\
[or heedless, &amp;c.,] with respect to the present<br>\
world, because of their being little concerned<br>\
thereby, while they are intelligent with respect to<br>\
the world to come; (S;) or they are thus termed<br>\
because they are heedless of their affairs in the<br>\
present world, and unskilful in the management<br>\
thereof, and busy themselves with their affairs<br>\
relating to the world to come. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بَلْهَآءُ,<br>\
applied to a woman, Generous, strong-hearted,<br>\
(مَزِيرَةٌ, for المَرِيرَةُ in the copies of the K is a<br>\
mistake for المَزِيرَةُ, with زاى, TA, [app. here<br>\
meaning bold,]) inexperienced in affairs, and<br>\
simple, or unintelligent. (K, * TA.) ISh cites a<br>\
poet as applying this epithet to a young girl with<br>\
whom he had sported, and who acquainted him<br>\
with her secrets, by reason of her inexperience,<br>\
and want of cunning, not knowing what that<br>\
implied against her. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, applied to a<br>\
she-camel, (tropical:)  That does not take fright, and flee<br>\
from a thing, (ISh, A, K,) by reason of staidness,<br>\
(ISh, K,) or heaviness, (A,) as though she were<br>\
stupid. (ISh, A, K.) One does not say جَمَلٌ أَبْلَهُ.<br>\
(ISh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  شَبَابٌ أَبْلَهُ (tropical:)  Soft, or delicate, youth;<br>\
(T, A, K;) as though he who enjoys it were<br>\
heedless of nocturnal accidents or calamities. (A,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And عَيْشٌ أَبْلَهُ (tropical:)  A soft, or delicate, or<br>\
pleasant, or plentiful and easy, life: (K, TA:)<br>\
or a life in which are few anxieties: (CK:) or a<br>\
life in which are few griefs, or sorrows. (S.)<br>\
