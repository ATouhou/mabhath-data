بَاضَهُ, (S, K,) first pers. بِضْتُ, (M,) aor.<br>\
يَبِيضُ, for which one should not say يَبُوضُ, [though<br>\
it would be agreeable with a general rule respecting verbs denoting surpassingness,] (S, O,) He<br>\
surpassed him in whiteness. (S, M, O, K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
بَاضَتْ, (S, M, Msb, K, except that in the M and<br>\
Msb we find the masc. form, بَاضَ, followed by<br>\
الطَّائِرُ,) aor. تَبِيضُ, (Msb,) inf. n. بَيْضٌ, (M,<br>\
Msb,) said of an ostrich, (M,) or a hen, (K,) or<br>\
any bird, (S, M, Msb,) and the like, (Msb,) She<br>\
laid her eggs, (M, Msb, TA,) or egg. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
بَاضَ السَّحَابُ (tropical:)  The clouds rained. (IAar, O, K.)<br>\
A poet says, [using a phrase from which this<br>\
application of the verb probably originated,]<br>\
بَاضَ النَّعَامُ بِهِ فَنَفَّرَ أَهْلَهُ<br>\
إِلَّا المُقِيمَ عَلَى الدَّوَى المُتَأَفِّنِ<br>\
(IAar,) i. e. (tropical:)  The نعام, meaning the نَعَائِم, [or<br>\
Twentieth Mansion of the Moon,] sent down rain<br>\
upon it, and so put to flight its occupants, except<br>\
him who remained incurring the risk of dying<br>\
from disease, wasting away: [the last word being<br>\
in the gen. case, by poetic license, because the<br>\
next before it is in that case; like خَرِبٍ in the<br>\
phrase هٰذَا جُحْرُ ضَبٍّ خَرِبٍ:] the poet is describing a valley rained upon and in consequence producing herbage; for the rain of the asterism<br>\
called النعائم is in the hot season, [when that<br>\
asterism sets aurorally, (see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art.<br>\
نزل,)] whereupon there grows, at the roots of<br>\
the حَلِىّ, a plant called نَشْر, which is poisonous,<br>\
killing beasts that eat of it: the verse is explained<br>\
as above by El-Mohellebee: (IB:) or, as IAar<br>\
says, the poet means rain that falls at the نَوْء [by<br>\
which we are here to understand the setting<br>\
aurorally] of النعائم; and that when this rain falls,<br>\
the wise flees and the stupid remains. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
بَاضَ بِالمَكَانِ (tropical:)  He remained, stayed, or abode, in<br>\
the place [like as a bird does in the place where<br>\
she lays her eggs]. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  بَاضَتِ الأَرْضُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The earth produced كَمْأَة [or truffles, which<br>\
are thus likened to eggs]: (A, TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  the<br>\
earth produced the plants that it contained: or<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  it became changed in its greenness to yellowness,<br>\
and scattered the fruit, or produce, and dried up.<br>\
(M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  بَاضَ الحَرُّ (tropical:)  The heat became vehement, or intense. (S, A, K.)<br>\

بيّض, (S, M, K,) inf. n. تَبْيِضٌ, (S,) He<br>\
whitened a thing; made it white; (S, M;) contr.<br>\
of سَوَّدَ. (K.) He bleached clothes. (M.) [He<br>\
whitewashed a wall &amp;c. He tinned a copper<br>\
vessel or the like.] You say, بَيَّضَ اللّٰهُ وَجْهَهُ [lit.,<br>\
God whitened his face: or may God whiten his<br>\
face: meaning (tropical:)  God rendered his face expressive of joy, or cheerfulness; or rejoiced, or cheered,<br>\
him: or may God &amp;c.: and also God cleared<br>\
his character; or manifested his honesty, or the<br>\
like: or may God &amp;c.: see the contr. سَوَّدَ].<br>\
(TA.) And بيّض لَهُ [He left a blank space for it;<br>\
namely, a word or sentence or the like: probably<br>\
post-classical]. (TA in art. شمس; &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [He<br>\
wrote out fairly, after having made a first rough<br>\
draught: in this sense, also, opposed to سَوَّدَ: probably post-classical.] ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  He filled a vessel: (M,<br>\
A, K: *) or he filled a vessel, and a skin, with<br>\
water and milk. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  He emptied<br>\
(A, K) a vessel: (A:) thus it bears two contr.<br>\
significations. (K.)<br>\

بايضهُ, (S, M,) inf. n. مُبَايَضَةٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
contended with him for superiority in whiteness.<br>\

بَيْضٌ: see بَيْضَةٌ, in three places.<br>\
بَيْضَةٌ An egg (Msb) of an ostrich, (Mgh,) and<br>\
of any bird, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and the like, i. e.<br>\
of anything that is termed صَمُوخٌ [or having<br>\
merely an ear-hole] as distinguished from such as<br>\
is termed أَذُونٌ [or having an ear that is called<br>\
أُذُنٌ]: so called because of its whiteness: (TA:)<br>\
n. un. of ↓ بَيْضٌ: (S, M, * Msb, K:) pl. [of the<br>\
former] بَيْضَاتٌ (M, Sgh, K) and بَيَضَاتٌ, which<br>\
latter is irreg., (M, Sgh,) and only used by poetic<br>\
license; (Sgh;) and (of بَيْضٌ, M) بُيُوضٌ. (M,<br>\
K.) You say, أَفْرَخَتِ البَيْضَةُ The egg had in it<br>\
a young bird. (ISh.) And أَفْرَخَ بَيْضَةُ القَوْمِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  What was hidden, of the affair, or case, of the<br>\
people, or company of men, became apparent.<br>\
(ISh.) [See also art. فرخ.] بَيْضَةُ البَلَدِ signifies<br>\
The egg which the ostrich abandons. (S, M, K.)<br>\
And hence the saying, هُوَ أَذَلُّ مِنْ بَيْضَةِ البَلَدِ<br>\
(tropical:)  He is more abject, or vile, than the egg of the<br>\
ostrich which it abandons (S, A, * K) in the desert.<br>\
(TA.) You say also, هُوَ بَيْضَةُ البَلَدِ in dispraise<br>\
and in praise. (IAar, Aboo-Bekr, M.) When<br>\
said in dispraise, it means (tropical:)  He is like the egg of<br>\
the ostrich from which the young bird has come<br>\
forth, and which the male ostrich has cast away,<br>\
so that men and camels tread upon it: (IAar,<br>\
M:) or he is alone, without any to aid him;<br>\
like the egg from which the male ostrich has<br>\
arisen, and which he has abandoned as useless:<br>\
(TA:) or he is an obscure man, or one of no<br>\
reputation, whose lineage is unknown. (Ham<br>\
p. 250.) And when said in praise, it means (tropical:)  He<br>\
is like the ostrich&#39;s egg in which is the young<br>\
bird; because the male ostrich in that case protects it: (IAar, M:) or he is unequalled in<br>\
nobility; like the egg that is left alone: (M:)<br>\
or he is a lord, or chief: (IAar, M:) or he is the<br>\
unequalled of the بَلَد [or country or the like],<br>\
to whom others resort, and whose words they<br>\
accept: (K:) or he is a celebrated, or wellknown, person. (Ham p. 250.) [See also art.<br>\
بلد. And for another meaning of بَيْضَةُ البَلَدِ see<br>\
below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  A helmet of iron, (AO, S, * M, * Mgh, *<br>\
K, *) which is composed of plates like the bones<br>\
of the skull, the edges whereof are joined together<br>\
by nails; and sometimes of one piece: (AO:) so<br>\
called because resembling in shape the egg of an<br>\
ostrich: (AO, M, Mgh: *) in this sense, also,<br>\
n. un. of ↓ بَيْضٌ. (S, K: [in the CK, for والحَدِيدُ<br>\
we should read والحَدِيدِ.]) This may be meant<br>\
in a trad. in which it is said that a man&#39;s hand<br>\
is to be cut off for his stealing a بَيْضَة. (Mgh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  A testicle: (S, K:) pl. بِيضَانٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\

Et-Táïf, white and large. (M.) ―<br>\
-b7-  (tropical:)  The core<br>\
of a boil: as resembling an egg. (M.) ―<br>\
-b8-  (tropical:)  The<br>\
fat of a camel&#39;s hump: for the same reason.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b9-  بَيْضَةُ البَلَدِ, in addition to its meanings<br>\
mentioned above, also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The white truffle:<br>\
(O, K:) or simply truffles; syn. الكَمْأَةُ; (TA;)<br>\
or these are called الأَرْضِ ↓ بَيْضُ. (A.) ―<br>\
-b10-  بَيْضَةٌ<br>\
also signifies (tropical:)  The continent, or container, or<br>\
receptacle, (حَوْزَة,) of anything. (S, K, TA.) And<br>\
[hence] بَيْضَةُ الإِسْلَامِ (tropical:)  The place [or territory]<br>\
which comprises El-Islám [meaning the Muslims];<br>\
like as the egg comprises the young bird: (Mgh:)<br>\
or this signifies the congregation, or collective<br>\
body, of the Muslims. (AZ, M.) And بَيْضَةُ القَوْمِ<br>\
(tropical:)  The quarter, tract, region, or district, of the<br>\
people, or company of men: (S, K:) the heart;<br>\
or midst, or main part, of the abode thereof:<br>\
(S, TA:) the principal place of abode (أَصْل)<br>\
thereof; (M, TA;) the place that comprises them;<br>\
the place of their government, or regal dominion;<br>\
and the seat of their دعوة [i. e. دِعْوَة or kindred and<br>\
brotherhood]: (TA:) the midst of them: (M:)<br>\
or, as some say, their [kinsfolk such as are termed]<br>\
عَشِيرَة: (TA:) but when you say, أَتَاهُمُ العَدُوُّ فِى<br>\
بَيْضَتِهِمْ, the meaning is [the enemy came to them<br>\
in] their principal place of abode (أَصْل), and the<br>\
place where they were congregated. (TA.) And<br>\
بَيْضَةُ الدَّارِ (tropical:)  The midst of the country or place of<br>\
abode or the like: (AZ, M, TA:) the main part<br>\
thereof. (TA.) And بَيْضَةُ المُلْكِ i. q. حَوْزَتُهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [The seat of regal power: or the heart, or<br>\
principal part, of the kingdom]. (S and K in<br>\
art. حوز.) ―<br>\
-b11-  بَيْضَةُ الخِدْرِ (M, A, K) (tropical:)  The damsel<br>\
(M, K) of the خدر [or curtain &amp;c.]: (K: [in<br>\
the CK, جَارِيَتُهَا is erroneously put for جَارِيَتُهُ:])<br>\
because she is kept concealed within it. (TA.)<br>\
You say also, هِىَ مِنْ بَيْضَاتِ الحِجَالِ (tropical:)  [She is<br>\
of the damsels of the curtained bridal canopies].<br>\
(A, TA.) بَيْضَةٌ is used by a metonymy to signify<br>\
(tropical:)  A woman, by way of likening her thereto [i. e.<br>\
to an egg] in colour, and in respect of her being<br>\
protected as beneath the wing. (B.) [See Kur<br>\
xxxvii. 47.] ―<br>\
-b12-  بَيْضَةٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  White land,<br>\
in which is no herbage; opposed to سَوْدَةٌ: (TA:)<br>\
and ↓ بِيضَةٌ, with kesr, white, smooth land; (K;)<br>\
thus accord. to IAar, with kesr to the ب: (Sh:)<br>\
and ↓ أَرْضٌ بَيْضَآءُ signifies smooth land, in which is<br>\
no herbage; as though herbage blackened land:<br>\
or untrodden land: as also بَيْضَةٌ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b13-  بَيْضَةُ<br>\
النَّهَارِ The whiteness of day; [daylight;] i. q.<br>\
↓ بَيَاضُهُ; (K;) i. e. its light. (Har p. 222.) You<br>\
say, أَتَيْتُهُ فِى بَيْضَةِ النَّهَارِ I came to him in the<br>\
whiteness of day. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b14-  بَيْضَةُ الحِرِّ (assumed tropical:)  The vehemence, or intenseness, of heat. (M.) And بَيْضَةُ<br>\
القَيْظِ (tropical:)  The most vehement, or intense, heat of<br>\
summer, or of the hottest period of summer, from<br>\
the [auroral] rising of الدَّبَرَان to that of سُهَيْل;<br>\
[i. e., reckoning for the commencement of the<br>\
era of the Flight, in central Arabia, from about<br>\
the 26th of May to about the 4th of August,<br>\
O. S.;] (A, * TA;) as also القَيْظِ ↓ بَيْضَآءُ. (A,<br>\
TA.) And بَيْضَةُ الصَّيْفِ (assumed tropical:)  The main part of the<br>\
صيف [or summer]: (M, TA:) or the vehement,<br>\
or intense, heat thereof. (Ham p. 250.)<br>\
بَيضَةٌ: see بَيْضَةٌ, in the latter part of the paragraph.<br>\
بَيَاضٌ Whiteness; contr. of سَوَادٌ; in an animal,<br>\
and in a plant, and in other things; and, accord.<br>\
to IAar, in water also; (M;) the colour of that<br>\
which is termed أَبْيَضُ: (S, Msb, * K:) they said<br>\
بَيَاضٌ and ↓ بَيَاضَةٌ, (S, M, K,) like as they said<br>\
مَنْزِلٌ and مَنْزِلَةٌ: (S:) بَيَاضَةٌ being applied to a<br>\
whiteness in the eye. (M.) You say, هٰذَا أَشَدُّ<br>\
بَيَاضًا مِنْ كَذَا [This is whiter than such a thing]:<br>\
(S, K: *) but not ↓ أَبْيَضُ منْهُ: (S:) the latter is<br>\
anomalous; (K;) [like أَسْوَدُ مِنْهُ; q. v.;] but it<br>\
was said by the people of El-Koofeh, (S, K,) who<br>\
adduced as authority the saying of the rájiz,<br>\
جَارِيَةٌ فِى دِرْعِهَا الفَضْفَاضِ<br>\
أَبْيَضُ مِنْ أُخْتِ بَنِى إِبَاضِ<br>\
[A damsel in her ample shift, whiter than the<br>\
sister of the tribe of Benoo-Ibád]: Mbr, however, says that an anomalous verse is no evidence<br>\
against a rule commonly approved: and as to the<br>\
saying of another,<br>\
إِذَا الرِّجَالُ شَتَوْا وَاشْتَدَّ أَكْلُهُمُ<br>\
فَأَنْتَ أَبْيَضُهُمْ سِرْبَالَ طَبَّاخِ<br>\
[When men experience dearth in winter, and their<br>\
eating becomes vehement, thou art the whitest of<br>\
them, or rather the white of them, in respect of<br>\
cook&#39;s clothing, having little or nothing to do with<br>\
entertaining them], the word in question may be<br>\
considered as an epithet of the measure أَفْعَلُ that is<br>\
followed by مِنْ to denote excess: but it is only<br>\
like the instances in the sayings هُوَ أَحْسَنُهُمْ وَجْهًا<br>\
and أَكْرَمُهُمْ أَبًا, meaning حَسَنُهُمْ وَجْهًا and كَرِيِمُهُمْ<br>\
أَبًا; so it is as though he said فَأَنْتَ مُبْيَضُّهُمْ سِرْبَالًا;<br>\
and as he has prefixed it to a complement which<br>\
it governs in the gen. case, what follows is in the<br>\
accus. case as a specificative. (S.) This latter<br>\
verse is by Tarafeh, who satirizes therein &#39;Amr<br>\
Ibn-Hind; and is also differently related in respect<br>\
of the first hemistich, and the first word of the<br>\
second. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بَيَاضُ النَّهَارِ: see 3; and see<br>\
بَيْضَةٌ, near the end of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b3-  بَيَاضٌ is<br>\
also used elliptically for ذُو بَيَاضٍ; and thus means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  White clothing; as in the saying, فُلَانٌ يَلْبَسُ<br>\
السَّوَادَ وَالبَيَاضَ Such a one wears black and white<br>\
clothing. (Mgh.) [Hence, also, it has other significations, here following.] ―<br>\
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  Milk. (K.) See<br>\
an ex., voce سَوَادٌ. ―<br>\
-b5-  [(assumed tropical:)  The white of an egg.] ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
بَيَاضُ الأَرْضِ (assumed tropical:)  That part of land wherein is no<br>\
cultivation nor population and the like. (M.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
بَيَاضُ الجِلْدِ (assumed tropical:)  That part of the skin upon which<br>\
is no hair. (M.) ―<br>\
-b8-  (tropical:)  بَيَاضٌ also signifies (tropical:)  A<br>\
man&#39;s person; like سَوَادٌ; syn. شَخْصٌ; as in the<br>\
saying, لَا يُزَايِلُ سَوَادِى بَيَاضَكَ (tropical:)  My person will<br>\
not separate itself from thy person. (As, A, TA.)<br>\
بَيُوضٌ A hen that lays many eggs; (S, M, A, *<br>\
K; *) as also ↓ بَيَّاضَةٌ: (M:) [but in the Msb it<br>\
is evidently used as signifying simply oviparous:]<br>\
pl. (of the former, S, M *) بُيُضٌ (S, M, A, K) and<br>\
بِيضٌ, (S, M, K,) the latter in the dial. of those<br>\
who say رُسْلٌ for رُسُلٌ, the ب being with kesr in<br>\
order that the ى may remain unchanged; (S,<br>\
M;) but sometimes they said بُوضٌ. (M.)<br>\
بَيَاضَةٌ: see بَيَاضٌ.<br>\
بَائِضٌ A hen, (Az, K,) or bird, (S, Msb,) and<br>\
the like, (Msb,) laying an egg or eggs: (Az, S, *<br>\
Msb, K: *) without ة because the cock does not<br>\
lay eggs: (Az, TA:) or it is applied also to a<br>\
cock, (M, TA,) and to a crow, (M, A, TA,) [as<br>\
meaning begetting an egg or eggs,] in like manner<br>\
as one uses the word وَالِدٌ. (M, TA.)<br>\
بَيَّاضٌ A bleacher of clothes; as a kind of rel. n.;<br>\
not as a verbal epithet; for were it this, it would<br>\
be مُبَيِّضٌ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A seller of eggs. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
بَيَّاضَةٌ: see بَيُوضٌ.<br>\
أَبْيَضُ White; contr. of أَسْوَدُ; (A, K;) having<br>\
whiteness: (Msb:) fem. بَيْضَآءُ: (Msb:) pl. بِيضٌ,<br>\
originally بُيْضٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the damm being<br>\
converted into kesr in order that the ى may<br>\
remain unchanged, (S, K,) [i. e.] to suit the ى.<br>\
(Msb.) In the phrase أَعْطِنِى أَبْيَضَّهْ, mentioned<br>\
by Sb, as used by some of the Arabs, meaning<br>\
أَبْيَضَ, [i. e. Give thou to me a white one,] ه is<br>\
subjoined as it is in هُنَّهْ for هُنَّ, and the ض is<br>\
doubled because the letter of declinability cannot<br>\
have ه subjoined to it; wherefore the letter of<br>\
declinability is the first ض, and the second is the<br>\
augmentative, and for this reason it has subjoined<br>\
to it the ه whereof the purpose is to render plainly<br>\
perceivable the vowel [which is necessarily added<br>\
after the doubled ض]: Aboo-&#39;Alee says, [app. of<br>\
the ه,] that it should properly have neither fet-h<br>\
nor any vowel. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to a man &amp;c.,<br>\
it was sometimes used to signify White in complexion: but in this sense they generally used the<br>\
epithet أَحْمَرُ. (IAth, TA in art. حمر.) They also<br>\
said, فُلَانٌ أَبْيَضُ الوَجْهِ and فُلَانَةُ بَيْضَآءُ الوَجْهِ,<br>\
meaning Such a man, and such a woman, is clear,<br>\
in face, from freckles or the like, and unseemly<br>\
blackness. (Az, TA.) And they used بِيضَانٌ, (S,<br>\
K,) a pl. of أَبْيَضُ, (TA,) in the contr. of the sense<br>\
of سُودَانٌ, (S, K,) [i. e. as signifying Whites,]<br>\
applied to men: (S:) though they applied the<br>\
appellation أَبُو البَيْضَآءِ to the Abyssinian: (TA in<br>\
art. عور:) or to the negro: and أَبُو الجَوْنِ to the<br>\
white man. (ISk.) But accord. to Th, أَبْيَضُ<br>\
applied to a man signifies only (tropical:)  Pure; free from<br>\
faults: (IAth, TA in art. حمر:) or, so applied,<br>\
unsullied in honour, nobility, or estimation; (Az,<br>\
K;) free from faults; and generous: and so<br>\
بَيْضَآءُ applied to a woman. (Az.) [In the lexicons,<br>\
however, (see, for ex., among countless other<br>\
instances, an explanation of بَضَّةٌ in the S,) and in<br>\
other post-classical works, it is generally used,<br>\
when thus applied, in its proper sense, of White;<br>\
or fair in complexion.] ―<br>\
-b3-  كَتِيبَةٌ بَيْضَآءُ An army,<br>\
or a portion thereof, upon which the whiteness of<br>\
the [arms or armour of] iron is apparent. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And بَيْضَآءُ alone, [as a subst.,] A piece of<br>\

the former is the correct explanation: (MF, TA:)<br>\
you should not say الأَيَّامُ البِيضُ: (Ibn-El-Jawá-<br>\

and the author of the K has himself explained<br>\
الأَوَاضِحُ by الأَيَّامُ البِيضُ. (TA.) ―<br>\

-b27-  بَيْضَآءُ also signifies<br>\
