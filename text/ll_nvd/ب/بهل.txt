بَهَلَ النَّاقَةَ, [aor.<br>\
بَهَلَ, inf. n. بَهْلٌ,] He left the<br>\
she-camel without a صِرَار [bound upon her udder<br>\
to prevent her being sucked]; (Bd in iii. 54;) as<br>\
also ↓ ابلها: (S:) or he left her to be milked;<br>\
or allowed her being milked: (Z, TA:) and ↓ the<br>\
latter, he loosed her صِرَار, and left her young one<br>\
at liberty to such her; (K;) and he left her to<br>\
herself (K, TA) to be milked by any one who<br>\
pleased. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And بَهَلَهُ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
بَهَلَ, (K,)<br>\
[inf. n. بَهْلٌ,] He left him (S, K) to his own will,<br>\
or wish, (S,) or to his own opinion, or judgment;<br>\
(K;) as also ↓ ابهلهُ: (S, K:) or the former is<br>\
said in relation to the free man; and ↓ the latter,<br>\
in relation to the slave; (Zj, K;) and signifies<br>\
also [simply] he left him to himself. (K, * TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Hence, (TA,) بَهْلٌ signifies [also] The act of<br>\
cursing. (S, Msb, K.) You say, بَهَلَهُ, aor.<br>\
بَهَلَ, inf. n.<br>\
بَهْلٌ, He cursed him. (Msb.) And بَهَلَ اللّٰهُ فُلَانًا<br>\
May God curse such a one! (K, TA.)<br>\

مُبَاهَلَةٌ The act of cursing each other: (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb:) inf. n. of باهلهُ He cursed him,<br>\
being cursed by him: (Msb:) [or rather] بَاهَلْتُهُ<br>\
signifies I joined with him in imprecating the<br>\
curse of God upon whichever of us did wrong.<br>\
(JK.) Hence the saying of Ibn-Mes&#39;ood, مَنْ شَآءَ<br>\
بَاهَلْتُهُ أَنَّ سُورَةَ القُصْرَى نَزَلَتْ بَعْدَ البَقَرَةِ<br>\
[Whosoever will, I will contend with him by imprecating the curse of God upon whichever of us is<br>\
wrong, that the shorter chapter of “Women” came<br>\
down from heaven after the chapter of “The<br>\
Cow”]: or, accord. to one recital, he said لَا عَنْتُهُ:<br>\
for when they differed respecting a thing, they<br>\
used to come together, and say, اللّٰهِ عَلَى ↓ بَهْلَةُ<br>\
الظَّالِمِ مِنَّا [The curse of God be upon such of us<br>\
as is the wrongdoer!]. (Mgh.) باهل بَعْضُهُمْ<br>\
بَعْضًا and ↓ تبّهلوا and ↓ تباهلوا all signify They<br>\
cursed one another: (K:) [or] they joined in<br>\
imprecating a curse upon such of them as was<br>\
the wrongdoer: (TA:) and ↓ ابتهلوا signifies the<br>\
like: whence, ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ, in the Kur [iii. 54],<br>\
(Bd, TA,) as some explain it, (TA,) meaning<br>\
↓ ثُمَّ نَتَبَاهَلْ, i. e., Then let us imprecate a curse<br>\
upon such of us as is the liar. (Bd. [But see<br>\
also 8 below.])<br>\

أَبْهَلَ see 1, in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [The inf. n.] إِبْهَالٌ<br>\
also signifies The sending forth, or letting flow,<br>\
the water upon what has been sown, (JK, K, TA,)<br>\
after having finished the sowing. (JK, TA. [In<br>\

called, i. e., persons who join in imprecating a<br>\
curse upon such of them as is the wrongdoer].<br>\
(TA.) It is said that ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ, in the Kur [iii. 54,<br>\
of which one explanation has been given above,<br>\
(see 3,)] means (tropical:)  Then let us be sincere, or without hypocrisy, in prayer, or supplication; (S,<br>\
TA;) and let us strive, or be earnest, or energetic:<br>\
(TA:) or let us humble, or abase, ourselves; &amp;c.;<br>\

(S, K. [In the CK the latter is written مُبَاهِلٌ, as<br>\

أَبْهَلٌ The produce, or fruit, of a certain tree,<br>\

[Avicenna] in the Kánoon; and he adds that it<br>\
is of two species, small and great, both brought<br>\
from the country of the رُوم: one species of the<br>\
tree thereof has leaves like those of the سَرْو [or<br>\
common, evergreen, cypress], has many thorns,<br>\
and grows, or spreads, wide, (يَسْتَعْرِضُ,) not<br>\
growing tall: the leaves of the other are like those<br>\
of the طَرْفَآء [or tamarisk], the taste thereof is like<br>\
[that of] the سَرْو, and it is drier, and less hot:<br>\
(TA:) or it is the produce of a kind of great<br>\
tree, the leaves of which are like [those of] the<br>\
طرفاء, and the fruit of which is like the نَبِق [or<br>\
fruit of the lote-tree called سِدْر]; and it is not<br>\
[the fruit of] the عرعر, as J imagined it to be:<br>\
the smoke thereof expels quickly the young in the<br>\
womb: used as a liniment, with vinegar, it cures<br>\
what is termed دَآء الثَّعْلَب [alopecia]: and with<br>\
honey, it cleanses foul ulcers. (K.) [In the present day, it is applied to the juniper-tree; as is<br>\
also عَرْعَر; and particularly to the species thereof<br>\
called the savin. See قَطِرَانٌ.]<br>\
