بَلُقَ, (MSb, TA,) inf. n. بَلْقٌ, (TA,) He opened<br>\
a door wholly: (JK, S, K:) or opened it vehemently: (K:) and ↓ ابلق signifies the same. (JK,<br>\
S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,] He devirginated, or defloured, a girl. (AA, K.)<br>\
-A3-  Also He shut, or<br>\
closed, a door. (IF, K.) Thus it bears two contr.<br>\
significations. (K.)<br>\

ابلق He (a stallion) begot offspring such as<br>\
are termed بُلْق [pl. of أَبْلَقُ, q. v.]. (Zj, K.)<br>\

to the CK بَلقٌ, but this is a mistake;]) and ↓ بَلُقَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
بَلُقَ; (K;) but IDrd asserts only the first and<br>\
second of these verbs to be known; (TA;) He<br>\
(a horse) was, or became, ابلق, i. e., black and<br>\
white: (S, K:) or white in the kind legs as high<br>\
as the thighs. (K.)<br>\

بَلِقَ, (K, * TA,) Blackness and whiteness [together,<br>\
generally in horses]: (S, K:) or the extension of<br>\

which white is mixed. (Golius on the authority<br>\
of Meyd.)<br>\
بُلْقَةٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
بُلَيقٌ a contracted dim. of أَبْلَقُ. (TA.)<br>\
بَلُّوقٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
بَلُّوقَةٌ, (JK, S, &amp;c.,) [said to be] like عَجُوزَةٌ,<br>\
(K,) [but this is wrong, and is probably a mistranscription, for عَجُّورَة, with teshdeed and the<br>\
unpointed ر, n. un. of عَجُّور,] and with damm,<br>\
[↓ بُلُّوقَةٌ,] (IDrd, K,) both mentioned by AA,<br>\
(TA,) but more commonly with fet-h [to the بِ],<br>\
(IDrd, TA,) A [desert such as is termed] مَفَازَة:<br>\
(AA, S, K:) or a tract of sand that gives growth<br>\
to nothing except the [plant or tree called] رُخَامَى,<br>\
(As, K, * TA,) of which the [wild] bulls are fond,<br>\
and the roots of which they dig up and eat:<br>\
(TA:) or a wide tract of fertile land in which no<br>\
one shares with thee: (Fr, TA:) or a hard place<br>\
among sands, as though it were swept, asserted<br>\
by the Arabs of the desert to be of the dwellingplaces of the Jinn: (Aboo-Kheyreh, TA:) or<br>\
a desert land, destitute of vegetable produce and<br>\
of water, or of human beings, inhabited by none<br>\
but Jinn: (TA:) or a level, soft land: (K:) or<br>\
a place in which no trees grow: (JK:) or white<br>\
places in sand, which give growth to nothing:<br>\
(ISh, TA in art. برص:) or a piece of ground<br>\
differing in colour or appearance from that which<br>\
is next to it, that produces nothing whatever: as<br>\
also ↓ بَلُّوقٌ, like تَنُّورٌ: and, with the art. ال, particularly applied to a place in the district of ElBahreyn, asserted (as IDrd says, TA) to be of<br>\
the dwelling-places of the Jinn: (K:) pl. بَلَالِيقُ;<br>\
(JK, S, K;) which is syn. with مَوَامٍ (A &#39;Obeyd, S)<br>\
and سَبَارِيتٌ, meaning lands wherein is nothing:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, TA:) in poetry, بَلَالِقُ occurs as its pl.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
بُلُّوقَةٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
أَبْلَقُ, applied to a horse, fem. بَلْقَآءُ, Black and<br>\
white: (S, K:) or white in the hind legs as high<br>\
as the thighs: (ISd, K:) pl. بُلْقٌ: which is applied by Ru-beh to mountains: but the Arabs<br>\
apply the epithet ابلق to a beast of the equine<br>\
kind, and أَبْرَقُ to a mountain (TA) and to a<br>\
sheep or goat: (Lh, TA in art. برق:) the former<br>\
is also applied to a rope. (JK.) طَلَبَ الأَبْلَقَ<br>\
العَقُوقَ (which is a prov., TA) means He sought<br>\
an impossible thing; because ابلق is applied to<br>\
a male, and عقوق means pregnant: or الابلق<br>\
العقوق means the dawn; because it breaks, (lit.,<br>\
cleaves,) from عَقَّهُ signifying شَقَّهُ. (K.)<br>\
