بَغُضَ; (S, A, Msb, K;) and بَغَضَ; aor. [of<br>\
both]<br>\
بَغُضَ; and بَغِضَ, aor.<br>\
بَغَضَ; (K;) inf. n. بَفَاضَةٌ,<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. of the first; (TA;) He,<br>\
or it, (a man, S, or a thing, Msb,) was, or<br>\
became, hateful, odious, or an object of hatred.<br>\
(S, A, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بَغُضَ جَدُّهُ (tropical:)  His fortune, or good<br>\
fortune, fell; syn. عَثَرَ. (A.) And بَغُضَ جَدُّكَ,<br>\
(L, K, TA,) or بَغَضَ, (as in one copy of the K,)<br>\
or بَغِضَ, (as in the CK,) (tropical:)  May thy fortune, or<br>\
good fortune, fall: syn. تَعَسَ, (K, TA,) and عَثَرَ:<br>\
(TA:) a phrase ascribed by IB to the people of<br>\
El-Yemen. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 4, in three places.<br>\
2<br>\
بغّضهُ اللّٰهُ إِلَى النَّاسِ, (S, TA,) or لِلنَّاسِ, (Msb,)<br>\
[but this I think doubtful, from what is said in<br>\
explanation of the verb of wonder, (see 4,)] inf. n.<br>\
تَبْغِيضٌ, (S, K,) God rendered him hateful, odious,<br>\
or an object of hatred, to men; (S, Msb; *)<br>\
تَبْغِيضٌ being the contr. of تَحْبِيبٌ: (K:) or<br>\
very hateful or odious. (TA.) You say also,<br>\
حُبِّبَ إِلَىَّ زَيْدٌ وَ بُغِّضَ إِلَىَّ عَمْرٌو [Zeyd was rendered an object of love to me, and &#39;Amr was<br>\
rendered an object of hatred, or of much hatred,<br>\
to me]. (A, TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
بَاغَضْتُهُ, inf. n. مُبَاغَضَةٌ, I rendered him<br>\
[hatred, or] vehement hatred, reciprocally. (A, *<br>\
TA.) You say also, بَيْنَهُمَا مُبَاغَضَةٌ [Between them<br>\
two is reciprocal hatred, or vehement hatred].<br>\
(A.)<br>\
4<br>\
ابغضهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِبْغَاضٌ, (Msb,)<br>\
He hated him. (S, A, * Msb, * K.) It is said that<br>\
↓ بَغَضَهُ is not allowable: (Msb:) or يَبْغُضُنِى is a<br>\
bad form; (AHát, K;) used by the lower class;<br>\
and sanctioned by Th only; for he explains قَالِينَ,<br>\
as occurring in the Kur [xxvi. 168], by بَاغِضِينَ,<br>\
which shows that he held بَغَضَ to be a dial. var.;<br>\
for otherwise he would have said مُبْغِضِينَ: (AHát:)<br>\
but the epithet بَغُوضٌ affords a strong evidence in<br>\
favour of the opinion of Th here mentioned; for<br>\
فَعُولٌ is mostly from فَاعِلٌ, not from مُفْعِلٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  مَا أَبْغَضَهُ إِلَىَّ, (S,) or لِى, (K,) is [said to be]<br>\
anomalous; (S, K;) because the verb of wonder<br>\
is not regularly formed from a verb of the measure<br>\
أَفْعَلَ; but this is not anomalous; for it is from<br>\
بَغَضَ فُلَانٌ إِلَىَّ [“ such a one was, or became,<br>\
hateful, or odious, to me: ” ما ابغضه الىّ signifying How hateful, or odious, is he to me! but<br>\
ما ابغضه لِى, How he hates me! for] the lexicologists and grammarians relate that مَا أَبْغَضَنِى لَهُ<br>\
is said when thou hatest him; and ما ابغضنى إِلَيْهِ,<br>\
when he hates thee: (IB:) ISd says, on the<br>\
authority of Sb, that ما ابغضنى له means that<br>\
thou art an object of hatred (مُبْغَضٌ [so in the<br>\
TA, but this is evidently a mistake for مُبْغِضٌ, a<br>\
hater,]) to him; and ما ابغضه الىّ, that he is an<br>\
object of hatred with thee, or in thine estimation.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  أَنْعَمَ اللّٰهُ بِكَ عَيْنًا وَ أَبْغَضَ بِعَدُوِّكَ عَيْنًا, (so<br>\
in the A, and the latter verb thus in the JK and<br>\
in the L,) or the former verb is نَعِمَ, (L, K,) and<br>\
the latter ↓ بَغَضَ, (K, TA,) like نَصَرَ, (TA,) or<br>\
↓ بَغِضَ, (CK,) is a form of imprecation (TA)<br>\
(tropical:)  [app. meaning May God make thine eye to be<br>\
refreshed by the sight of him whom thou lovest,<br>\
and make the eye of thine enemy to be pained by<br>\
the sight of him whom he hateth: or may God<br>\
make an eye to be refreshed by the sight of thee,<br>\
and make an eye to be affected with hatred by<br>\
the sight of thine enemy].<br>\
5<br>\
تبغّض He manifested, or showed, hatred;<br>\
or he became, or made himself, an object of<br>\
hatred; contr. of تَحَبَّبَ. (K.) You say, تَحَبَّبَ<br>\
لِى فُلَانٌ وَ تَبَغَّضَ لِى أَخُوهُ [Such a one manifested<br>\
love to me, or made himself an object of love to<br>\
me, and his brother manifested hatred to me,<br>\
or made himself an object of hatred to me]. (A,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تباغض القَوْمُ The company of men hated one<br>\
another: (Msb:) تَبَاغُضٌ is the contr. of تَحَابُبٌ.<br>\
(S, K.) You say, مَا رَأَيْتُ أَشَدَّ تَبَاغُضًا مِنْهُمَا [I<br>\
have not seen any more vehement in mutual hatred<br>\
than they two]. (A, TA.)<br>\
بُغْضٌ Hatred; contr. of حُبُّ: (S, A, K:) a<br>\
subst. from أَبْغَضَهُ. (Msb.)<br>\
بِغْضَةٌ Vehement hatred; as also ↓ بَغْضَآءُ, (S, A,<br>\
Msb, K,) and ↓ بَغَاضَةٌ [but see 1]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also بَغِيضٌ.<br>\
بَغْضَآءُ: see what next precedes.<br>\
بَغُوضٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
بَغِيضٌ Hateful; odious; and object of hatred:<br>\
(S, A, Msb, * K:) hated; as also ↓ بَغُوضٌ (TA)<br>\
and ↓ مُبْغَضٌ: (Msb, * TA:) pl. of the first, بُغَضَآءُ.<br>\
(A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Some say that it has also the contr.<br>\
signification of Hating; i. q. ↓ مُبْغِضٌ: (TA:)<br>\
and Skr explains ↓ بِغْضَةٌ as signifying people<br>\
hating thee. (L, TA. *)<br>\
بَغَاضَةٌ: see بِغْضَةٌ.<br>\
مُبْغَضٌ: see بَغِيضٌ.<br>\
مُبْغِضٌ: see بَغِيضٌ.<br>\
مَبْغَضَةٌ [A cause of hatred: a word of the same<br>\
class as مَبْخَلَةٌ and مَجْبَنَةٌ]. (A.)<br>\
