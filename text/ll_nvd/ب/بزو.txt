بَزَا, aor. يَبْزُو, i. q. تَطَاوَلَ [app. as meaning<br>\
He stretched out his neck, looking at a thing far<br>\
off]; and تَأَنَّسَ [here meaning the same, or he<br>\
looked, raising his head; said of a hawk, or<br>\
falcon]: (Az, ISd, K:) and hence IJ says that<br>\
↓ بَازٌ is [originally] of the measure فَلْعٌ from this<br>\
verb: (TA: [and it is said in the K that بَازٍ<br>\
seems to be hence derived:]) for [or تطاول may<br>\
here be used in another sense; for, accord. to Fei,]<br>\
بَزَا, aor. as above, signifies he overcame, or subdued; and hence is derived ↓ بَازٍ. (Msb.) You<br>\
say also, بَزَا عَلَيْهِ, aor. as above, meaning تطاول<br>\
[i. e., thus followed by عليه, He held up his head<br>\
with an assumption of superiority over him;<br>\
behaved haughtily towards him; exalted himself<br>\
above him; or overpowered, subdued, or oppressed,<br>\
him]. (S.) And بُزِىَ بِالقَوْمِ The people, or company of men, were overcome, or subdued. (TA.)<br>\
And بَزَاهُ, aor. as above, (K,) inf. n. بَزْوٌ, (TA,)<br>\
He overcame, or subdued, him; and laid violent<br>\
hands upon him, or assaulted him; as also ↓ ابزى<br>\
بِهِ: (K:) or this last signifies he overcame him,<br>\
and subdued him: (S:) and بَزَاهُ, he wronged him;<br>\
or treated him wrongfully, or injuriously: and<br>\
↓ ابزاهُ may signify the same; or this may mean<br>\
he induced him to become أَبْزَى, q. v.: (Ham p.<br>\
502:) and accord. to Aboo-Riyásh, ↓ ابزى signifies he pressed heavily upon his adversary, or<br>\
imposed on him that which he was unable to do,<br>\
or to bear, in order to treat him wrongfully, or<br>\
injuriously. (Ham pp. 104 and 105.) [It is said<br>\
that] بَزَوَانٌ [an inf. n. of which the verb, if it<br>\
have one, is بَزَا,] signifies the act of Leaping;<br>\
syn. وَثْبٌ. (S: [but I think it not improbable<br>\
that this may have been taken from a mistranscription of نَزَوَانٌ, an inf. n. of نَزَا.])<br>\

projected over the hinder part of the thighs: or<br>\
he had the breast bulging forward and the posteriors backward, so that he appeared unable to<br>\
straighten his back. (T, TA.) [See also 4.] The<br>\
epithet is أَبْزَى: fem. بَزْوَآءُ. (S, K.)<br>\

bowed, himself to others. (TA.) Accord. to IAar,<br>\
