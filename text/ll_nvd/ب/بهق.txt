comes upon the external skin of a man; (JK;) a<br>\
whiteness that affects the skin, (S,) or body,<br>\

(S, Mgh,) or not بَرَص: (Msb:) and, accord. to<br>\
IF, a blackness that affects the skin; [i. e. the<br>\
species of leprosy termed “melas,” or “lepra<br>\
maculosa nigra;”] or a colour differing from<br>\
that of the skin: (Msb:) a thin whiteness<br>\
that affects the exterior of the cuticle, by reason<br>\
of a bad state of the temperament of the part,<br>\
inclining to coldness, and the predominance of the<br>\
phlegm over the blood: the black [species] thereof<br>\
alters (يُغَيِّرُ, in the CK يَعْتَرِى,) the skin to blackness, by reason of the mixing of the black bile<br>\
with the blood. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
