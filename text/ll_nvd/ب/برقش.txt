Q. 2<br>\
تَبَرْقَشَ He adorned himself (A, K) with<br>\
various colours. (K.) You say, تَبَرْقَشَ لَنَا He<br>\
adorned himself with various colours for us: (K:)<br>\
or with various colours of every kind. (TA.)<br>\
And تَبَرْقَشَتْ She assumed various colours: or<br>\

بِرْقِشٌ A certain bird, (S, K,) different from<br>\
that called أَبُو بَرَاقِشَ, (K, accord. to the TA, [for<br>\
we there read طَائِرٌ آخَرُ; the bird called ابو براقش<br>\
having been mentioned before; but in the CK,<br>\
in the place of آخَرُ, we find أَخْضَرُ, i. e., green;])<br>\
of small size, (S, TA,) that assumes various colours,<br>\
of the kind called حُمَّر, (TA,) like the sparrow,<br>\
(S, TA,) and called شُرْشُورٌ (S, K) by the people<br>\

براقش. (TA.)<br>\
بَرْقَشَةٌ The diversity of colour of that which is<br>\
termed أَرْقَشُ. (K.) [See also 1.]<br>\
أَبُو بَرَاقِشَ A certain bird that assumes various<br>\
colours; (S;) a small wild bird, like the قَنْفُذ [or<br>\
hedge-hog, but قُنْفُذ is probably a mistranscription<br>\
for قُنْبُر, or lark], the upper part of whose feathers<br>\
is dust-coloured (أَغْبَرُ, as in the K, accord. to the<br>\
TA), or white (أَغَرُّ, as in some copies of the K),<br>\
and the middle red, and the lower part black, so<br>\
that when it is roused, or provoked, it ruffles its<br>\
feathers and becomes variously changed in colour:<br>\
(Lth, K:) or a certain bird that is found in the<br>\
trees called عِضَاه, and the colour of which is<br>\
between blackness and whiteness, having six قَوَادِم<br>\
[or primary feathers], three on each side, heavy<br>\
in the rump, that makes a noise with its wings<br>\
when it flies, and assumes various colours: (IKh:)<br>\
