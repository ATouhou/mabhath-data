بنّجهُ, inf. n. تَبْنِيجٌ, [He dosed him, or stupified him, with بَنْج, q. v.;] he gave him بَنْج to<br>\
eat. (K.) [See the act. part. n. below.]<br>\
بَنْجٌ [Hyoscyamus, or henbane;] an arabicized<br>\
word, [said to be] from [the Persian] بَنْكْ; [but<br>\
see a quotation from Hammer-Purgstall, near the<br>\
close of this paragraph;] a certain plant, (Mgh,<br>\
and Har p. 365,) having an intoxicating kind of<br>\
grain, or, as some say, (Mgh,) of which the leaves<br>\
and peel and seeds torpify: (Mgh, Har:) it is<br>\
said, in the Kánoon, (Mgh,) by Aboo-&#39;Alee [Ibn-Seenà, or Avicenna], (Har,) that it is a poison<br>\
which confuses the intellect, and annuls the memory,<br>\
and occasions insanity and [the disorder termed]<br>\
خُنَاق [or quinsy]; (Mgh, Har;) and it is red,<br>\
and white: (Har:) a certain plant having a kind<br>\
of grain that confuses the intellect, and occasions<br>\
alienation of the mind, or insanity; and sometimes<br>\
it intoxicates, when a man drinks it after it has<br>\
been dissolved; and it is said to occasion forgetfulness: (Msb:) a certain torpifying plant, well<br>\
known; different from حَشِيشُ الحَرَافِيشِ; disordering the intellect (مُخَبِّطٌ لِلْعَقْلِ), rendering<br>\
insane, allaying the pains of humours and pustules, and the earache, (K, TA,) applied as a<br>\
liniment or as a poultice; (TA;) the worst kind<br>\
(K, TA) for use (TA) is the black; then, the<br>\
red; and the safest kind is the white. (K, TA.)<br>\
[Kzw says that the leaves of the garden-hemp<br>\
(قِنَّب بُسْتَانِىّ, or شَهْدَانَجِ, the latter of which<br>\
properly signifies hemp-seed,) are the بَنْج which,<br>\
when eaten, disorders the intellect. And ElIdreesee applies the appellation حَشِيشِيَّة to the<br>\
“ Assassins. ” This establishes the correctness of<br>\
De Sacy&#39;s opinion, that the appellation “ Assassins ” is derived from the vulgar pl. حَشَّاشِين,<br>\
(hemp-eaters, or persons who intoxicate themselves with hemp,) for حَشَّاشِين is syn. with<br>\
حَشِيشَّة, and the sect called by us the “ Assassins ”<br>\
are expressly said by the Arabs to have made<br>\
frequent use of بَنْج. Baron Hammer-Purgstall,<br>\
correctly regarding بَنْج as hyoscyamus (or henbane), makes the following important observations,<br>\
“ ‘ Bendj, ’ the pl. of which in Coptic is ‘ nibendj, ’<br>\
is without doubt the same plant as the ‘ nepenthe, ’<br>\
which has hitherto so much perplexed the commentators of Homer. Helen evidently brought<br>\
the nepenthe from Egypt, and bendj is there still<br>\
reputed to possess all the wonderful qualities which<br>\
Homer attributes to it. ” (Trébutien, “Contes<br>\
Inédits des Mille et une Nuits,” tome i. p. 12,<br>\
note.)] The phrase شَرِبَ البَنْجَ is used by ElKarkhee [as meaning He drank the بنج] because<br>\
it is mixed with water; or [as meaning he took,<br>\
or swallowed, the بنج,] according to the conventional language of the physicians. (Mgh.)<br>\
مُبَنِّجٌ One who employs a stratagem by means<br>\
of food containing بَنْج [in order to obtain some<br>\
advantage over another, by stupifying him therewith; as the “ Assassins ” used to do]. (Mgh.)<br>\
