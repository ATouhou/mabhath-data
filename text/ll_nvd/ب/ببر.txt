known; (K;) a certain animal, (Msb,) namely,<br>\
the فُرَانِق [or lion&#39;s provider], (S,) that emulates,<br>\
or vies with, the lion in running, or that is hostile<br>\
to the lion: [so may be rendered the words<br>\
يُعَادِى الأَسَدَ; and in the uncertainty that exists<br>\
respecting the animal in question, the meaning<br>\
of this expression is doubtful: an animal may<br>\
be called (as the jackal is) the lion&#39;s provider<br>\
merely because the lion follows it and deprives<br>\
it of its prey:] (S, Msb:) or a certain Indian<br>\
animal, stronger than the lion, between which<br>\
and the lion and leopard, or panther, (نَمِر,)<br>\
exists hostility (مُعَادَاةٌ); when it attacks the<br>\
leopard, or panther, (نمر,), the lion aids the<br>\
latter; but the scorpion is on friendly terms<br>\
with it, and sometimes makes its abode in its<br>\
hair: (Kzw:) the word is foreign, or Persian,<br>\
(أَعْجَمِىٌّ,) [app. the Persian بَبَرْ, which is said to be<br>\
applied to the tiger, leopard, and lion,] arabicized:<br>\
(M, K:) Az thinks it to be a foreign word introduced into the Arabic language: (Msb:) pl. بُبُورٌ.<br>\
