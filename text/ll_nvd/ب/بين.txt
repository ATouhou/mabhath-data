بَانَ, (M, Mgh, Msb, K,) [aor. يَبِينُ,] inf. n.<br>\
بَيْنُونَةٌ and بُيُونٌ (M, Mgh, K) and بَيْنٌ, (M, K,)<br>\
It (a thing) became separated, severed, disunited,<br>\
or cut off, (M, Mgh, Msb, K,) عَنِ الشَّىْءِ from<br>\
the thing. (Mgh.) And بَانَتْ, (M, K,) or بَانَتْ<br>\
بِالطَّلَاقِ, (Msb,) She (a wife) became separated by<br>\
divorce, (M, Msb, K,) عَنِ الرَّجُلِ from the man.<br>\
(M, K.) And بَانَتٌ said of a girl, [She became<br>\
separated from her parents by marriage;] she<br>\
married: (ISh, T:) as though she became at a<br>\
distance from the house of her father. (ISh, TA.)<br>\
And بَانَ, (M,) or بَانَ بِمَالٍ, aor. يَبِينُ, (T,) inf. n.<br>\
بُيُونٌ (T, M) and بَيْنٌ, (M,) He became separated<br>\
from his father, or mother, or both, by property<br>\
[which he received from him, or her, or them,]<br>\
(AZ, T, M,) to be his alone: (AZ, T:) and ElFárisee states, on the authority of AZ, that one]<br>\
says also, بَانَ عَنْهُ and بَانَهُ [the former app.<br>\
meaning he became separated thus from him, i. e.,<br>\
from his father; and the latter being syn. with<br>\
أَبَانَهُ, q. v.]. (M.) And بَانَ الخَلِيطُ, inf. n. بَيْنٌ<br>\
and بَيْنُونَةٌ, [The partner, or copartner, or sharer,<br>\
&amp;c., became separated from the person, or persons,<br>\
with whom he had been associated.] (T.) And<br>\
بَانَتْ يَدُ النَّاقَةِ عَنْ جَنْبِهَا, inf. n. بُيُونٌ, [The fore<br>\
leg of the she-camel became withdrawn, or apart,<br>\
from her side.] (T.) And بَانَ, (S, M, Msb,)<br>\
and بَانُوا, (K,) aor. يَبِينُ, (S,) inf. n. بَيْنٌ and<br>\
بَيْنُونَةٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) He separated himself, or<br>\
it separated itself; (S; [in one copy of which it<br>\
is said of a thing;]) and they separated themselves: (K:) or it (a tribe, M, Msb) went, journeyed, went away, or departed; and went, removed, retired, or withdrew itself, to a distance,<br>\
or far away, or far off. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بَانَ, (T, S,<br>\
M, &amp;c.,) aor. يَبِينُ, (T, Msb,) inf. n. بَيَانٌ; (T,<br>\
S, Mgh, K;) and ↓ ابان, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) inf. n.<br>\
إِبَانَةٌ; (T, Msb;) and ↓ بيّن, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,)<br>\
inf. n. تَبْيِينٌ; (S;) and ↓ تبيّن; and ↓ استبان;<br>\
(T, S, M, &amp;c.,) all signify the same; (T, M,<br>\
Msb;) i. e. It (a thing, T, S, M, Mgh, or an<br>\
affair, or a case, Msb) was, or became, [distinct,<br>\
as though separate from others; and thus,] apparent, manifest, evident, clear, plain, or perspicuous: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) and it was, or became,<br>\
known. (K.) You say, بَانَ الحَقُّ [The truth<br>\
became apparent, &amp;c.; or known]; as also ↓ ابان.<br>\
(T.) And<br>\
الصُّبْحُ لِذِى عَيْنَيْنِ ↓ قَدْ بَيَّنَ<br>\
The dawn has become apparent to him who has<br>\
two eyes: a prov.: (S, M:) applied to a thing<br>\
that becomes altogether apparent, or manifest.<br>\
(Har p. 542.) And it is said in the Kur [ii. 257],<br>\
الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الغَىِّ ↓ قَدْ تَبَيَّنَ [The right belief hath<br>\
become distinguished from error]. (TA.) And<br>\
the lawyers, correctly, use the phrase, كَصَوْتٍ لَا<br>\
مِنْهُ حُرُوفٌ ↓ يَسْتَبِينُ [Like a sound whereof letters<br>\
are not distinguishable]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [It seems to<br>\
be indicated in the TA that بَانَ, aor. يَبِينُ, inf. n.<br>\
بَيْنٌ and بَيْنُونَةٌ, also signifies It was, or became,<br>\
united, or connected; thus having two contr.<br>\
meanings; but I have not found the verb used in<br>\
this sense, though بَيْنٌ signifies both disunion and<br>\
union.]<br>\
-A2-  بَانَهُ, aor. يَبِينُ, inf. n. بَيْنٌ: see بَانَهُ,<br>\
aor. يَبُونُ, inf. n. بَوْنٌ, in art. بون.<br>\
-A3-  See also 2,<br>\
in two places.<br>\
2<br>\
بيّن, intrans., inf. n. تَبْيِينٌ: see 1, in two<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also, بيّن الشَّجَرُ The trees,<br>\
(K,) or the leaves of the trees, (TA,) appeared,<br>\
when beginning to grow forth. (K, TA.) And<br>\
بيّن القَرْنُ (tropical:)  The horn came forth. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
بيّن بِنْتَهُ: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  بيّنهُ, (T, Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَبْيِينٌ (T, S) and ↓ تِبْيَانٌ (T, S, * K *) and تَبْيَانٌ;<br>\
(K;) the second of which three is an anomalous<br>\
inf. n., (T, S, K,) for by rule it should be of the<br>\
measure تَفْعَالٌ; (T, S;) but تَبْيَانٌ is not known<br>\
except accord. to the opinion of those who allow<br>\
the authority of analogy, which opinion is outweighed by the contrary; (TA;) and تِبْيَانٌ is<br>\
the only inf. n. of its measure except تِلْقَآءٌ, (T, S,)<br>\
accord. to the generality of the leading authorities;<br>\
but some add تِمْثَالٌ, as inf. n. of مَثَّلَ; and<br>\
El-Hareeree adds to these two, in the Durrah,<br>\
تِنْضَالٌ, as inf. n. of نَاضَلَهُ; and Esh-Shiháb<br>\
adds, in the Expos. of the Durrah, تِشْرَابٌ, as<br>\
inf. n. of شَرِبَ الخَمْرَ; asserting تَشْرَابٌ also to<br>\
have been heard, agreeably with analogy; [and<br>\
to these may be added تَبْكَآءٌ and تِمْشَآءٌ, and perhaps<br>\
some other instances of the same kind;] but some<br>\
disallow تِفْعَالٌ altogether as the measure of an<br>\
inf. n., saying that the words transmitted as instances thereof are simple substs. used as inf. ns.,<br>\
like طَعَامٌ in the place of إِطْعَامٌ; (MF, TA;)<br>\
and Sb says that تِبْيَانٌ is not an inf. n.; for,<br>\
where it so, it would be تَبْيَانٌ; but it is, from<br>\
بَيَّنْتُ, like غَارَةٌ from أَغَرْتُ; (M, TA;) [He made<br>\
it distinct, as though separate from others; and<br>\
thus,] he made it (namely, a thing, T, S, Mgh,<br>\
or an affair, or a case, Msb) apparent, manifest,<br>\
evident, clear, plain, or perspicuous; (S, Msb,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ ابانهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
إِبَانَةٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ تبيّنهُ; (S, * Msb, K;) and<br>\
↓ استبانهُ: (Mgh, Msb, K:) [بيّنهُ is the most<br>\
common in this sense: and often signifies he<br>\
explained it: and he proved it:] and ↓ all these<br>\
verbs signify also he made it known; he notified<br>\
it: (K:) or ↓ اِسْتَبَنْتُهُ signifies, (S,) or signifies<br>\
also, (Mgh,) I knew it, or became acquainted<br>\
with it, [or distinguished it,] (S, Mgh,) clearly,<br>\
or plainly; (Mgh;) and so ↓ تَبَيَّنْتُهُ; (S, * Mgh;)<br>\
[and بَيَّنْتُهُ, as appears from an ex. in what follows,<br>\
from a verse of En-Nábighah:] ↓ بِنْتُهُ and ↓ أَبَنْتُهُ<br>\
and ↓ اِسْتَبَنْتُهُ and بَيَّنْتُهُ all signify the same as<br>\
↓ تَبَيَّنْتُهُ [app. in all the senses of this verb]: (M:)<br>\
or, of all these verbs, ↓ بَانَ is only intrans.:<br>\
(Msb:) and ↓ اِسْتَبَنْتُهُ signifies I looked at it, or<br>\
into it, (namely, a thing,) considered it, examined<br>\
it, or studied it, repeatedly, in order that it might<br>\
become apparent, manifest, evident, clear, or plain,<br>\
to me: (T, TA:) and ↓ تبيّنهُ he looked at it, or<br>\
into it, (namely, an affair, or a case,) considered<br>\
it, examined it, or studied it, repeatedly, or deliberately, in order to know its real state by the<br>\
external signs thereof. (T.) A poet says,<br>\
وَمَا خِفْتُ حَتَّى بَيَّنَ الشِّرْبُ وَالأَذَى<br>\
↓ بقَانِئَةٍ أَنِّى مِنَ الحَىِّ أَبْيَنُ<br>\
[And I feared not until the drinking, or the time<br>\
of drinking, and molestation, made manifest, or<br>\
plainly showed, by a deep-red (sun), that I was<br>\
separated from the tribe: see قَانِئٌ]. (M.) And<br>\
it is said in the Kur [xvi. 91], وَأَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الكِتَابَ<br>\
تِبْيَانًا لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ [And we have sent down to thee<br>\
the Scripture to make manifest everything];<br>\
meaning, we make manifest to thee in the Scripture everything that thou and thy people require<br>\
[to know] respecting matters of religion. (T.)<br>\
See also بَيَانٌ, in the latter half of the paragraph.<br>\
En-Nábighah says,<br>\
إِلَّا الأَوَارِىَّ مَّا أُبَيِّنُهَا<br>\
[Except the places of the confinement of the<br>\
beasts: with difficulty did I distinguish them];<br>\
meaning ↓ أَتَبَيَّنُهَا. (S.) You say also, مَا ↓ تَبَيَّنَ<br>\
يَأْتِيهِ, meaning He sought, or endeavoured, to see,<br>\
or discover, what would happen to him, of good<br>\
and evil. (M in art. بصر.) [See also 5, below.]<br>\
سَبِيلَ المُجْرِمِينَ ↓ وَلِتَسْتَبِينَ, in the Kur [vi. 55],<br>\
means And that thou mayest the more consider,<br>\
or examine, repeatedly, in order that it may<br>\
become manifest to thee, the way of the sinners,<br>\
O Mohammad: (T:) or that thou mayest seek,<br>\
or endeavour, to see plainly, or clearly, &amp;c.; syn.<br>\
وَلِتَسْتَوْضِحَ سَبِيلَهُمْ: (Bd:) but most read, وَلِيَسْتَبِينَ<br>\
سيبلُ المجرمين; the verb in this case being<br>\
intrans. (T.)<br>\
3<br>\
باينهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُبَايَنَةٌ, (S,) He separated<br>\
himself from him; or left, forsook, or abandoned,<br>\
him: (S, TA:) or he forsook, or abandoned, him,<br>\
being forsaken, or abandoned, by him; or cut<br>\
him off from friendly or loving communion or<br>\
intercourse, being so cut off by him; or cut him,<br>\
or ceased to speak to him, being in like manner<br>\
cut by him. (K.) [And It became separated<br>\
from it.]<br>\
4<br>\
ابان, intrans., inf. n. إِبَانَةٌ: see 1, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
-A2-  ابانهُ, (inf. n. as above, TA,) He separated it, severed it, disunited it, or cut it off.<br>\
(M, Msb, K, TA.) You say, ضَرَبَهُ فَأَبَانَ رَأْسَهُ<br>\
(S, K) He smote him and severed his head, مِنْ<br>\
جَسَدِهِ from his body. (S, TA.) And ابان المَرْأَةَ<br>\
He (the husband) separated the woman, or wife,<br>\
by divorce. (Msb.) And ابان بِنْتَهُ, and ↓ بيّنها,<br>\
(T, K,) inf. n. of the former as above, and of the<br>\
latter تَبْيِينٌ, (TA,) He married, or gave in<br>\
marriage, his daughter, (T, K,) and she went<br>\
to her husband: (T:) from بَيْنٌ signifying &quot;distance:&quot; as though he removed her to a distance<br>\
from the house, or tent, of her mother. (TA.)<br>\
And ابان ابْنَهُ بِمَالٍ, (M,) or ابانهُ أَبَوَاهُ, (T,) He<br>\
separated from himself his son, (M,) or his two<br>\
parents separated him from themselves, (T,) by<br>\
[giving him] property, (T, M,) to be his alone:<br>\
(T:) mentioned on the authority of AZ. (T, M.)<br>\
And ابان الدَّلْوَ عَنْ طِىِّ البِئْرِ He drew away the<br>\
bucket from the casing of the well, lest the latter<br>\
should lacerate the former. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 2,<br>\
in three places. ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, ابان signifies also He<br>\
spoke, or wrote, perspicuously, clearly, plainly,<br>\
or distinctly, as to meaning; or, with eloquence:<br>\
from بَيَانٌ, q. v.] And ابان عَلَيْهِ He spoke perspicuously, clearly, plainly, or distinctly, and<br>\
gave his testimony, or evidence, or gave decisive<br>\
information, against him, or respecting it. (TA.)<br>\
[The verb thus used is for ابان كَلَامَهُ, and شَهَادَتَهُ.]<br>\
One says of a drunken man, مَا يُبِينُ كَلَامًا He<br>\
does not speak plainly, or distinctly; lit., does<br>\
not make speech plain, or distinct. (Ks, T in<br>\
art. بت.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [مَا أَبْيَنَهُ How distinct, apparent,<br>\
manifest, evident, clear, or plain, is it! See<br>\
an ex. voce بَسُلَ. ―<br>\
-b5-  And How perspicuous, or<br>\
chaste, or eloquent, is he in speech, or writing!<br>\
how good is his بَيَان!]<br>\
5<br>\
تبيّن, intrans.: see 1, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  As a<br>\
trans. verb: see 2, in seven places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,<br>\
الأَمْرَ being understood,] He sought, or sought<br>\
leisurely or repeatedly, to obtain knowledge [of<br>\
the thing], until he knew [it]; he examined,<br>\
scrutinized, or investigated: (Bd in xlix. 6:) he<br>\
sought, or endeavoured, to make the affair, or<br>\
case, manifest, and to settle it, or establish it, and<br>\
was not hasty therein: (Idem in iv. 96:) or he<br>\
acted, or proceeded, deliberately, or leisurely, in<br>\
the affair, or case; not hastily: (Ks, TA:) or it<br>\
has a signification like this: in the Kur ch. iv. v. 96<br>\
and ch. xlix. v. 6, some read فَتَبَيَّنُوا, and others<br>\
فَتَثَبَّتُوا; and the meanings are nearly the same:<br>\
التَّبَيُّنُ was said by Mohammad to be from God,<br>\
and العَجَلَةٌ [i. e. &quot;haste&quot;] from the devil. (T.)<br>\
6<br>\
تباينا They two (namely, two men, and two<br>\
copartners,) became separated, each from the<br>\
other: (M, TA:) or they forsook, or abandoned,<br>\
each other; or cut each other off from friendly<br>\
or loving communion or intercourse; or cut, or<br>\
ceased to speak to, each other. (K.) And تباينوا<br>\
They, having been together, became separated:<br>\
(Msb:) or they forsook, or abandoned, one another;<br>\
or cut one another off from friendly or loving<br>\
communion or intercourse; or cut, or ceased to<br>\
speak to, one another. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, They two<br>\
were dissimilar: and they two (namely, words,)<br>\
were disparate; whether contraries or not: and<br>\
they two (namely, numbers,) were incommensurable.]<br>\
10<br>\
استبان, intrans.: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  As a trans. verb:<br>\
see 2, in six places.<br>\
بَانٌ a coll. gen. n.: n. un. with ة: see art. بون.<br>\
بَيْنٌ has two contr. significations; (T, S, Msb;)<br>\
one of which is Separation, or disunion [of companions or friends or lovers]. (T, S, M, Msb, K.)<br>\
Hence, ذَاتُ البَيْنِ as meaning Enmity, and vehement hatred: and the saying لِإِصْلَاحِ ذَاتِ البَيْنِ,<br>\
i. e. For the reforming, or amending, of the bad,<br>\
or corrupt, state subsisting between the people, or<br>\
company of men; meaning for the allaying of the<br>\
discord, enmity, rancour, or vehement hatred:<br>\
(Msb:) [but this has also the contr. meaning, as<br>\
will be seen below: and it is explained as having<br>\
a vague import; for it is said that] فِى إِصْلَاحِ ذَاتِ<br>\
البَيْنِ means In the reforming, or amending, of<br>\
the circumstances subsisting between the persons to<br>\
whom it relates, by frequent attention thereto.<br>\
(Mgh.) [Hence also,] غُرَابُ البَيْنِ [The raven of<br>\
separation or disunion; i. e., whose appearance,<br>\
or croak, is ominous of separation: said by some<br>\
to be] the غراب termed أَبْقَعُ [i. e. in which is<br>\
blackness and whiteness; or having whiteness in<br>\
the breast]; (S, K;) so described by the poet<br>\
&#39;Antarah: (S:) or that which is red in the beak<br>\
and legs; but the black is called الحَاتِمُ, because<br>\
it makes [or shows] separation to be absolutely<br>\
unavoidable, (Abu-1-Ghowth, S, K,) according to<br>\
the assertion of the Arabs, i. e., by its croak:<br>\
(Msb in art. حتم:) [or it is any species of the<br>\
corvus:] Hamzeh says, in his Proverbs, that this<br>\
name attaches to the غراب because, when the<br>\
people of an abode go away to seek after herbage,<br>\
it alights in the place of their tents, searching the<br>\
sweepings: (Har p. 308:) but accord. to the<br>\
Kádee of Granada, Aboo-&#39;Abd-Allah Esh-Shereef,<br>\
this appellation, so often occurring in poetry,<br>\
properly signifies camels that transport people<br>\
from one district, or country, to another; and<br>\
he cites the following verses:<br>\
غَلِطَ الَّذِينَ رَأَيْتُهُمْ بِجَهَالَةٍ<br>\
يَلْحَوْنَ كُلُّهُمُ غُرَابًا يَنْعَقُ<br>\
مَا الذَّنْبُ إِلَّا لِلْأَبَاعِرِ إِنَّهَا<br>\
مِمَّا يُشَتِّتُ جَمْعَهُمْ وَيُقَرِّقُ<br>\
إِنَّ الغُرَابَ بِيُمْنِهِ تُدْنُو النَّوَى<br>\
وَتُشَتِّتُ الشَّمْلَ الجَمِيعَ الأَيْنُقُ<br>\
[Those have erred whom I have seen, with ignorance, all of them blaming a raven croaking:<br>\
the fault is not imputable save to the camels; for<br>\
they are of the things that scatter and disperse<br>\
their congregation: verily the place that is the<br>\
object of a journey is brought near by the raven&#39;s<br>\
lucky omen; but the she-camels discompose the<br>\
united state]: and Ibn-&#39;Abd-Rabbih says,<br>\
زَعَقَ الغُرَابُ فَقُلْتُ أَكْذَبُ طَائِرٍ<br>\
إِن لَّمْ يُصَدِّقْهُ رُغَآءُ بَعِيرِ<br>\
[The raven cried; and I said, A most lying bird,<br>\
if the grumbling cry of a camel on the occasion<br>\
of his being laden do not verify it]. (TA in art.<br>\
غرب.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Distance, (S, M, Msb, K,) by the<br>\
space, or interval, between two things. (Msb.)<br>\
You say, بَيْنَ البَلَدَيْنِ بَيْنٌ Between the two countries, or towns, &amp;c., is a distance, of space, or<br>\
interval: (Msb:) and بَيْنَهُمَا بَيْنٌ Between them<br>\
two is a distance, with ى when corporeal distance is meant: (Idem in art. بون:) or إِنَّ بَيْنَهُمَا<br>\
لَبَيْنٌ [Verily between them two is a distance], not<br>\
otherwise, in the case of [literal] distance. (S.)<br>\
And you say also, بَيْنَهُمَا بَيْنٌ بَعِيدٌ (T in art. بون,<br>\
S, M *) and بَوْنٌ بَعِيدٌ (T in art. بون, S, M, * Msb *<br>\
in art. بون) Between them two [meaning two<br>\
men] is a [wide] distance; (M;) i. e. between<br>\
their two degrees of rank or dignity, or between<br>\
the estimations in which they are commonly held:<br>\
(Msb in art. بون:) in this case, the latter is the<br>\
more chaste. (S.) You also say, [using بين<br>\
to denote An interval of time,] لَقِيتُهُ بُعَيْدَاتِ بَيْنٍ<br>\
[I met him after, or a little after, an interval, or<br>\
intervals,] when you have met him after a while,<br>\
and then withheld yourself from him, and then<br>\
come to him. (S, M, K. See also بَعْدُ.])<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also Union [of companions or friends or lovers];<br>\
(T, S, M, Msb, K;) the contr. of the first of the<br>\
significations mentioned above in this paragraph.<br>\
(T, S, Msb.) [Hence ذَاتُ البَيْنِ as meaning The<br>\
state of union or concord or friendship or love<br>\
subsisting between a people or between two parties; this being likewise the contr. of a signification assigned to the same expression above:<br>\
whence the phrase, إِفْسَادُ ذَاتِ البَيْنِ (occurring in<br>\
the S and K in art. ابر, and often elsewhere,)<br>\
The marring, or disturbance, of the state of<br>\
union or concord &amp;c.: and] hence the saying,<br>\
سَعَى فُلَانٌ لِإِصْلَاحِ ذَاتِ البَيْنِ مِنْ عَشِيرَتِهِ [Such a<br>\
one laboured for the improving of the state<br>\
of union or concord &amp;c. of his kinsfolk; but<br>\
in this instance, the meaning given in the second<br>\
sentence of this paragraph seems to be more appropriate]. (Ham p. 569.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ذَاتُ بَيْنِهِمْ may also<br>\
be used as meaning The vacant space (سَاحَة) that<br>\
is between their houses, or tents. (Ham p. 195.)<br>\
-A3-  بَيْن is also an adverbial noun, [as such written<br>\
بَيْنَ,] (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) capable of being<br>\
used as a noun absolutely: (M, K:) it relates<br>\
only to that which has space, as a country; or to<br>\
that which has some number, either two or more,<br>\
as two men, and a company of men; and denotes<br>\
[intervention in] the interval between two things,<br>\
or the middle, or midst, of two things, (Er-Rághib, TA,) or the middle of a collective number: (S:) [thus it signifies Between, and amidst,<br>\
and among:] its meaning is [therefore] vague,<br>\
not apparent unless it is prefixed to two or more<br>\
[words, or to a word signifying two or more], or<br>\
to what supplies the place of such a complement:<br>\
(Msb:) it must necessarily be prefixed, and may<br>\
not be otherwise than in the manners just explained: (Mgh:) [i. e.] it may not be prefixed to<br>\
any noun but such as denotes more than one, or<br>\
to a noun that has another conjoined to it by و,<br>\
(M,) not by any other conjunction, (M, Msb,)<br>\
acc0ord. to the usage commonly obtaining. (Msb.)<br>\
You say بَيْنَ الرَّجُلَيْنِ [Between the two men]:<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA:) and المَالُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ [The property is between the company of men]: (M, Msb,<br>\
Er-Rághib: *) and المَالُ بَيْنَ زَيْدٍ وَعَمْرٍو [The<br>\
property is between Zeyd and &#39;Amr]: and هُوَ<br>\
بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَهُ [He, or it, is between me and him]:<br>\
(M:) and جَلَسْتُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ I sat in the middle<br>\
of [or amidst or among] the company of men:<br>\
(S, K:) and بَيْنَكُمَا البَعِيرَ فَخُذَاهُ, with البعير in the<br>\
accus. case, [See between you two the camel,<br>\
therefore take him], a saying heard by Ks: (Lin<br>\
art. عند:) and فَسَدَ مَا بَيْنَهُمْ [The state subsisting<br>\
among them became bad, or marred, or disturbed]:<br>\
(S and K in art. ميط:) and بَيْنَ الأَيَّامِ (M and K<br>\
in art. ندر) and فِيمَا بَيْنَ الأَيَّامِ (S and Msb in<br>\
that art.) [In, or during, the space of (several)<br>\
days]: and عَوَانٌ بَيْنَ ذٰلِكَ, in the Kur [ii. 63], is<br>\
an ex. of its being prefixed to a single word supplying the place of more than one; (Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
the meaning being, Of middle age, between that<br>\
which has been mentioned; namely, the فَارِض<br>\
and the بِكْر. (Bd.) Some allow that two words<br>\
to the former of which بَيْنَ is prefixed may be<br>\
connected by فَ, citing as an evidence the phrase<br>\
used by Imra-el-Keys, بَيْنَ الدَّخُولِ فَحَوْمَلِ [as<br>\
though meaning Between Ed-Dakhool and Howmal]: but to this it has been replied that الدخول<br>\
is a name applying to several places; so that the<br>\
phrase [means amidst Ed-Dakhool &amp;c., and] is<br>\
similar to the saying, المَالُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ [mentioned<br>\
above, or جَلَسْتُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ, also mentioned above].<br>\
(Msb.) [You say also, بَيْنَ أَظْهُرِهِمْ, and بَيْنَ ظَهْرَيْهِمْ<br>\
&amp;c., meaning In the midst of them. (See art.<br>\
ظهر.) And بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ, and بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِمْ, meaning<br>\
Before him, and before them. بَيْن is also often<br>\
used absolutely as a noun: thus it is in the Kur<br>\
lxxxvi. 7, يَخْرُجُ مِنْ بَيْنِ الصُّلْبِ وَالتَّرَائِبِ Coming<br>\
forth from between, or amidst, the spine and the<br>\
breast-bones: and in xxxvi. 8 of the same, وَجَعَلْنَا<br>\
مِنْ بَيْنِ أَيْديهِمْ سَدًّا And we have placed before<br>\
them (lit. between their hands) a barrier.] It is<br>\
said in the Kur [vi. 94], لَقَدْ تَقَطَّعَ بَيْنُكُمْ, as some<br>\
read; or بَيْنَكُمْ, as others: (T, S, M:) the former<br>\
means Verily your union hath become dissevered:<br>\
(AA, T, S, M:) the latter, that which was between<br>\
you; (مَا بَيْنَكُمْ, Ibn-Mes&#39;ood, T, S, or الَّذِى كَانَ<br>\
بَيْنَكُمْ, IAar, T;) or the state wherein ye were, in<br>\
respect of partnership among you: (Zj, T:) or<br>\
the state of circumstances, or the bond, or the<br>\
love, or affection, [formerly subsisting] among<br>\
you, or between you; or, accord. to Akh, بَيْنَكُمْ,<br>\
though in the accus. case as to the letter, is in the<br>\
nom. case as to the place, by reason of the verb,<br>\
and the adverbial termination is retained only because the word is commonly used as an adv. n.:<br>\
(M:) AHát disapproved of the latter reading;<br>\
but wrongly, because what is suppressed accord.<br>\
to this reading is implied by what precedes in the<br>\
same verse. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is often used as a partitive,<br>\
or distributive; as also مَا بَيْنَ: for ex.,] you say,<br>\
هُمْ بَيْنَ حَاذِفٍ وَقَاذِفٍ, (S and TA in art. قذف,)<br>\
or هُمْ مَا بَيْنَ حَاذفٍ وقاذفٍ, (TA in art. حذف,)<br>\
i. e. [They are partly, or in part,] beating with<br>\
the staff, or stick, and [partly, or in part,] pelting<br>\
with stones; [or some beating &amp;c., and the others<br>\
pelting &amp;c.] (S and TA, both in art. قذف, and<br>\
the latter in art. حذف.) [See also an ex. in a<br>\
verse cited voce خَيْطَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  هٰذَا بَيْنَ بَيْنَ means<br>\
This (namely, a thing, S, or a commodity, Msb)<br>\
is between good and bad: (S, Msb, K:) or of a<br>\
middling, or middle, sort: (M:) these two words<br>\
being two nouns made one, and indecl., with<br>\
fet-h for their terminations, (S, Msb, K,) like<br>\
خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ. (Msb.) الهَمْزَةُ المُخَفَّفَةُ [i. e. the<br>\
hemzeh uttered lightly] is called هَمْزَةٌ بَيْنَ بَيْنَ,<br>\
(S, M, K, *) i. e. A hemzeh that is between the<br>\
hemzeh and the soft letter whence is its vowel; (S,<br>\
M;) or هَمْزَةُ بَيْنِ بَيْنٍ, the first بين with kesreh<br>\
but without tenween, and the second with tenween,<br>\
(Sharh Shudhoor edh-Dhahab,) [i. e. the hemzeh<br>\
&amp;c.:] if it is with fet-h, it is between the hemzeh<br>\
and the alif, as in سَاَلَ, (S, M,) for سَأَلَ; (M;) if<br>\
with kesr, it is between the hemzeh and the yé,<br>\
as in سَيِمَ, (S, M,) for سَئِمَ; (M;) and if with<br>\
damm, it is between the hemzeh and the wáw, as<br>\
in لَوُمَ, (S, M,) for لَؤُمَ: (M:) it is never at the<br>\
beginning of a word, because of its nearness, by<br>\
reason of feebleness, to the letter that is quiescent,<br>\
(S, M,) though, notwithstanding this, it is really<br>\
movent: (S:) it is thus called because it is weak,<br>\
(Sb, S, M,) not having the power of the hemzeh<br>\
uttered with its proper sound, nor the clearness of<br>\
the letter whence is its vowel. (M.) &#39;Obeyd Ibn-El-Abras says,<br>\
تَحْمِى حَقِيقَتَنَا وَبَعْ ضُ القَوْمِ يَسْقُطُ بَيْنَ بَيْنَا<br>\
i. e. [Thou defendest what we ought to defend, or<br>\
our banner, or standard, while some of the people,<br>\
or company of men,] fall, one after another, in a<br>\
state of weakness, not regarded as of any account:<br>\
(S:) or it is as though he said, between these and<br>\
these; like a man who enters between two parties<br>\
in some affair, and falls, or slips, or commits a<br>\
mistake, and is not honourably mentioned in<br>\
relation to it: so says Seer: (IB, TA:) or between<br>\
entering into fight and holding back from it; as<br>\
when one says, Such a one puts forward a foot,<br>\
and puts back another. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  ↓ بَيْنَا and ↓ بَيْنَمَا<br>\
are of the number of inceptive حُرُوف: (M, K:)<br>\
this is clear if by حروف is meant &quot;words:&quot; that<br>\
they have become particles, no one says: they are<br>\
still adv. ns.: (MF, TA:) the former is بَيْنَ with<br>\
its [final] fet-hah rendered full in sound; and<br>\
hence the ا; (Mughnee in the section next after<br>\
that of وا, and K;) [i. e.,] it is of the measure<br>\
فَعْلَى [or فَعْلَا] from البَيْن, the [final] fet-hah<br>\
being rendered full in sound, and so becoming ا;<br>\
and the latter is بَيْنَ with مَا [restrictive of its<br>\
government] added to it; and both have the same<br>\
meaning [of While, or whilst]: (S:) or the ا in<br>\
the former is the restrictive ا; or, as some say, it<br>\
is a portion of the restrictive ما [in the latter]:<br>\
(Mughnee ubi suprà:) and these do not exclude<br>\
بَيْنَ from the category of nouns, but only cut it<br>\
off from being prefixed to another noun: (MF,<br>\
TA:) they are substitutes for that to which بَيْنَ<br>\
would otherwise be prefixed: (Mgh:) some say<br>\
that these two words are adv. ns. of time, denoting<br>\
a thing&#39;s happening suddenly, or unexpectedly;<br>\
and they are prefixed to a proposition consisting<br>\
of a verb and an agent, or an inchoative and<br>\
enunciative; so that they require a complement<br>\
to complete the meaning. (TA.) One says, بَيْنَا<br>\
نَحْنُ كَذٰلِكَ إِذْ حَدَثَ كَذَا [While we were in<br>\
such a state as that, lo, or there, or then, such a<br>\
thing happened, or came to pass]: (M, Mgh, *<br>\
K: *) and بَيْنَمَا نَحْنُ كَذَا [While we were thus]:<br>\
(Mgh:) and<br>\
بَيْنَا نَحْنُ نَرْقُبُهُ أَتَانَا<br>\
[While we were looking, or waiting, for him, he<br>\
came to us]; (S, M;) a saying of a poet, cited by<br>\
Sb; (M;) the phrase being elliptical; (S, M;)<br>\
meaning بَيْنَ أَوْقَاتِ نَحْنُ نَرْقُبُهُ, (M,) i. e., بَيْنَ<br>\
أَوْقَاتِ رِقْبَتِنَا إِيَّاهُ [between the times of our looking,<br>\
or waiting, for him]. (S, M.) As used to put<br>\
nouns following بَيْنَا in the gen. case when بَيْنَ<br>\
might properly supply its place; as in the saying<br>\
(of Aboo-Dhu-eyb, which he thus recited, with<br>\
kesr, S),<br>\
بَيْنَا تَعَنُّقِهِ الكُمَاةَ وَرَوْغِهِ<br>\
يَوْمًا أُتِيحَ لَهُ جَرِىْءٌ سَلْفَعُ<br>\
[Amid his embracing the courageous armed men,<br>\
and his guileful eluding, one day a bold, daring<br>\
man was appointed for him, to slay him]: (S,<br>\
K:) in [some copies of] the K, تَعَنُّفِهِ; but in the<br>\
Deewán [of the Hudhalees], تعنّقه: [in the Mughnee, ubi suprà, تَعَانُقِهِ:] the meaning is بَيْنَ تَعَانُقِهِ;<br>\
the ا being added to give fulness to the sound of<br>\
the [final] vowel: (TA:) As used to say that the<br>\
ا is here redundant: (Skr, TA:) others put the<br>\
nouns following both بَيْنَا and بَيْنَمَا in the nom.<br>\
case, as the inchoative and enunciative. (Skr, S,<br>\
K.) Mbr says that when the noun following<br>\
بينا is a real subst., it is put in the nom. case as<br>\
an inchoative; but when it is an inf. n., or a noun<br>\
of the inf. kind, it is put in the gen., and بينا<br>\
in this instance has the meaning of بَيْنَ: and<br>\
Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà says the like, but some persons of chaste speech treat the latter kind of noun<br>\
like the former: after بينما, however, each kind<br>\
of noun must be in the nom. case. (AA, T.)<br>\
[See an ex. in a verse cited towards the end of<br>\
art. اذ.]<br>\
بَيْنَا see بَيْنٌ<br>\
بَيْنَمَا see بَيْنٌ<br>\
بِينٌ A separation, or division, (T, M, K,) between two things, (T,) or between two lands; (M,<br>\
K;) as when there is a rugged place, with sands<br>\
near it, and between the two is a tract neither<br>\
rugged nor plain: (T:) an elevation in rugged<br>\
ground: (M, K:) the extent to which the eye<br>\
reaches, (T, M, K,) of a road, (T,) or of land:<br>\
(M:) a piece of land extending as far as the eye<br>\
reaches: (T, S:) and a region, tract, or quarter:<br>\
(AA, T, M, K:) pl. بُيُونٌ. (S, TA.)<br>\
بَيَانٌ is originally the inf. n. of بَانَ as syn. with<br>\
تَبَيَّنَ, and so signifies The being [distinct or]<br>\
apparent &amp;c.; (Kull;) or it is a subst. in this<br>\
sense: (Msb:) or a subst. from بَيَّنَ, [and so<br>\
signifies the making distinct or apparent &amp;c.,]<br>\
being like سَلَامٌ and كَلَامٌ from سَلَّمَ and كَلَّمَ.<br>\
(Kull.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, conventionally, (Kull,) The<br>\
means by which one makes a thing [distinct,]<br>\
apparent, manifest, evident, clear, plain, or perspicuous: (S, Er-Rághib, TA, Kull:) this is of<br>\
two kinds: one is [a circumstantial indication<br>\
or evidence; or] a thing indicating, or giving<br>\
evidence of, a circumstance, or state, that is a<br>\
result, or an effect, of a quality or an attribute:<br>\
the other is a verbal indication or evidence, either<br>\
spoken or written: [see also بَيِّنَةٌ:] it is also<br>\
applied to language that discovers and shows the<br>\
meaning that is intended: and an explanation of<br>\
confused and vague language: (Er-Rághib, TA:)<br>\
or the eduction of a thing from a state of dubiousness to a state of clearness: or making the meaning apparent to the mind so that it becomes<br>\
distinct from other meanings and from what<br>\
might be confounded with it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
Perspicuity, clearness, distinctness, chasteness, or<br>\
eloquence, of speech or language: (T, S:) or<br>\
simply perspicuity thereof: (Har p. 2:) or perspicuity of speech with quickness, or sharpness, of<br>\
intellect: (M, K:) or perspicuous, or chaste, or<br>\
eloquent, speech, declaring, or telling plainly,<br>\
what is in the mind: (Ksh, TA:) or the showing<br>\
of the intent, or meaning, with the most eloquent<br>\
expression: it is an effect of understanding, and<br>\
of sharpness, or quickness, of mind, with perspicuity, or chasteness, or eloquence, of speech:<br>\
(Nh, TA:) or a faculty, or principles, [or a<br>\
science,] whereby one knows how to express [with<br>\
perspicuity of diction] one meaning in various<br>\
forms: (Kull:) [some of the Arabs restrict the<br>\
science of البيان to what concerns comparisons<br>\
and tropes and metonymies; which last the<br>\
Arabian rhetoricians distinguish from tropes: and<br>\
some make it to include rhetoric altogether:]<br>\
Esh-Shereeshee says, in his Expos. of the Maká-<br>\
mát [of El-Hareeree] that the difference between<br>\
بَيَانٌ and ↓ تِبْيَانٌ is this: that the former denotes<br>\
perspicuity of meaning; and the latter, the making<br>\
the meaning to be understood; and the former is<br>\
to another person, and the latter to oneself; but<br>\
sometimes the latter is used in the sense of the<br>\
former: (TA:) or the former is the act of the<br>\
tongue, and the latter is the act of the mind:<br>\
(Har p. 2:) or the former concerns the verbal<br>\
expression, and the latter concerns the meaning.<br>\
(Kull.) It is said in a trad., إِنَّ مِنَ البَيَانِ سِحْرًا<br>\
(S) or لَسِحْرًا (TA) [Verily there is a kind of<br>\
eloquence that is enchantment: see this explained<br>\
in art. سحر]. The saying in the Kur [lv. 2 and<br>\
3], خَلَقَ الْإِنْسَانَ عَلَّمَهُ الْبَيَانَ means He hath<br>\
created the Prophet: He hath taught him the<br>\
Kur-án wherein is the manifestation of everything<br>\
[needful to be known]: or He hath created Adam,<br>\
or man as meaning all mankind: He hath [taught<br>\
him speech, and so] made him to discriminate,<br>\
and thus to be distinguished from all [other]<br>\
animals:(Zj, T:) or He hath taught him that<br>\
whereby he is distinguished from other animals,<br>\
namely, the declaration of what is in the mind,<br>\
and the making others to understand what he has<br>\
perceived, for the reception of inspiration, and<br>\
the becoming acquainted with the truth, and the<br>\
learning of the law. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It is also applied<br>\
to Verbosity, and the going deep, or being extravagant, in speech, and affecting to be perspicuous,<br>\
or chaste, therein, or eloquent, and pretending to<br>\
excel others therein; or some بيان is thus termed;<br>\
and is blamed in a trad., as a kind of hypocrisy;<br>\
as though it were a sort of self-conceit and pride.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
بِئْرٌ بَيُونٌ A well of which the rope does not<br>\
strike against the sides, because its interior is<br>\
straight: or that is wide in the upper part, and<br>\
narrow in the lower: or in which the drawer of<br>\
water makes the rope to be aloof from its sides,<br>\
because of its crookedness: (T:) or deep and<br>\
wide; (S, K;) because the ropes are wide apart<br>\
from its sides; (S;) as also ↓ بَائِنَةٌ: (S, TA:) or<br>\
that is wide between the two [opposite] sides:<br>\
(M:) pl. [regularly of the latter epithet] بَوَائِنُ.<br>\
(T, S.)<br>\
بَيِّنٌ [Distinct, as though separate from others;<br>\
and thus,] apparent, manifest, evident, clear,<br>\
plain, or perspicuous; (T, S, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ بَائِنٌ (T) and ↓ مُبِينٌ: (T, S:) pl. [of mult.] أَبْيِنَآءُ<br>\
(S, K) and [of pauc.] بَيِنَةٌ. (K.) Hence, الكِتَابُ<br>\
↓ المُبِينٌ [as applied to the Kur, q. v. in xii. 1,<br>\
&amp;c.,] The clear, plain, or perspicuous, book or<br>\
writing or scripture: or, as some say, this means<br>\
the book &amp;c. that makes manifest all that is<br>\
required [to be known]: (T:) or, of which the<br>\
goodness and the blessing are made manifest: or,<br>\
that makes manifest the truth as distinguished<br>\
from falsity, and what is lawful as distinguished<br>\
from what is unlawful, and that the prophetic<br>\
office of Mohammad is true, and so are the narratives relating to the prophets: (Zj, T:) or, that<br>\
makes manifest the right paths as distinguished<br>\
from the wrong. (M, TA.) And كَلَامٌ بَيِّنٌ<br>\
Perspicuous, clear, distinct, chaste, or eloquent,<br>\
language. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A man, or thing, bearing evidence of a quality &amp;c. that he, or it, possesses. (S<br>\
and K and other Lexicons passim.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A man<br>\
(M) perspicuous, or clear, or distinct, in speech<br>\
or language; or chaste therein; or eloquent;<br>\
(ISh, T, M, K;) fluent, elegant, and elevated, in<br>\
speech, and having little hesitation therein: (ISh,<br>\
T:) pl. أَبْيِنَآءُ (T, M, K) and بُيَنَآءُ and [of pauc.]<br>\
أَبْيَانٌ: (Lh, M, K:) the second of these pls. is<br>\
anomalous: the last is formed by likening فَعِيلٌ<br>\
to فَاعِلٌ: [for بَيِّنٌ is a contraction of بَيِينٌ:] but<br>\
the pl. most agreeable with analogy is بَيِّنُونَ: so<br>\
says Sb. (M.)<br>\
بَيِّنَةٌ An evidence, an indication, a demonstration, a proof, a voucher, or an argument, (Mgh,<br>\
TA,) such as is manifest, or. clear, whether intellectual or perceived by sense; (TA;) [originally<br>\
بَيِينَةٌ,] of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ, from بَيْنُونَةٌ, [see 1,<br>\
first sentence,] and بَيَانٌ [q. v.]: (Mgh:) and<br>\
the testimony of a witness: pl. بَيِّنَاتٌ. (TA.)<br>\
بَائِنٌ In a state of separation or disunion; or<br>\
separated, severed, disunited, or cut off; (M, *<br>\
Msb;) as also ↓ أَبْيَنُ, occurring in a verse cited<br>\
above, voce بَيِّنَ. [Hence,] اِمْرَأَةٌ بَائِنٌ A woman<br>\
separated from her husband by divorce; (M,<br>\
Msb, K;) as also ↓ مُبَانَةٌ: the former without ة:<br>\
(Msb:) like طَالِقٌ and حَائِضٌ: you say [to a<br>\
wife] أَنْتِ بَائِنٌ [Thou art separated from me<br>\
by divorce.] (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  طَلَاقٌ بَائِنٌ is a tropical<br>\
phrase; and so is طَلْقَةٌ بَائِنَةٌ; (Mgh;) [signifying the same as] تَطْلِيقَةٌ بَائِنَةٌ (S, M, Msb, K) (tropical:)  A<br>\
divorce that is [as it were] cut off; i. q. ↓ مُبَانَةٌ<br>\
[in the second and third of these phrases, and<br>\
↓ مُبَانٌ in the first]: (ISk, Msb:) بائنة being here<br>\
used in the sense of a pass. part. n.: (S, Sgh,<br>\
Msb:) or it [is a possessive epithet, and thus]<br>\
means having separation: this kind of divorce is<br>\
one in the case of which the man cannot take<br>\
back the woman unless by a new contract; (TA;)<br>\
nor without her consent. (MF in art. بت.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
قَوْسٌ بَائِنَةٌ, (S, M, K,) and بَائِنٌ, (M, K,) A bow<br>\
that is widely separate from its string: (S, M,<br>\
K:) contr. of بَانِيَةٌ; (S, M;) this signifying one<br>\
that is so near to its string as almost to stick to<br>\
it: (S:) each of these denotes what is a fault.<br>\
(S, M.) ―<br>\
-b4-  بِئْرٌ بَائِنَةٌ: see بَيُونٌ. ―<br>\
-b5-  نَخْلَةٌ بَائِنَةٌ A<br>\
palm-tree of which the racemes have come forth<br>\
from the spathes, and of which the fruit-stalks<br>\
have grown long. (AHn, M.) ―<br>\
-b6-  البَائِنُ also signifies He who comes to the milch beast [meaning<br>\
the she-camel, when she is to be milked,] from her<br>\
left side; (S, K;) and المُعَلِّى, he who comes to<br>\
her from her right side: (S:) or the former, he<br>\
who stands on the right of the she-camel when she<br>\
is milked, and holds the milking-vessel, and raises<br>\
it to the milker, who stands on her left, and is<br>\
called المُسْتَعْلِى: (T:) two persons are engaged<br>\
in milking the she-camel; one of them holds the<br>\
milking-vessel on the right side, and the other<br>\
milks on the left side; and the milker is called<br>\
المُسْتَعْلِى and المُعَلِّى; and the holder, البائن:<br>\
(M:) pl. بُيَّنٌ. (T.) It is said in a prov., اِسْتُ<br>\
البَائِنِ أَعْرَفُ, or, as some say, أَعْلَمُ; meaning (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
who has superintended an affair, and exercised<br>\
himself diligently in the management thereof, is<br>\
better acquainted with it than he who has not done<br>\
this. (T. [See Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i. 606.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  طَوِيلٌ بَائِنٌ Excessively tall, far above the<br>\
stature of tall men. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also بَيِّنٌ.<br>\
طَلَبَ إِلَى أَبَوَيْهِ البَائِنَةَ He asked, or begged, of<br>\
his two parents, the separation of himself from<br>\
them, by [their giving him] property, (AZ, T,<br>\
M,) to be his alone. (T.)<br>\
أَبْيَنُ: see بَائِنٌ.<br>\
-A2-  فُلَانٌ أَبْيَنُ مِنْ فُلَانٍ Such<br>\
a one is more perspicuous, clear, distinct, chaste,<br>\
or eloquent, in speech or language, than such a<br>\
one. (S, TA.)<br>\
تِبْيَانٌ an anomalous inf. n. (T, S, K) of 2,<br>\
q. v.: (T:) or a subst. used as an inf. n.; (MF,<br>\
TA;) i. e., a subst. from 2. (Sb, M, TA.) See بَيَانٌ.<br>\
مُبَانٌ; and its fem., with ة: see بَائِنٌ, in three<br>\
places.<br>\
مُبِينٌ Separating, severing, disuniting, or cutting off; (S, K;) as also مُبْيِنٌ, like مُحْسِنٌ:<br>\
(K:) but [the right reading in the K may be<br>\
وَمُبِينٌ كَمُحْسِنٍ, meaning &quot;and مُبِينٌ is like<br>\
مُحْسِنٌ:&quot; if not,] مُبْيِنٌ is a mistake. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
See also بَيِّنٌ, in two places.<br>\
مَبَايِنُ الحَقِّ [in which the former word is app.<br>\
pl. of مُبِينَةٌ] signifies The things that make the<br>\
