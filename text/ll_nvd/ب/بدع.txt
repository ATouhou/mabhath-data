بَدَعَ, (K, TA,)<br>\

used than بَدَعَ. (TA.) You say, ابدع اللّٰهُ الخَلْقَ<br>\

on, by reason of fatigue, or of limping, or halting,<br>\
or slight lameness; as though she did a new and<br>\
unaccustomed thing: (TA:) or ابداع is not without limping, or halting, or slight lameness, (K,<br>\
TA,) accord. to certain of the Arabs of the desert;<br>\
but, says AO, this is not at variance with the<br>\
explanations given. (TA.) And أُبْدِعَ بِالرَّجُلِ The<br>\

to prosecute his journey; (K, TA;) and his beast<br>\
became so fatigued that it was left to remain<br>\
where it was; or stood still with him. (TA.)<br>\
[See also أُعْبِدَ بِهِ.] It is said in a proverb, إِذَا<br>\
طَلَبْتَ البَاطِلَ أُبْدِعَ بِكَ [When thou seekest what is<br>\
vain, or false, thou wilt be prevented from attaining thine object]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَبْدَعَ فُلَانٌ بِفُلَانٍ<br>\
(tropical:)  Such a one prevented such a one from attaining<br>\
his wish, (قَطَعَ بِهِ,) and abstained from aiding, or<br>\
assisting, him, and did not undertake the accomplishment of his want, (Lh, K, TA,) and was not<br>\

plea, &amp;c., was rendered vain, or ineffectual.<br>\
(Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, K, * TA.) أَبْدَعَ بِرُّهُ بِشُكْرِى وَفَضْلُهُ<br>\
وَ إيجَابُهُ بِوَصْفِى (assumed tropical:)  [His kindness has crippled my<br>\
power of thanking, and his bounty, and the obligation which he has imposed, my power of description]: so in the L; but in the O and K, قَصْدُهُ<br>\
[his intention] is put in the place of فضله; and in<br>\
the K, وايجابه is omitted: (TA:) said when one<br>\

-A3-  ابدعوا<br>\

5<br>\
تبدّع He turned innovator. (O, K.) Ru-beh<br>\
says,<br>\
أِنْ كُنْتَ لِلٰهِ التَّقِىَّ الأَطْوَعَا<br>\
فَلَيْسَ وَجْهَ الحَقِّ أَنْ تَبَدَّعَا<br>\
[If thou be, towards God, the pious, the very<br>\
obedient, it is not the right way that thou shouldst<br>\
turn innovator]. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\

[but generally used as an epithet in which the<br>\
quality of a subst. is predominant; signifying]<br>\
A novelty; or thing existing for the first time:<br>\
(K:) and i. q. ↓ بَدِيعٌ and ↓ مُبْتَدِعٌ, a first doer;<br>\
as though meaning one who has none among his<br>\
fellows to share, or participate, with him in a<br>\
thing, or an affair: (Msb:) pl. أَبْدَاعٌ. (Akh,<br>\
S.) You say, فُلَانٌ بِدْعٌ فِى هٰذا الأَمْرِ, (S, Msb,)<br>\
i. e. ↓ بَدِيعٌ, (S,) meaning Such a one is the first<br>\
doer in this affair; the first who has done it.<br>\
(Msb.) And hence the saying in the Kur [xlvi. 8],<br>\
قُلْ مَا كُنْتُ بِدْعًا مِنَ الرُّسُلِ (S, Msb, TA) Say<br>\
thou, I am not the first who has been sent of<br>\
the apostles: (Msb, TA:) or the meaning is, I<br>\
am not an innovator among the apostles; inviting<br>\
you to that to which they do not invite you; or<br>\
able to do that which they were not able to do:<br>\
and accord. to one reading, it is ↓ بِدَعًا; as being<br>\
[a sing. epithet] like قِيَمٌ; or for ذَا بِدَعٍ [in<br>\
which the latter word is pl. of بِدْعَةٌ]. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\

بِدْعَةٌ An innovation; a novelty; anything originated, invented, or innovated; anything made,<br>\
done, produced, caused to be or exist, or brought<br>\
into existence, newly, for the first time, it not<br>\
having been or existed before, and not after the<br>\
similitude of anything pre-existing: (ISK:) a<br>\
dissentient state or condition: (Msb:) a subst.<br>\
from اِبْتِدَاعٌ, like رِفْعَةٌ from اِرْتِفَاعٌ, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
and خِلْفَةٌ from اِخْتِلَافٌ: (Mgh:) subsequently<br>\
and generally applied to an addition, or an impairment, in religion: (Mgh, Msb:) or a novelty,<br>\
or an innovation, in religion, after the completion [thereof]: (S, K:) or an opinion declining,<br>\
or swerving, from the right way, and an action,<br>\
innovated after [the time of] the Prophet: (Lth,<br>\
K:) or an action at variance with the Sunneh:<br>\
(KT:) [generally a heretical innovation; or a<br>\
new heresy: but] there is a بدعة not disapproved,<br>\
termed بِدْعَةٌ مُبَاحَةٌ [an allowed, or allowable,<br>\
innovation]; which is that whereof the goodness<br>\
is attested by some principle in the law, or which<br>\
is required to prevent some cause of evil; such<br>\
as the Khaleefeh&#39;s seclusion of himself from the<br>\
promiscuous classes of the people: (Msb:) there<br>\
are two kinds of بدعة; namely بِدْعَةٌ هُدًى [an<br>\
innovation of a right kind], and بِدْعَةٌ ضَلَالٍ [an<br>\
innovation of an erroneous kind]. (IAth.)<br>\
بَدِيعٌ i. q. بِدْعٌ, which see in three places, (S,<br>\
Msb,) and ↓ مُبْتَدَعٌ; [i. e. Originated; invented;<br>\
innovated; made, done, produced, caused to be<br>\
or exist, or brought into existence, newly, for the<br>\
first time, not having been or existed before, and<br>\
not after the similitude of anything pre-existing;]<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) new; wonderful; unknown before.<br>\
(TA.) You say, جِئْتَ بِأَمْرٍ بَدِيعٍ Thou hast done<br>\
a new thing; a wonderful thing; a thing unknown<br>\
before: and ↓ أَمْرٌ بَادِعٌ signifies the same as أَمْرٌ<br>\
بَدِيعٌ. (TA.) And جَآءَ بِا لبَدِيعِ, (S,) or أَتَى<br>\
بِالبَدَيعِ, (K,) said of a poet, (S, K,) He produced<br>\
a new saying, or new poetry, not after the similitude of anything preceding. (TA.) And حَبْلٌ<br>\
بَدشيعٌ A new rope: (AHn:) or a rope begun to<br>\
be twisted, not being yet a rope, but undone, then<br>\
spun, then twisted again. (K.) And زِمَامٌ بَدِيعٌ<br>\
A new nose-rein of a camel. (TA.) And رَكِيَّةٌ<br>\
بَدِيعٌ A newly-dug well. (TA.) [See also بَدِىْءٌ.]<br>\
And بَدِيعٌ alone, A skin for wine &amp;c.: (S:) or<br>\
a new skin for wine &amp;c.: (K:) and a new skin<br>\
for water or milk: an epithet in which the<br>\
quality of a subst. is predominant. (TA.) Hence<br>\
the trad., إِنَّ تِهَامَةَ كَبَدِيعِ العَسَلِ حُلْوٌ أَوَّلُهُ حُلْوٌ<br>\
آخِرُهُ [Verily Tihámeh is like the skin, or new skin,<br>\
of honey: the first part thereof is sweet: the last<br>\
part thereof is sweet]: (S, K *:) because honey does<br>\
not change in flavour, whereas milk does change.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Fat; as an epithet: (As, K:) pl. بُدْعٌ.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. ↓ مُبْتَدِعٌ [An originator, inventor, or innovator; one who makes, does, produces, causes to be or exist, or brings into existence,<br>\
newly, for the first time, and not after the similitude of anything pre-existing]: (S, K:) of the<br>\
measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ,<br>\
like قَدِيرٌ in the sense of قَادِرٌ; from بَدَعَ. (TA.)<br>\
[See also بِدْعٌ.] You say, اَللّٰهُ بَدِيعٌ السَّمٰوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ<br>\
God is the Creator of the heavens and the earth,<br>\
not after the similitude of anything pre-existing.<br>\
(Aboo-Is-hák, S. *) And hence البَدِيعُ is a name<br>\
of God, meaning The Originator of the creation,<br>\
according to his own will, not after the similitude<br>\
of anything pre-existing. (TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
بَدِيعَةٌ A new, and an admirable, or a wonderful, thing; and especially such in speech, or<br>\
language, in poetry, and in answering, or replying:<br>\
pl. بَدَائِعُ: see an ex. voce بَدِيهَةٌ.]<br>\
