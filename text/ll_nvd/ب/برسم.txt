بُرْسِمَ He (a man) was affected with the<br>\
disease termed بِرْسَام; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) as<br>\
also بُلْسِمَ. (TA.)<br>\
بِرْسَامٌ, (in the T with fet-h, [بَرْسَامٌ,] Mgh,) A<br>\
certain malady, or disease, (S, Msb, K,) well<br>\
known, (S, Msb,) attended by delirium: (K:)<br>\
[in the present day, this term is applied to the<br>\
pleurisy, as also ذَاتُ الجَنْبِ; and so it is explained by Golius and Freytag; or, as the latter<br>\
adds, accord. to Avicenna, pleurodyne: but] in<br>\
some of the books of medicine, it is said to be<br>\
a tumour, (Msb,) or a hot tumour, (TA,) that<br>\
is incident to the septum which is between the<br>\
liver and the bowels, [app. meaning the upper<br>\
parts of the greater and lesser omentum,] and<br>\
then reaches to the brain: (Msb, TA:) also<br>\
pronounced بِلْسَامٌ: (ISk, Msb:) i. q. مُومٌ: (M,<br>\
TA:) it is an arabicized word; (IDrd, Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) or seems to be so; composed of بَرْ and<br>\
سَامْ; the former of these, in Persian, signifying<br>\
the “breast,” or “chest;” and the latter, “death”<br>\
[and “fire” and “a swelling;” of which three<br>\
meanings, the second and third are agreeable<br>\
with the two explanations of برسام given above]:<br>\
so says Az. (TA.)<br>\
بِرْسِيمٌ, with kesr, (K,) vulgarly pronounced<br>\
with fet-h to the ب, [بَرْسِيم,] (TA,) [Alexandrian trefoil or clover; trifolium Alexandrinum;<br>\
described by Forskål in his Flora Aegypt. Arab.<br>\
p. 139; the most common and the best kind of<br>\
succulent food for cattle grown in Egypt: it is<br>\
sown when the waters of the inundation are<br>\
leaving the fields; and yields three crops; the<br>\
second of which is termed رِبَّةٌ; and so is the<br>\
third; but this is generally left for seed: when<br>\
dry, it is termed دَرِيسٌ: if his words have not<br>\
been perverted by copyists, F explains it as] the<br>\
grain of the قُرْط, (حَبُّ القُرْط [but I think it<br>\
probable that this is a mistranscription, for خَيْرُ<br>\
القُرْطِ, i. e., the best of the (species of trefoil, or<br>\
clover, called) قُرْط,] resembling the رُطْبَة [or<br>\
رَطْبَة], or superior to this latter in size, or quality<br>\
(أَجَلُّ مِنْهَا): (K:) the قُرْط resembles the رُطْبَة,<br>\
[written in the TA without the vowel signs,]<br>\
but is superior to this latter in size, or quality<br>\
(اجلّ منها), and larger in the leaves, and is what<br>\
is called in Persian شَبْذَر [or شَبْدَر]: (AHn, TA:)<br>\
it is one of the best kinds of herbage for horses<br>\
and the like, which fatten upon it. (TA.)<br>\
إِبْرِيسَمٌ, (M, [and thus written in copies of the<br>\
K,]) with kesr to the ر [as well as the ء], accord.<br>\
to IAar, (M,) [and] with fet-h to the س; (K;)<br>\
or إِبْرَيْسَمٌ; (M;) and [app. إِبْرِيسُمٌ,] with damm<br>\
to the س; (K;) or it has three dial. forms;<br>\
accord. to ISk, it is ابريسِم [app. إِبْرِيسِمٌ]; others<br>\
say that it is ابريسَم [app. أَبْرَيْسَمٌ], with fet-h;<br>\
IAar says that it is إِبْرِيسَمٌ, with kesr to the ء<br>\
and the ر and with fet-h to the س, and he says<br>\
that there is not in the language an instance of<br>\
إِفْعِيلِلٌ, with kesr, but there are instances of<br>\
إِفْعِيلَلٌ, as إِهْلِيلَجٌ [q. v.] and إِبْرِيسَمٌ; (S; [but<br>\
I find that in two copies of that work, and in<br>\
the L, this passage is mutilated; for it runs thus;<br>\
“ISk says that it is إِبْرِيسَمٌ, with kesr to the ء<br>\
and ر, and with fet-h to the س,” &amp;c.;]) or one<br>\
of its dial. forms is إِبْرِيسِمٌ, with kesr to the ء and<br>\
the ر and the س; but ISk disallows this, [or,<br>\
probably, as appears from what has been said<br>\
above, we should read here, “accord. to ISk,<br>\
but others disallow this,”] saying that there is<br>\
not in the language an instance of افعليل with<br>\
kesr to the [former] ل, but with fet-h, as إِهْلِيلَجٌ<br>\
and إطْرِيفَلٌ; and the second form is أَبْرَيْسَمٌ, with<br>\
fet-h to those three letters; and the third is<br>\
إِبْرَيْسَمٌ, with kesr to the ء, and fet-h to the ر<br>\
and the س; (Msb;) and IB [appears to indicate<br>\
the second and third of these forms, for he] says<br>\
that some pronounce ابريسم with fet-h to the<br>\
ء and the ر, and some pronounce it with kesr to<br>\
the ء, and with fet-h to the س; (TA;) Silk;<br>\
syn. حَرِيرٌ: (M, K:) or, accord. to some, specially, raw silk: (TA:) [it is said that] حرير<br>\
is the same as ابريسم: (Msb in art. حر:) or<br>\
dressed silk; syn. ابريسم مَطْبُوخ: (Mgh and<br>\
Msb in that art.:) or stuff wholly composed of<br>\
silk: or of which the woof is silk: (Mgh in that<br>\
art., from the Jema et-Tefáreek:) [and it is also<br>\
said that] قَزَّ is the same as ابريسم: (K in art.<br>\
قز:) or a kind thereof: (S in that art.:) or that<br>\
whereof ابريسم is made: (Lth, Az, Msb, TA, all<br>\
in that art.:) [medicinal properties are ascribed<br>\
to it: it is said that] it is exhilarating, warming to<br>\
the body, moderate in temperament, and strengthening to the sight when used as a collyrium:<br>\
(K:) the word is arabicized, (S, Msb, K, [but<br>\
in the last it is said, after the explanation of the<br>\
meaning, “or it is arabicized,”]) from [the Persian] ابريشم [i. e. أَبْرِيشَمْ]: (TA:) and is perfectly decl., even if used as a proper name, in the<br>\
manner of a surname, because it was arabicized<br>\
in its indeterminate state, not like إِسْحَاقُ &amp;c.,<br>\
which were arabicized in their determinate state,<br>\
and are not used by the Arabs indeterminately.<br>\
(S.)<br>\
إِبْرِسَمِىٌّ or إِبْرَيْسَمِىٌّ [&amp;c.] A manufacturer<br>\
[or seller] of ابريسم. (TA.)<br>\
مُبَرْسَمٌ A man affected with the disease termed<br>\
بِرْسَام; (Mgh, Msb, K;) as also مُبَلْسَمٌ. (Msb,<br>\
