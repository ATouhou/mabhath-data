بُلُوغٌ [inf. n. of بَلَغَ] and إِبْلَاغٌ [inf. n. of<br>\
↓ ابلغ, but it seems that ابلاغ is here a mistranscription for بَلَاغٌ, which is, like بُلُوغٌ, an inf. n.<br>\
of بَلَغَ, and this observation will be found to be<br>\
confirmed by a statement immediately following<br>\
this sentence,] signify The reaching, attaining,<br>\
arriving at, or coming to, the utmost point of<br>\
that to which, or towards which, one tends or<br>\
repairs or betakes himself, to which one directs<br>\
his course, or which one seeks, pursues, endeavours<br>\
to reach, desires, intends, or purposes; whether<br>\
it be a place, or a time, or any affair or state<br>\
or event that is meditated or intended or determined or appointed: and sometimes, the being<br>\
at the point thereof: so says Abu-1-Kásim in the<br>\
Mufradát. (TA: [in which it is said, in the<br>\
supplement to the present art., that بَلَاغٌ signifies<br>\
The reaching, attaining, arriving at, or coming<br>\
to, a thing.]) You say, بَلَغَ المَكَانَ, (S, K,) and<br>\
المَنْزِلَ, (Msb,) [aor.<br>\
بَلُغَ,] inf. n. بُلُوغٌ (S, K) [and<br>\
بَلَاغٌ, as shown above], He reached, attained,<br>\
arrived at, or came to, (S, Msb, K,) the place,<br>\
(S, K,) and the place of abode: (Msb:) and (so in<br>\
the S, but in the K “ or,”) he was, or became,<br>\
at the point of reaching it, attaining it, &amp;c. (S,<br>\
K.) فَبَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَ, in the Kur [ii. 232], means<br>\
And they have fully attained, or ended, their<br>\
term. (Msb.) But فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ, in the same<br>\
[lxv. 2], means And when they are near to attaining, or ending, their term: (S, TA:) or are<br>\
at the point of accomplishing their term. (Msb,<br>\
TA.) It has the first of the meanings explained<br>\
above in the phrase, بَلَغَ أَشُدَّهُ [Kur xii. 22 &amp;c.,<br>\
He attained his manly vigour, or full maturity,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (TA.) And in بَلَغَأَرْبَعِينَ سَنَةً [Kur xlvii. 14,<br>\
He attained the age of forty years]. (TA.) And<br>\
in بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ [Kur xxxvii. 100, He attained<br>\
to working with him]. (TA.) In the Kur [iii. 35],<br>\
occurs the phrase, وَقَدْ بَلَغَنِىَ الكِبَرُ [When old age<br>\
hath come to me, or overtaken me]: and in another<br>\
place [xix. 9], وَ قَدْ بَلَغْتُ مِنَ الكِبَرِ عُتِيًّا [And I<br>\
have reached the extreme degree of old age: so<br>\
explained in the Expos. of the Jel]: phrases like<br>\
أَدْرَكَنِىَ الجَهْدُ and أَدْرَكْتُهُ. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
You say also, مَا بَلَغَ ↓ لَزِمَهُ ذٰلِكَ بَالِغًا with the<br>\
accus. case as a denotative of state; meaning<br>\
[That clave to him, or adhered to him, &amp;c.,]<br>\
rising to its highest degree or point; from بَلَغَ<br>\
المَنْزِلَ, explained above. (Msb.) [But مَا بَلَغَ ↓ بَالِغًا<br>\
more frequently means Whatever point, degree,<br>\
amount, sum, quantity, number, or the like, it<br>\
may reach, attain, arrive at, come to, or amount<br>\
to.] And ↓ بَلَغَ فُلَانٌ مَبْلَغَهُ and ↓ مَبْلَغَتُهُ [Such<br>\
a one reached, or attained, his utmost point or<br>\
scope or degree]. (TA.) And ↓ بَلَغَ فِى العِلْمِ المَبَالِغَ<br>\
[He attained, in knowledge, or science, the utmost<br>\
degrees of proficiency]. (TA.) And بَلَغَ فِى<br>\
↓ الجَوْدَةِ مَبْلَغًا [It reached a consummate degree<br>\
in goodness]. (S, K, * TA.) And بَلَغَ مِنَ الجَوْدَةِ<br>\
↓ مَبْلَغًا [He attained a consummate degree of goodliness]: said of a boy that has attained to puberty.<br>\
(O, TA.) And بَلَغَ غَايَتَهُ فِى الطَّلَبِ [He did his<br>\
utmost, or used his utmost power or ability, in<br>\
seeking to attain an object]. (Msb in art. جهد.)<br>\
And بَلَغَ أَقْصَى مَجْهُودِ بَعِيرِهِ فِى السَّيْرِ [He exerted<br>\
the utmost endeavour, or effort, or power, or<br>\
strength, of his camel, in journeying]. (S in art.<br>\
نكث.) And بَلَغَ جَهْدَ دَابَّتِهِ i. q. جَهَدَهَا [He jaded,<br>\
harassed, distressed, fatigued, or wearied, his beast]:<br>\
(K in art. جهد:) and in like manner, بَلَغَ مَشَقَّتَهُ<br>\
and بَلَغَ مِنْهُ المَشَقَّةَ i. q. جَهَدَهُ [and شَقَّ عَلَيْهِ, i. e.<br>\
He, or it, jaded him, harassed him, &amp;c.; ditressed him, afflicted him, oppressed him, overpowered him: thus in each of these instances, as<br>\
in many similar cases, the verb with the inf. n.<br>\
that follows is equivalent to the verb of that<br>\
inf. n.]. (Msb in art. جهد.) [And, elliptically,<br>\
بَلَغَ مِنْهُ i. q. بَلَغَ مِنْهُ المشَقَّةَ , explained above:<br>\
and often meaning It took, or had, an effect upon<br>\
him; it affected him: frequently said of wine and<br>\
the like: and of a saying; as in the Ksh and<br>\
Bd in iv. 66, where يَبْلُغُ مِنْهُمْ is followed by<br>\
وَيُؤَثِرُ فِيهِ as an explicative: see also بَلِيغٌ.] And<br>\
بَلَغْتَ مِنَّا البُلَغِينَ, (S, K,) and البِلَغِينَ, and كُلَّ<br>\
مَبْلَغٍ: (K:) see البُلَغِينَ below. And بَلَغْتُ مِنَ<br>\
الأَمْرِ المَشَقَّةَ [I experienced distress from the<br>\
affair, or event]. (TA in art. مض.) [See also<br>\
an ex. voce إِبِدٌ. بَلَغَنِى also signifies It has come<br>\
to my knowledge, or been related to me, or been<br>\
told me; or it came to my knowledge, &amp;c.: and<br>\
in this case it is generally followed by أَنَّ, or by<br>\
أَنْ as a contraction of أَنَّ: for exs., see these two<br>\
particles. And in like manner, بَلَغَنِى عَنْهُ Information has come to me, or information came to me,<br>\
from him, or concerning him, that such a thing has<br>\
happened, or had happened.] And بَلَغَ said of a<br>\
letter or writing, inf. n. بَلَاغٌ and بُلُوغٌ, It reached,<br>\
arrived, or came. (Msb.) And said of a plant,<br>\
or of herbage, It attained its full growth: (TA:)<br>\
and of a tree, such as a palm-tree &amp;c., its fruit<br>\
became ripe: (AHn, TA:) and of fruit, it became<br>\
ripe. (Msb.) Also, said of a boy, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
بَلُغَ, inf. n. بُلُوغٌ, or, as IKoot says, بَلَاغٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) He attained to puberty, virility, ripeness,<br>\
or maturity; syn. أَدْرَكَ, (T, S, Msb, K,) and<br>\
اِحْتَلَمَ; (M, Msb;) and attained a consummate<br>\
degree of goodliness (بَلَغَ مِنَ الجَوْدَةِ مَبْلَغًا): (O,<br>\
TA:) as though he attained the time of the writing<br>\
of his marriage-contract, and of his having duties<br>\
or obligations imposed upon him: (TA:) and<br>\
in like manner one says of a girl, بَلَغَ, (T, TA,)<br>\
or بَلَغَتْ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بَلَغَ اللّٰهُ بِهِ [God caused him<br>\
to reach, attain, arrive at, or come to, his appointed<br>\
end, or term of life; أَجَلَهُ, or the like, being understood]. (TA.) You say, بَلَغَ اللّٰهُ بِكَ أَكْلَأَ العُمُرِ,<br>\
i. e. [May God cause thee to reach, or attain,]<br>\
the extreme, or most distant, period of life! (S<br>\
and TA in art. كلأ.) And فَعَلْتُ بِهِ مَا بَلَغَ بِهِ<br>\
الأَذَى وَ المَكْرُوهْ [I did with him that which caused<br>\
him to come to what was annoying, or hurtful, and<br>\
evil]. (TA.) And بَلَغَ بِهِ البِلَغِينَ: see the last word<br>\
of this phrase below. ―<br>\
-b3-  بُلِغَ, like عُنِىَ, He (a<br>\
man) was, or became, jaded, harasssed, distressed,<br>\
fatigued, or wearied. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  بَلُغَ, [aor.<br>\
بَلُغَ,] (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) inf. n. بَلَاغَةٌ, (S, Msb,) He was, or<br>\
became بَلِيغ, i. e. فَصِيح [more properly signifying chaste, or perspicuous, in speech, but here<br>\
meaning eloquent]; (S, * Msb, K;) and sharp,<br>\
or penetrating, or effective, in tongue; (Msb;)<br>\
attaining, by his speech, or diction, the utmost<br>\
scope of his mind and desire. (K, * TA.) The<br>\
difference between بَلَاغَةٌ and فَصَاحَةٌ is this: that<br>\
the latter is an attribute of a single word and of<br>\
speech and of the speaker; but the former is an<br>\
attribute only of speech and the speaker: (Kull:)<br>\
بلاغة in the speaker is A faculty whereby one is<br>\
enabled to compose language suitable to the exigency of the case, i. e., to the occasion of speaking<br>\
[or writing], with chasteness, or perspicuity, or<br>\
eloquence, thereof: in language, it is suitableness<br>\
to the exigency of the case, i. e., to the occasion<br>\
of speaking [or writing], with chasteness or perspicuity, or eloquence, thereof. (KT.)<br>\
2<br>\
تَبْلِيغٌ and ↓ إِبْلَاغٌ [inf. ns. of بلّغ and ابلغ]<br>\
signify The causing to reach, attain, arrive, or<br>\
come; bringing, conveying, or delivering: (S, K,<br>\
TA:) the former is the more common. (Er-Rághib, TA.) [You say, بلّغهُ المَكَانَ He caused<br>\
him, or it, to reach, attain, arrive at, or come to,<br>\
the place. And بلّغهُ مَقْصُودَهُ He caused him to<br>\
attain his object of aim or endeavour &amp;c.] And<br>\
بَلَّغْتُ الرِّسَالَةَ [I brought, conveyed, or delivered,<br>\
the message]. (S.) And بلّغهُ السَّلَامَ, (Msb,) and<br>\
الخَبَرَ, (TA,) as also ↓ ابلغهُ, (Msb, TA,) He<br>\
brought, conveyed, delivered, or communicated, to<br>\
him the salutation, (Msb,) and he brought, &amp;c., or<br>\
told, to him the news, or information. (TA.) [And<br>\
بَلَّغَنِى عَنْ فُلَانٍ He told me from such a one, or<br>\
on the part of such a one, some piece of information, or that some event had happened, &amp;c.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
بلّغ الفَارِسُ, (S, A, K,) inf. n. تَبْلِيغٌ, (K,) The<br>\
horseman stretched forth, or extended, his hand,<br>\
or arm, with the rein of his horse, [or gave the<br>\
rein to his horse,] in order that he might increase<br>\
in his running. (S, A, K.)<br>\
-A3-  بلّغ الشَّيْبُ فِى رَأْسِهِ<br>\
Hoariness began to appear on his head; accord.<br>\
to IAar; as also بلّع, with the unpointed ع: the<br>\
Basrees assert that the former is a mistranscription; but it is related as heard from Th, by Aboo-Bekr Es-Soolee. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
بالغ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. مُبَالَغَةٌ (JK,<br>\
K, &amp;c.) and بِلَاغٌ, (K.) He exceeded the usual,<br>\
or ordinary, or the just, or proper, bounds, or<br>\
degree, in a thing; acted egregiously, or immoderately, or extravagantly, therein: (KL:) he<br>\
strove, or laboured; exerted himself, or his power<br>\
or efforts or endeavours or ability; employed<br>\
himself vigorously, strenuously, laboriously, sedulously, earnestly, with energy or effectiveness;<br>\
took pains, or extraordinary pains: (K, TA:)<br>\
he did not fall short of doing what was requisite,<br>\
or what he ought; did not flag, or was not<br>\
remiss: (S, K, TA:) he exerted unsparingly his<br>\
power or ability, or effort or endeavour, or the<br>\
utmost thereof: (Msb:) he accomplished, or did,<br>\
or attained, the utmost of his power or ability, or<br>\
effort or endeavour; he did his utmost: (JK:)<br>\
فِى أَمْرٍ [in an affair]: (S, K, TA:) or فِى كَذَا,<br>\
meaning in the pursuit of such a thing. (Msb.)<br>\
[<br>\
بالغ فِى كَذَا may be rendered as above, or He<br>\
did such a thing much, exceedingly, egregiously,<br>\
extraordinarily, immoderately, extravagantly,<br>\
excessively, vehemently, energetically, superlatively, excellently, consummately, thoroughly.<br>\
Hence مُبَالَغَةٌ in explanations of words; meaning<br>\
Intensiveness; muchness; extraordinariness; excessiveness; vehemence; energy; emphasis; hyperbole; &amp;c.; and sometimes, frequentative signification. Thus, إِسْمُ مُبَالَغَةٍ means A noun of<br>\
intensiveness; or an intensive epithet: as شَكُورٌ<br>\
“ very thankful,” or “ very grateful; ” and حَمَّادٌ<br>\
“ a great praiser,” or “ a frequent praiser. ”]<br>\
4<br>\
ابلغ, inf. n. إِبْلَاغٌ: see 2, in two places.<br>\
[Hence,] ابلغ الأَمْرَ جَهْدَهُ [He brought his utmost<br>\
power or ability, or effort or endeavour, to the<br>\
performance, or accomplishment, of the affair].<br>\
(TA.) And أَبْلَغْتُ إِلَيْهِ i. e. فَعَلْتُ بِهِ مَا بَلَغَ بِهِ<br>\
الأَذَى وَ المَكْرُوهَ [I did with him that which caused<br>\
him to come to what was annoying, or hurtful,<br>\
and evil]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, first sentence;<br>\
where it is said that إِبْلَاغٌ is syn. with بُلُوغٌ; but<br>\
this is app. a mistake.<br>\
-A3-  [مَا أَبْلَغَهُ, and أَبْلِغْ بِهِ,<br>\
How eloquent is he !].<br>\
5<br>\
تبلّغ المَنْزِلَ He constrained himself to reach,<br>\

-b2-  تبلّغ بِهِ<br>\
He was satisfied, or content, with it, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) and attained his desire [thereby]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\

him; afflicted him; became vehement, or severe,<br>\
in him. (S, Z, Sgh, K.)<br>\
6<br>\

utmost effect in the skin. (AHn.) And تبالغ فِيهِ<br>\
الهَّمُ, and المَرَضَ, Anxiety, or disquietude of mind,<br>\
or grief, attained its utmost degree in him, and so<br>\
disease, or the disease. (TA.) [This verb seems<br>\
properly to signify It reached, or attained, by<br>\
degrees.]<br>\
-A2-  تبالغ فِى كَلَامِهِ He affected eloquence<br>\
(بَلَاغَة) in his speech, not being of those characterized thereby: [whence] one says, مَا هُوَ بِبَلِيغٍ<br>\
وَلٰكِنْ يَتَبَالِغُ [He is not eloquent, but he affects<br>\
eloquence]. (TA.)<br>\

بَلْغَةٌ: see بِلْغٌ.<br>\
بُلْغَةٌ A sufficiency of the means of subsistence,<br>\
(T, S, Msb, K,) such that nothing remains over<br>\
and above it: (T, Msb:) and simply a sufficiency;<br>\
enough; (JK, Msb, TA;) as also ↓ بَلَاغٌ, (JK, S,<br>\
Msb, K,) meaning a thing that suffices, or contents, and enables one to attain what he seeks;<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ تَبَلُّغٌ. (JK, Msb, TA.) You say,<br>\
فِى هٰذَا بُلْغَةٌ, and ↓ بَلَاغٌ, and ↓ تَبَلُّغٌ, In this is a<br>\
sufficiency, or enough. (Msb, TA.) And it is<br>\
said in the Kur [xxi. 106], لِقَوْمٍ ↓ إِنَّ فِى هٰذَا لَبَلَاغًا<br>\
عَابِدِينَ Verily in this is a sufficiency [for a people<br>\
serving God]: (Bd, TA:) or a means of attaining<br>\
the object sought after, or desired. (Bd.)<br>\
بِلَغْنٌ: see بَلَاغَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also A calumniator, or<br>\

البُلَغِينَ, (S,) or البِلَغِينَ, (JK,) or both, (K,)<br>\
Calamity, misfortune, or disaster: (S, K:) or<br>\

us, in the utmost degree]: (K:) it is said to mean<br>\
that the war harassed her, and distressed her in<br>\
the utmost degree. (TA.) It is like البُرَحِينَ<br>\
[and البِرَحِينَ] and الأَطْوَرِينَ; all meaning calamities, misfortunes, or disasters: (A&#39;Obeyd, TA:)<br>\
and is as though they said خَطْبٌ بِلَغٌ [and بُلَغٌ],<br>\
meaning بَلِيغٌ, and then formed the pl. thus because they considered calamities [as personified,<br>\
i. e.,] as rational beings having purpose, or design.<br>\
(IAth, TA.) It is invariably thus, terminating<br>\
with ى and ن: or one may say in the nom. case<br>\
البُلَغُونَ, and in the accus. and gen. البُلَغِينَ. (O,<br>\
K. *) You say also, بَلَغَ بِهِ البِلَغِينَ [lit. He caused<br>\
him to come, i. e. he brought him, to calamity,<br>\
misfortune, or disaster, or to distress, or affliction]; meaning he went to the utmost point in<br>\

(IAar, TA.)<br>\
بَلَاغٌ is a subst. from تَبْلِيغٌ and إِبْلَاغٌ, meaning<br>\

said, كُلُّ رَافِعَةٍ رَفَعَتْ إِلَيْنَا مِنَ البَلَاغِ, [in the CK<br>\

announced, (مَا بَلَغَ,) of the Kur-án and of the<br>\
[statutes, or ordinances, &amp;c., termed] سُنَن: or<br>\
the meaning is, مِنْ ذَوِى البَلَاغِ, i. e., التَّبْلِيغِ, [of<br>\
those who have the office of communicating, or<br>\
announcing,] the simple subst. being put in the<br>\
place of the inf. n.: (K, TA:) but some relate it<br>\
differently, saying ↓ مِنَ البُلَّاغِ [of the communicators, or announcers,] like حُدَّاث in the sense of<br>\
مُحَدِّثُون: (TA:) and some say, ↓ مِنَ البِلَاغِ,<br>\
meaning مِنَ المُبَالِغِينَ فِى التَّبْلِيغِ, i. e. of those<br>\
who do their utmost in communicating, or announcing. (Hr, K.) [See this trad. cited and<br>\
explained more fully in the first paragraph of art.<br>\

(JK:) the pl. of بَلِيغٌ is بُلَغَآءُ. (TA.) Applied<br>\
