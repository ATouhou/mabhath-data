also 3.] ―<br>\
-b2-  يُبِدُّهُمْ is used by a poet, referring to<br>\
a saying, and is explained by IAar as meaning<br>\
It (the saying) shall be distributed among them<br>\
(يُفَّرقُ فِيهِمْ); opposed to يَجْمَعُ [i. e. يَجْمَعُهُمْ;<br>\
which shows that the former means it shall be<br>\
addressed to them one by one, or separately]. (M,<br>\
TA. [The author of the former adds, “I know<br>\
not, in discourse, أَبْدَدْتُهُ as meaning فَرَّقْتُهُ: ” but<br>\
this is not what I Aar means.]) ―<br>\

ابتدّاهُ بِاالضَّرْبِ They two took him on both<br>\
sides of him, (T, S, K,) or came to him on both<br>\
sides of him, (K,) with beating. (T, S.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
السَّبُعَانِ يَبْتَدَّانِ الرَّجُلَ The two wild beasts come<br>\
upon both sides of the man. (S, A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  الرَّضِيعَانِ<br>\

their mother on either side, one from one breast<br>\

predominance, or control, over his affair, so that<br>\
people would not hear [or obey] any other. (A.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., كُنَّا نَرَي أَنَّ لَنَافِىِ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ<br>\
حَقَّا فَاسْتَبَدْتُمْ عَلَيْنَا [We used to opine that we had<br>\

K:) or there is no artifice whereby one may<br>\
avoid it, or escape from it: (M, K:) or there<br>\
is no avoiding it: (Msb:) it is absolutely necessary: it is not possible to separate oneself from<br>\
it, nor is there anything that can serve in its<br>\
stead. (TA.) And مَا لَكَ مِنْهُ بُدٌّ [Thou hast not<br>\
any means, or way, of separating thyself from<br>\
it, or avoiding it]. (M, L.) And لَيْسَ لِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ<br>\
بُدٌّ There is no artifice for this affair. (T.) [It<br>\
is also said, with reference to the first of these<br>\
phrases, that] بُدٌّ signifies Amplitude; from أَبَدُّ<br>\
meaning “ wide between the legs. ” (Ham p. 348.)<br>\

or set portion; (T, S, M, A, IAth, K;) of anything: (M, K:) [or] the last signifies a piece, or<br>\
portion, separated, disunited, or dispersed: (Ham<br>\

to have this signification. (S.) [In the copies of the<br>\

said in the TA to be a mistake.]<br>\
-A3-  بُدٌّ is also an<br>\

جَآءَتِ الخَيْلُ بَدَادِ; (T, S;) in which بداد is<br>\
indecl., with kesr for its termination because it<br>\
deviates from its original form, i. e., the inf. n.<br>\
بَدَدٌ; and it is indecl. because it deviates from its<br>\
original form and is of the fem. gender and has<br>\
the quality of an epithet; for two of these causes<br>\
render it imperfectly decl., and the three render<br>\
it indecl.; (S;) or بَدَادِ بَدَادِ, and بَدَادَ بَدَادَ, (Lh,<br>\

you his adversary, or opponent [with whom to<br>\
fight]. (As, T, S, K. *) Here بداد is indecl.,<br>\
with kesr for its termination, because it is an<br>\
imperative verbal noun, and the imperative is<br>\
alike uninfluenced with respect to its termination<br>\
by any governing word; and it is said to be with<br>\
kesr because two quiescent letters would otherwise occur together, [and] because it occupies the<br>\
place of an imperative verb [which in like manner<br>\
is terminated with kesr when it is necessary to<br>\
prevent the occurrence of two quiescent letters<br>\
together]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  With the article, you say,<br>\

the part of the horseman&#39;s thigh that is next the<br>\
saddle: (T, M, A, L:) or the part between the<br>\
legs: (M, L:) the inner sides of the two thighs<br>\
are called the بَادَّانِ, (S,) because the saddle separates them; (IAar, M;) and if so, بَادٌّ is of the<br>\
measure فَاعِلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ;<br>\
or it may be a possessive epithet [meaning ذُو بَدٍّ].<br>\
(M, L.) You say, هُوَ حَسَنُ البَادِّ عَلَى السَّرجِ, meaning He is a good rider upon the saddle. (A.) ―<br>\

is incorrect, and should be thus,<br>\
بَدَّآءُ تَمْشِى مِشْيَةَ الأَبَدِّ<br>\
[A woman of large make, walking in the manner<br>\
of the man of large make; or a woman wide<br>\
between the thighs, &amp;c.]; (K;) for it is descriptive<br>\
of a woman, as IB and Aboo-Sahl El-Harawee<br>\
have observed before the author of the K. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also A horse [or any quadruped (see بَدَّ)]<br>\
having the fore legs far apart: (M, K:) or<br>\
having the fore legs far from the sides: (TA:) or<br>\
wide between the legs: (Ham p. 348:) and a<br>\
camel having the elbows far from the sides: (TA:)<br>\
and the fem. بَدَّآءُ, a cow having her fore legs far<br>\
apart. (S.) [Hence,] الأَبَدُّ الزَّنِيمُ [in the CK الرَّثِيمُ]<br>\
The lion; (M, K;) the former epithet being<br>\
applied to him because his fore legs are far apart,<br>\
and the latter because he is [often] alone. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  كَتِفٌ بَدَّآءُ A broad shoulder-blade, the sides<br>\
of which are distant, one from another. (M, L.)<br>\
طَيْرٌ أَبَادِيدُ, (Fr, S, K,) and ↓ تَبَادِيدُ, (K, TA,)<br>\
[in the CK نَبادِيدُ,] erroneously written by J<br>\
↓ يَبَادِيدُ, (K,) [but see what follows; like أَنَادِيدُ<br>\
and يَنَادِيدُ;] Birds in a state of dispersion. (S,<br>\
K.) In the following verse of &#39;Otárid Ibn-Kurrán,<br>\
quoted by J,<br>\
كَأَنَّمَا أَهُلُ حَجْرٍ يَنْظُرُونَ مَتَى<br>\
يَرَوْنَنِى خَارِجًا طَيْرٌ يَبَادِيدُ<br>\
[As though the people of Hajr, watching when<br>\
they should see me going forth, were birds in a<br>\
state of dispersion], (K,) thus related also by<br>\
Yaakoob, and thus in the handwriting of Az,<br>\
(TA,) the last two words should be طَيْرُ اليَنَادِيدِ,<br>\
the latter with ن, and governed by the former in<br>\
the gen. case, the rhyme being with kesr: (K:)<br>\
so says Aboo-Sahl El-Harawee. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ذَهَبُوا<br>\
أَبَادِيدُ, (M, K,) and ↓ تَبَادِيدُ, (K,) or ↓ يَبَادِيدُ, (as<br>\
in the T, from Fr, and in the M and L, and in<br>\
some copies of the K, [but see above,]) [as also<br>\
أَنَادِيدُ, and يَنَادِيدُ, or تَنَادِيدُ,] They went away in<br>\
a state of dispersion. (M, L, K.)<br>\
تَبَادِيدُ: see أَبَادِيدُ, in two places.<br>\
مُبِدٌّ [act. part. n. of 4, q. v.]. The following<br>\
words of &#39;Omar Ibn-Abee-Rabee&#39;ah,<br>\
أَمُبِدٌّ سُؤَالَكَ العَالَمِينَ<br>\
are said to signify Dost thou distribute thy petition<br>\
among mankind one by one, so as to include them<br>\
universally? or dost thou constrain them by thy<br>\
petition? from the saying, مَا لَكَ مِنْهُ بُدٌّ [“ thou<br>\
hast no means,” or “ way,” “ of separating thyself<br>\
from it,” or “ avoiding it ”]. (M, L.)<br>\
شَمْلٌ مُبَدَّدٌ [A united state of affairs]. become<br>\
disunited [or discomposed or disorganized]. (S, L.)<br>\
اِمْرَأَةٌ مُتَبَدِّدَةٌ An emaciated woman, [as though]<br>\
having one part far from another. (M, L.)<br>\
يَبَادِيدُ: see أَبَادِيدُ, in two places.<br>\
