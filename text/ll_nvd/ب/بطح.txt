of these, and the second also, contr. to analogy,<br>\
being pls. of ابطح; (S;) or both are pls. of بطحآء,<br>\
contr. to analogy; (Ham p. 251;) or the first is<br>\
pl. of ابطح, formed after the manner of the pl.<br>\
of a subst. of this measure, though the sing. is<br>\
originally an epithet; (M, TA;) and the second,<br>\
as is asserted by more than one, is correctly pl.<br>\
of بطحآء, as is also بَطْحَاوَاتٌ; (TA;) and the<br>\
third is pl. of بطيحة. (M, TA.)<br>\
