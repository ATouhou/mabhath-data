بَضَعَهُ, (S, Msb,) aor.<br>\
بَضَعَ, (Msb,) inf. n. بَضْعٌ,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) He cut it; (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K;) namely, flesh, or flesh-meat: (S, TA:) and<br>\
it (a sword) cut a piece off from it; namely, a<br>\
thing: (As, S:) and he cut it in pieces; namely,<br>\
flesh, or flesh-meat: (K, TA:) and ↓ بضّعهُ, inf. n.<br>\
تَبْضِيعٌ, has the first of these significations: (K:<br>\
[but only the inf. n. is there mentioned:]) or this<br>\
latter signifies he cut it much, or in several pieces,<br>\
or in many pieces. (Msb, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  He slit it;<br>\
or cut it lengthwise; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) namely,<br>\
flesh, or flesh-meat, (Msb,) or a wound, (S, TA,)<br>\
and a vein, and a hide. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence,]<br>\
بَضَعَهَا, (Sb, Msb, TA,) aor.<br>\
بَضَعَ, (Msb,) inf. n. بَضْعٌ<br>\
(K, TA) and بُضْعٌ, like شُكْرٌ and شُغْلٌ and كُفْرٌ, for<br>\
فُعْلٌ is not rare as a measure of inf. ns., (Sb, TA,)<br>\
or accord. to some it is an inf. n. of this verb,<br>\
(Msb,) but accord. to others it is a simple subst.,<br>\
(TA,) (tropical:)  Inivit eam; he lay with her, or compressed<br>\
her; (Sb, Msb, K, TA;) as also ↓ باضعها, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. مُبَاضَعَةٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and بِضَاعٌ: (S,<br>\
Msb, K:) because in the act which it signifies is<br>\
a kind of slitting. (Mgh.) You say, مَلَكَ بُضْعَهَا,<br>\
i. e. جِمَاعَهَا. (Msb.) And it is said in a prov.,<br>\
↓ كَمُعَلِّمَةِ أُمَّهَا البِضَاعَ (tropical:)  [Like her who teaches her<br>\
mother المُجَامَعَة]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  بَضْعٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The<br>\
taking in marriage: (K, TA:) and بُضْعٌ, as an<br>\
inf. n., (assumed tropical:)  The making a contract of marriage.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\

ابضعها, (Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِبْضَاعٌ,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) (tropical:)  He gave her in marriage. (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K.) It is said in a trad., (TA,) تُسْتَأْمَرُ<br>\
النِّسَآءُ فِى إِبْضَاعِهِنَّ (tropical:)  Women shall be consulted<br>\
respecting the giving them in marriage: (T,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, TA:) or, accord. to one relation,<br>\
↓ أَبْضَاعِهِنَّ, (Mgh, Msb,) which [virtually] means<br>\
the same; (Msb;) but this is a pl., namely, of<br>\
بُضْعٌ. (Mgh, Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  ابضع الشَّىْءَ He made the<br>\
thing to be بِضَاعَة [i. e. an article of merchandise], (S, K, TA,) whatever it was; (TA;) as<br>\
also ↓ استبضعهُ: (S, K:) or الشَّىْءَ ↓ اِسْتَبْضَعْتُ signifies I made [or took] the thing as بضاعة [an<br>\
article of merchandise] for myself: and you say,<br>\
أَبْضَعْتُهُ غَيْرِى [I made it, or gave it as, an article<br>\
of merchandise to another than me]: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) and ابضعهُ البِضَاعَةَ he gave him the article<br>\
of merchandise. (TA.) Hence the phrase, in a<br>\
trad. relating to El-Medeeneh, accord. to one<br>\
relation, تُبْضِعُ طِيبَهَا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  It gives the good<br>\
that it possesses to its inhabitants; as explained<br>\
by Z; but accord. to the relation commonly<br>\
known, it is تَنْصَعُ, with ن and with the unpointed ص; [meaning “it purifies;”; (L in art.<br>\
نصع;)] and there are two other relations, which<br>\
are تَنْضَخُ and تَنْضَخُ. (TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انبضع It was, or became, cut, or cut off.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
ابتضع مِنْهُ He took, or received, [merchandise] from him. (TA: [in which the word بِضَاعَةً<br>\
requires to be supplied in the explanation, and<br>\
is indicated by the context.])<br>\
10<br>\
اِسْتِبْضَاعٌ denotes a kind of matrimonial<br>\
connection practised by people in the Time of<br>\
Ignorance; i. e., A woman&#39;s desiring sexual intercourse with a man only to obtain offspring by<br>\
him: a man of them used to say to his female<br>\
slave or his wife, أَرْسِلِى إِلَى فُلَان فَآسْتَبْضِعِى مِنْهُ<br>\
[Send thou to such a one, and demand of him<br>\
sexual intercourse to obtain offspring]; and he<br>\
used to separate himself from her, and not touch<br>\
her, until her pregnancy by that man became<br>\
apparent: and this he did from a desire of obtaining generous offspring. (IAth, TA.)<br>\

end: and see also بَضْعَةٌ.<br>\
بُضْعٌ Initus; sexual intercourse: (Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K:) a subst., (Mgh, Msb, TA,) accord. to some;<br>\
but accord. to others, an inf. n.; (Msb;) held<br>\
by Sb to be the latter: (TA:) [see 1:] and<br>\
marriage; or the taking in marriage; syn. نِكَاحٌ;<br>\
(ISk, S, Msb, TA;) [which has also the first of<br>\
the meanings given above;] as in the phrase مَلَكَ<br>\
فُلَانٌ بُضْعَ فُلَانَةَ [explained above (see 1)]: (ISk,<br>\
S:) or, (K,) in this phrase, (Mgh,) (tropical:)  the pudendum muliebre; the vulva; (Az, Mgh, Msb, K, *<br>\
TA;) and so in the saying, in a trad., عُتِقَ بُضْعُكِ<br>\
فَاخْتَارِى (tropical:)  Thy vulva hath become freed, therefore<br>\
choose thou whether thou wilt remain with thy<br>\
husband or separate thyself from him; (TA;)<br>\
and in the saying, تُسْتَأْمَرُ النِّسَآءُ فِى أَبْضَاعِهِنَّ,<br>\
accord. to those who thus relate it, others saying<br>\
إِبْضَاعِهِنَّ; (see 4;) أَبْضَاعٌ being pl. of بُضْعٌ.<br>\
(Mgh, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  The marriage-contract.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A dowry; or gift given to, or<br>\
for, a bride: (K, TA:) pl. بُضُوعٌ. (TA.) So<br>\
in the saying of &#39;Amr Ibn-Maadee-Kerib,<br>\
وَفِى كَعْبٍ وَإِخْوَتِهَا كِلَابٍ<br>\
سَوَامِى الطَّرْفِ غَالِيَةُ البُضُوعِ<br>\
[And among Kaab, and their brethren Kiláb, are<br>\
females lofty in look, or] proud, and dear in<br>\
respect of dowries. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Divorce:<br>\
(Az, K:) thus having two contr. significations.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  The authority possessed over a<br>\
woman by her guardian who affiances her. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  And (assumed tropical:)  An equal; particularly as a suitor in<br>\
a case of marriage: as in the saying, in a trad.,<br>\
هٰذَا البُضْعُ لَا يُقْرَعُ أَنْفُهُ (assumed tropical:)  This equal‘s marriage<br>\
shall not be refused, nor shall it be desired, or<br>\
wished for; he shall not be rejected. (TA.)<br>\
بِضْعٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ بَضْعٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) some of the Arabs pronouncing it with<br>\
kesr, (S, Msb,) [A number under ten; and an<br>\
odd number, meaning] a number between two<br>\
round, or decimal, numbers; (AZ, K;) from one<br>\
to ten [exclusive of the latter]; and from eleven<br>\
to twenty [exclusive of the latter]; so accord. to<br>\
Mebremán; (K;) i. e. Mohammad Ibn-&#39;Alee<br>\
Ibn-Ismá&#39;eel the Lexicologist, Mebremán being<br>\
his surname: (TA:) or from three to nine; (S,<br>\
Msb, K [in the first and last the ns.<br>\
being in the fem. gender; but in the second,<br>\
masc.];) so accord. to Katádeh; (Mgh;) from<br>\
three to less than ten: (Fr [the ns. of number in<br>\
the masc. gender]:) or not less than three nor more<br>\
than ten; (Sh [the first n. of number in the fem.<br>\
gender, and the second masc.];) from three to<br>\
ten: (Mgh [the ns. of number in the masc.<br>\
gender]:) or to seven: (Mujáhid, Mgh:) or to<br>\
five: (AO, K [the n. of number in the fem.<br>\
gender]:) or from one to four: (AO, O, K [the<br>\
ns. of number in the masc. gender]:) or to five;<br>\
an explanation ascribed to AO: (TA:) or from<br>\
four to nine; (ISd, K [the ns. of number fem.];)<br>\
and this is the signification preferred by Th:<br>\
(TA:) or it signifies five: (Mukátil [this n. of<br>\
number masc.]:) or seven; (Mukátil, K [in the<br>\
K this n. of number being fem.];) so accord. to<br>\
some: (AO:) or ten: (Ed-Dahhák [this n. of<br>\
number masc.]:) or an undefined number; غَيْرُ<br>\
مَحْدُودٍ; so says Sgh; [and the like is said in the<br>\
Msb;] in the K, erroneously, غَيْرُ مَعْدُودٍ; (TA;)<br>\
because it means a portion, (Sgh, K,) which is<br>\
undefined: (Sgh, TA:) it also signifies, with ten,<br>\
[in like manner; i. e. ten and a number under<br>\
ten; or the like: as] from thirteen to nineteen.<br>\
(Msb.) When used as signifying from three to<br>\
nine, (Mgh, Msb,) or to ten, or to seven, (Mgh,)<br>\
[or to signify some number under ten, without<br>\
another n. of number,] it is masc. and fem. without variation: (Mgh, Msb:) you say بِضْعُ رِجَالٍ<br>\
From three to nine [&amp;c.] men: and بِضْعُ نِسْوَةٍ<br>\
from three to nine [&amp;c.] women: (Msb:) and<br>\
بِضْعُ سِنِينَ from three to nine [&amp;c.] years: (S:)<br>\
and فِى بِضْعِ سِنِينَ [in from three to nine, &amp;c.,<br>\
years]: (Kur xxx. 3:) and فَلَبِثَ فِى السِّجْنِ بِضْعَ<br>\
سِنِينَ [And he remained in the prison from three<br>\
to nine, &amp;c., years]. (Kur xii. 42.) But when<br>\
used to denote a number above ten, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
with a masc. n. it is with ة, (↓ بِضْعَة,) and with a<br>\
fem. n. it is without ة: (ISk, Mgh, Msb, K:)<br>\
you say بِضْعَةَ عَشَرَ رَجُلًا From thirteen to nineteen [&amp;c.] men: and بِضْعَ عَشْرَةَ امْرَأَةً from thirteen<br>\
to nineteen [&amp;c.] women: (S, Mgh, * TA:) like as<br>\
you say ثَلَاثَةَ عَشَرَ رَجُلًا and ثَلَاثَ عَشْرةَ امْرَأَةً.<br>\
(Mgh.) When you have passed the word denoting ten, (S, K,) [i. e.] to denote a number<br>\
above twenty, (Msb,) it is not used: (S, Msb,<br>\
K:) you do not say بِضْعٌ وَعِشْرُونَ, (S, K,) but<br>\
نَيِّفٌ وَعِشْرُونَ; and so in the cases of the remaining<br>\
numbers: (S:) or you do say بِضْعٌ وَعِشْرُونَ:<br>\
(Sgh, K:) accord. to AZ, (Msb,) you say بِضْعَةٌ<br>\
وَعِشْرُونَ رَجُلًا (Mgh, Msb, K) meaning Twenty<br>\
and odd men: (AZ, TA:) and بِضْعٌ وَعِشْرُونَ امْرَأَةً<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K) meaning twenty and odd women:<br>\
(AZ, TA:) but not the reverse: (K:) ISd says,<br>\
we have not heard this, but there is no objection<br>\
to it: (TA:) and Fr says, بِضْعٌ is not mentioned<br>\
save with ten and twenty to ninety; (IB, K;)<br>\
not with what exceeds this: (IB:) you do not<br>\
say بِضْعٌ وَمِائَةٌ nor بِضْعٌ وَأَلْفٌ, (IB, K,) but مِائَةٌ<br>\
وَنَيِّفٌ [and أَلْفٌ وَنَيِّفٌ]: (IB:) it occurs in trads.<br>\
with عِشْرُونَ and with ثَلَاثُونَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بِضْعٌ and<br>\
↓ بَضْعٌ also signify A part, or portion, of the<br>\
night: (K:) a time thereof. (Lh.) You say,<br>\
مَضَى بِضْعٌ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ [A part, or portion, of the<br>\
night passed]. (TA.) J mentions it with ص [in<br>\
the place of ض]; and explains it by جَوْشٌ, q. v.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
بَضْعَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) with fet-h, other words of<br>\
like meaning being with kesr, as قِطْعَةٌ and فِلْذَةٌ<br>\
and فِدْرَةٌ, (S,) and sometimes with kesr, [↓ بِضْعَةٌ,]<br>\
(K,) and ↓ بُضْعَةٌ also is mentioned, (TA,) of<br>\
which the first is the most chaste, though EshShiháb asserts the second to be more common,<br>\
(TA,) A piece, or lump, or portion cut off; (TA;)<br>\
particularly of flesh, or flesh-meat, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
in a compact, or collective, state: (TA:) pl.<br>\
↓ بَضْعٌ, [or rather this is a coll. gen. n., of which<br>\
بَضْعَةٌ is the n. un.,] and بِضَعٌ, (S, Msb, K,) as<br>\
some say, (S,) but this is disallowed by &#39;Alee<br>\
Ibn-Hamzeh, (TA,) [or it may be a correct pl. of<br>\
بِضْعَةٌ agreeably with analogy,] and بِضَاعٌ, and<br>\
بَضَعَاتٌ, (Msb, K,) and [quasi-pl. n.] بَضِيعٌ, which<br>\
is extr., like رَهِينٌ and كَلِيبٌ and مَعِيزٌ [&amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.) Hence the saying [of Mohammad] in a<br>\
trad., فَاطِمَةُ بَضْعَةٌ مِنَّى يَرِيبُنِى مَا رَابَهَا وَيُؤْذِينِى مَا<br>\
آذَاهَا  (tropical:)  Fátimeh is a part of me: [that displeases<br>\
and disquiets me which has displeased and disquieted her, and that hurts me which has hurt<br>\
her:] or, accord. to one relation, he said بُضَيْعَةٌ<br>\
[a little part]. (TA.) One says also, إِنَّ فُلَانًا<br>\
لَشَدِيدُ البَضْعَةِ حَسَنُهَا meaning Verily such a one<br>\
is corpulent and fat. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also بَضَعَةٌ.<br>\
بُضْعَةٌ: see بَضْعَةٌ.<br>\
بِضْعَةٌ: see بَضْعَةٌ: and, as a noun of number,<br>\
see بِضْعٌ, latter half of the paragraph.<br>\
بَضَعَةٌ The sound of cutting of swords: occurring<br>\
in the saying, سَمِعْتُ لِلسِّيَاطِ خَضَعَةً وَلِلسُّيُوفِ بَضَعَةً<br>\
I heard a sound of falling of the whips, and a<br>\
sound of cutting of the swords: (TA:) but in the<br>\
S and A in art. خضع, and by IB, خضعة and<br>\
بضعة are written خَضْعَةٌ and ↓ بَضْعَةٌ; and IB<br>\
explains the former as signifying the sounds of<br>\
swords; and the latter, the sounds of whips. (TA<br>\
in art. خضع.) [See also بَاضِعٌ.]<br>\
بِضَاعٌ [The giving and receiving merchandise;]<br>\
a subst. from أَبْضَعَهُ البِضَاعَةَ and اِبْتَضَعَ مِنْهُ; [or<br>\
rather an inf. n. of which the verb, بَاضَعَ, is not<br>\
used;] similar to قِرَاضٌ. (TA.)<br>\
بَضِيعٌ Flesh. (As, S.) You say, دَابَّةٌ كَثِيرَةُ<br>\
البَضِيعِ (As, S, TA) A beast abounding in what is<br>\
distinct from the rest of the flesh of the thigh:<br>\
n. un. with ة. (TA.) And رَجُلٌ خَاظِى البَضِيعِ<br>\
(As, S) A fat man. (TA.) And سَاعِدٌ خَاظى البَضِيعِ<br>\
[A fore arm, or an upper arm,] full of flesh.<br>\
(IB.) [See also بَضْعَةٌ, of which it is a quasipl. n.]<br>\
بِضَاعَةٌ Merchandise; or an article of merchandise; (TA;) a portion of one&#39;s property<br>\
which one sends for traffic; (S;) a portion of<br>\
property prepared for traffic, (Mgh, * Msb,) or<br>\
with which one traffics; from بَضْعٌ signifying the<br>\
act of “cutting,” or “cutting off;” and vulgarly<br>\
pronounced بُضَاعَةٌ: (TA:) pl. بَضَائِعُ. (Msb, TA.)<br>\
بَاضِعٌ A sword that cuts off a piece of a thing<br>\
that it strikes: (S, TA:) or a sharp, or cutting,<br>\
sword: (K:) or a sword that cuts everything:<br>\
(TA:) pl. بَضَعَةٌ: (K:) Fr says that بَضَعَةٌ signifies swords; and خَضَعَةٌ, whips: but some say<br>\
the reverse. (TA.) [See also بَضَعَةٌ above.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[See also the next paragraph.]<br>\
-A2-  [A broker who<br>\
acts as an intermediary between the sellers and<br>\
buyers of camels;] the same with respect to camels<br>\
as the دَلَّال with respect to houses: (O, L, K:) or<br>\
one who carries the articles of merchandise of the<br>\
tribe, and conveys those articles from place to<br>\
place for sale: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, Sgh, K:) it is said<br>\
in the A that بَاضِعُ الحَىِّ signifies the person who<br>\
carries the articles of merchandise of the tribe.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
بَاضِعَةٌ A wound by which the head is broken,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) which cuts the skin, and<br>\
cleaves the flesh (S, K) in a slight degree, (K,)<br>\
and brings blood, but does not make it to flow:<br>\
(S, K:) or which wounds the skin, and cleaves<br>\
the flesh: (Mgh:) or which cleaves the flesh, but<br>\
does not reach to the bone, nor cause the blood to<br>\
flow: (Msb:) that from which the blood flows<br>\
is termed دَامِيَةٌ [app. a mistake for دَامِعَةٌ]. (S,<br>\
Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  A large flock (فِرْقٌ [in the CK, erroneously, فِرَق,]) of sheep or goats: (S, Sgh, K:)<br>\
or a portion separated from the rest of the sheep<br>\
or goats: (Lth, K:) pl. بَوَاضِعُ: you say, فِرَقٌ بَوَاضِعُ.<br>\
(Lth.)<br>\
أَبْضَعُ as a corroborative after أَجْمَعُ: see أَبْصَعُ,<br>\
with the unpointed ص. Az says that it is an<br>\
evident mistranscription. (TA.)<br>\
مِبْضَعٌ A lancet; an instrument with which a<br>\
vein is cut: (S, Mgh, * K, TA:) and [a currier&#39;s<br>\
knife] with which leather is cut: (S, TA:) [pl.<br>\
مَبَاضِعُ: accord. to the Mirkát el-Loghah, as cited<br>\
by Golius, it signifies a farrier&#39;s fleam; differing<br>\
from مِشْرَطٌ, which signifies a surgeon&#39;s lancet:<br>\
but this distinction is probably post-classical; for<br>\
accord. to the TA, these two words signify the<br>\
same.]<br>\
مَبْضُوعَةٌ [used as a subst.] A bow: a bow cut<br>\
from a branch. (TA.)<br>\
مُسْتَبْضِعٌ. It is said in a prov., كَمُسْتَبْضِعِ تَمْرٍ<br>\
إِلَى هَجَرٍ [Like the taker of dates as merchandise<br>\
to Hejer]; because Hejer is [famous as] the place<br>\
of production (مَعْدِن) of dates. (S.) مستبضع is<br>\
here made trans. by means of الى because it has<br>\
the meaning of حَامِل. (TA.)<br>\
