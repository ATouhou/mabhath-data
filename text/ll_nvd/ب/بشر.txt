بَشَرَ, aor.<br>\
بَشُرَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. بَشْرٌ; (S, Msb,<br>\
K;) and ↓ ابشر, (A,) inf. n. إِبْشَارٌ; (K;) He<br>\
pared (S, A, Msb, K) a hide, (S, A, Msb,) removing its بَشَرَة, (S,) or face, or surface, (A,<br>\
Msb,) or the skin upon which the hair grew:<br>\
(TA:) or, as some say, removing its inner part<br>\
with a large knife: or, accord. to Ibn-Buzurj,<br>\
some of the Arabs say, بَشَرْتُ الأَدِيمَ, aor.<br>\
بَشِرَ,<br>\
meaning I removed from the hide its بَشَرَة; and<br>\
↓ أَبْشَرْتُهُ as meaning I exposed to view its بَشَرَة<br>\
that was next to the flesh; and آدَمْتُهُ I exposed<br>\
to view its أَدَمَة upon which the hair grew. (TA.)<br>\
[But see أَدَمَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the saying in a trad.,<br>\
مَنْ أَحَبَّ القُرْآنَ قَلْيَبْشُرْ, accord. to him who<br>\
recites it thus, with damm to the ش; meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Whoso loveth the Kur-án, let him make himself<br>\
light of flesh, [by not eating more than will be<br>\
sufficient, and so prepare himself] for [reading,<br>\
or reciting,] it, [like as one prepares a horse for<br>\
running,] because eating much causes one to forget it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence also, بَشَرَ الأَرْضَ, (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. as above, (S, K,) (assumed tropical:)  It (a swarm of locusts)<br>\
stripped the ground; (TA;) ate what was upon<br>\
the ground, (S, K,) i. e., upon its surface; as<br>\
though the exterior of the ground were its بَشَرَة.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And بَشَرَ, aor.<br>\
بَشُرَ, (TA,) inf. n. as above,<br>\
(K,) He clipped his mustache much, so that the<br>\
بَشَرَة (i. e. the exterior of the skin, TA) became<br>\
apparent. (K, TA.) This the Muslim is commanded to do. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  بَشَرَنِى فُلَانٌ بِوَجْهٍ حَسَنٍ<br>\
Such a one met me with a cheerful countenance.<br>\
(S.) See also 2, in two places. ―<br>\
-b6-  And see 3.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
بَشِرَ, aor.<br>\
بَشَرَ; (IAar, S, Msb, K;) and بَشَرَ, aor.<br>\
بَشِرَ,<br>\
(IAar, K,) inf. n. بَشْرٌ and بُشُورٌ; (TA;) and<br>\
↓ ابشر, [which is the most common, though extr.<br>\
in respect of analogy, as being quasi-pass. of بَشَرَ,<br>\
like احجم and احنج and اعرض and اقشع and<br>\
اكبّ and انهج, (mentioned by MF in art. حنج<br>\
as the only other instances of the kind,) and<br>\
اخلج, (added in the TA in art. خلج,)] (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, K,) inf. n. إِبْشَارٌ; (S;) and ↓ استبشر; (S,<br>\
A, Msb, K;) and ↓ تبشّر; (A;) [originally, He<br>\
became changed in his بَشَرَة (or complexion) by<br>\
the annunciation of an event: see بَشَّرَهُ: and hence,]<br>\
he rejoiced, or became rejoiced; (IAar, S, A,<br>\
Msb, K;) بِكَذَا [at, or by, such a thing; or at,<br>\
or by, the annunciation of such a thing]. (IAar,<br>\
S, K. *) You say, أَتَانِى أَمْرٌ بَشِرْتُ بِهِ An affair<br>\
happened to me whereat I rejoiced, or whereby<br>\
I became rejoiced. (S.) And بِمَوْلُودٍ ↓ أَبْشَرَ He<br>\
rejoiced [at the annunciation of a new-born child].<br>\
(S.) And بِخَيْرٍ ↓ أَبْشِرْ Rejoice thou [at the annunciation of a good event]. (S, K.) And in the<br>\
same sense ↓ أَبْشِرُوا is used in the Kur xli. 30.<br>\
(S.)<br>\
2<br>\
بشّرهُ (S, A, Msb, &amp;c.,) the form used by<br>\
the Arabs in general, (Msb,) inf. n. تَبْشِيرٌ; (S,<br>\
Msb, K, &amp;c.;) and ↓ بَشَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
بَشُرَ, (S, Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
of the dial. of Tihámeh and the adjacent parts,<br>\
(Msb,) inf. n. بَشْرٌ and بُشُورٌ (S, K) and بُشْرٌ,<br>\
(TA,) or this last is a simple subst.; (Msb;)<br>\
and ↓ ابشرهُ; (S, A, Mgh, K;) and ↓ استبشرهُ; (K,<br>\
TA;) are syn.; (S, K, &amp;c.;) originally signifying He announced to him an event which produced a change in his بَشَرَة [or complexion]: and<br>\
hence, (El-Fakhr Er-Rázee,) he announced to<br>\
him an event which rejoiced him: (A, El-Fakhr<br>\
Er-Rázee:) so in common acceptation [when not<br>\
restricted by an adjunct that denotes its having<br>\
a different meaning: see بُشْرَى and an ex. below<br>\
in this paragraph]: (El-Fakhr Er-Rázee:) or he<br>\
rejoiced him [by an annunciation]: (Msb:) and<br>\
he announced to him an event which grieved him:<br>\
[or he grieved him by an annunciation:] both<br>\
these significations are proper. (El-Fakhr Er-Rázee.) You say, بشّرهُ بِالأَمْرِ [generally meaning<br>\
He rejoiced him by the annunciation of the<br>\
event]; and بِهِ ↓ بَشَرَهُ, aor. and inf. ns. as above;<br>\
&amp;c. (TA.) And بَشَّرْتُهُ بِمَوْلُودٍ [I rejoiced him by<br>\
the annunciation of a new-born child]. (S.) And it<br>\
is said in the Kur [iii. 20, &amp;c.], بَشِّرْهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ<br>\
[Grieve thou them by the annunciation, or denunciation, of a painful punishment]. (S.) You say<br>\
also, of a she-camel, بَشَّرَتْ بِاللَّقَاحِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  She<br>\
made it known that she had begun to be pregnant.<br>\
(TA. [See also 4.])<br>\
3<br>\
باشر المَرْأَةَ, (K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. مُبَاشَرَةٌ (S, Mgh,<br>\
TA) and بِشَارٌ, (TA,) He was, or became, in contact with the woman, skin to skin: (TA:) he<br>\
enjoyed [contact with] her skin: (Msb:) he<br>\
became in contact with her, skin to skin, both<br>\
being within one garment or piece of cloth: (K:)<br>\
he lay with her, [skin to skin; or in the sense of]<br>\
inivit eam: (S, K:) i. q. وَطِئَهَا, both فِى الفَرْجِ<br>\
and خَارِجًا مِنْهُ: (TA:) [and so ↓ بَشَرَهَا inf. n.<br>\
بَشْرٌ; for] بَشْرٌ and مُبَاشَرَةٌ are syn. [in the sense<br>\
of congressus venereus, as is shown by an ex. in<br>\
the S.]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  باشرهُ النَّعِيمُ (tropical:)  [Enjoyment attended him; as though it clave to his skin]. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  فَبَاشَرُوا رَوْحَ اليَقِينِ, or رُوحَ اليقين, is a metaphorical expression, [app. meaning (tropical:)  And they<br>\
felt the joy and happiness that arise from certainty,] occurring in a trad. of &#39;Alee. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
باشر الأَمْرَ, (S, A, &amp;c.,) inf. n. مُبَاشَرَةٌ, (S,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
superintended, managed, or conducted, the affair<br>\
himself, or in his own person: (S, K, TA:) or<br>\
(tropical:)  he was present, himself, at the affair: (A, TA:)<br>\
or, [properly,] he managed, or conducted, the<br>\
affair with his بَشَرَة, i. e., his own hand: (Mgh, *<br>\
Msb:) and hence a later application of the verb<br>\
in the sense of لَاحَظَ (assumed tropical:)  [He regarded, or attended<br>\
to, the thing, or affair, &amp;c.]. (Msb.)<br>\
4<br>\
ابشر: see 1, first sentence, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] ابشر الأَمْرُ وَجْهَهُ The affair made his<br>\
countenance beautiful and bright: in the K we<br>\
read, أَبْشَرَ الأَمْرَ حَسَّنَهُ وَ نَضَّرَهُ; but this is a mistake.<br>\
(TA.) Agreeably with this explanation, AA renders a reading in the Kur [xlii. 22], ذٰلِكَ الَّذِى<br>\
يُبْشِرُ اللّٰهُ عِبَادَهُ, meaning That is it with which<br>\
God will make beautiful and bright the face of<br>\
his servants: so in the L. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 2.<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence,] أَبْشَرَتِ النَّاقَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The she-camel conceived, or became pregnant: (K:) as though she<br>\
rejoiced [her owner] by announcing her conception. (TA. [See 2, last sentence.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  And أَبْشَرَتِ<br>\
الأَرْضُ (tropical:)  The earth put forth its herbage appearing<br>\
upon its surface. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, latter<br>\
part, in four places.<br>\
5<br>\
تَبَشَّرَ see, latter part.<br>\
6<br>\
تباشر القَوْمُ The people, or company of men,<br>\
announced, one to another, a joyful event, or joyful events. (S.) And هُمْ يَتَبَاشَرُونَ بِذٰلِكَ الأَمْرِ<br>\
They rejoice one another by the annunciation of<br>\
that event. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استبشر: see 1, latter part.<br>\
-A2-  استبشرهُ He<br>\
demanded of him a reward for an annunciation<br>\
of joyful tidings. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 2.<br>\
بُشْرٌ: see بُشْرَى. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also a contraction of<br>\
بُشُرٌ, which is pl. of بَشُورٌ (TA) or بَشِيرٌ. (TA in<br>\
art. نشر.)<br>\
بِشْرٌ Cheerfulness, or openness and pleasantness,<br>\
of countenance: (Mgh, Msb, K, * TA:) and happiness, joy, or gladness. (Har p. 192.) You say,<br>\
هُوَ حَسَنُ البِشْرِ He is cheerful, or open and pleasant, in countenance. (S.)<br>\
بَشَرٌ: see بَشَرَةٌ ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] البَشَرُ (assumed tropical:)  Mankind:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) and the human being: (Msb, K:)<br>\
applied to the male and to the female; and used<br>\
alike as sing. and pl. (Msb, K, TA) and dual:<br>\
(TA:) so that you say, هُوَ بَشَرٌ He is a human<br>\
being, and هِىَ بَشَرٌ She is a human being, and<br>\
هُمْ بَشَرٌ They (more than two) are human beings,<br>\
and هُمَا بَشَرٌ They two are human beings: (TA:)<br>\
but sometimes it has the dual form; (Msb, K;)<br>\
as in the Kur xxiii. 49; (Msb, TA;) though the<br>\
Arabs may have used the dual form in the sense<br>\
of the sing.: (MF:) and sometimes it has a pl.,<br>\
namely, أَبْشَارٌ. (K.) This is a secondary application of the word: (Msb:) i. e., this signification<br>\
is tropical; or, as some say, the word is so much<br>\
used in this sense as to be, so used, conventionally<br>\
regarded as proper; the sense not depending upon<br>\
its having another word connected with it: but<br>\
in the S and K, and by the generality of authors,<br>\
this signification is given as proper. (MF.) Some<br>\
say that a human being is thus called because his<br>\
بَشَرَة is bare of hair and of wool. (MF.) [Hence,]<br>\
أَبُو البَشَرِ [The father of mankind; meaning]<br>\
Adam. (K.)<br>\
بَشَرَةٌ (Lth, S, M, A, Mgh, Msb) and ↓ بَشَرٌ, (S,<br>\
K,) or the latter is pl. of the former, (Msb, K,)<br>\
[or rather a coll. gen. n., of which the former is<br>\
the n. un.,] like قَصَبَهُ and قَصَبٌ, (Msb,) and أَبْشَارٌ<br>\
is pl. of بَشَرٌ, (K,) [The external skin; the cuticle,<br>\
or scarf-skin; the epidermis;] the exterior of the<br>\
skin (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) of a human being;<br>\
(S, A, K;) and, as some say, of other creatures,<br>\
(K,) such as the serpent; but this is generally<br>\
disallowed: (TA:) or بَشَرَةٌ signifies the exterior<br>\
of the skin of the head, in which grows the hair;<br>\
as also أَدَمَةٌ and شَوَاةٌ: (Aboo-Safwán:) or the<br>\
upper skin (Lth, M) of the head (M) and of the<br>\
face and body of a human being; (Lth, M;) that<br>\
upon which the hair grows: (M:) or, as some<br>\
say, that which is next the flesh. (M.) It is said<br>\
in a prov., إِنَّمَا يُعَاتَبُ الأَدِيمُ ذُو البَشَرَةِ: see أَدِيمٌ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  بَشَرَةٌ sometimes means The complexion, or<br>\
hue: and fineness, or delicacy. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  بَشَرَةُ<br>\
الأَرْضُ (tropical:)  The herbage appearing upon the surface<br>\
of the earth. (S, A, K.) You say, مَا أَحْسَنَ بَشَرَتَهَا<br>\
(tropical:)  How goodly is its herbage appearing upon its<br>\
surface! (S, A.) And بَشَرَةٌ [alone] signifies (tropical:)  Leguminous plants; herbs, or herbage. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
بَشَرَةٌ is used also as signifying (assumed tropical:)  A man&#39;s hand.<br>\
(Msb.) [See 3, last sentence.]<br>\
بُشْرَى (imperfectly decl., because it terminates<br>\
with a fem. alif which is inseparable from it, S)<br>\
and ↓ بِشَارَةٌ and ↓ بُشَارَةٌ [but respecting this last<br>\
see بِشَارَةٌ below] (S, Msb, K) and ↓ بُشْرٌ (Msb)<br>\
are substs. from بَشَّرَهُ (S, Msb, K) [originally<br>\
signifying An annunciation which produces a<br>\
change in the بَشَرَة (or complexion) of the person<br>\
to whom it is made: and hence, a joyful annunciation; joyful, or glad, tidings; good news]:<br>\
and ↓ تَبَاشِيرُ [q. v. infrà] signifies the same as<br>\
بُشْرَى: (S, K:) ↓ بِشَارَةٌ, when used absolutely,<br>\
relates only to good; (S, Msb;) not to evil unless<br>\
when expressly restricted thereto by an adjunct:<br>\
[see 2:] (S:) its pl. is بِشَارَاتٌ and بَشَائِرُ. (A.)<br>\
يَا بُشْرَاىَ, in the Kur [xii. 19, accord. to one reading, (otherwise, as Bd mentions, بُشْرَاىْ, or بُشْرَىَّ,<br>\
which is a dial. var. of the same, or بُشْرَى, which,<br>\
as some say, was the name of a man,) meaning<br>\
O my joyful annunciation, or joyful tidings, or<br>\
good news!], is like عَصَاى: and in the dual you<br>\
say, يَا بُشْرَيَىَّ. (S.) You say also, ↓ تَتَابَعَتِ البِشَارَاتُ<br>\
and البَشَائِرُ [The joyful annunciations followed consecutively]. (A.) See another ex. voce بَشِيرٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also بِشَارَةٌ.<br>\
[<br>\
بَشَرِىٌّ Human; of, or belonging to, or relating<br>\
to, mankind or a human being.]<br>\

as will be seen by an ex. in what follows,] One<br>\
who announces to a people [or person] an event,<br>\
either good or evil; (TA;) but meaning the<br>\
former oftener than the latter: (Msb:) [an announcer of a joyful event, or joyful events: one<br>\
who rejoices another, or others, by an annunciation:] pl. بُشَرَآءُ (A) and بُشُرٌ, (TA in art. نشر,)<br>\
or this is pl. of ↓ بَشُورٌ. (TA in the present art.)<br>\
It is said in the Kur [vii. 55], وَ هُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ<br>\
الرِّيَاحَ بُشُرًا, and بُشْرًا, and ↓ بُشْرَى, and بَشْرًا;<br>\
[accord. to different readings, meaning (assumed tropical:)  And He<br>\
it is who sendeth the winds announcing coming<br>\
rain;] in which بُشُرٌ is pl. of ↓ بَشُورٌ, [syn. with<br>\
بَشِيرٌ and مُبَشِّرٌ, but both masc. and fem.,] (TA,)<br>\
or of بَشِيرٌ, (Bd,) or of بَشِيرَةٌ; (TA in art. نشر;)<br>\
and بُشْرًا is a contraction of the same; and بُشْرَى<br>\
is syn. with بِشَارَةٌ; and بَشْرًا is the inf. n. of بَشَرَهُ<br>\
in the sense of بَشَّرَهُ (TA. [But the reading<br>\
commonly followed in this passage is نُشُرًا, with<br>\
ن: another reading is نُشْرًا: another, نَشْرًا: and<br>\
another, نَشَرًا.]) And ↓ المُبَشِّرَاتُ, (A,) or مُبَشِّرَاتُ<br>\
الرِّيَاحِ, (S,) signifies (tropical:)  Winds that announce<br>\
[coming] rain: (S, A:) so in the Kur xxx. 45.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Goodly; beautiful; elegant in<br>\
form or features; (S, K;) applied to a man, and<br>\
to a face: (TA:) fem. with ة; (S, K;) applied<br>\
to a woman, and to a she-camel; (S;) and meaning, when applied to a she-camel, neither emaciated nor fat: or, accord. to Aboo-Hilál, neither<br>\
of generous nor of ignoble breed: or, as some say,<br>\
half-fattened: (TA:) pl. of the fem. بَشَائِرُ: (S:)<br>\

-b2-  Also A gift to him<br>\
who announces a joyful event; and so ↓ بُشَارَةٌ: (K, *<br>\
TA:) or the latter, which is like the عُمَالَة of the<br>\
عَامِل, has this signification; (IAth;) and so ↓ بُشْرَى;<br>\
(M;) and بِشَارَةٌ [has the same meaning accord. to common usage, but, properly,] is a subst. in the sense<br>\
explained above, voce بُشْرَى. (IAth.) You say,<br>\

of El-Hajjáj, تَبْشِيرٌ occurs as meaning (assumed tropical:)  the commencement of rain. (TA.) One says, فِيهِ مَخَايِلُ<br>\
