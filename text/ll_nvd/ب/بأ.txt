بَأْبَأَهُ, (Lth, T, S, M, K,) and بأبأ بِهِ,<br>\
(Fr, M, K,) inf. n. بَأْبَآَةُ (Lth, T, M) and بَئْبَآءٌ;<br>\
(Fr, M;) [as also بأَبِى; see art. بِأَبِى أَنْتَ;] He said to<br>\
him, بِأَبِي, (Fr, M,) or بأَبَا, (M,) or بِأَبِى أَنْتَ,<br>\
(Lth, T, K,) [all meaning With my father mayest<br>\
thou be ransomed! or] meaning أَفْدِيكَ بِأَبِى [I<br>\
will ransom thee with my father]; (Lth, T;) or<br>\
he said to him, بِأَبِى أَنْتَ وَأُمِّى [With my father<br>\
mayest thou be ransomed, and with my mother!<br>\
or I will ransom thee &amp;c.; see art. ابو]; (S;) the<br>\
current phrase of the Arabs being that which<br>\
includes both parents: (TA:) i. e., a man said so<br>\
to another man, (Lth, T, M,) or to a child; (Fr,<br>\
S, M;) and in like manner to his horse, for having<br>\
saved him from some accident: (IAar, T:) the<br>\
verb is derived from بِأَبِى. (Lth, T, M.) Hence<br>\
البِأَبْ, in an ex. cited voce أَبٌ, in art. ابو, q. v.;<br>\
(M;) or البِئَبْ; (TA in art. ابو;) or البِيَبْ. (S<br>\
in that art.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,] بَأبَؤُوهُ They made a<br>\
show of treating him with graciousness, courtesy,<br>\
or blandishment; as also عَلَيْهِ ↓ تَبَأْبَؤُوا. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence also,] ↓ بَأْبَآءٌ, with medd, [used as an<br>\
inf. n.,] A woman&#39;s dandling, or dancing, of her<br>\
child. (AA, T.)<br>\
-A2-  بَأْبَأَ also signifies He (a child)<br>\
said ↓ بَأْبَأْ (M, K) [in some copies of the K written<br>\
بَابَا, both meaning Papa, or Father,] to his father.<br>\
(M.) [Accord. to the TA, the verb is trans. in<br>\
this sense, as in the senses before explained; but<br>\
I think that بَأْبَأَهُ has been there erroneously put<br>\
for بَأْبَأَ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And He (a stallion [meaning a stallion-camel]) reiterated the sound of the letter ب<br>\
[or b] in his braying. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence, perhaps,] ↓ بَأْبَأٌ [or, more probably, ↓ بَأْبَآءٌ, with medd,<br>\
agreeably with analogy, used as an inf. n.,] The<br>\
chiding of the cat, or act of chiding the cat;<br>\
(AA, T, Sgh;) also termed غَسٌّ. (AA, T.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
Also He hastened, made haste, or sped: and<br>\
↓ تَبَأْبَأْنَا we hastened, &amp;c.: (marginal note in a<br>\
copy of the S:) or ↓ تَبَأْبَأَ signifies he ran. (ElUmawee, T, K.)<br>\

بَأْبأْ and بَأْبَأٌ: see R. Q. 1, in two places.<br>\
بُؤْبُؤٌ The source, origin, race, root, or stock,<br>\
syn. أَصْلٌ, (AA, Sh, T, S, M, K,) of a man, (Sh,<br>\
T,) whether noble or base. (AA, T.) You say,<br>\
هُوَ كَرِيمُ البُؤْبُؤِ He is of generous, or noble,<br>\
origin; lit., generous, or noble, of origin. (TK.)<br>\
And فُلَانٌ فِىبُؤْبُؤِ الكَرَمِ Such a one is of [a race]<br>\
the source (أَصْل) of generosity, or nobleness. (S.<br>\
[In the PS, من is here put in the place of فى:<br>\
but فى is often used in phrases of the same kind<br>\
and meaning as that above, in the sense of مِنْ.])<br>\
IKh cites from Jereer,<br>\
فِى يُؤْبُؤِ المَجْدِ وَبُحْبُوحِ الكَرَمْ<br>\
[Of a race the source of glory, and the very heart<br>\
of generosity, or nobleness]: but Aboo-&#39;Alee El-<br>\
Kálee quotes the words thus;<br>\
فِى ضِئْضِئِ المَجْدِ وَ بُؤْبُوْءِ الكَرَمْ<br>\
[which may be rendered, of a race the source of<br>\
glory, and the very root of generosity]; whence<br>\
it appears that بُؤْبُوءٌ is a dial. var. of بُؤْبُؤٌ in the<br>\
sense here given. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The middle of a<br>\
thing; (K;) [and app. the heart, or very heart,<br>\
thereof; the middle as being the best part of a<br>\
thing;] like بُحْبُوحٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, perhaps,]<br>\
The pupil, or apple, or the image that is seen<br>\
reflected in the black, (عَيْر AA, T, or إِنْسَان K,)<br>\
of the eye. (AA, T, K.) Whence the saying,<br>\
هُوَ أَعَزُّ عَلَىِّ مِنْ بُؤْبُؤِ عَيْنِى [He is dearer to me<br>\
than the apple of my eye; a saying common in<br>\
the present day, with the substitution of إِنْسَان<br>\
for بُؤْبُؤ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  A generous, or noble, (ISk,<br>\
T,) or a clever, an ingenious, or an accomplished,<br>\
or a well-bred, or an elegant, (M, K,) and a light,<br>\
an active, or a sprightly, (M,) lord, master, chief,<br>\
or personage: (ISk, T, M, K:) fem. with ة.<br>\
(IKh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also, (AA, T, S, * [but I find it<br>\
only in one of three copies of the S,]) or ↓ بُؤْبُؤْءٌ,<br>\
and ↓ بَأْبَآءٌ, (K,) the last from the M, (TA, [but<br>\
it is not in the M as transcribed in the TT,]) A<br>\
learned man (AA, T, S, K) who teaches; (AA,<br>\
T;) but the teaching of others is not a condition<br>\
required in the application of the epithet; (TA;)<br>\
like سَرْسُورٌ. (S [in which this last word is evidently given as a syn.: but in the K it is given<br>\
to show the form, only, of بُؤْبُوْءٌ].) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also The<br>\
body of a locust, (K,) without the head and legs.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And, accord. to the K, The head, or<br>\
uppermost part, of a vessel in which [the collyrium<br>\
called] كُحْل is kept: but it will appear, in art.<br>\
يأ, that this is [perhaps] a mistranscription for يُؤْيُؤٌ.<br>\
