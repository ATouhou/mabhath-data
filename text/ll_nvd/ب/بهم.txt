for البَهْمُ:]) or it is applied to a lamb or goat<br>\
when just brought forth, i. e., before it is termed<br>\
سَخْلَةٌ: (Mgh: [and this is agreeable with its<br>\
application in a trad. cited by IAth:]) or to the<br>\

valour: (AO, S:) or, as in the Nawádir, رَجُلٌ بُهْمَةٌ<br>\
signifies a man who will not be turned from a<br>\
thing that he desires to do: (TA:) it is not<br>\

the approach is as though it were closed against<br>\
his adversaries. (A, TA.) Accord. to IJ, it is an<br>\

بُهْمَى, a word both sing. and pl., (Sb, S, K,) its<br>\
alif [written ى] being a denotative of the fem.<br>\
gender, wherefore it is without tenween; (Sb, S;)<br>\
or [it is written بُهْمًى, with tenween, for it is a<br>\
coll. gen. n., and] its n. un. is بُهْمَاةٌ, (S, K, and so<br>\
in the JK,) its alif, some say, being a letter of<br>\
quasi-coordination; but Mbr says that this is not<br>\
known, and that the alif in a word of the measure<br>\
فُعْلى is nought but a denotative of the fem. gender;<br>\

(JK,) are vehemently fond of it as long as it is<br>\
green; (Lth, JK, TA;) but when it dries up, its<br>\
prickles bristle out, and it repugns; (Lth, TA;)<br>\
it is of the herbs (بُقُول) that are termed أَحْرَاز<br>\
[app. here meaning slender and sweet] when fresh<br>\
and when dry, and comes forth at first undistinguishably as to species, from the earth, like as<br>\
does corn; then it becomes like corn, and puts<br>\
forth prickles like those [that compose the awn,<br>\
or beard,] of the ear of corn, which, when they<br>\
enter the noses of the sheep or goats and the<br>\
camels, cause pain to their noses, until men pull<br>\
them out from their mouths and their noses; and<br>\
when it becomes large, and dries up, it is a pasture that is fed upon until the rain of the next<br>\
year falls upon it, when its seed that has fallen<br>\
from its ears germinates beneath it. (AHn, TA.)<br>\
بَهِيمٌ Black: (K:) pl. بُهُمٌ. (TA.) And [app.<br>\

colour that is clear, pure, or unmixed, not resembling any other, (AA, K, * TA,) whether it be<br>\
