بَانَهُ, aor. يَبُونُ, (S in art. بين, Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
بَوْنٌ, (Msb, TA,) i. q. بَانَهُ aor. يَبِينُ, (S ubi<br>\
suprà K,) inf. n. بَيْنٌ, (TA,) meaning He excelled<br>\
him; (S* ubi suprà, Msb;) he surpassed him in<br>\
excellence and in manly virtue: so in the Iktitáf.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
بَانٌ [a coll. gen. n., The ben-tree; a species of<br>\
moringa; so in the present day;] a kind of tree,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) well known: (Msb:) n. un.<br>\
with ة: (S, Mgh, Msb:) its seed, or grain, [called<br>\
حَبُّ البَانِ and جَوْزُ البَانِ and فُسْتُقُ البَانِ, the glans<br>\
unguentaria, or nux unguentaria, or ben-nut,] has<br>\
a good, or pleasant, [fragrant] oil, (K,) called<br>\
دُهْنُ البَانِ [oil of ben], (S, Mgh, Msb,) and simply<br>\
بَانٌ, the prefixed noun being suppressed: (Mgh:)<br>\
[Az says,] it is the pl. of بَانَةٌ. which is a certain<br>\
tree having a fruit, or produce, which is perfumed<br>\
with aromatics, after which its oil is expressed, of<br>\
a good [or fragrant] quality: (T in art. بنى:<br>\
its seed, or grain, is good for [removing] the<br>\
[affections of the skin termed] بَرَش and نَمَش and<br>\
كَلَف and حَصَف and بَهَق and سَعَفَة and the<br>\
mange, or scab, and for the peeling of the skin,<br>\
applied in the form of a liniment with vinegar;<br>\
and for hardness of the liver and the spleen, made<br>\
into a beverage with vinegar; and a مِثْقَال thereof,<br>\
drunk, is an emetic, which loosens crude phlegm:<br>\
(K:) AHn says, (TA,) it is a kind of tree that<br>\
grows tall, in a straight, or an erect, manner,<br>\
like as grows the [species of tamarisk called]<br>\
أَثْل, and its leaves are [of the kind termed] هَدَب,<br>\
like those of the اثل, but its wood has no hardness:<br>\
the n. un. is with پ: Aboo-Ziyád says, it is of the<br>\
[trees called] عِضَاه, and has long هدب, intensely<br>\
green; it grows upon [hills, or what are termed]<br>\
هَضْب; and its fruit resembles the pods of the<br>\
[species of kidney-bean called] لُوبِيَآء, except that its<br>\
greenness is intense; and in it is a seed, or grain,<br>\
from which is extracted the oil of the بان: on<br>\
account of the straightness of its growth and of<br>\
the growth of its braches, and their length and<br>\
tenderness, the poets liken thereto the tender girl<br>\
of tall and beautiful, or just, stature; saying<br>\
كَأَنَّهَا بَانَةٌ [As though she were a ben-tree], and<br>\
كَأَنَّهَا غُصْنُ بَانٍ [As though she were a branch of<br>\
the ben-tree], &amp;c.: thus does Keys Ibn-El-Kha-<br>\
teem: (M in art. بين:) and so does Imra-el-<br>\
Keys. (TA.) [See an ex. voce بَرَهْرَهَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2- [It<br>\
is also applied in the present day to A species of<br>\
willow, the salix Aegyptia of Linnæus, properly<br>\
called in Arabic خِلَاف: and this is said to be<br>\
meant by modern Arab poets when they liken an<br>\
elegant girl to a twig of the بان; but probably<br>\
from their erroneously supposing this tree to be<br>\
meant in the same case by the older poets.]<br>\
بَوْنٌ Excellence: an excellent quality; (S in<br>\
art. بين, Msb;) as also ↓ بَوْنَةٌ: (IAar; T:) or the<br>\
distance, space, or interval, between tow things;<br>\
as also darr; بُونٌ. (M, K.) You say, بَيْنَهُمَا بَوْنٌ بَعِيدٌ<br>\
(T, S, Msb*) and بَيْنٌ بَعِيدٌ (T, S) [Between them<br>\
two (meaning two men) is a wide distance]; i. e.<br>\
between their tow degrees of rank or dignity, or<br>\
between the estimations in which they are commonly held: (Msb:) the former phrase is the<br>\
more chaste: (S:) when corporeal distance is<br>\
meant, one says, بَيْنَهُمَا بَيْنٌ, with ى; (Msb;) or<br>\
in the case of [literal] distance, one says, إِنَّ بَيْنَهُمَا<br>\
لَبَيْنًا; not otherwise. (S.)<br>\
بُونٌ: see بَوْنٌ.<br>\
بَوْنَةٌ: see بَوْنٌ ―<br>\
