بَابَ لَهُ, aor. يَبُوبُ, (M, K,) quasi-inf. n., if<br>\
there be such a verb, بِوَابَةٌ, with the و not changed<br>\
into ى because it is not an inf. n. properly speaking, but a subst., (Lth, T,) He was, or became, a<br>\
door-keeper, or gate-keeper, to him; (M, K;)<br>\
namely, a Sultán (M) [or other person].<br>\
2<br>\
بوّب [app., (assumed tropical:)  He practised what are termed<br>\
أَبْوَابُ الحَرْبِ, meaning the expedients, tricks, or<br>\
stratagems, of war, battle, or fight. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He charged upon, attacked, or assaulted, the<br>\
enemy. (AA, T.)<br>\
-A2-  بَوَّبْتُ الأَشْيَآءَ (assumed tropical:)  I made the<br>\
things to be divided into distinct أَبْوَاب [meaning<br>\
kinds, or sorts; or I disposed, arranged, distributed, or classified, the things under distinct heads].<br>\
(Msb.) And بوّب الأَبْوَابَ (assumed tropical:)  [He disposed, arranged, distributed, classified, or set in order, the<br>\
kinds, sorts, classes, chapters, heads, or the like].<br>\
(TA voce أَصَّلَ, q. v.) And بوّب المُؤَلِّفُ كِتَابَهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [The author disposed, or divided, his book in, or<br>\
into, distinct chapters]. (A.) [See بَابٌ.]<br>\
5<br>\
تبوّب, (A,) or تبوّب بَوَّابًا, (S, M, K,) He<br>\
took for himself a door-keeper, or gate-keeper.<br>\
(S, M, A, K.)<br>\
بَابٌ, originally بَوَبٌ, (M, Msb,) A door; a<br>\
gate; a place of entrance: and the thing with<br>\
which a place of entrance, such as a door or gate,<br>\
is closed; of wood &amp;c.: (MF, TA:) pl. أَبْوَابٌ<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K) and بِيبَانٌ (M, K) and أَبْوِبَةٌ, (S,<br>\
M, K,) [a pl. of pauc., said to be] only used for<br>\
conformity with another word mentioned therewith, as in the saying (of Ibn-Mukbil, so in a<br>\
copy of the S),<br>\
هَتَّاكُ أَخْبِيَةٍ وَ لَّاجُ أَبْوِبَةٍ<br>\
[A frequent render of tents, a frequent enterer of<br>\
doors], (S, M,) not being allowable when occurring alone; (S;) but IAar and Lh assert that it<br>\
is a pl. of باب without its being used for conformity with another word; (M;) and this is<br>\
extr.; (M, K;) for باب is of the measure فَعَلٌ,<br>\
and a word of this measure has not a pl. of the<br>\
measure أَفْعِلَةٌ [by rule]. (M.) You say, بَابٌ<br>\
الدَّارِ [The door of the house]; and بَابُ البَيْتِ<br>\
[the door of the house, and of the chamber, and of<br>\
the tent]; (Msb;) and بَابُ البَلَدِ [the gate of the<br>\
town or city]. (The Lexicons &amp;c. passim.) And<br>\
Bishr Ibn-Abee-Házim assigns a باب to a grave;<br>\
calling the latter a بَيْت. (M.) It is also applied<br>\
to an opening, or a channel, made for water, to<br>\
irrigate seed-produce: pl. أَبْوَابٌ. (Mgh.) [And<br>\
in Egypt, it is applied also to A sepulchral chamber, grotto, or cave, hewn in a mountain; from<br>\
the Coptic<br>\
βηβ: pl. بِيبَانٌ only.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, i. e.<br>\
in a secondary application, the primary signification being “ a place of entrance,” it is used as<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  A means of access, or of attainment, to<br>\
a thing: (B, Kull, TK:) as in the saying, هٰذَا<br>\
العِلْمُ بَابٌ إِلَى عِلْمِ كَذَا (tropical:)  This science is a means<br>\
of attainment to such a science. (B, TK.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[And hence, (assumed tropical:)  An expedient, a trick, a stratagem,<br>\
or a process, by which something is to be effected<br>\
pl. أَبْوَابٌ: as in أَبْوَابُ الحَرْبِ the expedients. &amp;c.<br>\
of war, battle, or fight; and بَابٌ مِنَ النُّجُومِ a<br>\
process of the science of the stars, meaning astrology or astronomy; and بَابٌ مِنَ السِّحْرِ a process<br>\
of enchantment; see an ex. voce سِحْرٌ. Compare<br>\
Matt. xvi. 18,<br>\
πύλαι ᾅδου οὐ � degreesατισχύσουσιν αύτη�,<br>\
probably meaning “ the stratagems of Hell shall<br>\
not prevail against it. ”] ―<br>\
-b4-  [Also (assumed tropical:)  A mode, kind,<br>\
sort, class, or category.] Suweyd Ibn-Kuráa uses<br>\
metaphorically the pl. أَبْوَاب in relation to rhymes;<br>\
saying,<br>\
أَتَيْتُ بِأَبْوَابِ القَوَافِى كَأَنَّمَا<br>\
أَذُودُ بِهَا سِرْبًا مِنَ الوَحْشِ نُزَّعَا<br>\
(tropical:)  [I gave utterance to the various kinds of rhymes<br>\
as though I were driving with them a herd of<br>\
wild animals desirous of the males, or of their<br>\
wonted places of pasture]. (M, L.) [You say<br>\
also, هُوَ مِنْ هٰذَا البَابِ (assumed tropical:)  It is of this mode, kind,<br>\
sort, class, or category: a phrase of frequent<br>\
occurrence in lexicons &amp;c. See also بَابَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b5-  [Also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A chapter; and sometimes a section, or subdivision, of a chapter; of a book or writing;]<br>\
conventionally, (assumed tropical:)  a piece consisting of words relating to matters of one kind; and sometimes, to<br>\
matters of one species: (Kull:) pl. أَبْوَابٌ. (A.)<br>\
See also بَابَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b6-  [Also (assumed tropical:)  A head, or class of items<br>\
or articles, in an account, or a reckoning; as in the<br>\
saying,] بَيَّنْتُ لَهُ حِسَابَهُ بَابًا بَابًا (assumed tropical:)  [I explained, or<br>\
made clear, to him his account, or reckoning,<br>\
head by head, or each class of items or articles<br>\
by itself]; a phrase mentioned by Sb: (M:) [or,<br>\
sometimes,] بَابٌ (M, K) and ↓ بَابَةٌ (T, M, K) are<br>\
used in relation to حُدُود [which here means the<br>\
punishments so termed], and to an account, or a<br>\
reckoning, (T, M, K,) and the like, (T, M,) as<br>\
signifying the extreme term or limit; syn. غَايَةٌ;<br>\
(M, K;) but IDrd hesitated respecting this, and<br>\
therefore it is not mentioned in the S. (TA.)<br>\
بَابَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A mode, or manner; syn. وَجْهٌ: (ISk,<br>\
K:) pl. بَابَاتٌ. (K.) [See also بَابٌ, which has a<br>\
similar, and perhaps the same, signification.]<br>\
Hence, هٰذَا مِنْ بَابَتِى means (assumed tropical:)  This is of the<br>\
mode, or manner, that I desire; (TA;) this is<br>\
suitable to me: (IAmb, TA:) and هٰذَا شَىْءٌ مِنْ<br>\
بَابَتِكَ, (S,) or هٰذَا بَابَتُكَ, (A,) (assumed tropical:)  this is a thing<br>\
suitable to thee: (S, A:) and هٰذَا بَابَتُهُ (assumed tropical:)  this is<br>\
suitable to him. (K.) Accord. to most of the<br>\
critics, it is tropical. (TA.) You say also, فُلَانٌ<br>\
أَهْوَنُ بَابَاتِهِ الكَذِبُ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one, the lightest of<br>\
the kinds (أَنْوَاع) of his wickedness is lying. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A habit: a property; a quality; nature;<br>\
natural disposition: or a practice; or an action:<br>\
syn. خَصْلَةٌ. (Abu-l-&#39;Omeythil, TA.) [Hence,<br>\
perhaps, the last of the exs. cited above from the<br>\
A.] ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  A condition; syn. شَرْطٌ: as in the saying,<br>\
هذَا بَابَةُ هٰذَا (assumed tropical:)  [This is the condition of this].<br>\
(M, K. *) ―<br>\
-b4-  بَابَاتُ الكِتَابِ (assumed tropical:)  The lines of the book<br>\
or writing: (M, A, K:) or it may mean its<br>\
↓ أَبْوَاب [i. e. chapters, or sections of chapters]:<br>\
(M:) this has no sing.: (A, K:) [ISd says,] I<br>\
have not heard any sing. of it. (M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also<br>\
بَابٌ; last signification.<br>\
بَوْبَاةٌ A desert; or a desert in which is no water;<br>\
syn. فَلَاةٌ: (T, IJ, M, K:) as also مَوْمَاةٌ; (T, MF;)<br>\
the ب being changed into م, as is often the case.<br>\
(MF.) [It is mentioned in the S, and again in<br>\
the K, in art. بو, as syn. with مَفَازَةٌ.]<br>\
بِوَابَةٌ The office, or occupation, of a door-keeper,<br>\
or gate-keeper. (M, K.) [See 1.]<br>\
بَوَّابٌ A door-keeper, or gate-keeper. (S, * M,<br>\
Msb, K, TA.)<br>\
أَبْوَابٌ مُبَوَّبَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Kinds, sorts, classes, chapters,<br>\
heads, or the like, disposed, arranged, distributed,<br>\
classified, or set in order,] is a phrase similar<br>\
to أَصْنَافٌ مُصَنَّفَةٌ. (S.) You say also كِتَابٌ مُبَوَّبٌ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [A book disposed in, or divided into, distinct<br>\
chapters]. (A.)<br>\
Quasi بوج<br>\
بَاجٌ; pl. أَبْوَاجٌ: see art. بأج. AZ mentions it<br>\
as without ء: ISk, as with ء. (ISd, TA.)<br>\
