in the K, الحَدَقَةُ is erroneously put for الوَرَقَةُ:<br>\
(TA:) a ticket that is attached to a garment, or<br>\
piece of cloth, (T, S, M, L, K,) bearing the mark,<br>\
or inscription, of its price; (T, S, L, K;) or a<br>\
ticket marked, or inscribed, with the weight, and<br>\
the number, of a thing: (TA:) of the dial. of<br>\
Egypt (T, S, L) and the neighbouring parts: (T,<br>\
L:) so called, (K,) or said (by Sh, TA) to be so<br>\
called, (S,) because it is tied by a twist, or thread,<br>\
(بِطَاقَةً,) of the unwoven end of the cloth: (S, K:)<br>\
but this is a mistake: (ISd, TA:) [in Greek,<br>\
πιττά� degreesιον, as observed by Freytag; and hence<br>\
probably derived:] accord. to some, it is [نِطَاقَةً,]<br>\
with ن, because it tells (تَنْطِقُ) what is marked,<br>\
or inscribed, thereon; but this is strange. (TA.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., that a man will be brought<br>\
on the day of resurrection, and ninety-nine scrolls,<br>\
or records, inscribed with his sins will be produced; and there will be produced for him a بطاقة<br>\
bearing the testimony that there is no deity but<br>\
God, and it will outweigh the others. (TA.)<br>\
