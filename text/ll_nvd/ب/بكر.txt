بَكَرَ and<br>\
غَدَا both [properly] relate to the<br>\

بَكُرَ, inf. n. بُكُورٌ;<br>\

(T, A:) or ↓ ابكر, inf. n. إِبْكَارٌ, signifies he entered<br>\

it]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence,] بَكَرَ إِلَيْهِ, [and عَلَيْهِ,]<br>\
aor. and inf. n. as above; (Msb;) and بَكِرَ اليه,<br>\
aor.<br>\
بَكَرَ; (ISd, K; * [but see a remark respecting<br>\

in the morning, in the first part of the day; or<br>\
between the time of the prayer of daybreak and<br>\

&amp;c. at that time; and to betake himself to an<br>\
action at that time: and (assumed tropical:)  to hasten, or betake<br>\

of the خُطْبَة: (S, K:) or he heard the first portion of the خُطْبَة; (A, Msb;) [and] ابتكر الخُطْبَةَ<br>\

occurring in a trad., (S, Msb,) respecting [the<br>\

Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, whoso hasteneth to the Fridayprayers, before the call to prayer, and arriveth<br>\
at the commencement of their time: or both the<br>\
verbs signify the same, and the [virtual] repetition is to give intensiveness and strength to the<br>\
meaning. (TA. [See 2.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  You say also, ابتكرهُ,<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  He took, (A, Msb,) or obtained possession of, (S, TA,) its بَاكُورَة, (S, TA,) i. e.,<br>\

Mgh, Msb,) and ↓ بَكَّرَهَا, (TA,) (tropical:)  He ate the first<br>\

Mgh:) or he did so before she had attained to<br>\
puberty. (Msb in art. قض, and TA in art. خضر.)<br>\

fresh dough for preparing bread]. (K in art.<br>\

بَكْرٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ بُكْرٌ, (K,) but<br>\
this latter is hardly to be found in any of the<br>\
lexicons, (MF,) and ↓ بِكْرٌ, (ISd, TA,) A youthful<br>\
he-camel; one in a state of youthful vigour: fem.<br>\
with ة; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) and also بَكْرٌ, without<br>\
ة: (TA:) the term بَكْرٌ, applied to a camel, corresponds to فَتًى, applied to a human being; and<br>\
بَكْرَةٌ, to فَتَاةٌ; and قَلُوصٌ, to جَارِيَةٌ; and بَعِيرٌ, to<br>\
إِنْسَانٌ; and جَمَلٌ, to رَجُلٌ; and نَاقَةٌ, to مَرْأَةٌ:<br>\
(AO, S:) or the offspring, or young one, of a she-camel; (K;) thus indefinitely explained: (TA:)<br>\
or a camel in his sixth year (ثَنِىٌّ) [and] until he<br>\
becomes a جَذَع: [but it seems that the reverse<br>\
must be meant; for a جذع, of camels, is one in<br>\
his fifth year:] or a camel in his second year<br>\
[and] until he enters his sixth year: or a camel<br>\
in his second year, or that has entered his third<br>\
year, or that has completed his second year and<br>\
entered his third year; syn. اِبْنُ لَبُونٍ: (K:) and<br>\
a camel that has just entered upon his fourth year:<br>\
and a camel in his fifth year: (IAar, Az:) or a<br>\
camel that has not entered his ninth year: (K:)<br>\
and sometimes it is metaphorically applied to a<br>\
human being; [meaning (tropical:)  a young man;] and<br>\
بَكْرَةٌ to (tropical:)  a young woman: (TA:) the pl. (of<br>\
pauc., S) is أَبْكُرٌ; (S, K;) and ↓ أُبَيْكِرُونَ occurs<br>\
as pl. of the dim. of أَبْكُرٌ; (S, TA;) and (pl. of<br>\
mult., S, TA) بِكَارٌ, (S, Msb,) like as فِرَاخٌ is pl.<br>\
of فَرْخٌ; (S;) or this is pl. of بَكْرَةٌ; (Msb, K;)<br>\
and there are other pls. of بَكْرٌ, namely, بُكْرَانٌ<br>\
(K) and بِكَارَةٌ; (S, Msb, K;) and [quasi-pl. n.]<br>\
↓ بَكَارَةٌ. (K.) Hence the well-known prov., (TA,)<br>\
صَدَقَنِى سِنَّ بَكْرِهِ, and سِنُّ بَكْرِهِ, meaning He hath<br>\
told me what is in his mind, and what his ribs<br>\
infold: a saying originating from the following<br>\
fact: a man bargained with another for a youthful<br>\
camel (بَكْر), and said, “What is his age (سِنُّهُ)? ”<br>\
the other answered, “He is in his ninth year: ”<br>\
then the young camel took fright and ran away:<br>\
whereupon his owner said to him, هِدَعْ هِدَعْ; and<br>\
this is an expression by which are quieted young<br>\
ones, (K,) of the camel; (TA;) so when the<br>\
purchaser heard it, he said, صدقنى سنّ بكره [He<br>\
hath told me truly the age, or as to the age, of his<br>\
youthful camel: or the age of his youthful camel<br>\
has spoken truly to me]: if سنّ is in the accus.<br>\
case, the meaning [of the verb] is عَرَّفَنِى, (K,)<br>\
and سنّ is in the accus. case as a second objective<br>\
complement; (TA;) or خَبَرَ سِنِّ is meant; [in<br>\
the CK, erroneously, خَبَرَ;] or فِى سِنِّ; the<br>\
prefixed noun [خَبَرَ] or the proposition [فِى]<br>\
being suppressed [and سنّ being therefore in the<br>\
accus. case]: but if سنّ is in the nom. case,<br>\
veracity is attributed to the [animal&#39;s] age, by an<br>\
amplification: (K:) or, as some say, the buyer<br>\
said to the owner of the camel, “How many<br>\
years has he? ” and he told him; and he looked<br>\
at the teeth of the camel, and found him to be as<br>\
he had said; whereupon he said, صدقنى سِنُّ بكره.<br>\
(Har p. 95.)<br>\
بُكْرٌ: see بَكْرٌ.<br>\
بِكْرٌ A virgin; (S, K;) and a man who has not<br>\
yet drawn near to a woman; (TA;) contr. of<br>\
ثَيِّبٌ, applied to a man as well as to a female:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) pl. أَبْكَارٌ. (S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\

bow when one first shoots with it. (TA.) And<br>\
(tropical:)  A cloud abounding with water: (K, TA:)<br>\

human beings; (TA;) the first-born of camels;<br>\

You say, هٰذَا بِكْرُ أَبَوَيْهِ (tropical:)  This is the first-born of<br>\

men is the first-born of a man and woman each a<br>\

-b7-  (assumed tropical:)  The first of anything; (K;) as<br>\
also ↓ بَاكُورَةٌ: (TA:) and (assumed tropical:)  an action that has<br>\

بِكْرٌ (tropical:)  A cutting blow or stroke, (S, K,) that kills<br>\
(K) at once, (TA,) not requiring to be struck a<br>\

in a trad., in which it is said that such were the<br>\
blows of &#39;Alee; (S, TA;) but in that trad., as<br>\
some recite it, the latter word is ↓ مُبْتَكِرَاتٌ. (TA.)<br>\
بَكَرٌ: see بُكْرَةٌ, in three places:<br>\
-A2-  and see also<br>\
بَكْرَةٌ.<br>\

hasten, (صَاحِبُ بُكُورٌ, S, or قَوِىٌّ عَلَى البُكُورِ, K,)<br>\
to do, or accomplish, the thing that he needs, or<br>\
wants: (S:) بَكُرٌ and بَكِرٌ [and بَكِيرٌ] are [said to<br>\
be] possessive epithets; for they have no simple<br>\
triliteral verb. (TA.) [But see 1, last sentence.]<br>\
بَكِرٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
بَكْرَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓بَكَرَةٌ (Msb, K) The<br>\
thing upon which [passes the rope wherewith] one<br>\

piece of wood, in the middle [of the circumference]<br>\
whereof is a groove (K, TA) for the rope, and in<br>\
the interior [or centre] whereof is an axis upon<br>\
which it turns: (TA:) or a quick مَحَالَة [or<br>\
large sheave of a pulley]: (M, K:) [but MF<br>\
disapproves of this last explanation: sometimes,<br>\
by a synecdoche, it is used to signify a pulley<br>\
complete:] the pl. is ↓ بَكَرٌ, (S, Msb, K,) a pl. of<br>\
the former, anomalous, like حَلَقٌ pl. of حَلْقَةٌ, and<br>\
حَمَأٌ pl. of حَمْأَةٌ, (S,) or of the latter; (Msb;) or<br>\
a coll. gen. n., of which بَكَرَةٌ is the n. un.; (MF;)<br>\

remaining behind, (S, TA;) they came all of<br>\

together, none remaining behind: (TA:) or they<br>\
came in succession, one after, or at the heels of,<br>\
another: (AO:) or they came in one way, or<br>\
manner: (As:) [accord. to some, from بكرة as<br>\
explained in the next preceding sentence; and, if<br>\
so, على is used in the sense of مَعَ, or مُشْتَمِلِينَ is<br>\
understood before it: or it is from بكرة signifying<br>\
“ a youthful she-camel; ” and thus implies that<br>\
they were few: (see Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i. 312:)<br>\
or] from بَكَّرْتُ فِى كَذَا meaning “ I was,” or<br>\
“ became,” or “ went,” “ before in such a thing; ”<br>\
so that it signifies that they came from first to<br>\
last: (IJ:) or from بكرة in the first of the senses<br>\
explained in this paragraph; though in this case<br>\
there is no بكرة in reality. (AO, S. *)<br>\
بُكْرَةٌ and ↓ بَكَرٌ The early morning, or first part of<br>\
the day; (Bd and Jel in xix. 12 and xxxiii. 41 and<br>\
xlviii. 9, as relating to the former word; and K; *)<br>\
between the time of the prayer of daybreak and sunrise; syn. غُدْوَةٌ; and ↓ إِبْكَارٌ is a subst. in the same<br>\
sense, (K,) accord. to the lexicologists, as Sb<br>\
says; but he adds that he holds it to be [only]<br>\
the inf. n. of أَبْكَرَ: (TA: [and the like is said in<br>\
the S with reference to its occurrence in the Kur<br>\
iii. 36 and xl. 57:]) pl. [of pauc.] of the first,<br>\
أَبْكَارٌ, and [of mult.] بُكَرٌ. (T, Msb.) You say,<br>\
أَتَيْتُهُ بُكْرَةٌ (S, A, Msb) and ↓ بَكَرًا, (A,) meaning<br>\
↓ بَاكِرٍا [I came to him early in the morning,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (S, A, Msb.) But if you mean the بُكْرَةٌ of<br>\
a particular day, you say, أَتَيْتُهُ بُكْرَةَ, making the<br>\
noun imperfectly decl.; [meaning I came to him<br>\
early in the morning, &amp;c., of this day;] and in<br>\
this case it is not to be used otherwise than as an<br>\
adv. n. of time. (S.) If you say ↓ بَاكِرًا, using<br>\
this word as an epithet, you use بَاكِرَة for the<br>\
fem. (TA.) You say also, سِرْ عَلَى فَرَسِكَ بُكْرَةً<br>\
and ↓ بَكَرًا [Go thou on thy horse early in the<br>\
morning, &amp;c.]; like as you say, سَحَرًا. (S, TA.<br>\
[But in two copies of the S, for سرْ, I find سِيرَ.])<br>\
بَكَرَةٌ: see بَكْرَةٌ.<br>\

and ↓ مُبْكِرٌ (K) (tropical:)  Rain that falls in the first of<br>\
its season: (A:) or that comes (TA) in the commencement of [the season of] the وَسْمِىّ [q. v.]:<br>\

the latter part of the night, in the first of its<br>\
season, bringing rain]: (A:) and ↓ سَحَابَةٌ مِبْكَارٌ<br>\

(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also بَكُورٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ بَكِيرَةٌ<br>\
