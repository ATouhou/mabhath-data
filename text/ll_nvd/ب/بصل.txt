تَبْصِيلٌ The act of stripping, or divesting;<br>\
[like as when one strips an onion (بَصَلَة) of its<br>\
coats;] (K;) as also ↓ تَبَصُّلٌ. (Fr, K.) You say,<br>\
بَصَّلْتُ الرَّجُلَ عِنْ ثِيَابِهِ [and ↓ تَبَصَّلْتُهُ] I stripped<br>\
the man of his clothes. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تبصّل It (a thing) was, or became, several<br>\
fold, or many fold, like the coats of the بَصَل [or<br>\
onion]. (Z, TA.) See also مُتَبّصِّلٌ.<br>\
-A2-  It is also<br>\
trans.: see 2, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] تَبَصَّلُوهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  They begged of him so much that all that he had<br>\
became exhausted. (Sgh, K.)<br>\
بَصَلٌ [The onion; allium cepa: or onions, collectively:] what it signifies is well known: n. un.<br>\
with ة. (S, M, Msb, K.) Hence the prov., أَكْسَى<br>\
مِنَ البَصَلِ [Having more coats, or coverings,<br>\
than the onion]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also Any kind of<br>\
bulb, or bulbous plant.] بَصَلُ الزَّعْفَرَانِ [The bulb<br>\
of the saffron], which is buried in the ground,<br>\
is like the بَصَل [or onion] commonly known.<br>\
(Mgh.) بَصَل الفَأْرِ is the same as الإِسْقِيلُ and<br>\
الإِسْقَالُ and العُنْصَلُ, (K in art. سقل,) also written<br>\
العُنْصُلُ, (K in art. عصل,) or بَصَلُ العنصل, (KL<br>\
voce زيزٌ, [and so as written by Golius,]) [Scilla,<br>\
or squill; particularly scilla maritima, or officinal<br>\
squill; called by all these names, except, perhaps,<br>\
السقال, in the present day;] also called زِيزٌ, and<br>\
البَصَلُ البَرِّىُّ [the wild onion; but from what follows, it seems that there is a confusion here].<br>\
(KL ubi suprà.) بَصَلُ الذِّئْبِ, and بصل الزير,<br>\
(Golius on the authority of Zeyn El-Attár,) or<br>\
بصل الرند, (so in the TA in art. بلبس,) i. q. بلبوس<br>\
Bulbus esculentus, (Golius, from Zeyn El-Attár,) or<br>\
البَلْبُوس, with fet-h, [thus generally written, though<br>\
it would seem to be correctly بُلْبُوس,] the leaves<br>\
of which resemble those of the سَذَاب [or rue]:<br>\
(TA in art. بلبس:) the بَلْبُوس is the wild onion<br>\
(in Pers. پِيَازْ صَحْرَائِى). (KL voce بلبوس. [This<br>\
last assertion suggests that الزير and الرند may be<br>\
mistranscriptions for الزِّيز; the زيز mentioned<br>\
before.]) [بَصَلُ القىْءَ Bulbus vomitorius; mentioned by Golius; and by Dioscorides, (l. ii. c. 201,)<br>\
as being emetic and diuretic.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (K,) or<br>\
بَصَلَةٌ, (M,) (tropical:)  A helmet (M, K) of iron, (K,)<br>\
pointed in the middle; so called as being likened<br>\
to what is first mentioned above. (M.) Lebeed<br>\
likens helmets to بَصَل. (S.)<br>\
مُتَبَصِّلٌ (ISh, K) and ↓ ذُو تَبَصُّلٍ (ISh, TA) A<br>\
covering of any kind (قِشْرٌ) consisting of many<br>\
coats; thick; (ISh, K;) like the coats of the<br>\
بَصَل [or onion]. (ISh, TA.)<br>\
