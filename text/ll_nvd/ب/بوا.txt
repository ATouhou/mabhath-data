بَآءَ إِلَيْهِ, (M, Mgh, * Msb, * K,) aor. يَبُوْءُ, (M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. بَوْءٌ, (M, Mgh,) He returned,<br>\
went back, or came back, (M, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
to it, (M, K, *) namely, a thing: (M:) or he<br>\
withdrew [from a person or persons, or a place,]<br>\
to it, or him; or, perhaps, he made himself solely<br>\
and peculiarly a companion, or an associate, to<br>\
him, or it; syn. اِنْقَطَعَ [q. v.]: (K:) but in<br>\
some copies of the K, the latter explanation is<br>\
connected with the former by وَ [and] instead of<br>\
أَو. (TA.) وَبَاؤُوا بِغَضَبٍ مِنَ اللّٰهِ [in the Kur<br>\
ii. 58 and iii. 108] means And they returned<br>\
with anger from God; (Akh, S, Bd in ii. 58,<br>\
and Jel in the same and in iii. 108;) i. e. the<br>\
anger of God came upon them: (Akh, S:) or<br>\
they returned deserving anger from God: (Bd<br>\
in iii. 108:) or they became deserving of anger<br>\
from God: from بَآءَ فُلَانٌ بِفُلَانٍ such a one was<br>\
deserving of being, or fit to be, slain in retaliation<br>\
for such a one, (Ksh and Bd in ii. 58,) because<br>\
his equal: (Ksh ibid.:) the primary signification<br>\
of بَوْءٌ being [said to be] that of equalling, or being<br>\
equal with. (Bd in ii. 58.) [See a similar phrase,<br>\
also from the Kur, below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  بُؤْتُ بِهِ إِلَيْهِ [I<br>\
returned with it to him: and hence,] I returned<br>\
it, took it back, or brought it back, to him; (M,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ أَبَأْتُهُ, (Th, M, K,) and بُؤْتُهُ, (Ks,<br>\
M, K,) but this last is rare. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  بَآءَ بِإِثْمِهِ,<br>\
aor. and inf. n. as above, (T, S,) signifies, accord.<br>\
to Akh, He returned [laden] with his sin: (S:)<br>\
or, accord. to As, he acknowledged it, or confessed<br>\
it: (T:) or, accord. to others, (TA,) بَآءَ بِذَنْبِهِ,<br>\
(T, * M, Msb, K,) aor. as above, inf. n. بَوْءٌ and<br>\
بَوَآءٌ, (M, K,) he bore, or took upon himself, the<br>\
burden of his sin, or crime, or offence; syn.<br>\
اِحْتَمَلَهُ; (Aboo-Is-hák, T, M, K, TA;) and became<br>\
[as though he were] the abiding-place thereof:<br>\
(TA:) or he became burdened, or laden, with it:<br>\
(Msb:) or he became, or made himself, answerable, responsible, or accountable, for it, by an<br>\
inseparable obligation; syn. اِلْتَزَمَ بِهِ; for the primary signification of بَوَآءٌ is [asserted to be] لُزُومٌ<br>\
[i. e. adhesion, &amp;c.]; and it is afterwards used in<br>\
every case [so as to imply a meaning of this<br>\
kind] according to the exigency of that case; as<br>\
is said in the Nh, and expressly stated by Z and<br>\
Er-Rághib: (TA:) or he acknowledged it, or<br>\
confessed it. (M, K.) إِنِّى أُرِيدُ أَنْ تَبُوْءَ بِإِثْمِى<br>\
وَ إِثْمِكَ, in the Kur v. 35, means Verily I desire<br>\
that thou return [laden] with the sin committed<br>\
against me in slaying me, and thy sin which thou<br>\
hast committed previously: (Jel:) or I desire<br>\
that thou shouldst bear (تَحْمِلَ) my sin if I were<br>\
to extend my hand towards thee, and thy sin in<br>\
extending thy hand towards me: or the sin committed against me in slaying me, and thy sin for<br>\
which thine offering was not accepted: and each<br>\
noun is in the place of a denotative of state; i. e.,<br>\
[it means] that thou return involved in the two<br>\
sins; bearing them: and perhaps the speaker may<br>\
have meant, if that must inevitably take place, I<br>\
desire that it may be thine act, not mine; so that<br>\
the real meaning is, that it should not be his, not<br>\
that it should be his brother&#39;s: or by the إِثْمٌ may<br>\
be meant the punishment thereof; for the desire<br>\
of the punishment of the disobedient is allowable:<br>\
(Bd:) accord. to Th, the meaning is, if thou<br>\
have determined upon slaying me, the sin will be<br>\
in thee, not in me. (M.) فَبَاؤُوا بِغَضَبٍ عَلَى غَضَبٍ<br>\
[in the Kur ii. 84] is explained by Aboo-Is-hák<br>\
as meaning So they bore the burden of anger<br>\
upon anger; syn. اِحْتَمَلُوا; this being said by him<br>\
to be the proper signification of the verb: or, as<br>\
some say, the meaning is, [they bore the burden<br>\
of] sin for which they deserved the fire [of Hell]<br>\
following upon sin for which they deserved the<br>\
same: or they returned [laden with anger upon<br>\
anger]: (T:) or they became deserving of anger<br>\
upon anger. (Ksh.) [See a similar phrase, also<br>\
from the Kur, above.] It is said in a form of<br>\
prayer, أَبُوْءُ إِلَيْكَ بِنِعْمَتِكَ, meaning I acknowledge,<br>\
or confess, to Thee thy favour [towards me, as<br>\
imposing an obligation upon me]. (Mgh.) You<br>\
say also, بَآءٌ بِحَقِّهِ; (S;) and بِدِّمِهِ; (M, K;) He<br>\
acknowledged, or confessed, [himself to be answerable, responsible, or accountable, for] his right,<br>\
due, or just claim; (S;) and so [for] his blood:<br>\
(M, K:) the verb expresses acknowledgment, or<br>\
confession, always of something for which its<br>\
agent is, as it were, indebted, or answerable; not<br>\
the contrary. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  بَآءَ بِكَفِّى, in a poem of<br>\
Sakhr-el-Gheí, means It [referring to a sword]<br>\
became in my hand; my hand became to it a<br>\
مَبَآءَة, i. e. مَأْوًى [or place of abode]; it returned,<br>\
and became in my hand: or, accord. to Ibn-<br>\
Habeeb, i. q. اِسْتَقَلَّ [app. a mistranscription for<br>\
اِسْتَقَرَّ it rested, or remained; the verb بآء in this<br>\
phrase being from بَوَآءٌ signifying لُزُومٌ, explained<br>\
above]. (Skr p. 16.)<br>\
-A2-  بَآءٌ also signifies It (a<br>\
thing, TA) suited, matched, tallied, corresponded,<br>\
or agreed. (K.) [Hence,] بَآءَ فُلَانٌ بِفُلَانٍ (inf. n.<br>\
بَوَآءٌ, TA) Such a one was the like, or equal, of<br>\
such a one, to be slain [in retaliation] for him:<br>\
(T:) or became his like, or equal, so that he was<br>\
slain [in retaliation] for him: (Mgh:) and was<br>\
slain for him, (AZ, T, S,) and his blood became a<br>\
compensation for the blood of the other: (T:) or<br>\
was deserving of being, or fit to be, slain in retaliation for him, (Ksh and Bd in ii. 58,) because his<br>\
equal: (Ksh ibid.:) or was slain for him, and so<br>\
became equal with him; (K, * TA;) as also ↓ أَبَآءَهُ,<br>\
and ↓ بَاوَأَهُ. (M, K.) One says, بُؤْبِهِ, i. e. Be<br>\
thou of such as are slain [in retaliation] for him.<br>\
(S.) And it is said in a prov., بَآءَتْ عَرَارِ بِكَحْلٍ<br>\
&#39;Arári became slain for Kahl: these were two<br>\
cows, which smote each other with their horns,<br>\
and both died: the proverb is applied to any two<br>\
that become equal. (S in this art.; and the same<br>\
and K in art. عر. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov. i. 151.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  بَآءَ دَمَهُ بِدَمِهِ, (T, * M, K,)<br>\
inf. n. بَوْءٌ and بَوَآءٌ, (M,) He made his blood equal<br>\
with [or an equivalent for] his [i. e. another&#39;s]<br>\
blood [by shedding the former in retaliation].<br>\
(M, K.) And بَآءَهُ, [or بَآءَهُ بِهِ,] (M,) or به ↓ أَبَآءَهُ,<br>\
(T, S,) and به ↓ اِسْتِبَآءَهُ, (S,) He slew him [in<br>\
retaliation] for him; (T, S, M;) i. e., the slayer<br>\
for the slain. (S.) فُلَانًا بِفُلَانٍ ↓ أَبَآءَ [He slew such<br>\
a one in retaliation for such a one] is said when<br>\
the Sultán has retaliated for a man upon another<br>\
man: and ↓ أَبَآءَهُ, inf. n. إِبَآءَةٌ, signifies he (the<br>\
Sultán, or another,) slew him in retaliation. (T.)<br>\
-A3-  بَآءَ signifies also He exalted himself, or was<br>\
proud: app. formed by transposition [of the second<br>\
and third radical letters, the ى being changed<br>\
into ا,] from بَأَى. (Fr, T.)<br>\
2<br>\
بوّأهُ مَنْزِلًا He lodged him in an abode; (Fr,<br>\
T, M, K;) as also بوّاهُ فِى مَنْزِلٍ, (M, K,) and<br>\
مَنْزِلًا ↓ ابآءهُ: (T, * M, K:) or, as also بوّأ لَهُ مَنْزِلًا,<br>\
(the latter mentioned by Fr, T,) he prepared for<br>\
him an abode, (S, Mgh,) and assigned, or gave,<br>\
him a place therein: (S:) and بَوَّأْتُهُ دارًا and بوّاتُ<br>\
لَهُ دارًا I lodged him in a house: (Msb:) and<br>\
بَوَّأْتُكَ بَيْتًا I took for thee a house: and ↓ تَبَوَّآ<br>\
لِقَوْمِكُمَا بِمِصْرَ بُيُوتًا [in the Kur x. 87] means take<br>\
ye two, for your people, in Egypt, houses: (Akh,<br>\
T:) or ↓ تَبَوُّؤٌ [or تَبَوُّؤُ مَكَانٍ] signifies a man&#39;s<br>\
putting a mark upon a place, when it pleases him,<br>\
that he may abide there: (El-&#39;Itreefee, T:) or<br>\
↓ تبوّأهُ he put it [a place] into a right, or proper,<br>\
state; and prepared it: (Sh, * T:) or بَيْتًا ↓ تبوّأ<br>\
he took a house as a place of abode, or as a dwelling: (Msb:) or مَنْزِلًا ↓ تبوّأ he looked for the<br>\
best place that could be seen, and the most level,<br>\
or even, and the best adapted by its firmness, for<br>\
his passing the night there, and took it as a place<br>\
of abode; (Fr, T;) or he took for himself a place<br>\
of abode; (T, Mgh;) or he alighted and sojourned<br>\
in a place of abode: and ↓ استبآءهُ he took it as a<br>\
مَبَآءَة [or place of abode]: (S:) and بوّأ المَكَانَ and<br>\
بِهِ ↓ ابآء (K) and ↓ تبوّأ [i. e. تبوّأ بِهِ] (Sh, T, K) he<br>\
alighted in the place, and stayed, or dwelt, in it:<br>\
(Sh, T, K:) or به ↓ ابآء he stayed, or dwelt, in it,<br>\
i. e., a place: (Akh, T:) and المَكَانَ ↓ تبوّأ he<br>\
alighted and abode in the place: (M:) [whence,<br>\
in the Kur lix. 9,] الدَّارَوَ الْإِيمَانَ ↓ وَالَّذِينَ تَبَوَّؤُوا<br>\
[and they who have made their abode in the City<br>\
of the Prophet and in the faith]; the faith being<br>\
likened to a place of abode; or the meaning may<br>\
be مَكَانَ الإِيمَانِ [the place of the faith]. (M.)<br>\
بَوَّأَهُمْ مَنْزِلًا (AZ, M) and منزلًا ↓ أَبَآءَهُمْ (AZ, TA)<br>\
also signify He alighted and abode with them by<br>\
the face, or front, of a mountain, where it rose<br>\
from its base, (AZ, M, TA,) or next to a river,<br>\
or brook. (AZ, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [Hence, (see بَآءَةِ,)] بوّأ<br>\
(inf. n. تَبْوِيْءٌ, K) (assumed tropical:)  Inivit [feminam]: and he<br>\
married [a woman]; took [her] in marriage: syn.<br>\
نَكَحَ: (M, K:) and also تَزَّوَجَ. (TA. [There<br>\
mentioned as a distinct signification.]) The verb<br>\
is trans. in these two senses. (TK.)<br>\
-A2-  بوّأ الرُمْحَ<br>\
نَحْوَهُ He directed the spear towards him; (T, S;)<br>\
and (T) confronted him with it; (T, M, K;) and<br>\
prepared it, or made it ready [to thrust it towards<br>\
him]. (TA.)<br>\

-b2-  ابآء الإِبِلَ, (T, S, O, L, and so in some<br>\
copies of the K, in other copies of which we find<br>\
ابآء بِالْإِبِلِ,) inf. n. إِبَآءَةٌ, (T,) He brought back the<br>\
camels to the مَبَآءَة (T, S, O, L) or مَعْطِن, (K,)<br>\
both of which signify the place where they are<br>\
made to lie down, at the watering-place. (L.)<br>\
And ابآء الإِبِلَ, (T, M,) inf. n. as above, (T,) He<br>\
made the camels to lie down [in the مَبَآءَة], one<br>\
beside another. (T, M.) And ابآء عَلَيْهِ مَالَهُ He<br>\
drove back, or brought back, to their nightly<br>\
resting-place, for him, his cattle, (S, M, TA,)<br>\
i. e., his camels, or his sheep or goats. (S, TA.)<br>\
And [hence,] أَبَآءَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَعَمًا لَا يَسَعُهَا المُرَاحُ<br>\
[God bestowed upon them cattle (i. e. camels &amp;c.)<br>\
which the nightly resting-place thereof would not<br>\
contain]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 2, in four places. ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
ابآء الأَدِيمَ He put the skin, or hide, into the<br>\
tanning liquid. (K.) In the O, the action is<br>\

-b3-  See also 10.<br>\
6<br>\
تَبَاوَآ They two (namely, two slain men, M)<br>\
became equal [by being slain, one in retaliation<br>\
for the other]. (M, K.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
أَمَرَهُمْ أَنْ يَتَبَاوَؤُوا; incorrectly related as being<br>\
يَتَبآءَوْا; (S, Mgh;) meaning He (the Prophet)<br>\
ordered them that they should be equal in retaliation, in their fighting: (Mgh:) the occasion of<br>\
the order was this: there was a conflict between<br>\
two tribes of the Arabs, and one of the two tribes<br>\
had superior power over the other, so they said,<br>\
“ We will not be content unless we slay, for the<br>\
slave of our party, the free of their party; and for<br>\
the woman, the man: ” A&#39;Obeyd holds the former<br>\
reading to be the right. (T.)<br>\

استبآءهُ: see 2. ―<br>\
-b2-  In the following verse of<br>\
Zuheyr Ibn-Abee-Sulmà,<br>\
وَلَمْ أَرَجَارَ بَيْتٍ يُسْتَبَآءُ  فَلَمْ أَرَ مَعْشَرًا أَسَرُوا هَدِيًّا<br>\
ISk says that the هَدِىّ is one who is entitled to<br>\
respect, or honour, or protection; and that يستبآء<br>\
is syn. with ↓ يُتَبَوَّأُ, meaning whose wife is taken<br>\
as a wife [by another man]: but Aboo-&#39;Amr EshSheybánee says that يستبآء is from البَوَآءُ, meaning<br>\
“ retaliation: ” [and accord. to this interpretation,<br>\
which is the more probable, the verse may be<br>\
rendered, And I have not seen a company of men<br>\
who have made captive one entitled to respect, or<br>\
honour, or protection, nor have I seen one who<br>\
has begged the protection of the people of a house,<br>\
or of a tent, slain in retaliation:] for, he says,<br>\
he came to them desiring to beg their protection,<br>\
and they took him, and slew him in retaliation<br>\
for one of themselves. (T.) See 1, near the end<br>\
of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b3-  اِسْتَبَأْتُ الحَكَمَ, and بِالْحَكَم, I<br>\
asked the judge to retaliate upon a slayer; to slay<br>\
the slayer for the slain. (M.)<br>\
بَآءٌ: see بَآءَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  A libidinous man. (TA in باب<br>\

-A3-  The name of the letter ب, q. v.;<br>\
as also بَا: pl. of the former بَآءَاتٌ; and of the<br>\
latter أَبْوَآءٌ. (TA ubi suprà.) The dim. is بُيَيَّةٌ,<br>\
meaning A little ب: and a ب faintly pronounced:<br>\
[and app. بُوَيَّةٌ also, as the medial radical is generally held to be و:] and in like manner is formed<br>\
the dim. of every similar name of a letter. (Lth,<br>\
on the letter حَآء, in TA, باب الالف اللينّة.)<br>\
بَآءَةٌ: see مَبَآءَةٌ, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  Also, (T, S,<br>\
M, Mgh, Msb, K,) and ↓ بَآءٌ, (IAar, T, S, M, K,)<br>\
and بَاهَةٌ, with the ء changed into ه, (TA,) and بَاهٌ,<br>\
(IAar, T, Msb,) with ا and ه, but IKt asserts this<br>\
last to be a mistranscription, (Msb, TA,) [though<br>\
it is of very frequent occurrence,] and IAmb says<br>\
that بَآءَةٌ is sing., or n. un., of بَآءٌ, and بَآءٌ [or بَآءَةٌ]<br>\
has for pl. بَآءَاتٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  Coïtus conjugalis: and<br>\
marriage: syn. جِمَاعٌ (T, Msb) and نِكَاحٌ (As,<br>\
Fr, T, S, M, Mgh, K) and تَزْوِيجٌ: (T:) from بَآءَةٌ<br>\
signifying a place of abode; [see مَبَآءَةٌ;] (T, S, *<br>\
Mgh, Msb;) because it is generally in a place of<br>\
abode; (Mgh, Msb;) or because the man possesses<br>\
mastery, or authority, and power, over his wife,<br>\
like as he possesses the same over his house: (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb: see 5:) بَآءَةٌ is applied [also] to the<br>\
marriage-contract; because he who takes a woman<br>\
in marriage lodges her in a place of abode. (T.)<br>\
[See also بَاهٌ, in art. بوه.] It is said in a trad.,<br>\
مَنِ اسْتَطَاعَ مِنْكُمُ البَآءَ ةَ فَلْيَتَزَّوجْ He who is able, of<br>\
you, to marry, let him marry: (T:) or a prefixed<br>\
noun is here suppressed; the meaning being, he<br>\
who finds [or is able to procure] the provisions<br>\
(مُؤَن) of marriage, let him marry. (Msb, TA.)<br>\
And one says, فُلَانٌ حَرِيصٌ عَلَى البَآءَةِ Such a one<br>\
is vehemently desirous of marriage. (As, T.)<br>\
بِيْئَةٌ a subst. from بَوَّأَهُ مَنْزِلًا. (M, K.) [See 2;<br>\
and] see also مَبَآءَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  A mode, or manner, of<br>\
taking for oneself a place of abode: (M:) and<br>\
[hence,] a state, or condition. (AZ, T, S, M, K.)<br>\
You say, إِنَّهُ لَحَسَنُ البِيْئَةِ Verily he has a good<br>\
mode, or manner, of taking for himself a place of<br>\
abode: (M:) or verily he is of good state or<br>\
condition. (S.) And بَاتَ بِبِيْئَةِ He passed the<br>\
night in an evil state or condition (AZ, T, S, * M.)<br>\
بَوَآءٌ Equal; equivalent; like; alike; a match;<br>\
(Akh, T, S, M, Mgh, K;) and particularly, if<br>\
slain in retaliation for another. (M.) It is applied to one, and to two, and to more: so that<br>\
you say, فُلَانٌ بَوَآءٌ فُلَانٌ Such a one is the equal,<br>\
&amp;c., of such a one if slain in retaliation for him:<br>\
(M:) and هُوَ بَوَآءٌ He is an equal, &amp;c.; and so هِىَ<br>\
she: and هُمْ بَوَآءٌ They are equals, &amp;c.; and so هُنَّ<br>\
they, referring to females: (Mgh:) and هُمْ بَوَآءٌ<br>\
فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ They are equals in this affair. (T.)<br>\
Hence, in a trad. of &#39;Alee, respecting witnesses,<br>\
إَذَ كَانُوا بَوَآءٌ When they are equals in number<br>\
and rectitude. (Mgh.) And مَا فُلَانٌ لِفُلَانٍ بِبَوَآءٌ<br>\
Such a one is not an equal, &amp;c., to such a one.<br>\
(T.) And دَمُ فُلَانٍ بَوَآءٌ لِدَمِ فُلَانٍ The blood of<br>\
such a one is an equivalent for the blood of such a<br>\
one. (S.) And الجِرَاحَاتُ بَوَآءٌ Wounds are to be<br>\
retaliated equally: a trad. (T, Mgh.) And<br>\
القَوْمُ عَلَى بَوَآءِ The people, or company of men,<br>\
are in a state of equality. (T.) And قُسِمَ المَالُ<br>\
بَيْنَهُمْ عَلَى بَوَآءٍThe property was divided among<br>\
them equally. (T. [A similar ex. is given in the<br>\
Mgh, and explained in the same manner; but<br>\
there I find عَنْ بَوَآءٍ; perhaps a mistranscription.])<br>\
And كَلَّمْنَاهُمْ فَأَجَابُوا عَنْ بَوَآءٍ وَاحِدٍ [in a copy of<br>\
the M عَلَى بوآء واحد] We spoke to them, and<br>\
they replied with one reply: (T, S, O, K: *) i. e.,<br>\
their reply was not discordant: عَنْ being here<br>\
used in the sense of بِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Retaliation. (T.) [See 1, near the end of the paragraph:<br>\
as well as in other places.] It is related in a trad.,<br>\
that Jaafar Es-Sádik, being asked the reason of<br>\
the rage of the scorpion against the sons of Adam,<br>\
said, تُرِيدُ البَوَآءَ [It desires retaliation]; i. e., it<br>\
hurts like as it is hurt. (TA.)<br>\
