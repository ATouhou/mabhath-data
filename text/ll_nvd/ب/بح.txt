S, L, K,) and ISd says, I see, or think, that Lh<br>\
has mentioned يَبْحَحُ, which is extr. with respect<br>\
to rule, (TA,) inf. n. بَحَحٌ; (ISk, S, L, K;) and<br>\
first pers. بَحَحْتُ, (AO, T, S, K,) but the former<br>\

and يَبِعُّ and يَبُعُّ, [which last is contr. to analogy,]<br>\
(L,) inf. n. بَعُّ (AO, S, K) and بَحَحٌ and بَحَاحٌ<br>\
and بُحُوحٌ and بَحَاحَةٌ and بُحُوحَةٌ; (K;) He<br>\
had a hoarse, rough, harsh, or gruff, voice; (L;)<br>\
he was taken with a hoarseness, harshness, roughness, or gruffness, of the voice. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is<br>\
tropically used in speaking of inanimate things;<br>\

or midst, [which is the best part,] of the دار [i. e.<br>\
abode, or district, or country, &amp;c.], (K, TA,) and<br>\
became possessed of mastery, dominion, or authority, and power, over it. (TA.) Fr, however,<br>\
makes تَبَحْبُحٌ to be from ٰالبَاحَةُ [q. v.], not from<br>\
a reduplicative root. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تبحبح also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, settled, or established,<br>\
in authority and power, (syn. تَمَكَّنَ,) in alighting,<br>\
and taking up his abode, or sojourning; (S, K,<br>\
TA;) and was, or became, [established] in the<br>\
middle, or midst, [or best part,] of the place of<br>\
abode; (TA;) and so ↓ بحبح. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
(tropical:)  He took a wide, an ample, or a large, range.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence,] تبحبح الحَيَا (assumed tropical:)  The rain became of<br>\
wide extent, and had influence upon the land. (TA,<br>\
from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And تَبَحْبَحَتِ العَرَبُ فِى لُغَاتِهَا<br>\
(tropical:)  The Arabs were copious, or took a wide range,<br>\
in their dialects. (A.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And تبحبح فِى المَجْدِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He became in an ample state of glory, honour,<br>\
or dignity. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  An Arab of the desert said,<br>\
of a woman in labour, تَرَكْتُهَا تَبَحْبَحُ عَلَى أَيْدِى<br>\
القَوَابِلِ [app. (assumed tropical:)  I left her obtaining delivery by<br>\
the hands of the midwives]. (AZ, TA.)<br>\
بُحَّةٌ: see أَبَحُّ.<br>\
بُحَّةٌ (S, A, L, K) and ↓ بُحَاحٌ (L) Hoarseness,<br>\
roughness, harshness, or gruffness, of the voice;<br>\
(E, K;) which is sometimes natural: or the former<br>\
is applied absolutely, and the latter to that which<br>\
arises from disease. (L.) You say, فِى صَوْتِهِ بُحَّةٌ<br>\
[In his voice is hoarseness, &amp;c.]. (S, A.)<br>\
بُحَاحٌ: see بُحَّةٌ.<br>\
بَحْبَحِىٌّ (assumed tropical:)  Ample in expenditure: and having<br>\
an ample place of abode. (Fr, K.)<br>\
بُحْبُوحٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
بُحْبُوحَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  The middle, or midst, [or best part,]<br>\
syn. وَسَطٌ, (A&#39;Obeyd, S, A, K,) of an abode, or a<br>\
district, or country, (S, A,) or a place, (K,) and<br>\
of a place where one alights and abides, (TA,)<br>\
and of Paradise, and of anything, and the best<br>\
part thereof; (A&#39;Obeyd, TA;) [like وَسَطٌ, by<br>\
which it is explained; because what is between<br>\
the two extremes is generally the best: it may be<br>\
well rendered the heart, or very heart, of a thing;]<br>\
and ↓ بُحْبُوحٌ, also, has the former of these significations [and by implication the other likewise].<br>\
(TA, voce بُؤْبُؤٌ, where see an ex.) Jereer says,<br>\
قَوْمِى تَمِيمٌ هُمُ القَوْمُ الذَّينَ هُمُ<br>\
يَنْفُونَ تَغْلِبَ عَنْ بُحْبُوحَةِ الدَّارِ<br>\
[My people are Temeem: they are the people who<br>\
drive away Teghlib from the middle, or best part,<br>\
of the country]. (S.) [It is said in the A, that<br>\
this word, as syn. with وَسَطٌ, in relation to an<br>\
abode or the like (دار), is tropical; but I see no<br>\
reason for this, unless by وسط be meant the “best<br>\
part.”]<br>\
أَبَحٌّ, applied to a man, (S, L, K,) or أَبَحٌّ الصَّوْتِ,<br>\
(A,) Having a hoarse, rough, harsh, or gruff,<br>\

thick, chord of a lute; syn. بَمُّ; because of its<br>\
rough sound. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  (tropical:)  A [gold coin of the kind<br>\
called] دِينَار; (K, TA;) because of its harsh<br>\
sound [when one rings it]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  (tropical:)  A قِدْح<br>\
[or gaming-arrow] (S, K, TA) by means of which<br>\
lots, or portions, are divided: (S, TA:) pl. بُحٌّ:<br>\
(S, K:) or such an arrow that has no sound.<br>\
(TA.) Khufáf Ibn-Nudbeh says,<br>\
قَرَوْا أَضْيَافَهُمْ رَبَحًا بِبُحٍّ<br>\
يَعِيشُ بِفَضْلِهِنَّ الحَىُّ سُمْرِ<br>\
[They entertained their guests with young weaned<br>\
she-camels, on the superabundant remains of<br>\
which the tribe lived, by means of tawny-coloured<br>\
gaming-arrows whereby the lots that determined<br>\
who should afford the entertainment were divided:<br>\
or, accord. to the TA, ربحا here signifies fat, as<br>\
a subst.; but this is inconsistent with the affixed<br>\
pronoun relating to it]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  Fat, as an<br>\
epithet, not a subst. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  كِسْرٌ أَبَحُّ (assumed tropical:)  [A portion of a limb, &amp;c.,] having much fat. (TA.)<br>\
