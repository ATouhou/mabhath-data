Msb, K,) but the former alone is mentioned by<br>\
Th in the Fs, and is the chaste word, (TA,)<br>\
arabicized, from the Persian بَاهَا, (S,) A sort, or<br>\
species, (S, K,) of food, or viands. (S.) Hence<br>\
the saying, اِجْعَلِ البَأْجَات بَإْجاً وَاحِدًا [Make thou<br>\
the sorts, or species, of food, or viands, to be one<br>\
sort, or species]: (S, K:) occurring in a trad., in<br>\
which it is without ء in each case, accord. to<br>\
IDrst: several different sorts of food being brought<br>\
to &#39;Omar, he asked respecting them, and it was<br>\
said, [They are] سِكْبَاج and زِرْبَاج and إِسْفِيدْبَاج;<br>\
whereupon he ordered that the bowls should be<br>\
brought, and their contents were emptied into<br>\
one; he saying the words above. (Marginal note<br>\
in a copy of the S.) IKh says that a man would<br>\
bring various sorts [of food], and one would say,<br>\
اِجْعَلْهَا بأْجاً وَاحدِا [Make thou them to be one<br>\
sort]. (TA.) The pl. is [بَأْجَاتٌ, as shown above,<br>\
as though the sing. were بَأْجَةٌ, and] أَبْوَاجٌ. (Msb,<br>\
TA.) لَأَجْعَلَنَّ النَّاسَ كُلَّهُمْ بَأْجًا وَاحِدًا is [likewise]<br>\
a saying of &#39;Omar, (Msb, TA,) meaning [I will<br>\
assuredly make the people, all of them, to be] one<br>\
body or assemblage; بَأْجٌ signifying a state of<br>\
assembling, or collecting together: (Kz, TA:) or<br>\
[of] one uniform way or mode or manner, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) as El-Fihree says in the Expos. of the<br>\
Fs, on the authority of ISd in the book entitled<br>\
El-&#39;Awees; (TA;) i. e., in respect of gifts, or<br>\
allowances: (Msb:) accord. to IAar, it is from<br>\
بَأْجٌ or بَاجٌ signifying a uniform line of road.<br>\
(TA.) You say also, النَّاسُ بَأْجٌ وَاحِدٌ The people<br>\
are [as] one thing. (TA.) And هُمْ فِى أَمْرٍ بَأْجٍ<br>\
They are [in one and the same, or] in an equal,<br>\
or a uniform, case. (K.) And جَعَلَ الكَلَامَ بَأْجاً<br>\
وَاخِدًا He made the speech, or language, to be<br>\
[uniform, or] of one mode, or manner. (TA.)<br>\
And اِجْعَلْ هٰذا الشَّىْءَ بَأْجًا وَاحِدًا Make thou this<br>\
thing to be [uniform, or] of one way, or mode, or<br>\
manner. (ISk.) And اِجْعَلِ الأَمْرَ بَأْجًا وَاحِدًا<br>\
Make thou the affair, or case, [uniform, or] one<br>\
uniform thing. (Fr.)<br>\
