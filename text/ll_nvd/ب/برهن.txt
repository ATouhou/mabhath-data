Q. 1<br>\
بَرْهَنَ He adduced,<br>\
(T, Z, Msb,) or established, (S, K, and Ham p. 7,)<br>\
the بُرْهَان, (T, Z, Msb, K,) i. e. the evidence or<br>\
proof [&amp;c.]; (T, S, Msb, &amp;c.;) or he adduced<br>\
his evidence or proof [&amp;c.]; (T, Msb;) عَلَيْهِ<br>\
[against him, or it, or (as in اِسْتَدَلَّ عَلَيْهِ) of it],<br>\
(S, K, and Ham p. 7,) and لَهُ [to him, or for<br>\
him]: (Ham ubi suprà:) but this verb is said<br>\
by Az and Z, on the authority of IAar, to be<br>\
post-classical; the correct word, they say, being<br>\
أَبْرَهَ: (Msb:) this they assert on the ground of<br>\
the opinion that بُرْهَانٌ [q. v.] is of the measure<br>\
فُعْلَانٌ; but J holds the ن to be a radical. (TA.)<br>\
بُرْهَانٌ An evidence, or a proof: (T, S, Msb, K,<br>\
and Ham p. 7:) and a demonstration; i. e. the<br>\
manifestation of an evidence or proof: (Msb:)<br>\
or a decisive and manifest evidence or proof:<br>\
(TA:) or the firmest, strongest, or most valid,<br>\
evidence or proof; which is such as ever necessarily implies truth, or veracity, as its consequence,<br>\
or concomitant; for evidences, or proofs, are of<br>\
five sorts; whereof this is one; another is that<br>\
which ever necessarily implies falsity, or falsehood, as its consequence, or concomitant; another,<br>\
that which is nearer to truth, or veracity; another,<br>\
that which is nearer to falsity, or falsehood; and<br>\
another, that which is intermediate between these<br>\
two: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [pl. بَرَاهِينُ:] some say<br>\
that the ن in this word is augmentative; (Msb, and<br>\
Ham p. 7;) that it is of the measure فُعْلَانٌ, from<br>\
البره [app. البَرْهُ] signifying the “act of cutting:”<br>\
(Ham ubi suprà:) others, that it is radical: Az<br>\
mentions both of these opinions: J confines<br>\
himself to the latter opinion: Z, to the former,<br>\
saying, on the authority of IAar, that the word<br>\
is derived from بَرَهْرَهَةٌ, meaning “white,” [or<br>\
“fair in complexion,”] applied to a girl: (Msb:)<br>\
Abu-l-Fet-h [i. e. IJ] says that he holds it to be<br>\
of the measure فُعْلَالٌ, like قُرْطَاسٌ and قُرْنَاسٌ, the<br>\
ن not being augmentative, as is shown by the<br>\
verb above mentioned: (Ham ubi suprà:) but [it<br>\
has been stated above that] this verb is said, on<br>\
the authority of IAar, to be post-classical. (Msb,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
