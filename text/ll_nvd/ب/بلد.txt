he was overtaken by confusion, or perplexity,<br>\

conventional adventitious application: (&#39;Ináyeh,<br>\
TA:) and the latter, a land, country, or territory,<br>\
[belonging to, or inhabited by, a people,] syn.<br>\
أَرْضٌ: (S, TA: [a meaning assigned in the K to<br>\

you say, هٰذِهِ بَلْدَتُنَا [This is our land, &amp;c.] like<br>\

also, cities, towns, or villages]. (T.) البَلَدُ and<br>\
↓ البَلْدَةُ are names applied to Mekkeh; (M, K;)<br>\
in like manner as النَّجْمُ is a name applied to the<br>\

abandons in the place where it lays it, in the<br>\
sand, or in a desert: (M, L:) also called ↓ البَلَدِيَّةِ<br>\
and ذَاتُ البَلَدِ. (M.) You say, فُلَانٌ بَيْضَةُ البَلَدِ<br>\
[(tropical:)  Such a one is like the egg of the ostrich, &amp;c.],<br>\
meaning such a one is unequalled, or unparalleled:<br>\
said in dispraise and in praise: (M, * L:) allowed<br>\
by A&#39;Obeyd to be used in praise: and said by<br>\
El-Bekree to be applied to him who is separated<br>\
from his family and near relations. (TA.) [See<br>\
also art. بيض.] You also say, هُوَ أَذَلُّ مِنْ بَيْضَةِ<br>\
البَلَدِ (S, M, A) (tropical:)  He is more object, or vile, than<br>\
the egg of the ostrich, which it abandons (S, TA)<br>\

بَيْضَةِ البَلَدِ (tropical:)  [He is more highly esteemed than the<br>\
egg of the ostrich, which it lays in the sand];<br>\
because the ostrich spreads its wings over it and<br>\
sits upon it. (A in art. فرخ.) [See more in art.<br>\
بيض.] ―<br>\
-b2-  A trace, mark, or vestige, (T, S, M, K,<br>\

of a thing. (Th, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also the next<br>\
paragraph, in three places: ―<br>\
-b5-  and see بُلْدَةٌ.<br>\
بَلْدَةٌ: see بَلَدٌ, in three places. You say, إِنْ لَمْ<br>\
تَفْعَلْ كَذَا فَهِىَ بَلْدَةٌ بَيْنِى وَ بَيْنِكَ (tropical:)  If thou do not<br>\
thus, it will be [a cause of] separation between<br>\
me and thee; (M, * A, TA;) i. e., I will alienate<br>\
thee from me so that a country, or region, shall<br>\
separate us, each from the other. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also A desert, or waterless desert, in which one<br>\

place, in which there was no one beside. (M.)<br>\

of the sky, (K,) containing no stars, (M, K,) or<br>\
containing only small stars, (T, * M,) between the<br>\
نَعَائِم and سَعْد الذَّابِح: (M, K:) sometimes the<br>\
moon declines from it, and takes as its mansion<br>\
the قِلَادَة: it [app. القلادة, accord. to the K, but<br>\
accord. to the TA البلدة,] consists of six stars<br>\
resembling a bow, (K,) in the sign of Sagittarius<br>\
(القَوْس): (T:) or البلدة is one of the Mansions<br>\
of the Moon, consisting of six stars of Sagittarius<br>\

of the year: (S:) [see مَنَازِلُ القَمَر, in art. نزل:<br>\
in the K it is also said that ↓ البَلَدُ is a Mansion<br>\
of the Moon; but this appears to be a mistake,<br>\
occasioned by the accidental omission of the word<br>\
البَلْدَةُ; though البَلَدُ would seem to be an appropriate name for the mansion next after the نعائم:]<br>\
IF says that البَلْدَةُ is a star, or an asterism,<br>\
(نَجْمٌ,) said to be the بَلْدَة, i. e. breast, of the<br>\
Lion; not meaning the mansion thus called in<br>\
the sign of Sagittarius: El-Hareeree finds fault<br>\
with him for using this expression, [the بلدة of<br>\
the Lion,] but Ibn-Dhafr replies that it occurs<br>\
in the language. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  بَلْدَةٌ also signifies<br>\
The earth, or ground. (S.) ―<br>\

wide in the breast. (S.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also (tropical:)  The palm of the<br>\
hand. (M, A, TA. [In the K, by the accidental<br>\
