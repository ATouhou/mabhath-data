خَذَمَهُ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
خَذِمَ, (K,) inf. n. خَذْمٌ, (JK,<br>\
S, TA,) He cut it, or cut it off: (S, K:) or he did<br>\
so quickly: (JK, Z, TA:) and ↓ خذّمهُ and<br>\
↓ تخذّمهُ signify the same: (K:) or ↓ the second,<br>\
inf. n. تَخْذِيمٌ, he cut it in pieces; (S, in which<br>\
only the inf. n. is mentioned;) and so ↓ the third.<br>\
(TA.) [It is like جَذَمَهُ.] Hence, in a trad.,<br>\
خَذَمُوا بِالسُّيُوفِ, said of men stopping the road,<br>\
and robbing and slaying passengers, They cut,<br>\
and smote, men with the swords. (TA.) And<br>\
خَذَمَ لَهُ مِنْ مَالِهِ خِذْمَةً He cut off for him a<br>\
portion of his property. (JK.) ―<br>\

a hawk, He struck him, or it, with his talon, or<br>\
claw. (IAar, K. *)<br>\
-A2-  خَذِمَ, aor.<br>\
خَذَمَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
خَذْمٌ, (TK, [as indicated in the K by its being<br>\
said that the verb is like سَمِعَ,]) It became cut,<br>\
or cut off; as also ↓ تخذّم: (K:) [or] the latter<br>\
is quasi-pass. of خَذَّمَهُ [and therefore signifies it<br>\
became cut in pieces]. (TA.) And خَذِمَتِ النَّعْلُ<br>\
The [thong called] شِسْع [q. v.] of the sandal became cut, or severed. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  خَذِمَ, aor.<br>\
خَذَمَ,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. خَذَمٌ (S, TA) [and app. خَذَمَانٌ, q. v.<br>\
infrà]; or خَذَمَ, [so in the JK, which may be<br>\
also correct, agreeably with the primary signification of this verb, though the aor. is there said<br>\
to be<br>\
خَذَمَ, which may perhaps be a mistranscription<br>\
for<br>\
خَذِمَ,] inf. n. خَذْمٌ [there mentioned in two places]<br>\
and خَذَمٌ; (JK;) (tropical:)  He was quick (JK, S, K,<br>\
TA) in pace, or rate of going; (JK, S, TA;) as<br>\
also ↓ اخذم. (JK. [But this last may be erroneously taken from the phrase مَرَّ مُخْذِمًا, there<br>\
immediately following; for this phrase may be<br>\
mistranscribed for مَرَّ يَخْذَمُ, which I find in the<br>\
TA.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,] خَذَمٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  [The<br>\
being liberal, or bountiful; (see the part. n.<br>\
خَذِمٌ;) or] the giving a gift, or making a present.<br>\
(KL.)<br>\

also ↓ خَذُومٌ (JK, K) and ↓ مِخْذَمٌ; (JK, T, S,<br>\

the sword of El-Hárith El-Ghassánee. (TA.) ―<br>\
