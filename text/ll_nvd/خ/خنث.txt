men and what is proper to women, (S, Mgh, K,)<br>\
together; (S, K;) one who has, by creation, the<br>\
anterior pudendum of a man and that of a<br>\
woman: (Msb:) in the language of the lawyers,<br>\
one who has what are proper to both sexes; or<br>\
who has neither that of a man nor that of a<br>\
woman: but some of them say that the former<br>\
meaning is the proper one; and that he who has<br>\
no external organ of generation is adjoined to the<br>\
class of the خنثى as being subject to the same<br>\
special laws: (MF, TA:) the pl. is خَنَاثَى (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K) and خِنَاثٌ. (Msb, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
The plant called بَرْوَاقٌ [i. e. the asphodel]. (K in<br>\

أَخْنَثُ مِنْ دَلَالِ [More effeminate, or more incapable of venery, than Delál]: a prov. (S, TA.)<br>\
Delál was a certain man of El-Medeeneh, (TA,)<br>\
who was made a eunuch, together with several<br>\
other مُخَنَّثُون. (TA in art. دل. [See Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Arab. Prov. i. 451; where the name is erroneously written دَلَّال.])<br>\
مُخَنَّثٌ, from خَنَّثَ “he bent,” (S, K,) because<br>\
of his softness, delicacy, tenderness, flabbiness,<br>\
laxness, or limberness, and affectation of languor,<br>\
or languidness; (TA;) or from خُنْثَى; (Kh,<br>\
JK, MS;) An effeminate man; (T in art. انث,<br>\
and TA;) one who resembles a woman in gentleness, and in softness of speech, and in an affectation of languor of the limbs: (TA voce مُؤَنَّثٌ,<br>\
q. v.: [see also خَنِثٌ:]) it is written thus and<br>\
↓ مُخَنِّثٌ: (TA:) this latter is explained by some<br>\
as meaning one who makes his speech like that of<br>\
women, in softness and gentleness: (Msb, TA:)<br>\
it is also said that both these epithets are used to<br>\
signify one who affects languor, or languidness,<br>\
of the limbs; one who makes himself like women<br>\
in the bending of himself, and in affecting<br>\
languor, or languidness, and in speech: but that<br>\
one uses the latter epithet only when he means<br>\
one who does what is excessively foul, or obscene;<br>\
[i. e. a catamite; though this is a meaning often<br>\
borne by the former also;] notwithstanding that<br>\
تَخْنِيثٌ, as signifying the “committing such an<br>\
action,” was unknown to the Arabs [of the<br>\
classical ages], and is not found in their language: (MF, TA:) [often, also,] the former<br>\
epithet signifies a man incapable of venery:<br>\
(MA:) it is said in a trad. that they used to<br>\
reckon the مخنّث as one of those having no need<br>\
of نِكَاح. (TA in art. ارب.) The مُخَنَّث is also<br>\
called ↓ خُنَاثَةُ and ↓ خُنَيْثَةُ [each imperfectly decl.].<br>\
