خَبَطَ, aor.<br>\
خَبِطَ, (Msb, K, TA,) inf. n. خَبْطٌ,<br>\
(Msb, TA, &amp;c.,) He struck, or beat, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
anything: (TA:) or he struck, or beat, it, or<br>\
him, vehemently: (M, K, TA:) or خَبْطٌ signifies<br>\
a camel&#39;s striking, or beating, a thing with his<br>\
fore foot: (T, TA:) or in the cases of beasts,<br>\
(دَوَابّ, [generally meaning horses and mules and<br>\
asses,]) the striking, or beating, with the fore<br>\
feet; not with the hind feet: and in the case<br>\
of the camel, with the fore foot and the hind<br>\
foot: or vehement treading; or of the fore feet<br>\
of beasts (دوابّ): (TA:) or, accord. to the<br>\
Keshsháf, the act of striking, or beating, in a way<br>\
that is not right: or, as some say, the going,<br>\
or journeying, upon what is not the middle, or<br>\
main part, of the road, or what is not the main<br>\
road, or upon a road not open to view: or continuous, or consecutive, striking, or beating, in<br>\
different ways: and afterwards tropically applied<br>\
to any (tropical:)  beating, or striking, that is not approved:<br>\
or originally, the striking, or beating, with the<br>\
fore foot or the hind foot, and the like: (MF,<br>\
TA:) with the fore feet or legs, it is like رَمْحٌ<br>\
with the hind feet or legs. (TA.) You say, of<br>\
a camel, خَبَطَ الأَرْضَ, (Msb,) or خَبَطَ الأَرْضَ بِيَدِهِ,<br>\
(S, K,) inf. n. as above, (S,) He struck, or beat,<br>\
the ground with his fore foot: (S, Msb:) or he<br>\
struck, or beat, vehemently the ground with his<br>\
fore foot; and ↓ تخبّط and ↓ اختبط signify the<br>\
same: (K:) it is said in the O that خَبَطَهُ signifies he struck him with his fore foot, or hand,<br>\
and prostrated him, as also ↓ تخبّطهُ: and ↓ اختبط,<br>\
said of a camel, is syn. with خَبَطَ: and in the<br>\
T, that بِرِجْلِهِ ↓ تَخَبَّطَنِى is syn, with خَبَطَنِى.<br>\
(TA.) Hence the trad., لَا تَخْبِطُوا خَبْطَ الجَمَلِ<br>\
[lit. Ye shall not beat the ground as the camel<br>\
does with his fore foot in rising]; meant to forbid<br>\
a man&#39;s putting forward his foot in rising from<br>\
prostration [in prayer]. (TA.) And خَبَطَهُ, (K,<br>\
TA,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,) signifies<br>\
also He trod him, or it, vehemently, (K, TA,)<br>\
as the camel does with his fore foot. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, (S,) فُلَانٌ يَخْبِطُ خَبْطَ عَشْوَآءَ (S, * TA)<br>\
(tropical:)  [Such a one goes at random, in a headstrong<br>\
and reckless manner,] like the weak-sighted she-camel that beats the ground with her fore feet<br>\
(تَخْبِطُ) as she goes along, not guarding herself<br>\
from anything. (S, TA.) It is a prov., applied<br>\
to him who turns away from a thing as though<br>\
he were not cognizant of it: or to him who is<br>\
continually falling into a thing. (Har p. 239.)<br>\
Zuheyr says,<br>\
رَأَيْتُ المَنَايَا خَبْطَ عَشْوَآءَ مَنْ تُصِبْ<br>\
تُمِتْهُ وَمَنْ تُخْطِئْ يُعَمَّرْ فَيَهْرَمِ<br>\
I saw the fates [treading mankind] like the treading of the weak-sighted she-camel; whom they<br>\
smote, him they killed: and whom they missed,<br>\
he was made to continue in life so that he lived to<br>\
extreme old age. (TA, and EM p. 132.) In like<br>\
manner you say, فُلَانٌ يَخْبِطُ فِى عَمْيَآءَ (tropical:)  Such a<br>\
one undertakes what he undertakes with ignorance.<br>\
(TA.) And خَبَطَ أَمْرَهُ عَلَى غَيْرِ بَصيرَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [He prosecuted his affair without mental perception, or<br>\
without certainty]. (S in art. عشو, q. v.) And<br>\
يَخْبِطُ فِى الظَّلَامِ (tropical:)  He goes in the night without a<br>\
lamp, and so becomes confounded and perplexed,<br>\
and unable to see his right course, and errs from<br>\
the way, and perchance may fall into a well.<br>\
(TA.) And خَبَطَ اللَّيْلَ, (K, TA,) aor. and inf. n.<br>\
as above, (TA,) (tropical:)  He went, or journeyed, in the<br>\
night without direction. (K, TA.) And بَاتَ<br>\
يَخْبِطُ الظَّلْمَآءَ (tropical:)  [He passed the night traversing the<br>\
darkness without direction]. (TA.) خَبْطٌ is said<br>\
to signify (assumed tropical:)  The act of journeying, or going, without direction: or upon what is not the middle,<br>\
or main part, of the road, or what is not the main<br>\
road. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence, perhaps,] خَبَطَهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  He asked of him a benefit, or favour, without<br>\
any tie of relationship; (K, * TA;) as also<br>\
↓ اختبطهُ: (IB, K:) or this is from خَبْطُ وَرَقِ الشَّجَرِ<br>\
[explained in what follows]: (Har p. 425:) or<br>\
the latter, [or both,] he came to him seeking his<br>\
beneficence without any such tie: (S:) or he came<br>\
to him seeking a gift; because he who does so<br>\
must beat the ground with his feet: (IF:) and<br>\
you also say, مَعْرُوفَهُ ↓ اختبط. (Aboo-Málik,<br>\
TA.) [The latter verb is the more common.<br>\
See also 10.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  He conferred a benefit<br>\
upon him without there having been any acquaintance between them, (S, K, TA,) and without<br>\
there being anything to draw them near, and<br>\
without there being any relationship: (TA:) and<br>\
خَبَطَهُ بِخَيْرِ signifies the same: (TA:) or he bestowed on him a benefit, (K, TA,) being asked:<br>\
(TA:) and you say also, بِخَيْرٍ ↓ اختبطهُ: (Aboo-Málik, TA:) and خَبَطَ فِيهِمْ بِخَيْرٍ signifies (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
benefited them. (TA.) &#39;Alkameh Ibn-&#39;Abadeh<br>\
says, (S, TA,) praising El-Hárith Ibn-AbeeShemir, (TA,)<br>\
وَفِى كُلِّ حَىٍّ قَدْ خَبَطْتَ بِنِعْمَةٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [And upon every tribe thou hast conferred benefit, app. meaning without being related to them]:<br>\
(S, TA:) but it is said in a marginal note to the<br>\
S, that خَبَطَّ would be better; and so it is accord.<br>\
to one relation: in the L, however, it is said that<br>\
خَبَتَّ would be more agreeable with analogy.<br>\
(TA.) Accord. to AZ, خَبَطْتُ الرَّجُلَ, inf. n. خَبْطٌ,<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  I held loving communion, commerce, or<br>\
intercourse, with the man. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [In respect<br>\
of the places which I have given to the abovementioned significations of asking and conferring<br>\
a benefit, I have followed the opinion of IF; but<br>\
it is said in the TA, and, I think, with greater<br>\
probability, that they are from what here next<br>\
follows.] ―<br>\
-b6-  خَبَطَ الوَرَقَ مِنَ الشَّجَرِ, aor.<br>\
خَبِطَ, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. خَبْطٌ, (Lth, T, Msb,) He made the leaves<br>\
to fall from the trees: (Msb:) or he beat the<br>\
leaves of the trees, (Lth, T,) meaning large trees<br>\
of the kind called طَلْح, [acacia, or mimosa, gummifera,] with a staff, or stick, (Lth,) so that they<br>\
fell off, or became scattered, (Lth, T,) after which<br>\
he gave them as food to camels; (Lth;) refrainfrom injuring thereby the trunks and branches<br>\
of the trees: (T:) and لَهُ خَبَطًا ↓ اختبط signifies<br>\
the same as خَبَطَ. (TA.) And خَبَطَ الشَّجَرَةَ, (S,<br>\
K,) aor. as above, (TA,) and so the inf. n., (S,)<br>\
He beat the tree with a staff, or stick, in order<br>\
that its leaves might fall off: (S:) or he bound<br>\
the tree, and then made its leaves to fall, (K, TA,)<br>\
by beating it with a staff, or stick, to give them<br>\
as food to camels and other beasts. (TA.) The<br>\
leaves are stored up for the camels; and in wintertime are bruised, or broken up, for them, and<br>\
moistened with water, and given to them as<br>\
fodder. (Har p. 218.) Mohammad was asked,<br>\
Does الغَبْط [i. e. “ the wishing for a blessing on<br>\
the condition that it shall not become transferred<br>\
from its possessor ”] injure [its author]? and he<br>\
answered, لَا إِلَّا كَمَا يَضُرُّ العِضَاهَ الخَبْطُ [No, save<br>\
as the beating off the leaves injures the trees called<br>\
&#39;idáh]; i. e., it only diminishes, without annulling,<br>\
its author&#39;s recompense, like the beating off the<br>\
leaves of the &#39;idáh, without cutting them down and<br>\
extirpating them; for the leaves will grow again.<br>\
(TA.) [See also art. غبط.] ―<br>\
-b7-  Hence, (A, TA,)<br>\
خَبَطَ القَوْمَ بِسَيْفِهِ (tropical:)  He struck the people with his<br>\
sword. (A, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  خَبَطَهُ الشَّيْطَانُ (tropical:)  The devil<br>\
touched him with a hurt, (K, TA,) so as to corrupt him, or disorder him, and render him insane;<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ تخبّطهُ: (K, TA:) or the latter,<br>\
[which is the more common,] the devil corrupted<br>\
him, or disordered him: (S, Mgh, Msb: *) lit.,<br>\
struck him: (Mgh, Msb:) or prostrated him,<br>\
and sported with him: or trampled upon him,<br>\
and prostrated him. (TA.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[ii. 276], ↓ لَا يَقُومُونَ إِلَّا كَمَا يَقُومُ الَّذِى يَتَخَبَّطُهُ<br>\
الشَّيْطَانُ مِنَ الْمَسِّ (tropical:)  [They shall not rise save as he<br>\
riseth whom the devil prostrateth by reason of<br>\
possession, or insanity]; i. e., as he who is affected by diabolical possession rises, in his state<br>\
of possession, when he is prostrated, and falls:<br>\
or it means, whom the devil corrupts, or disorders,<br>\
by rendering him insane. (K, * TA.) [You say<br>\
also, of a drug, العَقْلَ ↓ خبّط (assumed tropical:)  It disordered the<br>\
intellect: see the act. part. n., below.] ―<br>\
-b9-  خَبَطَ<br>\
also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He (a man) threw himself down<br>\
(S, L, K) where he was, (S, L,) to sleep, (S, K,)<br>\
or and slept. (L.) And (assumed tropical:)  He (a man) slept.<br>\
(A&#39; Obeyd, TA.) In the K, قَامَ is erroneously<br>\
put for نَامَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  خَبَطَ عَلَى البَابِ He knocked<br>\
upon the door, or at the door. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  خَبَطَ<br>\
العِرْقُ The vein beat, or pulsated. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
خَبَّطَ see 1, near the end of the paragraph.<br>\
5<br>\
تخبّط It was, or became, in a state of commotion, agitation, convulsion, tumult, or disturbance; syn. اِضْطَرَبَ. (Az, TA in art. حبط.)<br>\
-A2-  It is also trans.: see 1; second sentence, in<br>\
three places; and again, near the end of the paragraph, in two places.<br>\
8<br>\
إِخْتَبَطَ see 1, in six places. ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also, النَّاقَةُ<br>\
تَخْتَبِطُ الشَّوْكَ (assumed tropical:)  The she-camel eats the thorns.<br>\
(Th, TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استخبطهُ (assumed tropical:)  He asked of him a means of<br>\
access, nearness, intimacy, or ingratiation. (TA.)<br>\
خَبَطٌ What is beaten by beasts, (K, TA,) with<br>\
their feet, (TA,) and broken. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Leaves (Msb, K) of any kind (K) that have been<br>\
made to fall from a tree; (Msb, K;) by its being<br>\
beaten with a staff, or stick; (K, * TA;) used as<br>\
food for camels: (TA:) and leaves that have<br>\
been beaten off with staves, or sticks, then dried,<br>\
and ground, and mixed with flour or other substance, and beaten with the hand, and moistened<br>\
in a basin, with water, until they have become<br>\
viscous, or cohesive, when they are put into the<br>\
mouths of camels. (AHn, K.) The word is of the<br>\
measure فَعَلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ,<br>\
like many other instances that have been heard,<br>\
(Msb,) as نَفَضٌ and هَدَمٌ. (TA.)<br>\
خَبْطَةٌ (tropical:)  A touch, or stroke, of diabolical possession, or insanity. (TA.) You say also, بِفُلَانٍ<br>\
خَبْطَةٌ بِالمَسِّ (tropical:)  [In such a one is a touch of diabolical possession, or insanity]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
single act of a stallion-camel&#39;s covering of the<br>\
female. (TA.)<br>\

فَرَسٌ خَبُوطٌ and ↓ خَبِيطٌ A horse that strikes, or<br>\
beats, with his hind feet: (K:) or with his fore<br>\
feet. (T, TA.)<br>\

the camels, and so demolished: (K:) or a wateringtrough; so called because its clay is beaten with<br>\

خَبَّاطُ عَشَوَاتٍ (tropical:)  One who [frequently] goes in<br>\
the night without a lamp, and so becomes confounded and perplexed, and unable to see his<br>\
right course, and errs from the way, and perchance may fall into a well: occurring in a trad.<br>\
of &#39; Alee. (TA.)<br>\
خَابِطٌ Going, or journeying, without direction:<br>\
or one who beats the ground with his foot, and<br>\
knows not in what land he is going; either because of the darkness or because he is blind.<br>\
(Har p. 55.) You say, مَا أَدْرِى أَىُّ خَابِطِ لَيْلٍ هُوَ,<br>\
(S, TA,) and أَىُّ خَابِطِ اللَّيْلِ, (TA,) (tropical:)  I know not<br>\

-b2-  مَا لَهُ خَابِطٌ وَلَا نَاطِحٌ,<br>\
(tropical:)  He has not a camel nor a bull; meaning he has<br>\

ground, (TA,) with his feet: (K, TA:) by poetic<br>\
license written أَخْبَطُّ: (TA:) pl. خُبْطٌ. (K.)<br>\
مُخْبِطٌ Still; motionless; like مُخْبِتٌ: (TA in<br>\
art. خمد:) or i. q. مُطْرِقٌ [silent; not speaking:<br>\
or lowering his eyes, looking towards the ground].<br>\

another without there being anything to draw him<br>\

is explained in one place as signifying (tropical:)  One<br>\
who seeks a gift without any previous acquaintance.])<br>\
