خَسِرَ, (S, A, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
خَسَرَ; (K;)<br>\
and خَسَرَ, aor.<br>\
خَسِرَ; (K;) but the latter is an unusual form [except in the sense of أَخْسَرَ]; (B,<br>\
TA;) inf. n. خُسْرَانٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and خُسْرٌ<br>\
(S, Msb, K) and خَسَارَةٌ (Msb, K) [which are the<br>\
only forms assigned in the TA to the verb when<br>\
used with reference to traffic] and خُسُرٌ and خَسْرٌ<br>\
and خَسَرٌ and خَسَارٌ; (K;) He lost, or suffered<br>\
loss or diminution: or he was deceived, cheated,<br>\
beguiled, or circumvented: (K:) فِى البَيْعِ in<br>\
selling; (S;) or فِى بَيَعِهِ in his selling; (A;) or<br>\
فِى تِجَارَتِهِ in his traffic: (Msb, K: [see also 4:])<br>\
the former is the original signification: (TA:)<br>\
he suffered diminution of his capital; he lost part<br>\
thereof: (B, TA:) and he lost his capital altogether. (Bd in iv. 118; &amp;c.) خُسْرَانٌ is also<br>\
attributed to an action, as well as to a man: (B,<br>\
TA:) you say, (but in this case the verb is used<br>\
tropically, A,) خَسِرَتْ تِجَارَتُهُ (tropical:)  [His traffic was<br>\
losing; or an occasion of loss]; (A, B;) opposed<br>\
to رَبِحَتْ. (A.) It is also used in relation to<br>\
personal acquisitions; such as health, and safety,<br>\
and intellect, and faith, and the recompense or<br>\
reward of obedience [to God], which God has<br>\
declared [Kur xxii. 11 and xxxix. 17] to be manifest خُسْرَان, (B,) since there is none like it. (Bd.)<br>\
For instance, you say, خَسِرَ عَقْلَهُ, and مَالَهُ, He<br>\
lost his intellect, and his property. (IAar.) [In<br>\
a phrase of this kind, the noun which immediately<br>\
follows the verb may be considered as put in the<br>\
accus. case on account of the rejection of a prep.,<br>\
namely فِى: for] it is said that خَسِرَ is never<br>\
used otherwise than intransitively: though this<br>\
has been contradicted, on the ground of the following phrase in the Kur [xxii. 11], خَسِرَ الدُّنْيَا<br>\
وَ الْآخِرَةَ [He hath lost, or he loseth, the things of<br>\
the present life and of the latter life]; and the<br>\
like; as الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَ أَهْلِيهِمْ [Who shall<br>\
have lost themselves, or their own souls, and their<br>\
families, or their wives; Kur xxxix. 17 and<br>\
xlii. 44]; (MF, TA;) i. e., themselves, or their<br>\
own souls, by their having erred, and their families by their having caused them to err, or by<br>\
being separated from them for ever; (Bd;) or<br>\
by being themselves made to remain for ever in<br>\
Hell, and by their not gaining access to the حُور<br>\
prepared in Paradise [as wives] for the believers:<br>\
(Jel:) or the meaning is, accord. to Fr, who shall<br>\
be deceived of their own souls, &amp;c.: or, accord. to<br>\
others, who shall have destroyed their own souls,<br>\
&amp;c. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also [He experienced, or saw, that<br>\
he was loser; or] his having lost became manifest to him: so in the Kur xl. [78 and] last verse.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (with all the forms of the inf. n.<br>\
above mentioned, K,) He erred; went astray;<br>\
deviated from, or lost, or missed, the right way:<br>\
or he became lost; he perished; or he died: syn.<br>\
ضَلَّ, (K,) and هَلَكَ. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  خَسَرَهُ, (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
IAar, Zj, S, A, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
خَسِرَ (Zj, Msb) and<br>\
خَسُرَ, (Bd<br>\
in lv. 8,) inf. n. خَسْرٌ (Msb, K) and خُسْرَانٌ; (K;)<br>\
and ↓ اخسرهُ, (A &#39;Obeyd, Zj, S, A, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
إِخْسَارٌ; (Msb, K;) and ↓ خسّرهُ; (A;) He made<br>\
it defective, or deficient; (A &#39;Obeyd, IAar, Zj, S,<br>\
A, Msb, K;) namely, the weight, and the measure; (Zj, TA;) and the thing weighed; (TA;)<br>\
and the balance, (A &#39;Obeyd, IAar, Zj, A, Msb,)<br>\
by diminishing the weight. (Msb.) ↓ The second<br>\
of these forms is more common, in this sense, than<br>\
the first (Zj, TA) [and than the third]. For<br>\
الْمِيزَانَ ↓ وَ لَا تُخْسِرُوا, in the Kur lv. 8, there are<br>\
three other readings; namely تَخْسُرُوا and تَخْسُروا<br>\
and تَخْسَرُوا; in the last of which, the prep. فِى<br>\
is omitted after the verb. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And He, or<br>\
it, made him to lose, or suffer loss; to err, or go<br>\
astray; to become lost, or to perish.]<br>\
2<br>\
خسّرهُ, (A, K,) inf. n. تَخْسِيرٌ, (S, K,) i. q.<br>\
خَسَرَهُ, q. v.: (A:) [and particularly] He, or it,<br>\
destroyed him; caused him to perish. (S, K.)<br>\
You say, خسّرهُ سُوْءُ عَمَلِهِ (tropical:)  The evilness of his conduct caused him to perish. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He put him<br>\
away, or far away; removed, alienated, or<br>\
estranged, him; (IAar, Msb;) from good, or<br>\
prosperity. (IAar.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He attributed, or imputed, to him خُسْرَان [i. e. loss; or error, or<br>\
deviation from the right way]: like كَذَّبَهُ meaning “ he attributed, or imputed, to him lying,”<br>\
&amp;c. (Msb.)<br>\
4<br>\
اخسرهُ i. q. خَسَرَهُ, which see in three places:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, Zj, S, A, Msb:) [and particularly]<br>\
He made him to lose, or suffer loss, in his traffic;<br>\
contr. of أَرْبَحَهُ. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  And اخسر He fell into<br>\
loss; (A;) he met with loss in his traffic. (TA.<br>\
[See also 1.])<br>\
خُسْرٌ an inf. n. of خَسِرَ. (S, Msb, K.) In the<br>\
Kur ciii. 2, accord. to some, it means Punishment<br>\
for sin. (TA.)<br>\
خَسِرٌ: see خَاسِرٌ.<br>\
خُسْرَانٌ an inf. n. of خَسِرَ. (S, A, Msb, K.)<br>\
[For particular usages thereof, see 1. As a simple<br>\
subst., it generally signifies Loss, or the state of<br>\
suffering loss or diminution: the state of being<br>\
deceived or cheated: error, or deviation from the<br>\
right way: (see also خَسَارٌ:) or the state of becoming lost, of perishing, or of dying.] ―<br>\
-b2-  It is<br>\
also an inf. n. of خَسَرَهُ. (K.)<br>\
خُسْرَوِىٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\
خُسْرَوَانِىٌّ, (A, K,) or خُسْرُوَانِىٌّ, (TA, [but the<br>\
former is the better known,]) A certain kind of<br>\
garment or cloth; (A, K;) so called in relation<br>\
to Khusrow Sháh, one of the [kings of Persia<br>\
called] أَكَاسِرَة [pl. of كِسْرَى or كَسْرَى]; as also<br>\
↓ خُسْرَوِىٌّ. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A certain wine or<br>\
beverage. (K.)<br>\
خَسَارٌ and ↓ خَسَارَةٌ, [both inf. ns. of خَسِرَ, q. v.,]<br>\
(S,) and ↓ خَيْسَرَى, (S, M, K, in some copies of<br>\
the K written خَنْسَرَى, with ن, TA,) Error; or<br>\
deviation from the right way: [like خُسْرَانٌ:]<br>\
(S:) and perdition; or death; (S, K;) as also<br>\

of a pl. form, but] has no sing. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And all<br>\
the foregoing words, including ↓ خناسير, Baseness,<br>\
ignobleness, ungenerousness, or meanness; (K;)<br>\
the last, in poetry, shortened to ↓ خَنَاسِرُ: (TA:)<br>\
and ↓ خَيْسَرَى, (K,) and, as some say, ↓ خَنَاسِيرُ,<br>\
(TA,) perfidy, unfaithfulness, or treachery. (K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
خَسِيرٌ: see خَاسِرٌ.<br>\
خَسَارَةٌ: see خَسَارٌ.<br>\
خَاسِرٌ Losing, or suffering loss, in his traffic.<br>\
(Lth.) And [hence,] تِجَارَةٌ خَاسِرَةٌ (tropical:)  [Losing traffic;<br>\
traffic which is an occasion of loss]; opposed to<br>\
رَابِحَةٌ. (A.) And صَفْقَةٌ خَاسِرَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A bargain that<br>\
does not bring gain [but on the contrary occasions<br>\
loss]. (TA.) And كَرَّةٌ خَاسِرَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  An unprofitable<br>\

-b3-  Erring;<br>\
going astray; deviating from, or losing, or missing, the right way: or becoming lost; perishing;<br>\
or dying: syn. ضَالٌّ: (K:) and so ↓ خَسِرٌ (TA)<br>\
and ↓ خَسِيرٌ and ↓ خَيْسَرَى, (K, TA, but the last<br>\
written in the CK خَيْسَرِىٌّ,) or ↓ خَيْسَرٌ, for it is<br>\
said to occur [as an epithet] only in the following<br>\
saying, in which خَيْسَرَى is said to be put for<br>\
خَيْسَرٌ to assimilate it to preceding words: بِفِيهِ<br>\
البَرَى وَ حُمَّى خَيْبَرَى وَ شَرٌّ مَا يَرَى فَإِنَّهُ خَيْسَرَى [In<br>\
his mouth be dust, and may the fever of Kheyber<br>\
befall him, and evil be that which he shall see,<br>\
for he is one who goeth astray: but in the TA,<br>\
in art. ورى, is another reading; for بفيه البرى,<br>\
substituting بِهِ الوَرَى, meaning a certain disease].<br>\
(TA.) [Hence,] أَحْمَقُ خَاسِرٌ دَابِرٌ دَامِرٌ [Foolish,<br>\
or stupid, erring, and utterly perishing]. (T in<br>\
art. بت. [See بَاتٌّ: and see also دَامِرٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also<br>\

خنسر.) ―<br>\

weakness; (TA in art. خنسر;) [as though meaning the people of cowardice (الجَبَانَة): or it may<br>\
mean the people of the burial-ground (الجَبَّانَة);<br>\
for, accord. to AHát, ↓ الخناسير signifies those<br>\
who conduct [to the burial-ground] the corpse or<br>\
the bier with the corpse; perhaps from خَنَاسِرُ<br>\
meaning “ small, or little, and weak men. ” (TA.)<br>\

خِنْسَر,]) or ↓ خِنْسِيرٌ, (Ibn-&#39;Osfoor, AHei, and K<br>\

خنسر, and the latter likewise accord. to the TA<br>\
in the present art.,) A calamity, or misfortune:<br>\
(K, TA:) pl. [of the latter] in this sense خَنَاسِيرُ,<br>\
