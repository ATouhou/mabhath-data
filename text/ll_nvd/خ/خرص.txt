خَرَصَ النَّخْلَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb,) aor.<br>\
خَرُصَ (A,<br>\
Msb) [and<br>\
خَرِصَ, as appears from what follows,]<br>\
inf. n. خَرْصٌ, (S, A Mgh, Msb,) [and خِرْصٌ is<br>\
also allowable, (see what follows,)] He computed<br>\
by conjecture the quantity of the fruit upon the<br>\
palm-trees: (A, Mgh, Msb:) or he computed by<br>\
conjecture the quantity that was upon the palmtrees of fresh ripe dates that would be dried dates.<br>\
(S.) خَرْصٌ signifies The computing quantity by<br>\
conjecture; (A, K, TA;) conjecturing; opining:<br>\
or forming an opinion of a thing of which one is<br>\
not certain: you say, خَرَصَ العَدَدَ, aor.<br>\
خَرُصَ and<br>\
خَرِصَ,<br>\
inf. n. خَرْصٌ and خِرْصٌ, the latter said by ISh to<br>\
be like عِلْمٌ as inf. n. of عَلِمَ, and said by Az to<br>\
be allowable because a simple subst. is put in the<br>\
place of an inf. n., He computed by conjecture the<br>\
number: and hence خَرْصُ النَّخْلِ, and التَّمْرِ, [the<br>\
computing by conjecture the quantity of fruit<br>\
upon palm-trees, and of dates,] because خَرْصٌ is<br>\
the computing quantity by opinion, not by knowledge. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  خَرْصٌ also signifies Any speaking by opinion, or conjecture. (K, * TA.) You<br>\
say, خَرَصَ فِيهِ He spoke of him, or it, by opinion,<br>\

-b3-  And hence, (TA,) خَرَصَ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
خَرُصَ, (S,) inf. n. خَرْصٌ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) (tropical:)  He lied; spoke falsely; said what was<br>\

You say also, عَلَيْهِ ↓ (tropical:)  تخرّص (tropical:)  He forged a lie<br>\
against him. (A, K, TA.) And ↓ قَالَ ذٰلِكَ تَخَرُّصًا<br>\
(tropical:)  [He said that forging a lie]. (A.) And ↓ اخترص<br>\
القَوْلَ, (A, K, *) and ↓ تخرِّصهُ, (A,) (tropical:)  He forged<br>\

-A2-  خَرِصَ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
خَرَصَ,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. خَرَصٌ, (S, A,) He (a man) was<br>\
hungry and cold: (S, A: *) or hungry in cold.<br>\
(K.) Being hungry without being cold is not<br>\
termed خَرَصٌ: but being cold without being<br>\
hungry is termed خَصَرٌ. (S.)<br>\

[Hence,] مَا تَمْلِكُ فُلَانَةُ خُرْصًا, meaning (tropical:)  Such a<br>\
woman has not in her possession anything. (A.)<br>\
خِرْصٌ a subst. from خَرَصَ as explained above;<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K) Conjectural computation of<br>\
quantity: (ISh:) or quantity computed by conjecture of the fruit upon palm-trees. (A, Mgh.)<br>\
You say, كَمْ خِرْصُ نَخْلِكَ [What is the conjectural computation of the quantity, or the quantity<br>\
computed by conjecture, of the produce of thy<br>\
palm-trees?]. (TA.) And كَمْ خِرْصُ أَرْضِكَ [What<br>\
is the conjectural computation, or the quantity<br>\
computed by conjecture, of the produce of the<br>\

↓ خَرَّاصٌ. (S, A, Msb, TA.) قُتِلَ الخَرَّاصُونَ, in<br>\
