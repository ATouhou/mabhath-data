خَدَعَهُ, (TA,) [aor.<br>\
خَدَعَ,] inf. n. خَدْعٌ, (Bd in<br>\
ii. 8,) He hid it, or concealed it; (TA;) as also<br>\
↓ اخدعه, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. إِخْدَاعٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[And hence, app.,] (Lh, K,) inf. n. as above,<br>\
(Lh,) (tropical:)  He doubled it, or folded it, one part upon<br>\
another; namely, a garment, or piece of cloth.<br>\
(Lh, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence, also, accord. to<br>\
some,] خَدَعَهُ, aor.<br>\
خَدَعَ, inf. n. خَدْعٌ (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K) and خِدْعٌ, (AZ, S, K,) or the latter is a simple<br>\
subst., (Msb, TA,) and خَدِيعَةٌ, (TA,) or this<br>\
[also] is a simple subst., (Msb, TA,) like خِدَاعٌ,<br>\
[which is also an inf. n. of 3,] and like خُدٌعَةٌ, (TA,)<br>\
He deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or<br>\
outwitted, him; syn. خَتَلَهُ; (S, Mgh, K;) and<br>\
desired to do to him a foul, an abominable, or an<br>\
evil, action, without his knowing whence it proceeded: (S, K:) or he dissembled [or acted deceitfully] with him; pretended to him the contrary of what he concealed: (TA:) or he made<br>\
him to resign, or relinquish, the object that he had<br>\
in view, by pretending to him something the contrary of what he concealed: (Er-Rághib, B:)<br>\
and ↓ خادعهُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. مُخَادَعَةٌ (S) [and<br>\
خِدَاعٌ], signifies the same; (S, * TA;) as also<br>\
↓ اختدعهُ; and ↓ تخدّعهُ; and ↓ خدّعهُ, inf. n.<br>\
تَخْدِيعٌ: (TA:) or this last signifies he deceived<br>\
him, deluded him, beguiled him, circumvented<br>\
him, or outwitted him, much: (KL:) [and of<br>\
another of these verbs we find the following various explanations:] ↓ خادعهُ is syn. with كَايَدَهُ<br>\
[which has the first of the meanings assigned<br>\
in this sentence to خَدَعَهُ; or signifies he practised<br>\
with him mutual deceit, delusion, guile, or circumvention; he deceived him, &amp;c., being deceived,<br>\
&amp;c., by him; and this latter meaning, if not each<br>\
meaning, may be intended here by كايده; for<br>\
Bd says, (in ii. 8,) that مُخَادَعَة is between two]:<br>\
(TA:) or it signifies he strove, endeavoured, or<br>\
desired, to deceive, delude, beguile, circumvent,<br>\
or outwit, him; (AAF, L;) [agreeably with<br>\
what is said by Kemál Páshá Zádeh, (as I find<br>\
in a marginal note in a copy of the MS, and also<br>\
in the Kull p. 178,) that one says of a man<br>\
خادع when he has not attained his desire, and<br>\
خَدَعَ when he has attained his desire;] for many<br>\
a verb of the measure فَاعَلَ relates to one only;<br>\
as in the instances of عَاقَبْتُ اللِّصَّ and طَارَقْتُ<br>\
النَّعْلَ: (L:) or it signifies, [like خَدَعَهُ,] he pretended to him something different from that which<br>\
was in his mind. (K.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[ii. 8], اللّٰهَ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ↓ يُخَادِعُونَ, (TA,) meaning They pretend, to God and to those who have<br>\
believed, something different from that which is<br>\
in their minds, by concealing unbelief and pretending belief; for when they do thus to the<br>\
believers, they do thus to God: (K:) and again,<br>\
[in iv. 141], اللّٰهَ وَهُوَ خَادِعُهُمْ ↓ يُخَادِعُونَ [They<br>\
strive, endeavour, or desire, to deceive God, or]<br>\
they think that they deceive God, but He is [their<br>\
deceiver, i. e.,] the requiter, to them, of their<br>\
خِدَاع [or deceit, &amp;c.]: (TA:) or the meaning is<br>\
[they deceive] the friends of God: (S:) and<br>\
[agreeably with this last rendering, and that given<br>\
in the K,] Aboo-Hayáh reads, in the former passage, يَخْدَعُونَ اللّٰهَ: (TA:) [which passage continues thus:] إِلَّا أَنْفُسَهُمْ ↓ وَمَا يُخَادِعُونَ [but they<br>\
do not deceive any save themselves]; i. e., the re-<br>\
sult of their خِدَاع [or deceit] does not befall any<br>\
save themselves: (K:) here, again, Aboo-Hayáh<br>\
reads يَخْدَعُونَ: (TA:) Muärrik reads وَمَا<br>\
↓ يَخَدِّعُونَ, meaning يَخْتَدِعُونَ. (K.) Accord.<br>\
to IAar, الخَدْعُ signifies مَنْعُ الحَقِّ [meaning The<br>\
preventing from discovering, or accepting, the<br>\
truth]. (L.) [“ He deceived him,” or the like,<br>\
seems to be generally regarded as the primary<br>\
signification of خَدَعَهُ, for it occupies the first<br>\
place in all the lexicons to which I have access:<br>\
but Bd says (in ii. 8) that this meaning is from<br>\
خَدَعَ said of the ضَبِّ, and that the primary signification of خَدْعٌ is the act of “ concealing: ”<br>\
the action of the ضبّ, however, as will appear in<br>\
what follows, implies, and originates from, a<br>\
desire of deceit; and so, often, does the act of<br>\
concealing.] ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence, app.,] خَدَعْتُهُ I gained<br>\
the mastery over him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  خَدَعَ, (Lth, TA,<br>\
&amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
خَدَعَ, inf. n. خَدْعٌ, (TA,) said of a [lizard<br>\
of the kind called] ضَبّ, [as though meaning<br>\
either خَدَعَ المُحْتَرِشَ It deceived the hunter, or<br>\
خَدَعَ نَفْسَهُ it concealed itself,] signifies it entered<br>\
into its hole; (Lth;) as also خَدَعَ فِى حُجْرِهِ:<br>\
(S, K:) or it scented a man, and therefore entered its hole, in order that it might not be caught;<br>\
as also ↓ انخدع: (TA:) or it entered into its<br>\
hole in a tortuous manner: and in like manner,<br>\
a gazelle into its covert: but mostly said of a<br>\
ضبّ: (Abu-l-&#39;Omeythil:) also said of other<br>\
things: (Lth:) of a fox, meaning he took to<br>\
going to the right and left, deceitfully, or guilefully: and of a man, meaning he hid himself<br>\
from another: and he assumed a disposition not<br>\
his own. (TA.) [See also خِدَاعٌ, below.] ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
Hence, i. e. from خَدَعَ said of the ضبّ, (A, TA,)<br>\
خَدَعَتْ عَيْنُ الشَّمْسِ (tropical:)  The disc of the sun set; (A,<br>\
K, TA;) like خَضَعَتْ. (TA in art. خضع.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
[And] خَدَعَتْ عَيْنُهُ (tropical:)  His eye sank, or became<br>\
depressed, in his head. (Lh, K, TA.) [Also<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  His eye did not sleep: for] خَدَعَتِ<br>\
العَيْنُ signifies (assumed tropical:)  the eye did not sleep. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
[Hence also, as indicated in the S,] مَا خَدَعَتْ<br>\
فِى عَيْنِى نَعْسَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [A slumber did not enter my<br>\
eye]: (S:) or مَا خَدَعَتْ بِعَيْنِهِ نَعْسَةٌ, (so in the<br>\
L,) or خَدْعَةٌ, i. e. نَعْسَةٌ, (so in the TA,) meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  a slumber did not pass by his eye. (L, TA.)<br>\
[And from the same source have originated<br>\
several other tropical significations, of which exs.<br>\
here follow.] ―<br>\
-b9-  خَدَعَتِ الأُمُورِ (tropical:)  The affairs varied in their state; or were, or became, variable.<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.) ―<br>\
-b10-  خَدَعَتِ السُّوقُ, (S, K,) inf. n.<br>\
خَدْعٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  [The market varied in its state;<br>\
at one time being brisk, and at another time dull,<br>\
in respect of traffic: (see خَادِعٌ, below:) or] the<br>\
market became dull in respect of traffic; (S, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ انخدعت; (Lh, TA;) or انخدع: (K:<br>\
[but سوق is generally fem.:]) and, as some say,<br>\
it became brisk in respect of traffic: thus it appears to have two contr. significations: (TA:)<br>\
and خَدَعَ السِّعْرُ (tropical:)  The price became high, or dear.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  Said of a man, خَدَعَ also signifies (tropical:)  His<br>\
wealth, (K, TA,) and the like, (TA,) became<br>\
small in amount, or little. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b12-  Said of<br>\
a time, inf. n. خَدْعٌ, (tropical:)  Its rain became little:<br>\
(TA:) and of rain, (tropical:)  It became little. (K, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b13-  Said of spittle, or saliva, (tropical:)  It dried: (S, K,<br>\
TA:) or it became little, and dried, in the mouth:<br>\
(A, TA.) or it became deficient; and when it<br>\
becomes deficient, it becomes thick; and when it<br>\
becomes thick, it becomes stinking: (TA:) or<br>\
it became corrupt: (IAar, TA:) and in like<br>\
manner, said of a thing, it became corrupt, or<br>\
bad. (TA.) [See also خَادِعٌ, below.] ―<br>\
-b14-  Said of<br>\
a generous man, (K,) (tropical:)  He refrained [from<br>\
giving], (S, L, K,) and refused. (L.) You say,<br>\
كَانَ فُلَانٌ يُعْطِى ثُمَّ خَدَعَ (tropical:)  [Such a one used to<br>\
give; then he refrained, and refused]. (S.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
خَدَعَهُ aor.<br>\
خَدَعَ, inf. n. خَدْعٌ, He cut, or severed,<br>\
his [vein called the] أَخْدَع. (TA.)<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  خُدِّعَ He was deceived, deluded, beguiled,<br>\
circumvented, or outwitted, repeatedly, so that he<br>\
became experienced: or he was deceived, &amp;c., in<br>\
war, time after time, so that he became skilful:<br>\
or he became experienced in affairs: or he became<br>\
experienced in affairs, sound in judgment, cunning, and guileful. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
خادعهُ, inf. n. مُخَادَعَةٌ and خِدَاعٌ: see 1, in<br>\
five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  مُخَادَعَةٌ العَيْنِ means The causing<br>\
the eye to doubt respecting that which it sees.<br>\
(Ham p. 541.) ―<br>\
-b3-  خادع المَجْدَ, (As, K, *) or<br>\
الحَمْدَ, (AA,) a phrase used by Er-Rá&#39;ee, (TA,)<br>\
He forsook, or relinquished, (As, AA, K,) glory,<br>\

4<br>\
اخدعهُ: see 1, first signification.<br>\
-A2-  He incited him to deceive, delude, beguile, circumvent,<br>\
or outwit; or to desire to do to another a foul,<br>\
an abominable, or an evil, action, without the<br>\
latter&#39;s knowing whence it proceeded; or to pretend to another something different from that<br>\
which was in his mind. (K.) In the Kur ii. 8,<br>\
quoted above, Yahyà Ibn-Yaamar reads, وَمَا<br>\
يُخْدِعُونَ. (TA.)<br>\

خَدِعٌ: see خَادِعٌ, in two places.<br>\
خَدْعَةٌ A single act of deceit, delusion, guile,<br>\
circumvention, or outwitting. (Mgh.) It is said<br>\
in a trad., (Mgh, TA,) الحَرْبُ خَدْعَةٌ, and ↓ خُدْعَةٌ,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and ↓ خِدْعَةٌ, (K,) and ↓ خُدَعَةٌ,<br>\
(AZ, Ks, S, Mgh, K,) accord. to different relaters;<br>\
(Th, Mgh, K;) the first being the most chaste,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb,) said to be the form used by Mo-<br>\
hammad; (Th, Mgh, Msb;) the second ascribed<br>\
by El-Khattábee to the vulgar; (TA;) the last<br>\
the best in point of meaning: (Mgh:) i. e., accord. to the first reading, (Mgh,) War is finished<br>\
by a single act of deceit, &amp;c.; (Mgh, O, K;)<br>\
accord. to the second, war is a thing by which<br>\
one is deceived; (Mgh, Msb;) or war is deceived;<br>\
for when one of the two parties deceives the<br>\
other, it is as though the war itself were deceived;<br>\
(IAth, TA;) [accord. to the third, war is a mode,<br>\
or manner, of deceiving;] and accord. to the<br>\
fourth, war is a deceiver of those engaged in it<br>\
(IAth, Mgh, TA) by the frequent deceits which<br>\
occur therein. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  (tropical:)  A slumber. (TA.)<br>\
خُدْعَةٌ A thing by which, or with which, one<br>\

thing with which one plays. ” (Msb.) See خَدْعَةٌ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  One whom people deceive, delude, beguile, circumvent, or outwit, (S, K,) much; (K;) like<br>\
as لُعْنَةٌ signifies one “ who is much cursed. ”<br>\
(TA.) [See, again, خَدْعَةٌ. The comparison of<br>\
خُدْعَةٌ in one sense with لُعْبَةٌ, and in another<br>\
sense with لُعْنَةٌ, suggests that one of the explanations above may perhaps be founded upon a<br>\
mistranscription. On فُعْلَةٌ as the measure of a<br>\
word having the sense of a pass. part. n., see a<br>\
remark of IB voce لَقَطٌ.] ―<br>\

hunted by a man feeling the head of its hole in<br>\
order that it may imagine him to be a serpent:<br>\
if the ضب be experienced, it puts forth its tail to<br>\
half the length of the hole, and if it feel a serpent,<br>\
it strikes it, and cuts it in halves; and if it be a<br>\
hunter, it does not suffer him to lay hold upon its<br>\
tail, and so it escapes, for the hunter does not<br>\
dare to put his hand into its hole, because it may<br>\
not be free from a scorpion, of which he fears the<br>\
sting, as a strong friendship subsists between the<br>\
ضب and the scorpion, and the former makes use<br>\
of the latter to defend itself from the hunter:<br>\
or, as some say, it signifies its concealing itself,<br>\
and remaining long in its hole, and seldom appearing, and being very cautious. (O, TA.)<br>\
خَدُوعٌ: see خَادِعٌ, in three places. ―<br>\

S, K;) and ↓ خُدْعَةٌ; (TA;) and ↓ خِدَاعٌ; (TA;)<br>\
which [is also an inf. n. of خَادَعَهُ, and] originally<br>\
signifies concealment: (Ham p. 541:) [and hence<br>\
as above: and] also signifies prevention (مَنْعٌ);<br>\
and art, artifice, cunning, or skill, in the management of affairs; (IAar, Sgh, K;) or a making<br>\
another to resign, or relinquish, the object that<br>\
he has in view, by pretending to him something<br>\
the contrary of what he conceals. (Er-Rághib, B.)<br>\
خَدَّاعٌ; and its fem, with ة: see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
خَادِعٌ [Deceiving, deluding, beguiling, circumventing, outwitting, or the like;] act. part. n.<br>\

-b3-  And دَهْرٌ خَادِعٌ and ↓ خُدَعَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Deceiving, or<br>\
varying, and very deceitful, or very variable,<br>\
fortune, or time]. (TA.) [Whence, or] because<br>\
of its variableness, (TA,) ↓ الخُدَعَةُ is (tropical:)  a name<br>\

or a market in which one cannot obtain a thing<br>\
because of its dearness. (TA.) خَادِعٌ also signifies (tropical:)  Anything unsaleable, or difficult of sale,<br>\

Fr, the Benoo-Asad use the epithet ↓ مُخَادِعُ<br>\
[perhaps a mistake for خَادِعٌ] in the sense of<br>\
(tropical:)  High, or dear, applied to a price. (TA.) ―<br>\

-b2-<br>\
Also A person in whose love, or affection, no<br>\
confidence is placed. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And hence, (TA,)<br>\

TA;) accord. to some. (S.) You say, غَرَّهُمُ الخَيْدَعُ<br>\
(tropical:)  The mirage deceived them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [For the<br>\
same reason,] it is also applied to (assumed tropical:)  The cat. (IB.)<br>\

is derived the phrase (TA) غُولٌ خَيْدَعٌ (S, K,<br>\
