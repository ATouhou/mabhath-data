[i. e. light, both properly and tropically: the tropical significations are shown by the preceding<br>\
paragraph, and by explanations of خَفِيفٌ; and<br>\
some by what here follows]: (Msb:) تَخْفِيفٌ is<br>\
the contr. of تَثْقِيلٌ. (S, K.) ―<br>\

تَثْقِيلٌ and تَشْدِيدٌ: and by making a movent consonant quiescent; opposed to تَثْقِيلٌ and تَحْرِيكٌ:<br>\
each of these changes in a word is said to be<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  it was, or became, narrow in its circumstances, or<br>\

him, to lightness, levity, or unsteadiness, so as to<br>\
induce him to follow him in his error: (TA:)<br>\
[and simply] (tropical:)  he excited him to lightness, levity,<br>\
or unsteadiness; (Ksh and Bd and Jel in the<br>\

so that he became unsteady; said of impatience;<br>\

that is worn (JK, S, Msb, K, TA) upon the<br>\
foot: (TA:) pl. خِفَافٌ (S, L, Msb, K) and أَخْفَافٌ<br>\
[which is a pl. of pauc.]. (L, TA.) Hence, رَجَعَ<br>\
بِخُفَّىْ حُنَيْنٍ [He returned with the two boots<br>\
of Honeyn]; a saying which originated thus:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, TA:) an Arab of the desert bargained with Honeyn the إِسْكَاف [or maker of<br>\
shoes and boots], (K,) who was of the people of<br>\
El-Heereh, (TA,) for a pair of boots, until he<br>\
angered him, (K,) and Honeyn desired to anger<br>\
the Arab: (TA:) so when the Arab of the desert<br>\
departed, Honeyn took one of his two boots and<br>\
threw it down in the way, and then he threw<br>\
down the other in another place; and when the<br>\
Arab passed by one of them, he said, “How<br>\
like is this to the boot of Honeyn ! and if the<br>\
other were with it, I would take it: ” and he<br>\
went on: and when he came to the other, he<br>\
repented of having left the former: and Honeyn<br>\
had lain in wait for him: therefore when the<br>\
Arab went away in search of the former [boot],<br>\
Honeyn betook himself to the camel that he rode,<br>\
and what was upon it, and went away therewith;<br>\
and the Arab came, having with him nothing<br>\
but a pair of boots; and it was said, (K,) i. e. his<br>\
people said to him, (TA,) “ What hast thou<br>\
brought from thy journey? ” and he answered,<br>\
جِئْتُكُمْ بِخُفَّىْ حُنَيْنٍ [“ I have brought you the<br>\
two boots of Honeyn ”]: and this became a<br>\
prov., applied on the occasion of one&#39;s despairing<br>\
of an object of want, and returning disappointed:<br>\
(K:) thus the case is related by A &#39;Obeyd, and<br>\
by most others after him. (TA.) Accord. to ISk,<br>\
Honeyn was a strong man, who asserted his relationship to Asad Ibn-Háshim Ibn-&#39;Abd-Menáf,<br>\
and came to &#39;Abd-El-Muttalib, wearing a pair of<br>\
red boots, [formerly distinctive of kings and men<br>\
of high rank,] and said, “O my paternal uncle,<br>\
I am the son of Asad the son of Háshim the son<br>\
of &#39;Abd-Menáf: ” but &#39;Abd-El-Muttalib said,<br>\
“ No, by the garments of my father Háshim, I<br>\
know not in thee the natural qualities of Háshim;<br>\
therefore return thou: ” so he returned: and it<br>\
was said, رَجَعَ حُنَيْنٌ بِخُفَّيْهِ [Honeyn returned<br>\
with his pair of boots]. (O, K, &amp;c.) As to the<br>\
saying of the rájiz,<br>\
يَحْمِلُ فِى سَحْقٍ مِنَ الخِفَافِ<br>\
تَوَادِيًا سُوِّينَ مِنْ خِلَافِ<br>\
he means thereby [He carries, in] a pastor&#39;s bag<br>\
(كِنْف) made of the leg of a خُفّ [or boot, wooden<br>\

made of different trees]. (S. See خِلَافٌ.) ―<br>\

the horse: (TA:) and sometimes of the ostrich,<br>\
(K,) because resembling that of the camel:<br>\

fem.: (TA:) pl. أَخْفَافٌ. (S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\

hence, by a synecdoche, for ذَوَاتُ خُفٍّ,] (tropical:)  Camels;<br>\
coupled with حَافِرٌ as meaning horses, [and sometimes asses or mules], (Mgh, TA, *) and ظِلْفٌ<br>\

ظِلْفٌ (tropical:)  [meaning He possesses not camels, nor<br>\
horses or asses or mules, nor sheep or goats or<br>\

came following one another, the head of each<br>\
[except the first] being at the tail of the next<br>\

-b4-  An aged camel: (K:) [and a weak<br>\
camel:] or, as some say, a bulky camel: pl.<br>\

اراك, what the aged and weak of camels cannot<br>\
reach may be prohibited]: i. e. what is near,<br>\
thereof, to the place of pasturage is not to be prohibited, but is to be left for the aged and weak<br>\
camels, that cannot go far in search of pasture:<br>\
(As, O, Msb:) or what camels cannot reach (Msb,<br>\
TA) by means of their اخفاف, (Msb,) by walking<br>\
thereto, (TA,) may be prohibited: (Msb, TA:)<br>\

say, خَرَجَ فُلَانٌ فِى خِفٍّ مِنْ أَصْحَابِهِ Such a one<br>\
went forth among a company consisting of few<br>\
persons of his companions. (S.)<br>\
خِفَّةٌ an inf. n. of 1 [in almost all of its senses,<br>\

sense] (JK, * S, * Msb, K, * TA) and ↓ خُفَافٌ: (S, *<br>\
K, * TA:) the first is applied to a thing; as also<br>\
↓ the second, (Msb,) which signifies anything<br>\

الرُّوحِ, the same; or clever, or ingenious: the pl.<br>\
of the first is خِفَافٌ and أَخْفَافٌ and أَخِفَّآءُ; the<br>\
first of which three pls. is also pl. of ↓ خُفَافٌ:<br>\
and hence, in the Kur [ix. 41], اِنْفِرُوا خِفَافًا وَثِقَالًا<br>\
[explained in art. ثقل]. (TA.) ↓ خِفٌّ is also<br>\
applied to a boy, (S, TA,) meaning Light to<br>\
