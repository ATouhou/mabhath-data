الخَنَّاسُ The devil: (S, K:) an epithet applied<br>\
to him, (Msb,) because he retires, or shrinks, or<br>\
hides himself, (يَخْنُسُ, S, Msb, K, i. e., يَتَأَخَّرُ, as<br>\

-b2-  [Hence,] الخُنَّسُ, (in the Kur lxxxi. 15, S,)<br>\
(tropical:)  The stars; (S, K;) i. e., all of them; because<br>\
they retire, or hide themselves, (تَخْنُسُ,) at setting;<br>\
or because they become concealed in the day-time:<br>\
(S:) or the planets: (S, K:) or the five stars,<br>\
Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury:<br>\
(Fr, S, K, Jel:) because they return, (تَخْنُسُ, i. c.,<br>\
تَرْجِعُ, Jel,) in their course: (Fr, S, Jel:) when<br>\
you see a star [thereof] in the end of a sign of<br>\
the zodiac, it returns to the beginning of it: (Jel:)<br>\
or because of their retrogression; for they are<br>\
the erratic stars (الكَوَاكِبُ المُتَحَيَّرِةُ), which [at<br>\
one time appear to] retrograde, and [at another<br>\
time to] pursue a direct [and forward] course:<br>\
(S:) or because they sometimes return (تخنس)<br>\
in their course until they become concealed in the<br>\
light of the sun: (TA:) or because they hide<br>\
themselves, as the devil does at the mention of<br>\
God. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And hence, i. e., from خَانِسٌ<br>\
in the sense of مُتَأَخِّرٌ, the saying in a trad. of El-<br>\
Hajjáj, الإِبِلُ ضِمَّرٌ خِنَّسٌ, meaning, (assumed tropical:)  [Camels are<br>\
lean, and lank in the belly, and] patient of thirst.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And اللَّيَالِى الخُنَّسُ The three nights of<br>\
the lunar month during which the moon retires<br>\
[from view]. (TA.)<br>\
أَخْنَسُ [Having a camous, or camoys, nose;]<br>\
having the configuration termed خَنَسٌ in the nose:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) [see خَنِسَ الأَنْفُ:] accord. to some,<br>\
having a nose of which the bone is short and the<br>\
end turning back towards its bone: (TA:) fem.<br>\
خَنْسَآءُ: (S, Msb:) pl. خُنْسٌ. (S, A.) ↓ خَنَسٌ in<br>\
its original application is in gazelles and bulls and<br>\
cows: (TA:) all bulls and cows are خُنْس, (S,<br>\
A, TA,) and so are all gazelles: (TA:) or<br>\
↓ خُنُسٌ, with two dammehs, (K,) but written by<br>\
Sh خُنْسٌ, (TA,) is used to signify gazelles: and<br>\
bulls or cows: (K:) and خَنْسَآءُ is an epithet applied to the wild cow: (K:) also أَخْنَسُ, to the<br>\
tick: (Sgh, K:) and the lion; and so ↓ خِنَّوْسٌ;<br>\
(K;) which last is an epithet so applied as relating to his face and his nose: (Fr, TA:) and<br>\
the last, ↓ خنّوس, is also applied to a young pig:<br>\
(As, TA:) or in this sense it is with ص: (Fr,<br>\
TA:) and ↓ خَنَاسٌ is syn, with خِنَّوْسٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] خُنْسٌ is metaphorically applied [as an<br>\
epithet] to arrows, in the following verse, describing a coat of mail:<br>\
لَهَا عُكَنٌ تَرُدُّ النَّبْلَ خُنْسًا<br>\
وَتْهْزَأُ بِالْمَعَابِلِ وَالْقِطَاعِ<br>\
[It has folds which repel the arrows turned up at<br>\
the points, and mock at the broad and long, and<br>\
the small and broad, arrow-heads]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
قَدَمٌ خَنْسَآءُ A foot flat in the hollow part of the<br>\
sole, and fleshy. (TA.)<br>\
