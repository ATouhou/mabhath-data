El-Marzookee says that the primary signification<br>\
of خَلْطٌ is the intermingling of the particles of a<br>\
thing, one with another. (Msb, TA.) [And hence,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He confused, confounded, or disordered, it.]<br>\

(Mgh, K;) and خَامَرَهُ; (S, A, K, all in art. خمر;)<br>\
[as, for instance,] water with milk. (A in art.<br>\
خمر, and Mgh in the present art.) خِلَاطٌ in relation to camels, and men, and beasts, also signifies Their being mixed together. (K.) A poet<br>\
says,<br>\
يَخْرُجْنَ مِنْ بُعْكُوكَةِ الخِلَاطِ<br>\
[They come forth from the crowding and dust<br>\
(of the beasts) occasioned by the being mixed together]. (Th, TA.) And it is said in a trad.,<br>\
لَا خِلَاطَ وَلَا وِرَاطَ (S, Mgh,) There shall be no<br>\
putting together what is separate, nor separating<br>\
what is put together, from fear of the poor-rate:<br>\
(S:) for the Prophet made it incumbent on a<br>\
person having possessed forty sheep or goats a<br>\
whole year to give one sheep or goat; and so on<br>\
one having possessed more thereof to the number<br>\
of a hundred and twenty, to give one sheep or<br>\
goat; but if they exceeded a hundred and twenty<br>\
by one, two sheep or goats were to be given of<br>\
them: (Az, TA:) i. e. there shall be no putting<br>\
together what is separate; as, for instance, when<br>\
three persons possess a hundred and twenty sheep<br>\
or goats, every one of them having forty, they not<br>\
having been partners for a whole year, and it<br>\
being incumbent on every one of them to give a<br>\
sheep or goat; and when the collector of the poorrate comes to them, they put them together, assigning them to one pastor, in order that they<br>\
may not be obliged to give for them more than<br>\
one sheep or goat: (K, * TA:) accord. to IAth,<br>\
this is termed إِخْلَاطٌ [app. a mistake for خِلَاطٌ]:<br>\
nor shall there be any separating of what is put<br>\
together; i. e., when there are two partners, each<br>\
of them having a hundred and one sheep or goats,<br>\
for which together they are bound to give three<br>\
sheep or goats; and when the collector of the poorrate comes to them, they separate their sheep or<br>\
goats, so that each of them shall not have to give<br>\
more than one sheep or goat: [see also art. ورط:]<br>\
(TA:) or خلاط signifies a man&#39;s mixing his<br>\
sheep or goats when they are eighty in number<br>\
with those of another which are forty in number,<br>\
both together being bound to give two sheep or<br>\
goats while they are separate, in order that one<br>\
[only] may be taken: and وراط, a man&#39;s giving to<br>\
another the half of his sheep or goats when they<br>\
are forty in number, in order that the collector of<br>\
the poor-rate may not take anything: (Mgh:)<br>\
or خلاط is, when there are, between two partners,<br>\
a hundred and twenty sheep or goats, one of them<br>\
having eighty and the other forty, and the collector of the poor-rate has taken two of these sheep<br>\
or goats, the former partner&#39;s restoring to the<br>\
latter the third of a sheep or goat; so that the<br>\
former has had to give a sheep or goat and a<br>\
third; and the latter, two thirds of one: and if<br>\
the collector have taken, from the hundred and<br>\
twenty, one sheep or goat, the former partner&#39;s<br>\
restoring to the latter one third [in some copies<br>\
of the K, erroneously, two thirds] of a sheep or<br>\
goat; so that the former has had to give two<br>\
thirds of a sheep or goat; and the latter, one<br>\
third of one: (ISd, K, * TA:) and وراط is deceiving, and acting dishonestly: (ISd, L, TA:) in<br>\
the place of وراط, we find, accord. to one relation,<br>\
شِنَاق, followed by فِى الصَّدَقَةِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  El-<br>\
&#39;Ajjáj contended with Homeyd El-Arkat in two<br>\

[Beware thou of mixing; or] do not thou mix<br>\
my أُرْجُوزَة with thine [O father of her with the<br>\
shaggy hair]; to which El-&#39;Ajjáj replied, الفِجَاجُ<br>\

possession, or property, is more deserving than<br>\
the neighbour:] (K, TA:) [or the trad. is as<br>\
follows:] الخَلِيطُ مِنَ الشَّرِيكِ وَالشَّرِيكُ أَحَقُّ<br>\
مِنَ الجَارِ أَحَقُّ مِنْ غَيْرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  the sharer in the<br>\
thing itself that is sold has more right than the<br>\
sharer in the rights thereof; and the sharer in<br>\
the rights thereof has more right than the adjoining neighbour; and the adjoining neighbour<br>\
has more right than another: or the meaning<br>\
here is, he between whom and thyself are acts of<br>\
receiving and giving, and affairs of debt and<br>\
credit; not the sharer, or partner. (Mgh.) And<br>\
in another trad., مَا كَانَ مِنْ خَلِيطَيْنِ فَإإِنَّهُمَا<br>\
يَتَرَاجَعَانِ بَيْنَهُمَا بِالسَّوِيَّةِ (assumed tropical:)  Whatever two copartners<br>\
there be that have not divided the beasts [belonging<br>\
to them], they shall make claim for restitution,<br>\
one of the other, with equality; i. e., if they be<br>\
copartners in camels for which it is incumbent to<br>\
give sheep or goats, and the camels be found in<br>\
the possession of one of them, and the poor-rate<br>\
for them be taken from him, he shall make a<br>\
claim for restitution [of what he has given above<br>\
his own share] upon his copartner, with equality:<br>\
(Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, K, TA:) the two persons are not<br>\
خَلِيطَانِ unless they be such as drive back their<br>\
beasts to the nightly resting-place, and drive them<br>\
forth in the morning to the pasturage, and water<br>\
them, together, and have their stallions mixed<br>\
together, and have been copartners for a year;<br>\
and if so, they give the poor-rate as one: otherwise, they are not خليطان; and they give the<br>\
poor-rate as two: (Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, TA:) the trad.<br>\
applies, for instance, to the case of two copartners<br>\
who have mixed their property together; one of<br>\
them having forty bulls or cows or of both kinds;<br>\
and the other, thirty; and the collector of the<br>\
poor-rates takes from the forty a مُسِنَّة [q. v.], and<br>\
from the thirty a تَبِيع [q. v.]; then the giver of<br>\
the مسنّة makes a claim for restitution of three<br>\
sevenths thereof upon his copartner; and the<br>\
giver of the تبيع, of four sevenths thereof upon<br>\
his copartner; for it is incumbent to give the beasts<br>\
of these two ages [the مسنّة and the تبيع] when<br>\
the property is not divided, as though it were the<br>\
property of one: and the saying بالسّوية shows<br>\
that if the collector of the poor-rate wrong one of<br>\
them, and take from him more than the law imposes upon him, he cannot make a claim for<br>\
restitution thereof upon his copartner, who is only<br>\
responsible to him for the value of what falls upon<br>\
him in particular, of what is incumbent by the<br>\
law: and the making claim for [just] restitution,<br>\
by one upon the other, shows that the partnership<br>\
holds good notwithstanding the distinction of the<br>\
things which compose the possessions, with such<br>\
as hold this to be the case. (IAth, TA.)<br>\
