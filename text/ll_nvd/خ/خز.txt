known, (K, TA,) woven of wool and silk: (TA:)<br>\
and also a kind of cloth entirely of silk; and this<br>\
is the kind which one is forbidden to ride upon<br>\
and to sit upon; not the former kind, which is<br>\
allowable, and was sometimes worn by companions of the Prophet and by the next succeeding generation, as IAth has ascertained: (TA:)<br>\
derived from خُزَزٌ, (K, TA,) accord. to some:<br>\
(TA:) or it is the name of a certain beast<br>\
[thought by Golius to be the beaver]: and<br>\
afterwards applied to the cloth made of its fur:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) pl. خُزُوزٌ. (S, A, Msb, K.) [Golius<br>\
seems to derive it from the Persian قَزْ, meaning<br>\
raw silk; and assigns to it also the meaning of<br>\
a coarser kind of spun silk.] خُزُوزٌ وَبُزُوزٌ signifies<br>\
Good cloths, or stuffs, or garments. (A in<br>\
art. بز.)<br>\
خُزَزٌ The male of the أَرْنَب [or hare]: (S, A,<br>\

or young, hare]. (A, TA.)<br>\
