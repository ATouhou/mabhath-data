without regard to the original words; ” and the<br>\

meaning: (MF:) or properly, he abridged the<br>\
expressions, making the words fewer, but preserving the entire meaning: (Msb:) or he<br>\
abridged the language by omitting superfluities,<br>\
and choosing from it concise expressions which<br>\
conveyed the meaning. (L.) [You say, اختصرهُ<br>\
عَلَى الرُّبْعِ (assumed tropical:)  He reduced it by abridgment to the<br>\
fourth of its original bulk.] And اختصر السَّجْدَةَ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He recited the chapter in which a prostration<br>\

(TA:) or he took a مخصرة or a staff in his hand,<br>\
to lean upon it. (Mgh.) You say also, اختصر<br>\
العَنَزَةَ [He took in his hand the عنزة: or he leaned<br>\
upon the عنزة in walking]: it is a thing [i. e. a<br>\
kind of staff, or short spear,] like the عُكَّازَة: and<br>\
in like manner, ↓ تخصّر; as in the L &amp;c.: (TA:)<br>\

or خَصْرَانِ [the dual] signifies the narrow part<br>\
of a sandal. (IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  (tropical:)  The part which is<br>\

خَصِرٌ, applied to a day, Painfully cold. (A,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Cold, as an epithet, (S, K,) applied to<br>\
water, (S,) and to anything. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A man<br>\
feeling cold [especially in his extremities: see 1]:<br>\
to signify cold and hungry, the epithet خَرِصٌ is<br>\
used. (A &#39;Obeyd.) ―<br>\
-b4-  ثَغْرٌ خَصِرٌ [A mouth, or<br>\
front teeth,] cold, or cool, in the place that is<br>\
hissed. (A, TA. [See also مُخَصَّرٌ.])<br>\
خُصَيْرَى, (K, TA,) in some copies of the K<br>\
خُصَيْرِىٌّ, (TA,) [but the former is shown to be<br>\
the right reading by a verse cited in the TA,]<br>\
The curtailment of the superfluities of a thing;<br>\
like اِخْتِصَارٌ. (K, * TA.)<br>\
الخَاصِرَةُ [The flank; i. e. each of the ilia;]<br>\
i. q. الشَّاكِلَةُ; (Zj, in his “ Khalk el-Insán; ” S,<br>\
K;) i. e. the طَفْطَفَة [or quivering flesh] of the<br>\
side, that reaches to the extremities of the ribs:<br>\
(Zj, ibid.:) and [so in the K, but more properly<br>\
“ or,”] الخَاصِرَةُ, (K,) or الخَاصِرَاتَانِ (JK, TA)<br>\
and ↓ الخَصْرَانِ, (TA,) what is between the حَرْقَفَة<br>\
[or crest of the hip] and the lowest rib; (JK,<br>\
K, TA;) i. e. the part from which retires each<br>\
of the lowest ribs, and in advance of which projects each of the حَجَبَتَانِ: [explained by the<br>\
words ما قلص عنه القُصَيْرَيَانِ وتقدّم من الحجبتين:<br>\
but for من الحجبتين, I read مِنْهُ الحَجَبَتَانِ;<br>\
referring, for corroboration, to explanations of<br>\
this last word; and therefore I have rendered<br>\
the passage as above: the meaning seems evidently to be the part between the lowest rib and<br>\
the crest of the hip, on each side:] the thin skin<br>\
which is above the خَصْر is called the طَفْطَفَة:<br>\
so in the M, agreeably with the saying of Ibn-El-Ajdábee, that ↓ الخَصْرُ and الخَاصِرَةُ are syn.;<br>\
i. e., in this sense: [this assertion, however,<br>\
requires consideration; for all the explanations<br>\
of الخاصرة are easily reconcileable:] pl. خَوَاصِرُ<br>\
[which is also used in the sense of the sing. or<br>\
dual]. (TA.) You say رَجُلٌ ضَخْمُ الخَواصِرِ [A<br>\
man large in the flank or flanks]: and Lh mentions the phrase إِنَّهَا لَمُنْتَفِخَةُ الخَوَصِرِ [Verily she<br>\
is inflated, or swollen, in the flank or flanks];<br>\
as though the term خاصرة were applicable to<br>\
every portion [of the flank]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A<br>\
pain in the خَاصِرَة [or flank]: or in the kidneys.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And it is also said to signify A certain<br>\
vein (عِرْق) in the kidney, which occasions pain to<br>\
the person when it is in motion. (TA.)<br>\
خِنْصِرٌ: see art خنصر.<br>\
أَخْصَرُ [Shorter: and shortest]. You say, هٰذَا<br>\
أَخْصَرُ مِنْ ذَاكَ This [road] is shorter than that.<br>\
(A.) But this is irregular; أَخْصَرُ being formed<br>\
from اُخْتُصِرَ, a verb of more than three letters.<br>\
(I&#39; Ak p. 237.)<br>\
مِخْصَرَةٌ A thing like a whip: and anything<br>\
that a man takes (يَخْتَصِرُ) with his hand, and<br>\
holds, such as a staff and the like: (S:) a thing<br>\
which a man takes in his hand, and upon which<br>\
he leans, such as a staff and the like: (K, *<br>\
TA:) a rod [or sceptre] which a king used to<br>\
take in his hand, with which he made signs, or<br>\
pointed, in holding a discourse, or addressing,<br>\
(A, K, *) and accompanied what he said, (A,)<br>\
and in like manner the خَطِيب in reciting a<br>\
خُطْبَة: (K, * TA:) it was one of the insignia of<br>\
kings: (TA:) a rod, or what is termed عَنَزَة, or<br>\
the like, with which the خَطِيب makes signs, or<br>\
points, in addressing the people: (Msb:) a thing<br>\
which a man holds in his hand, such as any of<br>\
the things termed عَصًا and مِقْرَعَةٌ and عَنَزَةٌ and<br>\
عُكَّازَةٌ and قَضِيبٌ, or the like; and upon which he<br>\
sometimes leans: (A &#39;Obeyd:) pl. مَخَاصِرُ. (S,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
مُخَصَّرٌ, applied to a man, (TA,) Slender (K,<br>\
TA) in the waist: (TA:) lean, or lank in the<br>\
belly: (K:) or, in the خَاصِرَة [or flank]: (TA:)<br>\
and البَطْنِ ↓ مَخْصُورٌ is also applied to a man [as<br>\
meaning lank in the belly]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  كَشْحٌ<br>\
مُخَصَّرٌ A thin [flank or rather waist: see a verse<br>\
of Imra-el-Keys cited voce مُذَلَّلٌ]. (S, A, K.)<br>\

(JK, TA) (tropical:)  [A foot that touches the ground with<br>\
its fore part and heel; the middle of the sole<br>\
being hollow and narrow: this meaning, or a<br>\
meaning similar to that of يَدٌ مُخَصَّرَةٌ explained<br>\
below, seems to be indicated in the TA: the<br>\
latter is the meaning accord. to the JK; but this<br>\
[ think doubtful, on account of what here follows]. مُخَصَّرُ القَدَمَيْنِ means (tropical:)  A man whose<br>\
feet touch the ground with the fore part and the<br>\
heel; the middle of the sole being hollow and<br>\
narrow: (S, K:) and you say also ↓ مَخْصُورُ<br>\
القَدَمَيْنِ. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  يَدٌ مُخَصَّرَةٌ, or ↓ مَخْصُورَةٌ,<br>\
(as in different copies of the K,) or both, (TA,)<br>\
(tropical:)  An arm, or a hand, in the wrist of which is<br>\
what is termed ↓ تَخْصِيرٌ, as though it were<br>\
bound: or which has an encircling groove-like<br>\
depression. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  نَعْلٌ مُخَصَّرَةٌ (tropical:)  A sandal<br>\
narrow in the middle. (S, * A, * K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  See<br>\
also خَصْرٌ.<br>\
-A2-  ثَغْرٌ بَارِدُ المُخَصَّرِ [A mouth, or<br>\
front teeth,] cold, or cool, in the place that is<br>\
kissed. (TA. [See also خَصِرٌ.])<br>\
مَخْصُورٌ A man having a complaint of, or a<br>\
pain in, his خَصْر [or waist], or his خَاصِرَة [or<br>\
flank]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also the next preceding<br>\
paragraph, in four places.<br>\
مَخَاصِرُ pl. of مِخْصَرَةٌ. (S, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  مَخَاصِرُ<br>\

↓ المُخْتَصَرَاتُ: (TA:) or مُخْتَصِرَاتُ الطُّرُقِ signifies The roads, or ways, that are near, notwithstanding their ruggedness, but not so easy as<br>\
those that are longer. (L.)<br>\
المُخْتَصَرَاتُ, or مُخْتَصِرَاتُ الطُّرُقِ: see the paragraph next preceding.<br>\
المُتَخَصِّرُونَ, (K,) or المُتَخَصِّرُونَ فِى الصَّلَاةِ,<br>\
(Mgh,) Those who, in praying in the night,<br>\
becoming tired thereby, put their hands upon<br>\
their خَوَاصِر [or flanks]: of such it is said (in a<br>\
trad., IAth, K) that light shall be [seen] on their<br>\
faces (IAth, Mgh, K) on the day of resurrection:<br>\
(IAth, K:) [in other cases, this action is forbidden, or disapproved: see 8:] or, in the instance mentioned above, it may mean those who<br>\
shall rest upon their righteous works on the day<br>\
of resurrection: (IAth, Mgh, TA:) this latter is<br>\
apparently the right meaning: otherwise, two<br>\
trads. contradict each other. (MF.)<br>\
