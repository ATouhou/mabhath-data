رَبَعْتُ فِى الجَاهِلِيَّة وَخَمَسْتُ فِى الإِسْلَامِ [I took<br>\
the fourth part of the spoil in the Time of Ignorance, and I took the fifth part thereof in the<br>\
time of El-Islám]; meaning, I headed the army<br>\
in both those states; for the commander, in the<br>\
Time of Ignorance, used to take the fourth part<br>\
of the spoil; and in El-Islám, the fifth part was<br>\
assigned to him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  خَمَسَ القَوْمَ, (S, A,<br>\

signifies He made fourteen to be fifteen. (T in<br>\
art. ثلث.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And He made forty-nine to be fifty<br>\
with himself. (A&#39;Obeyd, S in that art.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
خَمَسَ الحَبْلَ, aor.<br>\
خَمِسَ, inf. n. خَمْسٌ, He made the<br>\
rope of five strands twisted together. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\

counting the day of the next preceding drinking<br>\
as the first. (TA.) [See خَمْسٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  خَمَسَ, said<br>\

also signifies [The watering of land or seedproduce on the fifth day, counting the day of the<br>\

[See خِمْسٌ.]<br>\
خَمْسٌ fem. of خَمْسَةٌ [q. v.].<br>\
خُمْسٌ: see خُمُسٌ.<br>\
خِمْسٌ The drinking of camels on the fifth day,<br>\
counting the day of the next preceding drinking<br>\
as the first; their drinking one day, then pasturing three days, then coming to the water on<br>\
the fifth day, the first and last days, on which<br>\
they drink, being thus reckoned: this is the correct explanation, accord. to Aboo-Sahl El-Khowlee; and Aboo-Zekereeyà says the like; (TA;)<br>\
or their pasturing three days, and coming to the<br>\
water on the fourth day [not counting the day of<br>\
the next preceding watering; for it is evident that<br>\
this explanation is virtually the same as that preceding]: (S, K:) accord. to Lth, the drinking of<br>\
camels on the fourth day, counting the day on<br>\
which they returned from [the next preceding]<br>\
watering; but Az says, that this is a mistake;<br>\
the day of returning from watering not being<br>\
counted [when it is explained as meaning the<br>\
drinking on the fourth day]: (TA:) pl. أَخْمَاسٌ,<br>\
the only pl. form. (Sb, TA.) [See ظِمْءٌ.] Hence,<br>\
فَلَاةٌ خِمْسٌ [as in copies of the K, or it may be<br>\
فَلَاةُ خِمْسٍ,] A desert in which the water is far<br>\
distant, so that the camels come to the water on<br>\
the fourth day, exclusive of the [next preceding]<br>\
day on which they drank. (Az, K, TA.) Hence<br>\
also the saying, فُلَانٌ يَضْرِبُ أَخْمَاسًا لِأَسْدَاسٍ (S,<br>\
K *) (tropical:)  Such a one makes a pretence of اخماس [or<br>\
fifth-day waterings] for the purpose of اسداس<br>\
[or sixth-day waterings]: i. e., he advances his<br>\
camels from the خِمْس to the سِدْس: (K:) a<br>\
prov.: (TA:) meaning, such a one strives to deceive, or circumvent: (S, K:) applied to him who<br>\
acts towards another with artifice, pretending that<br>\
he obeys him, or complies with his desire: (TA:)<br>\
or to him who pretends one thing while he means<br>\
another: (K:) and taken from the saying, related by AO and IAar, ضَرَبَ أَخْمَاسًا لِأَسْدَاسٍ [He<br>\
made a pretence of اخماس for the purpose of<br>\
اسداس]; said of him who proposes a thing<br>\
whereby he means another thing, which he commences and by slow degrees accomplishes: (TA:)<br>\
for a man, when he desires to make a long journey, accustoms his camels to drink خِمْسًا سِدْسًا<br>\
[i. e. on the fifth day and then on the sixth, in<br>\
each case counting the day of the next preceding<br>\
drinking as the first]: (K, TA:) the origin of<br>\
the saying, accord. to IAar, being this: an old<br>\
man was among his camels, accompanied by his<br>\
sons, men, who pastured them, and who had been<br>\
long far distant from their families; and he told<br>\
them one day to pasture their camels رِبْعًا [i. e.<br>\
watering on the fourth day, counting the day of<br>\
the next preceding watering as the first], which<br>\
they did, proceeding in the way towards their<br>\
families: then they proposed to do so خِمْسًا; and<br>\
then, سِدْسًا: whereupon the old man, understanding what they meant, said, ye are doing<br>\
nothing but making a pretence of اخماس for the<br>\
purpose of اسداس: the object of your desire is<br>\
not the pasturing of them, but it is only your<br>\
families. (TA.) [See below, voce خُمُسٌ, a saying<br>\
similar in words but different in meaning.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
It is also used for سَيْرُ خِمْسٍ [A journey in which<br>\
the camels are watered only on the first and fifth<br>\
days; a journey in which the second and third<br>\
and fourth days are without water]. (L in art.<br>\
جلذ.) You say خِمسٌ بَصْبَاصٌ, [and صَبْصَابٌ,]<br>\
and قَعْقَاعٌ, and حَثْحَاثٌ, [and حَصْحَاصٌ, &amp;c.,]<br>\
i. e. A journey [in which the camels are watered<br>\
only on the first and fifth days,] in the course of<br>\
which, to the water, there is no flagging, by<br>\
reason of its remoteness. (TA.) El-&#39;Ajjáj uses<br>\
the expression<br>\
خِمْسٌ كَحَبْلِ الشَّعَرِ المُنْحَتِّ<br>\
meaning, A [journey of the kind termed] خمس<br>\
without any deviation, like a rope made of hair<br>\
that has fallen off and that is free from any unevenness. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  خِمْسٌ also signifies The<br>\
fifth young one, or offspring. (A in art. ثلث.)<br>\
-A2-  A [garment of the kind called] بُرْد, (S, K,) of<br>\
the fabric of El-Yemen; (S;) so called because<br>\
first made for a king of El-Yemen named خِمْسٌ,<br>\
(AA, S,) or الخِمْسُ; (K, TA;) as also ↓ خَمِيسٌ.<br>\
(TA.) For the latter word, we find in the work<br>\
of Bkh, خَمِيص, with ص; which, if correct, is<br>\
masc. of خَمِيصَةٌ, which is a small kind of كِسَآء.<br>\
(IAth, and L.) [The pl. of خِمْسٌ applied to a بُرْدَة<br>\
is أَخْمَاسٌ.] See also مَخْمُوسٌ, in four places.<br>\
خُمُسٌ and ↓ خُمْسٌ A fifth part; (Msb, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ خَمِيسٌ, (S, in art. ثلث, and IAmb and<br>\
Msb,) agreeably with a rule applicable in the<br>\
case of every one of the units, except ثَلِيثٌ:<br>\
(TA:) some allow this last; but AZ disallows it,<br>\
and خميس also: (S in art. ثلث:) pl. أَخْمَاسٌ.<br>\
(Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] ضَرَبَ أَخْمَاسَهُ فِى<br>\
أَسْدَاسِهِ He turned his five senses towards his six<br>\
relative points; [namely, above, below, before,<br>\
behind, right, and left:] an allusion to the collecting all the thoughts to examine a thing, and<br>\
turning the attention in all directions. (MF.)<br>\
خَمْسَةٌ, (S, K,) masc.; and خَمْسٌ, fem.; (S;)<br>\
[Five;] a certain number. (S, K.) You say<br>\
خَمْسَةُ رِجَالٍ [Five men], and خَمْسُ نِسْوَةٍ [Five<br>\
women]. (S.) You say also, عِنْدِى خَمْسَةُ دَرَاهِمْ<br>\
[I have five dirhems], with refa: and if you<br>\
please, you incorporate the ة into the د [and say,<br>\
خَمْسَة دَّرَاهِمَ]: but when you prefix ال to دراهم,<br>\
you say, عِنْدِى خَمْسَةُ الدَّرَاهِمِ [I have the five<br>\
dirhems], with damm; and may not incorporate,<br>\
because you have incorporated the ل into the د:<br>\
and in the case of a fem. n. you say, عِنْدِى خَمْسُ<br>\
القُدُورِ [I have the five cooking-pots]: also, هٰذِهِ<br>\
الخَمْسَةُ الدَّرَاهِمِ [These five dirhems]; and, if you<br>\
please, الدَّرَاهِمُ, using it in the manner of an<br>\
epithet: and in like manner [you use the other<br>\
nouns of number] to عَشَرَةٌ [inclusive]. (S.) You<br>\
say also, صُمْنَا خَمْسًا مِنَ الشَّهْرِ [We fasted during<br>\
a period of five nights of the month with their<br>\
days]; making لَيَالٍ to predominate over أَيَّام,<br>\
when you do not mention the word ايّام, though<br>\
the fasting is in the day; because the night of<br>\
each day precedes the day: but when you mention the word ايّام, you say, صُمْنَا خَمْسَةَ أَيَّامٍ [We<br>\
fasted five days]. (ISk, TA.) يَعَضُّ بِالخَمْسِ<br>\
means He bites the fingers: these being [five in<br>\
number and] of the fem gender: (Ham p. 790:)<br>\
[i. e.] خَمْسٌ means the five fingers. (Har p. 76.)<br>\
[Respecting a peculiar pronunciation of the<br>\
people of El-Hijáz, and a case in which خَمْسَة is<br>\
imperfectly decl., see ثَلَاثَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ,<br>\
masc.; and خَمْسَ عَشْرَةَ, fem.; Fifteen. For<br>\
variations thereof, see art. عشر.]<br>\
خَمْسُونَ [Fifty, and fiftieth,] is also written<br>\
and pronounced خَمِسُونَ, with kesr to the خَمَسُونَ, by<br>\
poetic license, as related by Ks; or م, with<br>\
fet-h, as related by others, after the manner of<br>\
خَمْسَةٌ and خَمَسَاتٌ: (Fr, TA:) accord. to the T,<br>\
the variation خَمِسُونَ, with kesr to the م, is<br>\
[dialectic, being] similar to خَمْسَ عَشِرَةَ, with kesr<br>\
to the ش [in the dial. of Nejd]. (TA.)<br>\
جَاؤُوا خُمَاسَ, and ↓ مَخْمَسَ, They came five<br>\
and five; [or five and five together; or five at a<br>\
time and five at a time;] (K, TA;) like as they<br>\
say, ثُنَآءَ and مَثْنَى, and رُبَاعَ and مَرْبَعَ: (TA:)<br>\
or, accord. to A &#39;Obeyd, not more than أُحَادَ and<br>\
ثُنَآءَ and ثُلَاثَ and رُبَاعَ has been heard, except<br>\
عُشَارَ occurring in a verse of El-Kumeyt. (TA in<br>\
art. عشر.)<br>\
خَمِيسٌ: see خُمُسٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and مَخْمُوسٌ, in two<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b3-  An army; because consisting of five<br>\
parts, namely, the van, the body, the right wing,<br>\
the left wing, and the rear; (S, A, K;) or because<br>\
the spoils are divided into fifths among it; but<br>\
this latter assertion requires consideration; (ISd,<br>\
MF;) for this division of the spoils is an affair of<br>\
the Muslim law, whereas خميس [thus applied] is<br>\
an old term: (MF:) or an army having numerous<br>\
weapons; syn. جَيْشٌ خَشِنٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  يَوْمُ الخَمِيسِ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) and simply الخَمِيسُ, Thursday; the<br>\
fifth day of the week; thus used for الخَامِسُ, in like<br>\
manner as الدَّبَرَانُ is applied to the star [that<br>\
follows the Pleiades, for الدَّابِرُ]: (TA:) pl. [of<br>\
pauc.] أَخْمِسَةٌ and [of mult.] أَخْمِسَآءُ (S, Msb, K)<br>\
and أَخَامِسُ. (Fr, TA.) AZ used to say, مَضَى<br>\
الخَمِيسُ بِمَا فِيهِ [Thursday passed with what<br>\
happened in it], making it sing. and masc.: but<br>\
Abu-l-Jarráh used to say, مَضَىالخَمِيسُ بِمَ فِيهِنَّ,<br>\
making it pl. and fem., and using it as a n. of<br>\
number. (Lh, TA.) It has no dim. (Sb, S in<br>\
art. امس.)<br>\
-A2-  See also خِمْسٌ, last signification.<br>\
-A3-  مَا أَدْرِى أَىُّ خَمِيسِ النَّاسِ هُوَ means I know<br>\
not what company of men it is. (Ibn-&#39; Abbád,<br>\
Sgh, K.)<br>\
خُمَاسِىٌّ A boy five spans (أَشْبَار) in height:<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, * K:) said of him who is increasing in height [but has not attained his full<br>\
stature]: (Msb:) fem. with ة: (Lth, TA:) and<br>\
in like manner you say رُبَاعِىٌّ: (S, Msb:) but<br>\
you do not say سُبَاعِىٌّ, (Lth, S, K,) nor سُدَاسِىٌّ;<br>\
(Lth, K;) [i. e., in speaking of a boy;] for when<br>\
he has attained seven spans, (S,) or six spans,<br>\
(Lth, K,) he is a man: (Lth, S, K:) or to a<br>\
slave you apply the epithet سداسىّ also; and to<br>\
a garment, or piece of cloth, سباعىّ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\

خَمِيسِىٌّ One who fasts alone on Thursday.<br>\

(ISk, S, K;) whence the phrase, جَآئَ فُلَانٌ<br>\
خَامِيًا [Such a one came fifth], for خَامِسًا: (ISk,<br>\
S:) [fem. with ة.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [خَامِسَ عَشَرَ and خَامِسَة<br>\
عَشْرَةَ, the former masc. and the latter fem., meaning Fifteenth, are subject to the same rules as<br>\
ثَالِثَ عَشَرَ and its fem., explained in art. ثلث,<br>\
q. v.]<br>\
-A2-  إِبِلٌ خَامِسَةٌ (TA) and خَوَامِسُ (S, K)<br>\
Camels that drink on the fifth day, counting the<br>\
day of the next preceding drinking as the first:<br>\

pentagonal. (S.) [See also مُثَلَّثٌ.]<br>\
مَخْمُوسٌ Five cubits in length; applied to a<br>\
spear, (S, A, K,) as also ↓ خَمِيسٌ; (K;) and to<br>\
a garment, or piece of cloth, (S, A, K,) as also<br>\
↓ خَمِيسٌ, (S, A, Mgh, K,) which occurs in a trad.<br>\
as meaning a small garment or piece of cloth,<br>\

in like manner, ↓ بُرْدَةُ أَخْمَاسٍ a [garment of the<br>\
kind called] بردة fire cubits long. (ISk, TA.)<br>\
Hence the saying, ↓ هُمَا فِى بُرْدَة أَخْمَاسٍ (assumed tropical:)  They<br>\
two have become near together, and in a state of<br>\
agreement. (K.) A poet says,<br>\
صَيَّرَنِى جُودُ يَدَيهِ وَمَنْ<br>\
↓ أَهْوَاهُ فِى بُرْدَةِ أَخْمَاسِ<br>\
i. e., (assumed tropical:)  The bounty of his hands has made me and<br>\
the person whom I love to be near together, as<br>\
though we were in a بردة five cubits long: (Th,<br>\
TA:) app. meaning that the person thus spoken<br>\
of had purchased for him a female slave, or had<br>\
given for him the dowry of his wife. (Az, Sgh,<br>\
TA.) You also say, ↓ لَيْتَنَافِى بُرْدَةِ أَخْمَاسٍ, a<br>\
prov., meaning (assumed tropical:)  Would that we were near together. (ISk, TA.) [See also بُرْدٌ.] ―<br>\
