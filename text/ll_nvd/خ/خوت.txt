-b3-  And خات<br>\
He (a man, TA) lessened, diminished, or impaired,<br>\
his provision of corn or food (مِيرَتَهُ); or made it<br>\
defective, or deficient. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  خات, (aor. as<br>\

↓ يَتَخَوَّتُ, (S,) Such a one takes of the discourse<br>\
of the people, or party, and learns it by heart<br>\
[one part after another]. (S, K. *) In [some of]<br>\
the copies of the K, in the explanation of اختات<br>\
الحَدِيثَ, for فَتَحَفَّظَهُ is erroneously put فَتَخَطَّفَهُ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\

meaning is masc.; and the same is said in the<br>\
TA, doubtless from another copy of the S; but<br>\
this observation, which is omitted in one copy of<br>\
the S in my possession, applies to خَوَاةٌ, mentioned<br>\

says,<br>\
فَلَاحِسَّ إِلَّا خَوَاتُ السُّيُولِ<br>\
[And there was no sound but the noise of the<br>\
torrents]; (AHn, TA;) which shows that we<br>\
should read in the K وَالسَّيْلِ; not والسيلُ, as in<br>\
some copies. (TA.)<br>\
