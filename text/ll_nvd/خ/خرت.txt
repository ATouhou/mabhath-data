خَرَتَ, (K,) aor.<br>\
خَرُتَ, inf. n. خَرْتٌ, (TK,) He<br>\
perforated, bored, or pierced, (K,) the ear, (TK,)<br>\
or a thing. (TA.) And خَرَتَ أَنْفَ الجَمَلِ [It perforated, or slit, (see the pass. part. n., below,)<br>\
the nose of the camel]: said of the خِشَاش [or<br>\
wooden thing that is inserted in the bone of the<br>\
camel&#39;s nose]. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  خَرَتْنَا الأَرْضَ We knew<br>\
the land and its roads. (Ks, S.) [Golius omits<br>\
this; but mentions, as on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof, خَرِتَ, signifying He was skilful, or<br>\
expert, in showing the way. What Ibn-Maaroof<br>\
says, however, is that the inf. n. خَرَتٌ signifies<br>\
the being acquainted with a road; and, with a<br>\
place. See خِرِّيتُ.]<br>\
خَرْتٌ: see what next follows, in two places.<br>\
خُرْتٌ The perforation, bore, or hole, (S, A, K,)<br>\
of a needle; [i. e. its eye;] (S, A; [see also<br>\
خُرْتَةٌ;] and of the ear, (S,) or in the ear, [but<br>\
see خُرْتَةٌ,] &amp;c.; (A, K;) and of the فَأْس, [i. e.<br>\
hoe, or adz, or axe,] (S, A, TA,) meaning, of the<br>\
handle thereof; (A, TA;) as also خُرَةٌ; (Fr, TA<br>\
in art. خرو;) [see again خُرْتَةٌ;] and ↓ خَرْتٌ signifies the same: (A, K:) pl. [of pauc.] أَخْرَاتٌ<br>\
(S, A) and [of mult.] خُرُوتٌ. (S.) You say<br>\
أَضْيَقُ مِنْ خُرْتِ الإِبْرَةِ [Narrower than the eye<br>\
of the needle]. (A.) And مَضَايِقُ كَأَخْرَاتِ الإِبَرِ<br>\
[Narrow passes like the eyes of needles]. (A.)<br>\
The خُرْت of a sandal is The hole, or perforation,<br>\
of the ذُؤَابَة [q. v.], into which the thong [called<br>\
the شِرَاك] enters. (An anon. Arabic MS. in my<br>\
possession.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The rings at the heads [or<br>\
extremities] of [camels&#39; plaited fore-girths of the<br>\
kind called] نُسُوع; and so [the pls.] خُرَتٌ (K)<br>\
and أَخْرَاتٌ: (S, K:) and ↓ خُرْتَةٌ signifies one of<br>\
these; (K;) i. e. the ring in which is [inserted<br>\
the end of] the نِسْعَة. (TA.) [Hence the phrase,]<br>\
قَلِقَ خُرْتُ فُلَانٍ [lit. The rings of the fore-girths<br>\
of the camels of such a one became unsteady;<br>\
meaning] (tropical:)  the state of such a one became<br>\
disordered, or perverted. (A, TA.) And similar<br>\
to this are the phrases, رَادَ خُرْتُ القَوْمِ and رَادَتْ<br>\
أَخْرَاتُهُمْ, [in the TA زاد and زادت, but the comparison evidently shows that the verbs should be<br>\
راد and رادت,] said of a people when they do not<br>\
receive or entertain hospitably him who alights<br>\
at their place of abode: so says IAar on the<br>\
authority of Es-Saloolee. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also خُرْتَةٌ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Also A small rib, at, or near, the breast; and<br>\
so ↓ خَرْتٌ: (K:) pl. أَخْرَاتٌ, which Lth explains<br>\
as meaning the ribs at, or near, the breast, collectively. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And [the pl.] أَخْرَاتٌ signifies The obscure roads or ways, and the narrow<br>\
passes, of a desert. (TA.)<br>\
خُرْتَةٌ: see خُرْتٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Its pl. أَخْرَاتٌ, [also pl. of<br>\
↓ خُرْتٌ, (see خُبْنٌ,)] in the formation of which<br>\
the ة of the sing. seems to have been considered<br>\
as elided, also signifies The loops of a [leathern<br>\
water-bag such as is called] مَزَادَة: it is said in<br>\
the T that in the مزادة are its اخرات, the loops<br>\
between which is the قَصَبَة [commonly signifying<br>\
cane, or reed, but here app. meaning the mouth,<br>\
which has the form of a short cylinder, and is in<br>\
the middle of the upper part of the مزادة, between<br>\
the two loops, these being at the two upper<br>\
corners], whereby [app. referring to the اخرات]<br>\
it is carried [and suspended on the side of a<br>\
camel, counterpoised by another مزادة on the<br>\
other side of the camel]: and AM adds that one<br>\
says [also] أَخْرَابُ المَزَادَةِ, sing. خُرْبَةٌ [q. v.];<br>\
and in like manner, خُرْبَةُ الأُذُنِ [“ the bore of the<br>\
ear ” ]; with ب: and غُلَامٌ أَخْرَبُ الأُذُنَيْنِ [“ a<br>\
boy having his ears pierced, or bored ”]: he says,<br>\
also, that the خُرْتَة, with ت, is [the hole] in the<br>\
iron of the فَأْس, and [the eye] of the needle; and<br>\
the خُرْبَة, with ب, is in the skin: and AA says<br>\
that خُرْتَةٌ signifies the eye of the [kind of needle<br>\
called] شَغِيزَة, i. e. the مِسَلَّة: (TA:) and Lth says<br>\
that it signifies a round hole. (TA in art. حرت.)<br>\
الخَرَاتَانِ Two stars, (K,) of the stars of the<br>\
Lion, two whips&#39; lengths apart, [(see سَوْطٌ,) in]<br>\
the two shoulder-blades of the Lion, (TA,) also<br>\
called زُبْرَةُ الأَسَدِ, (K,) [composing the Eleventh<br>\
Mansion of the Moon: (see زُبْرَةٌ: and see also<br>\
مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل:)] the word is mentioned<br>\
here in the K, as though it were of the measure<br>\
فَعَالَانِ; but accord. to Kr and others, it is dual<br>\
of خَرَاةٌ, belonging to art. خرو, in which it is<br>\
again mentioned in the K: (TA:) accord. to<br>\
ISd, however, only the dual form is known, and<br>\
the radical ت and the augmentative ت [by which<br>\
latter is meant ة] are in the dual alike: (TA in<br>\
art. خرو:) Zj asked Th respecting the خراتان,<br>\
and he answered, IAar says that they are two<br>\
stars, of those of the Lion; and Aboo-Nasr, the<br>\
companion of As, says that they are two stars in<br>\
the زبرة of the Lion, i. e. in the middle thereof;<br>\
but in my opinion they are two stars after [i. e.<br>\
to the eastward of] the جَبْهَة and the قَلْب: Zj<br>\
disapproved of this, and replied, I say that they<br>\
are two stars in that part of the breast which is<br>\
the stabbing-place, derived from خُرْتُ الإِبْرَةِ, “the<br>\
eye of the needle: ” but Th rejoined, that this<br>\
was an error, because the word is the dual of<br>\
خَرَاةٌ; and he cited some verses in which a poet<br>\
speaks of certain stars in the Lion, and, among<br>\
them, of الخَرَاةُ. (MF, TA.)<br>\
خِرِّيتُ (S, A, K) and خِرِّيتٌ مِرِّيتٌ (Sh) A<br>\
skilful, or an expert, guide of the way; (Sh, S,<br>\
K;) one who pursues the right course to the<br>\
أَخْرَات, i. e. the obscure roads or ways, and the<br>\
narrow passes, of the deserts; or who pursues the<br>\
right course in a way that may be likened to the<br>\
خُرْت [or eye] of the needle: (TA:) or skilful;<br>\
applied to a man, and [particularly] to a guide:<br>\
(A:) pl. خَرَارِتُ, occurring in a verse [perhaps<br>\
used by poetic licence for the regular pl. خَرَارِيتُ].<br>\
(S.)<br>\
مَخْرَتٌ A strait, direct, or right, road or<br>\
way. (K.)<br>\
مَخْرُوتٌ originally Perforated, bored, or pierced.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Then, (TA,) Having the nose slit;<br>\
(K;) [and] so مَخْرُوتُ الأَنْفِ, applied to a camel:<br>\
(A, TA:) or مخروت signifies having a slit lip.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
