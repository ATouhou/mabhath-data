خَافَ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) originally خَوِفَ,<br>\
(Lth, L, &amp;c.,) first pers. خِفْتُ, (TA,) aor. يَخَافُ,<br>\
(S, K, &amp;c.,) originally يَخْوَفُ, (L,) imperative<br>\
خَفْ, (S,) inf. n. خَوْفٌ (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and<br>\
↓ خِيفٌ, [originally خِوْفٌ,] (Lh, TA,) erroneously<br>\
written in the K with fet-h [to the خ], but some<br>\
say that this is a simple subst., not an inf. n.,<br>\
(TA,) and ↓ خِيفَةٌ, (Lh, S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) originally خِوْفَةٌ, (K,) but some say that this also is<br>\
a simple subst., not an inf. n., (TA,) and [therefore] its pl. is خِيفٌ, (Lh, JK, S, and so in the<br>\
CK,) in [some of] the copies of the K erroneously<br>\
written خِيَفٌ, (TA,) or this [as well as the next<br>\
preceding] may be an inf. n., for some few inf. ns.<br>\
have pls., (ISd, TA,) and مَخَافَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,<br>\
&amp;c.,) originally مَخْوَفَةٌ, for which last, the first<br>\
of these inf. ns. is used by a poet, and therefore<br>\
made fem., (TA,) He feared; he was afraid or<br>\
frightened or terrified; syn. فَزِعَ. (K.) It is<br>\
also trans.: (Msb:) you say, خَافَهُ and ↓ تخوّفهُ<br>\
[He feared, or was afraid of, him, or it]; (Msb,<br>\
TA;) both signifying the same: (TA:) [and so<br>\
خَافَ مِنْهُ; or this may mean he feared what<br>\
might happen to him from him, or it:] and<br>\
عَلَيْهِ شَيْئًا ↓ تخوّف, meaning خَافَهُ [i. e. خَافَ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
شَيْئًا He feared for him a thing]: (S, K:) and<br>\
خَاَفَهُ عَلَى مَالِهِ and عَلَيْهِ ↓ تخوّفهُ [He feared him,<br>\
or it, for his property]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] it<br>\
is also used in the sense of ظَنَّ [He thought, or<br>\
opined]: and in this case, the Arabs sometimes<br>\
use it in the same manner as a verb signifying an<br>\
oath, and give it the same kind of complement;<br>\
as in an ex. cited voce دَرِدَ [q. v.]. (S in art. درد.)<br>\
And He knew. (Lh, Kr, K.) Hence, وَإِنِ امْرَأَةٌ<br>\
خَافَتْ مِنْ بَعْلِهَا نُشُوزًا [And if a woman know that<br>\
there is, on the part of her husband, injurious<br>\
treatment, or unkindness, or estrangement], (K,)<br>\
in the Kur [iv. 127]. (TA.) And hence also,<br>\
فَمَنْ خَافَ مِنْ مُوصٍ جَنَفًا [And he who knoweth<br>\
that there is, on the part of the testator, an inclining to a wrong course, or a declining from the<br>\
right course, &amp;c.], (K,) in the Kur [ii. 178];<br>\
thus explained by Lh. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  خَافَهُ, (S,) first<br>\
pers. خُفْتُهُ, (K,) aor. يَخُوفُهُ, (S,) He exceeded<br>\
him in fear. (S, K. *) You say, فَخَافَهُ ↓ خَاوَفَهُ,<br>\
(S,) inf. n. of the former مُخَاوَفَهُ, (TA,) i. e. [He<br>\
vied with him to see which of them would exceed<br>\
the other in fear, and] he exceeded him in<br>\
fear. (S.)<br>\
2<br>\
خوّفهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. تَخْوِيفٌ, (TA,) i. q.<br>\
أَخَافَهُ. (Msb, K.) See the latter, in two places.<br>\
He put fear into him. (JK, TA.) خَوِّفْنَا [app.<br>\
addressed to God] is mentioned by Lh as meaning<br>\
Render the Kur-án and the Traditions beautiful<br>\
to us in order that we may [give heed thereto and]<br>\
fear. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He made him to be in such a<br>\
state, or condition, that men feared him; (JK,<br>\
K;) he made him to be feared by men. (M.)<br>\
Hence, in the Kur [iii. 169], إِنَّمَا ذٰلِكُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ<br>\
يُخَوِّفُ أَوْلِيَآءَهُ, i. e. [Verily that is the devil:] he<br>\
causeth his friends to be feared by you: [or that<br>\
devil causeth &amp;c.:] or, as Th says, causeth you<br>\
to fear by his friends. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  He diminished<br>\
it, lessened it, or took from it; and so خوّف مِنْهُ.<br>\
(TA.) [See also 5.] ―<br>\
-b2-  خوّف غَنَبَهُ He sent away<br>\
his sheep, or goats, flock by flock. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
خَاْوَفَ see 1, last sentence.<br>\
4<br>\
اخافهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. إِخَافَةٌ (S) and إِخَافٌ,<br>\
like كِتَابٌ, (Lh, TA,) [but the latter is irreg. and<br>\
rare,] He, or it, (an affair, a case, or an event,<br>\
Msb,) caused him, or made him, to fear, or be<br>\
afraid; put him in fear; frightened, or terrified,<br>\
him; (TA;) and ↓ خوّفهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَخْوِيفٌ, (S, TA,) signifies the same. (S, Msb,<br>\
K.) So in the phrase اخاف الثَّغْرُ [The enemies&#39;<br>\
frontier caused to fear, &amp;c.; was insecure:] or<br>\
fear entered from it. (TA.) You say also, مَالَ<br>\
الحَائِطُ فَأَخَافَ النَّاسَ [The wall leaned, and caused<br>\
the people to fear]. (Msb.) And أَخَافَ اللُّصُوصُ<br>\
الطَّرِيقَ [for أَخَافَ اللُّصُوصُ أَهْلَ الطَّرِيقِ The robbers caused the people of the road, or the passengers thereof, to fear, &amp;c.; or it may be<br>\
rendered the robbers caused the road to be insecure]. (Msb.) And أَخَفْتُهُ الأَمْرَ فَخَافَهُ [I caused<br>\
him to fear the thing, or affair, &amp;c., and he<br>\
feared it; making the verb doubly trans.]; as<br>\
also إِيَّاهُ فَتَخَوَّفَهُ ↓ خَوَّفْتُهُ. (Msb.) It is said in a<br>\
trad., أَخِيفُوا الهَوَامَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ تُخِيفَكُمْ Make ye the<br>\
venomous reptiles and the like to fear before they<br>\
make you to fear; (TA;) i. e. kill ye them before they kill you. (JM, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَا أَخْوَفَنِى<br>\
عَلَيْكَ [How greatly do I fear for thee!]. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تخوّفهُ: see 1, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  Also He<br>\
took by little and little (S, L, K) from it, (S, K,)<br>\
or from its sides; (L;) as also تحوّفهُ: (S and<br>\
K * in arts. حوف and حيف:) or he took from its<br>\
extremities; so in the A; in which it is said to<br>\
be tropical: accord. to IF, it is originally [تخوّن,]<br>\
with ن [in the place of the ف]. (TA.) Dhu-rRummeh says, (S,) or not he, but some other<br>\
poet, for it is ascribed to several different authors,<br>\
(L,)<br>\
تَخَوَّفَ الرَّحْلُ مِنْهَا تَامِكًا قَرِدًا<br>\
كَمَا تَخَوَّفَ ظَهْرَ النَّبْعَةِ السَّفَنُ<br>\
[Her saddle abraded from a long and high, compact hump, like as when the piece of skin used for<br>\
smoothing arrows has abraded from the back of a<br>\
rod of the tree called نبعة]. (S. [See also 5 in<br>\
art. حوف, where another reading of this verse is<br>\
given. In the TA, in the present art., in the<br>\
places of الرحل and ظهر, I find السَّيْرُ and عُود.])<br>\
Hence, (S, K,) accord. to Fr, (TA,) أَوْيَأَخَذِهِمْ<br>\
عَلَى تَخَوُّفٍ, (S, K,) in the Kur [xvi. 49], (S,)<br>\
which Az explains as meaning [Or are they<br>\
secure from his destroying them] by causing them<br>\
to suffer loss [by little and little] in their bodies<br>\
and their possessions, or cattle, and their fruits:<br>\
or, accord. to Zj, it may mean, after causing<br>\
them to fear, by destroying a town, so that the<br>\
one next to it shall fear. (TA.) You say also,<br>\
تخوّف مِنْ مَالِى He took by little and little from<br>\
my property. (JK.) And تَخَوَّفَنَا السَّنَةُ [The<br>\
year of drought, or sterility, took from us by<br>\
little and little]. (JK.) And تَخَوّفَنِى حَقِّى<br>\
[He diminished to me by little and little my<br>\
right, or due]. (JK.) And تَخَوَّفَهُ حمْقُهُ (tropical:)  i. q.<br>\
اهْضَمَهُ [an evident mistranscription for اِهْتَضَمَهُ or<br>\
هَضَمَهُ, meaning His stupidity deprived him of<br>\
his right, or due]. (TA.)<br>\
خَافٌ A man very fearful or timorous; (S, K;)<br>\
[and so, in the present day, ↓ خَوَّافٌ; the former<br>\
originally] of the measure فَعِلٌ, like فَرِقٌ and فَزِعٌ;<br>\
and similar to صَاتٌ, meaning a man “ having a<br>\
strong, or loud, voice: ” (S:) or i. q. ↓ خَائِفٌ:<br>\
(TA:) accord. to Kh, it may be [originally<br>\
خَاوِفٌ,] of the measure فَاعِلٌ, having the medial<br>\
radical rejected; or [خَوْفٌ,] of the measure فَعْلٌ;<br>\
and in either case, the dim. is [↓ خُوَيْفٌ,] with و:<br>\
so says Sb. (TA.)<br>\
خَوْفٌ inf. n. of 1. (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
Slaughter: whence, وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ بِشَىْءٍ مِنَ الْخَوْفِ<br>\
[And we will assuredly try you with somewhat of<br>\
slaughter]; (Lh, K;) in the Kur [ii. 150]. (TA.)<br>\
[See also 4.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And Fighting: whence, فَإِذَا جَآءَ<br>\
الخَوْفُ [But when fighting cometh; in the Kur<br>\
xxxiii. 19]. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also خَائِفٌ.<br>\
-A3-  Also A<br>\
red hide from which are cut strips like thongs,<br>\
(Kr, K, TA,) and then upon these are put [ornaments of the kind termed] شَذْر; worn by a girl:<br>\
(TA:) a dial. var. of حَوْفٌ [q. v.]: (K:) but<br>\
this latter is preferable. (L, TA.)<br>\
خِيفٌ: see 1, first sentence.<br>\
خَافَةٌ A [coat of the kind called] جُبَّة, of hide,<br>\
or leather, which the collector of honey wears;<br>\
(Akh, JK, K;) and also worn by the water-carrier: (JK:) or a fur-garment, or hide with<br>\
the fur or wool on it, worn by him who enters<br>\
into the places occupied by bees, in order that<br>\
they may not sting him: (TA:) or a [pouch of<br>\
the kind termed] خَرِيطَة, (S, K,) of hide, or<br>\
leather, (S,) narrow in the upper part and wide<br>\
in the lower part, (TA,) in which honey is collected: (S, K:) or a [round piece of leather with<br>\
a running string by means of which it may be<br>\
converted into a bag, such as is termed] سُفْرَة, like<br>\
the خَرِيطَة, made, or sewed, small, [for مُصْعَدَةٌ or<br>\
مُصَعَّدَةٌ, which I find in different copies of the<br>\
K, and to which no appropriate meaning is<br>\
assignable, I read مُصْغَرَةٌ or مُصَغَّرَةٌ, (see 2 in art.<br>\
صغر, and particularly أَصْغَرَ القِرْبَةَ,)] having its<br>\
head [or border] raised, for honey; (K;) so says<br>\
Skr, in explaining the following verse: or, as IB<br>\
says, accord. to Aboo-&#39;Alee, it is from the phrase<br>\
النَّاسُ أَخْيَافٌ, meaning “ men,” or “ the people,”<br>\
“ are different, one from another; ” for it is a<br>\
خَرِيطَة of hide, or leather, embellished with different kinds of embellishment; and if so it should<br>\
be mentioned in art. خيف: (TA:) [but] the<br>\
dim. is ↓ خُوَيْفَةٌ. (JK.) Aboo-Dhu-eyb says,<br>\
[describing a collector of wild honey,]<br>\
تَأَبَّطَ خَافَةً فِيهَا مِسَابٌ<br>\
فَأَصْبَحَ يَقْتَرِى مَشَدًا بِشِيقِ<br>\
(S,) [He put beneath his armpit a خافة in which<br>\
was a receptacle for honey, and betook himself to<br>\
making successive endeavours to reach the most<br>\
difficult part of a mountain by means of a rope,<br>\
or rope of palm-fibres; for] he means شِيقًا بِمَسَدٍ;<br>\
the phrase being inverted: (S and TA in art.<br>\
شيق:) or he means, [betook himself to] taking<br>\
successive holds of a rope (يَتَتَبَّعُ حَبْلًا) tied to a<br>\
شيق [here best rendered mountain-top] in his<br>\
descent to the place of the honey; so that there is<br>\
no inversion. (TA in that art.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also i. q.<br>\
عَيْبَةٌ [A kind of basket, or receptacle, of hide, or<br>\
leather]; (TA;) the thing in which fruits are<br>\
gathered; also called مِخْرَفٌ. (Har p. 374.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And خَافَةُ الزَّرْعِ is said to mean The envelope of<br>\
the grain of seed-produce; so called because it<br>\
protects it: to this the believer is likened in a<br>\
trad. [as some relate it]; but the reading [commonly known] is [خَامَة,] with م. (TA.) [See<br>\
خامة, in art. خيم.]<br>\
خِيفَةٌ; pl. خِيفٌ: see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Sometimes it may mean, agreeably with analogy, A<br>\
kind of fear.]<br>\
-A2-  See also art. خيف.<br>\
خَوَافٌ Vociferation, clamour, or a confused<br>\
noise, of a company of men. (JK, Sgh, K.)<br>\
خُوَيْفٌ: see خَافٌ.<br>\
خُوَيْفَةٌ: see خَافَةٌ.<br>\
خَوَّافٌ: see خَافٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, perhaps,] A certain black bird: ISd says, I know not why it is<br>\
thus called. (TA.)<br>\
خَائِفٌ Fearing; being afraid or frightened or<br>\
terrified: (S, * TA:) pl. خُوَّفٌ (S, K) and خُيَّفٌ,<br>\
(S,) or خِيَّفٌ, (K,) or, accord. to Ks, خُيَّفٌ and<br>\
خِيفٌ and خُوفٌ, (L,) [but the second and third of<br>\
these three should be خِيَّفٌ and خُوَّفٌ, for all are<br>\
said to be of the measure فُعَّلٌ,] and ↓ خَوْفٌ;<br>\
or this last is a quasi-pl. n.; (K;) whence, in the<br>\
Kur [vii. 54], خَوْفًا وَطَمَعًا, meaning Worship ye<br>\
Him fearing his punishment and eagerly desiring<br>\
his recompense. (TA.) See also خَافٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
see مَخُوفٌ.<br>\
طَرِيقٌ مُخَافٌ [for مُخَافٌ أَهْلُهُ, A road of which<br>\
the people, or passengers, are caused to fear, by<br>\
robbers]. (Msb.) [See also what next follows.])<br>\
طَرِيقُ مَخُوفٌ A road in which people fear:<br>\
(S, * Msb, K:) or a road that is feared; (JK,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ مَخِيفٌ, and ↓ خَائِفٌ; which last<br>\
is tropical, of the measure فَاعِلٌ in the sense of the<br>\
measure مَفْعُولٌ; (TA;) or, thus applied, this<br>\
last [is a possessive epithet, and thus] means<br>\
having fear: (JK: [see also مُخَافٌ:]) you<br>\
should not say ↓ طَرِيقٌ مُخِيفٌ, because the road<br>\
does not cause fear, but only he who robs and<br>\
slays therein. (S, * K, * TA.) One says also ثَغْرٌ<br>\
↓ مَخِيفٌ and ↓ مُتَخَوَّفٌ An enemies&#39; frontier [that<br>\
is feared, or] from which one fears, or from the<br>\
direction of which fear comes. (TA.) مَخُوفٌ<br>\
signifies A thing [of any kind] that is feared; as<br>\
a lion, and a serpent, and fire, and the like. (Har<br>\
p. 369.) [Hence,] حَائِطٌ مَخُوفٌ A wall of which<br>\
the falling is feared. (Lh, Msb, TA. [See also<br>\
مُخِيفٌ.]) And وَجَعٌ مَخُوفٌ [A pain that is<br>\
feared]. (TA. [See, again, مُخِيفٌ.]) And<br>\
أَمْرٌ مَخُوفٌ [An affair, or event, that is feared].<br>\
(Mgh, Msb. [See, again, مُخِيفٌ.]) And فَاسِقٌ<br>\
مَخُوفٌ عَلَى مَالِهِ A transgressor who is feared<br>\
for his property, that he will consume it, and expend it in that which is not right. (Mgh.)<br>\
مَخِيفٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places: and see also what next follows.<br>\
حَائِطٌ مُخِيفٌ (Msb, K, in the CK ↓ مَخِيفٌ,)<br>\
A wall that causes one to fear that it will fall.<br>\
(Msb, K. * [See also مَخُوفٌ.]) And وَجَعٌ مُخِيفٌ<br>\
(S, K) A pain that causes him who sees it to fear.<br>\
(S. [See, again, مَخُوفٌ.]) And أَمْرٌ مُخِيفٌ An<br>\
affair, or event, that is formidable; that causes<br>\
him who sees it to fear. (Msb. [See, again,<br>\
مَخُوفٌ.]) And المُخِيفُ means The lion, (K,<br>\
TA,) that frightens him who sees him. (TA.)<br>\
See also مَخُوفٌ, first sentence.<br>\
أَخْوَفٌ [More, and most, formidable, fearful,<br>\
or feared: anomalous, like its syn. أَخْشَى, being<br>\
from the pass. verb. Hence,] أَخْوَفُ مَا أَخَافُ<br>\
عَلَيْكُمْ كَذَا [The most formidable, or fearful, of<br>\
what I fear for you is such a thing]. (Mgh, *<br>\
TA.)<br>\
مَخَافَةٌ an inf. n. of 1, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) originally مَخْوَفَةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also A cause of fear:<br>\
a word of the same category as مَجْبَنَةٌ and مَبْخَلَةٌ<br>\
&amp;c.: pl. مَخَاوِفُ. Hence,] أَوَّلُ كُتُبِهِ المَخَاوِفُ<br>\
[The first of his letters, or epistles, consisted of<br>\
the causes of fear]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And مَخَاوِفُ also<br>\
signifies Places of fear. (KL.)<br>\
مُتَخَوَّفٌ: see مَخُوفٌ.<br>\
