-A2-  خَضَرَ: see<br>\
8, in two places.<br>\
2<br>\
خضّرهُ, [inf. n. تَخْضِيرٌ,] He rendered it أَخْضَر<br>\
[i. e. green, &amp;c.]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] it is said in<br>\
a trad., إِذَا أَرَادَ اللّٰهُ بِعَبْدٍ شَرًّا خَضَّرَ لَهُ فِى اللَّبِنِ<br>\
وَالطِّينِ حَتَّى يَبْنِىَ, (TA,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [When God<br>\
desires evil to befall a man,] He makes him to<br>\
have pleasure in unburnt bricks and clay, so that<br>\
he may build, and thus be diverted from the<br>\
things of the world to come, if his building be<br>\
beyond his need, or not such a structure as a<br>\
mosque or the like. (Marginal note in a copy of<br>\
the “ Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer ” of Es-Suyootee.) [Hence<br>\
also,] خُضِّرَ لَهُ فِيهِ, inf. n. as above, (tropical:)  He was<br>\
blessed in it. (L, K.) You say, مَنْ خُضِّرَ لَهُ فِى<br>\
شَىْءٍ فَلْيَلْزَمْهُ, (L,) or مَنْ خُضِّرَ مِنْ شَىْءٍ فليلزمه,<br>\
(so in a copy of the Mgh,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Whosoever is<br>\
blessed in a thing, (Mgh, L,) meaning an art or a<br>\
trade or traffic, or a means of subsistence, let him<br>\
keep to it. (L.)<br>\
3<br>\
خاضرهُ, (TK,) inf. n. مُخَاضَرَةٌ, (S, A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) He sold to him fruits before they were<br>\
in a good, or sound, state: (A:) or before their<br>\
goodness, or soundness, became apparent: (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K, TK:) the doing of which is forbidden: (S:) accord. to some, (TA,) the prohibition includes the sale of fresh ripe dates,<br>\
[app. if not fully ripe,] and herbs, or leguminous<br>\
plants, and the like; and therefore some disapprove of selling a greater quantity of fresh ripe<br>\
dates than is cut at once. (S.)<br>\
4<br>\
اخضر It (plenty of moisture) rendered seedproduce soft, or tender. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اختضر He cut herbage, (S, K,) or a tree,<br>\
(A,) while it was green; (S, A, K;) as also<br>\
↓ خَضَرَ, (A, TA,) aor.<br>\
خَضُرَ, inf. n. خَضْرٌ. (TA.)<br>\
And اُخْتُضِرَ It (herbage, TA) was taken, (K,)<br>\
and pastured upon, (TA,) while fresh and juicy,<br>\
(K,) and green, before it had attained its full<br>\
height. (TA.) See also 9, last sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, (S, TA,) the pass. form, (assumed tropical:)  He died in his<br>\
youth; (S, K;) in his fresh and flourishing<br>\
state. (S.) Young men used to say to an old<br>\
man, أَجْزَرْتُ يَا شَيْخُ (assumed tropical:)  [Thou hast attained to the<br>\
time for dying, (lit. for being cut,) O old man]:<br>\
and he replied, أَىْ بَنِىَّ وَتُخْتَضَرُونَ (assumed tropical:)  [O my sons,<br>\
and ye shall be cut off, or die, in your youth]. (S.<br>\
[See also أَجْزَرَ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, the act. v., He cut off<br>\
the green branches of a palm-tree with his مِخْلَب;<br>\
(TA;) and so ↓ خَضَرَ, (K, * TA,) aor.<br>\
خَضُرَ, inf. n. خَضْرٌ:<br>\
(TA:) and he cut off a thing, as a man&#39;s nose, entirely: (TA:) or, simply, he cut off a man&#39;s nose.<br>\
(IAar.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And He ate fruit [while it was green,<br>\
or] before it was ripe. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And hence, (TA,)<br>\
(tropical:)  He deflowered a girl: (K, TA:) or, before she<br>\
had attained to puberty; (Msb in art. قض, and<br>\
K;) as also اِبْتَسَرَ and اِبْتَكَرَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
took a camel in a refractory state, not trained,<br>\
and attached the nose-rein to him, and drove<br>\
him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And (assumed tropical:)  He took up a load, or<br>\
burden. (K.)<br>\
9<br>\
اخضرّ, (S, A, K,) inf. n. اِخْضِرَارٌ; (S, A;)<br>\
and ↓ اخضوضر, (S, K,) [inf. n. اِخْضِيضَارٌ, in the<br>\
TA written by mistake اِخْضِيرَارٌ;] and ↓ حَضِرَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
خَضَرَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. خَضَرٌ; (Msb;) It (a<br>\
colour, Msb, or seed-produce, K) was, or became,<br>\
of the colour termed خُضْرَة [i. e. green: and he,<br>\
(a camel, and a horse, and an ass, and sometimes<br>\
a bird,) and it, (a garment of the kind called<br>\
كِسَآء, and the like, or any other thing,) was, or<br>\
became, of a dark, or an ashy, dust-colour; or<br>\
dingy ash-colour; or dark dust-colour: and he,<br>\
(a man,) or it, (a thing,) was, or became, of a<br>\
tawny, or brownish, colour; or blackish; or of<br>\
a blackish hue inclining to green; or black; or<br>\
intensely black: see خُضْرَةٌ and أَخْضَرُ]. (S, A,<br>\
Msb, K.) [Hence,] اخضرّ إِزَارَى (The place of)<br>\
my ازار became black: or, rather, became of a<br>\
[blackish] hue inclining to green: because the<br>\
hair when it first grows is of that hue. (Har<br>\
p. 494.) And اخضرّ شَارِبُهُ [His mustache grew<br>\
so as to appear dark]; said of a boy; a phrase<br>\
similar to بَقَلَ وَجْهُهُ. (Mgh in art. بقل.) And<br>\
اخضرّاللَّيْلُ (tropical:)  The night became dark and black.<br>\
(K, * TA.) And اخضرّت الظُّلْمَةُ (tropical:)  The darkness<br>\
became intensely black. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اخضرّ جِلْدَتُهُ<br>\
[properly His skin became green from carrying<br>\
the produce of his land; meaning] (tropical:)  he became in<br>\
a state of plenty. (TA. [See هُمْ خُضْرُ المَنَاكِبِ,<br>\
voce أَخْضَرُ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  اخضرّ said of seed-produce, It<br>\
was, or became, soft, or tender; as also ↓ اخضوضر;<br>\
and ↓ خَضِرَ, aor.<br>\
خَضَرَ, (TA,) inf. n. خَضَرٌ. (K, *<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اخضرّ and ↓ اِخْتَضَرَ, (K,) or this may be<br>\
of the pass. form, [اُخْتُضِرَ,] so as to agree with<br>\
what occurs before, [see 8,] (TA,) It (herbage,<br>\
TA) was, or became, cut. (K, * TA.)<br>\
12<br>\
إِخْضَوْضَرَ see 9, first sentence: ―<br>\
-b2-  and last sentence<br>\
but one.<br>\
خَضْرٌ Trees (شَجَرٌ) that are soft, or tender,<br>\
when cut; as also ↓ مَخْضُورٌ. (TA.)<br>\
خُضْرٌ: see خُضَارَةٌ.<br>\
خِضْرٌ [i. q. خَضِرٌ]. You say, أَخَذَهُ خِضْرًا مِضْرًا,<br>\
and مَضِرًا ↓ خَضِرًا, He took it without price: or<br>\
in its fresh, or juicy, state: (K:) مضرا being an<br>\
imitative sequent. (TA.) Whence the saying,<br>\
مَضِرَةٌ ↓ الدُّنْيَا خَضِرَةٌ [in the S حُلْوَةٌ خَضِرَةٌ] The<br>\
goods of this world are delicate, fresh, and pleasant: or pleasing. (TA.) And ↓ الغَزْوُ حُلْوٌ خَضِرٌ<br>\
[Predatory warfare is sweet and] fresh [or refreshing] and loved; because of the victory and<br>\
spoil attending it. (TA, from a trad. of Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Omar [which see fully quoted voce ثُمَامٌ].) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
You say also, هُوَلَكَ خِضْرًا مِضْرًا It is thine, or for<br>\
thee: may it be attended with enjoyment and a<br>\
wholesome result. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And ذَهَبَ دَمَهُ خِضْرًا<br>\
مِضْرًا, (S, K,) and مَضِرًا ↓ خَضِرًا, (K,) His blood<br>\
went unrevenged, or unretaliated, or unexpiated<br>\
by a mulet: (S, K:) مضرا being an imitative<br>\
sequent [here as in the former instance]. (TA.)<br>\
خَضَرٌ inf. n. of خَضِرَ: [see 9, first sentence: ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
and last sentence but one; and] see also خُضْرَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also Green palm-branches with the leaves<br>\
upon them: and green palm-branches stripped of<br>\
their leaves: (Fr, K:) pl. أَخْضَارٌ. (AHn.)<br>\
خَضِرٌ: see أَخْضَرُ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A place having much<br>\
verdure; and so ↓ يَخْضُورٌ and ↓ مَخْضَرَةٌ. (K.)<br>\
And أَرْضٌ خَضِرَةٌ and ↓ يَخْضُورٌ Land in which is<br>\
much verdure: and ↓ ارض مَخْضَرَةٌ, as in the Kur<br>\
xxii. 62, accord. to one reading, verdant land.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also خِضْرٌ, in four places. ―<br>\
-b4-  Also,<br>\
[as a subst.,] What is green: (Akh, S, and Bd<br>\
in vi. 99:) seed-produce; (Lth, Bd, K;) and so<br>\
↓ خُضَّارَى: (S:) so the former in the Kur ubi<br>\
suprà: (Lth, Bd:) or goodly green herbage: (A:)<br>\
and a branch: (K:) any branch. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And الخَضِرُ The plant called ↓ البَقْلَةُ الخَضْرَآءُ; as<br>\
also ↓ الخَضِرَةُ and ↓ الخَضِيرُ (K) and ↓ الخُضْرَةُ:<br>\
(TA:) it is a green and rough herb or leguminous<br>\
plant, the leaves and fruit of which are like those<br>\
of millet; it rises to the height of a cubit; and<br>\
fills the mouth of the camel. (TA.) Also A<br>\
species of plant of the kind called جَنْبَة; (K;)<br>\
which latter term is applied to herbage whereof<br>\
the root is deep in the earth, like the نَصِىّ and<br>\
صِلِّيَان: (TA:) [a coll. gen. n.:] n. un. with ة:<br>\
(K:) it is not of the slender and succulent herbs<br>\
or leguminous plants, which dry up in summer.<br>\
(TA.) Hence آكِلَةُ الخَضِرِ, occurring in a trad.,<br>\
[properly signifying A she-camel that eats the<br>\
plant above mentioned,] applied to a man who<br>\
acts justly and moderately with respect to worldly<br>\
enjoyments: for the خضر is not of the slender<br>\
and succulent herbs, as above observed, nor of<br>\
those excellent plants which the spring produces<br>\
by its consecutive rains, and which therefore become goodly and soft or tender; but of those<br>\
upon which beasts pasture after others have dried<br>\
up, because they find no others, and which the<br>\
Arabs call جَنْبَة; and the beasts do not eat much<br>\
of it, nor do they find it wholesome. (IAth,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
خَضْرَةٌ [if not a mistranscription for خُضْرَةٌ]<br>\
Fresh cut herbage, to be eaten quickly. (TA.)<br>\
خُضْرَةٌ [Greenness; a green colour; verdure;]<br>\
a certain colour, (S, A, K,) well known; (K;)<br>\

plants and in animals &amp;c., and, accord. to IAar,<br>\
in water also: (TA:) in camels, (S,) and horses,<br>\
(S, K,) [and asses, and sometimes in birds, and<br>\
in a garment of the kind called كِسَآء, and the<br>\
like, and in other things, a dark, or an ashy,<br>\
dust-colour; or dingy ash-colour; or dark dustcolour;] a dust-colour intermixed with دُهْمَة [i. e.<br>\
blackness or deep ash-colour]: (S, K:) in men,<br>\
[and in other things,] a tawny, or brownish,<br>\
colour; syn. سُمْرَةٌ: (S:) [and a blackish hue:<br>\
and a blackish hue inclining to green:] and blackness: (TA:) [and intense blackness: see 9; and<br>\
see also أَخْضَرُ:] pl. خُضَرٌ and خُضْرٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And A green plant: pl. خُضَرٌ: (TA:) or the<br>\
latter signifies herbs, or leguminous plants; as<br>\
though pl. of the former. (Msb.) [See خَضَارٌ:<br>\
and خَضْرَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  See also خَضِرٌ. ―<br>\
-b4-  Also Softness,<br>\
or tenderness, (IAar, K,) of seed-produce [and<br>\
the like]; (TA;) and so ↓ خَضَرٌ, (K,) inf. n. of<br>\
خَضِرَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And What is soft, or tender;<br>\
fresh, or juicy; and pleasant to the eater. (TA,<br>\
from a خُطْبَة of &#39;Alee, delivered at El-Koofeh.)<br>\
الخَضِرَةٌ: see خَضِرٌ.<br>\
خُضْرِيَّةٌ A palm-tree (نَخْلَةٌ) that bears good<br>\
green dates. (Az, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A kind of dates, green,<br>\
resembling glass, of a colour that is admired.<br>\
(AHn.)<br>\
خَضَارٌ Herbs, or leguminous plants, in the first<br>\
state of their growth. (S, * K, * TA.) [See also<br>\
خُضْرَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Milk mixed with much water:<br>\
(S, K:) AZ says that it is like سَمَارٌ, meaning as<br>\
above, diluted so as to be of a dark, or an ashy,<br>\
dust-colour (حَتَّى اخْضَرَّ): like as the rájiz says,<br>\
جَاؤُوا بِضَيْحٍ هَلْ رَأَيْتَ الذِّئْبَ قَطْ<br>\
[They brought milk mixed with much water.<br>\
Hast thou ever seen the wolf?]: meaning that<br>\
the milk was of an ash-colour (أَوْرَق), like the<br>\
colour of the wolf, by reason of the great quantity<br>\
of the water: or, as some say, milk and water<br>\
in the proportion of one third of the former to<br>\
two thirds of the latter: it is of any milk, that<br>\
has been kept in a skin or that is fresh, and from<br>\
any beast: some say that the word is a pl., [or<br>\
rather a coll. gen. n.,] and that the sing., or<br>\
n. un., is with ة. (TA.)<br>\
خَضُورٌ: see أَخْضَرُ.<br>\
خَضِيرٌ: see أَخْضَرُ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also خَضِرٌ.<br>\
خُضَيْرٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
خُضَارَةٌ: see أَخْضَرُ, in the latter half of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  خُضَارَةٌ, determinate, and imperfectly<br>\
decl., (ISk, S, K,) because it has the quality of a<br>\
proper name and the fem. gender with ة, like<br>\
أُسَامَةٌ &amp;c., (TA,) (tropical:)  The sea; (ISk, S, A, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ الأَخْضَرُ, and ↓ خُضَيْرٌ, (A, TA,) or ↓ خُضْرٌ.<br>\
(So in a copy of the A.) [But it is used as a masc.<br>\
proper name; for] you say, هٰذَا خُضَارَةُ طَامِيًا<br>\
[This is the sea, in a state of rising, or becoming<br>\
full, or becoming high and full]. (S, TA. [In<br>\
one copy of the S, I find هٰذِهِ; but in others,<br>\
هٰذَا; and in all, طَامِيًا.])<br>\
خَضِيرَةٌ A palm-tree (نَخْلَةٌ) of which the dates<br>\

خُضَارِىٌّ A certain bird; (S, K;) also called<br>\
the أَخْيَل; (S;) regarded as of evil omen when it<br>\
alighted upon the back of a camel: it is أَخْضَر<br>\
[i. e. green, or of a dark or an ashy dust-colour],<br>\
with redness in the حَنَك [or part beneath the<br>\
beak], and is larger than the قَطَا: or certain<br>\
green, or dark or ashy dust-coloured, birds,<br>\
(طَيْرٌ خُضْرٌ,) also called قَارِيَة: A &#39;Obeyd asserts<br>\
that the Arabs loved them, and likened to them a<br>\
liberal, or bountiful, man: but ISd says, on the<br>\
authority of the &#39;Eyn, that they regarded them as<br>\
of evil omen: (TA:) [Golius states, on the<br>\
authority of Meyd, that the خضارىّ is a bird of a<br>\
blackish colour, called in Persian كَرايَهْ. See<br>\
Bochart&#39;s Hieroz. p. ii. col. 61; referred to by<br>\
Freytag.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The [tree, or shrub, called]<br>\
رِمْث, when it has grown tall. (TA.)<br>\
خُضَّارٌ A certain bird, (K,) green or of a dark<br>\

خُضَّارَى: see خَضِرٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A certain plant.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
أَخْضَرُ [Green; verdant;] of the colour termed<br>\
خُضَّارَى; (S, A, Msb, K;) as also ↓ خَضِرٌ (Msb, K)<br>\
and ↓ خَضِيرٌ and ↓ خَضُورٌ and ↓ يَخْضُورٌ and<br>\
↓ يَخْضِيرٌ: (K, TA: the last two written in the<br>\
CK تَخْضُورٌ and تَخْضِيرٌ:) applied to a horse,<br>\
[and to a camel, (see خُضْرَةٌ,) and to an ass, and<br>\
sometimes to a bird, and to a garment of the kind<br>\
called كِسَآء, and the like, and to various other<br>\
things, of a dark, or an ashy, dust-colour; or<br>\
dingy ash-colour; or dark dust-colour;] of a<br>\
dust-colour intermixed with دُهْمَة [i. e. blackness<br>\
or deep ash-colour]; which is the same as دَيْزَجٌ;<br>\
(S;) in horses being distinguished as أَخْضَرُ أَدْغَمُ<br>\
and أَخْضَرُ أَطْحَلُ and أَخْضَرُ أَوْرَقُ: (TA: [see<br>\
the latter epithet in each of these cases:]) applied to a man, [and to other things,] tawny, or<br>\
brownish: (S:) [and blackish: and of a blackish<br>\
hue inclining to green:] and black; (S, K;)<br>\
black-complexioned: (TA:) [and intensely black:<br>\
it is said in the Msb, art. حتم, that الأَخْضَرُ is,<br>\
with the Arabs, أَسْوَدُ; which may mean either<br>\
that green is, with the Arabs, termed اسود, or<br>\
that الاخضر is, with the Arabs, black: but the<br>\
truth is, that each of the epithets أَخْضَرُ and أَسْوَدُ<br>\
is sometimes used for the other: see what here<br>\
follows, and see أَسْوَدُ: in Har p. 495, it is erroneously said, on the authority of Er-Rázee, that<br>\
the اسود is not termed by the Arabs اخضر, although<br>\
the اخضر is termed by them اسود because of its<br>\
intense خُضْرَة and رِىّ:] the fem. is خَضْرَآءُ: and<br>\
the pl. is خُضْرٌ. (Msb, TA.) You say شَجَرَةٌ خَضْرَآءُ<br>\
A green, and fresh, or juicy, tree. (TA.) And<br>\
مَآءٌ أَخْضَرُ Water inclining to a green colour, by<br>\
reason of its clearness. (TA.) And أَخْضَرُ الجِلْدَةِ<br>\
[lit. Tawny of skin:] meaning (assumed tropical:)  of pure race;<br>\
because the complexions of the Arabs are tawny;<br>\
(S;) of genuine Arab race: (IB:) as in the saying of El-Lahabee, (S, TA,) El-Fadl Ibn-&#39;Abbás,<br>\
(TA,)<br>\
وَأَنَا الأَخْضَرُ مَنْ يَعْرِفُنِى<br>\
أَخْضَرُ الجِلْدَةِ فِى بَيْتِ العَرَبْ<br>\
[And I am the tawny: who knows me? the<br>\
tawny of skin (or pure of race), of the family<br>\
that comprises the nobility of the Arabs]. (S,<br>\
IB.) And فُلَانٌ أَخْضَرُ القَفَا [lit. Such a one is<br>\
blackish, or black, in the back of the neck:] meaning (tropical:)  such a one is the son of a black woman:<br>\
(Az, A:) or (tropical:)  one who is slapped on the back of<br>\
his neck: (A:) or (tropical:)  a freedman, or an emancipated slave. (TA.) And أَخْضَرُ البَطْنِ (tropical:)  A<br>\
weaver: (A, TA:) because his belly, being stuck<br>\
close to his loom, becomes blackened by it. (TA.)<br>\
And أَخْضَرُ النَّوَاجِذِ (tropical:)  An eater of onions and leeks:<br>\
or a tiller, or cultivator, of the ground; because<br>\
he eats herbs, or leguminous plants. (A.) And<br>\
هُمْ خُضْرُ المَنَاكِبِ [lit. They are green in the<br>\
shoulders, from carrying the produce of their<br>\
land:] meaning (tropical:)  they are in a state of great<br>\
plenty. (K, TA.) And [hence, perhaps,] فُلَانٌ<br>\
أَخْضَرُ (tropical:)  Such a one possesses abundant خَيْر [or<br>\
wealth, or prosperity]: (A, TA:) [or it may<br>\
mean goodness: for] الأَخْضَرُ, applied to a man,<br>\
is an epithet of praise, whereby he may be likened<br>\
to the sea, because it is described as green, or to<br>\
the [rain or herbage called] رَبِيع; in both cases<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  liberal, or bountiful; and it is so applied because خُضْرَةٌ is of the colours of the Arabs:<br>\
and it is also an epithet of dispraise, as meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  black by reason of baseness, ignobleness, or meanness. (Ham p. 282.) And شَابٌّ أَخْضَرُ (tropical:)   A young<br>\
man whose hair has begun to grow upon the sides<br>\
of his face. (TA.) And كَتِيبَةٌ خَضْرَآءُ (tropical:)  An army,<br>\
or a troop of horse, overspread with the blackness<br>\
of iron: (S, TA:) or a great army or troop of<br>\
horse (K, TA) of which most of the men are clad<br>\
in iron; like جَأْوَآءُ: (TA:) because of the خُضْرَة<br>\
of the iron: (A:) [i. e.] because of the blackness<br>\
thereof. (TA.) And اللَّيْلُ أَخْضَرُ (tropical:)  Night is black.<br>\
(TA.) And [hence,] جَنَّ عَلَيْهِ أَخْضَرُ الجَنَاحَيْنِ<br>\
(tropical:)  Night [lit. the black-winged] veiled him, concealed him, or covered him with its darkness.<br>\
(A.) مُدْهَامَّتَانِ, in the Kur [lv. 64, relating to<br>\
two gardens of Paradise], is explained by خَضْرَاوَانِ<br>\
because it means Inclining to blackness, by reason<br>\
of abundance of moisture, or irrigation. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
الأَخْضَرُ used as a subst.: see خُضَارَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  The fem.<br>\
خَضْرَآءُ [is also used as a subst., and] signifies<br>\
Gree herbs or leguminous plants; (Msb, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ خُضَارَةٌ: (K:) pl. خَضْرَاوَاتٌ: by rule it<br>\
should be خُضْرٌ; but as the quality of a subst.<br>\
predominates in it, it has a pl. like the pl. of a<br>\
subst., like صَحْرَاوَاتٌ pl. of صَحْرَآءٌ: (Msb:) this<br>\
pl. occurs in the saying (in a trad., TA) لَيْسَ فِى<br>\
