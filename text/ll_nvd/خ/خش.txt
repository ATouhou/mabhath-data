خَشَّ فِيهِ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
خَشِ3َ, (JM,) [vulgarly,<br>\
and irregularly,<br>\
خَشُ3َ,] inf. n. خَشٌّ, (TA,) He (a<br>\
man) entered into it; (S, K;) namely, a thing;<br>\
(S;) as also ↓ انخشّ; (K, A, TA;) and ↓ خَشْخَشَ,<br>\
(TA,) inf. n. خَشْخَشَةٌ; (K, TA;) and in like<br>\
manner, into a collection of trees, and a company<br>\
of people: (A, * TA:) or فِيهِ ↓ خَشْخَشَ, (IDrd,)<br>\
and فيه ↓ تَخَشْخَشَ, (IDrd, K,) he entered into it,<br>\
(namely, a thing, IDrd, or a collection of trees,<br>\
K, and in like manner a company of men, TA,)<br>\
so as to become hidden, or concealed: (IDrd, K:)<br>\
and خَشَّ, he (a man) went, or went away, or<br>\
advanced, [into a thing,] and penetrated. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Hence, (TA,) خَشَّ البَعِيرَ (S, K,) aor.<br>\
خَشُ3َ,<br>\
[agreeably with general rule in this case,] inf. n.<br>\
خَشٌّ, (S,) He put into the camel&#39;s nose the thing<br>\
termed خِشَاش; (S, K;) as also ↓ أَخَشَّ. (Zj, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And hence the saying in a trad., خُشُّوا بَيْنَ<br>\
كَلَامِكُمْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ, meaning, (assumed tropical:)  Introduce ye, or<br>\
insert ye, in your speech the words There is no<br>\
deity but God. (TA.) And ↓ خَشْخَشَهُ likewise<br>\
signifies He introduced, or inserted, him or it.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also خَشَّهُ, aor. and inf. n. as above, He<br>\
pierced him, or stabbed him. (TA.)<br>\

خَشْخَشَ: see خَشَّ فِيهِ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  خَشْخَشَهُ: see 1, last signification but one.<br>\

-A2-  Also It<br>\
made a sound (S, K) such as is described below,<br>\
voce خَشْخَشَةٌ. (S.) &#39;Alkameh Ibn-&#39;Abadeh says,<br>\
تَخَشْخَشَ أَبْدَانُ الحَدِيدِ عَلَيْهِمُ<br>\
يَبْسَ الحَصَادِ جَنُوبُ ↓ كَمَا خَشْخَشَتُ<br>\
[The short coats of mail of iron rustled upon them,<br>\
like as when a south wind has caused to rustle<br>\
the dry reaped corn]. (S.)<br>\
خَشٌّ: see مَخْشُوشٌ.<br>\
خَشَاشٌ: see خِشَاشٌ; for the former, in three places.<br>\
خُشَاشٌ: see خِشَاشٌ; for the former, in three places.<br>\
خِشَاشٌ The wooden thing that is inserted in<br>\
the bone of the nose of the camel, (S, A, K,) to<br>\
which the nose-rein is tied, in order that he may<br>\
be quickly submissive: (TA:) the بُرَة is of brass,<br>\
(S, TA,) or of silver; (TA;) and the خِزَامَة is of<br>\
hair: (S:) or the thing that is put in the nose;<br>\
and the برة is the thing that is put in the flesh:<br>\
(Lh:) or what is in the bone, when it is wood, or<br>\
a stick; and the عِرَان is what is in the flesh,<br>\
above the nose: (As:) a wooden thing, or stick,<br>\
that is put in the bone of the nose of the camel:<br>\
(Msb:) n. un. with ة: (S, Msb:) pl. أَخِشَّةٌ. (A,<br>\
Msb.) [Hence the saying,] جَعَلَ الخِشَاشَ فِى<br>\
أَنْفِهِ وَقَادَهُ إِلَى الطَّاعَةِ بِعُنْفِهِ (tropical:)  [He put the خشاش<br>\
in his nose, and drew him to obedience by his<br>\
violence]. (A, TA.) [And hence, also,] it signifies غَضَبٌ, (IAar, K,) as used in the saying,<br>\
حَرَّكَ خِشَاشَهُ, [lit., He put in motion his خِشَاش:<br>\
meaning, (assumed tropical:)  he roused, or excited, his anger; or]<br>\
he made him angry. (IAar.)<br>\
-A2-  الخِشَاشُ, and<br>\
↓ الخَشَاشُ, (S, K,) the latter form being sometimes used, (S,) which indicates that the former<br>\
is the more chaste, but, accord. to MF, several<br>\
authorities say the contrary, (TA,) and ↓ الخُشَاشُ,<br>\
(K,) or الأَرْضِ ↓ خَشَاشُ, (A &#39;Obeyd, Msb,) and<br>\
خِشَاشُ الأَرْضِ, (Msb,) The creeping things of the<br>\
earth: n. un. with ة, which is syn. with الحَشَرَةُ<br>\
and الهَامَّةُ: (Msb:) the حَشَرَات (A&#39; Obeyd, S, K)<br>\
of the earth, (A&#39; Obeyd, K,) and its هَوَامّ, and<br>\
[other] creeping things, (A &#39;Obeyd,) such as sparrows and the like: (A &#39;Obeyd, K: *) or خِشَاشُ<br>\
الأَرْضِ, and الطَّيْرِ, signify the small ones of beasts<br>\
or creeping things [of the earth], and of birds:<br>\
(A:) IAar is related to have said that it is<br>\
↓ خِشْخَاشٌ, contr. to what is said by the lexicologists in general: and these things are said to have<br>\
their appellation from their entering into the<br>\
earth and concealing themselves; but this assertion<br>\
is not valid: (ISd:) in a trad., for من خشاش<br>\
الارض, one relation substitutes ↓ مِنْ خَشِيشِهَا,<br>\
which has the same meaning: and some say that<br>\
it is ↓ خُشَيْش, a contracted dim. of خشاش; or<br>\
↓ خُشَيِّش, without contraction: (TA:) and<br>\
↓ الخَشَاشُ signifies the bad [meaning ignoble]<br>\
kinds of birds; this being with fet-h only: (As:)<br>\
or birds that do not prey: (IAar, TA voce<br>\
عُقَابٌ:) خِشَاشٌ, with kesr, also signifies the serpent of the mountain; which does not suffer one<br>\
to survive; and the أَفْعَى is the serpent of the<br>\
plain; (El-Fak&#39;asee, K;) which like wise does not<br>\
suffer one to survive: (K:) or a great and<br>\
abominable ثُعْبَان: or a serpent like the أَرْقَم, but<br>\
smaller: or a small, tawny serpent, smaller than<br>\
the ارقم: (TA:) or a white serpent, which seldom<br>\
hurts, between the حُفَّاث and the ارقم: (Aboo-Kheyreh:) or such as is light, or active, and<br>\
small in the head, of serpents: explained also as<br>\
signifying the serpent, without restriction: (TA:)<br>\
and, (K,) or as some say, (TA,) such as has no<br>\
power of defence, [مَا لَا دِفَاعَ لَهُ, as in the CK<br>\
and a MS copy of the K, for which we find in<br>\
some copies of the K, and in the TA, ما لا دِمَاغَ لَهُ<br>\
such as has no brains, which is doubtless a mistake,] of beasts or creeping things of the earth,<br>\
and of birds, (K,) such as the ostrich, and the<br>\
[bustard called] حُبَارَى, and the كَرَوَان [or stonecurlew], and [the bird called] مُلَاعِبُ ظِلِّهِ, and<br>\
the [harmless kinds of] serpent: (TA:) or what<br>\
is small in the head, and slender, of beasts or<br>\
creeping things: and the kite; and [the bird<br>\
called] مُلَاعِبُ ظِلِّهِ: (Aboo-Muslim:) the pl. is<br>\
خشّآء [app. خُشَّآءُ, originally خُشَشَآءُ, unless a mistake for أَخِشَّآءُ, originally أَخْشِشَآءُ]. (TA.)<br>\
خَشِيشٌ, and خُشَيْشٌ, and خُشَيِّشٌ: see خِشَاشٌ.<br>\
خُشَّآءٌ The bone which is protuberant behind the<br>\
ear, (S, Msb, K,) and which is thin, and bare of<br>\
hair: (TA:) originally خُشَشَآءُ, (S, Msb, K,) of<br>\
the measure فُعَلَآءُ; (S;) [but masc., and perfectly<br>\
decl., as being quasi-coordinate to قُرْطَاسٌ, whereas<br>\
the original is fem., and imperfectly decl.; (see<br>\
قُوَبَآءُ;)] like قُوْبَآءٌ, which is originally قُوَبَآءُ; (S,<br>\
Msb;) and these two words are the only instances<br>\
of their kind: (ISk, Msb:) dual خُشَشَاوَان.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
خَشْخَشَةٌ The [clashing, clattering, chinking,<br>\
jingling, rattling, or rustling,] sound of arms, or<br>\
weapons, (S, A, * K,) and the like; (S;) as also<br>\
شَخْشَخَةٌ, but this latter is a dial. var. of weak<br>\
authority: (TA:) and of any dry or hard thing<br>\
rubbing against another such thing: (K:) accord.<br>\
to IDrd, such [sound or thing (for his words are<br>\
ambiguous)] is termed ↓ خَشْخَاشٌ: (TA:) and<br>\
the [rustling] sound of a new garment or piece of<br>\
cloth, when it is put in motion; as also نَشْنَشَةٌ:<br>\
(IAar:) and [a confused sound] such as is heard<br>\
to proceed from the inside of an animal on its<br>\
being hit by an arrow: (JK in art. خشف:)<br>\
and a motion having a sound like the sound of<br>\
arms, or weapons; (TA;) or an audible motion.<br>\
(Mgh in art. خشف.)<br>\
خَشْخَاشٌ A company: (ISd, TA:) or a numerous company of men: (Az, TA:) or a company<br>\
(S, K) in, (K,) or having upon them, (S,) arms,<br>\
or weapons, and coats of mail. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also خَشْخَشَةٌ.<br>\
-A3-  Also A certain plant, (S, Msb,)<br>\
well known; (S, Msb, K;) [namely, the poppy;]<br>\
which is of several species; (K;) i. e., four;<br>\
(TA;) يُسْتَانِىٌّ [or garden-poppy,] (K,) which is<br>\
the white, and this is the most fit for eating, and<br>\
the best thereof is the fresh and heavy; (TA;)<br>\
and مَنْثُورٌ, (K,) which is the wild Egyptian;<br>\
(TA;) and مُقَرَّنٌ, [app. the horned poppy,] (K,)<br>\
the produce of which has an elongated extremity<br>\
like the horn of the bull; (TA;) and زُبْدِىٌّ,<br>\
[app. the spattling poppy,] (K,) which is known<br>\
by the name of بلبس [a word which I have not<br>\
been able to find elsewhere]: (TA:) every one<br>\
of these is soporiferous, and produces torpidness,<br>\
and cools: (K:) used as a suppository, it produces sleep: and the integument [of the capsule]<br>\
has a stronger power of producing sleep than the<br>\
seeds: (TA:) [or rather the seeds have no narcotic power:] from half a drachm of the integument, with cold water, as a draught, taken early<br>\
in the morning, and the like at sleep, has a wonderful effect in stopping a looseness characterized<br>\
by a mixture of humours and by blood, when<br>\
accompanied by heat and inflammation: (K:)<br>\
it is wonderful also that its solid part confines, and its juice relaxes: and when the root,<br>\
or lower part, is taken with water, [and boiled]<br>\
so that the water is reduced to half its quantity,<br>\
it is beneficial as a remedy for diseases of the<br>\
liver arising from thick humour: so says the<br>\
author of the Minháj: (TA:) the n. un. is with<br>\
ة: (Msb:) and the pl. is خَشَاخِشُ [app. a mistake for خَشَاخِيشُ]. (TA.) [See also أَفْيُونٌ.]<br>\
خِشْخَاشٌ: see خِشَاشٌ.<br>\
مَخْشُوشٌ A camel having a خِشَاش put in his<br>\
nose; as also ↓ خَشٌ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
