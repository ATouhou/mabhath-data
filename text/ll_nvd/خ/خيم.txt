خَامَةٌ belongs to the present art., and J has<br>\
erred, (K,) in mentioning it in art. خوم: (TA:)<br>\
[but why this is said, I know not; nor do the<br>\
commentators on this passage, as is observed in<br>\
the TA, give any explanation of it worthy of<br>\
notice:] it signifies A fresh, or juicy, plant: (S,<br>\
Msb: both in art. خوم:) or an ear of corn:<br>\
(IAar, TA:) or a shoot of seed-produce when it<br>\
first grows forth upon a single stalk: (JK:) or<br>\
خَامَةُ الزَّرْع signifies what grows forth, of seedproduce, upon a single stalk: (M, K: *) or the<br>\
fresh, or juicy, bunch thereof: or the fresh, or<br>\
juicy, plant thereof: (M, K:) pl. خَامَاتٌ (Msb)<br>\

الرِّيحُ مَرَّةً هٰكَذَا وَمَرَّةً هٰكَذَا [The similitude of the<br>\
believer is that of the fresh, or juicy, plant of<br>\
seed-produce, &amp;c., which the wind bends, at one<br>\
time thus, and at one time thus]: (S, TA: *) but<br>\
Fr related it differently, saying الحافة, [app. a<br>\
mistranscription for الخَافَة, which see in art.<br>\
خوف,] and explained this as meaning “ the<br>\
bunch ” of seed-produce. (TA.)<br>\
خَيْمَهٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) with which ↓ خَيْمٌ<br>\
is syn., (S, Msb,) [though said by some to be a<br>\
pl., as will be seen below,] A بَيْت [here meaning booth, or the like,] (S, Msb, K,) of any kind<br>\
(K) such as is built, or constructed, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
by the Arabs, (S, Msb,) of the branches of trees:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) so says As, holding that the خيمة<br>\
is only of trees, and that otherwise it is called<br>\
بَيْتٌ [q. v.]: but others hold that it is [a tent;<br>\
i. e.] made with pieces of cloth and tent-ropes;<br>\
because تَخْيِيمٌ signifies the “ remaining, staying,<br>\
dwelling, or abiding; ” wherefore it is thus called,<br>\
as being used on the occasion of alighting: (IB,<br>\
TA:) this latter is the meaning commonly known;<br>\
but accord. to the saying of As, it is tropical:<br>\
(TA:) or, accord. to IAar, it is applied by the<br>\
Arabs only to a construction of four poles roofed<br>\
over with ثُمَام [or panic grass]; and is not of<br>\
cloths; (Mgh, Msb, TA;) the مِظَلَّة, he says,<br>\
being of cloths and of other things: or i. q. مِظَلَّة:<br>\
(TA:) accord. to AHát, the same as the Persian<br>\
خَرْ پُشْتَهْ [lit. “ ass&#39;s back; ” like the French “ dos<br>\
d&#39;âne; ” meaning a high-pitched span-roof]:<br>\
(Mgh:) or any round بَيْت [which may here<br>\
mean either booth or tent]: or three poles, or<br>\
four, over which is laid ثُمَام; by means of which<br>\
one is shaded in the heat: (K:) or poles set up,<br>\
with rafters laid across, covered with trees; so<br>\
that it is cooler than are أَخْبِيَة [pl. of خِبَآء]: or<br>\
poles upon which خِيَام [pl. of خَيْمٌ] are constructed: or a construction of trees and palmbranches with their leaves upon them, which a<br>\
man uses for shade when he brings his camels to<br>\
water: and applied by the Arabs to a بَيْت [or<br>\
tent &amp;c.], and a place of abode [in an absolute<br>\
sense]: (TA:) the pl. of خَيْمَةٌ is خَيْمَاتٌ and خِيَمٌ<br>\
(S, Msb, K) and ↓ خَيْمٌ, (K,) or this last is [a<br>\
coll. gen. n., or] syn. with خَيْمَةٌ, (S, Msb,) and<br>\
خِيَامٌ, (K,) or this is pl. of ↓ خَيْمٌ, (S, Msb,) and<br>\
is applied also to (tropical:)  [women&#39;s vehicles of the kind<br>\
called] هَوَادِج; these being likened to خِيَام [properly so termed]. (TA.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
الشَّهِيدُ فِى خَيْمَةِ اللّٰهِ تَحْتَ العَرْشِ (assumed tropical:)  [The martyr<br>\
is in the tabernacle of God, beneath the empyrean: this signification of خيمة being perhaps<br>\
taken from the phrase<br>\
ἡ σ� degreesηνὴ τοῦ θεοῦ in Rev.<br>\
xxi. 3]. (TA.)<br>\
خَامِىٌّ (K, TA) A preparer of skins, or hides,<br>\
of the kind termed خَامٌ. (TA.)<br>\

خَيَّامٌ and ↓ خِيَمِىٌّ One who applies himself to<br>\
the fabrication of the [kind of tent, or booth,<br>\
called] خَيْمَة. (TA.)<br>\
مَخِيمٌ, like مَكِيلٌ, (in [some of] the copies of<br>\
the K, erroneously, like مِكْتَلٌ, TA, [in the CK<br>\
like مِكْيَلٌ,]) A collection of bundles, or handfuls,<br>\
(جُرَز, [in the CK جِزَر,] of reaped seed-produce.<br>\
