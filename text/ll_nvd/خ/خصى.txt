خَصَاهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. يَخْصِيهِ, (JK,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. خِصَآءٌ (JK, S, Mgh, Msb, K)<br>\
and خَصَآءٌ, mentioned, by MF, from Expositions<br>\
of the Fs, (TA,) and خَصْىٌ, agreeably with<br>\
analogy, occurs in a trad. of Esh-Shaabee, though<br>\
we have not heard it, (Mgh,) He drew forth, or<br>\
extracted, his testicles; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) [he<br>\
gelded, or castrated, him;] namely, a stallion,<br>\
(S,) a sheep or goat, or a horse or similar beast,<br>\
(Lth, JK, TA,) and a man or boy, (TA,) or a<br>\
slave. (Msb.) One says, بَرِئْتُ إِلَيْكَ مِنَ الخِصَآءِ<br>\
[I am irresponsible to thee for castration]. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] كَانَ جَوَادًا فَخُصِىَ [lit. He was a<br>\
fleet and excellent horse, and he was gelded];<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  he was rich, and he became poor.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The poets term satire, and the act of<br>\
overcoming, خِصَآء: one of them says,<br>\
خَصَيْتُكَ يَا ابْنَ حَمْزَةَ بِالقَوَافِى<br>\
كَمَا يُخْصَى مِنَ الحَلَقِ الحِمَارُ<br>\
[(tropical:)  I have emasculated thee, O son of Hamzeh,<br>\
with rhymes, like as the he-ass is emasculated in<br>\
consequence of the disease termed حَلَق; for which,<br>\
it is asserted, (as is said in the TA, art. حلق,)<br>\
there is no remedy but gelding]. (IB, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اخصى [as though meaning (assumed tropical:)  He did away<br>\
with that which rendered him like one emasculated; the ا, app., having a privative property;]<br>\
(tropical:)  he learned one science. (Sgh, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The<br>\
use of إِخْصَآءٌ [its inf. n.] in the sense of خِصَآءٌ<br>\
inf. n. of خَصَى is a mistake. (Mgh.)<br>\
8<br>\
اختصى He castrated himself; or made<br>\
himself a eunuch. (KL.)<br>\
خَصٍ Having a complaint of his خُصَى [or<br>\
testicles]. (K.)<br>\
خُصْىٌ; and the dual خُصْيَانِ: see خُصْيَةٌ, in five<br>\
places.<br>\
خِصْىٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
خُصْيَةٌ A testicle; (El-Umawee, S;) sing. of<br>\
خُصًى; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) it is [one] of the<br>\
organs of generation; (K;) well known; (Msb;)<br>\
and ↓ خِصْيَةٌ signifies the same, (S, K,) and so<br>\
does ↓ خُصْىٌ, (Msb, K,) and ↓ خِصْىٌ; (K;) and<br>\
خُصْوَةٌ is a dial. var., occurring in a trad., but is<br>\
extr.: (Sh, TA:) accord. to some, (Msb,) the<br>\
sing. is خُصْيَةٌ [alone], (T, Msb,) of the fem.<br>\
gender; (T, TA;) and the dual is ↓ خُصْيَانِ, (ElUmawee, T, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) of the masc.<br>\
gender, (T, TA,) without ت, (El-Umawee, S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) irreg., (El-Umawee, S, Msb,) like<br>\
أَلْيَانِ dual of أَلْيَةٌ, (El-Umawee, S,) and خُصْيَتَانِ<br>\
also, (T, Mgh, K,) this latter being sometimes<br>\
used, (T, Mgh,) though rarely, (MF on the<br>\
authority of the Expositions of the Fs,) both<br>\
mentioned by ISh: (T, TA:) AO says, I have<br>\
heard خُصْيَة, with damm, but I have not heard<br>\
↓ خِصْيَة, with kesr; and I have heard ↓ خُصْيَاهُ<br>\
[as the dual], though they did not use ↓ خُصْىٌ as<br>\
the sing.; (S;) IB, however, cites exs. of this<br>\
last as a sing.: (TA:) AA says that الخُصْيَتَانِ<br>\
signifies the two testicles; and ↓ اَخُصْيَانِ, the two<br>\
skins [which compose the scrotum, i. e.,] in which<br>\
are the two testicles; citing an ex. in which the<br>\
latter dual is used in this sense; (S;) and ISk<br>\
says the like; whereas IKoot makes الخُصْيَةُ to<br>\
signify [the scrotum, i. e.] the skin containing the<br>\
testicle. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  An earring (قُرْطٌ) in<br>\
the ear: (JK, Sgh, K:) thus called by way of<br>\
comparison: (TA:) pl. خُصًى. (JK.)<br>\
خِصْيَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
خَصِىٌّ Whose testicles have been drawn forth,<br>\
or extracted; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) [gelded, or<br>\
castrated; a eunuch;] applied to a sheep or goat,<br>\
and a horse or similar beast, (TA,) and a man<br>\
(S, TA) or boy, (TA,) or a slave; (Msb;) as<br>\
also ↓ مَخْصِىٌّ: (K:) pl. خِصْيَانٌ (S, Mgh, K)<br>\
and خِصْيَةٌ: (S, K:) in giving it the former pl.,<br>\
they liken it to a subst., like ظَلِيمٌ, of which the<br>\
pl. is ظِلْمَانٌ: so says Sb; meaning that فِعْلَانٌ<br>\
is generally the pl. of فَعِيلٌ as a subst. (TA.)<br>\
One says also خَصِىٌّ نَصِىٌّ; using the latter word<br>\
as an imitative sequent. (Lh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
(tropical:)  Poetry in which is no amatory effusion. (K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
خَاصٍ [act. part. n. of 1]. They say, جَآءَ كَخَاصِى<br>\
العَيْرِ [lit. He came like the gelder of the ass],<br>\
meaning he came ashamed: (JK, and TA in<br>\
art. جوج:) and also, disappointed, or unsuccessful. (TA in that art.)<br>\
مَخْصًى The place of cutting [or gelding or castration]. (S.)<br>\
مَخْصِىٌّ: see خَصِىٌّ.<br>\
