خَشَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
خَشِرَ, (S, K,) inf. n. خَشْرٌ, (S,) He<br>\
picked it, (Lh, S, K,) namely, a collection of<br>\
goods, or commodities, (Lh,) removing from it<br>\
what was bad. (Lh, S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And خَشَرَ, aor.<br>\
(and inf. n., TA) as above, He left upon the table<br>\
refuse of food: thus the verb bears two contr.<br>\
significations. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also خَشَرَهُ He rendered<br>\
it (a thing) bad, or vile. (TA.)<br>\
خُشَارٌ (K) and ↓ خُشَارَةٌ (S, A, K) The bad part<br>\
or parts [or the refuse] (Lh, S, K) of goods, or<br>\
commodities, (Lh,) or of anything. (S, K.) And<br>\
the latter, The worst kind, syn. شِيص, of lates.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  What contains no لُبّ [or heart], of<br>\
barley. (A, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And the latter, The refuse of<br>\
food remaining upon a table; that in which is<br>\
no good. (S, A, K. *) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also the latter, (S, A,<br>\
K,) and the former, (K,) and ↓ خُشَّارٌ, (IAar,)<br>\
(tropical:)  The refuse, or lowest or basest or meanest sort,<br>\
of mankind, or of people; (IAar, S, A, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ خَاشِرٌ, accord. to the K, but correctly ↓ خَاشِرَةٌ,<br>\
as related by AA from IAar. (TA.) El-Hotei-ah<br>\
says,<br>\
وَبَاعَ بَنِيهِ بَعْضُهُمْ بِخُشَارَةً<br>\
وَبِعْتَ لِذُبْيَانَ العَلَآءَ بِمَالِكِ<br>\
[And some of them have sold their sons for the<br>\
refuse of mankind; but] thou hast purchased<br>\
eminence for Dhubyán with Málik: in the S we<br>\
find بِمَالِكَا [with thy property]: but it is correctly<br>\
as above: Málik was a son of &#39;Oyeyneh Ibn-<br>\
Hisn: the Benoo-&#39;Ámir slew him: wherefore<br>\
&#39;Oyeyneh made war upon them, and obtained his<br>\
blood-revenge, and spoil: and to this event El-<br>\
Hotei-ah refers in the verse above. (IB, TA.)<br>\
