خَثُرَ, aor.<br>\
خَثُرَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) a rare dial. var.;<br>\
(Fr, S;) and خَثِرَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
خَثَرَ, (Msb,)<br>\
a form heard by Ks; (S;) inf. n. (of the first,<br>\
TA) خَثْرٌ and خُثُورٌ and خَثَرَانٌ, (K, TA,) which<br>\
last is irregular, because this word does not imply<br>\
motion, (TA,) [but this assertion requires consideration,] and (of the second [accord. to rule],<br>\
TA, or of the first, Msb, [or used as inf. n. of the<br>\
first because it is the most common form,])<br>\
خُثُورَةٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and [of the second<br>\
accord. to rule] خَثَارَةٌ (K) and of the third خَثَرٌ;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) [and probably ↓ تخثّر, (mentioned<br>\
by Freytag, though without any indication of his<br>\
authority,) as quasi-pass. of خَثَّرَهُ; but I have<br>\
more than once found it erroneously written for<br>\
تختّر, which has a different signification;] it<br>\
(milk, S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, and honey, and the<br>\
like, TA, and a liniment or the like, A, or some<br>\
other thing, Msb) was, or became, thick, (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) and strong. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
خَثَرَتْ نَفْسُهُ, (S, K,) or خَثِرَتْ, (A,) or خَثُرَتٌ,<br>\
(Mgh,) inf. n. خُثُورٌ and خَثَارَةٌ, but not, as some<br>\
write it, خُثَارَةٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  His soul [or stomach]<br>\
heaved, became agitated by a tendency to vomit,<br>\
or became heavy; (A, Mgh, K, TA;) as also خَثَرَ<br>\
alone; (IAar, TA;) became disordered; syn.<br>\
اِخْتَلَطَتْ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And خَثَرَ; (S;) or خَثِرَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
خَثَرَ; (K;) or خَثِرَ فِى الحَىِّ; (A;) (tropical:)  He remained among the tribe, (S, A, K,) not going<br>\
forth with people to procure wheat or corn or<br>\
other provisions, (S, K,) by reason of shame, or<br>\
of heaviness of the soul [or stomach]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And خَثِرَ (assumed tropical:)  He felt, or had a sense of, or he was,<br>\

اخثرهُ; (Msb, K;) and ↓ خثّرهُ, (A, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. تَخْثِيرٌ; (TA;) He thickened it; made it<br>\
thick, (Msb, A, K,) and strong; (Msb;) namely,<br>\
milk, (A, Msb, K,) and honey, and the like,<br>\
(TA,) and a liniment or the like, (A,) or some<br>\
other thing. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And the former signifies<br>\
also He left it in a thick state; namely, fresh<br>\
butter; (As, S, K;) not melting it. (As, S.) It<br>\
is said in a prov., مَا يَدْرِى أَيُخْثِرُ أَمْ يُذِيبُ [He<br>\
knows not whether to leave in a thick state or to<br>\
melt]: (S K; in one copy of the former of which,<br>\
the fem. forms of the verbs are used:) applied to<br>\
him who is confounded, or perplexed, and unable<br>\
to see his right course, and who wavers, or vacillates: its origin being this: a woman melts fresh<br>\
butter, and what is thick thereof becomes mixed<br>\
with what is thin, and she is vexed and wearied<br>\
by her case, and knows not whether to raise the<br>\
fire with fuel, in order that it may become clear;<br>\
fearing that, if she do so, it will burn: thus she<br>\
is perplexed. (K.)<br>\
