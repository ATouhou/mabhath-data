(JK:) so, too, the former verb is used in speaking of the mirage; (S, K;) and ↓ the latter verb<br>\

makes the ف of [the inf. n.] الخَفْق to be with<br>\

مُشْتَبِهِ الأَعْلَامِ لَمَّاعِ الخَفَقْ<br>\

trad., (Mgh,) He bent [down] his head, without<br>\
the rest of his body, [or nodded,] once, or twice,<br>\

أَوْ خَفْقَتَيْنِ ↓ تَخْفِقُ خَفْقَةً [Their heads used to<br>\
nod by reason of drowsiness, or dozing, once or<br>\

K:) or, as some say, shone with a flickering light,<br>\
or glistened, or shone brightly: [because of their<br>\

the ا in the verb had a privative effect. (TA.)<br>\
One says, وَرَدْتُ خُفُوقَ النَّجْمِ, meaning [I came]<br>\
at the time of the setting of the Pleiades; making<br>\
the inf. n. an adv. n. [of time]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\

same word as signifying “ the act of striking [or<br>\
slapping],” (TA,) الخَفْقُ signifies The act of<br>\
inserting; (Mgh;) [i. e.] the causing the penis<br>\

p. 26:) because he becomes in a shaky, or unsteady, condition, at that time: or because his<br>\
travelling-bags become unsteady, or shake about,<br>\
by reason of their lightness and emptiness: so<br>\
that the verb is of the same category as أَعْطَشَ<br>\
[meaning “ his camels thirsted ”] and أَجْرَبَ<br>\
[meaning “ he had his camels affected with the<br>\
mange, or scab]: (Har ubi suprà:) or the proper<br>\
signification is, he found the spoil to be not<br>\
stationary: (TA:) or it means he returned disappointed of spoil, or of predatory warfare:<br>\
(JK:) or he was disappointed of that for which<br>\
he hoped. (Ham p. 157.) And He (a hunter or<br>\
fowler) returned without having taken any game.<br>\

You say also, اخفق فِى زَادِهِ He (a man) had his<br>\
