(K, TA,) like اِرْعَوَى: (TA:) or خِزْىٌ signifies<br>\
disgrace, or ignominy: so in the Kur v. 37<br>\
[&amp;c.]: (Sh, TA:) or its primary signification is<br>\

which one is ashamed: so accord. to Er-Rághib<br>\
and Bd and the Ksh: (MF, TA:) or the manifesting foul actions or qualities, for the manifesting of which one deserves punishment: (El-<br>\
Harállee, TA:) or خَزِىَ signifies he became disgraced, and was confounded, or perplexed, by<br>\
reason of disgrace. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And خَزِىَ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) aor. as above, (S, Mgh,) inf. n. خَزَايَةٌ<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K) and خَزًى, (K,) He was, or<br>\

(TK.) You say, ↓ خَازَانِى فَخَزَيْتُهُ, (Ks, JK, S,<br>\
K,) aor. of the latter أَخْزِيهِ, (Ks, JK, S,) [inf. n.<br>\
app. خَزْىٌ,] I vied, or contended, with him (JK,<br>\
TK) in mutual abasing, &amp;c., (TK,) and I surpassed, or overcame, him [therein]: (JK:) [or<br>\
it may signify, in abasement, &amp;c.; for] the meaning [of the latter verb with its pronoun] is كُنْتُ<br>\
أَشَدَّ خَزْيًا مِنْهُ. (K: in the CK, خِزْيًا: but in a<br>\
MS copy of the K, خِزْيًا.)<br>\

or may He abase him; &amp;c.: (S, Msb:) or He<br>\
disgraced him, or put him to shame: or may He<br>\

[xi. 80], the saying of Lot to his people, وَلَا<br>\
تُخْزُونِ فِى ضَيْفِى (TA) And disgrace ye not me<br>\
in respect of my guests: (Bd, Jel, TA:) or make<br>\
not me ashamed &amp;c. (Bd.) One says also, of<br>\
him who has done or said that which is approved,<br>\
مَالَهُ أخْزَاهُ اللّٰهُ [What aileth him? May God<br>\
abase him, or disgrace him!]; and so without<br>\
ما له: (K:) it is like مَا لَهُ قَاتَلَهُ اللّٰهُ, said of a<br>\
man whose action pleases: (S in art. نفر:) it is<br>\
used in lieu of praise, to charm a person against<br>\
the evil eye; and means a prayer for him, not an<br>\
imprecation against him. (TA.) See also مُخْزٍ,<br>\
below. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He made him to be ashamed for<br>\
himself (Ham pp. 114 and 397, and TA) in<br>\
respect of him, for his shortcoming. (TA.) [See<br>\

which is coupled therewith in the JK, app. as<br>\
syn. with it, properly signifies a thing, or an<br>\
action, &amp;c., that is a cause of shame, or of abasement or disgrace; being a noun of the class of<br>\
مَبْخَلَةٌ and مَجْبَنَةٌ; originally مَخْزَيَةٌ: see 4, last<br>\

part. n., from أَخْزَى, signifies [the same; or] a<br>\
bad, an evil, or a foul, habit, quality, practice,<br>\
or action: the pl. of this last is مُخْزِيَاتٌ, and of<br>\
the same [and of مَخْزَاةٌ also] مَخَازٍ. (Msb.) Or<br>\
the first signifies A habit, a practice, or an<br>\
action, in which one becomes base, despicable, or<br>\
ignominious. (Mgh.) ―<br>\

خَزْيَانُ Moved, or affected, with shame; (S,<br>\
Msb, K, and Ham p. 36;) as also ↓ مُسْتَخْزٍ:<br>\
(Har p. 482:) or, with much shame, (Lth, JK,<br>\
TA,) on account of a bad, or foul, deed that<br>\
he has done: (Lth, TA:) or it may signify [like<br>\
خَزٍ] base, abased, abject, vile, despicable, or ignominious: (Ham ubi suprà:) fem. خَزْيَا (Lth, JK,<br>\
S, K) and خَزْيَانَةٌ, which is irreg.: (TA:) pl.<br>\
خَزَايَا. (Lth, JK, S, K.)<br>\
مُخْزًى Rendered base, abject, vile, despicable,<br>\
or ignominious, by a thing proved against him.<br>\
(TA.) [See also خَزٍ and خَزْيَانُ.]<br>\
كَلَامٌ مُخْزٍ Speech, or language, that is approved, so that one says of its author, أَخْزَاهُ اللّٰهُ.<br>\
(TA.) They relate that El-Farezdak gave utterance to an excellent verse, and said, هٰذَا بَيْتٌ<br>\
مُخْزِىَّ, i. e. [This is a verse such as that,] when<br>\
it is recited, people will say, [or rather, such as<br>\
will make it to be said of me,] اللّٰهُ قَائِلَهُ مَا ↓ أَخْزَى<br>\
أَشْعَرَهُ [May God abase, or disgrace, the sayer<br>\
thereof! How good, or excellent, a poet is he!].<br>\

ode] that is extremely good. (TA.)<br>\
