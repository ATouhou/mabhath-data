خَلَا, (S, Msb, K,) aor. يَخْلُو, (S, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. خُلُوٌّ, (S, Msb, K,) or خَلَآءٌ, (Msb,) or<br>\
both, (K,) said of a place, (K,) of a place of<br>\
alighting or abode, (Msb,) and of a thing, (S,<br>\
TA,) It was, or became, empty, vacant, void,<br>\
devoid, destitute, or unoccupied; (K, TA;) had<br>\
none, and nothing, in it; (TA;) as also ↓ اخلى,<br>\
(Msb, K,) and ↓ استخلى, (K.) [خَلَا المَكَانُ مِنَ<br>\
النَّاسُ وَ المَآءِ وَالكَلَأ means The place was, or<br>\
became, devoid, or destitute, of human beings and<br>\
water and herbage or pasturage; without human<br>\
beings &amp;c.] Of a place of alighting or abode, you<br>\
say, خَلَا مِنْ أَهْلِهِ and ↓ اخلى [It was, or became,<br>\
devoid, or destitute, of its occupants]. (Msb.)<br>\
And of a vessel, خَلَا مِمَّا فِيهِ It was, or became,<br>\
empty of what was in it. (Mgh.) And خَلَوْتُ<br>\
عَنِ الطَّعَامِ (S) I became empty, in the belly, of<br>\
food; (PS;) and عَنْهُ ↓ أَخْلَيْتُ signifies the<br>\
same. (S.) And خَلَا مِن العَيْبِ, (Msb,) or عَنِ<br>\
الأَمْرِ, and مِنْهُ, (Kudot;,) inf. n. خُلُوٌّ, He was, or<br>\
became, free (Msb, K) from fault, (Msb,) or<br>\
from the thing, or affair: (K:) and, accord. to<br>\
IAar, خلا alone signifies he was, or became, free<br>\
from a fault, or the like, of which he was<br>\
accused, or suspected. (TA.) And خَلَتْ عَنْ مَانِعِ<br>\
النِّكَاحِ, inf. n. خُلُوٌّ, is said of a woman [as meaning She was, or became, free from any obstacle to<br>\
marriage]. (Msb.) Accord. to the K, خَلَا مَكَانُهُ<br>\
[lit. His place became vacant] means (tropical:)  he died:<br>\
but accord. to IAar, خَلَا alone has this signification [from the same verb signifying مَضَى. explained below]: and if you add مكانه, you say<br>\
خَلَّى, with teshdeed; which see below. (TA.)<br>\
You say also, خَلَا لَكَ الشَّىْءُ and ↓ اخلى, both<br>\
signifying the same, (AA, S, TA,) i. q. فَرَغَ [i. e.<br>\
The thing was, or became, vacant, or unoccupied,<br>\
for thee: (see an ex. of the former verb in a<br>\
saying of Tarafeh cited voce جَوٌّ:) and hence, the<br>\
thing was, or became, exclusively for thee].<br>\
(TA.) AA cites as an ex. the saying of Maan<br>\
Ibn-Ows,<br>\
أَعَاذِلُ هَلْ يَأْتِى القَبَائِلَ حَظُّهَا<br>\
لَنا المَوْتُ وَحْدَنَا ↓ مِنَ المَوْتِ أَمْ أَخْلَى<br>\
[O censurer, does their share of death come to the<br>\
tribes in common, or is death exclusively for us<br>\
alone?]. (S, TA.) See also the paragraph,<br>\
below, commencing with خَلَا as a word denoting<br>\
exception. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] خَلَا and ↓ اخلى, (S, K,)<br>\
said of a man, (TA,) or the same two verbs followed by بِنَفْسِهِ, said of a man, (Msb,) both<br>\
signify the same; (S;) He was, or became,<br>\
[without any companion, i. e.] alone, by himself;<br>\
(Msb;) or he became (وَقَعَ [q. v.]) in a vacant<br>\
place, in which he was not pressed against, or<br>\
straitened. (K.) And خَلَا بِهِ, (S, Msb, K,) and<br>\
إِلَيْهِ, (S, K,) and مَعَهُ, (K,) inf. n. خَلْوَةٌ (S, Msb,<br>\
K) and خَلَآءٌ (S, K) and خَلْوٌ, (K, TA,) or خُلُوٌّ,<br>\
(CK,) or the first of these, i. e. خَلْوَةٌ, is a simple<br>\
subst., and the second and third are the inf. ns.;<br>\
(TA;) and به ↓ اخلى, (Lh, K,) and ↓ اخلاهُ, (S,<br>\
K,) and بِهِ ↓ استخلى; (K; [the last omitted in<br>\
the CK;]) He was, or became, alone with him;<br>\
(Msb;) he was, or became, in company with him,<br>\
or he met him, or had a meeting or an interview<br>\
with him, in a vacant place, or a place unoccupied [by others, i. e., in a private place]. (S, K.)<br>\
In the saying in the Kur [ii. 13], وَإِذَا خَلَوْا إِلَى<br>\
شَيَاطِينِهِمْ, it is said that إِلَى is used in the sense<br>\
of مَعَ, [so that the meaning is And when they are<br>\
alone with their devils,] as in that other saying in<br>\
the Kur [iii. 45 and lxi. 14], مَنْ أَنْصَارِى إِلَى اللّٰهُ.<br>\
(S.) A man says to another man, اُخْلُ مَعِى حَتَّى<br>\
أُكَلِّمَكَ, i. e. Be [or come] thou alone with me<br>\
[that I may speak to thee in private]. (TA.)<br>\
And one says, خَلَا بِزَوْجَتِهِ, inf. n. خَلْوَةٌ, [but see<br>\
what is said of this noun above,] He was, or became, alone with his wife: but [properly speaking,<br>\
according to the law,] the term خَلْوَةٌ [or خَلْوَةٌ<br>\
صَحِيحَةٌ, in this case,] is not used unless it be with<br>\
the enjoyment of المُفَاخَذَة, [see 3 in art. فخذ,]<br>\
and then it has an effect upon the circumstances<br>\
of the marriage [by its rendering obligatory the<br>\
payment of the dowry, though consummation has<br>\
not taken place]: if with consummation, the act<br>\
is termed دُخُولٌ. (Msb.) You say also, ↓ أَخْلِ<br>\
أَمْرَكَ and بِأَمْرِكَ Be thou alone in thine affair,<br>\
with none to take part with thee in it; confine<br>\
thyself to it exclusively of other things. (TA.<br>\
[See also 5.]) And إِلَيْكَ ↓ أَخْلِ Keep thou to thine<br>\
affair, and be alone in it, with none to take part<br>\
with thee therein. (JK.) And البُكَآءُ ↓ استخلى<br>\
[app. for بِالبُكَآءِ] He was, or became, alone in<br>\
weeping, with none to participate with him in it.<br>\
(TA.) [And خَلَا لِلْأَمْرِ: see 5.] And خَلَاعَلَى<br>\
بَعْضِ الطَّعَامِ He restricted himself to a portion<br>\
of the food. (K.) Temeem say, خَلَا فُلَانٌ عَلَى<br>\
اللَّبَنِ وَ اللَّحْمِ (JK, * TA) i. e. Such a one fed<br>\
upon milk and flesh-meat alone; (JK;) or such<br>\
a one ate not, nor mixed, anything with milk and<br>\
flesh-meat: and Kináneh and Keys say ↓ أَخْلَى.<br>\
(Lh, JK, * TA.) [And it seems to be indicated<br>\
in the T that خَلَوْا signifies They selected a she-camel for a خَلِيَّة, q. v.: or i. q. تَخَلَّوْا بِخَلَيِّةٍ:<br>\
see 5.] ―<br>\
-b3-  خَلَا also ssignifies He devoted himself<br>\
to religious services or exercises [app. in solitude,<br>\
or seclusion, or in a خَلْوَة; or because one generally does so in solitude; or because the doing so<br>\
involves abstraction from other affairs]. (TA.<br>\
[See also 5; and see مُسْتَخْلٍ.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  And خَلَا بِهِ<br>\
[sometimes] signifies (tropical:)  He mocked at, scoffed at,<br>\
laughed at, derided, or ridiculed, him: (Lh, S,<br>\
Z, K, TA:) said by Az to be strange, and not<br>\
known by him or any other authority than that<br>\
of Lh: (TA:) from the saying, خَلَا فُلَانٌ بِعِرْضِ<br>\
فُلَانٍ يَعْبَثُ بِهِ [Such a one occupied himself alone<br>\
with the honour, or reputation, of such a one,<br>\
making sport with it]. (Ksh in ii. 13.) And<br>\
i. q. خَادَعَهُ (tropical:)  [He deceived, deluded, beguiled,<br>\
circumvented, or outwitted, him; &amp;c.: or he<br>\
strove to do so]: (TA:) as also ↓ خالاهُ, (JK, and<br>\
K in art. خلى,) inf. n. مُخَالَاةٌ. (JK.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
خَلَا عَلَيْهِ He relied upon him; [as though he<br>\
betook himself to him alone;] syn. اِعْتَمَدَ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  And خَلَا, (JK, K,) inf. n. خُلُوٌّ, (TA,) or<br>\
خَلَآءٌ, (JK,) said of a man (JK) and of a thing,<br>\
(JK, TA,) He, or it, went, went away, or passed<br>\
away. (JK, K.) Hence, (TA,) وَ إِنْ مِنْ أُمَّةٍإِلَّا<br>\
خَلَا فِيهَا نَذِيرٌ, in the Kur [xxxv. 22], means<br>\
[And there is not any people but a warner] hath<br>\
gone, and hath been sent, among them. (S, TA.)<br>\
[Hence also خَلَا explained above as meaning He<br>\
died.] And خَلَا مِنْهَا [an elliptical phrase] She<br>\
became old; the greater part of her life passed.<br>\
(TA from a trad.) And خَلَاكَ ذَمٌّ [for خَلَا عَنْكَ<br>\
ذَمٌّ] Blame passed away from thee; or may blame<br>\
pass away from thee. (Ksh and Bd in ii. 13.)<br>\
You say, اِفْعَلْ كَذَا وَ خَلَاكَ ذَمٌّ Do thou such a<br>\
thing, and thou wilt have an excuse; [i. e.] blame<br>\
will fall from thee. (S. [See art. ذم.]) And<br>\
خَلَاهُ الحُزْنُ Grief passed away from him, and<br>\
quitted him. (Har p. 590, from the Tekmileh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  خَلَا عَنِ الشَّىْءِ: see 2.<br>\
-A2-  خَلَا [or خَلَى, probably belonging to art. خلى, though mentioned<br>\
in the present art.,] He ate what was good, sweet,<br>\
or pleasant. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
خَلَّى, inf. n. تَخْلِيَةٌ, [He left a place, &amp;c.,<br>\
empty, vacant, void, devoid, destitute, or unoccupied.] Hence, خلّى مَكَانَهُ [He left his place<br>\
vacant;] meaning (tropical:)  he died: (TA, and so in Ham<br>\
p. 478:) a meaning assigned in the K to ↓ خَلَا<br>\
مَكَانُهُ, and by IAar to خَلَا alone, without tesh-deed; but when مكانه is added, it is with teshdeed.<br>\
(TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  He went his way. (Ham p. 379.)<br>\
And خلّى سَبِيلَهُ [He left his way free, or open,<br>\
to him]. (S, TA.) And خلّى بَيْنَهُمَا [He left the<br>\
way, or space, free between them two; meaning<br>\
he left them two free, each to do to the other as<br>\
he pleased]. (TA.) [And خلّى بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ كَذَا<br>\
He left him free access to such a thing.] And<br>\
خلّى بَيْنَهُ وَ بَيْنَ نَفْسِهِ He left him, or it, alone;<br>\
syn. أَهْمَلَهُ. (S and O and K in art. همل.) [And<br>\
خلّاهُ وَفُلَانًا He left him to do as he pleased with<br>\
such a one.] And خلّى الأَمْرَ He left, left alone,<br>\
or let alone, the thing, or affair; as also ↓ تخلّى<br>\
مِنْهُ and عَنْهُ; and ↓ خالاهُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. خِلَآءٌ.<br>\
(TA.) For تَخْلِيَةٌ signifies The leaving, and<br>\
making a thing to be alone. (Har p. 123.)<br>\
[خلّاهُ and خلّى عَنْهُ both signify He left, or left<br>\
alone, it, or him.] It is said in a trad., خلّى عَنْهُمْ<br>\
أَرْبَعِينَ عَامًا He (God) left them, or left them<br>\
alone, and turned from them, forty years. (TA.)<br>\
[And خلّاهُ لِكَذَا He made him, or left him, vacant, unoccupied, unemployed, or at leisure, for<br>\
such a thing.] ―<br>\
-b2-  تَخْلِيَةٌ also signifies The act of<br>\
loosing; contr. of شَدٌّ. (IAar, K in art. ابض.)<br>\
[Hence,] خلّى عَنِ الشَّىْءِ, (JK, S, * TA,) in the<br>\
K ↓ خَلَا, without teshdeed, but this requires consideration, (TA,) He dismissed, loosed, let loose,<br>\
or let go, the thing. (JK, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And<br>\
hence خلّاهُ meaning He left it, permitted it, or<br>\
allowed it: see the pass. part. n., below.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
خُلِّيَتْ, said of a she-camel such as is termed<br>\
خَلِيَّة; and hence, of a cooking-pot: see 1 in art.<br>\
خلى.<br>\
3<br>\
خالاهُ He left, forsook, relinquished, abandoned, deserted, or quitted, him, being left, &amp;c.,<br>\
by him; namely, another man; syn. تَارَكَهُ; (S;)<br>\
inf. n. مُخَالَاةٌ, syn. with مُوَادَعَةٌ, (JK,) [and<br>\
خِلَآءٌ also: and he was, or became, distant, remote, far off, aloof, or apart, from him; for]<br>\
خِلَآءٌ is syn. with مُبَاعَدَةٌ and مُجَانَبَةٌ (TA in art.<br>\
خلأ) and فُرْقَةٌ. (TA in the present art.) And<br>\
خالى الأَمْرَ, inf. n. خِلَآءٌ: see 2. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also He<br>\
went, or came, out, or forth, to him, in the field;<br>\
for] مُخَالَاةٌ is also syn. with مُبَارَزَةٌ. (Sh, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (Lth, JK, K,) inf. n. مُخَالَاةٌ, (Lth,<br>\
JK,) He wrestled with him, each endeavouring<br>\
to throw down the other; contended with him in<br>\
wrestling: (Lth, JK, K: mentioned in the K in<br>\
art. خلى:) because, when one does so, he is<br>\
alone with the other, so that neither of them seeks<br>\
aid from any other. (Az, TA.) And in like<br>\
manner the word مُخَالَاةٌ is used [app. as meaning<br>\
The act of contending with another, by oneself,]<br>\
in relation to any affair, or case. (Lth, JK, TA.<br>\
[See its act. part. n., below.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 1, in<br>\
the latter part of the paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
أَخْلَوَ see 1, in eleven places.<br>\
-A2-  اخلى المَكَانَ,<br>\
(S, K,) or المَنْزِلَ, (Msb,) He made the place,<br>\
(K,) or the place of alighting or abode, (Msb,)<br>\
empty, vacant, void, devoid, destitute, or unoccupied: (Msb, K:) or it signifies, (S, K,) or<br>\
signifies also, (Msb,) he found it empty, &amp;c. (S,<br>\
Msb, K.) One says in praying for another that<br>\
he may have a long life, لَا أَخْلَى اللّٰهُ مَكَانَكَ [May<br>\
God not make thy place vacant]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
اخلاهُ مَعَهُ [He made him, or found him, to be<br>\
alone with him]. (K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تخلّى He went forth into the field, or open<br>\
country, to satisfy a want of nature. (TA.)<br>\
And تخلّى فِى الخَلَآءِ He went forth into the<br>\
vacant tract, or into the privy, to satisfy a want<br>\
of nature: or he satisfied a want of nature<br>\
therein. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He was, or became, or<br>\
made himself, vacant from occupation, or business; [unoccupied; unemployed; or at leisure;]<br>\
syn. تَفَرَّغَ: (S:) or so تخلّى مِنَ الشُّغْلِ. (K in<br>\
art. فرغ.) You say, تخلّى لِلْعِبَادَةِ He was, or<br>\
became, or made himself, vacant for, or he confined himself exclusively to, the service of God.<br>\
(TA.) [See also 1, in the latter part of the paragraph. In like manner, one says also, لِلْأَمْرِ ↓ خَلَا<br>\
He was, or became, or made himself, vacant for,<br>\
or he confined himself exclusively to, the affair.]<br>\
And تَخَلَّوْا بِخَلِيَّةٍ (S, K, TA) They confined<br>\
themselves exclusively to a she-camel, or to she-camels, such as they termed خلية, (K, TA,)<br>\
يَحْلُبُونَهَا [milking only her, or them]. (S, TA.)<br>\
And تخلّى خَلِيَّةً He took for himself a خليّة.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And تخلّى مِنَ الأَمْرِ and عَنْهُ: see 2.<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And تَخَلَّتِ الإِبِلُ بِلَا رَاعٍ [The camels were<br>\
left to themselves without a pastor]. (K in art.<br>\
سوع.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَخْلَوَ see 1, in three places. [And see also<br>\
مُسْتَخْلٍ.]<br>\
-A2-  استخلاهُ مَجْلِسَهُ He asked him to<br>\
leave his sitting-place vacant, or unoccupied, for<br>\
him. (S. [But found by me in only one copy of<br>\
that work.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  استخلى المَلِكَ He asked the<br>\
king to have a meeting, or an interview, with him<br>\
in a vacant place, or a place unoccupied [by<br>\
others, i. e., in a private place; he asked the<br>\
king to grant him a private meeting or interview]. (K.)<br>\
خَلَا as a word denoting exception, (S, Mughnee,<br>\
K,) when it governs a gen. case, (S, Mughnee,)<br>\
as when you say, جَاؤُونِى خَلَا زَيْدٍ [They came to<br>\
me, except Zeyd], is a particle, (S, Mughnee, K,)<br>\
accord. to some of the grammarians, like حَاشَى;<br>\
but accord. to some, a prefixed inf. n. (S.) ↓ It.<br>\
also governs an accus. case, as a verb: (S, Mughnee:) so that you say, جَاؤُونِى خَلَا زَيْدًا [meaning<br>\
as above]; the agent of خلا being implied, (S,<br>\
Mughnee, *) like that of حَاشَى [used as a verb]:<br>\
it is as though you said, خَلَا مَنْ جَآءَنِى مِنْ زَيْدٍ<br>\
[i. e. those who came to me were without Zeyd]:<br>\
(S:) or correctly, accord. to IB, خَلَا بَعْضُهُمْ زَيْدًا<br>\
[for مِنْ زَيْدٍ, like as you say, خَلَاكَ ذَمٌّ, for خَلَا<br>\
عَنْكَ ذَمٌّ]. (TA.) When you say مَا خَلَا, it is<br>\
followed only by an accus., because ما خلا is equivalent to an inf. n.; (S, Mughnee;) so that when<br>\
you say, جَاؤُونِى مَا خَلَا زَيْدًا [meaning as above],<br>\
it is as if you said, جَاؤُونِى خُلُوَّ زَيْدٍ [or خُلُوًّا<br>\
زَيْدًا], i. e. خُلُوَّهُمْ مِنْ زَيْدٍ, (S,) which two phrases<br>\
mean جَاؤُونِى خَالِينَ مِنْ زَيْدٍ [They came to me,<br>\
they being without Zeyd]: (S, K:) [for] accord.<br>\
to Seer, ماخلا occupies the place of a noun in the<br>\
accus. as a denotative of state: but some say,<br>\
as an adv. n. of time; so that, accord. to these,<br>\
مَا خَلَا زَيْدًا means وَقْتَ خُلُوِّهِمْ عَنْ زَيْدٍ [in the<br>\
time of their being without Zeyd]. (Mughnee.)<br>\
You say also, مَا أَرَدْتُ مَسَآءَتَكَ خَلَا أَنِّى وَعَظْتُكَ,<br>\
meaning [I desired not to displease thee,] but I<br>\
admonished thee (إِلَّا أَنِّى وَعَظْتُكَ). (JK, TA.)<br>\
خِلْوٌ, and its fem. (with ة), and dual: see خَالٍ,<br>\
in seven places.<br>\
خَلْوَةٌ said by some to be an inf. n.: [see خَلَا بِهِ<br>\
&amp;c. in the first paragraph of this art.:] by others said<br>\
to be a simple subst.; (TA;) meaning Loneliness;<br>\
solitude; lonesomeness; solitariness; desolateness;<br>\
syn. وَحْشَةٌ. (S and K in art. وحش.) [Hence, app.,]<br>\
رَجُلٌ سَهْلُ الخَلْوَةِ [A man easy in private conference]. (Msb in art. سلس. [See also a phrase in<br>\
the latter part of the next paragraph.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also An empty, a vacant, a void, or an unoccupied, place. (KL. [See also خَلَآءٌ.]) [In the<br>\
present day, it is often applied to A closet to which<br>\
one retires for privacy; and particularly to a cell<br>\
for religious retirement: and is vulgarly pronounced خِلْوَة.] You say, اِجْتَمَعَ مَعَهُ فِى خَلْوَةٍ<br>\
(S) or اجتمع بِهِ فى خلوة (K) [He had a meeting,<br>\
or an interview, with him in a vacant place, or<br>\
a place unoccupied by others, i. e., in a private<br>\
place].<br>\
-A2-  Also Each of the two sharp sides or<br>\
edges of an arrow-head (AHn, JK, TA) or of a<br>\
spear-head: (AHn, TA:) both together are called<br>\
the خَلْوَتَانِ: (AHn, JK, TA.)<br>\
خَلَآءٌ is primarily an inf. n. (MF, TA. [See 1,<br>\
first sentence.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Then it is used as an epithet,<br>\
syn. with خَالٍ:] see خَالٍ, in five places. ―<br>\
-b3-  Then<br>\
it is used [as a subst.] in the sense of A vacant<br>\
place [in a general sense]: (MF, TA:) or a<br>\
place in which is nothing: (S, K:) [often applied<br>\
in the present day to any open tract of country<br>\
or desert:] and then, particularly, such as one<br>\
takes for the purpose of satisfying a want of<br>\
nature; (MF, TA;) i. q. مُتَوَضَّأٌ, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
but not as meaning only a place for the performance of الوُضُوء, as might be imagined from this<br>\
explanation: pl. أَخْلِيَةٌ. (MF, TA.) It is said in<br>\
a prov., (S, Meyd,) خَلَاؤُكَ أَقْنَى لِحَيَائِكَ, (S,<br>\
Meyd, K,) [in Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov., (i. 436,)<br>\
بِحَيَآيِكَ,] i. e. [Thy place of retirement is] most<br>\
preservative (أَلْزَمُ) [of thy sense of shame, or<br>\
modesty]; meaning it is most fit for thee to be<br>\
alone in thine abode; (S, * Meyd;) for he who<br>\
is so needs not to be careful for his shame, or<br>\
modesty: it is used in blaming the mixing with<br>\
others. (Meyd.) حُصِرَ عَلَيْهِ خَلَاؤُهُ [His place of<br>\
retirement for satisfying a want of nature was<br>\
straitened to him] is used as meaning he suffered<br>\
suppression of the feces, or constipation of the<br>\
bowels. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA in art. حصر.)<br>\
-A2-  إِنَّهُ<br>\
لَحْلُو الخَلَآءِ, (TA,) or [as written in a verse in<br>\
which it occurs in the TA in the present art., and<br>\
in art. خلى,] الخَلَا, (JK, TA,) [without ء, but<br>\
whether this be the right reading, or only required by poetic license, seems to be doubtful,]<br>\
is a phrase mentioned by Th, (TA,) meaning<br>\
Verily he is good in speech. (JK, TA. [If the<br>\
former reading be right, the meaning may be<br>\
similar to that of سَهْلُ الخَلْوَةِ, mentioned above:<br>\
if the latter only, or rather انّه لحلو الخَلَى, be<br>\
right, it probably belongs to art. خلىٍ, and is<br>\
tropical, from the herbage termed خَلى; and this<br>\
may also be the case if the former reading be<br>\
right.])<br>\
خَلِىٌّ; and its fem. خَلِيَّةٌ: see خَالٍ, in twelve<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  The fem. also signifies, applied to a<br>\
she-camel, (S, Msb,) Loosed from the cord, or<br>\
rope, with which her fore shank and her arm<br>\
have been bound together, (S, Msb, K,) and left<br>\
alone, or free, (S,) so that she pastures where she<br>\
will. (Msb.) Hence, (Msb,) it is used by way<br>\
of metonymy as meaning Divorced: (Lh, S,<br>\
Msb, K:) one says to a woman, أَنْتِ خَلِيَّةٌ Thou<br>\
art divorced; (Lh, S;) and thus a man used to<br>\
say in the Time of Ignorance: (TA:) and one<br>\
says, هِىَ خَلِيَّةٌ She is divorced: (Msb:) and a<br>\
woman is divorced thereby when divorce is meant.<br>\
(Lh, TA.) Applied to a woman, it signifies also<br>\
Free from any obstacle to marriage: pl. خَلِيَّاتٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A she-camel that is made to<br>\
affect, with another she-camel, one young one, so<br>\
that both yield their milk to it, and to which the<br>\
people of a tent, or house, confine themselves exclusively of the other for the purpose of milking<br>\
her: (S:) or a she-camel that is chosen as the<br>\
one more abundant in milk, when one has brought<br>\
forth and her young one is drawn away (يُجَرُّ)<br>\
as soon as born, before she smells it, and the<br>\
young one of another, that has brought forth<br>\
before her, is brought near to her, and she affects<br>\
it; the other is left to suckle the young one, and<br>\
is termed بَسُوطٌ, pl. بسط [app. بُسْطٌ or بُسُطٌ]:<br>\
(Az, TA:) or a she-camel that is left, or left<br>\
alone, to be milked: (K:) or that affects a young<br>\
one [not her own], or is destitute of her young<br>\
one, (JK, M, K,) whether she incline to another&#39;s<br>\
young one or do not, or that is destitute of her<br>\
young one by death or slaughter, (M, TA,) and<br>\
whose milk one causes to flow by means of the<br>\
young one of another; but only by her affecting<br>\
a young one, and not suckling it: (M, K: *) or<br>\
that brings forth, when abundant in milk, and<br>\
has her young one drawn (يُجَرُّ) from beneath<br>\
her, and another put beneath her, and is then<br>\
left, or left alone, to be milked; (Lh, K;) this<br>\
being done because of her generous quality:<br>\
(Lh:) or a she-camel, or two she-camels, to<br>\
which the people of a tent, or house, confine themselves exclusively, for milking, when two or three<br>\
she-camels are made to affect one young one, and<br>\
to yield their milk to it; the young one [afterwards] sucking from one of them only: (K, *<br>\
TA:) or a she-camel that brings forth, and whose<br>\
young one is drawn away (يُجَرُّ) in order that<br>\
her milk may continue for their use, she being<br>\
made to yield her milk by means of the young one<br>\
of another, which is then withdrawn from her,<br>\
and she is milked: sometimes, also, they bring<br>\
together three and four خَلَايَا [pl. of خَلِيَّةٌ] to one<br>\
young camel: and the doing so is termed تَلَسُّنٌ:<br>\
(IAar, TA:) in this case they take as a خليّة<br>\
whichever of them they will. (ISh, TA.) [Applied to a she-camel in any of these senses, it<br>\
seems to be an epithet in which the quality of a<br>\
subst. is predominant; i. e., used without its<br>\
having نَاقَةٌ prefixed to it.]<br>\
-A2-  See also the paragraph next following, in two places.<br>\
