خَصَّهُ بِالشَّىْءِ, (S, K,) or بِكَذَا, (A, Msb,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
خَصُ3َ, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. خَصٌّ (K) and خُصُوصٌ<br>\
(S, Msb, K) and خَصُوصٌ (TA) and خَصُوصِيَّةٌ<br>\
and خُصُوصِيَّةٌ, (S, Mgh, * Msb, K,) of which last<br>\
two the former is the more chaste, (S, TA,) and<br>\
is the form mentioned in the Fs and its Exposi<br>\
tions, and the ى in it is said to be the relative<br>\
ى, and the ى which is characteristic of an inf. n.,<br>\
whereas in the latter it is said to be a characteristic<br>\
of intensiveness, but MF thinks that this requires<br>\
consideration, because the ى is also said to be,<br>\
and by some more commonly, without teshdeed,<br>\
as in كَرَاهِيَةٌ and عَلَانِيَةٌ, (TA,) and خِصِّيصَى, (S,<br>\
K,) like مِكِّيثَى, which is said to be the only other<br>\
instance of this measure, (TA,) [but some others<br>\
might be added, as دِلِّيلَى and فِخِّيرَى and قِتِّيتَى,]<br>\
and خِصِّيصَآءُ, (IAar, Kr, K,) [like مِكِّيثَآءُ,] the<br>\
former of which last two [each of which has an<br>\
intensive signification] is the chaste, and com<br>\
monly known, form, (TA,) and خُصِّيَّةٌ, or خِصِّيَّةٌ,<br>\
or خَصِيَّةٌ, (accord. to different copies of the K,)<br>\
written by Sgh with damm, (TA,) and تَخِصَّةٌ,<br>\
(Ibn-&#39; Abbád, K,) or, as some say, خَصُوصِيَّةٌ and<br>\
خِصِّيَّةٌ [or خُصِّيَّةٌ or خَصِّيَّةٌ] are each a quasi-inf. n.,<br>\
as also خَاصَّةٌ, (TA,) He distinguished him particularly, peculiarly, or specially, i. e., above, or<br>\
from, or exclusively of, others, by the thing, or<br>\
by such a thing; he particularized him, or particularly or peculiarly or specially characterized<br>\
him, thereby; syn. فَضَّلَهُ (A, K, TA) دُونَ غَيْرِهِ,<br>\
and مَيَّزَهُ; (TA;) he appropriated, or assigned,<br>\
[the thing or] such a thing, or made it to belong,<br>\
to him alone, or in particular, or peculiarly, or<br>\
specially, exclusively of others; (Msb;) and<br>\
بِهِ ↓ اختصّهُ signifies the same; (S, A, Msb, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ اخصّهُ, (A, [but for this I know not any<br>\
other authority,]) and ↓ خصّصهُ; (A;) or this last<br>\
has an intensive signification. (Msb.) You say,<br>\
خَصَّهُ بِالُودِّ He distinguished him &amp;c. by love, or<br>\
affection; or favoured him in preference to<br>\
another, or others, thereby. (K, TA.) As to the<br>\
saying of AZ,<br>\
إِنِ امْرَأٌ خَصَّنِى عَمْدًا مَوَدَّتَهُ<br>\
عَلَى التَّنَانِى لَعِنْدِى غَيْرُ مَكْفُورِ<br>\
[If a man distinguish me above, or from, or exclusively of, others, purposely, by his love, or because of his love of me, notwithstanding distance<br>\
of each from the other, it will not be disacknowledged with me,] the meaning is, خَصَّنِى بِمَوَدَّتِهِ;<br>\
or it may be خَصَّنِى لِمَوَدَّتِهِ إِيَّاىَ [in the TA<br>\
بِمَوَدَّتِهِ, which is evidently a mistranscription];<br>\
for, says ISd, we have not heard خَصَّهُ [or rather<br>\
خَصَّ] doubly transitive. (TA.) And [hence]<br>\
خَصَّهُ بِكَذَا also signifies He gave him such a thing<br>\
in large quantity, or abundantly. (TA.) [You<br>\
say also, خَصَّهُ بِالذِّكْرِ He distinguished, &amp;c., or<br>\
singled out, him, or it, by mention: or he particularized, peculiarized, or specified, him, or it,<br>\
thereby; he particularly, peculiarly, or specially,<br>\
mentioned him, or it. And خَصَّهُ, alone, He pointed<br>\
particularly, or peculiarly, to him, or it, in what<br>\
he said; or he meant particularly, or peculiarly,<br>\
him, or it. And خَصَّ مِنْهُ كَذَا He distinguished,<br>\
particularized, peculiarized, or specified, thereof<br>\
such a thing: and he distinguished therefrom<br>\
such a thing; he particularly, peculiarly, or<br>\
specially, excepted therefrom such a thing.] You<br>\
also say, خَصَّهُ لِنَفْسِهِ (TA) and لِنَفْسِهِ ↓ اختصّهُ (T,<br>\
A, TA) [He appropriated, or took, or chose, him,<br>\
or it, particularly, or specially, to, or for, himself; as also خَصَّ بِهِ نَفْسَهُ and بِهِ نَفْسَهُ ↓ اختصّ].<br>\
And فُلَانًا ↓ هُوَ يَسْتَخِصُّ and يَسْتَخْلِصُهُ (A, TA) [He<br>\
appropriates such a one purely to himself, exclusively of any partner; (see the latter verb;)] he<br>\
chooses such a one for himself; he appropriates<br>\
him to himself as his particular, or special, intimate; (TA in art. خلص;) both signify the<br>\
same. (S and K in art. خلص.) [And ↓ اختصّهُ<br>\
He treated him, or behaved towards him, with<br>\
partiality; was partial towards him: a signification implied by the first explanation in this art.:<br>\
and in this sense it is often used.]<br>\

it: see also the latter verb below.]<br>\

-b2-<br>\
[Used as a simple subst., Particularity; peculiarity; speciality, or specialty; as also the inf. ns.<br>\
↓ خَصُوصِيَّةٌ, and ↓ خُصُوصِيَّةٌ.] You say, لَهُ خُصُوصٌ<br>\
and ↓ خُصُوصِيَّةٌ [To him belongs a particularity,<br>\
&amp;c.], and بِى [in me is &amp;c.]. (A.) [Hence<br>\
خُصُوصًا Particularly; specially; as also ↓ خَاصَّةً.]<br>\
Th was heard to say, ↓ إِذَا ذُكِرَ الصَّالِحُونَ فَبَخَاصَّةٍ<br>\
أَبُو بَكْرٍ وَإِذَا ذُكِرَ الأَشْرَافُ فَبِخَاصَّةٍ عَلِىٌّ [meaning<br>\
فَخُصُوصًا, i. e., When the righteous are mentioned,<br>\

virtually mentioned; and when the shereefs are<br>\
mentioned, then in particular, or peculiarly,<br>\
&#39;Alee]. (L, TA.)<br>\
خَصَاصَةٌ An interstice, interval, or intervening<br>\

[a crevice, cranny, chink, or fissure:] or the first,<br>\
(TA,) or ↓ all, (K,) a small hole or perforation:<br>\
(K, TA:) or the first has this signification as<br>\
well as the signification first mentioned: (S:)<br>\
or the ↓ second, the like of a كَوَّة [or mural aperture] in a [structure of the kind called] قُبَّة, or<br>\
the like, when as wide as the face; or, accord. to<br>\
some, whether wide or narrow: (TA:) and the<br>\
same, interstices, intervals, or intervening spaces<br>\
or openings, in a خُصّ; (TA;) or narrow interstices, &amp;c., therein: (T, TA:) and the same,<br>\
(TA,) or ↓ all, (K,) the intervening spaces between<br>\
the three stones upon which a cooking-pot is placed;<br>\
(K, TA;) and between the fingers: (TA:) and<br>\
the first, the intervening spaces between the<br>\
feathers of an arrow: (IAar, TA:) pl. [of the<br>\
first,] خَصَاصَاتٌ. (TA.) You say of the moon,<br>\
بَدَا مِنْ خَصَاصَةِ الغَيْمِ [It appeared from the gap<br>\

difficulty; (Mgh;) an evil state or condition:<br>\
(TA:) from خَصَاصَات meaning the “ holes ” of a<br>\
sieve: whence a saying cited voce تَجَمَّلَ:<br>\
(Mgh:) or from the first of the senses explained<br>\
in this paragraph; because a thing, when it opens<br>\
so as to form an interstice, becomes weak and<br>\
unsound. (TA.) You say also, ↓ سَدَدْتُ خُصَاصَةَ<br>\
فُلَانٍ, with damm, meaning, (tropical:)  I repaired the<br>\
broken fortune of such a one. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\

خَاصٌّ Particular; peculiar; special; distinct,<br>\

(Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence, Choice; select. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And Pare; unmixed; unadulterated.] ―<br>\
-b4-  [Used<br>\
as a subst.,] it is syn. with ↓ خَاصَّةٌ; (Ks, Msb,<br>\
K;) in which the ة is a corroborative; (Msb;)<br>\
and which signifies Distinguished people; persons of distinction; the distinguished sort; contr.<br>\
of عَامَّةٌ: (S, Msb, K:) or the former is contr.<br>\
of عَامٌّ, and ↓ the latter is contr. of عَامَّةٌ: (TA:)<br>\
[the pl. of both is خَوَاصٌّ and ↓ خِصَّانٌ and ↓ خُصَّانٌ:<br>\
or, accord. to rule, the first of these is pl. only of<br>\
خَاصَّةٌ; and judging from other instances, we<br>\
should regard the second and third as more probably pls. of خَاصٌّ: but however the case may<br>\
be,] خِصَّانٌ is syn. with خَوَاصُّ, (S, K,) and so is<br>\
خُصَّانٌ. (K.) [You say, الخَاصُّ وَالعَامُّ, and<br>\
وَالعَمَّةُ ↓ الخَاصَّةُ, The distinguished and the common people; the persons of distinction and the<br>\
vulgar.] You also say, ↓ إِنَّمَا يَفْعَلُ هٰذَا خِصَّانٌ<br>\
مِنَ النَّاسِ meaning خَوَاصُّ مِنْهُمْ [Only distinguished persons of mankind do this]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [It<br>\
seems to be also, in some instances, syn. with<br>\
↓ خَاصَّةٌ as signifying A particular, peculiar, or<br>\
special, friend, intimate, familiar, companion,<br>\
associate, attendant, dependent, or servant:] the<br>\
latter is explained in the T [and JK] as meaning<br>\
a person whom thou hast appropriated, particularly distinguished, taken, or chosen, (اِخْتَصَصْتَهُ,)<br>\
[as a friend, &amp;c.,] to, or for, thyself: (TA:)<br>\
[and it is used as a sing. and as a pl.: for] you<br>\
say, هٰذَا خَاصَّتِى [This is my particular, or special, or choice, or choicest, friend, &amp;c.]: and<br>\
هُمْ خَاصَّتِى [They are my particular, or peculiar,<br>\
or special, or choice, or choicest, friends, &amp;c.].<br>\
(A.) You say also, فُلَانٌ خَاصٌّ لِفُلَانٍ, (Kull<br>\
p. 174,) or بِفُلَانٍ, (so in the L,) [app. meaning<br>\
لِفُلَانٍ, unless it be mistranscribed, and the latter<br>\
be the correct reading, which I think much the<br>\
more probable;] i. e., Such a one belongs exclusively [as a particular, or peculiar, or special,<br>\
friend, &amp;c.,] to such a one; (Kull;) and ↓ مُخَصٌّ<br>\
signifies the same. (L.) ―<br>\
-b6-  See the dim. of خَاصَّةٌ,<br>\
(namely خُوَيْصَّةٌ,) below.<br>\
خَاصَّةٌ: see خَاصٌّ, in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  It also<br>\
signifies A property of a thing, not found, or not<br>\
existing, either wholly or partly, in another<br>\
thing: and ↓ خَاصِّيَّةٌ [thus correctly written, and<br>\
thus I have always found it written except by<br>\
Golius and those who have probably imitated<br>\
him, who write it without the sheddeh to the ى,]<br>\
is used as denoting [a property, or particular<br>\
or peculiar virtue, which is] an unknown cause of<br>\
a known effect; as that by which a medicine operates: the former differs from the latter in being<br>\
conventionally applied to an effect, [or effective<br>\
property,] whether the cause of its existence be<br>\
known or not: [the pl. of the former is خَوَاصُّ,<br>\
agreeably with analogy and usage, like as عَوَامُّ<br>\
is pl. of عَامَّةٌ:] the pl. of the latter is خَاصِّيَّاتٌ<br>\
[and خَصَائِصُ]; and خَوَاصُّ is a quasi-pl. n., not<br>\
a pl., of the same. (Kull p. 174. [All the abovementioned words here cited from that work are<br>\
there without syll. signs, as being well known.<br>\
Both خاصّة and ↓ خاصّيّة, as here explained, are<br>\
perhaps post-classical; but of this I am not certain: and both are sometimes used as meaning<br>\
The peculiar nature of a thing; also termed its<br>\
essence.]) ―<br>\

خُوَيْصَّةٌ dim. of خَاصَّةٌ; (A, K;) [like دُوَيْبَّةٌ,<br>\
q. v., dim. of دَابَّةٌ;] originally خُوَيْصِصَةٌ; (TA;)<br>\
the ى being quiescent because the ى of the dim.<br>\
cannot be movent; (A, K;) [properly signifying<br>\
A little, or young, particular, or peculiar, or<br>\
special, friend, companion, associate, attendant,<br>\
or servant; and used in other senses, like other<br>\
diminutives; implying littleness of estimation;<br>\
and also affection, and awe.] It is said in a trad.,<br>\
(TA,) عَلَيْكَ بِخُوَيْصَّةِ نَفْسِكَ [Keep thou to the<br>\
little, or dear, particular friend of thine own self:<br>\
so it seems to mean accord. to Z, being mentioned<br>\
by him among the proper expressions belonging<br>\
to this art.: but accord. to the TK, it appears to<br>\
be tropical; for the meaning is there said to be,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  thine own particular state, or condition]. (A,<br>\
TA.) In another trad., خويصّة is used as signifying A little, young, particular, or peculiar, or<br>\
special, servant. (TA.) And in another trad. it is<br>\
said, بَادِرُوا بِالأَعْمَالِ سِتًّا الدَّجَّالِ وَكَذَا وَكَذَا<br>\
وَخُوَيْصَّةَ أَحَدِكُمْ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Strive ye to be before<br>\
six things with [good] works; Antichrist, and<br>\
such and such things, and the event of death which<br>\
is specially, or peculiarly, appointed to any one of<br>\
you: [or, I would rather say, the awful special<br>\
awaiter of any one of you; though it is asserted<br>\
that] the diminutive form is here used to denote<br>\
low estimation of that which it signifies in comparison with what follows it, namely, the resurrection, &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
