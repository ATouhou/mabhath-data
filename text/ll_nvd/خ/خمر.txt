10<br>\
استخمرهُ He made him, or took him as, a<br>\
slave: (S, Mgh, K:) of the dial. of El-Yemen.<br>\
(Mgh, TA.) [See 3.] So in the trad. of Mo&#39;ádh,<br>\
مَنْ اسْتَخْمَرَ قَوْمًا أَوَّلُهُمْ أَحْرَارٌ وَجِيرَانٌ مُسْتَضْعَفُونَ<br>\
فَلَهُ مَا قَصَرَ فِى بَيْتِهِ [Whosoever hath made slaves,<br>\
or taken as slaves, persons the first state of whomhath been that of freemen and neighbours, regarded as weak, to him shall belong what he hath<br>\
held in possession in his house or tent]: (S, * L:)<br>\
i. e., hath taken them by force, and obtained possession of them: (S:) meaning, whosoever hath<br>\
made slaves, or taken as slaves, persons in the<br>\
Time of Ignorance, and then El-Islám hath come,<br>\
to him shall belong those whom he hath held in<br>\
possession in his house or tent: they shall not go<br>\
from his hand. (Az, TA.) Mohammad Ibn-Ketheer says, This is a phrase known to us in ElYemen, where any other is scarcely ever used [in<br>\
its stead]. (S.)<br>\
خَمْرٌ [Wine: or grape-wine:] what intoxicates, of the expressed juice of grapes: (ISd, K:)<br>\
or the juice of grapes when it has effervesced,<br>\
and thrown up froth, and become freed therefrom, and still: (Mgh:) or it has a common<br>\
application to intoxicating expressed juice of anything: (K, TA:) or any intoxicating thing, that<br>\
clouds, or obscures, (lit. covers,) the intellect; as<br>\
some say: (Mgh, * Msb: [but see what follows:])<br>\
and the general application is the more correct,<br>\
because خَمْر was forbidden when there was not<br>\
in El-Medeeneh any خَمْر of grapes; the beverage of its inhabitants being prepared only from<br>\
dates in their green and small state, or full-grown<br>\
but unripe, or fresh and ripe, or dried: (K, *<br>\
TA:) or the arguing thus, from this fact alone,<br>\
requires consideration: (MF:) AHn says, it is<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  sometimes prepared from grains: but ISd<br>\
holds this to be an improper signification: (TA:)<br>\
it is also sometimes applied to the (assumed tropical:)  beverage<br>\
called نَبِيذ, like as نبيذ is sometimes applied to<br>\
wine expressed from grapes: (L in art. نبذ:)<br>\
applied to (tropical:)  expressed juice from which خَمْر [properly so called] is made, [i. e., to must, or unfermented نَبِيذ,] it is tropical: it is so used in a<br>\
trad. in which خَمْر is said to have been sold by<br>\
[a companion of Mohammad named] Samurah:<br>\
خَمْر [in its proper acceptation] is so called<br>\
because it veils (تَخْمُرُ, i. e. تَسْتُرُ,) the intellect:<br>\
(K:) or because it infects (تُخَامِرُ, i. e. تُخَالِطُ,)<br>\
the intellect: (S, K:) [as though acting like<br>\
leaven: (see 1:)] so said &#39;Omar: (TA:) or<br>\
because it is left until it has become mature [and<br>\
fermented]; (K;) or until its odour has changed:<br>\
(IAar, S:) [see 8:] the proper application of the<br>\
root is to denote “ covering,” and “ commingling<br>\
in a hidden manner: ” (Sgh, Er-Rághib, TA:) it<br>\
is of the fem. gender, and sometimes masc.:<br>\
(Msb, K:) you say هُوَ الخَمْرُ as well as هِىَ الخَمْرُ:<br>\
but As does not allow it to be masc.: (Msb:)<br>\
and ↓ خَمْرَةٌ signifies the same: (K:) [or a kind<br>\
of wine:] or خَمْرٌ and خَمْرَةٌ are like تَمْرٌ and تَمْرَةٌ;<br>\
[the former a coll. gen. n., and the latter its n. un.;]<br>\
(S;) and خَمْرَةٌ [thus] signifies some wine; lit., a<br>\
portion of خَمْر: (Msb:) the pl. of خَمْرٌ is خُمُورٌ.<br>\
(S, Msb.) You say [also] صِرْفٌ ↓ خَمْرَةٌ [Some<br>\
pure, or unmixed, wine; using a masc. epithet,<br>\
contr. to rule]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence the saying,] مَا<br>\
عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ خَلٌّ وَلَا خَمْرٌ, (S,) or مَا هُوَ بِخَلٍّ وَلَا خَمْرٍ,<br>\
(K,) (tropical:)  Such a one, (S,) or he, (K,) possesses<br>\
neither good nor evil: (S, K:) [or neither evil<br>\
nor good: for] AA says that some of the Arabs<br>\
make الخَمْرُ to be good, and الخَلُّ to be evil; and<br>\
some of them make الخمر to be evil, and الخلّ<br>\
to be good. (Har p. 153.) ―<br>\
-b3-  خَمْرٌ also signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Grapes; (AHn, M, K;) in the dial. of ElYemen:) (M:) like as عِنَبٌ signifies “ wine ”<br>\
in that dial. (AHn, TA in art. عنب.) It is said<br>\
in the Kur [xii. 36], إِنِّى أَرَانِى أَعْصِرُ خَمْرًا Verily<br>\
I thought myself pressing grapes: (ISd:) or the<br>\
meaning is, pressing out wine from grapes. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Arafeh.)<br>\
خَمَرٌ A covert of trees &amp;c.: (ISk, S, Mgh, K:)<br>\
or a place where the ground is eaten away by a<br>\
torrent, or an oblong tract of sand collected together and elevated, forming a place for concealment: (ISk, S:) and a hollow, or cavity, in<br>\
which a wolf conceals himself: and tangled trees.<br>\
(TA.) You say, تَوَارَى الصَّيْدُ مِنِّى فِى خَمَرِ الوَادِى<br>\
[The game, or wild animal or animals, concealed<br>\
itself, or themselves, from me in the covert, &amp;c.,<br>\
of the valley]. (S.) And هُوَ يَدِبُّ لَهُ الضَّرَآءَ وَ يَمْشِى<br>\
لَهُ الخَمَرَ (assumed tropical:)  [He creeps to him in the thicket, or<br>\
place overgrown with trees; and he walks to him<br>\
in the covert of trees, &amp;c.: see Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov. 913]: speaking of a man when he deceives,<br>\
or circumvents, his companion. (S.) And جَآءَنَا<br>\
عَلَى خَمْرٍ and ↓ على خِمْرَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  He came to us<br>\
secretly; unexpectedly; clandestinely. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, (S,) خَمَرٌ and ↓ خُمَارٌ and ↓ خَمَارٌ (S, K)<br>\
and ↓ خَمْرَةٌ (K) (assumed tropical:)  A crowding, (S,) or congregation, (K,) and multitude, of men or people.<br>\

entered among the crowding and multitude of the<br>\
men or people; (S;) and in like manner, فى<br>\

(TA:) thought by ISd to be a possessive epithet:<br>\
(TA:) or in the last stage of the remains of intoxication. (S.) [See also مَخْمُورٌ.])<br>\
خَمْرَةٌ: see خَمْرٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S, A,<br>\
K,) and ↓ خِمْرَةٌ (Kr, K) and ↓ خُمْرَةٌ, (K,) The<br>\
odour of perfume: (S, A:) or a sweet odour:<br>\
(K:) and the last signifies also an odour which<br>\
has infected (خَامَرَ, i. e. خَالَطَ,) a person; (K;)<br>\
as also ↓ خَمَرَةٌ. (AZ, K.) You say, وَجَدْتُ خَمْرَةَ<br>\
الطِّيبِ I experienced, or smelt, the odour of the<br>\
perfume. (S, A.)<br>\
-A2-  See also خَمَرٌ, in two places.<br>\
