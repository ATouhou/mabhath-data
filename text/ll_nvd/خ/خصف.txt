خَصْفٌ [inf. n. of خَصَفَ] signifies The act of<br>\
adjoining, and putting together. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
(TA,) خَصَفَ, (S, Msb, K, TA,) aor.<br>\
خَصِفَ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. خَصْفٌ, (Msb,) He sewed a sole (S,<br>\
K, TA) [so as to make it double], covering, or<br>\
facing, one piece with another: (TA:) or he<br>\
patched a sole; mended it by sewing on another<br>\
piece. (Msb.) And He made anything double,<br>\
putting one piece upon another; he faced it.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence,] خَصَفَ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ, (JK,)<br>\
or خَصَفَ الوَرَقَ عَلَى بَدَنِهِ, (S, * K,) aor. as above,<br>\
(S, TA,) and so the inf. n.; (TA;) and ↓ اختصف;<br>\
(S, K;) and ↓ اخصف; (K;) and ↓ خصّف, inf. n.<br>\
تَخْصِيفٌ; (TA;) (tropical:)  He stuck [or sewed] the leaves<br>\
together, one to another, (S, K, * TA,) and covered<br>\
his person with them, leaf by leaf, (K,) to conceal<br>\
therewith his pudenda: (S, TA:) or the first<br>\
phrase, (JK,) as also ↓ اختصف, (Lth, JK,) signifies he (a naked man) put upon his pudenda<br>\
wide leaves, (Lth, JK,) or the like: (Lth:) you<br>\
say, بِكَذَا ↓ اختصف [he covered his pudenda with<br>\
such a thing]. (Lth, JK.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[vii. 21 and xx. 119], وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِنْ<br>\
وَرَقِ الجَنَّةِ; and ↓ يَخِصِّفَانِ, originally يَخْتَصِفَانِ,<br>\
by some pronounced ↓ يَخَصِّفَانِ, (S, TA,) and by<br>\
some, ↓ يَخْصِّفَانِ, with two quiescent letters together; (TA; [but this appears to be incorrect;<br>\
see 8 in art. خصم;]) and ↓ يُخْصِفَانِ, from<br>\
أَخْصَفَ; and ↓ يُخَصِّفَانِ, from خَصَّفَ; (Ksh and<br>\
Bd in vii. 21, and TA;) thus accord. to different<br>\
readings; i. e. (tropical:)  And they betook themselves to<br>\
sticking [or sewing] together, one to another, of<br>\
the leaves of Paradise, to conceal therewith their<br>\
pudenda. (S, TA.) And hence, also, the saying,<br>\
in a trad., إِذَا دَخَلَ أَحَدُكُمُ الحَمَّامَ فَعَلَيْهِ بِالنَّشِيرِ<br>\
↓ وَلَا يُخَصِّفْ, i. e. (tropical:)  [When any one of you enters<br>\
the bath,] let him take the waist-wrapper, and<br>\
not put his hand upon his pudendum: and like<br>\
this in meaning is تخصّفه [app. a mistranscription<br>\
for ↓ يَتَخَصَّفُ, or ↓ يَخِصِّفُ or the like, for يَخْتَصِفُ:<br>\
if not, it must be ↓ تَخَصَّفَهُ, meaning he put his<br>\
hand upon it]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence also the saying,]<br>\
فَمَا زَالُوا يَخْصِفُونَ أَخْفَافَ المَطِىِّ بِحَوَافِرِ الخَيْلِ<br>\
حَتَّى لِحِقُوهُمْ (tropical:)  And they ceased not to make the prints<br>\
of the feet of the camels to be covered by the prints of<br>\
the hoofs of the horses [until they overtook them];<br>\
as though they sewed these upon the others, like as<br>\
one sews a sole by covering, or facing, one piece<br>\
with another. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And خُصِفَتِ الكَتِيبَةُ مِنْ<br>\
وَرَائِهَا بِخَيْلٍ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [The body of troops] was followed [by horsemen]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And خَصَفَ, aor.<br>\
خَصِفَ,<br>\
inf. n. خَصْفٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He lied. (Munjid of Kr. [See<br>\
خَصَّافٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b7-  And خَصَفْتُ فُلَانًا (tropical:)  I exceeded such a<br>\
one in reviling [as though adding reviling upon reviling]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  خَصَفَتْ, (AZ, S, K,) aor.<br>\
خَصِفَ,<br>\
(AZ, S,) inf. n. خِصَافٌ, said of a she-camel, She<br>\
cast her young one in the ninth month: (AZ,<br>\
S, K:) the epithet applied to her in this case is<br>\
↓ خَصُوفٌ: (AZ, S:) or, as some say, (S,) this<br>\
epithet signifies one that brings forth a year and<br>\
a month, (S, and so in some copies of the K,) in<br>\
[some of] the copies of the K a year and two<br>\
months, which is wrong, (TA,) after the time<br>\
when she was covered: (S, K:) جَرُورٌ is applied<br>\
to one that brings forth a year and two months<br>\
after that time: (S, TA:) or ↓ the former epithet<br>\
signifies one that brings forth on the completion<br>\
of the year: (IAar, TA:) or one of the camels<br>\
termed مَرَابِيع [pl. of مِرْبَاعٌ q. v.] that brings forth<br>\
at the completion of the year; or one of such<br>\
camels that brings forth when she comes to the<br>\
time of the year in which she was covered, completely: (TA:) and ↓ اختصفت signifies she (a<br>\
camel) became such as is termed خَصُوف. (JK,<br>\
TA.)<br>\

former phrase means, as some say, followed by<br>\
horsemen; and therefore the epithet is without ة,<br>\
because it has the signification of a pass. part. n.:<br>\

had said خَصِيفَةٌ, because it would in this latter<br>\
