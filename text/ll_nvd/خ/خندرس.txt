this it is objected that د is not augmentative: the<br>\
truth is, that it is of the measure فَعْلَلِيلٌ, as Sb<br>\

Greek word, arabicized: (K:) [but I know not<br>\
how this is, unless, as an epithet applied to wheat,<br>\

word: it may be an arabicized word from the<br>\
Persian خَنْدَهْ رِيشْ, meaning “ having a laughing<br>\
beard,” [or rather “one whose beard is laughed<br>\
at,” i. e., “a laughing-stock,”] because he who<br>\
makes use of it [namely of wine] has his beard<br>\
laughed at. (TA.) ―<br>\
