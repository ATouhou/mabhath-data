خِضْرِمٌ A well having much water; (JK, K;)<br>\

copious and wide in the utmost degree: (Mz<br>\
49th نوع:) and anything much in quantity, or<br>\
copious, (S, K,) and wide, or ample: (S:) or it<br>\

then, خُضَرِمٌ; and then, ضَبٌّ: he does not mention the term غَيْدَاقٌ, but AZ mentions it. (S.)<br>\
خِضْرِمِىٌّ: see الخَضَارِمَةُ.<br>\
خُضَارِمٌ: see خِضْرِمٌ, in two places.<br>\
الخَضَارِمَةُ A certain people of the عَجَم [i. e.<br>\
Persians], (S, K,) of the sons of Fáris, (S,) who<br>\
went forth [from their country] in the beginning<br>\
of El-Islám, and dwelt in Syria: (S, K:) i. e.,<br>\
those people who went forth at that period dispersed themselves in the countries of the Arabs;<br>\
some of them settling in El-Basrah, and these are<br>\
the أَسَاوِرَة; and some of them, in El-Koofeh, and<br>\
these are the أَحَامِرَة; and some of them, in Syria,<br>\
and they are the خَضَارِمَة; and some of them, in<br>\
El-Jezeereh, and they are the جَرَاجِمَة; and some<br>\
of them, in El-Yemen, and they are the أَبْنَآء; and<br>\
some of them, in El-Mowsil, and they are the<br>\
جَرَامِقَة: (S, TA:) the n. un. is ↓ خِضْرِمِىٌّ. (K.)<br>\

(Mz ubi suprá,) A man, (K, Mz,) or a poet, (S,<br>\
K,) who lived in the Time of Ignorance and in<br>\
that of El-Islám; (S, K, and Mz ubi suprà) as<br>\
though he were cut off from paganism to ElIslám; (Mz ubi suprà;) or from infidelity; (IB,<br>\
TA;) as Lebeed, (S, K, and Mz 20th نوع,) and<br>\
Hassán Ibn-Thábit, and Nábighah of the BenooJaadeh, and Aboo-Zubeyd, and &#39;Amr Ibn-Sha-s,<br>\
and Ez-Zibrikán Ibn-Bedr, and &#39;Amr Ibn-MaadeeKerib, and Kaab Ibn-Zuheyr, and Maan Ibn-Ows: (Mz 20th نوع: [see also إِسْلَامِىٌّ, and<br>\
شَاهِدٌ:]) or a person who passed half of his life<br>\
in the Time of Ignorance, and half thereof in<br>\
that of El-Islám: (K:) [I have generally found<br>\
the word thus written;] but IB says that, accord.<br>\
to most of the lexicologists, it is ↓ مُخَضْرِمٌ, with<br>\
kesr to the ر; for the pagans, when they became<br>\
Muslims, cut somewhat of the extremities of the<br>\
ears of their camels (خَضْرَمُوا آذَانَ إِبِلِهِمْ) as a<br>\
sign of their being Muslims in case of their being<br>\
attacked and plundered, or their being made war<br>\
with; (IB, TA;) and this they were ordered to<br>\
do in a manner different from that of the pagans:<br>\
(TA:) accord. to some, the epithet applied to a<br>\
poet of the class above mentioned is محضرم, with<br>\
the unpointed ح, [i. e. مُحَضْرِمٌ,] from الحَضْرَمَةٌ<br>\
signifying الخَلْطُ, [like الخَضْرَمَةُ, as shown<br>\
above,] because of his mixing paganism with<br>\
El-Islám: (Mz 49th نوع:) or مُحَضْرَمٌ: (K in<br>\
art. حضرم:) and in like manner IKh explains<br>\
the epithet ↓ مُخَضْرِمٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A black<br>\
man whose father is white. (IKh, K. *) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
Deficient in respect of الحَسَب; (K;) meaning<br>\
not of generous parentage. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And One<br>\
whose origin is suspected; or who claims for his<br>\
father one who is not: (K:) and so مُخَضْرَمُ<br>\
النَّسَبِ: (S, TA:) or مُخَضْرَمٌ فِى نَسَبِهِ means of<br>\
mixed parentage. (TA.) One whose father is<br>\
unknown: [or, app., accord. to the TA, whose<br>\
parents are unknown:] or one sprung from [a<br>\
succession of] concubines. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Uncircumcised.<br>\
(K.) And, with ة, applied to a woman, Circumcised: (S, K:) or, as some say, cut, by a<br>\
mistake of the woman operating, in a place<br>\
not that of circumcision. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Flesh-meat<br>\
such that one knows not whether it be from a<br>\
male or a female. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Accord. to IAar,<br>\
who does not explain it, (ISd, TA,) it is applied<br>\
also to food, (ISd, K,) ISd thinks (TA) as meaning Insipid; (ISd, K;) neither sweet nor bitter.<br>\
(ISd.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And Water between heavy and light:<br>\
(T, K, TA:) or not sweet. (TA.) ―<br>\
