load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'خوأخَآءٌ The name of the letter خ, q. v.; as also<br>\
خَا: [it is called خَا in a case of pause, and خَآءٌ<br>\
when made a noun:] it is fem. and masc.: [its<br>\
dim. is خَيَيَّةٌ, meaning a خ written small, or indistinct: (see حَآءٌ in art. حوأ:)] and its pl. is<br>\
أَخْوَآءٌ and أَخْيَآءٌ and خَاآتٌ. (TA in باب الالف<br>\
الليّنة.)<br>\
خَآءِ بِكَ عَلَيْنَا, (AZ * and S * and TA in باب<br>\
الالف الليّنة, and K and TA in the present art.,)<br>\
in which خَآءِ is a صَوْت [or noun significant of a<br>\
sound], indecl., with kesr for its termination;<br>\
(S, TA;) and خَائِى بك, as in the Book of the<br>\
Nawádir by Ibn-Háni, (Az, TA,) in which latter,<br>\
ISd says, the ى is not for a sign of the fem.<br>\
gender, because the word is a صوت; and, as Sh<br>\
says, on the authority of A&#39;Obeyd, خَائِبِكَ; but<br>\
correctly written as in the Book of Ibn-Háni;<br>\
(Az, TA;) Hasten thou [to us]: (AZ, Az, S, K,<br>\
TA:) it is also used in addressing a female, and<br>\
two persons, and a pl. number: (S, TA:) you<br>\
say [خَآءِ بِكِ, and] خَائِى بِكِ; and خآءِ بِكُمَا, and<br>\
خَائِى بِكُمَا; and [خَآءِ بِكُمْ, and] خَائِى بِكُمْ. (TA.)<br>\
In the saying of El-Kumeyt,<br>\
بِخَائِى بِكَ الْحَقْ يَهْتِفُونَ وَحَىَّ هَلْ<br>\
[which app. means Calling out “ Hasten thou,<br>\
come up with us,” and “ Come,” or “ come<br>\
quickly,  ” &amp;c.,] it is held by Ibn-Selemeh to be<br>\
used as an imprecation, meaning خِبْتَ [mayest<br>\
thou be disappointed of attaining that which thou<br>\
desirest]; the poet saying بِخَائِبِكَ for بِأَمْرِكَ الَّذِى<br>\
خَابَ وَخَسِرَ [meaning By thine affair that shall<br>\
result in disappointment, and be an occasion of<br>\
loss]: which, as you see, is at variance with the<br>\
explanation of AZ. (S, TA.)<br>\
خَائِىٌّ and خَاوِىٌّ and خَوِىٌّ [a mistranscription<br>\
for خَيَوِىٌّ, like بَيَوِىٌّ and تَيَوِىٌّ] rel. ns. of خَآءٌ<br>\
and خَا the names of the letter خ. (TA in باب<br>\
الالف اللّينة.)<br>\
