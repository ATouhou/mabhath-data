خَزَمَهُ, aor.<br>\
خَزِمَ, (Mgh, K,) inf. n. خَزْمٌ, (JK,<br>\
TA,) He pierced it, or perforated it; (JK,<br>\
Mgh, K;) namely, a thing of any kind: for<br>\
instance, the nose of a camel, for the [ring called]<br>\
خِزَامَة [to which the rein is attached]: and the<br>\
letter of a Kádee to another Kádee; for such a<br>\
letter is pierced for the سِحَآءَة [or strip of paper<br>\
with which it is bound], and is then sealed [upon<br>\
this strip]; and when this is done, the letter is<br>\
said to be ↓ مَخْزُومٌ. (Mgh.) You say, خَزَمَ<br>\
البَعِيرَ, aor. as above, (Mgh, Msb,) and so the<br>\
inf. n., (Msb,) He pierced the nose of the camel<br>\
(Mgh, Msb) for the خِزَامَة: (Mgh:) or خَزَمَ<br>\
البَعِيرَ (S, K) بِالخِزَامَةِ, (S,) aor. and inf. n. as<br>\
above, (TA,) he put the خزامة in the side of<br>\
the nostril, (K,) or in the partition between the<br>\
nostrils, (S,) [but the former is the more common<br>\
practice,] of the camel; (S, K;) as also ↓ خزّمهُ;<br>\
(K;) [or] this signifies the doing so much, or<br>\
often. (TA.) [Hence,] خَزَمَ أَنْفَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He brought<br>\
him under, or into, subjection; rendered him submissive, tractable, or manageable. (TA.) And<br>\
خَزَمْتُ الجَرَادَ فِى العُودِ I spitted the locusts in a<br>\
series upon the [skewer, or] piece of stick or<br>\
wood. (S.) And خَزَمَ شِرَاكَ نَعْلِهِ He pierced and<br>\
tied the [thong called] شَراك [q. v.] of his sandal<br>\
[app. so as to attach to it the two branches (عَضُدَا<br>\
الشِّرَاكِ) of the strap that encompasses the heel].<br>\
(TA, [See also خِزَامَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also He cut it.<br>\
for] الخَزْمُ is syn. with القَطْعُ. (Ham p. 166.<br>\
[It is there also said to be syn. with الشد; i. e.<br>\
الشَّدُّ; but this is app. a mistake for الشَّكُّ, a<br>\
meaning assigned to it in the JK, agreeably with<br>\
the K.])<br>\

خازمهُ, (S,) or خازِمهُ الطَّرِيقَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
مُخَازَمَةٌ (S in art. خصر) [and خِزَامٌ], He (a man,<br>\
S) took a different way from his (another&#39;s)<br>\
until they both met in one place: (S, K:) the<br>\
doing so is also termed مُخَاصَرَةٌ: (S in art. خصر,<br>\
and TA:) it is as though it were a rivalling, or<br>\
imitating, in travelling. (TA.) Ibn-Fesweh<br>\
says,<br>\
إِذَا هُوَ نَحَّاهَا عَنِ القَصْدِ خَازَمَتْ<br>\
بِهِ الجَوْرَ حَتَّى تَسْتَقِيمُ ضُحَى الغَدِ<br>\
i. e. When he turns her, meaning his she-camel,<br>\
from the right way, she pursues with him a way<br>\
different from the wrong, so that she overcomes<br>\
him, and takes the right way, in the early daytime of the morrow. (TA.) مُخَازَمَةٌ also signifies<br>\
The act of rivalling, or imitating. (JK, TA.)<br>\
And one says, لَقِيتُهُ خِزَامًا (JK, TA) and مَخَازَمَةً,<br>\
(JK,) meaning I met him face to face: (TA:)<br>\
or suddenly, or unexpectedly, and face to face.<br>\

خَزَمٌ A certain kind of tree, (JK, T, S, Msb,<br>\
K,) of the bark of which ropes are made: (S,<br>\
Msb:) it is like the دَوْم [or Theban palm]; (K;)<br>\
having branches with small dates, which become<br>\
black when ripe, bitter, astringent, or disagreeable<br>\
and choking; not eaten by men; but the crows<br>\
are greedy of them, and come to them time after<br>\
time: so says AHn.: (TA:) n. un. with ة. (S,<br>\

nose of a she-camel: (JK:) or, accord. to the K,<br>\
a بُرَة which is put in the side of the nostril of the<br>\
camel: but Lth says that when it is of brass it is<br>\
termed بُرَة; and when of [goat&#39;s] hair, خِزَامَة:<br>\
(TA:) pl. خَزَائِمُ (JK, Msb, TA) and خِزَامَاتٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) [Hence,] أَعْطَى القُرْآنَ خَزَائِمَهُ: from a<br>\

أَنْ يُعْطُوا القُرْآنَ بِخَزَاتِمِهِمْ (tropical:)  Command ye them<br>\
that they submit themselves to the judgment, or<br>\
decision, of the Kur-án; خزائم being here pl. of<br>\
خِزَامَةٌ: (IAth, TA:) or أَعْطُوا القُرْآنَ خَزَائِمَهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Render ye to the Kur-án its due. (JK.) [In<br>\

A slender thong which is pierced and tied between<br>\

خُزَامَى A certain plant, (JK, K, TA,) called<br>\
also ↓ خُزَمٌ, (JK,) of sweet odour: (TA:) or<br>\
i. q. خِيرِىُّ البَرِّ [q. v.]; (S, Msb, K;) accord. to<br>\
El-Fárábee: one of the plants of the desert: said<br>\
by Az to be a certain herb of sweet odour, having<br>\
a flower like that of the violet: (Msb:) [accord.<br>\
to the book entitled مَا لَا يَسَعُ الطَّبِيبَ جَهْلَهُ, as<br>\
stated by Golius, a certain wild herb, having a<br>\
long stalk, small leaves, red flower, and very sweet<br>\
odour:] its flower is the sweetest of flowers in<br>\
odour; the fumigation therewith dispels every<br>\
fetid odour; the use thereof as a suppository in<br>\
the vagina promotes pregnancy; and the taking<br>\
it internally restores to a right state the liver and<br>\
the spleen, and the brain affected with cold: (K:)<br>\
[in the present day, applied to the common lavender; lavandula spica:] n. un. خُزَامَاةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
خَزُومَةٌ i. q. بَقَرَةٌ [app. as meaning both A bull<br>\
and a cow], (JK, S, K,) in the dial. of Hudheyl;<br>\
(S;) or such as is advanced in age, and short:<br>\
(M, K:) pl. ↓ خَزُومٌ, [or rather this is a coll. gen.<br>\
n.,] and [the pl. is] خَزَائِمُ (JK, K) and خَزُومَاتٌ<br>\
(S) and [quasi-pl. n.] ↓ خَزَمٌ. (TA.)<br>\
خَزَّامٌ A maker of ropes of the bark of the tree<br>\
called خَزَم. (JK, S. *) [Accord. to the K, A<br>\
seller of the kind of tree called خَزَم: but this is a<br>\
mistake, app. caused by an omission in the K.]<br>\
اريحٌ خَازِمٌ (assumed tropical:)  A cold wind; as though it pierced<br>\
through the extremities: so says Kr: A&#39;Obeyd<br>\
says خَارِمٌ: accord. to the K, both signify the<br>\
same. (TA.)<br>\
مُخَزَّمٌ; and its fem., with ة: see what follows,<br>\
in four places.<br>\
مَخْزُومٌ Anything pierced or perforated: (S,<br>\
Mgh:) applied in this sense, (JK,) or as meaning pierced and tied, (TA, [see 1,]) to the [thong,<br>\
of a sandal, called] شِرَاك; (JK, TA;) or, thus<br>\
applied, it means cut. (Ham p. 166.) See also 1,<br>\
first sentence, for its meaning as applied to a<br>\
letter. ―<br>\
-b2-  Any animal having the nose pierced.<br>\

rings such as are termed خَزَائِم (pl. of خِزَامَة) in<br>\
their nostrils; (IAar, K, TA;) as also ↓ مُخَزَّمَةٌ.<br>\
(IAar, TA.) All birds, also, are said to be<br>\
مَخْزُومَة, (S, K,) and ↓ مُخَزَّمَة; (K;) because<br>\
perforated in the partition between the nostrils:<br>\
(S, K:) and particularly the ostrich is said to be<br>\
مَخْزُوم (S, K *) and ↓ مُخَزَّم. (JK, K. *) One says,<br>\
↓ مَاهُمْ إِلَّا كَالْأَنْعَامِ المُخَزَّمَةِ, meaning (tropical:)  They are<br>\
none others than stupid, or foolish, persons. (TA.<br>\
[But كَالْأَنْعَامِ is app., here, a mistranscription<br>\
for كَالنَّعَامِ; for the ostrich is proverbial for stupidity: one says أَحْمَقُ مِنْ نَعَامَةٍ “ More stupid<br>\
than an ostrich: ” because, as Meyd says, when an<br>\
ostrich happens to see the eggs of another ostrich,<br>\
it will sit upon them, and forget its own eggs.])<br>\
