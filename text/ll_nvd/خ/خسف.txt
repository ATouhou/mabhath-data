الخسوف often occurs in the trads., as said of the<br>\
sun; though the term commonly known in the<br>\
classical language is الكسوف [in this case]: and<br>\
it is said in a trad., إِنَّ الشَّمْسَ وَ القَمَرَ لَايَخْسِفَانِ<br>\
لِمَوْتِ أَحَدٍ أَوْ لِحَيَاتِهِ [Verily the sun and the moon<br>\
suffer not eclipse for the death of any one or for<br>\
