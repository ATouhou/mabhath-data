خَرِسَ, (Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
خَرَسَ, (K,) inf. n. خَرَسٌ,<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K,) He (a man) was dumb; was<br>\
naturally, by conformation, prevented from speaking; (Msb;) [he was destitute of the faculty of<br>\
speech, by natural conformation, like the beast:<br>\
see أَخْرَسُ:] or he was, or became, tonguetied, or<br>\
withheld from speech, (A, K,) either from inability to find words to express what he would say,<br>\
or by natural conformation [of the organs of<br>\
speech]. (TA.) You say also خَرِسَ المَجْلِسُ The<br>\
assembly was, or became, mute, or speechless. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  خَرَسَ المَرْأَةَ, (Lh, IAth,) aor.<br>\
خَرُسَ, (Lh,) [inf. n.,<br>\
app., خَرْسٌ,] He fed the woman with what is<br>\
termed خُرْسَة; (Lh, IAth;) He fed her on the<br>\
occasion of child-birth; (Lh;) as also ↓ خرّس<br>\
عَليهَا, inf. n. تَخْرِيسٌ (S, K) and تَخْرِسَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
In like manner you say, ↓ خرّسهَا, inf. n. تَخْرِيسٌ;<br>\
and خرس عَنْهَا; [so in the TA, without any syll.<br>\
signs to the verb;] He made for her what is<br>\
termed خُرْسَة. (TA.) And ↓ خُرِسَتْ, (S, L,) or<br>\
خُرِسَتْ, (so in a copy of the A,) She was fed with<br>\
what is so termed: (A:) or a feast on the occasion of her having given birth to a child was made<br>\
for her. (S, L.)<br>\
-A3-  خَرِسَ, aor.<br>\
خَرَسَ, He drank from<br>\
the [kind of wine-jar called] خَرْس, (Sgh, K,) i. e.<br>\

2<br>\
خَرَّسَ see خَرَسَ, in three places.<br>\
4<br>\
اخرسهُ اللّٰهُ [God made him to be dumb: see<br>\
خَرِسَ]: (S:) God made him to be tonguetied, or<br>\
speechless, (A, K,) either from inability to find<br>\
words to express what he would say, or by natural<br>\
conformation [of the organs of speech]. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تخرّست She made for herself the food for the<br>\
occasion of child-birth, (A, * K,) i. e., what is<br>\
called خُرْسَة. (TA.) Hence the prov. تَخَرَّسِى<br>\
يَانَفْسُ لَا مُخَرِّسَةَ لَكِ (A, * TA) Make thou the food<br>\
for child-birth for thyself, O self: there is no<br>\
maker of it for thee: said by a woman who had<br>\
given birth to a child and had not any one to care<br>\
for her: alluding to a man&#39;s taking care for himself: (K, TA:) and also related [in the A]<br>\
without the words يا نفس. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تخارس [He feigned himself dumb, or speechless,] is from خَرِسَ المَجْلِسُ: hence إِذَا شَهِدْتَ<br>\
مَنْ لَا يَفْهَمُ عَنْكَ فَتَخَارَسٌ [When thou art present<br>\
with, or beholdest, him who will not understand<br>\
what thou sayest, then feign thyself dumb, or<br>\
speechless]. (A.)<br>\
خَرْسٌ A [wine-jar such as is called] دَنّ; (JK,<br>\
S, K;) as also ↓ خِرْسٌ, (Kr, K,) and خِرْصٌ:<br>\
(TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَخْرَاسٌ (JK) and [of mult.]<br>\

خُرْسٌ Food that is prepared on the occasion<br>\
of the birth of a child; (S, A, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ خِرَاسٌ. (Lh, TA.) IJ seems to assign to it<br>\
also the sense of خُرْسَةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, as also<br>\
↓ the second word, A feast, or banquet, that is prepared on that occasion, and to which people are<br>\
invited: so in a trad. of Hassán, كَانَ إِذَا دُعِىَ إِلَى<br>\
طَعَامٍ قَالَ إِلَى عُرْسٍ أَمْ خُرْسٍ أَمْ إِعْذَارٍ [He used,<br>\
when he was invited to food, to say, To a weddingfeast, or a feast for child-birth, or a circumcisionfeast?]; and if it were for one of these, he consented: but if not, he did not consent. (TA.)<br>\
خِرْسٌ: see خَرْسٌ.<br>\
خُرْسَةٌ Food for a woman who has given birth<br>\
to a child; (S, A, K;) what is made for her,<br>\
such as فَرِيقَة and the like; as also [خُرْصَةٌ,] with<br>\
ص. (TA.) خُرْسَةُ مَرْيَمَ [The child-birth-food of<br>\
Maryam], applied to dates, and occurring in a<br>\
trad., alludes to verse 25 of chap. xix. of the<br>\
Kur, وَهُزِّى إِلَيْكِ الخ: and Khálid Ibn-Safwán<br>\
uses in the same manner the phrase ↓ تَخْرِسَةُ<br>\
مَرْيَمَ; in which تخرسة is an inf. n. used as a<br>\
subst.; or it may be a subst., like تَوْرِيَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
خُرْسَى A she-camel that does not utter the cry<br>\
termed رُغَآء. (Ibn-&#39; Abbád, Sgh, K.)<br>\
خِرَاسٌ: see خُرْسٌ, in two places.<br>\
خَرُوسٌ A بِكْر [or female that has not yet<br>\
brought forth] in the first period of her pregnancy: and (some say, S) one for whom خُرْسَة<br>\
is made: (S, K:) and one having a scanty flow<br>\
of milk. (Sgh, K.)<br>\

so that he reiterates it therein: such a one they<br>\

in which they are termed] شَوْل, because in most<br>\
