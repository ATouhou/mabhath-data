خَدَجَتْ, aor.<br>\
خَدِجَ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
خَدُجَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. خِدَاجٌ, (S, K, *) or this is a simple subst.,<br>\
(Msb,) She (a camel, AZ, S, Msb, K, and any<br>\
cloven-hoofed or solid-hoofed animal, AZ, Msb,<br>\
TA, or sometimes another female, TA) cast her<br>\
young one before the completion of the days of<br>\
gestation, (AZ, IKt, S, Msb, K,) to which IKoot<br>\
adds, (Msb,) even if it were completely formed;<br>\
(S, Msb;) as also خَدَجَتْ وَلَدَهَا; (IKtt, Msb;)<br>\
and ↓ خدّجت, inf. n. تَخْدِيجٌ: (TA:) or, as<br>\
some say, she cast her young one when her pregnancy had become apparent, between the commencement of its formation and the period a<br>\
little before the completion; as also ↓ اخدجت<br>\
وَلَدَهَا; but see the latter verb below: (Msb:) or<br>\
she (a camel) cast her young one in a defective<br>\
state, before the time: or without any hair upon<br>\
it: or miscarried, bringing forth merely blood:<br>\
and Thábit mentions the last but one of these<br>\
significations as relating to a human being: (TA:)<br>\
or you say of a woman, خَدَجَتْ وَلَدَهَا and<br>\
↓ أَخْدَجَتْهُ in one and the same sense, (Aboo-Kheyreh, TA,) meaning she cast her fœtus in<br>\
such a state that its form had become apparent:<br>\
and خَدَجَتْ she miscarried, bringing forth merely<br>\
blood: when she has brought it forth before its<br>\
hair has grown, one says of her غَضَنَتْ: so says<br>\
Az. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And خَدَجَ (tropical:)  He (a man) was, or<br>\
became, deficient in a limb, or member. (A.) ―<br>\

اخدجت She (a camel) brought forth her<br>\
young one imperfectly formed, (S, Mgh, K,) even<br>\
if the period of gestation were complete: (S, K:)<br>\
or so اخدجت وَلَدَهَا: and the former, she brought<br>\
forth her young one imperfectly formed at the<br>\
completion of the period: (IKt, Msb:) or she<br>\
brought forth her young one completely formed<br>\
before the proper time of bringing forth. (TA.)<br>\
