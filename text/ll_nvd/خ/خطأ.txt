خَطڤاَخَطِئَ is syn. with ↓ اخطأ, inf. n. إِخْطَآءٌ and<br>\
↓ خَاطِئَةٌ, (K,) which latter, mentioned by AAF,<br>\
on the authority of AZ, is extr. in the case of a<br>\
triliteral [unaugmented] verb, and more so in the<br>\
case of a quadriliteral [i. e. a triliteral augmented<br>\
by one letter]; (TA;) and with ↓ تخطّأ; signifying He did wrong; or committed a mistake,<br>\
or an error: (K:) [and if this and similar explanations be correct, خَطَأْ may be an inf. n. of<br>\
the first of these verbs, and a quasi-inf. n. of the<br>\
second and third:] or ↓ اخطأ and ↓ تخطّأ have<br>\
this signification: (S:) and خَطِئَ, aor.<br>\
خَطَاَ, inf. n.<br>\
خِطْءٌ and خِطْأَةٌ, (S, K,) signifies he committed a<br>\
sin, a crime, or an act of disobedience for which<br>\
he deserved punishment: (S, K: *) or he committed a fault or an offence or an act of disobe<br>\
dience [in an absolute sense]: (K, * TA:) or,<br>\
accord. to AO, (Msb,) or A&#39; Obeyd, (TA,)<br>\
خَطِئَ, inf. n. خِطْءٌ, signifies he committed a fault,<br>\
an offence, or an act of disobedience, unintentionally; as also ↓ اخطأ: (Msb, TA:) or, as<br>\
others say, خَطِئَ means [he committed a fault,<br>\
&amp;c.,] in religion; and ↓ اخطأ, in anything; intentionally or unintentionally: (Msb:) خَطِئَ, in<br>\
religion; and ↓ اخطأ, in calculation [&amp;c.]: (As,<br>\
M, TA:) or, accord. to Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, (TA,) you<br>\
say, خَطِئَ فِى دِينِهِ, (K, TA, [in a MS. copy of<br>\
the K and in the CK, * فى ذَنْبِهِ,]) and ↓ اخطأ,<br>\
meaning he pursued a wrong way in his religion,<br>\
intentionally or otherwise: (K, TA:) or خَطِئَ<br>\
signifies he committed an act of disobedience<br>\
intentionally; (Msb, TA;) so accord. to the<br>\
&#39;Ináyeh, and the like is said in the A; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓اخطأ, he did wrong, meaning to do<br>\
right: (Az, Msb, TA:) [and this distinction is<br>\
agreeable with general usage:] accord. to AHeyth,<br>\
you say, خَطِئْتَ بِمَا صَنَعْتُهُ [Thou didst wrong, in<br>\
that which thou didst,] intentionally; and ↓أَخْطَأْتَ<br>\
مَا صَنَعْتَهُ [or بِمَا صنعتة or فِيمَا صنعته Thou didst<br>\
wrong, in that which thou didst,] unintentionally.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 4, in two places.<br>\
-A2- خَطَأَتِ<br>\
القِدْرُ بِزَبَدِهَا, aor.<br>\
خَطَاَ, (tropical:)  The cooking-pot threw up<br>\
its froth, or foam, or scum, (K, TA,) in boiling.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
خطّأهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَخْطِئَةٌ and تَخْطِىْءٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) He said to him, أَخْطَأْتَ [meaning Thou<br>\
hast done wrong, or committed a mistake or an<br>\
error]: (S, Msb, K:) or he pronounced him, or<br>\
asserted him, to be doing wrong, or committing a<br>\
mistake or an error. (Msb.) You say, إِنْ<br>\
أَخْطَأْتُ فَخَطِّئْنِى [If I do wrong, &amp;c., tell me<br>\
that I have done so]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He made it<br>\
to miss: so in the saying, خَطَّأَ اللّٰهُ نَوْءَهَا God<br>\
made, or may God make, its [i. e. a land&#39;s] star,<br>\
or asterism, to miss; so that the rain which the<br>\
star or asterism should have brought did not, or<br>\
shall not, fall upon it. (TA.) This was [also]<br>\
said by I&#39;Ab [in a tropical sense] with reference<br>\
to a woman, as an imprecation, in disapproval of<br>\
her conduct. (Mgh.) As some relate this saying,<br>\
the verb is خَطَّى, (Mgh, TA,) and the meaning,<br>\
God made, or may God make, its [rain-giving]<br>\
star or asterism, to pass it over, and not send<br>\
rain upon it: and in this case it may be, (TA,)<br>\
or it is, (Mgh,) from خَطِيطَةٌ, signifying “ a land<br>\
not rained upon (Mgh, TA) between two lands<br>\
that have been rained upon; ” (Mgh;) the verb<br>\
being originally خَطَّطَ, and the final ط being<br>\
changed into ى. (Mgh, TA. [See art خط.])<br>\
نَوْء is [here] the sing. of أَنْوَآءٌ meaning the “ Mansions of the Moon,” also called the “ stars, or<br>\
asterisms, of rain. ” (Mgh.) [See more in the<br>\
first paragraph of art. خط: and see also 4 in the<br>\
present art.] Accord. to Fr, خَطَّى السَّهْمَ and<br>\
خَطَّأَهُ are syn. [as meaning He made the arrow<br>\
to pass over, or to miss, the mark]. (TA.) One<br>\
says also, خُطِّئُ عَنْكَ السُّوْءُ [May evil be made to<br>\
miss thee;] i. e. may evil be repelled from thee.<br>\
(ISk.) And خَطَّأَ عَنْكَ السُّوْءُ [app. for ↓تَخَطَّأَ]<br>\
Evil missed thee, or may evil miss thee. (AZ.)<br>\
4<br>\
اخطأ, inf. n. إِخْطَآءٌ and خَاطِئَةٌ: see 1, in<br>\
eight places. أَخْطَيْتُ, for أَخْطَأْتُ, should not be<br>\
said: (S:) it is a word of weak authority; or a<br>\
mispronunciation: (K:) but some use it; (S,<br>\
Sgh, TA;) because a change of this kind is generally allowed by some of the writers on inflection. (TA.) See also 5.<br>\
-A2-  اخطأهُ, (S, K,) which<br>\
signifies, He [or it] missed, or failed of hitting,<br>\
it [or him], (TA,) and ↓تخاطأهُ (S, K) and<br>\
↓تخطّأهُ (K) and لَهُ ↓تخطّأ (TA) [and ↓خَطِئَهُ,<br>\
as will be seen from what follows,] are syn. (S,<br>\
K, TA.) [See also 2, last sentence.] You say,<br>\
اخطأ الرَّامِى الغَرَضَ The archer, or thrower,<br>\
missed the mark; or failed of hitting it. (TA.)<br>\
And اخطأهُ السَّهْمُ The arrow [missed it, or him,<br>\
or] passed beyond it, or him: and you may also say,<br>\
أَخْطَاهُ, suppressing the ء (Msb.) And اخطأ<br>\
الطَّرِيقَ [He missed the way; or] he deviated<br>\
from the way. (TA.) And اخطأ نَوْؤُهُ [(assumed tropical:)  His star,<br>\
or asterism, missed]; said of him who has sought<br>\
an object of want and not succeeded in attaining<br>\
it: (TA:) and to a person in this case one says,<br>\
اخطأ نَوْؤُكَ [(assumed tropical:)  Thy star, or asterism, has missed].<br>\
(Mgh. [See also 2.]) And اخطأهُ The<br>\
right, or due, was, or became, [out of his reach,]<br>\
or far from him. (Msb.) Owfà Ibn-Matar ElMázinee says,<br>\
النَّبْلُ أَحْشَآءَهُ↓تَخَاطَأَتِ<br>\
[meaning The arrows missed his bowels]. (S.)<br>\
And AO, (S,) or A&#39; Obeyd, (TA,) says that<br>\
↓خَطِئَ and اخطأ are syn.; citing, as an ex., the<br>\
saying of Imra-el-Keys,<br>\
يَا لَهْفَ هِنْدٍ إِذْ خَطِئْنَ كَاهِلَا<br>\
(S, TA,) meaning [O the grief of Hind,] when<br>\
they (the troop of horse) missed the sons of<br>\
Káhil; (TA;) خطئن being here used in the<br>\
sense of أَخْطَأْنَ, (S, TA,) which latter, accord. to<br>\
Az, is the more proper in this case. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
مَا أَخْطَأَهُ is an expression of wonder [meaning<br>\
How sinful, or criminal, or intentionally-disobedient, or intentionally-wrongdoing, is he !] from<br>\
خَطِئَ, not from أَخْطَأَ. (S.)<br>\

تَخَطَّاَ see 1, in two places: ―<br>\

sentence; and 4, in two places. ―<br>\

المَسْأَلَةِ He addressed to him the question with the<br>\
desire of causing him to make a mistake: (TA:)<br>\

خَطَأٌ A wrong action; a mistake, or an error;<br>\
contr. of صَوَابٌ; as also ↓خَطَآءٌ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
↓خَطْءٌ: (K:) accord. to some, it is syn. with<br>\
خَطِيْئَةٌ and خِطْءٌ; and is an inf. n. used as a simple subst; but accord. to others, (TA,) it signifies an unintentional fault or offence or disobedience; (K, TA;) a subst. from أَخْطَأَ: (M,<br>\
Msb: [see 1, first sentence:]) and accord. to the<br>\
M, ↓خَطَآءٌ is a subst. from خَطِئ [and therefore<br>\
syn. with خَطِيْئَةٌ accord. to the general acceptation<br>\
of خَطِئَ]. (TA.)<br>\
خطأة [so in the TA, app. خَطْأَةٌ,] A land which<br>\
the rain misses, while it falls upon another near<br>\
it. (TA. [See 2.])<br>\
خَطَآءٌ: see خَطَأٌ, in two places.<br>\
خَطِيْئَةٌ (S, K) and خَطِيَّةٌ, a change of this kind<br>\
being allowable in this and in similar cases, (S,<br>\
TA,) A fault, an offence, or an act of disobedience; (S, K;) or such as is intentional; (K;)<br>\
like ↓خِطْءٌ, (S, K;) which is an inf. n., thus used<br>\
as a subst.; (Msb;) meaning a sin, a crime,<br>\
or an act of disobedience for which one deserves<br>\
punishment: (S:) pl. خَطَايَا, (Lth, S, K,) originally خَطَائِئُ; (Lth, S;) and خَطَائِى also, (K,<br>\
TA, [in a MS. copy of the K خَطَائِئُ,]) or this<br>\
is [anomalous and] incorrect, unless with the<br>\
art. ال, being otherwise خَطَآءٌ; (MF;) and<br>\
خَطَائِىُّ, [an anomalous pl.,] of which Th gives<br>\
an ex. in the following verse, related to him by<br>\

خَطَائِيُّهَا إِنْ أَخْطَأَتْ وَصَوَابُهَا<br>\
[For every man is appointed, in the world to<br>\
come, the recompense of what his soul has prepared, or laid up in store, for him, its wrong<br>\
