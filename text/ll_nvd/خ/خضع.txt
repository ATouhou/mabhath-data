خَضَعَ, aor.<br>\
خَضَعَ, inf. n. خُضُوعٌ (S, Msb, K)<br>\
and خَضْعٌ and خُضْعَانٌ, or خِضْعَانٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
was, or became, lowly, humble, or submissive, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) لَهُ to him, (Msb, TA,) [for instance,]<br>\
to his creditor, (Msb,) or to God; (TA;) as<br>\
also ↓ اختضع, (S, K,) [and ↓ انخضع, (K in art.<br>\
خذأ,)] and ↓ اِخْضَوْضَعَ: (Sgh, K:) خُضُوعٌ is<br>\
nearly the same as خُشُوعٌ, except that the latter is<br>\
mostly used in relation to the voice [or the eyes];<br>\
but the former is used as meaning in the necks:<br>\
(Msb:) or the former is in the body, (&#39;Eyn and<br>\
K in art. خشع,) and signifies the acknowledgment of humility and submission; (&#39;Eyn;) and<br>\
the latter is in the voice and in the eyes. (&#39;Eyn<br>\
and K ubi suprà.) It is said in a trad. respecting<br>\
the [devils&#39;] hearing [the words of the angels]<br>\
by stealth, خُضْعَانًا لِقَوْلِهِ [With submissiveness to<br>\
his saying, or to what he said]; or, accord. to<br>\
one relation, خِضْعَانًا; but it may be a pl. of<br>\
خَاضِعٌ; and accord. to another relation, it is<br>\
خُضَّعًا, which is a pl. of خَاضِعٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He<br>\
was, or became, still, (K, TA,) and tractable, or<br>\
submissive. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He made his words soft to<br>\
a woman; as also ↓ اخضع: (L:) or the latter<br>\
signifies his speech was soft to a woman. (O, K.)<br>\
It is said in the Kur [xxxiii. 32], فَلَا تَخْضَعْنَ<br>\
بِالقَوْلِ Then be ye not soft in speech. (TA.)<br>\
And you say, خَضَعَ لَهَا بِكَلَامِهِ وَخَضَعَتْ لَهُ وَتَطَمَّعَ<br>\
فِيهَا [He was soft to her in speech, and she was<br>\
soft to him, and he became excited to feel an<br>\
eager desire for her, or to lust after her]; (TA;)<br>\
and in like manner, ↓ خَاضَعَها, (K, * TA,) inf. n.<br>\
مُخَاضَعَةٌ, (TA,) [he was soft in his speech to her,<br>\
she being soft in her speech to him.] And خَضَعَا<br>\
بَيْنَهُمَا حَدِيثًا They two (a man and a woman)<br>\
made soft discourse together, saying that which<br>\
excited each to feel an eager desire for, or to<br>\
lust after, the other. (TA from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b4-  خَضَعَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
خَضَعَ, inf. n. خَضْعٌ, [or, as in two copies of the<br>\
S, خَضَعٌ, though it seems that the verb is correctly<br>\
خَضَعَ, not خَضِعَ,] He had a natural stooping of<br>\
the neck: (TA:) and he bent himself, or became<br>\
bent; as also ↓ اخضع. (Zj.) And ↓ اختضع, said<br>\
of a hawk, He lowered his head to make a stoop,<br>\
or to pounce down. (Z, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Hence,] خَضَعَتِ<br>\
الإِبِلُ (tropical:)  The camels strove, or exerted themselves,<br>\
or hastened, in their pace, or going; (K;)<br>\
because, when they do so, they lower their necks.<br>\
(TA.) And ↓ اختضع, (K,) said of a horse,<br>\
(IAar,) [for the same reason,] (assumed tropical:)  He went quickly,<br>\
or swiftly. (IAar, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  خَضَعَ النَّجْمُ (tropical:)  The star,<br>\
or asterism, inclined (S, K, TA) to the place of<br>\
setting, (S, TA,) or to setting: (K, TA:) and in<br>\
like manner, خَضَعَتِ الشَّمْسُ (tropical:)  the sun inclined<br>\
&amp;c.; like خَدَعَت: (TA:) and خَضَعَتْ أَيْدِى<br>\
الكَوَاكِبِ (tropical:)  the stars inclined to setting. (Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Adnán, TA in art. خشع.)<br>\
-A2-  خَضَعَهُ He, or it,<br>\
rendered him still (K, TA) [and submissive:<br>\
see 1]: the verb being both intrans. and trans.<br>\
(TA.) [See also 4.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K,) inf. n. خَضْعٌ<br>\
and خُضُوعٌ, (TA,) He, or it, caused him to have<br>\
a stooping neck; as also ↓ اخضعهُ; (K;) i. e.,<br>\
bent him: (TA:) said of old age. (TK.) Jereer<br>\
says,<br>\
أَعَدَّ اللّٰهُ لِلشُّعَرَآءِ مِنِّى<br>\
صَوَاعِقَ يَخْضَعُونَ لَهُ الرِّقَابَا<br>\
[God hath prepared, for the poets, from me,<br>\
thunderbolts which make the necks to stoop to<br>\
Him]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  خَضَعَ فُلَانًا إِلَى السَّوْءَةِ; in the<br>\
K الى السُّوءِ, but the former is the right; inf. n.<br>\
خُضُوعٌ; (TA;) He, or it, invited such a one to<br>\
that which was foul, abominable, or evil. (K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\

-A2-<br>\
اخضعهُ It (poverty) lowered, humbled, or abased,<br>\
him; (Msb;) [as also ↓ خضّعهُ; for its inf. n.]<br>\
تَخْضيعٌ signifies the rendering lowly, humble, or<br>\
submissive; in Persian, فَرُوتَنْ كَرْدَانِيدَنْ. (KL.<br>\
[But Golius, from the same source, explains the<br>\
verb as signifying “ Submissum humilemque se<br>\
commonstravit. ”]) [Hence,] أَخْضَعَتَنِى إِلَيْكَ<br>\
الحَاجَةُ (Zj, S, TA) Want, or need, [made me<br>\
lowly, humble, or submissive, to thee; or] constrained me to have recourse to thee, and to<br>\
require thine aid. (TA.) ―<br>\

اخضوضع: see 1, first sentence.<br>\
خَضِعٌ A plant bending by reason of softness, or<br>\
tenderness: ISd holds it to be formed after the<br>\
manner of a relative, or possessive, noun, because<br>\
there is no verb [of the measure خَضِعَ] to which<br>\
it may be referred. (TA.) [The regular form, if<br>\
it were a part. n., would be خَاضِعٌ, q. v.]<br>\
خَضْعَةٌ, or ↓ خَضَعَةٌ: see بَضَعَةٌ and بَاضِعٌ.<br>\
خَضَعَةٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
خُضَعَةٌ A man (S) who is lowly, humble, or submissive, to everyone. (S, Sgh, K,) ―<br>\
-b2-  And One<br>\
who overcomes, or subdues, his adversaries, or<br>\
opponents, (K, TA,) and humbles and abases<br>\
them. (TA.)<br>\
خَضُوعٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
خَاضِعٌ Lowly, humble, or submissive; (Msb;)<br>\
and ↓ خَضُوعٌ signifies the same: (S, K:) [or<br>\
rather the latter is an intensive epithet, signifying<br>\
very lowly, &amp;c.:] the pl. of the former is خَاضِعُونَ<br>\
and خُضَّعٌ and خُضْعَانٌ, or خِضْعَانٌ: (TA:) [respecting the last two of which, see 1, second sentence:] and the pl. of ↓ خَضُوعٌ is خُضُعٌ; (S, K;)<br>\
as in the phrase قَوْمٌ خُضُعُ الرِّقَابِ [A people, or<br>\
company of men, very submissive in the necks].<br>\
(S.) It is said in the Kur [xxvi. 3], فَظَلَّتْ أَعْنَاقُهُمْ<br>\
لَهَا خَاضِعِينَ And their necks shall continue, the<br>\
pret. being used in the sense of the aor., meaning<br>\
تَدُومُ, (Jel,) submissive to it: (Jel, * TA:) the<br>\
original of the phrase is فَظَلُّوا لَهَا خَاضِعِينَ; and<br>\
اعناق is redundantly inserted to show the place of<br>\
خُضُوع, and the predicate is left in its original<br>\
state: (Bd:) or as the خضوع is only that of the<br>\
اعناق, it is allowable to make the predicate relate<br>\
to [the pronoun هم, which is] the complement of<br>\
the latter word: (Sb, Kh:) or since the خضوع<br>\
is ascribed to the necks but really belongs to the<br>\
persons, the epithet has that form of pl. which is<br>\
proper to rational beings: (Jel: [and the like is<br>\
said by Bd:]) or اعناقهم means their chiefs: or<br>\
their companies: but there is another reading<br>\
[which is literally grammatical], namely خَاضِعَةً.<br>\
(Bd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The pl. خُضَّعٌ is also applied to Women<br>\
who have been [ or who are] soft in speech, and<br>\
still. (IAar.) [See 1.] ―<br>\
-b3-  نَعَامٌ خَوَاضِعُ [pl. of<br>\
خَاضِعَةٌ] Ostriches inclining their heads towards<br>\
the ground in their places of pasture; and in like<br>\
manner, ظِبَآءٌ [gazelles]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  إِبِلٌ خَوَاضِعُ<br>\
(tropical:)  Camels striving, or exerting themselves, or<br>\
hastening, in their pace, or going; because, when<br>\
they do so, they lower their necks. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
مَنْكِبٌ خَاضِعٌ and ↓ أَخْضَعُ A low, or depressed,<br>\
shoulder-joint. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  نُجُومٌ خَوَاضِعُ (tropical:)  Stars<br>\
inclining to setting, or to their places of setting.<br>\
(A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Inviting to that which is foul, abominable, or evil. (TA.)<br>\
أَخْضَعُ Content with abasement; fem. خَضْعَآءُ.<br>\
(Lth, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Having a natural stooping of the<br>\
neck; (S, K;) applied to a man, (TA,) and to a<br>\
horse, (S, TA,) and a camel, and an ostrich, and<br>\
a gazelle. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also خَاضِعٌ, near the end<br>\
