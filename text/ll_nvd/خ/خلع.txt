The phrase in the Kur [xx. 12], فَاخْلَعْ نَعْلَيْكَ is<br>\
said to be used in its proper sense, [And do thou<br>\
pull off, or put off, thy sandals,] because his<br>\
sandals were of the skin of a dead ass: or, as the<br>\

thy garment and thy boots,” and the like; and<br>\
is tropical: (TA:) or, accord. to some, (assumed tropical:)  make<br>\

of his authority; or removed him from his office;<br>\
or dismissed him]. (S, TA.) But IF says, This<br>\

that [خَلَعَهُ signifies, in a case of this kind, (tropical:)  He<br>\
threw off his allegiance to him; or forsook obedience to him; like another phrase, mentioned<br>\
above; and] one does not say, [or seldom says,]<br>\

خَلَعَ امْرَأَتَهُ, (Az, S, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. خُلْعٌ, with<br>\
damm, (S, K, *) or this is a simple subst., (Az,<br>\

TA,) and some add خِلَاعٌ; (TA;) and ↓ خالعها,<br>\
(Az, TA,) inf. n. مُخَالَعَةٌ; (K;) [and خِلَاعٌ seems<br>\

a gift, or a compensation, from her, (K, accord.<br>\
to different copies; some having بِبَذْلٍ; and<br>\
others, بِبَبَدَلٍ;) or from another: (K:) because<br>\
the wife is [as] a garment to the husband, and the<br>\
husband to the wife, (Az, Mgh, Msb, TA,) as is<br>\
said in the Kur ii. 183: (Az, TA:) [it is also<br>\
said that] ↓ تَخَالُعٌ is syn. with خُلْعٌ: (K:) [but<br>\
see 6, below:] and اِخْلَعْهَا, occurring in a trad.,<br>\
is explained as signifying Divorce thou her, and<br>\
quit her. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b15-  خَلَعَهُ أَهْلُهُ (tropical:)  [His family cast<br>\
him off, repudiated him, or renounced him;] so<br>\
that if he committed a crime, or an offence rendering liable to punishment, they should not be<br>\
prosecuted for it. (S, TA.) In the Time of Ignorance, when one said, (K, TA,) proclaiming in<br>\
the fair, or festival, (TA,) يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ هٰذَا ابْنَى<br>\
قَدْ خَلَعْتُهُ, (K, * TA,) meaning [O men, this, my<br>\
son, I cast off, repudiate, or renounce, him, or]<br>\
I declare myself to be clear of him; so that if he<br>\
commit a crime, or an offence rendering him<br>\
liable to punishment, I am not responsible; and<br>\
if a crime, or an offence rendering liable to<br>\
punishment, be committed against him, I will<br>\
not pursue [for redress, or retaliation]; (TA;)<br>\
he was not punished afterwards for any such act<br>\
committed by him: (K, TA:) this was when the<br>\
person doing so feared some foul action or treachery from his son: and in like manner, they<br>\
said, إِنَّا قَدْ خَلَعْنَا فُلَانًا [Verily we cast off, &amp;c.,<br>\
such a one]. (TA.) In like manner, also, خَلَعُوهُ,<br>\
inf. n. خَلْعٌ, signifies (tropical:)  [They cast him off, repudiated him, or renounced him, or] they declared<br>\
themselves to be clear of him; meaning a confederate; so that they should not be punished for<br>\
a crime, or an offence rendering liable to punishment, committed by him, nor should he be punished<br>\
for such an act committed by them. (IAth, L.)<br>\
In the same sense the verb is used in the saying,<br>\
نَخْلَعُ وَنَتْرُكُ مَنْ يَفْجُرُكَ [We repudiate, or renounce, or] we declare ourselves clear of, and<br>\
forsake, him who disobeys, or opposes, Thee:<br>\
(Mgh, TA:) or نَخْلَعُ وَنَهْجُرُ مَنْ يَكْفُرُكَ we hate,<br>\
and [repudiate, or renounce, or] declare ourselves<br>\
clear of, [and forsake,] him who denies, or disacknowledges, thy favour, or who is ungrateful,<br>\

or estranged [from his family]; syn. تَبَاعَدَ:<br>\
