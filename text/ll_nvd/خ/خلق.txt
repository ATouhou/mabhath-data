خَلْقٌ signifies The act of measuring; or determining the measure, proportion, or the like, of<br>\
a thing; and the making a thing by measure, or<br>\
according to the measure of another thing; or<br>\
proportioning a thing to another thing; syn.<br>\
تَقْدِيرٌ: (S, Msb, K, TA, and Bd in ii. 19:) this<br>\
is the primary meaning. (Msb, TA, and Bd ubi<br>\
suprà.) You say, خَلَقَ الأَدِيمِ, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
خَلُقَ, (S, TA,) inf. n. خَلْقٌ (JK, S, Msb, K)<br>\
and خَلْقَةٌ, (K,) He measured, or proportioned,<br>\
(قَدَّرَ,) the hide, and sewed it: (K:) or he measured, or proportioned, (قدّر,) the hide, (JK, S,<br>\
Msb, K,) لِمَا يُرِيدُ [for, or to, that which he desired to make of it], (JK, * TA,) or لِلسِّقَآءِ [for,<br>\
or to, the skin for water or milk that he desired<br>\
to make], (Msb,) before cutting it; (S, K, TA;)<br>\
he measured it (قَاسَهُ) to cut from it a water-bag,<br>\
or a water-skin, or a boot: (TA:) and in like<br>\
manner, خَلَقَ النِّطَعَ he measured, &amp;c., the نطع<br>\
[q. v.]: when one cuts it, one says, فَرَاهُ. (K.)<br>\
And خَلَقَ النَّعْلَ He determined the measure of<br>\
the sandal, or proportioned it; (قَدَّرَهَا;) and<br>\
made it by measure. (Ksh and Bd in ii. 19.)<br>\
Hence the saying of Zuheyr, (S,) praising Herim<br>\
Ibn-Sinán, (TA,)<br>\
وَلَأَنْتَ تَفْرِى مَا خَلَقْتَ وَبَعْ(??)<br>\
(??)ضُ القَوْمِ يَخْلُقُ ثُمَّ لَا يَفْرِى<br>\
[(assumed tropical:)  And thou indeed cuttest what thou hast measured; but some of the people measure, then will<br>\
not cut]: (S, TA:) i. e., when thou determinest<br>\
upon a thing thou executest it; but others determine upon that which they do not execute. (TA.)<br>\
And El-Hajjáj said, مَا خَلَقْتُ إِلَّا قَرَيْتُ وَعَدْتُ<br>\
إِلَّا وَفَيْتُ [(assumed tropical:)  I have not measured unless I have<br>\
afterwards cut, and I have not promised unless<br>\
I have afterwards performed]. (S.) أَخْلُقُ لَكُمْ<br>\
مِنَ الطِّينِ كَهَيْئَةِ الطَّيْرِ, in the Kur iii. 43, means<br>\
I will form for you, (Jel,) or I will make according to its proper measure (أُقَدِّرُ) for you,<br>\
(Ksh, Bd,) and will form, (Bd,) of clay, a thing like<br>\
the form of the bird, or of birds. (Ksh, Bd, Jel.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] it signifies also The bringing a thing<br>\
into existence according to a certain measure, or<br>\
proportion, and so as to make it equal [to another<br>\
thing], or uniform [therewith]: (Ksh and Bd in<br>\
ii. 19:) or the originating, or producing, [a<br>\
thing] after a pattern, or model, which one has<br>\
devised, not after the similitude of anything preexisting: this is another meaning which it has in<br>\
the [classical] language of the Arabs. (TA.) As<br>\
the act of God, it signifies The originating, or<br>\
bringing into being or existence, anything, not<br>\
after the similitude of anything pre-existing:<br>\
(TA:) [and the creating a thing; and thus it is<br>\
generally best rendered; as meaning the bringing<br>\
into existence from a state of non-existence: for]<br>\
خَلَقَ اللّٰهُ الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. خَلْقٌ, means God brought<br>\
the thing into existence (Mgh, * TA) after it had<br>\
not been: (TA:) [or خَلْقٌ, as the act of God,<br>\
signifies the creating out of nothing: for it is said<br>\
that] أُعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ, in the Kur ii. 19,<br>\
means [Serve ye your Lord] who brought you<br>\
into existence when ye were nothing. (Jel. [But<br>\
in other passages of the Kur (vi. 2 &amp;c.) it is said<br>\
that God created (خَلَقَ) mankind of clay.])<br>\
Accord. to the A, خَلَقَ اللّٰهُ الخَلْقَ is a tropical<br>\
phrase, meaning (tropical:)  God brought into existence the<br>\
creation, or created beings, or mankind, according<br>\
to a predetermination (تَقْدِير) required by wisdom. (TA.) You say, هٰذِهِ خَلِيقَتُهُ الَّتِى خُلِقَ عَلَيْهَا<br>\
and خُلِقَهَا and الَّتِى خُلِقَ: see خُلُقٌ. (Lh.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence, also,] خَلَقَ, (S, Msb, K, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
خَلْقٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He fabricated speech, or a saying<br>\
or sentence, &amp;c.: (K, * TA:) (tropical:)  he forged (S,<br>\
Msb, K, TA) a saying, (Msb,) or a lie, or a<br>\
falsehood; (S, K, TA;) as also ↓ اختلق (S, Msb,<br>\
K) and ↓ تخلّق. (S, K.) The Arabs say, حَدَّثَنَا<br>\
فُلَانٌ بِأَحَادِيثِ الخَلْقِ (tropical:)  Such a one related to us<br>\
fictitious tales or stories, such as are deemed<br>\
pretty, or such as are told by night [for entertainment]. (TA.) And it is said in the Kur<br>\
[xxvi. 137], accord. to one reading, إِنْ هٰذَا إِلَّا<br>\
خَلْقُ الأَوَّلِينَ, meaning (tropical:)  This is nought but the<br>\
lying, and forging, of the ancients. (TA.) And<br>\
in the same [xxxviii. 6], ↓ إِنْ هٰذَا إِلَّا اخْتِلَاقٌ<br>\
(tropical:)  This is nought but forging, and lying. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  خَلَقَهُ, (K,) inf. n. خَلْقٌ, (TA,) also signifies<br>\
He made it smooth; (K;) and so ↓ خلّقهُ;<br>\

of anything that has been made smooth one says,<br>\
خُلِّقَ: (TA:) he made it equable, or even;<br>\
namely, wood, or a stick; and so ↓ خلّقهُ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. تَخْلِيقٌ. (TA.)<br>\

said of a woman, (JK, K,) She had [a goodly]<br>\
body and make: (JK:) or she was, or became,<br>\

instead of حَسُنَ خَلْقُهَا, is put حَسُنَ خُلُقُها, meaning She was, or became, good in nature, &amp;c.])<br>\

خَلُقَ, (K,) inf. n. خُلُوقَةٌ<br>\

It (a thing) was, or became, smooth, (JK, K,<br>\
TA,) and equable, or even. (TA.) [See also 12.<br>\
And it seems that one says, خَلِقَتِ الصَّخْرَةُ, inf. n.<br>\
خَلَقٌ, q. v. infrà, meaning The rock was free from<br>\
crack or fracture.] ―<br>\

worn out; as also ↓ اخلق, (JK, S, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
إِخْلَاقٌ; (JK, TA;) and ↓ اخلولق. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence,] دِيبَاجُهُ ↓ اخلق [lit.] His face became<br>\
worn out; meaning (tropical:)  it became used for mean<br>\

below]. (S, K.) You say, خَلُقَ لذٰلِكَ [and بِذٰلِكَ<br>\
(see خَلِيقٌ) He was, or became, adapted, disposed, &amp;c., for that]; as though he were one of<br>\
those in whom that was reckoned to be, and in<br>\
whom the symptoms, signs, or tokens, thereof<br>\

بِأَنْ يفعل ذلك and لِأَنْ يفعل ذلك and مَنْ أَنْ<br>\
يفعل ذلك He was, or became, adapted, &amp;c., to do<br>\

Also, (S, K,) inf. n. تَخْلِيقٌ, (K,) He rubbed him<br>\
over with خَلُوق [q. v.]: (S:) or he perfumed him:<br>\
(K:) or خلّقهُ بِخَلُوقٍ he perfumed him with<br>\
خلوق (TA.) And خَلَّقْتُ المَرْأَةَ بِالخَلُوقِ [I<br>\

الكَافِرَ, (TA,) [Act thou with reciprocal sincerity<br>\
towards the believer, and comport thyself with<br>\

nature, &amp;c. See also 3 in art. خلص, where<br>\
a similar saying is mentioned.]<br>\

-b2-<br>\
Also He had old and worn-out garments. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اخلقهُ He wore it out; namely, a garment;<br>\
the verb being trans. as well as intrans. (S, Msb,<br>\
K.) [Hence,] اخلق الدَّهْرُ الشَّىْءَ (assumed tropical:)  Time wore out,<br>\
or wasted, the thing. (TA.) [Hence also,] one<br>\
says to the beggar, أَخْلَقْتَ وَجْهَكَ (tropical:)  (TA) [lit.<br>\
Thou hast worn out thy face;] meaning (tropical:)  thou<br>\
hast used thy face for mean service [so that it has<br>\
lost its grace, or has become disgraced]: and in<br>\
like manner one says, أُخْلِقُ لَهُ دِيَبَاجَتِى, i. e.<br>\
وَجْهِى: and يُخْلِقُ دِيبَاجَتَيْهِ (tropical:)  He uses his face for<br>\
mean service by begging. (Har pp. 15 and 476.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K,) or اخلقهُ ثَوْبًا, (S,) He clad him<br>\
with an old and worn-out garment. (S, K.) And<br>\
اخلقِنى ثَوْبَهُ He gave me his old and worn-out<br>\
garment. (JK.) And some say, اخلقهُ خَلَقًا He<br>\
gave him an old and worn-out garment. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And إِخْلَاقٌ الثَّوْبِ also signifies The cutting<br>\
out of the garment: whence the saying, to UmmKhálid, أَبْلِى وَأَخْلِقِى [Wear out, and cut out<br>\
new]; or, as some relate it, وَأَخْلِفِى, i. e., “and<br>\

-A3-<br>\
مَا أَخْلَقَهُ and أَخْلِقْ بِهِ [have both of the following<br>\
significations; though it is said that] the former<br>\

-b2-  تخلّق بِغَيْرِ خُلُقِهِ means He affected a<br>\
خُلُق [or nature, &amp;c.,] that was not his own. (S,<br>\
K.) And تخلّق بِكَذَا He feigned such a thing, it<br>\
not being in his nature, or not being created in<br>\
him. (TA.) And تخلّق لِلنَّاسِ بِمَا لَيْسَ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ,<br>\
occurring in a trad., [He affected, to men, a nature, &amp;c., that did not belong to him; or] he pretended [to men] that there was in his nature فِى<br>\
خُلُقِهِ) that which was contrary to his real intention; (Mbr, TA;) or that which was contrary<br>\

اخلولق, said of the back (مَتْن) of a horse,<br>\
It was, or became, smooth; (K;) [like خَلِقَ and<br>\
خَلُقَ; or very smooth; for] the verb is of a form<br>\
intensive in signification. (TA. [See its part. n.,<br>\
مَخْلَوْلِقٌ, below.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Said of a رَسْم [i. e. a trace,<br>\
or a remain or relic marking the place of a house<br>\
or the like and cleaving to the ground,] It was,<br>\
or became, even with the ground. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
اخلولق السَّحَابُ The clouds became equable, or<br>\

conjoined; or, as some say, they became smooth;<br>\
(TA;) and, (K,) or as some say, (S, TA,) they<br>\

TA;) as though they were rendered smooth: or<br>\
they became collected together after separation,<br>\

خَلْقٌ inf. n. of خَلَقَ. (JK, S, Msb, K, &amp;c.)<br>\
You say رَجُلٌ تَامُّ الخَلْقِ [A man complete, or<br>\
perfect, in respect of make, or proportion, &amp;c.].<br>\
(S, K. * [See also خِلْقَةٌ.]) [In this and similar<br>\
instances,] الخَلْق signifies The fashion of the<br>\
outer man, and its [peculiar] qualities and attributes; like as الخُلُقُ signifies “ the fashion of<br>\
the inner man,” &amp;c. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  الخَلْقُ is also used<br>\
in the sense of ↓ المَخْلُوقُ [meaning What is<br>\
created; the creature]: (TA, and Bd in xxiii. 17,<br>\
&amp;c.:) [and, collectively, the creation; as meaning<br>\
the beings, or things, that are created;] all created<br>\
things: (Bd ubi suprà, &amp;c.:) and [particularly]<br>\
mankind; as also ↓ الخلِيقَةُ: (S, * K:) and mankind and the jinn, or genii, and others: (Jel in<br>\
lv. 9, &amp;c.:) and ↓ الخلِيقَةُ and [its pl.] خَلَائِقُ<br>\
signify the same: you say, هُمْ خَلِيقَةُ اللّٰهِ and<br>\
also هُمْ خَلقُ اللّٰهِ [They are the creatures of God]:<br>\
الخَلْقُ being originally an inf. n.: (S, TA:) and<br>\
Lh mentions [an instance of its having a pl., in]<br>\
the saying, لَا وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الخُلُوقَ مَا فَعَلْتُ كَذَا,<br>\
meaning [No, by Him who created] all creatures,<br>\
[I did not such a thing.] (TA.) In the saying,<br>\
فَلَيُغَيِّرُنَّ خَلْقَ اللّٰهِ, in the Kur [iv. 118, lit. And<br>\
they shall alter the creature of God], some say<br>\
that castration is meant: (TA: [and Bd includes,<br>\
with this, other unnatural actions:]) or the meaning is, the religion of God; (Bd, Jel, TA;)<br>\
accord. to El-Hasan and Mujáhid. (TA.) And<br>\
لَا تَبْدِيلَ لِخَلْقِ اللّٰهِ, in the Kur [xxx. 29], means,<br>\

or altering,] of the religion of God. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
خَلْقٌ also signifies Anything made smooth. (TA.)<br>\
[See also مُخَلَّقٌ.]<br>\
خُلْقٌ: see خُلُقٌ, in four places.<br>\
خَلَقُ inf. n. of خَلِقَ: as such, signifying The<br>\
being smooth [&amp;c.]. (JK, S. *) [As such also,]<br>\
in a rock, Freedom from crack or fracture. (S,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And, as such,] The being old, and worn<br>\
out. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, used as an epithet,] Old,<br>\
and worn out: (S, Msb, K:) [and as an epithet<br>\
in which the quality of a subst. is predominant;<br>\
meaning an old and worn-out garment or piece of<br>\
cloth:] pl. خُلْقَانٌ (S, K) and أَخْلَاقٌ. (S, * K, *<br>\
TA.) And [as an epithet] it is masc. and fem.;<br>\
(S, K;) because it is originally an inf. n., the<br>\
inf. n. of أَخْلَقُ meaning “ smooth,” (S,) [or<br>\
rather of خَلِقَ meaning “ it was, or became, old,<br>\
and worn out; ” although it has pls.; and] IB<br>\
mentions an instance of its dual, خَلَقَانِ: (TA:)<br>\
Ks says, We have not heard them say, خَلَقَةٌ in<br>\
any instance: (Lh, TA:) Fr says that it is without ة [as a fem. epithet] because it was originally<br>\
used as a prefixed noun; for one said, أَعْطِنِى<br>\
خَلَقَ جُبَّتِكَ and خَلَقَ عِمَامَتِكَ [lit. meaning Give<br>\
thou to me what is old, and worn out, of thy<br>\
جبّة and of thy turban]; but Ez-Zejjájee says<br>\
that this is nought. (TA.) You say ثَوْبٌ خَلَقٌ<br>\
[An old and worn-out garment or piece of cloth],<br>\
and مِلْحَفَةٌ خَلَقٌ [an old and worn-out outer<br>\
wrapping garment]: (S:) also رُمَّةٌ خَلَقٌ [an old<br>\
and worn-out piece of rope]: and دَارٌ خَلَقٌ [an<br>\
old and decayed house]: and جِسْمٌ خَلَقٌ [an old<br>\
and wasted body]. (TA.) One says also ثَوْبٌ<br>\
أَخْلَاقٌ, meaning A garment, or piece of cloth,<br>\
altogether, or wholly, old and worn out; (Fr, S,<br>\
K;) every portion of it being خَلَق; (Fr;) like<br>\
as they said بُرْمَةٌ أَعْشَارٌ &amp;c.: (S:) and in like<br>\
manner, مُلَآءَةٌ أَخْلَاقٌ. (IAar.) And Ks mentions<br>\
the saying, أَصْبَحَتْ ثِيَابُهُمْ خُلْقَانًا وَ خَلَقُهُمْ جُدُدًا<br>\
[Their garments became old, and worn out; and<br>\
their old and worn-out garments became replaced<br>\
by new]; with the sing. [in the latter clause] in<br>\
the place of the pl. خُلْقَان: (TA:) or جُدُدًا may<br>\
be here put for جَدِيدًا. (L in art. جد.) In the<br>\
phrase ↓ مِلْحَفَةٌ خُلَيْقٌ [An outer wrapping garment<br>\
that is a little, or somewhat, old, and worn out],<br>\
the dim. is without ة because it is [the dim. of]<br>\
an epithet [applied without ة to a fem. n.], and ة<br>\
is not affixed to the dims. of epithets [of this<br>\
kind]: it is like نُصَيُفٌ dim. of نَصَفٌ an epithet<br>\
applied to a woman. (S, K. * [See Lumsden&#39;s<br>\
Arab. Gram. p. 623: but some of the grammarians consider these instances as anomalous.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  بَاعَهُ بِيعَةَ الخَلَقِ, and بَيْعَ ذِى الخَلَقِ, the<br>\
latter as used by a poet, [lit. He bought it, or sold<br>\
it, (app. the former,) as one buys, or sells, the old<br>\
and worn-out garment, like as we say “ dogcheap,” and “ cheap as dirt ”], are phrases mentioned, but not explained, by IAar, who cites the<br>\
following saying:<br>\
أَبْلِغْ فَزَارَةَ أَنِّى قَدْ شَرَيْتُ لَهَا<br>\
مَجْدَ الحَيَاةِ بِسَيْفِى بَيْعَ ذِى الخَلَقِ<br>\
[app. meaning Tell thou Fezárah that I have<br>\
purchased for them life-long glory (lit. the glory<br>\
of life), with my sword, as cheaply, i. e as easily,<br>\
as one purchases the old and worn-out garment].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  سَحَابَةٌ خَلَقَةٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
خَلِقٌ [part. n. of خَلِقَ]. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] سحَابَةٌ<br>\
خَلِقَةٌ A cloud in which is a sign, or trace, of<br>\
rain; as also ↓ خَلِيقَةٌ: (S, K:) or a cloud giving<br>\
hope of rain; as also ↓ خَلْقَآءُ; (JK;) both are<br>\
said by IAar to signify the same: (TA:) and<br>\
↓ خَلَقَةٌ [alone, as a subst., or probably سَحَابَةٌ<br>\
خَلَقَةٌ,] a cloud that is equable, or uniform,<br>\
giving hope of rain. (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, K.)<br>\
خُلُقٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ خُلْقٌ (S, K) A nature;<br>\
or a natural, a native, or an innate, disposition<br>\
or temper or the like; syn. سَجِيَّةٌ, (S, Msb, K,<br>\
TA,) and طَبْعٌ; (K, TA;) of which one is<br>\
created: (TA:) and ↓ خِلْقَةٌ signifies [the same;<br>\
i. e.] the فِطْرَةٌ [or nature, &amp;c.,] (S, Msb, K, TA)<br>\
of which a man is created; (TA;) like [خُلُقٌ<br>\
and] ↓ خُلْقٌ: (K, TA: [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
خَلْق:]) and ↓ خَلِيقَةٌ [also] signifies [the same;<br>\
i. e.] the طَبِيعَة [or nature, &amp;c.,] (S, K, TA)<br>\
with which a man is created: (TA:) the proper<br>\
signification of خُلُقٌ is [the moral character; or]<br>\
the fashion of the inner man; i. e. his mind, or<br>\
