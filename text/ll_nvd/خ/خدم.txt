خَدَمَهُ, aor.<br>\
خَدُمَ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
خَدِمَ, (Lh, K,)<br>\
inf. n. خِدْمَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and خَدْمَةٌ, (Lh, K,)<br>\
or, as some say, the latter is the inf. n., and the<br>\
former [though generally used as the inf. n.) is a<br>\
simple subst., (TA,) He served him; did service<br>\
for him; ministered to him; (PS, TA;) syn.<br>\
مَهَنَهُ. (TA.) And خَدَمَ بِطَعَامِ بَطْنِهِ [He served<br>\
for, meaning in return for, the food of his<br>\
belly]. (S and A &amp;c. in art. وغد.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One says<br>\
also, هٰذَا القَمِيصُ يَخْدُمُ سَنَةً (tropical:)  [This shirt will<br>\
serve, or last, a year]: and ثَوْبٌ سَخِيفٌ لَا يَخْدُمُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [A thin, or flimsy, garment, that will not serve<br>\
or last, long; or that will not be serviceable].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
خدّمهُ خِدْمَةً He occupied, or busied, him<br>\
with service. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  خَدَّمَهَا He gave her<br>\
several, or many, female servants. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
[خدّم البَعِيرَ He attached a خَدَمَة, meaning the<br>\
thong thus called, upon the pastern of the camel.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,] تَخْدِيمٌ, [as inf. n. of خُدِّمَ,] in a<br>\
horse, (assumed tropical:)  The having a whiteness (S, Mgh, TA)<br>\
such as is termed تَحْجِيل (S, TA) surrounding<br>\
the pastern of each kind foot, (S, Mgh, TA,)<br>\
above the أَشَاعِر [or extremities next the hoof],<br>\
and stopping short of the shank; (S, TA;) but<br>\
not in the fore foot. (S, Mgh, TA.) [See also<br>\
خَاتَمٌ, last sentence.] When it is in one hind leg,<br>\
the horse is termed أَرْجَلُ. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,<br>\
also,] خَدَّمَهَا زَوْجُهَا (assumed tropical:)  Her husband attired her<br>\
with the خَدَمَة [or anklet]. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اخدمهُ He gave him a servant. (S, K, TA.<br>\
[كَاخْدَمَهُ in the CK is erroneously put for<br>\
فَأَخْدَمَهُ.]) And أَخْدَمْتُهَا I gave her a female<br>\
servant. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  El-Kutb Er-Ráwendee asserts that one says, أَخْدَمْتُهُ لِنَفْسِى, peculiarly;<br>\
[I made him a servant to myself;] but Ibn-Abi-l-Hadeed says, This is of the things that I<br>\
know not. (TA.) [See اختدمهُ.]<br>\
8<br>\
اختدم He served himself; (Lh, K;) as one<br>\
must do who has not a servant. (Lh.)<br>\
-A2-  اختدمهُ<br>\

-b2-  See also what<br>\
next follows, in two places.<br>\
10<br>\
استخدمهُ He asked him to give him a servant; as also ↓ اختدمهُ. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
اِسْتَخْدَمْتُهُ I asked him to serve me; (Msb, TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ اِخْتَدَمْتُهُ: (TA:) [or I took him as my<br>\
servant:] or I made him to serve me. (Msb)<br>\
Accord. to El-Kutb Er-Ráwendee, one says,<br>\
اِسْتَخْدَمْتُهُ لِنَفْسِى and لِغَيْرِى [I took him as a<br>\
servant for myself and for another than myself:<br>\
or I made him to be a servant to myself and to<br>\
another than myself]. (TA.)<br>\
خَدَمٌ: see خَادِمٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and see also خَدَمَةٌ, in<br>\
four places.<br>\
خَدْمَةٌ, (K,) or ↓ خِدْمَةٌ, (JK,) A space, or<br>\
period, (سَاعَةٌ,) of the night (JK, K) or of the<br>\
day: (K:) and خَذْمَةٌ [or خِذْمَةٌ, q. v.,] is a dial.<br>\
var. thereof. (TA.)<br>\
خُدْمَةٌ a subst. signifying (assumed tropical:)  The characteristic<br>\
denoted by the epithet خَدْمَآءُ [fem. of أَخْدَمُ], in<br>\
a sheep or goat; (JK, K, TA;) i. e. whiteness in<br>\
the lower end of the shank. (JK, K,) upon blackness;<br>\
(K;) such whiteness resembling the خَدَمَة, (JK,<br>\
TA,) or being likened to خَدَم, or anklets: (TA:)<br>\
or blackness upon whiteness: &amp;c. (K.) [See<br>\
أَخْدَمُ: and see also خَدَمَةٌ.]<br>\
خِدْمَةٌ, accord. to some, and inf. n. of 1: accord.<br>\
to others, a simple subst. [signifying Service].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also Pay for service: but in this<br>\
sense probably post-classical.]<br>\
-A2-  See also خَدْمَةٌ.<br>\
خَدَمَةٌ A thong, (JK, S, K,) plaited, (TA,)<br>\
thick and strong, like a ring, (JK, K,) which is<br>\
fastened upon the pastern of a camel, (JK, S, K,)<br>\
and to which is attached the سَرِيحَة [or thong] of<br>\
the نَعْل [or leathern shoe with which the foot is<br>\
sometimes protected], (S,) or to which are attached<br>\
the سَرَائِح [or thongs] of the نعل: (K:) [it is the<br>\
n. un. of ↓ خَدَمٌ: and its pl. is خِدَامٌ; as below:<br>\
in the TA, said to be tropical; but this is pro-<br>\
bably a mistake: the other significations here<br>\
following are all tropical:] accord. to AA, [the<br>\
pl.] خِدَامٌ signifies shackles, or hobbles; syn.<br>\
قُيُودٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (S,) (tropical:)  i. q. خَلْخَالٌ [meaning An anklet]; (JK, S, Mgh, K;) because<br>\
sometimes made of thongs, with gold and silver<br>\
affixed thereon: (S:) pl. خِدَامٌ, (S,) and [coll.<br>\
gen. n.] ↓ خَدَمٌ. (Ham p. 612.) كَالْمَمْهُورَةٍ إِحْدَى<br>\
خَدَمَتَيْهَا is a prov. [meaning (assumed tropical:)  Like her who has<br>\
been dowered with one of her two anklets]. (JK,<br>\
TA. [See also مَهْمُورَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence, (assumed tropical:)  A ring<br>\
of white a little above the hoof of a horse &amp;c.]<br>\
You say of a horse, لَهُ خَدَمَتَانِ مِنْ خِلَافٍ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He has a whiteness [or rather a ring of<br>\
white a little above the hoof] in his fore leg [or<br>\
right fore leg] and another in his left fore leg<br>\
[probably a mistake of a copyist for his left kind<br>\
leg]. (TA in art. خلف.) [The coll. gen. n.<br>\
↓ خَدَمٌ is used in the Deewán of the Hudhalees,<br>\
as stated by Freytag, in the sense of (assumed tropical:)  A place<br>\
where the colour differs, like an anklet, on the<br>\
foot: and a whiteness on the foot of a bull, surrounding it like a circle: and خِدَامٌ as meaning<br>\
whiteness: or, as some say, streaks (“striæ”).<br>\
See also خُدْمَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence, also,] (assumed tropical:)  The place<br>\
where each foot comes forth from the trousers.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The shank; (K;) because it is<br>\
the place of the خَدَمَة, i. e. the anklet: (TA:)<br>\
pl. خِدَامٌ and [coll. gen. n.] ↓ خَدَمٌ. (K.) Hence,<br>\
in a trad. of Selmán, كَانَ عَلَى حِمَارٍ وَعَلَيْهِ سَرَاوِيلُ<br>\
وَخَدَمَتاهُ تُذَبْذِبَانِ [He was upon an ass, and upon<br>\
him were trousers, and his shanks were dangling]:<br>\
or, as some say, the meaning here is, the parts<br>\
from which his two feet came forth, of the trousers. (TA.) And one says, أَبْدَتِ الحَرْبُ عَنْ<br>\
خِدَامِ المُخَدَّرَاتِ (tropical:)  [The war made apparent the<br>\
shanks, or the anklets, of the girls that had been<br>\
kept behind the curtains]; meaning the war became vehement. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A ring of<br>\
people; (S, K;) a compact ring thereof: likened<br>\
to the thong described in the first sentence of this<br>\
paragraph. (TA.) Hence the saying of Khálid<br>\
Ibn-El-Weleed, in a letter that he wrote to the<br>\
Satraps of Persia, (TA,) الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِى فَضَّ<br>\
خَدَمَتَكُمْ, meaning [Praise be to God,] who hath<br>\
dispersed, or broken up, your congregation: (S, *<br>\
K, * TA:) for when the thong above mentioned<br>\
is broken, or parted, the سَرَائِح [or thongs of the<br>\
leathern shoe] become loosed, and the shoe falls<br>\
off: so says IAth, and A&#39;Obeyd says the like.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
خَدِمَةٌ A thong: (K:) or a plaited thong.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
خَدُومٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
خَدَّامٌ One who does much service; (TA in the<br>\
present art.;) as also ↓ خَدُومٌ. (TA in art. عقرب.)<br>\
And also applied to A خَادِم [q. v.]. (TA in the<br>\
present art. [It is commonly used in the latter<br>\
sense in the present day: fem. with ة.])<br>\
خَادِمٌ A servant; (S, * Mgh, * Msb, * K, * TA;)<br>\
applied to a young man, (S, Mgh, Msb,) or a<br>\
male: (K:) and, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) as also<br>\
خَادِمَةٌ, (Msb, K,) each in chaste Arabic, (TA,)<br>\
but the latter rare, (Msb,) to a young woman,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb,) or a female: (K:) and خَدَّامٌ<br>\
[q. v.] is also used in the same sense as خَادِمٌ:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. of خَادِمٌ is ↓ خَدَمٌ, (JK, S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) or rather this is a quasi-pl. n., (TA,)<br>\
and خُدَّامٌ (JK, Msb, K) and خَدَمَةٌ, and vulgarly<br>\
خُدْمَانٌ. (TA.) It is said in a trad., of &#39;Abd-Er-Rahmán, (TA,) طَلَّقَ امْرَأَتَهُ فَمَتَّعَهَا بِخَادِمٍ سَوْدَآءَ,<br>\
meaning [He divorced his wife, and gave her on<br>\
that occasion] a black young woman [as a slave].<br>\
(Mgh, * TA.) In the saying فُلَانَةُ خَادِمَةُ غَدًا, the<br>\
word خادمة is not properly an epithet: the meaning is, Such a woman will be a servant to-morrow;<br>\
like as one says حَائِضَةٌ غَدًا. (Msb.)<br>\
[<br>\
خَادِمِيَّةٌ Servitude; or the state, or condition, of<br>\
a servant: a term in common use; and mentioned<br>\
by Freytag on the authority of Meyd.: opposed<br>\
to مَخْدُومِيَّةٌ.]<br>\
أَخْدَمُ i. q. ↓ مُخَدَّمُ, (S, Mgh, K,) as meaning,<br>\
applied to a horse, (tropical:)  Having a whiteness (S,<br>\
Mgh) such as is termed تَحْجِيل (S) surrounding<br>\
the pastern of each kind foot, (S Mgh,) above<br>\
the parts next the hoof, and stopping short of the<br>\
shank; (S;) but not in the fore foot: (S, Mgh:<br>\
[see 2:]) or, so applied, whose تَحْجِيل encircles<br>\
[the pastern] above the أَشَاعِر [or extremities next<br>\
the hoof]: or the latter epithet, so applied, whose<br>\
whiteness passes beyond the pasterns or part thereof.<br>\
(K.) And خَدْمَآءُ, [fem. of أَخْدَمُ,] applied to a<br>\
sheep or goat, (JK, S, K,) i. e. to a شَاة, (S, K,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Having in the lower end of her shank a whiteness<br>\
(JK, K) like the خَدَمَة [or anklet], (JK,) upon<br>\
blackness; or a blackness upon whiteness; and in<br>\
like manner applied to a mountain-goat: (K:)<br>\
or having white shanks; (AZ, S, K;) like<br>\
حَجْلَآءُ; [but see this latter word;] and so<br>\
↓ مُخَدَّمٌ applied to a mountain-goat: (S:) or<br>\
having one white shank; the rest of her being<br>\
black. (K.)<br>\
مُخَدَّمٌ [pass. part. n. of 2, q. v.]. You say قَوْمٌ<br>\
مُخَدَّمُونَ A people, or party, having many servants and other dependents. (S, K.) And in like<br>\
manner مُخَدَّمَةٌ is applied to a woman. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And مُخَدَّمَةٌ (tropical:)  A woman attired, or adorned,<br>\
with anklets. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also أَخْدَمُ, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
-A3-  And مُخَدَّمٌ and ↓ مُخَدَّمَةٌ (S, K)<br>\
The place of the thong [called خَدَمَة] (K, TA)<br>\
in the leg of the camel: (TA: [there said to be<br>\
above the كَعْب; but this is a mistake:]) and<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  the place of the anklet [so called] (K, TA) in<br>\
the shank of a woman: (TA:) the place of the<br>\
خِدَام in the shank: (S:) the place of the خَدَمَ;<br>\
like as مُسَوَّرٌ is the place of the سِوَار. (M in explanation of the former, in art. سور.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And the<br>\
former (tropical:)  The band of the trousers, (JK, K, TA,)<br>\
at the lower part of the leg of a woman: (K,<br>\
TA:) or the band at the lower part of the leg of<br>\
the trousers: (M, TA:) the woman seems to be<br>\
specified in the K because women generally tic<br>\
the legs of the trousers upon the middle [or upper<br>\
part] of the shank, and then make them to fall<br>\
down over it. (TA.)<br>\
مُخَدَّمَةٌ as a subst.: see مُخَدَّمٌ; of which it is<br>\
also the fem.<br>\
مَخْدُومٌ [lit. Served: ―<br>\
-b2-  and hence, A master;]<br>\
a head, or chief: pl. مَخَادِيمُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A<br>\
man having a servant of the jinn, or genii.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
[<br>\
مَخْدُومِيَّةٌ The state, or condition, of a master:<br>\
opposed to خَادِمِيَّةٌ.]<br>\
