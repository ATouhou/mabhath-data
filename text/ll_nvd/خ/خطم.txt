as a gargle; and for the sting or bite of venomous reptiles and the like, and for burns; the<br>\
mixing of its seed with water, or its bruised stem<br>\
or root, causes it to congeal; and its mucilage, extracted by hot water, is beneficial to the sterile<br>\
woman. (K.)<br>\
خِطَامٌ [A kind of halter for a camel; a cord<br>\
of which one end is fastened round the nose and<br>\

(Msb:) or anything that is put upon the nose of<br>\
the camel in order that he may be led thereby:<br>\
(M, K:) or a cord, or rope, which is put upon<br>\
the neck of the camel, and folded [for يُسَمَّى, in<br>\
my copy of the work from which this is taken, I<br>\

rope, which is attached to an iron that surrounds<br>\
the nose and jaws [of the camel]: (JK:) or any<br>\
cord, or rope, that is suspended upon the throat<br>\
of the camel and then tied upon, or over, his nose,<br>\
whether of skin or of wool or of fibres of the<br>\
palm-tree or of hemp: (ISh, TA:) but if of<br>\
plaited leather, it is said to be called جَرِيرٌ: (TA:)<br>\
or the خطام of the camel is a cord, or rope, of<br>\
fibres of the palm-tree, or of [goats&#39;] hair, or of<br>\
flax, at one end of which is put a ring, then the<br>\
other end is tied to it, [i. e. to the rope, as the<br>\
relative pronoun in the original shows, or to some<br>\
part of it,] so that it becomes like a ring [or loop],<br>\
then it is put upon the neck of the camel, and then<br>\
it is folded upon, or over, his nose: what is put<br>\
in the nose, [attached to a ring, or the like,<br>\
therein,] and is slender, is termed زِمَامٌ: (IAth,<br>\
TA:) pl. خُطُمٌ. (Msb, K.) مَنَعَ خِطَامَهُ, said of<br>\

in the “ Tedhkireh: ” (TA:) or such a mark<br>\
upon the side (عُرْض, in the CK عَرْض,) of his<br>\
face, extending to the cheek, (En-Nadr, K, TA,)<br>\
in the form of a line: (En-Nadr, TA:) sometimes the camel is branded with one such mark,<br>\
and sometimes with two; and one says جَمَلٌ<br>\
خِطَامٍ ↓ مَخْطُومُ or خِطَامَيْنِ, making مخطوم to<br>\
govern the gen. case as a prefixed noun; (En-Nadr, K, TA;) and بِهِ خِطَامٌ and خِطَامَان. (En-Nadr, TA.) ―<br>\

-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A horse having a<br>\
whiteness extending from the fore part of his<br>\
