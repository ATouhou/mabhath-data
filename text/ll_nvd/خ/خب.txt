خَبَّ, [sec. pers. خَبَبْتَ,] aor. يَخُبُّ, like يَقْتُلُ,<br>\
inf. n. خَبٌّ; (Msb; [in which خِبٌّ is regarded<br>\
as a simple subst.; but I doubt the correctness<br>\
of this, and of the verb&#39;s being like قَتَلَ;]) He<br>\
(a man) was, or became, deceitful, (Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
wicked, dishonest, or dissimulating, (K, TA,) and<br>\
a mischief-maker: (TA:) [or] he was, or became,<br>\
a great deceiver, or very deceitful, (S, A, L, K,<br>\

(S, * A, * L, TA.) [In the K and TA, neither<br>\
the aor. nor the inf. n. of خَبَّ as signifying “ he<br>\
was, or became, a great deceiver, or very deceitful,” is specified; nor the sec. pers. of the pret.,<br>\
which indicates the form of the aor.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,<br>\
app.,] خَبَّ signifies also He alighted and abode<br>\

thus deceiving passers by]. (K, TA.) ―<br>\

-A2-  خَبَّ, (S, A, K,) aor. يُخُبُّ, with damm, (S,<br>\
A,) deviating from a general rule, accord. to<br>\
which an intrans. v. of this class [of the measure<br>\
فَعَلَ] should be with kesr, (MF,) inf. n. خَبٌّ<br>\
(S, K) and خَبَبٌ and خَبِيبٌ, (S, A, K,) He went<br>\
the pace, or in the manner, denoted by خَبَبٌ as<br>\
explained below; said of a horse; (S, A, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ اختبّ: (Th, K:) and in like manner said<br>\
of a man. (TA.) You say, جَاؤُوا تَخُبُّ بِهِمُ<br>\
الدَّوَابُّ [They came, the beasts going with them<br>\
the pace, or in the manner, termed خَبَبٌ]. (A.)<br>\
And خَبَّ فِى الأَمْرِ, aor.<br>\
خَبُ3َ, inf. n. خَبَبٌ, He<br>\
hastened to begin the affair. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
خَبَّ, (aor. يَخُبُّ, TA, [inf. n. خَبٌّ,]) said of the<br>\
sea, (tropical:)  It was, or became, agitated, or in a state of<br>\
commotion; (T, S, A, K, TA;) the waves dashing together, and the winds whirling; (T, A,<br>\
TA;) such being the case at a certain period,<br>\
when the ships make for the shore, for safety,<br>\
or cast anchor. (T, TA.) You say, أَصَابَهُمُ الخَبُّ<br>\
(tropical:)  Agitation, or commotion, of the sea, with a<br>\
whirling of the winds, befell them: (T, A, TA:)<br>\
or اصابهم خَبٌّ, i. e. خَبَّ بِهِمُ البَحْرُ (tropical:)  The sea<br>\
became agitated, or in a state of commotion, with<br>\
them. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, said of the dust, (tropical:)  It<br>\
rose high: (JK, TA:) and (tropical:)  it ran along. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And said of a plant, or of herbage, (tropical:)  It became<br>\
tall. (JK, S, A, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
خبّب, (JK, S, A, K,) inf. n. تَخْبِيبٌ, (JK,<br>\
TA,) He deceived another; (S, K;) namely,<br>\
another&#39;s young man, or slave: (S:) or deceived<br>\
much or greatly: (Har p. 591:) and he corrupted<br>\
another; (JK, A, TA;) namely, another&#39;s male<br>\

him, (Aboo-Bekr, A,) his friend, (Aboo-Bekr,)<br>\
and his male slave, and his wife. (A.)<br>\

wasted so that there appeared streaks upon the<br>\
skin. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  See also R. Q. 1.<br>\
3<br>\
خابّ: see مُخَابٌّ. [It seems that خابّهُ, if<br>\
used, signifies He acted treacherously towards<br>\
him, and took him unawares.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And [the inf. n.]<br>\
مُخَابَّةٌ signifies The being heavy, or sluggish, and<br>\
holding back from a thing. (JK.)<br>\

or, خِبَّةً, and اختبّ ثَوْبَهُ, (JK,) He took forth<br>\
[or, app., tore] from his garment a piece of ray<br>\
like a fillet. (S.)<br>\

-A3-  خَبْخَبَ عَنِ الظَّهِيرَةِ<br>\
He stayed until the mid-day heat had become<br>\
assuaged, and the air was cool: (K:) or the<br>\

in a trad. relating to the postponement of the<br>\
noon prayers,] خَبْخِبُوا عَنْكُمْ مِنَ الظَّهِيرَةِ, (S,)<br>\
or فِى الظَّهِيرَةِ, (JK, [but the former is more<br>\
probably the correct phrase,]) Stay ye until the<br>\
mid-day heat shall have become assuaged, and<br>\
the air be cool: (JK, S:) it is originally ↓ خَبَّبُوا,<br>\
and is altered therefrom for the purpose of distinction: (S in the present art.:) or originally<br>\
بَخْبِخُوا. (S in art. بخ.)<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَخَبْخَبَ It was, or became, lax,<br>\
flaccid, or flabby: said of a thing in a state of<br>\

leanness. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  تَخَبْخَبَ الحَرُّ The heat became allayed, or assuaged, (K, TA,) somewhat,<br>\
(TA,) in its vehemence. (K, TA.)<br>\

to be originally an inf. n.] and ↓ خِبٌّ (S, L, K)<br>\
[originally an inf. n. accord. to most authorities]<br>\
and ↓ خُبٌّ, (MF,) applied to a man, (S, A, L,<br>\
Msb,) fem. خَبَّةٌ, [which casts doubt upon the<br>\
assertion that خَبٌّ is originally an inf. n., for<br>\

rule would be the same, as well as the sing. and<br>\

tract, between two rugged tracts, in which (i. e.<br>\
in the former of which) are truffles. (AA, K.)<br>\
خُبٌّ: see خَبٌّ.<br>\
-A2-  See also خِبَّةٌ. Hence ثَوْبٌ<br>\
أَخْبَابٌ: see, again, خِبَّةٌ. ―<br>\

حَوَايَا [or winding guts, or intestines into which<br>\

neither fruitful nor unfruitful, between two other<br>\
tracts of land; pl. خُبَبٌ: (AHn:) a tract of<br>\
land between that which abounds with herbage<br>\
and that which is unproductive: (Ru-beh:) a<br>\
narrow tract of soft land abounding with herbage,<br>\

See also خُبَّةٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
