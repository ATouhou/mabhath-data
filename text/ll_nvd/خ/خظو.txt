خَاظٍ Compact, applied to flesh; (TA;) and<br>\
so بَظَا ↓ خَظَا, (S, TA,) likewise applied to flesh,<br>\
(TA,) and to a horse, (AHeyth, TA,) [each]<br>\
originally a verb, (S, TA,) and the latter an imitative sequent; and the fem. ↓ خَظَاةٌ, applied to<br>\
anything; (TA;) and خَظَاةٌ بَظَاةٌ, applied to a<br>\

رِقَابٌ كَالمَوَاجِنِ خَاظِيَاتٌ<br>\
وَأَسْتَاهٌ عَلَى الأَكْوَارِ كُومُ<br>\
[Compact necks like the bleachers&#39; beating implements, and rumps elevated upon the camels&#39;<br>\

أَكَبَّ عَلَى سَاعِدَيْهِ النَّمِرْ<br>\
[She has two compact portions of flesh and sinew<br>\
confining her back-bone, like as appear when the<br>\
leopard falls prostrate upon his fore shanks],<br>\
he means خَظَاتَانِ, suppressing the ن for the purpose of alleviation of the utterance: (Fr, S:) or,<br>\
as some say, he means ↓ خَظَتَا, restoring the ا that<br>\
fell out on account of the concurrence of two<br>\
quiescent letters in the sing. [i. e. خَظَاتْ, for خَظَتْ<br>\
is formed from خَظَاتْ, which is from خَظَوَتْ,]<br>\
when the ت has become movent. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  خَاظٍ<br>\
also signifies Thick, and hard, firm, or rigid:<br>\
(TA:) and [so, or simply] thick, applied to an<br>\
arrow. (AHn, TA.) And one says سَاعِدٌ خَاظِى<br>\
البَضِيعِ [A fore arm, or an upper arm,] full of<br>\
flesh. (IB, TA in art. بضع.) And رَجُلٌ خَاظِى<br>\
البَضِيعِ (As, S in art. بضع) A fat man. (TA in<br>\
that art.)<br>\
