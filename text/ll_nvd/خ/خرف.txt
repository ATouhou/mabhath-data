it means the same as when said of a ewe or she-goat; for] the epithet applied to her in this case<br>\
is ↓ مُخْرِفٌ; (S, K;) but this is more correctly<br>\

knowest that a number such as is termed ذود, of<br>\

them is approved: and in another, النَّخْلَةُ خُرْفَةُ<br>\
الصَّائِمِ, meaning The palm-tree is that of which<br>\
the fruit is eaten by the faster. (TA.) See also<br>\
مَخْرَفٌ, last sentence.<br>\
خَرْفَى The جلبان, (i. e. جُلُبَّان, or جُلْبَان, &amp;c.,<br>\
accord. to different copies of the K, [see art.<br>\
جلب,]) a well-known grain or seed, (AHn, K,)<br>\
of the kind called قَطَانِىّ [i. e. pulse]: (AHn:)<br>\
an arabicized word, from خَرْبَى, (AHn, K,) which<br>\
is Persian; also called خُلَّرٌ. (AHn.)<br>\
خَرْفِىٌّ and خِرْفِىٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\

contraction of the former, (Msb,) and ↓ خِرْفِىٌّ,<br>\
(K,) Of, or relating to, the season called خَرِيف;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) and applied to the rain of that<br>\

the first of the senses explained above. (K.)<br>\

خَرُوفٌ A lamb; syn. حَمَلٌ [q. v.]: (S, Msb:)<br>\
or the male young one of the sheep-kind: or such<br>\
as has pastured, and become strong: (Lth, K:)<br>\
younger than the جَذَع: (Lth, TA:) so called<br>\
because it depastures from this place and this:<br>\
(Msb, TA: [see 1:]) fem. with ة: (K:) pl. (of<br>\
pauc., TA) أَخْرِفَةٌ and (of mult., TA) خِرْفَانٌ.<br>\
(Msb, K, TA.) The latter pl. is sometimes used<br>\
as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Young and ignorant persons; like<br>\
as كِبَاشٌ is used as meaning aged and learned<br>\
persons. (TA.) And hence the prov., كَالْخَرُوفِ<br>\
أَيْنَمَا اتَّكَأَ عَلَى صُوفٍ [Like the lamb: wherever<br>\
he reclines, he reclines upon wool]: (JK, TA:<br>\
but in the latter, اتّكى:) applied to him who leads<br>\
a soft and delicate life. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (sometimes, S,) A colt; the male offspring of a mare;<br>\
when he has attained the age of six months, or<br>\
seven months; (S, K;) a meaning assigned to it<br>\
by As, in the “ Book of the Horse; ” but unknown to Abu-l-Ghowth: (S:) or, until a year<br>\
old: (ISk, K:) it is said by some to be applied<br>\
to a horse: in the L it is said that the خروف of<br>\
horses is such as is brought forth in the [season<br>\
called] خَرِيف: but Khálid Ibn-Jebeleh says that<br>\
it means such as pastures upon the [herbage of<br>\
the season called] خَرِيف: and Suh thinks that it<br>\
is an epithet applied to a horse, and any beast, as<br>\
meaning that depastures the trees and herbage.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
خَرِيفٌ Fresh ripe dates, (K, TA,) or fruits [in<br>\
general], (S, TA,) gathered, or plucked; (S, K,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ مَخْرُوفٌ. (S, TA. See also مَخْرَفٌ,<br>\
last sentence. [And see خُرْفَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,<br>\
(tropical:)  Fresh milk; milk recently drawn from the<br>\
udder. (Hr, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Palm-trees (نَخْلٌ) whereof<br>\
the quantity of the fruit that is upon them is<br>\
computed by conjecture. (K. [See also خَرَائِفُ,<br>\
voce خَرِيفَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  [The autumn;] one of the divisions of the year, (S, Mgh,) the division (Msb)<br>\
[consisting of] three months between the end of<br>\
the قَيْظ [or summer] and the beginning of the شِتَآء<br>\
[or winter], (Lth, K, *) in which the fruits are<br>\
gathered. (Lth, S, Mgh, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And hence,<br>\
(Mgh, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  A year: (Mgh, K, TA:) so in the<br>\
saying, مَنْ صَامَ يَوْمًا فِى سَبِيلِ اللّٰهِ بَاعَدَهُ اللّٰهُ مِنَ<br>\
النَّارِ أَرْبَعِينَ خَرِيفًا أَوْ سَبْعِينَ, i. e. [Whoso fasteth<br>\
a day in the way of God, God will remove him<br>\
from the fire of Hell] to the distance of a journey<br>\
of forty years, or seventy. (Mgh: and similar<br>\
exs. are given in the TA, from three trads.: see<br>\
also an ex. voce إِنَّ.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also The rain of the<br>\
season so called: (S, K:) or the rain, (JK,) or<br>\
the first of the rain, (K,) in the beginning of the<br>\
شِتَآء [or winter], (JK, K,) which comes at the<br>\
time of the cutting off of the fruit of the palmtrees: then follows the وَسْمِىّ, at the coming in of<br>\
the winter; then, the رَبِيع; then, the صَيْف; and<br>\
then, the حَمِيم: so says As: El-Ghanawee says<br>\
that the خريف is between the [auroral] rising of<br>\
الشِّعْرَى [or Sirius, which commenced, in central<br>\
Arabia, about the epoch of the Flight, on the<br>\
13th of July, O. S.,] and the [auroral] setting of<br>\
العَرْقُوَتَانِ [or الفَرْغَانِ, the 26th and 27th of the<br>\
Mansions of the Moon, commencing, in the same<br>\
region and period, on the 8th and 21st of Sept.,<br>\
O. S., and continuing thirteen days]: El-Ghowr<br>\
and Rekeeyeh [? (imperfectly written)] and El-<br>\
Hijáz are all rained upon by the خريف; but Nejd<br>\
is not: AZ says, the first rain is the وَسْمِىّ; the<br>\
follows the شَتَوِىّ; then, the دَفَئِىّ; then, the<br>\
صَيْف; then, the حَمِيم; then, the خَرِيف: and<br>\
therefore the year is made to consist of six<br>\
seasons: accord. to AHn, [who seems in this<br>\
matter to differ from most others,] الخريف is not<br>\
originally the name of the division of the year;<br>\
but the name of the rain of the قَيْظ [or summer];<br>\
and then the season was named thereby. (TA.)<br>\
[See also نَوْءٌ.] ―<br>\
-b7-  [Also The herbage of the season<br>\
so called, or of the rain so called; like as رَبِيعٌ<br>\
signifies the “ herbage of the season, or of the<br>\
rain, so called. ” So in the phrase used by Khálid<br>\
Ibn-Jebeleh (in explaining the word خَرُوف), مَا<br>\
رَعَى الخَرِيفَ Such as pastures upon the خريف.] ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
Also, accord. to AA, (TA,) A rivulet, streamlet,<br>\
or small channel for irrigation. (JK, K, TA.)<br>\
خُرَافَةٌ i. q. خُرْفَةٌ, q. v. (Mgh, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence<br>\
خُرَافَاتٌ meaning Stories that are deemed pretty:<br>\
similar to فُكَاهَةٌ from فَاكِهَةٌ: (Mgh:) [or] خُرَافَةُ<br>\
was the name of a man, (S, Mgh, K,) of [the<br>\
tribe of] &#39;Odhrah, (S, K,) whom the Jinn (or<br>\
Genii) fascinated, (S, Mgh, K,) as the Arabs<br>\
assert, (Mgh,) and carried off, (TA,) and who<br>\
related what he had seen, (S, Mgh, K,) of them,<br>\
when he returned, (Mgh,) and they pronounced<br>\
him a liar, and said, (S, Mgh, K,) of a thing that<br>\
was impossible, (Mgh,) حَدِيثُ خُرَافَةَ [a story of<br>\
Khuráfeh]: (S, Mgh, K:) but it is related of<br>\
the Prophet, that he said, خُرَافَةُ حَقٌّ, (S, Mgh,)<br>\
meaning What Khuráfeh relates [as heard] from<br>\
the Jinn [is true]: (Mgh:) the ر is without<br>\
teshdeed; and the article ال is not prefixed,<br>\
because the word is determinate [by itself], unless one mean thereby خُرَافَاتٌ as signifying fictictious night-stories: (S:) or خُرَافَةٌ signifies a<br>\
fictitious story that is deemed pretty: (Lth, K:)<br>\
[and ↓ أَخَارِيفُ app. signifies the same as خُرَافَاتٌ,<br>\
as though its sing. were أُخْرُوفَةٌ, like as أَسَاطِيرُ<br>\
and أَحَادِيثُ, which have similar meanings, are<br>\
pls. of which the sings. are said to be أَسْطُورَةٌ<br>\
and أُحْدُوثَةٌ:] see 1, last signification.<br>\
خَرُوفَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
خَرِيفَةٌ and ↓ خَرُوفَةٌ A palm-tree (نَخْلَةٌ) of<br>\
which a man gathers, or plucks, the fruit for<br>\
himself and his household; as also ↓ مَخْرَفٌ:<br>\
(AHn:) or a palm-tree which one takes for the<br>\
picking up of its fresh ripe dates: (Sh, O, K:)<br>\
or the latter signifies a palm-tree of which the<br>\
fruit is cut off; being of the measure فَعُولَةٌ in<br>\
the sense of the measure مَفْعُولَةٌ: and the former<br>\
is said to signify one that is set apart for its<br>\
fruit that is [to be] gathered, or plucked: (TA:)<br>\
or a selected palm-tree: (JK:) and its pl. is<br>\
خَرَائِفُ: (JK, TA:) or خَرَائِفُ signifies palmtrees whereof the quantity of the fruit that is<br>\
upon them is computed by conjecture. (AZ, S,<br>\
K. [See also خَرِيفٌ.]) Also, the former, [A<br>\
palm-tree set in the manner described in the<br>\
following explanation:] one&#39;s digging, for a<br>\
palm-tree, in a water-course, or channel of a<br>\
torrent, in which are pebbles, until reaching hard<br>\
ground, and then filling up the hollow with sand,<br>\
and setting the palm-tree therein. (O, K.)<br>\
خَارِفٌ A keeper, or watcher, of palm-tree:<br>\
(K:) pl. خُرَّافٌ. (TA.)<br>\
أَخَارِيفُ: see خُرَافَةٌ; and see 1, last signification.<br>\
مَخْرَفٌ The place of the gathering, or plucking,<br>\
or cutting off, of fruit. (Msb.) A place of<br>\
abode of a people, or party, during their خَرِيف.<br>\
(TA. [It is there added, “as though formed<br>\
from أَخْرَفُوا, by the rejection of the augmentative letter: ” but it is rather to be regarded as<br>\
regularly formed, from خَرَفُوا: see 1.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
A garden; (Mgh, TA;) and so ↓ مَخْرَفَةٌ: (S,<br>\
K:) or a garden of palm-trees; as also ↓ مَخْرِفٌ<br>\
and ↓ مَخْرَفَةٌ: (TA:) a single palm-tree: or a<br>\
few palm-trees, up to ten; more than these being<br>\
termed a بُسْتَان or a حَدِيقَة: (El-Harbee, TA:)<br>\
see also خَرِيفَةٌ: or a small collection of palmtrees, six or seven, which a man purchases for<br>\
the fruit that is [to be] gathered, or plucked: or<br>\
any collection of palm-trees: (L, TA:) or a<br>\
walled garden of palm-trees: (IAth, TA:) or<br>\
palm-trees [absolutely]: (Mgh:) and an avenue<br>\
between two rows of palm-trees, such that one may<br>\
gather, or pluck, the fruit from whichever of them<br>\
he will; (K;) as also ↓ مَخْرَفَةٌ: (Sh, K:) and,<br>\
(S, Mgh, K,) as also ↓ مَخْرَفَةٌ, (S, K,) a road,<br>\
(S, Mgh, K,) such as is conspicuous, clear, or<br>\
open: (K:) pl. مَخَارِفُ. (Mgh, TA.) It is<br>\
said in a trad., عَائِدُ المَرِيضِ عَلَى مَخَارِفِ الجَنَّةِ<br>\
حَتَّى يَرْجِعَ, i. e. The visitor of the sick is as<br>\
though he were in the gardens of Paradise until<br>\
he returns: or upon the palm-trees of Paradise;<br>\
gathering, or plucking, their fruits: or upon the<br>\
roads of Paradise: (Mgh, * TA:) or, as some<br>\
relate it, الجنّةِ ↓ على مَخْرَفَةِ. (TA. [See also<br>\
another explanation, and other readings in what<br>\
follows.]) And it is said in a trad. of &#39;Omar,<br>\
النَّعَمِ ↓ تَرَكْتُكُمْ عَلَى مَخْرَفَةِ, (S,) or تُرِكْتُمْ,<br>\
(TA,) i. e. [I have left you, or ye have been<br>\
left,] upon a conspicuous road, like the road of<br>\
the camels, (As, S, * TA,) which they have trodden<br>\
with their feet so that it has become plainly apparent. (As, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Gathered, or plucked,<br>\
fruit of palm-trees: (As, A &#39;Obeyd, IAmb, K:)<br>\
a correct meaning, though IKt says that the<br>\
proper word in this sense is only مَخْرُوفٌ: it is<br>\
like مَشْرَبٌ and مَطْعَمٌ and مَرْكَبٌ as meaning<br>\
مَشْرُوبٌ and طَعَامٌ مَأْكُولٌ and مَرْكُوبٌ; and<br>\
may signify fresh ripe dates gathered or plucked:<br>\
(IAmb, TA:) pl. as above. (As, &amp;c.) So in the<br>\
former of the two trads. mentioned above accord.<br>\
to As and A &#39;Obeyd: (TA:) and this interpretation<br>\
is corroborated by another reading, i. e., على<br>\
الجنّةِ ↓ خُرْفَةِ: (Mgh:) another reading is, فِى<br>\
الجنّةِ ↓ خِرَافِ: [see خَرَافٌ:] and another, لَهُ<br>\
فِى الجَنَّةِ ↓ خَرِيفٌ, i. e. [The visitor of the sick<br>\
shall have] gathered fruits in Paradise. (TA.)<br>\
مَخْرِفٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مُخْرِفٌ: see 4.<br>\
مِخْرَفٌ The thing in which fruits are gathered;<br>\
(S, Har p. 374;) called by the Arabs خَافَةٌ:<br>\
(Har ib.:) a [basket of the kind called] مِكْتَل,<br>\
(Msb,) or زِنْبِيل, of small size, in which the best<br>\
fresh ripe dates are gathered: (O, K:) pl.<br>\
مَخَارِفُ. (A, TA.) One says, خَرَجُوا إِلَى المَخَارِفِ<br>\
بالمَخَارِفِ, i. e. They went forth to the gardens<br>\
with the baskets (زُبُل) [for gathering fruit]. (A,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (assumed tropical:)  The basket (زنبيل) in which<br>\
the importunate beggar puts his food. (Har ubi<br>\
suprà.)<br>\
مَخْرَفَةٌ: see مَخْرَفٌ, in six places.<br>\
مَخْرُوفٌ: see خَرِيفٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also Rained upon by<br>\
the rain called خَرِيف; pl., applied to men,<br>\
مَخْرُوفُونَ: (TA:) [so, too, applied to a beast:]<br>\
and so, with ة, applied to land (أَرْض). (As, S.)<br>\
مُخَارَفٌ Denied, or refused, good, or prosperity;<br>\
prevented, or withheld, from obtaining good, good<br>\
fortune, or sustenance; (K;) i. q. مُحَارَفٌ; (JK,<br>\
TA;) as also مُجَارَفٌ. (TA.)<br>\
