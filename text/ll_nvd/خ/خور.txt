خَارَ, aor. يَخُورُ, (S, A, Mgh,) inf. n. خُوَارٌ<br>\
(JK, S, A, Mgh, K *) and خَوْرٌ, (JK,) He (a<br>\
bull) uttered his cry; [i. e. lowed, or bellowed;]<br>\
(Lth, JK, S, A, Mgh, K;) this being its primary<br>\
signification: (Er-Rághib:) the inf. n. خوار,<br>\
used agreeably with this explanation, occurs in<br>\
the Kur xx. 90 [and vii. 146]: (S:) it signifies<br>\
the loud crying [i. e. the lowing or bellowing] of<br>\
a cow and of a calf: (Lth:) and the crying [i. e.<br>\
bleating] of sheep, or that of goats, and of gazelles,<br>\
(K,) and of any beast: (Er-Rághib:) and the<br>\
sounding [i. e. whizzing] of arrows: (K:) of any<br>\
of these, you say, خَارَ, aor. and inf. n. as above.<br>\
(TA.) [Hence,] لَهُ صَوْتٌ كَخُوَارِ الثَّوْرِ He has a<br>\
voice like the bellowing of the bull. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And<br>\
hence, (see 10,)] خار عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  He bent, turned, or<br>\
inclined, towards him. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  خار, aor. as above,<br>\
(S, Msb,) inf. n. خُؤُورٌ, (S, K, [for which Golius,<br>\

of a man, (S,) and of anything, (TA,) He, or it,<br>\
was, or became, weak, or feeble, (S, Msb, K,) and<br>\
languid; (S, TA;) as also خَوِرَ, (TA,) aor. يَخْوَرُ,<br>\
(JK,) inf. n. خَوَرٌ; (S, * K, * TA;) and ↓ خِوِّر,<br>\
(JK, TA,) inf. n. تَخْوِيرٌ. (K.) خار and خَوِرَ<br>\

&#39;Omar, لَنْ يَخُورَ قَوِىٌّ مَا دَامَ صَاحِبُهَا بَنْزِعُ وَيَنْزُو,<br>\
meaning A possessor of strength (صَاحِبُ قُوَّةٍ) will<br>\
not be weak as long as he can pull his bow and<br>\
leap to his beast. (TA.) In a camel that is<br>\
drinking, خَوَرٌ denotes, or implies, a quality that<br>\
is praised; i. e. Patient enduring of thirst and<br>\
fatigue: and a quality dispraised; i. e. the lacking patience to endure thirst and fatigue. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also, said of heat, (S, TA,) and of cold, inf. n.<br>\
خُؤُورٌ and خُؤُورَةٌ, (JK,) (tropical:)  It became faint; it<br>\
remitted, or abated; (JK, S, TA;) and so خَوِرَ,<br>\
inf. n. خَوَرٌ; and ↓ خوّر. (TA.) And خار عَنَّا,<br>\

-A3-  خَارَهُ, (JK, S,) inf. n. خَوْرٌ, (S, K,) He hit, or<br>\
hurt, his خَوْرَان, (JK, S, K, *) in thrusting or<br>\

2<br>\

4<br>\
اخارهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. إِخَارَةٌ, (S,) [app., in its&#39;<br>\
primary acceptation, He caused him to utter a<br>\
cry. (See 10.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,] (assumed tropical:)  He bent, turned,<br>\

استخارها [He endeavoured to make her<br>\
(namely, a gazelle, or a wild cow,) to utter her<br>\
cry; or] he uttered a cry in order that she should<br>\
do the same. (TA.) The sportsman, coming to a<br>\
place in which he thinks the young one of a<br>\
gazelle or [wild] cow to be, utters a cry like that<br>\
of her young one; and the mother, hearing it, if<br>\
she have a young one, thinks the cry to be that of<br>\
her young one, and follows the cry. (S, * TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (S, TA,) استخارهُ (tropical:)  He endeavoured to<br>\
make him bend, turn, or incline: (JK, S, A, K,<br>\
TA:) and he called him to him: and he interrogated him; or desired him to speak; syn. اِسْتَنْطَقَهُ:<br>\
namely, a man. (JK.) [استخار المَنْزِلَ is explained in the L and K as meaning اِسْتَنْظَفَهُ: to<br>\
which is added in the TA, كأنّه طلب خيره, with<br>\
the remark that it should therefore properly be<br>\
mentioned in art. خير: but an explanation in the<br>\
sentence immediately preceding, and a verse cited<br>\
below, evidently show that استنظفه is a mistranscription for اِسْتَنْطَقَهُ, and that خيره should be خَبَرَهُ:<br>\
so that the meaning is He interrogated the place<br>\
of abode.] The author of the L cites, as an ex.,<br>\
the saying of El-Kumeyt,<br>\
وَلَنْ يَسْتَخِيرُ رُسُومَ الدِّيَارِ<br>\
لِعَوْلَتِهِ ذُو الصِّبَى المُعوِلُ<br>\
[And he who is affected with youthful amorousness, wailing, will not ask the remains, or traces,<br>\
of the dwellings to reply to his wailing: but for<br>\
لِعَوْلَتِهِ I would rather read بِعَوْلَتِهِ; i. e., will not<br>\
interrogate them with his wailing]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
استخار الضَّبَّ, (K, TA, [in some copies of the K,<br>\
erroneously, الضَّبُعَ,]) and اليَرْبُوعَ, (TA,) He<br>\
placed a piece of wood in the hole of the burrow<br>\
of the [lizard called] ضبّ, (K, TA,) and of the<br>\
jerboa, i. e. in the قَاصِعَآء, (TA,) in order that it<br>\
should come forth from another place, (K, TA,)<br>\
i. e. the نَافِقَآء, so that he might catch it. (TA.)<br>\
Lth falsely assigns the act of الاِسْتِخَارَة to the ضبّ<br>\
and the jerboa. (Az, TA.)<br>\
