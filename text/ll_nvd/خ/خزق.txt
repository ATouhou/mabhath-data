خَزْقٌ inf. n. of 1. (S, * Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [I also<br>\
find in the TA, الخزق ما يثبت والخزق ماينفذ, as<br>\
though meaning that خَزْقٌ signifies A thing that<br>\
becomes fixed or fast: and also a thing that transpierces, or passes through: but these may be loose<br>\
explanations, intended to mean that خَزْقٌ is said<br>\
of that which becomes fixed or fast (as an arrow<br>\
in the body pierced by it), and also of that which<br>\
transpierces, or passes through: see خَسَقَ, of<br>\
which the inf. n., خَسْقٌ, is said to be used in these<br>\
two senses.]<br>\
خَزُوقٌ A she-camel that pierces the ground with<br>\
her toes, (K, TA,) making marks upon it: (TA:)<br>\
or that furrows the ground with her toe turned<br>\
up, as she goes. (K, TA.) [See also خَسُوقٌ.]<br>\

hits, the target; (S, Mgh, K;) and (Mgh, TA)<br>\
transpiercing, or passing through, or that transpierces or passes through, or piercing, or that<br>\
pierces, so that its extremity passes through,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K,) the target [or the object shot at];<br>\
(Msb;) as also خَاسِقٌ: (TA:) pl. خَوَازِقُ. (Msb.)<br>\
And [hence, used as a subst.,] A spear-head:<br>\
(JK, S, K:) and the iron head or blade of an<br>\
arrow &amp;c. (TA.) One says, هُوَ أَمْضَى مِنْ خَازِقٍ<br>\
[He is more penetrating than a spear-head]:<br>\
(S:) and أَنْفَدُ مِنْ خَازِقٍ, which means the same;<br>\
(JK, Meyd;) or more penetrating than a transpiercing arrow: (TA:) the latter is a prov.;<br>\
(Meyd, TA;) applied to him who is penetrating<br>\
in affairs. (Meyd.) And إِنَّهُ لَخَازِقُ وَرَقَةٍ [lit.<br>\
Verily he is a piercer, or transpiercer, of a leaf];<br>\
meaning لَا يُطْمَعُ فِيهِ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  he is a person whom<br>\
one may not hope to overcome]: (IAar, K:) or<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  he is bold and skilful. (K.)<br>\
[<br>\
خَازُوقٌ A stake for impaling a man: but this<br>\
I believe to be post-classical: pl. خَوَازِيقُ.]<br>\

end, (JK,) or having at its end a sharp nail,<br>\
(K,) that is with the seller of full-grown unripe<br>\
dates for date-stones [which are used as food for<br>\
camels]: (JK, K:) he has many مَخَازِق [pl. of<br>\
مِخْزَقٌ]; and a boy comes to him with date-stones,<br>\
which he takes from him on the condition that<br>\
he shall strike with the مخزق a certain number<br>\
of times and have as many of the dates as become<br>\
thus transfixed for him, whether many or few,<br>\
but nothing if he miss. (K.)<br>\
