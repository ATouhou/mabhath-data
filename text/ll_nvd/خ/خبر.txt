عَلِمَهُ; (S, A, Msb;) [generally meaning, with<br>\
respect to its internal, or real, state; like خَبُرَ بِهِ:<br>\
see خُبْرٌ, its simple subst., as distinguished from<br>\
its inf. n.] You say, مِنْ أَيْنَ خَبَرْتَ هَذَا الأَمْرَ,<br>\
(so in a copy of the S,) or خَبِرْتَ, (so in another<br>\
copy of the S, and so in the A, where it is expressly said to be with kesr,) Whence knewest thou<br>\
this thing? (S, A. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  And خَبَرَهُ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
خَبُرَ,<br>\
(S,) inf. n. خُبْرٌ and خِبْرَةٌ, (S, K,) or the latter is<br>\

some good lexicons خُبْرَكَ, (TA, [and so in the<br>\
CK, but this I think to be a mistake, suggested<br>\
by the explanation, which is not literal,]) i. q.<br>\
لَأَعْلَمَنَّ عِلْمَكَ [which properly signifies I will<br>\
assuredly know thy knowledge, or what thou<br>\
knowest, but here means, as is shown by the<br>\
manner in which the phrase that it explains is<br>\
mentioned in the S, I will assuredly try, prove,<br>\
or test, thy state, and so know what thou knowest].<br>\
(S, K.) [Hence, also,] the saying of Abu-dDardà, وَجَدْتُ النَّاسَ اُخْبُرْ تَقْلِهِمْ, (S,) or تَقْلِهِ,<br>\
(A, K,) I found the people to be persons of whom<br>\
it is said thus: [Try, prove, or test, them, or<br>\
him, and thou wilt hate them, or him:] i. e. there<br>\
is not one [of them] but his conduct is hated when<br>\
it is tried, or proved, or tested: (K:) or when<br>\
thou triest, provest, or testest, them, thou wilt<br>\
hate them: the imperative form being used, but<br>\
the meaning being that of an enunciative: (S, A,<br>\
L, B:) [وَجَدْتُ is a verb of the kind called أَفْعَالُ<br>\
القُلُوبِ, which govern two objective complements; therefore اُخْبُرْ تَقْلِهِمْ and اُخْبُرْ تَقْلِهِ are for<br>\
مَقْلِيِّينَ عِنْدَ الخِبْرَةِ and مَقْلِيًّا عند الخبرة.]<br>\

other copies of the K:) and i. q. مُؤَاكَرَةٌ: (K:)<br>\
and ↓ خِبْرٌ is syn. with مُخَابَرَةٌ: (S, K:) it is a<br>\
forbidden practice: (A, Mgh, TA:) it is from<br>\
خَبِيرٌ signifying “ a tiller, or cultivator, of land: ”<br>\
(S, Mgh:) or from خَبَرَ “ he furrowed, or ploughed<br>\
(land) for sowing; ” whence خَبِيرٌ also: (Msb:)<br>\
or from خَبِرَتِ الأَرْضُ “ the land abounded with<br>\
خَبَار: ” or from [the fortress of] خَيْبَر, because<br>\
the Prophet made it to remain in the possession<br>\
of its inhabitants for half of its revenue; and<br>\
therefore it was said, خَابَرَهُمْ. (TA.)<br>\

knew]. (K. [Whether it be meant that اخبر is<br>\
doubly trans. without a particle, in this instance,<br>\
like أَعْلَمَ, or whether خبورة be a quasi-inf. n, is<br>\
not explained.]) One says also, تُخْبِرُ عَنْ مَجْهُولِهِ<br>\
مَرْآتُهُ (tropical:)  [His aspect acquaints one with his unknown<br>\
