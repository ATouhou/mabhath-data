خَشَبَ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
خَشِبَ, (K,) inf. n. خَشْبٌ,<br>\
(TA,) He mixed a thing (S, K) with (بِ) another<br>\
thing. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He picked out, chose out, or<br>\
selected, a thing: the verb thus having two contr.<br>\
significations. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
and inf. n. as above, (S,) He polished a sword,<br>\
(S, K,) by laying on it a broad and smooth spearhead and rubbing it therewith: so accord. to ElAhmar, who relates that an Arab of the desert<br>\
said to him, I said to a sword-polisher, “Hast<br>\
thou finished my sword? ” and he answered, نَعَمْ<br>\
إِلَّا أَنِّى لَمْ أَخْشِبْهُ [Yes, except that I have not<br>\
polished it]. (S.) And [or, as in the TA, “or ”]<br>\
He sharpened it. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He forged a<br>\
sword: (K:) or fashioned it with the file, without polishing it: (TA:) or he made it imperfectly,<br>\
not thoroughly, or not well: (A:) thus, again,<br>\
the verb has two contr. significations: (K:) also<br>\
he thus made an arrow: (A:) or he shaped out a<br>\
bow, (AHn, K,) and an arrow, (TA,) [in a rough<br>\
manner, or] by the first operation, (AHn, K,<br>\
TA,) without perfecting it, or making it smooth,<br>\
or even. (TA.) You say of a sword, before it<br>\
has been filed, مَا أَحْسَنَ مَا خُشِبَ [How well has<br>\
it been forged!]: and in like manner one says of<br>\
an arrow, when it has been filed, before the سَفَن<br>\
[with which it is smoothed] has been applied to<br>\
it. (Skr, on a verse of Sakhr, cited below, voce<br>\
خَشِيبَةٌ.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] خَشَبَ الشِّعْرَ, (ISk, S, A, K,)<br>\
aor. and inf. n. as above, (A,) (tropical:)  He said, spoke,<br>\
or uttered, the poetry (ISk, S, A, K) as it came,<br>\
(ISk, S,) [unpolished, and unstudied,] without<br>\
affecting nicety, or refinement, therein, (ISk, S, A,<br>\
K,) and without study, or labour: (A, K:) Jereer<br>\
did thus, and Farezdak trimmed his verses; but<br>\
the verses of Jereer thus produced are better than<br>\
the trimmed verses of Farezdak: (A, TA:) and<br>\
↓ اختشبهُ signifies the same. (A, K.) You say<br>\
also, هُمْ يَخْشِبُونَ الكَلَامَ وَالعَمَلَ (tropical:)  [They say,<br>\
speak, or utter, words, and do work, without<br>\
affecting nicety, or refinement, and without study,<br>\
or labour]: (A:) or imperfectly, or not thoroughly; inelegantly, or not well. (TA.) And<br>\
اِتَّخَذَ السَّيْفَ خَشَبًا: see 8.<br>\
5<br>\
تخشّب: see 8.<br>\
-A2-  تخشّبتِ الإِبِلُ The camels<br>\
ate thick branches: (K:) or ate dry herbage.<br>\
(S.) And تَتَخَشَّبُ عِيدَانَ الشَّجَرِ They take with<br>\
the mouth, and eat, the branches of the trees.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اختشب السَّيْفِ signifies ↓ اِتَّخَذَهُ خَشْبًا; He<br>\
took the sword without choosing the best by taking<br>\
it from this place or that; (L, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ تحشّبهُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, near the end.<br>\
12<br>\
اخشوشب He [a man or a camel (see<br>\
خَشِبٌ)] was, or became, tall, and gross, rude, or<br>\
coarse, with bones uncovered by flesh, and hard,<br>\
or hardy. (K.) He (an ostrich) was, or became,<br>\
rough, or coarse. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  He (a man) became<br>\
hard, or hardy, and rough, or coarse, in his<br>\
religion, clothing, food, and in all respects. (TA.)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He employed himself in work, and in walking<br>\
barefoot, in order that his body might become<br>\
thick, gross, or coarse. (S, TA.) And اخشوشب<br>\
فِى عَيْشِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He endured with patience a life of<br>\
hardship, or difficulty: or he subjected himself to<br>\
a life of hardship, or difficulty, in order to render<br>\
himself the more able to bear it. (K, TA.)<br>\
اِخْشَوْشِبُوا is thus used in a trad. of &#39;Omar: (S,<br>\
TA:) or, as some relate it, the word is [اجشوشبوا,]<br>\
with ج; or, accord. to some, اخشوشنوا, with خ<br>\
and ن. (TA.)<br>\
رَجُلٌ قِشْبٌ خِشْبٌ A man in whom is no good:<br>\
(S, K:) or with whom is no good: (TA:) [in<br>\
some copies of the K, خِشْبٌ وَ قِشْبٌ; but this, as<br>\
is said in the TA, is incorrect:] خِشْبٌ being an<br>\
imitative sequent to قِشْبٌ. (S, TA.)<br>\
خَشَبٌ [Wood, such as is used in carpentry and<br>\
the like; timber;] thick wood: (A, K:) [a coll.<br>\
gen. n.:] n. un. خَشَبَةٌ [signifying a piece of wood<br>\
or timber]: (Msb:) the pl. of the latter, (S,<br>\
Msb, *) or of the former, (K,) is خَشَبٌ, (S, K,<br>\
[i. e., accord. to the K, the pl. is the same as the<br>\
sing., but properly speaking, as said above, this<br>\
is a coll. gen. n.,]) and خُشُبٌ and خُشْبٌ (S,<br>\
Msb, K) and خُشْبَانٌ, (S, K,) [which last is agreeable with analogy as pl. of خَشَبٌ,] or خُشْبَانٌ is pl.<br>\
of خُشْبٌ, and خُشْبٌ is pl. of خَشَبَةٌ. (JK.) The<br>\
hypocrites are described in a trad. as خُشُبٌ بِاللَّيْلِ<br>\
صُخُبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ Like timbers, or pieces of wood, in<br>\
the night; [clamorous in the day;] meaning that<br>\
they pass the night in sleep, without prayer.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَالٌ خَشَبٌ (assumed tropical:)  Cattle that are lean, or<br>\
emaciated, syn. هَزْلَى, (K,) in consequence of their<br>\
feeding upon dry herbage. (TA.) [And it seems<br>\
that ↓ خَشَبٌ signifies the same: for I find in the<br>\
TA, and in a copy of the A which I believe to<br>\
have been used by the author of the TA, mentioned as tropical, مَالٌ خَشَبٌ وَحَطِبٌ جَزْلٌ, app.<br>\
meaning that مَالٌ خَشِبٌ and حَطِبٌ signify جَزْلٌ;<br>\
but جَزْلٌ, I think, is here evidently a mistranscription for هَزْلَى; as حَطِبٌ is explained in the<br>\
S and K as signifying “ very lean or meagre. ”]<br>\
خَشِبٌ Rough, or coarse; as also ↓ أَخْشَبُخَشِيبٌ:<br>\
(K:) the former applied in this sense to a male<br>\
ostrich: (S:) and both signify anything gross,<br>\
or big, and rough, or coarse; (A &#39;Obeyd, S;) as<br>\
also ↓ خَشِيبٌ: (TA:) and the first, (K,) applied<br>\
to a man and to a camel, (TA,) tall, and gross,<br>\
rude, or coarse, with bones uncovered by flesh,<br>\
and hard, or hardy, and strong; (K, * TA;) as<br>\
also ↓ خَشِيبٌ and ↓ خَشِيبِىٌّ: (K:) or these three<br>\
signify, or signify also, dry, or rigid, or tough:<br>\
(Kr, ISd:) and خَشِبٌ, a man hard, or hardy,<br>\
strong, and vigorous, in body: (A, TA:) and the<br>\
same, (JK,) or ↓ خَشِيبٌ, (TA,) a man whose<br>\
bones are uncovered by flesh, and whose sinews<br>\
are apparent; (JK, TA;) hard, or hardy, and<br>\
strong: (JK:) and the last, a gross, big, or<br>\
coarse, camel: (S, TA:) a camel gross, coarse,<br>\
or rude, in make, and ugly: (TA:) and a horse<br>\
thick, or big, in the bones. (Ham p. 207.) See<br>\
also خَشَبٌ. And see أَخْشَبُ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also (assumed tropical:)  Life in which one is not dainty, nice, or<br>\
scrupulous. (K.)<br>\
خَشْبَةٌ The first filing of a sword, before the<br>\
polishing. (TA.)<br>\
خُشْبَانٌ: see أَخْشَبُ.<br>\
خَشَابٌ: see أَخْشَبُ.<br>\
خُشَابٌ, from the Persian خُوشْ آبْ, [The beverage properly called in Arabic] نَبِيذ. (TA.)<br>\
خَشِيبٌ and ↓ مَخْشُوبٌ Mixed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
the former, (K,) or both, (TA,) Picked out,<br>\
chosen, or selected: (K, TA:) both words thus<br>\
having two contr. significations. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
the former (S, K) and latter, (K,) A sword<br>\
polished: (S, K: *) this is [said to be] the prevailing signification: (TA:) or both signify a<br>\
sharpened sword. (JK, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And the former,<br>\
(As, S, K,) or both, (JK, A,) A sword of which<br>\
the forging is commenced; thus [again] having<br>\
two contr. significations: (S:) or forged, (K, *<br>\
TA,) or fashioned with the file, but not yet<br>\
polished: (As, TA:) or newly made: (TA:) or<br>\
imperfectly, not thoroughly, or not well, wrought;<br>\
(JK, A;) and thus both words applied to an arrow:<br>\
(A:) or the former, (S, K,) or both, (TA,) applied<br>\
to an arrow, (S, K,) and to a bow, (K,) shaped out<br>\
(S, K) [in a rough manner,] by the first operation, (S, TA,) not yet perfected, or made smooth,<br>\
or even: (TA:) pl. of the former (accord. to the<br>\
TA as applied to a bow [but I see no reason for<br>\
this restriction]) خُشُبٌ and خَشَائِبُ. (K.)<br>\
لَمْ يُنَقَّحْ ↓ مَخْشُوبٌ [Rough hewn, not yet<br>\
trimmed,] is a prov., mentioned by Meyd and Z.<br>\
(MF, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] شِعْرٌ خَشِيبٌ and ↓ مَخْشُوبٌ<br>\
(tropical:)  Poetry said, spoken, or uttered, as it has come to<br>\
the speaker, [unpolished, and unstudied,] without<br>\
his affecting nicety, or refinement, therein, and<br>\
without study, or labour. (A, * TA.) And جَآءَ<br>\
↓ بِلمَخْشُوبِ (tropical:)  [He said, or uttered, that which<br>\
came to him, as it came, unpolished, and unstudied]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also خَشِيبٌ voce خَشِبٌ,<br>\
in three places. ―<br>\
-b5-  It also signifies Bad, corrupt,<br>\
or vile. (K.)<br>\
خَشِيبَةٌ The natural quality [of the metal] of a<br>\
sword, (Skr on the verse here following, S, TA,)<br>\
before the making thereof is completed: (Skr:)<br>\
or its blade, or iron: (A:) or its edge: or its<br>\
polish. (JK.) Sakhr says,<br>\
وَصَارِمٌ أُخْلِصَتْ خَشِيبَتُهُ<br>\
أَبْيَضُ مَهْوٌ فِى مَتْنِهِ زُبَدُ<br>\
And a sharp sword of which the natural quality<br>\
[of the metal] before the completion of the making<br>\
thereof has been refined, [white, or a sword,] thin<br>\
in the two edges or sides, having [in its broad<br>\
side] diversified marks. (Skr.)<br>\
خَشِيبِىٌّ: see خَشِبٌ.<br>\
خَشَّابٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
خَشَّابَةٌ [a coll. gen. n., of which the n. un. is<br>\
↓ خَشَّابٌ,] Sellers of خَشَب [i. e. wood, or timber].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Fighters with staves.<br>\
-A2-  Accord. to ElHejeree, خشابة [so in the TA, without any syll.<br>\
sign,] signifies A slender [implement of the kind<br>\
called] مطرق [i. e. مِطْرَق, q. v.,] which the polisher,<br>\
when he has finished the polishing of a sword,<br>\
passes over it, in consequence of which the scabbard<br>\
does not alter its state. (TA.)<br>\
خَاشِبٌ: see مُخْتَشِبٌ.<br>\
أَخْشَبُ: see خَشِبٌ. Also A great mountain:<br>\
(A:) or a rugged, or rough, and great mountain; (S, K;) and so ↓ جَبَلٌ خَشِبٌ: or such as<br>\
is not to be ascended: (TA:) an elevated place,<br>\
rugged, with rough stones: (JK:) a tract of the<br>\
kind termed قُفّ, rugged and stony: (TA:) pl.<br>\
أَخَاشِبُ, (A, TA,) because the quality of a subst.<br>\
is predominant in it: and the fem. خَشْبَآءُ is also<br>\
sometimes used in the same sense; or as syn.<br>\
with غَيْضَةٌ [i. e. a thicket, &amp;c.]; but the former<br>\
meaning is better known: and this [likewise] is<br>\
thought to be rather a subst. than an epithet,<br>\
because of the pl., mentioned above: (TA:) and<br>\
↓ خُشْبَانٌ [also seems to be a pl. of أَخْشَبُ, or of<br>\
خَشِبٌ; for it is said that it] signifies rugged, or<br>\
rough, mountains, neither great nor small: (K:)<br>\
and rugged ground. (TA in art. ذنب.) خَشْبَآءُ<br>\
also signifies Hard land or ground; (K, * TA;)<br>\

and earth or clay. (IAmb, TA.) And أَرْضٌ<br>\
↓ خَشَابٌ (K, TA) Hard land or ground, like<br>\
خَشْبَآءُ, (TA,) that flows with the least rain. (K,<br>\
TA.) And أَكَمَةٌ خَشْبَآءُ (S, TA) A hill of which<br>\
the stones are scattered, but near together. (TA.)<br>\
And جَبْهَةٌ خَشْبَآءُ A displeasing forehead; as also<br>\

الجَبْهَةِ A man having a displeasing and rigid<br>\
forehead. (TA.)<br>\
بَيْتٌ مُخَشَّبٌ [so in the present day, but written<br>\
in the TA without any syll. sign,] A house having<br>\
خَشَب [i. e. wood, or timber, employed in its construction]. (TA.)<br>\
مَخْشُوبٌ: see خَشِيبٌ, in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is<br>\
applied to a horse, by El-Aashà; (S, TA;) meaning Of mixed pedigree: (A &#39;Obeyd, TA:) or not<br>\
broken; not well trained; from what next follows; and thus used only by El-Aashà. (IKh,<br>\

-b4-  طَعَامٌ مَخْشُوبٌ<br>\

not thoroughly cooked; and if not flesh-meat,<br>\
(but grain, TA,) without any seasoning, or condiment, to render it pleasant, or savoury. (K, *<br>\
TA.)<br>\
مُخْتَشِبٌ One who eats what he can; as also<br>\
↓ خَاشِبٌ. (JK.)<br>\
