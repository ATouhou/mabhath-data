خَبْأَةٌ A daughter; syn. بِنْتٌ. (K, TA. [In the<br>\

خَبْأَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ يَفَعَةِ سَوْءٍ [A daughter is better than<br>\
a grown-up boy of evil deeds]. (TA.) [In Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov., i. 438, the first word in this<br>\
prov. is written خُبَأَة, and followed by صِدْقٍ.]<br>\
Aboo-Zeyd Sa&#39;eed Ibn-Ows El-Ansáree entitled<br>\
one of his books كتاب خبأة because he commenced it by mentioning خبأة in the sense of<br>\
بنت, quoting the foregoing prov. in confirmation<br>\

(Msb:) or a tent having one pole; that which<br>\
has more than one pole being termed بيت: (AZ,<br>\

tent] of any kind: (Towsheeh, TA voce بَيْتٌ,<br>\
q. v.:) pl. أَخْبِئَةٌ, (TA,) or أَخْبِيَةٌ: (Msb:) it is<br>\
from خَبَأَهُ “ he hid it,” or “ concealed it: ” (Mgh:)<br>\
or it belongs to art. خبى: (K:) most of the lexicologists hold that its radical letters are خبى:<br>\
some, that they are خبو: IDrd asserts that they<br>\
are خبأ. (TA:) [See also art. خبى.]<br>\
-A2-  A mark<br>\
made with a hot iron upon some secret part of an<br>\
excellent she-camel: pl. أَخْبِئَةٌ. (Lth, K.)<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  Wine. (Har p. 365.)<br>\
مَخْبَأٌ A place, or chamber, for hiding or concealing [anything]; a secret place or chamber:<br>\
pl. مَخَابِئُ. (MA.)<br>\
جَارِيَةٌ مُخَبَّأَةٌ; so in the [S and] O, and in some<br>\
of the correct copies of the K; in other copies of<br>\
the K مُخْبَأَةٌ; (TA;) [and thus in the CK;] A<br>\
