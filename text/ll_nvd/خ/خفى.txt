خَفِىَ, (Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. يَخْفَى, (Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. خَفَآءٌ, (Mgh, Msb, K,) has two contr.<br>\
significations: (Mgh, Msb:) It was, or became,<br>\
unperceived or imperceptible, [or hardly perceived or perceptible, by any of the senses, or only<br>\
by the eye or ear, or by the mind; mostly] unapparent, or not apparent; (K;) [latent; obscure;] hidden, concealed, or covered; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) [or unconspicuous; but also faint, or<br>\
dim, to the sight; suppressed, or stifled, said of<br>\
the voice; or low, faint, gentle, or soft, to the<br>\
ear; and obscure to the mind, abstruse, recondite,<br>\
occult, or covert; and secret, private, or clandestine:] and the contr., i. e. it appeared; it was,<br>\
or became, apparent, open, manifest, plain, or<br>\
evident; (Mgh, Msb;) [as also ↓ استخفى: (see<br>\
مُسْتَخْفٍ, below:)] or, accord. to some, the particle<br>\
that connects it with its subject distinguishes one<br>\
meaning from the other: (Msb:) you say, خَفِى<br>\
عَلَيْهِ, aor. and inf. n. as above, (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
TA,) it (a thing, or an affair, Mgh) was, or became, unperceived or imperceptible, [&amp;c., by<br>\
him;] unapparent, or not apparent, [or obscure,<br>\
&amp;c., to him;] (TA;) or hidden, or concealed, from<br>\
him: (Mgh, Msb:) and خَفِىَ لَهُ it appeared to<br>\
him; it was, or became, perceptible, apparent,<br>\
open, &amp;c., to him: [but see what follows:] (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) whence the sayings of Mohammad, [app.<br>\
the Hanafee Imám,] referring to spoils, فَخَفِى<br>\
لَهُمْ أَنْ يَذْهَبُوا بِهَا وَيَكْتُمُوهَا أَهْلَ الشِّرْكِ, i. e. It appeared [to them that they should go away with<br>\
them, or take them away, and conceal them from<br>\
the believers in a plurality of gods], and خَفِىَ<br>\
لَهُمْ أَنْ يُخْرِجُوهَا إِلَى دَارِ الإِسْلَامِ [It appeared<br>\
to them that they should take them forth to the<br>\
territory of El-Islám]: but this is said only in<br>\
relation to that which appears from a state of concealment or from a hidden quarter. (Mgh.)<br>\
[Hence,] بَرِحَ الخَفَآءُ The affair, or case, became<br>\
manifest: (S, K:) or the state of concealment departed, or ceased; but the former explanation is better: or, as some say, ↓ الخَفَآءُ here signifies the secret;<br>\
and the meaning is, the secret became apparent:<br>\
(TA:) or, lit., the low ground became high and<br>\
apparent; meaning (assumed tropical:)  what was concealed became<br>\
revealed. (Har pp. 133-4. [See also art. برح.])<br>\
[And عَلَى خَفَآءٍ means Covertly, secretly, privately, stealthily, or clandestinely. (See also what<br>\
follows.)] ―<br>\
-b2-  خَفِيتُ لَهُ, aor.<br>\
خَفَىَ, (K,) inf. n. خُفْيَةٌ<br>\
and خِفْيَةٌ (Msb, K) and خِفْوَةٌ, (K,) the ى and<br>\
و being interchangeable, (TA,) signifies ↓ اِخْتَفَيْتُ<br>\
[i. e. I made myself unapparent to him, lurked,<br>\
or lay hid or in ambush, for him; cloaked, or<br>\
disguised, myself to him; hid, or concealed, myself from him]: (K:) [for] اختفى signifies he<br>\
hid, or concealed, himself, (Fr, * El-Fárábee,<br>\
JK, * Msb, K,) مِنْهُ from him; (TA;) as also<br>\
↓ استخفى, (Fr, * JK, * Msb, K,) and ↓ اخفى,<br>\
(IAar, K,) and ↓ تخفّى also is syn. with اختفى<br>\
[in this sense]: (Z, TA:) or you say, ↓ اِسْتَخْفَيْتُ<br>\
مِنْكَ, meaning I hid, or concealed, myself from<br>\
thee; but not ↓ اِخْتَفَيْتُ: (IKt, Th, S, Msb:) or<br>\
↓ اختفى in the sense of خَفِىَ is not of high<br>\
authority, nor is it disallowed, (Az, Msb, TA,)<br>\
but ↓ استخفى is more usual. (Az, TA.) You<br>\
say, فَعَلْتُهُ خُفْيَةً and خِفْيَةً [I did it covertly, secretly, privately, stealthily, or clandestinely].<br>\
(Msb) And قُتِلَ خفْيَةً and خِفْوَةً [He was slain<br>\
covertly, secretly, &amp;c.]. (JK.) And يَأْكُلُهُ خِفْوَةً<br>\
[lit. He eats it covertly, &amp;c.,] means he steals it.<br>\
(K.) In the saying in the Kur [vii. 53], اُدْعُو<br>\
رَبَّكُمْ تَضَرُّعًا وَخُفْيَةً, the meaning [of the last word]<br>\
is, Submissively, devoting yourselves to his service:<br>\
or, accord. to Zj, adhering to his service in your<br>\
minds: or, accord. to Th, celebrating Him in your<br>\
minds: or, accord. to Lh, in quietness, and stillness: (TA:) or secretly; and so in the similar<br>\
passage in the Kur vi. 63. (Jel, and so Bd on<br>\
this latter passage.) خُفْيَةٌ is from أَخْفَيْتُ الصَّوْتَ<br>\
[explained below in this paragraph]: (JK:) the<br>\
intrans. v. whereof is ↓ اختفى [signifying It (the<br>\
voice) was, or became, suppressed, or stifled; or<br>\
low, faint, gentle, or soft; like خَفِىَ, which is<br>\
more common]. (Lth, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  خَفَاهُ, aor. يَخْفِيهِ,<br>\
(JK, S, Msb, K,) inf. n. خَفْىٌ (JK, Msb, * K)<br>\
and خُفِىٌّ, (K,) also has two contr. significations:<br>\
(S, Msb, TA:) He made it perceptible, apparent,<br>\
open, manifest, plain, or evident: (JK, S, Msb,<br>\
K:) and he hid, or concealed, or covered, it; (S,<br>\
Msb, K; [in this latter sense, erroneously written<br>\
in the CK خَفّاهُ;]) as also ↓ اخفاهُ: (S, K:) or,<br>\
accord. to some, this latter has the latter meaning;<br>\
and the former verb has [only] the former meaning: but accord. to other, the reverse is the case:<br>\
(Msb:) or, accord. to Aboo-&#39; Alee El-Kálee, the<br>\
former verb has the former meaning only; and<br>\
↓ the latter verb has both meanings: (IB, TA:)<br>\
↓ the latter is also explained as signifying he removed its خِفَآء, i. e. its covering: (TA:) and the<br>\
former, as meaning he made it to come forth from<br>\
a state of concealment: (JK:) and he drew it<br>\
forth; (K;) as also ↓ اختفاهُ. (S, Msb, K.) One<br>\
says, خَفَى المَطَرُ الفَأْرَ The rain made the rats, or<br>\
mice, to come forth from their holes. (S.) It is<br>\
said in the Kur [xx. 15], إِنَّ السَّاعَةَ آتِيَةٌ أَكَادُ<br>\
أَخْفِيهَا, (JK, TA,) or ↓ أُخْفِيهَا, (JK, S, TA,)<br>\
accord. to different readers: (TA:) the former<br>\
means [Verily the hour of the resurrection is<br>\
coming:] I am almost making it to appear:<br>\
(JK, TA:) and the latter, I am almost removing<br>\
that which conceals it: (S, IJ, TA:) or I almost<br>\
conceal it: (JK, TA:) or, as Ubeí reads it,<br>\
أَكَادُ أُخْفِيهَا مِنْ نَفِْسى [I almost conceal it from<br>\
Myself]: and Fr says [that the meaning is], I<br>\
almost conceal it from Myself, and how then<br>\
should I acquaint you therewith? (TA.) And<br>\
it is said in a trad. respecting the flight [from<br>\
Mekkeh], اخفى عَنَّا خَبَرَكَ [written without the<br>\
vowel-signs, so that it may be اِخْفِى or ↓ أَخْفِى,]<br>\
i. e. Conceal thou thine information from such as<br>\
may ask thee respecting us. (TA.) And in<br>\
another trad., كَانَ يَخْفِى صَوْتَهُ بِأَنِينٍ, thus with<br>\
fet-h to the ى, meaning He used to make his<br>\
voice perceptible [or audible, with moaning].<br>\
(TA.) And you say, الصَّوْتَ ↓ أَخْفَيْتُ [meaning<br>\
I suppressed, or stifled, the voice; or made it low,<br>\
faint, gentle, or soft]. (Lth, JK, TA.) [And<br>\
الكَلَامَ ↓ اخفى He uttered speech, or the speech,<br>\
in a low, faint, gentle, or soft, tone; he spoke in<br>\
a low, faint, gentle, or soft, manner; lit. he made<br>\
speech, or the speech, to be low, &amp;c.]<br>\

dim star or asterism. And مَكَانٌ خَفِىٌّ An obscure, or a concealed, place. And صَوْتٌ خَفِىٌّ A<br>\

this indicates her being bashful, or shy; and<br>\
when her foot-marks are near together, and firmly<br>\
impressed, they indicate that she has [large] buttocks and haunches. (Yaakoob, S.) One says<br>\

↓ اخَافِيَةُ: (K:) or this last signifies what conceals<br>\
