خَلَفَ, aor.<br>\
خَلُفَ, inf. n. خَلْفٌ, He came after,<br>\
followed, succeeded, or remained after, another,<br>\
or another that had perished or died. (TA.)<br>\
Hence, in the Kur [vii. 168 and xix. 60], فَخَلَفَ<br>\
مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ (TA) And there hath succeeded<br>\
them, or come after them, [a posterity, or] an<br>\
evil posterity. (Bd in xix. 60.) And خَلَفَهُ He<br>\
came after him, (S, A in art. دبر, Mgh, Msb, TA,)<br>\
or behind him, (A ubi suprà, Mgh,) or following<br>\
him nearly; (A ubi suprà;) inf. n. as above,<br>\
(Mgh, TA,) and خِلْفَةٌ also: (Mgh:) or he remained after him: (K:) and ↓ جَآءَ خِلَافَهُ likewise signifies [the same as جآء خَلْفَهُ; an inf. n.<br>\
of خَالَفَ being thus used as an adv. n.; i. e.] he<br>\
came after him. (TA.) You say also, خَلَفَ اللَّيْلُ<br>\
النَّهَارَ, inf. n. خَلْفٌ and خِلْفَةٌ, The night followed,<br>\
or came after, the day. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
خَلَفْتُهُ, [aor. as above,] inf. n. خَلْفٌ, [perhaps a<br>\
mistranscription for خَلَفَ,] I was, after him, a<br>\
substitute for him: (TA:) [I supplied his place:<br>\
and I superseded him.] And خَلَفَهُ, (aor. as<br>\
above, TA,) inf. n. خِلَافَةٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA)<br>\
and خَلَفٌ (TA) and خِلِّيقَى, (S, * K, * TA,) which<br>\
last is an inf. n. of the intensive kind, (Sgh,<br>\
MF, TA,) He was, or became, his خَلِيفَة [i. e.<br>\
successor, or vice-agent, &amp;c.], (S, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
or his substitute; (TA;) فِى قَوْمِهِ [among, or in<br>\
respect of, his people], (S, TA,) and أَهْلِهِ [his<br>\
family]; relating to good and to evil; wherefore<br>\
one says, أَوْصَى لَهُ بِالخِلَافَةِ [he charged him by<br>\
his will with the being his successor, or vice-agent,<br>\
&amp;c.]; (TA;) or عَلَى أَهْلِهِ وَمَالِهِ [over his family<br>\
and his property]: (Msb:) and ↓ اختفلهُ signifies<br>\
the same; (Lh, Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K;) he was, or<br>\
became, his خَلِيفَة (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA) after<br>\
him. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA.) And خَلَفَ فُلَانًا [alone]<br>\
He was, or became, the خَلِيفَةٌ of such a one<br>\
among, or in respect of, his family (K, TA) and<br>\
his children. (TA.) And خَلَفَهُ رَبُّهُ فِى أَهْلِهِ (K,<br>\
TA) and وَلَدِهِ, (TA,) inf. n. خِلَافَةٌ, (K,) His<br>\
Lord was [for him] a خَلِيفَة [or supplier of his<br>\
place] to his family (K, TA) and his children.<br>\
(TA. [In the CK, اخلف is made to signify the<br>\
same; but this is in consequence of an omission.])<br>\
And one says, خَلَفَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ May God be to<br>\
to thee a خَلِيفَة [or supplier of the place] (S, Msb,<br>\
K) of thy father; (S, Msb,) or of the one whom thou<br>\
hast lost: (S, Msb, K:) thus one says to one who<br>\
has lost by death his father (S, Msb, K) or mother<br>\
(K) or paternal uncle (S, Msb) or any other who<br>\
cannot be replaced: (Msb, K:) and خَلَفَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
عَلَيْكَ خَيْرًا, (K,) or بِخَيْرٍ, (AZ, Msb, K,) or both,<br>\
(L,) and خَلَفَ اللّٰهُ لَكَ بِخَيْرٍ, (AZ, Msb,) and<br>\
اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ خَيْرًا ↓ أَخْلَفَ and لَكَ خَيْرًا: (K: [in<br>\
which it is implied that these phrases mean May<br>\
God supply to thee well the place of him whom<br>\
thou hast lost: but it is implied in the Msb that<br>\
the two of them there mentioned mean May God<br>\
restore to thee good in the place of that which has<br>\
gone from thee: and it appears from what here<br>\
follows that all of these phrases have the latter<br>\
meaning, whether or not they have the former<br>\
meaning also:]) to him who has lost property or<br>\
a child or a thing [of any other kind] of which<br>\
the replacement may be asked, (S,) or to him<br>\
of whom that which may be replaced has perished,<br>\
or died, (K,) one says, اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ ↓ أَخْلَفَ (S, Msb,<br>\
K) May God restore to thee the like of that which<br>\
has gone from thee, (S, Msb,) or may God restore to thee what has gone from thee; (K in a<br>\
later part of the art.;) and اللّٰه لَكَ ↓ اخلف; and<br>\
خَلَفَ اللّٰه لك : or خَلَفَ اللّٰه عَلَيْكَ is allowable in<br>\
relation to property and the like; and يَخْلَفُ,<br>\
like يَمْنَعُ is allowable as its aor., though extr.,<br>\
(K,) as it has no faucial letter to occasion the<br>\
fet-h: (TA:) and one says also, خَلَفَ اللّٰهُ لَكَ<br>\
بِخَيْرٍ meaning May God give thee good in the<br>\
place of that which has gone from thee; (TA;)<br>\
and عَلَيْكَ خَيْرًا ↓ اخلف, (Msb, TA,) meaning the<br>\
same; (TA;) and [so] لَكَ خَيْرًا ↓ اخلف and بِخَيْرٍ:<br>\
and اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ مَالَكَ ↓ اخلف and لَكَ مَالَكَ [May<br>\
God restore, or replace, to thee thy property].<br>\
(Msb.) خَلَفَ أَبَاهُ, (K,) aor.<br>\
خَلُفَ (TA,) means He<br>\
became behind his father; (K;) and if so, its<br>\
inf. n. is خَلْفٌ: (TA:) or it means he became in<br>\
the place of his father; (K;) and if so, its inf. n.<br>\
is خَلَفٌ: (TA:) and خَلَفَ مَكَانَ أَبِيهِ, inf. n.<br>\
خِلَافَةٌ (K) and خَلَفٌ, (TA,) he became in the<br>\
place of his father, exclusively of every other.<br>\
(K.) You say also, خَلَفَتِ الفَاكِهَةِ بَعْضُهَا بَعْضًا,<br>\
(JK, K,) inf. n. خَلْفٌ, (JK, TA,) or خَلَفٌ, (TA,<br>\
[the former being there altered to the latter (which<br>\
is the more probably correct), or the latter to the<br>\
former,]) and خِلْفَةٌ, (JK, TA,) The fruit replaced other fruit; or became substituted for other<br>\
fruit. (JK, * K,* TA. [In the CK, صَارَ خَلْفًا is<br>\
erroneously put for صَارَتْ خَلَفًا.]) And خَلَفَ فُلَانٌ<br>\
عَلَى فُلَانَةَ, inf. n. خِلَافَةٌ, [like عَقَبَ عَلَيْهَا,] Such<br>\
a man took as his wife such a woman after another<br>\
husband [and thus supplied his place]. (Z, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  خَلَفَ ُلَانًا, (aor.<br>\
خَلُفَ, TA,) He took, or seized,<br>\
such a one from behind him; (JK, * K;) as also<br>\
↓ اختلفهُ. (TA.) And hence, (TA,) خَلَفَ لَهُ<br>\
بِالسَّيْفِ (JK, TA) He came to him from behind<br>\
him, and smote his neck, or struck off his head,<br>\
with the sword. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  خَلَفَ فُلَانٌ بِعَقِبِى [is<br>\
explained as meaning] Such a one stayed, or abode,<br>\
after me. (Msb in art. عقب) [But] ―<br>\
-b5-  خَلَفَ<br>\
بِعَقَبِ فُلَانٍ is said by some to mean إِلَى ↓ خَالَفَهُ<br>\
أَهْلِهِ [q. v.]: accord. to As, however, it means<br>\
He parted with such a one on the condition of<br>\
doing a certain thing, and then came behind him<br>\
[or behind his back] and did another thing after<br>\
parting with him: and Az says that this is a more<br>\
correct explanation than the former one. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence, app.,] one says also, إِنَّ امْرَأَةَ فُلَانٍ<br>\
تَخْلُفُ زَوْجَهَا بِالنِّزَاعِ إِلَى غَيْرِهِ إِذَا غَابَ عَنْهَا [Verily<br>\
the wife of such a one is unfaithful to her husband by yearning towards another when he is<br>\
absent from her: or deceives her husband behind<br>\
his back by yearning towards another; for it is<br>\
implied, by an ex. given, that اذا غاب عنها is added<br>\
by way of explanation]. (TA.) خَلَفَهُ also signifies He spoke of him, or mentioned him, [behind his back, or] when he was not present: so in<br>\
the phrase, خَلَفَهُ بِخَيْرٍ or بِشَرٍّ [He spoke of him<br>\
behind his back well or ill]. (TA.) And one says,<br>\
يَخْلُفُ النَّاسَ مِنْ وَرَائِهِمْ [meaning He defames<br>\
men behind their backs]: the action signified<br>\
hereby is like غِيبَةٌ, and may be [by making<br>\
signs] with the side of the mouth, and with the<br>\
eye, and with the head. (TA in art. همز.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
خَلَفَ عَنْ أَصْحَابِهِ, (K, TA,) aor.<br>\
خَلُفَ, He remained<br>\
behind, or after, his companions; did not go forth<br>\
with them; as also أَصْحَابِهِ ↓ قَعَدَ خِلَافَ [similar<br>\
to a phrase mentioned near the beginning of this<br>\
art.]; (TA;) i. q. ↓ تخلّف; (K in explanation<br>\
of the former phrase;) which is syn. with تَأَخَّرَ;<br>\
(S, K;) as in the phrase تخلّف عَنِّى [which means<br>\
He remained behind me, or after me]; (S;)<br>\
[for] تخلّف عَنْهُ means بَقِىَ خَلْفَهُ; (Mgh;) and<br>\
[in like manner] you say, تخلّف عَنِ لاقَوْمِ He<br>\
remained behind, or after, the people, or party,<br>\
not going with them; [he held back, or hung back,<br>\
from them;] and ↓ قَعَدْتُ خِلَافَهُ [i. e. I remained]<br>\
behind him, or after him; (Msb;) and ↓ خالف<br>\
عَنَّا He remained behind us, or after us; syn.<br>\
↓ تخلّف. (TA, from a trad.) It is said in the<br>\
Kur [xvii. 78], إِلَّا قَلِيلًا ↓ وَ إِذَا لَا يَلْبَثُونَ خِلَافَكَ,<br>\
i. e. [But in that case they should not have remained] after thee [save a little while]: (JK,<br>\
TA: *) so accord. to one reading [instead of خَلْفَكَ,<br>\
which means the same]. (TA.) And in like<br>\
manner, رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ ↓ فَرِحَ المُخَلَّفُونَ بِمَقْعَدِهِمْ خِلَافَ,<br>\
in the Kur [ix. 82], means [Those who were left<br>\
behind rejoiced in their remaining] behind the<br>\
Apostle of God: (S, TA:) or the meaning here<br>\
is, مُخَالَفَةَ رسول اللّٰه [i. e. in disagreement with<br>\
the Apostle of God]: (JK, S:) thus says Lh;<br>\
but IB disagrees with him; saying that خلاف<br>\
here means بَعْدَ; and cites six exs. in which it has<br>\
this meaning, from poets. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [Hence,]<br>\
خَلَفَ فُلَانٌ عَنْ كُلِّ خَيْرٍ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one was, or<br>\
became, kept back from all good; i. e.,] did not<br>\
prosper, or was not successful. (TA. [It is there<br>\
added, that it is explained in the A as tropical,<br>\
and as meaning تَغَيَّرَ وَفَسَدَ: but this is perhaps a<br>\
mistake, occasioned by the accidental omission of<br>\
وَخَلَفَ اللَّبَنُ or the like, of which this is a correct<br>\
explanation: or the phrase thus explained in the<br>\
TA, as from the A, may correctly mean He became altered for the worse, and corrupt; agreeably<br>\
with other explanations of the verb below.]) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
خَلَفَ, aor.<br>\
خَلُفَ, also signifies He (a man) retired,<br>\
withdrew, or went away or apart. (JK.) And<br>\
خَلَفَتْ نَفْسَهُ عَنِ الطَّعَامِ, aor.<br>\
خَلُفَ, inf. n. خُلُوفٌ,<br>\
(assumed tropical:) His soul turned away from, avoided, or shunned,<br>\
the food, in consequence of disease. (JK, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b9-  And He fled. (Ham p. 411.) ―<br>\
-b10-  And He<br>\
(a man, Sgh) ascended a mountain. (Sgh, K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 2, first sentence.<br>\
-A3-  خَلَفَ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K, &amp;c.,) aor. خُلُوفٌ, (Lh, Msb, TA, and Ham p. 679,)<br>\
[inf. n. خُلُوفٌ,] said of the taste of water, It was,<br>\
or became, different from, or contrary to, what<br>\
it was thought to be: and [hence,] it was, or became, altered [for the worse]: (Ham ubi suprà:)<br>\
[and] said of milk, (S, K,) and of food, (Lh, S,<br>\
Msb, K,) and the like, (Lh, TA,) and some say<br>\
خَلُفَ, (TA,) aor.<br>\
خَلُفَ, inf. n. خُلُوفٌ, (Lh, TA,) of<br>\
both verbs, (TA,) it was, or became, altered [for<br>\
the worse] (Lh, S, Msb, K) in taste, or in odour;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ اخلف: or, said of milk,<br>\
the first signifies it became bad from being long<br>\
kept; or, as in the A, (tropical:)  what was good thereof<br>\
became mixed (خُلِفَ, i. e. خُلِطَ,) with other milk:<br>\
and ↓ اخلف, said of milk, signifies also it was, or<br>\
became, sour: (TA:) and the first, said of [the<br>\
beverage called] نَبِيذ, it became bad. (K.) Also,<br>\
inf. n. خُلُوفٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and خُلُوفَةٌ (K)<br>\
and خِلْفَةٌ, (L, TA,) said of the mouth (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K) of a person fasting, (S, Msb, K,) It was,<br>\
or became, altered [for the worse] in odour; (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) as also ↓ اخلف. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
It is said in a trad. that the خُلُوف of the mouth<br>\
of one who is fasting is sweeter in the estimation<br>\
of God than the odour of musk: or, accord. to<br>\
some of the lawyers and of the relaters of traditions, خَلُوف; but [SM says,] I think this to<br>\
be a mistake, as several affirm it to be, while<br>\
others say that it is of a bad dial. : accord. to one<br>\
reading, it is خِلْفَة. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] خَلَفَ<br>\
عَنْ خُلُقِ أَبِيهِ, (K,) aor.<br>\
خَلُفَ, inf. n. خُلُوفٌ, (TA,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:) He was, or became, altered [for the worse]<br>\
from the natural disposition of his father. (K,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And خَلَفَ, (ISk, S, K,) inf. n. خَلْفٌ<br>\
[or خُلُوفٌ]; or خَلْفَ, aor.<br>\
خَلُفَ, inf. n. خَلَافَةٌ and<br>\
خُلُوفٌ; (TA;) (assumed tropical:)  He (a man) was, or became,<br>\
bad, or corrupt. (ISk, S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And خَلَفَ,<br>\
(K) inf. n. خَلَافَةٌ (IAth, K) and خُلُوفٌ, (K,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:) He (a man) was, or became, stupid, or foolish;<br>\
or one who had little, or no, intellect or understanding: (K, * TA:) or unprofitable: or a frequent promise-breaker: (IAth:) or خَلَفَ and<br>\
↓ اخلف, said of a slave, he was, or became, idiotic,<br>\
deficient in intellect, or bereft of his intellect.<br>\
(JK.)<br>\
-A4-  خَلَفَ, (K,) inf. n. خَلْفٌ; (S, * K, *<br>\
TA;) and ↓ اخلف, and ↓ استخلف; (S, K;) He<br>\
drew water, (S, K, TA,) لِأَهْلِهِ for his family:<br>\
[app. because he who does so leaves his family<br>\
behind him: see 2, first sentence:] (K, TA:)<br>\
[or] ↓ استخلف, said of a man, signifies اِسْتَعْذَبَ<br>\
المَآء [app. as meaning he sought, or drew, or<br>\
brought, sweet water: see art. عذب]: and,<br>\
accord. to IAar, you say, القَوْمَ ↓ أَخْلَفْتُ, meaning properly I carried sweet water to the people,<br>\
or party, when they were in the [season, or herbage, called] رَبِيع and without sweet water, or<br>\
when they were by salt water: إِخْلَافٌ [as meaning<br>\
the carrying, or drawing, of water,] being [properly] only in the ربيع: in other cases, metaphorically applied. (TA.) El-Hoteíäh says,<br>\
↓ لِزُغْبٍ كَأَوْلَادِ القَطَا رَاثَ خَلْفُهَا<br>\
عَلَى عَاجِزَاتِ النَّهْضِ حُمْرٍ حَوَاصِلُهْ<br>\
(assumed tropical:) [To, or for, downy ones, like the young ones of the<br>\
katà, whose procurer of water has been slow in<br>\
coming to those lacking the power of spreading<br>\
their wings for flight, red in their crops]: he<br>\
means ↓ مِخْلِفُهَا [or خَالِفُهَا], and has put in the<br>\
place of this the inf. n.: and by حواصله, accord.<br>\
to Ks, he means حَوَاصِلُ مَا ذَكْرْنَا [the crops of<br>\
what we have mentioned]: but Fr says that the<br>\
ه relates to the زغب, exclusively of the عاجزات,<br>\
which [latter] has the sign of the pl. ; for every<br>\
pl. that has the form of a sing. may be imagined<br>\
to be a sing., as in the saying of the poet,<br>\
مِثْلُ الفِرَاخِ نُتِفَتْ حَوَاصِلُهْ<br>\
[meaning “ like the young birds of which the<br>\
crops have been plucked ”]; for الفراخ has not<br>\
the sign of the pl., but has the form of a sing.,<br>\
like الكِتَاب and الحِجَاب: another says, [but this<br>\
is very far-fetched,] that the ه relates to النهض,<br>\
which [sometimes] means a place in the shoulderblade of the camel; and that the poet has used it<br>\
metaphorically as belonging to the قطا. (S.)<br>\
-A5-<br>\
خَلَفَ الثَّوْبَ, (S,) or القَمِيصَ, aor.<br>\
خَلُفَ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. خَلْفٌ (Kr, TA) and خُلْفَةٌ, in some copies<br>\
of the K خَلْفَةٌ, [so in my MS. copy of the K,<br>\
and so in the TK,] and [in some] خُلَفٌ also, but<br>\
these require consideration, (TA,) He took out<br>\
from the garment, or shirt, the part that was<br>\
worn out, (S, Msb, K,) that is, the middle part,<br>\
which was worn out, (S, Msb,) and then sewed<br>\
the [cut] edges together. (S, Msb, K.) And<br>\
الثَّوْبَ ↓ اخلف signifies the same as خَلَفَهُ, i. e.<br>\
He repaired the garment [app. in any manner,<br>\
or, as is implied in the S and TA, by substituting<br>\
one piece for another]. (S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The saying, in a trad. of Hamneh, فَإِذَا خَلَفَتْ ذٰلِكَ فَلْتَغْتَسِلْ,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  And when she has discriminated that<br>\
period of days and nights during which she has<br>\
been حَائِض, [she shall perform a complete ablution<br>\
of herself,] is from خَلَفَ القَمِيص signifying as<br>\
explained above. (Msb.)<br>\
-A6-  خَلَفَ signifies also<br>\
He mixed [a thing with another thing; as, for<br>\
instance, (see خُلِفَ in a passage above,) milk<br>\
with other milk]: and he mixed saffron, and<br>\
medicine, with water. (TA.)<br>\
-A7-  خَلَفَ بَيْتَهُ He<br>\
put to, or made for, his tent, a pole, (K, TA,)<br>\
termed a خَالِفَة, (TA,) in the hinder part thereof.<br>\
(K TA.)<br>\
-A8-  خَلِفَ, aor.<br>\
خَلَفَ, (K,) inf. n. خَلَفٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) He (a camel) inclined towards one side.<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  خَلَفٌ is also an inf. n. (of خَلِفَ, said<br>\
of a man, TK) signifying The being أَخْلَف as<br>\
meaning contrarious, hard in disposition, as<br>\
though going with a leaning towards one side:<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  and the being left-handed: ―<br>\
-b4-  and the being<br>\
أَحْوَل [or squint-eyed]. (K.)<br>\
-A9-  خَلِفَتْ, aor.<br>\
خَلَفَ,<br>\
(Msb, K,) inf. n. خَلَفٌ, (Msb, TA,) She (a<br>\
camel) was, or became, pregnant. (Msb, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
خلّفهُ, (Msb,) and خلّفهُ وَرَآءَهُ, (S, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. تَخْلِيفٌ, (TA,) He left him behind him;<br>\
(Msb;) namely, a man: (S, Msb, TA:) and<br>\
↓ خَلَفَهُ [signifies the same: or] he made him to be<br>\
behind him; as also ↓ اخلفهُ [q.v.], and ↓ اختلفهُ:<br>\
(TA:) [whence the saying,] أَلْحَحْتُ عَلَى فُلَانٍ<br>\
↓ فِى الاِتِبَاعِ حَتَّى اخْتَلَفْتُهُ i. e. [I pressed upon<br>\
such a one in following] until I made him to be<br>\
behind me. (ISk, TA.) You say also, خَلَّفَهُمْ,<br>\
inf. n. as above, meaning He was, or became, or<br>\
went, before them; and left them behind him.<br>\
(TA.) And خلّفوا أَثْقالَهُم, inf. n. as above, They<br>\
left their loads, or baggage &amp;c., behind their<br>\
backs; (O, K;) when they went away to draw<br>\
water. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] خلّفهُ He made him,<br>\
or appointed him, his خَلِيفَة [i. e. successor, or<br>\
vice-agent, &amp;c.]; (K;) and so ↓ استخلفهُ. (S,<br>\
Msb, K.) So in the Kur [xxiv. 54], ↓ لَيَسْتَخِلَفَنَّهُمْ<br>\
فِى الْأَرْضِ كَمَا اسْتَخْلَفَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ [That<br>\
He will assuredly make them to be successors in<br>\
the earth, like as He made to be successors those<br>\
who were before them]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  خلّف بِنَاقَتِهِ,<br>\
(S, K,) inf. n. as above, (S,) He bound one of the<br>\
teats of his she-camel with the thing termed صِرَار<br>\
[in order that her young one might not suck it]:<br>\

3<br>\
خالفهُ, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) inf. n. خِلَافٌ (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K, TA) and مُخَالَفَةٌ, (S, Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
He [or it] disagreed with, or differed from, him<br>\
[or it]; or he dissented from him; (Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
contr. of وَافَقَهُ; فِى كَذَا [in, or in respect of,<br>\
such a thing]: (Mgh:) and he, or it, was contrary, opposed, or repugnant, to him, or it:<br>\
(TA:) [and he acted contrarily, contrariously,<br>\
adversely, or in opposition, to him, or it; he, or<br>\
it, contravened, or opposed, him, or it:] and he<br>\
[or it] contradicted him [or it]. (M in art. نقض.)<br>\
It is said in a prov., إِنَّمَا أَنْتَ خِلَافَ الضَّبُعِ الرَّاكِبَ,<br>\
i. e. تُخَالِفُ خِلَافَ الضَّبُعِ [Verily thou art one who<br>\
acts with the contrariousness of the hyena towards<br>\
the rider]: for the hyena [attacks a man on foot,<br>\
but], when it sees the rider, flees from him.<br>\
(IAar, TA.) You say also, خَالَفَنِى عَنْ كَذَا<br>\
He turned away from such a thing [in opposition<br>\
to me, or] when I betook myself to it: [see also<br>\
the last sentence but one of the first paragraph of<br>\
art. بهت:] and خالفنى إِلَى كَذَا He betook himself to such a thing [in opposition to me, or] when<br>\
I turned away from it: (Mgh:) or خالفهُ إِلَى<br>\
الشَّىْءِ means he disobeyed him by betaking himself to the thing; or betook himself to the thing<br>\
after he had forbidden him it. (TA.) And hence,<br>\
(Mgh,) هُوَ يُخَالِفُ إِلَى امْرَأَةِ فُلَانٍ, (S, Mgh, *) or<br>\
إِلَى فُلَانَةَ, (O, L, TA,) in the K erroneously,<br>\
هو يخالف فُلَانَةَ, (TA,) He comes to the wife of<br>\
such a one when he [the latter] is absent from her,<br>\
(S,) or to such a woman when her husband is<br>\
absent from her: (Mgh, * O, L, K, TA:) and<br>\
خالفهُ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ [he came to his (another&#39;s) wife in<br>\
his (the husband&#39;s) absence]: see 1, in the former<br>\
half of the paragraph. (Az, TA.) And خالفهُ<br>\
إِلَيْهِمْ He watched to see him, and, when he was<br>\
absent from them, namely, his family, he went in<br>\
to them: (Jm, O, TA:) and, accord. to AZ,<br>\
فُلَانٌ صَاحِبَهُ ↓ اخلف Such a one watched to see his<br>\
companion, and, when he was absent, he came,<br>\
and went in to him [or rather to his wife or to his<br>\
family]: (TA:) [or] صَاحِبَهُ ↓ خالف he watched<br>\
to see his companion, and, when he was absent,<br>\
went in to his wife: (K, and the like is said in<br>\
the JK:) thus says IDrd, on the authority of<br>\
AZ. (TA.) And خالف إِلَى قَوْمٍ He came to a<br>\
party, or company of men, from behind them [or<br>\
behind their backs]: or he feigned to them the<br>\
contrary of that which he conceived in his mind,<br>\
and took them unawares. (TA.) Aboo-Dhu-eyb<br>\
says, [describing a collector of wild honey,]<br>\
إِذَا لَسَعَتْهُ النَّحْلُ لَمْ يَرْجُ لَسْعَهَا<br>\
وَخَالَفَهَا فِى بَيْتِ نُوبٍ عَوَاسِلِ<br>\
(S in the present art., in which only the former<br>\
hemistich is cited, and in art. رجو,) i. e. [When<br>\
the bees sting him,] he fears not nor minds [their<br>\
stinging], (S in art. رجو) [but comes, during their<br>\
absence, to the hiving-place of bees occupied in<br>\
gathering honey:] meaning, he comes to their<br>\
honey, (S, TA, [in the latter of which, in the<br>\
place of النحل, is put الدَّبْرُ “ the swarm of bees,”])<br>\
and takes it, (TA,) while they are feeding; (S,<br>\
TA;) or, as AA says, he comes behind them to<br>\
the honey while they are absent: AO explains it<br>\
by خَالَفَهَا إِلَى مَوْضِعٍ آخَرَ which [he says] means<br>\
he keeps with them [to another place]; syn.<br>\
لَازَمَهَا; [and thus this phrase (which is strangely<br>\
misinterpreted in the TK and in Freytag&#39;s Lexicon) is explained in the K, but without any<br>\
reference to the verse;] as also حَالَفَهَا, with the<br>\
unpointed ح: (TA:) and some read the verse<br>\
thus; but this reading is said to be a mistake.<br>\
(TA in art. حلف.) ―<br>\
-b2-  جَآءَ خِلَافَهُ: see 1, near the<br>\
beginning of the paragraph. And see also five<br>\
other exs. in the middle portion of the same paragraph. ―<br>\
-b3-  خالف بَيْنَ رِجْلَيْهِ He put one of his<br>\
legs forward and the other backward: and [hence,]<br>\
المُخَالَفَةُ بَيْنَ الرِّجْلَيْنِ [as signifying the alternate<br>\
shifting of the legs to and fro] is metonymically<br>\
used as meaning the act of dancing. (Har p. 108.)<br>\
[And خالف بَيْنَ الشَّيْئَيْنِ He put, or placed, the<br>\
two things contrariwise; or on contrary sides; or<br>\
in contrary directions. Hence,] أَوْ تُقَطَّعَ أَيْدِيهِمْ<br>\
وَأَرْجُلُهُمْ مِنْ خِلَافٍ, in the Kur v. 37, [Or that<br>\
their hands and their feet shall be cut off on contrary sides,] means that their right hands and<br>\
left feet shall be cut off. (Bd, Jel. [See also<br>\
similar exs. in the Kur vii. 121 and xx. 74 and<br>\
xxvi. 49.]) [Hence also,] فَرَسٌ بِهِ شِكَالٌ مِنْ خِلَافٍ,<br>\
(JK,) or ذُو خَدَمَتَانِ مِنْ خِلَافٍ, (TA,) A horse<br>\
having a whiteness in his right fore leg and his<br>\
left hind leg [or the reverse]: (JK, TA:) and<br>\
some say, لَهُ خَدَمَتَانِ مِنْ خِلَافٍ when he has a<br>\
whiteness [or rather a ring of white a little above<br>\
the hoof] in his fore leg [or right fore leg] and<br>\
another in his left fore leg [probably a mistake of<br>\
a copyist for his left hind leg]. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اخلفهُ: see 2, first sentence. Also He put<br>\
him, turned him, or made him to go back or<br>\
stand back, behind him. (K, TA.) And اخلف<br>\
يَدَهُ He put his hand behind him. (Az, TA.) And<br>\
also, (Fr, TA,) or اخلف بِيَدِهِ إِلَى السَّيْفِ, (JK,)<br>\
or simply اخلف [used elliptically], (S, K,) He<br>\
put [back] his hand to his sword, (Fr, S, K, TA,)<br>\
in order to draw it, (JK, S, K, TA,) it being<br>\
hung behind him. (Fr, * TA.) And اخلف السَّيْفَ<br>\
[He hung the sword behind him; or kept it hung<br>\
behind him]: said, in a trad., of a man on the<br>\
day of Bedr. (TA.) And اخلف عَنِ البَعِيرِ [for<br>\
اخلف عَنْهُ الحَقَبَ] He shifted [backwards] the<br>\
hind girth of the camel, putting it next to his<br>\
testicles, on account of its hurting the sheath of<br>\
his penis, and causing a suppression of his urine;<br>\
(As, S, K;) as also اخلف البَعِيرَ: (TA:) or you<br>\
say only, أَخْلِفِ الحَقَبَ, meaning remove thou<br>\
the hind girth from the sheath of the penis. (Lh,<br>\
TA.) And اخلف الدَّابَّةَ بِالسَّوْطِ He struck the<br>\
beast on the hinder part with the whip. (JK.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  اخلف البَازِلَ [He (a camel) exceeded in age<br>\
the بازل, which is generally one that has entered<br>\
his ninth year: as though he made the بازل to be<br>\
behind him: and so, app., اخلف alone; البَازِلَ<br>\
being understood: see مُخْلِفٌ]. El-Jaadee says,<br>\
أَخْلَفَ البَازِلَ عَامًا أَوْ بَزَلْ  أَيِّدِ الكَاهِلِ جَلْدٍ بَازِلٍ<br>\
[Strong in the withers, hardy, a بازل; that has<br>\
exceeded in age him who has just become a بازل<br>\
by a year, or that has himself just become a<br>\
بازل]. (S, TA.) Some say that الإِخْلَافُ is [a<br>\
term denoting] the last of the ages [that have<br>\
words to signify them] with respect to all beasts.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اخلف فُلَانٌ صَاحِبَهُ: see 3, near the<br>\
middle of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b4-  اخلفهُ مَا وَعَدَهُ, (S,)<br>\
or مَوْعِدَهُ, (Mgh,) or وَعْدَهُ, (Msb,) or الوَعْدَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. إِخْلَافٌ, (Mgh,) He broke, (Mgh,) or<br>\
failed to perform, (S, K,) his promise, or the<br>\
promise, to him: (S, Mgh, K:) restricted to<br>\
future time: (Msb:) الإِخْلَافُ is, in respect of<br>\
the future, like الكَذِبُ in respect of the past:<br>\
(S, K:) or the making a promise and not fulfilling it: (Lh, K:) and some say that it signifies one&#39;s seeking an object of want, or water,<br>\
and not finding it. (TA.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
إِذَا وَعَدَ أَخْلَفَ, i. e. When he promises, he does<br>\
not fulfil his promise, and is not true [to it].<br>\
(TA.) [Hence,] أَخْلَفَتِ النُّجُومُ, i. e. (tropical:)  [The<br>\
stars broke their promise; meaning,] were attended with drought, not attended with rain: (S,<br>\
K, TA:) a saying of the people in the Time of<br>\
Ignorance: (S, TA:) and so عَنْ أَنْوَائِهَا ↓ اِخْتَلَفَتْ:<br>\
for they used to believe and say that they were<br>\
rained upon by such and such a نَوْء. (TA. [See<br>\
نَوْءٌ.]) Hence also, أَخْلَفَتِ الحُمَّى (assumed tropical:)  The fever,<br>\
being tertian or quartan, came not in its time, or<br>\
turn. (Mgh.) And أَخْلَفَتْ said of a she-camel,<br>\
(assumed tropical:) She, having been covered by the stallion, did not<br>\
become pregnant: (JK, TA:) and (assumed tropical:)  she proved<br>\
to be not pregnant when thought to be pregnant.<br>\
(JK.) And in like manner said of a palm-tree;<br>\
(JK;) (tropical:)  It bore not one year: and (tropical:)  it (a tree)<br>\
bore no fruit: or lost the fruit that it had. (L,<br>\
TA. [The verb, said of trees, has also another<br>\
meaning, which see below.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  اخلفهُ is also<br>\
said, by El-Fárábee, to occur as meaning He acted<br>\
according to his promise [or fulfilled his promise]<br>\
to him; thus bearing two contr. significations: but<br>\
this is strange. (MF.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also He found him to be<br>\
a breaker of his promise; (JK;) or he found his<br>\
promise to be broken, or unfulfilled. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
اخلف عَلَيْكَ and لَكَ, each with an objective complement (خَيْرًا or مَالَكَ) expressed or understood:<br>\
see 1, in six places, in the former half of the paragraph. You say also, اخلف فُلَانٌ لِنَفْسِهِ, (S, K,)<br>\
or لِغَيْرِهِ, (TA,) Such a one replaced to himself,<br>\
(S, K,) or to another, (TA,) a thing that had<br>\
gone from him, with another thing. (S, K.)<br>\

فَأَخْلِفْ وَأَتْلِفْ إِنَّمَا المَالُ عَارَةٌ<br>\
وَكُلْهُ مَعَ الدَّهْرِ الَّذِى هُوَ آكِلُهْ<br>\
[Then replace thou, and consume: wealth is but<br>\
a loan: and devour it with time, which is a<br>\
devourer thereof]: he means, gain a substitute<br>\
for what thou hast consumed. (S, TA.) And<br>\
the Arabs say to him who has put on a new<br>\
garment, أَبْلِ وَأَخْلِفْ وَاحْمَدِ الكَاسِى [Wear out<br>\
thy garment, and replace it with another, and<br>\
praise the Clother, meaning God]. (TA.) And<br>\
أَبْلِ وَيُخْلِفُ اللّٰهُ [Wear out thy garment, and<br>\
God will replace it with another; or, may God<br>\
replace &amp;c.]. (S in art. بلو) ―<br>\
-b8-  See also اخلف<br>\
الثَّوْبَ near the end of the first paragraph. ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
اخلف said of a plant, or of herbage, It put forth<br>\
the خِلْفَة, (S, Msb, K,) meaning leaves that come<br>\
forth after the first leaves, in the [season called]<br>\
صَيْف; (TA;) and in like manner said of trees:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) or اخلف الشَّجَرُ means the trees put<br>\
forth fruit after other fruit. (JK.) And, said<br>\
of fruit, It came forth, some thereof after other<br>\
thereof. (TA.) And اخلفت الأَرْضُ The land<br>\
became affected by the cold of the latter part of<br>\
the [season called] صَيْف, and some of its trees<br>\
consequently become green. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  Also, said<br>\
of a bird, (tropical:)  It put forth feathers after the first<br>\
feathers: (K, TA:) from the same verb said of<br>\
a plant, or of herbage. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  And, said of a<br>\
boy, (assumed tropical:)  He nearly attained to puberty. (JK, Az.<br>\
K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b12-  And, said of a solid-hoofed beast,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He completed a year after the قُرُوح [or finishing teething, or shedding the corner-nipper].<br>\
(JK.)<br>\
-A2-  اخلفهُ said of medicine, It weakened<br>\
him (K, TA) by causing him to go frequently to<br>\
the privy. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And الإِخْلَافُ also signifies<br>\
The bringing the stallion again to the she-camel<br>\
when she has not conceived at once. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  See<br>\
also 1, in six places, in the latter half of the paragraph.<br>\
5<br>\
تَخَلَّفَ see 1, in two places, in the middle of the<br>\

تَخَاْلَفَ see the next paragraph, in three places.<br>\
8<br>\
اِخْتِلَافٌ signifies The following reciprocally;<br>\
or alternating. (Mgh.) So in the phrase in the<br>\
Kur [ii. 159 and iii. 187 and xlv. 4], وَاخْتِلَافِ<br>\
اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارِ And the alternating of the night and<br>\
the day. (Mgh) [And in a verse of El-&#39;Ajjáj<br>\
cited voce أَبْلَى, in art. بلو.] And hence the<br>\
phrase, اِخْتَلَفَا ضَرْبَةً Each of them beat, or struck<br>\
the other in turn. (Mgh.) And the saying, in a<br>\
trad. of &#39;Alee, فَاخْتَلَفَتْ بَيْنَ عُبَيْدَةَ بْنِ الحٰرِثِ<br>\
وَالوَلِيدِ بْنِ عُقْبَةَ ضَرْبَتَانِ [And two blows were interchanged between &#39;Obeydeh Ibn-El-Hárith and<br>\

going; or reciprocating; syn. تَرَدُّدٌ [in this sense,<br>\

the S and K in art. رود &amp;c.: and also as mean<br>\
ing the returning, or repairing, time after time,<br>\
or repeatedly, or frequently, to a person or place;<br>\
because it implies coming and going: and sometimes it means simply the returning; because this<br>\
cannot be without a previous going]. (K.) You say,<br>\
هُوَ يَخْتَلِفُ إِلَى فُلَانٍ, i. e. يَتَرَدَّدُ [He returns, or<br>\
repairs, time after time, repeatedly, or frequently,<br>\

looseness of the bowels, or a diarrhœa]. (K.)<br>\
And [perhaps as implying coming and going,]<br>\
اختلف also signifies He supplied, or gave, or<br>\

differing, or varying, in state or condition or<br>\
quality &amp;c.; being dissimilar, different, diverse,<br>\
various, incongruous, discordant, or dissentient:]<br>\
اختلف is the contr. of اِتَّفَقَ; (K, TA;) and is<br>\
said of anything that is dissimilar [in the parts or<br>\
members &amp;c. of which it is composed]; as also<br>\
↓ تخالف. (TA.) You say, الأَمْرَانِ ↓ تخالف [and<br>\
اختلف الامران], i. e. لَمْ يَتَّفِقَا [The two things,<br>\
or affairs, or cases, were, or became, dissimilar,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (TA.) And اختلفوا and ↓ تخالفوا (Mgh,<br>\
Msb) [They disagreed, &amp;c., فِى أَمْرٍ in a thing or<br>\
an affair or a case;] every one of them took to,<br>\
or held, a way, or an opinion, different from, or<br>\
contrary to, that of another: (Msb:) both signify the same. (Mgh.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
سَوُّوا صُفُوفَكُمْ وَلَا تَخْتَلِفُوا فَتَخْتَلِفَ قُلُوبُكُمْ [Make<br>\
ye your ranks even when ye place yourselves to<br>\
pray together, and be not dissimilar in your<br>\
positions, for in that case your hearts would disagree]; meaning, when one of you advances, or<br>\
stands, before another in the ranks, your hearts<br>\
will be affected, and disagreement in respect of<br>\
friendship and amity will arise among you: or,<br>\
as some say, it means, your hearts will be made<br>\
to recoil: or the صُورَة [or specific character] of<br>\
your hearts will become changed into another<br>\
صورة. (TA.) [Hence,] اِخْتَلَفَتْ عَنْ أَنْوَائِهَا, said<br>\
of stars: see 4, near the middle of the paragraph.<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Also The being complicated, intricate, or confused. (KL.) [You say, اختلف الأَمْرُ بَيْنَهُمْ The<br>\
affair, or case, was, or became, complicated, intricate, or confused, so as to be a subject of disagreement, or difference, between them: a phrase<br>\
of frequent occurrence.]<br>\

took it (a thing) as a substitute, or in exchange,<br>\

-A2-  See also 1, in<br>\
the middle of the latter half of the paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
خَلْفٌ [meaning The location, or quarter, that<br>\
is behind; and the time past;] (K; [so in my<br>\
MS. copy, and thus it should be written as a<br>\
simple noun; but in the CK خَلْفُ;]) or الخَلْفُ;<br>\
(Lth, K;) contr. of قُدَّامٌ [or القُدَّامُ]: (Lth, K:)<br>\
[and] خَلْفَ [Behind; and after;] contr. of<br>\
قُدَّامَ: (S: [thus in my tow copies; and said in<br>\
the margin of one of them to be thus in the copy<br>\
of IB, and in that of El-Jawáleekee:]) a simple<br>\
noun: and an adv. n.: of the fem. gender [as<br>\
meaning the جِهَة; but otherwise it seems to be<br>\
masc.]. (TA.) You say, جَآءَ خَلْفَهُ [and مِنْ<br>\
خَلْفِهِ, both meaning He came behind him, and<br>\
after him]. (Mgh.) And جَلَسْتُ خَلْفَ فُلَانٍ I<br>\
sat after, or behind, such a one; syn. بَعْدَهُ (S.)<br>\
And لَبِثَ خَلْفَهُ He remained after him. (K.)<br>\
Some read, in the Kur [xvii. 78], وَإِذًا لَايَلْبَثُونَ<br>\
خَلْفَكَ: others read خِلَافَكَ [which means the<br>\
same, as mentioned above: see the middle of the<br>\
first paragraph of this art.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  خَلْفٌ signifies also The back (K, TA) itself: so says IAar:<br>\
and particularly, of a house; the side corresponding<br>\
to, or over against, that in which is the door;<br>\
and as a house may have two doors, [in two different sides,] it may be said to have two backs,<br>\
each of which may be thus termed; and the dual<br>\
of this word seems to be used as meaning two<br>\
backs in a trad. [respecting the building of the<br>\
Kaabeh]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And One who comes after<br>\
another; (S, TA;) as also ↓ خَلَفٌ, or, accord. to<br>\
some, there is a difference between these two, as<br>\
will be shown in what follows; (S;) and ↓ خَالِفٌ<br>\
and ↓ خَالِفَةٌ: it is originally an inf. n.: (TA:)<br>\
and signifies one who remains after another,<br>\
whether this other be dead or living: and one<br>\
remaining after another who is dead; his follower, or successor; the follower, or successor, of<br>\
one who has gone: used in praise and in dispraise:<br>\
pl. خُلُوفٌ: and the sing. also signifies [like the<br>\
pl.] persons remaining after others; accord. to<br>\
some: (IB, TA:) a remnant of people: (Lh,<br>\
TA:) and a generation after a generation; (Lth,<br>\
S, K;) as also ↓ خَلَفٌ: (Lth, TA:) but Lth says<br>\
that the former is applied to the evil, and ↓ the<br>\
latter to the good, (K, TA,) whether meaning a<br>\
generation or a son: (TA:) the latter means<br>\
a good son (K, TA) remaining after his father:<br>\
(TA:) and the former, a bad son: (K, TA:)<br>\
[therefore] one says, هُوَ خَلْفُ سَوْءٍ مِنْ أَبِيهِ [He is<br>\
a bad son] who has taken the place of his father,<br>\
and صِدْقٍ من ابيه ↓ خَلَفُ [a good son] &amp;c.: (S:)<br>\
but sometimes each is used in the place of the<br>\
other; so that one says, هو خَلْفُ صِدْقٍ من ابيه:<br>\
(K:) or both signify the same: (S, K:) so says<br>\
Akh: some, he says, use the former; and some,<br>\
the latter: but some say صِدْقٍ ↓ خَلَفُ and خَلْفُ<br>\
سَوْءٍ, meaning thus to distinguish between them:<br>\
(S:) accord. to IB, ↓ خَلَفٌ correctly signifies a<br>\
man&#39;s successor who is a substitute for him, good<br>\
and bad: and is originally an inf. n.: (TA:) and<br>\
the pl. of this is أَخْلَافٌ: (AZ, IB, TA:) accord.<br>\
to IAth, خَلَفُ صِدْقٍ means a good generation:<br>\
and خَلْفُ سَوْءٍ, an evil generation: (TA:) and<br>\
خَلْفٌ likewise signifies progeny [without restriction]. (K.) One says also, (S, K,) of a<br>\
people following people more in number than<br>\
they, (S,) هٰؤُلَآءِ خَلْفُ سَوْءٍ [These are a bad generation. (S, K.) And بَقِينَا فِى خَلْفِ سَوْءٍ We<br>\
remained among an evil remnant. (Lh, TA.)<br>\
And فَخَلَفَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ, in the Kur [vii. 168<br>\
and xix. 60], is explained as meaning And there<br>\
remained after them a remnant. (TA.) ―<br>\

mountains; (K) like as one says ذِئْبُ غَضًا. (S.)<br>\
-A5-  And A sharp arrow: (AHn, K:) or, accord.<br>\
to Skr, the word in this sense is حَلِيفٌ, with the<br>\
unpointed ح; and this is more probably correct.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
خَلَافَةٌ: see خُلْفَةٌ.<br>\
خِلَافَةٌ inf. n. of خَلَفَهُ as meaning “ he was, or<br>\
became, his خَلِيفَة ” [q. v.]. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence, as a simple subst., The office of<br>\
خَلِيفَة.]<br>\
خَلِيفَةٌ A successor: and a vice-agent, vice-<br>\
gerent, lieutenant, substitute, proxy, or deputy:<br>\
(KL:) one who has been made, or appointed, to<br>\
take the place of him who has been before him:<br>\
(JK:) an act. part. n. of خَلَفَهُ, inf. n. خَلَفٌ and<br>\
خِلَافَةٌ; as also ↓ خَلِيفٌ: (TA:) or it may have<br>\
the meaning of an act. part. n. or that of a pass.<br>\
part. n.: and so in the sense next following:<br>\
(Msb:) the supreme, or greatest, ruler or sovereign, (S, Msb, K, TA,) who supplies the place of<br>\
him who has been before him; (TA;) [particularly the successor of the Prophet; whence<br>\
“ Caliph,” commonly used by English writers<br>\
for “ Khaleefeh; ”] as also ↓ خَلِيفٌ, (K,) which<br>\
is the original form, (Msb,) without ة; (Msb,<br>\
TA;) disapproved by some, but mentioned by<br>\
AHát and Ibn-&#39; Abbád and IB, and occurring in<br>\
a verse of Ows Ibn-Hajar cited by IB: (TA:)<br>\
the ة in the former is to denote intensiveness of<br>\
signification, (Nh, Msb, TA,) as in عَلَّامَةٌ and<br>\
نَسَّابَةٌ: (Msb:) or, as some say, لِلنَّقْلِ [i. e. for<br>\
the transference of the word from the category of<br>\
epithets to that of substs.]: (TA:) it is also said<br>\
that the word may be an epithet of which the<br>\
subst. qualified thereby is suppressed, for نَفْسٌ<br>\
خَلِيفَةٌ; but this requires consideration: (MF,<br>\
TA:) it is an epithet applied to a man peculiarly:<br>\
(Msb:) some make it fem.; (Fr, S, Msb, K;)<br>\
saying هٰذَا خَلِيفَةٌ أُخْرَى [This is another Khaleefeh]; though the proper way is to make it<br>\
masc.: (Msb:) a poet says,<br>\
أَبُوكَ خَلِيفَةٌ وَلَدَتْهُ أُخْرَى<br>\
وَأَنْتَ خَلِيفَةٌ ذَاكَ الكَمَالُ<br>\
[Thy father was a Khaleefeh, whom another<br>\
Khaleefeh begat; and thou art a Khaleefeh:<br>\
that is perfection]: (Fr, S:) the pl. is خَلَائِفُ<br>\
[generally applied to any people that have succeeded others, and supplied their places, as in the<br>\
Kur x. 15], (S, K,) like as كَرَائِمُ is pl. of كَرِيمَةٌ;<br>\
(S;) and خُلَفَآءُ [generally applied to successors<br>\
of the Prophet], (S, K,) because, as it applies<br>\
only to the male, and has ة added, the ة is dropped<br>\
in forming the pl., which is thus like ظُرَفَآءُ as pl.<br>\
of ظَرِيفٌ: (S:) thus says ISk, and the like is<br>\
said in the O: but what AHát and Ibn-&#39;Abbád<br>\
say requires not this straining: (TA:) [i. e.]<br>\
خَلَائِفُ is pl. of خَلِيفَةٌ; and خُلَفَآءُ, of ↓ خَلِيفٌ:<br>\
(JK:) or some, having regard to the original,<br>\
make the pl. to be خُلَفَآءُ, like as شُرَفَآءُ is pl. of<br>\
شَرِيفٌ; (Msb;) and this pl. is masc. only, so<br>\
that you say ثَلَاثَةٌ خُلَفَآءَ: (ISk, Msb, TA:) and<br>\
some, having regard to the word itself [in its<br>\
altered and used state], make the pl. to be<br>\
خَلَائِفُ; (Msb;) and this pl. may have prefixed to it either a masc. or a fem. n. of number,<br>\
so that you say ثَلَاثَةٌ خَلَائِفَ and ثَلَاثُ خَلَائِفَ;<br>\
(ISk, Msb, TA;) both of which are chaste.<br>\
(Msb.) You say, كَانَ اللّٰهُ خَلِيفَةَ وَالِدِكَ عَلَيْكَ<br>\
[May God be to thee a supplier of the place of<br>\
thy father]: (S, Msb: *) and in like manner you<br>\
say, to a person, of any one whom he has lost by<br>\
death, (S, Msb,) and who cannot be replaced; as<br>\
the paternal uncle; (Msb;) or the mother. (K.)<br>\
Some say that the application of the title خَلِيفَةُ<br>\
اللّٰهِ [The Vicegerent of God] is not allowable, except to Adam and David because there is express<br>\
authority in these instances [in the Kur ii. 28 and<br>\
xxxviii. 25]; but others allow it in other cases,<br>\
like سُلْطَانُ اللّٰهِ and جُنُودُ اللّٰهِ and حِزْبُ اللّٰهِ and<br>\
خَيْلُ اللّٰهِ; all of which have been heard: (Msb:)<br>\
and Zj says that it is allowable to say of the<br>\
Imáms that they are خُلَفَآءُ اللّٰهِ فِى أَرْضِهِ [The<br>\
Vicegerents of God in his earth]. (TA.)<br>\
خِلِّيفَةٌ: see the middle of the next paragraph.<br>\

paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also One who remains behind, or<br>\
after, another, (Yz, K, TA,) or others, in the<br>\
case of a war, or a warring and plundering expedition, and in other cases: (TA:) pl. خَالِفُونَ<br>\
(Yz, K, TA) and خَوَالِفُ, which latter is extr. [in<br>\
this case], but is also said to be a [reg.] pl. of<br>\
↓ خَالِفَةٌ, and as such to signify persons who do not<br>\
go forth on a warring, or warring and plundering, expedition: and الغَازِى ↓ خَالِفَةُ signifies he<br>\
who remains behind, or after, him who goes forth<br>\
on such an expedition, being of his family. (TA.)<br>\
فَاقْعُدُوا مَعَ الخَالِفِينَ, in the Kur [ix. 84], means<br>\
Then stay ye with those who remain behind. (Yz,<br>\
K. *) خَوَالِفُ is also pl. of ↓ خَالِفَةٌ [as fem. of<br>\
خَالِفٌ], (TA,) and signifies Women (K, TA) remaining behind in the houses or tents: but some<br>\
assign to it the first of the meanings explained<br>\
above: and some say that it means the children<br>\
remaining behind. (TA.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[ix. 88 and 94], ↓ رَضُوا بِأَنْ يَكُونُوا مَعَ الخَوَالِفِ,<br>\
i. e. [They chose to be] with the women: (S, K: *)<br>\
thus it is explained by Ibn-&#39;Arafeh: but some<br>\
say that the meaning is, with the bad, or corrupt,<br>\
persons; and that خوالف is here a pl. [of خَالِفٌ,]<br>\
like فَوَارِسُ. (TA.) For ―<br>\
-b3-  خَالِفٌ is applied to a<br>\
man [as meaning Bad, or corrupt]; and ↓ خَالِفَةٌ<br>\
to a woman as meaning bad, or corrupt, and<br>\
remaining behind in her abode: and the former<br>\
to a slave as meaning bad, or corrupt: and also<br>\
contrarious: and in this last sense it is likewise<br>\
applied to a companion: and some of the grammarians say that there is no word of the measure<br>\
فَاعِلٌ having its pl. of the measure فَوَاعِلُ, except<br>\
خَالِفٌ and هَالِكٌ and فَارِسٌ: but see this last:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ خِلِّيفَةٌ, also, has this last signification; (JK, TA;) or [rather] signifies very contrarious; (K;) as also ↓ خَالِفَةٌ; (JK;) and so<br>\
↓ خِلَفْنَةٌ, and ↓ خِلَفْنَاةٌ, (Lh, JK, K,) in each of<br>\
which the ن is augmentative, and each of which<br>\
is applied to a man and to a woman and to a pl.<br>\
number; (Lh, K;) but خِلَفْنَيَاتٌ has been mentioned as pl. [of خلفناة], and as applied to males<br>\
and females: (TA:) and خَالِفُونَ is likewise used<br>\
in this sense applied to a number of men. (JK.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Also, applied to a slave, [and app. to any<br>\
man, but in this latter case I find it written خلف,<br>\
which I believe to be a mistranscription,] One<br>\
who has withdrawn from the people of his house:<br>\
so says Lh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also Stupid; foolish; or<br>\
having little, or no, intellect or understanding;<br>\
as also ↓ خَالِفَةٌ, (K, TA,) but in an intensive<br>\
sense, and also applied to a woman; (TA;) and<br>\
↓ أَخْلَفُ, (JK, K,) of which the fem. is خَلْفَآءُ;<br>\
(JK, TA;) and ↓ خُلْفُفٌ, (K,) or ↓ خُلْفَفٌ, (L,)<br>\
or both, (JK,) likewise applied to a woman, as<br>\
also ↓ خُلْفُفَةٌ, (K,) or ↓ خُلْفَفَةٌ: (JK:) or, as<br>\
some say, خَالِفٌ signifies one in whom is no good:<br>\
and, as also ↓ خَالِفَةٌ, one who has not what suffices:<br>\
or who often breaks his promises: (TA:) or both<br>\
of these mean one who has not what suffices, and<br>\
in whom is no good: or very contrarious. (JM.)<br>\
One says that a man is أَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ ↓ خَالِفَةُ and خَالِفُ,<br>\
اهل بيته, meaning The one in whom is no good,<br>\
of the people of his house: (S, K:) and the<br>\
ungenerous: (K:) or the stupid, or foolish: or<br>\
the bad, or corrupt, and the evil: and it is [said<br>\
to be] tropical. (TA.) And ↓ قَوْمٌ خَوَالِفٌ Persons in whom is no good. (JK.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And, [app.<br>\
because he leaves his family behind him,] A<br>\
drawer of water; (S, TA;) as also ↓ مُسْتَخْلِفٌ<br>\
[q. v.]: both mentioned in the K; but السَّقَّآءُ is<br>\
there erroneously put for المُسْتَقِى. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
And Weak, without appetite for food. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
And Flesh-meat from which a slight smell is perceived, but in the chewing of which is no harm.<br>\
(Lth, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also خُلْفٌ.<br>\
خَالِفَةٌ: see خَلْفٌ, in the former half of the<br>\
paragraph. Also, particularly, [or perhaps أُمَّةٌ<br>\
خَالِفَةٌ only in this sense,] A nation, people, or<br>\
race, remaining after another that has gone<br>\
before. (I &#39;Abbád, K.) And One who comes to<br>\
the water after him who has returned [from it]:<br>\
whence Aboo-Bekr applied this appellation to<br>\
himself, from a motive of humility, when asked<br>\
if he were the Khaleefeh of the Apostle of God.<br>\
(IAth, TA.) See also خَالِفٌ, in eight places: and<br>\
see its pl., خَوَالِفُ, in the same paragraph, in two<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, applied to a man, [like خِلِّيفَةٌ as<br>\
explained in the K,] Very contrarious, or adverse,<br>\
and inimical. (S, * K, * TA.) See also خِلْفٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
مَا أَدْرِى أَىُّ خَالِفَةَ هُوَ, the word خالفة being here<br>\
imperfectly decl., (S, K,) because of the fem.<br>\
gender and determinate, being explained by النَّاسِ,<br>\
(S,) or because determinate and occupying the<br>\
place of a pl., like as one says أَىُّ تَمِيمَ and<br>\
أَىُّ أَسَدَ, [or rather, I think, because used as a<br>\
proper name, as MF, says, (though SM disputes<br>\
this,) and with the sign of the fem. gender,]<br>\
means I know not what one of mankind he is;<br>\
(S, K;) as also أَىُّ خَالِفَةٍ, perfectly decl.; and<br>\
أَىُّ الخَالِفَةِ; and أَىُّ الخَوَالِفِ; (K;) and so<br>\
أَىُّ خَافِيَةَ; (K, TA, [in the CK اىّ خَالِفَةٍ again,])<br>\
imperfectly decl. (TA.) Lh says that الخَالِفَةُ,<br>\
writing it thus with ال, signifies النَّاسُ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also One of the poles of a [tent of the kind<br>\
called] خِبَآء: or one of the poles of a بَيْت [or<br>\
tent] in the hinder part thereof: (K:) Lh says<br>\
that the خَالِفَة is the hinder part, or in the hinder<br>\
part, (اَخر, [i. e. آخِرُ or آخِرَ, app. the latter,]) of<br>\
a بَيْت; and one says بَيْتٌ ذُو خَالِفَتَيْنِ [app.<br>\
meaning a tent having two poles in its hinder<br>\
part]: (TA:) the pl. is خَوَالِفُ: (S, TA:) which<br>\
is hence applied to the angles, or corners, of a<br>\
بَيْت: AZ says that the خَالِفَة of a بيت is [app.<br>\
the shirt thereof,] beneath the [ropes called]<br>\
أَطْنَاب, in the [part called] كِسْر [q. v.]; and it<br>\
is also called the خياصة, and the فرجة: [thus I<br>\
find these two words written, without any syll.<br>\
signs:] and he cites, as an ex.,<br>\
مَا خِفْتُ حَتَّى هَتَكُوا الخَوَالِفَ<br>\
[app. meaning And I feared not until they rent<br>\
open the skirts of the tent, or tents]: (TA:) or,<br>\
as some say, the خَالِفَتَانِ are the two sides of a tent,<br>\
and its رِوَاق is its fore part, and its كِفَآء is its<br>\
hinder part. (TA in art. روق.) ―<br>\

one side: (K:) and [simply] leaning towards<br>\

-b3-  Also<br>\
A camel that has the sheath of his penis slit, and<br>\
that will not remain stationary, by reason of<br>\
pain: (TA:) and ↓ مَخْلُوفٌ signifies a camel<br>\

part, (JK, TA,) when suffering suppression of his<br>\
urine in consequence of the pressure of his hind<br>\
girth upon his sheath: so says El-Fezáree. (TA.)<br>\

the course of a wolf in a narrow road to the<br>\
course of the أَخْلَف.]<br>\
