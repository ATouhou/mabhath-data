ذُو الخَلَصَةِ, (S, K,) and ذو الخُلُصَةِ, (Hishám,<br>\
K,) and ذو الخَلْصَةِ, accord. to IDrd, and some<br>\
write it ذو الخَلُصَةِ, but the first is the form commonly obtaining with the relaters of trads., (TA,)<br>\
A certain temple, (S, K,) called كَعْبَةُ اليَمَامَةِ, (S,)<br>\
or الكَعْبَةُ اليَمَانِيَّةُ, (El-Háfidh Ibn-Hajar, K,) and<br>\

and Dows and Bejeeleh and others, (TA,) in<br>\
which was an idol called الخَلَصَةُ, (S, K,) which<br>\
was demolished (S, TA) by command of Mohammad: (TA:) or ذُو الخَلَصَةِ was the idol itself,<br>\
as some say; but, says IAth, this requires consideration, because [it is asserted that] ذو is not prefixed to any but generic names: (TA: [but see<br>\
ذُو:]) or the temple was so called because it was<br>\
the place of growth of a tree of a kind called<br>\
↓ خَلَص. (K, * TA.)<br>\

خِلَاصٌ: see خُلَاصَة, throughout.<br>\
خُلُوصٌ: see خُلَاصَة, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
an inf. n. of 1.<br>\
خُلَيْصٌ: see خَالِصٌ.<br>\
خُلَاصَةُ السَّمْنِ (S, A, L, Msb, K) and خِلَاصَتُهُ<br>\
(Fr, Sgh, K) What has become clear, of cooked<br>\
butter; (S, A, L, K;) or cooked butter into which<br>\
some dates have been thrown, or into which some<br>\
سَوِيق [i. e. meal of parched barley or wheat] has<br>\
been thrown, in order that thereby it may become<br>\
clear from the remains of the milk: (Msb:) for<br>\
when they cook fresh butter, to make it سَمْن, they<br>\
throw into it somewhat of سويق, or dates, or<br>\
globules of gazelles&#39; dung; and when it becomes<br>\
good, and clear from the dregs, or sediment, that<br>\
سمن is called الخُلَاصَةُ, and ↓ الخِلَاصُ also, (S,<br>\
L,) mentioned by A&#39;Obeyd, (S,) and this, namely<br>\
the خِلَاص, is the إِثْر: (S, L, K:) and the terms<br>\
↓ خُلُوصٌ (S, L, K) and قِلْدَةٌ (S, L) and قِشْدَةٌ (S,<br>\
L, K) and كُدَادَةٌ (S, L) are applied to the dregs,<br>\
or sediment, remaining at the bottom; (S, L, K;)<br>\
as also خُلَاصَةٌ: (AHeyth, L in art. قشد:) the<br>\
inf. n. is إِخْلَاصٌ; and you say, أَخْلَصْتُ السَّمْنَ: (S,<br>\
L:) or خُلَاصَةٌ and ↓ خِلَاصٌ signify dates and<br>\
سويق that are thrown into سمن; and اخلص<br>\
السَّمْنَ signifies “he threw dates and سويق into<br>\
the سمن [and so clarified it]:” and ↓ خُلَاصٌ<br>\
[thus I find it written] signifies what has become<br>\
clear, of سمن, when it is cooked: and خِلَاصٌ<br>\
also signifies, and so ↓ إِخْلَاصٌ, and ↓ أِخْلَاصَةٌ,<br>\
butter when clear from the dregs, or sediment:<br>\
and ↓ خُلُوصٌ, the dregs, or sediment, at the<br>\
bottom of the milk: (L:) ↓ إِخْلَاصٌ and ↓ إِخْلَاصَةٌ<br>\
are syn. with إِذْوَابٌ and إِذْوَابَةٌ: (TA:) or, accord.<br>\
to AZ, the latter two terms are applied to butter<br>\
when it is put into the cooking-pot to be cooked<br>\
into سمن; and when it has become good, and the<br>\
milk has become clear from the dregs, or sediment,<br>\
that milk is called إِثْرٌ and ↓ إِخْلَاضٌ: Az says, I<br>\
have heard the Arabs apply the term ↓ خِلَاصٌ to<br>\
that with which سمن is cleared, in the cookingpot, from the water and milk and dregs; for<br>\
when it is not clear, and the milk is mixed with<br>\
the butter, they take dates, or flour, or سويق,<br>\
which they throw therein, that the سمن may<br>\
become clear from the remains of the milk mixed<br>\
with it: this is the خِلَاص: but the خلاصة [i. e.<br>\
خُلَاصَة] is what remains, of the خِلَاص and dregs<br>\
or milk &amp;c., in the bottom of the cooking-pot: (L,<br>\
TA:) [or] ↓ خِلَاصٌ (K) [accord. to some, ↓ خَلَاصٌ,<br>\
but this is app. wrong, (see Har p. 311,)] and<br>\
خُلَاصَةٌ (Hr, TA) also signify what fire has clarified, or purified, (مَا أَخْلَصَتْهُ النَّارُ,) of butter,<br>\
and of gold, and of silver: (Hr, K, TA:) or<br>\
اللَّبَنِ ↓ خِلَاصُ, means what is extracted from<br>\
milk; i. e. butter; (ADk, L, TA;) and so does<br>\
خُلَاصَةُ اللَّبَنِ: (A: [but there mentioned among<br>\
tropical expressions:]) خُلَاصَةٌ being applied in<br>\
the manner first mentioned in this paragraph, by<br>\
a secondary application is made to signify what is<br>\
clear, or pure, of other things; (Msb;) [as also<br>\
↓ خَالِصٌ: and hence both of them often signify<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  the choice, best, or most excellent, part of anything; and so, probably, does ↓ خِلَاصٌ:] and<br>\
خُلَاصَةٌ and ↓ خُلَاصٌ also signify Inspissated juice<br>\
(رُبّ) made from dates; (JK;) or this is called<br>\
↓ خُلُوصٌ. (TA.)<br>\
خَالِصٌ Clear; pure; sheer; free from admixture; unmingled; unmixed; genuine: (B,<br>\
TA:) clear, or pure, applied to any colour: (Lh,<br>\
TA:) (tropical:)  white; as also ↓ خُلَيْصٌ; [which latter<br>\
appears to me doubtful, though I know not why<br>\
Freytag has substituted for this, or for the former<br>\
word, خَلْصٌ;] both applied to anything. (K, TA.)<br>\
You say, ثَوْبٌ خَالِصٌ (tropical:)  A garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth, of a clear, or pure, white: and قَبَآءٌ أَزْرَقُ خَالِصُ<br>\
البِطَانَةِ (tropical:)  A garment of the kind called قباء blue<br>\
with a white lining. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also (assumed tropical:)  Pure, or<br>\
sincere, love, religion, &amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b3-  See also خُلَاصَة,<br>\
near the end of the paragraph.<br>\
خَالِصَةٌ [fem. of خَالِصٌ: used as a subst.,] (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
pure property, or quality. (Bd in xxxviii. 46;<br>\
and K. [In the CK, خُلَّة is erroneously put for<br>\
خَلَّة: the corresponding word in Bd is خَصْلَة.])<br>\
So in the Kur [xxxviii. 46], بِخَالِصَةٍ ↓ أَخْلَصْنَاهُمْ<br>\
ذِكْرَى الدَّارِ (assumed tropical:)  We have rendered them pure by a<br>\
pure quality, (Bd, K, * TA,) the keeping in<br>\
memory the final abode: (Bd, TA:) ذكرى الدار<br>\
being a substitute for خالصة: or it may mean<br>\
[by] their keeping in memory much the final<br>\
abode and the return to God: (TA:) some also,<br>\
(TA,) namely Náfi&#39; and Hishám, (Bd,) read<br>\
بِخَالِصَةِ, making it a prefix to ذكرى (Bd, TA)<br>\
as an explicative; or an inf. n., in the sense of<br>\
خُلُوص, prefixed to its agent. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say<br>\
also, هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ خَالِصَةٌ لَكَ (assumed tropical:)  This thing is a property of thine: (so in a copy of the S, and so<br>\
the phrase is written in the TA:) or is a thing<br>\
purely thine, exclusively of others: (TA:) or<br>\
هذا الشىء خَالِصَةً لَكَ this thing is particularly,<br>\
or specially, thine, or for thee. (So accord. to<br>\
other copies of the S, and a copy of the JK.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  See also خِلْصٌ.<br>\
-A2-  خَالِصَةٌ is also syn. with<br>\
إِخْلَاصٌ [in some sense not pointed out: see the<br>\
latter below; and see also 4]. (TA.)<br>\
إِخْلَاصٌ [inf. n. of 4, used as a subst.]: see<br>\
خُلَاصَة, in three places.<br>\
إِخْلَاصَةٌ: see خُلَاصَة, in two places.<br>\

escape from an event.]<br>\
مُخْلَصٌ Chosen: (JK:) chosen by God, and<br>\
pure from pollution; applied to a man. (Zj,<br>\
TA.) [It is implied in the A and TA that it is<br>\
also syn. with مُخْلِصٌ in the sense explained<br>\
below.]<br>\
مُخْلِصٌ (tropical:)  Pure, or sincere, towards God in<br>\
religion; without hypocrisy: (TA:) or purely<br>\
