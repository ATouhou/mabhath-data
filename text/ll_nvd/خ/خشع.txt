خَشَعَ, aor.<br>\
خَشَعَ, inf. n. خُشُوعٌ, He was, or<br>\
became, lowly, humble, or submissive; (S, Msb,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ اختشع (S, K) and ↓ تخشّع; (Abu-lFet-h, Ham pp. 24 and 127;) خُشُوعٌ being syn.<br>\
with خُضُوعٌ: (S, Msb, K:) or خشوع is nearly<br>\
the same as خضوع: (Lth, K:) or the former is<br>\
mostly used as meaning in the voice; and the<br>\
latter, in the necks: (Msb:) or the latter is in<br>\
the body; and the former is in the voice and in<br>\
the eyes: (K:) or, as we read in the &#39;Eyn, the<br>\
former is nearly the same as the latter, except that<br>\
the latter is in the body, and signifies the acknowledging of humility and submission, and the<br>\
former is in the voice and in the eyes; and the<br>\
like is said in the Nh [and in the Msb in art.<br>\
خضع]. (TA.) You say, خَشَعَتِ الأَصْوَاتُ The<br>\
voices were [or shall be (as in the Kur xx. 107])<br>\
