K,) or what is termed حِسّ [i. e. a low, faint,<br>\
gentle, or soft, sound], (S,) and an audible motion: (S, L:) said of a man: and said also of<br>\
snow, as meaning it caused one to hear a [sound<br>\
such as is termed] خَشْفَة in walking [upon it];<br>\
as is the case in intense cold. (S.) And خَشَفَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
خَشِفَ, inf. n. خُشُوفٌ, said of snow, It was rough,<br>\

to IB, the right reading is, بِسُحْرَةٍ [a little before<br>\

made to be redundant, and because it is prefixed<br>\

approved way in a case of this kind, when the<br>\
verb commencing the proposition is a pret.; but<br>\
