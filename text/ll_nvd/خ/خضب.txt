خَضَبَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
خَضِبَ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. خَضْبٌ (S, Msb) [and accord. to MF<br>\
خِضَابٌ and خُضُوبٌ, but respecting these two<br>\
inf. ns. (the latter of which seems to be peculiar<br>\
to the intrans. verb خَضَبَ) see what follows],<br>\
He coloured, or tinged, (A, K,) a thing; (S, A, *<br>\
K; *) or changed it in colour to red, or yellow,<br>\
&amp;c.; (TA;) and ↓ خضّب signifies the same, [but<br>\
app. in an intensive sense, or as applying to a<br>\
number of objects, (see its pass. part. n. voce<br>\
خَضِيبٌ,)] (K,) inf. n. تَخْضِيبٌ: (TA:) and the<br>\
former, particularly, he tinged, or dyed, his white<br>\
hair, (TA,) or the hand, &amp;c., (Msb,) with hinnà:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) but when a man has dyed his hair<br>\
with any other dye than hinnà, you say, صَبَغَ<br>\
شَعَرَهُ: (Msb, TA:) or you say also, خَضَبَ بِالسَّوَادِ<br>\
[He dyed his hair with black]. (Suh, TA.)<br>\
When one does not mention the hair (Msb, TA)<br>\
or the white hair [&amp;c.], (Msb,) he says خَضَبَ,<br>\
inf. n. خِضَابٌ; (IKtt, Msb;) and ↓ اختضب, (S,<br>\
IKtt, Msb, TA,) and ↓ تخضّب; (A, TA;)<br>\
[meaning He dyed his hair, &amp;c.,] with hinnà,<br>\
(S, IKtt, Msb, TA,) and the like: (S, TA:) and<br>\
in like manner one says of a woman, خَضَبَتْ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
خَضِبَ; and ↓ اختضب: (TA:) which last also<br>\
signifies [particularly] She dyed her hands with<br>\
hinnà. (T, TS, TA, in art. غمس.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, in<br>\
a trad., بَكَى حَتَّى خَضَبَ دَمْعُهُ الحَصَى (tropical:)  He wept<br>\
so that his tears wetted the pebbles: or, more<br>\
probably, so that his tears became red, and dyed<br>\
the pebbles: (IAth, TA:) [or most probably, so<br>\
that his tears caused the pebbles to appear of a<br>\
reddish colour; for such is commonly the case<br>\
when pebbles are wetted.]<br>\
-A2-  خَضَبَ, aor.<br>\
خَضِبَ; and<br>\
خَضِبَ, aor.<br>\
خَضَبَ; and خُضِبَ; inf. n. of each<br>\
خُضُوبٌ; and ↓ اخضوضب; (tropical:)  It (a tree) became<br>\
green. (K, TA.) And خَضَبَ, inf. n. خُضُوبٌ,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Its small leaves came forth in the spring, and<br>\
its twigs lengthened; said of the قَتَاد, at the commencement of its vegetation; and likewise of the<br>\
عَرْفَج and عَوْسَج; but of no other tree of the kind<br>\
called عِضَاه: or said also of the عُرْفُط and سَمُر;<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  it dropped its leaves, and became red<br>\
and yellow: (TA:) and you say also, خَضَبَتِ<br>\
العِضَاهُ (tropical:)  the عضاه became green, and broke forth;<br>\
(A;) or the sap of the عضاه flowed in their<br>\
branches, and they became green; as also<br>\
↓ أَخْضَبَتْ, (TA,) for which اخصبت, with the<br>\
unpointed ص, is said by Az to be a gross mistranscription; explained by Lth, on whose authority it is written with ص, [as also in the K<br>\
in art. خصب,] as meaning the sap flowed in the<br>\
branches of the عضاه so as to reach the roots.<br>\
(T and TA in art. خصب.) And خَصَبَ النَّخْلُ,<br>\
(S, K,) inf. n. خَضْبٌ, (K,) The palm-trees, (S,)<br>\
or the spadices of the palm-trees, (K,) became<br>\
green. (S, K.) And خَضَبَتِ الأَرْضُ, (A, K,)<br>\
inf. n. خَضْبٌ; (TA;) and ↓ اخضبت, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
إِخْضَابٌ; (TA;) or ↓ اختضبت; and ↓ تخضّبت;<br>\
(A;) The earth, or land, exposed to view, (A,)<br>\
or produced, (K,) its herbage, (A, K,) and it<br>\
(the latter) became green. (TA.)<br>\

خَضْبٌ The colour of a tree, or of the spadix<br>\
of a palm-tree, when it becomes green: pl.<br>\
خُضُوبٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A plant fresh, or new, and<br>\
green in consequence of rain; as also ↓ خَضُوبٌ:<br>\
(K:) or watered by rain, and imparting a colour<br>\
to the ordure: (TA:) or the green colour that<br>\
appears in trees when they begin to put forth<br>\
their leaves: (K:) pl. خُضُوبٌ. (TA.)<br>\
خَضْبَةٌ A spadix of a palm-tree: خَصْبَةٌ, [q. v.,]<br>\
with the unpointed ص, is erroneously said to have<br>\
this signification. (TA.)<br>\
خُضَبَةٌ A woman who uses خِضَاب for herself<br>\
[i. e. for dyeing her hair or hands &amp;c.] much, or<br>\
often. (S, A, K.)<br>\
خِضَابٌ Hinnà (حِنَّآء), and the like: (Msb:)<br>\
or the thing with which one dyes, or tinges, his,<br>\
or her, hair &amp;c.; (S, K, TA;) such as حِنَّآء and<br>\
كَتَم and the like. (TA.)<br>\
خَضُوبٌ: see خَضْبٌ.<br>\
خَضِيبٌ Anything dyed, tinged, or changed<br>\
in colour; [generally, with hinnà;] as also<br>\
↓ مَخْضُوبٌ: the former is both masc. and fem.:<br>\
and its pl. is خُضُبٌ. (TA.) You say كَفٌّ خَضِيبٌ<br>\
(S, A, K) and ↓ خَاضِبٌ (TA voce ضَارِبٌ) [A hand<br>\
dyed with hinnà]: and بَنَانٌ خَضِيبٌ and ↓ مَخْضُوبٌ<br>\
(K) and ↓ مُخَضَّبٌ (S, A, K) [fingers, or fingers&#39;<br>\
ends, dyed with hinnà]; but the last of these has<br>\
an intensive signification. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,<br>\
(TA,) الكَفُّ الخَضِيبُ (assumed tropical:)  A certain star; (S, A,<br>\
K;) the star<br>\
β of Cassiopeia; (so in the Egyptian<br>\
almanacs;) [i. e.] the bright star of the constel-lation called ذَاتُ الكُرْسِىِّ; which star is [termed]<br>\
the extended right hand of الثُّرَيَّا [or the Pleiades;<br>\
corresponding to the star called الكَفُّ الجَذْمَآءُ].<br>\
(Kzw. [See أَجْذَمُ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اِمْرَأَةٌ خَضِيبٌ [A<br>\
woman having her hands, or feet, or hair, &amp;c.,<br>\
dyed with hinnà or the like]. (K.)<br>\
خَاضِبٌ A man dyeing, or who dyes, his hair<br>\
with hinnà. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also خَضِيبٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
(tropical:)  A male ostrich (S, A, K, &amp;c.) whose shanks<br>\
(A, K) and legs (A) have become red, (A, K,) or<br>\
green, [app. meaning of a dark, or an ashy, dustcolour,] or yellow, (A,) in consequence of his<br>\
lusting after the female, (A, K,) or in consequence<br>\
of his having eaten the [herbage termed] رَبِيع:<br>\
(A:) or the front edges of whose shanks have become red, (S, K,) or green, (K,) or yellow, in<br>\
consequence of his having eaten the [herbage<br>\
termed] ربيع: (S, K:) or whose beak and shanks<br>\
have become red from his having eaten the [herbage termed] ربيع: in the summer (الصَّيْف) he<br>\
becomes bald (يقرع), and his shanks become<br>\
white: (L:) or whose shanks have become green<br>\
by reason of lust in the [season termed] ربيع:<br>\
(ADk:) accord. to some, (TA,) it is applied<br>\
only to the male ostrich: (S, K:) but some explain it without this restriction; and Lth mentions<br>\
[the fem.] خَاضِبَةٌ as applied to an ostrich: [it is<br>\
said that] the skin of the neck, and that of the<br>\
breast, and that of the thighs, of the male ostrich,<br>\
but not his feathers, become intensely red when<br>\
he lusts after the female: or, as some say, خاضب<br>\
signifies an ostrich that has eaten green food:<br>\
(TA:) or the extremities of whose feathers are<br>\
dyed by [the eating of] blossoms, and the slender<br>\
parts of whose legs have become red by the same<br>\
cause: accord. to an Arab of the desert, supposed<br>\
to be Aboo-Kheyreh, in the [season termed]<br>\
ربيع, when it eats أَسَارِيع [app. meaning certain<br>\
worms so called], its legs and beak assume the<br>\
red hue of the عُصْفُر [or safflower]: (AHn, L:)<br>\
or خاضب is applied to a male ostrich the slender<br>\
parts of whose legs become red when the dates<br>\
begin to become red, and cease to be so when the<br>\
redness of the dates ceases: (AHn, K:) so that<br>\
it is not from eating اساريع, which, it is said, no<br>\
ostrich is known to eat: accord. to As, the cause<br>\
[of the redness above mentioned] is only the dye<br>\
of blossoms; but were it so, the bird would also<br>\
become yellow, and green, &amp;c., [and some assert<br>\
that it partially does, as has been shown above,]<br>\
accord. to the colours of the blossoms and herbs;<br>\
and the green colour would predominate: [but,<br>\
as the Arabs say, this requires consideration:]<br>\
whatever be the cause, the bird, it is said, is<br>\
termed خاضب on account of the redness that affects its shanks: and this word is [said to be] an<br>\
epithet used as a proper name of the bird: (AHn,<br>\
L:) but this is a mistake, unless it mean that,<br>\
because of its prevailing application, it is used in<br>\
the same manner as الحٰرِثُ and العَبَّاسُ, not that<br>\
it may be used [in a determinate sense] without<br>\
the article ال: (L:) the pl. is خَوَاضِبُ. (TA.)<br>\
It is also said to be applied as an epithet to Any<br>\
animal that eats خَضْب [q. v.]: (TA:) and particularly to [the species of bovine antelope called]<br>\
the wild bull (الثَّوْرُ الوَحْشِىُّ). (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [See also<br>\
a saying of Dukeyn cited voce رَاوُوقٌ.]<br>\
مِخْضَبٌ I. q. مِرْكَنٌ, (S, K,) or إِجَّانَةٌ: (A:)<br>\
or a vessel resembling that called إِجَّانَةٌ, in which<br>\
clothes are washed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَخَاضِبُ [is its pl.;<br>\
and also] signifies The rags of the خِضَاب [or<br>\
hudot;innà or the like]: (A:) [or] of the حيض [or<br>\
catamenia]. (TA.) [If these two significations<br>\
be correct, the latter is app. tropical: but حيض<br>\
may be a mistranscription for خضاب.]<br>\
