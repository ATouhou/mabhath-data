خَسَأَ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
خَسَاَ, (K,) inf. n. خَسْءٌ (S, K)<br>\
and خُسُوْءٌ, (K,) He drove away a dog: (S, K:)<br>\
he chid him. (Lth.)<br>\
-A2-  It is also intrans., (S,)<br>\
and signifies He (a dog) went away, to a distance; (S, * K;) [being driven away, or chidden;]<br>\
as also خَسِئَ, (K,) and ↓ انخسأ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] tropically, said to a man, اِخْسَأْ إِلَيْكَ,<br>\
meaning اِخْسَأْ عَنِّى (tropical:)  [Go thou away: or go thou<br>\
away from me]. (TA.) اِخْسَؤُوا فِيهَا وَ لَا تُكَلِّمُونِ,<br>\
in the Kur [xxiii. 110], is expressive of removal<br>\
to a distance with anger; [meaning (assumed tropical:)  Go ye away<br>\
into it, (i. e. the fire of Hell,) and speak not unto<br>\
Me.] (Zj.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence, (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became,<br>\
vile and despised and hated: so says Golius, as<br>\
on the authority of the KL; but this meaning is<br>\
not in my copy of that work: it agrees, however,<br>\
with a signification of the part. n. خَاسِئٌ, q. v.]<br>\
-A3-  Also, inf. n. خَسْءٌ and خُسُوْءٌ [as above], said<br>\
of the sight, (AZ, S, K,) (tropical:)  It was, or became,<br>\
dazzled, or confused, (AZ, S, TA,) and dim.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\

خَاسَؤُوا, (K,) inf. n. مُخَاسَأَةٌ, (S,) (tropical:)  They<br>\
threw stones, one at another; (S, K;) as also<br>\
↓ تخاسؤوا, (K,) or تخاسؤوا بِالحِجَارَةِ. (S.) And<br>\
كَانَتْ بَيْنَهُمْ مُخَاسَأَةٌ (tropical:)  [There was between them<br>\
a contending in throwing, or throwing of stones].<br>\
(S, TA.) [See also art. خسى.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And هُوَ يُخَاسِئُ<br>\
means يُقَامِرُ [He contends in a game of hazard].<br>\
(IB, TA in art. خسو.)<br>\

خَسِىْءٌ Bad wool. (O, K.)<br>\
خَاسِئٌ, applied to a dog, and to a swine, (K,)<br>\
and to a devil, (TA,) Driven away, repelled, and<br>\
not suffered to come near to men. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And [hence,] (assumed tropical:)  Contemptible, despicable, vile, or<br>\
abject. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Applied to the sight, (tropical:)  Dazzled,<br>\
or confused, (S, TA,) and dim. (TA.) So in the<br>\
words of the Kur [lxvii. 4], يَنْقَلِبُ إِلَيْكَ البَصَرُ<br>\
خَاسِئًا (tropical:)  [The sight will recoil to thee dazzled, or<br>\
confused, or dim]: (S, TA:) or the meaning here<br>\
is (assumed tropical:)  contemptible: or withdrawing far away: or<br>\
it is of the measure فَاعِلٌ in the sense of the<br>\
measure مَفْعُولٌ, [meaning repelled far away,]<br>\
like عِيشَةٍ رَاضِيَةٍ, in the Kur [lxix. 21 and ci. 5],<br>\
for مَرْضِيَّةٍ. (TA.)<br>\
