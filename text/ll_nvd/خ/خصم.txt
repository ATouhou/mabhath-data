خَصِمَ, aor.<br>\
خَصَمَ, [inf. n., app., خَصَمٌ,] He contended in an altercation, disputed, or litigated, in<br>\
a valid, or sound, manner. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 3:<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  and 8.<br>\
3<br>\
خاصمهُ, inf. n. مُخَاصَمَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
خِصَامٌ (S, Msb) and [quasi-inf. n.] خُصُومَةٌ, (K,)<br>\
the last said in the S to be a simple subst., (TA,)<br>\
He contended with him in an altercation, disputed with him, or litigated with him; (K, TA;)<br>\
i. q. نَازَعَهُ: (Mgh and Msb and K in art. نزع:)<br>\
accord. to El-Harállee, الخِصَامُ signifies the saying which the listener is made to hear, and which<br>\
is made to enter his ear-hole, such as may cause<br>\
him to refrain, or desist, from his assertion, and<br>\
his plea, or claim. (TA.) You say, خَاصَمْتُهُ<br>\
↓ فَخَصَمْتُهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *) aor. of the latter<br>\
أَخْصِمُهُ, with kesr, (S, K, *) or أَخْصُمُهُ, with<br>\
damm, (Mgh, Msb,) or not with damm, (S,) or<br>\
both these forms of the aor. are used, accord. to<br>\
AHei; the latter agreeable with analogy; (MF;)<br>\
the former anomalous; for the regular aor. of an unaugmented sound verb in a case of this kind is with<br>\
damm, (S, K,) as in the instance of عَالَمْتُهُ فَعَلَمْتُهُ,<br>\
aor. أَعْلُمُهُ; (S;) if it has not a faucial letter<br>\
(S, K) for its medial radical, (K,) in which case<br>\
it is with fet-h, as in the instance of فَاخَرْتُهُ<br>\
فَفَخَرْتُهُ, aor. أَفْخَرُهُ, (S, K,) accord. to the opinion<br>\
of Ks, but this is contr. to the opinion generally<br>\
held: (MF:) the inf. n. of خَصَمْتُهُ is خَصْمٌ:<br>\
(S, * TA:) and the meaning is, [I contended with<br>\
him in an altercation, or I disputed, or litigated,<br>\
with him, and] I overcame him in the altercation, &amp;c. (Mgh, Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  خاصمهُ also signifies<br>\
He put it in, or by, the خُصْم, i. e. edge, or side,<br>\
of the bed. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اخصمهُ He dictated to him his plea against<br>\
his adversary in an altercation or a dispute or<br>\
litigation, (JK, TA,) whereby he might overcome<br>\
the latter. (JK.)<br>\

تَخَاْصَمَ see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
8<br>\
اختصموا They contended in altercation, disputed, or litigated, one with another; (Msb,<br>\
TA;) i. q. ↓ تخاصموا; (S, K, TA;) both signifying as above. (TA.) He who reads يَخَصِّمُونَ<br>\
[in the Kur xxxvi. 49] means يَخْتَصِمُونَ; changing the ت into ص, and incorporating [it into the<br>\
other ص], and transferring its vowel to the خ:<br>\
some read يَخِصِّمُونَ, without transferring that<br>\
vowel; (S, K;) because a quiescent letter, when<br>\
it is made movent, is [regularly] made so with<br>\
kesr: (S:) AA slurred the vowel of the خ: the<br>\
pronunciation [يَخْصِّمُونَ] with two quiescent<br>\
letters together is incorrect: (S, K:) Hamzeh<br>\
read ↓ يَخْصِمُونَ, (S,) i. e., with the خ quiescent<br>\
and with kesr to the ص. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اِخْتَصَمَا إِلَيْهِ<br>\
They two applied to him for the decision of a<br>\
cause, each of them claiming the right. (TA in<br>\
art. قمط.) And إِلَيْهِ ↓ تُخُوصِمَ [An application<br>\
was made to him by litigants for the decision of a<br>\
cause]. (Mgh in art. دلو.)<br>\
-A2-  السَّيْفُ يَخْتَصِمُ جَفْنَهُ,<br>\
said by J to signify The sword cuts (lit. eats) its<br>\
scabbard, by reason of its sharpness, is a mistake;<br>\
the verb being correctly with ض, (K, * TA,)<br>\
dotted. (TA.)<br>\
خَصْمٌ An adversary in contention or altercation, in dispute, or in litigation; an antagonist;<br>\
a litigant: (JK, K, TA:) as also ↓ خَصِيمٌ: (JK,<br>\
S, K, TA:) the former is used alike as masc. and<br>\
fem. (S, Msb, K) and sing. (JK, S, Msb, K) and<br>\
dual (Msb, K) and pl.; (JK, S, Msb, K;) because<br>\
it is originally an inf. n.: (S, TA:) [see an ex.<br>\
of its use in a pl. sense in a verse cited voce<br>\
جَنَفٌ:] but it also has the dual form, خَصْمَانِ;<br>\
(S, Msb;) and the pl. خُصُومٌ (JK, S, Msb, K)<br>\
and خِصَامٌ (Msb) and perhaps أَخْصَامٌ, [which is<br>\
a pl. of pauc.,] or this may be pl. of خَصِمٌ: (TA:)<br>\
the pl. of ↓ خَصِيمٌ is خُصَمَآءُ (JK, S, K) and<br>\
خُصْمَانٌ. (K.)<br>\
خُصْمٌ The side (S, K) of anything; (S, TA;)<br>\
as, for instance, of a load such as is called عِدْل;<br>\
(S;) and of a bed; and the edge thereof: (TA:)<br>\
written by Aboo-Moosà with ض; but IAth says<br>\
that it is correctly with ص: (TA in art. خضم:)<br>\
a lateral part or portion (S, K) of anything:<br>\
(S:) a corner, (S, K,) as well as a side, (S,) of<br>\
an عِدْل, and of a receptacle, such as a خُرْج or<br>\
a جُوَالِق or an عَيْبَة: (S:) and the [anterior<br>\
lower] extremity of a [water-bag of the kind<br>\
termed] رَاوِيَة, that is opposite to the عَزْلَآء; (JK,<br>\
K, TA; [in the CK, الزّاوِيَةِ and الغَزْلاءِ are erroneously put for الرَّاوِيَةِ and العَزْلَآءِ;]) the upper<br>\
extremity [correctly extremities, at which are the<br>\
loops whereby it is suspended upon the side of<br>\
the camel,] being called the عصم [i. e. عُصْم, pl.<br>\
of عِصَامٌ]: (TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَخْصَامٌ and [of<br>\
mult.] خُصُومٌ: (K:) but some say that the أَخْصَام<br>\
of the [water-bag termed] مَزَادَة, and its خُصُوم,<br>\
are its corners: the خُصُوم of a cloud are its<br>\
sides: (TA:) and أَخْصَامُ العَيْنِ signifies the<br>\
part, or parts, of the eye upon which the edges<br>\
of the lids close together. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also A<br>\
gap, or an intervening space: it is said in the<br>\
TA that] الأَخْصَامُ [pl. of الخُصْمُ] signifies الفرج<br>\
[i. e. الفُرَجُ, pl. of الفُرْجَةُ: and it is added,] one<br>\
says, of an unsound, a corrupt, or a disordered,<br>\
affair, لَا يُسَّدُ مِنْهُ خُصْمٌ إِلَّا انْفَتَحَ خُصْمٌ آخَرُ (tropical:)  [A<br>\
gap of it will not be stopped up but another gap<br>\
will open]; occurring in a trad., meaning, the<br>\
state of affairs is disordered and distressing, and<br>\
not to be rectified and repaired. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [The<br>\
pl.] خُصُومٌ also signifies The mouths of valleys.<br>\
(JK, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And The lower parts, or stocks,<br>\
syn. أُصُولٌ, (JK, K,) of [trees of the kind called]<br>\
سَرَحَات [pl. of سَرْحَةٌ]; used in this sense by Et-<br>\
Tirimmáh. (JK.)<br>\
خَصِمٌ Vehement in altercation or dispute or<br>\
litigation; (S, K, * TA;) as also ↓ خَصُومٌ: (Ham<br>\
p. 628:) [or each signifies contentious, disputatious,<br>\
or litigious:] or the former, knowing, or skilled,<br>\
in altercation &amp;c., though not practising it:<br>\
(IB, TA:) or valid, or sound, therein; as also<br>\
↓ خَصِيمٌ: (Msb:) or this last signifies one who<br>\
contends with another in an altercation, disputes<br>\
with him, or litigates with him: (IB, TA:) the<br>\
pl. of the first is خَصِمُونَ, (K,) occurring in the<br>\
Kur xliii. 58; and perhaps أَخْصَامٌ, or this may<br>\
be a pl. of خَصْمٌ. (TA.)<br>\
خَصْمَةٌ A certain bead, or gem, or the like, used<br>\
by men [as an amulet], in the K, مِنْ حُرُوزِ الرِّجَالِ,<br>\
but correctly, as in the M, مِنْ خَزَرِ الرِّجَالِ, (TA,)<br>\
worn on the occasion of contending in an altercation, or disputing, or litigating, or on going<br>\
into the presence of the Sultán; (K, TA;) and<br>\
sometimes it is beneath the gem of the man&#39;s signetring, when it is small; and it may be in his<br>\
button; and sometimes they put it in the ذُؤَابَة<br>\
[or cord by which the hilt is occasionally attached<br>\
to the guard] of the sword: (TA:) also called<br>\
خَضْمَةٌ. (K and TA in art. خضم.)<br>\
خُصْمَةٌ and see خُصُومَةٌ.<br>\
خُصْمَانِيَّةٌ: see خُصُومَةٌ.<br>\
خَصُومٌ: see خَصِمٌ.<br>\
خَصِيمٌ: see خَصْمٌ, in two places; and خَصِمٌ.<br>\
خُصُومَةٌ Contention or altercation; disputation;<br>\
litigation; (K, TA;) a subst. from 3 (S, TA)<br>\
or 8 (JK, * TA) and 6, as also ↓ خُصْمَةٌ and<br>\
↓ خُصْمَانِيَّةٌ. (TA.) فَصْلُ الخُصُومَةِ: see art.<br>\
فصل. [See also an ex. voce حُكْمٌ.]<br>\
أُخْصُومٌ The loop of the [sack called] جُوَالِق,<br>\
(JK, TA,) and of the [load called] عِدْل; (TA;)<br>\
i. q. أُخْسُومٌ; (K;) but the latter is a dial. var.<br>\
of weak authority, and disapproved. (TA in art.<br>\
خسم.)<br>\
