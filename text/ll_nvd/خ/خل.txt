measure فَعَلَ, aor.<br>\
خَلِ3َ or<br>\

↓ خللّٰهُ has a similar, but intensive, signification.<br>\
(Msb) A poet says,<br>\
سَمِعْنَ بِمَوْتِهِ فَظَهَرْنَ نَوْحًا<br>\
قِيَامًا مَا يُخَلُّ لَهُنَّ عُودُ<br>\

upon خُلَّة. (S.)<br>\
-A4-  خَلَّ, (Lh, S, K,) [aor.<br>\
خَلُ3َ,]<br>\
inf. n. خَلٌّ, (TA,) is also syn. with خَصَّ [He<br>\
particularized, or specified]; (Lh, S, K;) contr.<br>\
of عَمَّ; (K;) and so ↓ خلّل: (JK, S, TA:) thus<br>\
in the phrase, عَمَّ فِى دُعَائِهِ وَخَلَّ (S, TA) and<br>\
وَخَلَّلَ (JK, S, TA) [He included, or comprehended, persons or things in common, or in<br>\

خلّل أَسْنَانَهُ, inf. n. تَخْلِيلٌ, [He picked his<br>\
teeth;] he extracted the remains of food between<br>\
his teeth with a خِلَال [or toothpick]; (Msb, K, *<br>\

or toes, (K,) in the ablution termed وُضُوْء; (S,<br>\

It (the former) is as though it were taken from<br>\
تَخَلَّلْتُ القَوْمَ meaning “I entered amid the<br>\
breaks, or interspaces, of the people. ” (Msb.)<br>\
Hence the trad., خَلِّلُوا أَصَابِعَكُمْ لَا تُخَلَّلَهَا نَارٌ قَلِيلٌ<br>\

(Msb,) or of expressed juice, (K,) it became<br>\
vinegar; (Mgh, Msb, K;) as also ↓ اختلّ; (Lth,<br>\
K;) but this is disallowed by Az; (TA;) and<br>\
↓ تخلّل; but this is of the language of the<br>\
lawyers; (Mgh;) or, said of نبيذ, this last signifies it was made into vinegar: (Msb:) or<br>\
خلّل, said of شراب, signifies it spoiled, (JK, T,)<br>\
and became vinegar. (T.)<br>\
-A4-  تَخْلِيلٌ also signifies The making vinegar; (S;) and so ↓ اِخْتِلَالٌ;<br>\

other things than بُسْر; as cucumbers, and cabbage, and بَاذَنْجَان [q. v.], and onions. (TA.)<br>\
[Accord. to modern usage, the verb signifies He<br>\
pickled.]<br>\

a true, or sincere, friend. (JK, S, * Mgh, K.)<br>\
لَا بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلَا خِلَالٌ, in the Kur [xiv. 36], is said<br>\
to mean [Wherein shall be no buying or selling]<br>\
nor mutual befriending: or [and no friends, or<br>\
true friends, for], as some say, خِلَالٌ is here pl.<br>\
of ↓ خُلَّةٌ, like as جِلَالٌ is pl. of جُلَّةٌ. (TA.)<br>\

أُخِلَّ and أُخِلَّ بِهِ: see 1, near the<br>\

instance, in belief, and in confession thereof,<br>\
and in works: (Ksh and Bd in ii. 2:) he left it,<br>\
neglected it, omitted it; or left it undone: (Har<br>\
p. 402:) or i. q. أَجْحَفَ بِهِ [app. as meaning he<br>\
was near to falling short of accomplishing it, or<br>\
of doing what was requisite in it; or was near<br>\
to being remiss in it]; namely, a thing. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
He failed of fulfilling his compact with him, or<br>\
his promise to him. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He became absent,<br>\
or he absented himself, from it; he left, abandoned, or quitted, it; namely, a place &amp;c. (K.)<br>\
You say, اخلّ بِمَرْكَزِهِ He (a man, S, or a horseman, Mgh) left, abandoned, or quitted, his station<br>\
(S, Mgh) which the commander had appointed<br>\
him. (Mgh.) And اخلّ بِهِمْ He became absent,<br>\
or he absented himself, from them. (JK.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
اخلّ الوَالِى بِالثُّغُورِ The prefect made the frontiers<br>\

him, to want, or be in need. (JK, S, K.) You<br>\
say, مَا أَخَلَّكَ إِلَى هٰذَا What has made thee, or<br>\

K.)<br>\
-A4-  اخلّ الأِبِلَ: see 1, near the end of the<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
-A5-  اخلّوا, (K,) inf. n. إِخْلَالٌ, (TA,)<br>\
Their camels pastured upon what is termed خُلَّة.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, اخلّ said of a man signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  أَخَذَ مِنْ قُبُلٍ [i. e. He took frontways]: opposed to أَحْمَضَ [and حَمَّضَ, q. v.], meaning<br>\
أَخَذَ مِنْ دُبُرٍ. (TA.)<br>\
-A6-  اخلّت النَّخْلَةُ The palmtree produced bad fruit. (A&#39; Obeyd, JK, S, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And The palm-tree produced dates such as<br>\
are termed خَلَال: [like أَبْلَحَت from بَلَحٌ:] thus<br>\
it bears two contr. significations. (K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تخلّل [primarily signifies It entered, or<br>\
penetrated, or passed through, the خِلَال, i. e.<br>\
interstices, &amp;c., of a thing]. You say, تَخَلَّلْتُ<br>\
القَوْمَ I entered amid the breaks, or interspaces,<br>\
of the people. (S, M, Msb, K. *) And تَخَلَّلُوا<br>\
الدِّيَارَ [They went through the midst of the houses].<br>\
(S in art. جوس.) And تخلّل الرَّمْلَ He passed<br>\
through the sands. (Az, TA.) And تخلّل القَلْبَ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [It penetrated the heart]; said of admonition.<br>\
(TA in art. بهم.) And تخلّل الاشَّىْءُ The thing<br>\
[i. e. anything] went, or passed, through. (JK, *<br>\
S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, It intervened; said of a time<br>\
&amp;c. And hence the phrase مِنْ غَيْرِ تَخَلُّلِ Without<br>\
interruption.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And تخلّل المَطَرُ The rain was<br>\
confined to a particular place, or to particular<br>\
places; was not general. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 1, in<br>\
two places, in the former half of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
تخلّل الرُّطَبَ He sought out the fresh ripe dates<br>\
in the interstices of the roots of the branches (M,<br>\
K) after the cutting off of the racemes of fruit.<br>\
(M.) And تخلّل النَّخْلَةَ He picked the dates<br>\
that were among the roots of the branches of<br>\
the palm-tree; as also تَكَرَّبَهَا. (AHn, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
For other significations, see 2, in four places.<br>\
6<br>\
تَخَالٌّ [said of several persons] The being<br>\
friendly, one with another. (KL.) [You say,<br>\
تَخَالُّوا They acted together, or associated, as<br>\
friends, or as true friends.]<br>\
8<br>\
اختلّ [primarily signifies] It had interstices, breaks, chinks, or the like. (MA. [See<br>\
خَلَلٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,] It was, or became,<br>\
shaky, loose, lax, uncompact, disordered, unsound,<br>\
corrupt, (Msb,) faulty, or defective, (KL, Msb,)<br>\
[and weak, or infirm, (see خَلَلٌ and مُخْتَلٌّ,)]<br>\
said of a thing or an affair; (KL;) it became<br>\
altered for the worse. (Msb.) [You say, اختلّ<br>\
مِزَاجُهُ His constitution, or temperament, became<br>\
in a corrupt or disordered state. And اختلّ alone<br>\
He was, or became, disordered in temper; (see<br>\
تَحَمَّضَ;) but this seems to be from the same<br>\
verb said of a camel; (see اختلّت الأِبِلُ, below;)<br>\
for the camel becomes disordered in his stomach<br>\
by pasturing long upon خُلَّة, without shifting to<br>\
حَمْض. And اختلّ عَقْلَهُ His mind, or intellect,<br>\
was, or became, unsound, or disordered.] And<br>\
اختلّ أَمْرُهُ [His affair, or state, was,  or became,<br>\
unsound, corrupt, or disordered]; (S, voce<br>\
اِضْطَرَبَ;) i. e. وَقَعَ فِيهِ الخَلَلُ. (JM.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He<br>\
was, or became, lean, meagre, or emaciated;<br>\
(KL;) and so اختلّ جِسْمُهُ. (S.) See 1, first<br>\
sentence. ―<br>\
-b4-  See also خَلَّ as syn. with أَخَلَّ or<br>\
أُخِلَّ &amp;c., near the beginning of the first paragraph. [Hence,] اختلّ إِلَيْهِ He wanted it, or<br>\
needed it; (S, Msb, K;) namely, a thing; (S,<br>\
Msb;) as also اليه ↓ أَخَلَّ: (TA:) whence the<br>\
saying of Ibn-Mes&#39;ood, عَلَيْكُمْ بِالعِلْمِ فَإِنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ<br>\
لَايَدْرِى مَتَى يُخْتَلُّ إِلَيْهِ [Keep ye to the pursuit<br>\
of knowledge, or science; for any one of you<br>\
knows not, or will not know, when it will be<br>\
wanted, or needed]; i. e., when men will want,<br>\
or need, that [knowledge] which he possesses.<br>\
(S.) You say also, اُخْتُلَّ إِلَى فُلَانٍ Such a one<br>\
was wanted, or needed. (JK.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 2, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
-A3-  اختلّهُ بِالرُّمْحِ, and بِالسَّهْمِ: and<br>\

of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  اختلّ also signifies He served<br>\
together. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اُخْتُلَّ said of herbage: see<br>\

the bone. (K.)<br>\

تَخَلْخَلَتْ She attired herself with the<br>\
خَلْخَال [or anklet, or pair of anklets]. (K.)<br>\

خَلٌّ a word of well-known meaning, (S, Msb.)<br>\
Vinegar; i. e. expressed juice of grapes (JK,<br>\
Mgh, K) and of dates (JK) &amp;c. (K) that has<br>\
become acid, or sour: (JK, * Mgh, K:) so called<br>\
because its sweet flavour has become altered for<br>\
the worse (اِخْتَلَّ): (Msb:) a genuine Arabic<br>\
word: (IDrd, K:) the best is that of wine: it is<br>\
composed of two constituents (K) of subtile<br>\
natures, (TA,) hot and cold, (K,) the cold<br>\
being predominant: (TA:) and is good for the<br>\
stomach; and for the gums, (K,) which it<br>\
strengthens, when one rinses the mouth with it;<br>\
(TA;) and for foul ulcers or sores; and for the<br>\
itch; and for the bite, or sting, of venomous<br>\
reptiles; and as an antidote for the eating of<br>\
opium; and for burns; and for toothache; and<br>\
its hot vapour is good for the dropsy, and for<br>\
difficulty of hearing, and for ringing in the ears:<br>\
(K: [various other properties &amp;c. are assigned to<br>\
it in the TA:]) ↓ خَلَّةٌ signifies somewhat (lit. a<br>\
portion) thereof; [being the n. un.:] (Aboo-Ziyád, K;) or it may be a dial. var. thereof, like<br>\
as خَمْرَةٌ is [said by some to be] of خَمْرٌ: (Aboo-Ziyád, TA:) see also خَلَّةٌ: the pl. is خُلُولٌ<br>\
[meaning sorts, or kinds, of vinegar]. (Msb.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., نِعْمَ الإِدَامُ الخَلُّ [Excellent,<br>\
or most excellent, is the seasoning, vinegar!].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] أُمُّ الخَلِّ [The mother of<br>\

JK, S,) or مَا لَهُ خَلٌّ وَلَا خَمْرٌ, (K,) or مَا عِنْدَ<br>\
فُلَانٍ خَلٌّ وَلَا خَمْرٌ, (S, in art. خمر,) Such a one,<br>\
or he, possesses neither good nor evil: (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
JK, S, K:) [or neither evil nor good: for] AA<br>\
says that some of the Arabs make الخَمْرُ to be<br>\
good, and الخَلُّ to be evil; [and thus the latter is<br>\
explained in one place, in this art., in the K;]<br>\
and some of them make الخمر to be evil, and<br>\
الخلّ to be good. (Har p. 153.)<br>\
-A2-  I. q. حَمْضٌ<br>\
[i. e. A kind of plants in which is saltness: or<br>\

such as has in it saltness [or sourness]: (TA:)<br>\
the [kind of plant, or tree, called] عَرْفَج; and<br>\
every tree that remains in winter: (JK:) accord.<br>\
to Lh, it is [applied to certain kinds] of trees &amp;c.:<br>\
accord. to IAar, peculiarly of trees: but accord.<br>\
to A&#39;Obeyd, [shrubs, i. e.] not including any great<br>\
trees: (TA:) and a certain thorny tree: also a<br>\

(AHn, TA:) the pl. is خُلَلٌ: (K:) one says<br>\

trees such as are called] عِضَاه, and sometimes not<br>\
containing such; and that خُلَّةٌ is also applied to<br>\
land in which are no trees nor any herbage:<br>\
(TA:) some say that خُلَّةٌ, as meaning the pasture, or herbage, which is the contrary of حَمْض,<br>\
has for a pl. خِلَالٌ, and then, from خِلَال is formed<br>\
the pl. أَخِلَّةٌ: and some say that this last means<br>\
herbage that is cut (وَاجْتُزّ ↓ اُخْتُلّ [in which the<br>\
latter verb seems to be an explicative adjunct to<br>\
the former]) while green. (Ham p. 662, q. v.)<br>\

the حَمْض is their fruit, (JK, T, Sudot;, TA,) or their<br>\
flesh-meat, (S, TA,) or their خَبِيص. (TA.) ―<br>\

Hence, by way of comparison, it is applied to<br>\
(tropical:)  Ease, or repose; freedom from trouble or inconvenience, and toil or fatigue; or tranquillity;<br>\
and ampleness of circumstances: and حَمْض, to<br>\

the outer side of the curved extremity of a bow:<br>\

from without, and is an ornament, or a decoration: (TA:) and any piece of skin that is<br>\
variegated, or embellished: (M, K:) the pl. is<br>\
خِلَلٌ (S, K, and Ham p. 330) and خِلَالٌ, and<br>\
pl. pl. أَخِلَّةٌ, (K,) i. e. pl. of خِلَالٌ. (TA.)<br>\

in the Kur xxiv. 43 and xxx. 47: (S, TA:) the latter may be [grammatically] a sing. [syn. with the<br>\
former], or it may be pl. of the former: (MF,<br>\
TA:) and الدَّارِ ↓ خِلَالُ signifies what is around<br>\
