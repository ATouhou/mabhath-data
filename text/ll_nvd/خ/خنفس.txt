خُنْفَسَآءُ (S, Msb, K) [in two copies of the S,<br>\
in which it is without the article, written without<br>\
tenween, but in the Msb and K it has the article<br>\
prefixed, and is therefore necessarily without tenween,] and خُنْفُسَآء, (Msb, TA,) which is more<br>\
common, (Msb,) [but this I doubt, for I have<br>\
found it nowhere else,] and ↓ خُنْفَسٌ (S, K) and<br>\
خُنْفُسٌ (TA) and خِنْفِسٌ, (K,) which last is of<br>\
the dial. of the people of El-Basrah, (TA,) and<br>\
خُنْفُسَةٌ and خُنْفُسَةٌ, (K,) [The black beetle: or a<br>\
certain species thereof:] a well-known creeping<br>\
thing; (Msb;) a certain insect, (S, K,) black,<br>\
(K,) of fetid odour, smaller than the جُعَل, found<br>\
in the bottoms of walls: (TA:) the first and<br>\
second of these words are both applied to the<br>\
male and the female: (Msb:) or خُنْفَسٌ is applied<br>\
to the male, (AA, Msb,) by some of the Arabs,<br>\
(Msb,) and is syn. with عُنْظَبٌ and حُنْظَبٌ, (AA,<br>\
TA,) and خُنْفُسٌ is not disallowable, being agree-<br>\
able with analogy: (Msb:) and خُنْفَسَاءَةٌ is applied to the female, [which, if correct, shows<br>\
خنفسآء to be with tenween,] and so is خُنْفَسَةٌ:<br>\
(S:) or خنفساءة, with ة, is not allowable; [and<br>\
if so, خنفسآء is without tenween;] (As, TA;)<br>\
and خنفسة is [not applied to the female, but]<br>\
used by the Benoo-Asad for خنفسآء, as though<br>\
they made the ة a substitute for the ا: (Msb:)<br>\
[and this seems to indicate that the ا is a fem. ا,<br>\
grammatically speaking, and that the word is<br>\
therefore without tenween:] the pl. is خَنَافِسُ.<br>\
(Msb.) One says, هُوَ أَلَحُّ مِنَ الخُنْفَسَآءِ [He is<br>\
more persevering than the black beetle]: because<br>\
it returns to thee as often as thou throwest it<br>\
away. (TA.)<br>\
[Accord. to the K, the ن in the words of this<br>\
art. is radical; but accord. to the S and Msb,<br>\
augmentative.]<br>\
