والخَبْتُ وَبِالضَّمِّ السَّذَابُ, we find وَالخَفْتُ بِالفَتْحِ<br>\
وَبِالضَّمِّ السَّذَابُ, meaning that حَفْتٌ and خُفْتٌ<br>\
signify the same as سَذَابٌ.])<br>\

TA,) which at one time inclines, and at another<br>\
time stands straight; accord. to A &#39;Obeyd, خافت<br>\
meaning what is fresh, or juicy, and soft, or<br>\
tender: or, accord. to one reading, to خَافِتَةُ الزَّرْعِ,<br>\
meaning fresh, or juicy, seed-produce, that is<br>\
soft, or tender, and weak; the ة being added in<br>\
خافته as though by زرع were meant سُنْبُلَة.<br>\
