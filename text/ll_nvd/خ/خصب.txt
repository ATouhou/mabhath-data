خصّب, inf. n. تَخْصِيبٌ, It rendered fruitful; it fecundated: so in the present day: see<br>\
an instance voce بَاقِلَّى.]<br>\
4<br>\
اخصب, (A, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِخْصَابٌ;<br>\
(TA;) [and some add خِصْبٌ, as another inf. n.;<br>\
but ISd holds this to be a simple subst.; (see 4<br>\
in art. ريف;)] and ↓ خَصِبَ, (A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
خَصَبَ;<br>\
(Msb, K;) and ↓ خَصَبَ, aor.<br>\
خَصِبَ, inf. n. خِصْبٌ;<br>\
(K;) It (a place) abounded, or became abundant,<br>\
with herbage [or with the produce of the earth],<br>\
and with the goods, conveniences, or comforts, of<br>\
life; (A, K;) [was, or became, fruitful;] had<br>\
increase; had plenty, or abundance; (Msb;)<br>\
[contr. of أَجْدَبَ and جَدِبَ or جَدَبَ and جَدُبَ:]<br>\
and اخصبت الأَرْضُ [the land, or earth, abounded,<br>\
or became abundant, with herbage &amp;c.]. (JK,<br>\
S.) إِخْصَابٌ and ↓ اِخْتِصَابٌ are both from الخِصْبُ<br>\
[but the precise meaning of the latter is not explained]. (Lth, JK, TA.) In the saying of the<br>\
rájiz,<br>\
لَقَدْ خَشِيتُ أَنْ أَرَى جَدِبَّا<br>\
فِى عَامِنَا ذَا بَعْدَ أَنْ أَخْصَبَّا<br>\
[Verily I feared to see drought, or barrenness,<br>\
or dearth, in this our year, after it had been<br>\
abundant in herbage &amp;c.], أَخْصَبَّا is put for أَخْصَبَا:<br>\
but accord. to one reading, it is ↓ اِخْصَبَّا, of the<br>\
measure اِفْعَلَّ, though this is generally employed<br>\
for colours; and the incipient ا is rendered disjunctive of necessity, for the sake of the metre.<br>\
(L. [Respecting جِدَبَّا, see جَدْبٌ.]) You say<br>\
also, اخصب جَنَابُ القَوْمِ, meaning The tract surrounding the people [became abundant with<br>\
herbage &amp;c.]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اخصبوا They attained,<br>\
obtained, had, or became in the condition of having, abundance of herbage [or of the produce of<br>\
the earth], and of the goods, conveniences, or<br>\
comforts, of life. (S, * K.) [They became in the<br>\
condition of persons whose food and milk, and the<br>\
pasture of whose land, were abundant. (See the<br>\
part. n., مُخْصِبٌ, below.)] And اخصبت الشَّاةُ<br>\
The ewe, or she-goat, obtained abundance of<br>\
herbage. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اخصب اللّٰهُ المَوْضِعِ God<br>\
caused the place to produce herbs and pasture.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
-A3-  اخصبت العِضَاهُ, mentioned as on the<br>\
authority of Lth, [and in the K,] is, accord. to<br>\
Az, a gross mistranscription, for اخصبت [q. v.].<br>\

أَخْصَابٌ, (S, K,) like بَلَدٌ سَبْسَبٌ and سَبَاسِبُ &amp;c.,<br>\

the earth], or with the goods, conveniences, or<br>\

And أَرْضٌ خَصِبٌ and ↓ خَصِيبَةٌ, (AHn, TA,) and<br>\
أَرْضُونَ خِصْبٌ [because خِصْبٌ is originally an<br>\
inf. n.] and خِصْبَةٌ and ↓ خَصْبَةٌ, which last word<br>\
is either an inf. n. used as an epithet, or a contraction of ↓ خَصِبَةٌ, (K,) A land, and lands,<br>\

in which the quality of a subst. is predominant,]<br>\
A palm-tree having much fruit: pl. خِصَابٌ (S,<br>\
K) and ↓ خَصْبٌ: (K, TA:) or خَصْبٌ [is properly a coll. gen. n., and] signifies palm-trees<br>\
[absolutely:] (K:) and خَصْبَةٌ signifies a palmtree of the kind called نَخْلَةُ الدَّقَلِ, in the dial. of<br>\
the people of El-Bahreyn, (Az, TA,) or of Nejd;<br>\
(TA;) and its pl. is خِصَابٌ. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is<br>\
said that ↓ خَصْبٌ signifies also The spadix of the<br>\
palm-tree: so in the K: and accord. to Lth,<br>\
خَصْبَةٌ signifies a single spadix of a palm-tree:<br>\
but [it is probably a mistranscription for خَضْبَةٌ,<br>\
with the pointed ض:] Az says that he who assigns to it this meaning errs. (TA.)<br>\
خَصِيبٌ; and its fem., with ة: see خِنْصبٌ, in<br>\
