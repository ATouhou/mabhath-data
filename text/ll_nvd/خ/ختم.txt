خَتَمَهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
خَتِمَ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. خَتْمٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and خِتَامٌ, (Lh,<br>\
K, TA,) with kesr, (TA,) [in the CK, erroneously, خَتَام,] i. q. طَبَعَهُ [He sealed, stamped,<br>\
imprinted, or impressed, it]: (Msb, K:) or he<br>\
put the خَاتَم [or signet] upon it: (Mgh:) namely,<br>\
a thing, (S, Mgh,) or a writing or book and the<br>\
like: and خَتَمَ عَلَيْهِ signifies the same [or he put<br>\
a seal, or the impression of a signet, upon it].<br>\
(Msb.) Accord. to Er-Rághib, خَتْمٌ and طَبْعٌ<br>\
signify The impressing a thing with the engraving<br>\
of the signet and stamp: and the former [as is<br>\
indicated, but not plainly expressed, as distinguished from the latter,] is tropically used,<br>\
sometimes, as meaning the securing oneself from<br>\
a thing, and protecting [oneself] from it; in consideration of protection by means of sealing upon<br>\
writings and doors: and sometimes as meaning<br>\
the producing an impression, or effect, upon a<br>\
thing from another thing; in consideration of the<br>\
impress produced [by the signet]: and sometimes<br>\
it is used as relating to (assumed tropical:)  the reaching the end [of<br>\
a thing]: (TA:) or the primary signification of<br>\
خَتْمٌ is the act of covering over [a thing]: (Az,<br>\
TA:) accord. to Zj, the proper meaning of خَتْمٌ<br>\
and طَبْعٌ is the covering over a thing, and securing<br>\
oneself from a thing&#39;s entering it: some say that<br>\
the former signifies the concealing a notification<br>\
of a thing, [as] by putting one&#39;s fingers over it, by<br>\
way of guarding oneself thereby. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, خَتْمُ الشَّهَادَةِ [The sealing of the testimony];<br>\
which is thus described by El-Hulwánee: the<br>\
witness, when he wrote his name upon a صَكّ<br>\
[q. v.], caused his written name to be beneath a<br>\
piece of lead, [i. e. covered it with a piece of lead,]<br>\
and put upon it the impress of his signet, in order<br>\
that there might be no falsification of it or substitution for it. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  As to خَتْمُ الأَعْنَاقِ [The<br>\
sealing of the necks], the case is related, in the<br>\
“Risáleh Yoosufeeyeh,” to have been this:<br>\
&#39;Omar sent Ibn-Honeyf to seal the عُلُوج [or unbelievers] of the Sawád; and he sealed five<br>\
hundred thousand of them, in classes; that is, he<br>\
marked them twelve dirhems, and twenty-four,<br>\
and forty-eight; tying a thong upon the neck of<br>\
each, and putting upon the knot a seal of lead.<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  خَتْمٌ also signifies The protecting what<br>\
is in a writing by marking [or stamping] a piece<br>\
of clay [upon it, or by means of a seal of any<br>\
kind]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And you say, of a man, خَتَمَ<br>\
عَلَيْكَ بَابَهُ [He sealed his door against thee];<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  he turned away from thee, avoided thee,<br>\
or shunned thee. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And خَتَمَ لَكَ بَابَهُ<br>\
[He sealed for thee his door]; meaning (tropical:)  he preferred thee to others. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  خَتَمَ عَلَى قَلْبِهِ<br>\
[which may be rendered He sealed his heart]<br>\
means (tropical:)  he made him to be such that he understood<br>\
not, and such that nothing proceeded from him;<br>\
or he made his heart, or mind, to be such that it<br>\
understood not, &amp;c. (K, TA.) خَتَمَ اللّٰهُ عَلَى<br>\
قُلُوبِهِمْ, in the Kur [ii. 6], is like the phrase in<br>\
the same [xvi. 110 and xlvii. 18] طَبَعَ اللّٰهُ عَلَى<br>\
قُلُوبِهِمْ: (TA:) it points to what God has made<br>\
to be usually the case when a man has ended in<br>\
believing what is false and in committing that<br>\
which is forbidden, so that he turns not his face to<br>\
the truth; this occasioning, as its result, his becoming inured to the approval of acts of disobedience, so that he is as though this habit were<br>\
impressed upon his heart: the assertion of ElJubbáee, that it means God hath put a seal upon<br>\
their hearts, as a sign, to the angels, of their<br>\
infidelity, is nought: (Er-Rághib, TA:) الخَتْمُ<br>\
is explained by IAar as meaning the preventing<br>\
of the heart from believing. (L in art. خدع.)<br>\
[See also طَبَعَ.] ―<br>\
-b8-  خَتَمَ الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. خَتْمٌ, also<br>\
signifies [as indicated above] (assumed tropical:)  He reached the<br>\
end of the thing. (K.) And الشَّىْءَ ↓ اِخْتَتَمْتُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [I ended, or finished, the thing,] contr. of<br>\
اِفْتَتَحْتُهُ. (S, TA.) You say, خَتَمَ القُرْآنَ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
reached the end of the Kur-án [in reciting it];<br>\
(S, Er-Rághib;) [he recited the whole of the<br>\
Kur-án;] he completed [the recital of] the Kur-<br>\
án: (Mgh:) [and] he retained in his memory the<br>\
last portion of the Kur-án; meaning he retained<br>\
the whole of it in his memory. (Msb.) It is said<br>\
of Suleymán El-Aamash, كَانَ يَقْرَأُ خَتْمًا, meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He used to recite the whole of the Kur-án; at<br>\
one time, according to the reading of Ibn-Mes&#39;ood;<br>\
at another time, from the edition of &#39;Othmán.<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b9-  You say also, خَتَمَ اللّٰهُ لَهُ بِخَيْرٍ (assumed tropical:)  [May<br>\
God make his end to be good]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b10-  خَتَمَ البَذْرَ<br>\

خَتِمَ, inf. n.<br>\
خَتْمٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  he watered the seed-produce, or<br>\
sown field, the first time; (JK, K, TA;) because,<br>\
when it is watered, it is finished (خُتِمَ) with the<br>\
رحا [app. رَحَا, which here seems to mean the<br>\
“roller,” as being likened to a mill-stone, though<br>\
I find no authority for this meaning]; (TA;) as<br>\
also خَتَمَ عَلَيْهِ: (K:) or خَتَمُوا عَلَى زُرُوعِهِمْ<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  they watered their sown fields while these<br>\
were as yet كِرَاب [app. meaning clear of vegetation]. (JK, TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  خَتَمَ النَّحْلُ (tropical:)  The bees<br>\
filled with honey the place in which they deposited<br>\
it: (JK, A, TA:) or خَتْمٌ signifies bees&#39; collecting<br>\
some thin wax, thinner than the wax of the comb,<br>\
and smearing with it the orifices of their خَلَايَا<br>\
[or hives]. (M, K, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
ختّمهُ, inf. n. تَخْتِيمٌ, He sealed it, stamped<br>\
it, &amp;c., much. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [In modern Arabic, He<br>\

تختّم, or تختّم خَاتَمًا, (accord. to different<br>\
copies of the S,) or تختّم بِخَاتَمٍ, (K, [agreeably<br>\

-b2-  And تختّم (tropical:)  He put on a turban:<br>\
(K, TA:) or تختّم بِعِمَامَتِهِ he put on his turban<br>\
in the manner of a نِقَاب [q. v.]; syn. تَنَقَّبَ بِهَا.<br>\
(Z, TA.) The subst. [signifying the act or mode,<br>\
of doing so] is ↓ تَخْتِمَةٌ [q. v. infrà]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
تختّم بِأَمْرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He concealed his affair, or case.<br>\
(Z, K.) ―<br>\

-b2-  Also A sealed piece of clay<br>\
[or wax]: like نَفَضٌ in the sense of مَنْفُوضٌ, and<br>\
قَبَضٌ in the sense of مَقْبُوضٌ: so in the saying of<br>\
El-Aashà,<br>\
وَ أَبْرَزَهَا وَ عَلَيْهَا خَتَمْ  وَ صَحْبَآءَ طَافَ يَهُودِيُّهَا<br>\
[And a jar of reddish-coloured wine, the Jew<br>\
-vender whereof came, and brought it out, with<br>\

also خِتَامٌ.]<br>\

present day: pl. خَتَمَاتٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  And also] vulgarly<br>\

ex. in a verse of Lebeed cited in art. دكن.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  [The hymen; as being the seal of virginity;<br>\
as also ↓ خَاتَمٌ.] You say, زُفَّتْ إِلَيْكَ بِخِتَامِهَا<br>\
(tropical:)  [She was conducted as a bride to thee with her<br>\
seal of virginity], and رَبِّهَا ↓ بِخَاتَمِ [with the seal<br>\
of her Lord]. (TA.) And [hence, app.,] سِيقَتْ<br>\
هَدِيَّتُهُمْ إِلَيْهِ بِخِتَامِهَا (tropical:)  [if it mean, as I suppose<br>\
it to do, Their present was sent to him with<br>\

part of a valley. (JK, TA.) (assumed tropical:)  The last of a<br>\

last of the prophets], in the Kur [xxxiii. 40];<br>\
accord. to one reading, ↓ خَاتُم, with damm to<br>\

to &#39;Alkameh and Mujáhid, its admixture shall<br>\
be musk: accord. to Ibn-Mes&#39;ood, its result shall<br>\
be the taste of musk: Fr says, ↓ خَاتَمٌ and ↓ خَاتِمٌ<br>\
and خِتَامٌ are nearly the same in meaning;<br>\
whence the reading of &#39;Alee, مِسْكٌ ↓ خَاتَمُهُ: and<br>\
the explanation is this; that when any one shall<br>\
drink thereof, he will find the last cup thereof<br>\
to have the odour of musk: Er-Rághib says<br>\
that the meaning is, the end, and the last draught,<br>\
i. e. what shall remain, thereof shall be in perfume [like] musk: and that the assertion that<br>\
it means it shall be sealed with musk is nought.<br>\
(TA.) [See also خَاتَمٌ and خَاتِمَةٌ.]<br>\

the CK and TA ↓ خَيْتَام) and ↓ خِتَامٌ (K and<br>\
TA but omitted in the CK) and ↓ خَتَمٌ (ISd,<br>\
IHsh, K) and ↓ خَتْمٌ (Ez-Zeyn El-&#39;Irákee, TA)<br>\
and ↓ خَيْتَمْ (Ibn-Málik, TA) and ↓ خَيْتُومٌ (EzZeyn El-&#39;Irákee, TA) and ↓ خَاتِيَامٌ (K) signify<br>\

generally a signet-ring; i. e.] a certain ornament<br>\
(حَلْىٌ, M, K) for the finger, (K,) app., at the<br>\
first, used for sealing, or stamping, therewith;<br>\
so that the word is of the same class as طَابَعٌ: afterwards, in consequence of frequency of usage,<br>\
applied to one not used for that purpose: (ISd,<br>\
TA:) or a ring having a فَصّ of a substance<br>\
different therefrom [set in it; i. e., having a<br>\
stone, or gem, set in it]: if without a فَصّ, it is<br>\

agent [i. e. the person sealing, or stamping]:<br>\
(JK, Az, Msb:) خَاتَمٌ, the thing that is put upon<br>\
the piece of clay [or wax, for the purpose of<br>\
sealing, or stamping]: (Az, Msb, K:) the pl.<br>\
[of خَاتَمٌ and خَاتِمٌ] is خَوَاتِمٌ (K) and [properly<br>\
of خَاتَامٌ] خَوَاتِيمُ: (S, in which the former pl.,<br>\
though more common, is not mentioned, and K:)<br>\
Sb says that those who use the latter pl. make<br>\
it to be pl. of a sing. of the measure فَاعَالٌ,<br>\
though it be not in their language; which shows<br>\
that he knew not خَاتَامٌ: the pl. of خَتْمٌ is خُتُومٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  خَاتَمٌ also signifies A seal, or stamp,<br>\
and a mark: so in a trad., in which it is said,<br>\
آمِينَ خَاتَمُ رَبِّ العَالَمِينَ عَلَى عِبَادِهِ المُؤْمِنِينَ, i. e.<br>\
[آمِينَ (or Amen) is] the seal, or stamp, and the<br>\
mark, [of the Lord of the beings of the whole world<br>\
upon his servants the believers,] which removes<br>\
from them accidents, and causes of mischief; for<br>\
the seal of the writing protects it, and precludes<br>\
those who look from [seeing] what is within<br>\
it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also خِتَامٌ, in seven places. [It<br>\
is nearly syn. with خِتَامٌ, as Fr says: and thus,]<br>\
it signifies also, (JK, K,) and so does ↓ خَاتِمَةٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) (assumed tropical:)  The end, or last part or portion, (JK,<br>\
S, K,) and result, or issue, (K,) of a thing (JK,<br>\
S, K) of any kind: (JK, K:) ↓ the latter [particularly] signifies (assumed tropical:)  the last part or portion (JK,<br>\
Msb) of a chapter of the Kur-án, (JK,) and of<br>\
the Kur-án itself: (Msb:) [and (assumed tropical:)  a concluding<br>\
chapter or section: an epilogue: and an appendix:] and ↓ مُخْتَتَمٌ signifies [in like manner]<br>\
the contr. of مُفْتَتَحٌ; as in the saying, التَّحْمِيدُ<br>\
مُفْتَتَحُ الْقُرْآنِ وَ الِاسْتِعَاذَةُ مُخْتَتَمُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [The declaration of the praises of God is the opening portion<br>\
of the Kur-án, and the prayer for the protection<br>\
of God is its closing portion]; (A, TA;) and it<br>\
is a chaste word, of frequent occurrence, though<br>\
the contr. has been asserted. (TA.) One says<br>\
also, الأَعْمَالُ بِخَوَاتِيمِهَا [Actions are characterized,<br>\

in which is the orifice, see حَلْقَتَا الرَّحِمِ and<br>\

here used as a dial. var. of طُبْى, i. e. the teat,<br>\
though I do not find it mentioned in its proper<br>\
art. in any lexicon; unless مِنْ طُبْيَتِهَا be a mistranscription for من طُبْيِهَا]: (K, TA:) so called<br>\
by way of comparison [to a signet or seal]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
