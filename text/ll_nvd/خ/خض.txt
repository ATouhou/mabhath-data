(S, O, K,) He agitated it; moved it about;<br>\
stirred it; shook it; namely, water, (S, O, K,)<br>\
and the like, (S, O,) and سَوِيق, and the like.<br>\
(O, K.) You say also, خَضْخَضْتُ دَلْوِى فِى المَآءِ<br>\
[I agitated, or dashed about, my bucket in the<br>\
water]. (O, TA.) Sakhr-el-Gheí El-Hudhalee<br>\
says, describing a water to which he had come for<br>\
drink,<br>\
فَخَضْخَضْتُ ضُفْنِىَ فِى جَمِّهِ<br>\
خِيَاضَ المُدَابِرِ قِدْحًا عَطُوفَا<br>\
(O, TA,) i. e. [And I dashed about my leathern<br>\
bucket in the main body thereof,] as he who is<br>\
overcome in the game of el-meysir introduces<br>\
among the other arrows a borrowed arrow [that<br>\
comes forth winning], in the luck of which he has<br>\
confidence. (TA in art. خوض.) This verb,<br>\
though mentioned here, is [said to be] from خَاضَ,<br>\
aor. يَخُوضُ; not from خَضَّ; therefore the poet<br>\
here uses خَيِاض for its inf. n. (O, TA.) You<br>\
also say, جَآءَهُ بِالخَنْجَرِ فَخَضْخَضَ بِهِ بَطْنَهُ [He<br>\
came to him with the dagger, and stirred about<br>\
with it his belly]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence a meaning<br>\
of the inf. n. explained in the first paragraph of<br>\
art. جلد.]<br>\
