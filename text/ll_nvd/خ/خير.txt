the choice, or option, given him]. (A.) ―<br>\

good is such a one!] phrases similar to مَاأَشَّرَهُ<br>\

said to Khalaf El-Ahmar, by an Arab of the<br>\
desert, in the presence of Aboo-Zeyd; whereupon<br>\
Khalaf said to him, “What a good word, if thou<br>\
hadst not defiled it by mentioning it to the [common] people! ” and Aboo-Zeyd returned to his<br>\
companions, and desired them, when Khalaf ElAhmar should come, to say, all together, these<br>\
words (ما خير اللبن للمريض), [in order to vex<br>\
him], and they did so. (TA.)<br>\

IAth to be the only instance of the kind except<br>\

and ↓ خَارَهُ; (K;) He chose, made choice of.<br>\
selected, elected, or preferred, him, or it. (S,<br>\
Msb, * K.) You say also, اِخْتَرْتُهُ الرِّجَالَ, and<br>\
مِنَ الرِّجَالِ, [I chose him from the men,] and<br>\
عَلَيْهِمْ, (K,) which last signifies in preference to<br>\
them. (TA.) It is said in the Kur [vii. 154],<br>\
وَاخْتَارَ مُوسَى قَوْمِهِ سَبْعِينَ رَجُلًا [And Moses chose<br>\
from his people seventy men]. (TA.) وَلَقَدِ<br>\
اخْتَرْنَاهُمْ عَلَى عِلْمٍ, in the Kur [xliv. 31, Verily<br>\
we have chosen them with knowledge], may be<br>\
indicative of God&#39;s producing good, or of his<br>\
preferring them before others. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استخار He sought, desired, or asked for,<br>\
خِيرَة (S, Msb, K) or خِيَرَة (as in some copies of<br>\
the K) [i. e. the blessing, prospering, or favour,<br>\
of God; &amp;c.]. [And it is trans.; for] one says,<br>\
اِسْتَخِرِ اللّٰهَ يَخِرْ لَكَ [Desire thou, or ask thou for,<br>\
the blessing, prospering, or favour, of God; &amp;c.;<br>\

asked, of God, the better of the two things, [or<br>\
rather the better in it, meaning a case, or an<br>\
affair,] and He chose it for me. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also 8.<br>\
خَيْرٌ [Good, moral or physical; anything that<br>\
is good, real or ideal, and actual or potential;<br>\
and, being originally an inf. n., used as sing and<br>\
pl.;] a thing that all desire; such as intelligence,<br>\
for instance, and equity; (Er-Rághib, and so in<br>\
some copies of the K;) [or goodness;] and excellence; and what is profitable or useful; benefit;<br>\
(Er-Rághib;) contr. of شَرٌّ: (S, A, Msb:) pl.<br>\
خُيُورٌ, (Msb, K,) and also, accord. to the Msb,<br>\
↓ خِيَارٌ: (TA:) [but this latter seems to be properly pl. only of خَيْرٌ used as an epithet (see<br>\
below) and as a noun denoting the comparative<br>\
and superlative degrees: it may however be used<br>\
as an epithet in which the quality of a subst. is<br>\
predominant:] خير is of two kinds: namely,<br>\
absolute خير, which is what is desired in all circumstances and by every person: and what is<br>\
خير [or good] to one and شرّ [or evil] to another;<br>\
as, for instance, (Er-Rághib,) wealth, or property: (Zj, L in art. شد, Er-Rághib, K:) it<br>\
has this last signification, namely wealth, or property, in the Kur, ii. 176 (S, TA) and ii. 274 and<br>\
xxiv. 33 and xli. 49: or in the first and second of<br>\
these instances it is thus called to imply the meaning of wealth, or property, that has been collected in a praiseworthy manner, or it means<br>\
much wealth or property; and this is its meaning in the first of the instances mentioned above,<br>\
agreeably with a trad. of &#39;Alee; and also in the<br>\
Kur, c. 8: (TA:) [being used as a pl. (as well<br>\
as a sing.), it may be also rendered good things:]<br>\
and it is also used by the Arabs to signify horses;<br>\
(K, * TA;) and has this meaning in the Kur,<br>\
xxxviii. 31: (TA:) [it is often best rendered<br>\
good fortune; prosperity; welfare; wellbeing;<br>\
weal; happiness; or a good state or condition:<br>\
and sometimes bounty, or beneficence.] رَجُلٌ قَلِيلُ<br>\
الخَيْرِ means [A man possessing little, or no, good;<br>\
possessing few, or no, good things; or poor: and<br>\
in whom is little, or no, good or goodness; or<br>\
niggardly: and also] a man who does little good:<br>\
(TA in art. عص:) or [who does no good;] who<br>\
is not near to doing good; denoting the nonexistence of good in him. (Msb in art. قل.)<br>\
[Thus it sometimes means the same as رَجُلٌ لَا<br>\
خَيْرَ فِيهِ A man in whom is no good or goodness;<br>\
devoid of goodness; worthless.] And قِلَّةُ خَيْرٍ<br>\
means Poverty: and also niggardliness. (A and<br>\
TA in art. جحد.) هُوَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الخَيْرِ وَالخِيرِ is<br>\
explained voce خِيرٌ. عَلَىيَدَىِ الخَيْرِ وَاليُمْنِ<br>\
[May it be with the aid of good fortune and prosperity] is a prayer used with respect to a marriage. (A &#39;Obeyd, TA.) And إِنَّكَ مَا وَخَيْرًا means<br>\
مَعَ خَيْرٍ, i. e., Mayest thou meet with, or attain,<br>\
good. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  خَيْرٌ in the phrase فُلَانٌ خَيْرٌ resembles an epithet [like ↓ خَيِّرٌ, and signifies<br>\
Good; or possessing good]; (Akh, S;) therefore<br>\
the fem. is خَيْرَةٌ, of which the pl. is خَيْرَاتٌ, (Akh,<br>\
S, Msb, *) as occurring in the Kur, lv. 70; and<br>\
they do not [there] mean by it [the comparative<br>\
or superlative signification of the measure] أَفْعَلُ:<br>\
(Akh, S:) you say ↓ رَجُلٌ خَيِّرٌ, (S, A, Msb,)<br>\
meaning [A good man; or] a man possessing خَيْر<br>\
[or good]; (Msb;) and رَجُلٌ خَيْرٌ: (S:) and in<br>\
like manner, ↓ اِمْرَأَةٌ خَيِّرَةٌ and خَيْرَةٌ, (S, Msb,)<br>\
meaning [A good woman; or] a woman excellent<br>\
in beauty and disposition: (Msb:) or خَيْرٌ and<br>\
↓ خَيِّرٌ signify possessing much خَيْر [or good], (K,)<br>\
applied to a man; (TA;) and in the same sense<br>\
you say ↓ رَجُلٌ خَيْرَى, and ↓ خُورَى, and ↓ خِيَرى:<br>\
and the fem. of the first is خَيْرَةٌ; and of the<br>\
second, ↓ خَيِّرَةٌ: (K:) and the pl. [of pauc.] (of<br>\
the first, TA) is أَخْيَارٌ, and [of mult.] خِيَارٌ: (A,<br>\
Msb, K:) you say also خِيَارُ المَالِ, meaning The<br>\
excellent of the camels or the like: (Msb, K:) and<br>\
in like manner you say of men &amp;c.: (TA:) [see<br>\
also below:] and the fem. is خَيْرَةٌ, of which the<br>\
pl. is خَيْرَاتٌ: (Msb:) خِيَارٌ is contr. of أَشْرَارٌ, (S,<br>\
Mgh,) [thus] used as an epithet: (Mgh:) and<br>\
↓ خَيْرَةٌ [used as a subst.] signifies anything excellent; and the pl. thereof in this sense, خَيْرَاتٌ,<br>\
occurs in the Kur, ix. 89: (S:) or خَيْرٌ, (K,) or<br>\
the fem. خَيْرَةٌ, (Lth,) or each, (K.) signifies excellent in beauty: (Lth, K:) and ↓ خَيِّرٌ and خَيِّرَةٌ<br>\
signify excellent in righteousness (Lth, K) and<br>\
religion: (K:) or there is no difference in the<br>\
opinion of the lexicologists [in general] between<br>\
خَيْرَةٌ and ↓ خَيِّرَةٌ: (Az:) accord. to Zj, خَيْرَاتٌ and<br>\
↓ خَيِّرَاتٌ, both occurring in different readings of<br>\
the Kur, lv. 70, signify good in dispositions:<br>\
accord. to Khálid Ibn-Jembeh, خَيْرَةٌ, applied to a<br>\
woman, signifies generous in race, exalted in<br>\
rank or quality or reputation, goodly in face,<br>\
good in disposition, possessing much wealth, who,<br>\
if she bring forth, brings forth a generous child:<br>\
(TA:) [↓ خِيَارٌ is also applied as an epithet to a<br>\
sing. subst., either masc. or fem.:] you say جَمَلٌ<br>\
خِيَارٌ and نَاقَةٌ خِيَارٌ, meaning A he-camel [that is<br>\
excellent or] excellent and brisk and so a she-camel. (TA.) See also مُخْتَارٌ, in three places.<br>\
In the saying لَعَمَرُ أَبِيكَ الخَيْرُ, the word خَيْر is<br>\
in the nom. case as an epithet of عَمْر; [so that<br>\
the phrase lit. means By the good life of thy<br>\
father;] but properly it should be لَعَمْرُ أَبِيكَ<br>\
الخَيْرِ [By the life of thy good father]: and the<br>\
like is said with شَرّ. (TA.) [See also art. عمر.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  خَيْرٌ is also used to denote superiority: one<br>\
says, هٰذَا خَيْرٌ مِنْ هٰذَا This is better than this:<br>\
and in the dial. of the Benoo-&#39;Ámir, ↓ هٰذَا أَخْيَرُ<br>\
مِنْ هٰذَا, with أ, and in like manner, أَشَّرُ; but<br>\
the rest of the Arabs drop the أ in each case:<br>\
(Msb:) you say, مِنْكَ ↓ هُوَ أَخْيَرُ [He is better<br>\
than thou], and in like manner, أَشَّرُ مِنْكَ; and<br>\
هُوَ خَيْرٌ مِنْكَ, and in like manner, شَرٌّ مِنْكَ; and,<br>\
[using the dim. form of خَيْرٌ,] مِنْكَ ↓ خُيَيْرٌ, and in<br>\
like manner, شُرَيْرٌ مِنْكَ. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA.) You<br>\
also say, when you mean to express the signification of superiority, فُلَانَةٌ خَيْرُ النَّاسِ [Such a<br>\
woman is the best of mankind]; but not خَيْرَةُ:<br>\
[see, however, what will be found cited hereafter<br>\
from the K,] and فُلَانٌ خَيْرُ النَّاسِ [Such a man is<br>\
the best of mankind]; but not ↓ أَخْيَرُ [unless in<br>\
the dial. of the Benoo-&#39;Ámir]: and [it is said<br>\
that] خَيْرُ when thus used does not assume the<br>\
dual form nor the pl., because it has the signification of [the measure] أَفْعَلُ: for though a poet<br>\
uses the dual form, he uses it as a contraction of<br>\
the dual of خَيِّرٌ, like مَيْتٌ and مَيِّتٌ, and هَيْنٌ<br>\
and هَيِّنٌ: (S:) [but. this remark in the S is incorrect: for both خَيْر and ↓ أَخْيَر, when used in<br>\
such phrases as those to which J here refers,<br>\
have pl. forms of frequent occurrence, and of<br>\
which examples will be found below; and, as is<br>\
said by I &#39;Ak (p. 239), and by many other grammarians, you may say, الزَّيْدَانِ أَفْضَلَا القَوْمِ, and<br>\
الزَّيْدُونَ أَفْضَلُو القَوْمِ and أَفَاضِلُ القَوْمِ, and also<br>\
هِنْدُ فُضْلَىالنِّسَآءِ, &amp;c.; and such concordance is<br>\
found in the Kur, vi. 123; and is even said by<br>\
many to be more chaste than the mode prescribed<br>\
by J:] it is said in the K, that you say, ↓ هُوَ أَخْيَرُ<br>\
مِنْكَ, like خَيْرُ; and when you mean the signification of superiority, you say فُلَانٌ خَيْرَةٌ النَّاسِ,<br>\
with ة, and فُلَانَةُ خَيْرُهُمْ, without ة: but [SM says,]<br>\
I know not how this is; for in the S is said what<br>\
is different from this, and in like manner by Z in<br>\
several places in the Ksh; and what is most<br>\
strange is, that the author of the K quotes in the<br>\
B the passage of J [from the S], and adopts the<br>\
opinion of the leading authorities [as given in the<br>\
S]: (TA:) or you say, فُلَانَةُ الخَيْرَةُ مِنَ المَرْأَتَيْنِ<br>\
[Such a woman is the better of the two women]:<br>\
and هِىَ الخَيْرَةُ, and ↓ الخِيرَةُ, [so in the TA, but<br>\
in the CK الخِيَرَةُ,] and ↓ الخِيرَى, and ↓ الخُورَى,<br>\
[the last being fem. of أَخْيَرُ, originally خُيْرَى,<br>\
and so, app., the last but one, She is the better, or<br>\
best:] (K:) and [using the dim. form of خَيْرٌ]<br>\
you say, أَهْلِهِ ↓ هُوَ خُيَيْرُ [He is the best of his<br>\
family]: (Ibn-Buzurj, TA:) one says also, to<br>\
one coming from a journey, خَيْرَ مَا رُدَّ فِى أَهْلٍ<br>\
وَمَالٍ, meaning May God make that with which<br>\
thou comest [back] to be the best of what is<br>\
brought back by the absent with family and property; (As, Meyd, TA;) or, as some relate it,<br>\
خَيْرُ, i. e. رَدُّكَ خَيْرُ رَدٍّ [may thy bringing back be<br>\
the best bringing back]; and فى is used in the<br>\
sense of مَعَ: (Meyd:) [أَخْيَارٌ is pl. of pauc.,<br>\
and خِيَارٌ pl. of mult., and so app. is خِيرَانٌ, of<br>\
خَيْرٌ thus used; and ↓ أَخَايِرُ is pl. of أَخْيَرُ, and so<br>\
is أَخْيَرُونَ applied to rational beings: in the TA,<br>\
أَخَايِرُ is said to be a pl. pl. of أَخْيَرُ, and so خِيرَانٌ;<br>\
but this is app. a mistake, probably of transcription:] you say رَجُلٌ مِنْ خِيَارِ النَّاسِ and أَخْيَارِهِمْ<br>\
and ↓ أَخَايِرِهِمْ [A man of the best of mankind]:<br>\
(A, TA:) and لَكَ خِيَارُ هٰذِهِ الإِبِلِ, and ↓ خِيرَتُهَا,<br>\
