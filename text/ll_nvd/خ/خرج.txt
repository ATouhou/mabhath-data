to most of the lawyers, (TA,) The revenue derived<br>\
from the slave is the property of the purchaser<br>\
because of the responsibility which he has borne<br>\
for him: (A, * Mgh, * K, TA:) for one purchases<br>\
a slave, and imposes upon him the task of producing a revenue for a time, and then may discover in him a fault which the seller had concealed;<br>\
wherefore he has a right to return him and to<br>\
receive back the price; but the revenue which he<br>\
had required the slave to produce is his lawful<br>\
property, because he had been responsible for<br>\
him; and if he had perished, part of his property<br>\
had perished: (K, * TA:) in a similar manner<br>\
IAth explains it, as relating to a male or female<br>\
slave or to other property. (TA.) ―<br>\

the players holds a thing in his hand and says to<br>\
the others, Elicit ye (أَخْرِجُوا) what is in my<br>\
hand: in the T, ↓ خراج and خريج are explained<br>\
by the word مُخَارَجَةٌ [meaning micare digitis;<br>\
