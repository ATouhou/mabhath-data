خَفَضَهُ, [aor.<br>\
خَفِضَ,] inf. n. خَفْضٌ, He lowered<br>\
it; depressed it; namely, a thing; contr. of رَفَعَهُ.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He (God) abased him; (S, Msb;) namely,<br>\
an unbeliever. (Msb.) You say, اَللّٰهُ يَخْفِضُ مَنْ<br>\
يَشَآءُ وَيْرفَعُ (assumed tropical:)  God abaseth whom He will, and exalteth.. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  خَفَضَ جَنَاحَهُ He (a bird) [lowered or] relaxed his wing, and contracted it to<br>\

his flying. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And the same phrase, (tropical:)  He<br>\
made himself gentle, easy to deal with, compliant,<br>\
or obsequious. (TA.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[xv. 88], وَاخْفِضْ خَنَآحَكَ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ (tropical:)  And make<br>\
thyself gentle, &amp;c., to the believers: (Jel, TA:)<br>\
or be thou condescending to the believers, and<br>\
treat them with gentleness. (Bd.) And again, in<br>\
the same [xvii. 25], (TA,) وَاخْفِضْ لَهُمَا جَنَاحَ<br>\
الذُّلِّ مِنَ الرَّحْمَةِ (tropical:)  And humble, or abase, thou<br>\
thyself to them both, from compassion: (Bd,<br>\
K, TA:) or make thyself submissively gentle to<br>\
them both, from compassion: (Bd, * Jel:) or<br>\
there is a transposition in the sentence, and the<br>\
meaning is واخفض لهما جناح الرحمة من الذلّ<br>\
[and make thyself compassionately gentle to them<br>\
both, from submissiveness]. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  إِنَّ اللّٰهَ<br>\
يَخْفِضُ القِسْطَ وَيَرْفَعُهُ, in a trad., means Verily<br>\
God, at one time, bringeth down to the ground<br>\
the just, or equitable; and, at another time, exalteth him: (ISh:) or maketh ample [the means<br>\
of subsistence &amp;c.] to whom He will, and maketh<br>\
scanty to whom He will: (Sgh, K:) or maketh<br>\
little the portion of the means of subsistence which<br>\
is the share of any created being, and maketh it<br>\
much. (TA in art. قسط, q. v.). خَفْضُ العَدْلِ<br>\
وَرَفْعُهُ is also explained as signifying The just&#39;s being<br>\
overcome by the unjust, when men act corruptly,<br>\
and the just&#39;s overcoming the unjust, when they repent, and act righteously. (TA.) [See also art. رفع.]<br>\

make me go a gentle pace, and another to make<br>\
me go a vehement pace, until I came unto you:<br>\
for خَفَضَ as relating to pace is probably not only<br>\
intrans., as it will be seen to be below, but also<br>\
trans., like its contr. رَفَعَ: or it may mean one<br>\
land ceased not to make me go down, and another<br>\
to make me go up, &amp;c.; though its being tropical<br>\
if having this meaning may be doubted]. (A,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\

voice; (Msb;) [contr. of رَفَعَهُ, as is indicated in<br>\
the A.] ―<br>\
-b8-  [In most of the above-mentioned<br>\
senses, ↓ خَفَّضَ is nearly; if not exactly, syn. with<br>\
خَفَضَ.] ―<br>\
-b9-  خَفَضَ الحَرْفَ فِى الإِعْرَابِ (assumed tropical:)  He made<br>\
the [final] letter to have kesreh, in inflection.<br>\
(Msb.) خَفْضٌ is syn. with جَرٌّ [q. v.] (S, K) in<br>\
the inflection of words: (K:) these two terms,<br>\
in the inflection of words, are like كَسْرٌ in the<br>\
non-inflection, in the conventional language of<br>\
the grammarians. (S.)<br>\

remained, stayed, or abode, in the place. (K.)<br>\

فَالْزَمِى الخُصَّ وَاخْفِضِى تَبْيَضِضِّى<br>\
[Verily the like of me, and verily the like of thee,<br>\
are different: therefore keep thou to the booth<br>\

become fair]: the last word is for تَبْيَضِّى; a ض<br>\
being added. (S.) ―<br>\

خَتَنْتُ الغُلَامَ, (S,) or, خُتِنَ الغُلَامُ: (A, K:) the<br>\
former verb applies only to a girl: (Msb, K:) or<br>\
you say sometimes, خفَضَ الصَّبِىَّ, aor.<br>\
خَفِضَ, inf. n.<br>\
خَفْضٌ, meaning he circumcised the boy. (TA.)<br>\

if thou take up thine abode in it, a family for a<br>\
