خَاطَ, (Msb, TA,) first pers. خِطْتُ, (S,)<br>\
aor. يَخِيطُ, (Msb,) inf. n. خِيَاطَةٌ, (S, TA,) or this<br>\
is a simple subst., (Msb, TK,) and the inf. n. is<br>\
خَيْطٌ, (TK,) which is said in the K to be syn.<br>\
with خِيَاطَةٌ, but this last is a mistake for خِيَاطٌ as<br>\
signifying “thread,” (TA,) or “a thread,” (AZ,<br>\
TA,) though خِيَاطٌ is also syn. with خِيَاطَةٌ, (TA,)<br>\
He sewed, sewed together, or sewed up, a garment,<br>\
or piece of cloth; (S, Msb, TA;) as also ↓ خيّطهُ,<br>\
inf. n. تَخْيِيطٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] خَاطَ بَعِيرًا<br>\
بِبَعِيرٍ (tropical:)  He coupled a camel with a camel [by<br>\
tying the end of the halter of one to the tail of<br>\
the other]. (TA.) ―<br>\

passed by him, or it, [or to, or towards, him or it,]<br>\
once: or ↓ خاط خَيْطَةً he passed along quickly:<br>\
(K, * TA:) and so ↓ اختاط and اِخْتَطَى. (K.)<br>\
It is said by Kr to be formed by transposition<br>\
from الخَطْوُ: but this is a mistake; for, were it<br>\
so, they would have said, خاط خَوْطَةً, not خَيْطَةً.<br>\
(ISd.) Accord. to Lth, وَاحِدَةً ↓ خاط خَيْطَةً<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  He made his journey [or a journey]<br>\
without interruption. (TA.) In the A it is said<br>\
that ↓ خاط فُلَانٌ خَيْطَةً means (tropical:)  Such a one journeyed on, not pausing for anything: and in like<br>\
manner, خاط إِلَى مَقْصِدِهِ (tropical:)  [He journeyed on, not<br>\
pausing for anything, to his place, or object, of<br>\
aim]. (TA.)<br>\

manner, فِى لِحْيَتِهِ in his beard. (TA.) Bedr<br>\
Ibn—&#39; Ámir El—Hudhalee says,<br>\
أَقْسَمْتُ لَا أَنْسَى مَنِيحَةَ وَاحِدٍ<br>\
حَتَّى تُخَيِّطَ بِالبَيَاضِ قُرُونِى<br>\
(S, TA) [I swear that I will not forget the loan<br>\
(here meaning the قَصِيدَة, Skr) of one (meaning<br>\
Abu—l—&#39;Iyál [with whom he was carrying on a<br>\
controversy], Skr)] until the sides of my head<br>\
become streaked with whiteness: (TA:) but some<br>\
read تُخَيَّطَ; and Ibn—Habeeb says that خَيَّطَ الشَّيْبُ<br>\
الرَّأْسَ signifies (assumed tropical:)  Whiteness of the hair, or hoariness, became conjoined and continuous upon the<br>\
head, as though one part thereof were sewed to<br>\
another: (IB, TA:) some read ↓ تَخَيَّطَ; and<br>\

meaning (assumed tropical:)  His head became streaked, or marked<br>\
as with threads, by whiteness of the hair, or<br>\
hoariness: [the best reading seems to be تَخَيَّطَ,<br>\
for تَتَتخَيَّطَ:] and some read تَوَخَّطَ [for تَتَوَخَّطَ,<br>\
from تَوَخَّطَ as having the meaning here assigned<br>\
to تَخَيَّطَ]. (TA.)<br>\

خَاطٌ: see خَيَّاطٌ.<br>\
خَيْطٌ Thread, or string; or a thread or string;<br>\
syn. سِلْكٌ; (S, K;) the thing with which one<br>\
sews; (Msb;) [often used as a coll. gen. n.;<br>\
n. un. with ة;] and ↓ خِيَاطٌ [likewise] signifies<br>\
the thing with which a garment, or piece of cloth,<br>\
is sewed; as also ↓ مِخْيَطٌ; besides having another<br>\
signification, common to it with the last, namely<br>\
“a needle; ” (K;) the pl. of خَيْطٌ is أَخْيَاطٌ [a pl.<br>\
of pauc.] (IB, K) and خُيُوطٌ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
خُيُوطَةٌ [both pls. of mult.]. (S, K.) It is said in<br>\
a trad., وَالمِخْيَطَ ↓ أَدُّوا الخِيَاطَ, meaning [Bring<br>\
ye] the خَيْط and the needle. (TA.) And you<br>\
say, ↓ أَعْطِنِى خِيَاطًا and نِصَاحًا, i. e. [Give thou to<br>\
me] a single خَيْط. (AZ, TA.) [أَعْطِنَى خِيَاطًا<br>\
وَنِصَاحًا may, however, mean Give thou to me a<br>\
needle and thread.] ―<br>\
-b2-  خَيْطُ الرَّقَبَةِ (assumed tropical:)  The نُخَاع [or<br>\
spinal cord] of the neck. (S, K) You say,<br>\
جَاحَشَ فُلَانٌ عَنْ خَيْطِ رَقَبَتِهِ, meaning (tropical:)  Such a<br>\
one defended his blood. (S, O, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  الخَيْطُ<br>\
الأَبْيَضُ and الخَيْطُ الأَسْوَدُ, mentioned in the Kur<br>\
ii. 183, mean (assumed tropical:)  The true dawn, and the false<br>\
dawn: (Msb:) or the whiteness of the dawn, and<br>\
the blackness of night; (K, TA;) likened to a<br>\
thread because of its thinness: (TA:) or the<br>\
whiteness of day, and the blackness of night:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, Nh:) or the dawn that extends sideways, and the dawn that rises high, or, as some<br>\
say, the blackness of night: (S:) or what appears<br>\
of the true dawn, which is the مُسْتَطِير, and what<br>\
extends with it of the darkness of night, which is<br>\
the dawn termed the مُسْتَطِيل: (Mgh:) or what<br>\
first appears of the dawn spreading sideways in<br>\
the horizon, and what extends with it of the darkness of the last part of the night: (Bd:) or the<br>\
dawn that rises high, filling the horizon, and the<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  The night and the day. (L in art. وسد.) تَبَيَّنَ<br>\
الخَيْطُ مِنَ الخَيْطِ means (tropical:)  [The night became distinct from the day: or] what is termed الخَيْطُ<br>\
الأَبْيَضُ became distinct from what is termed<br>\
الخَيْطُ الأَسْوَدُ. (TA.) And خَيْطٌ مِنَ الصُّبْحِ is<br>\
also said to signify (assumed tropical:)  A tint of the dawn. (TA.)<br>\
[See بَرِيمُ الصُّبْحِ in art. برم.] ―<br>\
-b4-  خَيْطُ بَاطِلٍ<br>\
(tropical:)  What is called لُعَابُ الشَّمْسِ and مُخَاطُ الشَّيْطَانِ,<br>\
(S, TA,) which last is explained by Z and IB as<br>\
meaning what comes forth from the mouth of the<br>\
spider: (TA: [the author of which says that,<br>\
accord. to this explanation, this term differs from<br>\
لعاب الشمس: but in so saying he seems to be in<br>\
error: both evidently signify gossamer:]) it was<br>\
applied as a surname, or nickname, to Marwán<br>\
Ibn-El-Hakam; because he was tall, and loose,<br>\
or uncompact, in frame: (S:) or it signifies the<br>\
air; syn. الهَوَآءُ [perhaps a mistranscription for<br>\
الهَبَآءُ, occurring in another explanation hereafter]:<br>\
(K:) or light entering from an aperture in a<br>\
wall [into a dark place] (Th, K:) or خَيْطُ البَاطِلِ<br>\
signifies the scattered هَبَآء [or atoms that are seen in<br>\
the rays of the sun] entering from an aperture<br>\
in a wall [into a dark place] when the sun is hot:<br>\
and one says, فُلَانٌ أَدَقُّ مِنْ خَيْطِ البَاطِلِ (tropical:)  [Such a<br>\
one is less in estimation than the scattered atoms<br>\
that are seen in the rays of the sun]; a prov.,<br>\
applied to him who is in an abject state; thus<br>\
related, on the authority of Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà,<br>\
by Az and others; but by Sgh, erroneously,<br>\
أَرَقُّ مِنْ خَيْطِ بَاطِلٍ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also what next<br>\
follows, in two places.<br>\
خِيطٌ (As, IDrd, S, K) and ↓ خَيْطٌ (IDrd, Msb,<br>\
K) and ↓ خَيْطَى (S, K) (assumed tropical:)  A collection, or flock,<br>\
of ostriches, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) and a swarm of<br>\
locusts, (K,) and a ↓ خَيْط is sometimes of [wild]<br>\
bulls or cows: (L, TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَخْيَاطٌ (IB)<br>\
and [of mult.] خِيطَانٌ: (K:) ↓ which last, as<br>\
also ↓ خَيْطَانٌ, signifies likewise a company of<br>\
men. (TA.) [خِيطٌ may perhaps be originally<br>\
خُيْطٌ, pl. of خَيْطَآءُ, q. v.]<br>\
خَيَطٌ (tropical:)  Length of the neck of an ostrich, (S, TA,)<br>\
and of the [bones, such as are termed] قَصَب<br>\
thereof: or, as some say, a constant mixture of<br>\
blackness with whiteness therein: or their being in<br>\
an uninterrupted line, like an extended خَيْط [or<br>\
thread]. (TA.)<br>\
خَيْطَةٌ [n. un. of خَيْطٌ, q. v. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,] in the dial.<br>\
of Hudheyl, (S,) A wooden peg or stoke, (Skr, S,<br>\
K,) which is fixed in a mountain, in order that<br>\
one may let himself down [by means of a rope<br>\
attached thereto] over against the place where<br>\
[wild] honey is deposited [to gather it]. (Skr.)<br>\
Aboo-Dhu-eyb says, (S, TA,) describing the gathere of honey, (TA,)<br>\
تَدَلَّى عَلَيْهَا بَيْنَ سِبٍّ وَخَيْطَةٍ<br>\
بِجَرْدَآءَ مِثْلِ الوَكْفِ يَكْبُو غُرَابُهَا<br>\
(S, TA,) i. e. He let himself down [over against<br>\
it, meaning the place of the honey, partly] by<br>\
means of a rope (for so سِبّ signifies) and [partly<br>\
by means of] a wooden peg or stake [to which the<br>\
rope was attached, fixed] in a rock smooth like<br>\
the [leather termed] وَكْف, i. q. نِطَع, [the crow<br>\
of which rock would fall prone upon its face for<br>\
want of something therein to which to cling:]<br>\
(TA:) or (in the K “ and ”) خيطة signifies a<br>\
rope; (As, Az, K, TA;) [and if so, سِبّ here<br>\
means “ a wooden peg,” which is a signification<br>\
assigned to it in the K in art. سب:] or, accord.<br>\
to AA, a slender rope (S, L, TA) made [of the<br>\
bark] of the tree called سَلَب: (L, TA:) and<br>\
(accord. to some, TA) a string which is with the<br>\
gatherer of honey, (K, TA,) and with which he<br>\
pulls the rope [app. when he has detached himself<br>\
from the latter to gather the honey], it being<br>\
tied to him: (TA:) or a [tunic of the kind called]<br>\
دُرَّاعَة, [of leather,] which he wears. (Ibn-Habeeb,<br>\
K, TA. [In the CK, دُرّاعَةٍ is erroneously put for<br>\
دُرَّاعَةٌ.])<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, in four places. One says<br>\
also, مَاآتِيكَ إِلَّا الخَيْطَةَ (assumed tropical:)  I do not come to thee<br>\
save sometime. (TA.)<br>\
خَيْطَى: see خِيطٌ.<br>\
خَيْطَآءُ (tropical:) A she-ostrich long in the neck. (S, K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
خَيْطَانٌ and خِيطَانٌ: see خِيطٌ.<br>\
خِيَاطٌ A needle; as also ↓ مِخْيَطٌ. (S, Msb, * K.)<br>\
Hence the saying in the Kur [vii. 38], حَتَّى يَلِجَ<br>\
الحَبَلُ فِى سَمِّ الخِيَاطِ [Until the camel enter into<br>\
the eye of the needle]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also خَيْطٌ, in<br>\
three places. ―<br>\
-b3-  And see مَخِيطٌ.<br>\
خِيَاطَةٌ The art of sewing. (Msb, TA.) [See<br>\
also 1.]<br>\
خَيَّاطٌ A seamster; one whose occupation is that<br>\
of sewing; (Msb, K;) as also ↓ خَائِطٌ (K) and<br>\
↓ خَاطٌ. (Sgh, K. [in the CK خَاطٌّ.]) [In the<br>\
present day, its predominant application is to A<br>\
tailor.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  One who passes along quickly.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
خَائِطٌ: see خَيَّاطٌ.<br>\
مَخِيطٌ and ↓ مَخْيُوطٌ A garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth, sewed: (S, Msb, K:) the ى in the former<br>\
is the و of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, changed into ى<br>\
because of its being quiescent and the preceding<br>\
letter&#39;s being with kesr; the letter preceding it<br>\
being made movent because it and the و are<br>\
quiescent after the ى has fallen out; [for by<br>\
dropping the ى it becomes changed from مَخْيُوطٌ<br>\
to مَخْوْطٌ;] and it is made movent with kesr [and<br>\
thus changed from مَخْوْطٌ to مَخِوْطٌ, which necessarily becomes مَخِيطٌ,] in order to its being<br>\
known that the letter which has dropped out is<br>\
ى: some say that the ى in مَخِيطٌ is the radical,<br>\
and that the letter thrown out is the و of the<br>\
measure مَفْعُولٌ, in order that the word with و<br>\
[for its medial radical] may be known from that<br>\
with ى; [so that it is changed from مَخْيُوطٌ to<br>\
مَخْيُطٌ, and then to مَخْيْطٌ, and then to مَخِيطٌ;]<br>\
but the former saying is the right, because the و<br>\
is a formative augment, and it is not proper that<br>\
such should be thrown out. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, the<br>\
former, (assumed tropical:)  The whole of the exterior of the belly.<br>\
(ISh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:) A place of passage; (O, L, TA;)<br>\
a meaning erroneously assigned in the K to ↓ خِيَاطٌ<br>\
and ↓ مَخْيَطٌ: (TA:) and particularly, (tropical:)  of a serpent; (TA;) the place of creeping along of a<br>\
serpent. (K, TA.)<br>\
