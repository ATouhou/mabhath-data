خَطَّ, aor.<br>\
خَطُ3َ, inf. n. خَطٌّ, He made [a line,<br>\
or lines, or] a mark, عَلَى الأَرْضِ, upon the ground.<br>\
(Msb.) You say, خَطَّ الزَّاجِرُ فِى الأَرْضِ, aor. and<br>\
inf. n. as above, The diviner made a line, or a<br>\
mark, or lines, or marks, upon the ground, and<br>\
then divined. (TA.) And الزَّاجِرُ يَخُطُّ بِإِصْبَعِهِ فِى<br>\
الرَّمْلِ وَيَزْجُرُ [The diviner makes lines, or marks,<br>\
with his finger upon the sand, and divines]. (S.)<br>\
Th says, on the authority of IAar, that عِلْمُ الخَطِّ<br>\
is عِلْمُ الرَّمْلِ [or geomancy]: I &#39;Ab says that it is<br>\
an ancient science, which men have relinquished:<br>\
but Lth says that it is practised to the present<br>\
time; [to which I may add, that it has not even<br>\
now ceased; being still practised on sand and the<br>\
like, and also on paper;] and they have conventional terms which they employ in it, and they<br>\
elicit thereby the secret thoughts &amp;c., and often<br>\
hit upon the right therein: the diviner comes to<br>\
a piece of soft ground, and he has a boy, with<br>\
whom is a style; and the master makes many<br>\
lines, or marks, in haste, that they may not be<br>\
counted; then he returns, and obliterates leisurely<br>\
lines, or marks, two by two; and if there remain<br>\
two lines, or marks, they are a sign of success,<br>\
and of the attainment of the thing wanted: while<br>\
he obliterates, his boy says, for the sake of auguring well, اِبْنَىْ عِيَانْ أَسْرِعَا البَيَانْ [O two sons of<br>\
&#39;Iyán (meaning two lines or marks), hasten ye<br>\
the manifestation]: I &#39;Ab says that when he has<br>\
obliterated the lines, or marks, and one remains,<br>\
it is the sign of disappointment: and AZ and<br>\
Lth relate the like of this. (TA.) It is said in a<br>\
trad. of Mo&#39;áwiyeh Ibn-El-Hakam Es-Sulamee,<br>\
traced up by him to its author, كَانَ نَبِىٌّ مِنَ<br>\
الأَنْبِيَآءِ يَخُطُّ فَمَنْ خَطَّهُ عَلِمَ مِثْلَ عِلْمِهِ [A<br>\
prophet of the prophets used to practise geomancy; and he who matches his geomancy knows<br>\
the like of his knowledge]. (TA.) You say also,<br>\
when a man is meditating upon his affair, and<br>\
considering what may be its issue, or result, فُلَانٌ<br>\
يَخُطُّ فِى الأَرْضِ (tropical:)  [Such a one makes lines, or<br>\
marks, upon the ground]. (TA.) [See also<br>\
نَكَتَ: and see St. John&#39;s Gospel, ch. viii. verses<br>\
6 and 8.] And خَطَّ بِرِجْلِهِ الأَرْضَ means (tropical:)  He<br>\
walked, or went along. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S, Msb,)<br>\
aor. as above, (Msb,) and so the inf. n., (Msb,<br>\
K,) He wrote (S, Msb, K) a writing, or book,<br>\
(Msb,) or a thing, (TA,) with the reed prepared<br>\
for that purpose, (S, K,) or with some other<br>\
thing; (K, TA;) [and so ↓ خطّط, for] تَخْطِيطٌ is<br>\
syn. with تَسْطِيرٌ, or, as in the T, like تسطير;<br>\
whence the saying, خُطِّطَتْ عَلَيْهِ ذُنُوبُهُ His sins<br>\
were written [or registered] against him. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  خَطَّ الخِطَّةَ, and خَطَّهَا لِنَفْسِهِ: see 8; for the<br>\
latter, in two places. ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence,] خَطَّ عَلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
prohibited it; or took it for himself; relating to<br>\
anything. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  خُطُّ وَحْهُهُ: or خَطَّ: see 8.<br>\

and his waist]. (TA.) And خَطَّهُ بِالسَّيْفِ نِصْفَيْنِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [He clave him, or it, in halves with the sword].<br>\
(TA.) And جَارَاهُ فَمَا خَطَّ غُبَارَهُ (tropical:)  He contended<br>\
with him in running, and did not cleave his dust.<br>\
(JK, S, * A, L.) ―<br>\
-b8-  خَطَّ اللّٰهُ نَوْءَهَا [God made its<br>\
(a land&#39;s) rain-giving star or asterism (see نَوْءٌ)<br>\
to pass it over: or may God make &amp;c.]: from<br>\
خَطِيطَةٌ signifying “ a land not rained upon between two lands that have been rained upon: ”<br>\
(S, TA: *) it was said by I&#39; Ab [in a tropical<br>\
sense, by way of imprecation, with reference to a<br>\
woman], when he was asked respecting a man<br>\
who had put the affair of his wife in her own<br>\
hand and she had in consequence divorced him<br>\
by a triple sentence: (S:) accord. to one relation,<br>\
it is خَطَّأَ; the meaning being “ may he make its<br>\
rain to miss it: ” (S, TA:) and accord. to another,<br>\
↓ خَطَّى, originally خَطَّطَ, like تَقَضَّى البَازِى: the<br>\
former, or first, is the weaker, or weakest, in<br>\
authority, of these relations. (TA. [See also 2 in<br>\
art. خطأ.])<br>\
2<br>\
خطّط, inf. n. تَخْطِيطٌ, [He marked with<br>\
lines, streaks, or stripes. Also] He wove a piece<br>\

(TA:) and he alighted and took up his abode in<br>\
the خِطَّة, none having done so before him; as<br>\
also لِنَفْسِهِ ↓ خَطَّهَا. (K.) [And hence, اختطّ signifies also He founded a town or the like.] ―<br>\

boy&#39;s, or young man&#39;s, beard grew forth; (S, L,<br>\

to different copies.)<br>\
خَطٌّ A line, streak, or stripe; in, or upon, a<br>\
thing: (K:) pl. خُطُوطٌ (S, K) and أَخْطَاطٌ; (K;)<br>\
the latter, [a pl. of pauc.,] used by El-&#39;Ajjáj:<br>\

above, being] a subst. form [the inf. n.] الخَطُّ,<br>\
like as نُقْطَةٌ is from النَّقْطُ: (S, K: *) you say,<br>\
↓ عَلَى ظَهْرِ الحِمَارِ خُطَّتَانِ Upon the back of the<br>\
ass are two lines, or streaks, differing in colour<br>\
from the rest of the body. (TA.) ―<br>\

said in a trad., of Keyleh, أَيُلَامُ ابْنُ هٰذِهِ أَنْ يَفْصِلَ<br>\
الخُطَّةَ وَيَنْتَصِرَ مِنْ وَرَآءِ الحَجَزَةِ [Is the son of this<br>\

absence of the wrongdoers who would prevent his<br>\
obtaining his right; or, of those who defend men,<br>\
one from another, and decide between them<br>\
justly?]: i. e., when a dubious event, to the encountering of which he does not find the right<br>\
way, befalls him, that he should not care for it,<br>\
but decide it so as to settle it and extricate himself<br>\
from it. (S, TA.) [See also حَاجِزٌ.] Also, in a<br>\
trad. respecting El-Hodeybiyeh, لَايَسْألُونِى خُطَّةً<br>\

[They shall not ask of me a matter wherein they<br>\
honour the sacred things of God, (exalted be He,)<br>\
but I will grant it to them]. (TA.) And in the<br>\
same, قَدْ عَرَضَ عَلَيْكُمْ خُطَّةَ رُشْدٍ فَاقْبَلُوهَا He hath<br>\
proposed to you a case of evident rectitude; therefore do ye accept it. (TA.) And Taäbbatasharrà says,<br>\
هُمَا خَطَّتَا إِمَّا إِسَارٌ وَمِنَّةٌ<br>\
وَإِمَّا دَمٌ وَالقَتْلُ بِالحُرِّ أَجْدَرُ<br>\

-b5-  An object of want which one has determined to accomplish: as in the saying, جَآءَ<br>\
وَفِى رَأْسِهِ خُطَّةٌ He came having in his mind [lit.<br>\
his head] an object of want &amp;c. : [but see the last<br>\
sentence in this paragraph:] the vulgar say<br>\
خُطْبَةٌ: (S, L:) the former is the word used by<br>\
the Arabs: (L:) the latter, however, occurs in<br>\
the “ Nawádir ” of AZ; therefore the attribution<br>\
of it to the vulgar demands consideration. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  Boldness to undertake affairs. (K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Ignorance. (K.) You say, فِى رَأْسِهِ خُطَّةٌ In his<br>\

and it has another meaning explained above.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
خِطَّةٌ A piece of ground, or land, which a man<br>\
takes to himself, and upon which he makes a<br>\
mark, in order to its being known that he has<br>\
chosen it to build there a house; whence the<br>\
خِطَط of El-Koofeh and of El-Basrah: (S:) or a<br>\
piece of ground, and a house, which a man takes<br>\
to himself, and upon which he makes a mark, in<br>\
land not possessed, that he may have it for himself exclusively, and build there; this being<br>\
done when the Sultán gives permission to a<br>\
number of the Muslims to found houses in a particular place, and to make their abodes there, as<br>\
they did in El-Koofeh and El-Basrah: (L:) or<br>\
a place which is taken and marked for building<br>\
houses, or for habitation, or the like: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) or, as is said in the Bári&#39;, a piece of<br>\
ground, or land, which a man takes to himself,<br>\
and upon which he makes a mark, it not having<br>\
belonged to any one before him; as also ↓ خِطٌّ;<br>\
(Msb;) which latter is explained by IDrd as<br>\
signifying a place which one takes to himself,<br>\
and marks, from other places: (IB, L:) or both<br>\
signify a piece of land in which one alights and<br>\
takes up his abode, none having done so before<br>\
him: (K:) the pl. of the former is حِطَزٌ. (S,<br>\
Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] فُلَانٌ بَيِّنٌ خِطَطِ المَكَارِمِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Such a one exhibits in himself the marks of<br>\
generous, or honourable, qualities]. (TA.)<br>\

two lands that have been rained upon: (S, K:)<br>\
or land of which part has been rained upon, (K,<br>\
TA,) and part has not: (TA:) or land not<br>\
rained upon surrounded by land that has been<br>\
rained upon; (ISh;) as also ↓ the latter word:<br>\
(AHn:) pl. of the former, خَطَائِطُ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence<br>\
the saying of a certain Arab, to his son, اِلْزَمْ<br>\
خَطِيطَةَ الذُّلِّ مَخَافَةَ مَا هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُ (tropical:)  [Keep thou<br>\
to the condition of abasement in fear of what is<br>\
more grievous than it]. (IAar, M.) ―<br>\

رِمَاحٌ خَطِّيَّةٌ Spears of El-Khatt; so called<br>\
from الخَطُّ, a place in El-Yemámeh, (S, Msb,)<br>\
also called خَطُّ هَجَرٍ, (S,) because they are brought<br>\
thither (S, Msb) from India, (S,) and straightened<br>\
in that place, (S, Msb, *) which is a coast for<br>\
ships; not that the canes grow there: (Msb:) or<br>\
they are so called from الخَطُّ which is the station<br>\
for ships in El-Bahreyn, because they are sold<br>\
there; not that it is the place of their growth:<br>\
this place is also called الخِطُّ: (K:) but this<br>\
demands consideration; for it is said [in the &#39;Eyn,<br>\
i. e.] by Lth, (TA,) or by Kh, (Msb,) that when<br>\
you convert the rel. n. into a subst., you say<br>\
↓ خِطِيَّةٌ, (Msb, TA,) with kesr to the خ, (Msb,)<br>\
without رماح, like as you say, ثِيَابٌ قِبْطِيَّةٌ, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) with kesr, (Msb,) but when you convert<br>\
the rel. n. into a subst., you say, قُبْطِيَّةٌ, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) with damm, to distinguish the subst. from<br>\
the rel. n., without ثياب: (Msb:) a single spear<br>\
of this kind is called رُمْحٌ خَطِّىٌّ: (TA:) AHn<br>\
says that الخَطِّىُّ signifies the spears; and that it<br>\
is a rel. n. used in the manner of a proper name;<br>\
being a rel. n. from الخَطُّ, which is خَطُّ البَحْرَيْنِ,<br>\
where ships moor when they come from India.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
خِطِّيَّةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
أَخَطُّ (assumed tropical:)  Delicate in beauties. (IAar.) [See<br>\
also مُخَطَّطٌ.]<br>\
مَخَطٌّ [A place marked with a line or lines,<br>\
with a streak or streaks, or with a stripe or<br>\
stripes]. (TA in art. طر.)<br>\

makes lines or marks or the like: (S:) or the<br>\
wooden instrument with which the weaver makes<br>\
lines or marks or the like, in, or upon, a piece of<br>\

مُخَطَّطٌ A [garment of the kind called] كِسَآء,<br>\

appeared upon the sides of his face, forming lines];<br>\
