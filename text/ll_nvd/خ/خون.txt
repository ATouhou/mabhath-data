خَانَهُ, (S, K,) aor. يَخُونُهُ, (S,) inf. n. خِيَانَةٌ<br>\
and خَوْنٌ and مَخَانَةٌ (S, K) and خَانَةٌ (K) and<br>\
خَائِنَةٌ, of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ, like لَاغِيَةٌ &amp;c.; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓ اختانهُ; (S, K;) He was unfaithful, or he<br>\
acted unfaithfully, to the confidence, or trust,<br>\
that he reposed in him; (K;) [he was treache<br>\
rous, perfidious, or unfaithful, to him; or he<br>\
acted treacherously, perfidiously, or unfaithfully,<br>\
towards him;] فِى كَذَا [in such a thing]: (S:)<br>\
خِيَانَةٌ is the contr. of أَمَانَةٌ; and does not relate<br>\
only to property, but also to other things: (Mgh:)<br>\
or the neglecting, or failing in, أَمَانَةٌ [which is<br>\
trustiness, or faithfulness]: (El-Harállee, TA:)<br>\
or i. q. نِفَاقٌ, except that خيانة regards a compact<br>\
or covenant or the like, and trustiness, or faith<br>\
fulness, and نفاق regards religion; so that the<br>\
former is the acting contrary to what is right, by<br>\
breaking a compact or covenant or the like: (Er<br>\
Rághib, TA:) but [it is said that] the primary<br>\
signification of خَوْنٌ is the making to suffer loss,<br>\
or diminution; because the خَائِن makes the<br>\
مَخُون to suffer loss, or diminution, of something.<br>\
(TA.) Hence, in the Kur [ii. 183], كُنْتُمْ<br>\
أَنْفُسَكُمْ ↓ تَخْتَانُونَ [lit. Ye used to act unfaith<br>\
fully to yourselves] means ye used to act un<br>\
faithfully, one to another: (S, * TA:) or ye used<br>\
to act wrongfully to yourselves: اِخْتِيَانٌ has a<br>\
more intensive signification than خِيَانَةٌ. (Bd.)<br>\
One says also, خان العَهْدَ He broke the compact<br>\
or covenant or the like: whence, تَقُولُ النِّعْمَةُ<br>\
كُفِرْتُ وَلَمْ أُشْكَرْ وَتَقُولُ الأَمَانَةُ خُنْتُ وَلَمْ أُحْفَظْ<br>\
[The benefit says, I have been disacknowledged,<br>\
and have not been requited with thankfulness;<br>\
and the trust says, I have been betrayed, and<br>\
have not been faithfully kept]: the verb [خُنْتُ]<br>\
being here of the measure فُعِلْتُ, a verb of which<br>\
the agent is not named. (Mgh.) And خَانَهُ العَهْدَ,<br>\
(Msb, K,) and فِى العَهْدِ, (Msb,) and خانهُ الأَمَانَةَ,<br>\
(Msb, K,) aor. as above, inf. n. خَوْنٌ and خِيَانَةٌ<br>\
and مَخَانَةٌ, (Msb,) [He was unfaithful to him in<br>\
respect of the compact or covenant or the like,<br>\
and the trust.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] خان سَيْفُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [His<br>\
sword was unfaithful;] i. e., failed of taking ef<br>\
fect upon the thing struck with it. (TA.) A cer<br>\
tain person, being asked respecting the sword,<br>\
said, أَخُوكَ وَ رُبَّمَا خَانَكَ (assumed tropical:)  [It is thy brother, but<br>\
sometimes it is unfaithful to thee]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
خَانَتْهُ رِجْلَاهُ (assumed tropical:)  [His two legs were unfaithful to<br>\
him;] he was unable to walk. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
خان الدَّلْوَ الرِّشَآءُ (assumed tropical:)  The well-rope broke off, or be<br>\
came severed, from the bucket. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
خانهُ الدَّهْرُ, inf. n. خَوْنٌ; (T, TA;) and ↓ تخوّنهُ;<br>\
(TA;) (assumed tropical:)  Time altered his state, or condition,<br>\
(T, TA,) from softness, or easiness, to hardness,<br>\
or difficulty, (TA,) or to evil; (T, TA;) and in<br>\
like manner, النَّعِيمُ [enjoyment, &amp;c.]: and of<br>\
everything that has altered thy state, or condition,<br>\
[for the worse,] one says, ↓ تَخَوَّنَكَ. (T, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
خوّنهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَخْوِينٌ, (K,) He attributed to him خِيَانَة [i. e. treachery, perfidy, or<br>\
unfaithfulness]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 5, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
5<br>\
تخوّنهُ: see 1, last sentence, in two places.<br>\
You say also, تَخَوَّنَهُمْ meaning He sought [to<br>\
discover, or show,] their خِيَانَة [i. e. treachery,<br>\
perfidy, or unfaithfulness], and their slip, lapse,<br>\
or wrong action; and suspected them, or accused<br>\
them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He, or it, diminished it,<br>\
wasted it, impaired it, or took from it; and so<br>\
↓ خوّنهُ, and خوّن مِنْهُ: (K:) or diminished it,<br>\
wasted it, impaired it, or took from it, by little<br>\
and little; syn. تَنَقَّصَهُ. (JK, * S, Msb.) You<br>\
say, تَخَوَنَنِى فُلَانٌ حَقِّى Such a one took from<br>\
me by little and little of my right, or due. (S,<br>\
TA.) And Dhu-r-Rummeh says,<br>\
لَا بَلْ هُوَ الشَّوْقُ مِنْ دَارٍ تَخَوَّنَهَا<br>\
مَرًّا سَحَابٌ وَمَرًّا بَارِحٌ تَرِبُ<br>\
[No, but it is, or was, yearning of the soul<br>\
arising from a place of abode from which some<br>\
times raining clouds, and sometimes a hot wind<br>\
carrying with it dust, took away by little and<br>\
little, so as gradually to efface the traces thereof].<br>\
(S, TA.) And Lebeed says, (S, TA,) describing<br>\
a she-camel, (TA,)<br>\
تَخَوَّنَهَا نُزُولِى وَارْتِحَالِى<br>\
[Which my alighting and my journeying had<br>\
wasted by little and little;] i. e. whose flesh and<br>\
fat my alighting and my journeying had diminished by little and little. (S, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
He paid frequent attention to him, or it; or he,<br>\
or it, returned to him, or it, time after time;<br>\
syn. تَعَهَّدَهُ; (JK, S, K;) and so ↓ خوّنهُ: (K:)<br>\
in this sense, the former verb is [said to be] from<br>\
تخوّلهُ, by the substitution of ن for ل (TA.)<br>\
Dhu-r-Rummeh says, [describing a young gazelle,]<br>\
لَا يَنْعَشُ الطَّرْفَ إِلَّا مَا تَخَوَّنَهُ<br>\
دَاعٍ يُنَادِيهِ بِاسْمِ المَآءِ مَبْغُومُ<br>\
(S,) [He raises not his eye, or eyes, except when<br>\
a caller calling him by the sound of مَآءِ returns<br>\
to him time after time, addressed by the cry<br>\
termed بُغَام:] i. e. except when he hears the<br>\
بُغَام of his mother calling him by the cry مَآءِ مَآءِ:<br>\
(TA in art. بغم: [it is there added, that the<br>\
pass. part. n. مَبْغُوم is used in this instance for<br>\
the act. part. n.; but for this I see no sufficient<br>\
reason:]) he says that the young gazelle is slum<br>\
bering, not raising his eye, or eyes, unless his<br>\
mother comes to him time after time: or, as<br>\
some say, unless his mother&#39;s call to him takes<br>\
by little and little from his sleep. (S in the<br>\
present art.) One says also الحُمَّىتَخَوَّنُهُ [for<br>\
تَتَخَوَّنُهُ] The fever returns to him time after<br>\
time: (S:) or in its time. (TA.)<br>\
