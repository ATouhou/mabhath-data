خَجِلَ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
خَجَلَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
خَجَلٌ, (S, Msb, &amp;c.,) but not خَجَالَةٌ, [though<br>\
authorized by the KL, in my copy of which I<br>\
find it thus written (not خِجَالَةٌ as written by<br>\
Golius),] for this is a vulgar mistake for خَجَلَةٌ<br>\
or خَجْلٌ, (Mgh, [so in my copy, but correctly<br>\
↓ خَجَلَةٌ (which may be either a simple subst. or<br>\
an inf. n. of un.) or خَجَلٌ,]) He was, or became,<br>\
confounded, or perplexed, and unable to see his<br>\
right course, by reason of shame: (S, O:) or<br>\

perplexed, and unable to see his right course, (T,<br>\
M, K,) [or, simply, ashamed, (see خَجِلٌ,)] in<br>\
consequence of a deed that he had done: (T, M,<br>\
TA:) thus الخَجَلُ has a more particular signification than الحَيَآءُ: (TA:) or it is like الاِسْتِحْيَآءُ.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He remained silent, (T, K,) or<br>\
still, (M,) not speaking nor moving. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
He was, or became, in a confused and dubious<br>\
case, (JK, M, * K, *) so that he knew not how to<br>\
extricate himself from it. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, said<br>\
of a camel, (tropical:)  He went in mud, and became like<br>\
him who is confounded, or perplexed, and unable<br>\
to see his right course: (JK, * M, K, TA:) or<br>\
he stuck fast in mire. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And in like<br>\
manner, (assumed tropical:)  He became agitated, or convulsed, or<br>\
he struggled, or floundered, with his load: (JK:)<br>\
or خَجِلَ بِالْحِمْلِ he was oppressed by the load,<br>\
(K, TA,) so that he was agitated, or convulsed,<br>\

―<br>\
-b6-  And, said of a plant, or of herbage, (tropical:)  It was,<br>\
or became, tall, and tangled, or luxuriant, or<br>\
abundant and dense; (ISd, K, TA;) and so<br>\
↓ اخجل said of the kind of trees termed حَيْض.<br>\
(JK, K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [And, as inf. n. of خَجِلَ,] خَجَلٌ<br>\
also signifies The bearing richness ill; as when,<br>\
being rich, one exults, or exults greatly or excessively, and behaves insolently and unthankfully:<br>\
(S, * K:) or the taking a wide, or an ample,<br>\
range, or being profuse, when rich. (TA.) It is<br>\
related in a trad. that he [Mohammad] said to the<br>\
women, إِذَا جُعْتُنَّ وَ إِذَا شَبِعْتُنَّ خَجِلْتُنَّ,<br>\
(S, * TA,) i. e. When ye are hungry, ye become<br>\
lowly, humble, or submissive, and cleave to the<br>\
dust, or earth; (S and TA in art. دقع;) or ye<br>\
bear poverty ill: (TA in the present art.;) and<br>\
when ye are satiated, [ye bear richness ill; or]<br>\
ye exult, or exult greatly or excessively, and behave insolently and unthankfully. (S in the present<br>\
art.) [See also a verse of El-Kumeyt cited in the<br>\
first paragraph of art. دقع.] ―<br>\

[The being affected with disgust, loathing, or<br>\
