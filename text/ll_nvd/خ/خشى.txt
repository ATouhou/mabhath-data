خَشِىَ, aor. يَخْشَى, inf. n. خَشْيَةٌ (JK, S,<br>\
M, Msb, K) and خَشْىٌ (JK, M, K) and خِشْىٌ<br>\
(Sgh, K) [the second and third erroneously written<br>\
in the CK خَشًا and (by indication) خِشًا] and<br>\
خَشَاةٌ (M, K) and خَشْيَانٌ, (JK, M, K,) though<br>\
it has been said that the only instances of this<br>\
kind are شَنْآنٌ and لَيَّانٌ, [see the former of these<br>\
two,] but in one copy of the M found written<br>\
خِشْيَانٌ, (TA,) and مَخْشَاةٌ (JK, M, K) and<br>\
مَخْشِيَةٌ, (M, K,) He feared; syn. خَافَ: (JK,<br>\
S, M, Msb, K:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib and<br>\
others, he dreaded; or feared with reverence,<br>\
veneration, respect, honour, or awe. (TA.) You<br>\
say, خَشِيَهُ He feared him, or it; [or he dreaded<br>\
him, or it; i. e. feared him, or it, with reverence,<br>\
&amp;c.;] as also ↓ تخشّاهُ. (K.) [And خَشِىَ مِنْهُ,<br>\
meaning the same: or He feared, or dreaded,<br>\
what might happen to him from him, or it.<br>\
And خَشِىَ عَلَيْهِ شَيْئًا He feared, or dreaded, for<br>\
him a thing.] And فَعَلْتُ ذٰلِكَ خَشَاةَ أَنْ يَكُونَ كَذَا<br>\
[I did that in fear, or dread, that such a thing<br>\
might happen]. (IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  خَشَيْتُهُ also signifies Hope. (Er-Rághib, TA.) And the saying<br>\
of Ibn-&#39;Abbás to &#39;Omar, لَقَدْ أَكْثَرْتَ مِنَ الدُّعَآءِ<br>\
بِالمَوْتِ حَتَّى خَشِيتُ أَنْ يَكُونَ ذٰلِكَ أَسْهَلَ لَكَ عِنْدَ<br>\
نُزُولِهِ, is explained as meaning [Verily thou hast<br>\
prayed much for death, so that] I hope [that it<br>\
may be easier to thee when it happens]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And sometimes خَشِيتُ means عَلِمْتُ [I knew,<br>\
or know]. (Msb.) So it is said to mean in the<br>\
saying of the poet.<br>\
وَلَقَدْ خَشِيتُ بِأَ مَنْ تَبِعَ الهُدَى<br>\
سكَنَ الجِنَانَ مَعَ النَّبِىِّ مُحَمَّدِ<br>\
[And I know assuredly that he who follows the<br>\
right direction shall dwell in the gardens of<br>\
Paradise with the Prophet Mohammad]: (S,<br>\
TA:) or the meaning may be, I hope. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  In the saying in the Kur [xviii. 79], فَخَشِينَا<br>\
أَنْ يُرْهِقَهُمَا طُغْيَانًا وَكُفْرًا, the meaning is said, by<br>\
Akh, to be And we disapproved [that he should<br>\
make excessive disobedience, and ingratitude, to<br>\
come upon them twain]; (S;) and so says Zj, explaining it as the saying of El-Khidr: or, accord.<br>\
to Fr, the meaning is, and we knew. (TA. [See<br>\
also أَزْهَقَ.])<br>\
-A2-  خَاشَانِى فَخَشَيْتُهُ: see 3.<br>\
2<br>\
خشّاهُ, inf. n. تَخْشِيَةٌ, He frightened him, or<br>\
made him to fear; (S, K;) [or he made him to<br>\
dread; or to fear with reverence, &amp;c.; (see 1;)]<br>\
بِالأَمْرِ [with the thing, or event]. (TA.) One<br>\
says, خَشِّ ذُؤَالَةَ بِالحِبَالَةِ, meaning [Frighten thou]<br>\
the wolf [with the snare]. (S. [See art. ذأل.])<br>\
And لَقَدْ كُنْتُ وَمَا أُخَشَّى بِالذِّئْبِ [Verily I used<br>\
to be in a state when I was not frightened by the<br>\
wolf]: a prov. (JK, TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
خَاْشَىَ ↓ خَاشَانِى فَخَشَيْتُهُ, (A&#39;Obeyd, S, K,) aor. of<br>\
the latter أَخْشِيهِ, (A&#39;Obeyd, S,) [I vied with him<br>\
in fear or dread, and] I was more fearful [or<br>\
dreading] than he. (A &#39;Obeyed, S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  خَاشَى<br>\
فُلَانًا, (JK, TA,) inf. n. مُخَاشَاةٌ, (TA,) He left,<br>\
forsook, relinquished, or abandoned, such a one,<br>\
being left, &amp;c., by him. (JK, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  خاشى بِهِمْ<br>\
He guarded himself against them in an extraordinary degree, and was cautious, or wary,<br>\
(JK, TA,) and therefore turned away, or withdrew. (TA.)<br>\

تَخَشَّىَ see 1, second sentence.<br>\
خَشٍ: see what next follows.<br>\
خَشْيَانُ Fearful, or fearing; (S, Msb, TA;)<br>\
[or dreading; i. e. fearing with reverence, &amp;c.:<br>\
(see 1:)] as also ↓ خَاشٍ and ↓ خَشٍ: (K:) fem.<br>\
خَشْيَا, (S, Msb, K, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
خَشْيَآءُ,]) like غَضْبَى fem, of غَضْبَانُ, (Msb,) accord.<br>\
to rule, (TA,) and خَشْيَانَةٌ, mentioned by El-<br>\
arzookee, and thought by MF to be of the<br>\
dial. of Asad; (TA;) or this signifies a wo<br>\
man who fears, or dreads, (تَخْشَى,) everything;<br>\
(JK, TA;) so in the Tekmileh: (TA:) pl.<br>\
خَشَايَا, (K,) pluralized in a similar manner to<br>\
epithets significant of diseases, like حَيَاطَى &amp;c.,<br>\
because الخَشْيَة is like a disease. (TA.)<br>\
خَشَآءٌ Land such as is termed جَهَادٌ [i. e. hard;<br>\
or having no herbage; or hard, and having no herbage; or level; or rugged, &amp;c.]. (JK, Sgh, K.)<br>\
خَشِىٌّ Dry; (As, JK, S, K;) like حَشِىٌّ; (As,<br>\
S;) applied to herbage; (As, S;) or to herbs and<br>\
trees: (JK:) or dry and rotten. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
A rájiz says, (S,) namely, Sakhr, (TA,)<br>\
سَمُّ ذَرَارِيحَ رِطَابٍ وَخَشِىْ<br>\
[Poison of moist cantharides, and dry]; (S,<br>\
TA;) meaning وَخَشِىٍّ, suppressing one of the<br>\
two ىs by poetic license. (IB, TA.)<br>\
خَاشٍ: see خَشْيَانُ.<br>\
أَخْشَى meaning More [and most] fearful, or<br>\
feared, [or dreaded,] (S, K,) is anomalous, (K,)<br>\
being from the pass. [verb, like its syn. أَخْوَفُ].<br>\
(TA.) You say, هٰذَا المَكَانُ أَخْشَى مِنْ ذَاكَ This<br>\
place is more fearful, or feared, [or dreaded,]<br>\
than that. (S, K. *)<br>\
مَخَاشٍ [pl. of مَخْشَاةٌ, originally مَخْشَيَةٌ,] Causes<br>\
of fear [or dread]; syn. مَخَاوِفُ [pl. of مَخَافَةٌ:<br>\
like which, مَخْشَاةٌ is also an inf. n.]. (Har<br>\
p. 138.)<br>\
