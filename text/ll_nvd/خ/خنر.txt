خَنُّورٌ and ↓ خَنَوَّرٌ Any soft and weak tree: (K:)<br>\
or such is called خنورة [i. e. خَنُّورَةٌ or حَنَوَّرَةٌ:<br>\
each, without ة, being app. a coll. gen. n.; and<br>\
with ة, a n. un.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, accord.<br>\
to AHn, (TA,) The reeds of [which are made]<br>\
arrows. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  أُمُّ خَنُّورٍ (S, K) and أُمُّ خِنَّوْرٍ<br>\
(K) The female hyena: (S, K:) or she is called<br>\
by the latter appellation, accord. to Aboo-Riyásh:<br>\
or, as some say, these are surnames of the hyena.<br>\
(TA.) And The cow [probably the wild cow].<br>\
(Aboo-Riyásh, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Calamity, or misfortune. (S, K.) You say, وَقَعَ القَوْمُ فِى أُمِّ خَنُّورٍ The<br>\
people, or party, fell into calamity, or misfortune.<br>\
(L, TA. But see two other explanations in what<br>\
follows.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Plentifulness, and pleasantness<br>\
or easiness, and softness or delicacy, of life; or<br>\
a life of softness or delicacy, and ease, comfort,<br>\
or affluence; syn. النَّعْمَةُ: [in the CK النِّعْمَةُ;<br>\
which is in many instances in the CK, as I hold<br>\
it to be in the present instance, erroneously substituted for النَّعْمَةُ:] thus bearing two contrary<br>\
significations: and الخَنُّورُ and ↓ الخَنَوَّرُ signify<br>\
the same, such as is apparent; (K;) or, as some<br>\
say, abundant. (TA.) Some explain the saying<br>\
above-mentioned as meaning The people, or party,<br>\
fell into a state of plenty, or abundance, and<br>\
softness or delicacy or easiness of life. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And The present world; or the present life, or<br>\
state of existence; as also ↓ أُمُّ خَنَوَّرٍ: (L:) or so<br>\
الخِنَّوْرُ and ↓ الخَنَوَّرُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And The deserts;<br>\
syn. الصَّحَارَى: and so accord. to some in the<br>\
saying mentioned above. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And The<br>\
podex, or the anus; syn. الاِسْتُ: (K:) but<br>\
AHát doubts respecting the teshdeed of the ن;<br>\
[app. whether this letter be doubled, or the و;]<br>\
Aboo-Sahl says that it is أُمُّ خِنَّوْرٍ [only]: and<br>\
IKh says that it means the اِسْت of the bitch.<br>\
