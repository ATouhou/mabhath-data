خَطَا, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor. يَخْطُو, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. خَطْوٌ; (Msb, K;) and ↓ اختطى; (S, K;)<br>\
said of a man (S, Msb, TA) [and of a beast];<br>\
both signify the same; (S, K;) He stepped,<br>\
paced, or walked; (MA, KL;) i. q. مَشَى; (M,<br>\
Msb, K;) as also اِخْتَاطَ, [which see in art. خيط,]<br>\
formed by transposition. (K.) You say, خَطَوْتُ<br>\
خَطْوَةً وَاحِدَةً [I stepped one step]. (JK.) [And<br>\
وَسَّعَ الخَطْوَ He stepped wide.] See also the last<br>\
sentence of the next paragraph.<br>\
2<br>\
خطّى He made to pass over: so in the<br>\
saying, خَطَّى اللّٰهُ نَوْءَهَا God made, or may God<br>\
make, its (a land&#39;s) [rain-giving] star or asterism<br>\
to pass it over, and not send rain upon it: (TA<br>\
in art. خطأ:) but in this case the verb is, (Mgh<br>\
in that art.,) or may be, (TA ibid.,) originally<br>\
خَطَّطَ, the final ط being changed into ى. (Mgh<br>\
and TA ibid. [See 2 in art. خطأ.]) Accord. to<br>\
Fr, خَطَّى السَّهْمَ and خطأ are syn. [as meaning<br>\
He made the arrow to pass over, or to miss, the<br>\
mark]. (TA in art. خطأ.) One says also, in<br>\
praying for a man, خُطِّىَ عَنْهُ السُّوْءُ [May evil be<br>\
made to pass him; or] may evil be repelled from<br>\
him: and one says also خُطِّىَ عَنْكَ May it be<br>\
removed, or put away, from thee: (S, TA:) or<br>\
خُطِّئَ عَنْكَ السُّوْءُ. (ISk, TA in art. خطأ.)<br>\
-A2-  The<br>\
vulgar say [to a she-ass and to a she-camel or<br>\
other beast in a slippery or difficult place] خَطِّى,<br>\
meaning اِمْشِى [for اِمْشِى رُوَيَدًا Step thou leisurely]: but the correct word is ↓ اُخْطُِى [imperative fem. of خَطَا]. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اخطاهُ He (a man) made him (another man)<br>\
to step, pace, or walk. (S, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  أَخْطَيْتُ for<br>\
أَخْطَأْتُ: see the latter.<br>\
5<br>\
تَخَطَّيْتُهُ I stepped, or walked, over him, or<br>\
it: (Msb:) or I passed over and beyond him, or<br>\
it: (S:) or تخطّى النَّاسَ He went over the people,<br>\
(رَكِبَهُمْ,) and passed beyond them; and so<br>\
↓ اِخْتَطَاهُمْ. (K.) One says, تَخَطَّيْتُ رِقَابَ النَّاسِ<br>\
[I stepped over, walked over, passed over and beyond, or went over and passed beyond, the necks<br>\
of the people]. (S, TA.) It is said in a trad. respecting Friday, [of one who came too late to the<br>\
Friday-prayers, as is shown in the TA in art.<br>\
انى,] رَأَى رَجُلًا يَتَخَطَّى رِقَابَ النَّاسِ He saw a man<br>\
passing step by step [over the necks of the people who<br>\
were already in their ranks in the mosque]. (TA.<br>\
[See also Har p. 83.]) One says also, فُلَانٌ لَا<br>\
يَتَخَطَّى عَنِ الطُّنُبِ [Such a one will not step over,<br>\
or beyond, or from, the tent-rope], meaning, will<br>\
not go far from the tent for the purpose of voiding<br>\
his excrement, by reason of his foulness and vileness and uncleanness. (TA.) And تَخَطَّيْتُ<br>\
كَذَا (S, TA) I passed over [to such a thing or<br>\
place or person]: (TA:) one should not say<br>\
تَخَطَّأْتُ [in this sense], with ء. (S, TA.) [Hence<br>\
the following tropical phrases.] تخطّاهُ المَكْرُوهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [What was disliked or hated, or evil, passed over<br>\
him; not alighting upon him]. (TA.) And<br>\
تَخَطَّيْتُ إِلَيْهِ بِالمَكْرُوهِ (tropical:)  [I passed over others to<br>\
him with that which was disliked or hated, or<br>\
evil; i. q. تَجَاوَزْتُ]. (TA.) And تخطّى عَنِّى<br>\
بَصَرُكَ (assumed tropical:)  [Thine eye, or thy sight, passed me over].<br>\
(Aboo-Turáb, TA in art. تيه.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also (assumed tropical:)  I overstepped it, or transgressed it; namely, a limit<br>\
prescribed to me, &amp;c.]<br>\

-A2-  and see also 5.<br>\
خَطْوَةٌ A step, or pace, as meaning a single act<br>\
of stepping or pacing or walking: (JK, S, K,<br>\
Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] خَطَوَاتٌ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
[of mult.] خِطَآءٌ. (S.) Imra-el-Keys says,<br>\
لَهَا وَثَبَاتٌ كَوَثْبِ الشِّبَآءِ<br>\
فَوَادٍ خِطَآءٌ وَوَادٍ مَطِرْ<br>\
[She has bounds like the bounding of gazelles;<br>\
and a valley is stepped over by her with leisurely<br>\
steps, and a valley is trampled over by her rapidly as though it were rained upon]: (S:) i. e.,<br>\
one time she steps, and refrains from running;<br>\
and one time she runs with a running resembling<br>\
rain: but AO relates it otherwise, saying, فَوَادٍ<br>\
خَطِيطٌ [lit. and a valley is not rained upon]: and<br>\
some substitute كَصَوْبِ الخَرِيفِ [like the pouring<br>\
rain of the autumn]. (IB, TA.) [See also what<br>\
next follows.]<br>\
خُطْوَةٌ A step, or pace, as meaning the space<br>\
between the two feet [in walking or running]: pl.<br>\
(of pauc., S) خُطْوَاتٌ (S, Msb, K) and خُطُوَاتٌ<br>\
and خُطَوَاتٌ (S, Msb) and (of mult., S) خُطًى.<br>\
(S, Msb, K.) One says, قَرَّبَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ الخُطْوَةَ,<br>\
meaning May God make short to thee the space,<br>\
or distance. (TA.) And بَيْنَ القَوْلَيْنِ خُطٍى يَسِيرَةٌ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Between the two sayings is little difference.<br>\
(TA.) لَا تَتَّبِعُوا خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ, in the Kur<br>\
[ii. 163 &amp;c.], means [Follow not ye] the ways of<br>\
the Devil: (TA:) or the footsteps of the Devil:<br>\
(JK:) here some read خُطْوَات; and some, accord.<br>\
to Lth, خُطُؤَات, which Az pronounces to have no<br>\
meaning. (TA.)<br>\
خَطِيَّةٌ for خَطِيْئَةٌ: see the latter, in art. خطأ.<br>\
[Freytag, evidently from his having found it incorrectly written for حَظِيَّةٌ, has assigned to it the<br>\
meaning of “ amica,” and “ amata. ”]<br>\
نَاقَتُكَ هٰذِهِ مِنَ المُتَخَطِّيَاتِ الجيف [the last<br>\
word being app. الجِيَفَ] is a saying mentioned<br>\
by AZ: (TA in the present art.:) or من<br>\
المُتَخَطِّئَاتِ الجيف. (TA in art. خطأ, where see<br>\
the explanation.)<br>\
