find قِدْح. Golius explains خَيَّابٌ as meaning<br>\

ignis: but I cannot anywhere find قَدْحٌ or قِدْحٌ<br>\

حيّاب may be [an epithet] of the measure فَعَّال<br>\
from الخَيْبَةُ; [so that the meaning may be (assumed tropical:)  Be<br>\
thou silent, and speak not, for thou art habitually<br>\
unsuccessful; thou art altogether vitious, or<br>\
faulty, and thou art a great imputer of vices,<br>\
or faults, to others;] or the person there men<br>\
tioned may be meant to be likened to the قدح<br>\
