خَفِشَ, aor.<br>\
خَفَشَ, inf. n. خَفَشٌ, He had that<br>\
quality of the eyes, or sight, which is termed خَفَشٌ<br>\
as this word is explained below. (Msb.) And<br>\
خَفِشَتْ عَيْنُهُ His eye had that quality. (A.)<br>\
خَفَشٌ Smallness of the eye, (S, A, K,) or of<br>\
the eyes, (Msb,) and weakness in the sight, by<br>\
nature: (S, A, Msb, K:) or a natural narrowness in the eye: (TA:) and sometimes it is a<br>\
disease: (S, Msb: *) or a corrupt state in the<br>\
eyelids, (Kh, A, K,) and redness, which causes<br>\
the eyes to become narrow, (Kh,) without pain,<br>\
(Kh, A, K,) and without ulceration: (Kh:) and<br>\
(so in the S and A and Msb, but in the K “ or ”)<br>\
nyctalopia; or the seeing by night, (S, A, K,) but<br>\
not by day: (S, K:) or the seeing by night more<br>\
than by day: (Msb:) and in a cloudy day, but<br>\
not in a clear one: (S, A, Msb, K:) and sometimes, (tropical:)  the being affected with ophthalmia, or<br>\
inflammation of the eye with pain and swelling.<br>\
(Msb.) كَأَنَّهْمْ مِعْزَى حَظِيرَةٍ فِى خَفَشٍ [As though<br>\
they were the goats of a pen, in respect of weakness of sight,] is a prov., applied to him who falls<br>\
into blindness or perplexity or the darkness of<br>\
night; because goats are the weakest of the غَنَم<br>\
in rain and cold: originally said by &#39;Áïsheh.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
خُفَّاشٌ The bat; syn. وَطْوَاطٌ; (K;) a certain<br>\
flying thing; (Msb;) that flies by night: (S:)<br>\
so called because it can scarcely see by day;<br>\
(Msb;) or because of the smallness of its eyes<br>\
and the weakness of its sight (K, TA) by day:<br>\
(TA:) its brain, if the hollows of the soles<br>\
of the feet be anointed with it, excites the<br>\
venereal passion: and if burnt, and used as a<br>\
collyrium, it removes, or stops, (according to<br>\
different copies of the K,) whiteness of the eye,<br>\
(K, TA,) and sharpens the sight: (TA:) its<br>\
blood, if smeared upon the pubes of one who has<br>\
nearly attained the age of puberty, prevents the<br>\
growth of hair; (El-Minháj, K;) as some say;<br>\
but this is not true: (El-Minháj:) and if the<br>\
pudendum of her who has difficulty in bringing<br>\
forth, be rubbed gently with its gall-bladder, she<br>\
brings forth immediately: (K, * TA:) the pl. is<br>\
خَفَافِيشُ. (S, K.) [See also خُشَّافٌ.]<br>\
أَخْفَشُ One who has that quality of the eyes,<br>\
or sight, which is termed خَفَشٌ as this word is<br>\
explained above: (S, A, Msb:) and one who contracts his eyes when he looks: (TA:) and one<br>\
who has in his eyes white fluid matter, or motes,<br>\
or the like: (AZ:) fem. خَفْشَآءُ. (Msb.)<br>\
