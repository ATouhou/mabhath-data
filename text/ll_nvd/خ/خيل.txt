خَالَ is syn. with ظَنَّ and تَوَهَّمَ: (TA:) you<br>\
say, خَالَ الشَّىْءَ, (Msb, K,) first pers. خِلْتُ, (JK,<br>\
S,) aor. يَخَالُ, (Msb, K,) first pers. إِخَالُ and<br>\
أَخَالُ, (JK, S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) the former irregular,<br>\
(Msb,) but the more chaste of the two, (S,) and<br>\
the more used, (Msb,) of the dial. of Teiyi, but<br>\
commonly used by others also, (El-Marzookee,<br>\
TA,) the latter of the dial. of Benoo-Asad, accord.<br>\
to rule, (S, Msb,) but of weak authority, (K,)<br>\
though some assert it to be the more chaste,<br>\
(TA,) inf. n. خَيْلٌ (S, Msb, K) and خَيْلَةٌ and<br>\
خِيلٌ (K) and خِيلَةٌ (S, K) and خَالٌ and خَيَلَانٌ,<br>\
(K, TA, [the last accord. to the CK خَيَلَالٌ,]) or,<br>\
as in the T [and JK], خِيلَانٌ, (TA,) and خَيْلُولَةٌ<br>\
and مَخِيلَةٌ (S, K) and مَخَالَةٌ; (K;) and خَالَ<br>\
الشَّىْءَ, aor. يَخِيلُ, is a dial. var. thereof; (Msb;)<br>\
meaning ظَنَّةُ [He thought, or opined, the thing:<br>\
and sometimes (see I&#39; Ak p. 109) he knew the<br>\
thing: but it seems to have originally signified<br>\
توهّم الشىءَ, i. e. he surmised, or fancied, the<br>\
thing: see خَالٌ, below]. (S, Msb, K.) This<br>\
verb, being of the class of ظَنَّ, occurs with an inchoative and an enunciative; if commencing the<br>\
phrase, governing them; but if in the middle or<br>\
at the end, it may be made to govern or to have<br>\
no government. (S.) You say, إِخَالُ زَيْدًا أَخَاكَ<br>\
[and, if you will, زَيْدٌ إِخَالُ أَخُوكَ and زَيْدٌ أَخُوكَ<br>\
إِخَالُ, I think Zeyd is thy brother and Zeyd I<br>\
think is thy brother and Zeyd is thy brother I<br>\
think]. (JK.) Hence the prov., مَنْ يَسْمَعْ يَخَلْ,<br>\
(S, TA,) i. e. He who hears the things related of<br>\
men and of their vices, or faults, will think evil<br>\
of them: meaning that it is most safe to keep<br>\
aloof from other men: or, accord. to some, it is<br>\
said on the occasion of verifying an opinion.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 8.<br>\
-A3-  خال عَلَىالمَالِ, aor.<br>\

horse, (JK, K, TA,) aor. يَخَالُ, (K,) inf. n. خَالٌ,<br>\
(JK, K,) He limped, or halted, or was slightly<br>\
lame. (JK, K. *)<br>\

تَخْيِيلٌ signifies The imaging a thing in the<br>\
mind, or fancying it; the forming an image, or<br>\
a fancied image, thereof in the mind: (TA:)<br>\
[and ↓ تَخَيُّلٌ has the same, as well as a quasipass., signification.] You say, [↓ خَيَّلْتُهُ فَتَخَيَّلَ<br>\
لِى and] لِى ↓ فَتَخَيَّلَ ↓ تَخَيَّلْتُهُ [I imaged it in the<br>\
mind, or fancied it, and it became imaged in the<br>\
mind to me, or an object of fancy to me]; like as<br>\
you say, [صَوَّرْتُهُ فَتَصَوَّرَ لِى and] تَصَوَّرْتُهُ فَتَصَوَّرَ لِى:<br>\
(S:) for ↓ تَخَيُّلٌ [as inf. n. of a quasi-pass. verb]<br>\
signifies a thing&#39;s being imaged in the mind, or<br>\
fancied: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and الشَّىْءُ لَهُ ↓ تخيّل<br>\
means تَشَبَّهَ. (K. [And the same is indicated in<br>\
the Msb.]) You say also, خُيِّلَ لَهُ كَذَا [Such a<br>\
thing was imaged to him in the mind; i. e. such<br>\
a thing seemed to him]; from الوَهْمُ and الظَّنُّ:<br>\
(Msb:) and خُيِّلَ إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ كَذَا (S) It was imaged<br>\
to him [in the mind, i. e. it seemed to him,] that<br>\
it was so; syn. شُبِّهَ; (PS;) from التَّخْيِيلُ and<br>\
الوَهْمُ: (S, TA:) and لَهُ أَنَّهُ كَذَا ↓ تَخَيَّلَ signifies<br>\
[in like manner it became imaged &amp;c.; i. e.]<br>\
تَشَبَّهَ; as also ↓ تخايل: (S:) and so the first of<br>\
these three verbs is used in the Kur xx. 69.<br>\
(TA.) And فُلَانٌ يَمْضِى عَلَى مَا خَيَّلَتْ, (JK<br>\
and S in explanation of the phrase فُلَانٌ يَمْضِى<br>\
↓ عَلَىالمُخَيَّلِ,) i. e. شَبَّهَتْ [Such a one goes on,<br>\
notwithstanding what (the mind, or the case,)<br>\
may image to him, or what is fancied by him, of<br>\
danger of difficulty; النَّفْسُ, or الحَالُ, accord. to<br>\
Z, (see Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 94,) being understood]; meaning, notwithstanding peril, or<br>\
risk; without any certain knowledge. (S.)<br>\
Whence the prov.,<br>\
عَلَىمَا خُيِّلَتْ وَعْثُ القَصِيمِ<br>\
i. e. I will go on, notwithstanding what the soft<br>\
tracts abounding in sand in which the feet sink<br>\
may be imagined to be: [or the right reading is<br>\
probably خَيَّلَتْ, i. e. notwithstanding what the<br>\
soft tracts &amp;c. may image to the mind, of danger<br>\
or difficulty:] the ت in خيّلت relates to the word<br>\
وعث, which is [regarded as] pl. of وَعْثَةٌ; and<br>\
على is a connective of a suppressed verb, namely,<br>\
أَمْضِى, with what follows it: the meaning is, I<br>\
will assuredly venture upon the affair, notwithstanding its terribleness. (Meyd.) And اِفْعَلْ<br>\
ذٰلِكَ عَلَى مَا خَيَّلَتْ, i. e. عَلَى مَا شَبَّهَتْ [Do thou<br>\
that, notwithstanding what (the mind, or the case,<br>\
as explained above,) may image to thee, of danger<br>\
or difficulty]; (JK;) meaning, in any case.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] خيّل لِلنَّاقَةِ, and ↓ أَخْيَلَ, He<br>\
put a خَيَال [q. v.] near the she-camel&#39;s young one,<br>\
in order that the wolf might be scared away from<br>\
him, (JK, * S, K, *) and not approach him. (JK,<br>\
S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And خيّل فِيهِ الخَيْرَ He perceived, or discovered, in him an indication, or external sign, of<br>\
good; as also ↓ تخيّلهُ (K, TA) and تخوّلهُ:<br>\
(TA: [see also 4 in art. خول:]) or you say,<br>\
عَلَيْهِ ↓ تَخَيَّلَتْ, (T, S, TA,) meaning I knew him;<br>\
or knew his internal, or real, state; (تَخَبَّرْتُهُ, T,<br>\
TA;) or I chose him; (اِخْتَرْتُهُ, S, TA;) and<br>\
perceived, or discovered, in him an indication, or<br>\
external sign, of good. (T, S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And خيّل<br>\
عَلَيْهِ, (S, Msb, K,) inf.n. تَخْيِيلٌ (Msb, K) and<br>\
↓ تَخَيُّلٌ, (K,) [the latter anomalous, being properly inf. n. of تَخَيَّلَ,] He conveyed doubt, or<br>\
suspicion, (التُّهْمَةَ, S, K, or الوَهْمَ, Msb,) to him;<br>\
so in the M, on the authority of AZ; (TA;)<br>\
i. q. لَبَّسَ عَلَيْهِ [he made (a thing, or case) dubious<br>\
to him]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And خيّلت عَلَيْنَا السَّمَآءُ The<br>\
sky thundered and lightened [over us], and prepared to rain: but when the rain has fallen, the<br>\
term ↓ تَخَيُّلٌ [so in my two copies of the S, app.<br>\
used as an inf. n. of the verb in this phrase, as in<br>\
a case above, or perhaps a mistranscription for<br>\
تَخْيِيلٌ, though it will be seen from what follows<br>\
that خيّلت and تخيّلت are both said of the sky in<br>\
the same sense,] is not used: (S:) or خيّلت<br>\
السَّمَآءُ signifies the sky became clouded, but did<br>\
not rain; (JK, and Har p. 36;) as also ↓ اخالت<br>\
and ↓ تخيّلت and ↓ خايلت: (Har ibid.:) or, as<br>\
also ↓ تخيّلت (Msb, K) and ↓ اخالت, (Msb,) or<br>\
↓ أَخْيَلَت, (K,) the sky prepared to rain, (Msb,<br>\
K, TA,) and thundered and lightened, but did not<br>\
yet rain: (TA:) or, accord. to Az, ↓ اخالت<br>\
السَّمَآءُ signifies the sky became clouded: (Msb,<br>\
TA:) and السَّمَآءُ ↓ تخيّلت the sky became clouded,<br>\
and prepared to rain. (S.) [In like manner,]<br>\
one says also, السَّحَابُ ↓ اخالت and ↓ أَخْيَلَت and<br>\
↓ خايلت The clouds gave hope of rain: (S:) or<br>\
السَّحَابَةُ ↓ اخالت the cloud showed signs of rain,<br>\
so that it was thought [or expected] to rain.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  خيّل also signifies, (JK, TA,) or<br>\
↓ تخيّل, (Ham p. 39,) [or each of these,] He<br>\
(a man) was cowardly, or weak-hearted, on the<br>\
occasion of fight, (JK, TA, and Ham,) and did<br>\
not act, or proceed, firmly, or steadily. (Ham.)<br>\
And خيّل عَنِ القَوْمِ and ↓ أَخْيَلَ, [but the former<br>\
only is explained in this sense in the TA,] He<br>\
held back from the people, or party, through<br>\
cowardice: (K, TA:) so says Az, on the authority of&#39; Arrám. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
خايلهُ, (JK, TA,) inf. n. مُخَايَلَةٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
He vied with him, rivalled him, or imitated him,<br>\
(JK, S, * K, * TA,) in pride and self-conceit; (JK;)<br>\
did as he did. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  خايلت السَّمَآءُ, and<br>\
السَّحَابُ: see 2, in the latter part of the paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
اخال It (a thing) was, or became, dubious,<br>\
or confused, or vague, (JK, S, Mgh, Msb, TA,)<br>\
عَلَيْهِ to him. (JK, Mgh.) One says, هٰذَا أَمْرٌ لَا<br>\
يُخِيلُ [This is a thing, or an affair, or a case,<br>\
that will not be dubious, &amp;c.]. (S.) And لَا يُخِيلُ<br>\
ذَاكَ عَلَى أَحَدٍ That will not be dubious, &amp;c., to<br>\
any one. (JK.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اخال الشَّىْءُ إِلَى الخَيْرِ, and<br>\
المَكْرُوهِ, The thing exhibited an indication, or indications, of good, and of evil, or what was disliked or hated. (Msb.) [Hence,] اخالت السَّمَآءُ,<br>\
and أَخْيَلَت: see 2, in the latter part of the paragraph, in four places. And اخالت السَّحَابُ and<br>\
أَخْيَلَت, or اخالت السَّحَابَةُ: see, again, 2, in the<br>\
latter part of the paragraph, in three places. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And hence, in the opinion of ISd, the she-camel<br>\
in this case being likened to clouds [giving hope,<br>\
or showing signs, of rain], (TA,) اخالت النَّاقَةُ<br>\
(tropical:) The she-camel had milk in her udder, (JK, K,<br>\
TA,) and was in good condition of body. (JK,<br>\

أَخَلْنَا We watched, or observed, or looked at, a<br>\

is shown by an explanation of the part. n. of the<br>\
verb, below,) (assumed tropical:)  the land had its plants, or herbage,<br>\
in a state of full maturity, and in blossom; and<br>\
so ↓ تخايلت; whence,] a poet says,<br>\

رُبَاهُ وَحَتَّى مَا تُرَى الشَّآءُ نُوَّمَا<br>\
[The herbage in it became, or had become, tangled,<br>\
