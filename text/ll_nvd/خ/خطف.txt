خَطِفَهُ, aor.<br>\
خَطَفَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
خَطْفٌ; (S, TA;) this is the approved form of<br>\
the verb; (T, S;) and خَطَفَهُ, aor.<br>\
خَطِفَ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. as above; (Msb;) a form of the verb<br>\
mentioned by Akh, (S,) but this is rare, (S, K,)<br>\
or (K) bad, (S, K,) scarcely, or not at all, known;<br>\
(S;) and ↓ اختطفهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) and<br>\
↓ تخطّفهُ; (S Msb, TA;) He seized it; or took<br>\
it, or carried it off, by force: (S, K:) or he did<br>\
so quickly; snatched it away: (Mgh, Msb, TA:)<br>\
and ↓ خطّف has been said to imply repetition of<br>\
the action [unless it be a variation of اختطف as<br>\
in a case mentioned below]; but this is strange,<br>\
and not known on any other authority than that<br>\
of the “ Akáneem et-Taaleem ” by El-Khuweiyee,<br>\
a disciple of El-Fakhr Er-Rázee. (MF, TA.)<br>\
Hence, in the Kur [xxix. 67],وَيُتَخَطَّفُ ↓ النَّاسُ  <br>\
مِنْ حَوْلِهِمْ CCC [And men are carried off by force<br>\
from around them]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,]<br>\
هٰذَا سَيْفٌ يَخْطَفُ الرَّأْسَ (tropical:)  [This is a sword that<br>\
will strike off the head]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And خَطِفَ<br>\
البَصَرَ and خَطَفَهُ, said of lightning, (K,) and<br>\
of a ray of light, and of a [glistening] sword,<br>\
and of any polished body, (TA,) (tropical:)  It took<br>\
away the sight: (K, TA:) and ↓اُخْتُطِفَ<br>\
بَصَرُهُ (tropical:) His sight was suddenly taken away.<br>\
(M and K in art. ملس.) It is said in the<br>\
Kur [ii. 19], يَكَادُ البَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَارَهُمْ (tropical:) [The<br>\
lightning almost taketh away their sight, lit.<br>\
sights]: (TA:) Yoo read يَخْطِفُ ابصارهم; (S,<br>\
TA;) and so did Aboo-Rejà and Mujáhid: and<br>\
some read ↓يِخِطِّفُ, and ↓يَخَطِّفُ, originally<br>\
يَخْتَطِفُ, accord. to the opinion of the Basrees,<br>\
disputed by Fr, but confirmed by Zj. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And خَطِفَ السَّمْعَ, (K,) aor.<br>\
خَطَفَ, (S,) said of a<br>\
devil, (tropical:)  He stole [an opportunity of] hearing [the<br>\
speech of the angels, from the confines of the<br>\
lowest Heaven; or snatched it]; (S, K, TA;)<br>\
as also ↓اختطفهُ: (K:) the two verbs being like<br>\
نَزَعَهُ and اِنْتَزَعَهُ. (Sb, TA.) Hence, in the Kur<br>\
[xxxvii. 10], ↓إِلَّا مَنْ خَطِفَ الخَطْفَةَ (tropical:)  Except<br>\
him who steals the [opportunity of] hearing:<br>\
(TA:) or who snatches unawares and by stealth,<br>\
(Bd,) or hears and snatches, (Jel,) the speech of<br>\
the angels: (Bd, Jel:) EL-Hasan read ↓ الّا من خَطَّفَ<br>\
الخطفة,  originally اخْتَطَفَ: (S, TA:)<br>\
and another reading, ascribed to him and others,<br>\
is ↓خِطِّفَ; but this is very weak. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
خَطِفَ, aor.<br>\
خَطَفَ; and خَطَفَ, aor.<br>\
خَطِفَ; inf. n. خَطَفَانٌ;<br>\

little. (JK.) And اخطف الرَّمِيَّةَ (assumed tropical:) He missed the<br>\
animal at which he shot or cast, (JK, S, K,)<br>\
nearly hitting it: (JK:) and in like manner,<br>\
الشَّىْءَ the thing. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA.) And He<br>\
captured, or caught, the animal at which he shot or<br>\
cast; expl. by إِذَا كَانَ يَصِيدُهَا [perhaps a mistranscription for يُصِيبُهَا, and, if so, meaning he hit].<br>\
(JK.) And اخطف said of an arrow, (assumed tropical:)  [It missed:<br>\
or it fell upon the ground, and then glided along<br>\
upon the ground to the butt, or object of aim:<br>\
(see خَاطِفٌ:) and] it went straight. (TA.) ―<br>\

says that it is, in horses, (assumed tropical:)  smallness of the جَوْف<br>\

of ضَارِبٌ], or a sing. (TA.)<br>\
خَطْفَةٌ A single act of seizing; or, of taking,<br>\
or carrying off, by force: (TA:) or, of doing<br>\
so quickly; of snatching away. (Mgh, Msb,<br>\
TA.) Hence, [in a trad.,] accord. to one reading,<br>\
نَهَى عَنْ كُلِّ ذِى خَطْفَةٍ, meaning He prohibited<br>\
the prey of whatever snatches away the prey, and<br>\
goes away with it, not withholding it for its<br>\
owner: or, as some say, what snatches away with<br>\
its talon, or claw: but the reading commonly<br>\
known is, نَهَى عَنِ الخَطْفَةِ: (Mgh:) and الخَطْفَةُ<br>\

while the animal is alive: (Mgh, TA:) or the<br>\
limb, or member, which the beast or bird of prey<br>\
seizes, or carries off by force, or which a man<br>\

for whatever is separated from the living animal,<br>\
(Mgh, TA,) of flesh or fat, (TA,) is carrion,<br>\
(Mgh, TA,) unlawful to be eaten: the prohibition<br>\
originated from the Prophet&#39;s finding, when he<br>\
came to El-Medeeneh, that the people loved and<br>\
ate the humps of camels and the tails of sheep:<br>\
(TA:) the reading الخَطَفَة, of the measure فَعَلَة,<br>\
with fet-h to the medial radical letter, as pl. of<br>\
خَاطِفٌ, is a mistake. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A single<br>\

says that it is [what is called] جَبُولَآءُ [a word I<br>\
have not found in any other instance]: (S:) or,<br>\
with the Arabs, it is a food made with milk<br>\
(لَبَنِيَّةٌ), which is heated, then flour is sprinkled<br>\
upon it, and then it is cooked, and people lick it,<br>\
or eat it with the finger, snatching it up hastily.<br>\
