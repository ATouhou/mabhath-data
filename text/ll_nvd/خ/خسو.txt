خسّى, (so in some copies of the K, and in<br>\
the TA,) in [some of] the copies of the K تخسّى,<br>\
but the former is the right, (TA,) inf. n. تَخْسِيَةٌ,<br>\
He played with walnuts at the game of odd or<br>\
even; (K, TA;) as also ↓ اخسى: and ↓ خاساهُ,<br>\
(inf. n. مُخَاسَاةٌ, TA,) He played with him at that<br>\
game: (K:) or you say, هُوَ يُخَسِّى وَ يُزَكِّى He<br>\
plays, and says, “Is it even or odd?” (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
خَاْسَوَand 4: see above.<br>\
6<br>\
تَخَاسَا They (two men) played together at<br>\
the game of odd or even. (JK, * TA.)<br>\
خَسَا, (JK, K, * and TA in art. زكو,) without<br>\
tenween, and accord. to some with tenween, and<br>\
not having the article ال prefixed to it; and in<br>\
like manner زَكَا, which is coupled with the<br>\
former, is without tenween, and accord. to some<br>\
with tenween, and not having the article ال<br>\
prefixed to it; (TA in that art.;) [but each has<br>\
ال prefixed to it in the K;] accord. to Fr, some<br>\
make it quasi-coordinate to فَتًى [i. e. with tenween, and masc.]; some, to زفر [app. meaning<br>\
the proper name زُفَرُ i. e. without tenween, and<br>\
masc.]; and some, to سَكْرَى [app. meaning without tenween, and fem.]: (TA:) a word that is<br>\
said in playing with walnuts; (JK;) An odd<br>\
number: (Lth, Fr, K, TA:) and زكا signifies an<br>\
even number: (Lth, Fr, TA:) accord. to IB, its<br>\
final letter is hemzeh, for one says, يُخَاسِئُ<br>\
meaning يُقَامِرُ [he contends in a game of hazard];<br>\
but it is pronounced without ء to assimilate it to<br>\
زكا: (TA:) the pl. is أَخَاسٍ, (K, TA,) accord.<br>\
to the M, مَخَاسٍ, like مَسَاوٍ, (TA, [but the former<br>\
pl. occurs in a verse cited in the TA,]) which is<br>\
anomalous. (K.) One says, خَسًا أَوْ زَكًا, [so in<br>\
my copies of the S, with tenween,] i. e. Odd or<br>\
even? (S:) [or خَسَا أَوْ زَكَا, as shown above:]<br>\
and some say, خَسَا زَكَا, like خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ. (IB,<br>\
TA.) And it is said in a trad., مَا أَدْرِى كَمْ حَدَّثَنِى<br>\
أَبِى عِنْ رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ أَخْسَا أَمْ<br>\
زَكَا, or أَخْسًا أَمْ زَكًا, [for the vowel-signs are not<br>\
written in my original,] meaning فَرْدًا أَمْ زَوْجًا<br>\
[i. e. I know not how many times my father told<br>\
me, from the Apostle of God, God bless and save<br>\
him; whether an odd or an even number: or,<br>\
perhaps, once or twice]. (TA.)<br>\
