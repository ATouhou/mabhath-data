perfidiously and treacherously: for they (i. e.<br>\
women) are possessed of secret malevolence: may<br>\
they be disgraced and accursed:] خطّيبى is syn.<br>\
with خِطْبَة: (S:) accord. to Lth, it is a simple<br>\

agreed, nor approved each other, nor has either<br>\
of them inclined to the other. (TA.) ―<br>\

(K,) meaning I am an asker, or demander, in<br>\
marriage; (MF;) and he who desired to give to<br>\
him in marriage would reply نِكْحٌ, (A, K, *) and<br>\
نُكْحٌ, (K,) [meaning I am “ a giver in marriage,”]<br>\
and thus marriage was effected: there was a<br>\
woman among them, called Umm-Khárijeh, and<br>\
the man who asked her in marriage used to<br>\
stand at the door of her tent, and say, خِطْبٌ; and<br>\
she used to reply, نِكْحٌ; (S, * TA;) and hence<br>\

the marriage of Umm-Khárijeh]. (TA.) ―<br>\

(Aboo-Is-hák, K:) or the old Arabian خُطْبَة, in<br>\
the Pagan and the early Muslim ages, was,<br>\
in most instances, not in rhyming prose; and the<br>\
term “ prose,” as here used, does not exclude<br>\
what contains poetry introduced by way of testimony and the like: (MF:) or [a tract, or small<br>\
treatise or discourse,] like a رِسَالَة, which [is complete in itself, or, in other words,] has a beginning<br>\
and an end: (T, TA:) the pl. is خُطَبٌ: (Msb:)<br>\
and ↓ مَخَاطِبُ, occurring in the following words<br>\
of a trad., مِنْ أَهْلِ المَحَاشِدِ وَالمَخَاطِبِ, meaning<br>\
of those who congregate, and harangue people,<br>\
exciting them to go forth and assemble for seditious purposes, is said to be used in the same<br>\
