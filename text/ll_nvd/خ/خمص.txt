↓ خُمْصَانٌ has no pl. formed by the addition of و<br>\

[also] signifies Hungry, in a pl. sense, (K,) and<br>\
lank in the bellies: (TA:) ↓ مِخْمَاصٌ also signifies<br>\
the same as خَمِيصٌ; and [its pl.] مَخَامِيصُ, lank<br>\

that ↓ أَخْمَصُ, sing. of خُمْصٌ, is also syn. with<br>\

خَمِيصَةٌ A [garment of the kind called] كِسَآء,<br>\
black, square, and having عَلَمَانِ [i. e. two ornamental or coloured or figured borders]: (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, K:) or a black كساء, having a border such<br>\
as is above described (مُعْلَم) at each end, and<br>\
which is of خَزّ, [q. v.], or of wool: (Msb:) if<br>\
not bordered, it is not so called: (S, Msb:) or,<br>\
accord. to As, a مُلَآءَة of wool, or of خَزّ, bordered<br>\
(مُعْلَمَة); not unless bordered: so called because<br>\
of its softness and thinness, and smallness of bulk<br>\
when it is folded: Ahmad Ibn-Fáris says that it<br>\
is the black كِسَآء: and he says that it may be<br>\
thus called because a man wraps himself with it,<br>\
so that it is against his أَخْمَص, meaning by this<br>\
his waist: (Har p. 21:) pl. خَمَائِصُ: or خمائص<br>\
are garments of خَزّ, thick, black, and red, and<br>\
having thick أَعْلَام [or borders such as above described]; worn by people of old. (TA.) El-Aashà<br>\
says,<br>\
إِذَا جُرِّدَتْ يَوْمًا حَسِبْتَ خَمِيصَةً<br>\
عَلَيْهَا وَ جِرْيَالَ النَّضِيرِ الدُّلَامِصَا<br>\
[When she is stripped of her clothing, any day,<br>\
thou wouldst think there was upon her a khameesah, and the glistening redness of gold]: As<br>\
says, he likens her [long and spreading] hair to a<br>\
خميصة, which is black. (S.) [See also خَمِيسٌ,<br>\
voce خِمْسٌ, near the end of the paragraph.]<br>\
خَامِصُ البَطْنِ: see خَمِيصٌ.<br>\
أَخْمَصُ القَدَمِ A man whose foot rises from the<br>\
ground, [or is hollow in the middle of the sole,]<br>\
so that it does not touch it: fem. خَمْصَآءُ: and<br>\
pl. خُمْصٌ: (Msb:) and ↓ خُمْصَانٌ signifies having<br>\
the middle of the sole of the foot moderately rising<br>\
from the ground; which is a goodly quality;<br>\
but when it is flat, or rises much, it is dispraised:<br>\
so explained by IAar when he was asked by Th<br>\
respecting &#39;Alee&#39;s saying of Mohammad, [cited,<br>\
but not explained, in the K,] كَانَ خُمْصَانَ<br>\
الأَخْمَصَيْنِ: or, accord. to Az, خُمْصَانٌ signifies<br>\
having the part [of the sole] of the foot which<br>\
does not cleave to the ground in treading very<br>\
much retiring from the ground. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
الأَخْمَصُ [when without the article ال also written<br>\
without tenween accord. to the best authorities,<br>\
because the quality of an epithet is original to it,<br>\
and that of a subst. is accidental,] also signifies<br>\
The part [of the sole] of the human foot which<br>\
does not cleave to the ground in treading; (Az,<br>\
TA;) the part of the sole of the human foot which<br>\
is hollow, so that it does not touch the ground;<br>\
(S, K; *) the part of the bottom of the human foot<br>\
which is thin, and retires from the ground; or,<br>\
as some explain it, [meaning the same,] the خَصْر<br>\
of the human foot: (TA:) pl. أَخَامِصُ. (Msb.)<br>\
