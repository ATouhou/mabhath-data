―<br>\
-b2-  And (as some say, TA) He, or it, fell; (S,<br>\

فِى البِئْرِ [It fell into the well], said of a bucket.<br>\

carried, away? (A.) And طاح بِهِ فَرَسُهُ His<br>\
horse went away with him [or carried him away]<br>\
like an arrow. (A.) And مَا كَانَتْ إِلَّا مَزْحَةً<br>\

as is also طوّحهُ, (IAar,) and he made it pass<br>\
away. (K.) And He sent him to a land from<br>\

بِثَوْبِهِ He cast his garment [app. meaning himself<br>\

Accidents, or events, that cast into places of<br>\
perdition [cast him thereinto]: (MF, * TK:) one<br>\
should not say المُطَوِّحَاتُ: it is an extr. phrase,<br>\

وَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ accord. to one of the two<br>\
interpretations thereof: (S:) and المَطَاوِحُ ↓ أَطَاحَتْهُ<br>\
and الطَّوَائِحُ signify the same, i. e. قَذَفَتْهُ القَوَاذِفُ;<br>\
(A;) or [rather] the former of these two phrases<br>\
has a similar meaning [i. e. the places of perdition<br>\
caused him to fall thereinto; unless مَطَاوِحُ have<br>\
a signification which I do not find explained].<br>\

him, or made him, to venture upon a desert in<br>\
which perdition was to be feared. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\

and طيّحهُ, (K in art. طيح,) and carried him<br>\

himself hither and thither, (K, TA,) and so طوّح<br>\
بِهِ. (TA.) And طوّح نَفْسَهُ He made himself to<br>\
be, or become, confounded, or perplexed, and<br>\

Golius and Freytag have read الهَوَى. See 5.])<br>\

or shooting. (L, K.) A poet says,<br>\
فأَمَّا وَاحِدٌ فَكَفَاكَ مِنِّى<br>\
فَمَنْ لِيَدٍ تُطَاوِحُهَا الأَيَادِى<br>\
Now as for one, what would proceed from me<br>\

in relation to a horse, app. meaning He made his<br>\
legs to fall in a particular manner: see مِسْعَرٌ.] ―<br>\
