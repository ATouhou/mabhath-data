طِيَرَةٌ, the only instance of the kind except خِيَرَةٌ,<br>\
which is the same in relation to تَخَيَّرَ, (IAth,)<br>\
He augured evil from it; regarded it as an evil<br>\
omen. (S, Msb, K.) The Arabs, when they<br>\
desired to set about an affair, passed by the<br>\
places where birds lay upon the ground, and<br>\
roused them, in order to learn thence whether<br>\
they should proceed or refrain: but the law<br>\
forbade this. (Msb.) They augured evil from<br>\
the croaking of the crow, and from the birds&#39;<br>\
going towards the left; and in like manner, from<br>\
the motions of gazelles. (TA.) تَفَآءَلَ signifies<br>\

L;) said of a horse. (O, L, K.) [A signification<br>\
of the pass. form; as though meaning he was<br>\
made to fly.] ―<br>\
-b6-  (assumed tropical:)  He was [flurried, or] frightened. (O, K.) [As though meaning originally<br>\
he was made to fly by reason of fright.]<br>\
-A2-  استطار<br>\
(tropical:)  It (the dawn) spread; (S, A, Msb, K;) its<br>\
light spread in the horizon: (TA:) [see مُسْتَطِيرٌ:]<br>\
and the verb is used in the same sense in relation<br>\
to other things: (S:) said of lightning, it spread<br>\
in the horizon: and of dust, it spread in the air:<br>\
and of evil, it spread. (TA.) See also 6. ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  It<br>\
(a crack in a wall) appeared and spread. (A.<br>\
[See also استطال.]) It (a slit, or crack, for<br>\

stumble: hence the trad., إِيَّاكَ وَطَيْرَاتِ الشَّبَابِ<br>\

TA,) that is almost made to fly by reason of the<br>\
vehemence of his running; (TA;) as also ↓ مُطَارٌ.<br>\
(K, TA. [The latter word in the CK written<br>\
مَطار; but said in the TA to be with damm, and<br>\
so written in a copy of the A.]) [See also<br>\
طَيُّورٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  See also مُسْتَطِيرٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also A company<br>\
of men. (O.)<br>\
-A3-  As applied to A balance, it is<br>\
not of the language of the Arabs: (O:) [i. e., it<br>\
is post-classical:] it means an assay-balance<br>\
(مِيزَانٌ and مَعْيَارٌ) for gold; so called because of<br>\
the form of a bird, or because of its lightness: or<br>\
the balance for dirhems [or moneys] that is known<br>\
among them [who use it] by the appellation of the<br>\
قارسطون [meaning the<br>\
χαριστίων of Archimedes,<br>\
(as is observed in a note in p. 178 of vol. ii. of<br>\
the sec. ed. of Har,) i. e. the hydrostatic balance]:<br>\
or, accord. to El-Fenjedeehee, the tongue (لِسَات)<br>\
of the balance. (Har pp. 549-50.)<br>\
هُوَ طَيُّورٌ فَيُّورٌ (assumed tropical:)  He is sharp, and quick in<br>\
returning [to a good state], or recovering [from<br>\
his anger]. (K.) [See also طَيَّارٌ.]<br>\
طَائِرٌ A flying thing [whether bird or insect]:<br>\
(Msb, * TA:) pl. ↓ طَيْرٌ, (S, Msb, K,) like as<br>\
صَحْبٌ is pl. of صَاحِبٌ: (S, Msb:) or طَيْرٌ is<br>\
originally an inf. n. of طَارَ: or an epithet contracted from طَيِّرٌ: (TA:) or a quasi-pl. n.; (Mgh,<br>\
TA;) and this is the most correct opinion: (TA:)<br>\
[but see, below, a reason for considering it originally an inf. n.:] and طَائِرٌ may also be quasi-pl. n.,<br>\
like جَامِلٌ and بَاقِرٌ: (TA:) ↓ طَيْرٌ is also sometimes used as a sing.; (Ktr, AO, S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K;) as in the Kur iii. 43 [and v. 110], accord.<br>\
to one reading: (S:) but ISd says, I know not<br>\
how this is, unless it be meant to be [originally]<br>\
an inf. n.: (TA:) [for an inf. n. used as an<br>\
epithet is employed as sing. and pl.:] or طَائِرٌ,<br>\
only, is used as a sing., (Th, IAmb, Msb,) by<br>\
general consent; and AO once said so in common<br>\
with others: (Th:) but ↓ طَيْرٌ has a collective,<br>\
or pl., signification: (IAmb, Msb:) and is fem.:<br>\
(Mgh:) or is more frequently fem. than masc.:<br>\
(IAmb, Msb:) the pl. of طَيْرٌ is طُيُورٌ [a pl. of<br>\
mult.] and أَطْيَارٌ [a pl. of pauc.]: (S, Msb, K:)<br>\
or طُيُورٌ may be pl. of طَائِرٌ, like as سُجُودٌ is pl. of<br>\
سَاجِدٌ: (TA:) طَائِرَةٌ is seldom applied to the<br>\
female. (IAmb, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [الطَّائِر is a name of<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The constellation Cygnus; also called الدَّجَاجَةُ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  هُوَ سَاكِنُ الطَّائِرِ means (tropical:)  He is grave, staid,<br>\
sedate, (K,) or motionless; so that if a bird<br>\
alighted upon him, it would be still; for if a bird<br>\
alight upon a man, and he move in the least, the<br>\
bird flies away. (TA.) Of the same kind also<br>\
is the saying, رُزِقَ فُلَانٌ سُكُونَ الطَّائِرِ وَخَفْضَ الجِنَاحِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Such a one was endowed, or has been endowed,<br>\
with gravity and gentleness]. (TA.) And طُيُورُهُمْ<br>\
سَوَاكِنُ (tropical:)  They are remaining fixed, settled, or at<br>\
rest: and شَالَتْ نَعَامَتُهُمْ signifies the contrary.<br>\
(A, TA.) And ↓ كَأَنَّ عَلَى رُؤُسِهِمُ الطَّيْرَ (tropical:)  [As<br>\
though birds were on their heads] is said of a<br>\
people, meaning them to be motionless by reason<br>\
of reverence: (S, K:) it was said of the Companions of Mohammad, describing them as quiet<br>\
and grave [in his presence], without levity: and<br>\
the origin of the saying is this: that birds alight<br>\
only upon a thing that is still and inanimate:<br>\
(TA:) or that the crow alights upon the head of<br>\
the camel, and picks from it the ticks, (S, K,)<br>\
and the young ones thereof, (S,) and the camel<br>\
does not move (S, K) his head, (S,) lest the crow<br>\
should take fright and fly away. (S, K.) In<br>\
like manner, وَقَعَ طَائِرُهُ means (tropical:)  He became grave,<br>\
or sedate. (Meyd.) And طَائِرُهُ ↓ طَارَ (tropical:)  He became light, or inconstant: (Meyd:) and he became<br>\
angry; (O, K, TA;) like ثَارَ ثَائِرُهُ and فَارَ فَائِرُهُ:<br>\
(TA:) or he hastened, and was light, or active,<br>\
or agile. (Har p. 561.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And it is said in a<br>\
trad., الرُّؤْيَا عَلَى رِجْلِ طَائِرٍ مَا لَمْ تُعَبَّرْ (O, TA)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A dream is unsettled as to its result, or final<br>\
sequel, while it is not interpreted. (TA.) [The<br>\
Arabs hold that the result of a dream is affected<br>\
by its interpretation: wherefore it is added in<br>\
this tradition, and said in others also, that the<br>\
dreamer should not relate his dream, unless to a<br>\
friend or to a person of understanding.] ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
↓ عَيَّثَتْ طَيْرُهُ see expl. in art. عيث. ―<br>\
-b6-  طَائِرٌ also<br>\
signifies A thing from which one augurs either<br>\
good or evil; an omen, a bodement, of good or of<br>\
evil: (K:) and ↓ طِيَرَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ طِيرَةٌ (K)<br>\
and ↓ طِوَرَةٌ (IDrd, Sgh, K, TA [in the CK, in<br>\
this art., erroneously, طُورَةٌ, but in art. طور it is<br>\
طِوَرَة,]) a thing from which one augurs evil; an<br>\
evil omen or bodement; (S, K, &amp;c.;) contr. of<br>\
فَأْلٌ: (TA:) and طَائِرٌ signifies fortune, (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
K, TA,) whether good or evil: (TA:) and especially<br>\
evil fortune; ill luck; as also ↓ طَيْرٌ and ↓ طِيَرَةٌ:<br>\
for the Arabs used to augur evil from the croaking of the crow, and from birds going towards<br>\
the left: [see 5:] (TA:) and ↓ طِيَرَةٌ is an inf. n.<br>\
[or rather a quasi-inf. n.] of تَطَيَّرَ, [q. v.,] (IAth,)<br>\
and signifies auguration of evil. (Msb.) The Arabs<br>\
used to say, to a man or other thing from which<br>\
they augured evil, (TA,) طَائِرُ اللّٰهِ لَا طَائِرُكَ, (ISk,<br>\
S, IAmb,) and طائرَ اللّٰه لا طائرَك, meaning What<br>\
God doth and decreeth, not what thou dost and<br>\
causest to be feared: (IAmb:) accord. to ISk,<br>\
one should not say اللّٰهِ ↓ طَيْرُ: (S:) but the Arabs<br>\
are related to have said, also, لَا طَيْرَ إِلَّا طَيْرُ اللّٰهِ<br>\
[There is no evil fortune but that which is of<br>\
God]; like as one says, لَا أَمْرَ إِلَّا أَمْرُ اللّٰهِ. (As,<br>\
S.) They also used to say, جَرَى لَهُ الطَّائِرُ بِأَمْرِ كَذَا<br>\
[Fortune brought to him such an event]: and<br>\
hence fortune, whether good or evil, is called<br>\
طائر. (TA.) And it is said in the Kur [vii.<br>\
128], إِنَّمَا طَائِرُهُمْ عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ, meaning Their evil<br>\
fortune, which will overtake them, is only that<br>\
which is threatened to befall them in the latter<br>\
state, [with God,] and not that which befalls them<br>\
in the present state of existence: (TA:) or the<br>\
cause of their good and evil is only with God;<br>\
i. e., it is his decree and will: or the cause of<br>\
their evil fortune is only with God; i. e., it is<br>\
their works, which are registered with Him.<br>\
(Bd.) It is said in a trad., that Mohammad<br>\
liked what is termed فَأْل, and disliked what is<br>\
termed ↓ طِيَرَة: (S:) and in another, that he<br>\
denied there being any such thing as the latter.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The means of subsistence; syn.<br>\
رِزْقٌ. (K:) or misery: or happiness: every one<br>\
of these three significations has been assigned to it<br>\
in the Kur xvii. 14: in which, accord. to AM,<br>\
it is meant that God has decreed to every man<br>\
happiness or misery, according as He foresaw<br>\
that he would be obedient or disobedient. (TA.)<br>\
[See also what immediately follows.]<br>\
-A3-  Also<br>\
The actions of a man which are [as it were] attached as a necklace to his neck. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
And this is [also said by some to be] its signification in the Kur xvii. 14. (Jel.) [The actions<br>\
of a man are the cause of his happiness or<br>\
misery.]<br>\
-A4-  الطَّائِرُ signifies also The brain. (AAF,<br>\
L, K.)<br>\
أَطْيَرُ مِنْ عُقَابٍ [More swift of flight than an<br>\
eagle] is a prov. said of an عقاب because it may be<br>\
in the morning in El-&#39; Irák and in the evening in<br>\
El- Yemen. (Meyd.)<br>\
مَطَارٌ [A place to or from which a bird or other<br>\
thing flies: in the phrase طَارَ قَلْبِى مَطَارَهُ, (see 1,)<br>\
it lit. signifies a place to which one would fly:] a<br>\
place of flying. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَرْضٌ مَطَارَةٌ [and ↓ مُطِيرَةٌ<br>\
(see 4)] A land abounding with birds. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  حَفْرٌ مَطَارٌ, (O,) and بِئْرٌ مَطَارَةٌ, (O, K,) [A pit,<br>\
or cavity, and a well,] wide in the mouth. (O, K.)<br>\
مُطَارٌ Made to fly away: En-Nábighah says,<br>\
وَلِرَهْطِ حَرَّابٍ وَقَدٍّ سُورَةٌ<br>\

[And to the family of Harráb and Kadd belongs<br>\
an eminence in glory of which they fear not any<br>\
diminution: lit., of which the crow is not made<br>\
to fly away; the greatness of their glory being<br>\
likened to abundant seed-produce, as has been<br>\
shown above: see 2]: (S:) A &#39;Obeyd says that<br>\
Harráb and Kadd were two men of the BenooAsad. (TA in art. قد.) ―<br>\

preparation thereof: (AHn, TA:) or such as is<br>\

(O, K. *)<br>\
مُسْتَطَارٌ [Made to fly. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
horse that hastens, or is quick, in running: (K:)<br>\
that runs quickly. (TS, L.) It is contracted by<br>\
the poet &#39;Adee into مُسْطَار, or مُصْطَار. (TA.)<br>\
And مُسْطَارٌ for مُسْتَطَارٌ is applied as an epithet to<br>\
