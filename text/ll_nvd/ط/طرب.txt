طَرِبَ, (S, Msb, TA,) aor.<br>\
طَرَبَ, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
طَرَبٌ, (S, * Msb, K, * TA,) He was, or became,<br>\
affected with emotion, or a lively emotion, or<br>\
excitement, agitation, or unsteadiness, (خِفَّة, S,<br>\
Msb, K, TA,) [of the heart or mind,] by reason<br>\
of joy or of grief, (K, TA,) or of intense grief or<br>\
joy, (S,) or of intense fear or joy: (Msb:) or [he<br>\
was moved with joy, or delight;] he was joyful,<br>\
mirthful, or glad: and the contr., i. e. he was<br>\
affected with grief, sadness, or sorrow. (K, *<br>\
TA.) [See طَرَبٌ, below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And طَرِبَتِ الإِبِلُ<br>\
لِلْحُدَآءِ [The camels became excited by reason of<br>\
the driver&#39;s urging them with singing]. (A, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And طربت عَنِ الطَّرِيقِ [written in the TA<br>\
without any syll. signs, app. طَرِبْتُ,] i. q. عدلت<br>\
عنه [i. e. I deviated (عَدَلْتُ) from the road, or<br>\
way]. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
طرّب, (TA,) inf. n. تَطْرِيبٌ, (K,) He sang.<br>\
(K, TA.) And طرّب فِى صَوْتِهِ He trilled, or<br>\
quavered, and prolonged, his voice: (Msb:) or<br>\
التَّطْرِيبُ فِى الصَّوْتِ is the prolonging of the voice,<br>\
and modulating it sweetly. (S, TA.) And, said<br>\
of a bird, or, accord. to some, peculiarly of the<br>\
مُكَّآء, It prolonged its voice, and trilled, or<br>\
quavered, it, or warbled. (TA.) And in like<br>\
manner, طرّب فِى قِرَآءَتِهِ (A, TA) He prolonged,<br>\
and trilled, or quavered, his voice in his reciting,<br>\
or reading; (TA;) and فِى غِنَائِهِ [in his singing].<br>\
(A.) And قَرَأَ بِالتَّطْرِيبِ [He recited, or read,<br>\
with a prolonging, and trilling, or quavering, of<br>\
the voice]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And طَرَّبُوا They raised<br>\
their voices, cried out, or cried aloud, time after<br>\
time. (Skr, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  طّربهُ: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Freytag<br>\
adds that, in the “ Fákihet el-Khulafà,” p. 42, l.<br>\
5 infr., it means He asserted him to have sung<br>\
excellently.]<br>\
4<br>\
اطرّبهُ He, (S,) or it, (one&#39;s voice, A,)<br>\
caused him to be affected with طَرَب [i. e. emotion,<br>\
or a lively emotion, &amp;c.]; as also ↓ تطرّبهُ; (S,<br>\
A;) [and ↓ طرّبهُ; for] تَطْرِيبٌ signifies the same<br>\
as إِطْرَابٌ, like ↓ تَطَرُّبٌ; (K:) [generally, he, or<br>\
it, rendered him lively, brisk, or sprightly: and]<br>\
اطربهُ is said of joy, and of grief, meaning [it<br>\
affected him with طَرَب; or] it rendered him restless, or unsteady. (MA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَطَرَّبَ see the next preceding paragraph, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
10<br>\
استطرب He, or it, sought, or demanded,<br>\
طَرَب [i. e. emotion, or a lively emotion, &amp;c.], (K,<br>\
TA,) and diversion, sport, or play. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And They (a party, or company of men,) became<br>\
affected with intense طَرَب. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  استطرب<br>\
الإِبِلَ He put in motion the camels by urging them<br>\
with singing. (K.) You say استطرب الحُدَاةُ<br>\
الإِبِلَ [The drivers, singing to them, excited, moved,<br>\
or stirred, the camels,] when the camels have become lively, brisk, sprightly, or agile, because of<br>\
their urging them with singing. (O, TA.) Az<br>\
cites the saying of Et-Tirimmáh,<br>\
وَاسْتَطْرَبَتْ ظُعْنُهُمْ لَمَّا احْزَأَلَّ بِهِمْ<br>\
آلُ الضُّحَى نَاشِطًا مِنْ دَاعِبَاتِ دَدِ<br>\
but in his poem it is وَاسْتَطْرَفَتْ, with فَاء [i. e.<br>\
with the letter ف]: (O:) [this latter reading is,<br>\
I doubt not, the right; and the meaning seems<br>\
to be, And their women borne in the camel-vehicles, when the mirage of the early part of the<br>\
forenoon elevated them to the eye, elicited anew<br>\
longing desire for their homes, or accustomed<br>\
places, from jocose, sportful females, lit., from<br>\
jesting females of sport or diversion: the verse as<br>\
cited by Az may admit of a similar rendering if<br>\
we suppose استطربت to be there used tropically:<br>\
the writer of my copy of the TA has endeavoured, in marginal notes in the present art. and<br>\
in art. دد, but in my opinion unsatisfactorily, to<br>\
explain it; and has supposed استطربت to mean<br>\
طَرِبَت: his two notes, moreover, are inconsistent:] نَاشِطًا in this verse means شَوْقًا نَازِعًا.<br>\
(K in art. دد. [The verse is there cited with two<br>\
readings differing from the words given by Az;<br>\
وَاسْتَطْرَقَت, thus written with ق instead of ف, a<br>\
manifest mistake, and مِنْ دَاعِبٍ دَدِدِ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
استطربهُ signifies also He asked him to sing.<br>\
(A, TA.)<br>\
طَرَبٌ Emotion, or a lively emotion, or excitement, agitation, or unsteadiness, (خِفَّةٌ, S, A,<br>\
Msb, K,) [of the heart or mind,] by reason of joy<br>\
or grief, (A, K,) or of intense grief or joy, (S,) or<br>\
of intense fear or joy: (Msb:) or joy, mirth, or<br>\
gladness: and the contr., i. e. grief, sadness, or<br>\
sorrow: (Th, K:) or, as some say, the lodgement of joy, mirth, or gladness, and departure of<br>\
grief, sadness, or sorrow: so in the M: (TA:)<br>\
the vulgar apply it peculiarly to joy; (Msb;)<br>\
[but] the application of it peculiarly to joy is a<br>\
mistake: (K:) it signifies also motion; syn.<br>\
حَرَكَةٌ: (K:) it is said in the M, Th says that<br>\
الطَّرَبُ is derived from الحَرَكَةُ; whence it seems<br>\
that الطَّرَبُ is, in his opinion, syn. with الحَرَكَةُ;<br>\
but [ISd adds] I know not this: (TA:) [it does,<br>\
however, obviously imply the signification of<br>\
motion, either ideal or actual:] also desire, or<br>\
yearning or longing of the soul: (K:) the pl. is<br>\
أَطْرَابٌ. (TA.) A poet says, (S,) namely, En-Nábighah El-Jaadee, using it in relation to<br>\
anxiety, (TA,)<br>\
فِى إِثْرِهِمْ ↓ وَأَرَانِى طَرِبًا<br>\
طَرَبَ الوَالِهِ أَوْ كَالْمُخْتَبَلْ<br>\
[And I perceive myself to be affected with<br>\
emotion, or a lively emotion, after them, (i. e.<br>\
after the loss of them,) with the emotion of him<br>\
who is bereft of offspring or friends, or like him<br>\
who is insane in mind]: (S, TA:) الوَالِه here<br>\
signifies الثَّاكِل; and المُخْتَبَل means مَنْ جُنَّ<br>\
فِى عَقْلِهِ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And [the pl.] أَطْرَابٌ signifies Choice sweet-smelling plants: (K:) or<br>\
[simply] sweet-smelling plants: (TA:) and the<br>\
more fragrant of such plants. (O, TA.)<br>\
طَرِبٌ Affected with طَرَب [i. e. emotion, or a<br>\
lively emotion, &amp;c.]: (S, A, O, Msb, TA:) pl.<br>\
طِرَابٌ. (A, TA,) A Hudhalee says,<br>\
بَاتَتْ طِرَابًا وَبَاتَ اللَّيْلَ لَمْ يَنَمِ<br>\
[They passed the night joyful, or glad, and he<br>\
passed the night without sleeping]: (O, TA:)<br>\
meaning that the [wild] bulls or cows, thirsting,<br>\
passed the night joyful on account of the lightning that they saw, and the water for which they<br>\
hoped in consequence thereof. (TA.) See also<br>\
another ex. in the verse cited voce طَرَبٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  إِبِلٌ<br>\
طِرَابٌ means Camels yearning for their accustomed<br>\
places of abode: (S, O, TA:) or they are so<br>\
termed when they are excited (إِذَا طَرِبَتْ) by<br>\
reason of their drivers&#39; urging them with singing.<br>\
(A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The head [meaning the hair of<br>\
the head]: so called because of the sound that it<br>\
makes when it is twisted with fingers: occurring<br>\
in the phrase حَتَّى يَرْنَأَ الطَّرِبَ [That he may dye<br>\
the hair of the head with يُرَنَّأ, i. e. حِنَّآء].<br>\
(L, TA.)<br>\
طَرُوبٌ (A, O, Msb, K, TA) and ↓ مِطْرَابٌ (A,<br>\
O, K, TA) and ↓ مِطْرَابَةٌ [which is of a very unusual form (see مِعْزَابَةٌ)], (Lh, K, TA,) applied to<br>\
a man, (O, K, TA,) Much, or often, affected with<br>\
طَرَب [i. e. emotion, or lively emotion, &amp;c.]: (O,<br>\
Msb, TA:) [but the last is doubly intensive,<br>\
signifying very much, or very often, so affected:]<br>\
pl. [of the second and third] مَطَارِيبُ. (A.) One<br>\
says, ↓ إِذَا خَفَقَتِ المَضَارِيبُ خَفَّتِ المَطَارِيبُ<br>\
[When the plectra of the lutes quiver, the persons<br>\
who are wont to be affected with emotion become<br>\
lively, or light-hearted]. (A, TA.) And حَمَامَةٌ<br>\
↓ مِطْرَابٌ [A pigeon that cooes much or often].<br>\
(A, TA.) And ↓ إِبِلٌ مَطَارِيبُ [Camels that<br>\
yearn much, or often, for their accustomed places<br>\
of abode: or that are much, or often, excited by<br>\
reason of their drivers&#39; urging them with singing:<br>\
see طَرِبٌ]. (A, TA.)<br>\
مَطْرَبٌ and ↓ مَطْرَبَةٌ A separate, or straggling,<br>\
road, or way: (S, O:) or a narrow road, or<br>\
way: (K:) or the former, a conspicuous road or<br>\
way: (IAar, TA:) and the latter, a small road,<br>\
or way, leading into a great one: or a narrow<br>\
road, or way, apart from others: (TA:) or a<br>\
small road, or way, branching off from a main<br>\
road: (O:) pl. مَطَارِبُ: (S, O:) [it is said (but<br>\
see 1, last sentence,) that] there is no verb corresponding thereto. (TA.) A poet says, (S,) namely,<br>\
Aboo-Dhu-eyb, (O, TA,)<br>\
وَمَتْلَفٍ مِثْلِ فَرْقِ الرَّأْسِ تَخْلِجُهُ<br>\
مَطَارِبٌ زَقَبٌ أَمْيَالُهَا فِيحُ<br>\
(S, O, TA) i. e. Many a desert tract, like the<br>\
division of the hair of the head in narrowness,<br>\
narrow conspicuous [or straggling] roads, or<br>\
ways, [whereof the portions over which the eye<br>\
can reach are far-extending,] protract; some of<br>\
these roads, or ways, tending this way and some<br>\
that way. (TA. [مطارب is here with tenween<br>\
for the sake of the measure. See also زَقَبٌ.<br>\
Perhaps the poet means to liken the said roads<br>\
to the ropes of a tent.]) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
↓ لَعَنَ اللّٰهُ مَنْ غَيَّرَ المَطْرَبَةَ [May God curse him<br>\
who alters the مطربة]; i. e., the road thus called.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مَطْرَبَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
مِطْرَابٌ, and its pl.: see طَرُوبٌ, in four places.<br>\
مِطْرَابَةٌ: see طَرُوبٌ.<br>\
