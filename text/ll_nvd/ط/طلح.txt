طَلْحٌ, [a coll. gen. n.,] (S, A, Msb, K, &amp;c.,)<br>\
and طِلَاحٌ; (S, A, K;) the latter said to be pl. of<br>\
طَلْحَةٌ, (TA,) which is the n. un. of طَلْحٌ, (S,)<br>\
or, accord. to Sb, the pl. of طَلْحَةٌ is طُلُوحٌ, like<br>\
as صُخُورٌ is pl. of صَخْرَةٌ; and طِلَاحٌ also; and<br>\
the pl. of طَلْحٌ is أَطْلَاحٌ; (M;) [The acacia, or<br>\
mimosa, gummifera; an appellation applicable<br>\
also to the سَنْط, which produces the gum-arabic:<br>\
(see صَمْغٌ:) the former tree is termed by Forskål<br>\
(Flora Ægypt. Arab. p. cxxiv.) “ mimosa gummifera; ” but it is more commonly termed an<br>\
“ acacia: ” its pods are termed عُلَّفٌ, q. v.:] a<br>\
species of large trees, (S, K,) of the kind called<br>\
عِضَاهٌ; (S, Msb;) growing in El-Hijáz [and<br>\
Egypt and Nubia and other countries]; the<br>\
fruit of which is like that of the سَمُرَة; having<br>\
curved thorns: the places in which it grows are<br>\
the interiors of valleys; and it is that species of<br>\
the عضاه which is the largest in its thorns, and<br>\
the hardest in respect of its wood, and the best in<br>\
respect of its gum: Lth describes it as above,<br>\
and says that it is the same as the أُمُّ غَيْلَانَ [and<br>\
the like is said in the A]: ISh says that it is a<br>\
tall tree, affording a shade in which men and<br>\
camels repose, with few leaves, long and large<br>\
branches, with many thorns, [more] than the<br>\
prickles of the palm-tree, and a great trunk,<br>\
which a man&#39;s arm cannot embrace; the same<br>\
as the امّ غيلان; and grows in the mountains:<br>\
AHn says that it is, of the trees called عضاه, the<br>\
largest, and that which has most leaves, and the<br>\
greenest, and has thick and long thorns, but these<br>\
are of the least hurtful of thorns, producing no<br>\
heat in the foot; it has a fruit (بَرَمَةٌ) of pleasant<br>\
odour; and there is not among the trees called<br>\
عضاه any that produces more gum than it, nor<br>\
any more bulky; and it grows only in rugged,<br>\
hard, fertile ground. (TA.) By طَلْح in the<br>\
Kur lvi. 28 may be meant the trees called امّ<br>\
غيلان, because they have a blossom of a very<br>\
pleasant odour. (Zj.) [But see below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  طَلْحٌ<br>\
signifies also Banana-trees; syn. شَجَرُ المَوْزِ; and<br>\
is said [by some] to have this meaning in the<br>\
Kur lvi. 28: (Zj, T, TA:) or i. q. مَوْزٌ [which<br>\
some expl. as meaning the trees above-mentioned;<br>\
but others as meaning the fruit of those trees]:<br>\
(Msb, K:) this, however, is said to be unknown<br>\
in the [classical] language. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And i. q.<br>\
طَلْعٌ [generally meaning The spadix of the palmtree; but sometimes the spathe thereof]: (K:) a<br>\
dial. var. of the latter word: (S:) mentioned by<br>\
ISk among words formed by the substitution of<br>\
one letter for another: and this meaning, also, it<br>\
is said [by some] to have in the Kur lvi. 28.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And Remains of turbid water in a<br>\
watering-trough or tank. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  And Having<br>\
the belly void of food. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also طَلِيحٌ.<br>\
طِلْحٌ The tick; syn. قُرَادٌ; (S, A, K;) sometimes applied thereto; (S;) as also ↓ طَلِيحٌ: (S,<br>\
K:) or a large tick. (TA. [See حَمْنَانٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] طِلْحُ مَالٍ (tropical:)  One who keeps to camels, or<br>\
cattle, and to the care of them, like as cleaves the<br>\
طِلْح, i. e. tick: (A:) a manager, tender, or<br>\
superintendent, of camels, or cattle; or a good<br>\
pastor thereof. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And طِلْحُ نِسَآءِ (tropical:)  One<br>\
who follows, or goes after, women (K, TA) much,<br>\
or often. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And طِلْحٌ is also expl. as<br>\
signifying A pastor fatigued, or wearied: (K,<br>\
TA:) and [its pl.] طُلُحٌ, as signifying [simply]<br>\
pastors. (L.) El-Hotei-ah says, after mentioning<br>\
certain camels and their pastors,<br>\
إِذَا نَامَ طِلْحٌ أَشْعَثُ الرَّأْسِ خَلْفَهَا<br>\
هَدَاهُ لَهَا أَنْفَاسُهَا وَزَفِيرُهَا<br>\
When a pastor, dusty and shaggy or matted in<br>\
the hair of the head, sleeps behind them, [and they<br>\
become lost to him,] their breathing and their<br>\
vehement respiration occasioned by the fulness of<br>\
their bellies guides him to them, so that he finds<br>\
them, even if they be distant. (S, * L.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See<br>\
also طَلِيحٌ, in four places.<br>\
طَلَحٌ (thus correctly written, not طَلْحٌ as in<br>\
[some of the copies of] the S, TA) Enjoyment of<br>\
a life of ease and plenty. (S, K.)<br>\
طَلِحٌ an epithet applied to a camel. (A.)<br>\
You say إِبِلٌ طَلِحَةٌ and طَلَاحَى [the latter being<br>\
the pl.] Camels having a complaint (S, A, K) of<br>\
their bellies (S, K) from eating of the trees called<br>\
طَلْح: (S, A, K:) but [the meaning seems to be,<br>\
from eating thereof immoderately, for] Aboo-Sa&#39;eed disapproves of the phrase ابل طلاحى as<br>\
meaning camels that have eaten of the طلح [and<br>\
become disordered thereby, though it appears from<br>\
what is said in art. عضه that camels are sometimes disordered by eating of any of the trees<br>\
called عِضَاه], asserting it to signify camels that<br>\
are fatigued, or wearied; for [he says that] the<br>\
طلح do not disorder camels, but are wholesome<br>\
food for them. (TA.) See also طَلِيحٌ, in two<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  And أَرْضٌ طَلِحَةٌ Land abounding with<br>\
the trees called طَلْح. (K.)<br>\
طَلْحَةٌ n. un. of طَلْحٌ [q. v.]. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  أُمُّ طَلْحَةُ<br>\
The louse. (TA.)<br>\
طَلْحِيَّةٌ meaning A piece of paper is a postclassical word. (K.)<br>\
طَلَاحٌ, as an attribute of a man, (tropical:)  Badness,<br>\
corruptness, or viciousness: (A:) contr. of صَلَاحٌ.<br>\
(S, L, K.)<br>\
طَلِيحٌ, (A, Mgh, Msb,) of the measure فَعِيلٌ in<br>\
the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
Rendered lean, or emaciated, (A, Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
applied to a camel; (A, Msb;) as also ↓ طَلِحٌ,<br>\
(A,) or ↓ طِلْحٌ, (K,) and ↓ طَالِحٌ, so applied,<br>\
by reason of fatigue, or of disease. (A.) Also, (S,<br>\
Mgh, K,) applied to a camel, and ↓ طِلْحٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
the latter, (S, MF,) and the former likewise, (MF,)<br>\
applied to the male and to the female of camels and<br>\
of other animals, (S, MF,) and ↓ طَلْحٌ, (K,) and<br>\
↓ طَلِحٌ, (L, TA,) Fatigued: (S, Mgh, K, TA:)<br>\
and in like manner, applied to a she-camel,<br>\
طَلِيحَةٌ and ↓ طِلْحَةٌ, (K, in the CK طَلْحةٌ,) but<br>\
the forms commonly known of these two epithets<br>\
thus applied are without ة, because each has the<br>\
signification of a pass. part. n., (MF,) and<br>\
↓ طَالِحٌ: (IAar, K:) the pls. are طُلَّحٌ and<br>\
طَلَائِحٌ, (S, K,) [both pls. of طَلِيحٌ,] meaning<br>\
fatigued, or jaded, and rendered lean, by travel,<br>\
(S,) and طَلْحَى, which last is [said by SM to<br>\
be] anomalous, because [he holds that] it has the<br>\
meaning of an act. part. n., [app. on the ground<br>\
that some expl. طَلِيحٌ as syn. with مُعْىٍ and<br>\
تَعِبٌ,] (TA,) and طُلُحٌ is another pl., [app. of<br>\
the second and third and fourth of the sings.<br>\
mentioned above,] signifying fatigued: (L, TA;)<br>\
and أَطْلَاحٌ is pl. [of pauc.] of طِلْحٌ. (S.) One<br>\
says نَاقَةٌ طَلِيحُ أَسْفَارٍ meaning A she-camel jaded,<br>\
and rendered lean, by journeys: (T, S:) and طَلِيحُ<br>\
سَفَرٍ, and سَفَرٍ ↓ طَلْحُ. (IAar, TA.) رَاكِبُ<br>\
النَّاقَةِ طَلِيحَانِ means The rider of the she-camel<br>\
and the she-camel are both fatigued, or jaded:<br>\
(L, K:) for رَاكِبُ النَّاقَةِ وَالنَّاقَةُ طَلِيحَانِ: or for<br>\
رَاكِبُ النَاقَةِ أَحَدُ الطَّليحَيْنِ. (L.)<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
طِلْحٌ.<br>\
إِبِلٌ طِلَاحِيَّةٌ and طُلَاحِيَّةٌ, (S, K,) the latter<br>\
anomalous, (S,) or the latter is a dial. var. of the<br>\
former, which is not a rel. n. from the pl. طِلَاحٌ,<br>\
because, when a rel. n. is formed from a pl., the<br>\
pl. is reduced to its sing. form, unless it is used<br>\
as a name of a particular thing, (from a marginal<br>\
note in copies of the S, [see also Ham pp.<br>\
791-2,]) Camels feeding upon the trees called<br>\
طِلَاح [or طَلْح]. (S, K.)<br>\
طَالِحٌ: see طَلِيحٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, as an<br>\
epithet applied to a man, (tropical:)  Bad, corrupt, or<br>\
vicious; (A, L;) in whom is no good: (L:)<br>\
contr. of صَالِحٌ. (S, L.)<br>\
مُطَلِّحٌ (assumed tropical:)  One who acts wrongfully, unjustly, or<br>\
injuriously, فِى المَالِ [with respect to property, or<br>\
camels, or cattle]. (Az, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, accord. to<br>\
Az, One who breathes hard, or emits the voice<br>\
with a moaning sound, فِى الكَلَامِ [in speaking];<br>\
syn. نَهَّاتٌ [but the first letter in this word is<br>\
written in the L without any diacritical point; so<br>\
that the word may perhaps be بَهَّاتٌ, meaning<br>\
a great, or frequent, calumniator, slanderer, or<br>\
false-accuser: see art. بهت]. (L, TA.)<br>\
