طَعَنَ, (S, Msb, K,) the<br>\

honour, (TA,) inf. n. طَعْنٌ, (S, Msb, K,) and<br>\

or wounded him, with the spear: (MA:) [sometimes طَعَنَهُ means he pierced, stabbed, stuck, or<br>\
gored, him with a spear, &amp;c.; and sometimes, he<br>\
thrust, goaded, or poked, him:] you say, طَعَنَ<br>\
الدَّابَّةَ بِعُودٍ أَوْ نَحْوِهِ [He goaded the beast with a<br>\
stich or the like]. (Mgh and Msb in art. نخس.)<br>\

طَعَنَانًا وَقَوْلَ مَا لَا يُقَالٌ<br>\
[And my father is one in whom hatred is manifest,<br>\
(or, as in the TA, المُظْهِرُ العَدَاوَةَ, he who manifests<br>\
enmity,) except in censuring, and saying what<br>\
should not be said]. (S.) طَعَنَانٌ is of a measure<br>\
of inf. ns. of verbs denoting that in which is<br>\

the whole of the night. (K, TA.) One says,<br>\

طعنت فى أَيَّامِ الحَيْضَةِ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  She entered upon<br>\
the days of the menstruation. (Msb.) ―<br>\

جِنَازَتِهِ means (assumed tropical:)  He died; (Lth and Mgh and TA<br>\
in art. جنز;) [lit. he was thrust into his bier:] or<br>\

6<br>\
تَطَاعَنُوا فِى الحَرْبِ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَطَاعُنٌ,<br>\
(K, TA,) and accord. to the K طعنان, app.<br>\
طَعَنَانٌ, [in the CK with the ع quiescent,] but<br>\
correctly ↓ طِعِنَّانٌ, with two kesrehs and with a<br>\
sheddeh to the ن, which is anomalous; and to<br>\
this the K adds طِعَانٌ, with kesr, [in the CK<br>\
written with fet-h,] but this is the inf. n. of<br>\
↓ طَاعَنُوا, not of تطاعنوا, as also مُطَاعَنَةٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓ اِطَّعَنُوا, (S, K,) of the measure اِفْتَعَلُوا;<br>\
(S;) [They pierced, or thrust, one another in<br>\
war:] Az says that التَّفَاعُلُ and الاِفْتِعَالُ scarcely<br>\
ever signify otherwise than the participation of<br>\
two agents. (TA.)<br>\

a Hudhalee poet in the phrase طَعْنٌ جَوَائِفُ<br>\
[spear-wounds penetrating into the interior of the<br>\
body, or into a vital part]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is also<br>\
an inf. n. of un. in other senses. ―<br>\
-b3-  Golius assigns<br>\
also to this word and to طِعْنَةٌ and طُعْنَةٌ, as from<br>\
the K, the meaning of A woman of evil disposition: but this is evidently a mistake, and<br>\
taken from an art, (next after the present one) in<br>\
the K, in which الطَّعْثَنَةُ, there said to be بِالمُهْمَلَةِ<br>\
وَالمُثَلَّثَةِ, is expl. as meaning “ the woman evil in<br>\
disposition. ”]<br>\
طِعِنَّانٌ an anomalous inf. n. of 6, q. v. (TA.)<br>\

means Wont [to wound, or attack, the reputations of men;] to attack men with blame, censure,<br>\
or reproach, and with backbiting, and the like:<br>\

طِعِّينٌ Skilled in piercing, or thrusting, [with<br>\

or the kind of وَبَأ with which men are smitten by<br>\
the jinn, or genii: (TA voce وَبَأٌ, q. v.:) or a<br>\
mortality in consequence of وَبَأ: (S, Msb:) pl.<br>\
طَوَاعِينُ: (S, Msb, K:) it is a tropical term from<br>\
الطَّعْنُ, because the طَوَاعِين are called by them<br>\
رِمَاحُ الجِنِّ [the spears of the jinn, or genii].<br>\
(Z, TA.)<br>\
مَطْعَنٌ is a noun of place [signifying A place<br>\

(meaning he finds) in him something for which his<br>\
reputation may be wounded, &amp;c.]: pl. مَطَاعِنُ.<br>\

مِطْعَانٌ One who pierces, or thrusts, the enemy<br>\
much; (S, K;) as also ↓ مِطْعَنٌ: (K:) pl. of<br>\
the former مَطَاعِينُ; (S, K;) and of the latter<br>\
مَطَاعِنُ. (K.)<br>\
مَطْعُونٌ Smitten and pierced [&amp;c.; see 1, first<br>\
sentence]; as also ↓ طَعِينٌ: (K:) AZ says, (TA,)<br>\
the pl. [of the latter] is طُعْنٌ, (K, TA,) and not<br>\
طَعْنَى [like قَتْلَى]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  Smitten by<br>\
the طَاعُون [i. e. plague, or pestilence]; (Msb,<br>\
