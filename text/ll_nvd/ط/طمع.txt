طَمِعَ فِيهِ (S, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and بِهِ, (O, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
طَمَعَ, (O, K,) inf. n. طَمَعٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
طَمَاعَةٌ, (S, O, TA,) accord. to all the copies of<br>\
the K [and my copy of the Msb] طَمَاعٌ, but this<br>\
is wrong, (TA,) and طَمَاعِيَةٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,)<br>\
without teshdeed, (S, Msb,) and طَمَاعِيَّةٌ, with<br>\
teshdeed, as in the L, but some disapprove this<br>\
last, (TA,) He coveted it; i. e. desired it vehemently, eagerly, greedily, very greedily, excessively,<br>\
inordinately, or culpably; or he strove to acquire,<br>\
obtain, or attain, it; syn. حَرَصَ عَلَيْهِ: (K, TA:)<br>\
طَمَعٌ signifying the longing, or yearning, for a<br>\
thing; or lusting after it; mostly, for the gratification of animal appetite, without any lawful<br>\
incitement: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and it is mostly<br>\
used in relation to that of which the occurrence,<br>\
or coming to pass, is [deemed] near: but sometimes طَمِعَ فِيهِ signifies he hoped for it. (Msb.)<br>\
[See also طَمَعٌ below. One says also, طَمِعَ فِى<br>\
فُلَانٍ, meaning He eagerly desired, or he hoped,<br>\
to make himself master of, or to overcome, such a<br>\
one: (see an ex. voce خَازِقٌ:) and طَمِعَ فِى فُلَانَةَ<br>\
he eagerly desired, or he hoped, to gain possession<br>\
of, or to win, such a woman; or he lusted after<br>\
her.] ―<br>\
-b2-  طَمُعَ, said of a man, means He became<br>\
very covetous; (صَارَ كَثِيرَ الطَّمَعِ: S, O, K:) [or<br>\
rather how covetous is he! for] it is a verb of<br>\
wonder; the verbs of wonder being of three<br>\
forms, accord. to rule; as in the exs. مَآ أَحْسَنَ<br>\
زَيْدًا and أَسْمِعْ بِهِ and كَبُرَتْ كَلِمَةً; from which<br>\
نِعْمَ and بِئْسَ are anomalous exceptions. (S, O.)<br>\

is said in a trad. of &#39;Omar, الطَّمَعُ فَقْرٌ وَاليَأْسُ غِنًى<br>\
[meaning Coveting, or covetousness, or greed, is a<br>\
cause of poverty, and despair is a cause of freedom from want]. (TA.) And one says, الطَّمَعُ<br>\
طَبَعٌ [Coveting, or covetousness, or greed, is a cause<br>\
of disgrace, or dishonour]. (TA. See أَطْمَعُ.)<br>\
[See also an ex. in a verse cited voce طَبَعٌ. And<br>\

مِنْ قَالِبِ الصَّخْرَةِ [More covetous than the turnerover of the great mass of stone] is a prov., of<br>\
which the origin was this: a man of Ma&#39;add saw<br>\
a stone in the land of El-Yemen, on which was<br>\
inscribed, أَقْلِبْنِى أَنْفَعْكَ [“ Turn me over, I will<br>\
benefit thee ”]: and he exercised his skill in<br>\
turning it over, and found [inscribed] on the<br>\
other side, يَهْدِى إِلَى طَبَعٍ ↓ رُبَّ طَمَعٍ [Many a<br>\
coveting leads to disgrace]: and he ceased not to<br>\
beat with his head the great mass of stone, by<br>\
reason of regret, until his brains issued and he<br>\
died. (Meyd.)<br>\
