طَلَبَهُ, (S, A, O, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
طَلُبَ, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
طَلَبٌ (S, A, MA, O, Msb, K &amp;c.) and مَطْلَبٌ<br>\
(A, MA, Msb) and طِلَابٌ and طِلَابَةٌ (A, MA)<br>\
and طَلِبَةٌ (MA) and تَطْلَابٌ [which is of a<br>\
measure denoting intensiveness]; (TA;) and<br>\
↓ اِطَّلَبَهُ; (S, A, O, Msb, K;) and ↓ تطلّبهُ; (A,<br>\
K;) [but see this last below;] He sought it,<br>\
desired it, demanded it, or asked for it; (MA;)<br>\
[he pursued it, pursued after it, or prosecuted it;]<br>\
he sought, desired, or endeavoured, to find it and<br>\
to get or take it: (A, K, TA:) and طَلَبَ is also<br>\
expl. as signifying اتبع [i. e. أَتْبَعَ he followed in<br>\
pursuit, &amp;c.]. (TA.) One says, اُطْلُبْ لِى شَيْئًا<br>\
Seek thou, &amp;c., for me, a thing. (Lh, TA.) And<br>\
طَلَبَهُ مِنْهُ and إِلَيْهِ, inf. n. as above, He sought it,<br>\
desired it, demanded it, or asked for it, of him.<br>\
(MA.) And طَلَبَ إِلَىَّ means رَغِبَ [i. e. He<br>\
petitioned me, or made petition to me, &amp;c.]: (K,<br>\
TA:) or طَلَبَ إِلَيْهِ means سَأَلَهُ [he asked him]:<br>\
or [it means] طَلَبَهُ رَاغِبًا إِلَيْهِ [he sought him,<br>\
petitioning him]; for it is generally held that<br>\
طَلَبَ is not trans. by means of a prep., therefore<br>\
they explain the like of this phrase as implicative.<br>\
(MF, TA.) See also 4, in two places: and see 5.<br>\
You say also, طَلَبَهُ بِحَقٍّ, meaning طَالَبَهُ, q. v.<br>\
(K.) And طَلَبَ بِثَأْرِهِ and بِذَحْلِهِ [He sought to<br>\
obtain his blood-revenge, or retaliation; and in<br>\
like manner, طَلَبَ بِدَمِهِ]. (S and Msb in art.<br>\
ذحل.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says also, السِّرَاجُ يَطْلُبُ<br>\
أَنْ يَنْطَفِئَ (tropical:)  [The lamp, or lighted wick, is near,<br>\
or about, to become extinguished]; like as one<br>\
says, جِدَارٌ يُرِيدُ أَنْ يَنْقَضَّ. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  طَلِبَ, aor.<br>\
طَلَبَ,<br>\
(O, K,) inf. n. طَلَبٌ, (TK,) He, or it, [accord.<br>\
to the TK said of a man,] was, or became, distant,<br>\
or remote. (O, K. [See also 4.])<br>\
2<br>\
طَلَّبَ see 5.<br>\
3<br>\
طالبهُ, inf. n. مُطَالَبَةٌ and طِلَابٌ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
He sought or demanded of him a thing [as being<br>\
due to him; i. e. he sued or prosecuted him for<br>\
it]; (Msb;) i. q. بِحَقٍّ ↓ طَلَبَهُ [he sought or<br>\
demanded of him, &amp;c., a right, or due]: (K:)<br>\
and you say, طالبهُ بِحَقٍّ لَهُ عَلَيْهِ [he sought or<br>\
demanded of him, &amp;c., a thing due to him on his<br>\
part]. (A.) مُطَالَبَةٌ is used in relation to a real<br>\
thing: [but it does not necessarily imply the<br>\
justice of the act:] one says, طالب زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا<br>\
بِالدَّرَاهِمِ [Zeyd sought or demanded of &#39;Amr, or<br>\
sued or prosecuted him for, the money]. (Kull<br>\
p. 349.) And طالبهُ بِالدَّيْنِ He sought or demanded of him [&amp;c.] the debt. (MA.) And<br>\
طالبهُ بِكَذَا, (S, O,) inf. n. مُطَالَبَةٌ, (S,) [He<br>\
sought or demanded of him, &amp;c., such a thing;<br>\
or he prosecuted him for such a thing, as, for<br>\
instance, blood, or mutilation, or a wound: see<br>\
exs. voce خَبْلٌ.]<br>\
4<br>\
اطلبهُ He performed, or accomplished, for<br>\
him, (S, A, O, Msb, TA,) that which he sought,<br>\
or demanded, (S, A, * O, Msb,) or the object of<br>\
his want: (TA:) or he gave him that which he<br>\
sought, or demanded. (K.) A man said to the<br>\
Prophet, إِلَىَّ طَلِبَةً فَإِنِّى أُحِبُّ أَنْ أُطْلِبَكَهَا ↓ اُطْلُبْ<br>\
i. e. [Ask thou of me] an object of want, [for I<br>\
love] to perform it, or accomplish it, for thee.<br>\
(TA.) And one says, إِلَىَّ فَأَطْلَبْتُهُ ↓ طَلَبَ i. e.<br>\
[He asked of me a thing] and I performed, or<br>\
accomplished, for him that which he sought, or<br>\
demanded. (TA.) And اطلبهُ الشَّىْءَ He aided<br>\
him, or helped him, to seek the thing. (TA.)<br>\
And أَطْلِبْنِى Aid thou me to seek. (Lh, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also He, or it, (said of a man, Msb, and<br>\
of poverty, A,) necessitated his seeking, or demanding. (S, A, O, Msb, K.) Thus it has two<br>\
contr. significations. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And hence,<br>\
(S, O,) أَطْلَبَ said of water, and of pasture, or<br>\
herbage, (S, A, O,) &amp;c., (S, O,) It was distant,<br>\
or remote, (S, A, O,) so as to be not attainable<br>\
but by seeking, (S, O,) or so that it was sought. (A.)<br>\
5<br>\
تطلّبهُ He sought it, or demanded it, repeatedly, or time after time: (S, O:) [he made<br>\
repeated, or successive, endeavours to obtain it,<br>\
or to attain it: he prosecuted a search after it:]<br>\
or he sought it diligently, studiously, sedulously,<br>\
or earnestly; syn. اِبْتَغَاهُ: (Msb:) or he sought,<br>\
desired, or endeavoured, leisurely, to find it and<br>\
to get or take it; (O, TA;) and (TA) so ↓ طلّبهُ,<br>\
inf. n. تَطْلِيبٌ; (K, TA;) and ↓ طَلَبَهُ; (TA;)<br>\
from [various] places. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1,<br>\
first sentence.<br>\
7<br>\
انطلب لَهُ is quasi-pass. of طَلَبَهُ, and means<br>\
It (an action [&amp;c.]) was, or became, suitable to<br>\
him; or fit, meet, or proper, for him: [as though<br>\
it were sought, or desired, or desirable:] but they<br>\
have been content to use اِنْبَغَى in the place of<br>\
this verb. (Zj, TA in art. بغى. [يَنْبَغِى, in the<br>\
Kur xix. 93, is expl. by يَنْطَلِبُ in the Ksh and<br>\
in the Expos. of Bd.])<br>\

(O,) or each, the latter mentioned by Lh, (TA,)<br>\
means she is the object of quest, or desire, and the<br>\
object of love, of such a one. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And it<br>\
