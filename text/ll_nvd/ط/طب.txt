طَبَّ, aor.<br>\
طَبُ3َ, (O, Msb, K, TA,) agreeably<br>\
with analogy in the case of a trans. reduplicative<br>\
verb [like this], (TA,) and<br>\
طَبِ3َ, (K, TA,) which is<br>\
irregular, (TA,) inf. n. طَبٌّ (O, * Msb, K, * TA)<br>\
[and app. طِبٌّ and طُبٌّ also accord. to the O<br>\
and K, but, accord. to the Msb, طِبٌّ is the subst.<br>\
from this verb, and app. طُبٌّ is likewise a simple<br>\
subst.], He treated medically, therapeutically, or<br>\
curatively, (O, * Msb, K, *) another person (O,<br>\
Msb) [or the body, and in like manner the soul:<br>\
see طِبٌّ, below]. ―<br>\
-b2-  And طَبيْتَ, with kesr, (S,<br>\
O, K,) and طَبَبْتَ, with fet-h, (O, K,) [third pers.<br>\
of each طَبَّ, and, accord. to analogy, the aor. of<br>\
the former is<br>\
طَبَ3َ, and of the latter<br>\
طَبِ3َ, but from what<br>\
follows it seems probable that one says also طَبُبْتَ<br>\
in the same sense, aor.<br>\
طَبُ3َ, unless طَبَبْتَ have تَطُتُّ<br>\
as an irreg. aor.,] Thou wast, or becamest a<br>\
طَبِيت [or physician], not having been such. (S,<br>\
O, K.) One says, إِنْ كُنْتَ ذَا طُبٍّ فَطُبَّ لِعَيْنَيْكَ,<br>\
(S, O, and so in copies of the K,) or لِعَيْنِكَ, (so<br>\
in other copies of the K,) or لِنَفْسِكَ, (ISk, TA,)<br>\
and ذا طَبٍّ, and ذا طِبٍّ, (S, K,) and فَطَبَّ, and<br>\
فَطِبَّ; (K;) [i. e. If thou be a possessor of the<br>\
art, or science, of physic, be a physician to thine<br>\
eyes, or thine eye, or thyself;] meaning, begin by<br>\
rectifying thyself. (ISk, TA. [See also Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Arab. Prov. ii. 902.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence] طَبَّ<br>\
signifies also (assumed tropical:)  He acted with skill, or expertness:<br>\
[and in this sense likewise the second pers. is<br>\
probably طَبِبْتَ and طَبَبْتَ and طَبُبْتَ, of which<br>\
last the inf. n. is app. طَبَابَةٌ, occurring in one of<br>\
the phrases here following:] so in the saying,<br>\
اِصْنَعْهُ صَنْعَةَ مَنْ طَبَّ لِمَنْ حَبَّ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Do thou it<br>\
in the manner of him who acts with skill, or<br>\
expertness, for him whom he loves: a prov.,<br>\
relating to the accomplishing an object of want<br>\
skilfully and well. (El-Ahmar, TA. [See also<br>\
Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i. 717.]) One says also,<br>\
اِعْمَلْ فِى هٰذَا عَمَلَ مَنْ طَبَّ لِمَنْ حَبَّ (assumed tropical:)  [Do<br>\
thou, in this, the deed of him who acts with skill,<br>\
or expertness, for him whom he loves]. (M, Msb, *<br>\
TA.) And مَنْ حَبَّ طَبَّ, (Meyd,) or مَنْ أَحَبَّ<br>\
طَبَّ, (K,) (assumed tropical:)  He who loves is skilful, or intelligent, and exercises art, or ingenuity, for him<br>\
whom he loves: (Meyd:) or (assumed tropical:)  he who loves<br>\
executes affairs with deliberateness and gentleness.<br>\
(K.) [That one says طَبُبْتَ, as well as طَبِبْتَ<br>\
and طَبَبْتَ, seems to be indicated by the fact that<br>\
↓ طَبَابَةٌ, as an inf. n., is thus written, in a copy of<br>\
the KL in my possession, and expl. as meaning<br>\
The medical art: Golius, however, appears to<br>\
have found it written, in a copy of the same<br>\
work, ↓ طِبَابَةٌ, which is agreeable with analogy<br>\
as inf. n. of a verb of the measure فَعَلَ significant<br>\
of an art, and is probably correct: Freytag<br>\
mentions the pl. طَبَائِبُ as signifying medical<br>\
arts, on the authority of the Deewán of the<br>\
Hudhalees.] ―<br>\
-b4-  طَبَّهُ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He enchanted him, or fascinated him: (O:) and طُبَّ<br>\
(tropical:)  he (a man, S, A) was enchanted, or fascinated.<br>\
(S, A, O. [See also طِبٌّ, below.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  طَبَّ السِّقَآءَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
طَبُ3َ, (S, TA,) inf. n. طَبٌّ; (K, TA;) and<br>\
↓ طبّبهُ, with teshdeed to denote muchness, (S,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. تطْبِيبٌ; (K, TA;) He covered the<br>\
seams of the water-skin, or milk-skin, with a<br>\
طِبَابَة [q. v.]: (S, K, * TA:) and طَبَّ الخُرَزَ he<br>\
covered the seams with a طِبَابَة: (TA) [and]<br>\
المَزَادَة ↓ طَبَّبَتِ she (a girl, or young woman,)<br>\
put [or sewed] a piece of skin called ↓ طِبَابٌ and<br>\
↓ طِبَابَةٌ, upon the place of junction [of each] of the<br>\
two extremities of the loop-shaped handles of the<br>\
مزادة [or leathern water-bag]; as though she<br>\
rectified the مزادة thereby. (A.)<br>\
2<br>\
طَبَّ3َ see the last sentence above, in two places.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  تَطْبِيبٌ also signifies The inserting a بَنِيقَة [or<br>\
gore] for the purpose of widening دِيبَاج [or silk<br>\
brocade]: (K, TA:) or, as in the A, one says of<br>\
a tailor, طبّبِ الثَّوْبَ, meaning he added, in the<br>\
garment, a بَنِيقَة [or gore], in order that it might<br>\
become [more] wide. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The hanging<br>\
a سِقَآء [or milk-skin] (S, K, TA) to a pole (عَمُود,<br>\
S, this is the right word, not عُود [as in copies of<br>\
the K], TA) of the tent, (S,) and then agitating<br>\
it to produce the butter: (S, K, TA:) but Az<br>\
says, I have not heard تطبيب explained in this<br>\
sense except on the authority of Lth, and I think<br>\
that it is تطنيب. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
مُطَابَّةٌ signifies (tropical:)  The seeking, or labouring,<br>\
to find the means of accomplishment [of an affair,<br>\
like as the physician seeks to find the means of<br>\
curing a disease]; syn. مُدَاوَرَةٌ. (K, TA.) One<br>\
says, أَنَا أُطَابُّ هٰذَا الأَمْرَ مُنْذُ حِينٍ كَىْ أَبْلُغَهُ (tropical:)  [I<br>\
have been seeking, or labouring, to find the means<br>\
of accomplishing this affair, that I might attain<br>\
to it]. (A, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
مَا أَطَبَّهُمْ How [knowing, or] skilful, or<br>\
expert, are they! (Meyd, in explaining a prov.<br>\
cited below, voce طَبٌّ.)<br>\
5<br>\
تطبّب He applied himself to the science of<br>\
physic: (TA:) [or he applied himself to the<br>\
science of physic but did not know it well: (see<br>\
the part. n., below:)] or he practised physic:<br>\
and he professed physic. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And تطبّب لَهُ<br>\
He inquired of [or consulted] the physicians for<br>\
him. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استطبّ لِوَجَعِهِ He asked, or sought, a<br>\
medical prescription for his pain, or disease. (S,<br>\
A, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And جَآءَ يَسْتَطِبُّ لإِبِلِهِ (tropical:)  He<br>\
came asking, or seeking, for his she-camels, a<br>\
gentle stallion, that would not injure them. (A.)<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
طَبْطَبَ, (Lth, K, TA,) inf. n. طَبْطَبَةٌ,<br>\
(Lth, TA,) said of a valley, or water-course,<br>\
(Lth, K, TA,) It flowed with water so that one<br>\
heard it to make a sound like طَبْ طَبْ: (Lth,<br>\
TA:) or it made a sound (K, TA) with the<br>\
water. (TA.) طَبْطَبَةٌ signifies The sounding of<br>\
water (IAar, S, K, TA) when in a state of commotion and collision, (IAar, TA,) and of the like,<br>\
(S, TA,) and of the dashing of a torrent. (K.)<br>\
And ↓ تَطَبْطَبَ It made a sound, or noise, [like<br>\
طَبْ طَبْ,] said of water and the like, (S,) and<br>\
of a woman&#39;s breast: (TA:) a poet says,<br>\
إِذَا طَحَنَتْ دُرْنِيَّةٌ لِعِيَالِهَا<br>\
تَطَبْطَبَ ثَدْيَاهَا فَطَارَ طَحِينُهَا<br>\
[When a woman of Durnà grinds for her family,<br>\
her breasts make a sound by their collision, and<br>\
her flour flies away]. (S, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  طَبْطَبَ المَآءَ He<br>\
put the water into a state of commotion. (TA.)<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَطَبْطَبَ: see the next preceding<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
طَبٌّ: see طِبٌّ.<br>\
-A2-  It is also an inf. n. used as<br>\
an epithet: see طَبِيبٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, (S, A,<br>\
Msb, K,) as such, i. e. an inf. n. used as an<br>\
epithet, or by original application, but the former<br>\
is app. the case, and some have mentioned likewise ↓ طبٌّ and ↓ طُبٌّ, (MF, TA,) (tropical:)  Knowing,<br>\
or possessing knowledge, (S, A, Msb, TA,) respecting a thing, or of a thing; (A, Msb, TA;)<br>\
and so ↓ طَبِيبٌ: (TA:) and (TA) (assumed tropical:)  skilful, or<br>\
expert; (T, K;) as also ↓ طَبِيبٌ: (T, S, K:) and<br>\
(tropical:)  gentle; (Nh, TA;) and so too ↓ طَبِيبٌ. (TA.)<br>\
One says, فُلَانٌ طَبٌّ بِكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is knowing<br>\
with regard to, or is one possessing knowledge of,<br>\
such a thing. (TA.) And القَوْمُ طَبُّونَ, or, as<br>\
some relate it, ↓ القَوْمُ مَا أَطَبُّونَ, is a prov.: the<br>\
former means (assumed tropical:)  The people, or party, are knowing,<br>\
or skilful, or expert: and [Meyd says,] I know<br>\
not any way in which the latter is explainable<br>\
unless ↓ أَطَبُّ be syn. with طَبٌّ, like أَخْشَنُ and<br>\
خَشِنٌ, &amp;c., and ما a connective. (Meyd.) To a<br>\
man who offered to cure the [so-called] seal, or<br>\
stamp, of the prophetic office between the Prophet&#39;s shoulder-blades, asserting himself to be a<br>\
طَبِيب [or physician], the Prophet replied, ↓ طَبِيبُهَا<br>\
الَّذِّى خَلَقَهَا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He who has knowledge<br>\
respecting it is He who created it. (TA.) And<br>\
El-Marrár El-Fak&#39;asee says,<br>\
تَدِينُ لِمَزْرُورٍ إِلَى جَنْبِ حَلْقَةٍ<br>\
↓ مِنَ الشِّبْهِ سَوَّاهَا بِرِفْقٍ طَبِيبُهَا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [She obeys a plaited nose-rein attached to the<br>\
side of a ring of brass, the skilful maker of which<br>\
has fashioned it with gentleness]: (S, L:) i. e. the<br>\
she-camel of which he speaks obeys her rein that<br>\
is tied to her nose-ring of brass. (L.) [Hence,]<br>\
فَحْلٌ طَبٌّ (assumed tropical:)  A stallion [camel] expert in covering,<br>\
(S, Msb, K, TA,) as also ↓ طَبِيبٌ; (Msb;) that<br>\
knows the she-camel that is pregnant from her<br>\
that is not, and her that desires the stallion from<br>\
her that is covered without desire, and the motion<br>\
of the fœtus in the womb, &amp;c.: (TA:) or (tropical:)  that<br>\
is gentle, and does not injure the female that he<br>\
covers. (A, TA.) And بَعِيرٌ طَبٌّ (tropical:)  A camel that<br>\
is mindful, or careful, as to the place of his foot,<br>\
(A, K, TA,) where to tread with it: or that does<br>\
not place his foot save where he sees. (TA.)<br>\
طُبٌّ: see the next paragraph:<br>\
-A2-  and see also<br>\
طَبٌّ.<br>\
طِبٌّ (S, A, O, Msb, K) and ↓ طَبٌّ and ↓ طُبٌّ<br>\
(S, A, O, K,) Medical, therapeutical, or curative,<br>\
treatment, (A, * O, * Msb, K, *) of the body, [i. e.<br>\
the physicking thereof,] (A, K,) and likewise of<br>\
the soul. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And Knowledge]. قَرُبَ طِبٌّ<br>\
[Knowledge is near], or, as some relate it, قَرُبَ<br>\
طِبًّا, (Meyd, O, K, TA,) with the noun in the<br>\
accus. case, as a specificative, (TA,) like the<br>\
phrase نِعْمَ رَجُلًا, (Meyd, O, TA,) is a prove.:<br>\
originally said by a woman to a man who asked<br>\
her an indecent question which he was himself<br>\
about to resolve: (Meyd, O, K, TA:) it is like<br>\
the saying, أَنْتَ عَلَى المُجَرَّبِ [q. v.]: (Meyd,<br>\
TA:) and is related on the authority of Ibn-Háni. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Skill, or expertness. (T,<br>\
ISd, Meyd, TA.) This is said in the T to be<br>\
the primary signification. (TA. [But see طَبِيبٌ.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  Gentleness; gentle treatment or conduct.<br>\
(K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (tropical:)  Enchantment, or fascination:<br>\
(S, O, K, TA: but only طِبٌّ is mentioned in this<br>\
sense in the S and O:) used in this sense as<br>\
ominating cure. (AO, O, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And طِبٌّ<br>\
signifies also Desire, or appetence; syn. شَهْوَةٌ:<br>\
and will, or wish; syn. إِرَادَةٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And<br>\
(tropical:)  State, condition, or case; syn. شَأْنٌ, (K, TA,)<br>\
and دَأْبٌ: (A, TA:) [or by the latter of these<br>\
two words may be meant what here follows:]<br>\
custom, habit, or wont. (S, K, TA.) One says,<br>\
مَاذَاكَ بِطِبِّى (tropical:)  That is not my custom, habit, or<br>\
wont. (S, A, TA.) [See also another ex., in a<br>\
verse (added here in the S and TA) which I have<br>\
cited voce إِنْ, page 107, col. iii.]<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
طَبٌّ.<br>\
طُبَّةٌ: see طِبَابَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
طِبَّةٌ An oblong piece, or portion, of a garment,<br>\
or of a piece of cloth, (S, A, TA,) as also ↓ طَبِيبَةٌ;<br>\
(A;) and likewise of skin: or a square piece of<br>\
the latter: and a round piece in a مَزَادَة and a<br>\
سُفْرَة and the like: (TA:) pl. طِبَبٌ: (S:) and,<br>\
as also ↓ طِبَابَةٌ, (As, S, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  a streak in sand<br>\
and clouds, (As, TA,) or a streak of sand or<br>\
clouds: (S:) or طِبَّةٌ and ↓ طِبَابَةٌ and ↓ طَبِيبَةٌ<br>\
signify an oblong piece, or portion, of a garment<br>\
or piece of cloth, and of skin, and (assumed tropical:)  of land or<br>\
ground, and (assumed tropical:) of clouds: (K:) or, all three<br>\
words, a long strip of a garment or piece of<br>\
cloth, and of skin, and (assumed tropical:)  of sand, and (assumed tropical:)  of clouds:<br>\
(TA:) and (assumed tropical:)  a long and narrow tract of land<br>\
abounding with plants or herbage: (AHn, TA;<br>\
and A in explanation of the first word:) pl. [of<br>\
the first] طِبَبٌ and [of the same, or of the third,<br>\
or a coll. gen. n. of which the second word is<br>\
the n. un.,] ↓ طِبَابٌ. (K.) And sometimes طِبَّةٌ<br>\
is applied to The piece that is sewed upon the edge<br>\
of the leathern bucket and upon that of the سُفْرَة:<br>\
and the pl. is طِبَبٌ and ↓ طِبَابٌ. (M, TA.) طِبَبُ<br>\
شُعَاعِ الشَّمْسِ (As, S, TA) and ↓ الطِّبَابُ, (As, TA,)<br>\
or طِبَبُ الشَّمْسِ and ↓ طِبَابُهَا, (A, TA,) signify<br>\
(tropical:)  The streaks that are seen in the rays, or beams,<br>\
of the sun when it rises. (As, S, A, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also (tropical:)  i. q. نَاحِيَةٌ [i. e. A side; or a region,<br>\
quarter, or tract; &amp;c.]: (so in a copy of the<br>\
A:) or i. q. نَاصِيَةٌ [i. e. a forelock; &amp;c.]. (So<br>\
in the TA.) [One of these two explanations is<br>\
app. a mistranscription for the other.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
one says, إِنَّكَ لَتَلْقَى فُلَانًا عَلَى طِبَبٍ مُخْتَلِفَةٍ,<br>\
meaning, عَلَى أَلْوَانٍ (tropical:)  [i. e. Verily thou wilt find<br>\
such a one to be of various moods, dispositions, or<br>\
characters]. (A, TA.)<br>\
طِبَابٌ [like عِلَاجٌ] A thing that is used for<br>\
medical, or curative, treatment: so in the saying,<br>\
ذَا طِبَابُ هٰذِهِ العِلَّةِ [This, or that, is what is used<br>\
for the medical, or curative, treatment of this<br>\
disease]. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also طِبَّةٌ, latter half,<br>\
in four places. And see طِبَابَةٌ, in five places:<br>\
and 1, last sentence.<br>\
طَبِيبٌ (S, Msb, K, TA) and ↓ طَبٌّ (Msb, TA)<br>\
[A physician;] one skilled in الطِّبّ [i. e. medical,<br>\
therapeutical, or curative, treatment]; (S, TA;)<br>\
or one who practises medical, therapeutical, or<br>\
curative, treatment; (Msb;) and ↓ مُتَطَبِّبٌ signifies [likewise one who practises physic: and a<br>\
professor of physic: (see its verb:) or] one who<br>\
applies himself to the science of physic: (S, K,<br>\
TA:) or one who applies himself to that science<br>\
but does not know it well: (Nh, TA:) it has<br>\
been said that the طَبِيب is so called from the<br>\
same epithet as signifying “ skilful, or expert; ”<br>\
but this is not a valid assertion: (TA:) the pl.<br>\
(of pauc., S) is أَطِبَّةٌ (S, K) and (of mult., S)<br>\
أَطِبَّآءُ. (S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The first of these words<br>\
(طبيب) occurs in a trad. as meaning (tropical:)  A judge;<br>\
being metonymically thus used, because the office<br>\
of him who judges between litigants is like that of<br>\
the طبيب who cures diseases of the body. (TA.)<br>\
[And hence, طَبِيبُ العَرَبِ: see فَقِيهُ العَرَبِ, in art.<br>\
فقه.] See also طَبٌّ, in six places.<br>\
طَبَابَةٌ: see 1, latter half.<br>\
طِبَابَةٌ: see 1, latter half.<br>\
-A2-  Also A piece of<br>\
skin with which the seams of a سِقَآء are covered,<br>\
extending across, [so I render مُعْتَرِضَةٌ, app. meaning from side to side, for one edge of the skin<br>\
beneath overlaps the other,] like the finger [in<br>\
breadth], doubled [but see what is said below on<br>\
the authority of AZ] over the place of the sewing:<br>\
pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.] ↓ طِبَابٌ: (As, S, TA:)<br>\
or that which is put over the place where the two<br>\
edges of the skin meet, when it is sewed, in the<br>\
lower part of the قِرْبَة and of the سِقَآء and of the<br>\
إِدَاوَة: so says As: or, as also ↓ طِبَابٌ, the piece of<br>\
skin that is put over the two edges of the skin, in<br>\
these things, when it is laid flat and then sewed,<br>\
without being doubled: (TA:) accord. to AZ,<br>\
when the [piece of] skin, in the lower parts of<br>\
these things, is doubled, and then sewed, it is<br>\
called عِرَاقٌ; and when it is laid flat and then<br>\
sewed, without being doubled, it is called<br>\
↓ طِبَابٌ: (TA; and the like is said in the S in<br>\
art. عرق:) or طِبَابَةٌ and عِرَاقٌ both signify, accord.<br>\
to As, a piece of skin with which the punctures<br>\
of the seams are covered: (S in art. عرق:) or a<br>\
طِبَابَة is a wide strip of skin, in which is the<br>\
sewing: and the pl. [or coll. gen. n.] is ↓ طِبَابٌ:<br>\
(M, TA:) or, accord. to the K, a strip of skin<br>\
that is in the lower part of a قِرْبَة, between the two<br>\
seams; as also ↓ طُبَّةٌ: but in this explanation,<br>\
its author has confounded the words of Lth, who<br>\
says that طِبَابَةٌ signifies the strip of the skin that<br>\
is between the two seams; and ↓ طُبَّةٌ, the strip of<br>\
skin that is in the lower part of the قِرْبَة, and that<br>\
contracts the seams [so I render يقارب الخرز,<br>\
but the meaning of this phrase is not, to me,<br>\
clear]. (TA.) See also 1, last sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
see طِبَّةٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, and ↓ طِبَابٌ,<br>\
(K, TA, in the CK طَباب and طَبابة,) [or the<br>\
latter is a coll. gen. n.,] (assumed tropical:)  A streak, or narrow<br>\
elongated tract, of the sky: (K, TA:) [and app.<br>\
any portion of the sky not of large extent:] an<br>\
ex. of the latter word occurs in a verse cited voce<br>\
مَرَاكِدُ: and in another verse, a man in a prison<br>\
is described as seeing only a طِبَابَة of the sky like<br>\
a shield; i. e. a round portion thereof. (Az, TA.)<br>\
طَبِيبَةٌ, see طِبَّةٌ, in two places.<br>\
طِبِّىٌّ Medical, therapeutical, or curative; of,<br>\
or relating to, medical, therapeutical, or curative,<br>\
treatment. (Msb.)<br>\
طَبْطَبَةٌ A certain broad thing, one part of which<br>\
is struck with another part thereof. (TA.)<br>\
طَبْطَبِيَّةٌ A [kind of whip, or scourge, such as is<br>\
called] دِرَّة [q. v.]: (K, TA:) because the sound<br>\
that is made by its fall is like طَبْ طَبْ. (TA.)<br>\
طَبْطَابٌ A certain bird, or flying thing, (طَائِرٌ,)<br>\
having large ears. (K.)<br>\
طَبْطَابَةٌ, or طِبْطَابَةٌ, (accord. to different copies<br>\
of the K,) A broad piece of wood, with which one<br>\
plays with the ball, (K, TA,) or with which the<br>\
horseman plays with the ball. (T, TA.)<br>\
الطَّبَاطِبُ The عَجَم [i. e. Persians, or<br>\
foreigners]. (L, TA.)<br>\
أَطَبُّ; and its pl., أَطَبُّونَ: see طَبٌّ.<br>\
