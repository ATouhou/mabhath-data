طَوڤفَ The inf. n. طَوَافٌ primarily signifies, accord.<br>\
to Er-Rághib, The act of going, or walking, in an<br>\
absolute sense: or the going, or walking, around,<br>\

طُفْتُ بِهِ عَلَى البَيْتِ [I went round the House of<br>\
God, i. e. the Kaabeh, with him; or] I made<br>\
him to go round, or to circuit, or compass, the<br>\
House. (Msb. [The vulgar in the present day<br>\
say ↓ طَوَّفْتُهُ: and they apply the appellation<br>\
↓ مُطَوِّف to One who makes the circuits round the<br>\
Kaabeh with a pilgrim, and serves to conduct him<br>\
round about to the other sacred objects, or places.])<br>\
You say also, طاف فِى البِلَادِ, inf. n. طَوْفٌ and<br>\
تَطْوَافٌ, He journeyed [or journeyed round about]<br>\
in the countries, or tracts of country; and so [or<br>\
as meaning he did so much or often] ↓ طوّف, inf. n.<br>\
تَطْوِيفٌ and تَطْوَافٌ. (TA. [In one place in the<br>\
TA, the latter inf. n. is said to be with kesr, so<br>\
that it is like تِبْيَانٌ; but see this latter, which is<br>\
very extr.: see also تِطْوَافٌ below.]) ↓ لَأَطُوفَنَّ<br>\
طَوْفَهُ means the same as لَأَسْعَرَنَّ سَعْرَهُ [app. I will<br>\

thereon upon the water and for carriage thereon<br>\
(S, O, K, TA) of wheat or other provisions<br>\
and of men, and for the crossing [of rivers]<br>\
thereon: (TA:) i. q. رَمَثٌ: and sometimes it is of<br>\
wood, or timber: (S, O:) accord. to Az, a thing<br>\
upon which large rivers are crossed, made of canes<br>\
and of pieces of wood bound together, one upon<br>\
another, and then bound round with ropes of the<br>\
fibres or leaves of the palm-tree so as to be secure<br>\
from its becoming unbound; after which it is<br>\
used for embarking thereon and crossing, and<br>\
sometimes it is laden with a load proportionate to<br>\
its strength and its thickness: and it is also called<br>\
عَامَةٌ, without teshdeed to the م: (TA:) pl.<br>\
أَطْوَافٌ. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\

(Msb:) what Er-Rághib says respecting it indicates that this is metonymical. (TA.)<br>\
أَخَذَهُ بِطُوفِ رَقَبَتِهِ and رقبته ↓ بِطَافِ i. q. بِصُوفِ<br>\
رقبته (S, K) and بِصَافِهَا. (K.)<br>\
طُوفَانٌ An overpowering rain: and overpowering water, [a meaning erroneously assigned in the<br>\
CK to طَوَّاف instead of طُوفَان,] that covers [or<br>\
overwhelms] everything; (S, K, TA;) in the<br>\
common conventional acceptation, water abounding to the utmost degree; [i. e. a flood, or deluge;]<br>\
such as befell the people of Noah; (TA;) or<br>\
طُوفَانُ المَآءِ signifies the water that covers [or overwhelms] everything: (Msb:) and a drowning<br>\
torrent: (K:) and (assumed tropical:)  much of anything, [like as<br>\
we say a flood of anything,] such as includes the<br>\

generally, prevailing: and (assumed tropical:)  quick [and extensive]<br>\
slaughter: (K:) and (assumed tropical:)  any accident [or evil<br>\

using the phrase طُوفَانُ الظَّلَامِ; (Kh, S;) by<br>\
which he means (assumed tropical:)  the intensity of the darkness of<br>\
the night: (TA:) طُوفَانٌ is said to be a pl. [or<br>\
coll. gen. n.]; (Msb, TA;) and its sing. [or<br>\
n. un.] is طُوفَانَةٌ, (S, Msb, K, TA,) accord. to<br>\
analogy: (S:) thus says Akh: (S, TA:) or it is<br>\
an inf. n., like رُجْحَانٌ and نُقْصَانٌ; and is from<br>\
طَافَ, aor. يَطُوفُ: (Msb, TA:) thus says Abu-l-<br>\
&#39;Abbás; and he says that there is no need of<br>\
seeking for it a sing.: some say that it is of the<br>\
measure فُلْعَانٌ, from طَفَا المَآءُ, aor. يَطْفُو, meaning<br>\
“ the water rose,” or “ became high; ” the ل<br>\
being transposed to the place of the ع; but this is<br>\
strange. (TA.)<br>\
طَوَافٌ [is an inf. n. of 1, q. v., sometimes used<br>\
as a simple subst., and] has for its pl. أَطْوَافٌ<br>\
[which is regularly pl. of طَوْفٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
طَوَّافٌ; and its fem., with ة: see طَافٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  The<br>\
former signifies also A servant who serves one<br>\
with gentleness and carefulness: (K, TA:) pl.<br>\
طَوَّافُونَ: so says AHeyth: IDrd explains the<br>\
pl. as meaning servants, and male slaves. (TA.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., respecting the she-cat, that<br>\
it is not unclean, but is مِنَ الطَّوَّافِينَ عَلَيْكُمْ, or<br>\
الطَّوَّافَاتِ; [i. e. of those that go round about<br>\
waiting upon you;] she being thus put it. the<br>\
predicament of the slaves: whence the saying of<br>\
En-Nakha&#39;ee, that the she-cat is like some of the<br>\
people of the house, or tent. (TA.) [In the<br>\
CK, a meaning belonging to طُوفَان is erroneously<br>\
assigned to طَوَّاف.]<br>\
-A2-  Also A maker of the طَوْف<br>\
that is composed of [inflated] water-skins [&amp;c.]<br>\
upon which one crosses [rivers &amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
طَائِفٌ part. n. of طَافَ, signifying Going round<br>\
or round about, &amp;c. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,]<br>\
The عَسَس [quasi-pl. n. of عَاسٌّ]; (S, O, K, TA;)<br>\
[i. e.] the patrol, or watch that go the round of<br>\
the houses; thus expl. by Er-Rághib; and said<br>\
to mean particularly those who do so by night.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The bull that is next to the extremity, or side, of the كُدْس [or wheat collected<br>\
together in the place where it is trodden out].<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.) [See طَوْفٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  The طَائِف of<br>\
the bow is The part between the سِئَة [or<br>\
curved portion of the extremity] and the أَبْهَر<br>\
[q. v.]: (S, K:) or near [the length of a cubit or]<br>\
the bone of the fore arm from its [middle portion<br>\
called the] كَبِد [thus I render قَرِيبٌ مِنْ عَظْمِ<br>\
الذِّرَاعِ مِنْ كَبِدِهَا, which, I think, can have no<br>\
other meaning]: or the طَائِفَانِ are [two parts]<br>\
exclusive of the two curved ends (دُونَ السِّئَتَيْنِ):<br>\
(K: [this last explanation seems to leave one of<br>\
the limits of each طائف undefined:]) or, accord.<br>\
to AHn, the طائف of the bow is the part beyond<br>\
its كُلْيَة [q. v.], above and below, [extending] to<br>\
the place of the curving of the end of the bow: the<br>\
pl. is طَوَائِفُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  لَأَقْطَعَنَّ مِنْهُ طَائِفًا occurs<br>\
in a trad. respecting a runaway slave, as meaning<br>\
[I will assuredly cut off] some one, or more, of<br>\
his أَطْرَاف [app. meaning fingers]: or, as some<br>\
relate it, the word is طَابَِقًا. (TA.) And Aboo-Kebeer El-Hudhalee says,<br>\
تَقَعُ السُّيُوفُ عَلَى طَوَائِفَ مِنْهُمُ<br>\
meaning, it is said, [The swords fall upon] arms<br>\
and legs or hands and feet [of them: but in this<br>\
case, طَوَائِف may be pl. of ↓ طَائِفَةٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
One says also, أَصَابَهُ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ طَائِفٌ [A visitation from the Devil befell him]; and ↓ طَوْفٌ likewise, in the same sense. (TA. [See also<br>\
طَيْفٌ.])<br>\
طَائِفَةٌ A detached, or distinct, part or portion;<br>\
a piece, or bit; [or somewhat;] of a thing: (S,<br>\
Msb, K:) and a فِرْقَة of men [i. e. a party,<br>\
portion, division, or class, thereof; as those of<br>\
one profession or trade: a body, or distinct community: a sect: a corps: and sometimes a<br>\
people, or nation]: (Msb:) and a company, or<br>\
congregated body, (Msb, KL,) of men, at least<br>\

is said also on the authority of Mujáhid; (TA;)<br>\
so that it is syn. with نَفْسٌ [as meaning a single<br>\
person, or an individual]: (K:) [and sometimes<br>\
it is applied to a distinct number, or herd &amp;c., of<br>\
animals:] Er-Rághib says that when a plural or<br>\
collective number is meant thereby, it is [what<br>\
lexicologists term] a pl. of طَائِفٌ; and when<br>\
one is meant thereby, it may be a pl. metonymically used as a sing., or it may be considered as<br>\
of the class of رَاوِيَةٌ and عَلَّامَةٌ and the like:<br>\
(TA:) [pl. طَوَائِفُ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  See also طَائِفٌ, last<br>\
sentence but one.<br>\
