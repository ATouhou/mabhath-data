ط<br>\
The sixteenth letter of the alphabet; called طَآءٌ<br>\
[and طَا]; the ا of which is reduced to ى [as its<br>\
radical letter]: when you spell it, you make its<br>\
final letter quiescent; but when you apply an<br>\
epithet to it, and make it a noun, you decline it<br>\
as a noun, saying, [for instance,] هٰذِهِ طَآءٌ طَوِيلَةٌ<br>\
[This is a tall ط]: it is one of the letters termed<br>\
مَجْهُورَة [or vocal, i. e. pronounced with the voice,<br>\
and not with the breath only]; and of the letters<br>\
termed نِطْعِيَّة, like ت and د, because originating<br>\
from the نِطْع [q. v.] of the roof of the mouth.<br>\
(TA.) It is substituted for the ت in the measure<br>\
اِفْتَعَلَ and the forms inflected therefrom, and<br>\
[sometimes] for the pronominal ت, when immediately following any of the palatal letters [ص<br>\
and ض and ط and ظ]; (MF, TA;) as in<br>\
[اِصْطَبَرَ and اِضْطَرَبَ and اِطَّبَعَ and اِظْطَلَمَ, for<br>\
اِصْتَبَرَ and اِضْتَرَبَ and إِطْتَبَعَ and اِظْتَلَمَ; and in]<br>\
فَحَصْطُ and حِضْطُ and خَبَطُّ and حَفِظْطُ, for<br>\
فَحَصْتُ and حِضْتُ and خَبَطْتُ and حَفِظْتُ; but<br>\
some of the grammarians say that this [latter]<br>\
substitution is not to be made invariably; [nor is<br>\
it common;] and it is said to be a dialectal<br>\
peculiarity of some of the Benoo-Temeem.<br>\
(TA.) It is also substituted for د: thus Yaakoob<br>\
mentions, on the authority of As, مَطَّ الحُرُوفَ,<br>\
for مَدَّ الحُرُوفَ: and AO, المَبْطَأُ, for المَبْدَأُ: and<br>\
Aboo-&#39;Amr Ez-Záhid, in the Yawákeet, مَا أَبْعَدَ<br>\
طَارَكَ, for مَا أَبْعَدَ دَارَكَ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [As a numeral,<br>\
it denotes Nine.]<br>\
