تَطَرْثَثَ He gathered, or collected, the<br>\
species of plants called طُرْثُوث. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
طَرْثٌ Any plant (نَبَات, K [so in the TA and<br>\
in my MS. copy of the K, in the CK بِناء, which<br>\
is an evident mistranscription,]) that is fresh and<br>\
juicy. (K.)<br>\
طِرْثٌ The extremity of the بَظْر [q. v.]. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And Flaccidity, or flabbiness. (L.)<br>\
طُرْثُوثٌ A species of plant, which is eaten; (S,<br>\
K;) [app. a kind, or species, of fungus; perhaps<br>\
a species of phallus;] a plant of the same kind as<br>\
the ذُؤْنُون and the عُرْجُون; (IAar, T in art. ذأن;)<br>\
accord. to Lth, a slender, oblong plant, inclining<br>\
to redness, and serving as a دِبَاغ to the stomach<br>\
[app. meaning a stomachic], included among<br>\
medicines, of which there is a bitter sort and<br>\
a sweet sort; (Msb;) in the M said to be a<br>\
plant of the sands, long and slender, similar to<br>\
the فُطْر [q. v.], inclining to redness, which dries,<br>\
and serves as a دِبَاغ to the stomach; n. un. with<br>\
ة; on the authority of AHn: it is of two sorts;<br>\
one sweet, which is the red; and one bitter, which<br>\
is the white; IAar says that it is a plant of the<br>\
length of a cubit, having no leaves, as though it<br>\
were of the same kind as the truffle; (TA;) Az<br>\
says that the طرثوث of the desert has no leaves<br>\
(Msb, TA) nor any fruit, (TA,) grows in the<br>\
sands (Msb, TA) and in the level grounds, (TA,)<br>\
has in it no acidity, (Msb,) but a sweetness inclining to astringency and bitterness, and is red,<br>\
with a round head, (Msb, TA,) like the glans of<br>\
a man&#39;s penis: (TA:) [Ibn-Seenà (whom we call<br>\
Avicenna), in his list of medicinal simples, (book<br>\
ii., p. 183 of the printed ed.,) describes طَرَاثِيث<br>\
as pieces of wood in a rotting state, of the thickness<br>\
of a finger, and in length less and more, having an<br>\
astringent taste, and dust-coloured; said to be<br>\
brought from the desert. See also سُوقَةٌ.] The<br>\
Arabs say, طَرَاثِيثُ لَا أَرْطَى لَهَا [Turthoothehs<br>\
without artáhs]: because the former grow not<br>\
save with the latter: a prov., like ذَآنِينُ لَا رِمْثَ<br>\
لَهَا: applied to him who is ruined, and has<br>\
nothing remaining, after having had ancestry<br>\
and rank and wealth. (TA. [See also art. ذأن,<br>\
last sentence.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  The glans of a man&#39;s<br>\
penis: (K, TA:) so called as being likened to<br>\
[the head of] the plant above described. (TA.)<br>\
