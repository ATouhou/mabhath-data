طَمُ3َ, (TA, [by rule it<br>\
should be<br>\
طَمِ3َ,]) inf. n. طُمُومٌ (MA, K, TA) and<br>\
طَمٌّ, (K, TA,) said of water, It was, or became,<br>\
abundant, (MA, K, TA,) and rose high, or to a<br>\
high pitch. (TA.) [See also طَمَى.] And طَمَّ<br>\
الوَادِى means [طَمَّ سَيْلُ الوَادِى i. e. The torrent<br>\
of the valley or water-course] rose high, or to a<br>\
high pitch, and predominated: whence the prov.,<br>\
جَرَى الوَادِى فَطَمَّ عَلَى القَرِىِّ; in explanation of<br>\
which Meyd says, i. e., [The torrent of the valley<br>\
or water-course (سَيْلُ الوَادِى) flowed, (so in the<br>\
Provs. of Meyd,)] and filled up, or choked up,<br>\
meaning destroyed by filling up, or choking up,<br>\
the channel by which the water ran into the<br>\
meadow: and he says that the prov. is applied to<br>\
the case in which evil exceeds the ordinary limit:<br>\
(Har p. 127:) [or, accord. to Z, it means a man&#39;s<br>\
overcoming his adversary: (Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov. i. 278:) but it should be observed that طَمَّ<br>\
in this sense is trans. without a prep.:] one says<br>\
of a torrent, (S, Meyd, and Har ubi suprà,)<br>\
طَمَّ الرَّكِيَّةَ, (S, Meyd, K, Har,) aor.<br>\
طَمُ3َ and<br>\
طَمِ3َ, (K,<br>\
TA,) the latter on the authority of IAar, inf. n.<br>\
طَمٌّ, (TA,) It filled up, or choked up, the well,<br>\
syn. دَفَنَهَا, (S, Meyd, K, Har,) or كَبَسَهَا, (IAar,<br>\
TA,) and made it even or level (سَوَّاهَا) [with the<br>\
ground around it]: (S, K:) and طَمَّ الشَّىْءَ بِالتُّرَابِ,<br>\
inf. n. طَمٌّ, He covered over the thing with earth,<br>\
or dust; syn. كَبَسَهُ: (TA:) and طَمَّ الإِنَآءَ, (K,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. طَمٌّ, (TA,) He filled the vessel (K,<br>\
TA) so that the contents overflowed its edges:<br>\
(TA:) and طَمَّ البِئْرَ وَغَيْرَهَا بِالتُّرَابِ, aor.<br>\
طَمُ3َ, inf. n.<br>\
طَمٌّ, He filled the well &amp;c. with earth, or dust, so<br>\
that it became even with the ground: (Mgh, *<br>\
Msb:) and طَمَّهَا التُّرَابُ The earth, or dust, so<br>\
filled it. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, i. e. from طَمَّ الوَادِى<br>\
meaning as expl. in the beginning of the next<br>\

to a high pitch, or had ascendency, and overcame:<br>\
(Msb:) or was, or became, great, or formidable.<br>\
(Har p. 127.) And أَمْرٌ يطمّ ولا يتمّ [app. يَطِمُّ<br>\
وَلَا يَتِمُّ, agreeably with analogy, in order to<br>\
assimilate the former verb with the latter, as is<br>\
often done; meaning (assumed tropical:)  An affair that is great,<br>\
or formidable, and that will not become accomplished]. (TA.) And طَمَّتِ الفِتْنَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The sedition,<br>\
or conflict and faction, or the like, was, or became,<br>\
vehement, or severe. (TA.) And دَاهِيَةٌ تطمُّ عَلَى<br>\
الدَّوَاهى [i. e. تَطُمُّ or تَطِمُّ], meaning (assumed tropical:)  [A calamity] that predominates over [the other calamities].<br>\
(Har p. 127.) ―<br>\

مَرَّيَطِمُّ, with kesr, inf. n. طَمِيمٌ, He passed along<br>\

طَمُ3َ, inf. n. طَمٌّ, (TA,) He<br>\
took somewhat from [the hair of] his head;<br>\
غضَّ مِنْهُ. (K. [So in my MS. copy: in the CK<br>\
and TA, erroneously, عَضَّ, with the unpointed<br>\
ع; and thus in the TK, in which, however, the<br>\
phrase is well expl., on the authority of the A,<br>\
as meaning he shaved a portion of his head: see<br>\
also the pass. part. n.]) And طَمَّ شَعَرَهُ, (S, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
طَمُ3َ, inf. n. طَمٌّ, (TA,) He cut his hair; (S,<br>\

full. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  He had a barbarousness, or<br>\
vitiousness, or an impotence, or impediment, in<br>\
his speech, or utterance, not speaking clearly, or<br>\

طَمٌّ [as an inf. n.: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  As a subst.,] see<br>\
the next paragraph.<br>\
طِمٌّ The sea: (S, K, TA:) said to be so called<br>\
because of its overwhelming what is in it (لِأَنَّهُ<br>\
طَمَّ عَلَى مَا فِيهِ): but in this sense the word is<br>\
said to be ↓ طَمٌّ, and to be pronounced with kesr<br>\
for the purpose of assimilating it to رِمٌّ. (TA.)<br>\
One says, جَآءَ بِالطِّمِّ وَالرِّمِّ, meaning He brought<br>\
much wealth: (S, TA:) or the meaning in this<br>\
instance is الامر الكثير [app. a mistranscription<br>\
for الأَمْر الكَبِير i. e. that which was a great event]:<br>\
so says As: or much of everything: or much and<br>\
little: thus accord. to Aboo-Tálib: or what was<br>\
moist and what was dry: or the leaves of trees,<br>\
and what had fallen off from them. (TA. [See<br>\
more voce رِم: and see also what here follows.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And Water: (K, TA:) or much water; as<br>\
also ↓ طَامٌّ/ [or مَآءٌ طَامٌّ]: (TA:) or the rubbish and<br>\
scum, and the like, that is upon its surface; or<br>\
that is driven along by it: (K, * TA:) and thus<br>\
expl. as used in the saying above-mentioned.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A large number: (K:) and this<br>\
also is said to be meant in the phrase above.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A wonderful thing; syn. عَجَبٌ<br>\
and عَجِيبٌ [which here, as in many other instances, evidently signify the same]: (K:) and<br>\
this too is said to be meant in the phrase above.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And A male ostrich: (K:) because<br>\
of the lightness of his pace. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And A<br>\
courser, or swift horse; as also ↓ طَمِيمٌ: (K, *<br>\
TA: [see also طَمُومٌ:]) called طِمٌّ because of.<br>\
his light and quick, or easy, running (لِطَمِيمِ<br>\
عَدْوِهِ); or as being likened to the sea, as a horse<br>\
is termed بَحْرٌ and سَكْبٌ and غَرْبٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
And A large ذَكَر: (K:) because its head is<br>\
مَطْمُوم [as though this epithet meant “ bare ”].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  الطِّمُّ is also said in the K to signify<br>\
الكَيِّسُ; but [SM says] I think that this is a<br>\
mistranscription for الطَّمُّ meaning الكَبْسُ [see<br>\
طَمَّ الرَّكِيَّةَ, in the first paragraph]. (TA.)<br>\
طُمَّةٌ A company, or congregated body, of men:<br>\
and the middle of them: one says, لَقِيتُهُ فى طُمَّةِ<br>\
القَوْمِ [I met him, or found him, in the company<br>\
of people, or in the midst of the people]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Error; or deviation from the right<br>\
course: and confusion, or perplexity, and inability<br>\
to see the right course. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Dirt, or<br>\
filth; syn. قَذَرٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Human dung.<br>\
(K.) AZ says, When thou givest good advice to<br>\
a man and he refuses to do aught but follow his<br>\
own opinion alone, دَعْهُ يَتَرَمَّعُ فِى طُمَّتِهِ [leave<br>\
him wallowing in his dung]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A<br>\
portion (K, TA) of herbage, mostly (TA) of what<br>\
is dry, or dried up. (K, TA.)<br>\
طَمِمٌ Hardy, strong, or sturdy: occurring thus,<br>\
without idghám, in a verse of &#39;Adee Ibn-Zeyd;<br>\
applied to a beast such as is termed قَارِحٌ. (TA.)<br>\
فَرَسٌ طَمُومٌ A swift horse. (TA. [See also<br>\
طِمٌّ.])<br>\
طَمِيمٌ: see طِمٌّ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A medley of men, or<br>\
people: and a multitude thereof. (TA.)<br>\
طَامٌّ [part. n. of 1]: see طِمٌّ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see the<br>\
paragraph here following.<br>\
طَامَّةٌ A calamity that predominates over others:<br>\
(K, and Har p. 127:) or simply a calamity. (TA.)<br>\
It is said in a trad. of Aboo-Bekr En-Nessábeh,<br>\
مَا مِنْ طَامَّةٍ إِلَّا وَفَوْقَهَا طَامَّةٌ (S, * TA) i. e. There is<br>\
no calamity but above it is a calamity. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And A great, or formidable, thing; as also ↓ طَامٌّ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A cry, or vehement cry, that overcomes everything. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And الطَّامَّةُ signifies<br>\
The resurrection: (S, Msb, K:) so called because<br>\
it surpasses, or predominates over, everything:<br>\
(S, * Msb, * TA:) and also called الطَّامَّةُ الكُبْرَى.<br>\
(Har p. 346.)<br>\
طِمْطِمٌ and ↓ طُمْطُمَانِىٌّ (S, K) and ↓ طِمْطِمِىٌّ<br>\
(K) and ↓ طُمَاطِمٌ (TA) A man having a barbarousness, or vitiousness, or an impotence, or<br>\
impediment, in his speech, or utterance, not speaking clearly, or correctly: (S, K, TA:) and Aboo-Turáb explains [the pl. of the first] طَمَاطِمُ as<br>\
meaning foreigners (عَجَم). (TA.) Hence the<br>\
saying of the poet, (S,) &#39;Antarah, (TA,)<br>\
تَأْوِى لَهُ قُلُصُ النَّعَامِ كَمَا أَوَتْ<br>\
خِرَقٌ يَمَانِيَّةٌ لِأَعْجَمَ طِمْطِمِ<br>\
(S, TA;) respecting which Fr relates his having<br>\
heard El-Mufaddal say that one of the most<br>\
learned of men explained to him الخِرَقُ اليَمَانِيَّةُ<br>\
as meaning the clouds [app. likened to rags of<br>\
cloth of El-Yemen], and الأَعْجَمُ الطِمْطِمُ as<br>\
meaning the sound of thunder: (TA:) or the<br>\
latter hemistich is thus:<br>\
حِزَقٌ يَمَانِيَّةٌ لِأَعْجَمَ طِمْطِمِ<br>\
and the verse means, To whom (referring to a<br>\
male ostrich) repair the young ostriches, like as<br>\
herds of camels of El-Yemen repair to one who<br>\
is impotent, and indistinct, or incorrect, in speech:<br>\
he likens the male ostrich, in respect of blackness,<br>\
and want of speech, to an Abyssinian pastor impotent, and indistinct, or incorrect, in speech.<br>\
(EM p. 231.) ―<br>\
-b2-  طِمْطِمٌ signifies also A sort<br>\
of sheep, haring small ears, and أَغْبَاب [or what<br>\
resemble dewlaps], like the اغباب of oxen: they<br>\
are in the region of El-Yemen. (IDrd, TA.)<br>\
طَمْطَمَةٌ A barbarousness, or vitiousness, or an<br>\
impotence, or impediment, in speech, or utterance,<br>\
so that the speech is not clear, or correct. (TA.<br>\
[See R. Q. 1, of which it is the inf. n.])<br>\
طِمْطِمِىٌّ: see طِمْطِمٌ.<br>\
طُمْطُمَانِىٌّ: see طِمْطِمٌ.<br>\
طُمْطُمَانِيَّةُ حِمْيَرَ The disapproved phraseology<br>\
[or pronunciation] of the dialect of Himyer, (K,<br>\
TA,) resembling the speech of the foreigners:<br>\
thus expl. by Mbr and Eth-Tha&#39;álibee and<br>\
others: or, as some say, their change of ل into<br>\
م [in اَمْ for اَلْ; of which see several exs. voce<br>\
أَمْ]. (TA.)<br>\
طَمْطَامٌ The middle of the sea. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And hence, (tropical:)  Much fire: or the midst of fire:<br>\
or the main part thereof: occurring in a trad. of<br>\
Aboo-Tálib. (TA.)<br>\
طُمَاطِمٌ: see طِمْطِمٌ.<br>\
[<br>\
أَذًى أَطَمُّ Vehement, or severe, annoyance,<br>\
molestation, harm, or hurt: in the TA carelessly<br>\
written اذا اطم; and there said to be from طَمَّتِ<br>\
الفِتْنَةُ, q. v. See also an ex. in the Ham p. 363;<br>\
where أَطَمْ occurs at the end of a verse for أَطَمَّ<br>\
used in a like sense; i. e. as an epithet, not as a<br>\
verb.]<br>\
أَطَامِيمُ is said in the K to signify The legs of<br>\
a beast: but AA says, respecting the phrase<br>\
مُسْتَعِدَّاتٌ أَطَامِيمُ in a verse of Ibn-Mukbil<br>\
describing a she-camel, that the former of these<br>\
words is used as meaning legs, and اطاميم means<br>\
brisk, active, or quick: and by another, or others,<br>\
this latter word is said to mean تَطِمُّ فِى السَّيْرِ, i. e.<br>\
that are quick in pace. (TA.)<br>\
شَعَرٌ مَطْمُومٌ means مَعْقُوصٌ [i. e. Hair plaited:<br>\
or twisted: &amp;c.]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And رَأْسٌ مَطْمُومٌ<br>\
A head of which all the hair is cut off. (K * and<br>\
TA in art. زق.) And مَطْمُومُ الرَّأْسِ A man having<br>\
all the hair of his head cut off. (TA in that art.)<br>\
