neighbourhood of the House of God [at Mekkeh],<br>\

IAar: (TA:) Az has mentioned it in this art.;<br>\
but if it be a word repeated, from طَارَ, aor. يَطُورُ,<br>\
its proper place is art. طور: the present art. would<br>\
be its proper place only if it were طَرْطِرْ [imperative of طَرْطَرَ]: (O:) [F says,] in my opinion it<br>\
should rightly be mentioned in art. طور; but Az<br>\
and others have mentioned it among reduplicate<br>\
words; therefore I have followed them, and<br>\
notified [the case]. (K.)<br>\

says, جَاؤُوا طُرًّا They came all; (S, TA;) and it is<br>\
said that طُرًّا is here in the accus. case as a denotative of state, or as an inf. n.: Sb mentions the<br>\
phrase مَرَرْتُ بِهِمْ طُرًّا I passed by them all; and<br>\
he says that the last word is used only as a<br>\
denotative of state: but Khaseeb En-Nasránee<br>\
used it otherwise; replying to one who said to<br>\
him, How art thou? أَحْمَدُ اللّٰهَ إِلَى طُرِّ خَلْقِهِ [I<br>\
praise God to all his creatures]; and the phrase<br>\
رَأَيْتُ بَنِى فُلَانٍ بِطُرٍّ I saw the sons of such a one,<br>\
all of them, has also been transmitted: some say<br>\
that طُرًّا in the first of the phrases above is put in<br>\
the place of an act. part. n., and is [originally]<br>\
an inf. n. (TA.)<br>\
طِرٌّ: see طُرَّةٌ, latter half.<br>\
