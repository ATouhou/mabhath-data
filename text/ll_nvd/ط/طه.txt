طَهْطَهَ He laughed immoderately: (L<br>\
voce كَدْكَدَ:) or you say طَهْطَهَ فِى ضَحِكِهِ,<br>\
meaning he laughed slightly; like طَحْطَحَ. (O<br>\
and TA in art. طح.)<br>\
طَهْ [at the commencement of the 20th chapter<br>\
of the Kur-án] means اِطْمَئِنّ [Be thou still,<br>\
&amp;c.]: (K, TA:) and thus it is expl. as occurring<br>\
in a trad. respecting Moses&#39; hearing the speech of<br>\
the Lord of Might: (TA:) or, as some say, it is<br>\
for طَأْ [imperative of وَطِئَ], meaning tread upon<br>\
the ground with the soles of both thy feet; because<br>\
the Prophet raised one of his feet in prayer:<br>\
(TA in art. وطأ:) or it means O man, in the<br>\
Abyssinian language; (Lth, K, TA;) or so in<br>\
Syriac, accord. to Katádeh; or so in Nabathæan,<br>\
accord. to other authorities: (TA:) read طٰهٰ,<br>\
with the two fet-hahs pronounced fully, it is two<br>\
letters of the alphabet (مِنَ الهِجَآءِ [strangely misunderstood by Freytag as meaning “ quibus<br>\
maledicitur ”]): (Lth, K, TA:) Ibn-Mes&#39;ood is<br>\
related to have read طِهِ, with the two kesrehs<br>\
pronounced fully: and Fr says that some divided<br>\
it, reading طِ هِ: (TA:) Abu-n-Nejm has called<br>\
it طَهَا. (TA in art. طهو, q. v.)<br>\
طَهْطَهَةٌ sing. of طَهَاطِهُ, (TA,) which signifies<br>\
The voices [or neighings] of horses. (K, TA.)<br>\
طَهْطَاهٌ, as an epithet applied to a horse, That<br>\
excites admiration by his beauty, or swift and<br>\
excellent; youthful; excelling in beauty. (Lth, L,<br>\
K, TA.)<br>\
