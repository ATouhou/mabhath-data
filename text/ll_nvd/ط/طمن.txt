طَامَنَ: see Q. Q. 1, in three places.<br>\
6<br>\
تَطَامَنَ: see Q. Q. 2: and also Q. Q. 4, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
Q. Q. 1<br>\
طَأْمَنَ ظَهْرَهُ, (S, Msb, and so in some<br>\
copies of the K,) with ء, (Msb,) or ↓ طَامَنَهُ, (TA,<br>\
and so in some copies of the K,) without ء, for<br>\
the ء in اِطْمَأَنَّ [q. v. infrà] is [said to be] for the<br>\
purpose of preventing the combination of two<br>\
quiescent letters, (TA,) or طَامَنَهُ also, the former<br>\
being the original, (Msb,) He (a man, Msb) bent<br>\
down his back; (Msb, TA;) he lowered it;<br>\
(Msb;) and طَمْأَنَهُ signifies the same. (S, K.)<br>\
[And in like manner one says of other things.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And الشَّىْءَ ↓ طَامَنَ [or طَأْمَنَهُ], and طَمْأَنَهُ,<br>\
He caused the thing to be, or become, still, in a<br>\
state of rest, quiet, or calm. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And<br>\
مِنْهُ ↓ طَامَنَ [or طَأْمَنَ], (S,) or طَمْأَنَ منه, (K,<br>\
TA,) He (a man, S) was, or became, at rest from<br>\
it, (S, K,) namely, an affair, or event. (K.) [The<br>\
inf. n. of طأمن is طَأْمَنَةٌ, said in the TA to be syn.<br>\
with اِطْمِئْنَانٌ. See also Q. Q. 4.]<br>\
Q. Q. 2<br>\
تَطَأْمَنَ [more commonly written<br>\
↓ تَطَامَنَ, without ء, and ↓ اِطْمَأَنَّ also (see رَكَعَ)]<br>\
He stooped, [bent himself down,] or lowered himself; syn. تَطَأْطَأَ. (S and TA in art. طأ, &amp;c.;<br>\
and R and TA in the present art.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
was, or became, lowly, humble, or submissive;<br>\
syn. خَضَعَ. (S and K in art. خضع, &amp;c.: in<br>\
some copies of each written with, and in others<br>\
without, ء.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also the next paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
Q. Q. 4<br>\
اِطْمَأَنَّ is said by some to be originally<br>\
[اِطْمَانَّ] like اِحْمَارَّ, (Msb,) as Esh-Shiháb states<br>\
in the Expos. of the Shifè, (TA,) and to be pronounced with ء for the purpose of avoiding [the<br>\
combination of] the two quiescent letters, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) anomalously: (Msb:) and some say that<br>\
it is originally اِطْأَمَنَّ, (Msb, TA,) because you<br>\
say طَأْمَنَ الرَّجُلُ ظَهْرَهُ, with ء, (Msb,) or, as Suh<br>\
says, in the R, because it is from تَطأْمَنَ, the م<br>\
being put before the ء in order to render the<br>\
word more easy of pronunciation, (TA,) therefore<br>\
it is anomalous; (Msb;) Sb [likewise] held it to<br>\
be formed by transposition, and derived from<br>\
طَأْمَنَ; but AA held the contrary to be the case.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say, اِطْمَأَنَّتِ الأَرْضُ, and ↓ تَطَامَنَت<br>\
[or ↓ تَطَأْمَنَت], meaning The land, or ground, was,<br>\
or became, low, or depressed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also<br>\
Q. Q. 2. ―<br>\
-b4-  اطمأنّ, (S, Mgh, K,) inf. n. اِطْمِئْنَانٌ<br>\
and طُمَأْنِينَةٌ, (S, K,) or the latter is a simple<br>\
subst., (Mgh, Msb,) signifies [also] He (a man,<br>\
S) was, or became, still, in a state of rest or ease,<br>\
quiet, or calm; syn. سَكَنَ; (S, Mgh;) as also<br>\
اِطْبَأَنَّ, which is formed by permutation. (S.)<br>\
And thus it signifies as said of the heart, i. e.<br>\
It was, or became, still, in a state of rest or<br>\
ease, quiet, calm, tranquil, unruffled, or free from<br>\
disquietude. (Msb.) Thus too in the saying,<br>\
اطمأن إِلَى كَذَا, i. e. (tropical:)  He trusted to such a<br>\
thing, or relied upon it, so as to become at rest<br>\
or ease, or quiet, in mind. (K, * TA.) And one<br>\
says also, اطمأنّ جَالِسًا [He became still, or at<br>\
rest, or at ease, sitting]: (TA:) and اطمأنّ بِنَا<br>\
الجُلُوسُ [lit. The sitting became still, or free from<br>\
disquiet, with us]; meaning اِسْتَقْرَرْنَا وَسَكَنَّا فِى<br>\
الجُلُوسِ [i. e. we became settled, or at rest or ease,<br>\
and still, in the sitting; or became seated at ease].<br>\
(Har p. 280.) And اطمأنّ بِالمَوْضِعِ [He settled<br>\
in the place; i. e.] he remained, stayed, abode,<br>\
or dwelt, in the place, and took it as his home.<br>\
(Msb.) And اطمأنّ عَمَّا كَانَ يَفْعَلُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [He became<br>\
at rest from that which he was doing;] i. e. he<br>\
desisted from that which he was doing. (TA.)<br>\
And ↓ فِيهِ تَطَامُنٌ [or ↓ تَطَأْمُنٌ] In him is quietness, calmness, or sedateness. (TA.)<br>\
طَمْنٌ: see مُطْمَئِنٌّ.<br>\
طُمَيْئِنٌ dim. of مُطْمَئِنٌّ; (S, K;) formed by<br>\
rejecting the م at the beginning, and one of the<br>\
two نs at the end, of the latter word. (S.)<br>\
طُمَأْنِينَةٌ an [irreg.] inf. n. of اِطْمَأَنَّ, (S, K,) or<br>\
a subst. therefrom; as such signifying [A depression in the ground; as, for instance, in the S and<br>\
K voce رَزْنٌ: (comp. مُطْمَأَنٌّ:) ―<br>\
-b2-  and also]<br>\
Stillness, a state of rest or ease, quietness, calmness, tranquillity, or freedom from disquietude.<br>\
(Mgh, Msb.)<br>\
طُمَيْئِينَةٌ dim. of طُمَأْنِينةٌ; formed by the rejection of one of the two نs in the latter word,<br>\
because it is augmentative. (S.)<br>\
مُطْمَأَنٌّ A place of depression or lowness in the<br>\
land or ground. (Mgh. [See also the following<br>\
paragraph.])<br>\
-A2-  مُطْمَأَنٌّ إِلَيْهِ (tropical:)  A thing to which<br>\
one trusts, or upon which one relies, so as to<br>\
become at rest or ease, or quiet, in mind. (S, K, *<br>\
TA.)<br>\
مُطْمَئِنٌّ A place low, or depressed. (Mgh,<br>\
Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A man (S) still, in a state of<br>\
rest or ease, quiet, or calm; (S, Mgh, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ طَمْنٌ, (K,) but this is a word unused in<br>\
the [genuine] language, (TA,) pl. طُمُونٌ. (K.)<br>\
Hence one says, هُوَ مُطْمَئِنٌّ إِلَى كَذَا (tropical:)  He is<br>\
trusting to such a thing, or relying upon it, so as<br>\
to be at rest or ease, or quiet, in mind. (S, K, *<br>\
TA.) And [it is said that] النَّفْسُ المُطْمَئِنَّةُ<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  The soul that has become at rest or ease,<br>\
quiet, or calm, by belief; and lowly, humble, or<br>\
submissive, to its Lord. (TA. [See the Kur<br>\
lxxxix. 27.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Taking for oneself a place<br>\
in the earth, or in a country, as a home, or settled<br>\
place of abode. (TA.)<br>\
طيو and طيى<br>\
1<br>\
طَيَا, aor. يَطْيُو, inf. n. طُيُوٌّ; and طَيَى, aor.<br>\
يَطْمِى, (S, K,) inf. n. طُمِىٌّ, (S,) thus in the<br>\
M [as well as in the S], or طَمْىٌ, thus in the K<br>\
and in the book of ISk; (TA;) said of water,<br>\
(S, K,) It became high, (K,) or it rose high, and<br>\
filled the channel in which it flowed. (S.) [See<br>\
also طَمَّ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And, both verbs, said of a plant,<br>\
It became tall. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (K, TA,) said of<br>\
the sea, and of a river, and of a well, (TA,) It<br>\
became full: (K, TA:) so says Lth. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And طَمَتْ بِزَوْجِهَا (tropical:)  She (a woman) exalted herself with her husband; syn. اِرْتَفَعَتْ بِهِ; (S, TA;)<br>\
from طَمَا or طَمَى said of water: (S:) or she<br>\
grinned at her husband. (Z, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  طَمَتْ بِهِ<br>\
هِمَّتُهُ, aor.<br>\
1َ2ُ3َ and<br>\
1َ2ِ3َ as above, (assumed tropical:)  His ambition<br>\
elevated him. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And طَمَا بِهِ said<br>\
of anxiety, and of grief, and of fear, (assumed tropical:)  It became<br>\
vehement in him: the following verse by himself<br>\
is quoted by Z:<br>\
قَدْ طَمَا بِى خَوْفُ المَنِيَّةِ لٰكِنْ<br>\
↓ خَوْفُ مَا يَعْقُبُ المَنِيَّةَ أَطْمَى<br>\
[(assumed tropical:)  The fear of death has become vehement in me,<br>\
but the fear of what will follow death is more<br>\
vehement.] (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And طَمَى, aor. يَطْمِى,<br>\
like طَمَّ, aor. يَطِمُّ, signifies He passed by, or<br>\
along, hastening, or going quickly: (S, TA:) and<br>\
hence, طَمَا [or طَمَى], said of a horse, He hastened, or went quickly. (TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
طَمَايَةٌ is said by Golius, as on the authority<br>\
of Z, to signify Solicitude, and fear: but probably, I think, from his having found طَيَايَةٌ هَمٌّ<br>\
وَخَوْفٌ erroneously written for طَمَا بِهِ هَمٌّ وَخَوْفٌ,<br>\
meaning “ fear became vehement in him. ”]<br>\
مَآءٌ طَامٍ Water rising high, and filling its<br>\
channel. (S.) And بَحْرٌ طَامٍ A [high or] copious<br>\
sea. (TA.)<br>\
أَطْمَى [More, and most, vehement]: see the<br>\
verse cited above.<br>\
