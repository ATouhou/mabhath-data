captive loosed from his bond) went his way:<br>\
(Msb:) or [simply] he went away, or departed:<br>\

(TA;) meaning to the punishment: (Bd, Jel:)<br>\

hurtful: (S:) or in which is no rain: or in<br>\
which is no wind: or in which the cold is mild:<br>\
(TA: [after which is added, من ايام طَلْقات:<br>\
but the last word seems, as in an instance before<br>\
mentioned, to be mistranscribed, or ايام (i. e.<br>\
أَيَّام) may be a mistake for لَيَالٍ:]) or لَيْلَةٌ طَلْقٌ<br>\
means a night in which is no cold: (AA, TA:)<br>\
or in which the wind is still: (O, TA:) and<br>\
لَيْلَةٌ طَلْقَةٌ sometimes means a moon-lit, or a light,<br>\
or bright, night: (IDrd, O, TA:) and one says<br>\
also ↓ لَيْلَةٌ طَالِقَةٌ, (K, TA,) meaning a still, or<br>\
calm, and light, or bright, night: (TA:) and<br>\
↓ لَيَالٍ طَوَالِقُ, (K, * TA,) meaning pleasant nights<br>\

فَلَمَّا عَلَتْهُ الشَّمْسُ فِى يَوْمِ طَلْقَةٍ<br>\
meaning يَوْمِ لَيْلَةٍ طَلْقَةٍ [And when the sun came<br>\
upon him, or it,] in a day of a night in which<br>\
was neither cold nor wind; i. e., in a day after<br>\
such a night; for the Arabs commence with the<br>\
night, before the day: and the phrase فِى يَوْمِ طَلْقَةٍ<br>\
occurs in like manner in a verse of Dhu-r-Rummeh. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\

Msb, TA,) [i. e.] a thing unrestricted, (TA,) i. e.<br>\
any affair in which one has power, or authority,<br>\
to act according to his own judgment or discretion or free will. (Msb.) One says, هٰذَا حَلَالٌ<br>\
طِلْقٌ (tropical:)  [This is lawful, &amp;c., unrestricted; using<br>\
the latter epithet as a corroborative]: and [in the<br>\
contr. case] حَرَامٌ غِلْقٌ. (TA.) And هُوَ لَكَ طِلْقًا<br>\

-b4-  [In consequence of a misplacement in some copies of the<br>\
K, several meanings belonging to طَلَقٌ are assigned to طِلْقٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  See also طَلَقٌ, latter half.<br>\
طَلَقٌ: see طَلْقٌ, second sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also the<br>\
subst. from طَلَقَتِ الإِبِلُ: (AZ, S, TA: [see 1,<br>\
second sentence:]) and [as such] signifying The<br>\
journeying [of camels] during the night to arrive<br>\
at the water in the next night, there being two<br>\
nights between them and the water; the first of<br>\
which nights is termed الطَّلَقُ [or لَيْلَةُ الطَّلَقِ (see<br>\
حَوْزٌ)]; the pastor loosing them to repair to the<br>\
water, [in the CK يَجْلِبُها is put for يُخَلِّيهَا,] and<br>\
leaving them to pasture while going thither: the<br>\
camels after the driving, during the first night, are<br>\
said to be ↓ طَوَالِقُ; and in the second night,<br>\
قَوَارِبُ: (S, O, K, TA:) or الطَّلَقُ signifies the<br>\
first of two days intervening between the camels<br>\
and the water; and القَرَبُ, the second: and لَيْلَةُ<br>\
الطَّلَقِ, the night in which the faces of the camels<br>\
are turned towards the water and during which<br>\
they are left to pasture; and لَيْلَةُ القَرَبِ, the<br>\
second night: (As, TA:) but it has been said<br>\
that لَيْلَةُ الطَّلَقِ means the second of the nights in<br>\
which the camels repair to the water: Th says<br>\
that الطَّلَقُ signifies the second of two days during<br>\
which the camels seek the water when it is two<br>\
days distant from them; and القَرَبُ, the first of<br>\
those days: and it is said that لَيْلَةُ الطَّلَقِ means<br>\
[the night of] the turning of the faces of the<br>\
camels towards the water: but this explanation<br>\
was not pleasing to ISd. (TA.) [See an ex.<br>\
voce حَوْزٌ, in which it is used tropically.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
A heat; i. e. a single run, or run at once, to a<br>\
goal, or limit; syn. شَوْطٌ; (S, IAth, O, Msb,<br>\
K, TA;) meaning a running, of a horse, without<br>\
restraining himself, [or without stopping,] to a<br>\
goal, or limit: (Msb:) and the utmost extent to<br>\
which a horse runs. (TA.) One says of a horse,<br>\
عَدَا طَلَقًا or طَلَقَيْنِ [He ran a heat or two heats].<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K. [In the CK, erroneously, طَلْقًا<br>\
and طَلْقَيْنِ.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (hence, TA) (tropical:)  A share, or<br>\
portion, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, A, O, K, TA,) of property<br>\
[&amp;c.]. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A shackle, or pair of<br>\

a rope strongly twisted, so that it will stand up.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And sing. of أَطْلَاقٌ which signifies The<br>\
[intestines into which the food passes from the<br>\
stomach, termed the] أَمْعَآء, or the أَقْتَاب of the<br>\
belly; (IDrd, O, K; * [in some copies of the last<br>\
of which, القُنْبُ is erroneously put for القِتْبُ as<br>\
one of the words explaining الطَّلَقُ;]) so in one or<br>\
more of the dialects: AO says, in the belly are<br>\
أَطْلَاق, of which the sing. is طَلَقٌ; (O, TA;)<br>\
meaning the lines, or streaks, (طَرَائِق,) of the<br>\
belly: and طَلَقُ البَطْنِ is also expl. [in like<br>\
manner] as meaning the جُدَّة of the belly; pl. as<br>\
above. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also The [plant called] شُبْرُم:<br>\
[but what plant is meant by this is doubtful:] or<br>\
a plant that is used in dyes: or this is a mistake:<br>\
(K:) [or] accord. to Ibn-&#39;Abbád, ↓ الطَّلْقُ is<br>\
what is used in dyes; and is said to be the شُبْرُم:<br>\
(O, TA: *) and (K) accord. to As, (O,) طَلَقٌ<br>\
signifies a sort of medicament, (O, K,) which,<br>\
when one is anointed therewith, (K,) i. e. with the<br>\
extract thereof, (TA,) prevents the burning of<br>\
fire: (K:) or a species of plant: so says As:<br>\
(O:) the appellation by which it is generally<br>\
known is ↓ طَلْق, with the ل quiescent; (O, K;)<br>\
or this pronunciation is incorrect: (K:) and<br>\
AHát mentions, (K, TA,) on the authority of<br>\
As, (TA,) its being termed ↓ طِلْقٌ: (K, TA:)<br>\
but it is not a plant: it is of the nature of stones,<br>\
and of [what are termed] لِخَاف [thin white<br>\
stones]; and probably he [referring to As] heard<br>\
that it is called كَوْكَبُ الأَرْضِ, and therefore<br>\
supposed it to be a plant; for if it were a plant,<br>\
fire would burn it; but fire does not burn it,<br>\
unless by means of artful contrivances: (O, TA:)<br>\
the word is arabicized, from تَلَكْ: (K, TA: in<br>\
the O written تِلك:) [it is the well-known mineral<br>\
termed talc:] the Ra-ees [Ibn-Seenà, whom we<br>\
call “ Avicenna,”] says, (TA,) it is a brightlyshining stone, that separates, when it is bruised,<br>\
into several laminæ and split pieces, of which are<br>\
made مَضَاوِى [correctly مَضَاوِئ, meaning small<br>\
circular panes which are inserted in apertures to<br>\
admit light,] for the [cupolas of] hot baths,<br>\
instead of glass: the best is that of El-Yemen;<br>\
then that of India; then that of El-Undulus [or<br>\
El-Andalus]: the art employed in dissolving it<br>\
consists in putting it into a piece of rag with some<br>\
pebbles and immersing it in tepid water, then<br>\
moving it about gently until it becomes dissolved<br>\
and comes forth from the piece of rag into the<br>\
water, whereupon the water is strained from it,<br>\
and it is put in the sun to dry. (K, TA.)<br>\
طَلِقٌ ذَلِقٌ: ―<br>\

طُلَقُ اللِّسَانِ: and لِسَانٌ طُلَقٌ ذُلَقٌ: see طَلْقٌ.<br>\
طُلُقٌ, (S, O, Msb, TA,) with two dammehs,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) or ↓ طَلْقٌ, (K,) but this requires<br>\
consideration, (TA,) Not shackled; applied to a<br>\
she-camel, (S, O, Msb, TA,) and to a he-camel,<br>\
(S, O, TA,) and to a person imprisoned; (O,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ طَالِقٌ applied to a she-camel; but<br>\
طُلُقٌ is more common: (Aboo-Nasr, TA:) the<br>\
pl. of طُلُقٌ is أَطْلَاقٌ. (S, TA.) See also طَلْقٌ,<br>\
second sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] لِسَانٌ طُلُقٌ ذُلُقٌ: ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
and طُلُقُ اليَدَيْن: see طَلْقٌ again. ―<br>\
-b4-  And طُلُقُ<br>\
إِحْدَى اَلقَوَائِمِ (assumed tropical:)  A horse having one of the legs<br>\
without [the whiteness termed] التَّحْجِيل. (S.)<br>\

(K, [in this case again deviating from other<br>\
authorities,]) (tropical:)  A horse without تَحْجِيل in the<br>\
right fore leg; (TA;) i. q. اليد اليمنى ↓ مُطْلَقُ.<br>\
(O, K, TA.) And اليَدَيْنِ ↓ مُطْلَقَ (assumed tropical:)  A horse<br>\
having the fore legs free from تحجيل. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  [As an epithet in which the quality of a subst.<br>\
is predominant,] طُلُقٌ, (Ibn-&#39; Abbád, O,) or ↓ طَلْقٌ,<br>\
(K, [but this, as in the instances above, is<br>\
questionable,]) signifies (assumed tropical:)  A gazelle: (Ibn-&#39; Abbád,<br>\
O, K:) so called because of the quickness of its<br>\
running: (O, * TA:) pl. أَطْلَاقٌ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád,<br>\
O, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And (assumed tropical:)  A dog of the chase: (K:)<br>\
because he is let loose; or because of the quickness of his running at the chase: (TA:) أَطْلَاقٌ<br>\
is mentioned by Ibn-&#39; Abbád as signifying dogs of<br>\
the chase. (O.)<br>\
طَلْقَةٌ [A single divorce: used in this sense in<br>\
law-books]. (T and Msb in art. بت, &amp;c.)<br>\
طُلَقَةٌ: see مِطْلَاقٌ.<br>\
طَلَاقٌ is the inf. n. of طَلَقَت said of a woman:<br>\
(Th, S, Mgh, O, K:) or the subst. therefrom:<br>\
(Msb:) or [rather] it is also a subst. in the sense<br>\
of تَطْلِيقٌ; (Mgh;) [whence,] طَلَاقُ المَرْأَةِ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The letting the wife go her way: (Lth,<br>\
O:) and it has two meanings: one is [the divorcing of the woman; i. e.] the dissolving of the<br>\
wife&#39;s marriage-tie: and the other is the leaving,<br>\
and dismissing, of the wife [either in an absolute<br>\
sense or as is done by a single sentence of<br>\
divorce]. (O, TA.) Some of the lawyers hold<br>\
that the free woman whose husband is a slave is<br>\
not separated but by three [sentences, as is the<br>\
case when both husband and wife are free]; and<br>\
the female slave whose husband is free, by two:<br>\
some, that the wife in the former case is separated<br>\
by two [sentences]; and in the latter case, by<br>\
not less than three: and some, that when the<br>\
husband is a slave and the wife is free, or the<br>\
reverse, or when both are slaves, the wife is<br>\
separated by two [sentences]. (TA.)<br>\
طَلِيقٌ A captive having his bond loosed from<br>\

from slavery; emancipated; i. q. عَتِيقٌ; i. e.<br>\
who has become free: pl. طُلَقَآءُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is<br>\
said in a trad., الطُّلَقَآءُ مِنْ قُرَيْشٍ وَالعُتَقَآءُ مِنْ ثَقِيفٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [The طُلَقَآء are of Kureysh; and the عُتَقَآء, of<br>\
Thakeef]: الطلقاء being app. applied to Kureysh<br>\
as it has a more special signification than العتقاء:<br>\
but accord. to Th, الطُّلَقَآءُ signifies those who<br>\
have been brought within the pale of El-Islám<br>\
against their will. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  طَلِيقُ اللِّسَانِ: and<br>\
لِسَانٌ طَلِيقٌ ذَلِيقٌ: ―<br>\

طَالِقٌ A she-camel not having having her fore<br>\
shank and her arm bound together: (TA:) or<br>\
not having upon her a خِطَام [or halter]: (IDrd,<br>\
O, K:) or repairing to the water; and so<br>\
↓ مِطْلَاقٌ; (Aboo-Nasr, K, TA;) of which latter<br>\
she pl. is مَطَالِيقُ: (TA:) or that is left a day<br>\
and a night and then milked: (K:) pl. طَوَالِقُ<br>\
and أَطْلَاقٌ and طَلَقَةٌ; which last is expl. by AA<br>\
as meaning she-camels that are milked in the<br>\
place of pasturing. (TA.) See also طُلُقٌ, first<br>\
sentence: and for an explanation of the pl. طَوَالِقُ<br>\
applied to camels, see طَلَقٌ, second sentence.<br>\
Also (O), طَالِقٌ, (S, O,) or طَالِقَةٌ, (K,) signifies<br>\
A she-camel which the pastor leaves for himself,<br>\
not milking her at the water: (S, O, K:) the<br>\
former is expl. by Esh-Sheybánee as meaning<br>\
one which the pastor leaves [with her udder bound]<br>\
with her صِرَار, not milking her in the place where<br>\
she lies down to rest: (TA:) or the latter signifies,<br>\
(Lth, O, K,) and the former also, (Lth, O,) a she-camel that is set loose among the tribe to pasture<br>\
where she will in any part of the tract adjacent to<br>\
their place of alighting or abode, (Lth, O, K, [من<br>\
جِنانِهِمْ in the CK being erroneously put for مِنْ<br>\
جَنَابِهِمْ,]) that has not her fore shank and her<br>\
arm bound together when she returns in the afternoon or evening, nor is turned away [from the<br>\
others] in the place of pasturage: (Lth, O:) or<br>\
طَالِقٌ signifies a she-camel, (S, Msb,) and a ewe,<br>\
(S,) that is set loose, or dismissed, to pasture<br>\
where she will: (S, Msb:) and also as first expl.<br>\
in this sentence: (S:) it is mentioned by ElFárábee as signifying a ewe left to pasture by<br>\
herself, alone. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] طَالِقٌ and<br>\
طَالِقَةٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) the former, without ة,<br>\
used by all, (Msb,) the latter occurring in a verse<br>\
of El-Aashà, (S, Mgh, * O, Msb,) ending a hemistich, and pronounced طَالِقَةٌ, (S, O, Msb, [which<br>\
cite the verse somewhat differently,]) (tropical:)  A woman<br>\
[divorced, or] left to go her way, (S, * Mgh, * O,<br>\
Msb, *) or separated from her husband [by a<br>\
sentence of divorce]: (S, * Mgh, * Mgh, * K, TA:)<br>\
both mentioned by Akh: (O, TA:) accord. to<br>\
IAmb, one says طَالِقٌ only, because it applies<br>\
only to a female: accord. to Lth and IF, طَالِقَةٌ<br>\
means طَالِقَةٌ غَدًا [divorced, &amp;c., to-morrow]; and<br>\
Lth adds that it is thus to accord with its verb,<br>\
طَلَقَتْ: some, however, say that the ه is affixed<br>\
in the verse of El-Aashà by poetic license, to<br>\
complete the hemistich; but an Arab of the desert,<br>\
in reciting this verse to As, is related to have<br>\
said طَالِقٌ [which equally completes the hemistich]: and the Basrees hold that the sign of the<br>\
fem. gender is elided in طَالِقٌ because it is a possessive epithet, meaning ذَاتُ طَلَاقٍ [having<br>\
divorce]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
