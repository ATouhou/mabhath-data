طَنِئَ, aor.<br>\
طَنَاَ, said of a camel, He had his<br>\
spleen adhering to his side. (K.) And, said of a<br>\
man, He had a tertian fever, and his spleen in<br>\
consequence became enlarged. (Lh, TA.) Thus<br>\
pronounced by some with ء [for طَنِىَ, q. v.].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَطْنَأَ [He suffered not to retain the last<br>\
remains of life]. One says, هٰذِهِ حَيَّةٌ لَا تُطْنِئُ<br>\
This is a serpent that will not suffer one to<br>\
survive; (S, O, K; *) that hills instantly: also<br>\
without ء, but originally with ء; from طِنْءٌ in<br>\
the first of the senses assigned to it below.<br>\
(S, O.)<br>\
طِنْءٌ The [last] remains of the vital spirit.<br>\
(S, O, K.) One says, تَرَكْتُهُ بِطِنْئِهِ I left him<br>\
with the [last] remains of life. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
The remains of water in a watering-trough, or<br>\
tank. (O, K, TA.) And it is said that رَوْضَةٌ,<br>\
by which it is also expl. in the K [and in the O],<br>\
has this meaning [as well as that of A meadow,<br>\
&amp;c.]; and therefore this explanation without the<br>\
former is given in the L. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Ashes<br>\
in a state of extinction: (O, K:) and so طَنًى.<br>\
(K and TA in art. طنى.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And app. A bier;<br>\
for this is a meaning assigned to نَيْطٌ; and] one<br>\
says, رُمِىَ فُلَانٌ فِى طِنْئِهِ [and فى طِنْيِهِ] and فى<br>\
نَيْطِهِ [Such a one was cast into his bier]; meaning, when he died. (AZ, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And A disease,<br>\
or malady. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  And Doubt, or suspicion, or<br>\
evil opinion; or a thing that occasions doubt or<br>\
suspicion or evil opinion; syn. رِيبَةٌ; (S, O, K,<br>\
TA; in the CK رُبْيَة;) and تُهَمَةٌ: (TA:) and so<br>\
طِنْىً. (TA in art. طنى.) Fr. cites,<br>\
كَأَنَّ عَلَى الطِّنْءِ عَيْنًا بَصِيرَةً<br>\
meaning, عَلَى ذِى الرِّيبَةِ [i. e. As though there<br>\
were a discerning eye upon him in whom is that<br>\
which occasions doubt, &amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
