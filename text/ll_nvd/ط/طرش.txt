طَرِشَ, aor.<br>\
طَرَشَ, (Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. طَرَشٌ,<br>\
(S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) He was, or became, deaf:<br>\
or affected with something less than صَمَمٌ [or deafness]: (Msb:) or like deafness: (Mgh:) [meaning,<br>\
heaviness, or dulness, of hearing: (see أَطْرَشُ:)] or<br>\
طَرَشٌ is the slightest deafness: (S, A, K: [in the CK<br>\
it is erroneously written طَرْش:]) but some say that<br>\
it is not pure Arabic: (Msb:) and some say that<br>\
it is post-classical: (S, Msb, K:) so says IDrd:<br>\
(O:) AHát disallows the root and its derivatives,<br>\
and says that they have not been content with the<br>\
barbarousness of saying طَرَشٌ, but have formed<br>\
from it a verb, namely, طَرِشَ: (O, TA:) ElMa&#39;arree says that the verb has been formed by<br>\
the vulgar from أُطْرُوشٌ, which is an Arabic<br>\
word. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تطرّش He stood and sat; said of one who<br>\
is convalescent: (O:) or he became convalescent,<br>\
and nearly recovered, and arose and walked; syn.<br>\
اِبْرَغَشَّ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تطرّش بِالبَهْمِ i. q. اِخْتَلَفَ بِهَا<br>\
[i. e. He went to and fro, repeatedly, with the<br>\
young lambs or kids: strangely expl. in the TK<br>\
as said of a camel, and as meaning he became<br>\
mixed, or confounded, among the beasts]. (O, K.)<br>\
6<br>\
تطارش He feigned himself deaf: (O, K:)<br>\
or heavy, or dull, of hearing. (Mgh.)<br>\
بِهِ طُرْشَةٌ In him is the slightest deafness. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
أَطْرَشُ, (Msb,) or ↓ أُطْرُوشٌ, (Az, A, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) of which Az says, I know not whether<br>\
it be Arabic or adventitious, (Msb,) and IDrd<br>\
says that it is not genuine Arabic, (Mgh,) and<br>\
AHát disallows it, but El-Ma&#39;arree says that it<br>\
is Arabic, though the verb is a barbarism, (TA,)<br>\
Deaf; (Msb, K;) and in some of the copies of<br>\
[the work of] Yaakoob, ↓ أُطْرُشٌ is found, thus<br>\
expl.: (TA:) or heavy, or dull, of hearing:<br>\
(Mgh:) or affected with something less than<br>\
deafness: (Msb:) or with the slightest deafness:<br>\
(A:) the fem. of أَطْرَشُ is طَرْشَآءُ: (Msb:) and<br>\
the pl. is طُرْشٌ. (Mgh, O, Msb, K. *)<br>\
-A2-  Accord.<br>\
to Z, [in the A,] أَطْرَشُ, applied to a man, signifies Having thin eyebrows. (TA. [But I<br>\
think that this is a mistranscription for أَطْرَطُ.])<br>\
