طَاقَهُ, inf. n. طَوْقٌ: see 4.<br>\
2<br>\
طوّقه, (S, TA,) or طوّقهُ طَوْقًا, (O, K, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. تَطْوِيقٌ, (TA,) He attired him with a طَوْق<br>\
[or neck-ring]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] طَوَّقْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  I made the thing to be [as though it<br>\
were] his طَوْق [or neck-ring]: and thereby is<br>\
expressed the imposing [upon one] a thing that<br>\
is difficult, troublesome, or inconvenient: (Msb:)<br>\
[i. e.] طَوَّقْتُكَ الشَّىْءَ means (assumed tropical:)  I imposed, or have<br>\
imposed, upon thee the thing as one that is difficult, troublesome, or inconvenient. (S, O, K. *)<br>\
سَيُطَوَّقُونَ مَا بَخِلُوا بِهِ, in the Kur [iii. 176],<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  They shall have that whereof they were<br>\
niggardly made to cleave to their necks [like the<br>\
neck-ring]: (O, TA:) as is said in a trad., it<br>\
shall be made a biting snake upon the neck.<br>\
(Jel.) And [in the Kur ii. 180] some read,<br>\
وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ يُطَوَّقُونَهُ, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
يُطَوِّقُونَهُ,] meaning, (assumed tropical:)  And upon those who shall<br>\
have it put [upon them] like the طَوْق upon<br>\
their necks [shall be incumbent &amp;c.]: (K, TA:)<br>\
which is like the saying يُجَشَّمُونَهُ and يُكَلَّفُونَهُ<br>\
[i. e. shall have it imposed upon them as a thing<br>\
that is difficult, troublesome, or inconvenient]:<br>\
(TA:) another reading is ↓ يَطَّوَّقُونَهُ, [in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, يُطَّوَّقُونَهُ,] originally يَتَطَوَّقُونَهُ [meaning the same as the former reading]: and another,<br>\
↓ يُطَيَّقُونَهُ, originally يُطَيْوَقُونَهُ [also meaning the<br>\
same; in the CK, erroneously, يُطَيْقُونَهُ]: and<br>\
another, ↓ يَطَّيَّقُونَهُ, [in the CK, erroneously, with<br>\
damm to the first letter, and so in what follows,]<br>\
originally يَتَطَيْوَقُونَهُ [also meaning the same].<br>\
(K, TA.) One says also, طوّقهُ بِهِ and طوّقهُ إِيَّاهُ,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  He made it, namely, a sword, &amp;c.,<br>\
to be to him a طَوْق [or thing encircling, or going<br>\
round, his neck]. (TA.) And طَوَّقَنِى نِعْمَةً<br>\
(tropical:)  [He conferred upon me a permanent badge of<br>\
favour]: and طُوِّقْتُ مِنْهُ أَيَادِىَ (tropical:)  [I had permanent badges of favours from him conferred<br>\
upon me]: and the verb is also used [in like<br>\
manner] to denote dispraise, to which it has been<br>\
erroneously said by some to be restricted. (TA.<br>\
[See also 2 in art. قلد: and see طَوْقٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
طوّقت الحَيَّةُ: see 5.<br>\

or empowered me, sufficiently for the giving, or<br>\
paying, of thy due, or of his due: syn. قَوَّانِى (S,<br>\

K) is syn. with طَوَّعَتْ, (Akh, S, O,) meaning<br>\

اطاق الشَّىْءَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) and اطاق عَلَيْهِ,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. إِطَاقَةٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) and طَاقَةٌ is<br>\
the subst. (Az, Msb, K) used in the place of the<br>\
inf. n. like طَاعَةٌ in the place of إِطَاعَةٌ, (Az, TA,)<br>\
He was, or became, able to do, or accomplish,<br>\
or to bear, the thing; (S, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ طَاقَهُ, (Az, * K,) aor. يَطُوقُ, (Az, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
طَوْقٌ. (Az, K.) It is not used exclusively of a<br>\
human being, as some assert it to be; but is used<br>\
in a general manner. (TA.) [One says لَا يُطَلقُ<br>\
meaning He will not be, or is not to be, coped<br>\
with: and also as meaning it is not to be done, or<br>\
to be borne, endured, or tolerated: and so مَا يُطَاقُ:<br>\
see an ex. voce حَمْضَ.]<br>\
5<br>\
تطوّق He put on, or attired himself with,<br>\
a طَوْق [or neck-ring]. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,<br>\
تطوّقهُ, and تطوّق بِهِ, (assumed tropical:)  He had it put upon him,<br>\
and he bore it, and he took it upon himself, like<br>\
the طَوْق upon the neck: and he had it imposed<br>\
upon him, and he imposed it upon himself, as a<br>\
thing that was difficult, troublesome, or inconvenient]. See 2. [See also Har p. 310. And<br>\
see 5 in art. قلد.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And تطوّقت الحَيَّةُ عَلَى عُنُقِهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  The serpent became like the طَوْق upon his neck;<br>\

يَطَّيَّقُونَهُ, originally يَتَطَيْوَقُونَهُ: see 2.<br>\
طَاقٌ A curved construction or structure; (S,<br>\
O, K;) [said to be] a Pers. word arabicized; (S,<br>\
O;) and its pl. is طَاقَاتٌ and طِيقَانٌ: (S, O, K:)<br>\
or an arch of a building, wherever it is; and the<br>\
pl. is أَطْوَاقٌ and طِيقَانٌ: (JK, TA:) and as signifying [thus, or] an arch constructed with bricks,<br>\
it is [said to be] originally ↓ طَائِقٌ; and therefore<br>\
to have for its pl. طَوَائِقُ: so says Az. (TA.)<br>\
[It is often applied to An arched gateway or<br>\
doorway: and to a vault. And] i. q. كُوَّةٌ [i. e.<br>\
A mural aperture; a hole, or an aperture, in a<br>\
wall; a meaning also assigned to إِفْرِيزٌ, by which<br>\
طَاقٌ will be found to be expl. in what follows:<br>\
or a niche in a wall; which, as also a window,<br>\
is now often called ↓ طَاقَةٌ]. (So in the Munjid<br>\
of Kr.) [And app. A kind of arched construction with a flat top which forms a shelf, against a<br>\
wall. (See رَفٌّ and سَهْوَةٌ.)] And i. q. إِفْرِيزٌ [which<br>\
is expl. as meaning a projecting roof or covering<br>\
of a wall: and a projecting coping, or ledge, or<br>\
cornice, surrounding the upper part of a wall:<br>\
and in the KL as meaning a hole, or an aperture,<br>\
of a wall; (as mentioned above;) but its author<br>\
adds “ so we have heard ”]: (MA voce إِفْرِيزٌ:)<br>\
or so أَطْوَاقٌ. (JK, and O on the authority of<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Abbád. [But this I think doubtful, and the<br>\
more so as it will be seen in what follows that<br>\
another meaning assigned in these same lexicons<br>\
to أَطْوَاقٌ is said by IB to be a meaning of طَاقٌ.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also طَائِقٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  [Also A<br>\
layer, stratum, lamina, or the like; or any flat<br>\
piece, or portion, of a thing, such as is in some<br>\
cases placed over, or under, a similar piece or<br>\
portion: and anything such as is in some cases<br>\
lined, or faced, or otherwise combined, with another<br>\
similar thing: pl. طَاقَاتٌ.] You say طَاقُ نَعْلٍ<br>\
[A single piece of leather of a sole that consists of<br>\
two or more of such pieces]; (S, O, K;) and<br>\
نعْلٍ ↓ طَاقَةُ [which means the same]. (K.) And<br>\
نَعْلٌ طَاقٌ وَاحِدٌ A single sole; i. e. a sole of a<br>\
single piece; not made of two pieces sewed together,<br>\
one upon the other. (TA in art. نعل.) And [in<br>\
like manner] a garment is said to be طَاقٌ وَاحِدٌ<br>\
[i. e. Single, not double, not lined nor faced nor<br>\
stuffed]. (Az, in TA in art. سمط, [where this<br>\
meaning is clearly indicated,] and Th, in M,<br>\
same art.) Thus one says سَرَاوِيلُ طَاقٌ وَاحِدٌ<br>\
[Trousers, or drawers, of single cloth]. (Th, M<br>\
and K in art. سمط.) [See also what is said of<br>\
the phrase السَّرَاوِيلُ الطَّاقُ voce رِجْلٌ.] One says<br>\
also غَزْلٌ طَاقٌ وَاحِدٌ [Spun thread that is a single<br>\
yarn]: and غَزْلٌ مَفْتُولٌ طَاقَيْنِ [Spun thread<br>\
twisted of two yarns]. (S and TA in art. سحل.)<br>\
See also طَاقَةٌ, which has a similar meaning. [And<br>\
see an ex. of the pl. طَاقَات voce رَبْعَةٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
A certain sort of garment, (S, O, K,) having<br>\
sleeves. (S, O.) [And] accord. to Esh-Shereeshee, A garment worn by a new-born child, or<br>\
young infant, without an opening at the bosom.<br>\
(Har p. 502.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (O, K) accord. to IAar,<br>\
(O,) A [garment of the kind called] طَيْلَسَان<br>\
[q. v.]: (O, K:) or such as is أَخْضَر [properly<br>\
meaning green; but when applied to a garment<br>\
commonly meaning, as used by the Arabs, of a<br>\
dark, or an ashy, dust-colour; or a dingy ashcolour]: (Kr, K:) pl. طِيقَانٌ, like سِيجَانٌ pl. of<br>\
سَاجٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A [garment of the kind<br>\
called] كِسَآءِ: (IB, TA:) and (TA) so أَطْوَاقٌ.<br>\
(JK, and O and TA on the authority of Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád. [But this, as I have shown above, I<br>\
think doubtful.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A [woman&#39;s muffler,<br>\
or head-covering, such as is called] خِمَار. (IAar,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And one says, رَأَيْتُ أَرْضًا كَأَنَّهَا الطِّيقَانُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [I saw a land as though it were spread with the<br>\
garments called طيقان]; meaning, whereof the<br>\
herbage was abundant. (TA.)<br>\
طَوْقٌ [A neck-ring;] a certain ornament for<br>\
the neck; (K;) a thing well known: (Msb:) [its<br>\
most usual from is figured in my work on the<br>\
Modern Egyptians, Appendix A:] pl. أَطْوَاقٌ.<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K.) It is said in a prov., كَبِرَ عَمْرٌو<br>\
عَنِ الطَّوْقِ [&#39;Amr has become too much advanced<br>\
in age for the neck-ring]: (A &#39;Obeyd, O, K, TA:<br>\
in some copies of the K [erroneously] كَبُرَ:) or<br>\
شَبَّ عَمْرٌو عَنِ الطَّوْقِ, [which has the like meaning,] as in most of the books of proverbs: (TA:)<br>\
applied to him who occupies himself with a thing<br>\
that is beneath his ability. (K. [For the story<br>\
of the origin of this prov., see Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov. ii. 319-21, or Har pp. 502-3; as it is too<br>\
long to be quoted here.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Anything that<br>\
surrounds another thing (Msb, K) is called its<br>\
طَوْق. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence ذَاتُ الطَّوْقِ as an appel-lation of The [ringed] pigeon [or ring-dove].<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And hence] one says, تَقَلَّدْتُ النِّعْمَةَ<br>\
طَوْقَ الحَمَامَةِ (tropical:)  [I bore the favour as the ring of<br>\
the pigeon; meaning, as a permanent badge or<br>\
decoration]: and فِى عُنُقِى طَوْقٌ مَا لِى بِأَدَآءِ شُكْرِهِ<br>\
طَوْقٌ (tropical:)  [Upon my neck is a permanent badge or<br>\
decoration, for which I have not ability to render<br>\
due acknowledgment]: so in the A: hence also the<br>\
saying of El-Mutanebbee,<br>\
أَقَامَتْ فِى الرِّقَابِ لَهُ أَيَادٍ<br>\
هِىَ الأَطْوَاقُ وَالنَّاسُ الحَمَامُ<br>\
[Favours of his have remained upon the necks:<br>\
they are the neck-rings, and the men are the<br>\
pigeons]. (TA. [See, for this verse, p. 164 of<br>\
Dieterici&#39;s ed. of the Deewán of El-Mutanebbee.])<br>\

-A2-  See also the<br>\
next paragraph, first and second sentences.<br>\
طَاقَةٌ is the subst. from أَطَاقَ, (Az, Msb, K,)<br>\
and is used in the place of the inf. n., (Az, TA,)<br>\
and [when used as a simple subst.] signifies<br>\
Ability, or power; (S, O, * Msb, K;) and so<br>\
↓ طَوْقٌ, (S, O, K,) which is [originally] an inf. n.,<br>\
(Az, K,) and is also expl. as meaning the utmost<br>\
that one can do, with difficulty, trouble, or inconvenience. (TA.) One says, [لَا طَاقَةَ لِى بِهِ I<br>\
have not ability, or power, to do it, or to bear or<br>\
endure or tolerate it: and, to cope with him:<br>\
(see Kur ii. last verse: and verse 250:) and]<br>\
↓ هُوَ فِى طَوْقِى It is within my ability, or power.<br>\
(S.) In the phrase طَلَبْتَهُ طَاقَتَكَ, [as meaning<br>\
Thou soughtest him, or it, in thy state of ability, or<br>\
power,] Sb says, the [quasi-] inf. n. is prefixed [to<br>\
the pronoun, and thus rendered determinate],<br>\
though occupying the place of a denotative of<br>\
state; in like manner as the article ال is prefixed<br>\
[to عراك] in the phrase أَرْسَلَهَا. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
[Also A slender and small bundle or fascicle of<br>\
fibres or filaments or the like, one of those whereof two or more, twisted together, compose a rope;<br>\

syn. قُوَّةٌ; (S voce قُوَّةٌ;) and so مِنْ حَبْلٍ ↓ طَاقٌ,<br>\

pieces of wood [or planks] of a ship, or boat:<br>\
(S, O, K:) or طَائِقٌ signifies one of the pieces of<br>\
wood [or planks] of the interior of a زَوْرَق [or<br>\

a ship, or boat, like a ledge swelling out from a<br>\

K, TA:) AHn says, (O, TA,) it is very intoxicating; (O, K, TA;) moderately as long as its<br>\
drinker does not go forth to the wind; but if he<br>\
does so, his intoxication becomes excessive; (K,<br>\
TA;) and when he who is not accustomed to it,<br>\
(O, K, TA,) and is not suited to it, (O, TA,)<br>\
continues constantly the drinking of it, it vitiates<br>\
his intellect, (O, K, TA,) and confuses his<br>\
