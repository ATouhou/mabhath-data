motion, or in a state of commotion, and looked:<br>\
(M, TA:) or الطَّرْفُ signifies the putting the<br>\
eyelids in motion, or in a state of commotion, in<br>\
looking: (Mgh, * TA:) one says, شَخَصَ بَصَرُهُ فَمَا<br>\
يَطْرِفُ [His eye, or eyes, has, or have, become<br>\
fixedly open, or raised, and he does not put his<br>\
eyelids in motion, or does not twinkle with his<br>\
eye, or eyes, in looking]: (TA:) [or] one says,<br>\
طَرَفَ البَصَرُ, aor. and inf. n. as above, meaning<br>\
the eye, or eyes, [twinkled, or] became in a state<br>\
of commotion: (Msb:) [or] طَرَفَ بَصَرَهُ, (O, K,<br>\

and طُرِفَتْ عَيْنُهُ, aor. تُطْرَفُ, inf. n. as above, his<br>\
eyelids were put in motion or in a state of commotion, by looking. (As, TA.) [Another meaning of طَرَفَ بَصَرَهُ, and another of طُرِفَتْ said<br>\
of the eye, will be found below.] عَيْنٌ تَطْرِفُ,<br>\
signifying An eye that [twinkles, or] puts the<br>\
eyelid in motion, or in a state of commotion, with<br>\
looking, is used for ذُو عَيْنٍ تَطْرِفُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  a<br>\

twinkling] means (tropical:)  they died, (O, K, TA,) or<br>\

الطَّرْفُ is used as meaning the act of looking (Er-Rághib, Msb, TA) because the putting in motion<br>\

shall not revert to them; i. e., shall not be withdrawn by them from that upon which they shall<br>\
look]. (S, O.) And in the same [xxvii. 40],<br>\
أَنَا آتِيكَ بِهِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَرْتَدٌ إِلَيْكَ طَرْفُكَ, [meaning, in<br>\
like manner, I will bring it to thee before thy<br>\
look at a thing shall revert to thee, or be withdrawn by thee therefrom: or,] accord. to Fr,<br>\
meaning before a thing shall be brought to thee<br>\
from the extent of thy vision: or, as some say,<br>\
in the space in which thou shalt open thine eye<br>\

one says, نَظَرَ فُلَانٌ بِطَرْفٍ خَفِىٍّ [Such a one<br>\
looked with a furtive glance], meaning, contracted<br>\
his eyelids over the main portion of his eye and<br>\
looked with the rest of it, by reason of shyness or<br>\
fear. (Har p. 565.) And تَطْرِفُ الرِّجَالَ [app.<br>\
meaning She looks at the men] is said of a woman<br>\
who does not keep constantly to one. (TA. [See<br>\
مَطْرُوفَةٌ.]) And تَطْرِفُ الرِّيَاضَ رَوْضَةً بَعْدَ رَوْضَةٍ<br>\
[app. meaning She looks at the meadows, meadow<br>\
after meadow, to pasture upon them in succession,] is said of a she-camel such as is termed<br>\
طَرِفَةٌ [q. v.]. (As, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  طَرَفْتُ عَيْنَهُ, (S, O,<br>\
Msb, in the K طَرَفَ عَيْنَهُ,) aor. and inf. n. as<br>\
above, (Msb, TA,) I (S, O, Msb) hit, struck,<br>\
smote, or hurt, his eye with a thing, (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K, [in the CK شَىْءٌ is put for بِشَىْءٍ,]) such as<br>\
a garment or some other thing, (TA,) so that it<br>\
shed tears: and one says of the eye, طُرِفَتْ. (S,<br>\
O, K. [See another explanation of the latter<br>\
in the first sentence.]) Ziyád, in reciting a<br>\
خُطْبَة, said, قَدْ طَرَفَتْ أَعْيُنَكُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَسَدَّتْ<br>\
مَسَامِعَكُمُ الشَّهَوَاتُ [The good of the present world<br>\
hath smitten your eyes, and appetences have<br>\
stopped your ears]. (O.) And one says طَرَفَهُ<br>\
and ↓ طرّفهُ meaning He, or it, struck, smote, or<br>\
hurt, his eye. (TA.) And طَرَفَهَا الحُزْنُ وَالبُكَآءُ<br>\
Grief and weeping hurt it (the eye), so that it<br>\
shed tears. (TA.) And طَرَفَهَا حُبُّ الرِّجَالِ The<br>\
love of the men smote her eye, so that she raised<br>\
her eyes and looked at every one that looked at<br>\
her; as though a طَرْفَة [or red spot of blood], or<br>\
a stick or the like, hurt her eye. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
الطَّرْفُ signifies also The slapping with the hand<br>\
(K, TA) upon the extremity of the eye. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  Then it became applied to signify The striking<br>\
upon the head. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  طَرَفَهُ عَنْهُ signifies He<br>\
turned him, or it, away, or back, from him, or it.<br>\
(S, O, K.) Hence the saying of a poet, (S, O,<br>\
TA,) &#39;Amr Ibn-Abee-Rabee&#39;ah, (TA,) or a<br>\
young woman of the Ansár, (O,)<br>\
إِنَّكَ وَاللّٰهِ لَذُو مَلَّةٍ<br>\
يَطْرِفُكَ الأَدْنَى عَنِ الأَبْعَدِ<br>\
so in the S; but the right reading is عَنِ الأَقْدَمِ,<br>\
for the next verse ends with تَصْرِمِى: (IB, TA:)<br>\
[i. e. Verily thou, by Alláh, art one having a<br>\
weariness: the nearer turns thee away, or back,<br>\
from the older:] meaning, he turns away, or<br>\
back, thy sight from the latter: i. e. thou takest<br>\
the new (الجَدِيدَ ↓ تَسْتَطْرِفُ), and forgettest the<br>\
old. (S, TA.) You say, طَرَفْتُ البَصَرَ عَنْهُ (S *<br>\
Msb) I turned away, or back, the sight from him,<br>\
or it. (Msb.) And اِطْرِفٌ بَصَرَكَ Turn away, or<br>\
back, thy sight from that upon which it has fallen<br>\
and to which it has been extended. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
And طَرَفَهُ عَنَّا شُغْلٌ Business, or occupation, withheld him from us. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And طَرَفَهُ He drove<br>\
him away. (Sh, TA.)<br>\

[aor.<br>\
طَرَفَ,] inf. n. طَرَفٌ; (TA;) and ↓ تطرّفت;<br>\
She (a camel) depastured the sides, or lateral<br>\
parts, (أَطْرَاف,) of the pasturage, not mixing with<br>\

It (property) was recently, or newly, acquired:<br>\

or new or fresh]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And the same verb,<br>\
(S, K,) inf. n. as above, (S, TA,) He was such<br>\
as is termed طَرِيفٌ [and طَرِفٌ q. v.] as meaning<br>\
the contr. of قُعْدُد. (S, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
طرّفهُ [from the subst. الطَّرْفُ meaning “ the<br>\

(S, O, K,) inf. n. تَطْرِيفٌ, (K,) He (a man, S, O)<br>\
fought around the army; because he charges<br>\
upon, or assaults, those who form the side, or<br>\
flank, or extreme portion, of it, (S, O, K,) and<br>\
drives them back upon the main body: (S, O:)<br>\
or, as in the M, he fought the most remote thereof,<br>\
and those that formed the side, or flank, thereof.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And طرّف عَلَىَّ الإِبِلَ He drove, or<br>\

extreme portions, of the camels. (O, K.) And<br>\
طرّف الخَيْلَ He drove back the foremost of the<br>\

of them. (TA.) Accord. to El-Mufaddal, تَطْرِيفٌ,<br>\
signifies a man&#39;s repelling another man from the<br>\
hindmost of his companions: (O, TA: *) one<br>\
says, طَرِّفْ عَنَّا هٰذَا الفَارِسَ [Repel thou from our<br>\
rear this horseman]. (O, TA.) ―<br>\

language is that of which the meanings are pointed,<br>\
and of which the constructions are crowned with<br>\
embellishments as though they were adorned with<br>\
شُرَف, pl. of شُرْفَةٌ, q. v.]. (TA: there mentioned immediately after what here next precedes<br>\

(TA. [See also 10.]) ―<br>\

in the S and O, as said of a رِدَآء of خَزّ.)<br>\
-A3-  اطرف<br>\
فُلَانًا He gave to such a one what he had not given<br>\
to any one before him: (L, K, * TA:) or he gave<br>\
him a thing of which he did not possess the like,<br>\

property newly, or recently, acquired.] You say,<br>\
أَطْرَفَهُ كَذَا and بِكَذَا, meaning أَتْحَفَهُ [He gave<br>\
him such a thing as a تُحْفَة, i. e. طُرْفَة, q. v.].<br>\

piece of information, (صَارُوا بِسَبَبِهِ ذَوِى طُرْفَةٍ,)<br>\
and said, مَا أَطْرَفَهُ [How novel and strange is<br>\
it!], by reason of their wonder at it; so that the<br>\
verb is intrans., and من is its agent: or it may<br>\

10.]<br>\
10<br>\
استطرفهُ He counted, accounted, reckoned,<br>\

being likened to the she-camel termed طَرِفَةٌ, that<br>\
depastures the extremities, or sides, of the pasturage, and tastes, and does not keep constantly<br>\
to one pasturage. (Har p. 569.) See also 1, last<br>\
quarter. ―<br>\
-b4-  And one says of camels, استطرنت<br>\
المَرْتَعَ They chose, or selected, the pasturage: or<br>\
they took the first thereof. (TA. [See also 2, last<br>\
signification but one.])<br>\
طَرْفٌ The eye; a word having no pl. in this<br>\
sense because it is originally an inf. n., (S, O, K,)<br>\
therefore it may denote a sing. and may also<br>\
denote a pl. number [i. e. may signify also eyes]:<br>\
(S, O, Msb:) or, (K,) as Ibn-&#39;Abbád says,<br>\
(O,) it is a coll. n. signifying the بَصَر [which<br>\
has the sing. and the pl. meanings mentioned<br>\
above, as well as the meaning of the sense of<br>\
sight], and is not dualized nor pluralized: or, as<br>\
some say, it has for pl. أَطْرَافٌ: (O, K:) but this<br>\
is refuted by the occurrence of طَرْف in a pl. sense<br>\
in the Kur xxxvii. 47 and xxxviii. 52 and lv. 56:<br>\
(O:) and though الأَطْرَاف is said to occur as its<br>\
pl. in a trad. of Umm-Selemeh, this is a mistake<br>\
for الإِطْرَاق: (Z, O:) it is said, however, that its<br>\
being originally an inf. n. is not a reason for its<br>\
not being allowable to pluralize it when it has<br>\
become a subst., and especially when it is not<br>\
meant to convey the signification of an epithet:<br>\
(MF:) [but it may be regarded as an epithet;<br>\
meaning seer, and, being originally an inf. n.,<br>\
seers also; and this is the more probable because]<br>\
↓ الطَّوَارِفُ [is an epithet used as a subst., and<br>\
thus] signifies the eyes, (S, O, K,) as in the<br>\
saying هُوَ بِمَكَانٍ لَا تَرَاهُ الطَّوَارِفُ [He is in a place<br>\
in which the eyes will not see him]; (S, * O, * TA;)<br>\
pl. of ↓ طَارِفَةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] الطَّرْفُ is the<br>\
name of (assumed tropical:)  Two stars, which precede الجَبْهَةُ, (S, O,<br>\
K,) so called because (K) they are [regarded as]<br>\
the two eyes of Leo; one of the Mansions of the<br>\
Moon: (S, O, K:) [often called الطَّرْفَةُ, q. v.:]<br>\
the طَرْف of Leo, consisting of two small stars in<br>\
front of الجَبْهَة, like the فَرْقَدَانِ, but inferior to<br>\
them in light, and having somewhat of obliquity;<br>\
the Ninth Mansion of the Moon: (Kzw in his<br>\
descr. of that Mansion:) or the star [app. lambda] in<br>\
the face of Leo, together with that which is outside [app. alpha] on the figure of Cancer: (Kzw in<br>\
his descr. of Leo:) or the bright star [alpha] on the<br>\
hinder, southern, leg, or foot, [i. e. claw,] of<br>\
Cancer. (Kzw in his descr. of Cancer.) [See<br>\
مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل.] ―<br>\

signifies The eyelid. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also طَرْفٌ, A<br>\
man generous, or noble, (K, TA, [see also طِرْفٌ,])<br>\
in respect of ancestry, up to the greatest [i. e. most<br>\
remote] forefather. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also طَرَفٌ,<br>\
first sentence.<br>\
طُرْفٌ: see طَرِيفٌ, with which it is syn., and<br>\
of which it is also a pl.<br>\
طِرْفٌ A generous horse: (As, S, O, K:) or,<br>\
accord. to Er-Rághib, one that is looked at<br>\
(يُطْرَفُ) because of his beauty; so that it is<br>\
originally مَطْرُوفٌ, i. e. مَنْظُورٌ; like نِقْضٌ in the<br>\
sense of مَنْقُوضٌ: (TA:) pl. طُرُوفٌ (As, S, O, K)<br>\
and أَطْرَافٌ: (O, K:) accord. to AZ, an epithet applied peculiarly to the males: (S, O, K: *)<br>\
or generous in respect of the sires and the dams:<br>\
(Lth, O, K:) or recently acquired; not of his<br>\
owner&#39;s breeding; fem. with ة, (O, K,) occurring<br>\
in a verse of El-&#39;Ajjáj: Lth says that they sometimes apply the epithets طِرْفٌ and طِرْفَةٌ as syn.<br>\
with نَجِيبٌ and نَجِيبَةٌ, in a manner unusual in<br>\
the language: (O:) accord. to Ks, طِرْفَةٌ is applied<br>\
as an epithet to a mare: (TA:) and طِرْفٌ signifies also a horse long in the legs or the neck,<br>\
having the ears pointed, tapering, or slender at<br>\
the extremities. (TA in the supplement to this<br>\
art.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (tropical:)  Generous (S, O, TA) as an epithet<br>\
applied to a young man (S, TA) or to a man;<br>\
(O, TA;) as also ↓ طَرَفٌ: (O, K:) or a man<br>\
generous in respect of his male and his female ancestors: (K, * TA:) pl. أَطْرَافٌ: (O, K:) when<br>\
applied to other than man, its pl. [or rather one<br>\
of its pls.] is طُرُوفٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also طَرَفٌ,<br>\
latter half. ―<br>\
-b4-  And رَجُلٌ طِرْفٌ فِى نَسَبِهِ, (K, TA,)<br>\
with kesr, (TA,) [in the CK, erroneously, طَرْفٌ,]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A man whose nobility is recent: as though a<br>\
contraction of ↓ طَرِفٌ. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And اِمْرَأَةٌ<br>\
طِرْفُ الحَدِيثِ, (K, TA,) with kesr, (TA,) [in the<br>\
CK طَرْف,] A woman whose discourse is good;<br>\
every one who has heard it esteeming it new<br>\

possessing everything that he sees. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also طَرِفٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  And see طَرِيفٌ.<br>\
-A3-<br>\
Also Anything of the produce of the earth still in<br>\
the calyxes thereof. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K, *)<br>\
طَرَفٌ The extremity, or end, of anything; [as<br>\
of a sword, and of a spear, and of a rope, and of<br>\
the tongue, &amp;c.;] thus accord. to ISd; but in<br>\
the K this meaning is assigned to ↓ طَرْفٌ: (TA:<br>\
[several evidences of the correctness of the former<br>\
word in this sense will be found in the present<br>\
art.; and countless instances of it occur in other<br>\
arts. &amp;c.: it seems to have been generally regarded by the lexicographers as too notorious to<br>\
need its being mentioned:]) and a side; a lateral,<br>\
or an outward, or adjacent, part or portion; a<br>\
region, district, quarter, or tract; syn. نَاحِيَةٌ:<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K:) and a part, portion, piece, or<br>\
bit, (syn. طَائِفَةٌ,) of a thing: (S, O, K:) it is<br>\
used in relation to bodies, or material things, and<br>\
to times &amp;c.; (Er-Rághib, TA;) and is thus<br>\
used in the sense of طَائِفَة of a people, in the Kur<br>\
iii. 122; (Ksh;) [and may often be rendered<br>\
somewhat of a thing, whether material (as land<br>\
&amp;c.) or not material (as in the T and S voce ذَرْوٌ,<br>\
where it is used of a saying, and as in the S and<br>\
A and K in art. هوس &amp;c., where it is used of<br>\
madness, or insanity, or diabolical possession):]<br>\
the pl. is أَطْرَافٌ. (O, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
الأَطْرَافُ signifies The fingers: and [when relating<br>\
to the fingers] has no sing. unless this is used as<br>\
a prefixed noun, as in the saying أَشَارَتْ بِطَرَفِ<br>\
إِصْبَعِهَا [She made a sign with the end of her<br>\
finger]: but the pl. is said by Az to be used in<br>\
the sense of the sing. in the following ex. cited<br>\
by Fr,<br>\
يُبْدِينَ أَطْرَافًا لِطَافًا عَنَيَهٌ<br>\
[so that the meaning is, They show an elegant<br>\
finger like a fruit of the species of tree called<br>\
عَنَم]; therefore the poet says عَمَنَه [which is a<br>\
n. un.: but I think that it is much more reasonable, and especially as the verb is pl., to regard<br>\
the ه in this case as the ه of pausation, of which<br>\
see an ex. voce حِينٌ; and accordingly to render<br>\
the saying, they show elegant fingers like fruits of<br>\
the عَنَم]. (TA.) It is said in a trad. of<br>\
Abraham, when he was a little child, جُعِلَ رِزْقُهُ<br>\
فِى أَطْرَافِهِ [His sustenance was made to be in his<br>\
fingers]; meaning that he used to suck his fingers<br>\
and find in them that which nourished him.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence] أَطْرَافُ العَذَارَى (tropical:)  A species<br>\
of grapes, (A, K, TA,) white and slender, found<br>\
at Et-Táïf: (A, TA:) or, as in the L, black<br>\
and long, resembling acorns, likened to the fingers<br>\
of virgins, that are dyed [with حِنَّآء], because of<br>\
their length; and the bunch of which is about a<br>\
cubit long. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  ذُو الطَّرَفَيْنِ is an appellation<br>\
of A sort of serpent, (K,) a sort of black serpent,<br>\
(TA,) or the [serpent called] أَسْوَد, (O,) having<br>\
two stings, one in its nose and the other in its tail,<br>\
with both of which, (O, K, TA,) so it is said, (O,<br>\
TA,) it smites, and it suffers not him whom it<br>\
smites to linger, killing at once. (O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
طَرَفَا الدَّابَّةِ sometimes means The fore part and<br>\
the hinder part of the beast. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And<br>\
أَطْرَافُ الجَسَدِ (O) or البَدَنِ (K) means [The extremities of the body; i. e.] the arms or hands,<br>\
and the legs or feet, and the head: (O, K:) or,<br>\
as in the L, أَطْرَافٌ is pl. of طَرَفٌ as syn. with<br>\
شَوَاةٌ [n. un. of شَوًى, q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [And the<br>\
dual has various other meanings assigned to it,<br>\
derived from the first of the significations mentioned in this paragraph.] It is said in a trad.<br>\
(O, K) of the Prophet, (O,) كَانَ إِذَا اشْتَكَى أَحَدٌ<br>\
مِنْ أَهْلِهِ لَمْ تَزَلِ البُرْمَةُ عَلَى النَّارِ حَتَّى يَأْتِىَ عَلَى<br>\
أَحَدِ طَرَفَيْهِ [It was the case that when any one of<br>\
his family had a complaint, the cooking-pot did<br>\
not cease to be on the fire but he arrived at one of<br>\
his two limits]; meaning (assumed tropical:)  convalescence or death;<br>\
because these are the two terminations of the case<br>\
of the diseased. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And one says, لَا<br>\
يَمْلِكُ طَرَفَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  He will not have control over his<br>\
mouth and his anus: referring to him who has<br>\
drunk medicine or become intoxicated. (AO,<br>\
ISk, S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And فُلَانٌ فَاسِدُ الطَّرَفِيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  Such<br>\
a one is corrupt in respect of the tongue and the<br>\
فَرْج. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  And لَا يَدْرِى أَىُّ طَرَفَيْهِ أَطْوَلُ,<br>\
(in the CK يُدْرَى,) [He will not, or does not,<br>\
know which of his two extremities is the longer,]<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  his ذَكَر and his tongue; (S, O, K,<br>\
TA;) whence طَرَفٌ is used as signifying (assumed tropical:)  the<br>\
tongue: (TA:) or the meaning is, as some say,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  which of his two halves is the longer; the lower<br>\
or the upper: (TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  the lineage of his<br>\
father or that of his mother (O, K, TA) in respect<br>\
of generosity, or nobility: (O, TA:) i. e., which<br>\
of his two parents is the more generous, or noble:<br>\
so says Fr. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  كَرِيمُ الطَّرَفَيْنِ means<br>\
(tropical:)  Generous, or noble, [on both sides, i. e.] in respect<br>\
of male and female ancestors. (S, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b12-<br>\
And أَطْرَافٌ means also (assumed tropical:)  A man&#39;s father and<br>\
mother and brothers and paternal uncles and any<br>\
relations whom it is unlawful for him to marry.<br>\
(AZ, S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b13-  And (assumed tropical:)  Noble, or exalted, men:<br>\
(Th, S:) or أَطْرَافُ الأَرْضِ means (tropical:)  the noble, or<br>\
exalted, men, and the learned men, of the earth,<br>\
or land: (O, K, TA:) one of whom is termed<br>\
طَرَفٌ, or ↓ طِرْفٌ. (O, See the latter of these<br>\
words.) And hence, as some explain it, the saying<br>\
in the Kur [xiii. 41, like one in xxi. 45], أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا<br>\
أَنَّا نَأْتِى الْأَرْضَ نَنْقُصُهَا مِنْ أَطْرَافِهَا (assumed tropical:)  [Have they not<br>\
seen that we visit, or bring destruction upon, the<br>\
land, curtailing it of its learned men?]; the<br>\
meaning being, the death of its learned men:<br>\
(O, TA:) or, as some say, [curtailing it of its<br>\
inhabitants and its fruits; for they say that] the<br>\
meaning is, the death of its inhabitants and the<br>\
diminution of its fruits: (TA:) or it means,<br>\
curtailing it of its sides, or districts, one by one:<br>\
(Az, O, L:) Ibn-&#39;Arafeh says that the meaning<br>\
is, we lay open by conquest, to the Prophet,<br>\
(نَفْتَحُ عَلَى النَّبِىِّ,) the country around Mekkeh.<br>\
(O, TA.) [―<br>\
-b14-  أَطْرَافُ النَّاسِ also means (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
lower orders of the people: but this I believe to<br>\
be post-classical.] ―<br>\
-b15-  طَرَفَىِ النَّهَارِ, in the Kur<br>\
xi. 116, means غُدْوَةً وَعَشِيَّةً [i. e. Morning and<br>\
afternoon]; by the former being meant daybreak; and by the latter, noon and the عَصْر<br>\
[q. v.], (Ksh, Bd,) or the عَصْر [only]. (Bd.)<br>\
And أَطْرَافَ النَّهَارِ, in the Kur xx. 130, means At<br>\
daybreak and at sunset: (Ksh, Bd:) or at noon<br>\
and at the عَصْر; so says Zj: or, accord. to IAar,<br>\
in the hours (سَاعَات) of the day: Abu-l-&#39;Abbás<br>\
says that it means طَرَفَىِ النَّهَارِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b16-  [عَلَى<br>\
طَرَفٍ often occurs as meaning Beside, aside, or<br>\
apart; like على جَانِبٍ, and على نَاحِيَةٍ: and in<br>\
like manner the Persians say بَرْ طَرَفْ. ―<br>\
-b17-  And<br>\
مِنْ طَرَفِ فُلَانٍ is often used as meaning On the<br>\
part of such a one; but is perhaps post-classical.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b18-  And you say, لِلْأَمْرِ طَرَفَانِ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  There<br>\
are two ways of performing the affair, either of<br>\
which may be chosen; as though it had two ends,<br>\
or two sides]. (TA voce صَرْعٌ.) And جَعَلَهُ<br>\
مُطْلَقَ الطَّرَفَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  [He made it allowable, or free,<br>\
in respect of both the alternatives, either way one<br>\
might choose to take]. (Msb in art. بوح.) ―<br>\
-b19-<br>\
[And hence, perhaps,] طَرَفٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  Anything chosen or choice: pl. أَطْرَافٌ: [whence]<br>\
أَطْرَافُ الحَدِيثِ means (assumed tropical:)  Chosen, or choice,<br>\
subjects of discourse; as also الحَدِيثِ ↓ طَرَائِفُ:<br>\
and أَطْرَافُ الأَحَادِيثِ means [the same, or] colloquies of friends, consisting of mutual communications, and oblique expressions, and allusions: so<br>\
says ISd: and this is likewise a meaning of<br>\
↓ الطِّرَافُ and السِّبَابُ, which latter [properly<br>\
signifying “ mutual reviling ”] is given in the K<br>\
as an explanation of the former. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b20-  Also<br>\
Flesh, or flesh-meat; syn. لَحْمٌ. (TA.)<br>\
طَرِفٌ, in the K ↓ طِرْف, but the former is the<br>\
right, (TA,) A male camel that removes from one<br>\
pasturage to another; (K, TA;) not keeping<br>\
constantly to one pasturage. (TA.) And طَرِفَةٌ A<br>\
she-camel that does not keep constantly to one<br>\
pasturage; (S, O, K;) that depastures the extremities, or sides, of the pasturage, and tastes,<br>\
and does not keep constantly to one pasturage:<br>\
(Har p. 569:) or, accord. to As, that looks at the<br>\
meadows (تَطْرِفُ الرِّيَاضَ), meadow after meadow<br>\
[app. to pasture upon them in succession]: (TA:)<br>\
and ↓ مُسْتَطْرِفَةٌ, so applied, signifies the same as<br>\
طَرِفَةٌ: (TA, but not as on the authority of As:)<br>\
and ↓ مِطْرَافٌ, so applied, that will not feed upon<br>\
a pasturage unless she choose anew, or take the<br>\
first of, (حَتَّى تَسْتَطْرِفَ,) another. (As, S, O, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence (see 10)] طَرِفٌ applied to a man<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  That does not keep constantly to a<br>\
wife, or woman, nor to a companion: (S, O, K:)<br>\
and ↓ طِرْف, thus accord. to the K, (TA, [in<br>\
which it is said that by rule it should be طَرِفٌ, as<br>\
above,]) a man who does not keep constantly to<br>\
the companionship of one person, by reason of his<br>\
weariness. (K.) And ↓ مُتَطَرِّفَةٌ applied to a<br>\
woman (assumed tropical:)  That chooses new ones of the men<br>\
(تَسْتَطْرِفُ الرِّجَالَ), not keeping constantly to a<br>\
husband; as being likened to the she-camel<br>\
termed طَرِفَةٌ. (Har p. 569.)<br>\
-A2-  And طَرِفٌ,<br>\
applied to a she-camel, (O, K, [but in some of<br>\
the copies of the latter, where it follows next<br>\
after another explanation of the epithet thus<br>\
applied, mentioned above, “or,”]) accord. to<br>\
IAar, Whose fore part of the head has gradually<br>\
shed its hair (الَّتِى تَحَاتَّ مُقَدَّمُ الرَّأْسِ فِيهَا, O) or<br>\
whose fore part of her mouth has shed its teeth<br>\
one after another (التى تَحَاتَّ مُقَدَّمُ فِيهَا, K) by<br>\
reason of extreme age. (O, K. [See 2, last<br>\
sentence.])<br>\
-A3-  Also, and ↓ طَريفٌ (assumed tropical:)  Contr. of قُعْدُدٌ;<br>\
(S, M, K, TA;) i. e., as the latter is further expl.<br>\
in the S, and each in the M, having many<br>\
ancestors, up to the greatest [i. e. most remote]<br>\
forefather; and J adds that sometimes it is used<br>\
in praise: thus also As explains النَّسَبِ ↓ طَرِيفُ:<br>\
accord. to IAar, طَرِيفٌ signifies منحدر فى<br>\
النَّسَبِ [app. مُنْحَدِرٌ, as though meaning of long<br>\
descent]; and he says that it is with the Arabs<br>\
more noble than قُعْدُدٌ: the pl. of طَرِفٌ as meaning the contr. of قُعْدُدٌ is طَرِفُونَ; and the pl. of<br>\
↓ طَرِيفٌ in the same sense is طُرُفٌ and طُرَفٌ and<br>\
طُرَّافٌ, the second and third of which pls. are<br>\
anomalous. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [طَرِفٌ seems also to have<br>\
the contr. meaning; or (assumed tropical:)  One whose nobility is<br>\
recent: and the like is said of قُعْدُدٌ; that it has<br>\
two contr. meanings:] see طِرْفٌ.<br>\
طَرْفَةٌ [A wink, i. e.] a closing of one of the<br>\
eyelids upon the other: (S, O, K:) or [a twinkling<br>\
of the eye, i. e.] a putting the eyelids in motion or<br>\
in a state of commotion. (K.) One says أَسْرَعُ<br>\
مِنْ طَرْفَةِ عَيْنٍ [Quicker than a wink, or a twinkling of an eye]. (S, O.) And مَا يُفَارِقُنِى طَرْفَةَ<br>\
عَيْنٍ [He does not separate himself from me<br>\
during a wink, or a twinkling of an eye]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also A red spot of blood, in the eye, occasioned<br>\
by a blow or some other cause. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And A brand, or mark made with a hot iron,<br>\
having to it no أَطْرَاف [or sides, or lateral portions], being only a line. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  And الطَّرْفَةُ A certain star or asterism (نَجْمٌ).<br>\
(K. [There thus mentioned as though different<br>\
from the asterism commonly called الطَّرْفُ, which<br>\
I do not believe to be the case: see the latter<br>\
appellation.])<br>\
طُرْفَةٌ A hurt of the eye, occasioning its shedding<br>\
tears. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  And Newly-acquired property;<br>\
(S, O, K;) anything that one has newly acquired,<br>\
and that pleases him; as also ↓ أُطْرُوفَةٌ; (TA;)<br>\
a thing newly acquired; (Har p. 54;) and a<br>\
thing that is strange and deemed good; (Id. p.<br>\
615;) [a pleasing rarity;] a welcome, or pleasing,<br>\
thing; (KL;) and a gift not given to any one<br>\
before; (K, * TA;) and a gift of which the<br>\
recipient did not possess the like, and which pleases<br>\
him; (TA;) [generally, a novel, or rare, and<br>\
pleasing, present; like تُرْفَةٌ and تُحْفَةٌ:] pl. طُرَفٌ.<br>\
(Har p. 32.) [See also طَرِيفٌ and طَرِيفَةٌ.]<br>\
طَرَفَةٌ A single tree of the species called طَرْفَآء,<br>\
q. v. (AHn, S, O, K.)<br>\
طُرْفَى Remoteness in lineage from the [chief, or<br>\

TA.) [See طَرِفٌ.]<br>\
طَرْفَآء [accord. to some طَرْفَآءٌ and accord. to<br>\
others طَرْفَآءُ, as will be seen from what follows,]<br>\
A kind of trees, (S, O, K,) of which there are<br>\
four species, one of these being the أَثْل [q. v.]:<br>\
(K:) [or it is different from the أَثْل: the name<br>\

(Forskål&#39;s Flora Aegypt. Arab. p. lxiv. no. 181;<br>\
and Delile&#39;s Floræ Aegypt. Illustr. no. 349:)]<br>\
AHn says, it is of the kind called عِضَاه; its هَدَب<br>\
[q. v.] are like those of the أَثْل; it has no wood<br>\
fit for carpentry, coming forth only as even and<br>\
smooth rods towards the sky; and sometimes the<br>\
camels eat it as حَمْض [q. v.] when they find no<br>\
other حَمْض: AA, he adds, says that it is a sort<br>\
of حَمْض: (TA:) the n. un. is ↓ طَرَفَةٌ, (AHn,<br>\
S, O, K,) [which is irreg.,] and طَرْفَآءَةٌ, (AHn,<br>\
O, K, [in the CK, erroneously, طَرْفَاةٌ,]) [and this<br>\
requires طَرْفَآء to be with tenween, as a coll.<br>\
gen. n.,] or, accord. to Sb, طَرْفَآء is sing. and pl.:<br>\
(S, O:) or it is a pl. [or quasi-pl. n.] of طَرَفَةٌ,<br>\
like as شَجْرَآءُ is of شَجَرَةٌ: (S in art. شجر: [see<br>\
شَجَرٌ:]) or it is coll. gen. n.: accord. to IJ,<br>\
the ء in طَرْفَآء is a denotative of the fem. gender;<br>\
but in طَرْفَآءَةٌ, the ة is a denotative of the fem.<br>\
gender, and the ء is augmentative. (M, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also A place of growth of the طَرَفَة. (TA.)<br>\
طِرَافٌ The portion that is taken [app. meaning<br>\

applied to an eye signifies the same as مَطْرُوفَةٌ<br>\

its meaning in the saying of Tarafeh,<br>\
إِذَا نَحْنُ قُلْنَا أَسْمِعِينَا انْبَرَتْ لَنَا<br>\
عَلَى رِسْلِهَا مَطْرُوفَةً لَمْ تَشَدَّد<br>\
(O, EM,) i. e. When we say, “Sing thou to us,”<br>\
she betakes herself to us in her gentle way, as<br>\
though her eye were hurt by something, by reason<br>\
of the languish of her look, not straining herself<br>\
in her singing; but as some relate the verse, the<br>\
word is مَطْرُوقَةً, meaning “ weakly: ” (EM:)<br>\
or it means whose eye the love of men has smitten,<br>\
so that she raises her eyes and looks at every one<br>\
that looks at her; as though a طَرْفَة [or red spot<br>\
of blood], or a stick or the like, hurt her eye:<br>\
(Az, TA:) or having a languishing eye; as though<br>\
it were turned away, or back, (طُرِفَتٌ,) from<br>\

as though her eye were turned away, or back so<br>\
that it, or she, is still: (TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  who looks at<br>\
the men (تَطْرِفُ الرِّجَالَ); i. e. (assumed tropical:)  who does not keep<br>\
constantly to one; the pass. part. n. being put in<br>\
the place of the act.; but Az says that this explanation is at variance with the original purport<br>\
of the word: (TA:) or مَطْرُوفَةٌ بِالرِّجَال means<br>\
(tropical:)  a woman who raises, or stretches and raises, her<br>\
eye at men, (S, O, K, TA,) and turns away her<br>\

in whom is no good: (TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  who looks not at<br>\
any but the men; (K;) or مَطْرُوفَةُ العَيْنِ بِالرِّجَالِ<br>\
has this meaning. (AA, TA.)<br>\
