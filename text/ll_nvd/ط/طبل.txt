طَبَّلَ see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
طَبْلٌ [A drum;] a certain thing with which<br>\
one beats, (S, O, K,) [or rather upon which one<br>\
beats,] well known, (Msb,) having a single face,<br>\
and having two faces: (Msb, K:) pl. [of mult.]<br>\
طُبُولٌ (O, Msb, K) and [of pauc.] أَطْبَالٌ. (Msb,<br>\
K.) [Hence] one says, هُوَ طَبْلٌ ذُو وَجْهَيْنِ [lit.<br>\
He is a double-faced drum]; meaning (tropical:)  he is of<br>\
ill-omened, or hard, aspect. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ<br>\
يَضْرِبُ الطَّبْلَ تَحْتَ الكِسَآءِ [lit. Such a one beats the<br>\
drum beneath the garment called كساء; meaning,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  strives to conceal what is notorious: similar<br>\
to the Pers. saying طَبْل دَرْ زِيرِ گِلِيم زَدَنْ]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also A رَبْعَة [or small round basket, covered<br>\
with leather,] for perfumes. (TA.) And A سَلَّة<br>\
[or round basket] for food, [app. shallow, resembling a round tray, for it is said to be] like<br>\
the خِوَان; also called ↓ طَبْلِيَّةٌ, of which the pl.<br>\
is طَبَالٍ. (TA. [See also سَدٌّ, last sentence.])<br>\
[And A kind of tray, of wood, used for counting<br>\
money, &amp;c.; also called ↓ طَبْلَةٌ: this is app. what<br>\
is meant by the saying in the S, طَبْلُ الدَّرَاهِمِ<br>\
وَغَيْرِهَا مَعْرُوفٌ; and by the saying in the O, طَبْلَةُ<br>\
الدَّارَهِمِ مَعْرُوفٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And A certain sort of garments, or cloths, (Lth, IDrd, O, K, *) upon<br>\
which is the form of the طَبْل [or drum], (Lth, O,<br>\
K,) or figured with the like of طُبُول [or drums],<br>\
(T, TA,) of the fabric of El-Yemen, or of Egypt,<br>\
(K,) or brought from Egypt, and called also<br>\
↓ الطَّبْلِيَّةُ and أَرْدِيَةُ الطَّبْلِ: (Lth, O:) which last<br>\
appellation is expl. in the A as meaning [garments of the kind called] بُرُود, worn by the lords,<br>\
or principal personages, of Egypt. (TA.) ―<br>\

And The [tax called] خَرَاج: (IAar, O, K:)<br>\
[or an instalment thereof; for] one says, أَدَّى<br>\
أَهْلُ مِصْرَ طَبْلًا مِنَ الخَرَاجِ and طَبْلَيْنِ and طُبُولًا<br>\
The people of Egypt payed an instalment of the<br>\
خراج [and two instalments and several instalments]; so called after the طَبْل [or drum] of the<br>\
بُنْدَار [app. meaning the farmer-general of the tax,<br>\
who, it seems from this, announced his coming<br>\
by the beating of a drum]: (A, TA:) [and probably syn. with خَرَاجٌ as meaning revenue in a<br>\
general sense; for it is added,] hence [the saying]<br>\
↓ هُوَ يُحِبُّ الطَّبْلِيَّةَ (O, K [in the CK تَحْتَ is<br>\
erroneously put for يُحِبُّ]) i. e. He loves the<br>\
خَرَاج, (O,) or the money of the خَرَاج, (K,) without fatigue. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  الطَّبْلُ signifies also الخَلْقُ<br>\
and النَّاسُ [i. e. The created beings in general and<br>\
mankind in particular]: one says, مَا أَدْرِى أَىُّ<br>\
الطَّبْلِ هُوَ i. e. [I know not] what one of mankind<br>\
he is: (S, O:) and so أَىُّ الطَّبْنِ هُوَ. (TA.)<br>\
طَبْلَةٌ [A wooden tray; generally round: like<br>\
طَلْبَهٌ in Persian. And such is app. meant by<br>\
what here follows:] A certain thing of wood,<br>\
which women take for their use. (TA.) See<br>\
also طَبْلٌ.<br>\
طَبْلِيَّةٌ: see طَبْلٌ, in three places.<br>\
طِبَالَةٌ The art, or occupation, of beating the<br>\
طبْل [or drum]. (Msb, K.)<br>\
طَبَّالٌ [A drummer;] a beater of the طَبْل.<br>\
(O, K. *)<br>\
طَبَّالَةٌ [fem. of طَبَّالٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and] i. q. طُوبَالَةٌ, q. v.<br>\
طُوبَالَةٌ A ewe; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ طَبَّالَةٌ:<br>\
(TA:) pl. of the former طُوبَالَاتٌ: a ram is not<br>\
to be called طُوبَالٌ. (S, K.) Tarafeh says,<br>\
نَعَانِى حَنَانَةُ طُوبَالَةً<br>\
تَسَفُّ يَبِسًا مِنَ العِشْرِقِ<br>\
[Hanáneh announced to me death (app. meaning<br>\
predicted my death, for otherwise it should be<br>\
نَعَى لِى): a ewe that eats dry &#39;ishrik]: (S, O,<br>\
TA:) [in explanation of which it is said,] نَعَانِى<br>\
means أَخْبَرَنِى بِالمَوْتِ: and حَنَانَة is the name of<br>\
a pastor: and طوبالة is put in the accus. case as<br>\
a term of revilement, as though the poet said<br>\
أَعْنِى طُوبَالَةً. (TA.)<br>\
