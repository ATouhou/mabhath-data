(K;) and طَبَاهُ, aor. يَطْبِيهِ, (S, TA,) inf. n. طَبْىٌ;<br>\
(TA in art. طبى;) He called him: (S, K:) or,<br>\
accord. to Sh, he called him with a gentle calling:<br>\
(TA:) an ex. of the latter verb occurs in a verse<br>\
of Dhu-r-Rummeh cited voce ضَارِبٌ, (S,) or, as<br>\
Lh cited that verse, an ex. of the former verb:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ اِطَّبَاهُ, (Sh, S, K, [in the CK<br>\
erroneously written اَطْبَاهُ,]) of the measure اِفْتَعَلَهُ,<br>\
(S,) signifies the same. (Sh, S, K.) And [hence]<br>\
one says, لاَ أَدْرِى مِنْ أَيْنَ اطبيت, [a mistranscription for طُبِيتَ,] with damm, and اطّبيت, [i. e.<br>\
↓ اطُّبِيتَ,] meaning [I know not whence thou hast<br>\
been called; or] whence thou hast come. (TA in<br>\
art. طبى.)<br>\

-b2-  One says also<br>\
اِطَّبَى بَنُو فُلَانٍ فُلَانًا, (S, K, TA, [in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, اَطْبَى,]) The sons of such a one<br>\
associated as friends with such a one and slew<br>\
him: (S, K, TA:) and اِطَّبَيْتُهُ I acted with him<br>\
as a friend, then I slew him. (IKtt, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
اِطَّبَى القُلُوبَ, in a trad. of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr, means<br>\
He showed love, or affection, to the hearts [of<br>\
others], and drew them near to him. (TA.)<br>\
And اِطَّبَاهُ signifies also He attracted him to<br>\
himself; or sought to make him incline. (TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
طباة (thus written without any vowel-sign) is<br>\
said in the TA, in art. طبى, to signify أَحْمَقُ (i. e.<br>\
Stupid, &amp;c.): but I think it probable that this is<br>\
from a mistranscription for ظَبْأَةٌ, properly meaning “ a hyena; ” a beast proverbial for stupidity:<br>\
see ضَبُعٌ.]<br>\
