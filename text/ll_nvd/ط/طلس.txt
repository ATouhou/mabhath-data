(M:) or he obliterated it, or effaced it, namely<br>\

put on, or made use of, a napkin as a طيلسان:<br>\
(see De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed., vol. iii.,<br>\

(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TS, O, TA:) أَمْرُهُ, in the copies of<br>\

طَيْلَسَانٌ (El-Fárábee, S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K)<br>\
and طَيْلِسَانٌ, (M, O, K,) the latter form used by<br>\
some, (El-Fárábee, Msb,) or by the vulgar, (S,)<br>\
and disallowed by As, (M, Msb,) and طَيْلُسَانٌ,<br>\
all these three forms being mentioned by &#39;Iyád<br>\
and others, (K,) [accord. to the TA, following<br>\
Lth; but the words of Lth, as cited in the TA,<br>\
and in the O, rather signify that, if, instead of<br>\
طَيْلِسَانٌ, with kesr to the ل, one said طَيْلُسَانٌ,<br>\
with damm to the ل, like خَيْزُرَانٌ and حَيْسُمَانٌ,<br>\
it would be more agreeable with analogy; and<br>\
the like is said in the Msb, as on the authority of<br>\
Az;] and ↓ طَيْلَسٌ (M, Mgh, O, K) and<br>\
↓ طَالَسَانٌ; (M, TA;) arabicized words, (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) from the Pers., (S, Msb,) originally<br>\
تَالَسَانْ, (as in some copies of the K,) or تَالَشَانْ;<br>\
(as in other copies of the K, and in some copies<br>\
of the T, and thus written by El-Urmawee, as is<br>\
said in the TA, and thus written also in the<br>\
Mgh;) differently expl. by different persons;<br>\
(TA;) [app. accord. to the fashions of different<br>\
times and countries;] accord. to some, (TA,) A<br>\
certain kind of كِسَآء: (M, TA:) or a certain<br>\
article of apparel worn by the عَجَم [Persians or<br>\
other foreigners], (Mgh, Msb,) of a round form,<br>\
and black; accord. to the “ Jema et-Tefáreek,”<br>\
having its woof and warp both of wool: (Mgh:)<br>\
or a كِسَآء, of a dark, or an ashy, dust-colour,<br>\
(أَخْضَر,) worn by persons of distinction: (EshShereeshee, in Har, p. 238:) [see also بَتٌّ, and<br>\
سَاجٌ: El-Makreezee mentions a kind of طيلسان<br>\
having a round piece cut out from the middle of<br>\
it (مُقَوَّرٌ) worn by the Egyptian Wezeer, and<br>\
called, in his time, (the 14th and 15th centuries<br>\
of our era,) طَرْحَةٌ: (see this word: and see De<br>\
Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed., ii. 267—269; and<br>\
Dozy&#39;s Dict. des Noms des Vêtements chez les<br>\
Arabes, 278—90:) it seems to have resembled<br>\
our academic hood, of which it was perhaps the<br>\
original: the term طيلسان is now commonly<br>\
applied to an oblong piece of drapery, or a scarf,<br>\
or an oblong shawl, worn in such a manner that<br>\
one end hangs down upon the side of the bosom,<br>\
the middle part being turned over the head and<br>\
under the chin, and the other end being thrown<br>\
over the shoulder, and hanging down upon the<br>\
back: this is worn by many of the professional<br>\
learned men in winter, in Arabian countries: it<br>\
is also used in the sense of the word عَذَبَةٌ,<br>\
meaning an end of a turban, when made to hang<br>\
down between the shoulders: see عَذَبٌ:] the pl.<br>\
(of طَيْلَسَانٌ and طَيْلِسَانٌ and طَيْلَسٌ, M) is طَيَالِسَةٌ,<br>\
(S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) in which the ة is<br>\
added because it is a foreign word, (S, M, K,)<br>\
and طَيَالِسُ; (M, A;) or the latter is pl. of<br>\
طَيْلَسٌ: (TA:) I do not know (says ISd) any<br>\
pl. of طَالَسَانٌ: (M, TA:) it is not allowable to<br>\
form an abbreviation of طَيْلِسَانٌ, with kesr to the<br>\
ل, as a compellation, because there is no instance<br>\
of the measure فَيْعِلٌ, with kesr to the ع,<br>\
except in infirm words such as سَيِّدٌ and مَيِّتٌ.<br>\
(S.) Hence the expression, (Mgh,) يَا ابْنَ<br>\
الطَّيْلَسَانِ, [lit., O son of the teylesán,] meaning,<br>\
O &#39;Ajamee, (A, Mgh,) or Aajamee, (K,) [i. e.,<br>\
Persian, or foreigner,] used in reviling another;<br>\
(Mgh, K;) for the عَجَم are those who [most<br>\
commonly] attire themselves with the طيلسان.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also طَلْسٌ.<br>\
أَطْلَسُ Old and worn-out; (S, M, K;) applied<br>\
to a garment, or piece of cloth: (M, K:) as also<br>\
↓ طِلْسٌ; pl. أَطْلَاسٌ. (S.) You say, رَجُلٌ أَطْلَسُ<br>\
الثَّوْبِ A man whose garment is old and worn-out.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A dirhem [of which the impression is obliterated;] having no impression. (Msb, voce<br>\
مَسِيحٌ.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A wolf whose hair has fallen off by<br>\
degrees; (Az, TA;) as also ↓ طِلْسٌ: (IAar, A,<br>\
K:) or a wolf of a dusty colour inclining to<br>\
blackness; (S, M, A, K;) and anything of that<br>\
colour; (S, K;) whether a garment or any other<br>\
thing: (TA:) fem. طَلْسَآءُ: (M:) pl. طُلْسٌ. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  A man having little hair upon the side of the<br>\
cheek; pl. طُلْسٌ: or i. q. كَوْسَجٌ [q. v.]: of the<br>\
the dial. of El-Yemen. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Dirty, or<br>\
filthy; as also ↓ طِلْسٌ: (K:) the latter applied<br>\
to a garment, or piece of cloth, (K, TA,) in the<br>\
colour of which is a dusty hue: (TA:) and طَلْسَآءُ<br>\
a dirty rag. (O.) ―<br>\
-b6-  A man (tropical:)  dirty, or filthy,<br>\
in apparel: likened to a wolf in respect of the<br>\
dusty hue of his clothes: (M:) or black and<br>\
dirty. (O.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A man who is accused<br>\
of foul, or evil, conduct; (Sh, O, K;) and so<br>\
أَطْلَسُ الثَّوْبَيْنِ, an expression used by Ows Ibn-<br>\
Hajar. (Sh, O.) ―<br>\
-b8-  (tropical:)  Black, as an Abyssinian<br>\
and the like: (O, K:) as being likened in colour<br>\
to a wolf. (TA.) [See also طَلْسٌ.] ―<br>\
-b9-  (tropical:)  A<br>\
thief: (O, K:) because of his evil nature, (TA,)<br>\
being likened to a wolf. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [Satin;<br>\
so called in the present day;] a garment, or piece<br>\
of cloth, of woven silk: [app. because of its<br>\
smoothness:] but this is not [of the classical]<br>\
Arabic: pl. طُلْسٌ. (TA.)<br>\
