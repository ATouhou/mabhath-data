طَفِقَ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا, (S, Mgh, O, K,) aor.<br>\
طَفَقَ;<br>\
(S, K;) and طَفَقَ, aor.<br>\
طَفِقَ, (S, O, K,) mentioned<br>\
by Akh, (S, ISd, O,) and by Zj, (ISd, TA,) as<br>\
said by some, (S, O,) but pronounced by Lth to<br>\
be bad; (TA;) inf. n. طَقَقٌ, (S, K, TA, [in some<br>\
copies of the K, erroneously, طَفْقٌ,]) of the<br>\
former verb; (S, TA;) and طُفُوقٌ, (S, O, K,) of<br>\
the latter verb; (S, O;) He set about, began,<br>\
commenced, took to, or betook himself to, doing<br>\
such a thing: (S, Mgh, O, TA:) expl. in the K<br>\
as meaning he continued uninterruptedly the doing<br>\
of such a thing (وَاصَلَ الفِعْلَ [or in some copies<br>\
وَصَلَ الفِعْلَ]), and by El-Háfidh Ibn-Hajar, in<br>\
the “ Fet-h el-Bári,” as meaning he entered upon,<br>\
began, or commenced, and went on continually,<br>\
doing such a thing; but it denotes the entering<br>\
upon the doing of a thing irrespectively of the<br>\
going on continually or not, and therefore it is<br>\
not allowable to prefix أَنْ to its predicate: (MF,<br>\
TA:) it is followed by a future [or an aor., as in<br>\
the ex. above]: the saying فَطَفِقَ مَسْحًا بِالسُّوقِ<br>\
وَالْأَعْنَاقِ, in the Kur [xxxviii. 32], (TA,) i. e.<br>\
He took to severing with the sword [the thighs<br>\
and the necks], or, as some say, to wiping [or<br>\
stroking] with his hand [the thighs and the necks],<br>\
(Bd,) is for طَفِقَ يَمْسَحُ مَسْحًا: (Bd, * TA:) the<br>\
verb is used only in an affirmative phrase: they<br>\
do not say مَا طَفِقَ. (IDrd, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  طَفِقَ فُلَانٌ<br>\
بِمَا أَرَادَ, (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, O, K, *) a phrase of the<br>\
Arabs of the desert, (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, O,) means<br>\
Such a one attained that which he desired.<br>\
(Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, O, K. *) ―<br>\
-b3-  And one says طَفِقَ<br>\
المَوْضِعَ, aor.<br>\
طَفَقَ, He kept, or clave, to the place.<br>\
(ISd, K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اطفقهُ اللّٰهُ بِهِ God caused him to attain him,<br>\
or it. (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, O, K.) One says, لَئِنْ<br>\
أَطْفَقَنِى اللّٰهُ بِهِ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ بِهِ [Verily if God cause me<br>\
to attain him, or it, I will assuredly do something with him, or it]. (TA.)<br>\
