طَلَّتِ السَّمَآءُ الأَرْضَ, [aor.<br>\
طَلُ3َ,] inf. n. طَلٌّ,<br>\
The sky rained small rain upon the earth, or land.<br>\
(MA.) And طُلَّتِ الأَرْضُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. as<br>\
above, (TA,) [meaning, as is implied in the S<br>\
and O, The earth, or land, was rained upon by the<br>\
weakest of rain; or was rained upon, or bedewed,<br>\
by the طَلّ, q. v.; or] the طَلّ descended upon the<br>\
earth, or land: (K:) and طَلَّهَا النَّدَى [The rain,<br>\
or dew, moistened it]: (S, O, TA:) and طَلَّت,<br>\
with fet-h, signifies [accord. to some] It became<br>\
moist, or moistened: one says, طُلَّتْ بِلَادُكَ, and<br>\
طَلَّتْ; the former meaning May thy countries,<br>\
or tracts of country, be rained upon; and the<br>\
latter, become moist, or moistened: or, accord. to<br>\
Aboo-Is-hák, [i. e. Zj,] طُلَّتْ only, with damm;<br>\
[and he adds,] one says, رَحُبَتْ بِلَادُكَ وَطُلَّتْ, with<br>\
damm, [i. e. May thy tracts of country be spacious<br>\
to thee, and be moistened by the طَلّ, (or, as in<br>\
art. رحب in the TA, أَرْحَبَتْ عَلَيْكَ وَطُلَّتْ)], not<br>\
طَلَّتْ; because the طَلّ is not from them, [i. e.<br>\
it is not from the tracts of country,] but they are<br>\
the objects thereof. (TA.) [Golius mentions,<br>\
among the significations of طَلَّ, as on the<br>\
authority of Z, i. q. رحب, said of land, or the<br>\
earth, and followed by على relating to a person:<br>\
but I think it most probable that he inferred this<br>\
signification from his finding, in a copy of the A,<br>\
the phrase رَحُبَتْ عَلَيْكَ الأَرْصُ وَطَلَّتْ (for وَطُلَّتْ),<br>\
without any explanation. And Freytag mentions<br>\
↓ أُطِلَّ as meaning It was watered by fine rain;<br>\
from the Deewán of the Hudhalees.] And [it is<br>\
said that] طَلَّتِ السَّمَآءُ signifies اِشْتَدَّ وَقْعُهَا [i. e.<br>\
The rain fell vehemently]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  طَلَّ دَمَهُ,<br>\
(AZ, S, O, Msb,) said of God, (S,) or of the<br>\
ruling power, (Msb,) first pers. طَلَلْتُهُ, (K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
طَلُ3َ, (Msb,) inf. n. طَلٌّ (Msb, K) and طُلُولٌ,<br>\
(K,) He made his blood to go for nought, unretaliated, and uncompensated by a mulct; made it<br>\
to be of no account: (AZ, S, O, Msb, K, TA:)<br>\
or held it to be of little account, as though it were<br>\
but [the rain, or dew, termed] طَلّ, in its result;<br>\
this, accord. to Er-Rághib, being the proper<br>\
meaning: (TA:) and ↓ اطلّهُ signifies the same.<br>\
(AZ, S, O, Msb, K.) And طُلَّ دَمُهُ His blood<br>\
was made to go for nought, &amp;c.; (AZ, S, Mgh,<br>\
O, Msb, K;) as also دَمُهُ ↓ أُطِلَّ: (AZ, S, O,<br>\

طَلِ3َ [agreeably with<br>\
analogy]; (K;) and طَلَّ, originally طَلِلَ, (Msb,<br>\
K, *) aor.<br>\
طَلَ3َ; (Msb, K;) [his blood went for<br>\
nought, &amp;c.;] but this is disallowed by AZ; (S,<br>\
O, Msb;) and it is more commonly with damm.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And طَلَّهُ حَقَّهُ, aor.<br>\
طَلُ3َ, He diminished,<br>\
or impaired, to him his right, or due; or deprived,<br>\
or defrauded him of it, partly, or wholly: (K,<br>\
TA:) or, accord. to Khálid Ibn-Jembeh, (TA,)<br>\
he denied him, or refused him, his right, or due; (K,<br>\
TA;) and withheld it [from him]: (TA:) and he<br>\
annulled it; or made it to go for nought, as a<br>\
thing of no account, or as a thing that had perished<br>\
or become lost. (K, TA.) You say, طَلُّوا فُلَانًا<br>\
حَقَّهُ, aor.<br>\
طَلُ3َ, inf. n. طَلٌّ, They denied, or refused,<br>\
such a one his right, or due: so says Khálid Ibn-Jembeh. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And طَلَّ غَرِيمَهُ, (K,) aor.<br>\
طَلُ3َ,<br>\
(TA,) inf. n. طَلٌّ, (O, K,) He delayed, or deferred,<br>\
with his creditor, or put him off, by promising<br>\

طَلَ3َ,] inf. n. طَلَالَةٌ;<br>\
like مَلَّ, [sec. pers. مَلِلْتَ, aor.<br>\
طَلَ3َ,] (K, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. مَلَالَةٌ; (TA;) [accord. to Freytag, followed by لَهُ, and in the Deewán of the Hudhalees<br>\
by إِلَيْهِ; and so, accord. to him, ↓ استطلّ, followed<br>\
by لَهُ;] He, or it, was, or became, pleasing, (K,<br>\
TA,) and goodly. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  And طَلَّهُ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. طَلٌّ, (TA,) is also syn. with طَلَاهُ: (K:)<br>\
so in the phrase طَلَّهُ بِالوَرْسِ [He smeared it, or<br>\
rubbed it over, with ورس, q. v.]; namely, a<br>\
thing. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.)<br>\

-A3-  اطلّ عَلَيْهِ He (a man,<br>\
Msb) looked upon it, looked upon it from above,<br>\

syn. أَشْرَفَ, (S, O, K,) [i. e.] أَشْرَفَ عَلَيْهِ, (Msb,)<br>\
or أَوْفَى عليه; (Ham p. 208;) properly أَوْفَى<br>\
عَلَيْهِ بِطَلَلِهِ, i. e. بِشَخْصِهِ [meaning he looked upon<br>\
it, &amp;c., with his body; not in imagination]; (Er-Rághib, TA;) and ↓ استطلّ signifies the same:<br>\
(K:) and so أَطَفَّ عليه. (O in art. طف.) [See<br>\
also 6.] Hence, in a trad., the saying of Safeeyeh<br>\
the daughter of &#39;Abd-El-Muttalib, فَأَطَلَّ عَلَيْنَا<br>\
يَهُودِىٌّ فَقُمْتُ فَضَرَبْتُ رَأْسَهُ بِالسَّيْفِ ثُمَّ رَمَيْتُ بِهِ<br>\
عَلَيْهِمْ [And a Jew looked upon us, and I arose,<br>\
and smote off his head with the sword, then cast<br>\
it upon them]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, perhaps,] اطلّ<br>\

And اطلّ عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  He importuned him, (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, O, TA,) حَتَّى غَلَبَهُ [so that, or until, he<br>\

فُلَانٍ بِالأَذَى (assumed tropical:)  Such a one kept continually, or<br>\
constantly, to the annoying, or molesting, or hurting, of such a one. (TA.)<br>\

وَأَحْلَاهُ [How pleasing is the poetry of Jemeel, and<br>\
how sweet is it!]. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
هٰذِهِ الأَرْضُ قَدْ تَطَلَّلَتْ This land has produced herbage, and become replete, [for تَخَيَّرَتْ<br>\
(to which I cannot assign any apposite meaning),<br>\
in my original, I read تَحَيَّرَتْ,] and has not been<br>\
trodden by any one: so says AA. (O.)<br>\

my toes, and stretched my stature, to look at a<br>\
thing, (تَطَاوَلْتُ, K, TA, both of these verbs<br>\
meaning thus, TA in art. طول,) and looked: (K,<br>\
TA:) or, accord. to AA, التَّطَالُّ signifies the<br>\
looking from above a place, or from a curtain or<br>\
the like. (TA.) [See an ex. in a verse cited in<br>\
art. شرف, conj. 10: and see also 4 in the present<br>\
art.]<br>\

السَّمَآءِ [app. meaning The horse went along raising<br>\
his tail toward the sky: for I think that إِذَا نَاصَبَهُ<br>\
should be إِذَا كَانَ نَاصِبَهُ or أَىْ نَاصِبَهُ]. (O.)<br>\

than مَطَرٌ: (K:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib, rain<br>\
that has little effect; and so in the Kur ii. 267:<br>\
(TA:) pl. طِلَالٌ (S, O, K) and طِلَلٌ, (O, K,)<br>\
the latter mentioned by Fr, and said by him to<br>\
be the only instance of the kind that has been<br>\
heard except حِرَفٌ pl. of حَرْفٌ as meaning the<br>\
حَرْف of a mountain; (O;) [or] طَلَلٌ is a contraction of طِلَالٌ: in a saying of a poet, cited by<br>\
IAar, (TA,) ↓ الطَّلَل occurs for الطَّلّ [in the CK<br>\
الطُّلّ]: or in this instance, as some relate it, the<br>\
word is الطِّلَل. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Milk: (K:)<br>\
or so ↓ طُلٌّ, with damm, in the saying مَا بِالنَّاقَةِ<br>\

-A2-  [It is also used<br>\
as an epithet.] You say يَوْمٌ طَلٌّ, meaning ذُو طَلٍّ,<br>\
i. e. [A day having drizzling rain, or dew; or]<br>\

(K;) thus accord. to AA; (O;) like طِلْعٌ.<br>\
(TA in art. طلع.)<br>\
طُلٌّ: see طَلٌّ, in two places. [But the signification of “ blood ” there mentioned requires consideration; for Sgh adds immediately after explaining the saying مَا بِالدَّارِ طُلٌّ what here<br>\
follows.] ―<br>\
-b2-  ذَهَبَ دَمُهُ طُلًّا and ↓ طِلًّا means هَدَرًا<br>\

(Mgh, Msb, TA.) [In the TA it is said to mean<br>\

as is sufficiently shown by its being there immediately added, “hence the trad. of Aboo-Bekr,<br>\
that he used to pray upon the اطلال of the ship<br>\
or boat. ”] ―<br>\
-b5-  [Hence, app.,] one says, (of a man,<br>\

O,) Joy, gladness, or happiness. (AA, O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also طَلَلٌ, in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
one says فَرَسٌ حَسَنُ الطَّلَالَةِ, meaning [A horse<br>\

in art. طلأ:] or blood that has been made to go<br>\
for nought, unretaliated, and uncompensated<br>\
