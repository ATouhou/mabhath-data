alone, He bent down his head: (MA:) or he<br>\
lowered his eyes, looking towards the ground; (S,<br>\
O, K;) and sometimes the doing so is natural:<br>\
(TA: [and the same is indicated in the S:]) and<br>\
it may mean he had a laxness in the eyelids:<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, TA:) or he contracted his eyelids, as<br>\
though his eye struck the ground: (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA:) and he was, or became, silent, (ISk, S, O,<br>\

القرى is meant, they will come to thee and<br>\
trample thee with their feet: (O:) it is like the<br>\
saying فَغُضِّ الطَّرْفَ. (S. [See also كَرَوَانٌ: and<br>\

asserted that when they desire to capture the كرا,<br>\

of them says, أَطْرِقْ كَرَا إِنَّكَ لَا تُرَى [or لَنْ تُرَى<br>\
(Meyd in explanation of the preceding prov.) i. e.<br>\
Lower thine eyes, or be silent, karà: thou wilt<br>\

called because of his [generally] needing to knock<br>\
at the door: in the Mufradát [of Er-Rághib]<br>\
said to signify a wayfarer (سَالِكٌ لِلطَّرِيقِ): but<br>\
in the common conventional language particularly<br>\
applied to the comer by night: its pl. is أَطْرَاقٌ,<br>\
like أَنْصَارٌ pl. of نَاصِرٌ, [and app., as in a sense<br>\
hereafter mentioned, طُرَّاقٌ also, agreeably with<br>\

night: (Er-Rághib, O:) or the morning-star; (S,<br>\

طُرَّاقٌ [is its p., and] signifies practisers of divination: and طَوَارِقُ [is pl. of طَارِقَةٌ, and thus] signifies female practisers of divination: Lebeed<br>\
says,<br>\

وَلَا زَاجِرَاتُ الطَّيْرِ مَا اللّٰهُ صَانِعُ<br>\

attaching طَوَارِق حَرْبِيَّة upon the gates of Cairo<br>\
and upon the entrances of the houses of the أُمَرَآء;<br>\
and De Sacy approves of the opinion of A.<br>\
Schultens and of M. Reinaud that the meaning<br>\
is Cuirasses, from the Greek<br>\
θώραξ: (see De<br>\
Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed., vol. i. pp. 274-5:)<br>\
but I think that the meaning is more probably<br>\
large maces; for such maces, each with a head<br>\
like a cannon-ball, may still be seen, if they have<br>\
not been removed within the last few years, upon<br>\
several of the gates of Cairo; and if so, طَوَارِق<br>\
in this case is app. from طَرَقَ “ he beat: ” see<br>\
also عَمُودٌ.]<br>\

in one place, the اطيرق is a species of palm-trees,<br>\
the earliest in bearing of all the palm-trees of El-<br>\
Hijáz; and by certain of the poets such are called<br>\
الطُّرَيْقُونَ and الأُطَيْرِقُونَ. (TA.)<br>\

otherwise: (see its verb, 4:)] and silent, or<br>\

also applied as an epithet to a stallion-camel:<br>\
and to a [she-camel such as is termed] جُمَالِيَّة<br>\
[i. e. one resembling a he-camel in greatness of<br>\
make], and, thus applied, [and app. likewise<br>\
when applied to a stallion-camel,] it may mean<br>\
