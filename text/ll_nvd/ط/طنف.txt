طَنِفَ, aor.<br>\
طَنَفَ, (K,) inf. n. طَنَفٌ, (TK,) the<br>\
verb of الطَّنَفُ signifying التُّهَمَةُ, (K,) [app., as<br>\
such, meaning He was suspicious, agreeably with<br>\
the rendering of Golius; or he suspected; as is<br>\
indicated by its being said of طَنِفٌ meaning مُتَّهَمٌ,<br>\
in the TA, that it is app. a possessive epithet;<br>\
for if it were a part. n., طَنِفَ would signify he was<br>\
suspected; as it is said to do in the TK and by<br>\
Freytag; in my opinion, erroneously, on the<br>\
supposition that طَنِفٌ meaning مُتَّهَمٌ is its part. n.]<br>\

-A2-  طنّف جِدَارَهُ He put above his<br>\
wall thorns or branches of trees, (O,) or thorns<br>\
