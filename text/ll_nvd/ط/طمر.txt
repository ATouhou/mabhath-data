reading is فى غَرْبِكَ i. e. in thy [state of] sharpness, and briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness: in<br>\
some copies of the K, عَزْمِكَ وَجَهْدِكَ; and in some,<br>\

in the S and K as being like a طُومَار: and this<br>\
word is particularly applied, but perhaps as a<br>\
post-classical term, to a roll of papyrus, or to<br>\
paper made of papyrus; being syn. with قِرْطَاسٌ<br>\
used in this sense: (see De Sacy&#39;s “ Rel. de<br>\
l&#39;Égypte par Abd-Allatif,” p. 109, where ElKindee is cited to this effect:) see also سِجِلٌّ:]<br>\
طُومَارٌ is said to be a foreign word introduced into<br>\
the Arabic language; but ISd thinks it to be<br>\
genuine Arabic, because Sb reckons it among the<br>\
words that are Arabic in form, and asserts it to<br>\
be quasi-coordinate to فُسْطَاطٌ: (TA:) the pl. is<br>\
طَوَامِيرُ. (S, A, K, &amp;c.) [قَلَمُ طُومَارٍ is a modern<br>\
term for A sort of large handwriting.]<br>\
أُطْمُرٌّ: see طِمِرٌّ.<br>\

إِمَامٌ and تُرٌّ; (O;) [i. e.,] like these two words,<br>\

make even, thereby, the row of stones or bricks of<br>\
the building; (T in art. ام;) the builder&#39;s cord, or<br>\

is the شَاقُول, (O,) which is a wooden implement,<br>\

upon which one of them puts the end of a rope, and<br>\
then he sticks it in the ground, and keeps it in its<br>\
place firmly by stretching the rope [app. for the<br>\
purpose of making even a row of seeds or the like].<br>\

العَظَائِمُ المُطَمَّرَاتُ, occurring in a trad., (O, TA,)<br>\
as some relate it, (TA,) means The [great] sins<br>\
that are hidden, or concealed: (O, TA:) or, as<br>\
others relate it, the latter word is ↓ المُطَمِّرَاتُ,<br>\

(K, TA.)<br>\
الأُمُورُ المُطَمِّرَاتُ (so in two copies of the S, in<br>\
the PS ↓ المُطْمِرَات, in one of my copies of the<br>\
S المطْمِرَاتُ, and in the other of those copies<br>\
