يُطَلِّمُهُنَّ بِالخُمُرِ النِّسَآءُ<br>\
(K, * TA:) or, as some relate it, يُلَطِّمُهُنَّ; but<br>\
this is weak, or repudiated: (K:) or this is the<br>\
correct reading, and the more obviously appropriate in meaning, accord. to MF; and accord.<br>\
to IAth, it is the reading commonly known, and<br>\
the same as the former in meaning: (TA:) the<br>\
meaning is, [Our coursers passing the day running<br>\
like the pouring of rain,] the women wiping the<br>\
sweat from them with the mufflers: (K, TA:) or,<br>\
as some say, [the women with the mufflers] beating<br>\

was upon them. (TA.)<br>\

bread, or lump of dough,] baked in hot ashes in a<br>\

what is baked in this is [properly called] the<br>\
طُلْمَة and خُبْزَة and مَلِيل: (S, TA:) pl. طُلَمٌ.<br>\
(L, TA.) It is said in a prov., إِنَّ دُونَ الطَّلْمَةِ<br>\
خَرْطَ قَتَادِ هُوْبَرَ (Meyd, TA) [i. e. Before the<br>\
attainment of the cake of bread baked in hot ashes<br>\
is the stripping of the leaves, by grasping each<br>\
branch and drawing the hand down it, of the<br>\
tragacanth of Howbar]: the طُلْمَة is the cake of<br>\
bread that is put in hot ashes; and Howbar is a<br>\
place abounding with the tragacanth: the prov.<br>\
is applied in relation to a thing that is unattainable. (Meyd.)<br>\

Hence, طَلَى اللَّيْلُ الآفَاقَ (tropical:)  The night covered<br>\

S, K,) pl. of رَغِيفٌ: (ISk, S:) it is thus pluralized<br>\
like a subst. because it is an epithet in which the<br>\
quality of a subst. is predominant. (AAF, TA.)<br>\

(TA;) as also ↓ طَلًا (K) [and app. ↓ طُلْوَانٌ and<br>\
↓ طَلَوَانٌ also accord. to the copies of the K followed in the TA; but see طُلْوَنٌ above]: it is<br>\
also said that ↓ طَلْوَانٌ, with fet-h, signifies saliva<br>\
