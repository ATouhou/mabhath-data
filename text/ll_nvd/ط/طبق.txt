طَبڤقَ [طَبَقَهُ, aor.<br>\
طَبِقَ, accord. to Freytag, is expl.<br>\
in the K as syn. with أَطْبَقَهُ in the first of the<br>\
senses assigned to this latter below: but I find<br>\
no authority for this in the K nor in any other<br>\
lexicon.]<br>\
-A2-  طَبِقَتْ يَدُهُ, (S, O, K, TA,) aor.<br>\
طَبَقَ;<br>\
and طَبَقَبْ, aor.<br>\
طَبُقَ; (TA;) inf. n. (of the former, S,<br>\
TA) طَبَقٌ (S, O, K, TA) and (of the latter, TA)<br>\
طَبْقٌ; (K, TA;) (assumed tropical:)  His arm would not be stretched<br>\
forth; (S, O;) or (tropical:)  stuck to his side, (K, TA,)<br>\
and would not be stretched forth. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
طَبِقَ يَفْعَلُ بِى كَذَا i. q. طَفِقَ [i. e. He set about,<br>\
or began, &amp;c., doing with me such a thing]. (O,<br>\
K. *)<br>\
2<br>\
طبّقهُ, inf. n. تَطْبِيقٌ: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
طبّق السَّحَابُ الجَوَّ The clouds covered the mid-air<br>\
between the heaven and the earth: (K:) and<br>\
الغَيْمُ السَّمَآءَ ↓ أَطْبَقَ and طَبَّقَهَا [The clouds covered<br>\
the sky]: (Mgh, TA:) both signify the same.<br>\
(TA.) And طبّق المَآءُ وَجْهَ الأَرْضِ The water<br>\
covered the face of the earth, or land. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And طبّق الشَّىْءُ, inf. n. as above, i. q. عَمَّ [The<br>\
thing was, or became, common, or general, in its<br>\
relation or relations, operation or operations,<br>\
effect or effects, &amp;c.]. (K.) And as syn. with<br>\
عَمَّ it is trans.: so in the phrase, هٰذَا مَطَرٌ طَبَّقَ<br>\
الأَرْضَ [This is rain that has included the general<br>\
extent of the land within the compass of its fall].<br>\
(TA.) And one says also, طبّق الغَيْمُ, (S, O,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. as above, (S, O, K, TA,) The clouds<br>\
rained upon the whole of the land; (S, O;) or<br>\
made their rain common, or general, (K, TA,)<br>\
to the land. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  تَطْبِيقٌ also signifies The<br>\
making a thing to suit, match, tally, conform,<br>\
correspond, or agree, with another thing. (KL.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  [And طبّق بَيْنَ الشَّيْئَيْنِ He put the two things<br>\
together, face to face. (See also 3.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Hence,]<br>\
التَّطْبِيقُ in the divinely-appointed act of prayer is<br>\
The putting the hands [together, palm to palm,]<br>\
between the thighs in the act of bowing oneself;<br>\
(S, O, K;) and in like manner in the act termed<br>\
التَّشَهُّد [q. v.]. (El-Harbee, TA.) One says of<br>\
a person bowing himself in prayer, طبّق, and<br>\
likewise ↓ اطبق, (TA,) or طبّق كَفَّيْهِ, (Mgh,)<br>\
or طبّق بَيْنَ كَفَّيْهِ ثُمَّ وَضَعَهُمَا بَيْنَ فَخِذَيْهِ, (O,)<br>\
He put his hands [together, palm to palm, ana<br>\
then put them] between his thighs. (Mgh.) The<br>\
doing thus is forbidden; (Mgh, O;) for the<br>\
hands should be placed upon the knees. (O.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
Also The horse&#39;s raising his fore feet together and<br>\
putting them down together in running: (S, O,<br>\
K:) or, accord. to As, the leaping of a camel,<br>\
or of a she-camel, and then alighting so that the<br>\
legs fall upon the ground together; the doing of<br>\
which is not approved. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And طبّقت<br>\
الإِبِلُ الطَّرِيقَ (tropical:)  The camels travelled the road without declining from the right direction. (TA.<br>\
[The verb is there written without any syll.<br>\
sings; but is evidently thus.]) ―<br>\
-b9-  And طبّق<br>\
السَّيْفُ, (S, O, TA,) [i. e. طبّق السَّيْفُ المَفْصِلَ,]<br>\
inf. n. as above, (K,) The sword hit the joint (S,<br>\
O, K, TA) and severed the limb: (S, O, TA:) or<br>\
fell between two bones. (TA.) A poet says, (S,)<br>\
namely, El-Farezdak, praising El-Hajjáj, and<br>\
likening him to a sword, (O,)<br>\
يُصَمِّمُ أَحْيَانًا وَحِينًا يُطَبِّقُ<br>\
[expl. in art. صم]. (S, O.) Hence, يُطَبِّقُ المَفْصِلَ<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  He hits aright the argument, proof,<br>\
or evidence: (S, O:) and this is also said of<br>\
an eloquent man. (AZ, TA voce قَالَبٌ, q. v.)<br>\
Hence also, طَبَّقَ alone, (assumed tropical:)  He hit upon the right<br>\
mode of judicial decision: (O, TA:) and the text<br>\
of the tradition. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
مُطَابَقَةٌ signifies The putting a thing upon,<br>\
or above, or over, another thing commensurate<br>\
therewith: whence the phrase, طَابَقْتُ النَّعْلَ [i. e.,<br>\
as expl. in Bd lxvii. 3, I sewed another sole upon<br>\
the sole or sandal]. (Er-Rághib, TA.) [Hence]<br>\
one says also, طَابَقْتُ بَيْنَ الشَّيْئَيْنِ I made the two<br>\
things commensurate, and stuck them together.<br>\
(S, O. [See also 2.]) And طابق بَيْنَ قَمِيصَيْنِ<br>\
He put on, or attired himself with, two shirts, one<br>\
over, or outside, the other; (K, TA;) and in like<br>\
manner صَافَقَ بَيْنَهُمَا, and طَارَقَ, (TA,) and ظَاهَرَ.<br>\
(A &amp;c. in art. ظهر.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And طابقهُ, (K, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. مُطَابَقَةٌ (S, O, K, TA) and طِبَاقٌ, (K, TA,)<br>\
It suited, matched, tallied, conformed, corresponded, or agreed, with it; (S, * O, * K, TA;)<br>\
and was equal to it; or was like it in measure,<br>\
size, quantity, or the like. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,]<br>\
one says, هٰذَا جَوَابٌ يُطَابِقُ السُّؤَالَ [This is an<br>\
answer, or a reply, that is suitable to the question].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And طابقت زَوْجَهَا She (a woman) complied with [the desire of] her husband: and<br>\
طابقت said of a she-camel, and of a woman,<br>\
She was, or became, submissive to him who desired<br>\
her. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And طابق لِى بِحَقِّى He obeyed<br>\
me with respect to my right, or due, and hastened<br>\
to render it; or he acknowledged to me my right,<br>\
or due, willingly. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And طابقهُ عَلَى الأَمْرِ<br>\
He combined with him, and aided him, to do the<br>\
thing: or [simply] he aided him to do it. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  And طابق عَلَى العَمَلِ He became accustomed,<br>\
habituated, or inured, to the work. (S, * O, * TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  مُطَابَقَةٌ, of a horse, (S, O, K,) in his running,<br>\
(S, O,) and in like manner of a camel, as in the<br>\
A, (TA,) means His putting his hind feet in the<br>\
places that were those of his fore feet. (S, O, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b9-  And (hence, TA) (tropical:)  The walking as one<br>\

(TA.) [See an ex. voce حِجْلٌ.]<br>\
4<br>\
اطبقهُ He covered it; (S, O, K;) as also<br>\
↓ طبّقهُ, inf. n. تَطْبِيقٌ; (K;) [i. e.] he made it to<br>\
be covered; (S, O;) he put the طَبَق, i. e. cover,<br>\
upon it, namely, a jar [or the like]. (Mgh.<br>\
[And the like is said in several other arts. in<br>\
other lexicons.]) And اطبقتُ الرَّحَى I put the<br>\
upper mill-stone upon the lower. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also 2, second sentence. [This last ex. shows<br>\
that اطبقهُ signifies sometimes It covered it as<br>\
meaning it became a cover, or like a cover, to it;<br>\
and اطبق عَلَيْهِ likewise has this meaning; as also<br>\
عليه ↓ انطبق, and عليه ↓ تطبّق.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,]<br>\
one says, اطبق عَلَيْهِ الجُنُونُ (Msb, TA) (assumed tropical:)  Insanity covered [i. e. veiled, or wholly obscured,]<br>\
his reason, or intellect. (TA.) And اطبقت عَلَيْهِ<br>\
الحُمَّى (Mgh, O, TA) (tropical:)  The fever was, or became,<br>\
continual upon him, not quitting him night nor<br>\
day. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اطبقوا عَلَى الأَمْرِ means (tropical:)  They<br>\
combined consentaneously, or agreed together,<br>\
respecting, or to do, the thing, or affair; (S, *<br>\
Mgh, * O, * Msb, TA; *) and so عَلَيْهِ ↓ تطابقوا.<br>\
(MA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And اطبقوا عَلَيْهِ They came round<br>\
about him. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [And اطبقت عَلَيْهِ الحَيَّةُ<br>\
The serpent wound itself round upon him. (See<br>\
طَبَقٌ, last sentence.)] ―<br>\
-b7-  And اطبقت النُّجُومُ The<br>\
stars appeared, and were numerous; (O, K, TA;)<br>\
[as though they were like a cover; or] as though<br>\
they were stage above stage (طَبَقَةٌ فَوْقَ طَبَقَةٍ).<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  [اطبقهُ عَلَيْهِ signifies He made it to<br>\
cover it; i. e., to be a cover, or like a cover, upon<br>\
it.] You say, أَطْبَقَ عَلَى مَخْرَجِ الحَرْفِ مِنَ اللِّسَانِ<br>\
مَا حَاذَاهُ مِنَ الحَنَكِ [He made to cover the part<br>\
of the tongue which was the place of utterance of<br>\
the letter what was opposite to it of the palate;<br>\
i. e. he put that part of his tongue close beneath<br>\

-b9-  [Hence,]<br>\
أَطْبَقَ عَلَيْهِمُ العَذَابَ, said of God, (tropical:)  He made<br>\
punishment to fall, or come, upon them in common,<br>\
or universally, [as though He made it to cover<br>\

الجُنُونَ, (assumed tropical:)  God made the fever to be continual<br>\
upon him, and in like manner insanity: the verb<br>\
being used as intrans. and trans. (Msb. [But<br>\
its author adds that he had not found this:<br>\
meaning that he had not found any classical<br>\
authority for the trans. use of the verb in this<br>\
and similar senses.]) ―<br>\
-b11-  One says also, اطبق البَابَ<br>\
[He closed the door]. (Msb and K in art. وصد;<br>\
&amp;c.) And أَطْبِقْ شَفَتَيْكَ [Close thy lips;] i. e. (assumed tropical:)  be<br>\
thou silent. (TA.) [And اطبق الكِتَابَ He closed,<br>\
or shut, the book. And اطبق الثَّوْبَ He folded<br>\

How skilful is he (O, K) لِكَذَا [for the performance of such a thing]! (O) is form طَبَّقَ المَفْصِلَ.<br>\

-b2-  تطبّق عَلَيْهِ: see 4. [Hence,]<br>\
one says, لَوْ تَطَبَّقَتِ السَّمَآءُ عَلَى الأَرْضِ مَا فَعَلْتُ<br>\
كَذَا [If the heaven became as a cover upon the<br>\
earth, I would not do such a thing]. (S, O.)<br>\
6<br>\
تطابق الشَّيْآنِ The two things suited,<br>\
matched, tallied, conformed, corresponded, or<br>\
agreed, each with the other; (S, * O, * TA;) and<br>\
were equal, each to the other; or were like each<br>\
other in measure, size, quantity, or the like.<br>\
(TA.) And تطابقوا عَلَى الأَمْرِ: see 4.<br>\
7<br>\
انطبق It was, or became, covered; (O, K;)<br>\
[i. e.] it was made to be covered;] or it had the<br>\
طَبَق, i. e. cover, put upon it;] quasi-pass. of<br>\
أَطْبَقَهُ; (O;) and so ↓ تطبّق. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[And It became closed; said of a door, &amp;c. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Hence,] يَنْطَبِقُ عَلَيْهِ الكَلَامُ i. q. يَنْغَلِقُ (assumed tropical:)  [Speech<br>\
is as though it were closed against him; i. e. he<br>\
is impeded in his speech, unable to speak, or<br>\
tonguetied]. (O.) ―<br>\

-b5-  [Hence one<br>\
says of a rule, يَنْطَبِقُ عَلَى كَذَا وَكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  It<br>\
applies to such and such things or subjects.]<br>\
طَبْقٌ: see an ex. of the accus. case, in the<br>\
phrase وَلَدَتِ الغَنَمُ طَبْقًا, voce طَبَقٌ, last quarter.<br>\
-A2-  طَبْقٌ is also expl., by IAar, as meaning The<br>\

allegation. (TA.)<br>\
طِبْقٌ: see طَبَقٌ, in the latter part of the former<br>\

-b2-  طِبْقُ الأَرْضِ: see طِبَاقٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ<br>\
طِبْقُ هٰذَا, (IAar, O, K, *) and ↓ طَبَقُهُ, and<br>\
↓ طِبَاقُهُ, (IAar, * O, * K,) and ↓ طَبِيقُهُ, (IAar,<br>\
O, K,) and ↓ طَابَقُهُ, and ↓ مُطْبَقُهُ, (IAar, O,<br>\

-b4-  طِبْقٌ signifies<br>\
also A space, or period, (سَاعَةٌ,) of the day; and<br>\
so ↓ طِبْقَةٌ: and ↓ طَبِيقٌ signifies the same of the<br>\

and ↓ طِبْقَةً, I remained at his abode during a<br>\
space, or period, (سَاعَةً,) of the day: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád,<br>\

↓ طَبَقًا, (so in the O,) and ↓ طَبِيقًا, i. e. a while,<br>\
or a long time, syn. مَلِيًّا: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K:)<br>\
or, accord. to the L, one says, أَتَانَا بَعْدَ طِبْقٍ مِنَ<br>\
اللَّيْلِ, and ↓ طَبِيق, he came to us after a space,<br>\
or period, (حِينٍ,) of the night; and in like<br>\
manner, مِنَ النَّهَارِ of the day: (TA:) the pl. of<br>\
طَبِيقٌ is طُبْقٌ. (K.) [See also طَبَقٌ, in, or near,<br>\
the middle of the paragraph.]<br>\

-A4-  and i. q. دَسْتُور [as a Pers. word, generally<br>\
meaning Permission, or leave, as expl. by Golius<br>\

significations I have not found any other authority.])<br>\
طَبَقٌ A thing that is the equal of another thing<br>\
(Msb, K) of any kind (K) in its measure so that<br>\
it covers the whole extent of the latter like the<br>\
lid: this is its primary signification: (Msb:)<br>\
[whence] one says, هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ طَبَقُ هٰذَا, like طِبْقُهُ,<br>\
q. v.: (IAar, O, K:) and [hence] it signifies The<br>\
cover, or lid, (Mgh, K,) of a jar, (Mgh,) or of<br>\
anything: (K:) pl. أَطْبَاقٌ (S, * O, * K) [and<br>\

another, but similar, sense, which will be found<br>\
in what follows, but better known as a pl. of<br>\
طَبَقَةٌ], and أَطْبِقَةٌ is added as another pl. in the K,<br>\
but [SM says] this is strange; I have not found<br>\
it in the [other] lexicons; and it may be that the<br>\
right reading is وَأَطْبَقَهُ, as syn. with what immediately there follows it, i. e. وَطَبَّقَهُ. (TA.)<br>\
وَافَقَ شَنٌّ طَبَقَهْ is [a prov.] expl. (O, K, TA) by<br>\

made a طَبَق [or cover] for it: (O, K, TA:) [so<br>\
that the meaning is, A water-skin that had become old and worn out suited its cover:] or شَنٌّ<br>\
and طَبَقٌ [in the O طبقه] were two tribes; (S, *<br>\
O, K * TA;) and, as ISd says, شَنٌّ does not<br>\
here mean a water-skin, for this has no طَبَق:<br>\
(TA:) or [طَبَقَهٌ is for طَبَقَةَ, and] طَبَقَةُ was an<br>\
intelligent woman, whom an intelligent man took<br>\
as his wife. (O, K, TA. [See Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov., ii. 800.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A certain household<br>\
utensil; (Msb;) [i. e. a dish, or plate; perhaps<br>\
thus called because the cover of a cooking-vessel<br>\

and the thing upon which fruit is placed [i. e. a<br>\

طِبَاقٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\

أَخْفَيْتُهُ تَحْتَ أَطْبَاقِ التُّرَابِ I concealed it beneath<br>\

that forms a division between any two vertebræ:<br>\
(S, O, K:) what is between any two vertebræ of a<br>\
horse [&amp;c.]: pl. أَطْبَاقٌ: (Kr:) and some say, the<br>\
vertebræ altogether: and some say, a vertebra, in<br>\
any part. (TA.) It is said in a trad. respecting<br>\
the day of resurrection, تَبْقَى أَصْلَابُ المُنَافِقِينَ<br>\
طَبَقًا وَاحِدًا, meaning [The backbones of the hypocrites shall be (lit. continue to be) as though<br>\
they were] one vertebra: or, as some say,<br>\
↓ طَبَقَةً; and [they say that] طَبَقٌ is the pl. [or<br>\
coll. gen. n.]. (O. [See also 1 in art. عقم.]) ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
[And Any of the successively-superimposed cartilages of the windpipe: pl. أَطْبَاقٌ. (See حَنْجَرَةٌ, in<br>\
art. حجر; and see also حُلْقُومٌ.)] ―<br>\

lowest is imagined to be like a cover over<br>\
another]. (TA.) [And in like manner, Any of<br>\

meaning The Heavens are [composed of stages]<br>\
one above another; (S, O, Msb; *) every heaven<br>\
[except the lowest] being like a طبق to another:<br>\
(Msb:) or this is said because of their being conformable, one with another: (K:) and it is said<br>\
in the Kur lxvii. 3, اَلَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمٰوَاتٍ طِبَاقًا,<br>\
meaning [Who hath created seven heavens] placed<br>\

they pass away and another طَبق comes: (O,<br>\
TA:) or, as IAar says, طَبَقٌ signifies a people<br>\
after a people. (TA.) And (TA) A قَرْن [i. e.<br>\
generation] of time: or twenty years: (K, TA:)<br>\
or, as in the book of El-Hejeree, on the authority<br>\
of I&#39;Ab, ↓ طَبَقَةٌ has this latter meaning. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b15-  (tropical:)  A rain such as fills and covers the earth, or<br>\
land; (TA;) or such as is general, (S, O, K, TA,)<br>\
and of wide extent; termed by a poet (namely,<br>\
Imra-el-Keys, O, TA) طَبَقُ الأَرْضِ: (S, O, TA:)<br>\
or a lasting rain, consecutive in its falls. (Msb.)<br>\
And أَصْبَحَتِ الأَرْضُ طَبَقًا وَاحِدًا means (assumed tropical:)  [The<br>\
land became, or became in the morning,] covered<br>\
with water over its surface. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b16-  A main<br>\
portion of the night and of the day: (S, O, K:)<br>\
or, accord. to the Mufradát [of Er-Rághib], طَبَقُ<br>\
اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ signifies سَاعَاتُهُ المطابقة [app. a mistranscription for المُتَطَابِقَةُ, and meaning the commensurate, or similar, or equal, portions of the<br>\
night and of the day]. (TA.) See also طِبْقٌ. ―<br>\
-b17-<br>\
And A state, or condition; (S, O, K, TA;) as<br>\
also ↓ طَبَقَةٌ, of which the pl. is طِبَاقٌ: the pl. of<br>\
the former in this sense is أَطْبَاقٌ. (TA.) Hence<br>\
the phrase, لَتَرْكَبُنَّ طَبَقًا عَنْ طَبَقٍ, (S, O, K, TA,)<br>\
in the Kur [lxxxiv. 19], meaning [Ye shall<br>\
assuredly enter upon] state after state, (S, * O,<br>\
TA,) and predicament after predicament; as in<br>\
the A; (TA;) on the day of resurrection; (S;)<br>\
the state being termed طَبَق because it will fill the<br>\
hearts [as though the dread thereof covered them],<br>\
or will be near to doing so; (O, TA;) and عَنْ<br>\
being put in this instance, as it is in many others,<br>\
in the place of بَعْدَ: (TA:) or the meaning is,<br>\
one after another of similar states of hardship:<br>\
or it may be, degrees of hardship after degrees<br>\
thereof; طَبَقٌ accord. to this rendering being<br>\
regarded as pl. [or coll. gen. n.] of ↓ طَبَقَةٌ:<br>\
(Ksh and Bd:) or [ye shall assuredly mount<br>\
upon] the heaven in one state after another state;<br>\
for it (the heaven) shall be like مُهْل [i. e. molten<br>\
brass or iron &amp;c., as is said in the Kur lxx. 8,] and<br>\
then successively in other states: (O, TA:) so<br>\
says Aboo-Bekr: accord. to Er-Rághib, it points<br>\
to the various successive states of man in the<br>\
present world from his creation, and in the world<br>\
to come until his resting in one of the two abodes<br>\
[Paradise or Hell]: or, accord. to Ibn-Abi-l-<br>\
Hadeed, it means [ye shall assuredly enter upon]<br>\
difficulty after difficulty; as is related by MF;<br>\
and the same is said by Az on the authority of<br>\
I&#39;Ab: (TA:) some read لَتَرْكَبَنَّ, meaning thou,<br>\
O Mohammad, shalt assuredly mount upon stage<br>\
after stage of the stages (أَطْبَاق) of heaven; and<br>\
I&#39;Ab and Ibn-Mes-ood read لَتَرْكَبِنَّ, with kesr<br>\
to the ب, which is accord. to the dial. of Temeem,<br>\
and Keys and Asad and Rabee&#39;ah pronounce the<br>\
first letter of the future with kesr except when it<br>\
is ى: &#39;Omar read لَيَرْكَبَنَّ, either as relating to<br>\
the Prophet or as referring to him who is mentioned in verses 10-15 of the same chapter. (O,<br>\
TA.) One says also, بَاتَ يَرْعَى طَبَقَ النُّجُومِ,<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  [He passed the night watching] the<br>\
state of the stars in their course: (TA:) or طَبَقُ<br>\
النُّجُومِ means the falling [or app. setting] of stars<br>\
after [other] stars: or, accord. to Es-Sadoosee,<br>\
the rising of a star and the setting of another:<br>\
and a collective number thereof after a collective<br>\
number [of others]: and such, he says, are termed<br>\
مِنَ النُّجُومِ ↓ طَبَقَاتٌ. (O.) ―<br>\
-b18-  جَآءَتِ الإِبِلُ طَبَقًا<br>\
وَاحِدًا means عَلَى خُفٍّ وَاحِدٍ [i. e. The camels<br>\
came following one another, in a single line: see<br>\
art. خف]. (TA.) And one says, وَلَدَتِ الغَنَمُ<br>\
طَبَقًا and ↓ طَبْقًا, meaning The sheep, or goats,<br>\
brought forth one after another: (L:) El-Umawee<br>\
says, when they do thus, one says, وَلَدَتْهَا الرُّجَيْلَآءِ<br>\
and وَلَدَتْهَا طَبَقًا and ↓ طَبَقَةً [They brought them<br>\
forth (i. e. their young ones) one after another].<br>\
(S, O.) ―<br>\
-b19-  [The pl.] الأَطْبَاقُ also signifies Those<br>\
who are remote, and those who are remotely connected: so in a trad. respecting the signs of the<br>\
resurrection, or of the time thereof; in which it<br>\
is said, يُوْصَلُ الأَطْبَاقُ وَيُقْطَعُ الأَرْحَامُ [Those who<br>\
are remote, and those who are remotely related,<br>\
shall be brought into close connection, and the ties<br>\
of relationship shall be severed]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b20-  بِنْتُ<br>\
طَبَقٍ is an appellation of A female tortoise, [app.<br>\
because of the cover of her back,] which, (S, O,<br>\
K,) as the Arabs assert, (S, O,) lays ninety-nine<br>\
eggs, all of them [eventually] tortoises, and lays<br>\
one egg which discloses (S, O, K) a serpent (K)<br>\
[or a serpent such as is termed] an أَسْوَد; (S, O;)<br>\
or, accord. to Az, sixty-nine [eggs], and the seventieth is [eventually] a viper. (So in a marg. note<br>\
in one of my copies of the S; in which, also, the<br>\
appellation is written بِنْتُ طَبَقَ, instead of بِنْتُ<br>\
طَبَقٍ.) Hence the phrase إِحْدَى بَنَاتِ طَبَقٍ,<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  A calamity; (S, O, TA;) as also<br>\
بِنْتُ طَبَقٍ: (TA:) بَنَاتُ طَبَقٍ meaning calamities<br>\
[like مُطْبِقَاتٌ]: as well as tortoises: and serpents: (K:) and أُمُّ طَبَقٍ [in like manner] means<br>\
calamity: (TA in art. طرق:) or, accord. to EthTha&#39;álibee, طَبَقُ [thus, imperfectly decl., as<br>\
written in the L,) signifies a yellow serpent:<br>\
(L, TA:) and أُمُّ طَبَقٍ and بِنْتُ طَبَقٍ are said to<br>\
signify the serpent, because of its coiling itself<br>\
round: or بَنَاتُ طَبَقٍ is an appellation applied<br>\
to serpents because of their winding themselves<br>\
round (لإِطْبَاقِهَا) upon him whom they bite; or,<br>\
as some say, because the حَوَّآء [q. v.] confines<br>\
them beneath the lids (أَطْبَاق) of the baskets<br>\
(أَسْفَاط) covered with leather; or, as Z says,<br>\
because they resemble the طَبَق [i. e. cover, or<br>\
dish, or plate,] when they coil themselves round.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

of طَبَقٌ]. ―<br>\
-b2-  طِبَاقُ الأَرْضِ means What is upon<br>\
the earth: (S, O:) or what fills, or would fill,<br>\
the earth, extending over it in general, or in common, (O, TA,) as though it were a طَبَق [or cover]<br>\
to it. (TA.) It is said in a trad. respecting<br>\
Kureysh, عِلْمُ عَالِمِهِمْ طِبَاقُ الأَرْضِ i. e. The knowledge of the knowing of them is as though it<br>\
extended over the earth in general, or in common,<br>\
and were a cover to it; (O, * TA;) or, as some<br>\
relate it, الأَرْضِ ↓ طِبْقُ. (TA.) ―<br>\

يُطَبِّق المرأةَ,) with his breast by reason of his<br>\
heaviness: (K, TA:) or impotent; syn. عِيِىٌّ:<br>\
(S, O:) or impotent (عَيِىٌّ), heavy, covering her<br>\

age: accord. to As, stupid, foolish, impotent in<br>\
speech or actions, dull, or heavy: accord. to<br>\
IAar, whose reason is veiled, or wholly obscured,<br>\
(عَلَيْهِ ↓ مُطْبَقٌ, [see أَطْبَقَ عَلَيْهِ الجُنُونُ,]) by stupidity, or foolishness: or, as some say, whose<br>\
affairs are veiled to him [so that he sees not how<br>\
to accomplish them]: or who lacks ability to<br>\

slip [between the fingers] when squeezed, applied<br>\

upon it, they consolidate; it has a clustered<br>\
yellow flower; is not eaten by the camels, but<br>\
by the sheep or goats; and grows among the<br>\
rocks, with the عَرْعَر; the bees eat from its<br>\
flowers, and the mountain-goats also feed upon<br>\
it: (O:) it is beneficial as an antidote against<br>\
poisons, taken internally and applied as a dressing, and as a remedy for the mange, or scab, and<br>\
the itch, and fevers of long continuance, and colic,<br>\
and jaundice, and obstructions of the liver; and<br>\
is very healing. (K.) [طُبَاقٌ, thus written by<br>\

―<br>\
-b6-  It signifies also A subterranean prison; or<br>\
a place of confinement beneath the ground. (TA.<br>\
[The word in this sense, which is probably postclassical, is there said to be like مُحْسِنٌ; but<br>\
