طَحَنَ البُرَّ, aor.<br>\
طَحَنَ, inf. n. طَحْنٌ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) said of a man, (S,) He ground the wheat;<br>\
i. e. he made the wheat into دَقِيق [i. e. flour];<br>\
and so [but app. in an intensive sense] ↓ طحّنهُ.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence] one says, طَحَنَهُمْ فَأَهْلَكَهُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [He<br>\
crushed them and destroyed them]. (T and M and<br>\
K in art. دم.) And حَرْبٌ تَطْحَنُ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ (assumed tropical:)  [A<br>\
war that crushes every thing]. (TA. [See also<br>\
طَحُونٌ.]) And طَحَنَتْهُمُ المَنُونُ (assumed tropical:)  [Time, or<br>\
death, reduced them to dust]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And one<br>\
says also, طَحَنَتِ الرَّحَى [The mill-stone ground;<br>\
or revolved]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And [hence,] طَحَنَتِ الأَفْعَى<br>\
The viper turned round about; or coiled itself.<br>\
(S, K. *)<br>\
2<br>\
طَحَّنَ see the preceding paragraph, first sentence.<br>\
طَحْنٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
طِحْنٌ Flour; (S, MA, K;) as also ↓ طَحِينٌ:<br>\
(MA:) or ground wheat and the like; [or meal;]<br>\
and sometimes the inf. n., ↓ طَحْنٌ, is used in<br>\
this sense. (Msb.) Hence the prov., أَسْمَعُ<br>\
جَعْجَعَةً وَلَا أَرَى طِحْنًا [I hear a sound of the mill,<br>\
or mill-stone, but I see not flour]. (K.)<br>\
طُحَنٌ A certain small creeping thing, (دُوَيْبَّةٌ,<br>\
S, K, TA,) in form like [the species of lizard, or<br>\
reptile, called] أُمّ حُبَيْن, [see art. حبن,] but more<br>\
slender (أَلْطَفُ) than this latter, that raises its tail<br>\
like as does the pregnant camel, and, when bidden<br>\
to grind, by the children of the Arabs of the<br>\
desert, grinds with itself the ground until it becomes concealed in the soft soil; and one never<br>\
sees it but in a tract of ground such as is termed<br>\
بَلُّوقَة: Az says that ↓ طُحَنَةٌ signifies a certain<br>\
small creeping thing (دويبّة) like the [beetle called]<br>\
جُعَل; and that طُحَنٌ is the pl.: [but, properly<br>\
speaking, the latter is a coll. gen. n., and the<br>\
former is the n. un.:] As says that it is [a<br>\
creature] smaller than the hedge-hog, that comes<br>\
into existence in the sands, appearing sometimes,<br>\
and turning round as though grinding, and then<br>\
diving [into the sand]: (TA: [see also عَوَانَةٌ:])<br>\
and, (K,) accord. to Aboo-Kheyreh, (TA,) the<br>\
طُحَن is what is called لَيْثُ عِفِرِّينَ [q. v. in art.<br>\
عفر], (K, TA, in the CK لَيْثُ عِفْرِينَ,) resembling<br>\
the pistachio-nut, in colour like the dust, that<br>\
buries itself in the earth. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app.,]<br>\
Short: (K:) [or] accord. to Zj, ↓ طُحَنَةٌ signifies<br>\
short, having in him لُوثَة [app. meaning stupidity,<br>\
or the like]; and IB says that he who is tall,<br>\
having in him لوثة, is termed عُسْقُدٌ: (TA:)<br>\
accord. to IAar, short in the utmost degree: (Az,<br>\
TA:) accord. to IKh, the shortest of the short;<br>\
and the tallest of the tall is termed سَمَرْ طُولٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
طُحَنَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
طَحُونٌ (assumed tropical:)  A war (حَرْبٌ) that crushes (تَطْحَنُ)<br>\
everything. (TA.) And [hence] الطَّحُونُ is a<br>\
name for (assumed tropical:)  War. (Az, K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence<br>\
also] (tropical:)  A كَتِيبَة [or troop] that crushes (تَطْحَنُ)<br>\
what it meets: (S, TA:) or a great كَتِيبَة: (K:)<br>\
or a كتيبة of horsemen, mighty, or valorous, and<br>\
numerous. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  Numerous camels;<br>\
as also ↓ طَحَّانَةٌ: (S, K:) or both signify camels<br>\
when they are [many, and are] such as are termed<br>\
رِفَاق, and have their owners with them; (TA;)<br>\
as also رَطُونٌ and رَطَّانَةٌ: (As, TA in art. رطن,<br>\
q. v.:) and the former, about three hundred<br>\
sheep or goats; (K;) accord. to Lh; but ISd<br>\
says, I know not any other who has mentioned<br>\
the طحون of sheep or goats. (TA.)<br>\
طَحِينٌ and ↓ مَطْحُونٌ (Msb, TA) and ↓ مُطَحَّنٌ<br>\
(TA) Ground wheat (Msb, TA) and the like<br>\
thereof. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  For the first, see also طِحْنٌ.<br>\
طِحَانَةٌ The craft, or occupation, of the طَحَّان<br>\
[or miller]. (K.)<br>\
طَحِينَةٌ The dregs of the oil of sesame. (TA.)<br>\
طَحَّانٌ [meaning A miller, or grinder of wheat<br>\
and the like,] is thus, perfectly decl., if you do<br>\
not derive it from الطَّحُّ: (K, TA:) i. e. طَحَّان,<br>\
if you derive it from الطَّحْنُ, is perfectly decl.;<br>\
but if you derive it from الطَّحُّ, or from الطَّحَا<br>\
which signifies “ the expanded tract of land,” it<br>\
is imperfectly decl.: (S, TA:) if from الطَّحُّ, it<br>\
is of the measure فَعْلَانُ, not فَعَّالٌ; and if from<br>\
الطَّحَا, it would be by rule طَحْوَانُ. (IB, TA.)<br>\
طَحَّانَةٌ: see طَاحُونَةٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also طَحُونٌ.<br>\
طَاحِنٌ The bull, of those that tread the wheat,<br>\
that stands [الَّذِى يَقُومُ, for which الَّّتِى تَقُومُ is<br>\
erroneously put in the K and TA,] in the middle<br>\
of the heap thereof and around which the other<br>\
bulls turn: (K, TA:) mentioned by En-Nadr,<br>\
on the authority of El-Jaadee. (TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
طَيْحَنٌ, mentioned by Freytag as meaning A<br>\
frying-pan (“ sartago ”), is evidently a mistranscription, for طَيْجَنٌ.]<br>\
طَاحِنَةٌ, (Msb, TA,) in which the ة is added<br>\
to give intensiveness to the signification, (Msb,)<br>\
[or to convert the epithet طَاحِنٌ into a subst.,]<br>\
sing. of طَوَاحِنُ, (Msb, TA,) which signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The أَضْرَاس [as meaning the molar teeth, or<br>\
grinders,] (S, Msb, K, TA) of a man and of<br>\
others; as being likened to a mill. (TA.)<br>\
طَاحُونٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
طَاحُونَةٌ A mill: (S, Msb, K:) [also called in<br>\
the present day ↓ طَاحُونٌ: and the same meaning<br>\
is assigned by Golius and Freytag, by the latter<br>\
as on the authority of the K, (in which I do not<br>\
find it,) to ↓ مِطْحَنَةٌ, pl. مَطَاحِنُ; and by Golius<br>\
to ↓ مِطْحَانٌ likewise:] or a mill that is turned by<br>\
water; (Lth, MA, Mgh;) as also ↓ طَحَّانَةٌ:<br>\
(Lth, Mgh, TA:) or this signifies a mill that is<br>\
turned by a beast [as طاحونة and طاحون do in<br>\
the present day]: (MA, Mgh:) pl. of the first<br>\
طَوَاحِينُ. (Msb, TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
مَطْحَنَةٌ is said by Golius, as on the authority<br>\
of the KL, (in which however I do not find it,)<br>\
to signify A place where grinding is performed.]<br>\
مِطْحَنَةٌ: see طَاحُونَةٌ.<br>\
مُطَحَّنٌ: see طَحِينٌ.<br>\
مِطْحَانٌ A viper turning round about; or<br>\
coiling itself. (S, K.) A poet says,<br>\
بِخَرْسَآءَ مِطْحَانٍ كَأَنَّ فَحِيحَهَا<br>\
إِذَا فَزِعَتْ مَآءٌ هُرِيقَ عَلَى جَمْرِ<br>\
[With a coiling viper, as though its hissing, when<br>\
it is frightened, were the sound of water poured<br>\
upon live coals]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\

مَطْحُونٌ: see طَحِينٌ. ―<br>\

طَحَا, aor. يَطْحُو, inf. n. طَحْوٌ; and طَحَى,<br>\
aor. يَطْحَى, inf. n. طَحْىٌ; two dial. vars., though<br>\
only طَحَى, like سَعَى, is mentioned in the K;<br>\
(TA;) He spread [a thing]; spread [it] out, or<br>\
forth; expanded [it] ; or extended [it]. (K, TA.)<br>\
You say, طَحَوْتُهُ, like دَحَوْتُهُ, i. e. I spread it;<br>\
&amp;c. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And you say, القَوْمُ يَطْحَى بَعْضُهُمْ<br>\

(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  طَحَى, (K,) or طَحَا, (TA,) also signifies It, or he, became spread, spread out or forth,<br>\
expanded, or extended; (K, TA;) being intrans.<br>\
as well as trans. (TA.) Accord. to As, (TA,)<br>\
طَحَا مِنَ الضَّرْبَةِ means He became extended (S,<br>\
TA) upon the ground (TA) in consequence of the<br>\
blow: (S, TA:) [and this is probably meant by<br>\
what here follows:] طَحَا is said when one throws<br>\
down a man upon his face; (K, TA;) or when<br>\
he spreads, or extends, him; or when he prostrates him on the ground: (TA:) but accord. to<br>\
Fr, one says, ↓ شَرِبَ حَتَّى طَحَّى i. e. [He drank<br>\
until] he stretched out his legs: and البَعِيرُ ↓ طحّى<br>\
إِلَى الأَرْضِ i. e. The camel stuck to the ground,<br>\
either from emptiness or from emaciation: and<br>\
in like manner one says of a man when people<br>\
call him to aid or to do an act of kindness: the<br>\
verb being in all these instances with teshdeed:<br>\
as though, by saying this, he contradicted As as<br>\
to its being without teshdeed. (TA.) Accord.<br>\
to AA, (S,) طَحَيْتُ means I lay, or lay upon my<br>\
side, or laid my side upon the ground. (S, K. *)<br>\
And you say, ↓ نَامَ فُلَانٌ فَتَطَحَّى i. e. [Such a<br>\
one slept, and] lay, or lay upon his side, in a<br>\
wide space of ground. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, i. e. طَحَا,<br>\
(AA, S,) or طَحَى, (K,) He (a man, AA, S)<br>\
went away into the country, or in the land: (AA,<br>\
S, K:) like طَهَا. (S in art. طهو.) One says, مَا<br>\
أَدْرِى أَيْنَ طَحَا [I know not whither he has gone<br>\
away &amp;c.]. (S.) And طَحَا بِهِ قَلْبُهُ His heart<br>\
carried him away (ذَهَبَ بِهِ) in [the pursuit of]<br>\
anything: (S, K:) whence the saying of Alkameh<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Abadeh,<br>\
طَحَا بِكَ قَلْبٌ فِى الحِسَانِ طَرُوبُ<br>\
بُعَيْدَ الشَّبَابِ عَصْرَ حَانَ مَشِيبُ<br>\
[A heart much affected with emotion has carried<br>\
thee away in the pursuit of the beauties long after<br>\
youthfulness, in the time when entering upon<br>\
hoariness has arrived: بُعَيْدَ being here a dim.<br>\
used for the purpose of enhancement]. (S, TA.)<br>\
And طَحَى بِكَ هَمَّكَ Thy anxiety has carried thee<br>\
away in a far-extending course. (TA.) And<br>\
طَحَى بِالكُرَةِ He threw the ball. (TA.) And<br>\
طَحَى بِفُلَانٍ شَحْمُهُ Such a one became fat. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  طَحَا, aor. يَطْحُو, signifies also He, or it, was<br>\

طحى, is there expl. as meaning The lower, or<br>\
baser, or the lowest, or basest, of mankind, or of<br>\
the people.]<br>\
طَحْيَةٌ A portion of clouds; as also طَخْيَةٌ.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
أَقْبَلَ التَّيْسُ فِى طَحْيَائِهِ is expl. by AZ as meaning [The he-goat came] in his state of rattling at<br>\
rutting-time (فِى هَبِيبِهِ). (TA. [But probably the<br>\
right expression is فى طَخْيَائِهِ: see طَخْيَآءُ.])<br>\
طَحَّانُ as derived from الطَّحَا: see طَحَّانٌ, in<br>\
art. طحن.<br>\
طَاحٍ Spread; spread out, or forth; expanded;<br>\
or extended. (S, * K. [See also مُطَحٍّ.]) And That<br>\
has filled everything by its multitude: (K, TA:)<br>\

in the S] applied to an army. (TA.) And one<br>\
says مِظَلَّةٌ طَاحِيَةٌ and ↓ مَطْحُوَّةٌ and ↓ مَطْحِيَّةٌ,<br>\
meaning A great (T, K, TA) spreading (TA)<br>\
tent. (T, K, * TA.) And المُدَوِّمَةُ الطَّوَاحِى<br>\

-b2-  Also High,<br>\
elevated, or lofty: so in the phrase لَا وَالقَمَرِ<br>\
الطَّاحِى [No, by the high moon]; an oath of some<br>\
of the Arabs. (TA.) [And Tall as applied to a<br>\
horse: so طاحى is expl. in the TA; but this,<br>\
being without the article ال, is a mistake for<br>\
طَاحٍ.] ―<br>\
