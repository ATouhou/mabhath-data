طَبَيْتُهُ عَنْهُ, (S, K,) aor. أَطْبِيهِ, inf. n. طَبْىٌ,<br>\
(TA,) I turned him away, or back, from it,<br>\
(Lth, S, K, TA,) namely, his opinion, and his<br>\
affair, &amp;c. (Lth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And طَبَيْتُهُ إِلَيْهِ I called<br>\
him to it; as also ↓ اِطَّبَيْتُهُ [in the CK erroneously written اَطْبَيْتُهُ]. (K, TA. See also art.<br>\
طبو.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And طَبَيْتُهُ I led him. (K, TA.) And<br>\
thus Lh explains the ex. of this verb in the verse<br>\
of Dhu-r-Rummeh cited voce ضَارِبٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
طَبِيَتْ, aor.<br>\
طَبَىَ, inf. n. طَبًى; (TA;) or طَبِيَتْ طَبًى<br>\
شَدِيدًا; (K; [in the CK, erroneously, طَبْيًا;])<br>\
said of a she-camel, Her طُبْى [q. v.] was, or<br>\
became, flaccid, flabby, or pendulous; (TA;) or<br>\
very flaccid &amp;c.; (K;) on the authority of Fr.<br>\

the same verb in art. طبو.<br>\
طُبْىٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ طِبْىٌ (S,<br>\
K) [A teat, or dug, of any of certain animals<br>\
mentioned in what follows; agreeably with an explanation of its pl. in the O, voce ضَرْعٌ, on the<br>\
authority of AZ; and agreeably with a usage of<br>\
its pl. in the TA, voce خِلْفٌ, on the authority of<br>\
Lth: this is the most usual, if not the only<br>\
proper, signification:] the ضَرْع [which sometimes<br>\
means the teat, or dug, and is app. here used in<br>\
this sense]; mostly, of a beast of prey: (Mgh:)<br>\
or it is to the beast of prey, and to the solid-hoofed<br>\
animal, (As, T, S,) like the ضَرْع to others; and<br>\
sometimes to the camel; (S;) or that of the<br>\
camel and of the cloven-hoofed animal is termed<br>\
خِلْفٌ: (As, T:) or, to the camel, and to the<br>\
cloven-hoofed animal, like the ثَدْى [which some-<br>\
times means the teat] to the woman; and in rare<br>\
instances, to the solid-hoofed animal, and to the<br>\
beast of prey: (Msb:) or the حَلَمَات [meaning<br>\
teats], (K, TA,) or, accord. to the M, the<br>\
حَلَمَتَانِ [meaning pair of teats], (TA,) of the ضَرْع<br>\
[or udder], of the camel, and of a cloven-hoofed<br>\
animal, and of a solid-hoofed animal, and of a<br>\
beast of prey: (K:) [and ↓ طُبْيَةٌ is perhaps a<br>\
dial. var.: (see خَاتَمٌ, last sentence but two:)]<br>\
pl. أَطْبَآءٌ. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.) It is said in a<br>\
prov., (S,) [and] in a letter of &#39;Othmán to &#39;Alee,<br>\
(TA,) جَاوَزَ الحِزَامُ الطُّبْيَيْنِ (S, K) The girth<br>\
passed beyond the طُبْيَان [or two teats, or two pairs<br>\
of teats]; (TA;) meaning (assumed tropical:)  the affair, or case,<br>\
became distressing, and formidable. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
El-Hoseyn Ibn-Muteyr uses the pl. metaphorically in relation to rain, by way of comparison,<br>\
saying,<br>\
كَثُرَتْ كَكَثْرَةِ وَبْلِهِ أَطْبَاؤُهُ<br>\
فَإِذَا تَجَلَّتْ فَاضَتِ الأَطْبَآءُ<br>\
[in which, for تَجَلَّتْ, I read تَحَلَّبَ; for the<br>\
verse, literally rendered, seems to mean, (tropical:)  Its<br>\
teats were abundant as the abundance of its heavy<br>\
rain, (or rather I would read لِكَثْرَةِ وبله by reason<br>\
of the abundance &amp;c.,) so that when it flowed<br>\
with rain, as though it were milked, the teats<br>\
poured forth exuberantly]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَطْبَآءُ الكَلْبَةِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Bitch&#39;s dugs] is an appellation of the tree called<br>\
مُخَاطَة [i. e. the sebesten]. (TA in art. مخط, q. v.)<br>\
طِبْىٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
طُبْيَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
طَبِيَةٌ, like فَرِحَةٌ, on the authority of Fr, in the<br>\
K erroneously written طَبِيَّةٌ, (TA,) [and also<br>\
there misplaced, for, with فَهِىَ (in the CK فَهُوَ)<br>\
preceding it, it should follow immediately after<br>\
the explanation of the phrase طَبِيَتِ النَّاقَةُ, being<br>\
the part. n., and thus signifying Whose طُبْى is<br>\
flaccid, flabby, or pendulous,] applied to a she-camel; (Fr, TA;) and طَبْوَآءُ signifies the same;<br>\
(Fr, K, TA;) or this is applied to a she-goat,<br>\
meaning whose dugs (خِلْفَاهَا) descend towards the<br>\
ground. (So in one of my copies of the S: in the<br>\
other copy omitted.)<br>\
خِلْفٌ طَبِىٌّ i. q. مُجِيبٌ [meaning Yielding<br>\
milk]; (S, K; [thus in my copies of the S, and<br>\
in copies of the K; but said in the TA to be<br>\
written in the K and in the copies of the S,<br>\
مُجَيَّبٌ, which is evidently wrong;]) as though<br>\
called, and answering the call. (JM.)<br>\
