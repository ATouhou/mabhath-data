طَفَّ, (As, O, K,) [aor., app.,<br>\
طَفِ3َ,] inf. n.<br>\
طَفٌّ, (TK, [or, accord. to Freytag طُفُوفٌ, which see<br>\
in what follows,]) It (a thing) was, or became, near.<br>\
(As, O, K.) You say, أَخَذْتُ مِنْ مَتَاعِى مَا خَفَّ<br>\
وَطَفَّ i. e. [I took, of my goods,] what [was light,<br>\
and] was near to me. (As, O.) And طَفَّ الشَّىْءُ مِنَ<br>\
الشَّىْءِ The thing was, or became, near to the<br>\
thing. (O, K. *) And خُذْ مَا طَفَّ لَكَ, and<br>\
لَكَ ↓ اسْتَطَفَّ, (S, Meyd, O, K,) and لَكَ ↓ أَطَفَّ,<br>\
(Meyd, O, TA,) Take thou what has risen to<br>\
thee, and become within thy power or reach, (S,<br>\
O, K, TA,) and become attainable [to thee], or<br>\
prepared [for thee], (AZ, Meyd, TA,) and become near to thee: (K, TA:) or what has risen<br>\
to view, and has appeared, [to thee,] to be taken:<br>\
(TA:) [for] طَفَّ, inf. n. طُفُوفٌ, signifies it rose<br>\
[app. so as to become visible]: and it was, or<br>\
became, little in quantity: the saying is a prov.,<br>\
relating to a man&#39;s being content with a part of<br>\
that which he wants: (Meyd:) and in like<br>\
manner one says, خُذْ مَا دَفَّ لَكَ, and اسْتَدَفَّ:<br>\
(AZ, Meyd, TA:) and Ks mentions, in relation<br>\
to a man&#39;s being content with a part of that<br>\
which he wants, the saying, خُذْ مَا طَفَّ لَكَ وَدَعْ<br>\
لَكَ ↓ مَا اسْتَطَفَّ [app. meaning, if the saying be<br>\
correctly thus related, Take what is within thy<br>\
power, or reach, and leave what has risen to thy<br>\
view so as to invite approach]; i. e. be content with what is within thy power. (TA.) ―<br>\

―<br>\
-b4-  مَرَّيَطفُّ [app. يَطِفٌّ] He passed by hastening,<br>\
or going quickly. (O.)<br>\

-b2-  طَفَّهُ He (a man, O) raised it<br>\
(i. e. a thing, O) with his leg or foot, or with his<br>\
arm or hand. (O, K.) And طَفَّ بِفُلَانٍ مَوْضِعَ<br>\
كَذَا He raised such a one to such a place; and<br>\
made him to be on a level with it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
طَفَّ الحَائِطَ, inf. n. طَفٌّ, He mounted upon the<br>\
wall. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
طفّف He made defective, or deficient. (TA.)<br>\
You say, طفّف, (K,) or طفّف المِكْيَالَ, and<br>\
المِيزَانَ, (Msb,) inf. n. تَطْفِيفٌ, (S, O, Msb,) He<br>\
gave short measure, and short weight; (Msb;)<br>\
he made the contents of the measure to be defective,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K,) and in like manner, of the<br>\
balance; (Msb;) not filling the former to its<br>\
uppermost parts: (S, TA:) i. e. he did thus,<br>\
cheating his companion in measure or in weight.<br>\
(TA.) [Hence,] طفّف عَلَى عِيَالِهِ (tropical:)  He scanted<br>\

parsimonious towards them, in expenditure. (TA.)<br>\

than he had taken from him. (TA.) And<br>\

-b2-  Also He made full, or complete. (TA.) [Thus it has two contr. significations.]<br>\
-A2-  طفّفت الشَّمْسُ (tropical:)  The sun drew near<br>\
to setting: (TA:) [but this may be a mistranscription for ↓ طَفَّت, mentioned by Golius in this<br>\
sense on the authority of Z: or each may be<br>\
correct: that the latter is correct, and that<br>\
↓ طَفَافٌ or ↓ طِفَافٌ is its inf. n., seems to be indicated by the fact that SM adds immediately<br>\
after the explanation of the former phrase,]<br>\
أَتَانَا عِنْدَ طفافِ الشَّمْسِ means (tropical:)  [He came to us]<br>\
at the sun&#39;s drawing near to setting. (TA.) ―<br>\

Ibn-&#39;Abbád. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And طفّف بِهِ الفَرَسُ (tropical:)  The<br>\
horse leaped with him. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.<br>\
[Golius has omitted this; and has assigned to<br>\
طفّف, followed by ب with the person who is the<br>\
object, as on the authority of the S and K, the<br>\
signification of ادنا (properly أَدْنَى), meaning<br>\
“ prope admovit,” a signification belonging to<br>\
أَطَفَّ, but not assigned to either of these verbs in<br>\
the S nor in the K.]) طَفَّفَ بِىَ الفَرَسُ مَسْجِدَ بَنِى<br>\
زُرَيْقٍ, in a saying of Ibn-&#39;Omar respecting a<br>\
horse-race, means (tropical:)  The horse leaped with me<br>\
(S, O, TA) so that he passed beyond the mosque<br>\

K:) or what remains in it after the wiping off<br>\
of the head thereof: (M, K: [the measure being<br>\
generally in the form of a truncated cone, much<br>\
smaller at the top than at the base, the quantity<br>\
rising above the top is not much:]) or the<br>\
جِمَام or جَمَام or جُمَام (accord. to different<br>\

the صاع; (S, * Mgh, O;) i. e. ye are all nearly<br>\
alike; so says Az: (Mgh:) meaning, all of you,<br>\
in being related to one father, are in one predicament in respect of defectiveness, like the<br>\
thing measured that falls short of filling the<br>\
measure: (IAth, Mgh, O:) the Prophet then<br>\
proceeded to inform them that there is no excellence of one above another except by piety.<br>\

دَفٌّ, as epithets applied to a horse, are alike (O,<br>\
K) in meaning (K) [app. signifying Light, brisk,<br>\
or quick: (see طَفَّفَ بِهِ الفَرَسُ:) in the TK, and<br>\

meaning “ the side of the thing: ” the pl. occurs<br>\
in the Kur lxxxiii. 1. (TA.)<br>\
