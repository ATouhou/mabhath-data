الشَّمْسُ The sun rose: (O, K:) so says Fr in his<br>\
“ Nawádir. ” (O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And, (O, K,) accord. to<br>\
Zj, (O,) The sun became red on the occasion of<br>\
setting; and so ↓ أَطْفَلَت: (O, K:) thus the<br>\
former has two contr. meanings: (K:) and<br>\
الشَّمْس ↓ طفّلت, (S, K,) or طفّلت لِلْغُرُوبِ, (S,)<br>\
inf. n. تَطْفِيلٌ, (S, O,) The sun inclined to setting:<br>\
(S, O:) or approached the setting; as also<br>\

one&#39;s tail, and pushed him on with her head; and<br>\
went before him, and waited for him until he<br>\
overtook her; and sometimes gently urged him on,<br>\
and followed him]; (K accord. to different<br>\
copies; [but both of these verbs signify the same,<br>\
as expl. in the L;]) and so ↓ طَفَلَت, (K, TA,)<br>\

looked to what would, or might, be its result; or<br>\
he thought, or meditated, upon it, and endeavoured<br>\

اطفلت, said of a woman, (S, O, TA,) and<br>\
of a girl, or young woman, (صبية, [but this, I<br>\

to a girl, or young woman, (S,) or to a woman:<br>\
(O:) and pl. طِفَالٌ and طُفُولٌ, (K.) One says<br>\
بَنَانٌ طَفْلٌ [Soft, or tender, fingers, or ends of<br>\
fingers]; this being allowable, though بنان is a<br>\
[kind of] pl. and طفل is a sing., because every<br>\
pl. [of the kind] that differs not from its sing.<br>\
save in the ة [affixed to the latter] is made sing.<br>\
and masc. [as well as fem.]: and therefore<br>\
Homeyd says,<br>\
فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَ اللِّبْسَ عَنْهُ مَسَحْنَهُ<br>\
بِأَطْرَافِ طَفْلٍ زَانَ غَيْلًا مُوَشَّمًا<br>\

being and of a beast: (Msb:) or (K) a new-born<br>\
child, or young infant: and also a young one, or<br>\
the young, of any wild animal: (S, O, K:) or it<br>\
is applied to a child until he discriminates;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) after which he is called صَبِىّ; thus<br>\
some say, (Msb,) [and] thus says El-Munáwee:<br>\
(TA:) or, accord. to Az, (Msb, TA,) on the<br>\
authority of AHeyth, (TA,) a child from the<br>\
time of his birth (Mgh, TA) until he attains to<br>\

and ↓ طِفْيَلٌ signifies the same as طِفْلٌ; (K,<br>\
TA;) used in this sense by a rájiz; but accord.<br>\
to some, by poetic license, for the dim. ↓ طُفَيْلٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\

the CK سَقَط]) of fire: (M, K, TA:) or a live<br>\
coal: (A, TA:) or fire when just struck; as also<br>\
طِفْلَةٌ: (T, TA: [but this latter is the n. un.:])<br>\
and the pl. is أَطْفَالٌ: one says, تَطَايَرَتْ أَطْفَالُ,<br>\
النَّارِ, meaning (tropical:)  The sparks of the fire [became<br>\

one ” or “ youngling: ” (O:) or طَفَلُ الغَدَاةِ<br>\
signifies the period from that when the sun is<br>\
about to rise, or appear, until its light has<br>\

yet ascendancy in, or upon, the earth: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or the period from the rising, or<br>\
appearing, of the sun, until its having ascendancy<br>\
[for إِلَى اسْتِكْمَالِهَا in a copy of the M, and<br>\
استكمانها and استكنانها in different copies of the K,<br>\
I read الى اسْتِمْكَانِهَا, agreeably with the explanation in the the T and with that of Er-Rághib, in<br>\

-b3-  Also The coming of<br>\
the night with its darkness. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And The<br>\
darkness itself. (O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Rain: so in<br>\
the phrase طَفَلُ الثُّرَيَّا [The rain of the auroral<br>\

showers of the [rain called] وسمىّ [q. v.] fell:<br>\
and جَادَهُ طَفَلٌ مِنْ مَطَرٍ [A shower of rain<br>\

طِفْئِلٌ: see طَفِيلٌ.<br>\
طِفْيَلٌ: see طِفْلٌ.<br>\
طَفَالَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
طُفُولَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
طُفُولِيَّةٌ, mentioned by ISd and the expositors<br>\
of the Fs and others, as well as in the K, and<br>\
also pronounced without teshdeed, [i. e. طُفُولِيَةٌ,]<br>\
which shows, as do several other reasons, that<br>\
the ى therein is not that which is the characteristic of rel. ns., though it has been asserted to be<br>\
so, (MF, TA,) The state, or condition, of the<br>\
طِفْل; [i. e. early infancy: or, in a larger sense,<br>\
childhood;] as also ↓ طُفُولَةٌ and ↓ طَفَالَةٌ and<br>\

طُفَيْلِىٌّ One who intrudes at feasts, uninvited;<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ طِفْلِيلٌ: (K:) the<br>\

who used to intrude at feasts, uninvited, (ISk, S,<br>\
O, Msb,) and who was called طُفَيْلُ الأَعْرَاسِ and<br>\

tions are mentioned in the TA; but they are<br>\
too far-fetched to deserve notice:]) such the Arabs<br>\
[in their proper language] called وَارِشٌ. (ISk,<br>\
S, O, Msb.)<br>\
طَفَّالٌ One who sells طَفْل [or fullers&#39; earth].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
طِفْلِيلٌ: see طُفَيْلِىٌّ.<br>\
[<br>\
طَافِلَةٌ, which Golius explains as meaning “ i. q.<br>\
فَايِدَةٌ et خَيْرٌ, utilitas, bonum,” referring to the<br>\
KL as his authority, is evidently a mistake for<br>\
طَائِلٌ, expl. as meaning فَائِدَةٌ and خَيْرٌ in my<br>\
copy of the KL, which does not mention طَافِلَةٌ<br>\
in any sense.]<br>\
أَطْفَلُ [More, or most, like to the طُفَيْلِىّ: and<br>\
hence, more, and most, intrusive, uninvited]. أَطْفَلُ<br>\
مِنْ لَيْلٍ عَلَى نَهَارٍ [More intrusive, uninvited, than<br>\
night upon day], and مِنْ شَيْبٍ عَلَى شَبَابٍ [than<br>\
hoariness upon youthfulness], and مِنْ ذُبَابٍ [than<br>\
flies], are proverbs. (Meyd.)<br>\

(A &#39;Obeyd, TA,) i. q. ذَاتُ طِفْلٍ [Having a young<br>\
one, or youngling, &amp;c.], (A &#39;Obeyd, K, TA,) with<br>\
her: (A &#39;Obeyd, TA:) or applied to a she-gazelle<br>\
and camel, (S, O,) or to any female, (Msb,) that<br>\
has recently brought forth: (S, O, Msb: *) pl.<br>\
مَطَافِلُ and مَطَافِيلُ. (A &#39;Obeyd, S, O, K.) [See<br>\
also عَائِذٌ, in art. عوذ.] سَارَتْ قُرَيْشٌ بِالعُوذِ المَطَافِيلِ<br>\
i. e. Kureysh journeyed with the camels that had<br>\
recently brought forth having with them their<br>\

(S, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. طُفُوٌّ (S, Mgh, Msb, K)<br>\
and طَفْوٌ, (S, Msb, K,) It (a thing, S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb) floated upon the water, (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K,) and did not sink. (S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
one says, الظُّعُنُ تَطْفُو وَتَرْسُبُ فِى السَّرَابِ (assumed tropical:)  [The<br>\
women&#39;s camel-vehicles appear, as though floating,<br>\
and disappear, as though sinking, in the mirage].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And طَفَتِ الخُوصَةُ فَوْقَ الشَّجَرِ (tropical:)  [The<br>\

طَفَوْتُ فَوْقَهُ (assumed tropical:)  I leaped upon it. (TA.) The<br>\
saying<br>\
عَبْدٌ إِذَا مَا رَسَبَ القَوْمُ طَفَا<br>\
is expl. by IAar as meaning [A slave] who, when<br>\
the people are grave, leaps by reason of his ignorance. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And طَفَا المَآءُ [not a mistranscription for طَغَا] (assumed tropical:)  The water rose, or became<br>\
high. (TA voce طُوفَانٌ, q. v.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And طَفَا said<br>\
of a gazelle, (assumed tropical:)  He ran vehemently. (K.) One<br>\
says of a gazelle, مَرَّ يَطْفُو, meaning (tropical:)  He passed<br>\
by, or along, or away, going lightly, or briskly,<br>\
upon the ground, and running vehemently. (S,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And, said of a man, (K, TA,) by way<br>\
of comparison [to a floating fish], (TA,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
died. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And (assumed tropical:)  He (i. e. a man) entered<br>\

to the “ Nawádir,” one says, طَفَا فِى الأَرْضِ he<br>\

(TA.)<br>\
طُفْىٌ: see طُفْيَةٌ.<br>\

(TA,) A thin, or slender, plant. (K.)<br>\
طُفْوَةٌ: see what next precedes: ―<br>\

and the pl. properly so termed is] طُفًى, (Msb,)<br>\
which is [also] pl. of طُفْوَةٌ. (As, TA.) [Accord.<br>\
to Forskål (Flora Ægypt. Arab., p. cxxvi.), the<br>\
Theban palm itself, which he terms “ borassus<br>\
flabelliformis,” is called طفى, as well as دوم.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] الطُّفْيَةُ, (K,) or ذُو الطُّفْيَتَيْنِ,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) is the name of (assumed tropical:)  A serpent<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K) of a foul, or malignant, sort,<br>\
