طَعِمَهُ, aor.<br>\
طَعَمَ, inf. n. طَعْمٌ and طَعَامٌ, He ate<br>\
it; namely, food: (K, * TA:) and طَعِمَ, aor. as<br>\
above, inf. n. طُعْمٌ, with damm, he tasted [a<br>\
thing]: (K:) or طَعِمَ, aor. as above, (S, Mgh, *<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. طُعْمٌ, with damm, (S,) or طَعْمٌ,<br>\
with fet-h, (Msb,) or both, (Mgh,) and مَطْعَمٌ<br>\
also is an inf. n. of the same verb, (TA,) signifies<br>\
he ate, (S, Mgh, Msb, *) a thing, (Mgh,) and<br>\
[app. also he swallowed, for it is said that] it<br>\
applies to anything that is swallowed easily or<br>\
agreeably, even to water: (Msb:) and he tasted<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb) a thing; (Mgh, Msb;) as also<br>\
↓ تطعّم; (S, Mgh, K;) [i. e.] this latter verb<br>\
signifies he tasted food in order that he might<br>\
know its flavour; and so ↓ استطعم: (Msb:) and<br>\
طَعِمَ as meaning he tasted may be used in relation<br>\
to that which is eaten and to that which is drunk.<br>\
(L.) Hence, in the Kur [xxxiii. 53], فَإِذَا طَعِمْتُمْ<br>\
فَانْتَشِرُوا And when ye shall have eaten [disperse<br>\
yourselves]. (S, * TA.) And you say, فُلَانٌ قَلَّ<br>\
طُعْمُهُ, meaning [Such a one,] his eating [was, or<br>\
became, little]. (S.) The saying in the Kur [ii.<br>\
250], وَمَنْ لَمْ يَطْعَمْهُ فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّى means But whoso<br>\
does not taste it, (S, Msb, * TA,) he is of my<br>\
followers, (Bd, Jel,) or is at one, or in union,<br>\
with me: (Bd:) or, accord. to Zj, the meaning<br>\
is, بِهِ ↓ لَمْ يَتَطَعَّمْ [app. meaning does not refresh<br>\
himself with it as though with food]: (TA:) or,<br>\
as some say, the passage in which it occurs<br>\
denotes a prohibition to take aught save as much<br>\
as is laded out with the hand; and when water<br>\
has with it something that is chewed, one says of<br>\
it يُطْعَمُ. (Er-Rághib, TA.) تَطْعَمْ ↓ تَطَعَّمْ i. e.<br>\
Taste thou, (S, Mgh, K,) then thou wilt have<br>\
desire, or appetence, (Mgh,) or so that thou<br>\
mayest have desire, or appetence, and mayest<br>\
eat; (S, K;) or taste thou the food, for it will<br>\
induce thee to eat it; (IB, TA;) is a prov.,<br>\
(IB, Mgh, TA,) said to him who refrains from<br>\
an affair; meaning, commence it, for thy doing<br>\
so will invite thee to finish it. (IB, TA.) ―<br>\

or gave him food; (Msb, K;) [and so, accord.<br>\
to modern usage, ↓ طعّمهُ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] اطعمهُ<br>\
signifies also (tropical:)  He supplied him with the means of<br>\
subsistence: whence, in the Kur [li. 57], وَمَا أُرِيدُ<br>\
أَنْ يَطْعِمُونِ i. e. (tropical:)  And I desire not that [they,<br>\
meaning] any of my servants should supply me<br>\
