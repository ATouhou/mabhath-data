الدِّرْعِ ↓ مَطَاوِى signifies the creases of the coat of<br>\
mail when it is drawn together, or contracted.<br>\
(TA.) [Hence,] one says, عَلَى جَبِينِهَا أَطْوَآءُ النَّجْمِ<br>\
i. e. طَرَائِقُهُ [app. meaning Upon her forehead (for<br>\
so جَبِين sometimes signifies) are the wrinkles<br>\
indicative of the time for the payment of the debt<br>\

occurring in the lexicons &amp;c. in this sense.]<br>\
طِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph, first<br>\
sentence.<br>\

طَيَّةً وَاحِدَةً [He folded it, &amp;c., with one folding<br>\
&amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
طِيَّةٌ, (S, TA,) from طَوَيْتُ الشَّىْءَ, (S,) is like<br>\
جِلْسَةٌ (S, TA) and رِكْبَةٌ (S) and مِشْيَةٌ, signifying A mode, or manner, of folding &amp;c.; and a<br>\
mode, or manner, of being folded &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
One says, إِنَّهُ لَحَسَنُ الطِّيَّةِ [Verily he is good in<br>\
respect of the mode, or manner, of folding, &amp;c.].<br>\
(K, TA.) And طَوَاهُ طِيَّةً جَيِّدَةً [He folded it,<br>\
&amp;c., in a good mode, or manner, of doing<br>\
so]. (TA.) And hence the saying of Dhu-rRummeh,<br>\

[Like as the writings, or letters, are unfolded<br>\
after the folding in a particular manner]: (S,<br>\

place of alighting or abode [to which one purposes<br>\
repairing, or betaking himself], and it may mean<br>\
an object of aim or purpose or intention [whatever<br>\
it be]: (S:) and in the A it is expl. as meaning<br>\
the direction towards which countries are traversed: (TA:) one says طِيَّةٌ بَعِيدَةٌ i. e. [A place<br>\
of alighting or abode &amp;c.] that is distant, or<br>\
remote: and بَعُدَتْ عَنَّا طِيَّتُهُ i. e. The place of alighting, or of abode, to which he purposed repairing [was<br>\
distant, or remote]: and مَضَى لِطِيَّتِهِ i. e. [He<br>\
went] to his نِيَّة [meaning either place of alighting<br>\
&amp;c. or object of aim &amp;c.] that he purposed: (S:)<br>\
and لَقِيتُهُ بِطِيَّاتِ العِرَاقِ i. e. [I met him in] the<br>\
regions, or quarters, or directions, of El-&#39;Irak:<br>\
and sometimes it is pronounced طِيَةٌ, without<br>\

need. (TA.) [Therefore مَضَى لِطِيَّتِهِ may be<br>\
rendered He went to accomplish his object of want<br>\

voce خَطْرَةٌ, q. v.]. (TA in art. خطر.)<br>\

(K;) as also ↓ طَىٌّ: or the former signifies a<br>\
skin (سقآء) that has been folded having in it its<br>\
moisture, and has consequently become dissundered;<br>\
app. an inf. n. [of طَوِىَ] used as a subst. [properly<br>\
so called]: and ↓ سِقَآءٌ طَوٍ signifies [the same, or]<br>\
a skin that has been folded having in it moisture,<br>\
or some remains of milk, in consequence of which<br>\
it has become altered, and stinking, and dissundered<br>\
by putrefaction. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Hunger; (S;)<br>\
[and] so ↓ طَوٌّ [if not a mistranscription]. (TA.<br>\
[See طَوِىَ, of which the former is an inf. n., as<br>\
also طِوًى.])<br>\
طُوًى is said by some to be like ↓ طِوًى, meaning A thing twice done [as though folded]; and<br>\
to be thus in the Kur [xx. 12 and lxxix. 16];<br>\
meaning twice sanctified [referring to the valley<br>\
there mentioned]; (S, TA; [and thus expl., and<br>\
said to be like ثِنًى, in the Ksh and by Bd;]) or,<br>\
as El-Hasan says, twice blest and sanctified: (S,<br>\
TA:) or meaning twice called [referring to the<br>\
calling of Moses mentioned in the context]. (Ksh<br>\
and Bd in xx. 12, and in like manner says Er-Rághib.) [But طُوَى (as most pronounce it) or<br>\
طُوًى, in the Kur, is generally held to be the name<br>\
of a certain valley. Golius explains طُوًى and<br>\
طِوًى as meaning “ Plicata, plicabilis, res; ”<br>\
which is a mistake: and he adds, “Ambulatio,<br>\
incessus reciprocatus, ultro citroque in se rediens: ” for the latter of these explanations, both of<br>\
which he gives as on the authority of J and the<br>\
K, I am quite unable to account.]<br>\

but may be made fem. to accord. with the meaning [i. e. بِئْرٌ]: (M, TA:) pl. أَطْوَآءٌ: accord. to the<br>\
K, ↓ طَوِيَّةٌ signifies a well; but [SM says] I have<br>\
not seen that any one has mentioned this. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And A سَاعَة [meaning short portion] of the<br>\
