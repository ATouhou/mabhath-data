طلّف عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. تَطْلِيفٌ; (O, K;) and<br>\
ظلّف is a dial. var. thereof; (TA;) He exceeded<br>\
it; (O, K;) [meaning a certain number of years;<br>\
for] it is like ذَرَّفَ and رَمَّثَ and طَلَّثَ. (IAar,<br>\
TA in art. ظلف.)<br>\

اطلف [He escaped being a victim of his<br>\
adversary&#39;s blood-revenge; expl. as meaning] the<br>\
blood-revenge of his adversary was ineffectual, or<br>\
had not effect. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  اطلفهُ He<br>\
made it [i. e. a man&#39;s blood] to go for nothing<br>\
[i. e. unretaliated, or uncompensated by a mulct];<br>\
or to be of no account. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He<br>\
gave him (S, O, K) a thing (O) as a free gift.<br>\
(S, O, K.)<br>\
طَلْفٌ: see the next paragraph in two places.<br>\
طَلَفٌ A thing that goes for nothing; [as blood<br>\
that is unretaliated, or uncompensated by a<br>\
mulct;] that is of no account, ineffectual, or null;<br>\
syn. هَدَرٌ; (S, O, K;) [and so ↓ طَلْفٌ, as shown<br>\
by what follows;] as also ↓ طَلِيفٌ. (O, K.)<br>\
You say, ذَهَبَ دَمُهُ طَلَفًا, (AA, S, O, K,) and<br>\
↓ طَلْفًا, (AA, O, K,) and ظَلَفًا and ظَلْفًا, (AA,<br>\
O,) His blood went for nothing; as a thing of no<br>\
account; ineffectually; or in vain; unretaliated,<br>\
or uncompensated by a mulct; syn. هَدَرًا, (AA,<br>\
S, O, K, TA,) and بَاطِلًا: and in like manner,<br>\
مَالُهُ [his property]. (TA. [See also تَلَفٌ.])<br>\
And Ru-beh says,<br>\
↓ كَمْ مِنْ عِدًى أَمْوَالُهُمْ طَلِيفُ<br>\
[How many enemies are there whose possessions<br>\
are things that have gone for nought !]. (O, as<br>\
an ex. of the last word in the sense of هَدَر.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And (S, O, K) hence (O) A gift; (S, O, K;) a<br>\
gift freely bestowed, not for any compensation.<br>\
(S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A thing that is easy; or of<br>\
light estimation, paltry, or despicable; [as also<br>\
ظَلَفٌ;] syn. هَيِّنٌ. (IF, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A redundant portion of a thing: (IF, O, K:) if this<br>\
be not what is meant by the saying that طَلَفٌ is<br>\
syn. with فَضْلٌ, this saying is of no account.<br>\
(IF, O.)<br>\
طَلِيفٌ: see طَلَفٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A<br>\
thing that is taken. (O, K. *) [And hence,<br>\
perhaps, the saying of Ru-beh cited above.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
One says also, ذَهَبَ فُلَانٌ بِالمَالِ طَلِيفًا and ظَلِيفًا<br>\
i. e. Such a one went away with the property<br>\
without compensation. (Yoo, O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And أَكَلَ<br>\
مَالَهُ فِى طَلِيف He devoured his property in a<br>\
vain, or an ineffectual, procedure. (O.)<br>\
