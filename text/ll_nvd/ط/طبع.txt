طَبَعَ, aor.<br>\
طَبَعَ, inf. n. طَبْعٌ, He sealed, stamped,<br>\
imprinted, or impressed; syn. خَتَمَ: (Msb:)<br>\
[and, as now used, he printed a book or the<br>\
like:] تَبْعٌ and خَتْمٌ both signify the making an<br>\
impression in, or upon, clay and the like: (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, K:) or, as Er-Rághib says, the impressing a thing with the engraving of the signet and<br>\
stamp: (TA in this art. and in art. ختم: [see<br>\
more in the first paragraph of the latter art:])<br>\
and he says also that طَبْعٌ signifies the figuring a<br>\
thing with some particular figure; as in the case<br>\
of the طَبْع of the die for stamping coins, and the<br>\
طَبْع of coins [themselves]: but that it is more<br>\
general in signification than خَتْمٌ, and more<br>\
particular than نَقْشٌ; as will be shown by what<br>\
follows: accord. to Aboo-Is-hák the Grammarian, طَبْعٌ and خَتْمٌ both signify the covering<br>\
over a thing, and securing oneself from a thing&#39;s<br>\
entering it: and IAth says [in like manner] that<br>\
they held طَبْعٌ to be syn. with رَيْنٌ [inf. n. of<br>\
رَانَ]: but Mujáhid says that رَيْنٌ denotes less<br>\
than طَبْعٌ; and طَبْعٌ, less than إِقْفَالٌ [or the<br>\
“ closing with a lock: ” this he says with reference to a phrase in the Kur xlvii. 26]. (TA.)<br>\
You say, طَبَعَ الكِتَابَ, (Mgh, Msb,) and طَبَعَ عَلَى<br>\
الكِتَابِ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *) He sealed (خَتَمَ, S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) the writing, or letter. (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb.) And طَبَعَ He branded, or otherwise<br>\
marked, the sheep, or goat. (O. [See طَابَعٌ.])<br>\
And طَبَعَ اللّٰهُ عَلَى قَلْبِهِ (tropical:)  God sealed [or set a seal<br>\
upon] his [i. e. an unbeliever&#39;s] heart, so that he<br>\
should not heed admonition, nor be disposed to<br>\
that which is good; (Mgh;) or so that belief<br>\
should not enter it: (O:) [and in like manner,<br>\
خَتَمَ عَلَيْهِ, q. v.:] in this, regard is had to the<br>\
طَبْع, and the طَبِيعَة, which is the natural constitution or disposition; for it denotes the characterizing of the soul with some particular quality or<br>\
qualities, either by creation or by habit, and<br>\
more especially by creation. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also He began to make, or manufacture, a<br>\
thing: and he made [a thing] as in instances here<br>\
following. (Mgh.) You say, طَبَعَ مِنَ الطِّينِ<br>\
جَرَّةً He made, [or fashioned, or moulded,] of the<br>\
clay, a jar. (S, O, K.) And طَبَعَ اللَّبِنَ, (Mgh,<br>\
TA,) and السَّيْفَ, (S, Mgh, O, K,) and الدِّرْهَمُ,<br>\
(S, O, K,) He made (S, Mgh, O, K) [the crude<br>\
bricks, and the sword, and the dirhem]: or طَبَعَ<br>\
الدَّرَاهِمَ he struck (Mgh, Msb) with the die (Msb)<br>\
[i. e. coined, or minted,] the dirhems, or money.<br>\
(Mgh, Msb.) And [hence] one says, طَبَقَهُ اللّٰهُ<br>\
عَلَى الأَمْرِ, aor. and inf. n. as above, (assumed tropical:)  God<br>\
created him with an adaptation, or a disposition,<br>\
to the thing, affair, state, condition, or case; or<br>\
adapted him, or disposed him, by creation, [or<br>\
nature], thereto. (TA.) And طُبِعَ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He (a man, O, TA) was created with an adaptation, or a disposition, to the thing; or was<br>\
adapted, or disposed, by creation [or nature],<br>\
thereto; syn. جُبِلَ, (IDrd, O, K, TA,) or فُطِرَ.<br>\
(Lh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (aor. as above, TA, and so<br>\
the inf. n., O, TA,) He filled (Er-Rághib, O, K,<br>\
TA) a measure for corn or the like, (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA,) or a leathern bucket, (O, K, TA,) and a<br>\
skin, (O, TA,) &amp;c.; (O;) and so ↓ طبّع, (S,<br>\
O, K,) inf. n. تَطْبِيعٌ: (S, O:) because the<br>\
quantity that fills it is a sign that prevents the<br>\
taking a portion of what is in it [without the<br>\
act&#39;s being discovered]. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And طَبَعَ قَفَاهُ, (IAar, O, K,) inf. n. as above,<br>\
(IAar, O,) He struck the back of his neck with<br>\
his hand; (IAar, O, K;) i. e. the back of the neck<br>\
of a boy: if with the ends of the fingers, one<br>\
says, قَذَّ قَفَاهُ. (IAar, O.) ―<br>\
-b5-  مَا أَدْرِى مِنْ أَيْنَ طَبَعَ<br>\
means I know not whence he came forth; syn.<br>\
طَلَعَ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  طَبِعَ, (aor.<br>\
طَبَعَ,] inf. n. طَبَعٌ, said<br>\
of a sword, It was, or became, rusty, or overspread with rust: (S:) or very rusty, or overspread with much rust. (K, TA: from an explanation of the aor.: but this is written in the CK<br>\
and in my MS. copy of the K, and in the O,<br>\
يُطْبَعُ. [An explanation of طَبَعٌ in the O and K<br>\
confirms the reading يَطْبَعُ; and another confirmation thereof will be found in what follows in this<br>\
paragraph.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Said of a thing, (Msb,) or of a<br>\
garment, or piece of cloth, (TA,) inf. n. طَبَعٌ, It<br>\
was, or became, dirty; (Msb, TA;) and ↓ تطّبع<br>\
is likewise said [in the same sense] of a garment,<br>\
or piece of cloth. (M and TA voce رَانَ, in art.<br>\
رين.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Said of a man, (assumed tropical:)  He was or became,<br>\
filthy or foul [in character]. (S.) And (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
was, or became, sluggish, lazy, or indolent. (S.)<br>\
One says of a man, يَطْبَعُ, (O, K,) like يَفْرَحُ,<br>\
(K,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  He has no penetrative energy,<br>\
sharpness, or effectiveness, in the affairs that are<br>\
the means, or causes, of attaining honour, like the<br>\
sword that is overspread with much rust. (O, K.)<br>\
-A3-  طُبِعَ, (O, K,) inf. n. طَبْعٌ, (O,) said of a man,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He was rendered [or pronounced] filthy or foul<br>\
[in character]; (O, K;) on the authority of Sh;<br>\
(O;) and so طَبِعَ, like فَرِحَ; (TA as on the<br>\
authority of Sh; [but this I think doubtful;])<br>\
and disgraced, or dishonoured: (K:) and ↓ طُبِّعَ,<br>\
(O, TA,) inf. n. تَطْبِيعٌ, (TA,) he was rendered<br>\
[or pronounced] filthy or foul [in character], (O,<br>\
TA,) and blamed, or discommended. (O.)<br>\
2<br>\
طبّع, inf. n. تَطْبِيعٌ, He sealed well [or much,<br>\
or he sealed a number of writings &amp;c.]. (KL: in<br>\
which only the inf. n. is mentioned.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He<br>\
loaded [a beast heavily, or] well. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See<br>\
also 1, a little after the middle.<br>\
-A2-  تَطْبِيعٌ signifies<br>\
also The rendering unclean, dirty, filthy, or<br>\
impure. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See 1, last sentence.<br>\

natural disposition. (Har p. 236.) You say,<br>\

another&#39;s] natural dispositions. (O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also It (a vessel) became full or filled: (S, O,<br>\
K:) quasi-pass. of طبّعهُ. (S.) And تطبّع بِالمَآءِ<br>\
It (a river, or rivulet,) overflowed its sides with<br>\
the water, and poured it forth abundantly. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  See also 1, last quarter.<br>\
7<br>\
يَذُوبُ وَيَنْطَبِعُ, a phrase of Es-Sarakhsee,<br>\
meaning [It melts, and then] it admits of being<br>\
sealed, stamped, imprinted, or impressed, is allowable on the ground of analogy, though we have<br>\
not heard it [as transmitted from the Arabs of<br>\
pure speech]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Golius has erroneously<br>\
expl. انطبع as meaning “ Mansuetus, edoctus,<br>\
obsequens fuit; ” on the authority of the KL;<br>\
evidently in consequence of his having found its<br>\
inf. n. (اِنْطِبَاعٌ) written in a copy of that work for<br>\
اِنْطِياعٌ, the reading in my own copy.]<br>\
8<br>\

make, fashion, or mould, of this]. (IAar, O, L,<br>\

same kind as the قِرْدَان [or ticks], (O, K,) but<br>\
(O) the bite of which occasions intense pain; (O,<br>\
K;) and sometimes, or often, he that is bitten by<br>\
it becomes swollen [app. in the part bitten], and is<br>\
relieved by sweet things: Az says that it is with<br>\
the Arabs [called, or what is called,] the نِبْر<br>\

resembling the tick, which, when it creeps upon the<br>\
camel, causes the track along which it creeps to<br>\

قَمْقَامَةٌ, which is expl. as applied to a small tick;<br>\
