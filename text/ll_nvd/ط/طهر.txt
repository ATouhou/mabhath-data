طَهَرَ and<br>\
طَهُرَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor. of each<br>\
طَهُرَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. طَهَارَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) which<br>\
is of each verb, (S, Msb,) and طُهْرٌ, (Sb, K,) or<br>\
the latter is a simple subst., (S, Msb,) It was, or<br>\
became, clean, free from dirt or filth, or pure.<br>\
(A, * Msb, K. *) طهارة is of two kinds; [properly]<br>\
corporeal and [tropically] spiritual. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And طَهَرَتْ, (M, Mgh, K,) or طَهَرَتْ مِنَ الحَيْضِ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
طَهُرَ; (Msb;) and طَهُرَتْ, (M, Msb, K,) which<br>\
is allowable, (IAar,) but of rare occurrence,<br>\
(Msb,) and طَهِرَتْ, [which is of more rare occurrence;] (M, El-Isnawee;) inf. n. طُهْرٌ and طَهَارَةٌ<br>\
and طُهُورٌ and طَهُورٌ; (TA;) She was, or became,<br>\
pure from the menstrual discharge; (Mgh;) her<br>\
discharge of blood stopped. (Mgh, K.) See also<br>\

[Verily the ewe, or she-goat, emits a white fluid<br>\
from her womb during ten nights, and then becomes pure,] is mentioned on the authority of<br>\
Lh: but ISd says, whether he mentioned this as<br>\
heard from the Arabs, or did so presumptuously,<br>\
I know not. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  طَهَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
طَهَرَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
طَهْرٌ,) (TK,) signifies He made it, or caused it,<br>\
to be, or become, distant, or remote; syn. أَبْعَدَهُ:<br>\
(O, K:) and so طَحَرَهُ; (O, TA;) the ح being<br>\
substituted for ه. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
طهّرهُ, inf. n. تَطْهِيرٌ, [He cleansed, or purified,<br>\
him, or it:] (S:) and طهّرهُ بِالمَآءِ he washed him,<br>\
or it, with water: (K:) and ↓ أَطْهَرَهُ signifies<br>\
the same as طهّرهُ. (Bd in lvi. 78.) ―<br>\
-b2-  طَهِّرَا بَيْتِى,<br>\
in the Kur [ii. 119], Cleanse ye my house [the<br>\
Kaabeh] of the idols (Aboo-Is-hák, Bd, Jel) and<br>\
impurities; and what does not become it: (Bd:)<br>\
or clear ye it: (Bd:) or cleanse ye my house<br>\
from [pollution by] disobediences and forbidden<br>\
actions: (Az:) or, accord. to some, it means an<br>\
incitement to purify the heart. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  وَثِيَابَكَ<br>\
فَطَهِّرْ, in the Kur [lxxiv. 4], means And cleanse<br>\
thy clothes from dirt: (Jel:) or shorten thy<br>\

trailing along the ground: (Jel, TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  purify<br>\
thy heart: or (assumed tropical:)  thy soul: or (assumed tropical:)  make thy conduct<br>\
right: (TA:) and see other explanations voce<br>\
ثَوْبٌ. ―<br>\

Kur [v. 45], means (assumed tropical:)  God hath not pleased to<br>\

4<br>\
أَطْهَرَ see 2, first sentence.<br>\
5<br>\
تطهّر, inf. n. تَطَهُّرٌ, is sometimes changed into<br>\
اِطَّهَّرَ, inf. n. اِطَّهُّرٌ, the ت being incorporated into<br>\
the ط, and this requiring a conjunctive ا, (Sgh,<br>\
K,) in order that the word may not begin with a<br>\
quiescent letter: (Sgh:) and طَهُورٌ is also an<br>\
inf. n. [or rather a quasi-inf. n.] (Sb, K) of<br>\
تَطَهَّرَ, (Mgh, TA,) like as وَضُوْءٌ is [said to be] of<br>\
تَوَضَّأَ. (TA.) The meaning is, [He became<br>\
cleansed, or purified: or he cleansed, or purified,<br>\
himself: and] he washed himself. (Mgh.) You<br>\
say, تطهّر بِالمَآءِ [He cleansed, or purified, or<br>\
washed, himself with water]: (S:) he performed<br>\
the ablution termed الوُضُوْء: and that termed<br>\
الاِسْتِنْجَآء; (A;) as also تطهّر alone, as used in<br>\
the Kur ix. 109: (Mgh, TA:) and the same<br>\
verb, alone, is expl. as signifying he made use of<br>\
water, or what supplied its place; thus used in<br>\
the Kur v. 9. (TA.) In the Kur vii. 80 and<br>\
xxvii. 57, the verb is used derisively. (TA.)<br>\
You say also, تطهّرت, (Mgh, Msb, K,) and<br>\
اِطَّهَّرَتْ, (Mgh,) meaning, She cleansed, or<br>\
purified, herself by washing, from [the pollution<br>\
of] the menstrual discharge, (Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
&amp;c.; (K;) as also ↓ طَهَرَتْ and طَهُرَتْ; (Msb, *<br>\
K;) agreeably with what is said in the B, that<br>\
طَهَرَ and طَهُرَ and اطّهّر and تطهّر have the same<br>\
signification: (TA:) or تطهّرت and اطّهّرت have<br>\
this signification; but the unaugmented verb has<br>\
the signification first assigned to it, or “ her discharge of blood stopped: ” (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, IAar:)<br>\
in the Kur ii. 222, some read حَتَّى يَطْهُرْنَ; and<br>\
others, حَتَّى يَطَّهَّرْنَ: but the latter reading is the<br>\
preferable, on account of the difference between<br>\
the two forms of the verb, just mentioned:<br>\
(Abu-l-&#39;Abbás:) or the law which allows not<br>\
the touching a woman until she has performed<br>\
the ablution mentioned above shows the two<br>\
forms of the verb to be the same in signification.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  He removed himself far from<br>\
unclean things, or impurities. (S, Mgh, K. *) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
(tropical:)  He refrained from sin, (K, TA,) and from<br>\
what was not good: (TA:) he removed himself<br>\
far from low, or ignoble, habits: and in this<br>\
sense, accord. to some, it is used in the Kur vii.<br>\
80 and xxvii. 57. (TA.) And تطهّر مِنَ الإِثْمِ<br>\
(tropical:)  He removed himself far from sin. (A.)<br>\
طُهْرٌ [see 1: ―<br>\
-b2- ] Cleanness; freedom from dirt<br>\
or filth; or pureness. (S, * Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The state of<br>\
pureness from the menstrual discharge: (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb:) pl. أَطْهَارٌ. (A, Msb.) And the pl.<br>\
signifies The days of a woman&#39;s state of pureness<br>\
from the menstrual discharge. (K.)<br>\
طَهِرٌ: see طَاهِرٌ, in three places.<br>\
طُهْرَةٌ a subst. from التَّطْهِيرُ [and signifying A<br>\
cleansing, or purification: and in this sense it<br>\
was applied by the Christians to baptism]:<br>\
(Mgh:) or from طَهَّرَهُ بِالمَآءِ [and signifying a<br>\
cleansing, or purification, by water]: (K:) or<br>\
cleanness, or pureness. (TK.)<br>\
طَهُورٌ inf. n. of 1; as also طُهُورٌ: (TA:) and<br>\
inf. n. [or rather quasi-inf. n.] of 5. (Sb, Mgh,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A thing [such as water] with which one<br>\
cleanses or purifies: (T, S, Mgh, Msb, K:) a<br>\
word similar to فَطُورٌ and سَحُورٌ and وَقُودٌ: (S:)<br>\
and the author of the “ Matáli&#39; el-Anwár ” mentions طُهُورٌ also in this sense; but this is strange<br>\
and anomalous: (En-Nawawee:) the former occurs<br>\
in the Kur xxv. 50: (S:) or it signifies water<br>\
with which the ablution termed وُضُوْء is performed: (A, IAth:) or it has the signification<br>\
next following. (K.) It is said, التَّوْبَةُ طَهُورٌ<br>\
لِلْمُذْنِبِ (tropical:)  [Repentance is a means of purifying the<br>\
sinner, or criminal]. (A.) Lth says that it is<br>\
that which is [accompanied] by the execution of<br>\
the prescribed punishment, such as stoning &amp;c.<br>\
(TA.) [See also مَطْهَرَةٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  It is also an epithet,<br>\
(Mgh, TA,) and signifies Clean and cleansing,<br>\
or pure and purifying: (Th, T, Mgh, Msb:)<br>\
whatever God has created descending from the<br>\
sky, or welling forth from the earth as a spring<br>\
or river or sea, in which a human being does<br>\
nothing but drawing water, and of which the<br>\
colour is not changed by anything mixing with<br>\
it, nor the taste thereby, is طَهُور: and what is<br>\
otherwise, as the water of roses and of the leaves<br>\
of trees, and what flows from the grape-vine,<br>\
though it be طَاهِر, is not طَهُور: (Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee:)<br>\
the former removes impurities: the latter, if not<br>\
at the same time طَهُور, does not: (TA:) or very<br>\
clean or pure: (A, Msb:) the explanation by<br>\
Th, if meant to show that the word signifies of the<br>\
utmost cleanness or pureness, is correct and good:<br>\
otherwise, it is not so; for فَعُولٌ is not formed<br>\
from تَفْعِيلٌ: (Mgh, O:) it is also explained as<br>\
signifying, simply, cleansing, or purifying: (B,<br>\
TA:) also as syn. with طَاهِرٌ, as in the phrase<br>\
رِيقُهُنَّ طَهُورٌ [their saliva is pure]: but here it is<br>\
either an intensive epithet or used for طَاهِرٌ for<br>\
the sake of the measure. (Msb.)<br>\
طَهِيرٌ: see طَاهِرٌ, in two places.<br>\
طَهَارَةٌ [see 1. ―<br>\
-b2- ] The act of performing the<br>\
ablution termed الغُسْل, and that termed الوُضُوْء,<br>\
and that termed الاِسْتِنْجَآء. (Msb, TA.)<br>\
طُهَارَةٌ What remains of that with which one<br>\
has performed the ablution termed طَهَارَة. (TA.)<br>\
طَهُورِيَّةٌ The quality of being طَهُور. (Msb.)<br>\
طَاهِرٌ Clean; free from dirt or filth; or pure;<br>\
(Msb, K;) as also ↓ طَهِرٌ (IAar, K) and ↓ طَهِيرٌ:<br>\
(M, K:) fem. طَاهِرَةٌ: (S, A, Msb:) pl. (of<br>\
طَاهِرٌ, TA) أَطْهَارٌ (K) and طَهَارَى, (S, K,) which<br>\
latter is anomalous, as though its sing. were<br>\
طَهْرَانُ, (S,) and, applied to men, طَاهِرُونَ: (TA:)<br>\
and (of ↓ طَهِرٌ, TA) طَهِرُونَ; (K;) the only<br>\
form; there being no broken pl.: (TA:) and of<br>\
طَاهِرَةٌ, طَاهِرَاتٌ (TA) and طَوَاهِرُ. (A.) You say,<br>\
رَجُلٌ طَاهِرٌ and ↓ طَهِيرٌ [A clean, or pure, man].<br>\
(O.) And اِمْرَأَةٌ طَاهِرَةٌ مِنَ النَّجَاسَةِ [A woman<br>\
pure from dirt or filth]. (S.) And مَآءٌ طَاهِرٌ<br>\
Clean, or pure, water: and also, fit to cleanse<br>\
or purify with. (Msb.) And ثِيَابٌ طَهَارَى [Clean<br>\
clothes]. (S.) [See also طَهُورٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Pure from<br>\
the menstrual discharge; in this sense without ة:<br>\
(IAar:) as also طَاهِرٌ مِنَ الحَيْضِ. (S, Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  هُوَ طَاهِرُ العِرْضِ (assumed tropical:)  He is clear from vice, or<br>\
fault. (Msb.) اِمْرَأَةٌ طَاهِرَةٌ مِنَ العُيُوبِ (assumed tropical:)  [A<br>\
woman pure from vices, or the like]. (S.) And<br>\
رَجُلٌ طَاهِرُ الثِّيَابِ, (S, A, TA,) and طَاهِرُ الأَثْوَابِ,<br>\
(TA,) (tropical:)  A man free, or far-removed, from low,<br>\
or ignoble, habits: (S, * A, TA:) and in like<br>\
manner, طَاهِرُ الخُلُقِ, and الخُلُقِ ↓ طَهِرُ: fem. طَاهِرَة.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
أَطْهَرُ [More, and most, clean or pure]. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] هُنَّ أَطْهَرُ لَكُمْ [Kur xi. 80] (assumed tropical:)  They are<br>\
more lawful to you. (O, TA.)<br>\
مَطْهَرَةٌ and مِطْهَرَةٌ, (S, A, K, &amp;c.,) the former of<br>\
which is the more approved, (S,) A vessel, (A,<br>\
K,) or any vessel, (Mgh, Msb,) [for purification,<br>\
i. e.,] with which one washes himself, (A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) and performs the ablution termed وُضُوْء,<br>\
such as a سَطْل, or رَكْوَة: (TA:) and (A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K) i. q. إِدَاوَةٌ [a kind of leathern vessel for<br>\
water]: (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K:) pl. مَطَاهِرُ. (S,<br>\
Msb.) Hence, [or from مَطْهَرَةٌ as signifying,<br>\
agreeably with analogy, A means of cleansing or<br>\
purifying,] the saying, (Msb,) السِّوَاكُ مَطْهَرَةٌ لِلْفَمِ<br>\
[The tooth-stick is a means of purifying to<br>\
the mouth]. (S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A house, or<br>\
chamber, in which one washes himself, (K,<br>\
TA,) and performs the ablutions termed وُضُوْء<br>\
and غُسْل and اِسْتِنْجَآء. (TA.)<br>\
صُحُفًا مُطَهَّرَةً, in the Kur [xcviii. 2], signifies<br>\
Writings cleansed from impurities and falsehood.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And أَزْوَاجٌ مُطَهَّرَةٌ, in the same [ii. 23],<br>\
Wives purified from the pollution of the menstrual<br>\
discharge and the other natural evacuations. (O,<br>\

[lvi. 78], is said by some to mean, (assumed tropical:)  None shall<br>\
attain to the knowledge of its true meanings except<br>\
those who have purified themselves from the filth<br>\
of corrupt conduct, and ignorances, and acts of<br>\
disobedience. (TA.)<br>\

signifies And will take thee forth from those who<br>\

doing as they do. (TA.)<br>\
وَيُحِبُّ المُتَطَهِّرِينَ, in the Kur [ii. 222], signifies And He loveth those who purify their spirits.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

1<br>\
طَهَا, aor. يَطْهُو and يَطْهَى, inf. n. طَهْوٌ (S, K)<br>\
and طُهُوٌّ (K) and طَهْىٌ, (S, [so in both of my<br>\
copies,]) or طُهِىٌّ, (K,) and طَهَايَةٌ, thus app.<br>\

طَبْخ [meaning by boiling or stewing or the like],<br>\

said of a man, (S,) He went away into the<br>\

[or] you say, طَهَا فِى الأَرْضِ, inf. n. طَهْوٌ; and<br>\
طَهَى فِى الأَرْضِ, inf. n. طَهْىٌ: both signify the<br>\
same. (TA.) And in like manner, طَهَتِ الإِبِلُ,<br>\
(S, TA,) aor. تَطْهَى, inf. n. طَهْوٌ and طُهُوٌّ, (TA,)<br>\
The camels went away into the country, or in the<br>\

And طَهَى, inf. n. طَهْىٌ, He committed a sin,<br>\
crime, fault, or misdemeanour. (TA. [See also<br>\
طُهًى.])<br>\
4<br>\
اطهى He was, or became, skilled in his<br>\
work, art, or craft. (Az, K.)<br>\
طَهَا is used by Abu-n-Nejm for طٰهٰ meaning<br>\
the Chapter of the Kur-án [thus called, because<br>\
commencing with these two letters, namely, the<br>\
20th,] in his saying,<br>\
مَدَّ لَنَا فِى عُمْرِهِ رَبُّ طَهَا<br>\
[May the Lord of طٰهٰ lengthen for us his life].<br>\

طَهْوٌ [The cooking of flesh-meat: see 1, first<br>\
sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A deed, or a performance. (S, K, TA.) Thus in a trad., (S,<br>\
TA,) in which it is related that it was said to<br>\
Aboo-Hureyreh, “Didst thou hear this from the<br>\
Apostle of God? ” and he replied وَمَا كَانَ طَهْوِى<br>\
i. e. (assumed tropical:)  And what was my deed, or performance?<br>\

in the trad. of Aboo-Hureyreh [mentioned above]<br>\
is expl. by some as meaning مَا ذَنْبِى [What is<br>\
my fault?]. (TA.)<br>\
طَهَآءٌ, (S, K, TA,) with the lengthened ا, (S,<br>\
TA,) is like طَخَآءٌ; (K, TA; [in some copies of<br>\
the K, each of these is erroneously written with<br>\
the shortened ا, without ء;]) i. e. it is a dial. var.<br>\
of the latter word, signifying High, or elevated,<br>\
clouds: (S, TA:) or thin clouds: (Ham p. 12:<br>\

the sky a portion of cloud. (S.)<br>\

[And would that there were for us, of the water<br>\

طَاهٍ A cook; (S, K;) a roaster, broiler, or<br>\

who qualifies it well, rightly, or properly: (TA:)<br>\
pl. طُهَاةٌ and طُهِىٌّ: (K, TA: [in the CK the<br>\
latter is written طُهًى, which is evidently wrong;<br>\
whereas طُهِىٌّ is agreeable with analogy, being<br>\
originally طُهُوْىٌ:]) the fem. is طَاهِيَةٌ, and its pl.<br>\
