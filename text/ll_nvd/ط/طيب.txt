xiii. 28) and تَطْيَابٌ, (S, K,) [the last of which<br>\
is of a measure denoting intensiveness, and is<br>\
said in the TA to be with fet-h because it is<br>\
unsound, whereas the inf. n. of a sound verb,<br>\
if of the measure تفعال, is with kesr, but this<br>\
is a strange mistake, (see 2 in art. بين,)] It was,<br>\
or became, the contr. of خَبِيث, (S, Mgh,) in two<br>\
senses: (Mgh:) [i. e.] it was, or became, [good,]<br>\
pleasant, delightful, delicious, sweet, or savoury;<br>\

and without anger. (TA.) And فَعَلْتُ ذٰلِكَ<br>\
بِطِيبَةِنَفْسٍ (assumed tropical:)  I did that [of my own free will;<br>\
willingly;] not being constrained by any one. (S,<br>\
O.) And طَابَتْ نَفْسِى عَلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  [My mind was<br>\
agreeable to it]; said when a thing is agreeable,<br>\
or suitable, to one&#39;s mind; and [in like manner]<br>\
طِبْتُ نَفْسًا عَلَيْهِ. (TA.) And طَابَتْ نَفْسُهُ لِلْعَمَلِ<br>\

K) and طِيبَةٌ, (K,) (tropical:)  It was, or became, lawful,<br>\
allowable, or free. (A, O, Msb, K, * TA.) [In<br>\
the K, الطِّيبُ and الطِّيبَةُ are expl. as meaning<br>\
الحِلُّ, which Golius has supposed to mean in this<br>\
case “ quod licitum, legitimum; ” and which<br>\
Freytag has in like manner expl. as meaning<br>\
“ res licita,” and “ licitum: ” but it is here an<br>\
inf. n., of حَلَّ; not syn. with the epithet الحَلَالُ,<br>\
which is given as an explanation of الطَّيِّبُ.]<br>\
You say, طَابَ لِى كَذَا (tropical:)  Such a thing became,<br>\

it, accord. to the dial. of Himyer, (TA,) meaning<br>\

طيّب نَفْسَهُ, which latter is a phrase of frequent<br>\
occurrence, (assumed tropical:)  He placated, or soothed, his mind;]<br>\
he spoke to him pleasantly, sweetly, or blandly.<br>\
(TA.) And طَيَّبْتَ نَفْسِى عَنْكَ (assumed tropical:)  [Thou hast made<br>\

بِهِ, and أَيْطِبْ بِهِ, are all allowable [as meaning<br>\
How good, pleasant, delightful, delicious, or sweet,<br>\

doubtful,]) He found it, (S, K,) or saw it,<br>\
(Msb,) to be طَيِّب [i. e. good, pleasant, &amp;c.].<br>\
(S, Msb, K.) One says, استطاب فُلَانٌ الدِّيمَةَ<br>\
[Such a one found, or saw, to be good, or pleasant,<br>\
the lasting and still rain]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And استطاب,<br>\
(S, A, O, Msb, K,) or استطاب نَفْسَهُ, (TA,) and<br>\

means And when they asked for sweet water [the<br>\

it is also expl. agreeably with what here follows.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  He (a man) drank طَابَة [i. e. wine]:<br>\

طَابٌ is an inf. n. of طَابَ, (K,) and syn. with<br>\
طِيبٌ and also with طَيِّبٌ, q. v.: a poet says,<br>\
praising &#39;Omar Ibn-&#39;Abd-El-&#39;Azeez,<br>\
مُقَابَلُ الإِعْرَاقِ فِى الطَّابِ الطَّابْ<br>\
بَيْنَ أَبِى العَاصِى وَآلِ الخَطَّابْ<br>\
[i. e. Rooted by the father&#39;s and the mother&#39;s side<br>\
in unsullied goodness, or the like, between Abu-l-<br>\
&#39;Ásee on the one side and the family of ElKhattáb on the other: for it is evidently cited<br>\
as an ex. of الطاب used as a subst. and as an<br>\
epithet; so that by فى الطاب الطاب is meant فى<br>\
الطِّيبِ الطَّيِّبِ: otherwise it might be supposed<br>\
that the literal repetition is meant to denote<br>\
simply corroboration, as appears to be the case<br>\
in an instance which will be mentioned in what<br>\
follows:] the object of praise being the son of<br>\
&#39;Abd-El-&#39;Azeez the son of Marwán the son of<br>\
El-Hakam the son of Abu-l-&#39;Ás [or &#39;Ásee], and<br>\
his mother being Umm-&#39;Ásim the daughter of<br>\
&#39;Ásim the son of &#39;Omar the son of El-Khattáb.<br>\

-b2-  عَذْقُ ابْنِ طَابٍ is the name of A sort<br>\
of palm-trees in El-Medeeneh [app. so called<br>\
because of the sweetness of their fruit, or طاب<br>\
may in this instance be for طَابَة, a name of ElMedeeneh]: (K:) or, as also رُطَبُ ابْنِ طَابٍ, a<br>\
sort of dates of El-Medeeneh: (S, O:) or اِبْنُ<br>\
طَابٍ is a name of a sort of fresh ripe dates: (K:)<br>\
and عَذْقُ ابْنِ طَابٍ and عَذْقُ ابْنِ زَيْدٍ are two<br>\
sorts of dates: (S:) accord. to IAth, رُطَبُ ابْنِ<br>\
طَابٍ is the name of a sort of dates of El-Medeeneh<br>\
so called in relation to Ibn-Táb, a man of its inhabitants. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  طاب طاب is [asserted to<br>\
be] One of the names of the Prophet in the Gospel; [but where said to occur, I know not;] the<br>\
interpretation of مأذ مأذ; [app. a mistranscription<br>\
for مَاذ مَاذ, meaning “ very good in disposition,”<br>\
&amp;c.;] the second word corroborating, and denoting<br>\
intensiveness of signification. (TA.)<br>\
طُوبٌ, mentioned in this art. in the S and K,<br>\
[as though it were originally طُيْبٌ,] see in art.<br>\
طوب.<br>\
طِيبٌ an inf. n. of طَابَ. (O, Mgh, * Msb, K.)<br>\
[Used as a simple subst., Goodness, pleasantness,<br>\
&amp;c.] You say, مَا بِهِ مِنَ الطِّيبِ [There is not in<br>\
him aught of goodness, &amp;c.]: you should not say,<br>\
من الطِّيبَةِ. (S, O.) [See also طَابٌ: and طُوبَى.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Also] a word of well-known meaning; (K;)<br>\
[A perfume; a fragrant, or an odoriferous, substance;] a substance with which one perfumes<br>\
himself, (S, O, Msb,) of what is termed عِطْر.<br>\
(Msb.) [The pl. accord. to Golius and Freytag<br>\
is أَطْيَابٌ. Hence, جَوْزُ الطِّيبِ The nutmeg: see<br>\
جوز.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The most excellent of any sort of<br>\
thing. (K.) [See also أَطْيَبُ: and طَيِّبَةٌ.]<br>\
طَابَةٌ Wine: (S, O, K:) as though meaning<br>\
طَيِّبَةٌ; and originally طَيَبَةٌ: (AM, TA:) or i. q.<br>\
عَصِيرٌ [i. e. expressed juice]. (TA, from an explanation of a trad.)<br>\
-A2-  طَابَةُ: see what next<br>\
follows.<br>\
طَيْبَةُ a name of The city of the Prophet; (S,<br>\
O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ طَابَةُ, (O, Msb, K,) and<br>\

طِيبَةٌ an inf. n. of طَابَ. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
The clearest of wine: (K:) and the choicest of<br>\
herbage. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  طِيبَةُ is a name of The well<br>\
Zemzem. (O, K.)<br>\
سَبْىٌ طِيَبَةٌ (tropical:)  Persons (As, TA) made captive<br>\
lawfully, (As, S, * A, O, * K, * TA,) without perfidy<br>\
and breach of covenant, (S, A, O, K,) not made<br>\
so when a covenant is existing with them, (As,<br>\
TA,) nor when there is any doubt respecting their<br>\
state of slavery: (O:) طِيَبَةٌ, in the sense of طَيِّبٌ,<br>\
is [said to be] the only instance among nouns,<br>\
(TA,) or rather among epithets, (MF, TA,) of<br>\
فِعَلَةٌ, with kesr and then fet-h, (TA,) i. e. with<br>\
only fet-h to the ع. (MF, TA.)<br>\
طُوبَى, of the measure فُعْلَى from الطِّيبُ,<br>\
originally طُيْبَى, (Zj, S, O, Msb,) an inf. n. of<br>\
طَابٌ, (Ksh and Bd in xiii. 28,) syn. with طِيبٌ:<br>\
(Seer, K: [in my MS copy of the K طَيِّب, a<br>\
manifest mistake:]) and fem. of أَطْيَبُ: (ISd,<br>\
K:) and pl. of طَيِّبَةٌ, (K,) accord. to Kr, who<br>\
says that there is no word like it except كُوسَى<br>\
pl. of كَيِّسَةٌ, and ضُوقَى pl. of ضَيِّقَةٌ; but ISd<br>\
says that, in his opinion, طُوبَى and كُوسَى and<br>\
ضُوقَى are fems. of أَطْيَبُ and أَكْيَسُ and أَضْيَقُ,<br>\
because فُعْلَى is not a pl. measure: Kr also adds<br>\
that they did not say ↓ طِيبَى, like as they said<br>\
كِيسَى and ضِيقَى; (TA; [see ضُوقَى, in art.<br>\
ضيق;]) [but Sgh says that] ↓ طِيبَى is a dial. var.<br>\
of طُوبَى: (O:) Aboo-Hátim Sahl Ibn-Mohammad Es-Sijistánee relates that an Arab of the<br>\
desert, reciting as a pupil to him, persisted in<br>\
pronouncing طُيْبَى for طُوبَى: (TA:) it signifies<br>\
حُسْنَى [as meaning A good final, or ultimate,<br>\
state or condition]: and (some say, O, Msb) خَيْرٌ<br>\
[meaning good, good fortune, and the like]: (O,<br>\
Msb, K:) and خِيرَةٌ [meaning God&#39;s blessing or<br>\
favour, &amp;c.]; (K;) as some say: (TA:) or<br>\
eternal life: (Zj, TA:) or a pleasant life: (Msb:)<br>\
and (O, K) a certain tree in Paradise; (S, O,<br>\
K;) thus the Prophet is related to have said;<br>\
and MF says that it is a proper name thereof,<br>\
not admitting the article ال, and the like is said<br>\
in the M: (TA:) or it signifies Paradise in the<br>\
Indian language; (O, K;) or, accord. to Sa&#39;eed<br>\
Ibn-Jubeyr, in the Abyssinian language: (O:)<br>\
as also ↓ طِيبَى. (K.) These different significations are assigned by different persons to this<br>\
word in the phrase in the Kur [xiii. 28] طُوبَى لَهُمْ<br>\
[which seems to be best rendered as an announcement, meaning A good final state, &amp;c., shall be<br>\
to them, or be their lot]: (Msb, TA:) Sb holds<br>\
that it is an invocation of good, or a prayer, [as<br>\
though قُلْ i. e. “ say thou ” were understood<br>\
before it,] and that طوبى is virtually in the nom.<br>\
case, i. e. مَرْفُوع, as is shown by the words immediately following وَحُسْنُ مَآبٍ: but Th, who<br>\
makes طوبى to be an inf. n. like رُجْعَى, says<br>\
that one reading is طُوبَى لَهُمْ وَحُسْنَ مَآبٍ, like<br>\
the phrase سَقْيًا لَهُ: MF, however, [supposing<br>\
Th to have said طُوبًى, though I think it indubitable that he said طُوبَى, and only meant<br>\
that it was used as virtually, not literally, with<br>\
tenween,] observes that رُجْعًى, with tenween, is<br>\
not known to have been transmitted from any one<br>\
of the leading authorities on the Arabic language.<br>\
(TA.) Katádeh says that طُوبَى لَهُمْ is a phrase<br>\
of the Arabs; who say, طُوبَى لَكَ إِنْ فَعَلْتَ كَذَا<br>\
وَكَذَا [A good final state &amp;c., be to thee, or be<br>\
thy lot, or shall be to thee, if thou do such and<br>\
such things]: and it is said in a trad., طُوبَى لِلشَّأْمِ<br>\
[May good, &amp;c., betide Syria]; in which case,<br>\
طوبى is of the measure فُعْلَى from الطِّيبُ, and<br>\
does not mean “ Paradise,” nor “ the tree. ” (L,<br>\
TA.) One says, طُوبَى لَكَ and طُوبَاكَ; (S, K;)<br>\
but not طُوَبيْكَ: (Yaakoob, S, O: [in one of my<br>\
copies of the S طُوبِيكَ:]) or طُوبَاكَ is a barbarism:<br>\
(O, K:) it is disallowed by the T, and by most<br>\
of the grammarians: but Akh says that it is used<br>\
by some of the Arabs; and Ibn-El-Moatezz uses<br>\
it in the following verse:<br>\
مَرَّتْ بِنَا سَحَرًا طَيْرٌ فَقُلْتُ لَهَا<br>\
طُوبَاكِ يَا لَيْتَنَا إِيَّاكِ طُوبَاكِ<br>\
[A flock of birds passed by us a little before daybreak, and I said to them, Good betide you:<br>\
would that we were you: good betide you]: Esh-<br>\
Shiháb El-Khafájee says that ل is understood<br>\
[before the ك] in طوباك; but MF has argued<br>\
well against this assertion. (TA.)<br>\
طِيبَى: see the next preceding paragraph,<br>\
former half, in three places.<br>\
طِيَابٌ A sort of palm-trees of El-Basrah, (L,<br>\
K, TA,) the dates of which, when the gathering<br>\
has been delayed beyond the usual time, fall, one<br>\
after another, from their stones, so that the raceme<br>\
remains with nothing upon it but the stones hanging to the bases of the dates; though they are<br>\
large; and if the fruit is gathered when fully<br>\
ripe, the stone does not come off with it. (L, TA.)<br>\
طَيِّبٌ (S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and ↓ طَابٌ,<br>\
(S, M, O, K,) the latter originally طَائِبٌ and<br>\

measure فَعَلٌ, (M, TA,) Contr. of خَبِيثٌ, (S,<br>\
Mgh, O,) in two senses: (Mgh:) [i. e. good,]<br>\
pleasant, delightful, delicious, sweet, or savoury;<br>\
syn. لَذِيذٌ; (Msb, K; *) or esteemed [good,]<br>\
pleasant, delightful, delicious, sweet, or savoury,<br>\

(TA.) And فُلَانٌ فِى بَيْتٍ طَيِّبٍ i. e. (tropical:)  [Such a<br>\

الْخَبِيثُ وَالطَّيِّبُ, in the Kur [v. 100], means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The unlawful and the lawful of property and<br>\

مُطَيَّبٌ pass. part. n. of 2. (TA.) Hence,<br>\
(TA,) حِلْفُ المُطَيَّبِينَ [The covenant of the perfumed men]: (K, TA:) these were five tribes;<br>\
Benoo-&#39;Abd-Menáf and Benoo-Asad-Ibn-&#39;AbdEl-&#39;Ozzà and Benoo-Teym and Benoo-Zuhrah<br>\
and Benu-l-Hárith and Benoo-Fihr: (TA:) and<br>\
they were so called for the following reason:<br>\
when Benoo-&#39;Abd-Menáf desired to assume [the<br>\
offices of] the حِجَابَة and the رِفَادَة and the لِوَآء<br>\
and the سِقَايَة, [see arts. حجب &amp;c.,] which belonged to Benoo-&#39;Abd-ed-Dár, and these refused<br>\
their consent, all of the above-mentioned, (K,<br>\
TA,) having assembled in the house of Ibn-Jud&#39;án, in the Time of Ignorance, (TA,) concluded a ratified covenant for the accomplishment of their affair, engaging not to fail in aiding<br>\
one another: then they mixed some perfumes,<br>\
and dipped their hands therein; after which they<br>\
wiped their hands upon the Kaabeh in token of<br>\
confirmation of the covenant: and Benoo-&#39;Abded-Dár, also, and their confederates, (K, TA,)<br>\
composing six tribes, Benoo-&#39;Abd-ed-Dár and<br>\
Jumah and Makhzoom and &#39;Adee and Kaab<br>\
and Sahm, (TA,) concluded together another<br>\
covenant, and were thence called الأَحْلَاف: (K,<br>\
TA:) this is the account commonly known and<br>\
received: another account is the following: there<br>\
came a man of the Benoo-Zeyd to Mekkeh for<br>\
the purpose of [the religious visit termed] the<br>\
عُمْرَة, having with him merchandise, and a man<br>\
of Sahm bought this of him, and refused to pay<br>\
him for it; whereupon he called to them from<br>\
the summit of Aboo-Kubeys, and they arose, and<br>\
entered into a covenant together to do him<br>\
justice: thus relates Eth-Tha&#39;álibee: (TA:)<br>\
Mohammad was one of the مُطَيَّبُون, (K, TA,)<br>\
being then twenty-five years old; and so was<br>\
Aboo-Bekr: and &#39;Omar was an أَحْلَفِىّ. (TA.)<br>\
