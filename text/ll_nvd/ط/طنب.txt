طُنُبٌ (S, A, O, L, Msb, K) and ↓ طُنْبٌ (L,<br>\
TA) A tent-rope: (Ham p. 687:) a rope with<br>\
which the خَيْمَة and the like are tied, or made<br>\
fast: (Msb:) a rope of the خِبَآء (S, O, L, TA)<br>\
and of the سُرَادِق [q. v.] and the like: (L, TA:)<br>\
a long rope with which the سرادق of the tent is<br>\
tied, or made fast; (A, K, TA;) or, as in the<br>\
M, with which the tent and the سرادق are tied,<br>\
or made fast, [extending] between the ground and<br>\
the طَرَائِق [pl. of طَرِيقَةٌ, q. v.]: (TA:) and also<br>\
a وَتِد [app. meaning a tent-peg]; thus in the K,<br>\
and the like is said in the M; those who make<br>\
الوَتِدُ in the K to be conjoined with سرادق [as<br>\
though the author meant that طنب signifies a<br>\
long rope with which the سرادق of the tent, and<br>\
the peg, are tied, or made fast,] being in error:<br>\
(TA: [but in my opinion, this reading which is<br>\
disallowed in the TA is more probably correct<br>\
than the other: in the CK, and in my MS. copy<br>\
of the K, instead of وَالوَتِدُ, we find او الوتد: in a<br>\
copy of the A, او الوَتِرُ, an obvious mistranscription:]) the pl. is أَطْنَابٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
طِنَبَةٌ; (K;) and some of the lexicologists assert<br>\
that طُنُبٌ is used as a sing. like عُنُقٌ, and as a<br>\
pl. like كُتُبٌ; (MF, TA;) and Ibn-es-Sarráj<br>\
says, in one place of his book, that it has no<br>\
other pl. than أَطْنَابٌ; but in another place he<br>\
says that it has this pl. accord. to those who give<br>\
it a pl., thus giving to understand that there is a<br>\
difference of opinion as to the plural&#39;s being<br>\
allowable, and that it is used in one form as<br>\
sing. and pl., which is the case: (Msb, TA:)<br>\
the أَطْنَاب are the أَوَاخِىّ [pl. of آخِيَّةٌ], i. e. the<br>\
long ropes of the أَخْبِيَة [pl. of خِبَآء]; the short<br>\
ropes being called أُصُرٌ, sing. إِصَارٌ: the former are<br>\
the ropes with which the tent is tied, or made fast,<br>\
between the ground and the طَرَائِق. (TA.) As<br>\
an instance of a tropical usage, (A, TA,) it is<br>\
related that when El-Ash&#39;ath contracted marriage<br>\
with a woman, (A, Nh, O, Msb, L,) namely,<br>\
Meleekeh Bint-Zurárah, (Nh, Msb, L,) on the<br>\
terms upon which she should decide, (A, Nh, O,<br>\

dirhems, (A, Nh, Msb, L,) رَدَّهَا عُمَرُ إِلَى أَطْنَابِ<br>\
بَيْتِهَا, meaning (tropical:)  &#39; Omar reduced her to the dowry<br>\
of the like of her among the women of her family;<br>\
(A, Nh, O, Msb, L;) [lit., to the ropes of her<br>\
tent, or to the tent-ropes of her family;] i. e., to<br>\
the ground whereon was built the condition of<br>\
her family, and over which their tent-ropes extended. (Nh, L.) And another tropical usage<br>\
occurs in the saying, مَا بَيْنَ طُنُبَىِ المَدِينَةِ أَحْوَجُ<br>\
مِنِّى إِلَيْهَا, (TA,) a saying ascribed to the Prophet,<br>\
(O,) meaning (tropical:)  What is between the two extremities, (O, TA,) and the two sides, (TA,) of the<br>\
