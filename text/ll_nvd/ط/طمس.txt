You say, طَمَسَتْهُ الرِّيحُ The wind effaced, or<br>\

given to Moses, when the property of Pharaoh<br>\
was transformed at his prayer, and became stones.<br>\
(M.) [See the Kur xvii. 103, and xxvii. 12.]<br>\

alter, faces: (S:) or these words, with what<br>\
immediately follows, فَنَرُدَّهَا عَلَى أَدْبَارِهَا, are expl.<br>\
in three different ways: before we make faces to<br>\
be like the backs of necks: or before we make<br>\
faces to be places in which hair shall grow like<br>\
the backs of necks: or (tropical:)  before we make them to<br>\
err, in requital of their opposition. (Zj, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  طَمْسٌ also signifies i. q. فَسَادٌ [as though in<br>\
