طَاعَ لَهُ, (T, S, O, Msb, K,) and طَاعَهُ, (Msb,)<br>\
first pers. طُعْتُ, (Zj, O, Msb, *) aor. يَطُوعُ, (T, S,<br>\
O, Msb, K,) inf. n. طَوْعٌ; (T, Msb, TA;) and,<br>\
first pers. طِعْتُ, (Zj, O, Msb, *) aor. يَطَاعُ, (T,<br>\
O, Msb, K,) a good dial. var., (T, TA,) and<br>\
يَطِيعُ, (Msb, and K in art. طيع,) inf. n. طَيْعٌ;<br>\
(TA in art. طيع;) three dial. vars., coordinate to<br>\
قَالَ and خَافَ and بَاعَ; (Msb;) He was, or became, submissive to him; (S, O, Msb, K;) as<br>\
also له ↓ انطاع; (AO, S, O, Msb;) and ↓ اطاعهُ,<br>\
inf. n. إِطَاعَةٌ, and subst. [i. e. quasi-inf. n.]<br>\
↓ طَاعَةٌ: (Msb:) or i. q. ↓ اطاع; (T, TA;) which<br>\
is expl. by ISd as meaning he was, or became,<br>\
gentle, and submissive; as also طَاعَ, aor. يَطَاعُ:<br>\
(TA:) [or each of these two verbs may be rendered he was, or became, obedient; or he obeyed;<br>\
when by this is meant compliance with another&#39;s<br>\
will or wish, not with a command: but] one says,<br>\
↓ أَمَرَهُ فَأطَاعَهُ [He commanded him and he obeyed<br>\
him], with ا, not otherwise; (S;) or أَمَرَهُ قَأَطَاعَ<br>\
[he commanded him and he obeyed]; for it is said<br>\
that ↓ الطَّاعَةُ is never otherwise than a consequence<br>\
of a command; and IF says that when one goes<br>\
by command of another you say of him اطاعهُ:<br>\
(Msb:) Er-Rághib says that ↓ الطَّاعَةُ is like<br>\
الطَّوْعُ; but is mostly used as meaning obedience<br>\
to a command [or the like; whence the saying,<br>\
اَللَّهُمَّ لَا تُطِيعَنَّ لِى شَامِتًا, expl. in art. شمت]:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ طاوعهُ, also, signifies he obeyed<br>\
him; like ↓ اطاعهُ: you say, عَلَى أَمْرِ ↓ طاوعهُ<br>\
كَذَا he obeyed him in respect of such an affair.<br>\
(MA. [But see 3 below.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] لِسَانُهُ لَا<br>\
يَطُوعُ بِكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  His tongue will not aid, or assist,<br>\
him with such a thing. (S, O.) See also 2.<br>\
[And see 3.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And sometimes (S) one says,<br>\
طَاعَ لَهُ المَرْتَعُ, (S, O, K,) like له ↓ اطاع, (ISk,<br>\
S, O,) or like اطاعهُ, (K,) meaning (tropical:)  The pasturage enabled him to pasture his cattle upon it<br>\
(S, O, K, * TA) wheresoever he would, (TA,) and<br>\
was ample to him; (O, TA;) and it was not inaccessible to him. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
تَطْوِيعٌ [primarily] signifies The making<br>\
obedient; or the causing to obey. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
فَطَوَّعَتْ لَهُ نَفْسُهُ قَتْلَ أَخِيهِ, (S, O, Msb, * K, *) in<br>\
the Kur [v. 33], means (tropical:)  And his soul, or mind,<br>\
facilitated to him [the slaying of his brother];<br>\
(Akh, S, O, Msb, TA;) like طَوَّقَتْهُ; (Akh, S,<br>\
O, TA;) and like ↓ طَاوَعَتْهُ, [which is one of<br>\
the explanations in the O and K, and] which<br>\
means the same; (Msb;) and accord. to this<br>\
explanation it is tropical: Mbr says that it is<br>\
an instance of فَعَّلَتْ from الطَّوْعُ; and ↓ طَاعَتْ<br>\
and طَوَّعَتْ are said to signify alike: (TA:) or<br>\
the meaning is, aided him, or assisted him; (Fr,<br>\
O, K;) accord. to which explanation, and that<br>\
of Mbr, فِى is said by Az to be suppressed; the<br>\
meaning being, فِى قَتْلِ أَخِيهِ; or لِقَتْلِ أَخِيهِ; and<br>\
he prefers the explanation of Akh: (TA:) or the<br>\
meaning is, (O, K,) accord. to Mujáhid, (O,)<br>\
encouraged him, and (O, K) A &#39;Obeyd says that<br>\
by this Mujáhid meant (TA) aided him, and<br>\
complied with his wish. (O, K, TA,)<br>\
3<br>\
طاوعهُ, (IF, Msb, K, TA,) inf. n. مُطَاوَعَةٌ,<br>\
(S, O, TA,) and quasi-inf. n. طَوَاعِيَةٌ, (TA,) i. q.<br>\
وَافَقَهُ [as meaning He complied with him]. (IF,<br>\
S, * O, * Msb, K, * TA.) You say, طاوعت المَرْأَةُ<br>\
زَوْجَهَا, quasi-inf. n. طَوَاعِيَةٌ, The woman complied<br>\
with her husband. (TA.) It is said that طاوعهُ<br>\
differs from أَطَاعَهُ. (Msb, TA.) But see 1, latter<br>\
half, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 2. ―<br>\
-b3-  One says<br>\
also, طاوع لَهُ المُرَادُ (tropical:)  The thing wished, or desired,<br>\
or sought after, [was, or became, easy of attainment to him; or] came to him easily. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اطاع, inf. n. إِطَاعَةٌ, and quasi-inf. n. طَاعَةٌ:<br>\
see 1, in four places. It also signifies He consented; or complied with what was desired of<br>\
him; and so ↓ استطاع. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
اطاع لَهُ المَرْتَعُ: see 1, last sentence. One says<br>\
also, اطاع النَّخْلُ, (S, O,) and الشَّجَرُ, (S, O, K,)<br>\
(tropical:)  The palm-trees, (S, O, TA,) and the trees, (S,<br>\
O, K, TA,) had ripe fruit, that might be gathered.<br>\
(S, O, K, TA.) And اطاع التَّمْرُ (assumed tropical:)  The dates<br>\
attained, or were near, to the time, or season, for<br>\
their being cut off. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تطوّع لِلشَّىْءِ and<br>\
تطوّعهُ He desired the thing;<br>\
or sought it; or sought it by artful, or skilful,<br>\
management: or he constrained himself to do it:<br>\
or he took it, or imposed it, upon himself submissively. (TA.) You say, تَطَوَّعْ لِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ حَتَّى<br>\
تَسْتَطِيعَهُ, (S,) and ↓ تَطَاوَعْ, (S, K, *) Constrain<br>\
thyself to acquire ability to perform this affair<br>\
until thou shalt be able to perform it. (S.) And<br>\
تطوّع بِالشَّىْءِ He did the thing without its being<br>\
incumbent, or obligatory, on him; syn. تَبَرَّعَ بِهِ.<br>\
(S, O, * Msb.) مَنْ تَطَوَّعَ خَيْرًا, in the Kur ii. 153<br>\
[and 180], means Whoso does good that is not<br>\
obligatory on him: (Jel:) or does good in obedience,<br>\
whether obligatory or supererogatory: or does<br>\
good beyond what is obligatory on him: (Bd:)<br>\
خَيْرًا being for بِخَيْرٍ: (Bd, * Jel:) or it is an<br>\
epithet qualifying an inf. n. suppressed: or the<br>\
verb is made trans. as implying the meaning of<br>\
أَتَى or فَعَلَى: (Bd:) and the Koofees, except<br>\
&#39;Ásim, read يَطَّوَّعْ, for يَتَطَوَّعْ. (Az, * O, TA. *)<br>\
[Hence,] طَلَاةُ التَّطَوُّعِ The supererogatory prayer;<br>\
syn. النَّافِلَةُ. (O, K.) And Az says that تَطَوُّعٌ signifies A thing that one does spontaneously, not<br>\
made obligatory on him by an ordinance of God;<br>\
as though it were made a subst. (TA.)<br>\

إِنْطَوَعَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
10<br>\
استطاع, (S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. اِسْتِطَاعَةٌ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb,) originally اِسْتِطْوَاعٌ, (O, B, TA,)<br>\
i. q. أَطَاقَ [meaning He was able; and he was<br>\
able to do, or accomplish, a thing, and to acquire<br>\
or obtain it, and to have it, &amp;c.]; (K, TA; [in<br>\
the CK, erroneously, أَطَاعَ, which, however, correctly explains one meaning of استطاع, as will be<br>\
seen by what follows;]) the inf. n. being syn. with<br>\
إِطَاقَةٌ, (S, O, TA,) or طَاقَةٌ, (Msb,) and قُدْرَةٌ:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) but it is said peculiarly of a human<br>\
being [or a rational creature], whereas اطاق is<br>\
used in a general manner: (IB, TA:) and the<br>\
application of the former requires a peculiar constitution of the agent, and the conception of the<br>\
act, and the fitness of the object to be acted upon<br>\
or effected, and the possession of an instrument<br>\
when the action is instrumental as in the case of<br>\
writing: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and one says also,<br>\
(K,) or sometimes they said, (S, O, Msb,) اِسْطَاعَ<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K,) aor. يَسْطِيعُ, (S, O, Msb,) with<br>\
fet-h [to the first letter]; (Msb;) rejecting the<br>\
ت, deeming it difficult of utterance with the ط,<br>\
and disliking to incorporate it into the ط because<br>\
the س would then become movent, which it never<br>\
is: Hamzeh (i. e. Ez-Zeiyát, TA, not Khallád,<br>\
O, K, TA) read, [in the Kur xviii. 96,] فَمَا<br>\
اسْطَّاعُوا, with idghám, combining two quiescent<br>\
letters: (S, O, K:) this reading is said by Zj,<br>\
as on the authority of Kh and Yoo and Sb and<br>\
others, to be incorrect; but Abu-l-&#39;Abbás Ahmad<br>\
Ibn Mohammad Ibn-&#39;Abd-El-Ghanee Ed-Dimyátee, who died in the year [of the Flight] 1116,<br>\
and Ibn-El-Jezeree, and El-Háfidh Aboo-&#39;Amr,<br>\
contradict him, affirming it to be allowable:<br>\
(TA:) and Akh says, (S, O,) and some of the<br>\
Arabs say اِسْتَاعَ, aor. يَسْتِيعُ, (S, O, K,) rejecting<br>\
the ط; (S, O;) which Zj holds to be not allowable in reading [the Kur-án]: (TA:) and some<br>\
of the Arabs say أَسْطَاعَ, aor. يُسْطِيعُ, [in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, يَسْطِيعُ,] with the disjunctive ا [in<br>\
the former], meaning أَطَاعَ, aor. يُطِيعُ, (Akh,<br>\
S, O, K,) making the س to be a substitute for<br>\
the suppressed vowel of the medial radical letter<br>\
of the verb [اطاع], (Akh, S, O,) for, as is said<br>\
by Kh and Sb, أَطَاعَ is originally أَطْوَعَ; (TA;)<br>\
or, as AZ says, the verb in this case, with damm<br>\
to the aor., is likened to أَفْعَلَ, aor. يُفْعِلُ, inf. n.<br>\
إِفْعَالٌ: (Msb:) but Zj says that he who reads<br>\
فَمَا اسَطَّاعُوا errs; for the س of اِسْتَفْعَلَ is never<br>\
movent: and Sb mentions مَا أَسْتَتِيعُ; holding it<br>\
to be an instance of substitution. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also 4. Some say that هَلْ يَسْتَطِيعُ رَبُّكَ أَنْ يُنَزِّلَ<br>\
عَلَيْنَا مَائِدَةً مِنَ السَّمَآءِ, in the Kur [v. 112], means<br>\
هَلْ يُجِيبُ [i. e. Will thy Lord consent, or comply<br>\
with the desire, that He should send down to us a<br>\
table with food upon it from Heaven?]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) ―<br>\
-b3-  and Ks read هَلْ تَسْتَطِيعُ رَبَّكَ,<br>\
meaning Wilt thou demand of thy Lord that He<br>\
consent, or comply with the desire? (O, TA:) for<br>\
استطاعهُ signifies also He demanded his obedience,<br>\
and his consent, or compliance with what he desired of him. (TA.)<br>\
طَاعٌ accord. to the copies of the O and K; but<br>\
some say طَاعٍ accord. to the O: see طَائِعٌ, in three<br>\
places.<br>\
طَوْعٌ: see طَائِعٌ, in seven places.<br>\
طَاعَةٌ [quasi-inf. n. of 4: as a simple subst.,<br>\
sometimes meaning Submission, or submissiveness:<br>\
but mostly, obedience to a command]: see 1, in<br>\
three places; and see also طَوَاعِيَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  [See also<br>\
طَائِعٌ, of which it is a pl.]<br>\
طَوَاعَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
طَوَاعِيَةٌ i. q. ↓ طَاعَةٌ: (S, O, K:) so in the say-<br>\
ing فُلَانٌ حَسَنُ الطَّوَاعِيَةِ لَكَ [Such a one is good<br>\
in obedience to thee]: (S, O, TA:) or it is a subst.<br>\
from 3 [q. v.]; and so ↓ طوَاعَة [app. طَوَاعَةٌ].<br>\
(L, TA.)<br>\
طَائِعٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ طَاعٌ, (O, K,) and<br>\
some say ↓ طَاعٍ, formed from طَائِعٌ by transposition, (O,) and ↓ طَيِّعٌ, signify the same, (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) i. e. Being, or becoming, submissive;<br>\
[or, simply, submissive; and obeying; or obedient;]<br>\
(Msb;) and ↓ طَوْعٌ, originally an inf. n., is likewise used as syn. with طَائِعٌ: (Ham p. 408:) the<br>\
pl. is طُوَّعٌ, (S, O, K,) i. e. pl. of طَائِعٌ, (S, O,)<br>\
and طَاعَةٌ is [also a pl. of طَائِعٌ, like as بَاعَةٌ is of<br>\
بَائِعٌ; or] syn. with مُطِيعُونَ: (TA in art. سوع:)<br>\
[whence one says, دَخَلَ فِى طَاعَتِهِ, and خَرَجَ مِنْ<br>\
طَاعَتِهِ, He entered among, and he quitted, his<br>\
obeyers, or those who obeyed him; i. e. he became<br>\
obedient, and he became disobedient, to him:] and<br>\
↓ مِطْوَاعٌ, (S, O, K,) pl. مَطَاوِيعُ, (TA,) is [app.,<br>\
agreeably with analogy, an intensive epithet,<br>\
meaning very submissive or obedient, but is said<br>\
to be, in like manner,] syn. with مُطِيعٌ, (S, O, K,)<br>\
applied to a man: (S, O:) and ↓ مِطْوَاعَةٌ, applied<br>\
to a man, [is app. a doubly intensive epithet; or]<br>\
is syn. with مِطْوَاعٌ: (TA:) and is applied to a<br>\
pl. number, as meaning compliant and submissive.<br>\
(Har p. 237.) One says, جَآءَ فُلَانٌ طَائِعًا Such a<br>\
one came [submissively, or obediently, or willingly,]<br>\
not being compelled against his will. (S, O.) And<br>\
a poet says,<br>\
حَلَفْتُ بِالبَيْتِ وَمَا حَوْلَهُ<br>\
↓ مِنْ عَائِذٍ بِالبَيْتِ أَوْطَاعِ<br>\
[I swore, or have sworn, by the House of God<br>\
(i. e. the Kaabeh), and what are around it, of<br>\
such as betakes himself for refuge to the House<br>\
or of such as renders obedience by visiting it].<br>\
(O.) And one says also, ↓ جَآءَ طَيِّعًا [He came<br>\
of his own accord, or willingly]. (M and TA<br>\
voce ذُو.) And اللِّسَانِ ↓ طَيِّعُ (tropical:)  A man chaste, or<br>\
eloquent, in speech. (TA.) And القِيَادِ ↓ نَاقَةٌ طَيِّعَةُ<br>\

tractable;] that does not contend with her leader.<br>\
(TA.) And العِنَانِ ↓ فَرَسٌ طَوْعُ (tropical:)  A traciable<br>\
horse. (S, O, K, TA.) And يَدِكَ ↓ فُلَانٌ طَوْعُ<br>\
(tropical:)  Such a one is submissive to thy hand. (S, O,<br>\
K, TA.) And الضَّجِيعِ ↓ اِمْرَأَةٌ طَوْعُ A woman<br>\
submissive to the bedfellow. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ<br>\
المَكَارِهِ ↓ طَوْعُ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is submissive to misfortunes, [being] subject thereto. (T, TA.) [See<br>\
also an ex. of ↓ طَوْع in a verse cited in art. شمت<br>\
voce شَامِتَةٌ.] السِّنَانِ ↓ هُوَ أَطْوَعُ means (assumed tropical:)  He is one<br>\
to whom the spear-head is subservient, howsoever<br>\
he will. (K in art. سن.)<br>\
طَيِّعٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in four<br>\
places.<br>\
أَطْوَعُ [as signifying More, and most, submissive<br>\
or obedient is regularly formed from طَاعَ; or] is<br>\
from الطَّاعَةُ [i. e. from أَطَاعَ], and similar to أَجْوَبُ<br>\
[from أَجَابَ, and therefore anomalous]. (M and<br>\
L in art. جوب.) أَطْوَعُ مِنْ فَرَسٍ, and مِنْ كَلْبٍ,<br>\
[More submissive, or obedient, that a horse, and<br>\
than a dog,] are provs. (Meyd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [It app.<br>\
signifies also Very submissive or obedient: see an<br>\
ex. in a verse cited voce تَبَدَّعَ. ―<br>\
-b3-  And it is also<br>\
a simple epithet, like أَهْوَنُ &amp;c.:] see طَائِعٌ, last<br>\
sentence.<br>\
شُحٌّ مُطَاعٌ means A niggardliness that is obeyed<br>\
by him who is characterized thereby, by the refusing<br>\
rights, or dues, (O, K,) which God has rendered<br>\
obligatory on him, in respect of his property:<br>\
occurring in a trad. of the Prophet. (O.) And<br>\
المُطَاعُ, as a name of the Prophet, means He<br>\
whose prayer is answered; whose intercession for<br>\
his people is accepted. (TA.)<br>\
مِطْوَاعٌ: see طَائِعٌ, first sentence.<br>\
مِطْوَاعَةٌ [an epithet of a very rare form, like<br>\
مِعْزَابَةٌ, q. v.]: see طَائِعٌ.<br>\
مُطَاوِعٌ an epithet applied by the grammarians<br>\
to (tropical:)  A verb that is intransitive [such as I term<br>\
quasi-passive; expl. as meaning a verb whose<br>\
(grammatical) agent receives the effect of the<br>\
action of the agent of another verb (فِعْلٌ يَقْبَلُ<br>\

who exceed what is obligatory on them in fighting,<br>\
or warring, against unbelievers or the like; (S,<br>\
O, Msb;) originally المُتَطَوِّعَةُ: (Msb:) hence<br>\
↓ المُطَّوِّعِينَ in the Kur ix. 80; originally<br>\
المُتَطَوِّعِينَ. (S, O.)<br>\
