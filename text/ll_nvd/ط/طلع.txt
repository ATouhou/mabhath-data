طَلَعَتِ الشَّمْسُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
طَلُعَ [notwithstanding the faucial letter], (Msb, JM, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. طُلُوعٌ and مَطْلَعٌ and مَطْلِعٌ, (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) the second and third both used as inf. ns.,<br>\
and also as ns. of place [and of time], (S, O, K,)<br>\
but the former of them is preferable on the ground<br>\
of analogy as an inf. n., and the latter as a n. of<br>\
place (Fr, O) or of time, (Zj, O,) The sun rose,<br>\
(MA,) or appeared; (K;) and in like manner<br>\
طَلَعَ is said of the moon, (TA,) and of a star, or<br>\
an asterism; (S, O, K;) and so ↓ اِطَّلَعَ; (K;)<br>\
[and ↓ أَطْلَعَ, for] أَطْلَعَتِ الثُّرَيَّا means طَلَعَت [i. e.<br>\
The Pleiades rose], as in a verse of El-Kumeyt<br>\
[in which, however, the verb may, consistently<br>\
with the metre, be a mistranscription for اطَّلَعَت];<br>\
(IB, TA); and أَطْلَعَ is syn. with طَلَعَ in the<br>\
saying of Ru-beh,<br>\
كَأَنَّهُ كَوْكَبُ غَيْمٍ أَطْلَعَا<br>\
[As though it, or he, were a star in the midst of<br>\
clouds, that had risen]. (TA.) One says also,<br>\
آتِيكَ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ طَلَعَتْهُ الشَّمْسُ, meaning طَلَعَتْ فِيهِ<br>\
[i. e. I will come to thee every day in which the<br>\
sun rises]: and it is said in a prayer, طَلَعَتِ<br>\
الشَّمْسُ وَلَا تَطْلُعُ بِنَفْسِ أَحَدٍ مِنَّا [meaning The<br>\
sun has risen, and may it not have risen with the<br>\
soul of any one of us]; i. e., may not any one of us<br>\
have died with its rising: the future being put<br>\
in the place of the preterite. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And طَلَعَ<br>\
is said of anything that appears to one from the<br>\
upper part [of a thing, or that comes up out of a<br>\
thing and appears]. (Mgh, Msb.) It is said in<br>\
the Ksh that الطُّلُوعُ signifies The appearing by<br>\
rising, or by becoming elevated. (TA.) One<br>\
says, طَلَعَتْ سِنُّ الصَّبِىِّ (tropical:)  The tooth of the child<br>\
showed its point. (K, TA.) And طَلَعَ الزَّرْعُ,<br>\
[aor.<br>\
طَلُعَ,] inf. n. طُلُوعٌ, (tropical:)  The seed-produce began<br>\
to come up, and showed its sprouting forth: (T,<br>\
TA:) and الزَّرْعُ ↓ أَطْلَعَ (tropical:)  The seed-produce appeared: (TA:) and نَبْتُ الأَرْضِ ↓ أَطْلَعَ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
plants, or herbage, of the earth, or land, came<br>\
forth: (Mgh:) and الشَّجَرُ ↓ أَطْلَعَ (tropical:)  The trees<br>\
put forth their leaves. (TA.) And طَلَعَ النَّخْلُ,<br>\
(O, K,) aor.<br>\
طَلُعَ, inf. n. طُلُوعٌ; (TA;) and (O, K)<br>\
↓ أَطْلَعَ; (Zj, S, Mgh, O, K;) or أَطْلَعَتِ النَّخْلَةُ;<br>\
(Msb;) (assumed tropical:)  The palm-trees, or -tree, put forth the طَلْع<br>\
[q. v.]; (Zj, S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ طلّع, (L, K, TA,) inf. n. تَطْلِيعٌ. (L, TA.<br>\
[These verbs, in this sense, are app. derived from<br>\
the subst. طَلْعٌ; but this is obviously from طَلَعَ.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  One says also, مَلَأْتُ لَهُ القَدَحَ حَتَّى يَكَادَ يَطْلُعُ<br>\
مِنْ نَوَاحِيهِ [I filled for him the drinking-vessel<br>\
until it nearly overflowed from its sides]. (TA.)<br>\
And المَآءُ فِى الإِنَآءِ ↓ تَطَلَّعَ (assumed tropical:)  The water in the<br>\
vessel poured forth [or overflowed] from its sides.<br>\

طَلُعَ, (TA,) inf. n. طُلُوعٌ, (Msb, TA,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
ascended upon the mountain; (Mgh, Msb, K,<br>\
TA;) the prep. [عَلَى] being suppressed;<br>\
(Mgh;) as also طَلِعَ, with kesr; (K;) and<br>\
الجَبَلَ ↓ اِطَّلَعَ signifies the same as طَلَعَهُ: (TA:<br>\
[see also مُضْطَلِعٌ, in art. ضلع:]) accord. to ISk,<br>\
one says, طَلِعْتُ الجَبَلَ, with kesr, meaning (assumed tropical:)  I<br>\
ascended upon the mountain; (S, O;) but others<br>\
say, طَلَعْتُ, with fet-h. (O.) And (tropical:)  He ascended the mountain: (TA:) [or] طَلَعْتُ فِى<br>\
الجَبَلِ means (assumed tropical:)  I ascended the mountain. (Msb.<br>\
[See also another explanation of this latter phrase<br>\
in what follows.]) ―<br>\

or party: and he looked upon them: (MA:)<br>\

to the people, or party: and طَلَعْتُ عَنْهُمْ I became absent, or absented myself, or departed, from<br>\
them: (S, O:) and عَلَيْهِمْ ↓ أَطْلَعْتُ signifies the<br>\
same as طَلَعْتُ: (O:) and طَلَعْتُ عَنْهُمْ has the<br>\
same meaning [also] as طَلَعْتُ عَنْهُمْ expl. above,<br>\
accord. to ISk; عَلَى being put in the place of<br>\
عن: accord. to AZ [likewise], طَلَعْتُ عَلَى القَوْمِ,<br>\
inf. n. طُلُوعٌ, means I became absent from the<br>\
people, or party, so that they did not see me: and<br>\
also I advanced, or approached, towards them,<br>\
so that they saw me: thus having two contr.<br>\
meanings: and accord. to Az, the Arabs said,<br>\
طَلَعْتُ فِى الجَبَلِ, inf. n. طُلُوعٌ, as meaning I<br>\
retired, or went back, into the mountain, so that<br>\
my companion did not see me: [see another<br>\
explanation of this phrase in what precedes:]<br>\
and طَلَعْتُ عَنْ صَاحِبِى, inf. n. طُلُوعٌ, I retired,<br>\
or went back, from my companion: and طَلَعْتُ<br>\
عَنْ صَاحِبِى [in which عَنْ seems to be evidently<br>\
a mistranscription for عَلَى] I advanced, or approached, towards my companion. (TA.) [In<br>\
all of these phrases, طَلَعَ and طَلَعْتُ may be correctly rendered He, and I, came forth, or<br>\
went forth. And hence,] it is said in a prov.,<br>\
هٰذِهِ يَمِينٌ قَدْ طَلَعَتْ فِى المَخَارِمِ [expl. in art.<br>\
خرم, voce مَخْرِمٌ]. (AZ, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  For another<br>\
meaning of طَلَعَ followed by عَلَى, see اِطَّلَعَ<br>\
[which is more common as having that meaning].<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  طَلَعَ is also syn. with قَصَدَ: so in the phrase<br>\
طَلَعَ بِلَادَهُ (tropical:)  [He tended, repaired, betook himself,<br>\
or went, to, or towards, his country]: (K, TA:)<br>\
and so in the saying, in a trad., هٰذَا بُسْرٌ قَدْ طَلَعَ<br>\
اليَمَنَ, (so in the O,) or هذا بُرٌّ, (so in the TA,)<br>\
(tropical:)  [These are ripening dates, or this is wheat, that<br>\
have, or has, gone to, or towards, El-Yemen,]<br>\
meaning from Nejd. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And syn. with<br>\
بَلَغَ; as also ↓ اِطَّلَعَ: (O, K:) so the former in<br>\
the saying, طَلَعَ أَرْضَهُمْ (tropical:)  [He reached, or arrived<br>\
at, their land]; (K, TA;) and مَتَى طَلَعْتَ أَرْضَنَا<br>\
(tropical:)  [When didst thou reach, or arrive at, our<br>\
land?]: (O, TA:) and so the latter verb in the<br>\
saying, هٰذِهِ الأَرْضَ ↓ اطّلع [He reached, or<br>\
arrived at, this land]: (O, K:) and hence, (TA,)<br>\
عَلَى الأَفْئِدَةِ ↓ الَّتِى تَطَّلِعُ, in the Kur [civ. 7],<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  Whereof the pain shall reach the hearts:<br>\
(Fr, O, TA:) or which shall rise above the hearts,<br>\
(O, TA,) [or overwhelm them,] and burn them.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

-b3-  طلّع كَيْلَهُ, inf. n. as above, (assumed tropical:)  He filled his<br>\

(K,) i. q. اِطَّلَعَ عَلَيْهِ; (S, O, K;) i. e., a thing:<br>\
(S, O:) Lth says that طِلَاعٌ is syn. with اِطِّلَاعٌ;<br>\
but Az disapproves this: (O:) [the verb is correctly explained in what here follows:] one says,<br>\
طَالَعْتُ ضَيْعَتِى, meaning نَظَرْتُهَا وَاطَّلَعْتُ عَلَيْهَا (tropical:)  [I<br>\
inspected, or considered with my eye, my estate,<br>\
and obtained a knowledge of it, or acquainted<br>\
myself with its condition]: (TA:) or مُطَالَعَةٌ<br>\
signifies the inspecting a thing well, in order to<br>\
obtain a knowledge of it. (KL.) [Hence, مُطَالَعَةُ<br>\
الكُتُبِ (assumed tropical:)  The studying, and perusing, of books.]<br>\

أُطْلِعُكَ عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  [I will acquaint thee with the truth<br>\

is mentioned without explanation in the S])<br>\
[meaning (assumed tropical:)  Acquaint thou me with thy letters:<br>\

[Apparitions of Selmà come to me in the night,<br>\
like as the creditor comes in the night to exact the<br>\
debt]: but accord. to another, or others, it is<br>\
only ↓ يَتَطَلَّعُ, because تَفَاعَلَ is generally intrans.:<br>\
so that accord. to Aboo-&#39;Alee, it is like تَفَاوَضْنَا<br>\
الحَدِيثَ and تَعَاطَيْنَا الكَأْسَ and تَنَاشَدْنَا الأَشْعَارَ.<br>\
(IB, TA.)<br>\

shall look (فَاطَّلَعَ المُسْلِمُ) and see his [former]<br>\
associate in the midst of Hell-fire: but some read<br>\
↓ هل انتم مُطْلِعُونَ فَأَطْلِعَ [in the CK فاطَّلَعَ, but<br>\
it is expressly said in the O that the hemzeh is with<br>\
damm and the ط quiescent and the ل with kesr;<br>\

appearance [or rather sight, is knowledge, or<br>\
certain knowledge]. (Fr, TA in art. انس. [See<br>\

And-accord. to some, اِطِّلَاعُ الحِجَابِ means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The stretching out the head [and looking over<br>\

see مُضْطَلِعٌ: and see an instance in the first paragraph of art. علو.]<br>\
-A3-  And accord. to Kr, اِلِا طّلَاعُ<br>\
signifies also النَّجَاةُ. (TA. [But I think that both<br>\
words are mistranscribed, and that Kr explained<br>\

with a secret.])<br>\
10<br>\

(K, TA;) or the طَلْع is what comes forth from<br>\
the palm-tree and becomes dates if the tree is<br>\
female; and if the tree is male it does not become<br>\
dates, but is eaten in its fresh state, or is left upon<br>\
the palm-tree a certain number of days until there<br>\
becomes produced in it a white substance like<br>\
flour, [i. e. the pollen,] having a strong odour,<br>\
and with this the female is fecundated; (Msb;)<br>\
or a certain white thing that appears from the<br>\
كِمّ [or spathe] of the palm-tree, to the colour of<br>\
which [that of] the teeth are likened, and to the odour<br>\
