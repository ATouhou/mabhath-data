طَشَّتِ السَّمَآءُ, (S, A, O, K,) aor.<br>\
طَشِ3َ and<br>\
طَشُ3َ,<br>\
(O, K,) inf. n. طَشٌّ, (TK,) The sky let fall rain<br>\
such as is called طَشّ [q. v.]; as also ↓ اطشّت.<br>\
(S, A, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] طَشَّ [as meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He sprinkled the moisture from his nose like<br>\
fine rain] is said of one affected with the malady<br>\
termed طُشَّة, when he blows his nose. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And طُشَّ, (O, K,) with damm, (K,) He (a man)<br>\
was, or became, affected with the malady termed<br>\
طُشَّة: (O, K:) but Az says that the [better]<br>\
known word is طُشِئَ. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَطْشَ3َ see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
طَشٌّ and ↓ طَشِيشٌ Weak [or fine] rain, (S, A,<br>\
O, K,) but exceeding what is termed رَذَاذٌ: (S, O,<br>\
K:) or the former is less than رَذَاذ: (El-Khattábee,<br>\
and Suh in TA art. رذ:) or rain exceeding what<br>\
is termed رَِكٌّ, but less than what is termed قِطْقِطٌ:<br>\
(TA:) or the first of rain; (L, TA;) next to<br>\
which is what is termed رَشٌّ: (L:) [but see these<br>\
other terms for rain: طِشَاشٌ and طُشُوشٌ are pls.<br>\
of طَشٌّ; both mentioned in the O, though not<br>\
there said to be pls. of طَشٌّ:] one says, أَصَابَنَا<br>\
طِشَاشٌ وَرِشَاشٌ [Rains such as are termed طشاش<br>\
and رشاش fell upon us]. (O.)<br>\
طُشَّةٌ and ↓ طُشَاشٌ, both with damm, A malady<br>\
like the [rheum termed] زُكَام, (O, K,) incident to<br>\
human beings: said by El-Kutabee to be termed طُشَّة<br>\
because when he who is affected with it blows his<br>\
nose he sprinkles the moisture from it like fine<br>\
rain (إِذَا اسْتَنْثَرَ طَشَّ): but the [better] known<br>\
word is طُشْأَةٌ (O.) [See also the next paragraph.]<br>\
طِشَّة is said in the K to signify A young child;<br>\
its author having app. understood a young child<br>\
to be meant thereby in a trad. respecting the<br>\
[plant called] حَزَاة, in which it is said, يَشْتَرِيهَا<br>\
أَكَايِيسُ الصِّبْيَانِ لِلطِّشَّةِ [evidently meaning, Intelligent children purchase it for the malady<br>\
termed طِشَّة, this word being doubtless either a<br>\
dial. var. of طُشَّة, or a mistranscription]: that<br>\
طشّة here denotes children is refuted by another<br>\
relation of the trad., يَشْرَبُهَا أَكَايِيسُ النِّسَآءِ لِلطُشَّةِ<br>\
[i. e. intelligent women drink a preparation of it<br>\
for the طُشَّة]. (TA.)<br>\
طَشَاشٌ i. q. رَشَاشٌ [i. e. Such as is sprinkled, or<br>\
scattered,] (K, TA) of rain: or such as is weak.<br>\
(TA.) [Not to be mistaken for the pls. طِشَاشٌ<br>\
and رِشَاشٌ: see طَشٌّ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, app., and,<br>\
if so, tropical, Weakness of sight: whence the<br>\
prov., الطَّشَاشُ وَلَا العَمَى [Weakness of sight, and<br>\
not blindness]. (TA.)<br>\
طُشَاشٌ: see طُشَّةٌ.<br>\
طَشِيشٌ: see طَشٌّ.<br>\
أَرْضٌ مطْشُوشَةٌ Land upon which has fallen rain<br>\
such as is termed طَشٌّ. (S, A, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And رَجُلٌ<br>\
مَطْشُوشٌ A man affected with the malady termed<br>\
طُشَّة. (TA.)<br>\
