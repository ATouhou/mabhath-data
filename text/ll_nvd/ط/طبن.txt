men; (TA;) as also ↓ طَبَنٌ. (K, TA. [Freytag<br>\
adds طِبْنٌ and طُبْنٌ in this sense; but they are<br>\
mentioned in the K as syns. of طَبْنٌ meaning a<br>\
certain game: and Golius adds, instead of these<br>\
two, طِبِنٌ and طُبُنٌ, which are altogether<br>\
wrong.]) ―<br>\

constructed, therewith is thus called. (TA.)<br>\

certain game, (S, K, TA,) [said to be] played by<br>\
children, by means of a circular line, [drawn on<br>\
the ground, (but see what follows,)] and [also]<br>\
called by them الرَّحَى; (TA;) called in Pers.<br>\
سِهْ بَرَهٌ, or سِيدَرَهِ, (accord. to different copies of<br>\
the S,) or سِدْرَه, (accord. to some copies of the K,<br>\
and the TA, [this and سِيدَرَه being app. for سِهٌ<br>\
دَرَهٌ, which is syn. with سِهْ بَرَهْ,] in a MS. copy of<br>\
the K سَذْ مَرَهْ, and in the CK سِدْ مَزْه, [both<br>\
app. mistranscriptions for سِهْ بَرَهْ,]) i. e. “ having<br>\
three doors; ” (TA;) [app. the same that is sometimes called in Pers. سِهْ دَرَكْ;] the game that is<br>\
called in Turkish طوقورجون [and طُوقُرْجِنْ],<br>\
and in Arabic called also قرق; (TK;) [i. e. قِرْقٌ,<br>\
which is said in the K and TA in art. قرق to be<br>\
the game called سُدَّر; accord. to an explanation<br>\
and diagram there given, played by means of<br>\
twenty-four lines, composed of four squares, or<br>\
parallelograms, one of these having within it<br>\
another, the latter having within it another, and<br>\
this last having within it another; to which are<br>\
added a line drawn from each angle of the outermost of these to the corresponding angle of the<br>\
innermost and another line drawn from the<br>\
middle of each side of the outermost to the middle<br>\
of the corresponding side of the innermost; within<br>\
which combination of twenty-four lines they place<br>\
(يَضَعُونَ, in the CK يَصُفُّونَ,) pebbles. سُدَّر is<br>\
evidently from the Pers. سِهْ دَرَهْ: it is said in the<br>\
TA in art. سدر to be also pronounced سِدَّر and<br>\
سَدَّر, and to be a Pers. term arabicized. Golius,<br>\
without mentioning any other authority than that<br>\
of the K, explains طُبَنٌ as follows: “ Pers.<br>\
سَدَرَهْ, Turc. دُقُرْجُنْ اُويُنِى, Græc.<br>\
τριώδιον, Trium,<br>\
vel novem, scruporum ludus. ” Freytag explains<br>\
the same word as meaning “ Triodii seu trivalli<br>\
ludus; ” adding a loose rendering of the explanation of قِرْق in the K.]<br>\
