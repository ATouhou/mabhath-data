طَلْسَمَ He (a man) made his face to be<br>\
displeasing, or odious; (M, L, TA;) he contracted it; or made it austere, or morose: and so<br>\
طَرْمَسَ, and طَلْمَسَ, (L, TA,) and طَرْسَمَ. (TA<br>\
in art. طلمس.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He (a man) bent down<br>\
his head; or lowered his eyes, looking towards the<br>\
ground; or was, or became, silent; syn. أَطْرَقَ:<br>\

[And, accord. to Golius, He receded, or drew<br>\
back, from fight; followed by عَنْ: (one of the<br>\
significations assigned in the K to طَرْسَمَ:) he<br>\
mentions this as on the authority of J: perhaps<br>\
he found it in a copy of the S in art. طرمس (in<br>\
which الطَّرْمَسَةُ is expl. as meaning الاِنْقِبَاضُ and<br>\
النُّكُوصُ), or in some other art. of that work in<br>\
which I do not remember to have seen it.<br>\

طَلِسْمٌ, and طِلِسْمٌ, and طِلِّسْمٌ, and طَلْسَمٌ, and<br>\
طَلْسِمٌ, and طِلْسَمٌ,] said by MF to be a Pers.,<br>\

the Greek<br>\
τέλεσμα;] but [SM says] in my<br>\
opinion it is Arabic; a name for A concealed<br>\
secret; [i. e. a mystery: hence our word talisman: accord. to common modern usage, it signifies mystical devices or characters, astrological<br>\

image, or some other thing, upon which such<br>\
devices, or characters, are engraved or inscribed;<br>\
