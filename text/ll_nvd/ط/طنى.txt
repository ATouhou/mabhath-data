طَنَىَ, (S, K,) inf. n. طَنًى, (S,)<br>\
said of a camel, He had his spleen adhering to his<br>\
side in consequence of vehement thirst: (S:) or,<br>\
said of a man, he had his spleen and his lungs<br>\
adhering to the ribs on the left side, (K, TA,) so<br>\
that, sometimes, they become putrid and black;<br>\
but mostly this is the case in camels; (TA;) as<br>\
also ↓ اطنى: (K:) or he (a man) had a tertian<br>\
fever, and his spleen in consequence became<br>\
enlarged: (Lh, * TA:) and, said of a camel, his<br>\
spleen became enlarged in consequence of the [disease<br>\
of the lungs called] نُحَاز. (Lh, TA.) [And طَنِئَ<br>\
is a dial. var. thereof.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And, said of a man,<br>\
i. q. ضَنِىَ [i. e. He was, or became, slender, and<br>\
small in body: or diseased, disordered, or sick: or<br>\

him of the disorder of the spleen mentioned above;<br>\
(S, K;) namely, a camel, (S,) or a man: (K:)<br>\
and he cauterized him (i. e. his camel) in his<br>\

طنّى بَعِيرَهُ فِى جَنْبَيْهِ he cauterized his camel [in<br>\
his sides] by reason of the disorder above mentioned: and the cure [or curing] of that disorder<br>\
is [also] the taking a wooden peg, and laying him<br>\
[i. e. the camel] upon his side on the ground, and<br>\
making, between his ribs, incisions [therewith], not<br>\
penetrating through. (TA.)<br>\

(i. e. a sick man) with somewhat of life remaining in him. (IAar, TA.) One says, هٰذِهِ حَيَّةٌ لَا<br>\
تُطْنِى This is a serpent that will not suffer him<br>\
who is bitten by it to survive; (ISk, * S, * K;)<br>\
that kills instantly: (ISk, S:) or that will not<br>\

(ISk, S.) And ضَرَبَهُ ضَرْبَةً لَا تُطْنِى He struck<br>\
him a blow that would not be slow in killing him.<br>\
(TA.) And لَدَغَتْهُ حَيَّةٌ فَأَطْنَتْهُ [A serpent bit him<br>\
