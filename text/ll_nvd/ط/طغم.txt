and of beasts, or birds, of prey: (TA:) n. un.<br>\
with ة; (S, K;) applied to the male and the<br>\

derivation is not known. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  يَا طَغَامَ الأَحْلَامِ,<br>\
said by &#39;Alee to the people of El-&#39;Irák, is a<br>\
phrase of the same class as إِشْفَى المِرْفَقِ, [i. e. an<br>\
instance of a subst. used as an epithet,] as<br>\
though he said يَا ضِعَافَ الأَحْلَامِ [O ye weak in<br>\
respect of the qualities of forbearance]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
طَغَامُ الكَلَامِ means (tropical:)  Low, or vile, speech: one<br>\
says, كَلَامُ الطَّغَامِ طَغَامُ الكَلَامِ (tropical:)  [The speech of<br>\
the low, ignoble, &amp;c., is low, or vile, speech].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
طَغَامَةٌ Foolish; stupid; or having little, or no,<br>\

and lowness, ignobleness, or meanness. (K.)<br>\
طغو and طغى<br>\
1<br>\
طَغَى, aor. يَطْغَى; (S, M, Msb, TA, &amp;c.;)<br>\
not mentioned in the K [in art. طغى, but in<br>\
some copies thereof mentioned in art طغو]; perhaps dropped by the copyist; (TA;) and طَغَا,<br>\
aor. يَطْغُو; and طَغِىَ, aor. يَطْغَى; (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
inf. n. طَغْىٌ, which is of the first, though mentioned in the K as being of the last; (TA;) and<br>\
طُغْيَانٌ, (S, K,) which is also of the first, and<br>\
second, (S,) or of the last, as also طِغْيَانٌ, (K,)<br>\
mentioned by Ks as from some of the tribe of<br>\
Kelb; (TA;) or طُغْيَانٌ is a simple subst.;<br>\
(Msb;) and طَغْيَا, mentioned by Az as an inf. n.<br>\
[app. of the first]; (TA;) and the inf. n. of the<br>\
second is طَغْوٌ, (Msb,) or طُغُوٌّ, (K accord. to the<br>\
TA,) like عُلُوٌّ, (TA,) or طَغْوَى, (so in some<br>\
copies of the K,) and طَغْوَى, mentioned as an<br>\
inf. n. by Az, (TA,) and طُغْوَانٌ; (K, and mentioned in the S as syn. with طُغْيَانٌ;) and the<br>\
inf. n. of طَغِىَ is طَغًى; (Msb, TA;) He<br>\
exceeded the just, or common, limit or measure;<br>\
was excessive, immoderate, inordinate, or exorbitant; (S, Msb, K, TA;) [and particularly] in<br>\
disobedience: (S, * Msb, * TA:) he exalted himself, and was inordinate in infidelity: he was<br>\
extravagant in acts of disobedience and in wrongdoing: (K:) accord. to El-Harállee, الطُّغْيَانُ<br>\
signifies the acting wrongfully in respect of the<br>\
limits of things and the measures thereof. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] طَغَى, in the K طَغِىَ, but the former<br>\
is the right, (TA,) or طَغَا, (Msb,) said of a<br>\
torrent, (Msb,) or of water, (K, TA,) (tropical:)  It rose<br>\
high, (Msb, K, TA,) so as to exceed the ordinary<br>\
limit in copiousness: (Msb:) or طَغَى or طَغَا,<br>\
(accord. to different copies of the S,) said of a<br>\
torrent, (assumed tropical:)  it brought much water: and, said of<br>\
the sea, (assumed tropical:)  its waves became raised, or in a state<br>\
of commotion: and, said of the blood, (assumed tropical:)  it became<br>\
roused, or excited. (S.) [Hence also the phrase<br>\
طَغَا مِرْقَمُكَ (assumed tropical:)  Thy pen has exceeded its due limit:<br>\
see art. رقم.] ―<br>\
-b3-  طَغَتِ البَقَرَةُ, (K,) aor.<br>\
1َ2َ3َ, (TA,)<br>\
means The بَقَرَة [i. e. the bovine antelope called<br>\
بَقَرَةُ الوَحْشِ (see طَغْيَا)] uttered a cry or cries. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اطغاهُ It, (i. e. wealth, S,) or he, (a man,<br>\
Msb,) made him to exceed the just, or common,<br>\
limit or measure; to be excessive, immoderate,<br>\
inordinate, or exorbitant. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
6<br>\
تطاغى المَوْجُ [app. The waves conflicted, or<br>\
dashed together, with excessive vehemence]: a<br>\
phrase mentioned by Z. (TA.)<br>\
طَغًا: see what next follows.<br>\
طَغْىٌ; accord. to the copies of the K ↓ طَغًا,<br>\
but this is incorrect; A sound, or voice; of the<br>\
dial. of Hudheyl: one says, سَمِعْتُ طَغْىَ فُلَانٍ I<br>\
heard the sound, or voice, of such a one: and, as<br>\
in the “ Nawádir,” سَمِعْتُ طَغْىَ القَوْمِ, and طَهْيَهُمْ,<br>\
and دَغْيَهُمْ, I heard the sound, or voice, [or voices,]<br>\
of the people, or party. (TA.)<br>\
طَغْوَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
طَغْيَةٌ The top, or upper part, of a mountain:<br>\
(S, TA:) and any high, or elevated, place; as<br>\
also ↓ طَغْوَةٌ. (TA as from the S: but only the<br>\
latter word is mentioned in this sense in my<br>\
copies of the S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (S) A small quantity<br>\
(نُبْذَةٌ) of anything: (S, K: *) so says AZ. (S.<br>\
[In this sense, and in the two senses following,<br>\
erroneously written in the CK طَغِيَّة.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
A smooth stone or rock. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And, accord.<br>\
to the copies of the K, الطَّغْيَةُ signifies المُسْتَصْعَبُ<br>\
مِنَ الجَبَلِ [as though meaning What is deemed,<br>\
or found, difficult, of the mountain]: but [SM<br>\
says, though I think this doubtful,] it is correctly<br>\
مِنَ الخَيْلِ [meaning what is refractory, or untractable, of horses], as in the M. (TA.)<br>\
طَغْوَى a subst. from the verb طَغَا, (K, TA,)<br>\
[and] so is ↓ طُغْيَانٌ, (Msb,) or the latter is an<br>\
inf. n., (S, K,) and, accord. to Az, so is طَغْوَى,<br>\
and so too is ↓ طَغْيَا, which latter is said by Zj to<br>\
be the original of طَغْوَى: (TA:) it is like طُغْوَانٌ<br>\
and طُغْيَانٌ. (S.) Hence, in the Kur [xci. 11],<br>\
كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ بِطَغْوَاهَا [Thamood disbelieved by<br>\
reason of their exorbitance]; (K, * TA;) meaning<br>\
that they did not believe when they were<br>\
threatened with the punishment of their طُغْيَان:<br>\
or, as is said in the Expos. of Bkh, the meaning<br>\
is, by reason of their acts of disobedience. (TA.)<br>\
طَغْيَا: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  It<br>\
is also a proper name for [The bovine antelope<br>\
called] بَقَرَةُ الوَحْشِ; (K, TA;) from طَغَتِ البَقَرَةُ<br>\
[expl. above: see 1, last sentence]: (TA:) [or,<br>\
as it appears from a citation in the TA, partly<br>\
mistranscribed so as to be unintelligible, طَغْيَا or<br>\
↓ طُغْيَا signifies, accord. to IAar, a بَقَرَة uttering a<br>\
cry or cries, or a loud cry or loud cries:] or<br>\
↓ طُغْيَا with damm accord. to As, or طَغْيَا with<br>\
fet-h accord. to Th, signifies a youngling of the<br>\
بَقَر الوَحْش. (S.)<br>\
طُغْيَا: see what next precedes, in two places.<br>\
طُغْيَانٌ: see طَغْوَى.<br>\
طَاغٍ Any exceeding his, or its, just limit [in an<br>\
absolute sense or] in disobedience. (S, Msb.)<br>\
طَاغِيَةٌ i. q. جَبَّارٌ [i. e. Insolent, tyrannical, &amp;c.];<br>\
(K, TA;) who deviates from the right way or<br>\
course, or trangresses the just limit: (TA:) and<br>\
stupid, or foolish; proud; (K, TA;) wrongful,<br>\
unjust, or injurious, in conduct: (TA:) or one who<br>\
cares not what he does, devouring [the property<br>\
of] men, and oppressing them, and who is not<br>\
turned from his course by a disposition to shun sin<br>\
or crime, nor by fear. (Sh, TA.) [Hence,]<br>\
الطَّاغِيَةُ is an appellation of The king of the رُوم [or<br>\
Greeks of the Lower Empire]; (S, K, TA;)<br>\
applied to him as a surname because of his much<br>\
exorbitance, and corrupt conduct. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
A thunderbolt; syn. صَاعِقَةٌ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
The cry of punishment; by which Thamood were<br>\
destroyed, as mentioned in the Kur [lxix. 5]:<br>\
(S, TA:) or, accord. to Zj, it there means their<br>\
طُغْيَان [or exorbitance]; being a subst. like عَافِيَةٌ<br>\
and عَاقِبَةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also The flood denoted by<br>\
the words of the Kur [lxix. 11] إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَى المَآءُ.<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
طَاغُوتٌ is of the measure فَلَعُوتٌ, from طَغَوْتُ;<br>\
(M, K;) formed by transposition, though like<br>\
لَاهُوتٌ which is not so formed: (S:) it is originally of the measure فَعَلُوتٌ, which is changed to<br>\
فَلَعُوتٌ, so that it becomes طَوَغُوتٌ, and this is<br>\
then altered to طَاغُوتٌ: (Msb, TA:) it is held to<br>\
be altered from طَوَغُوت rather than from طَغَيُوت<br>\
because the transposition of و is more common<br>\
than that of ى, as in شَاكٍ &amp;c.: (M, TA:) or, as<br>\
some say, the ت is a substitute for و, and the<br>\
measure is فَاعُولٌ: and some say that the measure<br>\
is فَاعَلُوتٌ, and that it is originally طَاغَيُوتٌ:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. is طَوَاغِيتُ (S, K) and طَوَاغٍ, (K,)<br>\
the latter mentioned by ISd. (TA.) It signifies<br>\
A devil; (S, Msb, K, TA;) thus expl. by Abu-l-<br>\
&#39;Áliyeh and others, and said to be on the<br>\
authority of &#39;Omar: (TA:) or one that is exorbitant in pride or corruptness or disbelief or disobedience, of the jinn, or genii: (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA:) or الطَّاغُوتُ means [the idol called] اللَّات<br>\
and [that called] العُزَّى; (K;) or thus some<br>\
expl. الجِبْت and الطَّاغُوت [together, in the Kur<br>\
iv. 54]: (TA:) or whatever is worshipped instead, or to the exclusion, of God; (Zj, K, TA;)<br>\
as also الجِبْتُ: (Zj, TA:) and the idols [in<br>\
general]: (K:) or it is of the idols, and of the<br>\
jinn, or genii, and of mankind: (Akh, TA:) or<br>\
he who turns from the good way: (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA:) and the diviner: (S, K, TA:) and the<br>\
enchanter: thus expl. by &#39;Ikrimeh; and said to<br>\
mean thus in the Kur iv. 63: and so الجِبْتُ<br>\
accord. to Zj: (TA:) and any head, or leader,<br>\
of error: (S, K:) and the exorbitant in pride or<br>\
corruptness or disbelief or disobedience, of the<br>\
people of the Scripture: (K:) it is used as a<br>\
sing., (S, K,) as in the Kur iv. 63; (S;) and as<br>\
a pl., (S, K,) as in the Kur ii. 259; (S;) and<br>\
masc. and fem., (Msb, TA,) as fem. in the Kur<br>\
xxxix. 19: (TA:) or by الجِبْت is meant Hoyeí<br>\
Ibn-Akhtab; and by الطَّاغُوت, Kaab Ibn-ElAshraf: (I&#39;Ab, K:) and [the pls.] طَوَاغِيتُ and<br>\
طَوَاغٍ signify [sometimes] idol temples: so says<br>\
El-Háfidh in the preface to the “ Fet-h ” [i. e.<br>\
his celebrated work entitled “ Fet-h el-Bári ”].<br>\
