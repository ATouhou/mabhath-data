طَالَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) said by some to be of<br>\
the class of قَرُبَ, being made by them to accord<br>\
in from with its contr., which is قَصُرَ, and by<br>\
others said to be of the class of قَالَ, (Msb,) first<br>\
pers. طُلْتُ, [said to be] originally طَوُلْتُ, because<br>\
one says طَوِيلٌ, [not طَائِلٌ, when using it as an<br>\
intrans. v.,] (S, O,) aor. يَطُولُ, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\
طُولٌ, (S, * O, * Msb, K,) It (a thing, S, O, Msb)<br>\
was, or became, elongated, or extended; [i. e. it<br>\
was, or became, long; and it was, or became, tall,<br>\
or high; which meanings are sometimes more<br>\
explicitly denoted in order to avoid ambiguity,<br>\
as when one says طَالَ عَلَى وَجْهِ الأَرْضِ it was, or<br>\
became, elongated, or extended, upon the surface<br>\
of the earth or ground; and طَالَ فِى السَّمَآءِ it was,<br>\
or became, elongated, or extended, towards (lit.<br>\
into) the sky;] (S, O, Msb, K;) and ↓ استطال<br>\
signifies the same. (S, O, K.) It is also said of<br>\
any time that is extended; and of anxiety that<br>\
cleaves to one continually; and the like: [see<br>\
طُولٌ, below:] thus one says طَالَ اللَّيْلُ [The<br>\
night became long, or protracted]: (TA:) [and thus<br>\
طَالَ عَلَيْهِمُ الأَمَدُ, in the Kur lvii. 15, means The<br>\
time became extended, or prolonged, unto them:]<br>\
and عَلَيْهِمُ العُمُرُ ↓ تَطَاوَلَ, in the Kur xxviii. 45,<br>\
means, in like manner, [Life was prolonged unto<br>\
them; or] their lives became long, or prolonged:<br>\
(Jel:) and طال المَجْلِسُ The time of the assembly<br>\
was, or became, extended, or prolonged: (Msb:)<br>\
and طال الهَمُّ [Anxiety became protracted]. (TA.)<br>\
[One says also طَالَمَا فَعَلَ كَذَا Long time did he<br>\
thus; and the like; with the restrictive ما: see<br>\
Har p. 17.]<br>\
-A2-  When trans. [without a particle<br>\
it is of the class فَعَلَ; not فَعُلَ, because this is<br>\
not trans.: (TA:) one says طُلْتُهُ meaning I<br>\
exceeded him, or surpassed him, in الطُّول [i. e.<br>\
tallness; or I overtopped him]: and also in<br>\
الطَّوْل [i. e. beneficence, and excellence, &amp;c.]. (S,<br>\
O, K.) See 3. A poet says,<br>\
إِنَّ الفَرَزْدَقَ صَخْرَةٌ عَارِيَةٌ<br>\
طَالَتْ فَلَيْسَ تَنَالُهَا الأَوْعَالُ<br>\
[Verily El-Farezdak is a bare rock that has<br>\
exceeded in height the mountain-goats so that the<br>\
mountain-goats do not reach it]: he means طَالَتِ<br>\
الأَوْعَالَ. (TA.) And it is said in a trad., فَطَالَ<br>\
العَبَّاسُ عُمَرَ i. e. And El-&#39;Abbás exceeded &#39;Omar<br>\
in tallness of stature. (TA.) And you say, طَالَهُ<br>\
فِى الحَسَبِ [He excelled him in the grounds of<br>\
pretension to respect or honour]. (K and TA in<br>\
explanation of شَرَفَهُ: in the CK [erroneously]<br>\
طاوَلَهُ.)<br>\
-A3-  One says also, طال عَلَيْهِ, (S,) or<br>\
عَلَيْهِمْ, (Msb, K,) the verb in this case being of<br>\
the class of قَالَ, aor. يَطُولُ, (Msb,) inf. n. طَوْلٌ;<br>\
(S, * Msb;) and ↓ تطوّل; (S, Msb, K;) and<br>\
↓ اطال; (Msb;) He bestowed, or conferred, a<br>\
benefit or benefits, or a favour or favours, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) upon him, (S,) or upon them. (Msb,<br>\
K.) And عَلَيْنَا بِشَىْءٍ ↓ تطوّل He gave to us a<br>\
thing; like تَنَوَّلَ; but the latter is said by Aboo-Mihjen to be used only in relation to good; and<br>\
the former, sometimes, in relation to good and<br>\
to evil. (TA in art. نول.)<br>\

طوّلهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَطْوِيلٌ; (O;)<br>\
and ↓ اطالهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) and ↓ أَطْوَلَهُ, (S, O,<br>\
K,) inf. n. إِطَالَةٌ; (O;) both signify the same;<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K;) He elongated it; extended it;<br>\
lengthened it; or made it long, or tall or high;<br>\
(S, * O, Msb;) syn. مَدَّهُ, (S, * O, * Msb,) and جَعَلَهُ<br>\
طَوِيلًا. (O, TA.) You say, طَوَّلْتُ الحَدِيدَةَ I<br>\
elongated, or lengthened, the piece of iron. (Msb.)<br>\
And اللّٰهُ بَقَآءَهُ ↓ اطال God extended, or prolonged,<br>\
his continuance [in life]; or may God extend, &amp;c.<br>\
(Msb.) And المَجْلِسَ ↓ اطال He extended, or<br>\
prolonged, the time of the assembly. (Msb.) And<br>\
طوَّل لِلْفَرَسِ, (S, O,) or لِلدَّابَّةِ, (Msb, K,) He<br>\
slackened [or lengthened] (S, O, Msb, K) the<br>\
tether, (S, O, K,) or rope, (Msb,) of the horse,<br>\
(S, O,) or of the beast, (Msb, K,) in the place<br>\
of pasture, (S, O, K,) or that it might pasture<br>\
[more largely]: (Msb:) and لَهَا الطِّوَلَ ↓ اطال<br>\
and الطِّيَلَ [signify the same]. (TA, from a<br>\
trad.) And [hence] طوّل لَهُ (inf. n. as above, S)<br>\
He granted him a delay, or respite; (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K;) said of God: (S:) and فِى ↓ المُطَاوَلَةُ<br>\
الأَمْرِ means التَّطْوِيلُ فِيهِ; (Msb;) [i. e.] طاولهُ<br>\
signifies he delayed, or deferred, with him, (S, O,<br>\
K, TA,) فِى الأَمْرِ [in the affair], (S, O,) or فِى<br>\

promise]. (TA.) [And طوّل عَلَيْهِ and ↓ تطوّل<br>\
He was prolix, or tedious, to him: see 2 in art.<br>\
بسق; and see an ex. of the former voce حَوْزٌ.]<br>\

طَاْوَلَ ↓ طَاوَلَنِى فَطُلْتُهُ He contended with me for<br>\
superiority (Ks, O, TA) in الطُّول [i. e. tallness],<br>\
and also in الطَّوْل [i. e. beneficence, and excellence,<br>\
&amp;c.], and I exceeded him, or surpassed him, therein. (S, O, K.) بِكَ أُطَاوِلُ occurs in a prayer of<br>\
the Prophet, and is from الطَّوْلُ, meaning [By<br>\
means of Thee I contend for] superiority over the<br>\
enemies. (O.) One says also, طَاوَلَهُ بِالكِبَرِ وَقَالَ<br>\
أَنَا أَكْبَرُ مِنْكَ [He contended, or disputed, with him<br>\
for superiority in greatness, and said, I am greater<br>\

tall children, (S, A, O, K,) or a tall child. (K.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., (S,) or in a prov., not a trad.,<br>\
(K,) but IAth declares it to be a trad., and in the<br>\
trads. of the Prophet are many celebrated provs.,<br>\
(MF,) إِنَّ القَصِيرَةَ قَدْ تُطِيلُ [Verily the short<br>\
woman sometimes brings forth tall children], (S,<br>\

يَتَطَاوَلُ لِلْأَفْنَانِ وَيَجْتَذِبُهَا بِالمِحْجَنِ [He stretches<br>\
himself up towards the branches, and draws them<br>\

حرق.) And it is said in a trad., تطاول عَلَيْهِمُ<br>\

↓ استطال signify the same; (Az, S, O, Msb, K,<br>\
TA;) He held up his head with a show of<br>\
superiority over him; (Az, TA;) [i. e. he behaved haughtily, arrogantly, overweeningly, overbearingly, domineeringly, or proudly, towards<br>\

(O:) and فِى عِرْضِ النَّاسِ ↓ الاِسْتِطَالَةُ occurs in a<br>\
trad. as meaning the contemning of men, and<br>\
exalting oneself above them, and reviling them,<br>\
vilifying them, or detracting from their reputation. (TA.) One says also تطاول بِمَا عِنْدَهُ He<br>\

is opposed to استطار: see مُسْتَطِيلٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  See also<br>\
6, in four places.<br>\
-A2-  This verb is also used, by<br>\
Z and Bd, in a trans. sense; and استطالهُ, occurring in the “ Mufassal ” [of Z] is expl. as meaning عَدَّهُ طَوِيلًا [He reckoned it long, &amp;c.]; and<br>\
in like manner it is used by Es-Saad in the<br>\
“ Mutowwal: ” but this usage is on the ground<br>\
of analogy [only]; for, accord. to the genuine<br>\
lexical usage, it is intransitive. (TA.)<br>\
طَوْلٌ [is originally an inf. n.: (see طَالَ عَلَيْهِ:)<br>\
and, used as a simple subst.,] signifies Beneficence;<br>\
and bounty: (S, TA:) and [a benefit, a favour,<br>\
a boon, or] a gift. (Har p. 58.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, (O,<br>\
K, TA,) as also ↓ طَائِلٌ and ↓ طَائِلَةٌ, (K, TA,)<br>\
Excellence, excess, or superabundance: and power,<br>\
or ability: and wealth, or competence: and ampleness of circumstances: (O, K, TA:) and superiority,<br>\
or ascendancy. (O, TA.) One says, لِفُلَانٍ عَلَى<br>\
فُلَانٍ طَوْلٌ To such a one belongs excellence, or<br>\
superabundance, above such a one. (O. [And<br>\
the like is said in the Mgh.]) And it is said<br>\
in the Kur [iv. 29], وَمَنْ لَمْ يَسْتَطِعْ مِنْكُمْ طَوْلًا<br>\
أَنْ يَنْكِحَ المُحْصَنَاتِ, meaning And such of you<br>\
as is not able to obtain superabundance so that he<br>\
may marry the free women, let him marry a<br>\
female slave; (Mgh;) i. e. such as is not able<br>\
to give the dowry of the free woman, (Mgh, O,<br>\
TA,) as expl. by Zj. (Mgh, TA.) In the phrase<br>\
طَوْلُ الحُرَّةِ, the former word is originally the inf. n.<br>\
of the verb in طَالَ عَلَيْهَا meaning “ he benefited<br>\
her; ” because, when one is able to give the<br>\
dowry of the free woman, and pays it, he<br>\
benefits her: or, as some of the lawyers says,<br>\
this phrase means The superabundance of the<br>\
means of sustenance that suffices for the marrying<br>\
of the free woman, agreeably with a saying of<br>\
Az: or, as some say, طول means wealth, or<br>\
competence; and the phrase is originally طَوْلٌ<br>\
إِلَى الحُرَّةِ, i. e. ampleness of wealth such as<br>\
supplies the means of attaining to the free woman:<br>\
or originally طَوْلٌ عَلَى الحُرَّةِ, meaning power, or<br>\
ability, for the marrying of the free woman:<br>\
(Msb:) Esh-Shaabee is related to have used the<br>\
phrase الطَّوْلُ إِلَى الحُرَّةِ; and in like manner are<br>\
I&#39;Ab and Jábir and Sa&#39;eed Ibn-Jubeyr. (Mgh.)<br>\
ذِى الطَّوْلِ in the Kur xl. 3 means The Possessor<br>\
of all-sufficiency, and of superabundance, or of<br>\
bounty: (O:) or the Possessor of power: or of<br>\
bounty, and beneficence. (TA.) And أُولُو الطَّوْلِ<br>\
مِنْهُمْ in the Kur ix. 87 means Those, of them,<br>\
who are possessors of superabundance, and of<br>\
opulence. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also طِوَلٌ, latter half, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
طُولٌ [is originally an inf. n.: (see 1, first<br>\
sentence:) and, used as a simple subst.,] signifies<br>\
Length; and tallness, or height; contr. of عَرْضٌ;<br>\
(S, O, Msb;) or of قِصَرٌ: (M, TA:) pl. أَطْوَالٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) it is in man and other animals, and in<br>\
inanimate things: (TA:) in real things, or<br>\
substances; and also in ideal things, or attributes, as time and the like. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
[One says, قَطَعَهُ طُولًا and بِالطُّولِ He cut it<br>\
lengthwise.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And The utmost extent of time.<br>\
(TA.) You say, لَا أُكَلِّمُهُ طُولَ الدَّهْرِ (S, O,<br>\
TA) and الدَّهْرِ ↓ طَوَالَ, (S, O, K, * TA,) both<br>\
meaning the same, (S, O, TA,) i. e. [I will not<br>\
speak to him] during the utmost extent of time.<br>\
(K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [In geography, The longitude of a<br>\
place: pl. as above.] ―<br>\
-b4-  See also طِوَلٌ, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
طَوَلٌ Length in the upper lip of the camel, (M,<br>\
K, TA,) beyond the lower. (M, TA.)<br>\
طُوَلٌ: see طِوَلٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also pl. of طُولَى, fem. of<br>\
أَطْوَلُ [q. v.].<br>\

O, K,) and ↓ طِيَلٌ, for which also ↓ طِيَلٌّ occurs<br>\

this is disapproved by Az, (TA,) and ↓ تِطْوَلٌ,<br>\
(K,) A tether; i. e. the rope that is extended for<br>\
a horse or similar beast, and attached to which he<br>\

such a beast is bound: (K:) a long rope thus<br>\
used: (TA:) or with which one binds him, holding its extremity, and letting the beast pasture:<br>\
(K, TA:) or of which one of the two ends is<br>\
bound to a stake, and the other to the fore leg of<br>\
a horse, in order that he may go round about<br>\
bound thereby, and pasture, and not go away at<br>\
random. (TA.) An ex. of the first of these<br>\
words occurs in a verse of Tarafeh cited voce<br>\
ثِنْىٌ. (S, O.) And it is said in a trad. that<br>\
when a man of an army alights in a place, he<br>\
may debar others from the extent of the طِوَل of<br>\
his horse. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَرْخَى لَهُ الطِّوَلَ [lit. meaning<br>\
He relaxed, or slackened, to him the tether]<br>\
means [also] (tropical:)  he left him to his own affair. (A<br>\
and TA in art. رخو.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And one says, طَالَ طِوَلُكَ<br>\
and ↓ طِيَلُكَ and ↓ طِيلُكَ and ↓ طُولُكَ and<br>\

فَانْزِلِ ↓ وَقُلْنَا لَهُ طَالَ طَوْلُكَ<br>\
meaning [He came to us, and we did not repel<br>\
him since he came as a nightly visiter, and we<br>\
said to him,] Thy case in respect of the length of<br>\
the journey and the endurance of travel [has been<br>\
long, therefore alight thou: or the right reading<br>\
may be ↓ طُولُكَ, which is better known]: or, as<br>\
some relate it, ↓ طِيلُكَ. (TA.) [It is also said<br>\
that] طِوَلٌ is a pl. [or rather a coll. gen. n.] of<br>\
which the sing. [or n. un.] is ↓ طِوَلَةٌ; and in<br>\
like manner, ↓ طِيَلٌ, of ↓ طِيَلَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\

طِيَلٌ: see طِوَلٌ, in three places.<br>\
طَالَةٌ A she-ass: (O, K:) said to occur [as<br>\

sometimes with طَوِيلٌ and طَوِيلَةٌ,] in a verse of<br>\
El-Farezdak cited voce عَزِيزٌ: (O, TA:) [it seems,<br>\
from a comparison of explanations of سُرْحُوبٌ<br>\
and سَلْهَبٌ &amp;c. in the S and K, that طَوِيلٌ<br>\
applied to a horse or the like generally signifies<br>\
long-bodied:] طَوِيلٌ is the only epithet, known to<br>\
IJ, of the measure فَعِيلٌ having the ف and ل<br>\
sound and having و for its ع, except صَوِيبٌ and<br>\
قَوِيمٌ; for عَوِيصٌ is [held by him to be only] used<br>\
as a subst.: (M in art. صوب:) the pl. (of طَوِيلٌ<br>\
and طُوَالٌ, TA) is طِوَالٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
طِيَالٌ; (S, O, K;) the latter anomalous, and<br>\
said by IJ to occur only in one verse: (TA:)<br>\
the fem. is طَوِيلَةٌ (Msb, K) and طُوَالَةٌ; (K, *<br>\
TA;) and the pl. of the former of these is<br>\
طَوِيلَاتٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  They said, إِنَّ اللَّيْلَ طَوِيلٌ<br>\
وَلَا يَطُلْ إِلَّا بِخَيْرٍ [Verily the night is long, and<br>\
may it not be long save with good fortune]:<br>\
mentioned by Lh, as expressing a prayer. (TA.)<br>\
And قَصِيرَةٌ مِنْ طَوِيلَةٍ [A short thing from a tall<br>\
thing]; meaning a date from a palm-tree: a<br>\
prov., alluding to the abridging of speech, or<br>\
language. (IAar, Meyd, K.) See also 4. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
الطَّوِيلُ is also the name of A certain kind of<br>\
metre of verse; (S, O, K;) [namely, the first;]<br>\
consisting of فَعُولُنْ مَفَاعِيلُنْ eight [a mistake for<br>\
four] times: (O, TA:) so called because it is<br>\
the longest of all the metres of verse; originally<br>\
comprising forty-eight letters: (TA:) a postclassical term. (S, O, K.)<br>\
طَوِيلَةٌ as a subst.: see طِوَلٌ.<br>\
طُوَّلٌ A certain bird, (S, O, K,) of the aquatic<br>\

TA;) applied to a man; as also, in the same<br>\
sense, ↓ طُوَالٌ, (TA,) the latter having a stronger<br>\
signification than طَوِيلٌ, [with which it is mentioned above as syn.,] (TA voce رَكِيكٌ,) or it<br>\
denotes less than طُوَّالٌ; (O in art. ظرف;) and<br>\
so ↓ طُولَانِىٌّ and ↓ مُطَاوِلٌ, in the dial. of the<br>\
vulgar: طُوَّالٌ has no broken pl., its pl. being<br>\
only طُوَّالُونَ: its fem. is with ة, and so is that of<br>\
طُوَالٌ; each applied to a woman. (TA.)<br>\
طَائِلٌ Benefiting; bestowing, or conferring, a<br>\
benefit or benefits, or a favour or favours. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence its usage in the following exs.] One<br>\
says of that which is vile, or contemptible, (Msb,<br>\
K, TA,) هُوَ غَيْرَ طَائِلٍ, (Msb,) or مَا هُوَ بِطَائِلٍ,<br>\

غَيْرِ طَائِلٍ i. e. [He was shrouded in grave-clothing]<br>\
not of delicate texture, and not of a goodly kind.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence] it signifies [also] Benefit,<br>\
profit, utility, or avail; and excellence: thus in<br>\
the saying, هٰذَا أَمْرٌ لَا طَائِلَ فِيهِ [This is an affair<br>\
in which is no benefit, &amp;c.]: (S, O, TA:) and<br>\
لَمْ يَحْلَ مِنْهُ بِطَائِلٍ [He did not find or experience,<br>\
or get or obtain, from it, or him, any benefit, &amp;c.]:<br>\
it is only used in negative phrases [in this sense]:<br>\
(S, O, K, TA:) and [thus] one says also, نَطَقَ<br>\
بِمَا لَا طَائِلَ تَحْتَهُ [He spoke that in which was no<br>\
profit]. (TA in art. بوق.) See also طَوْلٌ,<br>\

&amp;c.]: (S, O, K:) fem. طُولَى: (S, O, Msb, K:)<br>\
pl. of the former, applied to men, أَطَاوِلُ; (S, O;)<br>\
and of the latter طُوَلٌ. (S, O, Msb, K. *) السَّبْعُ<br>\
الطُّوَلُ, i. e. The seven longer chapters of the<br>\
Kur-án, (O, TA,) are the chapter of البَقَرَة and<br>\
the next five chapters of which the last is الأَعْرَاف,<br>\
and one other, which is the chapter of يُونُس, or<br>\
الأَنْفَال and بَرَآءَة together, these being regarded<br>\
as one chapter, (O, K, TA,) or, as some say,<br>\
الكَهْف, and some say التَّوْبَة [which is the same<br>\
as بَرَآءَة]; and some say [the chapters vulgarly<br>\
called] the حَوَامِيم [which are the fortieth and six<br>\
following chapters]: but the first of all these<br>\
sayings is the right. (TA.) And طُولَى الطُّولَيَيْنِ<br>\

Kur-án], occurring in a trad. of Umm-Selemeh,<br>\
was expl. by her as meaning the chapter of<br>\
الأَعْرَاف: (O:) الطُّولَيَانِ meaning الأَنْعَام and<br>\
الأَعْرَاف. (TA.) أَسْرَعُكُنَّ لُحُوقًا بِى أَطْوَلُكُنَّ يَدًا,<br>\

you in giving. (O.) ―<br>\
