(S:) or in relation to Mahreh, a district<br>\
of &#39;Omán: (Msb:) they are excellent camels,<br>\
that outstrip horses; and some add, that they<br>\
are unequalled in quickness of running, understanding what is desired of them with the least<br>\
training, and having names, by which being<br>\
called, they answer quickly: (Msb:) [and hence,<br>\
any such like camels; i. e. any excellent, fleet,<br>\
camels: (see 4:) n. un. مَهْرِىٌّ:] pl. مَهَارِىُّ<br>\
[which is irreg. like ظَهَارِىٌّ] (S, Msb, K) and<br>\

been dowered with one of her two anklets]: (S,<br>\

[More stupid than she who has been dowered with<br>\
one of her two anklets]: (Mgh:) applied to him<br>\
who has reached the utmost degree of stupidity:<br>\
from the following case: (TA:) a stupid woman<br>\
demanded of her husband her dowry, (K, TA,)<br>\
when he paid her his first visit, and she said, I<br>\
will not obey thee unless thou give me my<br>\
dowry: (TA:) so he pulled off one of her two<br>\
anklets (K, TA) from her foot, (TA,) and gave<br>\
it to her, and she was content with it. (K, TA.)<br>\
In like manner, a certain man gave to another<br>\
property, and he married with it the daughter<br>\
of the giver, and then reproached her for the<br>\
dowry he had given her: so they said, كَالْمَمْهُورَةِ<br>\
مِنْ مَالِ أَبِيهَا [Like her who has been dowered<br>\
from the property of her father]: (K, TA:)<br>\
[a proverb] applied in relation to him who<br>\
reproaches for that which is not his own. (TA.)<br>\
