-b2-  Also, A<br>\
certain tree, two carats&#39; weight (قِيرَاطَانِ) of the<br>\
root of which is an emetic and laxative: (K:) or, as<br>\
in one copy [of the K], a certain plant, in the root<br>\
of which is a poisonous quality (سمية [i. e., سُمِّيَّة]);<br>\
the drinking of a grain of it [in water] causes<br>\
looseness of the bowels, and vomiting, in an excessive<br>\
degree. (TA.) But these properties [says SM]<br>\
are strange, and not mentioned by the physicians.<br>\
Ibn-El-Kutbee says, in [the book entitled]<br>\
مَا لَا يَسَعُ الطَّبِيبَ جَهْلُهُ, مغاث is [the name of]<br>\
roots which are imported, of a hot and moist temperament, in one of the last measures of the second<br>\
degree, (فى اواخر الثانية,) [the degrees of heat<br>\
and cold and dryness and moistness being four,]<br>\
the best of which are the white and soft, inclining<br>\
to yellow: it is fattening, strengthening to the<br>\
limbs or members, of use in cases of fracture and<br>\
contusion, applied in a bandage, and drunk; also<br>\
for the gout (نِقْرِس), and spasmodic contraction<br>\
(تَشَنُّج); and softens hardness of the joints; and<br>\
improves the voice, and clears the throat and lungs;<br>\
and excites to sexual intercourse. Some say, that<br>\
it is the name of] the roots of the wild pomegranate; but this assertion is not of established<br>\
authority. Others say, that it is a kind of<br>\
سُورَنْجَان; and this is not improbable. The<br>\
hakeem [Dáood] says, in the Tedhkireh, مغاث is<br>\
[the name of] a certain plant in El-Kerej (الكرج)<br>\
and the parts adjacent; roots extending deep into<br>\
the earth, and thick, with a rind inclining to black<br>\
and red, which, when peeled off, discloses a substance, between white and yellow: the best thereof<br>\
is the heavy, sweet-scented, in taste inclining to<br>\
sweet, with a slight bitterness. It is said to have<br>\
rough, or coarse, and wide, leaves, like those of the<br>\
radish; and a white flower; and seeds resembling<br>\
the grains of the سُمْنَة, and called قلقل: hence it<br>\
has been imagined to be the pomegranate: and it<br>\
is said to be a species of سورنجان: its strength, or<br>\
virtue, lasts about seven years: and there is a kind<br>\
of it brought from &#39;Abbádán, and towards Syria,<br>\
weak in operation; and it is this which is used in<br>\
Egypt. (TA.) [M. Rouyer, in the Descr. de<br>\
l&#39;Egypte, tome 11 of the sec. ed., p. 452, describes<br>\
it as follows: a root of a whitish colour, mucilaginous, fleshy, or pulpous, and of an aromatic<br>\
odour: it is nutritive and aphrodisiac: it is taken<br>\
in the simple substance; and they make of it a<br>\
sherbet, which should be drunk hot: this root<br>\
comes from the Indies.]<br>\
