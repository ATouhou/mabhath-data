مصّرهُ He made it (namely a town) a مِصْر,<br>\
i. e. a limit, or boundary, between two things.<br>\
(IAar.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَصَّرُوا المَكَانَ, inf. n. تَمْصِيرٌ, They<br>\
made the place, or appointed it to be, a مِصْر<br>\
[meaning a city, or town, such as is thus called].<br>\
(M, * K.) It is said of &#39;Omar, مَصَّرَ الأَمْصَارَ,<br>\
(TA,) which is a phrase like مَدَّنَ المُدُنَ, (S,)<br>\
[and signifying He appointed the cities, or towns<br>\
called أَمْصَار: or] مصّر الامصار signifies he built<br>\
the [cities, or towns, called] امصار: (A:) among<br>\
which امصار were El-Basrah and El-Koofeh.<br>\
(A, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تمصّر It (a place) became a مِصْر [meaning<br>\
a city, or town, such as is thus called]. (M, K.)<br>\
مِصْرٌ A partition, barrier, or thing intervening,<br>\
between two things: (S, M, K:) as also ↓ مَاصِرٌ:<br>\
(K:) and (S) or limit, or boundary, between two<br>\
lands: (M, K:) pl. مُصُورٌ. (S, M.) The people<br>\
of Egypt, (S,) or of Hejer, (M,) or of both,<br>\
(TA,) write in their contracts, (S, M, *) إِشْتَرَى<br>\
فُلَانٌ الدَّارَ بِمُصُورِهَا Such a one bought the house<br>\
with its limits, or boundaries. (S, M, * K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, A great town; syn. بَلَدٌ عَظِيمٌ; (Bd, ii.<br>\
58;). a كُورَة [here meaning city, or provincial<br>\
city]: (M, K:) or a كُورَة (Lth, IF, Msb) in<br>\
which the [ordinances of God which are termed]<br>\
حُدُود are executed, and (Lth, TA) in which the<br>\
[spoil or tribute termed] فَىْء and the [alms<br>\
termed] صَدَقَات are divided (Lth, IF, Msb)<br>\
without consulting the Khaleefeh; such is its<br>\
signification in the language of the Arabs: (Lth,<br>\
TA:) or that [town] whereof the greatest of its<br>\
mosques will not hold, or contain, its inhabitants:<br>\
(KT:) it is masc. and perfectly decl., and fem.<br>\
and imperfectly decl.: (Msb:) [but this remark<br>\
seems properly to relate to the word when used as<br>\
the name of the metropolis of Egypt, and of<br>\
Egypt itself, agreeably with what is said in the S,<br>\
M, and K:] pl. أَمْصَارٌ. (S, M, Msb.) The dual,<br>\
المِصْرَانِ, is applied to El-Koofeh and El-Basrah.<br>\
(S, M, A, K.)<br>\
مَصِيرٌ A gut, an intestine, or a bowel, into which<br>\
the food passes from the stomach; syn. مِعًى:<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K:) or specially, as some say, of a<br>\
bird, and of an animal which has a soft foot, or<br>\
خُفّ, [as the camel,] and of such as have a cloven<br>\
hoof: (M, TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَمْصِرَةٌ (M, K)<br>\
and [of mult.] مُصْرَانٌ, and pl. pl. مَصَارِينُ: (S,<br>\
M, A, Msb, K:) the last accord. to Sb; (M;)<br>\
but some say that it is not established; (A;) and<br>\
Lth says, that it is a mistake; but Az says, that<br>\
it is pl. of مُصْرَانٌ, and that the Arabs have given<br>\
it this form of pl. imagining the م to be a radical<br>\
letter; (TA;) and some say, that مَصِيرٌ is of<br>\
the measure مَفْعِلٌ, [originally مَصْيِرٌ,] derived<br>\
from صَار إِلَيْهِ الطَّعَامُ [“ the food passed to it ”],<br>\
and they say مُصْرَانٌ in like manner as they say<br>\
مُسْلَانٌ as pl. of مَسِيلُ المَآءِ, likening مَفْعِلٌ to<br>\
فَعِيلٌ: (S, TA:) مِصْرَانٌ also is a dial. form of<br>\
مُصْرَانٌ. (Fr, Sgh, TA.) [See also مَصَارّ, in art.<br>\
صر.] ―<br>\
-b2-  مُصْرَانُ الفَارَةِ, (S, Msb,) or مُصْرَانُ الفَأْرِ,<br>\
(Mgh, K,) (tropical:)  A bad kind of dates. (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K.)<br>\
