مَخَضَ اللَّبَنَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
مَخُضَ,<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K,) and<br>\
مَخِضَ, and<br>\
مَخَضَ, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. مَخْضٌ, (Msb,) He churned, or beat and<br>\
agitated, the milk, (Mgh,) in the مِمْخَضَة: (A,<br>\
Mgh:) and (A) he took the butter of the milk:<br>\
(A, K:) or he extracted, or fetched out, the<br>\
butter of the milk, by putting water in it, and<br>\
agitating it: (Msb:) or مَخْضٌ signifies one&#39;s<br>\
agitating the مِمْخَض wherein is the milk of<br>\
which the butter has been taken. (Lth.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] مَخْضٌ relates also to many things.<br>\
(TA.) Thus, you say, (TA) مَخَضَ الشَّىْءَ, (K,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He shook, or<br>\
agitated, the thing vehemently. (K, TA.) It is<br>\
said in a trad., مُرَّ عَلَيْهِ بِجِنَازَةٍ تُمْخَضُ مَخْضًا;<br>\
(L;) or تُمْخَضُ مَخْضَ الزّقّ; (O;) (assumed tropical:)  [A bier<br>\
with a corpse was conveyed past him] being<br>\
shaken, or agitated, quickly; (L, TA;) or being<br>\
shaken, or agitated, vehemently [like as the milkskin is shaken, &amp;c.] (O, TA.) You say also,<br>\
مَخَضَ الدَّلْوَ, (K,) or بِالدَّلْوِ, (Fr, S, O, L,) which<br>\
latter is the correct phrase, (TA,) or مَخَضَ المَآءَ<br>\
بِالدَّلْوِ (A,) and مَخَضَ البِئْرَ بِالدَّلْوِ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
dashed the bucket in the water of the well, to fill<br>\
it: (Fr., S, O, L, K:) or he drew much water<br>\
with the bucket: (A:) and the last, he drew<br>\
much with the bucket from the well, and agitated<br>\
it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence,] مَخَضَ رَأْيَهُ (A,<br>\
Msb) (tropical:)  He turned over, or revolved, his idea,<br>\
or opinion, [in his mind,] and considered what<br>\
would be its results, (Msb,) until the right<br>\
course appeared to him. (A, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
مَخَضَ اللّٰهُ السِّنِينَ حَتَّى كَانَ ذٰلِكَ زُبْدَتَهَا (tropical:)  [God<br>\
caused the years to revolve until that was their<br>\
issue, or result]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And مَخَضَ said<br>\
of a camel, (tropical:)  He brayed (هَدَرَ) in his شِقْشِقَة<br>\
[i.e. faucial bag, or bursa faucium]. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  مَخِضَتْ, (ISh, IAar S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
مَخَضَ;<br>\
(S, K;) or مَخَضَتْ; (so in a copy of the A<br>\
and in a copy of the Mgh) or both; (JK, K;)<br>\
aor. of the latter, as of the former,<br>\
مَخَضَ; (K;)<br>\
and مُخِضَتْ; (ISh, L, K;) but this last is<br>\
disallowed by IAar; (TA;) and the generality<br>\
of Keys and Temeem and Asad say مِخِضَتْ,<br>\
with kesr to the م, [for مَخِضَتْ,] and in like manner they do in the case of every [incipient] letter<br>\
before a guttural letter in words of the measures<br>\
فَعِلْتُ and فَعِيلٌ; (Nuseyr, TA;) inf. n. مَخَاضٌ<br>\
(ISh, S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and مِخَاضٌ (Msb,<br>\
K) and مَخَضٌ; (A;) said of a she-camel,<br>\
(ISh, S,) or of a woman, (IAar,) or absolutely,<br>\
(A, Mgh,) or also absolutely, (Msb, TA, *) of<br>\
a woman, and of a she-camel, and of other<br>\
beasts, (TA,) (tropical:)  She was taken with the pains of<br>\
parturition, (ISh, S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) being<br>\
near to bringing forth; (Msb;) as also ↓ مَخَّضَتْ,<br>\
inf. n. تَمْخِيضٌ; (K;) and ↓ تمخّضت; (ISh,<br>\
and so in some copies of the K;) each of these<br>\
last two is correct; (TA;) and ↓ امتخضت.<br>\
(ISh.) And مَخِضَتْ said of a woman, (tropical:)  Her<br>\
child moved about in her belly, previously to the<br>\
birth: (Ibráheem El-Harbee:) and in like manner, بِوَلَدِهَا ↓ تمخّضت, (S, * TA,) said of a she-camel, (tropical:)  her young one became agitated in her<br>\
belly at the time of bringing forth: (TA:) and<br>\
↓ تمخّضت [alone], said of a ewe, or she-goat,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  she conceived, or became pregnant. (As, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] مَخِضَ السَّحَابُ بِمَائِهِ, and ↓ تمخّض,<br>\
(TA,) and السَّمَآءُ ↓ تمخّضت, (A, TA,) (tropical:)  [The<br>\
cloud, or clouds, and] the sky, or heaven, prepared, or became ready, to rain. (A, TA.)<br>\

like: (K, TA:) as though from المَخَاضُ. (K.)<br>\
&#39;Amr Ibn-Hassán, one of the Benu-l-Hárith-Ibn-Hemmám-Ibn-Murrah, says, (Seer, S,) but the<br>\
saying is also ascribed to Sahm Ibn-Khálid Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abd-Allah Esh-Sheybánee, and to Khálid Ibn-<br>\
Hikk Esh-Sheybánee, (TA,)<br>\
المَنُونُ لَهُ بِيَوْمٍ ↓ تَمَخَّضَتِ<br>\
أَنَى وَلِكُلِّ حَامِلَةٍ تَمَامُ<br>\
meaning [Time, or fortune,] was pregnant with<br>\
a day for him, of which the time of birth had<br>\
come: [for for every one that is pregnant there is<br>\
a term of completion.] (S.)<br>\
2<br>\
مَخَّضَ see مَخِضَتْ.<br>\
4<br>\
امخض اللَّبَنُ The milk attained to the<br>\
proper time for [its being churned, or] having its<br>\
butter taken, or extracted. (S, A, Msb.) In<br>\
the O and K, it is made to signify the same as<br>\
امتخض: but it seems that Sgh has inadvertently<br>\
omitted, after it, the words حَانَ لَهُ أَنْ يُمْخَضَ,<br>\
and that the author of the K has copied him<br>\
without referring to other lexicons. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also امخض, (K,) said of a man, (TA,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
had his she-camels taken with the pains of parturition; (K, TA;) and his she-camel, in like<br>\
manner. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تمخّض It (milk) was, or became, agitated<br>\
in the مِمْخَضَة; (S, A, * TA;) as also ↓ امتخض.<br>\
(S, O, K.) [See also 4.] ―<br>\
-b2-  It (milk) had its<br>\
butter taken. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  It (a child, or young<br>\
one,) moved about in the belly of its mother;<br>\
as also ↓ the latter verb. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also<br>\
مَخِضَتْ and what follows it, to the end of the<br>\
paragraph.<br>\

إِمْتَخَضَ see 5, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see مَخِضَتْ.<br>\
10<br>\
استمخض اللَّبَنُ The milk was slow in<br>\
becoming thick and fit for churning, and its<br>\
butter would hardly, if at all, come forth: such<br>\
is the best of milk, because its butter is in it.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, The milk was slow in acquiring<br>\
flavour after it had been collected in the skin.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مَخْضٌ: see مَخِيضٌ.<br>\
مَخَاضٌ (assumed tropical:)  The pains of parturition; (S, Msb;)<br>\
as also ↓ مِخَاضٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  Applied to she-camels, (tropical:)  Pregnant: (AZ, As, S, ISd, A, Msb,<br>\
K, &amp;c.:) used in this sense as an epithet of<br>\
good omen, whence they augur that their young<br>\
ones will become agitated in their bellies at the<br>\
time of parturition: (ISd:) having their young<br>\
in their bellies: (M, TA:) or such as are called<br>\
عِشَار, that have been ten months pregnant:<br>\
(Th, K:) but ISd says, I have not found this<br>\
explanation of مخاض on any authority beside that<br>\
of Th: (TA:) [see also عُشَرَآءُ:] it has no proper<br>\
sing: (S:) a single one is termed خَلِفَةٌ, (AZ,<br>\
As, S, A, &amp;c,) which is extr. (K, TA) with<br>\
respect to rule: (TA:) or مَخَاضٌ signifies, or<br>\
it signifies also, (accord. to different copies of<br>\
the K,) she-camels in the state in which they are<br>\
from the time when the stallion is sent among<br>\
them (ISd, K) until he brays (حَتَّى يَهْدِرَ), or,<br>\
accord. to another relation, until they are left<br>\
(حتّى تُغْدَرَ), i.e., (ISd,) until he ceases (حتّى<br>\
يَنْقَطِعَ, in the copies of the K, erroneously,<br>\
حتى تنقطع, TA) from covering: (ISd, K:)<br>\
a pl. (K) having no sing. (ISd, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
(S,) اِبْنُ مَخَاضٍ (tropical:)  A young male camel, which,<br>\
(As, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) having completed a year<br>\
(As, S, Mgh) from the day of its birth, (As,)<br>\
has entered upon the second year: (As, S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K:) because his mother, (S, IAth, Mgh,<br>\
K,) from whom he has been separated, (S,) has<br>\
become adjoined to the مَخَاض, (S, IAth, Mgh,<br>\
K,) or pregnant camels, (IAth, K,) whether<br>\
she have conceived or not; (S, IAth, * K; *)<br>\
for they used to make the stallion-camels to cover<br>\
the females a year after these had brought forth,<br>\
(IAth, K, *) in order that their young ones<br>\
might become strong, so that they conceived in<br>\
the second year: (IAth:) or because its mother<br>\
has been covered, and has conceived, and become<br>\
adjoined to the مَخَاض, i.e., to the pregnant<br>\
camels; and this appellation it bears until it has<br>\
completed the second year; but when it has<br>\
entered upon the third, it is called اِبْنُ لَبُونٍ:<br>\
(Msb:) or a young male camel when his mother<br>\
has conceived: (K:) or whose mother has become<br>\
pregnant: or when the she-camels among whom<br>\
is his mother have become pregnant, though she<br>\
have not become so: (IAth, K:) the female is<br>\
called بِنْتُ مَخَاضٍ; (IAth, Msb, K;) or اِبْنَةُ<br>\
مَخَاضٍ: (S:) the pl., (S, Msb, K,) of both the<br>\
male and female appellations, (Msb,) is بَنَاتُ<br>\
مَخَاضٍ, (S, Msb, K,) only; like بَنَاتُ لَبُونٍ and<br>\
بَنَاتُ آوَى. (S.) Sometimes one adds to it the<br>\
article ال, (Msb, K,) saying, اِبْنُ المَخَاضِ:<br>\
(Msb:) [for] ابن مخاض is indeterminate; and<br>\
when you desire to make it determinate, you<br>\
affix the article ال, as above; but this only<br>\
makes it determinate as a generic appellation. (S.)<br>\
مِخَاضٌ: see مَخَاضٌ.<br>\
مَخُوضٌ: see مَاخِضٌ, in two places.<br>\
مَخِيضٌ and ↓ مَمْخُوضٌ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
↓ مَخْضٌ (TA, voce مَحْضٌ, q. v.) [Churned milk:]<br>\
or milk which has been churned (الَّذِى قَدْ مُخِضَ),<br>\
and of which the butter has been taken: (S:)<br>\
or milk of which the butter has been taken:<br>\
(K:) or milk of which the butter has been<br>\
extracted, or fetched out, by putting water in it,<br>\
and agitating it. (Msb.)<br>\
مَاخِضٌ, applied to a she-camel, (ISh, IAar,<br>\

(IAar, Msb, K,) and any pregnant animal, (S,<br>\
A, * Msb,) (tropical:)  Taken with the pains of parturition,<br>\
(ISh, IAar, S, A, Msb,) being near to bringing<br>\
forth; (IAar, Msb, K;) as also ↓ مَخُوضٌ:<br>\
(ISh:) and, applied to a ewe or she-goat,<br>\
having conceived; as also ↓ the latter epithet;<br>\
(As, K;) pl. of the former, مُخَّضٌ (S, Msb, K)<br>\
and مَوَاخِضُ. (A, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The Arabs say, in<br>\
one of their imprecations, صَبَّ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ أُمَّ حُبَيْنٍ<br>\
مَاخِضًا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [May God pour upon thee]<br>\
the night. (Ibn-Buzurj.)<br>\
إِمْخَاضٌ Fresh milk (حَلِيب), (K,) or churned<br>\
milk (لَبَنٌ مَخِيضٌ), (Lth,) as long as it remains<br>\
in the مِمْخَضَة: (Lth, K:) or, as some say, milk<br>\
collected in the place of pasturage until it amounts<br>\
to the quantity of a camel-load: pl. أَمَا خِيضُ.<br>\
(Lth.) You say إِمْخَاضٌ مِنْ لَبَنٍ and إِحْلَابٌ<br>\
مِنْ لَبَنٍ: (Lth:) or the former is of ewes or she-<br>\
goats, or of cows; and the latter, of camels.<br>\
(TA, in art. حلب, q. v.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also مِمْخَضٌ.<br>\
مِمْخَضٌ A skin; syn.; سِقَآءٌ; (K;) as also<br>\
↓ إِمْخَاضٌ, which is mentioned by Sb, and thus<br>\
explained by Seer: (TA:) or a skin (سقاء) in<br>\
which is مَخِيض [or churned milk, &amp;c.]: (TA:)<br>\
or the receptacle in which the milk whereof the<br>\
butter has been taken is agitated: (Lth:) and<br>\
↓ مِمْخَضَةٌ [and app. the former also] the vessel,<br>\
(Mgh,) or receptacle, (Msb,) [generally a skin,]<br>\
in which milk is churned or beaten and agitated;<br>\
(Mgh, K; *) or in which the butter of the milk<br>\
is extracted, or fetched out by putting water in<br>\
it, and agitating it; (Msb;) [i.e. a churn;]<br>\
i. q. إِبْرِيجٌ. (S.)<br>\
مِمْخَضَةٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
مِمْخَاضٌ (assumed tropical:)  A she-camel having a quick flow<br>\
of milk. (JK.)<br>\
مَمْخُوضٌ: see مَخِيضٌ.<br>\
مُسْتَمْخِضٌ Milk slow in becoming thick and fit<br>\
for churning: (K:) or that hardly, if at all,<br>\
becomes so; and when it has become so, is<br>\
churned; and this is the best of the milk of<br>\
ewes or goats, because its butter is destroyed<br>\
(استهلك) in it. (TA.) [But see 10.]<br>\
