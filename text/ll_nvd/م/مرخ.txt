مَرَخَ جَسَدَهُ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
مَرَخَ, (K,) inf. n. مَرْخٌ;<br>\
(S;) and ↓ مرّخهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَمْرِيخٌ; (S;)<br>\
He anointed his body (K) with oil (S, K) &amp;c.<br>\
(K.) And مَرَخَ إِدَاوَتَهُ He smeared with clay his<br>\
إِدَاوَة [or small vessel of skin, for water,] in order<br>\
that its odour might become good. (IAar, TA in<br>\
art. ذرح.)<br>\
2<br>\
مَرَّخَ see 1.<br>\
4<br>\
أَمْرَخَ امرخ He made dough, or paste, thin, (S,<br>\
K,) by putting much water to it. (S.)<br>\
5<br>\
تمرّخ بِالدُّهْنِ He anointed himself with<br>\

مَرْخٌ [a coll. gen. n.] A certain kind of tree<br>\
that quickly emits fire: (S, K:) it is of the kind<br>\
called عِضَاه, and spreads, and grows high, so that<br>\
people rest in its shade: it has neither leaves nor<br>\
thorns, its branches being bare and slender twigs;<br>\
and it grows in [small water-courses such as are<br>\
termed] شُعَب, and in hard grounds: of it are<br>\
made the wooden instruments for producing fire<br>\
which are called زِنَاد: the n. un. is with ة (AHn,<br>\
L) its shade is thin: (L:) there is no tree that<br>\
surpasses the مرخ in yeilding fire: sometimes these<br>\
trees are clustered and tangled together, and the<br>\
wind blowing, and striking one part of them<br>\
against another, they emit fire, and burn the<br>\
valley: Aboo-Ziyád:) [the cynanchum viminale.<br>\
(Spreng. Hist. rei. herb., p. 252: as mentioned<br>\
by Freytag.)] It is said in a proverb, فِى كُلِّ<br>\
شَجَرٍ نَارْ وَاسْتَمْجَدَ المَرْخُ وَالْعَفَارْ [In all trees is<br>\
fire; but the markh and &#39;afár yield much fire]:<br>\
(S:) accord. to AHn, the meaning is, endeavour<br>\
to strike fire with gentleness; for that will be<br>\
sufficient if the زِنَاد be مَرْخ. (L.) See also<br>\
عَفَارٌ, and استمجد. The عفار is the زَنْد, which<br>\
is the upper [piece of the two which compose the<br>\
زَنَاد]; and the مَرْخ is the lower. (S, L.) [See<br>\
also another proverb at the end of art. دفل.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
أَرْخِ يَدَيْكَ وَاسْتَرْخِ إِنَّ الزِّنَادَ مِن مَّرْخِ [Relax thy<br>\
hands, and relax thyself, for the wooden instrument for striking fire is of markh]. A saying<br>\
used with reference to a generous man who requires not to be importuned. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
مَرِخٌ (K) and ↓ مِرِّيخٌ (L) A man who anoints<br>\
himself much, (L, K,) and perfumes himself much.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مَرُوخٌ Oil, &amp;c., with which the body is<br>\
anointed. (K.)<br>\
مِرِّيخٌ: see مَرِخٌ.<br>\
-A2-  A long arrow, having four<br>\
feathers, (S, K,) with which one shoots to the<br>\
utmost distance: (S:) or an arrow which they<br>\
make for lightness, and which they mostly shoot<br>\
to the utmost distance [to measure the ground] for<br>\
the purpose of making horses run when they contend in a race. (Aboo-Ziyád.) ―<br>\
-b2-  المِرِّيخُ, (S K,)<br>\
and مِرِّيخٌ, without ال, which, however, is understood, (IAar,) [The planet Mars]; one of the<br>\
stars called الخُنَّسُ, (S, K,) in the fifth heaven,<br>\
(S,) also called بَهْرَامُ.<br>\
