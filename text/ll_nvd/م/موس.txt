مَاسَ, aor. يَمُوسُ, (Msb,) inf. n. مَوْسٌ, (Sgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) He shaved (Sgh, Msb, K) the head,<br>\
(Sgh, Msb,) or the hair: (K:) but Sgh says,<br>\
that its correctness requires consideration, and<br>\
it was doubted by IF. (TA.) See مُوسَى,<br>\
below.<br>\
المَاسُ, not أَلْمَاسٌ, (K,) i. e., with the disjunctive hemzeh, (TA,) for this is an incorrect pronunciation, (K,) of the vulgar, as Sgh and others<br>\
have plainly asserted; but IAth says, I think<br>\
that the hemzeh and lám in it are radical letters,<br>\
as they are in الياس, [i. e., إِلْيَاس or أَلْيَاس,] and<br>\
it is not Arabic; and if so, its place is under the<br>\
letter hemzeh, because they say أَلْمَاسٌ; but if<br>\
they be [prefixed] for the purpose of rendering<br>\
the word determinate, the present is its [proper]<br>\
place; (TA;) [The diamond;] a certain precious<br>\
stone, (K, * TA,) reckoned among jewels, like the<br>\
يَاقُوت and the زُمُرُّرذ, (TA,) the largest of which<br>\
is like the walnut, (K, TA,) or the egg of the<br>\
pigeon, (TA,) and this is rare, or very rare,<br>\
(K, TA,) the only instance being said to be the<br>\
one called الكَوْكَبُ الدُّرِّىُّ, which is suspended at<br>\
the tomb of the Prophet: (TA:) it breaks all<br>\
stony bodies, and the holding it in the mouth<br>\
breaks the teeth, and fire has no effect upon it,<br>\
nor iron, but only lead breaks it and powders it,<br>\
[a strange mistake, for it is well known that it<br>\
is powdered by being pounded in a steel mortar,]<br>\
after which it is taken [in the state of powder]<br>\
upon drills, and pearls &amp;c. are drilled with it.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
مُوسَى [A razor;] a certain instrument of<br>\
iron, (M, Msb, TA,) with which one shaves:<br>\
(Lth, L, K, TA:) of the measure فُعْلَى, (Ks,<br>\
M, Msb, K,) from المَوْسُ, [inf. n. of مَاسَ,] so<br>\
that the م is a radical letter, (K,) accord. to Lth,<br>\
(TA,) [for] Lth says, (L, TA,) المَوْسُ is the<br>\
root (تَأْسِيس [lit. foundation]) of المُوسَى, (L, K,<br>\
TA,) the thing with which one shaves; (L,<br>\
TA;) therefore, (Az, Msb, K,) it is imperfectly<br>\
decl., because of the short fem. ا [written ى],<br>\
(Msb,) without tenween; (Az, K;) and Fr<br>\
cites a verse [of obscene meaning] in which it is<br>\
made fem.: (TA:) or it is from أَوْسَيْتُ رَأْسَهُ,<br>\
meaning “ I shaved his head,” (ISk, M, * Msb,<br>\
K,) of the measure مُفْعَلٌ, (ISk, Msb, TA,) so<br>\
that the ى is a radical letter, as El-Umawee and<br>\
Yz say, and Aboo-&#39;Amr Ibn-el-Alà inclined to<br>\
think it so, (TA,) and therefore it is perfectly<br>\
decl., (Msb,) with tenween, (Msb, K,) when<br>\
indeterminate; (Msb;) or it is of the measure<br>\
مُفْعَلٌ because this measure is more common than<br>\
فُعْلَى, and because it is perfectly decl. when<br>\
indeterminate, whereas فُعْلَى is not so when<br>\
indeterminate and when determinate: (Ibn-EsSarráj, TA:) but IAmb says, that it is masc.<br>\
and fem., and perfectly decl. and imperfectly<br>\
decl.: ISk says, that the approved way is to<br>\
make it perfectly decl.: (Msb:) [but] he says<br>\
that it is fem. [also, and if so it is imperfectly<br>\
decl.]: (TA:) and it is related of A&#39;Obeyd, in<br>\
the Bári&#39;, that he said he had not heard it<br>\
made masc. except by El-Umawee; (Msb;) who<br>\
asserted it to be masc. only: (TA:) the pl.,<br>\
accord. to him who makes it imperfectly decl.,<br>\
is مُوسَيَاتٌ; and accord. to him who makes it<br>\
perfectly decl., مَوَاسٍ. (Msb.) The dim. of<br>\
موسى, in the sense above explained, [not as a<br>\
proper name, in which case it is مُوسَى only,<br>\
without tenween, and has no relation to the<br>\
same word signifying a razor,] is مُوَيْسِيَةٌ, [but<br>\
by rule it should be مُوَيْسَى, like حُبَيْلَى,] accord.<br>\
to him who says هٰذِهِ مُوسَى; and مُوَيْسٍ accord.<br>\
to him who says هٰذَا مُوسًى. (ISk, TA.)<br>\
