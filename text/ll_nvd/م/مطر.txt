مَطَرَتِ السَّمَآءُ, aor.<br>\
مَطُرَ, inf. n. مَطَرٌ, [The<br>\
sky, or, as it sometimes means, the rain,]<br>\
rained; as also ↓ أَمْطَرَت: (T, S, Msb:) but<br>\
the former is said to relate to that which is sent<br>\
in mercy, and the latter to that which is sent in<br>\
punishment. (Msb.) See also what follows. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Both are also trans. You say,] مَطَرَتْهُمُ السَّمَآءُ,<br>\
(A, K,) aor.<br>\
مَطُرَ, (TA,) inf. n. مَطْرٌ and مَطَرٌ;<br>\
(K:) and ↓ أَمْطَرَتْهُم, (A, TA,) which latter is<br>\
the worse form, [as will be seen below,] The sky<br>\
rained upon them. (A, K, TA.) And مُطِرْنَا We<br>\
were rained upon; we had rain. (S. TA,) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
You say also, مَطَرَهُمْ خَيْرٌ, and شَرٌّ, (tropical:)  [Good,<br>\
and evil, poured upon them; or betided them].<br>\
(A.) And مَطَرَنِى بِخَيْرٍ (tropical:)  He did good to me.<br>\
(K.) And مَا مَطَرَنِى بِخَيْرٍ (tropical:)  [He did not any<br>\

the CK, incorrectly, خَيْرٌ,] and بِخَيْرٍ, (tropical:)  Good<br>\
did not betide him from him, or it. (K, TA.)<br>\
But ↓ أَمْطَرَهُمُ اللّٰهُ is only said in relation to<br>\
punishment: (K, TA:) as in the saying in the<br>\
Kur, [xxvi. 173, and xxvii. 59,] عَلَيْهِمْ ↓ وَأَمْطَرْنَا<br>\
مَطَرًا فَسَآءَ مَطَرُ الْمُنْذَرِينَ (tropical:)  [And we rained upon<br>\
them a rain, and evil was the rain of the<br>\
warned people]: and again in the Kur, [xv. 74,]<br>\
عَلَيْهِمْ حِجَارَةً مِنْ سِجِّيلٍ ↓ وَأَمْطَرْنَا (tropical:)  [And we<br>\
rained upon them stones of baked clay]: the<br>\
stones being regarded as rain because of their<br>\
descent from the sky: some, however, hold that<br>\
مَطَرَ and ↓ أَمَطَرَ are the same in meaning. (TA.)<br>\

the pouring of rain: (A:) or went quickly; or<br>\
hastened; (S;) as also مَطَرَ الفَرَسُ, (K,) aor.<br>\
as above, (TA,) and so the inf. ns.: (K:) or<br>\
this last signifies the horse was quick in his<br>\
passing, or going, and in his running; and so<br>\
↓ تمطّر. (TA.) You say also, بِهِ فَرَسُهُ ↓ تَمَطَّرَ<br>\

quickly, with him. (TA.) And مَطَرَتِ الطَّيْرُ,<br>\

(a man) went away in, or into, the country, or<br>\

and ↓ إِستمطرَ, (Mubtekir, A,) (tropical:)  I spoke to him,<br>\
and he lowered his eyes, looking towards the<br>\
ground, (أَطْرَق, Mubtekir, A, K, [which also<br>\
