load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'مقدمَقَدِىٌّ A certain kind of beverage, prepared<br>\
from honey, (S, L, K,) which the Khaleefehs of<br>\
the sons of Umeyyeh used to drink: (L:) so<br>\
called in relation to a town in Syria, (S, L,) called<br>\
مَقَدٌ; or in relation to a town in Syria in the<br>\
province of El-Urdunn: (L:) or this is a mistake;<br>\
for the name of the town is with teshdeed [مَقَدٌّ]:<br>\
IB says, that the orthography of the word as best<br>\
known to the lexicologists is مَقَدِىٌّ, without<br>\
teshdeed; but that A &#39;Obeyd and others write it<br>\
with teshdeed; and that IAmb cites in confirmation of its being thus a verse of &#39;Amr Ibn-Maadeekerib, at the end of which occurs the expression<br>\
شَغَلُوهُ عَنْ شَرْبِ المَقَدِّ; without ى; [app. for<br>\
مَقَدِّى;] adding, that it is thus called in relation<br>\
to مَقَدٌّ, a town of Damascus, in the mountain<br>\
overlooking El-Ghór: (L:) A &#39;Obeyd says, I<br>\
hold it to be correctly مَقَدِّىٌّ; and I heard Rejà<br>\
Ibn-Selemeh explain this as signifying “ wine<br>\
diminished to half its quantity by boiling; ” as<br>\
though it were divided (قُدَّ) in halves: (Sh, L:)<br>\
IB adds, that Aboo-t-Teyyib the lexicologist says,<br>\
that the word in question is with د without<br>\
teshdeed; from مَقَدٌ; and is only written with<br>\
teshdeed by poetic licence: and in confirmation<br>\
of this assertion, IB cites verses in which the<br>\
name of the town and that of the beverage are<br>\
written without teshdeed. (L.) ―<br>\
