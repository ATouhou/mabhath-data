known, (S in art. ميش, and K,) round, smaller<br>\
than the حِمَّص [or chick-pea], of a tawny colour<br>\
inclining to greenness; it is in Syria and India;<br>\
and is sown; (TA;) also called مَجٌّ and خُلَّرٌ<br>\
and زِنٌّ: (TA, art. مج:) it is of moderate<br>\
temperature; and the mixture made thereof is<br>\
commended, being beneficial to him who is<br>\
fevered, and him who is affected with rheum;<br>\
it is lenitive; and when cooked with vinegar,<br>\
it is beneficial for purulent pustulous mange<br>\
or scab; and an external application thereof<br>\
strengthens feeble limbs: (K:) the word is<br>\
arabicized [from the Persian مَاشْ], or postclassical. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  Utensils and furniture, of the<br>\
meaner sort, of a house or tent. (IAar, K.)<br>\
Hence the saying, المَاشُ خَيْرٌ مِنْ لَاشَ, [in one<br>\
copy of the K I find لَاشٍ, but the former seems<br>\
to be the right reading,] meaning, Mean house-<br>\
hold utensils and furniture are better than<br>\
nothing; or] what is in the house, or tent, of<br>\
worthless utensils and furniture, is better than its<br>\
being empty: (K, TA:) لاش is here contracted<br>\
[from لَاشَىْءَ] for the sake of its resembling ماش.<br>\
(TA.) And خَاشَ مَاشَ and خَاشِ مَاشِ signify<br>\
the same as مَاشٌ thus used: (K, TA in art.<br>\
خوش:) or the refuse, or meanest sort, of people,<br>\
or of mankind; as in the M. (TA.)<br>\
