he drew the مِمْلَقَة [or ملّاسة] over the land, [and<br>\

مَلْث: (TA:) the ملث is the first, or commencement, of the blackness of the west; and the ملس<br>\
is when the blackness has become intense, so that<br>\
the time of the last عِشَآء comes; then the ملس<br>\
becomes confounded with the ملث, and the one<br>\
is not distinguished from the other. (IAar.)<br>\
You say, الظَّلَامِ ↓ أَتَيْتُهُ مَلَسَ, (S, M,) or مَلْسَ الظلام,<br>\
(TA,) I came to him when the darkness had become confused; (S, TA;) when the night had<br>\

عَنَق, [so I render مِعْنَاقٌ,] that outstrips, and is<br>\

journeying. (AZ, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (assumed tropical:)  A man who<br>\
will not remain firm to a compact, covenant,<br>\
engagement, or promise; like as the smooth thing<br>\

hatred, of faults or the like, (El-Ahmar, TA,)<br>\
المَلَسَى لَا عَهْدَ لَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [He who will not remain firm<br>\
to a compact, &amp;c., for him there is no compact,<br>\
&amp;c.]; (El-Ahmar, M;) meaning, that he has<br>\
got out of the affair in safety, there being nothing<br>\
due to him, nor anything to be demanded of him.<br>\
(El-Ahmar, TA.) [But see what here follows.]<br>\

TA;) i. e., (assumed tropical:)  He who steals a commodity, and<br>\
sells it for less than its price, and escapes immediately and hides himself, so that if he who has a<br>\
just claim to it come, he finds his property in the<br>\
hand of him who purchased it, he takes it, and<br>\
the price which the thief gained goes for nought,<br>\
and the purchaser cannot return to him to recover<br>\
the price: (Az, TA:) or it means, (assumed tropical:)  he who goes<br>\
away privily, gets out of the affair in safety, there<br>\
being nothing due to him, nor anything to be<br>\
demanded of him: or املسى means, a (assumed tropical:)  man&#39;s<br>\
selling a commodity which he has stolen, and<br>\
abating the price, and then absenting himself; so<br>\
that when it is plucked from the hand of the purchaser, he cannot sue the seller as responsible for<br>\
the loss thereof: (Msb:) or (tropical:)  the sale to which<br>\
attaches no claim upon the seller for having acted<br>\
unjustly: (A, TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  the selling a thing without making one&#39;s self responsible for any loss or<br>\
the like that may be occasioned by it. (TA.)<br>\
One says, also, in selling, مَلَسَى لَا عُهْدَةَ, meaning,<br>\
that he has escaped from the affair, or become<br>\
quit of it; that there is nothing due to him, nor<br>\
anything to be demanded of him: [i. e., (assumed tropical:)  I am<br>\
quit of the affair: no claim shall be made for<br>\
indemnification.] (S.) You say, also, أَبِيعُكَ<br>\
المَلَسَى لَا عُهْدَةَ, meaning, (tropical:)  [I sell to thee on the<br>\
condition that] thou shalt get thee away, and not<br>\
return to me, (S, Msb, K,) nor have any claim<br>\
upon me for indemnification. (Msb.) [In some<br>\
copies of the S, here and in art. عهد, the verbs by<br>\
which the meaning is explained are of the third<br>\
person, as though referring to the things sold;<br>\
but the right reading I hold to be that which I<br>\
have followed. See also art. عهد.]<br>\
