مَكَسَ, aor.<br>\
مَكِسَ, (TK,) inf. n. مَكْسٌ, (Sh, A, K,)<br>\
He diminished, or deducted from, a thing; (Sh, *<br>\
A, * K, * TK;) syn. of the inf. n. تَقْصٌ. (Sh, A,<br>\
K.) Thus Sh explains مَكْس in the saying of<br>\
Jábir Ibn-Jinnee Et-Taghlibee:<br>\
أَفِى كُلِّ أَسْوَاقِ العِرَاقِ إِتَاوَةٌ<br>\
وَفِى كُلِّ مَا بَاعَ امْرُؤٌ مَكْسُ دِرْهَمِ<br>\
[Is there bribing in every one of the markets of<br>\
El-&#39;Irák, and in the case of everything that a man<br>\
has sold the deducting of a dirhem?]. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence,] you say, مَكَسَ فِى البَيْعِ, aor. and inf. n.<br>\
as above; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) and ↓ ماكس, inf.<br>\
n. مُمَاكَسَةٌ and مِكَاسٌ: (S, Mgh, Msb:) both<br>\
signify He diminished, or deducted from, the price<br>\
in the selling, or buying: (Msb:) or both signify<br>\
he desired, or demanded, a diminution of, or deduction from, the price in selling or buying: (Mgh,<br>\
TA, *) or the former signifies he collected property<br>\
in selling or buying: (K: [but from what I find<br>\
in the other lexicons, I think it probable that an<br>\
early copyist has perverted the text of the K here<br>\
by making a transposition; writing مَكَسَ فِى البَيْعِ<br>\
يَمْكِسُ مَكْسًا جَبَى مَالًا واَلمَكْسُ النَّقْصُ وَالظُّلْمُ for<br>\
مَكَسَ يَمْكِسُ مَكْسًا جَبَى مَالًا وَالمَكْسُ فى البَيْعِ النَّقْصُ<br>\
وَالظُّلْمُ: in the TK we find جنى مالا, which is<br>\
certainly a mistake:]) or مَكْسٌ signifies the<br>\
diminishing (إِنْتِقَاص) of the price of a commodity:<br>\
(M, TA:) and ↓ مِكَاسٌ, the acting with mutual<br>\
niggardliness in bargaining; or, accord. to EshShereeshee, the vying in acuteness between a seller<br>\
and buyer, the former demanding a price and the<br>\
latter offering less, time after time, until they agree<br>\
to a reduced price. (Har, p. 586.) You say also,<br>\
مُكِسَ, meaning, He (a man) suffered a diminution,<br>\
or deduction, in selling or buying and the like.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, perhaps, or the reverse may<br>\
be the case,] He wronged a man; treated him, or<br>\
used him, wrongfully, injuriously, or tyrannically.<br>\
(A, * K, * TK. [In the first and second, only<br>\
the inf. n. of the verb in this sense is mentioned.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, also, app.,] He (the مَكَّاس, Mgh,<br>\
Msb) collected a tax; syn. جَبَى; [particularly,<br>\
the tax termed مَكْس:] (S, * M, Mgh, * Msb [in<br>\
the first and third of which, only the inf. n. of the<br>\
verb in this sense is mentioned:]) or he collected<br>\
property. (A.) Hence the saying, (Mgh,) in a<br>\
trad., (S,) لَا يَدْجُلُ صَاحِبُ مَكْسٍ الجَنَّةَ (S, Mgh)<br>\
[The taker of the tax termed مكس will not enter<br>\
paradise]; meaning, the عَشَّار. (TA.)<br>\

with him [by bidding against him or otherwise]<br>\
in the sale. (MA.) [See, in art. كيس, voce<br>\

thereof.]<br>\
6<br>\

outbidding or otherwise] in the sale. (MA.)<br>\
مَكْسٌ, an inf. n., (see 1,) used as a subst.,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) Money that used to be taken from<br>\
the seller of commodities in the markets in the time<br>\
of ignorance: (IDrd, M, K:) and a dirhem<br>\
which the collector of the poor-rate used to take<br>\
after he had finished the receipt of that tribute:<br>\
(IAar, K:) or what is taken by the عَشَّار, (S,<br>\
Mgh,) or مَاكِس, (S,) or مَكَّاس: (Mgh, Msb:)<br>\
so [accord. to some] in the verse above cited:<br>\
(S:) the tax, or impost, which he used to take:<br>\
(TA:) and generally, what the Sultán&#39;s guards<br>\
take wrongfully on an occasion of buying and<br>\
selling: so [accord. to some] in the verse cited<br>\
