مَخَرَتِ السَّفِينَةُ, (S, A, K,) or مخرت السفينة<br>\
المَآءَ, (TA,) aor.<br>\
مَخَرَ (S, K) and<br>\
مَخُرَ, (S, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
مَخْرٌ and مُخُورٌ, (S, K,) The ship clave the water<br>\
with its stem, and ran: (AHeyth:) or clave<br>\
the water with a noise: (A:) or ran, cleaving<br>\
the water with a noise: (S:) or ran: or faced<br>\
the wind in her course: (K:) or advanced and<br>\
retired. (TA.) And مَخَرَ السَّابِحُ The swimmer<br>\
clave the water with his arms (K, TA.) in<br>\
swimming. (TA.) The primary signification<br>\
of مَخْرٌ is the act of cleaving: and it also<br>\
signifies the making a noise or sound. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تمخّر الرِّيحَ He (a horse) faced the wind,<br>\
(K,) or turned his nose towards the wind, (TA,)<br>\
for the sake of greater ease to himself; as also<br>\
↓ امتخرها, and ↓ استمخرها. (K.) It is mostly<br>\
said of the camel: you say, تمخّرت الإِبِلُ الرِّيحَ<br>\
The camels faced the wind, and snuffed it. (TA.)<br>\
And, met., of a man; as in the following ex.:<br>\
خَرَجْتُ أَتَمَخَّرُ الرِّيحَ, app. meaning, (tropical:)  I went<br>\
forth to snuff the wind. (TA.) You also say,<br>\
الرِّيحَ ↓ إِسْتَمْخَرْتُ (assumed tropical:)  I directed my nose towards<br>\
the wind. (S, A.) And it is said in a trad.,<br>\
إِذَا أَرَادَ أَحَدُكُمُ البَوْلَ فَلْيَتَمَخَّرِ الرِّيحَ (S, K)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  When any one of you desires to make water, let<br>\
him see whence the wind blows, and not face it,<br>\
that it may not drive back the urine against<br>\
him, (S, TA,) and cause it to sprinkle him;<br>\
but let him turn his back to the wind. (TA.)<br>\
And again, (K,) in a trad. of Surákah, as related<br>\
by ISh, on the same subject, (TA,) ↓ إِسْتَمْخِرُوا<br>\
الرِّيحَ, i.e., Turn ye your backs to the wind,<br>\
(K,) in making water; (TA;) as though,<br>\
(كَأَنَّهُ: so in the copies of the K; but in the<br>\
Nh of IAth, لِأَنَّهُ, for, TA) when one turns<br>\
his back to it, he (as it were, TA) cleaves it<br>\
with his back, so that it passes on his right and<br>\
left: for though تَمَخُّرٌ sometimes means the act<br>\
of facing the wind, yet in this trad. it means<br>\
the turning the back: (K:) but this is not<br>\
properly its meaning; for the meaning is, the<br>\
looking to see whence the wind blows: then the<br>\
man is to turn his back. (TA.) You say also<br>\
تمخّرت الإِبِلُ الكَلَأَ The camels turned themselves<br>\
towards the pasture. (L.)<br>\

مَاخُورٌ (tropical:)  The shop of a vintner: so called by<br>\

(K,) meaning “ the ship advanced and retired ”;<br>\
(TA;) because of men&#39;s frequenting it, going to<br>\
