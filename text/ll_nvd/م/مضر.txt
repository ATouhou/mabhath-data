مضّرهُ, inf. n. تَمْضِيرٌ, He referred his lineage,<br>\
or origin, to مُضَر [Mudar, the ancestor of most<br>\
of the Arabs who trace up their genealogy to<br>\
Ismá&#39;eel, or Ishmael]: (K:) or he made him to<br>\
be of the race of مُضَر by referring his lineage,<br>\
or origin, to them. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  It is said, of the<br>\
race of مُضَر, in a trad., مضّرها اللّٰه فِى النَّارِ,<br>\
meaning, May God make them to be in the fire<br>\
[of hell]; the verb being derived from their<br>\
name: (TA:) or may God collect them together<br>\
[therein]; like as one says جَنَّدَ الجُنُودَ: (Z,<br>\
TA:) or destroy them; (K;) from the saying<br>\
ذَهَبَ دَمُهُ خِضْرًا مِضْرًا, in the first of the senses<br>\
explained below: (TA:) J says, [in the S,]<br>\
that its origin seems to be from مُضُورُ اللَّبَنِ,<br>\
meaning “ the biting of the tongue by milk,”<br>\
and that it is with teshdeed to denote muchness,<br>\
or intensiveness. (TA.)<br>\

-b2-  He entered into a league (تَعَصَّبَ, A: in the<br>\
copies of the K, تَغَضَّبَ; but the former, with<br>\
the two unpointed letters, is the right reading:<br>\
TA:) with, (A,) or for, (K,) the race of مُضَر.<br>\
(A, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He affected to be like, or imitated,<br>\
or assimilated himself to, the race of مُضَر. (S,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
ذَهَبَ دَمُهُ خِضْرًا مِضْرًا, (S, A, K,) and خَضِرًا<br>\
↓ مَضِرًا, (K,) His blood went unrevenged, or unretaliated, or unexpiated by a mulct: (S, K:)<br>\
or so as to occasion no inconvenience or trouble<br>\
(هَنِيْئًا مَرِيْئًا) to the slayer: (A:) مضرا is an imitative sequent: Ks mentions also بِضْرًا, with ب.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also, خُذْهُ خِضْرًا مِضْرًا, (K, TA,)<br>\
and ↓ خَضِرًا مَضِرًا, (Sgh, TA, and so in the CK,)<br>\
Take thou it in a fresh, or juicy, state. (K.) See<br>\
also art. خضر.<br>\

مَضِيرَةٌ A kind of cooked food made of [sour]<br>\
milk that bites the tongue: (S:) or a small quantity of broth, or gravy, cooked with milk such as<br>\
is termed مَضِير, and sometimes mixed with fresh<br>\
milk: (K:) or a small quantity of broth, or<br>\
gravy, cooked with milk and other things: (TA:)<br>\
or, as made by the Arabs, flesh-meat cooked with<br>\
pure milk that bites the tongue, until the flesh-meat is thoroughly done, and the milk has become<br>\
thick; and sometimes they mix fresh milk with<br>\
milk that has been collected in a skin; and in this<br>\
case it is the best that can be. (AM, TA.)<br>\
مَاضِرٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ مَضِيرٌ (A, Msb, K)<br>\
and ↓ مَضِرٌ, (IAar, K,) the last thought by ISd<br>\
to be a kind of relative or possessive epithet,<br>\
because the verb is مَضَرَ, (TA,) [but it seems<br>\
that he was unacquainted with, or that he disallowed, the form مَضِرَ, of which it is the regular<br>\
part. n.,] Milk that is sour, or acid, (A, Msb,)<br>\
biting the tongue: (A:) or such as bites the<br>\
tongue, (S, TA,) before becoming رَائِب: (TA:)<br>\
or that has become sour, or acid, and white. (K.)<br>\
