مجّسهُ, (S, A, &amp;c.,) inf. n. تَمْجِيسٌ, (A, K,)<br>\
He made him a مَجُوسِىّ [or Magian]: (S, A,<br>\
Msb, K:) he taught him the religion of the<br>\
مَجُوس. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تمجّس He became a مَجُوسِىّ [or Magian];<br>\
(S, A, K;) he became of the religion of the<br>\
مَجُوس. (Msb.)<br>\
المَجُوسُ [The Magians]; a certain nation:<br>\
it is a Persian word: (Msb:) مَجُوسُ [here<br>\
written in two copies of the S and in the CK<br>\
with tenween, but afterwards shown in the S<br>\
to be imperfectly decl., and expressly said to be<br>\
so in the Msb, art. هود,] is pl. of مَجُوسِىٌّ:<br>\
(S, K:) [or rather the former is a coll. gen. n.,<br>\
and the latter is the n. un.:] the latter is a rel.<br>\
n. from المَجُوسِيَّةُ, q. v., (S,) and is an epithet<br>\
applied to a man: (K:) المَجُوسُ has the article<br>\
ال only because it is used as a pl., (Aboo-&#39;Alee,<br>\
S, M, L,) for المَجُوسِيُّونَ; (ISd, L;) for otherwise مجوس could not receive the art., being of<br>\
itself determinate; and it is also of the fem.<br>\
gender; wherefore, with respect to inflection, it<br>\
is like the قَبِيلَة, not the حَىّ; and the same is<br>\
the case with respect to يَهُودُ; (Aboo-&#39;Alee, S;)<br>\
[i. e.,] each of these two words is imperfectly<br>\
decl. because they mean thereby the قبيلة [so<br>\
called, so that it is a fem. proper name]. (Msb,<br>\
art. هود.) مَجُوسُ was a certain man with small<br>\
ears, who instituted a religion (K) for the<br>\
مَجُوس, (TA,) and invited [them] to it : (K:)<br>\
so says Az: he was not Zarádusht [or Zoroaster]<br>\
the Persian, as some say, because he [Zarádusht]<br>\
was after Abraham, whereas the religion of the<br>\
مجوس is [more] ancient; but Zarádusht revived<br>\
it, and published it, and added to it: (MF:)<br>\
the name is arabicized, from مَنْجَ كُوش, or<br>\
ميج كوش, or مِيخَ كُوش, (as differently written<br>\
in different copies of the K, the first being the<br>\
reading in the TA, and the last being that in<br>\
the CK), the latter of which words signifies<br>\
“ the ear,” [in Persian, but written with ك,] and<br>\
the former meaning “ short. ” (TA.)<br>\
المَجُوسِيَّةُ The religion of the مَجُوس [or<br>\
Magians]. (S, K.) Mohammad said that the<br>\
قَدَرِيَّة were the مَجُوس of his people, because the<br>\
latter believed in two principles, light and darkness, and ascribed good to light and evil to<br>\
darkness, and in like manner the قدريّة ascribed<br>\
good to God, and evil to man and the devil.<br>\
