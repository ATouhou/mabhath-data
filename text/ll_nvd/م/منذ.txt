compound word, as will be explained hereáfter:<br>\
(TA:) Sb says, that it is with respect to time like<br>\
مِنْ with respect to place: (S, L:) it is indecl.,<br>\
[generally] with damm for its termination; and مُذْ<br>\
is indecl. also, [generally] with its final letter quiescent, (S, L, K,) [unless followed by a quiescent<br>\
letter, when it is movent in different manners which<br>\
will be shown below,] and it is formed from مُنْذُ by<br>\
elision: (M, L, K:) منذ is also written and pronounced مِنْذُ, (M, L, K,) in the dial. of the<br>\
Benoo-Suleym; (M, L;) and مذ, مِذْ, (M, L,<br>\
K,) in the dial. of the tribe of &#39;Okl. (M, L.)<br>\
Each may be a prep., governing what follows it<br>\
in the gen. case, and used in the same manner as<br>\
فِى [signifying In, or during, or from the beginning of]: and in this case, each is prefixed only<br>\
to that which denotes present time: thus you say,<br>\
مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذُ اللَّيْلَةِ [I have not seen him in this<br>\
night; or simply I have not seen him this night]:<br>\
(S, L:) or each is followed by a noun in the gen.<br>\
case, and in this instance is a prep., in the sense<br>\
of مِنْ [meaning Since, or lit., from,] when<br>\
relating to a past time [such as a particular past<br>\
day or the like]; and in the sense of فِى [meaning<br>\
In, or from the beginning of,] when relating to<br>\
the present time; and in the sense of مِنْ and إِلَى<br>\
together [meaning From the beginning to the end<br>\
of; or during the whole course of; or simply<br>\
during, or for;] when relating to a computed<br>\
period of time, or number of days or the like: ex.<br>\
[relating to a past time,] مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُنْذُ يَوْمِ الخَمِيسِ<br>\
[I have not seen him since Thursday, إِلَى الْآنَ to<br>\
the present time]; (Mughnee, K;) and [relating<br>\
to the present time,] مُنْذُ يَوْمِنَا or عَامِنَا [in, or<br>\
from the beginning of, (this) our day, or (this)<br>\
our year;]; and, [relating to a computed period of<br>\
time, or number of days or the like,] مُنْذُ ثَلَاثَةِ أَيَّامٍ<br>\
[from the beginning to the end of, i. e., during, or<br>\
for, three days]. (Mughnee.) Each may also<br>\
be a noun, governing the noun which follows it<br>\
in the nom. case, as signifying a particular day<br>\
or the like, or as signifying a definite length of<br>\
time: in the case of a noun signifying a particular<br>\
day or the like, you say, مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْ يَوْمُ الجُمْعَةِ<br>\
[I have not seen him (since the commencement of<br>\
a space of time); the commencement of the space<br>\
of time thereof (i. e., أَوَّلُ مُدَّةِ عَدَمِ رُؤْيَتِى إِيَّاهُ the<br>\
commencement of the space of time of my not seeing<br>\
him) was Friday; meaning, since Friday]: and,<br>\
in the case of a noun signifying a definite length<br>\
of time, you say, مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْ سَنَةٌ, meaning, أَمَدُ<br>\
ذٰلِكَ سَنَةٌ, [I have not seen him (during, or for, a<br>\
time); the time thereof (i. e., أَمَدُ عَدَمِ رُؤْيَتِى إِيَّاهُ<br>\
the time of my not seeing him) is a year; meaning,<br>\
during, or for, a year;] and the noun in this<br>\
latter case can only be indeterminate; for you<br>\
cannot say, مُذْ سَنَةُ كَذَا: (S:) when followed<br>\
by a noun in the nom. case, as in the instance of<br>\
مُنْذُ يَوْمَانِ [or, accord. to more approved usage,<br>\
مُذْ يَوْمَانِ, as will be shown below, The time is<br>\
two days, meaning during, or for, two days], each<br>\
is an inchoative, and what follows it is an enunciative; and its meaning is the time with respect<br>\
to what is present, and to a computed period, or<br>\
a number of days or the like; and the commencement of the space of time with respect to a past<br>\
time [such as a particular past day or the like]:<br>\
or each is an adv. n. [of time], an enunciative, of<br>\
which what follows is the inchoative, and meaning<br>\
بَيْنَ وَبَيْنَ, as in the instance of لَقِيتُهُ مُنْذُ يَوْمَانِ,<br>\
[or, rather, مُذْ يَوْمَانِ,] i. e., بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَ لِقَائِهِ يَوْمَانِ<br>\
[Two days have been between the time in which I<br>\
now am and (the time of) my meeting him]: (K:)<br>\
but this opinion is rejected by Ibn-Hájib. (TA.)<br>\
Accord. to some of the Arabs, for they differ on<br>\
this point, مذ governs in the gen. case a noun<br>\
signifying a past time and one signifying a time<br>\
not past: and accord. to some of them, منذ<br>\
governs in the nom. case a noun signifying a past<br>\
time and one signifying a time not past: (M, L:)<br>\
but the general and most approved way is<br>\
to make مذ govern in the gen. case a noun signifying a time not past, and in the nom. case one<br>\
signifying a time past; and to make منذ govern<br>\
in the gen. case a noun signifying a time not past<br>\
and one signifying a time past: (T, M, L:) most<br>\
of the Arabs hold, that each must govern in the<br>\
gen. case a noun signifying the present time; and<br>\
that it is preferable to make منذ govern in the<br>\
same case, and to make مذ govern in the nom.<br>\
case, a noun signifying a past time: (Mughnee:)<br>\
[they therefore say, مُنْذُ اللَّيْلَةِ and مُذُ اللَّيْلَةِ, and<br>\
مُنْذُ يَوْمِ الخَمِيسِ and مُنْذُ يَوْمَينِ; but they say,<br>\
مُذْ يَوْمُ الخَمِيسِ and مُذْ يَوْمَانِ.] Some [or,<br>\
rather, most] say, لَمْ أَرَهُ مُذْ يَوْمَانِ, and لَمْ أَرَهُ مُنْذُ<br>\
يَوْمَينِ, [I have not seen him for, or during, two<br>\
days;] making مذ [in these instances] to govern<br>\
the nom. case; and منذ, the gen. case. (L.)<br>\
Such is said when the period of separation is a<br>\
day and part of a day. (Msb, art. شهر.) The<br>\
Benoo-Dabbeh and Er-Rabáb make مذ to govern<br>\
the gen. case in every instance. (M, L.) The<br>\
phrases, مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْ عَامٌ أَوَّلُ, and مُذْ عَامٌ أَوَّلَ, (S,<br>\
K, art. وأل; and L,) and مُذْ عَامُ الأَوَّلِ, and مُذْ<br>\
عَامًا أَوَّلَ, [I have not seen him since last year,] are<br>\
also mentioned by different authors. (L.) The<br>\
Arabs generally agree in pronouncing منذ with<br>\
damm to the ذ when it is followed by a movent or<br>\
a quiescent letter; (T, M, L;) as in لَمْ أَرَهُ مُنْذُ يَوْمٍ,<br>\
and مُنْذُ اليَوْمِ: (T, L:) and to pronounce مذ<br>\
with the ذ quiescent when it is followed by a<br>\
movent letter, (T, M, L,) and with damm and<br>\
[sometimes] with kesr when it is followed by a<br>\
conjunctive ا; (M, L;) as in لَمْ أَرَهُ مُذْ يَوْمَانِ,<br>\
and لَمْ أَرَهُ مُذُ اليَوْمِ, [and مُذِ اليَوْمِ]: (T, L:) and<br>\
so say most of the grammarians. (T.) Lh says,<br>\
The Benoo-&#39;Obeyd, of the tribe of Ghanee, make<br>\
the ذ of مذ movent when it is followed by a<br>\
movent or a quiescent letter, and make the noun<br>\
following it to be in the nom. case, saying مُذُ اليَوْمُ;<br>\
and some of them pronounce it with kesr when<br>\
followed by a quiescent letter, saying مُذِ اليَوْمُ;<br>\
but this is not the proper way. (M, L.) In<br>\
the phrase مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذُ اليَوْمِ, the Arabs make the<br>\
ذ movent because of the occurrence [otherwise] of<br>\
two quiescent letters together; and they [generally]<br>\
give it not kesr, but damm, because the latter is<br>\
the final vowel of its original منذ. (M, L.)<br>\
One says also, مَا لَقِيتُةُ مُنْذَ اليَوْمِ, and مُذَ اليَوْمِ,<br>\
which fet-h to the ذ in each. (K.) The Benoo-Suleym are related to have used the expression مَا رَأَيْتُهُ<br>\
مِنْذُ سِتٌّ [by ستّ meaning six nights], with kesr<br>\
to the م of منذ, and with the noun following it in<br>\
the nom. case: and the tribe of &#39;Okl are related<br>\
to have used the expression مِذُ يَوْمَانِ, with the<br>\
ن elided, and with kesr to the م, and damm to<br>\
the ذ. (M, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Each of the two words منذ<br>\
and مذ is also followed by a verbal proposition,<br>\
as in the instance<br>\
مَا زَالَ مُذْ عَقَدَتْ يَدَاهُ إِزَازَهُ<br>\
[He has not ceased, since his two hands tied his<br>\
wrapper of the lower part of the body]: or a<br>\
nominal proposition, as in the instance<br>\
وَلَا زِلْتُ أَبْغِى المَالَ مُذْ أَنَا يَافِعٌ<br>\
[And I ceased not to seek wealth from the time<br>\
of my being a youth, or young man]: in such<br>\
cases, each is an adv. n. prefixed to the proposition<br>\
[and governing it virtually in the gen. case], or<br>\
to a noun significant of time [understood as] prefixed thereto [in the same manner]: or, as some<br>\
say, each is an inchoative. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The original<br>\
of مذ is منذ, because they restore the dammeh<br>\
to the ذ in the case of the occurrence of two<br>\
quiescent letters together; as in the instance of<br>\
مُذُ اليَوْمِ, for were not its original with damm,<br>\
they would give it kesr: [but this some do, as<br>\
has been shown above:] and because its dim. is<br>\
مُنَيْذٌ: (K:) for when مذ is used as a proper<br>\
name of a man, its dim. is thus formed, by restoring the ن, that it may be of the measure<br>\
فُعَيْلٌ: (IJ, M, L:) or when مذ is a noun, it is<br>\
originally منذ; and when it is a particle, it is<br>\
itself original. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Accord. to some, منذ<br>\
(T, S, L, K) and مذ (K) are originally مِنْ and إِذْ,<br>\
which are made one word, (T, S, L, K,) by<br>\
eliding the hemzeh, and then giving damm to the<br>\
ذ because of the occurrence of two quiescent letters<br>\
together; (K;) مُنْذُ كَانَ [and مُذْ كَانَ] meaning<br>\
مِنْ إِذْ كَانَ: (T, L:) but there is nothing to<br>\
indicate the truth of this opinion: (S, L:) or, as<br>\
some say, منذ and مذ are originally the prep.<br>\
من and ذو in the sense of الَّذِى (L, K) in the<br>\
dial. of Teiyi: so says Fr.; adding, that when<br>\
either governs a gen. case, it is used in the manner<br>\
of مَنْ; and when it governs a nom. case, it is<br>\
as though one said, [in using the expression<br>\
مُنْذُ أَوْ مُذْ يَوْمَانِ,] مِنَ الَّذِى هُوَ يَوْمَانِ; and that<br>\
the former government prevails in the case of منذ<br>\
because the ن is not suppressed: (L:) or, as<br>\
some say, they are originally مِنْ and the noun of<br>\
indication ذَا; so that in the phrase مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُنْذُ<br>\
يَوْمَانِ, [accord. to more approved usage, مُذْ يَوْمَانِ,]<br>\
we virtually say, مِنْ ذَا الْوَقْتِ يَوْمَانِ: but each<br>\
of these assertions is a deviation from the plain<br>\
way. (K.)<br>\
