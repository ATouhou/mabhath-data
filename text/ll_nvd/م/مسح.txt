مَسَحَ شَيْئًا, aor.<br>\
مَسَحَ, inf. n. مَسْحٌ; and ↓ مسّحهُ,<br>\
inf. n تَمْسِيحٌ; He wiped a thing that was wet<br>\
or dirty, with his hand, or passed his hand over<br>\
it to remove the wet or dirt that was upon it:<br>\
(L:) مَسْحٌ and تَمْسِيحٌ and ↓ تَمَسُّحٌ signifying<br>\
the passing the hand over a thing that is flowing<br>\
[with water or the like], or dirtied, soiled, or<br>\
polluted, to remove the fluid or dirt, or soil or<br>\
pollution; (L, K;) as when one wipes his head<br>\
with his hand to remove water; and his forehead, to remove sweat. (L.) [It often signifies<br>\
He stroked a thing with his hand; as, for<br>\
instance, the Black Stone of the Kaabeh; see<br>\
below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  مَسَحَ رَأْسَهُ مِنَ المَآءِ; and جَبِينَهُ<br>\

(S) He wiped with his hand, or passed his hand<br>\
closely over, his head, or a part thereof, without<br>\
making any water to flow upon it: so in the<br>\
Kur, v. 8; where it is said, فَاغْسِلُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ<br>\
وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ إِلَى الْمَرَافِقِ وَامْسَحُوا بِرُؤُوسِكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ<br>\
إِلَى الْكَعْبَيْنِ: here أَرْجُلَكُمْ is in the acc. case as<br>\
an adjunct to ايديكم; [i.e., as a third objective<br>\
complement to the verb اغسلوا; not as an adjunct<br>\
to رؤوسكم;] but some read أَرْجُلِكُمْ, putting it in<br>\
the gen. case because of its proximity to رؤوسكم;<br>\
(Jel;) [in like manner as خَرِبٍ is put in the gen.<br>\
case in the phrase هٰذَا جُحْرُ ضَبٍّ خَرِبٍ, an ex.<br>\
given by many of the grammarians, showing<br>\
that this is allowable in prose,] notwithstanding<br>\
that it is said, by Aboo-Is-hák the grammarian,<br>\
that the putting a noun in the gen. case because<br>\
of its proximity to a preceding noun in that case<br>\
is not allowable except in poetry, when necessity<br>\
requires it: (L:) the head, which is wiped, is<br>\
mentioned between the arms and the feet, which<br>\
are washed, to show the order which is to be<br>\
observed in the purification. (Jel.) But مَسَحَ<br>\
signifies both he wiped with the hand, and also<br>\
he washed: so says IAth: (L:) and AZ and<br>\
IKt say the like: (Msb:) you say مَسَحْتُ يَدَىَّ<br>\
بالمَآءِ, meaning I washed my hands with water.<br>\
(AZ, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  مَسَحَ شَيْئًا بِالمَآءِ He wiped a thing<br>\
with his hand wetted with water; passed his<br>\
hand, wetted with water, over a thing. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  مَسَحَ البَيْت He compassed the House [of<br>\
God, i.e. the Kaabeh: because he who does so<br>\
passes his hand over the corner in which is the<br>\
Black Stone]. (L.) ―<br>\
-b6-  مَسَحَ اللّٰهُ عَنْكَ مَا بِكَ May<br>\
God remove that which is in thee! (L;) or, wash<br>\
and cleanse thee from thy sins! (TA, art. مصح.)<br>\
