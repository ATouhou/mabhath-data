مَغڤصَ [مَغَصَهُ, inf. n. مَغْصٌ, He pierced him with a<br>\
spear or the like: for] مَغْصٌ is syn. with طَعْنٌ;<br>\
as also مَغْسٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [Hence, perhaps,] مُغِصَ,<br>\
(ISk, S, Msb, K,) [of which مَغْصٌ, which see<br>\
below, is app. the inf. n.] and مَغِصَ, (A, Msb,<br>\
[in a copy of the former of which, instead of the<br>\
former verb, I find مَغُصَ, but this is probably a<br>\
mistranscription,]) inf. n. مَغَصٌ; (Msb;) He (a<br>\
man, S, Msb,) had what is termed مَغْصٌ as<br>\
explained below; (ISk, S, A, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
مُغِسَ and مَغِسَ: (IKoot, Msb:) and مَعِصَ:<br>\
(TA:) [it is most commonly with غ and ص;<br>\
but Z says, that] the original word is with س,<br>\
from مَغَسَهُ signifying طَعَنَهُ. (A.)<br>\
5<br>\
تمغّص بَطْنِى, and تَمَغَّصَنِى, My belly pained<br>\
me; as also تمغّس, with س. (TA.) [In the<br>\
CK, we find تمغّص بَطْنَهُ, explained by أَوْجَعَهُ,<br>\
as though signifying It pained his belly: but<br>\
بَطْنَهُ is doubtless a mistake for بَطْنُهُ. In MS.<br>\
copies of the K, I do not find this verb.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[hence,] تَمَغَّصَنِى الشَّىْءُ (assumed tropical:)  The thing hurt me:<br>\
and in like manner, تَمَغَّصْتُ مِنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  [I was hurt<br>\
by it]. (TA.)<br>\
مَغْصٌ (ISk, S, A, Msb, K) and مَغَصٌ; (IDr,<br>\
A, K;) but the former is the chaste word;<br>\
(A;) or the latter, accord. to ISk, is vulgar,<br>\
(S,) and Az pronounces him right in saying so,<br>\
(Msb,) and Yaakoob disallows the latter word.<br>\
wherefore the author of the K is wrong in imputing error, in this matter, [if error it be,] to J;<br>\
(TA;) [Colic; or] pain in the belly, (A, K,)<br>\
and griping (تَقْطِيعٌ) in the bowels; (A;) or<br>\
griping (تقطيع) in the bowels, and pain [therein];<br>\
(S;) or pain in the bowels, and contortion [therein]; (Msb;) as also مَغْسٌ. (Yaakoob, TA.)<br>\
مَمْغُوصٌ A man (S, Msb) having what is<br>\
termed مَغْصٌ as explained above. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
