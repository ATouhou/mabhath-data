A, K,) (tropical:)  I ate with such a one. (S, A, K.)<br>\
Abu-l-Kásim Er-Zejjájee disapproves of this,<br>\
saying that a verb of this form is only derived<br>\
from an inf. n., as in the cases of ضَارَبَ and<br>\
قَاتَلَ; whereas this is derived from مِلْحٌ, a subst.<br>\
[But his objection seems to me invalid: this<br>\
may be an anomalous instance, and yet of classical authority, like many others.] ―<br>\
-b2-  مَالَحَهُ,<br>\
inf. n. مُمَالَحَةٌ and مِلَاحٌ, (tropical:)  He was, or became,<br>\
his foster-brother. (L, TA.) [المِلَاحُ is explained in the K by المُرَاضَعَةُ: Lth explaines<br>\
it by الرَّضَاعُ, as is mentioned in the TA: المُمَالَحَةُ<br>\
is explained in the A, Mgh, L, and other lexicons<br>\
by المُرَاضَعَةُ: in the copies of the K in my<br>\
hands, by الرَّضَاعُ; and so in one copy of the S:<br>\
in another copy of the S written الرِّضَاعُ; and in<br>\
another الرّضَاع, without any vowel to the ر:<br>\
الرضَاعُ, syn. with المُرَاضَعَةُ, is evidently the<br>\
right reading.] Abu-l-Kásim Er-Zejjájee disapproves of the verb used as signifying the<br>\
act of two men&#39;s sucking each other; [but this<br>\
is not what is meant by المراضعة;] and pronounces it a post-classical word. (TA.) You<br>\
say بَيْنَهُمَا حُرْمَةُ المُمَالَحَةِ Between them two is<br>\
the sacred or inviolable bond, or obligation,<br>\
which is the consequence of their being fosterbrothers. (A.)<br>\

أَمْلَحَ See 1, in four places, and 2. ―<br>\
-b2-  املح<br>\

-b2-  املحت الإِبِلُ The<br>\

-b3-<br>\
مَا أَمَيْلِحَ زَيْدًا (tropical:)  [How very goodly, or beautiful,<br>\
or pretty, is Zeyd! a diminutive form, meant<br>\
to denote the contrary of the sense of a dim.,<br>\
being what is termed تَصْغِيرُ تَعْظِيمٍ, from<br>\
مَا أَمْلَحَهُ:] (T, S, K:) the verb is here put<br>\
into the dim. form, being meant to be used as<br>\
an epithet, as though they said مُلَيْحٌ: (T:)<br>\
it is the only instance of a verb put into this<br>\
form, except مَا أُحَيْسِنَهُ, (S, K,) and, as some<br>\
say, مَا أُحَيْلَاهُ. (TA.) This is said accord. to<br>\
the doctrine of the Basrees, who assert the افعل<br>\
of wonder to be a verb: but as to the Koofees,<br>\
who say that it is a noun, [meaning an epithet,]<br>\
they allow the formation of the dim. from it<br>\
without restriction; and from its admitting the<br>\
dim. form, they argue that it is a noun. (MF.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  مَا أَمْلَحَ وَجْهَهُ, and فِعْلَهُ, (tropical:)  How goodly,<br>\
beautiful, or pretty, is his face! and how good<br>\
is his action! (A.) ―<br>\

10<br>\
استملحهُ (assumed tropical:)  He esteemed him, or it, goodly,<br>\

sucking the mother or any nurse; syn. رَضَاعٌ; (S,<br>\

-b2-  مِلْحٌ (tropical:)  Milk. (IAar.)<br>\
The following verse of Abu-t-Tamahán, who had<br>\
some camels, of the milk whereof he gave to drink<br>\
to a people that afterwards made an attack upon<br>\
them, and took them, is cited by As, [app., accord.<br>\
to the S, as an ex. of ملح in the sense of رَضَاع;<br>\
but as MF observes, it may be taken as an ex. of<br>\
that word in the sense of milk;]<br>\
وِإِنِّى لَأَرْجُو مِلْحَهَا فِى بُطُونِكُمْ<br>\
وَمَا بَسَطَتْ مِنْ جِلدِ أَشْعَثَ أَغْبَرَا<br>\
(S, L.) The poet says, Verily I hope that ye<br>\
may regard (أَنْ تَرْعَوْا [which is understood]) the<br>\
milk which ye have drank, of these camels, [lit.,<br>\
their milk in your bellies,] and the skins which<br>\
they have expanded, of a people with matted and<br>\
dusty hair, and of a dusty hue; as though their<br>\
skins had dried up, and they had fattened upon<br>\
them. [Another explanation will be noticed<br>\
below.] IB says, that the last word should be<br>\
read أَغْبَرِ, for the sake of the rhyme; for each<br>\
verse of the poem to which it belongs ends with<br>\
kesreh. (L.)<br>\
-A2-  مِلْحٌ a thing well known, (S,<br>\
K,) [Salt;] that with which food is made pleasant:<br>\
(L:) of the fem. gender (Z) generally; (O;)<br>\
sometimes masc.: (K:) pl. مِلَاحٌ. (Msb.) Dim.<br>\
مُلَيْحَةٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَآءٌ مِلْحٌ, (S, K, &amp;c.,) originally ↓ مَلِحْ, from the verb مَلُحَ, like خَشِنٌ from<br>\
خَشُنَ, contracted because of the frequency of its<br>\
usage; (Msb;) and ↓ ماء مَلِيحٌ, (K,) and ↓ مَالِحٌ;<br>\
(IAar, ADk, Az;) [respecting which last, see<br>\
what will be found after the explanation;] Salt<br>\
water. (S, K, &amp;c.) J says, that مَاء مالح is not<br>\
allowable, except in a bad dial.: but Az says,<br>\
that, though rarely found in the language of the<br>\
Arabs, it is not to be rejected; and IB says, that<br>\
it occurs in verses of chaste poets; and may be<br>\
considered as used after the manner of a rel. n.,<br>\
[meaning ذُو مِلْحٍ,] like رَجُلٌ تَارِسٌ, i. e. ذُو تُرْسٍ,<br>\
and دَارِعٌ, i. e. ذُو دِرْعٍ: (TA:) it is a chaste word,<br>\
of the dial. of El-Hijáz, but extr., being from<br>\
أَمْلَحَ المَآءُ, like as you say بَاقِلٌ from أَبْقَلَ المَوْضِعُ;<br>\
and when it is said that it is rare, it is meant that<br>\
it is not agreeable with its verb, not that it is rare<br>\
with respect to usage, seeing that it is of the dial.<br>\
of the people of El-Hijáz, who selected the most<br>\
chaste words of the various dialects: or it is<br>\
regularly formed from مَلَحَ المَأءُ, a form of the<br>\
verb sometimes used. (Msb.) The pl. of مِلْحٌ is<br>\
مِلْحَةٌ and مِلَاحٌ and مِلَحٌ: (L, K:) and sometimes is said أَمْوَاهٌ مِلْحٌ salt waters; and رَكِيَّةٌ مِلْحَةٌ<br>\
a salt well. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  مِلَاحٌ Salt waters. (T, K.)<br>\
↓ قَلِيبٌ مَليِحٌ A well of salt water: (S, K:) pl.<br>\
أَقْلِبَةٌ مِلَاحٌ, occurring in a verse of &#39;Antarah. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  مِلْحٌ (assumed tropical:)  Knowledge; science; learning; syn.<br>\
عِلْمٌ. (IKh, Kz, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  Men of science; learned<br>\
men; syn. عُلَمَآءُ. (IKh, Kz, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  (tropical:)  Goodliness,<br>\
or beauty. (K.) [Accord. to the TA, it is an<br>\
inf. n.: see مَلُحَ.] ―<br>\
-b7-  (tropical:)  Fat, as a subst. (Sh, K.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
(tropical:)  Fatness: (K:) or a small degree of fatness. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b9-  مِلْحٌ and ↓ مِلْحَةٌ (tropical:)  A sacred or inviolable<br>\
bond, or the like, or any compact, bond, or obligation, which one is under an obligation to respect,<br>\
or honour, or the cancelling or breaking of which<br>\
renders one obnoxious to blame; syn. حُرْمَةٌ and<br>\
ذِمَامٌ; and a compact, or confederacy; syn. حِلْفٌ.<br>\
(K.) In some copies of the K, for حِلْفٌ is put<br>\
حَلفٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  Accord. to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, this<br>\
is the signification of the former word in the verse<br>\
of Abu-t-Tamahán cited above, and the poet<br>\
means, I hope that God may punish you for your<br>\
perfidious violation of the sacred obligation to<br>\
their owner, which they imposed upon you. You<br>\
say بَيْنَ فُلَانٍ وَفُلَانٍ مِلْحٌ, and ↓ مِلْحَةٌ, There is<br>\
a sacred or inviolable bond, &amp;c., between such<br>\
a one and such a one. [This meaning is<br>\
derived from مِلْحٌ as signifying “ salt; ” the<br>\
eating of which with another imposes upon the<br>\
two parties a sacred mutual obligation.] The<br>\
Arabs, says Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, pay a high respect<br>\
to salt and fire and ashes. (L.) [You say,]<br>\
مِلْحُهُ عَلَى رُكْبَتِهِ, so in the copies of the K,<br>\
but correctly على رُكْبَتَيْهِ, as in all the other<br>\
lexicons, (TA,) (tropical:)  [lit., His salt is upon his knees;]<br>\
meaning he has no good faith, so as to fulfil his<br>\
promises, or engagements: (K:) or he has little<br>\
good faith, so as to fulfil his promises, &amp;c., for the<br>\
Arabs swear by salt, and by water, because of<br>\
their respect for them: (IAar:) or he violates the<br>\
obligation imposed by such, the smallest thing<br>\
making him forget it, like as the least thing<br>\
scatters salt if a person puts it upon his knees:<br>\
(T:) or he is fat: (K:) As says, that in the<br>\
following verse,<br>\
لَا تَلُمْهَا إِنَّهَا مِنْ نِسْوَةٍ<br>\
مِلْحُهَا مَوْضُوعَةٌ فَوْقَ الرُّكَبْ<br>\
[Blame her not; for she is of women whose fat is<br>\
placed above the knees;] the woman meant was<br>\
of the people called Ez-Zenj, whose fat is in their<br>\
thighs, and ملحها signifies their fat: (TA:) or<br>\
he is sharp in his anger: (K:) or he is of evil<br>\
disposition, rendered angry by the least thing;<br>\
like as salt upon the knee is scattered by the least<br>\
thing: (T:) or he is frequently engaged in altercation; as though his knees were much wounded<br>\
by his long kneeling in altercation, and by his<br>\
long striking his knees against those of another,<br>\
and he therefore put salt upon them to cure them.<br>\
(A.) [See also رُكْبَةٌ.]<br>\
-A3-  نَبْتٌ مِلْحٌ, and ↓ مَالِحٌ,<br>\
A plant of the kind called حَمْضٌ. (ISk, S.)<br>\

-b2-  A certain disease and fault<br>\
in the kind leg of a beast of carriage; (TA;) a<br>\
swelling in the hock, or hock-tendon, (عُرْقُوب,) of<br>\
a horse; (S, K;) less than what is called جَرَذٌ;<br>\
which is a name given to it when it has become<br>\
violent. (S.)<br>\
مَلِحٌ: see مِلْحٌ.<br>\
مَلْحَةٌ (tropical:)  A single feed taken by a child from the<br>\
breast. مَلْجَةٌ, with ج, signifies a single suck.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  مَلْحَةٌ The main body of the sea; or<br>\
the fathomless deep of the sea; or a great expanse<br>\
of sea of which the extremities cannot be seen.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
مُلْحَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ مَلَحٌ (K) (tropical:)  A white colour<br>\
intermixed with black: (S, K:) whiteness overspreading blackness in the human hair, and in<br>\
anything: or a dusty white colour: or a clear<br>\
white colour: or whiteness inclining to any kind<br>\
of redness; like the colour of the antelope. (L.)<br>\
[See also أَمْلَحُ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, مُلْحَةٌ (tropical:)  The utmost<br>\
degree of blueness or grayness, [app. meaning the<br>\
latter, from مِلْحٌ as signifying “ salt,” as salt in<br>\
the state in which it is commonly used in Arabia<br>\
is of a pale gray colour,] أَشَدُّ الزَّرقِ: (K:) or<br>\
blueness, or grayness, (زُرْقَة,) of such a degree as<br>\
to incline to whiteness. (S.) [See أَمْلَحُ.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
مُلْحَةٌ (tropical:)  A goodly, beautiful, pretty, or facetious,<br>\
story, or narrative, and word, or saying, or speech;<br>\
a bon-mot; (L;) وَاحِدَةُ المُلَحِ مِنَ الأَحَادِيثِ;<br>\
(S, K;) [what is deemed beautiful, elegant, facetious, or the like, of stories, &amp;c.: (Ibr D:) and<br>\
so ↓ أُمْلُوحَةٌ, coupled with أُفْكُوهَةٌ in art. فكه in<br>\
the TA:] also said to signify a bad, an abominable, or a foul, word, saying, or speech; a meaning<br>\
taken from a trad. of &#39;Áïsheh, who applied this<br>\
term [perhaps ironically] to a bad answer which<br>\
she had given in consequence of her having misunderstood a question put to her: (L:) pl. مُلَحٌ.<br>\
(S, K.) As said نِلْتُ بِالمُلَحِ [I have attained<br>\
to the station, or rank, to which I have attained<br>\
by means of goodly, or facetious, sayings, &amp;c.]<br>\
(S.) حَدَّثْتُهُ بِالمُلَحِ (tropical:)  [I related to him goodly,<br>\
beautiful, pretty, or facetious, stories.] (A.) ―<br>\

these ways in a copy of the S in my hands,] (tropical:)  A<br>\

of the whiteness of its snow: (S:) the month<br>\
called Jumáda-l-Ákhireh, جُمَادَى الآخِرَةٌ, (K,)<br>\
[in the old Arabian calendar;] because of its<br>\
whiteness; Jumáda-l-Oolà, جُمَادَى الأُولَى, being<br>\
called شِيبَانُ: or this was a name of Kánoon el-Owwal, كَانُونُ الأَوَّلُ; (TA;) and مِلْحَانُ was<br>\
Kánoon eth-Thánee, كَانُونُ الثَّانِى: (K, TA:)<br>\
[but see شِيبَانُ:] or شِيبَانُ and مِلْحَانُ were names<br>\
applied to the days when the earth was white with<br>\
hoar-frost, or rime. (&#39;Amr Ibn-Abee-&#39;Amr, Az.)<br>\
مُلَاحٌ: see مَلِيحٌ.<br>\
