مَدَحَهُ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
مَدَحَ, (K,) inf. n. مَدْحٌ<br>\
(S, K) and مِدْحَةٌ, (K,) as some say, but<br>\
correctly this latter is a simple subst.; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓ امتدحهُ; (S, K;) and ↓ مدّحهُ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. تَمْدِيح; (TA;) [but this, and that next<br>\
preceding it, have an intensive signification, as<br>\
is shown by the explanation of their pass. part.<br>\
ns., which see below;] and ↓ تمدّحهُ; (K:)<br>\
[which seems to imply some degree of effort in<br>\
the agent;] He praised, eulogized, or commended,<br>\
him; spoke well of him; mentioned him with approbation: (S, K:) or he described him as<br>\
characterized by goodliness, beauty, or elegance;<br>\
opposite of ذَمَّهُ: and he enumerated his generous<br>\
qualities or actions; opposite of هَجَاهُ: (MF:)<br>\
or he praised him for his goodly qualities, whether<br>\
natural or depending upon his own will; and<br>\
hence it is of more common application than<br>\
حَمَدَهُ: accord. to El-Khateeb El-Tebreezee, it<br>\
is from the phrase تَمَدَّحَتِ الأَرْضُ “ the land became ample, or spacious; ” whence it would<br>\
seem to signify he amplified his phrase: accord.<br>\
to Kh, مَدَحَهُ relates to an absent person; and<br>\
مَدَهَهُ, to one who is present: and accord. to EsSarakustee, مَدْهٌ is descriptive of the state, or<br>\
condition, and external appearance or form; and<br>\
of nothing beside. (Msb.)<br>\

(K,) The hypochondre, or flank, became distended,<br>\
expanded, or dilated, (S, K,) by reason of<br>\
satiety; like تندّحت: occurring in this sense<br>\
in a verse of Er-Rá&#39;ee, as some relate it; as<br>\
others relate it, it is تمذّحت. (S.) ―<br>\
-b7-  بَطْنُهُ ↓ امدحّ<br>\
His belly became wide, or distended; a dial. form<br>\
of اندحّ. (S.) This, says F, is a mistake; but<br>\
it is no mistake; and he has perverted the words<br>\
of J, which are confirmed by Sgh and the author<br>\
of the L and many others. (MF.) ―<br>\
