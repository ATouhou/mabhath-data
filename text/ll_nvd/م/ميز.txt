مَازَهُ, aor. يَمِيزُهُ, inf. n. مَيْزٌ; (S, A, Msb,<br>\
K;) and ↓ ميّزهُ (S, K,) inf. n. تَمْيِيزٌ; (S;) or<br>\
the latter has an intensive signification; (Msb;)<br>\
He put it, or set it, apart, away, or aside;<br>\
removed it; or separated it; (S, A, Msb, K;)<br>\
from another thing, or other things; (Msb;) as<br>\
also ↓ امازهُ: (K:) [or the second, rather, he did<br>\
so much, or greatly, or widely; like زَيَّلَهُ.] You<br>\
say, مَازَهُ مِنْهُ, and ↓ ميّزهُ. (A.) Ex. مَازَ الأَذَى<br>\
مِنَ الطَّرِّيق He put aside, or removed, what<br>\
was hurtful from the road. (TA.) And it is<br>\
said in the Kur, [viii. 38,] لِيَمِيزَ اللّٰهُ الخَبِيثَ<br>\
مِنَ الطَّيِّبِ [That God may separate, or sever,<br>\
the evil from the good]. (Msb.) [It seems also,<br>\
from what is said in the A, that مَايَزْتُ بَيْنَهُمَا<br>\
signifies I separated them two: besides having<br>\
another signification, which see below.] You<br>\
say also مَازَ الشَّىْءَ, (aor. and inf. n. as above,<br>\
TA,) meaning, He separated one part of the<br>\
thing from another; فَصَلَ بَعْضَهُ مِنْ بَعْضٍ, (M,<br>\
TA,) or عَنْ بَعْضٍ: (as in a copy of the A:)<br>\
expl. in the K as signifying فَضَّلَ بَعْضَهُ عَلَى بَعْضٍ<br>\
[he judged, or made, part of the thing to excel,<br>\
or to have excelled, another]; but the explanation<br>\
in the M is the right. (TA.) And الأَشْيَآءَ ↓ ميّز<br>\
He separated the things after knowledge of them.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, He distinguished it, or discriminated it, or discerned it. And مَازَ بَيْنَ<br>\
الأَشْيَآءِ, and بَيْنَهَا ↓ مَيَّزَ, He distinguished, or discriminated, or discerned, between the things.<br>\
This is what is meant by its being said,] المَيْزُ<br>\
also signifies التَّمْيِيزُ بَيْنَ الأَشْيَآءِ. (TA.) You say<br>\
also, بَيْنَهُمَا ↓ مَايَزْتُ [I distinguished, or discriminated, or discerned, between them two]. (A.)<br>\
From ميّز الاشيآء, meaning as explained above,<br>\
is [also], app., derived the phrase سِنُّ التَّمْيِيزِ, used<br>\
by the doctors of practical law, as signifying,<br>\
[The age of discrimination;] the age at which<br>\
one knows what things are beneficial to him and<br>\
what are hurtful to him: or, accord. to some,<br>\
التَّمْيِيز is a faculty in the brain whereby meanings<br>\
are elicited. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  مَازَ [is also intrans.,<br>\
and signifies] He (a man) removed from one<br>\
place to another. (IAar, K.) See also 8.<br>\

امتاز, and ↓ تميّز, (S, A, Msb, K,) and<br>\
↓ انماز. (S, A, K,) and ↓ إِمَّازَ, (Lh, TA,) [the<br>\
last being a variation of that immediately preceding,] and ↓ استماز, (S, A, K,) It was, or<br>\
became, put, or set, apart, away, or aside; or<br>\
removed; or separated; (S, A, * Msb, * K;)<br>\
from another thing, or other things: (Msb:)<br>\
and the last, ↓ استماز, he went, or withdrew,<br>\
aside, or to a distance, (K, TA,) عَنِ الشَّىْءِ<br>\
from the thing. (TA.) All these forms are<br>\
syn.; but in the phrase مِزْتُهُ فَلَمْ يَمَّزْ [as though<br>\
signifying I put it, or set it, apart, &amp;c., but it<br>\
did not remain so] Lh allows the verbs to be<br>\
only in these two forms: (TA:) [though ↓ انماز<br>\
is used in other cases; for] you say عَنْ ↓ انماز<br>\
مُصَلَّاهُ He shifted from his place of prayer; or<br>\
quitted it for another. (TA.) [See also 1, last<br>\
signification.] You say also, امتار القَوْمُ, meaning, بَعْضُهُمْ مِنْ بَعْضٍ ↓ تميّز [The people were,<br>\
or became, put, or set, apart, &amp;c., one from<br>\
another]: (S, TA:) and, as also ↓ تميّزوا, they<br>\
became on one side: or they became alone, or<br>\
separate: and the former, they withdrew, in a<br>\
company or troop, aside; as also ↓ استمازوا:<br>\
(TA:) and [in like manner] ↓ تمايزوا they became<br>\
separated: (A:) and they formed themselves into<br>\
separate companies, or troops, and went away,<br>\
one from another. (TA. [التَّمَايُزُ being there<br>\
said to signify التَّحَزُّبُ وَالتَّنَافُرُ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [امتاز, and<br>\
the other forms mentioned above, in the first<br>\
sentence of the paragraph, as syn. with it, also<br>\
signify It was, or became, distinguished, or discriminated, or discerned: in which sense, ↓ تميّز<br>\
is the most common. You say also, فُلَانٌ ↓ تميّز<br>\
بِالْكَرَمِ Such a one was, or became, distinguished<br>\
by generosity. And الأَشْيَآءُ ↓ تَمَايَزَتِ and ↓ تُمَيَّزَت<br>\
The things were, or became, distinguished, or discriminated, one from another; or distinct.]<br>\
