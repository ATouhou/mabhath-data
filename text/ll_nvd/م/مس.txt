مَسَّهُ, (A, Mgh,) first pers. مَسِسْتُهُ, (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K,) for which they sometimes say مِسْتُهُ,<br>\
rejecting the first س, (Sb, * S, M, * K,) and transferring the kesreh thereof to the م (Sb, * S, M, *)<br>\
contr. to general rule, (Sb, M,) and some do not<br>\
transfer the kesreh, but leave the م with its<br>\
fethah, [saying مَسْتُهُ,] like ظِلْتُمْ and ظَلْتُمْ for<br>\
ظَلِلْتُمْ, an irregular contraction, (S,) aor. يَمَسُّهُ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) [and يَمْسَسْهُ when mejzoom, accord.<br>\
to rule,] inf. n. مَسٌّ (S, M, A, Msb, K) and<br>\
مَسِيسٌ, (S, * M, A, K,) or the latter is a simple<br>\
subst., (Msb,) and مِسِّيسَى; (S, * K;) and [مَسَّهُ,]<br>\
first pers. مَسَسْتُهُ; aor. يَمُسُّهُ, (AO, S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. مَسٌّ; (Msb;) the former of which two<br>\
verbs is the more chaste; (S, TA;) He touched<br>\
it, or felt it, [generally the former,] syn. لَمَسَهُ,<br>\
(M, A, K,) with his hand: (TA: as from the<br>\
K [but wanting in a MS copy of the K and in<br>\
the CK:]) or he put his hand to it without the<br>\
intervention of anything: (Msb:) or مَسٌّ is like<br>\
لَمْسٌ; excepting that the latter is [sometimes]<br>\
used to signify the seeking for [or feeling for]<br>\
a thing, even though it be not found; whereas<br>\
the former is [only] said of that [action] with<br>\
which is perception by the sense of لمس: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [see also لَمَسَهُ:] and [in like<br>\
manner you say,] مَاسَّ الشَّىْءُ الشَّىْءَ, inf. n.<br>\
مُمَاسَّةٌ and مِسَاسٌ, (M, A, *) meaning, the thing<br>\
met [or touched] the thing with its substance.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] مَسَّهَا, (M, A, Msb,) first pers.<br>\
مَسِسْتُهَا, aor. يَمَسُّهَا, (Msb,) inf. n. مَسٌّ and مَسِيسٌ,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) (tropical:)  Inivit eam; scil. mulierem;<br>\
(M, A, Msb;) as also ↓ مَاسَّهَا, (M, A, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. مُمَاسَّةٌ (S, Msb) and مِسَاسٌ: (Msb:) the<br>\
former is used in this sense in several places in the<br>\
Kur, and is said by some to be preferable to the<br>\
latter: (TA:) and تَمَاسٌّ is also used metonymically for [the coming together, in the sense of]<br>\
مُبَاضَعَةٌ, as well as مُمَاسَّةٌ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  مَسَّ المَآءُ<br>\
الجَسَدَ, inf. n. مَسٌّ, (tropical:)  The water wetted the body.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  مَسَّ also signifies (tropical:)  He, or it, struck,<br>\
or smote; because striking, or smiting, like touching, is with the hand. (TA.) You say, مَسَّهُ<br>\
بِالسَّوْطِ (tropical:)  He struck him with the whip]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And it is said of anything annoying or hurtful<br>\
that befals a man. Thus in the Kur, [ii. 74,<br>\
and iii. 23,] لَنْ تَمَسَّنَا النَّارُ (tropical:)  [The fire of hell will<br>\
not smite us; or here it may be rendered touch<br>\
us]. And [ii. 210,] مَسَّتْهُمُ البَأْسَآءُ [Distress, or<br>\
misfortune, smote, or afflicted, or befell, them].<br>\
And in other instances; all which are similar to<br>\
the saying in the same, ذُوقُوا مَسَّ سَقَرَ. (TA.)<br>\
[See مَسٌّ below.] You say also, مَسَّهُ المَرَضُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Sickness smote him, or befell him]: and مَسَّهُ<br>\
العَذَابُ (tropical:)  [Punishment befell him]: and مَسَّهُ الكِبَرُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Old age came upon him]. (A.) And مَسَّتْهُ<br>\
الجِنُّ (tropical:)  [lit. The jinn, or genii touched him;<br>\
meaning, affected him with madness, or insanity]:<br>\
(TA:) [whence,] مُسَّ, [in the TA, مُسَّ بِهِ, app.<br>\
meaning, from what immediately precedes, مُسَّ<br>\
بِالجُنُونِ, inf. n. مَسٌّ,] He was, or became, [touched<br>\
with madness, or insanity: or] mad, or insane:<br>\
(K:) as though the jinn had touched him. (TA.)<br>\
And مَسَّهُ بِعَذَابٍ (tropical:)  He punished him. (TA, from<br>\
a trad.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [Hence, app.,] مَسَّتْ إِلَيْهِ الحَاجَةُ,<br>\
(S, K,) inf. n. [مَسٌّ and] مَسِيسٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  [which<br>\
seems to signify either The want of him, or it,<br>\
was difficult of accomplishment, or distressing;<br>\
or the want was difficult of accomplishment, or<br>\
distressing, to him]. (S, K,. [In both these<br>\
lexicons, the meaning is left to be inferred only<br>\
from the fact that this phrase immediately follows<br>\
the explanation of حَاجَةٌ مَاسَّةٌ, q. v.]) ―<br>\
-b7-  [مَسَّ is<br>\
also said of what is good, as well as of what is<br>\
evil; as in the following instance:] مَسَّتْهُ مَوَاسُّ<br>\
الخَيْرِ وَالشَّرِّ (tropical:)  [The haps of good fortune, and of<br>\
evil,] happened to him, or betided him. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  [As touching implies proximity,] مَسَّتْ بِكَ رَحِمُ<br>\
فُلَانٍ signifies (tropical:)  The relationship of such a one<br>\
is near to you. (S, K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And as مَسَّ<br>\
originally signifies “ he touched or felt with the<br>\
hand,” it is used metaphorically as meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  He took a thing; as, for instance, (in a trad.,)<br>\
water from a مِيضَأَة. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  مَسَّ is made<br>\
doubly trans. by means of the prep. بِ prefixed<br>\
to the second objective complement. (Msb.) See<br>\
4, in two places.<br>\
3<br>\
مَاْسَ3َ see 1, in two places: and see لَا مَسَاسِ.<br>\
4<br>\
إمسّهُ الشَّىْءَ He made him, or caused him,<br>\
to touch the thing: (S, * IJ, M, A: *) he enabled<br>\
him to touch it. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَمَسَّ الجَسَدَ مَآءً,<br>\
and الجَسَدَ بِمَآءٍ ↓ مَسَّ, (tropical:)  He wetted the body<br>\
with water; or caused water to wet the body.<br>\
(Msb.) And أَمَسَّ وَجْهَهُ الطِّيبَ (tropical:)  He smeared<br>\
his face with the perfume. (Mgh.) And أَمَسَّتْهُ<br>\
عَارِضَيْهَا, and بِعَارِضَيْهَا ↓ مَسَّتْهُ, (tropical:)  She smeared the<br>\
sides of her cheeks with it; namely, perfume.<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَمَسَّهُ شَكْوَى (tropical:)  He made a complaint<br>\
to him. (M, TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تماسّا They (two bodies) touched each<br>\
other; were, or became, in contact. (M, A, * K, *)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (K,) (tropical:)  They two came together in the<br>\
way of مُبَاضَعَة: (S, Msb, * K: *) in this sense<br>\
the verb is used in the Kur, lviii. 4 and 5.<br>\
(S, TA.) See also مَسَّهَا.<br>\
مَسٌّ: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is used to denote [the first<br>\
sensible effect of] anything annoying or hurtful<br>\
that befalls a man. (TA.) Thus in the Kur,<br>\
[liv. 48,] (TA,) ذُوقُوا مَسَّ سَقَرَ (tropical:)  Taste ye the<br>\
first effect upon you of the fire of hell: (K, TA:)<br>\
or the stroke thereof: (Jel:) or the heat and<br>\
pain thereof. (Bd.) In like manner you say,<br>\
(K,) وَجَدَ مَسَّ الحُمَّى (M, K) (tropical:)  He felt the<br>\
commencement, or first touch, [or access,] of<br>\
fever, before its taking him forcibly, and becoming<br>\
apparent. (M, L.) And لَمْ يَجِدْ مَسًّا مِنَ النَّصَبِ<br>\
(tropical:)  He did not feel the first sensation of fatigue.<br>\
(TA, from a trad.) [And hence,] بِهِ مَسٌّ مِنَ<br>\
الجُنُونِ (tropical:)  [In him is a touch, or stroke, of<br>\
madness, or insanity, or diabolical possession]:<br>\
(S, TA:) and مَسٌّ, alone, signifies madness, or<br>\
insanity, or diabolical possession: (M, A, * Mgh,<br>\
K:) as in the Kur, ii. 276: (TA:) and you say<br>\
بِهِ مَسٌّ in him is madness, &amp;c.: (A, * Mgh:) for<br>\
they assert that the devil touches one and his<br>\
intellect in consequence becomes confused. (Mgh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  You say also, هُوَ حَسَنُ المَسِّ فِى مَالِهِ (tropical:)  He<br>\
has the impress of a good state, or condition, in<br>\
his camels, or sheep, or goats: and رَأَيْتُ لَهُ مَسًّا<br>\

good state, or condition, in his camels, &amp;c.: like<br>\
as you say إِصْبَعًا. (A, TA.)<br>\
لَا مَسَاسِ, (S, M, K,) like قَطَامِ, (S, K,) indecl.,<br>\
with kesr for its termination, because altered<br>\
from the inf. n. مَسٌّ, (S,) signifies [properly<br>\
There shall be no touching: or] touch not thou:<br>\
(K:) or touch not thou me: (M:) and some<br>\
read thus in the Kur, [xx. 97:] (M, K:) it is<br>\
a saying of the Arabs: (S:) and sometimes one<br>\
says مَسَاسِ [alone], in the sense of an imperative,<br>\
[affirmatively,] like دَرَاكِ and نَزَالِ: (K:) but<br>\
↓ لَا مِسَاسَ, in the Kur, [ubi supra,] (S, M, K,)<br>\
accord. to the reading of others, (M,) signifies<br>\
There shall be no mutual touching: (M:) or I<br>\
will not touch nor will I be touched. (S, K.)<br>\
لَا مِسَاسَ: see لَا مَسَاسِ.<br>\
مَسُوسٌ (tropical:)  Water that is reached by the hands;<br>\
or taken with the extended hands: (M, K, * TA:)<br>\
in the K, نَالَتْهُ is put by mistake for تَنَاوَلَتْهُ<br>\
[which is the reading in the M]: (TA:) accord.<br>\
to which explanation, it has the signification of a<br>\
pass. part. n.: (M:) or, [in the K and,] (tropical:)  wholesome water, (A, TA,) that removes thirst, or the<br>\
heat of thirst, as soon as it touches it: (M, A, *<br>\
K, * TA:) accord. to which explanation, it has<br>\
the signification of an act. part. n.: (M:) and<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  anything that cures thirst, or the heat of thirst:<br>\
(IAar, K:) or, [in the K, and,] (assumed tropical:)  water between<br>\
sweet and salt: (S, K:) or, [in the K and,]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  sweet and clear water: (As, K:) and (assumed tropical:)  salt, or<br>\
bitter and thick and undrinkable, water, that<br>\
burns everything by its saltness. (M.) You say<br>\
also رِيقَةٌ مَسُوسٌ (tropical:)  Some saliva that takes away<br>\
thirst. (IAar, M.) And كَلَأٌ مَسُوسٌ (assumed tropical:)  Herbage<br>\
that has a fattening and beneficial effect upon the<br>\
animals that pasture on it. (AHn, M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
i. q. فَادْزَهْرٌ [The bezoar-stone]: (K:) or تِرْيَاقٌ<br>\
[an antidote against poison]: (M:) or both these<br>\
words by which it is explained mean the same<br>\
thing. (TA.)<br>\
مَسَّاسَةٌ: see مَاسَّهٌ.<br>\
حَاجَةٌ مَاسَّةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A want difficult of accomplishment; or pressing; syn. مُهِمْةٌ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
