مَعِزَ الشَّىْءُ, [and مَعِزَتِ الأَرْضُ, accord. to<br>\
the explanation of the inf. n. in the S,] aor.<br>\
مَعَزَ,<br>\
(TK,) inf. n. مَعَزٌ, (S, K, TK,) The thing [and<br>\
the ground] was, or became, hard. (S, * K, * TK.)<br>\
-A2-  مَعِزَ said of a man: see 4.<br>\
-A3-  مَعَزْتُ المِعْزَى,<br>\
وَضَأَنْتُ الضَّأْنَ, aor.<br>\
مَعَزَ, I set apart the goats from<br>\
the sheep. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
امعز He, (a man, A,) or it, (a people, S,)<br>\
became abundant in goats; his or its, goats became abundant, or numerous; (S, A, K;) as<br>\
also, ↓ مَعِزَ, aor.<br>\
مَعَزَ, (K,) inf. n. مَعَزٌ. (TK.)<br>\
مَعْزٌ, and ↓ مَعَزٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) gen. ns.,<br>\
(S, Msb,) [or rather quasi-pl. ns., signifying<br>\
Goats;] the kind of غَنَم opposed to ضَأْنٌ; (S,<br>\
A, K;) the kind of عَنَم that have hair; (Msb,<br>\
TA;) the ضأْن being those that have wool;<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ مِعْزًى, (S, Msb, K,) accord.<br>\
to Sb, (S,) with tenween, (S, Msb,) when indeterminate, (Msb,) and perfectly decl., (S,) the<br>\
ا [which is written ى] being a letter of quasicoördination, not a characteristic of the fem.<br>\
gender, (S, Msb,) for the word is quasi-coördinate to دِرْهَمٌ, of the measure فِعْلَلٌ; for the ا of<br>\
quasi-coördination follows the same rules as a<br>\
letter belonging to the word itself, as is shown<br>\
by their saying ↓ مُعَيْزٍ and أُرَيْطٍ [originally<br>\
مُعَيْزِىٌ and أُرَيْطِىٌ] as the dim. forms of مِعْزًى<br>\
and أَرْطًى with tenween, the letter next after<br>\
the ى of diminution being with kesr, like as they<br>\
say دُرَيْهِمٌ; for if the ا were to denote the fem.<br>\
gender they would not change it into ى [in<br>\
مُعَيْزِىٌ, the original form of مُعَيْزٍ,] like as they<br>\
do not change it in the dims. of حُبْلَى and أَخْرَى<br>\
[which are حُبَيْلَى and أُخَيْزَى]: (S:) it is<br>\
sometimes made fem., [by being written or<br>\
pronounced مِعْزَاةٌ,] and sometimes it is made imperfectly decl. [and therefore without tenween]:<br>\
(K:) Fr says, that it is [itself] fem., but that<br>\
some make it masc. [and therefore with tenween]: but A &#39;Obeyd says, that most of the<br>\
Arabs pronounce ذِفْرَى without tenween, while<br>\
some of them pronounce it with tenween, whereas<br>\
all of them pronounce مِعْزًى with tenween: (S:)<br>\
IAar says, that it is perfectly decl. when likened<br>\
to the measure مِفْعَلٌ, and imperfectly decl. when<br>\
held to accord. with the measure فِعْلَى: (TA:)<br>\
accord. to Aboo-&#39;Amr, Ibn-El-&#39;Alà, it is from<br>\
مَعَزٌ, [inf. n. of مَعِزَ,] and in like manner ذِفْرَى<br>\
is from ذَفَرٌ: (As, S:) ↓ مَعِيزٌ also signifies the<br>\
same as مَعْزٌ, (S, A, K,) or is pl. of مَعْزٌ, [or<br>\
rather a quasi-pl. n.] like as عَبِيدٌ is of عَبْدٌ;<br>\
(Msb;) and ↓ أُمْعُوزٌ also is syn. with مَعْزٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
and so are ↓ مِعَازٌ (K) and ↓ مِعْزَآءٌ: (Sgh, K:)<br>\
[respecting أُمْعُوزٌ, see also below:] مَعْزٌ [as well<br>\
as its syns. mentioned above, like all quasi-pl. ns.,<br>\
is sometimes masc., but generally] is fem.: (Msb:)<br>\
a male is called ↓ مَاعِزٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) and so<br>\
a female; (Msb, K;) or a female is called<br>\
↓ مَاعِزَةٌ (S, A, TA) [and ↓ مَعْزَةٌ (M, voce شَرْقَآءُ)] and<br>\
↓ مِعْزَاة; (TA;) and شَاةٌ [or rather شَاةٌ مِنَ المَعْزِ]<br>\
is also used as a sing., (Msb,) and is applied to<br>\
a male and to a female: (Msb, art. شوه:) [see also<br>\
ظَبْىٌ:] أَمْعُزٌ is a pl. [of pauc.] of مَعْزٌ, like as<br>\
أَعْبُدٌ is of عَبْدٌ: (Msb:) the pl. of ↓ مَاعِزٌ, (K,) or<br>\
of مَاعِزَةٌ, (S,) is مَوَاعِزُ; (S, K;) and ↓ مِعَازٌ and<br>\
↓ أُمْعُوزٌ are said to be quasi-pl. ns. (TA.) The goats<br>\
of the Arabs of the desert have short hair, not<br>\
long enough to be spun; but the goats of the cold<br>\
countries, and of the people of the fertile regions,<br>\
have abundant hair, and of this the Akrád [or<br>\
Kurds] fabricate their tents. (T in art. بنى.)<br>\

مُعَيْزٍ dim. of مِعْزْى, syn. of مَعْزٌ, q. v. (Sb, S.)<br>\
مَعَّازٌ A possessor, or master, of مِعْزًى [or goats].<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
مَاعِزٌ and مَاعِزَةٌ sings. of مَعْزٌ, q. v. (S, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
The former also signifies Goats&#39; skin. (S, K.)<br>\
أَمْعَزُ, and its fem. مَعْزَآءُ, applied respectively to<br>\
a place (مَكَانٌ) and to land or ground (أَرْضٌ),<br>\
(tropical:)  Hard, (S, K,) and abounding with pebbles: (S:)<br>\
or both, [used as substs.,] rugged and stony<br>\
ground: (A:) or a place abounding with pebbles,<br>\
and hard: or the latter, small pebbles: (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
TA:) thus A &#39;Obeyd explains a sing. as having a<br>\
pl. signification: (TA:) or the latter, a desert,<br>\
(صَحْرَآء) in which is elevation and ruggedness, consisting of soil, or clay, and pebbles, mixed together,<br>\
but hard ground, rough to the tread: (ISh, TA:)<br>\
pl. مُعْزٌ, (K,) [a pl. of each as an epithet, or of<br>\
each used as a subst.,] because imagined to have<br>\
the character of an epithet; (TA;) and أَمَاعِزُ, [a<br>\
pl. of the former,] because the character of a<br>\
subst. predominates in it; and مَعْزَاوَاتٌ, a pl. of<br>\
the latter. (TA.)<br>\
أُمْعُوزٌ: see its syn. مَعْزٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  It also signifies,<br>\
(K,) or is said to signify, (S,) A herd of gazelles,<br>\
(S, K,) in number from thirty to forty; (S, TA;)<br>\
or from thirty upwards: or a number of buckgazelles collected together: (TA:) or a number of<br>\
أَوْعَال [or mountain-goats] collected together: (A,<br>\
K:) or of اوعال such as are termed ثَيَاتِل: (Az,<br>\
TA:) pl. أَمَاعِيزُ and أَمَاعِزُ. (K.)<br>\
