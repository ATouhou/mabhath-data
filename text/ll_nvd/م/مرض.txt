مَرِضَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
مَرَضَ, inf. n. مَرَضٌ<br>\
and مَرْضٌ, (Msb, K,) which latter is a dial. form<br>\
rarely used, (Msb,) He (a man, S, or an animal<br>\
[of any kind], Msb) was, or became, [diseased,<br>\
disordered, distempered, sick, or ill; i. e.] in the<br>\
state termed مَرَضٌ (S, Msb, K) denoting that<br>\
change of the constitution or temperament which<br>\
is described in the explanation of this term<br>\
below; (K;) as also ↓ امرض, expl. by صَارَ ذَا<br>\
مَرَضٍ. (K, TA; but not in the CK.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence, مَرِضَتِ العَيْنُ (tropical:)  The eye became languid;<br>\
or languishing; or weak: (see مَرِيضٌ:) or, as<br>\
Golius says, on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof,<br>\
was weak from much, and too much, looking.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And مَرِضَتِ اللَّيْلَةُ (tropical:)  The night became dark.<br>\
(Th, O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [The verb probably has several<br>\
other tropical significations agreeable with explanations of مَرَضٌ and مَرِيضٌ which will be<br>\
found below.]<br>\
2<br>\
مرّضهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. تَمْرِيضٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) He took care of him in his sickness;<br>\
(Sb, S, Mgh;) and treated him medically, to<br>\
remove his disease; the measure فَعَّلَ in this<br>\
instance having a privative quality, though its<br>\
quality is in most instances confirmative: (Sb:)<br>\
or he took good care of him, namely a sick<br>\
person: (K:) or he undertook, or managed, or<br>\
superintended, the medical treatment of him.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  مرّض فِى الأَمْرِ, (IDrd, A,) [and<br>\
مَرَّضَهُ, (O, K voce ضَهْيَأَ,)] inf. n. as above,<br>\
(S, K,) (tropical:)  He fell short of doing what he ought to<br>\
have done, or was remiss, in, or with respect to,<br>\
the affair: (S, A:) or he did not exert himself<br>\
to the full, or to the utmost, or beyond what is<br>\
usual, in it: (IDrd:) or he did it weakly, or<br>\
feebly, (K, * TA,) not firmly or soundly: (TA:)<br>\
as also فِيهِ ↓ مارض. (TA.) [See also 5.] And<br>\
مرّض فُلَانٌ فِى حَاجَتِى (tropical:)  Such a one was deficient<br>\
in activity in accomplishing my want. (TA.)<br>\
And مرّض فِى كَلَامِهِ (tropical:)  He was weak in his<br>\
speech. (IDrd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [حَكَاهُ بِصِيغَةِ التَّمْرِيضِ, probably a post-classical phrase, signifies (assumed tropical:)  He mentioned it, or related it, in a manner implying<br>\
that it was doubtful, or was a mere assertion;<br>\
as when the word قِيلَ is used.]<br>\
3<br>\
مارض فِى الأَمْرِ: see 2. ―<br>\
-b2-  مَارَضْتُ رَأْيِى فِيكَ<br>\
(tropical:)  I deceived myself, or endeavoured to deceive<br>\
myself, respecting thee. (A, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
امرض: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  He had a bane, or murrain, (Yaakoob, S,) or a disease, or distemper,<br>\
(A, TA,) in his beasts, (Yaakoob, S, A,) or<br>\
camels. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  امرضهُ He (God, S, Msb)<br>\
rendered him مَرِيض [or diseased, &amp;c.]. (Sb,<br>\
S, * Msb, K.) You say also, أَكَلَ مَا لَمْ يُوَافِقْهُ<br>\
فَأَمْرَضَهُ (A, TA) [He ate what did not agree<br>\
with him, and] it caused him to fall into المَرَض<br>\
[or disease, &amp;c.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] إِمْرَاضُ<br>\
الأجْفَانِ (S, voce إِسْجَادٌ) (tropical:)  The lowering of the<br>\
eyelids [in a languid, or languishing, manner:<br>\
see مَرِيضٌ]. (TK, voce إِسْجَادٌ.) ―<br>\
-b3-  امرضهُ also<br>\
signifies He found him to be مَرِيض [or diseased,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  Also امرض (assumed tropical:)  He was near to<br>\
being right in opinion, (S, L, K, *) though not<br>\
altogether right. (L.) In the K, this signification is wrongly assigned to امرضهُ. (TA.)<br>\
A poet says, (S,) namely El-Ukeyshir El-Asadee,<br>\
praising &#39;Abd-el-Melik Ibn-Marwán, (TA.)<br>\
وَلٰكِنْ تَحْتَ ذَاكَ الشَّيْبِ حَزْمٌ<br>\
إِذَا مَا ظَنَّ أَمْرَضَ أَوْ أَصَابَا<br>\
[But beneath that hoariness is good judgment:<br>\
when he forms an opinion, he is nearly right, or<br>\
he is right]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, امرضهُ فُلَانٌ<br>\
(tropical:)  Such a one was near to attaining the object of<br>\
his [another&#39;s] want. (A, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تمرّض (tropical:)  He was weak, or feeble, in his<br>\
affair. (A, * K, TA.) [It seems to be indicated<br>\
in the A that ↓ تمارض also has this signification;<br>\
like as مارض in nearly the same sense is syn.<br>\
with مرّض, q. v.: or perhaps تمارض signifies<br>\
(tropical:)  he feigned, or made a false show of, weakness, or<br>\
feebleness, in his affair: it is said, in the A, to be<br>\
used tropically as well as properly.]<br>\
6<br>\
تمارض He feigned, or made a false show<br>\
of, مَرَض [or disease, &amp;c.] in himself. (S, A. *)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also 5.<br>\
مَرْضٌ: see 1: and see what here next follows,<br>\
in six places.<br>\
مَرَضٌ (IDrd, S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ مَرْضٌ:<br>\
(Msb, K:) see 1: i. q. سُقْمٌ [Disease, disorder,<br>\
distemper, sickness, illness, or malady]; (IDrd,<br>\
S;) which is the contr. of صِحَّةٌ; and affects man<br>\
and the camel [&amp;c.]: (IDrd:) or  a certain state<br>\
foreign to the constitution or temperament, injurious to the intellect; whence it is known that<br>\
pains and tumours are accidents arising therefrom: or, as IF says, that whereby a man passes<br>\
beyond the limit of health or soundness or perfection or rectitude, whether it be disease (عِلَّة),<br>\
or (assumed tropical:)  hypocrisy, or (assumed tropical:)  a falling short of doing what<br>\
he ought to do in an affair: (Msb:) or a dark<br>\
and disordered state of the constitution or temperament, after a clear and right state thereof:<br>\
(O, K:) or ↓ مَرْضٌ is (assumed tropical:)  [a disease] of the heart:<br>\
(K:) Aboo-Is-hák says, مَرَضٌ and سُقْمٌ are said<br>\
to be in the body and (assumed tropical:)  in religion, like as صِحَّةٌ<br>\
is said to be in the body and in religion; and<br>\
↓ مَرْضٌ is in the heart, applying to (assumed tropical:)  everything<br>\
whereby a man quits a state of soundness or<br>\
perfection or rectitude in religion: (TA:) and<br>\
As says, I recited to Aboo-&#39;Amr Ibn-El-&#39;Alà<br>\
[the words of the Kur, ii. 9, &amp;c.,] فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَرَضٌ<br>\
and he said to me ↓ “ مَرْضٌ, O boy ”: (AHát,<br>\
IDrd, Msb:) and مَرَضٌ, or this and ↓ مَرْضٌ<br>\
also, signifies (assumed tropical:)  doubt: and (assumed tropical:)  hypocrisy: (K:)<br>\
and (assumed tropical:)  weakness of belief: (TA:) and the former,<br>\
(TA,) or ↓ both, (K,) (assumed tropical:)  languor, or languidness,<br>\
or weakness: (K:) and (assumed tropical:)  darkness (IAar, K)<br>\
in the heart: (IAar:) and (assumed tropical:)  defectiveness; deficiency; or imperfection; (IAar, K;) which<br>\
last is said by IAar to be the primary signification: (TA:) or مَرَضٌ in the body is a<br>\
languor, or languidness, or weakness, of the limbs,<br>\
or members: and in the eye, (assumed tropical:)  weakness of sight:<br>\
and in the heart, (assumed tropical:)  a flagging, or remissness, in<br>\
respect of the truth: (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh:) or it properly signifies an accidental affection of the<br>\
body, which puts it out of the right state proper<br>\
to it, and necessarily occasions interruption, or<br>\
infirmity, in its actions: and tropically, (tropical:)  affections of the mind, which interrupt, or mar, its<br>\
integrity; such as (tropical:)  ignorance; and (tropical:)  evil belief;<br>\
and (tropical:)  envy; and (tropical:)  malevolence, or malice; and<br>\
(tropical:)  love of acts of disobedience; for these prevent<br>\
from the attaining of excellences, or lead to the<br>\
cessation of true eternal life: (Bd, ii. 9:) it is a<br>\
gen. n.: (IDrd:) and the n. un. is ↓ مَرْضَةٌ:<br>\
(A, TA:) it is one of the inf. ns. which have<br>\
pls., like شُغْلٌ and عَقْلٌ; the pls. of these three<br>\
being أَمْرَاضٌ and أَشْغَالٌ and عُقُولٌ. (Sb.) فِى<br>\
قُلْوبِهِمْ مَرَضٌ, in the Kur, [ii. 9, &amp;c.,] means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  In their hearts is doubt: (AO:) or (assumed tropical:)  doubt<br>\
and hypocrisy. (TA.) And الَّذِى فِى قَلْبِهِ مَرَضٌ,<br>\
in the same, [xxxiii. 32,] (assumed tropical:)  In whose heart is<br>\
darkness: or (assumed tropical:)  flagging, or remissness, in respect<br>\
of what is commanded and what is forbidden:<br>\
or (assumed tropical:)  love of adultery or fornication: (TA:)<br>\
or hypocrisy. (A.)<br>\

sick; or ill;] in the state termed مَرَضٌ (Msb, K)<br>\
denoting that change of the constitution or temperament which is described in the explanation<br>\
of the latter word above; (K;) as also ↓ مَرِضٌ<br>\
(K,) and ↓ مَارِضٌ, (IB, Msb, K,) the first [and<br>\
second] being from the verb of which the inf. n.<br>\
is مَرَضٌ, and the third from that of which the<br>\
inf. n. is مَرْضٌ, (Msb,) and ↓ مَمْرُوضٌ, and<br>\
↓ مُتَمَرِّضٌ: (TA:) or, applied to a body, it signifies deficient in strength: (IAar:) pl. مِرَاضٌ<br>\
(A, K, TA:) and مَرْضَى (IDrd, Msb, K) and<br>\
مَرَاضَى (IDrd, K) and مُرَضَآءُ; (TA;) or مِرَاضٌ<br>\
may be pl. of مَارِضٌ (TA) [or of مَرِضٌ]. Accord.<br>\
to Lh, you say, عُدْ فُلَانٌ فَإِنَّهُ مَرِيضٌ [Visit thou<br>\
such a one, for he is sick]: and لَا تَأْكُلْ هٰذَا<br>\
إِنْ أَكَلْتَهُ ↓ الطَّعَامَ فَإِنَّكَ مَارِضٌ meaning تَمْرَضُ<br>\
[i. e. Eat not thou this food, for thou wilt be sick<br>\
if thou eat it]. (TA.) [مَرِيضٌ has also several<br>\
tropical significations.] You say also, عَيْنٌ مَرِيضَةٌ<br>\
(tropical:)  An eye in which is languor, or languidness, or<br>\
weakness: (S, TA:) pl. أَعْيَنٌ مِرَاضٌ, and مَرْضَى.<br>\

what is right. (TA.)<br>\
مَارِضٌ: see مَرِيضٌ, in two places.<br>\
مُمْرِضٌ A man having diseased camels: so in<br>\
the following trad.: لَا يُورِدُ مُمْرِضٌ عَلَى مُصِحٍّ<br>\
[One having diseased camels shall not bring them<br>\
to water immediately after one whose camels are<br>\
in a healthy state]: the prohibition being not<br>\
because of the transition of disease by contagion;<br>\
but because sometimes disease may befall the<br>\
healthy beasts, and it may come into the mind<br>\
of the owner that that is from contagion. (TA.)<br>\
[See also مُصِحٌّ.]<br>\
مِمْرَاضٌ A man frequently diseased or sick.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
