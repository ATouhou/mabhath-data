مِيرَةٌ: i. q. طَعَامٌ [here meaning Wheat, or other<br>\
corn, and food, victuals, or provision, of any<br>\
kind,] (T, S, A, * Mgh, Msb, K, *) which a man<br>\
brings, or conveys or purveys (يَمْتَارُهُ) [to be laid<br>\
up in store for himself or his family or household,<br>\
or for sale]; (S, TA;) and ↓ مَيْرٌ signifies the<br>\
same as مِيرَةٌ [in these senses, as will be seen<br>\
from what follows], and is applied to victuals, or<br>\
food, or aliment, syn. قُوتٌ. (TA.) Ex. جَالِبُ<br>\
المِيرَةِ, (K,) or ↓ المَيْرِ, (M,) [The bringer, or<br>\
conveyer, or purveyor, of wheat, &amp;c.] And<br>\
أَتَاهُ بِمِيرَةٍ He brought him طَعَام. (T.) And<br>\
جَاؤُوا بِالْمِيرَةِ [They brought, or conveyed, or<br>\
purveyed, the wheat, &amp;c.] (A.) And مَا عِنْدَهُ<br>\
↓ خَيْرٌ وَلَا مَيْرٌ [He has not wealth, nor wheat, &amp;c.]<br>\
(T, S, A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (T,) The bringing, or conveying, or purveyance, of طَعَام [here meaning<br>\
as explained above] from another place (T, M,<br>\
A, K,) [for one&#39;s self or family or household,<br>\
(see 1,) or] for sale: (T:) pl. مِيَرٌ. (M, arts.<br>\
دفأ and صيف; &amp;c.) The first مِيرَة is the رِبْعِيَّة<br>\
(M, arts. دفأ and صيف,) which is the ميرة in<br>\
the beginning of [the season called] the شِتَآء [or<br>\
winter, i. e., in the latter part of December or in<br>\
January, during the season of rains called<br>\
الرَّبِيع, about which time, the species of millet<br>\
called ذُرَة, which, as Niebuhr mentions, (Descr.<br>\
de l&#39;Arabie, p. 135, note,) is called in El-Yemen<br>\
طَعَام, is gathered in]: (S, K, art. ربع:) the<br>\
second, the صَيْفِيَّة, (M, arts, دفأ and صيف,) also<br>\
called the صَائِفَة, (S, M, K, art. صيف,) which is<br>\
the ميرة in [the season called] the صَيْف [or<br>\
spring], (S, M, art. صيف,) in the first part of<br>\
the صَيْف [i. e., in the latter part of March, about<br>\
which time, wheat, and a second crop of millet<br>\
(ذُرَة), and barley, are gathered in]: (M, art.<br>\
صيف:) the third, the دَفَئِيَّة, (M, arts. دفأ and<br>\
صيف,) which is [also] in the first part of [the<br>\
season called] the صَيْف [or spring, and consequently immediately after the صَيْفِيَّة, commencing in the season of the دَفَئِىّ rains, and<br>\
app. continuing during part of April, when the<br>\
same grains are gathered in; or by the صَيْف<br>\
in this instance may be meant summer, but<br>\
the more proper meaning is spring, and the<br>\
term دَفَئِيَّةٌ seems already to point to the<br>\
season of the دَفَئِىّ rains]: (M, art. دفأ:) and<br>\
the fourth, the رَمَضِيَّة, (M, arts. دفأ and صيف,)<br>\
which is the ميرة coming when the earth<br>\
becomes burnt [by the sun, about July, when<br>\
the month of رَمَضَان began at the period when<br>\
the calendar by the months was fixed by Kiláb<br>\
Ibn-Murrah, about two centuries before the<br>\
Hijreh, and at which season of the year a third<br>\
crop of ذُرَة is gathered in; for in some parts of<br>\
Arabia they have three crops of this grain in<br>\
the year; the second and third being sown<br>\
immediately after, or produced by the grain<br>\
which is let fall in cutting, the first and second].<br>\
(M, art. دفأ.)<br>\
مَيَّارٌ: see مَائِرٌ.<br>\
مَائِرٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ مَيَّارٌ (M, K) One who<br>\
brings, or conveys, or purveys, مِيرَة, (S, * K,) or<br>\
مَيْر: (M, L:) pl. of the former, مُيَّارٌ (S, M, K)<br>\
and مَيَّارَةٌ, like رَجَّالَةٌ. (S, K.) You say نَحْنُ<br>\
نَنْتَظِرُ مُيَّارَنَا, and مَيَّارَتَنَا, [We are expecting our<br>\
bringers, or conveyers, or purveyors, of wheat,<br>\
&amp;c.] (S.) The pl. مَيَّارَةٌ is applied to A company of men who go together from the desert to<br>\
the towns or villages to bring مِيرَة. (TA.) It is<br>\
said in a trad. الحَمُولَةُ المَائِرَةُ لَهُمْ لاَغِيَةٌ, meaning,<br>\
The camels that carry مِيرَة for them for sale<br>\
and the like are exempt from the eleëmosynary<br>\
taxation, because they are working beasts.<br>\
