(Msb, K,) well known; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) [the<br>\
fruit of the banana-tree, or musa paradisiaca;]<br>\
i. q. طَلْحٌ [in one of the acceptations of this latter<br>\
word]: (Msb:) it is lenitive, diuretic, provocative<br>\
of venery, and augments the spermatic fluid and<br>\
the phlegm and the yellow bile, and the eating<br>\
much of it is very oppressive, (K,) for it is slow<br>\
of digestion: (TA:) the tree grows in the manner<br>\
of the بَرْدِىّ, [i. e., papyrus, or perhaps other<br>\
rushes,] and has a long and broad leaf, which may<br>\
be three cubits by two cubits, (AHn, Mgh, TA,)<br>\
the مَوْز [i. e., the fruit] is found, where it grows,<br>\
throughout the whole year, (AHn, as cited by<br>\
&#39;Abd-El-Lateef,) and there may be on one of its<br>\
racemes from thirty to five hundred fruits; (AHn,<br>\
Mgh, K, TA;) this is seen in the districts of<br>\
Makdishoo [between Abyssinia and the country<br>\
of the Zenj]; (TA;) and when this is the case,<br>\
the raceme is propped up; (AHn, Mgh;) it rises<br>\
to the height of the stature of a man, [and higher,]<br>\
and its offsets continually grow around it, every<br>\
one of them smaller than another; and when it<br>\
has produced its fruit, the mother-tree is cut down<br>\
at the foot, and its offset that has attained to its<br>\
height fructifies, and becomes a mother, the rest<br>\
remaining its offsets, and thus it continues: whence<br>\
the saying of Ash&#39;ab, to his son, as related by As,<br>\
Wherefore dost thou not become like me? to<br>\
which he answered, Such as I is like the مَوْزَة,<br>\
which does not attain to a good state until its<br>\
mother dies. (AHn, TA.) مَوْزَةٌ is the n. un.<br>\
(S, Msb.)<br>\
مَوَّازٌ A seller of مَوْز [or fruit of the bananatree]. (K.)<br>\
