in his running. (K, in which only the inf. n. is<br>\
mentioned.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He (a-horse) stretched forth his<br>\
arms, (مَذَّ ضَبْعَيْهِ, S, M, L, K,) in running, (S,) to<br>\
a degree that he could not exceed, to overtake,<br>\
(حَتَّى لَا يَجِدَ مَزِيدًا لِلِّحَاقٍ, M, L, K,) and contracted, or drew in, (حَبَسَ, [perhaps a mistake for<br>\
خَنَسَ, which may mean either contracted, or<br>\
threw back,]) his hind legs to a degree that he could<br>\
not exceed, to overtake, without any confusion [in<br>\
his motions]. (M, L.) ―<br>\

which rejoiced him, without doing, or performing,<br>\

(M, K:) [in some copies of the K, by a mistake<br>\
in the last vowel-sign, each of the last three of<br>\
these epithets is as though it were syn. with<br>\

who, if asked, will not tell truly whence he comes;<br>\
