[The milk will not die], in a saying of &#39;Omar,<br>\

of a dead woman, it becomes unlawful for him<br>\
afterwards to marry any of her relations who<br>\
would be unlawful to him if he sucked her milk<br>\
while she was living: or it means, that, if milk<br>\
taken from the breast of a woman is given to a<br>\
child to drink, and he drinks it, the consequence<br>\
is the same; that the effect of the milk in producing this consequence is not annulled by its<br>\
separation from the breast; for whatever is<br>\

dead, except the milk and hair and wool on<br>\
account of the necessity of making use of these.<br>\

contr. of حَيَوَانٌ [q. v.] (S, K.) It is made of<br>\

properly belonging to inf. ns. (TA.) [See also<br>\
مَوَاتٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  إِشْتَرِ المَوَتَانَ وَلا تَشْتَرِ الحَيَوَانَ Buy<br>\

that has no owner (S, K) of mankind, and of<br>\
which no use is made, or from which no<br>\
advantage is derived, (S,) and in which is no<br>\
water: such as is also called ↓ أَرْضٌ مَيْتَةٌ:<br>\
(En-Nawawee:) land that has not been sown,<br>\
nor cultivated, nor occupied by any man&#39;s camels<br>\
&amp;c.: ↓ مَوَتَانٌ signifies the same as مُوَاتٌ (مَوَاتٌ?),<br>\
namely, land that is no man&#39;s property; and<br>\
is also written مَوْتَانٌ: (L:) or مَوَتَانٌ signifies<br>\
land that has not yet been brought into a state<br>\
of cultivation: (Fr, S, L, K:) in a trad. it is said,<br>\
that such land is the property of God and his<br>\
Apostle; and whosoever brings into a state of<br>\
cultivation such land, to him it belongs. (S.)<br>\
مُوَاتٌ: see مَوْتٌ and مُوتَانٌ.<br>\
مَيِّتٌ and ↓ مَيْتٌ signify the same, [Dead, or<br>\
dying]: (Zj, S, K:) the former is originally<br>\
مَيْوِتٌ, of the measure فَيْعِلٌ: (S:) the latter is<br>\
contracted from the former; and is both masc.<br>\
and fem.; (Zj, S;) as is also the former. (Zj.)<br>\
&#39;Adee Ibn-Er-Raalà says,<br>\
↓ لَيْسَ مَنْ مَاتَ فَاسْتَرَاحَ بِمَيْتٍ<br>\
إِنَّمَا المَيْتُ مَيِّتُ الأَحْيَآءِ<br>\
[He who has died and become at rest is not dead:<br>\
the dead is only the dead of the living]. (S, TA.)<br>\
Or ↓ مَيْتٌ signifies One who has died (actually,<br>\
TA,); and مَيِّتٌ, as also ↓ مَائِتٌ, one who has<br>\
not yet died, (K,) but who is near to dying: or,<br>\
accord. to a verse cited by AA, to Kh, مَيْتٌ is<br>\
applied to him who is borne to the grave; [i. e.,<br>\
who is dead, or lifeless]; and مَيِّتٌ, to him who<br>\
[is dying, but] has life in him. (TA.) Fr says,<br>\
you say of him who has not died, إِنَّهُ مَائِتٌ,<br>\
عَنْ قَلِيلٍ ↓ and مَيِّتٌ; but you do not say of<br>\
him who has died ↓ هذا مَائِتٌ: (S:) but some<br>\
say, that this is an error, and that مَيِّتٌ is<br>\
applicable to that which will soon die. Those who<br>\
assert that ميّت is applicable only to the living<br>\
adduce the following words of the Kur, [xxxix.<br>\
31,] إِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ وَإِنَّهُمْ مَيِّتُونَ: (TA:) i. e. Verily<br>\
thou wilt die, and verily they will die. (Msb.)<br>\
MF observes, that مَيْتٌ is asserted to be contracted from مَيِّتٌ; and if so, that there can be<br>\
no difference in their meanings: that the making<br>\
a difference between them is contrary to analogy;<br>\
agreeably with which, they should be like هَيْنٌ<br>\
and هَيِّنٌ, and لَيْنٌ and لَيِّنٌ: and also contrary<br>\
to what has been heard from the Arabs; for<br>\
they made no difference in their use of these two<br>\
words. (TA.) [See also what is said of مَيْتَةٌ,<br>\
below.] The pls. are أَمْوَاتٌ and مَوْتَى and مَيِّتُونَ<br>\
and مَيْتُونَ. (S, K.) The first of these is pl. of<br>\
مَيِّتٌ, and consequently of مَيْتٌ, because this<br>\
latter is contracted from the former: as مَيِّتٌ is<br>\
of the measure فَيْعِلٌ, and this measure resembles<br>\
فَاعِلٌ, it has received a form of pl. which is<br>\
sometimes applicable to the measure فاعل: (Sb:)<br>\
or اموات is [only] pl. of مَيْتٌ. (Msb.) [The<br>\
second form (which is applied to rational beings,<br>\
Msb,) is also pl. of ميّت and ميت.] The third<br>\
and fourth are [only] applied to rational beings.<br>\
(Msb.) The fem. epithet is مَيِّتَةٌ and مَيْتَةٌ and<br>\
مَيِّتٌ (K, TA) and مَيْتٌ. (TA; and so in some<br>\
copies of the K, in the place of مَيِّتٌ.) مَيِّتَةٌ is an<br>\
epithet applied to a female rational being; [and its<br>\
pl. is مَيِّتَاتٌ:] مَيْتَةٌ, to a female brute, for the<br>\
sake of distinction; and its pl. is مَيْتَاتٌ: the<br>\
latter is contracted because it is more in use than<br>\
the former epithet applied to a female rational<br>\
being: (Msb:) the pl. of ميّت and ميت as<br>\
fem. epithets is as above [أَمْوَاتٌ and مَوْتَى].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ↓ مَيْتَةٌ signifies That which has not<br>\
been slaughtered (AA, S, K) [in the manner<br>\
prescribed by the law, i. e., carrion]: or that of<br>\
which the life has departed without slaughter:<br>\
so in the classical language and in the language<br>\
of practical law: all such is unlawful to be<br>\
eaten, except fish and locusts, which are lawful by universal consent of the Muslims: (En-Nawawee:) or, in the common acceptation of the<br>\
language of law, what has died a natural death,<br>\
or been killed in a state or manner different from<br>\
that prescribed by the law, either the agent or<br>\
the animal killed not being such as is so prescribed; as that which is sacrificed to an idol,<br>\
or slaughtered [by a person] in the state of<br>\
إِحْرَام, or not by having the throat cut, and<br>\
that which it is unlawful to eat, such as a dog:<br>\
(Msb:) [and any separated part of an animal<br>\
of which the flesh is not lawful food: see عَاجٌ.] ―<br>\

pasture, (Msb, in art. بلد.) ―<br>\

مُتَمَاوِتٌ (tropical:)  [Feigning himself dead]. ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  An<br>\
epithet applied to A hypocritical devotee, (S, K,)<br>\
who pretends to be like one dead in his devotion,<br>\
who lowers his voice, and moves little: as though<br>\
he were one who put on the outward appearance<br>\
of devotees, and constrained himself to characterize himself by the characteristics of the dead,<br>\
that he might be imagined to be weak by reason<br>\
of much devotion. (TA.)<br>\
مُسْتَمِيتٌ A courageous man, who seeks, or<br>\
courts death: (K:) a man who seeks to be slain;<br>\
who cares not, in war, for death: (S:) abandon-<br>\
ing, or devoting, himself to death, (مسْتَرْسِلٌ لِلْمَوْتِ,)<br>\
as also مُسْتَقْتِلٌ. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  Abandoning, or devoting<br>\
himself to a thing, or affair; syn. مُسْتَرْسِلٌ لِأَمْرٍ.<br>\

وَاللَّيْلُ فَوْقَ المَاءِ مُسْتَمِيتُ<br>\
[And to the froth of the sea there was a sound<br>\
like that of boiling, and night impended over the<br>\
water]. (S.) [It is implied in the S that<br>\
مستميت here signifies مُسْتَرْسِل.] ―<br>\
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  One who<br>\
feigns himself to be insane, or possessed by a devil;<br>\
not being really so. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  (assumed tropical:)  One who feigns<br>\
