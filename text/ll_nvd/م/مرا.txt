wholesome, or approved in its result: (Z:) or<br>\
easy to swallow, and wholesome, or approved in<br>\
its result: (K:) or easy to swallow, not attended<br>\
by trouble: or quick in digesting. (Z.) It is<br>\
said in the Keshsháf, on ch. iv., v. 3, of the Kur,<br>\
that هَنِىْءٌ and مَرِىْءٌ are two epithets from<br>\
هَنَأَ الطَّعَامُ and مَرَأَ, “the food was easy to<br>\
swallow; not attended by trouble:” or the<br>\
former epithet signifies “ pleasant, or productive<br>\
of enjoyment, to the eater; ” and the latter,<br>\
“wholesome, or approved in its result: ” or<br>\
the former, food or drink that is “ not succeeded<br>\
by harm, even after its digestion;” and the<br>\
latter, that which is “ quick in digesting. ”<br>\
(TA.) In conjunction with هَنَأَنِى, one says مَرَأَنِى<br>\
(هنأنى الطَّعَامُ ومرأنى), (Fr. S, K,) aor.<br>\
مَرَاَ, inf. n.<br>\

authority of Akh];) and alone, (i. e. not in conjunction with هنأنى or هنئنى,) ↓ أَمْرَأَنِى, (Fr,<br>\
S, K,) inf. n. إِمْرَآءٌ, (AZ,) [It (food) was wholesome to me, &amp;c. (see above):] it was light to my<br>\
stomach, and descended thence well. (TA.) But<br>\
مَرَأَنِى also occurs in this sense without هَنَأَنِى.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\

is approved, and shunning what is held base;<br>\
(El-Khafájee;) or in preserving the soul from<br>\
filthy actions, and what disgraces in the estimation of men; or in good manners, and guarding the tongue, and shunning impudence; (TA;)<br>\
or in a quality of the mind by preserving which<br>\

-b3-<br>\
لَا يَتَمَرَّأْ أَحَدُكُمْ بِالدُّنْيَا (a trad.) [app., Let not<br>\
any one of you delight himself in the present<br>\
world]: but accord. to one relation, it is<br>\
لَا يَتَمَرْأَى, from الرُّؤْيَةُ: [see art. رأى]. (TA.)<br>\
[See also تَهَنَّأَ.]<br>\

إِسْتَمْرَاَ see 1.<br>\
مَرْءٌ and ↓ مُرْءٌ (S, K) and ↓ مِرْءٌ (K) A man, or<br>\
human being; syn. إِنْسَانٌ: (K:) or a man as<br>\
opposed to a child or a woman; syn. رَجُلٌ.<br>\
(S, K.) You say مَرْءٌ in the nom., مَرْءًا in the<br>\
acc., and مَرْءٍ in the gen., (S,) agreeably with<br>\
analogy. (TA.) And some say مُرْءٌ in the nom.,<br>\
مَرْءًا in the acc., and مِرْءٍ in the gen.; doubly<br>\
declining the word. (TA, and some copies of<br>\
the S.) And ↓ مِرْء is said to be of the dial. of<br>\
Hudheyl. It is said that no pl. is formed from<br>\
مرء; but مَرْؤُونَ occurs as its pl. in the following<br>\
words of a trad.; أَحْسِنُوا أَمْلَاءَكُمْ أَيُّهَا المُرْؤُونَ<br>\
[Amend your manners, O ye men!]; and in the<br>\
saying of Ru-beh, أَيْنَ يُرِيدُ المرؤون [Whither<br>\
do the men desire to go?]. (TA.) It forms a<br>\
dual; مَرْآنِ: CCC they say هُمَا مِرْآنِ صَالِحَانِ [They<br>\
are two just men] (S) in the dial. of Hudheyl.<br>\
(TA.) It also forms a dim., مُرَىْءٌ, fem. مُرَيْئَةٌ.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The fem. of مَرْءٌ is مَرْأَةٌ, A woman: [and<br>\
a wife:] also written and pronounced مَرَةٌ. (S,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  مرء is also written with the conjunctive ا:<br>\
you say امْرَأٌ in the nom., امْرَأً in the acc., and<br>\
امْرَأٍ in the gen.: also, امْرُؤٌ in the nom., امْرُؤًا<br>\
in the acc., and امْرُؤٍ in the gen.: also, امْرُؤٌ in the<br>\
nom., امْرَأً in the acc., and امْرِئٍ in the gen.;<br>\
doubly declining the word. (S, K, TA.) [The<br>\
last three forms are the most common in classical<br>\
works: but in ordinary parlance, in the present<br>\
day, the word is generally pronounced with fet-h<br>\
to the ر in each case. The final ء is also often<br>\
written without the ا or و or ى.] Ks and Fr<br>\
say, that the word is doubly declined, as to the<br>\
ر and ء, because the final ء is often omitted.<br>\
(T, TA.) [When the disjunctive ا is substituted<br>\
for the conjunctive, i. e., when the word is immediately preceded by a quiescence, its vowel is<br>\
kesr: thus you say اِمْرَأٌ &amp;c.; and thus<br>\
also in the fem. The name of the famous poet<br>\
اِمْرَأُ القَيْسِ CCC is commonly pronounced Imra-el-<br>\
Keys and Imr-el-Keys.] ―<br>\
-b4-  The fem. is امْرَأَةٌ,<br>\
A woman: [and a wife:] but with ال you say<br>\
المَرْأَةُ: الاِمْرَأَةُ [which is authorized by the K]<br>\
is also said to be established by usage; but most<br>\
of the expositors of the Fs reject this; and those<br>\
who allow it to be correct judge it of weak<br>\
authority: IO mentions also امْرَاةٌ, with soft ا<br>\
after the ر. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  امْرَُءٌ is also used in a fem.<br>\
sense; (S;) though this is extr.: ex. إِنَّهَا لَامْرَُءَ<br>\
صِدْق [Verily she is an excellent woman: see<br>\
صِدْقٌ]. (TA.) And امْرَأَةٌ is used, in a trad.,<br>\
as signifying a perfect woman: لَقَدْ تَزَوَّجْتَ امْرَأَةً<br>\
Indeed thou hast married a perfect woman: like<br>\
as you say فُلَانٌ رَجُلٌ, meaning “ Such a one is<br>\
a perfect man. ” (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also, اِمْرَأٌ or امْرُؤٌ,<br>\
(S,) or مَرْءٌ, (K,) signifies A wolf: (S, K:) or,<br>\
as Z and others assert, it is tropical in this sense.<br>\
Yoo says, that the poet means, by امرؤ, in the<br>\
following verse, a wolf:<br>\
وَأَنْتَ امْرُؤٌ تَعْدُو عَلَى كُلِّ غِرَّةٍ<br>\
فَتُخْطِئُ فِيهَا مَرَّةً وَتُصِيبُ<br>\
[And thou art a wolf that assaultest on every<br>\
occasion of carelessness; and sometimes thou<br>\
missest therein, and (sometimes) thou attainest<br>\
thine object]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  The rel. n. of امْرَُءٌ is<br>\
مَرَئِىٌّ (as in one copy of the S) or مُرَئِىٌّ (as in<br>\
another copy) and أَمَرِىٌّ. (S, and El-Ashmoonee<br>\
and others.) [For the last, Golius, from a copy<br>\
of the S, gives اِمْرَئِىٌّ: and in one copy of the S,<br>\
I find it written أَمْرَئِىٌّ: but I have not met with<br>\
any confirmation of either of these two forms.]<br>\
مَرَئِىٌّ seems to be formed from مَرْءٌ; but is extr.;<br>\
the analogous form being مَرْئِىٌّ. (TA.)<br>\
مَرَأٌ A giving of food on the occasion of building<br>\
a house, or marrying. (TA.)<br>\
مَرِىْءٌ [The œsophagus, or gullet of a slaughtered<br>\
camel, or sheep or goat, (S,) and of a man, (Zj,<br>\
in his Khalk el-Insán,) the canal through which<br>\
the food and drink pass; (S, K;) the head of the<br>\
stomach; (K;) contiguous, (S,) or adherent (K)<br>\
to the حُلْقُوم [or windpipe]; (S, K;) through<br>\
which the food and drink pass, and by which they<br>\
enter: (TA;) pl. [of pauc.] أَمْرِئَةٌ (K) and [of<br>\
mult.] مُرُؤٌ. (S, K.) It is also written مَرِىٌّ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  يَأْتِينا فِى مِثْلِ مَرِىْءِ النَّعَامِ [It comes to<br>\
us as it were through the gullet of the ostrich]: a<br>\
proverbial expression, from a trad., alluding to<br>\
paucity of food; the ostrich being particularized<br>\
because of the slenderness of its neck, whence is<br>\
inferred the narrowness of its gullet. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Wholesome, &amp;c. (See مَرُؤَ.) ―<br>\
-b4-  هَنِيْئًا مَرِيْئًا: see<br>\
