(K,) He, or it (a thing, Msb, TA), was, or<br>\
became, or drew, near. (Msb, K.) And hence,<br>\
(TA,) حَبَوْتُ لِلْخَمْسِينَ I was, or became, or<br>\
drew, near to fifty [years]; (S, ISd, TA;) [as<br>\
also حبوت الخَمْسِينَ; for] IAar says that حَبَاهَا<br>\
and حَبَا لَهَا both have this signification. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  حَبَتِ الأَضْلَاعُ إِلَى الصُّلْبِ The ribs joined to<br>\
the backbone; (K;) and in like manner, with<br>\
the same meaning, one says of the entrails: and<br>\
the ribs were near to the backbone. (TA.) And<br>\
حَبَتِ الشَّرَاسِيفُ, (K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,)<br>\
i. e. [The extremities of the ribs, projecting over<br>\
the belly,] were long, so that they were near one<br>\
another. (K.) And حَبَا المَسِيلُ The water-course,<br>\
or channel of a torrent, became [contracted,] so<br>\
that one part thereof was near to another. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  حَبَا, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. يَحْبُو, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. حَبْوٌ, said of a child, (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K,) before he stands; (Lth, TA;) as also حَبَى,<br>\
aor. يَحْبِى, inf. n. حَبْىٌ, which, however, is rare;<br>\
(Msb;) He crept, or crawled, [or dragged himself along,] upon his posteriors; (Mgh;) or so<br>\
حبا عَلَى اسْتِهِ: (S:) or he went along upon his<br>\
posteriors, protruding his chest: (K:) or went<br>\
along on four [or, as we say, on all fours]: in this<br>\
last sense it is used by the lawyers. (Mgh.) And,<br>\
said of a man, He went along upon his hands, or<br>\
arms, and his belly: (K:) or upon his hands, or<br>\
arms, and his knees: or upon his posteriors: or<br>\
upon his elbows and knees: (TA:) [or he crept, or<br>\
crawled: for] you say, مَا جَآءَ إِلَّا حَبْوًا, meaning<br>\
He came not save creeping, or crawling: and<br>\
مَانَجَافُلَانٌ إِلَّا حَبْوًا [Such a one escaped not<br>\
save creeping, or crawling]. (TA.) Also, said<br>\
of a camel having his fore shank bound up to his<br>\
arm, He crept, or crawled, along: [or he dragged<br>\
himself along on the ground:] and, said of a<br>\
camel, he lay down, and crept, or crawled, [or<br>\
dragged himself along,] by reason of fatigue:<br>\
or, as some say, being constrained to ascend a<br>\
difficult tract of sand, he protruded his chest,<br>\
and then crept, or crawled. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
said of an arrow, It glided along the ground,<br>\
and then hit the butt: (S:) or so حبا إِلَى الغَرَضِ.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And حبا المَالُ, (K,) inf. n. حَبْوٌ, (TA,)<br>\
The cattle clave to the ground, motionless, by<br>\
reason of emaciation. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And حَبَتِ السَّفِينَةُ,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. حَبْوٌ, (TA,) The ship ran. (K.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
حَبَا لَهُ It (a thing) presented itself, or its breadth,<br>\
or width, or its side, to him, or it; syn. اِعْتَرَضَ,<br>\
(K,) or عَرَضَ; (Mgh;) as do, for instance,<br>\
waves to a ship; (TA;) and as clouds, like a<br>\
mountain, before they cover the sky. (S.) And<br>\
حبا الرَّمْلُ, aor. يَحْبُو, inf. n. حَبْوٌ, The sands rose<br>\
up, extending sideways (مُعْتَرِضًا): (TA:) or extended widely. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
-A4-  حَبَاهُ, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
aor. as above, (TA,) inf. n. حَبْوٌ (TA) and حَبْوَةٌ,<br>\
(S, TA,) or this is a simple subst, (K,) and the<br>\
inf. n. is حِبَآءٌ, (Msb,) or this last also is a simple<br>\
subst., (S, * K,) He gave him (S, Msb, K) a thing<br>\
(Msb) without any compensation (Msb, K) and<br>\
without [receiving] any favour, or benefit: or<br>\
in a general sense. (K. [See also حِبَآءٌ below.])<br>\
You say, حَبَاهُ كَذَا and بِكَذَا He (God, or a<br>\
man,) gave him such a thing without [receiving]<br>\
any favour, or benefit, and without requital.<br>\
(Ham pp. 327 and 654.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And also, (K,) aor.<br>\
as above, inf. n. حِبَآءٌ, (TA,) He denied him,<br>\
refused him, or refused to give him; (K, TA;)<br>\
on the authority of IAar only. (TA.) Thus<br>\
the verb bears two contr. significations. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  حبا مَا حَوْلَهُ He defended, protected, or<br>\
guarded, what was around him; (As, S, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ حبّاهُ, inf. n. تَحْبِيَةٌ. (S, K.) J cites as<br>\
an ex. of the former verb, from a poem of Ibn-Ahmar, the phrase لَمْ يَحْبُهَا فَحْلٌ [as though<br>\
meaning A stallion did not defend them]; referring to she-camels: but accord. to AHn, it means<br>\
did not regard them; being occupied with himself. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  You say also, فُلَانٌ يَحْبُو قَصَاهُمْ<br>\
and يَحُوطُ قَصَاهُمْ [Such a one fights in their<br>\
defence; or defends them in a distant quarter:<br>\
but generally meant ironically: see 1 in art.<br>\
حوط]: both signify the same. (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
حَبَّوَ see 1.<br>\
3<br>\
حاباهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. مُحَابَاةٌ (Msb, K,<br>\
KL) and حِبَآءٌ, (K,) He vied, or contended, with<br>\
him in giving. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He aided him, or<br>\
assisted him: he treated him, or behaved towards<br>\
him, with partiality; was partial towards him:<br>\
and inclined towards him: (K:) he treated<br>\
him in an easy and a gentle manner. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  حاباهُ فِى البَيْعِ, (S, MA,) inf. n. مُحَابَاةٌ, (S,<br>\
Mgh, KL,) He abated the price, or payment, to<br>\
him in selling: (MA, KL, PS:) or he treated<br>\
him in an easy and a gentle manner therein:<br>\
(TK:) from حِبَآءٌ signifying “ a gift. ” (Mgh.)<br>\
4<br>\
رَمَى فَأَحْبَى He shot, and made his arrow<br>\
to fall short of the butt (IAar, K) and then to<br>\
leap so as to hit the butt. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَحَبَّوَ see what next follows.<br>\
8<br>\
احتبى He drew together and confined his<br>\
back and his shanks (S, Mgh, Msb, and Har<br>\
p. 179) with his رِدَآء, (S,) or with a garment,<br>\
or piece of cloth, or with some other thing, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, and Har ubi suprà,) when sitting, to be like<br>\
him who is leaning [his back against a wall]:<br>\
(Har ubi suprà:) he drew his legs against his<br>\
belly with a garment, or piece of cloth, confining<br>\
them therewith, together with his back, and binding it, or making it tight, upon them, so as to<br>\
preserve him from falling, [when he sat,] like a<br>\
wall: (IAth, TA:) and ↓ تحبّى signifies the<br>\
same: (TA:) or احتبى بِالثَّوْبِ he inwrapped<br>\
himself with the garment: or he drew together<br>\
and confined his back and his shanks with a turban<br>\
or the like: (K:) for the Arabs not having walls<br>\
in their deserts to lean against in their assembling,<br>\
the man used to set up his knees in his sitting,<br>\
and put against them a sword, or surround them<br>\
[and his back] with a piece of cloth, or knit his<br>\
hands, or arms, together upon them, and rest<br>\
against them; this standing him in stead of leaning. (Har ubi suprà.) The doing this in one<br>\
garment is forbidden, in a trad., lest, by accident,<br>\
what decency requires to be concealed should<br>\
become exposed. (IAth, TA.) You say also, احتبى<br>\
بِيَدَيْهِ [He confined his legs against his belly with his<br>\
hands, or arms, in sitting, to support himself by<br>\
so doing]. (S, Msb. *) [See also قُرْفُصَآءُ.] الاِحْتِبَآءُ<br>\
with the sword is practised on the occasions of<br>\
making a covenant for mutual protection, or war,<br>\
or appointing a chief, and the like; because the<br>\
sword may be wanted in these cases. (Ham<br>\
p. 711.)<br>\
حَبًا: see حَبِىٌّ.<br>\
حُبَةٌ A grape: (K:) or grapes when they first<br>\
grow, from the berry, not from planting: (TA:)<br>\
pl. حُبًى. (K.)<br>\
حَبْوَةٌ: see حِبَآءٌ.<br>\
حُبْوَةٌ a subst. from اِحْتَبَى, (Yaakoob, S, K,)<br>\
as also ↓ حِبْوَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and حِبْيَةٌ (K) and<br>\
↓ حِبَآءُ and ↓ حُبَآءٌ: (Ks, K:) meaning [The act<br>\
denoted by اِحْتَبَى; i. e. اِحْتِبَآءٌ: and also] a<br>\
turban, or piece of cloth, or some other thing<br>\
with which a man performs what is termed<br>\
الاِحْتِبَآءُ: (Har p. 179:) pl. حُبًى (Yaakoob, TA)<br>\
and حِبًى. (Yaakoob, S, TA.) [See an ex. from<br>\
a trad. voce نَمِرَةٌ: and see also a verse of<br>\
El-Farezdak cited voce حَلَّ.] Hence, حَلَّ حُبْوَتَهُ<br>\
and عَقَدَ حُبْوَتَهُ mean (assumed tropical:)  He rose, or stood up,<br>\
and (assumed tropical:)  He sat. (Har p. 179. The former phrase<br>\
is also mentioned in the S.) And the saying,<br>\
الحُبَى حِيطَانُ العَرَبِ [The things used for the<br>\
purpose of اِحْتِبَآء are the walls of the Arabs:<br>\
see 8]. (TA.) And the saying, in a trad. of ElAhnaf (when he was asked in a time of war,<br>\
“ When is forbearance? ”), ↓ عِنْدِ الحُبَآءِ [On the<br>\
occasion of اِحْتِبَآء]; meaning that forbearance is<br>\
to be approved in peace, not in war. (TA.)<br>\
الحبوة on Friday, when the Imám is reciting the<br>\
khutbeh, is forbidden; because الاِحْتِبَآء induces<br>\
sleep, and exposes the purity of the worshipper<br>\
to be annulled. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also حِبَآءٌ.<br>\
حِبْوَةٌ: see حُبْوَةٌ:<br>\

حِبَآءٌ (S, Mgh, K) a subst. from حَبَاهُ “ he gave<br>\
him without any compensation ” &amp;c., (K,) as also<br>\

all held by Lh to be inf. ns.: (TA:) or meaning<br>\
A gift. (S, Mgh.) And the first, The dowry of<br>\
a woman or wife. (TA.)<br>\

-b2-  Also A collection of clouds;<br>\
syn. سَحَابٌ; because it creeps along; or from<br>\
حَبَا meaning عَرَضَ, wherefore it is also called<br>\
عَارِضٌ: (Mgh:) or applied to a collection of<br>\
clouds as meaning that presents itself, or its<br>\
breadth, or width, or its side, or extends sideways,<br>\
(S, Ham p. 785, and EM p. 51,) heaped up,<br>\
(EM,) in the tracts of the horizon, (Ham,) like<br>\
a mountain, before it covers the sky; (S, EM;)<br>\
as also ↓ حَبًا; (S;) so called because near to the<br>\
earth, (S, Ham,) as though creeping, or crawling,<br>\
like a child; or from حَبَا; like as سَحَابٌ is from<br>\
سَحَبَ, (Ham,) or from سَحَبَ أَهْدَابَهُ: (TA:) or,<br>\
as also ↓ حُبِىٌّ, a collection of clouds overpeering<br>\
(يُشْرِفُ, in [some of] the copies of the K, erroneously, يشرق, TA) from the horizon upon the<br>\
earth: or heaped up, one part above another.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
حُبِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
حَابٍ Near; applied to thing of any kind.<br>\
(S.) [Hence,] حَابِى الحُيُودِ Having the heads of<br>\
the ribs connected [by means of the cartilages],<br>\
one with another. (Az, TA.) And إِنَّهُ لَحَابِى<br>\
الشَّرَاسِيفِ Verily he is protuberant in the two sides.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\

likewise to a camel. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  An arrow that<br>\
creeps along (Kt, K) upon the ground (Kt) to the<br>\
butt, (Kt, K,) having fallen short of it: (Kt:)<br>\
or an arrow that glides along the ground, and<br>\
then hits the butt: pl. حَوَابٍ. (Msb.) Hence the<br>\
saying, in a trad., إِنَّ حَابِيًا خَيْرٌ مِنْ زَاهِقٍ, i. e. An<br>\
arrow such as is termed حَابٍ, though weak,<br>\
having hit the butt, is better than one that goes<br>\
beyond the butt by its vehemence of passage,<br>\
and its force, not having hit it: meaning, by the<br>\
two arrows, one who attains the truth, or right,<br>\
or a part thereof, though weak; and another who<br>\
goes beyond it, and far from it, though strong.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  A thing presenting itself, or its breadth,<br>\
or width, or its side; as also ↓ حَبِىٌّ; (K;) as in<br>\
the saying of El-&#39;Ajjáj, describing a [vessel such<br>\
as is called] قُرْقُور,<br>\
فَهْوَ إِذَا حَبَا لَهُ حَبِىُّ<br>\
i. e. [So it,] when waves present themselves, or<br>\
their breadth, &amp;c., to it. (TA.) [Hence,] رَمَلٌ<br>\
