حَضَّهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
حَضُ3َ, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
حَضٌّ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ حُضٌّ, (IDrd, K,) or this<br>\
latter is a simple subst., (S, K,) and ↓ حِضِّيضَى,<br>\
(K,) or this also is a simple subst., (S, TA,) and<br>\
↓ حُضِّيضَى, (K,) or this also is a simple subst.,<br>\
and is the only instance of the measure فُعِّيلَى;<br>\
and of these last two, the former is the more<br>\
approved; (TA;) [both of these, accord. to<br>\
some, have an intensive signification;] He excited, incited, urged, or instigated, him; syn.<br>\
حَثَّهُ; (T, S, A, K;) or حَمَلَهُ; (Msb;) and roused<br>\
him to ardour; (K;) عَلَيْهِ to do it; (K;) i. e.<br>\
عَلَى الأَمْرِ to do the thing; (Msb;) or عَلَى الخَيْرِ<br>\
to do good; (T, A;) or عَلَى القِتَال to fight;<br>\
(S;) or it is used as relating to pace, and to<br>\
driving, and to any other thing; (M, TA;) and<br>\
El-Hareeree says, on the authority of Kh, that<br>\
حَثَّهُ is used peculiarly in relation to pace, or<br>\
journeying, or marching: (TA in art. حث:)<br>\
and ↓ حضّضهُ, (T, S, K,) inf. n. تَحْضِيضٌ, (T,<br>\
Msb,) signifies the same; (K;) or has a more<br>\
intensive signification; (Msb;) or i. q. حَرَّضَهُ<br>\
[which is equivalent to حَثَّهُ with the addition<br>\
given above from the K]; (T, S;) and this is<br>\
used as relating to fighting: (T, TA:) or تَحْضِيضٌ<br>\
signifies the asking, or requiring, with urgency.<br>\
(Mughnee voce أَلَا.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[lxxxix. 19], accord. to the reading of the people<br>\
of El-Medeeneh, وَلَا يَحُضُّونَ عَلَى طَعَامِ المِسْكينِ;<br>\
and accord. to that of El-Hasan, تَحُضُّونَ; [Nor<br>\
do they, or ye, excite one another to feed the<br>\
poor, or destitute]: (TA:) or nor do they, or<br>\
ye, command to feed the poor, &amp;c.: (Fr, TA:)<br>\
and there are other readings thereof: see 3 and 6.<br>\
(TA.) The grammarians apply to the particles<br>\
هَلَّا and أَلَّا and لَوْلَا and لَوْمَا the term حُرُوفُ<br>\
↓ التَّحْضِيضِ [Particles of exciting]; and say that<br>\
when they are followed by a future, they denote<br>\
exciting to an action, and seeking or desiring or<br>\
demanding the performance of it; and when followed by a preterite, reproof for not doing<br>\
a thing. (Msb.)<br>\

حضّضهُ, inf. n. تَحْضِيضٌ: see 1, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
3<br>\
حاضّهُ, (TK,) inf. n. مُحَاضَّةٌ, (S, K,) He<br>\
excited him, &amp;c., as above, being excited, &amp;c.,<br>\
by him. (S, K, TK.) In the Kur ubi suprà,<br>\
among the various readings are these two: وَلَا<br>\
يُحَاضُّونَ and ولا تُحَاضُّونَ, meaning, accord. to<br>\
Fr, Nor are they, or ye, mindful. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تحاضّوا They excited, &amp;c., one another.<br>\
(S, K.) In the Kur ubi suprà, some read وَلَا<br>\
تَحَاضُّونَ (Fr, S, TA) Nor do ye excite one another.<br>\
(Fr.)<br>\
حُضٌّ, said to be a subst.: see 1.<br>\
حَضِيضٌ A depressed piece (قَرَار) of ground at<br>\
the place where a mountain ends; (S;) or a depressed piece (قرار) of ground at, or by, the سَفْح<br>\
[i. e. foot, or bottom, or lowest part,] of a mountain; or in, or at, the lower, or lowest, part<br>\
thereof, (فِى أَسْفَلِهِ,) the سفح being behind the<br>\
حضيض; the حضيض being in the part next the<br>\
سفح, and the سفح being دُونَ ذٰلِكَ [which seems<br>\
to be virtually a repetition, signifying behind that<br>\
part, or it may mean above that part]: (TA:)<br>\
or i. q. سَفْحٌ: (K in art. سفح:) or a depressed<br>\
piece (قرار) of ground: (A:) or a tract (حِجزٌ<br>\
[in the CK, erroneously, حَجَر]), and a depressed<br>\
piece (قرار), in land or ground: (K:) and any<br>\
low piece (سَافِلٌ) of land or ground: (TA:) and<br>\
the ground [in an absolute sense]: (S:) pl. [of<br>\
pauc.] أَحِضَّةٌ and [of mult.] حُضُضٌ. (K.) It<br>\
has the last of the above-mentioned significations<br>\
in a certain trad., in which it is related that a<br>\
present being brought to Mohammad, he, not<br>\
finding anything upon which to put it, said, ضَعْهُ<br>\
بِالحَضِيضِ, meaning بِالأَرْضِ; [i. e. Put thou it<br>\
upon the ground;] adding, for I am only a servant; I eat as the servant eateth. (S.)<br>\
حِضِّيضَى and حُضِّيضَى, said to be substs.: see 1.<br>\
