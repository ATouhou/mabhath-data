حَنْظَلَتِ الشَّجَرَةُ The tree became bitter<br>\
in its fruit [like the حَنْظَل]. (AHei, TA.)<br>\
حَنْظَلٌ [The colocynth; cucumis colocynthis;]<br>\
a certain bitter plant; (Msb;) [and its fruit;]<br>\
well known; (K;) i. q. شَرْىٌ: (S:) n. un. with ة:<br>\
(S, Msb, K: *) [accord. to Freytag (who refers to<br>\
Avic. p. 175, and Sprengel. hist. rei herb. vol. i.<br>\
p. 269,) applied also to the momordica elaterium,<br>\
or cucumis prophetarum:] there is a male species,<br>\
and a female; the former fibrous; the latter soft,<br>\
or easily broken, white, and easy to swallow:<br>\
(TA:) the choice sort of it is the yellow; (K;)<br>\
or, accord. to the “ Kánoon ” of the Ra-ees [Ibn-Seenà, from which the description of its properties<br>\
and uses, in the K and TA, is, with some slight<br>\
variations, taken], the white, very white, and<br>\
soft; for the black and the hard are bad, and it<br>\
is not plucked until it becomes yellow, and the<br>\
greenness has completely gone from it; (TA:)<br>\
its pulp attenuates the thick phlegmatic humour<br>\
that flows upon the joints (K, TA) and tendons,<br>\
(TA,) when swallowed (K, TA) in the dose of<br>\
of twelve keeráts, (TA,) or used in the manner of<br>\
a cluster: it is beneficial for melancholy, and<br>\
epilepsy, and the [sort of doting termed] وَسْوَاس,<br>\
and alopecia (دَآء الثَّعْلَب), and elephantiasis<br>\
(الجُذَام), (K, TA,) and [the disease of the tumid<br>\
leg, termed] دَآء الفِيل; for these three used by<br>\
rubbing; and for the cold نِقْرِس [i. e. arthritis,<br>\
or gout], (TA,) and for the bite of vipers, and the<br>\
sting of scorpions, especially its root; (K, TA;)<br>\
for this last being the most beneficial of medicines; a drachm of its root, administered to an<br>\
Arab stung by a scorpion in four places, being<br>\
said to have cured him on the spot: that which is<br>\
plucked green relaxes [the bowels] excessively, and<br>\
produces excessive vomiting: so in the “ Kánoon: ”<br>\
(TA:) it is also beneficial for the tooth-ache, by<br>\
fumigating with its seeds; and for killing fleas,<br>\
by sprinkling what is cooked thereof; and for the<br>\
sciatica, by rubbing with what is green thereof:<br>\
(K, TA:) its root is cooked with vinegar, and<br>\
one rinses the mouth with it for the tooth-ache;<br>\
and the vinegar is cooked in it in hot ashes: when<br>\
cooked in olive-oil, that oil, being dropped [into<br>\
the ear-hole], is beneficial for ringing in the ears:<br>\
it is beneficial also for the moist and flatulent<br>\
colic: and sometimes it attenuates the blood: administered as a suppository in the vagina, it kills<br>\
the fœtus: (TA:) when the plant bears a single<br>\
fruit, this is very deadly. (K, TA.) [See also<br>\
هَبِيدٌ.] Accord. to [many of] the leading authorities among the Arabs, (TA,) the ن in this<br>\
word is augmentative; (Msb, TA;) because of<br>\
their saying, حَظِلَ البَعِيرُ, meaning “ the camel<br>\
became sick from eating حَنْظَل; ” and J and Sgh<br>\
[and Fei and others] have mentioned it in art.<br>\
حظل: but ISd says that this is not an evidence<br>\
of its being radically triliteral; and that حَظِلَ is<br>\
like ضَغْبَةٌ (as an epithet applied to a woman)<br>\
from الضَّغَابِيسُ, which must be acknowledged to<br>\
be radically quadriliteral. (TA.)<br>\
