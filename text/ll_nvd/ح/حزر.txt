K) and مَحْزَرَةٌ, (Th, K,) He computed, or determined, its quantity, measure, size, bulk, proportion, extent, amount, sum, or number: (S, Mgh, *<br>\
Msb, K:) [more commonly,] he computed by<br>\
conjecture its quantity or measure &amp;c.; syn.<br>\
خَرَصَهُ, (S, K,) and قَدَّرَهُ بِالحَدْسِ; (M;) he took<br>\
its quantity or measure &amp;c. by the eye. (TK.)<br>\
[He conjectured it; and so ↓ حزّرهُ, inf. n. تَحْزِيرٌ:<br>\
perhaps post-classical: whence عِلْمُ التَّحْزِيرِ The<br>\
science of divination.] You say, حَزَرَ النَّخْلِ He<br>\
computed by conjecture the quantity of the fruit<br>\
upon the palm-trees. (A, Msb.) And حَزَرْتُ قِرَاءَتَهُ<br>\
عِشْرِينَ آيَةً (tropical:)  I computed his recitation, or reading,<br>\
to be twenty verses [of the Kur-án]. (A.) And<br>\
حَزَرْتُ فُدُومَهُ يَوْمَ كَذَا (tropical:)  I computed his arrival<br>\
to be on such a day. (A.) And اِحْزِرْ نَفْسِكَ هَلْ<br>\
تَقْدِرُ عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  Measure thyself, whether thou be able<br>\
to do it. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  حَزَرَ, (S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
حَزُرَ, inf. n.<br>\
حَزْرٌ and حُزُورٌ, (M,) It (milk, S, M, K, and<br>\
beverage of the kind called نَبِيذ, S, K) became<br>\
sour, or acid. (S, M, K.) It is said in a prov.,<br>\
عَدَا القَارِصُ فَحَزَرَ [explained in art. قرص]. (A.)<br>\

-b2-  Hence, (TA,) (tropical:)  It (a man&#39;s face) was, or<br>\
became, [sour, i. e.] frowning, contracted, stern,<br>\
austere, or morose. (K, TA.)<br>\

حَزْرَةُ المَالِ The better, or best, of cattle or other<br>\
property; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also ↓ حَزِيرَةُ<br>\
المالِ: or the latter signifies property to which<br>\
the heart clings: (TA:) the term حزرة is applied<br>\
alike to what is masc. and what is fem.: (AO,<br>\
Msb:) the pl. is حَزَرَاتٌ (S, Msb, K) and حَزْرَاتٌ,<br>\
as though the sing. were an epithet: (Msb:) it<br>\
is applied to the better or best of property because<br>\
the owner of such property always, when he sees<br>\
it, computes its quantity or number in his mind:<br>\
accord. to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, حَزَرَاتُ الأَمْوَالِ signifies<br>\
those kinds of property which their owners love:<br>\
accord. to AO, choice kinds of property. (TA.)<br>\
You say also, هٰذَا حَزْرَةُ نَفْسِى, meaning This is<br>\
the best of what I have: and of such property<br>\
the collector of the poor-rate is forbidden to take.<br>\
(S, Mgh, * TA.) Also, هِىَ حَزْرَةُ قَلْبِهِ It is the<br>\
choice thing of his heart. (AO.)<br>\
حَزْرَآءٌ Sour [milk such as is termed] صَرْبَة.<br>\

thinks to be a mistake for صربة. See also حَازِرٌ.])<br>\

of puberty, and has become strong: (Mgh, TA,<br>\
in explanation of the latter word:) or a boy who<br>\
has nearly attained the age of puberty; so called,<br>\
accord. to several authors, as being likened to a<br>\
hill: or one who has fully attained that age:<br>\
(TA:) or, accord. to As and El-Mufaddal, a<br>\
young boy, who has not attained the age of<br>\
puberty: and sometimes, one who has attained<br>\
that age, and become strong in body, and has<br>\
borne arms: and this is the right explanation:<br>\
(Az:) and a strong man: and, contr., a weak<br>\
man: (AHát, K:) or, accord. to some of the<br>\
lexicologists, when applied to a boy, or young<br>\
man, it signifies strong: and when applied to an<br>\
old man, weak: (Abu-t-Teiyib:) pl. حَزَاوِرَةٌ (S,<br>\
