aor.<br>\
حَرَ3َ, inf. n. حِرَّةٌ [perhaps a mistake for حَرَّةٌ]<br>\
and حَرَارَةٌ: [app. in the same sense:] ISd says,<br>\
I think he means [from] الحَرُّ, not الحُرِّيَّةُ. (TA.)<br>\
And حَرَرٌ [an inf. n. of the same verb] signifies<br>\
The liver&#39;s becoming dry from thirst or grief.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  حَرَّ, sec. pers. حَرِرْتَ, aor.<br>\

-A4-  حَرَّ, aor.<br>\
حَرِ3َ, He cooked [what is<br>\

-A2-  Also He (God) made<br>\

thirsty; as in the saying, used by the Arabs in<br>\
cursing a man, مَا لَهُ أَحَرَّ اللّٰهُ صَدْرَهُ [What aileth<br>\
him? May God make his bosom thirsty]: or the<br>\
meaning is هَامَتَهُ [app. here used as signifying the<br>\
bird called هَامَة, in the form of which the soul<br>\
was believed to issue from a slain man, and to<br>\
call incessantly for drink until the slaughter of the<br>\

حِرِىٌّ: see art. حرح.<br>\
حَرٌّ Heat; contr. of بَرْدٌ; (S, A, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ حَرَارَةٌ, (S, * Msb, * K,) contr. of<br>\
بُرُودَةٌ; (S;) and ↓ حُرُورٌ (S, * Msb, * K) and ↓ حِرَّةٌ:<br>\
(TA:) [see 1, first sentence:] pl. [of the first]<br>\
حُرُورٌ and ↓ أَحَارِرُ; (K;) the latter anomalous,<br>\
both as to its measure and in the non-incorporation of the first ر into the second: it is mentioned on the authority of AZ and others; but<br>\
IDrd doubts its correctness; and the author of<br>\
the Wá&#39;ee mentions أَحَارُّ as a pl. form, but apparently to avoid contrariety to rule: the pl. of<br>\
↓ حَرَارَةٌ as a simple subst., or as an inf. n., but<br>\
more probably as the former, is حَرَارَاتٌ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A burning of the heart, from pain and<br>\
wrath and distress or affliction or trouble or fatigue. (TA.) [See also حَرَارَةٌ.] ―<br>\

Msb, K:) pl. masc. أَحْرَارٌ (Msb, K) and حِرَارٌ;<br>\
(IJ, K;) not حَرَارٌ, as some say; nor is حِرَارٌ an<br>\
inf. n. as well as a pl., as others say: (MF:)<br>\
pl. fem. حَرَائِرُ, (Msb, K,) contr. to analogy, and,<br>\
as Suh says, the only instance of the kind except<br>\
شَجَرٌ مَرَائِرُ as pl. of شَجَرَةٌ مُرَّةٌ; for the [regular]<br>\
pl. of فُعْلَةٌ is فْعَلٌ; but حُرَّةٌ has this form of pl.<br>\
because it is syn. with كَرِيمَةٌ and عَقِيلَةٌ [as will<br>\
be seen in what follows]; and مُرَّةٌ, because it<br>\
means خَبِيثَةُ الطَّعْمِ. (Msb.) Omar said to the<br>\
women who used to go forth to the mosque,<br>\
لَأَرُدَّنَّكْنَّ حَرَائِرَ [lit. I will assuredly make you to<br>\
become free women]; meaning I will assuredly<br>\

lowered before free women; not before slavewomen. (TA.) [See also حُرِّيَّةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  Generous,<br>\
noble, or well-born; like as عَبْدٌ is used to signify<br>\
“ ignoble,” or “ base-born: ” (Mgh:) and so the<br>\
fem. حُرَّةٌ; (S, Mgh, K;) applied to a woman;<br>\
(TA;) and to a she-camel: (S:) and so the<br>\
masc. applied to a horse. (K, TA.) [Hence,]<br>\
بَاتَتْ بِلَيْلَةِ حُرَّةٍ (tropical:)  [She passed a virgin&#39;s night] is<br>\
said of her whose husband has not been able to<br>\
devirginate her (S, A, K) in the night when she<br>\
has been first brought to him: (TA:) because<br>\
the حُرَّة is modest and repugnant: (Har p. 418:)<br>\
in the contr. case one says, بِلَيْلَةِ شَيْبَآءَ: (S, L:)<br>\
and one says also بِلَيْلَةٍ حُرَّةٍ; and بِلَيْلَةٍ شَيْبَآءَ.<br>\
(TA.) [And hence,] لَيْلَةُ حُرَّة and لَيْلَةٌ حُرَّةٌ signify also (assumed tropical:)  The first night of the [lunar] month:<br>\
(K:) its last night is called لَيْلَةُ شَيْبَآءَ and لَيْلَةٌ<br>\
شَيْبَآءُ. (TA.) You say also وَجْهٌ حُرٌّ (tropical:)  [app. meaning An ingenuous countenance]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  Generous, or ingenuous, in conduct: as in the saying<br>\
of Imra-el-Keys,<br>\
لَعَمْرُكَ مَا قَلْبِى إِلَى أَهْلِهِ بِحْرْ<br>\
[By thy life, my heart is not generous in conduct<br>\
to its, or his, companion]; meaning that it is<br>\
averse therefrom, and inclines to another. (Az,<br>\
TA.) [Hence,] سَحَابَةٌ حُرَّةٌ (tropical:)  A cloud bountiful<br>\
with rain; (A;) or abounding with rain. (S,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  (tropical:)  A good deed or action. (K, TA.) You<br>\

of thee. (S, A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  Anything good, or excel-lent; as poetry, &amp;c. (TA.) You say كَلَامٌ حُرٌّ<br>\
(tropical:)  [app. meaning good, or excellent, speech or language]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b6-  (tropical:)  Good earth, or clay, and sand:<br>\
(K, TA:) or earth, or clay, in which is no sand:<br>\
(S, A:) and sand in which is no earth or clay:<br>\

or sand in which is no mixture of any other<br>\
thing: (Msb: [accord. to which, this is the<br>\
primary meaning of the word, whence the meaning of “ free,” i. e. the “ contr. of عَبْدٌ: ” but<br>\
accord. to the A and TA, it is tropical:]) and<br>\
أَرْضٌ حُرَّةٌ (tropical:)  land in which is no salt earth: (A:)<br>\
or in which is no sand: as applied to that upon<br>\
which no tithe is levied, it is post-classical. (Mgh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  (tropical:)  The middle, (S, A, K,) and best part, (TA,)<br>\
of sand, (S, K, TA,) and of a house. (S, A, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  (assumed tropical:)  The best of anything; (K, TA;) as, for instance, of fruit. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  Also sing. of أَحْرَار in the<br>\
term أَحْرَارُ البُقُولِ, (TA,) which means (tropical:)  Herbs,<br>\
or leguminous plants, that are eaten without being<br>\
cooked; (S, A;) as also البُقُولِ ↓ حُرِّيَّةُ: (A:) or<br>\
such as are slender and succulent; and ذُكُورُ<br>\
البُقُولِ means “ such as are thick and rough: ”<br>\
(AHeyth:) or the former are such as are slender<br>\
and soft; and the latter, “such as are hard and<br>\
thick: ” (TA in art. عشب:) or the former are<br>\
such as are slender and sweet; and the latter,<br>\
“ such as are thick, and inclining to bitterness: ”<br>\
(TA in art. ذكر:) or the former are such as are<br>\
rough; and these are three, namely, النَّفَلُ and<br>\
الحُرْبُثُ and القَفْعَآءُ: or الحُرُّ is applied to a plant<br>\
of the kind called النَّجِيل, growing in salt grounds.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  حُرُّ الوَجْهِ (tropical:)  What appears of the face:<br>\
(K, TA:) or what appears of the elevated part<br>\

↓ الحُرَّةُ signifies [the same, or] the elevated part<br>\
of the cheek: (TA:) or the former is what fronts<br>\
one, of the face: or the four tracks of the tears,<br>\
from each corner of each eye. (TA.) One says,<br>\
لَطَمَهُ عَلَى حُرِّ وَجْهِهِ (tropical:)  [He slapped him on the ball<br>\

-A2-  The young one of a<br>\
gazelle. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The young one of a serpent:<br>\

white serpent: or a serpent, absolutely. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  The young one of a pigeon: (S, K:) or the<br>\
male thereof. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  سَاقُ حُرٍّ [is said to signify] The male of the قَمَارِىّ [or kind of collared<br>\
turtle-doves of which the female is called قُمْرِيَّة<br>\
(see قُمْرِىٌّ)]: (S, Msb, K:) Homeyd Ibn-Thowr<br>\
says,<br>\
وَمَا هَاجَ هٰذَا الشَّوْقَ إِلَّا حَمَامَةٌ<br>\
دَعَتْ سَاقَ حُرٍّ تَرْحَةً وَتَرَنُّمَا<br>\
[And nothing excited this desire but a pigeon (see<br>\
حَمَامٌ) that called ساق حرّ, sorrowing and warbling]: or, accord. to IJ, the right reading is<br>\
دَعَتْ سَاقَ حُرٍّ فِى حَمَامٍ تَرَنُّمَا<br>\
[that called ساق حرّ among other pigeons, warbling]: but some say that الساق is the pigeon; and<br>\
حرّ, its young one: or ساق حرّ is the cry of the<br>\
قمارىّ, and is an onomatopœia: accord. to Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Adnán, it is ↓ ساق حَرّ, and means the warbling<br>\
of the pigeon: and Sakhr El-Gheí makes it a<br>\
compound, and indecl.; using the phrase, تُنَادِى<br>\
سَاقَ حُرَّ [she calls ساق حرّ]: on which IJ observes, As says, ساق حرّ is thought to mean the<br>\
young one of the bird; but it is her cry: and he<br>\
(IJ) adds, the fact that the poet [Sakhr] does not<br>\
make it decl. is an evidence of the correctness of<br>\
the assertion of As; for, were it decl., he would<br>\
have said سَاقَ حُرٍّ if it consisted of two nouns<br>\
whereof the former was prefixed to the other so<br>\
as to govern it in the gen. case, or ساق حُرًّا if it<br>\
were a compound; as it is indeterminate: and its<br>\
being made decl. by Homeyd does not show it to<br>\
be not significant of a sound; for sometimes an<br>\
expression significant of a sound consists of two<br>\
nouns whereof the former is prefixed to the latter<br>\
so as to govern it in the gen. case, like خَازُ بَازٍ.<br>\
(M, MF, TA.)<br>\

as أَرْضٌ is, (Yoo,) and ↓ أَحَرُّونَ, (S, K,) as though<br>\
the sing. were أَحَرَّةٌ, (Yoo, Sb, S,) though this<br>\
sing. is not used; (Yoo;) or as though its sing.<br>\
were أَحَرُّ, accord. to Th, who app. means that<br>\

be said that it is with kesr [instead of fet-h<br>\

in form to قِرَّةٌ, with which it occurs. (S, K.)<br>\
One says, رَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ بِالحِرَّةِ تَحْتَ القِرَّةِ (A, K) May<br>\
God afflict him by thirst with cold: and بِالحِرَّةِ<br>\
وَالقِرَّةِ by thirst and cold. (TA.) And أَشَدُّ العَطَشِ<br>\
حِرَّةٌ عَلَى قِرَّةٍ The most severe of thirst is thirst<br>\
