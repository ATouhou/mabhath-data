(S;) the place of the تِكَّة: (K:) pl. حُجَزٌ (Msb,<br>\

[meaning, (assumed tropical:)  He laid hold of a means of obtaining<br>\
access, or nearness, to God]: said of Mohammad,<br>\
in a trad. (TA.) And هٰذَا كَلَامٌ آخِذٌ بَعْضُهُ<br>\
بِحُجَزِ بَعْضٍ (tropical:)  This is language disposed in regular<br>\
order, consecutively. (A, TA.) It is said in a<br>\
trad., إِنَّ الرَّحِمَ أَخَذَتْ بِحُجْزَةِ الرَّحمٰنِ [Verily<br>\
الرَّحِمُ is connected with الرَّحْمٰن]: said to mean,<br>\
that the name of الرحم is derived from الرحمن;<br>\
so that it is as though it attached itself thereto,<br>\
and laid hold of the middle thereof. (IAth, TA.)<br>\
حِجْزَةٌ A mode, manner, or form, of tying the<br>\
إِزَار. (TA.)<br>\

people; (S, A, K; and T in art. دول, on the<br>\
authority of IAar;) time after time: (K:) app.<br>\

partition, a fence, a barrier, or an obstacle, or<br>\
obstruction, between two other things, (TA,) or<br>\
between two things facing, or opposite to, each<br>\
other; (Az, A, TA;) as also ↓ حِجَازٌ. (Az, A,<br>\
TA.) Hence the province called El-Hijáz is thus<br>\
named, because it forms a separation between<br>\
Nejd and the Ghowr, or Ghór; (S, Mgh, TA;)<br>\
or between Nejd and the Saráh; (Msb, K;) or<br>\
between the Ghowr, or Ghór, and Syria (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA) and the Bádiyeh; (Mgh, TA;) or<br>\
between Nejd and Tihámeh; (K;) or because<br>\
the Hirár [or certain stony tracts] separate it<br>\
from the high part of Nejd; (Az, TA;) or because it is encompassed by the Hirár and the<br>\
mountains, (Mgh, Msb, *) or by the five Hirár,<br>\
namely, the Harrah of Benoo-Suleym and that of<br>\
Wákim and that of Leylà and that of Showrán<br>\
and that of En-Nár. (As, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also sing. of<br>\
حَجَزَةٌ, (K,) which latter signifies Wrongers, or<br>\
wrongdoers, who prevent one from obtaining his<br>\
right: (S:) or persons who defend men, one from<br>\
another, and decide between them justly. (Az,<br>\
TA.) In the K, the signification of “wrongers,<br>\
or wrongdoers,” is combined with the contrary<br>\
explanation given by Az. (TA.) It is said in a<br>\
trad. of Keyleh, أَيْعُجِزُ ابْنُ هٰذِهِ أَنْ يَنْتَصِفَ مِنْ<br>\
وَرَآءِ الحَجَزَةِ [Is the son of this woman unable to<br>\
obtain his right in the absence of the wrongdoers<br>\
who prevent his doing so?]: (S:) or [according<br>\
to one relation] أَيُلَامُ ابْنُ ذِهْ أَنْ يَفصِلَ الخُطَّةَ مِنْ<br>\
وَرَآءِ الحَجَزَة [Is the son of this woman to be<br>\
blamed for deciding the affair in the absence of<br>\
those who defend men, one from another, and<br>\
decide between them justly?]: by “the son of this<br>\
woman” she means her own son: she says, if he<br>\
suffer a wrong, and allege for himself that which<br>\
repels from him the wrong, [without having recourse to the judge,] he is not to be blamed.<br>\
(TA.) [See also خُطَّةٌ.]<br>\

the body] where the إِزَار is tied. (K.)<br>\
مُحْتَجَزٌ The place [or part of the body] where<br>\
the إِزِار is tied. (K.)<br>\
مُحْتَجِزٌ Having his waist bound [with the إِزَار]:<br>\
and with ة, a woman having her مِئْزَر bound upon<br>\
[that part of her person which is termed] the<br>\
