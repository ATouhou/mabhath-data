حَمُقَ; and حَمِقَ, aor.<br>\
حَمَقَ; (T, S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K, &amp;c.;) inf. n. (of the former, S) حَمَاقَةٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) or this is a simple subst., (Msb,) and (of<br>\
the latter, S) حُمْقٌ (S, Mgh, * Msb, * K) and حُمُقٌ;<br>\
(S; K;) He was, or became, foolish, or stupid; i. e.,<br>\
unsound in intellect or understanding; (T, Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) and stagnant, or dull, therein; (T, Mgh;)<br>\
or deficient, or defective, therein; (IF, Mgh;)<br>\
or he had little, or no, intellect or understanding;<br>\
(S, K;) as also ↓ انحمق and ↓ استحمق (K) and<br>\
↓ تحمّق. (TA.) [See حُمْقٌ, below.] One says to<br>\
a man, تِيسِى, and اِحْمَقِى, [as though he were a<br>\
she-hyena, or a woman,] when he speaks foolishly,<br>\
or stupidly, or says what is not like anything.<br>\
(AZ, TA voce تَاسَ.) ―<br>\
-b2-  حَمُقَتِ السُّوقُ, (S, M, K,)<br>\
with damm; (so in two copies of the S;) or, as<br>\
in [some copies of] the S, حَمِقَت; (TA;) and<br>\
↓ اِنْحَمَقَت; (S, Mgh, K;) (tropical:)  The market was, or<br>\
became, stagnant, or dull, with respect to traffic.<br>\
(S, M, Mgh, K, TA.) And حَمُقَتْ تِجَارَتُهُ (tropical:)  His<br>\
merchandise was, or became, unsaleable, or difficult of sale, or in little demand. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  حَمِقَ,<br>\

حَمَقَ, inf. n. حَمَقٌ, (tropical:)  His beard became light, or<br>\
scanty. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  حُمِقَ He had the disease<br>\
termed حُمَاق. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
حمّقهُ, inf. n. تَحْمِيقٌ, He ascribed to him<br>\
حُمْق [i. e. foolishness, or stupidity, &amp;c.]. (S, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  حَمَّقَتْهُ الهَجْعَةُ The light sleep in the first part<br>\
of the night rendered him like the أَحْمَق [i. e.<br>\
foolish, or stupid, &amp;c.]: so says IKh; and he<br>\
cites, from a poet, the phrase حَمَّقَتْهُ بِهَجْعَةٍ; in<br>\
which the ب is redundant, and the noun occupies<br>\
the place of one in the nom. case. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And<br>\
hence, if correct,] حُمِّقَ He drank wine: (K:) or<br>\
he became intoxicated, so that his reason departed:<br>\
thus explained by IAmb; but disallowed by EzZejjájee. (IB, TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
حامقهُ He aided him in his حُمْق [i. e. foolishness, or stupidity, &amp;c.]. (S.)<br>\
4<br>\
احمقهُ He found him to be أَحْمَق [i. e. fool<br>\
ish, or stupid, &amp;c.]. (S, K.) [See also 10.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
احمق بِهِ He mentioned him, or spoke of him, as<br>\

pidity, &amp;c.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  احمقت She (a woman)<br>\
brought forth a child that was أَحْمَق [i. e. foolish,<br>\
&amp;c.]; (S;) or brought forth حَمْقَى [i.e. foolish<br>\
children]. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  مَااحمقهُ [How foolish, or<br>\
stupid, &amp;c., is he!] an expression of wonder.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَحَمَّقَ see 1.<br>\
6<br>\
تحامق He affected حَمَاقَة [i. e. foolishness,<br>\
or stupidity, &amp;c.; meaning he feigned it]. (S.)<br>\
7<br>\
انحمق: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He acted in the<br>\
manner of the حَمْقَى [i. e. foolish, or stupid, &amp;c.];<br>\
(K;) and so ↓ استحمق. (Lth, T, Mgh, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
He (a man, TA) was, or became, abject, humble,<br>\
or submissive, (K, TA,) and impotent to do, or<br>\

10<br>\
استحمق: see 1: ―<br>\
-b2-  and 7.<br>\
-A2-  استحمقهُ<br>\
He counted, accounted, or esteemed, him احمقهُ<br>\
[i. e. foolish, or stupid, &amp;c.]: (S, Mgh, TA:) or<br>\
he found him to be so; like حُمْقٌ. (TA.)<br>\
حُمُقٌ Foolishness, or stupidity; i. e. unsoundness in the intellect or understanding; (T, Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) and stagnancy, or dulness, therein; (T,<br>\
Mgh;) or deficiency, or defectiveness, therein;<br>\
(IF, Mgh;) or paucity, or want, thereof; and<br>\
↓ حُمُقٌ and ↓ حَمَاقَةٌ signify the same: (S, K:)<br>\
[all are said to be inf. ns.; but the last, accord. to<br>\
the Msb, is a simple subst.: (see 1:)] the proper<br>\
and primary signification of حُمْقٌ is [said to be]<br>\
the putting a thing in a wrong place, with knowledge of its being bad [to do so]. (TA.) [Hence,]<br>\
نَوْمَةُ الحُمْقِ The sleep after [the period of the<br>\
afternoon called] the عَصْر; when no one sleeps<br>\
except one who is intoxicated, or one who is insane, or unsound in mind. (Har p. 223. [See<br>\
also خُرْقٌ and خُلُقٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Deceit; or a deception. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [It is said that] الحُمْقُ also<br>\
signifies Wine: (Z, K:) as being a cause of<br>\
حُمْق; like as wine is called إِثْمٌ as being a cause<br>\
of إِثْم: (Z, TA:) but Ez-Zejjájee disallows this:<br>\
and [it is also said that] ↓ الحُمَيْقَآءُ signifies the<br>\
same, because wine occasions حُمْق to its drinker.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
حَمِقٌ: see أَحْمَقُ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Having a scanty<br>\
beard. (IDrd, K.)<br>\
حُمُقٌ: see حُمْقٌ.<br>\
حَمْقَان: see أَحْمَقُ.<br>\
حُمَاقٌ (S, K) and حَمَاقٌ (ISd, K) and ↓ حُمَيْقَى<br>\
(AZ, K) and ↓ حُمَيْقَآءُ (IDrd, K) The جُدَرِىّ [or<br>\
small-pox]: (K:) or the like thereof, (S, K,)<br>\
which attacks a human being, (S,) and spreads in<br>\
a scattered manner upon the body, or person:<br>\
(K:) accord. to Lh, a certain thing that comes<br>\
forth upon children. (TA.)<br>\
حُمَيْقٌ a contracted dim. of أَحْمَقُ; or dim. of<br>\
حَمِقٌ: [the dim. form being app. used in this<br>\
case to denote enhancement of the signification:<br>\
(see also حُمَّيْقَةٌ:)] so in the prov., (TA,) عَرَفَ<br>\
حُمَيْقٌ جَمَلَهُ [A very foolish, or stupid, man knew<br>\
his camel]; i. e. he knew thus much, although<br>\
أَحْمَق: or, as some relate it, عَرَفَ حُمَيْقًا جَمَلُهْ,<br>\
i. e. his camel knew him, [namely, a very foolish,<br>\
or stupid, man,] and emboldened himself against<br>\
him; or it means that he knew his quality: (K,<br>\
TA:) it is applied to the case of excessive familiarity with men: (TA:) or to him who deems<br>\
a man weak, and is therefore fond of annoying,<br>\
or molesting, him, (K, TA,) and ceases not to act<br>\
wrongfully towards him: or, as some say, [حميق<br>\
is here a proper name; and] this person had a<br>\
camel with which he was familiar, and he made<br>\
and attack upon him. (TA.) [See Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov. ii. 85.]<br>\
حَمَاقَةٌ: see حُمْقٌ.<br>\
حُمُوقَةٌ: see أُحْمُوقَةٌ.<br>\
حُمَيْقَى: see حُمَاقٌ.<br>\
حُمَيْقَآءُ: see حُمْقٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and حُمَاقٌ.<br>\
حُمَيِّقَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
حَمُّوقَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
حُمَّيْقَةٌ, (K,) but in the Tekmileh with teshdeed<br>\
to the ى and with kesr to the same, [app.<br>\
↓ حُمَّيْقَةٌ,] (TA,) and ↓ حَمُّوقَةٌ, (K,) Foolish, or<br>\
stupid, (أَحْمَق,) in the utmost degree. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, K, TA.) [It seems to be implied in the<br>\
K that أُحْمُوقَةٌ signifies the same: but see this<br>\
word below.]<br>\
أَحْمَقُ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ حَمِقٌ (S,<br>\
Msb) and ↓ حَمْقَان [whether with or without<br>\
tenween is not shown] (Sb, TA) Foolish, or stupid; i. e. unsound in intellect or understanding;<br>\
(T, Mgh, Msb;) and stagnant, or dull, therein;<br>\
(T, Mgh;) or deficient, or defective, therein;<br>\
IF, Mgh;) or haring little, or no, intellect or<br>\
understanding: (S, K:) fem. of the first حَمْقَآءُ;<br>\
(S, Msb;) and of the second حَمِقَةٌ: (TA:) pl.<br>\
of the first, applied to men and to women, (S,<br>\
K,) حُمْقٌ, (so in two copies of the S,) or حُمُقٌ,<br>\
with two dammehs, (K,) and حَمْقَى and حَمَاقَى<br>\
(S, K) and حُمَاقَى (Sgh, K) and حِمَاقٌ. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, K.) Accord. to some, أَحْمَقُ is from the<br>\
phrase اِنْحَمَقَتِ السُّوقُ: and accord. to some, from<br>\
the phrase لَيَالٍ مُحْمِقَاتٌ, because the احمق deceives one at first by what he says. (TA.) The<br>\
sounds of wailing for the dead, and trilling, or<br>\
quavering, in playing, are termed أَحْمَقَانِ because<br>\
of the حُمْق of the person from whom they proceed. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  البَقْلَةُ الحَمْقَآءُ (S, K) and<br>\
بَقْلَةُ الحَمْقَآءِ, (K,) the latter for بَقْلَةُ الحَبَّةِ الحَمْقَآءِ,<br>\
i. q. الرِّجْلَةُ [Garden purslane]; (S, ISd, K;)<br>\
which is the name applied to it by the vulgar;<br>\
(ISd, TA;) the chief of herbs, or leguminous<br>\
plants: called by those names because exuding<br>\
mucilage (مُلَعِّبَةٌ), so that it is likened to the أَحْمَق<br>\
whose slaver is flowing: IDrd says, they assert<br>\
that it is so called because it grows in the tracks<br>\
of men, so that it is trodden upon; and in water-courses, so that the water uproots it: IF says<br>\
that it is so called because of its weakness: and<br>\
it is said that some persons, hating &#39;Áïsheh, called<br>\
it بَقْلَةُ عَائِشَةَ; but this is one of their fanciful<br>\
assertions; for such was its name in the time of<br>\
utter paganism: so says Sgh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [أَحْمَقُ<br>\
also signifies More, and most, foolish, or stupid,<br>\
&amp;c. Hence,] it is said in a prov., أَحْمَقُ مِنْ رِجْلَةٍ<br>\
[More foolish, or stupid, than a plant of gardenpurslane: explained by what precedes]. (TA.)<br>\
[See also another prov. voce ثَمَانُونَ.] And in a<br>\
trad., أَحْمَقُ الحُمْقِ الفُجُورُ [The most foolish of<br>\
foolishness, or the most stupid of stupidness, is<br>\
vice, or immorality, or unrighteousness]. (A in<br>\
art. كيس.)<br>\
أَحْمُوقَةٌ is from الحُمْقُ, like أُحْدُوثَةٌ from<br>\
الحَدِيثُ, and أُعْجُوبَةٌ from العَجَبُ: (TA:) it<br>\
signifies An action, or a deed, of those that are<br>\
done by the حَمْقَى [i. e. foolish, or stupid, persons];<br>\
(Mgh;) [a foolish, or stupid, action or deed:]<br>\
it is like ↓ حُمُوقَةٌ, which means an action, a<br>\
practice, or a habit, in which is حُمْق [i. e. foolishness, or stupidity, &amp;c.]. (TA.) One says, وَقَعَ<br>\
فُلَانٌ فِى أُحْمُوقَةٍ [Such a one fell into the commission of a foolish, or stupid, action, &amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
[See حُمَّيْقَةٌ.]<br>\
مُحْمِقٌ and مُحْمِقَةٌ (S, K) A woman who brings<br>\
forth a child that is أَحْمَق [i. e. foolish, &amp;c.];<br>\
(S;) or who brings forth حَمْقَى [i. e. foolish<br>\
children]: (K:) or, accord. to IDrd, the latter<br>\
has this signification; but the former signifies a<br>\
man who begets حَمْقَى; and he does not allow its<br>\
application to a woman. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  المُحْمِقَاتُ<br>\
(tropical:)  The nights [that make a fool of one; i. e.]<br>\
during the whole of which the moon is above the<br>\
horizon but intercepted by clouds; so that one<br>\
imagines that he has arrived at the time of morning;<br>\
(A, O, K, TA;) because he sees light, but sees not<br>\
the moon: derived from الحُمْقُ. (TA.) One<br>\
says, غَرَّنِى غُرُورَ المُحْمِقَاتِ (tropical:)  [He, or it, deceived<br>\
me with the deceiving of the nights thus called].<br>\
(TA.) And you say, سِرْنَا فِى لَيَالِ مُحْمِقَاتٍ (tropical:)  [We<br>\
journeyed during such nights]; because the rider<br>\
therein thinks that he has arrived at the time<br>\
of morning until he becomes weary. (TA.)<br>\
مِحْمَاقٌ A woman who is accustomed to bring<br>\
forth حَمْقَى [i. e. foolish children]. (S, K.)<br>\
مَحْمُوقٌ A man [or child] affected with حُمَاق<br>\
[q. v.]. (A &#39;Obeyd, S.)<br>\
