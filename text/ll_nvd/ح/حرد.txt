حَرَدَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
حَرِدَ, (S, K,) inf. n.<br>\
حَرْدٌ, (S, Msb,) He tended, repaired, betook himself, or directed himself or his course or aim, to<br>\
or towards; made for or towards; aimed at;<br>\
sought, pursued, desired, or intended; (him, or<br>\
it; IAar, K;) syn. قَصَدَ. (IAar, S, A, Msb, K.)<br>\
Agreeably with this explanation, some render the<br>\
words of the Kur [lxviii. 25], وَغَدَوْا عَلَى حَرْدٍ<br>\
قَادِرِينَ. (S.) You say to a man, ↓ قَدْ حَرَدْتُ حَرْدَكَ<br>\
I have tended, repaired, &amp;c., to, or towards, thee;<br>\
like قَصَدْتُ قَصْدَكَ (Fr, S, * L) and أَقْبَلْتُ قِبَلَكَ.<br>\
(Fr, L.) A rájiz says, (S,) namely, Hassán, (so<br>\
in a copy of the S,)<br>\
أَقْبَلَ سَيْلٌ جَآءَ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللّٰهَ<br>\
يَحْرِدُ حَرْدَ الجَنَّةِ المُغِلَّهْ<br>\
[A torrent advanced, that came by the command<br>\
of God, tending to the fruitful garden]. (S.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also, aor.<br>\
حَرِدَ, (K,) inf. n. حَرْدٌ, (S, L,) He prevented, hindered, impeded, withheld, restrained,<br>\
debarred, inhibited, forbade, prohibited, or interdicted; (IAar, S, K;) and so ↓ حرّد, (L, K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَحْرِيدٌ. (TA.) Agreeably with this explanation,<br>\
also, some render the words of the Kur cited<br>\
above: from حَارَدَتْ said of she-camels, meaning<br>\
“ they became scanty in their supplies of milk. ”<br>\
(S.)<br>\
-A3-  Also, aor.<br>\
حَرِدَ, (S, L, K,) or<br>\
حَرُدَ, (AZ, S, L,)<br>\
inf. n. حُرُودٌ; (S, K;) [and app. ↓ تحرّد and<br>\
↓ انحرد; (see حَرِيدٌ;)] He (a man) separated<br>\
himself from others; (K;) he left, or abandoned,<br>\
or forsook, his people, and removed from them;<br>\
(AZ, S;) he retired from his people, and alighted,<br>\
or took up his abode, in a place by himself. (S.)<br>\
-A4-  حَرِدَ, (Sb, S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
حَرَدَ, (Msb, K,) and<br>\
حَرَدَ, aor.<br>\
حَرِدَ, (L, K,) inf. n. حَرْدٌ, (Sb, As, T,<br>\
IDrd, S, Msb, &amp;c.,) so says Aboo-Nasr Ahmad<br>\
Ibn-Hátim, companion of As, (S,) and حَرَدٌ, (T,<br>\
S, Msb,) this latter form of the inf. n. sometimes<br>\
used, accord. to ISk, (S,) and this is the form<br>\
heard by AZ and AO and As from the Arabs of<br>\
chaste speech, (TA,) but both forms are chaste,<br>\
(IAar, TA,) though the former is the more common, (IAar, Msb,) He was, or became, angry:<br>\
(S, Msb, K, &amp;c.:) he was, or became, exasperated<br>\
(تحرّش) by one who angered him, and desired to<br>\
kill him. (T, L.) And حَرَدَ عَلَيْهِ (A, L) and حَرِدَ<br>\
(L) He was angry with him. (A, L.)<br>\
-A5-  حَرِدَ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
حَرَدَ, (S, K,) inf. n. حَرَدٌ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) He (a camel) had the disease termed حَرَدٌ<br>\
[q. v.]: (K:) he had the tendons, or sinews, of<br>\
one of his fore legs relaxed by the cord whereby<br>\
the fore shank is sometimes bound up to the arm,<br>\
or had them in that state naturally, (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, *) so that he shook his fore legs, (S,) or so<br>\
that he beat the ground [with the fore leg], (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) in walking, or going: (S, Mgh, Msb:) or<br>\
he (a camel) had the tendon, or sinew, of his arm<br>\
broken, so that his fore leg became lax, and he<br>\
never ceased to shake it: the tendon, or sinew,<br>\
breaks only in the outer side of the arm, and it<br>\
[the arm] seems, when the camel walks or is in<br>\
motion, as though it stretched, by reason of his<br>\
raising it so high from the ground, and by reason<br>\
of its laxness: (ISh, TA:) or he (a beast) raised<br>\
his legs very high, in walking, or going, and put<br>\
them down in their place, by reason of his being<br>\
very short in his step. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, aor. and<br>\
inf. n. as above, He (a man) was oppressed by<br>\
the weight of his coat of mail, so that he was<br>\
unable to stretch himself out in walking. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And, with the same aor. and inf. n., It (a bowstring) had one or more of the several portions of<br>\
which (by their being twisted together) it was<br>\
composed longer than others. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
حرّد: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  Also, (T, L, K,) inf. n. تَحْرِيدٌ,<br>\
(K,) He twisted a rope so tightly that the strands<br>\
formed knots, and overlay one another: (T, L:)<br>\
and he rolled a rope in twisting it (أَدْرَجَ فَتْلَهُ) so<br>\
that it became round. (AHn, L, K.) [See also<br>\
the pass. part. n., below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And, (K,) inf. n. as<br>\
above, (S, K,) He crooked, curved, or bent, a<br>\
thing, (S, K,) in the form of an arch. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
See also حُرْدِىٌ. [It seems to be implied in the L,<br>\
that one says حرّد حَائِطَ القَصَبِ, meaning He<br>\
bound a حُرْدِىّ (q. v.) upon the fence of reeds, or<br>\
canes, of a fold for sheep &amp;c.]<br>\
-A3-  Also, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. as above, (T, K,) He (a man) betook himself, or repaired, for covert, or lodging, to a<br>\
[house, or hut, such as is called] كُوخ, (T, K,)<br>\
with a gibbous roof. (K.)<br>\
3<br>\
حَارَدَتْ, (S, A, K,) inf. n. حِرَادٌ, (S,) She (a<br>\
camel) was, or became, scanty in her supply of<br>\
milk: (S, A, K:) or ceased to yield milk, or to<br>\
have milk in her udder. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  She<br>\
(a woman) ceased to have milk in her breasts.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  It (a بَاطِيَة or other vessel) ceased<br>\
to have wine, or beverage, in it. (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  It<br>\
(a year, سَنَةٌ,) was one of little rain. (S, A, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And حارد (tropical:)  He (a man) was about to give,<br>\
and then refrained. (A.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And حَارَدَتْ حَالِى<br>\
(tropical:)  My state, or condition, became changed, so as<br>\
not to be known, or so as to be displeasing. (A.)<br>\
4<br>\
احردهُ He separated, or set apart, (K,) and<br>\
removed, (TA,) him, or it. (K, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَحَرَّدَ see 1.<br>\
7<br>\
إِنْحَرَدَ see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also,] It (a star) darted down. (K.)<br>\
حَرْدٌ i. q. قَصْدٌ: whence the phrase, قَدْ حَرَدْتُ<br>\
حَرْدَكَ: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  Anger; [as also ↓ حَرَدٌ: see 1:]<br>\
so in the prov., تَمَسَّكْ بِحَرْدِكَ حَتَّى تُدْرِكَ حَقَّكَ<br>\
Retain, or persist in, thine anger until thou obtain thy right. (TA.) Rancour, or enmity which<br>\
one retains in the heart, watching for an opportunity to indulge it. (El-Kálee, MF.)<br>\
-A3-  See<br>\
also حَرِيدٌ.<br>\
حِرْدٌ The مَبْعَر [i. e. the intestine, or gut, containing the بَعْر, or dung,] of a camel, (As, S, K,)<br>\
male or female; (K;) as also ↓ حِرْدَةٌ: (As, K:)<br>\
pl. حُرُودٌ. (As, S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  An intestine, or a gut:<br>\
(T:) pl. as above: (IAar:) [or] أَحْرَادٌ signifies<br>\
the intestines, or guts, of camels; and is probably<br>\
a pl. of حِرْدٌ, like حُرُودٌ, as the مَبَاعِر and the أَمْعَآء<br>\
are nearly alike. (L.) Accord. to Lth [and the<br>\
K], حِرْدٌ signifies A piece of a camel&#39;s hump: but<br>\
this is a mistake: it means (as explained above)<br>\
an intestine, or a gut. (T.)<br>\
حَرَدٌ: see حَرْدٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also A certain disease in the<br>\
legs of camels, (K, TA,) occasioning them, in<br>\
walking, or going, to shake their legs, and to beat<br>\
the ground with them much: (TA:) or a certain<br>\
disease in their fore legs; (K, TA;) not in the<br>\
hind legs; caused by the cord whereby the fore<br>\
shank is sometimes bound up to the arm: (TA:)<br>\
or an aridity in the tendons, or sinews, of one of<br>\
the fore legs, occasioned by that cord, (K, TA,)<br>\
when the animal is young and recently weaned,<br>\
(TA,) in consequence of which he beats the ground<br>\
with his fore legs, (K, TA,) or [strikes] his breast<br>\
[therewith], in walking, or going: (TA:) the<br>\
disease thus called is casual; [or generally so;<br>\
(see حُرَيْدَآءُ;)] not natural. (T.) [See حَرِدَ.]<br>\
حَرِدٌ: see حَرِيدٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and حَارِدٌ:<br>\
-A3-  and أَحْرَدُ, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
-A4-  Also A rope uneven in its strands.<br>\
(AHn, TA.) A bow-string having one or more<br>\

twisted together) it is composed longer than others.<br>\

sheep, &amp;c. (حَظِيرَة), which is bound upon the fence<br>\
(حَائِط) of reeds, or canes, (Mgh, L, K,) crosswise:<br>\
(Mgh, L:) accord. to IDrd, Nabathæan. (L.)<br>\
You say, ↓ حَرَّدَهُ, inf. n. تَحْرِيدٌ. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
↓ حُرْدِيَّةٌ, (Lth, Msb,) in the &#39;Eyn هُرْدِيَّةٌ, (Mgh,)<br>\

↓ كَأَنَّهُ كَوْكَبٌ فِى الجَوِّ مُنْحَرِدُ<br>\
[As though it were a solitary star in the region<br>\
