حَدَجَهُ, (S, A, K, *) aor.<br>\
حَدِجَ, inf. n. حَدْجٌ (S,<br>\
K) and حِدَاجٌ, (TA,) He bound the حِدْج upon<br>\
him, i. e., upon the camel; (S, A, K;) as also<br>\
↓ احدجهُ: (K:) or he bound upon him the حِدَاجَة,<br>\
i. e., the [saddle called] قَتَب and its apparatus;<br>\
(Az, TA;) which apparatus consists of the بِدَادَانِ<br>\
with the two girths called the بِطَان and the حَقَب,<br>\
without which a camel is not [said to be] مَحْدُوج.<br>\
(Sh, TA.) [See حِدْجٌ.] Accord. to J, حَدَجَ<br>\
also signifies He bound loads, or burdens, and<br>\
divided them into camel-loads: (TA:) but this<br>\
is a meaning that was unknown to the Arabs.<br>\
(Az, TA.) J cites as an ex. the words of ElAashà,<br>\
أَلِلْبَيْنِ تُحْدَجُ أَحْمَالُهَا<br>\
[Is it for separation that her loads are bound<br>\
&amp;c.?]: but he adds that, accord. to one reading,<br>\
the poet said أَجْمَالُهَا: and this [SM says] is the<br>\
right reading. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, حَدَجَ is used<br>\
to signify (tropical:)  He betook himself to warring for the<br>\
sake of the religion.] &#39;Omar is related to have<br>\
said, حِجَّةٌ هٰهُنَا ثُمَّ احْدِجْ هٰهُنَا حَتَّى تَفْنَى, meaning Perform one pilgrimage, then (tropical:)  betake thyself<br>\
to warring for the sake of the religion until thou<br>\
become old and weak, or die; احدج literally signifying bind the حِدَاجَة upon the camel. (Az,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] حَدَجَهُ, (TA,) inf. n. حَدْجٌ,<br>\
(K,) (tropical:)  He imposed upon him in a sale. (K, TA.)<br>\
You say, حَدَجْتُهُ بِبَيْعٍ سَوْءٍ (A, TA) (tropical:)  I imposed<br>\
upon him with a bad sale, and بِمَتَاعٍ سَوْءٍ with bad<br>\
merchandise. (TA.) The person imposed upon<br>\
is likened to a camel upon which a حِدَاجَة is<br>\
bound. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And حَدَجْتُهُ بِمَهْرٍ ثَقيلٍ (tropical:)  I<br>\
imposed upon him a heavy dowry, by deceit and<br>\
fraud. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, aor.<br>\
حَدِجَ, inf. n. حَدْجٌ,<br>\
He cast حَدَج [or unripe and hard colocynths,<br>\
or small colocynths, or small and green colocynths<br>\
or melons,] at him. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (A,<br>\
TA,) حَدَجَهُ بِسَهْمٍ, (S, A,) inf. n. حَدْجٌ, (K,)<br>\
(tropical:)  He shot at him with an arrow. (S, A, K.)<br>\
And حَدَجَهُ بِعَصًا, inf. n. حَدْجٌ, (tropical:)  He beat him,<br>\
or struck him, with a staff, or stick. (Ibn-ElFaraj, K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] حَدَجَهُ بِالتُّهَمَةِ,<br>\
inf. n. حَدْجٌ, (tropical:)  He cast suspicion upon him. (K, *<br>\
TA, * TK.) And حَدَجَهُ بِذَنْبِ غَيْرِهِ (S, A) (tropical:)  He<br>\
accused him of the crime, or offence, of another,<br>\
(S, TA,) and put it upon him. (TA.) And حَدَجَهُ<br>\
بِبَصَرِهِ, (S, A,) aor.<br>\
حَدِجَ, inf. n. حَدْجٌ (S, TA) and<br>\
حُدُوجٌ; and ↓ حدّجهُ, inf. n. تَحْدِيجٌ; (TA;)<br>\
(tropical:)  He cast his eyes at him; (S, TA;) as also<br>\
حَدَجَ إِلَيْهِ بَصَرَهُ: or he looked intently, and sharply,<br>\
at him: or he looked at him with a look which<br>\
he [the latter] suspected and disliked: (TA:)<br>\
but حَدْجٌ in looking may be unattended by alarm,<br>\
or fear: (Az, TA:) ↓ تَحْدِيجٌ is like تَحْدِيقٌ,<br>\
(S,) syn. therewith: (K:) and also signifies the<br>\
looking intently, after alarm, or fear. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
Also حَدَجَ, aor.<br>\
حَدِجَ, inf. n. حُدُوجٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He (a horse)<br>\

حدّجهُ, inf. n. تَحْدِيجٌ: see 1, in two places.<br>\

أَحْدَجَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
-A2-  أَحْدَجَتْ شَجَرَةُ الحَنْظَلِ<br>\
The colocynth-plant bore, or produced, fruit such<br>\
as is termed حَدَجٌ. (S.)<br>\
حِدْجٌ A certain thing upon which the women<br>\
of the Arabs of the desert ride; not a رَحْل nor<br>\
a هَوْدَج: (Lth, TA:) a certain vehicle, or thing<br>\
to ride upon, for women, (Az, S, A, K,) like the<br>\
مِحَفَّة, (Az, S, K,) and like the هَوْدَج; (Az, TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ حِدَاجَةٌ: (S, A, K:) pl. of the former<br>\
حُدُوجٌ and أَحْدَاجٌ (S, A, K) and حُدُجٌ; (AAF,<br>\
TA;) and pl. of the latter حَدَائِجُ: (Yaakoob, S,<br>\
A:) Az, however, says that ISk makes no difference between the حِدْج and the ↓ حِدَاجَة, though<br>\
there is a difference between them accord. to<br>\
the Arabs, as will be seen from what follows:<br>\
Sh says that حِدْجٌ is a name given to a هُوْدَج<br>\
bound upon a قَتَب [or small kind of camel&#39;s<br>\
saddle] when it is bound upon the camel at once<br>\
with all its apparatus: he also says that ↓ حِدَاجَةٌ<br>\
is a name given to the apparatus composed of<br>\
the أَبِدَّة], pl. of بِدَادٌ, q. v.,] which are also called<br>\
مَخَالِى القَتَبِ, [and which are appertenances of<br>\
the قتب,] when they are filled, and drawn together, and bound, and tied to the قتب: [and<br>\
he shows, in his explanation of the verb حَدَجَ,<br>\
that this apparatus comprises the قَتَب and بِدَادَانِ<br>\
with the two girths called the بِطَان and the حَقَب:<br>\
this is what is meant in the K by the saying that<br>\
↓ الحِدَاجَةُ also signifies الأَدَاةُ:] Aboo-Sá&#39;id ElKilábee says that ↓ حداجة signifies the apparatus<br>\
(اداة) of the قتب: and Az says that it signifies<br>\
the قتب with its apparatus. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A<br>\
load, or burden. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [its pl.] حُدُوجٌ,<br>\
Camels with their رِحَال [or saddles]. (TA.)<br>\
حَدَجٌ [a coll. gen. n.] The colocynth, or colocynths, when unripe and hard: (TA:) or when<br>\
