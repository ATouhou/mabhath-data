very sour milk, not to be endured by reason of<br>\
sourness. (S.)<br>\

حَمُضَ, (As,<br>\

(K;) and ↓ احمضت; (A, TS, K;) The camels<br>\

weary of eating حَمْض,] حَمَضْتُ عَنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  I disliked<br>\

حمّض, inf. n. تَحْمِيضٌ: see 1, first signification.<br>\
-A2-  [It seems to be also syn. with تحمّض,<br>\
q. v.: for, ―<br>\
-b2- ] said of a man, it signifies أَتَى<br>\

better of the two places to the worse thereof,<br>\
by reason of preposterous desire: (TA:) as also<br>\
↓ احمض: opposed to أَخَلَّ [q. v.]. (TA in art.<br>\

TS, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And hence,] احمض القَوْمُ (tropical:)  The<br>\
people, or company of men, launched into, or<br>\
entered upon, cheering discourse. (A, TA.) I&#39;Ab<br>\
used to say to his companions, أَحْمِضُوا (tropical:)  [Launch<br>\
ye forth, or enter upon, cheering discourse]; (A,<br>\
TA;) whereupon they would begin to recite<br>\
poetry, and to relate the memorable conflicts of<br>\
the Arabs; (A;) because they then entered into<br>\
traditions and stories of the Arabs, being weary<br>\
of the interpretation of the Kur-án, [like camels<br>\
betaking themselves to the pasture termed حَيْض<br>\
when weary of that termed خُلَّة.] (TA.) [And<br>\
in like manner,] إِحْمَاضٌ also means (assumed tropical:)  The changing<br>\
from seriousness to jesting or joking. (Har<br>\
p. 10.) ―<br>\

-A2-  احمضتُ<br>\

(ISk;) I pastured the camels upon حَمْض. (ISk,<br>\
S K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence, as camels are pastured<br>\
upon حَمْض after they have pastured for a time<br>\
upon خُلَّة,] احمضهُ عَنْهُ, and ↓ حمّضهُ, (tropical:)  He shifted<br>\
him from it [to another thing]. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تحمّض [app. signifies, in its primary acceptation, He (a camel) betook himself to the pasture<br>\
termed حَمْض after eating for a time of that<br>\
termed خُلَّة. (See also 1 and 4 and 2.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
hence,] (tropical:)  He shifted from one thing to another<br>\
thing. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] one says to a<br>\
man when he comes threatening, أَنْتَ مُخْتَلَّ<br>\
فَتَحَمَّضْ (tropical:)  [Thou art disordered in temper, therefore sooth thyself]: (S, A:) from خُلَّةٌ and<br>\
حَمْضٌ. (S.) [See also خُلِّىٌّ, in art. خل.]<br>\
حَمْضٌ [a coll. gen. n.] A kind of plant in<br>\
which is saltness, (A, Msb,) which camels eat<br>\
as though it were fruit, and after which they<br>\
drink: (A:) other plants are termed خُلَّة:<br>\
(Msb:) or what is salt and bitter, of plants;<br>\
(S, K;) such as the رِمْث and the أَثْل and the<br>\
طَرْفَآء and the like: (S:) what is sweet is called<br>\
خُلَّة: (S, K:) or any kind of plant that is salt,<br>\
or sour, rising upon [several] stems, and having<br>\
no [single] أَصْل [or stock]: (M [as cited in the<br>\
L, but I doubt whether the passage be correctly<br>\
transcribed]:) or any salt, or sour, kind of trees;<br>\
having a juicy and quivering leaf, which, when<br>\
squeezed, bursts forth with water; and having a<br>\
pungent, or strong, odour; that cleanses the garment and the hand when they are washed with it;<br>\
such as the نَجِيل and the خذْرَاف and the إِخْرِيط<br>\
and the رِمْث and the قِضَة and the قُلَّام and the<br>\
هَرْم and the حُرْض and the رُغل and the طَرْفَآء<br>\
and the like: (Lh:) or any plant that does not<br>\
dry up in the رَبِيع [or spring], but endures the<br>\
hot season, having in it saltness; when camels eat<br>\
it, they drink upon it; and when they do not<br>\
find it, they become thin and weak: (Lth, T:)<br>\
the Arabs say that the خُلَّة is the bread of camels,<br>\
and the حَمْض is their fruit, (S, A, Msb, K, *)<br>\
or, as some say, their flesh-meat; (S;) or their<br>\
خَبِيص: (TA in art. خل:) and they say that<br>\
flesh-meat is the حَمْض of men: (TA:) the n. un.<br>\
is with ة: (Mgh:) and the pl. is حُمُوضٌ. (S, K.)<br>\
[In Isaiah xxx. 24, the word rendered “ clean ”<br>\
in our authorized version is thought by some to<br>\
mean “ salt ” or “ sour. ”] ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the saying,<br>\
جَاؤُوا مُخِلِّينَ فَلَاقَوْا حَمْضَا<br>\
(tropical:)  They came eagerly desiring evil, or mischief,<br>\
and found him who cured them of that which<br>\
affected them: which is like the saying of<br>\
Ru-beh,<br>\
وَنُورِدُ المُسْتَوْرِدِينَ حَمْضَا<br>\
(tropical:)  And him who cometh to us seeking to do evil,<br>\
or mischief, we cure of his disease: for camels,<br>\
when they are satiated with خُلَّة, eagerly desire<br>\
حَمْض [to cure them of the effect of the former].<br>\
(TA. [See also خُلِّىٌّ, in art. خل.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence,<br>\
also, by way of comparison, حَمْض is applied to<br>\
(tropical:)  Evil, and war: and خُلَّة, to ease, or repose;<br>\
freedom from trouble or inconvenience, and toil<br>\
or fatigue; or tranquillity; and ampleness of circumstances: (T and TA in art. خل:) and the<br>\
former, to death: and the latter, to life. (Ham<br>\
p. 315.) ―<br>\
-b4-  فُؤَادٌ حَمْضٌ and نَفْسٌ حَمْضةٌ mean<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A mind that takes fright at a thing, and shrinks<br>\
from it, at first hearing it. (TA.)<br>\
حَمْضَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  Eager desire for a thing. (S, K.) It<br>\
is said in a trad., الأُذُنُ مَجَّاجَةٌ وَلِلنَّفْسِ حَمْضةٌ;<br>\
(S, TA;) and in another, لِلْأُذُنِ مَجَّةٌ وللنفس<br>\
حمضة; (TA;) [both meaning the same;] (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
ear is wont to reject what it hears, not retaining<br>\
it, when one is exhorted to do a thing, or forbidden to do it, while the mind has eager desire<br>\
to hear: (IAth:) or the ear retains not all that<br>\
that it hears, while having eager desire for what it<br>\
deems elegant, of extraordinary matters of discourse and speech. (Az.) This usage of the word<br>\
is taken from the eager desire of camels for حَمْض<br>\
when they have become weary of خُلَّة. (S.)<br>\

حَامِضٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and أَرْضٌ حَمْضِيَّةٌ: see حَمِيضةٌ.<br>\
حُمُوضةٌ [Acidity; sourness; the quality of<br>\
being sharp or biting to the taste; pungency;]<br>\
the taste of that which is termed حَامِض. (S, K.)<br>\
[See 1.] الحُمُوضةُ is also explained as signifying<br>\
That which bites the tongue; as the taste of<br>\
vinegar, and of milk such as is termed حَازِر:<br>\
which is extr., [if it be meant thereby that the<br>\
word is thus used as an epithet to qualify a subst.,<br>\
or as an epithet in which the quality of a subst.<br>\
is predominant, but I rather think that it is a<br>\
loose way of explaining it as an inf. n. used as a<br>\
simple subst.,] for [the measure] فُعُولَةٌ does not<br>\
belong [save] to inf. ns. (TA: [in which the<br>\
word إِلَّا is evidently omitted by an oversight in<br>\
transcription, and therefore has been supplied by<br>\
me in rendering the passage.])<br>\
أَرْضٌ حَمِيضَةٌ Land abounding with حَمْض;<br>\
(ISh, K;) as also ↓ ارض مُحْمِضَةٌ; (S;) and<br>\
↓ ارض حَمْضِيَّةٌ: (TA:) pl. of the first, أَرَضُونَ<br>\
حُمُضٌ, (as in some copies of the K,) or حُمْضٌ:<br>\
(as in other copies of the same, and in the TA:)<br>\
and حُمُوضٌ [which seems to be another pl. of the<br>\
first of these epithets] is explained as signifying<br>\
land possessing حَمْض. (TA.)<br>\
حُمَّاضٌ [Sorrel; or particularly the rose-flowered<br>\
sorrel; more commonly called in the present day<br>\
حُمَّيْض;] a certain plant having a red flower;<br>\
(S;) a herb, or leguminous plant, of the kind<br>\
termed ذُكُور, having a produce, or fruit, red<br>\
like blood; (Ham p. 823;) a certain herb (K,<br>\
TA) growing in the mountains, of herbs of the<br>\
[season called] رَبِيع, (TA,) the leaves of which<br>\
are like those of the هِنْدِبَآء, (K, TA,) large and<br>\
broad; (TA;) it is acid, (K, TA,) intensely so;<br>\
its flower is red, and its leaves are green: (TA:<br>\
[in which is here added ويتناوس فى ثمره مثل<br>\
حبّ الرمّان, app. for وَيَتَنَوَّسُ الخ; meaning that it<br>\
waves much to and fro when blown by the wind,<br>\
and describing its fruit as containing what resemble the grains of the pomegranate:]) it is<br>\
pleasant to the taste; (K, TA;) and is eaten by<br>\
men, but in small quantity: AHn and Aboo-Ziyád say, it grows very tall, and has a wide leaf,<br>\
and a red flower, which, when it is near to drying<br>\
up, becomes white: and Aboo-Ziyád says, in our<br>\
mountain-country it is abundant; and is of two<br>\
species; one of these two is acid, [but] pleasant to<br>\
the taste; (TA;) and one species thereof is<br>\
bitter; (K, TA;) in the lower parts of each,<br>\
when they are full grown, is a redness; and the<br>\
seeds and leaves of the acid species are used<br>\
medicinally: Az says, it is a wild herb, or leguminous plant, that grows in the days of the [season<br>\
called] رَبِيع, in the channels of water, and has a<br>\
red flower, and is of the herbs, or leguminous plants,<br>\
which are termed ذُكُور: IB says, the places of<br>\
its growth are the small channels of water, and<br>\
the places to which valleys take their courses;<br>\
and in it is acidity: sometimes, also, the people<br>\
of settled habitations make it to grow in their gardens, and water it and sustain it so that it does<br>\
not dry up in the time when the wild herbs, or<br>\
leguminous plants, dry up: it is also said in the<br>\
Minháj that it is both wild and growing in gardens; that the wild is called سلق, [but this name<br>\
is commonly applied to bete,] and in all of this<br>\
there is not acidity: the garden-kind resembles<br>\
the هندباء, and in this is acidity, and an excessive<br>\
viscous moisture: the best is the acid, gardenkind: here ends the quotation from the Minháj:<br>\
(TA:) each species, (K, TA,) the bitter and the<br>\
pleasant, or the garden-kind and the wild, (TA,)<br>\
is good for thirst, and for inflammation arising<br>\
from yellow bile; and strengthens the bowels;<br>\
and allays heaving of the stomach, and hot palpitation, and tooth-ache; and is good for the black<br>\
[or livid] jaundice; (K, * TA;) and, when cooked,<br>\
and applied externally, for the leprosy; and for<br>\
the ringworm (قُوَبَآء); and for glandular swellings<br>\
in the neck, so much so that it is said to do good<br>\
to him who has these even when hung upon the<br>\
neck: with vinegar, also, it is good for the mange,<br>\
or scab; and it is astringent; and puts a stop to<br>\
malacia [so I render شَهْوَةالطِّين, lit. “ the longing<br>\
for clay ”]: its seeds are cold in the first degree,<br>\
and have an astringent property, particularly<br>\
when fried: (TA:) they say that if these be hung,<br>\
in a purse, upon a woman&#39;s left upper arm, she<br>\
will not become pregnant as long as they remain<br>\
upon her: (K, * TA:) they are also good for the<br>\
sting of scorpions; and if some of the seeds be<br>\
swallowed before the scorpion&#39;s stinging, its stinging will not hurt. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also What is in the<br>\
interior of the [kind of citron called] أُتْرُجّ:<br>\
(A, K:) n. un. with ة: (A:) it is cold and dry<br>\
in the third degree; used as a liniment, it removes<br>\
freckles and the like, and clears the complexion;<br>\
and it suppresses (يَقْمَعُ) the yellow bile; and<br>\
gives appetite for food; and is good for hot<br>\
palpitation; and made into a beverage, it sweetens<br>\
the odour of the mouth; and is good for looseness<br>\
arising from yellow bile; and is suitable for<br>\
those who are fevered. (TA.) [In the present<br>\
day, in Egypt, this name is applied to A species<br>\
of citron, itself, with a conical apex, and very<br>\
acid pulp.]<br>\
حُمَّيْضَى A certain plant: not from حُمُوضَة.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
حُمَّاضِيَّةٌ A confection composed of حُمَّاض of<br>\
the أُتْرُجّ. (TA.)<br>\
حَامِضٌ [Acid; sour; sharp or biting to the taste;<br>\
pungent; having a taste like that of vinegar or like<br>\
that of sour milk; see حُمُوضةٌ;] (S, Msb, K;) applied<br>\
to milk (TA) and other things; (Msb;) and ↓ مُحَمِّضٌ<br>\
signifies the same, applied to a grape. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] رَجُلٌ حَامِضُ الفُؤَادِ (tropical:)  A man whose heart,<br>\
or mind, is altered and bad, (O, K,) فِى الغَضَبِ<br>\
in anger. (O.) And فُلَانٌ حَامِضُ الرِّئَتَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  Such<br>\
a one is in a loathing state of mind; syn. مُرُّ<br>\
النَّفْسِ. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  إِبِلٌ حَامِضَةٌ Camels pasturing<br>\
