حَجَمَ said of the breast of a woman or girl:<br>\
see 4.<br>\
-A2-  حَجَمَ, (ISk, S, K,) aor.<br>\
حَجُمَ and<br>\
حَجِمَ, inf. n.<br>\
حَجْمٌ, (K,) He (a child, ISk, S, TA) sucked<br>\
(ISk, S, K) the breast of his mother. (ISk, S,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] حَجَمَهُ, aor.<br>\
حَجُمَ, inf. n. حَجْمٌ,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb,) He scarified him [and drew<br>\
blood from him with the مِحْجَمَة; i. e. he cupped<br>\
him]; (Msb;) he performed upon him the operation of the حَجَّام, (Mgh,) or, of the حَاجِم, (S,)<br>\
who sucks the mouth of the مِحْجَمَة [to draw the<br>\
blood]. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence,] حَجَمَتْهُ الحَيَّةُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The serpent bit him. (TA.) And حَجَمَتِ<br>\
الفُحُولُ العَيْرَ (tropical:)  The stallions bit the ass. (TA.)<br>\
And حَجَمَ العَظْمَ, (TA,) inf. n. as above, (K,)<br>\

حَجُمَ, (S TA,) inf. n.<br>\
as above, (TA,) He put a حِجَام upon the mouth<br>\
[or muzzle] of the camel, when excited, in order<br>\
that he might not bite; (S, TA;) [he muzzled<br>\
the camel;] he bound the camel&#39;s mouth [or<br>\
muzzle] with a thing. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (Har<br>\
p. 474,) حَجَمْتُهُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ, (S, Msb, * TA,) and<br>\
عَنْ صَاحِبَتِهِ, (TA,) inf. n. as above, (K,) I made<br>\
him to refrain, forbear, abstain, (S, TA,) or go<br>\
back; (Msb;) or I withheld him, or restrained<br>\
him; (S, K, TA;) from the thing, (S, TA,) and<br>\
from his female companion. (TA.) And حَجَمَ<br>\
طَرْفَهُ عَنْهُ He turned away his eye, or eyes, from<br>\
him, or it. (TA.) And عَنْ حَاجَتِهِ ↓ أَحْجَمْتُهُ is<br>\
also mentioned, as meaning I withheld him from<br>\
the object of his want; or prevented him from<br>\
attaining it. (TA.)<br>\

حجّم: see 4. ―<br>\

(K:) or was, or became, round, and swelling,<br>\
prominent, or protuberant; as also ↓ حجّم: (A,<br>\
TA:) properly, became such as to have what is<br>\
termed حَجْمٌ, (Mgh, TA,) meaning projection,<br>\
protrusion, prominence, or protuberance, and<br>\
elevation: (Mgh:) or, as some say, became such<br>\
that the suckling might suck it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَحْجَمَتْ<br>\
لِلْمَوْلُودِ (tropical:)  She (a woman) suckled the new-born<br>\
child for the first time. (K, TA.)<br>\

from it; (S, K;) quasi-pass. of حجَمْتُهُ, like<br>\
as أَكَبَّ is of كَبَبْتُهُ; which are extr. of their<br>\
kind; (S;) and اجحم عنه signifies the same;<br>\
(S in art. جحم;) but is a rare dial. var.: (Har<br>\
p. 95:) or he drew back from it, or him, in awe,<br>\
or fear: (K, TA:) or he receded, or drew back,<br>\
form it; namely, a thing, or an affair: (Msb:)<br>\
and أَحْجَمْتُ عَنِ القَوْمِ I dreaded, or feared, the<br>\
people, or party, and returned, and left them,<br>\
after I had desired to go to them. (AZ, Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  احجم also signifies He (a man) advanced,<br>\
or went forward; and so اجحم: both of these<br>\
verbs thus having two contr. meanings. (MF.)<br>\

احتجم He performed the operation of<br>\
cupping: (MA, KL, PS:) [or rather he had<br>\

blood drawn from him by that operation; a<br>\
quasi-pass. verb, like افتصد and اكتوى and<br>\
احترق and countless others:] or he sought, or<br>\
demanded, the performance of that operation<br>\
[upon himself]. (K TA.) One says, اِحْتَجَمْتُ<br>\

thing that one feels beneath his hand: (ElGhooree, Mgh:) or the part of a thing that one<br>\

One says, لَيْسَ لِمِرْفَقِهِ حَجْمٌ There is no projection,<br>\
protrusion, prominence, or protuberance, to his<br>\
elbow. (S.) Lh says that حَجْمُ العَظْمِ means One&#39;s<br>\
perceiving the feel of the bones [or bone] behind<br>\
the skin: thus explaining it after the manner of<br>\
explaining inf. ns.: and ISd says, I known not<br>\
whether it be in his opinion an inf. n. or a simple<br>\
subst. (TA.) And Lth says that الحَجْمُ means<br>\
One&#39;s perceiving the feel of a thing beneath a<br>\
garment: [and that] one says, مَسَسْتُ بَطْنَ<br>\
الحُبْلَى فَوَجَدْتُ حَجْمَ الصَّبِىِّ فِى بَطْنِهَا [which<br>\
plainly means, I felt the belly of the pregnant<br>\
woman, and perceived the bulging of the child in<br>\
her belly]. (Mgh, TA.) It is said [of a woman&#39;s<br>\
garment] in a trad., لَا يَصِفُ حَجْمَ عِظَامِهَا [lit.<br>\
(tropical:) It does not describe the projecting of her bones]:<br>\
meaning, the garment does not stick to her body<br>\
so as to tell what projects of her bones: it is<br>\
made to be a describer by way of comparison.<br>\
(IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [In post-classical works it is<br>\
often used as signifying Bulk, bigness, or magnitude.]<br>\
حَجَامٌ [A muzzle for a camel, commonly a net<br>\
of cord;] a thing that is put upon the mouth,<br>\
or muzzle, of a camel, (S, K,) when he is excited,<br>\
(S,) to prevent his biting. (S, K.)<br>\
حَجُومٌ Gentle, nice, or skilful, in operation;<br>\
syn. رَفِيقٌ [in the CK, erroneously, رَقِيقٌ] as an<br>\

-b2-  (tropical:)  The فَرْج [meaning vulva,<br>\
or vagina,] of a woman. (K, TA.)<br>\
حِجَامَةٌ The craft, or art, of the حَاجِم or حَجَّام<br>\
[i. e. cupper]: (S, * Mgh, Msb, K:) and the operation that he performs. (S, * TA.)<br>\
حَجَّامٌ A cupper; syn. مَصَّاصٌ [lit. one who is<br>\
in the habit of sucking]; (K;) one who performs<br>\
the operation termed حَجْمٌ; (S, Mgh;) one who<br>\
scarifies [and draws blood with the مِحْجَمَة];<br>\
(Msb;) as also ↓ حَاجِمٌ; (S, Msb, K;) but the<br>\
former is an intensive epithet [denoting frequency<br>\
or habit]: (Msb:) so called because he sucks the<br>\
mouth of the مِحْجَمَة. (Az, TA.) Hence the<br>\
prov. أَفْرَغُ مِنْ حَجَّامِ سَابَاطَ [More unoccupied<br>\
than the cupper of Sábát (the name of a place)]:<br>\
for military forces used to pass by the man to<br>\
whom it relates, and he used to cup them on<br>\
credit, in consequence of want of employment,<br>\
waiting for payment until they should return.<br>\
