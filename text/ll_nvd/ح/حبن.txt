أمُّ حُبَيْنٍ A certain small beast or reptile, (S,<br>\
K,) well known; (K;) the عِظَايَة: (Mgh:) or<br>\
a species of the [kind of lizards termed] عِظَآء;<br>\
of stinking odour: (Msb:) so called because of<br>\
the largeness of its belly; from أَحْبَنُ [q. v.]:<br>\
also called ↓ حُبَيْنَةُ; (S, Msb, K;) and sometimes<br>\
the article ال is prefixed to it, (S, Msb, K,) so<br>\
that it is called أُمُّ الحُبَيْنِ, (S, Msb,) by poetic<br>\
license: (TA:) it is of the form of the حِرْبَآء [or<br>\
chameleon], broad in the breast, and large in the<br>\
belly: (TA:) or, accord. to some, (TA,) it is<br>\
the female of the حِرْبَآء: (S and Msb and K in<br>\
art. حرب, and TA in the present art.:) accord.<br>\
to Az, it is a small reptile resembling the [kind of<br>\
lizard called] ضَبّ: (Msb:) or, as some say, a<br>\
certain reptile of the size of a man&#39;s hand: or,<br>\
accord. to Ibn-Ziyád, a dust-coloured reptile,<br>\
with four legs, and of the size of a frog that is<br>\
not large; and when the children hunt it, they<br>\
say to it,<br>\
انَّ الأَمِيرَ نَاظِرٌ إِلَيْكِ  أُمَّ الحُبَيْنِ اُنْشُرِى بُرْدَيْكِ<br>\
[Umm-el-Hobeyn, spread forth thy two wings:<br>\
verily the commander is looking at thee]: they<br>\
hunt it until fatigue overcomes it, when it stops,<br>\
standing upright upon its two kind legs, and<br>\
spreads forth two wings that it has, of the same<br>\
dust-colour; and when they hunt it further, it<br>\
spreads forth wings that were beneath those two<br>\
wings, than which nothing more beautiful in<br>\
colour has been seen, yellow and red and green<br>\
and white, in streaks, one above another, very<br>\
many; and when it has done this, they leave it:<br>\
no offspring of it is found; nor any genital<br>\
organ: (TA:) the appellation أُمُّ حُبَيْنٍ is determinate, like اِبْنُ عِرْسٍ and اِبْنُ آوَى; (S, Msb;)<br>\
and [so is ↓ حُبَيْنَةُ,] like أُسَامَةُ; (S;) but determinate as a generic appellation: (S, Msb:) the<br>\
suppression of the article does not render it indeterminate; which is contr. to rule: (S, K:)<br>\
the pl. is أُمُّ حُبَيْنَاتٍ, [which is strange,] and<br>\
أُمَّاتُ حُبَيْنٍ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The Arabs say, in one of<br>\
their imprecations, صَبَّ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ أُمَّ حُبَيْنٍ مَاخِضًا<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [May God pour upon thee] the night.<br>\
(Ibn-Buzurj, TA in art. مخص.)<br>\
حُبَيْنَةُ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
أَحْبَنُ Having the dropsy; (S, Mgh, Msb;) as<br>\
also ↓ مَحْبُونٌ (KL) [and ↓ حَبِينٌ; so in the Lex.<br>\
of Golius; and so in the present day]: having a<br>\
disease in the belly, whereby it becomes large and<br>\
swollen: (K:) fem. حَبْنَآءُ, (S, K,) applied to a<br>\
woman: (S:) pl. حُبْنٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (TA,)<br>\
the fem., (tropical:)  Big-bellied; (K, TA;) applied to a<br>\
woman. (TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  A foot (قَدَمٌ) having<br>\
much flesh in the بَخَصَةٌ [app. here meaning the<br>\
pulpy portion of the sole]; (K;) as though it<br>\
were swollen. (TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  A pigeon (حَمَامٌ)<br>\
that does not lay eggs: pl. حُبْنٌ. (K.)<br>\
مَحْبُونٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مُحْبَئِنٌّ (assumed tropical:)  Angry. (K.)<br>\
