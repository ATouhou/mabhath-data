(Mgh, K,) applicable to any time, (Az, K,) little<br>\
or much, (Mgh, Msb,) long or short, that may<br>\
be a year and more: or [in some cases] particularly meaning forty years: or seven years:<br>\
or two years: or six months: or two months:<br>\
or any morning and evening: (K:) also a space<br>\
of time; (S, K;) as in the Kur lxxvi. I, (S,)<br>\
and in the Kur xxxvii. 178: (K:) and a continuous time: (Ham p. 381:) and the day of<br>\
resurrection; (K;) or the coming to pass of the<br>\
resurrection; as in the Kur xxxviii. last verse:<br>\
(Mgh, TA:) or it has two meanings; namely,<br>\
a time of unknown limit, and also, as in the Kur<br>\
xiv. 30, six months: (Fr, Msb:) accord. to Er-Rághib, the time of a thing&#39;s arriving, or coming,<br>\
and happening; having a vague meaning, and<br>\
rendered particular, or special, by that to which<br>\
it is prefixed: some say that it occurs applied in<br>\
different ways: to an appointed term; as that<br>\
to which God makes one to live: and a year;<br>\
as in the Kur xiv. 30: and to the time when<br>\
an event takes place; as in the Kur xxx. 16:<br>\
and to time absolutely: accord. to El-Munáwee,<br>\
in the [genuine] language of the Arabs, it is<br>\
applied to [the time of] a glance of the eye, and<br>\
more than that, to time without end: (TA:)<br>\
the pl. is أَحْيَانٌ, (S, Msb, K,) and pl. pl. أَحَايِينُ;<br>\
(S, * K;) as in the saying, فُلَانٌ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا أَحْيَانًا<br>\
and فِى الأَحَايِينِ [Such a one does so at times,<br>\
or sometimes]. (S.) In the Kur [xiv. 30], تُؤْتِى,<br>\
أُكُلَهَا كُلَّ حِينٍ means [Which yieldeth its<br>\
fruit] every six months: (Fr, Msb, TA:) or<br>\
every year: or every morning and evening: or,<br>\
accord. to Az, in every season, uninterruptedly.<br>\
(TA.) شَىْءٍ ↓ مِحْيَانُ, also, means حِينُهُ [The<br>\
time, or season, of a thing]. (K.) [You say,<br>\
إِلَى حِينٍ For a time, or season.] And حِينًا At<br>\
one time; sometime; at some time; awhile.<br>\
(Mgh.) حِينَ in the phrase قُمْتُ حِينَ قُمْتَ [I<br>\
stood in the time when thou stoodest, or I stood<br>\
when thou stoodest,] is an adv. n. of time; (Msb;)<br>\
[see also an ex. in a verse cited voce خَشَفَ, and<br>\
the remarks there subjoined:] and one may well<br>\
employ in its place لَمَّا and إِذَا (Msb, TA) and<br>\
إِذْ and مَتَى and سَاعَةَ (TA) and وَقْتَ (Msb, TA)<br>\
and the like; but not, as many have said, حَيْثُ;<br>\
for this is an adv. n. of place. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  When<br>\
they make the two times to be distant, the<br>\
one from the other, [i. e. the time of speaking and the time spoken of,] they do so by<br>\
means of إذ, and thus, (K,) they say حِينَئِذٍ<br>\
[meaning At that time; then]: (S, K:) and<br>\
sometimes they suppress the ء, substituting for<br>\
it ى. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Sometimes, also, they prefix تَ<br>\
to حِينَ; (S, TA;) and say لَا تَحِينَ, meaning<br>\
It is not, or was not, a time [of such a thing;<br>\
but this is generally written لَاتَ حِينَ]; as in<br>\
the Kur xxxviii. 2 [respecting which see art.<br>\
ليت]. (TA.) Aboo-Wejzeh Es-Saadee says,<br>\
اَلْعَاطِفُونَ تَحِينَ مَا مِنْ عَاطِفٍ<br>\
وَالمُطْعِمُونَ زَمَانَ أَيْنَ المُطْعِوُ<br>\
[The persons who return to the attack when there<br>\
is none other that returns to the attack, (as is<br>\
said in the S and L in art. عطف,) or it may mean<br>\
who act affectionately in the time when there is<br>\
none other that acts affectionately; as is said in<br>\
the L in that art.;) and the feeders in the time<br>\
when it is said, Where is the feeder?]: (S:) ISd<br>\
says that ت is thus prefixed to حين like as it<br>\
is in تَلَانَ meaning الآنَ: but IB says that Ibn-Es-Seeráfee cites the former hemistich thus:<br>\
اَلْعَاطِفُونَهْ حِينَ مَامِنْ عَاطِفٍ<br>\
[with the ه of pausation]: and some say that the<br>\
ه of pausation is likened to the fem. ة, and is then<br>\
made movent with fet-h. (TA. [See more in art.<br>\
ليت.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also حِينَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
حَانَةٌ: see art. حون.<br>\
حَيْنَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
حِينَةٌ [The time appointed for a she-camel to<br>\
be milked in every day and night;] a subst.<br>\
from حَيَّنَ النَّاقَةَ; as also ↓ حِينٌ: you say, مَتَى<br>\
حِينَةُ نَاقَتِكَ, meaning When is the time of the<br>\
milking of thy she-camel? and كَمْ حِينَتُهَا, meaning How many times is she milked? (K.) One<br>\
says also, of a man, (S,) يَأْكُلُ الحِينَةَ and ↓ الحَيْنَةَ,<br>\
meaning He eats once in the day and the night:<br>\
(S, K:) or, accord. to Aboo-&#39;Amr Ez-Záhid,<br>\
الوَجْبَة is used as meaning a man&#39;s eating once in<br>\
the day, and الحينة as meaning a she-camel&#39;s<br>\
being milked once in the day. (IB, TA.) And<br>\
one says, مَا أَلْقَاهُ إِلَّا الحِينَةَ بَعْدَ الحِينَةَ, i. e. الحِينَ<br>\
↓ بَعْدَ الحِينِ [I do not meet him save time after<br>\
time; meaning, occasionally]. (K.)<br>\

is, in one place, erroneously substituted for حَانِيَّةٌ,<br>\
as meaning “ wine. ”]<br>\
مَحُونَةٌ [mentioned in the K in art. محن] is<br>\
from الحَيْنُ or المِحْنَةُ. (TA.)<br>\
