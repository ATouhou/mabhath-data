and a fleet, or swift, camel: (K:) a quick-paced<br>\
and light-paced camel; as also ↓ حَتْحَتٌ: (TA:)<br>\
and a male ostrich. (K.) The Hudhalee says,<br>\
(S,) namely, El-Aalam, (TA,)<br>\
على حَتِّ البُرَايَةِ زَمْخَرِىِّ السْ<br>\
سَوَاعِدِ ظَلَّ فِى شَرْىٍ طِوَالِ<br>\
(S, TA:) he likens himself, says As, in his running and fleeing, to a male ostrich, as is shown<br>\
by what precedes this verse: (S:) by حتّ البراية<br>\
is said to be meant حَتٍّ عِنْدَ البُرَايَةِ, i. e. (tropical:)  fleet, or<br>\
swift, when emaciated by journeying; the subst.<br>\
براية being said to be put for the inf. n. بَرْى:<br>\
(A, * L:) some of the Basrees say that the poet<br>\
means a camel; but As disapproves of this, because to that which he here describes he has<br>\
before applied the epithet هِجَفّ: ISd says that<br>\
in his opinion he likens his horse or his camel to<br>\
a male ostrich, because of the epithet هجفّ, preceding, and because neither the horse nor the<br>\
camel eats the colocynth, but this plant is cropped<br>\
by ostriches; شرى meaning the colocynth: IJ<br>\
says that شرى here signifies a tree of which bows<br>\
are made; and the poet means that if the trees<br>\
thus called are tall, they conceal him, and he is<br>\
the more lonesome, or sad; and that if they were<br>\
short, his eye would range freely, and he would<br>\
be pleased, and would run gently. (L.)<br>\

also حَتَّى, near the end of the paragraph.<br>\
حُتٌّ, applied to سوِيق, i. q. مَلْتُوتٌ [i. e. Moistened, or stirred about, with water, &amp;c.]. (K.)<br>\
[See also حُثٌّ.]<br>\
حَتَتٌ A disease that affects trees, in consequence<br>\
of which their leaves fall off. (TA.)<br>\
حتّه [app. حِتَّةٌ, as pronounced in the present<br>\
day; pl. حِتَتٌ; now applied to A bit of anything; properly, a paring, or scraping;] a piece<br>\
of peel or bark or crust or the like. (TA.)<br>\
حَتَاتٌ Cries, shouts, noises, or clamour; or a<br>\
confusion, or mixture, of cries or shouts or noises,<br>\
or of crying or shouting or noise. (K.)<br>\
حُتَاتٌ What is rubbed and scraped off; or<br>\
what becomes scattered, strewn, or dispersed; or<br>\
what becomes so by degrees, part after part; of<br>\
a thing. (S, TA.) A word of this class generally<br>\
ends with ة; (TA;) [as قُلَامَةٌ and نُجَارَةٌ &amp;c.;<br>\
but ↓ حُتَاتَهٌ seems to be also used in the same<br>\
sense: and hence the phrase,] مَافِى يَدِى مِنْهُ<br>\
حُتَاتَهٌ, so in the A, but in the K ↓ حَتٌّ, (TA,)<br>\
There is not aught of it in my hand. (A, K,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A disease that attacks the camel,<br>\
so that he becomes emaciated, and his flesh and<br>\
fat and colour change, and his hair falls off.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
حَتُوتٌ A palm-tree of which the full-grown<br>\
unripe dates fall off and become scattered, one<br>\
after another; as also ↓ مِحْتَاتٌ: (K:) and the<br>\
latter, a tree that scatters its leaves. (TA.)<br>\
حُتَاتَةٌ: see حُتَاتٌ.<br>\
حَتَّى is a particle, used in three senses: (Mughnee:) it is a particle denoting the end of an extent; (Mughnee, K;) which is its predominant<br>\
meaning; (Mughnee;) asserted by some to be<br>\
always its meaning: (TA:) and denoting a cause,<br>\
or motive: and syn. with إِلَّا as an exceptive;<br>\
(Mughnee, K;) which last is the rarest, and is<br>\
mentioned by few. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is used as<br>\
a preposition governing the gen. case, in the same<br>\
manner as إِلَى (S, Mughnee) in respect of meaning and government, (Mughnee,) denoting the<br>\
end of an extent; (S;) [signifying To, till, until,<br>\
or to the time of;] but the word that it so governs<br>\
must be a noun properly so called, not a pronoun<br>\
except in a case of poetic license; and must<br>\
signify the last part, or portion, of what is signified by that which precedes حتّى, as in the saying,<br>\
أَكَلْتُ السَّمَكَةَ حَتَّى رَأْسِهَا [I ate the fish, even to its<br>\
head]; or must be prefixed to the word signifying<br>\
that part, or portion, as in the saying, [in the<br>\
Kur xcvii. last verse,] سَلَامٌ هِىَ حَتَّى مَطْلَعِ الفَجْرِ<br>\
[A night of peace, or of salutation, is it, until the<br>\
time of the rising of the dawn]. (Mughnee.) It<br>\
is also followed by a mansoob aor., as in سِرْتُ<br>\
حَتَّى أَدْخُلَهَا [I journeyed until I entered it, ادخلها<br>\
here virtually meaning دَخَلْتُهَا], أَنْ being here<br>\
understood after حتّى, and the ان together with<br>\
the verb being rendered in grammatical analysis<br>\
by an inf. n. governed in the gen. case by حتّى<br>\
[so that حتّى ان ادخلها means حتّى دُخُولِى إِيَّاهَا]:<br>\
this is one of the cases in which حتّى differs from<br>\
إِلَى; for one may not say, سِرْتُ إِلَى أَدْخُلَهَا [with<br>\
أَنْ understood after الى]: and in the same sense<br>\
it is used in the phrase, [in the Kur xx. 93,] حَتَّى<br>\
يَرْجِعَ إِلَيْنَا مُوسَى [Until Moses return to us].<br>\
(Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is also syn. with كَىْ, denoting<br>\
a cause or motive [of action &amp;c., signifying To<br>\
the end that, in order that, or so that], as in the<br>\
saying, أَسْلِمْ حَتَّى تَدْخُلَ الجَنَّةَ [Become a Muslim, to the end that, or in order that, or so that,<br>\
thou mayest enter Paradise]; being in this case,<br>\
likewise, followed by a mansoob aor. (Mughnee.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  It is also used [as a preposition virtually governing the gen. case, أَنْ being understood after<br>\
it,] in the sense of إِلَّا, meaning Except, or unless,<br>\
likewise followed by a mansoob aor., as in the<br>\
following verse:<br>\
لَيْسَ العَطَآءُ مِنَ الفُضُولِ سَمَاحَةً<br>\
حَتَّى تَجُودَ وَمَا لَدَيْكَ قَلِيلُ<br>\
[The giving of superfluities is not liberality:<br>\
(giving is not liberality) except, or unless, (or<br>\
here we may also say until,) thou be bountiful<br>\
when little is in thy possession]. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
It is also a conjunction, like وَ, [signifying And,<br>\
or rather even,] (S, Mughnee,) but on three conditions: first, that the word following it and<br>\
conjoined by it be a noun properly so called, not<br>\
a pronoun: secondly, that this noun signify a<br>\
part, or portion, of what is signified by that<br>\
which precedes حتّى, as in قَدِمَ الحُجَّاجُ حَتَّى<br>\
المُشَاةُ [The pilgrims arrived: even those on foot],<br>\
and أَكَلْتُ السَّمَكَةَ حَتّى رَأْسَهَا [I ate the fish: even<br>\
its head]: thirdly, that the noun following it and<br>\
conjoined by it denote either the greatest or the<br>\
least [literally or figuratively] of what are included in the signification of the noun that precedes حتّى, as in مَاتَ النَّاسُ حَتَّى الأَنْبِيَآءُ [Men<br>\
have died: even the prophets], and زَارَكَ النَّاسُ حَتَّى<br>\
الحَجَّامُونَ [The people visited thee: even the<br>\
cuppers]. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b6-  It is also used as an<br>\
inceptive particle, (S, Mughnee,) preceding a<br>\
nominal proposition, (Mughnee,) as in the following verse (of Jereer [so in a copy of the S]):<br>\
فَمَا زَالَتِ القَتْلَى تَمُجَّ دِمَآءَهَا<br>\
بِدِجْلَةَ حَتَّى مَآءُ دِجْلَةَ أَشْكَلُ<br>\
[And the slain ceased not to emit their blood into<br>\
the Tigris, so that the water of the Tigris was of<br>\
a mixed colour consisting of red and white]: (S,<br>\
Mughnee:) and preceding a verbal proposition,<br>\
of which the verb is a pret., as in the phrase,<br>\
[in the Kur vii. 93,] حَتَّى عَفَوْا وَقَالُوا [So that<br>\
they became numerous, and said]: (Mughnee:)<br>\
and preceding a marfooa aor., as in the phrase,<br>\
[in the Kur ii. 210,] حَتَّى يَقُولُ الرَّسُولُ [So that<br>\
the Apostle said, or, as in the S, so that this was<br>\
the case: the Apostle said], accord. to him who<br>\
reads يَقُولُ; (IHsh, in De Sacy&#39;s “ Anthol.<br>\
Gramm. Ar.,” p. 82 of the Arabic text;) others<br>\
reading يَقُولَ, which, as well as يَقُولُ, here means<br>\
قَالَ. (Jel.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [Respecting the cases in which<br>\
the mansoob aor. is used after حاّى, and those<br>\
in which the marfooa aor. is used, the following<br>\
observations are made.] When حتّى precedes a<br>\
future, the latter is mansoob, by reason of أَنْ understood before it, as in the saying, سِرْتُ إِلى<br>\
الكُوفَةِ حَتَّى أَدْخُلَهَا [I journeyed to El-Koofeh<br>\
until I entered it: see above]: (S:) it is not<br>\
mansoob unless the verb is a future: if it is<br>\
future with respect to the time of speaking, it<br>\
must be mansoob, as in حَتَّى يَرْجِعَ إِلَيْنَا مُوسَى<br>\
[cited above]: if the verb is future with respect<br>\
to what precedes, only, it may be mansoob, as in<br>\
حَتَّى يَقُولَ الرَّسُولُ [mentioned above]; or it may be<br>\
marfooa; but not unless [somehow] denoting a present time; (Mughnee;) and if present with respect<br>\
to the time of speaking, it must be marfooa, as in<br>\
the saying, سِرْتُ إِلَى الكُوفَةِ حَتَّى أَدْخُلُهَا [I have<br>\
journeyed to El-Koofeh so that now I am entering it]; (S, Mughnee; *) but if not really present,<br>\
it is not marfooa unless denoting a past event as<br>\
though it were present, as in حَتَّى يَقُولُ الرَّسُولُ<br>\
[explained above]; nor may it be marfooa<br>\
unless denoting an effect of what precedes it;<br>\
so that you may not say, سِرْتُ حَتَّى تَطْلُعُ الشَّمْسُ,<br>\
nor مَا سِرْتُ حَتَّى أَدْخُلُهَا unless the ما is regarded<br>\
as prefixed to the entire affirmative phrase that<br>\
follows it, nor هَلْ سِرْتَ حَتَّى تَدْخُلُهَا; nor may<br>\
it be marfooa unless it denote a complement to<br>\
what precedes it, so that you may not say سيْرى<br>\
حَتَّى أَدْخُلُهَا, as the inchoative would in this case<br>\
be without an enunciative. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b8-  [The<br>\
following verse of El-Farezdak is cited in the<br>\
Mughnee as an ex. of حتّى used as an inceptive<br>\
particle:<br>\
فَوَاعَجَبَا حَتَّى كُلَيْبٌ تَسُبُّنِى<br>\
كَأَنَّ أَبَاهَا نَهْشَلٌ وَمُجَاشِعُ<br>\
and it is there added that يَسُبُّنِى النَّاسُ must be<br>\
understood in this verse before حتّى: but I rather<br>\
think that حتّى is here a conjunctive particle, and<br>\
that the meaning is, And alas, my wonder! the<br>\
people revile me: even Kuleyb revile me, as<br>\
though their father were Nahshal and as though<br>\
he were Mujáshi&#39;.] ―<br>\
-b9-  It should be observed that<br>\
حتُّى may be used in three different ways in some<br>\
sentences: thus you may say, using it as a preposition (in the sense of إِلَى), أَكَلْتُ السَّمَكَةَ حَتَّى<br>\
رَأْسِهَا [I ate the fish, even to its head]; and, using<br>\
it as a conjunction, حَتَّى رَأْسَهَا [even its head];<br>\
and, using it as an inceptive particle, حَتَّى رَأْسُهَا<br>\
[for حَتَّى رَأْسُهَا مَأْكُولٌ so that its head was eaten].<br>\
(Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b10-  It is said in the K that حتّى<br>\
renders makhfood and marfooa and mansoob;<br>\
and that therefore Fr said, أَمُوتُ وَفِى نَفْسِى مِنْ<br>\
حَتَّى شَىْءٌ [“ I shall die with something respecting<br>\
حتّى (remaining unsettled) in my mind ”]: this is<br>\
said on the supposition that حتّى deviates in<br>\
government from an established rule, which is,<br>\
that a particle which governs one part of speech<br>\
governs that only; those, for instance, which<br>\
render mansoob and mejzoom governing verbs<br>\
only, and the particles that govern nouns governing none but nouns: but the truth is, that حتّى<br>\
governs only the gen. case; a marfooa noun or<br>\
aor. after it would be so without it, as حتّى in<br>\
this case is only an inceptive particle; and a<br>\
mansoob aor. after it is rendered so by أَنْ understood, so that حتّى in this case virtually governs<br>\
a noun in the gen. case [as has been shown<br>\
above]: therefore the remark quoted above from<br>\
the K is faulty, and confounds things that should<br>\
be distinguished. (MF, TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  Some say that<br>\
حتّى is [a noun] of the measure فَعْلَى, from<br>\
↓ الحَتُّ the ceasing from a thing, having finished<br>\
it; or the becoming unoccupied by a thing; like<br>\
شَتَّى from الشَّتُّ: but Az disapproves of this,<br>\
because, were it so, the pronunciation termed<br>\
إِمَالَة would be allowable in its case, and it is not<br>\
so: حتّى, he says, is a particle, not a noun, nor<br>\
a verb. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b12-  حَتَّامَ is originally حَتَّى مَا [Till<br>\
when? until when? or how long?]: the ا of ما<br>\
is elided because the expression is used interrogatively, like as it is when any preposition is prefixed to it if used interrogatively, as in بِمَ and<br>\
فِيمَ and عَمَّ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b13-  In the dial. of Hudheyl,<br>\
عَتَّى is said for حَتَّى. (L.)<br>\
مَا تَرَكُوا إِلَّا رِمْدَةَ حَتَّانَ, or حَتَّانٍ, (as in different copies of the K in art. رمد,) They left not<br>\
of them so much as thou mightest rub thy hands<br>\
therewith and then blow it away in the wind<br>\
after rubbing it off. (K ubi suprà.)<br>\
حَتْحَتٌ: see حَتٌّ.<br>\
حَتْحَتَةٌ (tropical:)  Quickness, (K, TA,) and haste, in<br>\
anything. (TA.) [App. an inf. n., of which the<br>\
verb is ↓ حَتْحَتَ.] Hence the prov., شَرُّ السَّيْرِ<br>\
الحَتْحَتَهُ (tropical:)  [The worst pace is that which is quick<br>\
and hasty: but in Freytag&#39;s “ Ar. Prov. ” (i. 654,)<br>\
الحَقْحَقَة]. (TA.)<br>\
