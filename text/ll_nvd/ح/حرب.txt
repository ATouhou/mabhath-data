حَرَبَ, (Msb,)<br>\

exasperated. (S, K, TA.) And it is said to signify (assumed tropical:)  He acquainted a person with a thing that<br>\

hemzeh [in the places of ح and ب]. (TA.)<br>\

إِسْتَحْرَبَ see 1, last meaning.<br>\
حَرْبٌ War, battle, fight, or conflict; (Msb,<br>\
TA;) contr. of سِلْمٌ; (TA;) consisting, first, in<br>\
shooting arrows, one at another; then, in thrusting, one at another, with spears; then, in combating one another with swords; and then, in<br>\
grappling and struggling together: (Suh, TA:)<br>\
it is [generally] fem.; (S, L Msb;) but its dim.<br>\
is ↓ حُرَيْبٌ, without ة, (Kh, S, L, Msb,) contr. to<br>\
rule, (L, Msb,) like ذُرَيْعٌ, and قُوَيْسٌ, and فُرَيْسٌ<br>\
in a fem. sense, (L,) because originally an inf. n.<br>\
[of which the verb (حَرَبَ) seems not to have been<br>\
used as meaning “ he waged, or contended in,<br>\
war ”], (El-Mázinee, S,) or in order that it may<br>\
not be confounded with the dim. of حَرْبَةٌ: (Msb:)<br>\
Seer makes its origin to be the epithet حَرْبٌ,<br>\
which, however, is originally an inf. n.: (L:)<br>\
sometimes it is masc.; (IAar, Mbr, S, Msb, K;)<br>\
but this is extr.: (L:) the pl. is حُرُوبٌ. (S, K.)<br>\
You say, وَقَعَتْ بَيْنَهُمْ حَرْبٌ [War happened between them]. (S.) And قَامَتِ الحَرْبُ عَلَى سَاقٍ<br>\
The war, or battle, became vehement, so that<br>\
safety from destruction was difficult of attainment. (Msb.) And making it masc., as meaning<br>\
قِتَالٌ, you say حَرْبٌ شَدِيدٌ A vehement fight or<br>\
battle. (Msb.) [Hence,] اِبْنُ حَرْبٍ A warrior:<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA in art. بنى:) and اِبْنُ الحَرْبِ [the<br>\
warrior; or] he who suffices for war, and who<br>\
defends. (Msb in that art.) And دَارُ الحَرْبِ The<br>\
country, or countries, of the unbelievers, (Msb,)<br>\
or of [those called by the Muslims] the polytheists,<br>\
(K,) between whom and the Muslims there is<br>\
not peace. (Msb, K.) In the saying of Aboo-<br>\
Haneefeh, كَانَتْ مَكَّةُ إِذْ ذٰاكَ حَرْبًا, the meaning is<br>\
دَارَ حَرْبٍ [Mekkeh was at that time a place of<br>\
which the people were at war with the Muslims].<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  It is also an epithet; originally an<br>\
inf. n. (L.) You say رَجُلٌ حَرْبٌ, (K, TA,) [in<br>\
the CK حَرِبٌ, but it is] like عَدْلٌ, (TA,) A man<br>\
vehement in war, and courageous; as also ↓ مِحْرَبٌ<br>\
and ↓ مِحْرَابٌ: (K:) or ↓ مِحْرَبٌ signifies a man<br>\
of wars; (S;) or a man of war, as also ↓ مِحْرَابٌ;<br>\
and a known, experienced warrior. (TA.) [Being<br>\
originally an inf. n.,] حَرْبٌ as an epithet is used<br>\
in the same form as masc. and fem. and sing. and<br>\
pl.: (K:) so that one says اِمْرَأَةٌ حَرْبٌ and قَوْمٌ<br>\
حَرْبٌ, (TA,) as also ↓ قَوْمٌ مِحْرَبَةٌ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also An enemy, (S, K,) whether, or not, actually<br>\
at war. (K.) So in the saying, أَنَا حَرْبٌ لِمَنْ<br>\
حَارَبَنَىِ [I am an enemy to him who wars with<br>\
me, or who is an enemy to me]. (S.) And فُلَانٌ<br>\
حَرْبُ فُلَانٍ Such a one is the enemy of such a one.<br>\
(TA.) Some hold that حَرْبٌ is a pl. [or rather a<br>\
quasi-pl. n.] of حَارِبٌ or مُحَارِبٌ. (TA.)<br>\
حَرَبٌ inf. n. of حَرِبَ. (A, Mgh, Msb.) وَاحَرَبَا<br>\
is an ejaculation expressive of grief, lamentation,<br>\
or regret, [meaning Alas, my spoliation! or my<br>\
loss! or my grief!] (ISd, Mgh, TA,) used in an<br>\
absolute manner, like وَا أَسَفَا, (ISd, TA,) or<br>\
يَا أَسَفَا, (Mgh,) from حَرَبَهُ “ he despoiled him of<br>\
his wealth, or property: ” (K:) [or from حَرِبَ,<br>\
q. v.:] or it originated from the fact that Harb<br>\
the son of Umeiyeh, when any one died, used to<br>\
ask his family what they required to expend on<br>\
the occasion, and used to supply them therewith;<br>\
(TA;) and when he himself died, the people of<br>\
Mekkeh and its neighbourhood bewailed him,<br>\
saying, وَا حَرْبَا, (Th, K, * TA,) or وَا حَرْبَاهْ, (TA,)<br>\
[Alas for Harb!] and then they changed the<br>\
expression to وَا حَرَبَا, (Th, K,) or وَاحَرَبَاهْ, and it<br>\
became used in the case of bewailing any person<br>\
who was dear, and in the cases of other calamities:<br>\
but this account of the origin did not please ISd.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Perdition. destruction, or death.<br>\
(Har p. 158.)<br>\
حَرِبٌ: see حَرِيبٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also (tropical:)  Angry: (A:) or<br>\
violently angry: (S, K:) applied to a man and<br>\
to a lion. (S, A.) And i. q. كَلِبٌ [meaning<br>\
Affected with canine madness]: pl. حَرْبَى, (K,)<br>\
syn. with كَلْبَى, but unknown to Az in this<br>\
sense except in one instance. (TA.)<br>\
حَرْبَةٌ [A dart, or javelin;] a certain weapon<br>\
(K) resembling a spear, (Msb,) but smaller,<br>\
(TA,) having a wide head; (As, TA;) not<br>\
reckoned among رِمَاح: (IAar, TA:) dim. ↓ حُرَيْبَةٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) pl. حِرَابٌ. (S, A, Msb, K.) You say,<br>\
أَخَذُوا الحِرَابَ لِلْحِرَابِ [They took the darts, or<br>\
javelins, for contending in war, or battle]. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  A thrust, stick, or stab. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Spoliation.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Corruptness of religion. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  حَرْبَةُ<br>\
a name of Friday; (K, TA;) accord. to the<br>\
Námoos, because it is a time for warring with<br>\
oneself: (TA:) pl. حَرَبَاتٌ and حَرْبَاتٌ. (K.)<br>\
حِرْبَةٌ A mode, or manner, of war, battle, fight,<br>\
or conflict. (K.)<br>\
حِرْبَاءٌ [The male chameleon;] the male of what<br>\
is called أُمُّ حُبَيْنٍ; (S, Msb, K; [but see the<br>\
latter appellation in art. حبن;]) a well-known<br>\
animal: (TA:) or a certain reptile, like the<br>\
عَظَآءَة, (K,) said to be larger than this latter,<br>\
(Msb,) somewhat larger, (S,) that turns itself,<br>\
(S, Msb,) or its head, (K,) towards the sun, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) turning with the sun as the sun turns,<br>\
and assuming various colours (S, Msb) by reason<br>\
of the heat of the sun: (S:) Az describes it as a<br>\
reptile resembling in form what is called سَامُّ أَبْرَصَ,<br>\
with four legs, slender head, [which is not correct<br>\
as applied to the chameleon,] and striped back;<br>\
that all the day looks towards the sun; and he<br>\
adds that its flesh is impure, and the Arabs never<br>\
eat it: (TA:) [accord. to Freytag, the word,<br>\
thus applied, is said (but I know not on what<br>\
authority) to be from خُرْبَا, meaning حافظ الشمس<br>\
(guardian of the sun):] the fem. is with ة: (S:)<br>\
and the pl. حَرَابِىُّ. (S, Msb.) [The word حرباء<br>\
is used in passages cited in the TA as masc. and<br>\
fem.; whence it seems that it may be written<br>\
حِرْبَآءُ as well as حِرْبَآءٌ.] The Arabs used the expression حِرْبَآءُ تَنْضُبٍ or تَنْضُبَ, like ذئْبُ غَضًا:<br>\
(S:) [the latter word in each of these cases being<br>\
the name of a tree:] the former is proverbially<br>\
applied to a prudent man; because the حرباء does<br>\
not quit the first branch but to leap upon the<br>\
second. (TA.) The phrase اِنْتَصَبَ العُودُ فِى<br>\
الحِرْبَآءِ is used, by inversion, for انتصب الحرباءُ<br>\
فى العودِ [The male chameleon stood erect upon<br>\
the branch]: for it stands erect upon stones, and<br>\
upon the roots or trunks of trees, looking towards<br>\
the sun, and declines as the sun declines. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  The back: or its flesh: (K:) or حِرْبَآءُ<br>\
المَتْنِ means the flesh along either side of the<br>\
backbone: (TA:) or this, (TA,) or الحرباءُ, (K,)<br>\
the ridge of the backbone: (K, TA:) or حَرَابِىُّ<br>\
المَتْنِ (S, L, TA) signifies the portions of flesh,<br>\
(S,) or the flesh, (L, TA,) along either side of the<br>\
backbone: (S, L, TA:) the sing. is حِرْبَآءٌ; likened<br>\
to the حرباء [or male chameleon] of the desert,<br>\
and therefore tropical: Kr says that the sing. of<br>\
حَرَابِىُّ الظُّهُورِ is حِرْبَآءٌ accord. to rule; showing<br>\
that it has no known sing. on the authority of<br>\
hearsay. (L, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  The nails, (S,) or a nail,<br>\
(K,) of a coat of mail: (S, K:) or the head of<br>\
a nail in a ring of a coat of mail: (K:) pl. as<br>\
above. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And Rugged ground: (K:) or<br>\
rugged and hard ground; accord. to Th; but the<br>\
word commonly known is حِزْبَآءٌ, with záy. (TA.)<br>\
[This meaning has been supposed to be assigned<br>\
in the K to مُحْرَبِئَةٌ; but the TA shows that such<br>\
is not the case.]<br>\
حَرِيبٌ and ↓ مَحْرُوبٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ حَرِبٌ<br>\
(MF) Despoiled of his wealth, or property; plundered; (S, Mgh, Msb, K, MF;) and left without<br>\
anything: (S, Mgh, Msb:) pl. (of the first, TA)<br>\
حَرْبَى and حُرَبَآءُ. (K.) And حَرِيبَةٌ and ↓ مَحْرُوبَةٌ<br>\
A woman deprived of her child, or children. (TA.)<br>\
And ↓ محروب (assumed tropical:)  Despoiled of his religion; rendered, or become, an unbeliever. (TA.)<br>\
حُرَيْبٌ dim. of حَرْبٌ, q. v.<br>\
حَرَابَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
حَرِيبَةٌ (S, A, K) and ↓ حَرَابَةٌ (A) Wealth, or<br>\
property, of which one is despoiled, or plundered:<br>\
(A, K:) a man&#39;s property is not so called until<br>\
he has been despoiled of it: (TA:) or (K, but<br>\
in the A “ and ”) wealth, or property, by means<br>\
of which one lives, or subsists: (S, A, K:) pl. of<br>\
the former [and of the latter also accord. to analogy] حَرَائِبُ. (TA.)<br>\
حُرَيْبَةٌ dim. of حَرْبَةٌ, q. v.<br>\
حَرَّابَةٌ A troop of plunderers. (TA.)<br>\

to an explanation of the pl. مَحَارِيبُ, in the S,<br>\
on the authority of Fr,) or of a house, or tent, or<br>\
chamber; (K;) the chief, or most honourable,<br>\
sitting-place; (AO, L, Msb, K; *) whence, in a<br>\
trad., كَانَ يَكْرَهُ المَحَارِيبَ [he used to dislike the<br>\
