حَسَا, (S, Msb, K,) aor. يَحْسُو, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
حَسْوٌ, (S, Msb,) and some say that حَسْوَةٌ also is<br>\
an inf. n., (Msb,) [but this is properly an inf. n.<br>\
of un.,] He (a man) supped, or sipped, or drank<br>\
by little and little, (K,) soup, or broth, (S, K,)<br>\
or سَوِيق, and the like; (Msb;) as also ↓ احتسى<br>\
(S, K) and ↓ تحسّى, (K,) or the last means, in a<br>\
leisurely manner. (Sb, S.) You say also, حَسَوْتُ<br>\
حَسْوَةً وَاحِدَةً [I supped, or sipped, one sup, or<br>\
sip]. (S.) And حَسَوْتُ as meaning I drank [or<br>\
supped or sipped] what is termed حَسُوء and حَسَآء.<br>\
(ISk, TA.) [Hence,] كَأْسَ المَنَايَا ↓ اِحْتَسَوْا (assumed tropical:)  [They<br>\
sipped the cup of death; lit, deaths]: and ↓ اِحْتَسَوْا<br>\

-b2-  One says<br>\
also of a bird, حَسَا المَآءَ, (Msb, K,) aor. as above,<br>\
(Msb,) inf. n. حَسْوٌ, (Msb, K,) like as one says<br>\
of a man, شَرِبَ; (TA;) [He sipped the water:]<br>\
one should not say, in this case, شَرِبَ. (Msb, K.)<br>\
Hence the prov., (Msb,) نَوْمٌ كَحَسْوِ الطَّيْرِ [A<br>\
sleeping like the sipping of the bird] i. e., of<br>\
short duration; (S, M, Msb, TA;) likened, in<br>\
its quick ending, to a bird&#39;s swallowing water:<br>\
(Msb:) in the copies of the K, يَوْمٌ [a day];<br>\
and so in [some copies of] the S, and in the A.<br>\
(TA.) And the saying, نِمْتُ نَوْمَةً كَحَسْوِ الطَّيْرِ<br>\
I slept [a sleep like the sipping of the bird;<br>\
meaning,] a short sleep. (T, Msb. *)<br>\

الحُسَى ↓ لِمِثْلِهَا كُنْتُ أُحَسِّيكَ<br>\
[For the like thereof I used to give thee the<br>\
mouthfuls of soup to sup, or sip;] meaning (assumed tropical:)  for<br>\
the like of this case I used to act with goodness to<br>\
thee. (A, TA. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov.<br>\

حَسْوَةٌ A single act of supping or sipping; (S, *<br>\
K;) as also ↓ حُسْوَةٌ; but the former is the more<br>\
chaste: (K:) some say that these are dial. vars.,<br>\
like نَغْبَةٌ and نُغْبَةٌ, and جَرْعَةٌ and جُرْعَةٌ: but<br>\
accord. to Yoo, the former denotes the act, and<br>\
the latter is the [proper] subst. (TA.) See also<br>\
what next follows.<br>\
حُسْوَةٌ A sup, or sip; i. e. a small quantity of<br>\
what is supped, or sipped: (K:) or as much as<br>\
is supped, or sipped, (يُحْسَى,) at once: (S:) or<br>\
a mouthful of what is supped, or sipped; and<br>\
some say that ↓ حَسْوَةٌ is a dial. var.; but others,<br>\
that this is an inf. n. [of un.]: (Msb:) pl. حُسًى<br>\
[for an ex. of which see 4] (Msb, TA) and حُسْوَاتٌ<br>\
or حُسَوَاتٌ or حُسُوَاتٌ (Msb) and [of pauc.] أَحْسِيَةٌ<br>\

أَحْسُوَةٌ], and pl. pl. أَحَاسِى [or rather أَحَاسٍ], (K,)<br>\
which ISd thinks to be rather a pl. of ↓ حَسَآءٌ,<br>\
contr. to rule. (TA.) You say, فِى الإِنَآءِ حُسْوَةٌ<br>\
[In the vessel is a sup, or sip]. (S, Msb.) See<br>\
also حَسْوَةٌ.<br>\
حَسَآءٌ A well-known kind of food; (S;) soup;<br>\
i. e. what is supped, or sipped; (K;) thin cooked<br>\

(IAth, Msb,) such as is prepared for one who<br>\
has a complaint of his chest, (Sh,) made of flour<br>\
and water and oil or grease, and sometimes<br>\
sweetened: (IAth:) also called ↓ حَسُوٌّ (Sh, S,<br>\
Msb, K) and ↓ حَسِيَّةٌ (Sh, K) and ↓ and<br>\
↓ حَسْوٌ; (K;) the last two, the latter of which is<br>\
like the inf. n., mentioned by IAar, but regarded<br>\
by ISd as of doubtful authority. (TA.) See<br>\

حَسُوٌّ: see what next precedes. ―<br>\
