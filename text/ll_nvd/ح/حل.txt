حَلَّ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
حَلُ3َ, inf. n. حَلٌّ,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb,) He untied, or undid, (K, TA,)<br>\
or opened, (S,) a knot: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) this<br>\
is the primary signification. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
Hence, يَا عَاقِدُ اذْكُرْ حَلًّا [O tyer of a knot, bear<br>\
in mind the time of untying: or حَابِلُ O binder,<br>\
or tyer, of the rope: (see art. حبل:)] (S, TA:)<br>\
or, as IAar relates it, يا حَامِلُ [O loader]: a<br>\
prov., applied to the consideration of results; because a man may tie a load too tightly; and when<br>\
he desires to untie it, may injure himself and his<br>\
camel. (TA. [See also a similar saying below,<br>\
in the second paragraph.]) And الشُّفْعَةُ كَحَلِّ<br>\
العِقَالِ [The right of preemption is like the untying<br>\
of the cord with which a camel&#39;s fore shank and<br>\
arm are bound together]: meaning that it is<br>\
accomplished as quickly and easily as the عقال is<br>\
untied: the explanation that it passes away quickly,<br>\
like the camel when his عقال is untied, is improbable.<br>\
(Mgh, Msb. *) And hence the saying [in the Kur<br>\
xx. 28], وَ احْلُلْ عُقْدَةً مِنْ لِسَانِى (assumed tropical:)  [And loose Thou<br>\
an impediment of, or from, my tongue]. (Er-Rághib, TA.) The pass. is pronounced by some<br>\
حُلَّ, and by others حِلَّ: thus in the saying of<br>\
El-Farezdak,<br>\
فَمَا حِلَّ مِنْ جَهْلٍ حُبَى حُلَمَائِنَا<br>\
وَ لَا قَابِلُ المَعْرُوفِ فِينَا يُعَنَّفُ<br>\
[And the garments of our forbearing men by which<br>\
they support themselves in sitting by binding them,<br>\
or making them tight, round the shanks and back<br>\
are not loosed through ignorance, nor is the accepter of the benefit, among us, reproached]; the<br>\
kesreh of the first ل [in the original form حُلِلَ]<br>\
being transferred to the ح: but Akh heard it pronounced in this instance حُلَّ; and some, he says,<br>\
in this word, and in others like it, as رُدَّ and شُدَّ,<br>\
only impart to the dammeh somewhat of the sound<br>\
of kesreh, by the pronunciation termed إِشْمَام.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [He, or it, dissolved, melted, or liquefied,<br>\
a thing; as also ↓ حلّل, inf. n. تَحْلِيلٌ, often said<br>\
of a medicine as meaning it acted as a dissolvent.]<br>\
حُلَّ, (M, K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) meaning It<br>\
was dissolved, melted, or liquefied, is said of anything congealed, frozen, or solid. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[(assumed tropical:)  He solved a problem, or riddle, &amp;c. ―<br>\
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
analyzed a thing; as also ↓ حلّل, inf. n. as above.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  حَلَّ اليَمِينَ: see 2. ―<br>\
-b6-  From حَلُّ الأَحْمَالِ عِنْدَ<br>\
النُّزُولِ [The untying, unbinding, or loosing, of the<br>\
loads on the occasion of alighting], حَلَّ, inf. n.<br>\
حُلُولٌ, came to be used alone as meaning نَزَلَ [i. e.<br>\
He alighted; or descended and stopped or sojourned or abode or lodged or settled; and simply<br>\
he took up his abode; or he abode, lodged, or<br>\
settled; in a place]. (Er-Rághib, TA.) You say,<br>\
حَلَّ بِالْمَكَانِ (S, K) or بِالْبَلَدِ, (Msb,) and حَلَّ المَكَانَ<br>\
(S, Mgh, * K) or البَلَدَ, (Msb,) aor.<br>\
حَلُ3َ (S, Msb, K)<br>\
and<br>\
حَلِ3َ, (K,) both of which forms of the aor. are<br>\
mentioned by Ibn-Málik, (TA,) inf. n. حُلُولٌ<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K) and حَلٌّ (S, K) and حَلَلٌ,<br>\
which is extr., (K,) and مَحَلٌّ (S, TA) and مَحِلٌّ;<br>\
(TA;) and بِهِ ↓ احتلّ (S, * K) and ↓ احتلّهُ; (K;)<br>\
meaning نَزَلَ بِهِ [He alighted, or descended and<br>\
stopped &amp;c. (as above), in the place or the country<br>\
or town &amp;c.]. (Msb, K, TA.) And in like<br>\
manner, حَلَّ بِالقَوْمِ and حَلَّ القَوْمَ (S, ISd, TA)<br>\
and بِهِمْ ↓ احتلّ and ↓ احتلّهُمْ (ISd, TA) [He<br>\
alighted, or descended and stopped &amp;c., at, or in,<br>\
the abode of the people or party]; and حَلَّ إِلَى<br>\
القَوْم signifies the same. (TA.) And حُلَّ المَكَانُ<br>\
The place was alighted in, or taken as an abode;<br>\
(TA;) was inhabited. (K.) [Hence, in philosophy, حُلُولٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  Temporary or separable,<br>\
and permanent or inseparable, indwelling or inbeing: and حَلَّ بِهِ or فِيهِ (assumed tropical:)  It had, or became in<br>\
the condition of having, such indwelling or inbeing<br>\
in it. And حَلَّ بِهِ or فِيهِ is often said of joy and<br>\
grief and the like, meaning (assumed tropical:)  It took up its abode<br>\
in him. And كَذَا ↓ حَلَّ مَحَلَّ (assumed tropical:)  It took, or occupied, the place of such a thing.] ―<br>\
-b7-  And hence,<br>\
(TA,) حَلَّ الهَدْىُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
حَلِ3َ, (S, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. حِلَّةٌ and حُلُولٌ, (S, K,) (tropical:)  The beasts for<br>\
sacrifice arrived at the place where it was lawful<br>\
for them to be sacrificed, (S, K, TA,) or at the<br>\
place in which they should be sacrificed. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  حَلَّ said of a punishment has for its aor.<br>\
حَلُ3َ<br>\
and<br>\
حَلِ3َ, and the inf. n. is حُلُولٌ: (Msb:) [but it is<br>\
said that] حَلَّ العَذَابُ, aor.<br>\
حَلُ3َ, means (assumed tropical:)  The punishment alighted, or descended: and حَلَّ, aor.<br>\
حَلِ3َ,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  it was, or became, due, or necessitated by the<br>\
requirements of justice to take effect: it is said in<br>\
the Kur [xx. 83], فَيَحُلَّ عَلَيْكُمْ غَضَبِى (assumed tropical:)  [test my<br>\
anger alight upon you, or befall you]; or فَيَحِلَّ<br>\
عليكم (assumed tropical:)  [test it become due to you]; accord. to<br>\
different readings: (S, O:) or when you say,<br>\
حَلَّ بِهِمْ العَذَابُ, [you mean (assumed tropical:)  The punishment<br>\
alighted upon them, or befell them; and] the aor.<br>\
is<br>\
حَلُ3َ only: and when you say, حَلَّ عَلَىَّ, or لَكَ,<br>\
[you mean (assumed tropical:)  It became due to me, or to thee; and]<br>\
the aor. is<br>\
حَلَ3َ: أَنْ يَحُلَّ عَلَيْكُمْ غَضَبٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ [in<br>\
the Kur xx. 89,] means (assumed tropical:)  that anger should alight<br>\
upon you, or befall you, from your Lord [accord.<br>\
to those who read thus instead of يَحِلَّ; but the<br>\
latter is the common reading]. (TA.) You say<br>\
also, حَلَّ أَمْرُ اللّٰهِ عَلَيْهِ, aor.<br>\
حَلِ3َ, inf. n. حُلُولٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [The threatened punishment of God] was,<br>\
or became, due to him, or necessitated by the requirements of justice to take effect upon him.<br>\
(K.) And حَلَّ حَقِّى عَلَيْهِ, (Msb, * K,) aor.<br>\
حَلِ3َ,<br>\
(Msb, K,) inf. n. حُلُولٌ, (Msb,) or مَحِلٌّ, (K,)<br>\
(tropical:)  My right, or due, was, or became, a thing the<br>\

حَلِ3َ, inf. n. حُلُولٌ, (S Msb,) (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
debt was, or became, or fell, due; (K, * TA;) its<br>\

that the payment of it became due. (TA.) And<br>\
حَلَّ عَلَيْهِ الدَّيْنُ (assumed tropical:)  The payment of the debt became<br>\
obligatory on him. (Mgh.) ―<br>\

thing, S, Mgh, Msb) was, or became, lawful, allowable, or free; (S, TA;) لَكَ to thee: (S:)<br>\
contr. of حَرُمَ: (Msb, K:) a metaphorical signification, from حَلُّ العُقْدَةِ [“ the untying of the<br>\
knot ”]. (TA.) Hence the saying, الزَّوْجُ أَحَقُّ<br>\
بِرَجْعَتِهَا مَا لَمْ تَحِلَّ لَهَا الصَلَاةُ (assumed tropical:)  [The husband is<br>\
entitled to taking her back to the marriage-state as<br>\
long as prayer is not lawful to her]. (Mgh.)<br>\
And the saying, in a trad., لَمَّا رَأَى الشَّمْسَ قَدْ<br>\
وَقَبَتْ قَالَ هٰذَا حِينُ حِلِّهَا, i. e. [When he saw that<br>\
the sun had set, he said,] This is the time of its<br>\

إِحْرَام: (Msb, K:) this, also, is a metaphorical<br>\
signification, from حَلُّ العُقْدَةِ. (TA.) [Hence,]<br>\
فَعَلَهُ فِى حِلِّهِ وَ حِرْمِهِ, and وحُرْمِهِ ↓ فى حُلِّهِ, (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
did it when he was free from إِحْرَام and when he<br>\

عِدَّة. (Msb.) [And (assumed tropical:)  The woman became free<br>\

اليَمِينُ (assumed tropical:)  The oath [became discharged; and thus,]<br>\

K,) inf. n. تَحُلِيلٌ (Mgh, K) and ↓ تَحِلَّةٌ, (S, *<br>\
Mgh, K,) and ↓ تَحِلٌّ, which is anomalous, (K,)<br>\
or ↓ تَحِلَّةٌ is a simple subst., (Msb,) [and] so is<br>\
↓ حِلٌّ, (K, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He expiated the oath: (K:)<br>\
or (assumed tropical:)  he freed the oath from obligation by making<br>\
an exception, or saying إِنْ شَآءَ اللّٰهُ, or by expiation: (Mgh, Msb:) or (assumed tropical:)  he did that whereby he<br>\
became free from violating, or failing of keeping,<br>\
the oath; [generally meaning he made an exception in the oath, or he expiated it;] as also<br>\
↓ حَلَّهَا: (Msb:) and فِى يَمينه ↓ تحلّل (assumed tropical:)  he made<br>\
an exception, or said إِنْ شَآءَ اللّٰهُ, in his oath, (S,<br>\
Mgh, K,) immediately: (TA:) and مِنْهَا ↓ تحلّل<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  he became quit of it by expiation, (Mgh, TA,)<br>\
or by a violation of it requiring expiation, or by<br>\
making an exception, or saying ان شاء اللّٰه, in it.<br>\
(TA.) One says to him who goes to a great<br>\
length in threatening, or him who exceeds the<br>\
due bounds in what he says, أَبَا فُلَانٍ ↓ حِلًّا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Make thou an exception, or say ان شاء اللّٰه,<br>\
O father of such a one, in thine oath; regarding<br>\
him as a swearer: and in like manner one says,<br>\
↓ يَا حَالِفُ اذْكُرْ حِلًّا (assumed tropical:)  [O swearer, bear in mind<br>\
the making an exception, or saying ان شاء اللّٰه].<br>\
(S, * TA. [See a similar saying in the second<br>\
sentence of this art.]) In the saying لَأَفْعَلَنَّ كَذَا<br>\
ذٰلِكَ أَنْ أَفْعَلَ كَذَا ↓ إِلَّا حِلَّ, [the particle] الّا is<br>\
syn. with لٰكِنَّ; and the meaning is said to be,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [I will assuredly do such a thing: but] the annulling of the obligation, or the expiation, of [that]<br>\
my asseveration (قَسَمِى ↓ تَحِلَّةَ, or تَحْلِيلَهُ,) shall<br>\
be my doing such a thing. (TA.) One says also,<br>\
القَسَمِ ↓ فَعَلْتُهُ تَحِلَّةَ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  I did it only<br>\
enough to annul the obligation of, or to expiate,<br>\
the oath; not exceeding therein the ordinary<br>\
bounds. (S, Msb.) It is said in a trad., لَا يَمُوتُ<br>\
القَسَمِ ↓ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ ثَلَاثَةُ أَوْلَادٍ فَتَمَسَّهُ النَّارُ إِلَّا تَحِلَّةَ,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Three children of the believer shall<br>\
not die and the fire of Hell touch him]. save<br>\
enough to annul the obligation of, or to expiate,<br>\
the oath that is implied in the saying in the Kur<br>\
[xix. 72], “There is not any of you that shall not<br>\
come to it. ” (A&#39; Obeyd, S, TA.) Hence تَحْلِيلٌ<br>\
came to be applied to anything in which the ordinary bounds were not exceeded. (S, Msb.) One<br>\
says, ضَرَبْتُهُ تَحْلِيلًا, (S, TA,) or ضَرْبًا تَحْلِيلًا, (K,)<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  I beat him moderately; not exceeding<br>\
the ordinary bounds. (K, * TA.) And Kaab Ibn-Zuheyr says, speaking of the feet of a she-camel,<br>\
وَقْعُهُنَّ الأَرْضَ تَحْلِيلُ, meaning Their falling on<br>\
the ground is without vehemence. (S.) [In like<br>\
manner, also,] القَسَمِ ↓ تَحِلَّةَ is descriptive, by way<br>\
of comparison, of littleness; as is اليَمِينِ ↓ تَحِلَّةَ:<br>\
(Mgh:) or of anything occupying little time:<br>\
(TA:) and القَسَمِ ↓ إِلَّا تَحِلَّةَ, in the trad. cited<br>\
above, means (assumed tropical:)  [slightly, or] with a slight touch.<br>\
(Mgh.) A poet says,<br>\
أَرَى إِبِلِى جَدُودَ فَلَمْ تَذُقْ<br>\
مُقْسَمِ ↓ بِهَا قَطْرَةً إِلَّا تَحِلَّةَ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [I see my camels loathed the water of Jadood,<br>\
so that they did not taste in it a drop save sparingly]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  حلّل مَا بِهِ مِنَ الدَّآءِ, inf. n. تَحْلِيلٌ,<br>\

or sojourned or abode or lodged or settled, with<br>\
him; and simply he took up his abode, lodged,<br>\
or settled, with him; syn. حَلَّ مَعَهُ. (K.) You<br>\
say, يُحَالُّهُ فِى دَارٍ وَاحِدَةٍ [He takes up his abode,<br>\
lodges, or settles, with him in one house]. (S.)<br>\
And, of a woman, تُحَالُّ زَوْجَهَا فِى فِرَاشٍ [She<br>\
takes her place with her husband in a bed].<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\

and stop or sojourn or abide or lodge or settle;<br>\
and simply he made him to take up his abode,<br>\
to lodge, or to settle; syn. أَنْزَلَهُ; (S, K;) as also<br>\
↓ حللّٰهُ, and بِهِ ↓ حَلَّ: (K:) said also of a place<br>\
[as though meaning it invited him to alight, &amp;c.].<br>\
(ISd, TA.) So in the phrases احلّهُ المَكَانَ and<br>\
بِالْمَكَانِ, and المَكَانَ ↓ حللّٰهُ, He made him to<br>\
alight, or descend and stop &amp;c., in the place.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  احلّ بِنَفْسِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He caused punishment<br>\
(العُقُوبَةَ being understood) to alight, or descend,<br>\
upon himself; or] he did what necessitated, or he<br>\
deserved, punishment. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  احلّهُ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  God necessitated it, as suitable to the requirements of justice, to take effect upon him; namely,<br>\

also ↓ حللّٰهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,) inf. n. تَحْلِيلٌ<br>\
and ↓ تَحِلَّةٌ. (S.) Hence, [in the Kur ii. 276,]<br>\
أَحَلَّ اللّٰهُ البَيْعَ (assumed tropical:)  God has made selling to be<br>\

أَحْلَلْتُ المَرْأَةَ لِزَوْجِهَا (assumed tropical:)  I made, or have made,<br>\

him, or pronounced him, free from, or quit of,<br>\
