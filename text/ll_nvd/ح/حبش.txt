and حُبَاشَةٌ; (K, TK;) or حَبَشَ لَهُ حُبَاشَةً; (S;)<br>\

the K is in error in regarding حُبَاشَةٌ as an<br>\
inf. n.;] He collected for him something; as<br>\
also ↓ حَبَّشَ, inf. n. تَحْبِيشٌ: (S, K:) and ↓ تحبّشهُ<br>\
and ↓ احتبشهُ likewise signify he collected it. (TA.)<br>\
You say also, قَوْمَهُ ↓ حَبَّشَ, inf. n. تَحْبِيشٌ, He<br>\
collected his people. (S.) And حَبَشَ لِعِيَالِهِ, inf. n.<br>\

anomalous pl., (TA,) and wrong with respect to<br>\
rule, (T, M,) having no sing. of the measure<br>\
فَاعِلٌ, (M,) for they did not use حَابِشٌ as a sing.<br>\
thereof, like فَاسِقٌ as sing. of فَسَقَةٌ, (T,) but<br>\
الحَبَشَةُ became used as a dial. var., (T, Msb,)<br>\
commonly obtaining, for الحَبَشُ, (Msb,) and is<br>\
allowable in poetry in cases of necessity, (T,)<br>\
and ↓ الأَحْبُشُ, (IDrd, K,) also used as syn. with<br>\
الحَبَشُ, (IDrd,) or it is pl. of الحُبْشُ, with damm,<br>\

(S,) and الحُبُوشُ, (A,) [also a pl.,] and ↓ الحَبِيشُ,<br>\
which is also a pl., (TA,) [or rather a quasipl. n.,] and الأَحَابِشُ, which is likewise a pl.,<br>\
(K,) app. of أَحْبُشٌ, (TA,) and الأَحَابِيشُ, (A,)<br>\
[which is pl. of أُحْبُوشٌ,] A certain race of the<br>\
