not bent; (see a portion of the first paragraph of<br>\
art. ثنى, commencing with the second sentence;)]<br>\
i. e. such a one is not counted among the brethren.<br>\
(Th, TA.) And [hence] a poet says,<br>\
بَرَكَ الزَّمَانُ عَلَيْهِمُ بِجِرَانِهِ<br>\
وَأَلَعَّ مِنْكَ بِحَيْثُ تُحنَى الإِصْبَعُ<br>\
