حَكَمَهُ, (S, K,) [aor.<br>\
حَكُمَ,] inf. n. حُكْمٌ, (Msb,<br>\
K, [in the TK حَكْمٌ,]) in its primary acceptation,<br>\
(Msb,) He prevented, restrained, or withheld,<br>\
him (S, Msb, K) from acting in an evil, or a<br>\
corrupt, manner; as also ↓ احكمهُ: (K:) and<br>\
(K) from doing that which he desired; as also<br>\
↓ احكمهُ; and ↓ حكّمهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَحْكِيمٌ:<br>\
(S:) and حُكُومَةٌ [is another inf. n. of حَكَمَهُ,<br>\
and], accord. to As, primarily signifies the turning a man back from wrongdoing. (TA.) Ibrá-<br>\
heem En-Nakha&#39;ee is related to have said, ↓ حَكِّمِ<br>\
اليَتِيمَ كَمَا تُحَكِّمُ وَلَدَكَ, meaning Restrain thou<br>\
the orphan from acting in an evil, or a corrupt,<br>\
manner, and make him good, or virtuous, as thou<br>\
restrainest thine offspring &amp;c.: and of every one<br>\
whom thou preventest, or restrainest, or withholdest, from doing a thing, thou sayest, [حَكَمْتُهُ<br>\
and] ↓ حكّمته and ↓ احكمته: or, accord. to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed Ed-Dareer, as related by Sh, the forementioned saying of En-Nakh&#39;ee means let the<br>\
orphan decide respecting his property, when he<br>\
is good, or virtuous, as thou lettest thine offspring<br>\
&amp;c.; but this explanation is not approved. (Az,<br>\
TA.) And Jereer says,<br>\
سُفَهَآءَكُمْ ↓ أًبَنِى حَنِيفَةَ أَحْكِمُوا<br>\
إِنِّى أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمُ أَنْ أَغْضَبَا<br>\
[O sons of Haneefeh, restrain your lightwitted<br>\
ones: verily I fear for you that I may be angry]:<br>\
(S, TA:) i. e., restrain and prevent them from<br>\
opposing me. (TA.) You say, also, عَنِ ↓ احكمهُ<br>\
الأَمْرِ He made him to turn back, or revert,<br>\

-b2-  حَكَمَ الفَرَسَ,<br>\
and ↓ احكمهُ, and ↓ حكّمهُ, He pulled in the horse<br>\
by the bridle and bit, to stop him; he curbed,<br>\
or restrained, him. (TA.) And حَكَمَ الدَّابَّةَ, (S,)<br>\
or الفَرَسَ, (K,) inf. n. حَكْمٌ; (S; [so in my two<br>\
copies of that work;]) and ↓ أَحْكَمَهَا, (S,) or<br>\
احكمهُ; (K;) He put a حَكَمَة [q. v.] to the bit<br>\
of the beast, or horse. (S, * K.) ―<br>\

(MF.) ―<br>\
-b4-  حَكَمْتُ عَلَيْهِ بِكَذَا originally signifies<br>\
I prevented, restrained, or withheld, him from<br>\
doing, or suffering, any other than such a thing,<br>\
so that he could not escape it. (Msb.) [Hence<br>\
it means I condemned him to such a thing; as,<br>\
for instance, the payment of a fine or of a debt,<br>\
and death.] And hence, (Msb,) حَكَمَ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
حَكُمَ, (S, K,) inf. n. حُكْمٌ (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K) and حُكُومَةٌ, (K,) He judged, gave<br>\
judgment, passed sentence, or decided judicially,<br>\
بَيْنَهُمْ between them, (S, Msb, K, TA,) and لَهُ in<br>\
his favour, and عَلَيْهِ against him. (S, TA.)<br>\
And حَكَمَ عَلَيْهِ بِالأَمْرِ He decided judicially the<br>\
thing, or affair, or case, against him. (K, TA.)<br>\
And حَكَمَ لَهُ عَلَيْهِ بِكَذَا [He awarded by judicial<br>\
sentence in his favour, against him (i. e. another<br>\
person), such a thing]. (Mgh.) [And حَكَمَ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
He exercised judicial authority, jurisdiction,<br>\
rule, dominion, or government, over him. And<br>\
حَكَمَ بِكَذَا He ordered, ordained, or decreed,<br>\
such a thing.]<br>\
-A2-  حَكَمَ عَنِ الأَمْرِ He turned back,<br>\
or reverted, from the thing, or affair. (IAar,<br>\
Az, K.)<br>\
-A3-  حَكُمَ, (S, MA, TA,) with damm to<br>\
the ك, (S,) like كَرُمَ, (TA,) [not حَكَمَ as in the<br>\
Lexicons of Golius and Freytag,] inf. n. حُكْمٌ<br>\
(KL, MA) and حِكْمَةٌ, (MA,) He was, or became,<br>\
such as is termed حَكِيمٌ [i. e. wise, &amp;c.]. (S, KL,<br>\
MA, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And حكم, inf. n. حكم, [so in the<br>\
TA, without any syll. signs, app. حَكُمَ inf. n.<br>\
حُكْمٌ,] is said of a man, signifying He reached<br>\
the utmost point, or degree, in its meaning (فِى<br>\
مَعْنَاهُ [i. e., app., in what is the radical meaning<br>\
of the verb, namely, in judging; like قَضُوَ]); in<br>\
praising, not in dispraising. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
حكّمهُ, inf. n. تَحْكِيمٌ: see 1, in five places.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also [He made him judge; or] he committed<br>\
to him the office of judging, giving judgment, passing sentence, or deciding judicially; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) or he ordered him to judge, give judgment,<br>\
pass sentence, or decide judicially; (K;) or he<br>\
allowed him to judge, &amp;c.; (TA;) فِى الأَمْرِ in<br>\
the affair, or case. (K.) And حَكَّمْتُهُ فِى مَالِى<br>\
I gave him authority to judge, give judgment, pass<br>\
sentence, or decide judicially, respecting my property. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence, حَكَّمَتِ الخَوَارِجُ The<br>\
[schismatics called the] خوارج asserted that judgment (الحُكْمُ) belongs not to any but God. (Mgh.)<br>\
تَحْكِيمُ الحَرُورِيَّةِ, in the K, erroneously, ↓ تَحَكُّمُ<br>\
الحروريّة, (TA,) signifies The assertion of the<br>\
[schismatics called] حروريّة that there is no judgment (حُكْم) but God&#39;s, (K, TA,) and that there<br>\
is no judge (حَكَم) but God. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
حاكمهُ إِلَى الحَاكِمِ, (K,) inf. n. مُحَاكَمَةٌ,<br>\
(S,) He summoned him to the judge, and litigated<br>\
with him, (S, K, TA,) seeking judgment: and he<br>\
made a complaint of him to the judge; or brought<br>\
him before the judge to arraign him and litigate<br>\
with him, and made a complaint of him. (TA.)<br>\
And حَاكَمْنَاهُ إِلَى اللّٰهِ We summoned him to the<br>\
judgment of God [administered by the Kádee].<br>\
(TA.) بِكَ حَاكَمْتُ, occurring in a trad., is said<br>\
to mean I have submitted the judgment [of my<br>\
case] to Thee, and there is no judgment but thine;<br>\
and by Thee [or thy means or aid] I have litigated<br>\
in seeking judgment and in proving the falseness<br>\
of him who has disputed with me in the matter of<br>\
religion. (TA. [The past tense, here, is perhaps<br>\
used as a corroborative present.])<br>\

أَحْكَمَ see 1, in seven places. The saying of Lebeed, describing a coat of mail,<br>\
أَحْكَمَ الجِنْثِىَّ مِنْ عَوْرَاتِهَا<br>\
كُلُّ حِرْبَآءٍ إِذَا أُكْرِهَ صَلٌّ<br>\
is explained as meaning Every nail repelled the<br>\
sword from its interstices: [when it was struck<br>\
with force, it made a clashing sound:] or, as some<br>\
say, [the right reading is الجنثىُّ and كُلَّ, (as in<br>\
the S in arts. جنث and صل,) and, accord. to some,<br>\
صَنْعَتِهَا in the place of عوراتها, (as in the S and M<br>\
in art. صل,) and] the meaning is, the manufacturer thereof made firm, or strong, every nail<br>\
[of its interstices, or of its fabric: &amp;c.]: احكم in<br>\
this case signifying أَحْرَزَ [agreeably with the explanation here next following]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  احكمهُ,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِحْكَامٌ, (TA,) i. q.<br>\
أَتْقَنَهُ [He made it, or rendered it, (namely, a<br>\
thing, S, Mgh, Msb,) firm, stable, strong, solid,<br>\
compact, sound, or free from defect or imperfection, by the exercise of skill; he made it firmly,<br>\
strongly, solidly, compactly, so that it was firmly<br>\
and closely joined or knit together, soundly,<br>\
thoroughly, skilfully, judiciously, or well; he so<br>\
constructed, constituted, established, settled, arranged, did, performed, or executed, it; he put it<br>\
into a firm, solid, sound, or good, state, or on a<br>\
firm, solid, sound, or good, footing: and he knew<br>\
it, or learned it, soundly, thoroughly, or well; see<br>\
1, last sentence, in art. حنك]. (Msb, K.) Hence,<br>\
in the Kur [xi. 1], كِتَابٌ أَحْكِمَتْ آيَاتُهُ (TA) i. e.<br>\
[A book whereof the verses are rendered valid] by<br>\
arguments and proofs; (Bd;) or by command<br>\
and prohibition, and the statement of what is lawful and unlawful: (TA:) or disposed in a sound<br>\
manner, (Ksh, Bd,) with respect to the words and<br>\
meanings, (Bd,) like a building firmly and orderly<br>\
and well constructed: (Ksh:) or prevented from<br>\
being corrupted (Ksh, Bd) and from being abrogated: (Bd:) or made to be characterized by<br>\
wisdom, (Ksh, Bd:) as comprising the sources of<br>\
speculative and practical wisdom. (Bd.) And<br>\
hence one says of a man such as is termed حَكِيم,<br>\
[i. e. wise, &amp;c.,] قَدْ أَحْكَمَتْهُ التَّجَارِبُ [Tryings<br>\
have rendered him firm, or sound, in judgment].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, أُحْكِمَ عَنْ كَذَا It was secured<br>\
from such a thing: see مُحْكَمٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  [إِحْكَامٌ is also<br>\
often used as the inf. n. of the pass. verb, signifying The being firm, &amp;c.; or firmness, &amp;c.: see<br>\
مِرَّةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b5-  See also حَكَمَةٌ.<br>\
5<br>\
تحكّم فِيهِ He did [or decided] according to<br>\
his own judgment, or did what he judged fit, respecting it, or in it: (Msb:) or he had authority<br>\
to judge, give judgment, pass sentence, or decide judicially, respecting it; (K, TA;) as also<br>\
فيه ↓ احتكم: (S, K:) each is quasi-pass. of حَكَّمَهُ;<br>\
the former regular, and the latter irregular: (TA:)<br>\
or the former signifies he pretended to have authority to judge, &amp;c. (KL.) You say, عَلَىَّ ↓ احتكم<br>\
فِى مَالِى He had authority over me to judge, &amp;c.,<br>\
respecting my property. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 2.<br>\
6<br>\
تحاكموا إِلَى الحَاكِمِ They summoned one<br>\
another to the judge, [seeking judgment, (see 3,)]<br>\
and litigated; as also إِلَيْهِ ↓ احتكموا. (S, TA.)<br>\

استحكم He (a man) refrained from what<br>\
would injure him in his religion and his worldly<br>\
concerns. (Aboo-&#39; Adnán, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also quasipass. of أَحْكَمَهُ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) as signifying<br>\
أَتْقَنَهُ; (Msb, K;) [It was, or became, firm,<br>\
stable, strong, solid, compact, firmly and closely<br>\
joined or knit together, sound, or free from defect<br>\
or imperfection, by the exercise of skill; firmly,<br>\
strongly, solidly, compactly, soundly, thoroughly,<br>\
skilfully, judiciously, or well, made or constructed<br>\
or constituted or established or settled or arranged<br>\
or done or performed or executed: and, said of a<br>\
quality or faculty &amp;c., it was, or became, firm,<br>\
strong, sound, free from defect or imperfection,<br>\
established, or confirmed:] and, said of an affair,<br>\
or a case, it was, or became, in a firm, solid, sound,<br>\
or good, state, or on a firm, solid, sound, or good,<br>\
footing; as also ↓ احتكم. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  استحكم عَلَيْهِ<br>\
الأَمْرُ The thing, or affair, became confused and<br>\
dubious to him; syn. اِلْتَبَسَ: so in the A. (TA.<br>\
[But this seems to require confirmation.])<br>\
حُكْمٌ [inf. n. of 1, q. v.,] originally signifies<br>\
Prevention, or restraint. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,<br>\
(Msb,) Judgment, or judicial decision: (S, Msb,<br>\
K, TA:) or judgment respecting a thing, that it<br>\
is such a thing, or is not such a thing, whether it<br>\
be necessarily connected with another thing, or<br>\
not: (TA:) [whence,] in logic, [what our logicians term judgment; i. e.] the judging a thing to<br>\
stand to another [thing] in the relation of an attribute to its subject, affirmatively or negatively;<br>\
or the perception of relation or non-relation:<br>\
(Kull:) or it properly signifies judgment with<br>\
equity or justice: (Az, TA:) and ↓ حُكُومَةٌ signifies the same; (K, TA;) originally, accord. to<br>\
As, the restraint of a man from wrongdoing:<br>\
(TA:) [each, though an inf. n., being used as a<br>\
simple subst., has its pl.:] the pl. of the former is<br>\
أَحْكَامٌ, (K,) [properly a pl. of pauc., but] its only<br>\
pl. form: and the pl. of the latter is حُكُومَاتٌ.<br>\
(TA.) You say, وَ يَفْصِلُ ↓ هُوَ يَتَوَلَّى الحُكُومَاتِ<br>\
الخُصُومَاتِ [He presides over the affairs of judgment, and decides litigations]. (TA.) And it is<br>\
said in a trad., إِنَّ مِنَ الشِّعْرِ لَحُكْمًا meaning<br>\
Verily, of poetry, there is that which is true<br>\
judgment: so says Er-Rághib: or, as others say,<br>\
profitable discourse, such as restrains from, and<br>\
forbids, ignorant and silly behaviour; i. e., [what<br>\
contains] exhortations and proverbs profitable to<br>\
men: or, the right reading is, as some relate it,<br>\
↓ لَحِكْمَةً [i. e. wisdom, &amp;c.]: (TA:) or حِكَمًا [pl.<br>\
of حِكْمَة]. (So in a copy of the “ Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer ” of Es-Suyootee.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [The exercise of<br>\
judicial authority; jurisdiction; rule; dominion;<br>\
or government. See also حُكُومَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b4-  An ordinance;<br>\
a statute; a prescript; an edict; a decree; or a<br>\
particular law; like قَضَآءٌ. Hence the phrase<br>\
حُكْمَ العَادَةِ According to custom or usage; properly, according to the ordinance of custom or<br>\
usage. ―<br>\
-b5-  A rule in grammar &amp;c.; as when one<br>\
says, حُكْمُ الفَاعِلِ الرَّفْعُ or أَنْ يُرْفَعَ, i. e. The rule<br>\
applying to the case of the agent is that it be put<br>\
in the nom. case; and حُكْمُهُ حُكْمُ كَذَا, or كَحُكْمِ<br>\
كذا, i. e. The rule applying to it is the same as<br>\
the rule applying to such a thing, or like the rule<br>\
applying to such a thing. ―<br>\
-b6-  It may often be<br>\
rendered Predicament: (thus the last of the foregoing exs. may be rendered Its predicament is<br>\
the same as the predicament of such a thing, or<br>\
like the predicament of such a thing:) and حُكْمًا,<br>\
or فِى الحُكْمِ, predicamentally, or in respect of<br>\
predicament; and virtually; as distinguished<br>\
from لَفْظًا (literally), and حَقِيقَةً (really), and the<br>\
like.] ―<br>\
-b7-  Also Knowledge of the law in matters of<br>\
religion. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  See also حِكْمَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
It is a more general term than حِكْمَةٌ; for all حِكْمَة<br>\
is حُكْم, but the reverse is not the case. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
حَكَمٌ: see حَاكِمٌ, in two places; and مُحَكِّمٌ.<br>\
[Hence,] الحَكَمُ [The Judge] is one of the names<br>\
of God. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A man advanced in age (K,<br>\
TA) to the utmost degree. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
حَكَمَةٌ.<br>\
حِكْمَةٌ [properly, or primarily,] signifies What<br>\
prevents, or restrains, from ignorant behaviour:<br>\
(Mgh:) [in its most usual sense, which is wisdom,<br>\
agreeably with explanations here following,] it is<br>\
derived from حَكَمَةٌ, signifying a certain appertenance of a beast, [a kind of curb,] because it prevents its possessor from having bad dispositions:<br>\
(Msb:) it means knowledge; or science; (S, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ حُكْمٌ: (S, TA:) or [generally] knowledge of the true natures of things, and action<br>\
according to the requirements thereof; and therefore it is divided into intellectual and practical:<br>\
or a state, or quality, of the intellectual faculty:<br>\
this is the theological حِكْمَة: in the Kur xxxi. 11,<br>\
by the حِكْمَة given by God to Lukmán, is meant<br>\
the evidence of the intellect in accordance with<br>\
the statutes of the law: (TA:) in the conventional language of the learned, it means the<br>\
perfecting of the human mind by the acquisition<br>\
of the speculative sciences, and of the complete<br>\
faculty of doing excellent deeds, according to the<br>\
ability possessed: (Bd on the passage of the Kur<br>\
above mentioned:) or it means the attainment of<br>\
that which is true, or right, by knowledge and by<br>\
deed: so that in God it is the knowledge of things,<br>\
and the origination thereof in the most perfect<br>\
manner: and, in man, the knowledge and doing<br>\
of good things: or it means acquaintance with the<br>\
most excellent of things by the most excellent kind<br>\
of knowledge: (TA:) [and in the modern language, philosophy: pl. حِكَمٌ:] see حُكْمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
Equity, or justice, (K, TA,) in judgment or judicial decision; and so ↓ حُكْمٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
i. q. حِلْمٌ; (K, TA;) i. e. [Forbearance, or clemency, or] the management of one&#39;s soul and<br>\
temper on the occasion of excitement of anger:<br>\
which, if correct, is nearly the same as equity or<br>\
justice. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And Obedience of God: and<br>\
knowledge in matters of religion, and the acting<br>\
agreeably therewith: and understanding: and<br>\
reverential fear; piety; pious fear; or abstinence from unlawful things: and the doing, or<br>\
saying, that which is right: and reflection upon<br>\
what God has commanded, and doing according<br>\
thereto. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And [Knowledge of] the<br>\
interpretation of the Kur-án, and saying that<br>\
which is right in relation to it: so in the Kur<br>\
ii. 272. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And The gift of prophecy, or<br>\
the prophetic office; (K, TA;) and apostleship:<br>\
so in the Kur ii. 252 and iii. 43 and xxxviii. 19:<br>\
(TA:) or in the [first and] last of these instances<br>\
it means ―<br>\
-b7-  The Book of the Psalms [of David]:<br>\
or, as some say, any saying, or discourse, agreeable<br>\
with the truth: (Mgh:) and it also means [in<br>\
other instances] the Book of the Law of Moses:<br>\
(TA:) and the Gospel: and the Kur-án: (K:)<br>\
because each of these comprises what is termed<br>\
الحِكْمَةُ المَنْطُوقُ بِهَا, i. e. the secrets of the sciences<br>\
of the law and of the course of conduct; and<br>\
الحِكْمَةُ المَسْكُوتُ عَنْهَا, i. e. the secrets of the science<br>\
of the Divine Essence. (TA.)<br>\
حَكَمَةٌ [A kind of curb for a horse;] a certain<br>\
appertenance of a beast; so called because it<br>\
renders him manageable, or submissive, to the<br>\
rider, and prevents him from being refractory<br>\
and the like; (Msb;) or because it prevents<br>\
him from vehement running: (TA:) it is the<br>\
appertenance of the لِجَام [or bridle] that surrounds the حَنَك [or part beneath the chin and<br>\
lower jaw]: the Arabs used to make it of untanned<br>\
thong or of hemp; because what they aimed at<br>\
was courage, not finery: (S:) or the appertenance<br>\
of the لجام that surrounds the حَنَكَانِ [which<br>\
word app. here means the two jaws] of the horse,<br>\
and in which are [attached] the عِذَارَانِ [or two<br>\
side-pieces of the headstall, that lie against the<br>\
two cheeks]: (K:) or a ring which surrounds<br>\
the مَرْسِن [or part of the nose which is the place<br>\

(IDrd in his Book on the Saddle and Bridle:)<br>\
or a ring which is upon (فى) the mouth of the<br>\
horse: (ISh, TA:) pl. حَكَمَاتٌ (S, TA) and [coll.<br>\
gen. n.] ↓ حَكَمٌ. (TA.) Zuheyr says, describing<br>\
horses,<br>\
حَكَمَاتِ القِدِّ وَ الأَبَقَا ↓ قَدْ أُحْكِمَتْ<br>\
meaning قَدْ أُحْكِمَتْ بِحَكَمَاتِ القِدِّ وَ بِحَكَمَاتِ الأَبَقِ<br>\
[That had been curbed with curbs of untanned<br>\
thong, and with curbs of hemp]: (S, TA:) or,<br>\
accord. to Abu-l-Hasan, [the meaning is that had<br>\
been furnished with curbs &amp;c.; for he says that]<br>\
احكمت is here made trans. because it implies<br>\
the signification of قُلِّدَتْ: (TA:) some relate<br>\
the hemistich thus:<br>\
حَكَمَاتِ القِدِّ وَ الأَبَقَا ↓ مَحْكُومَةً<br>\
[furnished with curbs of untanned thong, and<br>\
hemp]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  The chin of a sheep (S,<br>\
K) or goat. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, of a man, (tropical:)  The fore<br>\
part of the face: (K, TA:) or, as some say, the<br>\
lower part of the face: a metaphorical term from<br>\
the حَكَمَة of the لِجَام: (TA:) or [in some copies<br>\
of the K “ and ”] (tropical:)  his head: [accord. to the<br>\
CK, or the fore part of the head of a man:]<br>\

station. (K, TA.) You say, رَفَعَ اللّٰهُ حَكَمَتَهُ (tropical:)  God<br>\
exalted, or may God exalt, his head, or his state,<br>\
or condition, and his rank, and station: because<br>\
the stooping of the head is a characteristic of the<br>\
low, or abject. (TA.) And لَهُ عِنْدَنَا حَكَمَةٌ (tropical:)  He<br>\
has rank in our estimation. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ<br>\
عَالِى الحَكَمَةِ (tropical:)  [Such a one is elevated in respect<br>\
of rank, or station.] (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [See also حَاكِمٌ,<br>\
of which it is a pl.]<br>\
حَكِيمٌ Possessing knowledge or science; [in its<br>\
most usual sense,] possessing حِكْمَة [as meaning<br>\
wisdom]; (S, TA; [see also أَحْكَمُ الحَاكِمِينَ;])<br>\
[wise; a sage: and in the modern language,<br>\
a philosopher: and particularly a physician:]<br>\
one who performs, or executes, affairs firmly,<br>\
solidly, soundly, thoroughly, skilfully, judiciously,<br>\

of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure<br>\
مُفْعِلٌ: (IAth, TA:) one who executes well, and<br>\
firmly, solidly, &amp;c., the niceties of arts: (TA:)<br>\

defect or imperfection; in which is no incongruity, nor any unsoundness. (TA.)<br>\
حُكُومَةٌ an inf. n. of حَكَمَ [q. v.]: (K:) [and<br>\
used as a simple subst.; pl. حُكُومَاتٌ:] see حُكْمٌ,<br>\
in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also [Judicial authority; authority to judge, give judgment, pass sentence, or<br>\
decide judicially, فِى أَمْرٍ respecting an affair,<br>\
or a case;] a subst. from اِحْتَكَمَ and تَحَكَّمَ; and<br>\
so ↓ أُحْكُومَةٌ. (K, TA.)<br>\
حَاكِمٌ One who judges, gives judgment, passes<br>\
sentence, or decides judicially; a judge; an<br>\
arbiter, arbitrator, or umpire; (S * Msb, K,<br>\
TA;) between people: (Msb, TA:) [one who<br>\
exercises judicial authority, jurisdiction, rule,<br>\
dominion, or government; a ruler, or governor:]<br>\
and ↓ حَكَمٌ signifies the same: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:)<br>\
the حَاكِم between people is so called because he<br>\
restrains from wrongdoing: (As, TA:) the pl.<br>\
is حُكَّامٌ (Msb, K) and حَكَمَةٌ, meaning judges,<br>\
[&amp;c.,] (TA,) and حَاكِمُونَ is allowable. (Msb.)<br>\
It is said in a prov., ↓ فِى بَيْتِهِ يُؤْتَى الحَكَمُ [In<br>\
his house the judge is to be come to]. (S. [See<br>\
Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 204.]) الحَاكِمُ [as<br>\
meaning The Supreme Judge] is one of the names<br>\
of God. (TA.) See also the next paragraph.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
[The pl.] حَكَمَةٌ also signifies Mockers, scoffers,<br>\
or deriders. (TA. [The ح in this case seems to<br>\
be a substitute for ه: see art. هكم.])<br>\
↓ أَحْكَمُ الحَاكِمِينَ [The most qualified to judge<br>\
of those who judge: or] the most knowing and<br>\
most just [of them]: (Bd and Jel in xi. 47,<br>\
where it is applied to God:) or it may mean<br>\
the wisest of those who possess attributes of<br>\
wisdom; supposing حَاكِمٌ to be [a possessive<br>\
epithet] from الحِكْمَةُ, like دَارِعٌ from الدِّرْعُ. (Bd.)<br>\
أُحْكُومَةٌ: see حُكُومَةٌ.<br>\
مُحْكَمٌ [pass. part. n. of أَحْكَمَهُ;] applied to a<br>\
building [&amp;c.,] Made, or rendered, firm, stable,<br>\
strong, solid, compact, &amp;c.; held to be secure<br>\

-b2-  And hence, A<br>\
passage, or portion, of the Kur-án of which the<br>\
meaning is secured (أُحْكِمَ) from change, and<br>\
alteration, and peculiarization, and interpretation not according to the obvious import, and<br>\
abrogation. (KT.) And سُورَةٌ مُحْكَمَةٌ A chapter<br>\
of the Kur-án not abrogated. (K.) And الآيَاتُ<br>\
المُحْكَمَاتُ, [see Kur iii. 5, where it is opposed<br>\
to آيَاتٌ مُتَشَابِهَاتٌ,] The portion commencing with<br>\
قُلْ تَعَالَوْا أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ [Kur vi. 152], to the<br>\
end of the chapter: or the verses that are rendered free from defect or imperfection, so that<br>\
the hearer thereof does not need to interpret them<br>\
otherwise than according to their obvious import;<br>\
such as the stories of the prophets; (K;) or<br>\
so that they are preserved from being susceptible<br>\
of several meanings. (Bd in iii. 5.) And المُحْكَمُ<br>\
The portion of the Kur-án called المُفَصَّلُ [q. v.];<br>\
because nought thereof has been abrogated: or,<br>\
as some say, what is unequivocal, or unambiguous; because its perspicuity is made free<br>\
from defect, or imperfection, and it requires<br>\
nothing else [to explain it]. (TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
مَحْكَمَةٌ A place of judging; a tribunal; a<br>\
court of justice.]<br>\
مُحَكَّمٌ فِى نَفْسِهِ [One who is made to judge<br>\
respecting himself: and particularly] one who<br>\
is given his choice between denial of God and<br>\
slaughter, and chooses slaughter. (Mgh.) In a<br>\
trad., in which it is said, إِنَّ الجَنَّةَ لِلْمُحَكَّمِينَ,<br>\
[Verily Paradise is for the مُحَكَّمُون], (S,)<br>\
لِلْمُحَكَّمِينَ, (S, K,) or, as some read, ↓ لِلْمُحَكَّمِينَ,<br>\
(K,) denotes a people of those who are called<br>\
أَصْحَابُ الأُخْدُودِ, who were given their choice<br>\
between slaughter and the denial of God, and<br>\
chose the remaining constant to El-Islám, with<br>\
slaughter: (S, K:) or المحكّمون means those<br>\
who fall into the hand of the enemy, and are<br>\
given their choice between [the profession of]<br>\
belief in a plurality of Gods, and slaughter, and<br>\
choose slaughter. (IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  المُحَكَّمُ occurring in a poem of Tarafeh, (S,) or this is a<br>\
mistake, and the right reading is ↓ المُحَكِّمُ, (K,)<br>\
An old man, tried, or proved, and strengthened<br>\
by experience in affairs; (S, K;) to whom<br>\
حِكْمَة [or wisdom, &amp;c.,] is attributed: (S:) or<br>\
both are correct, like مُجَرَّبٌ and مُجَرِّبٌ, as<br>\
several authors have allowed; the former meaning one whom events have controlled (حَكَّمَتْهُ<br>\
الحَوَادِثُ), and tried, or proved;  and the latter,<br>\
one who has controlled (حَكَّمَ), and experienced,<br>\
events. (MF.)<br>\
مُحَكِّمٌ, and its pl. مُحَكِّمُونَ: see مُحَكَّمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
المُحَكِّمَةُ is an appellation applied to the [schismatics called the] خَوَارِج because they disallowed<br>\
the judgment of the ↓ حَكَمَانِ [or two judges],<br>\
(S,) namely, Aboo-Moosà El-Ash&#39;aree and &#39;Amr<br>\
Ibn-El-&#39; Ás, (K, TA,) and said that judgment<br>\
الحُكْمُ) belongs not to any but God. (S.)<br>\
فَرَسٌ مَحْكُومَةٌ A horse [furnished with a<br>\
حَكَمَة; or] having a حَكَمَة upon his head. (Az,<br>\
TA.) See حَكَمَةٌ.<br>\
