and made [a thing] unlawful to him, or not allowable. (TA.) And تحجّر مَا وَسَّعَهُ اللّٰهُ He<br>\

حَجْرٌ: see حِجْرٌ, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  Also, and<br>\
↓ حِجْرٌ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K TA,) [the latter of<br>\
which I have found to be the more common in<br>\
the present day,] and ↓ حُجْرٌ, (K, [but this I have<br>\
not found in any other lexicon, and the TA, by<br>\
implication, disallows it,]) The حِضْن; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K;) [i. e. the bosom; or breast; agreeably<br>\
with explanations of حِضْن in the K: or] the<br>\
part beneath the armpit, extending to the flank;<br>\
(Mgh, Msb;) [agreeably with other explanations<br>\
of حِضْن;] of a man or woman: (S A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K:) pl. حُجُورٌ. (S, Msb.) Hence the saying, (Mgh,) فُلَانٌ فِى حَجْرِ فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is<br>\
in the protection of such a one; (AZ, T, Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) as also ↓ فى حَجْرَتِهِ. (TA.) And نَشَأَ<br>\
↓ فِى حِجْرِهِ and حَجْرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He grew up in his care<br>\
and protection. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also ↓ حِجْرٌ (T, K) and<br>\
حَجْرٌ (T, TA) [The bosom as meaning] the fore<br>\
part of the garment; or the part, thereof, between<br>\
one&#39;s arms. (T, K.) ―<br>\

-b4-  and<br>\
مَحْجِرُ العَيْنِ.<br>\
-A3-  Also An extended gibbous tract<br>\
of sand. (K.)<br>\
حُجْرٌ: see حِجْرٌ, in three places:<br>\
-A2-  and حَجْرٌ:<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  and مَحْجِرُ العَيْنِ.<br>\
حِجْرٌ (S A, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ حُجْرٌ (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ حَجْرٌ, (S, K,) of which the<br>\
first is the most chaste, (S,) and ↓ مَحْجَرٌ (S, K)<br>\
and ↓ حَاجُورٌ (K) [and ↓ مَحْجُورٌ], Forbidden,<br>\
prohibited, unlawful, inviolable, or sacred. (S,<br>\
A, Mgh, Msb, K.) Each of the first three forms<br>\
occurs in different readings of the Kur vi. 139.<br>\
(S.) You say, هٰذَا حِجْرٌ عَلَيْكَ This is forbidden,<br>\
or unlawful, to thee. (A.) In the time of paganism,<br>\
a man meeting another whom he feared, in a<br>\
sacred month, used to say, ↓ حِجْرًا مَحْجُورًا,<br>\
meaning It is rigorously forbidden to thee [to<br>\
commit an act of hostility against me] in this<br>\
month: and the latter, thereupon, would abstain<br>\
from any aggression against him: and so, on<br>\
the day of resurrection, the polytheists, when<br>\
they see the punishment, will say to the angels,<br>\
thinking that it will profit them: (Lth, S: *) but<br>\
Az says that I&#39; Ab and his companions explain<br>\
these words [occurring in the Kur xxv. 24] otherwise, i. e., as said by the angels, and meaning,<br>\
the joyful annunciation is forbidden to be made<br>\
to you: and accord. to El-Hasan, the former<br>\
word will be said by the sinners, and the latter<br>\
is said by God, meaning it will be forbidden to<br>\
them to be granted refuge or protection as they<br>\
used to be in their former life in the world:<br>\
but Az adds, it is more proper to regard<br>\
the two words as composing one saying: (TA:)<br>\
and the latter word is a corroborative of the<br>\
former, like مَائِتٌ in the expression مَوْتٌ مَائِتٌ.<br>\
(Bd.) The same words in the Kur xxv. 55<br>\
signify A strong mutual repugnance, or incongruity; as though each said what one says who<br>\
seeks refuge or protection from another: or, as<br>\
some say, a defined limit. (Bd.) A man says<br>\
to another, “Dost thou so and so, O such a one?”<br>\
and the latter replies حِجْرًا, or ↓ حُجْرًا, or ↓ حَجْرًا,<br>\
meaning [I pray for] preservation, and acquitment, from this thing; a meaning reducible to<br>\
that of prohibition, and of a thing that is prohibited. (Sb.) The Arabs say, on the occasion<br>\
of a thing that they disapprove, لَهُ ↓ حُجْرًا, with<br>\
damm, meaning, May it be averted. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Homeyd Ibn-Thowr says,<br>\
فَهَمَمْتُ أَنْ أَغْشَى إِلَيْهَا مَحْجَرًا<br>\
وَلَمِثْلُهَا يُغْشَى إِلَيْهِ المَحْجَرُ<br>\
meaning, And I purposed doing to her a forbidden action: and verily the like of her is one<br>\
to whom that which is forbidden is done. (S, K.)<br>\
↓ مَحْجَرٌ is also explained as signifying حُرْمَةٌ;<br>\
[app. meaning a thing from which one is bound<br>\
to refrain, from a motive of respect or reverence;]<br>\
and to have this meaning in the verse above.<br>\
(Az.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, the first of these words, Any حَائِط<br>\
[i. e. garden, or walled garden of palm-trees,]<br>\
which one prohibits [to the public]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
الحِجْرُ That [space] which is comprised by [the<br>\
curved wall called] the حَطِيم, (S, A, Mgh, K,)<br>\
which encompasses the Kaabeh on the north [or<br>\
rather north-west] side; (S, A, K;) on the side<br>\
of the spout: (Mgh:) or the حطيم [itself],<br>\
which encompasses the Kaabeh on the side of the<br>\
spout. (Msb.) [It is applied to both of these<br>\
in the present day; but more commonly to the<br>\
former.] ―<br>\
-b5-  Also, حِجْرٌ, The anterior pudendum<br>\
of a man and of a woman; and so ↓ حَجْرٌ: (K,<br>\
TA:) the latter the more chaste. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  A<br>\
mare; the female of the horse: (S, A, Msb, K:)<br>\
and a mare kept for breeding; (A;) as though<br>\
her womb were forbidden to all but generous<br>\
horses: (T:) but in the latter sense the sing. is<br>\
scarcely ever used; though its pl., the first of<br>\
the following forms, (as well as the second, A,)<br>\
is used to signify mares kept for breeding: (K:)<br>\
↓ حِجْرَةٌ, as a sing., is said by F and others to<br>\
be a barbarism: it occurs in a trad.; but perhaps<br>\
the ة is there added to assimilate it to بَغْلَةٌ, with<br>\
which it is there coupled: (MF:) the pl. [of<br>\
pauc.] is أَحْجَارٌ (Msb, K) and [of mult.] حُجُورٌ<br>\
(A, Msb, K) and حُجُورَةٌ. (K.) A poet says,<br>\
إِذَا خَرِسَ الفَحْلُ وَسْطَ الحُجُورِ<br>\
وَصَاحَ الكِلَابُ وَعَقَّ الوَلَدْ<br>\
When the stallion, seeing the army and the<br>\
gleaming swords, is mute in the midst of the<br>\
mares kept for breeding, and does not look<br>\
towards them, and the dogs bark at their masters,<br>\
because of the change of their appearances, and<br>\
children behave undutifully to their mothers whom<br>\
fear diverts from attending to them. (A.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
Relationship [that prohibits marriage]; nearness with respect to kindred. (Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Understanding, intelligence, intellect, mind, or reason:<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K:) so in the Kur lxxxix. 4: (S,<br>\
Bd:) thus called because it forbids that which<br>\
it does not behoove one to do. (Bd.) One says,<br>\
فِى ذٰلِكَ عِبْرَةٌ لِذِي حِجْرٍ In that is an admonition<br>\
to him who possesses understanding, &amp;c. (A.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
See also حَجُرٌ, in three places.<br>\
حَجَرٌ [A stone; explained in the K by صَخْرَةٌ;<br>\
but this means “a rock,” or “a great mass of<br>\
stone” or “of hard stone”]; (S, K, &amp;c.;) so<br>\
called because it resists, by reason of its hardness;<br>\
(Mgh;) and ↓ أُحْجُرٌّ signifies the same: (Fr, K:)<br>\
pl. (of pauc., of the former, S) أَحْجَارٌ (S, Mgh,<br>\
K) and أَحْجُرٌ (K) and (of mult, S) حِجَارٌ and<br>\
[more commonly] حِجَارَةٌ, (S, K,) which last is<br>\
extr. [with respect to rule], (S,) or agreeable<br>\
with a usage of the Arabs, which is, to add ة to<br>\
any pl. of the measure فِعَالٌ or of that of فُعُولٌ,<br>\
as in the instances of ذِكَارَةٌ and فِحَالَةٌ and ذُكُورَةٌ<br>\
and فُحُولَةٌ. (AHeyth.) And (metonymically,<br>\
TA) (tropical:)  Sand: (IAar, K;) pl. أَحْجَارٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] أَهْلُ الحَجَرِ The people of the desert,<br>\
who dwell in stony and sandy places: occurring<br>\
in a trad., coupled with أَهْلُ المَدَرِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
الحَجَرُ الأَسْوَدُ, and simply الحَجَرُ, The [Black]<br>\
Stone of the Kaabeh. (K, TA.) El-Farezdak<br>\
applies to it, in one instance, the pl. الأَحْجَارُ,<br>\
considering the sing. as applicable to every part<br>\
of it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  One says, فُلَانٌ حَجَرُ الأَرْضِ,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is unequalled. (TA.) And<br>\
رُمِىَ فُلَانٌ بِحَجَرِ الأَرْضِ (tropical:)  Such a one has had<br>\
a very sagacious and crafty and politic man<br>\
made to be an assailant against him. (K, * TA.)<br>\
El-Ahnaf Ibn-Keys said to &#39;Alee, when Mo&#39;á-<br>\
wiyeh named &#39;Amr Ibn-El-&#39;Ás as one of the two<br>\
umpires, قَدْ رُمِيتَ بِحَجَرِ الأَرْضِ فَاجْعَلْ مَعَهُ ابْنَ<br>\
عَبَّاسٍ فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَعْقِدُ عُقْدَةً إِلَّا حَلَّهَا (assumed tropical:)  Thou hast had<br>\
a most exceedingly sagacious and crafty and<br>\
politic man made to be an assailant against thee:<br>\
so appoint thou with him Ibn-&#39;Abbás; for he<br>\
will not tie a knot but he shall untie it: meaning<br>\
one that shall stand firm like a stone upon the<br>\
ground. (L from a trad.) One says also, رُمىَ<br>\
فُلَانٌ بِحَجَرِهِ, meaning (tropical:)  Such a one was coupled<br>\
[or opposed] with his like: (A:) [as though he<br>\
had a stone suited to the purpose of knocking him<br>\
down cast at him.] ―<br>\
-b5-  لِلْعَاهِرِ الحَجَرُ, occurring in<br>\
a trad., means (assumed tropical:)  For the fornicator, or adulterer,<br>\
disappointment, and prohibition: accord. to some,<br>\
it is meant to allude to stoning; [and it may<br>\
have had this meaning in the first instance in<br>\
which it was used;] but [in general] this is not<br>\
the case; for every fornicator is not to be stoned.<br>\
(IAth, TA.) [See also art. عهر.] ―<br>\
-b6-  الحَجَرُ Gold:<br>\
and silver. (K.) Both together are called<br>\
الحَجَرَانِ. (S.)<br>\
حَجِرٌ [Stony; abounding with stones]. You<br>\
say أَرْضٌ حَجِرَةٌ [so in several copies of the K;<br>\

حُجُرٌ The flesh surrounding the nail. (K.)<br>\
حَجْرَةٌ A severe year, that confines men to their<br>\
tents, or houses, so that they slaughter their<br>\
generous camels to eat them. (L in art. نبت, on<br>\
a verse of Zuheyr.)<br>\
-A2-  A side; an adjacent tract<br>\
or quarter; (ISd, K;) as also ↓ حَجْرَةٌ: (EM<br>\
p. 281:) pl. of the former ↓ حَجْرٌ, [or rather this<br>\
is a coll. gen. n., of which the former is the n. un.,]<br>\
and حَجَرَاتٌ (S, K) and ↓ حَوَاجِرُ: (K:) the last<br>\
is mentioned by ISd as being thought by him to<br>\
be a pl. of حَجْرَةٌ in the sense above explained,<br>\
contr. to analogy. (TA.) Hence, حَجْرَةٌ قَوْمٍ The<br>\
tract or quarter adjacent to the abode of a<br>\
people. (S.) And حَجْرَتَا الطَّرِيقِ The two sides<br>\
of the road. (TA.) And حَجْرَتَا عَسْكَرٍ The two<br>\
sides of an army; (A, TA;) its right and left<br>\
wings. (TA.) And قَعَدَ حَجْرَةً He sat aside.<br>\
(A.) And سَارَ حَجْرَةً He journeyed aside, by<br>\
himself. (TA.) And ↓ مَحْجَرًا is also said to signify the same, in the following ex.: تَرْعَى مَحْجَرًا<br>\
وَتَبْرُكُ وَسَطًا She (the camel) pastures aside, and<br>\
lies down in the middle. (TA.) It is said in a<br>\
prov., يَرْبِضُ حَجْرَةً وَيَرْتَعِى وَسَطًا He lies down<br>\
aside, and pastures in the middle: (S:) or فُلَانٌ<br>\
يَرْعَى وَسَطًا وَيَرْبِضُ حَجْرَةً Such a one pastures in<br>\
the middle, and lies down aside: (TA:) applied<br>\
to a man who is in the midst of a people when<br>\
they are in prosperity, and when they become in<br>\
an evil state leaves them, and lies down apart:<br>\
the prov. is ascribed to Gheylán Ibn-Mudar. (IB.)<br>\
Imra-el--Keys says, [addressing Khálid, in whose<br>\
neighbourhood he had alighted and sojourned,<br>\
and who had demanded of him some horses and<br>\
riding-camels to pursue and overtake a party<br>\
that had carried off some camels belonging to<br>\
him (Imra-el-Keys), on Khálid&#39;s having gone<br>\
away, and returned without anything,]<br>\
فَدَعْ عَنْكَ نَهْبًا صِيحَ حَجَرَاتِهِ<br>\
وَلٰكِنْ حَدِيثًا مَا حَديثُ الرَّوَاحِلِ<br>\
[Then let thou alone spoil by the sides of which a<br>\
shouting was raised: but relate to me a story.<br>\
What is the story of the riding-camels?]: hence<br>\
the prove., الحُكْمُ لِلّهِ<br>\
وَدَعْ عَنْكَ نَهْبًا صِيحَ فِى حَجَرَاتِهِ<br>\
[Dominion belongeth to God: then let thou alone<br>\
&amp;c.]; said with reference to him who has lost<br>\
part of his property and after that lost what is of<br>\
greater value. (TA.) [And hence the saying,]<br>\
قَدِ انْتَشَرَتْ حَجْرَتُهُ (assumed tropical:)  His property has become<br>\
large, or ample. (S.) ―<br>\
