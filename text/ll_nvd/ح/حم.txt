after shaving: (S, Mgh, TA:) [i. e.] the hair of<br>\
his head grew [again] after it had been shaven.<br>\
(K.) And hence, حمّم بِالمَآءِ, said of the hair,<br>\
It was rendered black by the water: because the<br>\

meaning أَعْطَى: so in the phrase, حَمَّمَهَاخَادِمًا<br>\
سَوْدَآءَ He gave her, after divorce, a black female<br>\
slave: or this may be for حَمَّمَهَابِهَا. (TA.)<br>\

حُمَّ,] aor.<br>\
حَمِ3َ, inf. n. حَمٌّ: (Msb:) it was, or<br>\
became, present: (K:) its time drew near, or<br>\
came; as also اجمّ: so says Ks; and thus this<br>\
last verb is explained by As; but he knew not<br>\
احمّ in this sense. (S, TA.) You say, أَحَمَّتِ<br>\
الحَاجَةُ and اجمّت The object of want became<br>\
near; (ISk, TA;) and both are mentioned by<br>\
Fr. (S.) And احمّ قُدُومُهُمْ and اجمّ Their<br>\

or he was, or became, anxious, disquieted, or<br>\
grieved, by night: (K, and Ham ibid.:) اِهْتِمَام<br>\
differing from اِحْتَمَام in being [often] by day:<br>\
(Ham p. 433:) and he slept not by reason of<br>\
anxiety, disquietude, or grief. (K.) And احْتَمَّتِ<br>\

pain. (K.) Also احتمّ لِفُلَانٍ He was, or became,<br>\

10<br>\
استحمّ He washed himself with hot water:<br>\
(S, Msb, K: or accord. to some copies of the<br>\
K, استحمّ بِالحَمِيمِ has this meaning:) this is the<br>\
primary signification: (S:) then applied, (S,<br>\

to mean he washed himself with any water. (S,<br>\
Msb. [See also 4.]) ―<br>\

حَمْحَمَةٌ is app. a word imitative of the cry of the<br>\
horse when he desires fodder; or when he sees<br>\
his master to whom he has been accustomed, and<br>\
behaves familiarly towards him: (TA:) or it signifies a horse&#39;s uttering a cry with a kind of<br>\
yearning sound, in order that his master may feel<br>\
tenderness for him; as also ↓ تَحَمْحُمٌ: (EM<br>\

and anything burnt by fire: (S, TA:) n. un.<br>\
with ة: (S, Msb, K:) which is tropically applied<br>\
to (tropical:)  live coals [or a live coal]. (Msb.) [Hence]<br>\

cooes; including the قَمَارِىّ and وَرَاشِين and<br>\
فَوَاخِت; whether it be, or be not, collared, or<br>\
ringed; domestic or wild: (Az, TA:) the flesh<br>\
thereof strengthens the venereal faculty, and increases the seminal fluid and the blood; the putting it, cut open while alive, upon the place stung<br>\

stops bleeding from the nose: (K:) the n. un. is<br>\
with ة; (S, Msb;) which is applied to the male<br>\

i. e. I saw a male [pigeon] upon a female [pigeon]:<br>\
(Zj, Msb:) accord. to ISd and the K, however,<br>\
حَمَامٌ should not be applied to the [single] male:<br>\

voce حُرٌّ, by the n. un. is meant a قُمْرِيَّة: the pl.<br>\
of حمامة is حَمَامٌ, (S,) [or rather this is the<br>\
coll. gen. n.,] and حَمَائِمُ (S, K) and حَمَامَاتٌ:<br>\
(S:) and sometimes حَمَامٌ is used as a sing.:<br>\
[so in an ex. above: and] Jirán-el-&#39;Owd says,<br>\
وَذَكَّرَنِى الصِّبَا بَعْدَ التَّنَائِى<br>\
حَمَامَةُ أَيْكَةٍ تَدْعُو حَمَامَا<br>\

pigeon, reminded me of youth, after estrangement]:<br>\
a poet also says,<br>\
حَمَامَا قَقْرَةٍ وَقَعَا فَطَارَا<br>\
[Two pigeons of a desert tract alighted and flew<br>\
away]: and El-Umawee cites, as an ex. of حَمَام<br>\
applied to the domestic [pigeons],<br>\
قَوَاطِنًا مَكَّةَ مِنْ وُرْقِ الحَمَى<br>\
[Inhabiting Mekkeh, of the pigeons of a white<br>\
colour inclining to black]; by الحمى [or rather<br>\
it should be written الحَمَا] meaning الحَمَام.<br>\
(S.)<br>\
حُمَامٌ The fever (حُمَّى) of camels; (S;) as also<br>\
↓ حُمَّآءُ: (TA:) or of all beasts, (K, TA,) including camels: (TA:) accord. to ISh, when camels<br>\
eat date-stones, [which are often given to them as<br>\
food,] they are [sometimes] affected with حُمَام<br>\
and قُمَاح; the former of which is a heat affecting<br>\
the skin, until the body is smeared with mud, or clay,<br>\
in consequence of which they forsake the abundant<br>\
herbage, and their fat goes away; and it continues in them a month, and then passes away.<br>\
(Az, TA.) ―<br>\

Pleiades (at the epoch of the Flight about the 13th<br>\

O. S.): or vehemence of heat]: (S, K:) or a period<br>\

May thy sweat be good, or pleasant; (Az, A, K;)<br>\
and consequently, may God make thy body sound,<br>\
or healthy: (A, TA:) or the former may mean<br>\

K,) imperfectly decl., because of the fem. alif<br>\
[which terminates it], (Msb,) A fever; a disease<br>\
by which the body becomes hot: from الحَمِيمُ:<br>\
said to be so called because of the excessive heat;<br>\
whence the trad., الحُمَّى مِنْ فَيْحِ جَهَنَّمَ [Fever<br>\
is from the exhalation of Hell]: or because of the<br>\
sweat that occurs in it: or because it is of the<br>\
signs of الحِمَام [i. e. the decreed, or predestined,<br>\
case of death]; for they say, الحُمَّى رَائِدُ المَوْتِ<br>\
[Fever is the messenger that precedes death], or<br>\
بَرِيدُ المَوْتِ [the messenger of death], or بَابُ المَوْتِ<br>\

(Mgh, K,) and fem. also, (Mgh,) generally the<br>\
latter; (Msb;) but some say that it is a mistake<br>\
to make it fem., (MF, TA,) though IB cites a<br>\
verse in which a fem. pronoun is asserted to refer<br>\
to a حمّام: (TA:) pl. حَمَّامَاتٌ; (S, Mgh, K;)<br>\
accord. to Sb, [not because the sing. is fem., but]<br>\
because, though masc., it has no broken pl. (TA.)<br>\
See also حَمِيمٌ.<br>\
حَمَّامِىٌّ The owner [or keeper] of a حَمَّام [or<br>\
hot bath]. (Mgh.)<br>\

-b2-  See also حَمِيمَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
i. q. عَامَّةٌ. (K.) [It would seem that this signification might have been assigned to it in consequence of a misunderstanding of the words in the<br>\
S, وَالحَامَّةُ الخَاصَّةُ يُقَالُ كَيْفَ الحَامَّةُ وَالعَامَّةُ: but<br>\
accord. to the TK, one says, جَاؤُوا حَامَّةً, meaning<br>\
عَامَّةً, i. e. They came generally, or universally.]<br>\
آلُ حَامِيمَ and ذَوَاتُ حَامِيمَ, (K,) or ↓ آلُ حٰم<br>\
and ذَوَاتُ حٰم, (S,) آل being prefixed in this case<br>\
in like manner as in آلُ فُلَانٍ, (Fr, S,) Certain<br>\
chapters of the Kur-án (S, K) commencing with<br>\
حاميم [or حٰم], (K,) [namely, the fortieth and<br>\
six following chapters,] called by Ibn-Mes&#39;ood<br>\
دِيبَاجُ القُرْآنِ: (S:) one should not say حَوَامِيم:<br>\
(K:) this is vulgar: (S:) but it occurs in poetry.<br>\

One of the names of God; (Mgh;) or it is the<br>\
most great name of God; (K;) occurring in a<br>\
trad., in which it is said, إِنْ بُيِّتُّمْ فَقُولُوا حٰم لَا<br>\
يَنْصَرُونَ, meaning If ye be attacked by night,<br>\
say ye حٰم; and when ye say this, they shall not<br>\
be made victorious: (Mgh:) or the meaning is,<br>\
[say ye] O God, they shall not be made victorious;<br>\
not being an imprecation; for were it so, it would<br>\
be لَا يُنْصَرُوا: (IAth, TA:) or it is an oath;<br>\
(Mgh, K;) and the meaning of the trad. is, [say<br>\
ye] By God, they shall not be made victorious:<br>\
but حٰم is not among the numbered names of<br>\
God: it has therefore been deemed preferable<br>\
to understand it as here meaning the seven chapters of the Kur-án commencing therewith: (Mgh:)<br>\
or it is an abbreviation of الرَّحْمٰنُ, wanting the<br>\
letters الرن to complete it: (Zj, K:) or, as some<br>\
say, it means [حُمَّ مَا هُوَ كَائِنٌ, i. e.] قُضِىَ مَاهُوَ<br>\
كَائِنٌ [What is taking place has been decreed].<br>\
(Az, TA.) It is imperfectly decl. because determinate and of the fem. gender; or because it is of<br>\
a foreign measure, like قَابِيلُ and هَابِيلُ, (Ksh,<br>\
Bd,) and determinate. (Ksh.)<br>\
أَحَمُّ Black; (S, K;) applied to anything; as<br>\
also ↓ يَحْمُومٌ, (K,) and ↓ حمِحِمٌ, (As, K,) or this<br>\
signifies intensely black, (S,) and ↓ حُمْحُمٌ, (K,) which<br>\
IB explains as a black hue of dye: (TA:) [the<br>\
fem. of the first is حَمَّآءُ: and the pl. حُمٌّ: and]<br>\
the pl. of ↓ the second is يَحَامِيمُ, and by poetic<br>\
license يَحَامِمُ. (Sb, TA.) You say, رَجُلٌ أَحَمُّ A<br>\
black man. (S.) And رَجُلٌ أَحَمُّ المُقْلَتَيْنِ A man<br>\
having black eyes. (TA.) And كُمَيْتٌ أَحَمُّ [A<br>\
blackish bay horse]: pl. كُمْتٌ حُمٌّ; which are<br>\
the strongest of horses in skin and hoofs. (S.)<br>\

And لَيْلٌ أَحَمُّ Black night. (TA.) ―<br>\

-b3-  And<br>\
أَحَمُّ An arrow before it has been furnished with<br>\
feathers and a head; syn. قِدْحٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  حَمَّآءُ<br>\
applied to a lip (شَفَةٌ) and to a gum (لِثَةٌ) means<br>\
Of a colour between دُهْمَةٌ and كُمْتَةٌ. (M, TA.<br>\
[See حُمَّةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  Accord. to some, (TA,) أَحَمُّ also<br>\
signifies White: thus having two contr. meanings. (K, TA.)<br>\

(S.)<br>\
مَحَمَّةٌ, applied to food [&amp;c.], (TA,) Any cause<br>\
of fever; or a thing from the eating of which one<br>\
is affected with fever: (K, * TA:) such, for instance, the eating of fresh ripe dates is said to be.<br>\

(M, K,) mentioned by AAF, but not known by<br>\
the lexicologists except as agreeable with analogy,<br>\
