حَنِثَ فِى يَمِينِهِ, (S, A, Msb, K, *) aor.<br>\
حَنَثَ,<br>\
(Msb, K,) inf. n. حِنْثٌ (S, * A, Msb, K *) and<br>\
حَنَثٌ, (TA,) He violated, or broke, or failed of<br>\
performing, his oath: (A, Msb, K, TA:) he was<br>\
untrue in his oath: (S, TA:) he committed a<br>\
sin, or crime, in his oath. (TA.) Also He retracted, or revoked, his oath. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And the<br>\
verb alone, He said what was not true. (Khálid<br>\
Ibn-Jembeh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He inclined from what was<br>\
false to what was true: or from what was true<br>\
to what was false. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And app. (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
committed a sin, or crime: a meaning which<br>\
seems to be indicated in the K: see حِنْثٌ, below.]<br>\
2<br>\
حنْثهُ He pronounced him (جَعَلَهُ) a violator,<br>\
or non-performer, of his oath: (Msb:) [a verb<br>\
similar to أَثَّمَهُ and فَسَّقَهُ &amp;c.]<br>\
4<br>\
أَحْنَثْتُهُ (S, K) فِى يَمِينِهِ (S) I made him to<br>\
violate, or break, or fail of performing, his oath.<br>\
(S, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  احنث فُلَانٌ قَسَمَ فُلَانٍ Such a one<br>\
assented not, or consented not, to the conjurement<br>\
of such a one; contr. of أَبَرَّ. (T and TA in<br>\
art. بر.)<br>\
5<br>\
تحنّث (assumed tropical:)  He put away, or cast away, from<br>\
himself الحِنْث, i. e. sin, or crime: (ISd, Towsheeh, TA:) it is said that there are only six<br>\
verbs of the measure of this signifying the putting<br>\
away, or casting away, from oneself a thing, [i. e.<br>\
the thing denoted by the root,] which are تحنّث<br>\
and تأثّم and تحوّب and تحرّج and تنجّس and<br>\
تهجّد: (TA:) (assumed tropical:)  he did a work whereby to escape<br>\
from sin, or crime: (IAar, Msb:) (assumed tropical:)  he applied<br>\
himself to acts, or exercises, of devotion; (S, A,<br>\
Msb, K;) accord. to Ez-Zuhree and the K,<br>\
during numerous nights; but it has been shown<br>\
by the Expositors of El-Bukháree, and others,<br>\
that this addition is taken from words following<br>\
the verb in the explanation of a trad., and has<br>\
nothing to do with the meaning of the verb itself:<br>\
(MF, TA:) (assumed tropical:)  he relinquished [the worship of]<br>\
idols; (S, K;) like تحنّف; (S;) and it may be<br>\
that the ث in this verb is interchangeable with<br>\
ف, (A,) or a substitute for ف. (TA.) You say<br>\
also, تحنّث مِنْ كَذَا (tropical:)  He abstained from such<br>\
a thing as a sin, or crime; syn. تأثّم, (S, A, K,)<br>\
and تحرّج. (A.) And تحنّث بِأَفْعَالٍ (assumed tropical:)  He sought<br>\
to bring himself near unto God, or to advance<br>\
himself in God&#39;s favour, by works [of devotion<br>\
&amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
حِنْثٌ The violation, or failure of performance,<br>\
of an oath: (S, A, K, TA:) [an inf. n. used as<br>\
a simple subst.:] pl. أَحْنَاثٌ; as in the saying,<br>\
عَلَيْهِ أَحْنَاثٌ كَثِيرَةٌ [He is accountable for, or<br>\
chargeable with, many violations, or failures of<br>\
performance, of oaths]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  A sin, a<br>\
crime, an offence, or an act of disobedience. (S,<br>\
A, Msb, K.) So in the saying [in the Kur<br>\
lvi. 45], وَكَانُوا يُصِرُّونَ عَلَى الحِنْثِ العَظِيمِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [And they persisted in great sin]; (A;) meaning belief in a plurality of gods. (Bd, Jel.) And<br>\
hence, (Bd in lvi. 45,) بَلَغَ الحِنْثَ (tropical:)  He (a boy)<br>\
attained to the age when he was punishable for<br>\
sin: (A, * Bd:) or attained to [the age when he<br>\
became punishable for] disobedience and [rewardable for] obedience: (S:) or attained to the age<br>\
when the pen [of the recording angels] began to<br>\
register his acts of obedience and of disobedience:<br>\
attained to the age of puberty: attained to manhood. (TA.) [Hence also,] أَوْلَادُ الحِنْثِ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
children of adultery or fornication: occurring<br>\
in a trad., accord. to one reading: accord. to<br>\
another reading, اولاد الخُبْثِ. (L.)<br>\
حَانِثٌ Violating, or failing to perform, his<br>\
oath; or a violator, or non-performer, of his<br>\
oath. (Msb.)<br>\
مَحْنَثٌ: see مَحَانِثُ.<br>\
مُحْنِثٌ A thing respecting which people differ,<br>\
and which admits of its being regarded in two<br>\
different ways; as also مُحْلِفٌ. (L.) [So called<br>\
because it may make one to be untrue in an<br>\
oath.]<br>\
مَحَانِثُ, accord. to some, having no sing.;<br>\
but accord. to others, its sing. is ↓ مَحْنَثٌ, and<br>\
this is app. the truth, and is agreeable with analogy;<br>\
(MF;) Places [i. e. occasions] of falling into the<br>\
violation of an oath or oaths, or (assumed tropical:)  into sin or<br>\
crime; expl. by مَوَاقِعُ حِنْثٍ (TA) and مَوَاقِعُ<br>\
إِثْمٍ. (K.)<br>\
