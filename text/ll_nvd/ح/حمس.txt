of Keys, consisting of [the tribes of] Fahm and<br>\
and &#39;Adwán the two sons of &#39;Amr the son of Keys<br>\
the son of &#39;Eylán, and the Benoo- &#39;Ámir Ibn-<br>\
Saasa&#39;ah, (AHeyth, TA,) and their followers in<br>\
the Time of Ignorance; (K;) or to Kureysh and<br>\
their coreligionists; (Mgh;) because of the hardships which they imposed upon themselves in<br>\
matters of religion, (S, A, Mgh, K,) as well as in<br>\
courage, (TA,) for they used not to enjoy the<br>\
shade in the days of Minè, nor to enter the houses<br>\
by their doors, (S, Mgh, TA,) while they were in<br>\
the state of إِحْرَام, (TA,) nor to clarify butter, nor<br>\
to pick up [dung such as is called] جَلَّة, (S, L,)<br>\
or بَعْر, (TA,) [for fuel,] and they dwelt in the<br>\
Haram, (AHeyth, TA,) and did not go forth in<br>\
the days of the مَوْسِم to &#39;Arafát, but halted at<br>\
El-Muzdelifeh, (AHeyth, Mgh, TA,) saying,<br>\
“ We are the people of God, and we go not forth<br>\
from the Haram: ” (AHeyth, TA:) or they were<br>\
thus called because they made their abode in the<br>\
Haram: (Sgh, TA:) or because they betook<br>\
themselves for refuge to the حَمْسَآء (الحَمْسَآءُ),<br>\
which is the Kaabeh, so called because its stones<br>\
are white inclining to blackness: (K:) the Benoo-<br>\
&#39;Ámir were of the حُمْس, though not of the inhabitants of the Haram, because their mother was<br>\
of the tribe of Kureysh: the term الأَحْمَاسُ also,<br>\
[pl. of ↓ حَمِسٌ or of ↓ حَمِيسٌ,] is applied to those<br>\
of the Arabs whose mothers were of the tribe of<br>\
Kureysh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also Courageous; (Sb, S,<br>\
K;) and so ↓ حَمِيسٌ and ↓ حَمِسٌ: (K:) pl. [of the<br>\
first, masc. only,] أَحَامِسُ and [masc. and fem.]<br>\
حُمْسٌ and [of the second or third] أَحْمَاسٌ. (TA.)<br>\
الأَحَامِسُ is also said to be applied to The tribe of<br>\
Kureysh: or, accord. to some, to the Benoo-<br>\
&#39;Ámir, because descendants of Kureysh: the<br>\
former is said by IAar. (TA.) ―<br>\

هِنْدَ الأَحَامِسِ, (L,) (tropical:)  He fell into distress (A, L)<br>\
and trial: (A:) or into calamity: (K:) or he<br>\
died: (K:) or the latter phrase has this last<br>\

the name of a courageous people of the Arabs.<br>\
(A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  عَامٌ أَحْمَسُ, (S, A, K,) and سَنَةٌ حَمْسَآءُ,<br>\
(K,) (tropical:)  A severe year. (S, A, K.) They say also<br>\
سِنُونَ أَحَامِسُ (tropical:)  Severe years: (K:) the masc.<br>\
form [of the epithet] being used because by سنون<br>\
is meant أَعْوَامٌ; or the epithet being used after<br>\
the manner of a subst.: (ISd, TA:) and سِنُونَ<br>\
حُمْسٌ signifies the same: (K:) or the latter,<br>\
years of hunger. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\

(tropical:)  A sterile, barren, or unfruitful, and narrow,<br>\
land: (A:) or a land in which is no herbage nor<br>\
pasturage nor rain nor anything. (TA.) And<br>\
أَرَضُونَ أَحَامِسُ (tropical:)  Sterile, barren, or unfruitful,<br>\
lands. (S, L.)<br>\
مُتَحَمِّسٌ: see أَحْمسُ, second signification.<br>\
