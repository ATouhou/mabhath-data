أَحْمَرُ [Red: and also brown, or the like:] a<br>\
thing of the colour termed حُمْرَةٌ: (Msb, K:) it is<br>\
in animals, and in garments &amp;c.; and, accord. to<br>\
IAar, in water [when muddy]: and so ↓ يَحْمُورٌ:<br>\
(K:) fem. of the former حَمْرَآءُ: (Msb:) pl. حُمْرٌ<br>\
and حُمْرَانٌ: (K:) or when it means dyed with<br>\
the colour termed حُمْرَةٌ, the pl. is حُمْرٌ (S, Msb)<br>\
and حُمْرَانٌ; for you say ثِيَابٌ حُمْرٌ and حُمْرَانٌ<br>\
[red garments]: (TA:) but if you apply it as an<br>\
epithet to a man, [in which case it has other<br>\
meanings than those explained above, as will be<br>\
shown in what follows,] the pl. is أَحَامِرُ (S)<br>\
and حُمْرٌ: (TA:) or if it means a thing having<br>\
the colour termed حُمْرَةٌ, the pl. is أَحَامِرُ, because,<br>\
in this case, it is a subst., not an epithet. (Msb.)<br>\
↓ أَحْمَرِىٌّ also signifies the same as أَحْمَرُ: (Ham<br>\
p. 379:) or, as some say, it has an intensive<br>\
sense. (TA voce كَرُوبِيُّونَ.) It is said in the S,<br>\
in art. دك, that حَمْرَاوَاتٌ is a pl. of حَمْرَآءُ, like<br>\
as دَكَّاوَاتٌ, is of دَكَّآءُ; but it is not so. (IB in<br>\
that art.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to a camel, Of a colour<br>\
like that of saffron when a garment is dyed<br>\
with it so that it stands up by reason of<br>\
[the thickness of] the dye: (TA:) or of an unmixed red colour; (As, S in art. كمت, and<br>\
TA;) and so the fem. when applied to a she-goat. (TA.) It is said that, of she-camels, the<br>\
حَمْرَآء is the most able to endure the summer<br>\
midday-heat; and the وَرْقَآء, to endure nightjourneying; and that the صَهْبَآء is the most notable<br>\
and the most beautiful to look at: so said Aboo-Nasr En-Na&#39;ámee: and the Arabs say that the<br>\
best of camels are the حُمْر and the صُهْب. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence,] حُمْرُ النَّعَمِ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The high-bred, or<br>\
excellent, of camels: and is proverbially applied to<br>\
anything highly prized, precious, valuable, or<br>\
excellent. (Mgh, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Applied to a man,<br>\
(AA, Sh, Az,) White (AA, Sh, Az, K) in complexion; (Az;) because أَبْيَضُ might be considered as of evil omen [implying the meaning<br>\
of leprosy]: (AA, Sh:) or, accord. to Th, because<br>\
the latter epithet, applied to a man, was only<br>\
used by the Arabs as signifying “ pure,” or “ free<br>\
from faults: ” but they sometimes used this latter<br>\
epithet in the sense of “ white in complexion,”<br>\
applied to a man &amp;c.: (IAth:) fem., in the same<br>\
sense, حَمْرَآءُ: the dim. of which, ↓ حُمَيْرَآءُ, occurs<br>\
in a trad., applied to &#39;Áïsheh. (K, * TA.) So,<br>\
accord. to some, in the trad., بُعِثْتُ إِلَى الأَحْمَرِ<br>\
وَالأَسْوَدِ, (TA,) i. e. I have been sent to the white<br>\
and the black; because these two epithets comprise all mankind: (Az, TA:) [therefore, by the<br>\
former we should understand the white and the<br>\
red races; and by the latter, the negroes: but<br>\
some hold that by the former are meant the<br>\
foreigners, and] by the latter are meant the<br>\
Arabs. (TA.) One says also, [when speaking of<br>\
Arabs and more northern races,] أَتَانِى كُلُّ أَسْوَدَ<br>\
مِنْهُمْ وَأَحْمَرَ, meaning Every Arab of them, and<br>\
foreigner, came to me: and one should not say,<br>\
in this sense, أَبْيَضَ. (AA, As, S.) الحَمْرَآءُ, also,<br>\
is applied to The foreigners (العَجَمُ) [collectively];<br>\
(S, A, K;) because a reddish white is the prevailing hue of their complexion: (S:) or the<br>\
Persians and Greeks: or those foreigners mostly<br>\
characterized by whiteness of complexion; as the<br>\
Greeks and Persians. (TA.) You say, لَيْسَ فِى<br>\
الحَمْرَآءِ مِثْلُهُ There is not among the foreigners<br>\
(العَجَم) the like of him. (A.) And accord. to<br>\
some, الأَحْمَرُ وَالأَبْيَضُ means The Arabs and the<br>\
foreigners. (TA.) الحَمْرَآءُ [so in the TA, but<br>\
correctly أَبْنَآءُ الحَمْرَآءِ,] is an appellation applied to<br>\
Emancipated slaves: and اِبْنُ حَمْرَآءِ العِجَانِ,<br>\
meaning Son of the female slave, is an appellation<br>\
used in reviling and blaming. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also<br>\
(tropical:)  A man having no weapons with him: pl. حُمْرٌ<br>\
(A, K) and حُمْرَانٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  الحُسْنُ أَحْمَرُ means<br>\
Beauty is in الحُمْرَة [app. fairness of complexion; i. e. beauty is fair-complexioned]: (TA:)<br>\
or (assumed tropical:)  beauty is attended by difficulty; i. e. he who<br>\
loves beauty must bear difficulty, or distress:<br>\
(IAth:) or the lover experiences from beauty<br>\
what is experienced from war. (ISd, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
الأَحْمَرُ A sort of dates: (K:) so called because<br>\
of their colour. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  الأَحْمَرُ وَالأَبْيَضُ Gold<br>\
and silver. (TA.) And الأَحْمَرَانِ Flesh-meat and<br>\
wine; (S, A, K;) said to destroy men: (S:) so<br>\
in the saying, نَحْنُ مِنْ أَهْلِ الأَسْوَدَيْنِ لَا الأَحْمَرَيْنِ<br>\
We are of the people of dates and water, not of<br>\
