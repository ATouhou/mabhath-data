مِحْلَاج upon the مِحْلَج, (TA,) or upon the<br>\
مِحْلَجَة. (A.) [Golius describes the operation<br>\
thus: “ e nucibus parum excerptum, inter ferramenta duo (quorum superius, axiculo seu specillo<br>\
simile, ceu torno vertitur, inferius quiescit, simul<br>\
autem inter sese arcte cohærent,) attrahitur et à<br>\
semine duriore segregatur: ” but see مِحْلَاجٌ and<br>\
مِحْلَجٌ.] ―<br>\

with the مِحْلَاج. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  He mixed, and<br>\

and ما تَخَلَّجَ (tropical:)  [Leave thou that which has been<br>\
doubtful in thy mind]. (Lth, TA.) تحلّج فِى<br>\

(As, TA:) or both mean nearly the same. (Sh,<br>\
TA.) The saying of &#39;Adee, (K,) [or,] correctly,<br>\

(Sh, K, TA.) Accord. to IAth, this is from<br>\
↓ حَلْجٌ, signifying motion, and commotion, or<br>\
agitation: and it is also related with خ [in the<br>\
place of ح], meaning the same. (TA.)<br>\

for نَحًى, and, if so, the meaning is the expressed<br>\
juice of the species of dates termed نَحًى]): (S,<br>\
K:) and the expressed juice of حِنَّآء: and some<br>\
fresh butter milked upon: (K:) pl. حُلُجٌ:<br>\
accord. to the T, حُلُجٌ signifies dates with milk:<br>\
(TA:) and accord. to Kr, ↓ حَلِيجٌ, without ة, is<br>\

[kind of tree called] رِمْث: (S, K:) or of the kind<br>\
called أَصْدَاف [i. e. of the testaceous kind, or<br>\
shell-kind: applied in the present day to the snail<br>\
with its shell, and to any kind of spiral shell]:<br>\
(K:) it is a kind of worm, having a shell within<br>\
which it conceals itself: (TA in art. حلزن:) its<br>\
flesh is good for the stomach, and for the wound<br>\
of the mad dog, and for dissolving hard tumours,<br>\
and curing ulcers; its shell, burnt, clears the<br>\
mange, or scab, and the [species of leprosy termed]<br>\
بَهَق [q. v.], and the teeth; and the application<br>\
of it externally draws forth the سَلَا [or perhaps<br>\
it should be سُلَّآء (or prickles of the palm-tree)]<br>\
from within the flesh, and, mixed with vinegar,<br>\
stops bleeding from the nose: (K in art. حلزن:)<br>\
Az agrees with the author of the K in mentioning<br>\
this as a triliteral-radical word; but As and J<br>\
hold the ن to be a radical letter, (TA in art.<br>\
حلز,) and so do Lth and A &#39;Obeyd. (TA in art.<br>\
حلزن.)<br>\
