heavy burden from one: or, (tropical:)  of the heavy burden<br>\
of sin: or merely a putting down thereof:] a<br>\
subst. from استحطّهُ وِزْرَهُ, explained above; as<br>\
also ↓ حِطِّيطَى. (K.) It is said in the Kur [ii.<br>\
55, and vii. 161], وَ قُولُوا حِطَّةٌ; i. e. they were<br>\
told to say حِطَّةٌ for the purpose of asking thereby<br>\
for the putting down of their heavy burdens from<br>\
them, and they should be put down from them:<br>\
(Ibn-Isráeel, TA:) the meaning is, And say ye,<br>\
Put Thou down from us our heavy burdens, (S,<br>\
TA,) or (tropical:)  our sins: (Ibn-&#39; Arafeh, K:) or [and<br>\
say ye,] Our petition is حِطَّةٌ; i. e. that Thou<br>\
wouldest put down from us our sins: (Aboo-Is-<br>\
hák, K:) or, accord. to some, حِطَّة is a word<br>\
which the children of Israel were commanded to<br>\
say; and if they said it, their heavy burdens, or<br>\
sins, were put down: (S, TA:) accord. to IAar,<br>\
it is the saying لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ: (TA:) or it means<br>\
forgiveness: (I&#39; Ab:) or our affair is an alighting<br>\
and abiding in this town: (Bd in ii. 55:) and<br>\
there is another reading, وَ قُولُوا حِطَّةً, which is<br>\
explained in two ways; either by making the<br>\
verb to govern the noun, as though he had said,<br>\
and say ye a saying which shall put down from<br>\
you your heavy burdens, or (tropical:)  sins; or by making<br>\
the noun to be in the accus. case as an inf. n.<br>\
meaning supplicating and petitioning [that God<br>\
may put down from you your heavy burdens, or<br>\
(tropical:)  sins]; i. e. اُحْطُطِ اللَّهُمَّ أَوْزَارَنَا حِطَّةً: (TA:) but<br>\
they changed this saying, (Fr, Sgh, K,) using for<br>\
it a Nabathean expression; (Fr, TA;) saying<br>\
هِطِّى سُمْهَاثًا, i. e. ” red wheat, “(Sgh, K,) accord.<br>\
to Es-Suddee and Mujáhid; or, accord. to IAar,<br>\
حِنْطَةً شُمْقَايَا, i. e. ” good wheat. “ (Sgh, TA.)<br>\
You say also, ↓ سَأَلَهُ الحِطِّيطَى, i. e. الحِطَّةَ [He<br>\
asked of him the putting down of his heavy burden<br>\
from him: or (tropical:)  his sin]. (TA.) And it is said in<br>\
a trad., that when God tries a person with a trial<br>\
in his body, هُوَ لَهُ حِطَّةٌ, i. e. It is to him a mode<br>\
of putting down from him his sins. (TA.)<br>\
الحِطَّةُ is also A name of the month of Ramadán,<br>\
in the Gospel, or some other book: (Az, K, *<br>\
TA:) because it puts down somewhat of the sin<br>\
of him who observes the fast thereof. (Az, TA.)<br>\

respect of rank, or station: (TA:) [or low, or the<br>\

(K, TA,) on the authority of IAar, (TA,) مَرَاكِبُ<br>\
السِّفَلِ, or correctly مَرَاتِبُ السِّفَلِ: (K, TA:) the<br>\
