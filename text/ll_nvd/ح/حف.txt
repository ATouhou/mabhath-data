حَوْلَهُ, (S, K,) or بِهِ, (Msb, and W p. 153, [and<br>\

the saying, (K,) وَلَا رَافٌّ ↓ مَا لَهُ حَافٌّ (S, K) [He<br>\
has not any who goes round about him, and minds,<br>\
or manages, his affairs, &amp;c.]. And ذَهَبَ مَنْ كَانَ<br>\

[i. e. As] says, the حَفَّة is the مِنْوَال; and it should<br>\

numerousness of the eaters thereof; ” or, as some<br>\
say, “food proportionate to the household: ” (TA:)<br>\
or the former signifies a state in which the eaters<br>\
are proportionate to the property; and the latter,<br>\
“ a state in which the eaters are more than proportionate to the property: ” (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, TA:)<br>\
or the former, want; and the latter, “paucity [of<br>\
property]: ” (IAar, TA:) or both signify the<br>\
same. (TA.) One says, مَا رُئِىَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفَفٌ وَلَا<br>\
ضَفَفٌ There was not seen upon them a trace of want.<br>\

is explained by him as meaning [Tell thou Aboo-<br>\
Keys] that he is weak in intellect; as though he<br>\
were the حفيف of the tree called أَثْأَبَة when it is<br>\
agitated by the wind: some say that it means<br>\
