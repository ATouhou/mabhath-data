authority; (K;) He denied him, or refused him,<br>\
the thing; (S, K;) he refused to give him the<br>\
thing: (TA:) he rendered him hopeless of the<br>\
thing: (PS:) accord. to the T, حِرْمٌ signifies the<br>\
act of denying or refusing [a thing]; and حِرْمَةٌ<br>\
is the same as حِرْمَانٌ; (TA;) which signifies<br>\
[also the denying, or refusing, a thing; or] the<br>\
rendering unprosperous, or unfortunate; (KL;)<br>\
[and frequently, as inf. n. of the pass. v. حُرِمَ, the<br>\

K, *) عَلَيْهِ to him; (S;) as also ↓ احرمهُ, (S, *<br>\
Msb, K,) inf. n. إِحْرَامٌ. (S.) The saying اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ<br>\
at the commencement of prayer is termed<br>\
تَكْبِيرَةُ التَّحْرِيمِ [The تكبيرة of prohibition],<br>\
because it prohibits the person praying from saying and doing anything extraneous to prayer:<br>\
and it is also termed ↓ تكبيرةُ الإِحْرَامِ, meaning<br>\
the تكبيرة of entering upon a state of prohibition<br>\
by prayer. (TA.) It is said in a trad., of Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbás, إِذَا حَرَّمَ الرَّجُلُ امْرَأَتَهُ فَهِىَ يَمِينٌ يُكَفِّرُهَا<br>\
[When the man declares his wife to be forbidden<br>\
to him, it is an oath, which he must expiate]:<br>\
for the تَحْرِيم of a wife and of a female slave may<br>\
be without the intention of divorce. (TA.) And<br>\
حَرَّمْتُ الظُّلْمَ عَلَى نَفْسِى, occurring in another<br>\

wrongdoing. (TA.) تَحْرِيمٌ [as the inf. n. of حُرِّمٌ]<br>\

[q. v.] applied to a camel. (TA.) ―<br>\

احرام, [inf. n. إِحْرَامٌ,] He entered upon a<br>\
thing [or state or time] that caused what was<br>\
before allowable, or lawful, to him to be forbidden, or unlawful. (S, * Msb. [See also 5.])<br>\
And hence, (S, Msb,) He purposed entering upon<br>\
the performance of the حَجّ or the عُمْرَة: (Msb:)<br>\
or he (the performer of the حَجّ or the عُمْرَة)<br>\
entered upon acts whereby what was allowable,<br>\
or lawful, to him became forbidden, or unlawful;<br>\
(K, TA;) as venereal intercourse, and the anointing of oneself, and wearing sewed garments, and<br>\
hunting and the like: (TA:) you say, احرام بِالحَجِّ<br>\
and بِالعُمْرَةِ, because what was allowable to the<br>\
person became forbidden; as the killing of objects<br>\
of the chase, and [venereal intercourse with]<br>\
women. (S.) And He entered into the حَرَم,<br>\
i. e. Mekkeh or El-Medeeneh, (K, TA,) or the<br>\
sacred territory of cither of those cities: (TA:)<br>\
or he entered into a sacred, or an inviolable,<br>\
state; or into a state of security or safety, (S,<br>\
K, TA,) being assured by a compact, or bond,<br>\
that he should not be attacked [&amp;c.]: (TA:) or<br>\
it signifies, (K,) or signifies also, (S,) he entered<br>\
upon a sacred month; (S, Msb, K;) and so<br>\
↓ حرّم, (K, TA, [in the CK حَرَمَ,]) inf. n. تَحْرِيمٌ.<br>\
(TA.) And He entered [as a subject] into the<br>\
covenanted state of security of the government of<br>\
the Khaleefeh. (TA.) &#39;Omar said, الصِّيَامُ إِحْرَامٌ<br>\
[Fasting is a state of prohibition], because the<br>\
faster is prohibited from doing that which would<br>\
break his fast. (Sh, TA.) And الرَّجُلُ يُحْرِمُ فِى<br>\
الغَضَبِ, a saying of El-Hasan, means The man<br>\
swears in anger, because he becomes prohibited<br>\
thereby (بِهِ ↓ لِتَحَرُّمِهِ) [from doing, or refraining<br>\
from, a thing]. (TA.) See also 2, second sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  احرام عَنْهُ He refrained from it [as<br>\
though he were prohibited from doing it]. (ElMufaddal, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  احرمهُ: see 2, first sentence.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1.<br>\
-A3-  Also He overcame him in contending for stakes, or wagers, in a game of<br>\
hazard; (AZ, Ks, S, K;) and so ↓ حرّمهُ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. تَحْرِيمٌ. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تحرّم [He became in a state of prohibition]:<br>\
see 4. [Thus it is similar to 4 in the first of the<br>\
senses assigned to this latter above. Like as you<br>\
say, احرم بِالحَجِّ and بِالعُمْرَةِ, so] you say, تحرّم<br>\
بِالصَّلَاةِ [He became in a state of prohibition by<br>\
prayer; i. e.] he pronounced the تَكْبِير [or تَكْبِيرَةُ<br>\
التَّحْرِيمِ, also termed تَكْبِيرَةُ الإِحْرَامِ, (see 2,)] for<br>\
prayer; he entered upon prayer. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Also He protected, or defended, himself.] You<br>\
say, تحرّم مِنْهُ بِحُرْمَةٍ, meaning تمنّع and تحمّى<br>\
[He protected, or defended, himself] بِذِمَّةٍ [by a<br>\
compact, or covenant, whereby he became in a<br>\
state of security or safety, or by a promise, or an<br>\
assurance, of security or safety]; (K;) or بِصُحْبَةٍ<br>\
[by companionship]; or بِحَقٍّ [by a right, or due].<br>\
(TA.) And تحرّم بِصُحْبَتِهِ [He protected, or defended, himself by his companionship: or, as<br>\
explained in the PS, he sought protection, or security, by his companionship]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also [He<br>\
was, or became, entitled to reverence, respect, or<br>\
honour; or] he possessed what entitled him to<br>\
reverence, respect, or honour. (KL.)<br>\
8<br>\
احترمهُ He held him in reverence, respect,<br>\
or honour; he reverenced, respected, or honoured,<br>\
him. (MA.) [See حُرْمَةٌ. Golius and Freytag<br>\
explain اِحْتَرَمَ as meaning “ Dignitate et præsidio<br>\
venerabilis fuit: ” but it is the pass., اُحْتُرِمَ, that<br>\
has this meaning; or rather, he was held in reverence, &amp;c.; was reverenced, &amp;c.]<br>\
10<br>\
استحرم [He deemed himself in a state of<br>\
prohibition]. It is said in a trad., of Adam,<br>\
اِسْتَحْرَمَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِ ابْنِهِ مِائَةَ سَنَةٍ لَمْ يَضْحَكْ [He<br>\
deemed himself in a state of prohibition, after the<br>\
death of his son, a hundred years, not laughing]:<br>\
from أَحْرَمَ signifying “ he entered into a sacred,<br>\
or an inviolable, state. ” (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  استحرمت, said<br>\
of a female cloven-hoofed animal, &amp;c.: see 1.<br>\
حَرْمٌ: see حِرْمٌ.<br>\
حُرْمٌ The state of إِحْرَام (Az, S, K) on account<br>\
of the performance of the حَجّ or the عُمْرَة; (Az,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ حِرْمٌ. (K in art. حل. [See 4 in<br>\
the present art.]) Hence the saying, فَعَلَهُ فِى حُلِّهِ<br>\
وَحُرْمِهِ, and ↓ فِى حِلِّهِ وَ حِرْمِهِ, He did it when he<br>\
was free from احرام and when he was in the state<br>\
of احرام. (K in art. حل.) And hence the saying<br>\
of &#39;Áïsheh, respecting Mohammad, كُنْتُ أُطَيِّبُهُ<br>\
لِحُلِّهِ وَحُرْمِهِ, i. e. [I used to perfume him when he<br>\
was free from احرام and] when he was in the<br>\
state of احرام: (S, Msb: *) or when he became<br>\
free from احرام and when he performed the<br>\
ablution and desired to enter upon the state of<br>\
احرام for the حَجّ or the عُمْرَة. (Az, TA.) [حُرْمُكَ<br>\
in copies of the K, explained as meaning نِسَاؤُكَ<br>\
وَ مَا تَحْمِى, is a mistranscription for حُرَمُكَ: see<br>\
حُرْمَةٌ.]<br>\
حِرْمٌ: see حُرْمٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  See also حَرَامٌ,<br>\
in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  وَ حِرْمٌ عَلَى قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَاهَا أَنَّهُمْ<br>\
لَا يَرْجِعُونَ, (S, * K, * TA,) in the Kur [xxi. 95],<br>\
(TA,) thus read by some, (S, TA,) means وَاجِبٌ<br>\
[i. e. It is a necessary lot of the people of a town<br>\
that we have destroyed that they shall not return]<br>\
(S, K, TA) to their present state of existence:<br>\
(TA:) so explained by Ks, (S, TA,) and by<br>\
I&#39;Ab and Fr and Zj: (TA:) some read ↓ حَرْمٌ:<br>\
(Bd:) the people of El-Medeeneh read ↓ حَرَامٌ;<br>\
meaning forbidden; and accord. to this reading<br>\
and meaning, لا is redundant: (TA:) [or حَرَامٌ<br>\
in this instance is syn. with وَاجِبٌ, like حِرْمٌ;<br>\
for it is said that] the explanation of Ks is confirmed by the saying of &#39;Abd-er-Rahmán Ibn-Jumáneh [in the TA حمانة, app. for جُمَانَة,] ElMuháribee, a Jáhilee,<br>\
لَا أَرَى الدَّهْرَ بَاكِيًا ↓ فَإِنَّ حَرَامًا<br>\
عَلَى شَجْوِهِ إِلَّا بَكِيتُ عَلَى عَمْرٍو<br>\
[For it is a necessary thing that I should not<br>\
ever see one weeping for his sorrow but I should<br>\
weep for &#39;Amr]. (TA.)<br>\
حَرَمٌ: see حَرَامٌ, with which it is sometimes<br>\
syn., like as زَمَنٌ is with زَمَانٌ. (S, Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] الحَرَمُ The حَرَم [or sacred territory]<br>\
of Mekkeh, (Lth, Az, Msb, * K,) upon the limits<br>\
of which were set up ancient boundary-marks<br>\
[said to have been] built by Abraham; (Az, TA;)<br>\
also called حَرَمُ اللّٰهِ and حَرَمُ رَسُوِلِ اللّٰهِ (K) and<br>\
↓ المُحَرَّمُ: (Lth, K:) also the حَرَم of El-Medeeneh: (Msb:) [and Mekkeh itself: and El-Medeeneh itself:] and الحَرَمَانِ [the sacred territory<br>\
of Mekkeh and that of El-Medeeneh: and] Mekkeh [itself] and El-Medeeneh [itself]: pl. أَحْرَامٌ:<br>\
(K:) and حَرَمُ اللّٰهِ is also applied to Mekkeh<br>\
[itself]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also حَرِيمٌ, in two places.<br>\
حَرِمٌ: see حَرَامٌ, with which it is syn. (TA.)<br>\
Zuheyr says,<br>\
وَ إِنْ خَلِيلٌ يَوْمَ مَسْأَلَةٍ<br>\
يَقُولُ لَا غَائِبٌ مَالِى وَ لَا حَرِمُ<br>\
[And if a friend come to him, on a day of solicitation, he says, My cattle are not, or my property is not, absent, nor forbidden, or refused]:<br>\
(S, IB, TA:) [in the S, this is cited as an ex. of<br>\
حَرِمٌ as syn. with حِرْمَانٌ, which is an inf. n. of<br>\
حَرَمَهُ, q. v.: but] IB says that حَرِم means مَمْنُوع:<br>\
(TA:) يقول in this verse is marfooa though commencing an apodosis, because meant to be understood as put before [in the protasis], accord. to<br>\
Sb; as though the poet said, يَقُولُ إِنْ أَتَاهُ خَلِيلٌ:<br>\
accord. to the Koofees, it is so by reason of فَ<br>\
understood. (S, TA.)<br>\
حُرْمَةٌ The state of being forbidden, prohibited,<br>\
or unlawful: (KL:) [and of being sacred, or inviolable; sacredness, or inviolability: (see حَرُمَ,<br>\
of which it is an inf. n.:)] and the state of being<br>\
revered, respected, or honoured. (KL.) See also<br>\
مَحْرَمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (Az, Mgh, Msb, K,) and ↓ حُرُمَةٌ,<br>\
(Mgh, K,) and ↓ حُرَمَةٌ, (K,) Reverence, respect,<br>\
or honour; (Az, K, TK;) a subst. from اِحْتِرَامٌ,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) like فُرْقَةٌ from اِفْتِرَاقٌ; (Msb;) and<br>\
↓ مَحْرَمٌ signifies the same; but properly, a place<br>\
of حُرْمَة: (Mgh:) pl. of the first حُرَمَاتٌ and<br>\
حُرُمَاتٌ and حُرْمَاتٌ, like غرفات pl. of غُرْفَةٌ. (Msb)<br>\
When a man has relationship [to us], and we<br>\
regard him with bashfulness, we say, لَهُ حُرْمَةٌ<br>\
[Reverence, &amp;c., is due to him; or is rendered to<br>\
him]. (Az, TA.) And we say, لِلْمُسْلِمِ عَلَى<br>\
المُسْلِمِ حُرْمَةٌ [Reverence, &amp;c., to the Muslim is<br>\
incumbent on the Muslim]. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
A thing that should be sacred, or inviolable; (S,<br>\
Msb, K;) and so ↓ مَحْرَمَةٌ and ↓ مَحْرُمَةٌ (S, Msb)<br>\
and ↓ مَحْرَمٌ: (Msb:) as, for instance, a man&#39;s<br>\
honour, or reputation: (TK:) a thing which one<br>\
is under an obligation to reverence, respect, or<br>\
honour [and defend]: (Jel in ii. 190:) a thing<br>\
of which one is under an obligation to be mindful,<br>\
observant, or regardful: (Bd ibid.:) [everything<br>\
that is entitled to reverence, respect, honour, or<br>\
defence, in the character and appertenances of a<br>\
person: a thing that one is bound to do, or from<br>\
which one is bound to refrain, from a motive of<br>\
reverence, respect, or honour: (see the next sentence:) and any attribute that renders the subject<br>\
thereof entitled to reverence, respect, or honour:]<br>\
the pl. of حُرْمَةٌ is حُرُمَاتٌ (Bd and Jel ubi suprà,<br>\
and TA) [and حُرَمَاتٌ and حُرْمَاتٌ, as above,]<br>\
and حُرَمٌ; (Msb;) and that of ↓ مَحْرَمٌ [and<br>\
↓ مَحْرَمَةٌ and ↓ مَحْرُمَةٌ] is مَحَارِمُ; (Msb;) and<br>\
مَحْرَمَاتٌ and مَحْرُمَاتٌ [also] are pls. of ↓ مَحْرَمَةٌ<br>\
and ↓ مَحْرُمَةٌ. (As, S.) حُرُمَاتُ اللّٰهِ means [The<br>\
inviolable ordinances and prohibitions of God:<br>\
or] the ordinances of God, and other inviolable<br>\
things: (Bd and Jel * in xxii. 31:) or what it is<br>\
incumbent on one to perform, and unlawful to<br>\
neglect: (Zj, K:) or all the requisitions of God<br>\
relating to the rites and ceremonies of the pilgrimage and to other things: (Ksh in xxii. 31:)<br>\
or the حَرَم [or sacred territory] and the requisitions relating to the pilgrimage: (Bd ubi suprà:)<br>\
or the requisitions relating to the pilgrimage in<br>\
particular: (Ksh ubi suprà:) or the Kaabeh and<br>\
the sacred mosque and the sacred territory and<br>\
the sacred month and the person who is in the<br>\
state of إِحْرَام: (Ksh and Bd ibid.:) or the inviolability (حُرْمَة) of the sacred territory and of<br>\
the state of إِحْرَام and of the sacred month: (TA:)<br>\
or Mekkeh and the pilgrimage and the عُمْرَة,<br>\
and all the acts of disobedience to God which He<br>\
has forbidden: (Mujáhid, TA:) or [simply] the<br>\
acts of disobedience to God. (&#39;Atà, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
[hence, because it should be regarded as sacred,<br>\
or inviolable,] i. q. ذِمَّةٌ [A compact, a covenant,<br>\
or an obligation; and particularly such as renders<br>\
one responsible for the safety, or safe-keeping, of<br>\
a person or thing, or for the restoration of a<br>\
thing, or for the payment of a sum of money, &amp;c.;<br>\
or by which one becomes in a state of security or<br>\
safety: and simply responsibility, or suretiship:<br>\
and security, or safety; security of life and property; protection, or safeguard; a promise, or<br>\
an assurance, of security, safety, protection, or<br>\
safeguard; indemnity; or quarter: or an obligation, a duty, or a right, or due, that should be<br>\

-b5-  And<br>\
[hence also] A man&#39;s حُرَم [i. e. his wives, or<br>\
women under covert,] and his family: (S:) and<br>\
[in like manner the pl.] حُرَمٌ, accord. to the K<br>\
حُرْمٌ, but correctly like زُفَرٌ, (TA,) a man&#39;s wives,<br>\
or women [under covert], (K, TA,) and his household, or family, (TA,) and what he protects, or<br>\
defends; as also مَحَارِمُ, of which the sing. is<br>\
↓ مَحْرُمَةٌ and ↓ مَحْرَمَةٌ: (K, TA:) and hence<br>\
حُرْمَةٌ is applied by the vulgar to signify a wife.<br>\
(TA.) [In Har, p. 377, a man&#39;s حُرْمَة is said to<br>\
mean his حَرَم and his family: and in p. 489, a<br>\
man&#39;s حَرَم is said to mean his family and his<br>\
wives and those whom he protects, or defends.<br>\
See also حَرِيمٌ.] ―<br>\

a female cloven-hoofed animal, (K,) or of a ewe,<br>\
or she-goat, (S,) and of a she-wolf and of a bitch,<br>\
(K,) for the male: (S, K:) حَرَمَةٌ in ewes, or she-goats, is like ضَبَعَةٌ in she-camels, and حِنَآءٌ in<br>\
ewes. (S.) It is also used, in a trad., in relation<br>\
to male human beings. (K.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
respecting those whom the hour [of the resurrection] shall overtake, تُبْعَثُ عَلَيْهِمُ الحِرْمَةُ وَ يُسْلَبُونَ<br>\
الحَيَآءَ, i. e. Venereal desire [shall be made to befall them, and they shall be bereft of shame]. (S.)<br>\
حَرَمَةٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
حُرَمَةٌ: see حُرْمَةٌ.<br>\
حُرُمَةٌ: see حُرْمَةٌ.<br>\
حَرْمَى, applied to a female cloven-hoofed animal, (K,) or to a ewe, or she-goat, (S,) and to a<br>\
she-wolf and to a bitch, (K,) Desiring the male:<br>\
pl. حِرَامٌ and حَرَامَى, (S, K,) like عِجَالٌ and<br>\
عَجَالَى, (S,) or the latter pl. is حُرَامَى; (so accord.<br>\
to some copies of the K [like عُجَالَى];) as though<br>\
its masc., if it had a masc., were حَرْمَانُ. (S.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
حَرْمَى وَ اللّٰهِ means the same as أَمَا وَ اللّٰهِ [Verily, or<br>\
now surely, by God]; (K;) as also حَزْمَى وَ اللّٰهِ.<br>\
(K in art. حزم.)<br>\
حِرْمِىٌّ, applied to a man, Of, or belonging to,<br>\
the حَرَم: fem. حِرْمِيَّةٌ. (S, Msb, TA.) [In the<br>\
TA it is said that Mbr mentions two forms of the<br>\
epithet حرميّة as applied to a woman: it does not<br>\
specify what these are; but one seems to be حُرْمِيَّةٌ,<br>\
for he says that it is from the phrase وَ حُرْمَةِ البَيْتِ<br>\
“ by the sacredness of the House ” of God.] Az<br>\
says, on the authority of Lth, that when they applied the rel. n. from الحَرَمُ to anything not a<br>\
human being, [as, for instance, to a garment, or<br>\
piece of cloth,] they said ↓ ثَوْبٌ حَرَمِىٌّ: (Msb:)<br>\

a pilgrim who ate the food of a man of the حَرَم,<br>\
and performed his circuiting round the Kaábeh<br>\
in this man&#39;s clothes: each of these was called the<br>\
حِرْمِىّ of the other: every one of the chiefs of the<br>\
Arabs who imposed upon himself hardship, or<br>\
strictness, in his religious practices had a حرمىّ<br>\
of the tribe of Kureysh; and when he performed<br>\
the pilgrimage, would not eat any food but that<br>\
of this man, nor perform his circuiting round the<br>\
Kaabeh except in this man&#39;s clothes. (TA.)<br>\

أَفْعَلُ, or يَمِينُ اللّٰه لا افعل: (S, K:) it may mean<br>\
a declaration that the wife or the female slave<br>\
shall be forbidden [to him who utters it], without<br>\
the intention of divorcing [thereby the former, or<br>\
of emancipating the latter; so that it may be rendered, according to the two different readings, I<br>\
imprecate upon myself, or that which I imprecate<br>\
upon myself is, what is forbidden of God, if I do<br>\
it: I will not do such a thing: in like manner,<br>\
