حَشَرَ, aor.<br>\
حَشُرَ and<br>\
حَشِرَ, (S, Msb, K,) the former<br>\
of which aors. is found in the seven readings of<br>\
the Kur, (Msb,) inf. n. حَشْرٌ, (S, Msb, K,) He<br>\
congregated, or collected together, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
men: (S, Msb:) or he congregated them, or collected them together, and drove them: (Msb,<br>\
TA:) he made them to go forth, collected together,<br>\
from one place to another: (Bd in lix. 2:) he,<br>\
or it, compelled them to emigrate: (K, * TA: [in<br>\
the CK الخَلَآءُ is put by mistake for الجَلَاءُ, the<br>\
explanation of the inf. n.:]) and [simply] he drove<br>\
towards a place or quarter. (TA.) Hence يَوْمُ<br>\
الحَشْرِ (tropical:)  [The day of congregation, &amp;c.; meaning]<br>\
the day of resurrection: (S, * TA:) [see also<br>\
مَحْشِرٌ:] and سُورَةُ الحَشْرِ (tropical:)  [The Chapter of the<br>\
Compulsion to emigration; which is the fifty-ninth<br>\
chapter of the Kur-an]. (TA.) It is said by most of<br>\
the expositors of the Kur that the wild animals and<br>\
other beasts, and even the flies, will be collected together (تُحْشَرُ) for retaliation; and they cite a trad.<br>\
on this subject. (TA.) So in the Kur [lxxxi. 5],<br>\
وَ إِذَا الوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ And when the wild animals<br>\
shall be collected together, (Bd, Jel,) from every<br>\
quarter, (Bd,) after resurrection; (Jel;) or raised<br>\
to life, (Bd,) for the purpose of their retaliating,<br>\
one upon another; after which they shall return<br>\
to dust: (Bd, Jel:) or the meaning is, shall die,<br>\
(Az, S,) in the present world; accord. to some:<br>\
(Az:) and thus says &#39;Ikrimeh, (S, TA,) on the<br>\
authority of I&#39;Ab, (TA,) as is related by Sa&#39;eed<br>\
Ibn-Masrook: (S, TA:) but accord. to some, the<br>\
two meanings are nearly the same; for each denotes collection. (TA.) حَشْرٌ also signifies The<br>\
going forth with a people fleeing or hastening or<br>\
dispersing themselves in war; when used absolutely. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  حَشَرَتْهُمُ السَّنَةُ, aor.<br>\
حَشُرَ and<br>\
حَشِرَ<br>\
(Lth,) inf. n. حَشْرٌ, (K,) (tropical:)  The year of dearth destroyed their camels and other quadrupeds; because it causes the owners to collect themselves<br>\
from the various quarters to the cities or towns:<br>\
(Lth:) or it caused them to go down to the cities<br>\
or towns: (A:) or it distressed them; app., because of their collecting themselves together from<br>\
the desert to the places of settled abodes: (Abu-t-<br>\
Teiyib:) and حَشَرَتِ السَّنَةُ مَالَ فُلَانٍ The year of<br>\
dearth destroyed the camels &amp;c. of such a one.<br>\
(S, K. *)<br>\
-A2-  حَشَرَهُ, (S, A,) inf. n. حَشْرٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
(tropical:) He made it (a spear-head, S, A) thin, or slender:<br>\
(S, A, K:) he made it (a spear-head, and a knife,)<br>\
sharp, or pointed, and thin, or slender: (TA:)<br>\
he made it small, and thin, or slender: (Th:) he<br>\
pared it; namely, a stick: (TA:) he pared it,<br>\
and made it sharp, or pointed. (S.)<br>\
7<br>\
انحشروا They (people) became collected together from the desert to the places of settled<br>\
abodes. (Abu-t-Teiyib.)<br>\
حَشْرٌ (tropical:)  Anything thin, or slender, or elegant.<br>\
(TA.) You say أُذُنُ حَشْرٌ (tropical:) A thin, or an elegant,<br>\
ear; (Lth, ISk, S, A, K;) as though it were<br>\
pared, (Lth, S,) and made sharp: (S:) or small,<br>\
elegant, and round: (Lth:) or thin at the end:<br>\
(Th:) or sharp-pointed: (TA:) and the epithet<br>\
is the same for the dual also and the pl.: (K:)<br>\
[J says that] it does not admit the dual form nor<br>\
the pl., because it is originally an inf. n., and the<br>\
expression above mentioned is like مَآءٌ غَوْرٌ and<br>\
مَآءٌ سَكْبٌ: but اذن حَشْرَةٌ is sometimes said: (S:)<br>\
and the pl. حُشُورٌ occurs in a verse of Umeiyeh<br>\
Ibn-Abee-&#39;Áïdh: (TA:) and you also say اذن<br>\
↓ مَحْشُورَةٌ. (TA.) حَشْرٌ is also applied in the same<br>\
sense as an epithet to other things. (S) You say<br>\
قُذَّةٌ حَشْرٌ (tropical:)  A thin, or an elegant, feather of an<br>\
arrow; (Lth, S, A, K;) as though it were pared:<br>\
(Lth:) or sharp-pointed. (TA.) Also سِنَانٌ حَشْرٌ<br>\
(tropical:)  A thin, or slender, spear-head: (S, K:) or sharp,<br>\
or sharp-pointed: and سِكِّينٌ حَشْرٌ in like manner: and حَرْبَةٌ حَشْرَةٌ: (TA:) and سَهْمٌ حَشْرٌ, and<br>\
سِهَامٌ حُشْرٌ: like جَوْنٌ and جُونٌ, and وَرْدٌ and وُرْدٌ:<br>\
(Akh, S:) or سَهْمٌ حَشْرٌ signifies an arrow having<br>\
straight, or even, feathers; and so ↓ سهم مَحْشُورٌ;<br>\
and ↓ حَشِرٌ, of the same measure as كَتِفٌ, an arrow having good feathers attached to it. (TA.)<br>\
You also say بَعِيرٌ حَشْرُ الأُذُنِ (tropical:)  A camel having a<br>\
thin, or an elegant, ear. (TA.)<br>\
حَشِرٌ: see حَشْرٌ.<br>\
حَشَرَةٌ and حَشَرَاتٌ, (K,) each being a coll. n.<br>\
without a sing.; (TA;) or the former is sing. of<br>\
the latter; (S, Msb;) Any small animals that<br>\
creep or walk upon the earth; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;)<br>\
as jerboas and hedgehogs and lizards of the kind<br>\
called ضَبّ and the like: (TA:) or the former,<br>\
(Msb,) or latter, (Mgh,) is applied to rats or mice,<br>\
and jerboas, and lizards of the kind above mentioned, (Mgh, Msb,) colleted together: (Msb:)<br>\
or any venomous or noxious reptiles or the like,<br>\
such as scorpions and serpents; syn. هَوَامُّ; (As,<br>\

-b2-  Also<br>\

the like, birds, and fish, &amp;c.; (K;) whether small<br>\
or great: (TA:) or the great thereof: or what<br>\
is eaten thereof: (K:) thus in all the copies of<br>\
the K; but the pronoun [in the latter case] does<br>\
not refer to the animals &amp;c. above mentioned: it<br>\
is expressly said in the T and M that the word<br>\
signifies whatever is eaten of herbs, or leguminous<br>\
plants, of the earth, such as the دُعَاع and فَثّ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
حَاشِرٌ One who congregates, or collects together,<br>\
people. (TA.) With the article ال, applied to<br>\
Mohammad; (S, K;) because he collects people<br>\
after him (S, IAth) and to his religion. (IAth.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  A collector of spoils: (El-Hulwánee, Mgh:)<br>\

meaning the day of judgment]. (TA.)<br>\
مَحْشُورٌ; and its fem., with ة: see حَشْرٌ.<br>\
