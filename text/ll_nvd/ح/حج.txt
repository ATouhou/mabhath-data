absolute sense: or to, or towards, an object of<br>\
reverence, veneration, respect, or honour: or,<br>\

ceremonies of the pilgrimage; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;)<br>\
or for the purpose of the عُمْرَة [q. v.; but this<br>\
latter meaning is very rare: the usual meaning<br>\
is, he performed the pilgrimage to Mekkeh and<br>\
Mount&#39; Arafát, with all the rites and ceremonies<br>\
prescribed to be observed at, and between, those<br>\
two places]: (Msb:) or he repaired to the House<br>\

to visit the House of God, (Aboo-Tálib, Az,) or<br>\
for the performance of the rites and ceremonies<br>\
of the pilgrimage, (Msb,) but he journeyed for<br>\
mercantile purposes. (Aboo-Tálib, Az, Msb. [See<br>\
also art. دج.]) And hence, accord. to some,<br>\

with a little cotton: (TA:) or حَجَّهُ, inf. n. حَجٌّ,<br>\
signifies he probed a fracture of his head for the<br>\
purpose of curing it: (S:) or he made a perforation in the bone [of his broken head] (قَدَحَ فِيهِ)<br>\
with an iron instrument, it being broken so that<br>\
the brain was befouled with blood, and pulled off<br>\
the skin that had dried up, and then cured it,<br>\

8<br>\
إِحْتَجَ3َ see 1.<br>\
-A2-  [احتجّ بِشَىْءٍ He adduced, or<br>\

R. Q. 1<br>\
حَجْحَجَ, inf. n. حَجْحَجَةٌ: see 1, last<br>\
signification. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He retired, or drew back;<br>\
or did so in fear: (S, K:) or he lacked power,<br>\

حَمْلَةً ثُمَّ حَجْحَجُوا They made a single charge,<br>\

drew back; or drew back in fear: (S, TA:) or<br>\
lacked power, or ability. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He refrained<br>\
from saying what he desired, or was about, to<br>\
say; (S, K;) like مَجْمَجَ: (S:) or he did not<br>\
reveal, or manifest, what was in his mind. (M,<br>\
TA.) It is said in one of the provs. of Meyd,<br>\
نَفْسُكَ بِمَا تُحَجْحِجُ أَعْلَمُ Thou thyself knowest<br>\
better than others [what thou refrainest from<br>\
uttering, or] what is in thy mind. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He<br>\
remained, stayed, abode, or dwelt, (K, TA,) بِمَكَانٍ<br>\
in a place; not quitting it; as also ↓ تَحَجْحَجَ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَحَجْحَجَ: see what next precedes.<br>\
حَجُّ and ↓ حِجٌّ, the former an inf. n., and the<br>\
latter a simple subst., (S, Msb, K,) or the latter<br>\
also is an inf. n., (Sb, L,) [both used as substs.,]<br>\
The pilgrimage to Mekkeh, (S, K,) or to the<br>\
Kaabeh, (Msb,) to perform the religious rites<br>\
and ceremonies prescribed to be observed on that<br>\
occasion: (S, Msb, K:) Ks makes no difference<br>\
between these two words: some say that the<br>\
former is employed to signify the religious rites<br>\
and ceremonies of the pilgrimage because they<br>\
follow the repairing to Mekkeh, or because<br>\
they are completed by shaving [the head], or<br>\
because people continue long going to and fro<br>\
to perform them: accord. to Az, it signifies the<br>\
performance of the religious rites and ceremonies<br>\
of the pilgrimage of one year; and some<br>\
say ↓ حِجٌّ and ↓ حِجَّةٌ: (TA:) or this last signifies a single pilgrimage, for the performance<br>\
of its appointed religious rites and ceremonies;<br>\
deviating from rule; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) for by<br>\
rule it should be ↓ حَجَّةٌ, (S, Mgh, K,) which, Th<br>\
says, has not been heard from the Arabs: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) Ks says that ↓ حَجَجْتُ حِجَّةً and رَأَيْتُ<br>\
رُؤْيَةً are the only deviations from the model of<br>\
فَعَلْتُ فَعْلَةً in all the language of the Arabs: but<br>\
El-Athram and others are related to have said,<br>\
We have not heard from the Arabs حَجَجْتُ حِجَّةً<br>\
nor رَأَيْتُ رِئْيَةً; they saying only ↓ حَجَجْتُ حَجَّةً:<br>\
(L, TA:) whence it appears that ↓ حَجَّةٌ and<br>\
↓ حِجَّةٌ were both used: (TA:) the pl. of the<br>\
latter is حِجَجٌ: (Mgh, Msb:) so in the saying,<br>\
نَذَرَ خَمْسَ حِجَجٍ [He made a vow to perform<br>\
five pilgrimages]. (Mgh.) Hence, ↓ ذُو الحِجَّةِ<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb) and ↓ ذو الحَجَّةِ, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
which latter is said by Kz and &#39;Iyád and Ibn-<br>\
Kurkool to be the more common, (TA,) [or,<br>\
accord. to Fei, the contr. is the case, for he says,]<br>\
some pronounce it in the latter manner, (Msb,)<br>\
[The last month of the Arabian calendar;] the<br>\
month of the pilgrimage; (S, Mgh, Msb;) so<br>\
called because the pilgrimage to Mekkeh, and<br>\
the religious rites and ceremonies thereof, are<br>\
performed in it: (TA:) pl. ذَوَاتُ الحجّهِ: (S,<br>\
Msb:) they did not say ذَوُو الحَجّةِ agreeably<br>\
with the singular. (S.) [Hence also,] ↓ وَحَجَّةِ<br>\
اللّٰهِ لَا أَفْعَلُ [By the pilgrimage which is the<br>\
ordinance of God, I will not do this or that<br>\
thing]: a form of oath used by the Arabs. (S,<br>\
K.) What is commonly termed الحَجُّ is sometimes termed الحَجُّ الأَكْبَرُ [The greater pilgrimage]: العُمْرَةُ [q. v.] being termed الحَجَّ<br>\
الأَصْغَرُ [the minor pilgrimage]. (Kull p. 168.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also حَاجٌّ.<br>\
حِجُّ: see حَجُّ, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also<br>\
حَاجٌّ.<br>\
حَجَّةٌ: see حَجٌّ, in five places.<br>\
-A2-  Also, (IAar,<br>\
K,) and ↓ حِجَّةٌ, (S, K,) the former of which is<br>\
the word commonly known, (IAar in a marginal<br>\
note in a copy of the S,) and ↓ حَاجَّةٌ, which is a<br>\
subst. like كَاهِلٌ and غَارِبٌ, (L,) The lobe of the<br>\
ear. (S, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And the first, The bore, or<br>\
perforation, of the lobe of the ear. (AA, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And A bead, or a pearl, that is hung in the<br>\
ear; (K;) sometimes called ↓ حَاجَّةٌ. (IDrd,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
حُجَّةٌ A mode [of argument or the like] by<br>\
which one overcomes in a litigation, dispute, or<br>\
altercation; so called because recourse is had to<br>\
it (لِأَنَّهَا تُحَجُّ, i. e. تُقْصَدُ): (T, TA:) that by<br>\
which one rebuts, or refels, an adversary in a<br>\
litigation, dispute, or altercation: an argument;<br>\
a plea; an allegation: [it may be true or false:<br>\
see Kur xlii. 15, and xlv. 24:] (TA:) a proof;<br>\
an evidence; a testimony: (S, Msb, K:) [a title;<br>\
a voucher: often thus used in the present day:]<br>\
also applied to a person; like ثَبَتٌ; (A and Mgh<br>\
and TA in art. ثبت;) [as in the saying, مَنْ حِفِظَ<br>\
حُجَّةٌ عَلَى مَنْ لَمْ يَحْفَظْ He who preserves in his<br>\
mind a word, or an authority, &amp;c., is an evidence<br>\
against him who does not; occurring often in the<br>\
larger lexicons, expressing the superior authority<br>\
of hearsay, or usage, over analogy &amp;c.; and in<br>\
the saying,] أَنْتَ حُجَّةٌ عَلَى نَفْسِكَ [Thou art an<br>\
evidence against thyself]; a phrase mentioned by<br>\
Akh: (S in art. بصر:) [also, an excuse:] pl.<br>\
حُجَجٌ (A, Msb) and حِجَاجٌ. (TA.)<br>\
حِجَّةٌ: see حَجٌّ, in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A<br>\
year: (S, Msb, K:) pl. حِجَجٌ. (S, A, Msb.)<br>\
You say, أَقَمْتُ عِنْدَهُ حِجَّةً [I stayed at his abode<br>\
a year], and ثَلَاثَ حِجَجٍ كَوَامِلَ [three complete<br>\
years]. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  See also حَجَّةٌ.<br>\
حُجُجٌ: see حَجِيجٌ, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see<br>\
also حَجَاجٌ.<br>\
حَجَاجٌ and ↓ حِجَاجٌ The surrounding bone of<br>\
the eye, (Msb, TA,) upon [the upper part of]<br>\
which grows the eyebrow; (TA;) the bone that<br>\
surrounds the cavity of the eye, upon [the upper<br>\
part of] which grows the hair of the eyebrow:<br>\
(ISk, TA:) it is said in a trad. that a female<br>\
hyena and her young ones were within the<br>\
حجاج of the eye of an Amalekite: (TA:) or<br>\
the [supra-orbital] bone upon which grows the hair<br>\
of the eyebrow; (S, K;) the bone that projects<br>\
over the cavity of the eye: (IAmb, Msb:) or the<br>\
upper bone, beneath the eyebrow: (TA:) of the<br>\
mase. gender: (Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَحِجَّةٌ (S,<br>\
Msb) and [of mult.] ↓ حُجُجٌ, deviating from a<br>\
general rule, accord. to which a sing. of the<br>\
measure to which this belongs does not assume<br>\
this form of pl. because the reduplication is disapproved: also, by poetic license, حَوَاجِجُ, contr.<br>\
to rule, for حَوَاجُّ. (TA.) The expression فِى<br>\
حَجَا حَاجِبٍ ضَمْرٍ is used by poetic license for<br>\
فى حَجَاجِ حاجب ضمر. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
both words also signify (tropical:)  The upper limb of the<br>\
disk (i. q. حَاجِب) of the sun, appearing when it<br>\
begins to rise. (A, K, TA: but in the A, only<br>\
the latter form of the word is given.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also,<br>\
[hence,] both words, (tropical:)  A side. (A, * K.) You<br>\
say, مَرُّوا بِحِجَاجَىِ الجَبَلِ (tropical:)  They passed by the<br>\
two sides of the mountain. (A.)<br>\
حِجَاجٌ: see the paragraph next preceding.<br>\
حَجِيجٌ A man upon whom the operation termed<br>\
حَجٌّ (the probing of a fracture of the head, &amp;c.,)<br>\
has been performed; (S, L;) as also ↓ مَحْجُوجٌ.<br>\
(L.) And A fracture of the head that has been<br>\
medically treated, or cured: ―<br>\
-b2-  and also A certain<br>\
mode of medical treatment, or curing, of such a<br>\
fracture. (As, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ↓ حُجُجٌ (pl. of حَجِيجٌ,<br>\
TA) signifies Probed wounds. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
↓ this same pl., Roads much furrowed [by the<br>\
feet of beasts or men] (مُحَفَّرَةٌ): (L, K:) but it is<br>\
uncertain whether its sing., if it have any, be<br>\
حَجِيجٌ or حِجَاجٌ. (MF.)<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. ↓ مُحَاجٌّ<br>\
as act. part. n. of حَاجَّ: so in the phrase, أَنَا<br>\
حَجِيجُهُ I am he who will overcome him by<br>\
arguments, or proofs, or the like: occurring in a<br>\
trad. relating to Ed-Dejjál. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also<br>\
حَاجٌّ.<br>\
حَجَّاجٌ A frequent performer of the pilgrimage<br>\
to Mekkeh, and of the religious rites and ceremonies ordained for that occasion: the ا in this<br>\
word, as in other epithets of the same measure,<br>\
does not [regularly] admit of imáleh; but when<br>\
it is used as a proper name, it admits this, agreeably with rule: some pronounce its ا with imáleh<br>\
even when it is in the nom. or accus. case,<br>\
contr. to rule. (TA.)<br>\
حَاجٌّ act. part. n. of 1; Repairing, or betaking<br>\
himself, to [a person or place]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
hence, (S, Msb,) A man repairing to Mekkeh,<br>\
(S, K,) or to the Kaabeh, (Msb,) to perform the<br>\
religious rites and ceremonies of the pilgrimage;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) or for the purpose of the عُمْرَة:<br>\
(Msb: [but see 1:]) [a pilgrim of Mekkeh; or<br>\
one who has performed the pilgrimage of Mekkeh:<br>\
see what follows:] as also ↓ حَاجِجٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
the original form, sometimes used by poetic<br>\
license: (S:) pl. حُجَّاجٌ and ↓ حَجِيجٌ (S, A,<br>\
Msb, K) and حُجٌّ; (S, K;) or rather the second<br>\
of these is a quasi-pl. n., a kind of noun which,<br>\
as well as the coll. gen. n., is often called by the<br>\
lexicographers a pl., though not so called by the<br>\
grammarians: (MF:) حَاجٌّ is also used as a pl.,<br>\
syn. with حُجَّاجٌ, like as سَامِرٌ is with سُمَّارٌ:<br>\
(Mgh:) it may be considered as a gen. n., and is<br>\
sometimes a quasi-pl. n., like جَامِلٌ and بَاقِرٌ;<br>\
(TA;) as is also ↓ حِجٌّ; signifying a company of<br>\
pilgrims of Mekkeh; or pilgrims, collectively;<br>\
(ISk, L;) and likewise ↓ حَجٌّ. (So in a marginal<br>\
note in a copy of the S.) The fem. is ↓ حَاجَّةٌ:<br>\
pl. حَوَاجُّ: (S, K:) you say حَوَاجُّ بَيْتِ اللّٰهِ when<br>\
they have performed the pilgrimage; but when<br>\
they have not yet performed it, [being in the act<br>\
of performing it,] you say حَوَاجُّ بَيْتَ اللّٰهِ, in<br>\
which latter case you would say حَوَاجٌّ were not<br>\
this word imperfectly decl.; [and in like manner,<br>\
حَاجُّ بَيْتِ اللّٰهِ, and حَاجٌّ بَيْتَ اللّٰهِ;] like as you<br>\
say ضَارِبُ زَيْدٍ أَمْسِ, and ضَارِبٌ زَيْدًا غَدًا. (S.)<br>\
[↓ حَاجِّىٌّ, as a n. un. of حَاجٌّ, considering the latter<br>\
as a coll. gen. n., like رُومٌ, of which the n. un. is<br>\
رُومِىٌّ is commonly used by the Turks and Persians as signifying a pilgrim of Mekkeh: but I<br>\
have not found it so used in any classical Arabic<br>\
work.] You say, أَقْبَلَ الحَاجُّ وَالدَّاجُّ The company<br>\
of pilgrims to Mekkeh, and of men travelling for<br>\
mercantile purposes, came. (TA. [See also art.<br>\
دج.]) And وَلَا دَاجَّةً ↓ لَمْ يَتْرُكْ He left not<br>\
a company of pilgrims to Mekkeh (جَمَاعَةً حَاجَّةً),<br>\
nor a company of their followers, or dependents.<br>\
(TA from a trad. [See also arts. دج and دوج.])<br>\
-A2-  Also Overcoming in [or by] an argument, or<br>\
a plea, or the like. (Mgh.)<br>\

-A2-  and see also<br>\
حَجَّةٌ, in two places.<br>\
حَاجِجٌ: see حَاجٌّ.<br>\
حَاجِّىٌّ: see حَاجٌّ.<br>\
هُوَ أَحَجُّ مِنْهُ He is one who overcomes in [or<br>\
by] a حُجَّة [i. e. an argument, &amp;c.,] more than<br>\
he. (Mgh.)<br>\
مَحَجَّةٌ A road, or way: (Mgh, TA:) or the<br>\
middle of a road; (M, voce جَرَجَةٌ;) the beaten<br>\
track, or part of a road along which one travels;<br>\
(T, TA;) the main part, and middle, of a road;<br>\
syn. جَادَّةٌ: (S, Msb:) pl. مَحَاجُّ. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] اِجْعَلِ الأَمْرَ مَحَجَّةً وَاحِدَةً (assumed tropical:)  Make thou<br>\
the affair, or case, [uniform, or] one uniform<br>\
thing. (Fr, TA in art. بأج.)<br>\
