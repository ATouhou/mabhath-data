حَابَ, (Msb, K,) sec. pers. حُبْتُ, (S,) aor.<br>\
يَحُوبُ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. حَوْبٌ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
حَوْبَةٌ and حِيَابَةٌ, (S, K, accord. to one copy of<br>\
the K حِيَابٌ,) and حِيبَةٌ (TA) and حُوبٌ; (K;)<br>\
or this last is a simple subst.; or, as some say, it<br>\
and حَوْبٌ are two dial. vars.; that with damm,<br>\
of the dial. of El-Hijáz; and that with fet-h,<br>\
of the dial. of Temeem; (Msb;) accord. to Zj,<br>\
that with damm signifies “ sin, or crime; ” and<br>\
that with fet-h, the “ act ” of a man; [i. e. the<br>\
“ act of committing a sin, or crime; ”] (TA;)<br>\
He sinned; committed a sin, or crime; did what<br>\
was unlawful; (S, Msb, K;) بِكَذَا [by such a<br>\
thing]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, aor. as above, [inf. n.<br>\
not mentioned,] He, or it, became in an evil condition, or state. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He slew [another]:<br>\
of the dial. of the tribe of Asad. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  حَوْبٌ<br>\
also signifies The act of chiding a male camel<br>\

He chid the camels (S, K) by the cry حَوْبِ حَوْبِ.<br>\
(S.) [See also 1.]<br>\

أَحْوَبَ He pursued a course that led him to<br>\
sin, or crime. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  مَا أَحَبْتُهُ for مَا أَحْبَبْتُهُ:<br>\
see 4 in art. حب.<br>\
5<br>\
تحوّب He abstained from, shunned, or<br>\
avoided, sin, or crime; put it away from himself:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, S, K, TA:) he applied himself to acts,<br>\
or exercises, of devotion; became devout, or a<br>\
devotee. (IJ, TA.) Here the form تَفَعَّلَ is deprived of the radical signification, as in the cases<br>\
of the syn. words تَأَثَّمَ and تَحَنَّثَ; though its<br>\
property is oftener to confirm the radical signification. (TA. [See تحنّث.]) You say, تحوّب<br>\
مِنْ كَذَا He abstained from such a thing as a<br>\
sin, or crime. (A &#39;Obeyd, S, TA. [See also<br>\
another explanation below.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  He humbled himself in his prayer, or supplication. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He<br>\
expressed pain, grief, or sorrow; lamented, or<br>\
complained. (S, K, * TA.) And تحوّب مِنْ كَذَا<br>\

sorrow, or lamented, or complained, by reason of<br>\
such a thing. (TA. [See another explanation<br>\
above.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  He cried out, expressing pain or<br>\
grief or sorrow, or lamenting, or complaining:<br>\
he cried aloud, or vehemently, in prayer, or supplication. (TA.) He wept, in impatience, or<br>\
sorrow, and with loud crying: and sometimes,<br>\
in a general sense, he cried out, or aloud, (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  He (a jackal) cried, or howled: because his<br>\
cry is like that of a person expressing pain or<br>\
grief or sorrow, or lamenting, or complaining,<br>\
as though he were writhing from the pain of<br>\
hunger or beating. (S, TA.)<br>\
حَبْ and حَبٍ: see حَوْبٍ, in five places.<br>\
حَابْ and حَابِ: see حَوْبِ, in five places.<br>\
حَابٌ: see حُوبٌ.<br>\
حَوْبِ and حَوْبُ and حَوْبَ (S, K) and ↓ حَابِ<br>\
(K) A cry used for chiding a camel: (S:) or<br>\
a cry by which a male camel is chidden, (Lth,<br>\
IAth, K,) to urge him on; (Lth, TA;) like as<br>\
a she-camel is by the cry حَلْ and حَلِ and حَلِى:<br>\
the first form (حَوْبِ) is that used by the Arabs<br>\
[in general]; but the other forms are allowable:<br>\
حَوْبْ حَوْبْ also occurs, with the ب quiescent;<br>\
and حَوْبًا حَوْبًا occurs in a trad., in the same sense:<br>\
also, لَا مَشَيْتُ ↓ حَبْ and ↓ حَبِ and ↓ حَابْ and<br>\
↓ حَابِ [On! mayest thou not walk, or mayest<br>\
thou not be rightly directed; حب &amp;c. being syn.<br>\
with حَوْبِ, and followed by an imprecation].<br>\
(TA.) Hence, حَوْبَكَ هَلْ يُعْتَمُ بِالسَّمَارِ Urge on!<br>\
Should a delay be made in bringing milk much<br>\
diluted with water? i. e., if thou entertain with<br>\
milk much diluted with water, wherefore tardiness? a prov., applied to him who delays the<br>\
fulfilment of his promise, and then gives little.<br>\
(MF.)<br>\
حَوْبٌ: see حُوبٌ, in two places:<br>\
-A2-  and see<br>\
also حَوْبَةٌ, in four places. ―<br>\

-A5-  A he-camel: (K:) or a bulky he-camel: so<br>\
called from the cry حَوْبِ, by which he is urged;<br>\
like as a mule is called عَدَسٌ: (Lth, TA:) or it<br>\
signifies originally a he-camel, and hence, from<br>\
its frequency of usage, the cry حوب by which he<br>\
is urged. (K, * TA.)<br>\
حُوبٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ حَوْبٌ, (Msb, * K,)<br>\

single sin or crime: (Msb, TA:) accord. to Fr,<br>\
حُوبٌ signifies great sin, or a great sin: accord.<br>\
to Katádeh, wrong, injustice, or tyranny: thus in<br>\
the Kur iv. 2; where El-Hasan read ↓ حَوْبًا instead of حُوبًا. (TA.) One says, رَبِّ تَقَبَّلْ تَوْبَتِى<br>\
↓ وَاغْسِلْ حَوْبَتِى (T, TA) i. e. [O my Lord, accept<br>\
my repentance, and wash away] my sin, or crime.<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, TA.) El-Mukhabbal Es-Saadee says,<br>\
↓ فَلَا تُدْخِلَنَّ الدَّهْرَ قَبْرَكَ حَوْبَةً<br>\
يَقُومُ بِهَا يَوْمًا عَلَيْكِ حَسِيبُ<br>\
[Then introduce not thou, ever, into thy grave,<br>\
a sin with which a reckoner, or taker of vengeance, may one day rise up against thee]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  حُوبٌ also signifies Perdition, destruction, or<br>\
death. (K.) [Hence, app.,] اِبْنَةُ حوبٍ A quiver;<br>\

indicated.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Disease. (K.) ―<br>\

trad.) And أَلْحَقَ اللّٰهُ بِهِ الحَوْبَةَ May God bring<br>\
