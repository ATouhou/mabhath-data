حَتَمَهُ, aor.<br>\
حَتِمَ, (K,) inf. n. حَتْمٌ, (S, TA,) He<br>\
made it, or rendered it, firm; or established it, or<br>\
settled it, firmly; namely, a thing, or an affair.<br>\
(S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He decreed it; ordained it; pronounced it; or decided it judicially: (TA:) and<br>\
so حَتَمَ بِهِ. (TK.) [See حَاتِمٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  He necessitated<br>\
it; or made it, or rendered it, necessary, requisite,<br>\
or unavoidable; syn. أَوْجَبَهُ: (S, K, * TA:) and so<br>\
حَتَمَ بِهِ. (Msb.) See حَاتِمٌ. You say, حَتَمْتُ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ I made it, or rendered it, necessary,<br>\
&amp;c., for him to do, or to suffer, the thing. (S.<br>\
[Golius, reading أَوْحَيْتُ for أَوْجَبْتُ, the explanation in the S, has rendered حَتَمَ as signifying<br>\
“ inspiravit: ” and the next explanation given by<br>\
him, i. e. “ indicavit,” is a misprint for “ judicavit. ”]) Or حَتَمَ عَلَيْهِ الأَمْرَ, aor. and inf. n. as<br>\
above, signifies He made the thing, or affair, or<br>\
event, to be absolutely, or decisively, or irreversibly,<br>\
necessary, requisite, or unavoidable, for him to do,<br>\
or to suffer. (Msb.) حُتُومٌ, which is pl. of حَتْمٌ,<br>\
may also be an inf. n. of حَتَمَ, and is likewise pl. of<br>\
حَاتِمٌ. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تحتّم He made a thing to be necessary, or<br>\
unavoidable. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, perhaps,]<br>\
تحتّم لِفُلَانٍ بِخَيْرٍ He wished such a one good:<br>\
or he augured good for him. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 7.<br>\

[It (a thing that was eaten) was soft, yielding,<br>\
crummy, or easily broken.] It is said in the S<br>\
that التَّحَتُّمُ signifies الهَشَاشَةُ: but in a marginal<br>\
note it is stated that there is an omission in this explanation, the right rendering being هشاشة الشَّىْءِ<br>\
المأْكُولِ. (TA.) One says, هُوَ ذُو تَحَتُّمٍ [It is<br>\
soft, yielding, crummy, or easily broken: explained<br>\
in the K by هَشَاشٌ, which is evidently a mistranscription for هَشَاشٌ, syn. with هَشٌّ]. (S, K.)<br>\
And هُوَ غَضُّ المُتَحَتَّمِ [It is fresh, juicy, sappy,<br>\
or moist, in its soft, yielding, crummy, or crumbling, nature; مُتَحَتَّمٌ being a regular inf. n.]<br>\

one part upon another. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He ate a thing<br>\
that was soft, yielding, crummy, or easily broken,<br>\
in his mouth. (Lth, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He ate the حُتَامَة, i. e.,<br>\
the food that remained upon the table, or what<br>\
fell from it during eating, (K, TA,) of the crumbs<br>\
of bread &amp;c. (TA.) It is said in a trad. that he<br>\
who eats and does this will enter Paradise. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  تحتّم لِكَذَا He was, or became, cheerful, brisk,<br>\
lively, or sprightly, by reason of such a thing. (K.)<br>\
7<br>\
انحتم It (a thing, or an affair, or event,)<br>\
was, or became, absolutely, or decisively, or irreversibly, necessary, requisite, or unavoidable; as<br>\
also ↓ تحتّم. (Msb.)<br>\

حَتْمٌ [inf. n. of 1: when used as a simple subst.,]<br>\
A decree, an ordinance, a sentence, or a judicial<br>\
decision; (S, K;) accord. to some, adapted to a<br>\
particular case: (TA:) pl. حُتُومٌ. (S, K.) It is<br>\
said in the Kur [xix. 72], كَانَ عَلَى رَبِّكَ حَتْمًا<br>\
مَقْضِيًّا [It is imposed by Himself upon thy Lord<br>\
as a decree judicially decided]. (TA.) And<br>\
Umeiyeh Ibn-Abi-s-Salt says,<br>\
عِبَادُكَ يُخْطِئُونَ وَأَنْتَ رَبٌّ<br>\
بِكَفَّيْكَ المَنَايَا والحُتُومُ<br>\
[Thy servants sin: and Thou art a Lord: in thy<br>\
hands are the decrees and the judicial decisions].<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [As a term of the law, it is sometimes<br>\
used instead of قَضَآءٌ as opposed to أَدَآءٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
[an inf. n. used as an epithet, signifying] Necessary, requisite, or unavoidable; that must<br>\
inevitably be done [or suffered]: (TA:) or indissoluble and irreversible: as in the phrase قَضَآءٌ حَتْمٌ<br>\
[an indissoluble and irreversible decree or ordinance or sentence or judicial decision]. (Msb in<br>\
art. جزم.) ―<br>\

حَاتِمٌ A judge; or one who decrees, ordains, or<br>\

حُتُومٌ, (K,) like as شُهُودٌ is pl. of شَاهِدٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] because, as they [the Arabs] hold, or<br>\
assert, it necessitates separation, or departure,<br>\
(بِالفِرَاقِ ↓ يَحْتِمُ,) (S, Msb, TA,) i. e. يُوجِبُ,<br>\
(Msb,) by its croaking, (Msb, TA,) الحَاتِمُ signifies The غُرَاب [a name applied to any species<br>\
of crow; and here, app., particularly to the raven]: (Msb:) or the black غُرَاب: (S, K:) and<br>\
[the bird called] غُرَابُ البَيْنِ, [see art. بين,] which<br>\
is red in the beak and legs: (K:) said by Lh to<br>\
be that which is fond of plucking out its feathers,<br>\
and which is held to be of evil omen. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And [hence,] حَاتِمٌ signifies also Unlucky, or inauspicious. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also أَحْتَمُ.<br>\
حَنْتَمْ, of the measure فَنْعَلٌ, signifies A green<br>\
jar (خَزَفٌ أَخْضَرُ, meaning جِرَّةٌ): it is also applied<br>\
to anything [of the colour termed] أَسْوَد: and<br>\
الأَخْضَرُ is, with the Arabs, أَسْوَدُ [which may mean<br>\
either that green is, with the Arabs, termed اسود,<br>\
or that الاخضر is, with the Arabs, black; but the<br>\
former appears to be the right meaning: see<br>\
أَسْوَدُ]. (Msb.) [See أَخْضَرُ: and see also what<br>\
here follows.]<br>\
أَحْتَمُ Anything (TA) black; (K, TA;) as also<br>\
