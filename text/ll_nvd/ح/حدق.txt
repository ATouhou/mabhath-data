حَدِقَ, (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. حُدُوقٌ, said of one that is dying (مَيِّت),<br>\

say of anything, احدق به as meaning It surrounded, encompassed, or encircled, it; (TA;)<br>\

حَدَقَةٌ (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ حُنْدُوقَةُ and<br>\
↓ حِنْدِيقَةٌ, (K,) but IDrd doubts the correctness<br>\

(TA;) the greater black of the eye; (S, TA;)<br>\

by the white; the iris, together with the whole of<br>\
the anterior chamber of the eye;] what is in the<br>\

el-Insán:”) or, as some say, externally, the black<br>\
of the eye; and internally, its خَرَزَة [or lens]:<br>\
(TA:) [and sometimes the eye, absolutely; as,<br>\
for instance, in a phrase mentioned voce ذَابَ, in<br>\
art. ذوب:] pl. ↓ حَدَقٌ, (S, Msb, K) [or rather<br>\
this is a coll. gen. n.,] and [the pl. is] أَحْدَاقٌ [a<br>\
pl. of pauc.] (K) and حَدَقَاتٌ (Msb) and حِدَاقٌ;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) which last is applied by Aboo-Dhu-eyb to the حَدَقَة together with what surrounds it. (TA.) [Hence,] ↓ تَكَلَّمْتُ عَلَى حَدَقِ<br>\
القَوْمِ I spoke while the people, or party, looked<br>\
at me. (TA.) And ↓ رُمَاةُ الحَدَقِ Those who hit<br>\

نَزَلُوا فِى مِثْلِ حَدَقَةِ البَعِيرِ (tropical:)  They alighted, or<br>\
alighted and abode, in a tract abounding with<br>\

حَدِيقَةٌ A walled garden; a garden surrounded<br>\

any round piece of land surrounded by a fence or<br>\
the like, or by elevated land: (TA:) or whatever<br>\
is surrounded by building: (K:) and, by extension of its application, a garden, though without a<br>\
wall: (Msb:) or a meadow, or garden, (رَوْضَة,)<br>\
having trees: (S, K:) or a garden of palm-trees<br>\
and of other trees, (Zj, IDrd, K,) dense and<br>\

fruit-bearing: (TA:) or a garden (جَنَّة) of palmtrees and grape-vines: (TA:) or a distinct collection of palm-trees: (K:) or a plot of seedproduce: (Kr, TA:) or a hollow in a valley,<br>\
that retains water: and any depressed place in a<br>\
valley, that retains water, thought water be not in<br>\
its bottom: (TA:) pl. حَدَائِقُ. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
Hence the saying, وَ رَدَ عَلَىَّ كِتَابُكَ فَتَنَزَّهْتُ فِى<br>\

have recreated myself in contemplating the beauty<br>\
of its garden-like phrases]. (TA.)<br>\
حُدَلِقَةٌ (mentioned in the K in art. حدلق) A<br>\
large حَدَقَة [or black of the eye]: (S, K:) a<br>\

A&#39;Obeyd says, it is some part of the body<br>\
thereof, but I know not what it is: (S:) or the<br>\
eye: (S, K:) so says Lh; (S;) and so Kr:<br>\
(TA:) As heard an Arab of the desert, of the<br>\

epiglottis]. (IB, TA.) ―<br>\
