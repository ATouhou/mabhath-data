-b2-  [Used as<br>\
a simple subst., it signifies A narrative, story,<br>\
or tale:] pl. حَكَايَاتٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  As a conventional term in grammar, [meaning Imitation, or<br>\
conforming, in language,] it is of two kinds:<br>\
حِكَايَةُ جُمْلَةٍ [The imitation of a proposition, or<br>\
phrase], and حِكَايَةُ مُفْرَدٍ [The imitation of a<br>\
single word]: the former is of two sorts; one of<br>\
which is termed حِكَايَةُ مَلْفُوظٍ [The imitation of<br>\
a thing uttered], whereof قَالُوا الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ [They<br>\
said, “Praise be to God,” (Kur vii. 41,)] is an<br>\
ex.; and the other, حِكَايَةُ مَكْتُوبٍ [The imitation<br>\
of a thing written], whereof قَرَأْتُ عَلَى فَصِّهِ مُحَمَّدٌ<br>\
رَسُولُ اللّٰهِ [I read upon his ring-stone, “Mohammad is the Apostle of God,”] is an ex.: and the<br>\
latter kind, also, (that of a single word,) is of<br>\
two sorts; one of which is with the interrogative أَىٌّ or مَنْ, as when, to one who says, رَأَيْتُ<br>\
رَجُلًا [pronounced رَجُلَا, I saw a man], you say,<br>\
أَيَّا [What (man)?], or مَنَا [Whom?], and the<br>\
like, which sort is agreeable with a common<br>\
rule; the other sort being without an interrogative, as the saying of one of the Arabs, to one<br>\
who said, هَاتَانِ تَمْرَتَانِ [These are two dates],<br>\
دَعْنَا مِنْ تَمْرَتَانِ [Abstain thou from troubling<br>\
us about two dates], which sort is anomalous.<br>\
(El-Ashmoonee&#39;s Expos. of the Alfeeyeh of Ibn-Málik.) [حِكَايَةُ صَوْتٍ signifies A word imitative<br>\
of a sound; an onomatopœia: see اِسْمُ صَوْتٍ<br>\
in art. سمو.]<br>\
