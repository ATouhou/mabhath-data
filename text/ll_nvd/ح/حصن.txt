also,] خَيْلُ العَرَبِ حُصُونُهَا ذُكُرُهَا وَإِنَاثُهَا (tropical:)  [The<br>\
horses of the Arabs are their حُصُون; the males<br>\
thereof and the females thereof]. (TA.) A man<br>\
said to &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-El-Hasan, “My father<br>\
has left the third of his property for the حُصُون: ”<br>\
and he replied “ Buy thou horses: ” so in the A:<br>\
in the M, “Buy thou therewith horses, and mount<br>\
[men] on them [to fight] in the cause of God. ”<br>\

حَصَانٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ حَاصِنٌ (S, Mgh,<br>\
K) and ↓ حَاصِنَةٌ (K) and ↓ حَصْنَآءُ (S, K) and<br>\
↓ مُحْصِنَةٌ (Th, S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ مُحْصَنَةٌ,<br>\
(Th, S, Msb, K,) applied to a woman, Continent,<br>\
or chaste; or abstaining from what is not lawful<br>\
nor decorous, (Th, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) or from that<br>\
which induces suspicion or evil opinion: (Sh and<br>\
TA in explanation of the first of these epithets:) or<br>\
married; having a husband: (K:) or حَصَانٌ has<br>\
both of these significations: (Ham p. 101:) and<br>\
accord. to Th, (S,) ↓ مُحْصَنَةٌ, with fet-h only, has<br>\
the latter signification; (S, Mgh, * Msb; *) and<br>\
means caused to be continent or chaste, or to abstain from that which is unlawful or indecorous,<br>\
by her husband: (Mgh: [and the same is implied<br>\
in the S:]) and this epithet is also applied to a<br>\
woman emancipated: and to one having become<br>\
a Muslimeh: (Az, TA:) [certain particular applications of ↓ مُحْصِنَةٌ have been implicatively<br>\
shown above: see 4:] the pl. of حَصَانٌ is حُصُنٌ<br>\
and حَصَانَاتٌ: and the pl. of ↓ حَاصِنٌ and ↓ حَاصِنَةٌ<br>\
is حَوَاصِنُ and حَاصَنَاتٌ: the former of which<br>\
(حواصن) also signifies pregnant, (K,) applied to<br>\
women: (TA:) the pl. محصنات, in the first<br>\
instance of its occurrence in ch. iv. [verse 28] of<br>\
the Kur, is read by all ↓ مُحْصَنَات, (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
TA,) meaning having husbands; (A &#39;Obeyd, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA;) because when such women are made<br>\
captives, their marriage-tie is cut: but in other<br>\
instances, some read thus, understanding it in the<br>\
sense last explained; and others read ↓ مُحْصِنَات,<br>\
as meaning that have become Muslimehs:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, TA:) in the Kur iv. 29, it means<br>\
free women: and in the Kur v. 7, continent, or<br>\
chaste, women: (Mgh: [in the Msb, it is said<br>\
to have the latter of these last two meaning in<br>\
iv. 29, and the former of them in v. 7:])<br>\
↓ مُحْصَنَات is the more common in the language<br>\
of the Arabs. (Fr, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  حَصَانٌ also signifies<br>\
A pearl, or a large pearl; syn. دُرَّةٌ: (K:) because it is protected in the interior of the shell<br>\
that contains it. (TA.)<br>\
حِصَانٌ A generous, or high-bred, horse, (Msb,<br>\
K,) of whose seed one is niggardly: (K:) or a<br>\
male horse: (Mgh, K:) or this latter is a<br>\
secondary meaning, originating from frequency<br>\
of usage: (S, Msb:) or a stallion horse; or one<br>\
fit to cover: (TA voce رَاحَ:) the حِصَان is. so<br>\
called because he preserves his rider: (TA:) or<br>\
because his back is like the حِصْن to his rider;<br>\
(Mgh, Msb;) wherefore horses are called حُصُونٌ:<br>\
(Mgh:) or because one is niggardly of his seed,<br>\
so that he is not made to cover any but a generous mare: (S, Mgh, Msb:) pl. حُصُنٌ. (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K.)<br>\
حَصِبينٌ, applied to a place, (Msb, TA,) or to<br>\

fortified, or protected against attack, so that one<br>\
cannot gain access to what is within it; (see<br>\
حَصُنَ, of which it is the part. n.;)] a building<br>\
that protects him who has recourse to it for<br>\
refuge. (Sb, TA.) ―<br>\

or compactly made: (K:) or trusty, or trusted<br>\
in, having the rings [for الخلق in the L and TA,<br>\
I read الحَلَق,] near together; such that weapons<br>\
produce no effect upon it: (Sh, L, TA:) so called<br>\
because it is [as] a حِصْن to the body. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
حُصَيْنٌ dim. of حِصْنٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,] أَبُوالحُصَيْنِ<br>\

former anomalous [if أُحْصِنَ be not allowable<br>\
as meaning, like أَحْصَنَ, “he married,” or “ took<br>\
a wife: ” but see 1 and 4]. (S, Msb.) For the<br>\
