لَا تَحْزَنْ and لَا تَحْزَنُوا, in the Kur [ix. 40, &amp;c.,<br>\
and iii. 133], do not denote a prohibition of<br>\
getting حُزْن; for حُزْن does not come by the<br>\
will of man: the real meaning is Do not thou,<br>\
and ye, that which engenders حُزْن; do not thou,<br>\
and ye, acquire حُزْن. (Er-Rághib. [But this<br>\
requires consideration; or, rather, is not in every<br>\
case admissible.])<br>\

aor. of the former is used, but not the pret.;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) and when the act is ascribed to<br>\
God, the latter verb is used: Z, also, says that<br>\
what is well known in usage is the employing<br>\
the pret. of the latter and the aor. of the former:<br>\
(TA:) or احزنهُ signifies he made him حَزِين<br>\
