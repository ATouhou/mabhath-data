and حَلُوَ, aor.<br>\

and حَلْوٌ and حُلْوَانٌ; (K;) It (a thing, S, Msb)<br>\
was, or became, sweet; (S, K;) as also ↓ احلولى;<br>\
(S, K;) or this latter signifies it was, or became,<br>\

حَلُوَ, inf. n. حَلَاوَةٌ, [The fruit<br>\

and حَلَاوَةٌ. (TA.) تَحْلَى بِهِ العَيْنُ is an inverted<br>\
phrase, used by a poet, for يَحْلَى بِالْعَيْنِ. (S.)<br>\
It has been said that حَلِىَ فِى عَيْنِى (ISd, and K<br>\
in art. حلى) and فِى صَدْرى (ISd) is from الحَلْىُ,<br>\
(ISd, K,) meaning the thing that is worn, because<br>\
it signifies It was beautiful in my eye, like the<br>\
حَلْى; not from حَلَاوَةٌ; (ISd, and TA in art.<br>\
حلى;) but this saying is not valid, nor approved.<br>\
(TA in the present art.) Accord. to Lh, one says,<br>\
حَلِيَتِ المَرْأَةُ بِعَيْنِى and فِى عَيْنِى, and بِقَلْبِى and<br>\

inf. n. حَلَاوَةٌ; (TK;) and ↓ استحلاهُ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) from الحَلَاوَةُ, like استجادهُ from الجَوْدَةُ, (S,)<br>\

اِعْرَوْرَيْتُ الفَرَسَ; (S;) all signify the same; (K;)<br>\
He esteemed the thing sweet [both properly and<br>\
metaphorically as is indicated in the TA]: (Msb<br>\

TK in explanation of all of them:) and [in like<br>\
manner] ↓ أَحْلَيْتُهُ I found it to be sweet: (S, K:)<br>\
or this signifies I made it sweet: (K:) or it has<br>\

found, this place to be sweet, or pleasant]. (TA.)<br>\

[in the CK حُلْوٌ, and حُلُوٌّ also,] and حُلْوَانٌ, He<br>\
gave him in marriage his daughter, or his sister,<br>\
(K, TA,) or any woman, (TA,) for a certain<br>\
dowry, on the condition that he should assign to<br>\

made it sweet; (S, K;) namely, food; (S;) or a<br>\
thing; (K;) as also ↓ احلاهُ: (S:) and so حَلَّأَهُ,<br>\
which is anomalous: (K:) sometimes they said,<br>\
حَلَّأْتُ السَّوِيقَ [I sweetened the meal of parched<br>\
barley, or the mess made thereof]; pronouncing<br>\
with hemz that which is not [properly] with hemz:<br>\
(S:) this is said by Lth to be a mistake on their<br>\

(TA.) مَا يُمِرُّ وَمَا يُحْلِى (assumed tropical:)  He says not a bitter<br>\

thing nor a sweet thing. (K.) [See a similar<br>\
phrase near the middle of the first paragraph.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
See also another signification in the first paragraph. ―<br>\
-b4-  مَا أَحْلَاهُ [How sweet, &amp;c., is it!] is<br>\
said by some to be an instance of a verb having<br>\
a dim. form; so that you say, ↓ مَا أُحَيْلَاهُ [How<br>\
