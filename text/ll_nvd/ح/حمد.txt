حَمِدَهُ, aor.<br>\
حَمَدَ, inf. n. حَمْدٌ (S, L, Msb, K)<br>\
and مَحْمَدٌ and مَحْمِدٌ (L, K) and مَحْمَدَةٌ (S,<br>\
L, K) and مَحْمِدَةٌ; (L, K, and so in a copy of<br>\
the S;) the last of these inf. ns. [and the third<br>\
also] extr.; (L;) or the last is an inf. n. and the<br>\
last but one signifies “ a praiseworthy quality,”<br>\
or “ a quality for which one is praised; ” (ElFenáree, MF;) or the last may be a simple subst.;<br>\
(Har p. 392;) He praised, eulogized, or commended, him; spoke well of him; mentioned him<br>\
with approbation; (Akh, S, L, Msb;) عَلَى كَذَا<br>\
for such a thing; (L, Msb;) contr. of ذَمَّهُ:<br>\
(S, L:) accord. to IAmb, formed by transposition<br>\
from مَدَحَ: (marginal note in a copy of the MS:)<br>\
but it is of less common application than the latter<br>\
verb; (Msb in art. مدح;) signifying he praised<br>\
him, &amp;c., for something depending on his (the<br>\
latter&#39;s) own will: thus, the describing a pearl<br>\
as clear is not حَمْدٌ, but it is مَدْحٌ: (Kull p. 150:)<br>\
or i. q. شَكَرَهُ: (Lh, K:) but it differs [sometimes]<br>\
from this; (Msb;) for شُكْرٌ is only on account of<br>\
favour received; whereas حَمْدٌ is sometimes<br>\
because of favour received, (Th, Az, Msb,) and<br>\
sometimes from other causes; (Th;) [and thus]<br>\
the latter is of more common application than the<br>\
former; (S;) therefore you do not say, شَكَرْتُهُ<br>\
عَلَى شَجَاعَتِهِ; but you say, حَمِدْتُهُ على شجاعته<br>\
I praised him, &amp;c., for his courage. (Msb.)<br>\
حمد also implies admiration: and it implies the<br>\
magnifying, or honouring, of the object thereof;<br>\
and lowliness, humility, or submissiveness, in the<br>\
person who offers it; as in the saying of the<br>\
afflicted, الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ Praise be to God; since in<br>\
this case there is no worldly blessing, favour, or<br>\
benefit. (Msb.) This last phrase is generally<br>\
pronounced as it is written above: but some of<br>\
the Arabs are related to have pronounced it<br>\
الحَمْدَ لِلّٰهِ, putting the former word in the accus.<br>\
case as the absolute complement of the verb<br>\
أَحْمَدُ understood: and others, الحَمْدِلِلّٰهِ; assimilating the final vowel of the former word to the<br>\
vowel immediately following it: and others,<br>\
الحَمْدُ لُلّٰهِ; assimilating the first vowel in للّٰه to<br>\
the vowel immediately preceding it: Zj, however,<br>\
disapproves of the latter two modes of pronouncing it: some of them also said, بَدَأْتُ<br>\
بِالحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ, meaning I began with the saying<br>\
Praise be to God. (L.) [See also حَمْدٌ below.]<br>\
You say, أَحْمَدُ إِلَيْكَ اللّٰهَ I praise God (Az, A, * L,<br>\
K) to thee, or in thy presence: (L:) or with thee:<br>\
(Kh, Az:) or I praise to thee God&#39;s benefits, and<br>\
his blessings, or favours; or I praise to thee<br>\
God&#39;s blessings, or favours, and discourse to thee of<br>\
them. (L.) And حَمِدَ لَهُ أَمْرًا (tropical:)  He approved of<br>\
a thing for him. (L, K. *) And حَمِدَ إِلَيْهِ أَمْرًا<br>\
(tropical:)  He approved of a thing for him, and commanded, or enjoined, him to do it. (L.) And<br>\
جاوَرْتُهُ فَمَا حَمِدْتُ جِوَارَهُ (tropical:)  [I became his neighbour, and did not approve of being so]. (A.)<br>\
See also 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (aor. and inf. n. as above in<br>\
the beginning of this art., K,) He recompensed,<br>\
or requited, him: he gave him, or paid him, his<br>\
due. (L, K.)<br>\
-A2-  حَمِدَ عَلَيْهِ, aor.<br>\
حَمَدَ, (L, K, *) inf. n.<br>\
حَمَدٌ, (TA,) He was angry with him. (L, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
حمّد, inf. n. تَحْمِيدٌ, has a more intensive<br>\
signification than حَمدَ; (S;) [He declared the<br>\
praises of God: or] he praised God much, with<br>\
good forms of praise (بِالمَحَامِدِ الحَسَنَةِ): (T, L:)<br>\
or repeatedly; or time after time. (L, K.) تحميد<br>\
[used as a simple subst.] has a pl., namely, تَحَامِيدُ.<br>\
(A.) [See an ex. voce خَاتَمٌ, in the latter part of<br>\
the paragraph.]<br>\
4<br>\
احمد He (a man, S) came to a state, or<br>\
result, such as was praised, or commended, or<br>\
approved; properly, his affair, or case, came to<br>\
such a state or result: (S, L, K:) or (so in the<br>\
K, but in the L “ and ”) he did, or said, that<br>\
for which he should be praised, or commended;<br>\
or that which was praiseworthy, or commendable;<br>\
(A, L, K; *) contr. of أَذَمَّ. (A.) And احمد أَمْرُهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  His affair, or case, was, or became, praiseworthy, or approvable, in his estimation: (K:)<br>\
or احمد أَمْرَهُ (as in the L) he esteemed his affair,<br>\
or case, praiseworthy, or approvable. (L [agreeably with what next follows].)<br>\
-A2-  احمدهُ He found<br>\
him (a man, A, L) [or it] to be such as is praised,<br>\
commended, or approved; or praiseworthy, commendable, or approvable; (S, A, L, Msb;) contr.<br>\
of أَذَمَّهُ: (TA in art. ذم:) he made it manifest<br>\
that he was worthy of praise, eulogy, commendation, or approbation: (L:) he approved of his<br>\
action, and his course of conduct, or his tenet or<br>\
tenets, and did not expose it, or them, to others.<br>\
(K.) And أَحْمَدْتُ صَنِيعَهُ (tropical:)  [I found his action<br>\
to be praiseworthy, or commendable, or approvable]. (A.) And احمد الأَرْضَ (tropical:)  He approved<br>\
the land as a dwelling-place: (A:) or he found<br>\
the land to be such as is praised, commended, or<br>\
approved; as also ↓ حَمِدَهَا; (L, K;) but the<br>\
former verb is the more chaste in this sense. (L.)<br>\
And احمد مَوْضِعًا (tropical:)  He found a place to be such<br>\
as is praised, commended, or approved, and convenient, or suitable, so that he approved it as a<br>\
dwelling-place, or for its pasture. (S, L.)<br>\
5<br>\
تحمّد He affected, or made a show of,<br>\
(تَكَلَّفَ,) praise. (A.) You say, ↓ وَجَدْتُهُ مُتَحَمِّدًا<br>\
مُتَشَكِّرًا [I found him affecting, or making a show<br>\
of, praise and thanks]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He praised himself. (KL.) [Golius assigns this meaning to<br>\
↓ احتمد, as on the authority of the KL; but it<br>\
is not assigned to this verb in my copy of the<br>\
KL.] ―<br>\
-b3-  فُلَانٌ يَتَحَمَّدُ النّاس [app. a slight mistranscription, for لِلنَّاسِ, i. q. إِلَى النَّاسِ, as in an<br>\
ex. in the next sentence but one,] Such a one<br>\
pretends to men, or shows them, that he is praiseworthy, بِجُودِهِ for his liberality. (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  تحمّد<br>\
عَلَيْهِ He reproached him for a favour, or benefit,<br>\
which he (the former) had bestowed, or conferred;<br>\
or recounted his gifts, or actions, to him; syn.<br>\
اِمْتَنَّ. (S, L, K.) One says, مَنْ أَنْفَقَ مَالَهُ عَلَى<br>\
نَفْسِهِ فَلَا يَتَحَمَّدْ بِهِ عَلَى النَّاسِ [Whoso expends his<br>\
property upon himself, he shall not reproach men<br>\
therewith as for favours, or benefits, bestowed]:<br>\
(S, A:) or فلا يتحمّد بِه إِلَى النَّاسِ [he shall not<br>\
pretend to men that he is praiseworthy on account<br>\
of it]: a prov., meaning that a man is not praised<br>\
for his beneficence to himself, but for his beneficence to others. (L.)<br>\
6<br>\
تحامدوا (tropical:)  [They praised, or commended, a<br>\
thing, one to another]. You say, الرُّعَآءُ يَتَحَامَدُونَ<br>\
الكَلَأَ (tropical:)  [The pastors praise, or commend, one to<br>\
another, the herbage]. (A.)<br>\
8<br>\
احتمد: see 5.<br>\
-A2-  Said of heat, [It burned,<br>\
or burned fiercely; or was, or became, vehement:]<br>\
formed by transposition from احتدم. (S.)<br>\
10<br>\
اِسْتَحْمِدِ اللّٰهَ إِلَى خَلْقِهِ بِإِحْسَانِهِ إِلَيْهِمْ وإِنْعَامِهِ<br>\
عَلَيْهِمْ [so I find it written, as though meaning<br>\
Demand thou, of his creatures, the praising of<br>\
God, by reason of his beneficence to them, and<br>\
his bounty to them: but I think that we should<br>\
read اِسْتَحْمَدَ اللّٰهُ, and that the meaning is, God<br>\
hath demanded praise of his creatures by his<br>\
beneficence, &amp;c.]. (A.)<br>\
حَمْدٌ Praise, eulogy, or commendation; &amp;c.<br>\
(S, &amp;c. [For further explanations of this word,<br>\
and respecting the phrase الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ and its variations, see 1: and see also شَكَرَ.]) سُبْحَانَكَ اللّٰهُمَّ<br>\
وَبِحَمْدِكَ, said by a person praying, means [I<br>\
extol, or celebrate, or declare, thy remoteness, or<br>\
freedom, from every impurity, or imperfection,<br>\
&amp;c., O God, (see art. سبح,)] and I begin with<br>\
praising Thee; أَبْتَدِئُ being understood: (Az,<br>\
L, Msb:) or by بحمدك is meant الحَمْدُ لَكَ<br>\
praise be to Thee: and nearly the same is said<br>\
in explanation of the phrase in the Kur [ii. 28],<br>\
نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ, that by بحمدك is meant حَامِدِينَ<br>\
لَكَ: [see, again, art. سبح:] or by the expression<br>\
وبحمدك is meant, accord. to Aboo-&#39;Othmán ElMázinee, and by praising Thee I extol thy<br>\
remoteness, or freedom, from every impurity,<br>\
&amp;c.; سَبَّحْتُكَ being understood: or the و is redundant, as it is in the phrase, رَبَّنَاوَلَكَ الحَمْدُ [O<br>\
our Lord, praise be to Thee], in which the و is<br>\
sometimes omitted: or, accord. to Aboo-&#39;Amr<br>\
Ibn-El-&#39;Alà, the و is corroborative, as in the<br>\
phrase, وَهُوَ لَكَ, for هُوَ لَكَ. (Msb.) لِوَآءُ الحَمْدِ<br>\
بِيَدِى يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ [The standard of praise shall<br>\
be in my hand on the day of resurrection (said by<br>\
Mohammad)] means that he shall be singularly<br>\
distinguished by praise, or praising, on that day.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See حَمَادِ: ―<br>\
-b3-  and حُمَادَاكَ.<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
حَمِيدٌ.<br>\
-A3-  It is also said to signify The young one<br>\
of the kind of bird called قَطًا: so in the prov.,<br>\
حمْدُ قَطَاةٍ يَسْتَمِى الأَرَانِبَ<br>\
A young one of a katà desires to make the hares<br>\
its prey: applied to a weak man who desires to<br>\
insnare a strong one. (Meyd, TA.)<br>\
-A4-  See also<br>\
what next follows.<br>\
حَمَدَةٌ The sound of the flaming, or blazing,<br>\
of fire; (S, K;) as also حَدَمَةٌ [from which it is<br>\
formed by transposition: see 8: and ↓ حَمْدٌ app.<br>\
signifies the same: see حَدْمٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
حُمَدَةٌ: see حَمَّادٌ.<br>\
حَمَادِ لَهُ Praise, and thanks, be to him: (S,<br>\
L, K:) i. e., to such a one: (S, L:) contr. of<br>\
جَمَادِ لَهُ [q. v.]. (S and A in art. جمد.) حَمَادِ is<br>\
indecl., with kesr for its termination, because it<br>\
deviates from its original, which is the inf. n.<br>\
[↓ الحَمْدُ]: (S, L:) [i. e.,] it is [a quasi-inf. n.,<br>\
(see اِسْمُ مَصْدَرٍ in art. صدر,) being] a proper<br>\
name for المَحْمَدَةُ [as syn. with الحَمْدُ]. (Sharh<br>\
Shudhoor edh-Dhahab.)<br>\
حَمُودٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
حَمِيدٌ and ↓ مَحْمُودٌ (S, A, L, K) and ↓ حَمُودٌ<br>\
(as in copies of the K, but this seems to be an<br>\
intensive epithet,) Praised, eulogized, or commended; spoken well of; mentioned with approbation; approved; such as is praised, &amp;c.;<br>\
praiseworthy, laudable; commendable, or approvable: (S, L, K: [in which, as well as in<br>\
numberless exs., all these significations are clearly<br>\
indicated, though not so clearly explained; the<br>\
Arabic words to which they apply exactly agreeing<br>\
with the Latin “ laudatus,” which means both<br>\
“ praised ” and “ praiseworthy: ”]) the fem. of<br>\
the first is with ة, (L, K,) because the signification,<br>\
though properly that of a pass. part. n., nearly<br>\
agrees with that of an act. part. n.: (L:) you<br>\
say, [هِىَ حَمِيدَةٌ She is praised, &amp;c.; and] أَفْعَالُهُ<br>\
حَمِيدَةٌ (tropical:)  [His actions are praised, &amp;c.]. (A.)<br>\
↓ حَمْدٌ, also, [originally an inf. n., like its contr.<br>\
ذَمٌّ,] used as an epithet applied to a man, is syn.<br>\
with مَحْمُودٌ; (K;) and as an epithet applied to<br>\
a woman, syn. with مَحْمُودَةٌ, (TA,) as is also<br>\
حَمْدَةٌ: (K, TA:) and you likewise say مَنْزِلٌ<br>\
حَمْدٌ (K) and مَنْزِلَهٌ حَمْدَةٌ (Lh) (assumed tropical:)  A place where<br>\
one alights, sojourns, or abides, such as is praised,<br>\
or approved, (K, TA,) and convenient, or suitable.<br>\
(TA.) الحَمِيدُ, meaning He who is praised, or<br>\
praiseworthy, in every case, is an epithet applied<br>\
to God; one of the names termed الأَسْمَآءُ الحُسْنَى.<br>\
(L.) ↓ المَقَامُ المَحْمُودُ [mentioned in the Kur<br>\
xvii. 81] means (assumed tropical:)  The station in which its occupant shall be praised by all creatures [on the day<br>\
of resurrection] because of his being quickly reckoned with, and relieved from long standing: or it<br>\
is the station of the intercessor. (L.)<br>\
حُمَادَاكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا (S, L, K *) and ↓ حَمْدُكَ<br>\
(L) The utmost of thy power, or of thine ability,<br>\
[or the utmost of thy praiseworthy actions, (see<br>\
an ex. of the pl. in what follows,) will be] thy<br>\
doing such a thing; syn. مَبْلَغُ جَهْدِكَ, (L,) or<br>\
قُصَارَاكَ, (S, L,) and غَايَتُكَ: (S, L, K:) and in<br>\
like manner, حُمَادِى The utmost of my power,<br>\
&amp;c. (K.) حُمَادَيَاتُ النِّسَآءِ غَضُّ الطَّرْفِ, said by<br>\
Umm-Selemeh, means The utmost of the praiseworthy qualities of women is the lowering of the<br>\
eye. (L.)<br>\
حَمَّادٌ (TA) and ↓ حُمَدَةٌ (A, K) A man (TA)<br>\
who praises things much; a great, or frequent,<br>\
praiser: (A, K, TA:) or the latter, a man who<br>\
praises things much and extravagantly. (S.)<br>\
You say, إِنَّهُ لَحَمَّادٌ لِلّٰهِ Verily he is one who praises<br>\
God much, or repeatedly, or time after time.<br>\
(L, K.)<br>\
العَوْدُ أَحْمَدُ is a prov., (S,) meaning (tropical:)  Repetition<br>\
is more attributive of praise (أَكْثَرُ حَمْدًا): (S,<br>\
A, K:) for generally you do not desire to return<br>\
to a thing save after experience, or knowledge,<br>\
[and approbation,] thereof: [the act of returning,<br>\
therefore, implies praise:] or the meaning is,<br>\
when one begins a kind act, he attracts praise to<br>\
himself; and when one repeats, he gains more<br>\
praise for himself: or احمد is from the pass.<br>\
part. n., and the meaning is, the beginning is<br>\
praised, or praiseworthy; and repetition is more<br>\
deserving of being praised. (K.) [See Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Arab. Prov. ii. 130]<br>\
مَحْمَدَةٌ (S, Mgh) and مَحْمِدَةٌ (Mgh) (assumed tropical:)  [A<br>\
cause of praise, commendation, or approval; a<br>\
praiseworthy, commendable, or approvable, quality or action;] a thing for which one is, or is to<br>\
be, praised, commended, or approved: (Mgh:)<br>\
[see 1, first sentence:] contr. of مَذَمَّةٌ: (S:)<br>\
[pl. مَحَامِدُ.] You say, هٰذَا طَعَامٌ لَيْسَتْ عِنْدَهُ<br>\
مَحْمِدَةٌ, with kesr to the second م, (tropical:)  [This is food<br>\
in which is no approvable quality;] the eating of<br>\
which is not approved. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [The pl.] مَحَامِدُ<br>\
signifies [also] (assumed tropical:)  Forms of praise. (Msb in art.<br>\
جمع; &amp;c.) [See 2.]<br>\
مُحَمَّدٌ A man praised much, or repeatedly, or<br>\
time after time: (L, K:) endowed with many<br>\
praiseworthy qualities. (S, L.)<br>\
مَحْمُودٌ: see حَمِيدٌ, in two places.<br>\
يَوْمٌ مُحْتَمِدٌ A day intensely, or vehemently,<br>\
hot: (K:) as also مُحْتَدِمٌ [from which it is<br>\
formed by transposition: see 8]. (TA.)<br>\
مُتَحَمِّدٌ: see 5.<br>\
