حَشَّ, (Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
حَشُ3َ, [contr. to general<br>\
rule in the case of an intrans. v. of this class,<br>\
unless the sec. pers. of the pret. be حَشُشْتَ, which<br>\
seems to be not improbable,] inf. n. حَشٌّ, (Msb,)<br>\
It (a plant, or herbage, Msb, or a shoot of a<br>\
palm-tree cut off from the mother-tree, or plucked<br>\
forth from the ground, and planted, K) dried, or<br>\
dried up. (Msb, K.) [Accord. to my copy of the<br>\
Msb, the same is said of a well; but I incline to<br>\
think that بِئْر is here written by mistake for تِبْن<br>\
(meaning straw) or some similar word.] You say<br>\
also, حَشَّ الوَلَد, (IAar, S, A, K,) aor. and inf. n.<br>\
as above, (TA,) or inf. n. حُشُوشٌ, (IAar,) and,<br>\
as some say, حُشَّ; (A&#39;Obeyd, S;) and ↓ استحشّ;<br>\
(TA;) The child, or young one, (S, A, K,) of a<br>\
she-camel, (IAar,) dried up in the belly, (S, A,<br>\
K,) or womb, (TA,) the time of the birth having<br>\
been exceeded. (TA.) And حَشَّتِ اليَدُ, (A, K,)<br>\
and حُشَّت, (Yoo,) and ↓ احشّث, (S, K,) and<br>\
↓ استحشّت, (Yoo, K,) The arm, or hand, dried<br>\
up; (S, A;) and became unsound in its veins or<br>\
ducts, and so rendered motionless; syn. شُلَّت:<br>\
(S, K:) or, as some say, became slender and<br>\
small. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  حَشَّهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
حَشُ3َ, [in<br>\
this case agreeable with general rule,] inf. n. حَشٌّ,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) He cut it, namely, حَشِيش [or dry<br>\
herbage]: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) and he collected<br>\
it; as also ↓ احتشّهُ: (TA:) or the former has the<br>\
former signification [only]; and ↓ the latter signifies he sought it, and collected it. (S, K, TA.)<br>\
You say also, حَشَّ لِبَعِيرِهِ He collected dry herbage<br>\
(حَشِيش) for his camel. (TA in art. بقل.) And<br>\
حَشَّ عَلَى دَابَّتِهِ He cut dry herbage (حشيش) for<br>\
his beast. (TA.) And حَشَّ عَلَى غَنَمِهِ He beat<br>\
the branches of the trees so that its leaves became<br>\
scattered [for, or upon, his sheep or goats]; like<br>\
هَشَّ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S, K,) aor. as above, (S,<br>\
A, K,) and so the inf. n., (TA,) He threw to him<br>\
(namely a horse) حَشِيش [or dry herbage]; (S,<br>\
K;) he fed him therewith. (A, TA.) Az says, I<br>\
have heard the Arabs say to a man حُشَّ فَرَسَكَ<br>\
[Feed thou thy horse with dry herbage]. (TA.)<br>\
Hence the prov., أَحُشُّكَ وَ تَرُوثُنِى [I feed thee with<br>\
dry herbage and thou dungest upon me]: (S, A,<br>\
K:) and if it were said with س [أَحُسُّكَ, “I<br>\
carry thee,”] it would not be strange: (S:) applied to him who does evil to one who does good<br>\
to him: (Az, K:) or to any one to whom a<br>\
benefit has been done and who requites it with<br>\
the contrary thereof, or is not grateful for it nor<br>\
profits by it: and thus the prov. is related in the T<br>\
and S and M and A [and K]; but by &#39;Abd-es-Selám<br>\
El-Basree, أَحُشَّكِ وَ تَرُوثِينَنِى. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence,<br>\
(A,) حَشَّ النَّارَ, (S, A, K,) aor. and inf. n. as<br>\
above, (S,) and Az adds بِالْحَطَبِ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
kindled the fire; or made it to burn, or to burn<br>\
fiercely; (S, A, K;) and fed it with firewood,<br>\
like as one feeds a beast with حَشِيش: (A, TA:)<br>\
or he collected to it what was scattered of the firewood: (TA:) and he stirred it. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
حَشَّ الحَرْبَ, aor. and inf. n. as above, (tropical:)  He kindled,<br>\
and excited, or provoked, war, or the war. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And حَشَّ فُلَانًا (tropical:)  He improved, or made good,<br>\
the condition, (A, K,) or property, (O,) of such<br>\
a one. (A, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And حَشَّ مَالَهُ (tropical:)  He multiplied his property, or made it to be much, (A,<br>\
K, *) by [adding to it] the property of another:<br>\
(A:) or حَشَّ بِهِ مَالًا he put property into, or<br>\
among, his property: (Skr:) or he strengthened<br>\
him with property. (El-Báhilee.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And حَشَّ<br>\
سَهْمَهُ, (S, A, O,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,)<br>\
(tropical:)  He feathered his arrow: (A, O:) or stuck the<br>\
feathers upon the sides of his arrow: (S:) or<br>\
mounted them upon his arrow. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
احشّ It (herbage) became in such a state<br>\
that it might be cut (ISh, K) and gathered,<br>\
(TA,) being dried up. (ISh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَحَشَّتِ اليَدُ:<br>\
see حَشَّت. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also احشّت She (a woman, S and<br>\
K, and a camel, TA) had her child, or young one,<br>\
dried up in her belly. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  أَحَشَّ اللّٰهُ يَدَهُ<br>\
[May God make his arm, or hand, to dry up;<br>\
or to become unsound in its veins or ducts, and so<br>\
rendered motionless;] is a form of imprecation<br>\
used by the Arabs. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  احشّ فُلَانًا He cut<br>\
(K) and collected (TA) حَشِيش [or dry herbage]<br>\
with such a one; (K;) as though he helped him<br>\
in doing so. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
احتشّهُ: see حَشَّهُ, in two places.<br>\
10<br>\
استحشّ الوَلَدُ; and استحشّت اليَدُ: see<br>\
حَشَّ; and حَشَّت.<br>\
حَشٌّ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ حُشٌّ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) but the former is the more common, (Msb,)<br>\
and ↓ حِشٌّ, (K,) A garden: (El-Fárábee, S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K: *) or a garden of palm-trees: (AHát,<br>\
Msb:) pl. حِشَّانٌ (S, Msb) and حُشَّانٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (tropical:)  A privy; (El- Fárábee, S, A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K;) likewise called بَيْتُ الحَشِّ or ↓ الحُشِّ:<br>\
(Msb:) because they used to ease themselves in<br>\
the gardens: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) then, when<br>\
they made privies, they applied thus this appellation: (Msb:) and in like manner, ↓ مَحَشٌّ; but<br>\
accord. to the Abridgment of the &#39;Eyn., this is<br>\
proper, not tropical: (Msb:) or this last, also<br>\
written ↓ مِحَشٌّ, signifies the same; (TA;) or a<br>\
place in which human ordure has become collected: (K:) the pl. of حشّ as applied to a privy<br>\
is حُشُوشٌ (S, Mgh, K) and حُشُّونَ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád,<br>\
K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also مَحَشَّةٌ.<br>\

حَشُوشٌ جَنِينُهَا [Having her fœtus dried up in<br>\
her womb]. (L from a verse of Ibn-Mukbil.)<br>\
حَشِيشٌ Dry herbage; (Msb;) dry pasture, or<br>\
fodder: (El-Fárábee, S, Mgh, Msb, K:) of the<br>\
measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) what is fresh is not so called: (S, Msb:)<br>\
but عُشْبٌ is applied to what is fresh and what is<br>\
dry: this, says ISd, is the opinion of the generality of the lexicologists: some [he adds] assert<br>\
that حشيش is green pasture or herbage, as well<br>\
as dry: but he says that this is not correct; [and<br>\
the like is said in the Msb;] for this word is properly applied to denote dryness and contraction:<br>\
ISh says that it is applied to all herbs, or leguminous plants, fresh as well as dry; as also عَلَفٌ<br>\
and خَلًى: Az says that when they use it unrestricted, the Arabs mean thereby حَلِىّ, [which is<br>\
the herb called نَصِىّ when it has become dry and<br>\
white,] in particular; and that this is the best<br>\
kind of fodder; that horses thrive upon it, and it<br>\
is one of the best pastures for camels, or for<br>\
camels and sheep and goats; a good supply in<br>\
years of scarcity: (TA:) or it signifies cut herbage or pasture; and is of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the<br>\
sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: (Msb:) the n. un.<br>\
is with ة, signifying a fascicle, or wisp, of حَشيش:<br>\
(TA:) [and sometimes a herb of any kind: the pl.<br>\
is حَشَائِشُ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is also applied, in the present<br>\
day, to Hemp, used for its intoxicating property;<br>\
both fresh and dry: app. what is termed حَشِيشُ<br>\
الحَرَافِيشِ in the K, voce بَنْجٌ, q. v.: and also<br>\
termed حَشِيشَةٌ الفَقَرَآءِ: see De Sacy&#39;s “ Chrest.<br>\
Arabe,”, see. ed., vol. i. pp. 210-283. ―<br>\
-b3-  حَشِيشَةُ<br>\
السُّلْطَانِ: see خَرْدَلٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  حَشِيشٌ also signifies A<br>\
child, or young one, that has dried up in the belly<br>\
of its mother; (Mgh, Msb, TA;) and so ↓ حَشٌّ<br>\
and ↓ مَحْشُوشٌ and ↓ أُحْشُوشٌ: (TA:) or حُشٌّ<br>\
[and the rest], a child, or young one, that perishes<br>\
in the belly of its mother. (K.) It is said in a<br>\
trad., فَأَلْقَتْ حشِيشًا And she cast forth a child, or<br>\
young one, dried up. (Mgh.) And you say,<br>\
أَلْقَتْ وَلَدَهَا حَشِيشًا She (a camel) cast forth her<br>\
young one dried up. (Msb.)<br>\
حُشَاشَةٌ The [last] remains of the spirit (S, A, *<br>\
Msb, K) in the heart, (TA,) [or of life;] in a<br>\
sick man, (S, Msb, K,) and in one who is wounded;<br>\
(K;) as also ↓ حُشَاشٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the ة being<br>\
sometimes elided. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  Any remains,<br>\
or relic. (TA.) You say, مَا بَقِىَ مِنَ المُرُوْءَةِ إِلَّا<br>\
حُشَاشَةٌ تَتَرَدَّدُ فِى أَحْشَآءِ مُحْتَضَرٍ (tropical:)  [There remained<br>\
not, of manliness, save a last relic going to and<br>\
fro, or wavering, in the entrails of one at the<br>\
point of death]. (A, TA.) And مَا بَقِىَ مِنَ الشَّمْسِ<br>\
إِلَّا حُشَاشَةٌ نَازِعٌ (tropical:)  [There remained not, of the sun,<br>\
save a last departing relic]. (A, TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
حَشَائِشِىٌّ One skilled in the knowledge of herbs:<br>\
so in modern works. ―<br>\
-b2-  Accord. to Golius, as on<br>\
the authority of the KL, but not in my copy of<br>\
that work, A collector of hay; a forager.]<br>\
حُشَّاشٌ, [pl. of ↓ حَاشٌّ,] Cutters, or cutters and<br>\
collectors, of حَشِيش [or dry herbage]: (TA:) or<br>\

حَاشٌّ: see its pl. حُشَّاشٌ.<br>\
أُحْشُوشٌ: see حَشِيشٌ, last signification.<br>\
مَحَشٌّ, (S, A, TA,) or ↓ مِحَشٌّ, (K, [but this<br>\
seems to be a mistake occasioned by the accidental<br>\
omission of وَالمَحَشُّ, as is indicated by the addition of وَيُكْسَرُ shortly after, referring to the word<br>\
in a sense different from that which is here next<br>\
mentioned,] A place, (S,) or land, (K,) in which<br>\
is much حَشِيش [or dry herbage]; (S, K) as also<br>\
↓ مَحَشَّةٌ: (K:) or a place in which one cuts<br>\
حشيش: (A:) and the first (مَحَشٌّ) a place in<br>\
which are much pasture, or herbage, and wealth,<br>\
or good things. (K.) You say, هٰذَا مَحَشُّ صِدْقٍ,<br>\
meaning This is a [good] region abounding in<br>\
حَشِيش. (TA.) And إِنَّكَ بِمَحَشِّ صِدْقٍ فَلَا تَبْرَحْهُ<br>\
Verily thou art in a place abounding in good<br>\
things, therefore do not quit it: so in some copies<br>\
of the S; and accord. to this explanation, the<br>\
word is tropically used: in other copies of the S,<br>\
in a place abounding in حَشِيش. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also حَشٌّ. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also the former, A thing in which<br>\
حَشِيش is put; and so ↓ مِحَشٌّ; but the former is<br>\
the more chaste; (A &#39;Obeyd, S, K;) and ↓ مِحَشَّةٌ,<br>\
(K,) and ↓ مَحَشَّةٌ, which is more chaste; so in<br>\
some copies of the K; (TA:) and ↓ حُشَاشٌ, like<br>\
غُرَابٌ; of which the pl. is أَحْشِشَةٌ: (TA:) the<br>\
first two of these words are applied to a woollen<br>\
كِسَآء [q. v.] in which حَشِيش is put: (IAth:)<br>\
and ↓ حِشَاشٌ, with kesr, signifies a [sack of the<br>\
kind called] جُوَالِق in which is حَشِيش. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
See also مِحَشٌّ.<br>\
مُحِشٌّ A woman, (S, K,) and a she-camel,<br>\
(TA,) whose child, or young one, dries up in her<br>\
belly. (S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  An arm, or a hand, (يَد,)<br>\

dry herbage] is cut; (A &#39;Obeyd, S;) as also<br>\
↓ حُشَّاشٌ, like رُمَّانٌ: (TA:) or a plain [i. e. not<br>\
serrated] مِنْجَل [or reaping-hook] with which<br>\
حَشِيش is cut; as also ↓ مَحَشٌّ; but the former is<br>\
the more chaste; (K;) or, accord. to the L, the<br>\
latter is the better. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also مَحَشٌّ, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
-A3-  Also An iron instrument with<br>\
which a fire is stirred; and so ↓ مِحَشَّةٌ: (S, K:)<br>\
pl. مَحَاشُّ. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, (tropical:)  A kindler, an exciter, or a provoker, of war: or] a courageous<br>\
man. (K.) Of such one says, نِعْمَ مِحَشُّ الكَتِيبَةِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Excellent is the exciter of the army, or troop].<br>\
(S, A.) And مِحَشُّ حَرْبٍ signifies (tropical:)  A kindler<br>\
