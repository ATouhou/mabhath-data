حَدَا الإِبِلَ, (S, Mgh,) or حَدَ بِالإِبِلِ, (Msb,)<br>\
or both, (K) and حُدَآءٌ (S, K) and حِدَآءٌ, (K,) He<br>\
drove the camels; (S, Mgh, K;) and chid them:<br>\
(K:) [and ↓ احتداها app. has the former signification:] and he sang to them: (S:) or he urged,<br>\
or excited, the camels by singing to them, which<br>\
is termed ↓ حُدَآءٌ: (Msb:) or حَدَا لَهَا signifies he<br>\
sang to them. (Mgh.) The Arabs in driving<br>\
their camels used commonly to sing verses of the<br>\
kind termed رَجَز. (TA in art. رجز.) [It is said<br>\
that] ↓ حُدَآءٌ originated from the fact of a DesertArab&#39;s beating his young man, or boy, and biting<br>\
his fingers; whereupon he went along saying<br>\
دَىْ دَىْ, meaning يَا يَدَىَّ [“ O my two hands! ”];<br>\
and the camels went on at his cry; therefore his<br>\
master bade him keep to it: (K in art. دى:)<br>\
so says IAar. (TA in that art. [Other (similar)<br>\
accounts of its origin are mentioned by MF in<br>\
remarking on this passage of the K.]) حَدَا signifies also He raised his voice with [the singing<br>\
termed] الحُدَآء. (Har p. 576.) [And He breathed<br>\
short (anhelavit), and sent forth a voice or sound.<br>\
(Golius, from a gloss in the KL.)] ―<br>\
-b2-  You say<br>\
also of the north wind, تَحْدُو السَّحَابَ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  It<br>\
drives along the clouds. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And حَدَاهُ عَلَى<br>\
كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He urged him, incited him, or put him in<br>\
motion or action, to do such a thing. (Msb, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And حَدَاهُ (assumed tropical:)  It followed it; namely, the night<br>\
the day; (K;) as also ↓ احتداهُ: (AHn, K:) and<br>\
so the [wild] he-ass his she-asses; and anything<br>\
any other thing. (TA.) Hence the saying, لَا<br>\
أَفْعَلُهُ مَا حَدَا اللَّيْلُ النَّهَارَ (assumed tropical:)  I will not do it as long<br>\
as the night follows the day]. (TA.) ―<br>\

تحدّاهُ, in its primary sense, is form الحُدَآءُ,<br>\
and signifies He (a driver of camels) vied, competed, or contended for superiority, with him,<br>\
or emulated him, (namely, another driver,) in<br>\
driving camels, or urging them by singing to<br>\
them; each of them desiring to elicit the ability<br>\
of the other in doing so. (Z, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,]<br>\
He vied, or competed, and contended for superiority, with him, (S, K, * mentioned in the K<br>\
in art. حدى,) in an action or a work [of any<br>\
kind]. (S.) You say, تَحَدَّيْتُ النَّاسَ القُرْآنَ I<br>\
sought to elicit the ability of the people in order<br>\
that it might be known which of us was most<br>\
skilled in reading or reciting [the Kur-án]: it<br>\
means like as does the saying of a person contending with others for the superior glory of his<br>\
people, “Bring ye a people like my people, or<br>\
like one of them. ” (Msb.) It is said of Mohammad, in a trad., تَحَدَّى العَرَبَ بِالقُرْآنِ [He vied,<br>\
or contended, with the Arabs by means of the<br>\
Kur-án]. (TA.) And one says, تَحَدَّى صَاحِبَهُ القِرَآءَةَ,<br>\
and الصِّرَاعَ, [He vied, or contended, with his companion in reading, or reciting, and in wrestling,]<br>\
in order that it might be seen which of them was<br>\
the superior reader or reciter, and the superior<br>\
wrestler. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also He aimed at it; made<br>\
it his object; sought, endeavoured after, pursued,<br>\
or endeavoured to reach or attain or obtain, it;<br>\
intended or purposed it; (AA, and K * and TA<br>\
in art. حدى;) as also ↓ حَدَاهُ, (AA, TA,) and<br>\
↓ احداهُ. (Sgh, and K ib.) Hence the saying of<br>\
Mujáhid, كُنْتُ أَتَحَدَّى القُرْآنَ فَأَقْرَأُ [I used to<br>\
aim at reading, or reciting, the Kur-án, and so to<br>\
read, or recite]. (AA, TA.)<br>\

-A2-  [One who<br>\
vies, or competes, and contends for superiority.]<br>\
You say, أَنَا حُدَيَّاكَ بِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ [I am he who vies,<br>\
&amp;c., with thee in this affair], meaning come forth<br>\
to me as an adversary, by thyself alone, (T, S, *<br>\
K, * TA,) and compete, or contend, with me [in<br>\
this affair]. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And هُوَ حُدَيَّاهُمْ He<br>\
aims at them; makes them his object; seeks, endeavours after, pursues, or endeavours to reach,<br>\
or attain, them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And هٰذَا حُدَيَّا هٰذَا<br>\
This is the like, or like in form, of this. (As,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And حُدَيَّا النَّاسِ One of the men or<br>\
people. (Kr, K.)<br>\

حَادٍ Driving or a driver [of camels; or urging<br>\
or exciting them, or one who urges or excites<br>\
them, by singing to them: see 1]: (Mgh:) pl.<br>\

[which latter is an intensive epithet]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It<br>\
is also applied to a [wild] he-ass, as meaning<br>\
Driving before him his she-asses. (S, * TA.) He<br>\
is said to be حَادِى ثَلَاثٍ [A driver before him of<br>\
three she-asses], (S, TA,) and حَادِى ثَمَانٍ [a driver<br>\
before him of eight she-asses]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  حَادِى<br>\
النَّجْمِ [lit. The driver, or urger, of the asterism]<br>\
means الدَّبَرَانُ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  the Hyades; or the five<br>\
chief stars thereof; or the brightest star thereof,<br>\
a of Taurus]: (TA:) and so حَادِى النُّجُومِ<br>\

Aiming at a thing; &amp;c. (AA, TA.)<br>\
