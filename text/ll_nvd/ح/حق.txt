حَقَّ, aor.<br>\
حَقِ3َ (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and<br>\
حَقُ3َ, (IDrd,<br>\
Msb, K,) [the latter irregular,] inf. n. حَقَّةٌ (K,<br>\
TA) and حَقٌّ (IDrd, TA) and حُقُوقٌ, (TA,)<br>\
i. q. صَارَ حَقًّا [i. e., accord. to the primary meaning of حَقٌّ, as explained below, on the authority<br>\
of Er-Rághib, It was, or became, suitable to the<br>\
requirements of wisdom, justice, right or rightness, truth, or reality or fact; or to the exigencies<br>\
of the case]: (TA:) it was, or became, just,<br>\
proper, right, correct, or true; authentic, genuine,<br>\
sound, valid, substantial, or real; established, or<br>\
confirmed, as a truth or fact: and necessitated,<br>\
necessary, requisite, or unavoidable; binding,<br>\
obligatory, incumbent, or due: syn. وَجَبَ; (T,<br>\
S, Msb, K, &amp;c.;) and ثَبَتَ: (Msb, TA:) it was, or<br>\
became, a manifest and an indubitable fact or event;<br>\
as explained by IDrd in the Jm; (TA;) it happened, betided, or befell, surely, without doubt or<br>\
uncertainty. (K.) It is said in the Kur xxxvi. 6,<br>\
لَقَدْ حَقَّ القَوْلُ عَلَى أَكْثَرِهِمْ, i. e. The saying,<br>\
“ I will assuredly fill Hell with genii and men<br>\
together,” [Kur xi. 120 and xxxii. 13,] (Bd,) or<br>\
the sentence of punishment, (Jel,) hath become<br>\
necessitated [as suitable to the requirements of<br>\
justice, or as being just or right,] to take effect<br>\
upon the greater number of them; syn. وَجَبَ,<br>\
(Jel, TA,) and ثَبَتَ. (TA.) And this, namely,<br>\
ثَبَتَ, is the meaning of the verb in the phrase,<br>\
حَقَّ عَلَيْكَ القَضَآءُ [The sentence was, or, emphatically, is, necessitated as suitable to the requirements of justice to take effect upon thee; or it<br>\
was, or is, necessary, just, or right, that the<br>\
sentence should take effect upon thee]. (TA.)<br>\
[In like manner,] one says, يَحِقُّ عَلَيْكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ<br>\
كَذَا It is necessary for thee [as suitable to the<br>\
requirements of wisdom or justice or the like],<br>\
or incumbent on thee, or just or proper or right<br>\
for thee, that thou shouldst do such a thing.<br>\
(TA.) [Thus one says,] الحَقِيقَةُ مَا يَحِقُّ عَلَيْكَ<br>\
أَنْ تَحْمِيَهُ [The حقيقة is that which it is necessary<br>\
for thee &amp;c., or that which it behooveth thee,<br>\
that thou shouldst defend it, or protect it]. (S, *<br>\
K.) Accord. to Sh, the Arabs said, حَقَّ عَلَىَّ أَنْ<br>\
أَفْعَلَ ذٰلِكَ and حُقَّ: but accord. to Fr, when you<br>\
say حَقَّ, you say عَلَيْكَ; and when you say حُقَّ,<br>\
you say لَكَ. (TA.) [Accordingly] one says,<br>\
حُقَّ لَكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ ذَا and حُقِقْتَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَهُ: both<br>\
mean the same: (Ks, S, K:) [i. e., each has one,<br>\
or the other, or both, of the meanings next following:] or the former means It was, or, emphatically, is, rendered حّقّ [or suitable to the<br>\
requirements of wisdom or justice &amp;c.] for thee,<br>\
or necessary for thee, or incumbent on thee, or<br>\
just or proper or right for thee, [or it behooved<br>\
or behooves thee,] that thou shouldst do, or to<br>\
do, this, or that: and [the latter, or] حُقِقْتَ بِأَنْ<br>\
تَفْعَلَ, Thou wast, or, emphatically, art, rendered<br>\
حَقِيق [or adapted, disposed, apt, meet, suited,<br>\
suitable, fitted, fit, proper, competent, or worthy,]<br>\
that thou shouldst do, or to do, this, or that]:<br>\
(A, TA:) and in like manner, حُقَّتْ signifies in<br>\
the Kur lxxxiv. 2 and 5: (Bd, Jel: *) or حُقِقْتَ<br>\
بِأَنْ تَفْعَلَ may mean thou wast, or art, known<br>\
by the testimony of thy circumstances to be حَقِيق<br>\
&amp;c. (A, TA.) And مَا كَانَ يَحُقُّكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَهُ<br>\
[virtually] means the same as مَا حُقَّ لَكَ [best<br>\
rendered in this case It did not behoove thee<br>\
to do it]. (TA.) One says also, حَقَّ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ<br>\
[It was, or, emphatically, is, necessary &amp;c. that<br>\
thou shouldst do or to do such a thing]: but they<br>\
did not say, حَقَقْتَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ. (Fr, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  But<br>\
حَقَّ عَلَىَّ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا means Thy doing so<br>\
distressed, or hath distressed, or afflicted, me;<br>\
or, emphatically, distresses, or afflicts, me; like<br>\
عَزَّ عَلَىَّ. (S and K and TA in art. عز.) And in<br>\
like manner, حَقَّ أَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ [or حَقَّ مَا أَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ]<br>\
means عَزَّ مَا أَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ [It is distressing to me<br>\
that thou art going away]. (TA in art. عز.)<br>\
And لَحَقَّ مَا is used in the same manner as لَعَزَّ مَا,<br>\
q. v. (A and TA in art. عز.) You say also,<br>\
حَقَّتِ الحَاجَةُ Want befell, or betided, or happened,<br>\
and was severe, or distressing: (Msb, TA:)<br>\
[which is said to be] from the phrase, حَقَّتِ<br>\
القِيَامَةُ, aor.<br>\
حَقُ3َ, The resurrection included, or shall<br>\
include, within its sphere [all] the created beings.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  حَقَّتْ, aor.<br>\
حَقِ3َ, (K,) inf. n. حِقَّةٌ (S, *<br>\
Msb, K,) and حِقٌّ, (K,) or, accord. to ISd, it should<br>\
rather be حَقَاقَةٌ and حُقُوقَةٌ, because حِقَّةٌ is used<br>\
as an epithet, [as will be seen below,] and the<br>\
inf. n. in a case like this, by rule, should differ<br>\
from the epithet, (TA,) She (a camel) became<br>\
a حِقّ, or حِقَّة; i. e., entered the fourth year:<br>\
(K:) and ↓ أَحَقَّ, inf. n. إِحْقَاقٌ, he (a camel)<br>\
became a حِقّ: because, so they say, he is then<br>\
fit to be laden: (Msb:) and ↓ احقّت she (a<br>\
young camel) completed three years; (Aboo-Málik, K;) became a حِقَّة; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K;)<br>\
like حَقَّتْ. (TA.) You say, هُوَ حَقٌّ بَيِّنُ الحِقَّةِ<br>\
[He is a حقّ, bearing evidence of being such]:<br>\
(S:) and هِىَ حِقٌّ (K) and حِقَّةٌ (Msb, K) بَيِّنَةُ<br>\
الحِقَّةِ [she is a حقّ or حقّة, bearing evidence<br>\
&amp;c.]: (Msb:) [a phrase] to which a parallel<br>\
is scarcely known, (Msb,) or to which there is<br>\
no parallel (K) except أَسَدٌ بَيِّنُ الأَسَدِ [a lion<br>\
bearing evidence of being like a lion in boldness].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  حِقٌّ [as inf. n. of حَقَّتْ] also signifies<br>\
A she-camel&#39;s overpassing the days [corresponding<br>\
to those] in which she was covered [in the preceding year]: (K:) or her completing [the time<br>\
of] her pregnancy; as also ↓ اِسْتِحْقَاقٌ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And حَقَّتْ and ↓ احقّت and ↓ استحقّت She<br>\
(a camel) became fat. (TA. [See also 8, last<br>\
signification.])<br>\
-A3-  حَقَّهُ, (K,) aor.<br>\
حَقُ3َ, inf. n. حَقٌّ,<br>\
(TA,) He, or it, rendered it [suitable to the<br>\
requirements of wisdom, justice, rightness, truth,<br>\
or reality or fact; or to the exigencies of the<br>\
case; (see the first of the significations in this<br>\
art.;) or] necessary, requisite, or unavoidable;<br>\
binding, obligatory, incumbent, or due; or just,<br>\
proper, or right; syn. أَوْجَبَهُ; (K;) [whence<br>\
حُقَّ لَكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ ذَا, explained above;] as also<br>\
↓ حقّقهُ (K) and ↓ احقّهُ; (S, K;) which last some<br>\
explain by صَيَّرَهُ حَقًّا [meaning as above; or he<br>\
rendered it true;] or صيّره حقًّا لَا شَكَّ فِيهِ [he<br>\
rendered it true, so that there was no doubt<br>\
respecting it]; as also حَقَّهُ, inf. n. حَقٌّ: and حَقَّهُ<br>\
signifies also he established it so that it became<br>\
true and undoubted in his estimation: (TA:)<br>\
or حَقَّهُ signifies, (S, Msb,) or signifies also, (K,)<br>\
he assured, or certified, himself of it; he ascertained it; he was, or became, sure, or certain,<br>\
of it; (A &#39;Obeyd, S, Msb, * K; *) and so ↓ تحقّقه<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, S, K) and ↓ احقّهُ: (S, Msb: *) or he<br>\
pronounced it, or held or believed it, to be established as a necessary truth or fact; as also<br>\
↓ احقّهُ: and ↓ حقّقهُ has a similar, but intensive,<br>\
signification: (Msb:) or ↓ احقّهُ signifies he<br>\
established it as true; or he judged, or decided,<br>\
it to be so: (TA: [contr. of أَبْطَلَهُ: see an ex.,<br>\
from the Kur viii., voce أَبْطَلَ:]) and ↓ حقّقهُ,<br>\
inf. n. تَحْقِيقٌ, signifies صَدَّقَهُ [as meaning he<br>\
verified it, or proved it to be true or veritable; or<br>\
he found it to be true or veritable; both of which<br>\
significations are of very frequent occurrence];<br>\
(S, K;) as also حَقَّهُ, inf. n. حَقٌّ: and accord.<br>\
to IDrd, ↓ حقّقهُ signifies [also] صَدَّقَ قَائِلَهُ [he<br>\
proved, or found, or pronounced, the sayer of<br>\
it to be ture]: and حقّق is also said to signify<br>\
he said, “This thing is the truth; ” like صَدَّقَ.<br>\
(TA.) You say, حَقَقْتُ عَلَيْهِ القَضَآءَ, aor.<br>\
حَقُ3َ, inf. n.<br>\
حَقٌّ, I necessitated the sentence [as suitable to<br>\
the requirements of justice] to take effect upon<br>\
him; or necessitated [as suitable &amp;c.] the taking<br>\
effect of the sentence upon him; syn. أَوْجَبْتُهُ; as<br>\
also ↓ أَحْقَقْتُهُ, inf. n. إِحْقَاقٌ. (TA.) And ↓ أُحِقَّ<br>\
عَلَيْكَ القَضَآءُ The sentence was, or, emphatically,<br>\
is, necessitated [as suitable to the requirements<br>\
of justice] to take effect upon thee; syn. أُثْبِتَ.<br>\
(TA.) And حَقَقْتُ حَذَرَهُ, (S, K,) or حِذْرَهُ, (so<br>\
in one copy of the S,) aor. and inf. n. as above,<br>\
(S,) [I rendered his caution, or fear, necessary;<br>\
or justified it; meaning] I did that of which<br>\
he was cautious, or that which he feared; (S, K;)<br>\
as also حذره ↓ أَحْقَقْتُ: (S:) or, accord. to Az,<br>\
the latter only is right. (TA.) And حَقَقْتُ ظَنَّهُ;<br>\
(Ks, TA;) and ↓ حَقَّقْتُهُ, (Ks, S, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
تَحْقِيقٌ: (S:) both signify the same; (Ks, TA;)<br>\
i. e. صَدَّقْتُ; (S;) which means I found his<br>\
opinion to be true; (Ksh and Bd and Jel, in<br>\
xxxiv. 19;) or proved it to be true: (Ksh, ibid.:)<br>\
and so قَوْلَهُ his saying: (S:) and تَحْقِيقٌ signifies<br>\
[also] the strengthening, or confirming, a saying;<br>\
or making it strong, or firm. (KL.) And أَنَا<br>\
أَحَقُّ لَكُمْ هٰذَا الخَبَرَ I will know, or ascertain,<br>\
the truth, or real nature, of this piece of news<br>\
or information, for you. (TA.) And أَظُنُّهُ وَ لَا<br>\
أَحُقُّهُ [I think it, but I do not know the truth<br>\
of it, or am not certain of it]. (T in art. إِيَّا;<br>\
&amp;c.) And حَقَقْتُ العُقْدَةَ, [written in the TA<br>\
without any syll. signs, so that it may be either<br>\
thus or ↓ حَقَّقْتُهُ; but it is most probably the<br>\
former, as the quasi-pass. is not تحقّقت, but<br>\
انحقّت: it signifies lit. I made the knot right,<br>\
or sure; meaning] (tropical:)  I tied, or made fast, or<br>\
tightened, the knot; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA;) or I<br>\
tied, or tightened, firmly the knot. (A, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\

[He, or it, rendered him حَقِيق, i. e. adapted,<br>\
disposed, apt, meet, suited, suitable, fitted, fit,<br>\
proper, or worthy, to do a thing &amp;c.; whence<br>\
حُقِقْتَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَهُ, or بِأَنْ تَفْعَلَ, explained above.<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  It was necessary for him, or incumbent on<br>\
him, or just or proper or right for him, or it<br>\
behooved him, to do a thing &amp;c.; whence مَا<br>\

but, he adds, disallowed by A &#39;Obeyd. (TA.)<br>\
See 3. ―<br>\
-b5-  Also He (a man) came to him, namely,<br>\
another man; (A &#39;Obeyd, S, K;) and so ↓ احقّهُ.<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, S.) [Hence, app.,] حَقَّتْنِى الشَّمْسُ<br>\

فِى هٰذَا الوِعَآءِ رِطْلًا [app. يَحُقُّ] What is in this<br>\

i. e.,] does not weigh a pound. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  حَقَّ<br>\
الطَّرِيقَ, (K,) aor.<br>\
حَقُ3َ, (TA,) inf. n. حَقٌّ, (TK,)<br>\
He went upon the حَاقّ of the road; (K;) i. e.<br>\

(K:) or, as some say, the head of the upper arm,<br>\
in which is the وَابِلَة. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
حقّقهُ, inf. n. تَحْقِيقٌ: see حَقَّهُ, above, in<br>\
six places. [Hence تَحْقِيقُ الهَمْزَةِ The uttering<br>\
of the hemzeh with its ture, or proper, sound;<br>\
opposed to تَخْفِيفُهَا. Hence also] صَبَغْتُ الثَّوْبَ<br>\
صَبْغًا تَحْقِيقًا I dyed the garment, or piece of cloth,<br>\
with a saturating dyeing. (TA.) And تَحْقِيقٌ<br>\

فِيهِ أَحَدٌ [He disputed, &amp;c., with me, and no one<br>\
had disputed, &amp;c., with me respecting it]. (TA.)<br>\
[But] you say also, ↓ حَاقَقْتُهُ فَحَقَقْتُهُ I disputed,<br>\

due, and I overcame him in doing so. (TA.)<br>\

this trad. is more fully, but somewhat differently,<br>\
cited; and fully explained.])<br>\
-A2-  [Also, app., He<br>\
acted seriously, or in earnest, with him in an<br>\

4<br>\
احقّ, [inf. n. إِحْقَاقٌ,] He spoke truth; said<br>\
what was true: [very common in this sense;<br>\
contr. of أَبْطَلَ:] or he revealed, or manifested,<br>\
or showed, a truth, or a right or due: or he laid<br>\

fat. (TA.) And احقّ القَوْمُ مِنَ الرَّبِيعِ The<br>\

ربيعا (assumed tropical:)  Our camels found [herbage such as is<br>\
termed] ربيع full-grown, and pastured upon it.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
5<br>\

be, a truth, a reality, or a fact.] [Hence,] تحقّق<br>\

true, right, correct, or valid, in his estimation. (S,<br>\
K. *)<br>\
-A2-  تحقّقهُ: see حَقَّهُ.<br>\
6<br>\
تَحَاقٌّ is syn. with تَخَاصُمٌ; and ↓ اِحْتِقَاقٌ,<br>\
with اِخْتِصَامٌ; [The disputing, litigating, or contending, together;] (S, K;) [for] تَخَاصَمُوا and<br>\
اِخْتَصَمُوا signify the same; (K in art. خصم;)<br>\
[or rather] the meaning of [تحاقّ and] ↓ احتقاق<br>\
is [the disputing, &amp;c., together for a right, or<br>\
due;] each one&#39;s, or every one&#39;s, saying, “The<br>\
right is mine,” and “ with me; ” or demanding<br>\

And فُلَانٌ وَ فُلَانٌ ↓ احتقّ [Such a one and such<br>\
a one disputed, &amp;c., together for a right, or due].<br>\
(S.) One does not say of a single person [تحاقّ<br>\
nor] ↓ احتقّ; like as one does not say of one<br>\
only [تخاصم nor] اختصم. (S.)<br>\
7<br>\
اِنْحَقَّتِ العُقْدَةُ (tropical:)  The knot became tied, or<br>\

-A2-  اِحْتَقَّتْ بِهِ الطَّعْنَةُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The thrust, or piercing, killed him: (AA, K:)<br>\

or (assumed tropical:)  penetrated into his belly, or inside: (L, TA:)<br>\
or hit, or struck, the socket, or turning-place, of<br>\
his hip, which is termed its حُقّ. (K, * TA.) One<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  Such a one shot, or cast, at the objects of the<br>\

lean, or light of flesh; or slender, and lean; or<br>\
lean, and lank in the belly. (S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
احتقّ المَالُ The cattle became fat: (K: [see also<br>\
the last meaning of 1 as an intrans. verb:]) but in<br>\
the A and O and L, احتقّ القَوْمُ the people&#39;s cattle<br>\
became fat, and their fatness ended, or attained<br>\
the extreme point. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استحقّهُ He demanded it as his right, or<br>\
due. (TA.) [And hence,] He had a right, or<br>\
just title or claim, to it; he was, or became, entitled to it; he deserved it, or merited it; syn.<br>\
اِسْتَوْجَبَهُ: (S, Msb, K:) or these two verbs are<br>\
nearly the same; (TA;) [the former meaning<br>\
he was, or became, adapted, disposed, apt, meet,<br>\
suited, suitable, fitted, fit, competent, or proper,<br>\
for it; which is the most proper meaning of the<br>\
phrase صَارَ حَقِيقًا بِهِ, as well as of the verb استحقّ;<br>\
but this verb has also the former of these two<br>\
meanings.] When a man purchases a house, and<br>\
another lays claim to it, and establishes a just<br>\
evidence of his claim, and the judge decides for<br>\
him according to his evidence, one says of him,<br>\
قَدِ اسْتَحَقَّهَا عَلَى المُشْتَرِى [He has a right to it in<br>\
preference to the purchaser]; meaning that he is<br>\
to possess it in preference to the purchaser. (TA.)<br>\

laden]: (S, Msb:) and استحقّ الضِّرَابَ [He was,<br>\

-b2-<br>\
[Hence, It (an action, and anything,) deserved<br>\
it, merited it, or required it.] And استحقّ إِثْمًا<br>\
He did what necessitated sin; (Ksh and Bd and<br>\
Jel in v. 106;) [was guilty of a sin;] and deserved its being said of him that he was a sinner;<br>\
(Ksh ibid.;) i. q. اِسْتَوْجَبَهُ. (TA.) And استحقّوا<br>\
They committed sins for which he who should<br>\
punish them would be excusable, because they deserved punishment; like أَوْجَبُوا, and أَعْذَرُوا, and<br>\

R. Q. 1<br>\
حَقْحَقَ, inf. n. حَقْحَقَةٌ, He went the<br>\
pace, or in the manner, termed حَقْحَقَةٌ; (TA;)<br>\
which means a pace, or manner of going, in which<br>\
the beast is made to exert himself to the very utmost, and which is the most fatiguing to the ظَهْر<br>\
[meaning the camel that is ridden, or the beast<br>\
that carries one]: (S, Mgh, K:) or a journeying<br>\
in the beginning, or first part, of the night; (Lth,<br>\
S, K;) which is forbidden: (Lth, S, TA:) or, as<br>\
some say, the fatiguing a while, and abstaining a<br>\
while: (Lth, TA:) but Az says that Lth is not<br>\
correct in either of his explanations of this word:<br>\
(TA:) or an obstinate persisting in journeying:<br>\
or an obstinate persisting in journeying until the<br>\
camel that one is riding perishes or breaks down:<br>\
(K:) or, accord. to Az, the correct meaning, confirmed by what the Arabs said, is the making the<br>\
camel to go on, and urging him to that which fatigues him, and that which is beyond his power,<br>\
until he breaks down with his rider: or, accord.<br>\
to IAar, the jading of the weak [beast] by hard<br>\
journeying. (TA.) It is related in a trad., that<br>\
Mutarrif Ibn-Esh-Shikhkheer said to his son,<br>\
when he took extraordinary pains in religious<br>\
exercises, (S, TA,) and was immoderate therein,<br>\
(TA,) خَيْرُ الأُمُورِ أَوْسَاطُهَا وَ الحَسَنَةُ بَيْنَ الشَّيْئَيْنِ<br>\
وَ شَرُّ السَّيْرِ [The best of affairs, or actions,<br>\
or cases, are such of them as are between two extremes; and the good action is between the two<br>\
things; and the worst kind of journeying is that<br>\
in which the beast is made to exert himself to the<br>\
very utmost, &amp;c.]: (S, TA:) meaning, pursue<br>\
thou the middle course in religious exercises, and<br>\
burden not thyself, lest thou become disgusted;<br>\
for the best of works is that which is continued,<br>\
though it be small. (TA.)<br>\
حَقٌّ contr. of بَاطِلٌ [used as a subst. and as an<br>\
epithet or act. part. n.]: (S, Msb, K:) or, as an<br>\
inf. n. [and used as a simple subst.], contr. of<br>\
بُطْلَانٌ; and as an act. part. n., and a simple<br>\
epithet, contr. of بَاطِلٌ. (Kull.) [As a subst.,]<br>\
its primary signification is Suitableness to the requirements of wisdom, justice, right, or rightness,<br>\
truth, reality, or fact; or to the exigencies of the<br>\
case; as the suitableness of the foot of a door in<br>\
respect of its socket, for turning round rightly:<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA:) [and particularly] the suitableness of a judgment, and of what involves, or implies, a judgment, [i. e., of a saying, and a religion,<br>\
and a persuasion, or the like, (as will be shown by<br>\
one of the explanations of its meanings as an<br>\
epithet,)] to reality or fact; and the suitableness<br>\
of reality or fact to a judgment: (Kull:) [the<br>\
state, or quality, or property, of being just, proper, right, correct, or true; justness, propriety,<br>\
rightness, correctness, or truth; reality, or fact;<br>\
the state, &amp;c., of being established, or confirmed,<br>\
as a truth or fact; of being necessary, requisite,<br>\
or unavoidable; of being binding, obligatory, incumbent, or due: (as shown above: see 1, first<br>\
sentence:)] and existence in relation to substances,<br>\
absolutely: and everlasting existence [in relation<br>\
to God]: (Kull:) pl. حُقُوقٌ and حِقَاقٌ: it has no<br>\
pl. of pauc. (TA.) As an act. part. n. and a<br>\
simple epithet, it is applied to a judgment [as<br>\
meaning] suitable to reality or fact; and to a<br>\
saying, and a religion, and a persuasion, considered<br>\
as involving, or implying, such a judgment:<br>\
(Kull:) to that which is suitable to the requirements of wisdom, justice, right, or rightness; as<br>\
when one says that every act of God is حَقّ: to a<br>\
belief, in a thing, suitable to the reality of the case;<br>\
as when one says that belief in the resurrection is<br>\
حَقّ: and to an action, and a saying, accordant<br>\
to what is requisite or obligatory, in quality and<br>\
measure and time; as when one says that the<br>\
action of another is حَقّ, and that his saying is حَقّ:<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA:) [thus it signifies just, proper,<br>\
right, correct, or true; authentic, genuine, sound,<br>\
valid, substantial, or real; established, or confirmed, as a truth or fact: and necessary, requisite, or unavoidable: and binding, obligatory,<br>\
incumbent, or due:] also the necessarily-existing<br>\
by his own essence [applied to God; as an epithet<br>\
of Whom it has other meanings assigned to it by<br>\
some, as will be seen below]: and anything<br>\
existing, of an objective kind: (Kull:) existing<br>\
as an established fact, or truth, (K, TA,) so as to<br>\
be undeniable. (TA.) In the saying, هٰذَا عَبْدُ اللّٰهِ<br>\
الحَقَّ لَا البَاطِلَ [This is &#39;Abd-Allah, truly; not<br>\
falsely], the article ال is prefixed as it is in the<br>\
phrase, أَرْسَلَهَا العِرَاكَ; but sometimes it is dropped,<br>\
so that one says حَقًّا لَا بَاطِلًا. (Sb, TA.) And in<br>\
the phrase, لَحَقُّ لَا آتِيكَ, a form of oath, the nom.<br>\
case is used without tenween; but when the ل is<br>\
dropped, one says, حَقًّا لَا آتِيكَ: (S, TA:) [the<br>\
latter means Truly I will not come to thee: the<br>\
former seems to be best explained by what here<br>\
follows:] accord. to the A, لَحَقُّ لَا أَفْعَلُ is originally لَحَقُّ اللّٰهِ لَا أَفْعَلُ [The truth, or existence,<br>\
of God is that by which I swear, I will not do<br>\
such a thing]; the affixed noun [اللّٰه] being suppressed, and meant to be understood. (TA.)<br>\
الحَقُّ بِيَدِى [The right is mine] and الحَقُّ مَعِى<br>\
[The right is with me and الحَقُّ عَلَيْكَ The right is<br>\
against thee, which last is often used as meaning<br>\
thou art in fault, or in the wrong,] are said by<br>\
one disputing, or contending, for a thing. (TA.)<br>\
[And in like manner one says الحَقُّ بِيَدِكَ and<br>\
مَعَكَ as meaning Thou art in the right, and الحَقُّ<br>\
عَلَىَّ as meaning I am in the wrong.] One says<br>\
also, كَانَ ذٰلِكَ عِنْدَ حَقِّ لَقَاحِهَا, and لَقَاحِهَا ↓ حِقِّ<br>\
(tropical:)  That was on the occasion of the establishment of<br>\
the fact of her conception, or pregnancy. (S, A, K, *<br>\
TA.) And هٰذَا العَالِمُ حَقَّ العَالِمِ, [like هٰذَا العَالِمُ<br>\
جِدَّ العَالِمِ,] This is the learned man, the extremely<br>\
learned man. (Sb, TA.) And حَقُّ عَلِيمٍ means<br>\
Very [or extremely] knowing. (Ham p. 139.)<br>\

اليَقِينِ, see art. يقن.] ―<br>\

or pay, and a price: a duty; an obligation:]<br>\
the sing. of حُقُوقٌ. (S, K.) [You say, هٰذَا حَقِّى<br>\
This is my right, or due, &amp;c. And هٰذَا حَقٌّ لِى<br>\
This is a right, or due, belonging to me; or a<br>\
thing due, or owed, to me: or this is a duty to<br>\
me. And هٰذَا حَقٌّ عَلَىَّ This is a right, or due,<br>\
the rendering of which is binding, obligatory, or<br>\
incumbent, on me: or this is my duty. And<br>\
hence, حَقُّ الطَّرِيقِ The duty that relates to the<br>\
road: see art. طرق.] ↓ حَقَّةٌ is a more particular,<br>\
or peculiar, or special, term. (S, K.) You say,<br>\
↓ هٰذِهِ حَقَّتِى [This is my particular, or peculiar,<br>\
or special, right or due &amp;c.: but it is explained as]<br>\
meaning حَقِّى. (S.) And ↓ هٰذِهِ حِقَّتِى This is<br>\
my just, or necessary, or incumbent, right or due<br>\
&amp;c. (K.) ―<br>\
-b8-  A share, or portion; as in the saying, أَعْطِ كُلَّ ذِى حَقٍّ حَقَّهُ Give thou to every<br>\
one to whom belongs a share, or portion, his share,<br>\
or portion, that is appointed, or assigned, to him.<br>\

the privy and the kitchen and the like,] of a house.<br>\
(Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  [A necessary, or requisite, thing.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b12-  A thing, or an event, that is decreed, or destined. (K, TA.) It is said to have this meaning<br>\
in the Kur [xv. 8], in the words, مَا نُنَزِّلُ المَلَائِكَةَ<br>\
إِلَّا بِالحَقِّ [We send not down the angels save with<br>\
that which is decreed, or destined]: (TA:) or, as<br>\
some say, it means here revelation: (Ksh, Bd:)<br>\
or punishment. (Ksh, Bd, Jel.) ―<br>\
-b13-  [And hence,]<br>\
Death. (K.) So accord. to some in the Kur<br>\
[1. 18], where it is said, وَ جَآءَتْ سَكْرَةُ المَوْتِ بِالحَقِّ<br>\
[And the confusion of the intellect by reason of<br>\

applied to Him: (K:) meaning the Really-existing; whose existence and divinity are proved to<br>\

to the requirements of wisdom, justice, right, or<br>\
rightness. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\

more, and most, worthy, or deserving, of it: and he<br>\
has a better, and the best, right to such a thing;<br>\
or a more just, and the most just, title or claim<br>\
to it; or he is more, and most, entitled to it]:<br>\

without the participation of another; as when<br>\
you say, زَيْدٌ أَحَقُّ بِمَالِهِ Zeyd is entitled to his<br>\
property exclusively of any other person: secondly,<br>\
as denoting the possession of a right or title in<br>\
participation with another person, but in a superior degree; as in the saying, الأَيِّمُ أَحَقُّ بِنَفْسِهَا<br>\
مِنْ وَلِيِّهَا, (Msb,) i. e. The woman that has not<br>\

(Msb:) a saying of Mohammad, in which the<br>\
ايّم is opposed to the بِكْر, for it is added that the<br>\
بكر is to be asked her permission: but one reading<br>\
substitutes الثَّيِّبُ for الايّم. (Mgh ubi suprà.) In<br>\
the saying, in the Kur [v. 106], لَشَهَادَتُنَا أَحَقُّ<br>\
مِنْ شَهَادَتِهِمَا, it may be formed from اِسْتَحَقَّ by<br>\
rejection of the augmentative letters, so that the<br>\
meaning is, [Verily our testimony is] more deserving of being accepted [than the testimony of them<br>\
two]: or it may be from حَقَّ الشَّىْءُ signifying<br>\
ثَبَتَ, and so mean more true, or valid. (TA.)<br>\
