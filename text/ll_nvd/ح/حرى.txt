حَرَى, aor. يَحْرِى, (S, K,) inf. n. حَرْىٌ, (S,)<br>\
It (a thing S) decreased, diminished, or waned, (S,<br>\
K, TA,) after increase; (TA;) as does, for instance,<br>\
the moon. (S, TA.) [See an ex. in a verse cited<br>\
in art. است.]<br>\
-A2-  حَرَى أَنْ يَكُونَ ذٰلِكَ i. q. عَسَى<br>\
[May-be, or may-hap, &amp;c., that will be]. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  حَرِىَ بِكَذَا He was, or became, adapted, disposed, apt, meet, suited, suitable, fitted, fit, competent, or proper, for such a thing; or worthy of<br>\
it. (MA.)<br>\
-A4-  حَرَاهُ: see 5.<br>\
4<br>\
احراهُ It (time) caused it (a thing, S) to<br>\
decrease, diminish, or wane. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  مَا أَحْرَاهُ,<br>\
and أَحْرِ بِهِ, How well adapted or disposed, or<br>\
how apt, meet, suited, suitable, fitted, fit, competent, or proper, or how worthy, is he! (S, K.)<br>\
[You say, مَا أَحْرَاهُ بِذٰلِكَ How well adapted or<br>\
disposed, &amp;c., is he for that!]<br>\
5<br>\
تحرّى signifies قَصَدَ الحَرَى; i. e. He<br>\
sought, or repaired to, the vicinage, quarter,<br>\
tract, or region, of a people: this is said to be<br>\
the primary signification: (Mgh:) and تحرّاهُ<br>\
he sought, or repaired to, his vicinage, &amp;c.;<br>\
(قَصَدَ حَرَاهُ;) as also ↓ حَرَاهُ, aor. يَحْرِى: (TA:)<br>\
he aimed at it; made it his object; sought, endeavoured after, pursued, or endeavoured to<br>\
reach or attain or obtain, it; intended or purposed it; namely, a thing. (S, Mgh, Msb, K,<br>\
TA.) Hence, in the Kur [lxxii. 14], فَأُولَائِكَ<br>\
تَحَرَّوْا رَشَدًا Those have aimed at, or sought, &amp;c.,<br>\
a right course. (S, TA.) And تَحَرَّيْتُ مَرْضَاتَهُ I<br>\
aimed at, or sought, &amp;c., his approval. (Mgh.)<br>\
And the trad., تَحَرَّوْا لَيْلَةَ القَدْرِ فِى العَشْرِ الأَوَاخِرِ<br>\
Seek ye the Night of القدر in the last ten [nights<br>\
of Ramadán]. (TA.) — Also He sought what<br>\
was most meet, suitable, fit, proper, or deserving,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) to be done, (S, K,) of two<br>\
things, (Mgh, Msb,) according to the opinion<br>\
predominating in his mind, (S,) فِى الأَمْرِ [in the<br>\
affair, or case]: (Msb:) or he sought, or endeavoured, and strove in seeking, and deciding<br>\
upon, the singling out of a thing, by deed and<br>\
by word. (TA.) — And He tarried, waited,<br>\
or paused in expectation, بِالمَكَانِ in the place.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
حَرًى The vicinage, quarter, tract, or region,<br>\
(As, T, S, IAth, Mgh, K,) of a man, (As, T,<br>\
IAth,) or of a people; (Mgh;) the environs (As,<br>\
T, S) of a man, (As, T,) or of a house; (S;) and<br>\
↓ حَرَاةٌ signifies the same: (S, K:) and [it is<br>\
said that] the former signifies also the place of<br>\
the eggs of an ostrich: (S, K:) and a covert, or<br>\
hiding-place, among trees, of a gazelle: (K, * TA:)<br>\
Lth says that it signifies the place of laying eggs<br>\
of the ostrich; or the covert, or lodging-place, of<br>\
the gazelle: but this is false; for with the Arabs<br>\
the word signifies as explained above on the<br>\
authority of As and the حرى of the place of<br>\
laying eggs of the ostrich, and of the covert of<br>\
the gazelle, is the environs thereof: (T, TA:)<br>\
pl. أَحْرَآءٌ. (K.) You say, اِذْهَبْ فَلَا أَرَيَنَّكَ بِحَرَاىَ<br>\
and ↓ حَرَاتِى [Go thou, so that I may by no<br>\
means see thee in my vicinage, &amp;c.]. (S.) And<br>\
لَا تَطُرْ حَرَانَا Approach not thou our environs.<br>\
(S.) And نَزَلْتُ بِحَرَاهُ and بِعَرَاهُ [I alighted, or<br>\
descended and abode, in his vicinage, &amp;c.]. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  See also حَرِىٌّ, in six places.<br>\
حَرٍ: see حَرِىٌّ, in four places.<br>\
حَرَاةٌ: see حَرًى, in two places.<br>\
حَرِىٌّ Adapted, disposed, apt, meet, suited,<br>\
suitable, fitted, fit, competent, proper, or worthy;<br>\
as also ↓ حَرٍ and ↓ حَرًى, which last has no dual<br>\
nor pl., (S, Msb, K,) nor a fem. form, remaining<br>\
unaltered, because it is [originally] an inf. n.; [see<br>\
a verse cited voce نَقْرٌ;] or, accord. to Lh, one<br>\
may say حَرَيَانِ, because Ks has related that some<br>\
of the Arabs dualize what they do not pluralize:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. of حَرِىٌّ is حَرِيُّونَ and أَحْرِيَآءُ;<br>\
(S, Msb;) and the pl. of حَرِيَّةٌ is حَرِيَّاتٌ and حَرَايَا:<br>\
the pl. of ↓ حَرٍ is أَحْرَآءٌ (S, TA) and حَرُونَ; and<br>\
the pl. of حَرِيَةٌ is حَرِيَاتٌ. (TA.) You say, إِنَّهُ<br>\
لَحَرِىٌّ بِكَذَا, and ↓ لَحَرِ, and ↓ لَحَرًى, (K, TA,)<br>\
Verily he, or it, is adapted, &amp;c., to such a thing;<br>\
or worthy of such a thing. (TA.) And هُوَ حَرِىٌّ<br>\
أَنْ يَفْعَلَ ذَاكَ, and ↓ حَرٍ, and ↓ حَرًى, He is adapted,<br>\
&amp;c., to do that: (S, Msb:) and ان ↓ انّه لَمَحْرًى<br>\
يفعل, (Lh, K, [in some copies of the K, erroneously, لَمَحْرِىٌّ,]) and ↓ لَمَحْرَاةٌ, (K,) which last<br>\
has no dual nor pl. nor fem. form, like مَخْلَقَةٌ<br>\
[q. v.] and مَقْمَنَةٌ: (TA:) and ↓ هٰذَا الأَمْرُ مَحْرَاةٌ<br>\
لِذٰلِكَ [This thing, or affair, is adapted, &amp;c., to<br>\
that]. (S.) And hence the phrase, أَنْ ↓ بِالْحَرَى<br>\
يَكُونَ ذَاكَ (S, * K) It is suitable, fit, or proper,<br>\
that that should be. (PS.) [But this phrase, in<br>\
the present day, means Rather that should be.<br>\
And hence, ↓ كَمْ بِالحَرَى How much rather.]<br>\
One says also, of a man who has attained to fifty<br>\
[years], ↓ فَحَرًى, meaning He is adapted, &amp;c., to<br>\
attain all that is good. (Th, TA.) And one says<br>\
إِنَّهُ لَحَرِىٌّ as meaning Verily it is probable; or<br>\
likely to happen or be, or to have happened or<br>\
been; as also لَخَلِيقٌ. (TA in art. خلق.)<br>\
حِرِىٌّ: see art. حرح.<br>\
حَارٍ masc. of حَارِيَةٌ, (M, TA,) which is an epithet applied to a viper (أَفْعًى); (S, M, K;) meaning That has decreased in its body by reason of<br>\
age; and it is the worst, or most malignant or<br>\
noxious, that is: (S:) or that has become old, and<br>\
has wasted in its body, and whereof there remains<br>\
not save its head and its breath (نَفَسُهَا [in the<br>\
CK نَفْسُهَا]) and its poison: (M, K:) dim. ↓ حُوَيْرٍ.<br>\
(TA.) One says, رَمَاكَ اللّٰهُ بِأَفْعًى حَارِيَةٍ [meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  May God smile thee with an evil like a viper<br>\
wasted by age]. (S.)<br>\
حُوَيْرٍ: see what next precedes.<br>\
أَحْرَى More, and most, adapted, disposed, apt,<br>\
meet, suited, suitable, fitted, fit, competent, or<br>\
proper; or more, and most, worthy, or deserving.<br>\
(S, * Mgh, Msb, K.) A thing is said to be أَحْرَى<br>\
بِالِاسْتِعْمَالِ [More, or most, meet, &amp;c., to be done].<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
