حَسَكَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
حَسَكٌ, (S,) (tropical:)  He bore rancour, malevolence,<br>\
malice, or spite, against me; and enmity: (S:)<br>\
or he was angry with me. (K, TA.)<br>\

أَحْسَكَتِ النَّفَلَةُ The plant of the species termed<br>\
نَفَل [q. v.] put forth a حَسَكَة, i. e. a prickle.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
حَسَكٌ [is applied, app. in the classical language,<br>\
as it is in the present day, to Various species of<br>\
thistle, and other prickly plants: also to the<br>\
heads of thistles and the like: and particularly to<br>\
the caltrop, or tribulus: and hence the explanations here following:] the حَسَك [or prickly<br>\
heads] of the [plant called] سَعْدَان: (S:) or a<br>\
certain herb, (Aboo-Ziyád, Mgh, TA,) inclining<br>\
to yellowness, (Aboo-Ziyád, TA,) having [a head<br>\
of] prickles of rounded form: (Aboo-Ziyád, Mgh,<br>\
TA:) seldom, or never, does any one walk<br>\
upon it, when it has dried up, without putting<br>\
upon his feet boots or sandals: and the ants transport its produce [or heads] to their nests: (Aboo-Ziyád, TA:) a certain plant, the produce [or<br>\
head] whereof (which is rough [or prickly], TA)<br>\
clings to the wool of sheep, (K,) and to the fur<br>\
of camels, in their places of pasturing: (TA:)<br>\
its leaves are like those of purslane (الرِّجْلَة), or<br>\
narrower, and at its leaves are compact and hard<br>\
prickles, having three forks: [hence it seems to<br>\
be a species of three-horned caltrop: or for<br>\
“ three,” we should perhaps read four: (see<br>\
another application of the word in what follows:)]<br>\
the drinking [of an infusion] thereof has the<br>\
effect of crumbling the stone of the kidneys and<br>\
bladder; and the drinking of the expressed juice<br>\
of its leaves is good for the venereal faculty, and<br>\
for difficulty in the discharge of urine, and for<br>\
the bite of vipers; and the sprinkling it in the<br>\
dwelling kills fleas: (K:) also, accord. to Aboo-Nasr, the produce of the [plant called] نَفَل:<br>\
(TA:) and sharp. hard prickles or thorns: (TA<br>\
in art. مسك:) n. un. with ة: (S, Mgh:) which<br>\
some hold to apply to any fruit, or produce, of a<br>\
plant, that is of the kind termed عُقْدَةٌ [i. e.<br>\
forming a compact and roundish head]; and<br>\
hence, to the pod of the cotton-plant: and it also<br>\
signifies a prickle, or thorn. (TA.) [Hence,]<br>\
