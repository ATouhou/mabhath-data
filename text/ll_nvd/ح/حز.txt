act of disobedience because of thy not being easy<br>\
respecting it]. (A. [See حَزَّازٌ, below; and see<br>\
also حَكَّ, and حَاكَ.]) Of anything making an<br>\

حَزَّازٌ Food that becomes acid in the stomach,<br>\
(K, TA,) by reason of its badness, and so [as it<br>\
were] cuts (يَحُزُّ) into the heart. (TA.) Hence<br>\
the saying, أَنْتَ أَثْقَلُ مِنَ الحَزَّازِ [Thou art heavier,<br>\
or more difficult to be born, than the food that<br>\
becomes acid in the stomach, &amp;c.]. (A Heyth, on<br>\

said in a trad., الإِثْمُ حَوَازُّ القُلُوبِ, (S, Mgh, and<br>\
K * in art. حوز,) i. e., Sin is those things that<br>\
make an impression upon hearts, (Lth, Mgh, MS,<br>\
and K ubi suprà,) like as cutting, or notching,<br>\
makes an impression upon a thing, (TA,) and that<br>\
cause one to suspect that they may be acts of disobedience, by reason of uneasiness respecting them,<br>\
(Mgh,) or to waver respecting them, lest they<br>\
should be so, for that reason, (K,) or to be uneasy<br>\
in heart respecting them: (MS:) حوازّ being pl.<br>\
of ↓ حَازَّةٌ, (Mgh, K,) like as دَوَابُّ is pl. of دَابَّةٌ:<br>\
(Mgh:) Sh. reads حُوَّازُ القُلُوبِ, which he explains as meaning, “what overcomes hearts,<br>\
(مَا يَحُوزُهَا, i. e., يَغْلِبُ عَلَيْهَا,) so that they commit that which is not incumbent:” (Mgh, and K *<br>\
