حَمِلَ, inf. n. حَمْلٌ (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K, &amp;c., in some copies of the S حِمْلٌ) and حُمْلَانٌ,<br>\
(Mgh, K,) He bore it, carried it, took it up and<br>\
carried it, conveyed it, or carried it off or away,<br>\
(MA,) عَلَى ظَهْرِهِ (S, MA,) upon his back, or<br>\
عَلَى رَأْسِهِ upon his head; (MA;) and ↓ احتملهُ<br>\
signifies the same: (Msb, K:) or the latter is<br>\
used in relation to an object inconsiderable and<br>\
small in comparison with that in relation to which<br>\
the former is used; as in the saying of En-Nábighah, (TA,)<br>\
إِنَّا اقْتَسَمْنَا خُطَّتَيْنَا بَيْنَنَا<br>\
فَجَارِ ↓ فَحَمَلْتَ بَرَّةَ وَاحْتَمَلْتُ<br>\
[Verily we have divided our two qualities between<br>\
us, and thou hast borne as thy share goodness,<br>\
and I have borne as my share wickedness]. (TA *<br>\
in the present art., and S and TA &amp;c. in arts. بر<br>\
and فجر.) Hence, in the Kur [xx. 100], فَإِنَّهُ<br>\
يَحْمِلُ يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ وِزْرًا [He shall bear, on the day<br>\
of resurrection, a heavy burden]. (TA.) Hence<br>\
also, in the Kur [vii. 189], حَمَلَتْ حَمْلًا خَفِيفًا<br>\
[She bore a light burden]; (S, TA;) i. e., [as<br>\
some say,] the seminal fluid. (TA.) Hence also,<br>\
in the Kur [xxix. 60], وَكَأَيِّنْ مِنْ دَابَّةٍ لَا تَحْمِلُ<br>\
رِزْقَهَا [And how many a beast is there that does<br>\
not bear its sustenance !], meaning, (assumed tropical:)  does not provide its sustenance, but is sustained by God.<br>\
(TA.) يَحْمِلُ الحَطَبَ [lit. He carries firewood],<br>\
(A in art. حطب,) or الحَطَبَ الرَّطْبَ [juicy, or<br>\
fresh, firewood], (Er-Rághib, TA,) means (tropical:)  he<br>\
goes about with calumny, or slander. (A in art.<br>\
حطب, and Er-Rághib * and TA. *) ―<br>\

↓ احتملهُ.] And حَمَلَهُ [alone] He gave him a<br>\
beast upon which to ride. (T, TA. [See Kur<br>\

-b4-  حَمَلَتِ المَرْأَةُ, aor.<br>\
حَمِلَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. حَمْلٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  The woman became pregnant,<br>\
or conceived: (K, TA:) and حَمَلَتْ وَلَدَهَا She<br>\
became pregnant with, or conceived, her child:<br>\
(Msb:) one should not say, حَمَلَتْ بِهِ; or this<br>\
is rare; (K;) or one should not say this, but it<br>\
is frequently said; (IJ, TA;) [for] as حَمَلَتْ is<br>\
syn. with عَلِقَتْ, (Msb, TA,) and the latter is<br>\
trans. by means of بِ the former is thus made<br>\
trans., (TA,) therefore one says, حَمَلَتْ بِهِ فِى لَيْلَةِ<br>\
كَذَا وَفِى مَوْضِعِ كَذَا, meaning She became pregnant with him, or conceived him, in such a night,<br>\
and in such a place. (Msb.) حَمَلَتْ is also said<br>\
of a ewe or she-goat, and of a female beast of<br>\
prey, [and app. of any female,] accord. to IAar;<br>\

meant as the explanation of لا يحمل, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Such<br>\
a one shows (or will not conceal) his anger; and<br>\
thus SM understood it; or as the explanation of<br>\
يحمل alone, i. e. such a one will not show his<br>\

aor.<br>\
حَمِلَ, inf. n. حَمْلٌ, (TA,) means (tropical:)  he showed, or<br>\
manifested, anger. (K, TA.) And hence, it is<br>\

لَمْ يَحْمِلْ خَبَثًا, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [When the water amounts to<br>\

aor.<br>\
حَمِلَ, (assumed tropical:)  He incited, excited, urged, instigated,<br>\

(ISd, K.) ―<br>\
-b20-  [حَمَلَ لَفْظًا عَلَى لَفْظٍ آخَرَ, aor.<br>\
حَمِلَ,<br>\
inf. n. حَمْلٌ, a phrase often used in lexicology and<br>\
grammar, (assumed tropical:)  He made, or held, a word, or an expression, to accord in form, or in meaning, or<br>\
syntactically, with another word, or expression.<br>\
One says, يُحْمَلُ عَلَى الأَكْثَرِ (assumed tropical:)  It (a word) is<br>\
made to accord in form with those words with<br>\
which it may be compared that constitute the<br>\
greater number: thus one says of رَحْمَانُ, which<br>\
is made to accord in form with words of the<br>\
measure فَعْلَانُ, though it has not a fem. of the<br>\
measure فَعْلَى, in preference to فَعْلَانٌ, because<br>\
words of the measure فَعْلَانُ are more numerous<br>\
than those of the measure فَعْلَانٌ. And يُحْمَلُ<br>\
عَلَى نَقِيضِهِ (assumed tropical:)  It (a word) is made to accord in<br>\
form with its contrary in meaning: thus عِجَافٌ,<br>\
an anomalous pl. of أَعْحَفُ, is made to accord. in<br>\
form with سِمَانٌ, a regular pl. of سَمِينٌ. And<br>\
يَحمَلُ عَلَى المَعْنَى (assumed tropical:)  It (a word) is made to accord<br>\
syntactically with its meaning: and يُحْمَلُ عَلَى<br>\
اللَّفْظِ (assumed tropical:)  It is made to accord syntactically with its<br>\
grammatical character: the former is said when,<br>\
in a sentence, we make a mase. word fem., and<br>\
the contrary, because the meaning allows us to<br>\
substitute a fem. syn. for the masc. word, and a<br>\
masc. syn. for the fem. word: for ex., it is said<br>\
in the Kur vi. 78, فَلَمَّا رَأَى الشَّمْسَ بَازِغَةً قَالَ هٰذَا<br>\
رَبِّى “ And when he saw the sun rising, he said,<br>\
This is my Lord: ” here (by saying بازغة) الشمس<br>\
is first made to accord syntactically with its grammatical character (تُحْمَلُ عَلَى اللَّفْظِ); and then<br>\
(by saying هٰذَا instead of هٰذِهِ) it is made to<br>\
accord syntactically with its meaning (تُحْمَلُ عَلَى<br>\
المَعْنَى), which is الجِرْم or the like: this is allowable; but the reverse in respect of order is of<br>\
weak authority; because the meaning is of more<br>\
importance than the grammatical character of the<br>\
word. (Collected from the Kull pp. 156 and 157,<br>\
and other works.)] ―<br>\
-b21-  حَمَلَهُ أَحْسَنَ مَحْيَلٍ (assumed tropical:)  [He<br>\

ابو) ―<br>\

-b23-  عَلَى آخَرَ حَمَلَ شَيْئًا, in<br>\
logic, means (assumed tropical:)  He predicated a thing of another<br>\
thing.] ―<br>\

2<br>\
حمّلهُ الشَّىْءَ, (Msb,) and الرِّسَالَةَ, (S, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. تَحْمِيلٌ, (TA,) He made him, or constrained<br>\
him, to bear or carry [the thing, and the message;<br>\
and in like manner, عَلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ ↓ حَمَلَ]. (S,<br>\
Msb, * TA.) [And حمّلهُ, alone, He loaded him;<br>\
namely, a camel, &amp;c.] You say also, حَمَّلَهُ الأَمْرَ<br>\
↓ فَتَحَمَّلَهُ, inf. n. of the former تَحْمِيلٌ and حِمَّالٌ,<br>\
like كِذَّابٌ, [which is of the dial. of El-Yemen],<br>\
and of the latter verb تَحَمُّلٌ and تِحِمَّالٌ [like<br>\
تِكِلَّامٌ &amp;c.], (K,) (assumed tropical:)  He imposed upon him the<br>\
affair, as a task, or in spite of difficulty or trouble<br>\
or inconvenience, and he undertook it, as a task,<br>\
&amp;c. (Msb in art. كلف.) And حَمَّلْتُهُ أَمْرِى فَمَا<br>\
↓ تَحَمَّلَ (assumed tropical:)  [I imposed upon him my affair, as<br>\
a task, &amp;c., but he did not undertake it]. (TA.)<br>\
It is said in the Kur [xxiv. 53], فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْهِ مَا حُمِّلَ<br>\
وَعَلَيْكُمْ مَا حُمِّلْتُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [Upon him rests only that<br>\
which he has had imposed upon him; and upon you,<br>\
that which ye have had imposed upon you]: i. e.,<br>\
upon the Prophet rests the declaring of that<br>\
which has been revealed to him; and upon you,<br>\
the following him as a guide. (TA.) And رَبَّنَا<br>\
عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِنْ ↓ عَلَيْنَا إِصْرًا كَمَا حَمَلْتَهُ ↓ تَحْمِلٌ<br>\
قَبْلِنَا رَبَّنَا وَلَا تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [O our Lord,<br>\
and do not Thou impose upon us a burden, like<br>\
as Thou imposedst it upon those before us: O<br>\
our Lord, and do not Thou impose upon us that<br>\
which we have not power to bear]: (Kur ii. last<br>\
verse:) or, accord. to one reading, تُحَيِّلْ, which<br>\
has an intensive signification [when followed by<br>\
على]. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [حمّلهُ ذَنْبًا (assumed tropical:)  He charged him<br>\
with a crime, or an offence: see a verse of En-Nábighah cited voce عَرٌّ.]<br>\

to AA, مُحَامَلَةٌ signifies the requiting with beneficence. (TA.)<br>\

(T, S,) that which he was bearing, or carrying:<br>\
(T, TA:) or you say, احملهُ الحِيْلَ he helped<br>\
him to bear, or carry, the load, or burden: and<br>\
↓ حَمَلَهُ, i. e. فَعَلَ ذٰلِكَ بِهِ [he did that with him].<br>\
(M, O, K.) [See also 3.]<br>\
-A2-  أَحْمَلَتْ She (a<br>\

without being pregnant. (S, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تحمّل He took upon himself the bearing, or<br>\
carrying, of loads, or burdens: this is the primary<br>\
signification. (Har p. 48.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, (assumed tropical:)  He burdened himself with, or he became, or made<br>\
himself, chargeable with, or he bore, or took<br>\
upon himself, the burden of, a sin, or crime,<br>\
