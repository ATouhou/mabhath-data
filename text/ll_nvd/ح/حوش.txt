(S, A, K;) as also ↓ أَحَاشَهُ, and ↓ أَحْوَشَهُ, (S, K,)<br>\

-b2-  Hence, (TA,)<br>\

to turn him by deceit, or guile: syn. دَاوَرَهُ: (A,<br>\

[&amp;c.]. (TA.) You say, ظَلِتُ أُحَاوِشُهُ وَأُحَاوِتُهُ<br>\
حَتَّى فَعَلَ [I continued during the day to circumvent him, or to endeavour to induce him to<br>\
turn, &amp;c., and to delude him, or act towards<br>\

he did what I desired: see also what next<br>\
follows]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence,] حَاوَشْتُهُ عَلَيْهِ I<br>\

انحاش عَنْهُ He took fright, and fled from<br>\
him; or was averse from him; and shrank from<br>\
him; (S, * K;) and was frightened at him; and<br>\
was moved by him. (TA.) [In the TA it is here<br>\
added, that this verb is quasi-pass. of الحَوْشُ in<br>\
the sense of النِّفَارُ; but this seems to indicate that<br>\
a copyist has written النفار by mistake for الإِنْفَارُ,<br>\
which is a syn. of the inf. n. of 1 in a sense explained above: so that انحاش signifies He<br>\
became scared, or the like.] Hr mentions this<br>\
verb in art. حيش; but it belongs to the present<br>\
art. (IAth.) You say, زَجَرَهُ فَمَا انْحَاشَ لِزَجْرِهِ<br>\
He chid him (meaning a wolf or other animal)<br>\
but he did not take fright and flee, &amp;c., at his<br>\

one is not moved by, and does not care for, or<br>\
regard, anything, (S, A, TA,) and such a one.<br>\

commonly, بِالصَّيْدِ, (Msb,) The people, or company<br>\
of men, encompassed, or surrounded, the chase,<br>\
or game: (Msb:) or scared it, one, or one party,<br>\

فُلَانًا (A, TA) They encompassed, or surrounded,<br>\
such a one: (A:) or they made such a one to be<br>\

art. حول,)] and ↓ تحاوشوهُ, (K,) or تحاوشوهُ بَيْنَهُمْ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the phrase احتوش الدَّمُ الطُّهْرَ<br>\

state of pureness]; as though the blood encompassed the pureness, and enclosed it on either<br>\
side. (Msb.) [Alluding to the collecting of the<br>\
blood about the uterus previously to menstruation.]<br>\

حَوْشٌ A thing resembling [the kind of enclosure,<br>\
made of trees or of wood, &amp;c, for camels or sheep<br>\

by walls alone: pl. of pauc. أَحْوَاشٌ, and of mult.<br>\

meaning the Benoo-Mahrah-Ibn-Heydán, (TA,)<br>\
and the offspring were the camels called النَّجَائِبُ<br>\
المَهْرِيَّةُ, (Msb, TA,) which scarcely ever become<br>\
tired; and the like of this is said by AHeyth:<br>\
(TA:) it is also said that ↓ الحُوشُ, (S, K,) from<br>\
which the epithet above mentioned, thus applied,<br>\
is a rel. n., (TA,) is the country of the jinn,<br>\
(S, K,) beyond the sands of Yebreen, which no<br>\
man inhabits: (S:) or an appellation of certain<br>\
sons of the jinn, whose country is called بِلَادُ<br>\
الحُوشِ by Ru-beh: (TA:) or it is like الوَحْش:<br>\
