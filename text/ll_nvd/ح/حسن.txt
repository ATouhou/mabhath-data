حَسُنَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) which may also<br>\
be written and pronounced حَسْنَ, with the dammeh<br>\
suppressed, (S,) and حَسَنَ, (K,) aor.<br>\
حَسُنَ, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\
حُسْنٌ (S, * Msb, K, * TA) and حُسْنَى, (Ham p. 657,<br>\
and Bd in ii. 77,) He, or it (a thing, S, Msb),<br>\
had, or possessed, the quality termed حَسْنٌ [which<br>\
see below; i. e., was, or became, good, or goodly,<br>\
(generally the latter,) beautiful, comely, or pleasing,<br>\
&amp;c.; and ↓ تحسّن often signifies the same, as in<br>\
the phrase تحسّن عِنْدَهُ it was, or became, good,<br>\
&amp;c., in his estimation]: (S, K, TA:) and [in like<br>\
manner] زَيْدٌ ↓ أَحْسَنَ means Zeyd became possessed<br>\
of حُسْن. (Mughnee in art. بِ.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One may not<br>\
say حُسْنَ, transferring the dammeh of the س to<br>\
the ح and making the former letter quiescent,<br>\
except in one case; because it is [virtually, together with its agent expressed or implied, in this<br>\
case,] a predicate: [see I&#39;Ak p. 234:] this is<br>\
allowable only in the case of a verb of praise or<br>\
dispraise; حُسْنَ, in respect of the transference of<br>\
the medial vowel, being likened to نِعْمَ and بِئْسَ,<br>\
which are originally نَعِمَ and بَئِسَ: and thus one<br>\
does in all verbs like these two in meaning: a<br>\
poet says,<br>\
لَمْ يَمْنَعِ النَّاسُ مِنِّى مَا أَرَدْتُ وَ مَا<br>\
أُعْطِيهِمُ مَا أَرَادُوا حُسْنَ ذَا أَدَبَا<br>\
[Men have not withheld from me what I have<br>\
desired, nor do I give them what they have desired: good, or very good, is this as a mode of conduct!]: meaning حَسُنَ هٰذَا أَدَبًا. (S, TA.) You<br>\
say also, حَسُنَ زَيْدٌ, [meaning Good, or goodly,<br>\
&amp;c., or very good &amp;c., is Zeyd! or] meaning<br>\
بِهِ ↓ أَحْسِنْ [i. e. how good, or goodly, &amp;c., is Zeyd!<br>\
as also ↓ مَا أَحْسَنَهُ]. (B, TA in art. بِ.)<br>\
2<br>\
حسّنهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَحْسِينٌ, (S,) He made<br>\
it, or rendered it, حَسَن [i. e. good, or goodly,<br>\
(generally the latter,) beautiful, comely, or pleasing, &amp;c.]; (K;) he beautified, embellished, or<br>\
adorned, it; (S, TA;) as also ↓ احسنهُ. (TA.)<br>\
You say, الحَلَّاقُ رَأْسَهُ ↓ أَحْسَنَ The shaver beautified, or trimmed, his head. (TA.) And الَّذِى<br>\
كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقَهُ ↓ أَحْسَنَ [Who hath made good, or<br>\
goodly, everything that He hath created], in the<br>\
Kur [xxxii. 6], means حَسَّنَ خَلْقَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ [hath<br>\
made good, or goodly, the creation of everything].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [See also تَحْسِينٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And see 10.<br>\
3<br>\
إنِّى أُحَاسِنُ بِكَ النَّاسَ (S, TA) Verily I contend with men for thy superiority in حُسْن [i. e.<br>\
goodness, or goodliness, &amp;c.]. (TA.) [حَاسَنَ followed by an accus. is rendered by Golius, as on<br>\
the authority of J, who gives no explanation of<br>\
it, “Bene tractavit et egit. ”]<br>\
4<br>\
احسن as an intrans. v.: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He<br>\
did that which was حَسَن [meaning good, comely,<br>\
or pleasing; he acted well]; (Msb;) he did a<br>\
good deed: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [for] إِحْسَانٌ is the<br>\
contr. of إِسَآءَةٌ: (K:) it differs from إِنْعَامٌ in being to oneself and to another; whereas the latter<br>\
is only to another: (TA:) and it surpasses عَدْلٌ,<br>\
inasmuch as it means the giving more than one<br>\
owes, and taking less than is owed to one; whereas<br>\
the latter means the giving what one owes, and<br>\
taking what is owed to one. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
You say, أَحْسَنْتُ إِلَيْهِ and بِهِ [I acted, or behaved,<br>\
with goodness, well, or in a good or comely or<br>\
pleasing manner, towards him; did good to him;<br>\
benefited him; conferred a benefit, or benefits,<br>\
upon him]: both signify the same: (S, TA:)<br>\
and hence, in the Kur [xii. 101], قَدْ أَحْسَنَ بِى<br>\
إِذَ أَخْرَجَنِى مِنَ السِّجْنِ meaning إِلَىَّ [i. e. He hath<br>\
acted well towards me, when he brought me forth<br>\
from the prison]: (AHeyth, Az:) or, accord. to<br>\
some, the verb in this case is made to import the<br>\
meaning of لَطَفَ [which is trans. by means of<br>\
بِ, i. e. He hath acted graciously with me].<br>\
(Mughnee in art. بِ.) ―<br>\
-b3-  الإِحْسَانُ is also explained<br>\
as meaning الإِخْلَاصُ [i. e. The being sincere, or<br>\
without hypocrisy; or the asserting oneself to be<br>\
clear of believing in any beside God]; which is<br>\
a condition of the soundness, or validity, of<br>\
الإِيمَان and الإِسْلَام together: and as denoting<br>\
watchfulness, and good obedience: and as meaning<br>\
the continuing in the right way, and following<br>\
the way which those [of the righteous] who have<br>\
gone before have trodden; this last being said to<br>\
be the meaning in the Kur ix. 101. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
As a trans. v.: see 2, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  احسنهُ<br>\
also signifies (tropical:)  He knew it: (S, K, TA:) [or] he<br>\
knew it well; (Er-Rághib, Msb;) and so احسن بِهِ,<br>\
as in the saying, هُوَ يُحْسِنُ بِالعَرَبِيَّةِ (assumed tropical:)  He knows<br>\
well the Arabic language. (MA.) Hence the saying of &#39;Alee, قِيمَةُ المَرْءِ مَا يُحْسِنُهُ (tropical:)  [The value of<br>\
the man is what he knows, or knows well]. (TA.)<br>\
النَّاسُ أَبْنَآءُ مَا يُحْسِنُونَ is another saying of &#39;Alee,<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  Men are named, or reputed, in relation<br>\
to what they know, and to the good deeds that<br>\
they do. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَحْسِنْ بِهِ and مَا أَحْسَنَهُ: see<br>\
1, last sentence. You say also, ↓ مَا أُحَيْسِنَهُ [i. e.<br>\
How very good, or goodly, &amp;c., is he!]; using<br>\
the dim. form; like مَا أُمَيْلِحَهُ [q. v.]. (S and K<br>\
in art. ملح.)<br>\
-A3-  Also He (a man, IAar) sat upon<br>\
a high hill, or heap, of sand, such as is termed<br>\
حَسَنٌ. (IAar, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تحسّن: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also i. q. تَجَمَّلَ [i. e. He<br>\
beautified, embellished, or adorned, himself: and<br>\
he affected what is beautiful, goodly, or comely,<br>\
in person, or in action or actions or behaviour, or<br>\
in moral character, &amp;c.]. (TA.) [تَحَسَّنَتْ, said<br>\
of a woman, occurs, in the former sense, in the S<br>\
and K in art. رعد, and in the TA in art. نقط, &amp;c.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  دَخَلَ الحَمَّامَ فَتَحَسَّنَ He entered the hot bath<br>\
and was shaven. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تحاسن [He affected to be حَسَن (i. e. good,<br>\
goodly, beautiful, comely, &amp;c.), not being really<br>\
so]. (A in art. صبح. [See 6 in that art.])<br>\
10<br>\
استحسنهُ He counted, accounted, reckoned,<br>\
or esteemed, him, or it, حَسَن [i. e. good, goodly,<br>\
beautiful, comely, pleasing, &amp;c.; he approved,<br>\
thought well of, or liked, him, or it]; (S, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ حسّنهُ, inf. n. تَحْسِينٌ. (Har p. 594.) Hence<br>\
the saying, صَرْفُ هٰذَا اسْتِحْسَانٌ وَ المَنْعُ قِيَاسٌ [The<br>\
making this word perfectly declinable is approvable, but the making it imperfectly declinable is<br>\
agreeable with analogy]. (TA.)<br>\
حُسْنٌ (S, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ حُسُنٌ, which is of the<br>\
dial. of El-Hijáz, and ↓ حَسَنٌ, (MF, TA,) Goodness, or goodliness, [generally the latter,] beauty,<br>\
comeliness, or pleasingness; contr. of قُبْحٌ: (S:)<br>\
i. q. جَمَالٌ: (K:) but accord. to As, [when relating to the person,] حُسْنٌ is in the eyes, and<br>\
جَمَالٌ is in the nose: (TA:) symmetry; or just<br>\
proportion of the several parts of the person, one<br>\
to another: (Kull:) or anything, moving the<br>\
mind, that is desired, or wished for; such as is<br>\
approved by the intellect; and such as is approved<br>\
by natural desire; and such as is approved by<br>\
the faculty of sense: in the common conventional<br>\
language, mostly applied to what is approved by<br>\
the sight: in the Kur, mostly to what is approved<br>\
by mental perception: it is in accidents as well as<br>\
in substances: (Er-Rághib, TA:) the pl. is<br>\
↓ مَحَاسِنُ, (S, K,) like مَلَامِحُ pl. of لَمْحَةٌ, and<br>\
مَشَابِهُ pl. of شَبَهٌ, &amp;c., (Har p. 9,) contr. to rule,<br>\
(S, K,) as though pl. of ↓ مَحْسَنٌ or ↓ مُحْسَنٌ:<br>\
(S accord. to different copies:) or, accord. to Lh<br>\
and Eth-Tha&#39;álibee, مَحَاسِنُ has no proper sing.<br>\
(TA.) وَ قُولُوا لِلنَّاسِ حُسْنًا, in the Kur [ii. 77],<br>\
means And say ye to men a saying having in it<br>\
goodness (قَوْلًا ذَا حُسْنٍ): or حُسْنًا may mean حَسَنًا:<br>\
(Zj, TA:) and some read here حَسَنًا: and some,<br>\
حُسُنًا, accord. to the dial. of El-Hijáz: and some,<br>\
↓ حُسْنَى, as an inf. n., like بُشْرَى: (Bd:) but<br>\
AHát and Zj disallow this; the former saying<br>\
that حُسْنَى is like فُعْلَى [as fem. of أَفْعَلُ denoting<br>\
the comparative and superlative degrees], and<br>\
therefore should have the article ال. (TA.)<br>\
وَ وَصَّيْنَا الإِنْسَانَ بِوَالِدَيْهِ حُسْنًا, in the Kur [xxix. 7],<br>\
means [in like manner] And we have enjoined<br>\
man to do to his two parents what is good (مَا<br>\
يَحْسُنُ حُسْنًا): (TA:) and here [also] some read<br>\
حَسَنًا; and some, إِحْسَانًا. (Bd.) [See another ex.<br>\
of a similar kind, from the Kur xviii. 85, voce<br>\
إِمَّا, near the beginning of the paragraph.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
سِتُّ الحُسْنِ [The convolvulus caïricus of Linn.;<br>\
abundant in the gardens of Cairo;] a certain<br>\
plant that twines about trees and has a beautiful<br>\
flower. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also حَسَنٌ.<br>\
حَسَنٌ Having, or possessing, the quality termed<br>\
حُسْنٌ [which see above; good, or goodly, (generally the latter,) beautiful, comely, pleasing or<br>\
pleasant, &amp;c.]; (Msb, K, TA;) either intrinsically, as when applied to belief in God and in his<br>\
attributes; or extrinsically, as when applied to war<br>\
against unbelievers, for this is not good in itself: said<br>\
to be the only epithet of its measure except بَطَلٌ:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ حَسِينٌ signifies the same, (IB, K,)<br>\
because from حَسُنَ, like عَظِيمٌ and كَريِمٌ from<br>\
عَظُمَ and كَرُمَ, (IB, TA,) and ↓ حُسَانٌ, (K,) but<br>\
this is an intensive epithet, [signifying very good or<br>\
goodly &amp;c.,] (IB, TA,) and ↓ حُسَّانٌ, (K,) also an<br>\
intensive epithet, (S, IB,) and ↓ حَاسِنٌ, (K,) [properly signifying being, or becoming, good or goodly<br>\
&amp;c.,] cited by Lh as used in a future sense, (TA,)<br>\
and ↓ مُحَسَّنٌ as applied to a face: (K:) the fem.<br>\
is حَسَنَةٌ, and ↓ حَسْنَآءُ, applied to a woman, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) though the corresponding masc. of this<br>\
latter, namely, ↓ أَحْسَنُ, is [said to be] not used (S,<br>\
K) as applied to a man [in the sense of حَسَنٌ],<br>\
(S,) [but the phrase هُوَ أَحْسَنُهُمْ وَجْهًا as meaning<br>\
حَسَنُهُمْ وَجْهًا is mentioned in the S in art. بيض,<br>\
(see بَيَاضٌ, and see also the pl. أَحَاسِنُ in what<br>\
here follows,)] and ↓ حُسَّانَةٌ: (S, K:) the pl. masc.<br>\
is حِسَانٌ, (Msb, K,) pl. of حَسَنٌ used as an epithet; but when حَسَنٌ is used as a [proper] name,<br>\
its pl. is حَسَنُونَ; (Msb;) and حِسَانٌ may also<br>\
be pl. of حَسِينٌ; (TA;) and حُسَّانُونَ, (Sb, K,)<br>\
pl. of ↓ حُسَّانٌ, which has no broken pl.: (Sb:)<br>\
and أَحَاسِنُ القَوْمِ means حِسَانُهُمْ [the good, or<br>\
goodly, &amp;c., of the party, or company of men]:<br>\
(K:) the pl. fem. is حِسَانٌ, (K,) like the masc.,<br>\
pl. of حَسْنَآءُ, and the only instance of its kind except عِجَافٌ, pl. of عَجْفَآءُ. (TA.) You say رَجُلٌ<br>\
حَسَنٌ بَسَنٌ [A man very good or goodly &amp;c.],<br>\
using بسن as an imitative sequent [for the purpose<br>\
of corroboration]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [حَدِيثٌ حَسَنٌ A tradition of good authority; generally applied to one<br>\
transmitted in the first instance by two or more<br>\
relaters. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also meaning Good, comely, goodhumoured, pleasing, or pleasant, discourse or<br>\
talk.] ―<br>\
-b4-  الحَسَنُ The bone that is next to the<br>\
elbow; as also ↓ الحُسْنُ: (K:) or the extremity<br>\
of the bone of the upper half of the arm next the<br>\
shoulder-joint, because of the abundance of flesh<br>\
that is upon it; the extremity of that bone next<br>\
the elbow being called القَبِيحُ: (TA in art. قبح:)<br>\
or the upper part of that bone; the lower part<br>\
thereof being called القبيح. (Fr, TA in that art.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  A kind of tree, of beautiful appearance, (K,<br>\
TA,) also called the أَلآء, that grows in rows upon<br>\
a hill, or heap, (كَثِيب,) of sand; so called because of its beauty; whence the كثيب is called<br>\
نَقَا الحَسَنِ: thus described by Az, on the authority<br>\
of &#39;Alee Ibn-Hamzeh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [And hence,<br>\
perhaps,] حَسَنٌ signifies also A high كَثِيب [or<br>\
hill, or heap, of sand]: (IAar, K:) whence it is<br>\
used as a [proper] name of a boy. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also حُسْنٌ, first sentence.<br>\
الحُسَنُ: see أَحْسَنُ.<br>\
حُسُنٌ: see حُسْنٌ, first sentence.<br>\
حِسْنَةٌ A ledge (رَيْدٌ) projecting from a mountain: pl. حِسَنٌ. (K.)<br>\
حَسَنَةٌ fem. of حَسَنٌ [q. v.]. (S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, [used as a subst., or as an epithet in which<br>\
the quality of a subst. is predominant, A good<br>\
act or action;] an act of obedience [to God;<br>\
often particularly applied to an alms-deed]: (Ksh<br>\
and Bd in iv. 80:) and the reward [of a good<br>\
action]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) a good, benefit, benefaction, boon, or blessing: (Ksh and Bd ibid.:)<br>\
contr. of سَيِّئَةٌ [in all these senses]: (S, K:) as<br>\
contr. of this latter word, it signifies any rejoicing,<br>\
or gladdening, good or benefit &amp;c. that betides a<br>\
man in his soul and his body and his circumstances: (Er-Rághib, TA:) pl. حَسَنَاتٌ: (K, and<br>\
Kur vii. 167, &amp;c.:) it has no broken pl. (TA.)<br>\
Hence, in the Kur iv. 80, it means Abundance of<br>\
herbage, or of the goods, conveniences, and comforts, of life; ampleness of circumstances; and<br>\
success: and سَيِّئَة there means the contr. of these.<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA.) In the Kur xi. 116, الحَسَنَات<br>\
is said to mean The five daily prayers, as expiating what has been between them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
As an epithet, [fem. of حَسَنٌ,] it is applied to<br>\
an accident as well as to a substance. (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
حُسْنَى: see حُسْنٌ, and أَحْسَنُ; the latter, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
حَسْنَآءُ: see حَسَنٌ.<br>\
حُسَانٌ: see حَسَنٌ.<br>\
حَسِينٌ: see حَسَنٌ.<br>\
حُسَيْنٌ [dim. of حَسَنٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also] A high mountain: whence it is used as a [proper] name of a<br>\
boy. (TA.)<br>\
حُسَيْنَى One&#39;s utmost, [or rather one&#39;s best,]<br>\
or the utmost of one&#39;s power or ability or deed or<br>\
case: so in the saying, حُسَيْنَاهُ أَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا<br>\
[His utmost, or best, &amp;c., is, or will be, the doing<br>\
such a thing]: and ↓ حُسَيْنَاؤُهُ means the same.<br>\
(K, * TA.)<br>\
حُسَيْنَآءُ: see what next precedes.<br>\
-A2-  Also A<br>\
kind of tree, with small leaves. (K.)<br>\
حُسَّانٌ; and its fem., with ة: see حَسَنٌ, in<br>\

-b2-  [Hence,] الحَاسِنُ The<br>\
moon. (AA, S.)<br>\
أَحْسَنُ, fem. حَسْنَآءُ, pl. أَحَاسِنُ: see حَسَنٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
الأَحْسَنُ denotes the comparative and superlative<br>\
degrees [of حُسْنٌ]; as in the phrase هُوَ الأَحْسَنُ<br>\
[He, or it, is the better, and best; or the more,<br>\
and most, goodly or beautiful or comely &amp;c.]:<br>\
(K:) ↓ الحُسْنَى is the fem.; as in the phrase<br>\
الأَسْمَآءُ الحُسْنَى The best names; those of God;<br>\
which are ninety and nine: (Jel in vii. 179:)<br>\
it signifies the contr. of السُّوْءَى: (S, K:) the pl.<br>\
of الأَحْسَنُ is الأَحَاسِنُ. (K.) In the saying, in<br>\
the Kur [vi. 153 and xvii. 36], وَ لَا تَقْرَبُوا مَالَ اليَتِيمِ<br>\
إِلَّا بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ [And approach ye not the<br>\
property of the orphan, to make use of it,] except<br>\
by that act which is best to be done with it, the<br>\
meaning is, such an act as the taking care of it,<br>\
and increasing it: (Bd:) or, as some say, the<br>\
meaning is, the taking, of his property, what will<br>\
[suffice to] conceal those parts of one&#39;s person<br>\
that should not be exposed, and stay one&#39;s hunger.<br>\
(TA.) [The fem.] ↓ الحُسْنَى is applied to accidents only: not to substances. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
It means also, [as an epithet in which the quality<br>\
of a subst. predominates, That which is better,<br>\
and that which is best. And hence,] The good<br>\
final or ultimate state or condition [appointed<br>\
for the faithful]: (K:) so, it is said, in the Kur<br>\
xli. 50. (TA.) And The view, or vision, of God;<br>\
(K;) accord. to some: but it is said that in the Kur<br>\
x. 27, it means Paradise; and زِيَادَةٌ, which there<br>\
follows it, means the view, or vision, of the face<br>\
of God. (TA.) And Victory: and martyrdom:<br>\
(Th, K:) whence, [in the Kur ix. 52,] إِحْدَى<br>\
الحُسْنَيَيْنِ [one of the two best things]; (K;)<br>\
victory or martyrdom. (Ksh, Bd, Jel.) And<br>\
The saying لَا إِلَاهَ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ. (Jel in xcii. 6 and 9.)<br>\
The pl. of ↓ الحُسْنَى is الحُسْنَيَاتُ and ↓ الحُسَنُ,<br>\
(K, [the latter like رُجَعٌ pl. of رُجْعَى, but misunderstood by Freytag as syn. with المَحَاسِنُ,<br>\
which next follows it in the K,]) neither of which<br>\
is used without the article ال. (TA.)<br>\
مَا أُحَيْسِنَهُ: see 4, last sentence but one.<br>\
تَحْسِينٌ a subst. of the measure تَفْعِيلٌ; (K;)<br>\
or rather an inf. n. used as a subst.; (TA;) pl.<br>\
تَحَاسِينُ: whence كِتَابُ التَّحَاسِينِ (K) [Caligraphy; or] deliberate, orderly, and regular<br>\
writing; (TK;) [or close and compact writing,<br>\
without spaces, or gaps, and without elongation<br>\
of the letters;] contr. of المَشْقُ. (K. [See<br>\
كِتَابُ مَشْقٍ.])<br>\
مَحْسَنٌ: see حُسْنٌ, and مَحَاسِنُ.<br>\
مُحْسَنٌ: see حُسْنٌ.<br>\
مُحْسِنٌ Doing, or who does, that which is<br>\
حَسَن [meaning good, comely, or pleasing]; (K,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ مِحْسَانٌ: (K:) or the latter [is<br>\
an intensive epithet, meaning doing, or who does,<br>\
much that is good, comely, or pleasing: or]<br>\
means constantly doing that which is حَسَن.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  إِنَّا نَرَاكَ مِنَ المُحْسِنِينَ, in the Kur<br>\
xii. 36, means (tropical:)  Verily we see thee to be of those<br>\
who know, or know well, the interpretation of<br>\
dreams: (Ksh, Bd, TA: *) or (assumed tropical:)  of those endowed<br>\
with knowledge: or of the doers of good to the<br>\
prisoners: (Ksh, Bd:) or of those who aid the<br>\
weak and the sufferer of wrong, and visit the<br>\
sick. (TA.)<br>\
مَحْسَنَةٌ [A cause of good: pl., app., ↓ مَحَاسِنُ;<br>\
like as مَسَاوٍ, originally مَسَاوِئُ, is said to be pl.<br>\
of مَسَآءَةٌ, originally مَسْوَأَةٌ]. You say, هٰذَا الطَّعَامُ<br>\
مَحْسَنَةٌ لِلْجِسْمِ [This food is a cause of good,<br>\
i. e. beneficial, to the body]. (S.)<br>\
مُحَسَّنٌ: see حَسَنٌ.<br>\
مِحْسَانٌ: see مُحْسِنٌ.<br>\
مَحَاسِنُ The beautiful places [or parts] of the<br>\
body: (K:) accord. to some, (TA,) the sing.<br>\
is ↓ مَحْسَنٌ: or it has no sing.: (K:) the former<br>\
opinion is disapproved by ISd.: the latter is the<br>\
opinion of the grammarians and of the generality<br>\
of the lexicologists: and therefore, says Sb, the<br>\
rel. n. is ↓ مَحَاسِنِىٌّ; for if مَحَاسِنُ had a sing.,<br>\
