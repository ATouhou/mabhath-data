حَضِرَ, (AA, Kh, Lth, Fr, S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor. as<br>\
above, (Kh, Lth, Fr, Az, S, Msb, &amp;c.,) not<br>\
حَضَرَ, as<br>\
is implied in the K; but the latter form of the<br>\
pret. is disallowed by some; (MF;) and, with its<br>\
aor., is an instance of the intermixture of dialects;<br>\
(Msb;) and is like فَضِلَ, aor.<br>\
حَضُرَ, and نَعِمَ, aor.<br>\
حَضُرَ;<br>\
which are said by IKoot to be the only instances<br>\
of the kind; (MF;) inf. n. حُضُورٌ (S, Msb, K)<br>\

غَابَ: (S, K:) he came after having been absent.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  حَضَرَتِ الصَّلَاةُ, (Lth, A, L, Msb,) and,<br>\
as the people of El-Medeeneh say, حَضِرَت, but all<br>\
say تَحْضُرُ, (Lth, L,) originally حَضَرَ وَقْتُ الصَّلَاةِ,<br>\

One says, حَضَرَتِ القَاضِىَ امْرَأَةٌ, (Az,) and حَضِرَت,<br>\
(Fr, S,) and حَضِرَ, in which the ت is elided because القاضى intervenes between the verb and<br>\
امرأة, (Sh,) but the first is the most approved,<br>\
(Az,) [A woman came into the presence of, or<br>\
presented herself before, or came to, the judge.]<br>\

in a region, district, or tract, of cities, towns, or<br>\
villages, and of cultivated land; (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
[as also ↓ تحضّر: or this latter signifies he became<br>\
an inhabitant of such a region, district, or tract:]<br>\

my knee to his knee, each of us sitting upon his<br>\
knees, in contending or disputing, (جَاثَيْتُهُ, S, K, *)<br>\

مُكَابَرَةٌ [which seems to be the right reading].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And حاضرهُ بِكَذَا He disputed, debated,<br>\

present with him, to attend him, to come into his<br>\
presence, or to come to him; or he brought him,<br>\
or it, to him. (K.) And طَلَبْتُ فُلَانًا فَأَحْضَرَنِيهِ<br>\

following phrases]. (MF.) You say, كَلَّمْتُهُ<br>\

(K, * TA,) and ↓ حُضْرَتِهِ and ↓ حضْرَتَهَ (S, K) and<br>\
↓ حَضَرِهِ (Yaakoob, S, Msb, K) and ↓ حَضَرِتَهَ (K)<br>\
and ↓ مَحْضَرِهِ, (S, A, Msb, K,) all syn. expressions, (K,) meaning (tropical:)  [I spoke to him, and that<br>\

and taint it.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also applied as a title, by<br>\
writers of letters and the like, to any great man<br>\

(tropical:)  [The exalted object of resort commands such a<br>\
thing]. (MF.) [It is similar to الجَنَابُ; but is<br>\

than the latter. It is often prefixed to the name<br>\

a one: and حَضْرَتُكَ (tropical:)  The object of resort, thyself.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  The vicinity of a thing, (T, A,)<br>\
and of a man. (S. [So accord. to two copies of<br>\

see what follows.]) You say, كُنْتُ بِحَضْرَةِ الدَّارِ<br>\
(tropical:)  I was in the vicinity of, or near to, the house.<br>\

-b4-  Also<br>\
The فِنَآء of a رَجُل. (S. [So accord. to two copies<br>\
of the S; where it is said, حَضْرَةُ الرَّجُلِ قُرْبُهُ وَفِنَاؤُهُ:<br>\
but the right reading is evidently الرَّحْلِ: so that<br>\
the second of the two meanings thus explained is,<br>\
The court, or yard, in front, or extending from<br>\
the sides, of a house, or an abode.])<br>\
-A2-  And (tropical:)  Apparatus for building, such as baked bricks, and<br>\
gypsum-plaster: so in the saying, جَمَعَ الحَضْرَةَ<br>\

حَضَارِ [an imperative verbal n.] Be thou present.<br>\
(A.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A certain star, (S, K,) upon the<br>\
right hoof of Centaurus: upon his other fore<br>\
leg is الوَزْنُ. (Kzw.) It is said, حَضَارِ وَالوَزْنُ<br>\
مُحْلِفَانِ [Hadári and El-Wezn are two causes<br>\
of swearing]: they are two stars that rise before<br>\
Canopus (Suheyl); and when either of them<br>\
rises, it is thought to be Canopus, because of<br>\
their resemblance to it: (AA, S: *) they are<br>\
termed محلفان because of the disagreement of<br>\
their beholders when they rise; one swearing<br>\
that the one rising is Canopus, and another<br>\
swearing that it is not. (AA, TA.) Th says<br>\
that it is a dim, distant, star; and cites this<br>\
verse:<br>\
أَرَي نَارَ لَيْلَى بَالعَقِيقِ كَأَنَّهَا<br>\
حَضَارِ إِذَا مَا أَعْرَضَتْ وَفُرُودُهَا<br>\
I see the fire of Leylà, in El-&#39;Akeek, dim in the<br>\
distance, as though it were Hadári, when it<br>\
appears, with its Furood, which are dim stars<br>\
around Hadári. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  حَضَارٌ: see what next<br>\
follows.<br>\
حِضَارٌ (S, K) and ↓ حَضَارٌ (K) White: (Sh, T:)<br>\
or excellent and white: (S, K:) or red: (K:)<br>\
but this requires consideration: (TA:) applied<br>\
to camels, and to a single camel: (S, K:) or<br>\
having no sing. (K.) And the former, A she-camel combining strength with excellence of pace:<br>\
(El-Umawee, T, S, K:) but Sh says that he had<br>\
not heard it used in this sense; and that it only<br>\
signifies “ white,” as applied to camels. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also حُضْرٌ.<br>\
حَضِيرٌ (tropical:)  One who always forms right opinions,<br>\
or judgments, respecting things, or affairs. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  See also حَضِيرَةٌ, in three places.<br>\
حَضَارَةٌ and حِضَارَةٌ: see حَضَرٌ.<br>\
حَضِيرَةٌ The collective body of a people: (Fr,<br>\
K:) so in the following ex., (Fr,) from a poem<br>\
of Selmà El-Juhaneeyeh, in which she bewails<br>\
the death of her brother As&#39;ad, and celebrates<br>\
his praises: (S:)<br>\
يَرِدُ المِيَاهَ حَضِيرَةً وَنَفِيضَةً<br>\
نفيضة signifying the same: (Fr:) [so that the<br>\
meaning is, Coming to the waters in a collective and congregated body:] or the former signifies waters by which people are dwelling, or<br>\
staying; and the latter, “by which there is not<br>\
any one: ” (IAar, Sh:) or the former, people<br>\
dwelling, or staying, by the waters; and the<br>\
latter, men “ going before an army as scouts,<br>\
or explorers: ” (As:) but what IAar says, mentioned above, is better: (Az:) or the former, a<br>\
company of seven, or eight, men; and the latter,<br>\
“ one; ” and also men “ who explore a place<br>\
thoroughly: ” (A&#39;Obeyd:) or the former, a company of four, or five, men, (S, K,) engaged in a<br>\
warring and plundering expedition: (S:) or<br>\
seven: (TA:) or eight: or nine: (K: in some<br>\
copies of the K “ seven; ” but the former is the<br>\
right reading: TA:) or ten: or a company of<br>\
men not more than ten (نَفَرٌ) with whom one goes<br>\
on a warring and plundering expedition: (K:)<br>\
or, accord. to AAF and the M and K, the foremost, or preceding, portion of an army: and<br>\
accord. to IB, نفيضة signifies “ a party sent to<br>\
a place to discover whether there be there an<br>\
enemy or any cause of fear: ” (TA:) pl. حَضَائِرُ.<br>\
(S.)<br>\
-A2-  A place where dates are dried: (ElBáhilee, ISk, Az, Mgh, Msb, K:) because frequented: pl. as above. (Mgh.) [See also حَصِيرَةٌ<br>\

You say, أَلْقَتِ الشَّاةُ حَضِيرَتَهَا The ewe, or she-goat, ejected her سُخْد and water and blood, after<br>\
having brought forth. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And What a woman<br>\
emits after childbirth and [after] the stopping<br>\
of her blood: and ↓ حَضِيرٌ is its pl. [or a coll.<br>\
gen. n.]. (K. [Or, accord. to some copies of<br>\
the K, and the TA, The stopping of her blood,<br>\
or its ceasing to flow, is a signification distinct<br>\
from what precedes it.)] ―<br>\
-b4-  And What a she-camel emits after bringing forth: or, accord.<br>\
to AO, the membrane that envelops the fœtus.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (K, TA, [in the CK “ or ”]) ↓ the<br>\
latter signifies Thick blood which collects in the<br>\
membrane that encloses the fœtus. (K, * TA.)<br>\
حَاضِرٌ A man present: (A, K:) pl. [حَاضِرُونَ<br>\
and] حُضَّرٌ and [more commonly] حُضُورٌ, (S, K,)<br>\

say, فَعَلْتُهُ وَفُلَانٌ حَاضِرٌ I did it such a one being<br>\
present. (A.) And هَوَ مِنْ حَاضِرِى المَلِكِ [He<br>\

الصَّلَاةُ حَاضِرَةٌ, for وَقْتُهَا حَاضِرٌ, (tropical:)  The time of prayer<br>\
is come. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Also (assumed tropical:)  Ready, or prepared:<br>\

in modern Arabic. See 4.] You say, قُولُوا مَا<br>\
هُوَ حَاضِرٌ عِنْدَكُمْ (assumed tropical:)  Say ye what is ready with<br>\
you [or in your minds]. (TA.) And هُوَ حَاضِرٌ<br>\
بِالجَوَابِ (tropical:)  [He is ready with the answer, or reply];<br>\
and بِالنَّوَادِرِ (tropical:)  [with rare words or expressions];<br>\

alone, signifies a man having the quality of perspicuity of speech, and intelligence; syn. ذُو البَيَانِ<br>\
وَالفِقْهِ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  A visiting angel: and ↓ حَاضِرَةٌ is<br>\
