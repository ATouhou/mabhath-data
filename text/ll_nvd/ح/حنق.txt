-b2-  [Hence,] لَا يَحْنَقُ عَلَى<br>\
جِرَّتِهِ: and ما يحنق على جِرَّةٍ: [thus written in<br>\
the TA; though it seems to be implied by the<br>\
manner in which the two sayings are there introduced, in this art., that the verb in each case<br>\

assigned to it below:] see جِرَّةٌ.<br>\

horses; as though they imagined the sing. to<br>\
be مِحْنَاقٌ: (ISd, TA:) or the sing., applied to a<br>\
horse, (A,) and to an ass, (TA,) lean, &amp;c., as<br>\
above, so that the belly cleaves to the back: and<br>\
so the pls. مَحَانِقُ and مَحَانِيقُ applied to horses:<br>\
(A, TA:) or مَحَانِيقُ signifies fat; as also حُنُقٌ<br>\
[pl. of ↓ حَنِيقٌ]; (K, TA;) both applied to camels.<br>\
