حَتَفَ, aor.<br>\
حَتِفَ, is a verb mentioned by IKoot<br>\
and IKtt and others, as derived from حَتْفٌ signifying “ death,” though J says that no verb<br>\
is formed from this word; as IF and Meyd and<br>\
Az also assert: (MF, TA:) and حُتُوفٌ is its<br>\
inf. n., as well as pl. of حَتْفٌ: [accord. to SM,<br>\
it is intrans., signifying He died; for he says,]<br>\
hence the saying in the A, المَرْءُ يَسْعَى وَيَطُوفُ<br>\
وَعَاقِبَتُهُ الحُتُوفُ [Man labours, and goes about:<br>\
and his end is dying]. (TA.) [But see what<br>\
follows.]<br>\
-A2-  IF says that no verb is formed from<br>\
حَتْفٌ signifying “ death; ” and so, after him, J;<br>\
and Az says that he had heard no such verb:<br>\
but IKoot mentions حَتَفَهُ, aor.<br>\
حَتِفَ, inf. n. حَتْفٌ, as<br>\
signifying He, or it, killed him; or caused him<br>\
to die. (Msb.)<br>\
حَتْفٌ Death: (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.:) pl. حُتُوفٌ.<br>\
(S, K.) You say, مَاتَ حَتْفَ أَنْفِهِ, (A &#39;Obeyd, S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) and حَتْفَ فِيهِ, but this is rare,<br>\
and حَتْفَ أَنْفَيْهِ, (K,) which may mean مَنْخِرَيْهِ,<br>\
or it may mean أَنْفه وَفَمه, the انف being made<br>\
predominant, (TA,) He died upon his bed;<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, Mgh, Msb, K;) [a natural death;]<br>\
respiring until he yielded his last breath; (Msb;)<br>\
not from slaughter, nor beating, (A &#39;Obeyd, S,<br>\
Msb, K,) nor drowning, nor burning, (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
Sgh, Msb, K,) nor by a wild beast, &amp;c.: (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
TA:) the nose is particularized as meaning that<br>\
the spirit passes forth from it with the breath;<br>\
or because they imagined that the spirit of the<br>\
sick man passes forth from his nose, and that of<br>\
the wounded man from his wound; (IAth, K;)<br>\
or because the spirit passes forth from the mouth<br>\
and the nose, and the latter of these is made<br>\
predominant: (O, TA:) and حتف is put in the<br>\
accus. case in the manner of an inf. n. (TA.)<br>\
This phrase was used in the time of paganism,<br>\
by Es-Semow-al: (Msb, TA:) or, accord. to<br>\
some, in the phrase attributed to him, the right<br>\
reading is not مات حتف انفه, but مات فِى فِرَاشِهِ;<br>\
and the former was first used by Mohammad.<br>\
(Ham p. 52.) It is said of a human being: (S,<br>\
Mgh:) and then of any animal when it dies<br>\
without any accidental cause: (Mgh:) hence, of<br>\
a fish that has died, and floats upon the water.<br>\
(Msb, TA.) It is said in a trad. of &#39;Ámir Ibn-Fuheyreh,<br>\
وَالمَرْءُ يَأْتِى حَتْفُهُ مِنْ فَوْقِهِ<br>\
[And man, his death comes from above him]:<br>\
meaning that his caution and his cowardice will not<br>\
repel from him the decree of death when it befalls<br>\
him: originally said by &#39;Amr Ibn-Mámeh. (L,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  حَيَّةٌ حَتْفَةٌ [A dead serpent] is a phrase<br>\
like اِمْرَأَةٌ عَدْلَةٌ: (Z, TA:) the latter word is<br>\
here an epithet. (Z, K.)<br>\
