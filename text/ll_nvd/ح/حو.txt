حَوِىَ [originally حَوِوَ]: see what next follows.<br>\
9<br>\
اِحْوَوَى, (As, S, K,) [like اِرْعَوَى, originally<br>\
اِحْوَوَّ, of the measure اِفْعَلَّ, then اِحْوَوَوَ, and then<br>\
اِحْوَوَى,] aor. يَحْوَوِى, inf. n. اِحْوِوَآءٌ, said of a<br>\
horse, (As, S,) He was, or became, of the colour<br>\
termed حُوَّةٌ [q. v. infrà]; as also ↓ اِحْوَاوَى, (As,<br>\
S, K,) [originally اِحْوَاوَّ, of the measure اِفْعَالَّ,<br>\
then اِحْوَاوَوَ, and then اِحْوَاوَى,] aor. يَحْوَاوِى,<br>\
inf. n. اِحْوِيوَآءٌ, (As, S,) or, accord. to ISd, correctly, اِحْوِيَّآءٌ, because the ى changes the و [after<br>\
it] into ى, as it does in أَيَّامٌ [which is originally<br>\
أَيْوَامٌ]; (TA;) and ↓ اِحْوَوَّى, (ISd, K,) [accord.<br>\
to the pronunciation of the Koofees, as will be<br>\
seen below, originally اِحْوَوَّوَ,] said by IB to be<br>\
found thus written in some of the copies of the<br>\
book of As, [that entitled كِتَابُ الفَرَسِ,] but to be<br>\
a mistake, because it is agreed that there is not<br>\
in the language a verb ending with three letters<br>\
of the same kind except اِبْيَضَضَّ [for اِبْيَضَّ];<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ حَوِىَ, (As, S, K,) like رَضِىَ, (K,)<br>\
[originally حَوِوَ,] aor. يَحْوِى, inf. n. حُوَّةٌ, (As,<br>\
S,) or حَوًى; (K;) this last verb mentioned by<br>\
As as used by some of the Arabs. (S.) And<br>\
الأَرْضُ ↓ اِحْوَاوَتِ The land was, or became, green;<br>\
as also ↓ اِحْوَوَّت; (K;) [or the latter is correctly<br>\
اِحْوَوَت:] IJ says that ↓ اِحْوَاوَت is of the measure<br>\
اِفْعَالَّت, [originally اِحْوَاوَّت, then احْوَاوَوَت. and<br>\
then اِحْوَاوَت,] and that the Koofees say اِحْوَاوَّت<br>\
and ↓ اِحْوَوَّت; but ISd says that their usage is<br>\
wrong, for the Arabs say اِحْوَوَى, like اِرْعَوَى, and<br>\
do not say اِحْوَوَّ. (TA.)<br>\

اِحْوَاوَى: see 9; for each in three places.<br>\

اِحْوَوَّى: see 9; for each in three places.<br>\
حُوَّةٌ [A brown colour;] redness inclining to<br>\
blackness: (As, S, K:) or a colour intermixed<br>\
with [the blackish red termed] كُمْتَةٌ, like the rust<br>\
of iron: (S:) or blackness inclining to greenness.<br>\
(K.) In the lip, [The brownish colour termed]<br>\
سُمْرَةٌ; (S;) [i. e.] a colour resembling [that<br>\
termed] اللَّعَسُ and اللَّمَى: (T, TA:) or a blackness in the lips; which is approved. (Ham<br>\
p. 386.)<br>\
أَحْوَى Of the colour termed حُوَّةٌ [q. v. suprà]:<br>\
and also black: (K:) or black by reason of [intense] خُضْرَة [by which may be here meant either<br>\
greenness, or dark, or ashy, dust-colour]: (TA:)<br>\
applied to a horse, i. q. كُمَيْتٌ [i. e. bay] overspread with blackness; (TA;) or red in the back;<br>\
(En-Nadr, TA;) or more yellow than, but nearly<br>\
the same as, such as is termed أَحَمُّ, so that one<br>\
swears, of such a horse, that he is أَحَمّ: (AO,<br>\
TA: [see مُحْلِفٌ:]) applied to a camel, whose<br>\
خُضْرَة [here meaning dark, or ashy, dust-colour]<br>\
is intermixed with blackness and yellowness: (S:)<br>\
applied to a man, having [a brownish colour such<br>\
as is termed] سُمْرَةٌ in the lip; (S;) or having a<br>\
blackness in the lips, which is approved; (Ham<br>\
p. 386;) fem. حَوَّآءُ, applied to a woman, (S,) and<br>\
also to a lip (شَفَةٌ) as meaning red inclining to<br>\
blackness: (K:) applied to a plant, inclining to<br>\
blackness by reason of its intense greenness; (K;)<br>\
and such is the softest of plants: (TA:) the pl.<br>\
is حُوٌّ; occurring in a trad., in which the best<br>\
of horses are said to be those thus termed: (TA:)<br>\
the dim. of أَحْوَى is ↓ أُحَيْوٍ, in the dial. of him<br>\
who says أُسَيْوِدُ [instead of أُسَيِّدُ, dim. of أَسْوَدُ];<br>\
but there is a difference of opinion as to the form<br>\
with idghám: &#39;Eesà Ibn-&#39;Omar says ↓ أُحَىٌّ,<br>\
making it perfectly decl., which Sb pronounces<br>\
a mistake: &#39;Amr Ibn-El-&#39;Alà, or Aboo-&#39;Amr<br>\
Ibn-El-&#39;Alà, (accord. to different copies of the<br>\
S,) says ↓ أُحَىٍّ, after the manner of أُحَيْوٍ, which,<br>\
also, Sb disallows: Yoo says ↓ أُحَىُّ, and this,<br>\
says Sb, is the regular and right form. (S.)<br>\
[Hence,] بَكْرَةٌ حَوَّآءٌ A sheave of a pulley formed<br>\
of black wood. (TA.) And نَمْلٌ حُوٌّ Red ants;<br>\
called نَمْلُ سُلَيْمَانَ. (TA.) فَجَعَلَهُ غُثَآءً أَحْوَى,<br>\
in the Kur [lxxxvii. 5], means, accord. to Fr, And<br>\
hath made it (the herbage mentioned before)<br>\
dried up, black by reason of oldness: or it may<br>\
mean and hath made it to become غثآء [or decayed,<br>\
or dried-up, leaves and stalks,] after it has been<br>\
green. (TA.)<br>\
أَحْوِىٌّ rel. n. of أَحْوَى. (TA.)<br>\
أُحَىُّ and أُحَىٌّ and أُحَىٍّ: see أحْوَى.<br>\
أُحَيْوٍ: see أَحْوَى.<br>\
