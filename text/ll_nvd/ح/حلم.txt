حُلْمٌ and ↓ اِحْتِلَامٌ signify [The dreaming of]<br>\
copulation in sleep: (K:) and the verbs are<br>\

the hide that has become perforated and spoilt<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  And A dream, or vision in sleep; (S, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ حُلُمٌ: (K:) accord. to most of the lexicologists, as well as F, syn. with رُؤْيَا: or it is<br>\
specially such as is evil; and رؤيا is the contr.:<br>\
this is corroborated by the trad., الرُّؤْيَا مِنَ اللّٰهِ<br>\
وَالحُلْمُ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ [The رؤيا is from God, and<br>\
the حلم is from the Devil]: (MF:) and by the<br>\
phrase, in the Kur [xii. 44 and xxi. 5], أَضْغَاثُ<br>\
أَحْلَامٍ [The confused circumstances of dreams,<br>\
or of evil dreams]: but each is used in the place<br>\
of the other: (TA:) أَحْلَامٌ is the pl. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
أَحْلَامُ نَائِمٍ [lit. The dreams of a sleeper;] a<br>\
kind of thick cloths, or garments, (IKh, Z, TA,)<br>\
striped, of the people of El-Medeeneh. (Z, TA.)<br>\
حِلْمٌ [Forbearance; clemency;] the quality of<br>\

gravity; staidness; sedateness; calmness: syn.<br>\
أَنَاةٌ: (S, K:) or these qualities with power or<br>\
ability [to exercise the contrary qualities]; expl.<br>\
by أَنَاةٌ and سُكُونٌ with قُدْرَةٌ and قُوَّةٌ: (Kull<br>\
p. 167:) or the management of one&#39;s soul and<br>\
temper on the occasion of excitement of anger:<br>\
(TA:) or tranquillity on the occasion of emotion<br>\
of anger: or delay in requiting the wrongdoer:<br>\
(KT:) it is described by the term ثِقَلٌ, or gravity;<br>\
like as its contr. [سَفَهٌ] is described by the terms<br>\
خِقَّةٌ and عَجَلٌ, or levity, or lightness, and hastiness: (TA in art. رجح:) also (assumed tropical:)  intelligence;<br>\
(K;) which is not its proper signification, but a<br>\
meaning assigned because it is one of the results<br>\
of intelligence: and ↓ حَلْمٌ, with fet-h, is likewise said to have this last meaning; but this<br>\
requires consideration: (TA:) the former is one<br>\
of those inf. ns. that are [used as simple substs.,<br>\
and therefore] pluralized: (ISd, TA:) the pl.<br>\
[of pauc.] is أَحْلَامٌ and [of mult.] حُلُومٌ. (K.)<br>\
Hence, in the Kur [lii. 32], أَمْ تَأْمُرُهُمْ أَحْلَامُهُمْ<br>\
بِهٰذَا (K,) said to mean (assumed tropical:)  Do their understandings enjoin them this? (TA.) And أُولُو الأَحْلَامِ,<br>\
occurring in a trad., means (assumed tropical:)  Persons of understanding. (TA.)<br>\

spoilt and perforated by [the worms termed] حَلَم:<br>\
and ↓ حَلِيمٌ, [in like manner,] a hide, or skin,<br>\
spoilt by the حَلَم before it is stripped off. (TA.)<br>\
And عَنَاقٌ حَلِمَةٌ A she-kid whose skin has been<br>\
spoilt by the حَلَم; (K, * TA;) as also ↓ تَحْلِمَةٌ,<br>\
of which the pl. is تَحَالِمُ: (K:) the pl. of حَلِمَةٌ<br>\
is حِلَامٌ. (TA.)<br>\
حُلُمٌ: see حُلْمٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A [dream<br>\

He attained to puberty, or virility, in an absolute sense. (TA.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[xxiv. 58], وَإِذَا بَلَغَ الأَطْفَالُ مِنْكُمُ الحُلُمَ فَلْيَسْتَأْذِنُوا<br>\
[And when your children attain to puberty, or<br>\
virility, they shall ask permission to come into<br>\
your presence]. (TA.) [And hence,] أَضْرَاسُ<br>\
الحُلُمِ, (also called أَضْرَاسُ العَقْلِ, TA in art. ضرس,)<br>\
[The teeth of puberty, or wisdom-teeth,] so called<br>\
because they grow after the attaining to puberty,<br>\
and the completion of the intellectual faculties:<br>\
(S, L, Msb, all in art. نجذ:) they are four teeth<br>\
that come forth after the [other] teeth have become strong. (TA in art. ضرس.)<br>\
حَلَمَةٌ A small tick: (K:) or a large tick; (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) like عُلٌّ; (S;) and said to be<br>\
like the head [or nipple, when small,] of a woman&#39;s<br>\
breast: (Msb:) or a tick in the last stage of its<br>\
growth; for at first, when small, it is called<br>\
قَمْقَامَةٌ; then, حَمْنَانَةٌ; then, قُرَادٌ; and then,<br>\
حَلَمَةٌ: (As, TA:) the pl., (S,) or [rather] coll.<br>\
gen. n., (Mgh, Msb,) is ↓ حَلَمٌ. (S, Mgh, Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, as being likened thereto, (Mgh,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The head [or nipple, when small,] of a woman&#39;s<br>\

when the skin is tanned, the place thereof remains<br>\
thin: (S:) or a certain worm, incident to skin,<br>\
which it eats, so that, when the skin is tanned, the<br>\
place of the eating rends: pl. [or rather coll.<br>\
gen. n.] ↓ حَلَمٌ. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  And A species of plant;<br>\
(S, K;) accord. to As, also called يَنَمَةٌ: (S:) As<br>\
is also related to have said that it is a plant of the<br>\
kind termed عُشْب, having a dusty hue, a rough<br>\
feel, and a red flower: another says that it grows<br>\
in Nejd, in the sands, has a blossom, and roughish<br>\
leaves, and thorns resembling the nails of a man;<br>\
and that the camels suffer adhesion of the spleen<br>\
to the side, and their young are cast, [for وتزل<br>\
اخياكها (an evident mistranscription in the TA),<br>\
I read وَتزِلُّ أَحْبَالُها,] when they depasture it from<br>\
the dry branches: accord. to AHn, it is [a plant]<br>\
less than a cubit [in height], having a thick, or<br>\
rough, leaf, and branches, and a flower like that<br>\
of the anemone, except that it is larger, and<br>\
thicker, or rougher: accord. to the K, it signifies<br>\
also the tree [or plant] called سَعْدَان; which is<br>\
one of the most excellent kinds of pasture: but<br>\
Az says, it has nothing in common with the<br>\
سعدان, which is a herb having round [heads of]<br>\
prickles; whereas the حلمة has no prickles, but<br>\
is a well-known kind of جَنْبَة; and I have seen it:<br>\
(TA:) [Dmr, accord. to Golius, describes it as<br>\
“ a herb less than the arnoglossa ” (or arnoglossum),<br>\
“ whitening in the leaves, and downy. ”]<br>\
حَلِيمٌ Having حِلْم [i. e. forbearance, or clemency, &amp;c.; forbearing, or clement, &amp;c.]: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K:) pl. حُلَمَآءُ and أَحْلَامٌ. (K.) In the<br>\
Kur xi. 89, it is said to be used by way of scoffing<br>\
[or irony]. (TA.) الحَلِيمُ is one of the names of<br>\
God; meaning [The Forbearing, or Clement,<br>\
&amp;c.; or] He Whom the disobedience of the disobedient does not flurry, nor anger against them<br>\
disquiet, but Who has appointed to everything a<br>\
term to which it must finally come. (TA.) ―<br>\
