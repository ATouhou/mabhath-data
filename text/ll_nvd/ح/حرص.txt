حَرَصَهُ, aor. [<br>\
حَرِصَ and]<br>\
حَرُصَ, (TK,) inf. n. حَرْصٌ,<br>\
(T, S, K, &amp;c.,) He rent it; or clave it: (T, S,<br>\
K, &amp;c.:) and he, or it, stripped off, scraped off,<br>\
rubbed off, abraded, or otherwise removed, its<br>\
superficial part, peel, rind, or the like: (T, K,<br>\
&amp;c.:) the former, (Az,) or the latter, (Az, Er-Rághib, B,) is the primary signification. (TA.)<br>\
You say, حَرَصَ القَصَّارُ الثَّوْبَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
حَرِصَ (S, Msb, TA) and<br>\
حَرُصَ, (Msb,) inf. n. حَرْصٌ,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) The beater and washer and whitener<br>\
rent the garment, or piece of cloth, (A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA,) in beating it: (Mgh:) or made holes<br>\
in it by beating it: (S, TA: *) or made holes and<br>\
rents in it thereby: or abraded its superficial<br>\
part thereby. (TA.) And حُرِصَ المَرْعَى The<br>\
pasture, or herbage, became entirely consumed,<br>\
nothing of it being left; (IF, K;) as though it<br>\
were stripped off from the surface of the land.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  حَرَصَ عَلَيْهِ, (T, S, A, Msb, K, *) aor.<br>\
حَرِصَ<br>\
(T, S, Msb, K) and<br>\
حَرُصَ, mentioned by IKtt and<br>\
the author of the Iktitáf, (MF,) inf. n. حَرْصٌ;<br>\
(Msb;) and حَرِصَ, aor.<br>\
حَرَصَ, (T, Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
حَرَصٌ; (Msb; [but it seems to be indicated in<br>\
the K, by its being said that the pret. is like<br>\
سَمِعَ, that it is حَرْصٌ;]) the latter form of the<br>\
verb, however, is bad; (T, TA;) though El-<br>\
Kurtubee is asserted by MF to have said that the<br>\
former is of weak authority; which is clearly<br>\
wrong, as the readers of the Kur are generally<br>\
agreed in using it; (TA;) He desired it vehemently, eagerly, greedily, very greedily, or with<br>\
avidity; he hankered after it; he coveted it; he<br>\
desired it excessively, or inordinately: (S, * K, *<br>\
TA:) or he desired it culpably; namely, worldly<br>\
good: (Msb:) said by Az to be derived from<br>\
the first of the significations mentioned in this<br>\
art., or, as is also said by Er-Rághib, and<br>\
in the B, from the second thereof; because,<br>\
says Az, he who does so [may be said by a<br>\
figure of speech to be one who] scratches off<br>\
the outer skin of the faces of men by his so doing:<br>\
but MF regards this as improbable; and says<br>\
that most of the lexicologists hold the last to be<br>\
the primary signification, and others to be taken<br>\
from it: (TA:) حَرَصَ عَلَيْهِ, aor.<br>\
حَرِصَ, inf. n. حَرْصٌ,<br>\
also signifies he strove, or laboured; exerted<br>\
himself; took pains, or extraordinary pains; to<br>\
acquire, obtain, or attain, it: (Msb, TA: *) and<br>\
↓ احترص signifies the same as حَرَصَ [he desired<br>\
vehemently, &amp;c.]: (K:) and he strove, or laboured;<br>\
exerted himself; took pains, or extraordinary<br>\
pains; to acquire, obtain, or attain, a thing.<br>\
(AA, K, * TA.) You say, لَا حَرَسَ اللّٰهُ مَنْ حَرَصَ<br>\
[May God not guard him who desires inordinately, or culpably]. (A.) Aboo-Dhu-eyb makes<br>\
حَرَصْتُ trans. by means of بِ, in the following<br>\
verse:<br>\
وَلَقَدْ حَرَصْتُ بِأَنْ أُدَافِعَ عَنْهُمُ<br>\
فَإِذَا المَنِيَّةُ أَقْبَلَتْ لَا تُدْفَعُ<br>\
[And verily I had purposed to defend them by<br>\
repelling aggression from them; but lo, the decree<br>\
of death came: it was not to be repelled]: meaning, هَمَمْتُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also He was excessively<br>\
solicitous, or careful, and fearful, respecting him;<br>\
and excessively pitiful, or compassionate, to him.<br>\
See حِرْصٌ and حَرِيصٌ.]<br>\
3<br>\
حارص عَلَى الأَمْرِ He kept, or applied himself,<br>\
constantly, or perseveringly, to the thing, or affair.<br>\
(TA in art. حفظ.)<br>\
4<br>\
مَا أَحْرَصَكَ عَلَى الدُّنْيَا [How vehemently or<br>\
inordinately or culpably desirous art thou, or<br>\
how greedy or covetous art thou, of worldly<br>\
goods!] (A.)<br>\
5<br>\
إِنَّهُ لَيَتَحَرَّصُ غَدَآءَهُمْ وَعَشَآءَهُمْ Verily he<br>\
watches for the time of (يَتَحَيَّنُ) their morningmeal and their evening-meal: (K:) from حِرْصٌ<br>\
