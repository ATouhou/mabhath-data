حَرَضَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
حَرَضٌ, (Msb,) His stomach became in a corrupt,<br>\
or disordered, state: (K:) or he (a man) became<br>\
in a corrupt, or disordered, state, and sick, or<br>\
diseased, so as to defile himself in his clothes:<br>\
[see حَرَضٌ, below:] or he became emaciated (lit.<br>\
dissolved) by grief, or by excessive love: (S:) or<br>\
he became at the point of death: (Msb:) and<br>\
he suffered protracted disquietude of mind, and<br>\
disease; as also حَرُضَ, aor.<br>\
حَرُضَ: (K:) and حَرَضَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
حَرُضَ and<br>\
حَرِضَ, inf. n. حُرُوضٌ (K) and حَرْضٌ, (TA,)<br>\
he became heavily oppressed by disease; or constantly affected thereby so as to be at the point of<br>\
death: (K:) or this last form of the verb signifies<br>\
he died, or perished. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app.,]<br>\
حَرُضَ, and حَرَضَ, aor.<br>\
حَرُضَ, inf. n. حُرُوضٌ, as in<br>\
the L; not حَرِضَ, as in the K (assumed tropical:)  He was, or<br>\
became, low, base, mean, or sordid; unable to<br>\
rise from, or quit, his place; a signification given<br>\
in the K to حَرِضَ: or low, base, mean, or sordid;<br>\
possessing no good: (TA:) [but of the correctness<br>\
of one of the two forms here mentioned on the<br>\
authority of the L, the author of the TA expresses<br>\
a bout: app. with respect to the latter of them;<br>\
for it is said,] حَرُضَ, inf. n. حَرَاضَةٌ and حُرُوضَةٌ<br>\
and حُرُوضٌ, also signifies he (a man, TA) was, or<br>\
became, low, base, mean, or sordid, and bad, corrupt, or vicious, and neglected, or forsaken; (K,<br>\
TA;) as also حَرِضَ. (K: but only the former,<br>\
حَرُضَ, is given in this sense in the TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
حَرَضَ as a trans. v.: see 4, in two places.<br>\
-A3-<br>\
حَرِضَ, aor.<br>\
حَرَضَ, also signifies He picked up from<br>\
the ground إِحْرِيض [or safflower]. (O, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
حرّضهُ: see 4.<br>\
-A2-  Also, inf. n. تَحْرِيضٌ, He<br>\
rendered him free from, or rid him of, حَرَض [q. v.];<br>\
like as قَذَّيْتُهُ signifies “ I rid him of what is<br>\
termed قَذًى. ” (TA.) [Thus it bears two contr.<br>\
significations.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And, [hence, perhaps,] (ISd,<br>\
A, &amp;c.,) inf. n. as above, (S, ISd, A, &amp;c.,) He<br>\
excited, incited, urged, or instigated, him, (Zj, S,<br>\
ISd, K,) and roused him to ardour, (S,) عَلَى<br>\
القِتَالِ to fight, (Zj, S,) or عَلَى الشَّىْءِ to do the<br>\
thing, (A, * Msb,) in order that he might be<br>\
known to be such as is termed حَارِض if he held<br>\
back from it: (Zj:) so in the Kur [iv. 86 and]<br>\
viii. 66: (Zj:) or he excited, incited, urged, or<br>\
instigated, him to apply himself constantly, or<br>\
perseveringly, to fight: (TA:) [see 3:] and<br>\

same as حرّضهُ. (TS.)<br>\
-A3-  حرّض, inf. n. as above,<br>\

He dyed a garment, or piece of cloth, with إِحْرِيض<br>\
[q. v.]. (IAar, K.)<br>\

احرضهُ It (disease, A, TA) pressed heavily<br>\
upon him; or clave to him constantly: it caused<br>\
him to be at the point of death; as also ↓ حَرَضَهُ:<br>\
it corrupted, or disordered, his body, so that he<br>\
became on the brink of death. (TA: [in which<br>\
this last signification is said to be tropical: but<br>\
accord. to the A, it is evidently not so.]) It<br>\
(food) caused him to be sick, or diseased. (A.)<br>\
It (love, AO, S) corrupted, or disordered, him.<br>\
(AO, S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  He corrupted, vitiated, marred,<br>\
or destroyed, it; namely, a thing; as also ↓ حرّضهُ:<br>\
(A:) and he annulled it; rendered it null, or void.<br>\

حَرِضَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
حَرْضٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He corrupted, or vitiated, or destroyed, himself, or his own soul: (K, * TA:) and<br>\
احرض نَفْسَهُ (assumed tropical:)  he destroyed himself, or his own<br>\
soul, by telling a lie. (TA.) And سُوْءُ حَمْلِ الفَاقَةِ<br>\
يُحْرِضُ الحَسَبَ, occurring in a saying of Aktham<br>\
Ibn-Seyfee, means (assumed tropical:)  The ill-bearing of poverty<br>\
annuls the grounds of pretension to respect. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  احرضهُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ: see 2.<br>\
-A3-  احرض (assumed tropical:)  He (a<br>\
man) begat evil offspring. (S, K.)<br>\
حَرْضٌ: see حَرَضٌ, last sentence:<br>\
-A2-  and see also<br>\
what here follows.<br>\
حُرْضٌ, (Mgh,) or ↓ حُرُضٌ, (Msb,) or both, (S,<br>\
K,) the former mentioned by Sb, but in some of<br>\
the copies of his book written with fet-h (↓ حَرْضٌ),<br>\
i. q. شَجَرُ الأُشْنَانِ [The trees, or plants, from<br>\
which potash is obtained; the kind of plants<br>\
called kali, or glasswort, &amp;c.]; which are of the<br>\
kind called نَجِيل: (Az, TA:) Aboo-Ziyád says<br>\
that what is termed حُرْض is slender in the extremities (دُقَاقُ الأَطْرَافِ), but its tree is large,<br>\
being sometimes used for shade, and affords firewood, and it is that with which people wash<br>\
clothes; and he adds, we have not seen any حُرْض<br>\
purer or whiter than some which grows in ElYemámeh, in a valley thereof called جَوُّ الخَضَارِمِ:<br>\
(TA:) i. q. أُشْنَانٌ [q. v.]; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;)<br>\
with which the hands are washed after food.<br>\
(TA. [But see حَرَّاضٌ.]) So in the Kur [xii. 85],<br>\
accord. to one reading, (K,) the reading of El-<br>\
Hasan El-Basree, (Sgh,) ↓ حَتَّى تَكُونَ حُرُضًا,<br>\
(Bd,) meaning Until thou be like اشنان in dryness; as explained in the K, except that نُحُولًا is<br>\
there erroneously put for قُحُولًا: (TA:) but EsSuddee disapproved of this reading. (Sgh.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also حُرْضٌ, [and app. حُرُضٌ also,] i. q. جِصٌّ [or<br>\
Gypsum]. (TA.)<br>\
حَرَضٌ Corruptness in the body, and in the<br>\
intellect, (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, A, K,) and (assumed tropical:)  in one&#39;s<br>\
course of conduct, or tenets. (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, K.)<br>\
[See 1.]<br>\
-A2-  A man in a corrupt, or disordered,<br>\
state, and sick, or diseased, (S, K,) so that he<br>\
defiles himself (يُحْدِثُ [but in some copies of the<br>\
S this word is omitted]) in his clothes; (S;) as<br>\
also ↓ حَارِضَةٌ and ↓ حَارِضٌ and ↓ حَرِضٌ; (K;)<br>\
↓ which last also signifies a man having his<br>\
stomach in a corrupt, or disordered, state; and<br>\
suffering protracted disquietude of mind, and<br>\
disease: (TA:) also the first, (حَرَضٌ,) weary,<br>\
or fatigued: (K:) and at the point of death;<br>\
(Msb, K;) as also ↓ حَاِرضٌ; (K;) which last<br>\
also signifies one near to dying, or to perishing;<br>\
and having his body corrupted, or disordered,<br>\
by disease, so as to be at the point of death, and<br>\
so ↓ حَرِضٌ; (TA;) and [in like manner] ↓ مُحْرَضٌ<br>\
signifies dying, or perishing, from disease, being<br>\
neither living so as to be an object of hope, nor<br>\
dead so as to be an object of despair: (T, TA:)<br>\
حَرَضٌ also signifies emaciated (lit. dissolved) by<br>\
grief, or by excessive love; (AA accord. to the<br>\
S, or AO accord. to the TA, and K;) as also<br>\
↓ مُحْرَضٌ, (S,) or ↓ مُحَرَّضٌ: (K:) and heavily<br>\
oppressed by disease; or constantly affected thereby<br>\
so as to be at the point of death: so in the Kur<br>\
xii. 85: (K:) [in the CK, حَرَضًا is her erroneously put for مَرَضًا:] or it there signifies heavily<br>\
pressed upon by disease; or affected by constant<br>\
disease: (AZ:) or extremely aged; or old and<br>\
weak: (Katádeh:) and anything withering:<br>\
(TA:) [the following observation, which is inserted in the S after the first of the significations<br>\
here given of حَرَضٌ used as an epithet, and in the<br>\
K after a later signification which is said to be<br>\
tropical, applies to it, when so used, in all its<br>\
senses:] it is employed alike as sing. as pl. (Fr,<br>\
S, K) and masc. (Fr) and fem.; (Fr, K;) being<br>\
originally an inf. n.: (Fr, Msb:) or, like every inf. n. used as an epithet, it is for ذُو followed by<br>\
the inf. n., and therefore has no dual nor pl.<br>\
form: (Zj:) but some of the Arabs use ↓ حَارِضٌ<br>\
as an epithet applied to a male, and ↓ حَارِضَةٌ as<br>\
applied to a female; and these have duals and<br>\
pls.: (Fr:) and sometimes حَرَضٌ has pls.; namely<br>\
أَحْرَاضٌ; (K;) which is also pl. of حَرِضٌ and of<br>\
حَارِضٌ; or, accord. to the L, it is allowable as a<br>\
pl. of حَرِضٌ, in the place of the more common<br>\
pl. حَرِضُونَ; (TA;) and ↓ حُرْضَانِ; (K;) which<br>\
is more approved; (TA;) and حَرِضَةٌ. (K: [this<br>\
last being expressly said in the TA to be thus<br>\
written, but in the CK it is written حَرَضَة.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, applied to a man, (A,) (tropical:)  Possessing no<br>\
good; (A, K;) like ↓ حَارِضَةٌ, (TA,) which latter<br>\
is explained by As as signifying a man in whom<br>\
is no good: (T, TA:) or the former, one whose<br>\
good is not hoped for, nor his evil feared: (K:)<br>\
and a bad man: (K:) and low, base, mean, or<br>\
sordid; unable to rise from, or quit, his place;<br>\
as also ↓ حَرِيضٌ and ↓ حَرِضٌ and ↓ مُحَرَّضٌ, (K,<br>\
[this last, in the CK, written مُحَرِّض,]) or<br>\
↓ مُحْرَضٌ, (TA,) and ↓ إِحْرِيضٌ: (K:) or low,<br>\
base, mean, or sordid; in whom is no good:<br>\
(TA:) and [in like manner] ↓ حَارِضٌ signifies<br>\
bad, corrupt, or vitious, and neglected, or forsaken; (K;) and so ↓ مَحْرُوضٌ, (TA,) and<br>\
↓ حِرْضَةٌ, of which the pl. is حِرَضٌ; (TA;)<br>\
↓ مَحْرُوضٌ also signifying made, or asserted, to be<br>\
low, base, mean, or sordid; (K, TA;) and so<br>\
↓ حَارِضٌ, and ↓ حِرْضَةٌ; and this last signifying<br>\
also having in him no good: (TA:) and حَرَضٌ<br>\
likewise signifies one who does not take to himself<br>\
arms, nor fight: (Lth, K:) its pl. is أَحْرَاضٌ<br>\
(A, TA) and ↓ حُرْضَانٌ: (TA:) both these pls.<br>\
signify weak men, who will not fight: (S:) and<br>\
the former of them is explained as signifying the<br>\
lowest, basest, or meanest, sort of mankind: and<br>\
men corrupt in their course of conduct, or tenets:<br>\
also the latter of them as signifying men who<br>\
know not the place of their chief: and ↓ حَارِضٌ,<br>\
of which the fem. is with ة, signifies a stupid<br>\
man. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, applied to a she-camel,<br>\
Lean, or emaciated: (K, TA:) and ↓ حُرْضَانٌ,<br>\
so applied, vile: and perishing, or dying; in<br>\
which sense it is likewise applied to a male camel.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, applied to language, or speech,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Bad; (K;) and so, by poetic license, ↓ حَرْضٌ;<br>\
or this, accord. to Sgh, is a dial. var.: (L, TA:)<br>\
and perishing: pl. أَحْرَاضٌ. (TA.)<br>\

beginning: ―<br>\

shuffles, the arrows [in the رِبَابَة], or who deals<br>\
them forth, (الَّذِى يَضْرِبُ بِالقِدَاحِ, S, or يُفِيضُ<br>\
القِدَاحَ, A,) for the players in the game called<br>\
المَيْسِر, (S, A,) in order that he may eat of their<br>\
meat [without having contributed to pay for the<br>\
slaughtered camel]: (A:) like him who is termed<br>\
بَرَمٌ, (S, A,) always a low, or mean, person, (S,)<br>\
an object of dispraise: (A:) called thus because<br>\
of his lowness, or meanness. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also One<br>\
who does not purchase flesh-meat, nor eat it unless<br>\
he find it in the possession of another person.<br>\

a pl.,) latter half, in three places.<br>\

paragraph.<br>\
حَرَّاضٌ One who burns حُرْض [kali, or glasswort, &amp;c.] for قِلْى [or potash]; (K; [in the CK,<br>\
لِلْقَلْى is erroneously put for لِلْقِلْىِ;]) one who<br>\
makes a fire upon حُرْض for the purpose of procuring from it قِلْى; (S;) i. e. for the dyers;<br>\
and ↓ إِحْرِيضٌ also signifies one who makes a fire<br>\
upon أُشْنَان [or حُرْض]: it is said that [plants of<br>\
the kind called] حَمْض are burned, in their fresh<br>\
state, and then water is sprinkled upon their<br>\
ashes, which in consequence are compacted, and<br>\
become قِلْى [q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also One who<br>\

purpose of preparing thence نُورَة [or quick lime],<br>\
or جِصّ [which is gypsum]. (S, K.)<br>\

(see حَرَّاضٌ,) or] gypsum. (TA.)<br>\

beginning to near the end.<br>\
