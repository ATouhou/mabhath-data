-A2-  and see also حِدَأَةٌ, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
حِدَأٌ: see حِدَأَةٌ, in three places:<br>\
-A2-  and see<br>\
also what next follows.<br>\
حَدَأَةٌ (As, S, K) and ↓ حِدَأَةٌ, but the former is<br>\
the more chaste, (TA,) A double-headed فَأْس<br>\
[i. e. hoe, or adz, or axe]: (As, S, K:) [a kind<br>\
of فَأْس used in the present day is a hoe with two<br>\
heads, one at each end of the handle:] or the<br>\
head of a فَأْس: and the head of an arrow: (K:)<br>\
pl. of the former ↓ حَدَأٌ (As, S, K) [or rather this<br>\
is a coll. gen. n.] and حِدَآءٌ, (K, TA, [in the CK<br>\
حَداءٌ,]) mentioned by AO and As and A &#39;Obeyd;<br>\
(TA;) and the pl. of حِدَأَةٌ is ↓ حِدَأٌ (TA) [or<br>\
rather this, like حَدَأٌ, is a coll. gen. n.].<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
حِدَأَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) or ↓ حِدَأٌ, [but see what<br>\
follows,] sometimes pronounced ↓ حَدَأٌ, (Mgh,)<br>\
[The kite; vulgarly called حِدَايَة;] a certain<br>\
bird, (S, Mgh, K,) well known; (S, K;) a certain noxious bird; (Msb;) surnamed أَبُوالخَطَّافِ<br>\
and ابو الصَّلْتِ; (TA;) that preys upon large<br>\
field-rats (جِرْذَان): (Mgh, TA:) J and Sgh say<br>\
that the word should not be pronounced ↓ حَدَأَةٌ;<br>\
but AHei mentions this pronunciation on the<br>\
authority of [some of] the Arabs; and accord. to<br>\
IAar and IAmb, the فَأْس [see above] and this<br>\
bird were sometimes called alike ↓ حَدَأَةٌ and<br>\
↓ حَدَأٌ: the more approved pronunciation of the<br>\
name of the bird, however, is with kesr [i. e.<br>\
حِدَأَةٌ]: the pl. is ↓ حِدَأٌ (S, Msb, K) and حِدَآءٌ,<br>\
(K,) both extr., (TA,) [or rather the former is a<br>\
coll. gen. n.,] and حِدْآنٌ: (Msb, K:) and the<br>\
following are variations of the name of this bird:<br>\
حُدَّى, and حُدَيَّا, (TA,) the latter said by AHát<br>\
to be an erroneous form of the word, used by the<br>\
people of El-Hijáz, (Mgh, TA,) and ↓ حُدَيْئِيَةٌ,<br>\
app. a dim., for ↓ حُدَيْئَةٌ, also pronounced حُدَيَّةٌ,<br>\
(TS, TA,) and حُدُوٌّ, occurring in a trad. in conjunction with أُفْعُوٌّ [for أَفْعًى], (Mgh, TA,) of the<br>\
dial. of the people of Mekkeh. (TA in art. حدو.)<br>\
Hence the saying, وَرَآءَكِ بُنْدُقَة ↓ حِدَأَ حِدَأَ, (S, K,<br>\
TA,) for which the vulgar say, حَدَا حَدَا, (S,)<br>\
[accord. to some, meaning O kite, O kite, a bullet<br>\
is behind thee: accord. to others, O Hidà, O<br>\
Hidà, Bundukah is behind thee:] Esh-Sharkee<br>\
(Ibn-El-Kutámee, TA) says, (S,) حِدَأٌ and بُنْدُقَةُ<br>\
were two tribes, descendants of حِدَأُ بْنُ نَمِرَةَ and<br>\
بُنْدُقَةُ بْنُ مَظَّةَ, (S, K, *) and both of سَعْدُ العَشِيرَةِ;<br>\
(S, TA;) the former in El-Koofeh, and the latter<br>\
in El-Yemen: the former attacked the latter, and<br>\
obtained spoil from them; and then the latter<br>\
attacked the former, and destroyed them: (TA:)<br>\
and hence this saying: (S, K, TA:) or حِدَأَ is<br>\
here an apocopated form of حِدَأَة: (S, K:) so<br>\
says ISk: (S:) and AO says that by it is here<br>\
meant the bird [i. e. the kite]; and by بندقة, the<br>\
thing with which one shoots [from a cross-bow,<br>\
namely, a bullet]; and the prov. is used to caution<br>\
a person: accord. to Ibn-El-Kelbee, it is applied<br>\
to him who esteems himself cunning in an affair,<br>\
and is outwitted therein by another: accord. to<br>\
the A, to him who is threatened with an evil near<br>\
at hand. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  حِدَأَةٌ also signifies The سَالِفَة<br>\
(meaning the fore part, TA, [or the fore part<br>\
from beneath the ear to the middle of the collarbone,]) of the neck of a horse: (As, K:) pl. حِدَآء/ق.<br>\
(As, TA.)<br>\
