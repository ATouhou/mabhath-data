حَبِطَ, aor.<br>\
حَبَطَ, inf. n. حَبَطٌ, (Az, S, K, &amp;c.,)<br>\
He (a beast, Az, S, or a camel, ISd, K) ate<br>\
much, (S,) or had pain in his belly from pasture<br>\
which he found unwholesome, or from eating<br>\
much of herbage, (ISd, K,) so that he became<br>\
swollen, or inflated, thereby (S, ISd, K) in his<br>\
belly, (S,) and there would not come forth from<br>\
him (S, ISd, K) what was in it, (S,) or anything;<br>\
(ISd, K;) he did not void either thin dung or<br>\
urine, his belly being bound: (Az:) or he (a<br>\
sheep, or goat, ISk, S) became swollen, or inflated,<br>\
in his belly, in consequence of eating [the herb<br>\
called] ذُرَق, (ISk, S, K, *) which is the حَنْدَ قُوق<br>\
[i. e. the herb lotus, melilot, or bird&#39;s-foot-trefoil]:<br>\
(ISk, S:) or he (a beast) lighted upon good pasturage, and ate immoderately, so that he became<br>\
swollen, or inflated, and died: (Z, IAth:) or, in<br>\
speaking of a horse, you do not say, حَبِطَ الفَرَسُ, but<br>\
حَبِطَ قُصَيْرَى الفَرَسِ, or خَاصِرَتُهُ, or مَوْقِفُهُ, because<br>\
it means that the horse&#39;s belly became swollen, or<br>\
inflated: (ISd, Z, L:) you say also, حَبِطَ بَطْنُهُ<br>\
his belly became swollen, or inflated, so that he<br>\
died: (Az, TA:) or his (a man&#39;s) belly became<br>\
swollen, or inflated, by food &amp;c.: (Mbr, TA in<br>\
art. حبطأ:) and حَبِطَ is also said of the skin,<br>\
meaning it became swollen, or inflated. (TA.)<br>\
[See also Q. Q. 3; and see حَبَطٌ below.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, app., i. e. from حَبِطَ said of the belly,<br>\
(Az, TA,) or it is from this verb said of a beast,<br>\
(Z, IAth, TA,) حَبِطَ عَمَلُهُ, (Az, S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
حَبَطَ; (Az, Msb, K;) and حَبَطَ, aor.<br>\
حَبِطَ; (AZ,<br>\
Az, Msb, K;) the latter, says Az, heard by AZ<br>\
from an Arab of the desert, but I have not heard<br>\
it on any other authority; (TA;) inf. n. حَبْطٌ,<br>\
(Az, S, K, [but in the Msb it seems to be indicated that it is حَبَطٌ,]) with the ب quiescent,<br>\
(Az, S,) thus differing from the inf. n. of حَبِطَ<br>\
said of the belly, (Az, TA,) and حُبُوطٌ, (Az, S,<br>\
Msb, K,) which latter, accord. to AZ, is the<br>\
inf. n. of حَبَطَ like ضَرَبَ; (T, TA;) (tropical:)  His work,<br>\
or deed, became null, or void, or of no account;<br>\
it went for nothing; it perished; (Az, Msb, TA;)<br>\
for like as he of whom one says حَبِطَ بَطْنُهُ<br>\
perishes, so does the work, or deed, of the hypocrite: (Az, TA:) or it became ineffective of<br>\
reward; its reward became annulled. (S, K.)<br>\
And hence also, (Z, TA,) حَبِطَ دَمُهُ, aor.<br>\
حَبَطَ, (Z,<br>\
Msb, K, TA,) but not حَبَطَ also, as is implied in<br>\
the K, (TA,) and in this case the inf. n. is حَبَطٌ,<br>\
(Msb, * TA,) with the ب movent, (TA,) (tropical:)  His<br>\
blood (the blood of one slain, K) went for<br>\
nothing; unretaliated, and uncompensated by a<br>\
mulct. (Msb, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  حَبِطَ said of the water<br>\
of a well, i. q. أَحْبَطَ, q. v. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Said of a<br>\
wound, (S, Ibn-&#39; Abbád, K,) aor.<br>\
حَبَطَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
حَبَطٌ, with fet-h to the ب, (S, K,) It had scars<br>\
remaining after having healed: (Ibn-&#39; Abbád,<br>\
K: *) or it broke open again; or became recrudescent; syn. عَرِبَ [which has the signification<br>\
given above on the authority of Ibn-&#39; Abbád as<br>\
well as what follows it] and نُكِسَ. (S.) [See also<br>\
حَبَطٌ below.]<br>\
4<br>\
أَحْبَطَ [احبطهُ seems to signify, in its primary<br>\
acceptation, He made him, (namely a beast,) or<br>\
it, (the belly,) to be in the state termed حَبَطٌ,<br>\
which see below. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,] احبط عَمَلَهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  He (God, S, K, or a man, Msb) made his work,<br>\
or deed, to become null, or void, or of no account;<br>\
to go for nothing; to perish; (Msb, K, * TA;)<br>\
to be ineffective of reward; or he annulled its<br>\
reward. (S.) So it signifies in the Kur [xxxiii. 19,<br>\
&amp;c.]: and you say, إِنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا أَتْبَعَهُ مَا<br>\
يُحْبِطُهُ وَ إِنْ أَرْسَلَ كَلِمًا طَيِّبًا أَرْسَلَ خَلْفَهُ مَا يُحْبِطُهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [If he do a good deed, he makes to follow it that<br>\
which annuls it; and if he send forth good words,<br>\
he sends forth after them that which annuls them].<br>\
(TA.) And hence also, (Z, TA,) احبط الدَّمَ (tropical:)  He<br>\
made the blood to go for nothing; unretaliated,<br>\
and uncompensated by a mulct. (Msb, K, * TA. *)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  احبطهُ الضَّرْبُ The beating made a mark or<br>\
scar, or marks or scars, upon him. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
احبط مَآءُ الرَّكِيَّةِ, (K,) inf. n. إِحْبَاطٌ, (AA, S,) The<br>\
water of the well went away, and did not return<br>\
(AA, S, K) as it was; (AA, S;) as also ↓ حَبِطَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
حَبَطَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  احبط عَنْ فُلَانٍ He turned away<br>\
from, avoided, shunned, and left, such a one.<br>\
(IDrd, K.)<br>\
Q. Q. 3<br>\
اِحْبَنْطَى He (a man, TA) was, or<br>\
became, swollen, or inflated, in his belly: (K,<br>\
TA:) he (a man) was short and bigbellied: (S:)<br>\
he (a man) was, or became, filled with wrath, or<br>\
rage; or by repletion of the belly; as also اِحْبَنْطَأَ:<br>\
from حَبَطٌ. (TA.) [See 1.]<br>\
حَبَطٌ [inf. n. of حَبِطَ, q. v.:] A beast&#39;s having<br>\
the belly swollen, or inflated, so that what is in<br>\
it does not come forth, in consequence of eating<br>\
much: (S:) or pain in the belly, of a camel,<br>\
from pasture which he finds unwholesome, or<br>\
from herbage of which he has eaten much, so<br>\
that he becomes swollen, or inflated, therefrom,<br>\
(ISd, K,) in his belly, (TA,) and nothing comes<br>\
forth from him: (ISd, K:) or a swelling, or<br>\
inflation, of the belly, (K,) or a beast&#39;s having<br>\
the belly swollen, or inflated, (ISk, S,) from<br>\
eating [the herb called] ذُرَق: (ISk, S, K:) [see 1:]<br>\
and a swelling in the udder or other thing: (K:)<br>\
or, accord. to the M, the slightest swelling in the<br>\
udder: or, as some say, swelling, or inflation,<br>\
wherever it be, from disease or other cause. (TA.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., إِنَّ مِمَّا يُنْبِتُ الرَّبِيعُ مضا يَقْتُلُ<br>\
حَبَطًا أَوْ يُلِمُّ [Verily, of what the (rain, or season,<br>\
called) ربيع causes to grow, is what kills by inflation of the belly, or nearly does so]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
The scars, or marks, of a wound, or of whips,<br>\
upon the body, after healing: or the swollen scars,<br>\
or marks, (of whips, TA,) not lacerated: when<br>\
mangled and bleeding, they are termed عُلُوب<br>\
[pl. of عَلْب]: (K:) the excrescent flesh upon the<br>\
scars of wounds. (Sgh.)<br>\
حَبِطٌ part. n. of حَبِطَ; A camel [or other beast<br>\
having his belly swollen, or inflated, so that what<br>\
is in it does not come forth, in consequence of<br>\
eating much: or] having pain in the belly, from<br>\
pasture which he finds unwholesome, or from<br>\
herbage of which he has eaten much, so that he is<br>\
swollen, or inflated, therefrom, [in his belly,] and<br>\
nothing comes forth from him: (K:) [see حَبَطٌ:]<br>\
pl. حَبَاطَى (K) and حَبَطَةٌ. (M, TA.) You say<br>\
also فَرَسٌ حَبِطُ القُصَيْرَى A horse swollen, or inflated, in the flanks. (TA.)<br>\
حُبَاطٌ The disease in which the belly is swollen,<br>\
or inflated, from eating [the herb called] ذُرَق:<br>\
(K:) or, as Az says, accord. to some, it is with<br>\
the pointed خ, from التَّخَبُّطُ signifying “ the being<br>\
in a state of commotion, agitation, convulsion,<br>\
tumult, or disturbance. ” (TA.)<br>\
حُبَيْطٍ: see حَبَنْطًى.<br>\
حُبَيْطِىٌّ: see حَبَنْطًى.<br>\
حَبَنْطًى, with tenween, and حَبَنْطَأٌ, the ن and<br>\
the ا [which latter is written in the former word<br>\
ى being added to render the word quasi-coordinate to سَفَرْجَلٌ, (S, TA,) the derivation being<br>\
from حَبَطٌ, (TA,) A man short and bigbellied;<br>\
(S, TA;) as also حَبَنْطَاةٌ and ↓ مُحْبَنْطٍ: (S:) [see<br>\
the last of these words below:] or filled with<br>\
wrath, or rage; or by repletion of the belly;<br>\
(K;) as also حِبَنْطًى and حَبَنْطَاةٌ: (Ks, Lh:) and<br>\
this last, a woman short, ugly, and bigbellied;<br>\
(K;) also related with ء [i. e. حَبَنْطَأَةٌ, or, as it is<br>\
written in the L, حَبَنْطَآءَةٌ, but this I think a mistranscription]. (TA.) When you form the dim.,<br>\
you may reject the ن, and change the ا [which is<br>\
the final letter] into ى, so that [the dim. becomes<br>\
originally حُبَيْطِىٌ, for which, accord. to a wellknown rule,] you say ↓ حُبَيْطٍ, with kesr to the ط,<br>\
and with tenween; for the ا is not to denote the<br>\
fem. gender, that the letter preceding it should be<br>\
with fet-h, as in [حُبَيْلَى and بُشَيْرَى] the dims.<br>\
of حُبْلَى and بُشْرَى: you may also retain the ن,<br>\
and reject the ا; saying ↓ حُبَيْنِطٌ: and thus you<br>\
may do in the case of any noun having two letters<br>\
added for the purpose of quasi-coordination: you<br>\
may also put a compensation for the letter rejected<br>\
in either place, or not: if you put a compensation<br>\
in the former instance, you say ↓ حُبَيْطِىٌّ, with<br>\
teshdeed to the ى, and with kesr to the ط; and<br>\
in the latter instance, you say ↓ حُبَيْنِيطٌ. (S, O,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
حُبَيْنِطٌ: see حَبَنْطًى.<br>\
حُبَينِيطٌ: see حَبَنْطًى.<br>\
مُحْبَنْطٍ and مُحْبَنْطِئٌ A man, or child, swollen,<br>\
or inflated, in his belly: (TA:) or filled with<br>\
anger: (AZ, TA:) or who becomes angry, deeming a thing slow or tardy or late: (IAth, TA:)<br>\
or refraining as one who seeks or desires, not as<br>\
one who refuses: (TA:) or the former, becoming<br>\
angry; and the latter, swollen, or inflated: (IB,<br>\
TA:) or the former, deeming a thing slow or<br>\
tardy or late; and the latter, bigbellied: and the<br>\
latter also signifies cleaving to the ground. (TA.)<br>\
