(S, A, K,) to which, sometimes, there grow two<br>\
wings, and then it flies; (S;) or, as some say,<br>\
larger than the flea; (TA;) or like the tick;<br>\
(A;) accord. to Lth, a certain variegated insect<br>\
(دُوَيْبَّةٌ مُجَزَّعَةٌ); (TA;) the حُمَة [i. e. venom, or<br>\
sting,] of which is like that of the hornet; (A,<br>\
K;) which sticks to men, and bites, or stings;<br>\
(تَلْدَغُ;) and to which the extremities of whips<br>\
are likened; (A;) or, accord. to Az, it has no<br>\
حُمَة when it bites; but its bite occasions much<br>\
pain, [though] it has no venom (سُمّ) like that of<br>\
hornets: (TA:) or (K) a certain small insect,<br>\
(IDrd, TA,) resembling the tick, that sticks to<br>\
men: (IDrd, K, TA:) or it is smaller than the<br>\
[black beetle called] جُعَل; (ISk, TA;) or, accord.<br>\
to the M, a thing like a small pebble, speckled a<br>\
little with red or yellow, but its prevailing colour<br>\
is black; which collects, and enters beneath men,<br>\
and in their groins, or armpits, or the like, and<br>\
bites them; and rends the skins in which water<br>\
or milk is kept; or, as in the T, a certain small<br>\
insect, (TA,) which makes holes in the skins<br>\
wherein water or milk is kept, and (as Az heard<br>\
the Arabs of the desert to assert, TA) enters into<br>\
the pudenda of girls; (K, TA;) and is of the<br>\
same kind as جِعْلَان [pl. of جُعَلٌ], but smaller;<br>\
black, speckled with white: (TA:) because of<br>\
its entering into the فَرْج of the virgin girl, it is<br>\
called عَاشِقُ الأَبْكَارِ: (IB, TA:) pl. حَرَاقِيصُ.<br>\
