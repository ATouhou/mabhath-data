حَلَقَ رَأْسَهُ, (S, K,) and شَعَرَهُ, (S, M, Msb,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
حَلِقَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. حَلْقٌ (S, * M, Msb, K)<br>\
and حِلَاقٌ (S, * Msb, K *) and تَحْلَاقٌ, (S, * K,) He<br>\
removed the hair of his head [with a razor, or<br>\
shaved his head], (K,) [and he shaved off his<br>\
hair;] as also ↓ احتلقهُ; (S, K;) and ↓ حلّقهُ,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. تَحْلِيقٌ: (TA:) or the latter verb has<br>\
an intensive signification, (O, Msb,) and applies<br>\
to many objects, (S, Msb,) as in the phrase, حَلَّقُوا<br>\
رُؤُوسَهُمْ [they shaved their heads]: (S:) and you<br>\
say also, حَلَقَ مَعْزَهُ [he shore his goats]; but not<br>\
جَزَّ save in the case of sheep: (S:) [for] الحَلْقُ<br>\
with respect to the hair of human beings and of<br>\
goats is like الجَزُّ with respect to wool. (M,<br>\
TA.) [Hence,] إِنَّ رَأْسَهُ لَجَيِّدُ الحِلَاقِ [Verily<br>\
his head is well shaven]. (S, K. *) And يَوْمُ تَحْلَاق<br>\
اللَّمَمِ [The day of the shaving off of the locks<br>\
termed لمم]; which was a day fought by Teghlib<br>\
(S, K) against Bekr Ibn-Wáïl; (S;) because<br>\
their [i. e. Teghlib&#39;s] distinctive sign was shaving<br>\
(الحَلْق), (S, K,) on that day. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَقْرًا حَلْقًا,<br>\
or ↓ عَقْرَى حَلْقَى, (S, K, *) is an expression occurring in a trad.: (S:) the latter is rare; or is an<br>\
incorrect variation of the relaters of traditions:<br>\
(K:) A &#39;Obeyd says, it is عَقْرًا حَلْقًا, for which<br>\
the relaters of traditions say ↓ عَقْرَى حَلْقَى; and<br>\
the original form and meaning is عَقَرَهَا اللّٰهُ وَحَلَقَهَا,<br>\
(S,) or عَقَرَهَا اللّٰهُ عَقْرًا وَحَلَقَهَا حَلْقًا, (TA,) i. e.,<br>\
[accord. to A &#39;Obeyd,] May God wound her<br>\
body, and afflict her with pain in her حَلْق [or<br>\
fauces]: (S, K: *) but this explanation is not<br>\
valid: accord. to the T, it is a form of imprecation uttered against a woman, [not in earnest,<br>\
though denoting a degree of displeasure,] meaning may she be bereft of her husband, or became a<br>\
widow, so that she shall shave off her hair: and<br>\
Az says that عَقْرَى ↓ حَلْقَى means she is unlucky<br>\
[to others] and annoying: ISd says, it is said<br>\
to mean she is unlucky [to others]; but I am<br>\
not sure of it. (TA.) Accord. to Aboo-Nasr<br>\
(S, TA) Ahmad Ibn-Hátim, (S,) one says on the<br>\
occasion of an event at which one wonders, خَمْشَى<br>\
↓ عَقْرَى حَلْقَى, as though [meaning May she who<br>\
has occasioned this, scratch and wound her face,<br>\
and shave off her hair:] from الحَلْقُ [the act of<br>\
shaving] and العَقْرُ [the act of wounding] and<br>\
الخَمْشُ syn. with الخَدْشُ [the act of scratching]:<br>\
(S, TA: *) and he cites this verse:<br>\
↓ أَلَا قَوْمِى أُولُو عَقْرَى وَحَلْقَى<br>\
لِمَا لَا قَتْ سَلَامَانُ بْنُ غَنْمِ<br>\
(TA, and so in some copies of the S,) meaning<br>\
[Now surely] my people have women who have<br>\
wounded and scratched their faces and shaven<br>\
off their hair [on account of what the tribe of<br>\
Selámán Ibn-Ghanm has experienced]: so, says<br>\
IB, IKtt relates this verse, and so Hr in the<br>\
Ghareebeyn: but ISk, thus:<br>\
أَلَا قَوْمِى إِلَى عَقْرَى وَحَلْقَى<br>\
[and so I find it in one copy of the S:] and IJ<br>\
explains it by saying that عقرى وحلقى originally<br>\
denotes the case of a woman who, when some one<br>\
honourable in her estimation has been smitten,<br>\
or wounded, takes a pair of sandals, and beats<br>\
with them her head, and wounds or scratches it,<br>\
and shaves off her hair; and the poet means, my<br>\
people have come to the condition of wounded, or<br>\
scratched, and shaven, women. (TA.) [Fei says,]<br>\
حَلْقًا لَهُ وَعَقْرًا is a form of imprecation, meaning<br>\
May God afflict him with pain in his حَلْق [or<br>\
fauces], and wound his body: but the relaters of<br>\
traditions say عَقْرَى ↓ حَلْقَى, with the fem. alif,<br>\
making them act. part. ns.; [the former meaning,<br>\
accord. to one of the explanations given above,<br>\
an unlucky woman to others, though this is<br>\
doubtful; and] the latter meaning a woman<br>\
annoying her people: (Msb:) or both these<br>\
words are inf. ns., like دَعْوَى. (TA in art. عقر.<br>\
[See more in that art]) ―<br>\
-b3-  They said also, بَيْنَهُمُ<br>\
احْلِقِى وَقُومِى [Among them is heard the saying,<br>\
Shave, O woman, and arise]; i. e. among them is<br>\
trial, or trouble, and distress, affliction, calamity,<br>\
or adversity: and يُوْمُ احْلِقِى وَقُومِى [A day of<br>\
the saying Shave, &amp;c.; i. e., of trial, &amp;c.].<br>\

and “ his breast: ” and He (God) afflicted him<br>\
with pain in his حَلْق; as explained in a phrase<br>\
mentioned above. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (tropical:)  He filled it,<br>\
namely, a watering-trough or tank, (K, TA,) up<br>\

belly, and became contracted: ―<br>\
-b2-  and also (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\

it has two contr. meanings. (TA.) [See the<br>\
part. n. حَالِقٌ.]<br>\
-A5-  حَلِقَ, aor.<br>\
حَلَقَ, He (a man) suffered pain: or had a complaint of his حَلْق [or<br>\

-b2-  حلٌّق حَلْقَةً He<br>\
turned [or drew] a circle. (TA.) ―<br>\

name of such a one;] (tropical:)  he cancelled the stipend,<br>\
or pay, or allowance, of such a one. (TA.)<br>\

part. n.] ―<br>\
-b5-  حلَق بِإِصْبعِهِ He bent his finger round<br>\

lungs, [namely, the bronchi, consisting of two<br>\

smaller,] called the قَصَب: (Zj ubi suprà, and<br>\
Msb:) [this word (حلقوم), however, as well as<br>\
the former, is sometimes applied to the throat, or<br>\
gullet: but the former (حلق) generally signifies<br>\
the fauces; and the latter (حلقوم), the windpipe:<br>\
(see another explanation of the latter word in art.<br>\
حلقم, from the M:) a morsel of food, or the<br>\

(Msb:) and its pl. is حُلُوقٌ, (S, Msb,) and sometimes حُلُقٌ; (Msb;) or حِلَقٌ, which is extr.;<br>\
and pl. of pauc. أَحْلَاقٌ; (TA;) and أَحْلُقٌ is<br>\

analogy; but it has not been heard from the<br>\

of two thirds thereof: or a part near to the base<br>\

حُلْقٌ The state of being bereft of a child by<br>\
death; syn. ثُكْلٌ [in the CK, erroneously, شُكْل].<br>\
(K, TA.) So in the prov., لِأُمِّكَ الحُلْقُ [May<br>\
bereavement of her child befall thy mother]: or,<br>\
accord. to the A, it means shaving of the head [on<br>\
account of such, or a similar, bereavement]. (TA.)<br>\
حِلْقٌ (tropical:)  Numerous cattle: (S, K:) because the<br>\

or commander. (TA.)<br>\
حَلَقٌ: see حَلْقَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Camels branded with<br>\
the mark termed حَلْقَةٌ; (K;) and so ↓ مُحَلَّقَةٌ.<br>\

beloved child, when he belches, حَلْقَةً وَكَبْرَةً<br>\
وَشَحْمَةً فِى السُّرَّةِ, i. e. May thy head be shaven<br>\
time after time, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K, *) so that thou<br>\
mayest grow old, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA,) [and acquire<br>\
fat at the navel:] or mayest thou be preserved<br>\

(Mgh;) the حلقة of a door; and a حلقة of<br>\
people; (S, K;) in this last instance meaning a<br>\

Ibn-El-&#39;Alà, (S, Msb,) and with kesr; (K;) i. e.<br>\
↓ حَلِقَةٌ; mentioned by Fr and El-Umawee, as of<br>\
the dial. of Belhárith Ibn-Kaab; accord. to the<br>\
O; or ↓ حِلْقَةٌ, accord. to the L: (TA:) or there<br>\
is no such word as ↓ حَلَقَةٌ, (S, K,) in chaste<br>\
speech, (TA,) except as pl. of حَالِقٌ; (S, K;)<br>\
accord. to Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee; (S;) or<br>\
it is a dial. var. of weak authority; (K;)<br>\
accord. to Th, allowed by all, though of weak<br>\
authority; (S;) or it is used by poetic license;<br>\
(Mgh:) Lh says that the حلقة of a door is<br>\
حَلْقَةٌ and ↓ حَلَقَةٌ; Kr says the same of the حلقة<br>\
of a company of men; Lth says that it is the<br>\
former in this case, but that some say the latter;<br>\
A &#39;Obeyd prefers the latter in the case of a حلقة<br>\
of iron, but allows the former; and prefers the<br>\
former in the case of a حلقة of people, but allows<br>\
the latter; and Abu-l-&#39;Abbás prefers the former<br>\
in both cases, but allows the latter: (L:) the pl.<br>\
is ↓ حَلَقٌ, (S, Msb, K,) which is anomalous in<br>\
relation to حَلْقَةٌ, (S, Msb,) or [rather] a quasipl. n., (TA,) but regular in relation to حَلَقَةٌ,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) [as a coll. gen. n.,] like قَصَبٌ in relation to قَصَبَةٌ; (Msb;) and, (K,) accord. to As,<br>\
(S,) حِلَقٌ, (S, K,) as pl. of حَلْقَةٌ meaning a حلقة<br>\
of men and of iron, (TA,) like بِدَرٌ (S, K) pl.<br>\
of بَدْرَةٌ, and قِصَعٌ pl. of قَصْعَةٌ; (S;) or this is a<br>\
regular pl. of حِلْقَةٌ; (TA;) and حَلَقَاتٌ, (AA,<br>\
Yoo, S, K,) which is pl. of حَلَقَةٌ; (TA;) and<br>\
حِلَقَاتٌ, (K,) which is pl. of حِلْقَةٌ; (TA;) and<br>\
حِلَاقٌ in relation to a company of men. (TA.)<br>\
You say, اِنْتَزَعْتُ حَلْقَتَهُ [lit. I pulled off his<br>\
ring], meaning, (app., Ibn-&#39;Abbád,) (assumed tropical:)  I outwent<br>\
him, or preceded him. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.) And<br>\
كَالحَلْقَةِ المُفْرَغَةِ [Like the solid and continuous<br>\

united in words and action. (TA.) And ضَرَبُوا<br>\

series, (K, TA,) so as to form a ring [or rings]:<br>\
the last word being a pl. of حَلْقَةٌ or of حلقَةٌ.<br>\

قَبْلَ الصَّلَاةِ, i. e. Rings of men [sitting in the<br>\
mosque before prayer are forbidden]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] حَلْقَتَا الرَّحِمِ (tropical:)  [The two rings of the<br>\
womb]: one of these is the mouth of the vulva,<br>\
at its extremity; [the meatus of the vagina:]<br>\
and the other is that which closes upon the مَآء [or<br>\
seminal fluid] and opens for the menstrual discharge; [the os uteri:] (K:) or, as some say,<br>\
the other is that whence the urine is emitted;<br>\
[the meatus urinarius: but the former is the<br>\
right explanation: and hence] one says, مَآء<br>\
النُّطْفَةُ فِى حَلْقَةِ الرَّحِمِ (tropical:)  The seminal fluid fell<br>\
into the entrance of the womb. (TA.) [Hence<br>\
also,] حَلْقَةُ الدُّبُرِ (assumed tropical:)  The anus; syn. حِتَارُهُ and<br>\
شَرَجُهُ. (Mgh in art. شرج.) [See also خَاتَمٌ, last<br>\

of mail: (S, Mgh:) or arms, or weapons, in<br>\
general, (M, Mgh, Msb,) and coats of mail, and<br>\
the like. (M, TA.) It is said in a trad., إِنَّكُمْ<br>\
أَهْلُ الحَلْقَةِ والحُصُونِ [Verily ye are people of the<br>\
coat of mail, &amp;c., and of fortresses]. (TA.) ―<br>\

(AZ, K,) and of a watering-trough, (AZ,) (tropical:)  The<br>\

ripe as far as the حَلْق; which is said by some to<br>\
