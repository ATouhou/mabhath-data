حَرْقَفَ الأَتَانَ He (an ass) took hold upon<br>\
the حَرَاقِف [pl. of حَرْقَفَة] of the she-ass [with<br>\
his fore legs]. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, Sgh, K.)<br>\
حَرْقَفَةٌ The bone of the حَجَبَة, which is the<br>\
head [or crest] of the hip or haunch: (S, K:)<br>\
or the head of the upper part of the hip or<br>\
haunch: (TA in art. اكم:) or [the dual]<br>\
حَرْقَفَتَانِ signifies the place where the head of<br>\
each thigh unites with, or meets, the hip or<br>\
haunch, (Zj in his “ Khalk el-Insán,” and TA, *)<br>\
externally: (TA:) [see an explanation of حَجَبَةٌ,<br>\
in which a distinction is made between this latter<br>\
term and حَرْقَفَةٌ: a distinction is also made between<br>\
them by Zj in his work cited above, as a reference<br>\
to حجبة will show:] pl. حَرَاقِفُ (S, K) and<br>\
حَرَاقِيفُ. (TA.) One says, المَرِيضُ إِذَا طَالَتْ<br>\
ضَجْعَتُهُ دَبِرَتْ حَرَاقِفُهُ [The sick man, when his<br>\
lying on the side is of long continuance, his حراقف<br>\
became galled; i. e. the exterior prominent regions<br>\
of his hip-joints]. (S.)<br>\
حُرْقُوفٌ An emaciated beast, or horse or the<br>\
like; (S, K, TA;) i. e., whose حَرَاقِيف are apparent. (TA.)<br>\
