(L:) some of the Arabs say حَوْثَ, like as some<br>\
say حَيْثَ; (Ks, Lh, TA;) and some say حَوْثِ:<br>\
(Mughnee and TA in art. حيث:) حَوْثُ is the<br>\
original form; (ISd, TA;) but حَيْثُ is the more<br>\
chaste of the two forms, and that used in the<br>\
Kur-án; though both forms are good. (AZ, TA.)<br>\

like: so in the phrase حَوْجًا لَكَ [God grant safety<br>\
to thee]: (K:) said to a person stumbling.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
حُوجٌ Poverty. (K.)<br>\
حَاجَةٌ (S, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ حَائِجَةٌ, (AA, IDrd,<br>\
&amp;c.,) of which latter the former is a contraction,<br>\
(Kh in the &#39;Eyn, TA,) or the latter word is<br>\
unused [except as an epithet, as will be seen<br>\
below], and ↓ حَوْجَآءُ, (S, K, &amp;c.,) are syn. words,<br>\
of which the meaning is well known: (S, K,<br>\
TA:) Want; need; necessity, or necessitude;<br>\
exigency: (TA:) [whence,] اِبْنُ حَاجَةً one who<br>\
is constantly in want, or need: (Har p. 143:)<br>\
حَاجَةٌ is a more general term than فَقْرٌ; or each<br>\
of these terms is more general than the other in<br>\
some respects, and more particular in others:<br>\
(TA:) and the former signifies also a thing<br>\
wanted, needed, or required; an object of want,<br>\
of need, or of exigence; a want; a needful, or<br>\
requisite, thing, affair, or business: (A, TA:)<br>\
[and a thing to be done, an affair, or a business:]<br>\
pl. ↓ حَاجٌ, [or rather this is a coll. gen. n., of<br>\
which حَاجَةٌ is the n. un.,] and حَاجَاتٌ, [which<br>\
is of more frequent occurrence,] (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
and حِوَجٌ, [which is of rare occurrence,] (S, K,)<br>\
and حَوَائِجُ, (S, Msb, K,) which is anomalous,<br>\
(S, K,) and was disapproved by As, and pronounced by him to be post-classical, but he disapproved it only because of its being anomalous,<br>\
(S,) and he is said to have retracted his assertion<br>\
of its being post-classical, (TA,) for it is of frequent occurrence in the [classical] language of the<br>\
Arabs, (S,) in their verses and in the traditions:<br>\
(IB, TA:) it seems as though formed from the<br>\
sing. حَائِجَةٌ, (S, K,) which some assert to have<br>\
been not used; or, accord. to some, it may be pl.<br>\
of حَوْجَآءُ, changed from the regular form of حَوَاجٍ,<br>\
[originally حَوَاجِىُ,] like صَحَارٍ, by putting the<br>\
[elided] ى before the ج, agreeably with what<br>\
is often done in the language of the Arabs. (TA.)<br>\
You say, قَضَى حَاجَتَهُ [He accomplished his<br>\
want]: (TA:) a phrase which signifies [also]<br>\
he did his business; meaning he eased nature.<br>\
(ISk, TA.) And خُذْ حَاجَتَكَ مِنَ الطَّعَامِ [Take<br>\
what thou wantest, or requirest, of the food].<br>\
(A.) And فِى نَفْسِى حَاجَةٌ and ↓ حَائِجَةٌ and<br>\
↓ حَوْجَآءُ [In my mind is a want]. (AA, TA.)<br>\
And لِى عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ حَاجَةٌ [I want a thing of such<br>\
a one]. (TA.) [When the thing wanted, or not<br>\
wanted, is mentioned, or referred to by a pronoun, the subst. denoting it, or the pronoun<br>\
referring to it, is preceded by إِلَى, as in the sayings لِى حَاجَةٌ إِلَى كَذَا I have a want of such a<br>\
thing, and مَا لِى إِلَيْهِ حَاجَةٌ I have not any want<br>\
of it, and مَا حَاجَتُكَ إِلَيْهِ What is the reason of<br>\
thy want of it, or thy wanting it?] You say<br>\
also, وَلَا لَوْجَآءُ إِلَّا قَضَاهَا ↓ مَا بَقِىَ فِى حَوْجَآءُ<br>\
There remained not in his bosom a want but he<br>\
accomplished it. (TA.) [The dim. of حَوْجَآءُ is<br>\
↓ حُوَيْجَآءُ: whence the saying,] ↓ مَا لِى فِيهِ حَوْجَآءُ<br>\
وَلَا لُوَيْجَآءُ ↓ وَلَا لَوْجَآءُ وَلَا حُوَيْجَآءُ I have no want,<br>\
[nor any little want,] with respect to him, or it.<br>\
(Lh, S, K.) [See also حَوْجَآءُ, below.] In the<br>\
phrase حُجْ حُجَيَّاكَ [Seek the little thing that<br>\
thou wantest], it seems that the second and third<br>\
radical letters of the latter word [originally<br>\
حُوَيْجَآءَكَ] have been transposed [and that<br>\
حُجَيْوَآءَكَ has been then changed into حُجَيَّاكَ].<br>\
(IDrd, AAF, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَا تَرَكْتُ مِنْ حَاجَةٍ وَلَا<br>\
دَاجَةٍ I left not any act of disobedience to which<br>\
I was enticed. (TA from a trad. [But see دَاجَةٌ<br>\
in art. دوج.])<br>\
حَوْجَآءُ: see حَاجَةٌ, in four places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see<br>\
(??) ―<br>\
-b3-  You say also, (??)<br>\
(??) (??) There is not in my bosom any doubt re-<br>\
(??) him, or it. (Th, S, K.) And لَيْسَ فِى<br>\
(??) (??) ↓ أَمْرِكَ حُوَيْجَآءُ [There is not<br>\
(??) of thine affair, or<br>\
(??)<br>\
وَلَا لَوْجَآءَ, like the phrase (??)<br>\
بَيْضَآءُ, i. e. I spoke to him, and he return (??)<br>\
not a bad word nor a good one. (ISk, S, K.)<br>\
حُوَيْجَآءُ: see حَاجَةٌ, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see<br>\
حَوْجَآءُ. ―<br>\
-b3-  You say also, خُذْ حُوَيْجَآءَ مِنَ الأَرْضِ<br>\
Take thou a different and winding road of the<br>\
land. (K.)<br>\
حَائِجَةٌ: see حَاجَةٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  You say<br>\
also حَاجَةٌ حَائِجَةٌ and ↓ حَاجَةٌ حَوْجَآءُ A great<br>\
want; a thing much wanted. (TA.)<br>\
مُحْوِجٌ A man in want, needy, indigent, or<br>\
poor; (Msb, TA;) [as also ↓ مُحْتَاجٌ:] the pl.,<br>\
by rule, should be مُحْوِجُونَ because it is an<br>\
epithet applied to a rational being; but the pl.<br>\
used is مَجَاوِيجُ: some, however, reject this, and<br>\
assert that it has not been heard [as a classical<br>\
word]: (Msb:) ISd thinks that محاويج is pl. of<br>\
↓ مِحْوَاجٌ, if the latter word have been used:<br>\
(TA:) the vulgar say مَحَاوِجُ [as pl. of مُحْوِجٌ],<br>\
meaning مُحْتَاجُونَ. (Mgh.)<br>\
مِحْوَاجٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مُحْتَاجٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
