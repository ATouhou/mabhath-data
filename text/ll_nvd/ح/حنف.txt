to it. (K, TA.) And حَنَفَ عَنْهُ and عنه ↓ تحنّف<br>\
He declined from it. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  حَنِفَ, aor.<br>\
حَنَفَ,<br>\
(Msb, K,) inf. n. حَنَفٌ; (Msb;) and حَنُفَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
حَنُفَ; (K;) He had that kind of distortion<br>\
which is termed حَنَفٌ as explained below.<br>\

-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
He did according to the حَنِيفِيَّة; (S, K;) i. e. the<br>\
law of Abraham, which is the religion of ElIslám: (TA:) or he became circumcised: or he<br>\
turned away from the worship of idols; (S, K;)<br>\
and became, or made himself, a servant of God;<br>\
or applied, or devoted, himself to religious services or exercises. (S.) [See تَحَنَّثَ.]<br>\
حَنَفٌ, originally, A natural wryness: and particularly an inversion of the foot, so that the<br>\
upper side becomes the lower: so says IDrd;<br>\
(Mgh;) or a crookedness in the leg, or foot;<br>\
(S, O, K;) i. e., (S, O, but in the K “ or ”) a<br>\
turning of one of the great toes towards the<br>\
other: (S, O, K:) or [a distortion that causes]<br>\
one&#39;s walking on the outer part of the foot, on the<br>\
side in which is the little toe: (K: [and so accord.<br>\
to an explanation of ↓ أَحْنَفُ by IAar cited in the<br>\
S:]) or an inclining [app. inwards] in the fore<br>\
part of the foot. (Lth, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Accord. to Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Arafeh and the K, it signifies also A right state<br>\
or condition or tendency; and accord. to the<br>\
former, the epithet ↓ أَحْنَفُ is applied to him who<br>\
has a wry leg, or foot, only by way of presaging<br>\
a right state: but Er-Rághib explains حَنَفٌ better,<br>\
as signifying an inclining, from error, to a right<br>\
state or tendency. (TA.)<br>\
حَنَفِيَّةٌ The persons called in relation to the<br>\
Imám Aboo-Haneefeh [because they hold his<br>\
tenets]; as also ↓ أَحْنَافٌ. (TA.) حَنَفِىٌّ [is its<br>\
n. un.: and] signifies [also] one who is of the<br>\
religion of Abraham. (Mgh. [See also حَنِيفٌ.])<br>\
-A2-  A مِيضَأَة; [by which is here meant a vessel<br>\
with a tap, for the purpose of ablution, such as<br>\
is often used in a private house; and a fountain,<br>\
i. e. a tank with taps, for the same purpose, in a<br>\
mosque; because persons of the persuasion of<br>\
Aboo-Haneefeh must perform the ablution preparatory to prayer with running water, or from<br>\
a tank or the like at least ten cubits in breadth<br>\
and the same in depth;] but this application is<br>\
post-classical. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  سُيُوفٌ حَنَفِيَّةٌ, (L, K, *<br>\
TA,) or ↓ حَنِيفِيَّةٌ, (so accord. to the CK,) or<br>\
حَنْفِيَّةٌ, (so in a MS. copy of the K,) Certain<br>\
swords, so called in relation to El-Ahnaf Ibn-<br>\
Keys; because he was the first who ordered to<br>\
make them: by rule it should be أَحْنَفِيَّةٌ. (Lth,<br>\
L, K.)<br>\
حَنِيفٌ Inclining to a right state or tendency:<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA:) or right, or having a right<br>\
state or tendency; (Akh, S, TA;) thus applied<br>\
in like manner as أَعْوَرُ is applied to a crow: (S:)<br>\
[and particularly] inclining, from one religion,<br>\
to another: (Ham p. 358:) or inclining, from<br>\
any false religion, to the true religion: (Mgh:)<br>\
or inclining in a perfect manner to El-Islám,<br>\
and continuing firm therein: (K:) and any one<br>\
who has performed the pilgrimage: (As, K, TA:)<br>\
so say I&#39;Ab and El-Hasan and Es-Suddee; and<br>\
Az says the like on the authority of Ed-Dahhák:<br>\
(TA:) or one who is of the religion of Abraham,<br>\
(K, TA,) in respect of making the Sacred House<br>\
[of Mekkeh] his kibleh, and of the rite of circumcision: (TA:) [and] a Muslim; (S, Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
because he inclines to the right religion: (Msb:)<br>\
but in this last sense, it is a conventional term of<br>\
the professors: (Mgh:) [or,] accord. to AO, the<br>\
worshipper of idols, in the Time of Ignorance,<br>\
called himself thus; and when El-Islám came,<br>\
they thus called the Muslim: accord. to Akh,<br>\
it was applied in the Time of Ignorance to him<br>\
who was circumcised, and who performed the<br>\
pilgrimage to the [Sacred] House; because the<br>\
Arabs in the Time of Ignorance held nothing of<br>\
the religion of Abraham except circumcision and<br>\
that pilgrimage: accord. to Ez-Zejjájee, it was<br>\
applied in the Time of Ignorance to him who<br>\
made the pilgrimage to the [Sacred] House and<br>\
performed the ablution on account of جَنَابَة and<br>\
was circumcised; and when El-Islám came, it<br>\
was applied to the Muslim, because of his turning<br>\
from the belief in a plurality of gods: (TA:)<br>\
also one who devotes himself to religious exercises;<br>\
or applies himself to devotion: (Msb:) its predominant application is to Abraham: (Mgh:)<br>\
pl. حُنَفَآءُ. (AO, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] حَسَبٌ حَنِيفٌ<br>\

honour]; of the time of El-Islám; not old. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Short. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  A maker of sandals. (K.)<br>\
حُنَيْفٌ: see أَحْنَفُ.<br>\
حَنِيفِيَّةٌ, accord. to Th and Zj, An inclining to<br>\
a thing: but ISd says that this explanation is<br>\
nought. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The law of Abraham; which<br>\
is the religion of El-Islám: also termed مِلَّةٌ<br>\
حَنِيفِيَّةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also حَنَفِيَّةٌ.<br>\
أَحْنَفُ Having that kind of distortion which is<br>\
termed حَنَفٌ as explained above; (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
applied to a man: (S, Msb:) and so [the fem.]<br>\
حَنْفَآءُ applied to a leg or foot: (K:) accord. to<br>\
IAar, one who walks on the outer part of his<br>\
foot, (S,) or of his feet, (Msb,) on the side in<br>\
which is the little toe: (S:) or who has one of<br>\
his great toes turning towards the other: (Mgh:)<br>\
its abbreviated dim. is ↓ حُنَيْفٌ. (Msb.) See<br>\
حَنَفٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also حَنْفَآءُ, A curved<br>\
staff or stick; in the dial. of Syria. (TA.) ―<br>\
