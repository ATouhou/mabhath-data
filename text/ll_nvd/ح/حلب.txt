حَلُبَ (S, Msb, K)<br>\

حَلِبَ, (K,) inf. n. حَلَبٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and<br>\
حَلْبٌ (A, Mgh, Msb, K) and حِلَابٌ; (K;) and<br>\
↓ احتلب; (S, K;) He milked (TA) a she-camel<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, TA) &amp;c., (Msb,) a ewe, a she-goat, and a cow: (TA:) he drew forth the milk<br>\
in the udder: (A, K: [see also 10:]) and حَلَبَ<br>\
اللَّبَنَ [he drew the milk from the udder]. (S and<br>\
K in art. رثأ, &amp;c.) حَلَبْتَ بِالسَّاعِدِ الأَشَدِّ [Thou hast<br>\
milked with the strongest fore arm] is a prov.,<br>\
meaning thou hast asked aid of him who will perform thine affair, or thy want: (TA:) or, accord.<br>\
to A&#39;Obeyd, حَلَبْتُهَا الخ I have milked her &amp;c.,<br>\
meaning I have taken it by force when I could<br>\
not by gentle means. (TA in art. شد.) And<br>\
حُلِبَتْ صَرَامِ, (TA,) or صُرَامُ, (S, and some copies<br>\
of the K, in art. صرم,) The last milk was, or has<br>\
been drawn from the udder, is another prov.,<br>\
used in a case when an evil has attained its crisis:<br>\
(TA:) or it means (assumed tropical:)  the excuse reached, or has<br>\
reached, its utmost point: (AO, S and K in art.<br>\
صرم:) or the she-camel that hah [little or] no<br>\
milk was milked, or has been milked; denoting a<br>\
calamity. (IB, TA in art. صرم.) And إِنْ كُنْتَ<br>\
كَاذِبًا فَحَلَبْتَ قَاعِدًا If thou lie, mayest thou milk<br>\
sitting; i. e., lose thy camels, and become an<br>\
owner only of sheep or goats, and thus, after<br>\
having milked camels standing, milk sheep or<br>\
goats sitting: this, also, is a proverbial saying,<br>\
like the following: مَا لَهُ حَلَبَ قَاعِدًا وَاصْطَبَحَ بَارِدًا<br>\
[What aileth him?] May he [be reduced to]<br>\
milk a sheep or goat sitting, and drink cold water,<br>\
not hot milk. (TA.) And حَلَبَ الدَّهْرَ أَشْطُرَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
experienced good fortune and evil, is another prov.<br>\
(TA. [See this and other exs. in art. شطر.]) So,<br>\

explained]) [lit. She performed her act of milking,<br>\
and then desisted: but, as explained in Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Arab. prov. (i. 343 and 281), meaning (assumed tropical:)  It (a<br>\
cloud, سَحَابَة,) sent forth a fine rain, and then<br>\
ceased: and some read حَلْبَةً ↓ أَحْلَبَتْ, meaning<br>\
the same: see another reading voce جَلَبَ]. ―<br>\

upon his knees, in the posture of the milker: (A:)<br>\
he sat on his knees; (K;) or on his knee: he sat<br>\
on his knee in eating, or in milking a ewe or she-goat: he kneeled. (TA.) You say, اُحْلُبْ وَكُلْ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Kneel thou like the milker, and eat]: (A:) it<br>\
denotes a lowly [and becoming] mode of sitting<br>\
while eating. (TA.) لَيْسَ فِى كُلِّ حِينٍ احْلُبْ<br>\
فَاشْرُبْ (tropical:)  [Not at every time is it said, kneel thou,<br>\
and understand] is a prov. applied in the case of<br>\
anything that is forbidden, or denied: AA says<br>\
that الحلب signifies the act of kneeling; and<br>\
الشرب the understanding a thing: and one says to<br>\
a stupid person, اُحْلُبْ ثُمَّ اشْرُبْ Kneel thou;<br>\
then understand: one says also, ليس كلُ حين<br>\
احلب فاشرب [in Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov., ii. 437,<br>\
thus: فَأَشْرَبَ ↓ لَيْسَ كُلُّ حِينٍ أَحْلَبَ, and explained as meaning Not every time permits to<br>\
milk and then to drink: i. e. not every time aids<br>\
thee in performing a work; therefore thou shouldst<br>\
act prudently, and not expend thy wealth without<br>\
rule and measure.] (TA.)<br>\

quarter to aid: (A: [but this is probably a false<br>\
rendering, occasioned by an omission, which has<br>\
combined portions of explanations of two words:])<br>\

(K;) both signify alike: (TA:) or the former<br>\
is an epithet, signifying as above; and the latter<br>\
is a subst., signifying the animal that is milked;<br>\
(S, * A, Mgh, Msb, TA;) though some say the<br>\
reverse: or sometimes the former is used for the<br>\
latter, meaning a milch camel, &amp;c.: accord. to<br>\
Meyd, the latter signifies a she-camel that is<br>\
milked for the guest, and for the people of the<br>\
tent or house: (TA:) the former is used by some<br>\
as a sing., and by others in a pl. sense: (IB,<br>\
TA:) and [in like manner] the latter is applied<br>\
to a single she-camel or ewe or she-goat, and to<br>\
more: (K:) the pl. (of the latter, TA) is حَلَائِبُ<br>\
(S, K) and حُلُبٌ; (K;) and حُلْبٌ, supposed<br>\
to be a contraction of حُلُبٌ, also occurs as a pl.<br>\

TA voce رَكُوبٌ:) and حَلُوبٌ and the rest of the<br>\
foregoing epithets, except حَلَبُوتٌ, [which I nevertheless believe to be perfectly syn. with them,<br>\
like as خَلَبُوتٌ is syn. with خَلَّابٌ accord. to the<br>\
S,] are also mentioned as having an intensive<br>\
signification. (TA.) You say ↓ نَاقَةٌ حَلْبَانَةٌ<br>\

in each case I think that the ت is a mistake for<br>\
ة.])<br>\

the hot season, in the plains and on the sides of<br>\
valleys, cleaving to the ground so as almost to<br>\
be buried in it, not eaten by the camels, but only<br>\
by the sheep or goats, (TA,) and by the gazelles:<br>\
(S, TA:) it increases the milk, and fattens; and<br>\
gazelles are snared [while pasturing] upon it<br>\
(تحتبل عليها): (TA:) hence the expressions<br>\
تَيْسُ الحُلَّبِ and تَيْسٌ ذُو حُلَّبٍ [a buck-gazelle<br>\
that feeds upon the حلّب]: (S:) it is a curling<br>\
herb, of a dusty colour inclining to green, that<br>\
spreads upon the ground; when a piece of it is<br>\
cut off, a milky fluid flows from it: (As, S:)<br>\
AHn says, it is a plant that spreads upon the<br>\
ground, evergreen, having small leaves, with<br>\
which they tan: Aboo-Ziyád says, it is included<br>\
among what are termed الخِلْفَة, and is a tree<br>\
that expands over the ground, cleaving thereto,<br>\
intensely green, growing most when the heat<br>\
becomes great: and he adds, on the authority of<br>\
Arabs of the desert, that it lies upon the ground,<br>\
having small and bitter leaves, and a root penetrating deep into the earth, and small twigs:<br>\
it is of the kind of plants termed رَيِّحَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\

حَالِبٌ A milker; (S, K;) as also ↓ حَلُوبٌ; (K;)<br>\
but the latter has an intensive signification: (TA:)<br>\
pl. حَلَبَةٌ. (S, A.) You say, هُمْ حَلَبَةُ الإِبِلِ [They<br>\
are the milkers of the camels]. (A.) And شّتَّى<br>\
تَؤُوبُ الحَلَبَهْ [Separately the milkers return]:<br>\
(S, A:) for when they assemble to milk their<br>\
camels, each occupies himself with milking his<br>\
own, and then they return, one after another;<br>\
(S, TA;) or they water them together, and return<br>\
separately to their abodes, where each one milks:<br>\
(TA:) a prov., (S, A, TA,) relating to the<br>\
manners of men in assembling and separating:<br>\
(TA:) you should not say الحَلَمَهْ. (S.) IKtt<br>\
gives it differently, thus: حَتَّى تَؤُوبَ الحَلَبَهْ<br>\
[Until the milkers return]: but the former reading<br>\
is that commonly known. (IB, TA.) لَيْسَ لَهَا<br>\
رَاعٍ وَلٰكِنَّ حَلَبَةٌ [They (i. e. camels) have not a<br>\
pastor, but milkers] is another prov., applied to<br>\
a man who asks thine aid, and whom thou aidest,<br>\
but on whose part there is no aid. (TA. [That<br>\
is, You ask aid of one to whom you render no<br>\
aid. See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 427.]) ―<br>\
