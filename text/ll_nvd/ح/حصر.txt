حَصَرَهُ, (S, A,) aor.<br>\
حَصُرَ (S, K) and<br>\
حَصِرَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. حَصْرٌ, (S, K,) He, or it, straitened him;<br>\
(S, A, K;) so in the Kur ix. 5; (TA;) and encompassed, or surrounded, him. (S, A.) You say<br>\
حَصَرَهُ, (S, Msb,) or حَصَرَ بِهِ, (K,) aor.<br>\
حَصُرَ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. حَصْرٌ, (Msb,) It (a hostile party,<br>\
ISk, S, Msb, or a people, K) encompassed him,<br>\
or surrounded him, (Msb, K,) and prevented him<br>\
from going to his business: (Msb:) or straitened<br>\
him, and encompassed or surrounded him; as also<br>\
↓ حَاصَرَهُ, inf. n. مُحَاصَرَةٌ and حِصَارٌ. (ISK, S.)<br>\
The ↓ محاصرة of an enemy is well known. (K.)<br>\
You say العَدُوُّ ↓ حَاصَرَهُمُ, inf. ns. as above, [The<br>\
enemy besieged, or beset, them;] and بَقِينَا فِى<br>\
الحِصَارِ أَيَّامًا We remained in the state of siege<br>\
some days; or in the place of confinement; and<br>\
حُوصِرُوا مُحَاصَرَةً شَدِيدَةً [They were besieged, or<br>\
beset, vehemently]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also حَصَرَهُ, (S, A,<br>\
K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
حَصُرَ (Mgh, K) and<br>\
حَصِرَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
حَصْرٌ, (A, Mgh, K,) He, (Akh, S, A,) or it, (S,)<br>\
confined, kept close, imprisoned, detained, retained,<br>\
restrained, withheld, or prevented, him; (A O,<br>\
Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee, Akh, S, A;) as also<br>\
↓ أَحْصَرَهُ: (Aboo-&#39; Amr Esh-Sheybánee, S:) or a<br>\
distinction should be made between these two<br>\
forms, as will be seen in what follows. (TA.)<br>\
And It (a hostile party, and a disease, ISK, Th,<br>\
Msb) detained, restrained, withheld, or prevented,<br>\
him (ISK, Th, Msb, K) from journeying &amp;c.;<br>\
(K;) as also ↓ احصرهُ: (AO, * ISk, Th, Msb, K:)<br>\
or the latter signifies it (disease) prevented him<br>\
from journeying, or from a thing that he desired:<br>\
so in the Kur ii. 192: (ISk, S:) or [more properly] it (disease, or urine, [&amp;c.,]) made him to<br>\
restrain himself: (Akh, S, K:) or إِحْصَارٌ signifies<br>\
the being prevented from attending the religious<br>\
rites and ceremonies of the pilgrimage, by disease, or the like: (IAth:) or أُحْصِرَ is said when<br>\
a man is turned back from a course which he<br>\
desired: and حُصِرَ, when he is confined, or restrained, or the like: (Yoo:) or, accord. to Fr,<br>\
the Arabs say, of him whom fear or disease prevents from accomplishing his pilgrimage or his<br>\
عُمْرَة [q. v.], (Mgh, * TA,) and of any one that is<br>\
not forcibly constrained, as by imprisonment, or<br>\
by enchantment or the like, (TA,) ↓ أُحْصِرَ: and<br>\
of him who is imprisoned or restrained by a<br>\
Sultán, or by one who overpowers, حُصِرَ: this<br>\
distinction is observed by them: (Mgh, * TA:)<br>\
but if you mean that the constraining power of<br>\
the Sultán is a preventing cause, and you do not<br>\
refer to the act of the agent, it is allowable for<br>\
you to say, الرَّجُلُ ↓ قَدْ أُحْصِرَ: and if you say of<br>\
him whom pain or disease makes to restrain himself, that the disease, or fear, restrains him, it is<br>\
allowable for you to say, حُصِرَ: or, as Aboo-Is-<br>\
hák the Grammarian says, the correct rule, accord.<br>\
to the lexicologists, is, that one says of him whom<br>\
fear and disease prevent, ↓ أُحْصِرَ: and of him who<br>\
is confined or restrained by another, حُصِرَ: and<br>\
thus it is because he who refrains from conducting<br>\
himself freely in an affair restrains himself: and<br>\
they saying حَصَرْتُهُ means that thou hast restrained<br>\
him; not that he has restrained himself: so that<br>\
it is allowable to say in this case [when you do<br>\
not mention the agent], ↓ أُحْصِرَ. (TA.) [Accord.<br>\
to Z,] حُصِرَ عَنْهُ and دُونَهُ [lit. He was withheld<br>\
from it] is said when a man is ashamed at a thing,<br>\
and leaves it, or abstains from it, or when he is<br>\
unable to effect a thing, or finds his wish difficult<br>\
of attainment. (A. [See also حَصِرَ, in what follows, in this paragraph.]) حَصَرْتُ الغُرَمَآءَ فِى المَالِ<br>\
means حَصَرْتُ قِسْمَةَ المَالِ فِى الغُرَمَآءِ [I restricted<br>\
the division of the property among the creditors]:<br>\
for the prevention is not against them, but against<br>\
others, from their being shares with them in the<br>\
property: the phrase is inverted, like أَدْخَلْتُ<br>\
القَبْرَ المَيِّتَ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also حَصَرَهُ, (K,) aor.<br>\
حَصُرَ,<br>\
inf. n. حَصْرٌ, (TA,) He took the whole of it; (K;)<br>\

it; took it to himself. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And حُصِرَ, (S,<br>\
A, Mgh, K,) and ↓ أُحْصِرَ, (S, A, K,) or حُصِرَ<br>\
بِغَائِطِهِ, and ↓ أُحْصِرَ, (Ks,) or حُصِرَ عَلَيْهِ خَلَاؤُهُ,<br>\
aor. يُحْصَرُ, inf. n. حَصْرٌ [and حُصْرٌ, or this latter<br>\
is a simple subst.], (Ibn-Buzurj,) He (a man,<br>\
S, A) suffered suppression of the feces, or constipation of the bowels: (Ks, Ibn-Buzurj, S, A,<br>\
Mgh, K:) [distinguished from أُسِرَ: (see حُصْرٌ:)<br>\
or] حُصِرَ عَلَيْهِ بَوْلُهُ signifies he suffered suppression<br>\
of his urine.. (Ibn-Buzurj.)<br>\

حَصُرَ; and حَصِرَ, aor.<br>\

(K,) or أُحْصِرَ; (so in the TA;) It (the orifice of<br>\
her teat) was, or became, narrow. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And حَصِرَ, aor.<br>\
حَصَرَ, inf. n. حَصَرٌ, He was, or became, unable to express his mind, to say what he<br>\
would, to find words to express what he would<br>\
say; he faltered in speech; (S, Mgh, K, Expos.<br>\
of the “ Mufassal ” of Z;) by reason of shame and<br>\
confusion of mind, or other [accidental] cause;<br>\
wherein, only, it differs from عَيِىَ. (Expos. of<br>\
the “ Mufassal ” of Z.) And also, (Msb, K,) or<br>\
حَصِرَ فِى القِرَآءَةِ, (S,) He faltered, or became impeded, and was unable to proceed, in reading, or<br>\
recitation. (S, Msb, K.) And حَصِرَ. aor.<br>\
حَصَرَ, He<br>\
was ashamed, and cut short, as though the affair<br>\
straitened him like as the prison straitens the<br>\
prisoner. (TA.) And حَصِرَ عَنْهُ He became impeded, and was unable to do it. (S.) And حَصِرَ<br>\
عَنِ المَرْأَةِ, aor.<br>\

come to you, their bosoms being contracted so that<br>\
they are incapable of fighting you; or their<br>\
bosoms shrinking from fighting you]: (TA:) Akh<br>\
and the Koofees allow that the pret. here may be<br>\
a denotative of state; but Sb does not allow this<br>\
use of the pret. unless with قَدْ; and he makes<br>\
حصرت صدورهم to be an imprecation [meaning<br>\
may their bosoms become contracted]: (S:) accord.<br>\
to Fr, the Arabs say, أَتَانِى فُلَانٌ ذَهَبَ عَقْلُهُ,<br>\
meaning قَدْ ذهب عقله: Zj says, Fr makes حصرت<br>\
a denotative of state; but it is not so unless with<br>\
قد: They says that if قد be understood, it approximates to a denotative of state, and becomes like<br>\
a noun; and some read حَصِرَةً صُدُورُهُمْ: AZ does<br>\
not allow this use of the pret. [as a denotative of<br>\
state] unless preceded by وَ or قد. (TA.) ―<br>\

drank, and such a one was niggardly to them,<br>\
(AA, S, L,) not expending upon those who drank<br>\
with him. (L.) ―<br>\
