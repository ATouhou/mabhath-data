حَنَطَ, (K,) aor.<br>\
حَنُطَ, (TK,) inf. n. حُنُوطٌ, It<br>\
(seed-produce) attained to the time for its being<br>\
reaped; as also ↓ احنط. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It (a tree of<br>\
the kind called رِمْث) became mature, and its<br>\
leaves became white; as also ↓ احنط: (S:) or it<br>\
became white and mature, (K, TA,) and there<br>\
came forth upon it a dust-coloured fruit, and what<br>\
resembled pieces of glue appeared upon its tops;<br>\
(TA;) as also حَنِطَ, aor.<br>\
حَنَطَ; (K, TA;) and<br>\
↓ احنط: (TA:) [the last, though omitted in the<br>\
K, seems to be the most common:] or its colour<br>\
became white inclining to yellowness, and its<br>\
odour sweet: (IAth:) Az relates, on the authority<br>\
of IAar, that one says, أَوْرَسَ الرِّمْثُ, and ↓ احنط;<br>\
like خَضَبَ العَرْفَجُ: and one says, of the رِمْث,<br>\
when it first breaks out for its leaves to come<br>\
forth, قَدْ أَقْمَلَ; and when it has increased little<br>\
by little, قَدْ أَدْبَى; and when its greenness has<br>\
increased, بَقَلَ: and when it has become white<br>\
and mature, حَنَطَ: (TA:) or ↓ احنط is said of a<br>\
tree, and of a herb, meaning its fruit became<br>\
mature; and so حَنَطَ, inf. n. حُنُوطٌ. (AHn.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
It (leather) became red. (S, K.) [The inf. n. of<br>\
the verb in this sense is not mentioned.]<br>\

حنّطهُ, inf. n. تَحْنِيطٌ (S, TA;) in the K,<br>\
↓ حَنَطَهُ, aor.<br>\
حَنُطَ; which is a mistake; (TA;) He<br>\
prepared him (a dead person [i. e. for burial])<br>\
[and also it (grave-clothing)] with حَنُوط [q. v.];<br>\
(S, K;) as also ↓ احنطهُ. (K.) And [hence,]<br>\
↓ أُحْنِطَ [lit. He was prepared for burial with<br>\
حنوط, is used to signify] he died. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
احنط: see 1, in five places.<br>\
-A2-  أَحْنَطَهُ: and<br>\
أُحْنِطَ: see 2. ―<br>\
-b2-  The former also signifies He, or<br>\
it, made him, or it, to bleed: made him, or it, to<br>\
be bloody; or smeared, befouled, or defiled, him,<br>\
or it, with blood: it (blood) befouled, or defiled,<br>\
him, or it. (IAar.)<br>\

prepared [for burial] with حَنُوط. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
or تحنّط بِالحَنُوطِ, (S,) He (a man) made use of<br>\
حنوط for himself, in his clothing: (S, * TA:) so<br>\
in a trad.: meaning, on his going forth to battle;<br>\
as though desiring thereby to prepare himself for<br>\
death, and to induce himself to endure the fight<br>\
with patience. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استحنط [lit. He desired to be prepared for<br>\
burial with حَنُوط: and hence meaning] he (a<br>\
man, Fr) emboldened himself, or became emboldened, to encounter death, holding his life in<br>\
light estimation. (Fr, K.)<br>\
حِنْطَةٌ Wheat; and the grain of wheat; syn.<br>\
بُرٌّ (S, Msb, K) and قَمْحٌ and طَعَامٌ; (Msb;) of<br>\
the first three of which words, بُرٌّ is the most<br>\
chaste; (S in art. بر;) the well-known grain<br>\
called بُرٌّ: (TA:) chewed, and applied as a poultice, it is good for the bite of a dog: (K:) or,<br>\
correctly, what is chewed thereof disperses humours; but for the bite of a dog, it is coarsely<br>\
pounded, and put upon the bite; as is said by the<br>\
author of the “ Minháj: ” and one of its wellknown properties is this; that when it is put upon<br>\
a piece of heated iron, and powdered, and ringworms (قَوَابِىّ) are smeared with the moisture<br>\
thereof, it removes them: (TA:) pl. حِنَطٌ.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
حِنْطِىٌّ An eater of much حِنْطَة [or wheat], in<br>\

حَنُوطٌ (S, IAth, Msb, K) and ↓ حِنَاطٌ (IAth,<br>\
Msb, K) [Perfume such as is termed] ذَرِيرَةٌ: (S:)<br>\
or odoriferous substances (IAth, Msb, K) of any<br>\
kind (K) that are mixed (IAth, Msb, K) for a<br>\
corpse, (Msb, K,) in particular, (Msb,) or for<br>\
grave-clothes and for the bodies of the dead, consisting of ذَرِيرَة, or musk, or ambergris, or camphor, or other substance, namely, Indian cane,<br>\
or sandal-wood, bruised: derived from حَنَطَ said<br>\
of the رِمْث, signifying that its colour became<br>\
white inclining to yellowness, and its odour<br>\
sweet: (IAth:) the term حنوط is applied to<br>\
anything with which a corpse is perfumed, consisting of musk and ذَرِيرَة and sandal-wood and<br>\
ambergris and camphor, and other things that<br>\
are sprinkled upon it for the purpose of perfuming<br>\
it and drying up its moisture. (Msb.)<br>\
حِنَاطَةٌ The trade of the حَنَّاط [q. v.]. (S, K.)<br>\
حَنَّاطٌ A seller of حِنْطَة [or wheat]; (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K;) as also ↓ حَنَّاطِىٌّ; (K;) a rel. n. from the<br>\
former. (Msb.) [The pl.] حَنَّاطُونَ is explained<br>\
by the lawyers as signifying Persons who transport wheat (حِنْطَة) from the ship to the houses.<br>\

قَوْمٌ حَانِطُونَ A people whose seed-produce has<br>\
attained to the time for its being reaped: [in this<br>\
sense also] a possessive epithet. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
[act. part. n. of حَنَطَ, or,] accord. to Sh and ISd,<br>\
an act. part. n. of أَحْنَطَ, as applied to the رِمْث,<br>\
contr. to analogy, meaning [Mature and] having<br>\
its leaves become white; as also ↓ مُحْنِطٌ: (TA:)<br>\
and, applied to a tree, and a herb, having its fruit<br>\
mature. (AHn.) Also, accord. to Sh, i. q.<br>\
وَارِسٌ, in the phrase حَانِطُ الغَضَى [app. meaning<br>\
What is putting forth its leaves, of trees of the<br>\
kind called غَضًى]: but accord. to Ibn-&#39;Abbád<br>\
