inf. n. حَوْزٌ, (K, TA,) He had, held, or possessed,<br>\
it; had it, or held it, in his possession; had, took,<br>\
got, obtained, or acquired, possession, or occupation, of it; (AA, K, * TA; [المَلِكُ, given as an<br>\
explanation of the inf. n. in the CK, is a mistake<br>\
for المِلْكُ;]) he took, or received, it; he had it,<br>\
or took it, to, or for, himself. (AA, TA.) [See<br>\
حَوْزَةٌ, below. Hence, It comprehended, comprised, or embraced, it.] ―<br>\
-b3-  حَازَ الأَرْضَ, inf. n.<br>\
حَوْزٌ, He took for himself the land, and marked<br>\
out its boundaries, and had an exclusive right to<br>\

―<br>\
-b4-  حَازَ, aor. يَحُوزُ, also signifies [He or] it overcame, conquered, or mastered, [a thing,] as in an<br>\
instance in art. حز, voce حَزَّازٌ: (Sh, K:) [as<br>\

-b5-  Also, (A, TA,) inf. n. حَوْزٌ, (K,)<br>\

(K:) [as also حَاذَهَا:] you say [also] ↓ أَحِزْهَا,<br>\
[unless this be a mistranscription for حُزْهَا,] meaning, Drive thou them vehemently. (TA.) Also<br>\
He drove the camels to water; (A;) and so<br>\

S, K,) inf. n. تَحْوِيزٌ, (K,) signifies he drove them<br>\

You say, تحوّزت الحَيَّةُ, and ↓ تحيزّت, The serpent writhed, or twisted, about. (Both in the S;<br>\
and the latter in the K in art. حيز.) And مَا لَكَ<br>\
تَتَحَوَّزُ تَحَوُّزَ الحَيَّةِ, and تَحَيُّزَ الحَيَّةِ ↓ تَتَحَيَّزُ,<br>\
Wherefore dost thou writhe about like the writhing about of the serpent? the latter verb, accord.<br>\

(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He removed, withdrew, or retired to a<br>\
distance, (A&#39;Obeyd, S, K,) and drew back, (S,)<br>\

مِنِّى خَشْيَةً أَنْ أَضِيفَهَا ↓ تَحَيَّزُ<br>\

away from him: (S, K:) and انحاز إِلَيْهِ he turned<br>\
to, or towards, him; and he joined himself to<br>\
him. (Har pp. 122 and 326.) You say of friends,<br>\
انحازو عَنِ العَدُوِّ, and حَاصُوا; [They turned<br>\
away from the enemy;] and of enemies, اِنْهَزَمُوا,<br>\
and وَلَّوْ مُدْبِرِينَ. (S, TA.) Or انحاز signifies<br>\
He separated himself from others that he might<br>\
be with those who were fighting. (Aboo-Is-hák,<br>\
TA.) And انحاز الرَّحُلُ إِلَى القَوْمِ signifies the<br>\
same as إِلَيْهِمْ ↓ تحيّز [The man turned, removed,<br>\
withdrew, or retired, or he joined himself, to the<br>\
company of men]. (Msb.) See 5, in two places.<br>\

Q. Q. 2<br>\

حَيْوِزٌ,] He turned aside to a حَيِّز [or place, &amp;c.].<br>\
(Mgh.) You say also تحيّز المَالُ [The property,<br>\
or the camels or the like,] became drawn, collected,<br>\
or gathered, together; or drew, collected, or gathered, themselves together; to a حَيِّز. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also 5, throughout; and see 7.<br>\
حَوْزٌ inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. ―<br>\
-b2-  فِى حَوْزِهِ: see حَوْزَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  A place of which a man takes possession,<br>\
(TA,) and around which a dam (مُسَنَّاةٌ) is made:<br>\
(K, TA:) pl. أَحْوَازٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  حَوْزُ الدَّارِ: see<br>\
حَيِّزٌ.<br>\
-A3-  لَيْلَةُ الحَوْزِ The first night during which<br>\
camels repair towards the water (As, S, K) when<br>\
it is distant from the pasture: (As, S:) because<br>\
they are driven gently that night: but when their<br>\
faces are turned towards the water and they are<br>\
left to pasture that night, the night is called<br>\
لَيْلَةُ الطَّلَقِ. (TA.) One says to a man, when he<br>\
holds back respecting an affair, دَعْنِى مِنْ حَوْزِكَ<br>\
وَطَلَقِكَ (assumed tropical:)  [Let me alone and cease from this and<br>\
that discursion of thine]. (TA.) And one says also,<br>\
طَوَّلَ عَلَيْنَا فُلَانٌ بِالْحَوْزِ وَالطَّلَقِ قَبْلَ القَرَبِ (assumed tropical:)  [Such<br>\
a one was prolix, or tedious, to us with this and<br>\
that discursion before coming to the point]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  حَوْزٌ is also used as an epithet; though properly an inf. n.: you say, سَوْقٌ حَوْزٌ [A gentle<br>\
driving: or a vehement driving]. (TA.)<br>\
حَوْزَةٌ i. q. حَيِّزٌ, as pointed out in two places<br>\
below. (S, Msb, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A thing that<br>\
is in one&#39;s possession or occupation; a thing that<br>\
is one&#39;s property: so in the saying of a certain<br>\
woman, وَأَحْمِى حَوْزَةَ الغَائِبِ (assumed tropical:)  And I guard from<br>\
encroachment the property of the absent: meaning her فَرْج, which was the property of her<br>\
husband by the marriage-contract: whence it<br>\
appears that, if this saying be the only ground<br>\
upon which Az has asserted that one of the significations of حَوْزَةٌ is the فَرْج of a woman, [as is<br>\
also said in the K,] his assertion requires consideration; for a woman&#39;s فرج is her own when<br>\
she has no husband; and when she is married,<br>\
it is her husband&#39;s property. (L, TA.) You say<br>\
also, صَارَفِى حَوْزَتِهِ, and ↓ فِى حَوْزِهِ, [and ↓ فى حَيِّزِهِ,]<br>\
It became in his possession, or occupation. (L,<br>\
TA.) And فُلَانٌ مَانِعٌ حَوْزَتَهُ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one defends,<br>\
or guards, from encroachment, or invasion, or<br>\
attack, what is in his حَيِّز [or place; meaning,<br>\
in his possession or occupation]. (TA.) In like<br>\
manner, a poet says,<br>\
حَمَى حَوْزَاتِهِ فَتُرِكْنَ قَفْرًا<br>\
He guarded from encroachment his tracts of<br>\
pasture-land [so that they were left deserted].<br>\
(Fr, TA.) And it is said in a trad., فَحَمَى حَوْزَةً<br>\
الإِسْلَامِ (tropical:)  And he defended, or protected, or<br>\
guarded, from encroachment, or invasion, or<br>\
attack, the limits, [meaning, what the limits comprised, i. e., the territory,] and the tracts, or<br>\
regions, of El-Islám [meaning, of the Muslims].<br>\
(TA.) حَوْزَةُ المُلْكِ signifies [in like manner]<br>\
بَيْضَتُهُ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The seat of regal power: or the<br>\
heart, or principal part, of the kingdom]. (S, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  Nature; or natural disposition, temper, or<br>\
other quality or property; (K, TA;) whether<br>\
good or evil. (TA.)<br>\
حَيِّزٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) of the measure فَيْعِلٌ,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) from الحَوْزُ, (S, * Mgh,) as signifying “ the drawing, collecting, or gathering,<br>\
together,” (Mgh,) originally حَيْوِزٌ, (TA,) and<br>\
also contracted into حَيْزٌ, (S, Msb, TA,) like هَيِّنٌ<br>\
and هَيْنٌ, and لَيِّنٌ and لَيْنٌ; (S, TA;) [The<br>\
continent, or container, or receptacle, of anything; like بَيْضَةٌ; as also ↓ حَوْزَةٌ, q. v.:] any<br>\
place in which a thing is: (Mgh:) in scholastic<br>\
theology, the imaginary portion of space occupied<br>\
by a thing having extent, as a body; or by a<br>\
thing not having extent, as an indivisible atom:<br>\
in philosophy, the inner surface of a container,<br>\
which is contiguous [in every part] to the outer<br>\
surface of the thing contained: and [hence,]<br>\
الحَيِّزُ الطَبِيعِىُّ [the proper natural place of a<br>\
thing;] that in which the nature of a thing<br>\
requires it to be. (KT.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A quarter, tract,<br>\
region, or place, considered relatively, or as part<br>\
of a whole; or a part, or portion, of a place;<br>\
syn. نَاحِيَةٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb;) as also ↓ حَوْزَةٌ:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) so the authors on practical law<br>\
mean by حَيِّزٌ; such, for instance, as a room,<br>\
or an apartment, of a house: (Mgh:) pl. أَحْيَازٌ,<br>\
(S, Msb, TA,) which is extr., (TA,) being from<br>\
the contracted form [حَيْزٌ]: (Msb:) by rule it<br>\
should be أَحْوَازٌ, (Az, Msb, TA,) like أَمْوَاتٌ, pl.<br>\
of مَيِّتٌ [and مَيْتٌ]: (Az, TA:) or by rule [if<br>\
from the uncontracted form حَيِّزٌ] it should be<br>\
حَيَائِزُ, with hemz, accord. to Sb; or حَيَاوِزُ, with<br>\
و, accord. to Abu-l-Hasan. (TA.) حَيِّزُ الدَّارِ,<br>\
(S, Msb, TA,) as also الدّارِ ↓ حَوْزُ, (TA,) signifies<br>\
What is annexed to the house, (S, TA,) or appertains thereto, (Msb,) of the مَرَافِق (S, Msb, TA)<br>\
and مَنَافِع (TA) and نَوَاحٍ; (Msb;) [i. e., of the<br>\
conveniences thereof, such as the privy and the<br>\
kitchen and the like, and other parts or apartments;] such are termed collectively أَحْيَازُ الدَّارِ;<br>\
(Msb;) and each part or apartment (نَاحِيَة), by<br>\
itself, is termed حَيِّزٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence the saying,] أَنَا فِى حَيِّزِهِ وَكَنَفِهِ (tropical:)  [I am in his quarter<br>\
and protection]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And hence also<br>\
the saying,] فِى حَيِّزِ التَّوَاتِرُ (tropical:)  In the manner, and<br>\
place, of [that kind of transmission which is<br>\
termed] التواتر [which is “ transmission by such<br>\
a number of persons as cannot be supposed to<br>\
have agreed to a falsehood: ” as explained in the<br>\
Mz, 3rd نوع]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And صَارَ فِى حَيِّزِهِ:<br>\
see حَوْزَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b6-  [And عَلَى حَيِّزِهِ By himself or<br>\
itself.]<br>\
الإِثْمُ حَوَّازُ القُلُوبِ: see حَزَّازُ, in art. حز.<br>\
أَوْ مُتَحَيِّزًا إِلَى فِئَةٍ, in the Kur [viii. 16], signifies Or turning aside to a different company of<br>\
the Muslims: (Mgh, Msb: *) or the meaning is,<br>\
or separating themselves from others to betake<br>\
themselves to [a different company of] those engaged in fighting. (Aboo-Is-hák, TA.) The original form of مُتَحَيِّزٌ is مُتَحَيْوِزٌ. (TA.)<br>\
قِطْعَةٌ مِنَ الأَرْضِ مُسْتَحِيزَةٌ [A portion of the<br>\
earth, or of land, comprehended within certain<br>\
limits]. (M and K in art. بلد.)<br>\
