حَاكَ, aor. يَحِيكُ, inf. n. حَيْكٌ and حَيَكٌ and<br>\
حِيَاكَةٌ, accord. to Lth, signifies He wove a piece<br>\
of cloth: [and it is said in the K, in art. حوك,<br>\
that the root of the verb in this sense is with و<br>\
and with ى:] but Az says that this is a mistake;<br>\
and that the verb is only حاك having for its<br>\
aor. يَحُوكُ, inf. n. حَوْكٌ. (TA. [See, however,<br>\
what follows.])<br>\
-A2-  حاك, (S, K,) or حاك فِى مِشْيَتِهِ,<br>\
(TA,) aor. يَحِيكُ, inf. n. حَيَكَانٌ (S, K) and<br>\
حَيْكٌ (K) and حَيَكَى (Mbr, TA) [and حِيَاكَةٌ,<br>\
which see in what follows], He (a man, TA)<br>\
walked with an elegant and a proud and selfconceited gait, with an affected inclining of the<br>\
body from side to side, or with a twisting of the<br>\
back: or he moved about his shoulder-joints and<br>\
his body in walking, (K, TA,) having much<br>\
flesh; which manner of walking in women is<br>\
commended, but in men it is discommended;<br>\
for the woman walks thus by reason of the largeness of her thighs; but the man, when his thighs,<br>\
or legs, are wide apart: or, as some say, it signifies he trod the ground vehemently: (TA:)<br>\
or he moved about his shoulder-joints, and parted<br>\
his legs widely, in walking, [as short persons do:<br>\
for] حَيَكَانٌ signifies the manner of walking<br>\
of him who is short: (S:) or a walking in<br>\
which a man moves about his posteriors: all<br>\
which meanings are borrowed from the action<br>\
of the حَائِك [or weaver, who straddles when at<br>\
work]: حِيَاكَةٌ, likewise, signifies a walking with<br>\
an elegant and a proud and self-conceited gait,<br>\
with an affected inclining of the body from side<br>\
to side, or with a twisting of the back, and in<br>\
a lagging manner. (TA.) And you say also,<br>\
↓ جآءَ يَتَحَيَّكُ, and ↓ يَتَحَايَكُ, meaning He came<br>\
walking with his legs parted as though there were<br>\
something between them. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  حاك, (K,)<br>\
aor. يَحِيكُ, inf. n. حَيْكٌ, (TA,) said of a sword,<br>\
(K,) and of an axe, (TA,) It made an impression,<br>\
or had effect; as also ↓ احاك. (K, TA.) حاك فِيهِ<br>\
(S) and فيه ↓ احاك (S, K) and ↓ اَحاكهُ, (K,)<br>\
said of a sword, signify the same: (S, K:) one<br>\
says, فِيهِ السَّيْفَ ↓ ضَرَبَهُ فَمَا أَحَاكَ, i. e. [He struck<br>\
him, but the sword] made no impression, or had<br>\
no effect, upon him. (S, TA.) And حَاكَت الشَّفْرَةُ<br>\
The [knife called] شفرة cut; as also ↓ احاكت.<br>\
(K.) And ما تَحِيكُ المُدْيَةُ اللَّحْمَ [The butcher&#39;s<br>\
knife does not cut the flesh-meat], and ما تحيك فِيهِ:<br>\
both signify alike. (El-Ámidee, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
حاك القَوْلُ فِى القَلْبِ, inf. n. حَيْكٌ, (assumed tropical:)  The saying<br>\
took effect upon the heart; (Sh, S, K, TA;) and<br>\
became fixed therein. (Sh, TA.) And مَا يَحِيكُ<br>\
فِيهِ المَلَامُ (assumed tropical:)  Blame does not make any impression<br>\
upon him. (S.) And مَا يَحِيكُ كَلَامُكَ فِى فلَانٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Thy speech does not make any impression upon<br>\
such a one. (TA.) And it is said [in a trad., as<br>\
some read it], الإِثْمُ مَا حَاكَ فِى صَدْرِكَ وَكَرِهْتَ<br>\
أَنْ يَطَّلِعَ عَلَيْهِ النَّاسُ (assumed tropical:)  Sin is that which makes an<br>\
impression upon thy mind, and becomes fixed<br>\
[therein, and with which thou dislikest that men<br>\
should become acquainted]. (Az, TA. [See also<br>\
حَكَّ; and see حَزَّ.])<br>\
