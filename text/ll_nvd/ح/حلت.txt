حِلْتِيتٌ; (S, K;) for which you should not say<br>\
حِلْتِيثٌ, with ث; sometimes written حِلِّتِيتٌ; (S;<br>\
as in one copy; but in another, and in that from<br>\
which SM quotes, حِلِّيتٌ;) and ↓ حِلِّيِتٌ; (K;)<br>\
[Assa, or asa: of which there are two kinds;<br>\
حِلْتِيتٌ مُنْتِنٌ, or assa fœtida; and حلتيتٌ طَيّبٌ<br>\
or assa dulcis:] the gum of the أَنْجُذَان: (S K:)<br>\
ISd says, حلتيت is an Arabic or an arabicized<br>\
word: [and is the name of a certain plant:] I<br>\
have not heard that it grows in Arabia; but it<br>\
grows between Bust and the country of El-Keekán:<br>\
it is he says, a plant that lies prone upon the<br>\
ground, and from the middle of it there comes<br>\
forth, and rises high, a reed, or cane, at the head<br>\
whereof is a knob (كُعْبُرَةٌ): it is also, he adds,<br>\
the name of the gum that comes forth at the roots<br>\
of the leaves of that reed, or cane: the people of<br>\
the part above mentioned, he says, cook the plant<br>\
thus called, and eat it; and it is not a plant that<br>\
remains during the winter. (TA.) In the T, Az<br>\
states that حلتيت is said, on the authority of Lth,<br>\
to be the same as انجرد [app. a mistake for أَنْجُرَة;<br>\
or for أَنْجِزَد, from the Persian أَنْگِCَدْ, signifying<br>\
assa fœtida]; but, he adds, the word that I remember to have heard as the same as انجرد is<br>\
خلتيت, with خ; and I do not think it to be<br>\
genuine Arabic. (TA, here and in art. خلت.)<br>\
