there is good in him. (S, TA.) And Aboo-Shembel says, respecting Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee,<br>\
قَدْ كُنْتُ أَحْجُو أَبَا عَمْرٍوأَخَاثِقَةٍ<br>\

of the S, and in the K; but Freytag gives, as the<br>\

such and such in number; which is agreeable with<br>\
what follows;] and he thought them to be so. (S.)<br>\

inf. n. as above, (TA,) He kept a secret: (K:)<br>\
or he concealed it: (AZ, TA:) [and ↓ حَاجِى has<br>\
a similar meaning; for] you say, لَامُحَاجَاةَ عِنْدِى<br>\
فِى كَذَا, i. e. There is no concealment with me in<br>\
respect of such a thing; as also لا مُكَافَأَةَ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  لَا يَحْجُو إِبِلَهُ, said of a pastor, He does not,<br>\

namely, a thing; (S, K;) as also به ↓ تحجّى.<br>\

حَجَوَ, inf. n.<br>\
حَجًى [or حَجًا], (TK,) He was, or became attached to it, and clave to it; (Fr, S, K;) as also<br>\

(Fr, TA.) ↓ تحجّى also signifies He kept to the<br>\

(TA.) And بِهٰذَا المَكَانِ ↓ تَحَجَّيْتُ I preceded<br>\

aor.<br>\
حَجَوَ, (TA,) is also [said to be] syn. with عَدَا, (K,)<br>\
He ran; (TK;) thus bearing two contr. significations: (K:) but this requires consideration.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\

“ intelligence. ” (Har p. 9.) [And hence, I tried<br>\
him with an enigma or enigmas, and overcame<br>\
him therein: (see 6:) or] I proposed to him an<br>\
enigma [&amp;c.]: (T, TA:) [or I contended with him<br>\
in proposing an enigma or enigmas, &amp;c.]: i. e.<br>\
دَاعَيْتُهُ فَغَلَبْتُهُ: (S:) so in the handwriting of<br>\
Aboo-Zekereeyà, and in that of Aboo-Sahl, [and<br>\
in my two copies of the S,] but in [some of the<br>\
copies of] the S دعيته. (TA.) And حُوجِىَ بِهِ<br>\
[He was tried with it as an enigma to be explained by him; or he had it proposed to him as<br>\
an enigma]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مُحَاجَاةٌ signifies [also]<br>\
The asking a thing of one much, so as to weary;<br>\
as also مُدَاعَاةٌ. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And حِجَآءٌ, (K, TA,)<br>\
[accord. to the CK حَجًا, but correctly] like<br>\
كِتَابٌ, (TA,) An engaging in conflict, or fight.<br>\
(K, TA.) ―<br>\

تَحَاجَوْا They tried one another with enigmas:<br>\
[or proposed enigmas, one to another: or contended, one with another, in proposing an enigma,<br>\
or enigmas: (see 3:)] from حِجًى [or حِجًا]<br>\
meaning “ intelligence. ” (Har p. 189.) You say,<br>\
يَتَحَاجَوْنَ بِأُحْجِيَّةٍ [They try one another with an<br>\
enigma: or contend, one with another, in proposing an enigma]: (S, TA:) التَّحَاجِى signifying<br>\
التَّدَاعِى. (TA.)<br>\

that with which he was tried as an enigma to be<br>\
explained by him. (TA.)<br>\
حَجًا or حَجًى A side, region, quarter, or<br>\

(TA:) pl. أَحَجَآءٌ. (S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A refuge; a<br>\

in the Mgh and TA.]<br>\
-A2-  Bubbles upon water,<br>\
arising from the drops of rain: pl. [or rather<br>\
coll. gen. n.] of ↓ حَجَاةٌ: (S, K: [in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, حِجاة:]) the latter word, which is<br>\
like حَصَاةٌ, is explained by Az as signifying a<br>\
bubble that rises upon water, like a flask; and as<br>\
having for its pl. حَجَوَاتٌ: and the same word<br>\
(حجاة) signifies also a pool of water, itself, such<br>\
as is left by a torrent. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also حَجِىٌّ.<br>\
-A4-  حَجَا is also used, by poetic license, for حَجَاج,<br>\
q. v. (TA in art. حج.)<br>\
حَجٍ: see حَجِىٌّ.<br>\
-A2-  إِنَّهُ لَحَجِىٌ إِلَى بَنِى فُلَانٍ<br>\
means لَا جِئٌ لَهُمْ [i. e. Verily he is betaking himself for refuge, or protection, to the sons of such<br>\
a one; like لَحَجِئٌ: but by rule it should be<br>\
لَحَجٍ; and thus, perhaps, it is correctly written].<br>\
(AZ, TA.)<br>\
حِجًا or حِجًى Intelligence, or understanding;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) sagacity, or skill and knowledge:<br>\
(K:) [said to be] from حَجَا meaning “ he, or it,<br>\
prevented, or withheld; ” because it prevents, or<br>\
withholds, a man from doing that which is bad,<br>\
or corrupt. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And i. q. مِقْدَارٌ [Quantity,<br>\
measure, &amp;c.]: pl. أَحْجَآءٌ. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  See also حَجًا.<br>\
-A4-  [Also said by Golius, as on the authority of<br>\
J, to signify “ an enigma,” as though syn. with<br>\
أُحْجِيَّةٌ; but I have not found it in this sense in<br>\
any copy of the S, nor in any other lexicon.]<br>\
حَجَاةٌ: see حَجًا.<br>\
حَجْوَى a subst. signifying مُحَاجَاةٌ [i. e. A<br>\
contention in intelligence &amp;c.; and particularly,<br>\
in trying with an enigma or enigmas; in proposing an enigma or enigmas; or simply the<br>\
proposal of an enigma; see 3]; (T, TA;) the<br>\
subst. denoted by حَاجَيْتُهُ فَحَجَوْتُهُ; (K;) [or<br>\
rather by the verb حَاجَيْتُ, agreeably with the<br>\
foregoing explanation from the T;] as also ↓ حُجَيَّا,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) with a dammeh, (K, TA,) and with<br>\
teshdeed of the ى; (TA; [in some copies of the<br>\
K erroneously written حُجْيُا;]) and ↓ أُحْجِيَّةٌ:<br>\
(S:) or ↓ حُجَيًّا is the dim. of حَجْوَى: (T, TA:)<br>\
and ↓ أُحْجِيَّةٌ signifies a saying of which the meaning differs from the letter, as also ↓ أُحْجُوَّةٌ, (K,)<br>\
but احجيّة is preferable, (T, TA,) and كَلِمَةٌ<br>\
↓ مُحْجِيَةٌ, (K,) like مُحْسِنَةٌ; (TA; [in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, مُحْجِيَّةٌ;]) [i. e.] ↓ أُحْجِيَّةٌ signifies<br>\
an enigma; a riddle; (MA, PS, TK;) and so<br>\
↓ حُجَيَّا; (PS;) or a question put to one with the<br>\
view of causing him to make a mistake; (TA;)<br>\
and is from حِجًى [or حِجًا] meaning “ intelligence,” because مُحَاجَاةٌ is like a vying, or contending, in intelligence: (Har p. 9:) the pl. of<br>\
↓ أُحْجِيَّةٌ is أَحَاجِىُّ and أَحَاجٍ, (MA, and Har ubi<br>\
suprà,) agreeably with a general rule relating to<br>\
words of its measure, as أُثْفِيَّةٌ and أُمْنِيَّةٌ. (Seer,<br>\
in Har ubi suprà.) One says, مَاكَانَ ↓ حُجَيَّاكَ<br>\
كَذَا وَكَذَا [The question of contention with thee<br>\
in trying thine intelligence by an enigma, or the<br>\
enigma proposed to thee, is, What is, or was,<br>\
such a thing, and such a thing?]: it means a<br>\
certain game, and a question put with the view of<br>\
causing one to make a mistake: A &#39;Obeyd says,<br>\
It is like their saying, Disclose what is in my<br>\
hand, and thou shalt have such a thing. (S.)<br>\
One says also, فِى هٰذَا ↓ أَنَا حُجَيَّاكَ, meaning مَنْ<br>\
يُحَاجِيكَ [i. e. I am he who contends with thee in<br>\
intelligence, or in trying with an enigma, &amp;c.,<br>\
respecting this thing]. (S.) And ↓ بَيْنَهُمْ أُحْجِيَّةٌ<br>\
يَتَحَاجَونَ بِهَا [Between them is a contention in<br>\
intelligence, or in proposing enigmas, or between<br>\
them is an enigma, with which they try one another]. (S.)<br>\
هُوَحَجِىٌّ بِهِ He is adapted, disposed, apt,<br>\
meet, suited, suitable, fitted, fit, competent, or<br>\
proper, for it; or worthy of it; as also ↓ حَجٍ,<br>\
(S, M, K, TA,) of which the pl. is حَجُونَ; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓ حَجًى, (S, M, K, TA,) which last has no<br>\
fem. nor dual nor pl. form, (S, M,) retaining the<br>\
same form as fem. and dual and pl.: (M:) and<br>\
in like manner you say, أَنْ يَفْعَلَ ذٰلِكَ ↓ إِنَّهُ لَمَحْجَاةٌ<br>\
Verily he is adapted, &amp;c., to do that; (S, K; *) and<br>\
إِنَّهَا لَمَحْجَاةٌ; and إِنَّهُمْ لَمَحْجَاةٌ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  حَجِىٌّ is<br>\
also syn. with حَرِيصٌ [Vehemently desirous, eager,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (KL.)<br>\
حُجَيَّا: see حَجْوَى, in five places.<br>\
-A2-  Respecting<br>\
this word in the phrase حثجْ حُجَيَّاكَ, see حَاجَةٌ (in<br>\
art. حوج), near the end of the paragraph.<br>\
أحْجَى More, and most, adapted, disposed, apt,<br>\
meet, suited, suitable, fitted, fit, competent, proper,<br>\
or worthy: (TA, Ham p. 523:) so in the saying,<br>\
هُوَ أَحْجَى أَنْ يَكُونَ كَذَا [He is more, or most,<br>\
adapted, &amp;c., to be thus; or worthy of being<br>\
thus]: (TA:) and فُلَانٌ أَحْجَى بِكَذَا [Such a one<br>\
is more, or most, adapted, &amp;c., for such a thing;<br>\
or worthy of it]. (Ham ubi suprà.) Hence, in<br>\
a trad., مَعَاشِرُ هَمْدَانَ أَحْجَى حَىٍّ بِالكُوفَةِ [The<br>\
companies of Hemdán are the most worthy tribe<br>\
in El-Koofeh]: or, as some say, the meaning is,<br>\
the most intelligent tribe. (TA.)<br>\
