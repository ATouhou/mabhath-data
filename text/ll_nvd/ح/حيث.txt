with damm for its termination, (S, Msb, Mughnee,) as being likened to final words [such as<br>\
قَبْلُ and بَعْدُ ending a proposition], (S, Mughnee,)<br>\
because it does not [regularly] occur otherwise<br>\
than prefixed to a proposition, (S,) for the being<br>\
prefixed to a proposition is like the not being prefixed to anything, as the consequence of being<br>\
prefixed, which is the sign of the gen. case, is not<br>\
apparent: (Mughnee:) and حَيْثَ, (S, Mughnee,<br>\
K,) also indecl., (S,) with fet-h, (S, Mughnee,)<br>\
to render the pronunciation more easy, (Mughnee,)<br>\
because damm with ى is deemed difficult to pronounce: (S:) and حَيْثِ, (Mughnee, K,) with<br>\
kesr, accord. to the general rule observed to<br>\
prevent the concurrence of two quiescent letters:<br>\
(Mughnee:) and in like manner, حَوْثُ and حَوْثَ<br>\
and حَوْثِ: (Mughnee, TA:) of which forms,<br>\
حوث is asserted to be the original; (L;) though<br>\
حَيْثُ is more chaste than حَوْثُ, and is the form<br>\
used in the Kur-án: (Az and TA in art. حوث:)<br>\
but some of the Arabs make حيث decl.: (Mughnee:) it is an adverbial noun of place, (S, Msb,)<br>\
a vague adverbial noun of place, (L,) [signifying<br>\
Where,] like حِينَ with respect to time: (S, K:)<br>\
or it is a denotative of place, by general consent:<br>\
but accord. to Akh it sometimes occurs as denoting time, [signifying when,] as in the following<br>\
verse, (Mughnee, TA,) which is the strongest<br>\
evidence of its use in this sense: (TA:)<br>\
حَيْثَمَا تَسْتَقِمْ يُقَدِّرْ لَكَ اللّٰ<br>\
هُ نَجَاحًا فِى غَابِرِ الأَزْمَانِ<br>\
[Whenever thou shalt pursue a right course, God<br>\
will decree thee success in the time to come]:<br>\
(Mughnee, TA:) but in most instances it occupies<br>\
the place of an accus., as an adverbial noun of<br>\
place; or of a gen., governed by مِنْ, and sometimes by another prep., as in the saying (of Zuheyr,<br>\
TA in art. قشعم),<br>\
لَدَى حَيْثُ أَلْقَتْ رَحْلَهَاأُمُّ قَشْعَمِ<br>\
[At the place where Calamity, or Fate, has put<br>\
down her saddle, i. e., made her abode]: and<br>\
sometimes it occurs as an objective complement,<br>\
as it is said to do in اَللّٰهُ أَعْلَمُ حَيْثُ يَجْعَلُ رِسَالَاتِهِ<br>\
[in the Kur vi. 124], i. e. God is knowing: He<br>\
knows where to bestow his apostolic commissions;<br>\
يَعْلَمُ being suppressed, as implied by أَعْلَمُ; or<br>\
أَعْلَمُ may be rendered by عَالِمٌ, and so may govern the accus. case. (Mughnee.) Accord. to<br>\
rule, (Mughnee,) in every instance, (S, Mughnee,)<br>\
it is prefixed to a proposition, (S, Msb, Mughnee,)<br>\
nominal, or verbal, but in most cases the latter;<br>\
(Mughnee;) as in أَقُومُ حَيْثُ يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ [I will<br>\
stand where Zeyd shall stand]; and حَيْثُ تَكُونُ<br>\
أَكُونُ [Where thou shalt be, I will be]; (S;) and<br>\
جَلَسْتُ حَيْثُ زَيْدًا أَرَاهُ [I sat where I saw Zeyd],<br>\
the accus. case being preferred in an instance like<br>\
this; (Mughnee;) and اذْهَبْ حَيْثُ شئْتَ [Go thou<br>\
whither thou wilt.] (Msb in art. حَين.) You<br>\
should not say حَيْثُ زَيْدٌ [alone]: (S:) or it occurs prefixed to a single word in poetry; (Msb,<br>\
Mughnee;) as in the saying,<br>\
وَنَطْعُنُهُمْ تَحْتَ الكُلَى بَعْدَ ضَرْبِهِمْ<br>\
بِبِيضِ المَوَاضِى حَيْثُ لَىِّ العَمَائِمِ<br>\
[And we pierce them beneath the kidneys, after<br>\
smiting them, with the sharp swords, where the<br>\
turbans are wound]; (Mughnee;) but this is<br>\
irregular; (Msb, Mughnee;) though Ks holds it<br>\
to be regular. (Mughnee.) Lh relates, on the<br>\
authority of Ks, that some make حيث to govern<br>\
a noun in the gen. case, as in the saying,<br>\
أَمَا تَرَى حَيْثُ سُهَيْلٍ طَالِعَا<br>\
[Seest thou not where Canopus is, rising?]: but<br>\
he says that this is not of respectable authority:<br>\
(L:) some write حَيْثَ سُهَيْلٍ: and some, حَيْثُ<br>\
سُهَيْلٌ, [which is the common reading, سهيل being<br>\
an inchoative, and] the enunciative, مَوْجُودٌ, being<br>\
suppressed. (Mughnee.) Abu-l-Fet-h says that<br>\
he who prefixes حيث to a single word makes it<br>\
declinable. (Mughnee.) [Accord. to Fei,] BenooTemeem say حَيْثَ when it occupies the place of<br>\
an accus., as in the phrase, قُمْ حَيْثَ يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ<br>\
[Stand thou where Zeyd shall stand]. (Msb.)<br>\
Ks says, I have heard among Benoo-Temeem, of<br>\
Benoo-Yarbooa and Tuheiyeh, those who say<br>\
حَيْثَ in every case, when it occupies the place of<br>\
a gen., and that of an accus., and that of a nom.;<br>\
saying مِنْ حَيْثَ لَايَعْلَمُونَ [Whence they know<br>\
not], and حَيْثَ الْتَقَيْنَا [Where we met]: and he<br>\
says also, I have heard some of Benu-l-HárithIbn-Asad-Ibn-El-Hárith-Ibn-Thaalabeh, and all<br>\
Benoo-Fak&#39;as, say حَيْثِ when it occupies the<br>\
place of a gen., and حَيْثَ when it occupies the<br>\
place of an accus.; saying مِنْ حَيْثِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,<br>\
and حَيْثَ الْتَقَيْنَا. (L.) Sometimes the proposition<br>\
after حيث commences with إِنَّ, as in اِجْلِسْ حَيْثُ<br>\
إِنَّ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ [Sit thou where Zeyd is sitting].<br>\
(K in art. أن, and IAk p. 92.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It sometimes<br>\
comprises the meanings of two adverbial nouns of<br>\
place, as when you say, حَيْثُ عَبْدُ اللّٰهِ قَاعِدٌ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ<br>\
[Where&#39; Abd-Allah is sitting, there Zeyd is standing]. (AHeyth, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The restrictive مَا (مَا<br>\
كَافَّةٌ) is sometimes affixed to it, and in this case<br>\
it implies a conditional meaning, [signifying<br>\
Wherever, or wheresoever, and, accord. to Akh,<br>\
whenever, or whensoever,] (Mughnee, TA,) and<br>\
renders two verbs mejzoom, (Mughnee,) as in the<br>\
saying, حَيْثُمَا تَجْلِسْ أَجْلِسْ [Wherever thou shalt<br>\
sit, I will sit], (S,) and in the first of the verses<br>\
cited above: (Mughnee, TA:) it is not [properly,<br>\
though it is sometimes improperly,] used as a<br>\
conditional without ما. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [It is also used,<br>\
in scientific and other post-classical works, in<br>\
senses different from those explained above.<br>\
Thus, مِنْ حَيْثُ is used to signify As to, or in respect of: so in the phrase مِنْ حَيْثُ اللَّفْظِ وَالمَعْنَى<br>\
As to, or in respect of, the word and the meaning.<br>\
Also As, or considered as, absolutely, or abstractedly: so in the phrase مِنْ حَيْثُ هُوَ, or مِنْ<br>\
حَيْثُ هُوَ هُوَ, As, or considered as, such, absolutely, or abstractedly; and الإِنْسَانُ مِنْ حَيْثُ هُوَ<br>\
إِنْسَانٌ Man, as, or considered as, man, absolutely,<br>\
or abstractedly. And As, meaning considered<br>\
merely or only or simply as: so in the saying,<br>\
الإِنْسَانُ مِنْ حَيْثُ إِنَّهُ يَصِحُّ وَتَزُولُ عَنْهُ السِّحَّةُ<br>\
مَوْضُوعُ الطِّبِّ Man, as, or considered merely or<br>\
only or simply as, being healthy and ceasing to be<br>\
healthy, is the object of therapeutics. And As,<br>\
meaning since, or because: so in the saying,<br>\
النَّارُ مِنْ حَيْثُ إِنَّهَا حَارَّةٌ تُسَخِّنُ المَآءَ Fire, as, or<br>\
since, or because, it is hot, heats water. بِحَيْثُ<br>\
is also vulgarly used in this sense. And correctly as<br>\
meaning So that; so as that; in such a state, or<br>\
condition, that: often syn. with حَتَّى.]<br>\
