حَسڤ3َحَسَّ, (first pers. حَسِسْتُ, or حَسَسْتُ, and<br>\
حَسِيتُ, and حَسَيْتُ, and حَسْتُ,) as syn. with<br>\
أَحَسَّ: see 4, throughout. ―<br>\
-b2-  حَسَّ لَهُ, first pers.<br>\
حَسَسْتُ, aor.<br>\
حَسِ3َ; (S, K;) and first pers. حَسِسْتُ,<br>\
[aor.<br>\
حَسَ3َ;] (Yaakoob, S, K;) inf. n. حِسٌّ (S, K)<br>\
and حَسٌّ, (K,) or the latter is inf. n. of both verbs,<br>\
but the former is a simple subst., (TA,) He was,<br>\
or became, tender, or compassionate, towards<br>\
him: (S, K:) [lit., he felt for him:] ISd says<br>\
that, for رَقَقْتُ لَهُ, the explanation of حسستُ له,<br>\
he found in the book of Kr the verb written with<br>\
ف and ق; but that the former [?] is the right:<br>\
(TA:) or he lamented for him; (Aboo-Málik,<br>\
TA;) as also لَهُ ↓ حَسْحَسَ. (K, * TA.) The Arabs<br>\
say, إِنَّ العَامِرِىَّ لَيَحِسُّ لِلسَّعْدِىِّ Verily the &#39;Ámiree<br>\
is tender, or compassionate, towards the Saadee;<br>\
because of the relationship that subsists between<br>\
them. (TA.) And Abu-l-Jarráh El-&#39;Okeylee<br>\
said, مَارَأَيْتُ عُقَيْلِيًّا إِلَّا حَسَسْتُ لَهُ I have not seen<br>\
an &#39;Okeylee without my feeling tenderness, or<br>\
compassion, towards him; (S, TA;) for the same<br>\
reason. (TA.) [See حَاسَّةٌ, second signification.]<br>\
-A2-  حَسَّهُ, [aor.<br>\
حَسُ3َ, inf. n. حَسٌّ,] He made his حِسّ<br>\
[i. e. sound, or motion,] to cease. (Bd in iii. 145.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (Bd, ubi suprà,) حَسَّهُمْ, aor.<br>\
حَسُ3َ, (S,<br>\
A, Bd, Msb,) inf. n. حَسٌّ, (Msb, K,) [and app.,<br>\
accord. to Fr, حِسٌّ, or this may be a simple subst.,]<br>\
He slew them: (Bd, Msb, K:) and extirpated<br>\
them: (K:) or he slew them quickly: (A, TA:)<br>\
or he extirpated them by slaughter: (Aboo-Is-hák,<br>\
S:) or he slew them with a quick and extirpating<br>\
slaughter: or with a vehement slaughter: (TA:)<br>\
it occurs in the Kur iii. 145: (S, A:) accord. to<br>\
Fr, حِسٌّ, [so in the TA,] in this instance, is the<br>\
act of slaying and destroying. (TA.) [Hence,<br>\
حُسَّ app. signifies It was utterly destroyed, so<br>\
that nothing was left in the place thereof; and so<br>\
↓ احتسّ; for it is said that] حِسٌّ and اِحْتِسَاسٌ,<br>\
with respect to anything, signify أَنْ لَا يُتْرَكَ فِى<br>\
المَكَانِ شَىْءٌ. (TA.) Also حَسَّهُمْ, aor. as above,<br>\
He trod them under foot, and despised them.<br>\
(TA.) And حَسَّ البَرْدُ الجَرَادَ The cold killed the<br>\
locusts. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] الجَرَادُ تَحُسُّ الأَرْضَ The<br>\
locusts eat the herbage of the land. (TA.) And<br>\
حَسَّ البَرْدُ الكَلَأَ, (S, K,) or الزَّرْعَ, (A,) aor.<br>\
حَسُ3َ, (S,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. حَسٌّ, (TA,) (tropical:)  The cold nipped, shrunk,<br>\
shrivelled, or blasted, (lit., burned, أَحْرَقَ, q. v.,)<br>\
the herbage, (S, K,) or the seed-produce. (A.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
حَسَّ الدَّابَّةَ, (S, TA,) or حَسَّهَا بِالمِحَسَّةِ, (A,) aor.<br>\
حَسُ3َ,<br>\
(S,) inf. n. حَسٌّ, (S, K,) (tropical:)  He curried the beast;<br>\
removed the dust from it with the مِحَسَّة. (S, A, K,<br>\
TA.) [See a proverb, voce حَشَّ.] Hence the saying of Zeyd Ibn-Soohán, on the day of the battle of<br>\
the Camel, when he was carried off from the field,<br>\
about to die, اِدْفِنُونِى فِى ثِيَابِى وَلَا تَحُسُّوا عَنِّى تُرَابًا<br>\
(tropical:)  [Bury ye me in my clothes, and] shake not off<br>\
any dust from me. (S, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
حَسَّسْتُ الشَّىْءَ [a mistake in the CK for<br>\
حَسَسْتُ]: see 4.<br>\
4<br>\
احسّ الشَّىْءَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِحْسَاسٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) He perceived, or became sensible of, (وَجَدَ,)<br>\
the حِسّ (i. e. motion or sound, TA) of the thing:<br>\
(S, K, TA:) he knew the thing by means of [any<br>\
of] the senses: (IAth, accord. to his explanation<br>\
of الإِحْسَاسُ as signifying العِلْمُ بِالحَوَاسِّ:) he ascertained the thing as one ascertains a thing that<br>\
is perceived by the senses: (Bd in iii. 45:) he knew<br>\
the thing; or he perceived it by means of any of the<br>\
senses; syn. عَلِمَ بِهِ, (Msb,) and عَلِمَهُ, and عَرَفَهُ,<br>\
and شَعَرَ بِهِ; (TA;) as also ↓ حَسَّهُ, aor.<br>\
حَسُ3َ, inf. n.<br>\
حَسٌّ and حِسٌّ and حَسِيسٌ; (TA, in explanation<br>\
of the saying in the K that حَسَسْتُ الشَّىْءَ [in the<br>\
CK erroneously ↓ حَسَّسْتُ] signifies the same as<br>\
أَحْسَسْتُهُ;) and in like manner احسّ بِهِ is syn.<br>\
with شَعَرَ بِهِ; (L, Msb;) and so is بِهِ ↓ حَسَّ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
حَسُ3َ, inf. n. حِسٌّ (L, Msb) and حَسٌّ and حَسِيسٌ;<br>\
(L;) or حِسٌّ is a simple subst.: (M, L:) accord.<br>\
to Fr, إِحْسَاسٌ is syn. with وُجُودٌ; and Zj says that<br>\
the meaning of احسّ is عَلِمَ and وَجَدَ: (TA:) or<br>\
احسّ signifies he perceived, or became sensible of;<br>\
syn. وَجَدَ: and he thought, or opined: (Akh, S,<br>\
K:) and he saw; syn. أَبْصَرَ: and he knew: (K:)<br>\
and is trans. in these senses by itself, (Akh, S,)<br>\
or by means of بِ: (TA:) and أَحْسَسْتُ بِهِ signifies I knew it certainly; was certain, or sure,<br>\
of it; (S;) as also به ↓ حَسِسْتُ, (S, K,) with<br>\
kesr; (K;) speaking of news, or tidings: (S:)<br>\
and for أَحْسَسْتُ, some say أَحْسَيْتُ, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
changing the [second] س into ى; (S, Msb;)<br>\
and أَحَسْتُ, (T, S, L, K,) with a single س, which<br>\
is an extr. kind of contraction, (S, K,) but made<br>\
in all other similar cases, where the last radical<br>\
letter is quiescent; (Sb, L, TA;) and [thus] for<br>\
أَحْسَسْنَ, we find أَحَسْنَ; (S;) and in like manner, for ↓ حَسِسْتُ, (S, K,) or ↓ حَسَسْتُ, (Msb,)<br>\
some say حَسِيتُ, (T, S, M, L,) and حَسَّيْتُ, (M,<br>\
L, Msb, K, [in the CK حَسْتُ, which is the<br>\
modern vulgar form,]) and حَسْتُ. (Abu-l-Hasan,<br>\
IAar, T, M, L.) You say, احسّهُ بِعَيْنِهِ [He perceived him, or it, with his eye]; (Ibn-Zekereeyà,<br>\
TA in art. جس;) and so ↓ حَسَّهُ. (Sgh, TA ibid.)<br>\
[In the present art. in the TA, it is said that<br>\
حَسَّهُ بالنصل is syn. with أَحَسَّهُ: but بالنّصل is evidently a mistranscription for بِالبَصَرِ.] And it is<br>\
said in the Kur [iii. 45], فَلَمَّا أَحَسَّ عِيسَى مِنْهُمُ<br>\
الكُفْرَ And when Jesus ascertained their unbelief<br>\
as one ascertains a thing that is perceived by the<br>\
senses: (Bd:) or opined it; or perceived it, or<br>\
became sensible of it: (Akh, S:) or saw it: (Lh,<br>\
TA:) or knew it, or perceived it sensibly. (Msb.)<br>\
And in the same [xix. last verse], هَلْ تُحِسُّ مِنْهُمْ<br>\
مِنْ أَحَدٍ Dost thou see of them any one? (TA.)<br>\
You say also, هَلْ أَحْسَسْتَ الخَبَرَ Hast thou known<br>\
the news? (TA.) And أَحْسَسْتُ بِالخَبَرِ, and<br>\
أَحْسَيْتُ بِهِ, and به ↓ حَسِسْتُ, and حَسِيتُ به, I<br>\
knew the news certainly. (S.) And أَحْسَسْتُ الخَبَرَ,<br>\
and أَحَسْتُهُ, and ↓ حَسِيتُهُ, and حَسْتُهُ, I knew somewhat of the news. (T, L, TA.) And مَا أَحْسَسْتُ<br>\
بِاخَبَرِ, and اَحَسْتُ بِه. مَا, and به ↓ ما حَسِيتُ, and<br>\
ما حَسْتُ, I knew not aught of the news. (T,<br>\
L, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تحسّس He listened to the discourse of<br>\
people: (El-Harbee, K:) accord. to Aboo-Mo&#39;ádh,<br>\
it is (??) to تَسَمَّعَ and تَبَصَّرَ: (TA:) or he<br>\
sought repeatedly, or time after time, to know a<br>\
thing, by the sense (الحاسة) [of hearing &amp;c.]:<br>\
(Har p. 678:) or (so accord. to the TA, but in<br>\
the K “ and,”) he sought after, (Msb, K.) or sought<br>\
after repeatedly, or time after time, (Msb,) news,<br>\
or tidings, of a people, in a good cause; (K;)<br>\
تجسّس signifying the doing the same in an evil<br>\
cause: A&#39;Obeyd says, you say, تَحَسَّسْتُ الخَبَرَ<br>\
and تَجَسَّسْتُهُ; and Sh says that تَنَدَّسْتُهُ is similar<br>\
to it; and IAar, that تَحَسَّسْتُ الخَبَرَ and تَبَجَّسْتُهُ<br>\
[but this is app. a mistranscription for تَبَحَّثْتُهُ]<br>\
signify the same. (TA.) You say also, تحسّس<br>\
مِنَ الشَّيْءِ He asked, or inquired, after news, or<br>\
tidings, of the thing. (S, TA.) And تحسّس فُلَانًا,<br>\
and مِنْ فُلَانٍ, He inquired, or sought for information, respecting such a one; as also تجسّس:<br>\
or the former signifies he sought after him for<br>\
himself; and the latter, “he sought after him for<br>\
another. ” (TA, art. جس.) The passage in which<br>\
it occurs in the Kur xii. 87, has been differently<br>\
interpreted, accord. to the several explanations<br>\
here given. (TA.)<br>\

انحسّ (assumed tropical:)  It became pulled out or up or off;<br>\
became eradicated, or displaced; fell, or came,<br>\
out; syn. اِنْقَلَعَ: (S, K:) it fell; fell off; or<br>\
fell continuously, by degrees, or one part after<br>\
another; syn. تَحَاتَّ, (S, K,) and تَسَاقَطَ: (A,<br>\

a dial. var. of انْحَتَّ. (TA.) You say, انحسّت<br>\
أَسْنَانُهُ (S, TA) (tropical:)  His teeth fell, or came, out,<br>\
(انقلعت,) and broke in pieces. (TA.) And<br>\
اِنحسّ شَعَرُهُ (tropical:)  His hair fell off continuously. (A.)<br>\
And in like manner, أَوْبَارُ الإِبِلِ ↓ تَحَسَّسَتْ, (TA,)<br>\
and ↓ تَحَسْحَسَتْ, (K, TA,) (tropical:)  The fur of the camels<br>\
fell off continuously, and became scattered. (K, *<br>\
TA.)<br>\

weeping, and such as that of a lute; syn. رَنَّهٌ:<br>\
(TA:) or ↓ حَسِيسٌ, [or both,] the sound by which<br>\
a thing is perceived: (Bd in xxi. 102:) and the<br>\
former, motion: (K:) and the passing of anything<br>\
near by one, so that he hears it without seeing it;<br>\
as also ↓ حَسِيسٌ. (K TA.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[xxi. 102], ↓ لَا يَسْمَعُونَ حَسِيسَهَا They shall not<br>\
hear its low sound: (S:) [meaning, that of hellfire:] or the sound by which it shall be perceived:<br>\
(Bd:) or the motion of its flaming. (TA.) And<br>\
in a trad., فَسَمِعَ حِسَّ حَيَّةٍ And he heard the motion, and the sound of the passing along, of a<br>\

حَسَاسٌ, with fet-h, Perception by means of any<br>\

proverb, لَا حَسَاسَ مِنِ ابْنَىْ مَوْقِدٍ [There is no<br>\
perceiving of the two sons of the place of the kindling of fire]: (L, TA:) for they say that two men<br>\
used to kindle a fire in a road, and, when people<br>\
passed by them, to entertain them as guests; and<br>\
a party passing by when they had gone, a man<br>\
said these words. (L.) And hence the saying,<br>\
