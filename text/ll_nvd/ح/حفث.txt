certain portion or appertenance] of the stomach<br>\
of a ruminant animal, that which has طَرَائِق<br>\
[meaning either furrows or streaks, but more<br>\
probably the former], as though it, or they,<br>\
(كَأَنَّهَا,) were the coverings (أَطْبَاق) of the feces<br>\
in the stomach: (Az, L:) or that [part] which<br>\
has coverings (أَطْبَاق [or probably this signifies<br>\
here folds, one above another,]) at the lower part<br>\
of the stomach of a ruminant, towards the side<br>\
of the latter, from which the feces of the stomach<br>\
never pass forth: [app. meaning the third stomach,<br>\
or omasum; commonly called the manyplies,<br>\
because of its many plies, or folds, and strata<br>\
super strata; and by some, the millet; from<br>\
which the food, being already ruminated, does<br>\
not pass out again to the mouth, as it does from<br>\
the first and second stomachs:] it pertains to the<br>\
camel, and to the sheep and goat, and oxen; or,<br>\
accord. to IAar, [only] to the sheep and goat:<br>\
(L:) the حَفث of the stomach of a ruminant;<br>\
(S;) i. q. قِبَةٌ, (S, K,) or قِبَةٌ: (TA:) or that<br>\
which is with the stomach of a ruminant, and<br>\
which resembles it: (T, TA:) or that which has<br>\
طَرَائِق, by the side of which is the قبة, another<br>\
thing, which has not طرائق: it is called حَفِثٌ<br>\
and حَثِفٌ and حِفْثٌ and حِثْفٌ and فَحِثٌ and, as<br>\
some say, فِثْحٌ and ثِحْفٌ: (AA, TA:) pl. أَحْفَاثٌ.<br>\

serpent, resembling a جِرَاب [or traveller&#39;s provision-bag]. (K.)<br>\
حَفِثَةٌ: see above.<br>\
حَفَاثِيَةٌ Big, bulky, or corpulent. (K.)<br>\
حُفَّاثٌ A certain kind of serpent, that blows,<br>\
but does not hurt: (S:) a kind of serpent larger<br>\
than that called حَفِثٌ, (K, TA,) speckled with<br>\
black and white, party-coloured; that eats herbs,<br>\
or dry pasture, and threatens, but does not hurt<br>\
any one: (TA:) or, accord. to Sh, a bulky<br>\
serpent, with a large head, red, speckled with<br>\
white and black, resembling that called الأَسْوَدُ,<br>\
but not the same as this latter; if one irritate<br>\
it, its jugular vein becomes distended: accord.<br>\
to ISh, it is larger than that called الأَرْقَمُ, but<br>\
is speckled with black and white in the same<br>\
manner as this latter: pl. حَفَافِيثُ. (Az, TA.)<br>\
[Hence,] اِحْرَنْفَشَ حُفَّاثُهُ (tropical:)  His external jugular<br>\
veins (أَوْدَاجُهُ [likened to serpents]) became distended by rage, or anger. (TA.)<br>\
