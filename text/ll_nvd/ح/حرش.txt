حَرَشَ الضَّبَّ, (S, A, K,) aor.<br>\
حَرِشَ, inf. n. حَرْشٌ<br>\
(S, K) and تَحْرَاشٌ, (K,) He hunted, or sought<br>\
to capture or catch, or captured or caught, the<br>\
[lizard called] ضبّ; syn. صَادَهُ; (S, A, K;) by<br>\
moving about his hand at its hole, (S, K,) at<br>\
the entrance thereof, (K,) in order that it might<br>\
imagine it to be a serpent, and put forth its tail<br>\
to strike it, whereupon he would seize it; (S, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ احترشهُ: (A, K:) or, as also ↓ احترشهُ,<br>\
and ↓ تحرّشهُ, and بِهِ ↓ تحرّش, he traced its hole,<br>\
and made a noise with his staff, or stick, at it,<br>\
and inserted the end of this into the hole, and<br>\
the ضبّ, hearing the sound, thought it to be a<br>\
beast desiring to come in upon it, so it came<br>\
backwards upon its feet and kinder part, fighting, and striking with its tail, whereupon the<br>\
man hastened with it, and seized it firmly by its<br>\
tail, and it was unable to escape from him.<br>\
(TA.) And hence, He hunted, or sought to<br>\
capture, or captured, the ضبّ in any manner.<br>\
(Ham p. 61.) Hence also the saying, لَهُوَ أَخْبَثُ<br>\
مِنْ ضَبٍّ حَرَشْتَهُ [Verily he is worse than a ضبّ<br>\
which thou hast hunted]: for sometimes the ضبّ<br>\
scents [its pursuer], and circumvents [him], and<br>\
cannot be caught. (TA.) And hence the prov.,<br>\
alluding to one&#39;s discoursing to a learned man<br>\
with the desire of instructing him, أَتُعْلِمُنِى بِضَبٍّ<br>\
أَنَا حَرَشْتُهُ [Dost thou acquaint me with a ضبّ<br>\
which I have captured?]. (A &#39;Obeyd, Az.) Hence<br>\
also the prov., هٰذَاأَجَلُّ مِنَ الحَرْشِ [This is a<br>\
greater matter than the hunting, or capturing, of<br>\
the ضبّ]: (M, A, K:) originating in one of<br>\
their fables, to the effect that a ضبّ said to its<br>\
young one, “O my little son, beware thou of<br>\
الحَرْش: ” and the young one heard, one day,<br>\
the fall of a digging-implement upon the mouth<br>\
of the hole; so he said, “O my father, is this<br>\
الحَرْش? ” to which his father answered, “O my<br>\
little son, this is a greater matter than الحَرْش: ”<br>\
(M, K: *) and it became a prov., which is applied<br>\
to him who fears a thing and falls into that which<br>\
is more severe. (M.) [Hence also the saying,]<br>\
ضَبَّ العَدَاوَةِ بَيْنَهُمْ ↓ اِحْتَرَشَ (tropical:)  [He roused the<br>\
rancour of enmity between them]. (TA.) ―<br>\

scab], signifying having small pustules, (S,) not<br>\
smeared [with tar]. (S, A.)<br>\
