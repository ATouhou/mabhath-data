every portion. (K, * TA.) [See حُطَامٌ.]<br>\

crushing them, or bruising them, by reason of his<br>\
vehement driving; but it is used by way of comparison, as meaning (tropical:)  cunning and versatile. (TA.)<br>\

the ungentle, who causes the beasts to crush, or<br>\

or such as are heavy and wide: (K:) the first of<br>\
which explanations is the most probable. (TA.)<br>\
حُطَامٌ What is broken in pieces, of a thing that<br>\
is dry, or tough. (S, K. [In the CK, by the accidental omission of وَ كَغُرَابٍ, this signification<br>\
and the next here following, from the K, are assigned to صَعْدَةٌ حِطَمٌ. See حِطْمَةٌ, which, accord.<br>\
to some copies of the K, is syn. with حُطَامٌ in the<br>\
sense explained above.]) And Fragments of eggs;<br>\

said in the M to be of the part next the spout; and<br>\
in the T, to be that in [or rather over] which is the<br>\
spout: so called because it was left broken when<br>\
the House was raised: or because the Arabs used<br>\
to throw in it, or upon it, the clothes in which<br>\
they performed their circuitings, and it remained<br>\
until it became broken by length of time: (TA:)<br>\
or the wall of the حِجْر of the Kaabeh; (I&#39; Ab,<br>\
S, K;) the wall over which is the spout of the<br>\
Kaabeh; (Ham p. 710;) the wall that [partly]<br>\
encloses the حِجْر of the Kaabeh, on the western<br>\
[or rather north-western] side: (Har p. 389:) or<br>\
the part between the angle [of the Black Stone]<br>\

the pagans used to confederate. (K.)<br>\

-b2-  Also (tropical:)  A digestive;<br>\
syn. هَاضُومٌ. (K, TA. [In the CK, erroneously,<br>\
حاضوم.]) It is implied in the K that this is also<br>\
a signification of حَطْمَةٌ and حُطْمَةٌ; which it is<br>\
not. (TA.) One says, نِعْمَ حَاطُومُ الطَّعَامِ البِطِّيخُ<br>\

food, the melon, or water-melon]. (A, TA.)<br>\
