حَبَكَهُ, aor.<br>\
حَبِكَ (S, K) and<br>\
حَبُكَ, (K,) inf. n. حَبْكٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) He bound it, or tied it; and made it fast,<br>\
or firm: (K: [see also 2:]) he made it well:<br>\
(TA:) he wove it well, (S, K, TA,) and firmly,<br>\
or compactly; (TA;) namely, a piece of cloth:<br>\
(S, K, TA:) he made the effect of the work<br>\
therein to be beautiful; i. e., in a piece of cloth:<br>\
and ↓ احتبكهُ signifies the same: (K:) or this<br>\
latter, he made it (i. e. anything) firm, or compact; and made it well. (IAar, S, Msb.) It is<br>\
said of &#39; Áïsheh, in a trad., تَحْتَ ↓ كَانَتْ تَحْتَبِكَ<br>\
الدِرْعِ فِى الصَّلَاةِ She used to bind the إِزَار [or<br>\
waist-wrapper], and make it fast, beneath the<br>\
shift, in prayer; (S;) from حُبْكَةٌ, q. v.: (TA:)<br>\
or بِإِزَارٍ فَوْقَ القَمِيصِ ↓ كَانَتْ فِى الصَّلَاةِ تَحْتَبِكُ<br>\
she used, in prayer, to bind an ازار over the shirt.<br>\
(Msb.) [It is said that] ↓ اِحْتِبَاكٌ is also syn.<br>\
with اِحْتِبَآءٌ, on the authority of As: (S:) [i. e.,<br>\
that] احتبك is syn. with احتبى: (Msb:) [and<br>\
that] احتبك بِإِزَارِهِ signifies احتبى, (K,) or احتبى<br>\
بِهِ وَ شَدَّهُ إِلَى يَدَيْهِ: so says Aboo-&#39; Obeyd, as on<br>\
the authority of As: but Az says that this is a<br>\
mistake: that what As said was, that الاحتياك,<br>\
with ى, is syn. with الاحتباء, as ISk relates.<br>\
(TA.) One says also, حَبَكْتُ الحَظِيرَةَ بِقَصَبَاتِ<br>\
كَمَ تُحْبَكُ عُرُوشُ الكَرْمِ بِالحِبَالِ [I bound the enclosure for cattle with canes, or reeds, (or perhaps<br>\
we should read بِقُضْبَانٍ, i. e. with twigs,) like<br>\
as the trellises of the grape-vine are bound with<br>\
cords: see also the last sentence of this paragraph]. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [In the present day, حَبَكَ<br>\
also signifies He sewed the leaves of a book: and<br>\
he bound a book.]<br>\
-A2-  حَبْكٌ also signifies The act<br>\
of cutting: and smiting [or severing] the neck.<br>\
(K.) One says, حَبَكَهُ بِالسَّيْفِ, aor.<br>\
حَبِكَ and<br>\
حَبُكَ,<br>\
inf. n. حَبْكٌ, (IAar, TA,) He struck him, or<br>\
smote him, upon his middle, or waist, with the<br>\
sword: or he cut the flesh [or his flesh] above<br>\
the bone [with the sword]: (TA:) or he smote<br>\
[or severed] his neck with the sword: or he smote<br>\
him with the sword. (IAar, TA.) And حَبَكَ<br>\
عُرُوشَ الكَرْمِ He cut the trellises of the grapevine. (TA. [But this has another meaning, explained above.])<br>\
2<br>\
حبّك, (A, TA,) inf. n. تَحْبِيكٌ, (Sh, K,)<br>\
He made firm, or fast, (Sh, A, K,) a knot.<br>\
(A, TA. [See also 1.])<br>\
-A2-  He striped, or wove<br>\
with stripes, (A, K,) a [garment of the kind<br>\
called] كِسَآء. (A, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تحبّك He bound, or tied, the حُبْكَة, i. e.<br>\
the حُجْزَة: [see حُبْكَة, below:] (K:) or i. q.<br>\
تَلَبَّبَ بِثِيَابِهِ [he raised, or tucked up, his clothes;<br>\

clothes; &amp;c.]. (IDrd, K.) And تحبّكع بِنِطَاقِهَا<br>\

ذَاتِ الحُبْكِ and الحِبْكِ and الحَبَكِ and الحُبَكِ<br>\
and الحُبُكِ and الحُبِكِ (TA) and الحِبَكِ (Bd in<br>\
li. 7] and الحِبُكِ and الحِبِكِ (TA) are various<br>\
readings in the Kur [li. 7]: الحُبْك is a contraction of الحُبُك, of the dial. of Benoo-Temeem:<br>\
الحِبْك is a contraction of الحِبِك: الحَبَك is as<br>\
though its sing., or n. un., were حَبَكَةٌ: الحُبَك is<br>\
as though its sing. were حُبْكَةٌ: الحُبُك is the<br>\
common reading, and is pl. of حِبَاكٌ [q. v.] or<br>\
of حَبِيكَةٌ: الحُبِك is of a form unused [in any<br>\
other instance]: (TA:) الحِبَك is like النِّعَم [as<br>\
though its sing. were حِبْكَةٌ]: (Bd:) الحِبُك is<br>\
affirmed to be a mixture of two dial. vars.:<br>\
الحِبِك is of a rare measure, like إِبِلٌ &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
حُبْكَةٌ i. q. حُجْزَةٌ [i. e. The part of the إِزَار (or<br>\
waist-wrapper) where it is tied round the waist;<br>\
which part is folded, or doubled]: (Sh, K:)<br>\
whence ↓ الاِحْتِبَاكُ, meaning “ the binding, or<br>\
tying, the ازار: ” or the folds of the حُجْزَة, let<br>\
down, before the wearer, for the purpose of his<br>\
carrying anything therein. (TA.) And An ازار<br>\
[itself]; as also ↓ حِبَاكٌ. (Ham p. 37.) And A<br>\
cord, or rope, which one binds on the waist:<br>\
(K:) and ↓ حِبَاكٌ [also] signifies a cord, or rope,<br>\
or an ازار, or other thing, with which the waist<br>\
is bound; pl. حُبُكٌ: whence the saying, عَقَدَ<br>\
فُلَانٌ حُبُكَ النِّطَاقِ, meaning (tropical:)  Such a one prepared<br>\
himself to go away; or applied himself exclusively and diligently to an affair. (Har p. 160.)<br>\
And The thong (القِدَّةُ [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
القِدَّةُ]) that connects the head to the [pieces of<br>\
wood called] غَرَاضِيف, of the [camel&#39;s saddle<br>\
called] قَتَب, (K, TA,) and of the [saddle called]<br>\
رَحْل; (TA;) as also ↓ حِبَاكٌ. (K.) Pl. (of the<br>\
former, TA) حُبَكٌ and (of the latter, TA)<br>\
حُبُكٌ. (K.)<br>\
حِبَاكٌ: see حُبْكَةٌ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also An<br>\
enclosure for cattle (حَظِيرَة), [made] with canes,<br>\
or reeds, (بِقَصَبَاتٍ, [or perhaps we should read<br>\
بِقُضْبَانٍ, i. e. with twigs,]) put crosswise, and then<br>\
bound, or tied: (Az, TA:) or pieces of wood put<br>\
together like a حَظِيرَة, and then bound in the<br>\
middle with a cord, or rope, that joins them<br>\
together. (Lth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The كِفَاف [i. e. selvages,<br>\
or the like,] of a garment, or piece of cloth.<br>\
(Z, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  The black threads with which are<br>\

the kind called] لِبْد. (Ibn-&#39; Abbád, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  A<br>\
streak, or line, (طَرِيقَةٌ,) in sand and the like;<br>\
as also ↓ حَبِيكَةٌ: pl. of the former حُبُكٌ; and of<br>\
the latter ↓ حَبَائِكٌ: (S:) or حُبُكً, the pl. of حِبَاكٌ,<br>\
signifies the ridges of sand [that are formed by<br>\
the wind]; (K;) the ripples (دَرَجَ) of sand, and<br>\
of water, when moved by the wind; pl. of حِبَاكٌ<br>\
and of ↓ حَبِيكَةٌ: (Az, TA:) [i. e.] حُبُكُ المَآءِ signifies المُتَكَسِّرُ مِنْهُ [the ripples of water]: and so<br>\
حُبُكُ الشَّعَرِ الجَعْدِ [the rimples, or wavy forms,<br>\
of crisp hair, appearing as though it were<br>\
crimped]: (K:) [and the like of other things:<br>\
this is what is meant by the following passage:]<br>\
Fr says, الحُبُكُ تَكَسُّرُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ كَالرَّمْلِ إِذَا مَرَّتْ<br>\
بِهِ الرِّيحُ السَّاكِنَةُ وَ المَآءِ القَائِمِ إِذَا مَرَّتْ بِهِ الرِّيحُ<br>\
وَ دِرْعُ الحَدِيدِ لَهَا حُبُكٌ أَيْضًا وَ الشَّعْرَةُ الجَعْدَةُ تَكَسُّرُهَا<br>\
حُبُكٌ: (S:) [respecting the حُبُك of a coat of mail,<br>\
here mentioned, see what follows: in like manner,]<br>\
↓ حَبِيكٌ (T, K) and ↓ حَبَائِكُ and حُبُكٌ, all as pls.<br>\
of ↓ حَبِيكَةٌ, [or rather ↓ حَبِيكٌ is a coll. gen. n.,]<br>\
signify the streaks of locks of hair; (K;) or of<br>\
a helmet; (T, K; [in the CK, البَيْضَةُ is erroneously put for البَيْضَةِ;]) and likewise of sand,<br>\
such as are made by the wind: (T, TA:) the<br>\
حُبُك of the sky, (S, K,) sing. ↓ حَبِيكَةٌ, (K,) are<br>\
the tracks of the stars: (S, K:) and ↓ حَبَائِكٌ<br>\
signifies also streaks, or tracks, in the sky: and<br>\
the heavens; because in them are the paths of<br>\
the stars: and حُبُكٌ, the streaks of a mountain:<br>\
(TA:) and حُبُكُ دِرْعٍ, the rows of rings of a coat<br>\
of mail: (TK in art. حرشف:) [in a passage in<br>\

scales of silver with which a coat of mail is ornamented; likened to the scales on the back of a<br>\
fish, by their being termed the حَرْشَفَ of a coat<br>\
of mail: (TA in art. حرشف:) and حِبَاكُ الحَمَامِ,<br>\
the blackness of the part above the wings of the<br>\
pigeon. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, A, K.) The phrase رَأْسُهُ<br>\
حُبُكٌ, in a description of Ed-Dejjál [or Antichrist], means The hair of his head is rimpled<br>\
(مُتَكَسِّرٌ) by reason of crispness; like stagnant<br>\
water, and sand, when the wind blows upon<br>\
them, and they in consequence thereof become<br>\
rippled (يَتَجَعَّدَانِ); and marked with streaks:<br>\
or, as some say, it is الشَّعَرِ ↓ مُحَبَّكُ, as in the K,<br>\
meaning the same; (TA;) or crisp-haired: (K:)<br>\
or حُبُكُ الشَّعِرَ, (IDrd, K, * TA,) meaning the<br>\
same: (TA:) or إِنَّ شَعَرَهُ حُبُكٌ حُبُكٌ: (S:) or<br>\
رَأْسُهُ حُبُكٌ حُبُكٌ. (TA.) In the phrase, in the<br>\
Kur [li. 7], وَ السَّمَآءِ ذَاتِ الحُبُكِ, it is said that<br>\
الحبك means the tracks of the stars, (S, Er-Rághib, TA,) and the milky way: or ideal<br>\
tracks: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or streaks of clouds:<br>\
(TA:) or beautiful طَرَائِق [which is generally<br>\
understood to mean, in this instance, streaks,<br>\
or the like; but may also be rendered stages, one<br>\
above another, to the number of seven]: (Zj,<br>\
TA:) or structures, or construction: (Mujáhid,<br>\
TA:) or beautiful construction. (I &#39;Ab, TA.)<br>\

horse; (K;) firm, or compact, in make: (TA:)<br>\
or strong in make; applied to a horse &amp;c. (S.)<br>\
And دَابَّةٌ مَحْبُوكَةٌ A beast having a well-knit<br>\
