حَلَيْتُ المَرْأَةَ, aor.<br>\
حَلِىَ, inf. n. حَلْىٌ, I assigned,<br>\
or gave, to the woman حُلِىّ [or ornaments];<br>\
and so حَلَوْتُهَا. (S.) [See also 2.]<br>\
-A2-  حَلِيَتْ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
حَلِىَ, (K,) inf. n. as above, (Msb, K,)<br>\
She (a woman) acquired an ornament, or orna<br>\
ments: (K:) or she wore on ornament, or orna<br>\
ments; as also ↓ تحلّت: (Msb, K:) or the<br>\
former signifies she had an ornament, or orna<br>\
ments: (S, K:) and ↓ the latter, she adorned<br>\
herself with an ornament, or ornaments: (S,<br>\
Mgh, * TA:) or she made for herself an orna<br>\
ment, or ornaments. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  لَمْ يَحْلَ<br>\
مِنْهُ بِطَائِلٍ He gained not, or derived not, from<br>\
him, or it, any great profit, advantage, or benefit:<br>\
the verb is not used in this sense except in nega<br>\
tive phrases; (S, TA;) and is from الحَلْىُ and<br>\
الحِلْيَةُ; because the mind reckons an ornament<br>\
as an acquisition: not from حلو. (TA.) [But<br>\
an affirmative phrase, with the verb حَلِىَ used in<br>\
a similar sense, is mentioned in the K in<br>\
art. حلو: see 1 in that art. See also 1 in art.<br>\
حلأ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  See also حَلِى, below.<br>\
-A3-  حَلِيَتِ الشَّفَةُ:<br>\
see حَلِئَت, in art. حلأ.<br>\
2<br>\
حلّى المَرْأَةَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَحْلِيَةٌ, (K,)<br>\
He decked the woman with an ornament, or<br>\
ornaments: (S, Msb, K: [see also 1, first sen<br>\
tence: and in like manner, السَّيْفَ the sword:])<br>\
or he made for her an ornament, or ornaments:<br>\
or he described her: (K:) or you say also حَلَّيْتُ<br>\
الرَّجُلَ as meaning I described the حِلْيَة [i. e.<br>\
quality, or qualities or attributes, or state or con<br>\
dition,] of the man: (S:) and you say also, حلّاهُ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ [he described it to him]. (L in art. سملج.)<br>\
The verb in the first of these senses is doubly<br>\
trans., as in the saying in the Kur [xviii. 30, &amp;c.],<br>\
يُحَلّوْنَ فِيهَا مِنْ أَسَاوِرَ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ [They shall be<br>\
decked therein with bracelets of gold]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
حَلَّيْتُمْ for حَلَّأْتُمْ: see 2 in art. حلأ.<br>\
5<br>\
تَحَلَّتْ: see 1, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
تحلّى فُلَانٌ بِمَا لَيْسَ فِيهِ Such a one affected that<br>\
which was not in him. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  تحلّاهُ He knew<br>\
his [حِلْيَة, i. e.] quality, or qualities or attributes,<br>\
or state or condition. (TA.)<br>\
حَلًا Pustules breaking out in the mouths of<br>\
children [app. after a fever; like حَلَأٌ]. (Kr, M.)<br>\
حَلْىٌ An ornament (Mgh, Msb, *, K) of a<br>\
woman, (S, Mgh, Msb,) of moulded metal, or of<br>\
stones, (K,) or of gold, or of silver, and some<br>\
say, or of jewels, or gems: (Mgh:) pl. حُلِىٌّ (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K) and حِلِىٌّ, also, because of the حُلِىٌّ<br>\
like عِصِىٌّ: (S, TA:) or حَلْىٌ is a pl. [or coll.<br>\
gen. n.], and its sing. [or n. un.] is ↓ حَلْيَةٌ: (K:)<br>\
so says AAF: (TA:) ↓ حِلْيَةٌ, also, signifies the<br>\
same as حَلْىٌ; (K; [in the CK حُلِىّ;]) and<br>\
particularly, (K,) the ornament, or ornaments,<br>\
حَلْىٌ, K, or زِينَةٌ, Mgh and Msb,) of gold or<br>\
silver, (Mgh,) of a sword, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) as<br>\
also ↓ حَلَاةٌ, (K,) or of a lamp, and of other<br>\
things: (Mgh:) accord. to Lth, حَلْىٌ signifies<br>\
any حِلْيَة [i. e. ornament, or ornaments,] with<br>\
which one decks a woman or a sword and the<br>\
like: but accord. to others, only of a woman;<br>\
and one says only ↓ حِلْيَةٌ in relation to other<br>\
things, to a sword [for instance], and the like:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. of حِلْيَةٌ is حِلًى and حُلًى; (S, K;)<br>\
or, accord. to IF, it has no pl. (Msb.)<br>\
حَلِى A cry by which a she-camel is chidden;<br>\
as also حَلِ and حَلْ; like as a he-camel is by the<br>\
cry حَوْبِ and حَوْبُ &amp;c.: (TA voce حَوْبِ:) or<br>\
by which female camels are chidden; as also<br>\
حَلْ, and, when in connexion with a following<br>\
word, حَلٍ. (TA voce حَلْ, in art. حل.) One<br>\
says, in chiding the she-camel, ↓ حَلِى لَا حَلِيتِ<br>\
[On! mayest thou not gain any great benefit:<br>\
like as one says, in chiding the he-camel, حَبْ<br>\
لَا مَشِيتَ, &amp;c.]. (TA in the present art.)<br>\
حَلَاةٌ: see حَلْىٌ.<br>\
حَلْيَةٌ: see حَلْىٌ.<br>\
حِلْيَةٌ: see حَلْىٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The<br>\
quality, or the aggregate of the attributes or<br>\
qualities, or the state or condition, (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K,) and the make, and form, (K,) and the<br>\
appearance in respect of colour, or complexion,<br>\
&amp;c., (Mgh,) of a man: (S, Mgh:) pl. حِلًى and<br>\
حُلًى. (Mgh, Msb, TA.) A description of the<br>\
face, or countenance, of a man. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  الحِلْيَةُ<br>\
in a trad. respecting الوُضُوْء means [The mode of<br>\
ablution termed] التَّحْجِيلُ. (TA. [See 2 in<br>\
art. حجل.])<br>\
حَلِىٌّ Dry, dried up, or tough. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
What has become dry (S, K) and white (K [but<br>\
see نَصِىٌّ]) of the [plant called] نَصِىّ, (S, K,)<br>\
and سَبَط: Az says, it is one of the best kinds of<br>\
pasture of the people of the desert for camels and<br>\
horses; and when its produce appears, it resembles<br>\
eared corn: accord. to Lth, it is every plant that<br>\
resembles corn, or seed-produce, in its manner of<br>\
growth; but this, says Az, is a mistake: (TA:)<br>\
n. un. with ة: (K:) and pl. أَحْلِيَةٌ. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  The<br>\
pole, or long piece of wood, [app. of a plough,]<br>\
that is between the two bulls: of the dial. of El<br>\
Yemen. (TA.)<br>\

an ornament or ornaments; (S, K;) as also ↓ حَلِيَّةٌ:<br>\
(S:) or wearing an ornament or ornaments; as<br>\
also ↓ مُتَحَلِّيَةٌ: (K:) pl. حَوَالٍ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[hence,] حَالِيَةٌ means (tropical:)  Trees having leaves and<br>\
fruit. (TA.)<br>\
مُحَلًّى Ornamented: applied to a sword [&amp;c.]<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
