حَلْقَمَهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. حَلْقَمَةٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
cut, or severed, his حُلْقُوم [or windpipe]; (S, K;)<br>\
accord. to the K, meaning his حَلْق; but see the<br>\
explanations of حلقوم below: (TA:) he slaughtered him in the manner termed ذَبْحٌ. (TA.)<br>\
[Mentioned in the Msb in art. حلق.]<br>\
-A2-  حَلْقَمَ<br>\
الرُّطَبُ [or rather البُسْرُ] (assumed tropical:)  The dates began to be<br>\
ripe next the base; as also حَلْقَنَ, in which the<br>\
ن is asserted by Yaakoob to be a substitute for م.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
Q. 3<br>\
احْلَنْقَمَ He left, or forsook, food; expl.<br>\
by تَرَكَ الطَّعَامَ. (K.)<br>\
حُلْقُومٌ The windpipe, or passage of the breath;<br>\
(T, Mgh, TA;) by the cutting, or severing, of<br>\
which, and of the مَرِىْء [or œsophagus] and<br>\
وَدَجَانِ [or two external jugular veins], the lawful<br>\
slaughtering of an animal is completed: (T, TA:)<br>\
accord. to the S and K, [and to the Msb, in art.<br>\
حلق, though it is there correctly and fully explained as meaning the windpipe,] i. q. حَلْقٌ: but<br>\
in the M it is explained [agreeably with general usage] as the passage of the breath, and<br>\
of coughing, from the جَوْف [or chest]; consisting<br>\
of a series of successively-superimposed cartilages<br>\
(أَطْبَاقُ غَرَاضِيفَ), before which, in the exterior of<br>\
the throat, is nothing but skin; having its lower<br>\
extremity in the lungs, and its upper extremity<br>\
at the root of the tongue: from it pass forth the<br>\
breath and the wind and the saliva and the voice:<br>\
[see also another explanation voce حَلْقٌ, from Zj<br>\
in his “ Khalk el-Insán,” and the Msb:] pl.<br>\
حَلَاقِمُ and حَلَاقِيمُ. (TA.) Accord. to some, the<br>\
م is augmentative: accord. to others, radical.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] they say, نَزَلْنَا مِثْلَ حُلْقُومِ<br>\
النَّعَامَةِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  We alighted in a strait, or<br>\
confined, place. (TA.) And حَلَاقِيمُ البِلَادِ means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The strait, or confined, parts of the country, or<br>\
of countries: (Mgh:) or the lateral, and extreme,<br>\
parts thereof. (TA.)<br>\
حُلْقَامةٌ: see what follows.<br>\
رُطَبٌ مُحَلْقِمٌ [or rather بُسْرٌ محلقم] (assumed tropical:)  Dates<br>\
that have begun to be ripe next the base; (K;)<br>\
[or that have become ripe to the extent of two<br>\
thirds; (see حُلْقَانٌ in art. حلق;)] as also مُحَلْقِنٌ:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ رُطَبَةٌ حُلْقَامَةٌ [or rather بُسْرَةٌ حلقامة<br>\
(in the CK حَلْقَامَةٌ)] is applied to a single date<br>\
in this sense. (K, * TA.)<br>\
