حَاصَ عَنْهُ, aor. يَحِيصُ, inf. n. حَيْصٌ and<br>\
حُيُوصٌ and مَحِيصٌ and مَحَاصٌ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
حَيَصَانٌ (S, K) and حَيْصُوصَةٌ (TA) and ↓ حَيْصَةٌ,<br>\
(K,) [or the last is an inf. n. of un.,] He turned<br>\
away from him, or it: (S, A, Msb, K:) and he<br>\
returned, or went back, and fled, from him, or it:<br>\
(TA:) and عنه ↓ انحاص signifies the same; (S,<br>\
K, TA;) and so does عنه ↓ تحايص: (TA:) or<br>\
(K) one says of friends, (S, K,) حَاصُوا, (K,) or<br>\
حاصوا عَنِ العَدُوِّ [they turned away from the<br>\
enemy]; (S;) [and in like manner, اِنْحَازُوا;] and<br>\
of enemies, اِنْهَزَمُوا; (S, K;) [and in like manner,<br>\
وَلَّوْا مُدْبِرِينَ.] You say also, حَاصَ عَنِ القِتَالِ He<br>\
turned away from the fight. (A.) And حَاصَ<br>\
عَنِ الحَقِّ He turned away from the truth; he<br>\
deviated from it. (Msb.) And حَاصَ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ<br>\
He turned away from the thing, and became safe<br>\
from it. (TA.) And it is said in a trad. respecting the battle of Ohod, فَحَاصَ المُسْلِمُونَ<br>\
↓ حَيْصَةٌ And the Muslims made a wheel away,<br>\
desiring flight: or, accord. to one relation, فَحَاضَ<br>\
حَيْضَةً, which means the same. (TA.) حَيْصٌ also<br>\
signifies The retiring, or going back, from a thing.<br>\
(S, TA.) [See also مَحِيصٌ, below.]<br>\
3<br>\
حايصهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُحَايَصَةٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
acted towards him with artifice, or guile; (K;)<br>\
vied with him; (TA;) and strove to overcome<br>\
him. (K.) Hence the saying of Mutarrif, related in a trad., when he was asked respecting his<br>\
going forth from the pestilence, هُوَ المَوْتُ نُحَايِصُهُ<br>\
وَلَا بُدَّ مِنْهُ, may be interpreted as meaning, [It is<br>\
death:] we are eager to flee from it [though there<br>\
is no avoiding it]. (AO, TA.)<br>\

وَقَعَ فِى حَاصِ بَاصِ: see what next follows.<br>\
وَقَعَ, (AA, S, A, and K in art. بيص,) and وَقَعُوا,<br>\
(S,) فِى حَيْصَ بَيْصَ, (S, A, and K ubi suprà,) and<br>\
حيص بِيصَ, (S in this art. and in art. بيص; and<br>\
so in the CK ubi suprà, and in a MS. copy of the<br>\
K, [though app. contradicted by what follows in<br>\
that work, as will be seen below,] or حِيصِ بِيصِ,<br>\
(K ubi suprà, accord. to some copies, and so in<br>\
the TA,) and حَيْص بَيْصِ, (K ubi suprà,) with<br>\
fet-h to the first [letter] of each and to the last of<br>\
each, (K ubi suprà,) and with kesr to the first of<br>\
each, (S in art. بيص,) or to both, and with fet-h<br>\
to the first of each and kesr to the last of each;<br>\
and sometimes each of the two [vars., namely,<br>\
حَيْص بَيْص and حِيص بِيص,] is made perfectly<br>\
decl. in the second [word], (K ubi suprà,) [so<br>\
that you say also حَيْصَ بَيْصٍ, and حِيصِ بِيصٍ,<br>\
and حَيْصِ بَيْصٍ; (though the copies of the K<br>\
differ in respect of these forms, two, for instance,<br>\
giving one form, which is written حَيْصٍ بَيْصٍ,<br>\
and one adding حِيصٍ بِيصٍ;) for it is said,] the<br>\
whole make six dial. vars.; and, accord. to MF,<br>\
each of the two [vars.] is sometimes made perfectly decl. in the first [word] also, [so that you<br>\
say حَيْصٍ بَيْصٍ, and حيصٍ بِيصٍ,] but this he<br>\
may have inferred from what will be afterwards<br>\
mentioned on the authority of ISk, (TA in art.<br>\
بيص,) and بَاصِ ↓ فِى حَاصِ, (K ubi suprà,)<br>\
indecl., with kesr for the termination, the ا being<br>\
[originally] ى; (TA ubi suprà;) He fell, (S,<br>\
K,) and they fell, (S,) into confusion in respect<br>\
of their case, or affair, from which there was no<br>\
escape for them: (S and K ubi suprà:) or into<br>\
straitness and difficulty: (S:) حَيْصَ بَيْصَ and<br>\
حِيصَ بِيصَ are each two nouns made into one,<br>\
and made indecl. with fet-h for their termination,<br>\
as in the instance of جَارِى بَيْتَ بَيْتَ: or, as<br>\
some assert, they are two nouns, from حَيْصٌ<br>\
meaning the “ turning away,” and “ retiring,”<br>\
or “ going back,” and بَوْصٌ meaning the “ outstripping,” and “ fleeing; ” and بوص is altered to<br>\
assimilate it to حيص; and the meaning is, an<br>\
affair, or a case, of any kind, from which one<br>\
retires, or goes back, and flees. (S.) You say<br>\
also, جَعَلْتُمُ الأَرْضَ عَلَيْهِ حَيْصَ بَيْصَ, (S and K,<br>\
both in art. بيص,) or حِيصَ بِيصَ, (S ubi suprà,)<br>\
and حَيْصًا بَيْصًا, (ISk, and K ubi suprà,) with<br>\
fet-h to each, and حِيصًا بِيصًا, with kesr to each,<br>\
not compounded, (ISk, and TA ubi suprà,) Ye<br>\
have straitened [the earth, or land,] to him, (S<br>\
and K ubi suprà,) so that he may not act as he<br>\
pleases therein: (K:) or so that he may not<br>\
travel therein in search of sustenance, nor employ<br>\
himself as he would to make gain. (Nh.) And<br>\
إِنَّكَ لَتَحْسِبُ عَلَىَّ الأَرْضَ حَيْصًا بَيْصًا, or, as some<br>\
say, حيصِ بيصِ, [i. e., حَيْصِ بَيْصِ or حِيصِ بِيصِ,<br>\
meaning, Verily thou thinkest the earth to be<br>\
straitened to me, so that I may not act as I please<br>\
therein: &amp;c.] (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  حَيْصَ بَيْصَ also signifies<br>\
The hole of the rat or mouse. (TA in art. بيص.)<br>\
حَيْصَةٌ: see 1, in two places.<br>\
حَيُوصٌ A beast (دَابَّةٌ) that takes fright, and<br>\
runs away at random; (K;) turning away from<br>\
that which its master desires: (TA:) a mule evil<br>\
in disposition. (TA.)<br>\
مَحِيصٌ [an inf. n.: (see 1:) and also a n. of<br>\
place, signifying A place to which one turns<br>\
away, or aside; to which one flees; a place of<br>\
refuge:] syn. مَحِيدٌ (S, K) and مَعْدِلٌ (Msb, K)<br>\
and مَمِيلٌ (K) and مَهْرَبٌ. (S, K.) You say,<br>\
مَا عَنْهُ مَحِيصٌ [There is no turning away, &amp;c., or<br>\
no place to which to turn away, &amp;c., from<br>\
it]. (S.)<br>\
