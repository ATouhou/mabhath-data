(K. [See 1.]) A poet says, (S,) namely, Zeyd<br>\

لَا تَعْبُدَنَّ إِلٰهًا غَيْرَ خَالِقِكُمْ<br>\
↓ وَإِنْ دُعِيتُمْ فَقُولُوا دُونَهُ حَدَدُ<br>\
[Ye shall by no means worship any deity except<br>\
your Creator; and if ye be invited to do so, say<br>\
ye, There is an impediment in the way of it, or<br>\
a prohibition against it]. (S, TA.) And one<br>\
says, ↓ دُونَ مَا سَأَلْتَ عَنْهُ حَدَدٌ (A, * L) There is<br>\
an impediment, or a prohibition, in the way of<br>\
that respecting which thou hast asked. (L.) And<br>\
عَنْهُ ↓ لَاحَدَدَ There is nothing to prevent, or<br>\
hinder, one from it. (L. [But this admits of<br>\
another meaning, as will be seen, under the word<br>\
حَدَدٌ, below.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] A restrictive ordinance, or statute, of God, respecting things lawful<br>\
and things unlawful: pl. حُدُودٌ. (L.) The حُدُود<br>\
of God are of two kinds: first, those ordinances<br>\
prescribed to men (T, Mgh, L) respecting eatables and drinkables and marriages &amp;c.; what<br>\
are lawful thereof and what are unlawful: (T,<br>\
L:) the second kind, castigations, or punishments,<br>\
prescribed, or appointed, to be inflicted upon<br>\
him who does that which he has been forbidden<br>\
to do; (T, Mgh, L;) as the حدّ of the thief,<br>\
which is the cutting off of his right hand for<br>\
stealing a thing of the value of a quarter of a<br>\
deenár or more; and that of the fornicator or<br>\
fornicatress, which is flogging with a hundred<br>\
stripes and banishment for a year; and that of<br>\
the adulterer or adulteress, which is stoning; and<br>\
that of the person who [falsely] charges an honest<br>\
or a married woman with adultery, which is<br>\
flogging with eighty stripes [as is also that of<br>\
the person who has committed the crime of<br>\
drunkenness]: (T, L:) the first kind are called<br>\
حدود because they denote limits which God has<br>\
forbidden to transgress: the second, because they<br>\
prevent one&#39;s committing again those acts for<br>\
which they are appointed as punishments; (T,<br>\
Mgh, L;) or because the limits thereof are determined: (Mgh:) the latter kind of حدّ is also<br>\
explained as being that [castigation, or punishment,] which prevents the criminal from returning to his crime, and prevents others from committing his crime. (L, K. *) لَوْ رَأَيْتَهُ عَلَى حَدٍّ,<br>\
in a saying of &#39; Omar, means Hadst thou seen<br>\
him engaged in an affair requiring the infliction<br>\
of the حدّ. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A bar, an obstruction,<br>\
a partition, or a separation, (S, A, Mgh, L,<br>\

persons,] to prevent their commixture, or confusion, or the encroachment of one upon the<br>\
other: (L:) an inf. n. used as a subst.: (Mgh:)<br>\
pl. حُدُودٌ. (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  A limit, or boundary, of a<br>\
land or territory: pl. as above. (L.) [Hence,<br>\
جَاوَزَ الحَدَّ (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, exceeded the proper, due,<br>\
or common, limit; was excessive, immoderate,<br>\
beyond measure, enormous, inordinate, or exorbitant.] ―<br>\
-b5-  [And hence, in logic, (assumed tropical:)  A definition.]<br>\
It is applied by the learned to the حَقِيقَة of a<br>\
thing, [or that by being which a thing is what it<br>\
is,] because it is [a term] collective and restrictive. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b6-  The end, extremity, or utmost<br>\
point, of a thing: (S, L, K:) pl. as above. (L.)<br>\
―<br>\

of arms or weapons: or this may mean (tropical:)  persons<br>\

like: see 1]. ―<br>\
