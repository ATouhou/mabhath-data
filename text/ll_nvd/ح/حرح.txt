حَرَحَهَا, aor.<br>\
حَرَحَ, He hit, or hurt, her (a woman&#39;s) حِرْح or حِر [i. e. vulva, or pudendum]. (K.)<br>\
حِرٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) similar in form to يَدٌ and<br>\
دَمٌ, (Msb,) and حِرٌّ (AHeyth, Az, Msb) and حِرَةٌ;<br>\
(K;) the first of which is the most common; and<br>\
the last, strange; (TA;) or the first is sometimes<br>\
used instead of the second; (Msb;) The vulva,<br>\
or pudendum, of a woman: originally ↓ حِرْحٌ, (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) as is shown by the form of its<br>\
broken pl., (S, Mgh, Msb,) and by that of its<br>\
dim.; for in the formation of the broken pl. and<br>\
of the dim., a word is restored to its original state:<br>\
the final ح in the original is elided, and ر is put<br>\
in its stead, and incorporated into the medial<br>\
radical letter; and sometimes the word is used<br>\
without any letter of compensation: thus are<br>\
formed حِرٌّ and حِرٌ: (Msb:) the pl. is أَحْرَاحٌ,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) its only broken pl., (TA,)<br>\
and حِرُونَ, (S, K,) which latter is like لِدُونَ and<br>\
مِئُونَ, pls. of defective nouns [لِدَةٌ and مِئَةٌ]: (S:)<br>\
dim. ↓ حُرَيْحٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
حِرْحٌ: see the paragraph next preceding.<br>\
حَرِحٌ A man loving, (L, TA,) or fond of, (K,)<br>\
the أَحْرَاح [or pudenda] of women: (L, K:) an<br>\
epithet after the manner of a rel. n. (Sb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also حِرِىٌّ.<br>\
حِرَحِىٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\
حِرِىٌّ, and (if you will, S) ↓ حِرَحِىٌّ, (S, K,) in<br>\
which latter the medial radical letter is with fet-h,<br>\
as in the rel. ns. formed from يَدُ and غَدٌ, namely,<br>\
يَدَوِىٌّ and غَدَوِىٌّ; (S;) [Of, or belonging to, or<br>\
relating to, the vulva, or pudendum, of a woman;]<br>\
rel. ns. of حِرٌ [and حِرْحٌ]: and (if you will, S)<br>\
you may say ↓ حَرِحٌ, like سَتِةٌ. (S, K.)<br>\
حُرَيحٌ: see حِرٌ, above.<br>\
مَحْرُوحَةٌ A woman hit, or hurt, in her حِرْح or<br>\
حِر [i. e. vulva, or pudendum]. (K.)<br>\
