and مَحِيدٌ (K) and حَيْدُودَةٌ, (S, K,) which last<br>\
is originally حَيَدُودَةٌ, with the ى movent; this<br>\
letter being afterwards made quiescent; for there is<br>\
not in the language any word of the measure<br>\
فَعْلُولٌ, except صَعْفُوقٌ; (S; [see the remarks<br>\

namely, a road, (S,) or a thing: (Msb:) he<br>\

disdain. (Az, L.) [See also 3.] You say, مَا<br>\
لَكَ مَحِيدٌ عَنْ ذٰلِكَ There is not, for thee, any avoiding that. (L.) And حَادَتِ الدَّابَّةُ The beast became<br>\

part of a strap, or thong, projecting beyond the<br>\
rest: (L:) any rib, (L, K,) or other bone, (L,)<br>\

(T:) a projecting portion, or ledge, of a mountain, resembling a wing: (S, M, L, K:) pl. (of<br>\
the former word, S) أَحْيَادٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and<br>\
(of both words, S) حُيُودٌ and (of the latter, S)<br>\
حِيَدٌ: (S, K:) the حُيُود of a camel are such<br>\

You say جَبَلٌ ذُو حُيُودٍ and أَحْيَادٍ, meaning A<br>\
mountain having projecting edges in its lower<br>\
parts, not in its upper parts. (S.) And قَعَدْتُ<br>\
تَحْتَ حَيْدِ الجَبَلِ I sat beneath the part of the<br>\
mountain that projected like a wing. (A.)<br>\

حَيَدَى The manner of walking of a proud and<br>\
self-conceited person. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  حِمَارٌ حَيَدَى (S, K)<br>\
and ↓ حَيِّدٌ, (K,) each occurring in a verse of<br>\
[Umeiyeh the son of] Aboo-&#39;Áïdh El-Hudhalee<br>\
accord. to different relations thereof, (L, [see<br>\
جَمَّازٌ,]) An ass that turns aside from, or shies at,<br>\
his shadow, by reason of his briskness, liveliness, or<br>\
sprightliness: (S, K:) or that is wont often to turn<br>\
aside from things, or to shy at them. (S.) حَيَدَى is<br>\
also applied as an epithet to a she-ass. (IAar.)<br>\
It is [said to be] the only masc. epithet of the<br>\
measure فَعَلَى, (S, K,) except دَلَظَى a man “ who<br>\
thrusts vehemently,” (IJ,) and وَقَرَى [but this<br>\
is written in the K وَقَرِىٌّ] “ a pastor of a وَقِير,<br>\
or flock of sheep,” and قَفَطَى vir “ multum<br>\
coiens,” and جَمَزَى a “ quick ” ass. (MF.) But<br>\
probably حَيِّدٌ is the only correct word of the<br>\
two above mentioned. (L.) [Or حِمَارٌ حَيَدَى is<br>\
for حِمَارٌ ذُو حَيَدَى: see جَمَزَى, voce جَمَّازٌ.]<br>\

the legs of a beast as he goes along. (S, K.)<br>\
حَيِّدٌ: see حَيَدَى.<br>\
حَيَادِ, like قَطَامِ, (L,) indecl., with kesr for its<br>\
termination, [and of the fem. gender,] occurs<br>\
in the phrase (TA) حِيدِى حَيَادِ, similar to<br>\
فِيحِى فَيَاحِ, (S, L, K,) meaning Turn thou aside,<br>\
or away, [from me:] (A, L:) said by one when<br>\
the time for fighting is come, (L,) and by one<br>\
fleeing. (Ibn-Abi-l-Hadeed.)<br>\
حَيُودٌ [That declines, or goes away, much, or<br>\
frequently]: an intensive epithet, applied by<br>\
&#39;Alee to worldly prosperity (الدُّنْيَا). (L.)<br>\
مَحِيدٌ an inf. n. of حَادَ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [It may also<br>\
be used, agreeably with analogy, as a noun of<br>\
place, signifying A place to which one turns<br>\
aside or away; to which one removes, goes away,<br>\
or goes far away.]<br>\
