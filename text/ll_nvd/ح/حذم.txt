حَذَمَهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
حَذِمَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
حَذْمٌ, (S, Msb,) He cut it, or cut it off, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) in any manner: (TA:) or hastily, or quickly.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [He did it quickly: or] he was<br>\
quick in it; [as also حَذَمَ فِيهِ;] i. e., in any<br>\
action. (S, Msb.) You say, حَذَمَ فِى مَشْيِهِ,<br>\
(Msb,) and قِرَآءَتِهِ, فى (S, K,) He was quick [in his<br>\
walking, or going, and in his reading, or reciting]:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) and so in other things: (K:) by<br>\
“ other things ” being here meant walking and<br>\
the like; for حَذْمٌ, of which the verb is حَذَمَ,<br>\
signifies the being quick in walking, app. with a<br>\
stretching out of the arms backwards: (TA:)<br>\
and a light, an active, or an agile, walking. (S,<br>\
TA.) [See also حَذَمَانٌ, below.] Hence, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA,) &#39;Omar said, (S, TA,) to the مُؤَذّن of<br>\
Jerusalem, (TA,) إِذَا أَذَّنْتَ قَتَرَسَّلْ وَإِذَا أَقَمْتَ<br>\
فَاحْذِمْ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, TA,) i. e. [When thou<br>\
chantest the أَذَان, be moderate; not quick: and<br>\
when thou chantest the إِقَامَة,] cut short the<br>\
lengthening of thine utterance; meaning, be quick<br>\
in the اقامة: (As, Mgh, TA:) another reading<br>\
is said to have been given by Z, namely, [فَاخْذِمْ,]<br>\
with خ. (TA.)<br>\
حَذَمٌ The flight of a bird that has its wings<br>\
clipt, (K, TA,) as the pigeon and the like. (TA.)<br>\
حَذِمٌ A sharp, or cutting, sword; as also ↓ حِذْيَمٌ,<br>\
with kesr to the ح, (K,) and with fet-h to the<br>\
ى; (TA;) or ↓ حَذِيمٌ. (So in two copies of<br>\
the S.)<br>\
حُذَمٌ and ↓ حُذَمَةٌ Short in stature and in step;<br>\
(K;) applied to a man: (TA:) and the latter is<br>\
likewise fem.; (S, K, TA;) applied to a woman<br>\
as meaning short in stature. (S, TA.)<br>\
حُذُمٌ Swift hares. (IAar, K. [See also حُذَمَةٌ.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And Skilful thieves. (IAar, K.)<br>\
حُذَمَةٌ; see حُذَمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says of the female<br>\
hare, حُذَمَةٌ لُذَمَةٌ تَسْبِقُ الجَمْعَ بِالأَكَمَةِ, i. e.<br>\
Swift, persistent in running, she outstrips the<br>\
company pursuing her upon the hill. (TA.)<br>\
حَذَمَانٌ Quickness in walking or going: (K:)<br>\
accord. to Aboo-&#39;Adnán, a pace of the kind<br>\
termed ذَمِيلٌ, exceeding what is termed مَشْىٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Slowness (K, TA) in walking or<br>\
going: so says Aboo-&#39;Adnán on the authority of<br>\
Khálid Ibn-Jembeh. (TA.) Thus it bears two<br>\
contrary meanings. (K.)<br>\
حُذَامٌ an epithet applied to a slave: so in the<br>\
saying, اِشْتَرَى عَبْدًا حُذَامَ المَشْىِ He bought a<br>\
slave slow [in gait], lazy, (K, TA,) devoid of<br>\
good: so says Khálid Ibn-Jembeh. (TA.)<br>\
حَذِيمٌ: see حَذِمٌ.<br>\
حِذْيَمٌ Skilful (K, TA) in a thing. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also حَذِمٌ.<br>\
