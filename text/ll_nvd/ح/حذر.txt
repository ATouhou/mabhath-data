you caution a person [against another], ↓ حَذَرَكَ<br>\
زَيْدًا [Beware thou of Zeyd]; (K, * TA;) and<br>\
حَذَارَيْكَ زَيْدًا, (K,) which latter means Beware<br>\
thou, and beware thou again, of Zeyd: both then<br>\
[also] being verbal nouns. (TA.)<br>\
حَذِيرٌ [A cautioner]. You say, أَنَا حَذِيرُكَ مِنْهُ<br>\

or unexpectedly; or it may here mean a punishment, or chastisement; or a crying-out, which is<br>\
the primary signification]: (A:) and war. (K.)<br>\
