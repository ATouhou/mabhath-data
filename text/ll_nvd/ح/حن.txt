حَنَّ, aor.<br>\
حَنِ3َ, inf. n. حَنِينٌ, He was, or became,<br>\
affected with [a yearning, longing, or desire, or]<br>\
an intense emotion of grief or of joy; as also<br>\
↓ استحنّ and ↓ تحانّ. (K.) [See an instance of<br>\
its denoting an emotion of joy voce حَنَّانٌ.] You<br>\
say, حَنَّ إِلَيْهِ, aor. and inf. n. as above, He, or<br>\
his soul, yearned towards, longed for, or desired,<br>\
him, or it. (S.) And حَنَّ إِلَى وَطَنِهِ He yearned<br>\
towards, longed for, or desired, his home. (TA.)<br>\
And تَحِنَّ إِلَى زَوْجِهَا الأَوَّلِ [She yearns towards<br>\
her first, or former, husband]. (TA.) And حَنَّتْ,<br>\
inf. n. as above, She (a woman) yearned towards,<br>\
longed for, or desired, her child, or children.<br>\
(Msb.) So, too, one says of a she-camel, meaning She yearned towards, longed for, or desired,<br>\
her home, or her young one; and in like manner,<br>\
of a pigeon: but in most instances it means she<br>\
(a camel) yearned with a cry, or uttered a cry<br>\
when yearning [or a yearning cry or the cry produced by yearning], towards her young one or her<br>\
companions: or she uttered a cry with emotion<br>\
after her young one: in its primary sense, she<br>\
reiterated her [yearning] cry after her young<br>\
one: but when you say, حَنَّ قَلْبِى إِلَيْهِ, you mean<br>\
My heart yearned towards, longed for, or desired,<br>\
him, or it, without the uttering of a cry or sound.<br>\
(TA.) They said also, لَاأَفْعَلُهُ حَتَّى يَحِنَّ الضَّبُّ<br>\
فِى أَثَرِ الإِبِلِ الصَّادِرَةِ [I will not do it until the<br>\
lizard called ضبّ yearn after the camels returning from the water; meaning I will never do<br>\
it]: this is only a prov.; for the ضبّ has no حَنِين<br>\
nor does it ever go to the water. (TA.) [And<br>\
حنَّ العُودُ, aor. and inf. n. as above, (assumed tropical:)  The lute<br>\
produced plaintive sounds: or excited lively<br>\
emotions of sadness, or of mirth: see حَنَّانٌ. And<br>\
in like manner one says of a musical reed: see<br>\
مُثَقَّب.] And حَنَّتِ القَوْسُ, (K,) aor. as above,<br>\
(S,) and so the inf. n., (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  The bow [twanged,<br>\
or] made a sound (K, TA) when its string had<br>\
been pulled and then let go. (S.) And حَنَّتِ<br>\
الطَّسْتُ إِذَا نُقِرَتْ (tropical:)  [The brazen basin rang when<br>\
it was knocked, or pecked]. (TA.) And حَنَّتِ<br>\
السَّارِيَةُ [The mast creaked, or made a creaking<br>\
sound]. (TA in art. صر.) And حَنَّ قِدْحُ لَيْسَ مِنْهَا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [An arrow of those used in the game called<br>\
المَيْسِر produced a sound: it was not of them]:<br>\
a prov., applied to a man who ascribes to himself<br>\
a false origin, or who arrogates to himself that to<br>\
which he has no relation: by the قدح is meant<br>\
one of the arrows of the ميسر; for when this<br>\
is not of the same substance as the others, and<br>\
is made to vibrate, it produces a sound different<br>\
from the sounds of the others, and is known<br>\
thereby. (TA. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov.<br>\
i. 341.]) And حَنَّتِ الرِّيحُ and ↓ استحنّت (assumed tropical:)  [The<br>\
wind made a plaintive, or moaning, or perhaps<br>\
a shrill, sound; made a sound like the حَنِين of<br>\
camels: see حَنُونٌ]: both signify the same. (TA.)<br>\
[See also حَنِينٌ, below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  حَنَّ عَلَيْهِ, (S, Msb,<br>\
TA,) aor. as above, (S, Msb,) inf. n. حَنَانٌ (S,<br>\
Msb, K *) and حَنَّةٌ (Msb, TA *) and حَنٌّ, (K, *<br>\
TA,) He was merciful, compassionate, or pitiful,<br>\
towards him, or it; (S, Msb, K, * TA:) as also<br>\
↓ تحنّن: (S, K:) he was, or became, favourably<br>\
inclined towards him, or it; (Msb;) and so<br>\
↓ تحنّن: (TA:) he was, or became, affectionate,<br>\
or pitiful, or compassionate, towards him; (K, *<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ حَنْحَنَ. (IAar, Az, K.) And<br>\
عَلَى وَلَدِهَا ↓ تَحَنَّنَتْ She (a camel, and a ewe or<br>\
goat,) became favourably inclined, or compassionate, towards her young one. (Lh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
See also 2. ―<br>\
-b4-  حَنَّ عَنِّى, aor.<br>\
حَنُ3َ, means صَدَّ; (S;)<br>\
i. e. He turned away from me, avoided me, or<br>\
shunned me: so that it is anomalous; for by rule<br>\
the aor. should be<br>\
حَنِ3َ; and it is not mentioned<br>\
among the exceptions [to the rule applying to<br>\
a case of this kind]. (MF, TA.) [But it appears<br>\
from what here follows that صَدَّ may perhaps<br>\
be here meant to be understood in its trans.<br>\
sense.]<br>\
-A2-  حَنَّهُ, (K,) [aor.<br>\
حَنُ3َ, as is shown below,]<br>\
inf. n. حَنٌّ, (TA,) signifies صَدَّهُ and صَرَفَهُ [He<br>\
turned him, or it, away, or back]. (K, TA.) You<br>\
say, حُنَّ عَنِّى شَرَّكَ, inf. n. حَنٌّ, Turn thou away,<br>\
or back, from me thy evil, or mischief. (K.) And<br>\
مَا تَحُنُّنِى شَيْئًا مِنْ شَرِّكَ Thou dost not turn away,<br>\
or back, from me aught of thy evil, or mischief<br>\
(S.)<br>\
-A3-  [حُنَّ, inf. n. حَنٌّ, app. He was, or became,<br>\
possessed by a demon, or by one of the tribe or<br>\
kind or class termed الحِنّ; and hence, he was,<br>\
or became, mad, or insane: for] حَنٌّ is syn. with<br>\
جُنُونٌ; (TA as from the K; [but not in the CK<br>\
nor in my MS. copy of the K;]) whence مَحْنُونٌ<br>\
applied to a man [as meaning مَجْنُونٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
حَنَّ3َ [حنّنهُ عَلَى غَيْرِهِ, accord. to modern usage,<br>\
and perhaps classical also, He, or it, caused him<br>\
to be merciful, compassionate, pitiful, or favourably inclined, towards another.]<br>\
-A2-  حَمَلَ فَحَنَّنَ<br>\
He charged, or made an assault or attack, and<br>\
was cowardly, and retreated. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَا<br>\
حَنَّنَ عَنِّى He did not turn away from me; did<br>\
not leave, or relinquish, me. (TA.) [And ↓ احنّ,<br>\
or ↓ حَنَّ, seems to have a similar meaning: for]<br>\
you say, أَثَرٌ لَا يُحِنُّ عَنِ الجِلْدِ A mark that does<br>\
not go away from the skin: or, accord. to Th,<br>\
who does not explain it, it is يَحِنُّ. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
حَنَّنَتِ الشَّجَرَةُ The tree blossomed, or flowered:<br>\
(K:) and in like manner one says of a herb.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

احنّ القَوْسَ He made the bow to [twang,<br>\
or] give a sound, [by pulling, and then letting<br>\
go, the string.] (K.)<br>\
-A2-  And احنّ He (a man.<br>\
TA) did wrong, committed a mistake, or missed<br>\
[the object of his aim]. (K.) ―<br>\

(IAar, K:) or the dogs thereof: (Fr, TA:) or<br>\
certain creatures between the جِنّ and mankind.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
حَنَّةٌ: see حَنَانٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in a prov., لَا<br>\
تَعْدَمُ نَاقَةٌ مِنْ أُمِّهَا حَنَّةً, and ↓ حَنِينًا, meaning<br>\
[The she-camel will not be without] likeness [to<br>\
her mother]: and one says of a man who resembles<br>\
another man, and of any one who resembles his<br>\
father and his mother, لَا تَعْدَمُ أَدْمَآءُ مِنْ أُمِّهَا حَنَّةً<br>\
[A female camel of the colour termed أُدْمَة (i. e.<br>\
white, or very white, &amp;c.,) will not be without<br>\
likeness to her mother]. (TA. [See also Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Arab. Prov. ii. 497.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  The [grumbling cry<br>\
termed] رُغَآء of a camel. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  A man&#39;s<br>\
wife. (S, K.)<br>\

حِنَّةٌ: see حَنَانٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. جِنَّةٌ; (S, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ حَنَّةٌ: (K:) so in the phrase, بِهِ حِنَّةٌ [In<br>\
him is demoniacal possession, or madness, or insanity: see الحِنُّ]. (S.)<br>\
حَنَانٌ Mercy, compassion, or pity: (S, K:)<br>\
tenderness of heart; (K;) which is the same;<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ حِنَّةٌ, with kesr; (Kr, TA;) for<br>\
which the vulgar say ↓ حَنِّيِّةٌ: (TA:) and ↓ حَنَّةٌ<br>\
[in like manner] signifies affection, and compassion. (Az, TA.) وَحَنَانًا مِنْ لَدُنَّا, in the Kur<br>\
[xix. 14], respecting which I &#39;Ab is related by<br>\
&#39;Ikrimeh to have said, I know not what is الحَنَانُ,<br>\
means And mercy from us. (S, TA.) The Arabs<br>\
say, حَنَانَكَ يَا رَبِّ and حَنَانَيْكَ [I beg thy mercy,<br>\
O my Lord]: both signify the same; i. e. رَحْمَتَكَ:<br>\
(S:) the latter is the expression commonly used:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, in a marginal note in a copy of the<br>\
S:) or [rather] the latter means have mercy on<br>\
me time after time, and with mercy after mercy:<br>\
(K, * TA:) it is a dualized inf. n., of which the<br>\
verb is not expressed; like لَبَّيْكَ and سَعْدَيْكَ: (TA:)<br>\
or it means [let thy mercy be continuous to me;]<br>\
whenever I receive mercy and good from Thee,<br>\
let it not cease, but be conjoined with other mercy<br>\
from Thee: (ISd, TA:) the dual form is not<br>\
to be understood as restricting the signification to<br>\
duality: (Suh, TA:) the word is not used in this<br>\
form otherwise than as a prefixed noun: (Sb,<br>\
TA:) but sometimes they said حَنًانًا, in the sing.,<br>\
without prefixing it. (ISd, TA.) They said also,<br>\
سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ وَحَنَانَيْهِ meaning [I extol, or celebrate,<br>\
or declare, the absolute purity, or perfection, or<br>\
glory, of God,] and I beg his mercy; like as they<br>\
said, سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ وَرَيْحَانَهُ. (TA.) And حَنَانَ اللّٰهِ<br>\
as meaning مَعَاذَ اللّٰهِ [I seek the protection, or<br>\
preservation, of God]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also i. q. رِزْقٌ<br>\
[Means of subsistence, &amp;c.]: and بَرَكَةٌ [a blessing; any good that is bestowed by God; prosperity, or good fortune; increase; &amp;c.]. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  A quality inspiring reverence or veneration<br>\
or respect or honour: (El-Umawee, K:) gravity,<br>\
staidness, or sedateness. (K.) One says, مَاتَرَى<br>\
لَهُ حَنَانًا Thou seest him not to possess any quality<br>\
inspiring reverence &amp;c. (El-Umawee, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Evil, or mischief, long continuing. (K.)<br>\
حَنُونٌ A wind (رِيح) [that makes a plaintive,<br>\
or moaning, or perhaps a shrill, sound;] that<br>\
makes a sound like the حَنِين of camels. (S, K,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A woman who marries from a motive of<br>\
tenderness, or compassion, for her children, (K,<br>\
TA,) when they are young, (TA,) in order that<br>\
the husband may maintain them. (K, TA.)<br>\
حَنِينٌ an inf. n. of 1: (S, Msb, K:) A yearning,<br>\
longing, or desire; (S, K;) a yearning, or longing, of the soul: (S:) or the expression of pain<br>\
arising from yearning or longing or desire: (Ham<br>\
p. 538:) violence of weeping: and a lively emotion:<br>\
or the sound produced by such emotion, proceeding<br>\
from grief, or from joy: (K:) or a sound proceeding from the bosom on the occasion of weeping:<br>\
خَنِينٌ is from the nose: (TA:) or the former is<br>\
[a sound] without weeping and without tears:<br>\
if with weeping, it is termed خَنِينٌ: (R, TA:)<br>\
or the former is a yearning, or longing, or desire,<br>\
with affection, or pity, or compassion; as when<br>\
one speaks of the حنين of a woman and of a she-camel for her young one: and sometimes this is<br>\
accompanied with a sound, or cry; wherefore it<br>\
is explained as a sound, or cry, indicating yearning or longing or desire, and affection or pity or<br>\
compassion: and sometimes it is confined to the<br>\
form; as in the case of the حنين [or leaning, or<br>\
inclining,] of the trunk of a palm-tree [which<br>\
is mentioned in a trad.]: (Er-Rághib:) the حنين<br>\
of the she-camel is ber cry in her yearning<br>\
towards her young one: (S:) or her yearning<br>\
towards her young one with a cry, and without<br>\
a cry; (Lth, TA;) mostly the former: originally,<br>\
her reiterating her [yearning] cry after her young<br>\
one. (TA.) You say also, رِيحٌ لَهَا حَنِينٌ كَحَنِينِ<br>\
الإِبِلِ (assumed tropical:)  [A wind that has a plaintive, or moaning,<br>\
or perhaps a shrill, sound, like the حنين of camels].<br>\

and ↓ حِنِّينٌ and الحِنِّينُ, two names of [The<br>\
months called] جُمَادَى الأُولَى and الآخِرَةُ: (K:)<br>\
or حَنِينٌ is a name of جمادى الاولى, like a proper<br>\
name; as also الحَنِينُ: (M, TA:) or the name<br>\
by which the tribe of &#39;Ád called جمادى الآخرة:<br>\
(Ibn-El-Kelbee, in TA voce مُؤْتَمِرٌ: see شَهْرٌ:) or,<br>\
accord. to Fr and El-Mufaddal, the Arabs used<br>\
to call this month ↓ حُنَيْنٌ: (T, TA:) pl. [of<br>\
pauc.] أَحِنَّةٌ and [of mult.] حُنُونٌ and حَنَائِنُ. (K.)<br>\

grieving, or moaning, (K, TA,) in tenderness for<br>\

yearns towards her former husband, and inclines<br>\
to him: or who yearns towards her child, or<br>\
children, by her husband who has separated from<br>\
her: (TA:) or a woman who yearns towards<br>\
her former husband, and grieves for him: or<br>\
who marries, having been divorced, and yearns<br>\
towards him who has divorced her. (Har p. 569.)<br>\
And (assumed tropical:)  A bow; (K;) [because of the sound<br>\
made by the twanging of its string;] accord. to<br>\
AHn, as a proper name; but ISd holds it to be,<br>\
when thus applied, an epithet in which the quality<br>\
of a subst. is predominant: (TA:) or a bow that<br>\
[twangs, or] makes a sound (S, K) when its string<br>\
has been pulled and then let go. (S.) And عُودٌ<br>\

mirth. (TA.) And سَحَابٌ حَنَّانٌ (assumed tropical:)  Clouds that<br>\
