حَفْرٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) He dug, excavated, or hollowed out, the ground, or earth; (KL, PS, &amp;c.;)<br>\

عَلَيْهِ, and حَفَرَهُ, and ↓ احتفرهُ, He dug for him,<br>\
(namely, a lizard of the kind called ضَبّ, or a<br>\
jerboa,) to fetch him forth. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [He<br>\
burrowed.] ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  It (a torrent) furrowed a valley.<br>\
(Msb.) [See also 5.] ―<br>\
-b4-  (tropical:)  Inivit feminam: (IAar,<br>\
Msb, K:) the action being likened to that of<br>\
a man digging a river. (IAar.) ―<br>\
-b5- .) ―<br>\
-b6-  هٰذَا غَيْثٌ لَا<br>\
يَحْفِرُهُ أَحَدٌ (tropical:)  This is a rain of which no one knows<br>\
the utmost extent. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  حَفَرَ ثَرَي زَيْدٍ<br>\
(tropical:)  He searched into the affair, or case, of Zeyd,<br>\
(A, K,) and became acquainted with it. (K.) ―<br>\

And حَفَرَ, (S, A, K,) aor. as above, (S,) and so<br>\
the inf. n., (S, A,) (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, emaciated, or rendered lean: (S, K:) it (a copious flow of milk,<br>\
TA) emaciated a she-goat: (K, TA:) (tropical:)  he (a<br>\
young camel) rendered his mother flabby in flesh<br>\
by much sucking. (A.) There is no pregnant<br>\
animal that pregnancy does not emaciate, except<br>\
the camel: (S, A:) she fattens in pregnancy.<br>\
(S.)<br>\
-A2-  حَفَرَ He (a child) shed his رَوَاضِع [or<br>\
milk-teeth]. (K, TA.) [See also 4.] ―<br>\
-b2-  حَفَرَتْ<br>\
رَوَاضِعُ المُهْرِ, or حُفِرَتْ, (accord. to different copies<br>\
of the A,) (tropical:)  The milk-teeth of the colt became in<br>\
a wabbling, or loose, state, previously to their<br>\

―<br>\
-b3-  حَفَرَتِ الأَسْنَانُ, aor.<br>\
حَفِرَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. حَفْرٌ; (S, Msb;) and حَفِرَت, aor.<br>\
حَفَرَ, (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. حَفَرٌ, in the dial. of BenooAsad, (S, Msb,) and this is the worse of these two<br>\
forms, (S,) and حَفْرٌ; (El-Wá&#39;ee;) and حُفِرَت;<br>\
(K;) (tropical:)  The teeth became affected with what is<br>\
termed حَفْرٌ [q. v. infrà] or حَفَرٌ: (S, Msb, K:)<br>\
or became unsound: (Mgh:) and حَفَرَ فُوهُ and<br>\
حَفِرَ his teeth cankered. (A.) IDrst says, in the<br>\
Expos. of the Fs, that حَفَرَ, aor.<br>\
حَفِرَ, inf. n. حَفْرَ فُوهُ,<br>\
is trans.; and that the cause of حَفْر of the teeth,<br>\
[or the agent of the verb حَفَرَ,] is old age, or the<br>\
continuance of a yellow incrustation, [or tartar,]<br>\
or some kind of canker that effects them: but<br>\
that the verb in the phrase حَفِرَتْ سِنُّهُ, aor.<br>\
حَفَرَ,<br>\
inf. n. حَفَرٌ, is intrans. (MF.) [The truth probably is, that the former verb is both trans. and intrans., and hence حُفِرَتِ الأَسْنَانُ; and that the<br>\
latter is intrans. only.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And حَفِرَ, aor.<br>\
حَفَرَ, (assumed tropical:)  It<br>\

state. (Az.)<br>\

jerboa) went deep into his hole; (A;) so deep<br>\
that he could not be dug out. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
احفر فُلَانًا بِئْرًا He assisted such a one to dig<br>\
a well. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  احفر الصَّبِىُّ, (K,) inf. n. إِحْفَارٌ,<br>\
(TA,) (tropical:)  The child shed his two upper and lower<br>\
central incisors: (سَقَطَتْ لَهُ الثَّنِيَّتَانِ العُلْيَيَانِ<br>\
وَالسُّفْلَيَانِ:) so in the K: and to these words we<br>\
find added, in some copies of the K, لِلْإِثْنَآءَ وَالإِرْبَاعِ;<br>\
and then, وَالمُهْرُسَقَطَتْ ثَنَايَاهُ وَرَبَاعِيَاتُهُ: but in<br>\
some good and corrected copies, we read, after<br>\
السفليان, thus, والمهر للاثناء والا رباع سقطت ثناياه<br>\
ورباعياته: to which, in some lexicons, [as in the<br>\
S, though the explanation which follows is there<br>\
different,] after والارباع, is added وَالقُرُوحِ. (TA.<br>\
[This is evidently the right reading; and therefore<br>\
I follow it in an explanation in what is here immediately subjoined.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  احفر المُهْرُ لِلْإِثْنَآءِ وَالْإِرْبَاعِ<br>\
(tropical:)  The colt shed his central incisors, or nippers,<br>\
and each of the teeth immediately next to these:<br>\
(K: see what next precedes:) or احفر المُهْرُ لِلْإِثْنَآءَ<br>\
وَالْإِرْبَاعِ وَالْقُرُوحِ the colt shed his milk teeth (رَوَاضِع),<br>\
[the central pair, the second pair, and the third<br>\
pair, in each jaw,] and grew others: (S:) or<br>\
احفر المهر, [inf. n. إِحْفَارٌ,] signifies, the colt had<br>\
his milk-teeth in a wabbling, or loose, state, previously to their falling out; because, when they<br>\
have fallen out, their sockets become hollow:<br>\
(A:) or the colt had his lower and upper central<br>\
pairs of nippers, of his milk-teeth, in a wabbling,<br>\
or loose, state: this is during a period extending<br>\
from thirty months, at the earliest, to three years:<br>\
then the teeth fall out: then a lower and an<br>\
upper central pair of nippers grow in the place<br>\
of the milk-nippers which have fallen out, after<br>\
three years; and the epithet مُبْدِيءٌ is applied<br>\
to the colt; and the epithet ثَنِىٌّ is [also] then<br>\
applied to him, and continues to be until [again<br>\
it is said of him] يُحْفِرُ, meaning, he has his<br>\
lower and upper pairs of nippers, of his milkteeth, in a wabbling, or loose, state: then these<br>\
fall out, when he has completed four years: then<br>\
the term إِبْدَآءٌ is [again] applied to him; [i. c.,<br>\
he is again termed مُبْدِيءٌ;] and he is, and ceases<br>\
not to be, termed رَبَاعٍ, until [it is said of him]<br>\
يُحْفِرُ لِلْقٌرُوحِ [in the TA, تُحْفِر القُرُوح, which is<br>\
an evident mistake,] meaning, he has his two<br>\
corner nippers [in each jaw] in a wabbling, or<br>\
loose, state: this is when he has completed five<br>\
years: then the term إِبْدَآءٌ is applied to him as<br>\
before described: then he is [also said to be]<br>\
قَارِحٌ. (TA from the “Kitáb el-Kheyl” of AO.)<br>\
[See also 1.]<br>\
5<br>\
تحفّر (tropical:)  It (a torrent) made hollows in the<br>\

of the dial. of the Benoo-Asad, and the worse<br>\
of the two forms, (S,) said by IKt to be a bad<br>\
form, (TA,) and by ISk to be a vulgar mispronunciation, which is attributed to his not<br>\
having heard the dial. of the Benoo-Asad, (Msb,)<br>\
(tropical:)  A scaling (سُلَاق) in the roots of the teeth:<br>\
(Yaakoob, S, K:) or a rottenness, or an unsound<br>\

reason of a scaling of those parts: (Msb:) or<br>\
what adheres to the teeth, externally and internally: (Az:) or an erosion of the roots of the<br>\
teeth by a yellow incrustation between those parts<br>\
and the gum, externally and internally, pressing<br>\

be not quickly removed: (Sh:) or a cankering of<br>\
the teeth: (A:) or a yellowness upon the teeth:<br>\
(IDrd, IKh, K:) or حَفْرٌ signifies a pimple, or<br>\

[i. e. a hollow, cavity, pit, hole, trench, ditch, or<br>\
furrow, dug, or excavated, in the ground: and<br>\
any hollow, or cavity, in the ground, whether made<br>\
by digging or (assumed tropical:)  natural: a burrow:] as also<br>\
↓ حَفِيرَةٌ, (Mgh, Msb, K,) which is of the measure<br>\
فَعِيلَةٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولَةٌ: (Msb:)<br>\
pl. of the former حُفَرٌ; (S, Msb;) and of the<br>\
latter حَفَائِرُ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also حَفِيرٌ.<br>\
حَفِيرٌ is of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the<br>\

-b2-  See also this last word. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also,<br>\
(IAar, S, A, K,) and ↓ حَفِيرَةٌ and ↓ حَفْرٌ, (A,) [or<br>\
↓ حَفَرٌ, q. v., and ↓ حُفْرَةٌ, as is shown by an explanation of its pl. (حُفَرٌ) in the Ham p. 562,]<br>\

حَفَّارٌ A grave-digger. (K.)<br>\
حَافرٌ, [Digging: a digger. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,] The<br>\
حافر of a beast, (دَابَّة, S, K,) i. e., of a horse, or<br>\
mule, or ass; (TA;) [namely, the hoof; a solid<br>\
hoof;] as though it dug the ground by reason of<br>\
the vehemence of its tread upon it; (Msb;) a<br>\
subst., like كَاهِلٌ and غَارِبٌ: (TA:) pl. حَوَافِرُ.<br>\
(S, A, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, by a synecdoche,] خُفٌّ<br>\

―<br>\
-b4-  حَافِرٌ is also applied to (tropical:)  The foot of a man,<br>\
(S, TA,) when it is meant to be characterized as<br>\

-b5-  ↓ النَّقْدُ عِنْدَ الحَافِرَةِ, (S, A, K,)<br>\
and الحَافِرِ, (A, K,) is a prov., (S,) meaning,<br>\
(tropical:)  The payment in ready money is on the occasion<br>\
of the first sentence spoken (Yaakoob, T, * S, K)<br>\
by the seller, when he says “ I have sold to thee ”<br>\
[such a thing]. (T.) The origin of the saying<br>\
was this: horses were the most excellent (K) and<br>\
precious (TA) of the things that they possessed;<br>\
and they used not to sell them on credit: a man<br>\
used to say the words above to another; meaning<br>\
that its hoof should not remove until he received<br>\
its price: (K:) and he who says عند الحافرة<br>\
(since he makes الحافر to mean the beast, الدَّابَّة,<br>\
itself, and since its use in this sense is frequent<br>\
without the mention of ذَات [prefixed to it],) subjoins to it the sign [ة] of the fem. gender to show<br>\
that ذَاتِ الحَافِرِ is meant by this name. (TA.)<br>\
Or they used to say this on the occasion of racing<br>\
and betting: and the meaning is, when the horse&#39;s<br>\
hoof first falls upon the dug ground [at the goal]:<br>\
(Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, Az, K:) ↓ حَافِرَةٌ, (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás,)<br>\
or حَافِرٌ, (K,) signifying dug ground; (Abu-l-<br>\
&#39;Abbás, K; *) ground that is dug by a horse&#39;s<br>\
feet; (Har p. 653;) like as one says مَآءٌ دَافِقٌ,<br>\
meaning مَدْفُوقٌ. (TA.) Lth says that the saying<br>\
means, when thou buyest it, thou dost not quit<br>\
thy place until thou payest ready money. (TA.)<br>\
This was its origin: then it came to be so often<br>\
said as to be used with reference to any priority.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [Thus,] ↓ حَافِرَةٌ signifies (tropical:)  The original<br>\
state or constitution of a thing; that wherein it<br>\
was created: and the returning in a thing, so that<br>\
the end thereof is brought back to its beginning.<br>\
(K.) It is said in the Kur [lxxix. 10], أَئِنَّا<br>\
↓ لَمَرْدُودُونَ فِى الحَافِرَةِ, i. e., (tropical:)  Shall we indeed be<br>\
restored to our first state? (S:) i. e., to life?<br>\
(Fr:) or to the present world, as we were: (IAar:)<br>\
or to our first creation, after our death. (TA.)<br>\
IAar cites the following verse:<br>\
عَلَى صَلَعٍ وَشَيْبٍ أَحَافِرَةً<br>\
مَعَاذَ اللّٰهِ مِنْ سَفِهٍ وَعَارِ<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  Shall I return to my first state, wherein<br>\
I was in my youth, when I indulged in amatory<br>\
conversation, and silly and youthful conduct, after<br>\
hoariness, and baldness of the fore part of my head?<br>\
[I beg God to preserve me from lightwittedness<br>\
and shameful conduct.] (S.) One says also,<br>\
↓ رَجَعَ إِلَى حَافِرَتِهِ, (A,) and حَافِرِهِ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He became old and decrepit: (A, TA:) [as though he<br>\
returned to his first state; or became in a state of<br>\
second childishness.] And اِلْتَقَوْا فَاقْتَتَلُوا عِنْدَ<br>\
↓ الحَافِرَةِ (S, A, K) and الحَافِرِ (A) (tropical:)  They met,<br>\
and fought one another at the first of their meeting. (S, K.) And ↓ فَعَلَ كَذَا عِنْدَ الحَافِرَةِ and<br>\
الحَافِرِ (tropical:)  He did so at the first, without delay.<br>\
(TA.) And ↓ رَجَعَ عَلَى حَافِرَتِهِ (tropical:)  He returned by<br>\
the way by which he had come: (T, S:) or by<br>\
which he had come forth. (K.)<br>\

digging (A, K, TA) of the same kind as a مسحاة:<br>\

p. 665.)<br>\
مِحْفَرَةٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
طُرُقٌ مُحَفَّرَةٌ [app. Roads much furrowed by the<br>\
feet of beasts or men: see حَجِيجٌ]. (L and K in<br>\
art. حج.)<br>\
مِحْفَارٌ: see مِحْفَرٌ.<br>\
مَحْفُورٌ [i. q. حَفِيرٌ as meaning Dug: see the<br>\
latter.] ―<br>\
-b2-  فَمُ فُلَانٍ مَحْفُورٌ [and أَسْنَانُهُ مَحْفُورَةٌ]<br>\
(tropical:)  The teeth of such a one are affected with what<br>\
is termed حَفْرٌ or حَفَرٌ. (S, TA.) And صَبِىٌّ مَحْفُورٌ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A child having a pimple, or small pustule, in the<br>\
gum. (El-Wá&#39;ee.)<br>\
فُلَانٌ أَرْوَغُ مِنْ يَرْبُوعٍ مُحَافِرٍ Such a one is more<br>\
elusive than a jerboa that goes so deep into his<br>\
hole that he cannot be dug out. (A, TA.)<br>\
