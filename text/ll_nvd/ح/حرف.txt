of the notch of an arrow; (Msb;) and the edge<br>\
of a sword: (L, TA:) pl. [of mult. حُرُوفٌ, and<br>\
of pauc.] أَحْرُفٌ. (TA.) Hence, (S,) [A point,<br>\
a ridge, a brow, and a ledge, of a mountain:] the<br>\
pointed, sharp, or edged, summit of a mountain:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) a projecting portion in the side of<br>\
a mountain, in form like a small دُكَّان [i. e.<br>\
bench] or the like: and a portion in the summit<br>\
of a mountain, having a thin edge, or ridge, rising<br>\
above the upper part of the back: (Sh, TA:) pl.<br>\
(of the word thus used in relation to a mountain,<br>\
TA) حِرَفٌ; (Fr, S, Msb, K;) accord. to Fr, (Msb,)<br>\
the only instance of the kind except طِلَلٌ as pl. of<br>\
طَلٌّ. (Msb, K.) [Hence, also,] A nib, of a<br>\
writing-reed, obliquely cut: so in the phrase قَلَمٌ<br>\
لَا حَرْفَ لَهُ, in the S and K in art. جزم, a writingreed not having a nib obliquely cut. (TA in that<br>\
art. [See 2 in the present art.]) And حَرْفَا الرَّأْسِ<br>\
The two lateral halves of the head. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence, also, the phrase] فُلَانٌ عَلَى حَرْفٍ مِنْ<br>\
أَمْرِهِ [and بِحَرْفٍ مِنْهُ (see 3, first sentence,)] Such<br>\
a one is [standing] aloof with respect to his affair,<br>\
(عَلَى نَاحِيَةٍ مِنْهُ, ISd, TA,) [in suspense,] waiting,<br>\
and looking to the result, if he see, in regarding it<br>\
from one side, what he likes; (TA;) turning<br>\
from it if he see what does not please him. (ISd,<br>\
TA.) The saying, in the Kur xxii. 11, وَمِنَ النَّاسِ<br>\
مَنْ يَعْبُدُ اللّٰهَ عَلَى حَرْفٍ means And of men is he<br>\
who serves God standing aloof with respect to<br>\
religion, in a fluctuating state, like him who is in<br>\
the outskirts of the army, who, if sure of victory<br>\
and spoil, stands firm, and otherwise flees: (Ksh,<br>\
Bd: *) or the meaning is, who serves God in doubt,<br>\
or suspense, (Zj, K, Jel,) being unsteady like him<br>\
who alights and abides upon the حَرْف [i. e. point,<br>\
or ridge, or brow,] of a mountain: (Jel:) or in a<br>\
state of disquietude respecting his case; (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Arafeh, K;) i. e. not entering into the religion<br>\
firmly, or steadily: (K:) or who serves God in<br>\
one mode of circumstances; i. e. when in ample<br>\
circumstances, and not when straitened in circumstances; (Az, S, K;) as though good fortune and<br>\
plenty were one side, and an evil state were another<br>\
side: (Az, TA:) [hence,] حَرْفٌ sometimes signifies a mode, or manner, and a way. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
A letter of the alphabet: pl. حُرُوفٌ: (S, Msb,<br>\
K:) the letters being thus called because they are<br>\
the extremities of the word [and of the syllable].<br>\
(Kull.) The saying of the lawyers, تُبْطَلُ الصَّلَاةَ<br>\
بِحَرْفٍ مُفْهِمٍ [Prayer is made null by a significant letter] means only by an imperative of a<br>\
verb of which the first and last radical letters are<br>\
infirm; such as فِ from وَفَى, and قِ from وَقَى,<br>\
and the like. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  As a grammatical term,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [A particle; i. e.] what is used to express a<br>\
meaning, and is not a noun nor a verb: every<br>\
other definition of it is bad: (K:) pl. حُرُوفٌ.<br>\
(Msb, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  A word [absolutely: often<br>\
used in this sense in lexicons &amp;c.]. (Kull.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
A dialect, an idiom, or a mode of expression, peculiar to certain of the Arabs: pl. [of pauc.]<br>\
أَحْرُفٌ: so in the saying (of Mohammad, TA)<br>\
نَزَلَ القُرْآنُ عَلَى سَبْعَةِ أَحْرُفٍ The Kur-án has<br>\
been revealed according to seven dialects, of the<br>\
dialects of the Arabs: (A&#39;Obeyd, Az, IAth,<br>\
K:) or this means, according to seven modes,<br>\
or manners, (Mgh, Msb,) of reading: whence<br>\
فُلَانٌ يَقْرَأُ بِحَرْفِ ابْنِ مَسْعُودٍ Such a one reads<br>\
in the manner of reading of Ibn-Mes&#39;ood.<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  Applied to a she-camel, (assumed tropical:)  Lean, or<br>\
light of flesh; or lean, and lank in the belly;<br>\
(S, K;) and firm, strong, or hardy; likened to<br>\
the حَرْف of a mountain; (S;) or to the حرف of a<br>\
sword, (Z, O, TA,) in respect of her leanness, or<br>\
thinness, and her sharpness and effectiveness in<br>\
pace; (Z, TA;) or to a letter of the alphabet,<br>\
meaning the letter ا, in respect of her leanness:<br>\
(TA:) or excellent, or high-bred, or strong and<br>\
light and swift, sharp and effective in pace, rendered lean by journeyings; likened to the حرف<br>\
of a sword: (L:) or emaciated: (S, K:) so As<br>\
used to say: (S:) but this is inconsistent with<br>\
Dhu-r-Rummeh&#39;s description of a she-camel by<br>\
the epithets جُمَالِيَّةٌ حَرْفٌ سِنَادٌ: (TA:) [see حَرِيثَةٌ:]<br>\
or [in the CK “ and ”] great; big; of great size;<br>\
(K, TA;) likened to the حرف of a mountain:<br>\
(TA:) it is applied only to a she-camel: one may<br>\
not say جَمَلٌ حَرْفٌ. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
حُرْفٌ and ↓ حِرْفَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ حُرْفَةٌ (Mgh, K)<br>\
and ↓ حِرَافٌ (TA) Ill-fatedness; privation of prosperity; or the being denied prosperity; syn. حِرْمَانٌ<br>\
[as inf. n. of حُرِمَ]: (K, TA:) lack of good fortune,<br>\
so that one has no increase of his cattle or other<br>\
property: (S:) debarment from the means of<br>\
subsistence. (Mgh.) Hence the saying of &#39;Omar,<br>\
أَحَدِهِمْ أَشَدُّ عَلَىَّ مِنْ عَيْلَتِهِ ↓ لِحِرْفَةُ, (S, K,) or,<br>\
accord. to one reading, ↓ لَحُرْفَةُ, (TA,) [Verily<br>\
the ill-fatedness of any one of them is more distressing to me than his poverty:] i. e., the supplying the wants of the poor man is easier to me<br>\
than the making the bad to thrive: or the meaning<br>\
is, the want of the means of gaining subsistence by<br>\
any one of them, and grief on that account, is<br>\
more distressing to me than his poverty: so in the<br>\
Nh. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  الحُرْفُ A certain grain, resembling<br>\
الخَرْدَل [or mustard]; (Az, Msb, TA;) called by<br>\
the vulgar, (AHn, TA,) or in the dial. of El-<br>\

or الرَّشَادُ: (Msb:) n. un. with ة, (TA,) applied<br>\
to a single grain thereof. (Msb.) [See art. رشد.]<br>\

حِرْفَةٌ A craft, or handicraft, (S, K, TA,) by<br>\

of gain; any habitual work or occupation of a<br>\
man; because he turns (يَنْحَرِفُ, K, i. e. يَمِيلُ,<br>\
TA) to it; (K, TA;) a subst. from اِحْتَرَفَ: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) pl. حِرَفٌ. (TA.)<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  It is mostly used by foreigners as meaning A<br>\
companion in drinking: and by most of the Turks,<br>\

another by this epithet, he is angry. (TA.)<br>\
حَرَافَةٌ The quality, or property, of burning, or<br>\
biting, the tongue; acritude. (S, Msb, TA.)<br>\
حِرِّيفٌ, from الحُرْفُ, Burning, or biting, to the<br>\

to an onion, and to other things: one should not<br>\
say حَرِّيفٌ. (S, TA.)<br>\
مَحْرِفٌ A place to which to turn away, or back,<br>\
from a thing. (AO, S, K.) So in the saying,<br>\
مَالِى عَنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ مَحْرِفٌ [I have no place to<br>\
which to turn away, or back, from this thing].<br>\
(AO, S, K. *) ―<br>\
