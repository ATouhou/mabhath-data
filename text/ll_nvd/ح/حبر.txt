حُبُورٌ and ↓ حَبْرٌ, (S, K,) or ↓ حِبْرٌ, with kesr,<br>\
(Msb,) and ↓ حَبَرٌ, which last occurs in a verse of<br>\

↓ حَبْرَةٌ (A, K) and ↓ حَبَرَةٌ, (K,) Happiness, joy,<br>\
or gladness: (S, Msb, K:) or the first signifies<br>\
cheerfulness; i. e. pleasure, or delight, and dilatation of the heart, which has a visible effect in<br>\
the aspect: (TA voce سُرُورٌ:) and the same word<br>\
(IAth) and ↓ حَبْرَةٌ (Az, IAth, K) and ↓ حَبْرٌ, (K,)<br>\
a state of ease and plenty; syn. نَعْمَةٌ: (IAth,<br>\
K: [in the CK and in a MS. copy of the K, erroneously, نِعْمَة:]) or a state of complete, or perfect, ease and plenty: (Az:) and ampleness of<br>\
the circumstances of life. (IAth.) [See 1. Hence<br>\
the saying,] بَعْدَهَا عَبْرَةٌ ↓ كُلُّ حَبْرَةٍ [After every<br>\
state of happiness, or joy, &amp;c., is a tear]. (A.)<br>\
حَبِيرٌ A [garment of the kind called] بُرْد, variegated, (مُوَشَّىِ,) (K,) [i. e.] striped. (TA.) One<br>\
says بُرْدٌ حَبِيرٌ and بُرْدُ حَبِيرٍ. (TA.) [See also<br>\
حِبَرَةٌ. Hence the saying,] لَبِسَ حَبِيرَ الحُبُورِ وَاسْتَوَى<br>\
عَلَى سَرِيرِ السُّرُورِ (tropical:)  [He clad himself with the<br>\
mantle of cheerfulness, and seated himself firmly<br>\
upon the couch of happiness]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
applies to a garment, or piece of cloth, New:<br>\
(S, K:) and soft and new; (K, TA;) applied to<br>\
the same; (TA;) and so ↓ حَبِرٌ; (K;) which<br>\
also signifies a soft thing: (TA:) pl. of the<br>\
former حُبْرٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Clouds; syn. سَحَابٌ:<br>\
(S:) or clouds spotted (مُنَمَّرٌ); (K;) in which<br>\
one sees what resembles تَنْمِير, by reason of the<br>\
abundance of their water; but Er-Riyáshee disapproves of this. (TA.)<br>\
حُبَارَى [a word respecting which J says,] its<br>\
alif [written ى] is not the fem. alif nor the alif<br>\
of quasi-coordination; [as F says of the alif of<br>\
قَبَعْثَرًى, though he finds fault with J for saying<br>\
thus of the alif of حُبَارَى; (see أَلِفُ التَّكْثِيرِ, in<br>\
art. ا)] the name [says J] being only composed<br>\
with it, so that it is as it were a part of the word<br>\
itself, which is imperfectly decl. when determinate and when indeterminate; i. e., without<br>\
tenween: (S:) but its alif is the fem. alif; for<br>\
were it not so, it would be perfectly decl.; (K;)<br>\
and J says that it is imperfectly decl.: (TA:)<br>\
and his saying that the alif is [as it were] a part<br>\
of the word itself is a strange expression, for<br>\
which it would be difficult to give an answer,<br>\
and which therefore requires not exorbitance:<br>\
but “ it is sufficient excellence for a man that his<br>\
faults may be counted: ” (M:) [A species of<br>\
bustard;] a certain bird, (S, Msb, K,) well<br>\
known, of the form of the goose, with a dustcolour upon its head and belly, and the back and<br>\
wings of which are for the most part of the<br>\
colour of the quail; (Msb;) or it is a long-necked<br>\
bird, of an ash-colour, of the form of the goose,<br>\
with a beak somewhat long, and that is preyed<br>\
upon, but does not itself prey: Az says that it<br>\
does not drink water, and that it lays its eggs<br>\
in distant sands: [the truth is, that it drinks<br>\
seldom: the male bird has a pouch, extending<br>\
from beneath the tongue to the breast, said to be<br>\
large enough to contain seven quarts of water;<br>\
and it has been supposed by some that he fills<br>\
this with water for the supply of himself and his<br>\
mate:] and Az further says, We used, when we<br>\
journeyed, to proceed in the mountains of EdDahnà, and sometimes we picked up in one day<br>\
between four and eight of its eggs: it lays four<br>\
eggs, of a bluish colour, more delicious in taste<br>\
than those of the domestic hen and than those of the<br>\
ostrich: and others say that it brings its food<br>\
from a greater distance than any other bird;<br>\
sometimes from a distance of many days&#39; journey:<br>\
also, that it is constantly provided with a thin<br>\
excrement, or dung, which it voids upon the hawk<br>\
when pursued by the latter; thus saving itself,<br>\
by preventing the hawk from continuing its flight,<br>\
and, as some say, causing its feathers to drop off:<br>\
whence the prov., أَسْلَحُ مِنْ حُبَارَى: [see art.<br>\
سلح:] (TA:) حُبَارَى is applied alike to the<br>\
male and the female, and used as sing. and pl.:<br>\
(S, K:) but it has pl. forms, (TA,) namely,<br>\
حُبَارَيَاتٌ (S, Msb, K, TA) and حُبَارَاتٌ: (TA:)<br>\
accord. to Sb, it has not حَبَارٍ, [in the TA incorrectly written حَبَارِى, as though it had the<br>\
article ال prefixed to it, or were prefixed to another<br>\
noun,] nor حَبَائِرُ, [though both of these are mentioned as pls. of it in several of the grammars<br>\
of the Arabs,] in order to distinguish between<br>\
حُبَارَى and nouns of the measures فَعْلَآءُ and فِعَالَةٌ<br>\
and the like. (TA.) It is said in a prov.,<br>\
وَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ قَدْ يُحِبُّ وَلَدَهْ<br>\
حَتَّى الحُبَارَى وَتَطِيرُ عَنَدَهُ<br>\
[And everything certainly loves its offspring:<br>\
even the bustard; and it flies by its side]: (S,<br>\
Mgh: *) [in the TA, وَيَدِفُّ عَنَدَهْ:] it flies by the<br>\
side of its young one to teach it to fly before its<br>\
wings have grown, because of its stupidity: (TA:)<br>\
the حبارى is thus specially mentioned because<br>\
it is proverbial for stupidity, and, notwithstanding its stupidity, loves its offspring, and teaches<br>\
it to fly. (S, Mgh.) Another prov. is, فُلَانٌ مَيِّتْ<br>\
كَمَدَ الحُبَارَى [Such a one is dying with the concealed grief of the bustard]: because the حبارى<br>\
moults with other birds, but its new feathers are<br>\
slow in coming: so when the other birds fly, it<br>\
is unable to do so, and dies of concealed grief.<br>\

مًحْبَرَةٌ, (Msb, K,) which is the most approved<br>\
