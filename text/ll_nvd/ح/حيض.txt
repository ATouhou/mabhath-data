حَاضَتْ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor. تَحِيضُ, inf. n.<br>\
حَيْضٌ and مَحِيضٌ (S, Msb, K) and مَحَاضٌ,<br>\
(Aboo-Is-hák, K,) said of a woman, (S, A, Msb,<br>\
K,) She menstruated; i. e. her blood flowed;<br>\
(A;) or [rather] blood came forth from her<br>\
womb; (Mgh;) [not in consequence of disease<br>\
nor of childbirth, nor before she had attained to<br>\
puberty; as explained in the law-books of the<br>\
Muslims;] as also ↓ تحيّضت: or this latter signifies she likened herself to the حَائِض. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also She attained the age of menstruation. (TA.)<br>\
[See حَائِضٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  حَاضَتِ السَّمُرَةُ, (S, A, Msb,) aor.<br>\
as above, (Msb,) inf. n. حَيْضٌ, (S, Msb,) (tropical:)  The<br>\
سمرة [or gum-acacia-tree] flowed with, (S,) or<br>\
emitted, (A,) a matter resembling blood; (S, A;)<br>\
flowed with its gum: (Msb:) the matter which<br>\
it emits is called دُوَدِم; and is applied to the head<br>\
of a new-born infant to scare away the jánn, or<br>\
genii. (A, TA: [but in a copy of the A, and in<br>\
one instance in the TA, الشَّجَرَةُ is put in the place<br>\
of السَّمُرَةُ, app. by mistake.]) [I have marked this<br>\
signification as tropical on the authority of the A<br>\
and TA; but the author of the Msb has commenced the art. with it; and shows that he held<br>\
the opinion, which some others have shared with<br>\
him, that it is the primary signification.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
حَاضَ السَّيْلُ (assumed tropical:)  The torrent overflowed; or poured<br>\
out, or forth, from fulness; or ran; syn. فَاضَ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
حيّض المَرْأَةَ He attributed حَيْض [or menstruation] to the woman. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  حيّض جَارِيَتَهُ,<br>\
(TK,) inf. n. تَحْيِيضٌ, (Sgh, K,) Tempore men-<br>\
struorum inivit ancillam suam. (Sgh, K, TK.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  حيّض المَآءَ, (TK,) inf. n. as above, (K,) (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
made the water to flow. (K, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تحيّضت: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also She abstained form<br>\
prayer (الصلاة) during the days of her حَيْض [or<br>\
menstruation]; (S, Msb, K, TA;) waiting for<br>\
the stopping of the blood: (TA:) or she abstained,<br>\
and did as the حَائِض does: (A, * Mgh:) or she<br>\
reckoned herself حائض, and did as the حائض<br>\
does. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
اُسْتُحِيضَتْ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) in the pass.<br>\
form, (Msb,) with damm to the ت, (Mgh,) [as<br>\
though originally signifying She was reckoned to<br>\
be menstruating,] found in the handwriting of<br>\
Aboo-Zekereeyà اِسْتَحْيَضَتْ, (TA,) [which I hold<br>\
to be a mistake, as being at variance with general<br>\
usage,] She continued to have a flow of blood (S,<br>\
Mgh) after her days [of menstruation]: (S:) or<br>\
she had an exuberance of blood [flowing from the<br>\
vagina]; not what is termed الحَيْض: (Msb:) or<br>\
her blood flowed without stopping, not on certain<br>\
days, nor from the vein [or veins] of menstruation,<br>\
but from a vein called العَاذِلُ. (TA.)<br>\
حَيْضٌ [an inf. n. of 1: explained in the KT as<br>\
applied to The menstrual blood itself; which seems<br>\
to have been more properly called حِيضَةٌ and<br>\
مَحِيضٌ and حِيَاضٌ: though what here follows<br>\
may be considered as rendering it probable that<br>\
حَيْضٌ was also used in this sense in the classical<br>\
times, for دَمُ حَيْضٍ]. ―<br>\
-b2-  حَيْضُ السَّمُرِ (assumed tropical:)  A thing<br>\
which flows from the سَمُر [or gum-acacia-trees],<br>\
resembling [what is called] دَمُ الغَزَالِ. (Mgh.)<br>\
[See also 1.]<br>\
حَيْضَةٌ A single time, or turn, of menstruation,<br>\
or of the flow of the menstrual blood: (S, * A, *<br>\
Mgh, Msb: *) pl. حِيَضٌ; (A, Msb;) like as بِدَرٌ<br>\
is pl. of بَدْرَةٌ, and ضِيَعٌ of ضَيْعَةٌ, and حِيَدٌ of حَيْدَةٌ,<br>\
and خِيَمٌ of خَيْمَةٌ; though by rule it should be<br>\
حَيْضَاتٌ. (Msb.) You say, حَاضَتْ حَيْضَةً وَاحِدَةً<br>\
[She menstruated one single time of menstruation]:<br>\
and حَيْضَةً طَوِيلَةً [a long single time thereof]:<br>\
and ثَلَاثَ حِيَضٍ [three single times thereof]. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  As used by the professors of practical law,<br>\
The accustomed days thereof. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A single flow [of water &amp;c.]: pl. حَيْضَاتٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
حِيضَةٌ [Menstruation;] the subst. from حَاضَتِ<br>\
المَرْأَةُ: (S, K, TA:) or a mode, or manner, or<br>\
state, of حَيْض [or menstruating]: (Msb:) or<br>\
the state (Mgh, TA) of the حَائِض, (TA,) which<br>\
is one of avoidance (Mgh, TA) of prayer and<br>\
fasting and the like: (Mgh:) pl. حِيَضٌ. (S,<br>\
Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The menstrual blood; the blood<br>\
of menstruation; and so ↓ مَحِيضٌ and ↓ حِيَاضٌ.<br>\
(TA.) [See also حَيْضٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The piece of<br>\
rag which the حَائِض binds over her vulva; (S,<br>\
Mgh, * Msb, * K;) and so ↓ مَحِيضةٌ: (S:) which<br>\
latter also signifies (assumed tropical:)  a piece of rag thrown away:<br>\
(TA:) pl. of the latter, مَحَايِضُ. (S, TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
حَيْضِىٌّ Menstrual; of, or relating to, menstruation.]<br>\
حِيَاضٌ: see حِيضَةٌ.<br>\
حَائِضٌ, applied to a woman, [Menstruating;]<br>\
act. part. n. from حَاضَتْ; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;)<br>\
thus, [without ة,] because it is an epithet of particular application [to a female]; (Msb;) and<br>\
with ء, being like قَائِمٌ and صَائِمٌ &amp;c.; (TA;)<br>\
[because the ى in its verb suffers alteration;]<br>\
and in like manner حَائِضَةٌ also, (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K,) on the authority of Fr: (S:) pl. (of the<br>\
former, Msb) حُيَّضٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) like as<br>\
رُكَّعٌ is pl. of رَاكِعٌ, (Msb,) and حَاضَةٌ, like as<br>\
حَاكَةٌ is pl. of حَائِكٌ, (TA,) and of the latter,<br>\
حَائِضَاتٌ, (Msb,) or حَوَائِضُ. (S, Mgh, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In<br>\
a certain trad., in which it is said that God will<br>\
not accept the prayer of a حَائِض unless she be<br>\
[attired] with a خِمَار [or head-covering], this does<br>\
not mean one who is menstruating while actually<br>\
occupied by prayer, (Msb, TA, *) but (assumed tropical:)  One who<br>\
has attained to the age of menstruation; (TA;)<br>\
or one who has attained to womanhood: (Mgh:)<br>\
or it has not this meaning; for if it had, one would<br>\
understand that a girl not arrived at puberty<br>\
might pray with her head uncovered, which is not<br>\
the case; but it means (tropical:)  [one of] the menstruating<br>\
kind, whether she have attained to puberty or<br>\
not; as though the term female had been used in<br>\
its place. (Msb.)<br>\
مَحِيضٌ is a simple subst. as well as an inf. n.:<br>\
(Zj, K:) as the former, it is a n. of place; and as<br>\
such it is [said to be] used in the Kur ii. 222; meaning A woman&#39;s مَأْتًى; (Zj;) her فَرْج; (Mgh;) because it is the place of الحَيْض. (Zj, Mgh.) Some<br>\
say that حَوْضٌ is hence derived; because the<br>\
water flows to the حوض: (Az, K:) for the Arabs<br>\
put و in the place of ى, and ى in that of و.<br>\
(Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also a n. of time [signifying<br>\
The time of menstruating]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also<br>\
حِيضَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b4-  When it is a simple subst., it has a pl.,<br>\
namely مَحَايِضُ. (TA.)<br>\
مَحِيضَةٌ: see حِيضَةٌ.<br>\
مُسْتَحَاضَةٌ A woman continuing to have a flow<br>\
of blood after her days [of menstruation]: (S:)<br>\
or having an exuberance of blood [flowing from<br>\
her vagina]; not what is termed الحَيْض: (Msb:)<br>\
or having her blood flowing without stopping, not<br>\
on certain days, nor from the vein [or veins]<br>\
of menstruation, but from a vein called العَاذِلُ.<br>\
