حَشِىَ, [aor. يَحْشَى,] inf. n. حَشًى, He (a<br>\
man walking quickly, and one speaking with<br>\
sharpness, or hastiness, of temper, TA) breathed<br>\
short, or unintermittedly; panted for breath;<br>\
or was out of breath. (S, K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 3.<br>\
2<br>\
حشّى, (TA,) inf. n. تَحْشِيَةٌ, (KL, TA,) He<br>\
made a حَاشِيَة to a garment, or piece of cloth.<br>\
(KL.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,] (assumed tropical:)  He wrote a note or<br>\
comment, or notes or comments, upon the margin,<br>\
or margins, of a book: (KL, TA:) in this sense<br>\
it is vulgar [or post-classical]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [Also,<br>\
app., He, or it, caused one to breathe short or<br>\
unintermittedly, to pant for breath, or to be out<br>\
of breath: see مُحَشِّيَةُ الكِلَابِ, below.]<br>\
3<br>\
حاشاهُ مِنْهُمْ, (IAmb, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. مُحَاشَاةٌ,<br>\
(KL,) He set him aside as excluded from the description of them; [excluded him from them;]<br>\
did not include him among them: (IAmb, TA:)<br>\
from حَشًى meaning the “side” of a thing: (Az,<br>\
TA;) he excepted him from them; as also ↓ تحشّاهُ.<br>\
(Lh, K, TA.) You say, شَتَمْتُهُمْ وَ مَا حَاشَيْتُ مِنْهُمْ<br>\
أَحَدًا and ↓ ما تَحَشَّيْتُ, i. e. [I reviled them and]<br>\
I did not say [of any one of them] حَاشَى لِفُلَانٍ<br>\
[Far is such a one from being included among<br>\
those of whom I speak! or from any cause of<br>\
reproach!]; or I did not except, of them, any<br>\
one. (Lh, TA. [The same saying is repeated in<br>\
the TA, in the supplement to this art. of the K,<br>\
but with the substitution of حشيت for حاشيت;<br>\
perhaps by a mistake of the copyist: or it may be<br>\
inferred from a statement of Fr and IAmb, which<br>\
will be found below, that one also says ما<br>\
↓ حَشَيْتُ.]) And En-Nábighah [Edh-Dhubyánee]<br>\
says, (Mbr, S.)<br>\
وَ لَا أَرَى فَاعِلًا فِى النَّاسِ يُشْبِهُهُ<br>\
وَ مَا أُحَاشِى مِنَ الأَقْوَامِ مِنْ أَحَدِ<br>\
[And I shall not see an actor among mankind<br>\
resembling him; and I do not except, of the companies of men, any one]: which shows حَاشِى to<br>\
be a verb perfectly inflected. (Mbr, S, Mughnee.)<br>\
And hence the trad. of the Prophet, قَال أُسَامَةُ<br>\
أَحَبُّ النَّاسِ إِلَىَّ مَا حَاشَى فَاطِمَةَ, i. e. [He said,<br>\
Usámeh is the most beloved of men to me:] he did<br>\
not except Fátimeh: ما being here a negative;<br>\
not, as Ibn-Málik imagines, supposing this<br>\
clause to be of the words of the Prophet, the ما<br>\
which, with a verb following it, conveys the meaning of an inf. n. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b2-  حَاشَى also denotes<br>\
exception as a particle, or as a verb (S, Mughnee)<br>\
having but one tense and no inf. n., (Mughnee,)<br>\
according as it governs a gen. or an accus. case. (S.)<br>\
You say, زَيْدٍ ↓ ضَرَبْتُهُمْ حَاشَى [I beat them, except Zeyd], using it as a particle; and ضربتهم<br>\
حاشى زَيْدًا, using it as a verb. (S, I &#39;Ak * p. 169.)<br>\
And sometimes one says, قَامَ القَوْمُ مَا حَاشَى زَيْدًا<br>\
[The party stood, except Zeyd]; (Mughnee, I&#39; Ak<br>\
p. 169;) like مَا خَلَا; though Ibn-Málik [like<br>\
Sb] disallows it: (I&#39; Ak:) this being shown to be<br>\
allowable by the saying of the poet,<br>\
رَأَيْتُ النَّاسَ مَا حَاشَى قُرَيْشًا<br>\
فَإِنَّا نَحْنُ أَفْضَلُهُمْ فَعَالَا<br>\
[I have seen mankind, except Kureysh, that we<br>\
are the most excellent of them in conduct].<br>\
(Mughnee, I&#39; Ak p. 170.) The agent of حاشى<br>\
[used as a verb having but one tense and no inf. n.]<br>\
is a pronoun implied, relating to the inf. n. of the<br>\
preceding verb, or to its act. part. n., or to a portion of what is meant by the [preceding] general<br>\
noun: so that when one says, قَامَ القَوْمُ حَاشَى<br>\
زَيْدًا, the meaning is, [The party stood, but] their<br>\
standing, or the stander of them, or a portion of<br>\
them, was apart from Zeyd. (Mughnee.) [In the<br>\
K, its use as a verb of this kind is not mentioned;<br>\
but it is there said to govern the gen. case, like<br>\
حَتَّى.] ―<br>\
-b3-  It also denotes remoteness from imperfection or the like, or freedom therefrom; as in<br>\
the phrase للّٰهِ ↓ حَاشَى [I ascribe unto God remoteness from every imperfection or the like, or<br>\
freedom therefrom; generally implying wonder<br>\
or admiration, so that it may be rendered, how<br>\
far, or how free, is God from every imperfection!]: (Mughnee:) or this phrase means<br>\
مَعَاذَ اللّٰهِ [I seek protection by God; or, as often<br>\
used by late writers, and in the present day, God<br>\
forbid!]; as also للّٰهِ ↓ حَاشَ; (S, K;) the former<br>\
being the original expression: (S:) it occurs,<br>\
read in both these ways, in the Kur xii. 31<br>\
and 51; where it implies wonder at the power of<br>\
God as manifested in the creation of such a person as Joseph. (Ksh, Bd.) Mbr and IJ and the<br>\
Koofees hold that it is a verb; and that, in the<br>\
[latter] verse the meaning is, Joseph hath kept<br>\
aloof from disobedience for the sake of God;<br>\
but such an interpretation as this is not suitable<br>\
in the case of [the former verse,] حَاشَ للّٰهِ مَا هٰذَا<br>\
بَشَرًا: the truth is, that it is a noun, syn. with<br>\
التَنْزِيه or البَرَآءَة, [accord. to different copies of the<br>\
Mughnee, meaning تَنْزِيهًا or بَرَآءَةً,] as is shown by<br>\
another reading, للّٰهِ ↓ حَاشًا, with tenween, like<br>\
بَرَآءَةً للّٰهِ; and by the reading of Ibn-Mes&#39;ood,<br>\
اللّٰهِ ↓ حَاشَ, like مَعَاذَ اللّٰهِ: some assert that it is<br>\
a verbal noun, meaning أَتَبَرَّأُ [I assert myself to<br>\
be free, or clear, to God], or تَبَرَّأْتُ [I have asserted myself &amp;c.]; but its being decl. in some<br>\
dials. contradicts this. (Mughnee.) One says<br>\
also, ↓ حَاشَاكَ and لَكَ ↓ حَاشَى [Far art thou from<br>\
being included among those of whom I speak!<br>\
or from any cause of reproach! or the like]; both<br>\
meaning the same. (S, K.) And some of the<br>\
Arabs say ↓ حَشَى, (Fr, IAmb, TA,) dropping the<br>\
ا (IAmb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Sb says, (S, Mughnee,) with<br>\
most of the Basrees, (Mughnee,) that it is only<br>\
a particle governing the gen. case, (S, Mughnee,)<br>\
syn. with إِلَّا; (Mughnee;) because, if it were a<br>\
verb, it would be allowable to make it a connective to مَا, like خَلَا; and this he asserts to be<br>\
not allowable. (S.) Mbr says that it is sometimes<br>\
a verb; as is shown by the verse of En-Nábighah<br>\
cited above; and by the saying حَاشَى لِزَيْدٍ, because a particle cannot be made to precede immediately another particle; and because it suffers<br>\
elision, as in the phrase حَاشَ لِزَيْدٍ, seeing that<br>\
elision takes place in nouns and verbs only,<br>\
exclusively of particles: (S, Mughnee *:) and IJ<br>\
and the Koofees say the like: but Mbr also holds,<br>\
in common with El-Jarmee and El-Mázinee and<br>\
Zj and Akh and AZ and Fr and Aboo-&#39;Amr EshSheybánee, that it is often a particle governing<br>\
the gen. case, and seldom a trans. verb having but<br>\
one tense and no inf. n., because syn. with إِلَّا.<br>\
(Mughnee.)<br>\

تحشّى [He went aside, apart, or aloof, or<br>\
he removed, withdrew, or retired to a distance,]<br>\
is from الحَاشِيَةُ; like تَنَحَّى from النَّاحِيَةُ: (TA:)<br>\
and [↓ تحاشى has a similar meaning:] you say,<br>\
تَحَاشَيْتُ مِنْ كَذَا I kept aloof from, shunned, or<br>\
removed myself far from, such a thing; from<br>\
الحَشَا [or الحَشَى] meaning النَّاحِيَةُ. (Har p. 194.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And تحشّى مِنْهُ; (IAar, K;) and مِنْهُ ↓ حاشى,<br>\
(Har p. 294,) inf. n. مُحَاشَاةٌ; (KL;) He abstained, or refrained, (IAar, K, KL, Har,) from<br>\
him, (IAar, K, Har,) or it, (IAar, KL,) through<br>\
disdain and pride; or he disdained, or scorned,<br>\
or was ashamed of, him, or it. (IAar, K, Har.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And لَا يَتَحَشَّى, (El-Báhilee, TA,) and لا<br>\
↓ يُحَاشِى, (Har p. 294,) He will not care, mind,<br>\
heed, or regard. (El-Báhilee, Har, TA.)<br>\

the waist: and of a woman, هِىَ ضَامِرَةُ الحَشَى:<br>\
and of women, هُنَّ ضَوَامِرُ الأَحْشَآءِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A<br>\

(Z, K, * TA.) You say, أَنَا فِى حَشَاهُ I am in his<br>\
quarter, vicinage, or protection: (Z, K:) [see<br>\
