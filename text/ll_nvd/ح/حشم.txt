cites, from Kutheiyir,<br>\
إِنِّى مَتَى لَمْ يَكُنْ عَطَاؤُهُمَا<br>\

accord. to As, (TA,) [the inf. n.] حُشُومٌ signifies<br>\

(Yoo, TA;) in the K, erroneously, حَشَمَةٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and أَحْشَامٌ; (K;) which IAar thinks to be pl.<br>\
of حَشَمٌ used in a sing. sense; (TA;) [for] this<br>\
word is applied to one [of such persons] as well<br>\
as to a pl. number: (K:) you say, هٰذَا الغُلَامُ<br>\

an event befalls him; (Mgh, Msb;) for which<br>\
reason they are thus called: (S:) or a man&#39;s<br>\
followers; and those on whose account he should<br>\
be angry: (Ham p. 614:) or the حَشَم of a man<br>\
are those who are angry on his account; or those<br>\
on whose account he is angry: (Har p. 164:)<br>\
accord. to ISk, (Msb,) it is a word having a pl.<br>\
signification, and having no proper sing.: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) but some say that it has for its pl. أَحْشَامٌ:<br>\
(Mgh:) and accord. to the K, ↓ حُشَمَآءُ [in the<br>\
CK حَشْمَاء] signifies neighbours and guests; as<br>\
though it were pl. of حَشِيمٌ, like as كُرَمَآءُ is of<br>\
كَرِيمٌ: but [perhaps this should be أَحْشَامٌ; for]<br>\
we find in the M, هٰؤُلَآءِ أَحْشَامِى, meaning These<br>\
are my neighbours, and my guests: (TA:) and<br>\

the explanation of IAar, for which ذُو is erroneously substituted in the copies of the K, TA,)<br>\
consummate shame, shyness, bashfulness, or pudency. (IAar, K, TA.) ―<br>\

-A2-  I. q.<br>\
ذِمَامٌ [app. as meaning protection, safeguard, or<br>\
security of life and property]. (Yoo, K.) So in<br>\
the phrase, لَهُ الحُشْمَةُ [Protection, &amp;c., is due to<br>\
him]. (Yoo, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Relationship. (K.) So in<br>\
the phrase, فِيهِمْ حُشْمَةٌ [Among them is relationship]. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also حَشْمَةٌ.<br>\
حِشْمَةٌ Anger. (As, S, Mgh, Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\

Msb, K;) and a shrinking (Lth, Mgh, K, TA)<br>\
from one&#39;s brother in a place of eating, and in<br>\
seeking, or requesting, a thing that one wants.<br>\
(Lth, Mgh, TA.) It has been asserted, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA,) on the authority of As, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
that it signifies only “anger:” (Mgh, Msb, TA:)<br>\
but several authors have refuted this assertion,<br>\
by showing that it occurs in trads. as meaning<br>\
“shame.” (MF, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The act of annoying a person sitting with one, and saying to him<br>\
what he dislikes; and so ↓ حُشْمَةٌ. (K.)<br>\
حُشَمَآءُ, in the CK حَشْمَاء: see حَشَمٌ.<br>\
حُشُومٌ: see حَشَمٌ, last sentence but one.<br>\
-A2-  It<br>\
is also an inf. n. of 1. (K.)<br>\
حَشِيمٌ, (S, K,) in some of the copies of the S<br>\
حِشِّيمٌ, which is app. a mistake, (TA,) [thus I<br>\
find it in one of my copies of the S,] i. q. ↓ مُحْتَشَمٌ;<br>\
(S, K;) i. e. Regarded with reverence, veneration, respect, honour, awe, or fear; (TA;) applied<br>\
to a man. (S.)<br>\
حَاشِمٌ A man being, or becoming, fat, or in a<br>\
good condition of body, after leanness. (TA.)<br>\
مَحْشُومٌ Angered. (TA.) [But it is implied in<br>\
the S that it signifies Confounded and stupified<br>\
by shame; or ashamed and confounded or stupified, and remaining speechless and motionless.]<br>\
A poet says,<br>\
لَعَمْرُكَ إِنَّ قُرْصَ أَبِى خُبَيْبٍ<br>\
بَطِىْءُ النُّضْجِ مَحْشُومُ الأَكِيلِ<br>\
[By thy life, verily the round cake of bread of<br>\
Aboo-Khubeyb is slow in becoming thoroughly<br>\
baked: the eater is angered, or confounded and<br>\
stupified by shame, &amp;c.]. (S, TA.)<br>\
مُحْتَشَمٌ: see حَشِيمٌ.<br>\
