some add, including to redness: (TA:) or winejars, (A &#39;Obeyd, Nh,) glazed, or varnished, green,<br>\
(Nh,) which used to be carried to El-Medeeneh,<br>\
with wine in them: (A &#39;Obeyd, Nh:) the use of<br>\
which, for preparing نَبِيذ therein, is forbidden in<br>\
a trad., because it quickly became potent in them,<br>\
by reason of the glazing, or varnish; or, as some<br>\
say, because they used to be made of clay kneaded<br>\
with blood and hair; but the former is the right<br>\
reason: afterwards applied to any jars, or pottery: (Nh:) thus some explain it as a sing.;<br>\
(MF;) and the pl. is حَنَاتِمُ: (Az, TA:) others,<br>\
as a pl. [or coll. gen. n.], of which the sing. [or<br>\
n. un.] is with ة: (MF:) some say that the ن is<br>\
augmentative: so says the author of the Msb:<br>\
others, that it is radical. (TA.) [See art. حتم.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Black clouds; (Az, K;) as also [the pl.]<br>\
حَنَاتِمُ: (Az, S, K:) because, with the Arabs,<br>\
السَّوَادُ is [used for] خُضْرَةٌ: (S: [see أَسْوَدُ; and<br>\
see also حَنْتَمٌ in art. حتم:]) or as being likened<br>\
to حَنَاتِم (meaning jars) filled [with water]: (Az,<br>\
TA:) n. un. with ة. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The colocynthplant; (K, TA;) because of its intense greenness:<br>\
n. un. with ة. (TA.)<br>\
