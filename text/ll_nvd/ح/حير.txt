حَارَ, [sec. pers. حِرْتَ,] aor. يَحَارُ, (S, A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) and some say يَحِيرُ, but this is a mistake, (MF,) inf. n. حَيْرَةٌ (S, A, Mgh, K) and حَيَرٌ<br>\
(S, Msb, K) and حَيْرٌ and حَيَرَانٌ, (K,) He was,<br>\
or became, dazzled by a thing at which he looked,<br>\
(T, Msb, K,) so that he turned away his eyes<br>\
from it: this is the primary signification: (T,<br>\
Msb:) and so ↓ تحيّر (A, * Mgh, * K) and ↓ استحار,<br>\
(K,) and حاربَصَرُهُ (A, * TA) and بصره ↓ تحيّر.<br>\
(Mgh, and S and A and K in art. قمر, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And hence, (T, Msb,) He was, or became, confounded, or perplexed, and unable to see his<br>\
right course; (T, Msb, K, * TA;) as also ↓ تحيّر<br>\
(Msb, K) and ↓ استحار. (K.) And حار, (S, A,)<br>\
or حار فِى أَمْرِهِ, (Msb,) i. q. فى امره ↓ تحيّر [He<br>\
was, or became, confounded, &amp;c., in his affair,<br>\
or case]. (S, A.) And [حار (see its part. n.<br>\
حَائِرٌ) and] ↓ تحيّر [and ↓ استحار] He erred, or<br>\
lost his way. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, said of water, (A,<br>\
Msb, K,) and ↓ تحيّر (S, A, K) and ↓ استحار,<br>\
(A, K,) (tropical:)  It became collected, (S, A, K,) and<br>\
stayed, (A,) or went round, (S, K, *) or went to<br>\
and fro, or fluctuated, (Msb, K,) in a place, as<br>\
though it knew not which way to run. (A.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\

right course. (S, * Msb, KL.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Accord. to<br>\
Golius, as on the authority of the KL, حيّر, said<br>\
of water, means (assumed tropical:)  It was whirled round in an<br>\
eddy: but to have this meaning, which I do not<br>\
find in my copy of the KL, the verb should be<br>\
حُيِّرَ.]<br>\

-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  It continued; said of time; (TA;) and in like manner<br>\
it is said of a man. (MF.) And بِهِ ↓ حِيرُوا [if<br>\
not a mistranscription for تَحَيَّرُوا] occurs as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Remain ye therein; referring to a place.<br>\
(TA.) And بِمَكَانٍ ↓ استحار (assumed tropical:)  He alighted and<br>\
