حَاطَ بِهِ, aor. يَحُوطُ: see 4, in three places.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  حَاطَهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor. as above, (S, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. حَوْطٌ (S, Msb, K) and حِيطَةٌ and حِيَاطَةٌ,<br>\
(S, K, TA, [the second and third, in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, with fet-h to the ح, the former of<br>\
them being expressly said in the S and TA, and<br>\
the latter also in the TA, to be with kesr, and<br>\
both being shown in the S to be originally with و,<br>\
i. e. حِوْطَةٌ and حِوَاطَةٌ,]) and حِيَاطٌ is used in<br>\
poetry for the last of these; (TA;) and ↓ حوّطهُ,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. تَحْوِيطٌ; (TA;) and ↓ تحوّطهُ; (K,<br>\
TA; [omitted in the CK;]) He guarded, kept,<br>\
kept safely, protected, or took care of, him, or it;<br>\
(S, Msb, K, TA;) he defended him, or it; (TA;)<br>\
he paid frequent attention to him, or it; (K,<br>\
TA;) he minded, or was regardful of, the things<br>\
that were for his, or its, good. (TA.) You say,<br>\
لَا زِلْتَ فِى حِيَاطَةِ اللّٰهِ Mayest thou not cease to be<br>\
in the protection of God. (TA.) And مَعَ فُلَانٍ<br>\
حِيطَةٌ لَكَ There is with such a one compassion and<br>\
affection for thee: you should not say عَلَيْكَ.<br>\
(S.) And أَحُوطُ عِرْضِى [I guard, or defend, or<br>\
take care of, my honour, or reputation]. (TA.)<br>\
And أَخَاهُ ↓ هُوَ يَتَحَوَّطُ He takes care of, or pays<br>\
frequent attention to, his brother; and undertakes, or superintends, or manages, his affairs.<br>\
(TA.) And حَاطَهُمْ قَصَآءَهُمْ and بِقَصَائِهِمْ He<br>\
fought in their defence. (TA.) [But this is generally meant ironically.] When an affliction<br>\
befalls thee, and thy brother does not guard thee,<br>\
or defend thee, and does not aid thee, one says<br>\
[to thee], حَاطَكَ الفَضَآءَ [so in the TA, app. a<br>\
mistranscription for القَصَآءَ or القَصَا, with which,<br>\
however, it is nearly syn.,] which is used ironically; i. e. He guarded thee,  or defended thee, in<br>\
a distant quarter; meaning, (tropical:)  he did not guard<br>\
thee, or defend thee; for he who guards, or defends, his brother, draws near to him, and supports<br>\
him, or aids him. (A, TA.) [See also 1 in art.<br>\
حبو.] You say also, حَاطُونَا القَصَآءَ, (K,) or القَصَا,<br>\
(TK,) [both are said to be correct in the TA in<br>\
art. قصو, on the authority of Ibn-Wellád,] in<br>\
some of the copies of the K with ف and ض, and<br>\
in some with ف and ض, the latter unpointed, and<br>\
so in [a copy of] the A, (TA,) (tropical:)  They retired to<br>\
a distance from us, they being around us, and we<br>\
not being distant from them, had they desired to<br>\
come to us. (K, TA.) And حُطْنِى القَصَا (tropical:)  Retire<br>\
thou to a distance from me; (Ibn-Wellád, and<br>\
K in art. قصو;) as also القَصَآءَ. (Ibn-Wellád, and<br>\
TA in that art.) And لَأَحُوطَنَّكَ القَصَا وَلَأَغْزُوَنَّكَ<br>\
بِالعَصَا, in each case with the short &amp; ا, meaning<br>\
I will assuredly leave thee, and not go near thee;<br>\
[and I will assuredly go against thee to fight thee<br>\
with the staff.] (Ks, TA in art. قصو.) حُطْ حُطْ<br>\
means Take thou care of the tie of kindred, and<br>\
preserve it. (IAar, K. *) It also signifies Deck<br>\
thou the boys (الصِّبْيَة [in the CK الصَّبِيَّة the girl])<br>\
with the حَوْط [for preservation from the evil eye].<br>\
(IAar, K.) And حُوطُوا غُلَامَكُمْ Deck ye your boy<br>\
with the حَوْط. (AA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  حَاطَ الحِمَارُ عَانَتَهُ, (S, *<br>\
Msb, K,) nor, as above, (S, Msb,) inf. n. حَوْطٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) The [wild] he-ass collected, or drew together, (S, * Msb, K, *) and guarded, or took care<br>\
of, (TA,) his عَانَة [app. meaning his herd of wild<br>\
asses: or the phrase may mean the he-ass drew<br>\
towards himself, or compressed, and guarded, his<br>\
she-ass: Freytag here renders عانة by “ pubem; ”<br>\
and Golius, by “ veretrum ”]. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
حوّط حَوْلَهُ, inf. n. تَحْوِيطٌ, He surrounded it<br>\
by some such thing as earth, so as to make this to<br>\
encompass it. (Msb.) And حوّط كَرْمَهُ, inf. n.<br>\
as above, He built a حَائِط [or wall] around his<br>\
vine. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, أَنَا أُحَوِّطُ ذٰلِكَ الأَمْرُ<br>\
(tropical:)  I have within my compass, or power, and care,<br>\
that thing, or affair; [like أُحَوِّضُ, q. v.;] syn.<br>\
أَدُورُ. (S, TA.) [Hence also, حوّط عَلَيْهِ, in the<br>\
present day, is used to signify (assumed tropical:)  He monopolized<br>\
it. See also 4.] ―<br>\
-b3-  حوّط حَائِطًا, (K,) inf. n. as<br>\
above, (TA,) He made a حائط [meaning either<br>\
a walled garden or a wall; app. a wall of enclosure]; (K, TA;) as also ↓ احاطهُ. (IDrd, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  See also 1.<br>\
3<br>\
حاوط فُلَانًا (tropical:)  He endeavoured to induce such<br>\
a one to turn, or incline; or endeavoured to turn<br>\
him by deceit, or guile; (دَاوَرَهُ;) in a matter that<br>\
he desired of him, and which he refused him:<br>\
(K:) as though each of them were guarding, or<br>\
taking care of, (يَحُوطُ,) the other. (K: and so in<br>\
the A, in illustration of what next follows.)<br>\
حَاوِطْهُ فَإِنَّهُ يَلِينُ لَكَ (tropical:)  Endeavour thou to induce<br>\
him to turn, or incline; or endeavour thou to turn<br>\
him by deceit, or guile; [for he will relent to thee;]<br>\
syn. دَاوِرْهُ. (A, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
احاط بِهِ and<br>\
بِهِ ↓ حَاطَ signify the same [i. e.<br>\
It, or he, surrounded, encompassed, environed,<br>\
enclosed, or hemmed in, it, or him]. (TA.) You<br>\
say, احاط القَوْمُ بِالبَلَدِ, inf. n. إِحَاطَةٌ; and ↓ حَاطُوا<br>\
بِهِ; The people surrounded, encompassed, environed, encircled, or beset, the sides of the town.<br>\
(Msb.) And احاطت الخَيْلُ بِفُلَانٍ, (S, TA,) and<br>\
به ↓ حَاطَتْ, (TA,) and به ↓ احتاطت, (S,) The<br>\
horses, or horsemen, surrounded, encompassed,<br>\
environed, encircled, or beset, such a one. (S,<br>\
TA.) [And احاطوا بِهِ مِنْ جَانِبَيْهِ, meaning They<br>\
surrounded him on all his sides; lit. on his two<br>\
sides: see جَنْبٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in the Kur<br>\
[xvii. 62], إِنَّ رَبَّكَ أَحَاطَ بِالنَّاسِ (assumed tropical:)  Verily thy Lord<br>\
hath men in his grasp, or power: (Bd, TA:) or<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  hath destroyed them; meaning Kureysh. (Bd.)<br>\
You say also, أُحِيطَ بِفُلَانٍ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one<br>\
was destroyed: or (assumed tropical:)  his destruction drew near.<br>\
(TA.) And hence the saying in the Kur [xviii. 40],<br>\
وَأُحِيطَ بِثَمَرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  And its fruit became smitten by that<br>\
which destroyed and spoiled it: (TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  his<br>\
possessions became destroyed: from أَحَاطَ بِهِ العَدُوُّ<br>\
[the enemy surrounded him]. (Bd.) [Hence<br>\
also, in the same, ii. 75,] وَأَحَاطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيْئَتُهُ (assumed tropical:)  And<br>\
over whom his sin hath gained the mastery, affecting all the circumstances of his case, so that<br>\
he hath become as though he were entirely encompassed thereby: (Bd:) or (assumed tropical:)  who hath died in the<br>\
belief of a plurality of Gods. (TA.) You also<br>\
say, احاط بِهِ الأَمْرُ (assumed tropical:)  The thing beset him on every<br>\
side, so that he had no place of escape from it.<br>\
(TA.) And احاط عَلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  He took it entirely to<br>\
himself, debarring others from it: [see also 2.]<br>\
(TA in art شرب.) ―<br>\
-b3-  احاط بِهِ, (K,) or احاط بِهِ عِلْمًا,<br>\
(S, Msb, TA,) and احاط بِهِ عِلْمُهُ, (S, TA,) (tropical:)  [He<br>\
comprehended it, or knew it altogether, in all its<br>\
modes or circumstances;] he knew it extrinsically<br>\
and intrinsically; (Msb;) or he attained the utmost particular thereof, and had a comprehensive<br>\
and complete knowledge thereof: or he attained<br>\
everything [relating to it], and the utmost knowledge thereof. (K, accord. to different copies. [In<br>\
the CK, اَحْصٰى عِلْمُهُ is put, erroneously, for<br>\
احصى عِلْمَهُ.]) It is said in the Kur [xxvii. 22],<br>\
أَحَطْتُ بِمَا لَمْ تُحِطْ بِهِ (tropical:)  I have known in all its<br>\
circumstances, or modes, that which thou hast not<br>\
so known. (TA.) And you say also, عَلِمَهُ عِلْمَ<br>\
إِحَاطَةٍ (tropical:)  He knew it in all its circumstances, or<br>\
modes; nothing of them escaping him. (TA.)<br>\

تَحَوَّطَ see 1, in two places.<br>\
8<br>\
احتاط: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  He took the course<br>\
prescribed by prudence, precaution, or good judgment; he used precaution; he took the sure<br>\
course; (S, * K, * TA;) لِنَفْسِهِ for himself; (S,<br>\
TA;) [and مِنَ الشَّىْءِ against the thing:] he sought<br>\
the most successful means, and took the surest<br>\
method; لِلشَّىْءِ for [the accomplishment, or attainment, of] the thing. (Msb.) The subst. [denoting the abstract signification of the inf. n.,<br>\
اِحْتِيَاطٌ,] is حيطة, (Msb,) i. e. ↓ حَيْطَةٌ and ↓ حِيطَةٌ,<br>\
(K, TA,) which latter is originally حِوْطَةٌ, (TA,)<br>\
[and is also an inf. n. of 1,] and ↓ حَوْطَةٌ. (K,<br>\
TA.) Some hold احتياط to belong to art. حيط.<br>\
(Msb.) You say also فِى الأُمُورِ ↓ استحاط [meaning in like manner (assumed tropical:)  He took the course prescribed by prudence, &amp;c., in affairs, or in the<br>\
affairs: as is shown below: see مُحْتَاطٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَحْوَطَ see 8.<br>\
حَوْطٌ A twisted string of two colours, black and<br>\
red, (IAar, K,) called بَرِيم, (IAar,) upon which<br>\
are beads and a crescent of silver, which a woman<br>\
binds upon her waist, [and which is bound upon<br>\
a boy, (see 1,)] in order that the evil eye may not<br>\
smite her [or him]: (IAar, K:) and also the<br>\
crescent above mentioned; as well as the string<br>\
with it. (TA.) [See also تَحْوِيطَةٌ.]<br>\
حَوْطَةٌ: see 8.<br>\
حَيْطَةٌ: see 8.<br>\
حِيطَةٌ: see 8.<br>\
حُوَاطٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
حُوَاطَةٌ An enclosure (حَظِيرَة) made for wheat:<br>\
(S, K:) or it signifies a thing which one soon<br>\
quits, or relinquishes, or from which one soon abstains; and so ↓ حُوَاطٌ, as occurring [accord. to<br>\
one relation] in a verse cited voce عُرْسٌ. (L.)<br>\
حَيِّطٌ, [originally either حَوِيطٌ or حَيْوِطٌ,] like سَيِّدٌ,<br>\
A man who guards, protects, or defends, (يَحُوطُ,)<br>\
his family and his brethren. (TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
حَوَّاطٌ A monopolizer: so in the present day.]<br>\
حَوَّاطُ أَمْرٍ (tropical:)  The undertakers, superintendents,<br>\
or managers, of an affair. (K, TA.) [See a<br>\
verse cited voce عُرْسٌ.]<br>\
حَائِطٌ A wall. (Msb, * K, TA:) or a wall of<br>\
enclosure: (Msb, * TA:) or one that surrounds<br>\
a garden: (Mgh:) [often applied to a fence of<br>\
wood, or sticks, or of reeds, or canes:] so called<br>\
because it surrounds what is within it; (TA;)<br>\
but it is a subst., like سَقْفٌ and رُكْنٌ, though<br>\
implying the meaning of surrounding: (IJ, TA:)<br>\
or it is an act. part. n., from حَاطَ: (Msb:) pl.<br>\
حِيطَانٌ, (S, Msb, K,) in which the و is changed<br>\
into ى because of the kesreh before it, (S,) but<br>\
by rule it should be حُوطَانٌ; (Sb, K;) and حِيَاطٌ.<br>\
(IAar, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (Mgh,) A garden,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K,) in general: or a garden of palmtrees, surrounded by a wall: (TA:) pl. حَوَائِطُ.<br>\
(Msb, TA.)<br>\
اِفْعَلِ الأَحْوَطَ (assumed tropical:)  Do thou that which is most<br>\
comprehensive in relation to the principles of the<br>\
ordinances [applying to the case], (مَا هُوَ أَجْمَعُ<br>\
لِأُصُولِ الأَحْكَامِ,) and furthest from the sophistications of interpretations not according to the<br>\
obvious meanings. (Msb.) And هٰذَا أَحْوَطُ (assumed tropical:)  This<br>\
is more, or most, conducive to put [one] in a<br>\
position of اِحْتِيَاط [or taking the course prescribed<br>\
by prudence, precaution, or good judgment; &amp;c.:<br>\
see 8]. (Mgh.) The word أَحْوَطُ is from the<br>\
phrase حَاطَ الحِمَارُ عَانَتَهُ; not from الاِحْتِيَاطُ;<br>\
because the افعل of excess is not formed from a<br>\
verb of five letters: (Msb:) or it is anomalous,<br>\
like أَخْصَرُ from الاِخْتِصَارُ. (Mgh.) [It may be<br>\
rendered More, or most, prudent: or more, or<br>\
most, sure.]<br>\
تَحُوطُ and التَّحُوطُ &amp;c.: see what next follows.<br>\
تُحِيطُ and ↓ تَحُوطُ (ISk, TS, K) and تَحِيطُ and<br>\
تِحِيطُ and ↓ يَحِيطُ (TS, K) and ↓ التَّحُوطُ and<br>\
التَّحِيطُ (L, K) [and ↓ تَحَوُّط and ↓ تحوَّط (mentioned, with the third and fourth, in Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Arab. Prov., ii. 803, as on the authority of Fr,)]<br>\
(tropical:)  The year of dearth, scarcity, or straitness, that<br>\
destroys the beasts, (Fr, K, * TA,) or men: (A,<br>\
TA:) تَحُوطُ being from حَاطَ بِهِ in the sense of<br>\
أَحَاطَ; or it is used as a term of good omen;<br>\
accord. to the A. (TA.) You say, وَقَعُوا فِى<br>\
تُحِيطَ, &amp;c., [the last word being a noun imperfectly decl., (tropical:)  They fell into the affliction of a<br>\
year of dearth, &amp;c.] (ISk, TA.)<br>\
تَحْويِطَةٌ A thing that is hung upon a boy to<br>\
repel the evil eye: of the dial. of El-Yemen.<br>\
(TA.) [See also حَوْطٌ.]<br>\
مَحَاطٌ A place behind the camels or other beasts<br>\
and the people [to whom they belong], surrounding and protecting them: (K:) some say that<br>\
أَرْضٌ مَحَاطٌ signifies land surrounded by a wall:<br>\
if not so surrounded, it is termed ضَاحِيَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
فُلَانٌ مُحَاطٌ بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is slain; is destroyed. (TA.)<br>\
مُحِيطٌ [act. part. n. of 4; Surrounding, encompassing, or enclosing: &amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in<br>\
the Kur [lxxxv. 20], وَاللّٰهُ مِنْ وَرَائِهِمْ مُحيِطٌ (assumed tropical:)  And<br>\
God, behind them, includeth them altogether<br>\
within his power; not one shall escape Him.<br>\
(TA.) And again, [xi. 85,] عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ مُحِيطٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The punishment of a day which shall beset on<br>\
every side so that there shall be no place of escape<br>\
from it: (TA:) or of a destructive day: meaning the day of resurrection: or the punishment<br>\
[of a day] of extermination: the epithet, which<br>\
is that of the punishment, being applied to the<br>\
day because it includes it. (Bd.) And again,<br>\
[ii. 18,] وَاللّٰهُ مُحِيطٌ بِالكَافِرِينَ, explained by Mujá-<br>\
hid as signifying (assumed tropical:)  And God will collect together<br>\
the unbelievers on the day of resurrection. (TA.)<br>\
كَرْمٌ مُحوَّطٌ A vine having a wall built around<br>\
it. (S.)<br>\
هُوَ مُحْتَاطٌ فِى أَمْرِهِ and فِيهِ ↓ مُسْتَحِيطٌ [He is<br>\
taking the course prescribed by prudence, precaution, or good judgment; or using precaution;<br>\
or taking the sure course; or seeking the most<br>\
successful means, and taking the surest method;<br>\
in his affair: see 8]. (TA.)<br>\
