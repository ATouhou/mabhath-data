ح<br>\
The sixth letter of the alphabet: called حَآءٌ [and<br>\
حَا (respecting which latter see the letter ب).<br>\
It is one of the letters termed مَهْمُوسَة, or nonvocal, i. e. pronounced with the breath only,<br>\
without the voice; and of those termed حَلْقِيَّة<br>\
i. e. faucial, or guttural, for] the place of its<br>\
utterance is in the fauces; and were it not for<br>\
a hoarse aspiration with which it is pronounced,<br>\
it would resemble ع: next after it [with respect<br>\
to the place of utterance] is ه: [ع having the<br>\
lowest place of utterance; then ح; and then ه:]<br>\
and ح and ه are never consociated in any uncompounded word of the which the letters are all<br>\
radicals, because of the mutual nearness of their<br>\
places of utterance: they occur together in حَيَّهَلْ;<br>\
but this is only a compound word in the classical<br>\
language; and as the name of a certain kind of<br>\
tree it is a post-classical word. (Kh, L.)<br>\
-A2-  [It<br>\
is often put for حِينَئِذٍ.<br>\
-A3-  As a numeral, it denotes<br>\
Eight.]<br>\
