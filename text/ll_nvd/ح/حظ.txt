inf. n. حَظٌّ, (K,) He was, or became, fortunate,<br>\
or possessed of good fortune, (S, K,) فِى الأَمْرِ in<br>\
the affair; (K;) as also ↓ احظّ: (K, TA:) or<br>\
↓ the latter signifies he was, or became, rich,<br>\
wealthy, or opulent; or in a state of, or possessed<br>\
of, competence, or sufficiency; in no need; without wants; or with few wants. (O, TS.) Lth<br>\
says, I have not heard any verb from حَظٌّ: but it<br>\
has a verb, transmitted from the Arabs, which<br>\
Lth did not know, and had not heard: and<br>\
AHeyth says, in writing to Ibn-Buzurj, هُمْ<br>\
يُحَظُّونَ بِهِمْ, and يُجَدُّونَ بهم, (Az, TA,) meaning They become possessed of good fortune, and<br>\
riches, or competence, or sufficiency. (L in art.<br>\
جد.)<br>\

أَحْظَ3َ see 1, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  أَحْظَيْتُهُ عَلَيْهِ [I preferred him above him] may be from the same<br>\
root as the other words of this art.; the second ظ<br>\
being changed into ى; [like as أَمْلَيْتُ is, accord.<br>\
to some, formed from أَمْلَلْتُ;] or it may be from<br>\
حُظْوَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
حَظٌّ Fortune; or particularly good fortune;<br>\
syn. جَدٌّ (S, Nh, Msb, K) and بَخْتٌ: (Nh:) and<br>\
a share, portion, or lot: (S, Msb, K:) or particularly a share, portion, or lot, of something<br>\
good or excellent: (Lth, K:) some of the people<br>\
of Hims say حَنْزٌ; but when they form a pl., they<br>\
return to the original, saying حُظُوظٌ: and the ن<br>\
is regarded by them as a nasal sound, not as a<br>\
radical letter: and in like manner they do in the<br>\
case of every word having a doubled letter, such<br>\
as رُزٌّ and أُتْرُجٌّ, saying رٌنْزٌ and أُتْرُنْجٌ: (Lth, L:)<br>\
the pl. (of pauc., S) is أَحُظٌّ (S, K) and (of mult.,<br>\
S) حُظُوظٌ (AZ, S, Msb, K) and حُظُوظَةٌ (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, K) and حِظَاظٌ (IJ, K) and حُظٌّ (AZ, K)<br>\
and ↓ أَحَاظٍ, (S, L, K, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
أَحَاظٌ,]) irregularly, as though it were pl. of أَحْظٍ,<br>\
(S, L,) or it is regularly formed from أَحْظٍ, which<br>\
latter is [irregular, being] originally أَحْظُظٌ, [which<br>\
is the original form of the pl. of pauc. mentioned<br>\
above,] (IB,) and another pl. is ↓ حِظَآءٌ, (L, [and<br>\
so in the TA as from the K, but in several copies<br>\
of the K ↓ حِظَّآءٌ, which is of one of the forms of<br>\
quasi-pl. ns.,]) also irregular, being formed [from<br>\
حِظَاظٌ] by a change of the second ظ [into ى and<br>\
then into ء]. (L.)<br>\
-A2-  See also حَظِيظٌ.<br>\
حِظَآءٌ and حِظَّآءٌ: see حَظٌّ.<br>\
حَظِّىٌّ, or حَظِىٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\
حَظِيظٌ and ↓ حَظٌّ (S, K) and ↓ حَظِّىٌّ, as a relative n., accord. to [most of] the copies of the<br>\
K, or as a defective word, [i. e. ↓ حَظِىٌّ, with a<br>\
single ظ, as we find it in the CK,] accord. to Az,<br>\
who says that it is originally حَظٌّ, (TA,) and<br>\
↓ مَحْظُوظٌ, (AA, S, Msb, K,) Fortunate; or possessed of good fortune; (S, Msb, K;) possessing<br>\
a good share (حَظٌّ)  of the means of subsistence:<br>\
(TA:) or the first, accord. to Fr, possessing competence, or sufficiency; or rich, or wealthy, or<br>\
opulent: (TA:) the pl. [accord. to analogy of<br>\
حَظِيظٌ] is أَحِظَّآءُ. (So in the L: [in the TA<br>\
written أَحْظَآء, which I think a mistake, though<br>\
it seems to be there implied that it is pl. of حَظٌّ,<br>\
and if so, we must suppose it to be originally<br>\
أَحْظَاظٌ, like as حِظَآءٌ, a pl. of the subst. حَظٌّ, if<br>\
correct, is originally حِظَاظٌ.])<br>\
فُلَانٌ أَحَظُّ مِنْ فُلَانٍ Such a one is more fortunate than such a one. (S, * Msb, * TA.)<br>\
أَحَاظٍ said to be an irreg. pl. of حَظٌّ, q. v.<br>\
مَحْظُوظٌ: see حَظِيظٌ.<br>\
