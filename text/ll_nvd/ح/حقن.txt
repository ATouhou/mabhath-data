حَقَنَهُ, aor.<br>\
حَقُنَ and<br>\
حَقِنَ, (K,) inf. n. حَقْنٌ, (TA,)<br>\
i. q. حَبَسَهُ [as meaning He confined it; kept it<br>\
in; prevented it from escape; retained, restrained, or withheld, it]; (K;) as also ↓ احتقنهُ,<br>\
(as in some copies of the K,) or ↓ احقنهُ; (as in<br>\
other copies and in the TA;) but see, in what<br>\
follows, what is said of this last in the S. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  حَقَنَ اللَّبَنَ (S, Mgh, K) فِى السِّقَآءِ, (K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
حَقُنَ, (S,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) He collected<br>\
the milk in the skin, (S, Mgh,) and poured fresh<br>\
milk upon that which was curdled, or thick, or<br>\
upon that which was churned: (S:) or he poured<br>\
the milk into the skin, [and kept it therein] that<br>\
its butter might come forth. (K.) And حَقَنَ<br>\
المَآءَ فِى السِّقَآءِ, aor.<br>\
حَقُنَ, inf. n. as above, He collected<br>\
the water in the skin. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  حَقَنَ البَوْلَ,<br>\
(Ks, S, M,) or بَوْلَهُ, (Mgh, Msb,) He kept in,<br>\
or retained, (M, Mgh, Msb,) and collected, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) the urine, (M,) or his urine: (Mgh, Msb:)<br>\
one should not say ↓ احقنهُ; (Ks, S, M;) nor<br>\
should one say [of the urine] حَقَنَنِى هُوَ. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  حَقَنَ دَمَهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and حَقَنَ لَهُ دَمَهُ,<br>\
(TA from a trad.,) (tropical:)  He prevented or forbade, the<br>\
shedding of his blood, (S, Mgh, TA,) and the slaying him; (TA;) [he spared his blood, or forbore to<br>\
shed it;] i. e., (Mgh,) he saved him (Mgh, K) from<br>\
slaughter (K) when it had become lawful to slay<br>\
him; from حَقَنَ اللَّبَنَ; (Mgh;) contr. of هَدَرَهُ;<br>\
as though he collected his blood in him, and did<br>\
not pour it forth. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  حَقَنَ مَآءَ وَجْهِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
preserved [the lustre of his face; meaning his<br>\
honour, or reputation]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  حَقَنَ المَرِيضَ<br>\
(S, * Mgh, Msb, K *) He administered to the<br>\
sick person what is termed حُقْنَة, i. e. [a clyster,]<br>\
a medicine put into a مِحْقَنَة; (Mgh;) he conveyed medicine into the inside of the sick person<br>\
by his anus (مِنْ مَخْرَجِهِ) with the مِحْقَنَة. (Msb.)<br>\
See also 8.<br>\
4<br>\
احقن He collected different sorts of milk<br>\
[in a skin, old and fresh,] to become good. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, in two places.<br>\
5<br>\
تَحَقَّنَتِ الإِبِلُ The camels became full in<br>\
their insides. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
احتقن as a trans. v.: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  Also It<br>\
(blood) collected in the inside in consequence of a<br>\
spear-wound, or stab, or the like, penetrating<br>\
thereinto. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He (a man) administered to himself, or had administered to him,<br>\
a حُقْنَة [or clyster]: (S, * Mgh, Msb:) or he (a<br>\
sick man) made use of the حُقْنَة in consequence of<br>\
suppression of his urine. (K.) The saying اِحْتَقَنَ<br>\
الصَّبِىُّ بِلَبَنِ أُمِّهِ [meaning The child had its<br>\
mother&#39;s milk administered to it as a clyster] is farfetched: and اُحْتُقِنَ is not allowable: the right<br>\
expression is ↓ حُقِنَ, or عُولِجَ بِالحُقْنَةِ. (Mgh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And اِحْتَقَنَتِ الرَّوْضَةُ The روضة [i. e. meadow,<br>\
or garden,] had its sides elevated عَلَى سَائِرِهَا<br>\
[above the rest of it]: so says AHn: in the K,<br>\
على سَرَارِهَا [above the depressed, or the best, or<br>\
most fruitful, part of it: in the CK, سِرارِها].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
حَقِنٌ: see حَاقِنٌ.<br>\
حَقْنَةٌ A pain in the belly: pl. أَحْقَانٌ. (IAar, K.)<br>\
حُقْنَةٌ The administration of a medicine to a<br>\
sick person by his anus; (TA;) [i. e. the administration of a clyster;] the conveyance of a<br>\
medicine to the inside of a sick person by his<br>\
anus with the مِحْقَنَة. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,<br>\
(Msb,) [A clyster;] a medicine so administered<br>\
to a sick person: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) pl. حُقَنٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, by extension of the meaning,<br>\
The tube of a مِحْقَنَة. (Mgh.)<br>\
حَقِينٌ Confined, kept in, prevented from escape,<br>\
retained, restrained, or withheld; as also ↓ مَحْقُونٌ.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, as a subst., (S,) Milk collected in<br>\
a skin, (S, IF, Msb,) when fresh milk has been<br>\
poured upon that which has become curdled, or<br>\
thick, or upon that which has been churned.<br>\
(S, TA.) Hence the prov., أَبَى الحَقِينُ العِذْرَةَ;<br>\
i. e. العُذْرَ; [The milk collected in the skin, &amp;c.,<br>\
has disallowed the excuse;] (A &#39;Obeyd, S, TA;)<br>\
applied to him who excuses himself when having<br>\
no [real] excuse: (TA:) originally said by a<br>\
man who asked some people to give him milk<br>\
to drink, upon their excusing themselves while<br>\
they had milk which they had collected in a<br>\
skin; meaning, this حقبن belies you. (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
حَاقِنٌ A man keeping in, or retaining, and<br>\
collecting, his urine; from حَقِينٌ meaning “ milk<br>\
collected in a skin: ” (IF, Msb:) [suffering from<br>\
retention of the urine:] having urine that distresses [by its quantity]: (S, TA:) having much<br>\
urine retained and collected: (Mgh:) and ↓ حَقِنٌ<br>\
signifies the same. (TA.) Hence the saying,<br>\
(Mgh, TA,) in a trad., (TA,) لَا رَأْىَ لِحَاقِنٍ وَلَا<br>\
حَاقِبٍ وَلَا حَازِقٍ (S, * Mgh, TA *) No counsel, or<br>\
advice, is possible to one who has much urine<br>\
retained and collected, nor to one suffering suppression of the feces, nor to one who is pinched<br>\
by a tight boot. (Mgh, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Collecting<br>\
grease, or melted grease, in a skin.] You say,<br>\
أَنَا مِنْهُ كَحَاقِنِ الإِهَالَةِ (assumed tropical:)  I am a person skilled<br>\
in it; because such a one does not collect the<br>\
اهالة in a skin until he knows that it has cooled,<br>\
lest the skin should be burnt. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  A moon<br>\
a little after or before the change (هِلَال) having<br>\
its two extremities elevated, and its back decumbent. (K.) Hence the saying, هِلَالٌ وَاقِفٌ خَيْرٌ<br>\
مِنْ هِلَالٍ حَاقِنٍ (tropical:)  [A هلال erect (here meaning<br>\
nearly erect) is better, or more auspicious, than<br>\
a هلال decumbent]. (A, TA.) [See also أَذْفَقُ.]<br>\
الحَاقِنَةُ The stomach; (K;) an epithet in which<br>\
the quality of a subst. is predominant; because<br>\
it retains, or collects, the food: (TA:) and the<br>\
pit between each collar-bone and what is termed<br>\
حَبْلُ العَاتِقِ [explained in art. حبل, q. v.]; (AA,<br>\
S, K; *) the two together being termed [the]<br>\
حَاقِنَتَانِ: (AA, S:) the pit of each collar-bone:<br>\
(T, TA:) the part between the collar-bone and<br>\
the neck: (TA:) or the lower part of the belly:<br>\
(S, K:) pl. الحَوَاقِنُ. (T, TA.) [See also الذَّاقِنَةُ.]<br>\
Hence, (K,) it is said in a prov., لَأُلْحِقَنَّ حَوَاقِنَكَ<br>\
بِذَوَاقِنِكِ, (S, K,) i. e. [I will assuredly conjoin] the<br>\
lower part of thy belly with the upper part<br>\
thereof: or the part of thy belly that retains, or<br>\
collects, the food, with the lower part of thy belly,<br>\
and with thy knees. (TA.) The ذَاقِنَة is [also<br>\
said to be] the extremity of the حُلْقُوم [or windpipe]: and hence the saying attributed to &#39;Áïsheh,<br>\
that the Prophet died [with his head] between<br>\
her حَاقِنَة and her ذَاقِنَة. (S.)<br>\
مِحْقَنٌ A skin in which milk is collected;<br>\
fresh milk being poured into it upon that which<br>\
is curdled, or thick, or upon that which has been<br>\
churned: (S:) or a skin into which milk is<br>\
poured, [and in which it is kept,] that its butter<br>\
may come forth. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A funnel with<br>\
which the milk is poured into the skin: (Az, K: *)<br>\
or a funnel which is put into the mouth of a<br>\
skin, into which one then pours wine, and water.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
مَحْقَنَةٌ app. sing. of مَحَاقِنُ as used in the<br>\
following saying; like as مَحْقَلَةٌ is sing of مَحَاقِلُ.]<br>\
بَارَكَ اللّٰهُ فِى مَحَاقِلِكُمْ وَمَحاقِنِكُمْ May God bless<br>\
your seed-produce and your progeny. (TA.)<br>\
مِحْقَنَةٌ The thing with which a حُقْنَة [or clyster]<br>\
is administered; (Mgh, Msb;) being a leathern<br>\
pouch, furnished with a tube. (Mgh.)<br>\
مِحْقَانٌ One who retains his urine, and, when<br>\
he discharges it, discharges much: (S, K:) applied<br>\
by ISd peculiarly to a camel. (TA.)<br>\
مَحْقُونٌ: see حَقِينٌ.<br>\
