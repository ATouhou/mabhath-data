[app. مُحْتَوًى] and ↓ محوى [app. مَحْوًى] signify a<br>\
place in which the tents (بيوت) of a tribe are collected together: (Lth, TA:) the last is of the dial.<br>\
of El-Yemen, where it is applied to a few small<br>\
tents collected together in a tract, or region, of<br>\
fruitful, or productive, land: (TA:) and its pl.<br>\
is محاوى [or, more probably, مَحَاوٍ; with the<br>\

and البَطْنِ ↓ حَاوِيَآءُ all signify the same: (S:)<br>\
the pl. is حَوَايَا; (K;) or this is the pl. of حَوِيَّةٌ,<br>\
signifying the أَمْعَآء [or intestines into which the<br>\
food passes from the stomach]; and the pl. of<br>\
حَاوِيَةٌ and حَاوِيَآءُ is [said to be] حَوَاوٍ; (S;) but<br>\
IB says that this latter pl. is not held to be allowable by Sb, and that حَوَايَا is the pl. of all the<br>\
three sings., [originally] of the measure فَعَائِلُ as<br>\
pl. of the first, and فَوَاعِلُ as pl. of the second and<br>\
third [though in these two cases it should be by<br>\
rule حَوَآءٍ]: AHeyth says that حَوَايَا as pl. of<br>\
حَاوِيَةٌ is like زَوَايَا as pl. of زَاوِيَةٌ: and ISk mentions الحَاوِيَاتُ as pl. of الحَاوِيَةُ and الحَاوِيَآءُ, [in<br>\
the latter case like قَاصِعَاتٌ as pl. of قَاصِعَآءُ,] and<br>\

the rain fills, and in which it remains a long time<br>\
because the soil at the bottom thereof is cohesive<br>\
and hard, retaining the water: the Arabs call<br>\
them [also] أَمْعَآء, likening them to the حَوَايَا of<br>\
the belly: accord. to AA, the pl. signifies i. q.<br>\
مَسَاطِحُ [pl. of مِسْطَحٌ], made by collecting earth<br>\
and stones upon smooth and hard rock, to confine<br>\
thereby water: accord. to IB, on the authority<br>\
of IKh, wells that are dug in the district of Kelb,<br>\
in hard ground, whereby is confined the water of<br>\
the torrents, which they drink throughout the<br>\
year: accord. to Nasr, a certain construction<br>\
with masses of rock in the form of a pool, on the<br>\
way to Et-Teghlibeeyeh, near Ood: accord. to<br>\
ISd, the sing. signifies a smooth and hard rock<br>\
which is surrounded with stones and earth, in<br>\
which water collects. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A [garment<br>\
of the kind called] كِسَآء, stuffed [with ثُمَام or<br>\
the like], which is wound round the hump of the<br>\

is only for camels, and the latter is sometimes for<br>\
other animals: pl. حَوَايَا: (S:) a subst. from 2<br>\
in the last of the senses assigned to it above:<br>\
(IAth:) [the same is app. meant by what here<br>\
follows:] a certain thing that is prepared for a<br>\
woman to ride upon. (TA. [But it was also<br>\
used by men.]) &#39;Omeyr Ibn-Wahb El-Jumahee<br>\
said, on the day of Bedr, when he computed the<br>\
number of the companions of the Prophet, رَأَيْتُ<br>\
الحَوَايَا عَلَيْهَا المَنَايَا [meaning I saw the حوايا with<br>\
the men of courage upon them]: (S:) [for]<br>\
مَنِيَّةٌ [sing. of منايا] means (assumed tropical:)  “ a man of courage<br>\
upon his saddle. ” (TA.)<br>\
حُوَيَّةٌ [a dim. of حَيَّةٌ]: see what next follows.<br>\
رَجُلٌ حَوَّآءٌ A man who collects serpents (حَيَّات);<br>\
and so ↓ حَاوٍ: [which latter, vulgarly pronounced<br>\
حَاوِى, is also now applied to a serpent-charmer;<br>\
and a juggler who performs various tricks with<br>\
serpents &amp;c.:] (K in art. حى:) or the latter,<br>\
(S in that art.,) or both, (T in that art.,) an<br>\
owner of serpents; (T, S;) and so حَاىٍ: (T:)<br>\
the pl. of حَاوٍ is حُوَاةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
↓ الحَوَّآءُ الحُوَيَّةُ (assumed tropical:)  The constellations Serpentarius<br>\
and Serpens. (Kzw.)<br>\
حَاوٍ: see what next precedes.<br>\
حَاوِيَةٌ: see حَوِيَّةٌ, in three places.<br>\
حَاوِيَآءُ: see حَوِيَّةٌ, in two places.<br>\
حَاوِىٌّ: see حَائِىٌّ, in art. حوأ.<br>\
حَيَّةٌ [meaning A serpent] is said by some to be<br>\
from تَحَوَّى, because what is so termed gathers<br>\
itself together, and winds, or coils, itself; (ISd, *<br>\
K, * TA;) and to be originally حَوْيَةٌ; (TA in art.<br>\
حى;) and their opinion is strengthened by the<br>\
forms and meaning of the words حَوَّآءٌ and حَاوٍ<br>\
(TA) [and by the form and meaning of the word<br>\
مَحْوَاةٌ]: or the حيّة is so called because of the<br>\
length of its life (لِطُولِ حَيَاتِهَا). (K. [See the<br>\
next art.])<br>\
أَحْوَى: see art. حو.<br>\
أَحْوِىٌّ: see art. حو.<br>\
محوى [app. مَحْوًى]: see حِوَآءٌ.<br>\
أَرْضٌ مَحْوَاةٌ A land abounding with حَيَّات [or<br>\
serpents]: (TA:) or containing serpents; as also<br>\

which latter is the more common, (Fr, S,) [like<br>\
مَلَّ, originally مَلِلَ,] dual حَيِيَا, and حَيَّا, (Fr,)<br>\
pl. حَيُوا, (Fr, S,) like خَشُوا, (S,) and حَيُّوا, (Fr,<br>\
S,) as some say, (S,) aor. يَحْيَا, (S, Msb, K,) and<br>\
يَحَىُّ, (Fr, K,) [like يَمَلُّ, originally يَمْلَلُ,] occurring in poetry, but improper, and disallowed by<br>\
the Basrees, (Fr,) inf. n. حَيَاةٌ [q. v. infrà], (IB,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) or حَيَآءٌ, (K,) and حِىٌّ and حَيَوَانٌ,<br>\
(IB,) which last has an intensive signification,<br>\
like its contr. مَوَتَانٌ, (Msb,) He, or it, lived;<br>\
or was, or became, in the state termed حَيَاةٌ, explained below. (S, K.) [The inf. n. حَيَوَانٌ (q. v.<br>\
infrà) suggests the supposition that حَيِىَ may be<br>\
originally حَيِوَ; but I find no authority for this<br>\
supposition; and if it be the case, this verb presents the only instance of a root of which the<br>\
medial radical letter is ى and the final و.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
حَيُوا, said of a people, or company of men, (assumed tropical:)  They<br>\
were, or became, in good condition: (AA, S:) or<br>\
they were, or became, fat, by having the means of<br>\
subsistence, بَعْدَ هُزَالٍ [after leanness]. (AZ. [See<br>\
also 4.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  You say also, حَيَّتِ النَّارُ, inf. n. حَيَاةٌ<br>\
and حَيَآءٌ, (assumed tropical:)  [The fire was, or became, alive, or<br>\
burning,] like as you say, مَاتَت. (AHn.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
حَيِىَ الطَّرِيقُ (assumed tropical:)  The road, or way, was, or became,<br>\
apparent, or distinct. (K.) One says, إِذَا حَيِىَ<br>\
لَكَ الطَّرِيقُ فَخُذْ يَمْنَةً (assumed tropical:)  [When the road, or way,<br>\
becomes apparent, or distinct, to thee, take to the<br>\
right]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  حَيِىَ and حَيِىَ مِنْهُ, aor. يَحْيَا,<br>\
inf. n. حَيَآءٌ: see 10, in two places.<br>\

primary sense, i. q. ↓ احياهُ. (Mgh.) You say,<br>\
حَيَّاكَ اللّٰهُ, (S, K,) meaning May God preserve<br>\
thee alive; prolong thy life; or make thee to continue in life; syn. أَبْقَاكَ; (Fr, Selemeh Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Ásim, K;) as also ↓ احياك; (Selemeh Ibn-&#39;Ásim,<br>\
TA;) or عَمَّرَكَ: (Aboo-&#39;Othmán El-Mázinee,<br>\
Mgh, TA:) or may God save thee; or make thee<br>\
to be free from evil, or harm, or the like: (Fr,<br>\
TA:) or may God make thee to have dominion:<br>\
(Fr, S, K:) or may God honour thee, and benefit<br>\
thee. (Ham. p. 489.) And حَيَّاكَ اللّٰهُ وَبَيَّاكَ [explained in art. بى]. (TA.) And حَيَّا اللّٰهُ وَجْهَكَ<br>\
[May God preserve thy face: see مُحَيًّا]. (Ham<br>\
p. 23.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He said to him حَيَّاكَ اللّٰهُ, explained<br>\
above: (Mgh:) originally, he prayed for his life:<br>\
and then, he prayed for him, absolutely: (Msb:)<br>\
he saluted him; (K, TA;) and so حيّاهُ تَحِيَّةَ<br>\
المُؤْمِنِ: (Lh, TA:) as used in the language of<br>\
the law, he said to him, سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكَ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\

↓ أَحْيَيْتُهَا [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  I gave life to, enlivened, or<br>\
revived, the fire] by blowing. (K.) [See also 2<br>\
in art. رهب; where a similar meaning is assigned<br>\
to the former verb; but perhaps it is there a<br>\
mistranscription.] مُحَايَاةٌ also signifies Nourishment (غِذَآء [which is properly speaking a subst.,<br>\
but seems to be here used as an inf. n.,]) for, or<br>\
of a child, (K, TA,) with that whereby is his<br>\
life, or, as in the M, because thereby is his life.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
احياهُ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. إِحْيَآءٌ, (TA,)<br>\
said of God, (S, Msb,) He made him alive, to<br>\
live, or be a living being; quickened, endued with<br>\
life, vivified, [revivified, revived, or resuscitated,]<br>\
him. (S, * Msb, * K.) Hence, in the Kur [lxxv.<br>\
last verse], أَلَيْسَ ذٰلِكَ بِقَادِرٍ أَنْ يُحْيِىَ المَوْتَى,<br>\
(S, TA,) i. e. Is not That Doer of these things<br>\
(Jel) [able to quicken the dead?]. ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 2,<br>\
in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  He (God) endued him with<br>\
the intellectual faculty: as in the saying, in<br>\
the Kur [vi. 122], أَوَمَنْ كَانَ مَيِّتًا فَأَحْيَيْنَاهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [And is he who was intellectually dead and<br>\
whom we have endued with the intellectual<br>\
faculty...?]. (Er-Rághib.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 3.<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  احيا الأَرْضَ (assumed tropical:)  He (God) revived the earth, or<br>\
land, by the rain, so as to produce in it plants,<br>\
or herbage. (TA.) And أُحْيِيَتِ الأَرْضُ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
land was tilled, and made productive. (AHn.)<br>\
And احيا المَوَاتِ (tropical:)  He turned to use the unowned<br>\
and unused and uncultivated land by walling it<br>\
round or sowing it or building upon it and the like.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also (assumed tropical:)  He (a man) found the land to<br>\
be fruitful, or abundant in herbage, (S, K,) with<br>\
fresh herbage. (K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  احيا اللَّيْلَ (assumed tropical:)  He passed<br>\
the night in religious service, worship, adoration,<br>\
or devotion, abstaining from sleep: (TA:) or<br>\
[simply] he remained awake during the night.<br>\
(W p. 9.) And احيا لَيْلَتَهُ He passed his night<br>\
awake. (MA.)<br>\
-A2-  احيت النَّاقَةُ The she-camel had<br>\
living offspring; (S, K;) her offspring seldom,<br>\
or never, died. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  احيا القَوْمُ The people, or<br>\
company of men, had their cattle living: (K:)<br>\
or had their cattle in good condition: (AA, S,<br>\
K:) or had rain, so that their beasts obtained<br>\
herbage to such a degree that they became fat:<br>\
(AZ:) or they (themselves) became in a state<br>\
of abundance of herbage, or plenty. (S, K. [See<br>\
also 1.])<br>\
5<br>\
تحيّا مِنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  He shrank from it: taken from<br>\
الحَيَآءُ [or الحَيَاةُ]; because it is of the nature of<br>\
the living to shrink: or it is originally تَحَوَّى;<br>\
the و being changed into ى; or [in other words]<br>\
from الحَىُّ “ the act of collecting,” [inf. n. of<br>\
حَوَاهُ,] like تَحَيَّزَ from الحَوْزُ. (TA.) [See<br>\
also 10.]<br>\
6<br>\
تَحَايَا as quasi-pass. of 3, He quickened,<br>\
enlivened, or revived, himself. See an ex. voce<br>\
رُوحٌ.]<br>\
10<br>\
استحياهُ He spared him; let him live; or<br>\
left him alive; (S, Msb, K, TA;) did not slay<br>\
him; (Msb;) in which sense the verb has but<br>\
one form: (Msb, TA:) or he left him; let him<br>\
alone; or forbore from him. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
as some say, (K,) إِنَّ اللّٰهَ لَا يَسْتَحْيِى أَنْ يَضْرِبَ<br>\
مَثَلًا, (S, K,) in the Kur [ii. 24], i. e. لَا يَسْتَبْقِى<br>\
[meaning Verily God will not spare to propound,<br>\
or refrain from propounding, a parable, or as a<br>\
parable]. (S.) [Hence, also,] إِنَّ اللّٰهَ يَسْتَحْيِى<br>\
مِنْ ذِى الشَّيْبَةِ المُسْلِمِ أَنْ يُعَذِّبَهُ, i. e. [Verily<br>\
God] forbears from punishing [the hoary Muslim]. (Er-Rághib.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [اِسْتَحْيَى, or اِسْتَحْيَا, which<br>\
latter is the more proper mode of writing it, also<br>\
signifies He felt, or had a sense of, or he was,<br>\
or became, moved or affected with, shame, shyness, or bashfulness; and particularly, but not<br>\
always, honest shame, or pudency, or modesty;<br>\
or his soul shrank from foul things; as also<br>\
اِسْتَحَى; and ↓ حَيِىَ, inf. n. حَيَآءٌ.] استحيى is<br>\
of the dial. of El-Hijáz; and استحى, with a<br>\
single ى, is of the dial. of Temeem; (Akh, S,<br>\
Msb;) the former being the original, (Akh, S,)<br>\
and that which is used in the Kur: (Msb:) in the<br>\
latter, the first ى [of the original] is suppressed,<br>\
[and its vowel is transferred to the ح,] to facilitate<br>\
the pronunciation, because of the occurrence of<br>\
the two ى s together: this is the opinion of Sb;<br>\
and with it agrees that of Aboo-&#39;Othmán [ElMázinee]: the opinion ascribed to Sb in the S,<br>\
namely, that اِسْتَحَيْتُ is changed from اِسْتَحْيَيْتُ<br>\
in like manner as اِسْتَبَعْتُ is changed from<br>\
اِسْتَبٌيَعْتُ, is that of Kh, and is disallowed by<br>\
El-Mázinee. (IB.) You say, استحيى منه, (S,<br>\
K, [in the CK, erroneously, عَنْهُ,]) or استحيا منه,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) and استحى منه, and استحياهُ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K, TA,) and استحاهُ; (TA, [and so in the<br>\
CK in the place of استحياهُ;]) as also منه ↓ حَيِىَ,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. يَحْيَا, (S,) inf. n. حَيَآءٌ;<br>\
(S, * Mgh, Msb, K;) He was ashamed of it or<br>\
on account of it, or ashamed to do it, or shy of<br>\
doing it; [generally meaning a foul thing;] he<br>\
was ashamed for himself, or of himself, or was bashful, or shy, with respect to it, or him; he was<br>\
abashed at, or shy of, it, or him; (K;) he shrank<br>\
from it, or him: (Msb, K: *) and استحيى مِنْ<br>\
كَذَا [or استحيا] He disdained, or scorned, such<br>\
a thing; abstained from it, or refused to do it,<br>\
by reason of disdain and pride; he dislike, or<br>\
hated, it, and his soul was above it; he shunned<br>\
it, avoided it, or kept himself far from it; syn.<br>\
أَنِفَ مِنْهُ. (TA.)<br>\
حَىَّ a verbal noun, (S, M, Mgh, TA,) and<br>\
therefore immediately followed by عَلَى, (M, TA,)<br>\
used as an imperative [addressed to a single<br>\
person, male or female, and to more than one];<br>\
(S;) used in calling, or summoning, or inviting,<br>\
and urging; (Lth, T, TA;) and having no verb<br>\
derived from it [alone, for حَيْعَلَ is derived from<br>\
حَىَّ and عَلَى together]; (Lth, T, Msb, TA;)<br>\
meaning Come: (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K, TA, &amp;c.:)<br>\
or come quickly: or hasten. (Mgh, TA.) Hence,<br>\
حَىَّ عَلَى الصَّلَاهٌ (in the أَذَان, TA) Come to<br>\
prayer: (IKt, S, M, Msb, K:) or come ye to<br>\
prayer: or come ye quickly: or hasten ye. (TA.)<br>\
And حَىَّ عَلَى الفَلَاحْ [in the same: see art.<br>\
فلح]. (Mgh, TA.) And حَىَّ عَلَى الغَدَآءِ [Come<br>\
to the morning-meal]: and على العَشَآءِ [to the<br>\
evening-meal]: (Msb:) and على الثَّرِيدِ [to the<br>\
crumbled bread moistened with broth]: (S:)<br>\
and على الخَيْرِ [to good, good fortune, prosperity,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (Lth, T, TA.) The saying of Ibn-Ahmar,<br>\
حَىَّ الحُمُولَ فَإِنَّ الرَّكْبَ قَدْ ذَهَبَا<br>\
means Keep thou to the loads [for the riders<br>\
upon the camels have gone]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In the<br>\
phrase حَىَّ هَلَ, and حَىَّ هَلًا, followed by عَلَى<br>\
كَذَا and إِلَى كَذَا, and حَىَّ هَلَا, (K,) which<br>\
last is used in a case of pausation, but is bad in<br>\
other cases, (S in art. هل,) and حَىَّ هَلْ, and<br>\
حَيَّهْل, [so in the copies of the K,] with the ه<br>\
quiescent, (K,) and حىّ هلن [app. حَىَّ هَلَنْ,<br>\
for حَىَّ هَلًا, or perhaps a mistranscription for<br>\
حَىَّ هَلَكَ], (TA,) [the most common rendering<br>\
of حَىَّ هَلَ &amp;c. is like that of حَىَّ alone, namely,<br>\
Come: or] حىّ signifies hasten thou; and [هل<br>\
or] هلا, come to it, or reach it; [so that the<br>\
meaning is hasten thou: come to such a thing:]<br>\
or حىّ signifies come; and [هل or] هلا, quickly<br>\
(حَثِيثًا), or be thou quick; [so that the meaning<br>\
is come quickly to such a thing:] or [هل or]<br>\
هلا signifies be thou quiet; and the meaning<br>\
is أَسْرِعْ عِنْدَ ذِكْرِهِ وَاسْكُنْ حَتَّى يَنْقَضِىَ [Speed<br>\
thou at the mention thereof, and be quiet<br>\
until it is finished]. (K.) Accord. to Abu-lKhattáb, the Arabs used to say, حَىَّ هَلَ الصَّلَاةَ,<br>\
meaning Come thou to prayer. (TA.) And one<br>\
says, حَىَّ هَلْ بِفُلَانٍ, (IAar, and so in the CK,)<br>\
and حَىَّ هَلًا بفلان, (IAar, and so in MS. copies<br>\
of the K,) and حَىَّ هَلَ بفلان, meaning Hasten<br>\
thou with such a one: (IAar:) or keep thou to such<br>\
a one, and call him. (K.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
إِذَا ذُكِرَ الصَّالِحُونَ فِحَىَّ هَلَ بِعُمَرَ, (S in art.<br>\
هل,) or فَحَيَّهَلًا بِعُمَرَ, (TA,) i. e. [When the good,<br>\
or righteous, are mentioned, then] keep thou to<br>\
&#39;Omar, and call &#39;Omar, (S ubi suprà, and TA,)<br>\
and begin with him, and be quick in mentioning<br>\
him; (TA;) for he is of such. (S ubi suprà.)<br>\
Accord. to some of the grammarians, (TA,) when<br>\
you say حَىَّ هَلًا, with tenween, it is as though<br>\
you said حَثًّا; and without tenween, it is as<br>\
though you said الحَثَّ; the tenween being made<br>\
a sign of indeterminateness; and the omission<br>\
of it, a sign of determinateness: and so it is<br>\
in all compounds of this kind. (K.) [See also<br>\
art. هل.]<br>\
حَىٌّ Living, having life, alive, or quick; contr.<br>\
of مَيِّتٌ [or مَيْتٌ]; (S, Mgh, * Msb, * K;) and<br>\
↓ حَيَوَانٌ is syn. with حَىٌّ [as meaning having<br>\
animal life]: (IB:) dim. of the former ↓ حُيَىٌّ:<br>\
(Msb:) and pl. أحْيَآءٌ. (Msb, K.) When you<br>\
say of a person, لَيْسَ بِحَىٍّ, you mean that he<br>\
is dead: (Lh:) but مِنْهَا ↓ ضُرِبَ ضَرْبَةً لَيْسَ بِحَاىٍ,<br>\
(Lh, K,) [in the CK ضَرَبَ, and] in [some of]<br>\
the copies of the K, erroneously, بِحَآءٍ, (TA,)<br>\
means [He was struck a blow] in consequence<br>\
of which he will not live: (Lh, K: *) like as the<br>\
saying لَا تَأْكُلْ كَذَا فَإِنَّكَ مَارِضٌ means Thou<br>\
wilt be sick if thou eat such a thing. (Lh, K.)<br>\
Accord. to ISh, one says, أَتَانَا حَىُّ فُلَانٍ, meaning Such a one came to us in his life [-time]:<br>\
and سَمِعْتُ حَىَّ فُلَانٍ يَقُولُ كَذَا, meaning I<br>\
heard such a one say thus in his life [-time]:<br>\
(TA:) [or the former may mean Such a one<br>\
himself came to us: and the latter, I heard such<br>\
a one himself say thus: for] حى [i. e. حَىّ as<br>\
a prefixed noun] is sometimes redundant, like<br>\
آل and ذُو: (Ham p. 308:) [and] IB says that<br>\
حَىُّ فُلَانٍ means Such a one himself. (TA.)<br>\
And they say, أَهْلِكَ ↓ كَيْفَ أَنْتَ وَحَيَّةُ, i. e. How<br>\
art thou, and those remaining alive of thy<br>\
family? (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to God, Deathless.<br>\

possessing the faculty of sensation. (Er-Rághib.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  [Intellectually alive;] possessing the faculty of<br>\

-b6-  (assumed tropical:)  Lively,<br>\
as meaning free from grief or sorrow. (Er-Rághib.)<br>\
―<br>\

unaltered by approaching the place of setting;<br>\
as though its setting were regarded as death:<br>\
(TA:) or still bright and white: or still hot and<br>\
powerful: but the former of these two meanings<br>\
is the more probable. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b10-  نَارٌ حَيَّةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [A<br>\
live, or burning, fire. (AHn.) ―<br>\
-b11-  طَرِيقٌ حَىٌّ<br>\

or a بَطْن of the بُطُون of the Arabs: (K, TA:)<br>\
pl. أَحْيَآءٌ. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
-A4-  The vulva, or external<br>\
portion of the organs of generation, of a woman.<br>\
(Az, K. See also حَيَآءٌ, of which حَىٌّ is also<br>\
said to be a pl.) Hence, سَعَفُ الحَىِّ, applied by<br>\
an Arab of the desert to The paraphernalia of a<br>\
bride. (Az, TA.)<br>\
-A5-  لَاحَىَّ عَنْهُ means لَامَنْعَ مِنْهُ,<br>\
(Ks, K, *) i. e. [There is no forbiddance of him;<br>\

-A6-  لَا يَعْرِفُ<br>\
الحَىَّ مِنَ اللَّىِّ He knows not, or will not know,<br>\
what is true from what is false; (IAar, K, Har<br>\
p. 236;) and so الحَوَّ من اللَّوِّ: (TA:) or the<br>\
حَوِيَّة [or winding gut, &amp;c.,] from the twisting of<br>\
the rope: (K:) or overt speech from covert: or<br>\
the living from the dead: or the act of turning<br>\
round, or winding, [see حَوَاهُ, (in art. حوى,)<br>\
of which حَىٌّ is an inf. n.,] from the act of<br>\
twisting. (Har ubi suprà.)<br>\
-A7-  The act of collecting. (TA. [But in this and some other senses it is<br>\
an inf. n. of حَوَى: see 1 in art. حوى.])<br>\
-A8-  أَحْيَآءٌ<br>\

حَيَّةٌ [A serpent;] a certain thing well known:<br>\
(K, TA:) [improperly explained in the Msb<br>\
as syn. with أَفْعًى:] applied to the male and the<br>\
female; (S, Msb;) the ة being added to denote<br>\
one of a kind, as in بَطَّةٌ and دَجَاجَةٌ; [although<br>\
حَىٌّ is not used as a coll. gen. n.; and] although<br>\
the saying عَلَى حَيَّةٍ ↓ رَأَيْتُ حَيًّا, as meaning [I<br>\
saw] a male [serpent] upon a female [serpent],<br>\
is related as having been heard from the Arabs:<br>\
(S:) but ↓ حَيُّوتٌ is also applied to the male;<br>\
(Az, S, K;) the ت being augmentative; for the<br>\
word is originally حَيُّو [or حَيُّوٌّ]: (Az, TA:) it<br>\
is said that it does not die unless by an accident:<br>\
and they say of a long-lived man, مَا هُوَ إِلَّا حَيَّةٌ<br>\
[He is none other than a serpent]; and in like<br>\
manner they say of a woman; as though it were<br>\
called حيّة because of its long life: [for] some,<br>\
including Sb, say that it is derived from حَيَاةٌ, as<br>\
the rel. n. is حَيَوِىٌّ, not حَوَوِىٌّ: and to him who<br>\
objects that one says رَجُلٌ حَوَّآءٌ [meaning “ a man<br>\
who collects serpents ”], it is replied that حَيَّةٌ<br>\
and حَوَّآءٌ are of different roots, like لُؤْلُؤٌ and لَأّلٌ,<br>\
&amp;c.: but it may be from تَحَوَّى, because of its<br>\
winding, or coiling, itself; and some say that<br>\
it is originally حَوْيَةٌ; some, that it is originally<br>\
حَيْوَةٌ: (TA:) [the dim. is ↓ حُيَيَّةٌ:] the pl. is<br>\
حَيَّاتٌ (K) and حَيْوَاتٌ, (K, TA,) or حَيَوَاتٌ. (So<br>\
in some copies of the K [agreeably with the dial.<br>\
of Hudheyl].) Hence the prov. هُوَ أَبْصَرُ مِنْ حَيَّةٍ<br>\
[He is more sharp-sighted than a serpent];<br>\
because of the sharpness of its sight: and أَظْلَمُ<br>\
مِنْ حَيَّةٍ [more wrongful in conduct than a<br>\
serpent]; because it comes to the burrow of the<br>\
[lizard called] ضَبّ, and eats its young one, and<br>\
takes up its abode in its burrow. (TA.) And<br>\
سَقَاهُ اللّٰهُ دَمَ الحَيَّاتِ [May God give him to drink<br>\

is cunning and mischievous, or malignant, (IAar,<br>\
K,) and intelligent, in the utmost degree: (IAar:)<br>\
[or] فلان حيّة الوادى means (assumed tropical:)  such a one is<br>\
strong in resisting, a defender of his possessions.<br>\
(TA.) And حَيَّةُ الوَادِى is also an appellation<br>\
applied to (assumed tropical:)  The lion; (K, TA;) because of his<br>\
cunning, or craftiness. (TA.) One says also,<br>\
هُمْ حَيَّةُ الأَرْضِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  They are cunning,<br>\
guileful, malignant, or mischievous, and strong,<br>\
not neglecting to take blood-revenge: so in a<br>\
saying of Dhu-l-Isba&#39; El-&#39;Adwánee cited voce<br>\
عَذِيرٌ. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ حَيَّةٌ ذَكَرٌ (S, TA) (assumed tropical:)  Such<br>\
a one is courageous and strong. (TA.) And<br>\
رَأْسُهُ رَأْسُ حَيَّةٍ (assumed tropical:)  He is clever, or ingenious; acute,<br>\
or sharp; intelligent. (TA.) And رَأَيْتُ فى كِتَابِهِ<br>\
حَيَّاتِ وَعَقَارِبَ (assumed tropical:)  I saw in his letter slanders, or<br>\
calumnies, addressed to the ruling power, in order<br>\
to cause the object thereof to fall into embarrassment from which escape would be difficult. (TA.)<br>\

Minor] and بَنَاتُ نَعْشٍ [meaning the stars in the<br>\
tail of Ursa Major]: (K:) so called by way of<br>\
comparison. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And حَيَّةٌ also signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A certain mark made with a hot iron upon<br>\
the neck, and upon the thigh, of a camel, twisting,<br>\
or winding, like the حَيَّة [properly so called]. (Ibn-<br>\
Habeeb, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also حَىٌّ.<br>\
حَيًا Rain; (S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ حَيَآءٌ: (K:)<br>\
or much rain: (Har p. 185:) as being the means<br>\
of giving life to the earth: (TA:) and (assumed tropical:)  plenty;<br>\
or abundance of herbage, (S, K,) and the means<br>\
of giving life to the earth and to men; as being<br>\
caused by the rain; and so ↓ حَيَآءٌ: (TA:) or<br>\
[simply] herbage; because produced by the rain:<br>\
and fat, and fatness; because produced by the<br>\
herbage: (Ham p. 662:) dual. حَيَيَانِ: (S:)<br>\

[which here means the same,] S,) of a camel,<br>\
(El-Fárábee, S, Msb, K,) or an animal having<br>\
feet like those of the camel, and of a cloven-hoofed<br>\
animal, and of a beast of prey: (K:) accord. to<br>\
AZ, the دُبُر [here meaning the same as فَرْج] of<br>\
any of these and of other animals: (Msb:)<br>\
accord. to IAar, it is of the ewe or she-goat, the<br>\
cow, and the gazelle: (ISd, TA:) and [sometimes] the فَرْج of a girl, (El-Fárábee, Msb,:) or<br>\
of a woman: (Zj in his “ Khalk el-Insán: ” [see<br>\
also حَىٌّ:]) and ↓ حَيًا signifies the same; (K;)<br>\
but accord. to Az, this is not allowable except in<br>\
poetry, in a case of necessity: (TA:) pl. أَحْيَآءٌ<br>\
(AZ, IJ, K) and أَحْيِيَةٌ (As, Sb, S, K) and, by<br>\
contraction, أَحِيَّةٌ, (Sb, IB, TA,) which is said to<br>\
be preferable, (TA,) and [quasi-pl. n.] ↓ حَىٌّ and<br>\
↓ حِىٌّ [which two have been mistaken by Freytag<br>\
for syns. of تَحِيَّةٌ, immediately following them in<br>\
the K]. (Sb, K.)<br>\
حَيَاةٌ, or ↓ حَيٰوة, (as in different copies of the K,<br>\
in the latter manner in copies of the S,) written<br>\
with و in the Kur, to show that و follows ى in<br>\
the pl. [حَيَوَاتٌ, like صَلَوَاتٌ], or because the sound<br>\
of the ا is inclined towards that of و, (ISd, TA,)<br>\
and ↓ حَيَوْةٌ, with sukoon to the و, (K,) which is<br>\
substituted for the ا of حَيَاةٌ, as is done by the<br>\
people of El-Yemen in the case of every ا that<br>\
is changed from و, as in صَلَاةٌ and زَكَاةٌ, though<br>\
the final radical letter of the verb of حَيَاةٌ is ى,<br>\
(TA,) an inf. n. of حَيِىَ in the first of the senses<br>\
explained in this art.; (IB, Mgh, Msb;) Life;<br>\
contr. of مَوْتٌ; (S, K;) as also ↓ حَيَوَانٌ and<br>\
↓ حِىٌّ, (K,) or this last is asserted to be a pl. of<br>\
حَيٰوةٌ, (S,) and as also ↓ مَحْيًا, (S, * Har pp. 25<br>\
and 350,) of which the pl. is مَحَاىٍ: (S:) حَيَاةٌ<br>\
signifies the faculty of growth, as in an animal,<br>\
and in a plant: and the faculty of sensation:<br>\
and (assumed tropical:)  the faculty of intellect: and (assumed tropical:)  freedom from<br>\
grief or sorrow: and everlasting life in the world<br>\
to come; to which one attains by that حياة which<br>\
is intelligence and knowledge: and the حياة that<br>\
is an attribute of God. (Er-Rághib.) يَا لَيْتَنِى<br>\
قَدَّمْتُ لِحَيَاتِى, in the Kur [lxxxix. 25], means<br>\
[O, would that I had prepared, or laid up in<br>\
store,] for my everlasting state of existence. (Er-Rághib.) And ↓ فَإِنَّ الدَّارَ الآخِرَةَ لَهِىَ الحَيَوَانُ,<br>\
in the Kur [xxix. 64], means [And verily the last<br>\
abode is] the abode of everlasting life: (TA:) or<br>\
الحيوان here means the life that will not be followed by death: or much life; like as مَوَتَانٌ<br>\
signifies much death: (Msb:) and it is also the<br>\
name of a certain fountain in Paradise, [the<br>\
water of] which touches nothing but it lives, by<br>\
permission of God. (TA.) الحَيٰوةُ الطَّيِّبَةُ, accord.<br>\
to I&#39;Ab, explaining xvi. 99 of the Kur, (TA,)<br>\
means Lawful means of subsistence (K, TA) in<br>\
the present world: (TA:) or Paradise. (K,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Advantage, or profit; or a cause,<br>\
or means, thereof: whence the saying, لَيْسَ لِفُلَانٍ<br>\
حَيَاةٌ There is not, in such a one, profit, nor good:<br>\
and so it is said to mean in the Kur [ii. 175],<br>\
وَلَكُمْ فِى القِصَاصِ حَيٰوةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [And there is to you, in<br>\
retaliation, an advantage]: (TA:) or this means<br>\
that the knowledge of the law of retaliation restrains from slaughter, and so is a cause of life to<br>\
two persons; and because they used to slay one<br>\
who was not the slayer, retaliation upon the slayer<br>\
is a cause of saving the lives of the rest: or the<br>\
meaning is life in the world to come; for when<br>\
the slayer has suffered retaliation in the present<br>\
world, he is not punished for his act in the world<br>\
to come. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b3-  حَيَاةُ الشَّمْسِ means (assumed tropical:)  The remaining of the light and whiteness of the sun: or<br>\
the remaining of its heat and power: but the<br>\
former of these two meanings is the more probable. (Mgh. [See الشَّمْسُ حَيَّةٌ, voce حَىٌّ.])<br>\
حَيٰوةٌ and حَيَوْةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
حَيِىٌّ Having حَيَآء [i. e. shame, shyness, bashfulness, pudency, or modesty]; (K;) part. n. of<br>\
حَيِىَ as syn. with استحيى; of the measure فَعِيلٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) fem. حَيِيَّةٌ. (TA.) The saying of I&#39;Ab,<br>\
اَللّٰهُ حَيِىٌّ, means God is one who acts with others<br>\
in the manner of him who has حَيَآء; for حَيَآء in<br>\
its proper sense is not ascribable to Him: (Mgh:)<br>\
or one who leaves undone evil deeds, and does good<br>\
deeds. (Er-Rághib.)<br>\

the serpent, the scorpion, and the crow, or the<br>\
scorpion, the crow, and the kite. (Es-Suyootee,<br>\

originally حَيَيَانٌ; (Sb, K, TA;) the ى which is<br>\
the final radical letter being changed into و<br>\
because the occurrence of two ى together is<br>\
disliked: (Sb, TA:) Aboo-&#39;Othmán [El-Má-<br>\
zinee] holds the و to be a radical letter; but his<br>\
opinion is said to be not admissible, because it is<br>\

the final و. (TA.)<br>\

حَاىٍ, of the measure فَاعِلٌ, [said to be] originally حَايِوٌ, is syn. with حَاوٍ and حَوَّآءٌ, belonging<br>\
to art. حوى [q. v.]. (Az, TA.)<br>\
أُحَىُّ and أُحَىٌّ and أُحَىٍّ: see art. حو.<br>\
أُحَيْوٍ: see art. حو.<br>\
أَحْيَى in the saying أَحْيَى مِنْ ضَبٍّ [More longlived than a ضبّ, a kind of lizard, which is supposed to live seven hundred years,] is from الحَيَاةُ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In the sayings أَحْيَى مِنْ هَدِىٍّ [More<br>\
shy, or bashful, than the bride] and أَحْيَى مِنْ<br>\
مُخَدَّرَةٍ [More shy, or bashful, than a girl kept<br>\
behind the curtain] it is from الحَيَآءُ. (TA.)<br>\
تِحْيَاةٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
التَّحَايِى The two stars in the foot and before<br>\
the foot of the foremost of Gemini: (Kzw:) or<br>\
three stars over against الهَنْعَة [which is the Sixth<br>\
Mansion of the Moon]; (IKt, K;) and sometimes the moon deviates from الهنعة, and makes<br>\
its abode in التحايى: (IKt:) they are between<br>\
the Milky Way and the stars that follow العَيُّوق<br>\
[or Capella]: Aboo-Ziyád El-Kilábee used to say<br>\
that this name means الهنعة, and is also pronounced<br>\
التَّحَائِى, withء: but AHn says that the moon<br>\
makes its abode in these stars, and not in الهنعة<br>\
itself: (TA:) its sing. is ↓ تِحْيَاةٌ; (IKt, AHn,<br>\
TA;) if so, of the measure تِفْعَلَةٌ, like تِحْلَبَةٌ, not<br>\
فِعْلَاةٌ, like عِزْهَاةٌ, because there is no such root as<br>\
تَحى; derived from الحَيَا, because its نَوْء [here<br>\
meaning its auroral setting, in midwinter,] is attended with much rain: but التحائى, with ء, is<br>\
irreg.; as though pl. of ↓ تَحِيَّةٌ likened to a word<br>\
of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ. (IB.)<br>\
تَحِيَّةٌ inf. n. of 2. (Mgh, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
A salutation, or greeting, (A&#39;Obeyd, AHeyth,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) pronounced by one person to another<br>\
on their meeting; (AHeyth;) particularly the<br>\
saying سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكَ; (Mgh, * Msb;) and the like;<br>\
(Mgh;) the most comprehensive form thereof,<br>\
used by the believer [to his fellow-believer], being<br>\
the saying السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ:<br>\
(AHeyth:) hence it is pluralized; the pl. being<br>\
تَحِيَّاتٌ and تَحَايَا. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Continuance,<br>\
or endurance; or endless, or everlasting, existence:<br>\
(IAar, Msb, K, &amp;c.:) and so it is said to mean<br>\
in the following verse of Zuheyr Ibn-Jenáb ElKelbee; who was a [kind of] king among his<br>\
people:<br>\
قَدْ نِلْتُهُ إِلَّا التَّحِيَّهْ  وَلَكُلُّ مَا نَالَ الفَتَى<br>\
[And indeed everything that the young man has<br>\
attained, I have attained it, except endless existence]: or, as some say, it here means security<br>\
from death and from evils. (TA. [But more<br>\
probably the meaning is that next following: for<br>\
in the Mz, 49th نوع, where this verse is cited, but<br>\
with مِنْ كُلِّ in the place of وَلَكُلُّ, he is said to<br>\
have been (not a king, but,) “ a nobleman. ” See<br>\
also, respecting him, p. x. of my Preface.]) And<br>\
(tropical:)  Dominion, or kingship: (Fr, AA, S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K, &amp;c.:) because the people of the Time of Ignorance used to greet kings [or rather those of<br>\
Himyer] by the saying أَبَيْتَ الَّعْنَ, which they<br>\
addressed to none other than a king; so that when<br>\
any one of them became a king, it was said of<br>\
him, فُلَانٌ نَالَ التَّحِيَّةَ [meaning (tropical:)  Such a one has<br>\
attained the kingship]. (Mgh: in which, and in<br>\
the S, the foregoing verse is cited as an ex. of this<br>\
last meaning.) التَّحِيَّاتُ لِلّٰهِ means Endless existence belongs to God: (Lth, Msb, TA:) or<br>\
dominion, or kingship: (Lth, Yaakoob, S, Msb,<br>\
TA:) or freedom, or security, from all evils,<br>\
(Khálid Ibn-Yezeed, AHeyth,) and from all<br>\
causes of the cessation of existence: (AHeyth:)<br>\
or endless existence, and security from evils, and<br>\
dominion, and the like: (Fr:) or the expressions<br>\
[of praise] that indicate and imply the ascription<br>\
of dominion and endless existence: (Kt:) or salutations and benedictions are Gods, and at his<br>\
disposal. (Mgh.) [التَّحِيَّاتُ is also a term applied to the following form of words repeated in<br>\
the ordinary prayers: التَّحِيَّاتُ لِلّٰهِ وَالصَّلَوَاتُ<br>\
وَالطَّيِّبَاتُ السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَاأَيُّهَا النَّبِىُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ<br>\
وَبَرَكَاتُهُ السَّلَامُ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى عِبَادِ اللّٰهِ الصَّالِحِينَ<br>\
أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَاهَ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ<br>\
وَرَسُولُهُ, or (instead of عبده ورسوله) رَسُولُ اللّٰهِ: see<br>\
5 in art. شهد.] ―<br>\
-b4-  The assigning to this word, as<br>\
used in the Kur iv. 88, the meaning of A gift is<br>\
a mistake. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  See also التَّحَايِى.<br>\
مَحْيًا: see حَيَاةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A time, and a place,<br>\
of life. (TA.)<br>\
مُحْىٍ and مُحْيِيَةٌ, applied to a she-camel,<br>\
Having living offspring; whose offspring seldom,<br>\
or never, die. (S.)<br>\
مُحَيًّا The face (S, K, Ham p. 23) of a man,<br>\
because it is specified in salutation; [see 2;] (Ham<br>\
ubi suprá;) a term used only in praise; (Ham<br>\
p. 640;) i. e. the face altogether: or the حُرّ<br>\
of the face [i. e. the ball of the cheek; or what<br>\
appears of the elevated part thereof; or what<br>\
fronts one, of the face, &amp;c.]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Of a horse,<br>\
it is The place where the flesh is separated (حيث<br>\
انفرق اللحم) beneath the forelock. (Ham p. 23.)<br>\
And دَائِرَةُ المُحَيَّا, in a horse, [The feather in] the<br>\
place of separation [of the hair] beneath the forelock, in the upper part of the forehead. (TA.)<br>\
محَيِّىٌ act. part. n. of 2; fem. مُحَيِّيَةٌ: (S,<br>\
TA:) for in every noun in which three ىs occur<br>\
together, [the last of them being the final radical,<br>\
and ending the word,] if it is not formed from a<br>\
verb, the final radical letter is elided from it, as in<br>\
عُطَىٌّ the dim. of عَطَآءٌ, and in أُحَىُّ the dim. of<br>\
أَحْوَى: but if it is formed from a verb, that letter<br>\
remains, as in مُحَيِّىٌ from حَيَّى. (S.)<br>\
أَرْضٌ مَحْيَاةٌ i. q. مَحْوَاةٌ, i. e. A land containing<br>\
serpents: (Ibn-Es-Sarráj, S:) or abounding with<br>\
serpents. (TA in art. حوى.)<br>\
أَبُو يَحْيَى Death. (TA, Har p. 218.)<br>\
