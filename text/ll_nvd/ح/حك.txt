حَكَّهُ, aor.<br>\
حَكُ3َ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. حَكٌّ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) [He scratched, scraped, rubbed, grated,<br>\
chafed, or fretted, it: or] he scraped off, abraded,<br>\
or otherwise removed, its superficial part: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) حَكٌّ signifies the act of scratching: (KL:)<br>\
or the making a body to pass upon another body<br>\
with collision: (K:) [as meaning scratching and<br>\
the like,] it is with the nail, and with the hand,<br>\
&amp;c. (TA.) مَا حَكَّ ظَهْرِى مِثْلُ يَدِى [Nothing<br>\
has scratched my back like my hand] is a prov.,<br>\
meaning that one should abstain from relying upon<br>\
others: and the same meaning is intended in the<br>\
following verse:<br>\
مَا حَكَّ جِلْدَكَ مِثْلُ ظُفْرِكْ<br>\
فَتَوَّلَ أَنْتَ جَمِيعَ أَمْرِكْ<br>\
[Nothing has scratched thy skin like thy nail: so<br>\
manage thou thyself all thine affair]. (Har<br>\
pp. 432 et seq.) The saying, in a trad., إِذَا حَكَكْتُ<br>\
قَرْحَةً دَمَّيْتُهَا [lit. When I scratch a sore, I make<br>\
it bleed,] means (tropical:)  when I desire an object, I attain it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] حَكَّ فِى صَدْرِى, and<br>\
↓ احكّ, and ↓ احتكّ, (K,) the first whereof, which<br>\
is mentioned by IDrd preceded by the negative<br>\
مَا, is the most approved, (TA,) (tropical:)  It wrought, or<br>\
operated, in, or upon, my mind: (K, TA:) said<br>\
of a suggestion of the devil, that comes into one&#39;s<br>\
mind. (TA.) Or حَكَّ فِى صَدْرِهِ كَذَا, aor.<br>\
حَكُ3َ,<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  Such a thing occurred to his mind as a<br>\
thing outweighed in probability, or a matter of<br>\
suspicion. (Msb.) And you say مَا حَكَّ فِى صَدْرِى<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  It did not make an impression upon my mind.<br>\
(Har p. 648.) It is said in a trad., الإِثْمُ مَا حَكَّ<br>\
فِى صَدْرِكَ (assumed tropical:)  Sin is that which makes an impression<br>\
upon thy mind, and induces a suspicion that it is<br>\
an act of disobedience, because the mind is not<br>\
dilated thereby. (Mgh. [See also حَاكَ, in arts.<br>\
حوك and حيك; and see حَزَّ.]) You say also,<br>\
مَا حَكَّ فِى صَدْرِى مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ (tropical:)  Nothing thereof was<br>\
unsettled, so as to be doubtful, in my mind. (S,<br>\
TA.) And مَا حَكَّ فِى صَدْرِى كَذَا (tropical:)  Such a thing<br>\
did not cause dilatation [or pleasure] in my mind.<br>\

a subst. predominates. (TA.) So in the saying,<br>\
مَا بَقِيتَ فِى فِيهِ حَاكَّةٌ [There remained not in<br>\
his mouth a tooth]. (S.) The Arabs also say,<br>\

men: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K:) [app. meaning thou art<br>\
not the man to cope with him, or to accomplish<br>\
it.]<br>\

pieces of money &amp;c. are rubbed to try their quality;] the stone of the نَقَّادُون. (Har p. 66.) [It<br>\

which also signifies a stone for rubbing the soles<br>\
of the feet, &amp;c.: and a rasp.]<br>\

thing that is set up in the place where camels lie<br>\
down, at their watering-place, for the mangy<br>\

أَنَا جُذَيْلُهَا المُحَكَّكُ وَعُذَيْقُهَا المُرَجَّبُ, [see جِذْلٌ,]<br>\
meaning I am he by means of whose counsel, or<br>\
advice, and forecast, relief is sought: (S, K: *) or<br>\
it has another meaning, preferred by Az, i. e.,<br>\
that the sayer was one who had been strengthened<br>\
by experience, who had experienced and known<br>\
affairs, and been tried, or proved, by them, and<br>\
found to be one who bore up against difficulty,<br>\
strong and firm, such as would not flee from his<br>\
adversary: or the meaning is, I am, exclusively<br>\
of [the rest of] the Ansár, a rubbing-post for him<br>\
who would oppose me, and with me should the<br>\
stubborn be coupled: the dim. form is here used<br>\
for the purpose of aggrandizement. (TA.) [See<br>\
also حِكَاكٌ.]<br>\
