حَوْصٌ (S, A, Mgh, K) and حِيَاصَةٌ, (A, TA,) He<br>\
sewed it, or sewed it up or together; (S, * A,<br>\
Mgh, * K, TA;) namely, a garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth: (A, TA:) or he sewed it with stitches far<br>\
apart: (IB, TA:) or he sewed it without a<br>\
patch; and only said of a skin, or of skin, and<br>\
of a camel&#39;s foot. (TA.) Hence the prov., إِنَّ<br>\
دَوَآءَ الشَّقِّ أَنْ تَحُوصَهُ [Verily the remedy for the<br>\
rent is that thou sew it up]. (A, K.) [And<br>\
hence the saying,] لَأَطْعَنَنَّ فِى حَوْصِهِمْ (S, A)<br>\
(tropical:)  I will assuredly mar what they have repaired:<br>\
(A:) or I will assuredly make a hole in what they<br>\
have sewed up, and I will assuredly mar what<br>\
they have repaired. (S, IB.) Or لَأَطْعَنَنَّ فِى حَوْصِكَ<br>\
(tropical:)  I will assuredly circumvent thee, (لَأَكِيدَنَّكَ [so<br>\
in copies of the K, and in the TA, but in the<br>\
CK, erroneously, لَاكْبِدَنَّكَ,]) and I will assuredly<br>\
labour for thy destruction. (AZ, K.) And it is<br>\
said in a prov., طَعَنَ فِى حَوْصِ أَمْرٍ لَيْسَ مِنْهُ فِى<br>\
شَىْءٍ, (K,) and أَمْرٍ ↓ حُوصِ, and أَمْرٍ ↓ حُوصَى, (Yoo,<br>\
K,) (tropical:)  He laboured at that which he could not do<br>\
well, and tasked himself to do that with which he<br>\
had no concern. (ISh, K.) Or طَعَنْتَ فِى حَوْصِ<br>\
أَمْرٍ لَسْتَ مِنْهُ فِى شَىْءٍ (tropical:)  Thou hast spoken of a<br>\
thing with which thou hast no concern. (A.)<br>\

فِى ضَرْبِهِمْ (tropical:)  Before I penetrate into the case of<br>\
the people, and test them, I am ambitious of<br>\
smiting them. (A.) And مَا طَعَنْتَ فِى حَوْصِهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  Thou hast not attained the object of thy desire<br>\
[with respect to him or it: or perhaps the right<br>\
reading is حَوْصِكَ, in which case the addition<br>\
which I have made should be omitted]. (IB, as<br>\
quoted in the L and TA.) ―<br>\

-b4-  حَوْصٌ also signifies The making<br>\
a coarctation between two things; (S, K;) and<br>\
so حِيَاصَةٌ. (K.) You say حَاصَ بَيْنَهُمَا [He contracted the space between them; meaning two<br>\
things]. (TK.)<br>\
