حَثْمَةٌ A hill, or rising ground; (Msb;) as also<br>\
↓ حَثَمَةٌ: (Az, as heard from the Arabs; and TA:)<br>\
or a red [hill such as is termed] أَكَمَة: (S:) or<br>\
a small red أَكَمَة: (K:) or a black اكمة consisting of stones: (M, K:) as also ↓ حَثَمَةٌ: (K:)<br>\
or, as some say, an elevated road: (Msb:) pl.<br>\
حِثَامٌ (K, * TA) and حَثَمَاثٌ: (TA:) and ↓ حَثْمٌ<br>\
[as a coll. gen. n.] signifies elevated roads. (TA.)<br>\
حَثَمَةٌ: see حَثْمَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
حثو and حثى<br>\
1<br>\
حَثَا الثُّرَابَ and<br>\
حَثَى التراب, (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K,) the latter of which is the more usual, or more<br>\
supported by authority, (TA,) aor. يَحْثُو and<br>\
يَحْثِى, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. حَثْوٌ and حَثْىٌ (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K) and تَحْثَآءٌ, (S,) He poured dust<br>\
(Msb, TA) with his hand; (Msb;) threw it,<br>\
or cast it; (TA;) or seized it with his hand<br>\
and threw it; (Mgh, Msb;) عَلَيْهِ [upon him,<br>\
or it], (K,) and فِى وَجْهِهِ [in his face]: (S,<br>\
Msb:) الحَثْىُ and الهَيْلُ both signify the pouring of dust; but the former, not without [first]<br>\
raising it; and the latter, the sending forth,<br>\
or down, without raising. (Ham p. 477.) [See<br>\
an ex. in a verse cited in art. اى, conj. 6.]<br>\
Accord. to IAth, the saying, in a trad., اُِحْثُوا فِى<br>\
وُجُوهِ المَدَّاحِينَ التُّرَابَ means (assumed tropical:)  [Repel ye with]<br>\
disappointment [those who praise much]: but<br>\
some make it to have its overt meaning [of throw<br>\
ye dust in the faces of those who praise much].<br>\
(TA.) The verb is also used in relation to water;<br>\
as in the saying, ↓ يَكْفِيهِ أَنْ يَحْثُوَ ثَلَاثَ حَثَوَاتٍ,<br>\
(Msb,) and كَانَ يَحْثِى ثَلَاثَ حَثَيَاتٍ, (TA, [and<br>\
the like is said in the Mgh,]) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [It is sufficient for him to throw, and he used to throw,]<br>\
three handfuls [of water]. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  حَثَى<br>\
said of a jerboa means He went so deep into his<br>\
hole that he could not be dug out, the direction of<br>\
his hole being unknown, and it being seen to be<br>\
filled with dust, or earth, even with the rest of<br>\
the ground. (TA in art. حفر.) The jerboa throws<br>\
up (يَحْثُو) the dust, or earth, from his hole.<br>\
(IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  حَثَوْتُ لَهُ also means (assumed tropical:)  I gave him<br>\
something little in quantity, or paltry. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  You say also, حَثَا التُّرَابُ or حَثَى, aor. يَحْثُو<br>\
and يَحْثِى; (K;) so in the copies of the K, but<br>\
correctly يَحْثَا, [or rather يَحْثَى,] which is extr.,<br>\
like جَبَا [or جَبَى], aor. يَجْبَا [or يَجْبَى], and قَلَا<br>\
[or قَلَى], aor. يَقْلَا [or يَقْلَى]; i. e. The dust<br>\
became poured; or thrown, or cast. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
احثى الأَرْضَ and<br>\
أَحَاثَهَا [He turned, or<br>\
threw, up the earth, or ground, searching for<br>\
what was in it:] both signify the same. (TA in<br>\
art. حوث.) And أَحْثَتِ الخَيْلُ البِلَادَ The horses<br>\
bruised, or crushed, the regions [with their hoofs];<br>\
as also أَحَاثَتْهَا. (K.)<br>\
10<br>\
اِسْتَحْثَوْا They threw, or cast, dust, each in<br>\
another&#39;s face. (TA.)<br>\
حَثًا (S, ISd, TA) and حَثًى (K, TA) Dust<br>\
poured; or thrown, or cast: (ISd, K, TA:) or<br>\
dust being poured; or being thrown, or cast:<br>\
dual حَثَوَانِ and حَثَيَانِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K,)<br>\
written in both ways as above, (TA,) The skins<br>\
(قُشُور) of dates; (K;) and the bad thereof:<br>\
(TA:) [like حَتِىٌّ:] pl. of حَثَاةٌ: (K:) [or rather<br>\
this is a n. un., and what is called the pl. is a<br>\
coll. gen. n.;] like حَصَاةٌ and حَصًا. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And Straw (تِبْن [in the CK. erroneously, تِين]):<br>\
(K, TA:) or broken pieces thereof; (Lh, S, K;)<br>\
i. e., of straw: (Lh, S:) or straw (تِبْن [in the<br>\
CK, again, تِين]) separated from the grain. (K.)<br>\
حَثْىٌ What is raised with the hand [to be poured,<br>\
or to be thrown, or cast, therefrom; of dust;<br>\
and also (assumed tropical:)  of water]; (K, TA;) or, as in some<br>\
copies of the K, with the two hands: and so<br>\
[↓ حَثْوَةٌ and] ↓ حَثْيَةٌ; [or rather these signify a<br>\
single handful of dust, and (assumed tropical:)  of water, raised to<br>\
be poured or thrown;] pl. [حَثَواتٌ and] حَثَيَاتٌ.<br>\
(TA.) See 1.<br>\

حَثْيَةٌ; pl. حَثَيَاتٌ: see حَثْىٌ.<br>\
أَرْضٌ حَثْوَآءُ Land abounding in dust: (S, K:)<br>\
but IDrd says that it is asserted to be not of established authority. (TA.)<br>\
حَاثِيَآءُ One of the holes of the jerboa; (TA;)<br>\
like نَافِقَآءُ: (K:) or the dust, or earth, of the<br>\
jerboa, (IAar, K, * TA,) which he throws up<br>\
with his legs from his hole: (IAar, TA:) pl.<br>\
حَوَاثٍ [like as نَوَافِقُ is pl. of نَافِقَآءُ]. (IB, TA.)<br>\
مَحْثُوٌّ (K) and ↓ مَحْثِىٌّ (ISd, TA) Dust poured;<br>\
or thrown, or cast. (K, * TA.) ↓ يَا لَيْتَنِى المَحْثِىُّ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ [O would that I were he upon whom dust<br>\
is poured, or thrown: (in Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov.<br>\
ii. 920, المُحْثٰى:)] said on the occasion of wishing to be in the condition of him of whom the<br>\
honourable treatment that he receives is concealed,<br>\
and of whom the contemptuous treatment that<br>\
he receives is made apparent: originating from<br>\
the fact that a man was sitting with a woman,<br>\
and a man attached to her approached; so, when<br>\
she saw him, she threw dust in his [the former&#39;s]<br>\
face, to show this man who was sitting with her<br>\
that he should not draw near to her, lest their<br>\
case should become known. (TA.)<br>\
