حَدَثَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
حَدُثَ, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. حُدُوثٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and حَدَاثَةٌ,<br>\
(A, K,) It was new, or recent; contr. of قَدُمَ:<br>\
(S, * A, K:) it (a thing) came into existence;<br>\
began to be; had a beginning; began, or originated; existed newly, for the first time, not<br>\
having been before: (S, Mgh, Msb, TA:) but<br>\
when mentioned with قَدُمَ, it is written حَدُثَ,<br>\
with damm to the د, (S, Mgh, K,) as in the<br>\
saying, أَخَذَنِى مَا قَدُمَ وَمَاحَدُثَ, (S,) or أَخَذَهُ<br>\
الخ, (A, Mgh,) meaning Old and new anxieties<br>\
and thoughts [came into my mind, or his mind,<br>\
or overcame me, or him]; (TA;) or old and new<br>\
griefs or sorrows; (Mgh;) the former saying<br>\
occurring in a trad.: (TA:) the verb is not thus<br>\
in any other case [in this sense]. (S.) You say,<br>\
حَدَثَ بِهِ عَيْبٌ A vice, or fault, or the like, originated in him, or it, not having been before.<br>\
(Msb.) And حَدَثَ أَمْرٌ An affair, or event,<br>\
originated: (Mgh:) or happened, or came to pass.<br>\
(S.) حُدُوثٌ is of two kinds: حُدُوثٌ زَمَانِىٌّ,<br>\
which is A thing&#39;s being preceded by non-existence: and حُدُوثٌ ذَاتِىٌّ, which is a thing&#39;s being<br>\
dependent upon another for its existence. (KT.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  حَدَاثَةٌ and حُدُوثَةٌ, [as inf. ns. of which the<br>\
verb, if they have one, is, accord. to analogy,<br>\
حَدُثَ,] relating to a man, signify The being<br>\
young; or [as simple substs.] youthfulness.<br>\
(ISd, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
حدّثهُ [He told him, or related to him,<br>\
something; he discoursed to him, or talked to<br>\
him: see also 5]. You say, حدّثهُ الحَدِيثَ, (L,)<br>\
and حدّثهُ بِهِ, (A, * L,) inf. n. تَحْدِيثٌ, a word of<br>\
well-known meaning, (S,) He told him, or related<br>\
to him, the story, or narrative, or tradition. (L.)<br>\
[And حدّث He related traditions of Mohammad:<br>\
and حدّث عن فُلَانٍ he related such traditions<br>\
heard, or learned, from such a one: the verb in<br>\
this sense being an Islámee term.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
تَرِكْتُ البِلَادَ تُحَدِّثُ (assumed tropical:)  I left the countries, or<br>\
towns, resounding with a buzzing, or confused<br>\
noise. (Th, ISd.)<br>\
3<br>\
حادث سَيْفَهُ, (TA,) inf. n. مُحَادَثَةٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
He polished his sword; (S, * K, * TA;) [as though<br>\
he made it new by doing so;] as also ↓ احدثهُ,<br>\
(TA,) inf. n. إِحْدَاثٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, حَادِثُوا هٰذِهِ<br>\
القُلُوبَ بِذِكْرِ اللّٰهِ فَإِنَّهَا سَرِيعَةُ الدُّثُورِ (assumed tropical:)  Polish and<br>\
cleanse ye these hearts by the remembrance of<br>\
God, like as the sword is polished: [for they<br>\
quickly become sullied:] a trad. of El-Hasan.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  مُحَادَثَةٌ and ↓ تَحَادُثٌ, words of wellknown meaning, (S,) are syn.: (K:) [but the<br>\
former generally relates to two persons: the<br>\
latter, to more than two:] you say, حادث صَاحِبَهُ<br>\
[He talked, or conversed in words, with his companion]: (A:) and حادثوا and ↓ تحادثوا [They<br>\
talked, or conversed in words, together, or one<br>\
with another]. (TK.)<br>\
4<br>\
احدثهُ (S, A, Msb, TA) and ↓ استحدثهُ (A)<br>\
He (God, S, or a man, Msb) brought it into existence, caused it to be, made it, produced it, effected<br>\
it, or did it, newly, for the first time, it not having<br>\
been before; began it, or originated it; invented<br>\
it; innovated it. (S, Msb, TA.) [Hence,] احدث<br>\
أَمْرَا [He brought to pass an event]. (Kur lxv. 1.)<br>\
And احدث حَدَثًا He originated an innovation<br>\
[see حَدَثٌ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 3. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also احدث,<br>\
(S, L, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِحْدَاثٌ, (Msb,) from<br>\
الحَدَثُ, (S,) (assumed tropical:)  He voided his ordure; or broke<br>\
wind: (L, K:) it has both these meanings: (L:)<br>\
or he did a thing that annulled his state of legal<br>\
purity. (Msb.) [See حَدَثٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  He committed adultery, or fornication: (K, TA:) and<br>\
in like manner one says of a woman [احدثت].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تحدّث [He talked; conversed in words;<br>\
told, or related, stories, or narratives]. (S.) And<br>\
تحدّث بِهِ [He talked of it; told it; related it];<br>\

(tropical:)  [God shall send the clouds, and they shall laugh<br>\
with the best laughing, and talk with the best<br>\
talking]: the talking here mentioned, says IAth,<br>\
is said to mean thundering; and the laughing,<br>\
lightning; thundering being likened to talking<br>\
because it announces rain, and its near coming:<br>\
or by laughing may be meant the smiling of the<br>\
earth, and the appearing of the flowers or blossome; and by talking, the talking of men in<br>\
describing and mentioning the plants or herbage:<br>\
this figure of speech is termed مَجَازٌ تَعْلِيقِىٌّ, and<br>\
is one of the most approved kinds of مجاز. (TA.)<br>\

تَحَاْدَثَ see 3, in two places.<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَحْدَثَ see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also, استحدث خَبَرًا He<br>\
found new tidings or information: (S:) or he<br>\
gained, or acquired, tidings or information. (A.)<br>\
رَجُلٌ حِدْثٌ and ↓ حَدُثٌ and ↓ حَدِثٌ and ↓ حِدِّيثٌ<br>\
(K) and ↓ مُحَدِّثٌ (L) A man of many stories or<br>\
narratives, (L, K,) and who relates them well: (L:)<br>\
or ↓ رَجُلٌ حَدُثٌ and ↓ حَدِثٌ signify a man who<br>\
relates stories, or narratives, well: and رَجُلٌ<br>\
↓ حِدِّيثٌ signifies a man of many stories or narratives; (S, A, El-Wá&#39;ee;) but is used by the<br>\
vulgar to signify a man who relates stories, or<br>\
narratives, well. (El-Wá&#39;ee, TA.) And you say<br>\
رَجُلٌ حِدْثُ مُلُوكٍ A man who is a companion of<br>\
kings in talk (S, A, K) and in their nocturnal<br>\
conversations: (S:) and حِدْثُ نِسَآءٍ one who talks<br>\
to women; (S, A;) or who talks with women.<br>\
(Az, TA in art. تبع.) And ↓ هُوَ حِدِّيثُهُ [He is<br>\
his story-teller]. (A.)<br>\
حَدَثٌ A novelty, or new thing; an innovation;<br>\
a thing not known before: and particularly relating to El-Islám [i. e. to matters of religious<br>\
doctrine or practice or the like]: (Mgh:) [and<br>\
so ↓ أَمْرٌ مُحْدَثٌ; for] مُحْدَثَاتُ الأُمُورِ (pl. of<br>\
مُحْدَثٌ, TA) signifies innovations of people of<br>\
erroneous opinions, (Msb, TA,) inconsistent with<br>\
the doctrines, or practices, of the just of preceding times: or what is not known in revealed<br>\
scripture, nor in the Sunneh, nor in the general<br>\
conventional tenets of the doctors of the law:<br>\
and حَدَثٌ, [in like manner,] an innovation that<br>\
is disapproved, not agreeable with custom, or<br>\
usage, and not known in the Sunneh. (TA.)<br>\
↓ آوَى مُحْدَثًا, occurring in a trad., means He<br>\
entertained an innovation; [i. e. he embraced,<br>\
or held, it;] or he was content, or pleased, with<br>\
it; or he bore it patiently: or, as some say, it<br>\
is ↓ آوَى مُحْدِثًا, meaning he entertained, or harboured in his dwelling, a criminal, or an offender,<br>\
and protected him from retaliation. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also i. q. ↓ حَادِثَةٌ and ↓ حَدَثَانٌ [in some copies<br>\
of the S ↓ حِدْثَان] and ↓ حُدْثَى [signifying An<br>\
accident, an event, a hap, or a casualty: and<br>\
generally an evil accident or event, a mishap, a<br>\
misfortune, a disaster, a calamity, or an affliction]: (S:) [the most common of these words<br>\
is ↓ حَادِثَةٌ; and its pl., حَوَادِثُ, is more common<br>\
than the sing.:] the pl. of حَدَثٌ is أَحْدَاثٌ.<br>\
(TA.) أَحْدَاثُ الدَّهْرِ and ↓ حَوَادِثُهُ (A, K) and<br>\
↓ حِدْثَانُهُ, (K,) or, as is said by Fr and others,<br>\
this last is ↓ حَدَثَانُهُ, (TA,) signify The accidents,<br>\
or casualties, of time or fortune; or the evil<br>\
accidents, or calamities, of time or fortune. (A,<br>\
K.) ↓ حَوَادِثُ occurs used as a sing., said to be<br>\
put by poetic license for ↓ حَدَثَانٌ: and this<br>\
latter is also used [as a pl.] for حَوَادِثُ: so say<br>\
Az and AAF: and it is said to be a noun in the<br>\
sense of حَوَادِثُ الدَّهْرِ and نَوَائِبُ الدَّهْرِ: accord.<br>\
to Fr, the Arabs say, [using it as a pl.,] أَهْلَكَتْنَا<br>\
الحَدَثَانُ [The accidents, or evil accidents, of<br>\
time, or fortune, destroyed us]: some say<br>\
الحَدَثَانِ, making it dual of حَدَثٌ, and meaning<br>\
thereby the night and day; like as they say [in<br>\
the same sense] الجَدِيدَانِ and المَلَوَانِ &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence] حَدَثٌ is a term applied by Sb to<br>\
The مَصْدَر [or infinitive noun]; because all مصادِر<br>\
are [significant of] accidents [considered as subsisting in, or proceding from, agents]: and the<br>\
pl. which he assigns to it in this sense is أَحْدَاثٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  The voiding of ordure; or the breaking of wind; syn. إِبْدَآءٌ: (K:) or legal impurity<br>\
that forbids, or prevents, one&#39;s performing prayer<br>\
&amp;c.: (KT:) or a state annulling legal purity:<br>\
pl. أَحْدَاثٌ. (Msb.) [See 4.] ―<br>\
-b5-  I. q. وَلِىٌّ (assumed tropical:)  [The<br>\
rain following that called the وَسْمِىّ]: (L:) or<br>\
الأَحْدَاثُ [pl. of الحَدَثُ] signifies the rains of<br>\
the commencement, or first part, of the year.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Young, applied to a man, (A, * L, Msb, *)<br>\
and to a horse or an ass or the like, and a camel,<br>\
and, accord. to IAar, to a mountain-goat: (L:)<br>\
pl. أَحْدَاثٌ (A, L, Msb,) and حُدْثَانٌ. (L.) You<br>\
say رَجُلٌ حَدَثٌ, (Th, S, L, &amp;c.,) and ↓ حَدِيثُ<br>\
السِّنِّ, (Th, S, A, Msb, K,) and حَدَثُ السِّنّ, (IDrd,<br>\
K, [but this is by some disallowed, as will be<br>\
seen below,]) A young man: (S, L, Msb, K:)<br>\
and in the pl. sense you say غِلْمَانٌ أَحْدَاثٌ and<br>\
حُدْثَانٌ [pls. of حَدَثٌ], (S,) and رِجَالٌ أَحْدَاثُ<br>\
السِّنِّ and حُدْثَانُ السِّنِّ, [or these, as is implied<br>\
above, are not allowable,] and حُدَثَآءُ السِّنِّ [pl.<br>\
of ↓ حَدِيثٌ]. (ISd, TA.) J says, [in the S,]<br>\
if you mention the سِنّ, you say السِّنِّ ↓ حَدِيثُ<br>\
[lit. Young of tooth]: and IDrst says, the vulgar<br>\
say, هُوَ حَدَثُ السِّنِّ, like as you say حديث السِّنِّ;<br>\
but it is a mistake; for حَدَثٌ is an epithet applied<br>\
to the man himself, and is originally an inf. n.;<br>\
one should not apply it as an epithet to the سِنّ<br>\
nor to the ضِرْس nor to the ناب; but ↓ حَدِيثٌ is<br>\
an epithet applied to anything recent. (TA.)<br>\
حَدُثٌ: see حَدَثٌ, first sentence; each in<br>\
two places.<br>\
حَدِثٌ: see حَدَثٌ, first sentence; each in<br>\
two places.<br>\
حَدِثٌ: see حَدَثٌ.<br>\
حُدْثَى: see what next follows.<br>\
حِدْثَانٌ The first, or beginning, or commencement, of a state, or a case, or an affair; (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, K;) as also ↓ حَدَاثَةٌ: (S, Mgh, K:)<br>\
and its freshness; which is also a signification<br>\
of both these words. (S, Mgh.) So in the saying,<br>\
اِفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ الأَمْرَ بِحِدْثَانِهِ and ↓ بِحَدَاثَتِهِ [Do thou<br>\
that thing while it is in its first and fresh state].<br>\
(S, Mgh. *) One says also, أَتَيْتُهُ فِى حِدْثَانِ شَبَابِهِ<br>\
and شبابه ↓ حِدْثَى and شبابه ↓ حَدِيثِ (assumed tropical:)  I came<br>\
to him in the beginning, or first period, of his<br>\
youth. (Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee, TA.) And<br>\
it is said in a trad., addressed to &#39;Áïsheh, لَوْلَا<br>\
حِدْثَانُ قَوْمِكِ بِالكُفْرِ لَهَدَمْتُ الكَعْبَةَ وَبَنَيْتُهَا, (Mgh, *<br>\
TA,) or, as some relate it, قومك ↓ حَدَاثَةُ, which<br>\
means the same, (Mgh,) i. e. Were it not for the<br>\
shortness of the period that has elapsed since thy<br>\
people were in the state of infidelity, I would<br>\
pull down the Kaabeh, and build it [anew]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also حَدَثٌ, in two places.<br>\
حَدَثَانٌ, used as a sing. and as a pl.: see حدثٌ,<br>\
in three places.<br>\
حَدِيثٌ New, recent; (K;) contr. of قَدِيمٌ:<br>\
(S:) having, or having had, a beginning; existing newly, for the first time, not having been<br>\
before; as also ↓ حَادِثٌ: (Msb:) brought into<br>\
existence, caused to be, made, produced, or done,<br>\
newly, for the first time, not having been before;<br>\
begun, or originated; invented; innovated; as<br>\
also ↓ مُحْدَثٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See حَدَثٌ, last two<br>\
sentences, in four places. And see حِدْثَانٌ. You<br>\
say also, هُوَ حَدِيثُ عَهْدٍ بِالإِسْلَامِ He is, or was,<br>\
recently become a Muslim. (Msb.) And حَدِيثُو<br>\
عَهْدٍ بِكُفْرِهِمْ, (TA,) or بِالجَاهِلِيَّةِ, or حَدِيثٌ عَهْدُهُمْ,<br>\
(Mgh,) Men lately in their state of infidelity [or<br>\
in the state of paganism or ignorance]; who have<br>\
but recently ceased to be in their state of infidelity<br>\
[&amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. خَبَرٌ [Information; a<br>\
piece of information; intelligence; an announcement; news, or tidings; a piece of news; an<br>\
account; a narration, or narrative; a story;<br>\
&amp;c.]; (S, K;) employed to signify little and<br>\
much; (S;) and ↓ حِدِّيثَى signifies the same:<br>\
(K:) or a thing, or matter, that is talked of,<br>\
told, or narrated, and transmitted: (Msb:) [and<br>\
talk, or discourse:] and [in like manner] ↓ أُحْدُوثَةٌ<br>\
signifies a thing that is talked of, told, or narrated: (S, K:) or this last signifies a wonderful<br>\
thing: (IB, TA:) it has been asserted, says<br>\
MF, that there is no difference between احدوثة<br>\
and حديث in usage, and in denoting what is<br>\
good and what is evil; in contradiction to such<br>\
as say that the former peculiarly signifies that<br>\
[kind of story] in which there is no profit nor<br>\
any truth; such as amatory stories, and the like<br>\
fictions of the Arabs: Fr asserts it to signify<br>\
peculiarly a laughable and an absurd story; differing from حديث: and Ibn-Hishám El-Lakhmee,<br>\
in his Expos of the Fs, says that it is only used<br>\
to denote what is bad, or evil: but Lb replies<br>\
against him, in his Expos., that it is sometimes<br>\
used to denote what is good; as in a saying<br>\
mentioned by Yaakoob, which see below: (TA:)<br>\
the pl. of حَدِيثٌ is أَحَادِيثُ, contr. to analogy,<br>\
(S, K,) said by Fr to be pl. of ↓ أُحْدُوثَةٌ, and<br>\
then used as pl. of حديث, (S,) but IB says<br>\
that this is not the case; (TA;) and حِدْثَانٌ and<br>\
حُدْثَانٌ are also pls. of حديث, (K, TA,) sometimes occurring; the latter, rare. (TA.) You<br>\
say, سَمِعْتُ حَدِيثًا حَسَنًا (TA) and حَسَنَةً ↓ حِدِّيثَى<br>\
(S, A, * TA) [I heard a good story or narrative<br>\
&amp;c.]; both meaning the same. (TA.) And اِنْتَشَرَ<br>\
حَسَنَةٌ ↓ لَهُ فِى النَّاسِ أُحْدُوثَةٌ [A good story of<br>\
him became spread abroad among the people]:<br>\
a saying mentioned by Yaakoob in his “ Isláh. ”<br>\
(TA.) And مَلِيحَةٌ ↓ أثحْدُوثَةٌ [A pretty story],<br>\
and أَحَادِيثُ مِلَاحٌ [pretty stories]. (A.) And<br>\
↓ قَدْ صَارَ فُلَانٌ أَحْدُوثَةً [(tropical:)  Such a one has become<br>\
the subject of a story, or of a wonderful story:<br>\
and in like manner, as is said in the A,<br>\
صَارُوا أَحَادِيثَ: there said to be tropical]. (IB,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the حَدِيث of the Apostle of<br>\
God: (Msb:) [i. e.] حَدِيثٌ also signifies A<br>\
narration of a مُحَدِّث: (L:) [meaning حَدِيثٌ<br>\
نَبَوِىٌّ, i. e. a tradition, or narration, relating,<br>\
or describing, a saying or an action &amp;c. of Mo-<br>\
hammad:] this word and خَبَرٌ both signify a<br>\
tradition that is traced up to Mohammad, or<br>\
to a Sahábee, or to a Tábi&#39;ee: (TA in art. رقأ:)<br>\
or حديث is applied to what comes from the<br>\
Prophet: خَبَرٌ, to what comes from another than<br>\
the Prophet; or from him or another: and أَثَرٌ<br>\
to what comes from a Companion of the Prophet;<br>\
but it may also be applied to a saying of the<br>\
Prophet: (Kull p. 152:) the word in this sense,<br>\
i. e. the حديث of the Prophet, has for its pl.<br>\
only أَحَادِيثُ; and therefore Sb mentions it in<br>\
the category of those words which have pls.<br>\
anomalously formed; such as عَرُوضٌ, pl. أَعَارِيضُ;<br>\
and بَاطِلٌ, pl. أَبَاطِيلُ. (TA.) [الحَدِيثَ written<br>\
at the end of a quotation of a part of a trad. is for<br>\
اِقْرَأِ الحَدِيثَ Read the tradition.] ―<br>\
-b3-  حَدِيثٌ قُدْسِىٌّ<br>\
[A holy tradition or narration] means what<br>\
God has told to his prophet by inspiration, or<br>\
by a dream, or in sleep, and the prophet has<br>\
told in his own phraseology: the Kur-án is<br>\
esteemed above this, because [it is held that]<br>\
its words also were revealed: (KT:) that of<br>\
which the words are from the apostle, but the<br>\
meaning is from God, by inspiration, or by a<br>\
dream, or in sleep. (Kull p. 288.)<br>\
