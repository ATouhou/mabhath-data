load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'حمصحِمَّصٌ and حِمٍّصٌ; (S, Msb, K;) the former<br>\
preferred by Th, (S, TA,) and by the Koofees,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) and the only word of that form except قِنَّفٌ and قلَّفٌ and قِنِّبٌ and خِنَّبٌ; (Fr,<br>\
TA;) the latter alone allowed by Mbr, (S,) and<br>\
this alone mentioned by Sb, (TA,) and preferred<br>\
by the Basrees, (Msb, TA,) and said by Mbr to<br>\
be the only word of this form except حِلِّزٌ, meaning “ short,” and جِلِّقٌ, the name of a place in<br>\
Syria, (S, TA,) but IAar did not know this latter<br>\
form of the word; (Az, TA;) [The cicer arietinum; or chick-peas;] a certain grain, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) well known, (Msb, K,) of the description<br>\
termed القَطَانِ: (AHn:) n. un. حِمَّصَةٌ and<br>\
حِمِّصَةٌ: (TA:) it is white, and red, and black,<br>\
and of a sort called كِرْسِنِىٌّ [or كَرْسَنِىٌّ?]; and<br>\
is also wild, and cultivated in gardens: the wild<br>\
sort is the hotter, and the more contracted; the<br>\
nutriment of the garden-sort is the better; and<br>\
the black is the most powerful in its operations:<br>\
(the Minháj, TA:) it is flatulent, lenitive, diuretic,<br>\
having the property of increasing the seminal<br>\
fluid and the carnal appetite and the blood:<br>\
(K:) Hippocrates says that it has in it two substances, which quit it by cooking; one of them<br>\
salt, or saline, which is lenitive; and the other<br>\
sweet, which is diuretic; and it clears away spots<br>\
in the skin, and beautifies the complexion, and is<br>\
beneficial for hot tumours, and its oil is serviceable for the ringworm, or tetter; and its meal,<br>\
for the fluid of foul ulcers; and the infusion<br>\
thereof, for toothache, and for swelling of the lip;<br>\
and it clears the voice: (TA:) it also strengthens<br>\
the body and the penis; (K;) wherefore it is<br>\
given as fodder to the stallions of horses and the<br>\
like, and of camels; (TA;) on the condition of<br>\
its being eaten not before [other] food nor after<br>\
it, but in the midst thereof; (K;) or, correctly,<br>\
as in the Minháj, it should be eaten between two<br>\
meals. (TA.)<br>\
