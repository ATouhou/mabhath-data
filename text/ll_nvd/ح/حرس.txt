حَرُسَ (S, Msb,<br>\
TA) and<br>\
حَرِسَ (TA,) inf. n. حِرَاسَةٌ (S, Mgh, K)<br>\
and حَرْسٌ, (K,) or ↓ the former is a simple subst.,<br>\
(Msb,) and the latter is an inf. n. only on the<br>\
authority of analogy, though often used by [the<br>\
Hanafee Imám] Mohammad, (Mgh,) He guarded,<br>\
kept, preserved, or took care of, him or it: (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb:) [and so ↓ حارسهُ; or he guarded him,<br>\
being guarded by him: see 3 in art. ربأ.] You say,<br>\
حَرَسَهُ اللّٰهُ مِنَ البَلَآءِ [May God guard him from<br>\
trial, or affliction]: and أَدَامَ حِرَاسَتَهُ [May He continue the guarding of him]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  حَرَسَ, aor.<br>\
حَرِسَ,<br>\
(Msb, K,) inf. n. حَرْسٌ, (Msb,) (tropical:)  He stole;<br>\
(Msb, K;) [ironically used in this sense; see<br>\
حَارِسٌ;] as also ↓ احترس: (K:) or the latter, he<br>\
stole a sheep or goat by night: (S:) or both, he<br>\
stole camels and sheep or goats by night, and ate<br>\
them: (TA:) or the latter, he stole [a sheep or<br>\
the like] from the mountain: (El-Fárábee, Msb:)<br>\
or he took, (Sh, TA,) or stole, (TA,) a thing<br>\
from the place of pasturage. (Sh, TA.) You<br>\
say also, حَرَسَنِى شَاةً, (A, Mgh,) and ↓ أَحْرَسَنِى,<br>\
(A, TA,) [but the latter is perhaps a mistranscription for ↓ اِحْتَرَسَنِى,] (tropical:)  He stole from me a sheep<br>\
or goat. (Mgh.)<br>\

-A2-  and see حَرَسَ, in two places.<br>\
حَرَسٌ: see حَارِسٌ: for the former, in two places.<br>\
حَرَسِىٌّ: see حَارِسٌ: for the former, in two places.<br>\
حِرَاسَةٌ: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  فُلَانٌ يَأْكُلُ الحِرَاسَاتِ Such a<br>\
one eats stolen things: (A:) or steals the sheep<br>\
or goats of people, one after another, and eats of<br>\
them. (TA.)<br>\
حَرِيسَةٌ What is guarded, kept, preserved, or<br>\
taken care of. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  A thing stolen: (K:)<br>\
or a sheep, or goat, that is stolen by night: (S:)<br>\
of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ in the sense of the measure<br>\
مَفْعُولَةٌ: (TA:) hence, حَرِيسَةُ الجَبَلِ (S) a sheep,<br>\
or goat, that is overtaken by the night before its<br>\
return to its nightly resting-place, and is stolen<br>\
from the mountain: (Msb:) or a sheep, or<br>\
goat, that is stolen, of those that are guarded,<br>\
or kept, in the mountain: or, as some say, from<br>\
حَارِسٌ applied ironically to a thief: (Mgh:) pl.<br>\
حَرَائِسُ (S, K.) Hence the saying, (TA,) لَا قَطْعَ<br>\
فِى حَرِيسَةِ الجَبَلِ (tropical:)  [There shall be no amputation<br>\
of the hand for the sheep, or goat, that is stolen<br>\
by night from the mountain]. (A, TA.) IF says<br>\
that there are two explanations of the expression<br>\
حريسة الجبل: some make it to signify theft, or<br>\
the thing stolen, (السَّرِقَةُ,) itself: others make the<br>\
meaning to be, that there shall be no amputation<br>\
for [stealing] what is guarded, or kept, in the<br>\
mountain, because it is not a place well protected: ISk says that الحَرِيسَةُ signifies السَّرِقَةُ.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A wall of stones, made for sheep, or<br>\
goats, (K,) to guard them. (TA.)<br>\
حَارِسٌ Guarding, keeping, or preserving; a<br>\
guardian, or keeper: (S, Mgh, Msb:) pl. ↓ حَرَسٌ<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K) [or this is rather a quasi-pl. n.]<br>\
and حُرَّاسٌ (Msb, K) and [pl. of pauc.] أَحْرَاسٌ.<br>\
(K.) ↓ حَرَسٌ also signifies The guards of a<br>\
Sultán; (S, * Msb, K TA;) and so حُرَّاسٌ: (S,<br>\
K:) the former is thus used as a gen. n.: (S,<br>\
Msb:) and the n. un. is ↓ حَرَسِىٌّ: (S, Msb, K:)<br>\
you do not say حَارِسٌ unless you mean to denote<br>\
thereby the signification of guarding, or keeping,<br>\
without the quality of a gen. n. (S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also (tropical:)  A thief; used in this sense ironically; (A,<br>\
Mgh, TA;) because they found guardians to be<br>\
thieves; (A, TA;) and so ↓ مُحْتَرِسٌ: (TA:)<br>\
pl. of the former, حُرَّاسٌ. (A.)<br>\
مُحْتَرَسٌ [pass. part. n. of 8]. You say, مُحْتَرَسٌ<br>\
مِنْ مِثْلِهِ وَهْوَ حَارِسٌ [From such as he does one<br>\
guard himself, whereas he is a guardian]: a<br>\
prov.: (S, K:) alluding to him who finds fault<br>\
with a bad man when he is himself worse than<br>\
he: (K:) or to him who is intrusted with the<br>\
guarding of a thing when one is not secure<br>\
from his being unfaithful with respect to it.<br>\
(TA.) [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov., ii. 706.]<br>\
مُحْتَرِسٌ: see حَارِسٌ, last signification.<br>\
