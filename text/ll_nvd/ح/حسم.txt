حَسَمَهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor<br>\
حَسِمَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
حَسْمٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) He cut it; or cut it off:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) he cut it off entirely. (Mgh, Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, حَسْمُ العَرْقِ: (S:) you say, حَسَمَ العِرْقَ,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) He cut the vein, and<br>\
then cauterized it to prevent the flow of the blood:<br>\
(K:) or this is an elliptical expression, originally<br>\
حَسَمَ دَمَ العِرْقِ, meaning he stopped the flow of<br>\
blood from the vein by cauterization. (Msb.)<br>\
And hence, (Mgh,) اِقْطَعُوهُ ثُمَّ احْسِمُوهُ, (S, Mgh,)<br>\
or اِقْطَعُوا يَدَهُ ثُمَّ اكْوُوهَا [Cut ye off his hand,<br>\
then cauterize it], (S, * Mgh, * TA,) in order that<br>\
the blood may stop. (S, Mgh, TA.) You say<br>\
also, حَسَمْتُ الدَّابَّةَ, meaning I cauterized the beast<br>\
by successive operations. (Bd in lxix. 7.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,<br>\
also,] حَسَمَ الدَّآءَ, (K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,)<br>\
He stopped the disease by a remedy. (K.) And<br>\
حَسَمَتْهُ أُمُّهُ الرِّضَاعَ, and الغِذَآءَ, His mother stopped<br>\
his sucking, and his food: (TA:) and حُسِمَ رِضَاعُهُ<br>\
[His sucking was stopped]; (K;) said of a child.<br>\
(TA.) And حَسَمَ فُلَانًا الشَّىْءَ, (K,) inf. n. as<br>\
above, (TA,) He prevented such a one from attaining the thing. (K.) And أَنَا أَحْسِمُ عَلَى فُلَانٍ<br>\
الأَمْرَ I cut off from him the thing, so that he<br>\
cannot attain aught thereof. (TA.) See also<br>\
حُسُومٌ, below. ―<br>\
-b4-  You say also, حَسَمَهُمْ, aor<br>\
حَسِمَ,<br>\
inf. n. حُسُومٌ, It caused them to pass away, come<br>\
to an end, cease, perish, or come to nought. (Zj,<br>\
TA.) See, again, حُسُومٌ, below.<br>\
-A2-  حَسَمَ فِى<br>\
العَمَلِ, (TK,) inf. n. حُسُومٌ, (Yoo, K,) He strove,<br>\
laboured, toiled, or exerted himself, and wearied<br>\
himself, in work. (Yoo, K, TK.)<br>\
7<br>\
انحسم It was, or became, cut, or cut off:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) [or it was, or became, cut off entirely: see 1, of which it is the quasi-pass.]<br>\
حُسُامٌ A sword; because it cuts that upon which<br>\
it comes: (Msb:) or a sharp sword; (S, K, TA;)<br>\
and in the same sense applied to a [knife such as<br>\
is termed] مُدْيَة: (TA:) and (so in the S, but in<br>\
the K “ or ”) the edge of a sword, with which one<br>\
strikes. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  لَيْلَةٌ حُسَامٌ A lasting night:<br>\
(K:) or a night of lasting evil, especially. (TA.)<br>\
حُسُومٌ Unluckiness, or inauspiciousness. (S, *<br>\
K, * TA.) Some explain it thus in the passage<br>\
here following. (S, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سَخَّرَهَا عَلَيْهِمْ سَبْعَ<br>\
لَيَالِ وَ ثَمَانِيَةَ أَيَّامٍ حُسُومًا, in the Kur lxix. 7, means<br>\
He sent it (the wind) upon them by force, (Jel,)<br>\
or made it to prevail against them by his power,<br>\
(Bd,) [seven nights and eight days] consecutively;<br>\
(T, S, Bd, K, Jel;) an expression taken from the<br>\
repetition of the act of cauterization, (T, Bd, Jel.)<br>\
i. e. the act of the ↓ حَاسِم; (Jel;) whence this<br>\
word (حاسم) is applied to anything made consecutive; (T, TA;) and حُسُومٌ is its pl.: (T, Bd,<br>\
TA:) or حُسُومٌ signifies the making consecutive.<br>\
and, as an epithet, consecutive, and continuous<br>\
from first to last: (Fr, TA:) or, accord. to some,<br>\
الأَيَّامُ الحُسُومٌ means the days that are consecutive<br>\
with evil especially; and such ISd thinks to be<br>\
the meaning: (TA:) or اللَّيَالِى الحُسُومُ means<br>\
the nights that cut off good, or prosperity, (↓ تَحّسِمُ<br>\
الخَيْرَ,) from their people: (S, * K: [and the like<br>\
is said by Bd in lxix. 7:]) or حُسُومًا in the Kur<br>\
means causing them to pass away, come to an<br>\
end, cease, perish, or come to nought: (Zj, T:)<br>\
or it may be an inf. n., meaning for the purpose<br>\
of cutting off: or an inf. n. of a verb meant to be<br>\
understood, as a denotative of state; i. e. ↓ تَحْسِمُهُمْ<br>\
حُسُومًا [agreeably with the explanation of Zj];<br>\
and this is confirmed by the reading with fet-h<br>\
[i. e. حَسُومًا, though this is a very rare form of<br>\
inf. n.]: (Bd:) you say أَيَّامٌ حُسُومٌ, (K,) in which<br>\
case the latter word is an inf. n. used as an epithet,<br>\
meaning cutting off, or preventing, good, or prosperity; (TA;) and أَيَّامُ حُسُومٍ, which has a similar<br>\
meaning. (K, TA.)<br>\
حَاسِمٌ; pl. حُسُومٌ: see this latter word.<br>\
مَحْسَمَةٌ A cause, or means, of cutting off, or<br>\
stopping; (T, K, TA;) syn. مَقْطَعَةٌ. (T, TA.)<br>\
So in the saying, هٰذَا مَحْسَمَةٌ لِلدَّآءِ This is a cause,<br>\
or means, of cutting off, or stopping, the disease.<br>\
(K, * TA.) And hence, (TA,) عَلَيْكُمْ بِالصَّوْمِ فَإِنَّهُ<br>\
مَحْسَمَةٌ لِلْعِرْقِ وَ مَذْهَبَةٌ لِلْأَشَرِ, a trad., (T, S, TA,)<br>\
meaning [Keep ye to fasting, for it is] a cause,<br>\
or means, of stopping venereal intercourse, [and a<br>\
cause, or means, of dispelling exultation, or excessive exultation, and resting the mind upon<br>\
things agreeable with natural desire:] (TA:) or<br>\
an impediment to venery, and a cause of diminishing the seminal fluid, and of stopping venereal<br>\
intercourse or passion, &amp;c. (T, TA.)<br>\
مَحْسُومٌ A child (TA) whose sucking is stopped:<br>\
(K, TA:) and whose food is stopped. (TA.) And<br>\
A child badly fed. (S, K.) Hence the prov.,<br>\
وَلْغُ جُرَىٍّ كَانَ مَحْسُومًا [The lapping of a little<br>\
puppy that had been badly fed]: said on the<br>\
occasion of a greedy person&#39;s taking much of a<br>\
thing that he had not been able to obtain, and<br>\
that he had became able to obtain; or in ordering<br>\
one to take much when able. (TA. [See Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Arab. Prov. ii. 817; where another reading is<br>\
given, namely, مَحْشُومًا in the place of مَحْسُومًا,<br>\
as well as the reading here given.])<br>\
