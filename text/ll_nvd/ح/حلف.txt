حَلَفَ, aor.<br>\
حَلِفَ, inf. n. حَلِفٌ and حَلْفٌ (S,<br>\
Msb, K) and حِلْفٌ (K) and مَحْلُوفٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
like مَجْلُودٌ and مَعْقُولٌ and مَعْسُورٌ, (S,) and<br>\
مَحْلُوفَةٌ (Lth, K) [and مَحْلُوفَآءُ, like مَشْعُورَآءُ, as<br>\
will be seen from what follows], He swore. (S.)<br>\
You say, حَلَبَ بِاللّٰهِ [He swore by God]. (Msb.)<br>\
[And حَلَفَ إِنّهُ كَذَا He swore it was so. And<br>\
حَلَفَ لَهُ عَلَى كَذَا He swore to him to do such a<br>\
thing.] And حَلَفَ يَمِينًا (T in art. ثنى, &amp;c.) and<br>\
عَلَى يَمِينٍ (El-Jámi&#39; es Sagheer voce مَنْ, &amp;c.)<br>\
[He swore an oath]. And لَا وَمَحْلُوفَائِهِ لَا أَفْعَلُ<br>\
[No, by the swearing it, (meaning no, I swear<br>\
it,) I will not do such a thing]. (Ibn-Buzurj, K. *)<br>\
And مَحْلُوفَةً بِاللّٰهِ, meaning أَحْلِفُ مَحْلُوفَةً, i. e.<br>\
[I swear] an oath [by God]. (Lth, K.) Accord.<br>\
to IAth, the primary signification of حَلِفٌ is The<br>\
act of confederating, or making a compact or confederacy, to aid, or assist; and making an agreement: [but this meaning is afterwards said in the<br>\
TA to be tropical:] when the object of this, in<br>\
the time of paganism, was to aid in sedition or the<br>\
like, and in fighting, and incursions into the territories of enemies, it was forbidden by Mohammad: when the object was to aid the wronged,<br>\
and for making close the ties of relationship, and<br>\
the like, he confirmed it. (TA.)<br>\

(tropical:)  He united with him in a confederacy, league,<br>\

to do, such a thing.] ―<br>\

clung, kept, or held fast, to it: (K, TA:) see a<br>\
verse of Aboo-Dhu-eyb in art. خلف, voce خَالَفَ.<br>\
(TA.) You say, حالف بَثَّهُ, and حُزْنَهُ, (tropical:)  He clave<br>\
to his grief, or sorrow. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  مُحَالَفَةٌ also<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  The establishing a brotherhood. (TA.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., حَالَفَ بَيْنَ قُرَيْشٍ وَالأَنْصَارِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He established a brotherhood between Kureysh<br>\
and the Assistants. (S, TA.)<br>\

احلفهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِحْلَافٌ; (Msb;)<br>\
and ↓ حلّفهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَحْلِيفٌ; (Msb,<br>\
K;) and ↓ استحلفهُ; all signify the same; (S,<br>\
Msb, K;) [He made him to swear: and ↓ the<br>\
last, he asked him, or required him, to swear:<br>\
and he conjured him, or adjured him; as is shown<br>\
in the M in art. بلو; (see 8 in that art. in the<br>\
present work;) and so ↓ the second; as is shown<br>\

in the K and TA:) said [for instance] of a judge.<br>\
(TA.) You say, بِاللّٰهِ مَا فَعَلَ ↓ استحلفهُ and ↓ حلّفهُ<br>\

not, or had not done, such a thing]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] أَحْلَفَ الغُلَامُ The boy passed the time<br>\
when he had nearly attained to puberty: (K:)<br>\
so says Lth; adding that some say, قَدْ أُحْلِفَ:<br>\
and this Z mentions also, and he adds, so that it<br>\
was doubted whether he had attained to puberty:<br>\
but Az says that أَحْلَفَ الغُلَامُ in this sense is a<br>\
mistake; and that it means only he nearly attained to puberty; so that those who looked at<br>\
him differed in opinion; one saying and swearing<br>\
that he had attained to puberty, and another saying and swearing the contrary. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
أَحْلَفَتِ الحَلْفَآءُ The حلفاء attained to maturity.<br>\
(IAar, K.) [By الحلفاء would seem to be here<br>\
meant the clamorous female slave: for when this<br>\
word means a kind of grass, the ا is not that which<br>\
denotes the fem. gender, but is a letter of quasicoordination, if its n. of un. be حَلْفَآءَةٌ, as in the<br>\
Msb: but accord. to Sb, it is in this sense sing.<br>\
and pl.; and as pl., it is fem.; and in a description<br>\
of it by Aboo-Ziyád, cited by AHn, it is made<br>\
fem.]<br>\
6<br>\
تحالفوا عَلَى كَذَا They swore, one to another,<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  Friendship; or true, or sincere, friendship.<br>\

or a friend, or sincere friend, who swears to his<br>\
companion that he will not act unfaithfully with<br>\
him: (K:) or a friend, or true friend, is thus<br>\
called because he so swears; as also ↓ حَلِيفٌ:<br>\
(TA:) pl. of the former أَحْلَافٌ; (S, * K;) and of<br>\
the latter حُلَفَآءُ. (TA.) By the احلاف are meant,<br>\
in a poem of Zuheyr, Asad and Ghatafán; because<br>\
they united in a confederacy to aid each other;<br>\
and the same appellation is applied to a party of<br>\
Thakeef; (S, K;) and to six tribes of Kureysh,<br>\
namely, &#39;Abd-ed-Dár, Kaab, Jumah, Sahm,<br>\
Makhzoom, and &#39;Adee: (K:) and ↓ الحَلِيفَانِ<br>\
to Benoo-Asad and Teiyi, (S, O, K,) or Asad<br>\
and Ghatafán; (ISd, TA;) and Fezárah and<br>\
Asad also (S, K) are termed حَلِيفَانِ. (S.)<br>\
حَلَفٌ: see حَلْفَآء.<br>\
حَلْفَةٌ An oath. (Msb, TA. *) You say, حَلَفَ<br>\
حَلْفَةً, (TA,) and ↓ مَحْلُوفَةً, i. e. He swore an<br>\
oath; (Lth, K;) and ↓ حَلَفَ أُحْلُوفَةً [which<br>\
means the same]: (Lh, TA:) this last word is<br>\
of the measure أُفْعُولَة from الحَلِفُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also حِلْفٌ.<br>\
حَلَفَةٌ: see حَلْفَآء.<br>\
حَلِفَةٌ: see حَلْفَآء. ―<br>\

↓ محلفة [app. مَحْلَفَةٌ]: (TA:) or producing<br>\
حلفاء. (AHn, TA.)<br>\
حَلْفَآء [app. حَلْفَآءٌ accord. to some, and حَلْفَآءٌ<br>\
accord. to others, (in the CK, erroneously, حُلَفاء,)],<br>\
(S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) in measure like حَمْرَآء,<br>\
[and if so, حَلْفَآءُ, but see what follows,] (Msb,)<br>\
and ↓ حَلَفٌ, (Akh, K,) [A kind of high, coarse<br>\

and poa cynosuroïdes;] a certain plant, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) [growing] in water, (S,) well known, (Msb,)<br>\
of those termed أَغْلَاث: (TA:) Aboo-Ziyád says<br>\
of the حلفاء that it seldom grows anywhere but<br>\
near to water or to the bottom of a valley; and<br>\
is long, or tall, (سلبة,) rough to the touch; seldom,<br>\
or never, does any one lay hold upon it, for fear<br>\
of his hand being cut; sometimes camels and<br>\
sheep or goats eat a little of it; and it is much<br>\
liked by oxen: (AHn, TA:) [a coll. gen. n.:]<br>\
n. un. ↓ حَلَفَةٌ, (S, K,) accord. to AZ, (S,) or<br>\
Aboo-Ziyád, and AHn, (TA,) and ↓ حَلِفَةٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
accord. to As, (S,) and حَلْفَآءَةٌ, (Msb, K,) like<br>\
صَحْرَآءَةٌ: (K: [in the CK like صَحْرَةٌ, and omitted<br>\
in my copy of the TA:]) [this last n. un. requires<br>\
that the coll. gen. n. should be حَلْفَآءٌ: (see 4,<br>\
last sentence:) but] Sb says that حلفاء is sing.<br>\
and pl.: [see شَجَرٌ:] (TA:) [as pl., it is fem.;<br>\
and it is made fem. in the description by Aboo-Ziyád, cited above:] sometimes it has حَلَافِىُّ for<br>\
pl.: and its dim. is ↓ حُلَيْفَيَّةٌ. (O, TA.) أَنَا الَّذِي<br>\
فِى الحَلْفَآءِ, occurring in a trad., means (assumed tropical:)  I am<br>\
the lion; because that beast repairs to the places<br>\
where the حلفاء grows: and [hence,] كَأَنَّهُ أَخُو<br>\
الحَلْفَآءِ means (assumed tropical:)  As though he were the lion.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  حَلْفَآءُ also signifies A clamorous female<br>\

حَلِيفٌ: see حِلْفٌ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  Whatever cleaves, clings, keeps, or holds fast, to another<br>\
thing, is termed its حَلِيف: whence one says,<br>\

-b3-  حَلِيفُ اللِّسَانِ<br>\
(tropical:)  Sharp-tongued; (S, Z, K;) chaste, or eloquent,<br>\
in speech; (S;) who conforms to the desire of<br>\
his companion, as though he were a confederate.<br>\
(Z, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  حَلِيفُ الغَرْبِ, in a poem of Sa&#39;ideh<br>\
Ibn-Ju-eiyeh, (Skr, K, * TA,) means (tropical:)  A sharp<br>\
spear-head, (K,) or a spear with a sharp head:<br>\
(Skr, TA:) or it means a brisk, lively, or sprightly,<br>\
horse. (Skr, K.) Az says, سِنَانٌ حَلِيفٌ means<br>\
(tropical:)  A sharp spear-head: and I think that it is<br>\
termed حليف because the sharpness of its point<br>\
is likened to the sharpness of the points of [the<br>\
grass called] حَلْفَآء. (TA.)<br>\
حَلَافَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  Sharpness, in anything. (TA.)<br>\
وَادٍ حُلَافِىٌّ A valley that produces [the grass<br>\
called] حَلْفَآء. (Sgh, K.)<br>\
حُلَيْفِيَّةٌ: see حَلْفَآء.<br>\
حَلَّافٌ and حَلَّافَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
حَالِفٌ [Swearing:] and ↓ حَلَّافٌ that swears<br>\
much, or often; and so ↓ حَلَّافَةٌ [but in a more<br>\
intensive sense]. (TA.)<br>\
مَا أَحْلَفَ لِسَانَهُ (tropical:)  How sharp-tongued is he,<br>\
(K, * TA,) and how chaste, or eloquent, in speech!<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
أُحْلُوفَةٌ: see حِلْفَةٌ.<br>\
مُحْلِفٌ (tropical:)  Anything respecting which one doubts,<br>\
so that people swear respecting it; (ISd, L, K,<br>\
TA;) so called because it occasions swearing:<br>\
(ISd, TA:) such is also termed مُحْنِثٌ. (L.)<br>\
[Hence,] (tropical:)  A boy of whom one doubts whether he<br>\
have attained to puberty. (IAar, TA.) [And<br>\
hence] it is said, حَضَارِ وَالوَزْنُ مُحْلَفَانِ (tropical:)  [Hadári<br>\
and El-Wezn are two causes of swearing]: these<br>\
are two stars: the reason of the saying is that<br>\
which is explained in art. حضر, voce حَضَارِ.<br>\
(S, K.) Hence, also, كُمَيْتٌ مُحْلِفَةٌ, (S,) or<br>\
كميت مُحْلِفٌ, (K,) i. e. (tropical:)  [A bay] not of a clear<br>\
hue; (S, TA;) between that termed أَحْوَى and<br>\
that termed أَحَمُّ: accord. to the K, of a clear<br>\
hue; but this is the meaning of غَيْرُ مُحْلِفٍ.<br>\
(TA.) A poet says, (S,) namely Hubeyreh Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abd-Menáf El-Yarboo&#39;ee, also called, after his<br>\
mother, Ibn-El-Kelhabeh, (IB,)<br>\
كُمَيْتٌ غَيْرُ مُحْلِفَةٍ وَلٰكِنْ<br>\
كَلَوْنِ الصِّرْفِ عُلَّ بِهِ الأَدِيمُ<br>\
[A bay not of a dubious hue, but like the colour<br>\
of the صرف (q. v.) with which the hide is dyed a<br>\
second time]; i. e., of a clear hue, so that one<br>\
does not swear that she is otherwise than such:<br>\
(S, L:) accord. to IAar, not requiring her owner<br>\
to swear that he has seen her like in generousness:<br>\
but the former is the right meaning. (L.) Also<br>\
نَاقَةٌ مُحْلِفَةٌ (tropical:)  A she-camel respecting the fatness of<br>\
which one doubts. (TA.)<br>\
