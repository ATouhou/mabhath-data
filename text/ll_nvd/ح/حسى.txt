-A2-  حَسِيتُ الخَبَرَ i. q.<br>\
حَسِسْتُ [i. e. I knew the news certainly; or knew<br>\
somewhat of the news; see 4 in art. حس]; as<br>\
also الخَبَرَ ↓ أَحْسَيْتُ. (S, TA.) And حَسِىَ مَا فِى<br>\
نَفْسِهِ He knew what was in his mind; as also<br>\
↓ احتساهُ. (K.) One says also, مِنْ ↓ هَلِ احْتَسَيْتَ<br>\
فُلَانٍ شَيْئًا, meaning Hast thou found, or discovered, [or learned,] anything from such a one?<br>\
(Az, TA.)<br>\

8<br>\
احتسى He dug out the sand from a حِسْى<br>\
to procure the water beneath: (S:) he dug out<br>\
the earth for the water to come forth: (TA:)<br>\
and احتسى حِسْيًا (T, K) he fetched out, by digging,<br>\
the water of a حِسْى; so as heard by Az from<br>\
more than one of Benoo-Temeem: (TA:) or he<br>\
dug a حِسْى; as also ↓ حَسَاهُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He asked, or sought, information, news, or<br>\
tidings. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 1, in two places.<br>\
حَسْىٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
حِسْىٌ (T, S, K) and ↓ حِسًى (Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà,<br>\
AAF, K) and ↓ حَسْىٌ, accord. to the K, but this<br>\
is unknown, and the correct word is حَسًا, [or<br>\
rather ↓ حَسًى,] mentioned by IAar, (TA,) Water<br>\
which the earth imbibes from sand [above it],<br>\
and which, when it reaches what is hard, is<br>\
arrested thereby: one digs out the sand from over<br>\
it, and draws it forth: (S:) or accumulated sand,<br>\
beneath which is hard rock, so that, when the<br>\
sand is rained upon, it imbibes the water of the<br>\
rain, which, reaching the rock beneath, is arrested<br>\
thereby, and the sand prevents the heat of the<br>\
sun from drying up the water; wherefore, when<br>\
the heat is vehement, the upper portion of the<br>\
sand is dug out from over the water, and it wells<br>\
forth, cold and sweet, and is taken by little and<br>\
little: (Az, TA:) or soft, or plain, ground, in<br>\
which water remains and collects: or rugged<br>\
ground, over which is sand, that collects the rainwater; so that whenever a bucketful is drawn forth,<br>\
another collects: (K, TA:) so in the M: (TA:)<br>\
pl. [of pauc.] أَحْسَآءٌ (S, K) and [of mult.] حِسَآءٌ:<br>\
(K:) أَحْسَآءٌ is syn. with كِرَارٌ. (S.) [See also<br>\
حَشْرَجٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  حِسْىٌ also signifies A small quantity<br>\
of water; and so ↓ حَسَآءٌ. (Th, TA.)<br>\
