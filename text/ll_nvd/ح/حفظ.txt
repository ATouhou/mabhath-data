حَفِظَهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
حَفَظَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. حِفْظُ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) He kept it, preserved it, guarded it, protected it, or took care of<br>\
it; (S, K;) namely, a thing; (S;) he prevented<br>\
it from perishing, or becoming lost; (Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
namely, a thing, (Mgh,) or property &amp;c.; (Msb;)<br>\
and hence the saying, (Mgh,) حِفْظٌ is the contr.<br>\
of نِسْيَانٌ; (M, Mgh;) i. e., it signifies the taking<br>\
care, being careful; (M;) being mind ful, regardful, attentive, or considerate: (M, K:) [see also<br>\
5:] and بِهِ ↓ احتفظ signifies the same as حَفِظَهُ.<br>\
(S, Msb.) [Hence,] you say, حَفِظَ المَالَ He kept<br>\
and tended, or pastured and defended, the camels<br>\
or the like. (K.) [And حَفِظَ حُرْمَةَ صَاحِبِهِ He<br>\
was regardful of everything entitled to reverence,<br>\
respect, honour, or defence, in the character and<br>\
appertenances of his companion, or friend.] And<br>\
حَفِظَ السِّرَّ He kept the secret. (TA.) [And<br>\
حَفِظَ يَمِينَهُ He kept his oath: but this has also<br>\
another meaning, as will be seen below.] And<br>\
حَفِظَ القُرْآنَ He kept, or retained, the Kur-án in<br>\
his mind, or memory; got it, knew it, or learned<br>\
it, by heart. (S, * Msb, K.) [See also 5.] And<br>\
حَفِظَ عِنْ فُلَانٍ [He learned by heart from such a<br>\
one: and, followed by an accus. case, the same;<br>\
or he retained in his memory, as learned, or heard,<br>\
from such a one; or he remembered to have heard<br>\
from such a one]. (TA &amp;c. passim.) And one<br>\
says of God, قَدْ حَفِظَ عَلَى خَلْقِهِ وَعِبَادِهِ مَا يَعْمَلُونَ<br>\
مِنْ خَيْرٍ أَوْ شَرٍّ [He hath preserved from oblivion,<br>\
for, or against, his creatures and his servants,<br>\
what they do of good or evil]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
He kept it from being used, or employed, on, or<br>\
for, ordinary, mean, or vile, occasions, or purposes. (Mgh, Msb.) You say, فُلَانٌ يَحْفَظُ نَفْسَهُ<br>\
وَلِسَانَهُ Such a one keeps himself and his tongue<br>\
from ordinary, mean, or vile, employment, in<br>\
that which does not concern him. (Mgh.) And<br>\
hence the saying in the Kur [v. 91], وَاحْفَظُوا<br>\
أَيْمَانَكُمْ, accord. to one of the modes of interpreting<br>\
it; i. e. And keep ye your oaths from being used,<br>\
or uttered, on, or for, ordinary, mean, or vile,<br>\
occasions, or purposes; agreeably with what is<br>\
said in ii. 224 of the Kur, where ordinary and<br>\
frequent swearing by God is forbidden. (Mgh.)<br>\
[Another meaning of which this phrase is susceptible has been shown above.]<br>\

حَفَّظْتُهُ الكِتَابَ I incited him, or urged him,<br>\
[or made him,] to commit to memory, or learn<br>\

الحَدِيثَ ↓ أَحْفَظْتُهُ I made him to retain the<br>\

things, that are sacred, or inviolable, or that one<br>\

defended his wife, or wives, or the like. (TK.)<br>\
[And hence,] you say, إِنَّهُ لَذُو حِفَاظٍ, and ذُو<br>\

(TA.) You say, حافظ عَلَى الأَمْرِ, (TA,) or<br>\
على الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. محافظة, (Msb,) He kept,<br>\
attended, or applied himself, constantly, &amp;c., to<br>\
the thing, or affair. (TA.) And hence the saying in the Kur [ii. 239], حَافِظُوا عَلَى الصَّلَوَاتِ<br>\
Perform ye the prayers in their proper times:<br>\
or, accord. to Az, keep ye, attend ye, or apply<br>\
yourselves, constantly, or perseveringly, to the<br>\
performance of the prayers in their proper times.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  حِفَاظٌ, is also explained as signifying<br>\

senses explained above, it is also trans.: you<br>\

(S,) [The acts of defending those whom one is<br>\

of all things;] He from whose preservation nothing<br>\
is excluded, (K, * TA,) not even a thing of the<br>\

oblivion, for, or against, his creatures and his<br>\
servants, what they do of good or evil; who preserves the heavens and the earth by his power,<br>\

-b2-<br>\
And مُحْفِظَاتُ رَجُلٍ A man&#39;s women and others<br>\
whom he protects, and for whose defence he fights<br>\
[when required to do so: because they occasion<br>\
his being angered when they are injured]. (TA.)<br>\
مَحْفُوظٌ Kept, preserved, guarded, or taken<br>\
care of, because of the high estimation in which<br>\
it is held; as also ↓ حَفِيظٌ. (TA.) It is said in<br>\
the Kur [lxxxv. 21 and 22], بَلْ هُوَ قُرْآنٌ مَجِيدٌ<br>\
فِى لَوْحٍ مَحْفُوظٍ (TA) [Nay, it is a glorious<br>\
Kur-án, written upon a tablet preserved] from<br>\
the devils and from the alteration of anything<br>\
thereof: (Jel:) or, accord. to one reading, مَحْفُوظٌ,<br>\
this epithet being thus made to relate to the<br>\
Kur-án. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, as an epithet in which<br>\
the quality of a subst. predominates, and then as<br>\
a subst.,] A young child; in the dial. of Mekkeh;<br>\
as a term of good omen: pl. مَحَافِيظُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\

which he kept, or retained, in his mind, or<br>\
memory, or which he knew, or had learned, by<br>\
heart, to such a one. (TA.)<br>\
