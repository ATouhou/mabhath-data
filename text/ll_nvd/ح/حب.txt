حَبَّ [signifying He, or it, was, or became,<br>\
loved, beloved, an object of love, affected, liked,<br>\
or approved, is originally حَبُبَ or حَبِبَ]. You<br>\
say, حَبَّ إِلَىَّ هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ, [aor.<br>\
حَبُ3َ or<br>\
حَبَ3َ,] inf. n.<br>\
حُبٌّ, This thing was, or became, an object of love<br>\
to me. (K. [The meaning is there indicated, but<br>\
not expressed. In the CK, الشَّىءَ is erroneously<br>\
put for الشَّىْءُ.]) And حَبُبْتُ إِلَيْهِ I became loved,<br>\
beloved, or an object of love, to him: [said to be]<br>\
the only instance of its kind except شَرُرْتُ and<br>\
لَبُبْتُ. (K.) And مَا كُنْتَ حَبِيبًا وَلَقَدْ حَبِبْتَ, with<br>\
kesr, Thou wast not loved, and thou hast become<br>\
loved. (S.) See also 5. ―<br>\
-b2-  حَبَّ, formed from<br>\
حَبُبَ, by making the former ب quiescent and incorporating it into the latter, is also a verb of<br>\
praise [signifying Beloved, lovely, pleasing, charming, or excellent, is he, or it]; (TA;) and so حُبَّ,<br>\
[which is more common,] formed from the same,<br>\
by incorporating the former ب into the latter<br>\
after transferring the dammeh of the former to the<br>\
ح. (ISk, S, TA.) A poet says,<br>\
وَزَادَهُ كَلَفًا فِى الحُبِّ أَنْ مَنَعَتْ<br>\
وَحَبَّ شَيْئًا الَى الانْسَانِ مَا مُنِعَا<br>\
[And her denying increased his devotion in love:<br>\
for lovely, as a thing, to man, is that which is<br>\
denied]. (TA.) And Sá&#39;ideh says,<br>\
هَجَرَتْ غَضُوبُ وَحَبَّ مَنْ يَتَجَنَّبُ<br>\
وَعَدَتْ عَوَادٍ دُونَ وَلْيِكَ تَشْعِبُ<br>\
[Ghadoob hath forsaken thee, (and lovely is the<br>\
person who withdraweth far away,) and obstacles<br>\
in the way of thy drawing near have occurred to<br>\
separate thee and her]. (S, TA.) [See also حَبَّذَا,<br>\
below.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [Both are also verbs of wonder.] You<br>\
say, حَبَّ بِفُلَانٍ, (As, S, and so in copies of the<br>\
K,) and حُبَّ, (I &#39;Ak p. 236, [where both forms<br>\
are mentioned as correct,] and so in the CK,)<br>\
How beloved, or lovely, &amp;c., is such a one (As,<br>\
S, K) to me! (As, S.) [See also 4.] A&#39;Obeyd<br>\
and Fr read this حَبَّ, saying that it means حَبُبَ<br>\
بفلان, and that the former ب is rendered quiescent by the suppression of its dammeh, and incorporated into the latter. (S, * TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
4, in two places.<br>\
-A3-  Also حَبَّ, [aor., accord. to<br>\
analogy,<br>\
حَبِ3َ,] He stood still, stopped, or paused.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
-A4-  And حُبَّ, with damm, He was fatigued,<br>\
or tired. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
حبّبهُ إِلَىَّ He, or it, [rendered him, or it,<br>\
an object of love, lovely, or pleasant, to me;]<br>\
made me to love, affect, like, approve, or take<br>\
pleasure in, him, or it. (K.) You say, حبّبهُ إِلَىَّ<br>\
إِحْسَانُهُ [His beneficence made him an object of<br>\
love to me]. (A, TA.) And حَبَّبَ اللّٰهُ إِلَيْهِ الإِيمَانَ<br>\
[God made faith lovely to him]. (A, TA.) And<br>\
حُبِّبَ إِلَىَّ بِأَنْ تَزُورَنِى [Thy visiting me hath been<br>\
made pleasant to me]. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  حبّب الدَّوَآءَ<br>\
[He formed the medicine into pills, or little clots<br>\
or balls: see its quasi-pass., 5]. (K in حثر, &amp;c.)<br>\
-A3-  And حبّب He filled a water-skin &amp;c. (AA,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A4-  See also 5.<br>\
3<br>\
مُحَابَّةٌ, (S,) or مُحَابَبَةٌ, (K,) and حِبَابٌ signify the same [as inf. ns. of حابّ]. (S, K.) [You<br>\
say, حابّ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا They loved, affected, liked,<br>\
approved, or took pleasure in, one another.] And<br>\
حابّهُ He acted, or behaved, in a loving, or friendly,<br>\
manner with him, or to him. (A, TA.) ―<br>\

احبّهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِحْبَابٌ; (KL;)<br>\
and ↓ حَبَّهُ, (S,) first pers. حَبَبْتُهُ, (Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
حَبِ3َ,<br>\
which is anomalous, (S, Msb, K,) the regular<br>\
aor. being<br>\
حَبُ3َ, which is unused, (Msb,) [said to<br>\
be] the only instance of a trans. verb whose<br>\
second and third radical letters are the same<br>\
having the measure يَفْعِلُ as that of its aor. without having also the measure يَفْعُلُ, (S,) and<br>\
therefore by some disapproved, as not chaste, and<br>\
disallowed by Az, though he allows the pass.<br>\
form حُبَّ, (TA,) inf. n. حُبٌّ, (K,) or this is a<br>\
simple subst., (Msb,) and حِبٌّ; (K;) and [↓ حَبَّهُ,]<br>\

حَبَ3َ; and ↓ حَابّهُ, inf. n. حِبَابٌ,<br>\
of the dial. of Hudheyl; (Msb;) and ↓ استحبّهُ;<br>\
(Msb, K;) signify the same; (S, Msb, K;) He<br>\
loved, affected, liked, approved, or took pleasure in,<br>\
him, or it: (A, K, and KL in explanation of the<br>\
first and last:) he held him, or esteemed him, as a<br>\
friend: (KL in explanation of the first and last:)<br>\
or اِسْتِحْبَابٌ signifies the esteeming [a person or<br>\
thing] good: (S:) and the preferring, or choosing,<br>\
[a person or thing,] as also إِحْبَابٌ: (KL:) and<br>\
استحبّهُ عَلَى غَيْرِهِ means he loved, or esteemed,<br>\
him, or it, above another, or others; preferred<br>\
him, or it, to another, or others. (K, A, * TA.)<br>\
مَا أَحَبْتُ ذٰلِكَ, in the dial. of the tribe of Suleym,<br>\
is for ما أَحْبَبْتُهُ [I loved not, or liked not, that];<br>\
like ظَنْتُ for ظَنَنْتُ, and ظَلْتُ and ظِلْتُ for<br>\
ظَلِلْتُ. (Lh, TA.) [أُحِبُّ أَنْ يَكوُنَ كَذَا may be<br>\
rendered I would that it were thus, or that such<br>\
a thing were.] It is said of Ohod, in a trad.,<br>\
هُوَ جَبَلٌ يُحِبُّنَا وَنُحِبُّهُ, meaning It is a mountain<br>\
whose inhabitants love us, and whose inhabitants we<br>\
love: or it may mean we love the mountain itself,<br>\
because it is in the land of people whom we love.<br>\
(IAth, TA.) And one says فِى سَاعَةٍ يُحِبُّهَا<br>\
الطَّعَامُ for يُحَبُّ فِيهَا [In an hour, or a time, in<br>\
which food is loved, or liked]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَا أَحَبَّهُ<br>\
إِلَىَّ i. q. حَبَّ بِهِ [How beloved, lovely, pleasing,<br>\
charming, or excellent, is he, or it, to me!]; (As,<br>\
S, K, * TA;) and so أَحْبِبْ إِلَىَّ بِهِ. (A, TA.) [De<br>\
Sacy, in his Gram. Ar., sec. ed., ii. 221, mentions<br>\
the saying, مَا أَحَبَّ المُؤْمِنَ للّٰهِ وَمَا أَحَبَّهُ إِلَى اللّٰهِ,<br>\
as meaning How greatly does the believer love<br>\
God! and how great an object of love is he to<br>\
God!]<br>\
-A2-  احبّ, (S, K,) inf. n. as above, (S,)<br>\
also signifies He (a camel) kneeled and lay down,<br>\

or kneeled and lay down: (S:) or was afflicted<br>\
by a fracture, or disease, and would not move<br>\
from his place until cured, or remained there<br>\
until he died: (AZ, S, K:) or became jaded:<br>\
(TA: [agreeably with this last explanation the<br>\
act. part. n. is rendered in the S and K on the<br>\
authority of Th:]) or was at the point of death,<br>\
by reason of violent disease, and therefore kneeled<br>\
and lay down, and could not be roused. (AHeyth,<br>\
TA.) Accord. to AO, أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الخَيْرِ عَنْ ذِكْرِ<br>\
رَبِّى [in the Kur xxxviii. 31] means I have stuck<br>\
to the ground, on account of my love of the horses,<br>\

prayer, until the time of prayer has passed:<br>\
(TA:) by الخير is meant الخَيْل. (Jel.)<br>\

تجبّب He manifested, or showed, love, or<br>\
affection, (S, K,) إِلَيْهِ to him. (S.) تحبّب and<br>\
↓ حَبَّ are both syn. with تُودّد. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also,<br>\
app., He became, or made himself, an object of<br>\
love or affection to him: see مُحَبَّبٌ, said to be<br>\
syn. with مُتَحَبِّبٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  He became swollen, or<br>\

TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He began to be satiated with drink.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He (an ass &amp;c.) became filled with<br>\

until they were satiated. (S.)<br>\
-A3-  تحبّب الجَلِيدُ<br>\

art. بحثر.) ―<br>\
-b4-  تحبّب الزُّبْدُ [The butter formed<br>\
into little clots, when first appearing in the milk<br>\

in art. حثر,) and دِبْس (S in that art.,) and<br>\
medicine. (TA in that art. [See also 2.]) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\

lengthened. (K.) This is at the conjunction of<br>\
[the periods of] الطَّرْف and الجَبْهَة [the ninth and<br>\
tenth of the Mansions of the Moon, which, in<br>\
central Arabia, about the commencement of the<br>\
era of the Flight, took place on the 12th of<br>\
August, O. S., (see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل,)]<br>\
when Canopus rises with them. (TA. [الصَّرْفَة is<br>\
there put for الطَّرْف; but evidently by a mistake<br>\
of a copyist. There is also another mistake,<br>\
though a small one, in the foregoing passage: for<br>\
Canopus rises, in central Arabia, after الطرف,<br>\
and before الجبهة; and rose aurorally, in that<br>\
latitude, about the commencement of the era of<br>\
the Flight, on the 4th of August, O. S.])<br>\

مِنْ عِنَبٍ, as well as مِنَ البُرِّ, and مِنَ الشَّعِيرِ, and<br>\
the like: (TA:) [and hence, to beads: (see<br>\
حِبٌّ:)] the pl. (of حَبٌّ, Msb) is حُبُوبٌ (S, Msb,<br>\
K) and حُبَّانٌ, like تُمْرَانٌ, (K,) pl. of تَمْرٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and (of حَبَّةٌ, Msb) حَبَّاتٌ (Msb, K) and حِبَابٌ,<br>\
[or this is pl. of حَبٌّ also,] like كِلَابٌ as pl. of<br>\
كَلْبَةٌ [and of كَلْبٌ]: (Msb:) and حَبٌّ is also<br>\
called [by lexicologists, but not by grammarians,]<br>\
a pl. of حَبَّةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] Seed-produce,<br>\
whether small or large. (TA.) ―<br>\

-b6-<br>\
[Hence likewise,] حَبٌّ also signifies Pimples, or<br>\

(K;) inclination of the nature, or natural disposition, towards a thing that pleases, or delights;<br>\
(Kull p. 165;) contr. of بُغْضٌ: (Mgh, TA:) حُبٌّ<br>\
and ↓ حِبٌّ and ↓ حُبَّةٌ [this being said in the S to<br>\
be syn. with حُبٌّ and in the K to be syn. with<br>\
مَحَبَّةٌ, and it is used as an inf. n. in an ex. cited<br>\
voce دَاحٌ in art. دوح,] and ↓ حُبَابٌ (S, K) and<br>\
↓ حِبَابٌ (K) and ↓ مَحَبَّةٌ (S) signify the same;<br>\
(S, K;) i. e., as above. (K.) The degrees of<br>\
حُبّ are as follow: first, هَوًى, the “ inclining of<br>\
the soul, or mind; ” also applied to the “ object<br>\
of love itself: ” then, عَلَاقَةٌ, “love cleaving to the<br>\
heart; ” so termed because of the heart&#39;s cleaving<br>\
to the object of love: then, كَلَفٌ, “violent, or<br>\
intense, love; ” from كُلْفَةٌ signifying “ difficulty,<br>\
or distress, or affliction: ” then, عِشْقٌ, [“ amorous<br>\
desire; ” or “ passionate love; ”] in the S, “excess<br>\
of love; ” and in the language of the physicians,<br>\
“ a kind of melancholy: ” then, شَغَفٌ, “ardour<br>\
of love, accompanied by a sensation of pleasure; ”<br>\
like لَوْعَةٌ and لَاعِجٌ; the former of which is<br>\
“ ardour of love; ” and the latter, “ardent love: ”<br>\
then, جَوًى, “inward love; ” and “ violence of<br>\
amorous desire,” or “ of grief, or sorrow: ” then,<br>\
تَتَيُّمٌ, “a state of enslavement by love: ” then<br>\

loss of reason, in love: ” and then, هُيَامٌ “ a state<br>\
of wandering about at random in consequence of<br>\
overpowering love. ” (Kull ubi suprà.) [Accord.<br>\
to the Msb, it is a simple subst.: but accord. to<br>\
the K, an inf. n.; and hence,] حُبًّا لِمَا أَحْبَبْتُمْ,<br>\
meaning أُحِبُّ حُبًّا [I love with loving, i. e. much,<br>\
what ye have loved]. (Har p. 186.) Hence the<br>\
phrase, وَكَرَامَةً ↓ نَعَمْ وَحُبَّةً [Yea; and with love<br>\
and honour will I do what thou requirest: or for<br>\
the sake of the love and honour that I bear thee:<br>\
or حبّة may be here used for حُبًّا to assimilate it<br>\
in termination to كرامة: see what follows]. (S,<br>\
TA.) Hence also the saying of Abu-l-&#39; Atà EsSindee,<br>\
فَوَاللّٰهِ مَا أَدْرِى وَإِنِّى لَصَادِقٌ<br>\
أَدَآءٌ عَرَانِى مِنْ حُبَابِكِ أَمْ سِحْرُ<br>\
[And by God, I know not (and indeed I am<br>\
speaking truth) whether disease have befallen me<br>\
in consequence of love of thee, or enchantment]:<br>\
(S, TA:) but IB says that the reading best known<br>\
is ↓ مِنْ حِبَابِكِ; and that حِباب, here, may be an<br>\
inf. n. of حَابَبْتُهُ; or it may be pl. of حُبٌّ, like as<br>\
عِشاشٌ is of عُشٌّ; (TA;) or it may be an inf. n.<br>\
of حَبَبْتُهُ: some also read ↓ مِنْ حَبَابِكِ, with fet-h<br>\
to the ح, said to mean on account of the love of<br>\
thee, and of the main amount thereof: (Ham<br>\
p. 26:) and some read مِنْ جَنَابِكِ “ from thy<br>\
part ” [or “ from thee ”]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
حَبِيبٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also a Persian word, arabicized,<br>\
(AHát, S, Msb,) from خُنْب, (AHát, TA,) [or<br>\
خُبْ or خُپْ,] i. q. خَابِيَةٌ, (S, Msb,) A jar, (K,<br>\
MF,) whether large or small, used for preparing<br>\
wine: (MF:) or a large jar: (K:) or one for<br>\
water: (IDrd, TA:) or the four pieces of wood<br>\
upon which is placed a two-handled, or two-eared,<br>\
jar: (K, TA: [in the CK, by a misplacement<br>\
of words, this last signification is assigned to<br>\
حَبَاب:]) pl. [of pauc.] أَحْبَابٌ (K) and [of mult.]<br>\
حِبَابٌ and حِبَبَةٌ. (S, Msb, K.) From this last<br>\
signification is [said to be] derived the phrase<br>\
حُبًّا وَكَرَامَةً [pronounced حُبًّا وَكَرَامَهْ, lit. A jarstand and a cover will I give thee, or the like],<br>\
كرامة signifying the “ cover ” of a jar, (K, TA,)<br>\
whether of wood or of baked clay. (TA.) [If<br>\
this be the true derivation, the phrase may have<br>\
originated from a person&#39;s asking of another the<br>\
loan or gift of a jar, and the latter&#39;s replying<br>\
“ Yea; and I will give thee a jar-stand and a<br>\
cover; ” meaning “ I will do what thou requirest,<br>\
and more: ” but this phrase is now, and perhaps<br>\
was in early times, generally used, agreeably with<br>\
the more common significations of the two words,<br>\
in the sense assigned above to the phrase حُبَّةً<br>\
وَكَرَامَةً.]<br>\

and ↓ حِبٌّ (S, K) and ↓ حُبَابٌ and ↓ حُبًّةٌ, which<br>\
last is also applied to a female, and has for its<br>\
pl. حُبَبٌ: (K:) the fem. of حَبِيبٌ is with ة;<br>\
(Msb, K;) and so is that of ↓ مَحْبُوبٌ, (K, TA,)<br>\
[and that of ↓ مُحَبٌّ,] and that of ↓ حِبٌّ: (TA:)<br>\
the pl. of حَبِيبٌ is أَحِبَّآءُ, instead of حُبَبَآءُ, which<br>\

مِنِّى بِمْنْزِلَةِ المُحَبِّ المُكْرَمِ<br>\

[and أَحِبَّآءُ and أَحِبَّةٌ, mentioned by Golius as<br>\
from the S, but not in my copies of the S: both,<br>\
however, are correct: the former, the more common: the latter, a pl. of pauc.]. You say اِمْرَأَةٌ<br>\

fire-fly;] a fly that flies in the night, (K,) resembling fire, (S,) emitting rays like a lamp:<br>\
(K:) AHn says that حباحب and ابوحباحب<br>\
were both unknown to him, and that nothing<br>\
respecting them had been heard by him from the<br>\
Arabs; but that some people asserted the insect<br>\
thus called to be the يَرَاع, a moth that, when it<br>\
flies by night, no person not knowing it would<br>\
doubt to be a spark of fire: Aboo-Tálib says,<br>\
as on the authority of Arabs of the desert, that<br>\
حباحب is the name of a flying thing longer than<br>\
the common fly, and slender, that flies between<br>\
sunset and nightfall, resembling a spark of fire:<br>\
(TA:) or, accord. to As, it is a flying thing, like<br>\
the common fly, with a wing that becomes red;<br>\
when it flies appearing at a distance like a lighted<br>\
piece of fire-wood. (Har p. 500.) نَارُ الحُبَاحِبِ<br>\
(S, K) and نَارُأَبِى حُبَاحِبٍ and simply الحُبَاحِبُ<br>\
(S) mean The fire of the fly above mentioned:<br>\
or of El-Hobáhib or Aboo-Hobáhib: (TA:)<br>\
[for] El-Hobáhib, (S,) or Aboo-Hobáhib, (K,)<br>\
is said to have been a niggardly man, who never<br>\
lighted any but a faint fire, fearing to attract<br>\
guests, so that his fire became proverbial. (S, K.)<br>\
El-Kumeyt says, describing swords,<br>\
يَرَى الرَّاؤُونَ بِالشَّفَرَاتِ مِنْهَا<br>\
كَنَارِ أَبِى حُبَاحِبَ وَالظُّبِينَا<br>\
[The beholders see, in the sides of the blades<br>\
thereof, and the extremities, the semblance of the<br>\
fire of the fire-fly]: (S:) here the poet has made<br>\
حباحب imperfectly decl., regarding it as a fem.<br>\
[proper] name [of the fly above mentioned]. (TA.)<br>\
Or نارالحباحب (S, K) and simply الحباحب (S)<br>\
signify The fire that is struck by a horse&#39;s hoofs:<br>\
(Fr, S:) or the sparks of fire that are made to<br>\
fly forth in the air by the collision of stones:<br>\
or the sparks that fall from the pieces of wood<br>\
that are used for producing fire [by means of<br>\
friction]: (K:) or they are derived from حَبْحَبَةٌ,<br>\
(IAar, K,) signifying “ weakness,” (IAar, TA,)<br>\
[and their meaning is faint fire.] ―<br>\
-b2-  أُمُّ حُبَاحِبٍ<br>\
A flying insect resembling the [species of locust<br>\
called] جُنْدَب, (K, * TA,) spotted with yellow<br>\
and green: when people see it, they say, بَرِّدِى<br>\
يَا حُبَاحِبُ [Spread forth thy wings (بُرْدَيْكِ),<br>\
hobáhib]; whereupon it spreads its two wings,<br>\
which are adorned with red and yellow. (TA.)<br>\
حَبَّذَا, meaning حَبِيبٌ, as in the phrase حَبَّذَا<br>\
الأَمْرُ [Loved, beloved, affected, loved, or approved,<br>\
is the thing, or affair; or lovely, charming, or<br>\
excellent, is it]; (K;) and in حَبَّذَا زَيْدٌ [Loved,<br>\
beloved, &amp;c., is Zeyd]; (S;) is composed of<br>\
حَبَّ, (Sb, Fr, S, K,) a verb of praise, in the<br>\
pret. form, invariable, originally حَبُبَ, (Fr, S,)<br>\
and ذَا, (Sb, Fr, S, K,) its agent, (S,) which<br>\
together constitute it a single word, (Sb, S, K,)<br>\
a noun, (Sb, K,) or occupying the place of a<br>\
noun, (S,) governing the noun [particularized<br>\
by praise] that follows it in the nom. case; (Sb,<br>\
S, K;) the place that it occupies in construction<br>\
making it virtually in the nom. case as an inchoative, and the noun that follows it being its<br>\
enunciative: (S:) [but see what follows.] It is<br>\
used in the same manner as a prov.; (Sb, K;)<br>\
[i. e., it is not altered to agree in number or<br>\
gender with the noun particularized by praise,<br>\
which follows it;] remaining the same when<br>\
used in the dual and pl. and fem. sense; so that<br>\
one says, حبّذا زَيْدٌ and الزَّيْدَانِ and الزَّيْدُونَ<br>\
and هِنْدٌ and أَنْتَ and أَنْتُمَا and أَنْتُمْ [&amp;c.];<br>\
(Ibn-Keysán, TA;) and حبّذا امْرَأَةٌ, not حَبَّذِهِ<br>\
المَرْأَةُ; (Sb, S, K; *) which shows that the noun<br>\
that follows it may not be regarded as a substitute<br>\
for ذا: (S:) [but see what follows.] It is allowable, but bad, to say, زَيْدٌ حَبَّذَا. (TA.) [There<br>\
are, however, various opinions respecting حبّذا<br>\
and the noun that follows it.] Some hold that<br>\
حبّذا is a noun, composed of حَبَّ and ذا, and<br>\
is an inchoative, and that the noun particularized<br>\
by praise is its enunciative; or that the former is<br>\
an enunciative, and the latter an inchoative,<br>\
reversing the usual order: others hold that حَبَّ<br>\
is a verb in the pret. form; and ذا, its agent;<br>\
and that the noun particularized by praise may<br>\
be an inchoative, of which حبّذا is the enunciative; or it may be an enunciative of which the<br>\
inchoative is suppressed, so that حبّذا زَيْدٌ is for<br>\
حبّذا هُوَ زَيْدٌ [Loved, or beloved, &amp;c., is this<br>\
person: he is Zeyd], or حبّذا المَمْدُوحُ زَيْدٌ [loved,<br>\
&amp;c., is this person: the person praised is Zeyd]:<br>\
others hold that حبّذا is a pret. verb, composed<br>\
of حَبَّ and ذا, and that the noun following it<br>\
is its agent; but this is the weakest of opinions:<br>\
one also says, in dispraise, لَاحَبَّذَا زَيْدٌ. (I &#39;Ak<br>\
p. 235.)<br>\
حَابٌّ An arrow that falls [in the space] around<br>\
the butt: pl. حَوَابُّ. (K.)<br>\
أَحَبُّ [More, and most, loved, beloved, &amp;c.<br>\
You say, هٰذَا أَحَبُّ إِلَىَّ مِنْ ذَاكَ This is more<br>\
an object of love, affection, liking, or approval,<br>\
or is more lovely, charming, or pleasing, to me<br>\
than that. And هُوَ أَحَبُّهُمْ إِلَىَّ He is the most<br>\
beloved of them to me.]<br>\
