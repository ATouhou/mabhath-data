حَسَبَهُ, (S, A, Mgh, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
حَسُبَ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, &amp;c.,) inf. n. حَسْبٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K)<br>\
and حُسْبَانٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and حِسْبَانٌ (K)<br>\
and حِسَابٌ (S, K,) which is generally an inf. n.<br>\
of this verb, but sometimes of حَاسَبَ, (TA,) and<br>\
حِسَابَةٌ (S, K) and حِسْبَةٌ, (Msb, K,) or this is like<br>\
قِعْدَةٌ and رِكْبَةٌ, [denoting a mode, or manner,]<br>\
as in a verse of En-Nábighah cited below, (S,)<br>\
and حَسْبَةٌ, which is of rare occurrence, (MF,<br>\
TA,) He numbered, counted, reckoned, calculated, or computed, it; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;)<br>\
namely, property [&amp;c.]. (A, Mgh, Msb.) You<br>\
say, مَنْ يَقْدِرُ عَلَى عَدِّ الرَّمْلِ وَحَسْبِ الحَصَى<br>\
[Who can count the sands, and number the pebbles?]. (A.) And أَلْقِ هٰذَا فِى الحَسْبِ [Throw thou<br>\
this into the reckoning]; i. e., into what thou hast<br>\
reckoned. (A.) وَالشَّمْسُ وَالقَمَرُ بِحُسْبَانٍ, in the<br>\
Kur [lv. 4], means And the sun and the moon [run<br>\
their courses] according to a [certain] reckoning;<br>\
or through a series of mansions [or constellations],<br>\
the bounds of which they do not transgress:<br>\
(TA:) or بحسبان alludes to the numbers of the<br>\
months and years and all other times: [but properly speaking,] حسبان is here an inf. n.: (Zj,<br>\
TA:) or, accord. to Akh, a pl. of حِسَابٌ; (S,<br>\
TA;) and so says AHeyth: or, accord. to some,<br>\
it is here a proper subst., signifying the firmament. (TA.) حُسْبَانًا in the Kur vi. 96 is held by<br>\
Akh to be for بِحُسْبَانٍ, meaning بِحِسَابٍ [as in<br>\
the phrase quoted above, from the Kur lv. 4,<br>\
accord. to the first explanation]. (TA.) And<br>\
حُسْبَانُكَ عَلَى اللّٰه signifies حِسَابُكَ على اللّٰه [On<br>\
God be it to reckon with thee: see also حَسِيبُكَ<br>\
اللّٰهُ]. (TA.) Az says that the reckoning in buying<br>\
and selling is termed حِسَابٌ because one knows<br>\
thereby what is sufficient. (TA.) وَاللّٰهُ سَرِيعُ<br>\
الحِسَابِ, in the Kur [ii. 198, &amp;c., God is quick<br>\
in reckoning], signifies that his reckoning is necessary, or of necessity, and that his reckoning<br>\
with one person does not divert Him from reckoning with another. (TA.) And يَرْزُقُ مَنْ يَشَآءُ بَغَيْرِ<br>\
حِسَابٍ, in the Kur [ii. 208, &amp;c., He supplieth<br>\
whom He willeth, without reckoning], means<br>\
without sparing, or scanting; as when a man<br>\
expends without reckoning: but the phrase is<br>\
variously explained, as meaning without appointing for any one what is deficient: or without<br>\
fearing that any one will call Him to account<br>\
for it: or without the receiver&#39;s thinking that<br>\
He will bestow upon him, or without his reckoning<br>\
upon the supply; so that it may be from حَسِبَ<br>\
“ he thought,” or from حَسَبَ “ he reckoned. ”<br>\
(L, TA.) The saying, cited by IAar,<br>\
يَا جُمْلُ أَسْقَاكِ بِلَا حِسَابَهْ<br>\
as related by J [in the S], but correctly أُسْقيت,<br>\
(TA,) means [O Juml, mayest thou be given rain]<br>\
without reckoning, and without measure. (S.)<br>\
An instance of حِسْبَةٌ as similar to قِعْدَةٌ and رِكْبَةٌ<br>\
occurs in the saying of En-Nábighah,<br>\
فَكَمَّلَتْ مِائَةً فِيهَا حَمَامَتُهَا<br>\
وَأَسْرَعَتْ حسْبَةً فِى ذٰلِكَ العَدَدٍ<br>\
[And she completed a hundred, in which was her<br>\
pigeon; and she was quick in the mode of computing that number]. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  حَسِبَهُ كَذَا, [a verb<br>\
of the kind termed أَفْعَالُ القُلُوبِ, having two<br>\
objective complements, the former of which is<br>\
called its noun, and the latter its enunciative,]<br>\
aor.<br>\
حَسَبَ and<br>\
حَسِبَ; (S, Msb, K;) the former the more<br>\
approved, (TA,) of the dialects of all the Arabs<br>\
except Benoo-Kináneh; the latter aor. being<br>\
peculiar to the dial. of this tribe, (Msb,) and<br>\
contr. to analogy, (S, Msb,) for by rule it should<br>\
be<br>\
حَسَبَ [only]; and حَسِبَ is the only verb of the<br>\
measure فَعِلَ having both يَفْعَلُ and يَفْعِلُ as the<br>\
measures of its aor. except نَعِمَ and يَئِسَ and يَبِسَ<br>\
[and وَعِرَ and وَحِرَ and بَئِسَ and وَلِهَ and وَهِلَ<br>\
mentioned by Ibn-Málik (with the preceding)<br>\
cited in the TA voce وَرِثَ]; but eight verbs<br>\
having an unsound letter for the first radical have<br>\
kesreh to the medial radical in the pret. and aor.,<br>\
viz., وَثِقَ and وَرِثَ and وَرِعَ and وَرِمَ and وَرِيَ and<br>\
وَفِقَ and وَلِىَ and وَمِقَ; (S;) inf. n. حِسْبَانٌ (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K) and مَحْسَبَةٌ and مَحْسِبَةٌ (S, K)<br>\
and حِسَابٌ; (TA; [but see what follows;]) He<br>\
[counted, accounted, reckoned, or esteemed, meaning] thought, or supposed, him, or it, to be so.<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K.) You say, حَسِبْتُهُ صَالِحًا [I<br>\
counted him, or thought him, good, or righteous].<br>\
(S.) And حَسِبْتُ زَيْدًا قَائِمًا [I thought Zeyd to<br>\
be standing]. (Msb.) And مَا كَانَ فِى حِسْبَانِى<br>\
كَذَا [Such a thing was not in my thought]: you<br>\
should not say فى حِسَابِى, (K,) unless you mean<br>\
thereby it was not included in my reckoning, or,<br>\
by amplification of the sense, I did not think it.<br>\
(MF.)<br>\
-A3-  حَسُبَ, aor.<br>\
حَسُبَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. حَسَابَةٌ<br>\
(S, K) and حَسَبٌ, (Msb, K,) He was, or became,<br>\
characterized, or distinguished, by what is termed<br>\
حَسَبٌ as explained below [i. e. grounds of pretension to respect or honour; &amp;c.]. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
حسّبهُ, inf. n. تَحْسِيبٌ: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He<br>\
placed a pillow for him; supported him with a<br>\
pillow; (S, K;) seated him upon a حُسْبَانَة, or<br>\
مَحْسَبَة. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And hence, He honoured him.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He buried him: (TA:) or buried him<br>\
in stones: [see حَسْبٌ:] or buried him wrapped<br>\
in grave-clothing: namely, a dead person. (K,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Nuheyk El-Fezáree says, (S, TA,) addressing &#39;Ámir Ibn-Et-Tufeyl, (TA,)<br>\
لَتَقَيْتَ بِالوَجْعَآءِ طَعْنَةَ مُرْهَفٍ<br>\
↓ حَرَّانَ أَوْ لَثَوَيْتَ غَيْرَ مُحَسَّبِ<br>\
(S, TA) Thou wouldst have avoided, by turning<br>\
thy hinder part, the thrust [of a thin, thirsty<br>\
weapon], or thou wouldst have taken thy restingplace (TA) not honoured, or not shrouded, (S,<br>\
TA,) or not pillowed: غير محسّب being variously<br>\
rendered: one person prefers the meaning not<br>\
buried: Az says that the signification of burial in<br>\
stones and that of wrapping in grave-clothes,<br>\
assigned to the verb, were unknown to him; and<br>\
that غير محسّب signifies not supported with a<br>\
pillow. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
حاسبهُ, inf. n. مُحَاسَبَةٌ (S, TA) and sometimes حِسَابٌ, which is also an inf. n. of حَسَبَ, or,<br>\
accord. to Th, it seems to be a quasi-inf. n., (TA,)<br>\
[He reckoned with him.] And حاسبهُ عَلَيْهِ [He<br>\
called him to account for it]. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
احسبهُ, (Th, S, K,) inf. n. إِحْسَابٌ, (TA,)<br>\
He gave him what sufficed, or satisfied, him,<br>\
مِنْ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ of everything: (Th, TA:) he contented him: (K:) or he gave him what contented<br>\
him; as also ↓ حسّبهُ: (S:) and both verbs, inf. n.<br>\
of the latter تَحْسِيبٌ, he gave him to eat and<br>\
drink until he was satisfied: (K:) and the former,<br>\
[or both,] he gave him until he said حَسْبِى [It is<br>\
sufficient for me]. (AZ, S.) You say also, أَعْطَى<br>\
فَأَحْسَبَ He gave, and (assumed tropical:)  gave much: (S:) and<br>\
↓ اِحْتَسَبْتُهُ, [if not a mistranscription for أَحْسَبْتُهُ,]<br>\
(tropical:)  I gave him much. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also It (a<br>\
thing, S, Msb,) sufficed him: (S, A, Msb:) he<br>\
sufficed him. (TA.) You say, مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ أَحْسَبَكَ<br>\
مِنْ رَجُلٍ, and [مِنْ رَجُلَيْنِ] بِرَجُلَيْنِ أَحْسَبَاكَ, and<br>\
[مِنْ رِجَالٍ] بِرِجَالٍ أَحْسَبُوكَ, I passed by a man<br>\
sufficient for thee as a man, i. e., supplying to<br>\
thee the place of any other [by his excellent qualities], and by two men &amp;c., and by men &amp;c. (S.)<br>\
[The verb here is rendered, in grammatical analysis, by its act. part. n. See also حَسْبُ.]<br>\
5<br>\
تحسَب (tropical:)  He sought, or sought leisurely and<br>\
repeatedly, to learn news: (A, K, * TA:) he sought<br>\
after news: (K, * TA:) he inquired, or asked, respecting news; (S, K, * TA; [in the CK, اسْتَخْيَرَ<br>\
is erroneously put for اِسْتَخْبَرَ;]) of the dial. of<br>\
El-Hijáz: (TA:) he searched after news as a<br>\
spy. (A &#39;Obeyd, TA.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
accord. to one reading, كَانُوا يَجْتَمِعُونَ فَيَتَحَسَّبُونَ<br>\
الصَّلَاةَ (tropical:)  They used to assemble, and endeavour to<br>\
ascertain the time of prayer: but the common<br>\
reading is يَتَحَيَّنُونَ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also He reclined<br>\
upon a pillow. (K.)<br>\
8<br>\
احتسب [for احتسب أَجْرًا He reckoned upon<br>\
a reward: or] he sought a reward [from God in<br>\
the world to come]. (TA.) وَيَرْزُقُهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ<br>\
لَا يَحْتَسِبُ, in the Kur lxv. 2, means [And He will<br>\
supply him with the means of subsistence] whence<br>\
he does not reckon, or expect; whence does not<br>\
occur to his mind. (Bd, Jel.) And مَنْ صَامَ<br>\
رَمَضانَ إِيمَانًا وَاحْتِسَابًا, in a trad., Whoso fasteth<br>\
during Ramadán, believing in God and his<br>\
Apostle, and [reckoning upon a reward, or] seeking a reward from God. (Mgh, * TA.) You<br>\
say also, احتسب بِكَذَا أَجْرًا عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ (S, K) He<br>\
reckoned upon obtaining, [or he sought,] by such<br>\
a thing, or such an action, a reward from God:<br>\
(PS:) or he prepared, or provided, such a thing,<br>\
seeking thereby a reward from God. (K.) And<br>\
احتسب عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ خَيْرًا He prepared, or provided,<br>\
in store for himself, good, [i. e. a reward,] with<br>\
God. (A, Mgh.) And احتسب الأَجْرَ عَلَى اللّٰهِ<br>\
He laid up for himself, in store, the reward,<br>\
with God, not hoping for the reward of the<br>\
present life; اِحْتِسَابُ الأَجْرِ relating only to an<br>\
action done for the sake of God. (Msb.) [Hence,]<br>\
احتسب وَلَدَهُ, (A, Mgh,) or ابْنَهُ, (Msb,) or ابْنًا,<br>\
or بنْتًا, (S, K, *) is said when one has lost by<br>\
death an adult child or son or daughter; (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) meaning He prepared, or provided, in store for himself, a reward, by his<br>\
patience on the occasion of his being afflicted and<br>\
tried by the death of his adult child: (Mgh, *<br>\
TA:) when a man has lost by death a child not<br>\
arrived at the age of puberty, you say of him,<br>\
اِفْتَرَطَهُ. (S, A, Msb, K.) [Hence also,] احتسب<br>\
عَمَلَهُ [He reckoned upon, or prepared for himself, a reward by his deed: or] he did his deed<br>\
seeking a reward from God in the world to come.<br>\
(L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اِحْتَسَبْتُ بَالشَّىْءِ I included the thing<br>\
in a numbering, or reckoning; or made account<br>\
of it; accounted it a matter of importance.<br>\
(Msb.) And فُلَانٌ لَا يُحْتَسَبُ [for لا يحتسب بَهِ]<br>\
Such a one is made no account of; is not esteemed,<br>\
or regarded, as of any account, or importance.<br>\
(A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اِحْتَسَبْتُ عِنْدَهُ means اِكْتَفَيْتُ [I<br>\
was, or became, sufficed, or contented, thereat, or<br>\
with him, or at his abode]. (A, TA.) [And<br>\
IbrD thinks that the verb has the same signification in the phrase اِحْتَسَبْتُ عَلَيْهِ بِالمَالِ, quoted in<br>\
the TA from the A; holding عليه to be here<br>\
used in the sense of عَنْهُ; so that the meaning is<br>\
I was, or became, sufficed, so as to have no need<br>\
of him, or it, by the property: but I doubt<br>\
whether this phrase be correctly transcribed.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
احتسب also signifies اِنْتَهَى [He abstained, or<br>\
desisted; app. as one sufficed, or contented].<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And احتسب عَلَيْهِ كَذَا He disapproved<br>\
and disallowed his doing, or having done, such a<br>\
thing; (S, K; *) namely, a foul deed: (TA:)<br>\
whence the appellation ↓ مُحْتَسِبٌ. (K.) And<br>\
accord. to some, احتسب اللّٰهَ عَلَيْهِ means He said,<br>\
May God take, or execute, vengeance upon him;<br>\
or punish him; for his evil deeds. (Har p. 371.<br>\
[See حَسِيبٌ.]) [In the present day, احتسب عَلَيْهِ<br>\
is used as meaning He prayed for aid against<br>\
him by saying, حَسْبُنَا اللّٰهُ God is, or will be,<br>\
sufficient for us.] ―<br>\
-b6-  You say also, احتسب فُلَانًا,<br>\
(K,) or احتسب مَا عِنْدَهُ, (A,) meaning (tropical:)  He<br>\
endeavoured to learn what such a one had [in his<br>\
mind, or in his possession]. (A, K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
See also 4.<br>\
9<br>\
احسبّ He (a camel) was, or became, of a<br>\
white colour intermixed with red (S, TA) and<br>\
with black. (TA.)<br>\
حَسْبٌ Sufficiency. (K voce هَسْبٌ.) ―<br>\
-b2-  حَسْبُ<br>\
is a [prefixed] noun (S) [syn. with كَفْىُ, as is<br>\
implied in the K voce قَطْ; or] syn. with كَافِى;<br>\
(Msb;) or [virtually] meaning كَفَى [as a pret.<br>\
in the sense of an emphatic aor.]; (S, K;) or<br>\
يَكْفِى: (TA:) Sb says that it is used to denote<br>\
the being sufficed, or content. (TA.) You say,<br>\
حَسْبُكَ دِرْهَمٌ [and بِحَسْبِكَ دِرْهَمٌ, in which latter<br>\
the ب is redundant; meaning Thy sufficiency, or<br>\
a thing sufficing thee, is a dirhem; a phrase<br>\
which may be used in two ways; as predicating<br>\
of what is sufficient, that it is a dirhem; and as<br>\
predicating of a dirhem, that it is sufficient; in<br>\
which latter case, بحسبك is an enunciative put<br>\
before its inchoative, (as also حَسْبُكَ,) so that the<br>\
meaning is, a dirhem is a thing sufficing thee,<br>\
i. e. a dirhem is sufficient for thee; as is shown<br>\
in a marginal note in my copy of the Mughnee,<br>\
in art. بِ; or, accord. to the S and K, a dirhem<br>\
suffices thee: accord. to Bd (iii. 167), بحسبك<br>\
means مُحْسِبُكَ, and كَافِيكَ, from أَحْسَبَهُ meaning<br>\
كَفَاهُ; and is shown to have this meaning by its<br>\
not importing a determinate signification in consequence of its being a prefixed noun with its<br>\
complement in the saying, هٰذَا رَجُلٌ حَسْبُكَ This<br>\
is a man sufficing thee]. (S, Msb, K.) You say<br>\
also, حَسْبُكَ ذٰلِكَ That is, or will be, [or let that<br>\
be,] sufficient for thee. (TA.) And حَسْبُكَ اللّٰهُ,<br>\
in the Kur viii. 65, God is, or will be, sufficient<br>\
for thee. (Fr, TA. See also حَسِيبُكَ اللّٰهُ.) And<br>\
حَسْبُكَ بِصَدِيقِنَا [A person sufficing thee is our<br>\
friend]; in which the ب is added to denote<br>\
emphatic praise. (Fr, TA in art. بِ.) In the<br>\
saying, هٰذَا رَجُلٌ حَسْبُكَ مِنْ رَجُلٍ This is a man<br>\
sufficing thee as a man, i. e. supplying to thee the<br>\
place of any other [by his excellent qualities],<br>\
(S, K,) and مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ حَسْبِكَ مِنْ رَجُلٍ I passed<br>\
by a man sufficing thee as a man, (TA,) حسبك<br>\
is an expression of praise, referring to the indeterminate noun [رجل]; because, in its case, [what is<br>\
originally (see below)] an inf. n. (فِعْلٌ [under<br>\
which term lexicologists, but not grammarians,<br>\
include the مَصْدَر]) is rendered, in grammatical<br>\
analysis, by another word, [i. e., by an act.<br>\
part. n.,] as though one said مُحْسِبٌ لَكَ, or كَافٍ<br>\
لَكَ. (S. [Thus حسبك in these two instances is<br>\
a صِفَة, i. e. an epithetic phrase; and من رجل<br>\
is a تَمْيِيز, i. e. a specificative phrase.]) When<br>\
the noun to which حسبك refers is determinate,<br>\
you put حسب in the accus. case, as a حال, i. e.<br>\
a denotative of state; as in the saying, هٰذَا عَبْدُ<br>\
اللّٰهِ حَسْبَكَ مِنْ رَجُلٍ This is &#39;Abd-Allah; being<br>\
one sufficing thee as a man. (S. [Here من رجل<br>\
is, as before, a specificative phrase.]) [See also<br>\
4, the corresponding verb.]) حسب, in this<br>\
manner, is used alike as sing. and dual and pl.;<br>\
(S, K;) being [originally] an inf. n. (S.) It is<br>\
also used alone, [as a prefixed noun of which the<br>\
complement is understood,] as in the phrase<br>\
زَيْدٌ حَسْبُ, without tenween, for حَسْبِى or حَسْبُكَ<br>\
[&amp;c., meaning Zeyd is sufficient for me or for<br>\
thee &amp;c.]; like as one says, جَآءَنِى زَيْدٌ لَيْسَ غَيْرُ,<br>\
for لَيْسَ غَيْرُهُ عِنْدِى. (S. [That is, حَسْبُ, when<br>\
thus used, is subject to the same rules as غَيْرُ and<br>\
قَبْلُ, and بَعْدُ &amp;c. when so used.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also<br>\
حَسَبٌ, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  Also, (TA,) and ↓ حِسْبَةٌ,<br>\
(K,) Burial of the dead: (TA:) or burial of the<br>\
dead in stones [app. meaning in a grave cased<br>\
with stones]: or burial of the dead wrapped in<br>\
grave-clothes: like تَحْسِيبٌ. (K. [See 2.])<br>\
حَسَبٌ i. q. ↓ مَحْسُوبٌ; (S, K;) of the measure<br>\
فَعَلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, like نَفَضٌ<br>\
in the sense of مَنْفُوضٌ; (S;) Numbered, counted,<br>\
reckoned, calculated, or computed. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
A number counted. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Amount, quantity,<br>\
or value. (L.) Sometimes, (S, L, K,) by poetic<br>\
license, (S,) and in prose, (L,) ↓ حَسْبٌ. (S, L,<br>\
K.) You say, الأَجْرُ بِحَسَبِ مَا عَمِلْتَ, and<br>\
↓ بِحَسْبِ, The recompense is, or shall be, according to the amount, or quantity, or value, of thy<br>\
work. (L.) And يُجْزَى المَرْءُ عَلَى حَسَبِ عَمَلِهِ<br>\
The man is, or shall be, paid according to the<br>\
amount, or quantity, of his work. (Msb.) And<br>\
عَلَى حَسَبِ مَا أَسْدَيْتَ إِلَىَّ شُكْرِى لَكَ [and ↓ حَسْبَمَا<br>\
(for عَلَى حَسَبِ مَا)] According to the amount, or<br>\
value, of the benefit, or benefits, that thou hast<br>\
conferred upon me are my thanks to thee. (L.)<br>\
And لِيَكُنْ عَمَلُكَ بِحَسَبِ ذٰلِكَ Let thy deed, or<br>\
work, be correspondent to the quantity, or number,<br>\
of that: or adequate, or equivalent, to that. (S.)<br>\
And هٰذَا بِحَسَبِ ذَا This is equal in number or<br>\
quantity, or is equivalent, to that. (K.) And<br>\
مَا أَدْرِى مَا حَسَبُ حَدِيثِكَ, i. e. ما قَدْرُهُ [app. I<br>\
know not what is the value of thy story]. (Ks, S.)<br>\
And أَحْسَنْتُ إِلَيْهِ حَسَبَ الطَّاقَةِ and عَلَى حَسَبِ<br>\
الطَّاقَةِ I benefited him according to the measure<br>\
of ability. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also [Grounds of pretension to respect or honour, consisting in any<br>\
qualities (either of oneself or of one&#39;s ancestors)<br>\
which are enumerated, or recounted, as causes<br>\
of glorying: and hence signifying nobility; rank<br>\
