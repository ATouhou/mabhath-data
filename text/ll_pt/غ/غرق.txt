Accord. to the copies of the K, اغترقت الَّفْسُ, meaning اِسْتَوْعَبَت: but this is a mistake: the correct phrase is اغترق النَّفَسَ, the latter word مُحَرَّكَة [and in the accus. case]; and the explanation, اِسْتَوْعَبَهُ فِى الزَّفِيرِ.

                  نَظَرَهُمْ, said of a woman, (tropical:)  [<i>She engrosses their look;</i> i. e.] <i>she occupies them in looking at her so as to divert them from looking at other than her, by reason of her beauty:</i> (O, K, TA:) and in like manner one says, تغترق الطَّرْفَ (tropical:)  [<i>she engrosses the look</i>].

See also 8 [with which it is interchangeable in several cases]. ―         -b2-  اِسْتَغْرَقَ فِى الضَّحِكِ is like, (O, TA,) or syn. with, (K,) اِسْتَغْرَبَ (tropical:)  [<i>He exceeded the usual bounds,</i> or <i>degree, in laughing; was immoderate in laughing</i>].
