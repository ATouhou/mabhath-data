                  <i>Dark;</i> applied to night (لَيْل); as also ↓ <br>\
      مُغْضٍ, but this latter is rare: (S, Msb:) and so غَاضِيَةٌ, (S, K,) applied to a night (لَيْلَة): (S:) or, thus applied, accord. to Az, <i>intensely dark.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  And غَاضِيَةٌ signifies also <i>Bright,</i> or <i>shining brightly;</i> (S, K;) applied to a night, (thus in one of my copies of the S,) or to fire (نَار): (so in other copies of the S and in the TA:) thus having two contr. meanings. (S, K.) ―         -b3-  And <i>Great;</i> applied to a fire (نار): a signification said by Az to be taken from the fire of the tree called غَضًا, which is of the best of firewood.
