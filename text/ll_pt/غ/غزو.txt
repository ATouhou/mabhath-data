                  ,] inf. n. غَزْوٌ, <i>He willed,</i> or <i>desired, it; he sought it;</i> and <i>he aimed at it, intended it,</i> or <i>meant it;</i> syn. اَرَادَهُ; and طَلَبَهُ; and قَصَدَهُ; [the first of which is often used in the same senses as the second and third;] as also ↓ <br>\
      اغتزاهُ; (K, TA;) this last mentioned by ISd as syn. with قَصَدَهُ. (TA.) One says, عَرَفْتُ مَا <br>\
                  يُغْزَى مِنْ هٰذَا الكَلَامِ i. e. [<i>I knew,</i> or, emphatically, <i>I know,</i>] <i>what is willed</i> or <i>desired</i> (مَا يُرَادُ) [<i>from this speech</i>]. (S.) And غَزْوِى <br>\
                  كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>My aim,</i> or <i>intention,</i> or <i>meaning, is such a thing.</i> (K.) ―         -b2-  [Hence, app.,] غَزَا العَدُوَّ, inf. n. غَزْوٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and غَزَوَانٌ, (K, TA,) or, as some say, غَزْوَانٌ, mentioned by Sb, (TA,) and غَزَاوَةٌ, (K,) [but see what is said of this last at the close of this paragraph,] <i>He went forth,</i> (Er-Rághib, TA,) or <i>repaired,</i> or <i>betook himself,</i> (Mgh,) <i>to wage war,</i> (Er-Rághib, TA,) or <i>to fight,</i> (Mgh,) <i>with the enemy;</i> (Er-Rághib, Mgh, TA;) or <i>he went to fight with, and plunder, the enemy;</i> (K, TA;) <i>in the country of the latter.</i> (Msb.) [And غَزَا alone, the objective complement being understood, often signifies the same; or <i>He engaged in a warring,</i> or <i>warring and plundering, expedition,</i> or <i>in such expeditions.</i>] ―         -b3-  And غَزَا اـِلَيْهِ, inf. n. as above, <i>He tended, repaired, betook himself,</i> or <i>went, to,</i> or <i>towards, him,</i> or <i>it;</i> syn. قَصَدَهُ. (TA.)       -A2-  غَزَاوَةٌ, mentioned above, is of a measure which in most instances is that of an inf. n. of an intrans. verb, and it seems to be an inf. n. of which the verb is غَزُوَ, meaning جَادَ غَزْوُهُ [i. e. <i>Excellent,</i> or <i>how excellent, is his engaging in a warring,</i> or <i>warring and plundering, expedition,</i> or <i>in such expeditions!</i>]; and to be similar to قَضُوَ meaning جَادَ قَضَا=ءُهُ, and ضَرُبَتْ يَدُهُ meaning جَادَ ضَرْبُهَا.
