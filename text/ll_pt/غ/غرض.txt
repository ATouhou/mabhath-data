                  , (S, K,) inf. n. غَرَضٌ, (S, A, K,) <i>He was vexed,</i> or <i>disquieted by grief, and by distress of mind; he was grieved, and distressed in mind: he was disgusted; he turned away with disgust.</i> (S, A, K.) You say, غَرِضَ مِنْهُ <br>\
                  <i>He was vexed by,</i> or <i>at, him,</i> or <i>it, and disquieted by grief, and by distress of mind; he was grieved, and distressed in mind, by him,</i> or <i>it:</i> (Mgh in art. غرض, and TA:) <i>he was disgusted with it,</i> or <i>at it; he turned away from it with disgust:</i> (Mgh:) and <i>he feared him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K, TK: but the first and second mention only the inf. n. of the verb in this last sense.) And غَرِضَ بِالمُقَامِ, aor. and inf. n. as above, [<i>He was vexed,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>by continuance, stay, residence,</i> or <i>abode,</i> in a place: <i>he was disgusted with it,</i> or <i>at it.</i>] (S.) And اـِذَا <br>\
                  فَاتَهُ الغَرَضُ فَتَّهُ الغَرَضُ i. e. الضَّجَرُ [<i>When the object of aim,</i> or <i>endeavour, escapes him, so that he cannot attain it, vexation,</i> or <i>disquietude by grief, and by distress of mind,</i> or <i>disgust, crushes him</i>]. (A, TA.) ―         -b2-  And hence, (A,) aor. as above, (K,) and so the inf. n., (A, TA,) <i>He yearned,</i> or <i>longed:</i> (S, A, K:) or <i>he yearned,</i> or <i>longed, vehemently,</i> or <i>intensely:</i> (TA:) اـِلَيْهِ <br>\
                  <i>for him,</i> or <i>it:</i> (S:) or اـِلَى لِقَايِهِ <br>\
                  <i>for meeting with him:</i> the verb in this sense being made trans. by means of الى because it imports the meaning of اِشْتَاقَ and حَنَّ [which are made trans. by the same means]: (A, TA:) [for] accord. to Akh, غَرِضْتُ اـِلَيْهِ signifies غَرِضْتُ مِنْ <br>\
                  هٰوُلا=ءِ اـِلَيْهِ [<i>I turned with vexation,</i> or <i>disgust, from these, to him,</i> or <i>it</i>]; because the Arabs connect the verb [with its objective complement] by means of all these particles [mentioned above; namely, ب and من and الى]. (S.) Mbr reckons غَرَضٌ, as meaning both “ being disgusted ” and “ yearning ” or “ longing, ” among words having contrary significations; and so does Ibn-Es-Seed; (MF;) and in like manner, IKtt. (TA.) [Perhaps these derive the latter meaning from غَرَضٌ signifying “ a butt, ” or “ an object of aim, ” &amp;amp;c.]       -A2-  غَرَضَ عَنْهُ, (TA,) [in the TK غَرَضَهُ,] inf. n. غَرْضٌ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K,) <i>He</i> (a man, TA) <i>refrained, forbore, abstained,</i> or <i>desisted, from him,</i> or <i>it; left, relinquished,</i> or <i>forsook, him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, * K, * TA.)       -A3-  غَرُضَ, aor.      <br>\

(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, TS, K. *) ―         -b3-  غَرَضَ السَّخْلَ, (S, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above; (TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      غرّضها; (K;) (assumed tropical:)  <i>He weaned the lambs,</i> or <i>kids, before their time.</i> (ISk, S, K.) ―         -b4-  غَرَضَتْ سِقَا=ءَهَا, (S, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (S,) (assumed tropical:)  <i>She</i> (a woman, S) <i>churned,</i> or <i>agitated, the contents of her milk-skin, and when its butter had formed in little clots but had not collected together, she poured out the milk, and gave it to people to drink.</i> (ISk, S, K. *) ―         -b5-  غَرَضْتُ لَهُ غَرِيضًا (tropical:)  <i>I gave him to drink fresh milk.</i> (TA.) ―         -b6-  غَرَضْتُ لِلضَّيْفِ غَرِيضًا (tropical:)  <i>I fed the guests with food that had not been kept through the night:</i> so in the A: but in the K, لَهُمْ ↓ <br>\
      اَغْرَضَ <br>\
                  غَرِيضًا (tropical:)  <i>he kneaded for them fresh dough, and did not feed them with food that had been kept through the night.</i> (TA.)       -A5-  غَرَضَهُ, aor.      <br>\
                     غَرِضَ<br>\
                  , [inf. n. غَرْضٌ,] also signifies <i>He filled it,</i> namely, a vessel, (S, K,) and a skin, and a wateringtrough; (TA;) and so ↓ <br>\
      اغرضهُ. (K.) ―         -b2-  And <i>He stopped short of filling it completely.</i> (S, K. [See also 2.]) Thus it has two contr. significations. (S, K.) A rájiz says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
