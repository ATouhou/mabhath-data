<b>غَيْرٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     غَيْرٌ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                   signifies <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  سِوًى [<i>Other</i>]: and the pl. is اَغْيَارٌ: (S:) [but غَيْر itself often has a pl. meaning, as will be seen in what follows:] or [accord. to general usage, as will be seen below,] غَيْرُ signifies <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  سِوَى [<i>other than; exclusively of;</i> or <i>not,</i> as used before a substantive or an adjective]. (Msb, K: in the CK [erroneously] سِوًى.) It is used to qualify a subst.; [governing (as a prefixed noun) the noun that follows it in the gen. case;] and when so used, it is put in the same case as the noun preceding it. (S.) It qualifies an indeterminate noun: (Mughnee, Msb:) you say جَا=ءَنِى رَجُلٌ غَيْرُكَ [<i>A man, other than,</i> or <i>not, thou, came to me</i>]: (Msb:) and نَعْمَلْ صَالِحًا <br>\
                  غَيْرَ اْلَّذِى كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ [<i>We will in that case do good, other than,</i> or <i>not, what we used to do:</i> (Kur xxxv. 34:)]: (Mughnee:) and مِنْ مَا=ءٍ غَيْرِ ا=سِنٍ [<i>Of water other than,</i> or <i>not, altered in taste and colour</i>]. (Kur xlvii. 16.) It is a noun necessarily prefixed, as to the sense, to a noun which it governs in the gen. case: but sometimes it is without the latter, when the meaning is understood and it is preceded by لَيْسَ, (Mughnee, K,) or by لَا: (K:) [in which case it signifies <i>Any other person</i> or <i>thing; any person</i> or <i>thing beside,</i> or <i>else:</i>] you say قَبَضْتُ عَشَرَةً لَيْسَ غَيْرُهَا [<i>I received ten; not other than they</i> was received by me; i. e., <i>not any other thing;</i> or <i>not anything beside,</i> or <i>else</i>]; (Mughnee, K;) the enunciative, مَقْبُوضًا, being suppressed: (Mughnee:) and ليس <br>\
                  غَيْرَهَا, (Mughnee, K;) the noun [of ليس] being understood; i. e., لَيْسَ المَقْبُوضُ غَيْرَهَا: (Mughnee:) and ليس غَيْرَ; in which the affixed noun [for المضاف, in the K, I read المضاف اليه, as in the Mughnee,] is suppressed, and the noun [of ليس] is also understood: (Mughnee, K:) and ليس غَيْرُ; (Mughnee, K;) in which, accord. to Mbr, and the later authors, غير is indecl., being likened to قَبْلُ and بَعْدُ, so that it may be either the noun or the enunciative [of ليس] or, accord. to Akh, it is decl., because it is not a noun of time like قَبْلُ and بَعْدُ, nor of place like فَوْقُ and تَحْتُ, but like كُلٌّ and بَعْضٌ, so that it is the noun [of ليس], and the enunciative is suppressed; (Mughnee;) or it may be either indecl. or decl., (Mughnee, K,) accord. to Ibn-Kharoof: (Mughnee:) and ليس غَيْرًا, and ليس غَيْرٌ; (Mughnee, K;) in both which cases it is decl., as though the affixed noun were mentioned: (Mughnee:) and لَا غَيْرُ; for the saying, [which we find in the Mughnee,] app. taken from a statement of Seer, that this is incorrect, is not good, since it occurs in the following verse, cited by Ibn-Málik; <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        جَوَابًا بِهِ تَنْجُو اْعْتَمِدْ فَوَرَبِّنَا<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        لَعَنْ عَمَلٍ اَسْلَفْتَ لَا غَيْرُ تُسْاَلُ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>Aim thou at</i> having <i>an answer by which thou mayest be safe; for, by our Lord, respecting an action which thou shalt have done before, not any other thing,</i> or <i>not anything beside</i> or <i>else, thou wilt be asked</i>]. (K.) ―         -b2-  It does not become determinate by its being prefixed to another noun, because it is very vague: but it is also applied as an epithet to a determinate noun which is near to being indeterminate; as in صِرَاطَ <br>\
                  اْلَّذِينَ اَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ اْلْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ [<i>The way of those upon whom Thou hast conferred favour; the other than,</i> or <i>those who are not, the objects of anger;</i> (Kur i. 6 and 7;)] because the noun rendered determinate by the art. ال denoting a genus is near to being indeterminate, and because when غير occurs between two contraries its vagueness becomes weakened, (Mughnee, K, *) or altogether departs: (K:) or it is here applied as an epithet to a determinate noun because it resembles a determinate noun in its being prefixed to such a noun: (Msb:) Az says that غير is here in the gen. case because it is an epithet to الذين; and that it may be an epithet to [what is technically termed in this instance] a determinate noun [as having the article ال prefixed to it] because الذين has not [in itself] a direct meaning (لِاَنَّ الَّذِينَ <br>\
                  غَيْرُ مَصْمُودٍ صَمْدُهُ), [it being merely a conjunct noun, the meaning of which is determined by what follows it,] notwithstanding it has the art. ال prefixed to it: Abu-l-&#39;Abbás says that Fr holds الذين to have the office of an indeterminate noun; and غير to be an epithet of it; not of any other noun; but that غير, accord. to some, may be an epithet relating to the nouns implied in انعمت <br>\
                  عليهم, these not having a direct meaning: Akh says that غير [with what follows] is a substitute [for الذين with what follows], as though the meaning were صِرَاطَ غَيْرِ المَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ [<i>the way</i> <br>\
                  <i>of those who are not the objects of anger</i>]. (TA.) The reading غَيْرَ is also related, on the authority of Ibn-Ketheer, in the accus. case, as a denotative of state, [meaning <i>they being not the objects of anger,</i>] relating to the pronoun governed in the gen. case by the prep. [in عليهم]; or by اَعْنِى [<i>I mean</i>] understood; or as an exceptive, [accord. to a usage to be explained below,] if the favours be interpreted as conferred in common upon the two classes of persons. (Bd.) ―         -b3-  As it resembles a determinate noun in its being prefixed to a determinate noun, [as المغضوب in the above-cited passage of the Kur,] some have presumed to prefix to it the article ال: but against this it may be urged, that its prefixion to a determinate noun is not to render the expression determinate, but for specification; and ال does not imply specification. (Msb.) ―         -b4-  In the following verse of Hassán, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        اَتَانَا فَلَمْ نَعْدِلْ سِوَاهُ بِغَيْرِهِ<br>\

                        نَبِىٌّ بَدَا فِى ظُلْمَةِ اللَّيْلِ هَادِيَا<br>\
                  </quote> the meaning is, [<i>A prophet came to us, who appeared in the darkness of night, a director in the right way,</i>] <i>and we did not weigh another than him with another than the other,</i> i. e., <i>with him.</i> (Mughnee.) ―         -b5-  [وَغَيْرُ ذٰلِكَ is a phrase of frequent occurrence, meaning <i>Et cœtera.</i>] ―         -b6-  غَيْرُ is also used in the sense of لَيْسَ [He, or it, <i>is not</i>]; as in the phrase كَلَامُ اْللّٰهِ غَيْرُ مَخْلُوقٍ [<i>The word of God is not created</i>], syn. لَيْسَ بِمَخْلُوقٍ. (Az, TA.) ―         -b7-  It is also used in the sense of لَا [meaning <i>Not,</i> as used before a participle]; (S, K;) and then it is in the accus. case, as a denotative of state; (S;) as in the phrase فَمَنِ اْضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ, (S, K,) in the Kur [ii. 168, and other places], (S,) i. e., جَايِعًا لَا بَاغِيًا [<i>But whosoever is necessitated,</i> being hungry, <i>not transgressing the due bounds</i>]. (S, K.) ―         -b8-  It is also used as an exceptive, (S, Mughnee,) in the sense of اـِلَّا [<i>Except; save;</i> or <i>but</i>]; (Msb, K;) and then it is put in the same case in which the word following اـِلَّا would be put in the same phrase, (S, Mughnee, Msb, K,) because it is originally a qualificative, and its use as an exceptive is adventitious: (S:) therefore you say جَا=ءَ القَوْمُ غَيْرَ زَيْدٍ [<i>The people came, except Zeyd</i>]; and مَا جَا=ءَنِى اَحَدٌ غَيْرَ <br>\
                  زَيْدٍ and غَيْرُ زَيْدٍ [<i>Not any one came to me, except Zeyd</i>]: (Msb, K:) or its case depends upon the governing words, so that you say مَا قَامَ غَيْرُ زَيْدٍ [<i>No one stood, except Zeyd</i>], and مَا رَاَيْتُ غَيْرَ زَيْدٍ [<i>I saw not</i> any, <i>except Zeyd</i>]: (Msb:) but Fr says that some of the Benoo-Asad and Kudá&#39;ah put غير in the accus. case, when used in the sense of اـِلَّا, whether the phrase before it be complete or incomplete; saying مَا جَا=ءَنِى غَيْرَكَ [<i>Not</i> any one <i>came to me, except thou</i>], and ما جاءنى اَحَدٌ غَيْرَكَ [<i>Not any one came to me, except thou</i>]: (S, Msb:) and AA says that when غير has the place of اـِلَّا, it is put in the accus. case. (Msb.) In the saying لَا اـِلٰهَ غَيْرُ اْللّٰهِ [<i>There is no deity other than God</i>], غير is in the nom. case because it is the enunciative of لا; but it may be put in the accus. case, as meaning اـِلَّا. (Msb.) When, as an exceptive, it is prefixed to an indecl. word [and not preceded by a prep.], it may be itself indecl., with fet-h for its termination; as in the following verse; <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
