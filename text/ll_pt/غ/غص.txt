      اِغْتَصَّ:] accord. to some of those skilled in the science of lexicology, you say غَصَّ when it is by food, and شَرِقَ when it is by beverage, [or by the spittle, and water, and the like, (see art. شرق,)] and شَجِىَ when it is by a bone, and جَرِضَ when it is with spittle; but every one of these is sometimes used in the place of any other: (MF:) and [thus] you say also, غَصَّ بِالمَا=ءِ, meaning, <i>his throat,</i> or <i>fauces, became choked,</i> or <i>obstructed, by the water;</i> or <i>the water stopped therein, and he was hardly able to swallow it.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] غَصَّ بِرِيقِهِ [lit., <i>His throat,</i> or <i>fauces, became choked by his spittle;</i>] meaning, (tropical:)  <i>he died.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  Hence, also, غَصَّ <br>\

(Msb.) ―         -b4-  [And غَصَّ, alone, seems to signify (assumed tropical:)  <i>He became grieved,</i> or <i>disquieted in mind;</i> like as does شَجِىَ (q. v.): and it seems to be indicated in the CK that ↓ <br>\
