                  غُشْىٌ: (Mgh:) or it is <i>a repletion of the venters of the brain with a cold, thick, phlegm;</i> (Mgh, Msb;) thus accord. to the physicians, who distinguish between it and غُشْىٌ, as do the lawyers: (Mgh:) [see also غُشِىَ عَلَيْهِ:] the patient is said to be عَلَيْهِ ↓ <br>\

      غَمًى, (Msb, K,) mean [<i>Upon the sky is,</i> or <i>was,</i>] <i>what veiled,</i> or <i>concealed, the new moon:</i> (Msb, K:) not from غُمَّ: (K:) this addition in the K is meant as an indirect slur upon J, for his having mentioned [in this art.] the statement of Fr that one says صُمْنَا لِلْغُمَّى and لِلْغَمَّى, meaning <i>We fasted when the new moon was veiled,</i> or <i>concealed, to us;</i> and هِىَ لَيْلَةُ الغَمَّى [or الغُمَّى]; the [proper] place of which is [the section of words whereof the last radical is] م: (TA:) [see غَمٌّ, in that art.: but accord. to Fei,] one says [also], ↓ <br>\
