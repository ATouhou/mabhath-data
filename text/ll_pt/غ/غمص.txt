                  <i>I blamed him,</i> or <i>found fault with him, for a saying that he said.</i> (S.) ―         -b3-  And hence, (TA,) غَمَصَ النِّعْمَةَ, (S, K,) and غَمِصَهَا, (K,) the latter is the form authorized by the T and the Deewán el-Adab, this verb and [its syn.] غمط being there said to be both with kesr to the م, (TA,) <i>He was ungrateful,</i> or <i>unthankful, for the favour</i> or <i>benefit;</i> (S, K, TA;) <i>he despised it, and disacknowledged it.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  [Hence also, app.,] غَمَصَ اْللّٰهُ الخَلْقَ <br>\

                  <i>This thing,</i> or <i>affair, turned against me, and became attended with trouble.</i> (JK.) ―         -b3-  [And hence, perhaps,] لَا تَغْمَصْ عَلَىَّ [in the CK تَغْمِصْ] <i>Be not thou angry with me:</i> so accord. to the O [and the JK]: but accord. to the K, <i>do not thou lie against me,</i> or <i>utter falsehood.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  العَيْنِ: (TA:) [or the reason of its being so called is this:] the Arabs assert that the شِعْرَيَانِ are the sisters of سُهَيْل [or Canopus]; (IDrd, S;) and that they [three] were together; but that سهيل descended into the south, and الشِّعْرَى <br>\
                  اليَمَانِيَّةُ [which is Sirius] followed it; (IDrd;) this latter, they say, crossed the Milky way, and was therefore named العَبُورُ; and الغميصاء remained in her place, weeping for the loss of the two others until her eye became affected with غَمَص: (IDrd, K: *) they also assert that thou seest العبور when she rises as though she desired to cross [the Milky Way] (كَاَنَّهَا تَسْتَعْبِرُ); but الغميصاء thou seest not [as yet in any part of Arabia], she having wept until she has become affected with غَمَص.
