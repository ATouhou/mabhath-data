                  : see غَنِيمَةٌ, in three places. ―         -b2-  It signifies also [The <i>regaining</i> (as is shown by an explanation of A &#39;Obeyd cited in the first paragraph of art. غلق), and] the <i>increase, and growth, and excess in value,</i> of a pledge. (O in art. غلق, and TA in the present art.) Thus in a trad., in which it is said, الرَّهْنُ لِمَنْ رَهَنَهُ لَهُ غُنْمُهُ وَعَلَيْهِ غُرْمُهُ [<i>The pledge pertains to him who pledged it; to him pertains the regaining of it, and its increase, and growth, and excess in value, if such there be, and upon him lies the obligation to pay the debt for it, without requiring any abatement thereof if the pledge have unavoidably suffered damage or total loss:</i> see the explanation of A &#39;Obeyd mentioned above].

                  غُرْم [i. e. <i>the regaining</i> of the pledge, <i>with the increase and the growth and the excess in value</i> thereof <i>if such there be, is compensated by the payment of the debt</i> for it]; for like as the owner [of the pledge] is exclusively entitled to the غُنْم, no one sharing it with him, so he bears the غُرْم, no one bearing it with him: and this is the meaning of their saying, الغُرْمُ <br>\
                  مَجْبُورٌ بِالغُنْمِ [which may therefore be rendered <i>The loss suffered by the payment of the debt is repaired by the regaining</i> of the pledge; app. a phrase of the lawyers, implying that such is to be considered as the case whatever be the state of the pledge at the time of its being restored unless it have suffered damage through the fault of the pledgee].

                  شَا=ءٌ, (T, Msb, K,) meaning <i>Sheep</i> and <i>goats;</i> (Msb;) [and <i>both together;</i>] a gen. n., (S, Msb, K,) of the fem. gender, (S, K,) applied to the <i>males</i> and the <i>females,</i> and to <i>both together:</i> (S, Msb, K:) it has no sing. from which it is derived, the sing. being شاة: the dual غَنَمَانِ is used as meaning <i>two flocks</i> or <i>herds</i> [<i>of sheep</i> or <i>of goats</i> or <i>of both together</i>]; (Msb, K;) each flock or herd having its distinct place of pasture and its pastor: (Msb, TA: *) and hence it is said in a trad. that the poor-rate [meaning a portion thereof] is to be given to him to whom the year of drought has left a غَنَم, but not to him to whom it has left غَنَمَيْنِ: (TA:) the pl. is اَغْنَامٌ, (Msb, K,) [properly a pl. of pauc.,] sometimes used, (Msb,) meaning flocks or herds of غَنَم, (Msb and TA in art. ابل,) and also غُنُومٌ and اَغَانِمُ, (K,) the last used in an ode of Aboo-Jundab El-Hudhalee: (TA:) the dim. is ↓ <br>\
      غُنَيْمَةٌ, with ة, because quasi-pl. ns. of the class having no sing. from which they are derived, when applied to what are not human beings, are constantly fem.; so one says خَمْسٌ مِنَ الغَنَمِ ذُكُورٌ [<i>five of sheep, males</i>], making the n. of number fem., though one means <i>rams,</i> when it is followed by مِنَ الغَنَمِ, for the n. of number is masc. and fem. accord. to the word, not accord. to the meaning. (S.) ―         -b2-  In the saying لَا ا=تِيكَ غَنَمَ الفِزْرِ i. e. حَتَّى تَجْتَمِعَ غَنَمُ الفِزْرِ [<i>I will not come to thee until the sheep,</i> or <i>goats, of El-Fizr congregate</i>], غنم [with its complement] is made to stand in the place of الدَّهْر, [the meaning being, <i>I will not come to thee ever,</i>] and is [therefore] put in the accus. case as though it were an adv. n. [of time]. (TA. [This saying with مِعْزَى in the place of غَنَمَ is mentioned by El-Meydánee in his “ Proverbs, ” and thus in the S and K in art. فزر. For an explanation of its origin see Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 484.]) ―         -b3-  الاَغْنَامُ is the name of (assumed tropical:)  <i>Certain small stars between the legs of Cepheus and the star</i> <br>\

      غُنْمٌ all signify فَىْءٌ [as meaning <i>Spoil, booty,</i> or <i>plunder</i>]: and the <i>acquisition</i> of a thing <i>without difficulty,</i> or <i>trouble,</i> or <i>inconvenience:</i> or this is termed ↓ <br>\
      غُنْمٌ, and فَىْءٌ is termed غَنِيمَةٌ: (K:) or, accord. to A &#39;Obeyd, الغَنِيمَةُ signifies <i>what is obtained from the believers in a plurality of gods, by force, during war;</i> (Mgh, Msb:) <i>and of this, a fifth is to be taken,</i> [<i>and applied in the manner prescribed in the Kur</i> viii. 42,] <i>and what remains after the fifth is for those who have obtained it, exclusively;</i> (Mgh;) <i>the horseman having three shares, and the foot-soldier having one share:</i> (Az, TA:) and الفَىْءُ signifies what is obtained from them after the laying-down of arms, (Mgh, Msb,) when the country, or place, becomes a country, or place, of Islám; and this is for all of the Muslims, and is not to be divided into fifths: (Mgh:) or the فَىْء is what God has given, or restored, of the possessions of the believers in a plurality of gods, to the Muslims, without war, such as the poll-tax, and that for which peace has been made with them; and of this also a fifth is to be applied in the manner prescribed by God, and the remainder is to be expended in the purchase of horses and weapons and other apparatus for the defence of the frontiers: (Az, TA:) and النَّفَلُ is what is given to the warrior in addition to his share; and is when the Imám or the commander says, “ He who slays one shall have his spoil; ” or says to a detachment, “ What ye obtain shall be yours, ” or “ the quarter of it, ” or “ the half of it; ” and it is not divided into fifths; and it lies on the Imám to fulfil the promise: or, accord. to &#39;Alee Ibn-&#39;Eesà, الغَنِيمَةُ is more general in signification than النَّفَلُ; and الفَىْءُ is more so than الغَنِيمَةُ, because it is a name for everything of the possessions of the believers in a plurality of gods that becomes the property of the Muslims: accord. to the lawyers, everything that may be lawfully taken, of their possessions, is فَىْء: (Mgh:) the pl. of غَنِيمَةٌ is غَنَايِمُ; and the pl. of ↓ <br>\
