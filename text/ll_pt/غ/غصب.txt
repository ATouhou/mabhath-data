                  , (Msb, K,) inf. n. غَصْبٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb;) and ↓ <br>\
      اغتصبهُ; (S, Msb, K;) <i>He took it wrongfully, unjustly,</i> or <i>injuriously;</i> (S, A, Mgh, K;) or <i>by force;</i> (Mgh, Msb;) مِنْهُ and عَلَيْهِ [i. e. <i>from him</i>], both meaning the same. (S.) الغَصْبُ repeatedly occurs in the traditions, signifying <i>The taking another&#39;s property wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously,</i> or <i>by violence.</i> (L.) But as employed in law, it means <i>The taking property that has a price and is forbidden, without the permission of its owner, without stealthiness:</i> therefore it does not rightly apply in the case of an animal that has died a natural death or not been slaughtered according to the law, because it is not property; nor in the case of the free person, in like manner; nor in the case of the wine of the Muslim, because it has not a price; nor in the case of the property of him with whom one is at war, because it is not forbidden; the saying “ without the permission of the owner ” precludes the trust, or deposit; and the saying “ without stealthiness ” excludes theft. (KT.) ―         -b2-  One says also, غَصَبْتُهُ مَالًا and غَصَبْتُ مِنْهُ مَالًا <br>\
                  <i>I took property from him</i> [<i>wrongfully,</i> &amp;amp;c., or] <i>by force.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b3-  And غَصَبَهَا <br>\
                  نَفْسَهَا (Msb, TA) and نفسها ↓ <br>\
      اغتصبها (Msb) (tropical:)  <i>He violated her; forced her; had connection with her against her will;</i> (TA;) or <i>constuprated her by force.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b4-  And غَصَبَ فُلَانًا عَلَى الشَّىْءِ (K, TA) and ↓ <br>\
      اغتصبه (TA) <i>He compelled such a one by force to do the thing.</i> (K, TA.) ―         -b5-  And غَصَبَ الجِلْدَ, (K, TA,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  <i>He removed from the skin its hair and its fur by plucking and peeling, without subjecting it to the process termed</i> <br>\
                  عَطْنٌ, <i>in the tan, and without</i> <br>\
                  اـِغْمَال [i. e. <i>burying</i> it] <i>in moist earth,</i> (K, TA,) or [<i>soaking it in</i>] <i>urine</i> [<i>to loosen the hair and fur</i>], <i>and without folding it up:</i> so Az heard it expl. by the Arabs. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   see 1, in three places. ―         -b2-  One says also, of a woman, اُغْتُصِبَتْ نَفْسَهَا, meaning (tropical:)  <i>She was constuprated by force;</i> (A, Mgh, Msb;) as also اُغْتُصِبَتْ عَلَى نَفْسِهَا. (Msb.)    </entryFree> <br>\
