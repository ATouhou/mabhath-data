[There are <i>three</i> habits, (خِصَال being understood, these, as is said in the O, being “ the acting sincerely towards God, ” and “ giving honest counsel to those in command, ” and “ keeping to the community ” of the Muslims,)] <i>while conforming to which the heart of the believer will not be invaded by rancour, malevolence, malice,</i> or <i>spite,</i> causing it to swerve from that which is right; (S, * O;) a saying of the Prophet; thus related by some: accord. to others, ↓ <br>\
      يُغِلُّ, (S, O,) with damm to the ى, (O,) which is from the meaning expl. in the next sentence here following. (S, * O.)       -A4-  غَلَّ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) aor. يَغُلُّ, (S, O,) inf. n. غُلُولٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) <i>He acted unfaithfully;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      اغلّ: (S, O, Msb, K:) or thus the latter, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) accord. to ISk (S, Msb) and A&#39;Obeyd, (S,) in a general sense; (Mgh, Msb;) and <i>he became unfaithful:</i> (TA:) but the former verb is used only in relation to spoil, or booty; (S, Mgh, O, * Msb, K;) you say, غَلَّ مِنَ المَغْنَمِ meaning خَانَ [i. e. <i>He acted unfaithfully in taking from the spoil,</i> or <i>booty</i>]; (S, O;) or meaning <i>he acted unfaithfully in relation to the spoil,</i> or <i>booty:</i> (Mgh:) or غَلَّ, (IAth, Mgh, TA,) aor. as above, (Mgh,) inf. n. غُلُولٌ, (IAth, TA,) or غَلٌّ, (Mgh, [thus in my copy, accord. to which it is trans., as will be shown by what follows,]) signifies also <i>he stole;</i> and <i>was unfaithful in respect of a thing privily;</i> and such conduct is termed غُلُولٌ because, in the case thereof, the hands, or arms, have the غُلّ [q. v.] put upon them: (IAth, TA:) or it signifies also <i>he took</i> a thing <i>and hid</i> it <i>amid his goods;</i> and it occurs in a trad. as meaning <i>he took</i> a شَمْلَة <br>\
                  <i>privily.</i> (Mgh.) It is said in the Kur [iii. 155], وَمَا كَانَ لِنَبِىٍّ اَنْ يَغُلَّ and اَنْ ↓ <br>\
      يُغَلَّ, accord. to different readers; the former meaning [<i>And it is not attributable to a prophet</i>] <i>that he would act unfaithfully;</i> and ↓ <br>\
      ان يُغَلَّ meaning, [agreeably with an explanation of اَغَلَّ <br>\
                  فُلَانًا in the K,] <i>that unfaithful conduct should be imputed to him;</i> or <i>that there should be taken from his</i> [<i>share of the</i>] <i>spoil,</i> or <i>booty;</i> (S, O, TA;) [or this may mean, <i>that he should be found to be acting unfaithfully;</i> for, accord. to the TA, اغلّ الرَّجُلَ means وَجَدَهُ غَالًّا;] but IB says that a pass. aor. is seldom found in the language of the Arabs in a phrase of this kind. (TA.) And it is said in a trad. وَلَا اـِسْلَالَ ↓ <br>\
      لَا اـِغْلَالَ i. e. <i>There shall be no acting unfaithfully nor stealing:</i> or <i>there shall be no act of bribery</i> [<i>nor stealing</i>]: (S, O:) or, as some say, <i>there shall be no aiding</i> another <i>to act unfaithfully</i> [&amp;amp;c.].

                  عَلَى الشَّىْءِ, inf. n. غَلٌّ; and ↓ <br>\
      اغلّ; <i>He was silent at the thing:</i> and also <i>he was intent upon the thing.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>He perfumed himself with</i> <br>\
                  غالية: (K:) Lh mentions تَغَلَّى بِالغَالِيَةِ, which is either from the word غَالِيَة or originally تَغَلَّلَ, in the latter case being like تَظَنَّيْتُ for تَظَنَّنْتُ, but the former is the more agreeable with analogy: accord. to Fr, one says, بالغالية ↓ <br>\
      تَغَلَّلْتُ, and not تَغَلَّيْتُ: (TA:) As held ↓ <br>\
      تَغَلَّلْتُ from الغالية to be allowable if meaning <i>I introduced the</i> <br>\
                  غالية <br>\
                  <i>into my beard</i> or <i>my mustache;</i> (S, O;) and the like is the case with respect to غَلَّلْتُ بِهَا لِحْيَتِى: (S:) accord. to Lth, one says, from الغالية, غَلَّلْتُ and غَلَّفْتُ and غَلَّيْتُ. (TA. [See also 1 in art. غلف; and see art. غلى.])    </entryFree> <br>\
