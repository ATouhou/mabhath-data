                  , aor. يَغِيضُ, inf. n. غَيْضٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and مَغَاضٌ (Msb, K) and مَغِيضٌ, (TA,) <i>It</i> (water) <i>became scanty,</i> or <i>little in quantity, and sank into the earth,</i> or <i>disappeared in the earth:</i> (S, and so in some copies of the K:) or <i>became scanty,</i> or <i>little in quantity, and decreased,</i> or <i>diminished,</i> or <i>became deficient:</i> (A, and so in some copies of the K:) or <i>sank into the earth, and went away:</i> (TA:) or <i>went away into the earth;</i> (Msb;) [<i>contr. of</i> <br>\

      انغاض, (S, K,) which is of the dial. of El- Hijáz. (TA.) ―         -b2-  <i>It</i> (a thing, Msb, a flow of milk, TA, and (assumed tropical:)  the price of a commodity, S, Msb, K) <i>decreased,</i> or <i>diminished,</i> or <i>became deficient.</i> (S, Msb, K.) ―         -b3-  وَمَا تَغِيضُ اْلْاَرْحَامُ وَمَا <br>\
                  تَزْدَادُ, (S, * K, * TA,) in the Kur [xiii. 9], (S,) means <i>And the wombs&#39; falling short</i> [<i>of completion</i> or <i>of what is usual</i>], (Akh, S, Bd,) <i>and their exceeding</i> [<i>therein</i>], <i>in respect of the body</i> [<i>of the fœtus</i>], <i>and the period of gestation, and the number borne:</i> (Bd:) or, as some say, <i>in respect</i> <br>\
                  <i>of the menstrual blood:</i> (Bd:) or <i>the wombs&#39; falling short of the nine months</i> (Zj, O, L, and so in copies of the K, but in others <i>seven months,</i>) <i>of gestation, and their exceeding the nine</i> [or <i>seven</i>] <i>months:</i> (Zj, O, L:) or <i>the wombs&#39; falling short of completion, so that the fœtus dies, and their exceeding so that the gestation becomes complete:</i> and accord. to this explanation, the reading of seven months in the K may be correct: see also Katádeh&#39;s explanation of غَيْضٌ, below, which favours this reading. (TA.) ―         -b4-  You say also, غَاضَ الكِرَامُ وَفَاضَ اللِّيَامُ (S, A) (tropical:)  <i>The generous became few,</i> (S, TA,) and <i>failed,</i> or <i>perished,</i> (TA,) <i>and the mean became many.</i> (S.)       -A2-  غَاضَهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor. as above, inf. n. غَيْضٌ, (TA,) <i>He</i> (God, S, Msb) <i>made it</i> (i. e. water) <i>to become scanty,</i> or <i>little in quantity, and to sink into the earth,</i> or <i>disappear in the earth:</i> (S:) or <i>made it to decrease,</i> or <i>diminish,</i> or <i>become deficient:</i> (K:) or <i>made it to go away into the earth:</i> (Msb:) and ↓ <br>\
      اغاضهُ signifies the same; (S, A, K;) and so does ↓ <br>\
      غيّضهُ, inf. n. تَغْيِيضٌ: (TA:) thus the first of these verbs is trans. as well as intrans. (S.) [It is said in the Kur xi. 46,] وَغِيضَ اْلْمَا=ءُ (S, A) <i>And the water was made to become scanty,</i> &amp;amp;c.: (S:) or <i>was made to decrease,</i> or <i>diminish.</i> (A, * Bd.) And hence the saying of &#39;Áïsheh, describing her father, وَغَاضَ نَبْعَ الرِّدَّةِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>And he did away with what appeared of apostacy.</i> (TA.) You say also, دَمْعَهُ ↓ <br>\
      غيّض, (S, * K,) inf. n. as above, (K,) <i>He made his tears to diminish,</i> (S, K,) <i>and restrained them:</i> (S:) or <i>he took the tears from his eye and dashed them away.</i> (Th.) A poet says, (TA,) namely, Jereer, (O and TA in art. غبض,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\

                  </quote> meaning <i>They made their tears to flow until they exhausted them</i> [<i>and they said to me, What is it that thou hast experienced, of love, and we have experienced?</i>]: ISd says that من here denotes some; or it may be redundant, accord. to the opinion of Abu-l-Hasan; for he holds that it may be so in affirmative [as well as negative] phrases, mentioning, as an instance, قَدْ كَانَ مِنْ <br>\
                  مَطَرٍ, meaning قَدْ كَانَ مَطَرٌ. (TA.) One relation of this verse gives غَبَّضْنَ; but the former is the right. (O and TA in art. غبض.) ―         -b2-  Also <i>He opened a way, passage,</i> or <i>channel, for it</i> (namely water) <i>to flow forth to a</i> <br>\
                  مَغِيض [q. v.]. (Msb.) ―         -b3-  (assumed tropical:)  <i>He diminished it,</i> namely the price of a commodity; (Ks, S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      اغاضهُ. (K.) ―         -b4-  And <i>He caused him to suffer loss,</i> or <i>detriment;</i> and <i>wronged,</i> or <i>injured, him.</i> (ISd, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  </quote> is said by some to mean غَايِظ, the ض being substituted for ظ; [so that the verse should be rendered, <i>To God I complain of three qualities,</i> or <i>habits, of a friend whom I love, every one of which is to me such as angers;</i>] thus says IJ: but ISd says that it may be without substitution, from غَاضَهُ as expl. in the last sentence of the first paragraph of this art.; and thus the meaning may be, <i>such as causes me to suffer loss,</i> or <i>detriment,</i> and <i>such as wrongs,</i> or <i>injures, me.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
