                     غَبَطَ<br>\
                  ; (Ibn-Buzurj, Sgh, K;) inf. n. غَبْطٌ (ISk, Az, S, Msb, K) and غِبْطَةٌ, (S, K,) or the latter is a simple subst.; (Msb;) <i>He regarded him</i> [<i>with unenvious emulation,</i> i. e.] <i>with a wish for the like of his condition,</i> (ISk, Az, S,) meaning a good condition, (Az,) or <i>for the like of that which he had attained,</i> (Msb,) or <i>for a blessing,</i> (K,) <i>and that it might not pass away,</i> (ISk, K,) or <i>without desiring that it should pass away,</i> (Az, S, Msb,) <i>from the latter person:</i> (ISk, Az, S, Msb, K:) the doing so is not حَسَدٌ, (Az, S, Msb,) for this implies the desire that what is wished for may pass away from its possessor; (Az, Msb;) or it is a kind of حَسَد, of a more moderate quality: (Az:) or غِبْطَةٌ and غَبْطٌ have the signification shown above, and are also <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  حَسَدٌ; (K;) this latter meaning is assigned to غَبْطٌ by IAar; and it is said that the Arabs use غَبْطٌ in the sense of حَسَدٌ metonymically; (TA;) [so that غَبَطَهُ and غَبِطَهُ may also mean (tropical:)  <i>he envied him;</i> &amp;amp;c.; see an ex. in a prov. cited voce بَطْنٌ; but it is said that] حَسَدٌ, when it is for courage and the like, is syn. with غِبْطَةٌ, and then it implies admiration, without a wish that the thing admired may pass away from its possessor. (Msb in art. حسد.) You say, غَبَطَهُ بِهِ, (S,) and عَلَيْهِ, (IAth,) and فِيهِ, (Msb,) <i>He regarded him with a wish for the like of it,</i> meaning a thing or state which he had attained, <i>without desiring that it should pass away from the latter person.</i> (S, IAth, * Msb.) Mohammad was asked, “ Does الغَبْط injure? ” and he answered, “ Yes, like as الخَبْط injures: ” or, accord. to the relation of A&#39;Obeyd, “ No, save as الخَبْط injures the [trees called] عِضَاه: ” (Az, TA:) [see خَبَطَ:] by الغيط meaning, accord. to some, الحَسَد: (TA:) or a kind thereof, of a more moderate quality; injurious, but not so injurious as الحسد whereby one wishes that a blessing may pass away from his brother; الخبط meaning the beating off the leaves of trees; after which they become replaced, without there resulting any injury therefrom to the stock and branches: moreover, الغبط sometimes occasions the smiting of its object with the evil eye. (Az, TA.) [See also غِبْطَةٌ, below.]       -A3-  Accord. to IKtt, غَبَطَ signifies also <i>He lied;</i> but perhaps it is a mistranscription for عَبَطَ, which has this meaning; for it is not mentioned by any other. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
                     غَبَّطَ<br>\
                   It is said in a trad., جَا=ءَ وَهُمْ يُصَلُّونَ فَيَجْعَلَ <br>\
                  يُغَبِّطُهُمْ; thus it is related, meaning, [<i>He came</i> to them <i>while they were praying, and he began</i>] <i>to incite them to wish for the like</i> of that action: if related without teshdeed, [يَغْبِطُهُمْ,] the meaning is, <i>to regard them with a wish for the like condition,</i> because of their forwardness to prayer.

(As.) ―         -b4-  And اَغْبَطَتِ السَّمَا=ءُ (tropical:)  <i>The sky rained continually.</i> (S, Msb, K, TA.)  And اَغْبَطَ عَلَيْنَا المَطَرُ (tropical:)  <i>The rain continued upon us incessantly, rain following close upon rain.</i> (Aboo-Kheyreh.) ―         -b5-  And اَغْبَطَ النَّبَاتُ (tropical:)  <i>The herbage covered the land, and became dense, as though it were from a single grain.</i> (K, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
