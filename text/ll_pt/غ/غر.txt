[But I incline to think that the اَ in اَغَرَّ is the interrogative particle, and that its explanation is اَجَسَّرَ, with the same particle; and the more so as I have not found any authority, if this be not one, for اَجْسَرَ in the sense of جَسَّرَ: so that the meaning of the verse is, <i>Have the teats,</i> &amp;amp;c.? and it shows that غَرَّهُ مِنْهُ, not اَغَرَّهُ, means جَسَّرَهُ عَلَيْهِ, like غَرَّهُ بِهِ. See 1.] ―         -b2-  Also <i>He caused him to fall into peril, danger, jeopardy, hazard,</i> or <i>risk.</i> (TA.)
