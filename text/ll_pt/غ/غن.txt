                  خَيَاشِيم [expl. above]: J has erred in saying that it is applied to طَيْر [i. e. birds, or flying things]: (K:) or if by طير he mean flies (ذُبَابٌ), his saying thus is not a mistake, for it is applied to them [as meaning <i>making a humming sound</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b3-  [Hence,] وَادٍ اَغَنُّ (assumed tropical:)  <i>A valley abounding with herbs</i> or <i>herbage:</i> for to such the flies constantly keep, and in their sounds is a غُنَّة. (S.

(assumed tropical:)  [<i>A meadow,</i> or <i>garden,</i>] <i>abounding with herbs</i> or <i>herbage:</i> or <i>in which the winds pass with a sound that is not clear,</i> [i. e. <i>with a confused, humming,</i> or <i>murmuring, sound,</i>] <i>by reason of the denseness of its herbs</i> or <i>herbage.</i> (K, TA.) And [for the same reason one says] عُشْبٌ اَغَنُّ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Herbs,</i> or <i>herbage, tall, full-grown,</i> or <i>of full height, and in blossom.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  And (hence also, S) قَرْيَةٌ غَنَّا=ءُ (tropical:)  [<i>A town,</i> or <i>village,</i>] <i>abounding with inhabitants</i> (S, K, TA) <i>and buildings</i> (K, TA) <i>and herbs</i> or <i>herbage</i> [<i>so that in it is heard the hum of men and women and of flies &amp;amp;c.</i>].
