                  : see غَيْطَلٌ. ―         -b2-  Also <i>A company,</i> or <i>collection,</i> (Th, K, TA,) <i>of men:</i> (K, TA:) or the <i>assembling of men, and their becoming in a dense,</i> or <i>confused, state.</i> (IAar, TA.) ―         -b3-  And <i>Darkness;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      غَيْطُولٌ; (K;) or the latter signifies <i>confusedness of darkness;</i> (IDrd, O;) or signifies also <i>dense</i> (lit. <i>accumulated</i>) <i>darkness.</i> (K. [The Arabs describe thick darkness as “ darknesses one above another: ” see Kur xxiv. 40.]) And The <i>intricate and confused blackness</i> of night: (S, O, K:) or غَيْطَلَةُ اللَّيْلِ signifies <i>the confusedness and denseness of the darkness</i> [<i>of night</i>]: and the pl. is غَيَاطِلُ.

And The <i>eating and drinking and rejoicing, with security.</i> (Fr, O, K.) ―         -b7-  And الغَيْطَلَةُ (accord. to Fr, as is said in the O and TA,) signifies المَالُ المُطْغِى [as though most probably meaning <i>Property that causes extravagance</i>]: (O, K, TA:) [but from what SM remarks respecting it, I can only infer that he holds المُطْغِى to be an epithet applied to the cow as signifying “ having a youngling, ” which is termed طَغْيَا or طُغْيَا, (like المُعْجِلُ signifying “ having a calf, ” which is termed عِجْلٌ, and several other epithets of the same form,) and in like manner applied to a collective number of cows, though I do not find it mentioned in this sense; i. e., that he understands; and would explain, المَالُ المُطْغِى as signifying <i>The cattle,</i> meaning <i>cows, having younglings:</i> but his derivation of it seems to be far-fetched; and perhaps he may have been led to assign this meaning to it by another explanation of غَيْطَلَةٌ with which it is agreeable, and which will be found in the next sentence:] it is not [he says] from طَغَا, aor. يَطْغُو, signifying اَسْرَفَ فِى الظُّلْمِ, as it seems to be at first sight; but from طَغَتْ said of the بَقَرَة وَحْشِيَّة, signifying صَاحَتْ, the like of which is also said of the ثَوْر. (TA.) ―         -b8-  غَيْطَلَةٌ signifies also <i>Such as has milk, of gazelles,</i> or <i>antelopes,</i> and <i>of beasts of the bovine kind</i> [perhaps meaning <i>of the wild species,</i> i. e. <i>bovine antelopes</i>]; (S, O, K;) pl. غَيَاطِلُ: (S, O:) accord. to AO, the بَقَرَة وَحْشِيَّة [or <i>bovine antelope</i>]: (S, O:) Th says that it signifies the بَقَرَة [or <i>beast of the bovine kind, bull</i> or <i>cow</i>], not particularizing the wild species.
