(TA.) And [these two pls.] غَدَايِدُ and غِدَادٌ signify also <i>Lots, portions,</i> or <i>shares:</i> (L, K:) thus, accord. to Fr, the former of them means in a verse of Lebeed cited and expl. voce عَدِيدَةٌ; but the reading better known is عَدَايِدُ: accord. to Az, غَدَايِدُ in this instance signifies <i>redundances.</i> (L.)    </entryFree> <br>\
