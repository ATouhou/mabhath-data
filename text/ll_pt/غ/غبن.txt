      انغبن [in like manner signifies] <i>he became</i> [<i>cheated</i> or <i>endamaged</i> or] <i>overcome</i> in selling and buying. (Msb.) And it is said that غَبَنَ فِى البَيْعِ, inf. n. غَبْنٌ, signifies <i>He was unmindful,</i> or <i>inadvertent,</i> [or perhaps غَبَنَ is here a mistranscription for غُبِنَ, signifying thus, and therefore meaning <i>he was made to suffer loss,</i>] <i>in selling</i> or <i>in buying.</i> (TA.) And one says also, غُبِنَ الرَّجُلُ اَشَدَّ الغَبَنَانِ [<i>The man was cheated</i> or <i>deceived</i> &amp;amp;c. <i>with the utmost degree of cheating</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA.) غَبْنٌ يَسِيرٌ [<i>A petty overreaching</i> or <i>endamaging</i>] is <i>one of which the rate is such as has been estimated</i> [<i>as allowable by custom</i>] <i>by one estimator, not by every one:</i> and غَبْنٌ فَاحِشٌ [<i>An exorbitant overreaching</i> or <i>endamaging</i>] is <i>one of which the rate is such as has not been estimated</i> [<i>as allowable by custom</i>] <i>by any one.</i> (Dict. of Technical Terms used in the Sciences of the Musalmans.) [الغُبْنُ وَالغَبَنُ mentioned by Freytag as occurring in the Fákihet el-Khulafà, and expl. by him as meaning “ Fraus omnimoda, ” should, I doubt not, be الغَبْنُ وَالغَبَنُ, the two inf. ns. mentioned in the first sentence above.] ―         -b2-  غَبَنَهُ, aor.      <br>\
                     غَبِنَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. غَبْنٌ, signifies also <i>He passed by him</i> (i. e. a man) <i>inclining,</i> or <i>leaning,</i> [or <i>bending down, so as as to elude his observation,</i> i. e.] <i>so that he</i> [the latter] <i>did not see him, and was not cognizant of him.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  [And it is said in the TA that غَيَنُوا النَّاسَ means <i>None but they obtained it:</i> whence it appears that فِيهِ or the like has been omitted after النَّاسَ: with this addition, the phrase may be rendered, <i>they overreached,</i> or <i>prevented, the</i> other <i>people in respect of it, by obtaining it themselves.</i>] ―         -b4-  هٰذَا يَغْبِنُ عَقْلَكَ, said to a man whom another had cheated (غَبَنَ) in a sale, means <i>This</i> [man] <i>attributes defect,</i> or <i>imperfection, to thy intellect.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  قَدْ غَبَنُوا <br>\

      مَغْبُونَةٌ, [i. e.] one <i>of which the qualities are not known to be as above mentioned.</i> (ISh, TA.) ―         -b6-  غَبَنْتَ رَاْيَكَ [if not a mistranscription for غَبِنْتَ (see غَبِنَ رَاْيَهُ in what follows)] means <i>Thou hast lost,</i> and <i>forgotten, thy judgment,</i> or <i>opinion.</i> (TA.) ―         -b7-  غَبِنَ الشَّيَْ and فِى الشَّيْ, aor.      <br>\
                     غَبَنَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. غَبْنٌ and غَبَنٌ, signify <i>He forgot the thing:</i> or <i>he was unmindful, neglectful,</i> or <i>heedless, of it;</i> (K, TA;) and <i>ignorant of it:</i> (TA:) or <i>he made a mistake in respect of it;</i> (K, TA;) as in the saying, غَبِنَ كَذَا مِنْ حَقِّهِ عِنْدَ <br>\
                  فُلَانٍ [<i>he made a mistake in respect of such a thing, of his right,</i> or <i>due, to be required at the hand of such a one</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b8-  غَبِنَ رَاْيَهُ, inf. n. غَبَنٌ (S, Msb, K) and غَبَانَةٌ, (S, * K,) means <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, deficient in his judgment,</i> or <i>opinion:</i> (S:) or <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, weak</i> [<i>therein</i>]: (K:) or <i>his intelligence,</i> or <i>sagacity,</i> and <i>his sharpness,</i> or <i>acuteness, of mind, went away:</i> (Msb:) the parsing of this phrase has been [fully] expl. voce سَفِهَ [q. v.]. (S.)       -A2-  غَبَنَ الثَّوْبَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) inf. n. غَبْنٌ, (K,) from مَغْبِنٌ [q. v.], (Msb,) <i>He folded,</i> or <i>doubled, the garment,</i> (T, Mgh, Msb, K, * TA,) it being [too] long.

                  <i>He folded,</i> or <i>doubled,</i> [<i>the edge of</i>] <i>the leathern bucket, to shorten it.</i> (TA: but only the inf. n. of the verb thus used is there mentioned.) ―         -b2-  And غَبَنَ الشَّيْ <br>\
                  <i>He hid,</i> or <i>concealed, the thing in the</i> <br>\
                  مَغْبِن [or <i>armpit</i> or <i>groin</i> or <i>the like</i>]; (TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
      اغتبنهُ. (K, TA.) غَبَنَ الطَّعَامَ is like خَبَنَهُ [i. e. <i>He concealed, kept,</i> or <i>stored, wheat,</i> or <i>food, for a time of dearth,</i> or <i>adversity.</i>] (S.)    </entryFree> <br>\

      مُغَابَنَةٌ signifies the same; or <i>mutual endeavoring to cheat</i> &amp;amp;c: see 3 in art زبن]. (S, MA, K, KL, TA.) Hence, يَوْمُ التَّغَابُنِ [in the Kur lxiv. 9], an appellation of <i>The day of resurrection;</i> because the people of Paradise will then overreach (تَغْبِنُ) the people of Hell, (S, K, TA,) by the state of enjoyment in which the former will become and the punishment which the latter will experience; or, as El-Hasan says, because the former will attribute defect, or imperfection, to the intellects of the latter by reason of the preferring infidelity to faith.
