                  , (S, A, K,) or غَمَزَهُ بِيَدِهِ, (Msb,) aor.      <br>\
                     غَمِزَ<br>\
                  , (Msb, K,) inf. n. غَمْزٌ, (TA,) <i>He felt him,</i> (namely, a ram,) <i>to know if he were fat:</i> (S, A, Msb, K:) and غَمَزَهَا <br>\
                  <i>he put his hand upon her</i> (a camel&#39;s) <i>back, to see how fat she was.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  Hence, (Msb,) غَمَزَهُ بِيَدِهِ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.      <br>\
                     غَمِزَ<br>\
                  , (K,) inf. n. غَمْزٌ, (A, K,) <i>He pressed,</i> or <i>squeezed, it,</i> [<i>with his hand,</i>] namely, a limb, (A, K, TA,) and a man&#39;s back. (TA.) So in a trad. of &#39;Omar: دَخَلَ عَلَيْهِ وَعِنْدَهُ غُلَيْمٌ يَغْمِزُ ظَهْرَهُ [<i>He went in to him, and with him was a little boy pressing,</i> or <i>squeezing,</i> or <i>kneading, his back</i>]. (TA.) And in a trad. respecting the ablution termed الغُسْل, it is said, اِغْمِزِى قُرُونَكِ, meaning <i>Press thou,</i> or <i>squeeze thou, the locks of thy hair,</i> in washing. (TA.) You also say, غَمَزَ الثِّقَافُ القَنَاةَ <br>\
                  <i>The straightening-instrument pinched and pressed the spear.</i> (A, * Mgh, TA. *) A poet (namely Ziyád El-Aajam, TA) says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَكُنْتُ اـِذَا غَمَزْتُ قَنَاةَ قَوْمٍ<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        كَسَرْتُ كُعُوبَهَا اَوْ تَسْتَقِيمَا<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>And I used, when I pinched and pressed the spear of a people, to break its knots,</i> or <i>internodal portions, unless it became straight</i>]. (S, TA. It is a prov., respecting which see remarks in art. او.)       -A2-  غَمَزَ, (A, Msb,) and غَمَزَهُ, (S, Mgh, K,) aor.      <br>\
                     غَمِزَ<br>\
                  , (Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. غَمْزٌ, (Msb, TA,) (tropical:)  <i>He made a sign,</i> (A, Msb,) and <i>he made a sign to him,</i> (Mgh, K, *) with the eye, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) or eyebrow, (A, Mgh, Msb, K,) or eyelid [by winking]. (K.) So in the saying, in a trad., غَمَزَنِى عَلِىٌّ اَنْ قُلْ نَعَمْ (tropical:)  &#39;4<i>lee made a sign to me</i> with the eye, or eyebrow, <i>meaning, Say thou Yes.</i> (Mgh.) The people of the West say, غَمَزَهُ فُلَانٌ بِفُلَانٍ, meaning, (tropical:)  <i>Such a one blinked towards such a one, to instigate him against him,</i> or <i>in order that he should have recourse to him for protection or the like,</i> or <i>seek aid of him.</i> (Mgh.) ―         -b2-  Hence, الغَمْزُ بِالنَّاسِ: (S:) you say, غَمَزَ بِالرَّجُلِ, aor.      <br>\
                     غَمِزَ<br>\
                  , (K,) inf. n. غَمْزٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  <i>He calumniated,</i> or <i>slandered, the man.</i> (K.) [See also 4.] ―         -b3-  You say also, غُمِزَتْ شَهَادَتَهُ <br>\
                   [(assumed tropical:)  <i>His testimony was suspected</i> (see مَغْمُوزٌ), or <i>impugned</i>]. (TA in art. زور.)       -A3-  غَمَزَتِ الدَّابَّةُ, (K,) or غَمَزَ فِى مَشْيِهِ, (Msb,) or مِنْ رِجْلِهِ, (S,) aor.      <br>\
                     غَمِزَ<br>\
                  , (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. غَمْزٌ, (S, Msb,) (assumed tropical:)  <i>The beast limped,</i> or <i>it halted, with its hind leg; had a slight lameness thereof:</i> (K, * TA:) or <i>he had what resembled</i> <br>\
                  عَرَج [or <i>natural lameness</i>] <i>in his gait:</i> (Msb:) or, as IKtt says, غَمَزَتِ الدَّابَّةُ بِرِجْلِهَا <br>\
                  <i>the beast gave an indication of a limping,</i> or <i>halting,</i> or <i>slight lameness, in its hind leg:</i> whence it appears that this signification may be tropical. (TA.)       -A4-  غَمَزَ said of a disease, or of a vice, or fault, of a man, <i>It appeared.</i> (AA, K.)       -A5-  See also 4.    </entryFree> <br>\

                   [This verb is mentioned by Golius as <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  عايب, a verb for which I find no authority: and Freytag renders it “ Vitii arguit, ” and refers to a passage in Har (p. 427 of the see. ed.) where (like as is done by Golius) المُغامِز and المُعايِب, as syn., are erroneously put for المَغامِز and المَعايِب.]    </entryFree> <br>\

      غَمُوزٌ, applied to her. (TA.)       -A2-  اغمز فِى فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  <i>He blamed,</i> or <i>found fault with, such a one; attributed</i> or <i>imputed to him,</i> or <i>charged him with,</i> or <i>accused him of, a vice,</i> or <i>fault;</i> (S, IKtt, K, TA;) <i>deemed him weak;</i> (TA;) <i>lessened his rank,</i> or <i>dignity:</i> (S, IKtt, K, * TA:) <i>he found in him that for which he should be deemed weak:</i> (A, TA:) and ↓ <br>\

                  <i>he impugned his character; blamed him; censured him;</i> or <i>spoke against him.</i> (K.) You say, فُلَانٌ ↓ <br>\

      غَمَزَنِى <br>\
                  الحَرُّ, on the authority of AA: (TA:) and AA mentioned اغمرنى الحرّ in this sense, but afterwards doubted, and said, I think that it is with زاى. (TA in art. غمر.) ―         -b2-  And اَغْمَزَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He</i> (a man) <i>became gentle, so that others were emboldened against him.</i> (IKtt, TA.)       -A4-  And اَغْمَزَ [for which اَغْمَزَه is erroneously put in the CK] <i>He acquired cattle such as are termed</i> <br>\

                  مقرع is an inf. n., or means “ a place of beating, ” and صفاة is “ a rock; ” and the above-mentioned use of these two words is borrowed from the phrase قَرَعَ صَفَاتَهُ, meaning (tropical:)  “ he impugned his character; blamed, or censured, him; or spoke against him. ” (Mgh.) ―         -b3-  See also غَمِيزَةٌ, in five places.    </entryFree> <br>\
