<b>غوّث</b>               1     <br>\
                     غوّث<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  , (S, K,) inf. n. تَغْوِيثٌ; (K;) and ↓ <br>\
      استغاث; (TA;) <i>He cried out,</i> (TA,) <i>and said,</i> (S, K,) ↓ <br>\
      وَا غَوْثَاهُ (S, K, TA) [<i>Alas! a cry for aid,</i> or <i>succour!</i> also pronounced وا غَوْثَاهِ (accord.  to one of my copies of the S) and وا غَوْثَاهْ]. You say, ضُرِبَ فُلَانٌ فَغَوَّثَ <br>\
                  <i>Such a one was beaten, and cried</i> <br>\
                  وا غوثاه. (TA.) This is declared by the leading grammarians to be the primary signification of غوّث: then they used it as meaning <i>He cried out,</i> or <i>called, desiring,</i> or <i>demanding, aid,</i> or <i>succour.</i> (MF.)       -A2-  See also غَوِيثٌ.    </entryFree> <br>\

      مَغُوثَةٌ [which is anomalous], (K,) <i>He aided,</i> or <i>succoured, him;</i> (Msb;) <i>He</i> (i. e. God, Msb) <i>removed from him trouble,</i> or <i>affliction:</i> (Msb, TA:) ↓ <br>\
      غَاثَهُ, aor. يَغِيثُهُ, is used in the sense of اغاثهُ, but is rare, and is said [by some] to be from الغَيْثُ, not الاـِغَاثَةُ: غاثهُ, aor. يَغُوثُهُ, is mentioned by Az as not heard by him from any one; but ISd mentions غاثهُ, inf. n. غَوْثٌ and غِيَاثٌ, though saying that اغاثهُ is more approved. (TA.) And one says also, اَغَاثَنَا المَطَرُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>The rain gave us relief</i>]. (Msb.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                  , accord. to Freytag, appears to be used in the Deewán of the Hudhalees as signifying <i>They said, one to another,</i> <br>\
                  وَا غَوْثَاهُ:       -A2-  and تغاوث as <i>syn. with</i> <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                  , (S, O, Msb, K,) and استغاث بِهِ, (O, Msb, TA,) the latter disallowed by some, but used by Sb, (TA,) <i>He sought, desired,</i> or <i>demanded, aid,</i> or <i>succour, of,</i> or <i>by means of, him,</i> or <i>it; he sought,</i> &amp;amp;c., [or <i>called for,</i>] <i>his aid,</i> or <i>succour.</i> (O, MF, TA.) ―         -b2-  See also 2.

      دُعَا=ءَهُ وغُوَاثَهُ and ↓ <br>\
      غَوَاثَهُ [<i>God answered his prayer, and his cry for aid</i>]. (Fr, S.) ↓ <br>\
      غَوَاثٌ is said by Fr to be the only word significant of a sound, or cry, having fet-h [to the first letter]; other words of this kind being with damm, as بُكَا=ءٌ and دُعَا=ءٌ, or with kesr, as نِدَا=ءٌ and صِيَاحٌ. (S.) See also 2. ―         -b2-  And see غِيَاثٌ.    </entryFree> <br>\

In the T, الغِيَاثُ is expl. as signifying <i>That with which God aids,</i> or <i>succours, one.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  And غِيَاثٌ signifies also <i>An aider,</i> or <i>a succourer:</i> you say, فُلَانٌ غِيَاثُنَا <br>\

      مُغِيثُنَا: (TA in art. نور:) and God is said to be غِيَاثُ المُسْتَغِيثِينَ [<i>The Aider of the seekers of aid</i>]. (O.) ―         -b3-  [Hence,] اُمُّ غِيَاثٍ is a name for (assumed tropical:)  <i>The cooking-pot.</i> (T in art. ام.)    </entryFree> <br>\
