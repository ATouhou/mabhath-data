      مُغْزَلٌ is the original form, from اُغْزِلَ “ it was made to turn round ” or “ revolve ” [or “ was twirled ”]; (S, TA;) but the dammeh was deemed by the Arabs difficult of pronunciation, and therefore they said مِغْزَلٌ, and in like manner مِصْحَفٌ and مِخْدَعٌ and مِجْسَدٌ and مِطْرَفٌ: accord. to IAth, مِغْزَلٌ signifies the <i>instrument</i> [<i>with which one spins</i>]; and ↓ <br>\

(MA.) اَعْرى مِنْ مِغْزَلٍ is a prov. [meaning <i>More naked than a spindle</i>]. (Meyd.) And one says, صَاحِبُ الغَزَلِ اَضَلُّ مِنْ سَاقِ مِغْزَلٍ [<i>The practiser of the talk and actions</i> &amp;amp;c. <i>usual between the lover and the object of love is more erring than the shank</i> (i. e. <i>pin</i>) <i>of a spindle</i>), of which the error is its [aiding in] clothing mankind while it is [itself] naked.

                  وَكَذَا وَرُبْعُ المِغْزَلِ, meaning [<i>I pon you lie as due from you such and such things and</i>) <i>the fourth part of what your women have spun.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  And [the pl.] مَغَازِلُ signifies The عَمَد (O) or عُمُد (K) [app. meaning the <i>upright wooden supports of the seat</i>] <i>of the</i> [<i>machine called</i>] نَوْرَج [q. v.] <i>with which the reaped grain heaped together is thrashed.</i> (O, K.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>A slender cord</i> (حَبْلٌ دَقِيقٌ) [so in copies of the K, and in the CK, but in the latter المُغْتَزَلُ is put for المُغَيْزِلُ: in my MS. copy of the K, المُغَيْزِلُ جَبَلٌ دَقِيقٌ, and this I think to be the correct reading. meaning <i>El-Mugheyzil is a certain slender mountain</i>]: ISd says, I think it to be likened to the مِغْزَل, because of its slenderness; adding that El-Hirmázee has mentioned it. (TA. [A verse cited by El-Hirmázee is there  given as an ex.; mentioning the day of المُغَيْزِل, app. as the day of the separation of a lover from his beloved; and it is a common custom of the Arabs to call the day of an event the day of the place where it occurred.])    </entryFree> <br>\
