      مَيْتٌ signifies One <i>who has died</i> (actually, TA,); and مَيِّتٌ, as also ↓ <br>\
      مَايِتٌ, one <i>who has not yet died,</i> (K,) <i>but who is near to dying:</i> or, accord. to a verse cited by AA, to Kh, مَيْتٌ is applied to him <i>who is borne to the grave;</i> [i. e., who is <i>dead,</i> or <i>lifeless</i>]; and مَيِّتٌ, to him <i>who</i> [<i>is dying, but</i>] <i>has life in him.</i> (TA.) Fr says, you say of him who has not died, اـِنَّهُ مَايِتٌ, عَنْ قَلِيلٍ ↓ and مَيِّتٌ; but you do not say of him who has died ↓ <br>\
      هذا مَايِتٌ: (S:) but some say, that this is an error, and that مَيِّتٌ is applicable to that <i>which will soon die.</i> Those who assert that ميّت is applicable only to the living adduce the following words of the Kur, [xxxix. 31,] اـِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ وَاـِنَّهُمْ مَيِّتُونَ: (TA:) i. e. <i>Verily thou wilt die, and verily they will die.</i> (Msb.) MF observes, that مَيْتٌ is asserted to be contracted from مَيِّتٌ; and if so, that there can be no difference in their meanings: that the making a difference between them is contrary to analogy; agreeably with which, they should be like هَيْنٌ and هَيِّنٌ, and لَيْنٌ and لَيِّنٌ: and also contrary to what has been heard from the Arabs; for they made no difference in their use of these two words. (TA.) [See also what is said of مَيْتَةٌ, below.] The pls. are اَمْوَاتٌ and مَوْتَى and مَيِّتُونَ and مَيْتُونَ. (S, K.) The first of these is pl. of مَيِّتٌ, and consequently of مَيْتٌ, because this latter is contracted from the former: as مَيِّتٌ is of the measure فَيْعِلٌ, and this measure resembles فَاعِلٌ, it has received a form of pl. which is sometimes applicable to the measure فاعل: (Sb:) or اموات is [only] pl. of مَيْتٌ. (Msb.) [The second form (which is applied to rational beings, Msb,) is also pl. of ميّت and ميت.] The third and fourth are [only] applied to rational beings. (Msb.) The fem. epithet is مَيِّتَةٌ and مَيْتَةٌ and مَيِّتٌ (K, TA) and مَيْتٌ. (TA; and so in some copies of the K, in the place of مَيِّتٌ.) مَيِّتَةٌ is an epithet applied to a female rational being; [and its pl. is مَيِّتَاتٌ:] مَيْتَةٌ, to a female brute, for the sake of distinction; and its pl. is مَيْتَاتٌ: the latter is contracted because it is more in use than the former epithet applied to a female rational being: (Msb:) the pl. of ميّت and ميت as fem. epithets is as above [اَمْوَاتٌ and مَوْتَى]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  ↓ <br>\
      مَيْتَةٌ signifies <i>That which has not been slaughtered</i> (AA, S, K) [<i>in the manner prescribed by the law,</i> i. e., <i>carrion</i>]: or <i>that of which the life has departed without slaughter:</i> so in the classical language and in the language of practical law: all such is unlawful to be eaten, except fish and locusts, which are lawful by universal consent of the Muslims: (En-Nawawee:) or, in the common acceptation of the language of law, <i>what has died a natural death,</i> or <i>been killed in a state</i> or <i>manner different from that prescribed by the law, either the agent or the animal killed not being such as is so prescribed;</i> as that which is sacrificed to an idol, or slaughtered [by a person] in the state of اـِحْرَام, or not by having the throat cut, and that which it is unlawful to eat, such as a dog: (Msb:) [and <i>any separated part of an animal of which the flesh is not lawful food:</i> see عَاجٌ.] ―         -b3-  بَلَدٌ مَيِّتٌ <br>\
                  <i>A tract of land without herbage,</i> or <i>pasture,</i> (Msb, in art. بلد.) ―         -b4-  مَيِّتٌ (assumed tropical:)  <i>An unbeliever;</i> like as حَىٌّ means a Muslim. (TA, in art. حى.)    </entryFree> <br>\
