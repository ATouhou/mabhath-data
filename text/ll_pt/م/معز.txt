                  , and ↓ <br>\
      مَعَزٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) gen. ns., (S, Msb,) [or rather quasi-pl. ns., signifying <i>Goats;</i>] the <i>kind of</i> <br>\
                  غَنَم <br>\
                  <i>opposed to</i> <br>\

                  <i>that have hair;</i> (Msb, TA;) the ضاْن being those that have wool; (TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
      مِعْزًى, (S, Msb, K,) accord. to Sb, (S,) with tenween, (S, Msb,) when indeterminate, (Msb,) and perfectly decl., (S,) the ا [which is written ى] being a letter of quasicoördination, not a characteristic of the fem. gender, (S, Msb,) for the word is quasi-coördinate to دِرْهَمٌ, of the measure فِعْلَلٌ; for the ا of quasi-coördination follows the same rules as a letter belonging to the word itself, as is shown by their saying ↓ <br>\
      مُعَيْزٍ and اُرَيْطٍ [originally مُعَيْزِىٌ and اُرَيْطِىٌ] as the dim. forms of مِعْزًى and اَرْطًى with tenween, the letter next after the ى of diminution being with kesr, like as they say دُرَيْهِمٌ; for if the ا were to denote the fem. gender they would not change it into ى [in مُعَيْزِىٌ, the original form of مُعَيْزٍ,] like as they do not change it in the dims. of حُبْلَى and اَخْرَى [which are حُبَيْلَى and اُخَيْزَى]: (S:) it is sometimes made fem., [by being written or pronounced مِعْزَاةٌ,] and sometimes it is made imperfectly decl. [and therefore without tenween]: (K:) Fr says, that it is [itself] fem., but that some make it masc. [and therefore with tenween]: but A &#39;Obeyd says, that most of the Arabs pronounce ذِفْرَى without tenween, while some of them pronounce it with tenween, whereas all of them pronounce مِعْزًى with tenween: (S:) IAar says, that it is perfectly decl. when likened to the measure مِفْعَلٌ, and imperfectly decl. when held to accord. with the measure فِعْلَى: (TA:) accord. to Aboo-&#39;Amr, Ibn-El-&#39;Alà, it is from مَعَزٌ, [inf. n. of مَعِزَ,] and in like manner ذِفْرَى is from ذَفَرٌ: (As, S:) ↓ <br>\
      مَعِيزٌ also signifies the same as مَعْزٌ, (S, A, K,) or is pl. of مَعْزٌ, [or rather a quasi-pl. n.] like as عَبِيدٌ is of عَبْدٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ <br>\
      اُمْعُوزٌ also is syn. with مَعْزٌ, (S, K,) and so are ↓ <br>\
      مِعَازٌ (K) and ↓ <br>\
      مِعْزَا=ءٌ: (Sgh, K:) [respecting اُمْعُوزٌ, see also below:] مَعْزٌ [as well as its syns. mentioned above, like all quasi-pl. ns., is sometimes masc., but generally] is fem.: (Msb:) a male is called ↓ <br>\
      مَاعِزٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) and so a female; (Msb, K;) or a female is called ↓ <br>\
      مَاعِزَةٌ (S, A, TA) [and ↓ <br>\
      مَعْزَةٌ (M, voce شَرْقَا=ءُ)] and ↓ <br>\
      مِعْزَاة; (TA;) and شَاةٌ [or rather شَاةٌ مِنَ المَعْزِ] is also used as a sing., (Msb,) and is applied to a male and to a female: (Msb, art. شوه:) [see also ظَبْىٌ:] اَمْعُزٌ is a pl. [of pauc.] of مَعْزٌ, like as اَعْبُدٌ is of عَبْدٌ: (Msb:) the pl. of ↓ <br>\
      مَاعِزٌ, (K,) or of مَاعِزَةٌ, (S,) is مَوَاعِزُ; (S, K;) and ↓ <br>\
      مِعَازٌ and ↓ <br>\
      اُمْعُوزٌ are said to be quasi-pl. ns. (TA.) The goats of the Arabs of the desert have short hair, not long enough to be spun; but the goats of the cold countries, and of the people of the fertile regions, have abundant hair, and of this the Akrád [or Kurds] fabricate their tents.
