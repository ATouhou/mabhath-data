                  , (A, Mgh,) first pers. مَسِسْتُهُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) for which they sometimes say مِسْتُهُ, rejecting the first س, (Sb, * S, M, * K,) and transferring the kesreh thereof to the م (Sb, * S, M, *) contr. to general rule, (Sb, M,) and some do not transfer the kesreh, but leave the م with its fethah, [saying مَسْتُهُ,] like ظِلْتُمْ and ظَلْتُمْ for ظَلِلْتُمْ, an irregular contraction, (S,) aor. يَمَسُّهُ, (S, Msb, K,) [and يَمْسَسْهُ when mejzoom, accord. to rule,] inf. n. مَسٌّ (S, M, A, Msb, K) and مَسِيسٌ, (S, * M, A, K,) or the latter is a simple subst., (Msb,) and مِسِّيسَى; (S, * K;) and [مَسَّهُ,] first pers. مَسَسْتُهُ; aor. يَمُسُّهُ, (AO, S, M, Msb, K,) inf. n. مَسٌّ; (Msb;) the former of which two verbs is the more chaste; (S, TA;) <i>He touched it,</i> or <i>felt it,</i> [generally the former,] syn. لَمَسَهُ, (M, A, K,) <i>with his hand:</i> (TA: as from the K [but wanting in a MS copy of the K and in the CK:]) or <i>he put his hand to it without the intervention of anything:</i> (Msb:) or مَسٌّ is like لَمْسٌ; excepting that the latter is [sometimes] used to signify the seeking for [or feeling for] a thing, even though it be not found; whereas the former is [only] said of that [<i>action</i>] <i>with which is perception by the sense of</i> <br>\
                  لمس: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [see also لَمَسَهُ:] and [in like manner you say,] مَاسَّ الشَّىْءُ الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. مُمَاسَّةٌ and مِسَاسٌ, (M, A, *) meaning, <i>the thing met</i> [or <i>touched</i>] <i>the thing with its substance.</i> (M.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] مَسَّهَا, (M, A, Msb,) first pers. مَسِسْتُهَا, aor. يَمَسُّهَا, (Msb,) inf. n. مَسٌّ and مَسِيسٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) (tropical:)  <i>Inivit eam;</i> scil. mulierem; (M, A, Msb;) as also ↓ <br>\
      مَاسَّهَا, (M, A, Msb,) inf. n. مُمَاسَّةٌ (S, Msb) and مِسَاسٌ: (Msb:) the former is used in this sense in several places in the Kur, and is said by some to be preferable to the latter: (TA:) and تَمَاسٌّ is also used metonymically for [the <i>coming together, in the sense of</i>] مُبَاضَعَةٌ, as well as مُمَاسَّةٌ. (S.) ―         -b3-  مَسَّ المَا=ءُ <br>\
                  الجَسَدَ, inf. n. مَسٌّ, (tropical:)  <i>The water wetted the body.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b4-  مَسَّ also signifies (tropical:)  <i>He</i>, or <i>it, struck,</i> or <i>smote;</i> because striking, or smiting, like touching, is with the hand. (TA.) You say, مَسَّهُ <br>\
                  بِالسَّوْطِ (tropical:)  <i>He struck him with the whip</i>]. (A.) ―         -b5-  And it is said of anything annoying or hurtful that befals a man. Thus in the Kur, [ii. 74, and iii. 23,] لَنْ تَمَسَّنَا النَّارُ (tropical:)  [<i>The fire</i> of hell <i>will not smite us;</i> or here it may be rendered <i>touch us</i>]. And [ii. 210,] مَسَّتْهُمُ البَاْسَا=ءُ [<i>Distress,</i> or <i>misfortune, smote,</i> or <i>afflicted,</i> or <i>befell, them</i>]. And in other instances; all which are similar to the saying in the same, ذُوقُوا مَسَّ سَقَرَ. (TA.) [See مَسٌّ below.] You say also, مَسَّهُ المَرَضُ (tropical:)  [<i>Sickness smote him,</i> or <i>befell him</i>]: and مَسَّهُ <br>\
                  العَذَابُ (tropical:)  [<i>Punishment befell him</i>]: and مَسَّهُ الكِبَرُ (tropical:)  [<i>Old age came upon him</i>]. (A.) And مَسَّتْهُ <br>\
                  الجِنُّ (tropical:)  [lit. <i>The jinn,</i> or <i>genii touched him;</i> meaning, <i>affected him with madness,</i> or <i>insanity</i>]: (TA:) [whence,] مُسَّ, [in the TA, مُسَّ بِهِ, app. meaning, from what immediately precedes, مُسَّ <br>\
                  بِالجُنُونِ, inf. n. مَسٌّ,] <i>He was,</i> or <i>became,</i> [<i>touched with madness,</i> or <i>insanity:</i> or] <i>mad,</i> or <i>insane:</i> (K:) as though the jinn had touched him. (TA.) And مَسَّهُ بِعَذَابٍ (tropical:)  <i>He punished him.</i> (TA, from a trad.) ―         -b6-  [Hence, app.,] مَسَّتْ اـِلَيْهِ الحَاجَةُ, (S, K,) inf. n. [مَسٌّ and] مَسِيسٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  [which seems to signify either <i>The want of him,</i> or <i>it, was difficult of accomplishment,</i> or <i>distressing;</i> or <i>the want was difficult of accomplishment,</i> or <i>distressing, to him</i>]. (S, K,. [In both these lexicons, the meaning is left to be inferred only from the fact that this phrase immediately follows the explanation of حَاجَةٌ مَاسَّةٌ, <i>q. v.</i>]) ―         -b7-  [مَسَّ is also said of what is good, as well as of what is evil; as in the following instance:] مَسَّتْهُ مَوَاسُّ <br>\
                  الخَيْرِ وَالشَّرِّ (tropical:)  [<i>The haps of good fortune, and of evil,</i>] <i>happened to him,</i> or <i>betided him.</i> (TA.) ―         -b8-  [As touching implies proximity,] مَسَّتْ بِكَ رَحِمُ <br>\
                  فُلَانٍ signifies (tropical:)  <i>The relationship of such a one is near to you.</i> (S, K, * TA.) ―         -b9-  And as مَسَّ originally signifies “ he touched or felt with the hand, ” it is used metaphorically as meaning (tropical:)  <i>He took</i> a thing; as, for instance, (in a trad.,) water from a مِيضَاَة. (TA.)       -A2-  مَسَّ is made doubly trans. by means of the prep. بِ prefixed to the second objective complement. (Msb.) See 4, in two places.    </entryFree> <br>\

                  مُبَاضَعَة: (S, Msb, * K: *) in this sense the verb is used in the Kur, lviii. 4 and 5. (S, TA.) See also مَسَّهَا.    </entryFree> <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                  : see 1. ―         -b2-  It is used to denote [the first sensible effect of] anything annoying or hurtful that befalls a man. (TA.) Thus in the Kur, [liv. 48,] (TA,) ذُوقُوا مَسَّ سَقَرَ (tropical:)  <i>Taste ye the first effect upon you of the fire of hell:</i> (K, TA:) or <i>the stroke thereof:</i> (Jel:) or <i>the heat and pain thereof.</i> (Bd.) In like manner you say, (K,) وَجَدَ مَسَّ الحُمَّى (M, K) (tropical:)  <i>He felt the commencement,</i> or <i>first touch,</i> [or <i>access,</i>] <i>of fever, before its taking him forcibly, and becoming apparent.</i> (M, L.)

                  الجُنُونِ (tropical:)  [<i>In him is a touch,</i> or <i>stroke, of madness,</i> or <i>insanity,</i> or <i>diabolical possession</i>]: (S, TA:) and مَسٌّ, alone, signifies <i>madness,</i> or <i>insanity,</i> or <i>diabolical possession:</i> (M, A, * Mgh, K:) as in the Kur, ii. 276: (TA:) and you say بِهِ مَسٌّ <br>\
                  <i>in him is madness,</i> &amp;amp;c.: (A, * Mgh:) for they assert that the devil touches one and his intellect in consequence becomes confused.

      لَا مِسَاسَ, in the Kur, [ubi supra,] (S, M, K,) accord. to the reading of others, (M,) signifies <i>There shall be no mutual touching:</i> (M:) or <i>I will not touch nor will I be touched.</i> (S, K.)    </entryFree> <br>\
