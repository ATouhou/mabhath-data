Abu-l-Kásim Er-Zejjájee disapproves of this, saying that a verb of this form is only derived from an inf. n., as in the cases of ضَارَبَ and قَاتَلَ; whereas this is derived from مِلْحٌ, a subst. [But his objection seems to me invalid: this may be an anomalous instance, and yet of classical authority, like many others.] ―         -b2-  مَالَحَهُ, inf. n. مُمَالَحَةٌ and مِلَاحٌ, (tropical:)  <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, his foster-brother.</i> (L, TA.) [المِلَاحُ is explained in the K by المُرَاضَعَةُ: Lth explaines it by الرَّضَاعُ, as is mentioned in the TA: المُمَالَحَةُ is explained in the A, Mgh, L, and other lexicons by المُرَاضَعَةُ: in the copies of the K in my hands, by الرَّضَاعُ; and so in one copy of the S: in another copy of the S written الرِّضَاعُ; and in another الرّضَاع, without any vowel to the ر: الرضَاعُ, syn. with المُرَاضَعَةُ, is evidently the right reading.] Abu-l-Kásim Er-Zejjájee disapproves of the verb used as signifying the act of two men&#39;s sucking each other; [but this is not what is meant by المراضعة;] and pronounces it a post-classical word.

(TA.) This is said accord. to the doctrine of the Basrees, who assert the افعل of wonder to be a verb: but as to the Koofees, who say that it is a noun, [meaning an epithet,] they allow the formation of the dim. from it without restriction; and from its admitting the dim. form, they argue that it is a noun.

(Abu-l- Kásim Ez-Zejjájee.) ―         -b2-  مِلْحٌ (tropical:)  <i>Milk.</i> (IAar.) The following verse of Abu-t-Tamahán, who had some camels, of the milk whereof he gave to drink to a people that afterwards made an attack upon them, and took them, is cited by As, [app., accord. to the S, as an ex. of ملح in the sense of رَضَاع; but as MF observes, it may be taken as an ex. of that word in the sense of milk;] <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> (S, L.) The poet says, Verily I hope that ye may regard (اَنْ تَرْعَوْا [which is understood]) the milk which ye have drank, of these camels, [lit., their milk in your bellies,] and the skins which they have expanded, of a people with matted and dusty hair, and of a dusty hue; as though their skins had dried up, and they had fattened upon them. [Another explanation will be noticed below.] IB says, that the last word should be read اَغْبَرِ, for the sake of the rhyme; for each verse of the poem to which it belongs ends with kesreh. (L.)       -A2-  مِلْحٌ a thing well known, (S, K,) [<i>Salt;</i>] <i>that with which food is made pleasant:</i> (L:) of the fem. gender (Z) generally; (O;) sometimes masc.: (K:) pl. مِلَاحٌ. (Msb.)

      مَلِحْ, from the verb مَلُحَ, like خَشِنٌ from خَشُنَ, contracted because of the frequency of its usage; (Msb;) and ↓ <br>\
      ماء مَلِيحٌ, (K,) and ↓ <br>\
      مَالِحٌ; (IAar, ADk, Az;) [respecting which last, see what will be found after the explanation;] <i>Salt water.</i> (S, K, &amp;amp;c.) J says, that مَاء مالح is not allowable, except in a bad dial.: but Az says, that, though rarely found in the language of the Arabs, it is not to be rejected; and IB says, that it occurs in verses of chaste poets; and may be considered as used after the manner of a rel. n., [meaning ذُو مِلْحٍ,] like رَجُلٌ تَارِسٌ, i. e. ذُو تُرْسٍ, and دَارِعٌ, i. e. ذُو دِرْعٍ: (TA:) it is a chaste word, of the dial. of El-Hijáz, but extr., being from اَمْلَحَ المَا=ءُ, like as you say بَاقِلٌ from اَبْقَلَ المَوْضِعُ; and when it is said that it is rare, it is meant that it is not agreeable with its verb, not that it is rare with respect to usage, seeing that it is of the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, who selected the most chaste words of the various dialects: or it is regularly formed from مَلَحَ المَاءُ, a form of the verb sometimes used. (Msb.) The pl. of مِلْحٌ is مِلْحَةٌ and مِلَاحٌ and مِلَحٌ: (L, K:) and sometimes is said اَمْوَاهٌ مِلْحٌ <br>\
                  <i>salt waters;</i> and رَكِيَّةٌ مِلْحَةٌ <br>\
                  <i>a salt well.</i> (L.) ―         -b3-  مِلَاحٌ <br>\

      قَلِيبٌ مَليِحٌ <br>\
                  <i>A well of salt water:</i> (S, K:) pl. اَقْلِبَةٌ مِلَاحٌ, occurring in a verse of &#39;Antarah. (S.) ―         -b4-  مِلْحٌ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Knowledge; science; learning;</i> syn. عِلْمٌ. (IKh, Kz, K.) ―         -b5-  (assumed tropical:)  <i>Men of science; learned men;</i> syn. عُلَمَا=ءُ. (IKh, Kz, K.) ―         -b6-  (tropical:)  <i>Goodliness,</i> or <i>beauty.</i> (K.) [Accord. to the TA, it is an inf. n.: see مَلُحَ.] ―         -b7-  (tropical:)  <i>Fat,</i> as a subst. (Sh, K.) ―         -b8-  (tropical:)  <i>Fatness:</i> (K:) or <i>a small degree of fatness.</i> (TA.) ―         -b9-  مِلْحٌ and ↓ <br>\
      مِلْحَةٌ (tropical:)  <i>A sacred</i> or <i>inviolable bond,</i> or <i>the like,</i> or <i>any compact, bond,</i> or <i>obligation, which one is under an obligation to respect,</i> or <i>honour,</i> or <i>the cancelling</i> or <i>breaking of which renders one obnoxious to blame;</i> syn. حُرْمَةٌ and ذِمَامٌ; and <i>a compact,</i> or <i>confederacy;</i> syn. حِلْفٌ. (K.) In some copies of the K, for حِلْفٌ is put حَلفٌ. (TA.) ―         -b10-  Accord. to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, this is the signification of the former word in the verse of Abu-t-Tamahán cited above, and the poet means, I hope that God may punish you for your perfidious violation of the sacred obligation to their owner, which they imposed upon you. You say بَيْنَ فُلَانٍ وَفُلَانٍ مِلْحٌ, and ↓ <br>\
      مِلْحَةٌ, <i>There is a sacred</i> or <i>inviolable bond, &amp;amp;c., between such a one and such a one.</i> [This meaning is derived from مِلْحٌ as signifying “ salt; ” the eating of which with another imposes upon the two parties a sacred mutual obligation.] The Arabs, says Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, pay a high respect to salt and fire and ashes. (L.) [You say,] مِلْحُهُ عَلَى رُكْبَتِهِ, so in the copies of the K, but correctly على رُكْبَتَيْهِ, as in all the other lexicons, (TA,) (tropical:)  [lit., <i>His salt is upon his knees;</i>] meaning <i>he has no good faith, so as to fulfil his promises,</i> or <i>engagements:</i> (K:) or <i>he has little good faith, so as to fulfil his promises, &amp;amp;c.,</i> for the Arabs swear by salt, and by water, because of their respect for them: (IAar:) or <i>he violates the obligation imposed by such,</i> the smallest thing making him forget it, like as the least thing scatters salt if a person puts it upon his knees: (T:) or <i>he is fat:</i> (K:) As says, that in the following verse, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        لَا تَلُمْهَا اـِنَّهَا مِنْ نِسْوَةٍ<br>\

                  </quote> [<i>Blame her not; for she is of women whose fat is placed above the knees;</i>] the woman meant was of the people called Ez-Zenj, whose fat is in their thighs, and ملحها signifies their fat: (TA:) or <i>he is sharp in his anger:</i> (K:) or <i>he is of evil disposition, rendered angry by the least thing;</i> like as salt upon the knee is scattered by the least thing: (T:) or <i>he is frequently engaged in altercation;</i> as though his knees were much wounded by his long kneeling in altercation, and by his long striking his knees against those of another, and he therefore put salt upon them to cure them.
