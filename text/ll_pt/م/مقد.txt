                  <i>A certain kind of beverage, prepared from honey,</i> (S, L, K,) which the Khaleefehs of the sons of Umeyyeh used to drink: (L:) so called in relation to a town in Syria, (S, L,) called مَقَدٌ; or in relation to a town in Syria in the province of El-Urdunn: (L:) or this is a mistake; for the name of the town is with teshdeed [مَقَدٌّ]: IB says, that the orthography of the word as best known to the lexicologists is مَقَدِىٌّ, without teshdeed; but that A &#39;Obeyd and others write it with teshdeed; and that IAmb cites in confirmation of its being thus a verse of &#39;Amr Ibn-Maadeekerib, at the end of which occurs the expression شَغَلُوهُ عَنْ شَرْبِ المَقَدِّ; without ى; [app. for مَقَدِّى;] adding, that it is thus called in relation to مَقَدٌّ, a town of Damascus, in the mountain overlooking El-Ghór: (L:) A &#39;Obeyd says, I hold it to be correctly مَقَدِّىٌّ; and I heard Rejà Ibn-Selemeh explain this as signifying “ wine diminished to half its quantity by boiling; ” as though it were divided (قُدَّ) in halves: (Sh, L:) IB adds, that Aboo-t-Teyyib the lexicologist says, that the word in question is with د without teshdeed; from مَقَدٌ; and is only written with teshdeed by poetic licence: and in confirmation of this assertion, IB cites verses in which the name of the town and that of the beverage are written without teshdeed.
