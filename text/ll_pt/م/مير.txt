(M, arts. دفا and صيف; &amp;amp;c.) The first مِيرَة is the رِبْعِيَّة (M, arts. دفا and صيف,) which is the ميرة in the beginning of [the season called] the شِتَا=ء [or winter, i. e., in the latter part of December or in January, during the season of rains called الرَّبِيع, about which time, the species of millet called ذُرَة, which, as Niebuhr mentions, (Descr. de l&#39;Arabie, p. 135, note,) is called in El-Yemen طَعَام, is gathered in]: (S, K, art. ربع:) the second, the صَيْفِيَّة, (M, arts, دفا and صيف,) also called the صَايِفَة, (S, M, K, art. صيف,) which is the ميرة in [the season called] the صَيْف [or spring], (S, M, art. صيف,) in the first part of the صَيْف [i. e., in the latter part of March, about which time, wheat, and a second crop of millet (ذُرَة), and barley, are gathered in]: (M, art. صيف:) the third, the دَفَيِيَّة, (M, arts. دفا and صيف,) which is [also] in the first part of [the season called] the صَيْف [or spring, and consequently immediately after the صَيْفِيَّة, commencing in the season of the دَفَيِىّ rains, and app. continuing during part of April, when the same grains are gathered in; or by the صَيْف in this instance may be meant summer, but the more proper meaning is spring, and the term دَفَيِيَّةٌ seems already to point to the season of the دَفَيِىّ rains]: (M, art. دفا:) and the fourth, the رَمَضِيَّة, (M, arts. دفا and صيف,) which is the ميرة coming when the earth becomes burnt [by the sun, about July, when the month of رَمَضَان began at the period when the calendar by the months was fixed by Kiláb Ibn-Murrah, about two centuries before the Hijreh, and at which season of the year a third crop of ذُرَة is gathered in; for in some parts of Arabia they have three crops of this grain in the year; the second and third being sown immediately after, or produced by the grain which is let fall in cutting, the first and second].
