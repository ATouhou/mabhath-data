AZ mentions its signifying <i>Very sour</i> beverage or wine; as heard from the Kilábees. (TA.) You say also خَمْرَةٌ مُزَّةٌ, meaning, <i>Wine,</i> or <i>a wine in which is a taste between sweet and sour;</i> said to be from mixing unripe and ripe dates [in making it]: (TA:) or <i>wine in which is a sour taste,</i> (S, K,) <i>and in which is no goodness.</i> (S.)

                  <i>Wine having a pleasant, delicious,</i> or <i>sweet, taste:</i> (S, K, * TA:) so called because it bites, or burns, the tongue; (S, TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
      مُزٌّ, (K, TA,) which, however, is [not an epithet but] a subst.: (TA:) or the former signifies لذيذة المقطع [app. meaning <i>having a pleasant sharpness,</i> or <i>acidity</i>]: (so in the L, TA:) J says, that one should not say ↓ <br>\
      مِزَّةٌ, but this form is said to occur in one relation of a verse or El-Aashà. (TA.) See also مُزٌّ.       -A2-  Also مَزَّةٌ <br>\
