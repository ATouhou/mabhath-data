      مسّحهُ, inf. n تَمْسِيحٌ; <i>He wiped a thing</i> that was wet or dirty, <i>with his hand,</i> or <i>passed his hand over it to remove the wet</i> or <i>dirt that was upon it:</i> (L:) مَسْحٌ and تَمْسِيحٌ and ↓ <br>\
      تَمَسُّحٌ signifying the <i>passing the hand over a thing that is flowing</i> [<i>with water</i> or <i>the like</i>], or <i>dirtied, soiled,</i> or <i>polluted, to remove the fluid</i> or <i>dirt,</i> or <i>soil</i> or <i>pollution;</i> (L, K;) as when one wipes his head with his hand to remove water; and his forehead, to remove sweat. (L.) [It often signifies <i>He stroked a thing with his hand;</i> as, for instance, the Black Stone of the Kaabeh; see below.] ―         -b2-  مَسَحَ رَاْسَهُ مِنَ المَا=ءِ; and جَبِينَهُ <br>\
                  الرَّشَحِ; <i>He wiped his head with his hand to remove the water</i> that was upon it; and <i>his forehead to remove the sweat.</i> (L.) ―         -b3-  مَسَحَ بِرَاْسِهِ (S) <i>He wiped with his hand,</i> or <i>passed his hand closely over, his head,</i> or <i>a part thereof, without making any water to flow upon it:</i> so in the Kur, v. 8; where it is said, فَاْغْسِلُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ <br>\
                  وَاَيْدِيَكُمْ اـِلَى اْلْمَرَافِقِ وَاْمْسَحُوا بِرُوُوسِكُمْ وَاَرْجُلَكُمْ <br>\
                  اـِلَى اْلْكَعْبَيْنِ: here اَرْجُلَكُمْ is in the acc. case as an adjunct to ايديكم; [i.e., as a third objective complement to the verb اغسلوا; not as an adjunct to رووسكم;] but some read اَرْجُلِكُمْ, putting it in the gen. case because of its proximity to رووسكم; (Jel;) [in like manner as خَرِبٍ is put in the gen. case in the phrase هٰذَا جُحْرُ ضَبٍّ خَرِبٍ, an ex. given by many of the grammarians, showing that this is allowable in prose,] notwithstanding that it is said, by Aboo-Is-hák the grammarian, that the putting a noun in the gen. case because of its proximity to a preceding noun in that case is not allowable except in poetry, when necessity requires it: (L:) the head, which is wiped, is mentioned between the arms and the feet, which are washed, to show the order which is to be observed in the purification. (Jel.) But مَسَحَ signifies both <i>he wiped with the hand,</i> and also <i>he washed:</i> so says IAth: (L:) and AZ and IKt say the like: (Msb:) you say مَسَحْتُ يَدَىَّ <br>\
                  بالمَا=ءِ, meaning <i>I washed my hands with water.</i> (AZ, Msb.) ―         -b4-  مَسَحَ شَيْيًا بِالمَا=ءِ <br>\
                  <i>He wiped a thing with his hand wetted with water; passed his hand, wetted with water, over a thing.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b5-  مَسَحَ البَيْت <br>\
                  <i>He compassed the House</i> [<i>of God,</i> i.e. <i>the Kaabeh:</i> because he who does so passes his hand over the corner in which is the Black Stone]. (L.) ―         -b6-  مَسَحَ اْللّٰهُ عَنْكَ مَا بِكَ <br>\
                  <i>May God remove that which is in thee!</i> (L;) or, <i>wash and cleanse thee from thy sins!</i> (TA, art. مصح.) A prayer for a sick person. (L, from a trad.) ―         -b7-  مَسَحَهُ <br>\
