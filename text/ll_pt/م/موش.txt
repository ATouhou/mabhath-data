                  حِمَّص [or <i>chick-pea</i>], <i>of a tawny colour inclining to greenness; it is in Syria and India; and is sown;</i> (TA;) also called مَجٌّ and خُلَّرٌ and زِنٌّ: (TA, art. مج:) it is of moderate temperature; and the mixture made thereof is commended, being beneficial to him who is fevered, and him who is affected with rheum; it is lenitive; and when cooked with vinegar, it is beneficial for purulent pustulous mange or scab; and an external application thereof strengthens feeble limbs: (K:) the word is arabicized [from the Persian مَاشْ], or postclassical. (S.)       -A2-  <i>Utensils and furniture, of the meaner sort, of a house</i> or <i>tent.</i> (IAar, K.)

(TA.) And خَاشَ مَاشَ and خَاشِ مَاشِ signify the same as مَاشٌ thus used: (K, TA in art. خوش:) or the <i>refuse,</i> or <i>meanest sort, of people,</i> or <i>of mankind;</i> as in the M.
