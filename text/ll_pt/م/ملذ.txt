                  , inf. n. مَلْذٌ, <i>He was quick in coming and going.</i> (M, L.) This is the original signification. (L.) ―         -b2-  <i>He</i> (a horse) <i>was quick in his running.</i> (K, in which only the inf. n. is mentioned.) ―         -b3-  <i>He</i> (a-horse) <i>stretched forth his arms,</i> (مَذَّ ضَبْعَيْهِ, S, M, L, K,) <i>in running,</i> (S,) <i>to a degree that he could not exceed, to overtake,</i> (حَتَّى لَا يَجِدَ مَزِيدًا لِلِّحَاقٍ, M, L, K,) <i>and contracted,</i> or <i>drew in,</i> (حَبَسَ, [perhaps a mistake for خَنَسَ, which may mean either <i>contracted,</i> or <i>threw back,</i>]) <i>his hind legs to a degree that he could not exceed, to overtake, without any confusion</i> [<i>in his motions</i>]. (M, L.) ―         -b4-  مَلَذَهُ, aor.      <br>\

                  , inf. n. مَلْذٌ and مَلَاذَةٌ, <i>He contented him with courteous and soothing speech, and made him to hear that which rejoiced him, without doing,</i> or <i>performing, anything.</i> (T, L.) Accord. to Aboo-Is-hák, the ذ in this word is a substitute for ث. (M, L.) See مَلَثَهُ. ―         -b5-  مَلَذَ, inf. n. مَلْذٌ, <i>He lied;</i> (K;) as also مَلَثَ. (TA.) ―         -b6-  مَلَذَهُ, (S, L,) inf. n. مَلْذٌ,  (S, L, K,) <i>He smote him and pierced him</i> with a spear. (S, L, K. *)    </entryFree> <br>\
