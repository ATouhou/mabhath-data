                   The <i>lightest,</i> or <i>slightest, of the diseases incident to camels.</i> (El-Hejeree.) ―         -b2-  Also, <i>A certain tree, two carats&#39; weight</i> (قِيرَاطَانِ) <i>of the root of which is an emetic and laxative:</i> (K:) or, as in one copy [of the K], <i>a certain plant, in the root of which is a poisonous quality</i> (سمية [i. e., سُمِّيَّة]); <i>the drinking of a grain of it</i> [<i>in water</i>] <i>causes looseness of the bowels, and vomiting, in an excessive degree.</i> (TA.) But these properties [says SM] are strange, and not mentioned by the physicians. Ibn-El-Kutbee says, in [the book entitled] مَا لَا يَسَعُ الطَّبِيبَ جَهْلُهُ, مغاث is [the name of] <i>roots which are imported, of a hot and moist temperament, in one of the last measures of the second degree,</i> (فى اواخر الثانية,) [the degrees of heat and cold and dryness and moistness being four,] <i>the best of which are the white and soft, inclining to yellow: it is fattening, strengthening to the limbs</i> or <i>members, of use in cases of fracture and contusion, applied in a bandage, and drunk; also for the gout</i> (نِقْرِس), <i>and spasmodic contraction</i> (تَشَنُّج); <i>and softens hardness of the joints; and improves the voice, and clears the throat and lungs; and excites to sexual intercourse.</i> Some say, that it is the name of] the <i>roots of the wild pomegranate;</i> but this assertion is not of established authority. Others say, that it is <i>a kind of</i> <br>\
                  سُورَنْجَان; and this is not improbable. The hakeem [Dáood] says, in the Tedhkireh, مغاث is [the name of] <i>a certain plant in El-Kerej</i> (الكرج) <i>and the parts adjacent; roots extending deep into the earth, and thick, with a rind inclining to black and red, which, when peeled off, discloses a substance, between white and yellow: the best thereof is the heavy, sweet-scented, in taste inclining to sweet, with a slight bitterness. It is said to have rough,</i> or <i>coarse, and wide, leaves, like those of the radish; and a white flower; and seeds resembling the grains of the</i> <br>\

                  سورنجان: <i>its strength,</i> or <i>virtue, lasts about seven years: and there is a kind of it brought from &#39;Abbádán, and towards Syria, weak in operation; and it is this which is used in Egypt.</i> (TA.) [M. Rouyer, in the Descr. de l&#39;Egypte, tome 11 of the sec. ed., p. 452, describes it as follows: <i>a root of a whitish colour, mucilaginous, fleshy,</i> or <i>pulpous, and of an aromatic odour: it is nutritive and aphrodisiac: it is taken in the simple substance; and they make of it a sherbet, which should be drunk hot: this root comes from the Indies.</i>]    </entryFree> <br>\
