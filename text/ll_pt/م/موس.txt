                  , not اَلْمَاسٌ, (K,) i. e., with the disjunctive hemzeh, (TA,) for this is an incorrect pronunciation, (K,) of the vulgar, as Sgh and others have plainly asserted; but IAth says, I think that the hemzeh and lám in it are radical letters, as they are in الياس, [i. e., اـِلْيَاس or اَلْيَاس,] and it is not Arabic; and if so, its place is under the letter hemzeh, because they say اَلْمَاسٌ; but if they be [prefixed] for the purpose of rendering the word determinate, the present is its [proper] place; (TA;) [<i>The diamond;</i>] <i>a certain precious stone,</i> (K, * TA,) <i>reckoned among jewels, like the</i> <br>\

                   [<i>A razor;</i>] <i>a certain instrument of iron,</i> (M, Msb, TA,) <i>with which one shaves:</i> (Lth, L, K, TA:) of the measure فُعْلَى, (Ks, M, Msb, K,) from المَوْسُ, [inf. n. of مَاسَ,] so that the م is a radical letter, (K,) accord. to Lth, (TA,) [for] Lth says, (L, TA,) المَوْسُ is the root (تَاْسِيس [lit. foundation]) of المُوسَى, (L, K, TA,) the thing with which one shaves; (L, TA;) therefore, (Az, Msb, K,) it is imperfectly decl., because of the short fem. ا [written ى], (Msb,) without tenween; (Az, K;) and Fr cites a verse [of obscene meaning] in which it is made fem.: (TA:) or it is from اَوْسَيْتُ رَاْسَهُ, meaning “ I shaved his head, ” (ISk, M, * Msb, K,) of the measure مُفْعَلٌ, (ISk, Msb, TA,) so that the ى is a radical letter, as El-Umawee and Yz say, and Aboo-&#39;Amr Ibn-el-Alà inclined to think it so, (TA,) and therefore it is perfectly decl., (Msb,) with tenween, (Msb, K,) when indeterminate; (Msb;) or it is of the measure مُفْعَلٌ because this measure is more common than فُعْلَى, and because it is perfectly decl. when indeterminate, whereas فُعْلَى is not so when indeterminate and when determinate: (Ibn-EsSarráj, TA:) but IAmb says, that it is masc. and fem., and perfectly decl. and imperfectly decl.: ISk says, that the approved way is to make it perfectly decl.: (Msb:) [but] he says that it is fem. [also, and if so it is imperfectly decl.]: (TA:) and it is related of A&#39;Obeyd, in the Bári&#39;, that he said he had not heard it made masc. except by El-Umawee; (Msb;) who asserted it to be masc. only: (TA:) the pl., accord. to him who makes it imperfectly decl., is مُوسَيَاتٌ; and accord. to him who makes it perfectly decl., مَوَاسٍ. (Msb.) The dim. of موسى, in the sense above explained, [not as a proper name, in which case it is مُوسَى only, without tenween, and has no relation to the same word signifying a razor,] is مُوَيْسِيَةٌ, [but by rule it should be مُوَيْسَى, like حُبَيْلَى,] accord. to him who says هٰذِهِ مُوسَى; and مُوَيْسٍ accord. to him who says هٰذَا مُوسًى.
