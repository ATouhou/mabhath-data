      اُجْرَةٌ: (TA:) or, as some say, there is a distinction between اَجْرٌ and ثَوَابٌ: El-&#39;Eynee says, in the Expos. of El-Bukháree, that what is obtained by the fundamental practices of the law, and by obligatory religious services, is termed ثواب; and what is obtained by supererogatory acts of religion, اجر; for ثواب is properly a substitute for a thing itself; and اجر, for the profit arising from a thing; though each is sometimes used in the sense of the other: (TA:) it is well known that اجر signifies <i>a recompense,</i> or <i>reward, from God to a man, for righteous conduct;</i> (MF;) <i>and</i> ↓ <br>\
      اـِجَارَةٌ, <i>recompense, compensation, hire, pay,</i> or <i>wages, from one man to another, for work;</i> (Mgh, MF;) and hence الاَجِيرُ; (MF;) and ↓ <br>\
      اُجْرَةٌ also has this latter signification, (Mgh, TA,) and is syn. with كِرَا=ءٌ; (S, Mgh, K;) [signifying likewise <i>rent</i> for a house, and <i>the like;</i>] but اَجْرٌ is used [sometimes] in the sense of اـِجَارَةٌ and in that of اُجْرَةٌ: (Msb:) the pl. of اَجْرٌ is اُجُورٌ (Msb, K) and ا=جَارٌ; (K;) but the latter form was unknown to MF: (TA:) the pl. of ↓ <br>\
      اُجْرَةٌ is اَجَرٌ and اُجُرَاتٌ and اُجَرَاتٌ. (Msb.) [One says, اَجْرُكَ عَلَي اللّٰهِ <br>\
                  <i>Thy recompense is due from God.</i> And, to console a person for the death of a relation or friend, عَظَّمَ اللّٰهُ اَجْرَكَ <br>\
