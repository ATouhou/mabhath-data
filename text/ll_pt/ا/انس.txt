(TA.) It is related that a party of the jinn, or genii, came to a company of men, and asked permission to go in to them, whereupon the latter said to them, Who are ye? and they answered, نَاسٌ مِنَ <br>\
                  الجنِّ [<i>A people of the jinn</i>], making their answer to accord. with common usage; for it is customary for men, when it is said to them, Who are ye? to answer, نَاسٌ مِنْ بَنِى فُلَانٍ [<i>Men of the sons of such a one</i>].
