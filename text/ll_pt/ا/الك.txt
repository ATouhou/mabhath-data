                  <i>He chews,</i> or <i>champs, the bits:</i> but the verb commonly known is يَلُوكَ, or يَعْلُكُ. (Lth.) ―         -b2-  [Hence, accord. to some, (see اَلُوكٌ,)] اَلَكَ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ, (Msb, TA,) aor.      <br>\
                     اَلِكَ<br>\

                  , inf. n. اَلْكٌ, <i>He conveyed,</i> or <i>communicated, to him a message.</i> (Kr.) ―         -b4-  And اَلَكَ <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                   is from اَلَكَ signifying “he sent;” and is originally اَاْلِكْنِى; the [second] hemzeh being transposed and placed after the ل, it becomes اَلْيِكْنِى; then the hemzeh has its vowel transferred to the ل and is thrown out; as is done in the case of مَلَكٌ, which is originally مَاْلَكٌ, then مَلْاَكٌ, and then مَلَكٌ: (IB in art. لوك:) it means <i>Be thou my messenger;</i> and <i>bear thou my message;</i> and is often used by the poets. (S in art. لوك.) Accord. to IAmb, one says, اَلِكْنِى اـِلَى فُلَانٍ, meaning <i>send thou me to such a one:</i> [but I do not know any instance in which this meaning is applicable:] and the original form is اَلْيِكْنِى; or, if from الاَلُوكُ, the original form is اَاْلِكْنِى: and he also says that it means <i>be thou my messenger to such a one.</i> (TA.) One says also, اَلِكْنِى اـِلَيْهَا بِرِسَالَةٍ, which should properly mean <i>Send thou me to her with a message:</i> but it is an inverted phrase; since the meaning is, <i>be thou my messenger to her with this message</i> [or <i>rather with a message</i>]: and اَلِكْنِى اـِلَيْهَا بِالسَّلَامِ i. e. <i>convey thou,</i> or <i>communicate thou, to her my salutation;</i> or <i>be thou my messenger to her</i> [<i>with salutation</i>]: and sometimes this [prep.] ب is suppressed, so that one says, اَلِكْنِى اـِلَيْهَا السَّلَامَ: sometimes, also, the person sent is he to whom the message is sent; as in the saying, اَلِكْنِى اـِلَيْكَ السَّلَامَ [virtually meaning <i>receive thou my salutation;</i> but literally] <i>be thou my messenger to thyself with salutation.</i> (TA.) Lh mentions the phrase اَلَكْتُهُ اـِلَيْهِ, with respect to a message, aor. اُلِيكُهُ, inf. n. اـِلَاكَهٌ; in which case, the hemzeh [in the aor. and inf. n.] is converted into a letter of prolongation.

(TA.) ―         -b2-  [And hence, accord. to some,] <i>A message,</i> or <i>communication sent from one person or party to another;</i> (Lth, S, M, K, &amp;amp;c.; [in the CK, after الرِّسالَةُ, by which الاَلُوكُ is explained in the K &amp;amp;c., we find قِبَلَ المَلِكِ مُشْتَقٌّ منهُ, in which the first two words should be قِيلَ المَلَكُ, as in other copies of the K and in the TA; and الاُلُوكُ is erroneously put, in the CK, for الاَلُوكُ;]) said by Lth and ISd to be so called because it is [as it were] chewed in the mouth; (TA;) as also ↓ <br>\

      مَاْلُكٌ: (S, M, Msb. K, &amp;amp;c.:) accord. to Kr, (TA,) this last is the only word of the measure مَفْعُلٌ: (K, TA:) but accord. to Sb and Akh, there is no word of this measure: (TA:) [i. e. there is none originally  of this measure:] other instances have been mentioned; namely, مَكْرُمٌ and مَعُونٌ [originally مَعْوُنٌ] and مَقْبُرٌ and مَهْلُكٌ and مَيْسُرٌ, which last occurs in the Kur [ii. 280], accord. to one reading, in the words فَنَظِرَةٌ اـِلَى مَيْسُرِهِ; but it is said that each of these, and مَاْلُكٌ also, may be regarded as originally with ة; or, accord. to AHei, each is [virtually, though not in the language of the grammarians,] a pl. of the same with ة; (MF, TA;) and Akh says the same with respect to مَكْرُمٌ and مَعُونٌ: (TA:) Seer says that each is curtailed of ة by poetic licence; but this assertion will not apply to مَيْسُرٌ, as it occurs in the Kur. (MF, TA.) ―         -b3-  اَلُوكٌ also signifies <i>A messenger.</i> (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K. [In the CK here follows, والماْلُوْكُ والمَاْلُقُ: but the right reading is وَالمَاْلُوكُ المَاْلُوقُ, as in other copies and in the TA.])    </entryFree> <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                   is said to be the original form of مَلَكٌ [<i>An angel;</i> so called because he conveys, or communicates, the message from God; (K, * TA, in art. لاك;)] derived from اَلُوكٌ; (Msb, K, TA; [but in the CK is a mistake here, pointed out above, voce اَلُوكٌ;]) so that the measure of مَلَكٌ is مَعَلٌ: (Msb:) مَلَكٌ is both sing. and pl.: Ks says that it is originally مَاْلَكٌ, from اَلُوكٌ signifying “a message;” then, by transposition, مَلْاَكٌ, a form also in use; and then, in consequence of frequency of usage, the hemzeh is suppressed, so that it becomes مَلَكٌ; but in forming the pl., they restore it to مَلْاَكٌ, saying مَلَايِكَةٌ, and مَلَايِكُ also: (S in art. ملك:) or, accord. to some, it is from لَاَكَ “he sent;” so that the measure of مَلَكٌ is مَفَلٌ: and there are other opinions respecting it: (Msb:) some say that its م is a radical: see art. ملك.
