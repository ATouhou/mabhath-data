[See اَمْنٌ, below.] You say also, يَاـْمَنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ [<i>He is secure,</i> or <i>safe,</i> or <i>free from fear, for himself</i>]. (M.) And اَمِنَ البَلَدُ, meaning <i>The inhabitants of the country</i> or <i>district,</i> or <i>town, were in a state of security,</i> or <i>confidence, therein.</i> (Msb.) The verb is trans. by itself, and by means of the particle مِنْ; as in اَمَنَ زَيْدٌ الاَسَدَ and اَمِنَ مِنَ <br>\
                  الاَسَدِ, meaning <i>Zeyd was,</i> or <i>became,</i> or <i>felt, secure from, safe from,</i> [or <i>free from fear of,</i>] <i>the lion.</i> (Msb.) You say also, اَمِنَ كَذِبَ مَنْ <br>\
                  اَخْبَرَهُ [<i>He was secure from,</i> or <i>free from fear of, the lying of him who informed him</i>]. (M.) And لَا ا=نَنُ اَنْ يَكُونَ كَذلِكَ [<i>I am not free from fear of its being so; I am not sure but that it may be so</i>]. (Mgh in art. نبذ; and other lexicons passim.) And, of a strong-made she camel, اَمِنَتْ <br>\
                  اَنْ تَكُونَ ضَعَيفَةً [<i>She was secure from,</i> or <i>free from fear of, being weak</i>]: (M: [in a copy of the S اُمِنَتْ:]) and اَمِنَتِ العِثَارَ وَالاـَعْيَا=ءٍ [<i>She was secure from,</i> or <i>free from fear of, stumbling, and becoming jaded</i>]: (M:) and اُمِنَ عِثَارُهَا [<i>Her stumbling was not feared</i>]. (So in a copy of the S.) And, of a highly-prized camel, اُمِنَ اَنْ يُنْحَرَ [<i>It was not feared that he would be slaughtered;</i> or <i>his being slaughtered was not feared</i>]. (M.) [اَمنَهُ sometimes means <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, free from fear, though having cause for fear, of him,</i> or <i>it.</i> i. e. <i>he thought himself secure,</i> or <i>safe, from him</i> or <i>it.</i> (See Kur vii. 97.)] ―         -b2-  امِنَهُ (inf. n. اَمْنٌ TK) [and accord. to some copies of the K ↓ <br>\

      استامنهُ all signify the same (M, K, TA) [<i>He trusted,</i> or <i>confided, in him;</i> (as also ا=من بِهِ, q. v.;) <i>he intrusted him with,</i> or <i>confided to him, power, authority, control,</i> or <i>a charge; he gave him charge</i> over a thing or person: these meanings are vaguely indicated in the M and K and TA.]. You say, يَاْمَنُهُ النَّاسُ وَلَا يَخَافُونَ غَايِلَتَهُ [<i>Men,</i> or <i>people, trust,</i> or <i>confide, in him, and do not fear his malevolence,</i> or <i>mischievousness</i>]. (T, M.) And اَمِنَهُ عَلَى كَذَا (S, Mgh, * Msb *) and ↓ <br>\
      ايتمنهُ <br>\

                  <i>over such a thing.</i> (Mgh.) Hence, in a trad., the مُوَذِّن is said to be مُوْتَمَنٌ; i. e. النَّاسُ عَلَ الاَوْقَاتِ الَّتِى يُوَذَّنُ فِيهَا ↓ <br>\
      يَاْتَمِنُهُ [<i>Men trust,</i> or <i>confide, in him with respect to the times in which he calls to prayer</i>], and know, by his calling to prayer, what they are commanded to do, as to praying and fasting and breaking fast. (Mgh.) It is said in the Kur [xii. 11], مَا لَكَ <br>\
                  لَا تَاْمَنُنَا عَلَى يُوسُفَ and [تَاْمَنَّا] with idghám [i. e. <i>What aileth thee that thou dost not trust,</i> or <i>confide, in us with respect to Joseph?</i> or, <i>that thou dost not give us charge over Joseph?</i>]; (S;) meaning, why dost thou fear us for him? (Bd;) some pronouncing the verb in a manner between those of the former and the latter modes of writing it; but Akh says that the latter is better: (S:) some read تِيمَنَّا. (Bd.) You say also, ↓ <br>\
      اُوتُمِنَ <br>\
                  فُلَانٌ [<i>Such a one was trusted,</i> or <i>confided, in</i> &amp;amp;c.;] when it begins a sentence, changing the second ء into و; in like manner as you change it into ى when the first is with kesr, as in اِيتَمَنَهُ; and into ا when the first is with fet-h, as in ا=مَنَ. (S.) The phrase اَمَانَةً ↓ <br>\
      اُوتُمِنَ, in a saying of Mohammad, if it be not correctly عَلَى اَمَانَةٍ, may be explained as implying the meaning of اُسْتُحْفِظَ اَمَانَةً [<i>He was asked to take care of a deposite;</i> or <i>he was intrusted with it</i>]. (Mgh.) [You also say, اَمِنَهُ بِكَذَا, meaning <i>He intrusted him with such a thing;</i> as, for instance, money or other property: see two exs. in the Kur iii. 68.]       -A2-  اَمُنَ, (M, Mgh, K,) or اَمِنَ, (Msb,) inf. n. اَمَانَةٌ, (M, Mgh, Msb,) <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, trusted in,</i> or <i>confided in:</i> (M, K:) or <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, trusty, trustworthy, trustful, confidential,</i> or <i>faithful:</i> said of a man.

                     ا=من<br>\
                   is originally اَاْمَنَ; the second ء being softened. (S.) You say, ا=منهُ, [inf. n. اـِيمَانٌ;] (S, M, Msb;) and ↓ <br>\
      امّنهُ, [inf. n. تَاْمِينٌ;] (M, TA;) meaning <i>He rendered him secure,</i> or <i>safe;</i> (Msb;) <i>he rendered him secure,</i> or <i>free from fear;</i> (S, M, TA;) <i>contr. of</i> <br>\
                  اَخَافهُ: (TA:) so in ا=مَنْتُهُ مِنْهُ <br>\
                  <i>I rendered him secure,</i> or <i>safe, from him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (Msb.) And of God you say, ا=مَنَ عِبادَهُ مِنْ اَنْ يَظْلِمَهُمْ [<i>He hath rendered his servants secure from his wronging them</i>]. (S.) And يُوْمِنُ عِبَادَهُ مِنْ عَذَابِهِ [<i>He rendereth his servants secure from his punishment</i>]. (M.) You say also, ا=مَنْتُ الاَسِيرَ, meaning <i>I gave,</i> or <i>granted,</i> <br>\
                  الاَمَان [i. e. <i>security</i> or <i>safety,</i> or <i>protection</i> or <i>safeguard,</i> or <i>the promise</i> or <i>assurance of security</i> or <i>safety,</i> or <i>indemnity,</i> or <i>quarter,</i>] <i>to the captive.</i> (Msb.) And ا=مَنَ فُلَانٌ الَعَدُوَّ [<i>Such a one granted security,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>to the enemy</i>], inf. n. as above. (T.) It is said in the Kur ch. ix. [verse 12], accord. to one reading, لَا اـِيمَانَ لَهُمْ <br>\
                  <i>They have not the attribute of granting protection;</i> meaning that when they grant protection, they do not fulfil their engagement to protect. (T.)       -A2-  اـِيمَانٌ also signifies The <i>believing</i> [a thing, or in a thing, and particularly in God]; syn. تَصْدِيقٌ; (T, S, &amp;amp;c.;) by common consent of the lexicologists and other men of science: (T:) its primary meaning is the <i>becoming true to the trust with respect to which God has confided in one, by a firm believing with the heart; not by profession of belief with the tongue only, without the assent of the heart;</i> for he who does not firmly believe with his heart is either a hypocrite or an ignorant person. (T, TA.) Its verb is intrans. and trans. (TA, from a Commentary on the Mutowwal.) You say, ا=مَنَ, meaning <i>He believed.</i> (T.) And it is said to be trans. by itself, like صَدَّقَ; and by means of بِ, considered as meaning اِعْتِرَافٌ [or <i>acknowledgment</i>]; and by means of لِ, considered as meaning اـِذْعَانٌ [or <i>submission</i>]. (TA.) [Thus] you say, [ا=منهُ and] ا=من بِهِ, (inf. n. اـِيمَانٌ, T, K,) namely, a thing. (T, M.) And ا=من بِاللّٰهِ <br>\
                  <i>He believed in God.</i> (T.) It seems to be meant by what is said in the Ksh [in ii. 2], that ا=من بِهِ [or ا=مَنَهُ] properly signifies ا=مَنَهُ التَّكْذِيبَ [<i>He rendered him secure from being charged with lying,</i> or <i>falsehood</i>]; and that the meaning <i>he believed him</i> or <i>in him,</i> is tropical; but this is at variance with what its author says in the A; and Es-Saad says that this latter meaning is proper. (TA.)   The phrase in the Kur [ix. 61], وَيُوْمِنُ لِلْموْمِنِينَ, accord. to Th, means <i>And he believeth the believers; giveth credit to them.</i> (M.) ―         -b2-  Sometimes it is employed to signify The <i>acknowledging with the tongue</i> only; and hence, in the Kur [lxiii. 3], ذلِكَ باَنَّهُمْ ا=مَنُوا ثُمَّ كَفَرُوا <br>\
                  <i>That is because they acknowledged with the tongue, then disacknowledged with the heart.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The <i>trusting,</i> or <i>confiding,</i> or <i>having trust</i> or <i>confidence.</i> (M, K.) [You say, ا=من بِهِ, meaning <i>He trusted,</i> or <i>confided, in him,</i> or <i>it:</i> for] the verb of ايمان in this sense is trans. by means of بِ without implication; as Bd says. (TA.) [And it is also trans. by itself: for] you say, مَا ا=مَنَ اَنْ يَجِدَ صَحَابَةً, meaning (tropical:)  <i>He trusted not that he would find companions;</i> (M, * K, * TA;) said of one who has formed the intention of journeying: or the meaning is مَا كَادَ [i. e. <i>he hardly,</i> or <i>scarcely, found</i> &amp;amp;c.; or <i>he was not near to finding</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (M, K.) See also اَمِنَهُ. ―         -b4-  Also The <i>manifesting humility</i> or <i>submission, and the accepting the Law,</i> (Zj, T, * K,) <i>and that which the Prophet has said</i> or <i>done, and the firm believing thereof with the heart;</i> (Zj, T, M;) without which firm belief, the manifesting of humility or submission, and the accepting that which the Prophet has said or done, is termed اـِسْلَامٌ, for which one&#39;s blood is to be spared. (T.) [In this sense, it is trans. by means of لِ, accord. to some, as shown above; or by means of بِ, for, accord. to Fei,] you say, ا=مَنْتُ بِاللّٰهِ, inf. n. as above, meaning <i>I submitted,</i> or <i>resigned, myself to God.</i> (Msb.)
