[of pauc.] ا=بَادٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and [of mult.] اُبُودٌ (S, M, K) [and اَبَدُونَ, of which an ex. will be found below]: but the use of these pls. is restricted to particular cases, to signify portions of time, or to serve as corroboratives to the sing.: (MF:) as signifying an extended indivisible space of time, [or the like,] اَبَدٌ should have neither dual nor pl.; but ا=بَادٌ is sometimes said, when the sing. is restricted to denote a particular part, or portion, of the whole of that to which it applies, in like manner as a generic noun is restricted to a special and partial signification: some, however, have mentioned ا=بَادٌ as being post-classical; not of the language of the Arabs called العَرَبُ العَرْبَا=ءُ.

(TA.) [So, too, does الاَبَدَ, unless used in a limited sense known to the hearer.] When you say, لَا اُكَلِّمُهُ اَبَدًا, you mean, [<i>I will not speak to him as long as I live,</i> or <i>henceforth,</i> or <i>ever;</i> or <i>I will never speak to him;</i> i. e.,] from the time of your speaking to the end of your life. (Msb.) [In this case, اَبَدًا may also be considered as a mere corroborative. It is used in both these ways (للتَّاْسِيسِ and لِلتَّوْكِيدِ) in affirmative as well as negative sentences. For exs. of its use in affirmative sentences, see the Kur xviii. 2 and iv. 60, &amp;amp;c.] One also says, لَا اَفْعَلُهُ, (S, M, A,) and لَا ا=تِيهِ, (T, K,) اَبَدَ الا=بَادِ, (T, M, A, K,) which, though of classical authority, is said to be no evidence of the use of ا=باد as a pl. of اَبَدٌ in a general way by the Arabs of the classical ages, as it is here added merely as a corroborative, as ا=زال is in the phrase اَزَلَ الا=زَالِ; (MF;) and اَبَدَ الاَبَدِينَ, (M, A, K,) in which the latter word is not a rel. n., for if so it would be الاَبَدِيِّينَ, but app. a pl., (M,) like اَرَضُونَ; (M, K;) and ↓ <br>\
