                   is originally the inf. n. of اَجَلَ شَرًّا “ he committed evil; ” and is used to indicate the causation of crimes; and afterwards, by extension of its application, to indicate any causation: (Bd in v. 35:) one says, فَعَلْتُهُ مِنْ اَجْلِكَ, and ↓ <br>\

[<i>I did it</i>] مِنْ جَرَّاكَ, (S,) which means [originally] <i>in consequence of thy committing it:</i> (Bd ubi suprà:) [and then, by extension of its application, as shown above, <i>because of thee,</i> or <i>of thine act</i> &amp;amp;c.; <i>on thine account; for thy sake;</i> as also لِاَجْلِكَ, which is more common in the present day:] or منْ جَلَلِكَ: (K:) and مِنْ اَجْلِهِ كَانَ كَذَا, i. e. بِسَبَبِهِ [<i>Because of him,</i> or <i>it, it was thus,</i> or <i>such a thing was</i>].

      اَجِلْ as well as اَجَلْ] like نعم [which is written نَعِمٌ as well as نَعَمْ]: (TA:) it is a particle (Mughnee) denoting a reply; like نَعَمْ; (S, Mughnee, K;) importing acknowledgment of the truth of the speaker, to him who gives information; and the making a thing known, to him who asks information; and a promise, to him who seeks, or demands; (Mughnee;) i. e. <i>It is as thou sayest</i> [in the first case; and <i>yes,</i> or <i>yea,</i> in the same, and in the other cases]; (K voce بَسَلٌ;) therefore it occurs after such sayings as “ Zeyd stood ” and “ did Zeyd stand? ” and “ beat thou Zeyd: ” but ElMálakee restricts the information to that which is affirmative, and the saying expressive of seeking or demanding to that which is without prohibition: and it is said by some that it does not occur after an interrogation: (Mughnee:) Er-Radee says, in the Expos. of the Káfiyeh, after Z and others, that it is to denote acknowledgment of the truth of information, and does not occur after a saying in which is the meaning of seeking, or demanding: (TA:) or, accord. to Z and Ibn-Málik and others, it relates particularly to information: and accord. to Ibn-Kharoof, it occurs mostly after information: (Mughnee:) in the Expos. of the Tes-heel, it is said to be for denoting acknowledgment of the truth of information, past or other, affirmative or negative, and not to occur after an interrogation: (TA:) Akh says that it is better than نَعَمْ (S, Mughnee, K *) after information, (Mughnee,) in acknowledging the truth of what is said; (S, Mughnee, K;) and نعم is better than it after an interrogation: (S, Mughnee, K:) so that when one says, سَوْفَ تَذْهَبُ [Thou wilt, or shalt, go away], thou sayest اَجَلْ [<i>Yes</i>]; and it is better than نعم: but when one says, اَتَذْهَبُ [Wilt thou go away?], thou sayest نعم; and it is better than اجل.

                   The <i>term,</i> or <i>period,</i> of a thing: (S, K:) its <i>assigned, appointed,</i> or <i>specified, term</i> or <i>period:</i> this is the primary signification: (TA:) or the <i>term,</i> or <i>period,</i> and <i>time of falling due,</i> of a thing: (Msb:) pl. ا=جَالٌ. (Msb, K.) ―         -b2-  Hence, The <i>period of</i> women&#39;s <i>waiting, before they may marry again, after divorce:</i> as in the Kur ii. 231 and 232. (TA.) ―         -b3-  The <i>period,</i> or <i>extremity of time, in which falls due a debt</i> (K, TA) and <i>the like.</i> (TA.) You say, بَاعَهُ اـِيَّاهُ اـِلَي اَجَلٍ [<i>He sold it to him for payment at an appointed period</i>]: and سَلَّمَ الدَّارَاهِمَ فِى طَعَامٍ اـِلَي اَجَلٍ [<i>He delivered the money for wheat,</i> or <i>the like, to be given at an appointed period</i>]. (Msb in art. كلا.) ―         -b4-  The <i>term,</i> or <i>period, of death;</i> (K;) the <i>time in which God has eternally decreed the end of life by slaughter or otherwise:</i> or, as some say, the <i>whole duration of life:</i> and <i>its end:</i> a man&#39;s <i>life</i> being thus termed: and his <i>death, by which it terminates:</i> (Kull p. 17:) the <i>assigned,</i> or <i>appointed, duration of the life</i> of a man. (TA.) One says, دَنَا اَجَلُهُ, meaning <i>His death drew near;</i> originally, اْسْتِيفَا=ءُ الاَجَلِ <br>\
                  <i>the completion of the duration of life.</i> (TA.) In the Kur vi. 128, (see 2, above,) the meaning is, The <i>term of death:</i> or, as some say, the <i>term of extreme old age:</i> (TA:) or the <i>day of resurrection.</i> (Bd, * Jel.) The words of the Kur [vi. 2] ثُمَّ قَضَى اَجَلًا وَ اَجَلٌ <br>\
                  مَسَمَّى عِنْدَهُ mean [<i>Then He decreed a term,</i>] <i>the term of death, and</i> [<i>there is a term named with Him,</i>] <i>the term of the resurrection:</i> or <i>the period between the creation and death,</i> and <i>the period between death and the resurrection;</i> for اجل is applied to the <i>end of a space of time</i> and to the <i>whole thereof:</i> (Bd:) or the meaning is, <i>the period of sleep,</i> and <i>the period of death:</i> (Bd, TA:) or <i>the period of those who have passed away,</i> and <i>the period of those who remain and those who are to come:</i> (Bd:) or <i>the period of remaining in this world,</i> and <i>the period of remaining in the world to come:</i> or in both instances <i>death</i> is meant; [<i>accidental,</i> and <i>natural;</i>] for the اجل of some is by accidental means, as the sword, and drowning, and burning, and eating what disagrees, and other means of destruction; while some have their full periods granted to them and are preserved in health until they die a natural death: or the اجل of some is that of him who dies in a state of happiness and enjoyment; and of others, that of him who reaches a limit beyond which God has no؟ appointed, in the natural course of this world, any one to remain therein; and to both of these, reference is made in the Kur [xvi. 72 and] xxii. 5. (TA.) ―         -b5-  Sometimes, also, it means <i>Destruction:</i> and thus it has been explained as occurring in the Kur [vii. 184], where it is said, وَاَنْ عَسَى اَنْ يَكُونَ قَدِ اْ قْتَرَبَ اَجَلُهُمْ [<i>And that, may be, their destruction shall have drawn near</i>].
