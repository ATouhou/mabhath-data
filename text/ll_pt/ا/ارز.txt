      اُرْزٌ The <i>pine-tree;</i> syn. شَجَرُ الصَّنَوْبَرِ: (K:) or this is called ↓ <br>\
      اَرْرَةٌ, and اَرْزٌ is the pl.: (A &#39;Obeyd, S:) [or rather اَرْزٌ is a coll. gen. n., and اَرْزَةٌ is the n. un.:] or the <i>male of that kind of tree;</i> (AHn, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      اَرْزَةٌ; (K;) and the author of the Minháj adds, it is <i>that which does not produce fruit; but pitch</i> (زِفْت) <i>is extracted from its trunks and roots, and its wood is employed as a means of light, like as candles are employed; and it grows not in the land of the Arabs:</i> A &#39;Obeyd says, ↓ <br>\
      اَرْزَةٌ is the <i>name of a tree well known in Syria, called with us</i> <br>\
                  صَنَوْبَرٌ, <i>because of its fruit:</i> he says also, I have seen this kind of tree, called اَرْزَةٌ, and it is called in El-&#39;Irák صَنَوْبَرٌ, but this last is the name of the fruit of the اَرْز: (TA:) or <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  عَرْعَرٌ [a name given to the <i>cypress</i> and to the <i>juniper-tree</i>]. (K.) It is said in a trad., المُجْذِيَةِ ↓ <br>\

      الاَرَزَة, with fet-h to the ر; meaning the tree called الاَرْزَن: but A &#39;Obeyd thinks this to be a mistake, and that it is ↓ <br>\
