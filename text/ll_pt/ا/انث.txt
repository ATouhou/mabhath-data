In the Kur iv. 117, I&#39;Ab reads اُثُنًا [in the place of اُنُثًا or اـِنَاثًا]; and Fr says that it is pl. of وَثَنٌ, the و in وُثُنٌ being changed into ا as in اُقِّتَتٌ [for وُقِّتَتٌ].

                   also signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>Inanimate things;</i> (Lh, T, M, K;) as trees and stones (T, K) and wood. (T.) In the passage of the Kur mentioned above, اـِنَاثًا is said to have this meaning: (T, M:) [or it there means <i>females;</i> for] Fr says that El-Lát and El-&#39;Ozzà and the like were said by the Arabs to be feminine divinities.

(M, Mgh, Msb.) ―         -b4-  And <i>The two ears:</i> (As, T, S, M, A, Mgh, K:) because they are of the fem. gender. (TA.) ―         -b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  <i>The two tribes of Bejeeleh and Kudá&#39;ah.</i> (K) ―         -b6-  And اُنْثَيَا الفَرَسِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The inner parts</i> (الرَّبَلَتَانِ) <i>of the thighs of the horse.</i> (M, L.) ―         -b7-  And الاُنْثَي is also used to signify (assumed tropical:)  <i>The</i> [<i>engine of war called</i>] مَنْجَنِيق; because the latter word is [generally] of the feminine gender.
