                  <i>Retention of enmity in the bosom, with watchfulness for an opportunity to indulge it,</i> or <i>exercise it;</i> or <i>concealment of enmity in the bosom;</i> or <i>rancour, malevolence, malice,</i> or <i>spite:</i> (S, Msb, K:) and <i>anger</i> (K, TA) <i>coming upon one suddenly therefrom:</i> (TA:) pl. اـِحَنٌ. (S, Msb, K.) It is said in the S that one should not say حِنَةٌ; and this is disallowed by As and Fr and Ibn-El-Faraj: in the T it is said that it is not of the language of the Arabs; and As is related to have disapproved of Et-Tirimmáh for using its pl. in poetry: but it is said in a trad., مَا بَيْنِى وبَيْنَ العَرَبِ حِنَةٌ [<i>There is not between me and the Arabs retention of enmity in the bosom,</i> &amp;amp;c.]; and it occurs in another trad., in a similar phrase; and the pl., in a third trad.; therefore we say that it is a dial. var. of rare occurrence.
