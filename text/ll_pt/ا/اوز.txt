                   (S, Msb, K) and اـِوَزَّةٌ, (S,) or the latter is the n. un. of the former, [which is a coll. gen. n.,] (Msb,) <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  بَطٌّ [The <i>goose,</i> or <i>geese;</i> and the <i>duck,</i> or <i>ducks;</i> but اوزّ is generally applied to the former of these birds; and بطّ, to the latter; agreeably with a statement in the Jm, that بَطٌّ is applied by the Arabs to the <i>small,</i> and اـِوَزٌّ to the <i>large</i>]; (S, K;) as also وَزٌّ, of which the n. un. is وَزَّةٌ: (Msb:) اـِوَزٌّ is of the measure فِعَلٌّ: (Msb:) [but see what follows:] the pl. is اـِوَزُّونَ, (S, Msb, K,) a form which is sometimes used, (S, Msb,) and which is anomalous. (Msb.) [See also كُرْكِىٌّ.] ―         -b2-  [Hence,] اـِوَزٌّ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>Short and thick:</i> (K:) <i>fleshy without being tall:</i> (Lth, TA:) fem. with ة. (TA.) El-&#39;Okberee asserts that the ا is augmentative, because it is followed by three radical letters: (MF, TA:) but ISd says that it is of the measure فِعَلٌّ, and may not be of the measure اـِفْعَلٌ, [i. e., originally اـِوْزَزٌ,] because this does not occur as the measure of an epithet. (TA.) [It seems, however, that اوزّ is in this case a subst. used tropically as an epithet, after the manner of many nicknames.] ―         -b3-  Also, applied to a man, and to a horse, and to a camel, <i>Firm in make:</i> (AHei in the Expos. of the Tes-heel, and TA:) or, applied to a horse, <i>compact and strong in make.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

Az says that it may be of the measure اـِفْعَلَى, [i. e., originally اـِوْزَزَّى,] or فِعَلَّى; but Abu-l-Hasan holds the latter to be the more correct, because it is the measure of many words relating to walking; as جِيَضَّى, and دِفَقَّى.
