                  <i>Make thou the two to become one.</i> (K.) It is related in a trad., that Mohammad said to a man who was making a sign with his two fore fingers in repeating the testimony of the faith, [There is no deity but God, &amp;amp;c.,] اَحِّدْاَحِّدْ [meaning that he should make the sign with one finger only]. (S.) And اَحَدَّ اللّٰهَ means <i>He declared God to be one; he declared,</i> or <i>professed, the unity of God;</i> as also وحّدهُ. (T and L in art. وحد.) ―         -b2-  اَحِّدِ العَشَرَةَ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَاْحِيدٌ, (K,) <i>Make thou the ten to become eleven,</i> (S, K,) is a phrase mentioned by Fr on the authority of an Arab of the desert.

<b>اَحَدٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     اَحَدٌ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  , originally وَحَدٌ, the و being changed into ا, (Msb,) <i>One;</i> the <i>first of the numbers;</i> (S;) syn. [in many cases] with وَاحِدٌ; (S, Msb, K;) with which it is interchangeable in two cases, to be explained below: (Msb:) pl. ا=حَادٌ and اٌحْدَانٌ (K) and اَحَدُونَ, which last occurs in a phrase hereafter to be mentioned; (TA;) or it has no pl. in this sense; (Msb, K, * TA;) and as to ا=حَادٌ, it may be pl. of وَاحِدٌ, [and originally اَوْحَادٌ,] like اَشْهَادٌ as pl. of شَاهِدٌ, (Th, Msb,) a pl. of pauc. (Msb.) The fem. is ↓ <br>\
      اـِحْدَى only; and this is only used in particular cases, to be shown below: (Msb:) most agree that the ى in this word is the characteristic of the fem. gender: but some say that it is to render it quasi-coordinate to the quadriliteral-radical class: [this, however, is inconsistent with its pronunciation, which is invariably اـِحْدَى, not اـِحْدَّى:] (TA:) its pl. is اـِحَدٌ, as though the sing. were اـِحْدَةٌ, like as is said of ذِكَرٌ as pl. of ذِكْرَى: one of the expositors of the Tes-heel writes it اُحَدٌ, with damm and then fet-h; but a pl. of this measure is not applicable to a sing. of the measure فِعْلَى, with kesr. (MF.) The dim. of اَحَدٌ is ↓ <br>\
      اُحَيْدٌ; and that of اـِحْدَى is ↓ <br>\
      اُحَيْدَى. (L in art. وحد.) ―         -b2-  It is interchangeable with وَاحِدٌ in two cases: first, when it is used as an epithet applied to God: (Msb:) for الاَحَدُ, as an epithet, is applied to God alone, (Msb, K,) and signifies <i>The One; the Sole; He who has ever been one and alone:</i> or <i>the Indivisible:</i> or <i>He who has no second</i> [<i>to share</i>] <i>in his lordship, nor in his essence, nor in his attributes:</i> (TA:) you say, هُوَ الوَاحِدُ and هُوَ الاَحَدُ: and in like manner, اَحَدٌ, without the article, is used as an epithet specially in relation to God, and is interchangeable in this case [but not in other cases] with وَاحِدٌ: therefore you do not say رَجُلٌ اَحَدٌ nor دِرْهَمٌ اَحَدٌ and the like [but رَجُلٌ <br>\
                  وَاحدٌ and دِرهَمٌ وَاحِدٌ &amp;amp;c.] (Msb.) [See also وَاحِدٌ, in art. وحد.] In the phrase in the Kur [cxii. 1], قُلْ هُوَ اللّٰهُ اَحَدٌ [<i>Say, He is God, One</i> God], اَحَدٌ is a substitute for اللّٰهُ; for an indeterminate noun is sometimes a substitute for a determinate noun, as in another passage in the Kur, xcvi. 15 and 16. (S.) Secondly, it is interchangeable with وَاحِدٌ in certain nouns of number: (Msb:) you say اَحَدَ عَشَرَ [masc.] and اـِحْدَى عَشْرَةَ [fem.] (S) [meaning <i>Eleven:</i> and in these two cases you may not substitute وَاحِدٌ and وَاحِدَةٌ for اَحَدٌ and اـِحْدَى: but] in اَحَدٌوعَشْرُونَ [<i>One and twenty,</i> and the like,] اَحَدٌ is interchangeable with وَاحِدٌ. (Msb.) Ks says, When you prefix the article ال to a number, prefix it to every number; therefore you should say, مَا فَعَلَتِ الاَحَدَ العَشَرَ <br>\
                  الاَلْفَ الدِّرْهَمَ [<i>What did the eleven thousand dirhems?</i>]: but the Basrees prefix it to the first only, and say, ما فعلت الاَحَدَ عَشَرَ اَلْفَ دِرْهَمٍ. (S.) ―         -b3-  In [most] cases differing from these two, there is a difference in usage between اَحَدٌ and وَاحِدٌ: the former is used in affirmative phrases as a prefixed noun only, governing the noun which follows it in the gen. case; [as in exs. which will be found below;] and is used absolutely in negative phrases; [as will also be seen in exs. below;] whereas وَاحِدٌ is used in affirmative phrases as a prefixed noun and otherwise: the fem. اـِحْدَى, also, is only used as a prefixed noun, except in numbers (Msb) [and in one other instance, which see below]. Using اَحَدٌ and its fem. in affirmative phrases as prefixed nouns, you say, قَامَ اَحَدُ الثَّلَاثَةِ [<i>One of the three stood</i>]; and قَالَتْ اـِحْدَا هُمَا [<i>One of them two</i> (females) <i>said</i>]; and خُذْ اـِحْدَى <br>\
                  الثَّلَاثَةِ [<i>Take thou one of the three</i>]. (TA.) The phrase اـِحْدَى بَنَاتِ طَبَقٍ means <i>A calamity:</i> (K:) or, as some say, (TA, but in the K “ and, ”) <i>a serpent;</i> (K, TA;) so called because it twists itself round so as to become like a طَبَق. (TA.) And the phrase اـِحْدَى الاـِحَدِ, (L, K, TA,) in which the latter word has kesr to the اـ and fet-h to the ح, and is pl. of the former, also written الاُحَدِ, but this form is disapproved by MF, as has been shown above, (TA, [in several copies of the K incorrectly written الاَحَدِ,]) [lit. means <i>One of the ones;</i> and] is applied to <i>a great,</i> or <i>mighty, event;</i> (L, K, TA;) <i>one that is difficult, distressing, grievous,</i> or <i>terrible.</i> (L, TA.) You say, اَتَى بِاـِحْدَى الاـِحَدِ [the last of which words is here again written in several copies of the K الاَحَدِ] <i>He brought to pass a grievous, and great,</i> or <i>mighty, event,</i> (K, TA,) when you desire to express the greatness and terribleness of an event. (TA.) You also say, فُلَانُ اَحَدُ الاَحَدِينَ, and وَاحِدُ الاَحَدِينَ, (K, TA,) the latter in one copy of the K written وَاحِدُ الوَاحِدِينَ, in which the latter word is pl. of the former, (TA,) and وَاحِدُ <br>\
                  الا=حَادِ, and اـِحْدَى الاـِحَدِ, (K, TA,) like a phrase before mentioned, only the former is applied to a calamity, and this to an intelligent being, and written in the two manners before mentioned, the difference being only in application, (TA, [in several copies of the K here again written اـِحْدَى <br>\
                  الاَحَدِ, and in the CK اَحَدِىُّ الاَحَدِ,]) and اـِحْدَى <br>\
                  الاَحَدِينَ, (Et-Tes-heel,) and اـِحْدَى الا=حَادِ, (TA,) which are expressions of the utmost praise, (IAar, A Heyth, K,) [lit. <i>Such a man is one of the ones;</i> meaning] <i>such a one is unique among the uniques;</i> (TA;) <i>one who has no equal; unequalled; incomparable.</i> (IAar, Tes-heel.) It seems that the form of pl. used in the phrase اَحَدُ الاَحَدِينَ is used only as applied to rational beings; but it is said in the Expositions of the Tes-heel that this phrase signifies <i>One of the calamities;</i> the form of the rational pl. being given to nouns significant of things deemed great, mighty, or grievous. (AHeyth.) In the phrase اـِحْدَى الاـِحَدِ, the fem. forms are said to be used for the purpose of giving intensiveness to the signification, as though the meaning were دَاهِيَةُ الدَّوَاهِى, the word داهية being [an intensive epithet] from دَهَا=ءٌ as signifying intelligence, or intelligence mixed with craft or cunning and forecast; or by داهية being meant a calamity. (Expositions of the Fs, TA.) AHei thought اَحَدُ الاَحَدِينَ to be an epithet applied to a male, and اـِحْدَى الاـِحَدِ to be applied to a female: but his opinion has been refuted by EdDemámeenee in the Expos. of the Tes-heel: and this latter author there remarks, that in expressions meant to denote praise [of a man], اَحَدٌ and اـِحْدَى are prefixed to their own proper pls., as اَحَدُونَ and اـِحَدٌ; or to an epithet, as in the case of اَحَدُ العُلَمَا=ءِ [<i>One of the learned</i>]; but that they have not been heard prefixed to generic nouns. (TA.) You say likewise, هُوَ اْبْنُ اـِحْدَاهَا <br>\
                  <i>He is born of noble,</i> or <i>generous, ancestors, both on the father&#39;s and the mother&#39;s side;</i> speaking of a man and of a camel. (L and K in art. وحد.) And لَا يَقُومُ بِهٰذَا الاَمْرِ اـِلَّا اْبْنُ اـِحْدَاهَا <br>\
                  <i>None will manage this thing,</i> or <i>affair, but a noble,</i> or <i>generous, man.</i> (AZ, L in art. وحد.) And ↓ <br>\
      لَا يَسْتَطِيعُهَا <br>\
                  اْبْنُ اـِحْداتِهَا [<i>None will be able to perform it but a noble,</i> or <i>generous, man</i>]. (L in art. وحد.) ―         -b4-  One instance is mentioned, of the occurrence, in a trad., of اـِحْدَى not used as a part of a number [i. e. not as a part of the compound اـِحْدَى عَشْرَةَ] nor as a prefixed noun; viz., اـِحْدَى مِنْ سَبْعٍ [<i>One of seven</i>]; in which سبع is said to mean the nights of &#39;Ád [during which that tribe was destroyed], or the years of Joseph [during which Egypt was afflicted with dearth]. (MF, from the Fáïk &amp;amp;c.) ―         -b5-  Used in a negative phrase, اَحَدٌ signifies <i>Any one with whom one may talk or speak:</i> and in this manner it is used without variation as sing. and pl. and fem. (S) as well as masc. (Msb.) You say, لَا اَحَدَ فِي الدَّارِ [<i>There is not any one in the house</i>]: but you do not say, فِيهَا اَحَدٌ [as meaning the contrary]. (S.) We read in the Kur [lxix. 47, this ex. of its use as a masc. pl.], فَمَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ اَحَدٍ عَنْهُ حَاجِزِينَ [<i>And not any persons of you should have withheld me from</i> punishing <i>him</i>]. (S.) And in the same [xxxiii. 32, we find this ex. of its use as a fem. pl.], لَسْتُنَّ كَاَحَدٍ مِنَ النِّسَا=ءِ [<i>Ye are not like any</i> others <i>of women</i>]. (S.) ―         -b6-  It is also used in interrogative phrases; as in the saying, هَلْ اَحَدٌ <br>\
                  رَاَي مِثْلَ هٰذَا [<i>Has any one seen the like of this?</i>]; (A&#39;Obeyd, L;) and in the saying, يَا حَدْ رَا=هَا [for يَا اَحَدٌ, <i>O, has any one seen her,</i> or <i>it?</i>]. (L, from a trad.) ―         -b7-  It is [said to be] also used in the sense of شَىءٌ [meaning <i>Anything</i>], applied to an irrational being; as in the saying, مَا بِا لدَّارِ مِنْ اَحَدٍ <br>\
                  اـِلَّا حِمَارًا <br>\
                  <i>There is not in the house anything,</i> rational or irrational, <i>except an ass:</i> so that the thing excepted is united in kind to that from which the exception is made [accord. to this rendering; but this instance is generally regarded as one in which the thing excepted is disunited in kind from that from which the exception is made].  (Msb.) So too in the Kur lx. 11, accord. to the reading of Ibn-Mes&#39;ood: (Msb:) but others there read شَىْءٌ, which may mean any one or any thing. (Bd, Jel.) ―         -b8-  الاَحَدٌ, (K,) as also يَوْمَ الاَحَدِ, (S, Msb,) as a proper name, (Msb,) is applied to <i>A certain day;</i> (K;) [<i>Sunday;</i>] <i>the first day of the week;</i> or, as some say, [i. e. as some term it,] <i>the second of the week;</i> (TA;) for the Arabs are said, by IAar, to have reckoned the Sabbath, or Saturday, as the first, though they called Sunday the first of the days: (Msb in art. جمع:) it is sing., and masc.: (Lh:) pl. [as above, i. e.] ا=حَادٌ (S, Msb, K) and اُحْدَانٌ: (K:) or it has no pl. (K: [but in the TA this last observation is very properly restricted, as relating only to اَحَدٌ as syn. with وَاحِدٌ, and as applied to any unknown person.]) In this sense, it has no dim. (Sb, in S, art. امس.) ―         -b9-  الا=حَادُ in lexicology signifies <i>What have been transmitted by some of the lexicologists, but not by such a number of them as cannot be supposed to have agreed to a falsehood:</i> what has been transmitted by this larger number is termed مُتَوَاتِرُ.
