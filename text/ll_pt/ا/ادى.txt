                  , (T, S, M, &amp;amp;c.,) inf. n. تاٌدِيَةٌ (T, S, K) and اَدَا=ءٌ, (T,) or the latter is a simple subst., (S, M, Msb, K,) [and so, accord. to the Msb, is the former also, but this is a mistake,] <i>He made it,</i> or <i>caused it, to reach, arrive,</i> or <i>come</i> [to the appointed person or place &amp;amp;c.]; <i>he brought, conveyed,</i> or <i>delivered, it;</i> syn. اَوْصَلَهُ; (M, Msb, K;) namely, a thing; (M;) as, for instance, الاَمَانَةَ اـِلَى اهْلِهَا [<i>the thing committed to his trust and care, to its owner</i>]: (Msb:) <i>he delivered it, gave it up,</i> or <i>surrendered it:</i> (T:) <i>he payed it,</i> or <i>discharged it;</i> (S, K;) namely, his debt, (S,) a bloodwit, a responsibility, and the like; (Msb in art. غرم;) [and hence,] اَدَّى مَا <br>\
                  عَلَيْهِ [<i>he acquitted himself of that which was incumbent on him;</i> or <i>payed,</i> or <i>discharged, what he owed</i>]: (T:) <i>he performed, fulfilled,</i> or <i>accomplished, it;</i> namely, [for instance,] الحَجَّ [<i>the pilgrimage</i>]; (Msb in art. قضى;) and in like manner, المَنَاسِكَ [<i>the religious rites and ceremonies of the pilgrimage</i>]. (Jel in ii. 196, and Msb ubi suprà.) It is said in the Kur [xliv. 17], اَنْ اَدُّوا اـلَىَّ عِبَادَ اْللّٰهِ, meaning <i>Deliver ye to me</i> [<i>the servants of God,</i>] the children of Israel: or, as some say, the meaning is, اَدُّوا اـِلَىَّ <br>\
                  مَا اَمَرَكُمُ اْللّٰهُ بِهِ يَا عِبَادَاْللّٰهِ [<i>perform ye to me that which God hath commanded you</i> to do, <i>O servants of God</i>]: or it may mean <i>listen ye,</i> or <i>give ye ear, to me;</i> as though the speaker said, اَدُّوا اـِلَىَّ سَمْعَكُمْ; the verb being used in this sense by the Arabs. (T.) And one says, لَهُ ↓ <br>\
      تاَدَّيْتُ, مِنْ حَقِّهِ, (K, TA,) and اـلَيْهِ, in the place of لَهُ, meaning اَدَّيْتُهُ; (TA;) i. e. <i>I payed him his due,</i> or <i>right.</i> (K, TA.) And a man says, ↓ <br>\
      مَا اَدْرِى كَيْفَ اَتَاَدَّى [<i>I know not how to pay</i>]. (TA.) One says also, ادّى عَنْهُ [meaning <i>He payed,</i> or <i>made satisfaction, for him</i>]: and ادّى <br>\
                  عَنْهُ الخَرَاجَ [<i>He payed for him,</i> or <i>in his stead, the land-tax</i>]. (Mgh in art. جزا.) [Hence,] El-Akhnas says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> i. e. <i>But I have put away from me</i> [<i>what I had borrowed,</i> or <i>assumed, of the folishness of youth, and amorous dalliance,</i>] <i>and now I am</i> [or <i>there is at my abode</i>] <i>a keeper and collector to the camels,</i> or <i>cattle,</i> or <i>property.</i> (Ham p. 346.) ―         -b2-  [اَدَّى اـِلى كَذَا is a phrase often used as meaning <i>It brought, conducted, led,</i> or <i>conduced, to such a thing</i> or <i>state;</i> as, for instance, crime to punishment or to ignominy.]    </entryFree> <br>\

                   a subst. from 2 [signifying The <i>act of making,</i> or <i>causing, to reach, arrive,</i> or <i>come</i> to the appointed person or place &amp;amp;c.; <i>of bringing, conveying,</i> or <i>delivering; of giving up,</i> or <i>surrendering; payment,</i> or <i>discharge,</i> of a debt &amp;amp;c.; the <i>act of acquitting oneself</i> of that which is incumbent on him; <i>performance, fulfilment,</i> or <i>accomplishment</i>].

                     ا=دي<br>\
                   [a noun denoting the comparative and superlative degrees, irregularly formed from the verb اَدّى; like as the noun ا=دَى mentioned in art. ادو is irregularly formed from the verb ا=دَى]. You say, هُوَ ا=دَى لِلاَمَانةِ [<i>He is more,</i> or <i>better, disposed to deliver, give up,</i> or <i>surrender, the thing committed to his trust and care</i>] (T, S, M, K) مِنْكَ [<i>than thou</i>], (S,) or مِنْ غَيْرِهِ [<i>than another than he</i>]. (M, * K.) [Az says,] the vulgar say, اَدَّى لِلْاَمَانَةِ; but this is incorrect, and not allowable; and I have not known any one of the grammarians allow ا=دَى, because اَفْعَل denoting wonder [and the comparative and superlative degrees] is not formed but from the triliteral [verb], and one does not say, اَدَى in the sense of اَدَّى: the proper phrase is اَحْسَنُ اَدَا=ءً.
