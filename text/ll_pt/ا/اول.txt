                  <i>he</i> (a man, M) <i>returned,</i> or <i>reverted, from it.</i> (M, K.) ―         -b2-  From ا=لَ as syn. with رَجَعَ is the phrase, فُلَانٌ يَوُولُ اـِلَى كَرَمٍ [meaning either <i>Such a one returns to generosity,</i> or, as كَرَمٌ is used in the sense of كِرَامٌ, <i>is referable to generous,</i> or <i>noble, ancestors</i>]. (TA.) [And hence the phrase,] ا=لَ اـِلَيْهِ بِنَسَبٍ [<i>He bore a relation to him, as a member to a head, by kindred</i>], and بِدِينٍ [<i>by religion</i>]. (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh.) And the saying, in a trad., مَنْ صَامَ الدَّهْرَ فَلَا <br>\

[In the Mgh, art. دهر, for ا=ل I find اَفْطَرَ; and it is there said that this is an imprecation uttered by the Prophet, lest a man should believe  this kind of fasting to be ordained by God; or, through impotence, should become insincere; or because, by fasting all the days of the year, he would do so on the days on which fasting is forbidden. See other readings voce اَلَا in art. الو.]) ―         -b3-  Hence also the saying, ا=لتِ الضَّرْبَهُ اـِلَى <br>\
                  النَّفْسِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>The blow,</i> or <i>stroke, resulted in destroying life; in slaying,</i> or <i>killing.</i> (Mgh.) ―         -b4-  Hence also, ا=لَ الاَمْرُ اـِلَى كَذَا [<i>The affair,</i> or <i>case, became ultimately reduced to such a state,</i>  or <i>condition; came to such a result; came to be thus</i>].

                  <i>He cooked it</i> (namely نَبِيذ [i. e. must, or mead, or wort,]) <i>until it became reduced</i> (رَجَعَ) <i>to the third, or to the fourth:</i> (T:) or, said of the same, (Mgh,) or of medicine, (TA,) حَتَّى ا=لَ <br>\

                  <i>The flesh of the she-camel went away, so that she became lean,</i> or <i>slender and lean,</i> or <i>lean and lank in the belly.</i> (T, K.) ―         -b8-  ا=لَ, (T, S, M, K,) inf. n. اَوْلٌ (T, M, K) and اـِيَالٌ, (M, K,) is also said of tar, (T, S, M,) and of honey, (S,) and of milk, (M,) and of wine, or beverage, (TA,) and of urine, (M,) or of the urine of camels that have been contented with green pasture instead of water, at the end of their being in that state, (T,) and of oil, (M, K,) and other things, (K,) as meaning <i>It became thick:</i> (T, S, M, K:) said of milk, <i>it thickened and coagulated:</i> (M:) said of wine, or beverage, <i>it thickened, and became intoxicating in its utmost degree:</i> (Az, TA:) and said of oil, <i>it attained its full perfume,</i> or <i>sweetness of odour, by being well prepared</i> or <i>compounded.</i> (T.) ―         -b9-  مَا لَكَ تَوُولُ اـِلَى كَتِفَيْكَ [written in the TA without any vowel-signs, app. meaning (tropical:)  <i>What aileth thee that thou shruggest thy shoulders?</i> lit., <i>drawest thyself together to thy two shoulder-blades?</i>] is said [to a man] اـِذَا <br>\
                  اْنْضَمَّ اـِلَيْهِمَا وَاْجْتَمَعَ [when he draws himself together to them, and contracts himself]; and is a tropical phrase: so says Z. (TA.) ―         -b10-  ا=لَ مِنْ <br>\

It is said in a prov., (M,) قَدْ اُلْنَا وَاـِيلَ عَلَيْنَا (T, S, M) <i>We have ruled and been ruled;</i> (T;) <i>we have presided and been presided over.</i> (M.) ―         -b2-  ا=لَ مَالهُ, (T, S, M, * Msb, K,) inf. n. اـِيَالَةٌ, (T, Msb,) <i>He put into a good,</i> or <i>right, state,</i> or <i>condition, and managed,</i> or <i>tended, his</i> <br>\

[But see another reading in the first paragraph of art. اوي.]) You say also, اُلْتُ الشَّىْءَ meaning <i>I composed,</i> or <i>collected together, the thing, and put it into a good, right,</i> or <i>proper, state,</i> or <i>condition:</i> and some of the Arabs say, اْللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ ↓ <br>\

(T.) ―         -b3-  اُلْتُ الاـِبلَ, inf. n. اَوْلٌ and اـِيَالٌ, also signifies <i>I drove the camels:</i> (M:) or, accord. to the T, <i>I bound the camels&#39; udders with the</i> <br>\

(T.) ―         -b2-  See also 1, near the end of the paragraph, in two places. ―         -b3-  تَاْوِيلٌ also signifies The <i>discovering, detecting, revealing, developing,</i> or <i>disclosing,</i> or the <i>explaining, expounding,</i> or <i>interpreting, that to which a thing is,</i> or <i>may be, reduced,</i> or <i>that which it comes,</i> or <i>may come, to be:</i> (S, O, TA:) you say, اَوَّلْتُهُ, inf. n. تَاْوِيلٌ; and ↓ <br>\

      تاوَّل: (so in a copy of the T: [the former word being, accord. to this reading, a contraction of تَتَاَوَّلُ; but this does not altogether agree with what here follows:]) AO says, تَاَوُّلُ حُبِّهَا means تَفْسِيرُهُ وَمَرْجِعُهُ: [i. e., the explanation of her love, or of the (poet&#39;s) love of her, and the state, or condition, to which it eventually came, is this:] (S:) it was small in his heart, and ceased not to grow until it became great; like as the little young camel [born in the season called ربيع, or in the beginning of the breeding-time,] ceases not to grow until he becomes great like his mother, (T, * S,) and has a son accompanying him: (S:) [or] اوّلهُ and ↓ <br>\
      تاوّلهُ, (M, K,) inf. n. of the former as above, (K,) when said of language, signify دَبَّرَهُ وَقَدَّرَهُ وَفَسَّرَهُ [<i>he considered its end,</i> or <i>what it might be to which it led or pointed, and compared one part of it with another, and</i> then <i>explained,</i> or <i>expounded,</i> or <i>interpreted, it</i>]: (M, K:) hence, [if the explanation in the M and K be meant to denote three distinct meanings, which I do not think to be the case,] it would seem as though تَاْوِيلٌ and تَفْسِيرٌ were syn.; but accord. to other authorities, they differ: (TA:) [Az says,] accord. to Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà, these two words and مَعْنًى are all one: but تاويل seems to me to signify the <i>collecting the meanings of dubious expressions by such expression as is clear,</i> or <i>plain, without dubiousness:</i> or, accord. to Lth, it is the <i>interpreting of language that has different meanings; and this cannot be rightly done but by an explanation which changes the expression;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      تاَوُّلٌ: (T:) or the <i>turning a verse of the Kur-án from its apparent meaning to a meaning which it bears,</i> or <i>admits, when the latter is agreeable with the Scripture and the Sunneh:</i> for instance, in the words of the Kur [vi. 95, &amp;amp;c.], يُخْرِجُ اْلْحَىَّ مِنَ المَيِّتِ, if the meaning be [thus explained] “He produceth the bird from the egg,” this is تفسير: and if [it be explained as meaning] “He produceth the believer from the unbeliever,” or “the knowing from the ignorant,” this is تاويل: so says Ibn-El-Kemál: (TA:) [hence, although it may often be rendered by <i>interpretation,</i> like تفسير, it more properly signifies the <i>rendering in a manner not according to the letter,</i> or <i>overt sense; explaining the covert,</i> or <i>virtual,</i> <br>\
                  <i>meaning; interpreting in a manner not according to the obvious meaning:</i>] or the <i>reducing a thing to its ultimate intent, whether it be a saying or an action:</i> (Er-Rághib, TA:) or تفسير signifies the “discovering, detecting, revealing, or disclosing, what is meant by a dubious expression;” and تاويل, the <i>reducing one of two senses,</i> or <i>interpretations, which an expression bears,</i> or <i>admits, to that which suits the apparent meaning:</i> (L and K in art. فسر, and TA in that and in the present art.:) or the former signifies the “expounding, explaining, or interpreting, the narratives which occur collected without discrimination in the Kur-án, and making known the significations of the strange words or expressions, and explaining the occasions on which the verses were revealed;” and the latter, the <i>explaining the meaning of that which is</i> <br>\
                  مُتَشَابِهِ, [or <i>what is equivocal,</i> or <i>ambiguous,</i>] i. e., <i>what is not understood without repeated consideration.</i> (TA: [in which are some further explanations; but these add nothing of importance.]) ―         -b4-  [Hence, اوّل لَفْظًا, in grammar, <i>He rendered a word,</i> or <i>an expression,</i> or <i>a phrase, in grammatical analysis, by another word,</i> or <i>expression,</i> or <i>phrase.</i>] ―         -b5-  And [hence likewise,] تَاْوِيلٌ signifies also The <i>interpretation,</i> or <i>explanation,</i> of a dream; the <i>telling the final sequel,</i> or <i>result,</i> thereof: (M, K:) as in the Kur xii. 101. (M.) ―         -b6-  It is also used [as a simple subst.] to signify The <i>end, issue, result,</i> or <i>final sequel,</i> of a thing; syn. عَاقِبَةٌ; (Bd in iv. 62 and xvii. 37;) or ↓ <br>\
      مَا=لٌ; (Jel in the same places;) or مَرْجِعٌ, and مَصِيرٌ; as in the Kur [iii. 5], وَمَا <br>\

                  اَحْسَنُ تَاْوِيلًا means <i>The fear of God is best in respect of result;</i> syn. عَاقِبَةً. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  شَخْص; for the ا=ل of everything is its شخص; and that the سراب [in appearance] lowers every شخص in it so that it becomes [as though it were] cleaving to the ground, having no شخص: Yoo says, the Arabs say that <i>the</i> <br>\

                  ضُحَى [explained above]; and the سراب is that which is upon the surface of the ground, as though it were water, and is at midday: and this, I [namely Az] say, is what I have found the Arabs in the desert to say: (T:) El- Hareeree speaks of the glistening of the ا=ل; app. using this word in the sense of سراب; for it is the latter that glistens; not the former: (Har p. 363:) the word is masc. and fem. (Msb, K.) The phrase يَرفَعُ اْلْا=لَا, ending a verse (S, M) of En-Nábighah, (M, TA,) i. e.
