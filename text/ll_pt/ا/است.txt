                  , signifying The <i>podex,</i> or the <i>anus,</i> (K,) or signifying the former, and sometimes used as meaning the latter, (S in art. سته,) is with a conjunctive hemzeh, [written اْسْتٌ, when not immediately preceded by a quiescence,] and its final radical letter is clided; for the original form is سَتَهٌ; (Msb;) and it is mentioned in art. سته. (K.) [It is of the fem. gender.] It is said in a prov., applied to him who fails of attaining the object that he seeks, اَخْطَاَتِ اْسْتُهُ الحُفْرَةَ [<i>His anus missed the hole in the ground</i>]. (Meyd.) — [Hence,] اِسْتُ الدَّهْرِ (tropical:)  <i>The first,</i> or <i>beginning, of time;</i> (A;) <i>old,</i> or <i>ancient, time.</i> (IB, A, * K. *) One says, مَا زَالَ عَلَى اْسْتِ الدَّهْرِ مَجْنُونًا (tropical:)  [<i>He ceased not,</i> or <i>has not ceased, from the beginning of time,</i> or <i>from old time, to be insane,</i> or <i>mad;</i> or] <i>he always was,</i> or <i>always has been, known as being insane,</i> or <i>mad:</i> like as one says, عَلَى اـِسِّ <br>\

(AZ, S.) IB says, J has erred in mentioning است in this section [of the S]; its proper place being in art. سته, where he has also mentioned it; for its hemzeh is conjunctive, by common consent; and if conjunctive, it is augmentative: also, his saying that they have changed the [final] س in اـِسٌّ into ت, like as they have changed the [final] س of طَسٌّ into ت, making this word طَسْتٌ, is a mistake; for, were it so, the hemzeh of است would be disjunctive [in every case; whereas it is always conjunctive except after a pause, when it is pronounced with kesr]: moreover, he has attributed this assertion to AZ, who never made it, but only mentioned است الدهر with اسّ الدهر because of their agreement in meaning. (TA.) ―         -b2-  [Hence also,] اِسْتُ الكَلْبَةِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Calamity,</i> or <i>misfortune:</i> (K:) <i>adversity; difficulty; distress; affliction:</i> (TA:) <i>what is hated, disliked, disapproved, foul, abominable,</i> or <i>evil.</i> (K.) ―         -b3-  And اِسْتُ المَتْنِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The desert:</i> (K:) or <i>the wide desert.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  See also art. سته.    </entryFree> <br>\
