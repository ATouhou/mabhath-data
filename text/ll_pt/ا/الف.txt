      ا=لفهُ, aor. يُوَالِفُ, inf. n. مُوَالَفَةٌ and اـِلَافٌ: (S, Msb, TA:) [<i>he frequented it, or resorted to it habitually;</i> namely, a place:] <i>he became familiar with it; or accustomed,</i> or <i>habituated, to it;</i> namely, a thing: (AZ, T:) <i>he became familiar, sociable, companionable, friendly,</i> or <i>amicable, with him:</i> (AZ, T, Msb:) <i>he loved,</i> or <i>affected, him; liked, approved,</i> or <i>took pleasure in, him.</i> (Msb.)

                  <i>The gazelles kept to the sands.</i> (T.) ―         -b2-  There are three manners of reading the passage in the Kur [evi. 1 and 2], قُرَيْشٍ اـِيلَافِهِمْ رِحْلَةَ الشِّتَا=ءِ وَ الصَّيْفِ ↓ <br>\
      لِاـِيلَافِ; the second and third being لِاـِلَافِ and لِاـِلْفِ; the first and second of which have been adopted; (Aboo-Is-hák, T, TA;) and the third also; this being the reading of the Prophet [himself]: (TA:) [accord. to all these readings, the passage may be rendered, <i>For the keeping of Kureysh, for their keeping to the journey of the winter and of the summer,</i> or <i>spring;</i> the chapter going on to say, for this reason &quot;let them worship the Lord of this House,&quot; &amp;amp;c. : or] the second and third readings are from اَلِفَ, aor. يَاْلَفُ; [and accord. to these readings, the passage may be rendered as above;] but accord. to the first reading, the meaning is, <i>for the preparing and fitting out</i> [&amp;amp;c.; i. e., <i>preparing and fitting out men and beasts in the journey of the winter</i> &amp;amp;c.]: so says IAmb; and Fr explains in the same manner the third reading: but IAar says that, accord. to this reading, the meaning is, <i>the protecting</i> [&amp;amp;c.]: he says that the persons who protected were four brothers, Háshim and &#39;Abd-Shems and El-Muttalib and Nowfal, the sons of &#39;Abd-Menáf: these gave protection to Kureysh in their procuring of corn: (T:) Háshim obtained a grant of security from the king of the Greeks, and Nowfal from Kisrà, and &#39;Abd-Shems from the Nejáshee, and ElMuttalib from the kings of Himyer; and the merchants of Kureysh used to go to and from the great towns of these kings with the grants of security of these brothers, and none opposed them: Háshim used to give protection (يُوْلِفُ [in the copies of the K يُوَلِّفُ]) [to those journeying] to Syria, and &#39;Abd-Shems to Abyssinia, and ElMuttalib to El-Yemen, and Nowfal to Persia: (T, K: *) or ↓ <br>\
      اـِيلَاف in the Kur signifies <i>a covenant,</i> or <i>an obligation;</i> and <i>what resembles permission,</i> (اـِجَازَة, as in some copies of the K and in the TA,) or <i>protection,</i> (اـِجَارَة, as in the CK,) <i>with an obligation involving responsibility for safety;</i> first obtained by Háshim, from the kings of Syria; (K, * TA;) and the explanation is, that Kureysh were dwelling in the sacred territory, (K,) having neither seed-produce nor udders [to yield them milk], (TA,) secure in the procuring of their provisions from other parts, and in their changes of place, in winter and summer, or spring; the people around them having their property seized; whereas, when any cause of mischief occurred to them, they said, &quot;We are people of the sacred territory,&quot; and then no one opposed them: (K:) so in the O: (TA:) or the ل is to denote wonder; and the meaning is, <i>wonder ye at the</i> <br>\
                  ايلاف <br>\
                  <i>of Kureysh</i> [&amp;amp;c.]: (K:) some say that the meaning is connected with what follows; i. e., let them worship the Lord of this House for the ايلاف [&amp;amp;c., agreeably with the first explanation which we have given]: others, that it is connected with what precedes; as J says; (TA;) the meaning being, I have destroyed the masters of the elephant <i>to make Kureysh remain</i> at Mekkeh, and <i>for their uniting the journey of the winter and of the summer,</i> or <i>spring;</i> that when they finished one, they should commence the other; (T, S;) and this is like the saying, ضَرَبْتُهُ لِكَذَا ضَرَبْتُهُ لِكَذَا َ لِكَذَا, with suppression of the [conjunctive] و: (S:) but Ibn-&#39;Arafeh disapproves of this, for two reasons: first, because the phrase &quot;In the name of God&quot; &amp;amp;c. occurs between the two chapters: [Bd, however, mentions that in Ubeí&#39;s copy, the two compose one chapter:] secondly, because ايلاف signifies the <i>covenants,</i> or <i>obligations, which they obtained when they went forth on mercantile expeditions, and whereby they became secure.</i> (TA.) ↓ <br>\
      اـِلَافٌ [in like manner] signifies <i>A writing of security, written by the king for people, that they may be secure in his territory:</i> and is used by Musáwir Ibn-Hind in the sense of اِيتِلَافٌ [as is also اـِلْفٌ,] when he says, in satirizing Benoo-Asad, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> meaning <i>Ye asserted [that your brothers are Kureysh;</i> i. e.,] <i>that ye are like Kureysh:</i> but how should ye be like them? for <i>they have</i> [an <i>alliance whereby they are protected in</i>] the <i>trade</i> of El-Yemen and Syria; <i>and ye have not</i> that [<i>alliance</i>]. (Ham p. 636.) [Hence,] اـِلَافُ اْللّٰهِ [a phrase used in the manner of an oath,] accord. to some, signifies <i>The safeguard,</i> or <i>protection, of God:</i> or, accord. to others, <i>an honourable station from God.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  اَلَفَهُ, aor.      <br>\

(T, TA.) ―         -b3-  تَاْلِيفٌ is The <i>putting many things into such a state that one name becomes applicable to them, whether there be to some of the parts a relation to others by precedence and sequence, or not:</i> so that it is a more general term than تَرْتِيبٌ: (KT:) or the <i>collecting together,</i> or <i>putting together, suitable things;</i> from الالفة [i. e. الاُلْفَةُ]; and is a more particular term than تَرْكِيبٌ, which is the putting together things, whether suitable or not, or placed in order or not.
