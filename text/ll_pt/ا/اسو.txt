                  كَفَافٍ [<i>May God have mercy on a man who has given of superabundance, and imparted of food only sufficient for his want so as to make himself equal with him to whom he imparts of such food</i>]: (TA:) [and ا=ساهُ signifies <i>he shared with him:</i> and <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, equal with him:</i> for] المُوَاسَاةُ occurs often in trads., signifying the <i>sharing with another,</i> or <i>making another to share with one, in the means of subsistence</i> [<i>&amp;amp;c.</i>]; and is originally [المُوَاسَاةُ,] with ء: also, the <i>being,</i> or <i>becoming, equal with another:</i> (TA:) and you say, ا=سَيْتُهُ بِنَفْسِي, meaning <i>I made him equal with myself;</i> in the dial. of El-Yemen وَاسَيْتُهُ. (Msb.) ا=سِ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ فِى وَجْهِكَ, in a letter of &#39;Omar, means <i>Make thou the people to share</i> [<i>alike</i>], <i>one with another, in thy consideration and regard:</i> or, as some say, <i>make thou them equal</i> [<i>in respect thereof</i>]. (Mgh.) The saying مَا يُوَاسِي فُلَانٌ فُلَانًا is explained in three different ways: accord. to El-Mufaddal Ibn-Mohammad, it means <i>Such a one does not make such a one to share with him:</i> accord. to El-Muärraj, <i>does not good to such a one;</i> from the saying of the Arabs, ا=سِ فُلَانًا بِخَيْرٍ <br>\
                  <i>Do thou good to such a one:</i> or, as some say, <i>does not give such a one any compensation for his love,</i> or <i>affection, nor for his relationship;</i> from الاَوْسُ, meaning العَوْضُ; being originally يُوَاوِسُهُ, then يُوَاسِوُهُ, and then يُوَاسِيهِ: or it may be from اَسَوْتُ الجُرْحَ.
