(TA.) [It is also said of other things, as will be shown by phrases here following, and by explanations of اَطِيطٌ below.] You also say, اَطَّتِ <br>\

                  <i>I will not come to thee as long as camels utter cries</i> [or <i>moan</i>] <i>by reason of the heaviness of their loads.</i> (S.) And لَا اَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ مَا اَطَّتِ الاـِبِلُ, meaning <i>I will not do that ever.</i> (TA.) And مَا لَنَا بَعِيرٌ يَيِطُّ <br>\
                  <i>We have not a camel that moans,</i> or <i>cries;</i> meaning <i>we have not any camel;</i> for the camel cannot but do so. (TA, from a trad.) [See also اَطِيطٌ, below.] And اَطَّتْ لَهُ رَحِمِى (tropical:)  [<i>My feeling of relationship,</i> or <i>sympathy of blood,</i>] <i>became affected with tenderness,</i> or <i>compassion,</i> and <i>became moved,</i> [or rather <i>pleaded,</i>] <i>for him</i> [or <i>in his favour</i>]: (K, TA:) and hence ↓التَّاَطُّطُ [inf. n. of the verb in the syn. phrase تَاَطَّطَتْ لَهُ رَحِمِى]. (Sgh, TA.) And اَطَّتْ بِكَ الرَّحِمُ [<i>The feeling of relationship,</i> or <i>sympathy of blood, pleaded,</i> or <i>hath pleaded, in thee;</i>] i. e., <i>inclined thee to favour.</i> (Ham p. 765.)
