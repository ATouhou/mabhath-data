                     ذ<br>\
                  , (S, Msb, K,) originally اَخَوٌ, (Kh, S, Msb,) as is shown by the first of its dual forms mentioned below, and by its having a pl. like ا=بَا=ءٍ, (S,) and اَخٌّ, (K,) with the second letter doubled to compensate for the و suppressed, as is the case in اَبٌّ, (TA,) and ↓ <br>\
      اَخًا, [like اَبًا,] and ↓ <br>\
      اَخُو, (IAar, K, TA, [the last, with the article prefixed to it, erroneously written in the CK الاُخُوٌّ,]) and ↓ <br>\
      اَخْوٌ, like دَلْوٌ, (Kr, K,) a well-known term of relationship, (K, TA,) i. e. <i>A brother; the son of one&#39;s father and mother, or of either of them:</i> and also applied to <i>a foster-brother:</i> (TA:) and (assumed tropical:) <i>a friend; and a companion, an associate, or a fellow:</i> (K:) derived from ا=خِيَّةٌ [q. v.]; as though one اَخ were tied and attached to another like as the horse is tied to the ا=خيّة: (Har p. 42 :) or, accord. to some of the grammarians, it is from وَخَى meaning قَصَدَ; because the اَخ has the same aim, endeavour, or desire, as his اَخ: (TA:) when اَخ is prefixed to another noun, its final vowel is prolonged: (Kh:) you say, هذَا اَخُوكَ [<i>This is thy brother,</i> &amp;amp;c.], and مَرَرْتُ بِاَخِيكَ [<i>I passed by thy brother,</i> &amp;amp;c.], and رَاَيْتُ اَخَاكَ [<i>I saw thy brother,</i> &amp;amp;c.] : (S: [in which it is also asserted that one does not say اَخُو without prefixing it to another noun; but this is inconsistent with the assertion of IAar and F, that الاَخُو is a syn. of الاَخُ:]) the dual is اَخَوَانِ, (S, Msb, Kur xlix. 10, Ham p. 434,) or اَخْوَانِ, with the خ quiescent, (TA, [but this I have found nowhere else,]) and some of the Arabs say اَخَانِ, (S, Msb,) and Kr mentions اَخُوَانِ, with damm to the خ, said by IB to occur in poetry, and held by ISd to be dual of اَخُو, with damm to the خ: (TA:) the pl. is اـِخْوَةٌ and اـِخْوَانٌ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.,) the former generally applied to <i>brothers,</i> and the latter to <i>friends</i> [or <i>the like</i>], (T, S,*) but not always, as in the Kur xlix. 10, where the former does not denote relationship, and in xxiv. 60 of the same, where the latter does denote relationship, (T, TA,) and sometimes the former is applied to a [single] man, as in the Kur iv. 12, (S,) and اُخْوَةٌ, (Fr, S, Msb, K, [in the CK اَخْوَةٌ,]) or this is a quasi-pl. n., (Sb, TA,) and اُخْوَانٌ, (Kr, Msb, K,) and ا=خَا=ءٌ, (S, K,) like ا=بَا=ءٌ, (S,) and اُخُوٌّ, and اُخُوَّةٌ, (ISd, K,) the last mentioned by Lh, and thought by ISd to be formed from the next preceding by the addition of ة characterizing the pl. as fem., (TA,) and اَخُونَ, (S, Msb, K,) and اخاوون. (Msb: [there written without any syll. signs, and I have not found it elsewhere.]) The fem. of اَخٌ is ↓ <br>\
      اُخْتٌ [meaning <i>A sister:</i> and (assumed tropical:)  <i>a female friend,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c. :) written with damm to show that the letter which has gone from it is و; (S;) the ت being a substitute for the و; (TA;) not to denote the fem. gender, (K, TA,) because the letter next before it is quiescent: this is the opinion of Sb, and [accord. to SM] it is the correct opinion: for Sb says that if you were to use it as a proper name of a man, you would make it perfectly decl.; and if the ت were to denote the fem. gender, the name would not be perfectly decl.; though in one place he incidentally says that it is the sign of the fem. gender, through inadvertence: Kh, however, says that its ت is [originally] ه [meaning ة]: and Lth, that اُخْتٌ is originally اَخَةٌ: and some say that it is originally اَخْوَةٌ: (TA:) the dual. is اُخْتَانِ: (Kh:) and the pl. is اَخَوَاتٌ. (Kh, S, Msb, K.) The saying لَا اَخَالَكَ بِفُلَانٍ [<i>Thou hast no brother,</i> or (assumed tropical:) <i>friend, in such a one</i>] means لَيْسَ لَكَ بِاَخٍ [<i>such a one is not a brother,</i> or <i>friend, to thee</i>]. (S, K.) It is said in a prov., مَنْ لَكَ بِاَخِيكَ كُلِّهِ [<i>Who will be responsible to thee for thy brother,</i> or (assumed tropical:)  <i>thy friend, altogether?</i> i. e., for his always acting to thee as a brother, or friend]. (JK.) And in another, رُبَّ اَخٍ لَكَ لَمْ تَلِدْهُ اُمُّكَ [(assumed tropical:)  <i>There is many a brother to thee whom thy mother has not brought forth</i>]. (TA.) And in another, اَخُوكَ اَمِ الذَّيْبُ [<i>Is it thy brother,</i> or <i>the wolf?</i>]; said in suspecting a thing: as also اَخُوكَ اَمِ اللَّيْلُ [<i>Is it thy brother, or is it the night</i> that deceives thee?]. (Har p. 554.) And another saying is, الرُّمْحُ اَخُوكَ <br>\
                  وَرُبَّمَا خَانَكَ [(assumed tropical:) <i>The spear is thy brother, but sometimes, or often, it is unfaithful to thee</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  Ibn-&#39;Arafeh says that when اُخُوَّةٌ does not relate to birth, it means conformity, or similarity; and combination, agreement, or unison, in action: hence the saying, هذَا الثَّوْبُ اَخُو هذَا [(assumed tropical:) <i>This garment, or piece of cloth, is the like, or fellow, of this</i>] : and hence the saying in the Kur [xvii. 29], كَانُوا اـِخْوَانَ الشَّيَاطِينِ  (assumed tropical:)  <i>They are the likes, or fellows, of the devils:</i> and in the same [xliii. 47], ↓ <br>\
      اـِلَّا هِىَ اَكْبَرُ مِنْ اُخْتِهَا (assumed tropical:)  <i>But it was greater than its like, or fellow;</i> i. e., than what was like to it in truth &amp;amp;c. (TA.) It is said in a trad., النَّوْمُ <br>\
                  اَخُ المَوْتِ [<i>Sleep is the like of death</i>]. (El-Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer.) One says also, لَقِىَ فُلَانٌ اَخَا المَوْتِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Such a one met with the like of death.</i> (Msb, TA.) And they said, لَهَا ↓ <br>\
      وَمَاهُ ا=للّٰهُ بِلَيْلَپٍ لَا اُخْتَ [(assumed tropical:)  <i>God afflicted him with a night having none like to it</i>], i. e., a night in which he should die. (TA.) And لَا اُكَلِّمُهُ اـِلَّا اَخَا السِّرارِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>I will not speak to him save the like of secret discourse.</i> (As, TA.) [And hence,] سُهَيْلٍ ↓ <br>\

                  الغُمَيْصَا=ءُ. (S and K in art. شعر, q. v.) ―         -b3-  يَاَ اَخَا بَكْرٍ, or تَمِيمٍ, means (assumed tropical:)  <i>O thou of</i> [the tribe of] <i>Bekr,</i> or <i>Temeem.</i> (Ham p. 284.) ―         -b4-  Lh mentions, on the authority of Abu-d-Deenár and Ibn-Ziyád, the saying, القُمْمُ بِاَخِى الشَّرَّ, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>The people, or company of men, are in an evil state or condition.</i> (TA.) [But accord. to others,] one says, تَرَكْتُهُ بِاَخِى الخَيْرِ, meaning (tropical:)  <i>I left him in an evil state or condition:</i> (JK, * Msb, K, TA:) and بِاَخِى الشَّرِّ (tropical:)  <i>in a good state or condition.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  You say also, هُوَاَخُو الصَّدْقِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He is one who cleaves,</i> or <i>keeps, to veracity.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b6-  [اِخُو, as a prefixed noun, is also used in the sense of اَهْلُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Worthy, or deserving,</i> of a thing: and <i>meet, fit,</i> or <i>fitted,</i> for it. So in the phrase اَخُو ثِقَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Worthy,</i> or <i>deserving, of trust,</i> or <i>confidence;</i> expl. by W (p. 91) as meaning <i>a person in whom one trusts,</i> or <i>confides.</i> And so in the prov., لَيْسَ اَخُو الكِظَاظِ مَنْ يَسْاَمُهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He who is fit,</i> or <i>fitted, for vehement striving for the mastery is not he who turns away from it with disgust:</i> see art. كظ.] ―         -b7-  It is also used in the sense of ذُو: as in the phrase, هُوَاَخُو الغِنَى [(assumed tropical:)  <i>He is possessed,</i> or <i>a possessor, of wealth,</i> or <i>competence,</i> or <i>sufficiency</i>]. (Msb.) [So too in the phrase, اَخُو الخَيْرِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Possessed,</i> or <i>a possessor, of good,</i> or <i>of what is good.</i> And in like manner,] اَخُو الخَنَعِ means [ذُو الخَنَعِ, i. e. ذُو الذِّلَّةِ, i. e.] الّذَّلِيلُ [(assumed tropical:)  <i>The low, base,</i> or <i>abject</i>]. (Ham p. 44.) [So too] سَيْرُنَا <br>\
                  اَخُو الجِيْدِ means [سَيْرُنَا ذُوالجَيْدِ, i. e.] سَيْرُنَا جَاهِدٌ <br>\

                  , (Lth, S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.,) originally of the measure فَاعُولَةٌ, [i. e. ا=خُويَةٌ,] (Msb,) and ا=خِيَةٌ, (Lth, Msb, K,) and اَخِيَّةٌ, (JK, K, TA, [but in the K the orthography of these three words is differently expressed in different copies, and somewhat obscurely in all that I have seen,]) <i>A piece of rope of which the two ends are buried in the ground,</i> (ISk, JK, S,) <i>with a small staff</i> or <i>stick, or a small stone, attached thereto,</i> (ISK, S,) <i>a portion thereof, resembling a loop, being apparent, or exposed, to which the beast is tied;</i> (ISk, JK, S;) it is made in soft ground, as being more commodious to horses than pegs, or stakes, protruding from the ground, and more firm in soft ground than the peg, or stake: (TA:) or <i>a loop tied to a peg,</i> or <i>stake, driven</i> [<i>into the ground</i>], <i>to which the beast is attached:</i> (Msb:) or <i>a stick, or piece of wood,</i> (K, TA,) <i>placed crosswise</i> (TA) <i>in a wall,</i> or <i>in a rope of which the two ends are buried in the ground, the [other] end [or portion] protruding, like a ring, to which the beast is tied:</i> (K, TA:) or <i>a peg, or stake, to which horses are tied:</i> (Har p. 42:) [see also ا=رِىُّ:] the pl. of the first is اَوَاخِىُّ; (JK, S, Msb, K;*) and of the second, اوَاخٍ; (Msb;) and of the third, اَخَايَا, (JK, K,*) like as خَطَايَا is pl. of خَطِيَّةٌ. (TA.) In a trad., the believer and belief are likened to a horse attached to his ا=خيّة; because the horse wheels about, and then returns to his ا=خيّة; and the believer is heedless, and then returns to believe. (TA.) And in another, men are forbidden to make their backs like the اَخَايَا of beasts; i. e., in prayer; meaning that they should not arch them therein, so as to make them like the loops thus called. (TA.) ―         -b2-  Also <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  طُنُبٌ; (K;) i. e. The <i>kind of tent-rope thus called.</i> (TA in art. طنب, q. v.) ―         -b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  <i>A sacred, or an inviolable, right</i> or <i>the like;</i> syn. حُرْمَةٌ and ذِمَّةٌ. (S, K.) You say, لِفُلَانٍ اَوَاخِىُّ <br>\
                  وَاَسْبَابٌ تُرْعَى [(assumed tropical:)  <i>To such a one belong sacred, or inviolable, rights, and ties of relationship and love, to be regarded</i>]. (S.) And لَهُ عِنْدِى ا=جِيَّةٌ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He has, with me,</i> or <i>in my estimation, a strong, sacred, or inviolable, right;</i> and <i>a near tie</i> or <i>connexion,</i> or <i>means of access</i> or <i>intimacy</i> or <i>ingratiation.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  In a trad. of &#39;Omar, in which it is related that he said to El-&#39;Abbás, اَنْتَ ا=خِيَّةُ ا=بَا=ءِ رَسُولِ اَللّٰهِ, it is used in the sense of بَقِيَّةَ; [and the words may therefore be rendered <i>Thou art the most excellent of the ancestors of the Apostle of God;</i>] as though he meant, thou art he upon whom one stays himself, and to whom one clings, of the stock of the Apostle of God.
