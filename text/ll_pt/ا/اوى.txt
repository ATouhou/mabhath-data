      اِيتَوَى, (M, K,) both of the measure افتعل; (TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      ا=وَى is used by some in the same sense, but rejected, in this sense, by several; (Msb;) the pronoun relating to a place of abode; (T, S, M, Msb, K;) <i>He betook himself to it,</i> or <i>repaired to it, for lodging, covert,</i> or <i>refuge;</i> (Mgh;) and [simply] <i>he got him</i> or <i>got himself, betook himself, repaired,</i> or <i>resorted, to it;</i> (T, Mgh;) <i>he returned to it;</i> (M;) <i>he took up his abode in it; he lodged,</i> or <i>abode,</i> or <i>dwelt, in it.</i> (Msb, K.)

                  جَبَلٍ يَعْصِمُنِى مِنَ المَا=ءِ [<i>I will betake myself for refuge to a mountain that shall preserve me from the water</i>]. (S.) الاُوِىُّ properly relates to living beings; but is used otherwise, metaphorically. (M.) In the saying of Lebeed, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

(M. [But see another reading near the end of the first paragraph of art. اول.]) اَوَى, aor. as above, inf. n. اُوِىٌ, also signifies <i>He turned away:</i> and hence, [it is said,] اـِذْ اَوَى الفِتْيَةُ اـِلَى الكَهْفِ [<i>When the young men turned away to the cave:</i> though the verb may be here well rendered <i>betook themselves for refuge</i>]. (Har p. 246.) You say also, اَوَيْتُ اـِلَى فُلَانٍ, (A&#39;Obeyd, T,) or لَهُ, (as afterwards written in a copy of the T,) [<i>I betook myself to such a one,</i> or <i>repaired to him, for lodging, covert,</i> or <i>refuge;</i> or] <i>I joined myself, got myself, betook myself, repaired,</i> or <i>resorted, to such a one:</i> and accord. to AHeyth, اَوَيْتُ <br>\
                  فُلَانًا signifies the same; but he did not know اَوَيْتُ to be syn. with ا=وَيْتُ as explained below. (T.) And اَوَى اـِلَى اْللّٰهِ <br>\
                  <i>He returned unto God.</i> (TA, from a trad.) ―         -b2-  اَوَى said of a wound: see 5.       -A2-  See also 4, in seven places.       -A3-  اَوَى لَهُ, (T, S, M, Mgh, K,) like رَوَى, (K, TA,) but it would have been more explicit if the author of the K had said like رَمَى, (TA,) [as is shown by the false reading in the CK, اوِىَ لَهُ كَرَوِىّ,] aor. يَاوِى, (T, S, Mgh,) inf. n. اَوْيَةٌ (S, K) and اـِيَّةٌ, (S, Mgh, K,) with kesr, (TA,) [originally اـِوْيَةٌ,] the و being changed into ى because of the kesreh before it, (S,) or because combined with ى and preceded by sukoon [a mistake for “kesreh”], (IB as cited in the TA,) [in a copy of the T written ايَّة, and in a copy of the M and in the CK اَيَّة,] and مَاْوِيَةٌ, (S, M, K,) without teshdeed, (S, TA,) [in my copy of the Mgh written with tesh-deed,] and مَاْوَاهٌ, (S, M, K,) <i>He compassionated him; felt compassion,</i> or <i>pity, for him;</i> (T, S, M, Mgh, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      ايتوى, (T, K,) of the measure افتعل. (TA.) In using the imperative form, you say, اِوِ لَهُ, [unless this be a mistranscription for اِيوِ لَهُ,] meaning <i>Be thou compassionate to him.</i> (T, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
