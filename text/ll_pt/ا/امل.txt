                  , (so in the M accord. to the TT,) inf. n. اَمَلٌ, (T, S, M, &amp;amp;c.,) this being the inf. n. accord. to IJ, [as distinguished from اَمْلٌ and اـِمْلٌ,] (M,) <i>He hoped it;</i> or <i>hoped for it;</i> syn. رَجَاهُ; (S, * M, * [see اَمَلٌ below,] K;) meaning, what was good for him; (S;) as also ↓ <br>\
      امَلهُ, (T, * M, K,) inf. n. تَاميلٌ: (S, T:) or <i>he expected it;</i> [or <i>had a distant,</i> or <i>remote, expectation of it;</i> for] it is mostly used in relation to that of which the occurrence, or coming to pass, is deemed remote; as in the saying of Zuheyr, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>I hope, and have a distant expectation, that her love may approach</i>]: he who has determined upon a journey to a distant town or country says, اَمَلْتُ الوُصُولَ [<i>I have formed an expectation,</i> or <i>a distant expectation, of arriving</i>]; but he does not say, طَمِعْتُ until he has become near thereto; for طَمَعٌ relates only to that of which the occurrence, or coming to pass, is [deemed] near: and الرَّجَا=ءُ is between الاَمَلُ and الطَّمَعُ; for it is sometimes attended with fear that the thing expected may not come to pass, wherefore it is used in the sense of fear; and when the fear is strong, [lest the thing expected should not come to pass, it denotes distant expectation, and thus] it is used in the sense of الاَمَلُ; whence the usage in the verse of Zuheyr; but otherwise it is used in the sense of الطَّمَعُ: (Msb:) or الرجاء signifies the expectation of benefit, or advantage, from some preceding cause or means: so says El-Harállee: or it is properly syn. with الاَمَلُ; and in common conventional language, means the clinging of the heart to the coming to pass of a future desired event: so says Ibn-El-Kemál: or, accord. to Er-Rághib, an opinion requiring the coming to pass of an event in which will be a cause of happiness: (TA:) and ↓ <br>\
      امّلهُ, inf. n. تَاْمِيلٌ, signifies <i>he expected it much;</i> and is more commonly used than the form without teshdeed. (Msb.)    </entryFree> <br>\
