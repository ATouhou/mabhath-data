                  <i>The first letter of the alphabet</i> [according to the order in which the letters are now commonly disposed; and also according to the original order, which see in art. ابجد]: called اَلِفٌ. [This name, like most of the other names of Arabic letters, is traceable to the Phœnician language, in which it signifies “an ox;” the ancient Phœnician form of the letter thus called being a rude representation of an ox&#39;s head.] It is, of all the letters, that which is most frequent in speech: and some say that, in ا=ل=م=, in the Kur [ch. ii. &amp;amp;c.], it is a name of God. (TA.) Its name is properly fem., as is also that of every other letter; [and hence its pl. is اَلِفَاتٌ;] but it may be made masc.: so says Ks: Sb says that all the letters of the alphabet are masc. and fem., like as الِّسَانٌ is masc. and fem. (M.) As a letter of the alphabet, it is abbreviated, [or short, and is written ا, as it also is generally when occurring in a word, except at the end, when, in certain cases, it is written ى,] and is pronounced with a pause after it: and it is also prolonged: (S, K, * TA:) [in the latter case, it is written ا=ءٌ; and] this is the case when it is made a subst.: and when it is not called a letter, [i. e. when one does not prefix to it the word حَرْف,] it is [properly] fem. (S.) Its dim. is اُيَيَّةٌ, meaning <i>an</i> <br>\
                  اء <br>\
                  <i>written small,</i> or <i>obscure,</i> (S, IB,) according to those who make it fem. and who say, زَيَّيَتُ زَايًا and ذَيَّلْتُ ذَالًا; but اُوَيَّةٌ according to those who say, زَوَّيْتُ زَايًا. (IB.)       -A2-  اَلِفٌ [properly so called] is <i>one of the letters of prolongation</i> and <i>of softness</i> and <i>of augmentation;</i> the letters of augmentation being ten, which are comprised in the saying, اليَوْمَ تَنْسَاهُ [“to-day thou wilt forget it”]. (S.) There are two species of الف; namely, لَيِّنَةٌ [or <i>soft</i>], and مُتَحَرِّكَةٌ [or <i>movent</i>]; the former of which is [properly] called اَلِفٌ; and the latter, هَمْزَةٌ; (S, TA;) which is a faucial letter, pronounced in the furthest part of the fauces [by a sudden emission of the voice after a total suppression, so that it resembles in sound a feebly-uttered ع whence the form of the character (ء) whereby it is represented]: but this latter is sometimes tropically called الف; and both [as shown above] are of the letters of augmentation. (S in art. او, and TA.) There are also two other species of الف; namely, اَلِفُ وَصْلٍ [<i>the alif of conjunction</i> or <i>connexion,</i> or <i>the conjunctive</i> or <i>connexive alif</i>]; and اَلِفُ قَطْعٍ [<i>the alif of disjunction,</i> or <i>the disjunctive alif</i>]; every one that is permanent in the connexion of words being of the latter species; and that which is not permanent, [i. e. which is not pronounced, unless it is an alif of prolongation,] of the former species; and this is without exception augmentative; [but it is sometimes a substitute for a suppressed radical letter, as in اْبْنٌ, originally بَنَىٌ or بَنَوٌ;] whereas the alif of disjunction is sometimes augmentative, as in the case of the interrogative alif [to be mentioned below, and in other cases]; and sometimes radical, as in اَخَذَ and اَمَرَ: (S, TA:) or, according to Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà and Mohammad Ibn-Yezeed, (T, TA,) the primary اَلِفَات are three; the rest being subordinate to these: namely, اَلِفٌ اَصْلِيَّةٌ [<i>radical alif</i>], (T, K, TA,) as in اـِلْفٌ and اَكَلَ (T) and اَخَذَ; (K;) and اَلِفٌ قَطْعِيَةٌ [<i>disjunctive alif</i>], as in اَحْمَدُ (T, K) and اَحْمَرُ (T) and اَحْسَنَ; (T, K;) and اَلِفٌ وَصْلِيَّةٌ [<i>conjunctive</i> or <i>connexive alif</i>], (T, K,) as in اْسْتَخْرَاجٌ (T) and اْسْتَخْرَجَ. (T, K.) ―         -b2-  The اَلِف which is one of the letters of prolongation and of softness is called الاَلِفُ الهَادِيَةُ [<i>the quiescent alif,</i> and الاَلِفُ السَّاكِنَةُ, which signifies the same]: (MF, TA:) it is an aerial letter, (Mughnee, MF, TA,) merely a sound of prolongation after a fet-hah; (T, TA;) and cannot have a vowel, (IB, Mughnee, MF,) wherefore it cannot commence a word: (Mughnee:) when they desire to make it movent, if it is converted from و or ى, they restore it to its original, as in عَصَوَانِ and رَحَيَانِ; and if it is not converted from و or ى, they substitute for it hemzeh, as in رَسَايِلُ, in which the hemzeh is a substitute for the ا in [the sing.] رَسَالَةٌ. (IB.) IJ holds that the name of this letter is لَا, [pronounced <i>lá</i> or <i>lé,</i> without, or with, imáleh, like the similar names of other letters, as بَا and تا and ثَا &amp;amp;c.,] and that it is the letter which is mentioned [next] before ى in reckoning the letters; the ل being prefixed to it because it cannot be pronounced at the beginning of its name, as other letters can, as, for instance, ص and ج; and he adds that the teachers [in schools] err in pronouncing its name لَامَ اْلِفْ. (Mughnee.) ―         -b3-  The grammarians have other particular appellations for alifs, which will be here mentioned. (T, TA.) ―         -b4-  الاَلِفُ المَجْهُولَةُ [<i>The unknown alif</i>] is such as that in فَاعِلٌ [or فَاعَلَ] and فَاعُولٌ; i. e., every ا, (T, K,) of those having no original [from which they are converted, not being originally ا nor و nor ى, but being merely a formative letter, and hence, app., termed “unknown”], (T,) inserted for the purpose of giving fulness of sound to the fet-hah in a verb and in a noun; (T, K;) and this, when it becomes movent, becomes و, as in the case of خَاتَمٌ and خَوَاتِمُ, becoming و in this case because it is movent, and followed by a quiescent ا, which ا is the ا of the pl., and is also مجهولة. (T.) ―         -b5-  اَلِفَاتُ المَدَّاتِ [<i>The alifs of prolongations</i>] are such as those [which are inserted for the same purpose of giving fulness of sound to the fet-hah] in كَلْكَالٌ, for كَلْكَلٌ, and خَاتَامٌ, for خَاتَمٌ, and دَانَاقٌ, for دَانَقٌ. (T, K.) In like manner, و is inserted after a dammeh, as in اَنْظُورُ; and ى after a kesreh, as in شِيمَالٌ. (TA.) An alif of this species is also called اَلِفُ الاـِشْبَاعِ [<i>The alif added to give fulness of sound</i> to a fet-hah preceding it]: and so is the alif in مَنَا used in imitation [of a noun in the accus. case; as when one says, رَاَيْتُ رَجُلًا (pronounced رَجُلَا) “I saw a man,” and the person to whom these words are addressed says, مَنَا <br>\
                  <i>Whom?</i>]. (Mughnee.) ―         -b6-  اَلِفُ الصِّلَةِ [<i>The alif of annexation,</i> or <i>the annexed alif,</i>] is that which is an annex to the fet-hah of a rhyme, (T, K,) and to that of the fem. pronoun هَا: in the former case as in <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        بَانَتْ سُعَادُ وَاَمْسَى حَبْلُهَا اْنْقَطَعَا<br>\
                  </quote> in which ا is made an annex to the fet-hah of the ع [of the rhyme]; and in the saying in the Kur [xxxiii. 10], وَتَظُنُّونَ بِاْللّٰهِ الظُّنُونَا, in which the ا after the last ن is an annex to the fet-hah of that ن; and in other instances in the final words of verses of the Kur-án, as قَوَارِيرَ and سَلْسَبِيلَا [in lxxvi. 15 and 18]: in the other case as in ضَرَبْتُهَا and مَرَرْتُ بِهَا. (T.) The difference between it and اَلِفُ الوَصْلِ is, that the latter is in the beginnings of nouns and verbs, and the former is in the endings of nouns [and verbs]. (T, K.) It is also called اَلِفُ الاـِطْلَاقِ [<i>The alif of unbinding,</i> because the vowel ending a rhyme prevents its being مُقَيّد, i. e. “bound” by the preceding consonant]: (Mughnee;) and اَلِفُ الفَاصِلَةِ [<i>the alif of the final word of a verse of poetry</i> or <i>of a verse of the Kur-án</i> or <i>of a clause of rhyming prose</i>]. (TA.) [This last appellation must not be confounded with that which here next follows.] ―         -b7-  الاَلِفُ الفَاصِلَةِ [<i>The separating alif</i>] is the ا which is written after the و of the pl. to make a separation between that و and what follows it, as in شَكَرُوا (T, K) and كَفَرُوا, and in the like of يَغْزُوا and يَدْعُوا [and يَرْضَوْا]; but when a pronoun is affixed to the verb, this ا, being needless, does not remain: (T:) also the ا which makes a separation between the ن which is a sign of the fem. gender and the heavy [or doubled] ن [in the corroborated form of the aor. and imperative], (T, K,) because a triple combination of ن is disliked, (T,) as in [يَفْعَلْنَانِّ and تَفْعَلْنَانِّ and] اِفْعَلْنَانِّ (T, K) and لَا تَفْعَلْنَانِّ. (T.) ―         -b8-  اَلِفُ النُّونِ الخَفِيفَةِ [<i>The alif of the light,</i> or <i>single, noon</i> in the contracted corroborated form of the aor. and imperative], as in the phrase in the Kur [xcvi. 15], لَنَسْفَعًا بِالنَّاصِيَةِ [explained in art. سفع], (T, K,) and the phrase [in xii. 32], وَلَيَكُونًا مِنَ الصَّاغِرِينَ [<i>And he shall assuredly be of those in a state of vileness,</i> or <i>ignominy</i>], in both of which instances the pause is made with ا [only, without tenween, so that one says لَنَسْفَعَا and لَيَكُونَا, and this seems to be indicated in Expositions of the Kur-án as the proper pronunciation of these two words in the phrases here cited, the former of which, and the first word of the latter,  I find thus written in an excellent copy of the Mughnee, with a fet-hah only instead of tenween, though I find them written in copies of the Kur-án and of the K with tenween, and for this reason only I have written them therewith in the first places above], this ا being a substitute for the light ن, which is originally the heavy ن: and among examples of the same is the saying of El-Aashà, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَلَاتَحْمِدَ المُثْرِينَ وَاْللّٰهَ فَاْحْمَدَا<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>And praise not thou the opulent, but God do thou praise</i>], the poet meaning فَاْحْمَدَنْ, but pausing with an ا: (T:) and accord. to &#39;Ikrimeh Ed-Dabbee, in the saying of Imra-el-Keys, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        قَفَا نَبْكِ مِنْ ذِكَري حَبِيبٍ وَمَنْزِلِ<br>\
                  </quote> [what is meant is, <i>Do thou pause that we may weep by reason of the remembrance of an object of love, and of a place of abode,</i> for] the poet means قِفَنْ, but substitutes ا for the light ن; (TA;) or, accord. to some, قفا is in this case [a dual] addressed to the poet&#39;s two companions. (EM p. 4.) ―         -b9-  اَلِفُ العِوَضِ [<i>The alif of exchange</i>] is that which is substituted for the tenween (T, K) of the accus. case when one pauses upon it, (T,) as in رَاَيْتُ زَيْدَا (T, K [and so in the copy of the Mughnee mentioned above, but in the copies of the T I find زَيْدًا,]) and فَعَلْتُ خَيْرَا and the like. (T.) ―         -b10-  اَلِفُ التَّعَايِى [<i>The alif of inability to express what one desires to say</i>], (T,) or اَلِفَ التَغَابِى [<i>the alif of feigning negligence</i> or <i>heedlessness</i>], (K,) [but the former is evidently, in my opinion, the right appellation,] is that which is added when one says اـِنَّ عُمَرَ, and then, being unable to finish his saying, pauses, saying اـِنَّ عُمَرَا, [in the CK عُمَرَا=,] prolonging it, desiring to be helped to the speech that should reveal itself to him, (T, K,) and at length saying مُنْطَلِقٌ, meaning to say, if he were not unable to express it, اـِنَّ عُمَرَ مُنْطِلَقٌ [<i>Verily &#39;Omar is going away</i>]. (T.) The ا in a case of this kind is [also] said to be لِلتَّذَكُّرِ [<i>for the purpose of endeavouring to remember</i>]; and in like manner, و, when one desires to say, يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ, and, forgetting زيد, prolongs the sound in endeavouring to remember, and says يَقُومُو. (Mughnee in the sections on ا and و.) It is also added to a curtailed proper name of a person called to, or hailed, as in يَا عُمَا for يَا عُمَرُ [which is an ex. contrary to rule, as عُمَرُ is masc. and consists of only three letters]. (T.) ―         -b11-  اَلِفُ النُّدْبَةِ [<i>The alif of lamentation</i>], as in وَا زَيْدَاهْ [<i>Alas, Zeyd!</i>], (T, K,) i. e. the ا after the د; (T;) and one may say وَا زَيْدَا, without the ه of pausation. (Alfeeyeh of Ibn-Málik, and I &#39;Ak p. 272.) ―         -b12-  اَلِفُ الاِْسْتِنْكَارِ [<i>The alif of disapproval</i>], (T,) or الاَلِفُ لِلْاـِنْكَارِ [which means the same], (Mughnee,) is similar to that next preceding, as in اَاَبُو عُمَرَاهّ [<i>What! Aboo- &#39;Omar?</i>] in reply to one who says, “Aboo-&#39;Omar came;” the ه being added in this case after the letter of prolongation like as it is in وَا فُلَانَاهْ said in lamentation. (T.) [The ex. given in the Mughnee is ا= عَمْرَاهْ, as said in reply to one who says, “I met &#39;Amr;” and thus I find it written, with ا=; but this is a mistranscription of the interrogative اَ, which see below.] In this case it is only added to give fulness of sound to the vowel; for you say, اَلرَّجُلُوهْ [<i>What! the man?</i> for اَاْلرَّجُلُوهْ,] after one has said “The man stood;” and اَلرَّجُلَاهْ in the accus. case; and اَلرَّجُلِيهْ in the gen. case. (Mughnee in the section on و. [But in my copy of that work, in these instances, the incipient ا, which is an ا of interrogation, is written ا=.]) ―         -b13-  الاَلِفُ المُنْقَلِبَةُ عَنْ يَا=ءِ الاـِضَافَةِ [<i>The alif that is converted from the affixed pronoun</i> <br>\
                  ى], as in يَا غُلَامَا اَقْبِلْ [<i>O my boy, advance thou,</i>] for يَا غُلَامِى; (TA in art. حرز;) [and يَاعَجَبَا لِزَيْدٍ (I &#39;Ak p. 271) <i>O my wonder at Zeyd!</i> for يا عَجَبِى لزيد;] and in يَا اَبَتَا for يَا اَبَتِى, and يَا وَيْلَتَا for يَا وَيْلَتِى, and يَابِاَبَا and يَا بِاَبَاهْ for يَا بِاَبِى (T and TA in art. با.) [This is sometimes written ى, but preceded by a fet-hah.] ―         -b14-  الاَلِفُ المُحَوَّلَةُ [<i>The transmuted alif,</i> in some copies of the K اَلِفُ المُحَوَّلَةِ, which, as MF observes, is put for the former,] is every ا that is originally و or ى (T, K) movent, (T,) as in قَالَ [originally قَوَلَ], and بَاعَ [originally بَيَعَ], (T, K,) and غَزَا [originally غَزَوَ], and قَضَى [originally قَضَى], and the like of these. (T.) ―         -b15-  اَلِفُ التَثْنِيَةِ [<i>The alif of the dual,</i> or rather, <i>of dualization</i>], (T, K,) in verbs, (TA,) as in يَجْلِسَانِ and يَذْهَبَانِ, (T, K,) and in nouns, (T,) as in الزَّيْدَانِ (T, K) and العَمْرَانِ; (T;) [i. e.] the ا which in verbs is a dual pronoun, as in فَعَلَا and يَفُعَلَانِ, and in nouns a sign of the dual and an indication of the nom. case, as in رَجُلَانِ. (S.) ―         -b16-  It is also indicative of the accus. case, as in رَاَيْتُ <br>\
                  فَاهُ [<i>I saw his mouth</i>]. (S.) ―         -b17-  اَلِفُ الجَمْعِ [<i>The alif of the plural,</i> or <i>of pluralization</i>], as in مَسَاجِدُ and جِبَالٌ (T, K) and فُرْسَانٌ and فَوَاعِلُ. (T.) ―         -b18-  اَلِفُ التَّاْنِيثِ [<i>The alif denoting the fem. gender</i>], as in حُبْلَى (Mughnee, K) and سَكْرَى [in which it is termed مَقْصُورَة <br>\
                  <i>shortened</i>], and the meddeh in حَمْرَا=ءُ (K) and بَيْضَا=ءُ and نُفَسَا=ءُ [in which it is termed مَمْدُودَة <br>\
                  <i>lengthened</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b19-  اَلِفُ الاـِلْحَاقِ [<i>The alif of adjunction,</i> or <i>quasi-coordination; that which renders a word an adjunct to a particular class,</i> i. e. <i>quasi-coordinate to another word, of which the radical letters are more in number than those of the former word,</i> (see the sentence next following,)], (Mughnee, TA,) as in اَرْطًا (Mughnee) [or اَرْطًى; and the meddeh in عِلْبَا=ءٌ &amp;amp;c.]. ―         -b20-  اَلِفُ التَكْثِيرِ [<i>The alif of multiplication,</i> i. e. <i>that merely augments the number of the letters of a word without making it either fem.</i> or <i>quasi-coordinate to another, unaugmented, word</i>], as in قَبَعْثَرَى (Mughnee, TA) [correctly قَبَعْثَرًى], in which the ا [here written ى] is not to denote the fem. gender, (S and K in art. قبعثر,) because its fem. is قَبَعْثَرَاةٌ, as Mbr. says; (S and TA in that art.;) nor to render it quasi-coordinate to another word, (K and TA in that art.,) as is said in the Lubáb, because there is no noun of six radical letters to which it can be made to be so; but accord. to Ibn-Málik, a word is sometimes made quasi-coordinate to one comprising augmentative letters, as اِقْعَنْسَسَ is to اِحْرَنْجَمَ. (TA in that art.)       -A3-  اَلِفَاتُ الوَصْلِ [<i>The alifs of conjunction</i> or <i>connexion,</i> or <i>the conjunctive</i> or <i>connexive alifs</i>], (T, K,) which are in the beginnings of nouns, (T,) [as well as in certain well-known cases in verbs,] occur in اْبْنٌ (T, K) and اْبْنُمٌ (K) and اْبْنَةٌ and اْثْنَانِ and اْثْنَتَانِ and اْمْرُوٌ and اْمْرَاَةٌ and اْسْمٌ and اْسْتٌ, (T, K,) which have a kesreh to the ا when they commence a sentence, [or occur alone, i. e., when immediately preceded by a quiescence,] but it is elided when they are connected with a preceding word, (T,) [by which term “word” is included a particle consisting of a single letter with its vowel,] and اْيْمُنٌ and اْيْمُ [and variations thereof, which have either a fet-hah or a kesreh to the ا when they commence a sentence, or occur alone], (K,) and in the article اْلْ, the ا of which has a fet-hah when it commences a sentence. (T.)       -A4-  اَلِفُ القَطْعِ [<i>The alif of disjunction,</i> or <i>the disjunctive alif,</i>] is in the beginnings of sing. nouns and of pl. nouns: it may be known by its permanence in the dim., and by its not being a radical letter: thus it occurs in اَحْسَنُ, of which the dim. is اُحَيْسِنُ: (I Amb, T:) in pls. it occurs in اَلْوَانٌ and اَزْوَاجٌ (I Amb, T, K) and اَلْسِنَةٌ [&amp;amp;c.]: (I Amb, T:) [it also occurs in verbs of the measure اَفْعَلَ, as اَكْرَمَ; in which cases it is sometimes لِلسَّلْبِ, i. e. <i>privative,</i> (like the Greek alpha,) as in اَقْسَطَ “he did away with injustice,” which is termed قُسُوطٌ and قَسْطٌ, inf. ns. of قَسَطَ:] it is distinguished from the radical ا, as shown above: (I Amb, T:) or it is sometimes augmentative, as the interrogative اَ [to be mentioned below]; and sometimes radical, as in اَخَذَ and اَمَرَ; and is thus distinguished from the conjunctive ا, which is never other than augmentative. (S.) ―         -b2-  اَلِفُ التَّفْضِيلِ وَ التَّقْصِيرِ [<i>The alif denoting excess and deficiency,</i> i. e., <i>denoting the comparative and superlative degrees</i>], as in فُلَانٌ اَكْرَمُ <br>\
                  مِنْكَ [<i>Such a one is more generous,</i> or <i>noble, than thou</i>], (T, K, *) and اَلْاَمُ مِنْكَ [<i>more ungenerous,</i> or <i>ignoble, than thou</i>], (T,) and اَجْهَلُ النَّاسِ [<i>the most ignorant of men</i>]. (T, K. *) ―         -b3-  اَلِفُ العِبَارَةِ [<i>The alif of signification</i>], (T, K,) as though, (T,) or because, (TA,) significant of the speaker, (T, TA,) also called العَامِلَةِ [<i>the operative</i>], as in اَنَا اَسْتَغْفِرُ اْللّٰهَ [<i>I beg forgiveness of God</i>], (T, K,) and اَنَا اَفْعَلُ كَذَا [<i>I do thus</i>]. (T.) ―         -b4-  اَلِفُ الاِْسْتِفْهَامِ [<i>The alif of interrogation,</i> or <i>the interrogative alif</i>], (T, S, Msb in art. همز, Mughnee,) as in اَزَيْدٌ قَايِمٌ [<i>Is Zeyd standing?</i>], (Mughnee,) and اَزَيْدٌ عِنْدَكَ اَمْ عَمْرٌو [<i>Is Zeyd with thee,</i> or <i>at thine abode, or &#39;Amr?</i>], (S,) and اَقَامَ زَيْدٌ [<i>Did Zeyd stand?</i>], said when the asker is in ignorance, and to which the answer is لَا or نَعَمْ; (Msb;) and in a negative phrase, as اَلَمْ نَشْرَحْ [<i>Did we not dilate,</i> or <i>enlarge?</i> in the Kur xciv. 1]. (Mughnee.)  When this is followed by another hemzeh, an ا is interposed between the two hemzehs, [so that you say اَااَنْتَ, also written ا=اَنْتَ,] as in the saying of Dhu-r-Rummeh, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  <i>Art thou indeed Joseph?</i>] It is sometimes used to make a person acknowledge, or confess, a thing, (T, Msb in art. همز, Mughnee,) and to establish it, (Msb,) as in the phrase in the Kur [v. 116], اَاَنْتَ قُلْتَ لِلنَّاسِ or ا=اَنْتَ [<i>Didst thou say to men?</i>], (T,) and اَلَمْ نَشْرَحْ [explained above], (Msb in art. همز,] and in اَضَرَبْتَ زَيْدًا or اَاَنْتَ ضَرَبْتَ [<i>Didst thou beat Zeyd?</i>], and اَزَيْدًا ضَرَبْتَ [<i>Zeyd didst thou beat?</i>]. (Mughnee.) And for reproving, (T, Mughnee,) as in the phrase in the Kur [xxxvii. 153], اصْطَفَى <br>\
                  اْلْبَنَاتِ عَلَى اْلْبَنِينَ [<i>Hath He chosen daughters in preference to sons?</i>], (T,) [but see the next sentence,] and [in the same ch., verse 93,] اَتَعْبُدُونَ مَا <br>\
                  تَنْحِتُونَ [<i>Do ye worship what ye hew out?</i>]. (Mughnee.) And to express a nullifying denial, as in [the words of the Kur xvii. 42,] اَفَاَصْفَاكُمْ <br>\
                  رَبَّكُمْ بِاْلْبَنِينَ وَاْتَّخَذَ مِنَ اْلْمَلَايِكَةِ اـِنَاثًا [<i>Hath then your Lord preferred to give unto you sons, and gotten for himself, of the angels, daughters?</i>]. (Mughnee.) And to denote irony, as in [the Kur xi. 89,] اَصَلَوَاتُكَ تَاْمُرُكَ اَنْ نَتْرُكَ مَا يَعْبُدُ ا=بَاوُنَا [<i>Do thy prayers enjoin thee that we should leave what our fathers worshipped?</i>]. (Mughnee.) And to denote wonder, as in [the Kur xxv.47,] اَلَمْ تَرَ <br>\
                  اـِلَى رَبِّكَ كَيْفَ مَدَّ اْلظِّلَّ [<i>Hast thou not considered</i> the work of <i>thy Lord, how He hath extended the shade?</i>]. (Mughnee.) And to denote the deeming a thing slow, or tardy, as in [the Kur lvii., 15,] اَلَمْ يَاْنِ لِلّذِينَ ا=مَنُوا [<i>Hath not the time yet come for those who have believed?</i>]. (Mughnee.) And to denote a command, as in [the Kur iii. 19,] اَاَسْلَمْتُمْ, meaning اَسْلِمُوا [<i>Enter ye into the religion of El-Islám</i>]. (Mughnee, and so Jel.) And to denote equality, occurring after سَوَا=ءٌ and مَا اُبَالِى and مَا اَدْرِى and لَيْتَ شِعْرِى, and the like, as in [the Kur lxiii.6,] سَوَا=ءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ اَسْتَغْفَرْتَ لَهُمْ اَمْ لَمْ <br>\
                  تَسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ [It will be <i>equal to them whether thou beg forgiveness for them or do not beg forgiveness for them</i>], and in ،َا اُبَالِى اَقُمْتَ اَمْ قَعَدْتَ [<i>I care not whether thou stand or sit</i>]: and the general rule is this, that it is the hemzeh advening to a phrase, or proposition, of which the place may be supplied by the inf. n. of its verb; for one may say, سَوَا=ءٌ عَلَيْهِمُ اْلاِْسْتِغْفَارُ وَعَدَمُهُ [<i>Equal to them</i> will be <i>the begging of forgiveness and the not doing so</i>], and مَا اَبَالِى بِقِيَامِكَ وَعَدَمِهِ [<i>I care not for thy standing and thy not doing so</i>]: (Mughnee.) ―         -b5-  اَلِفُ النِّدَا=ءِ [<i>The alif of calling,</i> or <i>vocative alif</i>], (T, S,* Mughnee,* K,) as in اَزَيْدُ, meaning يَا زَيْدُ [<i>O Zeyd</i>], (T, K,) and in اَزَيْدُ اَقْبِلْ [<i>O Zeyd, advance</i>], (S,) used in calling him who is near, (S, Mughnee,) to the exclusion of him who is distant, because it is abbreviated. (S.) ا= with medd, is a particle used in calling to him who is distant, (Mughnee, K,) as in ا=َزَيْدُ اَقْبِلْ [<i>Ho there,</i> or <i>soho,</i> or <i>holla, Zeyd, advance</i>]. (TA.) Az says, You say to a man, in calling him, ا=فُلَانُ and اَفُلَانُ and ا=يَا فُلَانُ (TA) or اَيَا. (S and K in art. ايا.) ―         -b6-  اـِاْللّٰهِ, for اـِىْ وَاْللّٰهِ: see اـِى. ―         -b7-  In a dial. of some of the Arabs, hemzeh is used in a case of pausing at the end of a verb, as in their saying to a woman, قُولِيْ [<i>Say thou</i>], and to two men, قُولَاْ [<i>Say ye two</i>], and to a pl. number, قُولُوْ [<i>Say ye</i>]; but not when the verb is connected with a word following it: and they say also لَاْ, with a hemzeh, [for لَا,] in a case of pausation. (T.) But Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà says, All men say that when a hemzeh occurs at the end of a word, [i. e. in a case of pausation,] and has a quiescent letter before it, it is elided in the nom. and gen. case, though retained in the accus. case [because followed by a quiescent ا], except Ks alone, who retains it in all cases: when it occurs in the middle of a word, all agree that it should not be dropped. (T.) AZ [however] says that the people of El-Hijáz, and Hudheyl, and the people of Mekkeh and ElMedeeneh, do not pronounce hemzeh [at all]: and &#39;Eesà Ibn-’Omar says, Temeem pronounce hemzeh, and the people of El-Hijáz, in cases of necessity, [in poetry,] do so. (T.) ―         -b8-  Ks cites, [as exhibiting two instances of a rare usage of اَا, or ا=, in a case of pausing, in the place of a suppressed word,] <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
