                  , (so in some copies of the S and in the M,) accord. to Sb, or اُلَا, (so likewise in the M, in which it is mentioned in art. الى, [and thus it is always pronounced,]) or اُولَى; (so in several copies of the S and in the K, in the last division of each of those works, [and thus it is generally written;]) and with the lengthened ا, [and this is the more common form of the word, i. e. ↓ <br>\
      اُلَا=ءِ, as it is always pronounced, or اُولَا=ءِ, as it is generally written, both of which modes of writing it I find in the M.,] (S, M, K,) of the same measure as غُرَاب, (M,) indecl., with a kesreh for its termination; (S;) [<i>These</i> and <i>those,</i>] a pl. having no proper sing., (S, K,) or a noun denoting a pl., (M,) or its sing. is ذَا for the masc. and ذِهْ for the fem., (S, K,) for it is both masc. and fem., (S,) and is applied to rational beings and to irrational things. (M.) [Thus,] هُمْ اُولَا=ءِ عَلَى اَثَرِى, in the Kur xx. 86, means [<i>They are these, following near after me;</i> or] <i>they are near me, coming near after me.</i> (Jel, and Bd says the like.) And in the same, iii. 115, هَااَنْتُمْ اُولَا=ءِ تُحِبُّونَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِبُّونَكُمْ <br>\
                  <i>Now ye,</i> O ye <i>these</i> believers, <i>love them, and they love not you.</i> (Jel.) ―         -b2-  The particle (M) هَا (S, K) used as an inceptive to give notice of what is about to be said is prefixed to it, [i. e., to the form with the lengthened ا,] (S, M, K,) so that you say, ↓ <br>\
      هوُلَا=ءِ [meaning <i>These,</i> like as هذَا means “this”]. (S, K.) And AZ says that some of the Arabs say, هوَلَا=ءِ قَوْمُكَ [<i>These are thy people</i>], (S, M, *) and ↓ <br>\
      رَاَيْتُ هوُلَا=ءٍ [<i>I saw these</i>], (M,) with tenween and kesr (S, M) to the hemzeh; (S;) and this, says IJ, is of the dial. of Benoo-&#39;Okeyl. (M.) ―         -b3-  And the ك of allocution is added to it, so that you say, اُوليِكَ, [or ا=ُولَا=يِكَ, which is the same, and اُوليِكُمْ, or اُولَا=يِكُمْ, &amp;amp;c.,] and اُولَاكَ, (S, K,) and اُولَالِكَ, (so in some copies of the S and in the K,) or اُلَالِكَ, (so in some copies of the S and in the M,) in which the [second] ل is augmentative, (M,) and ↓ <br>\
      اُلَّاكَ, with teshdeed, (K,) [all meaning <i>Those,</i> like as ذَاكَ and ذلِكَ mean “that” and hence] Ks says that when one says اُولَا=يكَ, the sing. is ذلِكَ; and when one says اُولَاكَ, the sing. is ذَاكَ; (S;) or اُلَالِكَ [or اُولَالِكَ, each with an augmentative ل, like ذلِكَ, (and this, I doubt not, is the correct statement,)] is as though it were pl. of ذلِكَ: (M:) but one does not say هَاوُلَالِكَ, or هاُولَالِكَ, (M,) [nor هَوُلَايِكَ, or the like.] [Thus it is said in the Kur ii. 4, اُولَا=يِكَ عَلَ هُدًى مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَاُولَا=يِكَ هُمُ <br>\
                  المُفْلِحُونَ <br>\
                  <i>Those follow a right direction from their Lord, and those are they who shall prosper.</i>] And sometimes اُولَا=يِكَ is applied to irrational  things, as in the phrase بَعْد اُولَا=يِكَ الاَيَّامِ [<i>After those days</i>]; and in the Kur [xvii. 38], where it is said, اـِنَّ السَّمْعَ وَالْبَصَرَ وَالْفُوَادَ كُلُّ اُولَا=يِكَ <br>\
                  كَانَ عَنْهُ مَسْوُولًا [<i>Verily the ears and the eyes and the heart, all of those shall be inquired of</i>]. (S.) ―         -b4-  The dims. are ↓ <br>\
      اـُلَيَّا and ↓ <br>\
      اُلَيَّا=ءِ (S, M) and ↓ <br>\
      هوُلَيَّا=ءِ: (M:) for the formation of the dim. of a noun of vague application does not alter its commencement, but leaves it in its original state, with fet-h or damm, [as the case may be,] and the ى which is the characteristic of the dim. is inserted in the second place if the word is one of two letters, [as in the instance of ذَيَّا, dim. of ذَا,] and in the third place if it is a word of three letters. (S.)       -A2-  الاُلَى, (as in some copies of the S and T,) of the same measure as العُلَى; (S; [wherefore the author of the TA prefers this mode of writing it, which expresses the manner in which it is always pronounced;]) or الاُلَا; (ISd, TA;) or الاُولَى; (so in some copies of the S and T;) is likewise a pl. having no proper sing., [meaning <i>They who, those which,</i> and simply <i>who,</i> and <i>which,</i>] its sing. being الَّذِى; (S;) or is changed from being a noun of indication so as to have the meaning of الَّذِينَ; as also ↓ <br>\
      الاُلَا=ءِ; wherefore they have the lengthened as well as the shortened alif, and that with the lengthened alif is made indecl. by terminating with a kesreh. (ISd.) A poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>And they who are in Et-Taff, of the family of Háshim, shared their property, one with another, and so set the example, to the generous, of the sharing of property</i>]. (T, and S in art.    </entryFree> <br>\

                  </quote> [<i>And verily they who know thee, of them</i>]: which shows what has been said above, respecting the change of meaning. (ISd.) Ziyád El-Aajam uses the former of the two words without ال, saying, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

(Ham p. 678; where, instead of فانتم and اولى, we find وَاَنْتُمُ and اُلَا.) ―         -b2-  In the phrase العَرَبُ الاُولَى, (as in the L, and in some copies of the S and K,) or الاُلَى, (as also in the L, and in other copies of the S and K, [and thus it is always pronounced,]) الاولى or الالى may also signify الَّذِينَ, the verb سَلَفُوا being suppressed after it, because understood; [so that the meaning is, <i>The Arabs who have preceded,</i> or <i>passed away;</i>] so says Ibn-EshShejeree: (L:) or it is formed by transposition from الاُوَلُ, being pl. of اُولَى [fem. of اَوَّلُ], like as اُخَرُ is pl. of ا=خَ: and it is thus in the phrase, ذَهَبَتِ العَرَبُ الاُولَى or الاُلَى [<i>The first Arabs have passed away</i>]. (S, K.) &#39;Obeyd Ibn-ElAbras uses the phrase, نَحْنُ الاُلَى [as meaning <i>We are the first</i>]. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
