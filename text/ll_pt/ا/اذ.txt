<b>اـِذْ</b>               1     <br>\
                     اـِذْ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                   a word denoting past time: (Lth, T, S, M, L, Mughnee, K:) it is a noun, (S, L, Mughnee, K,) indecl., with its last letter quiescent; and properly is prefixed to a proposition; (S, L, K;) as in جِيْتُكَ اـِذْ قَامَ زَيدٌ [<i>I came to thee when Zeyd stood</i>], and اـِذْ زَيْدٌ قَايِمٌ and اـِذْ زَيْدٌ يقُومُ [<i>When Zeyd was standing</i>]. (S, L.) The proposition to which it is prefixed is either nominal, as in [the words of the Kur viii. 26,] وَاْذْكُرُوا اـِذْ اَنْتُمْ قَلِيلٌ [<i>And remember ye when ye were few</i>]; or verbal, having the verb in the pret. as to the letter and as to the meaning, as in [the Kur ii. 28, &amp;amp;c.,] وَاـِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَايِكَةِ [<i>And when thy Lord said unto the angels</i>]; or verbal with the verb in the pret. as to the meaning but not as to the letter, as in [the Kur ii. 121,] وَ اـِذْ يَرْفَعُ اـِبْرٰهِيمُ القَوَاعِدَ [<i>And when Abraham was rearing the foundations</i>]; all three of which kinds are comprised in the Kur where it is said, [ix. 40,] اـِلَّا تَنْصُرُوهُ فَقَدْ <br>\
                  نَصَرَهُ اْللّٰهُ اـِذْ اَخْرَجَهُ اْلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ثَانِىَ اْثْنَيْنِ اـِذْ هُمَا <br>\
                  فِى الغَارِ اـِذْ يَقُولُ لِصَاحِبِهِ لَا تَحزَنْ اـِنَّ اْللّٰهَ مَعَنَا [<i>If ye will not aid him, verily God aided him, when those who disbelieved expelled him, being the second of two, when they two were in the cave, when he was saying to his companion, Grieve not thou, for God is with us</i>]. (Mughnee.) But sometimes one half of the proposition is suppressed, as in اـِذْ ذَاكَ, [also written اـِذَّاكَ,] meaning اـِذْ ذَاكَ <br>\
                  كَذٰلِكَ [<i>When that was so</i>], or اـِذْ ذَاكَ كَايِنٌ [<i>When that was,</i> i. e. <i>then, at that time</i>]. (Mughnee.) And sometimes the whole of the proposition is suppressed, (M, Mughnee,) as being known, (Mughnee,) and tenween is substituted for it; the ذ receiving kesreh because of the occurrence of two quiescent letters together, (M, Mughnee,) namely the ذ and the tenween, (M,) and thus one says, يَوْمَيِذٍ; the kesreh of the ذ not being, as Akh holds it to be, the kesreh of declension, although اذ here occupies the place of a noun governed in the gen. case by another prefixed to it, (M, Mughnee,) for it still requires a proposition  to be understood after it, (Mughnee,) and is held to be indecl. (M, Mughnee) by general consent, like كَمْ and مَنْ, (M,) as being composed of two letters. (Mughnee.) [J says,] when اـِذْ is not prefixed to a proposition, it has tenween: (S:) and hence Aboo-Dhu-eyb says, (S, M,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        نَهَيْتُكَ عَنْ طِلَابِكَ اُمَّ عَمْرٍو<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        بِعَافِيَةٍ وَاَنْتَ اـِذٍ صَحِيحُ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>I forbade thy suing Umm-&#39;Amr in health, thou being then sound</i>]; (S, M, L, Mughnee, TA; [but in two copies of the S, for بِعَافِيَةٍ, I find بِعَاقِبَةٍ; and in the L it is without any point;]) in which [J says] the poet means حِينَيِذٍ, like as one says يَوْمَيذٍ and لَيْلَتَيِذٍ: (S:) and Fr says that some of the Arabs say, كَانَ كَذَا و كَذَا وَهُوَ اـِذٍ صَبِىٌّ, meaning هُوَ اـِذْ ذَاكَ صَبِىٌّ [<i>Such and such things were, he being then a boy</i>]. (T.) اـِذِى also occurs for اذ [app. اـِذٍ, but whether this or اـِذْ is not clear in the MS. from which I take this]. (M.) When اـِذٍ is adjoined to nouns signifying times, the Arabs join it therewith in writing, in certain instances: namely حِينَيِذٍ [<i>At that time,</i> or <i>then</i>], and يَوْمَيِذٍ [<i>In,</i> or <i>on,</i> or <i>at, that day</i>], and لَيْلَتَيِذٍ [<i>In,</i> or <i>on,</i> or <i>at, that night</i>], and غَدَاتَيِذٍ [<i>In,</i> or <i>on, that morning</i>], and عَشِيَّتَيِذٍ [<i>In,</i> or <i>on, that evening</i>], and سَاعَتَيِذٍ [<i>In that hour:</i> or <i>at that time; then</i>], and عَامَيِذٍ [<i>In that year</i>], [and وَقْتَيِذٍ <br>\
                  <i>At that time; then</i>]; but they did not say الا=نَيِذٍ, because الا=نَ denotes the nearest present time, except in the dial. of Hudheyl, in which it has been found to occur. (T.) When it is followed by a verb, or by a noun not having the article ال prefixed to it, or [rather] by any movent letter, the ذ of اـِذْ is quieseent; but when it is followed by a noun with ال, [or by any اْ,] the ذ is mejroorah, as in the saying, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        اـِذِ القَوْمُ كَانُوا نَازِلِينَ بِكَاظِمَهْ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>When the people,</i> or <i>company of men, were alighting,</i> or <i>taking up their abode, at Kádhimeh</i>]. (T.) ―         -b2-  In general, (Mughnee, K,) it is an adverbial noun denoting past time, (M, Mughnee, K,) when it is a noun denoting such time, (Mughnee, K,) as in وَ اـِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَايِكَةِ [explained above], (M,) and in فَقَدْ نَصَرَهُ اْللّٰهُ اـِذْ <br>\
                  اَخْرَجَهُ اْلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا [also explained above, and in other instances already mentioned]: (Mughnee, K:) in the former of which instances, AO says that it is redundant; (M, Mughnee;) but Aboo-Is-hák says that this is a bold assertion of his; (M;) [and IHsh says,] this assertion is of no account, and so is that of him who says that it here denotes certainty, like قَدْ: (Mughnee:) [J holds the opinion of AO on this point; for he says,] اـِذْ is sometimes redundant, like اـِذَا, as in the saying in the Kur [ii. 48], وَاـِذْ وَاعَدْنَا مُوسَى, meaning وَوَاعَدْنَا مُوسَى [<i>And We appointed a time with Moses;</i> but instances of this kind are most probably elliptical: see the next sentence]. (S.) As a noun denoting past time, it is [said to be] also an objective complement of a verb, as in [the Kur vii. 84,] وَاْذْكُرُوا اـِذْ كُنْتُمْ قَلِيلاً [<i>And remember ye when ye were few</i>]: (Mughnee, K:) and generally in the commencements of narratives in the Kur, it may be an objective complement of اُذْكُرْ understood, as in وَ اـِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَايِكَةِ [before cited], and the like. (Mughnee: but see the third of the sentences here following.) As such, it is [said to be] also a substitute for the objective complement of a verb, as in [the Kur xix. 16,] وَ اْذْكُرْ فِى اْلْكِتَابِ مَرْيَمَ اـِذِ اْنْتَبَذَتْ [<i>And mention thou,</i> or <i>remember thou, in the Scripture, Mary, the time when she withdrew aside</i>], where اذ is a substitute of implication for مريم. (Mughnee, K: but see the second of the sentences here following.) As such, it also has prefixed to it a noun of time, of such a kind that it is without need thereof, as in يَوْمَيِذٍ, or not of such a kind that it is without need thereof, as in [the Kur iii. 6,] بَعْدَ اـِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا [<i>After the time when Thou hast directed us aright</i>]. (Mughnee, K.) And it is generally asserted, that it never occurs otherwise than as an adverbial noun, or as having a noun prefixed to it; that in the like of وَاْذْكُرُوا اـِذْ كُنْتُمْ <br>\
                  قَلِيلاً, it is an adverbial noun relating to an objective complement suppressed, i. e. وَ اْذْكُرُوا نِعْمَةَ اْللّٰهِ <br>\
                  عَلَيْكُمْ اـِذْ كُنْتُمْ قَلِيلاً [<i>And remember ye the grace of God towards you when ye were few</i>]; and in the like of اـِذِ اْنْتَبَذَتْ, that it is an adverbial noun relating to a suppressed prefixed noun to [that which becomes by the suppression] the objective complement of a verb, i. e. [in this instance] وَ اْذْكُرْ قِصَّةَ مَرْيَمَ [<i>And mention thou,</i> or <i>remember thou, the case of Mary</i>]: and this assertion is strengthened by the express mention of the [proper] objective complement in [the Kur iii. 98,] وَ اْذْكُروا نِعْمَةَ اْللّٰهِ عَلَيْكُمْ اـِذْ كُنْتُمْ اَعْدَا=ءً [<i>And remember ye the grace of God towards you when ye were enemies</i>]. (Mughnee.) ―         -b3-  Also, (Mughnee, K,) accord. to some, (T, Mughnee,) it is used (T, Mughnee, K) as a noun (Mughnee, K) to indicate future time, (T, Mughnee, K,) and اـِذَا is said to denote past time, (T,) [i. e.] each of these occurs in the place of the other; (TA;) the former being used to indicate future time in the Kur [xxxiv. 50], where it is said, وَلَوْ تَرَى اـِذْ فَزِعُوا [<i>And couldst thou see the time when they shall be terrified</i>], meaning the day of resurrection; this usage being allowable, says Fr, only because the proposition is like one expressing a positive fact, since there is no doubt of the coming of that day; (T;) and in [the Kur xcix. 4,] يَوْمَيِذٍ تُحَدِّثُ اَخْبَارَهَا [<i>On that day, she</i> (the earth) <i>shall tell her tidings</i>]; (Mughnee, K;) this being generally regarded as similar to the expression of a future event which must necessarily happen as though it had already happened; but it may be urged in favour of those who hold a different opinion that it is said in the Kur [xl. 72 and 73], فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ اـِذِ الاَغلَالُ فِى <br>\
                  اَعْنَاقِهِمْ [<i>They shall hereafter know, when the collars</i> shall be <i>on their necks</i>]; for يعلمون is a future as to the letter and the meaning because of its having سوف conjoined with it, and it governs اذ, which is therefore in the place of اـِذَا. (Mughnee.) ―         -b4-  It also indicates a cause, as in [the Kur xliii. 38,] لَنْ يَنْفَعَكُمُ اْلْيَوْمَ اـِذْ ظَلَمْتُمْ [<i>It will not profit you this day, since,</i> or <i>because, ye have acted wrongfully</i>], (Mughnee, K,) i. e. because of your having acted wrongfully in the sublunary state of existence; (Bd, Mughnee;) but it is disputed whether it be in this instance a particle in the place of the causative ل, or an adverbial noun: (Mughnee:) Aboo-&#39;Alee seems to hold that اذ ظلمتم [as meaning <i>when ye have acted wrongfully</i>] is a substitute for, or a kind of repetition of, اليوم; an event happening in the present world being spoken of as though it happened in the world to come because the latter immediately follows the former. (IJ, M, L, Mughnee.) You say also, الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ اـِذْ جِيْتَ [<i>Praise be to God because,</i> or <i>that, thou camest,</i> or <i>hast come</i>]. (S in art. جيا.) ―         -b5-  It is also used to denote one&#39;s experiencing the occurrence of a thing when he is in a particular state; (S, L;) or to denote a thing&#39;s happening suddenly, or unexpectedly; (S, Mughnee, K;) like اـِذَا; (S;) and in this case is only followed by a verb expressing an event as a positive fact, (S, L,) and occurs after بَيْنَا and بَيْنَمَا; (Mughnee, K;) as [in exs. voce بَيْنَ; and] in بَيْنَمَا اَنَا كَذَا اـِذْ جَا=ءَ زَيْدٌ [<i>While I was thus,</i> or <i>in this state, lo,</i> or <i>behold,</i> or <i>there,</i> or <i>then, at that time,</i> (accord. to different authorities, as will be seen below,) <i>Zeyd came</i>]; (S, L;) and as in the saying of a poet, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        اِسْتَقْدِرِ اْللّٰهَ خَيْراً وَاْرْضَيَنَّ بِهِ<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        فَبَيْنَمَااْلْعُسْرُ اـِذ دَارَتْ مَيَاسِيرُ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>Beg thou God to appoint for thee good, and do thou be content therewith; for while</i> there has been <i>difficulty, lo, easy circumstances have come about</i>]: (Mughnee, K: *) but it is disputed whether it be [in this case] an adverbial noun of place, (Mughnee, K,) as Zj and AHei hold; (TA;) or of time, (Mughnee, K,) as Mbr holds; (TA;) or a particle denoting the sudden, or unexpected, occurrence of a thing, (Mughnee, K,) as IB and Ibn-Málik hold; (TA;) or a corroborative, i. e. [grammatically] redundant, particle, (Mughnee, K,) an opinion which Ibn-Ya&#39;eesh holds, and to which Er-Radee inclines. (TA.) ―         -b6-  It is also a conditional particle, but only used as such coupled with ما, (S, L, Mughnee, *) and causes two aorists to assume the mejzoom form, (Mughnee,) as when you say, اـِذْمَا تَاْتِنِى ا=تِكَ [<i>When,</i> or <i>whenever, thou shalt come to me, I will come to thee</i>], like as you say, اـِنْ تاْتِنِى وَقْتًا <br>\
                  ا=تِكَ [If thou come to me at some, or any, time, I will come to thee]; and you say also اـِذْمَا اَتَيْتَ [like as you say, اـِنْ اَتَيْتَ, using the pret. in the sense of the future]: (S, L:) it is a particle accord. to Sb, used in the manner of the conditional اـِنْ; but it is an adverbial noun accord. to Mbr and Ibn-Es-Sarráj and El-Fárisee. (Mughnee.) ―         -b7-  [What I have translated from the S, L, K, and TA, in this art., is mostly from فصل الهمزة of باب الذال : the rest, from باب الالف اللينّة.]   </entryFree> <br>\
