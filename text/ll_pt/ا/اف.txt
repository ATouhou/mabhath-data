      اَفَّهْ, the last mentioned by IB on the authority of IKtt.

(IAmb.) It is said in the Kur [xvii. 24], وَلَا تَقُلْ لَهُمَا اُفِّ, (T, S, TA,) or اُفٍّ, (TA, [in which other readings also are mentioned,]) [<i>And say not thou to them</i> (i. e. to thy father and mother) <i>Ugh,</i> &amp;amp;c.,] meaning, do not thou deem anything of their affairs burdensome, nor be contracted in bosom thereby, nor be rough, or harsh, or coarse, to them: (Kt, T:) or do not thou say to them anything expressive of the least disgust, when they have become old, but take upon thyself their service; اُفِّ signifying <i>stink.</i> (Zj, T.)    </entryFree> <br>\
