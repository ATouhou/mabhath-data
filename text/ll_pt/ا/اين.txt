                  </quote> [<i>We were,</i> or <i>have become, fatigued, by the Lord of the lean and lank-bellied youthful she-camels</i>]: but Lth says that there is no verb derived from اَيْنٌ, in this sense, except in poetry: (T:) Aboo-Mohammad says that the only instance is that cited above: (TA:) [it is not disputed that] اَيْنٌ signifies <i>fatigue,</i> or the <i>being fatigued</i> or <i>tired:</i> (S, K:) AZ says that it has no verb formed from it; but on this point he has been contradicted: (S:) A &#39;Obeyd also says that it has no verb. (M.)       -A2-  ا=نَ, aor. يَيِينُ, inf. n. اَيْنٌ, (S, M, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c., [but see what follows,]) also signifies <i>Its time came;</i> (اَتَى وَقْتُهُ;) as also اَنَى: (Bd lvii. 15:) <i>it was,</i> or <i>became, present: it came,</i> or <i>attained, to its time; to its full,</i> or <i>final, time,</i> or <i>state; to maturity: it was,</i> or <i>became,</i> or <i>drew, near:</i> syn. اَنَى: (M:) and اَدْرَكَ; like اَنَى: (Ham p. 455:) and حَانَ: (S, M, Msb, K:) and قَرُبَ. (Mughnee voce اـِنَّ.) You say, ا=نَ لَكَ اَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا, aor. and inf. n. as above, (AZ, S,) i. e. حَانَ [<i>The time has come,</i> or <i>has drawn near, for thee to do,</i> or <i>that thou shouldst do, such a thing</i>]; like اَنَى: and it is formed from it by transposition: (S:) [i. e.] اَنَى is formed by transposition from ا=نَ: (Msb:) or ا=نَ is a dial. var. of اَنَى; not formed from it by transposition, [nor is the reverse the case,] because of the existence of the inf. n. [of each]: (M:) or ا=نَ is formed by transposition from اَنَى, because the latter has an inf. n. and the former has not: so says As: for اَيْنٌ does not belong to this; its meaning being only اـِعْيَا=ءٌ and تَعَبٌ: or, accord. to AZ, ا=نَ has an inf. n., namely اَيْنٌ; and if the case be so, the two [verbs] are equal; neither being the original of the other: (IJ in the Khasáïs:) Suh, in the R, asserts that ا=نَ is formed by transposition from اَنَى: (TA:) the assertion of El-Bekree, that ا=نَ is originally with و [for its medial radical letter], and that it is of the class of وَلِىَ, aor. يَلِى, requires consideration, and involves what is contrary to rule. (MF.) You say also, ا=نَ اَيْنُكَ, (S, M, K,) and اـِينُكَ, (M, K,) and ا=نُكَ, (S, K,) i. e. حَانَ حِينُكَ [<i>Thy time,</i> or <i>season, came,</i> or <i>hath come:</i> or <i>drew near,</i> or <i>hath drawn near</i>].

                  : see اَيْنٌ. ―         -b2-  اْلْا=نَ is a noun denoting the present time; (S, M, Msb, K;) [signifying <i>At the present time; now;</i> for] it is an adverbial noun; (S, Msb, K;) one which, in a place where it is fitting to be used as such, may not be used otherwise; occurring in a determinate sense; (S, K;) the ال being inseparable from it; (IJ, M, Msb;) not prefixed to it for the purpose of rendering it determinate, because it has not that which participates in its meaning: (S, Msb, K:) as Ibn-Es-Sarráj says, there is not one ا=ن and another ا=ن: (Msb:) [accord. to ISd, who quotes a long disquisition by IJ on this word,] the ال which is expressed in this case is redundant, because the noun is determinate without it, but it is rendered so by another ال, which is understood, as in the case of اَمْسِ: so says IJ, following Aboo-&#39;Alee; and his is the correct opinion: (M:) Fr says that it is a particle, compounded with ال, which is inseparable from it; and that it is originally اَوَانَ [or اْلْاَوَانَ]: or that it may have originated from the phrase ا=نَ لَكَ اَنْ تَفْعَلَ [explained above], and is therefore mansoob, like قِيلَ and قَالَ when used as nouns: but Zj disallows its originating from ا=نَ; and says that the right opinion is that of Kh, that اْلْا=نَ is indecl. with fet-h for its termination, and that the ال is prefixed because the meaning is هٰذَا الوَقْت; and this is the opinion of Sb. (T.) You say, اَنَا اْلْا=نَ <br>\
                  اَفْعَلُ كَذَا [<i>I, at the present time,</i> or <i>now, do,</i> or <i>will do, thus,</i> or <i>such a thing</i>]. (M.) And كُنْتُ اْلْا=نَ عِنْدَهُ, meaning <i>I was, in this time, of which part is present and some portions have passed, with him,</i> or <i>in his presence.</i> (IJ, M.) And when you mean the kind of expression which is used in this saying, you say, اَلْا=نُ حَدُّ <br>\
                  الزَّمَانَيْنِ [<i>The term “ now ” is the limit of the two times;</i> namely the past and the future]; thus pronounced, marfooa: so says IJ: but in the Book of Sb we read, الا=نَ حَدُّ الزَّمَانَيْنِ, with nasb: and in like manner, in the same, الا=نَ ا=نُكَ [<i>Now is thy time</i>]; the former with nasb and the  latter with refa. (M.) You say also, هٰذَا اَوَانُ <br>\
                  اْلْا=نَ [<i>This is the present time</i>]: and مَا جِيْتُ اـِلَّا <br>\
                  اَوَانَ اْلْا=نَ, meaning <i>I came not save at the present time,</i> or <i>now:</i> with the last word mansoob in both instances. (ISh, T.) [And اـِلَى اْلْا=نَ and حَتَّى اْلْا=نَ <br>\
                  <i>To the present time</i> and <i>until the present time;</i> i. e. <i>hitherto.</i> And مِنَ اْلْا=نَ <br>\
                  <i>From the present time; henceforward.</i>] Sometimes the hemzeh [after the ل] is suppressed, and its vowel is transferred to the ل; so that you say الَانَ. (Bd ii. 66.) And sometimes also the ل is pronounced with fet-h and both the hemzehs are suppressed; so that you say لَانَ. (S, K.) And sometimes تَ is prefixed to it, like as it is to حِينَ; so that you say تَلَانَ, like as you say تَحِينَ. (El-Umawee, A &#39;Obeyd. [See art. تلن.])    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>Fatigue.</i> (S, K, &amp;amp;c.) [Whether it be a simple subst., or an inf. n., and, if the latter, whether it be an inf. n. of ا=نَ only in the former of the two senses assigned to that verb above, or in both these senses, is doubted: see 1, throughout.]       -A2-  <i>A time; a season;</i> syn. حِينٌ; (S, M, K;) as also ↓ <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                   is an adverbial noun, (Msb,) an interrogative respecting a place: (S, M, Msb, K:) [signifying <i>Where? in what place?</i>]: Zj says that it is an interrogative particle, like كَيْفَ: (T:) [ISd says,] it is a noun, because you say, مِنْ اَيْنَ [meaning <i>From what place? whence?</i>]: (M:) [and you say also, اـِلَى اَيْنَ <br>\
                  <i>To what place? whither?</i>]: it is always mansoob, unless you prefix the article to it, saying الاَيْنُ [which means <i>The place where</i>]: (Lth, T:) it is fem.; but may be made masc. (Lh, M.) You say, اَيْنَ زَيْدٌ <br>\
                  <i>Where,</i> or <i>in what place, is Zeyd?</i> (S, Msb.) And اَيْنَ بَيْتُكَ [<i>Where is thy house,</i> or <i>tent?</i>]. (M.) And اَيْنَ يُذْهَبُ بِكَ, which may mean <i>Where,</i> or <i>whither, wilt thou be taken away, and what will be done with thee and made to come to pass with thee,</i> if this be thine intellect? or, accord. to Mtr, it is a saying of the people of Baghdád, addressed to him whom they charge with foolish judgment or opinion, as meaning اَيْنَ يُذْهَبُ بِعَقْلِكَ [<i>Where,</i> or <i>whither, is thine intellect taken away?</i>]. (Har p. 574.) [And اَيْنَ هٰذَا مِنْ ذَاكَ and عَنْ ذَاكَ and وَ ذَاكَ <br>\
                  <i>What place does this hold in relation to that,</i> or <i>in comparison with that? what is this in relation to that,</i> or <i>in comparison with that? what has this to do with that? what has this in common with that?</i>] ―         -b2-  It also denotes a condition: when you say, اَيْنَ تَجْلِسْ اَجْلِسْ [<i>Where thou sittest, I will sit</i>], the sitting must be in one place: and مَا is added to it; so that you say, اَيْنَمَا تَقُمْ اَقُمْ [<i>Wherever thou standest, I will stand</i>]. (Msb.) ―         -b3-  It also occurs used as a proper name of a particular place: thus the poet Homeyd Ibn-Thowr speaks of his companions as being بِاَيْنَ وَ اَيْنَمَا [app. meaning <i>In certain places: where and wherever those places were,</i> there were my companions]: in which case it is divested of the meaning of an interrogative, and is imperfectly decl. because determinate and of the fem. gender. (M, L. [In one copy of the former, بِاَنَّى وَ اَيْنَمَا, which may mean the same; and voce اَىٌّ, q. v., بِاَىَّ وَ اَيْنَمَا.])    </entryFree> <br>\

      اـِيَّانَ, (T, S, M, K,) the latter of the dial. of Suleym, mentioned by Fr, (T, S,) and by Zj, (M,) is an interrogative respecting a time, (T, S, Msb,) but only respecting a time not come: (T:) signifying <i>When?</i> (S, M, Msb;) <i>at what time?</i> (Msb, K:) it is fem.; but may be made masc.: (Lh, M:) and it may be pronounced with imáleh, though not belonging to a class of words regularly subject to imáleh.
