(TA.) The ال is pronounced with the disjunctive hemzeh in using the vocative form of address [يَا اَللّٰهُ] because it is inseparably prefixed as an honourable distinction of this name; (S;) or because a pause upon the vocative particle is intended in honour of the name; (S in art. ليه;) and AAF says that it is also thus pronounced in a form of swearing; as in اَفَاَللّٰهِ لَتَفْعَلَنَّ [an elliptical phrase, as will be shown below, meaning <i>Then, by God, wilt thou indeed do</i> such a thing?]; though he denies its being thus pronounced because it is inseparable; regarding it as a substitute for the suppressed hemzeh of الاـِلَاهُ: (S in the present art.:) Sb mentions this pronunciation in يَا اَللّٰهُ; and Th mentions the pronunciation of يَا اللّٰهُ also, with the conjunctive hemzeh: Ks, moreover, mentions, as used by the Arabs, the phrase يَلَهْ اَغْفِرْلِى [<i>O God, forgive me</i>], for يَا اللّٰهُ; but this is disapproved. (ISd, TA.) The word is pronounced in the manner termed تَفْخِيم, [i. e., with the broad sound of the lengthened fet-h, and with a full sound of the letter ل,] for the purpose of showing honour to it; but when it is preceded by a kesreh, [as in بِاللّٰهِ <br>\
                  <i>By God,</i> and بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ <br>\
                  <i>In the name of God,</i>] it is pronounced in the [contr.] manner termed تَرْقِيق: AHát says that some of the vulgar say, لَاوَاللّٰهْ [<i>No, by God</i>], suppressing the alif, which should necessarily be uttered, as in الرَّحْمنُ, which is in like manner written without alif; and he adds that some person has composed a verse in which the alif [in this word] is suppressed, erroneously. (Msb.) You say, اَللّٰهَ اللّٰهَ فِى كَذَا, [a verb being understood,] meaning <i>Fear ye God, fear ye God, with respect to such a thing.</i> (Marginal note in a copy of the Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer. [See another ex. voce كَرَّةٌ.]) And اَللّٰهَ لَاَفْعَلَنَّ and اَللّٰهِ لَاَفْعَلَنَّ [<i>By God, I will assuredly do</i> such a thing]: in the former is understood a verb significant of swearing; and in the latter, [or in both, for a noun is often put in the accus. case because of a particle understood,] a particle [such as بِ or وَ] denoting an oath. (Bd in ii. 1.) And لِلهِ مَا فَعَلْتُ, meaning وَاللّٰهِ مَا فَعَلْتُ [<i>By God, I did not,</i> or <i>have not done,</i> such a thing]. (JK.) And لِلّهِ دَرُّكَ (tropical:)  <i>To God be attributed thy deed!</i> (A in art. در:) or <i>the good that hath proceeded from thee!</i> or <i>thy good deed!</i> or <i>thy gift!</i> and <i>what is received from thee!</i> [and <i>thy flow of eloquence!</i> and <i>the like</i>]: a phrase expressive of admiration of anything: (TA in art. در:) [when said to an eloquent speaker or poet, it may be rendered <i>divinely art thou gifted!</i>]. And لِلّهِ دَرُّهُ (tropical:)  <i>To God be attributed his deed!</i> [&amp;amp;c.]. (S and K in art. در.) And لِلّهِ القَايِلُ [meaning <i>To God be attributed</i> (<i>the eloquence of</i>) <i>the sayer!</i> or] <i>how good,</i> or <i>beautiful, is the saying of the sayer,</i> or <i>of him who says</i> [such and such words]! or it is like the phrase لِلّهِ دَرُّهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>To God be attributed his goodness!</i> and <i>his pure action!</i> (Har p. 11.) And لِلّهِ فُلَانٌ [<i>To God be attributed</i> (<i>the excel-lence,</i> or <i>goodness,</i> or <i>deed,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>of</i>) <i>such a one!</i>] explained by Az as meaning <i>wonder ye at such a one: how perfect is he!</i> (Har ibid.) [And لِلّهِ اَبُوكَ: see art. ابو.] And لَاهِ اَنْتَ, meaning لِلّهِ اَنْتَ [lit. <i>To God be thou attributed!</i> i. e. <i>to God be attributed thine excellence!</i> or <i>thy goodness!</i> or <i>thy deed!</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (JK.) [Similar to لِلّهِ, thus used, is the Hebrew expression        <br>\

                  رَاجِعُونَ, in the Kur [ii. 151], said on the occasion of an affliction, means <i>Verily to God we belong,</i> as property and servants, He doing with us what He willeth, <i>and verily unto Him we return</i> in the ultimate state of existence, and He will recompense us. (Jel.) AZ mentions the phrase الحَمْدُلَاهِ [meaning الحَمْدُلِلّهِ <br>\
                  <i>Praise be to God</i>]: but this is not allowable in the Kur-án: it is only related as heard from the Arabs of the desert, and those not knowing the usage of the Kur-án. (Az, TA.) ―         -b2-  ↓ <br>\
      اَللّهُمَّ is an expression used in prayer; as also لَاهُمَّ; (JK, Msb;) meaning يَا اَللّٰهُ [<i>O God</i>]; the م being a substitute for [the suppressed vocative particle] يا; (S in art. ليه, and Bd in iii. 25;) but one says also, يَا اَللّهُمَّ, (JK, and S ibid,) by poetic licence: (S ibid:) or the meaning, accord. to some, is يَا اَللّٰهُ اُمَّنَا بِخَيْرٍ [<i>O God, bring us good</i>]; (JK, and Bd ubi suprà;) and hence the origin of the expression. (Bd.) You say also اَللّهُمَّ اـِلَّا [which may be rendered, inversely, <i>Unless, indeed;</i> or <i>unless, possibly</i>]: the former word being thus used to denote that the exception is something very rare. (Mtr in the commencement of his Expos. of the Makámát of El-Hareeree, and Har pp. 52 and 53.) And اَللّهُمَّ نَعَمْ [which may be rendered, inversely, <i>Yes, indeed;</i> or <i>yea, verily</i>]: the former word being used in this case as corroborative of the answer to an interrogation, negative and affirmative.
