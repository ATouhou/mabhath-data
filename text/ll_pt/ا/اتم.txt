                   is primarily used in relation to the سِقا=ء [or skin for water or milk; as meaning] <i>Having two punctures of a seam</i> (خُرْزَتَانِ) <i>rent so that they become one.</i> (S.) ―         -b2-  And hence, (S,) or from اَتَمَ as meaning “he brought together, or united,” two things, (T,) A woman <i>whose</i> <br>\

                   is a quasi-inf. n. of اَتَمَ in the last of the senses explained above. (Msb.) [Thus it signifies <i>A staying, remaining, dwelling,</i> or <i>abiding,</i> in a place. But it more commonly signifies] The <i>assembling</i> of women [and of men also] <i>in a case of rejoicing</i> and <i>of mourning.</i> (Har p. 234.) ―         -b2-   It is also a noun of time from the same. (Msb.) [Thus it signifies <i>A time of staying</i> or <i>remaining,</i> &amp;amp;c.] ―         -b3-  And it is also a noun of place from the same. (Msb.) [And thus it signifies <i>A place of staying</i> or <i>remaining,</i> &amp;amp;c. But it more commonly signifies] <i>A place of assembling</i> of women [and of men also] <i>in a case of rejoicing</i> and <i>of mourning:</i> from اَتِمَ, aor.      <br>\

                  , accord. to Khálid Ibn-Yezeed. (T.) ―         -b4-  And hence, tropically, (Msb,) (tropical:)  <i>Women assembling together</i> (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) <i>in a case of rejoicing</i> and <i>of mourning,</i> (T, M, Mgh, K,) or <i>in a case of good</i> and <i>of evil:</i> (S, Msb:) or <i>any assembly,</i> (M, K,) <i>of men</i> and <i>of women,</i> (M,) <i>in a case of mourning</i> or <i>of rejoicing:</i> (M, K:) or particularly <i>of young women;</i> (M, K,) accord. to some; but it is not so: and some assert that the word is derived from اَتْمٌ, in the first of the senses explained in this art.; and from اَتُومٌ, as an epithet applied to a woman; because it signifies <i>women coming together, and meeting face to face, in a case of good</i> and <i>of evil:</i> (M:) the pl. is مَا=تِمُ. (S, Mgh.) Abu-l-&#39;Atà Es-Sindee says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>In the evening when arose the wailing women</i> to wail, <i>and openings at the necks and bosoms</i> of garments <i>were rent with the hands of assembled</i> mourning <i>women, and cheeks</i> also were lacerated]: (S, M, Mgh:) i. e., بِاَيْدِى نِسَا=ءٍ. (S.) And another says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>So that thou seest them</i> (referring to women) <i>standing in his presence,</i> or <i>at,</i> or <i>by, it, like as thou seest the assembly of men around the prince,</i> or <i>commander</i>]: الماتم here necessarily denoting men. (M.) ―         -b5-  IKt says, (Msb,) it is used by the vulgar to denote <i>An affliction,</i> or <i>evil accident;</i> (S, Mgh, Msb;) [and Mtr adds,] and <i>a wailing:</i> (Mgh:) they say, كُنَّا فِى مَاـْتَمِ فَلَانٍ [meaning <i>We were present at the affliction of</i> <br>\
                  <i>such a one</i>]: (S, Msb:) or كُنَّا فِى مَاْتَمِ بَنِي فُلَلنٍ [meaning, <i>We were present at the affliction,</i> and <i>wailing, of the sons of such a one</i>]: (Mgh:) but the correct word in this case, (S, Mgh,) or the better, (Msb,) is مَنَاحَة: (S, Mgh, Msb:) so says IAmb. (Mgh.) But accord. to IB, nothing forbids that it may occur in the sense of <i>A place of wailing;</i> and in the sense of <i>mourning,</i> and <i>wailing,</i> and <i>weeping;</i> for therefore do women assemble: and thus it may be in the saying of Et-Teymee, respecting Mansoor Ibn-Ziyád, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
