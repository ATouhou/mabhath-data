(A, L.) ثَالِثَةُ الاَثَافِىsignifies <i>The part, not detached, of a mountain; by the side of which, two pieces are put</i> [<i>for the cookingpot to be set thereon</i>]. (A&#39;Obeyd, T, K.) And hence the saying, (A&#39;Obeyd, T,) رَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ بثَالِثَةِ, الاَثَافِي(A&#39;Obeyd, T, K) <i>May God smite him with the mountain; meaning, with a calamity;</i> (Th, TA, K in art. ثفى;) <i>with a calamity like the mountain</i> [<i>in greatness</i>]; (Th, M;) for when they do not find the third of the اثافى, they rest the cooking-pot [partly] upon the <i>mountain:</i> (M, K, in art. ثفى:) or, <i>with difficulties,</i> or <i>troubles,</i> or <i>calamities:</i> (As, T:) or, <i>with all evil;</i> evils being likened to one اثفيّةafter another, and the third being the last: (T, K:) so says Aboo-Sa&#39;eed: (T:) or, <i>with the last of evil;</i> and <i>the last of everything hateful:</i> (AO in Har p. 84:) <i>or, with a great calamity.</i> (Har ib.) One says also, الاَثَافِى فُلَانٌ ثَالِثَةُ, meaning (tropical:)  <i>Such a one is the heaviest, most burdensome,</i> or <i>most troublesome, of the people.</i> (Har ubi suprà.) ―         -b2-  [Hence also,] الاَثَافِىis a name applied to (assumed tropical:)  <i>certain stars</i> [accord. to Ideler, as mentioned by Freytag in his Lex., <i>the stars</i> <br>\
