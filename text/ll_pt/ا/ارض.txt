                  فُلَانٍ [<i>How many are the lands of the sons of such a one!</i>]; (TA;) and another [and very common] pl. is [اَرَاضٍ, with the article written] الاَرَاضِى, contr. to rule, (S, Msb, K,) as though they had formed a pl. from ا=رُضٌ; (S;) thus written in all the copies of the S; [accord. to SM; but in one copy of the S, I find كَاَنَّهُمْ جَمَعُوا ااراضًا; and in another, ارضًا;] and in one copy [is added], “ thus it is found in his [J&#39;s] handwriting; ” but IB says that correctly he should have said اَرْضَى, like اَرْطَى; for as to ا=رُضٌ, its regular pl. would be اَوَارِضُ; and [SM says] I have found it observed in a marginal note to the S that the pl. of ا=رُضٌ would be اَا=رِضُ, like as اَكَالِبُ is pl. of اَكْلُبٌ; and wherefore did he not say that الاراضى is a pl. of an unused sing., like لَيَالٍ and اَهَالٍ, so that it is as though it were pl. of اَرْضَاةٌ, like as لَيَالٍ is pl. of لَيْلَاةٌ? yet if any one should propose the plea that it may be formed by transposition from اَا=رِضُ, he would not say what is improbable; its measure being in this case اَعَالِفُ; the word being اَرَاضِيُ, and the ء being changed into ى: (TA:) accord. to Abu-l-Khattáb, (S,) ا=رَاضٌ is also a pl. of اَرْضٌ, (S, K,) like as ا=هَالٌ is a pl. of اَهْلٌ; (S;) but IB says that, in the opinion of the critics, the truth with respect to what is related on the authority of Abu-l-Khattáb is, that from اَرْضٌ and اَهْلٌ are formed اَرَاضٍ and اَهَالٍ, as though they were pls. of اَرْضَاةٌ and اَهْلَاةٌ; like as they said لَيْلَةٌ and لَيَال, as though this were pl. of لَيْلَاةٌ. (TA.) It is said in proverbs, اَجْمَعُ مِنَ <br>\
                  الاَرْضِ [<i>More comprehensive than the earth</i>]: (TA:) and ا=مَنُ مِنَ الاَرْضِ [<i>More trustworthy than the earth,</i> in which treasures are securely buried]: and اَشَدُّ مِنَ الاَرْضِ [<i>Harder than the earth,</i> or <i>ground</i>]: (A, TA:) and اَذَلُّ مِنَ الاَرْضِ [<i>More vile,</i> or <i>more submissive, than the earth,</i> or <i>ground</i>].

                  لَهُ اَرْضَا (tropical:)  [<i>Whoso obeyeth me, I will be to him</i> as <i>ground</i> whereon one treads]; denoting submissiveness. (A, TA.) And فُلَانٌ اـِنٌ ضُرِبَ فَاَرْضٌ (tropical:)  [<i>Such one, if he be beaten, is</i> like <i>ground</i>]; i. e. he cares not for beating. (A, TA.) One says also, لَا اَرْضَ <br>\

You say بَعِيرٌ شَدِيدُ الاَرْضِ (tropical:)  <i>A camel strong in the legs.</i> (TA.)

I&#39;Ab is related to have said, on the occasion of an earthquake, اَزُلْزِلَتِ الاَرْضُ اَمْ بِى اَرْضٌ, (S,) i. e. [<i>Hath the earth been made to quake, or is there in me</i>] <i>a tremor?</i> or <i>a vertigo?</i> (TA.) [اَهْلُ الاَرْضِ signifies <i>A certain class of the jinn,</i> or <i>genii;</i> by whom human beings are believed to be possessed, and affected by an involuntary tremor; whence it seems that this appellation may perhaps be from اَرْضٌ as signifying “ a tremor. ” See مَاْرُوضٌ: and see خَبَلٌ, as explained in the S.] ―         -b2-  Also <i>Rheum;</i> syn. زُكَامٌ: (S, K:) in this sense masc.; or, accord. to Kr, fem., on the authority of Ibn-Ahmar.
