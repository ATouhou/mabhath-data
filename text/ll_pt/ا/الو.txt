                  <i>flagged,</i> or <i>was remiss;</i> syn. قَصَّرَ: (S, M, K; and Fr, IAar, T, Mgh, in explanation of the first of these verbs:) and <i>he was slow,</i> or <i>tardy:</i> (M, K; and AA, T, S, in explanation of the second verb:) or <i>he flagged,</i> or <i>was remiss,</i> or <i>languid, and weak.</i> (A Heyth and T in explanation of all of the above-mentioned verbs except the last.) You say, اَلَا فِى الاَمْرِ, (Mgh,) and ↓ <br>\
      ايتلى <br>\
                  فِيهِ, (S,) <i>He fell short,</i> &amp;amp;c., (قَصَّرَ,) <i>in the affair.</i> (S, Mgh.) In the saying, لَم يَاْلُ اَنْ يَعْدِلَ فِى ذلِكَ, i. e. <i>He did not fall short,</i> &amp;amp;c., (لَمْ يُقَصَّرْ,) <i>in acting equitably and equally in that,</i> <br>\
                  فِى is suppressed before ان: but in the phrase, لَمْ يَاْلُو <br>\
                  مِنَ العَدْلِ, as some relate it, [the meaning intended seems to be, <i>They did not hold back,</i> or the like, <i>from acting equitably;</i> for here] the verb is made to imply the meaning of another verb: and such is the case in the saying, لَا ا=لُوكَ نُصْحًا, meaning <i>I will not refuse to thee, nor partially</i> or <i>wholly deprive thee of, sincere, honest,</i> or <i>faithful, advice:</i> (Mgh:) or this last signifies <i>I will not flag,</i> or <i>be remiss, nor fall short, to thee in giving sincere, honest,</i> or <i>faithful,</i> <br>\
                  <i>advice.</i> (T, S. *) It is said in the Kur [iii. 114], لَا يَاـْلُونَكُمْ خَبَالًا, meaning <i>They will not fall short,</i> or <i>flag,</i> or <i>be remiss, in corrupting you.</i> (IAar, T.) And the same meaning is assigned to the verb in the saying اُولُو الْفَضْلِ مِنْكُمْ, ↓ <br>\
      وَلَا يَاْتَلِ, in the Kur [xxiv. 22], by A&#39;Obeyd: but the preferable rendering in this case is that of A Heyth, which will be found below: see 4. (T.) Ks mentions the phrase, اَقْبَلَ بِضَرْبَةٍ لَا يَاْلُ [<i>He came with a blow, not falling short,</i> &amp;amp;c.], for لا يَاْلُو; like لَا اَدْرِ [for لا اَدْرِى]. (S, M: [but in the copies of the former in my hands, for بِضَرْبَةٍ, I find يَضْرِبُهُ.]) ↓ <br>\
      اَلَّى [with teshdeed] is also said of a dog, and of a hawk, meaning <i>He fell short of attaining the game that he pursued.</i> (TA.) And of a cake of bread, meaning <i>It was slow in becoming thoroughly baked.</i> (IAar, IB.) [See also the phrase لَا دَريْتَ وَلَا ايْتَليْتَ in a later part of this paragraph.] ―         -b2-  You say also, مَا اَلَوْتُ <br>\

And فُلَانٌ لَا يَاْلُو خَيْرًا <br>\
                  <i>Such a one does not leave, quit,</i> or <i>cease from, doing good.</i> (M.) And مَا اَلَوْتُ جَهْدًا <br>\
                  <i>I did not leave, omit,</i> or <i>neglect, labour, exertion, effort,</i> or <i>endeavour:</i> and the vulgar say, مَا ا=لُوكَ جَهْدًا; but this is wrong: so says As. (T. [See, however, similar phrases mentioned above.])       -A2-  اَلَا, aor. as above, (TA,) inf. n. اَلْوٌ, (IAar, T, TA,) also signifies <i>He strove,</i> or <i>laboured; he exerted himself,</i> or <i>his power</i> or <i>ability;</i> (IAar, T, TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
      تَاَلَّى: (T, TA:) the contr. of a signification before mentioned; i. e. “he flagged;,” or “was remiss, or languid, and weak.” (TA.) You say, اَتَانِى فِى حَاجَةٍ فَاَلَوْتُ فِيهَا <br>\
                  <i>He came to me respecting a want, and I strove,</i> or <i>laboured,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>to accomplish it.</i> (T.) ―         -b2-  And اَلَاهُ, aor. as above, (T, S,) inf. n. اَلْوٌ, (IAar, T, S,) <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, able to do it:</i> (IAar, T, S:) and ↓ <br>\
      الّى, inf. n. تَاْلِيَةٌ, also signifies <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, able;</i> (TA;) and so ↓ <br>\

                  <i>Such a one came to me respecting a want, and I was not able to rebuff him.</i> (T.) It is said in a trad., مَنْ صَامَ ↓ <br>\
      الدَّهْرَ فَلَا صَامَ وَلَا اَلَّى [<i>He who fasts ever,</i> or <i>always, may he neither fast</i>] <i>nor be able</i> to fast: as though it were an imprecation: or it may be enunciative: another reading is وَلَا ا=لَ, explained as meaning وَلَا رَجَعَ: [See art. اول:] but El-Khattábee says that it is correctly اَلَّى and اَلَا. (TA.) And the Arabs used to say, (S, M,) [and] accord. to a trad. it will be said to the hypocrite [in his grave], on his being asked respecting Mohammad and what he brought, and answering “I know not,” (T in art. تلو,) ↓ <br>\
      لَا دَرَيْتَ وَلَا ايتَلَيْتَ, (T, S, M, K,) meaning, accord. to As, (T,) or ISk, (S,) <i>Mayest thou not know, nor be able</i> to know: (T, S: *) or, accord. to Fr, <i>nor fall short,</i> or <i>flag,</i> in seeking to know; that the case may be the more miserable to thee: (T:) or وَلَا اَلَيْتَ, as an imitative sequent [for ولا اَلَوْتَ, to which the same explanations are applicable]: (MK:) or لَا دَرَيْتَ وَلَا تَلَيْتَ, the latter verb being assimilated to the former, (ISk, T in art. تلو, S,) said to mean وَلَا تَلَوْتَ, i. e. <i>nor mayest thou read nor study:</i> (T in art.    </entryFree> <br>\

      وَلَا يَاْتَلِ <br>\
                  اْلْفَضْلِ مِنْكُمْ, meaning, accord. to A Heyth and Fr, <i>And let not those of you who possess superabundance swear</i> [that they will not give to relations &amp;amp;c.]; for Aboo-Bekr [is particularly alluded to thereby, because he] had sworn that he would not expend upon Mistah and his relations who had made mention of [the scandal respecting] &#39;Áïsheh: and some of the people of El-Medeeneh read ↓ <br>\
      وَلَا يَتَاَلَّ, but this disagrees with the written text: A&#39;Obeyd explains it differently: see 1: but the preferable meaning is that here given. (T.) And it is said in a trad., ا=لَي مِنْ نِسَايِهِ شَهْرًا <br>\
                  <i>He swore that he would not go in to his wives for a month:</i> the verb being here made trans. by means of من because it implies the meaning of اِمْتِنَاع, which is thus trans. (TA.) [See also an ex. of the verb thus used in the Kur ii. 226.] عَلَى اللّٰهِ ↓ <br>\
      التَّاَلِّى is said to mean One&#39;s <i>saying, By God, such a one will assuredly enter the fire</i> [<i>of Hell</i>], <i>and God will assuredly make to have a good issue the work of such a one:</i> but see the act. part. n. below.

                  , accord. to Sb, is originally with و in the place of the [ى, i. e. the final] alif; and so is عَلَى; for the alifs [in these two particles] are not susceptible of imáleh; [i. e., they may not be pronounced ilè and &#39;alè;] and if either be used as the proper name of a man, the dual [of the former] is اـِلَوَانِ and [that of the latter] عَلَوَانِ; but when a pronoun is affixed to it, the alif is changed into yé, so that you say اـِلَيْكَ and عَلَيْكَ; though some of the Arabs leave it as it was, saying اـِلَاكَ and عَلَاكَ. (S.) It is a prep., or particle governing a noun in the gen. case, (S, Mughnee, K,) and denotes the end, as opposed to [مِنْ, which denotes] the beginning, of an extent, or of the space between two points or limits; (S, M;) or the end of an extent (T, Mughnee, K) of place; [signifying <i>To,</i> or <i>as far as;</i>] as in the phrase [in the Kur xvii. 1], مِنَ المَسْجِدِ الحَرَامِ اـِلَى المَسْجِدِ الاَقْصَى [<i>From the Sacred Mosque to,</i> or <i>as far as, the Furthest Mosque;</i> meaning from the mosque of Mekkeh to that of Jerusalem]; (Mughnee, K;) or in the saying, خَرَجْتُ مِنَ الكُوفَةِ اـِلَى مَكَّةَ [<i>I went forth from El-Koofeh to Mekkeh</i>], which may mean that you entered it, [namely, the latter place,] or that you reached it without entering it, for the end includes the beginning of the limit and the furthest part thereof, but does not extend beyond it. (S.) [In some respects it agrees with حَتَّى, q. v. And sometimes it signifies <i>Towards;</i> as in نَظَرَ اـِلَىَّ <br>\
                  <i>He looked towards me;</i> and مَالَ اـِلَيْهِ <br>\
                  <i>He,</i> or <i>it, inclined towards him,</i> or <i>it.</i> ―         -b2-  It also denotes the end of a space of time; [signifying <i>To, till,</i> or <i>until;</i>] as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 183], ثُمَّ اَتِمُّوا الصِّيَامَ اـِلَى اللَّيْلِ [<i>Then complets ye the fasting to,</i> or <i>till,</i> or <i>until, the night</i>]. (Mughnee, K.) [Hence, اـِلَى اَنْ (followed by a mansoob aor.) <i>Till,</i> or <i>until:</i> and اـِلَى مَتَى <br>\
                  <i>Till,</i> or <i>until, what time,</i> or <i>when?</i> i. e. <i>how long?</i> and also <i>to, till,</i> or <i>until, the time when.</i> See also the last sentence in this paragraph.] ―         -b3-  [In like manner it is used in the phrases اـِلَى غَيْرِ ذلِكَ, and اـِلَى ا=خِرِهِ, meaning, (<i>And so on,</i>) <i>to other things,</i> and <i>to the end thereof;</i> equivalent to <i>et cœtera.</i>] ―         -b4-  Sometimes, (S,) it occurs in the sense of مَعَ, (T, S, M, Mughnee, K,) when a thing is joined to another thing; (Mughnee, K;) as in the phrase [in the Kur iii. 45 and lxi. 14], مَنْ اَنْصَارِى اـِلَى اللّٰهِ [<i>Who will be my aiders with,</i> or <i>in addition to, God?</i>], (S, Mughnee, K,) accord. to the Koofees and some of the Basrees; (Mughnee;) i. e. <i>who will be joined to God in aiding me?</i> (M, TA;) and as in the saying [in the Kur iv. 2], وَلَا تَاْكُلُوا <br>\
                  اَمْوَالَهُمْ اـِلَى اَمْوَالِكُمْ [<i>And devour not ye their possessions with,</i> or <i>in addition to, your possessions</i>]; (T, S;) and [in the same, ii. 13,] وَاـِذَا خَلَوْا اـِلَى <br>\
                  شَيَا طِينِهِمْ [<i>And when they are alone with their devils</i>]; (S;) and in the saying, الذَّوْدُ اـِلَى الذَّوْدِ اـِبِلٌ [<i>A few she-camels with,</i> or <i>added to, a few she-camels are a herd of camels</i>], (S, Mughnee, K,) a prov., meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>a little with a little makes much;</i> (S and A in art. ذود, q. v.;) though one may not say, اـِلَى زَيْدٍ مَالٌ meaning مَعَ زَيْدٍ مَالٌ: (Mughnee:) so too in the saying, فُلَانٌ حَلِيمٌ اـِلَى اَدَبٍ وَفِقْهٍ [<i>Such a one is clement,</i> or <i>forbearing, with good education,</i> or <i>polite accomplishments, and intelligence,</i> or <i>knowledge of the law</i>]; (M, TA;) and so, accord. to Kh, in the phrase, اَحْمَدُ اللّٰهَ اـِلَيْكَ [<i>I praise God with thee:</i> but see another rendering of this phrase below]. (ISh.) In the saying in the Kur [v. 8], فَاغْسِلُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ وَاَيْدِيَكُمْ <br>\
                  اـِلَى المَرَافِقِ, it is disputed whether [the meaning be <i>Then wash ye your faces, and your arms with the elbows,</i> or, <i>and your arms as far as the elbows;</i> i. e., whether] the elbows be meant to be included among the parts to be washed, or excluded therefrom. (T.) A context sometimes shows that what follows it is included in what precedes it; as in قَرَاْتُ القُرْا=نَ مِنْ اَوَّلِهِ اـِلَى ا=خِرِهِ [<i>I read,</i> or <i>recited, the Kurán, from the beginning thereof to the end thereof</i>]: or that it is excluded; as in ثُمَّ اَتِمُّوا الصِّيَامَ اـِلَى اللَّيْلِ [explained above]: when this is not the case, some say that it is included if it be of the same kind [as that which precedes]; some, that it is included absolutely; and some, that it is excluded absolutely; and this is the right assertion; for with the context it is in most instances excluded. (Mughnee.) ―         -b5-  It is also used to show the grammatical agency of the noun governed by it, after a verb of wonder; or after a noun of excess importing love or hatred; [as in مَا اَحَبَّهُ اـِلَىَّ <br>\
                  <i>How lovely,</i> or <i>pleasing, is he to me!</i> (TA in art. حب,) and مَا اَبْغَضَهُ اـِلَىَّ <br>\
                  <i>How hateful,</i> or <i>odious, is he to me!</i> (S in art. بغض;) and] as in the saying [in the Kur xii. 33], رَبِّ <br>\
                  السِّجْنُ اَحَبُّ اـِلَىَّ [<i>O my Lord, the prison is more pleasing to me</i>]. (Mughnee, K.) [This usage is similar to that explained in the next sentence.] ―         -b6-  It is <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  عِنْدَ; (S, M, Mughnee, Msb, K;) as in the phrase, هُوَ اَشْهَى اـِلَىَّ مِنْ كَذَا [<i>It is more desirable,</i> or <i>pleasant, in my estimation than such a thing</i>]; (Msb;) and in the saying of the poet, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>Is there no way </i> of return <i>to youth, seeing that the remembrance thereof is more pleasant to me,</i> or <i>in my estimation, than mellow wine?</i>] (Mughnee, K:) and accord. to this usage of اـِلَى in the sense of عِنْدَ may be explained the saying, اَنْتِ <br>\
                  طَالِقٌ اـِلَى سَنَةٍ, meaning <i>Thou art divorced at</i> the commencement of <i>a year.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b7-  It is also <i>syn.</i> with لِ; as in the phrase, وَالاَمْرُ اـِلَيْكَ [<i>And command,</i> or <i>to command, belongeth unto Thee,</i> meaning God, as in the Kur xiii. 30, and xxx. 3], (Mughnee, K,) in a trad. respecting supplication: (TA:) or, as some say, it is here used in the manner first explained above, meaning, <i>is ultimately referrible to Thee:</i> and they say, اَحْمَدُ <br>\
                  اللّٰهَ اـِلَيْكَ, meaning, <i>I tell the praise of God unto thee:</i> (Mughnee:) [but see another rendering of this last phrase above:] you say also, ذَاكَ اـِلَيْكَ <br>\
                  <i>That is committed to thee,</i> or <i>to thy arbitration.</i> (Har p. 329.) ―         -b8-  It also occurs as <i>syn. with</i> <br>\

                  بَنِى اـِسْرَايِيلَ [<i>And we decreed against the children of Israel</i>]: (Msb:) or this means <i>and we revealed to the children of Israel</i> (Bd, Jel) <i>decisively.</i> (Bd.) ―         -b9-  It is also syn. with فِى; (M, Mughnee, K;) as in the saying [in the Kur iv. 89 and vi.12], لَيَجْمَعَنَّكُمْ اـِلَى يَوْمِ القِيَامَةِ [<i>He will assuredly collect you together on the day of resurrection</i>]: (K:) thus it may be used in this instance accord. to Ibn-Málik: (Mughnee:) and it is said to be so used in the saying [of En-Nábighah, (M, TA,)] <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>Then do not thou leave me with threatening, as though I were, among men, smeared with tar,</i> being like a <i>mangy</i> camel]; (M, Mughnee;) or, accord. to some, there is an ellipsis and inversion in this verse; الى being here in dependence upon a word suppressed, and the meaning being, <i>smeared with pitch,</i> [like a camel,] <i>yet being united to men:</i> or, accord. to Ibn-&#39;Osfoor, مطلىّ is here considered as made to import the meaning of <i>rendered hateful,</i> or <i>odious;</i> for he says that if الى were correctly used in the sense of فى, it it would be allowable to say, زَيْدٌاـِلَى الكُوفَةِ: (Mughnee:) [or the meaning may be, <i>as though I were, compared to men, a mangy</i> camel, <i>smeared with pitch:</i> for] I&#39;Ab said, after mentioning &#39;Alee, عِلْمِى اـِلَى عِلْمِهِ كَالقَرَارَةِ فِى المُثُعَنْجَرِ, meaning <i>My knowledge compared to his knowledge is like the</i> <br>\
                  قرارة [or <i>small pool of water left by a torrent</i>] <i>placed by the side of the middle of the sea</i> [or <i>the main deep</i>]. (K in art. ثعجر.) It is also [said to be] used in the sense of فى in the saying in the Kur [1xxix. 18], هَلْ لَكَ اـِلَى اَنْ تَزَكَّى [<i>Wilt thou purify thyself</i> from infidelity?] because it imports the meaning of invitation. (TA.) ―         -b10-  It is also used [in a manner contr. to its primitive application, i. e.,] to denote beginning, [or origination,] being <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  مِنْ; as in the saying [of a poet], <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

(Mughnee, K.) ―         -b11-  It is also used as a corroborative, and is thus [syntactically] redundant; as in the saying in the Kur [xiv. 40], فَاجْعَلْ اَفْيِدَةً مِنَ النَّاسِ تَهْوَى اـِلَيْهِمْ, with fet-h to the و [in تهوى], (Mughnee, K,) accord.  to one reading, (Mughnee,) meaning تَهْوَاهُمْ [i. e. <i>And make Thou hearts of men to love them</i>]: (K:) so says Fr: but some explain it by saying that تهوى imports the meaning of تَمِيلُ; or that it is originally تَهْوِى, with kesr, the kesreh being changed to a fet-hah, and the yé to an alif, as when one says رَضَا for رَضِىَ, and نَاصَاةٌ for نَاصِيَةٌ: so says Ibn-Málik; but this requires consideration; for it is a condition in such cases that the ى in the original form must be movent. (Mughnee.) [See art. هوى.] ―         -b12-  اَللّٰهُمَّ اـِلَيْكَ, occurring in a trad., [is elliptical, and] means <i>O God, I complain unto Thee:</i> or <i>take Thou me unto Thee.</i> (TA.) ―         -b13-  And اَنَا مِنْكَ وَاـِلَيْكَ means <i>I am of thee, and related to thee.</i> (TA.) ―         -b14-  You say also, اِذْهَبْ اـِلَيْكَ, meaning <i>Betake,</i> or <i>apply, thyself to,</i> or <i>occupy thyself with, thine own affairs.</i> (T, K. *) And similar to this is the phrase used by El-Aashà, فَاذْهَبِى مَا اـِلَيْكِ. (TA.) And اـِلَيْكُمْ [alone is used in a similar manner, elliptically, or as an imperative verbal noun, and] means <i>Betake,</i> or <i>apply, yourselves to,</i> or <i>occupy yourselves with, your own affairs,</i> (اِذْهَبُوا اـِلَيْكُمْ,) <i>and retire ye,</i> or <i>withdraw ye, to a distance,</i> or <i>far away, from us.</i> (ISk.) And اـِلَيْكَ عَنِّى means <i>Hold,</i> or <i>refrain, thou from me:</i> (T, K:) or <i>remove, withdraw,</i> or <i>retire, thou to a distance from me:</i> <br>\
                  اليك used in this sense is an imperative verbal noun. (Har p. 508.) Sb says, (M,) or Akh, (Har ubi suprà,) I heard an Arab of the desert, on its being said to him اـِلَيْكَ, reply, اـِلَىَّ; as though it were said to him <i>Remove, withdraw,</i> or <i>retire, thou to a distance,</i> and he replied, <i>I will remove,</i> &amp;amp;c.

                  </quote> [<i>When thou shalt demand water, she will say, Retire thou to a distance</i>]; meaning, [by ليكا, i. e. لَيْكَ with an adjunct alif for the sake of the rhyme,] اـِلَيْكَ, in the sense last explained above. (M.) ―         -b15-  One also says, اـِلَيْكَ كَذَا, meaning, <i>Take thou such a thing.</i> (T, K.) ―         -b16-  When اـِلَى is immediately followed by the interrogative مَا, both together are written اـِلَامَ [meaning, <i>To what? whither?</i> and <i>till,</i> or <i>until, what time,</i> or <i>when?</i> i. e. <i>how long?</i>]; and in like manner one writes عَلَامَ for عَلَى مَا, (S * and K voce ما,) and حَتَّامَ for حَتَّى.
