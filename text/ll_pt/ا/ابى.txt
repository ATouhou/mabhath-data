                  , aor. يَاْبَى, (S, M, Msb, K,) which is anomalous, (S, M, Msb,) because it has no faucial letter (S, Msb) for its second or third radical, (Msb,) and يَاْبِى, (M, Msb, K,) mentioned by IJ as sometimes said, (M,) agreeably with analogy, (TA,) and يِيْبَى, which is doubly anomalous, first because the pret. is of the measure فَعَلَ, and this pronunciation of the ى of the aor. is [regularly allowable only] in the case of a verb of the measure فَعِلَ, aor. يَفْعَلُ, and secondly because it is only in an aor. like يِيْجَلُ, (Sb, M,) i. e., of a verb of which the first radical letter is و or ى, (TA in art. وجل,) and يِيْبِى, (IB, [who cites as an ex. a verse ending with the phrase حَتَّى تِيْبِيَهْ,]) inf. n. اـِبَا=ءٌ (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and اـِبَا=ءَ ةٌ, (K,) or اـِبَاةٌ, (so in a copy of the M,) or اـِبَايَةٌ, (so in the Msb,) <i>He refused;</i> or <i>refrained, forbore, abstained,</i> or <i>held back;</i> syn. اِمْتَنَعَ; (S, Msb, MF, Bd in ii. 32, Kull p. 8,) <i>voluntarily,</i> or <i>of his own free will</i> or <i>choice:</i> (Bd ubi suprà, Kull:) [thus when used intransitively: and it is also used transitively:] you say, اَبَى الاَمْرَ <br>\
                  <i>he refused assent,</i> or <i>consent, to the thing,</i> or <i>affair; disagreed to it;</i> and <i>did not desire</i> [<i>to do</i>] <i>it:</i> (Mtr in Har p. 483:) <i>he did not assent to, consent to, approve,</i> or <i>choose, it; he disallowed it; rejected it:</i> (Mgh:) and اَبَي الشَّىْ ءَ <br>\
                  <i>he disliked, was displeased with, disapproved of,</i> or <i>hated, the thing.</i> (M, K.) Fr says that there is no verb with fet-h to its medial radical letter in the pret. and fut. [or aor.] unless its second or third radical is a faucial letter, except اَبَى: that AA adds رَكَنَ: but that one says رَكَنَ with يَرْكُنُ for its fut., and رَكِنَ with يَرْكَنُ for its fut.: (T:) so that the instance mentioned by AA is one of an intermixture of two dial. vars.: (TA:) Th adds قَلَى and غَسَا and شَجَا; and Mbr adds جَبَا: but most of the Arabs say يَقْلِى and يَغْسُو and يَشْجُو and يَجْبِى. (T.) [Some other instances are mentioned by other authors; but these are verbs of which the aors. are rarely with fet-h, or are instances of the intermixture of two dial. vars.] اَبَيْتَ اللَّعْنَ is a greeting which was addressed to kings in the time of ignorance; meaning <i>Mayest thou refuse,</i> or <i>dislike,</i> (ISk, * S, * M, * Har p. 491,) to do a thing that would occasion thy <i>being cursed!</i> (ISk, S, M;) or, to do that for which thou wouldst deserve <i>the being cursed!</i> for it implies the meaning of a prayer; i. e., may God make thee to be of those who dislike the being cursed! and hence it occurs parenthetically. (Har ubi suprà.) You say also, اَبَى اَنْ يُضَامَ [<i>He refused,</i> or <i>did not submit, to be harmed,</i> or <i>injured</i>]. (T.) [And sometimes لَا is inserted after اَنْ, and is either redundant, or corroborative of the meaning of the verb, as in the case of اَنَ لَا or اَلَّا after مَنَعَ.] It is said in the Kur ix. 32, وَيَاْبَى اللّهُ اـِلَّا اَنْ يُتِمَّ نَورَهُ, meaning <i>But God will not consent</i> or <i>choose</i> [<i>save to complete,</i> or <i>perfect, his light</i>]. (Bd.) And in the same xvii. 91, فَاَبَي اَكْثَرُ النَاسَ اـِلَّا كُفُورًا, i. e. [<i>But the greater number of men have not consented to,</i> or <i>chosen,</i> aught] <i>save denying</i> [its truth, or <i>disbelieving</i> it]; this phrase with اـِلَّا being allowable because it is rendered by means of a negative. (Bd.) You also say, كَانَ يَاْبَى اللَّحْمَ [<i>He used to refuse,</i> or <i>dislike, flesh-meat</i>], (K,) or اَكْلَ اللَّحْمِ [<i>the eating of flesh-meat</i>]. (Mgh.) And اَبَى فَلَانٌ المَا=ءِ [<i>Such a one refused,</i> or <i>disliked, water,</i> or <i>the water</i>]: (S:) or اَبَى مِنْ شُرْبِ <br>\
                  المَا=ءِ [<i>he refused,</i> or <i>voluntarily refrained from, the drinking of water,</i> or <i>the water</i>]. (AAF, M.) And اَبَى عَلَيْهِ الاَمَرَ, (Mgh, and Mtr. [author of the Mgh] in Har p. 483,) and عَلَيْهِ ↓ <br>\
      تَاَبَّاهُ, both signify <i>He refused him his assent,</i> or <i>consent, to the thing,</i> or <i>affair.</i> (Mtr ubi suprà, in Har.) Hence, (Mtr ubi suprà,) اَبَى عَلَيْهِ, (Mgh, and Mtr ubi suprà,) and عَلَيْهِ ↓ <br>\
      تَاَبَّى, (T, S, and Mtr ubi suprà,) <i>He was incompliant,</i> or <i>unyielding, to him; he resisted him, withstood him,</i> or <i>repugned him;</i> syn. اِمْتَنَعَ (T, S, Mgh, and Mtr ubi suprà) عَلَيْهِ: (T:) thus explained because the objective complement (الاَمْرَ) is suppressed. (Mtr ubi suprà.)       -A2-  اَبِيْتُ الطَّعَامَ, (K,) or مِنَ الطَّعَامِ, and اللَّبَنِ, (M, TA, [in a copy of the former of which the verb is written ابَيْتُ, but this I suppose to be a mistranscription, on account of what here follows,]) like رَضِيْتُ, (K,) inf. n. اَبَّى, (M, and so in some copies of the K,) or اـِبَّى, (so in some copies of the K,) with kesr, and with the short final alif, (TA, [i.e. like رِضَّى, but perhaps this may have been supposed to be the right reading only because the verb is likened to رَضِيتُ, of which رِضَّى is the most common inf. n.,]) <i>I left,</i> or <i>relinquished, the food,</i> (M, K,) and <i>the milk,</i> (M, TA,) <i>without being satiated,</i> or <i>satisfied.</i> (M, K.) ―         -b2-  اَبِىَ الفَصِيلُ, and اُبِىَ, inf. n. اَبَّى, <i>The young camel,</i> or <i>young weaned camel, suffered indigestion from the milk, and became affected with a dislike of food.</i> (M, K.)       -A3-  اَبَيْتُ as <i>syn. with</i> <br>\

                   [in the CK, erroneously, اَبَيْتُهُ] <i>I made him to refuse it;</i> or <i>to refrain, forbear, abstain,</i> or <i>hold back, from it, voluntarily,</i> or <i>of his own free will</i> or <i>choice:</i> (S: [this meaning being there implied, though not expressed:]) or <i>I made him to dislike it, to be displeased with it, to disapprove of it,</i> or <i>to hate it:</i> (M, K:) namely, water [&amp;amp;c.]. (S, M.) One says, فُلَانٌ بَحْرٌ لَا بُوْبِى, (ISk, S, K, * [in the CK, erroneously, لا يُوْبى,]) i. e., لَا يَجْعَلُكَ تَاْبَاهُ [<i>Such a one is</i> like <i>a sea,</i> or <i>great river, that will not make thee to refuse it,</i> or <i>dislike it,</i> &amp;amp;c.]; (K;) i. e., <i>that will not fail,</i> or <i>come to an end,</i> (ISk, S, K,) <i>by reason of its abundance.</i> (ISk, S.) In like manner one says, of any water, مَا=ءٌ لَا يُوْبِى [<i>Water that will not fail,</i> or <i>come to an end</i>]. (TA.) And عِنْدَنَا مَا=ءٌ مَا <br>\
                  يُوْبِى <br>\
                  <i>With us,</i> or <i>at our abode, is water that does not become scanty,</i> or <i>little in quantity.</i> (Lh, T, M.) And ا=بَى المَا=ءُ <br>\
                  <i>The water decreased,</i> or <i>became deficient.</i> (AA, from El-Mufaddal.) And قَلِيبٌ لَا يُوْبِى <br>\
                  <i>A well that will not become exhausted:</i> (IAar, M:) one should not say, يُوْبَى. (M, TA.) In like manner, also, one says, كَلَاَ <br>\
                  لَا يُوْبَى <br>\
                  <i>Herbage,</i> or <i>pasture, that will not fail,</i> or <i>come to an end.</i> (S.) And عِنْدَهُ دَرَاهِمُ لَا تُوْبِى <br>\
                  <i>He has dirhems,</i> or <i>money, that will not fail,</i> or <i>come to an end.</i> (TA.) And ا=بَى المَا=ءُ signifies also <i>The water</i> [in a well] <i>was,</i> or <i>became, difficult of access</i> (اِمْتَنَعَ), <i>so that no one was able to descend to it but by exposing himself to peril</i> or <i>destruction:</i> (M:) if a drawer of water descend into the well, (T, TA,) and the water be altered for the worse in odour, (TA,) he expose himself to peril, or destruction.
