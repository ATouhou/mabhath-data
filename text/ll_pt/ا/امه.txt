                  , inf. n. اَمَهٌ, <i>He forgot.</i> (S, K.) Hence the reading of I&#39;Ab, [in the Kur xii. 45,] وَادَّكَرَ بَعْدَ اَمَهٍ [<i>And he remembered,</i> or <i>became reminded, after forgetting</i>]. (S.) AHeyth is said to have read بَعْدَ اَمْهٍ; and accord. to AO, اَمْهٌ signifies نِسْيَانٌ [like اَمَهٌ]; but this is not correct. (Az, TA.) ―         -b2-  <i>He confessed,</i> or <i>acknowledged:</i> (S, K:) occurring in this sense in a trad. of Ez-Zuhree; but not well known. (S.) The reading of I&#39;Ab, mentioned above, بَعْدَ اَمَهٍ, is explained by A&#39;Obeyd as meaning <i>after confessing,</i> or <i>acknowledging.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  اُمٌّ [<i>A mother</i> of a human being and of any animal]: (M, K:) the former is [said by some to be] the original of the latter: (S:) Aboo-Bekr says that the ه in the former is a radical letter: (TA:) or the former applies to a rational creature; and the latter, to [a rational and] an irrational: (K:) or, accord. to Az, the pl. of the former applies to the rational; and that of the latter, to the irrational: (TA:) the former sing. sometimes applies to an irrational creature: (IJ, TA:) [for some further remarks on both of these words and their pls., see the latter of them:] the pl. [of the former] is اُمَّهَاتٌ and [that of the latter is] اُمَّاتٌ: (T, S:) Az says that the امو is added in the former for the purpose of distinguishing between the daughters of Adam [to whom it is generally applied] and other animate beings.
