<b>اَزَلٌ</b>               1     <br>\

                  <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  قِدَمٌ [i. e. <i>Eternity, with respect to past time,</i> or <i>considered retrospectively; existence from eternity;</i> or <i>ancientness</i>] (S, K, TA) <i>that is without beginning;</i> (TA;) or the <i>continuance of existence in decreed times interminable in respect of the past;</i> like as اَبَدٌ is the continuance of existence in decreed times interminable in respect of the future; (KT;) or <i>that</i> [<i>existence,</i> or <i>time,</i>] <i>which has no extremity in its beginning;</i> like قِدَمٌ; and اَبَدٌ is that which has no extremity in its latter part; like بَقَا=ءٌ: the former is <i>existence without any beginning:</i> (Kull p. 31:) said to be from the phrase لَمْ يَزَلْ [“he, or it, has not ceased” to be &amp;amp;c.; i. e. “has ever” been &amp;amp;c. (see اَزَلِىٌّ)]: or, accord. to some, from اَزْلٌ signifying “narrowness;” because the intellect is prevented by its narrowness from perceiving its beginning: (MF:) ازل is a name for <i>that of which the mind is prevented by its narrowness from determining the limit of the beginning;</i> from اَزْلٌ meaning “narrowness;”; and ابد is a name for that of which the mind shrinks from, or shuns, the determining the limit of the end; from اُبُودٌ meaning the act of “shrinking” from a thing, or “shunning” it. (Kull pp. 30 and 31.) Hence the saying, كَانَ فِى الاَزَلِ قَادِرًا عَالِمًا [<i>He was,</i> or <i>has been, ever, powerful, knowing</i>]. (A, TA.) The phrase اَزَلَ الا=زَالِ [<i>During the space, without beginning, of all past times;</i> or <i>ever, in all past times;</i>] is like the phrase اَبَدَ الا=بَادِ; said to be no evidence of the use of ا=زَالٌ as a pl. of اَزَلٌ in a general way by the Arabs of the classical ages, as it is here added merely as a corroborative.

                  <i>the Ancient without beginning</i>]: and لَا اَزَلِىٌّ وَ لَا اَبَدِىٌّ [<i>not existing from eternity nor existing to eternity</i>]; and such is the present world: and اَبَدِىٌّ <br>\
                  غَيْرُ اَزَلِىّ [<i>existing to eternity without existing from eternity</i>]; and such is the world to come; the reverse of which [last] is impossible: (TA:) it is a rel. n. from اَزَلٌ: or, accord. to some, it is not [genuine] Arabic: (TA:) or it is originally يَزَلِىٌّ, a rel. n. from لَمْ يَزَلْ, (S, K,) a phrase applied to that which is قَدِيم; and is formed by contraction; (S;) then, the ى is changed into ا, as being easier of pronunciation; as in اَزَنِىٌّ, applied to a spear, in relation to ذُو يَزَن; (S, K,* Sgh, TA;) and as in اَثْرَبِىٌّ, applied to a blade, (S, Sgh, TA,) in relation to يَثْرِب: (TA:) so say some of the learned.
