                     ذ<br>\
                   is a conjunction, (S, M, K,) connected with what precedes it (Msb, Mughnee) so that neither what precedes it nor what follows it is independent, the one of the other. (Mughnee.) It denotes interrogation; (M, K;) or is used in a case of interrogation, (S, Msb,) corresponding to the interrogative اَ, and meaning اَىّ, (S,) or, as Z says, اَىُّ الاَمْرَيْنِ كَايِنٌ; [for an explanation of which, see what follows;] (Mughnee;) or, [in other words,] corresponding to the interrogative اَ, whereby, and by اَمْ, one seeks, or desires, particularization: (Mughnee:) it is as though it were an interrogative after an interrogative. (Lth, T.) Thus you say, اَزَيُدٌ فِى الدَّارِ اَمْ عَمْرٌو [<i>Is Zeyd in the house, or &#39;Amr?</i>]; (S, Mughnee;) i. e. which of them two (اَيُّهُمَا) is in the house? (S;) therefore what follows ام and what precedes it compose one sentence; and it is not used in commanding nor in forbidding; and what follows it must correspond to what precedes it in the quality of noun and of verb; so that you say, اَزَيْدٌ قَايِمٌ اَمع قَاعِدٌ [<i>Is Zeyd standing, or sitting?</i>] and اَقَامَ زَيْدٌ اَمْ <br>\
                  قَعَدَ [<i>Did Zeyd stand, or sit?</i>]. (Msb.) It is not to be coupled with اَ after it: you may not say, اَعِنْدَكَ زَيْدٌ اَمْ اَعِنْدَكَ عَمْرٌو. (S.) ―         -b2-  As connected in like manner with what goes before, it is preceded by اَ denoting equality [by occurring after سَوَا=ءٌ &amp;amp;c.], and corresponds thereto, as in [the Kur lxiii. 6,] سَوَا=ءُ عَلَيْهِمْ اَسْتَغْفَرْتَ لَهُمٌ لَمٌ تَسْتَغُفِرْ لَهُمٌ [It will be <i>equal to them whether thou beg forgiveness for them or do not beg forgiveness for them</i>]. (Mughnee.) ―         -b3-  It is also unconnected with what precedes it, (S, Msb, Mughnee,) implying always digression, (Mughnee,) preceded by an enunciative, or an interrogative, (S, Msb, Mughnee,) other than اَ, (Mughnee,) or by اَ not meant [really] as an interrogative but to denote disapproval, (Mughnee,) and signifies بَلْ, (Lth, Zj, T, S, M, Mughnee, K,) or بَلْ and اَ together, (Msb,) and this is its meaning always accord. to all the Basrees, but the Koofees deny this. (Mughnee.) Thus, using it after an enunciative, you say, اـِنَّهَا لَاـِبِلٌ اَمْ شَا=ءٌ [<i>Verily they are camels: nay,</i> or <i>nay but, they are sheep,</i> or <i>goats:</i> or <i>nay, are they sheep,</i> or <i>goats?</i>]: (S Msb, Mughnee:) this being said when one looks at a bodily form, and imagines it to be a number of camels, and says what first occurs to him; then the opinion that it is a number of sheep or goats suggests itself to him, and he turns from the first idea, and says, اَمْ شَا=ءٌ, meaning بَلْ, because it is a digression from what precedes it; though what follows بل is [properly] a thing known certainly, and what follows ام is opined. (S, TA.) And using it after an interrogative in this case, you say, هَلْ زيْدٌ <br>\
                  مُنْطَلِقٌ اَمْ عَمْرٌو [<i>Is Zeyd going away? Nay rather,</i> or, <i>or rather, is &#39;Amr?</i>]: you digress from the question respecting Zeyd&#39;s going away, and make the question to relate to &#39;Amr; so that ام implies indecisive opinion, and interrogation, and digression. (S.) And thus using it, you say, هَلْ زَيْدٌ <br>\
                  قَامَ اَمْ عَمْرٌو [<i>Did Zeyd stand? Nay rather,</i> or <i>or rather, did &#39;Amr?</i>]. (Msb.) And an ex. of the same is the saying [in the Kur xiii. 17], هَلْ يَسْتَوِى الْاَعْمَى وَالْبَصِيرُ اَمْ هَلْ تَسْتَوِى الظُّلُمَاتُ <br>\
                  وَالنُّورُ [<i>Are the blind and the seeing equal? Or rather are darkness and light equal?</i>]. (Mughnee.) And an ex. of it preceded by اَ used to denote disapproval is the saying [in the Kur vii. 194], اَلَهُمْ اَرْجُلٌ يَمْشُونَ بِهَا اَمْ لَهُمْ اَيْدٍ يَبْطِشُونَ بِهَا [<i>Have they feet, to walk therewith? Or have they hands to assault therewith?</i>]: for اَ is here equivalent to a negation. (Mughnee.) [It has been shown above that] اَمْ is sometimes introduced immediately before هَلْ: (S, K:) but IB says that this is when هل occurs in a phrase next before it; [as in the ex. from the Kur xiii. 17, cited above;] and in this case, the interrogative meaning of ام is annulled; it being introduced only to denote a digression. (TA.) ―         -b4-  It is also used as a simple interrogative; accord. to the assertion of AO; in  the sense of هَلْ; (Mughnee;) or in the sense of the interrogative اَ; (Lth, T, K) as in the saying, اَمْ عِنْدَكَ غَدَا=ءِ حَاضِرٌ, meaning <i>Hast thou a morning-meal ready?</i> a good form of speech used by the Arabs; (Lth, T;) and allowable when preceded by another phrase. (T.) ―         -b5-  And sometimes it is redundant; (AZ, T, S, Mughnee, K) in the dial. of the people of El-Yemen; (T;) as in the saying, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        يَا دَهْنَ اَمْ مَا كَانَ مَشْيِى رقَصَا<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        بَلْ قَدْ تَكُونُ مِشْيَتِى تَوَقُّصَا<br>\
                  </quote> (T, S, * [in the latter, يا هِنْدُ, and only the former hemistich is given,]) meaning <i>O Dahnà,</i> (the curtailed form دَهْنَ being used for دَهْنَا=ء,) <i>my walking was not,</i> as now in my age, [a feeble movement like] <i>dancing: but</i> in my youth, <i>my manner of walking used to be a bounding:</i> (T:) this is accord. to the opinion of AZ: but accord. to another opinion, ام is here [virtually] conjoined with a preceding clause which is suppressed; as though the speaker had said, يَا دَهْنَ اَكَانَ مَشْيِى <br>\
                  رَقَصَّا اَمْ مَا كَانَ كَذلِكَ. (A &#39;Hát, TA.)       -A2-  It is also used (T, Mughnee) in the dial. of the people of El-Yemen, (T,) or of Teiyi and Himyer, (Mughnee,) in the sense of ال, (T,) to render a noun determinate. (Mughnee.) So in the trad., لَيْسَ مِنَ امْبِرّ امْصِيامُ فِى امْسَفَرِ, (T, Mughnee,) i. e. الَيْسَ مِنَ البِرِّ الصِّيَامُ فِى السَّفَرِ [<i>Fasting in journeying is not</i> an act <i>of obedience</i> to God]. (T, and M in art. بر.) So too in the trad., اَلْا=نَ <br>\
                  طَابَ امْضَرْبُ <br>\
                  <i>Now fighting has become lawful;</i> as related accord. to the dial. of Himyer, for الضَّرْبُ. (TA in art. طيب.) It has been said that this form ام is only used in those cases in which the ل of the article does not become incorporated into the first letter of the noun to which it is prefixed; as in the phrase, خُذِ الرُّمْحَ وَارْكَبِ امْفَرَسَ [<i>Take thou the spear, and mount the mare,</i> or <i>horse</i>], related as heard in El-Yemen; but this usage may be peculiar to some of the people of that country; not common to all of them; as appears from what we have cited above.
