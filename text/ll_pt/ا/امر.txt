      ا=مرهُ, (Kr, M, K,) mentioned by A&#39;Obeyd also as a dial. var. of امَرَهُ: (Msb:) but A&#39;Obeyd says that ا=مَرْتُهُ and اَمرْتُهُ are syn. [in a sense different from that explained above, i. e.] as meaning كَثَّرْتُهُ. (TA.) You say, اَمَرَهُ بِهِ, (S, M, K,) and اَمَرَهُ اـِيَّاهُ, suppressing the prep., (M,) <i>He commanded, ordered, bade,</i> or <i>enjoined, him to do it.</i> (M, K.) And امَرْتُكَ اَنْ تَفْعَلَ, and لِتَفْعَلَ, and بِانْ تَفْعَلَ, <i>I commanded, ordered, bade,</i> or <i>enjoined, thee to do</i> [such a thing]. (M.) [And اَمَرَهُ بِكَذَا as meaning <i>He commanded him,</i> or <i>ordered him, to make use of such a thing; or the like:</i> whence, in a trad.,] اُمِرْتُ بِالسِّوَاكِ [<i>I have been commanded to make use of the tooth-stick</i>]. (El-Jámi&#39; es- Sagheer.) [And <i>He enjoined him such a thing;</i> as, for instance, patience.] The imperative of اَمَرَ is مُرْ; originally اوْمُرْ; which also occurs [with وَ in the place of و when the ا is pronounced with damm]: (M:) but [generally] when it is not preceded by a conjunction, (Msb,) i. e., by وَ or فَ, (T,) you suppress the ء, [i. e. the radical ء, and with it the conjunctive ا preceding it,] contr. to rule, and say, مُرْهُ بِكَذَا [<i>Command,</i> or <i>order,</i> or <i>bid,</i> or <i>enjoin, thou him to do such a thing</i>]; like as you say, كُلْ and خُذْ: when, however, it is preceded by a conjunction, the practice commonly obtaining is, to restore the وَاْمُرْ بِكَذَا, agreeably with analogy, and thus to say, اَمُرْ بِكَذَا. (Msb.) ―         -b2-  [You say also, اَمَرَ بِهِ فَقُتِلَ <br>\
                  <i>He gave an order respecting him, and accordingly he was slain.</i> And اَمَرَ لَهُ بِكَذَا <br>\
                  <i>He ordered that such a thing should be done, or given, to him</i>.] ―         -b3-  In the Kur [xvii. 17], اَمَرْنَا مُتْرَفِيهَا فَفَسَقُوا فِيهَا, so accord. to most of the readers, (T, &amp;amp;c.,) means <i>We commanded</i> [<i>its luxurious inhabitants</i>] to obey, <i>but they transgressed therein,</i> or <i>departed from the right way,</i> or <i>disobeyed:</i> (Fr, T, S, &amp;amp;c.:) so says Aboo-Is-hák; adding that, although one says, اَمَرتُ زَيْدًا فَضَرَبَ عَمْرًا, meaning <i>I commanded Zeyd to beat &#39;Amr, and he beat him,</i> yet one also says, اَمَرْتُكَ فَعَصَيْتَنِى [<i>I commanded thee, but thou disobeyedst me</i>]: or, accord. to some, the meaning is, <i>We multiplied its luxurious inhabitants;</i> (T;) and this is agreeable with another reading, namely, ↓ <br>\
      ا=مَرْنَا; (TA;) and a reading of El-Hasan, namely, اَمِرْنَا, like عَلِمْنَا, may be a dial. var., of the same signification: (M:) see 4, in two places: or it may be from الاـِمَارَةُ; (S, TA;) [in which case it seems that we should read ↓ <br>\
      اَمَّرْنَا; or, perhaps, اَمَرْنَا: see 2:] Abu-l-&#39;Áliyeh reads ↓ <br>\
      اَمَّرْنَا, and this is agreeable with the explanation of I&#39;Ab, who says that the meaning is, <i>We made its chiefs to have authority, power,</i> or <i>dominion.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  اَمَرَهُ, aor.      <br>\
                     اَمُرَ<br>\

[<i>He counselled,</i> or <i>advised, him</i>.] One says, مُرْنِى, meaning <i>Counsel thou me; advise thou me.</i> (A.) ―         -b5-  اَمَرَ بِاقْتِنَاصٍ, said  of a wild animal, means <i>He rendered</i> the beholder <i>desirous of capturing</i> him.
