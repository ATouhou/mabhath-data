(TA.) And hence the saying, in imprecating evil on a man, ا=هَةً لَكَ [May God cause <i>moaning to thee!</i>], and اَوَّةً لَكَ, with the ه suppressed, and with teshdeed to the و. (S.) [See also اَوَّةٌ in art. او.] And see ا=هِ above.       -A2-  [Also] <i>Measles:</i> thus in the phrase, used in imprecating evil on a man, ا=هَةً وَمَاهَةً [May God cause] <i>measles and small-pox</i> [to befall thee]!
