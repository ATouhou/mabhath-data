Accord. to MF, this is the proper signification, and the other significations here following are tropical. (TA.) [But in my opinion, the word in each of the next two senses, or at least in the former of them; if not strictly proper, is what is termed حَقِيقَةٌ عُرْفِيَّةٌ, i. e. a word so much used in a tropical sense as to be, in that sense, conventionally regarded as proper.] ―         -b2-  [<i>A skirt,</i> or <i>lower extremity,</i> of a garment, <i>reaching nearly,</i> or <i>quite, to the ground,</i> or <i>that is dragged upon the ground, when made to hang down:</i>] the <i>extremity,</i> of a garment, <i>that is next the ground,</i> and so <i>if not touching it</i> [<i>as well as if touching it</i>]; an inf. n. used in this sense: (Msb:) or the <i>part</i> of a waist-wrapper (اـِزَار), and of a garment [of any kind], <i>that is dragged</i> [<i>upon the ground</i>], (M, K,) <i>when it is made to hang down:</i> (M:) or the <i>part,</i> of an اـِزَار, and of a [garment of the kind called] رِدَا=ء, <i>that is made to hang down, and touches the ground:</i> and the <i>part,</i> of any kind of garment worn by a woman, <i>that the wearer drags upon the ground behind her:</i> (Lth, T:) or the <i>parts, all round,</i> of a woman&#39;s garment, <i>that fall upon the ground:</i> and the <i>portion that is made</i> <br>\
                  <i>to hang down,</i> of a woman&#39;s shift and of her قِنَاع [or head-covering]: you do not [properly] say of a man that he has a ذَيْل [but only when you liken the lower part of his garment to the similar part of a woman&#39;s garment]: a man&#39;s having a long garment, such as a shirt and a جُبَّة, [or his dragging the skirt thereof,] is termed اـِرْفَالٌ: (Khálid Ibn-Jembeh, T:) the pl. of ذَيْلٌ (in this sense, T, Msb, as relating to a shirt [&amp;amp;c.], S, and in all its senses, T, M) is اَذْيَالٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and اَذْيُلٌ (El-Hejeree, M, K) [both pls. of pauc.] and ذُيُولٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) which is a pl. of mult. (M.) Hence طُولُ الذَّيْلِ is a metonymical expression meaning (tropical:)  <i>Richness,</i> or <i>competency;</i> because long اَذْيَال generally pertain to the rich and the prodigal and the proud and self-conceited: (Er-Rázee, Har p. 493:) and you say, طَالَ ذَيْلُ فُلَانٍ, meaning (tropical:)  <i>The state,</i> or <i>condition, of such a one became good, and his wealth became abundant:</i> and هُوَ طَوِيلُ الذَّيْلِ, meaning (tropical:)  <i>He is rich.</i> (Har p. 319.) ―         -b3-  Of a horse (T, K) &amp;amp;c., (K,) [i. e.] of a horse and a camel and the like, (M,) The <i>tail:</i> (T, M, K:) or the <i>tail when long:</i> (TA:) or the <i>part, of the tail, that is made to hang down.</i> (M, K.) ―         -b4-  [(assumed tropical:)  Of a cloud, The <i>skirt;</i> or <i>lower, pendent, part:</i> used in this sense in the K voce هَيْدَبٌ.] ―         -b5-  ذَيْلُ الرِّيحِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>What is dragged along,</i> (T, S, O,) or <i>drawn together,</i> (M,) <i>by the wind, upon the ground,</i> (T, S, O, M,) <i>of dust</i> (T, M, O) <i>and rubbish:</i> (T, O:) or <i>what the wind leaves upon the sand,</i> (M, K,) <i>in the form of a rope,</i> (M,) <i>resembling the track of a</i> <br>\
