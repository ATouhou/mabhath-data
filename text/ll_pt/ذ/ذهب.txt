                  <i>He went, repaired, betook himself,</i> or <i>had recourse, to him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (TA.) And they say also, ذَهَبَ الشَّاْمَ [<i>He went to Syria</i>]; making the verb trans. without a particle; for although الشام is here a special adv. n., they liken it to a vague locality. (TA.) ―         -b3-  ذَهَبَ عَنْهُ <br>\
                  <i>He,</i> or <i>it, went from, quitted, relinquished,</i> or <i>left, him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  ذَهَبَ فِىالاَرْضِ, (A, Msb,) inf. n. ذَهَابٌ and ذُهُوبٌ and مَذْهَبٌ, <i>He went away</i> [<i>into the country,</i> or <i>in the land</i>]: (Msb:) [but it often means (assumed tropical:)  <i>he went into the open country,</i> or <i>out of doors, to satisfy a want of nature:</i> or simply] (tropical:)  <i>he voided his excrement,</i> or <i>ordure.</i> (A.) ―         -b5-  ذَهَبَ بِهِ <br>\

      ذهّبهُ, inf. n. تَذْهِيبٌ: (MF:) [all may likewise be rendered <i>he removed, dispelled, put away,</i> or <i>banished, it;</i> properly and tropically: and (assumed tropical:)  <i>he made it to cease; made away with it, did away with it, made an end of it; wasted, consumed, destroyed, exhausted, spent,</i> or <i>expended, it;</i> and these meanings may perhaps be intended by اَزَالَهُ, whereby the first is explained in the A and K, as are also the second and third in the K:] or, accord. to some, when ذَهَبَ is trans. by means of بِ, accompaniment is necessarily signified; but not otherwise; so that if you say ذَهَبَ بِهِ, the meaning is, <i>he went away with him,</i> or <i>it;</i> i. e., <i>accompanying him,</i> or <i>it;</i> [<i>he took away,</i> or <i>carried off</i> or <i>away, him,</i> or <i>it;</i>] but if you say ↓ <br>\
      اذهبهُ or ↓ <br>\
      ذهّبهُ, the meaning is, <i>he made him,</i> or <i>it, to go, go away, pass away,</i> or <i>depart, alone, without accompanying him,</i> or <i>it:</i> this, however, is not agreeable with the phrase in the Kur [ii. 16], ذَهَبَ اْللّٰهُ بِنُورِهِمْ [though this may be well rendered <i>God taketh away their light</i>]. (MF, TA.) [Hence,] one says, اَيْنَ <br>\
                  يُذْهَبُ بِكَ, which may mean (assumed tropical:)  <i>Where,</i> or <i>whither, wilt thou be taken away, and what will be done with thee and made to come to pass with thee,</i> if this be thine intellect? or, accord. to Mtr, it is a saying of the people of Baghdád, addressed to him whom they charge with foolish judgment or opinion, as meaning اَيْنَ يُذْهَبُ بِعَقْلِكَ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Where,</i> or <i>whither, is thine intellect taken away?</i>]. (Har p. 574.) [In like manner one says, ذَهَبَ عَقْلُهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>His reason,</i> or <i>intellect, quitted him,</i> or <i>forsook him; he became bereft of his reason,</i> or <i>intellect.</i> And ذَهَبَ فُوَادُهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>His heart forsook him,</i> or <i>failed him,</i> by reason of fear or the like.] And ذَهَبَ لَحْمُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>His flesh wasted away</i>].

And ذَهَبَ فِى الدِّينِ مَذْهَبًا (assumed tropical:)  <i>He formed,</i> or <i>held, an opinion,</i> or <i>a persuasion,</i> or <i>a belief, respecting religion:</i> or, accord. to Es-Sarakustee, <i>he introduced an innovation in religion.</i> (Msb.)
