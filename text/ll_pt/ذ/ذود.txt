      ذَوَّدْتُهَا, for] تَذْوِيدٌ signifies the same as ذِيَادٌ. (S.) And ذاد الاـِبَلِ عَنِ المَا=ءِ, (A, Msb,) aor. يَذُودُ, inf. n. ذَوْدٌ and ذِيَادٌ, <i>He</i> (the pastor) [<i>drove away,</i> or <i>repelled,</i> or] <i>kept back,</i> or <i>debarred, the camels from the water;</i> or <i>prevented them from coming to it.</i> (Msb.) And ذادهُ عَنْ <br>\
                  كَذَا, (A,) and ذُدْتُهُ, (S,) <i>He,</i> and <i>I, drove him away from such a thing.</i> (S, A. [And the like is said in the M.]) And ذاد عَنِ الحَرَمِ <br>\
                  <i>He repelled from,</i> or <i>defended, the sacred territory.</i> (L.) And الثَّوْرُ يَذُودُ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ بِمِذْوَدِهِ, i. e. (tropical:)  [<i>The bull repels from,</i> or <i>defends, himself</i>] <i>with his horn: and</i> <br>\
                  الفَارِسُ بِمِذْوَدِهِ, i. e. (tropical:)  [<i>the horseman</i>] <i>with his spear,</i> or <i>short spear.</i> (A.) And ذاد عَنْ <br>\
                  عِرْضِهِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He defended his honour.</i> (L.) And ذاد <br>\

                     اذادهُ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>He aided,</i> or <i>assisted, him to drive,</i> or <i>drive away,</i> (T, S, M, A,) <i>his camels.</i> (T, S, A.) [In the K, اَذَدْتُهُ is said to signify اَعَنْتُهُ عَلَى ذِيَادِ <br>\
                  اَهْلِهِ: but اهله is app. a mistake for اـِبِلِهِ: or عَنْ is omitted before اهله; and if so, the meaning is <i>I aided,</i> or <i>assisted, him to defend his family;</i> but in this latter case, we should read ذِيَادٍ, which would be less chaste than الذِّيَادِ.]    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>ذَوْدٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     ذَوْدٌ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>A number of camels, from three to ten:</i> (Lth, AZ, As, T, S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K:) this is the meaning that is of best repute: (TA:) [in this explanation in the T from AZ, and in the K, the nouns of number are mase.; and so in the next here following: in the rest, fem.:] or <i>from three to ten:</i> and <i>a little more:</i> (IAar, M:) or <i>from three to nine:</i> (M, L:) or <i>from three to fifteen:</i> or <i>from three to twenty;</i> (M, L, K;) and <i>a little more:</i> (L:) or <i>from three to thirty:</i> (M, L, K:) or <i>from two to nine:</i> (M, Mgh, L, K:) [said to be] applied only to <i>females:</i> (Lth, A&#39;Obeyd, T, M, Mgh, Msb, K:) so in the Bári&#39;: (Msb:) and it is of the fem. gender; (T, S, M, Msb, K;) i. e., the word is fem.: (MF:) but its dim. is [↓ <br>\
      ذُوَيْدٌ,] without ة; contr. to analogy: (M:) the word ذَوْدٌ is a pl., (M, K,) meaning a quasipl. n., (MF,) having no sing. (S, M, K) of the same root: (S:) or a sing.; (K;) and its pl. is اَذْوَادٌ: (T, S, M, A, Msb, K:) or a sing. and pl.: (M, K:) the Arabs said ثَلَاثُ اَذْوَادٍ and ثَلَاثُ ذَوْدٍ and so with all the inferior ns. of number, making ذَوْد a substitute for اَذْوَاد: and they also said ثَلَاثُ ذَوْدٍ meaning thereby <i>three she-camels.</i> (M, L.) It is said in a trad., لَيْسَ فِيمَا دُونَ خَمْسِ <br>\
                  ذَوْدٍ مِنَ الاـِبِلِ صَدَقَةٌ, (T, L,) or لَيْسَ فِىاَقَلَّ مِنْ <br>\
                  خَمْسٍ ذَوْدٍ صَدَقَةٌ, (T, Msb,) meaning [<i>There is not in the case of less than five</i>] <i>camels</i> [<i>any poorrate</i>]: for the poor-rate is incumbent on him who possesses five camels whether they be males or females. (L.) And in another trad. it is said,  <br>\
                  فِى خَمْسِ ذَوْدٍ شَاةٌ [<i>In the case of five camels, a sheep</i> or <i>goat</i> shall be given]. (Mgh.) And it is said in a prov., الذَّوْدُ اـِلَى الذَّوْدِ اـِبِلٌ [<i>A few she-camels with a few she-camels are a herd of camels</i>]; (T, S, M, A;) meaning that a little with a little is much; الى being here used in the sense of مَعَ: (S, A:) or الى is here used in its proper sense; a word signifying “ joined ” or the like being understood; (TA;) i. e. a few joined to a few becomes much: (M:) [or,] accord. to the K [and the T], this prov. shows that ذود is here used in the place of اِثْنَتَانِ [i. e. <i>two</i> she-camels]; for two added to two are a pl.; but this requires consideration.
