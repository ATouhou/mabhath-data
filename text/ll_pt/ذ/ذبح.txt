                  , (K,) inf. n. ذَبْحٌ (S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.) and ذُبَاحٌ, (K,) <i>He cut,</i> or <i>divided, lengthwise; clave; split; slit; rent,</i> or <i>rent open; ripped,</i> or <i>ripped open.</i> (S, Msb, K.) [Accord. to Fei,] this is the primary signification. (Msb.) [But see what follows.] You say, ذَبَحَ <br>\
                  فَاْرَةَ المِسْكَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He</i> (a perfumer, A) <i>ripped open the follicle,</i> or <i>vesicle, of mush,</i> (A, TA,) <i>and took forth the mush that was in it.</i> (TA.) [In the A and TA this is said to be tropical; the authors evidently holding it to be from ذَبَحَ in the sense here next following.] ―         -b2-  <i>He slaughtered</i> [for food, or <i>sacrificed,</i>] (L, TA) and animal, (Msb,) or a sheep or goat, (S, TA,) or an ox or a cow, and a sheep or goat, and the like, (Mgh,) [<i>in the manner prescribed by the law,</i> i. e.,] <i>by cutting the</i> <br>\

                  نَحَرَ: but correctly, الذَّبْحُ is in the throat; and النَّحْرُ is in the pit above the breast, between the collar-bones, where camels are stabbed: the latter word is used in relation to camels and bulls and cows; and the former, in relation to other animals: or, not improbably, both may have originally signified <i>the causing the soul to depart by wounding the throat, or the pit above the breast, which is the stabbing-place in the camel;</i> and may then have been applied in peculiar [and different] senses by the lawyers. (MF. [See also ذَكَاةٌ, in art. ذكو.]) Also (assumed tropical:)  <i>He slaughtered,</i> or <i>slew, in any manner.</i> (L.) [You say, ذَبَحَ عَنْهُ <br>\
                  <i>He slaughtered,</i> or <i>sacrificed, for him, by way of expiation.</i>] And ذَبَحَ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا (assumed tropical:)  [<i>They slaughtered,</i> or <i>slew, one another</i>]. (S, K.) And اَخَذَهُمْ بَنُو <br>\

      ذبّح (inf. n. تَذْبِيحٌ, KL) signifies the same as ذَبَحَ, except that it applies [only] to many objects; whereas the latter applies to few and to many: thus it is said in the Kur [ii. 46, and in like manner in xiv. 6], يُذَبِّحُونَ اَبْنَا=ءَكُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>They slaughtering,</i> or <i>slaying, your sons</i>], accord. to the reading commonly obtaining. (Aboo-Is-hák, TA.) ―         -b3-  Hence, (tropical:)  <i>He killed;</i> because الذَّبْحُ [in its proper sense, when the object is an animal,] is one of the quickest modes of killing. (TA.) It is said in a trad., (Mgh, TA,) cautioning against accepting the office of a Kádee, (Mgh,) مَنْ جُعِلَ قَاضِيًا بَيْنَ <br>\
                  النَّاسِ فَكَاَنَّمَا ذُبِحَ بِغَيْرِ سِكِّينٍ (tropical:)  [<i>Whoso is made a Kádee among the people, he is as though he were slaughtered without a knife</i>]: (Mgh, TA: *) expl. by some as meaning, (tropical:)  <i>he is as though he were killed</i> [&amp;amp;c.]. (TA.) ―         -b4-  [Hence, also, because الذَّبْحُ renders the flesh of an animal allowable, or lawful, as food,] (tropical:)  <i>It rendered allowable,</i> or <i>lawful:</i> as salt and the sun and the fishes called نِينَان (pl. of نُونٌ) do wine, by changing its quality, as is said in a trad. (TA.) ―         -b5-  Also (tropical:)  <i>He broached,</i> or <i>pierced,</i> a دَنّ [or wine-jar, <i>making a hole in the mouth,</i> or <i>removing the clay that closed the mouth</i>], <i>so as to draw forth the contents.</i> (S, A, Msb, K.) ―         -b6-  And (tropical:)  <i>He,</i> or <i>it, choked.</i> (K, TA.) You say, ذَبَحَتْهُ العَبْرَةُ (tropical:)  <i>Weeping choked him.</i> (A, TA.) ―         -b7-  And, said of thirst, (tropical:)  <i>It affected him severely,</i> or <i>distressed him.</i> (A, TA.) ―         -b8-  ذَبَحَتِ اللِّحْيَةُ فُلَانًا (tropical:)  The <i>beard flowed down beneath the chin of such a one so that the anterior portion of the part beneath his lower jaw was apparent:</i> in which case, the man is said to be بِلِحْيَتِهِ ↓ <br>\

                  رَاْسَهُ signifies <i>He lowered his head,</i> in inclining his body in prayer; like دبّح: and accord. to Lth, ذبّح signifies <i>he lowered his head,</i> in inclining his body in prayer, <i>so that it became lower than his back:</i> but Az says that this is a mistake, and that the correct word is دبّح, with the unpointed د.

      ذَبَايِحُ means <i>Animals sacrificed to the Jinn,</i> or <i>Genii:</i> for it was customary for a man, when he bought a house, or drew forth [for the first time] the water of a spring, and the like, to sacrifice an animal to the Jinn with the view of avoiding ill luck, (A, TA,) lest some disagreeable accident should happen to him from the Jinn thereof: (A:) and the doing this is forbidden.
