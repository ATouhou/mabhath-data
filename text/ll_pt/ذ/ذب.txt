      ذُبَابَةٌ: (S, Msb, K:) one should not say ذِبَّانَةٌ [as the vulgar do in the present day]: (S:) or one should not say ↓ <br>\
      ذُبَابَةٌ, though El-Ahmar and Ks are related to have used this word [as meaning <i>a kind of fly</i>]; for ذُبَابٌ is a sing. [properly speaking], and is used as such in the Kur xxii. 72: (M:) the pl. (of pauc., S, Msb) is اَذِبَّهٌ and (of mult., S, Msb) ذِبَّانٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and ذُبٌّ, (M, K,) the last mentioned by Sb, accord. to the dial. of Temeem. (M.) One says, اـِنَّهُ لَاَوْهَى مِنَ الذُّبَابِ [<i>Verily he is more frail than the fly</i>]. (A.) And هُوَ اَهْوَنُ عَلَىَّ مِنْ طَنِينِ <br>\
                  الذُّبَابِ [<i>He is more contemptible to me than the buzzing of the fly</i>]. (A.) مَنْجَى الذُّبَابِ [<i>The refuge of the fly</i>] is a prov., applied to him who is protected by his ignobleness. (Har p. 332: there written مَنْجَا; and in two places, منجا.) And اَبُو الذُّبَابِ [<i>The father of the fly</i>] is an appellation used as meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>He who has stinking breath;</i> and some say اَبُو الذِّبَّانِ [<i>the father of the flies</i>]: (M, TA:) and is especially applied to &#39;Abd-El-Melik Ibn-Marwán: (M, A, TA:) whence the saying, اَبْخَرُ مِنْ اَبِى الذُّبَابِ (A, TA) and اَبِى الذِّبَّانِ (TA) [<i>More stinking in breath than Abu-dh-Dhubáb</i> and <i>Abu-dh-Dhibbán</i>]. ―         -b2-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  <i>Evil,</i> or <i>mischief;</i> (A, K;) and <i>annoyance,</i> or <i>harm;</i> as in the saying, اَصَابَنِى ذُبَابٌ (tropical:)  [<i>Evil, &amp;amp;c., befell me</i>]; (A;) and اَصَابَ فُلَانًا مِنْ <br>\

(M.) ―         -b7-  (tropical:)  The اـِنْسَان [as meaning the <i>pupil,</i> or <i>apple,</i>] of the eye: (AZ, T, S, M, A, K:) so in the saying, هُوَ اَعَزُّ عَلَىَّ مِنْ <br>\
                  ذُبَابِ العَيْنِ (tropical:)  [<i>He is dearer to me than the apple of the eye</i>]: (A:) [ISd says,] I think it to be so termed as being likened to the ذُبَاب [properly so called; i.e. the fly]. (M.) And الذُّبَابُ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>A black speck,</i> or <i>spot, in the interior of the</i> <br>\
                  حَدَقَة [or <i>dark part</i>] <i>of the eye of the horse.</i> (M, K.) The pl. is as above. (M.) ―         -b8-  ذُبَابُ السَّيْفِ (T, S, M, A, Msb, K) and ↓ <br>\

(AZ, T, TA.) [The swords of the Arabs, in the older times, were generally straight, twoedged, and tapering to a point; and so are many of them in the present day; a little wider towards the point than towards the hilt.] Hence the saying, ثَمَرَةُ السَّوْطِ يَتْبَعُهَا ذُبَابُ السَّيْفِ (tropical:)  [<i>The knot,</i> or <i>tail, at the end of the whip is followed by the point of the sword;</i> i. e., whipping (if it effect not the desired correction) is followed by slaughter].
