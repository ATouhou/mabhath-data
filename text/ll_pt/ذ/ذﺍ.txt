                     ذ<br>\
                  &lt;/form&gt; is said by Aboo-&#39;Alee to be originally ذَىْ; the ى, though quiescent, being changed into ا: (M:) or it is originally ذَيَى or ذَوَى; the final radical letter being elided: some say that the original medial radical letter is ى because it has been heard to be pronounced with imáleh [and so it is now pronounced in Egypt]; but others say that it is و, and this is the more agreeable with analogy. (Msb.) It is a noun of indication, [properly meaning &lt;i&gt;This,&lt;/i&gt; but sometimes, when repeated, better rendered &lt;i&gt;that,&lt;/i&gt;] relating to an object of the masc. gender, (S, M, K,) such as is near: (I&#39;Ak p. 36:) or it relates to what is distant [accord. to some, and therefore should always be rendered &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;]; and هٰذَا, [which see in what follows,] to what is near: (K in art. هَا: [but the former is generally held to relate to what is near, like the latter:]) or it is a noun denoting anything indicated that is seen by the speaker and the person addressed: the noun in it is ذَ, or ذ alone: and it is a noun of which the signification is vague and unknown until it is explained by what follows it, as when you say ذَا الرَّجُلُ [&lt;i&gt;This man&lt;/i&gt;], and ذَا الفَرَسَ [&lt;i&gt;This horse&lt;/i&gt;]: and the nom. and accus. and gen. are all alike: (T:) the fem. is ذِى (T, S, M, K, but omitted in the CK) and ذِهْ, (S, M, K, but omitted in the CK,) the latter used in the case of a pause, (S,) with a quiescent ه, which is a substitute for the ى, not a sign of the fem. gender, (S, M,) as it is in طَلْحَهْ and حَمْزَهْ, in which it is changed into ة when followed by a conjunctive alif, for in this case the ه in ذِه remains unchanged [but is meksoorah, as it is also in other cases of connexion with a following word]; and one says also ذهِى; (M;) and تَا and تِهْ: (S and K &amp;amp;c. in art. تا:) for the dual you say ذَانِ and تَانِ; (M;) ذَانِ is the dual form of ذَا (T, S) [and تَانِ is that of تَا used in the place of ذِى]; i. e., you indicate the masc. dual by ذَانِ in the nom. case, and ذَيْنِ in the accus. and gen.; and the fem. dual you indicate by تَانِ in the nom. case, and تَيْنِ in the accus. and gen.: (I&#39;Ak p. 36:) the pl. is اُلَا=ءِ [or اُلَا=ءِ] (T, S, and I&#39;Ak ib.) in the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, (I&#39;Ak,) and اُولَى [or اُلَى] (T, I&#39;Ak) in the dial. of Temeem; each both masc. and fem. (I&#39;Ak ib. [See art. الى.]) You say, ذَا اَخُوكَ [&lt;i&gt;This is thy brother&lt;/i&gt;]: and ذِىاُخْتُكَ [&lt;i&gt;This is thy sister&lt;/i&gt;]: (T:) and لَاا=تِيكَ فِى ذِى السَّنَةِ [&lt;i&gt;I will not come to thee in this year&lt;/i&gt;]; like as you say فى هٰذِهِ السَّنَةِ and فى هٰذِى السَّنَةِ; not فى ذَا السَّنَةِ, because ذا is always masc. (As, T.) And you say, ذَانِ اَخَوَاكَ [&lt;i&gt;These two are thy two brothers&lt;/i&gt;]: and تَانِ اُخْتَاكَ [&lt;i&gt;These two are thy two sisters&lt;/i&gt;]. (T.) And اُولَا=ءِ اـِخْوَتُكَ [&lt;i&gt;These are thy brothers&lt;/i&gt;]: and اُولَا=ءِ <br>\
                  اَخَوَاتُكَ [&lt;i&gt;These are thy sisters&lt;/i&gt;]: thus making no difference between the masc. and the fem. in the pl. (T.) ―         -b2-  The هَا that is used to give notice, to a person addressed, of something about to be said to him, is prefixed to ذَا [and to ذِى &amp;amp;c.], (T, S, M, K,) and is a particle without any meaning but inception: (T:) thus you say هٰذَا, (T, S, M,) and some say هٰذَاا, adding another ا; (Ks, T;) fem. هٰذِى, (T, S, M,) and [more commonly] هٰذِهْ in the case of a pause, (M,) and هٰذِهِ in other cases, (T, S,) and هَاتَا, and some say هٰذَاتِ, but this is unusual and disapproved: (T:) dual هٰذَانِ for the masc., and هَاتَانِ for the fem.; (T;) said by IJ to be not properly duals, but nouns formed to denote duals; (M;) and many of the Arabs say هٰذَانِّ; (T;) some, also, make هٰذَانِ indecl., like the sing. ذَا, reading [in the Kur xx. 66] اـِنَّ هٰذَانِ <br>\
                  لَسَاحِرَانِ [&lt;i&gt;Verily these two are enchanters&lt;/i&gt;], and it has been said that this is of the dial. of Belhárith [or Benu-l-Hárith] Ibn-Kaab; but others make it decl., reading اـِنَّ هٰذَايْنِ لَسَاحِرَانِ: (S, TA: [see, however, what has been said respecting this phrase voce اـِنَّ:]) the pl. is هٰوُلَا in the dial. of Temeem, with a quiescent ا; and هٰوُلَا=ءِ in the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, with medd and hemz and khafd; and هٰوُلَا=ءٍ in the dial. of Benoo- &#39;Okeyl, with medd and hemz and tenween. (AZ, T.) The Arabs also say, لَا هَا اْللّٰهِ ذَا, introducing the name of God between هَا and ذَا; meaning &lt;i&gt;No, by God; this&lt;/i&gt; is [my oath, or] that by which I swear. (T.) In the following verse, of Jemeel, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        وَاَتَى صَوَاحِبُهَا فَقُلْنَ هٰذَا اْلَّذِى<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        مَنَحَ المَوَدَّةَ غَيْرَنَا وَجَفَانَا<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [it is said that] هَذَا is for اَذَا, (M,) i. e., ه is here substituted for the interrogative hemzeh (S * and K in art. ها) [so that the meaning is, &lt;i&gt;And her female companions came, and said, Is this he who gave love to other than us, and treated us unkindly?&lt;/i&gt;]: or, as some assert, هَذَا is here used for هٰذَا, the ا being suppressed for the sake of the measure. (El-Bedr El-Karáfee, TA in art. ها.) ―         -b3-  One says also ذَاكَ, (T, S, M, K,) affixing to ذَا the ك of allocution, [q. v., meaning &lt;i&gt;That,&lt;/i&gt;] relating to an object that is distant, (T, *, S, and I&#39;Ak p. 36,) or, accord. to general opinion, to that which occupies a middle place between the near and the distant, (I&#39;Ak pp. 36 and 37,) and this ك has no place in desinential syntax; (S, and I&#39;Ak p. 36;) it does not occupy the place of a gen. nor of an accus., but is only affixed to ذا to denote the distance of ذا from the person addressed: (T:) for the fem. you say تِيكَ (T, S) and تَاكَ; (S and K in art. تا, q. v.;) but not ذِيكَ, for this is wrong, (T, S,) and is used only by the vulgar: (T:) for the dual you say ذَانِكَ (T, S) and ذَيْنِكَ, as in the phrases جَا=ءَنِى ذَانِكَ الرَّجُلَانِ [&lt;i&gt;Those two men came to me&lt;/i&gt;] and رَاَيْتُ ذَيْنُكَ الرَّجُلَيْنِ, [&lt;i&gt;I saw those two men&lt;/i&gt;]; (S;) and some say ذَانِّكَ, with teshdeed, (T, S,) [accord. to J] for the purpose of corroboration, and to add to the letters of the noun, (S,) but [accord. to others] this is dual of ذٰلِكَ, [which see in what follows,] the second ن being a substitute for the ل; (T on the authority of Zj and others;) and some say تَانِّكَ also, with tesh-deed, (T, S,) as well as تَانِكَ: (T in this art., and S and K in art. تا, but there omitted in some copies of the S:) the pl. is [اُولَاكَ and] اُولٰيِكَ. (T, S.) هَا is also prefixed to ذَاكَ; so that you say, هٰذَاكَ زَيْدٌ [&lt;i&gt;That is Zeyd&lt;/i&gt;]: (S, TA:) and in like manner, for the fem., you say هَاتِيكَ and هَاتَاكَ: (S and K in art. تا:) but it is not prefixed [to the dual nor] to اُولٰيِكَ. (S.) ―         -b4-  You also add ل in ذَاكَ, (T, S, M, K,) as a corroborative; (TA;) so that you say ذٰلِكَ, [meaning &lt;i&gt;That,&lt;/i&gt;] (T, S, M, K,) relating to an object that is distant, by common consent; (I&#39;Ak pp. 36 and 37;) or hemzeh, saying ذَايِكَ, (K,) but some say that this is a &lt;pb n=&quot;948&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; mispronunciation: (TA in art. ذوى:) for the fem. you say تِلْكَ and تَالِكَ: the dual of ذٰلِكَ is ذَانِّكَ, mentioned above; and that of the fem. is ثَانِّكَ: (T: [and in the K in art. تا, تَالِكَ is also mentioned as a dual, as well as a sing.:]) and the pl. is اُولَالِكَ. (S and M and K voce اُولَى or اُلَى or اُلَا. [See art. الى.]) هَا is not prefixed to ذٰلِكَ (S) nor to تِلْكَ [nor to اُولَالِكَ] because, as IB says, the ل denotes the remoteness of that which is indicated and the ها denotes its nearness, so that the two are incompatible. (TA in art. تا.) ―         -b5-  In the saying in the Kur [ii. 256, the Verse of the Throne], مَنْ ذَا الَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ اـِلَّا بِاـِذْنِهِ, (T, TA,) accord. to Th and Mbr, (TA,) هٰذَا is &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  ذا [so that the meaning is, &lt;i&gt;Who is this that shall intercede with Him but by his permission?&lt;/i&gt;]: (T, TA:) or it may be here redundant [so that the meaning is, &lt;i&gt;Who is he that &amp;amp;c.?&lt;/i&gt;]. (Kull.) ―         -b6-  It is sometimes &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  اَلَّذِى. (T, S, M.) So in the saying, مَا ذَا رَاَيْتَ [&lt;i&gt;What is it that thou sawest?&lt;/i&gt;]; to which one may answer, مَتَاعٌ حَسَنٌ [A goodly commodity]. (Sb, S.) And so in the Kur [ii. 216], وَ يَسْاَلُونَكَ مَا مَا ذَا يُنْفِقُونَ [&lt;i&gt;And they ask thee what&lt;/i&gt; amount of their property &lt;i&gt;is it that they shall expend&lt;/i&gt; in alms]; (T, M, TA;) accord. to those who make the reply to be in the nom. case; for this shows that ما is [virtually] in the nom. case as an inchoative, and ذا is its enunciative, and ينفقون is the complement of ذا; and that ما and ذا are not to be regarded as one word: [or] this is the preferable way of explanation in the opinion of Sb, though he allowed the other way, [that of regarding ما and ذا as one word, together constituting an inchoative, and ينفقون as its enunciative, (see Ham p. 521,)] with [the reply in] the nom. case: (M:) and هٰذَا, also, is used in the same sense: (TA:) so too ذا in مَا ذَا هُوَ and مَنْ ذَا هُوَ may be considered as &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  الذى; but it is preferable to regard it as redundant. (Kull.) ―         -b7-  It is [said to be] redundant also in other instances: for ex., in the trad. of Jereer, as related by Aboo-&#39;Amr Ez-Záhid, who says that it is so in this instance: يَطْلُعُ عَلَيْكُمْ <br>\
                  رَجُلٌ مِنْ ذِى يَمَنٍ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ مَسْحَةٌ مِنْ ذِى مُلْكٍ [&lt;i&gt;There will come to you a man from El-Yemen, having upon his face an indication of dominion&lt;/i&gt;]. (TA. [But this evidently belongs to art. ذُو; in which see a similar ex. (اَتَيْنَا ذَا يَمَنٍ). See also other exs. there.]) ―         -b8-  [كَذَا lit. means &lt;i&gt;Like this:&lt;/i&gt; and hence, &lt;i&gt;thus:&lt;/i&gt; as also هٰكَذَا. ―         -b9-  It is also often used as one word, and, as such, is made the complement of a prefixed noun; as in سَنَةَ كَذَا and فِى سَنَةِ كَذَا <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;In such a year.&lt;/i&gt; See also art. كَذَا: and see the letter ك.] ―         -b10-  هٰذَا is sometimes used to express contempt, and mean estimation; as in the saying of &#39;Áïsheh respecting &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn- &#39;Amr Ibn-&#39;Abbás, يَا عَجَبًا لِاْبْنِ عَمْرٍو هٰذَا [&lt;i&gt;O wonder&lt;/i&gt; (meaning &lt;i&gt;how I wonder&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;at Ibn-&#39;Amr, this&lt;/i&gt; fellow!]. (Kitáb el-Miftáh, cited in De Sacy&#39;s “ Gram. Ar., ” 2nd ed., i. 442.) [يَا هٰذَا often occurs as addressed to one who is held in mean estimation: it is like the Greek        <br>\
      &lt;orth lang=&quot;gr&quot;&gt;ὦ οὗτος&lt;/orth&gt;, and virtually like the vulgar Arabic expression يَا اَنْتَ, and the Latin &lt;i&gt;heus tu;&lt;/i&gt; agreeably with which it may be rendered &lt;i&gt;O thou;&lt;/i&gt; meaning &lt;i&gt;O thou fellow;&lt;/i&gt; an appellation denoting mean estimation being understood: in the contrary case, one says يَا فَتَى. See also, in what follows, a usage of ذَاكَ and ذٰلِكَ. ―         -b11-  هٰذَا in a letter and the like is introduced when the writer breaks off, turning to a new subject; and means “ This is all that I had to say on the subject to which, it relates: ” what follows it is commenced with the conjunction وَ.] ―         -b12-  One says, لَيْسَ بِذَاكَ [and لَيْسَ بِذٰلِكَ], meaning &lt;i&gt;It is not approved:&lt;/i&gt; for, [like as a person held in mean estimation is indicated by هٰذَا, which denotes a thing that is near, so,] on account of its high degree of estimation, a thing that is approved is indicated by that whereby one indicates a thing that is remote. (Kull voce ليس.) [See also what next follows.] ―         -b13-  ذٰلِكَ الكِتَابُ in the Kur ii. 1 is said by Zj to mean هٰذَا الكِتَابُ [&lt;i&gt;This book&lt;/i&gt;]: but others say that ذلك is here used because the book is remote [from others] in respect of highness and greatness of rank. (TA.) ―         -b14-  كَذٰلِكَ [lit. &lt;i&gt;Like that,&lt;/i&gt; often means &lt;i&gt;so,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;in like manner:&lt;/i&gt; and ―         -b15- ] &lt;i&gt;Let that suffice&lt;/i&gt; [thee or] you. (TA in art. ذعر, from a trad.) ―         -b16-  The dim. of ذَا is ذَيَّا: (T, S, M:) you form no dim. of the fem. ذِى, using in its stead that of تَا, (S,) which is تَيَّا: (T:) the dim. of the dual [ذَانِ] is ذَيَّانِ: (S:) and that of [the pl.] اُولَا=ءِ [and اُولَى] is اُولَيَّا=ءِ [and اُولَيَّا]: (T:) ―         -b17-  that of هٰذَا is ذَيَّا, like that of ذَا; [and you may say هٰذَيَّا also; for] that of هٰوُلَا=ءِ is هٰوُلَيَّا=ءِ: (T:) ―         -b18-  that of ذَاكَ is ذَيَّاكَ: (S, K: *) and that of تَاكَ is تَيَّاكَ: (K in art. تا:) ―         -b19-  that of ذٰلِكَ is ذَيَّالِكَ: (S, K: *) and that of تِلْكَ is تَيَّالِكَ. (S.) A rájiz says, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اَوْ تَحْلِفِى بِرَبِّكَ العَلِىِّ<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اـِنِّى اَبُو ذَيَّالِكِ الصَّبِىِّ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Or thou shalt swear by thy Lord, the High,&lt;/i&gt; that &lt;i&gt;I am the father of that little child&lt;/i&gt;]: (S, TA:) he was an Arab who came from a journey, and found that his wife had given birth to a boy whom he disacknowledged. (TA.)       -A2-  ذَا is also the accus. case of ذُو, q. v.   &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\
