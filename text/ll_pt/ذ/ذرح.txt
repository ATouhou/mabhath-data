      ابو ذرحرحةَ imperfectly decl., (Kr,) [The <i>cantharis, or Spanish fly;</i>] <i>a kind of insect of a red colour,</i> (S, A, K,) <i>spotted,</i> or <i>speckled, with black, which flies,</i> (S, K,) <i>and is of a poisonous nature;</i> (S, K;) <i>a kind of insect larger than the common fly, variegated with red and black and yellow, having a pair of wings with which it flies, and of a deadly poisonous nature:</i> when they desire to allay the heat of its poison, they mix it with lentils, and so mixed it becomes a remedy for him who has been bitten by a mad dog: (IO:) Ibn-Ed-Dahhán the Lexicologist says that the ذرّوح is <i>a kind of fly variegated with yellow and white;</i> and <i>what is called</i> <br>\
                  فَرْخَةُ الدَّيْلَمِ: by certain of the acute physicians it is described as حَيَوَانٌ دُودِىٌّ, app. meaning <i>a worm-like animal, of the size of the finger, and of a conical shape, the head of which is at the thickest part of it:</i> and IDrst says that it is <i>a flying insect, resembling the</i> <br>\
                  زُنْبُور [or <i>hornet</i>], <i>and of a deadly poisonous nature.</i> (TA.) It is observed in the S, with reference to ذُرُّوحٌ, that, in the opinion of Sb, لَيْسَ فِى الكَلَامِ فُعَّوْلٌ بِوَاحِدَةٌ; meaning, there is not in the language a subst. (as distinguished from an epithet) of the measure فُعَّوْلٌ; (marg. note in a copy of the S;) or his meaning is, [there is not a word of this measure] with damm alone; (MF;) or with a single dammeh, that is, to the ف; but with dammeh to the ف and to the ع: (IB:) and it is added in the S, that he (Sb) used to say سَبُّوحٌ and قَدُّوسٌ: Sb, however, also mentions the forms سُبُّوحٌ and قُدُّوسٌ. (MF.) The pl. is ذَرَايِحُ: (S, K:) in the L, ذُرَّاحٌ is also said to be a pl.: and Kr mentions ذَرَارِحُ; but AHát says that this last is only used in poetry. (TA.) Sb says that the sing. of ذَرَارِيحُ is ذُرَحْرَحٌ, (or, in other words, that one of the [insects called] ذراريح is [called] ذرحرح,) which is of the measure فُعَلْعَلٌ, and of which the dim. is ↓ <br>\
      ذُرَيْرِحٌ, formed by throwing out the first ذُريْرِحٌ; [not ح, as it would be by rule, making it of the measure ذُرَيْحِرٌ, and its curtailed original فُعَيْلِعٌ;] for there is not in the language a word of the measure فعلع, except فعلع, (S,) which is the proper name of a man. (MF.) AHát cites a verse in which حَدْرَدٌ occurs as pl. of ذَرَانِحُ; but the correct reading is ذرنوح. (MF.)    </entryFree> <br>\
