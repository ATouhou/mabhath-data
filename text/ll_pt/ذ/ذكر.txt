                     ذَكُرَ<br>\
                  ,] inf. n. ذِكْرَى, (S, A, Msb,) which is fem., (Msb,) and imperfectly decl., (S,) and ذِكْرٌ (A, K) [and ذُكْرٌ, or, accord. to EtTebreezee, (Ham p. 26,) the latter of these two but not the former, or, as is said in the Msb., both are properly substs., and a distinction is made between them, as will be shown below,] and تَذْكَارٌ, (K,) <i>He preserved it in his memory:</i> (K, * TA:) <i>he remembered it;</i> (S, A;) as also ذَكَرَهُ بِقَلْبِهِ [to distinguish it from ذَكَرَ in a sense afterwards to be explained], (S, Msb,) and ↓ <br>\
      تذكّرهُ; (S, A;) and ↓ <br>\
      اِدَّكَرَهُ (S, K, TA,) originally اِذْتَكَرَهُ (S,) and اِذَّكَرَهُ (TA, and so in the CK,) and اِذْدَكَرَهُ (K,) and ↓ <br>\
      استذكرهُ, (AZ, K,) signify the same as تذكّرهُ (K) [as explained above]: ↓ <br>\
      تذكّرهُ signifies also <i>he became reminded of it;</i> (Msb;) [and so ↓ <br>\
      ادّكرهُ and its variations: and ↓ <br>\
      استذكرهُ seems properly to signify, as also ↓ <br>\
      تذكرّهُ, <i>he recollected it;</i> or <i>called it to mind:</i> and <i>he sought to remember it:</i> and ↓ <br>\
      استذكر and ↓ <br>\
      تذكّر used intransitively, <i>he sought,</i> or <i>endeavoured, to remember.</i>] You say, ذَكَرْتُ الشَّىْءَ بَعْدَ النِّسْيَانِ [<i>I remembered the thing after forgetting</i>]: (S:) and ذَكَرْتُ <br>\
                  المَنْسِىَّ and ↓ <br>\
      تَذَكَّرْتُهُ [<i>I remembered the thing forgotten,</i> and <i>I became reminded of it,</i> or <i>I recollected it</i>]: (A:) and بَعْدَ اَمَهٍ ↓ <br>\
      ادّكر, occurring in the Kur [xii. 45, accord. to one reading of the last word], means <i>He remembered</i> [or <i>became reminded</i>] <i>after forgetting.</i> (S) And رَبَطَ فِى <br>\
                  بِهِ حَاجَتِهِ ↓ <br>\
      اـِصْبَعِهِ خَيْطًا يَسْتَذْكِرُ [<i>He tied upon his finger a thread</i> or <i>string, seeking to remember,</i> or <i>recollect,</i> or <i>call to mind, thereby the thing that he wanted:</i> such a thread or string is commonly called رَتِيمَةٌ:]: (AZ:) and ↓ <br>\
      استذكر is used alone with the like signification [i. e. <i>He sought to remember</i>]: and also signifies <i>He studied</i> a book <i>and preserved it in his memory,</i> accord. to the K; but accord. to other lexicons, <i>he studied</i> a thing <i>in order to remember it,</i> or <i>preserve</i> it <i>in his memory:</i> (TA:) you say, بِدِرَاسَتِهِ ↓ <br>\
      استذكر <br>\
                  <i>He sought to remember by his studying</i> of a book. (A.) ―         -b2-  ذَكَرَ حَقَّهُ, (K,) inf. n. ذِكْرٌ (TA,) <i>He was mindful of his right,</i> or <i>claim; and did not neglect it.</i> (K.) Agreeably with this explanation, the words in the Kur [ii. 231, &amp;amp;c.,] وَاْذْكُرُوا نِعْمَةَ اْللّٰهِ عَلَيْكُمْ have been rendered <i>And be ye mindful of, and neglect not to be thankful for, the favour of God conferred upon you:</i> like as an Arab says to his companion, اُذْكُرْ حَقِّىعَلَيْكَ <br>\
                  <i>Be thou mindful of my claim upon thee; and neglect it not.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  [In like manner also are explained the words] وَاْذْكُرُوا مَا <br>\
                  فِيهِ in the Kur [ii. 60], <i>And study ye what is in it, and forget it not:</i> or <i>think ye upon what is in it:</i> or <i>do ye what is in it.</i> (Bd.) ―         -b4-  One says, مَا اْسْمُكَ اَذْكُرْ, (Fs and Lb, and so in a copy of the K,) or اَذْكُرْهُ, (so in another copy of the K, and in the TA,) the hemzeh of اَذْكُرْ being disjunctive, (Lb, K,) [in the CK we find مَا اسمُكَ <br>\
                  اَذْكِرْهُ بقطعِ الهَمْزَةِ مِنْ اَذْكَر, as though the reading were اَذْكَرْهُ with a disjunctive hemzeh from اَذْكَرَ, which is manifestly wrong,] and with fet-h, because it is the hemzeh of the first person of a triliteral [unaugmented] verb, and with the ر mejzoom, because it is the complement of an interrogative phrase: (Lb:) it is expressive of disapprobation, (Lb, K,) and means, <i>Acquaint me with thy name:</i> [or, lit., <i>what is thy name?</i>] <i>I will remember it,</i> or <i>I will bear it in mind</i> (اذكره): the conditional phrase [if thou tell it to me] is suppressed because unnecessary, on account of frequent usage of the saying, and because what remains is indicative of it: (Lb, MF:) the saying is a prov.; and is also related with the conjunctive hemzeh, [اْذْكُرْ, or اْذْكُرْ; in which case it is most appropriately rendered, <i>What is thy name? Say:</i> or <i>Tell it</i>] but the reading with the disjunctive hemzeh is that which is commonly known: (TA:) [for]       -A2-  ذَكَرَهُ, aor.      <br>\
                     ذَكُرَ<br>\
                  , (TA,) inf. n. ذِكْرَى, fem., [and imperfectly decl,] (Msb,) and ذِكْرٌ and ذُكْرٌ, (TA,) [or the former of these two (which is the most common of all) but not the latter, or, as is said in the Msb, both are properly substs., and a distinction is made between them, as will be shown below,] also signifies <i>He mentioned it; told it; related it; said it;</i> (TA;) and so ذَكَرَهُ بِلِسَانِهِ [to distinguish it from ذَكَرَ in the first sense explained above]. (S, Msb.) You say ذَكَرْتُ لِفُلَانٍ حَدِيثَ <br>\
                  كَذَاوَكَذَا <br>\
                  <i>I mentioned,</i> or <i>told,</i> or <i>related, to such a one the story of such and such things.</i> (TA.) And ذَكَرَ اْمْرَاُ بِمَا لَيْسَ فِيهِ [<i>He mentioned,</i> or <i>spoke of, a man as having that attribute which was not in him</i>]. (El-Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer voce مَنْ) ―         -b2-  And ذَكَرَهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He magnified Him,</i> namely, God; <i>celebrated, lauded,</i> or <i>praised, Him; asserted his unity;</i> (Zj;) [saying سُبْحَانَ اْللّٰهِ, and الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ, and اَللّٰهُ اَكْبَرُ; or لَااـِلَاهَ اـِلَّااْللّٰهُ; or هُوَاْللّٰهُ; or the like.] ―         -b3-  [And, in like manner, (assumed tropical:)  <i>He spoke well of him,</i> namely, a man; <i>mentioned him with approbation; eulogized, praised,</i> or <i>commended, him:</i> for ذَكَرَهُ بِالجَمِيلِ, or بِخَيْرٍ See ذِكْرٌ below.] ―         -b4-  Also, contr., [for ذَكَرَهُ <br>\
                  بِالقَبِيحِ or بِشَرٍّ] (assumed tropical:)  <i>He spoke evil of him; men-</i> <br>\
                  <i>tioned him with evil words;</i> (Fr;) <i>mentioned his vices,</i> or <i>faults; spoke evil of him behind his back,</i> or <i>in his absence, saying of him what would grieve him if he heard it, but saying what was true;</i> or merely <i>said of him what would grieve him:</i> an elliptical expression in this and in the contrary sense; what is meant being known. (Zj.) One says to a man, لَيِنْ ذَكَرْتَنِى لَتَنْدَمَنَّ, meaning [<i>Verily, if thou mention me</i>] <i>with evil words</i> [<i>thou will assuredly repent</i>]: and in like manner the verb is used in the Kur xxi. 37 and 61: and &#39;Antarah says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        لَاتَذْكُرِى فَرَسِى وَمَا اَطْعَمْتُهُ<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        فَيَكُونَ جِلْدُكَ مِثْلَ جِلْدِ الاَجْرَبِ<br>\
                  </quote> meaning <i>Mention thou not reproachfully</i> [<i>my horse, and what I have given him for food, for,</i> if thou do, <i>thy skin will be like the skin of the scabby</i>]: (Fr, T:) but AHeyth disallows this signification of the verb, and explains the saying of &#39;Antarah as meaning, <i>Be not thou fond of mentioning my horse,</i> and my preferring him before the family. (T, TA.) ―         -b5-  ذَكَرَ فُلَانَةَ, inf. n ذِكْرٌ, [expressly said to be] with kesr, [so in the CK, and I think it the right reading,] or ذَكْرٌ, [so in a MS. copy of the K, and in the TA,] with fet-h, [so in the TA,] <i>He demanded such a one in marriage:</i> or <i>he addressed himself to demand her in marriage:</i> (K:) [as though the mentioning a woman implied a desire to demand her in marriage:] it occurs in one of these two senses in a trad. (TA.)       -A3-  ذَكَرَهُ, inf. n. ذَكْرٌ, with fet-h, <i>He struck him upon his penis.</i> (K.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  , (S, A, * Msb, K,) and ذكّرهُ بِهِ, (Kur xiv. 5, &amp;amp;c.,) inf. n. تَذْكِرَةٌ (A, TA) and تَذْكِيرٌ, (K, TA,) and quasi-inf. n. ↓ <br>\
      ذِكْرَى imperfectly decl.; (A, * K, * TA;) and ايّاهُ ↓ <br>\
      اذكرهُ; (S, Msb, K;) <i>He reminded him of,</i> or <i>caused him to remember, him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (S, Msb, K.) ―         -b2-  And ذكّر, (TA,) inf. n. تَذْكِيرٌ (K) [and تَذْكِرَةٌ also, as in the Kur xx. 2], <i>He exhorted; admonished; exhorted to obedience; gave good advice, and reminded of the results of affairs; reminded of what might soften the heart, by the mention of rewards and punishments.</i> (K, TA.) Thus the verb is used in the Kur lxxxviii. 21. (TA.)       -A2-  Also ذكّرهُ, inf. n. تَذْكِيرُ, <i>He made it</i> (a word) <i>masculine; contr. of</i> <br>\

                  الاُخْرَى is said by some to signify (assumed tropical:)  <i>That one of them may make the other to be in the legal predicament of a male:</i> [meaning that both of them together shall be as one man:] or, accord. to others, <i>one of them may remind the other.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  It is said in a trad., فَذَكِّرُوهُ ↓ <br>\
      القُرْا=نُ ذَكَرٌ (tropical:)  <i>The Kur-án is eminently excellent</i> [lit., <i>masculine</i>]: <i>therefore do ye hold it and know it and describe it as such.</i> (K, TA. [In the CK, for ذَكَرٌ is put ذِكْرٌ.]) ―         -b4-  [Hence,] ذكّرهُ, (TA,) inf. n. تَذْكِيرٌ, (K,) <i>He put to it,</i> namely a sword, (TA,) and the head of an axe &amp;amp;c., (K,) <i>an edge of steel.</i> (K, * TA.)

                  <i>She</i> (a woman, S, A, or other female, TA) <i>brought forth a male,</i> (S, A, K,) or <i>males.</i> (Mgh.) It is said in a prayer for a woman in labour, اَيْسَرَتْ وَاَذْكَرَتْ <br>\
                  <i>May she have an easy birth, and may she bring forth a male child.</i> (A.) And you say also, اذكرت بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>She brought him forth a male, and hardy:</i> (TA from a trad.:) or <i>a male, and sharp and cunning.</i> (Mgh.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>Thou art in my mind.</i> (ISd, Lb.) ―         -b2-  The words in the Kur [xxix. 44] وَلَذِكْرُ اْللّٰهِ اَكْبَرُ admit of two explanations: <i>The remembrance of God is better</i> for a man than a man&#39;s remembrance of a man: and <i>the remembrance of God is better</i> as more efficacious in forbidding evil conduct than is prayer. (TA.) ―         -b3-  ذِكْرٌ also signifies <i>Memory; a certain quality of the mind, by which a man is able to remember what he cares to know;</i> like حِفُظٌ, except that this latter term is used with regard to the preservation of a thing [in the mind], whereas the former is used with regard to calling it to mind.
