                  , and زوّجهُ اـِلَيْهِ, [inf. n. تَزْوِيجٌ,] <i>He coupled,</i> or <i>paired, a thing with a thing; united it to it as its fellow,</i> or <i>like.</i> (TA.) So in the Kur [xliv. 54 and lii. 20], زَوَّجْنَاهُمْ بِحُورٍ عِينٍ <br>\
                  <i>We will couple them,</i> or <i>pair them,</i> [<i>with females having eyes like those of gazelles:</i>] (S, Mgh, K, TA:) the meaning is not the تَزْوِيج commonly known, [i. e. marriage,] for there will be no [such] تزويج in Paradise. (MF, TA.) And so in the Kur [lxxxi. 7], وَاـِذَا النُّفُوسُ زُوِّجَتْ <br>\
                  <i>And when the souls shall be coupled,</i> or <i>paired,</i> or <i>united with their fellows:</i> (TA:) i. e., with their bodies: (Bd, Jel:) or, each with its register: (Bd:) or with its works: (Bd, TA:) or the souls of the believers with the حُور, and those of the unbelievers with the devils: (Bd:) or when each sect, or party, shall be united with those whom it has followed. (TA.) And so in the phrase, زَوَّجْتُ اـِبِلِى <br>\
                  <i>I coupled,</i> or <i>paired, my camels, one with another:</i> (A:) or زَوَّجْتُ بَيْنَ الاـِبِلِ <br>\
                  <i>I coupled,</i> or <i>paired, every one of the camels with another.</i> (TA.) So too in the Kur [xlii. 49], اَوْ يُزَوِّجُهُمْ <br>\
                  ذُكْرَانًا وَاـِنَاثًا <br>\
                  <i>Or He maketh them couples,</i> or <i>pairs, males and females:</i> or, accord. to AM, <i>maketh them of different sorts</i> [or <i>sexes</i>], <i>males and females:</i> for ―         -b2-  تَزْوِيجٌ signifies [also] The <i>making to be of different sorts</i> or <i>species</i> [&amp;amp;c.].

                  <i>of pigeons</i>]: (A:) and اِشْتَرَيْتُ زَوْجَى حَمَامٍ [<i>I bought a pair of pigeons</i>], meaning a male and a female: (S:) and زَوْجَا نِعَالٍ [<i>A pair of sandals</i>]: (S, A:) and in like manner زَوْجَيْنِ is used in the Kur xi. 42 and xxiii. 28; (S;) meaning a male and a female: (Bd, Jel:) or, accord. to the M, زَوْجٌ signifies <i>one of a pair</i> or <i>couple:</i> and also <i>a pair</i> or <i>couple together:</i> (TA:) and in like manner says AO, (Mgh, Msb,) and IKt, and IF: (Msb:) and ISh says that it signifies <i>two;</i> (Mgh;) and so says IDrd: (Msb:) so that you say, هُمَا زَوْجٌ as well as هُمَا زَوْجَانِ [meaning <i>They two are a pair,</i> or <i>couple</i>]; (S, K, TA;) like as you say, هُمَا سَوَا=ءٌ and هُمَا سِيَّانِ: (S, TA:) and عِنْدِى زَوْجُ نِعَالٍ, meaning [<i>I have</i>] <i>two</i> [<i>sandals</i>]; and زَوْجَانِ, meaning <i>four:</i> (Msb:) or زَوْجُ حَمَامٍ as meaning a male and a female [of pigeons] is a phrase which should not be used; one to which the vulgar are addicted: (TA:) IAmb says, the vulgar are wrong in thinking that زَوْجٌ signifies <i>two;</i> for the Arabs used not to employ such a phrase as زَوْجُ حَمَامٍ, but used to say زَوْجَانِ مِنَ الحَمَامِ, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) meaning a male and a female; (TA;) and زَوْجَانِ مِنَ الخِفَافِ, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) meaning the right and the left [of boots]: (TA:) nor did they apply the term زَوْجٌ to <i>one</i> of birds, like as they applied the dual, زَوْجَانِ, to <i>two;</i> but they applied the term فَرْدٌ to the male, and فَرْدَةٌ to the female: (Mgh, Msb:) Es-Sijistánee, also, says that the term زَوْجٌ should not be applied to <i>two,</i> neither of birds nor of other things, for this is a usage of the ignorant; but to every two, زَوْجَانِ: (Msb:) Az says that the grammarians disapprove the saying of ISh that زَوْجٌ signifies <i>two</i> of any things, (Mgh, * TA,) and that زَوْجَانِ مِنْ خِفَافٍ signifies [<i>Two pairs of boots,</i> or] <i>four</i> [<i>boots</i>]; for زَوْجٌ with them signifies <i>one</i> [<i>of a pair</i> or <i>couple</i>]: a man and his wife [together] are termed زَوْجَانِ: and ثَمَانِيَةَ اَزْوَاجٍ in the Kur [vi. 144 and xxxix. 8] means <i>Eight ones</i> [<i>of pairs</i> or <i>couples</i>]: the primary meaning of زَوْجٌ being that first mentioned in this paragraph; (TA:) in the Kur xxii. 5 and 1. 7 [it seems to be implied that it means <i>pair</i> or <i>couple;</i> but more probably in these instances] it means <i>sort,</i> or <i>species:</i> (Bd, Jel:) it is also expl. by the word لَوْنٌ [used in this last sense]: (T, TA;) in the Kur xxxviii. 58, its pl. اَزْوَاجٌ means اَلْوَانٌ and اَنْوَاعٌ [i. e. <i>sorts,</i> or <i>species</i>] of punishment: F explains the sing. as meaning لَوْنٌ مِنَ الدِّيبَاجِ وَنَحْوِهِ [<i>a sort,</i> or <i>species, of silk brocade and the like</i>]; but his restricting the signification by the words من الديباج ونحوه is not right, as is shown by a citation, in the T, of a verse of El-Aashà, in which he uses the phrase كُلُّ زَوْجٍ مِنَ الدِّيبَاجِ [<i>every sort,</i> or <i>species, of silk brocade</i>], as an ex. of زوج in the sense of لون. (TA.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] A woman&#39;s <i>husband:</i> and a man&#39;s <i>wife:</i> in which latter sense ↓ <br>\
      زَوْجَةٌ is also used; (S, M, A, Mgh, * Msb, K; *) as in a verse of El-Farezdak cited in art بول, conj. 10; (S, Mgh;) but it is disallowed by As; (TA;) and the former word is the one of high authority, (Mgh, Msb,) and is that which occurs in the Kur, in ii. 33 and vii. 18, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) and in iv. 24, (Mgh, TA,) and in xxxiii. 37: (Mgh:) AHát says that the people of Nejd call a wife ↓ <br>\
      زَوْجَةٌ, and that the people of the Haram use this word: but ISk says that the people of El-Hijáz call a wife زَوْجٌ; and the rest of the Arabs, ↓ <br>\
      زَوْجَةٌ: the lawyers use this latter word only, as applied to a wife, for the sake of perspicuity, fearing to confound the male with the female: (Msb:) the pl. of زَوْجٌ is اَزْوَاجٌ (Msb, K *) and زِوَجَةٌ; (K;) and the pl. of ↓ <br>\
      زَوْجَةٌ is زَوْجَاتٌ (A, Mgh, Msb) and اَزْوَاجٌ also; (A, Msb;) and اَزَاوِيجُ occurs [as a pl. pl., i. e. pl. of اَزْوَاجُ,] in a verse cited by ISk. (TA in art. ناج.) ―         -b3-  [Hence also,] <i>A consociate, an associate,</i> or <i>a comrade:</i> (A:) its pl. in this sense is اَزْوَاجٌ, (S, A, K,) occurring in the Kur xxxvii. 22. (S, A.) ―         -b4-  And <i>A fellow,</i> or <i>like:</i> pl. اَزْوَاجٌ: in this sense, each one of a pair of boots is the زوج of the other; and the husband is the زوج of the wife; and the wife, the زوج of the husband. (TA.) You say, عِنْدِى مِنْ هٰذَا اَزْوَاجٌ <br>\
                  <i>I have, of this, fellows,</i> or <i>likes.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  As used by arithmeticians, (Mgh, Msb,) <i>contr. of</i> <br>\
                  فَرْدٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) i. e. it signifies <i>An even number; a number that may be divided into two equal numbers;</i> (Msb;) as, for instance, four, and eight, as opposed to three, and seven: (Mgh:) pl. اَزْوَاجٌ. (S, Mgh.) One says زَوْجٌ اَوْ فَرْدٌ [<i>Even or odd?</i>], like as one says خَسًا اَوْ زَكًا [or rather زَكًا اَوْ خَسًا] and شَفْعٌ اَوْ وِتْرٌ.
