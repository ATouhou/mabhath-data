                  ثَنَوِيَّة [or <i>asserters of the doctrine of Dualism</i>]: (S, O, K:) or <i>one who asserts his belief in</i> [<i>the two principles of</i>] <i>Light and Darkness:</i> or <i>one who does not believe in the world to come, nor in the Deity:</i> (O, K:) or <i>one who does not believe in the world to come nor in the unity of the Creator:</i> (T, Msb:) or <i>one who conceals unbelief and makes an outward show of belief:</i> (K:) an arabicized word, (S, Msb,) originally Pers., so they say, (Msb,) from الزَّنْدُ, which is a book belonging to them [i. e. the book of Zoroaster]: (PS:) [or from the Pers. زَنْدِيك, meaning <i>magian,</i> or <i>fire-worshipper:</i> and this seems to be its primary meaning; as De Sacy says in his “ Chrest. Ar., ” 2nd ed., ii. 274:] or, accord. to IDrd, it is an arabicized word from the Persian زِنْدَه, (Mgh, [thus in my copy, app. for زَنْدَهْ, in which the ه may be, as it is in many other instances, an affix denoting some kind of relationship,]) or زَنْدَ كِرْ, (TA, as from the L, [but not very clearly written, and with an erasure, such as to suggest that the original and right reading may be زَنْدْ گِيرْ, which may be rendered <i>holder of the Zend,</i> but]) which is expl. as meaning <i>he</i> [<i>who</i>] <i>asserts his belief in the eternity,</i> or <i>the endlessness, of the present world:</i> (Mgh, TA:) or it is arabicized from زَنْ دِين i. e. woman&#39;s religion: (O, K:) or the right explanation is this: that it is a term of relation to the زَنْد, which is the book of Mánee the Magian, who was in the time of Bahrám the son of Hurmuz the son of Sáboor [or Shápoor], and who claimed to be successor to the Messiah, on whom be peace; and, desiring fame, composed this book, which he hid in a tree, and then took forth: الزَّنْدُ, in their language, is “ explanation; ” and he meant that this was the explanation of the book of Zará- dusht [or Zoroaster] the Persian; and in it he held that there are two gods, Light and Darkness, Light creating good, and Darkness creating evil: (TA:) or, accord. to the “ Mefáteeh el-&#39;Uloom, ” زِنْدِيقٌ means <i>a follower of Mánee,</i> and also <i>a follower of Mezdek,</i> who (i. e. Mezdek) appeared in the days of Kubádh, and asserted that possessions and women were in common, and put forth a book which he called زند, which is the book of the Magians, that was brought by Zará- dusht, whom they assert to have been a prophet: and the companions of Mezdek were named in relation to [this] زند; which word, being arabicized, was converted into زِنْدِيقٌ: (Mgh:) Th says that زِنْدِيقٌ is not of the [genuine] language of the Arabs; (Mgh, TA;) and when the Arabs desire to express the meaning in which it is commonly used, (Mgh, * Msb, TA,) which is <i>one who does not hold any religion, and who asserts his belief in the endlessness of time,</i> (Msb,) they say مُلْحِدٌ, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) i. e. [<i>a deviater from the right religion,</i> or] <i>an impugner of religions,</i> (Msb,) and دَهْرِىٌّ: (Mgh, TA:) some say that it is from الزَّنْدَقَةُ; because the زنديق straitens himself: (L, TA:) an Arab of the desert is related to have explained it as meaning <i>one who looks much into things,</i> or <i>affairs:</i> (Msb:) the pl. is زَنَادِقَةٌ and زَنَادِيقُ; (S, O, Msb, K;) the latter being the original pl., and the ة of the former being a substitute for the suppressed ى of the latter.
