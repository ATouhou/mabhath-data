                  فَاْرِيتُ مَشَارِقَهَا وَمَغَارِبَهَا [<i>The earth was collected together to me, and I was shown its eastern parts and its western parts</i>]. (S, TA.)

Zeyd Ibn-Thábit said, in relation to the expression in the Kur [ii. 261] نُنْشِزُهَا, [accord. to one reading, or reciting,] هِىَ زَاىٌ فَزَيِّهَا, meaning [<i>It is</i> <br>\

You say of a man, تزيّا بِزِىٍّ حَسَنٍ [<i>He invested himself with a beautiful,</i> or <i>goodly, garb,</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (Lth, TA.)
