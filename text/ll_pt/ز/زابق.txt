                  زِيْبِق [i. e. <i>quicksilver</i>]. (Mgh.) [It is said that] the verb [from زيبق, or rather its inf. n.,] is التَّزْبِيقُ: (TA:) [but see مَزَاْبَقٌ, below.]    </entryFree> <br>\

                  , (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) thus pronounced by some, (S,) and this is the form preferred by ElMeydánee, and that which is in the Fs and its Expositions, (TA,) rendered quasi-coordinate to زِيْبِرٌ and ضِيْبِلٌ, (S, in which it is mentioned in art. زبق,) also pronounced زِيْبَقٌ, (S, K, [in both of which it is implied that this is the more common form, and such is the case now,]) and it is allowable to pronounce it زِيبِقٌ, (Msb,) an arabicized word, (S, K,) of well-known meaning, [i. e. <i>Quicksilver,</i>] (Msb, K,) originally Pers. [Cِيوَهْ and زِيبَقْ or زِيبِقْ]; (S;) <i>i. q.</i> <br>\

(K.) ―         -b2-  Hence, as being likened thereto, (TA,) زِيْبِقٌ and زِيْبَقٌ signify also (tropical:)  A man who is <i>light, inconstant, unsteady, irresolute,</i> or <i>fickle.</i> (Ibn- &#39;Abbád, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
