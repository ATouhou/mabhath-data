                   is of the measure اَفْعَلُ, (S,) like اَحْمَرُ: (K:) or, as some say, of the measure فَعْيَل; but this is a weak assertion, for it is said that there is no Arabic word of this measure; مَرْيَمُ being a foreign proper name, and ضَهْيَا being disputed. (MF, TA.) [In some of its senses it is an epithet, and used as such: in some, app. an epithet in which the quality of a subst. is predominant: and in some, a simple subst.: but in all its senses it is imperfectly decl.; and therefore seems to be originally an epithet.] ―         -b2-  <i>Brisk, lively, sprightly, agile,</i> or <i>quick.</i> (K.) ―         -b3-  A man <i>who walks with short steps:</i> (TA:) and <i>short in stature and in step;</i> (K, TA;) likewise applied to a man. (TA.) ―         -b4-  <i>Ignoble, base,</i> or <i>base-born.</i> (K.) The <i>offspring of fornication</i> or <i>adultery;</i> or the <i>offspring of fornication, begotten on a slave.</i> (Abu-l-Mekárim, TA.) One <i>whose origin,</i> or <i>lineage, is suspected;</i> or <i>an adopted son;</i> or one <i>who claims as his father a person who is not his father;</i> or <i>who is claimed as a son by a person who is not his father;</i> syn. دَعِىٌّ. (S, K.) ―         -b5-  <i>A devil:</i> (K:) accord. to some, a dial. var. of اَزَبُّ. (TA.) ―         -b6-  The <i>hedge-hog.</i> (IAar, K.) ―         -b7-  <i>A disagreeable, a disapproved,</i> or <i>an abominable, thing</i> or <i>affair.</i> (K.) ―         -b8-  <i>A calamity,</i> or <i>misfortune.</i> (K.) ―         -b9-  <i>Much water:</i> (AA, S:) and so اَذْيَبُ. (K in art. ذيب.) ―         -b10-  [<i>A south-easterly wind;</i> i. e.] the [<i>wind termed</i>] نَكْبَا=ء [q. v.] <i>that blows between the</i> <br>\

                  جَنُوب: (S, M, K:) or the <i>south wind,</i> or <i>a southerly wind;</i> syn. جَنُوبٌ; (M, K;) of the dial. of Hudheyl; so affirm Mbr in his “ Kámil ” and IF and Et-Tarábulusee: IAth says that the people of Mekkeh use this appellation much; and it is related to be God&#39;s name for what men call the جنوب: Sh says that the people of El-Yemen, and those who voyage upon the sea between Juddah and &#39;Adan, cali the جنوب by the name of الاَزْيَبُ, and know not any other name for it; and that is because it is boisterous, and stirs up the sea, turning it upsidedown: [whence it seems to mean <i>the boisterous,</i> or <i>violent:</i>] ISh says that ذَاتُ اَزْيَبَ signifies <i>any violent wind.</i> (L,TA.) ―         -b11-  [Hence it appears that it signifies also <i>Violence.</i>] ―         -b12-  Also <i>Enmity.</i> (S, K.) ―         -b13-  And <i>Briskness, liveliness, sprightliness, agility,</i> or <i>quickness:</i> (ISk, S, K, TA:) [see also اَذْيَبُ:] it is fem.: one says, مَرَّ فُلَانٌ <br>\
