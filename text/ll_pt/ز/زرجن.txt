                  , (S, K,) which is also written زُرْجُونٌ, like عُصْفُورٌ, is mentioned in art. زرج and also in  the present art. by the author of the K, though he charges J with error in mentioning it in this art. because مُزَرَّجٌ is used by a rájiz as meaning “ intoxicated: ” whereas J is not in error, but is right, in doing thus; for the ن is radical accord. to the generality of the lexicologists and the authors on inflection, like the س in قَرَبُوسٌ; and the rájiz above referred to elided the ن in forming مُزَرَّجٌ because he imagined it to be augmentative: (MF in art. زرج:) it signifies <i>Wine;</i> (S, K;) and is a Pers. word, (As, Sh, Seer, S,) originally زركون, [i. e. زَرْگُونْ,] (Sh, TA,) meaning “ goldcoloured: ” (As, Sh, Seer, S:) or it signifies, (S, Mgh,) or signifies also [like as does عِنَبٌ, of which the primary signification is “ grapes ”], (K,) the <i>grape-vine;</i> (ISh, S, Mgh, K;) n. un. with ة; (ISh, TA;) and pl. زَرَاجِينُ: (Mgh:) it has this meaning in the dial. of Et-Táïf: (ISh, TA in art. زرج:) or the <i>shoots of a grape-vine:</i> (Mgh, K:) thus in the dial. of Et-Táïf and ElGhowr: (TA in the present art.:) or <i>a shoot that is planted, of a grape-vine.</i> (AHn, TA.) ―         -b2-  Also <i>A certain red dye.</i> (El-Jarmee, S, K.) ―         -b3-  And <i>Water that remains</i> or <i>stagnates,</i> or <i>collects,</i> or <i>remains long and becomes altered,</i> or <i>becomes yellow and altered, in a rock:</i> (K in art. زرج:) or <i>clear water that remains</i> or <i>stagnates,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>in a mountain.</i> (MF, TA.)   </entryFree> <br>\
