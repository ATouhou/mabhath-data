                   (S, M, Msb, K) and زُوَانٌ (M, Msb) and زِيَانٌ (M, K) and زِوَانٌ (M, Msb) and زَا=نٌ (K) and زَوَانٌ, (K in art. زون, q. v.,) but the like of سَحَابٌ is said by ISd to be a form not seen by him on the authority of anyone, (TA,) [<i>A noxious weed, that grows among wheat;</i> app. <i>darnel-grass;</i> the <i>lolium temulentum</i> of Linn.; so in the present day;] <i>a certain grain,</i> (Msb,) the <i>bitter grain,</i> (M,) <i>that mingles with wheat,</i> (S, M, Msb, K,) <i>and gives a bad quality to it:</i> (Msb:) [<i>the grain thus called is often, accidentally,</i> or <i>carelessly, mixed with wheat, and causes giddiness: the plant resembles that now called</i> <br>\
                  شَيْلَم, <i>a decoction of which is used as an anæsthetic:</i> it is said in the K in art. شلم that the زوان is the same as the شَيْلَم: but it is said in the TA in that art., on the authority of AHn, that the grain of the شَيْلَم does not intoxicate, (as that of darnel-grass is well known to do in a certain manner,) and that it is very bitter: and in the K in art. دنق it is said that the دَنْقَة is the زُوَان, and the دَنَقَة is the شَيْلَم: the TA states more fully in that art. that the دَنْقَة is said by AHn to be the زُوَان that is in wheat, which is cleared therefrom; and that the دَنَقَة is said by AA to be the شَيْلَم: Forskål mentions the زِوَان and the شَيْلَم, as different species, among undetermined plants, and describes the former thus: <i>zizania</i> Aleppensibus notissima: inter triticum viget: si semina restant farinæ [sic] mixta, hominem reddunt ex panis esu temulentum: messores plantam non separant; sed post triturationem vanni aut cribri ope semina rejiciunt: (Flora Aegypt.

      اَزْاَنِىٌّ, applied as epithets to a spear, are dial. vars. of يَزَنِىٌّ (K, TA) and اَزَنِىٌّ: (TA:) spears being thus called in relation to ذُو يَزَنٍ, one of the Kings of Himyer: (S in art. يزن:) as also ا=زَنِىٌّ and اَيْزَنِىٌّ, both formed by transposition. (TA.)   </entryFree> <br>\
