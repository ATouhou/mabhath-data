                  , said of a young bird, <i>Its feathers came forth:</i> (S in art. زغب, and K:) or <i>its feathers began to come forth,</i> (Lth, TA,) <i>before their becoming black.</i> (TA.) Also said of plumage, <i>It began to come forth.</i> (Lth, TA.) And said of hair, (S in art. زغب, and K,) as also ازلعبّ, (TA,) <i>It grew forth after having been shaven:</i> (S, K:) <i>it began to grow forth, soft:</i> and said of the hair of an old man, <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  اِزْغَابَّ [<i>it was,</i> or <i>became, downy</i>]. (TA.)
