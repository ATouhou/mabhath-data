                   [<i>Ginger; amomum zinziber;</i>] <i>a certain plant growing in the country of the Arabs, in the land of &#39;Omán,</i> (AHn, TA,) <i>and in El-Yemen also;</i> (TA;) <i>well known:</i> (S:) [or the <i>root thereof;</i>] <i>a certain root,</i> or <i>roots,</i> (accord. to different copies of the K,) <i>creeping beneath the ground;</i> (K, TA;) <i>burning,</i> or <i>biting, to the tongue;</i> (TA;) <i>growing like the stalks of the papyrus,</i> (K, TA,) <i>and the</i> <br>\
                  رَاسَن [mentioned below]: <i>there is no wild sort of it; nor is it a tree that is eaten fresh like as herbs,</i> or <i>leguminous plants, are eaten; but it is used in a dry state; and its conserve is the best of conserves; and the best thereof is what is brought from the country of the Zinj and China:</i> (TA:) <i>it has a property that is heating,</i> or <i>warming, digestive, lenitive in a small degree, strengthening to the venereal faculty,</i> (K, TA,) <i>clearing to the phlegm,</i> (TA,) <i>sharpening to the intellect,</i> (K * TA,) <i>and exhilarating:</i> (TA:) <i>if mixed with the moisture of the liver of the goat, and dried, and pulverized, and used as a collyrium, it removes the film</i> [<i>upon the eye</i>], <i>and obscurity of the sight.</i> (K, TA.) ―         -b2-  It is mentioned in the Kur, where it is said, [lxxvi. 17 and 18,] كَانَ مِزَاجُهَا زَنْجَبِيلًا عَيْنًا فِيهَا <br>\
                  تُسَمَّى سَلْسَبِيلًا [<i>The admixture whereof shall be</i> <br>\
                  زنجبيل, <i>a fountain therein named Selsebeel</i>]: i. e. it shall have the flavour of زنجبيل [or ginger], which the Arabs esteem very pleasant: it may mean that زنجبيل is [essentially] in the wine of Paradise: or that it is the admixture thereof: or that it is a name for the fountain whence this wine is taken, and which is named Selsebeel also. (Az, O, TA.) As some assert, (ISd, TA,) it means also <i>Wine</i> [absolutely]. (S, ISd, K.) ―         -b3-  زَنْجَبِيلُ الكِلَابِ <br>\
                  <i>A certain herb,</i> or <i>leguminous plant, the leaves of which are like</i> [<i>those of</i>] <i>the</i> <br>\
                  خِلَاف [or <i>salix Aegyptia</i>], <i>and the twigs are red: it clears the</i> [<i>discoloration of the face termed</i>] كَلَف, <i>and the</i> [<i>spots in the skin termed</i>] نَمَش; <i>and it kills dogs;</i> (K;) wherefore it is named in relation to them. (TA.) ―         -b4-  زَنْجَبِيلُ العَجَمِ <br>\
                  <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  الاُشْتُرْغَازُ [a word of Persian origin, now applied by Arabs to <i>A species of carline thistle</i>]. (K.) [Accord. to Freytag, <i>Horminum,</i> or <i>salvia silvestris:</i> but this, I believe, is what is called in Pers. اُشْتُرْغَان.] ―         -b5-  زَنْجَبِيلُ الشَّامِ <br>\
