      تزكّى: (K in art. زكى:) it is said of seed-produce, (S, Msb, Er-Rághib, TA,) and of wealth, or cattle &amp;amp;c., and of other things: of anything that increases, or augments, one says يَزْكُو, inf. n. زَكَا=ءٌ. (TA.) [This is the primary meaning: or, accord. to some, the primary meaning is, <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, pure:</i>] some say that the root denotes purity: and some, that it denotes a state of increase, or augmentation. (Mgh.) You say also زَكَتِ الاَرْضُ <br>\
                  <i>The land throve,</i> or <i>yielded increase.</i> (Msb.) And زَكَا الغُلَامُ [<i>The boy grew,</i> or <i>throve</i>], inf. n. زُكُوٌّ and زَكَا=ءٌ, on the authority of Akh. (S.) And زَكَا عَمَلُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>His deed,</i> or <i>work, throve</i>]. (K in art. در.) It is said in a trad. of &#39;Alee, المَالُ تَنْقُصُهُ النَّفَقَةُ وَالعِلْمُ يَزْكُو عَلَى <br>\
                  الاـِنْفَاقِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Wealth, what one expends diminishes it, but knowledge increases by expending</i>]: زَكَا=ء being thus predicated of knowledge, though this is not a corporeal thing. (TA.) Accord. to El-Umawee, (S,) said of a man, زَكَا, (S, K,) aor. يَزْكُو, inf. n. زُكُوٌّ, (S,) means <i>He enjoyed,</i> or <i>led, a plentiful, and a pleasant</i> or <i>an easy, and a soft</i> or <i>delicate, life;</i> (S, K;) <i>was in a state of abundance of the goods, conveniences,</i> or <i>comforts, of life.</i> (S.) And likewise said of a man, (having the same aor. and inf. n., TA,) it means also <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, good,</i> or <i>righteous;</i> (Jel in xxiv. 21, Msb, K, TA;) and <i>pure from sin.</i> (Jel ibid.) [Hence,] هٰذَا الاَمْرُ لَا يَزْكُو بِفُلَانٍ means <i>This thing,</i> or <i>affair, will not be suitable to such a one; will not befit him.</i> (S.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  زَكَّاهَا [<i>Verily he prospereth who purifieth it;</i> namely, his soul]: sometimes it is God; as in [the saying in the Kur xxiv. 21,] وَلٰكِنَّ اْللّٰهَ يُزَكِّى <br>\
                  مَنْ يَشَا=ءُ [<i>But God purifieth whom He willeth</i>]: and sometimes it is the Prophet; as in the saying [in the Kur ix. 104], خُذْ مِنْ اَمْوَالِهِمْ صَدَقَةً تُطَهِّرُهُمْ <br>\
                  وَتُزَكِّيهِمْ بِهَا [<i>Take thou, from their possessions, a poor-rate, whereby thou shalt cleanse them and purify them;</i> where (J says in the S) they say that تُزَكِّيهِمْ means the same as تُطَهِّرُهُمْ]; and in the saying [in the Kur ii. 146], يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ ا=يَاتِنَا <br>\
                  وَيُزَكِّيكُمْ [<i>Who reciteth to you our signs, and purifieth you</i>]. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―         -b3-  [Hence, accord. to what is said in the Kur ix. 104, i. e. because the act which it signifies is believed to purify the performer, or because it is believed to purify, or to occasion an increase of, the rest of his property,] زكّى مَالَهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. as above, (S, Msb,) <i>He gave the</i> <br>\

                  زَكَا=ء, i. e. [<i>purity,</i> or] <i>goodness,</i> or <i>righteousness.</i> (Msb.) [And hence, <i>I praised him.</i>] And زكّى <br>\
                  نَفْسَهُ, (S, Mgh,) inf. n. as above, (S,) <i>He praised himself.</i> (S, Mgh.) The doing this is forbidden in the Kur liii. 33. (Er-Rághib, TA.) Hence, also, تَزْكِيَةُ الشُّهُودِ <br>\
                  <i>The pronouncing the witnesses to be veracious,</i> and <i>good,</i> or <i>righteous.</i> (Mgh.)       -A2-  هُوَ يُخَسِّى وَيُزَكِّى <br>\
                  <i>He plays, and says,</i> “ <i>Is it even</i> or <i>odd</i> [or rather <i>odd or even</i>]?” (TA in art. خسو;) <i>he takes,</i> or <i>holds, something in his hand, and says,</i> “ <i>Is it even or odd</i> [or <i>odd or even</i>]?” (TA in the present art.)

      زَكَا=ءٌ [mentioned in the first paragraph as an inf. n.], (Msb,) <i>resulting from the blessing of God;</i> and this is [said to be] the primary meaning; and is considered as relating to the things of the present world and to those of the world to come.

      زَكَا=ءٌ [also] signifies. (Msb.) And <i>Religious service;</i> as being the means of purification: so [accord. to some] it signifies in the saying [in the Kur xix. 14], وَحَنَانًا مِنْ لَدُنَّا وَزَكٰوةً [<i>And</i> the disposition to <i>mercy,</i> or <i>compassion, from us, and religious service</i>]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or it here means طُهْرَة [i. e. <i>purification,</i> or <i>purity</i>]: and [accord. to some, if we except the instances mentioned above in the  next two preceding sentences,] this is the only instance in the Kur-án in which it is used in any other sense than that which next follows.

(Er-Rághib, TA.) زَكَاةُ الفِطْرِ [<i>The alms of the breaking of the fast,</i> given at the end of Ramadán,] is obligatory upon every person of the Muslims, the free and the slave, the male and the female, the young and the old, the poor and the rich; and purifies the faster from unprofitable and lewd discourse: it consists of a صَاع [q. v.] of dates, or of barley, [or of raisins or some other ordinary kind of food,] or half that quantity of wheat.
