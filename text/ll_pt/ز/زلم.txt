                  <i>An arrow without a head and without feathers:</i> pl. اَزْلَامٌ: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) which was applied to those [<i>divining-</i>] <i>arrows by means of which the Arabs in the Time of Ignorance sought to know what was allotted to them:</i> (S, K:) they were <i>arrows upon which the Arabs in the Time of Ignorance wrote</i> “ <i>Command</i> ” <i>and</i> “ <i>Prohibition;</i> ” (Mgh, Msb;) or <i>upon some of which was written</i> “ <i>My Lord hath commanded me;</i> ” <i>and upon some,</i> “ <i>My Lord hath forbidden me;</i> ” (Har p. 465;) or they were <i>three arrows; upon one of which was written</i> “ <i>My Lord hath commanded me;</i> ” <i>and upon another,</i> “ <i>My Lord hath forbidden me;</i> ” <i>and the third was blank;</i> (Bd in v. 4;) <i>and they put them in a receptacle,</i> (Mgh, Msb,) <i>and when any one of them desired to make a journey, or to accomplish a want,</i> (Mgh,) or <i>when he desired to perform some affair,</i> (Msb,) <i>he put his hand into that receptacle,</i> (Mgh, Msb,) <i>and took forth an arrow;</i> (Msb;) <i>and if the arrow upon which was</i> “ <i>Command</i> ” [or “ <i>My Lord hath commanded me</i> ” (Har ubi suprà)] <i>came forth, he went to accomplish his purpose; but if that upon which was</i> “ <i>Prohibition</i> ” [or “ <i>My Lord hath forbidden me</i> ” (Har)] <i>came forth, he refrained;</i> (Mgh, Msb;) <i>and if the blank came forth, they shuffled them a second time:</i> (Bd ubi suprà:) or, as some say, the ازلام were <i>white pebbles, upon which they thus wrote, and by means of which they sought to know what was allotted to them in the manner expl. above:</i> (Har ubi suprà:) or, accord. to Az, the ازلام [were <i>arrows that</i>] <i>belonged to Kureysh, in the Time of Ignorance, upon which were written</i> “ <i>He hath commanded</i> ” <i>and</i> “ <i>He hath forbidden,</i> ” <i>and</i> “ <i>Do thou</i> ” <i>and</i> “ <i>Do thou not;</i> ” <i>they had been well shaped</i> (زُلِّمَتْ) <i>and made even, and placed in the Kaabeh, the ministers of the House taking care of them; and when a man desired to go on a journey, or to marry, he came to the minister, and said,</i> “ <i>Take thou forth for me a</i> <br>\
                  زلم; ” <i>and thereupon he would take it forth, and look at it; and if the arrow of command came forth, he went to accomplish that which he had purposed to do; but if the arrow of prohibition came forth, he refrained from that which he desired to do:</i> [it is said that] <i>there were seven of the arrows thus called with the minister of the Kaabeh, having marks upon them, and used for this purpose:</i> (Jel in v. 4:) <i>and sometimes there were with the man two such arrows, which he put into his sword-case; and when he desired to seek the knowledge of what was allotted to him, he took forth one of them.</i> (TA.) Some say that the اَزْلَام are The <i>arrows of the game called</i> <br>\
                  المَيْسِر: but this is a mistake. (TA.) The seeking to obtain the knowledge of what is allotted to one by means of the ازلام is forbidden in the Kur v. 4.

(TA.) [Hence, likewise,] the former of the two words (زَلَمٌ) signifies also (assumed tropical:)  <i>A strong and light</i> or <i>active boy:</i> pl. as above: (TA:) [app. because] a poet likens [such] a boy to an arrow of the kind thus called.
