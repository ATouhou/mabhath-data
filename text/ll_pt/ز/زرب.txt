      وَيْلٌ لِلزَّرْبِيَّةِ, occurring in a trad., is said to mean (tropical:)  <i>Wo to those who go in to lords,</i> or <i>princes, and, when they say what is evil, or say anything, say, He has spoken truth:</i> such persons being likened, in respect of their variable conduct, to one of the زَرَابِىّ mentioned above in the first sentence of this paragraph; or to <i>sheep,</i> or <i>goats,</i> which are thus called in relation to the زَرْب, i. e. the enclosure to which they repair, because they are obsequious to the lords, or princes, and follow their steps with the submissiveness of sheep or goats to their pastor.

      زَرَابِىُّ is applied to plants, as meaning <i>Such as have become yellow,</i> or <i>red, while having in them greenness:</i> (K, TA:) and when they saw the colours in carpets and other articles of furniture that are spread, they likened them to such plants. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
