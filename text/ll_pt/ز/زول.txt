(TA.) ―         -b5-  زال [having for its inf. n., app., زَوَالٌ and زَوِيلٌ and زَوْلٌ (see the first of these below)] signifies also <i>It moved;</i> or <i>was,</i> or <i>became, in a state of motion, commotion,</i> or <i>agitation;</i> syn. تَحَرَّكَ: so in the saying, رَاَيْتُ شَبَحًا ثُمَّ زَالَ [<i>I saw a bodily form</i> or <i>figure: then it moved,</i> &amp;amp;c.].
