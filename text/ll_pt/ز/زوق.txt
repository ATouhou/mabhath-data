                  , (O, Msb, TA,) inf. n. تَزْوِيقٌ, (Msb, K,) [seems to signify primarily <i>He washed it over with</i> <br>\
                  زَاوُوق, i. e. <i>quicksilver; he silvered it therewith.</i>] One says, زوّق الدَّرَاهِمَ [<i>He washed over the dirhems with quicksilver</i>]; from الزَّاوُوقُ. (MA.) ―         -b2-  [Then, <i>He gilded it with an amalgam of quicksilver and gold:</i> see زَاوُوقٌ. ―         -b3-  And hence,] <i>He decorated it,</i> and <i>embellished it;</i> namely, a thing [of any kind: and particularly <i>he painted it</i>]: but IF says that زوّقهُ, meaning thus, is without foundation; that they say it is from الزَّوُوقُ meaning الزِيْبَقُ; [as it is said to be in the K;] but that this is [mere] assertion. (O, TA.) [Whether properly or improperly, however,] one says, زَوَّقَ البَيْتَ بِالزَّاوُوقِ, i. e. <i>He decorated the house,</i> or <i>chamber,</i> [perhaps meaning the House of God, at Mekkeh, i. e. the Kaabeh, as appears to be probable from what here follows,] <i>and changed its colour and its fashion</i> or <i>semblance, with</i> <br>\
                  زاووق, i. e. زيبق. (Har p. 107.) And it is related in a trad. that he [Mohammad] said to Ibn-&#39;Omar, اـِذَا رَاَيْتَ قُرَيْشًا قَدْ هَدَمُوا البَيْتَ ثُمَّ بَنَوْهُ <br>\
                  فَزَوَّقُوهُ فَاـِنِ اْسْتَطَعْتَ المَوْتَ فَمُتْ [<i>When thou seest Kureysh shall have demolished the House</i> of God, <i>then built it</i> again, <i>and decorated it, if thou be able to die, then die</i>]: he disliked the تَزْوِيق of mosques because of its inducing desire for the things of the present world, and its finery, or because of its diverting the person praying. (TA.) ―         -b4-  One says also, (TA,) زَوَّقْتُ الكَلَامَ, and الكِتَابَ, (assumed tropical:)  <i>I embellished the speech,</i> or <i>language,</i> and <i>the writing,</i> or <i>book;</i> and (tropical:)  <i>I rectified,</i> or <i>corrected, it.</i> (S, TA.) And زَوَّرَ فُلَانٌ كِتَابَهُ and زَوَّقَهُ both mean (tropical:)  <i>Such a one rectified,</i> or <i>corrected, his writing,</i> or <i>book.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  And زَوَّقُوا الجَارِيَةَ <br>\
                  <i>They embellished the girl,</i> or <i>young woman, with</i> <br>\
                  نُقُوش [or <i>decorations,</i> app. <i>such as are made by tattooing,</i> or <i>staining with</i> <br>\
                  حِنَّا=ء]: such decoration is termed ↓ <br>\
      زَوَاقٌ, like سَحَابٌ: and hence, ↓ <br>\
