                     <i>Q. 1</i>        <br>\
                     زَرْنَقَةٌ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                   [as inf. n. of زَرْنَقَ] The <i>irrigating</i> [land] <i>by means of the</i> <br>\
                  زُرْنُوق [here app. meaning <i>rivulet</i>]. (Mgh, K.) ―         -b2-  And The <i>setting up a</i> [<i>pillar-like structure such as is termed</i>] زُرْنُوق <br>\
                  <i>by a well.</i> (K.)       -A2-  One says also, زَرْنَقْتُهُ, (K,) inf. n. as above, (TK,) meaning <i>I clad him</i> [app. فِى <br>\
                  الثِّيَابِ <br>\
                  <i>in the clothes:</i> see Q. 2]: or زَرْنَقْتُ اللِّبَاسِ <br>\
                  اـِيَّاهُ <br>\
                  <i>I put the clothing upon him;</i> or <i>clad him therewith.</i> (TK)       -A3-  And لَا يُزَرْنِقُكَ اَحَدٌ عَلَى <br>\
                  فَضْلِ زَيْدٍ [<i>No one will exceed to thee the excel-lence of Zeyd</i>]. (TA. [It is there indicated that this is from زَرْنَقَةٌ as syn. with زِيَادَةٌ.])       -A4-  [See زَرْنَقَةٌ as a simple subst. below.]    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>تَزَرْنَقَ</b>               1     <br>\
                     <i>Q. 2</i>        <br>\
                     تَزَرْنَقَ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>He drew water by means of the</i> <br>\
                  زُرْنُوق, (Mgh, K, TA,) or <i>the</i> <br>\
                  زُرْنُوقَانِ, (TA,) <i>for hire.</i> (Mgh, K, TA.) Hence the saying of &#39;Alee, لَا اَدَعُ الحَجَّ وَلَوْ تَزَرْنَقْتُ, meaning <i>I will not omit,</i> or <i>neglect, the pilgrimage, though I should draw water by means of the</i> <br>\
                  زرنوق, or زرنوقان, <i>and perform it with the hire obtained thereby:</i> thus it is explained: another explanation will be found in what follows. (Mgh, TA.)       -A2-  تزرنق فِى الثِّيابِ <br>\
                  <i>He clad, and covered, himself in the clothes.</i> (K.) ―         -b2-  And hence, [it is said,] because implying concealment of the excess [of the price] in the sale, (TA,) تزرنق also signifies تَعَيَّنَ, (Mgh, K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously, تَغَيَّرَ,]) from الزَّرْنَقَةُ meaning العِينَةُ; (Mgh;) i. e. <i>He bought on credit, for an excess</i> [<i>in the amount of the price</i>]. (TK.) And accord. to some, وَلَوْ تَزَرْنَقْتُ, in the saying of &#39;Alee mentioned above, means وَلَوْ تَعَيَّنْتُ, (Mgh,) i. e. وَلَوْ تَعَيَّنْتُ عِينَةَ الزَّادِ وَالرَّاحِلَةِ [<i>though I should buy on credit, for more than the current price, the travelling-provision and the camel to be ridden</i>]: (TA:) but the former explanation is the more likely.

                  عِينَةٌ; (IAar, JK, Mgh, K;) i. e. The <i>buying of a thing from a man on credit, for more than its</i> [<i>current</i>] <i>price:</i> (JK, Fáïk:) or the <i>doing thus, and then selling it to him,</i> or <i>to another, for less than the price for which it was purchased.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  And <i>Increase, excess,</i> or <i>addition;</i> syn. زِيَادَةٌ. (K.) [For زَرْنَقَةٌ in this and the following senses, Freytag, in his Lex., has written زَرْنَق.] ―         -b3-  And <i>Debt.</i> (K, TA. [In the CK, الدِّينُ is erroneously put for الدَّيْنُ: and it is there added, “ as though arabicized from زَرْنَهْ; i. e. الذَّهَبَ لَبِسَ: ” but what this should be I know not, unless it be a mistranscription for الذَّهَبُ لَيْسَ; for, in Pers., زَرْ means “ gold, ” and نَهْ is a negative.])       -A3-  Also <i>Perfect,</i> or <i>consummate, beauty.</i> (K.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  , as some pronounce it, is by others pronounced زَرْنُوقٌ, which is of a strange form, [said to be] of the measure فَعْنُولٌ, (IJ, TA,) mentioned by Kr on the authority of Lh: (TA:) [the dual] زُرْنُوقَانِ, (S, Mgh, K,) mentioned by J in art. زرق, the ن being regarded by him as augmentative, but by the author of the K as radical, (TA,) also pronounced زَرْنُوقَانِ, (K,) signifies <i>Two pillarlike structures</i> (مَنَارَتَانِ) <i>constructed by the head of a well,</i> (S, Mgh, K,) <i>on the two sides thereof;</i> (K;) or <i>two walls;</i> or <i>two posts;</i> (Mgh;) <i>across which is placed a piece of wood,</i> (S, Mgh,) <i>called the</i> <br>\

(TA.) ―         -b2-  زُرْنُوقٌ also signifies <i>A rivulet;</i> (Sh, Mgh, K;) app. <i>a rivulet in which runs the water that is drawn by means of the</i> <br>\
