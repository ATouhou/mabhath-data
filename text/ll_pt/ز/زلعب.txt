Accord. to the S, and AHei, the ل is augmentative; [as it is said with equal reason to be in اِزْلَغَبَّ;] but accord. to the K, it is radical, and therefore this is its proper place, not art. زعب.

                  اِزْلَغَبَّ, [q. v.,] said of hair. (TA in art. زلغب.) ―         -b3-  And ازلعبّ السَّحَابُ <br>\
