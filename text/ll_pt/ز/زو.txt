                  , or زِىَّ, (accord. to different copies of the S, in the TA زُىَّ,) [from زَوٌّ, originally زُوِوَ, then زُوِىَ, and then زُىَّ or زِىَّ,] or it is زُوِىَ, (thus in some copies of the S,) <i>It was decreed against us.</i> (S.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  , (K,) said of a man, (TA,) [from زَوٌّ,] <i>He came having with him another:</i> (K, and T in art. تو:) mentioned by Az and Sgh on the authority of IAar: (TA:) opposed to اَتْوَى meaning “ he came alone; by himself. ” (T in art. تو.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                     زَوٌّ<br>\

                  <i>A pair,</i> or <i>couple; two coupled together;</i> (S, K, TA;) [of men, and] of ships and other things; (TA;) <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  زَوْجٌ: (K, and T in art. تو:) opposed to تَوٌّ meaning “ one, and no more. ” (K, and TA in this art. and in art. تو.) You say, جَا=ءَ فُلَانٌ زَوًّا, meaning <i>Such one came with his companion.</i> (S.) [See also art. تو.]       -A2-  الزَّوُّ is also the name of <i>A ship constructed by ElMutawekkil,</i> (K, TA,) <i>the &#39;Abbásee;</i> in which he associated in drinking with the poet El-Boh- turee. (TA.) Accord. to the S, it is the name of a mountain in El-&#39;Irák: but Aboo-Zekereeyà EtTebreezee, and after him the author of the K, deny this, and suppose J to have been led into error in asserting such to be the case by the following saying of the poet above mentioned: <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَلَا جَبَلًا كَالزَّوِّ يُوقَفُ تَارَةً<br>\

                        وَيَنْقَادُ اـِمَّا قُدْتَهُ بِزِمَامِ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>Nor</i> have I seen <i>a mountain like</i> <br>\
                  الزَّوّ, <i>that is made stationary at one time, and becomes led on</i> at another time <i>if thou draw it along with a leading-rope</i>]: J, however, does not say that he took this from the poetry of El-Bohturee. (TA. [In the CK, in the verse above cited, اِذْ ما is put in the place of اـِمَّا.])       -A3-  [J also says that,] accord. to As, زَوُّ المَنِيَّةِ signifies <i>What happens of decreed perdition</i> or <i>death:</i> and زَوٌّ is also said to signify <i>a decree</i> [of God]: (S, TA:) and in the M it is said that زَوٌّ signifies <i>perdition,</i> or <i>death:</i> and زَوُّ <br>\
                  المَنِيَّةِ, <i>the accidents,</i> or <i>calamities, of destiny</i> or <i>death:</i> but accord. to the T, As said زَوْءُ المَنِيَّةِ, withء (TA.)   </entryFree> <br>\
