                  , said of seed-produce, <i>It increased,</i> or <i>augmented; received increase and blessing from God;</i> or <i>throve by the blessing of God:</i> (JK, TA:) [or,] said of herbage, aor. يَزْهُو, inf. n. زَهْوٌ, <i>it attained its full growth:</i> (Msb:) or <i>it put forth its fruit:</i> or <i>it became tall:</i> (TA:) and, said of palm-trees, (نَخْلٌ, S, Msb, K, TA,) and likewise of plants, (TA,) aor. as above, (Msb, TA,) and so the inf. n., (S, Msb, TA,) <i>they became tall;</i> (K, TA;) <i>became tall and fullgrown;</i> or <i>became of their full height, and blossomed;</i> (TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      ازهى signifies the same: (K:) or both signify <i>they</i> (i. e. palm-trees) <i>showed redness,</i> and <i>yellowness, in their fruit;</i> (S, Msb;) the latter verb mentioned by AZ, but [it is said that] As did not know it: (S: [see, however, what follows:]) or, as some say, the former signifies <i>they put forth their fruit;</i> and ↓ the latter, as expl. next before: (Msb:) accord. to Abu-lKhattáb and Lth, one says of palm-trees (نَخْل) only يُزْهِى; not يَزْهُو: and As [is related to have] said, [contr. to what has been asserted of him above,] that when redness appears in [the fruit of] palm-trees, one says ازهى. (TA.) And زَهَا <br>\
                  التَّمْرُ, (JK,) or البُسْرُ; and ↓ <br>\
      ازهى; (Mgh, K;) and ↓ <br>\
      زهّى, (K,) inf. n. تَزْهِيَةٌ; (TA;) [<i>The dates,</i> or <i>dates beginning to ripen,</i>] <i>showed their goodness by redness,</i> and <i>yellowness:</i> (JK:) <i>became red,</i> and <i>yellow:</i> (Mgh:) <i>became coloured.</i> (K.) Hence the trad., نَهَى عَنْ بَيْعِ ثَمَرِ النَّخْلِ حَتَّى يَزْهُوَ, or ↓ <br>\
      يُزْهِىَ, [<i>He forbade the selling of the fruit of the palm-trees until its becoming red</i> or <i>yellow</i>], thus differently related. (Mgh.) ―         -b2-  You say also, زَهَا الغُلَامُ, (K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,) <i>The boy grew up;</i> or <i>attained to youthful vigour,</i> or <i>the prime of manhood.</i> (K.) ―         -b3-  And زَهَتِ <br>\
                  الشَّاةُ, (JK, S, K,) aor. as above, (S,) and so the inf. n., (JK, S,) <i>The ewe,</i> or <i>she-goat, became large in her udder:</i> (JK:) or <i>secreted milk in her udder, and was near to bringing forth.</i> (AZ, S, K. *) ―         -b4-  And زَهَتِ الرِّيحُ <br>\
                  <i>The wind rose, blew,</i> or <i>became in a state of commotion.</i> (S.) ―         -b5-  And زَهَتِ الاـِبِلُ, (JK, S, M, K,) aor. as above, (JK, M,) and so the inf. n., (S, M,) <i>The camels journeyed, after coming to water,</i> (JK, S, M, K,) <i>a night</i> or <i>more,</i> (JK, S, M,) so says A&#39;Obeyd, (S,) or <i>a night</i> or <i>two nights.</i> (K.) And <i>The camels passed along,</i> (مَرَّت,) so in the copies of the K, but correctly مَدَّت [i. e. <i>made much advance in journeying</i>], as in the M, (TA,) <i>in search of pasturage, after they had drunk,</i> (K, TA,) <i>not pasturing around the water.</i> (TA.) The verb used in relation to camels is also trans., as will be shown below. (S, &amp;amp;c.)       -A2-  زَهْوٌ [as inf. n. of the trans. v. زَهَا, aor. يَزْهَى,] primarily signifies The act of <i>raising,</i> or <i>elevating:</i> and the act of <i>shaking;</i> or <i>putting in motion,</i> or <i>into a state of commotion:</i> whence زَهَاهُ السَّرَابُ and زَهَتِ الرِّيحُ النَّبَاتَ [both expl. in what follows]. (Har p. 171.) You say, زَهَتِ الاَمْوَاجُ السَّفِينَةَ <br>\
                  <i>The waves raised the ship.</i> (TA.) And زَهَا السَّرَابُ الشَّىْءَ, aor. يَزْهَاهُ, <i>The mirage raised,</i> or <i>elevated,</i> [<i>to the eye,</i>] <i>the thing</i> [seen in it or beyond it; or rather, <i>made it to appear tall, and as though quivering, vibrating,</i> or <i>playing up and down;</i> as is perhaps meant to be indicated by the citation above from Har]; syn. رَفَعَهُ; written only [thus] with ا [in the pret. and in the aor.]: (S:) and السَّرَابُ يَزْهَى القُبُورَ <br>\
                  وَالحُمُولَ <br>\
                  <i>The mirage is as though it raised the tombs and the women&#39;s camel-vehicles;</i> or <i>elevated them;</i> expl. by the words كَاَنَّهُ يَرْفَعُهَا. (TA.) ―         -b2-  And زَهَا المِرْوَحَةَ, said of a person fanning, <i>He put in motion the fan;</i> or <i>put it into a state of commotion;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      زَهَّاهَا. (TA.) And زَهَتِ <br>\
                  الرِيحُ الشَّجَرَ, (S,) or النَّبَاتَ, (K, * TA,) aor. تَزْهَاهُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. زَهْوٌ, (K, TA,) <i>The wind shook,</i> or <i>put in motion</i> or <i>into a state of commotion,</i> (S, K, * TA,) <i>the trees,</i> (S,) or <i>the plants,</i> or <i>herbage, after the dew</i> or <i>rain</i> (غِبَّ النَّدَى). (K, TA.) ―         -b3-  And زَهَاهُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. زَهْوٌ; (K, TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      ازدهاهُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. اِزْدِهَا=ءٌ; (K, TA;) [not ازهاهُ, as in the TK, followed by Freytag;] <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  اِسْتَخَفَّهُ: (S, K, * TA:) and تَهَاوَنَ بِهِ: (S:) [the former of these two explanations as meaning <i>He,</i> or <i>it, incited him,</i> or <i>excited him, to briskness, liveliness,</i> or <i>sprightliness;</i> or <i>to lightness, levity,</i> or <i>unsteadiness:</i> and the latter of them, or both of them, for the former is often syn. with the latter, as meaning <i>he held him,</i> or <i>it, in little,</i> or <i>light, estimation</i> or <i>account,</i> or <i>in contempt; he contemned,</i> or <i>despised, him,</i> or <i>it:</i> but of this latter meaning I do not remember to have met with any ex.:] and بِهِ ↓ <br>\
      ازدهى signifies the same as ازدهاه (TA) meaning تَهَاوَنَ بِهِ. (JK.) You say, زَهَاهُ الشَّىْءُ and ↓ <br>\
      ازدهاهُ, meaning [agreeably with the former of the two explanations in the sentence immediately preceding] اِسْتَخَفَّهُ طَرَبًا: (Har p. 359:) and ↓ <br>\
      يَزْدَهِينِى as meaning [agreeably with the same explanation] يَسْتَفِزُّنِى and يَسْتَخِفُّنِى: (Id. p. 131:) and القَوْمَ ↓ <br>\
      ازدهى as meaning [in like manner] اِسْتَخَفَّهُمْ مِنَ الطَّرَبِ; and also as meaning <i>He pleased the people,</i> or <i>party:</i> (Id. p. 427:) and ↓ <br>\
      اِزْدَهَاهُ also as meaning حَمَلَهُ عَلَى الزَّهْوِ [<i>He incited him,</i> or <i>excited him, to pride,</i> or <i>conceit,</i> or <i>the like</i>]: (Id. p. 131:) and زَهَاهُ الكِبْرُ (K) <i>Pride rendered him self-conceited.</i> (TK.) &#39;Omar Ibn-&#39;Abee-Rabeea says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَلَمَّا تَقَاوَضْنَا الحَدِيثَ وَاَسْفَرَتْ<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وُجُوهٌ زَهَاهَا الحُسْنُ اَنْ تَتَقَنَّعَا<br>\
                  </quote> meaning <i>And when we discoursed together, and faces shone, beauty excited</i> the possessors of <i>them to levity</i> (اِسْتَخَفَّ اَرْبَابَهَا) <i>and prevented their veiling them with the</i> <br>\
                  قِنَاع [or <i>head-covering</i>], by reason of self-admiration: or, as some say, the ها in زهاها refers to a woman mentioned before, not to وجوه; and the meaning is, <i>beauty excited her</i> &amp;amp;c.: and thus the women of the Arabs used to do when they were beautiful: or you may consider the complement of لَمَّا as suppressed; as though he said, when we did all that, we behaved with mutual familiarity, or the like; for the complements of لَوْ and لَمَّا and حِينَ may be suppressed, and their vagueness by reason of their suppression is more forcible in respect of the meaning: اَنْ تَتَقَنَّعَا means مِنْ اَنْ تَتَقَنَّعَا; for they often suppress the preposition with اَنْ: (Ham pp. 552-3:) [J gives two readings of this verse, accord to one of my copies of the S: one is with تَنَازَعَا in the place of تَقَاوَضْنَا, and اَشْرَقَتْ in the place of اَسْفَرَتْ; which make no difference in the meaning: but this is omitted in my other copy: the other is as follows:] <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        فَلَمَّا تَوَافَقْنَا سَلَّمْتُ اَقْبَلَتْ<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وُجُوهٌ زَهَاهَا الحُسْنُ اَنْ تَتَقَنَّعَا<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>And when we agreed together, and I saluted, faces advanced, which beauty excited</i> &amp;amp;c, or the possessors of which <i>beauty excited</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (S.) And hence their saying, بِخَدِيعَةٍ ↓ <br>\
      فُلَانٌ لَا يُزْدَهَى [<i>Such a one will not be incited,</i> or <i>excited, to briskness,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>by means of deceit,</i> or <i>guile</i>]. (S.) And الفَرَحُ ↓ <br>\
      ازدهاهُ, meaning اِسْتَخَفَّهُ [<i>Joy incited him,</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (MA.) [And hence, perhaps, may be derived most of the following significations.] ―         -b4-  زَهَا الطَّلُّ النَوْرَ <br>\
                  <i>The</i> <br>\
                  طلّ [or <i>fine drizzling rain</i>] <i>made the flowers,</i> or <i>blossoms, to increase in beauty of aspect.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  زَهَا السِّرَاجَ, (K,) aor. يزهوهُ [perhaps a mistranscription for يَزْهَاهُ], inf. n. زَهْوٌ, (TA,) <i>He made the</i> <br>\
                  سراج [or <i>lamp,</i> or <i>lighted wick,</i>] <i>to give a bright light.</i> (K.) ―         -b6-  زَهَوْتُ الاـِبِلَ <br>\
                  <i>I made the camels to journey, after coming to water,</i> (A &#39;Obeyd, JK, S, K,) <i>a night</i> or <i>more,</i> (A &#39;Obeyd, JK, S,) or <i>a night</i> or <i>two nights.</i> (K.) Thus the verb in relation to camels is trans. as well as intrans. (S.) ―         -b7-  زَهَا بِالسَّيْفُ <br>\
                  <i>He made a sign with the sword by waving it,</i> or <i>brandishing it.</i> (K, TA.) ―         -b8-  زَهَا بِالعَصَا <br>\
                  <i>He struck with the staff,</i> or <i>stick.</i> (K.) ―         -b9-  زَهَا بِمِايَةِ رِطْلٍ <br>\
                  <i>He computed,</i> or <i>computed by conjecture,</i> [<i>to be of the weight of</i>] <i>a hundred pounds.</i> (K.) You say, زَهَاهُ بِمِايَةِ رِطْلٍ meaning خرزه [a mistake for حَزَرَهُ i. e. <i>He computed it,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>to be of the weight of a hundred pounds</i>]. (TK. In the TA, زها فلان <br>\
                  بماية رطل, [الشَّىْءَ or the like being omitted by an oversight,] aor. يَزْهَاهُ [which indicates an omission after فلان].) And زَهَوْتُ القَوْمَ <br>\
                  <i>I computed,</i> or <i>computed by conjecture, the number of the people,</i> or <i>party.</i> (JK.)       -A3-  زُهِىَ, (JK, S, K,) like عُنِىَ; (S, K;) and زَهَا, (IDrd, S, K,) like دَعَا, but this is rare, (K,) and was dissallowed by As in the sense of زُهِىَ, (TA in art. نخو,) aor. يَزْهُو, inf. n. زَهْوٌ; (IDrd, S;) and ↓ <br>\
      اَزْهَى; (K;) said of a man, (JK, S,) <i>He behaved proudly, haughtily,</i> or <i>insolently;</i> (S, K, * TA;) <i>he was proud, vain,</i> and <i>boastful;</i> (K;) or <i>was pleased with himself,</i> or <i>self-conceited:</i> (JK:) ازدهى [i. e. ↓ <br>\
      اُزْدُهِىَ], in like manner, means تَكَبَّرَ: (Har p. 264: [but this more properly signifies, as shown above by an explanation of اِزْدَهَاهُ, <i>he was incited,</i> or <i>excited, to lightness, levity,</i> or <i>unsteadiness:</i>]) the first of these verbs [may be originally pass. of زَهَا in the phrase زَهَاهُ الكِبْرُ, mentioned before, but, as J says,] is one of a class of verbs used in the pass. form though having the sense of the act. form: in using it imperatively, you say, لِتُزْهَ يَا رَجُلُ [<i>Behave thou proudly,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>O man;</i> see art. ت]; and like this is the aor. [used as an imperative] of every verb of which the agent is not named; for when it is reduced to its essential import, you thereby command something, other than the person whom you address, to affect, or befall, that person; and the third person of the [aor. used as an] imperative is never without ل, as when you say, لِيَقُمْ زَيْدٌ: (S, TA:) J also says, (TA,) I said to an Arab of the desert, of [the tribe of] Benoo-Suleym, What is the meaning of زُهِىَ الرَّجُلُ? and he answered, <i>The man was pleased with himself,</i> or <i>self-conceited:</i> I said, Dost thou say, زَهَا as meaning اِفْتَخَرَ [<i>He gloried,</i> or <i>boasted,</i> &amp;amp;c.]? and he answered, As for us, we do not say it. (S, TA.) One says also, زُهِىَ فُلَانٌ <br>\
                  بِكَذَا i. e. نُخِىَ [<i>Such a one gloried,</i> or <i>boasted,</i> and <i>magnified himself,</i> or <i>behaved proudly, by reason of such a thing</i>]; as though meaning زَهَاهُ <br>\
                  الاـِعْجَابُ بِنَفْسِهِ [i. e. <i>self-conceit elevated him</i> by reason of such a thing]. (Har p. 171.) ―         -b2-  And one says, زُهِىَ الشَّىْءُ بِعَيْنَيْكَ or لِعَيْنَيْكَ <br>\
                  <i>The thing was beautiful in aspect in,</i> or <i>to, thine eyes.</i> (S, accord. to different copies. [The meaning is there shown by what immediately precedes. In three copies of the S, I find the verb in this phrase thus written, زُهِىَ; and only in the PS, زها, for زَهَا, which is the form given by Golius: Freytag writes the phrase زَهَى الشى بعينك.])    </entryFree> <br>\

You say, قَالَ زَهْوًا [<i>He said a false,</i> or <i>vain, saying,</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (Ham ubi suprà.) ―         -b4-  <i>A beautiful aspect.</i> (S, K.) ―         -b5-  The <i>blossoms,</i> or <i>flowers, of a plant.</i> (Lth, K.) ―         -b6-  The <i>brightness of a plant</i> (K, TA) <i>by its becoming red or yellow;</i> (TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
