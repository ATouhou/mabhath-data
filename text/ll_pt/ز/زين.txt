      زَيْنٌ, also, [which see above,] signifies the same as زِينَةٌ: (Har p. 139:) accord. to El- Harállee, زِينَةٌ denotes the [<i>means of</i>] <i>beautifying,</i> or <i>embellishing, a thing by another thing; consisting of apparel,</i> or <i>an ornament of gold</i> or <i>silver</i> or <i>of jewels</i> or <i>gems,</i> or <i>aspect:</i> or, as some say, it is the <i>beauty</i> [<i>seen</i>] <i>of the eye that does not reach to the interior of that which is adorned</i> [<i>thereby</i>]: accord. to Er-Rághib, its proper mean-  ing is <i>a thing that does not disgrace,</i> or <i>render unseemly, a man, in any of his states</i> or <i>conditions, either in the present world or in that which is to come:</i> but that which adorns him in one state or condition, exclusively of another, is in one point of view شَيْنٌ: summarily speaking, it is of three kinds; namely, <i>mental, such as knowledge</i> or <i>science, and good tenets;</i> and <i>bodily, such as strength, and tallness of stature, and beauty of aspect;</i> and <i>extrinsic, such as wealth, and rank</i> or <i>station</i> or <i>dignity;</i> and all these are mentioned in the Kur: (TA:) the pl. is زِيَنٌ.
