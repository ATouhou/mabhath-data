      زَبَّرَ, meaning <i>he wrote,</i> though I know not the verb with teshdeed, or it is a simple subst. like تَوْدِيَةٌ: (TA:) thus زَبَرَ is <i>syn. with</i> <br>\

                  كَلَامٌ [as meaning The act of <i>speaking,</i> or <i>speech</i> as a subst.]: (K:) [SM says,] thus it is found in all the copies: but [he adds] I have not found any authoritative ex. of it, so it requires consideration. (TA.) [Accord. to the TK, however, one says, سَاَلْتُهُ فَمَا زَبَرَ لِى بِزَبْرٍ, meaning <i>I asked him, and he spoke not to me a speech,</i> or <i>sentence</i>]       -A3-  Accord. to the K, زَبْرٌ is also <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  صَبْرٌ [meaning The <i>being patient,</i> or <i>patience</i>]: one says, مَا لَهُ زَبْرٌ وَلَاصَبْرٌ: ISd says, This is mentioned by IAar; but in my opinion, the meaning here is عَقْلٌ. (TA. [See زَبْرٌ below.]) [Or, as syn. with صَبْرٌ, it may be an inf. n.: for, accord. to the TK, one says, لم يزبر عليه, meaning <i>He did not endure it with patience</i> (لَمْ يَصْبِرْ).]       -A4-  زَبُرَ, inf. n. زَبَارَةٌ, <i>He</i> (a ram) <i>was,</i> or <i>became, bulky.</i> (Lth, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>A piece of iron:</i> (S, Msb, K:) or <i>a big piece of iron:</i> (TA:) pl. زُبَرٌ (S, Msb, K) and زُبُرٌ. (S, K.) The former pl. occurs in the Kur xviii. 95. (S.) It is also said in the Kur [xxiii. 55], فَتَقَطَّعُوا اَمْرَهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ زُبُرًا, (S, TA,) and زُبَرًا; (TA;) meaning قِطَعًا, (S, TA,) in both cases; (Fr;) [i.e., <i>But they have become divided, in their state, among themselves, into parties:</i>] or he who reads زُبُرًا makes it pl. of ↓ <br>\
      زَبُورٌ, not of زُبْرَةٌ; for the measure فُعْلَةٌ does not assume the measure فُعُلٌ in the pl.; and the meaning is, <i>they have made their religion</i> [to be founded upon] <i>various books:</i> and زُبَرٌ is pl. of زُبْرَةٌ: or it may be also pl. of ↓ <br>\
      زَبُورٌ, and originally زُبُرٌ, being changed therefrom, like as some of the Arabs are related to have said جُدَدٌ for the pl. of جَدِيدٌ, which is originally and regularly جُدُدٌ; after the same manner as when one says رُكَبَاتٌ for رُكُبَاتٌ, and غُرَفَاتٌ for غُرُفَاتٌ: and this opinion is strengthened by AA&#39;s allowing the reading زُبُرًا and زُبْرًا and زُبَرًا; زُبْرًا being a contraction of زُبُرًا, like as عُنْقٌ is of عُنُقٌ.
