                  , (Msb, MS, JM, [not mentioned in the S nor in the K, app. because well known,]) inf. n. زَعْمٌ and زُعْمٌ and زعْمٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the first of the dial. of El-Hijáz, (Msb, TA,) the second of the dial. of [the tribe of] Asad, (Msb,) or Benoo-Temeem, (TA,) and the third of the dial. of some of [the tribe of] Keys; (Msb;) [generally best rendered <i>He asserted;</i> for it mostly relates to a thing not certainly known: or] <i>he said;</i> (S, Msb, K;) as in the phrases زَعَمَتِ <br>\
                  الحَنَفِيَّةٌ [<i>The Hanafees said</i> or <i>asserted,</i> or <i>have said</i> or <i>asserted,</i>] and زَعَمَ سِيبَوَيْهِ [<i>Seebaweyh said</i> or <i>asserted,</i> or <i>has said</i> or <i>asserted</i>]; (Msb;) [and زَعَمَ اَنَّهُ كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>He said,</i> or <i>asserted, that it was thus;</i>] either truly or falsely: (K:) mostly used in relation to a thing respecting which there is doubt, (Sh, Az, Msb, K,) and which is not certainly known: (Sh, Az, Msb:) or it is mostly used in relation to that which is false, or that respecting which there is doubt, or suspicion: (El-Marzookee, Msb:) or, as those skilled in the language of the Arabs say, in relation to a thing of which the speaker doubts, and does not know whether it may not be false: (Lth:) or زَعَمَ زَعْمًا means <i>he related a piece of information not knowing whether it were true or false.</i> (IKoot, Msb.) Hence the saying, زَعَمَ مَطِيَّةُ الكَذِبِ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  زَعَمَ <br>\
                  <i>is the conveyer,</i> or <i>vehicle,</i> (properly <i>the camel,</i> or <i>beast, that serves as the conveyer,</i>) <i>of lying</i>]. (Msb.) It is said in a trad., بِيْسَ مَطِيَّةُ الرَّجُلِ زَعَمُوا [(assumed tropical:)  <i>Very evil,</i> or <i>bad, is the man&#39;s conveyer</i> <br>\
                  زَعَمُوا]: i. e., when a man desires to journey to a country, or town, he mounts his camel, or beast, that serves to convey him, and journeys until he accomplishes the object of his want: therefore, that with which the speaker prefaces his speech, and by means of which he attains the object of his desire, when he says زَعَمُوا كَذَا وَكَذَا, is likened to the camel, or beast, by means of which he attains the object of want: for زَعَمُوا is [generally] said only in the case of a narration that has no authority whereon to rest, and that contains no proof. (TA.) IKh says that الزَّعْمُ is used in relation to that which is discommended; and that its primary signification is said by some of the expositors of the Kur-án to be The act of <i>lying:</i> (TA: [this signification is also given in the K, as being contr. to the first:]) some say that it is metonymically used in this sense: (Msb:) and it is expl. as having this meaning in the Kur [vi. 137], where it is said, فَقَالُوا هٰذَا لِلّٰهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ, i. e. [<i>And they have said,</i> “ <i>This</i> belongeth <i>unto God,</i> ”] <i>with their lying.</i> (Lth, TA.) ―         -b2-  [Sometimes] زَعَمَهُ signifies <i>He described him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (Har p. 204.) ―         -b3-  And sometimes زَعَمَ signifies <i>He promised:</i> whence the saying of &#39; Amr Ibn-Sha-s, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        تَقُولُ هَلَكْنَا اـِنْ هَلَكْتَ وَاـِنَّمَا<br>\

(TA.) ―         -b4-  الزَّعْمُ is used also in the sense of الظَّنُّ: (Msb, TA:) one says, فِى زَعْمِى كَذَا [<i>In my opinion</i> it is <i>thus</i>]. (Msb.) [Hence, likewise,] زَعَمْتَنِى <br>\
                  كَذَا, (K,) aor. تَزْعُمُنِى, (TA,) <i>Thou thoughtest me to be thus.</i> (K, TA.) Aboo-Dhu-eyb says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\

(TA. [The meaning of تزعمينى is there indicated by the context.]) ―         -b5-  It is also used in the sense of الاِعْتِقَادُ: whence the saying in the Kur [lxiv. 7], زَعَمَ اْلَّذِينَ كَفَرُو اَنْ <br>\
                  لَنْ يُبْعَثُوا [<i>They who have disbelieved</i> our revelations <i>have believed,</i> or <i>firmly believed, that they shall not be raised from the dead</i>]. (Msb.) ―         -b6-  Sometimes, also, زَعَمَ is used in the sense of شَهِدَ: as in the saying of En-Nábighah, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
