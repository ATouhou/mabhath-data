                  اْللّٰهُ لَنَا ظِلَّكَ is a deprecatory phrase [lit. <i>May God not cause thy shadow to become sun to us:</i> meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>may God not deprive us of thee by death:</i> (see ضَحَا ظِلُّهُ:) or it may be similar in meaning to the phrase here following]. (TA.) لَا تُضْحِنَا <br>\
                  عَنْ ظِلِّكَ [lit. <i>Make us not to go forth into the sun from thy shadow</i>] means (assumed tropical:)  <i>withdraw not from us the shadow of thy compassion:</i> the verb being made trans. by means of عن because the phrase implies the meaning of لَا تُخْرِجْنَا مِنْهُ: and ظلّ being here used metaphorically.
