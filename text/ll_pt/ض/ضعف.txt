      يُضَعَّفْ, (TA,) accord. to AO, (Mgh, O,) means, <i>The punishment shall be made to her three punishments;</i> (Mgh, O, K;) for, he says, she is to be punished once; and when the punishment is doubled twofold, [or is repeated twice,] the one becomes three: (TA:) he adds, (O,) and the tropical meaning of يُضَاعَفْ (مَجَازُ يُضَاعَفْ [for which مَجازٌ يُضَاعَفُ is erroneously put in the CK]) is two things&#39; being added to a thing so that it becomes three: (O, K:) but Az disapproves this, saying that it is peculiar to the tropical and the common conventional speech, whereas the skilled grammarians state the meaning to be, <i>she shall be punished with twice the like of the punishment of another;</i> (Mgh;) [so that it may be rendered <i>the punishment shall be doubled to her,</i> made <i>two-fold;</i> and in like manner] Ibn-&#39;Arafeh explains it as meaning <i>she shall have two shares of punishment.</i> (O.) فَيُضَاعِفُهُ لَهُ اَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً [<i>And He will multiply it to him many-fold,</i> or, as some read, فَيُضَاعِفَهُ <br>\

(TA.) ―         -b2-  ضَعْفُ التَّاْلِيفِ [<i>Weakness of construction, in language,</i>] is <i>such a construction of the members of a sentence as is contrary to the</i> [<i>generally approved</i>] <i>rules of syntax;</i> as when a pronoun is introduced before its noun with respect to the actual order of the words and the order of the sense [in a case in which the pronoun is affixed to the agent in a verbal proposition]; for instance, in the phrase, ضَرَبَ غُلَامُهُ <br>\
                  زَيْدًا [“ His, ” i. e. Zeyd&#39;s, “ young man beat Zeyd ”]. (KT.) When the pronoun is affixed to the objective complement, as in خَافَ رَبَّهُ عُمَرُ [“ &#39;Omar feared his Lord ”] such introduction of it is common: (I&#39;Ak p. 128:) and it is [universally] allowable when the pronoun is of the kind called ضَمِيرُ الشَّاْنِ, as in اـِنَّهُ زَيْدٌ قَايِمٌ; or ضَمِيرُ رُبَّ, as in رُبَّهُ رَجُلًا لَقِيتُهُ; or ضَمِيرُ نِعْمَ, as in نِعْمَهُ رَجُلًا زَيْدٌ.

                   signifies <i>The like of the thing,</i> (AO, Zj, S, O, Msb, K, TA,) <i>that doubles it</i> (يُضْعِفُهُ); (Zj, TA;) and ضِعْفَاهُ, <i>twice the like of it;</i> (AO, S, O, Msb, K;) and اَضْعَافُهُ, <i>the likes of it:</i> (S, Msb:) الضِّعْفُ in the [proper] language of the Arabs means <i>the like:</i> this is the original signification: (Az, Msb:) and (K, TA, but in CK “ or, ”) then, by a later [and conventional] usage, (Az, Msb,) <i>the like and more, the addition being unlimited:</i> (Az, Msb, K:) one says, هٰذَا <br>\
                  ضِعْفُ هٰذَا i. e. <i>This is the like of this:</i> and هٰذَانِ <br>\
                  ضِعْفَاهُ i. e. <i>These two are twice the like of it:</i> and it is allowable in the language of the Arabs to say, هٰذَا ضِعْفُهُ meaning <i>This is twice the like</i> [i. e. <i>the double</i>] <i>of it,</i> and <i>thrice the like</i> [i. e. <i>the treble</i>] <i>of it,</i> [and <i>more,</i>] because the ضِعْف is an unlimited addition: (Az, Msb: [and the like is said in the O, on the authority of Az:]) and one says, لَكَ ضِعْفُهُ meaning <i>Thou shalt have twice the like of it,</i> (Zj, O, K,) using the sing. form, though the dual form is better, (Zj, O,) and meaning also <i>thrice the like of it,</i> and <i>more without limit:</i> (K:) and الاِثْنَانِ ضِعْفُ الوَاحِدِ [i. e. الاثنان <br>\

(O.) In the saying, فَاُولَايِكَ لَهُمْ جَزَا=ءُ اْلضِّعْفِ <br>\
                  بِمَا عَمِلُوا, in the Kur [xxxiv. 36], by الضِّعْفِ is meant الاضْعَافِ [i. e. <i>For these shall be the recompense of the likes for what they have done</i>]; and it is most properly held to denote ten of the likes thereof, because of the saying in the Kur [vi. 161], “ Whoso doth that which is good, for him shall be ten of the likes thereof. ” (O.) In the saying, فَا=تِهِمْ عَذَابًا ضِعْفًا, in the Kur [vii. 36], by ضِعْفًا is meant مُضَاعَفًا [i. e. <i>Therefore do Thou recompense them with a doubled,</i> or <i>a double, punishment</i>]: عَذَابٌ ضِعْفٌ meaning <i>a punishment as though doubled, one part of it upon another.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  اَضْعَافُ الكِتَابِ means (tropical:)  <i>The interspaces of the lines,</i> (S, O, K, TA,) or <i>of the margin,</i> (S, O,) or and <i>of the margins,</i> (K, TA,) <i>of the writing,</i> or <i>book:</i> (S, O, K, TA:) so in the saying, وَقَّعَ <br>\
