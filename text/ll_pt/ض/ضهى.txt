                  عَذَابًا يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ الَّذِين يُضَاهُونَ خَلْقَ اْللّٰهِ i. e.

                   A woman <i>that does not menstruate:</i> pl. ضُهْىٌ; which necessarily implies that the former is [as above, i. e.] with the long ا: but AA mentions ↓ <br>\
      ضَهْيَاةٌ and ↓ <br>\
      ضَهْيَاهٌ, with ة and with ه, as having this meaning; which necessarily implies that ضهيا is with the short ا [i. e., accord. to a general rule, ↓ <br>\
      ضَهْيًا, with tenween, like ضَهْيَاٌ, q. v. in art. ضهيا, though (accord. to a general rule) this should be regarded as a masc. epithet]: (S) or ضَهْيَا=ءُ, and also with the short ا [app. ↓ <br>\
      ضَهْيًا, as above, not ضَهْيَا, or, as I rather incline to think, ضَهْيَاٌ (which is mentioned in art. ضهيا) may be here meant], signify a woman <i>that does not menstruate nor become pregnant;</i> (K, TA;) so that she is as though she resembled a man: (TA: [see 3:]) or <i>that menstruates but does not become pregnant:</i> (K, TA:) or <i>that does not bring forth, though she menstruate:</i> (TA:) or <i>whose breasts do not grow forth;</i> (K, TA;) and when this is the case, she does not menstruate: or the former signifies <i>that does not menstruate, being pregnant.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  Land <i>that does not give growth to anything;</i> as also with the short ا [i. e. ↓ <br>\
      ضَهْيًا or ضَهْيَاٌ]. (K. [In the TA this meaning is restricted, app. without reason, to the form with the short ا.])       -A2-  Also, (S, K,) and with the short ا [i. e. ↓ <br>\
