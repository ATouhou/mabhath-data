                   is from الضَّلَاعَةُ [inf. n. of ضَلُعَ]: so in the saying, فُلَانٌ مُضْطَلِعٌ بِهٰذَا الاَمْرِ i. e. <i>Such a one is possessed of strength,</i> or <i>power, sufficient for this affair:</i> so says ISk: and he adds that one should not say مُطَّلِعٌ: Aboo-Nasr Ahmad Ibn- Hátim says, one says هُوَ مُضْطَلِعٌ بِهٰذَا الاَمْرِ and مُطَّلِعٌ له [also]; الاِضْطِلَاعُ being from الضَّلَاعَةُ meaning القُوَّةُ; and الاِطِّلَاعُ being from العُلُوُّ, from the saying اِطَّلَعْتُ الثَّنِيَّةَ meaning عَلَوْتُهَا [I ascended upon the mountain, or mountain-road, termed ثَنِيَّة]; i. e. <i>he is one who has ascendancy with respect to this affair, who is master of it:</i> (S, O, TA:) Lth expressly allows مُطَّلِعٌ for مُضْطَلِعٌ by the incorporation of the ض into the [letter that is originally] ت, so that the two together become ط with teshdeed.

      هُوَ مُضْلِعٌ means the same as مُضْطَلِعٌ as first expl. above, i. e. <i>He is possessed of strength,</i> or <i>power, sufficient for this affair.</i> (O, K. [In both, in this instance, لِهٰذَا, not بِهٰذَا.]) In the phrase اـِذَا كَانَ مُضْطَلِعًا عَلَى حَقِّهِ [<i>If he be possessed of power,</i> or <i>ability, to obtain his right,</i> or <i>due</i>], it seems that مضطلعا is made trans. by means of على because made to imply the meaning of قَادِرًا or مُقْتَدِرًا.
