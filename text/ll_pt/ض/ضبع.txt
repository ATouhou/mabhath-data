[or rather the coll. gen. n.] is ضَبُعٌ; (O, K;) or ضَبَعَةٌ is not allowable: (S, K:) the pl. of ضَبُعٌ or ضَبْعٌ is اَضْبُعٌ, (K,) a pl. of pauc., (TA,) and ضِبَاعٌ, (K,) or the former is pl. of ضَبْعٌ, (Msb,) and the latter is pl. of ضَبُعٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) and is of the <i>male</i> and of the <i>female,</i> (S, K,) and ضُبُعٌ, (K,) as though this were pl. of ضِبَاعٌ, (AAF, TA,) and ضُبعٌ [a contraction of ضُبُعٌ] (K) and ضُبُعَاتٌ and ضُبُوعَةٌ (TA [in which it is indicated that this last is pl. of ضَبْعٌ]) and [quasi-pl. n.] ↓ <br>\

                  <i>from its den;</i> (O, K; in the CK, جارٌّ الصَّبُعَ;) hence meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>a torrent produced by vehement rain.</i> (TA.) And دَلْجَةُ الضَّبُعِ [<i>The night-journeying of the hyena</i>]; because the ضَبُع goes round about until midnight. (O, K.) And مَا يَخْفَى ذٰلِكَ عَلَى الضَّبُعِ [<i>That is not unapparent to the hyena</i>]: because the ضَبُع is deemed stupid. (TA.) اَحْمَقُ مِنَ الضَّبُعِ [<i>More stupid than the hyena</i>] is a prov. (Meyd.) And اَكَلَتْهُمُ الضَّبُعُ (tropical:)  [<i>The hyena devoured them</i>] is said of such as are held in mean estimation. (TA.)

                  </quote> [<i>My sheep,</i> or <i>goats, dispersed themselves, one day, and I said in relation to them, O my Lord, set upon them the wolf and the hyena</i>], is said to mean an imprecation, that the wolf might kill the living of them, and the hyena devour the dead of them: or, as some say, it means that the speaker prayed for their safety; because, when both fall upon the sheep, or goats, each of them is diverted from the sheep, or goats, by the other; and thus means the saying, اَللّٰهُمَّ ضَبُعًا وَذِيْبًا [<i>O God,</i> send <i>a hyena and a wolf</i>]: but the more probable meaning of the poet is an imprecation, the consequence of his anger and fatigue; and the word سَلِّطْ imports a notification of this meaning.
