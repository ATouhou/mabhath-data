                     ضَرِبَ<br>\
                  , (S, O, K, &amp;amp;c.,) inf. n. ضَرْبٌ, (S, O, &amp;amp;c.,) [<i>He beat, struck, smote,</i> or <i>hit, him,</i> or <i>it;</i>] and ↓ <br>\
      ضرّبهُ [signifies the same in an intensive sense, i. e. <i>he beat,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>him,</i> or <i>it, much,</i> or <i>violently;</i> or in a frequentative sense, i. e. <i>several,</i> or <i>many, times:</i> or rather ضرّب is used in relation to several, or many, objects, as will be shown in what follows]: (K:) accord. to Er-Rághib, الضَّرْبُ signifies <i>the making a thing to fall upon another thing;</i> and, as some say, <i>the making it to fall with violence,</i> or <i>vehemence.</i> (TA.) You say, ضَرَبَهُ بِهِ [<i>He struck him,</i> or <i>it, with it</i>], i. e. with a sword, (A, Mgh, Msb), &amp;amp;c. (A, Msb.) And تَضْرِبُ فِى حَدِيدٍ بَارِدٍ [<i>Thou beatest upon cold iron</i>]: a prov. [expl. in art. حد]. (Har p. 633.) And ضَرَبْتُ زَيْدًا سَوْطًا, meaning بِسَوْطٍ [i. e. <i>I struck Zeyd with a whip</i>], or ضَرْبَةَ سَوْطٍ [<i>a stroke of a whip</i>]: (M in art. سوط, q. v.:) and ضَرَبَهُ مِايَةَ سَوْطٍ [<i>He struck him a hundred strokes of the whip</i>]. (S and K in art. سحل, &amp;amp;c.) And ضَرَبْتُ عُنُقَهُ [<i>I smote his neck,</i> meaning <i>I beheaded him</i>]; and الاَعْنَاقَ ↓ <br>\
      ضَرَّبْتُ [<i>I smote the necks,</i> meaning <i>I struck off the heads</i>]; the teshdeed denoting muchness [of the  action] or multiplicity [of the objects]: AZ says that, when the object is one, the Arabs use only the former verb, without teshdeed; but when there is a plurality of objects, either of the verbs; (Msb;) [so that] one says, ضَرَبُوا اَعْنَاقَهُمْ [<i>They smote their necks,</i> or <i>beheaded them</i>], and اَمَرَ <br>\
                  الرِّقَابِ ↓ <br>\
      بِتَضْرِيبِ [<i>He gave the order to smite the necks,</i> or <i>to strike off the heads</i>]: (A:) فَضَرْبَ <br>\
                  الرِّقَابِ in the Kur xlvii. 4 is originally فَاْضْرِبُوا <br>\
                  الرِّقَابَ ضَرْبًا [meaning <i>Then do ye smite the necks,</i> i. e. <i>strike off the heads</i>]; (Bd;) the inf. n. being here put for its verb. (Jel.) [Respecting the phrase هُوَ اْلْيَضْرِبُكَ, see 1 in art. جدع.] ―         -b2-  [Hence a variety of meanings and phrases here following.] ―         -b3-  ضَرَبَ كَلْبَهُ عَلَى الصَّيْدِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He beat,</i> or <i>disciplined,</i> or <i>trained, his dog for the purpose of the chase</i>]: whence the phrases ضَرَبَ عَلَيْهِ جِرْوَتَهُ and ضَرَبَ جِرْوَةَ نَفْسِهِ and ضَرَبْتُ جِرْوَتِى عَنْهُ [expl. voce جِرْوَةٌ]. (Z, and TA in art. جرو.) ―         -b4-  لَا تُضْرَبُ <br>\
                  اَكْبَادُ الاـِبِلِ اـِلَّا ثَلَاثَةِ مَسَاجِدَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Camels shall not be ridden, save to three mosques:</i> [namely, that of Mekkeh, that of El-Medeeneh, and that of El-Aksà at Jerusalem:] a trad.

(TA.) [ضَرَبَ بِنَفْسِهِ الاَرْضَ see expl. in the latter half of this paragraph.] ―         -b6-  ضَرَبْتُ القَوْسَ بِالمِضْرَبِ <br>\
                  <i>I struck the string of the bow with the wooden implement</i> [or <i>mallet</i>] <i>used in separating cotton.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b7-  ضَرَبَ العُودَ [<i>He struck the chords of the lute;</i> meaning <i>he played upon the lute;</i> and so ضَرَبَ بِالعُودِ]. (S.) ―         -b8-  ضَرَبَ الوَتِدَ, aor. and inf. n. as above, <i>He beat</i> [or <i>knocked</i> or <i>struck</i>] <i>the tent-peg,</i> or <i>stake, so that it became firm in the ground.</i> (Lh, TA.) And [hence] ضَرَبَ الخَيْمَةَ (tropical:)  <i>He pitched the tent, by knocking in its pegs with a mallet:</i> (Kull p. 231:) or <i>he set up the tent.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b9-  ضَرَبَ الدِّرْهَمَ, aor. and inf. n. as above, (tropical:)  <i>He struck, coined,</i> or <i>minted, the dirhem,</i> or <i>piece of money.</i> (TA.) And ضَرَبَ عَلَى اْسمِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He struck, coined,</i> or <i>minted,</i> money <i>in his name</i>]. (ISd, TA in art. جوز.) ―         -b10-  ضَرَبَ عَلَى <br>\
                  المَكْتُوبِ (tropical:)  <i>He sealed,</i> or <i>stamped, the writing.</i> (A, * TA.) [And ضَرَبَ عَلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He erased it;</i> namely, anything written.] ―         -b11-  ضَرَبَ الطِّينَ عَلَى <br>\
                  الجِدَارِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He stuck,</i> or <i>applied, the mud upon the wall,</i> as a plaster]. (TA.) ―         -b12-  Hence, accord. to some, the phrase ضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ اْلذِّلَّةُ, in the Kur ii. 58, considered as meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Vileness was made to cleave to them:</i> or the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  <i>encompassed them,</i> like as the tent encompasses him over whom it is pitched. (Ksh, Bd.) And [in like manner] one says, ضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ضَرِيبَةٌ (tropical:)  <i>An impost,</i> of the tax called جِزْيَة, &amp;amp;c., <i>was imposed upon them.</i> (A, * Mgh, Msb. *) And ضَرَبَ عَلَى <br>\
                  العَبْدِ الاِتَاوَةَ (tropical:)  <i>He imposed upon the slave the tax according to a fixed time.</i> (TA.

                  بِاَرُوَاقِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>The night cast its folds of darkness;</i>] meaning <i>the night came.</i> (TA.) [And (assumed tropical:)  <i>The night became dark,</i> or <i>was dark;</i> as appears from the following verse.] Homeyd says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

(TA. [See also ضَارِبٌ.]) You say also, ضَرَبَ عَلَيْهِ حِجَابًا (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He put,</i> or <i>let down, a veil,</i> or <i>curtain,</i> or <i>covering, over him,</i> or <i>it</i>]. (TA.) And ضُرِبَ بَيْنَهُمَا سَدٌّ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>A barrier was set between them two</i>]. (A in art. سد.) ضَرَبْنَا عَلَى <br>\
                  ا=ذَانِهِمْ [in the Kur xviii. 10] means (tropical:)  <i>We prevented their sleeping;</i> (K, TA;) as though by putting a covering over their ears; a metonymical [and elliptical] mode of saying <i>we made them to sleep</i> by preventing any sound from penetrating into their ears, in consequence of which they would have awoke: (Zj, L, TA:) or ضَرَبَ عَلَى ا=ذَانِهِمْ means (assumed tropical:)  <i>he poured upon them sleep so that they slept and did not awake:</i> and one says also, ضَرَبْتُ النَّوْمَ عَلَى اُذُنِهِ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>I poured sleep upon him by closing his ear</i>].

                  البَرْدُ (IKtt, K, TA) (assumed tropical:)  <i>The cold smote it so as to injure it;</i> namely, herbage; and in like manner one says of the wind: (IKtt, TA:) and ↓ <br>\

                     ضَرِبَ<br>\
                  , (TA,) inf. n. ضِرَابٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ضَرْبٌ also, accord. to Fr, but this latter, though agreeable with analogy, is disallowed by Sb and Akh, (TA,) (tropical:)  <i>The stallion leaped the she-camel;</i> (Msb, TA;) i. e. (TA,) <i>compressed</i> (A, K, TA) <i>her.</i> (TA.) ضِرَابُ <br>\
                  الجَمَلِ is used elliptically for ثَمَنُ ضِرَابِ الجَمَلِ (tropical:)  <i>The hire of the camel&#39;s leaping the female:</i> the taking of which, as also the taking of the hire of any stallion for covering, is forbidden in a trad.

      ضرّبهُ, (K,) inf. n. تَضْرِيبٌ: (TA:) accord. to some, said peculiarly in relation to milk; (MF, TA;) but [SM says,] this I have not found in any lexicon. (TA.) ضَرَبَ اللَّبَنَ فِى السِّقَا=ءِ means (tropical:)  حَقَنَهُ [i. e. <i>He collected the milk in the skin, and poured fresh milk upon that which was curdled,</i> or <i>thick,</i> or <i>upon that which was churned;</i> or <i>he poured the milk into the skin, and kept it therein that its butter might come forth</i>]. (A.) In the L and other lexicons it is said that ضَرَبْتُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِى الشَّرِّ means <i>I caused them to become confused</i> [or <i>I involved them</i>] <i>in evil</i> or <i>mischief.</i> (TA. [And ضرّبت بَيْنَهُمْ has a similar meaning: see 2.]) And ضُربَتِ الشَّاةُ بِلَوْنِ كَذَا means <i>The sheep,</i> or <i>goat, was intermixed with such a colour.</i> (L, TA.) ―         -b20-  ضَرَبَ الشَّجَرُ بِعُرُوقِهِ <br>\
                  فِى الاَرْضِ [<i>The trees struck their roots into the earth</i>]. (A and TA in art. عرق.) ―         -b21-  [Hence, the saying,] ضَرَبَتْ فِيهِ فُلَانَةُ بِعِرْقٍ ذِى اَشَبٍ i. e. اِلْتِبَاس; (S and TA in the present art., and in like manner, in both, in art. اشب, with the addition of ذِى before اِلْتِبَاسٍ;) (tropical:)  [app. meaning <i>Such a woman implanted,</i> or <i>engendered, in him a strain,</i> i. e. <i>a radical,</i> or <i>hereditary, quality, of a dubious kind:</i> or the pronoun in فيه relates to a family, or people; for it is said that] the meaning is, <i>such a woman corrupted their race by her bringing forth among them:</i> or, as some say, عرقت <br>\
                  فِيهِمْ عِرْقَ سَوْءٍ [i. e. عَرَّقَتْ, or, accord. to more common usage, اَعْرَقَتْ, i. e., <i>implanted,</i> or <i>engendered, among them,</i> or <i>in them, an evil strain,</i> or <i>radical</i> or <i>hereditary disposition</i>]. (TA.

                  رِبَابَة (q. v.), <i>in the game called</i> <br>\
                  المُيْسِر,] عَلَى <br>\
                  الجَزورِ [<i>for the slaughtered camel</i>]. (Mgh. [See حُرْضَةٌ.]) [And (assumed tropical:)  <i>He played with the gamingarrows; practised sortilege with arrows,</i> or <i>with the arrows.</i>] You say, ضَرَبْتُ مَعَ القَوْمِ بِسَهْمٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>I practised sortilege with the people,</i> or <i>party, with an arrow;</i> syn. سَاهَمْتُهُمْ. (Msb.) And ضَرَبَ بِالقِدْحَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He practised sortilege with the two arrows;</i> one of which was inscribed with the sentence “ My Lord hath commanded me, ” and the other with “ My Lord hath forbidden me: ” a person between hope and despair is likened to one practising this mode of sortilege, which was used by the people of the Time of Ignorance when they doubted whether they should undertake an affair or abstain from it. (Har pp. 465 and 553.) One says also, ضَرَبَ فِى الجَزُورِبِسَهْمٍ meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>He obtained a share,</i> or <i>portion, of the slaughtered camel.</i> (Mgh.) And hence the saying of El-Hareeree, وَضَرَبْتُ فِى مَرْعَاهَا بِنَصِيبٍ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>And I obtained a share of its pasture</i>]. (Mgh.) And the lawyers say, يَضْرِبُ فِيهِ بِالثُّلُثِ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  <i>He shall take thereof somewhat, according to what is due to him, of the third part.</i> (Mgh.) They say also,  <br>\

                  فِيمَا زَادَ عَلَى الثُّلُثِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He shall not assign,</i> or <i>give, to the legatee,</i> aught <i>of more than the third part;</i> the true objective complement being suppressed. (Mgh.) ―         -b23-  ضَرَبَ بِيَدَيْهِ [lit. <i>He beat with his arms;</i> meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>he moved his arms about,</i> or <i>to and fro; brandished, tossed,</i> or <i>swung them</i>]: you say, ضَرَبَ بِيَدَيْهِ وَحَرَّكَهُمَا فِى مِشْيَتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He swung his arms, and moved them about, in his manner of walking</i>]. (TA in art. جدف. [See جَدَفَ.]) And ضَرَبَ فِى المَا=ءِ [بِيَدَيْهِ being understood after the verb] (assumed tropical:)  <i>He swam.</i> (K.) ―         -b24-  ضَرَبَ <br>\
                  بِيَدِهِ اـِلَى شَىْءٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He made a sign,</i> or <i>pointed, with his hand, towards a thing.</i> (TA.)

And ضَرَبَ بِيَدِهِ اـِلَى كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  <i>He put forth his hand towards such a thing, to take it,</i> or <i>to point,</i> or <i>make a sign.</i> (TA.) And ضَرَبَ يَدَهُ اـِلَى عَمَلِ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He applied his hand to the doing of such a thing</i>]. (Lth, TA.) [And ضَرَبَ يَدَيْهِ فِى المَالِ a phrase expl. to me by IbrD as meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>He busied his hands with the property,</i> in the giving, or dispensing of it.] ―         -b25-  ضَرَبَ عَلَى يَدِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He struck his</i> (i. e. another man&#39;s) <i>hand;</i> meaning] <i>he struck,</i> or <i>made, the bargain with him;</i> or <i>ratified the sale with him:</i> for it is a custom, when two persons are bargaining together, for one of them to put his hand upon the other&#39;s in ratifying the bargain. (TA, from a trad.) ―         -b26-  And (tropical:)  <i>He prohibited,</i> or <i>prevented,</i> or <i>hindered, him, from doing a thing,</i> or <i>from doing a thing that he had begun:</i> (TA:) and [in like manner] ضَرَبَ عَلَى يَدَيْهِ (tropical:)  <i>he withheld,</i> or <i>restrained, him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (K, TA.) And (i. e. the former phrase) (tropical:)  <i>He</i> (the judge, A, Mgh, TA) <i>prohibited,</i> or <i>interdicted, him from the using,</i> or <i>disposing of, his property according to his own free will.</i> (S, A, Mgh, Msb, TA.) ―         -b27-  Also (tropical:)  <i>He corrupted, vitiated, marred,</i> or <i>disordered, his affair,</i> or <i>case,</i> or <i>state.</i> (A, Msb, TA.) ―         -b28-  ضَرَبَ عَنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He turned away</i> a person or thing <i>from him</i> [or <i>it</i>]; as also ↓ <br>\
      اضرب: (TA:) [or] عنه ↓ <br>\
      اضرب signifies, (S, Msb,) or signifies also, (TA,) and (Msb, TA) so does ضَرَبَ عنه, (Msb, K, TA,) [the latter app. for ضَرَبَ نَفْسَهُ عَنْهُ,] (assumed tropical:)  <i>He turned away from, avoided, shunned,</i> or <i>left, him,</i> or <i>it;</i> (S *  Msb, K * TA; *) namely, a person, (TA,) or a thing. (Msb.) اَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنْكُمُ اْلذِّكْرَ صَفْحًا, in the Kur [xliii. 4], is said to mean (assumed tropical:)  <i>Shall we then neglect you, and not teach you what is incumbent on you?</i> the phrase being taken from a rider&#39;s striking his beast with his stick when he desires to turn him from the course that he is pursuing: or the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  <i>shall we then turn away the Kur-án from you,</i> and not invite you thereby to the faith, <i>turning away ourselves</i> from you? (TA.) One says also, ضَرَبْتُ عَنْهُ صَفْحًا meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>I turned away from him and left him.</i> (S and TA in art. صفح: see 1 in that art.) See also the saying ضَرَبَ اَخْمَاسَهُ فِى اَسْدَاسِهِ voce خُمُسٌ. ―         -b29-  And فُلَانٌ يَضْرِبُ اَخْمَاسًا لِاَسْدَاسٍ: see voce خِمْسٌ. ―         -b30-  ضَرَبَ بِنَفْسِهِ الاَرْضَ, (K,) inf. n. ضَرْبٌ, (TA,) [lit. <i>He smote with himself the ground;</i> and hence, (assumed tropical:)  <i>he cast, threw,</i> or <i>flung, himself upon the ground;</i> app. often used in this sense; (a phrase similar to ضَرَبَ بِهِ الاَرْضَ expl. before;) and hence,] (assumed tropical:)  <i>he remained, stayed,</i> or <i>abode;</i> (K;) and so ↓ <br>\
