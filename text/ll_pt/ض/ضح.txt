                   The <i>sun:</i> (S, O, K:) and (K) the <i>light of the sun,</i> (Lth, A, O, K,) <i>when it has possession of the ground:</i> (Lth, O, TA:) or the <i>light of the sun upon the surface of the ground; sunshine; contr. of</i> <br>\
                  ظِلٌّ: (AHeyth, T, O, TA:) accord. to AHeyth, originally وِضْحٌ, the و being rejected and a ح added to the radical ح; but correctly, it is originally ضِحْىٌ, from ضحيت الشمس [app. a mistranscription for ضَحِيتُ لِلشَّمْسِ]: (TA; as from the T:) also <i>land,</i> or <i>ground, that lies open and exposed</i> (K, TA) <i>to the sun:</i> (TA:) and <i>what is shone upon,</i> or <i>smitten, by the sun:</i> (K, TA:) it has no pl. in any of these senses. (ElFihree, TA.) It is said in a trad., لَا يَقْعُدَنَّ <br>\
                  اَحَدُكُمْ بَيْنَ الضِّحِّ وَالظِّلِّ فَاـِنَّهُ مَقْعَدُ الشَّيْطَانِ (S, A) (tropical:)  [<i>None of you shall sit between the sunshine and the shade, for it is the sitting-place of the devil</i>]; meaning half of him in the sun and half of him in the shade.

                  وَالرِّيحِ: (TA:) this the vulgar say, but [J affirms that] it is nought: (S:) several, however, assert that الضِّيح is correct: (MF:) [and the author of the K, who disallows it in this art., authorizes it in art. ضيح, q. v.:] Kr, also, is related to have said that الضِيحُ signifies “ the sun ” and “ its light; ” and is said to signify “ what is exposed to the sun: ” and a poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَالشَّمْسُ فِى اللُّجَّةِ ذَاتِ الضِّيحِ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>And the sun in the abyss of sunlight</i>]: Aboo-Mis-hal, moreover, mentions, in his “ Nawádir, ” the saying, اُسْتُعْمِلَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى الضِّيحِ وَالرِّيحِ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Such a one was employed as manager of much property</i>]. (TA.) مَاتَ عَنِ الضِّحِّ وَالرِّيحِ, occurring in a trad., is rendered agreeably with the explanation of the saying in a trad. mentioned above, and means (tropical:)  <i>He died leaving much property.</i> (TA.) And it is said of the Prophet, in a trad., يَكُونُ فِى الضِّحِّ وَالرِّيحِ <br>\
                  <i>He will be exposed to the heat of the sun and the blowing of the winds;</i> meaning, accord. to Hr, (assumed tropical:)  <i>he will be attended by,</i> or <i>in the midst of, numerous horsemen and military forces.</i> (TA.)     <br>\
