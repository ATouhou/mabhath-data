      ضَغْطَةٌ: (TA: [in which one of the syns. is written قَبْر, evidently a mistake for قَهْرٌ, one of the syns. of the former word in the Mgh:]) <i>constraint,</i> or <i>compulsion, against the will of the object thereof.</i> (S, * K.) You say, اَخَذْتُ فُلَانًا <br>\

Accord. to IDrd, بَعِيرٌ بِهِ ضَاغِطٌ means <i>A camel whose arm-pit comes in contact with his side so as to mark it,</i> or <i>scar it.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  (tropical:)  <i>A watcher, keeper,</i> or <i>guardian; a confidential superintendent;</i> (S, K;) over a person; so called because he straitens him; (S;) or over a thing. (K.) You say, ارْسَلَهُ ضَاغِطًا عَلَى فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  <i>He sent him as a watcher,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>over such a one.</i> (S, TA.) And hence what is said in the trad. of Mo&#39;ádh, (S, L,) when his wife asked him, on his return from collecting the poor-rates in El-Yemen, where was the present which he had brought for his wife, and he answered, (L,) كَانَ عَلَىَّ ضَاغِطٌ [<i>There was over me a watcher</i>], (S,) or كَانَ مَعِى ضَاغِطٌ [<i>There was with me a watcher</i>], meaning God, who knows the secrets of men; or he meant, by ضاغط, the trust committed to him by God, which he had taken upon himself; but his wife imagined that there was with him a watcher who straitened him, and prevented his taking to please her.
