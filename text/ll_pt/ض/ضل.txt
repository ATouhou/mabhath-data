                  , (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. ضَلَالٌ and ضَلَالَةٌ; (S, * O, * Msb;) and ضَلِلْتُ, (S, Mgh, * O, Msb, * K,) third pers. as above; (Mgh;) the former of the dial. of Nejd, and the more chaste; the latter of the dial. of the people of El-&#39;Áliyeh, (S, Msb, TA,) and of El- Hijáz, and Kr has mentioned ضِلِلْتُ for ضَلِلْتُ as heard from the tribe of Temeem; (TA;) <i>I erred, strayed,</i> or <i>went astray;</i> (Mgh, Msb;) <i>deviated from the right way</i> or <i>course,</i> or <i>from that which was right; missed,</i> or <i>lost, the right way;</i> or <i>lost my way;</i> <br>\
                  ضَلَالٌ and ضَلَالَةٌ signifying the <i>contr. of</i> <br>\
                  رَشَادٌ, (S, O, TA,) and هُدًى. (K, TA.) [See ضَلَالٌ below.] Hence, in the Kur [xxxiv. 49], قُلْ اـِنْ ضَلَلْتُ فِاـِنَّمَا اَضِلُّ عَلَى نَفْسِى [<i>Say thou, If I err, I shall err only against myself,</i> i. e., to my own hurt]. (O, Msb. [See also x. 108 and xvii. 16 of the Kur.]) One says also, ضَلَّ ضَلَالُهُ [app. <i>His error became error indeed;</i> a phrase similar to جَدَّ جِدُّهُ, q. v.: or <i>his erring passed away;</i> see 4, latter part]. (TA.) And ضَلَّ عَنِ القَصْدِ <br>\
                  <i>He deviated from the right way</i> or <i>course.</i> (TA.) And the verb is trans. as well as intrans.: you say, ضَلَّ الطَّرِيقَ, and ضَلَّ عَنْهُ, aor.      <br>\
                     ضَلِ٣َ<br>\
                   and      <br>\
                     ضَلَ٣َ<br>\
                  , (Mgh, Msb,) inf. ns. as above, meaning <i>He erred, strayed,</i> or <i>went astray, from the road,</i> or <i>way;</i> (Msb;) <i>he did not find the way to the road:</i> (Mgh, Msb:) and of anything stationary, if you miss the place thereof, you say ضَلَلْتُهُ and ضَلِلْتُهُ: (Az, Msb:) or you say, ضَلِلْتُ الطَّرِيقَ, (K,) or ضَلِلْتُ المَسْجِدَ, and الدَّارَ, (ISk, S, O,) [<i>I missed,</i> or <i>lost, the right way to the road,</i> or <i>the mosque,</i> and <i>the house,</i>] when you know not the place thereof: (ISk, S, O:) and in like manner, anything stationary, to which one does not find the way: (ISk, S, O, K:) and AA says the like: but that one says of a thing that falls from his hand, and a thing that quits its place, ↓ <br>\
      اَضْلَلْتُهُ, (IB, TA,) which means <i>I lost it, and knew not its place;</i> meaning, for instance, a horse, or she-camel, or the like: (Az, Msb:) [thus] one says, اَضْلَلْتُ بِعِيرِى [<i>I lost my camel, and knew not his place,</i>] (AA, ISk, S, IB, O) when his shank has been tied up to his arm and one does not find the way to him, and when he has been left loose and has gone away whither one knows not: (AA, IB, TA:) but Yoo differs from others respecting this case; for, accord. to him, one says, اضلّ <br>\
                  فُلَانٌ بَعِيرَهُ and also ضَلَّهُ, in the same sense; (O, TA;) and the like is said in the K: (TA:) and it is also said in the Bári&#39; that when you seek an animal and miss its place and find not the way to it, it is regarded as in the category of stationary things, and therefore you say ضَلِلْتُهُ. (Msb.) ―         -b2-  ضَلَّ signifies also <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, confounded,</i> or <i>perplexed, and unable to see his right course.</i> (Ibn-Es-Seed, TA.) ―         -b3-  Also, aor.      <br>\
                     ضَلِ٣َ<br>\
                   (S, O, K) and      <br>\
                     ضَلَ٣َ<br>\
                  , (K,) the pret. being like زَلَّ and مَلَّ, (TA,) inf. n. ضَلَال, <i>It</i> (a thing, S, O, TA) <i>became lost;</i> [as though it went astray;] <i>it perished, came to nought,</i> or <i>passed away.</i> (S, O, K, TA.) Thus in the phrase ضَلَّ عَنِّى كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>Such a thing became lost from me.</i> (Mgh.) One says to him from whom pieces of money have dropped, قَدْ ضَلَّتْ عَنْكَ [<i>They have become lost from thee</i>]. (TA.) And to him who has done a deed from which no profit has resulted, you say, قَد ضَلَّ سَعْيُكَ (tropical:)  [<i>Thy labour has been lost</i>]: the like occurs in the Kur xviii. 104, meaning ضَاعَ. (TA, in two places.) ―         -b4-  And (tropical:)  <i>He</i> (a man, TA) <i>died, and became dust and bones.</i> (K, TA.) In this sense the verb is used in the Kur xxxii. 9: but some there read, in the place of ضَلَلْنَا, صَلِلْنَا [q. v.], with ص: (TA:) or the verb in that instance has the meaning here next following. (S.) ―         -b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  <i>He,</i> or <i>it,</i> (a man, S, TA, or a camel, Msb, and a thing, TA,) <i>was,</i> or <i>became, unperceived</i> or <i>imperceptible, unapparent, latent, hidden</i> or <i>concealed,</i> or <i>absent,</i> (S, Msb, K, TA.) Hence the phrase, ضَلَّ المَا=ءُ فِى اللَّبَنِ (tropical:)  [<i>The water became unperceived,</i> or <i>concealed, in the milk</i>]. (TA.) One says of a road to which he has not been able to find the way, ضَلَّ عَنِّى <br>\
                   [<i>It has become hidden from me</i>]. (K, TA.) And hence also the saying of a man, as is related in a trad., (S, O, TA,) after his having charged his sons by saying to them, “ When I die, burn ye me; and when I shall have become ashes, pound me; then scatter me in the water: ” (O, TA:) لَعَلِّى اَضِلُّ اْللّٰه (S, O, TA) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  <i>May-be, I shall be unperceived by God,</i> or <i>concealed from Him:</i> (S:) or <i>may-be, I shall be hidden,</i> or <i>absent, from God&#39;s punishment:</i> (O, TA:) or, as El-&#39;Otbee says, <i>may-be, I shall escape God, and my place will be hidden from Him.</i> (TA.) And ضَلَّ said of one forgetting means (assumed tropical:)  <i>His memory became absent from him.</i> (O, Msb, TA.) اَنْ تَضِلَّ اـِحْدَاهُمَا, or اـِنْ تَضِلَّ, in the Kur [ii. 282], accord. to different readers, (TA,) in which instance اَنْ and اـِنْ are syn., (Mughnee, [see اَنْ, in p. 106, cols. 1 and 2,]) means <i>If one of them twain</i> [referring to women] <i>be absent from her memory:</i> or <i>if the memory of one of them twain be absent from her:</i> [or <i>if one of them twain err in her memory:</i>] or, accord. to Zj, the meaning of the verb in this case is that which next follows. (TA.) ―         -b6-  ضَلِلْتُ <br>\
                  الشَّىْءَ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>I forgot the thing:</i> whence one says of a woman, ضَلَّتْ اَيَّامَ حَيْضِهَا (assumed tropical:)  [<i>She forgot the days of her menstruation</i>]; and so ↓ <br>\
      اَضَلَّتْهَا: (Mgh:) or ضَلَّ فُلَانًا (assumed tropical:)  <i>He was made,</i> or <i>caused, to forget such a one.</i> (K. [In the CK, اُنْسِيْهِ is erroneously put for اُنْسِيَهُ.]) It is said that لَا يَضِلُّ رَبِّى, in the Kur xx. 54, means (assumed tropical:)  <i>My Lord will not be unmindful:</i> or <i>nothing will escape Him.</i> (TA.) ―         -b7-  And one says, ضَلَّنِى فُلَانٌ, (Msb, K,) or ضَلَّنِى فُلَانٌ فَلَمْ اَقْدَرْ عَلَيْهِ, (O,) meaning <i>Such a one went away from me,</i> (O, Msb, K,) <i>and I was unable to compass him</i> [or <i>to find him</i>]: so in the Bári&#39;. (Msb.)       -A2-  ضُلَّ, as a verb of wonder: see ضُلٌّ.    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>ضلَلهُ</b>               1     <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                  , (S, MA, O, K,) inf. n. تَضْلِيلٌ and تَضْلَالٌ, (K,) <i>He,</i> or <i>it, made,</i> or <i>caused, him to pursue a course that led to error,</i> or <i>deviation from the right way:</i> (K: [see also 4:]) <i>he,</i> or <i>it, led him astray; seduced him:</i> (MA:) [or] <i>he attributed,</i> or <i>imputed, to him error,</i> or <i>deviation from the right way.</i> (S, MA, O.) ضُلِّلَ سَعْيُهُمْ, a phrase used by a poet, means <i>Error,</i> or <i>deviation from the right way, was attributed to their labour;</i> because they did not reach their goal. (Ham p. 771.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] one says, ضَلِّلْ مَالَكَ <br>\
                  <i>Send forth,</i> or <i>set free, thy cattle to pasture,</i> or <i>to pasture where they please, by themselves.</i> (O.) ―         -b3-  See also the next paragraph.    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>اضلّهُ</b>               1     <br>\
                     اضلّهُ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  , inf. n. اـِضْلَالٌ, <i>He,</i> or <i>it, made him,</i> or <i>caused him, to err, stray,</i> or <i>go astray; to deviate from the right way</i> or <i>course,</i> or <i>from that which was right; to miss,</i> or <i>lose, the right way;</i> or <i>to lose his way.</i> (Az, TA.) [See also 2, first sentence.] الاـِضْلَالُ is of two sorts: one of these is the consequence of erring, or straying; either as in the case in which one says اَضْلَلْتُ البَعِيرَ (expl. above, see 1, former half); or the decreeing that one shall err, or stray, &amp;amp;c., because he has done so already, and this is sometimes the case when the اـِضْلَال of a man is attributed to God: the other sort is the embellishing [or commending] to a man that which is false, or wrong, or vain, in order that he may err, or stray, &amp;amp;c.: and God&#39;s اـِضْلَال of a man is of two sorts; one of which has been expl. above; the other is God&#39;s so constituting man that when he observes [and pursues] a certain course, or way, [of acting or the like], whether it be such as is commended or such as is discommended, he habituates himself to it, and esteems it pleasant, and keeps to it, and finds it difficult to turn from it, wherefore it is said that custom is a second nature. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―         -b2-  Also <i>He,</i> or <i>it, made,</i> or <i>caused, him,</i> or <i>it, to perish,</i> or <i>become lost;</i> syn. اَهْلَكَهُ, (S, TA,) and اَضَاعَهُ, (El-Fárábee, S, O, Msb,) or ضَيَّعَهُ; (TA;) [اضاعهُ and ضيّعهُ signifying the same; and so اضلّهُ and ↓ <br>\
      ضللّٰهُ; whence,] اَلَمْ يَجْعَلْ كَيْدَهُمْ <br>\
                  فِى تَضْلِيلٍ, in the Kur cv. 2, means [<i>Did He not make their plot to be</i> such as ended] <i>in a causing to perish,</i> or <i>become lost,</i> (فِى تَضْيِيعٍ,) and <i>in annulment?</i> (Ksh, Bd.) اَضَلَّ اَعْمَالَهُمْ, in the Kur [xlvii. 1 and 9, which may be rendered (assumed tropical:)  <i>He will cause their works to be lost,</i> or <i>to be of no effect</i>], means, accord. to Aboo-Is-hák, <i>He will not recompense them for their</i> good <i>works;</i> the phrase being similar to the saying قَدْ ضَلَّ سَعْيُكَ [expl. above]. (TA.) And اَضَلَّ اْللّٰهُ ضَلَالَكَ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>May God make thine erring to be no more,</i> or <i>to come to an end,</i>] is expl. by ISk as meaning <i>may thine erring pass away from thee, so that thou shalt not err;</i> and he adds that the saying مَلَّ مَلَالُكَ means ذَهَبَ <br>\
                  عَنْكَ حَتَّى لَا تَمَلَّ. (TA.) ―         -b3-  Also (tropical:)  <i>He buried,</i> and <i>hid,</i> or <i>concealed, him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (K, TA.) You say, اُضِلَّ المَيِّتُ (tropical:)  <i>The dead was buried.</i> (S, O.) The phrase اَضَلَّتْ بِهِ اُمُّهُ, meaning (tropical:)  <i>His mother buried him,</i> in a verse cited by IAar, is extr., or anomalous. (TA.) ―         -b4-  And <i>He found him to be erring, straying, going astray; deviating from the right way</i> or <i>course,</i> or <i>from that which was right; missing,</i> or <i>losing, the right way; losing his way; not rightly directed,</i> or <i>not finding the way to the truth:</i> like as one says اَحْمَدَهُ, and اَبْخَلَهُ. (TA.) ―         -b5-  And you say, اَضَلَّنِى كَذَا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Such a thing was,</i> or <i>became, beyond my power,</i> or <i>compass.</i> (IAar, Msb, TA.) ―         -b6-  See also 1, near the end.    </entryFree> <br>\

(S, TA.) ―         -b3-  And hence [its usage, in the manner of a proper name, in] the saying, هُوَ ضُلُّ بْنُ ضُلٍّ, (S,) which means, (S, O, K,) as also ↓ <br>\
      هُوَ ضِلُّ بْنُ ضِلٍّ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K,) <i>He is the unknown, the son of the unknown;</i> (S, Z, O, K;) and in like manner, بْنُ التَّلَالِ ↓ <br>\
      الضَّلَالُ; (S, O;) and قُلُّ بْنُ قُلٍّ: (TA:) or <i>he is one in whom is no good:</i> (K:) or <i>he is one who persists in error.</i> (M, K.) ―         -b4-  [Hence also, perhaps, it is said that] يَا ضُلَّ مَا تَجْرِى بِهِ العَصَا [in the CK ضَلَّ] means يَا فَقْدَهُ and يَا تَلَفَهُ [i. e., app., <i>O the loss,</i> or <i>O the coming to nought, of that by reason of which</i> the mare <i>El-&#39;Asà is running!</i>]: (K, TA:) a prov.; said by Kaseer Ibn-Saad to Jedheemeh El-Abrash, when he went with him to Ez-Zebbà; for when they were within her province, he repented, and Kaseer said to him, “ Mount this my horse, and escape upon him, for his dust will not be cloven [by the pursuer, ” i. e. he will not be overtaken]: (TA: [but the mare is thus made a male:]) or it was said by &#39;Amr Ibn-&#39;Adee, when he saw El-&#39;Asà, the mare of Jedheemeh, with Kaseer upon her: قَوْمُ is suppressed after يا; and ↓ <br>\
      ضُلَّ is of the forms [of verbs] denoting wonder, originally ضَلُلَ, with damm, like حُبَّ in the phrase حُبَّ بِفُلَانٍ, originally حَبُبَ; and the meaning of the prov. is, <i>O</i> people, <i>what a case of perdition is that by reason of which El-&#39;Asà is running!</i> i. e., the death of Jedheemeh.
