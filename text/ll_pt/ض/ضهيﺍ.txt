      ضَهْيَاَةٌ: (K:) or the latter is an epithet applied to a woman in these two senses: (O: [in which the former word, without ة, is not mentioned:]) Seer says, in his Expos. of “ the Book ” of Sb, that ضَهْيَاٌ, like ضَهْيَا=ءُ [which belongs to art. ضهى], is a subst. as well as an epithet, signifying &lt;i&gt;a woman whose breast has not grown forth:&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;one who has not menstruated:&lt;/i&gt; ―         -b2-  and also (assumed tropical:)  &lt;i&gt;A land that has not given growth to anything:&lt;/i&gt; (MF, TA:) or ↓ <br>\
      ضَهْيَاَةٌ signifies as above: and also (assumed tropical:)  a desert (فَلَاةٌ) &lt;i&gt;having in it no water:&lt;/i&gt; (O, K, TA:) or &lt;i&gt;that does not give growth to anything;&lt;/i&gt; app. because it has no water. (TA.) [Accord. to those who hold the ى to be augmentative,] a woman is thus termed because she resembles men (لِاَنَّهَا ضَاهَاَتِ <br>\
