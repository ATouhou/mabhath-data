                   see the next paragraph, in two places. ―         -b2-  One says also, ضَوَّاْتُ عَنْهُ [meaning <i>I brought to light, made visible, discovered,</i> or <i>revealed, him,</i> or <i>it</i>]. (M, TA.) A sheep, or goat, belonging to an Arab of the desert strayed; whereupon he said, اَللّٰهُمَّ ضَوِّيْ عَنْهُ [<i>O God, bring it to light,</i> or <i>discover it</i>]. (A, TA.)       -A2-  Accord. to Lth, but he is the only authority for it known by AM, (TA,) ضَوَّاَ عَنِ الاَمْرِ, inf. n. تَضْوِيَةٌ, means <i>He declined,</i> or <i>turned away, from the affair.</i> (K, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  , (M, Msb, K,) said of a thing, (M,) [as, for instance,] of the moon, (Msb,) or اضا=ءت, said of fire (النَّار,), (A &#39;Obeyd, S, O,) inf. n. اـِضَا=ءٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ <br>\
      ضَا=ءَ, (M, Msb, K,) or ضَا=ءَت, (S, O,) aor. يَضُوْءُ, (M,) or تَضُوْءُ, (S,) inf. n. ضَوْءٌ (S, M, O, Msb, K) and ضُوْءٌ, (S, O, K,) or the latter is a simple subst.; (Msb;) but the former verb is preferred; (TA;) <i>It gave light, was light</i> or <i>bright, shone,</i> or <i>shone brightly.</i> (Msb, K, * TA.) [See also an ex. of ↓ the latter verb in a verse cited voce اُفُقٌ; and cited here in the TA.] And اَضَاْتُ لَهُ [<i>I gave light to him</i>]. (M.)       -A2-  The former verb is also trans.: you say, اَضَا=ءَتْهُ النَّارُ [<i>The fire made it to be light</i> or <i>bright, to shine,</i> or <i>to shine brightly</i>]: (S, O:) and اَضَاْتُهُ and ↓ <br>\
      ضَوَّاْتُهُ [<i>I made it to give light, to be light</i> or <i>bright, to shine,</i> or <i>to shine brightly</i>]: (M, Msb, * K:) and اَضَاْتُ بِهِ البَيْتَ and بِهِ ↓ <br>\
      ضَوَّاْتُهُ [<i>I lighted,</i> or <i>illumined, with it</i> (i. e. with a lamp or the like) <i>the house,</i> or <i>chamber,</i> or <i>tent</i>]. (M.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] اضا=ء بِبَوْلِهِ (tropical:)  <i>He ejected his urine</i> [so as to make its drops to glisten]; or <i>emitted it and then stopped it;</i> syn. حَذَفَ بِهِ; (K, TA;) or خَذَفَ بِهِ; (so in a copy of the M, as on the authority of Kr;) or, as in the A, اَذْرَعَ بِهِ. (TA.) ―         -b3-  And they said مَا اَضْوَاَهُ [<i>How light,</i> or <i>bright, is it!</i>]. (S voce اَظْلَمَ [q. v.].) ―         -b4-  And اضا=ء signifies also اَصَابَ ضَوْءًا [<i>He saw</i> (lit. <i>lighted on,</i> or <i>found,</i>) <i>light,</i> or <i>brightness</i>].

                   [<i>I sought to obtain light by means of it; I made use of it for light</i>]. (M, K.) لَا تَسْتَضِيوُوا بِنَارِ اَهْلِ الشِّرْكِ [lit. <i>Seek not ye to obtain light by means of the fire of the people of belief in a plurality of gods</i>], (O, K,) a saying of the Prophet, (O,) means (tropical:)  <i>seek not ye counsel,</i> or <i>advice, of the believers in a plurality of gods, in affairs:</i> (O, K:) because he whose affair is confused and dubious to him is as though he were in darkness.

      ضُوْءٌ and ↓ <br>\

      ضِوَا=ءٌ, (M, K,) the last of which is [erroneously] written in the L ضَوَا=ءٌ, (TA,) signify the same, (S, M, O, K,) i. e. <i>Light,</i> syn. نُورٌ, (K, TA,) accord. to the leading lexicologists; but see what follows: (TA:) and ضَوْءٌ is an inf. n. of ضَا=ءَ, (S, M, O, Msb, K,) and so is ↓ <br>\
      ضُوْءٌ, (S, O, K,) or this is a simple subst. from ضَا=ءَ, and so is ↓ <br>\
      ضِيَا=ءٌ, which is also, sometimes, written ↓ <br>\
      ضِيَا=ءٌ, from اَضَا=ءَ as syn. with ضَا=ءَ: (Msb:) the pl. of ضَوْءٌ (M, TA) and ↓ <br>\
      ضُوْءٌ (M) is اَضْوَا=ءٌ; and ↓ <br>\
      ضِيَا=ءٌ is sometimes a pl., (M, TA,) as Zj states it to be: (TA:) some say that ضَوْءٌ has a more intensive signification than نُورٌ, and that hence God has likened his direction [the Kur-án] to النُّور rather than to الضَّوْء; because if it were otherwise, no one had erred: and that hence, also, [in the Kur x. 5,] the sun is termed ↓ <br>\
      ضِيَا=ء; and the moon, نُورٌ: it is also said that ضَوْءٌ signifies the <i>rays that are diffused by what is termed</i> <br>\
                  نُورٌ: the kádee Zekereeyà affirms that these two words are syn. by their original application, but that ضَوْءٌ is more forcible accord. to usage: and some say that الضَّوْءُ signifies <i>that</i> [<i>light</i>] <i>which subsists by itself,</i> as [that of] the sun, and fire; and النُّورُ, to that which subsists by some other thing [as does the light of the moon].
