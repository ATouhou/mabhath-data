(AHeyth, L.) And ضِدٌّ is sometimes a pl., (K,) or sometimes denotes a collective body; (Akh, S, L;) as in the phrase يَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدًّا, (S, L, K,) in the Kur [xix. 85], (S, L,) meaning <i>They shall be adversaries,</i> or <i>enemies, to them:</i> (&#39;Ikrimeh, Jel:) or <i>helpers against them.</i> (Fr, Jel.)
