(O, K, * TA.) ―         -b4-  تُضِيفُ اـِلَى صَوْتِ الفَحْلِ, said of a she-camel, means <i>She hears with desire of going to him the voice,</i> or <i>sound, of the stallion.</i> (M.) ―         -b5-  And الاـِضَافَةُ and ↓ <br>\
      التَّضَايُفُ signify <i>Correlation,</i> or <i>reciprocal relation, so that one of the two cannot be conceived in the mind without the other;</i> as in the case of الاُبُوَّةُ and البُنُوَّةُ [i. e. fathership and sonship]. (KT. [See also 3.])       -A2-  اضافهُ اـِلَيْهِ <br>\
                  <i>He made it to incline towards it;</i> (S, M, * O, Msb, K; *) namely, a thing (S, O) to a thing. (S, O, Msb.) <i>He made it to lean, rest,</i> or <i>stay itself, against it,</i> or <i>upon it.</i> (M, TA.) You say, اضاف ظَهْرَهُ اـِلَى الحَايِطِ <br>\
                  <i>He leaned his back against the wall.</i> (MA.) And اضاف اـِلَيْهِ اَمْرًا (tropical:)  <i>He rested,</i> or <i>stayed, upon him an affair, and desired him to do what would suffice.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  And <i>He made him to have recourse to it,</i> or <i>to betake himself to it for refuge.</i> (S, O, K.) ―         -b3-  And <i>He adjoined it to it.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b4-  And hence الاـِضَافَةُ as a conventional term of the grammarians; because the first [of two nouns in the case to which it applies] is adjoined to the second: (Msb:) [for] اـِضَافَةُ الاِسْمِ اـِلَى الاِسْمِ is [<i>The prefixing the noun to the noun so that the former governs the latter in the gen. case</i>] as when you say غُلَامُ زَيْدٍ; in which instance, غلام is termed ↓ <br>\
      مُضَافٌ, and زيد is termed اـِلَيْهِ ↓ <br>\
      مُضَافٌ: and this is done for the purpose of particularizing or appropriating, and of making known or definite: therefore the اـِضَافَة of a thing to itself [i. e. the prefixing a noun in this manner to one identical therewith in meaning] is not allowable, because a thing does not make known, or definite, itself; (S;) unless by an ellipsis, as when you say حَقُّ اليَقِينِ for حَقُّ الشَّىْءِ اليَقِينِ; or, accord. to Fr, the Arabs used to do so because of the difference of the two words themselves. (S voce جَامِعٌ.) [الاـِضَافَةُ is also often used as meaning <i>The state of being prefixed in the manner explained above;</i> or <i>the connection of a noun so prefixed with its complement.</i> The various kinds of اـِضَافَة are sufficiently explained in the grammars of De Sacy and others: they are not proper subjects of a lexicon, though much is said respecting them in the O, and more in the Msb. ―         -b5-  Hence also, بِالاـِضَافَةِ اـِلَى كَذَا meaning <i>In comparison with</i> (lit. <i>to</i>), or <i>in relation to,</i> (like بِالنِّسْبَةِ اـِلَى,) <i>such a thing;</i> as though <i>in juxtaposition to it:</i> a phrase of frequent occurrence: see an ex. in Bd ii. 6.] ―         -b6-  اَضَفْتُهُ (inf. n. اـِضَافَةٌ, Msb) and ↓ <br>\
      ضَيَّفْتُهُ (inf. n. تَضْيِيفٌ, O) both signify the same, (S, M, O, Msb, K,) from الضِّيَافَةُ; (O;) i. e. both signify <i>I made him a guest,</i> or <i>lodged him,</i> or <i>gave him refuge</i> or <i>asylum,</i> syn. اَنْزَلْتُهُ, (S, M, Msb,) <i>with me, as a</i> <br>\
