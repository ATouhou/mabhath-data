(M, TA.) A sheep, or goat, belonging to an Arab of the desert strayed; whereupon he said, اَللّٰهُمَّ ضَوِّيْ عَنْهُ [&lt;i&gt;O God, bring it to light,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;discover it&lt;/i&gt;]. (A, TA.)       -A2-  Accord. to Lth, but he is the only authority for it known by AM, (TA,) ضَوَّاَ عَنِ الاَمْرِ, inf. n. تَضْوِيَةٌ, means &lt;i&gt;He declined,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;turned away, from the affair.&lt;/i&gt; (K, TA.)    &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\

      ضَا=ءَ, (M, Msb, K,) or ضَا=ءَت, (S, O,) aor. يَضُوْءُ, (M,) or تَضُوْءُ, (S,) inf. n. ضَوْءٌ (S, M, O, Msb, K) and ضُوْءٌ, (S, O, K,) or the latter is a simple subst.; (Msb;) but the former verb is preferred; (TA;) &lt;i&gt;It gave light, was light&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;bright, shone,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;shone brightly.&lt;/i&gt; (Msb, K, * TA.) [See also an ex. of ↓ the latter verb in a verse cited voce اُفُقٌ; and cited here in the TA.] And اَضَاْتُ لَهُ [&lt;i&gt;I gave light to him&lt;/i&gt;]. (M.)       -A2-  The former verb is also trans.: you say, اَضَا=ءَتْهُ النَّارُ [&lt;i&gt;The fire made it to be light&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;bright, to shine,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;to shine brightly&lt;/i&gt;]: (S, O:) and اَضَاْتُهُ and ↓ <br>\

      ضَوَّاْتُهُ [&lt;i&gt;I lighted,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;illumined, with it&lt;/i&gt; (i. e. with a lamp or the like) &lt;i&gt;the house,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;chamber,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;tent&lt;/i&gt;]. (M.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] اضا=ء بِبَوْلِهِ (tropical:)  &lt;i&gt;He ejected his urine&lt;/i&gt; [so as to make its drops to glisten]; or &lt;i&gt;emitted it and then stopped it;&lt;/i&gt; syn. حَذَفَ بِهِ; (K, TA;) or خَذَفَ بِهِ; (so in a copy of the M, as on the authority of Kr;) or, as in the A, اَذْرَعَ بِهِ. (TA.) ―         -b3-  And they said مَا اَضْوَاَهُ [&lt;i&gt;How light,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;bright, is it!&lt;/i&gt;]. (S voce اَظْلَمَ [q. v.].) ―         -b4-  And اضا=ء signifies also اَصَابَ ضَوْءًا [&lt;i&gt;He saw&lt;/i&gt; (lit. &lt;i&gt;lighted on,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;found,&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;light,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;brightness&lt;/i&gt;].

      ضِوَا=ءٌ, (M, K,) the last of which is [erroneously] written in the L ضَوَا=ءٌ, (TA,) signify the same, (S, M, O, K,) i. e. &lt;i&gt;Light,&lt;/i&gt; syn. نُورٌ, (K, TA,) accord. to the leading lexicologists; but see what follows: (TA:) and ضَوْءٌ is an inf. n. of ضَا=ءَ, (S, M, O, Msb, K,) and so is ↓ <br>\
      ضُوْءٌ, (S, O, K,) or this is a simple subst. from ضَا=ءَ, and so is ↓ <br>\
      ضِيَا=ءٌ, which is also, sometimes, written ↓ <br>\
      ضِيَا=ءٌ, from اَضَا=ءَ as syn. with ضَا=ءَ: (Msb:) the pl. of ضَوْءٌ (M, TA) and ↓ <br>\
      ضُوْءٌ (M) is اَضْوَا=ءٌ; and ↓ <br>\
      ضِيَا=ءٌ is sometimes a pl., (M, TA,) as Zj states it to be: (TA:) some say that ضَوْءٌ has a more intensive signification than نُورٌ, and that hence God has likened his direction [the Kur-án] to النُّور rather than to الضَّوْء; because if it were otherwise, no one had erred: and that hence, also, [in the Kur x. 5,] the sun is termed ↓ <br>\
      ضِيَا=ء; and the moon, نُورٌ: it is also said that ضَوْءٌ signifies the &lt;i&gt;rays that are diffused by what is termed&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  نُورٌ: the kádee Zekereeyà affirms that these two words are syn. by their original application, but that ضَوْءٌ is more forcible accord. to usage: and some say that الضَّوْءُ signifies &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;light&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;which subsists by itself,&lt;/i&gt; as [that of] the sun, and fire; and النُّورُ, to that which subsists by some other thing [as does the light of the moon].
