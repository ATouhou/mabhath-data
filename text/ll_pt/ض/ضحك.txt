O,) inf. n. ضَحِكٌ and ضِحْكٌ (S, MA, O, Msb, K, KL) and ضَحْكٌ, (S, MA, O, K, KL,) the first of which is the superior form, (IDrd, O,) [the second and third being contractions thereof,] and ضِحِكٌ, (S, O, K, KL,) and if you said ضَحَكٌ it would be agreeable with analogy, (Az, TA,) <i>He laughed;</i> (MA, KL, PS, TK;) <i>contr. of</i> <br>\
                  بَكَى: (TK:) [see also 6:] الضَّحِكُ is well known, as meaning <i>the expanding of the face, and displaying of the teeth, by reason of happiness, joy,</i> or <i>gladness;</i> and التَّبَسُّمُ is the beginning thereof: thus in the Towsheeh and other works: (MF, TA:) and in like manner in the Mufradát [of Er-Rághib]; in which it is added that it is also used as meaning simply <i>the being happy, joyful,</i> or <i>glad:</i> and sometimes as meaning simply <i>the wondering</i> [at a thing]; and this is the meaning intended by him who says that it is peculiar to man: (TA:) [i. e.] ضَحِكَ, said of a man, signifies also <i>he wondered;</i> syn. عَجِبَ; (O, K, TA;) with مِنْ preposed to the object of wonder: (TA:) or <i>he was frightened;</i> or <i>he feared.</i> (K, TA.) You say, ضَحِكَ مِنْهُ and بِهِ, both meaning the same, (S, O, Msb,) i. e. <i>He laughed at him; derided him;</i> or <i>ridiculed him:</i> or <i>he wondered at him.</i> (Msb.) And ضَحِكَ اـِلَيْهِ [<i>He behaved laughingly,</i> or <i>cheerfully, towards him</i>]. (IDrd and K in art. بش [See بَشَّ لَهُ.]) ―         -b2-  Said of an ape, <i>He uttered a cry</i> or <i>cries:</i> (K:) or one says of the ape when he utters a cry or cries, يَضْحَكُ, (S, TA,) meaning <i>he displays his teeth,</i> or <i>grins.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  And ضَحِكَ السَّحَابُ (tropical:)  <i>The clouds lightened.</i> (S, O, K, TA.) Hence the usage of the verb in a trad. cited voce تَحَدَّثَ. (O, TA.) ―         -b4-  And ضَحِكَ الغَدِيرُ i. e. (tropical:)  [<i>The pool of water left by a torrent</i>] <i>glistened by reason of its fulness.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  [And ضَحِكَ ثَغْرُهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>His front teeth,</i> or <i>his teeth, glistened</i> by reason of his laughing; meaning <i>he laughed so as to show his front teeth,</i> or <i>his teeth.</i>] ―         -b6-  And ضَحِكَ الزَّهْرُ (tropical:)  <i>The flowers</i> [<i>looked gay,</i> or] <i>were as though they were laughing.</i> (TA.) And ضَحِكَتِ الاَرْضُ (tropical:)  <i>The earth,</i> or <i>land, put forth its plants,</i> or <i>herbage, and its flowers.</i> (TA.) And ضَحِكَتِ الرِّيَاضُ عَنِ الاَزْهَارِ (tropical:)  <i>The meadows,</i> or <i>gardens, displayed the flowers.</i> (TA.) ―         -b7-  And ضَحِكَتِ النَّخْلَةُ (tropical:)  <i>The palm-tree put forth</i> [or <i>disclosed</i>] <i>its</i> <br>\

                  طَلْع [or <i>spadix</i>], (O,) <i>burst open.</i> (Skr, O, TA.) And ضَحِكَ الطَّلْعُ (tropical:)  <i>The</i> <br>\
                  طلع [here app. meaning the <i>spathe of the palm-tree</i>] <i>split,</i> or <i>clave, open;</i> and so تَبَسَّمَ. (TA.) ―         -b8-  And, as some assert, (ISd, TA,) ضَحِكَتْ signifies also (tropical:)  <i>She menstruated;</i> said of a hare; (ISd, Z, O, Msb, TA;) accord. to some, from the ضَحَّاك [meaning the interior] of the طَلْعَة [of the palm-tree] when it bursts open; (ISd, TA;) and hence, (K, TA,) said also in this sense of a woman, (O, Msb, K, TA,) accord. to Mujáhid, (O, TA,) and some others, (TA,) in the Kur xi. 74, (O, K, TA,) where some read فَضَحَكَتْ, which is said to be a well-known dial. var.; (TA;) and likewise, accord. to some, said in this sense of the hyena, (O, TA,) when she sees blood, or as IAar says, when she eats the flesh of men and drinks their blood: (TA:) [it is commonly asserted by the Arabs that] the hare menstruates like women: (Kzw:) but with respect to this meaning as assigned to the verb in the Kur xi. 74, Fr says that he had not heard it from any person deserving of confidence; (O, TA; *) and Zj says that it is nought: both say that the meaning there is, <i>she laughed by reason of happiness:</i> (TA:) and some say that there is an inversion in this case, what is meant being فَبَشَّرْنَاهَا بِاـِسْحٰقَ <br>\
                  فَضَحِكَتْ: (Fr, O, TA:) or the meaning is, <i>she wondered;</i> so says I&#39;Ab; and so Er-Rághib, who adds that it is confirmed by her saying, “ shall I bring forth a child when I am an old woman, and this my husband is an old man? verily this is indeed a wonderful thing: ” and that فَحَاضَتْ which is inserted by some of the expositors after فَضَحِكَتْ is not an explanation of this expression, as some of them have imagined it to be, but is the mention of [a fact which was] a sign that the announcement was not that of an event improbable: or the meaning is, <i>she was frightened;</i> so says Fr.: (TA:) and with respect to the meaning of this verb when said of the hyena, mentioned above, it is rejected by AHát and others: (TA:) IDrd says, on the authority of AHát, respecting the following verse of TaäbbataSharrà, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> that the meaning is (assumed tropical:)  <i>The hyena displays her teeth,</i> or <i>grins, on account of the slain</i> [<i>of Hudheyl</i>], when she sees them, like as they say of the ass when he plucks out the [plant called] صِلِّيَانَة; (O, TA;) or, as others say, (assumed tropical:)  <i>the hyena snarls, displaying her teeth; and sees the wolf raising his voice in calling</i> the [other] wolves <i>to them,</i> i. e. to the slain: (O, TA:*) Abu-l-&#39; Abbás says that the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  <i>the hyena displays her teeth,</i> because the wolf contends with her over the slain: and some say that the poet means, (assumed tropical:)  <i>the hyena rejoices because of the slain.</i> (TA.) ―         -b9-  One says also, ضَحِكَتِ <br>\
                  السَّمُرَةُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>The</i> <br>\
                  سمرة [or <i>gum-acacia-tree</i>] <i>flowed with its gum:</i> from ضحكت meaning “ she menstruated. ” (Bd in xi. 74.)    </entryFree> <br>\
