                   is an indecl. word with fet-h for its termination, like كَيْفَ, and means دَعْ [<i>Let alone,</i> or <i>say nothing of</i>]; (S;) [i. e.] it is a noun for دَعْ; indecl.; (Mughnee, K;) a verbal noun, meaning دَعْ and اُتْرُكْ; (IAth, TA;) and the noun that  follows it, when it is thus used, is in the accus. case; (Mughnee, K;) i. e. it is indecl., with fet-h for its termination, when the noun following it is in the accus. case; so that you say, بَلْهَ زَيْدًا [<i>Let alone Zeyd,</i> or <i>say nothing of Zeyd</i>]; like as you say, رُوَيْدَ زَيْدًا: (IB, TA:) and it is also an inf. n. in the sense of التَّرْكُ; likewise with fet-h for its termination, but decl.; and when it is thus used, the noun that follows it is in the gen. case; (Mughnee, K;) or it is put in the place of an inf. n., meaning تَرْكَ [which is virtually the same as اُتْرُكْ and دَعْ], and is prefixed to a noun in the gen. case; so that you say, بَلْهَ زَيْدٍ, i. e. تَرْكَ زَيْدٍ [which is virtually the same as بَلْهَ زَيْدًا explained above; for تَرْكَ زَيْدٍ is originally اُتْرُكْ زَيْدًا تَرْكًا, like as فَضَرْبَ الرِّقَابِ in the Kur xlvii. 4 is originally فاْضْرِبُوا الرِّقَابَ <br>\
                  ضَرْبًا]; (IAth, TA;) for in this case it cannot be regarded as a verbal noun, since verbal nouns are not prefixed to other nouns, governed by them in the gen. case: (IB, TA:) and it is also a noun syn. with كَيْفَ [<i>How?</i>]; likewise with fet-h for its termination, indecl.; and when it is thus used, the noun that follows it is in the nom. case.

                  </quote> [<i>They leave the skulls with their crowns lying open to the sun (let alone,</i> or <i>say nothing of, the hands) as though they had not been created</i>]: (S, Mughnee:) he says, when they cut, or cut off, the crowns, then let alone, or say nothing of, the hands (فَدَعِ الاَكُفَّ): i. e., they are more fit for cutting off the hands: (TA:) Akh says that بله is here in the place of an inf. n.; that it is as when you say, ضَرْبَ زَيْدٍ: but الاكفّ may be in the accus. case; so that the meaning may be دَعِ الاَكُفَّ: (S:) the verse is thus recited in two different ways: and also بَلْهَ الاَكُفُّ [<i>how</i> then must be the case of <i>the hands?</i>]. (Mughnee.) And hence the prov., تُحْرِقُكَ النَّارُ اـِنْ تَرَاهَا بَلْهَ اَنْ <br>\
                  تَصْلَاهَا, i. e. <i>The fire will burn thee if thou see it</i> from a distance: <i>then let alone,</i> or <i>say nothing of,</i> (فَدَعْ,) <i>thy entering into it.</i> (TA.) A strange instance occurs in the Saheeh of El-Bukháree, in the explanation of the ا=ل=م= of the chapter of السَّجْدَة [the 32nd ch. of the Kur]: he says, God says [by these three letters], اَعْدَدْتُ لِعِبَادِي <br>\
                  الصَّالِحِينَ مَا لَا عَيْنٌ رَاَتْ وَلَا اُذُنٌ سَمِعَتْ وَ لَا خَطَرِ <br>\
                  عَلَى قَلْبِ بَشَرٍ ذُخْرًا مِنْ بَلْهِ مَا اْطَّلَعْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ: (Mughnee, K: *) or ما اَطَلَعْتُهُمْ عَلَيْهِ: (so in some copies of the K:) thus بله is used as a decl. word, governed in the gen. case by من, and deviating from the three meanings [explained above]: (Mughnee, K:) but the reading commonly known is, على قلب بشر بَلْهَ مَ اَطْلَعْتُهُمْ عليه; and this is the reading in the work of J, [the S,] and in the Nh, and other lexicological works: (TA:) it has been explained by غَيْر; [so that the meaning of the sentence as first related above is, <i>I have prepared for my righteous servants what eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it occurred to the mind of man, as a treasure for the future,</i> (obviously taken from Isaiah lxiv. 4, quoted by St. Paul in 1 Cor. ii. 9,) <i>save,</i> or <i>except, that with which ye have become acquainted,</i> or <i>that with which I have acquainted them;</i> and the same, with the omission of “ as a treasure for the future, “ is the meaning of the sentence as related in the S and Nh &amp;amp;c.;] (Mughnee, K;) i. e. سِوَى, as in the S; (TA;) and this corroborates, (Mughnee,) or is agreeable with, (K,) the opinion of those who reckon بله as an exceptive word: (Mughnee, K:) and as meaning اَجَلْ [app. a mistranscription for اَجْل; i. e., it has been explained also as meaning I have done all this because of my promise to them; (مِنْ اَجْلِ مَا اَطْلَعْتُهُمْ عَلَيْهِ <br>\
                  <i>because of that with which I have acquainted them;</i>) and thus it may have been read by SM, for he has written اجل without any syll. signs; and has given no other ex. of بله in the sense here intended except one commencing with the words, بَلْهَ انِّى لَمْ اَخُنْ <br>\
                  عَهْدًا, which may mean <i>because I have not broken a covenant,</i> or <i>yea, verily I have not</i> &amp;amp;c., accord. as we read اَنِّى or اـِنِّى]: or as meaning كُفَّ [or rather كُفَّ عَنْ] and دَعْ [<i>let alone,</i> or <i>say nothing of;</i> but this explanation must relate to the sentence as given in the S and Nh]: (K, but omitted in an excellent copy of that work:) or, accord. to El-Ahmar, it means, in this trad. [as commonly known], كَيُفَ [<i>how?</i> which seems to be the least suitable of all these explanations]. (TA.) IAmb relates, on the authority of others, that بَلْهَ is also <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  عَلَى: [but I think that this is a mistake, arising from a misunderstanding of what here follows:] Fr says that he who makes it to govern a gen. case regards it as used in the manner of عَلَى, and similar particles governing the gen. case. (TA.) ―         -b2-  مَا بَلْهَكَ means مَا بَالُكَ [<i>What is thy state,</i> or <i>condition,</i> or <i>case?</i>]: (K, TA:) or مَا لَكَ [which often has this meaning: see the letter ل].
