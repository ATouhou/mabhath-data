                     بَدَاَ<br>\
                  , (Mgh, K,) inf. n. بَدْءٌ, (T, S, M, Msb,) i. q. به ↓ <br>\
      ابتدا; (S, Msb, K;) [<i>He began with it;</i>] <i>he made it to have precedence,</i> or <i>to be first; gave precedence to it;</i> syn. قَدَّمَهُ: (Mgh, Msb:) in the dial. of the Ansár, بَدِيَ به is used in this sense of قدّمه; (M;) or بَدِىَ به [without ء]; (IKtt, TA; [see بَدةءٌ;]) [and بَدَى به; see art. بدى;] and به ↓ <br>\
      ابدا signifies the same. (Msb.) [So in the Kur xii. 76, فَبَدَاَ بِاَوْعِيَتِهِمْ قَبْلَ وِعَا=ءِ اَخِيهِ <br>\
                  <i>And he began with their bags, before the bags of his brother.</i> And بَدَاَهُ is sometimes used in the sense of بَدَاَ بِهِ; whence, in the Kur ix. 13, وَهُمْ بَدَوُوكُمْ اَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ <br>\
                  <i>And they,</i> it was, <i>began with you the first time;</i> i. e., as Bd says, by acting with hostility, and fighting.] You say also, بَدَّا ثُمَّ عَادَ <br>\
                  <i>He began,</i> or <i>did a first time,</i> or <i>the first time: then repeated,</i> or <i>did a second time.</i> (Az, TA in art. عود.) And بَدَاَ فِىِ الاَمْرِ [<i>He began,</i> or <i>made a beginning, in the affair.</i>] (M.) ―         -b2-  بَدَاَ also signifies <i>It</i> (a thing) <i>began; began to be; originated;</i> or <i>came into existence.</i> (Msb.) [See also 5.]       -A2-  بَدَاَ الشَّيْءَ, (S, M, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (M,) [<i>He began the thing; commenced it; set about it;</i> as  also ↓ <br>\
      ابتداهُ: accord. to the Mgh, the latter has this meaning, or, agreeably with the authority of the M and K, the meaning which here next follows:] <i>he did the thing first, for the first time, by way of beginning,</i> or <i>originally;</i> (S, M, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      ابداهُ and ↓ <br>\
      ابتداهُ; (M, K;) i. e., <i>not after the example of anything preceding.</i> (TA. [But this addition seems rather to belong to another explanation to be mentioned below.]) One does not say, زَيْدًا ↓ <br>\
      ابتدا nor بَدَاَهُ, because these two verbs [signifying as last explained above] do not have for their objects corporeal things. (Mgh.) [El-Mutanakhkhil El-Hudhalee uses the phrase سَاَبْدُوُهُمْ بِمَشْمَعِةٍ <br>\
                  <i>I will begin with them</i> (meaning his guests) <i>by sporting and jesting;</i> like the phrase in the Kur ix. 13 cited above: but different from these is the saying in the Kur xxxii. 6, وَبَدَاَ خَلْقِ اْلْاـِنْسَانِ مِنْ طِينٍ <br>\
                  <i>And He began the creation of man from clay.</i>] The saying, ↓ <br>\
      فَاـِنْ كَانَ السَّبُعُ اْبْتَدَاَهُ means ابتدا اَخْذَهُ <br>\
                  اَوْ عَضَّهُ [<i>But if the beast,</i> or <i>bird, of prey has begun the seizing of him, or the biting of him</i>]; the noun that is prefixed [to the pronoun] being suppressed. (Mgh.) You say also, كَانَ ذٰلِكَ فِى <br>\

      اْبْتِدَا=ءِ <br>\
                  <i>That was in the beginning,</i> or <i>first, of the affair.</i> (Msb.) [See also بَدْءٌ, below.] ―         -b2-  <i>He originated the thing; brought it into being</i> or <i>existence; made it,</i> or <i>produced it, for the first time, it not having been before;</i> (Mgh;) [and] so ↓ <br>\
      ابداهُ, said [of God, and] of a man, as the agent; (Msb;) and ↓ <br>\
      ابتداهُ. (Mgh in art. بدع.) [Hence,] بَدَاَ اْللّٰهُ الخَلْقَ, and ↓ <br>\
      اَبْدَاَهُمْ, <i>God created,</i> or <i>brought into existence, mankind,</i> or <i>the created beings:</i> (M, Msb, K:) both signify the same. (S.) البَاطِلُ وَمَا يُعِيدُ ↓ <br>\
      مَا يُبْدِيُ [in the Kur xxxiv. 48, means <i>What doth that which is false,</i> or <i>the Devil, originate,</i> or <i>produce in the first instance? and what doth it,</i> or <i>he, reproduce</i> after it hath perished?]: Zj says that مَا, here, is in the place of an accus., meaning in each Instance اَىَّ شَىْءٍ: or it may be a negative; and الباطل here is Iblees; i. e., <i>Iblees createth not, nor raiseth to life</i> after death. (M.) You say also, وَمَا يُعِيدُ ↓ <br>\
      مَا يُبْدِيُ, meaning وَلَا ↓ <br>\
      مَا يَتَكَلَّمُ <br>\
                  عَايِدَةٍ, (S, K,) i. e. <i>He does not say anything for the first time, nor anything for the second time;</i> or <i>anything original, nor anything in the way of repetition;</i> <br>\
                  الكَلَامِ ↓ <br>\
      بَادِيَةُ signifying <i>what is said for the first time;</i> and عَايِدَةُ الكَلَامِ, <i>what is said for the second time, afterwards:</i> (TA:) or <i>he says not anything:</i> (A in art. عود:) and <i>he has no art, artifice,</i> or <i>cunning.</i> (IAar, TA in art. عود; and A in the present art.) ―         -b3-  بَدَاَ البِيْرَ <br>\
                  <i>He dug the well</i> [<i>for the first time:</i> see بَدِىْءٌ]. (Msb.)       -A3-  بَدَاَ مِنْ اَرْضٍ اـِلَى اَرْضٍ, (T,) or مِنْ اَرْضِهِ, (K,) <i>He went forth from a land to a land,</i> or <i>from his land;</i> as also ↓ <br>\

                  حصبة: (T:) or, as Lh says, <i>there came forth upon him pustules resembling the small-pox:</i> but he adds, some say, <i>the small-pox itself:</i> (M:) the epithet applied to a person affected therewith is ↓ <br>\
      مَبْدُوْءٌ. (AZ, As, Lh, T, S, M.) ―         -b2-  Also <i>He fell sick.</i> (IAth, TA.) In a trad. of &#39; Áïsheh occur the words, فِى اليَوْمِ <br>\
                  الَّذِى بُدِيَ فِيهِ رَسُولِ اْللّٰهِ [meaning <i>In the day in which the Apostle of God fell sick</i>]: and IAth says, مَتَى بُدِيَ فُلَانٌ meaning <i>When did such a one fall sick?</i> is a phrase used in inquiring respecting the living [who has been attacked by illness] and respecting the dead.

      البَدْءُ بَدِىْءٌ; and البَدِىءُ being syn. with الاَوَّلُ. (S, K.) Hence the saying, اِفْعَلْهُ بَادِى بَدْءٍ, and ↓ <br>\
