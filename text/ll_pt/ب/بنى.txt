      بنّاهُ; (M, K;) or the last has teshdeed given to it to denote muchness, or frequency, or repetition, of the action, or its application to many objects; and hence you say, بنّى قُصُورًا [<i>He built palaces,</i> or <i>pavilions:</i> or <i>he raised them high:</i> see the pass. part. n. below]. (S, TA.) AHn speaks of a kind of plank as being used فِى بِنَا=ءِ السُّفُنِ [<i>in the construction of ships</i>]: but بِنَا=ءٌ is originally used only in relation to that which does not grow; as stone, and clay, and the like.

(Msb.) [See also بَيْتٌ.] ―         -b3-  بِنَايَةٌ is sometimes used in relation to nobility: (M, K:) and the verb thus used is بَنَى, as above, (T, M,) having [also] بِنًى for its inf. n., (IAar, T,) and بِنَا=ءٌ; held by many to be tropical, but by some to be proper.

                  <i>I saw thy daughters;</i> but sometimes] one says, رَاَيْتُ بَنَاتَكَ, with fet-h [as the case-ending], treating the ت as a radical letter. (S.) It is said in the Bári&#39; that when men and women are mixed together, the masc. pl. is made predominant; so that one says, بَنُو <br>\

(Msb.) ―         -b2-  When اِبْن is applied to that which is not a human being, (IAmb, Msb,) to an irrational being, (Msb,) it has for its pl. بَنَات: (IAmb, Msb:) thus the pl. of اِبْنُ مَخَاضٍ [<i>A young male camel in his second year</i>] is بَنَاتُ مَخَاضٍ: (Mgh, Msb:) that of اِبْنُ <br>\
                  لَبُونٍ [<i>A male camel that has entered upon his third year</i>] is بَنَاتُ لَبُونٍ: (Msb:) and that of اِبْنُ نَعْشٍ [<i>Any one of the stars of the tail of Ursa Major</i> or <i>of that of Ursa Minor</i>] is بَنَاتُ نَعْشٍ; but sometimes, by poetic licence, بَنُو نَعْشٍ: and hence, or to make a distinction between the males and the females, the lawyers say, بَنُو اللَّبُونِ.

      بَنَاتٌ also signifies (tropical:)  <i>Dolls with which young girls play:</i> (S, Mgh, K:) sing. بِنْتٌ. (Mgh.)

(Mgh.) ―         -b4-  اِبْن is often prefixed to some other noun (T, M, Msb) that particularizes its signification, because of a close connexion between the two meanings: (Msb:) and so is ↓ <br>\

      اُبَيْنُونَ; and he cites a verse in which occurs the expression اُبَيْنِيكَ, [in the gen. case, meaning <i>thy little sons,</i>] and adds, it is as though its sing. were اـِبْنٌ, with the disjunctive ا, whence the dim. ↓ <br>\
      اُبَيْنٌ, in the pl. اُبَيْنُونَ: but he should have said, as though its sing. were اَبْنَى, like اَعْمَى, originally اَبْنَوُ. (IB, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
