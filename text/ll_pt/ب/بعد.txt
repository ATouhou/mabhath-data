                   an adv. n. of time, signifying <i>After,</i> or <i>afterwards:</i> and allowable also, accord. to some of the grammarians, as an adv. n. of place, signifying <i>after,</i> or <i>behind:</i> (TA:) <i>contr. of</i> <br>\
                  قَبْلُ: (S, A, K:) it is a vague adv. n., of which the meaning is not understood without its being prefixed to another noun [expressed or implied]; denoting after-time. (Msb.) When it occurs without any complement, (S, K,) a noun or the like which should be its complement being intended to be understood as to the meaning thereof but not as to the letter, (S, * TA,) it is indecl., (S, K,) because it resembles a particle, (TA,) and has damm for its termination to show that it is indecl., since it cannot have damm by any rule of desinential syntax because it cannot occur as an agent nor as an inchoative or enunciative. (S.) Sb, however, mentions [as exceptions to this rule] the phrases مِنْ بَعْدٍ [<i>Afterwards</i>] and اَفْعَلُ هٰذَا بَعْدًا [<i>I will do this afterwards</i>], as having been used by the Arabs. (K, * TA.) [The latter of these phrases is common in the present day. Another exception to the rule above-mentioned will be found in what follows.] Accord. to the primary rule, it is used as a prefixed n. governing its complement in the gen. case; (S;) [i. e., it is used in the manner of a preposition;] and when thus used, it is decl., (K,) because it does not in this case [always] resemble a particle.

The words of the Kur [xxx. 3], اْللّٰهِ اْلْاَمْرُ مِنْ قَبْلُ وَ مِنْ بَعْدُ, meaning <i>To God</i> belonged <i>the command before</i> that the Greeks were overcome <i>and after</i> that they had been overcome, [thus read when the complements of قبل and بعد are intended to be understood as to the meaning thereof but not as to the letter,] are also read مِنْ قَبْلِ وَ مِنْ بَعْدِ, when each complement is intended to be understood as to the meaning and the letter, and also مِنْ قَبْلٍ وَ مِنْ بَعْدٍ, meaning To God belongeth the command <i>first and last,</i> [when neither complement is intended to be understood either as to the letter or as to the meaning,] but the first of these readings is the best. (L.) [You say also, بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ and مِنْ <br>\

      بُعَيْدَات is used only as an adv. n. of time. (S, L.) ―         -b3-  بَعْدُ also sometimes means <i>Now; yet; as yet.</i> (TA.) [It is used in this sense mostly in negative phrases; as, for instance, in لَمْ يَمُتْ بَعْدُ <br>\
