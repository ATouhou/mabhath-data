                  <i>of a man;</i> (AZ, As, T, S, M, K;) [in the Lex. of Golius, as on the authority of the S, and in that of Freytag, <i>idem quod</i> <br>\

                  <i>in homine;</i> but this is a mistake, app. occasioned by a mistranscription in a copy of the S;] and the مِخْلَب is its claw, i. e., nail: (AZ, As, T, S:) or the <i>paw</i> (كَفّ), (M, K,) <i>altogether,</i> (M,) <i>with the</i> <br>\
                  اَصَابِع [or <i>toes</i>]: (M, K:) or the <i>claw,</i> i. e. <i>nail,</i> of the lion, (Lth, T, M, K,) likened to the instrument for perforating leather; (Lth, T;) and of [all] animals of prey, and of birds that do not prey, <i>corresponding to the</i> <br>\
                  ظُفْر <br>\
                  <i>of man:</i> Th says, of man, it is [termed] the ظُفْر; of animals having the kind of foot called خُفّ, the مَنْسِمْ; of solidhoofed animals, the حَافِر; of cloven-hoofed animals, the ظِلْف; of beasts and birds of prey, the مِخْلَب; and of birds that do not prey, and of dogs and the like, the بُرْثُن; though it may be also used [in like manner] of all animals of prey: (Msb:) [but properly] it is of birds that do not prey, as the crow-kind, and the pigeon; (M;) and sometimes, of the [lizard called] ضَبّ, (S, M,) and of the rat, or mouse, and of the jerboa: (M:) and is, in the pl. form, (M, TA,) which is بَرَاثِنُ, (T, S, M, TA,) metaphorically applied, by Sá&#39;ideh Ibn-Jueiyeh, to the <i>fingers</i> of a man gathering honey [deposited by wild bees in a hollow of a rock].

(assumed tropical:)  [The <i>claw,</i> or] the <i>claws;</i> meaning thereby their impetuous valour, and strength: but برثمة may be a dial. var. of برثنة, or the م may be substituted for the ن for the purpose of assimilation [to برجمة].
