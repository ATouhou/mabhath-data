                  زَالَ [in two senses; i. e. as an attributive verb, and also as a non-attributive verb; as will be shown by what follows]. (S, A, Mgh.) [Using it as an attributive verb,] you say, لَا اَبْرَحُ حَتَّى تَقْضِىَ حَاجَتِى <br>\
                  <i>I will not go away,</i> or <i>depart,</i> or <i>withdraw,</i> (لَا اَزُولٌ, and لَا اَتَنَحَّىِ,) <i>until thou accomplish my want:</i> from بَرِحَ المَكَانُ, inf. n. بَرَاحٌ, <i>he went away,</i> or <i>departed, from the place;</i> syn. زَالَ مِنْهُ: and to be distinguished from the phrase in the Kur [xviii. 59, similar as to words,] mentioned below. (Mgh.) You say, بَرِحَ مَكَانَهُ, (S, A, L, K,) aor.      <br>\

                  , (K,) inf. n. بَرَاحٌ (S, L, K) and بُرُوحٌ (L, TA, and Ham p. 250) and بَرَحٌ, (L,) or بَرْحٌ, (as in a copy of the TA,) <i>He went away,</i> or <i>departed, from his place;</i> (S, L, K, and Ham ubi suprà;) and <i>he became in the</i> <br>\

      تبرّح. (L.) In the phrase لَا بَرَاحَ [<i>There is,</i> or <i>shall be, no quitting of place,</i> or <i>going away,</i> or <i>departing</i>], the noun is in the accus. case, as in لَا رَيْبَ: but it is allowable to put it in the nom. case, so that لا is used in the manner of لَيْسَ; (S, K;) as in the following saying of Saad Ibn-Málik, [in the TA, in one place, Ibn-Náshib,] in a poem of which the rhyme is with refa, (S, IAth,) alluding to El-Hárith Ibn-&#39;Abbád, who had withdrawn himself from the war of Teghlib and Bekr the sons of Wáïl: (IAth, TA:) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  <i>the fires of the war,</i>) let him do so: <i>but</i> as for me, <i>I am the son of Keys:</i> to me <i>there is not,</i> or <i>shall not be, any quitting of place</i>]. (S, IAth. [See also Ham p. 250, where, for مَن فَرَّ, we find مَنْ صَدَّ <br>\
                  <i>whoso turneth away.</i>]) [Hence,] بَرِحَتِ <br>\
                  الرِّيحُ بِالتُّرَابِ <br>\
                  <i>The wind carried up, raised,</i> or <i>swept up and scattered,</i> [lit. <i>went away with,</i>] <i>the dust.</i> (Msb.) [Hence also, accord. to some,] بَرِحَ الخَفَا=ءُ, (T, S, K, &amp;amp;c.,) and بَرَحَ, (Ibn-ElLihyánee, Z, and TA, [thus written in a copy of the A,]) (tropical:)  <i>The state of concealment departed,</i> or <i>ceased:</i> or (tropical:)  <i>what was in a state of concealment became apparent;</i> from بَرَاحٌ meaning “what is open and apparent” of land: or (tropical:)  <i>what I was concealing became apparent:</i> (T, TA:) or (tropical:)  <i>the affair,</i> or <i>case, became manifest,</i> (S, A, K,) and <i>its concealment ceased,</i> (A,) [or] <i>as though the secret departed, and ceased:</i> (S:) or, as some say, (assumed tropical:)  <i>the secret became apparent:</i> (TA in art. خفى:) or, lit., <i>the low ground became high and apparent;</i> meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>what was concealed became revealed:</i> (Har pp. 133—4:) the first who said it was Shikk the Diviner. (IDrd, TA.) ―         -b2-  [Using it as a non-attributive verb,] you say, لَا اَبْرَحُ <br>\
                  اَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ <br>\
                  <i>I will not cease,</i> or <i>I will continue,</i> (لَا اَزَالُ,) <i>to do that:</i> (S, A: *) and مَا بَرِحَ يَفْعَلُ <br>\

                  زَيْدٌ قَايِمًا [<i>Zeyd ceased not to be,</i> or <i>he kept,</i> or <i>continued, standing</i>]: in this case, the verb is of the category of كَانَ; (Mgh;) relates to time; and requires a predicate: and its inf. n. is بَرَاحٌ. (Ham p. 250.) Hence the saying in the Kur [xviii. 59], لَا اَبْرَاحُ حَتَّى اَبْلُغَ مَجْمَعَ البَحْرَيْنِ, but the predicate is suppressed: it may be مَا نَحْنُ <br>\
                  فِيهِ كَذٰلِكَ [i. e. <i>I will not cease in that wherein we are thus engaged until I reach the place of meeting of the two seas</i>]: (Mgh:) or it means لَا اَزَالُ <br>\
                  اَسِيرُ [<i>I will not cease journeying</i>]: (Bd, Jel:) or لا ابرح here may mean <i>I will not depart</i> (لَا اَزُولُ) <i>from that upon which I am intent,</i> namely journeying and seeking; and <i>I will not relinquish it;</i> so that it does not require the predicate.
