(M.) ―         -b3-  بَا=ءَ بِاـِثْمِهِ, aor. and inf. n. as above, (T, S,) signifies, accord. to Akh, &lt;i&gt;He returned&lt;/i&gt; [laden] &lt;i&gt;with his sin:&lt;/i&gt; (S:) or, accord. to As, &lt;i&gt;he acknowledged it,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;confessed it:&lt;/i&gt; (T:) or, accord. to others, (TA,) بَا=ءَ بِذَنْبِهِ, (T, * M, Msb, K,) aor. as above, inf. n. بَوْءٌ and بَوَا=ءٌ, (M, K,) &lt;i&gt;he bore,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;took upon himself, the burden of his sin,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;crime,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;offence;&lt;/i&gt; syn. اِحْتَمَلَهُ; (Aboo-Is-hák, T, M, K, TA;) &lt;i&gt;and became&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;as though he were&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;the abiding-place thereof:&lt;/i&gt; (TA:) or &lt;i&gt;he became burdened,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;laden, with it:&lt;/i&gt; (Msb:) or &lt;i&gt;he became,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;made himself, answerable, responsible,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;accountable, for it, by an inseparable obligation;&lt;/i&gt; syn. اِلْتَزَمَ بِهِ; for the primary signification of بَوَا=ءٌ is [asserted to be] لُزُومٌ [i. e. &lt;i&gt;adhesion,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.]; and it is afterwards used in every case [so as to imply a meaning of this kind] according to the exigency of that case; as is said in the Nh, and expressly stated by Z and Er-Rághib: (TA:) or &lt;i&gt;he acknowledged it,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;confessed it.&lt;/i&gt; (M, K.) اـِنِّى اُرِيدُ اَنْ تَبُوْءَ بِاـِثْمِى <br>\
                  وَ اـِثْمِكَ, in the Kur v. 35, means &lt;i&gt;Verily I desire that thou return&lt;/i&gt; [laden] &lt;i&gt;with the sin committed against me&lt;/i&gt; in slaying me, &lt;i&gt;and thy sin&lt;/i&gt; which thou hast committed previously: (Jel:) or &lt;i&gt;I desire that thou shouldst bear&lt;/i&gt; (تَحْمِلَ) &lt;i&gt;my sin&lt;/i&gt; if I were to extend my hand towards thee, &lt;i&gt;and thy sin&lt;/i&gt; in extending thy hand towards me: or &lt;i&gt;the sin committed against me&lt;/i&gt; in slaying me, &lt;i&gt;and thy sin&lt;/i&gt; for which thine offering was not accepted: and each noun is in the place of a denotative of state; i. e., [it means] &lt;i&gt;that thou return involved in the two sins; bearing them:&lt;/i&gt; and perhaps the speaker may have meant, if that must inevitably take place, I desire that it may be thine act, not mine; so that the real meaning is, that it should not be his, not that it should be his brother&#39;s: or by the اـِثْمٌ may be meant the &lt;i&gt;punishment&lt;/i&gt; thereof; for the desire of the punishment of the disobedient is allowable: (Bd:) accord. to Th, the meaning is, if thou have determined upon slaying me, the sin will be in thee, not in me. (M.) فَبَاوُوا بِغَضَبٍ عَلَى غَضَبٍ <br>\
                  &lt;pb n=&quot;271&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; [in the Kur ii. 84] is explained by Aboo-Is-hák as meaning &lt;i&gt;So they bore the burden of anger upon anger;&lt;/i&gt; syn. اِحْتَمَلُوا; this being said by him to be the proper signification of the verb: or, as some say, the meaning is, [&lt;i&gt;they bore the burden of&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;sin for which they deserved the fire&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;of Hell&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;following upon sin for which they deserved the same:&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;they returned&lt;/i&gt; [laden &lt;i&gt;with anger upon anger&lt;/i&gt;]: (T:) or &lt;i&gt;they became deserving of anger upon anger.&lt;/i&gt; (Ksh.) [See a similar phrase, also from the Kur, above.] It is said in a form of prayer, اَبُوْءُ اـِلَيْكَ بِنِعْمَتِكَ, meaning &lt;i&gt;I acknowledge,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;confess, to Thee thy favour&lt;/i&gt; [towards me, as imposing an obligation upon me]. (Mgh.) You say also, بَا=ءٌ بِحَقِّهِ; (S;) and بِدِّمِهِ; (M, K;) &lt;i&gt;He acknowledged,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;confessed,&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;himself to be answerable, responsible,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;accountable, for&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;his right, due,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;just claim;&lt;/i&gt; (S;) and so [&lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;his blood:&lt;/i&gt; (M, K:) the verb expresses acknowledgment, or confession, always of something for which its agent is, as it were, indebted, or answerable; not the contrary. (S.) ―         -b4-  بَا=ءَ بِكَفِّى, in a poem of Sakhr-el-Gheí, means &lt;i&gt;It&lt;/i&gt; [referring to a sword] &lt;i&gt;became in my hand; my hand became to it a&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  مَبَا=ءَة, i. e. مَاْوًى [or &lt;i&gt;place of abode&lt;/i&gt;]; &lt;i&gt;it returned, and became in my hand:&lt;/i&gt; or, accord. to Ibn- Habeeb, &lt;i&gt;i. q.&lt;/i&gt; <br>\

(Skr p. 16.)       -A2-  بَا=ءٌ also signifies &lt;i&gt;It&lt;/i&gt; (a thing, TA) &lt;i&gt;suited, matched, tallied, corresponded,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;agreed.&lt;/i&gt; (K.) [Hence,] بَا=ءَ فُلَانٌ بِفُلَانٍ (inf. n. بَوَا=ءٌ, TA) &lt;i&gt;Such a one was the like,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;equal, of such a one, to be slain&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;in retaliation&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;for him:&lt;/i&gt; (T:) or &lt;i&gt;became his like,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;equal, so that he was slain&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;in retaliation&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;for him:&lt;/i&gt; (Mgh:) and &lt;i&gt;was slain for him,&lt;/i&gt; (AZ, T, S,) &lt;i&gt;and his blood became a compensation for the blood of the other:&lt;/i&gt; (T:) or &lt;i&gt;was deserving of being,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;fit to be, slain in retaliation for him,&lt;/i&gt; (Ksh and Bd in ii. 58,) &lt;i&gt;because his equal:&lt;/i&gt; (Ksh ibid.:) or &lt;i&gt;was slain for him, and so became equal with him;&lt;/i&gt; (K, * TA;) as also ↓ <br>\

                  &lt;i&gt;&#39;Arári became slain for Kahl:&lt;/i&gt; these were two cows, which smote each other with their horns, and both died: the proverb is applied to any two that become equal.
