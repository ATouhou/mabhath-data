You say, لَقِيتُ بِزَيْدٍ بَحْرًا (tropical:)  [<i>I found, in the place of Zeyd, a man of abundant generosity</i> or <i>beneficence</i>]: ب here denoting substitution. (The Lubáb cited in the TA voce بِ.)

                  <i>and in the land of seed-produce and fruitfulness;</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (Aboo-&#39;Alee, TA:) or the meaning here is, [<i>in the desert,</i> or <i>deserts, and in the towns,</i> or <i>villages, in which is water:</i> (see بَرٌّ:) or <i>in the open country and</i>] <i>in the cities</i> [or <i>towns</i>] <i>upon the rivers;</i> by sterility in the former, and scarcity in the latter: (Zj, TA, and T in art. بر:) or <i>in the land and the sea;</i> i. e., the land has become sterile, or unfruitful, and the supply of the sea has become cut off.
