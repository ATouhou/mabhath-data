                  , (Msb, K,) inf. n. بُكَا=ءٌ and بُكًا (S, Msb, K) and مَبْكًى, (Har p. 11,) <i>He wept; i. e. he lamented,</i> or <i>grieved, shedding tears at the same time;</i> and <i>he lamented,</i> or <i>grieved,</i> alone; and <i>he shed tears</i> alone: (Er-Rághib, TA:) accord. to some, the preferable opinion is, that there is no difference between بُكَا=ءُ and بُكًا: (TA:) or the former means the <i>crying,</i> or <i>uttering of the voice</i> [<i>of lamentation</i>], (S, IKtt, Msb, TA, &amp;amp;c.,) <i>that accompanies</i> <br>\
                  البُكَا=ء [so in copies of the S and in the TA, but correctly البُكَا]; (S, IKtt, TA;) and the latter (بُكًا), the <i>shedding of tears:</i> (S, IKtt, Msb, TA, &amp;amp;c.:) or the former, i. e. with medd, means the <i>shedding of tears by reason of lamentation,</i> or <i>grief, and raising of the voice, or crying,</i> [<i>at the same time,</i>] <i>when the voice is predominant,</i> being like رُغَا=ءٌ, and ثُغَا=ءٌ and other words of the same form applied to denote the uttering of a cry or of the voice; and the latter, [the <i>shedding of tears &amp;amp;c.</i>] <i>when lamentation,</i> or <i>grief, is predominant:</i> (Er-Rághib, TA:) or by the former is meant the <i>crying,</i> or <i>uttering of the voice</i> [<i>of lamentation</i>]; and by the latter, the <i>lamenting,</i> or <i>grieving.</i> (Kh, TA.) تَبْكَا=ءٌ and تِبْكَا=ءٌ [may be inf. ns. of بَكَى or of ↓ <br>\
      بَكَّى, and] signify <i>the same as</i> <br>\
                  بُكَا=ءٌ: or <i>much</i> <br>\
                  بُكَاء [or <i>weeping,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (K:) MF asserts that تِبْكَا=ءٌ (with kesr) and the former of these explanations are unknown; but both the word and the explanation are mentioned by Lh, as used in a form of words uttered by Arab women of the desert to fascinate men: ISd, however, says that it should be تَبْكَا=ء, because it is an inf. n. of a class formed to denote muchness [of the attribute signified by the verb], like تَهْذَارٌ and تَلْعَابٌ &amp;amp;c.; and IAar says that تَبْكَاءٌ, with fet-h, has the latter of the two significations assigned to it above. (TA.) [See what is said of the measure تِفْعَالٌ voce بَيَّنَ.] You say, بَكَى لَهُ (MF, TA) and بَكَى عَلَيْهِ, (S, Msb, K, MF,) meaning [<i>He wept</i>] <i>for,</i> or <i>over, him,</i> or <i>it:</i> and only بَكَى بِهِ [or thus and also بَكَىمِنْهُ as appears from what follows] when meaning [<i>He wept</i>] <i>because,</i> or <i>in consequence, of it:</i> (&#39;Ináyeh, MF, TA:) and بَكَاهُ and ↓ <br>\
      بَكَّاهُ, (As, AZ, S, Msb, K,) inf. n. of the former بُكَا=ءٌ (K) [and بُكًا], and of the latter تَبْكِيَةٌ, (TA,) signify <i>the same as</i> <br>\
                  بَكَى <br>\
                  عَلَيْهِ; (As, AZ, S, Msb, * K;) the object being a man: (As, S:) and (or as some say, TA) <i>he wept for,</i> or <i>over, him,</i> i. e., one dead; or <i>did so, and enumerated his good qualities</i> or <i>actions;</i> syn. رَثَاهُ: (K:) or, as some say, بَكَاهُ means [<i>he wept because,</i> or <i>in consequence, of it,</i> i. e.,] <i>on account of being pained:</i> and بَكَى عَلَيْهِ, [<i>he wept for,</i> or <i>over, him,</i>] <i>by reason of tenderness of heart,</i> or <i>compassion:</i> and [hence] it is said that بَكَيْتُهُ is originally بَكَيْتُ مِنْهُ: (TA:) [and ↓ <br>\
      بَكَّاهُ may have an intensive, or a frequentative, meaning; for it is said that] بَكِّى, addressed to the eye, signifies <i>weep thou much,</i> and <i>repeatedly.</i> (Ham p. 461.) ―         -b2- [Hence,] بَكَت السَّحَابَةُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The cloud rained.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b3-  بَكَى also means <i>He sang:</i> [in the CK, وبَكَى عَنِّى is erroneously put for وبَكَى غَنَّى:] thus it has two contr. significations: (K, TA:) accord. to MF, it has this meaning only in relation to the pigeon and the like; but it is also used in this sense when said of a man, as in a verse cited voce جَنَازَةٌ, q. v. : and he observes that the assertion of its having two contr significations requires consideration, seeing that it is also said to signify رَثَى; [for in the performance of رِثَا=ء, it is a common practice to sing;] but رِثَا=ء is generally accompanied by lamentation, and غِنَا=ء by rejoicing.

                  , (S, TA,) aor. of the latter اَبْكُوهُ, (TA,) or اَبْكِيهِ, retaining its original form, accord. to a rule observed in the case of a verb having an infirm letter [for its second or third radical] lest a verb with a radical ى should be confounded with one having a radical و, (Ham p. 670,) i. e. [<i>I vied with him,</i> or <i>strove to exceed him, in weeping, and I exceeded him therein,</i> or] <i>I was a greater weeper</i> (اَبْكَى) <i>than he.</i> (S, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                     تباكي<br>\
                   signifies تَكَلَّفَ البُكَا=ءَ [i. e. <i>He affected weeping;</i> or <i>endeavoured,</i> or <i>constrained himself, to weep</i>]. (S, K.) Hence, in a trad., فَاـِنْ لَمْ <br>\
