All these forms occur in different readings of the saying in the Kur [ii. 260], فَبُهِتَ اْلَّذِى كَفَرَ and فَبَهِتَ &amp;amp;c., (IJ, TA,) explained in the Wá&#39;ee as meaning, <i>And he who disbelieved remained in confusion,</i> or <i>perplexity, not seeing his right course, looking as one in wonder:</i> (Lb, TA:) but accord. to him who reads فَبَهَتَ, the word الذى may hold the place of a noun in the accus. case [as will be seen from what follows].

      بهّتهُ:]) or <i>took him unawares,</i> or <i>by surprise,</i> or <i>unexpectedly,</i> or <i>suddenly.</i> (S, K.) Zj cites as an ex. of the former meaning the saying in the Kur [xxi. 41], تَاْتِيهِمْ بَغْتَةً فَتَبْهَتُهُمْ, i. e., <i>It shall come upon them suddenly,</i> or <i>unawares, and cause them to become confounded,</i> &amp;amp;c.: (TA: and so Bd and Jel explain it:) or, <i>and shall overcome them:</i> (Bd:) J cites the same as an ex. of the latter of the two meanings in the preceding sentence; but his doing so requires consideration; for the meaning which he gives is taken from the word بغتة; not from البَهْتُ. (MF, TA.) [But it is said also that] مُبَاهَتَةٌ [inf. n. of ↓ <br>\
      باهتهُ] signifies The <i>taking,</i> or <i>coming upon,</i> [one] <i>unawares, by surprise,</i> or <i>unexpectedly.</i> (JK.) ―         -b2-  بَهَتَهُ, aor.      <br>\

                  قَابَلَهُ بِالكَذِبِ [<i>he accused him to his face falsely,</i> or <i>with falsehood</i>]; (TA;) البَهْتُ signifies اِسْتِقْبَالُكَ اَخَاكَ بِمَا <br>\
                  لَيْسَ فِيهِ [<i>thy accusing thy brother,</i> or <i>fellow, to his face, of that which is not in him</i>]: (JK:) and بَهَتَهَا, aor.      <br>\

                  </quote> [<i>Revile thou the mother-in-law, and calumniate her,</i> or <i>forge lies against her</i>], على is [said by J to be] redundant, or pleonastic; for one does not say, بَعَتَ عَلَيْهِ, but only بَهَتَهُ. (S.) Upon this, F says, in the K, that فَاْبْهَتِى عليها [thus in the K] is a mistake; that J is in error, and that the right reading is فَاْنْهَتِى عليها, with ن: but this assertion made by F depends upon the authority of relaters of the verse in which the word in question occurs. (MF.) IB says that ابهتى may be here rendered trans. by means of على because it is syn. with اِفْتَرِى, which is so rendered trans., in like manner as is done in other instances, of which he gives an ex. from the Kur [xxiv. 63], يُخَالِفُونَ عَنْ اَمْرِهِ, meaning يَخْرُجُونَ عن امره: he adds that, accord. to J, عن in this ex. should be considered redundant; but that عن and على are not used redundantly like ب.
