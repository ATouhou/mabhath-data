                  مُومٌ: (M, TA:) it is an arabicized word; (IDrd, Mgh, Msb;) or seems to be so; composed of بَرْ and سَامْ; the former of these, in Persian, signifying the “breast,” or “chest;” and the latter, “death” [and “fire” and “a swelling;” of which three meanings, the second and third are agreeable with the two explanations of برسام given above]: so says Az.
