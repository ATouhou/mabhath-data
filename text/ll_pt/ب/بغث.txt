<b>بَغَاثٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     بَغَاثٌ<br>\
                     بغاث<br>\
                   (T, S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and بُغَاثٌ and بِغَاثٌ; (A, Mgh, K;) only the second of these three mentioned by Sb; (TA;) but the second and third asserted to be correct by Yoo; (AZ, TA;) and the last heard by Az; (TA;) or neither of these two is allowable; (Msb;) <i>A bird that does not prey, and such as one does not desire to make an object of prey because it is not eaten:</i> (T, Msb:) or <i>small birds that do not prey, such as sparrows and the like;</i> [a coll. gen. n.;] n. un. with ة: (Mgh:) or [accord. to Lth,] <i>a certain dust-coloured bird,</i> (T, A, K,) <i>of the birds of the water, ash-coloured, and long-necked;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      اَبْغَثُ; pl. [of the latter] بُغْثٌ and اَبَاغِثُ: (T:) [but this appears to be wrong; for AM says, in the T,] Lth makes the بغاث and the ابغث to be one, asserting them to be of aquatic birds; but in my opinion, the former is different from the latter: as to the latter, it is <i>a well-known kind of aquatic bird,</i> so called because it is <i>of the colour termed</i> <br>\
                  بُغْثَة, i. e. <i>white inclining to</i> <br>\
                  خُضْرَة [explained above, voce بُغْثَةٌ]: but as to the بغاث, it is <i>any bird that is not one of prey:</i> and the word is said to be a coll. gen. n., signifying the <i>class of birds that are objects of prey:</i> (TA:) ISk says that the بَغَاث is <i>a bird of a colour inclining to that of dust,</i> (S, Msb, *) <i>a little less than the</i> <br>\
                  رَخَمَة [or <i>vultur percnopterus</i>], (S,) or <i>less than the</i> <br>\
                  رخمة, (Msb,) <i>slow in flight:</i> (S, Msb:) but IB says that this is a mistake in two points of view; first, because بغاث is a [coll.] gen. n., of which the n. un. is with ة, like as is that of حَمَامٌ; and secondly, because it applies to the <i>class of birds that do not prey;</i> but the ↓ <br>\
      اَبْغَث is <i>a bird of the colour of dust,</i> and this may be <i>a bird of prey,</i> and it may be <i>not a bird of prey:</i> (TA:) AZ says that بغاث signifies the [<i>species of vulture called</i>] رَخَم; and the n. un. is with ة others, the <i>young ones of the</i> <br>\
                  رخم and <i>birds of the crowkind:</i> or [<i>birds</i>] <i>like the</i> [<i>hawks called</i>] سَوَادِق [pl. of سَوْدَقٌ], <i>not predaceous:</i> in the T, it is said to be [<i>a kind of bird</i>] <i>like the</i> [<i>hawk called</i>] بَاشَق, <i>that does not prey upon any other bird:</i> (TA:) or بِغَاثٌ and بُغَاثٌ (ISd, K) and بَغَاثٌ (K) signify the <i>worst</i> [or <i>most ignoble</i>] <i>of birds,</i> (ISd, K, [the latter giving this as a second and distinct signification,]) and <i>such as do not prey:</i> (ISd, TA:) Fr says, بَغَاثُ الطَّيْرِ signifies <i>the worst of birds,</i> and <i>such as do not prey;</i> and بُغَاثٌ and بِغَاثٌ are dial. vars.: (S:) the pl. is بِغْثَانٌ, (Sb, T, S, Msb, K,) accord. to those who make بغاث a sing., (Yoo, S, Msb, TA,) or accord. to those who make the sing. to be with ة; (T, TA;) or those who apply بَغَاثَةٌ [as a n. un.] to the male and the female make بَغَاثٌ to be pl. [or rather a coll. gen. n.]; (Yoo, S, Msb;) as is done in the case of نَعَامَةٌ and نَعَامٌ: (Yoo, S:) ISd says that بَغَاثَةٌ, with fet-h, is the n. un., applied alike to the male and the female: (TA:) [and Fei says,] it is not allowable to pronounce this with damm or with kesr to the first letter: (Msb:) but Yoo asserts both of these forms to be used: (AZ, TA:) and بغاثة is said to signify <i>a weak bird.</i> (TA.) It is said in a prov., اـِنَّ البَغَاثَ بِاَرْضِنَا يَسْتَنْسِرُ (S, A, Msb, K *) <i>Verily the</i> <br>\
                  بغاث <br>\
                  <i>in our land becomes</i> [<i>like</i>] <i>a vulture,</i> or <i>become</i> [<i>like</i>] <i>vultures:</i> (Msb:) applied to the low person who becomes of high rank: (A:) meaning (tropical:)  <i>the weak in our land becomes strong:</i> (Msb:) or <i>he who makes himself our neighbour becomes mighty, strong,</i> or <i>of high rank, by our means,</i> (S, K, TA,) <i>acquiring the might,</i> or <i>strength, of the vulture, after having been low,</i> or <i>mean, in condition.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>A bird of the colour above described:</i> (T, S:) whether it be a bird of prey or not: see بَغَاثٌ in two places: (IB, TA:) and صَقْرٌ اَبْغَثُ [<i>a hawk of that colour.</i>]; (ISh, A;) as well as اَحْوَى and اَبْيَضُ; i. e., that wherewith men take game. (ISh, TA.) بَغْثَا=ءُ applied to sheep or goats, (S, K,) or, as in some lexicons, to sheep, (TA,) is like رَقْطَا=ءُ; (S, K;) [<i>Black speckled with white;</i> or <i>the reverse;</i>] or <i>in which are blackness and whiteness, with predominance of the latter colour:</i> (TA:) or شَاةٌ بَغْثَا=ءُ and غَنَمٌ <br>\
