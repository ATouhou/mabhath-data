                     تبديل<br>\
                   properly signifies [The <i>changing,</i> or <i>altering,</i> a thing; or] the <i>changing,</i> or <i>altering, the form,</i> or <i>fashion,</i> or <i>semblance,</i> or <i>the quality,</i> or <i>condition,</i> [of a thing,] <i>to another form,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>while the substance remains the same;</i> (Th, T, TA;) or the <i>changing</i> a thing <i>from its state,</i> or <i>condition;</i> (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, TA;) or the <i>changing</i> a thing <i>without substitution:</i> (S:) but the Arabs have used it also in the sense of ↓ <br>\
      اـِبْدَالٌ, (Mbr, T, TA,) which signifies [the <i>changing</i> a thing <i>by substitution; exchanging</i> it; <i>replacing</i> it <i>with another thing;</i> or] the <i>removing,</i> or <i>displacing, the substance</i> [of a thing], <i>and introducing anew another substance.</i> (Th, T, TA.) You say, بَدَّلْتُهُ, inf. n. تَبْدِيلٌ, (M, * Msb, K,) meaning <i>I changed it,</i> or <i>altered it;</i> (M, K) or <i>I changed,</i> or <i>altered, the form,</i> or <i>fashion,</i> or <i>semblance,</i> or <i>the quality,</i> or <i>condition, of it;</i> (Msb;) as in the phrase, بَدَّلْتُ الخَاتَمَ بِالحَلْقَةِ [<i>I changed,</i> or <i>altered, the signet-ring into the simple ring</i>], said when one has melted the former and made of it a simple ring; (Fr, T, TA;) and بَدَّلَ اْللّٰهُ <br>\
                  السَّيِيَّاتِ حَسَنَاتٍ [<i>God changed the evil deeds into good deeds</i>]; the verb being doubly trans. by itself because it has the meaning of جَعَلَ and صَيَّرَ. (Msb. [But see what follows.]) ↓ <br>\
      اَبْدَلْتُهُ <br>\
                  بِكَذَا, [in the S, اَبْدَلْتُ الشَّىْءَ بِغَيْرِهِ, without explanation,] inf. n. اـِبْدَالٌ, [<i>I changed it by substituting for it such a thing,</i> or <i>exchanged it for such a thing,</i> or <i>replaced it with such a thing,</i>] is said when one has removed the first, and put the second in its place; (Msb;) as in the phrase, اَبْدَلْتُ الخَاتَمَ بِالحَلْقَةِ [<i>I changed the signet-ring by substituting for it the simple ring; exchanged the signet-ring for the simple ring;</i> or <i>replaced the signet-ring with the simple ring</i>]; said when one removes the one, and puts the other in its place: (Fr, T, TA:) and this verb is also made doubly trans. by itself, like بَدَّلْتُ, (Msb,) which is used in the sense of اَبْدَلْتُ [as shown above]; (Mbr, T, TA;) for instance, where it is said, [in the Kur lxvi. 5,] عَسَى رَبُّهُ اـِنْ طَلَّقَكُنَّ اَنْ يُبْدِلَهُ <br>\
                  اَزْوَجًا خَيْرًا مِنْكُنَّ [<i>May-be, his Lord, if he divorce you, will give him in exchange wives better than you</i>]; accord to one reading, يُبَدِّلَهُ (Msb.) An ex. of the latter of these two verbs in the sense of the former is the saying in the Kur [xxv. 70], يُبَدِّلُ اْللّٰهُ سَيِّا=تِهِمْ حَسَنَاتٍ [<i>God will change their evil deeds by substituting for them good deeds</i>]; i. e. will cancel the evil deeds and put in their place good deeds: but in the saying in the Kur [iv. 59], كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُمْ بَدَّلْنَاهُمْ جُلُودًا <br>\
                  غَيْرَهَا [<i>Whenever their skins are thoroughly burned, we will change the condition thereof to them into the condition of other skins</i>], the meaning is, that the first condition of their skins shall be restored;  so that the substance is one, but the condition is different. (Mbr, T, TA.) You say also, بَدَّلَهُ اْللّٰهُ <br>\
                  مَنَ الخَوْفِ اَمْنًا [<i>God gave him in exchange for fear,</i> or <i>in lieu of fear, security</i>]. (S.) [And بَدَّلَهُ بِهِ كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>He gave him in exchange for it,</i> or <i>in lieu of it, such a thing:</i> see Kur xxxiv. 15. And بدّل مَكَانَهُ كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>He gave in exchange for it,</i> or <i>in lieu of it, such a thing:</i> see Kur vii. 93 and xvi. 103.] بَدَّلَ حُسْنًا بَعْدَ سُوْءٍ, in the Kur [xxvii. 11], means <i>He hath done good [by way of exchange after evil</i>]; i. e., <i>repented;</i> (Jel;) or بَدَّلَ ذَنْبُهُ بِالتَوْبَةِ [<i>hath exchanged his sin for repentance</i>]. (Bd.) تَبْدِيلٌ and ↓ <br>\
      اـِبْدَالٌ both signify The act of <i>exchanging</i> [a thing for another thing]; or <i>making</i> [a thing] <i>to be a substitute</i> [for another thing]; (KL, PS;) and so does ↓ <br>\
      بَدَالٌ. (KL.) You say, بدّل الشَّىْءَ مِنَ الشَىْءِ, (M, K, *) and مِنْهُ ↓ <br>\
      ابدلهُ, i. e. اِتَّخَذَهُ مِنْهُ بَدلًا [here meaning <i>He exchanged the thing for the thing;</i> or, more literally, <i>he made the thing a substitute for the thing</i>]. (M, K. [In the text of the former of these, as given in the TT, instead of اِتَّخَذَهُ, I find تَخِذَ (a dial. var. of اِتَّخَذَ) without the affixed pronoun, which is meant to be understood or is omitted inadvertently by the transcriber: and here it should be observed, that the explanation which I have rendered as above admits of another meaning, namely, اَخَذَهُ مِنْهُ بَدَلًا “he took it as a substitute for it:” in the M, immediately before, اَخَذَهُ مِنْهُ بَدَلًا is given as the explanation of the phrases تبدّل الشَّىْءَ and بِالشَّىْءِ, and استبدلهُ and بِهِ: see 10.]) You say also, الثَّوْبَ بِغَيْرِهِ ↓ <br>\
      بَدَلْتُ, aor.      <br>\
                     بَدُلَ<br>\
                  , [inf. n. بَدَالٌ, mentioned and explained above, <i>I exchanged the garment,</i> or <i>piece of cloth, for another;</i> or <i>made it to be a substitute for another;</i>] and ↓ <br>\
      اِسْتَبْدَلْتُهُ <br>\
                  بِغَيْرِهِ signifies the same. (Msb. [But the latter phrase has more frequently another meaning, explained below: see 10.]) [↓ <br>\
      ابدلهُ in the phrases ابدلهُ كَذَا as meaning <i>He changed it into,</i> or <i>substituted for it, such a thing,</i> and ابدلهُ مِنْ كَذَا as meaning <i>he changed it from,</i> or <i>substituted it for, such a thing,</i> is more common than بدّله, which is used in the same sense; as ↓ <br>\
      بَدَلَهُ is also; for] AO applies the term ↓ <br>\
      مَبْدُولٌ [in lieu of the more common term ↓ <br>\
      مُبْدَلٌ] to a letter that is <i>changed</i> from another letter, as in مَدَهْتُهُ for مَدَحْتُهُ; and this shows that بَدَلْتُ is trans. [and signifies <i>I changed,</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (Az, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   and ↓ <br>\
      تَبَادَلٌ signify the same, (S,) namely, The act of <i>exchanging with another</i> or <i>others.</i> (PS.) You say, بادلهُ, inf. n. مُبَادَلَةٌ and بِدَالٌ [in the CK erroneously written with fet-h to the ب], <i>He exchanged,</i> or <i>made an exchange, with him;</i> or] <i>he gave him the like of that which he took,</i> or <i>received, from him;</i> (IDrd, * M, K;) for instance, a garment, or piece of cloth, in the place of another; (Lth, T, Msb, * in explanation of the former inf. n.;) and a brother in the place of a brother.

      تَبَادَلَا <br>\
                  <i>They exchanged,</i> or <i>made an exchange, each with the other;</i> or <i>each gave to the other the like of that which he took,</i> or <i>received, from him.</i> (TA.) نُبَادِلُهْ, ending a verse of El-Kulákh, means <i>for whom we would take a substitute:</i> El-Marzookee says, it is for نُبَادِلُ بِهِ النَّاسَ [<i>for whom we would make an exchange with the people</i>]; the preposition being suppressed.

      بَدِيلٌ (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) all signify the same; (S, M, Msb, K;) namely, <i>A substitute; a thing given,</i> or <i>received,</i> or <i>put,</i> or <i>done, instead</i> of, <i>in place</i> of, <i>in lieu</i> of, or <i>in exchange</i> for, another thing; <i>a compensation;</i> syn. خَلَفٌ, (M, K,) and عِوَضٌ: (Kull:) بَدَلُ الشَّىْءِ [and البَدَلُ مِنَ الشَّىْءِ] and ↓ <br>\
      بِدْلُهُ ↓ <br>\
      بَدِيلُهُ meaning الخَلَفُ مِنْهُ [<i>the substitute for the thing;</i> &amp;amp;c.]; (M, K;) i. e., another thing: (S:) pl. اَبْدَالٌ, (IDrd, Msb, K,) which, as pl. of ↓ <br>\
      بَدِيلٌ, has few parallels. (IDrd, TA.) Sb says, [making a distinction between بَدَلٌ and ↓ <br>\
      بَدِيلٌ,] you say, اـِنَّ بَدَلَكَ زَيْدٌ, i. e. <i>Verily Zeyd is in thy place:</i> but if you put بَدَل in the place of بَدِيلِ, you say, اـِنَّ بَدَلَكَ زَيْدٌ, i. e. ↓ <br>\
      اـِنَّ بِدَيلَكَ <br>\

(M.) You say also, بَلَ كَذَا [and بَدَلًا مِنْ كَذَا], meaning <i>Instead of, in the place of, in lieu of,</i> or <i>in exchange for, such a thing.</i> (Kull.) [And بَدَلَ اَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>Instead of thy doing thus.</i>] ―         -b2-  الاَبْدَالُ (IDrd, S, M, K, &amp;amp;c.) and البُدَلَا=ءُ (TA) [<i>The Substitutes,</i> or <i>Lieutenants;] certain righteous persons, of whom the world is never destitute; when one dies, God substituting another in his place: (S:) certain persons by means of whom God rules the earth;</i> (M, K;) <i>consisting of seventy men,</i> (IDrd, M, K,) <i>according to their assertion, of whom the earth is never destitute;</i> (IDrd, TA;) <i>forty of whom are in Syria, and thirty in the other countries;</i> (IDrd, M, K;) <i>none of them dying without another&#39;s supplying his place,</i> (M, K,) <i>from the rest of mankind;</i> (K;) <i>and therefore they are named</i> <br>\
