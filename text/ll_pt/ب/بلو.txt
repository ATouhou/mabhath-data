      اِبْتَلَيْتُهُ: (M, K:) each of these verbs implying two things; one of which is the learning the state, or condition, of the object, and becoming acquainted with what was unknown of the case thereof; and the other, the manifesting of the goodness or badness thereof; both of these things being sometimes meant, and sometimes only one of them, as when God is the agent, in which case only the latter is meant: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and ↓ <br>\
      التَّبَالِى, also, signifies <i>the act of trying, proving,</i> or <i>testing.</i> (S.) It is said in the Kur [xxi. 36], وَنَبْلُوكُمْ بِاْلشَّرِ وَاْلخَيْرِ فِتْنَةً [<i>And we try you by,</i> or <i>with, evil and good, by way of probation</i>]. (TA.) And in the same [ii. 118], ↓ <br>\

                   is from البلا=ء, [inf. n. of بَلَاهُ,] so that it signifies [properly] <i>I shall not,</i> or <i>I do not, care for him, mind him, heed him,</i> or <i>regard him, so as to share with him my trial and his trial:</i> (Ham p. 94:) [and hence,] one says thus, (S, Mgh, Msb,) or مَا اَبَالِيهِ, (M, K,) and لَا اَبَالِىبِهِ, (Mgh, Msb,) or مَا اُبَالِى بِهِ, (MF, TA,) but the verb is more chastely made trans. without the preposition بِ, (A, TA,) inf. n. مُبَالَاةٌ (M, Mgh, Msb, K) and بِلَا=ءٌ (M, K, TA [in the CK, erroneously, بَلاء]) and بَالَةٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) said by some to be a quasi-inf. n. and by others to be an inf. n., (MF, TA,) [in the T it is said to be a subst., from المُبَالَاةُ,] originally بَالِيَةٌ, like عَافِيَةٌ from عَافَاهُ, (T, S, Mgh, Msb,) and بَالٌ, [which is more strange,] (M, K,) meaning [merely] <i>I shall not,</i> or <i>I do not, care for, mind, heed,</i> or <i>regard, him,</i> or <i>it;</i> (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) <i>I shall not be,</i> or <i>I am not, disquieted by him,</i> or <i>it:</i> (Mgh, Msb:) or, as some say, لَا اُبَالِيهِ is formed by transposition from لَا اُبَاوِلُهُ, from البَالُ, i. e. <i>I will not,</i> or <i>I do not, cause him,</i> or <i>it, to move,</i> or <i>occur to, my mind; nor give,</i> or <i>pay, any attention to him,</i> or <i>it:</i> (Z, TA: [and the like is said in the T:]) or the proper [or literal] meaning is, <i>I will not,</i> or <i>I do not, contend with him for superiority in goodness,</i> or <i>excellence, by reason of my little care,</i> or <i>regard, for him:</i> (Mgh:) or it was employed to denote the contending with another for superiority in glory, or excellence, as will be shown by the citation of a verse in the latter portion of this paragraph; and then, in consequence of frequency of usage, came to denote contempt, or mean estimation: (Ham p. 31:) or its original meaning is, <i>I will not,</i> or <i>I do not, strive with him to be first; neglecting him,</i> or <i>leaving him to himself;</i> from تَبَالَى القَوْمُ as explained below; see 6. (Msb.) It is said in a trad., لَا يُبَالِيهِمُ اْللّٰهُ بَالَةً, or, accord. to one reading, لَا يُبَالِى بِهِمْ بَالَةً, meaning <i>God will not hold them to be of any value or weight.</i> (TA.) And in another, هٰوُلا=ءِ فِى الجَنَّةِ وَلَا اُبَالِى وَهٰوُلَا=ءِ فِى النَّارِ <br>\
                  وَلَا اُبَالِى, said to mean [<i>These</i> will be <i>in Paradise, and] I shall not disapprove;</i> [<i>and these</i> will be <i>in the fire</i> of Hell,] <i>and I shall not disapprove.</i> (Az, TA.) And one says, لَا اُبَالِى مَا صَنَعْتَ [<i>I shall not,</i> or <i>I do not, care for what thou didst,</i> or <i>hast done</i>]. (IDrd, TA.) And مَا اُبَالِى اَقُمْتَ <br>\
                  اَمْ قَعَدْتَ [<i>I care not whether thou stand or sit</i>]: and مَا اُبَالِى بِقِيَامِكَ وَعَدَمِهِ [<i>I care not for thy standing and thy not doing so</i>]. (Mughnee in art. ا.) And مَا بَالَيْتُ بِهِ (AZ, Msb, TA) <i>I did not care for, mind,</i> or <i>regard, him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (TA.) And بَالَى بِالشَّىْءِ [<i>He cared for the thing;</i> or] <i>he was disquieted by the thing.</i> (T.) The verb is sometimes thus used, in an affirmative manner; (Ham p. 94; [and the like is said in the TA;]) though some say that it is not; (Msb;) but it is not unless it occurs with a negative in the former part of the sentence or in the latter part thereof; as when one says, مَا بَالَى بِكَ صَدِيقُكَ وَلٰكِنْ بَالَى <br>\
                  عَبْدُكَ [<i>Thy friend cared not for thee, but thy slave cared</i>]; and as in the saying of Zuheyr, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>Verily I cared for the departure of Umm-Owfà, but Umm-Owfà cares not</i>]. (Ham p. 94.) One says also, لَمْ اُبَالِ and لَمْ اُبَلْ [<i>I did not care,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K: [but in the CK the latter of these is omitted:]) in the latter the ا [of prolongation] is suppressed for the purpose of alleviating the utterance, like as ى is suppressed in the inf. n. [or quasi-inf. n.] بَالَةٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) originally بَالِيَةٌ, (S, Msb,) and in لَا اَدْرِ: (S:) or the ا is suppressed in this case to avoid the concurrence of two quiescent letters; (Kh, Sb, M, IB;) not for the purpose of alleviating the utterance; (IB, TA;) for this is done because the ل is made quiescent. (Kh, Sb, M.) And, accord. to Kh, (Sb, M,) some of the Arabs say, لَمْ اُبَلِهِ [<i>I did not care for him,</i> or <i>it</i>], (Sb, M,) or لَمْ اُبَلِ, [in the CK, erroneously, لم اَبْلِ,] with kesr to the ل; (K, TA;) [for لم اُبَالِهِ, or لم اُبَالِ;] only suppressing the ا, as they do in عُلَبِطٌ [for عُلَابِطٌ]. (Sb, S, M.) ―         -b2-  IAar says that بَالَى, inf. n. مُبَالَاةٌ, is like ↓ <br>\
      اَبْلَى meaning <i>He exerted himself in a description of a war,</i> or <i>battle, or of generous conduct;</i> as when one says, اَبْلَى ذٰلِكَ <br>\
                  اليَوْمَ بَلَا=ءً حَسَنًا [<i>He exerted himself well, that day, in a description of war,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: and he cites the following verse [to which reference has been made above]: <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>What hath happened to me that I see thee standing exerting thyself in a description of generous qualities, when thou hast become</i> like one <i>dead by reason of leanness?</i>]: he says that he [the poet] heard him [whom he thus addresses] saying, “ We have eaten and we have drunk [with guests], and we have done [such and such things]; ” enumerating, or recounting, generous qualities or actions, and lying in doing so: (T, TA:) in another place he says that تُبَالِى means <i>looking to see which of them</i> [or <i>of thee and others</i>] <i>is best in</i> <br>\
                  بال [i. e. <i>state,</i> or <i>condition</i>], <i>while thou art dying:</i> (TA:) he says, also, that بَالَاهُ, inf. n. مُبَالَاةٌ, signifies <i>he contended with him for superiority in glory,</i> or <i>excellence;</i> (T, TA; *) and [it is said that] تبالى <br>\
                   in the verse here cited means <i>thus contending;</i> syn. تُفَاخِرُ: (Ham p. 31:) and accord. to IAar, بَالَاهُ also signifies <i>he contended with him in contradiction.</i> (T, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

(Jel.) And اَبْلَيْتُهُ مَعْرُوفًا [<i>I conferred upon him a favour,</i> or <i>benefit</i>]. (S.) Zuheyr says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

[<i>May God recompense with beneficence what they two have done to you,</i>] <i>and do to them two the best of the deeds wherewith He tries</i> [the thankfulness of] <i>his servants.</i> (T.) ―         -b3-  ابلاهُ also signifies <i>He made him to swear;</i> [as though he tried his veracity by so doing;] (M, K;) or so ابلاهُ يَمِينًا. (TA.) [See also 8.] ―         -b4-  And <i>He swore to him:</i> (M, K:) or this, (TA,) or ابلاهُ يَمِينًا, [as above,] (T, S,) <i>he swore</i> [or <i>swore an oath</i>] <i>to him, and thereby soothed,</i> or <i>placated, his mind.</i> (T, S, * TA.) ―         -b5-  And hence, (TA,) <i>He informed him, acquainted him,</i> or <i>told him.</i> (IAar, M, K, TA.) ―         -b6-  [And hence, <i>He manifested it; revealed it; made it manifest, apparent, evident, clear,</i> or <i>plain;</i> whence a phrase in a verse cited voce مُضْمَرٌ; and the phrase] مَا لَمْ يُبْلِ العُذْرَ, i. e. <i>As long as he does not manifest, show,</i> or <i>make apparent, the excuse:</i> but the verb [in this sense] is originally doubly trans.: one says, اَبْلَيْتُ فُلَانًا عُذْرًا, meaning <i>I manifested to such a one an excuse so that I was not to be blamed after it;</i> properly signifying <i>I made such a one to be acquainted with my excuse, and to know the manner thereof;</i> (Mgh;) and thus it is explained in the A: (TA: [in like manner, also, it is explained in the T:]) [or] ابلاهُ عُذْرًا signifies <i>He gave him an excuse which he accepted:</i> (M, K:) and in like manner, ابلاهُ <br>\
                  جُهْدَهُ [<i>He gave him his endeavour,</i> or <i>energy, in an acceptable manner</i>]; and نَايِلَهُ [<i>his gift</i>]. (M.)
