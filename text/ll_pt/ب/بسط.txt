                  , (M, TA,) inf. n. بَسْطٌ, (S, M, Msb,) contr. of تَبْسيِطٌ; (M, TA;) as also ↓بسّطهُ, (M,* TA,) inf. n. تَبْسيِطٌ. (TA.) [As such,] <i>He spread it; spread it out,</i> or <i>forth; expanded it; extended it;</i> (S, Msb, K, B;) as also ↓بسّطهُ: (K:) and <i>he made it wide,</i> or <i>ample:</i> these are the primary significations; and sometimes both of them may be conceived; and sometimes, one of them: and the verb is also used, metaphorically, as relating to anything which cannot be conceived as composed or constructed: (B:) and بَصْطٌ is the same as بَسْطٌ, (S, and K in art. بصط,) in all its meanings. (K.) You say, بَسَطَ الثَّوْبَ [<i>He spread, spread out, expanded,</i> or <i>unfolded, the garment,</i> or <i>piece of cloth</i>]. (Msb.) And بَسَطَ رِجْلَهُ (tropical:) [<i>He stretched forth,</i> or <i>extended, his leg</i>]. (TA.) And بَسَطَ <br>\
                  ذِرَاعَيْهِ, and ↓بَسَّطَهُمَا, (assumed tropical:) <i>He spread his fore arms upon the ground;</i> the doing of which [in prostrating oneself] in prayer is forbidden. (TA.) And بَسَطَ يَدَهُ (M, Msb, K) (tropical:) <i>He stretched forth,</i> or <i>extended, his arm,</i> or <i>hand;</i> (M, K;) as in the saying بَسَطَ اـِلِىَّ يَدَهُ بِمَا اُحِبُّ وَاَكْرَهُ (tropical:)  [<i>He stretched forth,</i> or <i>extended, towards me his arm,</i> or <i>hand, with,</i> i. e. <i>to do to me, what I liked and disliked</i>]: (M, TA: *) or <i>he stretched forth his hand opened.</i> (Msb.) It is said in the Kur [v. 31], لَيِنْ بَسَطْتَ اـِلَىَّ يَدَكَ لِتَقْتُلَنِي (assumed tropical:) [<i>Assuredly if thou stretch forth towards me thy hand to slay me</i>]. (M, TA.) بَسْطُ اليَدِ and الكَفِّ is sometimes used to denote assaulting and smiting: [as in the last of the exs. given above; and] as in the words of the Kur [lx. 2], وَيَبُسُطُوا اـِلَيْكُمْ اَيْدِيَهُمْ وَاَلْسِنَتَهُمْ <br>\
                  بِالسُّوْءِ (tropical:) [<i>And they will stretch forth towards you their hands and their tongues with evil</i>]; (TA;) i. e., by slaying, (Bd, Jel,) and smiting, (Jel,) and reviling. (Bd, Jel.) And sometimes to denote giving liberally: (TA:) [as in] بَسَطَ يَدَهُ فِى الاـَنْفَاقِ (tropical:) <i>He [stretched forth his hand, opened,</i> or] <i>was liberal</i> or <i>bountiful</i> or <i>munificent</i> [<i>in expenditure</i>]: (Msb:) see بَسِيطٌ, below. (TA.) And sometimes to denote taking, or taking possession, or seizing: as in the saying, (TA,) بُسِطَتْ يَدُهُ عَلَيْهِ (tropical:) [<i>His hand was stretched forth against him</i>]; i. e. <i>he was made to have dominion over him by absolute force and power.</i> (K, TA.) And sometimes to denote seeking, or demanding: [as in بَسَطَ كَفَّيْهِ <br>\
                  فِى الدُّعَا=ءِ (tropical:) <i>He expanded his two hands in supplication;</i> a common action, in which the two hands are placed together like an open book upon a desk before the face, in supplicating God:] see بَاسِطٌ, below. (TA.) ―         -b2-  [And hence,] بَسَطْتُ لَهُ اَمْرِى (tropical:) <i>I displayed,</i> or <i>laid open, to him my state,</i> or <i>case,</i> or <i>affair;</i> syn. فَرَشْتُهُ اـِيَّاهُ: (A in art. فرش:) and اَمْرَهُ [<i>his state,</i> &amp;amp;c.].

                  الحَيَاةِ (assumed tropical:) [<i>God diffuses the souls in the bodies at the time of</i> their <i>being animated</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b4-  [Hence also,] بَسَطَ اْللّٰهُ الرِّزْقَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>God multiplied,</i> or <i>made abundant, and amplified, enlarged,</i> or <i>made ample</i> or <i>plentiful, the means of subsistence.</i> (Msb, K. *) It is said in the Kur [ii. 246], وَاْللّٰهُ يَبِضُ <br>\
                  وَيَبْسُطُ (Msb and TA in art. قبض, q. v.) And you say, بَسَطَ عَلَيْهِمُ العَدْلَ (tropical:) [<i>He largely extended to them equity,</i> or <i>justice</i>]; as also ↓بسّطهُ. (TA.) ―         -b5-  [Hence also,] فُلَانٌ يَبْسُطُ عَبِيدَهُ ثُمَّ يَقْبِضُهُمْ (tropical:) [<i>Such a one enlarges the liberty of his slaves; then abridges their liberty</i>]. (A in art. قبض.) ―         -b6-  [Hence also, بَسَطَ وَجْهَهُ (assumed tropical:) <i>It unwrinkled, as though it dilated, his countenance:</i> see 7. And بَسَطَ قَلْبَهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>It dilated his heart:</i> see remarks on قَبْضٌ and بَسْطٌ, as used by certain of the Soofees, near the end of 1 in art. قبض. And] بَسَطَهُ, alone, [signifies <i>the same;</i> or] (tropical:) <i>it rejoiced him; rendered him joyous,</i> or <i>cheerful:</i> (M, K, TA:) because, when a man is rejoiced, his countenance becomes unwrinkled (يَنْبَسِطُ), and he becomes changed [and cheerful] in [its] complexion: it is wrongly said, by MF, to be not tropical: that it is tropical is asserted by Z, in the A: MF also says that it is not post-classical; and in this he is right; for it occurs in a saying of Mohammad: thus in a trad. respecting Fátimeh, يَبْسُطُنِى مَا <br>\
                  يَبْسُطُهَا <br>\
                  <i>What rejoices her rejoices me:</i> (TA:) [see also قَبَضَهُ, where this saying is cited according to another relation:] ↓اَبْسَطَنِى [as signifying (tropical:)  <i>it rejoiced me</i>] is a mistake of the vulgar [obtaining in the present day]. (TA.) ―         -b7-  [Hence also,] الخَيْرُ <br>\
                  يَقْبِضُهُ وَالشَّرُّ يَبْسُطُهُ (tropical:) [<i>Wealth makes him closefisted, tenacious,</i> or <i>niggardly; and poverty makes him open-handed, liberal,</i> or <i>generous</i>]. (A in art. قبض.) ―         -b8-  [Hence also,] بُسَطَ مِنْ فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  <i>He rendered such a one free from shyness,</i> or <i>aversion:</i> (S, O, K, TA:) <i>he emboldened him; incited him to [that kind of presumptuous boldness which is termed</i>] دَالَّة. (Har p. 155.) [In the CK, بَسَطَ فُلاناً من فُلانٍ is erroneously put for بَسَطَ فُلَانٌ مِنْ فُلَانص] ―         -b9-  [Hence also,] بَسَطَ اْللّٰهُ <br>\
