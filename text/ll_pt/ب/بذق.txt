      بَاذِقٌ (K) [in my copy of the Msb erroneously written باذيق] a Persian word, arabicized; originally بَادَهْ, which signifies <i>Wine:</i> (A&#39;Obeyd, TA:) or <i>juice of grapes cooked in the least degree, so as to be strong</i> (Mgh, Msb, K) <i>and intoxicating;</i> an arabicized word; (Msb;) said to have been introduced by the Benoo-Umeiyeh, (TA,) and to have been unknown to the Prophet; (Mgh;) but there is a trad. of I&#39; Ab which is understood to mean that the Prophet forbade what is thus called: (Mgh, TA:) some assert it to mean that it existed not in his time; (TA;) but this latter assertion is weak.

      بَيَاذَقَةٌ; (TA;) which latter signifies <i>footmen, as opposed to horsemen,</i> (AO, K, TA,) and is an arabicized word, from the Persian, (AO, TA,) originally پِيَادَهْ: (TA:) the pl. of بيذق is بَيَاذِقُ; for which a poet uses بُذُوقٌ, as though he suppressed the ى [in the sing.], making بيذق to become ↓ <br>\
