      بَازٌ is [originally] of the measure فَلْعٌ from this verb: (TA: [and it is said in the K that بَازٍ seems to be hence derived:]) for [or تطاول may here be used in another sense; for, accord. to Fei,] بَزَا, aor. as above, signifies <i>he overcame,</i> or <i>subdued;</i> and hence is derived ↓ <br>\
      بَازٍ. (Msb.) You say also, بَزَا عَلَيْهِ, aor. as above, meaning تطاول [i. e., thus followed by عليه, <i>He held up his head with an assumption of superiority over him; behaved haughtily towards him; exalted himself above him;</i> or <i>overpowered, subdued,</i> or <i>oppressed, him</i>]. (S.) And بُزِىَ بِالقَوْمِ <br>\

      ابزى <br>\
                  بِهِ: (K:) or this last signifies <i>he overcame him,</i> and <i>subdued him:</i> (S:) and بَزَاهُ, <i>he wronged him;</i> or <i>treated him wrongfully,</i> or <i>injuriously:</i> and ↓ <br>\
      ابزاهُ may signify the same; or this may mean <i>he induced him to become</i> <br>\
                  اَبْزَى, q. v.: (Ham p. 502:) and accord. to Aboo-Riyásh, ↓ <br>\
      ابزى signifies <i>he pressed heavily upon his adversary,</i> or <i>imposed on him that which he was unable to do,</i> or <i>to bear, in order to treat him wrongfully,</i> or <i>injuriously.</i> (Ham pp. 104 and 105.) [It is said that] بَزَوَانٌ [an inf. n. of which the verb, if it have one, is بَزَا,] signifies the act of <i>Leaping;</i> syn. وَثْبٌ. (S: [but I think it not improbable that this may have been taken from a mistranscription of نَزَوَانٌ, an inf. n. of نَزَا.])       -A2-  بَزِىَ, (K,) aor.      <br>\

Accord. to IAar, البزاء [probably a mistranscription for الاـِبْزَا=ءُ] signifies الصلف [i. e. الصَّلَفُ, app. meaning <i>An extravagant affecting of elegance of carriage,</i> such as is common with women].
