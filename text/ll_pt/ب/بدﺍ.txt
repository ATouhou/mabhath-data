      ابدا signifies the same. (Msb.) [So in the Kur xii. 76, فَبَدَاَ بِاَوْعِيَتِهِمْ قَبْلَ وِعَا=ءِ اَخِيهِ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;And he began with their bags, before the bags of his brother.&lt;/i&gt; And بَدَاَهُ is sometimes used in the sense of بَدَاَ بِهِ; whence, in the Kur ix. 13, وَهُمْ بَدَوُوكُمْ اَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ <br>\

      ابتداهُ; (M, K;) i. e., &lt;i&gt;not after the example of anything preceding.&lt;/i&gt; (TA. [But this addition seems rather to belong to another explanation to be mentioned below.]) One does not say, زَيْدًا ↓ <br>\
      ابتدا nor بَدَاَهُ, because these two verbs [signifying as last explained above] do not have for their objects corporeal things. (Mgh.) [El-Mutanakhkhil El-Hudhalee uses the phrase سَاَبْدُوُهُمْ بِمَشْمَعِةٍ <br>\

      مَا يُبْدِيُ [in the Kur xxxiv. 48, means &lt;i&gt;What doth that which is false,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;the Devil, originate,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;produce in the first instance? and what doth it,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;he, reproduce&lt;/i&gt; after it hath perished?]: Zj says that مَا, here, is in the place of an accus., meaning in each Instance اَىَّ شَىْءٍ: or it may be a negative; and الباطل here is Iblees; i. e., &lt;i&gt;Iblees createth not, nor raiseth to life&lt;/i&gt; after death.
