                  , (S, Mgh, &amp;amp;c.,) aor. يَبِيعُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. بَيْعٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and مَبِيعٌ, (S, Msb, K,) which latter is anomalous, (S,) the regular form being مَبَاعٌ, (S, K,) has two contr. significacations: <i>He sold it:</i> and <i>he bought it:</i> (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) and ↓ <br>\
      اباعهُ is a dial. var. of the same: (IKtt, Msb:) [but app. only in the former sense:] or this last signifies <i>he offered it for sale;</i> or <i>exposed it to sale:</i> (S, K:) and ↓ <br>\
      ابتاعهُ, as well as بَاعَهُ, signifies <i>he bought it.</i> (S, * Mgh, * Msb, K.) The primary signification of بَيْعٌ is The <i>exchanging,</i> or <i>exchange, of property;</i> or the <i>making an exchange with property;</i> as in the phrases بَيْعٌ رَابِحٌ [<i>an exchange of property bringing gain</i>], and بَيْعٌ خَاسِرٌ [<i>an exchange of property occasioning loss</i>]: and this is a proper signification when it relates to real substances: but it is tropically used to signify the <i>making the contract</i> [<i>of sale and purchase</i>]; because this is the means of giving [and obtaining] possession: [though this signification is what is termed حَقِيقَةٌ عُرْفِيَّةٌ, i. e., a sense so common as to be conventionally regarded as proper:] the phrase صَحَّ البَيْعُ, or بَطَلَ, and the like, mean صَفْقَةُ البَيْعِ; [i. e. <i>The contract of sale,</i> or <i>purchase, was valid,</i> or <i>was null;</i>] but the prefixed n. being suppressed, and its complement [alone] used for it, and this being masc., the verb is made masc. (Msb.) بَاعَ [mostly signifies <i>He sold;</i> and] is doubly trans., both by itself and by means of مِنْ prefixed to the second object; (Mgh, Msb;) this prep. being thus used as a corroborative: (Msb:) you say, بَاعَهُ الشَّىْءَ and بَاعَهُ مِنْهُ [<i>He sold to him the thing</i> and <i>He sold it to him</i>]: (Mgh:) and بِعْتُ زَيْدًا الدَّارَ and بِعْتُ مِنْ <br>\
                  زَيْدٍ الدَّارَ [<i>I sold to Zeyd the house:</i> (see also an explanation of the phrase اِسْتَبَعْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ: and see بَاعَهُ مِنَ السُّلْطَانِ: to which might be added countless similar instances; for when باع signifies <i>he sold,</i> <br>\
                  مِنْ is generally prefixed to the noun or pronoun denoting the person to whom the thing is sold:)] and sometimes لِ is put in the place of مِنْ; so that you say, بِعْتُكَ الشَّىْءَ and بِعْتُهُ لَكَ [<i>I sold to thee the thing</i> and <i>I sold it to thee</i>]; the ل being redundant [when the verb has this meaning, though not when it has the contr. meaning, as will be seen below]. (Msb.) Of the contr. signification we have an ex. in the saying of ElFarezdak, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        اـِنَّ الشَّبَابَ لَرَابِحٌ مَنْ بَاعَهَا<br>\

                  </quote> [<i>Verily youthfulness, he who buys it is a gainer; but hoariness, there are no traffickers for its sellers;</i> the part. a. being here from the verb in the former sense]: (S, TA:) and [often in a case in which the verb is followed by ل; as] in بَاعَ لَهُ <br>\
                  الشَّىْءَ <br>\
                  <i>He bought for him the thing;</i> (Mgh;) [the ل not being redundant when the verb is used in this sense;] and as in the saying of Tarafeh, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَيَاْتِيكَ بالْاَخْبَارِ مَنْ لَمْ تَبِعْ لَهُ<br>\

                        بَتَاتًا وَلَمْ تَضْرِبْ لَهُ وَقْتَ مَوْعِدِ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>And he will bring thee tidings for whom thou hast not bought travelling-provisions, and for whom thou hast not assigned an appointed time</i> for his bringing them]: (TA:) and in the saying, بَاعَ <br>\
                  دُنْيَاهُ بِا=خِرَتِهِ (tropical:)  [<i>He purchased his enjoyments of the present world at the expense of his enjoyments of the world to come</i>]: (Z, TA:) and [in like manner] you say, زَيْدٌ الدَّارَ ↓ <br>\
      ابتاع, meaning <i>Zeyd bought the house:</i> and لِغَيْرِهِ ↓ <br>\
      ابتاعها <br>\
                  <i>He bought it for another person.</i> (Msb.) The verb has this signification, also, in the trad., لَا يَبِعْ بَعْضُكُمْ عَلَى <br>\
                  بَيْعِ اَخِيهِ [<i>One of you shall not buy in opposition to the buying of his brother when an agreement has been manifested but the contract has not been concluded</i>]; (S, IAth, Mgh, Msb; [but in the S and Msb and by IAth, the trad. is related thus; لَا يَخْطُبِ الرَّجُلُ عَلَى خِطْبَةِ اَخِيهِ وَلَا يَبِعْ عَلَى بَيْعِ <br>\
                  اَخِيهِ; (see art. خطب;)]) as is shown by the relation of Bkh, الرَّجُلُ عَلَى بَيْعِ اَخِيهِ ↓ <br>\
      لَا يَبْتَاعُ: (Mgh, Msb:) or it may here have the contr. meaning: (IAth:) Az says that the seller and buyer are equal in offence when either of them does thus to another. (TA.) [Similar to this is the saying, لَا يَسُومُ الرَّجُلُ عَلَى سَوْمِ اَخِيهِ: see art. سوم. See also بَاعَ عَلَى بَيْعِهِ below, used in a tropical sense.] You say also, بَاعَ عَلَيْهِ القَاضِى, meaning <i>The judge sold against his will;</i> (Mgh;) <i>sold without his consent.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b2-  The pass. form is بِيعَ [<i>It was sold:</i> and <i>it was bought</i>]: (S, K:) optionally either [thus] with kesr to the ب, or [بُيْعَ] with damm to the ب, (S,) [or rather with a sound between that of damm and that of kesr, which pronunciation is termed اـِشْمَامٌ;] and some say بُوعَ; (S, K;) changing the ى into و: and thus in the cases of كِيلَ and قِيلَ and the like: (S:) [but Ibn-Málik requires damm or اشمام in the passive of a verb of which the medial radical is ى, and kesr or اشمام in the passive of a verb of which the medial radical is و, to prevent the mistaking of an active verb for a passive in such cases as بِعْتُ and سُمْتُ: others, however, only prefer what Ibn-Málik absolutely requires in these cases. (See I&#39;Ak p. 131.)] ―         -b3-  You say also, بَاعَهُ مِنَ السُّلْطَانِ, [lit. <i>He sold him to the Sultán,</i>] meaning (tropical:)  <i>he slandered him,</i> or <i>calumniated him,</i> <br>\
                  <i>to the Sultán.</i> (K, TA.) ―         -b4-  And بَاعَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى <br>\
                  بَيْعِهِ, [of which the lit. meaning has been shown above,] meaning (tropical:)  <i>Such a one superseded him,</i> or <i>occupied his place, in respect of honourable and elevated station</i> or <i>rank, and gained the mastery over him;</i> (K, * TA;) and so حَلَّ بِوَادِيهِ: (TA:) or بَاعَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى بَيْعِ فُلَانٍ means (tropical:)  <i>such a one gained the mastery over such a one, and wrested from him that which he sought to obtain from him;</i> and is an old proverb, applied by the Arabs to a man who contends with another, and seeks to obtain a thing from him by superior power or force, when he has succeeded in doing as above explained; and similar to it is the saying شَقَّ فُلَانٌ <br>\
                  غُبَارَ فُلَانٍ. (El-Mufaddal Ed-Dabbee, TA.) One also says, مَا بَاعَ عَلَى بَيْعِكَ اَحَدٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Not any one has equalled thee.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  بَيْعٌ is also used in the sense of اِنْبِسَاطٌ. (TA in art. بوع.

Kh says that the letter suppressed in مَبِيعٌ is the و of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, because it is augmentative: but Akh says that the letter suppressed is the medial radical; for when they made the ى quiescent, they transferred its vowel to the letter before it, so that it became madmoomeh, [the word thus being altered to مَبُيْوعٌ,] then they changed the dammeh into kesreh because of the ى after it, then the ى was suppressed, and the و was changed into ى, like the و of مِيزَانٌ, because of the kesreh: accord. to El-Mázinee, each of these sayings is good; but that of Akh is the more agreeable with analogy.
