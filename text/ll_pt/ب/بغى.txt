      اَبْغِنِى signifies <i>Seek thou for me such a thing;</i> and also <i>Aid thou me to seek such a thing.</i> (JK.) It is said in the Kur [ix. 47], يَبْغُونَكُمُ <br>\
                  الفِتْنَةَ <br>\
                  <i>They seek,</i> or <i>desire, for you discord,</i> or <i>dissension;</i> or <i>they seeking,</i> &amp;amp;c.: and in the same [iii. 94], تَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا <br>\
                  <i>Ye seek,</i> or <i>desire, for it,</i> namely, the way [of God], <i>crookedness;</i> or <i>ye seeking,</i> &amp;amp;c.: the first objective complement of the verb being in the accus. case because of the suppression of the preposition ل.

                  <i>It procured to me disease; it caused disease to befall me.</i> (Ham p. 794.) And اـِنَّهُ لَذُو بُغَايَةٍ <br>\

                  بُغَايَةٍ لِلْكَسْبِ, meaning <i>a seeker of gain.</i> (TA.) And مَابُغِىَ لَهُ <br>\
                  <i>Good was not appointed to betide him.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  بَغَى عَلَى اَخِيهِ, inf. n. بَغْىٌ, <i>He envied his brother; he wished that a blessing, or cause of happiness, or an excellence, might become transferred from his brother to himself:</i> so says Lh, who holds this to be the primary signification of the verb. (TA.) It is said in a prov., البَغْىُ <br>\
                  عِقَالُ النَّصْرِ [<i>Envy is the shackle of aid</i> from God against an enemy or a wrongdoer]. (TA.) ―         -b5-  Hence, (Lh, TA,) بَغْىٌ signifies The <i>acting wrongfully, injuriously,</i> or <i>tyrannically;</i> (Lh, S, TA;) because the envier so acts towards the envied; his endeavour being to cause, by guile, the blessing of God upon him to depart from him: (Lh, TA:) or the <i>seeking,</i> or <i>endeavouring, to act corruptly, wrongly,</i> or <i>unjustly:</i> (Az, TA:) or the <i>exceeding the due bounds,</i> or <i>just limits, in any way:</i> (S:) accord. to Er-Rághib, it is of two kinds: one of these is approved, and this is the <i>passing beyond the bounds of equity to exercise beneficence, and beyond the bounds of obligatory duties to do what is not obligatory:</i> the other is disapproved, and this is the <i>passing beyond the bounds of that which is true,</i> or <i>right, to do that which is false,</i> or <i>wrong,</i> or <i>to do acts of a doubtful nature:</i> but in most instances it is that which is disapprove. (TA.) You say, بَغَى عَلَيْهِ, (S, K,) and بغى عَلَى <br>\

Lh mentions, on the authority of Ks, the saying, مَا لِى وَلِلْبَغِ بَعْضِكُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ [<i>What have I to do with wrongful conduct,</i> the wrongful conduct <i>of one of you towards another?</i>], for وَلِلْبَغْىِ; ISd thinks, because of the difficulty found in pronouncing the kesreh after the ى. (TA.) بَغَى also signifies <i>He occupied himself with corrupt, wrong,</i> or <i>unjust, conduct:</i> [accord. to Fei,] from the same verb [in a sense to be mentioned below,] said of a wound. (Msb.) Also, aor.      <br>\
                     بَغِىَ<br>\

(TA.) ―         -b6-  And [hence,] بَغَى فِى مِشيَتِهِ, (K,) inf. n. بَغْىٌ, (TA,) <i>He</i> [app. a horse, and perhaps a man also,] <i>was proud,</i> or <i>self-conceited, and quick, in his gait:</i> (K:) or بَغْىٌ in a horse, (S, TA,) or in the running of a horse, (JK, TA,) is the <i>being proud,</i> or <i>self-conceited, with exceeding briskness</i> or <i>liveliness</i> or <i>sprightliness.</i> (JK, S, TA.) ―         -b7-  And بَغَتِ <br>\

                  <i>The valley flowed with water reaching to a place to which it had not reached before.</i> (S, TA.) ―         -b8-  بَغَتْ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) said of a woman, (Th, IKh, S, Msb, and so in some copies of the K,) or of a female slave, (so in other copies of the K,) but it is not restricted to the latter, (TA,) aor.      <br>\

      بَاغَتْ, (IKh, S, * Msb, K,) inf. n. بِغَا=ءٌ (IKh, K) and مُبَاغَاةٌ, (K,) said of a female slave: (Msb:) or مباغاة signifies the <i>committing fornication,</i> or <i>adultery, with another.</i> (KL.) It is said in the Kur [xxiv. 33], وَلَا تُكْرِهُو فَتَيَاتِكُمْ <br>\
                  عَلَى البِغَا=ءِ [<i>And compel not ye your young women to prostitute themselves</i>]. (Mgh.) And you say, ↓ <br>\
      خَرَجَتِ المَرْاَةُ تُبَاغِى [<i>The woman went forth</i> for <i>prostituting herself</i>]. (S.) Accord. to the Jema etTefáreek, بِغَا=ءٌ signifies The <i>knowing of a woman&#39;s committing fornication</i> or <i>adultery,</i> or <i>prostituting herself, and approving,</i> or <i>being content:</i> but this, if correct, is an amplification in speech.

                  <i>purulent matter.</i> (JK.) And بَرَاَ جُرْحُهُ عَلَى بَغْىٍ <br>\

                   is said in the S to be quasi-pass. of بَغَيْتُهُ, like as اِنْكَسَرَ is of كَسَرْتُهُ; and Esh-Shiháb says of the aor. that it is quasi-pass. of بَغَاهُ, aor. يَبْغِيهِ, in the sense of طَلَبَهُ: (TA:) [Fei says,] it has been asserted that انبغى is quasi-pass. of بَغَى; but a verb of the measure انفعل is not used as a quasi-pass. unless it implies effort, and the consequence of an action, as in the case of كَسَرْتُهُ, of which the quasi-pass. is اِنْكَسَرَ; which انبغى does not: some, however, allow its being thus used: (Msb:) accord. to Zj, it is as though it were syn. with اِنْطَلَبَ, as quasi-pass. of طَلَبَ, and means <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, suitable, fit, meet,</i> or <i>proper;</i> (Zj, TA;) [or <i>right,</i> and <i>allowable;</i> and <i>good:</i> or <i>very requisite:</i> (see explanations of exs. following:) or <i>it behooved:</i> and] <i>it was,</i> or <i>became, facilitated,</i> or <i>easy;</i> (Er-Rághib, K;) and <i>practicable,</i> or <i>manageable.</i> (Er-Rághib, TA.) Accord. to some, this verb is not used in the pret. tense, but only in the aor.: it is reckoned among verbs imperfectly inflected: (Msb, TA:) but the pret. is mentioned by AZ and Sb and Zj, and by ElKhattábee on the authority of Ks; and was often used by Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee: it is, however, very rare. (TA.) You say, يَنْبَغِى لَكَ اَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا [<i>It is suitable to thee,</i> or <i>is fit, meet,</i> or <i>proper,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>for thee,</i> or <i>it behooveth thee, that thou shouldst do such a thing</i>]. (S, TA.) And, accord. to Zj, اِنْبَغَى لِفُلَانٍ اَنْ يَفْعَلَ, as meaning <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, suitable to such a one,</i> or <i>fit, meet,</i> or <i>proper, for him, that he should do,</i> or <i>to do,</i> such a thing. (TA.) And مَا يَنْبَغِى لَكَ اَنْ تَفْعَلَ هٰذَا, (Lh, K,) and ↓ <br>\

      ما اْبْتُغِىَ; (Lh, K;) of which four phrases, the first is given by Lh as explanatory of the third and fourth, and means, accord. to Esh-Shiháb, <i>It is not right, proper, fit,</i> or <i>meet, nor allowable, for thee that thou shouldst do this,</i> or <i>to do this;</i> and <i>it is not good for thee</i> &amp;amp;c.; but he adds that only the aor. has been heard from the Arabs in this sense. (TA.) And يَنْبَغِى اَنْ يَكُونَ كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>It is very requisite that it should be so,</i> or <i>that such a thing ought be;</i> [or <i>it ought to be so,</i> or <i>such a thing ought to be; it behooves that it should be so,</i> or <i>such a thing behooves;</i>] <i>it is not well that such a thing should be neglected,</i> or <i>left undone.</i> (Msb.) And Ks is related to have heard, from the Arabs, the phrase, مَا يَنْبَغِى اَنْ يَكُونَ كَذَا, meaning <i>It is not right that it should be so,</i> or <i>that such a thing should be:</i> or <i>it is not good</i> &amp;amp;c. (Msb.) It is said in the Kur [xxxvi. 69], وَمَا عَلَّمْنَاهُ الشِّعْرَ وَمَا <br>\
                  يَنْبَغِى لَهُ, i. e.
