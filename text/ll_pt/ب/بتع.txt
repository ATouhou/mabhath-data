                  : see بَتِعٌ, in three places.       -A2-  It is also a word used as a corroborative: you say, جَاوُوا <br>\
                  اَجْمَعُونَ اَكْتَعُونَ اَبْتَعُونَ [<i>They came, all of them,</i> or <i>all together</i>]: (S:) and جَا=ءَ القَوْمُ اَكْتَعُونَ <br>\
                  اَبْتَعُونَ اَبْصَعُونَ [<i>the people,</i> or <i>company of men, came, all of them,</i> or <i>all together</i>]: (AHeyth:) and جَاوُوا كُلُّهُمْ اَجْمَعُونَ اَكْتَعُونَ اَبْتَعُونَ [<i>they came, all of them, all together</i>]: these words which follow اجمعون being imitative sequents to it, not occurring save after it [in the order above]: (O, K:) or one may begin with whichsoever of them he will, after it. (Ibn-Keysán, K.) And [the fem. is بَتْعَا=ءُ:] you say القَبِيلَةُ كُلُّهَا جَمْعَا=ءُ <br>\
                  كَتْعَا=ءُ بَصْعَا=ءُ بَتْعَا=ءُ [<i>The tribe, all of it, all together:</i> in the CK, erroneously, كُثْعا=ءُ (with damm and ث) and بُصْعاءُ and بُتْعاءُ]. (K.) And [the pl. of بَتْعَا=ءُ is ↓ <br>\
      بُتَعُ, originally بَتْعَاوَاتٌ:] you say النِّسَا=ءُ <br>\
                  كُلُّهُنَّ جُمَعُ كُتَعُ بُصَعُ بُتَعُ [<i>The women, all of them, all together:</i> in the CK, erroneously, جُمَعٌ <br>\
                  كُتَعٌ بُصَعٌ بُتَعٌ, though it is well known that each of these is determinate, and imperfectly declinable]. (K.) It is only necessary that he who mentions all these words should mention first كُلّ, and follow it with the word formed from ج م ع, then add the rest in whatsoever order he will; but the more approved way is to put the word formed from ك ت ع before the rest. (TA.) Fr mentions the phrases اَعْجَبنِى القَصْرُ اَجْمَعَ [The palace pleased me, all of it, or altogether], and الدَّارُ جَمْعَا=ءَ [the house, all of it, or altogether], with the accus. case, as denotative of state; but does not allow اَجْمَعُونَ nor جُمَعُ to be used otherwise than as corroboratives: IDrst, however, allows اَجْمَعِينَ to be used as a denotative of state; and this is correct; and accord. to both these ways is related the trad., فَصَلُّوا جُلُوسًا اَجْمَعِينَ and اَجْمَعُونَ [And pray ye sitting, all of you, or all together]; though some make اجمعين [here] to be a corroborative of a pronoun understood in the accus. case, as though the speaker said, اَعْنِيكُمْ <br>\
                  اَجْمَعِينَ [I mean you, all of you, or all together]. (K.) [But see اَجْمعُ.]   </entryFree> <br>\
