                  , inf. n. بَخْسٌ, <i>He diminished it; lessened it; made it deficient,</i> or <i>defective:</i> (S, A, Msb, K:) or <i>he made it faulty.</i> (Msb.) You say, بَخَسَ الكَيَّالُ [for بَخَسَ الكَيَّالُ الكَيْلَ <br>\

                  <i>He shall not fear diminution</i> of the reward of his actions, <i>nor wrong,</i> or <i>injustice.</i> (TA.) And in this sense, [as also in the next,] the verb is doubly trans. (Msb.) You say, بَخَسَهُ حَقَّهُ <br>\
                  <i>He diminished to him his right,</i> or <i>due; deprived him,</i> or <i>defrauded him, of a part of it.</i> (S, A.) And it is said in the Kur [vii. 83 and xi. 86 and xxvi. 183], وَلَا تَبْخَسُوا <br>\

                   Any one <i>who acts wrongfully,</i> or <i>unjustly.</i> (TA.) It is said in a prov., تَحْسِبُهَا حَمْقَا=ءَ <br>\
                  وَ هِىَ بَاخِسٌ; (S, A, K;) so runs the prov.; but accord. to Th, (S,) you may also say بَاخِسَةٌ; (S, K;) i. e., [<i>Thou thinkest her stupid,</i>] <i>but she is wrongful,</i> or <i>unjust:</i> applied to him who feigns himself to be of weak understanding when he is crafty and cunning. (K, TA.) The origin of the prov. was this: a man of the Benu-l-&#39; Ambar, of Temeem, mixed his property with that of a woman, coveting the possession of it, and thinking that she was stupid, and that she did not take care of her property nor know it: then he made a division with her, after he had mixed; but she was not content with the division until she took her property: she complained of him to those in authority, so that he released himself from her by giving her what she desired of the property: and the man was reproved for his conduct; it being said to him, “ Thou cheatest a woman: is not this wrongful conduct (بَخْس)? ” whereupon he replied in the words above, which became a proverb.
