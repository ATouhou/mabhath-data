                  <i>A piece of paper:</i> (IAar, M, Sgh, TA:) in the K, الحَدَقَةُ is erroneously put for الوَرَقَةُ: (TA:) <i>a ticket that is attached to a garment,</i> or <i>piece of cloth,</i> (T, S, M, L, K,) <i>bearing the mark,</i> or <i>inscription, of its price;</i> (T, S, L, K;) or <i>a ticket marked,</i> or <i>inscribed, with the weight,</i> and <i>the number, of a thing:</i> (TA:) of the dial. of Egypt (T, S, L) and the neighbouring parts: (T, L:) so called, (K,) or said (by Sh, TA) to be so called, (S,) because it is tied by a twist, or thread, (بِطَاقَةً,) of the unwoven end of the cloth: (S, K:) but this is a mistake: (ISd, TA:) [in Greek,        <br>\
      <orth lang=&quot;gr&quot;>πιττάκιον</orth>, as observed by Freytag; and hence probably derived:] accord. to some, it is [نِطَاقَةً,] with ن, because it tells (تَنْطِقُ) what is marked, or inscribed, thereon; but this is strange. (TA.) It is said in a trad., that a man will be brought on the day of resurrection, and ninety-nine scrolls, or records, inscribed with his sins will be produced; and there will be produced for him a بطاقة bearing the testimony that there is no deity but God, and it will outweigh the others.
