                  بَكْرٌ and بَكْرَةٌ are respectively terms like فَتنًى and فَتَاةٌ; and قَلُوصٌ is like the term جَارِيَةٌ; so say, among others, ISk and Az and IJ; and it is added in the Mutahffidh, that the terms جمل and ناقة are applied only when the animal has entered the seventh year: (Msb:) but بعير is more commonly applied to the <i>male camel;</i> (Msb, K;) and only to <i>one that has entered its fifth year;</i> (S, K;) or <i>that has entered its ninth year:</i> (K:) the pl. is اَبْعِرَةٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and بُعْرَانٌ (S, Msb, K) and بِعْرَانٌ (K) and بُعُرٌ (TA) and (pl. of اَبْعِرَةٌ TA) اَبَاعِرُ (S, Msb, K) and اَبَاعِيرُ (K.)

                  بعير], the persons so addressed, accord. to EshSháfi&#39;ee, are not to give a she-camel: (Msb:) but the following phrases are transmitted from the Arabs: صَرَعَتْنِى بَعِيرِى <br>\
                  <i>My she-camel threw me down prostrate:</i> (S, A:) and حَلَبْتُ بَعِيرِى <br>\

                  <i>I drank of the milk of my camel:</i> (S:) and كِلَا هٰذِيْنِ البِعْرَيْنِ نَاقَةٌ <br>\
                  <i>Each of these two camels is a she-camel.</i> (A.) لَيْلَةُ البَعِيرِ [<i>The night of the camel</i>], mentioned in a trad. of Jábir, means the night in which the Prophet purchased of him his camel. (TA.) ―         -b2-  Also <i>An ass:</i> (IKh, K:) so in the Kur xii. 72; but this signification is of rare occurrence: (IKh:) and <i>anything that carries:</i> (IKh, K:) so in the Hebrew language [<H>165</H> (see Gen. xlv. 17)].
