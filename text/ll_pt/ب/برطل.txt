                  <i>A long stone:</i> pl. بَرَاطِيلٌ: (S:) or <i>a broad stone:</i> (TA in art. برم:) or <i>a stone</i> (Seer, A, K) <i>of an oblong form</i> (A, TA) <i>a cubit in length,</i> (Seer, TA,) or <i>an iron, long, broad, and hard by nature,</i> (K,) <i>not such as is made long, or sharpened</i> or <i>made sharp-pointed, by men,</i> (TA,) <i>with which the millstone is pecked</i> (تُنْقَرُ [i. e., <i>wrought into shape, and roughened in its surface, by pecking</i>]): so says Lth: (TA:) to this is sometimes likened the muzzle, or fore part of the nose and mouth, of a she-camel of high breed: (Lth, TA:) [and hence,] it signifies also (assumed tropical:)  the <i>muzzle,</i> or <i>fore part of the nose and mouth, of an old bear:</i> (TA:) some say that the dual signifies <i>two elongated stones, of the hardest kind, slender, and sharp-pointed, with which the millstone is pecked</i> (تُنْقَرُ [explained above]). (TA.) Also, (K,) accord. to Sh, (TA,) <i>A pickaxe,</i> or <i>stonecutter&#39;s pick;</i> syn. مِعْوَلٌ: (Sh, Msb, K:) pl. as above: accord. to IAar, <i>what is called in Persian</i> <br>\

(TA.)       -A2-  <i>A bribe;</i> syn. رِشْوَةٌ: (Msb, K:) app. mentioned in the K as an Arabic word; and if so, the pronunciation with fet-h to the ب is a vulgarism, since there is no such measure as فَعْلِيلٌ: Abu-l-&#39;Alà El-Ma&#39;arree says that it is not known in this sense in the [classical] language of the Arabs; and it seems as though it were taken from the same word signifying “an oblong stone;” as though the bribe were likened to a stone that is thrown: (TA:) or it seems as though it were taken from the same word signifying a مِعْوَل; because therewith a thing is got out; (Msb;) and so El-Munáwee asserts it to be: (TA:) pl. as above. (Msb, K.) Hence the phrase, اَلْقَمَهُ البِرْطِيلَ [<i>He tipt him the bribe; conveyed it to him in like manner as one puts a morsel into another&#39;s mouth;</i> somewhat like our phrase <i>he greased his fist</i>].
