                  , also pronounced بَاجٌ, without ء, (IAar, S, Msb, K,) but the former alone is mentioned by Th in the Fs, and is the chaste word, (TA,) arabicized, from the Persian بَاهَا, (S,) <i>A sort,</i> or <i>species,</i> (S, K,) of food, or viands. (S.) Hence the saying, اِجْعَلِ البَاْجَات بَاـْجاً وَاحِدًا [<i>Make thou the sorts,</i> or <i>species,</i> of food, or viands, to be <i>one sort,</i> or <i>species</i>]: (S, K:) occurring in a trad., in which it is without ء in each case, accord. to IDrst: several different sorts of food being brought to &#39;Omar, he asked respecting them, and it was said, [They are] سِكْبَاج and زِرْبَاج and اـِسْفِيدْبَاج; whereupon he ordered that the bowls should be brought, and their contents were emptied into one; he saying the words above. (Marginal note in a copy of the S.) IKh says that a man would bring various sorts [of food], and one would say, اِجْعَلْهَا باْجاً وَاحدِا [<i>Make thou them</i> to be <i>one sort</i>]. (TA.) The pl. is [بَاْجَاتٌ, as shown above, as though the sing. were بَاْجَةٌ, and] اَبْوَاجٌ. (Msb, TA.) لَاَجْعَلَنَّ النَّاسَ كُلَّهُمْ بَاْجًا وَاحِدًا is [likewise] a saying of &#39;Omar, (Msb, TA,) meaning [<i>I will assuredly make the people, all of them, to be</i>] <i>one body</i> or <i>assemblage;</i> <br>\
                  بَاْجٌ signifying <i>a state of assembling,</i> or <i>collecting together:</i> (Kz, TA:) or [<i>of</i>] <i>one uniform way</i> or <i>mode</i> or <i>manner,</i> (Msb, TA,) as El-Fihree says in the Expos. of the Fs, on the authority of ISd in the book entitled El-&#39;Awees; (TA;) i. e., in respect of gifts, or allowances: (Msb:) accord. to IAar, it is from بَاْجٌ or بَاجٌ signifying <i>a uniform line of road.</i> (TA.) You say also, النَّاسُ بَاْجٌ وَاحِدٌ <br>\
                  <i>The people are</i> [<i>as</i>] <i>one thing.</i> (TA.) And هُمْ فِى اَمْرٍ بَاْجٍ <br>\
                  <i>They are</i> [<i>in one and the same,</i> or] <i>in an equal,</i> or <i>a uniform, case.</i> (K.) And جَعَلَ الكَلَامَ بَاْجاً <br>\
                  وَاخِدًا <br>\
                  <i>He made the speech,</i> or <i>language, to be</i> [<i>uniform,</i> or] <i>of one mode,</i> or <i>manner.</i> (TA.) And اِجْعَلْ هٰذا الشَّىْءَ بَاْجًا وَاحِدًا <br>\
                  <i>Make thou this thing to be</i> [<i>uniform,</i> or] <i>of one way,</i> or <i>mode,</i> or <i>manner.</i> (ISk.) And اِجْعَلِ الاَمْرَ بَاْجًا وَاحِدًا <br>\
                  <i>Make thou the affair,</i> or <i>case,</i> [<i>uniform,</i> or] <i>one uniform thing.</i> (Fr.)   </entryFree> <br>\
