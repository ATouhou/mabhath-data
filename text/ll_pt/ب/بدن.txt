                   The <i>body, without the head and arms and legs;</i> (M, Msb, K;) so says Az: (Msb:) or the <i>body without the arms and legs:</i> (Mgh:) or [the <i>part</i>] <i>from the shoulder-joint to the posteriors</i> [<i>inclusive</i>]: (TA [as from the Mgh, in my copy of which it is not found]:) or the جَسَدَ [generally meaning the <i>body together with the members</i>] of a man; (S;) often applied. to the <i>whole of the</i> <br>\
                  جَسَد; (Az, TA;) and in the Kur x. 92 it is said to mean the <i>body without soul:</i> (S:) pl. اَبْدَانٌ; (M, Msb;) whence the phrase, mentioned by Lh, اـِنَّهَا لَحَسَنَةُ الاَبْدَانِ [meaning <i>Verily she is beautiful in respect of the body</i>], as though the term بَدَنٌ were applied to every portion of her. (M.) شِرْكَةُ الاَبْدَانِ is originally شِرْكَةٌ بِالاَبْدَانِ, meaning <i>Copartnership in bodily labours for the acquirement of gains.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b2-  And hence, (tropical:)  The <i>part</i> of a shirt, (Mgh, Msb,) and of a [garment of the kind called] جُبَّة, (Mgh,) <i>that lies against the back and the belly,</i> [i. e. the <i>body</i> thereof,] <i>without the sleeves and the</i> <br>\

                  دِرْع: (M:) and so it is said to mean in the Kur x. 92 by IAar (T) and by Th; (M;) but Akh says that this assertion is of no account: (S:) pl. as above.

      بَادِنٌ and ↓ <br>\
