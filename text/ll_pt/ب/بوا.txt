(TA.) وَبَاوُوا بِغَضَبٍ مِنَ اْللّٰهِ [in the Kur ii. 58 and iii. 108] means <i>And they returned with anger from God;</i> (Akh, S, Bd in ii. 58, and Jel in the same and in iii. 108;) i. e. the anger of God came upon them: (Akh, S:) or <i>they returned deserving anger from God:</i> (Bd in iii. 108:) or <i>they became deserving of anger from God:</i> from بَا=ءَ فُلَانٌ بِفُلَانٍ <br>\

                  وَ اـِثْمِكَ, in the Kur v. 35, means <i>Verily I desire that thou return</i> [laden] <i>with the sin committed against me</i> in slaying me, <i>and thy sin</i> which thou hast committed previously: (Jel:) or <i>I desire that thou shouldst bear</i> (تَحْمِلَ) <i>my sin</i> if I were to extend my hand towards thee, <i>and thy sin</i> in extending thy hand towards me: or <i>the sin committed against me</i> in slaying me, <i>and thy sin</i> for which thine offering was not accepted: and each noun is in the place of a denotative of state; i. e., [it means] <i>that thou return involved in the two sins; bearing them:</i> and perhaps the speaker may have meant, if that must inevitably take place, I desire that it may be thine act, not mine; so that the real meaning is, that it should not be his, not that it should be his brother&#39;s: or by the اـِثْمٌ may be meant the <i>punishment</i> thereof; for the desire of the punishment of the disobedient is allowable: (Bd:) accord. to Th, the meaning is, if thou have determined upon slaying me, the sin will be in thee, not in me. (M.) فَبَاوُوا بِغَضَبٍ عَلَى غَضَبٍ <br>\
                   [in the Kur ii. 84] is explained by Aboo-Is-hák as meaning <i>So they bore the burden of anger upon anger;</i> syn. اِحْتَمَلُوا; this being said by him to be the proper signification of the verb: or, as some say, the meaning is, [<i>they bore the burden of</i>] <i>sin for which they deserved the fire</i> [<i>of Hell</i>] <i>following upon sin for which they deserved the same:</i> or <i>they returned</i> [laden <i>with anger upon anger</i>]: (T:) or <i>they became deserving of anger upon anger.</i> (Ksh.) [See a similar phrase, also from the Kur, above.] It is said in a form of prayer, اَبُوْءُ اـِلَيْكَ بِنِعْمَتِكَ, meaning <i>I acknowledge,</i> or <i>confess, to Thee thy favour</i> [towards me, as imposing an obligation upon me]. (Mgh.) You say also, بَا=ءٌ بِحَقِّهِ; (S;) and بِدِّمِهِ; (M, K;) <i>He acknowledged,</i> or <i>confessed,</i> [<i>himself to be answerable, responsible,</i> or <i>accountable, for</i>] <i>his right, due,</i> or <i>just claim;</i> (S;) and so [<i>for</i>] <i>his blood:</i> (M, K:) the verb expresses acknowledgment, or confession, always of something for which its agent is, as it were, indebted, or answerable; not the contrary. (S.) ―         -b4-  بَا=ءَ بِكَفِّى, in a poem of Sakhr-el-Gheí, means <i>It</i> [referring to a sword] <i>became in my hand; my hand became to it a</i> <br>\
                  مَبَا=ءَة, i. e. مَاْوًى [or <i>place of abode</i>]; <i>it returned, and became in my hand:</i> or, accord. to Ibn- Habeeb, <i>i. q.</i> <br>\

(Skr p. 16.)       -A2-  بَا=ءٌ also signifies <i>It</i> (a thing, TA) <i>suited, matched, tallied, corresponded,</i> or <i>agreed.</i> (K.) [Hence,] بَا=ءَ فُلَانٌ بِفُلَانٍ (inf. n. بَوَا=ءٌ, TA) <i>Such a one was the like,</i> or <i>equal, of such a one, to be slain</i> [<i>in retaliation</i>] <i>for him:</i> (T:) or <i>became his like,</i> or <i>equal, so that he was slain</i> [<i>in retaliation</i>] <i>for him:</i> (Mgh:) and <i>was slain for him,</i> (AZ, T, S,) <i>and his blood became a compensation for the blood of the other:</i> (T:) or <i>was deserving of being,</i> or <i>fit to be, slain in retaliation for him,</i> (Ksh and Bd in ii. 58,) <i>because his equal:</i> (Ksh ibid.:) or <i>was slain for him, and so became equal with him;</i> (K, * TA;) as also ↓ <br>\

      بَاوَاَهُ. (M, K.) One says, بُوْبِهِ, i. e. <i>Be thou of such as are slain</i> [<i>in retaliation</i>] <i>for him.</i> (S.) And it is said in a prov., بَا=ءَتْ عَرَارِ بِكَحْلٍ <br>\
                  <i>&#39;Arári became slain for Kahl:</i> these were two cows, which smote each other with their horns, and both died: the proverb is applied to any two that become equal. (S in this art.; and the same and K in art. عر. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab.
