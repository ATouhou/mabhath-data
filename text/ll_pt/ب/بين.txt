                  اَبْقَعُ [i. e. <i>in which is blackness and whiteness;</i> or <i>having whiteness in the breast</i>]; (S, K;) so described by the poet &#39;Antarah: (S:) or <i>that which is red in the beak and legs;</i> but the black is called الحَاتِمُ, because it makes [or shows] separation to be absolutely unavoidable, (Abu-1-Ghowth, S, K,) according to the assertion of the Arabs, i. e., by its croak: (Msb in art. حتم:) [or it is <i>any species of the corvus:</i>] Hamzeh says, in his Proverbs, that this name attaches to the غراب because, when the people of an abode go away to seek after herbage, it alights in the place of their tents, searching the sweepings: (Har p. 308:) but accord. to the Kádee of Granada, Aboo-&#39;Abd-Allah Esh-Shereef, this appellation, so often occurring in poetry, properly signifies <i>camels that transport people from one district,</i> or <i>country, to another;</i> and he cites the following verses: <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

[Hence ذَاتُ البَيْنِ as meaning <i>The state of union</i> or <i>concord</i> or <i>friendship</i> or <i>love subsisting between a people</i> or <i>between two parties;</i> this being likewise the contr. of a signification assigned to the same expression above: whence the phrase, اـِفْسَادُ ذَاتِ البَيْنِ (occurring in the S and K in art. ابر, and often elsewhere,) <i>The marring,</i> or <i>disturbance, of the state of union</i> or <i>concord</i> &amp;amp;c.: and] hence the saying, سَعَى فُلَانٌ لِاـِصْلَاحِ ذَاتِ البَيْنِ مِنْ عَشِيرَتِهِ [<i>Such a one laboured for the improving of the state of union</i> or <i>concord</i> &amp;amp;c. <i>of his kinsfolk;</i> but in this instance, the meaning given in the second sentence of this paragraph seems to be more appropriate]. (Ham p. 569.) ―         -b2-  ذَاتُ بَيْنِهِمْ may also be used as meaning <i>The vacant space</i> (سَاحَة) <i>that is between their houses,</i> or <i>tents.</i> (Ham p. 195.)       -A3-  بَيْن is also an adverbial noun, [as such written بَيْنَ,] (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) capable of being used as a noun absolutely: (M, K:) it relates only to that which has space, as a country; or to that which has some number, either two or more, as two men, and a company of men; and denotes [intervention in] the interval between two things, or the middle, or midst, of two things, (Er-Rághib, TA,) or the middle of a collective number: (S:) [thus it signifies <i>Between,</i> and <i>amidst,</i> and <i>among:</i>] its meaning is [therefore] vague, not apparent unless it is prefixed to two or more [words, or to a word signifying two or more], or to what supplies the place of such a complement: (Msb:) it must necessarily be prefixed, and may not be otherwise than in the manners just explained: (Mgh:) [i. e.] it may not be prefixed to any noun but such as denotes more than one, or to a noun that has another conjoined to it by و, (M,) not by any other conjunction, (M, Msb,) acc0ord. to the usage commonly obtaining. (Msb.) You say بَيْنَ الرَّجُلَيْنِ [<i>Between the two men</i>]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and المَالُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ [<i>The property is between the company of men</i>]: (M, Msb, Er-Rághib: *) and المَالُ بَيْنَ زَيْدٍ وَعَمْرٍو [<i>The property is between Zeyd and &#39;Amr</i>]: and هُوَ <br>\

[<i>In,</i> or <i>during, the space of</i> (<i>several</i>) <i>days</i>]: and عَوَانٌ بَيْنَ ذٰلِكَ, in the Kur [ii. 63], is an ex. of its being prefixed to a single word supplying the place of more than one; (Mgh, Msb;) the meaning being, <i>Of middle age, between that</i> which has been mentioned; namely, the فَارِض and the بِكْر. (Bd.) Some allow that two words to the former of which بَيْنَ is prefixed may be connected by فَ, citing as an evidence the phrase used by Imra-el-Keys, بَيْنَ الدَّخُولِ فَحَوْمَلِ [as though meaning <i>Between Ed-Dakhool and Howmal</i>]: but to this it has been replied that الدخول is a name applying to several places; so that the phrase [means <i>amidst Ed-Dakhool</i> &amp;amp;c., and] is similar to the saying, المَالُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ [mentioned above, or جَلَسْتُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ, also mentioned above]. (Msb.) [You say also, بَيْنَ اَظْهُرِهِمْ, and بَيْنَ ظَهْرَيْهِمْ &amp;amp;c., meaning <i>In the midst of them.</i> (See art. ظهر.) And بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ, and بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِمْ, meaning <i>Before him,</i> and <i>before them.</i> <br>\
                  بَيْن is also often used absolutely as a noun: thus it is in the Kur lxxxvi. 7, يَخْرُجُ مِنْ بَيْنِ الصُّلْبِ وَالتَّرَايِبِ <br>\
                  <i>Coming</i> <br>\

                  <i>And we have placed before them</i> (lit. <i>between their hands</i>) <i>a barrier.</i>] It is said in the Kur [vi. 94], لَقَدْ تَقَطَّعَ بَيْنُكُمْ, as some read; or بَيْنَكُمْ, as others: (T, S, M:) the former means <i>Verily your union hath become dissevered:</i> (AA, T, S, M:) the latter, <i>that which was between you;</i> (مَا بَيْنَكُمْ, Ibn-Mes&#39;ood, T, S, or اْلَّذِى كَانَ <br>\
                  بَيْنَكُمْ, IAar, T;) or <i>the state wherein ye were, in respect of partnership among you:</i> (Zj, T:) or <i>the state of circumstances,</i> or <i>the bond,</i> or <i>the love,</i> or <i>affection,</i> [<i>formerly subsisting</i>] <i>among you,</i> or <i>between you;</i> or, accord. to Akh, بَيْنَكُمْ, though in the accus. case as to the letter, is in the nom. case as to the place, by reason of the verb, and the adverbial termination is retained only because the word is commonly used as an adv. n.: (M:) AHát disapproved of the latter reading; but wrongly, because what is suppressed accord. to this reading is implied by what precedes in the same verse. (T.) ―         -b2-  [It is often used as a partitive, or distributive; as also مَا بَيْنَ: for ex.,] you say, هُمْ بَيْنَ حَاذِفٍ وَقَاذِفٍ, (S and TA in art. قذف,) or هُمْ مَا بَيْنَ حَاذفٍ وقاذفٍ, (TA in art. حذف,) i. e. [<i>They are partly,</i> or <i>in part,</i>] <i>beating with the staff,</i> or <i>stick, and</i> [<i>partly,</i> or <i>in part,</i>] <i>pelting with stones;</i> [or <i>some beating</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>and the others pelting</i> &amp;amp;c.] (S and TA, both in art. قذف, and the latter in art. حذف.) [See also an ex. in a verse cited voce خَيْطَةٌ.] ―         -b3-  هٰذَا بَيْنَ بَيْنَ means <i>This</i> (namely, a thing, S, or a commodity, Msb) <i>is between good and bad:</i> (S, Msb, K:) or <i>of a middling,</i> or <i>middle, sort:</i> (M:) these two words being two nouns made one, and indecl., with fet-h for their terminations, (S, Msb, K,) like خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ. (Msb.) الهَمْزَةُ المُخَفَّفَةُ [i. e. the hemzeh uttered lightly] is called هَمْزَةٌ بَيْنَ بَيْنَ, (S, M, K, *) i. e. <i>A hemzeh that is between the hemzeh and the soft letter whence is its vowel;</i> (S, M;) or هَمْزَةُ بَيْنِ بَيْنٍ, the first بين with kesreh but without tenween, and the second with tenween, (Sharh Shudhoor edh-Dhahab,) [i. e. <i>the hemzeh</i> &amp;amp;c.:] if it is with fet-h, it is between the hemzeh and the alif, as in سَاَلَ, (S, M,) for سَاَلَ; (M;) if with kesr, it is between the hemzeh and the yé, as in سَيِمَ, (S, M,) for سَيِمَ; (M;) and if with damm, it is between the hemzeh and the wáw, as in لَوُمَ, (S, M,) for لَوُمَ: (M:) it is never at the beginning of a word, because of its nearness, by reason of feebleness, to the letter that is quiescent, (S, M,) though, notwithstanding this, it is really movent: (S:) it is thus called because it is weak, (Sb, S, M,) not having the power of the hemzeh uttered with its proper sound, nor the clearness of the letter whence is its vowel.

(TA.) ―         -b4-  ↓ <br>\
      بَيْنَا and ↓ <br>\
      بَيْنَمَا are of the number of inceptive حُرُوف: (M, K:) this is clear if by حروف is meant &quot;words:&quot; that they have become particles, no one says: they are still adv. ns.: (MF, TA:) the former is بَيْنَ with its [final] fet-hah rendered full in sound; and hence the ا; (Mughnee in the section next after that of وا, and K;) [i. e.,] it is of the measure فَعْلَى [or فَعْلَا] from البَيْن, the [final] fet-hah being rendered full in sound, and so becoming ا; and the latter is بَيْنَ with مَا [restrictive of its government] added to it; and both have the same meaning [of <i>While,</i> or <i>whilst</i>]: (S:) or the ا in the former is the restrictive ا; or, as some say, it is a portion of the restrictive ما [in the latter]: (Mughnee ubi suprà:) and these do not exclude بَيْنَ from the category of nouns, but only cut it off from being prefixed to another noun: (MF, TA:) they are substitutes for that to which بَيْنَ would otherwise be prefixed: (Mgh:) some say that these two words are adv. ns. of time, denoting a thing&#39;s happening suddenly, or unexpectedly; and they are prefixed to a proposition consisting of a verb and an agent, or an inchoative and enunciative; so that they require a complement to complete the meaning. (TA.) One says, بَيْنَا <br>\

(Skr, S, K.) Mbr says that when the noun following بينا is a real subst., it is put in the nom. case as an inchoative; but when it is an inf. n., or a noun of the inf. kind, it is put in the gen., and بينا in this instance has the meaning of بَيْنَ: and Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà says the like, but some persons of chaste speech treat the latter kind of noun like the former: after بينما, however, each kind of noun must be in the nom. case.

                   is originally the inf. n. of بَانَ as syn. with تَبَيَّنَ, and so signifies The <i>being</i> [<i>distinct</i> or] <i>apparent</i> &amp;amp;c.; (Kull;) or it is a subst. in this sense: (Msb:) or a subst. from بَيَّنَ, [and so signifies the <i>making distinct</i> or <i>apparent</i> &amp;amp;c.,] being like سَلَامٌ and كَلَامٌ from سَلَّمَ and كَلَّمَ.
