Hist. p. 273, finding fault with those who say otherwise;) and they affirm that this is done for the purpose of lessening the libidinous passion: such, indeed, appears to be the case in some instances, but not generally; and it may have led to a misapplication of the term بظر in post-classical times: an analogous practice, one still more barbarous, is said to have obtained among an African race hence called the Colobi: see بَرْبَرُ: Abu-l-Kásim Ez-Zahráwee speaks of the amputation of the redundance of the بظر when preternaturally large, and also of an excrescence in the vulva: the former he describes in such a manner as plainly shows that he means thereby the <i>clitoris:</i> the latter, in terms apparently indicating a preternatural elongation of the lower part of the prepuce of the clitoris; as “ an excrescence of flesh at, or in, the mouth of the vulva, such as fills it up, and sometimes protrudes externally, like a tail, wherefore the ancients term it the caudal disease المرض الذنبى; and this, ” he says, “ should be amputated, like as the بظر is amputated ” when preternaturally large: (Albucasis de Chirurgia, pp. 314 and 316:) in some of our medical books, the term “ caudatio ” is defined as “ an elongation of the clitoris; ” inconsistently with the foregoing description of “ the caudal disease: ”] the pl. [of mult.] of بَظْرٌ is بُظُورٌ, (M, Msb, K,) and [pl. of pauc.] اَبْظُرٌ. (Msb.) يَا اْبْنَ <br>\
