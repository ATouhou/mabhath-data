      بَايَدَ, (L, K,) or بَايِدَ, (so in the Mughnee and in a MS. copy of the K and in the CK, and in a MS. copy of the K omitted,) a noun inseparably prefixed to اَنَّ with its complement, (Mughnee,) used as <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  غَيْر, (Ks, T, S, M, &amp;amp;c.,) but never otherwise than in the accus. case, nor as an epithet, nor otherwise than as an exceptive in a case in which the thing excepted is disunited in kind from that from which the exception is made. (Mughnee.) You say, هُوَ كَثِيرُ المَالِ بَيْدَ اَنَّهُ بَخِيلٌ <br>\
                  <i>He is possessed of abundant,</i> or <i>much, wealth, but he is niggardly.</i> (ISk, S, M, A, Msb, Mughnee.) ―         -b2-  Also as <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  عَلَى, (M, K,) as some say; (A&#39;Obeyd, M;) but to render it in the former manner is preferable. (M.) Accord. to some, (L,) it is syn. with عَلَى in the following trad.: نَحْنُ الا=خِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ القيَامَةِ بَيْدَ اَنَّهُمْ اُوتُو <br>\
                  الكِتَابَ مِنْ قَبْلِنَا وَ اُوتِينَاهُ مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ [<i>We, the latter</i> people, <i>shall be those who will precede on the day of resurrection, although they were given the Scripture before us, and we were given it after them</i>]: (T, L:) El-Umawee holds it to be so: (T:) but Ks says that it here signifies غَيْر [as in the former ex.]: (T, L: [and so says IHsh in the Mughnee:]) accord. to one recital, it is بايَد; (L;) or بَايِدَ; so in the Musnad of the Imám Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee: (Mughnee:) IAth says, I have not found this in the classical language in the sense of عَلَى: some say that it is بِاَيْدٍ, i. e. <i>by means of strength,</i> or <i>power;</i> and that the meaning is, <i>we shall be those who will precede</i> to Paradise <i>on the day of resurrection by means of strength,</i> or <i>power,</i> given us by God. (L.) ―         -b3-  Also, [accord. to some,] as <i>meaning</i> <br>\
                  مِنْ اَجْلِ: (L, Mughnee, K:) as in the saying of Mohammad, اَنَا اَفْصَحُ العَرَبِ بَيْدَ اَنِّى مِنْ قُرَيْشٍ وَنَشَاْتُ <br>\
                  فِى بَنِى سَعْدٍ [<i>I am the most chaste in speech of the Arabs because I am of the tribe of Kureysh and I grew up among the children of Saad</i>]: (T, L: [in the Mughnee given somewhat differently:]) but Ibn-Málik and others say that it here, also, means غير, after the manner in which the latter is used in the saying [of a poet], <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَلَا عَيْبَ فِيهِمْ غَيْرَ اَنَّ سُيُوفَهُمْ<br>\

                  </quote> [And there is no blemish in them, save that their swords have in them notches from the conflicting of the troops]. (Mughnee.) This manner of praising is termed by Abu-l-&#39;Abbás Mohammad Ibn-Yezeed اِسْتِثْبَاتٌ. (Ham p. 474.) ―         -b4-  مَيْدَ is also a dial. var. of the same.
