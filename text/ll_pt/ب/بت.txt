      اَبِتُّوا, i. e. <i>Decide ye the affair respecting the marriage of these women, and confirm it by its [proper] conditions:</i> an oblique prohibition of the kind of marriage termed نِكَاحُ المُتْعَةِ, because it is a marriage not [absolutely or lawfully] decided, [being] made definite as to duration.
