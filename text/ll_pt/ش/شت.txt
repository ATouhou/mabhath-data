      شَتَاتٌ is [similar in meaning, being] likewise an inf. n. of 1; (S, A, K;) or it is a subst. from the intrans. verb شَتَّ, (Msb,) and signifies <i>a state of separation</i> or <i>disunion;</i> as in the saying, اَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمُ الشَّتَاتَ [<i>I fear for you separation,</i> or <i>disunion</i>].

                  , (K, TA, but omitted in the CK,) with damm to the ن of بين, (TA,) [<i>Different,</i> or <i>distinct, are they two:</i> or <i>widely different</i> or <i>distinct are they two:</i> or <i>how very,</i> or <i>widely, different</i> or <i>distinct, are they two!</i> lit., <i>the union of them two is severed:</i> or <i>the interval between them two is far-extending,</i> or <i>wide:</i> or <i>how greatly is the union of them two severed!</i> as will be shown below.] AZ quotes, in his “ Nawádir, ” with بين in the nom. case, the following verse: <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>Different,</i> or <i>widely different,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>are they two in every predicament: this fears, and this hopes, ever</i>]. (TA.) The mansoob form, however, is also employed (K, TA, but omitted in the CK) by some of the Arabs in the above-mentioned phrase, so that one says, شَتَّانَ بَيْنَهُمَا, مَا being understood, as though one said, شَتَّ الَّذِى بَيْنَهُمَا [meaning, as above explained, <i>Different,</i> or <i>widely different,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>are they two:</i> lit., <i>separated,</i> or <i>disunited,</i> or <i>severed, is that which is between them two:</i> or <i>far-extending,</i> or <i>wide, is the interval between them two:</i> or <i>how greatly separated,</i> or <i>severed, is the union between them two!</i>]: Hassán Ibn-Thábit says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

In like manner also, [but with ما,] one says, شَتَّانَ مَا بَيْنَهُمَا, (A, Msb, K,) accord. to Th. (TA.) This [as also, consequently, the same phrase without ما] is disallowed by As and IKt: IB, however, says that this phrase occurs in the verses of chaste Arabs: for instance, Abu-l-Aswad EdDuälee says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  مَا هُمَا; (S, A, K;) and شَتَّانَ مَا عَمْرٌو وَاَخُوهُ; (S, K;) <i>Different,</i> or <i>distinct,</i> or <i>widely different,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>are they two;</i> and <i>&#39;Amr and his brother:</i> [lit., <i>separate,</i> or <i>distinct, are they two;</i> &amp;amp;c.: or <i>remote are they two, one from the other;</i> &amp;amp;c.:] or <i>how greatly,</i> or <i>widely, are they two separated;</i> &amp;amp;c.! (S, A, K:) here ما is redundant; and in the former phrase, هما is the agent of شتّان; as is the former of the two nouns, to which the latter noun is conjoined, in the latter phrase. (TA.)

(S, TA.) And in like manner, [but without ما,] one says, شَتَّانَ اَخُوهُ وَاَبُوهُ [<i>Different,</i> or <i>widely different,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>are his brother and his father</i>]. (TA.) [See also an ex. in a verse cited voce دَايِمٌ, in art. دوم.] ―         -b2-  شَتَّانَ, is a preterite verbal noun, signifying اِفْتَرَقَ, [and so expl. above,] accord. to many authorities, [including most of the grammarians,] and therefore they have made it a condition that its agent must be what denotes more than one: [for اشترطوا فى فعله التردّد, I read اشترطوا فى <br>\
                  فاعلهُ التعدّد, which agrees with what is afterwards said in the TA and here; though the former phrase may be so rendered as to convey essentially the same meaning: but this condition is not necessary if we render شتّان by بَعُدَ:] (TA:) or it signifies تَبَاعَدَ and اِفْتَرَقَ; (Ibn-Umm-Kásim;) or بَعُدَ; [and so expl. above;] (S, A, Msb, K;) and is inflected from شَتُتَ; (S, K;) [which is a verb not used; in the CK, incorrectly, شَتَتَ;] the fet-hah of the ن being the fet-hah originally pertaining to the [final] ت [of the verb]; and this fet-hah shows the word to be inflected from the preterite verb, like as سَرْعَانَ is from سَرُعَ, and وَشْكَانَ from وَشُكَ: (S:) or, accord. to Er-Radee, it implies wonder, [like several verbs of the measure فَعُلَ, as shown in remarks on هَيُوَ &amp;amp;c.,] and means <i>how greatly separated, disunited,</i> or <i>severed,</i> &amp;amp;c.! (TA:) or, accord. to El-Marzookee and Hr and Zj and some others, it is an inf. n.: El-Marzookee says, in his Expos. of the Fs, that it is an inf. n. of a verb not used, [namely شَتُتَ,] and is indecl., with fet-hah for its termination, because it is put in the place of a pret. verb, being equivalent to شَتَّ, [for شَتُتَ,] i. e., تَشَتَّتَ اَوْ تَفَرَّقَ جِدًّا [as expl. above]: and Zj says that it is an inf. n. occupying the place of a verb, of the measure فَعْلَان, and therefore indecl., because differing thus from others of its class: Aboo-&#39;Othmán El-Mázinee says that شَتَّان and سُبْحَان may receive tenween, whether they be substs, or occupying the place of substs.: upon which AAF observes that if شتّان be in its proper place, it is a verbal noun, meaning شَتَّ: if with tenween, it is indeterminate; if without tenween, determinate; and if translated from its office of a verbal noun, and made a subst. answering to التَّشْتِيتُ, and determinate, it is similar to سبحان in the phrase سُبْحَانَ مِنْ عَلْقَمَةَ <br>\
                  الفَاخِرِ, which is a subst. answering to التَّنْزِيهُ. (TA.) The ن in شَتَّان (sometimes, TA) receives kesreh; (K;) though this is contr. to what is said by AZ and by IDrst: its being sometimes with kesreh is mentioned by Th, on the authority of Fr: and Er-Radee seems to infer that its being so was an opinion of As; and gives two reasons for his disallowal of the expression شتّان ما بين; first, because شتّان occurs with kesr to the ن; and second, because its agent cannot be otherwise than what denotes more than one: [but see what has been observed above on this point:] IAmb says that one must not say شَتَّانِ مَا بَيْنَ اَخِيكَ وَاَبِيكَ, because, in this case, شتّان [virtually] governs only one noun in the nom. case: but that one may say, شَتَّانِ اَخُوكَ وَاَبُوكَ, and شَتَّانِ مَا اَخُوكَ وَاَبُوكَ, using شَتَّانِ as the dual of شَتٌّ; though correctly شتّان is a verbal noun: MF, however, observes that the Expositors of the Fs seem to say that Fr makes شَتَّانِ to be the dual of شَتٌّ; but that he only mentions it as a dial. var. of شَتَّانَ: the following is adduced as an ex. <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        لَشَتَّانَ مَا اَنْوِى وَيَنْوِى بَنُو اَبِى<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>Different,</i> or <i>widely different,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>are that which I intend and that which the sons of my father intend</i>]: in which شتّان is read with both fet-hah and kesreh: and it is said in the O that شَتَّانِ is a dial. var. of شَتَّانَ. (TA.) ―         -b3-  IJ mentions ↓ <br>\
      شَتَّى as an accidental syn. of شتّان; and says that it is not the fem. of the latter: therefore the assertion of some, that it is used by poetical license in the following verse of Jemeel requires consideration: <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
