(IAth, L.) You say also, شَرَدَ عَنِّى فُلَانٌ <br>\
                  <i>Such a one fled,</i> or <i>went away</i> or <i>aside</i> or <i>apart</i> or <i>to a distance, from me;</i> syn. نَفَرَ. (A.) [Or] شَرَدَ said of a man, inf. n. شُرُودٌ, means <i>He departed, driven away.</i> (L.) And you say, شَرَدَ عَلَى اْللّٰهِ, meaning <i>He departed from obedience to God, and seceded,</i> or <i>separated himself from the community</i> [<i>of the faithful</i>]. (L.)    </entryFree> <br>\
