      اشتان. (K.) ―         -b2-  And اِشْاَنْ شَاْنَكَ <br>\
                  <i>Do thou what thou dost well.</i> (S, L, K. *) And <i>Keep thou to thy affair.</i> (IAar, L.) ―         -b3-  And مَا شَاَنَ شَاْنَهُ <br>\
                  <i>He did not know,</i> or <i>had not knowledge of, him,</i> or <i>his affair</i> or <i>case</i> or <i>state:</i> (Lh, IAar, L, K:) [from a passage in the L, imperfectly written, it seems, accord. to Lh, to be said of one who does what another likes or dislikes, app. without regard to his liking it or disliking it, agreeably with what here follows:] or (K) this means, (S, K,) or means also, (L,) <i>he did not care for, mind, heed,</i> or <i>regard, him.</i> (S, L, K. [In the S and L, the verb in the sense thus expl. is in the first pers.: and in one place in the L it is expl. by اَرَادَ, which often has this meaning.]) One says also, لَاَشْاَننَّ شَاْنَهُمْ, meaning <i>I will assuredly know,</i> or <i>try, prove,</i> or <i>test,</i> (لَاَخْبُرَنَّ,) <i>their affair</i> or <i>case</i> or <i>state:</i> (L:) or this means <i>I will assuredly corrupt,</i> or <i>pervert,</i> or <i>mar, their affair</i> or <i>case</i> or <i>state:</i> (S, L, K: *) and لَاَشْاَنَنَّ <br>\
                  خَبَرَهُ, (L,) or خَبَرَهُمْ, (K,) means <i>I will assuredly know,</i> or <i>try, prove,</i> or <i>test,</i> [<i>his,</i> or <i>their, state,</i> or] <i>him,</i> or <i>them.</i> (L, K. [In the CK and in my MS. copy of the K, لَاُخْبِرَنَّهُمْ, is erroneously put for لَاَخْبُرَنَّهُمْ.])       -A2-  شَاَنَ بَعْدَكَ means صَارَ لَهُ شَاْنٌ [i. e., app., <i>He became a person to whom importance attached</i> (accord. to the general meaning of لَهُ <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>A thing, an affair,</i> or <i>a business;</i> syn. اَمْرٌ; (S, L, K;) and خَطْبٌ [in the same sense, or in that next following]: (L, K:) <i>a great thing</i> or <i>affair:</i> (Har p. 274:) <i>state, condition, case, quality,</i> or <i>manner of being;</i> syn. حَالٌ: (S, L:) [also <i>property,</i> or <i>nature:</i> and <i>importance</i> attaching to a person or thing:] pl. شُوُونٌ and شِيَانٌ, (L, K,) the latter mentioned by IJ on the authority of AAF, and شُونٌ occurs in poetry for the former of these, or as another pl. originally شُوْنٌ, of the measure فُعْلٌ. (L.) It is said in the Kur [lv. 29], كُلَّ يَم ٍ هُوَ فِى شَاْن ٍ [<i>Every day He is</i> employing Himself <i>in an affair</i> of some kind]: expl. as meaning that, of his business (مِنْ شَاْنِهِ [which may also be rendered “ of his property ”]) it is to render mighty one who is brought low, and to bring low one who is mighty, and to enrich one who is poor, and to impoverish one who is rich; and no affair occupies him so as to divert him from an affair (لَا يَشْعَلُهُ شَاْنٌ عَنْ شَاْن ٍ). (L.) [And one says, مَا شَاْنُكَ <br>\
                  <i>What is thy affair?</i> or <i>what is thy case?</i> And شَاْنَكَ, for اِشْاَنْ شَاْنَكَ i. e. <i>Pursue thy way</i> or <i>course,</i> or <i>thy affair;</i> or <i>do what thou dost well;</i> or <i>keep to thy affair:</i> or the like: and to this is often added, وَمَا تُرِيدُ i. e. <i>and what thou wilt,</i> or <i>wishest,</i> or <i>desirest.</i> And مِنْ شَاْنِهِ اَنْ <br>\
                  يَفْعَلَ كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>It is of his business,</i> or <i>of his property,</i> or <i>nature, to do,</i> or <i>that he should do, such a thing.</i> And رَجُلٌ سَهْلُ الشَّاْنِ (a phrase occurring in the S and K in art. هش) <i>A man of easy nature.</i> And لَهُ شَاْنٌ, sometimes meaning <i>There is for him,</i> or <i>he has, a great thing</i> or <i>affair</i> to perform or transact: but more commonly, <i>great importance attaches to him,</i> or <i>to it:</i> see 1, last sentence. And a grandee, or a prince, is said to be عَظِيمُ الشَّاْنِ i. e. <i>Of great importance</i> or <i>rank</i> or <i>dignity.</i>]       -A2-  Also [<i>A suture of the skull;</i> i. e.] the <i>place of junction of the</i> <br>\
                  قَبَايِل [or <i>principal bones,</i> namely, the <i>frontal, occipital,</i> and <i>two parietal, bones,</i>] <i>of the head:</i> (K:) sing. of شُوُونٌ, (Mgh,) which signifies the <i>places of junction,</i> (As, S, Mgh, L,) and <i>of meeting,</i> (S, L,) <i>of the</i> <br>\
                  قَبَايِل (As, S, Mgh, L) <i>of the head;</i> (S, L;) <i>between every two of which</i> <br>\

                  <i>is a</i> <br>\
                  شَاْن: (As, L:) [it is fancifully said that] from them come the tears: (As, S, L:) the pl. is also expl. as meaning the سَلَاسِل [i. e. <i>sutures</i> as being likened to the سلاسل (or lines) of writing] <i>that unite the</i> <br>\
                  قبايل: by Lth, as the نَمَانِم [likewise meaning <i>sutures resembling lines of writing</i>] <i>of the skull; between the</i> <br>\
                  قبايل: by AHát, as the شُعَب [meaning <i>serrated edges</i>] <i>that unite the</i> <br>\
                  قبايل <br>\
                  <i>of the head.</i> (L.) ―         -b2-  And The <i>channel by which the tears flow,</i> or <i>run, to the eye:</i> pl. [of pauc.] اَشْوُنٌ and [of mult.] شُوُونٌ: (L, K:) [perhaps thus called because supposed to come from the sutures of the skull: but they may have been supposed to come thence because tears are called مَا=ءُ الشُّوُونِ (as in a verse cited voce رَسَمَ); for this phrase may have been misunderstood as signifying “ the water of the sutures of the skull, ” whereas it seems to be properly rendered “ the water of the channels of the tears: ”] it is said that the شُوُون connect the قبايل of the head [expl. above] to the eye: Lth says that they are the <i>ducts</i> (عُرُوق) <i>of the tears from</i> [<i>the interior of</i>] <i>the head to the eye:</i> and Th, that they are <i>certain ducts</i> (عروق) <i>above the</i> <br>\
                  قبايل, <i>which become strong by degrees as the man advances in age:</i> (L: [but it seems that Th has confounded explanations of شوون in two different senses:]) accord. to ISk, (S,) or AA and others, (L,) the شَاْنَانِ are <i>two ducts</i> (عِرْقَانِ) <i>descending from</i> [<i>the upper part of</i>] <i>the head to the eyebrows and then to the eyes.</i> (S, L.) ―         -b3-  [The pl. شُوُونٌ is also expl. as though meaning <i>Tears</i> themselves, in a phrase mentioned voce ذَيِرٌ (q. v.), on the authority of the K.] ―         -b4-  And شُوُونٌ الخَمْرِ means (assumed tropical:)  <i>The effluvia of wine that creep</i> (مَا دَبَّ مِنَ الخَمْرِ) <i>in the veins of the body.</i> (L.) ―         -b5-  شَاْنٌ also signifies <i>A vein of earth in a mountain,</i> (L, K,) i. e. <i>a cleft therein,</i> (L,) <i>in which palm-trees are</i> <br>\
                  <i>planted;</i> (L, K;) or <i>in which trees of the kind called</i> <br>\

                  <i>grow;</i> or <i>that produces plants,</i> or <i>herbage:</i> (L:) pl. شُوُونٌ: (L, K:) which is said by ISd to mean <i>lines,</i> or <i>streaks, in a mountain:</i> or, as some say, <i>cracks,</i> or <i>clefts:</i> and to these cracks, or clefts, the poet Keys Ibn-Kuráa likens [imaginary] clefts in the liver, occasioned by love.
