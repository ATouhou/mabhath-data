      تشكّك signifies the same. (S, K.) ―         -b4-  شَكَّ عَلَىَّ <br>\
                  الاَمْرُ means شَقَّ [i. e. <i>The case,</i> or <i>affair, was difficult, hard, distressing,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>to me</i>]: (O, TA:) or, as some say, [<i>was such that</i>] <i>I doubted</i> (شَكَكْتُ) <i>respecting it.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  شَكَّ said of a camel, (IAar, S, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (S,) <i>He limped,</i> or <i>halted;</i> or <i>had a slight lameness,</i> (IAar, S, TA,) <i>of his hind leg:</i> (IAar, TA:) or <i>his arm stuck to his side,</i> (K, TA,) <i>and he had a slight lameness in consequence thereof:</i> (TA:) and ↓ <br>\

                  <i>I traversed,</i> or <i>crossed,</i> or <i>cut through, the countries,</i> or <i>districts, to him.</i> (O, TA.) ―         -b3-  And شُكَّ عَلَيِه الثَّوْبُ <br>\
                  <i>The garment was put</i> [or <i>drawn</i>] <i>together upon him, and fastened with a thorn</i> or <i>a wooden pin:</i> or <i>was let down,</i> or <i>made to hang down, upon him.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  شَكُّوا بُيُوتَهُمْ <br>\
                  <i>They placed their tents in one row,</i> or <i>series,</i> (O, Msb, K,) <i>in one regular order,</i> (T, TA,) <i>near together.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b5-  Hence; شَكُّوا <br>\

                  <i>They made the relationships to be closely connected.</i> (Msb.) And شُكَّ <br>\
                  <i>He was made,</i> or <i>asserted, to be connected with the lineage of another.</i> (IAar, O.) ―         -b6-  And شَكَكْتُهُ said of anything means <i>I drew and joined,</i> or <i>adjoined, it</i> [to another thing]. (Msb.) [And <i>I infixed it</i> in, or <i>thrust it</i> into, another thing.] ―         -b7-  مَا شَكَّ <br>\
                  كَفِى خَلِيلُهَا, [or, more probably, ما شُكَّ,] a phrase in a verse of El-Farezdak,] in which it forms an apodosis,] means مَا قَارَنَ [i. e., app., <i>Its friend</i> (<i>the sword,</i> or <i>the spear,</i> both of which are meanings of الخَلِيل,) <i>would not be conjoined</i> (or <i>grasped</i>) <i>with my hand</i>].

                  <i>He</i> (the sewer) <i>made the stitch-holes far apart</i> [<i>in sewing the garment,</i> or <i>piece of cloth</i>]. (O, TA.) [Thus the verb has two contr. meanings.]       -A4-  شَكِكْتُ اـِلَيْهِ, with kesr, and شَكِكْتُهُ, (Ibn- &#39;Abbád, O, and so in the K accord. to the TA, as also in the TK, in the CK and in my MS. copy of the K شَكَكْتُهُ and اليه,) <i>I inclined to him,</i> or <i>it;</i> or <i>trusted to,</i> or <i>relied upon, him,</i> or <i>it, so as to be,</i> or <i>become, easy,</i> or <i>quiet, in mind;</i> or <i>leaned, rested,</i> or <i>relied, upon him,</i> or <i>it;</i> syn. رَكَنْتُ.
