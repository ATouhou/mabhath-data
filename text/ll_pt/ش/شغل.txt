      شغّلهُ signifies <i>he,</i> or <i>it, busied him,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>much;</i> i. e.] with teshdeed it denotes muchness: (Bd in xlviii. 11:) ↓ <br>\
      اشغلهُ is a good dial. var. of شَغَلَهُ; or is rare; or bad: (K:) accord. to IDrd [and J], (O,) one should not say اَشْغَلْتُهُ; (S, O;) for it is bad: (S:) accord. to IF, they scarcely ever say اَشْغَلْتُ, [thus in the O, but in the Msb ↓ <br>\
      اِشْتَغَلَ,] but it is allowable: (O:) none of the leading lexicologists is known to have pronounced it good. (TA.) [Hence the saying, شَغَلَتْ سَعَاتِى جَدْوَاىَ (see art. سعو and سعى), or, as some relate it, شغلت شِعَابِى جدواى (see art. شعب).] See another ex. voce شَاغِلٌ.

      تشاغل, (TA,) which likewise signifies تَلَهَّى [meaning as expl. above, or <i>he busied himself,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>so as to divert himself from him,</i> or <i>it</i>]: (TA in art. لهو, and Bd and Jel in lxxx. 10:) some disallow ↓ <br>\
      اِشْتَغَلَ, in the form of an active verb, but say اُشْتُغِلَ, in the form of a pass. verb; but it is originally quasi-pass of اَشْغَلْتُهُ, like as are اِحْتَرَقَ and اِكْتَهَلَ of اَحْرَقْتُهُ and اَكْهَلْتُهُ; [though why of اَشْغَلْتُهُ rather than of شَغَلْتُهُ, I do not see:] Az mentions the usage of its act. and pass. part. ns.: (Msb:) accord. to AHát and IDrd, one should not say ↓ <br>\
      اِشْتَغَلَ; but IF mentions, as transmitted from the Arabs, اُشْتُغِلَ فُلَانٌ بِالشَّىْءِ, and the pass. part. n.
