                     شَجَوَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. شَجًا, <i>He was choked;</i> or <i>his throat,</i> or <i>fauces, became obstructed;</i> (S, K;) بِهِ <br>\
                  <i>by it;</i> i. e. a bone or the like. (K.) One says, عَلَيْكَ بِالكَظْمِ وَلَوْ شَجِيتَ بِالعَظْمِ [<i>Keep thou to self-restraint though thou be choked by the bone</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  And, [hence, by a metaphor, (see Har p. 33,)] aor. and inf. n. as above, (assumed tropical:)  <i>He grieved, mourned,</i> or <i>lamented;</i> or <i>was sorrowful, sad,</i> or <i>unhappy:</i> (S, Msb:) and <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, anxious,</i> or <i>disquieted in mind.</i> (S.) ―         -b3-  Also, aor. and inf. n. as above, said of a creditor (غَرِيم), <i>He went away,</i> <br>\
                  عَنْهُ [<i>from him</i>]. (K. [See 4.])       -A2-  شَجَا بَيْنَهُمْ <br>\
                  <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, an occasion of contention,</i> or <i>dispute,</i> or <i>of disagreement,</i> or <i>difference, between them.</i> (K.)       -A3-  شَجَاهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.      <br>\
                     شَجُوَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. شَجْوٌ, (S, Msb,) [app. originally <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  اَشْجَاهُ in the first of the senses assigned to the latter in the next paragraph: ―         -b2-  and hence,] (assumed tropical:)  <i>It</i> (anxiety, Msb) <i>grieved him;</i> or <i>caused him to mourn</i> or <i>lament,</i> or <i>to be sorrowful</i> or <i>sad</i> or <i>unhappy;</i> (S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      اشجاهُ. (K.) And, said of wealth (الغِنَى), inf. n. شَجْوٌ, <i>It excited his griefs, mournings,</i> &amp;amp;c., and <i>his desire.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  Also, and ↓ <br>\
      اشجاهُ, (assumed tropical:)  <i>It caused him to be mirthful,</i> (Ks, K, TA,) and <i>excited him.</i> (Ks, TA.) Thus each of these verbs has two contr. significations. (K.) But MF observes that طَرَّبَهُ, the explanation here given in the K, is said by the author of the K [in art. طرب] to denote a lightness arising from joy or grief. (TA.) [Generally, however, it means as rendered above.]    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>اشجاهُ</b>               1     <br>\

                  , inf. n. اـِشْجَا=ءٌ, <i>It choked him;</i> or <i>caused his throat,</i> or <i>fauces, to be obstructed;</i> syn. اَغَصَّهُ; (S, TA;) said of a bone lying across in the throat, or fauces. (TA.) [This is clearly shown to be the meaning in the S, as well as in the TA, intended by اَغَصَّهُ; with which it is also syn. in another sense; for] ―         -b2-  It signifies [also] (assumed tropical:)  <i>It,</i> or <i>he, caused him to fall into grief, mourning, lamentation, sorrow, sadness,</i> or <i>unhappiness.</i> (K.) See also 1, in two places. ―         -b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  <i>He subdued, overpowered,</i> or <i>overcame, him,</i> (K, TA,) <i>so that he grieved,</i> or <i>was sorrowful.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  <i>He angered him.</i> (Ks, TA.) ―         -b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  <i>He made him to go away.</i> (Az, TA.) And اَشْجَيْتُهُ عَنِّى (assumed tropical:)  <i>I gave him</i> (i. e. a creditor or petitioner) <i>what contented him, so that he went away.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  , (As, T, K, * TA,) said of a woman of the desert with reference to a young man who had been dallying, and holding amorous converse, with her, (As, T, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  <i>She resisted him,</i> and <i>expressed grief,</i> or <i>unhappiness, to him,</i> or <i>on account of him,</i> [i. e. <i>on account of his advances,</i>] <i>saying, Alas, my grief,</i> or <i>my unhappiness!</i> (As, T, K, * TA.) And said of a woman with reference to her husband, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>She expressed grief,</i> &amp;amp;c., as above. (A, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>شَجًا</b>               1     <br>\
                     شَجًا<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>A bone,</i> or <i>some other thing</i> (S, K) <i>of the like sort,</i> (K,) <i>sticking fast,</i> (S,) or <i>lying across,</i> or <i>forming an obstruction,</i> (K,) <i>in the throat,</i> or <i>fauces,</i> (S, K,) of a human being, and of a beast; (TA;) <i>a thing in the throat,</i> or <i>fauces, that</i> [<i>chokes one,</i> or] <i>prevents from swallowing:</i> (Har p. 69:) an inf. n. used as a subst. [properly thus termed]. (Har p. 33.) ―         -b2-  See also the next paragraph.    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>شَجْوٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     شَجْوٌ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                   (assumed tropical:)  <i>Anxiety,</i> or <i>disquietude of mind;</i> and <i>grief, mourning, lamentation, sorrow, sadness,</i> or <i>unhappiness;</i> (S;) [and] so ↓ <br>\
      شَجًا: thus termed because a man is choked thereby. (Har p. 33.) ―         -b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  <i>A want; an object of want.</i> (Az, K, TA.) One says, بَكَى فُلَانٌ شَجْوَهُ [app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Such a one wept for his object of want</i>]: and دَعَتِ الحَمَامَةُ شَجْوَهَا [app. (assumed tropical:)  <i>The pigeon called for its object of want</i>].

<b>شَجٍ</b>               1     <br>\
                     شَجٍ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                   (assumed tropical:)  <i>Grieving, mourning,</i> or <i>lamenting;</i> or <i>sorrowing, sad,</i> or <i>unhappy;</i> applied to a man; (S, Msb;) and شَجِيَةٌ, of the measure فَعِلَةٌ, applied to a woman: one says, وَيْلٌ لِلشَّجِى مِنَ <br>\
                  الخَلِىِّ [mentioned and expl. voce خَالٍ, in art. خلو, where each of these epithets is written with teshdeed to the ى; and likewise in another saying there mentioned]: (S:) or, in this saying, (TA,) it signifies <i>occupied</i> [<i>by anxiety</i> or <i>grief</i>]; (K, TA; [in the CK, الشَّجا is erroneously put for الشَّجِى;]) and خَلِىّ means “ free [therefrom]: ” so says AZ: and in this instance الشَّجِى may mean <i>occupied by a bone choking,</i> or <i>obstructing, his throat,</i> or <i>fauces,</i> or <i>by anxiety, and not having found a way of escape therefrom;</i> or <i>by his opponent,</i> or <i>adversary, whom he has been unable to withstand:</i> (TA:) and sometimes one says ↓ <br>\
      شَجِىٌّ, like as one says حَزِنٌ and حَزِينٌ; though this is rare; (Msb;) it is mentioned in the &#39;Eyn; but شَجٍ is more known; and is said by Az to be the chaste form: (TA:) Mbr says, the ى of الخلى is with teshdeed, and the ى of الشَّجِى is without teshdeed, (S,) and sometimes this ى is with teshdeed in poetry; (S, K;) but if you make it to be from شَجَاهُ, it is ↓ <br>\
      شَجِىٌّ only, syn. with مَشْجُوٌّ. [i. e. <i>grieved,</i> &amp;amp;c.]; (S;) and so it is said to be by Az and Z: and Az adds, the second way of accounting for it is, that they often lengthen فَعِلٌ with a ى, saying, فُلَانٌ قَمِنٌ <br>\
                  لِكَذَا and قَمِينٌ, and سَمِجٌ and سَمِيجٌ, and كَرٍ and كَرِىٌّ: and the third way is, that they assimilated one word in measure to another, as in الغَدَايَا <br>\
                  وَالعَشَايَا, the [proper] pl. of غَدَاةٌ being only غَدَوَاتٌ. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  , (S, K,) of the measure فَعَوْعَلٌ [and therefore with tenween], (Mz 40th نوع, and MF and TA,) like خَجَوْجًى &amp;amp;c., (S, * and Mz ibid.,) and ↓ <br>\
      شَجَوْجَا=ءٌ, (K,) applied to a man, (S,) <i>Long in the legs:</i> (S, K:) or <i>very tall:</i> or <i>very tall, with bigness</i> (ضِخَم, in the CK ضَخْم,) <i>of the bones:</i> or <i>long in the back, short in the leg;</i> (K;) thus in the M; but Az says the reverse, i. e. <i>long in the legs, short in the back.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  Also, (K,) or the former, (TA,) A <i>bulky</i> horse. (K.) ―         -b3-  And The عَقْعَق [or <i>magpie</i>]; (K;) [and] so شَجَجَى; (K and TA in art. شج;) fem. with ة [i. e. شَجَوْجَاةٌ].
