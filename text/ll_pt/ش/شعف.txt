                  , (K,) inf. n. شَعَفٌ, though it is implied in the K, by its being said that the verb is like مَنَعَ, that it is شَعْفٌ, (TA,) <i>He smeared, anointed,</i> or <i>overspread,</i> a camel [suffering from the mange, or scab], with tar, (S, O, K, and Bd in xii. 30,) <i>and burned</i> him <i>by so doing.</i> (Bd ibid.)

(TA.) ―         -b2-  Hence, [as indicated above,] قَدْ شَعَفَهَا حُبًّا [<i>He has overspread and burned her</i> heart <i>with love</i>]; as some read in the Kur xii. 30; others reading شَغَفَهَا: (Bd:) [or <i>he has burned her heart with love;</i> for] شَعَفَهُ الحُبُّ means <i>love burned his heart:</i> (S:) there are two readings of the words of the Kur above; (O, K;) [as well as two other readings mentioned in art. شغف;] قَدْ شَعَفَهَا حُبًّا, (S, O, K,) one, a reading of El-Hasan (S, O) and others; meaning [as above: or], accord. to AZ, <i>he has diseased her heart with love,</i> (S, * O,) <i>and</i> <br>\
                  <i>melted it:</i> (O:) or, accord. to El-Hasan, <i>he has penetrated into her with love:</i> (S:) the other reading is قَدْ شَعِفَهَا حُبًّا, (O, K,) meaning <i>he has become attached to her with love,</i> and <i>loved her excessively:</i> (O:) [but it is also said that] شَعَفَنِى <br>\
                  حُبُّهُ means <i>The love of him overspread my heart from above;</i> (O, K;) from شَعَفَةٌ signifying the “ head ” of the heart, “ at the place of suspension of [or from] the نِيَاط; ” (O, * K;) and in like manner, شُعِفْتُ بِهِ and بِحُبِّهِ, (O, and so in the CK,) or شَعِفْتُ: (so in other copies of the K, in which, and in the CK, the verb in this case is said to be like فَرِحَ: [but this I regard as a mistake:]) and شَعَفَ القَلْبَ <br>\
                  <i>He,</i> or <i>it, struck,</i> or <i>smote, the</i> <br>\
                  شَعَفَة, or <i>uppermost part, of the heart:</i> (Ham p. 545:) Az, however, says, I know not any one that has assigned to the heart a شَعَفَة, except Lth; and vehement love takes possession of the core (سَوَاد) of the heart; not of its extremity: [but] accord. to Fr, شُعِفَ بِفُلَانٍ, like عُنِىَ, means <i>The love of such a one rose to the highest places of his heart:</i> others say that الشعف [app. الشَّعَفُ] signifies <i>the being frightened,</i> and <i>disquieted,</i> like the beast when it is frightened; and that the Arabs transferred its attribution from beasts to human beings: (TA:) Abu-l-&#39;Alà says that الشَّعَفُ signifies a thing&#39;s <i>falling into the heart:</i> (IB, TA:) one says also, شَعَفَهُ المَرَضُ <br>\
                  <i>Disease melted him:</i> (TA:) and accord. to AZ, شُعِفَ بِكَذَا means <i>He became diseased by such a thing.</i> (S.)    </entryFree> <br>\
