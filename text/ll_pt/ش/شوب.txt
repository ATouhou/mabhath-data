                  عَسَلٌ [<i>As though her saliva were wine with which honey mingled</i>]. (A.) ―         -b2-  [It is sometimes used in a good sense, but more frequently in a bad sense; and often means <i>He adulterated, vitiated,</i> or <i>sophisticated, it.</i>] It is said in a trad., يَشْهَدُ <br>\
                  بَيْعَكُمُ الحَلِفُ وَاللَّغْوُ فَشُوبُوهُ بِالصَّدَقَةِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Swearing, and unprofitable speech, attend your selling; therefore mix ye it with alms</i>]. (TA.) And it is said in a prov., هُوَ يَشُوبُ وَيَرُوبُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He mixes,</i> or <i>confounds,</i> or <i>makes a confusion</i> or <i>disorder, in speech</i> and <i>in actions:</i> (S, TA:) or <i>he says right one time and wrong another time:</i> (As, TA:) or <i>he defends without energy:</i> (TA:) or <i>he is sometimes incited to motion,</i> or <i>action, and defends himself, but without energy, and sometimes he is motionless, and does not become excited to motion,</i> or <i>action;</i> and it is not from [the words شَوْبٌ and رَوْبٌ applied to] milk: so says Aboo-Sa&#39;eed [i. e. As]: and he says also that شَابَ عَنْهُ وَرَابَ means <i>he defended him at one time, and was sluggish,</i> or <i>indolent, at another time:</i> and that عنه ↓ <br>\
      شوّب, inf. n. تَشْوِيبٌ, means <i>he defended him without energy:</i> and thus this latter is expl. in the K, as is likewise شاب عنه: also that the Arabs say, لَقِيتُ فُلَانًا اليَوْمَ يَشُوبُ عَنْ اَصْحَابِهِ, meaning <i>I found such a one to-day defending his companions in some measure.</i> (TA.) [See also art. روب.] ―         -b3-  شاب also signifies <i>He acted treacherously, perfidiously,</i> or <i>unfaithfully:</i> (Fr, TA:) <i>he lied: he deceived in selling</i> or <i>buying:</i> and <i>he acted dishonestly, insincerely,</i> or <i>with dissimulation.</i> (IAar, TA.) ―         -b4-  [See also Har p. 448; where it is implied that it signifies also <i>He spoke truth,</i> or <i>was veracious.</i>]    </entryFree> <br>\

                   inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (S, A, &amp;amp;c.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] لَا شَوْبَ وَلَا رَوْبَ, occurring in a trad., means <i>There is,</i> or <i>shall be, no dishonesty, insincerity,</i> or <i>dissimulation, nor mixing, in the selling,</i> or <i>buying:</i> so says IAar: or <i>I am irresponsible with respect to this commodity:</i> or, as he is related to have said, <i>thou art irresponsible for its being</i> <br>\

      شِيَابَةٌ, (so in one copy of the S,) signify <i>A mixture; an admixture;</i> or <i>a thing mixed with another thing.</i> (S, TA.) Thus شَوْبًا signifies in the Kur xxxvii. 65: (TA:) or, accord. to one reading, the word there is ↓ <br>\
      شُوبًا, meaning <i>a thing with which another thing is mixed.</i> (Bd.) الشَّوْبُ also signifies [particularly] <i>What is mixed</i> [<i>with something else</i>], <i>of water</i> or <i>of milk:</i> (K:) one says, سَقَاهُ الذَّوْبَ بِالشَّوْبِ <br>\
                  <i>He gave him to drink honey with water,</i> or <i>milk, mixed</i> [<i>therewith</i>]: (TA:) or سَقَاهُ الشَّوْبَ بِالذَّوْبِ <br>\
                  <i>He gave him to drink milk</i> [<i>mixed</i>] <i>with honey.</i> (IDrd, TA.) And <i>Mixed honey;</i> as in the saying, مَا عِنْدِى <br>\
                  شَوْبٌ وَلَا رَوْبٌ <br>\
                  <i>I have not mixed honey nor milk such as is termed</i> <br>\
                  رَايِب [q. v.]: (IAar, TA:) or [simply] <i>honey</i> &amp;amp;c.; (A, Msb, TA;) so called because they mix it with beverages; (Msb;) as in the saying, سَقَاهُ الشَّوْبَ بِالرَّوْبِ <br>\
                  <i>He gave him to drink honey with clarified butter,</i> or <i>with milk.</i> (A.) And <i>Broth;</i> as in the saying, مَا عِنْدَهُ شَوْبٌ وَلَا رَوْبٌ <br>\
                  <i>He has not broth nor milk.</i> (S, K: but in the latter, مَا لَهُ.) And شَوْبٌ signifies also <i>A piece of dough.</i> (K.) ―         -b4-  And [the pl.] اَشْوَابٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>A medley,</i> or <i>mixed multitude, of sundry sorts:</i> a less particular term than اَوْبَاشٌ, which signifies a medley, or mixed multitude, of the low, or lower, or lowest, sort: (TA, from a trad.:) accord. to El-Jawáleekee, it is an arabicized word, from the Pers. ا=شُوبٌ.
