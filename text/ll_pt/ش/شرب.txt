                  , (A, K,) inf. n. شُرْبٌ and شَرْبٌ (S, A, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.) and شِرْبٌ, (S, A, K,) agreeably with three different readings of the Kur lvi. 55, (S, TA,) the first of which (with damm) is that generally obtaining, (Fr, TA,) and is the only one admitted by Jaafar Ibn-Mohammad, notwithstanding which the second form (with fet-h) is said by MF to be the most chaste as well as the most agreeable with analogy, (TA,) or the second (with fet-h) is an inf. n., and the first is a simple subst., (AO, S, Msb, K,) and so is the third, (AO, S, K,) and مَشْرَبٌ, (S, K,) which is  also a n. of place [and of time], (S,) and تَشْرَابٌ, (S K, TA,) a form used when muchness of the act is meant, (TA,) and تِشْرَابٌ, which is anomalous, (TA voce بَيَّنَ, q. v.,) <i>He drank,</i> (KL, PS, TK,) or <i>he swallowed,</i> syn. جَرِعَ, (A, K, [but the former meaning is evidently intended by this explanation, and such I shall assume to be the case in giving the explanations of the derivatives in the A and K. &amp;amp;c.,]) water, &amp;amp;c., (S,) or a liquid, properly <i>by sucking in,</i> or <i>sipping;</i> and <i>otherwise</i> tropically; (Msb;) [generally, <i>gulping</i> it; for] you say, شَرِبَ المَا=ءَ فِى كَرَّةٍ [<i>He drank the water at once,</i> or <i>at a single draught</i>]; and فِى ↓ <br>\

                  مُهْلَةٍ [<i>He drank it leisurely,</i> or <i>gently,</i> or <i>slowly</i>]: (Mgh:) شُرْبٌ signifies the <i>conveying to one&#39;s inside, by means of his mouth, that in the case of which chewing is not practicable:</i> (KT:) [but] Es-Sarakustee says, one does not say of a bird شَرِبَ المَا=ءَ, but حَسَاهُ.

                  </quote> [which is evidently best rendered <i>They drank of the water of the sea, then rose aloft,</i> agreeably with what has been stated respecting بِ in the sense of مِنْ in p. 143, it is said that] the ب is redundant, or, as رَوِينَ is rendered trans. by means of بِ, [though I do not think that this is the case unless بِ be used as meaning “ by means of, ” and I do not remember to have met with an instance of it,] شَرِبْنَ is thus rendered trans. (TA.) [See a similar ex. in the 28th verse of the Mo&#39;allakah of &#39;Antarah, EM p. 232. One says also, شَرِبَ فِى اـِنَا=ءٍ, meaning <i>He drank out of a vessel;</i> agreeably with an explanation of مِشْرَبَةٌ, in the S and K, as meaning اـِنَا=ءٌ يُشْرَبُ فِيهِ.] And one says, اـِنِّى لَاَمْكُثُ اليَوْمَيْنِ مَا اَشْرَبُهُمَا مَا=ءً, meaning مَا اَشْرَبُ فِيهِمَا مَا=ءً [i. e. <i>Verily I tarry the two days not drinking in them water</i>].

                  الدُّخَانَ, meaning <i>He inhaled,</i> properly <i>imbibed, smoke</i> of tobacco; or <i>he smoked tobacco,</i> or <i>the tobacco.</i>] ―         -b4-  One says of seed-produce, or corn, when its culms have come forth, قَدْ شَرِبَ الزَّرْعُ <br>\
                  فِى القَصَبِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>The seed-produce,</i> or <i>corn, has imbibed into the culms</i>]: (O, TA:) and when the sap (المَا=ء) has come into it, شَرِبَ قَصَبُ الزَّرْعِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>The culms of the seed-produce,</i> or <i>corn, have imbibed</i>]. (TA.) And one says, شَرِبَ السُّنْبُلُ <br>\
                  الدَّقِيقَ (tropical:)  [<i>The ears of corn imbibed the farina;</i> or] <i>became pervaded by the farina;</i> (En-Nadr, A, O;) or <i>had in them the alimentary substance;</i> as though the farina were water which they drank. (TA.) And وَقَدْ شَرِبَ الزَّرْعُ الدَّقِيقَ, occurring in the story of Ohod, (O, TA,) as some relate it, or ↓ <br>\
      شُرِّبَ as others relate it, means (tropical:)  [<i>And the seed-produce,</i> or <i>corn, had imbibed,</i> or <i>had been made to imbibe, the farina,</i> or] <i>had become hardened in its grain, and near to maturity.</i> (TA.) [And ↓ <br>\
      اُشْرِبَ means the same: for one says,] اُشْرِبَ الزَّرْعُ (tropical:)  [<i>The seed-produce,</i> or <i>corn, was made to imbibe</i> the farina; or] <i>became pervaded by the farina:</i> and in like manner, اُشْرِبَ الزَّرْعُ الدَّقِيقَ, i. e. (tropical:)  [<i>The seed-produce,</i> or <i>corn, was made to imbibe the farina,</i> or] <i>its alimentary substance.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  One also says, اَكَلَ غَنَمِى وَشَرِبَهَا (tropical:)  [<i>He ate</i> the flesh of <i>my sheep,</i> or <i>goats, and drank</i> the milk of <i>them</i>]. (TA in art. اكل.) And [in like manner] اَكَلَ فُلَانٌ مَالِى <br>\
                  وَشَرِبَهُ (tropical:)  [<i>Such a one fed upon, devoured,</i> or <i>consumed, my property</i>]. (A.) And اَكَلَ عَلَيْهِ الدَّهْرُ وَشَرِبَ (tropical:)  [<i>Time wasted him,</i> or <i>wore him away;</i> as though it fed upon him]. (A.) ―         -b6-  And مَا لَمْ ↓ <br>\

                  اَشْرَبْ [lit. <i>Thou hast made me to drink what I have not drunk,</i>] meaning (tropical:)  <i>thou hast charged against me,</i> or <i>accused me of doing, what I have not done;</i> (S, A, K;) like اَكَّلْتَنِى مَا لَمْ ا=كُلْ. (S in art. اكل.) ―         -b7-  شَرِبَ also signifies <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, satisfied with drinking:</i> (TA:) and in like manner شَرِبَت is said of camels. (A &#39;Obeyd, S, TA.) And <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, thirsty;</i> (K, TA;) thus having two contr. significations; (TA;) as also ↓ <br>\

      اَشْرَبَ, <i>His camels were,</i> or <i>became, satisfied with drinking:</i> and, i. e. both these verbs, <i>his camels were,</i> or <i>became, thirsty:</i> (K, TA:) or the former verb signifies, or signifies also, (accord. to different copies of the K,) <i>his camel was,</i> or <i>became, weak.</i> (K, TA.)       -A2-  شَرِبَ بِهِ, and بِهِ ↓ <br>\

                  , inf. n. كَتْبٌ; and in the K, to be like نَصَرَ.] One says, شَرَبَ مَا اُلْقِىَ اـِلَيْهِ, i. e. <i>He understood</i> [<i>what was told to him</i>]. (TA.) And one says to a stupid person, اُحْلُبْ ثُمَّ اْشْرُبْ <br>\

                  الثَّوْبُ حُمْرَةً (tropical:)  <i>The garment,</i> or <i>piece of cloth, was imbued,</i> or <i>saturated, with redness.</i> (A.)

(TA.) Whence, in the Kur [ii. 87], وَاُشْرِبُوا فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ اْلْعِجْلَ, for حُبَّ العِجْلِ, (S, TA,) i. e.

(A.) [Or] اشربهُ means (tropical:)  <i>He put the rope,</i> or <i>cord, upon his neck;</i> namely, a man&#39;s, (K, TA,) and a camel&#39;s, and a horse&#39;s or the like: (TA:) and اشرب الخَيْلَ <br>\
                  <i>he put the ropes,</i> or <i>cords, upon the necks of the horses.</i> (K,) And اشرب اـِبِلَهُ (tropical:)  <i>He tied his camels, every one to</i> <br>\
                  <i>another.</i> (K, TA.)       -A2-  اشرب as an intrans. verb: see 1, last quarter, in two places. ―         -b2-  Also <i>He</i> (a man, TA) <i>attained to the time for the drinking of his camels.</i> (K, * TA.)       -A3-  اشرب بِهِ: see 1, near the end of the paragraph.    </entryFree> <br>\

                  يشرب الصِّبْغَ [app. ↓ <br>\
      يُشْرَبُ, (like as one says يُشْرَبُ حُمْرَةً, as shown in the next preceding paragraph,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>The garment,</i> or <i>piece of cloth, is made to imbibe,</i> or <i>absorb, the dye</i>]. (TA.) [It is said that] the verb is not used intransitively in the [proper] language of the Arabs. (Mgh.) [But] one says, تشرّب الصِّبْغُ فِى الثَّوْبِ, meaning (tropical:)  <i>The dye pervaded the garment,</i> or <i>piece of cloth:</i> (K, * TA:) and الصِّبْغُ يَتَشَرَّبُ الثَّوْبَ (tropical:)  [<i>The dye pervades the garment,</i> or <i>piece of cloth</i>].

(ISk, TA.) It is said in a prov., ا=خِرُهَا اَقَلُّهَا شِرْبًا [<i>The last of them is the one of them that has the least share of water</i>]: originating from the watering of camels; because the last of them sometimes comes to the water when the watering-trough has been exhausted. (S. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i. 61.]) ―         -b5-  As a law-term, it means The <i>use of water</i> [or the <i>right to use it</i>] <i>for the watering of sown-fields and of beasts.</i> (Mgh.) ―         -b6-  Also <i>A wateringplace;</i> syn. مَوْرِدٌ: (AZ, K:) pl. as above.
