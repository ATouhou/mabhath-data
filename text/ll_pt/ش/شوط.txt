      شَوَّطَ, but as this, in the manner in which it is there mentioned, is a needless repetition, being implied, if correct, it is doubtless a mistranscription,] <i>He continued to drive,</i> or <i>urge on, the horse, until he was tired,</i> or <i>fatigued.</i> (K, * TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>He performed seven circuits round the House</i> [of God, i. e. the Kaabeh]: (S, TA:) from the [Black] Stone to the [Black] Stone [again] is one شَوْط: (S, Msb, TA:) but some of the lawyers disapprove of this application of the term اشواط.

                  مَيْدَان, and <i>the like;</i> which is [said by some to be] the primary signification; [but the primary signification is said by others to be the first given above; (see Har p. 574;)] and so ↓ <br>\
      تَشْوِيطَةٌ. (TA.) ―         -b5-  Also (assumed tropical:)  <i>A scope; an object to be reached,</i> or <i>accomplished;</i> syn. غَايَةٌ: whence the saying, الشَّوْطُ <br>\
                  بَطِينٌ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The scope is remote:</i> (Har p. 574:) a prov., relating to the long extent of hope.

                  <i>i. q.</i> <br>\

                  بَاطِلٍ: see سَوْطُ بَاطِلٍ, in art. سوط: accord. to IDrd, it is not of established authority. (O.)    </entryFree> <br>\
