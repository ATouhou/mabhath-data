      شَبَابٌ is used in the sense of تَشْبِيبٌ; thus a قَصِيدَة is said to be حَسَنَةٌ الشَّبَابِ (tropical:)  [<i>Beautiful in the mention of women</i> &amp;amp;c.]; and Jereer is said to have been اَرَقُّ النَّاسِ شَبَابًا (tropical:)  [<i>The most elegant of men in the mention of women</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (A, TA.) ―         -b3-  Hence, i. e. from تَشْبِيبٌ القَصِيدَةِ, may be derived التَّشْبِيبُ as a conventional term in the science of the division of inheritances; meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>The mention of daughters according to the different degrees</i> [<i>of descent</i>]: (Mgh:) it is as when one says, “ he died, and left three daughters of a son, subordinate one to another, and three daughters of a son&#39;s son, in like manner, and three daughters of a son&#39;s son&#39;s son, in like manner, and the sons died and the daughters remained. ” (O.) ―         -b4-  تَشْبِيبُ الكُتُبِ signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>The commencing of books,</i> or <i>writings:</i> and hence شَبَّبَ يُجَاوِبُهُ, occurring in a trad., meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>He commenced answering him:</i> not from the تَشْبِيب of women in poetry.
