                   The <i>new moon, when it appears:</i> (IF, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K:) so called because of its conspicuousness. (Mgh, Msb.) This is the original signification. (Mgh.) [See the last sentence of this paragraph.] You say, رَاَيْتُ الشَّهْرَ, meaning <i>I saw the new moon of the month.</i> (Mgh.) Hence it is said in a trad., صُومُوا الشَّهْرَ, meaning <i>Fast ye the first day of the lunar month.</i> (Lh, TA.) And hence the trad., اـِنَّمَا الشَّهْرُ تِسْعٌ وَعِشْرُونَ, meaning The utility of watching for <i>the new moon is on the nine and twentieth</i> night. (L, TA.) [Or the meaning is, that the lunar month is a period of nine and twenty nights.] ―         -b2-  Also The <i>moon:</i> or the <i>moon when conspicuous, and near to being full.</i> (K.) ―         -b3-  And [A <i>lunar month;</i>] <i>a certain well-known number of days:</i> so called because made manifest by the moon: (ISd, K:) an arabicized word; or, as some say, Arabic; (Msb;) and so called because of its being manifest: (Msb, TA:) pl. [of pauc.] اَشْهُرٌ (Msb, K) and [of mult.] شُهُورٌ. (S, Msb, K.) The following are the modern names of the months: 1. المُحَرَّمُ [to which the epithet الحَرَامُ is often added]: 2. صَفَرٌ [to which the epithet الخَيْرُ is often added]: 3. رَبِيعٌ الاَوَّلُ: 4. رَبِيعٌ الا=خِرُ [or الثَّانِى]: 5. جُمَادَى الاُولَى: 6. جُمَادَى الا=خِرَةُ [or الثَّانِيَةُ]: 7. رَجَبٌ [to which is often added the epithet الاَصَمُّ, and that of الفَرْدُ]: 8. شَعْبَانُ [to which we often find the epithet المُعَظَّمُ added, and sometimes that of الشَّرِيفُ]: 9. رَمَضَانُ [to which the epithet المُبَارَكُ is appropriated]: 10. شَوَّالٌ [to which the epithet المُكَرَّمُ is frequently added]: 11. ذُو القَعْدَةِ: and 12. ذُو الحِجَّةِ: [see the second of the two tables in p. 1254:] and the following are the names by which they were called by the tribe of &#39;Ád, agreeably with the foregoing numeration: 1. مُوْتَمِرٌ: 2. نَاجِرٌ: 3. خَوَّانٌ: 4. بُصَّانٌ [q. v.]: 5. رُبَّى: 6. حَنِينٌ: 7. الاَصَمُّ: 8. عَاذِلٌ: 9. نَاتِقٌ: 10. وَعْلٌ: 11. وَرْنَةُ: and 12. بُرَكٌ [or بُرَكُ?]. (Ibn-El-Kelbee, in TA, voce مُوْتَمِرٌ. [But authors differ respecting some of these names, as will be seen in other articles.]) اَشْهُرٌ مَعْلُومَاتٌ, said, in the Kur [ii. 193], to be the period of the pilgrimage, for by الحَجُّ, which immediately precedes, is meant وَقْتُ الحَجِّ, (Mgh, Msb,) or زَمَانُ الحَجِّ, (Msb,) applies to <i>Showwál and Dhul-Kaadeh and ten days of Dhu-l-Hijjeh,</i> (Mgh, Msb,) accord. to Aboo-Haneefeh (Mgh) and most of the learned, part of Dhu-l-Hijjeh being called a month tropically, as is often done by the Arabs in similar cases, relating to time; for ex. when they say, مَا رَاَيْتُهُ مُذْ يَوْمَانِ, the period of separation having been a day and a part of a day: (Msb:) or [<i>and</i>] <i>nine days of Dhu-l-Hijjeh with the night preceding the day of the sacrifice,</i> accord. to Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee: (Mgh:) or [<i>and</i>] <i>all Dhu-l-Hijjeh,</i> accord. to Málik: (Mgh, Msb:) [in these two explanations the two months next preceding being meant to be included:] or <i>Showwál and Dhu-l- Kaadeh and Dhu-l-Hijjeh and Moharram,</i> accord. to Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Shaabee.

(O, TA.) ―         -b5-  [And accord. to the K, it signifies also The <i>like of a nail-paring:</i> but this is app. a mistake, perhaps originating from a mutilated transcript of what here follows:] a poet says, describing camels, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
