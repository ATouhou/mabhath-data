(TA.) The reading بِشِهَابِ قَبَسٍ, instead of بِشِهَابٍ قَبَسٍ, in the Kur [xxvii. 7], is an instance of a word prefixed to another identical therewith. (Fr. L.) ―         -b2-  Hence, [<i>A shooting,</i> or <i>falling, star;</i>] <i>a star,</i> or the <i>like of a star, that darts down</i> [or <i>is hurled</i>] <i>by night;</i> and particularly <i>after a devil;</i> as occurring in the Kur [xv. 18 and] xxxvii. 10; and in a trad.; respecting the attempt of a devil to hear, by stealth, words uttered in heaven. (TA.) ―         -b3-  [Hence also,] الشُّهُبُ signifies <i>The shining,</i> or <i>brightly-shining, stars:</i> (K:) or <i>the seven stars</i> [or <i>planets;</i> meaning, not the Pleiades (which are called النَّجْمُ), but <i>the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn:</i> the first three of which are said by Freytag to be called صِغَارُ الشُّهُبِ]. (TA.) ―         -b4-  For another meaning assigned in the K to الشُّهُبُ, see الشُّهْبُ, voce اَشْهَبُ. ―         -b5-  شِهَابٌ also signifies (tropical:)  <i>One who is penetrating, sharp,</i> or <i>energetic,</i> in an affair; (K, TA;) as being likened to the [shooting] star. (TA.) One says, اـِنَّ فُلَانًا لَشِهَابُ <br>\
                  حَرْبٍ (tropical:)  <i>Verily such a man is one who is penetrating, sharp,</i> or <i>energetic, in war.</i> (S, A. *) And هٰوُلَا=ءِ شُهْبَانُ الجَيْشِ (tropical:)  [<i>These are the braves,</i> or <i>heroes, of the army</i>]. (A.) ―         -b6-  Also the name of <i>A certain devil:</i> occurring in a trad.: hence the Prophet changed the name of a certain man [originally] thus named. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

      شَاهِبٌ, (K,) occurring in the poetry of Hudheyl: (TA:) fem. of the former شَهْبَا=ءُ: (S, Msb, K: *) and pl. شُهْبٌ: (O:) the former epithet is applied to a horse, (S,) [contr. to an assertion of IAar, (see 4,)] and to a he-mule, (Msb,) and شَهْبَا=ءُ to a she-mule. (Mgh, Msb.) [Golius, on the authority of Meyd, explains اَشْهَبُ اَدْهَمُ, applied to a horse, as meaning <i>Subniger, spadiceus:</i> and اَشْهَبُ اَخْضَرُ as meaning <i>lucide leviterve viridis:</i> the correct meaning of the former seems to be <i>of a blackish,</i> or <i>brownish, gray:</i> and that of the latter, <i>of a dark dustcoloured gray:</i> see اَدْهَمُ and اَخْضَرُ.] الشَّهْبَا=ءُ was the name of a mare belonging to El-Kattál ElBejelee. (O, K; in the CK El-Bejlee.) Applied to a she-goat, شَهْبَا=ءُ signifies <i>Of a white colour intermixed with black:</i> thus applied, it is like مَلْحَا=ءُ applied to a ewe. (K.) Applied to a غُرَّة [or blaze on a horse&#39;s forehead], it means <i>In which are hairs differing from the whiteness</i> [<i>of the blaze</i>]. (S.) And الاَشَاهِبُ is [a pl. formed from الاَشْهَبُ as though this were a subst.] applied to the Benu-l-Mundhir, (K,) or one of the troops of En-Noamán Ibn-El-Mundhir, consisting of the sons of his paternal uncle and his maternal uncles, and their brethren; (TA;) so called because of their comeliness, (K,) or because of the whiteness of their faces. (TA.) ―         -b2-  Applied to ambergris, (K, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  <i>Of an excellent colour,</i> i. e., (TA,) <i>inclining to whiteness.</i> (K, TA.) And applied to an iron head or blade of an arrow or of a spear &amp;amp;c., (tropical:)  <i>That has been filed so that its blackness has gone:</i> (S, A, TA:) or <i>that has been filed lightly, so that all its blackness has not gone.</i> (AHn, TA.) [Hence,] كَتِيبَةٌ شَهْبَا=ءُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>A great troop having numerous weapons;</i> (K;) so called because of the iron; (S;) or because of the whiteness of the weapons and iron, intermixed with blackness: or <i>a troop of which the iron</i> [<i>of the weapons and armour</i>] <i>is white and bright:</i> (TA:) or, as also ↓ <br>\
      كَتِيبَةٌ شَهَّابَةٌ, <i>a troop upon which is</i> [<i>seen</i>] <i>the whiteness of the iron</i> [<i>weapons &amp;amp;c.</i>]. (T, TA. [See also كَتِيبَةٌ مَلْحَا=ءُ, voce اَمْلَحُ.]) And جَيْشٌ <br>\
                  اَشْهَبُ <br>\
                  <i>A strong army</i> [app. because of its numerous weapons]. (TA.) ―         -b3-  اَرْضٌ شَهْبَا=ءُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>A land in which is no verdure, by reason of the paucity of rain.</i> (TA.) And [hence,] سَنَةٌ شَهْبَا=ءُ (tropical:)  <i>A year of drought,</i> or <i>sterility, white in consequence thereof,</i> (TA,) <i>in which is no verdure,</i> or <i>in which is no rain:</i> (K, TA:) next in degree is the بَيْضَا=ء; then, the حَمْرَا=ء, which is more severe than the بَيْضَا=ء; (TA;) and then, the سَوْدَا=ء: (TA in art. حمر:) or <i>a year that is white by reason of the abundance of snow and the want of herbage:</i> (IB, TA:) or <i>a year of drought,</i> or <i>sterility;</i> because the seedproduce dries up therein, and becomes yellow: and عَامٌ اَشْهَبُ signifies the same. (Har p. 150.) And اَشْهَبَانِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Two white years</i> (عَامَانِ اَبْيَضَانِ) <i>between which is no verdure</i> (K, TA) <i>of herbage.</i> (TA.) And يَوْمٌ اَشْهَبُ (tropical:)  <i>A cold day:</i> (A, K:) or <i>a day of cold wind;</i> thought to be so called on account of the snow and hoar frost and hail therein: (L, TA:) or <i>a day of hoar-frost:</i> (Az, TA:) <i>a day of cold wind and hoar frost;</i> and [in like manner] the night (اللَّيْلَةُ) is termed شَهْبَا=ءُ.

                  </quote> [<i>May my she-camel be a ransom for the sons of Dhuhl Ibn-Sheybán when there is a day of difficulties,</i> or <i>distresses,</i> . . .] the meaning may be اشهب [or <i>whitish</i>] <i>by reason of the whiteness of the weapons,</i> or <i>by reason of the dust.</i> (TA.) And الشُّهْبُ [pl. of اَشْهَبُ], (O,) or ↓ <br>\
      الشُّهُبُ [pl. of شِهَابٌ], (K,) [but the former, I think, is evidently the right,] (assumed tropical:)  <i>The white nights;</i> (اللَّيَالِى البِيضُ;) [i. e. <i>the thirteenth and fourteenth and fifteenth nights of the lunar month;</i> so called because lighted by the moon throughout, (see art. بيض;)] (O;) <i>three nights of the month;</i> (K, TA;) because of the alteration of their colour. (TA.) ―         -b4-  اَشْهَبُ [or اَمْرٌ اَشْهَبُ] also signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>A hard,</i> or <i>difficult, affair</i> or <i>case,</i> (K, TA,) <i>such as is disliked,</i> or <i>hated.</i> (TA.) And اَشْهَبُ بَازِلٌ (assumed tropical:)  <i>A hard,</i> or <i>difficult, affair</i> or <i>case, that is beyond one&#39;s power</i> [<i>of accomplishment</i> or <i>endurance</i>]: termed بازل because the camel thus termed is one that has attained its utmost strength. (O, TA. [See also art. بزل.]) ―         -b5-  And الاَشْهَبُ signifies <i>The lion.</i> (O, K.) [And in the Deewán of Jereer, it is applied to <i>The swine.</i> (Freytag.)]   </entryFree> <br>\
