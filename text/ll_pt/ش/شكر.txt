                  , (TA,) inf. n. شُكْرٌ and شُكْرَانٌ (S, A, * Msb, K) and شُكُورٌ, (S, K) which last, in the Kur lxxvi. 9, may be either an inf. n. or pl. of شُكْرٌ [used as a simple subst.], (S,) <i>He thanked him;</i> or <i>praised, eulogized,</i> or <i>commended, him, for a benefit</i> or <i>benefits:</i> (S:) <i>he was grateful,</i> or <i>thankful, to him;</i> or <i>he acknowledged his beneficence,</i> and <i>spoke of it largely:</i> (S, *  K: [but in the S, the verb in the former sense has شُكْرٌ only for its inf. n., and it is implied that in the latter sense it has for its inf. n. only شُكْرَانٌ, as will be seen below:]) and شَكَرَ لِلّٰهِ, and شَكَرَ اْللّٰهَ, (Lh, Msb, K,) which latter is less common than the former, and even disallowed by As in prose, though allowed by him in verse, (Msb,) and شَكَرَ بِاْللّٰهِ and شَكَرَ نِعْمَةَ اْللّٰهِ, and شَكَرَ بِنِعْمَةِ اْللّٰهِ, (Lh, K,) and شَكَرَ لِلّٰهِ نِعْمَتَهُ, (A,) inf. n. شُكْرٌ and شُكْرَانٌ (Msb) [and شُكُورٌ], <i>He thanked,</i> or <i>praised, God for his beneficence:</i> (A:) <i>he was grateful,</i> or <i>thankful, to God;</i> or <i>acknowledged his beneficence,</i> and <i>spoke of it largely:</i> (K:) <i>he acknowledge the beneficence of God, and acted in the manner incumbent on him in rendering Him obedience and abstaining from disobedience;</i> so that شُكْر is in word and in deed: (Msb:) and لَهُ ↓ <br>\
      تَشَكَّرَ signifies the same as شَكَرَ لَهُ: (S, A, Msb, K:) you say, لَهُ مَا صَنَعَ ↓ <br>\

                  كُفْرَانٌ: (S:) شُكْرٌ [sometimes] differs from حَمْدٌ; (Msb in art. حمد;) for شكر is only on account of favour received; whereas حمد is sometimes because of favour received, (Th, Az, TA in art. حمد, and Msb ubi suprà,) and sometimes form other causes; (Th ubi suprà;) [and thus] the latter is of more common application than the former; (S in art. حمد;) therefore you do not say شَكَرْتُهُ عَلَى <br>\
                  شَجَاعَتِهِ, but you say حَمِدْتُهُ على شجاعته: (Msb ubi suprà:) or شُكْرٌ is more common than حَمْدٌ with respect to its kinds and means, and more particular with respect to the objects to which it relates; and the latter is more common with respect to the objects to which it relates, and more particular with respect to the means; for the former is, with the heart, the <i>being humble,</i> or <i>lowly, and submissive;</i> and with the tongue, the act of <i>praising, eulogizing,</i> or <i>commending;</i> and <i>acknowledging beneficence;</i> and with the members, the act of <i>obeying,</i> and <i>submitting one&#39;s self;</i> and the object to which it relates is the benefactor, exclusively of his essential qualities; therefore one does not say شَكَرْنَا اْللّٰهَ عَلَى حَيَاتِهِ [<i>we thanked God for his existence,</i> or <i>praised Him, &amp;amp;c.</i>]; but He is مَحْمُود on that account, like as He is for his beneficence; and شُكْرٌ is also for beneficence: thus حَمْدٌ relates to every object to which, as an object, شُكْرٌ relates; but the reverse is not the case: and everything whereby is حمد, thereby is شكر; but the reverse is not the case; for the latter is by means of the members, or limbs, and the former is by means of the tongue: شُكْرٌ is of three kinds; with the heart, or mind, which is the <i>forming an</i> [<i>adequate</i>] <i>idea of the benefit;</i> and with the tongue, which is the <i>praising, eulogizing,</i> or <i>commending, the benefactor;</i> and with the members, or limbs, which is the <i>requiting the benefit according to its desert:</i> it rests upon five foundations; humility of him who renders it towards him to whom it is rendered; his love of him; his acknowledgment of his benefit; the eulogizing him for it; and his not making use of the benefit in a manner which he [who has conferred it] dislikes: it is also explained as <i>devotion of the heart to love of the benefactor,</i> and <i>of the members to obey him,</i> and <i>the employment of the tongue in mentioning him and eulogizing him:</i> [and there are several other explanations of it which it is unnecessary to add:] some say that it is formed by transposition from كَشْرٌ, the “ act of uncovering, or exposing to view: ” others, that it is from عَيْنٌ شَكْرَى “ a full fountain, or eye; ” accord. to which etymology it would signify the <i>being full of the praise of the benefactor.</i> (B, TA.) ―         -b2-  شُكْرٌ on the part of God signifies (tropical:)  The <i>requiting and commending</i> [a person]: (K:) or (assumed tropical:)  the <i>forgiving</i> a man: or (tropical:)  the <i>regarding</i> him <i>with content, satisfaction, good will,</i> or <i>favour:</i> and hence, necessarily, (tropical:)  the <i>recompensing,</i> or <i>rewarding,</i> him: the saying شَكَرَ اْللّٰهُ سَعْيَهُ signifies (tropical:)  <i>May God recompense,</i> or <i>reward, his work,</i> or <i>labour.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  شَكِرَتْ, aor.      <br>\
