                   a word of well-known meaning [i. e. <i>A devil;</i> and with the article ال, <i>the devil, Satan</i>]: (S, K:) <i>any that is excessively,</i> or <i>inordinately, proud</i> or <i>corrupt</i> or <i>unbelieving</i> or <i>rebellious,</i> or <i>that is insolent and audacious in pride and in acts of rebellion, of mankind,</i> and <i>of the jinn,</i> or <i>genii,</i> and <i>of beasts;</i> (A&#39;Obeyd, S, Msb, K;) as is shown in relation to the first and second of these by what is said in the Kur vi. 112, and ii. 13 and 96: (TA:) the ن is radical, (S, Msb, TA,) the word being of the measure فَيْعَالٌ, from شَطَنَ, (Msb, TA,) signifying “ he was, or became, distant, or remote, ” (TA,) or signifying “ he was, or became, remote, or far, from the truth, and from the mercy of God; ” (Msb;) as is indicated by the pl. شَيَاطِينُ; [for] the reading of El-Hasan in the Kur xxvi. 210, الشَّيَاطُونَ, is anomalous, [like بَسَاتُونَ for بَسَاتِينُ,] and is said by Th to be a mistake: (TA:) or, as some say, the ن is augmentative, (S, Msb, TA, *) and the ى is radical, so that the word is of the measure فَعْلَان, (Msb,) from شَاطَ, aor. يَشِيطُ, (Msb, TA,) signifying “ it was, or became, null, void, of no account, ” and the like, and “ it burned, ” or “ became burnt, ” (Msb,) or signifying “ he burned with anger: ” but the former opinion is the more common: (TA:) [in the Kur, the word is always perfectly decl.; and so it is said to be by SM, in art. شيط of the TA; unless used as a proper name: but J says,] if you make it to be of the measure فَيْعَال from تَشَيْطَنَ said of a man, [or rather because they say of a man تشيطن,] you make it perfectly decl.; but if you make it to be from شَيَّطَ [“ he burned ” a thing], you make it imperfectly decl., because it is of the measure فَعْلَان. (S.) ―         -b2-  Also The <i>serpent:</i> (S, K:) or <i>a certain species of serpents;</i> (Fr, S, TA;) <i>having a mane, of foul aspect:</i> or, as some say, <i>a slender, light,</i> or <i>active, serpent.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  Respecting the saying in the Kur [xxxvii. 63], طَلْعُهَا كَاَنَّهُ رُوُوسُ الشَّيَاطِينِ [<i>Its fruit is as though it were the heads of the</i> <br>\
                  شياطين], Fr says that there are three ways in which it may be explained: one is, that the طلع is likened to the heads of the شياطين [meaning <i>devils</i>] in respect of foulness, or ugliness, because these are described as foul, or ugly: (S:) or it is likened to the <i>evil in disposition of the jinn,</i> because these are imagined as foul, or ugly: Zj says, in explaining it, that one says of a thing deemed foul, or ugly, كَاَنَّهُ وَجْهُ شَيْطَانٍ [<i>as though it were the face of a devil</i>], and كَاَنَّهُ رَاْسُ <br>\
                  شَيْطَانٍ [<i>as though it were the head of a devil</i>]; for though the شيطان is not seen, he is conceived in the mind as the foulest, or ugliest, of things: (TA:) the second is, that [the meaning is <i>foul,</i> or <i>ugly, serpents;</i> for] the Arabs apply the name شيطان to <i>a sort of serpents, having a mane, foul,</i> or <i>ugly, in the head and face:</i> (S, TA: *) the third is, that <i>a certain foul,</i> or <i>ugly, plat is named</i> <br>\
                  رُوُوسُ الشَّيَاطِينِ; (S, TA;) which is expl. in the K only as meaning <i>a certain plant.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  شَيْطَانُ الفَلَا [lit. <i>The devil of the waterless deserts</i>] means (assumed tropical:)  <i>thirst.</i> (K.) ―         -b5-  شَيْطَانٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  <i>Any blamable faculty,</i> or <i>power,</i> [or <i>propensity,</i>] of a man. (Er-Rághib, TA.) One says, رَكِبَهُ شَيْطَانُهُ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [<i>His anger got the ascendency over him;</i> or] <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, angry.</i> (TA.) And نَزَعَ شَيْطَانَهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He plucked out his pride.</i> (TA.) ―         -b6-  Also, [probably as being likened to a serpent,] (assumed tropical:)  <i>A mark made with a hot iron in the upper part of the haunch of a camel, perpendicularly, upon the thigh, extending to the hock;</i> (K, TA;) from the “ Tedhkireh ” of Aboo-&#39;Alee; (TA;) likewise called ↓ <br>\
