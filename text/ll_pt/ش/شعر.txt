                  <i>A poet:</i> (T, S, Msb, K:) so called because of his intelligence; (S, Msb;) or because he knows what others know not: (T, TA:) accord. to Akh, it is a possessive epithet, like لَابِنٌ and تَامِرٌ: (S:) pl. شُعَرَا=ءُ, (S, Msb, K,) deviating from analogy: (S, Msb:) Sb says that the measure فَاعِلٌ is likened in this case to فَعِيلٌ; and hence this pl.: (TA:) or, accord. to IKh, the pl. is of this form because the sing. is from شَعُرَ, and therefore should by rule be of the measure فَعِيلٌ, like شَرِيفٌ [from شَرُفَ]; but were it so, it might be confounded with شَعِير meaning the grain thus called, therefore they said شَاعِرٌ, and regarded in the pl. the original form of the sing. (Msb.) A wonderful poet is called خِنْذِيذٌ: one next below him, شَاعِرٌ: then, ↓ <br>\
      شَوَيْعِرٌ [the dim.]: (Yoo, K:) then, ↓ <br>\

                  <i>Excellent poetry:</i> (Sb, T, K:) or <i>known poetry:</i> but the former explanation is the more correct. (TA.) One also says, sometimes, كَلِمَةٌ شَاعِرَةٌ, [by كلمة] meaning قَصِيدَةٌ: but generally in a phrase of this kind the two words are cognate, as in وَيْلٌ وَايِلٌ and لَيْلٌ لَايِلٌ.

(S, K.) One says اشْعَثُ اَشْعَرُ, meaning <i>Having his head unshaven and not combed nor anointed.</i> (TA.) And فُلَانٌ اَشْعَرُ الرَّقَبَةِ [lit. <i>Such a one is hairy in the neck</i>] is said of a man though he have not hair upon his neck, as meaning (tropical:)  <i>such a one is strong, like a lion.</i> (A, * TA.) ―         -b2-  [The fem.] شَعْرَا=ءُ also signifies <i>A testicle,</i> or <i>scrotum,</i> (خُصْيَةٌ,) <i>having much hair:</i> (TA:) and the سَوْءَة [or <i>pudendum</i>]: thus used as a subst.

See also شِعْرَةٌ. ―         -b3-  And <i>A furred garment.</i> (Th, K.) ―         -b4-  And as an epithet, (tropical:)  <i>Evil, foul,</i> or <i>abominable:</i> [as being likened to that which is shaggy, and therefore unseemly:] (K, * TA:) in the K, الخَشِنَةُ is erroneously put for الخَبِيثَةُ. (TA.) One says, دَاهِيَةٌ شَعْرَا=ءُ, (S, A, K,) and وَبْرَا=ءُ, (S, A,) and زَبَّا=ءُ, (TA in art. زب,) (tropical:)  <i>An evil, a foul,</i> or <i>an abominable,</i> (TA,) or <i>a severe,</i> or <i>great,</i> (K,) <i>calamity</i> or <i>misfortune:</i> pl. شُعْرٌ.

(So in the CK.) ―         -b9-  And [the fem.] شَعْرَا=ءُ also signifies (tropical:)  Land (اَرْض) <i>containing,</i> or <i>having, trees:</i> or <i>abounding in trees:</i> (A, K:) [and so, app., ↓ <br>\
      شَعْرَانُ; for] there is a mountain in [the province of] El-Mowsil called شَعْرَانُ, said by AA to be thus called because of the abundance of its trees: (S:) or شَعْرَا=ءُ signifies <i>many trees:</i> (A &#39;Obeyd, S:) or <i>i. q.</i> <br>\

      شُعَيْرَا=ءُ: (TA:) <i>a kind of fly that stings the ass, so that he goes round:</i> AHn says that <i>it is of two species, that of the dog</i> and <i>that of the camel: that of the dog is well known, inclines to slenderness and redness, and touches nothing but the dog: that of the camel inclines to yellowness, is larger than that of the dog, has wings, and is downy under the wings: sometimes it is in such numbers that the owners of the camels cannot milk in the day-time nor ride any of them; so that they leave doing this until night: it stings the camel in the soft parts of the udder and around them, and beneath the tail and the belly and the armpits; and they do not protect the animal from it save by tar: it flies over the camels so that one hears it to make a humming,</i> or <i>buzzing, sound.</i> (TA. [See also شُعْرُورٌ, under which its pl. شُعْرٌ is mentioned.]) ―         -b13-  And [hence, perhaps, as this kind of fly is seen in swarms,] (assumed tropical:)  <i>A multitude of men.</i> (K.)    </entryFree> <br>\
