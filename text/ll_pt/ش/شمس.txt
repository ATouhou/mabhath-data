                   [<i>The sun;</i>] <i>the body of the solar light, that runs its course in the firmament:</i> (Lth, * TA:) it is fem.: (S, * Msb, K:) and has neither dual nor pl.: (Msb:) or it has a pl., [though this is not used in a pl. sense,] namely, شُمُوسٌ, (S, K,) as though they called every part of it a شمس, like as they said مَفَارِقُ for مَفْرِقٌ. (S.) When it is made determinate without the article ال, [as] in the name عَبْدُ شَمْسَ, meaning <i>The Servant of the Sun,</i> (Msb, K,) i. e., of this luminous object, (Msb,) the شمس of heaven, because they used to worship it, (K,) it is imperfectly decl., (Aboo- &#39;Alee, Msb, K,) because it is determinate and of the fem. gender, (Aboo-&#39;Alee, K,) or because it is a proper name and of the fem. gender and altered from الشَّمْس: (Msb:) and a poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>Nay verily, by the sun, we will assuredly dye them with blood</i>], making شمس imperfectly decl. because he means the art. ال to be understood: (IAar, TA:) but some say that in the former instance, (Msb, TA,) and in the latter, (TA,) the word in question has a different signification, which will be shown below: (Msb, TA:) and Sb says that none of the Arabs made شمس determinate without the art. ال, except in the proper name mentioned above, in which all of them made it so.

Accord. to Ibn-El-Kelbee, it is this that is meant by the proper name mentioned above; and if so, it is perfectly decl.: (Msb:) and some say that it is this also that is meant in the words of the poet cited above, and that he makes the word imperfectly decl. because he uses it as a proper name of the image (الصُّورَة). (TA.)       -A2-  شَمْسٌ also signifies <i>A kind of necklace</i> or <i>collar:</i> (S, K:) or a <i>pendant,</i> or <i>suspended ornament,</i> (مِعْلَاق,) <i>of the necklace</i> or <i>collar upon the neck:</i> or the <i>collar of a dog:</i> (TA:) or <i>a kind of women&#39;s ornament:</i> of the masc. gender: (Lh, TA:) pl. شُمُوسٌ.
