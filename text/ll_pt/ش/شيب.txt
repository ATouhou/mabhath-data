      مَشِيبٌ: (K, TA:) both signify the same [and are thus used as simple substs. and are also inf. ns.]: (S:) or the former has the latter of the two significations given above; (As, S, Mgh, Msb;) and is <i>little</i> and <i>much</i> [<i>whiteness of the hair</i>]: one says, عَلَاهُ الشَّيْبُ [<i>Whiteness of the hair,</i> or <i>hoariness, came upon him</i>]: (TA:) but ↓ <br>\
      مَشِيبٌ signifies a man&#39;s <i>entering upon the period of whiteness of the hair,</i> or <i>hoariness:</i> (As, S, Msb:) see an ex. of this latter in the first paragraph. In the phrase in the Kur [xix. 3], وَاْشْتَعَلَ الرَّاْسُ شَيْبًا, (S,) meaning <i>And whiteness of the hair of the head hath spread therein like as the radiance of fire spreads in firewood,</i> (Jel,) [or <i>the head has become glistening with whiteness of the hair,</i> or <i>hoariness,</i>] شيبا is in the accus. case as a specificative: or, accord. to Akh, as an inf. n., as though it were said وَشَابَ الرَّاْسُ شَيْبًا.
