      شَيْخُونٌ, (K,) but the latter is a strange word, mentioned by some of the expositors of the Fs, as expressing more than the former word, (MF,) [<i>An old,</i> or <i>elderly, man; an elder,</i> as meaning <i>a man whose age gives him a claim to reverence</i> or <i>respect; a senior;</i>] <i>one advanced in age,</i> (Mgh,) <i>such as is beyond him who is termed</i> <br>\

                  مَشِيخَةِ الكَرَم and من اَشْيَاخِهِ, which is tropical, meaning مِنْ ا=بَايِهِ: but the right reading is evidently ↓ <br>\
      من مَشِيخَتِهِ, and الكَرَمَ; and the meaning, (tropical:)  <i>He inherited, from his ancestors, generosity.</i>] ―         -b5-  شَيْخُ النَّارِ means (tropical:)  <i>Iblees:</i> because he was created of fire, or because his ultimate place will be the fire of Hell.

                  النُّجُومِ as is related by Th, (TA in art. سنخ,) means <i>the stars that do not make their</i> [<i>temporary</i>] <i>abode in the Mansions of the Moon, which</i> [<i>latter</i>] <i>are called</i> <br>\
                  نُجُومُ الاَخْذِ: ISd says, I think that he means, by the نجوم, the fixed stars: Th says that they are called only اَسْنَاخُ النُّجُومِ, i. e. the اُصُول thereof, around which the [other] stars revolve, and pursue their courses.
