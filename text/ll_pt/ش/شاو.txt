                  , (Ham p. 786,) inf. n. شَاْوٌ, (AZ, S, K,) <i>I preceded,</i> or <i>outwent, the people,</i> or <i>party.</i> (AZ, S, K. *) Accord. to [several of] the copies of the K, شَا=ءَهُ i. e. like شَاعَهُ in measure, which is incorrect, [in other copies ↓ <br>\
      شَا=ءَاهُ, agreeably with what is said in the S,] signifies <i>He strove,</i> or <i>contended, with him to precede him,</i> or <i>outgo him:</i> or <i>he preceded him,</i> or <i>outwent him:</i> but in the S it is said, شَا=ءَاهُ, of the measure فَاعَلَهُ, signifies <i>he strove,</i> or <i>contended, with him to precede him,</i> or <i>outgo him:</i> and شَا=ءَهُ like شَاَاهُ, [the former belonging to art. شوا and] formed by transposition, signifies <i>he preceded him,</i> or <i>outwent him;</i> and both of these are used by the poet (El-Hárith Ibn-Khálid El-Makhzoomee, TA) in his saying, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        مَرَّ الحُدُوجُ وَمَا شَاَوْنَكَ نَقْرَةً<br>\

                        وَلَقَدْ اَرَاكَ تُشَا=ءُ بِالاَظْعَانِ<br>\
                  </quote> this [passage in the S], however, is taken from what is said by A&#39;Obeyd, in [his work] “ ElGhareeb el-Musannaf, ” which is as follows: شَا=ءَنِى الاَمْرُ, like شَاعَنِى [in measure], and شَا=نِى, like شَعَانِى, mean <i>the affair,</i> or <i>event, grieved me;</i> and thus in the verse of El-Hárith Ibn-Khálid, which he cites; and the same is said in the T on the authority of IAar, who says that the poet has used two dial. vars.: [accordingly the verse may be rendered, <i>The camels with their saddles upon them passed along and they grieved thee not at all; but I see thee that thou art grieved by the women borne in the camel-vehicles:</i>] it is said in the M, شَا=ءَنِى الشَّىْءُ means <i>the thing preceded me,</i> or <i>outwent me:</i> and also <i>the thing grieved me:</i> formed by transposition from شَا=نِى, as is proved by its having no inf. n.: IAar says that they are two dial. vars. because of his not being a grammarian. (TA.) [See also 8.]       -A2-  And شَاَوْتُ البِيْرَ, (Lh, TA,) or شاوت مِنَ البِيْرِ, (S,) inf. n. شَاْوٌ, (K, TA,) <i>I drew forth the earth from the well:</i> (S, K: *) or <i>I drew forth a basketful of earth</i> (شَاْوًا) or <i>two basketfuls of earth</i> (شَاْوَيْنِ) <i>from the well.</i> (Lh, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                  : see 1. يُشَاوِى occurs in a verse of Milhah El-Jarmee, meaning يُسَابِقُ, from شَاْوٌ meaning طَلَقٌ: one says شَاَاهُ, aor. يَشْاَاهُ, meaning سَبَقَهُ: but the verb of the measure regularly formed from الشَّاْوُ is شَا=ءى; so that يشاوى is formed by transposition and by the change of the ء into ى.
