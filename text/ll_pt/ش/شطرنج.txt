                   (O, L, Msb, K) and شَطْرَنْجٌ; (L, Msb;) some say the former; and some, the latter; (Msb;) the latter said to be of established authority, as a dial. var., though disallowed in the K [and in the O]; but the former is the more approved on account of its being conformable with Arabic words, (Msb, TA,) such as جِرْدَحْلٌ, (TA,) which the latter is not; (Msb, TA;) and sometimes it is pronounced with the unpointed س, (O,) this being a dial. var.; (K;) <i>A wellknown game;</i> [namely, <i>chess:</i>] (O, L, K:) a Pers. word, (TA,) arabicized; (Msb, K, TA;) [said to be] from صَدْ رَنْگ “ a hundred stratagems; ” or from شُدْ رَنْج “ trouble departed, ” meaning that trouble departs from him who plays at it; (TA;) [or from شَاهْ رَنْج “ the royal care or sorrow; ” or from شَشْ رَنْگ “ six species or ranks, ” because the pieces are of so many species: (Richardson&#39;s Pers. Arab. and Engl. Dict., Johnson&#39;s ed.:)] or [accord. to some] it is from الشَّطَارَةُ, (O, K,) or المُشَاطَرَةُ, referring to the word شطرنج; (TA;) or from التَّسْطِيرُ, (O, K,) referring to the word سطرنج; so says Ibn-Hishám El-Lakhmee: but, as IB and others have said, these derivations are only partial, making the ن and the ج to be augmentative letters, and are manifestly incorrect.
