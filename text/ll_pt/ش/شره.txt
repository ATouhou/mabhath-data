                  شَراهِيًّا;] which is said in the K to be a mistake accord. to the assertion of the learned men of the Jews: but this, which is said to be a mistake, is what commonly obtains in the books of the people, [i. e. of the Jews,] and they seldom, or never, pronounce it otherwise than thus: As says that the vulgar say يَا هِيَا, which is post-classical; correctly يَا هَيَاهَ [or يَا هَيَا], with fet-h to the ء: AHát says, I think it to be originally يَا هَيَا شراهيا [which is inconsistent with the Hebrew]: and Ibn-Buzurj says, they said يَا هِيَا and يَا هَيَا in speaking to one from a near place.
