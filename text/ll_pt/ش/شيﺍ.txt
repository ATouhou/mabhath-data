(TA.) [مَا شَا=ءَ اْللّٰهُ as signifying &lt;i&gt;What hath God willed!&lt;/i&gt; is used to express admiration.

      مَشِيْيَةٌ (pl. مَشِيْا=تٌ) is often used,] &lt;i&gt;without restriction to its actuality or possibility of being,&lt;/i&gt; so that it applies to &lt;i&gt;that which necessarily is,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;that which may be,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;that which cannot be;&lt;/i&gt; accord. to the opinion adopted by the author of the Ksh: [or, as an inf. n. in the sense of a pass. part. n., it may be expl., agreeably with what is said to be the proper meaning of the verb, as signifying &lt;i&gt;what is caused to be&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;exist;&lt;/i&gt; accordingly,] Er-Rághib says that it denotes &lt;i&gt;whatever is caused to be&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;exist, whether sensibly, as material substances,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;ideally, as sayings;&lt;/i&gt; and Bd and others expressly assert that it signifies peculiarly &lt;i&gt;what is caused to be&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;exist;&lt;/i&gt; but Sb says that it is the most general of general terms; and some of the scholastic theologians apply it to &lt;i&gt;what is non-existent;&lt;/i&gt; such, however, are overcome in their argument by its not being found to have been thus used by the Arabs, and by such passages as كُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ اـِلَّا وَجْهَهُ [&lt;i&gt;Everything is subject to perish except Himself&lt;/i&gt; (Kur xxviii. last verse)] and وَاـِنْ مِنْ شَىْءٍ اـِلَّا يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِهِ [&lt;i&gt;And there is not anything but it glorifies Him with praising&lt;/i&gt; (Kur xvii. 46)], for what is nonexistent cannot be described as perishing nor imagined to glorify God: (TA:) the pl. is اَشْيَا=ءُ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.,) imperfectly decl., (Msb, TA,) or rather this is a quasi-pl. n., (Sb, TA,) respecting the formation of which there is much difference of opinion [as will be shown hereafter], (Msb, TA,) and اَشْيَاوَاتٌ, (S, K,) a pl. pl. [i. e. pl. of اَشْيَا=ءٌ], (MF, TA,) and اَشَاوَاتٌ, [a contraction of that next preceding,] (K,) and اَشَاوَى, (S, K,) with fet-h to the و, (MF, TA,) and it is also mentioned as with kesr, (TA,) [and is written in both of my copies of the S اَشَاوَى, though if with kesr it should be either اَشَاوٍ or اَشَاوِىُّ, but اَشَاوَى only is meant by J, as is shown by what here follows,] originally اَشَايِىُّ, with three ى s, not اَشَايِىُّ as J says, [or rather as the word is written in copies of the S, for J may have held it to be اَشَايِىُّ or اَشَايِىْءُ, as he says that the ء was changed into ى thus occasioning the combination of three ىs, so that he held its secondary form to be اَشَايِىُّ, as will presently be shown,] because the first ى is radical, not augmentative, (IB, K,) the medial ى of the three being suppressed, and the final one changed into ا [though written ى], and the initial one changed into و, (S,) and another form of pl. is اَشَايَا, (S, Msb, K,) with the ى preserved, not changed into و [as it is in اَشَاوَى], (TA,) [likewise] a pl. of اَشْيَا=ءُ, (Msb,) and اَشَيَايَا also is mentioned, (K,) as formed [from اَشْيَا=ءُ] by the change of ء into ى and adding ا, (TA,) and اَشَاوِهُ, which is strange, (Lh, K,) as there is no ه in اَشَيَا=ءُ, (Lh,) or in شَىْءٌ: (K:) with respect to the first of these forms, [the quasi-pl. n.] اَشَيَا=ءُ, the most probable opinion is that of Kh: (Msb, TA:) accord. to him, (S, Msb, K,) it is originally of the measure فَعْلَا=ءُ, (S, K, *) in lieu of اَفْعَالٌ, (K,) and therefore imperfectly decl., (S,) [i. e.] it is originally شَيْيَا=ءُ, (Msb,) and the two hemzehs combined in the latter portion being found difficult of pronunciation, the former of them is transposed to the beginning of the word, so that it becomes of the measure لَفْعَا=ءُ, (S, Msb,) as is shown by its having for its pls. اَشَاوَى and اَشَايَا and اَشْيَاوَاتٌ: (S:) accord. to Akh, it is [originally] of the measure اَفْعِلَا=ءُ; (S, K;) but if it were thus a broken pl., [not a quasi-pl. n.,] its dim. would not be ↓ <br>\
      اُشْيَّا=ءُ, as it is, but شُيَيْا=تٌ: (S:) accord. to Ks, it is of the measure اَفْعَالٌ, and made imperfectly decl. because of frequency of usage, being likened to فَعْلَا=ءُ; but were it so, اَبْنَا=ء and اَسْمَا=ء would be imperfectly decl.: (S, K:) accord. to Fr, شَىْءٌ is originally شَيِّيٌ, and therefore has a pl. of the measure اَفْعِلَا=ءُ, afterwards contracted to فَعْلَا=ءُ; but were it so, it would not have for its pl. اَشَاوَى. (S. [Much more respecting this pl. is added in the TA, but it is comparatively unprofitable.]) The dim. of شَىْءٌ is ↓ <br>\
      شُيَىْءٌ and ↓ <br>\
      شِيَىْءٌ; (S, K, TA, but only the former in some copies of the K, the word being written in other copies شُِيَىْءٌ;) not ↓ <br>\
      شُوَىٌّ, or ↓ <br>\
      شُوَىْءٌ; (the former accord. to my two copies of the S and accord. to the copies of the K followed in the TA, in which it is said to be with teshdeed to the ى, and the latter accord. to the CK and my MS. copy of the K;) or this is a dial. var. of weak authority, (K,) used by post-classical poets in their verses. (MF, TA.) ―         -b2-  When a man says to thee, “ What dost thou desire? ” thou answerest, لَا شَيْيًا [&lt;i&gt;Nothing&lt;/i&gt;]: and when he says, “ Why didst thou that? ” thou answerest, لِلَا شَىْءٍ [&lt;i&gt;For nothing&lt;/i&gt;]: and when he says, “ What is thine affair? ” thou answerest, لَا شَىْءٌ [&lt;i&gt;Nothing&lt;/i&gt;]: it is with tenween in every one of these cases. (As, AHát, TA.) [When one says لَا شَىْءَ, he means thereby &lt;i&gt;There is nothing.&lt;/i&gt;] ―         -b3-  لَيْسَ بِشَىْءٍ means [&lt;i&gt;It is nought, of no account&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;weight; it is not worthy of notice,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;not worth anything;&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;it is not a good thing;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;it is not a thing to be regarded.&lt;/i&gt; (W p. 27.) ―         -b4-  [لَيْسَ مِنَ الاَمْرِ <br>\
                  فِى شَىْءٍ is a phrase of frequent occurrence, meaning &lt;i&gt;He has no concern with the affair;&lt;/i&gt; see two exs. in the first paragraph of art. حوص. ―         -b5-  فِيهِ شَىْءٍِ مِنَ الطُّولِ occurs in the TA voce حُسْبَانَةٌ, meaning &lt;i&gt;In it is somewhat,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;some degree, of length;&lt;/i&gt; i. e. &lt;i&gt;it is somewhat long;&lt;/i&gt; and is used in the present day in this sense.] ―         -b6-  In the phrase هُوَ اَحْسَنُ مِنْكَ شَيْيًا, the last word is for بِشَىْءٍ [i. e. &lt;i&gt;He is better than thou in something;&lt;/i&gt; meaning &lt;i&gt;he is somewhat better than thou&lt;/i&gt;]. (IJ, L.) ―         -b7-  مَا اَغْفَلَهُ عَنْكَ شَيْيًا is a phrase of the Arabs [app. lit. signifying &lt;i&gt;How unmindful of thee is he as to anything!&lt;/i&gt;] mentioned by Sb as meaning دَعِ الشَّكَّ <br>\
                  عَنْكَ [&lt;i&gt;Dismiss doubt from thee&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;respecting him as to anything&lt;/i&gt;)]: IJ says that شييا is here put in the accus. case as an inf. n., as though the saying were مَا اَغْفَلَهُ عَنْكَ غُفُولًا, because the verb of wonder does not require to be corroborated by the inf. n. [proper to it]: (L, TA:) [or it is a specificative:] IF says that it is a phrase of dubious meaning; and that the most probable explanation of it is this; that ما is here lit. interrogative, but in meaning denotative of wonder; and that شييا is governed in the accus. case by some other word, or phrase, as though the saying were &lt;i&gt;dismiss a thing by which he is not occupied in mind, and dismiss doubt as to his being occupied in mind by it.&lt;/i&gt; (TA in art. ما.) ―         -b8-  [شَيْيًا فَشَيْيًا means &lt;i&gt;Thing by thing, part by part, bit by bit, piecemeal, inch by inch, drop by drop, little and little in succession, by little and little, by degrees&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;gradually.&lt;/i&gt;] ―         -b9-  اَىُّ شَىْءٍ [meaning &lt;i&gt;What thing?&lt;/i&gt;] is, by the alleviation of the ى [in اىّ] and the suppression of the ء [in شىء], made into one word, اَيْشَىْ: so says El-Fárábee: (Msb:) or, [as is commonly the case in the present day,] by reason of frequency of usage, it is contracted into اَيْشَ. (TA in art. جرم, as on the authority of Ks.) ―         -b10-  شَىْءٌ in the Kur lx. 11 may mean &lt;i&gt;Any one&lt;/i&gt; (Bd, Jel) or &lt;i&gt;more.&lt;/i&gt; (Jel.) ―         -b11-  [It is also applied to (assumed tropical:)  The &lt;i&gt;penis&lt;/i&gt; of a man; as in the explanation of a phrase mentioned voce ذَنَبٌ; like as its syn. هَنٌ is to the same and (more commonly) to the “ vulva ” of a woman.] ―         -b12-  In algebra, it signifies [&lt;i&gt;A square root;&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;a number that is multiplied into itself;&lt;/i&gt; which in arithmetic [and in algebra also] is called جذر [i. e. جَذْرٌ]; and in geometry, ضلع [i. e. ضِلْعٌ or ضِلَعٌ]; (“ Dict. of the Techn.
