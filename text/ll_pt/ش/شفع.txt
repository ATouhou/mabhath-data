                  شَفِيع [i. e. <i>an intercessor</i>], in doing good or evil, so that he aids him, or partakes with him, in [procuring] the benefit or the harm thereof; and thus it means in the saying in the Kur [iv. 87], مَنْ يَشْفَعْ شَفَاعَةً حَسَنَةً [and in what follows the same]: (TA:) or these words mean <i>Whoso adds a</i> [<i>good</i>] <i>deed to a</i> [<i>good</i>] <i>deed:</i> (O, K:) or, as some say, the شفاعة here is a man&#39;s <i>instituting,</i> or <i>prescribing, to another, a way of good</i> or <i>evil, so that he</i> [the latter] <i>imitates him, and thus becomes as though he were to him one of a pair.</i> (TA.)

      اِشْفَعْ تُشَفَّعْ [<i>Intercede thou: thou shalt have thine intercession accepted</i>]. (TA.) The saying in the Kur [ii. 117], وَلَا تَنْفَعُهَا شَفَاعَةٌ [<i>Nor shall intercession profit it</i>] means that it shall have no شَافِع [or intercessor] for his شَفَاعَة [or intercession] to profit it; being a denial of the شَافِع; (Ibn- &#39;Arafeh, O, K;) and the same is the case in the Kur lxxiv. 49, (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, O, TA,) and xx. 108. (TA.) شَفَعَ, inf. n. شَفْعٌ and شَفَاعَةٌ, also signifies <i>He prayed,</i> or <i>supplicated:</i> and thus Mbr and Th explain the words of the Kur [ii. 256], مَنْ ذَا اْلَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ اـِلَّا بِاـِذْنِهِ [<i>Who is he that shall pray,</i> or <i>supplicate, in his presence, except by his permission?</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b5-  Accord. to El-Kutabee, (Mgh,) [i. e.] El-Kuteybee, (TA,) one says also, of a neighbour of one who desires to sell a dwelling [or land] شَفَعَ اـِلَيْهِ فِى مَا بَاعَ, meaning <i>He made a demand to him,</i> i. e. to the latter, <i>respecting that which he sold</i> [<i>for the right of pre-emption</i>]: and of the latter person, ↓ <br>\
      فَشَفَّعَهُ [<i>and he admitted his right of pre-emption,</i> i. e.] <i>and he pronounced him to have a better right,</i> or <i>title,</i> or <i>claim,</i> [<i>as a purchaser,</i>] to that which was sold, <i>that he whose connexion was more remote.</i> (Mgh, TA. *)       -A2-  شَفَعَ, inf. n. شَفْعٌ, signifies also <i>He,</i> or <i>it, was,</i> or <i>became, tall,</i> or <i>high.</i> (TA.)       -A3-  And شُفِعَ, like عُنِىَ, <i>He</i> (a man) <i>was smitten by the</i> [<i>evil</i>] <i>eye.</i> (IKtt, TA.

(Mgh.) We have not heard, (Mgh,) or there is not known, (Msb,) any verb belonging to it [in the classical language]. (Mgh, Msb.)
