      تَشَاكُلٌ: (IDrd, S, K:) Er-Rághib [strangely] says that المُشَاكَلَةُ is from الشَّكْلُ signifying “ the binding, ” or “ shackling, ” a beast [with the شِكَال]. (TA.) You say, هُوَ يُشَاكِلُهُ [<i>He,</i> or <i>it, is conformable,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>with him,</i> or <i>it;</i> or <i>resembles him,</i> or <i>it</i>]. (Msb.)

                   [primarily] signifies صَارَ ذَا شَكْلٍ [meaning <i>It,</i> or <i>he, was,</i> or <i>became, such as had a likeness</i> or <i>resemblance,</i> or <i>a like,</i> or <i>match,</i> &amp;amp;c.].

      اشتكل is mentioned in this sense by Golius as on the authority of J (whom I do not find to have mentioned it either in this art. or elsewhere), and by Freytag as on the authority of Abu-l-&#39;Alà: accord. to Sh, اشكل in this sense is from شُكْلَةٌ signifying “ redness mixed with whiteness: ” (see مُشْكِلٌ:) but] accord. to Er-Rághib, اـِشْكَالٌ in a thing, or case, or an affair, is metaphorical, [and] like اِشْتِبَاهٌ from الشِبْهُ. (TA.) One says, اشكل الاَمْرُ عَلَى الرَّجُلِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>The thing,</i> or <i>case,</i> or <i>affair, was,</i> or <i>became, dubious,</i> or <i>confused, to the man</i>]; and ↓ <br>\
      شَكَلَ means the same. (Zj, O.) And اَشْكَلَتْ عَلَىَّ الاَخْبَارُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>The tidings were dubious,</i> or <i>confused, to me</i>], and اَحْكَلَتْ; both meaning the same. (TA.) And one says also, عَلَيْهِ اـِشْكَالٌ and عليه اـِشْكَالَاتٌ [meaning <i>There is doubt,</i> or <i>uncertainty,</i> and <i>there are doubts,</i> or <i>uncertainties, respecting it:</i> thus using the inf. n. as a simple subst., and therefore pluralizing it]. (Mz, 3rd نوع; &amp;amp;c.) ―         -b3-  It is also said of a disease; [app. as meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>It became nearly cured;</i> because still in a somewhat doubtful state;] like as you say تَمَاثَلَ; and so ↓ <br>\
