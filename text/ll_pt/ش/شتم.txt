<b>شَتَمَهُ</b>               1     <br>\

                     شَتُمَ<br>\
                  , (K,) inf. n. شَتْمٌ (S, MA, Msb, K) and مَشْتَمَةٌ and مَشْتُمَةٌ, (K, TA,) the last of these [written مَشْتِمَة in the CK] with damm to the ت, or this and the next before it, though said to be inf. ns., may be simple substantives, as A&#39;Obeyd inclines to think them, (TA,) <i>He reviled him, vilified him, upbraided him, reproached him, defamed him,</i> or <i>gave a bad name to him;</i> (S, * MA, K, TA;) syn. سَبَّهُ: (K, TA:) or, as some say, شَتْمٌ signifies [the <i>addressing with</i>] <i>foul speech, without</i> <br>\
                  قَذْف [here meaning the <i>casting an accusation,</i> though commonly used and expl. as syn. with شَتْمٌ]: (TA:) and ↓ <br>\
      شاتمهُ signifies the same as شَتَمَهُ, (MA, Msb,) being a rare instance of a verb of the measure فَاعَلَ denoting an act of a single agent when it has an unaugmented verb of the same radical letters [and the same signification], as صَادَمَهُ الحِمَارُ meaning صَدَمَهُ, and زَاحِمَهُ meaning زَحَمَهُ. (Msb.) Hence the saying, فَاـِنْ شُتِمَ فَلْيَعُلْ اـِنِّى صَايِمٌ [<i>And if he be reviled, let him say, Verily I am fasting</i>], which may mean that he should say this with his tongue, which is the more proper meaning, or mentally: or ↓ <br>\
      فَاـِنْ شُوتِمَ, which is allowable, though the former is the more proper. (Msb.) ―         -b2-  شاتمهُ <br>\

                  , accord. to Reiske, said of a camel when haltered, and of a lion, as mentioned by Freytag, signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>He was harsh, and surly, in countenance, and uttered a grumbling sound:</i> if used, it must be شُتِّمَ, agreeably with the part. n., expl. below.]    </entryFree> <br>\

                   is <i>syn. with</i> <br>\

      تَشَاتُمٌ is <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  تَسَابٌّ, (S,) signifying as above [but used in relation to two persons and more than two]: (KL:) you say, شَاتَمَا and ↓ <br>\
      تَشَاتَمَا meaning تَسَابَّا [<i>They reviled, vilified,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>each other</i>]: (K:) and ↓ <br>\
      تشاتموا <br>\
                  <i>They reviled,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>one another;</i> like تَسَابُّوا. (MA.) [شاتمهُ may therefore be rendered <i>He reviled him,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>being reviled,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>by him:</i> but sometimes it is syn. with شَتَمَهُ:] see 1, in two places. ―         -b2-  One says also, ↓ <br>\

                   is said by Freytag to signify <i>He exposed himself to contumelies;</i> on the authority of the Ham p. 310: but I there find only the part. n., مُتَشَتِّمٌ, signifying as expl. below: so that the verb, if used, means <i>he became exasperated by reviling, vilifying,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>and addressed,</i> or <i>applied, himself thereto.</i> ―         -b2-  He also explains it as signifying (assumed tropical:)  <i>He contracted the face very austerely;</i> on the authority of the Deewán of the Hudhalees.]    </entryFree> <br>\
