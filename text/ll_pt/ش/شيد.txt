                  , aor. يَشِيدُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. شَيْدٌ, (S,) <i>He plastered it</i> (a wall) <i>with</i> <br>\
                  شِيد, (S, K,) i. e. <i>gypsum,</i> or <i>the like:</i> (K:) <i>he built it</i> (a structure) <i>with</i> <br>\
                  شِيد, meaning <i>gypsum.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b2-  See also 2. ―         -b3-  شَادُوا الدِّينَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>They strengthened and exalted the religion:</i> from شَادَ in the first of the senses expl. above: (Har p. 5:) [or rather from this verb as syn. with شَيَّدَ and اَشَادَ.] ―         -b4-  See also 4. ―         -b5-  As inf. n. of شَادَ in the phrase شَادَ بِالاـِبِلِ, aor. as above, (TK,) شِيَادٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The <i>calling</i> camels, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K, TA,) as also ↓ <br>\
      اـِشَادَةٌ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,) <i>raising the voice in doing so.</i> (TA.) ―         -b6-  Also, (K,) as inf. n. of the same verb, (TK,) (assumed tropical:)  The <i>rubbing</i> perfume with the skin; (K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      تَشَيُّدٌ; in some copies of the K, ↓ <br>\
      تَشْيِيدٌ: (TA:) [the former of these two seems to be the right; and the meaning seems to be, the <i>rubbing the skin</i> with perfume; for,] accord. to AA, one says بِهٰذَا الطِّيبِ ↓ <br>\
      تَشَيَّدْ, meaning <i>Rub thy skin with this perfume.</i> (O.)       -A2-  شَادَ, (said of a man, TA,) aor. as above, (K,) inf. n. شَيْدٌ, (TA,) also signifies <i>He perished,</i> or <i>died.</i> (K.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>شيّدهُ</b>               1     <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                  , (A, L, Msb, TA,) inf. n. تَشْيِيدٌ, (L, Msb, TA,) <i>He raised it high;</i> (A, Msb, TA;) namely, a palace, (A,) or a building; (Msb, TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
      اشادهُ, (A, L, TA,) and ↓ <br>\
      شَادَهُ: (A: [this last is app. included with the two other verbs, in the A, as having this meaning, which is confirmed, as pertaining to it, by an explanation of its pass. part. n., مَشِيدٌ, q. v.:]) or شيّدهُ [implies a repetition of the act of building: (see مَشِيدٌ:) or] signifies <i>he built it firmly,</i> or <i>strongly, and raised it high.</i> (L.) ―         -b2-  See also 1.    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>اشادهُ</b>               1     <br>\
                     اشادهُ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  : see 2. ―         -b2-  Hence, (L,) اـِشَادَةٌ signifies (tropical:)  The <i>raising the voice</i> in saying a thing (Lth, S, L, K) [of any kind, or] such as one&#39;s companion dislikes; like تَنْدِيدٌ. (Lth, L.) See also 1. You say, اشاد صَوْتَهُ and بِصَوْتِهِ (tropical:)  <i>He raised his voice.</i> (A.) And اشاد بِهِ (tropical:)  <i>He proclaimed it,</i> or <i>cried it, raising his voice;</i> namely, a stray, or any other thing: (As, L:) (tropical:)  <i>he made it known;</i> (AA, S, A,  K; *) namely, a stray. (S, K.) And اشاد بِذِكْرِهِ (tropical:)  <i>He raised his good fame, by praising him; raised a good report of him:</i> (S, * A, L:) and <i>he raised his ill fame, by dispraising him; raised an evil report of him:</i> and اشادهُ and ↓ <br>\
      شَادَهُ <br>\
                  <i>he raised his notoriety</i> or <i>fame.</i> (L.) And اشاد عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  <i>He published against him</i> something disliked, disapproved, or odious: one says, اشاد عَلَيْهِ قَبِيحًا and بِقَبِيحٍ (tropical:)  [<i>He published against him something bad, evil, abominable,</i> or <i>foul</i>]. (A.) ―         -b3-  And اـِشَادَةٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The act of <i>destroying:</i> (K, TA:) from the same word as syn. with تَنْدِيدٌ. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

<b>شَيْدٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     شَيْدٌ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  , a Pers. word, [or rather of Pers. origin, from شَيْدَا,] <i>Possessed;</i> or <i>mad,</i> or <i>insane:</i> or <i>intoxicated.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>شِيدٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     شِيدٌ<br>\

                  <i>Anything with which a wall is plastered,</i> (S, A, K,) consisting of <i>gypsum</i> and <i>the like;</i> (A, K;) J says, of <i>gypsum</i> or بَلَاط; but this last word is a mistake, [probably originated by an early transcriber of the S,] for مِلَاط, i. e. <i>mud,</i> or <i>clay:</i> (K:) or [peculiarly] <i>gypsum.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b2-  Az says that some of the Arabs sometimes call thus <i>A</i> <br>\
                  حِصْن [i. e. <i>fortress, fort,</i> or <i>fortified place</i>]. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>مَشِيدٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     مَشِيدٌ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>Plastered with</i> <br>\
                  شِيد; and so, as some say, ↓ <br>\
      مُشَيَّدٌ: (T:) or <i>built with gypsum:</i> (Msb:) or <i>made with</i> <br>\
                  شيد, (S, A, K,) i. e. <i>gypsum;</i> and so, some say, ↓ <br>\
      مُشَيَّدٌ: (A:) or the latter signifies <i>raised high,</i> or <i>made lofty;</i> (A &#39;Obeyd, S, A, K;) and so the former, applied to a place, (A,) or building: (TA:) the former has this meaning in the Kur xxii. 44: (Jel:) J says in the S, Ks says, مَشِيدٌ is applied to a sing., from the saying in the Kur, [ubi suprà,] وَقَصْرٍ مَشِيدٍ; and ↓ <br>\
      مُشَيَّدٌ, to a pl., from the saying in the same, [iv. 80,] فِى بُرُوجٍ مُشَيَّدَةٍ: but this is a mistake: what Ks says is that مُشَيَّدَةٌ, with ة and teshdeed, is a pl. [i. e. a lexicological, not a grammatical, pl.] of مُشَيَّدٌ: (IB, K: *) or the saying of Ks [if as quoted in the S] may be expl. accord. to the opinion of those who hold that مَشِيدٌ and مُشَيَّدٌ both signify <i>plastered with</i> <br>\
                  شِيد, on the supposition that the Arabs did not use مَشِيدَةٌ as applied to a pl., but only to a sing.: (Az, L:) [for] Fr says that the pass. part. n. of the unaugmented verb only is used when applied to a sing. and not denoting repetition, or muchness; but either this or the pass. part. n. of the verb of the measure فَعَّلَ may be used when applied to a sing. and denoting repetition, or muchness, and when applied to a pl.: thus you say كَبْشٌ مَذْبُوحٌ [“ a slaughtered ram ”]; but not مُذَبَّحٌ; but you may say ثَوْبٌ <br>\
                  مُخَرَّقٌ [as meaning “ a garment in which holes have been repeatedly made, ” or “ in which many holes have been made, ” or “ much pierced with holes, ” as well as ثَوْبٌ مَخْرُوقٌ meaning “ a garment in which a hole has been made, ” or “ in which holes have been made, ”] and كِبَاشٌ مُذَبَّحَةٌ [“ slaughtered rams ”]: and hence you may say ↓ <br>\
      قَصْرٌ مُشَيَّدٌ; because تَشْيِيدٌ denotes building, and the act of building is repeated, and a building becomes high by degrees. (L.)    </entryFree> <br>\
