                  وظيف; thus in the T. (TA.) AO says that تَحَرُّكُ الشَّظَى [i. e. <i>The motion of the</i> <br>\
                  شظى from its place (see 1)] is like what is termed اِنْتِشَارُ <br>\

      شِظِىٌّ, (K, TA, [in the latter as omitted in the K, with kesr to the ش on account of the same vowel-sound following,]) mentioned by Sgh, from Ks. (TA.)
