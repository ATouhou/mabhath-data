                  , (Msb, K,) inf. n. شَنْءٌ (AO, S, Msb, K) and شِنْءٌ and شُنْءٌ (Aboo- &#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee, S, K) and شَنْاَةٌ (K, TA, in the CK شَناءَة [i. e. شَنَا=ءَةٌ, which is afterwards added in the TA, not as in the K, and mentioned in the S but not there said to be an inf. n.,]) and شَنَاٌ (TA from Es-Safákusee) and شَنَا=ءٌ (TA [as from J, but perhaps from Az, for I do not find it in the S,]) and مَشْنَاٌ (S, CK, and TA as from Es-Safá- kusee, not as from the K,) and مَشْنَاَةٌ and مَشْنُوَةٌ (K, TA, the last in the CK مَشْنُوءَة [i. e. مَشْنُوْءَةٌ],) and مَشْنِيَةٌ (TA from Es-Safákusee) and شَنَا=نٌ, (S, K,) which is anomalous as being of a measure regularly employed [only] for the inf. n. of a verb signifying motion and agitation, as ضَرَبَانٌ and خَفَقَانٌ, (S, TA,) for though it has been said that [hatred (which it signifies) is attended by anger and] anger is accompanied by agitation of the heart, there is no necessary connection between hatred and anger, and it is anomalous also as being of a measure not proper to [the inf. n. of] a trans. verb, (TA,) and شَنْا=نٌ, (S, Msb, K,) which is also anomalous, and [said to be] the only instance of its kind (S, TA) except لَيَّانٌ, though some few others have been mentioned, as زَيْدَانٌ, but this is not well known, [and خَشْيَانٌ, of which the same may be said,] and وَشْكَانٌ [perhaps a simple subst.], and جَوْلَانٌ which is said to occur in a verse [perhaps contracted from جَوَلَان by poetic license], (TA,) and AO mentions شَنَانٌ, without ء, as being like شَنْا=نٌ; (S;) these inf. ns. being fourteen, which is said by IKtt to be the greatest number of inf. ns. to any one verb, only seven other verbs, he says, having this number, namely, قَدَرَ, لَقِىَ, وَرَدَ, هَلَكَ, تَمَّ, مَكَثَ and غَلَبَ; but Es-Safákusee makes the inf. ns. of شَنِيَ to be fifteen, [though the fifteenth form (which is perhaps مَشْنُوْءَةٌ) I do not find mentioned,] and this is the greatest number known; (TA;) <i>He hated him:</i> (IKoot, IF, S, ISd, IKtt, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.:) or, as some say, <i>he hated him vehemently.</i> (TA.) يشنى, [app. يُشْنَى, for يُشْنَاُ,] with the hemzeh changed into ى, occurs in a trad.

(TA.) ―         -b3-  [And accord. to Reiske, as stated by Freytag, (who has written it ↓ <br>\
