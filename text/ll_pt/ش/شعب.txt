(TA.) [Hence, as it seems to be indicated in the S and A, or from شَعْبٌ meaning “ a tribe, ” as it seems to be indicated in the Ham p. 538,] one says, تَفَرَّقَ شَعْبُهُمْ, (S,) or شَتَّ شَعْبُهُمْ, (A, Ham,) (tropical:)  [<i>Their union became dissolved,</i> or <i>broken up;</i> or <i>their tribe became separated;</i>] meaning <i>they became separated after being congregated:</i> (S, Ham:) and اِلْتَاَمَ شَعْبُهُمْ (S, A, Ham) (tropical:)  [<i>Their separation became closed up,</i> or <i>their tribe drew together;</i>] meaning <i>they drew together after being separated.</i> (S, Ham.) And شَعَبَتْهُمُ المَنِيَّةُ <br>\
                  <i>Death separated them:</i> (S:) and شَعَبَتْهُ شَعُوبُ [<i>Death separated him</i> from his companions]; (TA;) said of a man when he has died. (O in art. عبل: in the K, in that art., ↓ <br>\

(TA. [IB&#39;s explanations seem at first sight to indicate that he read شَعُوبَ and شَعُوبًا; neither of which is admissible: each of his explanations app. relates to both readings; as though he understood the poet to mean, they were men separated from different tribes, to be overtaken by others; so they perished.])    </entryFree> <br>\

      انشعب are quasi-pass. verbs, the former of شَعَّبَ and the latter of شَعَبَ: (TA:) [the former, therefore, is most correctly to be regarded and used as intensive in its significations, or as relating to several things or persons: but it is said that] both signify alike: [app. <i>It became collected; it became brought, gathered,</i> or <i>drawn, together;</i> or <i>it became united:</i> and also] <i>it became separated, put apart</i> or <i>asunder, divided, disunited,</i> or <i>dispersed</i> or <i>scattered:</i> (S, K:) and <i>it,</i> or <i>he, became distant,</i> or <i>remote.</i> (K.) One says, تَشَعَّبُوا فِى طَلَبِ المِيَاهِ [<i>They became separated,</i> &amp;amp;c., or <i>they separated themselves,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>in search of the waters</i>], and فِى الغَارَاتِ [<i>in predatory excursions</i>].

                  قَبِيلَة; next to which is the فَصِيلَة; then, the عَمَارَة; then, the بَطْن; then, the فَخِذ: (S, TA:) but IB says that the true order is that which Ez-Zubeyr Ibn-Bekkár has stated, and is as follows: (TA:) [i. e.] the genealogies of the Arabs consist of six degrees; (Msb;) first, the شَعْب; then, the قَبِيلَة; then, the عَمَارَة, (Msb, TA,) with fet-h and with kesr, to the ع; (Msb;) then, the بَطْن; then, the فَخِذ; and then, the فَصيلَة: thus, Khuzeymeh is a شعب; and Kináneh, a قبيلَة; and Kureysh, an عمارة; and Kuseí, a بطن; and Háshim, a فخذ; and El-&#39;Abbás, a فصيلة: (Msb, TA:) and Aboo-Usámeh says that these classes are agreeable with the order obtaining in the structure of man; the شعب is the greatest of them, derived from the شَعْب [or suture] of the head; next is the قبيلة, from the قبيلة [which is a term applied to any one of the four principal bones] of the head; then, the عمارة, which is the breast; then, the بطن [or belly]; then, the فخذ [or thigh]; and then, the فصيلة, which is the shank: to these some add the عَشِتيرَة, which consists of few in comparison with what are before mentioned: (TA:) and some add after this the رَهْط: some also add the جِذْم before the شعب: (TA in art. بطن:) the pl. is as above. (TA.) It signifies also <i>A nation, people, race,</i> or <i>family of mankind;</i> syn. جِيلٌ; as expl. by IM and others: in the K, [and in a copy of the A,] erroneously, جَبَل [a mountain]: (TA:) but it is [strangely] said by Aboo-&#39;Obeyd El-Bekree that accord. to all except Bundár, the word in this sense is ↓ <br>\
      شِعْبٌ, with kesr. (MF.) And the pl., شُعُوبٌ, is [said to be] especially applied to denote the <i>foreigners</i> (العَجَم): (TA:) [thus it is said that] the phrase, in a trad., اـِنَّ رَجُلًا مِنَ الشُّعُوبِ <br>\
                  اَسْلَمَ means [<i>Verily a man</i>] <i>of the foreigners</i> (العَجَم) [<i>became a Muslim:</i> but see الشُّعُوبِيَّةُ]. (S.) ―         -b4-  Also, [as implying separation,] <i>Distance,</i> or <i>remoteness.</i> (A, K.) So in the phrase شَعْبُ <br>\
