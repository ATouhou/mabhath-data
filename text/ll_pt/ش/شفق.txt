      شَفَقَةٌ is <i>weakness:</i> (Ham p. 179:) and it is conjoined with خَوْفٌ [fear]; therefore it is not applied as an attribute to God: (Idem p. 722:) [generally] it signifies <i>affection, kindness, benignity, compassion,</i> or <i>favourable inclination:</i> (MA:) [or <i>solicitous affection</i> &amp;amp;c.:] or <i>pity,</i> or <i>compassion, and tenderness, and fear of the betiding of some disliked</i> or <i>evil event, together with faithful</i> or <i>sincere</i> or <i>honest advice.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  شَفَقٌ also signifies The <i>redness</i> (Kh, S, Msb, K) <i>in the horizon</i> (K) <i>from sunset until the time of the last</i> <br>\

                  عَتَمَة: (S:) or the <i>light and redness of the sun, seen at sunset, until the time of the prayer of nightfall:</i> (M:) or the <i>mixture of the light of day with the blackness of night at sunset:</i> (Er-Rághib, TA:) accord. to Zj, the <i>redness that is in the region of sunset after the setting of the sun:</i> this is the meaning given as of common repute in the books of lexicology; and Mtr says [in the Mgh] that it means the <i>redness</i> accord. to a number of the Companions of the Prophet and of the people of the generation next succeeding them: but accord. to Aboo-Hureyreh, it means the <i>whiteness</i> [<i>after sunset,</i> which, to distinguish it from the شَفَق commonly so called, is often termed the white شَفَق, as in an instance above]: (Msb:) IAth says that this word has two contr. meanings; being applied to the <i>redness that is seen after sunset;</i> and to the <i>whiteness remaining in the western horizon after the said redness.</i> (TA.) Fr says, I heard one of the Arabs say, عَلَيْهِ ثَوْبٌ كَاَنَّهُ الشَّفَقُ [<i>Upon him is,</i> or <i>was, a garment as though it were the</i> <br>\

One says, اَنَا فِى اَشْفَاقٍ مِنْ هٰذَا الاَمْرِ i. e. نَوَاحٍ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>I am apart,</i> or <i>aloof, from this affair;</i> as though <i>in,</i> or <i>on, remote sides thereof</i>]: (O, TA:) and in like manner فِى عُرُوضٍ مِنْهُ [app. a mistranscription for عَرُوضٍ i. e. نَاحِيَةٍ] and فى <br>\
