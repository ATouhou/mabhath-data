                  بِالشِّنَانِ is applied to him who will not be abased by misfortunes, nor frightened by that which has no reality: (Sgh and K in art. قع:) or it means, he will not be deceived nor frightened: شِنَان being pl. of شَنٌّ, <i>a dried up skin,</i> which is shaken to a camel to frighten him.
