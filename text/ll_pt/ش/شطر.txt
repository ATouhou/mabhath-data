                   The <i>half</i> of a thing; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      شَطِيرٌ: (TA:) pl. [of pauc.] اَشْطُرٌ (S, K) and [of mult.] شُطُورٌ. (K.) It is said in a prov., اُحْلُبْ حَلَبًا لَكَ شَطْرُهُ [<i>Milk thou a milking of which half shall be for thee</i>]. (S.) And one says شَعَرٌ شَطْرَانِ <br>\
                  <i>Hair</i> [<i>half</i>] <i>black and</i> [<i>half</i>] <i>white.</i> (A.) Accord. to Ibráheem El-Harbee, (O,) the saying of the Prophet, مَنْ مَنَعَ صَدَقَةً فَاـِنَّا ا=خِذُوهَا <br>\
                  وَشَطْرَ مَالِهِ [<i>Whoso refuses to render a poor-rate, verily we take it</i> from him, <i>and half of his property</i>], thus related by Bahz, is a mistake, and the right wording is, وَشُطِرَ مَالُهُ, meaning <i>and his property shall be divided into two halves,</i> and the collector of the poor-rate shall have the option given him and shall take that rate from out of the better of the two halves, as a punishment for the man&#39;s refusal of the rate; (O, K;) but it is said that this law was afterwards abrogated: (O:) Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, however, says that, in the old time, when one refused the poor-rate of his property, it was taken from him, and half of his property was taken as a punishment for his refusal; and he adduces this trad. as evidence thereof; but says that in recent times, only the poor-rate was taken from him, and this trad. was asserted to be abrogated. (TA. [More is there said on this subject, but I omit it as unprofitable.]) ―         -b2-  It occurs in two trads. as meaning <i>Half a</i> <br>\
                  مَكُّوك [q. v.], or <i>half a</i> <br>\
                  وَسْق [q. v.], of barley. (TA.) ―         -b3-  [In prosody, <i>Half a verse.</i>] ―         -b4-  Also (tropical:)  <i>A part,</i> or <i>portion,</i> or <i>somewhat,</i> of a thing; (Mgh, K;) and so ↓ <br>\
      شَطِيرٌ. (TA.) In the trad. of the night-journey, فَوَضَعَ شَطْرَهَا means (assumed tropical:)  [<i>And He remitted</i>] <i>part,</i> or <i>somewhat, thereof;</i> (K;) i. e., of the prayer. (TA.) And similar is the saying in another trad., الطَّهُورُ شَطْرُ الاـِيمَانِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Purification is part of faith</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b5-  Either the <i>fore pair</i> or the <i>hind pair of the teats</i> of a she-camel: she has two pairs of teats, a fore pair and a hind pair, and each pair is thus called: (S, K:) and <i>either of the two teats</i> of a ewe or she-goat: (IAar, TA:) pl. اَشْطُرٌ. (S, TA.) Hence the saying, (S,) فُلَانٌ <br>\
                  حَلَبَ الدَّهْرَ اَشْطُرَهُ (tropical:)  <i>Such a one has known,</i> or <i>tried, varieties of fortune:</i> (S, * TA:) <i>has experienced the good and evil of fortune;</i> (S, K, TA;) <i>its straitness and its ampleness:</i> being likened to one who has milked all the teats of a camel, that which yields plenty of milk and that which does not; the fore pair being the good; and the hind pair, the evil: or, as some say, اَشْطُر means <i>streams,</i> or <i>flows, of milk:</i> and [in like manner] one says, حَلَبَ الدَّهْرَ شَطْرَيْهِ. (TA.) And, as is said in the “ Kámil ” of Mbr, one says of a man experienced in affairs, فُلَانٌ قَدْ حَلَبَ <br>\
                  اَشْطُرَهُ (tropical:)  <i>Such a one has endured the difficulties and</i> [<i>enjoyed</i>] <i>the ampleness of fortune, and managed his affairs in poverty and in wealth:</i> lit., <i>has milked his pairs of teats,</i> one pair after another. (TA.) ―         -b6-  Also <i>A direction</i> in which one looks or goes or the like. (S, A, Msb, K.) One says, قَصَدَ شَطْرَهُ <br>\
                  <i>He went in his,</i> or <i>its, direction; towards him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (S, A.) And it is said in the Kur [ii. 139 and 144 and 145], فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ اْلْمَسْجِدِ اْلْحَرَامِ <br>\
                  <i>Then turn thou thy face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque.</i> (Fr, S.) The noun in this sense has no verb belonging to it: or one says, شَطَرَ شَطْرَهُ [expl. above: see 1]. (K.) ―         -b7-  Also <i>Distance,</i> or <i>remoteness.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
