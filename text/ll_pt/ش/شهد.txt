                  ; (K;) also pronounced and written شَهْدَ, (Akh, S, K,) and شِهْدَ, and شِهِدَ, accord. to a rule applying to all verbs of the measure فَعِلَ of which the medial radical letter is a faucial; (MF;) inf. n. شَهَادَةٌ (S, A, Mgh, L, Msb, K) and شهد; (TA;) [there written without any syll. sign, and not found by me in any other Lex.;]) <i>He told,</i> or <i>gave information of, what he had witnessed,</i> or <i>seen</i> or <i>beheld with his eye:</i> (Mgh, L, Msb:) this is the primary signification: (L:) <i>he declared what he knew: he gave testimony, attestation,</i> or <i>evidence; he bore witness:</i> (L:) <i>he gave decisive information.</i> (S, A, L, K.) [See also شَهَادَةٌ below.] You say, شَهِدَ بِكَذَا, inf. n. as above, (S, A, Mgh, L, Msb, K,) <i>He told,</i> or <i>gave information of, such a thing, as having witnessed it,</i> or <i>seen</i> or <i>beheld it with his eye;</i> (Mgh, Msb;) or <i>declared such a thing as knowing it;</i> (L;) or <i>gave his testimony, attestation,</i> or <i>evidence, respecting it;</i> or <i>bore witness of it,</i> or <i>to it;</i> (S, A, L, K;) عِنْدَ الحَاكِمِ [<i>in the presence of the judge</i>]; لِفُلَانٍ [<i>for,</i> or <i>in favour of, such a one</i>], (S, Mgh, L, K,) and عَلَى فُلَانٍ [<i>against,</i> or <i>in opposition to, such a one</i>]. (Mgh.) And شَهِدَ عَلَى <br>\

                  <i>He gave decisive information</i> [<i>respecting such a thing</i> (as in the Kur xlvi. 9, and in many other instances); <i>he testified respecting it</i>]. (S, L. [See also another meaning of this phrase in what follows.]) [Hence,] شَهِدَ اْللّٰهُ اَنَّهُ لَا اـِلَاهَ اـِلَّا هُوَ, in the Kur [iii. 16], means <i>God hath given evidence that there is no deity but He:</i> (Abu-l- &#39;Abbás, IAmb, Jel:) or <i>God knoweth</i> &amp;amp;c.; (Ah- mad Ibn-Yahyà, K;) and so شَهِدَ اْللّٰهُ throughout the Kur-án: (Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà:) or <i>God saith</i> &amp;amp;c.: or <i>God hath written</i> &amp;amp;c.

                  <i>I know,</i> (Msb, K,) [or <i>acknowledge,</i>] and <i>I declare,</i> [or <i>testify, that there is no deity but God:</i>] (K:) [Fei says,] the verb is trans. in this phrase by itself [i. e. without the intervention of a prep.] because it is used in the sense of اَعْلَمُ. (Msb.) [And hence, كَلِمَةُ الشَّهَادَةِ means <i>The sentence declaring that there is no deity but God and that Mohammad is God&#39;s apostle.</i>] ―         -b2-  شَهِدَ بِاْللّٰهِ, (Mgh, * Msb,) aor.      <br>\

                  <i>I swear by such a thing.</i> (S, K.) اَشْهَدُ بِاْللّٰهِ لَقَدْ كَانَ كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>I swear by God that such a thing happened,</i> or <i>took place,</i> combines the meaning of witnessing with that of swearing and that of informing at the time of  uttering these words; as though the speaker said, <i>I swear by God that I witnessed such a thing, and now I inform of it.</i> (Msb.) Accord. to some, when one says only اَشْهَدُ, not adding بِاْللّٰهِ, it is an oath. (TA.) ―         -b3-  شَهِدَ عَلَى كَذَا, a phrase of which one meaning has been expl. above, means also <i>He became a witness</i> (شَاهِد) <i>of,</i> or <i>to, such a thing;</i> (S, K;) <i>he had knowledge of such a thing, and witnessed it,</i> or <i>saw it</i> or <i>beheld it with his eye:</i> (Msb:) and شَهِدَهُ, (Mgh, L,) inf. n. شَهَادَةٌ, (L,) [likewise] signifies <i>he witnessed it;</i> or <i>saw,</i> or <i>beheld, it,</i> or <i>him, with his eye;</i> (Mgh, L;) and (Mgh, L, Msb) so ↓ <br>\
      شاهدهُ, (A, Mgh, L, Msb, K,) inf. n. مُشَاهَدَةٌ. (S, A, L, Msb.) [Hence,] one says, مِنْهُ حَالٌ جَمِيلَةٌ ↓ <br>\
      شُوهِدَتْ [<i>A comely,</i> or <i>pleasing, state,</i> or <i>condition, of him was witnessed</i>]. (A.) ―         -b4-  And شَهِدَهُ, (aor.      <br>\

Hence the saying, (Msb,) فَمَنْ شَهِدَ مِنْكُمُ اْلشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ, in the Kur [ii. 181], <i>Therefore whosoever of you shall be present in the month, and stationary, not journeying, he shall fast therein</i> (Mgh, Msb) as long as he shall remain present and stationary: (Msb:) الشهر being here in the accus. case as an adv. n. of time.

                  <i>I made him to have knowledge of the thing, and to witness it,</i> or <i>see it</i> or <i>behold it with his eye.</i> (Msb.)

(MF on the خُطْبَة of the K.) [One says, هٰذَا شَاهِدٌ لِكَذَا and عَلَى كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>This is an evidential example of such a thing.</i>] With respect to the classical language, absolutely, شواهد are taken, by universal consent, from the Kur-án, and from the language [both verse and prose (Kull p. 348)] of those Arabs who lived before the period of the corruption [in any considerable degree] of the Arabic tongue: [see مُوَلَّدٌ:] also, accord. to the general decision of the learned, from the Traditions of Mohammad; [which last source is excluded by some because traditions may be corrupted in language by their transmitters, and interpolated, and even forged;] and electively from the language of those Arabs who lived after the first corruption of the Arabic tongue, but before the corruption had become extensive. (Mz, 1st نوع; and MF ubi suprà. [See, again, مُوَلَّدٌ.]) The classes of the poets from whose poetry شواهد are taken are the Pagan Arabs, the Mukhadrams, the Islámees, and the Muwelleds: [see جَاهِلِىٌّ and مُخَضْرَمٌ and اـِسْلَامِىٌّ and مُوَلَّدٌ:] with respect to all the sciences above mentioned, they are taken from the poetry of the first, second, and third, classes; from that of the first and second by universal consent, and from that of the third electively: (MF ubi suprá:) but they are taken from the poetry of the fourth class with respect only to the sciences of المَعَانِى and البَيَان and البَدِيع. (Idem, and Kull p. 348.) [The age of the earliest existing classical poems (though some older fragments and couplets and single verses have been preserved) is only about a century before the birth of Mohammad: that of the latest, about a century after his death. (See the Preface to this work.)] ―         -b6-  <i>Knowing,</i> (Msb,) <i>and witnessing,</i> or <i>seeing</i> or <i>beholding with his eye; a witness,</i> as meaning <i>an eyewitness;</i> (L, Msb;) as also ↓ <br>\

(A.) ―         -b9-  [Hence, app., being opposed to غَايِبٌ,] <i>A running in which a horse exerts his force unsparingly;</i> (A, L;) as in the saying, لِلْفَرَسِ غَايِبٌ وَشَاهِدٌ <br>\

                  صَوْنٌ وَبَذْلٌ: (A: [see 1 in art. بذل:]) or شَاهِدٌ means <i>a running that testifies the excellence of a horse,</i> (IAar, K,) <i>and his quality of outstripping others.</i> (IAar, TA.) ―         -b10-  <i>A star</i> [app. <i>when visible</i>]; (Aboo-Eiyoob, K;) as being present and apparent in the night. (TA.) ―         -b11-  [Hence, accord. to some,] صَلَاةُ الشَّاهِدِ <br>\
                  <i>The prayer of sunset;</i> (A, L, Msb, K;) because it is <i>the prayer that is performed when the star becomes visible;</i> (Sh, L;) also called صَلَاةُ البَصَرِ, because the stars are seen at the time thereof: or, accord. to some, <i>the prayer of daybreak;</i> (L;) [and so, accord. to some, صَلَاةُ البَصَرِ; (see art. بصر;)] as also ↓ <br>\
      المَشْهُودُ; (TA;) and it is said to be so called because he who is travelling must perform it without abridging it, like him who is present at his home: Aboo-Sa&#39;eed Ed-Dareer says that the former prayer is so called for this reason [as is also said in the A and Msb]: AM asserts that the first reason assigned above is the right one, because the prayer of daybreak, in like manner, may not be abridged, and is not thus called; but it is thus called by a poet. (L.) ―         -b12-  And الشَّاهِدُ is a name of <i>Friday;</i> (Fr, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      المَشْهُودُ: or the latter is <i>the day of resurrection:</i> (K:) or <i>the day of &#39;Arafeh:</i> (Fr, K: [see عَرَفَةُ:]) because of the presence and congregation of people on each of those days. (TA.) ―         -b13-  شَاهِدٌ also signifies <i>Matter resembling mucus, that comes forth with the fœtus:</i> (S, K:) pl. شُهُودٌ: which latter, accord. to ISd, means the اَغْرَاس [pl. of غِرْسٌ, q. v.,] <i>upon the head of a young camel at the time of its birth.</i> (TA.) And شُهُودٌ النَّاقَةِ means <i>The marks left by the blood,</i> or <i>by the membrane that enclosed the fœtus, of the she-camel, in the place where she has brought forth.</i> (S, K.) ―         -b14-  Also A <i>quick,</i> or an <i>expeditious,</i> thing or affair.
