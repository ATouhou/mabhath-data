                  <i>A thing from which one augurs evil; an omen,</i> or <i>a bodement, of evil:</i> because it refrains one from a thing that he wants. (A, art. عطس.) ↓ <br>\

                   [<i>A bit;</i> i. e., <i>the iron appurtenances of a bridle</i>]. To the لجام belong pieces of iron which are fastened one to another; as the عِضَادَتَانِ, and the مِسْحَل, and the فَاْس and its extremities of iron. (Az, in TA, voce قَيْقَبٌ.) The above explanation is incomplete: it means the <i>bridle,</i> or <i>headstall and reins, with the bit and other appurtenances;</i> like its Persian original, لِكَامْ: see قَرَّطَ. It signifies The <i>piece of iron in the mouth of the horse:</i> thus, by extension, applied to <i>this with its thongs,</i> or <i>straps, and apparatus:</i> it comprises the شَكِيمَة, which is the transverse piece of iron in the mouth; and the فَاْس, which is the piece of iron standing up in the mouth; and the مِسْحَل, which is the iron beneath the حَنَك; and the خُطَّافَانِ, which are two bent pieces of iron in the مِسْحَل and the شكيمة, on the right and left; and the فَرَاشَتَانِ, which are two pieces of iron wherewith are fastened the extremities of the عِذَارَانِ; and the حَكَمَة, which is the ring surrounding the مَرْسَِن and the حَنَك, of silver or iron or thong.
