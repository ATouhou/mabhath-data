      لُقَطَةٌ like رُطَبَةٌ: (Msb:) or ↓ <br>\
      لُقَاطَةٌ signifies also <i>what falls,</i> or <i>drops,</i> of a thing that is worthless, (K, TA,) or paltry, <i>and is taken by any one who chooses to take it:</i> (TA:) and the same, <i>what is picked up from the stumps of the branches</i> of palm-trees, [app. meaning <i>dates picked up thence,</i>] <i>after the cutting off of the dates:</i> (TA:) IAth says, that ↓ <br>\
      لُقَطَةٌ, with damm to the ل and fet-h to the ق, is often mentioned in trads., and signifies <i>property which is found:</i> (TA:) Az says, that لُقَطَةٌ, with fet-h to the ق, signifies <i>a thing which one finds dropped,</i> or <i>thrown down, and takes;</i> (Mgh, Msb;) and that all the lexicologists and skilful grammarians say so; (Msb;) and in like  manner, A &#39;Obeyd, on the authority of As and of El-Ahmar; (TA;) only Lth, of all whom he has heard, saying that it is ↓ <br>\
      لُقْطَةٌ, with sukoon; (Mgh, Msb;) and Fr: (TA:) IF and ElFárábee and others mention only ↓ <br>\
      لُقَطَةٌ; and some reckon the pronunciation with sukoon as an error of the vulgar; and the reason is this; that the original word is ↓ <br>\
      لُقَاطَةٌ, which, in consequence of its being in frequent use, as applied to what is picked up in plundering, is contracted, sometimes, by the elision of the ة, into ↓ <br>\
      لُقَاطٌ, and sometimes, by the elision of the ا into ↓ <br>\
      لُقَطَةٌ; and if they made the ق quiescent, there would be two alterations in the word, and such double alteration does not exist in chaste language: (Msb:) IB, however, says that ↓ <br>\
      لُقْطَةٌ is correct; and he approves it; because فُعْلَةٌ has the sense of a pass. part. n., as in the instance of ضُحْكَةٌ; and فُعَلَةٌ has the sense of an act. part. n., as in the instance of ضُحَكَةٌ; and that it occurs in poetry: and IAth observes, that some say thus; but that ↓ <br>\
      لُقَطَةٌ is more common and more correct. (TA.) <i>Anything that is scattered,</i> of ears of corn, or of fruit; n. un. with ة: (TA:) <i>what is picked up,</i> or <i>taken from the ground,</i> (S, Msb, K,) by men, (S,) of ears of corn; (S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ <br>\

      لَقَاطٌ, like سَحَابٌ, the <i>ears of corn which the reaping-hooks miss,</i> (AHn, K,) <i>and which men pick up.</i> (AHn.) <i>What is picked up</i> from a mine: (Msb:) <i>pieces of gold found in a mine;</i> (K;) or such are termed لَقَطُ مَعْدِنٍ: (S:) or لَقَطٌ signifies <i>pieces of gold,</i> or <i>of silver, like what are termed</i> <br>\
