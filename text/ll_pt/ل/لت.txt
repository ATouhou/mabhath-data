                  , occurring in the Kur [liii. 19,] (TA,) so accord. to the reading of Ibn-&#39;Abbás and &#39;Ikrimeh and some others, (K,) and so originally accord. to Fr.: (TA:) afterwards contracted into اللَّاتُ: (Fr, K:) which is the common reading: (Fr:) <i>A certain idol;</i> thus called by the appellation of a man who used to moisten سَوِيق with clarified butter at the place thereof: (K:) the man who did this was thus called, and afterwards the idol itself. (TA.) Some of the lexicologists say, that it was a mass of rock, at the place whereof was a man who used to moisten سويق for the pilgrims, and which, when he died, was worshipped: (L:) but ISd says, I know not what is the truth in this case. (TA.) In the R it is said, that the man who used to do this was &#39;Amr Ibn-Lu-eí; that when the tribe of Khuzá&#39;ah obtained the dominion over Mekkeh, and banished the tribe of Jurhum, the Arabs made him a Lord, or an object of worship; and that he was El-Látt, who used to moisten سويق for the pilgrims upon a well-known rock, called صخْرَةُ اللَّاتِّ: or, it is said, that the man in question was of the tribe of Thakeef; and that when he died, &#39;Amr Ibn-Loheí (لحى: so in the TA) said to the people, “ He hath not died, but hath entered the rock: ” and ordered them to worship it, and built over it a house called اللات: it is also said to have continued thus during the life of this man and that of his son, for three hundred years: then that rock was named اللَّاتُ, without teshdeed to the ت, and was taken for an idol, to be worshipped. (TA.) It is disputed whether it were [an idol] of the tribe of Thakeef at Et-Táïf, or of the tribe of Kureysh at En-Nakhleh. (MF.) Some say, that the ت is originally without teshdeed, and to denote the fem. gender: Ks used to pronounce the word in a case of pause اللَّاهْ; and Aboo-Is-hák [Zj] says, that this is agreeable with analogy; but that the more approved mode is to pronounce it in such case with ت. AM says, that the manner in which Ks pronounced it in a case of pause shows that he did not derive it from لَتٌّ. The polytheists who worshipped this idol used to compare its name with the name of اللّٰه. It is also said, that اللَّاتُ, without teshdeed, is of the measure فَعَلَةٌ [originally اللَّوَيَةُ] from the root لوى; [and that the said idol was so called] because they used to compass it, or perform circuits round it. (TA.) [See art. لوى: and see also arts. لوه and ليه: and الرَّبَّةُ, in art رب.]   </entryFree> <br>\
