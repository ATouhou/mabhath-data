                  , aor. يَلُوتُ, <i>He told, narrated,</i> or <i>gave an account of, a thing different from that respecting which he was asked.</i> (K.) [But accord. to some, the aor. is يَلِيتُ, and the verb belongs to art. ليت.] It was said to ElAsadeeyeh, “ What is المُدَاحَلَةُ ” and she answered اَنْ يَلِيتَ الاـِنْسَانُ شَيْيًا قَدْ عَلِمَهُ, i. e., “ The concealing a thing that one knows, and telling, or narrating, something different from it. ” (TA.) ―         -b2-  لَاتَ الخَبَرَ, aor. يَلُوتُ, <i>He concealed the news,</i> or <i>information,</i> (K,) <i>and related what was different therefrom.</i> (TA.) [But see above.] ―         -b3-  لَاتَ الرَّجُلَ, aor. يَلُوتُ, <i>He told the man,</i> or <i>narrated to him, a thing in a manner different from the real state of the case:</i> or <i>he expressed the news,</i> or <i>information, to him obscurely,</i> or <i>enigmatically,</i> or <i>obscured it to him,</i> or <i>concealed it from him, telling him, narrating to him,</i> or <i>giving him an account of, a thing different from that respecting which he was asked:</i> but accord. to As., لَاتَهُ, aor. يَلِيتُهُ, [not يَلُوتُهُ.] inf. n. لَيْتٌ, signifies “ he expressed to him the news, or information, obscurely, or enigmatically, or obscured it to him, or concealed it from him ”: thus he makes it belong to art. ليت: and the like is said in the L. See also above. (TA.) ―         -b4-  لَاتَهُ, aor. يَلُوتُ; as also لَاتَهُ, aor. يَلِيتُ; <i>He withheld him,</i> or <i>restrained him, and turned him,</i> or <i>averted him, from his course, purpose,</i> or <i>object.</i> (S, K, art ليت, q. v.)    </entryFree> <br>\
