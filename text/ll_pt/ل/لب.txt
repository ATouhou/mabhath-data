<b>لَبٌّ</b>               1     <br>\
                     لَبٌّ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                   inf. n. of لَبَّ “ he remained, &amp;amp;c. ” ―         -b2-  لبَّيْكَ [<i>At thy service!</i> lit., <i>Doubly at thy service!</i>] (S, K, &amp;amp;c.) and لَبَّيْهِ [<i>At his service: &amp;amp;c.</i>]. (TA.) [See an ex. voce مَرْهُوبٌ. It is used in the present day like our phrase <i>At thy service,</i> and may well be thus rendered, or with the addition of <i>time after time.</i>] لبّيك is derived from اَلَبَّ [or rather from لَبَّ as syn. with البّ] “ he remained &amp;amp;c. ”; and means <i>I wait intent upon thy service,</i> or <i>upon obedience to thee:</i> (Fr, S, K;) <i>waiting</i> [<i>at they service</i>] <i>after waiting;</i> [i. e., <i>time after time;</i>] <i>and answering</i> [<i>thy commands</i>] <i>after answering:</i> (K:) it [i. e. the noun without the annexed pron.] is put in the acc. case as an inf. n. [used as an absolute complement of its own verb which is understood], as in حَمْدًا لِلّٰهِ وشُكْرًا; and the right way would be to say لَبًّا لَكَ; but it is put in the dual number for the sake of corroboration; meaning اـِلْبَابًا <br>\
                  بِكَ بَعْدَ اـِلْبَابٍ, and اـِقَامَةً بَعْدَ اـِقَامَةٍ, [<i>waiting at thy service,</i> or <i>in attendance upon thee,</i> or <i>in thy presence, after waiting,</i> or <i>time after time</i>]. (Fr, S.) [See also the similar expression سَعْدَيْكَ.] Or لَبٌّ signifies the <i>obeying,</i> or <i>serving;</i> or <i>obedience,</i> or <i>service;</i> from the original signification of the “ remaining, staying, abiding, or dwelling, ” [in a place]: the dual, in the nom. case, is لَبّانِ; and in the acc. and gen., لَبَّيْنِ; and the original meaning of لبيك is <i>I have obeyed thee,</i> or <i>served thee, twice:</i> [or <i>I do obey thee, &amp;amp;c.:</i>] the ن [of لبّين] being elided because of its being prefixed to the pron. (IAar.) Or لبّيك is from the saying دَارُ فُلَانٍ تَلُبُّ دَارِى “ the house of such a one faces my house ”; (Kh, S, K;) and the meaning is <i>I present myself before thee,</i> (or <i>repair to thee,</i> K,) <i>doing what thou likest, answering thee</i> [<i>after answering,</i> or <i>time after time</i>]: the ى is to form the dual number; and indicates that the noun is in the acc. case as an inf. n. [used as mentioned above]. (Kh, S.) Or it means <i>My love</i> [<i>is given</i>] <i>to thee;</i> from the expression اِمْرَاَةٌ لَبَّةٌ “ a woman loving (and affectionate, TA,) to her husband ”: so in the K: but the expression, as related on the authority of Kh, is اُمٌّ لَبَّةٌ; which is confirmed by a verse that he cites. (TA.) Or the meaning is اـِخْلَاصِى لَكَ [<i>My sincere service,</i> or <i>the like,</i> (<i>is given</i>) <i>to thee;</i>] from the expression حَسَبٌ لُبَابٌ “ pure nobility, or the like. ” (K.) Accord. to Yoo, لبّيك is a noun in the sing. number with the pron. annexed to it: this noun is originally لَبَّبٌ, of the measure فَعْلَلٌ: (not of the measure فَعَّلٌ, because this is rare in the language:) the the last ب is changed into ى to avoid the reduplication; and thus it becomes لَبَّىٌ: then the ى, being movent, and immediately preceded by fet-hah, is changed into ا; and it becomes لَبَّا [or لَبَّى, for the ى in this case is called ا]: then, being conjoined with ك in لبّيك, and with ه in لبّيه, its ا is changed into ى; after the same manner as you say اـِلَيْكَ and عَلَيْكَ and لَدَيْكَ. (TA.) [But see what here follows.] ―         -b3-  لَبَّىْ <br>\
                  يَدَيْكَ is a phrase exactly similar to لبّيك, meaning <i>At the service</i> (or, lit. <i>doubly at the service</i>) <i>of thy hands!</i> and this is said, in the S, art. لبى to be at variance with the opinion of Yoo, given above; for, if لبّى were similar to اـِلَى &amp;amp;c., being prefixed to a noun, not a pron., it would be لَبَّى يَدَيْكَ, not لَبَّىْ.] Accord. to El-Khattá- bee, لبّى يديك signifies <i>May thy hands be safe and sound!</i> the desinential syntax being disregarded in the saying يديك, which rightly should be يَدَاكَ, in order that يديك may match in sound with لبّيك: but Z says, that the meaning is, <i>I will obey thee, and be at thy free disposal, as a thing which thou shalt dispose of with thy hands in whatever manner thou shalt please.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  In like manner you say لَبَّىْ زَيْدٍ [<i>At the service</i> (or <i>doubly at the service</i>) <i>of Zeyd</i>]. (Msb.) See art. لبى. ―         -b5-  لَبِّ, with kesreh for its termination, like اَمْس and غَاقِ, is also related as having been used: (Sb:) [and it is still used in some parts, as signifying <i>At thy service!</i>].       -A2-  لَبٌّ <br>\
                  <i>keeping,</i> or <i>adhering,</i> [to a thing]: <i>remaining,</i> or <i>staying.</i> (K.) ―         -b2-  <i>A camel-driver who keeps constantly to the work of driving the camels, not leaving them.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  رَجُلٌ لَبٌّ <br>\
