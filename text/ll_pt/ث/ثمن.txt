                   The <i>price</i> of a thing; i. e. the <i>thing that the seller receives in return for the thing sold, whether money</i> or <i>a commodity;</i> (Er-Rághib, TA;) the ثَمَن of a thing sold: (S:) and also (Er-Rághib, TA) <i>a compensation,</i> or <i>substitute,</i> (Mgh, Msb, Er-Rághib, TA,) <i>whatever it be, for a thing,</i> (Er-Rághib, TA,) i. e., <i>for a thing that is sold;</i> but in the sense commonly known, <i>such as it is incumbent upon one to pay, of pieces of silver, and of gold</i> [<i>or other money</i>]; <i>not commodities and the like:</i> (Mgh:) or the <i>value,</i> or <i>worth,</i> of a thing; (K;) its قِيمَة: (T:) or the <i>estimated value,</i> or <i>worth,</i> of a thing, <i>by mutual consent, even though it be really excessive or deficient;</i> whereas the قِيمَة is its real value or worth, its equivalent: (MF:) pl. اَثْمَانٌ (T, Mgh, Msb, K) and اَثْمُنٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the latter used only as a pl. of pauc., (Msb,) and [so] اَثْمِنَةٌ. (CK: not in the TA.) The saying in the Kur [ii. 38 and v. 48], وَلَا تَشْتَرُوا بِا=يَاتِى ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا is metaphorical, meaning (tropical:)  <i>And take ye not in exchange for my signs a small substitute:</i> [i. e. purchase not in exchange for belief in my word the happiness, or enjoyments, of the present life.] (Mgh.) With respect to this saying, Fr remarks, when ثَمَنًا occurs in the Kur, with بِ prefixed to the name of the thing sold or bought, in most cases it relates to two things whereof neither is a ثمن in the sense commonly known, i. e., such as pieces of gold and of silver: and such is the case when you say, اِشْتَرَيْتُ ثَوْبًا بِكِسَا=ءٍ [<i>I purchased a garment with a</i> <br>\
                  كساء, q. v.]: either of these may be termed a ثمن for the other: but in speaking of pieces of silver and of gold, you prefix the ب to the ثمن [only]; as is done in [the chapter of] Yoosuf, [i. e. ch. xii., v. 20, where it is said,] وَشَرَوْهُ بِثَمَنٍ بَخْسٍ دَرَاهِمَ مَعْدُودَةٍ [<i>And they sold him for a deficient,</i> or <i>an insufficient, price: for pieces of silver</i> not many, so as to require their being weighed, but few, and therefore <i>counted</i>]: for pieces of silver are always a ثمن: and when you purchase pieces of silver and of gold with the like, you prefix the ب to whichever of the two you will, because each of them in this case is a purchase and a price.

                   a noun of number, well known; [meaning <i>Eight;</i>] as also ↓ <br>\
      ثَمَانٍ, (M, TA,) which is like يَمَانٍ, (M, K,) in form: (M:) the former is the masc. form: the latter, the fem.: (Msb:) this is not a rel. n. [though likened above to يَمَانٍ]: (M, K:) or it is originally a rel. n. from الثُّمُنُ, because it is the part, or portion, that makes seven to be eight, so that it is its eighth: they make the first letter to be pronounced with fet-h, because they make changes [in some other cases] in the rel. n., (S, K,) as when they say سُهْلِىٌّ and دُهْرِىٌّ, [which are rel. ns. of سَهْلٌ and دَهْرٌ,] (S,) and they suppress one of the two ى which are characteristic of the rel. n., and compensate it by the insertion of ا, as they do in the rel. n. of اليَمَنُ [when they say يَمَانٍ, originally يَمَانِىٌ, for يَمَنِىٌّ]: (S, K: [and the like is said in the Mgh:]) El-Fárisee says that the ا of ثَمَانٍ is the characteristic of the rel. n., because this word is not a broken pl. like صَحَارٍ; and IF assents to this, and says that were it not so, the ة would be inseparable, as it is in عَبَاقِيَةٌ &amp;amp;c. (M.) You say ثَمَانِيَةُ رِجَالٍ [<i>Eight men</i>], (T, S, Mgh,) and ثَمَانِيَةُ اَيَّامٍ [<i>eight days</i>]. (Msb.) And when ثمان is prefixed to another noun, its ى is retained, like the ى in القَاضِى: (S, Msb, K:) and it is decl. in the same manner as words of the class to which this last belongs: (Msb:) you say ثَمَانِى نِسْوَةٍ [<i>Eight women</i>], (T, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and ثَمَانِى <br>\
                  مِايَةٍ [<i>eight hundred</i>], (S, Msb, K,) [in the nom. and gen. cases;] and رَاَيْتُ ثَمَانِىَ نِسْوَةٍ [<i>I saw eight women</i>], pronouncing the fet-hah [at the end, in this case]. (Msb.) When it is with tenween, the ى is dropped in the nom. and gen. cases, but it is retained in the accus. case: (S, K:) [i. e.,] when the fem. form is not prefixed to another noun, you say, عِنْدِى مِنَ النِّسَا=ءِ ثَمَانٍ [<i>I have with me, of women, eight</i>], <i>and</i> <br>\
                  مَرَرْتُ <br>\
                  مِنْهُنَّ بِثَمَانٍ [<i>I passed by, of them, eight</i>], and رَاَيْتُ ثَمَانِيًا [<i>I saw eight</i>]. (Msb.) It sometimes occurs, in poetry, indecl.: (S, M:) this is because it is fancied to be a pl.; (S;) or because it is likened, as to the letter, but not as to the meaning, to جَوَارِىَ. (M.) The people of El-Hijáz pronounce the masc. and the fem. with nasb in every case, in phrases like اَتَوْنِى ثَلَاثَتَهُمْ and اَتَيْنَنِى ثَلَاثَهُنَّ; and so on to ten [inclusive]. (S voce ثَلَاثَةٌ, q. v.) Th mentions ↓ <br>\
      ثَمَانٌ; (TA;) and some instances of its occurrence are cited; but As disallows it. (T, Mgh, TA.) كِسَا=ءٌ ذُو <br>\
                  ثَمَانٍ means <i>A</i> [<i>garment of the kind called</i>] كساء <br>\
                  <i>made of eight fleeces.</i> (T.) تُقْبِلُ بِاَرْبَعٍ وَتُدْبِرُ <br>\
                  بِثَمَانٍ [<i>She advances with four and goes back with eight</i>] is a saying of one of the مُخَنَّثُون of El-Medeeneh; meaning, with four creases (عُكَن) of the belly, and with eight extremities thereof; each crease having two extremities, towards the two sides of the woman spoken of. (Mgh in art. هيت.) The saying الثَّوْبُ سَبْعٌ فِى ثَمَانٍ should properly be فِى ثَمَانِيَةٍ, (S,) which means, <i>The garment,</i> or <i>piece of cloth, is seven</i> cubits in length <i>by eight</i> spans in breadth; (Msb;) because the length is measured by the ذِرَاع, which is fem., and the breadth by the شِبْر, which is masc.; but they use the fem. when they do not mention things; as when they say, صُمْنَا مِنَ الشَّهْرِ خَمْسًا [We fasted, of the month, five], though meaning days: (S:) or because ذراع is fem. in most instances, and شبر is masc. (Msb.) [But it is said that when ثمانية means the things numbered, not the amount of the number, it is imperfectly decl., being regarded as a proper name: thus] you say, تِسْعَةُ اَكْثَرُ مِنْ ثَمَانِيَةَ [<i>Nine things are more than eight things</i>]. (TA voce تِسْعَةٌ, q. v.) [See also سِتَّةٌ.] ―         -b2-  When you make it a compound [with the number ten], you say, عِنْدَى ثَمَانِيَةَ عَشَرَ رَجُلًا [<i>I have with me eighteen men</i>]: and in the case of the fem., you may either make the ى to be with fet-h or make it quiescent, saying, عِنْدِى <br>\
                  مِنَ النِّسَا=ءِ ثَمَانِىَ عَشْرَةَ اْمْرَاَةً or ثَمَانِىْعَشْرَةَ [<i>I have with me, of women, eighteen women</i>]; but the former is the more chaste; and in one dial., the ى is elided, on the condition of [saying ثَمَانَ <br>\
                  عَشْرَةَ,] making the ن to be with fet-h; (Msb;) or in this case you say ثَمَانِ عَشْرَةَ, with kesr. (T.) A poet says, (T, S,) namely, El-Aashà, (K,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

      ثُمَيْنِيَةٌ, or by suppressing the ى, saying ↓ <br>\
      ثُمَيِّنَةٌ, changing the ا into ى and incorporating into it the ى that is the characteristic of the dim.; and you may compensate for both [of these suppressed letters by saying ↓ <br>\
      ثُمَيْنِيَّةٌ and ↓ <br>\
      ثُمَيِّينَةٌ]. (S.) ―         -b4-  الثَّمَانِى is also the name of <i>A certain plant.</i> (As, T, K.)    </entryFree> <br>\
