                  ثَدْىٌ: (TA:) and the <i>pap,</i> or <i>mamilla, of a woman</i> and <i>of a man:</i> (KL:) accord. to the author of the Wá&#39;ee, the pl. [of تندوة] is ثَنَادِهُ, [with ه substituted for ء, unless the former be a mistranscription for the latter,] (TA,) and [that of ثندوة is] ثَنَادٍ. (Msb, TA.) The word ثدى is used in relation to men in the Saheeh of Muslim, and ثندوة in relation to women in the Sunan of Aboo-Dáwood; and many of the lexicologists incline to the opinion that ثدى is common to men and women.
