                   and ↓ <br>\
      اَثَطُّ, (Lth, S, K,) but the former is the more correct and the more common, (Lth,) or the former only, (IDrd, and IB on the authority of Ibn-El-Jawáleekee, and K,) the latter being vulgar, (IDrd, K,) but AZ asserted his having heard the latter, (AHát, cited in the Jm,) [and the latter only is mentioned in the Mgh,] A man (S, Mgh) <i>having no hair upon the sides of his face, but only upon his chin;</i> syn. كَوْسَجٌ: (S, Mgh, K:) or <i>having a scanty beard:</i> (IDrd:) or the former signifies <i>having little hair in the beard,</i> and <i>in the eyebrows:</i> (K:) or [when you mean the latter] you say رَجُلٌ ثَطُّ الحَاجِبَيْنِ, (K,) <i>a man having thin,</i> or <i>scanty, eyebrows;</i> as also الحَاجِبَيْنِ ↓ <br>\
      اَثَطُّ; (TA;) the mention of the eyebrows being indispensable; (IAar, K;) and اِمْرَاَةٌ <br>\
                  ثَطَّةُ الحَاجِبَيْنِ [<i>a woman having thin,</i> or <i>scanty, eyebrows</i>]: (S TA:) pl. (of pauc., TA) اَثْطَاطٌ (Kr, K) and (of mult., TA) ثُطَّانٌ and ثِطَطَةٌ (AZ, K) and ثُطُطٌ, (IAar,) [all of which may be of either sing.,] and ثِطَاطٌ, (AZ, S, K,) which is of the former sing., (S,) and ثُطٌّ, (AZ, S, K,) which is of the latter. (S.) You say also اِمْرَاَةٌ ↓ <br>\
      ثَطَّا=ءُ <br>\
                  <i>A woman having no</i> <br>\
                  اـِسْب, (Lth, TA,) i. e. <i>hair on the pubes;</i> in the copies of the K incorrectly written اِسْت. (TA.) And ↓ <br>\
      عَارِضٌ اَثَطُّ <br>\
                  <i>A side of the cheek,</i> or <i>of the face, having the hair falling off.</i> (Mgh.) ―         -b2-  Also, the former, <i>Heavy in the belly;</i> (K, TA;) <i>slow;</i> applied to a man. (TA.)       -A2-  The former also signifies <i>Human excrement</i> or <i>ordure;</i> or <i>thin human excrement</i> or <i>ordure;</i> syn. سَلْحٌ. (Sgh, K.) [See also ثَلْطٌ.]    </entryFree> <br>\

                  , and its fem. ثَطَّا=ءُ: see ثَطٌّ, in four places. ―         -b2-  الثَّطَّا=ءُ also signifies <i>The spider:</i> or <i>another</i> <br>\
                  <i>creeping thing, that stings,</i> or <i>bites, vehemently:</i> (K:) this is from Lth, as in the O and L: but in the Tekmileh we find الثَّطَّا=ءُ, like شَفَّا=ء, [app. a mistake for الثِّطَا=ءُ, like شِفَا=ء,] <i>a certain small creeping thing:</i> or, as some say, it is الثَّطَا, of the measure of قَفًا.
