(TA in the present art.) It is mentioned in the present art. by Sgh; (K in art. اثا;) and this is its proper place; (TA in the present art.;) the verb, accord. to him, being like اَقَامَ: (TA in art. اثا:) A &#39;Obeyd has mentioned it in art. اثا, (K in that art.,) as also Az; holding the verb to be like صَنَعَ; and so IKtt and IKoot assert it to be.
