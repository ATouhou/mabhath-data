                  , (&#39;Eyn, T, M, K,) like عُنِىBَ, (K,) and ثَيِبَ, (IKoot, L, and so in a copy of the A,) inf. n. ثَاْبٌ, (K,) or ثَاَبٌ, (M,) <i>He became relaxed and sluggish;</i> said of a man: (A:) or <i>he became affected with sluggishness and languor;</i> (M;) as also ↓ <br>\
      تثا=ءب: (M, A:) or <i>he became affected with sluggishness and languor like the languor of drowsiness;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      تثا=ءب and ↓ <br>\
      تثاّب; (K;) which last is approved by IDrd and Thábit Es-Sara- kustee, who disallow ↓ <br>\
      تثا=ءب, though this is the form commonly known and approved, and is the most chaste form: (TA:) <i>or he became affected with languor like the heaviness of drowsiness, in consequence of something that he had eaten or drunk, without becoming insensible;</i> (T;) as also ↓ <br>\
      تثا=ءب: (L:) or ↓ this last signifies <i>he yawned,</i> or <i>opened his mouth,</i> (Mgh, Msb,) <i>by reason,</i> (Mgh,) or <i>on the occasion,</i> (Msb,) <i>of languor</i> (Mgh, Msb,) <i>like the heaviness of drowsiness;</i> (Mgh;) or <i>he yawned,</i> or <i>opened his mouth, and stretched himself, on being affected by sluggishness</i> or <i>drowsiness</i> or <i>anxiety;</i> (MF, TA, on the authority of IDrst;) or <i>he yawned,</i> or <i>opened his mouth, and emitted wind from his stomach, by reason of some affection thereof:</i> (TA on the authority of EtTedmuree:) التَّثَاوُبُ is from الثُّوَبَا=ءُ; (AZ, T, S, Mgh;) and is on the occasion of one&#39;s stretching himself, and being languid: (Lth, T:) one should not say تَثَاوَبَ; (AZ, T, S, O, Mgh;) [for] this is vulgar. (Msb.) Hence, اَحَدُكُمْ فَلْيُغَطِّ ↓ <br>\
      اـِذَا تَثَاَءَبَ <br>\
                  فَاهُ [<i>When any one of you yawns, he should cover his mouth</i> with the back of his left hand; for it is believed that the devil leaps into the uncovered yawning mouth]. (Mgh.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  , (T, S, M, K, &amp;amp;c.,) as also ثُوْبَا=ء, accord. to Ibn-Mis-hal, but this is strange, (TA,) is a subst. derived from التَّثَاوُبُ, like مُطُوَا=ءُ from التَّمَطِّى; (T;) or from ثَيِبَ; and means <i>A state of relaxation and sluggishness:</i> (A:) or <i>sluggishness and languor</i> (M, K) <i>like the languor of drowsiness:</i> (K:) or <i>languor like the heaviness of drowsiness, in consequence of something that one has eaten or drunk, not attended by insensibility:</i> (T, L:) or <i>a yawning,</i> or <i>opening the mouth, by reason of languor like the heaviness of drowsiness:</i> (Mgh:) or <i>a yawning,</i> or <i>opening the mouth, and stretching oneself, on being affected by sluggishness or drowsiness or anxiety:</i> (IDrst, MF, TA:) or <i>a yawning,</i> or <i>opening the mouth, and emitting wind from the stomach, by reason of some affection thereof.</i> (Et-Tedmuree, TA.) Hence the prov., اَعْدَى مِنَ الثُّوَبَا=ءِ, (S, A, TA,) and [الثُّوَبَا=ءِ,] without ء, as some say; (MF;) or the pronunciation without ء  is vulgar, (IDrst, TA,) or erroneous; (TA;) [<i>More catching than yawning;</i>] for when a man yawns ( اذا تثاءب ) in the presence of others, they become affected as he is.
