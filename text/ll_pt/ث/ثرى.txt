      ثَرْيَا=ءُ [an epithet used as a subst.]: (AO, T, * K, TA: [in the CK, erroneously, ثَرَياء:]) and <i>the earth;</i>; (M, K) مَا تَحْتَ الثَّرَي, in the Kur [xx. 5], being explained as meaning <i>what is beneath the earth:</i> (M:) الثَّرَى and * اَثْرَى both signify <i>the earth;</i> and the latter, being thus used as a proper name, is imperfectly decl.: (Ham p. 351:) dual ثَرَيَانِ (S, M, K) and ثَرَوَانِ: (Lh, M, K: [but the sing. of the latter should be written ثَرًا:]) pl. اَثْرَا=ْ. (M, K.) اِلْتَقَى الثَّرَيَانِ [<i>The two moistures met,</i> or <i>have met,</i>] is said when the rain has sunk into the ground so that it has met the moisture of the earth. (S, M, K.) Accord. to IAar, it was also said by a man, (M,) or by an Arab of the desert, (K,) who, (M, K,) being naked, (K,) clad himself with a fur-garment, (M, K,) without a shirt; (M;) meaning <i>the hair of the pubes and the soft hair of the fur-garment.</i> (M, K.) And the Arabs say, شَهْرٌ ثَرَى وَشَهْرٌ تَرَى وَشَهْرٌ مَرْعَى وَشَهْرٌ اْسْتَوَى, meaning <i>A month</i> [<i>of moisture</i>] <i>in which the rain begins, and sinks into the ground, and moistens and softens the earth;</i> for شَهْرٌ ذُو ثَرًى: <i>and a month in which thou seest the heads of the herbage grown forth;</i> for شَهْرٌ تَرَى فِيهِ رُوُوسَ النَّبَاتِ: <i>and a month in which the herbage</i> is <i>tall enough to be pastured upon by the cattle:</i> (As, S, * M:) <i>and a month in which it is full-grown and erect.</i> (As, M.) One says also, بَدَا ثَرَى المَا=ءِ مِنَ الفَرَسِ, meaning <i>The sweat of the horse appeared.</i> (S, * M.) And اـِنِّى لَاَرَي ثَرَى الغَضَبِ فِى وَجْهِ فُلَانٍ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Verily I see the effect of anger in the face of such a one.</i> (T.) And هُوَاْبْنُ ثَرَاهَا (assumed tropical:)  <i>He is the knowing with respect to it.</i> (T in art. بنى.) ―         -b2-  [Hence, as being likened to moist earth,] <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  خَيْرٌ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Good; anything good;</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (M, K. [For خَيْر, Golius appears to have found, in a copy of the K, حَيْز; and this, which he has rendered “Terræ tractus,” he has given as a signification, not of ثَرًى, but of ثَرَا=ءٌ, which, like ثَرًى, he also explains as meaning “ terra. ” ]) So in the saying, فُلَانٌ قَرِيبُ الثَّرَى [app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Such a one is a person from whom good is easy of attainment:</i> or it may mean, <i>a person from whom good seems to be easy of attainment:</i> in either case likened to land of which the moist earth is near the surface: that the phrase may have the latter meaning appears from what here follows]. (M.) You say, اـِنَّ فُلَانًا لَقَرِيبُ الثَّرِى بَعِيدُ النَّبَطِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Verily such a one is a person who promises but who does not fulfil.</i> (IAar, T.) ―         -b3-  [Hence also, (assumed tropical:)  <i>Fresh and vigorous friendship.</i>] You say, لَمْ يَبْبَسِ الثَّرَى بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>The fresh and vigorous friendship between me and him has not withered</i>]: whence the phrase, مَا بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَ فُلَانٍ * مُثْرٍ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>That</i> friendship <i>which is between me and such a one is fresh and vigorous</i>]; i. e., it has not ceased, or become severed.
