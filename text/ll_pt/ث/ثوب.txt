                  على الفلاح;] i. e. the اقامة <br>\
                  <i>of prayer:</i> (IAth, TA:) and this is what is meant by the phrase, in a trad., اـِذَا ثُوِّبَ بِالصَّلَاةِ [<i>When the words of the</i> <br>\
                  اقامة <br>\
                  <i>are chanted</i>]. (IAth, Mgh, TA.) And The <i>praying after the prayer divinely ordained.</i> (Yoo, T, K.) You say, ثوّب, meaning <i>He performed a supererogatory prayer after the prescribed;</i> <br>\
                  تثويب being only after the prescribed; being the <i>praying after praying:</i> (T:) and ↓ <br>\
      تثوّب signifies the same. (K.) And ثّوب بِرَكْعَتَيْنِ <br>\
                  <i>He performed two rek&#39;ahs as a supererogatory act.</i> (A.) But this and the similar significations are said to be post-classical.

      تَثَيَّبَتْ; (K in art. ثيب; [the author of which seems to have supposed that, for ثَيَّبَتْ, one should read ثُيِّبَتْ; and therefore he gives مُثَيَّبٌ as syn. with ثَيِّبٌ;]) <i>She</i> (a woman) <i>became what</i> <br>\
