      تثا=ءب, though this is the form commonly known and approved, and is the most chaste form: (TA:) &lt;i&gt;or he became affected with languor like the heaviness of drowsiness, in consequence of something that he had eaten or drunk, without becoming insensible;&lt;/i&gt; (T;) as also ↓ <br>\
      تثا=ءب: (L:) or ↓ this last signifies &lt;i&gt;he yawned,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;opened his mouth,&lt;/i&gt; (Mgh, Msb,) &lt;i&gt;by reason,&lt;/i&gt; (Mgh,) or &lt;i&gt;on the occasion,&lt;/i&gt; (Msb,) &lt;i&gt;of languor&lt;/i&gt; (Mgh, Msb,) &lt;i&gt;like the heaviness of drowsiness;&lt;/i&gt; (Mgh;) or &lt;i&gt;he yawned,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;opened his mouth, and stretched himself, on being affected by sluggishness&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;drowsiness&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;anxiety;&lt;/i&gt; (MF, TA, on the authority of IDrst;) or &lt;i&gt;he yawned,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;opened his mouth, and emitted wind from his stomach, by reason of some affection thereof:&lt;/i&gt; (TA on the authority of EtTedmuree:) التَّثَاوُبُ is from الثُّوَبَا=ءُ; (AZ, T, S, Mgh;) and is on the occasion of one&#39;s stretching himself, and being languid: (Lth, T:) one should not say تَثَاوَبَ; (AZ, T, S, O, Mgh;) [for] this is vulgar.

                  &lt;/form&gt;, (T, S, M, K, &amp;amp;c.,) as also ثُوْبَا=ء, accord. to Ibn-Mis-hal, but this is strange, (TA,) is a subst. derived from التَّثَاوُبُ, like مُطُوَا=ءُ from التَّمَطِّى; (T;) or from ثَيِبَ; and means &lt;i&gt;A state of relaxation and sluggishness:&lt;/i&gt; (A:) or &lt;i&gt;sluggishness and languor&lt;/i&gt; (M, K) &lt;i&gt;like the languor of drowsiness:&lt;/i&gt; (K:) or &lt;i&gt;languor like the heaviness of drowsiness, in consequence of something that one has eaten or drunk, not attended by insensibility:&lt;/i&gt; (T, L:) or &lt;i&gt;a yawning,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;opening the mouth, by reason of languor like the heaviness of drowsiness:&lt;/i&gt; (Mgh:) or &lt;i&gt;a yawning,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;opening the mouth, and stretching oneself, on being affected by sluggishness or drowsiness or anxiety:&lt;/i&gt; (IDrst, MF, TA:) or &lt;i&gt;a yawning,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;opening the mouth, and emitting wind from the stomach, by reason of some affection thereof.&lt;/i&gt; (Et-Tedmuree, TA.) Hence the prov., اَعْدَى مِنَ الثُّوَبَا=ءِ, (S, A, TA,) and [الثُّوَبَا=ءِ,] without ء, as some say; (MF;) or the pronunciation without ء  is vulgar, (IDrst, TA,) or erroneous; (TA;) [&lt;i&gt;More catching than yawning;&lt;/i&gt;] for when a man yawns ( اذا تثاءب ) in the presence of others, they become affected as he is.
