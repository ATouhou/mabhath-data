      ثُبْنَةٌ signifies only <i>what one carries before him, that is little in quantity:</i> and what is great is not called ثِبَانٌ. (T.)

                  عُصْبَة: (M, K: [in the CK, العَصَبَةُ is erroneously put for العُصْبَةُ:]) the pl. is ثُبَاتٌ and ثُبُونَ (T, S, M, K) and ثِبُونَ (S, M) and (the pl. of اُثْبِيَّةٌ, TA) اَثَابِىُّ and اَثَابِيَةٌ, in which last the ة is a substitute for the last ى [of اَثَابِىُّ]: (M, TA:) or [accord. to some,] اَثَابِىُّ, which signifies <i>companies,</i> has no sing.; but, as some say, its sing. is ↓ <br>\
      اَثْبِيَّةٌ, of the measure اُفْعُولَةٌ, [originally اُثْبُويَةٌ,] which means  <i>a numerous company:</i> (Ham p. 796:) [it is also said that] ثُبًى is  a pl. of ثُبَةٌ as meaning <i>a company;</i> (L in art. ثوب, and Ham p. 271;) and hence the phrase الثُّبَى العَالِى, for الثُّبَى العَالِيَةُ, [<i>the high,</i> or <i>exalted, companies,</i>] the former word being made masc. because it is like زُلَمٌ [which is sing. and masc.]; but some say that this word here means <i>the assemblies of the nobles:</i> (Ham ubi suprá:) IAar says, الثُّبَى العَالِى مِنْ مَجَالِسِ الاَشْرَافِ; but [ISd observes,] this is extraordinary, and I have not heard it except in the poetry of El-Find EzZimmánee. (M.) Accord. to some, it is from ثَابَ, being originally ثُوبَةٌ; and its dim. is ثُوَيْبَةٌ: (T:) or it is originally ثُبَىٌ: (S:) accord. to Er-Rághib, the letter elided from ثُبَةٌ as meaning “ a company, ” but not as relating to a wateringtrough or tank, is ى; and ISd holds it to be ى: and [if so,] its dim. is ↓ <br>\
      ثُبَيَّةٌ: (TA:) [but ISd adds,] IJ says that the elided letter is و, because it is this in most cases, as in اَبٌ and اَخٌ and سَنَةٌ and عِضَةٌ &amp;amp;c. (M in arts. ثبو and ثبى.) [See also art. ثوب. It seems to signify also <i>An assemblage,</i> or <i>a collection,</i> of things of any kind:] see 2, in two places. ―         -b2-  Also The <i>middle</i> of a wateringtrough or tank, (T, S, M, K,) <i>to which the water returns</i> [<i>when it has been emptied</i>], (S,) or <i>to which what remains of the water returns:</i> (T:) and the place where the water collects in a valley or <i>low ground:</i> (Aboo-Kheyreh, T:) but this is from ثَابَ; (T, S; *) the ة is a substitute for the و, the medial radical, which is suppressed; for it is originally ثُوَبٌ: (S:) or it is originally ثُوبَةٌ: (T:) or it may be from ثَبَّيْتُ “ I collected: ” but Aboo-Is-hák makes it to be from ثَابَ المَا=ءُ, aor. يَثُوبُ; and this he infers to be the case from their saying that the dim. is ثُوَيْبَةٌ.
