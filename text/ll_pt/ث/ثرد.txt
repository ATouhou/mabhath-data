(TA.) The pl. of ثريدة is ثَرَايِدُ and ثُرُدٌ and ثُرْدٌ; (A, and Ham p. 524;) the last of which is a contraction of that next preceding it. (Ham ubi suprà.)

                  ثَرِيد, <i>the throat refuses, after</i> swallowing <i>thee, to rest,</i> by reason of desire for more]: he says that the poet calls the bread after two young men, or slaves, who were preparing ثريد, and gives tenween to يثردان by a poetic license, instead of saying يَثْرُدَانِ, which, as it is [originally] a verbal phrase, he should have said by rule: but the word, as Fr relates it, is ↓ <br>\
      اُثْرُدَانٍ; and [ISd says,] I think that this is a determinate subst., for الثَّرِيد or المَثْرُود, and therefore properly imperfectly decl., but here made perfectly decl. by a poetic license. (M.) It is said in a trad. that the excellence of &#39;Áïsheh above other women is as the excellence of ثريد above other kinds of food; but it is said that what is here meant is food prepared with flesh-meat, together with ثريد, because this is generally prepared with flesh-meat, and it is said to be one of the two things called لَحْم.
