(T.) ―         -b3-  Also <i>He tied it;</i> or <i>tied it in a knot</i> or <i>knots;</i> or <i>tied it firmly, fast,</i> or <i>strongly.</i> (TA.) You say, ثَنَيْتُ البَعِيرَ بِثِنَايَيْنِ, meaning, accord. to As, as related by A&#39;Obeyd, <i>I bound both the fore legs of the camel with two bonds:</i> but correctly, <i>I bound the two fore legs of the camel with the two ends of a rope;</i> the last word meaning a single rope: (T:) عَقَلْتُهُ بِثَنْيَيْنِ means <i>I bound one of his fore shanks to the arm with two ties,</i> or <i>tyings.</i> (T, M.) ―         -b4-  ثَنْىٌ [as inf. n. of ثَنَى] also signifies The act of <i>drawing,</i> or <i>joining,</i> or <i>adjoining, one</i> [<i>thing</i>] <i>to another;</i> (Lth, T, Mgh;) and so ↓ <br>\

      تَثْنِيَةٌ [inf. n. of ثنّى] and ثُنُيَانٌ [app. another inf. n. of ثَنَى, and app. correctly written ثُنْيَانٌ] are often used by [the Imám] Mohammad in the sense of ثَنْىٌ: he who explains تَثْنِيَةٌ as signifying the <i>turning over</i> [the land, or ground,] <i>for sowing,</i> or <i>cultivating, after the harvest,</i> or as signifying the <i>restoring land to its owner turned over for sowing,</i> or <i>cultivating,</i> commits an inadvertence. (Mgh.) ―         -b8-  فَاْثْنِنِى, occurring in a poem of Kutheiyir &#39;Azzeh, is explained as meaning <i>Then give thou to me a second time:</i> (M, TA:) but this is strange: (TA:) [ISd says,] I have not seen it in any other instance.

(TA.) الثنين in يوم الثنين has no dim. (Sb, S in art. امس.) IJ says that the article ال in الثنين is not redundant, though the word is not an epithet: Abu-l-&#39;Abbás says that the prefixing of the article in this case is allowable because the virtual meaning is اليَوْمُ الثَّانِى [<i>the second day</i>]. (M.) The saying اليَوْمُ الاِْثْنَانِ means The name of <i>to-day</i> [<i>is</i> <br>\
                  الاثنان]; and is like the saying اليَوْمُ يَوْمَانِ [to-day is two days] and اليَوْمُ خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ مِنَ الشَّهْرِ [to-day is fifteen of the month]. (Sb, M.) Sometimes, يَوْمُ اْثْنَيْنِ, without the article ال, occurs in poetry. (M, K.) When a pronoun refers to الاثنان [as meaning Monday], this word may be treated in two ways, [as a sing. and as a dual,] but the more chaste way is to treat it as a sing., as meaning the day: (Msb:) [thus,] Aboo-Ziyád used to say, مَضَى الاِْثْنَانِ بِمَا فِيهِ [<i>Monday passed with what</i> occurred <i>in it</i>]; making it sing. and masc.; and thus he did in the case of every day of the week, except that he made الجُمْعَة fem.: Abu-I-Jarráh used to say, مَضَى الاِْثْنَانِ بِمَا فِيهِمَا, treating the word as a numeral; and thus he treated the third and fourth and fifth days, saying in each of these cases بِمَا فِيهِنَّ.
