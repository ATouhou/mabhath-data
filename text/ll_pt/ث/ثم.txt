                  <i>There;</i> syn. هُنَاكَ; (Zj, S, M, K;) a noun of indication, (Zj, T, M, Msb, Mughnee, K,) denoting a place that is remote (Zj, T, S, M, Mughnee, K) from the speaker, (Zj, T, M,) like as هُنَا denotes that which is near; (Zj, T, S;) or denoting a place other than that of the speaker: (Msb:) it is an adverbial noun, not to be used otherwise  than as such; (Mughnee, K;) indecl. because of its vagueness, and with fet-h for its termination to avoid the concurrence of two quiescent letters. (Zj, T, M.) Thus in the saying [in the Kur xxvi. 64], وَاَزْلَفْنَا ثَمَّ الا=خَرِينَ [<i>And we brought near, there, the others</i>]. (Mughnee.) He who makes it decl. as an objective complement (Mughnee, K) in this ex., (Mughnee,) and in the saying in the Kur [lxxvi. 20], وَاـِذَا رَاَيْتَ ثَمَّ رَاَيْتَ نَعِيمًا, is in error: (Mughnee, K: *) Zj says that the meaning is, <i>And when thou castest thine eyes,</i> or <i>thy sight, there, thou shalt behold</i> [scenes of] <i>enjoyment:</i> that Fr asserted the meaning to be, اـِذَا رَاَيْتَ مَا ثَمَّ [<i>when thou seest what is there</i>]; but that this is an error; for ما, accord. to this interpretation, is a conjunct noun, and it is not allowable to suppress a conjunct noun and leave its complement.

                  , (T, S, M, &amp;amp;c.,) for which one also says فُمَّ, (M, Mughnee,) substituting ف for the ث, (M,) and ثُمَّتَ (T, S, M) and ثُمَّتْ, (M, TA,) but ثُمَّتَ is the more common, (Mughnee and K on the letter ت,) and فُمَّتَ and فُمَّتْ, (M, TA,) [meaning <i>Then,</i> i. e., <i>afterward,</i> or <i>afterwards,</i>] a particle, (M, K,) or conjunction, (Zj, T, S, Msb, Mughnee,) denoting order (Zj, T, S, M, Msb, Mughnee) and a delay, (S, Msb,) or having three properties, namely, that of virtually associating in the same case [the latter of the two members which it conjoins with the former of them], and denoting order, and denoting a delay; but respecting all of these there is a difference of opinions. (Mughnee, K. *) As to the associating in the same case, Akh and the Koofees assert that it sometimes fails to have this property, by its occurring redundantly, so as not to be a conjunction at all; and they hold to accord with this assertion the saying in the Kur [ix. 119], حَتَّى اـِذَا ضَاقَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ اْلْاَرْضُ بِمَا رَحُبَتْ وَضَاقَتْ <br>\
                  عَلَيْهِمْ اَنْفُسُهُمْ وَظَنُّوا اَنْ لَا مَلْجَاَ مِنَ اْللّٰهِ اـِلَّا اـِلَيْهِ ثُمَّ <br>\
                  تَابَ عَلَيْهِمْ [<i>Until, when the earth became strait to them, notwithstanding its amplitude, and their minds became straitened to them, and they knew that there was no repairing for refuge from God save unto Him, then He returned to forgiveness towards them</i>]: (Mughnee, K: *) but this has been resolved by the subaudition of the complement [of what precedes ثُمَّ, as though the meaning were, <i>then</i> (<i>they betook themselves unto Him, begging forgiveness, and</i>) <i>He returned</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (Mughnee.) And as to its denoting order, some hold that there are exs. of its not necessarily implying this; (Mughnee, K; *) one of which is the saying in the Kur [xxxix. 8], خَلَقَكُمْ مِنْ نَفْسٍ <br>\
                  وَاحِدَةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا: (Mughnee: [in which are added other similar exs., one of which is given in the K:]) but to this there are five replies: 1st, that this passage is elliptical; the meaning being, <i>He created you from one person</i> (<i>which He originated</i>); <i>then He made therefrom its mate:</i> 2nd, that the meaning is, <i>He created you from a person that was alone; then</i> &amp;amp;c.: 3rd, that the progeny of Adam were made to come forth from his back like little ants; then Eve was created from his [rib called the] قُصَيْرَى: 4th, that the creation of Eve from Adam being unusual, ثمّ is used to notify its order and posteriority in respect of wonderfulness and of the manifestation of power; not to denote order and posteriority of time: 5th, that ثمّ is here used to denote the order of enunciation; not the virtual order: the replies preceding this last are better than it, inasmuch as they verify the order and the delay; whereas the last verifies the order only, as there is no delay between the two enunciations; but the last reply is of more common application, applying to the ex. given above and to others: (Mughnee:) Fr says that the meaning of the ex. given above is, <i>He created you from a person</i> (<i>which He created</i>) <i>single; then</i> &amp;amp;c.; and in like manner says Zj. (T.) And as to its denoting a delay, Fr asserts that sometimes this is not the case, as is shown by the saying, اَعْجَبَنِى مَا صَنَعْتَ اليَوْمَ <br>\
                  ثُمَّ مَا صَنَعْتَ اَمْسِ اَعْجَبُ [<i>What thou didst to-day excited my wonder,</i> or <i>admiration,</i> or <i>pleasure; then</i> (<i>I tell thee</i>) <i>what thou didst yesterday was more wonderful,</i> or <i>admirable,</i> or <i>pleasing</i>]; for ثمّ is here used to denote the order of the enunciation; not a delay between the two enunciations. (Mughnee, K. *) ―         -b2-  [It is said that] it denotes order and a delay when it conjoins single words: but Akh says that it has the meaning of وَ [<i>And</i>], because it is used in cases in which there is no order; as in وَاْللّٰهِ ثُمَّ وَاْللّٰهِ لَاَفْعَلَنَّ [<i>By God, and</i> (<i>I say again,</i>) <i>By God, I will assuredly do</i> such a thing]: and when it conjoins propositions, it does not necessarily denote order, but has the meaning of وَ: (Msb:) it has the meaning of وَ, (S, Msb,) the conjunction, (S,) in the saying in the Kur [x. 47], ثُمَّ اْللّٰهُ شَهِيدٌ عَلَى مَا يَفْعَلُونَ [<i>And God is witness of what they do</i>]. (S, Msb.) ―         -b3-  The Koofees allow its being used in the manner of فَ and وَ so as that the aor. immediately following it after a conditional verb may be man- soob: and Ibn-Málik allows its being thus used so as that the aor. immediately following it after the expression of a desire that the thing shall not be done may be marfooa and mejzoom and man- soob.

                  <i>nor</i> <br>\
                  رُمّ], the former of these two nouns signifies <i>water-skins,</i> or <i>milk-skins, and vessels;</i> (M;) or <i>what is bad,</i> or <i>the worst, of those things,</i> (S, K,) accord. to ISk; (S;) or <i>men&#39;s household-goods,</i> or <i>furniture and utensils,</i> and <i>their water-skins,</i> or <i>milk-skins, and vessels;</i> (T, TA;) which last is the right meaning: (TA:) and the latter noun signifies مَرَمَّةُ البَيْتِ [app. meaning, accord. to analogy, (for I find no suitable explanation of it in any of the lexicons,) <i>the means by which a house,</i> or <i>tent, is put into a good state;</i> and therefore, <i>good furniture and utensils</i>]. (ISk, S, M, K.) You say also, مَا يَمْلِكُ <br>\
                  ثُمًّا وَلَا رُمًّا, meaning the same: (S, TA:) or <i>he possesses not little nor much:</i> it is not used save with a negation. (M, TA.) An Arab of the desert said, جَعْجَعَ بِىَ الدَّهْرُ عَنْ ثُمِّهِ وَرُمِّهِ, [thus in some copies of the S, and in the TA, in which latter the last two nouns are expressly said to be with damm, but in two copies of the S, in this instance, erroneously written, ثَمِّهِ وَرَمِّهِ,] i. e. [<i>Fortune has debarred me</i>] <i>from its little and its much.</i> (S, TA.) And hence the saying of the vulgar, جَا=ءَ بِالثُّمِّ وَالرُّمِّ, except that they pronounce both these nouns with kesr, meaning <i>He brought little and much.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  See also 1.    </entryFree> <br>\
