                   (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.) and ثِدْىٌ and ثَدًى: (K:) the first of these is the form most commonly obtaining: (TA:) [The <i>breast,</i> or <i>mamma;</i>] the <i>part of the chest whereof the</i> <br>\
                  حَلَمَة <br>\
                  <i>is the head; each of the two parts whereof the</i> <br>\
                  حَلَمَتَانِ <br>\
                  <i>are the two heads:</i> (Zj in his “ Khalk el-Insán: ”) [and sometimes, but not properly, the حَلَمَة alone; i. e., the <i>pap, nipple,</i> or <i>mamilla:</i>] you say ثَدْى مُقْعَدٌ <br>\
                  <i>a breast that is swelling, prominent,</i> or <i>protuberant,</i> (S, A, L, K, in art. قعد,) <i>that fills the hand,</i> (A in that art.,) <i>and has not yet become folding:</i> (S, L, K, in that art.:) and رَضَعَ ثَدْىَ اُمِّهِ [<i>he sucked the breast,</i> meaning <i>the pap,</i> or <i>nipple, of his mother</i>]. (IKtt in TA, art. رضع:) it is <i>peculiar to woman;</i> (T, K;) or <i>common to woman and man;</i> (S, Msb, K;) being sometimes used in relation to a man; (Msb;) accord. to the opinion held to be most chaste and best known by the lexicologists [in general]: (TA:) and is masc.; (T, M, Mgh;) or masc. and fem.; (S, Msb, K;) but most chastely masc.: (TA;) the pl. [of pauc.] is اَثْدٍ, (S, M, Msb, K,] [originally اَثْدُىٌ,] of the measure اَفْعُلٌ, (Msb,) and [of mult.] ثُدِىٌّ, (S, M, Msb, K,) [originally ثُدُوىٌ,] of the measure فُعُولٌ, (S, Msb,) and ثِدِىٌّ, with kesr to the ث because of the kesr to the letter following, (S,) and sometimes ثِدَا=ءٌ, [originally ثِدَاىٌ,] like سِهَامٌ; (Msb;) and a poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>And the women became widowed,</i> or <i>bereft of relations, and without their ornaments,</i> or <i>in mourning, having woe, pulling the breasts</i>]; but this is something like a mistake; and it may be that he meant التُّدِيَّا, and changed the [latter] ى into ن for the sake of the rhyme. (M.) It is said in a prov., تُجَوَّعُ الحُرَّةُ وَلَا تَاْكُلُ ثَدْيَيْهَا, meaning, اُجْرَةَ ثَدْيَيْهَا, [i. e. <i>The ingenuous woman will be made to hunger and will not eat the hire of her breasts,</i>] <i>the prefixed noun being suppressed;</i> or, as some relate it, بِثَدْيَيْهَا, which is plain [as meaning, <i>by means of her breasts</i>]: it is applied in relation to a man&#39;s preserving himself from ignoble means of acquiring wealth. (Mgh.) And جُدَّ ثَدْىُ اُمِّهِ, <i>May his mother&#39;s breast be cut off,</i> is a form of imprecation against a man, and used to imply a wish for his separation. (As, L in art. جد.) The saying of &#39;Alee, on the day of his slaughter of the Khawárij, اُنْظُرُوا فَاـِنَّ فِيِهمْ <br>\
                  رَجُلًا اـِحْدَى يَدَيْهِ مِثْلُ ثَدْىِ المَرْاَةِ [<i>Look ye, for among them is a man one of whose arms is like the breast of the woman</i>], not احدى ثَدْيَيْهِ as some relate it, was applied to a man who had, in the place of one arm, a lump of flesh upon his shoulder-joint, which lump, when it was stretched, became equal in length to his other arm, and when it was left, returned [to its original form]. (Mgh.) Respecting ↓ <br>\
      ثُدَيَّةٌ, the dim., whence the surname ذَو الثُّدَيَّةِ, he who holds ثَدْىٌ to be masc. [only] says that the ة is added because the word [virtually] means اليَد, [which is fem.,] for the man thus surnamed had a short arm, of the size of the ثَدْى, as is indicated by the fact that they also called him ذُو <br>\
                  اليُدَيَّةِ: (S:) or, accord. to Fr, (A&#39;Obeyd, T,) ة is added, in this instance, in the dim., though ثَدْىٌ is masc., because it applies to what resembled the remains (بَقِيَّة) of a ثَدْى, the greater part of it having gone, so that it is like لُحَمْيَةٌ and شُحَيْمَةٌ [dims. of لَحْمَةٌ and شَحْمَةٌ]: (T, M:) or the ة is added because the word is regarded in this case as meaning البَضْعَةُ [the piece, or lump, of flesh]: (Mgh:) some say that it is the dim. of ثَنْدُوَةٌ; (Mgh, TA;) but this requires consideration.
