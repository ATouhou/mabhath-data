                  يرنّا. (K.) A strange verb as to its form, (K,) which [except in its final vowel] is that of an aorist, though it is a preterite. (TA.) Mentioned in the L in art. رنا (q. v.), on the authority of IJ; and there also by ISd; and AHei and others assert the ى to be augmentative. [If so, the verb is a quasi-quadriliteral-radical word.] F follows Sgh, in mentioning it here. (TA.)    &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\

                  حِنَّاءٌ (S, K) [The &lt;i&gt;plant Lawsonia inermis&lt;/i&gt;]. See also art. رنا, where the word is written [erroneously in my opinion] يَرُنَّاٌ. Accord. to IB (not IJ [as in the CK]), the may only be omitted when the word is pronounced with dammeh to the ى. (TA.)   &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\
