                  <i>Shields, of the kind called</i> <br>\
                  تِرْسَةٌ, (K,) pl. of تُرْسٌ; or <i>of the kind called</i> <br>\
                  دَرَقٌ, as is said in the R and M; which two kinds differ in this, that the درق, like the حَجَف, are of skin, or leather, without any wood or sinews (or nerves), whereas ترس is a more general appellation: (TA:) or <i>coats of defence,</i> syn. دُرُوعٌ, (K,) <i>of the fabric of El-Yemen:</i> (TA:) <i>made</i> [app. whether shields or coats of defence] <i>of skins;</i> (K;) i. e., <i>of the hides of camels:</i> (TA:) or <i>coats of defence</i> (دروع) <i>of the fabric of ElYemen, made of skins sewed together:</i> a coll. gen. n., of which the n. un. is يَلَبَةٌ: &#39;Amr Ibn Kulthoom says: <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>Upon us</i> (<i>were</i>) <i>helmets, and leathern coats of defence of the fabric of El-Yemen, and swords that are straight</i> (so accord. to the above reading, of يَقُمْنَ, which I find in an excellent copy of the S: but some read يُقَمْنَ, which, I think, affords not so good a sense:) <i>and that curve</i>]: (S:) or <i>helmets made of camel&#39;s hides:</i> [see also اَلَبٌ and اَلَبَةٌ:] or [<i>head-coverings made of</i>] <i>plaited thongs of leather</i> (نُسُوعٌ) <i>woven together, which are put on the head in lieu of the helmet:</i> (TA:) or <i>skins which are sewed together, and worn on the head,</i> specially: (K:) or <i>skins which are worn beneath the</i> [<i>kind of coat called</i>] دِرْع, or [<i>beneath that of</i>] دِيبَاج; one of which is called يَلَبَةٌ: or <i>skins which are worn like the coats of defence called</i> <br>\
                  دروع: or <i>skins of which such coats are made:</i> (TA:) or <i>any defensive coverings,</i> or <i>armour, of skins; not of iron;</i> and hence, <i>shields</i> (دَرَقٌ) [<i>of skins</i>] are thus called: a poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  <i>their hands, round shields of skins</i>]: and يَلَبٌ, originally is a name of <i>that skin</i> [<i>of which such coverings are made</i>]: Aboo-Dahbal El-Jumahee says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>My coat of mail is smooth and glistening: its cleaving</i> (or <i>sticking close</i>) <i>is an admirable cleaving: and its shield, of good dimensions, is of strips of skin:</i> so accord. to explanations in the S, in arts. شك and قتر: but I incline to think that جوبها here is the same as جَيْبُهَا; and that a word is understood, which makes the meaning to be <i>its opening at the neck and bosom, of good dimensions, is bordered with an edge of thongs</i>]: (S:) or simply <i>skin,</i> or <i>hide.</i> (K.) ―         -b2-  Also <i>defensive coverings,</i> or <i>armour, of pieces of felt</i> (لُبُود), <i>with a stuffing of honey</i> (عَسَل) <i>and sand.</i> (K.) ―         -b3-  Also, <i>Steel;</i> (K;) <i>pure iron:</i> (ISh, T, K:) n. un. يَلَبَةٌ. (TA.) Of this signification, the following hemistich is cited as an ex., <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَمِحْوَرٌ اَخْلَصُ مَن مَّاءِ اليَلَبَ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>And a pulley-axis clearer</i> (<i>in its brightness</i>) <i>than the lustre of pure iron,</i> or <i>steel</i>]: but ISk says that it is by an Arab of the desert, who, hearing the verse of &#39;Amr Ibn-Kulthoom quoted above, erroneously supposed يلب to signify the <i>most excellent kind of iron;</i> and IDrd also asserts that the meaning assigned to it in this hemistich is founded upon a mistake. (TA.) See also اَلَبَةٌ. ―         -b4-  Also, Anything <i>great, big,</i> or <i>large in size.</i> (K.)   </entryFree> <br>\
