[It is said in the M that Lh mentions the last two sayings; but it is there indicated that he read قَطْرَةً and سَمَا=ءً: and] ISk mentions the saying, لَا اَفْعَلُهُ مَا اَنَّ فِى السَّمَا=ءِ نَجْمًا, (T, M,) and مَا عَنَّ <br>\
                  فِى السَّمَا=ءِ نَجْمٌ; (T;) [in the former of which, اَنّ must be a particle (which see below); but it seems that it should rather be اـِنَّ, in this case, as ISd thinks; for he says,] I know not for what reason انّ is here with fet-h, unless a verb be understood before it, as ثَبَتَ or وُجِدَ: [and he adds,] Lh mentions مَا اَنَّ ذلِكَ الجَبَلَ مَكَانَهُ [&lt;i&gt;as long as that mountain is in its place&lt;/i&gt;]: and مَا اَنَّ <br>\
                  حِرَا=ءً مَكَانَهُ [&lt;i&gt;as long as&lt;/i&gt; Mount &lt;i&gt;Hirà is in its place&lt;/i&gt;]: but he does not explain these sayings. (M.)    &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                  &lt;/form&gt; is a pronoun, denoting the speaker, [&lt;i&gt;I,&lt;/i&gt; masc. and fem.,] in the language of some of the Arabs: they say, اَنْ فَعَلْتُ [&lt;i&gt;I did&lt;/i&gt;], with the ن quiescent: but most of them pronounce it [↓ <br>\
      اَنَ] with fet-h when conjoined with a following word; (Mughnee, K;) saying, اَنَ فَعَلْتُ: (TA:) and [↓ <br>\
      اَنَا] with ا in a case of pause: (Mughnee, K:) and &lt;pb n=&quot;104&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; some pronounce it with ا also when it is conjoined with a following word; saying, اَنَا فَعَلْتُ; [as we generally find it written in books;] but this is of a bad dialect: (TA:) [this last assertion, however, requires consideration; for the dial. here said to be bad is that of Temeem, accord. to what here follows:] the Basrees hold that the pronoun consists of the ء and the ن, and that the [final] ا is redundant, because it is suppressed in a case of conjunction with a following word; but the Koofees hold that the pronoun is composed of all the three letters, because the ا is preserved in a case of conjunction with a following word in the dial. of Temeem. (Marginal note in a copy of the Mughnee.) [Accord. to Az,] it is best to say ↓ <br>\
      اَنَا in a case of pause; and ↓ <br>\
      اَنَ in a case of conjunction with a following word, as in اَنَ فَعَلْتُ <br>\
                  ذَاكَ [&lt;i&gt;I did that&lt;/i&gt;]; but some of the Arabs say, فَعَلْتُ ذَاكَ ↓ <br>\
      اَنَا; and some make the ن quiescent in a case of this kind, though this is rare, saying, اَنْ قُلْتُ ذَاكَ [&lt;i&gt;I said that&lt;/i&gt;]; and Kudá&#39;ah prolong the former ا, saying, قُلْتُهُ ↓ <br>\
      ا=نَ. (T.) [Accord. to J,] ↓ <br>\
      اَنَا is a pronoun denoting the speaker alone, and is made to end invariably with fet-h to distinguish it from the particle اَنْ which renders the aor. mansoob; the final ا being for the purpose of showing what is the vowel in a case of pause; but when it occurs in the middle [or beginning] of a sentence, it is dropped, except in a bad dialect. (S.) [Accord. to ISd,] ↓ <br>\
      اَنَ is a noun denoting the speaker; and in a case of pause, you add ا at the end, [saying ↓ <br>\
      اَنَا,] to denote quiescence; (M;) [or] it is better to do this, though it is not always done: (TA:) but it is said, on the authority of Ktr, that there are five dial. vars. of this word; namely, فَعَلْتُ ↓ <br>\
      اَنَ, and ↓ <br>\
      اَنَا, and ↓ <br>\
      ا=نَ, and اَنٌ, and ↓ <br>\
      اَنَهٌ, all mentioned by IJ; but there is some weakness in this: IJ says that the ه in ↓ <br>\
      اَنَهٌ may be a substitute for the ا in اَنَا, because the latter is the more usual, and the former is rare; or it may be added to show what is the vowel, like the ه, and be like the ه in كِتَابِيَهْ and حِسَابِيَهٌ. (M.) For the dual, as well as the pl., only نَحْنُ is used. (Az, TA.) ―         -b2-  It is also a pronoun denoting the person addressed, or spoken to, by assuming the form ↓ <br>\
      اَنْتَ [&lt;i&gt;Thou,&lt;/i&gt; masc.]; ت being added to it as the sign of the person addressed, (S, M, Mughnee, K,) and اَنْ being the pronoun, (M, Mughnee, K,) accord. to the general opinion; (Mughnee, K;) the two becoming as one; not that one is prefixed to the other as governing it in the gen. case: (S:) and so ↓ <br>\
      اَنْتِ, (S, M, Mughnee, K,) addressed to the female: (S, M:) and ↓ <br>\
      اَنْتُمَا, (M, Mughnee, K,) addressed to two; not a regular dual, for were it so it would be اَنْتَان; but like كُمَا in ضَرَبْتُكُمَا: (M:) and ↓ <br>\
      اَنْتُمٌ and ↓ <br>\
      اَنْتُنَّ, (S, Mughnee, K,) which are [respectively] the masc. and fem. pls. (TA.) ―         -b3-  To each of these the ك of comparison is sometimes prefixed; so that you say, ↓ <br>\
      اَنْتَ كَاَنَا [&lt;i&gt;Thou art like me,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;as I&lt;/i&gt;], and ↓ <br>\
      اَنَا كَاَنْتَ [or اَنَ كَاَنْتَ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;I am like thee,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;as thou&lt;/i&gt;]; as is related on the authority of the Arabs; for though the ك of comparison is not prefixed to the [affixed] pronoun, and you say, اَنْتَ كَزَيْدٍ but not اَنْتَ كِي, yet the separate pronoun is regarded by them as being in the same predicament as the noun; and therefore the prefixing it to the latter kind of pronoun is approved. (S.) It is said in the Book of لَيْسَ, by IKh, that there is no such phrase, in the language of the Arabs, as اَنْتَ كِى, nor as اَنَا كَكَ, except in two forged verses; wherefore Sb says that the Arabs, by saying اَنْتَ مِثْلِى and اَنَا مثْلُكَ, have no need of saying اَنْتَ كِى and اَنَا كَكَ: and the two verses are these: &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        وَلَوْلَا البَلَا=ءُ لَكَانُوا كَنَا <br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        فَلَوْلَا الحَيَا=اـُ لَكُنَّا كَهُمٌ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;And but for the sense of shame, we had been like them,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;as they: and but for trial,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;affliction, they had been like us,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;as we&lt;/i&gt;]: and &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اـِنْ تَكُنْ كِى فِاـِنَّنِي كَكَ فِيهَا<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اـِنَّنَا فِى المَلَامِ مُصْطَحِبَانِ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;If thou art like me,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;as I, verily I am like thee,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;as thou, in respect of her,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;it,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;them: verily we, in respect of blame, are companions&lt;/i&gt;]. (TA.) Az mentions his having heard some of the Benoo-Suleym say, كَمَا اَنْتَنِي, [the latter word being a compound of the pronoun اَنْتَ, regularly written separately, and the affixed pronoun نِى,] meaning &lt;i&gt;Wait thou for me in thy place.&lt;/i&gt; (TA.)       -A2-  It is also a particle: and as such, it is—First, a particle of the kind called مَصْدَرِىٌّ, rendering the aor. mansoob: (Mughnee, K:) i. e., (TA,) it combines with a verb [in this case] in the future [or aor.] tense, following it, to form an equivalent to an inf. n., and renders it mansoob: (S, TA:) you say, اُرِيدُ اَنْ تَقُومَ [&lt;i&gt;I desire that thou stand,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;that thou wouldst stand,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;that thou mayest stand&lt;/i&gt;]; meaning اُرِيدُ قِيَامَكَ [&lt;i&gt;I desire thy standing&lt;/i&gt;]. (S.) It occurs in two places: first, in that of the inchoative, or in the beginning of a phrase, so that it is in the place of a nom. case; as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 180], وَاَنْ تَصُومُوا خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ [&lt;i&gt;And that ye fast is better for you&lt;/i&gt;]; (Mughnee, K;) i. e. صِيَامُكُمْ [&lt;i&gt;your fasting&lt;/i&gt;]. (TA.) And, secondly, after a word denoting a meaning which is not that of certainty: and thus it is the place of a nom. case; as in the saying [in the Kur lvii. 15], اَلَمْ يَاَنِ لِلَّذِينَ ا=مَنُوا اَنٌ تَخْشَعَ قُلُوبُهُمْ [&lt;i&gt;Hath not the time that their hearts should become submissive,&lt;/i&gt; i. e. &lt;i&gt;the time of their hearts&#39; becoming submissive, yet come unto those who have believed?&lt;/i&gt;]: and in the place of an accus. case; as in the saying [in the Kur x. 38], وَمَا كَانَ هذَا <br>\
                  القْرْا=نُ اَنْ يُفْتَرَء [&lt;i&gt;And this Kur-án is not&lt;/i&gt; such &lt;i&gt;that it might be forged;&lt;/i&gt; i. e., افُتِرِا=ءٌ; so in Bd and Jel; and so in a marginal note to a copy of the Mughnee, where is added, meaning مُفْتَرًى <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;forged&lt;/i&gt;]: and in the place of a gen. case; as in the saying [in the Kur lxiii. 10], مِنْ قَبْلِ اَنْ يَاْتِىَ <br>\
                  اَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ [&lt;i&gt;Before that death come unto any one of you;&lt;/i&gt; i. e. &lt;i&gt;before death&#39;s coming unto any one of you&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee, K.) Sometimes it makes the aor. to be of the mejzoom form, (Mughnee, K,) as some of the Koofees and AO have mentioned, and as Lh has stated on the authority of certain of the Benoo-Sabbáh of Dabbeh; (Mughnee;) as in this verse: &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اـِذَا مَا غَدَوْنَا قَالَ وِلْدَانُ اَهْلِنَا<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        تَعَالوْغا اـِلَى اَنْ يَاْتِنَا الصَّيْدُ نَحْطِبِ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;When we went away in the morning, the youths of our family,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;people, said, Come ye, until that the chase come to us,&lt;/i&gt; (i. e. &lt;i&gt;until the coming of the chase to us,&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;let us collect firewood&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee, K.) And sometimes it is followed by an aor. of the marfooa form; as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 233], accord. to the reading of Ibn-Moheysin, لِمَنْ اَرَادَ اَنْ يُتِمُّ الرَّضَاعَةَ [&lt;i&gt;For him who desireth that he may complete the&lt;/i&gt; time of &lt;i&gt;sucking;&lt;/i&gt; i. e. &lt;i&gt;the completing thereof&lt;/i&gt;]; (Mughnee, K;) but this is anomalous, (I &#39;Ak p. 101, and TA,) or اَنْ is here a contraction of اَنَّ [for اَنَّهُ]: (I &#39;Ak:) and in the saying of the poet, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اَنْ تَقَرَا=نِ عَلَي اَسْمَا=ءِ وَيْحَكُمَا<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        مِنِّى السَّلَامَ وَاَنْ لَا تُخْبِرَا اَحَدَا<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;That ye two convey,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;communicate, to Asmà,&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;mercy on you!&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;woe to you!&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;from me, salutation, and that ye inform not any one&lt;/i&gt;]; but the Koofees assert that اَنٌ is here [in the beginning of the verse] a contraction of اَنَّ, and anomalously conjoined with the verb; whereas the Basrees correctly say that it is اَنٌ which renders the aor. mansoob, but is deprived of government by its being made to accord with its co-ordinate مَا, termed مَصْدَرِيَّة; (Mughnee;) or, as IJ says, on the authority of Aboo-&#39;Alee, اَنٌ is here used by poetic licence for اَنَّكُمَا; and the opinion of the Baghdádees [and Basrees], that it is likened to مَا, and therefore without government, is improbable, because اَنْ is not conjoined with a verb in the present tense, but only with the preterite and the future. (M.) When it is suppressed, the aor. may be either mansoob or marfooa; but the latter is the better; as in the saying in the Kur [xxxix. 64], اَفَغَيْرَ اللّٰهِ تَاْمُرُونِّى اَعْبُدُ [&lt;i&gt;Other than God do ye bid me worship?&lt;/i&gt;]. (S.) If it occurs immediately before a preterite, it combines with it to form an equivalent to an inf. n. relating to past time; being in this case without government: you say, اَعْجَيَنِياَنْ قُمْتَ [&lt;i&gt;It pleased me that thou stoodest&lt;/i&gt;]; meaning &lt;i&gt;thy standing that is past pleased me:&lt;/i&gt; (S:) and thus it is used in the saying [in the Kur xxviii. 82], لَوْلَا اَنٌ مَنَّ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْنَا [&lt;i&gt;Were it not for that God conferred favour upon us;&lt;/i&gt; i. e., &lt;i&gt;for God&#39;s having conferred favour upon us&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee.) It is also conjoined with an imperative; as in the phrase mentioned by Sb, كَتَبْتُ اـِلَيهِ بِاَنة قُمٌ [&lt;i&gt;I wrote to him, Stand;&lt;/i&gt; i. e. &lt;i&gt;I wrote to him the command to stand&lt;/i&gt;]; which shows that AHei is wrong in asserting that whenever it is conjoined with an imperative it is an explicative [in the sense of اَيٌ], and that in this particular instance the ب may be redundant, which it cannot here be, because, whether redundant or not, it is not put immediately before anything but a noun or what may be rendered by a noun. (Mughnee.) ―         -b2-  Secondly, it is a con- &lt;pb n=&quot;105&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; traction of اَنَّ; (Mughnee, K;) and occurs after a verb denoting certainty, or one used in a manner similar to that of such a verb: (Mughnee:) so in the saying [in the Kur lxxiii. 20], عَلِمَ اَنٌ سَيَكُونُ <br>\
                  مِنْكُمٌ مَرْضَي [&lt;i&gt;He knoweth that&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;the case will be&lt;/i&gt; this:) &lt;i&gt;there will be among you some diseased;&lt;/i&gt; the affixed pronoun هُ, meaning اشَّاْنَ, being understood after اَنْ, which therefore stands for اَنَّهُ, i. e.    &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                  &lt;/form&gt;]: (Mughnee, K: *) and in the phrase, بَلَغَنِى اَنْ قَدْ كَانَ كَذَا وكَذَا [&lt;i&gt;It has come to my knowledge,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;been related to me, or been told to me,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;it came to my knowledge,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c., &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;the case&lt;/i&gt; is this:) &lt;i&gt;such and such things have been&lt;/i&gt;]; a phrase of this kind, in which اَنْ occurs with a verb, not being approved without قَدْ, unless you say, بَلَغَنِى اَنَّهُ كَانَ كَذَا وَكَذَا: (Lth, T:) [for] when the contracted اَنْ has for its predicate a verbal proposition, of which the verb is neither imperfectly inflected, like لَيْسَ and عَسَى, nor expressive of a prayer or an imprecation, it is separated from the verb, according to the more approved usage, by قَدْ, or the prefix سَ, or سَوْفَ, or a negative, as لَا &amp;amp;c., or لَوْ: (I &#39;Ak pp. 100 and 101:) but when its predicate is a nominal proposition, it requires not a separation; so that you say, عَلِمْتُ اَنْ زَِيْدٌ قَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;I knew that&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;the case was this:&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;Zeyd was standing&lt;/i&gt;]; (I &#39;Ak p. 100;) and بَلَغَنِى اَنْ زَيدٌ خَارِجٌ [&lt;i&gt;It has come to my knowledge,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;been related to me,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;been told to me,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c., &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;the case is&lt;/i&gt; this:) &lt;i&gt;Zeyd is going,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;coming, out,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;forth&lt;/i&gt;]; (TA;) except in the case of a negation, as in the saying in the Kur [xi. 17], واَنْ لَا اـِلهَ اـِلَّا هُوَ [&lt;i&gt;And that&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;the case is&lt;/i&gt; this:) &lt;i&gt;there is no deity but He&lt;/i&gt;]. (I &#39;Ak p. 100.) Thus used, it is originally triliteral, and is also what is termed مَصْدَرِيَّة; [عَلِمَ اَنْ, in the first of the exs. above, for instance, meaning عَلِمَ اَنَّهُ, i. e. عَلِمَ اَنَّ <br>\
                  الشَّاْنَ, which is equivalent to عَلِمَ كَوْنَ الشَّاْنِ;] and governs the subject in the accus. case, and the predicate in the nom. case: and its subject must be a pronoun, suppressed, [as in the exs. given above, where it means الشَّاْنِ, and in a verse cited before, commencing اَنْ تَقْرَا=نِ, accord. to A&#39;boo-&#39;Alee,] or expressed; the latter, accord. to the more correct opinion, being allowable only by poetic license: and its predicate must be a proposition, unless the subject is expressed, in which case it may be either a single word or a proposition; both of which kinds occur in the following saying [of a poet]: &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\

                  &lt;/quote&gt; [he is speaking of persons coming as guests to him whom he addresses, when their provisions are exhausted, and the horizon is dust-coloured, and the north wind is blowing, (as is shown by the citation of the verse immediately preceding, in the T,) and he says, They know &lt;i&gt;that thou art&lt;/i&gt; like &lt;i&gt;rain that produces spring-herbage, and&lt;/i&gt; like &lt;i&gt;plenteous rain, and that thou, there, art the aider and the manager of the affairs of people&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee. [In the T, for رَبِيعٌ, I find الَّربِيعُ; and for وَاَنْكَ, I there find وَقِدْمًا: but the reading in the Mughnee is that which is the more known.]) [J says,] اَنْ is sometimes a contraction of اَنَّ and does not govern [anything]: you say, بَلَغَنِى <br>\
                  اَنٌ زَيْدٌ خَارِجٌ [explained above]; and it is said in the Kur [vii. 41], وَنُودُوا اَنْ تِلْكُمُ الجَنَّةُ [&lt;i&gt;And it shall be proclaimed to them that&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;the case is&lt;/i&gt; this:) &lt;i&gt;that is Paradise&lt;/i&gt;]: (S:) [here, however, اَنة is regarded by some as an explicative, as will be seen below:] but in saying this, J means that it does not govern as to the letter; for virtually it does govern; its subject being meant to be understood; the virtual meaning being اَنَّهُ تِلْكُمُ الجَنَّةُ. (IB.) [In another place, J says,] You may make the contracted اَنْ to govern or not, as you please. (S.) Aboo-Tálib the Grammarian mentions an assertion that the Arabs make it to govern; as in the saying [of a poet, describing a beautiful bosom], &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        كَاَنْ ثَذْيَيْهِ حُقَّانِ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;As though its two breasts were two small round boxes&lt;/i&gt;]: but [the reading commonly known is &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        كَاَنْ ثَدْيَاهُ حُقَّانِ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; (this latter reading is given in De Sacy&#39;s Anthol. Gram. Ar. p. 104 of the Ar. text; and both are given in the S;) كَاَنْ here meaning كَاَنَّهُ; and] Fr says, We have not heard the Arabs use the contracted form and make it to govern except with a pronoun, in which case the desinential syntax is not apparent. (T.) The author of the K says in the B that you say, عَلِمْتُ اَنْ زيْدًا <br>\
                  لَمُنْطَلِقٌ [&lt;i&gt;I knew that Zeyd was indeed going away&lt;/i&gt;], with ل when it is made to govern; and عَلِمْتُ اَنْ زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ [&lt;i&gt;I knew that&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;the case was&lt;/i&gt; this:) &lt;i&gt;Zeyd was going away&lt;/i&gt;], without ل when it is made to have no government. (TA. [But in the latter ex. it governs the subject, which is understood, as in other exs. before given.]) [See an ex. in a verse ending with the phrase وَكَاَنْ قَدِ cited voce قَد, where كَاَنْ is for كَاَنَّهُ, meaning كَاَنَّ <br>\
                  الشّانَ, and a verb is understood after قد. And see also اَنَّ, below.]―         -b2- Thirdly, it is an explicative, (Mughnee, K,) meaning اَيْ (S, M, and so in some copies of the K,) or [rather] used in the manner of اَيْ; (Mughnee, and so in some copies of the K;) [meaning قَايِلًا, or قَايِلِينَ; or يَقُولُ, or يَقُولُونَ; or some other form of the verb قَالَ; i. e. &lt;i&gt;Saying ;&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.;] as in the saying [in the Kur xxiii. 27], فَاَوْحَيْنَا اـِلَيْهِ اَنِ اصْنَعِ الْقُلْكَ [&lt;i&gt;And we revealed, or spake by revelation, unto him, saying, Make thou the ark&lt;/i&gt;]; (Mughnee, K) and [in the Kur vii. 41,]وَنُودُوا اَنْ تِلْكُمُ <br>\
                  الْجَنَّةُ [&lt;i&gt;And it shall be proclaimed to them, being said, That is Paradise&lt;/i&gt;]; or in these two instances it may be regarded as what is termed مَصْدَرِيَّة, by supposing the preposition [بِ] understood before it, so that in the former instance it is the biliteral, because it is put before the imperative, and in the second it is the contraction of اَنَّ because it is put before a nominal proposition; (Mughnee;) and [in the Kur xxxviii. 5,] وَانْطَلَقَ <br>\
                  الْمَلَاُ مِنْهُمْ اَنِ امْشُوا(S, M, Mughnee) i. e. [&lt;i&gt;And the chief persons of them&lt;/i&gt;] broke forth, or launched forth, with their tongues, or in speech, [saying,] Go ye on, or continue ye, in your course of action &amp;amp;c. (Mughnee.) For this usage of اَنْ certain conditions are requisite : first, that it be preceded by a proposition : secondly, that it be followed by a proposition; so that you may not say, ذَكَرْتُ <br>\
                  عَسْجَدًا اَنْ ذَهَبًا, but you must say اَىٌ in this case, or must omit the explicative : thirdly, that the preceding proposition convey the meaning of القَوْلُ, as in the exs. above; in the last of which, انطلق has the meaning assigned to it above; not that of walking or going away : fourthly, that there be not in the preceding proposition the letters of القَوْلُ; so that one may not say, قُلْتُ لَهُ اَنِ افْعَلْ; or, if there be in it those letters, that the word which they compose shall be interpreted by another word; as in the saying, in the Kur [v, 117], مَا قُلْتُ لَهُمْ اـِلَّا مَا اَمَرْتَنِى بِهِ اَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللّٰهَ which may mean, as Z says, &lt;i&gt; I have not commanded them&lt;/i&gt; [aught &lt;i&gt;save that which Thou commandedst me, saying, Worship ye God&lt;/i&gt;]; (Mughnee;) in which instance Fr says that it is an explicative : (T :) fifthly, that there be not a preposition immediately before it; for if you say, كَتَبْتُ اـِلَيْهِ بِاَنِ افْعَلْ كَذَا, it is what is termed مَصْدَرِيَّة [as we have before shown]. (Mughnee.) When it may be regarded as an explicative and is followed by an aor. with لا as in اَشَرْتُ اـِلَيْهِ اَنْ <br>\
                  لَا تَفْعَل كَذَا, it may be marfooa, [namely, the aor.,] on the supposition that لا is a negative ; or mejzoom, on the supposition that it is a prohibitive; and in both cases ان is an explicative ; [so that the meaning is, &lt;i&gt;I made a sign to him,&lt;/i&gt; as though &lt;i&gt;saying, Thou wilt not do such a thing,&lt;/i&gt; in the former case ; or, in the latter, &lt;i&gt;Do not thou such a thing ;&lt;/i&gt;] or mansoob, on the supposition that لا is a negative and that ان is what is termed مَصْدَرِيَّة: but if لا is wanting, it may not be mejzoom, but may be marfooa [if we use ان as an explicative] or mansoob [if ان be what is termed مَصْدَرِيَّة]. (Mughnee.)―         -b3-  Fourthly, it is redundant, as a corroborative, (Mughnee, K,) like whatever else is redundant : and thus it is in four cases : one of these, which is the most common, being when it occurs after لَمَّا denoting time; [and this is mentioned in the M ; ] as in the saying [in the Kur xxix. 32], وَلمَّا اَنْ جَا=ءَ تْ <br>\
                  رُسُلُنَا لُوطًا [&lt;i&gt;And when our apostles came to Lot&lt;/i&gt;]: (Mughnee:) [or,] accord. to J, (TA,) it is sometimes a connective to لَمَّا; as in the saying in the Kur [xii. 96], فَلَمَّا اَنْ جَا=ءَ الْبَشِيرُ [&lt;i&gt;And when that&lt;/i&gt; (like as we say, &quot; now that,&quot;) &lt;i&gt;the announcer of good tidings came&lt;/i&gt;] : and sometimes it is redundant ; as in the saying in the Kur [viii. 34], وَمَا لَهُمْ اَنْ لَا يُعَذِبَهُمُ اللّٰهُ [as though it might be rendered &lt;i&gt;But what reason have they, God should not punish them?&lt;/i&gt;] : (S, TA:) but IB says that the connective is redundant ; and [that ان is not redundant in the latter instance, for] if it were redundant in this verse of the Kur it would not render the [aor.] verb mansoob. (TA. [The author of the Mughnee, like IB, disallows that ان is redundant in a case of this kind, which Kh asserts it to be ; and says that فِى is under- &lt;pb n=&quot;106&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; stood before it.]) The second case is when it occurs between لَوٌ and a verb signifying swearing, the latter being expressed; as in this verse: &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        فَاُقْسِمُ اَنْ لَوِ اْلْتَقَيْنَا وَاَنْتُمُ<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        لَكَانَ لَنَا يَوْمٌ مِنَ الشَّرِّ مُظْلِمُ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;And I swear, had we and you met, there had been to us a dark day of evil&lt;/i&gt;]: and when that verb is omitted; as in the following ex.: &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اَمَا وَاْللّٰهِ اَنْ لَوْ كُنْتَ حُرِّا<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        وَمَا بِاْلْحُِرِاَنْتَ وَلَا العَتِيقِ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Verily,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;now surely, by God, if thou wert freeborn; but thou art not the freeborn nor the emancipated&lt;/i&gt;]: so say Sb and others: Ibn-&#39;Os- foor holds it to be a particle employed to connect the complement of the oath with the oath; but this is rendered improbable by the fact that it is in most cases omitted, and such particles are not. (Mughnee.) The third case, which is extr., is when it occurs between the ك [of comparison] and the noun governed by it in the genitive case; as in the saying, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        وَيَوْمًا تُوَافِينَا بِوَجْهٍ مُقَسَّمٍ<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        كَاَنٌ ظَبْيَةٍ تَعْطُو اـِلَى وَارِقِ السَّلَمْ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;And on a day thou comest to us with a beautiful face, like a doe-gazelle raising her head towards the goodly green-leaved tree of the selem kind&lt;/i&gt;], accord. to the reading of him who makes طبيةْ to be governed in the genitive case [instead of the accus. or the nom.; for if we read it in the accus. or the nom., اَنْ is a contraction of اَنَّ; in the former case, ظبية being its subject, and its predicate being suppressed; and in the latter case, the meaning being كَاَنَّهَا ظَبْيَةٌ, so that the subject of ان is suppressed]. (Mughnee.) The fourth case is when it occurs after اـِذَا; as in the following ex.: &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        فَاُمْهلُهُ حَتَّى اـذَا اَنْ كَاَنَّهُ<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        مُعَاطِى يَدٍ فِي لُجَّةِ المَا=ءِ غَامِرُ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;And I leave him alone until when he is as though he were a giver of a hand&lt;/i&gt; to be laid hold upon, &lt;i&gt;in the fathomless deep of the water immerged&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee.) ―         -b4-  [Fifthly,] among other meanings which have been assigned to it, (Mughnee,) it has a conditional meaning, like اـِنٌ: (Mughnee, K:) so the Koofees hold; and it seems to be most probably correct, for several reasons: first, because both these forms occur, accord. to different readings, in several instances, in one passage of the Kur; as in [ii. 282,] اَنْ تَضِلٌّ <br>\
                  اـِحْدَاهُمَا [&lt;i&gt;If one of them twain&lt;/i&gt; (namely, women,) &lt;i&gt;err&lt;/i&gt;]; &amp;amp;c.: secondly, because [the prefix] فَ often occurs after it; as in a verse commencing with اَبَا خُرَاشَةَ [as cited voce اَمَّا, accord. to some who hold that امَّا in that verse is a compound of the conditional اَنْ and the redundant مَا; and as in the Kur ii. 282, where the words quoted above are immediately followed by فَتُذَكِّرَ اـِحْدَاهُمَا <br>\
                  اْلْاُخْرَى]: thirdly, because it is conjoined with اـِنٌ [which forms a part of the compound اـِكَّا] in this ex.: &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اـِمَّا اَقَمْتَ وَاَمَّا اَنْتَ مُرْتَحِلًا<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        فَاْللّٰهُ يَكْلَاُ مَا تَاْتِى وَمَا تَذَرُ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;If thou remain, and if thou be going away&lt;/i&gt; (اَمَّا meaning اَنْ كُنْتَ, as syn. with اـِنْ كُنْتَ), &lt;i&gt;may God guard&lt;/i&gt; thee (يَكْلَاُ being marfooa because of the ف) &lt;i&gt;as long as thou doest and as long as thou leavest undone&lt;/i&gt;]: thus related, with kesr to the former ان [in اـِنَّا] and with fet-h to the latter [in اَمَّا]. (Mughnee.) ―         -b5-  [Sixthly,] it is a negative, like اـِنْ: (Mughnee, K:) so, as some say, in [the Kur iii. 66,] اَنع يُوْتَى اَحَدٌ مِثْلَ مَا اُوتِيتُمْ [meaning accord. to them &lt;i&gt;Not any one is given the like of that&lt;/i&gt; scripture &lt;i&gt;which ye have been given&lt;/i&gt;]: but it is said [by others] that the meaning is, [taken with what precedes it,] And believe not ye &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; (بِاَنْ) &lt;i&gt;any one is given the like of that&lt;/i&gt; scripture &lt;i&gt;which ye have been given,&lt;/i&gt; except it be given to him who followeth your religion; and that the phrase “ say thou, Verily the direction is the direction of God, ” is parenthetic. (Mughnee.) ―         -b6-  [Seventhly,] it is syn. with اـِذْ, (AZ, T, Mughnee, K, [in Freytag&#39;s Lex., from the K, اـِذْ قِيلَ, but قيل in the K relates to what there follows,]) as some say, in [the Kur l. 2,] بَلْ عَجِبُوا اَنٌ جَا=ءَهُمْ مُنْذِرٌمِنْهُمْ [&lt;i&gt;Verily they wonder because a warner from among themselves hath come unto them&lt;/i&gt;]; (Mughnee, K;) and in other instances; but correctly, in all these instances, ان is what is termed مَصْدَرِيَّة, and لِ denoting cause is understood before it. (Mughnee.) [See also اَمَّا and اـِمَّا.] ―         -b7-  [Eighthly,] it is &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  لِيَلّا, accord. to some, in [the Kur iv. last verse,] يُبَيِّنُ اْللّٰهُاَنْ تَضِلُّوا [&lt;i&gt;God explaineth to you&lt;/i&gt; (the ordinances of your religion, Jel), &lt;i&gt;lest ye should err,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;in order that ye may not err&lt;/i&gt;]; (Mughnee, K;) and in the saying, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        نَزَلْتُمْ مَنْزِلَ الاَضْيَافِ مِنَّا<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        فَعَجَّلْنَا القِرَى اَنْ تَشْتِمُونَا<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Ye became,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;have become, in the condition of our guests; so we hastened,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;have hastened, the entertainment, lest ye should revile us,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;in order that ye should not revile us&lt;/i&gt;]: (Mughnee:) but correctly, in such a case [likewise], ان is what is termed مَصْدَرِيَّة, and the original wording is كَرَاهَةَ اَنْ تَضِلُّوا [&lt;i&gt;from a motive of dislike that ye should err&lt;/i&gt;], (Mughnee, K,) and مَخَافَةَ اَنْ <br>\
                  تَشْتِمُونَا [&lt;i&gt;from a motive of fear that ye should revile us&lt;/i&gt;]: so say the Basrees: some say, extravagantly, that ل is meant to be understood before it, and الَّذِى after it. (Mughnee.) ―         -b8-  [Ninthly,] it occurs in the sense of الَّذِى; as in the saying, زَيْدٌ اَعْقَلُ مِنٌ اَنْ يَكْذِب [&lt;i&gt;Zeyd is more reasonable than he who lies;&lt;/i&gt; which is equivalent to saying, &lt;i&gt;Zeyd is too reasonable to lie:&lt;/i&gt; but respecting its usage in a phrase of this kind, and respecting the form of the aor. after it in such a case, see مِنْ]. (Kull p. 78.) ―         -b9-  By a peculiarity of pronunciation termed عَنْعَتَةٌ, the tribe of Temeem say عَنْ instead of اَنٌ. (M.)    &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\
&lt;entryFree id=&quot;n1295&quot; key=&quot;اـِنٌ&quot; type=&quot;main&quot;&gt;               1     <br>\
                     اـِنٌ<br>\
                     ان<br>\
                     اـن<br>\
                     ان<br>\
                     ونى<br>\
                     آن<br>\
                  &lt;/form&gt; is used in various ways: first, as a conditional particle, (S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K,) denoting the happening of the second of two events in consequence of the happening of the first, (S, Msb, *) whether the second be immediate or deferred, and whether the condition be affirmative or negative; (Msb;) [and as such it is followed by a mejzoom aor., or by a pret. having the signification of an aor.;] as in the saying, [اـِنْ تَفْعَلٌ افْعَلٌ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;If thou do&lt;/i&gt; such a thing, &lt;i&gt;I will do&lt;/i&gt; it; and] اـِنْ تَاْتِنِى ا=تِكَ [&lt;i&gt;If thou come to me, I will come to thee&lt;/i&gt;]; and اـِنٌ جِيْتَنِى اَكْرَمْتُكَ [&lt;i&gt;If thou come to me, I will treat thee with honour&lt;/i&gt;]; (S;) and اـِنْ فَعَلْتَ فَعَلْتُ [&lt;i&gt;If thou do, I will do&lt;/i&gt;] for which the tribe of Teiyi say, as IJ relates on the authority of Ktr, هِنْ فَعَلْتَ فَعَلْتُ; (M;) and اـِنْ دَخَلْت الدَّارَ اَوٌ [&lt;i&gt;If thou stand, I will stand&lt;/i&gt;]; and اـِنْ دَخَلْتِ الدَّارَ اَوْ <br>\
                  لَمْ تَدْخُلِى الدَّارض فَاَنْتِ طَالقٌ [&lt;i&gt;If thou enter the house,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;if thou enter not the house, thou shalt be divorced&lt;/i&gt;]; (Msb;) and [in the Kur viii. 39,] اـِنْ يَنْتَهُوا يُغْفَرٌ لَهُمْ مَا قَد سَلَفَ [&lt;i&gt;If they desist, what hath already past shall be forgiven them&lt;/i&gt;]; and [in verse 19 of the same ch.,] وَاـِنْ تَعُودُوا نَعُدْ [&lt;i&gt;But if ye return&lt;/i&gt; to attacking the Apostle, &lt;i&gt;we will return&lt;/i&gt; to assisting him]. (Mughnee, K.) [On the difference between it and اـِذا, see the latter.] When either it or اـِذَا is immediately followed by a noun in the nom. case, the said noun is governed in that case by a verb necessarily suppressed, of which it is the agent; as in the saying, in the Kur [ix. 6], وَاـِنْ اَحَدٌ مِنَ <br>\
                  اْلْمُشْرِكِينَ اْستَجَارَكَ; the complete phrase being وَاـِنِ <br>\
                  اسْتَجَارَكَ اَحَدٌ مِنَ اْلْمُشْرِكِينَ اْسْتَجَارَكَ [&lt;i&gt;And if any one of the believers in a plurality of gods demand protection of thee,&lt;/i&gt; (if) &lt;i&gt;he demand protection of thee&lt;/i&gt;]: so accord. to the generality of the grammarians. (I &#39;Ak p. 123.) Sometimes it is conjoined with the negative لَا, and the ignorant may imagine it to be the exceptive اـِلَّا; as in [the saying in the Kur ix. 40,] اـِلَّا تَنْصُرُوهُ فَقَد نَصَرَهُ اْللّٰهُ [&lt;i&gt;If ye will not aid him, certainly God did aid him&lt;/i&gt;]; and [in the next preceding verse,] اـِلَّا تَنْفِرُوا يُعَذِّبْكُمْ [&lt;i&gt;If ye will not go forth to war, He will punish you&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee, K. *) It is sometimes used to denote one&#39;s feigning himself ignorant; as when you say to one who asks, “ Is thy child in the house? ” and thou hast knowledge thereof, اـِنْ كَانَ فِى الدَّارِ اَعْلَمْتُكَ بِهِ [&lt;i&gt;If he be in the house, I will inform thee thereof&lt;/i&gt;]. (Msb.) And to denote one&#39;s putting the knowing in the predicament of the ignorant, in order to incite to the doing or continuing an action; as when you say, اـِنٌ كُنْتَ اْبُنِى فَاَطِعْنِى [&lt;i&gt;If thou be my son, obey me&lt;/i&gt;]; as though you said, “ Thou knowest that thou art my son, and it is incumbent on the son to obey the father, and thou art not obedient; therefore do what thou art commanded to do. ” (Msb.) And sometimes it is divested of the conditional meaning, and becomes &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  لَو; as in the saying, صَلِّ وَاـِنٌ عَجَزْتَ عَنِ القِيَام [&lt;i&gt;Pray thou though thou be unable to stand;&lt;/i&gt;] i. e. &lt;i&gt;pray&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  &lt;pb n=&quot;107&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;thou whether thou be able to stand&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;unable to do so;&lt;/i&gt; and in the saying, اَكْرِمٌ زِيْدًا وَاـِنْ قَعَدَ i. e. [&lt;i&gt;Treat thou Zeyd with honour&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;though he be sitting;&lt;/i&gt; or, &lt;i&gt;whether he sit or not.&lt;/i&gt; (Msb.) [اـِمَّا as a compound of the conditional اـِنٌ and the redundant مَا, see in an art. of which اما is the heading.] ―         -b2-  [Secondly,] it is a negative, (S, Mughnee, K,) &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  مَا; (S;) and is put before a nominal proposition; (Mughnee, K;) as in the saying [in the Kur lxvii. 20], اـِنِ اْلْكَافِرُونَ <br>\
                  اـِلَّا فِى غُرُورٍ [&lt;i&gt;The unbelievers are not&lt;/i&gt; in aught &lt;i&gt;save in a deception&lt;/i&gt;]; (S, Mughnee, K;) and before a verbal proposition; as in [the Kur ix. 108,] اـِنْ اَرَدْنَا اـِلَّا اْلْحُسْنَى [&lt;i&gt;We desired not,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;meant not,&lt;/i&gt; aught &lt;i&gt;save that which is best&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee, K.) The assertion of some, that the negative اـِنٌ does not occur except where it is followed by اـِلَّا, as in the instances cited above, or by لَمَّا, with tesh-deed, which is syn. therewith, as, accord. to a reading of some of the Seven [Readers], in the saying [in the Kur lxxxvi. 4], اـِنْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ لَمَّا <br>\
                  عَلَيْهَا حَافِظٌ, i. e., مَا كُلُّ نَفْسٍ اـِلَّا عَلَيْهَا حَافِظٌ [&lt;i&gt;There is not any soul but over it is a guardian&lt;/i&gt;], is refuted by the sayings in the Kur [x. 69 and lxxii. 26], اـِنْ عِندَكُمْ مِنْ سُلْطَانٍ بِهٰذَا [meaning, accord. to the Jel., &lt;i&gt;Ye have no proof of this that&lt;/i&gt; ye say], and اـِنْ اَدْرِياَقَرِيبٌ مَا تُوعَدُونَ [&lt;i&gt;I know not whether that with which ye are threatened be nigh&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee, K. *) The conditional and the negative both occur in the saying in the Kur [xxxv. 39], وَلَيِنْ زَالَتَا اـِنْ اَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ اَحَدٍ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ [&lt;i&gt;And&lt;/i&gt; I swear that, &lt;i&gt;if they should quit their place, not any one should withhold them after Him&lt;/i&gt;]: the former is conditional; and the latter is negative, and is [part of] the complement of the oath which is denoted by the ل prefixed to the former; the complement of the condition being necessarily suppressed. (Mughnee.) When it is put before a nominal proposition, it has no government, accord. to Sb and Fr; but Ks and Mbr allow its governing in the manner of لَيْسَ; and Sa&#39;eed Ibn-Jubeyr reads, [in the Kur vii. 193,] اـِنِ اْلَّذِينَ <br>\
                  تَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اْللّٰهِ عِبَادًا اَمْثَالَكُمٌ [&lt;i&gt;Those whom ye invoke beside God,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;others than God, are not men like you&lt;/i&gt;]: also, the people of El-&#39;Áliyeh have been heard to say, اـِنٌ اَحَدٌ خَيْرًامِنْ اَحدٍ اـِلَّا <br>\
                  بِالعَافِيَةِ [&lt;i&gt;Any one is not better than any other one, except by means of health,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;soundness&lt;/i&gt;]; and اـِنْ ذٰلِكَ نَافِعَكَ وَلَا ضَارَّكَ [&lt;i&gt;That is not profitable to thee nor injurious to thee&lt;/i&gt;]: as an ex. of its occurrence without government, which is mostly the case, the saying of some, قَايمٌ ↓ <br>\
      اـِنَّ may be explained as originally اـِنٌ اَنَا قَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;I am not standing&lt;/i&gt;]; the ا of اَنَا being elided for no reason in itself, and the ن of اـِنٌ being incorporated into the ن of اَنَا, and the ا of this latter being elided in its conjunction with the following word; but اـِنَّ قَايِمًا has also been heard. (Mughnee.) Sometimes it occurs [as a negative] in the complement of an oath: you say, وَاْللّٰهِ اـِنٌ فَعَلْتُ, meaning مَا فَعَلْتُ [&lt;i&gt;By God, I did not&lt;/i&gt;]. (S.) ―         -b3-  [Thirdly,] it is a contraction of اـِنَّ, and is put before a nominal and before a verbal proposition. (Mughnee, K.) In the former case, it is made to govern and is made to have no government: (S, * K:) [i. e.] in this case, it is allowable to make it govern; contr. to the opinion of the Koofees: (Mughnee:) Lth says that he who uses the contracted form of اـِنَّ uses the nom. case with it, except that some of the people of El-Hijáz use the accus. case with it: (T:) thus it is said, accord. to one reading, [in the Kur xi. 113,] اـِنْ كُلَّا لَمَا <br>\
                  لَيُوَفِّيَنَّهُمٌ رَبُّكَ اَعْمَالَهُمٌ [&lt;i&gt;Verily all&lt;/i&gt; of them, &lt;i&gt;thy Lord will indeed fully render them&lt;/i&gt; the recompense of &lt;i&gt;their works&lt;/i&gt;]: (T, Mughnee:) Fr says, We have not heard the Arabs use the contracted form and make it to govern, unless with a pronoun, in which case the desinential syntax is not apparent; and he adds that in the instance cited above, they make كُلّا to be governed in the accus. case by ليوفّينّهم; as though the phrase were لَيُوَفِّيَنَّهُمْ <br>\
                  كُلَّا; and that كُلُّ would be proper; for you say, اـِنْ زَيْدٌ لَقَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;Verily Zeyd is standing&lt;/i&gt;]: (T:) the ex. given by Sb is, اـِنْ عَمْرًا لَمُنطَلِقٌ [&lt;i&gt;Verily &#39;Amr is going away&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee.) But it is [most] frequently made to have no government; as in the saying [in the Kur xliii. 34 accord. to one reading], وَاـِنْ كُلُّ ذٰلِكَ لَمَا مَتَاعُ <br>\
                  اْلْحَيَاةِ اْلدُّنْيَا [&lt;i&gt;And verily all that is the furniture of the present life&lt;/i&gt;]; and, accord. to the reading of Hafs, [and of &#39;Ásim and Kh, in the Kur xx. 66, respecting which see اـِنَّ,] اـِنْ هٰذَانِ لَسَاحِرَانِ [&lt;i&gt;Verily these two are enchanters&lt;/i&gt;]; &amp;amp;c. (Mughnee.) When it is put before a verbal proposition, it is necessarily made to have no government: (Mughnee, K:) and in most cases the verb is a preterite and of the kind called نَاسِخ [which effects a change of the grammatical form or of the meaning in a nominal proposition before which it is placed]; as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 138], وَاـِنْ كَانَتٌ لَكَبِيرَةً [&lt;i&gt;And verily it was a great matter&lt;/i&gt;]; and [in the Kur xvii. 75,] وَاـِنْ كَادُوا <br>\
                  لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ [&lt;i&gt;And verily they were near to seducing thee&lt;/i&gt;]; (Mughnee;) in which last ex. AZ says, it means لَقَدْ, i. e. &lt;i&gt;without doubt;&lt;/i&gt; and so in the same ch. vv. 78 and 108: (T:) less frequently it is an aor. of a verb of this kind; as in the saying [in the Kur xxvi. 186], وَاـِنْ نَظُنُّكَ لَمِنَ اْلْكَاذِبينَ [&lt;i&gt;And verily we think thee to be of the number of the liars&lt;/i&gt;]: and both these kinds of expression may be taken as exs. to be imitated: less frequently than this it is a preterite of a verb not of the kind termed نَسخ; as in the saying [of a poet], &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        شَلَّتٌ يَمِينُكَ اـِنٌ قَتَلْتَ لَمُسْلِمًا<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;May thy right arm,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;hand, dry up,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;become unsound! verily thou hast slain a Muslim&lt;/i&gt;]; but this may not be taken as an ex. to be imitated; contr. to the opinion of Akh; for he allows the phrase, اـِنْ قِامَ لَاَنَا [&lt;i&gt;Verily I stood&lt;/i&gt;], and اـِنٌ قَعَدَ لاَنْتَ [&lt;i&gt;Verily thou sattest&lt;/i&gt;]: and less frequently than this it is an aor. of a verb not of the kind termed ناسخ; as in the saying, اـِنْ يَزِينُكَ لَنَفْسُكَ وَاـِنٌ <br>\
                  يَشِينُكَ لَهِيَهٌ [&lt;i&gt;Verily thy soul&lt;/i&gt; is that which &lt;i&gt;beautifies thee, and it&lt;/i&gt; is that which &lt;i&gt;deforms thee&lt;/i&gt;]; and this, by common consent, may not be taken as an ex. to be imitated. (Mughnee.) Wherever you find اـِنٌ with لَ after it, decide that it is originally اـِنَّ; (Mughnee, K;) as in the exs. above: but respecting this ل there is a difference of opinion: see this letter. (Mughnee.) J says, (TA,) اـِنٌ is sometimes a contraction of اـِنَّ, and this must have ل put before its predicate, to compensate for what is elided, of the doubled letter; as in the saying in the Kur [lxxxvi. 4, accord. to him who reads لَمَا instead of لَمَّا], اـِنْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ لَمَا عَلَيْهَا حَافِظٌ [&lt;i&gt;Verily every soul hath over it a guardian&lt;/i&gt;]; and in the saying, اـِنٌ زَيدٌ لَاَخُوكَ [&lt;i&gt;Verily Zeyd is thy brother&lt;/i&gt;]; in order that it may not be confounded with اـِنٌ which is syn. with the negative مَا: (S, TA:) but IB says, ل is here introduced to distinguish between negation and affirmation, and this اـِنْ has neither subject nor predicate; so J&#39;s saying that the ل is put before its predicate is without meaning: and this ل is sometimes introduced with the objective complement of a verb; as in اـِنْ ضَرَبْتُ <br>\
                  لَزَيْدًا [&lt;i&gt;Verily I struck,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;beat, Zeyd&lt;/i&gt;]; and with the agent; as in اـِنْ قَامَ لَزَيْدٌ [&lt;i&gt;Verily Zeyd stood&lt;/i&gt;]. (TA.) When the contracted اـِنْ governs, this ل is not necessary; so you may say, اـِنْ زَيْدًا قَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;Verily Zeyd is standing&lt;/i&gt;]; because in this case it cannot be confounded with the negative; for the negative does not render the subject mansoob and the predicate marfooa: and when it does not govern, if the meaning is apparent, the ل is not needed; as in &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        وَنَحْنُ اُبَاةُ الضَّيْمِ مِنْ ا=لِ مَالِكٍ<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        وَاـِنْ مَالِكٌ كَانَتْ كِرَامَ المَعَادِنِ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;And we are persons who refuse to submit to injury, of the family of Málik: and verily&lt;/i&gt; the family of &lt;i&gt;Málik are generous in respect of&lt;/i&gt; their &lt;i&gt;origins&lt;/i&gt;]; كَانَتْ being here for لَكَانَتٌ. (I &#39;Ak p. 99.) ―         -b4-  [Fourthly,] it is redundant, (S, Mughnee, K,) occurring with مَا; as in the saying, مَا اـِنْ يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ [&lt;i&gt;Zeyd does not stand&lt;/i&gt;]; (S;) and in the saying [of a poet], &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        كَا اـِنْ اَتَيْتَ بِشْىءٍ اَنْتَ تَكْرَهُهُ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Thou didst not a thing which thou dislikest&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee, K: in the CK اَتْتُ.) It is mostly thus used after the negative ما, when put before a verbal proposition; as above; or before a nominal proposition; as in the saying, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        مَنَايَانَا وَدَوْلَةُ ا=خَرِينَا <br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        وَمَا اـِنْ طِبُّنَا جبُنٌ ولٰكِنٌ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;And our habit is not cowardice; but our destinies and the good fortune of others&lt;/i&gt; caused our being defeated]: and in this case it prevents the government of ما, as in this verse: but in the saying, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        بَنِى غُدَانَةَ مَا اـِنْ اَنْتُمُ ذَهَبًا<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        وَلَا صَرِيفًا وَلٰكِنٌ اَنْتُمُ الخَزَفُ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Sons of Ghudáneh, ye are not indeed gold, nor silver,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;pure silver, but ye are pottery&lt;/i&gt;], accord. to him who relates it thus, saying ذهبًا and صريفًا, in the accus. case, it is explained as a negative, corroborative of ما: (Mughnee:) and accord. to J, &lt;pb n=&quot;108&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; (TA,) the negatives مَا and اـِنٌ are sometimes thus combined for corroboration; as in the saying of the rájiz, (El-Aghlab El-&#39;Ijlee, TA,) &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اَكْثَرَ مِنْهُ قِرَةً وَقَارَا <br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        مَا اـِنٌ رَاَيْنَا مَلِكَّا اَغَارَا<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;We have not indeed seen a king who has made a hostile incursion possessing more numerous sheep,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;goats, and camels, than he&lt;/i&gt;]; (S, TA;) but IB says that ان is here redundant, not a negative. (TA.) Sometimes it is redundant after the conjunct noun مَا; as in the saying, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        يُرَجِىّ المَرْاـُ مَا اـِنٌ لَا يَرَاهُ<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        وَتَعْرِضُ دُونَ اَدْنَاهُ الخُطُوبُ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Man hopes for that which he will not see; for calamities intervene as obstacles in the way to what is nearest thereof&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee.) And after the مَا termed مَصْدَرِيَّة, (Mughnee,) [i. e.,] after the adverbial مَا [which is of the kind termed مصدريّة]; (TA;) as in the saying (of Maaloot El-Kurey&#39;ee, cited by Sb, TA), &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        وَرَجِّ الفَتَى لِلْخَيْرِ مَا اـِنْ رَاَيْتَهُ<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        عَلَي السِّنِّ خَيْرًا لَايَزَالُ يَزِيدُ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;And hope thou that the youth is&lt;/i&gt; destined &lt;i&gt;for good as long as thou hast seen him not ceasing to increase in good with age&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee.) And after the inceptive اَلَا; as in the saying, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اَلَا اـِنْ سَرَى لَيْلِى فبِتُّ كَيِيبَا<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اُحَاذِرُ اَنْ تَنْاَى النَّوَى بِغَضُوبَا<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Now he journeyed on,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;during,&lt;/i&gt; that &lt;i&gt;my night, and I passed the night in an evil state, broken in spirit by grief, being fearful that the distance&lt;/i&gt; to which he was going &lt;i&gt;with Ghadoob&lt;/i&gt; (a woman so named) &lt;i&gt;would become far&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee.) And before the meddeh denoting disapproval: [for] Sb heard a man, on its being said to him, “ Wilt thou go forth if the desert become plentiful in herbage? ” reply, اَاَنَا اـِنِيهٌ [&lt;i&gt;What, I, indeed?&lt;/i&gt;] disapproving that he should think otherwise than that. (Mughnee. [See also art. انى.]) ―         -b5-  [Fifthly,] it is &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  قَدْ: so it is said to be in the saying [in the Kur lxxxvii. 9], اـِنْ نَفَعَتِ اْلذِّكْرَى [&lt;i&gt;Admonition hath profited&lt;/i&gt;], (T, Mughnee, K,) by IAar (T) and by Ktr: (Mughnee:) and Abu-l-&#39; Abbás relates that the Arabs say, اـِنٌ نَفَعَتِ اْلذِّكْرَى meaning قَدْقَامَ زَيْدٌ [&lt;i&gt;Zeyd has stood&lt;/i&gt;]; and he adds, that Ks states his having heard them say so, and having thought that it expressed a condition, but that he asked them, and they answered that they meant قَدْقَامَ زَيْدٌ, and not مَا قَامَ زَيْدٌ. (T.) [So too, accord. to the K, in all the exs. cited in the next sentence as from the Mughnee; but this is evidently a mistake, occasioned by an accidental omission.] ―         -b6-  [Sixthly,] it is asserted also by the Koofees, that it is &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  اـِذْ, in the following exs.: in the Kur [v. 62], وَاْتَّقُوا اْللّٰهَ اـِنٌ كُنْتُمْ <br>\
                  مُوْمِنِينَ [&lt;i&gt;And fear ye God, because ye are believers:&lt;/i&gt; and so, accord. to AZ, as is said in the T, in a similar instance in the Kur ii. 278: and in the same, iv. 62]: and [in the Kur xlviii. 27,] لَتَدْ خُلُنَّ اْلمَسْجِدَ اْلْحَرَامَ اـِنْ شَا=ءَ ا=مِنِينَ [&lt;i&gt;Ye shall assuredly enter the sacred mosque, because God hath willed, in security&lt;/i&gt;]: and in like instances, when the verb therein expresses what is held sure to happen or to have happened: and in the saying, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اَتَغْضَبُ اـِنٌ اُدْنَا قُتَيْبَةَ حُزَّتَا<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        جِهَارًا وَلَمْ تَغْضَبْ لِقَتْلِ اْبْنِ حَازِمِ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Art thou angry because the ears of Kuteybeh have been cut, openly,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;publicly, and wast not angry for the slaughter of Ibn-Házim?&lt;/i&gt;]: (Mughnee:) but in all these instances [it is sufficiently obvious that] ان may be otherwise explained. (Mughnee, K.) ―         -b7-  [Seventhly,] it is sometimes &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  اـِذَا; as in the Kur [ix. 23], لَا تَتَّخِذُوا <br>\
                  ا=بَا=ءَكُمْ وَاـِخْوَانَكُمْ اَوْلِيَا=ءَ اـِنِ اْسْتَحَبُّوا اْلْكُفْرَعَلَى <br>\
                  اْلْاـِيمَانِ [&lt;i&gt;Take not ye your fathers and your brethren as friends when they love unbelief above belief&lt;/i&gt;]; and in the same [xxxiii. 49], وَاْمْرَاَةً مُوْمِنَةً <br>\

(T.) ―         -b8-  [Eighthly,] it is used for اـِمَّا, (Mughnee and K, voce اـِمَّا,) distinct from اـِمَّا which is a compound of the conditional اـِنٌ and the redundant مَا. (Mughnee ibid.)

                  &lt;/form&gt; is one of the particles which annul the quality of the inchoative; and is originally اـِنَّ; therefore Sb has not mentioned it among those particles [as distinct from اـِنَّ, from which, however, it is distinguished in meaning]: (I &#39;Ak p. 90:) it is a corroborative particle; (I &#39;Ak, Mughnee;) a particle governing the subject in the accus. case and the predicate in the nom. case, (S, I &#39;Ak, Mughnee, K,) combining with what follows it to form an equivalent to an inf. n., (S,) [for,] accord. to the most correct opinion, it is a conjunct particle, which, together with its two objects of government, is explained by means of an inf. n. (Mughnee.) If the predicate is derived, the inf. n. by means of which it is explained is of the same radical letters; so that the implied meaning of بَلَغَنِي اَنَّكَ تَنْطَلِقُ [&lt;i&gt;It has come to my knowledge,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;been related to me,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;been told to me,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;it came to my knowledge,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c., &lt;i&gt;that thou goest away&lt;/i&gt;], or اَنَّكَ مُنْطَلِقٌ [&lt;i&gt;that thou art going away&lt;/i&gt;], is بَلَغَنِي الاِنْطِلَاقُ [or rather اْنْطِلَاقُكَ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;thy going away has come to my knowledge,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.]; and hence, the implied meaning of بَلَغَنِى اَنَّكَ فِي <br>\
                  الدَّارِ [&lt;i&gt;It has come to my knowledge,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c., &lt;i&gt;that thou art in the house&lt;/i&gt;] is بَلَغَنِى اْسْتِقْرَارُكَ فِي الدَّارِ [&lt;i&gt;thy remaining in the house has come to my knowledge,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.], because thea predicate is properly a word suppressed from اِستَقَرَّ or مُسْتَقِرٌّ: and if the predicate is underived, the implied meaning is explained by the word كَوْنِ; so that the implied meaning of بَلَغَنِى اَنَّ هٰذا زَيْدٌ [&lt;i&gt;It has come to my knowledge,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c., &lt;i&gt;that this is Zeyd&lt;/i&gt;] is بَلَغَنِى <br>\
                  كَوْنُهُ زَيْدًا [&lt;i&gt;his being Zeyd has come to my knowledge,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.]; for the relation of every predicate expressed by an underived word to its subject may be denoted by a word signifying “ being; ” so that you say, هٰذَا زَيْدٌ and, if you will, هٰذَا <br>\
                  كَايِنٌ زَيْدًا; both signifying the same. (Mughnee.) There are cases in which either اَنَّ or اـِنَّ may be used: [see the latter, in twelve places:] other cases in which only the former may be used: and others in which only the latter. (I &#39;Ak p. 91.) The former only may be used when the implied meaning is to be explained by an inf. n. (I &#39;Ak, K.) Such is the case when it occurs in the place of a noun governed by a verb in the nom. case; as in يُعْجِبُنِى اَنَّكَ قَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;It pleases me that thou art standing&lt;/i&gt;], i. e. قِيَامُكَ [&lt;i&gt;thy standing&lt;/i&gt; pleases me]: or in the place of a noun governed by a verb in the accus. case; as in عَرَفْتُ اَتَّكَ قَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;I knew that thou wast standing&lt;/i&gt;], i. e. قِيَامَكَ [&lt;i&gt;thy standing&lt;/i&gt;]: or in the place of a noun governed in the gen. case by a particle; as in عَجِبْتُ مِنْ اَنَّكَ قَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;I wondered that thou wast standing&lt;/i&gt;], i. e. مِنْ قِيَامكَ [&lt;i&gt;at,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;by reason of, thy standing&lt;/i&gt;]: (I &#39;Ak p. 91:) [and sometimes a preposition is understood; as in لَا شَكَّ اَنَّهُ كَذَا, for لَا شَكَّ فِى اَنَّهُ كَذَا <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;There is no doubt that it is thus,&lt;/i&gt; i. e. لَا شّكَّ فِى كَوْنِهِ كَذَا <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;There is no doubt of its being thus:&lt;/i&gt;] and اَنَّ must be used after لَوْ; as in لَوْ اَنَّكَ قَايِمٌ لَقُمْتُ [&lt;i&gt;If that thou wert standing, I had stood,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;would have stood,&lt;/i&gt; i. e. لَوْ ثَبَتَ قِيَامُكَ, or لَوْ قِيَامُكَ ثَابِتٌ, accord. to different opinions, both meaning &lt;i&gt;if thy standing were a fact:&lt;/i&gt; see I &#39;Ak pp. 305 and 306]. (K.) Sometimes its ا is changed into ع; so that you say, عَلِمْتُ عَنَّكَ مُنْطَلِقٌ [meaning &lt;i&gt;I knew that thou wast going away&lt;/i&gt;]. (M.) ―         -b2-  With ك prefixed to it, it is a particle of comparison, (S, * M, TA,) [still] governing the subject in the accus. case and the predicate in the nom. case: (TA:) you say, كَاَنَّ زَيْدًا عَمْرٌو [It is &lt;i&gt;as though Zeyd were &#39;Amr&lt;/i&gt;], meaning that Zeyd is like &#39;Amr; as though you said, اـِنَّ زَيْدًا كَايِنٌ كَعَمْرٍو [&lt;i&gt;verily, Zeyd is like &#39;Amr&lt;/i&gt;]: [it is to be accounted for by an ellipsis: or] the ك is taken away from the middle of this proposition, and put at its commencement, and then the kesreh of اـِنَّ necessarily becomes changed to a fet-hah, because اـِنَّ cannot be preceded by a preposition, for it never occurs but at the commencement [of a proposition]. (IJ, M.) Sometimes, كَاَنَّ denotes denial; as in the saying, كَاَنَّكَ اَمِيرُنَا فَتَاْمُرَنَا [&lt;i&gt;As though thou wert our commander so that thou shouldst command us&lt;/i&gt;], meaning &lt;i&gt;thou art not our commander&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;that thou shouldst command us&lt;/i&gt;]. (TA.) It also denotes wishing; as in the saying, كَاْنَّكَ بِي قَدْ <br>\
                  قُلْتُ الشِّعْرَ فَاُجِيدَهُ, meaning &lt;i&gt;Would that I had poetized,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;versified, so that I might do it well:&lt;/i&gt; (TA:) [an elliptical form of speech, of which the implied meaning seems to be, &lt;i&gt;would that I were as though thou sawest me that I had poetized,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.; or the like: for] you say [also], كَاَنِّى بِكَ meaning كَاَنِّى اَبْصُرُ بِكَ [It is &lt;i&gt;as though I saw thee&lt;/i&gt;]; i. e. I know from what I witness of thy condition to-day how thy condition will be tomorrow; so that it is as though I saw thee in that condition: (Har p. 126: [see also بِ; near &lt;pb n=&quot;109&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; the end of the paragraph:]) [thus,] كَاَنَّ also denotes knowing; and also thinking; [the former as in the saying immediately preceding, and] as when you say, كَاَنَّ اْللّٰهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشَا=ءُ [&lt;i&gt;I know,&lt;/i&gt; or rather &lt;i&gt;it appears, as though seen, that God does what He wills&lt;/i&gt;]; and [the latter as when you say,] كَاَنَّكَ خَارِجٌ [&lt;i&gt;I think,&lt;/i&gt; or rather &lt;i&gt;it seems, that Thou art going forth&lt;/i&gt;]. (TA.) ―         -b3-  [When it has The affixed pronoun of the first person, sing. Or Pl., you say, اَنِّى and اَنَّنِى, and اَنَّا and اَنَّنَا: and When it has also the ك of comparison prefixed to It,] you say, كَاَنِّى and كَاَنَّنِى, [and كَاَنَّا and كَاَنَّنَا,] like as you say, لٰكِنِّى and لٰكِنَّنِى [&amp;amp;c.]. (S.) ―         -b4-  As اَنَّ is a derivative from اـِنَّ, it is correctly asserted by Z that اَنَّمَا imports restriction, like ↓ <br>\
      اـِنَّمَا; both of which occur in the saying in the Kur [xxi. 108], يُوحَى اـِلَىَّ اَنَّمَا ↓ <br>\
      قُلْ اـِنَّمَا <br>\
                  اـِلٰهُكُمْ اـِلٰهً وَاحِدٌ [&lt;i&gt;Say thou, It is only revealed to me that your God is only one God&lt;/i&gt;]: the former is for the restricting of the quality to the qualified; and the latter, for the reverse: (Mughnee, K:) i. e. the former is for the restricting of the revelation to the declaration of the unity; and the latter, for the restricting of “ your God ” to unity: (Marginal note in a copy of the Mughnee:) but these words of the Kur do not imply that nothing save the unity was revealed to the Prophet; for the restriction is limited to the case of the discourse with the believers in a plurality of gods; so that the meaning is, there has not been revealed to me [aught], respecting the godhead, except the unity; not the attribution of any associate to God. (Mughnee.) [اَنَّمَا, however, does not always import restriction; nor does always even ↓ <br>\
      اـِنَّمَا: in each of these, ما is what is termed كَافَّةٌ; i. e., it restricts the particle to which it is affixed from exercising any government; and sometimes has no effect upon the signification of that particle: (see art. مَا; and see اـِنَّمَا, below, voce اـِنَّ:) thus, for instance, in the Kur viii. 28, وَاْعْلَمُوا اَنَّمَا <br>\
                  اَمْوَالُكُمْ فِتْنَةً means &lt;i&gt;And know ye that your possessions and your children are a trial;&lt;/i&gt; not that they are &lt;i&gt;only a trial.&lt;/i&gt; When it has the ك of comparison prefixed to it, it is sometimes contracted; as in the following ex.:] a poet says, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        كَاَمَّا يَخْتَطِينَ عَشلَى قَتَادٍ<br>\

                        وَيَسْتَضْحِكْنَ عَنْ حَبِّ الغَمَامِ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;As though,&lt;/i&gt; by reason of their mincing gait, &lt;i&gt;they were walking upon tragacanthas; and they were laughing so as to discover teeth like hailstones&lt;/i&gt;: كَاَمَّا being for كَاَنَّمَا. (IAar.) ―         -b5-  اَنَّ is someTimes contracted into اَنْ; (S, Mughnee;) and in This case, it governs in the manner already exPlained, voce اَنْ. (Mughnee.) ―         -b6-  It is also &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  لَعَلَّ; (Sb, S, M, Mughnee, K;) as in the saying, اِيتِ السُّوقَ اَنَّكَ تَشْتَرِى لَنَا شَيْيًا [&lt;i&gt;Come thou to the market; may-be thou wilt buy for us something;&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  اِيتِ being originally اِيْتِ]; i. e. لَعَلَّكَ: (Sb, M, Mughnee, K: *) and, accord. to some, (M, Mughnee, K,) so in the Kur [vi. 109], where it is said, وَمَا يُشْعِرُكُمْ اَنَّهَا اـِذَا جَا=ءَتْ لَا يُوْمِنُونَ [&lt;i&gt;And what maketh you to know?&lt;/i&gt; (meaning, maketh you to know that they will believe when it cometh? i. e. ye do not know that: Jel:) &lt;i&gt;Maybe, when it cometh, they will not believe&lt;/i&gt;]: (S, M, Mughnee, K:) thus accord. to this reading: (Mughnee, K:) and Ubeí here reads لَعَلَّهَا. (S.) اَنَّ and لَاَنَّ and لَوْ اَنَّ are all &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  عَلَّ and لَعَلَّ; and اَنِّى and اَنَّنِى, and لَاَنِّى and لاَنَّنِى, and لُوْ اَنِّى and لَوْ اَنِّنِى, with عَلِّى and لَعَلِّى. (K voce لَعَلَّ.) ―         -b7-  It is also syn. with اَجَلْ [&lt;i&gt;Yes,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;yea;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;it is as thou sayest&lt;/i&gt;]. (M, TA.) [See also اـِنَّ as exemplified by a verse commencing with وَيَقُلْنَ and by a saying of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr.]    &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\

                  &lt;/form&gt; is one of the particles which annul the quality of the inchoative, like اَنَّ, of which it is the original: (I &#39;Ak p. 90:) it is a corroborative particle, (I &#39;Ak, Mughnee,) corroborating the predicate; (S, K;) governing the subject in the accus. case and the predicate in the nom. case; (S, I &#39;Ak, Mughnee, K;) [and may generally be rendered by &lt;i&gt;Verily,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;certainly,&lt;/i&gt; or the like; exactly agreeing with the Greek        <br>\
      &lt;orth lang=&quot;gr&quot;&gt;ὃτι&lt;/orth&gt;, as used in Luke vii. 16 and in many other passages in the New Testament; though it often seems to be nothing more than a sign of inception, which can hardly be rendered at all in English; unless in pronunciation, by laying a stress upon the predicate, or upon the copula;] as in the saying, اـِنَّ زَيْدًا قَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;Verily,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;certainly, Zeyd is standing;&lt;/i&gt; or simply, &lt;i&gt;Zeyd is standing,&lt;/i&gt; if we lay a stress upon &lt;i&gt;standing,&lt;/i&gt; or upon is]. (I &#39;Ak p. 90.) But sometimes it governs both the subject and the predicate in the accus. case; as in the saying, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اـِذَا اْشْتَدَّ جُنْحُ اللَّيْلِ فَلْتَاْتِ وَلْتَكُنٌ<br>\

                        خُطَاكَ خِفَافًا اـِنَّ حُرَّاسَنَا اُسْدَا<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;When the darkness of night becomes,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;shall become, intense, then do thou come, and let thy steps be light: verily our guardians are lions&lt;/i&gt;]; (Mughnee, K; [but in the latter, for اْشْتَدَّ, we find اْسْوَدَّ, so that the meaning is, &lt;i&gt;when the first portion of the night becomes,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;shall become, black,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.;]) and as in a trad. in which it is said, انَّ قَعْرَ جَهَنَّمَ سَبْعِينَ خَرِيفًا [&lt;i&gt;Verily the bottom of Hell is&lt;/i&gt; a distance of &lt;i&gt;seventy years&lt;/i&gt; of journeying]: (Mughnee, K:) the verse, however, is explained by the supposition that it presents a denotative of state [in the last word, which is equivalent to شِجْعَانًا or the like], and that the predicate is suppressed, the meaning being, تَلْقَاهُمْ اُسْدًا [&lt;i&gt;thou wilt find them lions&lt;/i&gt;]; and the trad. by the supposition that قَعْرَ is an inf. n., and سَبْعِينَ is an adverbial noun, so that the meaning is, &lt;i&gt;the reaching the bottom of hell is&lt;/i&gt; [to be accomplished in no less time than] &lt;i&gt;in seventy years.&lt;/i&gt; (Mughnee.) And sometimes the inchoative [of a proposition] after it is in the nom. case, and its subject is what is termed ضَمِيرُ شَاْنٍ, suppressed; as in the saying of Mohammad, اـِنَّ مِنْ اَشَدِّ النَّاسِ عَذَابًا يَوْمَ القِيٰمَةِ <br>\
                  المُصَوِّرُونَ [&lt;i&gt;Verily,&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;the case is&lt;/i&gt; this:) &lt;i&gt;of the men most severely to be punished, on the day of resurrection, are the makers of images&lt;/i&gt;], originally اـِنَّهُ, i. e. اـِنَّ الشَّاْنَ; (Mughnee, K; *) and as in the saying in the Kur [xx. 66], اـِنَّ هٰذَانِ لَسَاحِرَانِ, [accord. to some,] as will be seen in what follows. (TA.) ―         -b2-  Of the two particles اـِنَّ and ↓ <br>\
      اَنَّ, in certain cases only the former may be used; and in certain other cases either of them may be used. (I&#39; Ak p. 91.) The former must be used when it occurs inceptively, (Kh, T, I&#39; Ak p. 92, Mughnee, K,) having nothing before it upon which it is syntactically dependent, (Kh, T,) with respect to the wording or the meaning; (K;) as in اـِنَّ زَيْدًا قَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;Verily Zeyd is standing&lt;/i&gt;]. (I&#39; Ak, K.) It is used after اَلَا, (I&#39; Ak, K,) the inceptive particle, (I&#39; Ak,) or the particle which is employed to give notice [of something about to be said]; (K;) as in اَلَا اـِنَّ <br>\
                  زَيْدًا قَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;Now surely Zeyd is standing&lt;/i&gt;]. (I&#39; Ak K.) And when it occurs at the commencement of the complement of a conjunct noun; (I&#39; Ak, K; *) as in جَا=ءَ الَّذِى اـِنَّهُ قَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;He who is standing came&lt;/i&gt;]; (I&#39; Ak;) and in the Kur [xxviii. 76], وَا=تَيْنَاهُ مِنَ اْلْكُنُورِ مَا اـِنَّ مَفَاتِحَهُ لَتَنُوْءُ بِاْلْعُصْبَةِ اُولِى <br>\
                  القُوَّةِ [&lt;i&gt;And we gave him, of treasures, that whereof the keys would weigh down the company of men possessed of strength&lt;/i&gt;]. (I&#39; Ak, * K, * TA.) And in the complement of an oath, (I&#39; Ak, K,) when its predicate has لَ, (I&#39; Ak,) or whether its subject or its predicate has لَ or has it not; (K;) as in وَاْللّٰهِ اـِنَّ زَيْدًا لَقَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;By Allah, verily Zeyd is standing&lt;/i&gt;], (I&#39; Ak,) and اـِنَّهُ قَايِمٌ: or, as some say, when you do not employ the ل, the particle is with fet-h; as in قَايِمٌ ↓ <br>\
      وَاْللّٰهِ اَنَّكَ [I swear &lt;i&gt;by Allah that thou art standing&lt;/i&gt;]; mentioned by Ks as thus heard by him from the Arabs: (TA:) but respecting this case we shall have to speak hereafter. (I&#39; Ak.) And when it occurs after the word قَوْلٌ or a derivative thereof, in repeating the saying to which that word relates; (Fr, T, I&#39; Ak, * K; *) as in the saying [in the Kur iv. 156], وَقَوْلِهِمْ اـِنَّا قَتَلْنَا اْلْمَسِيحَ [&lt;i&gt;And their saying, Verily we have slain the Messiah&lt;/i&gt;]; (Fr, T;) and قُلْتُ <br>\
                  اـِنَّ زَيْدًا قَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;I said, Verily Zeyd is standing&lt;/i&gt;]; (I&#39; Ak;) and [in the Kur v. 115,] قَالَ اْللّٰهُ اـِنّى <br>\
                  مُنّزِّلُهَا عَلَيْكُمْ [&lt;i&gt;God said, Verily I will cause it to descend unto you&lt;/i&gt;]; accord. to the dial. of him who does not pronounce it with fet-h: (K:) but when it occurs in explaining what is said, you use ↓ <br>\
      اَنَّ; as in the saying, قَدْ قُلْتُ لَكَ كَلَامًا حَسَنًا <br>\
                  اَنَّ اَبَاكَ شَرِيفٌ وَاَنَّكَ عَاقِلٌ [&lt;i&gt;I have said to thee a good saying; that thy father is noble and that thou art intelligent&lt;/i&gt;]; (Fr, T;) or when the word signifying “ saying ” is used as meaning “ thinking; ” as in اَتَقُولُ اَنَّ زَيْدًا قَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;Dost thou say that Zeyd is standing?&lt;/i&gt;], meaning اَتَظُنُّ [&lt;i&gt;Dost thou think?&lt;/i&gt;]. (I&#39; Ak.) Also, when it occurs in a phrase denotative of state; (I&#39; Ak;) [i. e.,] after the و denotative of state; (K;) as in زُرْتُهُ وَاـِنِّى <br>\
                  ذُواَمَلٍ [&lt;i&gt;I visited him, I verily having hope,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;expectation&lt;/i&gt;]; (I&#39; Ak;) and in جَا=ءَ زِيْدٌ وَ اـِنَّ يَدَهُ <br>\
                  عَلَى رَاْسِهِ [&lt;i&gt;Zeyd came, he verily having his hand upon his head&lt;/i&gt;]. (K.) And when it occurs in a phrase which is the predicate of a proper (as &lt;pb n=&quot;110&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; opposed to an ideal) substantive; (I&#39; Ak, K; *) as in زَيْدٌ اـِنَّهُ قَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;Zeyd, verily he is standing&lt;/i&gt;], (I&#39; Ak,) or ذَاهِبٌ [&lt;i&gt;going away&lt;/i&gt;]; contr. to the assertion of Fr. (K.) And when it occurs before the ل which suspends the grammatical government of a verb of the mind, preceding it, with respect to its objective complements; (I&#39; Ak, K; *) as in عَلِمْتُ اـِنَّ زَيْدًا لَقَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;I knew Zeyd verily was standing&lt;/i&gt;]; (I&#39; Ak;) and in [the Kur lxiii. 1,] وَاْللّٰهُ يَعْلَمُ اـِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ [&lt;i&gt;And God knoweth thou verily art his apostle&lt;/i&gt;]: (K:) but if the ل is not in its predicate, you say, ↓ <br>\
      اَنَّ; as in عَلِمْتُ اَنَّ <br>\
                  زَيْدًا قَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;I knew that Zeyd was standing&lt;/i&gt;]. (I&#39; Ak.) And in the like of the saying in the Kur [ii. 171], وَاـِنَّ اْلَّذِينَ اْخْتَلَفُوا فِى اْلْكِتَابِ لَفِى شَقَاقٍ <br>\
                  بَعِيدٍ [&lt;i&gt;And verily they who differ among themselves respecting the book are in an opposition remote&lt;/i&gt; from the truth]; because of the ل [of inception] which occurs after it, in لَفِى: (Ks, A &#39;Obeyd:) the ل of inception which occurs before the predicate of اـِنَّ should properly commence the sentence; so that اـِنَّ زَيْدًا لَقَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;Verily Zeyd is standing&lt;/i&gt;] should properly be لَاـِنَّ زَيْدًا قَايِمٌ; but as the ل is a corroborative and اـِنَّ is a corroborative, they dislike putting two particles of the same meaning together, and therefore they put the ل later, transferring it to the predicate: Mbr allows its being put before the predicate of ↓ <br>\
      اَنَّ; and thus it occurs in an unusual reading of the saying [in the Kur xxv. 22], اـِلَّا اَنَّهُمْ لَيَاْكُلُونَ اْلطَّعَامَ [&lt;i&gt;But they ate food&lt;/i&gt;]; but this is explained by the supposition that the ل is here redundant: (I&#39; Ak p. 95:) this is the reading of Sa&#39;eed Ibn-Jubeyr: others read, اـِلَّا اـِنَّهُمْ لَيَاْكُلُنَ الطَّعَامَ [&lt;i&gt;but verily they ate food&lt;/i&gt;]: and اـِنَّ [as well as ↓ <br>\
      اَنَّ] is used after the exceptive اـِلَّا when it is not followed by the ل [of inception]. (TA.) Also, When it occurs after حَيْثُ; as in اِجْلِسْ حَيْثُ اـِنَّ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ [&lt;i&gt;Sit thou where Zeyd is sitting&lt;/i&gt;]. (I&#39; Ak p. 92, and k) And after حَتَّى; as in مَرِضَ زَيْدٌ حَتَّى اـِنَّهُمْ لَا يَرْجُونَهُ [&lt;i&gt;Zeyd has fallen sick, so that verily they have no hope for him&lt;/i&gt;: whereas after a particle governing the gen. case, [i. e. a preposition,] you say, ↓ <br>\
      اَنَّ. (IHsh in De Sacy&#39;s Anthol. Gr. Ar. P. 76.) ―         -b3-  Either of these two forms may be used after اـِذَا denoting a thing&#39;s happening suddenly, or unexpectedly; as in خَرَجْتُ فَاـِذَا اـِنَّ زَيْدًاقَايِمٌ [&lt;i&gt;I went forth, and lo, verily Zeyd was standing&lt;/i&gt;], and زَيْدًا قَايِمٌ ↓ <br>\
      فَاـِذَا اَنَّ [&lt;i&gt;and lo,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;at that present time, Zeyd&#39;s standing&lt;/i&gt;]; in which latter case, اَنَّ with its complement is [properly] an inchoative, and its enunciative is اـِذَا; the implied meaning being, &lt;i&gt;and at that present time&lt;/i&gt; was &lt;i&gt;the standing of Zeyd:&lt;/i&gt; or it may be that the enunciative is suppressed, and that the implied meaning is, [&lt;i&gt;and lo,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;at that present time,&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;the standing of Zeyd&lt;/i&gt; was an event come to pass. (I&#39; Ak p. 93.) Also, when occurring in the complement of an oath, if its enunciative is without ل: (I&#39; Ak:) [see exs. given above:] or, as some say, only ↓ <br>\
      اَنَّ is used in this case. (TA.) Also, when occurring after فَ denoting the complement of a condition; as in مَنْ يَاْتِنِى فَاـِنَّهُ مُكْرَمٌ [&lt;i&gt;He who cometh to me, verily he shall be treated with honour&lt;/i&gt;], and مُكْرَمٌ ↓ <br>\
      اَنَّهُ; in which latter case, اَنَّ with its complement is an inchoative, and the enunciative is suppressed; the implied meaning being, &lt;i&gt;honourable treatment of him&lt;/i&gt; shall be an event come to pass: or it may be an enunciative to an inchoative suppressed; the implied meaning being, his recompense shall be &lt;i&gt;honourable treatment.&lt;/i&gt; (I&#39; Ak p. 94.) Also, when occurring after an inchoative having the meaning of a saying, its enunciative being a saying, and the sayer being one; as in خَيْرُ القَوْلِ اـِنّى اَحْمَدُ [&lt;i&gt;The best saying is, Verily I praise&lt;/i&gt; God], and اَحْمَدُ ↓ <br>\
      اَنِّى; in which latter case, اَنَّ with its complement is an enunciative of خَيْرُ; the implied meaning being, &lt;i&gt;the best saying is the praising&lt;/i&gt; of God [or &lt;i&gt;my praising&lt;/i&gt; of God]. (I&#39; Ak ubi suprà.) You also say, لَبَّيْكَ اـِنَّ الحَمْدَلَكَ [&lt;i&gt;At thy service ! Verily praise belongeth to Thee!&lt;/i&gt; O God]; commencing [with اـِنَّ] a new proposition: and sometimes one says, ↓ <br>\
      اَنَّ; meaning بِاَنَّ الحَمْدَ لَكَ [&lt;i&gt;because praise belongeth to Thee&lt;/i&gt;]. (Msb.) ―         -b4-  The cases in which اـِن may not be used in the place of اَنَّ have been mentioned above, voce اَنَّ. ―         -b5-  [When it has the affixed pronoun of the first person, sing. or pl.,] you say, اـِنِّى and اـِنَّنِى, (S,) and اـِنَّا and اـِنَّنَا, (TA,) like as you say لٰكِنِّى and لٰكِنِّنِى [&amp;amp;c.]. (S.) اـِنَّ as a contraction of اـِنَّ اَنَا has been mentioned above, as occurring in the phrase اـِنَّ قَايِمٌ, voce اـِنْ, q. v. ―         -b6-  Accord. to the grammarians, (T,) اـِنَّمَا is a compound of اـِنَّ and مَا, (T, S,) which latter prevents the former&#39;s having any government: (T:) it imports restriction; like اَنَّمَا, which see above, voce اَنَّ, in three places: (Mughnee, K:) [i. e.] it imports the restriction of that which it precedes to that which follows it; as in اـِنَّمَا زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ [&lt;i&gt;Zeyd is only going away&lt;/i&gt;], and اـِنَّمَا يَنْطَلِقُ زَيْدٌ [&lt;i&gt;Only Zeyd goes away&lt;/i&gt;]: (Bd in ii. 10:) [in other words,] it is used to particularize, or specify, or distinguish a thing from other things: (S:) it affirms a thing in relation to that which is mentioned after it, and denies it in relation to other things; (T, S;) as in the saying in the Kur [ix. 60], اـِنَّمَا اْلصَّدَقَاتُ <br>\
                  لِلْفُقَرَا=ءِ [&lt;i&gt;The contributions levied for pious uses are only,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;but, for the poor&lt;/i&gt;]: (S:) but El- Ámidee and AHei say that it does not import restriction, but only corroboration of an affirmation, because it is a compound of the corroborative اـِنَّ and the redundant مَا which restrains the former from exercising government, and that it has no application to denote negation implied in restriction, as is shown by the trad., اـِنَّمَا الِّرِبَا فِى <br>\
                  النَّسِيْيَةِ [which must mean, &lt;i&gt;Verily usury is in the delay of payment&lt;/i&gt;], for usury is in other things beside that here mentioned, as رِبَا الفضْلِ [or profit obtained by the superior value of a thing received over that of a thing given], by common consent: (Kull p. 76:) some say that it necessarily imports restriction: J says what has been cited above from the S: some say that it has an overt signification in denoting restriction, and is susceptible of the meaning of corroboration: some say the reverse of this: El-Ámidee says that if it were [properly] restrictive, its occurrence in another sense would be at variance with the original import; but to this it may be replied, that if it were [properly] corroborative, its occurrence in another sense would be at variance with the original import: it [therefore] seems that it is susceptible of both these meanings, bearing one or the other according as this or that suits the place. (Msb.) اـِنَّمَا is to be distinguished from اـِنَّ with the conjunct [noun] مَا, which does not restrain it from governing [though its government with this is not apparent, and which is written separately]; as in اـِنَّ مَا عِنْكَ حَسَنٌ meaning &lt;i&gt;Verily what is with thee is good,&lt;/i&gt; and in اـِنَّ مَا فَعَلْتَ حَسَنٌ meaning &lt;i&gt;Verily thy deed is good.&lt;/i&gt; (I&#39; Ak pp. 97 and 98.) ―         -b7-  اـِنَّ is sometimes contracted into اـِنٌ; (S, Mughnee, K;) and in this case, it is made to govern and is made to have no government: (S:) it is seldom made to govern in this case; often made to have no government: the Koofees say that it is not contracted; (Mughnee, K;) and that when one says, اـِنْ زَيْدٌ لَمُنْطَلِقٌ [the meaning is virtually &lt;i&gt;Verily Zeyd is going away,&lt;/i&gt; but] اـِنٌ is a negative and the ل is syn. with اـِلّا; but this assertion is refuted by the fact that some make it to govern when contracted, as in exs. cited above, voce اـِنْ, q. v. (Mughnee.) ―         -b8-  It is also &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  نَعَمٌ [&lt;i&gt;Even so; yes; yea&lt;/i&gt;]; (Mughnee, K;) contr. to the opinion of AO. (Mughnee.) [See also اَنَّ, last sentence.] Those who affirm it to have this meaning cite as an ex. the following verse (Mughnee, K *) of &#39;Obeyd-Allah Ibn-Keys-er-Rukeiyát: (S, * TA:) &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        كَ وَقَدْ كَبِرْتَ فَقُلْتُ اـِنَّهْ <br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        وَيَقُلْنَ شَيْبٌ قَدْ عَلَا<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;And they say,&lt;/i&gt; (namely, the women,) &lt;i&gt;Hoariness hath come upon thee, and thou hast become old:&lt;/i&gt; and I say, &lt;i&gt;Even so,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;yes,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;yea&lt;/i&gt;]: (Mughnee, K:) but this has been rebutted by the saying, We do not concede that the ه is here added to denote the pause, but assert that it is a pronoun, governed by اـِنَّ in the accus. case, and the predicate is suppressed; the meaning being, اـِنَّهُ <br>\
                  كَذٰلِكَ [&lt;i&gt;Verily it,&lt;/i&gt; i. e. &lt;i&gt;the case, is thus&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee.) [J says,] The meaning is, اـنَّهُ قَدْ كَانَ كَمَا <br>\
                  تَقُلْنَ [&lt;i&gt;Verily it,&lt;/i&gt; i. e. &lt;i&gt;the case, hath been as ye say&lt;/i&gt;]: A &#39;Obeyd says, This is a curtailment of the speech of the Arabs; the pronoun being deemed sufficient because the meaning is known: and as to the saying of Akh, that it signifies نَعَمْ, he only means thereby that it may be so rendered, not that it is originally applied to that signification: he says that the ه is here added to denote the pause. (S.) There is, however, a good ex. of اـِنَّ in the sense of نَعَمْ in the saying of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr, to him who said to him, “May God curse a she camel which carried me to thee,” اـِنَّ وَرَاكِبَهَا, i. e. &lt;i&gt;Even so,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;yes,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;yea;&lt;/i&gt; and may God curse &lt;i&gt;her rider:&lt;/i&gt; for the suppression of both the subject and the predicate is not allowable. (Mughnee.) And hence, accord. to Mbr, the saying in the Kur [xx. 66], as thus read, اـِنَّ <br>\
                  هٰذانِ لَسَاحِرَانِ [meaning, if so, &lt;i&gt;Yes, these two are&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  &lt;pb n=&quot;111&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;enchanters&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee.) [But this phrase has given rise to much discussion, related in the Mughnee and other works. The following is a brief abstract of what has been said respecting it by several of the leading authorities.] A booIs-hák says that the people of El-Medeeneh and El-Koofeh read as above, except &#39;Ásim, who is reported to have read, اـِنٌ هٰذَانِ, without tesh-deed, and so is Kh; [so too is Hafs, as is said above, voce اـِنْ;] and that AA read اـِنَّ هٰذيْنِ, the former word with teshdeed, and the latter in the accus. case: that the argument for اـِنَّ هٰذَانِ, with teshdeed and the nom. case, [or rather what is identical in form with the nom. case,] is, that it is of the dial. of Kináneh, in which the dual is formed by the termination ان in the nom. and accus. and gen. cases alike, as also in the dial. of Benu-l-Hárith Ibn-Kaab: but that the old grammarians say that ه is here suppressed; the meaning being, اـِنَّهُ هٰذَانِ: (T:) this last assertion, however, is weak; for what is applied to the purpose of corroboration should not be suppressed, and the instances of its suppression which have been heard are deviations from general usage, except in the case of اَنَّ, with fet-h, contracted into اَنْ: (Mughnee:) Aboo-Is-hák then adds, that some say, اـِنَّ is here syn. with نَعَمْ: this last opinion he holds to be the best; the meaning being, نَعَمْ هٰذَانِ لَهُمَا سَاحِرَانِ [&lt;i&gt;Yes, these two, verily they are two enchanters:&lt;/i&gt; for this is not a case in which the ل (which is the ل of inception) can be regarded as transferred from its proper place, at the commencement of the sentence or proposition, as it is in some instances mentioned in the former half of this paragraph: but it is said in the Mughnee that this explanation is invalidated by the fact that the combining of the corroborative ل and the suppression of the inchoative is like the combining of two things inconsistent, or incompatible; as is also the opinion that the ل is redundant, because the redundant ل prefixed to the enunciative is peculiar to poetry]: next in point of goodness, in the opinion of A booIs-hák, is, that it is of the dial. of Kináneh and Benu-l-Hárith Ibn-Kaab: the reading of AA he does not allow, because it is at variance with the written text: but he approves the reading of &#39;Ásim and Kh. (T.)       -A2-  اـِنَّ also occurs as a verb: it is the third person pl. fem. of the pret. from الاَيْنُ, syn. with التَّعَبُ; or from ا=نَ syn. with قَرُبَ: or the third person sing. masc. of the pret. passive from الاَنيِنُ, in the dial. of those who, for رُدَّ and حُبَّ, say رِدَّ and حِبَّ, likening these verbs to قِيلَ and بِيعَ: or the sing. masc. of the imperative from the same: or the pl. fem. of the imperative from الاَيْنُ; or from ا=نَ syn. with قَرُبَ: or the sing. fem. of the corroborated form of the imperative from وَاَى, syn. with وَعَدَ.

                  الصَّلَاةِ وَقِصَرَ الخُطْبَةِ مَيِنَّةٌ مِنْ فِقْهِ الرَّجُلِ, (S, Mgh, TA, &amp;amp;c.,) is of the measure مَفعِلَةٌ وَقِصَرَ الخُطْبَةِ مَيِنَّةٌ مِنْ فِقْهِ الرَّجُلِ, [originally مَاْنِنَةٌ,] from اـِنَّ, (S, Z in the Fáïk, IAth, Mgh, K,) the corroborative particle; (Z, IAth, Mgh;) like مَعْسَاةٌ from عَسَى; (S, K;) but not regularly derived from اـِنَّ, because a word may not be so derived from a particle; or it may be said that this is so derived after the particle has been made a noun; (Z, IAth;) or neither of these modes of derivation is regular: (MF:) the meaning is, [&lt;i&gt;Verily the longness of the prayer and the shortness of the oration from the pulpit are&lt;/i&gt; (together)] &lt;i&gt;a proper ground for one&#39;s saying, Verily the man is a person of knowledge&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;intelligence:&lt;/i&gt; (Z, * Mgh, K in art. مان:) this is the proper signification: accord. to AO, the meaning is, &lt;i&gt;a thing whereby one learns the knowledge,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;intelligence, of the man:&lt;/i&gt; (Mgh:) or it means &lt;i&gt;a thing suitable to,&lt;/i&gt; (S, Mgh,) &lt;i&gt;and whereby one knows,&lt;/i&gt; (S,) &lt;i&gt;the knowledge,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;intelligence, of the man:&lt;/i&gt; (S, Mgh:) or &lt;i&gt;a sign&lt;/i&gt; (As, S, K) &lt;i&gt;of the knowledge,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;intelligence, of the man;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;suitable thereto:&lt;/i&gt; (As, S:) or &lt;i&gt;an evidence thereof:&lt;/i&gt; (M:) or &lt;i&gt;an indication,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;a symptom, thereof;&lt;/i&gt; everything that indicates a thing being said to be مَيِنَّةٌ لَهُ: [so that مَيِنَّةٌ لِكَذَا may be well rendered &lt;i&gt;a thing that occasions one&#39;s knowing,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;inferring,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;suspecting, such a thing;&lt;/i&gt; and in like manner, &lt;i&gt;a person that occasions one&#39;s doing so:&lt;/i&gt; or, more properly, &lt;i&gt;a thing, &amp;amp;c., in which such a thing is usually known to take place,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;have place,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;be,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;exist,&lt;/i&gt; like مَظِنَّةٌ:] one of the strangest of the things said of it is, that the ء is a substitute for the ظ of مَظِنَّةٌ: (IAth:) this seems to have been the opinion of Lh: (Az, L:) accord. to AA, it is &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  ا=يَةٌ [&lt;i&gt;a sign,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.]. (TA.) As says (S, * K, TA, all in art. مان) that the word is thus, with teshdeed to the ن, in the trad. and in a verse of poetry, as these are related; (S, TA;) but correctly, in his opinion, it should be مَيِينَةٌ of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ, (S, K, * TA,) unless it be from اـِنَّ, as first stated above: (S, TA:) AZ used to say that it is مَيِتَّةٌ, with ت, (S, K, * TA,) meaning &lt;i&gt;a thing&lt;/i&gt; (lit. &lt;i&gt;a place&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;meet, fit,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;proper,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;worthy&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;deserving,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;the like;&lt;/i&gt; of the measure مَفْعِلَةٌ, [originally مَاْتِتَةٌ,] from اَتَّهُ meaning “he overcame him with an argument or the like:” (S, K, TA:) but some say that it is of the measure فَعِلَّةٌ, from مَاَنَ meaning اِحْتَمَلَ: see art. مان. (K in that art.) You say also, هُوَ مَيِنَّةٌ لِلْخَيْرِ, from اـِنَّ, &lt;i&gt;He is a person fit,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;proper, for one&#39;s saying of him, Verily he is good;&lt;/i&gt; and in like manner, مَعْسَاةٌ, from عَسَى, as meaning “a person fit, or proper, for one&#39;s saying of him, May-be he will do good.” (A, TA.) And اـِنَّهُ لَمَيِنَّةٌ اَنْ يَكُونَ كَذَا <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;Verily it is meet, fit,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;proper, for one&#39;s saying of it, Verily it is thus;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;is worthy,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;deserving, of one&#39;s saying&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.: or &lt;i&gt;verily it is a thing meet, fit,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;proper, for one&#39;s saying&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.; or &lt;i&gt;is a thing worthy,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;deserving, of one&#39;s saying&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.: of the measure مَفْعِلَةٌ, from اـِنَّ. (K in the present art.) And اـِنَّهُ لَمَيِنَّةٌ اَنْ يَفْعَلَ ذَاكَ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;Verily he is meet, fit,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;proper, for doing that;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;is worthy,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;deserving, of doing that:&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;verily he is a person meet, fit,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;proper, for doing that;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;is a person worthy,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;deserving, of doing that:&lt;/i&gt; and in like manner you say of two, and of more, and of a female: but مَيِنَّةٌ may be of the measure فَعِلَّةٌ [from مان], i. e. a triliteral-radical word. (M.) ―         -b2-  You also say, اَتَاهُ عَلَي مَينَّة ذَاكَ, meaning &lt;i&gt;He came to him at the time,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;season,&lt;/i&gt; [or &lt;i&gt;fit&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;proper time,&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;of that;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;at the first thereof.&lt;/i&gt; (M.)   &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\
