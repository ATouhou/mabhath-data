(TA.) The ال is pronounced with the disjunctive hemzeh in using the vocative form of address [يَا اَللّٰهُ] because it is inseparably prefixed as an honourable distinction of this name; (S;) or because a pause upon the vocative particle is intended in honour of the name; (S in art. ليه;) and AAF says that it is also thus pronounced in a form of swearing; as in اَفَاَللّٰهِ لَتَفْعَلَنَّ [an elliptical phrase, as will be shown below, meaning &lt;i&gt;Then, by God, wilt thou indeed do&lt;/i&gt; such a thing?]; though he denies its being thus pronounced because it is inseparable; regarding it as a substitute for the suppressed hemzeh of الاـِلَاهُ: (S in the present art.:) Sb mentions this pronunciation in يَا اَللّٰهُ; and Th mentions the pronunciation of يَا اللّٰهُ also, with the conjunctive hemzeh: Ks, moreover, mentions, as used by the Arabs, the phrase يَلَهْ اَغْفِرْلِى [&lt;i&gt;O God, forgive me&lt;/i&gt;], for يَا اللّٰهُ; but this is disapproved. (ISd, TA.) The word is pronounced in the manner termed تَفْخِيم, [i. e., with the broad sound of the lengthened fet-h, and with a full sound of the letter ل,] for the purpose of showing honour to it; but when it is preceded by a kesreh, [as in بِاللّٰهِ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;By God,&lt;/i&gt; and بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;In the name of God,&lt;/i&gt;] it is pronounced in the [contr.] manner termed تَرْقِيق: AHát says that some of the vulgar say, لَاوَاللّٰهْ [&lt;i&gt;No, by God&lt;/i&gt;], suppressing the alif, which should necessarily be uttered, as in الرَّحْمنُ, which is in like manner written without alif; and he adds that some person has composed a verse in which the alif [in this word] is suppressed, erroneously. (Msb.) You say, اَللّٰهَ اللّٰهَ فِى كَذَا, [a verb being understood,] meaning &lt;i&gt;Fear ye God, fear ye God, with respect to such a thing.&lt;/i&gt; (Marginal note in a copy of the Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer. [See another ex. voce كَرَّةٌ.]) And اَللّٰهَ لَاَفْعَلَنَّ and اَللّٰهِ لَاَفْعَلَنَّ [&lt;i&gt;By God, I will assuredly do&lt;/i&gt; such a thing]: in the former is understood a verb significant of swearing; and in the latter, [or in both, for a noun is often put in the accus. case because of a particle understood,] a particle [such as بِ or وَ] denoting an oath. (Bd in ii. 1.) And لِلهِ مَا فَعَلْتُ, meaning وَاللّٰهِ مَا فَعَلْتُ [&lt;i&gt;By God, I did not,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;have not done,&lt;/i&gt; such a thing]. (JK.) And لِلّهِ دَرُّكَ (tropical:)  &lt;i&gt;To God be attributed thy deed!&lt;/i&gt; (A in art. در:) or &lt;i&gt;the good that hath proceeded from thee!&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;thy good deed!&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;thy gift!&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;what is received from thee!&lt;/i&gt; [and &lt;i&gt;thy flow of eloquence!&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;the like&lt;/i&gt;]: a phrase expressive of admiration of anything: (TA in art. در:) [when said to an eloquent speaker or poet, it may be rendered &lt;i&gt;divinely art thou gifted!&lt;/i&gt;]. And لِلّهِ دَرُّهُ (tropical:)  &lt;i&gt;To God be attributed his deed!&lt;/i&gt; [&amp;amp;c.]. (S and K in art. در.) And لِلّهِ القَايِلُ [meaning &lt;i&gt;To God be attributed&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;the eloquence of&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;the sayer!&lt;/i&gt; or] &lt;i&gt;how good,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;beautiful, is the saying of the sayer,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;of him who says&lt;/i&gt; [such and such words]! or it is like the phrase لِلّهِ دَرُّهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  &lt;i&gt;To God be attributed his goodness!&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;his pure action!&lt;/i&gt; (Har p. 11.) And لِلّهِ فُلَانٌ [&lt;i&gt;To God be attributed&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;the excel-lence,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;goodness,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;deed,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c., &lt;i&gt;of&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;such a one!&lt;/i&gt;] explained by Az as meaning &lt;i&gt;wonder ye at such a one: how perfect is he!&lt;/i&gt; (Har ibid.) [And لِلّهِ اَبُوكَ: see art. ابو.] And لَاهِ اَنْتَ, meaning لِلّهِ اَنْتَ [lit. &lt;i&gt;To God be thou attributed!&lt;/i&gt; i. e. &lt;i&gt;to God be attributed thine excellence!&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;thy goodness!&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;thy deed!&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.]. (JK.) [Similar to لِلّهِ, thus used, is the Hebrew expression        <br>\
      &lt;orth lang=&quot;he&quot;&gt;לֵאלֹהּים&lt;/orth&gt; after an epithet signifying “great” or the like.] اـِنَّالِلّهِ وَاـِنَّا اـِلَيْهِ <br>\
                  رَاجِعُونَ, in the Kur [ii. 151], said on the occasion of an affliction, means &lt;i&gt;Verily to God we belong,&lt;/i&gt; as property and servants, He doing with us what He willeth, &lt;i&gt;and verily unto Him we return&lt;/i&gt; in the ultimate state of existence, and He will recompense us. (Jel.) AZ mentions the phrase الحَمْدُلَاهِ [meaning الحَمْدُلِلّهِ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;Praise be to God&lt;/i&gt;]: but this is not allowable in the Kur-án: it is only related as heard from the Arabs of the desert, and those not knowing the usage of the Kur-án. (Az, TA.) ―         -b2-  ↓ <br>\
      اَللّهُمَّ is an expression used in prayer; as also لَاهُمَّ; (JK, Msb;) meaning يَا اَللّٰهُ [&lt;i&gt;O God&lt;/i&gt;]; the م being a substitute for [the suppressed vocative particle] يا; (S in art. ليه, and Bd in iii. 25;) but one says also, يَا اَللّهُمَّ, (JK, and S ibid,) by poetic licence: (S ibid:) or the meaning, accord. to some, is يَا اَللّٰهُ اُمَّنَا بِخَيْرٍ [&lt;i&gt;O God, bring us good&lt;/i&gt;]; (JK, and Bd ubi suprà;) and hence the origin of the expression. (Bd.) You say also اَللّهُمَّ اـِلَّا [which may be rendered, inversely, &lt;i&gt;Unless, indeed;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;unless, possibly&lt;/i&gt;]: the former word being thus used to denote that the exception is something very rare. (Mtr in the commencement of his Expos. of the Makámát of El-Hareeree, and Har pp. 52 and 53.) And اَللّهُمَّ نَعَمْ [which may be rendered, inversely, &lt;i&gt;Yes, indeed;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;yea, verily&lt;/i&gt;]: the former word being used in this case as corroborative of the answer to an interrogation, negative and affirmative. (Har p. 563.)    &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\
