You say, اَلَا فِى الاَمْرِ, (Mgh,) and ↓ <br>\

                  فِيهِ, (S,) &lt;i&gt;He fell short,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c., (قَصَّرَ,) &lt;i&gt;in the affair.&lt;/i&gt; (S, Mgh.) In the saying, لَم يَاْلُ اَنْ يَعْدِلَ فِى ذلِكَ, i. e. &lt;i&gt;He did not fall short,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c., (لَمْ يُقَصَّرْ,) &lt;i&gt;in acting equitably and equally in that,&lt;/i&gt; <br>\

                  مِنَ العَدْلِ, as some relate it, [the meaning intended seems to be, &lt;i&gt;They did not hold back,&lt;/i&gt; or the like, &lt;i&gt;from acting equitably;&lt;/i&gt; for here] the verb is made to imply the meaning of another verb: and such is the case in the saying, لَا ا=لُوكَ نُصْحًا, meaning &lt;i&gt;I will not refuse to thee, nor partially&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;wholly deprive thee of, sincere, honest,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;faithful, advice:&lt;/i&gt; (Mgh:) or this last signifies &lt;i&gt;I will not flag,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;be remiss, nor fall short, to thee in giving sincere, honest,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;faithful,&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;advice.&lt;/i&gt; (T, S. *) It is said in the Kur [iii. 114], لَا يَاـْلُونَكُمْ خَبَالًا, meaning &lt;i&gt;They will not fall short,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;flag,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;be remiss, in corrupting you.&lt;/i&gt; (IAar, T.)

      وَلَا يَاْتَلِ, in the Kur [xxiv. 22], by A&#39;Obeyd: but the preferable rendering in this case is that of A Heyth, which will be found below: see 4. (T.) Ks mentions the phrase, اَقْبَلَ بِضَرْبَةٍ لَا يَاْلُ [&lt;i&gt;He came with a blow, not falling short,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.], for لا يَاْلُو; like لَا اَدْرِ [for لا اَدْرِى]. (S, M: [but in the copies of the former in my hands, for بِضَرْبَةٍ, I find يَضْرِبُهُ.]) ↓ <br>\
      اَلَّى [with teshdeed] is also said of a dog, and of a hawk, meaning &lt;i&gt;He fell short of attaining the game that he pursued.&lt;/i&gt; (TA.) And of a cake of bread, meaning &lt;i&gt;It was slow in becoming thoroughly baked.&lt;/i&gt; (IAar, IB.)

And فُلَانٌ لَا يَاْلُو خَيْرًا <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;Such a one does not leave, quit,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;cease from, doing good.&lt;/i&gt; (M.) And مَا اَلَوْتُ جَهْدًا <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;I did not leave, omit,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;neglect, labour, exertion, effort,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;endeavour:&lt;/i&gt; and the vulgar say, مَا ا=لُوكَ جَهْدًا; but this is wrong: so says As. (T. [See, however, similar phrases mentioned above.])       -A2-  اَلَا, aor. as above, (TA,) inf. n. اَلْوٌ, (IAar, T, TA,) also signifies &lt;i&gt;He strove,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;laboured; he exerted himself,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;his power&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;ability;&lt;/i&gt; (IAar, T, TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
      تَاَلَّى: (T, TA:) the contr. of a signification before mentioned; i. e. “he flagged;,” or “was remiss, or languid, and weak.” (TA.) You say, اَتَانِى فِى حَاجَةٍ فَاَلَوْتُ فِيهَا <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;He came to me respecting a want, and I strove,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;laboured,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c., &lt;i&gt;to accomplish it.&lt;/i&gt; (T.) ―         -b2-  And اَلَاهُ, aor. as above, (T, S,) inf. n. اَلْوٌ, (IAar, T, S,) &lt;i&gt;He was,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;became, able to do it:&lt;/i&gt; (IAar, T, S:) and ↓ <br>\

                  &lt;i&gt;Such a one came to me respecting a want, and I was not able to rebuff him.&lt;/i&gt; (T.) It is said in a trad., مَنْ صَامَ ↓ <br>\

(TA.) And the Arabs used to say, (S, M,) [and] accord. to a trad. it will be said to the hypocrite [in his grave], on his being asked respecting Mohammad and what he brought, and answering “I know not,” (T in art. تلو,) ↓ <br>\
      لَا دَرَيْتَ وَلَا ايتَلَيْتَ, (T, S, M, K,) meaning, accord. to As, (T,) or ISk, (S,) &lt;i&gt;Mayest thou not know, nor be able&lt;/i&gt; to know: (T, S: *) or, accord. to Fr, &lt;i&gt;nor fall short,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;flag,&lt;/i&gt; in seeking to know; that the case may be the more miserable to thee: (T:) or وَلَا اَلَيْتَ, as an imitative sequent [for ولا اَلَوْتَ, to which the same explanations are applicable]: (MK:) or لَا دَرَيْتَ وَلَا تَلَيْتَ, the latter verb being assimilated to the former, (ISk, T in art. تلو, S,) said to mean وَلَا تَلَوْتَ, i. e. &lt;i&gt;nor mayest thou read nor study:&lt;/i&gt; (T in art.    &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\

It is a prep., or particle governing a noun in the gen. case, (S, Mughnee, K,) and denotes the end, as opposed to [مِنْ, which denotes] the beginning, of an extent, or of the space between two points or limits; (S, M;) or the end of an extent (T, Mughnee, K) of place; [signifying &lt;i&gt;To,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;as far as;&lt;/i&gt;] as in the phrase [in the Kur xvii. 1], مِنَ المَسْجِدِ الحَرَامِ اـِلَى المَسْجِدِ الاَقْصَى [&lt;i&gt;From the Sacred Mosque to,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;as far as, the Furthest Mosque;&lt;/i&gt; meaning from the mosque of Mekkeh to that of Jerusalem]; (Mughnee, K;) or in the saying, خَرَجْتُ مِنَ الكُوفَةِ اـِلَى مَكَّةَ [&lt;i&gt;I went forth from El-Koofeh to Mekkeh&lt;/i&gt;], which may mean that you entered it, [namely, the latter place,] or that you reached it without entering it, for the end includes the beginning of the limit and the furthest part thereof, but does not extend beyond it. (S.) [In some respects it agrees with حَتَّى, q. v. And sometimes it signifies &lt;i&gt;Towards;&lt;/i&gt; as in نَظَرَ اـِلَىَّ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;He looked towards me;&lt;/i&gt; and مَالَ اـِلَيْهِ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;He,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;it, inclined towards him,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;it.&lt;/i&gt; ―         -b2-  It also denotes the end of a space of time; [signifying &lt;i&gt;To, till,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;until;&lt;/i&gt;] as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 183], ثُمَّ اَتِمُّوا الصِّيَامَ اـِلَى اللَّيْلِ [&lt;i&gt;Then complets ye the fasting to,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;till,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;until, the night&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee, K.) [Hence, اـِلَى اَنْ (followed by a mansoob aor.) &lt;i&gt;Till,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;until:&lt;/i&gt; and اـِلَى مَتَى <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;Till,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;until, what time,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;when?&lt;/i&gt; i. e. &lt;i&gt;how long?&lt;/i&gt; and also &lt;i&gt;to, till,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;until, the time when.&lt;/i&gt; See also the last sentence in this paragraph.] ―         -b3-  [In like manner it is used in the phrases اـِلَى غَيْرِ ذلِكَ, and اـِلَى ا=خِرِهِ, meaning, (&lt;i&gt;And so on,&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;to other things,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;to the end thereof;&lt;/i&gt; equivalent to &lt;i&gt;et cœtera.&lt;/i&gt;] ―         -b4-  Sometimes, (S,) it occurs in the sense of مَعَ, (T, S, M, Mughnee, K,) when a thing is joined to another thing; (Mughnee, K;) as in the phrase [in the Kur iii. 45 and lxi. 14], مَنْ اَنْصَارِى اـِلَى اللّٰهِ [&lt;i&gt;Who will be my aiders with,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;in addition to, God?&lt;/i&gt;], (S, Mughnee, K,) accord. to the Koofees and some of the Basrees; (Mughnee;) i. e. &lt;i&gt;who will be joined to God in aiding me?&lt;/i&gt; (M, TA;) and as in the saying [in the Kur iv. 2], وَلَا تَاْكُلُوا <br>\
                  اَمْوَالَهُمْ اـِلَى اَمْوَالِكُمْ [&lt;i&gt;And devour not ye their possessions with,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;in addition to, your possessions&lt;/i&gt;]; (T, S;) and [in the same, ii. 13,] وَاـِذَا خَلَوْا اـِلَى <br>\
                  شَيَا طِينِهِمْ [&lt;i&gt;And when they are alone with their devils&lt;/i&gt;]; (S;) and in the saying, الذَّوْدُ اـِلَى الذَّوْدِ اـِبِلٌ [&lt;i&gt;A few she-camels with,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;added to, a few she-camels are a herd of camels&lt;/i&gt;], (S, Mughnee, K,) a prov., meaning (assumed tropical:)  &lt;i&gt;a little with a little makes much;&lt;/i&gt; (S and A in art. ذود, q. v.;) though one may not say, اـِلَى زَيْدٍ مَالٌ meaning مَعَ زَيْدٍ مَالٌ: (Mughnee:) so too in the saying, فُلَانٌ حَلِيمٌ اـِلَى اَدَبٍ وَفِقْهٍ [&lt;i&gt;Such a one is clement,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;forbearing, with good education,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;polite accomplishments, and intelligence,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;knowledge of the law&lt;/i&gt;]; (M, TA;) and so, accord. to Kh, in the phrase, اَحْمَدُ اللّٰهَ اـِلَيْكَ [&lt;i&gt;I praise God with thee:&lt;/i&gt; but see another rendering of this phrase below]. (ISh.) In the saying in the Kur [v. 8], فَاغْسِلُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ وَاَيْدِيَكُمْ <br>\
                  اـِلَى المَرَافِقِ, it is disputed whether [the meaning be &lt;i&gt;Then wash ye your faces, and your arms with the elbows,&lt;/i&gt; or, &lt;i&gt;and your arms as far as the elbows;&lt;/i&gt; i. e., whether] the elbows be meant to be included among the parts to be washed, or excluded therefrom. (T.) A context sometimes shows that what follows it is included in what precedes it; as in قَرَاْتُ القُرْا=نَ مِنْ اَوَّلِهِ اـِلَى ا=خِرِهِ [&lt;i&gt;I read,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;recited, the Kurán, from the beginning thereof to the end thereof&lt;/i&gt;]: or that it is excluded; as in ثُمَّ اَتِمُّوا الصِّيَامَ اـِلَى اللَّيْلِ [explained above]: when this is not the case, some say that it is included if it be of the same kind [as that which precedes]; some, that it is included absolutely; and some, that it is excluded absolutely; and this is the right assertion; for with the context it is in most instances excluded. (Mughnee.) ―         -b5-  It is also used to show the grammatical agency of the noun governed by it, after a verb of wonder; or after a noun of excess importing love or hatred; [as in مَا اَحَبَّهُ اـِلَىَّ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;How lovely,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;pleasing, is he to me!&lt;/i&gt; (TA in art. حب,) and مَا اَبْغَضَهُ اـِلَىَّ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;How hateful,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;odious, is he to me!&lt;/i&gt; (S in art. بغض;) and] as in the saying [in the Kur xii. 33], رَبِّ <br>\
                  السِّجْنُ اَحَبُّ اـِلَىَّ [&lt;i&gt;O my Lord, the prison is more pleasing to me&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee, K.) [This usage is similar to that explained in the next sentence.] ―         -b6-  It is &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  عِنْدَ; (S, M, Mughnee, Msb, K;) as in the phrase, هُوَ اَشْهَى اـِلَىَّ مِنْ كَذَا [&lt;i&gt;It is more desirable,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;pleasant, in my estimation than such a thing&lt;/i&gt;]; (Msb;) and in the saying of the poet, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اَمْ لَا سَبِيلَ اـِلَى الشَّبَابِ وَذِكْرُهُ<br>\

                        اَشْهَى اـِلَىَّ مِنَ الرَّحِيقِ السَّلْسَلِ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Is there no way &lt;/i&gt; of return &lt;i&gt;to youth, seeing that the remembrance thereof is more pleasant to me,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;in my estimation, than mellow wine?&lt;/i&gt;] (Mughnee, K:) and accord. to this usage of اـِلَى in the sense of عِنْدَ may be explained the saying, اَنْتِ <br>\
                  طَالِقٌ اـِلَى سَنَةٍ, meaning &lt;i&gt;Thou art divorced at&lt;/i&gt; the commencement of &lt;i&gt;a year.&lt;/i&gt; (Msb.) ―         -b7-  It is also &lt;i&gt;syn.&lt;/i&gt; with لِ; as in the phrase, وَالاَمْرُ اـِلَيْكَ [&lt;i&gt;And command,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;to command, belongeth unto Thee,&lt;/i&gt; meaning God, as in the Kur xiii. 30, and xxx. 3], (Mughnee, K,) in a trad. respecting supplication: (TA:) or, as some say, it is here used in the manner first explained above, meaning, &lt;i&gt;is ultimately referrible to Thee:&lt;/i&gt; and they say, اَحْمَدُ <br>\
                  اللّٰهَ اـِلَيْكَ, meaning, &lt;i&gt;I tell the praise of God unto thee:&lt;/i&gt; (Mughnee:) [but see another rendering of this last phrase above:] you say also, ذَاكَ اـِلَيْكَ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;That is committed to thee,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;to thy arbitration.&lt;/i&gt; (Har p. 329.) ―         -b8-  It also occurs as &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  عَلَى; as in the saying in the Kur [xvii. 4], وَقَضَيْنَا اـِلَى <br>\
                  بَنِى اـِسْرَايِيلَ [&lt;i&gt;And we decreed against the children of Israel&lt;/i&gt;]: (Msb:) or this means &lt;i&gt;and we revealed to the children of Israel&lt;/i&gt; (Bd, Jel) &lt;i&gt;decisively.&lt;/i&gt; (Bd.) ―         -b9-  It is also syn. with فِى; (M, Mughnee, K;) as in the saying [in the Kur iv. 89 and vi.12], لَيَجْمَعَنَّكُمْ اـِلَى يَوْمِ القِيَامَةِ [&lt;i&gt;He will assuredly collect you together on the day of resurrection&lt;/i&gt;]: (K:) thus it may be used in this instance accord. to Ibn-Málik: (Mughnee:) and it is said to be so used in the saying [of En-Nábighah, (M, TA,)] &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\

                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اـِلَي النَّاسِ مَطْلِىٌّ بِهِ القَارُ اَجْرَبُ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Then do not thou leave me with threatening, as though I were, among men, smeared with tar,&lt;/i&gt; being like a &lt;i&gt;mangy&lt;/i&gt; camel]; (M, Mughnee;) or, accord. to some, there is an ellipsis and inversion in this verse; الى being here in dependence upon a word suppressed, and the meaning being, &lt;i&gt;smeared with pitch,&lt;/i&gt; [like a camel,] &lt;i&gt;yet being united to men:&lt;/i&gt; or, accord. to Ibn-&#39;Osfoor, مطلىّ is here considered as made to import the meaning of &lt;i&gt;rendered hateful,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;odious;&lt;/i&gt; for he says that if الى were correctly used in the sense of فى, it it would be allowable to say, زَيْدٌاـِلَى الكُوفَةِ: (Mughnee:) [or the meaning may be, &lt;i&gt;as though I were, compared to men, a mangy&lt;/i&gt; camel, &lt;i&gt;smeared with pitch:&lt;/i&gt; for] I&#39;Ab said, after mentioning &#39;Alee, عِلْمِى اـِلَى عِلْمِهِ كَالقَرَارَةِ فِى المُثُعَنْجَرِ, meaning &lt;i&gt;My knowledge compared to his knowledge is like the&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  قرارة [or &lt;i&gt;small pool of water left by a torrent&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;placed by the side of the middle of the sea&lt;/i&gt; [or &lt;i&gt;the main deep&lt;/i&gt;]. (K in art. ثعجر.) It is also [said to be] used in the sense of فى in the saying in the Kur [1xxix. 18], هَلْ لَكَ اـِلَى اَنْ تَزَكَّى [&lt;i&gt;Wilt thou purify thyself&lt;/i&gt; from infidelity?] because it imports the meaning of invitation. (TA.) ―         -b10-  It is also used [in a manner contr. to its primitive application, i. e.,] to denote beginning, [or origination,] being &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  مِنْ; as in the saying [of a poet], &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        تَقُولُ وَقَدْ عَالَيْتُ بِالكُورِ فَوْقَهَا<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اَيُسْقَي فَلَا يَرْوَى اـِلَىَّ ابْنُ اَحْمَرَا<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;She says,&lt;/i&gt; (namely my camel,) &lt;i&gt;when I have raised the saddle upon her, Will Ibn-Ahmar be supplied with drink and not satisfy his thirst from me?&lt;/i&gt; i. e., will he never be satisfied with drawing forth my sweat?]. (Mughnee, K.) ―         -b11-  It is also used as a corroborative, and is thus [syntactically] redundant; as in the saying in the Kur [xiv. 40], فَاجْعَلْ اَفْيِدَةً مِنَ النَّاسِ تَهْوَى اـِلَيْهِمْ, with fet-h to the و [in تهوى], (Mughnee, K,) accord. &lt;pb n=&quot;86&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; to one reading, (Mughnee,) meaning تَهْوَاهُمْ [i. e. &lt;i&gt;And make Thou hearts of men to love them&lt;/i&gt;]: (K:) so says Fr: but some explain it by saying that تهوى imports the meaning of تَمِيلُ; or that it is originally تَهْوِى, with kesr, the kesreh being changed to a fet-hah, and the yé to an alif, as when one says رَضَا for رَضِىَ, and نَاصَاةٌ for نَاصِيَةٌ: so says Ibn-Málik; but this requires consideration; for it is a condition in such cases that the ى in the original form must be movent. (Mughnee.) [See art. هوى.] ―         -b12-  اَللّٰهُمَّ اـِلَيْكَ, occurring in a trad., [is elliptical, and] means &lt;i&gt;O God, I complain unto Thee:&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;take Thou me unto Thee.&lt;/i&gt; (TA.) ―         -b13-  And اَنَا مِنْكَ وَاـِلَيْكَ means &lt;i&gt;I am of thee, and related to thee.&lt;/i&gt; (TA.) ―         -b14-  You say also, اِذْهَبْ اـِلَيْكَ, meaning &lt;i&gt;Betake,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;apply, thyself to,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;occupy thyself with, thine own affairs.&lt;/i&gt; (T, K. *) And similar to this is the phrase used by El-Aashà, فَاذْهَبِى مَا اـِلَيْكِ. (TA.) And اـِلَيْكُمْ [alone is used in a similar manner, elliptically, or as an imperative verbal noun, and] means &lt;i&gt;Betake,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;apply, yourselves to,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;occupy yourselves with, your own affairs,&lt;/i&gt; (اِذْهَبُوا اـِلَيْكُمْ,) &lt;i&gt;and retire ye,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;withdraw ye, to a distance,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;far away, from us.&lt;/i&gt; (ISk.) And اـِلَيْكَ عَنِّى means &lt;i&gt;Hold,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;refrain, thou from me:&lt;/i&gt; (T, K:) or &lt;i&gt;remove, withdraw,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;retire, thou to a distance from me:&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  اليك used in this sense is an imperative verbal noun. (Har p. 508.) Sb says, (M,) or Akh, (Har ubi suprà,) I heard an Arab of the desert, on its being said to him اـِلَيْكَ, reply, اـِلَىَّ; as though it were said to him &lt;i&gt;Remove, withdraw,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;retire, thou to a distance,&lt;/i&gt; and he replied, &lt;i&gt;I will remove,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c. (M.) Aboo-Fir&#39; own says, satirizing a Nabathæan woman of whom he asked for water to drink, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اـِذَا طَلَبْتَ المَا=ءِ قَالَتْ لَيْكَا<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;When thou shalt demand water, she will say, Retire thou to a distance&lt;/i&gt;]; meaning, [by ليكا, i. e. لَيْكَ with an adjunct alif for the sake of the rhyme,] اـِلَيْكَ, in the sense last explained above. (M.) ―         -b15-  One also says, اـِلَيْكَ كَذَا, meaning, &lt;i&gt;Take thou such a thing.&lt;/i&gt; (T, K.) ―         -b16-  When اـِلَى is immediately followed by the interrogative مَا, both together are written اـِلَامَ [meaning, &lt;i&gt;To what? whither?&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;till,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;until, what time,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;when?&lt;/i&gt; i. e. &lt;i&gt;how long?&lt;/i&gt;]; and in like manner one writes عَلَامَ for عَلَى مَا, (S * and K voce ما,) and حَتَّامَ for حَتَّى.
