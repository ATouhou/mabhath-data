                     ذ<br>\
                  &lt;/form&gt; is originally اَبَوٌ, (S, Msb, K,) as is shown by the first of its dual forms and of its pl. forms mentioned below; (S, Msb;) and signifies &lt;i&gt;A father&lt;/i&gt; [in the ordinary sense: and also as meaning (assumed tropical:)  &lt;i&gt;an ancestor&lt;/i&gt;]: (M:) as also ↓ <br>\
      اَبًا, a dial. var., (M, K,) the same in the nom. and accus. and gen. cases, like قَفًا: (M:) and اَبٌّ is a dial. var. of the same, [the second letter being doubled to compensate for the و suppressed, as is the case in اَخٌّ, (TA voce اَخٌ)] but is rare. (Msb.) Accord. to the dial. commonly obtaining, when you use it as a prefixed noun, you decline it with the letters و and ا and ى, saying, هٰذَااَبُوهُ [&lt;i&gt;This is his father&lt;/i&gt;], (Msb,) and اَبُوكَ [&lt;i&gt;thy father&lt;/i&gt;]; (M;) and رَاَيْتُ اَبَاهُ [&lt;i&gt;I saw his father&lt;/i&gt;]; and مَرَرْتُ بِاَبِيهِ [&lt;i&gt;I passed by his father&lt;/i&gt;]: (Msb:) but accord. to one dial., you say, هٰذَا اَبَاهُ, (Msb:) and اَبَاكَ; (M;) and رَاَيْتُ اَبَاهُ; and مَرَرْتُ بِاَبَاهُ: (Msb:) and accord. to one dial., which is the rarest of all, it is defective in every case, like يَدٌ and دَمٌ; (Msb;) and [thus] you say, هٰذَا اَبُوكَ [&amp;amp;c.]. (M.) The dual is اَبَوَانِ, (S, M, Msb,) meaning [&lt;i&gt;two fathers,&lt;/i&gt; and] &lt;i&gt;father and mother;&lt;/i&gt; and some say اَبَانِ: (S, M:) you say, هُمَااَبَوَاهُ, meaning &lt;i&gt;They two are his father and mother;&lt;/i&gt; and in poetry you may say, هُمَا اَبَاهُ; and in like manner, رَاَيْتُ اَبَيْهِ [&lt;i&gt;I saw his father and mother&lt;/i&gt;], (T,) and اَبَيْكَ [&lt;i&gt;thy father and mother&lt;/i&gt;]; (S;) but the usual, or chaste, form is رَاَيْتُ اَبَوَيْهِ. (T.) The pl. is ا=بَا=ءٌ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) the best form, (T,) and اَبُونَ, (T, S, M, K,) and اُبُوٌّ (M, K, [in the CK الاَبْوٌ is erroneously put for الاُبُوٌّ,]) and اُبُوَّةٌ, (Lh, T, S, M, K, *) like عُمُومَةٌ and خُوُولَةٌ: (T, S:) you say, هٰوُلَا=ءِ اَبُوكُمْ, meaning ا=بَاوُكُمْ [&lt;i&gt;These are your fathers&lt;/i&gt;]; (T;) and hence, in the Kur [ii. 127], accord. to one reading, وَاـِلٰهَ اَبِيكَ اـِبرٰهِيمَ وَاـِسْمٰعِيلَ وَاـِسْحٰقَ [&lt;i&gt;And the God of thy fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac&lt;/i&gt;], meaning the pl. of ابٌ, i. e. اَبِينَكَ, of which the ن is suppressed because the noun is prefixed [to the pronoun]; (S;) and some of the Arabs say, اَبُوَّتُنَا اَكْرَمُ الا=بَا=ءِ [&lt;i&gt;Our fathers are the most generous of fathers&lt;/i&gt;]. (T.) The dim. is ↓ <br>\
      اُبَّىٌّ; originally اُبَيْوٌ, with the final radical letter restored. (Msb.) ―         -b2-  مَا يَدْرِى لَهُ مِنْ اَبٍ, and مَا اَبٌ, mean- &lt;i&gt;ing He knows not who is his father,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;what is his father,&lt;/i&gt; are sayings mentioned by Lh on the authority of Ks. (M.) ―         -b3-  لَا اَبَا لِكَ, (T, S, M, K, &amp;amp;c.,) [accord. to the dial. of him who says اَبًا instead of اَبٌ,] as also لَا اَبَ لَكَ, and لَا اَبَاكَ, (S, K,) [the last, accord. to J, because the ل (meaning the ل in لك in the preceding phrases) is as though it were redundant, but he seems not to have known the dial. var. اَبًا, and I rather think that لَا اَبَاكَ, is for لَا اَبْقَى اْللّٰهُ اَبَاكَ, or the like,] and لَا اَبَكَ, (Mbr, Sgh, K,) and لَابَ لَكَ, (K,) which is for لَا اَبَ لَكَ, (M,) means Thou art, in my estimation, one deserving of its being said to him, &lt;i&gt;Mayest thou have no father!&lt;/i&gt; it is used in the manner of a proverb, is of frequent occurrence in poetry, (M,) is said to him who has a father and to him who has not a father, and is an imprecation as to the meaning, of necessity, though enunciative as to the letter; (M, K;) and hence the saying of Jereer, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        يَا تَيْمُ تَيْمَ عَدِىٍّ لَا اَبَا لَكُمْ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;O Teym, Teym of &#39;Ades, may ye have no&lt;/i&gt; <br>\

                  &lt;i&gt;father!&lt;/i&gt;]; which is the strongest evidence of its being a proverb, and not having a literal meaning; for all of [the tribe of] Teym could not have one father, but all of them were fit objects of imprecation and rough speech: (M:) it is an expression of praise: (S:) [i. e.] it is an imprecation against him to whom it is addressed, not, however, said with the desire of its having effect, but on an occasion of intense love, like لَا اُمَّ لَكَ, &amp;amp;c.: (Har p. 165:) and sometimes in dispraise, like لَا اُمَّ لَكَ: and in wonder, like لِلّهِ دَرُّكَ: (TA:) or, as A Heyth says, on the authority of Aboo-Sa&#39;eed Ed- Dareer, it expresses the utmost degree of reviling; [meaning &lt;i&gt;Thou hast no&lt;/i&gt; known &lt;i&gt;father;&lt;/i&gt;] and لَا اُمَّ لَكَ expresses reviling also, but means Thou hast no free, or ingenuous, mother: (Meyd in Har p. 165: [see اُمَّ:]) sometimes it means &lt;i&gt;Strive,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;exert thyself, in thine affair;&lt;/i&gt; for he who has a father relies upon him in some circumstances of his case: (TA:) accord. to Kh, it means &lt;i&gt;Thou hast none to stand thee in stead of thyself:&lt;/i&gt; (ISh, TA:) Fr says that it is a phrase used by the Arabs [parenthetically, i.e.,] to divide their speech: (TA:) [thus, for instance,] Zufar Ibn-El-Hárith says, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اَرِينِى سِلَاحِى لَا اَبَا لَكَ اـِنَّنِى<br>\

                        اَرَى الحَرْبَ لَا تَزْدَادُ اـِلَّا تَمَادِيَا<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Show thou me my weapons:&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;mayest thou have no father!&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;thou hast no father:&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.:) &lt;i&gt;verily I see the war,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;battle, increases not save in perseverance&lt;/i&gt;]. (TA.) [Aboo-&#39;Alee, as cited in the M, observes that the ا (meaning the final ا) in اَبَا, in the phrase لَا اَبَا لَكَ, indicates that it is a prefixed noun, and determinate; whereas the ل in لك together with the government exercised upon the noun by لا indicates that it is, on the contrary, indeterminate, and separate from what follows it: but it seems that he was unacquainted with the dial. var. اَبَّا; for لَا اَبَا لَكَ in the dial. of him who uses the form اَبَّا instead of اَبٌ is the same grammatically as لَا اَبَ لَكَ in the dial. of him who uses the form اَبٌ.] Suleymán Ibn-&#39;Abd-El-Melik heard an Arab of the desert, in a year of drought, say, اَنْزِلْ عَلَيْنَا الغَيْثَ لَا اَبَا لَكَ, and Suleymán put the best construction upon it, [as though it meant, &lt;i&gt;Send down upon us rain: Thou hast no father&lt;/i&gt;], and said, I testify that He hath no father nor female companion nor offspring. (TA.) They say also, in paying honour [to a person], لَا اَبَ لِشَانِيِكَ, and لَا اَبَ لِشَانِيِكَ, (TA,) i. e. &lt;i&gt;May thy hater have no father!&lt;/i&gt; or, accord. to ISk, each is a metonymical expression for لَا اَبَا لَكَ. (S in art. شنا, q. v.) ―         -b4-  One also says, on the occasion of an occurrence that is approved and commended, by way of expressing wonder and praise, لَلِّهِ اَبُوكَ, meaning &lt;i&gt;To God, purely, is attributable&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;the excellence of&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;thy father, seeing that he begat thee a generous son, and produced the like of thee!&lt;/i&gt; (TA;) [or &lt;i&gt;to God be attributed&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;the excellence of&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;thy father!&lt;/i&gt;] it means that to God [alone] belongs the power to create the like of this man [to whom it relates], from whom has proceeded this wonderful action. (Har p. 44.) ―         -b5-  And هِىَ بِنْتُ اَبِيهَا, meaning &lt;i&gt;She resembles her father in strength of mind,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;spirit, and sharpness of disposition, and in hastening,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;striving to be first, to do things:&lt;/i&gt; said of Hafsah, by &#39;Áïsheh. (TA.) ―         -b6-  بِاَبِى, (TA,) or بِاَبِى اَنْتَ, (T in art. با,) [said to a person,] means [فُدِيتَ بِاَبِى <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;Mayest thou be ransomed with my father!&lt;/i&gt; (see the next sentence but one;) or] اَفْدِيكَ بِاَبِى [&lt;i&gt;I will ransom thee with my father&lt;/i&gt;]; (T ubi suprà;) or اَنْتَ مَفْدِىٌّ بِاَبِى <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;Thou art,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;shalt be, ransomed with my father&lt;/i&gt;]; or فَدَيُتُكَ بِاَبِى [&lt;i&gt;I have&lt;/i&gt; in my heart &lt;i&gt;ransomed thee,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;I would ransom thee, with my father&lt;/i&gt;]; the ب being dependent upon a word suppressed, which, accord. to some, is a [pass. participial] noun, and accord. to others, a verb; and this word is suppressed because of the frequent usage of the phrase. (TA.) You say also, بِاَبِى اَنْتَ وَ اُمِّى [&lt;i&gt;With my father mayest thou be ransomed, and&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;my mother!&lt;/i&gt;]. (TA.) And بِاَبِى مَنْ وَدَدتُّهُ, i. e. فُدِىَ بِاَبِى مَنْ وَدَدتُّهُ [&lt;i&gt;May he whom I love be ransomed with my father!&lt;/i&gt;], meaning &lt;i&gt;may he&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;my father&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;be made a ransom for him&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;whom I love&lt;/i&gt;]! (El-Wáhidee on the Deewán of El-Mutanebbee, in De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed. vol. iii. p. 35 of the Arabic text.) Sometimes they change the ى into ا: a poet says, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        وَقَدْ زَعَمُوا اَنِّى جَزِعْتُ عَلَيْهِمَا<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        وَهَلْ جَزَعٌ اَنْ قُلْتُ وَا بِاَبَا هُمَا<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;And they have asserted that I have become impatient on account of them two: but is it&lt;/i&gt; an evidence of &lt;i&gt;impatience that I said, Alas, with my father may they two be ransomed?&lt;/i&gt;]; meaning وَا بِاَبِى هُمَا. (S.) And some of the Arabs used to say, وَا بِاَبَا اَنْتَ [&lt;i&gt;Alas, with my father mayest thou be ransomed!&lt;/i&gt;]: this, says AM, being like يَا وَيْلَتَا for يَا وَيْلَتِى; as also يَا بَيْبَا, with the hemzeh changed into ى, originally يَا بِاَبَا, meaning يَابِاَبِى: and hence what is related, in a trad., of Umm- &#39;Ateeyeh; that she used not to mention the Prophet without saying, بِيَبَا [for بِاَبِ هُوَ]. (TA in art. با.) A woman said, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        يَا بِاَبِى اَنْتَ وَ يَا فَوْقَ البِيَبْ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt; thou to whom I would say, &lt;i&gt;With my father mayest thou be ransomed! and O&lt;/i&gt; thou who art &lt;i&gt;above&lt;/i&gt; him to whom I would address &lt;i&gt;the saying, With my father mayest thou be ransomed!&lt;/i&gt;]; respecting which Fr observes that the two words [بِ and اَب] are made as one [by prefixing the article] because of their frequent occurrence; (S;) and Aboo-&#39;Alee says that the ى in بِيَب is substituted for ء, not necessarily; but ISk quotes the words as commencing with يَا بِيَبَا, which is the right reading, in order that this expression may agree with البِيَبْ, which is derived from it: EtTebreezee, however, relates Abu-l-&#39;Alà&#39;s reciting the words as ending with البِيَبْ; saying that this is compounded from the phrase بِاَبِي, and that therefore the ء is preserved. (TA.) [See also the first paragraph in art. با.] ―         -b7-  You say also, يَا اَبَتِ [meaning &lt;i&gt;O my father&lt;/i&gt;], (S, M, K,) as in يَا اَبَتِ <br>\
                  افْعَلْ [&lt;i&gt;O my father, do thou&lt;/i&gt; such a thing]; (S;) and يَا اَبَتَ; (S, M, K;) and يَااَبَتُ; (Z in the Ksh xii. 4;) and يَا اَبَهْ (S, M, K) when you pause after it. (S, M.) The ة, [here written ت,] (Kh, M,) the sign of the fem. gender, (S, Z,) is substituted for the [pronominal] affix ى, (Kh, S, M, Z,) as in يَااُمَّتِ; (S;) and is like the ة in عَمَةٌ and خَالَةٌ, as is shown by your saying, in pausing, يَا اَبَهٌ, like as you say, يَا خَالَةٌ: (Kh, M:) the annexing of the fem. ت to a masc. noun in this case is allowable, like as it is in حَمَامَةٌ ذَكَرٌ and شَاةٌ ذَكَرٌ and رَجُلٌ رَبْعَةٌ and غَلَامٌ يَفَعَةٌ: its being made a substitute for the affix ى is allowable because each of these is an augmentative added at the end of a noun: and the kesreh is the same that is in the phrase يَا اَبِى: (Z ubi suprà:) the ت does not fall from اب in the phrase يَا اَبَتِ when there is no pause after it, though it [sometimes] does from اُمّ in the like phrase in that case, because the former word, being of [only] two letters, is as though it were defective. (S.) يَا اَبَتَ is for يَا اَبَتَا, (Aboo-&#39;Othmán El-Mázinee, S, * M, [the latter expression mentioned also in the K, but not as being the original of the former,]) the ا [and ه] being suppressed; (the same Aboo- &#39;Othmán and M;) or for يَا اَبَتَا, the ا being suppressed, like as the ى is in يَا غُلَامِ; or it may be after the manner of يَااَبِىَ. (Z ubi suprà.) يَا اَبَتُ is thus pronounced after the usual manner of a noun ending with the fem. ة, without regard to the fact that the ت is in the former a substitute for the suffix ى. (Z ubi suprà.) يَا اَبَهْ is said in a case of pause, except in the Kur-án, in which, in this case, you say, يَا اَبَهْ, following the written text; and some of the Arabs pronounce the fem. ة, in a case of pause, ت [in other instances], thus saying, يَا طَلْحَتُ. (S.) يَا اَبَاهُ is also said; (M, K;) though scarcely ever. (M.) A poet uses the expression يَا اَبَاتَ, for يَا اَبَتَاهْ: (S, M:) IB says that this is used only by poetic license, in a case of necessity in verse. (TA.) ―         -b8-  اَبٌ is tropically applied to signify (tropical:)  &lt;i&gt;A grandfather,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;any ancestor.&lt;/i&gt; (Msb.) ―         -b9-  It is also applied to signify (assumed tropical:)  &lt;i&gt;A paternal uncle;&lt;/i&gt; as in the Kur ii. 127, quoted before. (M.) ―         -b10-  [It is also (like اُمّ and اِبْن and بِنْت) prefixed to nouns of various significations.
