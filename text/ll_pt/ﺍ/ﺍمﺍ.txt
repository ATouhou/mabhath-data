                     ذ<br>\
                  &lt;/form&gt;, used to denote an interrogation, is a compound of the interrogative hemzeh and the negative مَا: (M:) it is a mere interrogative [respecting a negative, like اَلَا]; as in the saying, اَمَا <br>\
                  تَسْتَحْيِى مِنَ اللّٰهِ [&lt;i&gt;Art not thou ashamed for thyself,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;of thyself, with respect to God?&lt;/i&gt;]. (Lth, T.) ―         -b2-  [IHsh says, after explaining two other usages of اَمَا which we have yet to mention,] El-Málakee adds a third meaning of اَمَا, saying that it is a particle denoting عَرْضٌ [or the asking, or requiring, a thing in a gentle manner], like [اَلَا (q. v.) and] لَوْلَا; and is connected peculiarly with a verb; as in اَمَا تَقُومُ [&lt;i&gt;Wherefore wilt not thou do stand?&lt;/i&gt;], and اَمَا تَفْعَلُ [&lt;i&gt;Wherefore wilt not thou do&lt;/i&gt; such a thing?]; which may be explained by saying that the hemzeh is used as an interrogative to make one confess, or acknowledge, a thing, as it is in اَلَمْ and اَلَا, and that مَا is a negative. (Mughnee.) ―         -b3-  It is also an inceptive word, used in the manner of اَلَا: (M:) followed by اَلَا, it is &lt;i&gt;syn. with&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  اَلَا: (S:) [meaning &lt;i&gt;Now:&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;now surely:&lt;/i&gt; or] both of these meaning &lt;i&gt;verily,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;truly;&lt;/i&gt; i. c. حَقًّا: and for this reason Sb allows one&#39;s saying, اَمَا اـنَّه مُنْطَلقٌ and اَمَا اَنَّهُ مُنْطَلقٌ [&lt;i&gt;Verily,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;truly, he is going away&lt;/i&gt;]; with kesr after the manner of اَلَا اـِنَّهُ, and with fet-h after the manner of حَقًّا اَنَّهُ: and هَمَا وَاللّٰهِ لَقَدْ كَانَ كَذَا is mentioned as meaning اَمَا وَ اللّٰهِ [&amp;amp;c., i. e. &lt;i&gt;Verily,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;truly, by God, such a thing did indeed happen&lt;/i&gt;]; the ه being a substitute for the hemzeh: (M:) so too حَمَى واللّٰه [or حَمَا واللّٰه]: (Sgh and K in art. حمى:) it denotes the truth of the words which follow it; as when you say, اَمَا اـِنَّ زَيْدًا عَاقِلٌ, meaning &lt;i&gt;Truly,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;properly speaking,&lt;/i&gt; not tropically, &lt;i&gt;Zeyd is intelligent;&lt;/i&gt; and اَمَّا و اللّٰه قَد ضَرَبَ <br>\
                  زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا [&lt;i&gt;Truly,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c., &lt;i&gt;by God, Zeyd beat,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;struck, Amr&lt;/i&gt;]: (S in art. امو:) [in other words,] it corroborates an oath and a sentence; as in &lt;pb n=&quot;93&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; <br>\
                  اَمَا وَ اللّٰه لَيِنْ سْهَرْتُ لَكَ لَيْلَةً لَاَ دَعَنَّكَ نَادِمًا [&lt;i&gt;Verily,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;now surely, by God, if I remain awake for thee a night, then will I indeed leave thee repenting&lt;/i&gt;]; and اَمَا لَو عَلِمْتُ مَكَانَكَ لَاَزْعَجْتُكَ مِنْهُ [&lt;i&gt;Verily,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;now surely, if I had known thy place of being, then had I unsettled thee,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;removed thee, from it&lt;/i&gt;]; and اَمَا اـِنَّهُ لَرَجُلٌ كَرِيمٌ [&lt;i&gt;Verily,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;now surely, he is&lt;/i&gt; (emphatically) &lt;i&gt;a generous man&lt;/i&gt;]: (T:) or it is an inceptive particle, used in the manner of اَلَا; [meaning &lt;i&gt;now:&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;now surely:&lt;/i&gt;] (Mughnee:) or a particle used to give notice of what is about to be said: only put before a proposition [as in exs. mentioned above]: (TA:) and often occurring before an oath [as in exs. mentioned above]: and sometimes its hemzeh is changed into ه or ع, before the oath; each with the ا remaining; [written هَمَا or عَمَا;] and with the ا elided; [written هَمَ or عَمَ;] or with the ا elided, but without the substitution; [written اَمَ;] and when انَّ occurs after اَمَا, it is with kesr, as it is after اَلَا: and it also means حَقًّا [&lt;i&gt;verily,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;truly&lt;/i&gt;]: or اَحقًّا [&lt;i&gt;verily?&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;truly?&lt;/i&gt;]: accord. to different opinions: and in this case, انَّ after it is with fet-h, as it is after حَقَّا: accord. to Ibn-Kharoof, this is a particle: but some say that it is a noun in the sense of حَقًّا: and others, that it consists of two words, namely, the interrogative hemzeh and مَا as a noun in the sense of شَىْءٌ; i. e. اَذالِكَ الشَّىْءُ حَقٌّ [&lt;i&gt;is that thing ture?&lt;/i&gt;]; so that the meaning is اَحَقًّا: [if so, اَمَا اَنَّه مُنْطَلقٌ means &lt;i&gt;Verily,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;truly, is he going away?&lt;/i&gt;] and this, which is what Sb says, is the correct opinion: مَا is virtually in the accus. case, as an adverbial noun, like as حَقًّا is literally: and اَنَّ with its complement is an inchoative, of which the adverbial noun is the enunciative: but Mbr says that حَقًّا is the inf. n. of يَحِقُّ, which is suppressed, and that انَّ with its complement is an agent. (Mughnee.)    &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\

                     اَمَّا<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  &lt;/form&gt; is a conditional and partitive and corroborative particle; and is sometimes written اَيْمَا, by the change of the first م into ى. (Mughnee, K.) ―         -b2-  It is used as a conditional particle in the words of the Kur [ii.24], فاَمَّا الَّذِينَ ا=مَنُوا فَيَعْلَمُونَ <br>\
                  اَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَاَمَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَيَقُولُونَ مَا <br>\
                  ذَا اَرَادَ اللّٰهُ بِهذَا مَثَلاً [&lt;i&gt;For as for those who have believed, they know that it is the truth from their Lord; but as for those who have disbelieved, they say, What is it that God meaneth by this as a  parable&lt;/i&gt;?]. (Mughnee,* K,* TA.) That it denotes a condition is shown by the necessary occurrence of ف after it; for if this ف were a conjunction, it would not be prefixed to the enunciative; and if it were redundant, it might be dispensed with; but it may not be dispensed with except in a case of necessity in poetry or in a case of an ellipsis. ―         -b3-  In most cases, (Mughnee, K,) it is used as a partitive, (S, Mughnee, K,) implying the meaning of a condition; (S; [in which it is mentioned with اَمَا;]) and thus it is used in the passage of the Kur cited above; (Mughnee;) and in the following exs. [in the Kur xviii. 78 and 79 and 81], اَمَّا السَّفِينَةُ فَكَانَتْ لِمَسَاكِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ فِى البَحْرِ and وَاَمَا الْغُلَامُ فَكَانَ اَبَوَاهُ مُوْمِنِينَ and واَمَّا الْجِدَارُ فَكَانَ <br>\
                  لِغلَامَينِ يَتَيمَيْنِ [&lt;i&gt;As for the ship, it belonged to poor men who worked on the sea . . . and as for the boy, his two parents were believers . . . and as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee, * K, * TA.) [It is a partitive also in the phrase اَمَّابَعْدُ, which see in art. بعد.] ―         -b4-  Few have mentioned its use as a corroborative: (Mughnee:) it is thus used in the phrase اَمَّا زَيْدٌ <br>\
                  فَذَاهِبٌ [&lt;i&gt;Whatever be the case,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;happen what will&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;what may,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;at all events, Zeyd is going away&lt;/i&gt;], when you mean that Zeyd is inevitably going away, and determined, or decided, upon doing so: (Z cited in the Mughnee, and K:) therefore Sb explains it as meaning, in this case, مَهْمَا يَكُنْ مِنْ شَىْءٍ [&lt;i&gt;whatever be the case,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c., as above, or, in some instances, &lt;i&gt;happen what would&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;what might&lt;/i&gt;]; thereby showing it to be a corroborative, and to have a conditional meaning: (Z cited in the Mughnee: [and the same explanation of it is given, with a similar ex., in the S, in art. امو:]) the فَ, in this case, is transferred from its proper place before the inchoative, and put before the enunciative. (I &#39;AK p. 306.) Ks says that اَمَّا is used in commanding and forbidding and announcing: you say, اَمَّا اللّٰهَ فَاعْبُدْ [&lt;i&gt;Whatever be the case,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;happen what will,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c., &lt;i&gt;God worship thou&lt;/i&gt;]: and اَمَّا الخَمْرَ فَلَا تَشْرَبْهَا [i. e. اَمَّا الخَمْرَ فَلَا تَشْرَبْهَا (as is shown in the case of a similar ex. in the Mughnee, though you may say اَمَّا الخَمْرُ فَلَا تَشْرَبْهَا, without an ellipsis, like as you say امَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ as well as اَمَّا ثَمُودَ, in the Kur xli. 16, accord. to different readers,) &lt;i&gt;Whatever be the case,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c., &lt;i&gt;wine (drink not), drink not thou it&lt;/i&gt;]: and اَمَّا زَيْدٌ فَخَرَجَ [&lt;i&gt;Whatever be the case,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c., &lt;i&gt;with respect to other things, Zeyd has gone forth;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;whatever be the case with respect to others, as for Zeyd, he has gone forth&lt;/i&gt;]: whereas اـِمَّا [which see in the next paragraph] is used in expressing a condition and in expressing doubt and in giving option and in taking option. (T.) ―         -b5-  [IHsh says that in his opinion,] in the phrase اَمَّا العَبِيدَ فَذُو عَبِيدٍ, thus heard, with العبيد in the accus. case, the meaning is, مَهَما ذَكَرْتَ [&amp;amp;c., i. e. &lt;i&gt;Whenever thou mentionest the slaves, he is a possessor of slaves:&lt;/i&gt; but I would rather say that the meaning is, اَمَّا ذِكْرُكَ <br>\
                  العَبِيدَ, &amp;amp;c., i. e. &lt;i&gt;as for thy mentioning the slaves,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.]: and so in similar phrases which have been heard. (Mughnee.)       -A2-  Distinct from the foregoing is اَمَّا in the saying in the Kur [xxvii. 86], اَمَّا ذاكُنْتُمْ تَعمَلُونَ [&lt;i&gt;Or rather, what is it that ye were doing?&lt;/i&gt;]: for here it is a compound of the unconnected اَمْ and the interrogative مَا (Mughnee.)       -A3-  So too in the saying of the poet, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اَبَا خُرَاشَةَ اَمَّا اَنْتَ ذَا نَسفَرٍ<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        فَاـنَّ قُوْمِىَ لَمْ تَاكُلْهُمُ الضَّبُعُ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;O Aboo-Khurásheh, because thou wast possessor of a number of men&lt;/i&gt; dost thou boast? &lt;i&gt;Verily, my people, the year of dearth,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;of sterility, hath not consumed them&lt;/i&gt;]: for here it is a compound of the اَنْ termed مَصُدَرِيَّة [which combines with a verb following it to form an equivalent to an inf. n.] and the redundant مَا: اَمَّا اَنْتَ is for لِاَنْ كُنْتَ; the preposition and the verb are suppressed for the sake of abridgment, so that the pronoun [تَ in كُنْتَ] becomes separate; and مَا is substituted for the verb [thus deprived of its affixed pronoun], and the ن [of ان] is incorporated into the م [of ما]. (Mughnee.) [See another reading of this verse voce اـِمَّا; and there also, immediately after, another ex. (accord. to the Mughnee) of اَمَّا used in the manner explained above. See also اَنْ as a conditional particle, like اـِنْ.]       -A4-  Also &lt;i&gt;i. q.&lt;/i&gt; <br>\

                  &lt;/form&gt; is sometimes written اَمَّا, and sometimes its first م is changed into ى, [forming اَيْمَا or اـِيْمَا or both, as will be shown below,] (Mughnee, [in my copy of which it is written اَيْمَا, and so in some copies of the K,] and K, [in some copies of which it is written اـيمَا,]) and it is held by Sb to be a compound of اـِنْ and مَا, (Mughnee,) or as denoting the complement of a condition it is a compound of اـِنْ and مَا. (M, K.) ―         -b2-  It denotes doubt; (Ks, T, Mughnee, K;) as in مَا اَدْرِى مَنْ <br>\
                  قَامَ اـِمَّا زَيْدٌواـِمَّا عَمْرٌو [&lt;i&gt;I know not who stood: either Zeyd or &#39;Amr&lt;/i&gt;]: (Ks, T:) and جَا=ءَنِى اـِمَّا <br>\
                  زَيْدٌ وَاـِمَّا عَمْرٌو [&lt;i&gt;There came to me either Zeyd or &#39;Amr&lt;/i&gt;], said when one knows not which of them came. (Mughnee, K.) ―         -b3-  It also denotes vagueness of meaning; as in [the Kur ix. 107,] اـِمَّا <br>\
                  يُعَذِّبُهُم وامَّا يَتُوبُ عَلَيْهِمْ [&lt;i&gt;Either He will punish them or He will turn unto them with forgiveness&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee, K.) ―         -b4-  It also denotes giving option; as in [the Kur xviii. 85,] اـِمَّا اَن تُعَذِّبَ واـِمَّا اَنْ <br>\
                  تَتَّخِذَ فِيِهِمْ حُسْناً [&lt;i&gt;Either do thou punish, or do thou what is good to them&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee, K.) ―         -b5-  It also denotes the making a thing allowable; as in تَعَلَّمْ اـِمَّا فِقْهًا واـِمَّا نَحْوًا [&lt;i&gt;Learn thou either low or syntax;&lt;/i&gt; (an ex. given in the T, on the authority of Ks, as an instance of the usage of اـِمَّا to denote giving option;)] but its use with this intent is disputed by some, (Mughnee, K,) while they assert it of اَوْ. (Mughnee.) ―         -b6-  It is also used as a partitive; as in [the Kur lxxvi. 3,] اـمَّا شَاكِراً و اـمَّا كَفُورًا [&lt;i&gt;Either,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;whether, being thankful or being unthankful&lt;/i&gt;]; (Mughnee, K;) the two epithets being here in the accus. case as denotatives of state: or, accord. to the Koofees, اـمَّا may be here [a compound of] the conditional اـِنْ and the redundant مَا; كَانَ, accord. to Ibn-EshShejeree, being understood after it: (Mughnee:) and Fr says that the meaning is, اـِنْ شَكَرَ وَاـِنْ كَفَرَ [&lt;i&gt;if he be thankful and if he be unthankful&lt;/i&gt;]. (T.) ―         -b7-  It also denotes taking option; as in the saying, لِى دَارٌ بِالكُوفَةِ فَانَا خَارِجٌ اـلَيْهَا فَاـمَّا اَنْ اَسْكُنَهَا واـِمَّا اَنْ <br>\
                  اَبِيعَهَا [&lt;i&gt;I have a house in El-Koofeh, and I am going forth to it, and either I will inhabit it or I will sell it:&lt;/i&gt; but this is similar to the usage first mentioned above]. (Ks, T.) ―         -b8-  It is a conjunction, (S in art. امو, and Mughnee,) accord. to most authorities, i. e., the second اـِمَّا in the like of the saying, جَاءَنِى اـمَّا زَيْدٌ واـِمَّا عَمْرٌو [mentioned &lt;pb n=&quot;94&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; above]; (Mughnee;) used in the manner of اَوْ in all its cases except this one, that in the use of او you begin with assurance, and then doubt comes upon you; whereas you begin with اـِمَّا in doubt, and must repeat it; as in the saying last mentioned: (S: [and the like is said in the Mughnee, after the explanations of the meanings:]) but some assert that it is like the first اـِمَّا, not a conjunction; because it is generally preceded by the conjunction و: and some assert that اـِمَّا conjoins the noun with the noun, and the و conjoins اـِمَّا with اـِمَّا; but the conjoining of a particle with a particle is strange. (Mughnee.) ―         -b9-  Sometimes the و is suppressed; as in the following verse, (Mughnee,) of El-Ahwas; (S;) &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        يَا لَيْتَمَا اُمُّنِا شَالَتْ نَعَامَتُهَا<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اَيْمَا اـِلَى جَنَّةٍ اَيْمَا اـِلَى نَارِ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;O, would that our mother took her departure, either to Paradise or Hell-fire!&lt;/i&gt;]; (S,* Mughnee, K;) cited by Ks, with ايما for اـِمَّا: (T:) and sometimes it is with kesr [i. e. اـِيمَا]: (S:) IB says that it is correctly اـِمَّا, with kesr; asserting the original to be اـِمَّا, with kesr, only. (TA.) ―         -b10-  And sometimes the former مَا is dispensed with; as in the following verse, (Mughnee,) which shows also that مَا is sometimes suppressed; &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        سَقَتْهُ ارَّوَاعِدُ مِنْ صَيِّفٍ<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        وَاـِنْ مِنْ خَرِيفٍ فَلَنْ يَعْدَمَا<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;The thundering clouds of summer-rain watered him, or of autumn-rain; so he will not want&lt;/i&gt; sufficient drink]: i. e. اـِمَّا مِنْ صَيِّفٍ وَاـِمَّا مِنْ <br>\
                  خَرِيفٍ. (Mughnee, K.) Mbr and As say that اـِنْ is here conditional, and that the ف is its complement: but this assertion is of no weight; for the object is the description of a mountain-goat as having sufficient drink in every case: AO says that اـِنْ in this verse is redundant. (Mughnee.) ―         -b11-  Sometimes, also, one does not require to mention the second اـِمَّا, by mentioning what supplies its place; as in the saying, اـِمَّا اَنْ تَتَكَلَّمَ بِخَيْرٍ <br>\
                  وَاـِلَّا فاسْكُتْ [&lt;i&gt;Either do thou speak what is good or else be silent&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee.) [See art. الا, near its end.]       -A2-  Distinct from the foregoing is اـِمَّا in the saying in the Kur [xix. 26], فَاـِمَّاِتَريِنَّ مِنَ <br>\
                  الْبَشَرِ اَحَدًاِ [&lt;i&gt;And if thou see, of mankind, any one&lt;/i&gt;]: for this is [a compound of] the conditional اـِن and the redundant مَا. (S * in art. امو, and Mughnee.) [In like manner,] you say, in expressing a condition, اـِمَّا تَشْتِمَنَّ زْيدًا فَاـِنَّهُ يَحْلُمُ عَنْكَ [&lt;i&gt;If thou revile Zeyd, he will treat thee with forbearance&lt;/i&gt;]. (Ks, T.) And اـِمَّا تَاْتِنِي اُكِْرِمْكَ [&lt;i&gt;If thou come to me, I will treat thee with honour&lt;/i&gt;]. (S.) ―         -b2-  In the following saying, اـِمَّا اَنْتَ مُنْطَلِقًا <br>\
                  انْطَلَقْتُ [&lt;i&gt;If thou be going away, I go away&lt;/i&gt;], the مَا is not that which restrains the particle to which it is subjoined from governing, but is a substitute for a verb; (K and TA in art. مَا;) as though the speaker said, اـِذَا صِرْتَ مُنْطَلِقًا [or rather اـِنْ صِرْتَ]. (TA in that art.) And hence the saying of the poet, [of which a reading different from that here following has been given voce اَمَّا,] &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\

                        اَبَا خُرَاشَةَ اـِمَّا اَنْتَ ذَا نَسفَرٍ<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        فَاـنَّ قَوْمِىَ لَمْ تَاـْكُلْهُمُ الضَّبُغُ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;O Aboo-Khurásheh, if thou be possessor of a number of men, verily, my people, the year of dearth,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;of sterility, hath not consumed them&lt;/i&gt;]; as though he said, اـِنْ كُنْتُ ذَا نَفَرٍ. (TA in that art.) [But IHsh states the case differently; saying,] An instance of اَمَّا اَنْتَ مُنطَلِقًا انْطَلَقْتُ not used to restrain from governing, but as a substitute for a verb, occurs in the saying, اَمَّا اَنْتَ مُنطَلِقًا اِنْطَلَقْتُ [&lt;i&gt;Because thou wast going away, I went away&lt;/i&gt;]; originally, اِنْطَلَقْتُ لِاَنْ كُنْتَ مُنطَلِقاً: [for an explanation of which, see what is said of اَمَّا اَنْتَ in a reading of the verse commencing with اَبَا خُرَاشَة voce اَمَّا:] but accord. to El-Fárisee and IJ, the government belongs to مَا; not to كَانَ [or كُنْتَ]. (Mughnee in art. مَا.) ―         -b3-  So too in the saying, اِفْعَلْ هذَا <br>\
                  اـِمَّالَا, meaning اـِنْ كُنْتَ لَاتَفْعَلُ غَيْرَهُ [i. e. &lt;i&gt;Do thou this if thou wilt not do another thing;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;do thou this at least&lt;/i&gt;]; (Mughnee and K, each in art. مَا;) indicating a person&#39;s refusal to do [fully] that which he is ordered to do: (TA in that art.:) or اـِمَّالَا فَافْعَلْ كَذَا, meaning &lt;i&gt;if thou wilt not do that, then do thou this;&lt;/i&gt; the three particles [اـِنْ and مَا and لَا] being made as one word: so says Lth: (T:) [J says,] اـِمَّالَا فَافْعَلْ كَذَا is pronounced with imáleh, [i. e. “ immá-lè, ”] and is originally اـِن لَا with مَا as a connective; and the meaning is, &lt;i&gt;if that thing will not be, then do thou thus:&lt;/i&gt; (S in art. لَا:) [but] AHát [disallows this pronunciation, and] says, sometimes the vulgar, in the place of اِفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ اـِمَّالَا, say, اِفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ بَارِى [&lt;i&gt;Do thou that at least&lt;/i&gt;]; but this is Persian, and is rejected as wrong: and they say also, اُمَّالَىْ, with damm to the ا [and with imáleh in the case of the final vowel, and thus it is vulgarly pronounced in the present day]; but this too is wrong; for it is correctly اـِمَّالَا, [with kesr, and] not pronounced with imáleh, for particles [in general] are not thus pronounced: (T:) and the vulgar also convert the hemzeh into ه with damm [saying هُمَّالَىْ]. (TA in art. مَا.) [Fei says,] لَا is a substitute for the verb in the saying, اـِمَّالَا فَافْعَلْ هٰذَا, the meaning being &lt;i&gt;If thou do not that, then&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;at least&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;do thou this:&lt;/i&gt; the origin thereof is this; that certain things are incumbent on a man to do, and he is required to do them, but refuses; and then one is content with his doing some, or a part, of them, and says to him thus: i. e., &lt;i&gt;if thou wilt not do all, then do thou this:&lt;/i&gt; then the verb is suppressed, on account of the frequency of the usage of the phrase, and مَا is added to give force to the meaning: and some say that it is for this reason that لَا is here pronounced with imáleh; because it serves for the verb; like as بَلَى is, and the vocative يَا: but it is said that it is correctly pronounced without imáleh; because particles [in general] are not pronounced therewith; as Az says. (Msb in art. لَا.) [El-Hareeree says that] اـِمَّالَا is properly [a compound of] three particles, which are اـِنْ and مَا and لَا, made as one word, and the ا at the end thereof is like the ا of حُبَارَى [in which it is written ى, agreeably with rule]; wherefore it is pronounced with imáleh, like as is the ا of this latter word. (Durrat el-Ghowwás, in De Sacy&#39;s Anthol. Gr. Ar. p. 57 of the Arabic text.) In the Lubáb it is said that لَا is used as a negative of the future, as in لا تَفْعَلْ; and the verb [in اـِمَّالَا] is suppressed; so it [لا] serves as a substitute in the saying, اِفْعَلْ هٰذَا اـِمَّالَا; therefore they pronounce its ا with imáleh: and IAth says that the Arabs sometimes pronounced لَا with a slight imáleh; and the vulgar make the imáleh thereof full, so that its ا becomes ى; but this is wrong. (TA.) You say also, خُذْ هٰذَا اـِمَّالَا, meaning &lt;i&gt;Take thou this if thou take not that.&lt;/i&gt; (T.) It is related that the Prophet saw a runaway camel, and said, “ To whom belongeth this camel? ” when, lo, some young men of the Ansár said, “ We have drawn water upon him during twenty years, and yet he has in him fat; so we desired to slaughter him; but he escaped from us. ” He said, “ Will ye sell him? ” They answered, “ No: but he is thine. ” And he said, اـِمَّالَا فاَحْسِنُوا اـِلَيْهِ <br>\
                  حَتَّى ياْتِيَهُ اَجَلُهُ, meaning &lt;i&gt;If ye will not sell him, act well to him until his term of life come to him.&lt;/i&gt; (T.)   &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\
