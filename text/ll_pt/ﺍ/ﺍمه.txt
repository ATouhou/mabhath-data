                  &lt;/form&gt;, inf. n. اَمَهٌ, &lt;i&gt;He forgot.&lt;/i&gt; (S, K.) Hence the reading of I&#39;Ab, [in the Kur xii. 45,] وَادَّكَرَ بَعْدَ اَمَهٍ [&lt;i&gt;And he remembered,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;became reminded, after forgetting&lt;/i&gt;]. (S.) AHeyth is said to have read بَعْدَ اَمْهٍ; and accord. to AO, اَمْهٌ signifies نِسْيَانٌ [like اَمَهٌ]; but this is not correct. (Az, TA.) ―         -b2-  &lt;i&gt;He confessed,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;acknowledged:&lt;/i&gt; (S, K:) occurring in this sense in a trad. of Ez-Zuhree; but not well known. (S.) The reading of I&#39;Ab, mentioned above, بَعْدَ اَمَهٍ, is explained by A&#39;Obeyd as meaning &lt;i&gt;after confessing,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;acknowledging.&lt;/i&gt; (TA.)    &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\

[of the former] is اُمَّهَاتٌ and [that of the latter is] اُمَّاتٌ: (T, S:) Az says that the امو is added in the former for the purpose of distinguishing between the daughters of Adam [to whom it is generally applied] and other animate beings.
