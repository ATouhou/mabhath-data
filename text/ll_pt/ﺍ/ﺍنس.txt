      اـِنْسَانٌ, Lh, S, M, Msb) اَنَاسِىٌّ, (Lh, S, M, Msb, K,) like as كَرَاسِىُّ is pl. of كُرْسِىٌّ, or like as سَرَاحينُ is pl. of سِرحَانٌ, but ى being substituted for ن, (M, TA,) after the same manner as they say اَرَانٍ for اَرَانِبُ; (Fr, TA;) and اَنَاسٍ, (Lh, M,) in the accus. case اَنَاسِىَ, as the word is read in the Kur xxv. 51, by Ks, (TA,) and by Yahyà Ibn-El-Hárith, (K, TA,) dropping the ى between the second and last radical letters, [for, with some others, it seems, they held the word to be derived from the root نسى,] (TA,) and اَنَاسِيَةٌ, (S, M, K,) in which the ة is a substitute for one of the two yás in اَنَاسِىُّ, a pl. of اـِنْسَانٌ; or, accord. to Mbr, اَنَاسِيَةٌ is pl. of اـِنْسِىٌّ, [in the TA, of اـِنْسِيَّةٌ, which I regard as a mistranscription,] and is like زَنَادَقَةٌ for زَنَادِيقُ, and فَرَازِتَةٌ for فَرَازِينُ; (M, TA;) and you say also اـِنْسَيُّونَ. (TA.) نَاسٌ is masc., as in the Kur ii. 19, &amp;amp;c.; and sometimes fem., as meaning &lt;i&gt;A tribe,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;a body of men,&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  قَبِيلَةٌ, or طَايِفَةٌ; as in the phrase, mentioned by Th, جَا=ءَتَْكَ النَّاسُ, meaning, &lt;i&gt;The tribe,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;portion of people&lt;/i&gt; (قِطْعَة), &lt;i&gt;came to thee.&lt;/i&gt; (M, TA.) ↓ <br>\
      بَنُوالاـِنْسَانِ means &lt;i&gt;The sons of Adam.&lt;/i&gt; (M.) And النَّاسُ النَّاسُ, an expression mentioned by Sb, means, &lt;i&gt;Men in every place and in every state are men:&lt;/i&gt; a poet says, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\

                  &lt;/quote&gt; meaning [&lt;i&gt;A country in which we were, and which we used to love,] since the men were ingenuous men, and the country was a fruitful country.&lt;/i&gt; (M.) The following trad., لَوْ اَطَاعَ اْللّٰهُ <br>\
                  النَّاسَ فِى النَّاسِ لَمْ يَكُنْ نَاسٌ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;If God complied with the prayer of men with respect to men there would be no men,&lt;/i&gt; is said to mean, that men love to have male children born to them, and not females, and if there were no females, or if the females were not, men would cease to be. (TA.) It is related that a party of the jinn, or genii, came to a company of men, and asked permission to go in to them, whereupon the latter said to them, Who are ye? and they answered, نَاسٌ مِنَ <br>\
                  الجنِّ [&lt;i&gt;A people of the jinn&lt;/i&gt;], making their answer to accord. with common usage; for it is customary for men, when it is said to them, Who are ye? to answer, نَاسٌ مِنْ بَنِى فُلَانٍ [&lt;i&gt;Men of the sons of such a one&lt;/i&gt;]. (IJ, M, L: but in the L, for ناس, in both instances, we find اُنَاسٌ.) [See also نَاسٌ in art. نوس.] Respecting the derivation of ↓ <br>\
      اـِنْسَانٌ, authors differ, though they agree that the final ن is augmentative: the Basrees say that it is from الاـِنْسُ; (Msb;) and its measure is فِعْلَانٌ; (S, Msb;) but an addition, of ى, is made in its dim., [which is اُنَيْسِيَانٌ,] like as an addition is made in رُوَيْجِلٌ, the dim. of رَجُلٌ: (S:) [but it should be observed that رُوَيْجِلٌ is more probably the dim. of رَاجِلٌ:] some say that it is from اـِينَاسٌ, signifying “perception,” or “sight,” and “knowledge,” and “sensation;” because man uses these faculties: (TA:) and Mohammad Ibn-&#39;Arafeh El-Wásitee says that men are called اـِنسِيُّونِ because they are seen (يُوْنَسُونَ, i. e.    &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\

                  &lt;/form&gt;), and that the jinn are called جِنّ because they are [ordinarily] concealed (مُجْتَنُّونَ, i. e. مُتَوَارُونَ,) from the sight of men: (TA:) [it is said in the B, as cited in the TA, that the form اَنِسَان is also used for اـِنْسَانٌ; as though it were a dual, meaning “a double associate,” i. e., an associate with the jinn and with his own kind; for it is added, اَنِسَ بِاْلا=ْجِنِّ وَاَنِسَ بِاْلا=ْخَلْقِ:] some derive the word from النَّوْسُ, signifying “motion:” (TA:) some (namely, the Koofees, Msb) say that it is originally اـِنسِيَانٌ, (S, Msb, TA,) of the measure اـِفْعِلَانٌ, (S, Msb,) from النِّسْيَانُ [“forgetfulness”], (Msb,) and contracted to make it more easy of pronunciation, because of its being so often used; (S;) but it is restored to its original in forming the dim., (S, Msb,) which is اُنَيْسِيَانٌ: (Msb, TA:) this form of the dim., they say, shows the original form of the word which is its source; (TA;) and they adduce as an indication of its derivation the saying of I&#39;Ab, اـِنَّمَا سُمِّيَ <br>\
