                  &lt;/form&gt; a conjunction, (M, Mughnee, K,) to which the later authors have ascribed meanings amounting to twelve: (Mughnee:) a particle which, when occurring in an enunciative phrase, [generally] denotes doubt, and vagueness of meaning; and when occurring in an imperative or a prohibitive phrase, [generally] denotes the giving of option, or choice, and the allowing a thing, or making it allowable. (S.) ―         -b2-  First, (Mughnee,) it denotes doubt. (T, S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K.) So in the saying, رَاَيْتُ زَيْدًا اَوْ عَمْرًا [&lt;i&gt;I saw Zeyd or &#39;Amr&lt;/i&gt;]. (T, * S, Msb.) And جَا=نِى رَجُلٌ اَوِ اْمْرَاَةٌ [&lt;i&gt;A man or a woman came to me&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mbr, T.) And لَبِيْنَا يَوْمًا اَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ [in the Kur xviii. 18 and xxiii. 115, &lt;i&gt;We have remained a day or part of a day&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee.) ―         -b3-  Secondly, (Mughnee,) it denotes vagueness of meaning. (S, Msb, Mughnee, K.) S [it may be used] in the first of the .exs. given above. (Msb.) And so in the saying, وَاَنَّا اَوْ اـِيَّاكُمْ لَعَلَى هُدًي اَوْ فِى ضَلَالٍ مُبِينٍ [&lt;i&gt;And verily we or ye are following a right direction or in manifest error&lt;/i&gt;], (S, Mughnee,) in the Kur [xxxiv. 23]; (S;) the ex. being in the former او. (Mughnee.) ―         -b4-  Thirdly, (Mughnee,) it denotes the giving of option, or choice. (T, S, M, Mughnee, K.) So in the saying, كُلِ السَّمَكَ اَوِ اْشْرَبِ <br>\
                  اللَّبَنَ [&lt;i&gt;Eat thou the fish, or drink thou the milk&lt;/i&gt;]; i. e. do not thou both of these actions; (Mbr, T, S;) but choose which of them thou wilt. (Mbr, T.) And تَزَوَّجْ هِنْدًا اَوْ اُخْتَهَا [&lt;i&gt;Take thou as wife Hind or her sister&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee.) And [in like manner] it denotes the making choice. (T.) [So when you say, سَاَتَزَوَّجُ هِنْدًا اَوْ اُخْتَهَا, meaning &lt;i&gt;I will take as wife Hind or her sister;&lt;/i&gt; whichever of them I choose.] ―         -b5-  Fourthly, (Mughnee,) it denotes the allowing a thing, or making it allowable. (T, S, Msb, Mughnee, K.) So in the saying, جَالِسِ حَسَنَ اَوِ اْبْنَ سِيرِينَ [&lt;i&gt;Sit thou with El- Hasan or Ibn-Seereen&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mbr, T, S.) And قُمْ اَوِ اْقْعُدْ [&lt;i&gt;Stand thou or sit&lt;/i&gt;]: and the person to whom this is said may do [one or] both of the se actions. (Msb.) [And similar exs. are given in the Mughnee.]) But وَلَا تُطِعْ مِنْهُمْ ا=ثِمًا <br>\
                  اَو كَفُورًا [in the Kur lxxvi. 24, &lt;i&gt;And obey not thou, of them, a sinner or a person very ungrateful to God,&lt;/i&gt;] means that thou shalt not obey either of such persons: (Mbr, T, Mughnee:) in which case او is more forcible than وَ; for when you say to a person, لَا تُطِعْ زَيْدًا وَعَمْرًا [&lt;i&gt;Obey not thou Zeyd and &#39;Amr&lt;/i&gt;], he may obey one of them, since the command is that he shall not obey the two. (Zj, T.) ―         -b6-  Fifthly, (Mughnee,) it denotes unrestricted conjunction. (Mughnee, K.) So in the saying, in the Kur [iv. 46 and v. 9], اَوْ جَا=ءَ <br>\
                  اَحَدٌ مِنْكُمْ مِنَ الغَايِطِ [&lt;i&gt;And&lt;/i&gt; if &lt;i&gt;any one of you cometh from the privy&lt;/i&gt;]; (TA;) [where, however, it may also be rendered &lt;i&gt;or,&lt;/i&gt; though] meaning وَجَا=ءَ; (T, TA;) the و in this explanation being what is termed a denotative of state. (T.) So, too, accord. to AZ, in the expression اَوْ يَزِيدُونَ [&lt;i&gt;And they exceeded&lt;/i&gt; that number], in the Kur [xxxvii. 147]: but see below. (TA.) And so in the words, اَوْ اَنْ نَفْعَلَ فِى اَمْوَالِنَا مَا نَشَا=ءُ [&lt;i&gt;And our doing, in respect of our possessions, what we will&lt;/i&gt;], in the Kur [xi. 89]. (T, TA.) ―         -b7-  Sixthly, it denotes transition, (Mughnee,) used in the sense of [the adversative particle] بَلْ, (T, S, M, Mughnee, K,) in a case of amplification of speech; (S;) accord. to Sb, on two conditions; that it shall be preceded by a negation or a prohibition, and that the agent shall be mentioned a second time; as in مَا قَامَ زَيْدٌ اَوْ مَا قَامَ عَمْرٌو [&lt;i&gt;Zeyd did not stand: nay, rather &#39;Amr did not stand&lt;/i&gt;]; and لَا يَقْمٌ زَيدٌ اَوْ لَا يَقُمْ عَمْرُو [&lt;i&gt;Let not Zeyd stand: nay, rather let not &#39;Amr stand&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee.) Accord. to Fr, (Th, M, Mughnee,) it has this meaning in اَوْ يَزِيدُونَ [&lt;i&gt;Nay, rather they exceeded&lt;/i&gt; that number], (Th, S, M, Mughnee,) in the Kur [xxxvii. 147, cited above]: (S:) or the meaning is, &lt;i&gt;or they would exceed&lt;/i&gt; [that number] in your estimation: or these words with those preceding them in the same verse mean, we sent him to a multitude of whom, if ye saw them, ye would say, They are a hundred thousand, &lt;i&gt;or they exceed&lt;/i&gt; [that number]; (M, Mughnee; *) so that it denotes doubt on the part of men, not of God, for He is not subject to doubt: (M:) or we sent him to a hundred thousand in the estimation of men, &lt;i&gt;or they exceeded&lt;/i&gt; [that number] in the estimation of men; for God does not doubt: (S:) or او is here used to denote vagueness of meaning: (IB, Mughnee:) or, it is said, to denote that a person might choose between saying, “they are a hundred thousand,“ and saying, “they are more;“ but this may not be when one of the two things is the fact: or, accord. to some of the Koofees, it has the meaning of وَ: and each of these meanings, except the last, has been assigned to او as occurring in the Kur ii. 69 and xvi. 79. (Mughnee.) ―         -b8-  Seventhly, it denotes division; (Mughnee, K; *) as in the saying, الكَلِمَةُ اْسْمٌ اَوْ فِعْلٌ اَوْ حَرْفٌ [&lt;i&gt;The word is a noun or a verb or a particle&lt;/i&gt;]: so said Ibn-Málik: or, as he afterwards said, in preference, it denotes separation (التَّفرِيق) divested of the attribute of denoting doubt and vagueness of meaning and the giving of option or choice; adducing as one of his exs. of this meaning the saying, وَقَالُوا كُونُوا هُودًا اَوْ نَصَارَى [in the Kur ii. 129, &lt;i&gt;And they said, “Be ye Jews” or “Christians”&lt;/i&gt;]; because the use of و in division is better; as when you say, الكَلِمَةُ اْسْمٌ وَفِعْلٌ وَحَرْفٌ: or it denotes, accord. to some, distinction (التَّفْصِيل); and the meaning of the ex. last cited, say they, is, &lt;i&gt;and the Jews said, “Be ye Jews,” and the Christians said, “Be ye Christians.”&lt;/i&gt; (Mughnee.) It is [said to be] used in this last sense (that of التفضيل) in the saying, كُنْتُ ا=كُلُ اللَّحْمَ اَوِ العَسَلَ [&lt;i&gt;I used to eat flesh-meat or honey&lt;/i&gt;]; i. e. &lt;i&gt;I used to eat flesh-meat one time and honey another time:&lt;/i&gt; and so in the Kur vii. 3 and x. 13. ―         -b9-  Eighthly, (Mughnee,) it is used in the sense of the exceptive اـِلَّا, (Mughnee, K,) or اـِلَّا اَنْ (M;) and in this case the aor. after it is mansoob, because of اَنْ suppressed. (Mughnee, K.) So in the saying, لَاَقْتُلَنَّهُ اَوْ يُسْلِمَ [&lt;i&gt;I will assuredly slay him or he shall become a Muslim;&lt;/i&gt; i. e., &lt;i&gt;unless he become a Muslim&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee. [And a similar ex. is given in the M.]) So, too, in the saying, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        وَكُنْتُ اـِذَا غَمَزْتُ قَنَاةَ قَوْمٍ<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        كَسَرْتُ كُعُوبَهَا اَوْ تَسْتَقِيمَا<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;And I used, when I pinched and pressed the spear of a people, to break its knots,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;joints,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;its internodal portions,&lt;/i&gt; (the shaft being a cane,) &lt;i&gt;or,&lt;/i&gt; i. e. &lt;i&gt;unless, it became straight&lt;/i&gt;]: (Mughnee, K: *) a prov., of which the author is Ziyád ElAajam; meaning, when a people behaved with hardness to me, I endeavoured to soften them: (TA in art. غمز:) thus related by Sb, the verb ending it being rendered mansoob by او; and thus he heard it from some one or more of the Arabs; but in the original verses, which are but three, it is تَسْتَقِيمُ, with refa. (IB and TA in art. غمز.) [And similar to these above are the sayings,] اـنَّهُ <br>\
                  لِفُلَانٍ اَوْمَا بِنَجْدٍ قَرظَهُ [&lt;i&gt;Verily it belongs to such a one or there is not,&lt;/i&gt; i. e. &lt;i&gt;unless there be not, in Nejd, a&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  قَرَظَة (see art. قرظ)]: and لَا=تِيَنَّكَ اَوْ مَا <br>\
                  بِنَجْدٍ قَرَظَةٌ [&lt;i&gt;I will assuredly come to thee or there&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  &lt;pb n=&quot;123&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;is not,&lt;/i&gt; i. e. &lt;i&gt;unless there be not, in Nejd, a&lt;/i&gt; <br>\
                  قَرَظَة]; meaning &lt;i&gt;I will assuredly come to thee, in truth.&lt;/i&gt; (T.) ―         -b10-  Ninthly, (Mughnee,) it is used in the sense of اـِلَى, (Mughnee, K,) or اـِلَى اَنْ; (S;) in which case also the aor. after it is mansoob, because of اَنْ suppressed: (Mughnee:) and in the sense of حَتَّى [which is also syn. with اـِتَى]. (Fr, T, M, K.) So in the saying, لَاَضْرِبَنَّهُ اَوْ يَتُوبَ [&lt;i&gt;I will assuredly beat him until he repent&lt;/i&gt;]. (S. [And similar exs. of او as explained by حَتَّي are given in the T (from Fr) and in the M and in the Mughnee.]) And so in the saying of the poet, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        لَاَسْتَسْهِلَنَّ الصَّعْبَ اَوْ اُدْرِكَ المُنَى<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        فَمَا اْنْقَادَتِ الا=مَالُ اـِلَّا لِصَابِرِ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;I will assuredly deem easy what is difficult until I attain the objects of wish; for hopes become not easy of accomplishment save to one who is patient&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee.) ―         -b11-  Tenthly, some say, (Mughnee,) it denotes nearness [of one event or thing to another]; as in the saying, مَا اَدْرِى <br>\
                  اَسَلَّمَ اَوْ وَدَّعَ [&lt;i&gt;I know not whether he saluted or bade farewell&lt;/i&gt;]: (Mughnee, K: [but in the CK this ex. is misplaced:]) this, however, is manifestly wrong; او being here used to denote doubt, and the denoting of nearness being only inferred from the fact of the saluting being confounded in the mind with the bidding farewell, since this is impossible or improbable when the two times are far apart. (Mughnee.) ―         -b12-  Eleventhly, (Mughnee,) it occurs as a conditional, (T, Mughnee, K,) accord. to Ks alone; (T;) or rather as a conjunctive and conditional; وَاـِنْ being meant to be understood in its place; though in truth the verb that precedes it indicates that the conditional particle [اـِنْ] is meant to be understood [before that verb], and او retains its proper character, but forms part of that which has a conditional meaning because conjoined with a preceding conditional phrase. (Mughnee.) So in the saying, لَاَضْرِبَنَّهُ عَاشَ اَوْ مَاتَ, (Mughnee, K,) i. e., اـِنْ <br>\
                  عَاِض بَعْدَ الضَّرْبِ وَ اـِنْ مَاتَ [&lt;i&gt;I will assuredly beat him if he live&lt;/i&gt; (after the beating) &lt;i&gt;or if he die&lt;/i&gt;]: so says Ibn-Esh-Shejeree. (Mughnee.) ―         -b13-  Twelfthly, accord. to Ibn-Esh-Shejeree, on the authority of some one or more of the Koofees, (Mughnee,) it denotes division into parts, or portions; as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 129, before cited,] وَقَالُوا كُونُوا هُودًا اَو نَصَارَى, (Mughnee, K,) i. e. &lt;i&gt;And they said, “Be ye, some of you, Jews, and, some of you, Christians:&lt;/i&gt;” (TA:) but [IHsh says,] it appears to me that the meaning here is that of التَّفْصِيل mentioned before. (Mughnee.) ―         -b14-  [In the K it is said to occur also in the sense of اَنْ: but this is evidently a mistake, app. originating in one of the two principal sources of the K, namely, the M, in which the same is said, but is exemplified by a phrase in which it is explained by اـِلَّا اَنْ, the eighth of the meanings of اَوْ mentioned above.] ―         -b15-  See also اَوٌّ below.    &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\
