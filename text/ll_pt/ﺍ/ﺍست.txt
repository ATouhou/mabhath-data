(K.) [It is of the fem. gender.] It is said in a prov., applied to him who fails of attaining the object that he seeks, اَخْطَاَتِ اْسْتُهُ الحُفْرَةَ [&lt;i&gt;His anus missed the hole in the ground&lt;/i&gt;]. (Meyd.) — [Hence,] اِسْتُ الدَّهْرِ (tropical:)  &lt;i&gt;The first,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;beginning, of time;&lt;/i&gt; (A;) &lt;i&gt;old,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;ancient, time.&lt;/i&gt; (IB, A, * K. *) One says, مَا زَالَ عَلَى اْسْتِ الدَّهْرِ مَجْنُونًا (tropical:)  [&lt;i&gt;He ceased not,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;has not ceased, from the beginning of time,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;from old time, to be insane,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;mad;&lt;/i&gt; or] &lt;i&gt;he always was,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;always has been, known as being insane,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;mad:&lt;/i&gt; like as one says, عَلَى اـِسِّ <br>\

                  &lt;/quote&gt; (tropical:)  [&lt;i&gt;He ceased not,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;has not ceased, to be, since he was in the beginning of time,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;in old time,&lt;/i&gt; i. e., &lt;i&gt;from the first of his existence, a person of increasing foolishness, and of decreasing intellect&lt;/i&gt;]. (AZ, S.) IB says, J has erred in mentioning است in this section [of the S]; its proper place being in art. سته, where he has also mentioned it; for its hemzeh is conjunctive, by common consent; and if conjunctive, it is augmentative: also, his saying that they have changed the [final] س in اـِسٌّ into ت, like as they have changed the [final] س of طَسٌّ into ت, making this word طَسْتٌ, is a mistake; for, were it so, the hemzeh of است would be disjunctive [in every case; whereas it is always conjunctive except after a pause, when it is pronounced with kesr]: moreover, he has attributed this assertion to AZ, who never made it, but only mentioned است الدهر with اسّ الدهر because of their agreement in meaning. (TA.) ―         -b2-  [Hence also,] اِسْتُ الكَلْبَةِ (assumed tropical:)  &lt;i&gt;Calamity,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;misfortune:&lt;/i&gt; (K:) &lt;i&gt;adversity; difficulty; distress; affliction:&lt;/i&gt; (TA:) &lt;i&gt;what is hated, disliked, disapproved, foul, abominable,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;evil.&lt;/i&gt; (K.) ―         -b3-  And اِسْتُ المَتْنِ (assumed tropical:)  &lt;i&gt;The desert:&lt;/i&gt; (K:) or &lt;i&gt;the wide desert.&lt;/i&gt; (TA.) ―         -b4-  See also art. سته.    &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\
