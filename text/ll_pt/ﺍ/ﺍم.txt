                     ذ<br>\
                  &lt;/form&gt; is a conjunction, (S, M, K,) connected with what precedes it (Msb, Mughnee) so that neither what precedes it nor what follows it is independent, the one of the other. (Mughnee.) It denotes interrogation; (M, K;) or is used in a case of interrogation, (S, Msb,) corresponding to the interrogative اَ, and meaning اَىّ, (S,) or, as Z says, اَىُّ الاَمْرَيْنِ كَايِنٌ; [for an explanation of which, see what follows;] (Mughnee;) or, [in other words,] corresponding to the interrogative اَ, whereby, and by اَمْ, one seeks, or desires, particularization: (Mughnee:) it is as though it were an interrogative after an interrogative. (Lth, T.) Thus you say, اَزَيُدٌ فِى الدَّارِ اَمْ عَمْرٌو [&lt;i&gt;Is Zeyd in the house, or &#39;Amr?&lt;/i&gt;]; (S, Mughnee;) i. e. which of them two (اَيُّهُمَا) is in the house? (S;) therefore what follows ام and what precedes it compose one sentence; and it is not used in commanding nor in forbidding; and what follows it must correspond to what precedes it in the quality of noun and of verb; so that you say, اَزَيْدٌ قَايِمٌ اَمع قَاعِدٌ [&lt;i&gt;Is Zeyd standing, or sitting?&lt;/i&gt;] and اَقَامَ زَيْدٌ اَمْ <br>\
                  قَعَدَ [&lt;i&gt;Did Zeyd stand, or sit?&lt;/i&gt;]. (Msb.) It is not to be coupled with اَ after it: you may not say, اَعِنْدَكَ زَيْدٌ اَمْ اَعِنْدَكَ عَمْرٌو. (S.) ―         -b2-  As connected in like manner with what goes before, it is preceded by اَ denoting equality [by occurring after سَوَا=ءٌ &amp;amp;c.], and corresponds thereto, as in [the Kur lxiii. 6,] سَوَا=ءُ عَلَيْهِمْ اَسْتَغْفَرْتَ لَهُمٌ لَمٌ تَسْتَغُفِرْ لَهُمٌ [It will be &lt;i&gt;equal to them whether thou beg forgiveness for them or do not beg forgiveness for them&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee.) ―         -b3-  It is also unconnected with what precedes it, (S, Msb, Mughnee,) implying always digression, (Mughnee,) preceded by an enunciative, or an interrogative, (S, Msb, Mughnee,) other than اَ, (Mughnee,) or by اَ not meant [really] as an interrogative but to denote disapproval, (Mughnee,) and signifies بَلْ, (Lth, Zj, T, S, M, Mughnee, K,) or بَلْ and اَ together, (Msb,) and this is its meaning always accord. to all the Basrees, but the Koofees deny this. (Mughnee.) Thus, using it after an enunciative, you say, اـِنَّهَا لَاـِبِلٌ اَمْ شَا=ءٌ [&lt;i&gt;Verily they are camels: nay,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;nay but, they are sheep,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;goats:&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;nay, are they sheep,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;goats?&lt;/i&gt;]: (S Msb, Mughnee:) this being said when one looks at a bodily form, and imagines it to be a number of camels, and says what first occurs to him; then the opinion that it is a number of sheep or goats suggests itself to him, and he turns from the first idea, and says, اَمْ شَا=ءٌ, meaning بَلْ, because it is a digression from what precedes it; though what follows بل is [properly] a thing known certainly, and what follows ام is opined. (S, TA.) And using it after an interrogative in this case, you say, هَلْ زيْدٌ <br>\
                  مُنْطَلِقٌ اَمْ عَمْرٌو [&lt;i&gt;Is Zeyd going away? Nay rather,&lt;/i&gt; or, &lt;i&gt;or rather, is &#39;Amr?&lt;/i&gt;]: you digress from the question respecting Zeyd&#39;s going away, and make the question to relate to &#39;Amr; so that ام implies indecisive opinion, and interrogation, and digression. (S.) And thus using it, you say, هَلْ زَيْدٌ <br>\
                  قَامَ اَمْ عَمْرٌو [&lt;i&gt;Did Zeyd stand? Nay rather,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;or rather, did &#39;Amr?&lt;/i&gt;]. (Msb.) And an ex. of the same is the saying [in the Kur xiii. 17], هَلْ يَسْتَوِى الْاَعْمَى وَالْبَصِيرُ اَمْ هَلْ تَسْتَوِى الظُّلُمَاتُ <br>\
                  وَالنُّورُ [&lt;i&gt;Are the blind and the seeing equal? Or rather are darkness and light equal?&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mughnee.) And an ex. of it preceded by اَ used to denote disapproval is the saying [in the Kur vii. 194], اَلَهُمْ اَرْجُلٌ يَمْشُونَ بِهَا اَمْ لَهُمْ اَيْدٍ يَبْطِشُونَ بِهَا [&lt;i&gt;Have they feet, to walk therewith? Or have they hands to assault therewith?&lt;/i&gt;]: for اَ is here equivalent to a negation. (Mughnee.) [It has been shown above that] اَمْ is sometimes introduced immediately before هَلْ: (S, K:) but IB says that this is when هل occurs in a phrase next before it; [as in the ex. from the Kur xiii. 17, cited above;] and in this case, the interrogative meaning of ام is annulled; it being introduced only to denote a digression. (TA.) ―         -b4-  It is also used as a simple interrogative; accord. to the assertion of AO; in &lt;pb n=&quot;89&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; the sense of هَلْ; (Mughnee;) or in the sense of the interrogative اَ; (Lth, T, K) as in the saying, اَمْ عِنْدَكَ غَدَا=ءِ حَاضِرٌ, meaning &lt;i&gt;Hast thou a morning-meal ready?&lt;/i&gt; a good form of speech used by the Arabs; (Lth, T;) and allowable when preceded by another phrase. (T.) ―         -b5-  And sometimes it is redundant; (AZ, T, S, Mughnee, K) in the dial. of the people of El-Yemen; (T;) as in the saying, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        يَا دَهْنَ اَمْ مَا كَانَ مَشْيِى رقَصَا<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        بَلْ قَدْ تَكُونُ مِشْيَتِى تَوَقُّصَا<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; (T, S, * [in the latter, يا هِنْدُ, and only the former hemistich is given,]) meaning &lt;i&gt;O Dahnà,&lt;/i&gt; (the curtailed form دَهْنَ being used for دَهْنَا=ء,) &lt;i&gt;my walking was not,&lt;/i&gt; as now in my age, [a feeble movement like] &lt;i&gt;dancing: but&lt;/i&gt; in my youth, &lt;i&gt;my manner of walking used to be a bounding:&lt;/i&gt; (T:) this is accord. to the opinion of AZ: but accord. to another opinion, ام is here [virtually] conjoined with a preceding clause which is suppressed; as though the speaker had said, يَا دَهْنَ اَكَانَ مَشْيِى <br>\
                  رَقَصَّا اَمْ مَا كَانَ كَذلِكَ. (A &#39;Hát, TA.)       -A2-  It is also used (T, Mughnee) in the dial. of the people of El-Yemen, (T,) or of Teiyi and Himyer, (Mughnee,) in the sense of ال, (T,) to render a noun determinate. (Mughnee.) So in the trad., لَيْسَ مِنَ امْبِرّ امْصِيامُ فِى امْسَفَرِ, (T, Mughnee,) i. e. الَيْسَ مِنَ البِرِّ الصِّيَامُ فِى السَّفَرِ [&lt;i&gt;Fasting in journeying is not&lt;/i&gt; an act &lt;i&gt;of obedience&lt;/i&gt; to God]. (T, and M in art. بر.) So too in the trad., اَلْا=نَ <br>\
                  طَابَ امْضَرْبُ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;Now fighting has become lawful;&lt;/i&gt; as related accord. to the dial. of Himyer, for الضَّرْبُ. (TA in art. طيب.) It has been said that this form ام is only used in those cases in which the ل of the article does not become incorporated into the first letter of the noun to which it is prefixed; as in the phrase, خُذِ الرُّمْحَ وَارْكَبِ امْفَرَسَ [&lt;i&gt;Take thou the spear, and mount the mare,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;horse&lt;/i&gt;], related as heard in El-Yemen; but this usage may be peculiar to some of the people of that country; not common to all of them; as appears from what we have cited above.

Mohammad was termed اُمِّىّ [meaning &lt;i&gt;A Gentile,&lt;/i&gt; as distinguished from an Israelite: or, accord. to most of his followers, meaning &lt;i&gt;illiterate;&lt;/i&gt;] because the nation (اُمَّة) of the Arabs did not write, nor read writing; and [they say that] God sent him as an apostle when he did not write, nor read from a book; and this natural condition of his was one of his miraculous signs, to which reference is made in the Kur [xxix. 47], where it is said, “thou didst not read, before it, from a book, nor didst thou write it with thy right hand:” (T, TA:) but accord. to the more correct opinion, he was not well acquainted with written characters nor with poetry, but he discriminated between good and bad poetry: or, as some assert, he became acquainted with writing after he had been unacquainted therewith, on account of the expression “ before it ” in the verse of the Kur mentioned above: or, as some say, this may mean that he wrote though ignorant of the art of writing, like as some of the kings, being اُمِّيُّون, write their signs, or marks: (TA:) or, accord. to Jaafar Es-Sádik, he used to read from the book, or scripture, if he did not write.
