                  &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; (a man, M) &lt;i&gt;returned,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;reverted, from it.&lt;/i&gt; (M, K.) ―         -b2-  From ا=لَ as syn. with رَجَعَ is the phrase, فُلَانٌ يَوُولُ اـِلَى كَرَمٍ [meaning either &lt;i&gt;Such a one returns to generosity,&lt;/i&gt; or, as كَرَمٌ is used in the sense of كِرَامٌ, &lt;i&gt;is referable to generous,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;noble, ancestors&lt;/i&gt;].

[In the Mgh, art. دهر, for ا=ل I find اَفْطَرَ; and it is there said that this is an imprecation uttered by the Prophet, lest a man should believe &lt;pb n=&quot;126&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; this kind of fasting to be ordained by God; or, through impotence, should become insincere; or because, by fasting all the days of the year, he would do so on the days on which fasting is forbidden.

(Msb.)       -A2-  ا=لَهُ: see 2. ―         -b2-  Accord. to Lth, (TA,) اُلْتُهُ, (M, K,) aor. اَوُولُهُ, inf. n. اَوْلٌ, (TA,) signifies &lt;i&gt;I made it&lt;/i&gt; (namely, milk, M, or oil &amp;amp;c., K) &lt;i&gt;to thicken,&lt;/i&gt; (M, K,) &lt;i&gt;and to coagulate;&lt;/i&gt; (M;) the verb being both intrans. and trans.: (K:) but Az says that it is not known as trans., in this sense, in the language of the Arabs [of the classical ages].

[But see another reading in the first paragraph of art. اوي.]) You say also, اُلْتُ الشَّىْءَ meaning &lt;i&gt;I composed,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;collected together, the thing, and put it into a good, right,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;proper, state,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;condition:&lt;/i&gt; and some of the Arabs say, اْللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ ↓ <br>\

      تاَوُّلٌ: (T:) or the &lt;i&gt;turning a verse of the Kur-án from its apparent meaning to a meaning which it bears,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;admits, when the latter is agreeable with the Scripture and the Sunneh:&lt;/i&gt; for instance, in the words of the Kur [vi. 95, &amp;amp;c.], يُخْرِجُ اْلْحَىَّ مِنَ المَيِّتِ, if the meaning be [thus explained] “He produceth the bird from the egg,” this is تفسير: and if [it be explained as meaning] “He produceth the believer from the unbeliever,” or “the knowing from the ignorant,” this is تاويل: so says Ibn-El-Kemál: (TA:) [hence, although it may often be rendered by &lt;i&gt;interpretation,&lt;/i&gt; like تفسير, it more properly signifies the &lt;i&gt;rendering in a manner not according to the letter,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;overt sense; explaining the covert,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;virtual,&lt;/i&gt; <br>\

                  ضُحَى [explained above]; and the سراب is that which is upon the surface of the ground, as though it were water, and is at midday: and this, I [namely Az] say, is what I have found the Arabs in the desert to say: (T:) El- Hareeree speaks of the glistening of the ا=ل; app. using this word in the sense of سراب; for it is the latter that glistens; not the former: (Har p. 363:) the word is masc. and fem.

Edh-Dhubyánee, (TA,) or El-Jaadee, (S,) [variously cited in the S and M and TA,] is an instance of inversion; the meaning being يَرْفَعُهُ اْلْا=لُ [&lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; <br>\

                  &lt;i&gt;raising it&lt;/i&gt;]: (S, TA:) or the meaning is, &lt;i&gt;making the&lt;/i&gt; <br>\

                  &lt;i&gt;conspicuous&lt;/i&gt; more than it would otherwise be; the agent of the verb being a prominent portion of a mountain, which, being itself raised [in appearance] by the ا=ل, has the effect of doing this.
