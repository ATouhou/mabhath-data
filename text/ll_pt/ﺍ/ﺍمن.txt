You say, يَاْمَنُهُ النَّاسُ وَلَا يَخَافُونَ غَايِلَتَهُ [&lt;i&gt;Men,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;people, trust,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;confide, in him, and do not fear his malevolence,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;mischievousness&lt;/i&gt;]. (T, M.) And اَمِنَهُ عَلَى كَذَا (S, Mgh, * Msb *) and ↓ <br>\

      يَاْتَمِنُهُ [&lt;i&gt;Men trust,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;confide, in him with respect to the times in which he calls to prayer&lt;/i&gt;], and know, by his calling to prayer, what they are commanded to do, as to praying and fasting and breaking fast. (Mgh.) It is said in the Kur [xii. 11], مَا لَكَ <br>\
                  لَا تَاْمَنُنَا عَلَى يُوسُفَ and [تَاْمَنَّا] with idghám [i. e. &lt;i&gt;What aileth thee that thou dost not trust,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;confide, in us with respect to Joseph?&lt;/i&gt; or, &lt;i&gt;that thou dost not give us charge over Joseph?&lt;/i&gt;]; (S;) meaning, why dost thou fear us for him? (Bd;) some pronouncing the verb in a manner between those of the former and the latter modes of writing it; but Akh says that the latter is better: (S:) some read تِيمَنَّا. (Bd.) You say also, ↓ <br>\

                  فُلَانٌ [&lt;i&gt;Such a one was trusted,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;confided, in&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.;] when it begins a sentence, changing the second ء into و; in like manner as you change it into ى when the first is with kesr, as in اِيتَمَنَهُ; and into ا when the first is with fet-h, as in ا=مَنَ. (S.) The phrase اَمَانَةً ↓ <br>\
      اُوتُمِنَ, in a saying of Mohammad, if it be not correctly عَلَى اَمَانَةٍ, may be explained as implying the meaning of اُسْتُحْفِظَ اَمَانَةً [&lt;i&gt;He was asked to take care of a deposite;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;he was intrusted with it&lt;/i&gt;]. (Mgh.) [You also say, اَمِنَهُ بِكَذَا, meaning &lt;i&gt;He intrusted him with such a thing;&lt;/i&gt; as, for instance, money or other property: see two exs. in the Kur iii. 68.]       -A2-  اَمُنَ, (M, Mgh, K,) or اَمِنَ, (Msb,) inf. n. اَمَانَةٌ, (M, Mgh, Msb,) &lt;i&gt;He was,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;became, trusted in,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;confided in:&lt;/i&gt; (M, K:) or &lt;i&gt;he was,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;became, trusty, trustworthy, trustful, confidential,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;faithful:&lt;/i&gt; said of a man.

      امّنهُ, [inf. n. تَاْمِينٌ;] (M, TA;) meaning &lt;i&gt;He rendered him secure,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;safe;&lt;/i&gt; (Msb;) &lt;i&gt;he rendered him secure,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;free from fear;&lt;/i&gt; (S, M, TA;) &lt;i&gt;contr. of&lt;/i&gt; <br>\

And of God you say, ا=مَنَ عِبادَهُ مِنْ اَنْ يَظْلِمَهُمْ [&lt;i&gt;He hath rendered his servants secure from his wronging them&lt;/i&gt;]. (S.) And يُوْمِنُ عِبَادَهُ مِنْ عَذَابِهِ [&lt;i&gt;He rendereth his servants secure from his punishment&lt;/i&gt;]. (M.)

                  الاَمَان [i. e. &lt;i&gt;security&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;safety,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;protection&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;safeguard,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;the promise&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;assurance of security&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;safety,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;indemnity,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;quarter,&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;i&gt;to the captive.&lt;/i&gt; (Msb.) And ا=مَنَ فُلَانٌ الَعَدُوَّ [&lt;i&gt;Such a one granted security,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c., &lt;i&gt;to the enemy&lt;/i&gt;], inf. n. as above. (T.) It is said in the Kur ch. ix. [verse 12], accord. to one reading, لَا اـِيمَانَ لَهُمْ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;They have not the attribute of granting protection;&lt;/i&gt; meaning that when they grant protection, they do not fulfil their engagement to protect. (T.)       -A2-  اـِيمَانٌ also signifies The &lt;i&gt;believing&lt;/i&gt; [a thing, or in a thing, and particularly in God]; syn. تَصْدِيقٌ; (T, S, &amp;amp;c.;) by common consent of the lexicologists and other men of science: (T:) its primary meaning is the &lt;i&gt;becoming true to the trust with respect to which God has confided in one, by a firm believing with the heart; not by profession of belief with the tongue only, without the assent of the heart;&lt;/i&gt; for he who does not firmly believe with his heart is either a hypocrite or an ignorant person. (T, TA.) Its verb is intrans. and trans. (TA, from a Commentary on the Mutowwal.) You say, ا=مَنَ, meaning &lt;i&gt;He believed.&lt;/i&gt; (T.) And it is said to be trans. by itself, like صَدَّقَ; and by means of بِ, considered as meaning اِعْتِرَافٌ [or &lt;i&gt;acknowledgment&lt;/i&gt;]; and by means of لِ, considered as meaning اـِذْعَانٌ [or &lt;i&gt;submission&lt;/i&gt;]. (TA.) [Thus] you say, [ا=منهُ and] ا=من بِهِ, (inf. n. اـِيمَانٌ, T, K,) namely, a thing. (T, M.) And ا=من بِاللّٰهِ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;He believed in God.&lt;/i&gt; (T.) It seems to be meant by what is said in the Ksh [in ii. 2], that ا=من بِهِ [or ا=مَنَهُ] properly signifies ا=مَنَهُ التَّكْذِيبَ [&lt;i&gt;He rendered him secure from being charged with lying,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;falsehood&lt;/i&gt;]; and that the meaning &lt;i&gt;he believed him&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;in him,&lt;/i&gt; is tropical; but this is at variance with what its author says in the A; and Es-Saad says that this latter meaning is proper. (TA.)  &lt;pb n=&quot;101&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; The phrase in the Kur [ix. 61], وَيُوْمِنُ لِلْموْمِنِينَ, accord. to Th, means &lt;i&gt;And he believeth the believers; giveth credit to them.&lt;/i&gt; (M.) ―         -b2-  Sometimes it is employed to signify The &lt;i&gt;acknowledging with the tongue&lt;/i&gt; only; and hence, in the Kur [lxiii. 3], ذلِكَ باَنَّهُمْ ا=مَنُوا ثُمَّ كَفَرُوا <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;That is because they acknowledged with the tongue, then disacknowledged with the heart.&lt;/i&gt; (TA.) ―         -b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The &lt;i&gt;trusting,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;confiding,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;having trust&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;confidence.&lt;/i&gt; (M, K.) [You say, ا=من بِهِ, meaning &lt;i&gt;He trusted,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;confided, in him,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;it:&lt;/i&gt; for] the verb of ايمان in this sense is trans. by means of بِ without implication; as Bd says. (TA.) [And it is also trans. by itself: for] you say, مَا ا=مَنَ اَنْ يَجِدَ صَحَابَةً, meaning (tropical:)  &lt;i&gt;He trusted not that he would find companions;&lt;/i&gt; (M, * K, * TA;) said of one who has formed the intention of journeying: or the meaning is مَا كَادَ [i. e. &lt;i&gt;he hardly,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;scarcely, found&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.; or &lt;i&gt;he was not near to finding&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.]. (M, K.) See also اَمِنَهُ. ―         -b4-  Also The &lt;i&gt;manifesting humility&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;submission, and the accepting the Law,&lt;/i&gt; (Zj, T, * K,) &lt;i&gt;and that which the Prophet has said&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;done, and the firm believing thereof with the heart;&lt;/i&gt; (Zj, T, M;) without which firm belief, the manifesting of humility or submission, and the accepting that which the Prophet has said or done, is termed اـِسْلَامٌ, for which one&#39;s blood is to be spared. (T.) [In this sense, it is trans. by means of لِ, accord. to some, as shown above; or by means of بِ, for, accord. to Fei,] you say, ا=مَنْتُ بِاللّٰهِ, inf. n. as above, meaning &lt;i&gt;I submitted,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;resigned, myself to God.&lt;/i&gt; (Msb.)

Th,] that ا=مِينَ is like عَاصِينَ, by which he was falsely supposed to mean its having the form of a pl., [and being consequently ا=مِّينَ,] (Msb, [and part of this is said in the M,]) whereas he thereby only meant that the م is without teshdeed, like the ص in عَاصِينَ; (M;) beside that the sense of قَاصِدِينَ [which is that of ا=مِّينَ, from اَمَّ,] would be inconsistent after the last phrase of the first chapter of the Kur [where ا=مينَ is usually added]; (Msb;) and sometimes it is pronounced with imáleh, [i. e. “émeena,”] as is said by ElWáhidee in the Beseet; (K;) but this is unknown in works on lexicology, and is said to be a mispronunciation of some of the Arabs of the desert of El-Yemen: (MF:) each form is indecl., (S,) with fet-h for its termination, like اَيْنَ and كَيْفَ, to prevent the occurrence of two quiescent letters together: (T, S, TA:) it is a word used immediately after a prayer, or supplication: (S, * M:) [it is best expressed, when occurring in a translation, by the familiar Hebrew equivalent &lt;i&gt;Amen:&lt;/i&gt;] El-Fárisee says that it is a compound of a verb and a noun; (M;) meaning &lt;i&gt;answer Thou me;&lt;/i&gt; [i. e. &lt;i&gt;answer Thou my prayer;&lt;/i&gt;] (M, Mgh;*) or &lt;i&gt;O God, answer Thou:&lt;/i&gt; (Zj, T, Msb, K:) or &lt;i&gt;so be it:&lt;/i&gt; (AHát, S, Msb, K:) or &lt;i&gt;so do Thou,&lt;/i&gt; (K, TA,) &lt;i&gt;O Lord:&lt;/i&gt; (TA:) it is strangely asserted by some of the learned, that, after the Fátihah, [or Opening Chapter of the Kur-án,] it is a prayer which implies all that is prayed for in detail in the Fátihah: so in the Towsheeh: (MF:) or it is &lt;i&gt;one of the names of God:&lt;/i&gt; (M, Msb, K:) so says El-Hasan (M, Msb) El-Basree: (Msb:) but the assertion that it is for يَا اَللّٰهُ [&lt;i&gt;O God&lt;/i&gt;], and that اسْتَجِبٌ [&lt;i&gt;answer Thou&lt;/i&gt;] is meant to be understood, is not correct accord. to the lexicologists; for, were it so, it would be with refa, not nasb.
