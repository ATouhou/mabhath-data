                  &lt;/form&gt; a vocative particle, (S, M, K,) used in calling him who is near and him who is distant: [in the former case, like &lt;i&gt;O:&lt;/i&gt; in the latter, like &lt;i&gt;ho there,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;soho,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;holla:&lt;/i&gt;] you say, اَيَا زَيْدُ اَقْبِلْ [&lt;i&gt;O Zeyd, advance:&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;ho there,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;soho,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;holla,&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp;c.]: (S:) or J is in error in saying this: it is used in calling to him who is distant: (Mughnee, K:) so say Ibn-El-Hájib, in the Káfiyeh, and ElFakhr El-Járabardee; and the latter adds, or to him who is in a predicament like that of him who is distant, being sleeping or inadvertent; the person who calls thereby being eager for the person called to advance to him: (TA:) or not used in calling to him who is near: (K:) and ه is substituted for its hemzeh; (M, K;) so that one says, هَيَا. (M.) AZ says, I have heard them say, اَيَا اـِيَاهُ اَقْبِلْ. (T in بَابُ الاَلِفَاتِ.) [Accord. to the TA, (art. ا,) one says also ا=يَا.]    &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\

(S.) Ibn-Keysán says, (S, M,) some of the grammarians say that اـِيَّاكَ, altogether, is a noun; and he adds, but some say (M) that the ك and ه &amp;amp;c. are the nouns, and that ايّا is a support thereto, because they cannot stand by themselves, (S, M,) like the ك &amp;amp;c. which occupy the latter place in يَضْرِبُكَ &amp;amp;c.; so when the ك &amp;amp;c. are put first, [as in اـِيَّاكَ ضَرَبْتُ <br>\
                  &lt;i&gt;Thee I beat,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;struck,&lt;/i&gt;] they are supported by ايا, and the whole becomes as one thing: (S:) and you may also say, ضَرَبْتُ اـِيَّاىَ [&lt;i&gt;I beat,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;struck, me&lt;/i&gt;]; because it is not allowable to say, ضَرَبْتُنِى: (S as corrected by IB:) but you may not say, ضَرَبْتُ اـِيَّاكَ [&lt;i&gt;I beat,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;struck, thee&lt;/i&gt;]; because you only require ايّاك when you cannot use the ك [alone]; though you may say, ضَرَبْتُكَ اـِيّاكَ [&lt;i&gt;I beat,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;struck, thee, thee&lt;/i&gt;]; because the ك is made to be syntactically dependent upon the verb, so when you repeat it you require ايّا. (S.) In the saying of the poet, (S,) Dhu-l-Isba&#39; El-&#39;Adwánee, (TA,) &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        كَاَنَّايَوْمَ قُرَّى اـِنَّمَا نَقْتُلُ اـِيَّانَا<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;As though we, on the day of Kurrà, only killed ourselves&lt;/i&gt;], he has separated it from the verb only because the Arabs do not make the action of the agent to fall upon the agent itself by the adjunction of the pronoun: they do not say, قَتَلْتُنِى, but only قَتَلْتُ نَفْسِى: so the poet has used ايّانا in the same manner as اَنْفُسَنَا. (S, TA.) Some of the grammarians say that اـِيَّا is prefixed to what follows it, governing it in the gen. case; and adduce as an evidence thereof a saying which see below, commencing with اـِذَا بَلَغَ الرَّجُلُ. (S.) &lt;pb n=&quot;136&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; Zj says that it is an explicit noun, [not a pronoun,] which is prefixed to all the pronouns, governing them in the gen. case; but only to pronouns; so that if one said, اـِيَّا زَيْدٍ حَدَّثْتُ, it would be bad. (M.) Kh holds that it is a pronoun prefixed to the ك [&amp;amp;c.], governing it in the gen. case; (M, K;) and the like is related to have been the opinion of El-Mázinee: and Sb relates of Kh that he said, if any one were to say اـِيَّاكَ <br>\
                  نَفْسَكَ [&lt;i&gt;Thee, thyself&lt;/i&gt;], I would not severely blame him, for this ك is [virtually] governed in the gen. case. (M.) But accord. to Akh, it is a simple, or uncompounded, pronoun, the ending of which becomes altered, as the endings of pronouns are wont to become, because of the varying of the numbers of the persons using them; (M, K; [in both of which the last of the word thus rendered is المضمرين; accord. to a copy of the M, المضمرين, i. e. المُضْمِرينَ; in a copy of the K, without any syll. signs; and in the CK, المُضْمَرَيْنِ; of which readings, I have followed that found in the M; supposing the meaning to be, that ايّا has different endings according as it is used by one speaking to another, or by one speaking of another, or by one speaking of himself, or to, or of, two or more, and the like;]) and the ك of ايَّاك is like the ك of ذٰلِكَ, inasmuch as it is an indication of allocution only, divested of the idea of its being a sign of the pronoun. (M.) Of all these varying opinions, IJ says that he has found none to be correct when investigated, except that of Akh; with whose opinion, that stated in the begining of this art. is identical [except as to the affix, which is there said to be a pronoun, not merely a particle of allocution]. (M, TA.) Zj, being asked to explain the meaning of the phrase اـِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ, [in the Kur i. 4,] answered, حَقِيتَتَكَ نَعْبُدُ [&lt;i&gt;Thine essence we worship&lt;/i&gt;]; and said that it is derived from ا=يَةٌ, meaning “a sign by which a thing is known:” but IJ does not approve of this. (M.) [Respecting the phrase, فَاـِذَا هُوَ اـِيَّاهَا, in which ايّاها is used in the place of a noun in the nom. case, and which is therefore disallowed by Sb, see اـِذَا.] ―         -b2-  It is also used for the purpose of cautioning, or putting one on his guard. (T, S.) You say, اـِيَّاكَ وَالاَسَدَ [&lt;i&gt;Beware thou of,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;avoid thou,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;remove thyself far from, the lion&lt;/i&gt;]: it is a substitute for a verb; as thou you said, بَاعِدْ: and you say also, هِيَّاكَ; like as you say اَرَاقَ and هَرَاقَ: (S:) [or ايّاك in this case is governed by a verb understood: for] Ibn-Keysán says, when you say, اـِيَّاكَ وَزَيْدًا [&lt;i&gt;Beware thou of,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;avoid thou,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;remove thyself far from, Zeyd&lt;/i&gt;], you caution him whom you address against Zeyd, and the verb governing the accus. case is not apparent: the meaning is, اُحَذِّرُكَ زَيْدًا [&lt;i&gt;I caution thee against Zeyd&lt;/i&gt;]; as though you said, اُحَذِّرُكَ اـِيَّاكَ وَزَيْدًا [&lt;i&gt;I caution thee, thee with Zeyd&lt;/i&gt;]; or as though you said, بَاعِدْ نَفْسَكَ عَنْ زَيْدٍ وَبَاعِد زَيْدًا عَنْكَ [&lt;i&gt;Remove thyself far from Zeyd, and remove Zeyd far from thee&lt;/i&gt;]; so that the verb governs the word signifying the person cautioned and that signifying him against whom that person is cautioned: (TA:) [and Az says,] when you say, اـِيَّاكَ وَرُكُوبَ الفَاحِشَةِ, the verb is suppressed: it is as though you said, اُحَذِّرُكَ رُكُوبَ الفَاحِشَةِ [&lt;i&gt;I caution thee against the committing of that which exceeds the bounds of rectitude&lt;/i&gt;]. (T.) Kh is related to have heard an Arab of the desert say, (T, * M, the latter on the authority of Sb.,) اـِذَابَلَغَ الرَّجُلُ السِّتِّينَ فَاـيَّاهُ وَاـِيَّا <br>\
                  الشَّوابّ [&lt;i&gt;When the man attains to sixty years, I caution him against,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;let him avoid, the young women&lt;/i&gt;]; (T, S, M;) prefixing ايّا to الشوابّ, and putting the latter in the gen. case: (S:) but accord. to Akh, it is not allowable to say [thus, or] اـِيَّاكَ وَاـِيَّا زَيْدٍ. (M.) Sometimes the و is suppressed, as in the saying of the poet, &lt;quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        فَاـِيَّاكَ اـِيَّاكَ المِرَا=ءَ فَاـِنَّهُ<br>\
                     &lt;L&gt;<br>\
                        اـِلَى الشَّرِّ دَعَّا=ءٌ وَلِلشَّرِّ جَالِبُ<br>\
                  &lt;/quote&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Then avoid thou, avoid thou obstinate disputation, for it is wont to invite to evil, and an attracter of evil&lt;/i&gt;]; meaning, اـِيَّاكَ وَالمِرَا=ءَ: i. e., اـِيَّاكَ وَاَنْ تُمَارِيَ. (TA.) You say [properly], اـِيَّاكَ وَاَنْ <br>\
                  تَفْعَلَ كَذَا [&lt;i&gt;Beware thou of,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;avoid thou, doing such a thing&lt;/i&gt;]: but [in strict propriety] you should not say, اـِيَّاكَ اَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا, without و. (S.) See also art. اي.    &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\
