                  , (S, K, * &amp;amp;c,) [originally كَوِدَ,] first pers. كِدْتُ, accord. to the usage of most of the Arabs, (IKtt,) aor. يَكَادُ, (S, K, &amp;amp;c.,) the form used by all the Arabs, (IKtt.) or يَكُودُ [is also used, by some of those who make the pret. to be originally كَوُدَ], (Lth,) inf. n. كَوْدٌ (Lth, S, M, K, &amp;amp;c) and كَادٌ (M, IKtt) and مَكَادَةٌ (Lth, S, M, K, &amp;amp;c.) and مَكَادٌ; (Lth, M, K;) and كَادَ, originally كَوُدَ, deviating from constant rule, (MF,) first pers. كُدْتُ, (S, IKtt, MF,) in the dial. of the Benoo-&#39;Adee, (MF,) mentioned by Sb as heard from some of the Arabs, (S,) aor. يَكَادُ, (IKtt,) deviating from constant rule, (MF,) [and يَكُودُ, mentioned above, agreeably with rule;] as also كَادَ, (Msb, K, art. كيد,) originally كَيِدَ, first pers. كِدْتُ, aor. يَكَادُ, (Msb, art. كيد,) inf. n. كَيْدٌ; (L, art. كيد;) and كِيدَ, (S, K, &amp;amp;c.,) a form mentioned by Abu-l-Khattáb to Sb, as used by some of the Arabs, who in like manner said مَا زِيلَ يَفْعَلُ <br>\
                  كَذَا, for كَادَ and زَالَ; (S;) <i>He was near to doing so; he nearly, well nigh,</i> or <i>almost, did so; he wanted but little of doing so;</i> (Akh, S, M, K, &amp;amp;c.;) <i>he purposed,</i> or <i>intended, doing so;</i> (Lth, M, IKtt;) <i>but did it not,</i> [or <i>did it not immediately</i>]. (Akh, S, K, &amp;amp;c.) كَادَ is applied to signify the being near to doing a thing whether it be [afterwards] done or not done. (S.) Without a negative, it enunciates the negation of the action; and coupled with a negative, it enunciates the happening of the action. (S, K.) [This will be explained in the course of the following observations.] It is (as Es-Suyootee says in the Itkán) an incomplete [i. e. a non-attributive] verb, of which only the pret. and aor. are used. It has a noun as the subject, in the nom. case; and an aor., [generally] without اَنْ, as the predicate. (TA.) Sometimes they introduce اَنْ after it, likening it to عَسَى; as, for ex., in the saying of Ru-beh, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        قَدْ كَادَ مِنْ طُولِ البِلَى اَنْ يَمْصَحَا<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>It had nearly come to nought from length of wear</i>]. (S.) Used affirmatively, it is affirmative of the being near [to doing a thing, &amp;amp;c.]; and used negatively, it is negative thereof. It is a well-known opinion of many, that, used affirmatively, it is negative; and used negatively, it is affirmative: so that كَادَ زَيْدٌ يَفْعَلُ means [<i>Zeyd was near to doing; but</i>] <i>he did not</i> [or <i>did not immediately</i>]; as is shown by the expression [in the Kur xvii. 75, where اـِنْ is a contraction of اـِنَّ,] وَاـِنْ كَادُوا لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ [<i>And verily they were near to seducing thee</i>]: and مَا كَادَ يَفْعَلُ means [<i>He was not near to doing; but</i>] <i>he did;</i> as is shown by the expression [in the Kur ii. 66,] وَمَا كَادُوا يَفْعَلُونَ [<i>And they were not near to doing</i> (<i>it</i>); <i>but they afterwards did</i> (<i>it</i>)]. I&#39;Ab is related to have said, that wherever كَادَ and اَكَادُ and يَكَادُ occur in the Kur-án, they denote a thing&#39;s never happening. Some say, that كَادَ [with a negative] denotes an action&#39;s happening with difficulty. Some, again, say, that the pret. preceded by a negative is affirmative [of the action &amp;amp;c.]; as is shown by the expression وَمَا كَادُوا يَفْعَلُونَ [quoted above]: and that the aor. preceded by a negative is negative; as is shown by the expression [in the Kur xxiv, 40,] لَمْ يَكَدْ يَرَاهَا [<i>He is not near to seeing it</i>]; meaning that he sees not anything: [though this phrase is said to bear a different meaning, which see below]. But the correct opinion is the one first mentioned; that, used affirmatively, it is affirmative [of the being near to do a thing &amp;amp;c.]; and used negatively, it is negative [thereof]: so that كَادَ يَفْعَلُ signifies <i>He was near to doing; but did not</i> [or <i>did not immediately</i>]: and مَا كَادَ يَفْعَلُ <br>\
                  <i>He was not near to doing; much less did he do</i> [or <i>do immediately</i>]; the denial of the action [or of the immediate performance of the action] being necessarily understood from the denial of the being near to do it. As to the expression in the Kur, وَمَا كَادُوا يَفْعَلُونَ [quoted above], it enunciates the state of the people to whom it relates in the beginning of their case; for they were far from sacrificing the cow; and the affirmation of the action is understood only from the [preceding] expression فَذَبَحُوهَا. And as to the expression [in the Kur xvii. 76,] لَقَدْ كِدتَّ تَرْكَنُ اـِلَيْهِمْ [<i>Thou hadst certainly been near to inclining to them</i>], the Prophet&#39;s not inclining to them little or much is understood from لَوْلَا [preceding], which requires this inference. (TA.) [Often, however, or (as some say) generally, with a negative preceding or following it, it is affirmative of the action&#39;s happening, but only after difficulty, or delay.] Aboo-Bekr says, that مَا كَادَ فُلَانٌ يَقُومُ means [<i>Such a one hardly,</i> or <i>scarcely,</i> or <i>tardily, rose;</i> like لَمْ يَكَدْ يَقُومُ, and كَادَ لَا يَقُومُ; وَقَدْ قَامَ being understood; or] <i>he rose after being slow,</i> or <i>tardy:</i> (L:) and accord. to Az and others, مَا كِدْتُ اَفْعَلُ means [<i>I hardly,</i> or <i>scarcely,</i> or <i>tardily, did;</i> or] <i>I did after being slow,</i> or <i>tardy:</i> but sometimes it means <i>I was not near to doing.</i> (Msb, art. كيد.) It is said, that كَادَ is sometimes a [mere redundant] connective (صِلَة) of the members of a sentence; (Kutr, Akh, AHát, K;) as in لَمْ يَكَدْ يَرَاهَا [quoted above], meaning, <i>He does not see it:</i> (K:) or this means <i>he is not near to seeing it:</i> or, as some say, <i>he sees it after his having been not near to seeing it</i> by reason of the intenseness of the darkness: [or <i>he hardly,</i> or <i>scarcely,</i> or <i>tardily, sees it:</i>] and Fr says, with reference to the verse in which this phrase occurs, that it is allowable to say لَمْ يَكَدْ يَقُومُ [meaning, <i>He hardly,</i> or <i>scarcely,</i> or <i>tardily, rose</i>] when one has risen after difficulty. (TA.) [Thus it appears, that, مَا كَادَ يَفْعَلُ and لَمْ يَكَدْ يَفْعَلُ sometimes signify <i>He hardly,</i> or <i>scarcely,</i> or <i>tardily, did:</i> and sometimes, <i>he was not near to doing; he never did; he did not at all:</i> so that it may be rendered <i>he hardly</i> or <i>scarcely,</i> or <i>nowise</i> or <i>in nowise</i> or <i>never, did:</i> or <i>he could hardly do,</i> or <i>he could not at all,</i> or <i>could not nearly,</i> or <i>he could nowise</i> or <i>in nowise, do.</i>] ―         -b2-  As asserts his having heard certain of the Arabs say, لَا اَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ وَلَا كَوْدًا [<i>I will not do that, nor will I be near to doing it</i>]. (S.) ―         -b3-  كَادَ also signifies <i>He desired;</i> syn. اَرَادَ. (Akh, S, K.) So in the verse <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        كَادَتْ وَكِدْتُ وَتِلْكَ خَيْرُ اـِرَادَةٍ<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        لَوْ عَادَ مِنْ لَهْوِ الصَّبَابَةِ مَا مَضَى<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>She desired, and I desired; and that were the best of desire, if what hath passed, of the diverting delight of tender love, returned</i>]. (Akh, S.) So, too, in the saying in the Kur [xx. 15,] اَكَادُ اُخْفِيهَا <br>\
                  <i>I desire</i> (S, K) <i>to conceal it:</i> or, <i>to manifest it:</i> (Beyd:) for, like as it is allowable to put اُرِيدُ in the place of اَكَادُ, as in the saying in the Kur [xviii. 76,] جِدَارًا يُرِيدُ <br>\
                  اَنْ يَنْقَضَّ, so it is to use اكاد [in the place of اريد]: Akh says, that the words of the verse in question mean <i>I will conceal it,</i> <br>\
                  اُخْفِيهَا: and some say, that the meaning is <i>I will manifest it:</i> (TA:) but most hold, that اكاد should here be rendered in its original sense. (MF, TA.) Some of the Arabs make كاد to denote certainty; like ظَنَّ, which primarily denotes doubt, and secondarily certainty. (L, art. كيد.) ―         -b4-  عَرَفَ مَا يُكَادُ مِنْهُ [is in like manner explained] <i>He hath become acquainted with that which is desired of him.</i> (S, K.) ―         -b5-  You say to him who seeks of you a thing, when you do not desire to give him it, لَا وَلَا مَكَادَةَ وَلَا مَهَمَّةَ, (Lth, S, * L, K, *) and لَا كَوْدًا وَلَا هَمًّا, and لَا مَكَادًا وَلَا مَهَمًّا, (Lth, L,) i. e. لَا اَكَادُ وَلَا اَهُمُّ [<i>No, nor do I desire, nor do I purpose,</i> or <i>intend</i>]. (Lth, L, K.) ―         -b6-  You also say, in the same sense, لَا مَهَمَّةَ لِى وَلَا مَكَادَةَ [<i>I have no purpose</i> or <i>intention, nor any desire</i>]. (S) ―         -b7-  See also كَادَ in art. كيد.   </entryFree> <br>\
