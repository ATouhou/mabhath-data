                  , (ISk, S, A, Msb, K,) and كَاسٌ, with the ء suppressed, is allowable, (Msb,) and sometimes occurs, (TA,) <i>A drinking-cup:</i> (A, K:) or [<i>a cup of wine;</i> i. e.] <i>a cup containing wine;</i> (S, A, K;) or <i>a cup full of wine:</i> (Msb:) when not containing wine, it is not thus called; (IAar, S, Msb;) being in this case called قَدَحٌ: (TA:) or it has the first and the second of these significations: (TA:) or it signifies <i>wine itself:</i> (As, AHát, Ibn-&#39;Abbád:) or has this signification also: (K:) and is of the fem. gender: (S, A, Msb, K:) pl. [of pauc.] اَكْوُسٌ and [of mult.] كُوُوسٌ and كِيَاسٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the last with ء, (TA, [but written without ء in the CK,]) and, accord. to AHn, كِيَاسٌ, without ء, which, if correct, is originally كِوَاسٌ, from كَاسٌ, with the ء changed into ا as representing و, (TA,) and  <br>\
                  كَاسَاتٌ, (K,) without ء. (TA.) It is used metaphorically in relation to every kind of disagreeable, hateful, or evil, things. Thus you say, سَقَاهُ كَاْسًا مِنَ الذُّلِّ (tropical:)  [<i>He gave him to drink a cup of abasement</i>]: and مِنَ الفُرْقَةِ (tropical:)  [<i>of separation</i>]: and مِنَ المَوْتِ (tropical:)  [<i>of death</i>]: and مِنَ <br>\
                  الحُبِّ (tropical:)  [<i>of love</i>]. (TA.) You say also, سَقَاهُ <br>\
                  الكَاْسَ الاَمَرَّ (tropical:)  [<i>He gave him to drink the most bitter cup</i>]; meaning <i>death:</i> (A, TA:) and كُوُوسَ المَنَايَا (tropical:)  [<i>The cups of death;</i> lit., <i>deaths</i>]. (A.) Az. thinks that it may be derived from كَاصَ فُلَانٌ مِنَ الطَّعَامِ وَالشَّرَابِ, meaning, “ Such a one ate and drank much ”; because ص and س are interchangeable in many words on account of the nearness of their places of utterance.
