      كَالِبٌ signify <i>a pack,</i> or <i>collected number, of dogs:</i> (K:) [both are quasi-pl. ns. in my opinion, though the former is called a pl. in the S:] accord. to some, the former, if masc., is a quasipl. n. ; and if fem., a pl.: (MF:) the latter is like جَامِلٌ and بَاقِرٌ [which are both quasi-pl. ns.].

(A &#39;Obeyd.) If we read الكلابُ, the meaning is <i>The dogs are upon,</i> or <i>against, the wild oxen:</i> and in like manner, if we read الكرابُ, the meaning is “ The turning over of the soil is the work of the oxen: ” if الكرابَ, “ Leave the turning over of the soil to the oxen. ” (MF, from expositions of the Fs.) ―         -b5-  [كَلْبٌ <br>\

      كُلَابٌ (Lth) <i>Madness which affects a dog in consequence of eating human flesh.</i> (K.) ―         -b2-  Also, <i>Madness like that of dogs, which affects a man in consequence of his having been bitten by a</i> [<i>mad</i>] <i>dog:</i> (K:) [<i>a disorder</i>] <i>resembling madness,</i> or <i>diobolical possession:</i> (S:) <i>a disease that befalls a man from the bite of a mad dog, occasioning what resembles madness,</i> or <i>diabolical possession, so that whomsoever he bites, that person also becomes in like manner affected, abstaining from drinking water until he dies of thirst:</i> the Arabs concur in the assertion that its cure is a drop of the blood of a king, mixed with water, and given to the patient to drink. (TA.) Accord. to El-Mufaddal, it originates from a disease which befalls the standing corn &amp;amp;c., and which is not removed until the sun rises upon it: if cattle eat of it before that, they die: wherefore Mohammad forbade pasturing by night: but sometimes a camel runs away, and eats of such pasture before sunrise, and dies in consequence: then a dog comes, and eats of its flesh, and becomes mad; and if it bite a man, he also becomes mad, and when he hears the barking of a dog, answers it [by barking].

But some reject this explanation, and assert the meaning to be, that, when a man is enraged [by desire of obtaining revenge], and takes his blood revenge, the blood is the cure of his rage, though not really drunk.
