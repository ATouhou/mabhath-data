[The كساء was evidently a simple oblong piece of cloth; for الكِسَايِى is said to have been thus named because he wore a كساء while in the state of اـِحْرَام; as is mentioned in the TA, art. كسو; but it seems to have been sometimes sewed in the manner of the عَبَا=ء, which see; and see also مُسَيَّحٌ, and بُرْدٌ.] It is [properly] not one of the garments which are cut and sewed [but is a single piece]: (Mgh, art. قطع:) [<i>a wrapper,</i> or <i>wrapping garment, of a single piece</i>]. ―         -b3-  رَكِبَ كِسَا=ءَهُ <br>\
