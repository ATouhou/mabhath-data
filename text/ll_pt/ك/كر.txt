      كَرْكَرَهُ; (K; [in the CK, كَرْكَرَةً is put by mistake for كَرْكَرَهُ;]) either <i>by act</i> or <i>by speech:</i> (MF:) it differs from اَعَادَهُ, which signifies only “ he repeated it once; ” for none but the vulgar say اَعَادَهُ مَرَّاتٍ; whereas كَرَّرَهُ may signify [not only the same as اَعَادَهُ, as it does in many instances, but also] <i>he repeated it time after time:</i> (Aboo-Hilál El-&#39;Askeree:) some explain كَرَّرَهُ as signifying <i>he mentioned it twice,</i> and <i>he mentioned it one time after another:</i> (Sadr-ed-Deen Zádeh:) when it is used in the former of these two senses, the term تَكْرَارٌ applies to the second, and to the first [with respect to the second]: (&#39;Ináyeh, in the early part of chap. ii.; and TA:) but its explanation as signifying the mentioning a thing one time after another is a conventional rendering of the rhetoricians: (MF:) Es-Suyootee says, that تَكْرَارٌ signifies the <i>renewing the first word</i> or <i>phrase;</i> and it denotes a sort of تَاْكِيد [or corroboration]: but it is said to be a condition of تاكيد that the words or phrases [which are repeated] be without interruption, and occur not more than three times; and that تكرار differs from it in both these particulars; so that the phrase in the Kur, [chap. lv.,] فَبِاَىِّ ا=لَا=ءِ رَبِّكُمَا <br>\
                  تُكَذِّبَانِ is an instance of تكرار, not of تاكيد, because it occurs [with interruptions and] more than three times; and so another phrase in the Kur, [chap. lxxvii.,] وَيْلٌ يَوْمَيِذٍ لِلْمُكَذِّبِينَ.
