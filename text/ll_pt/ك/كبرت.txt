                   [<i>Brimstone,</i> or <i>sulphur;</i>] a thing well known; (S, art. كبر;) <i>one of the kinds of stone with which fire is kindled,</i> or it (red كبريت TA) is <i>a mineral whereof the mine is beyond EtTubbat,</i> [<i>or the country of Et-Tibbet, in Tartary,</i>] <i>in the Valley of the Ants,</i> (K,) <i>by which Solomon passed,</i> (TA,) [as related in the Kur, xxvii. 18]: or [the <i>product of</i>] <i>a spring,</i> or <i>source, whereof the water, when it congeals, becomes white, and yellow, and dusky-coloured,</i> <br>\
                  كبريت: (Lth, in the T:) <i>MF says, I have seen it in several places; among these, in one which is near El-Maláleeh, between Fás and Miknáseh; by swimming in which, persons are cured of the venereal disease, and other disorders: also in Africa Proper, in the midst of Barkah, in a place called</i> <br>\
                  البرج; <i>and in other places:</i> (TA:) <i>Aristotle says, that, among the different kinds of</i> <br>\

                  <i>are the red, of an excellent colour; and the white, which resembles dust; and the yellow: the source of the red is in the West: it does not appear in its place: the yellow is found near the ocean, a league</i> (or <i>leagues,</i> as in the TA,) <i>from it: it is useful in cases of epilepsy, and apoplexy, and megrim, and palpitation: and it enters into the preparations of gold: the white blackens white substances; and it is sometimes mixed and concealed in the sources of running water, which sources have a fetid odour: the person who plunges into these waters in times when the air is temperate is cured by them of wounds, and swellings, and scab, and wind in the womb, and</i> [<i>the leprosy called</i>] سَلَع, <i>that arises from black bile: Ibn-Seenà</i> [Avicenna] <i>also says, that</i> <br>\
                  كبريت, <i>untouched by fire, is one of the remedies for the leprosy</i> (بَرَص): <i>that, mixed with the gum of the turpentine-tree, it removes marks on the nails: that, mixed with vinegar, it removes the</i> [<i>leprous-like discolouration of the skin called</i>] بَهَق, <i>and the ringworm,</i> or <i>tetter,</i> (قُوَبَاء,) <i>especially with the gum of the turpentine-tree: that, with natron and water, it is an embrocation for the</i> <br>\
                  بَرَص [or, as in the TA, <i>for the</i> <br>\
                  نِقْرِس, or <i>gout</i>): <i>and that fumigation therewith stops a rheum: and others say, that, if yellow</i> <br>\

                  <i>causes all the fruits of it to fall.</i> (El-Kazweenee.) Several authors say, that the ت in كبريت is an augmentative letter, and that the proper place of the word is in art. كبر. IDrd thinks it to be not genuine Arabic. (TA.) [Golius thinks it to be from the Persian كُوكُرْدْ (or كُوكُرْدْ): or rather, he adds, from the Hebrew        <br>\

                  اَعَزُّمِنَ الكِبْرِيتِ الاَحْمَرِ [<i>More rare than red brimstone,</i> or <i>sulphur</i>]. A proverb. Some say, that كبريت احمر [meaning as above] is a thing that does not exist: others, that by it is meant gold. (Meyd.) This phrase is similar to اَعَزُّ <br>\
                  مِنْ بَيْضِ الاَنُوقِ. (S, art. كبر.) ―         -b3-  كِبْرِيتٌ also signifies <i>gold:</i> (K:) [see above:] or <i>red gold:</i> or <i>red</i> [as an epithet applied to gold]: (TA:) or <i>pure,</i> as an epithet applied to gold. (S, art. كبر.) Ru-beh says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        هَلْ يَنْفَعَنِّى كَذِبٌ سِخْتِيتُ<br>\

                        اَوْ فِضَّةٌ اَوْ ذَهَبٌ كِبْرِيتُ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>Will vehement lying profit me,</i> or <i>silver,</i> or <i>pure gold?</i>] (S, art. كبر.) IAar says, Ru-beh imagined that كبريت meant gold: upon which MF observes, that the ancient Arabs erred with respect to meanings, though not with respect to words. The latter author, however, supposes كبريت to be fig. used as signifying gold; for they use the expression الكبريت الاحمر [as applied to gold] because gold is [said to be] prepared therefrom, and it is used in alchymical processes. (TA.) ―         -b4-  كِبْرِيتٌ also signifies The <i>red jacinth,</i> or <i>ruby;</i> syn. يَاقُوتٌ اَحْمَرُ. (K.)   </entryFree> <br>\
