                  , (S, K, &amp;amp;c.;) [respecting which Fei observes,] ElFárábee, whom J follows, says that it is like يَضْرِبُ, but in a trustworthy copy of the T it is written      <br>\
                     كَفُرَ<br>\
                  , and this is the proper form, because they say that كَفَرَ النِّعْمَةَ [of which the aor. is      <br>\
                     كَفُرَ<br>\
                  ] is borrowed from كَفَرَ الشَّىْءَ in the sense which is first explained below; (Msb;) and MF says, that the saying of J, following his maternal uncle Aboo-Nasr El-Fárábee, that the aor. of this verb is      <br>\
                     كَفِرَ<br>\
                  , is doubtless a mistake; but to this, [says SM,] I reply, that it is correctly      <br>\
                     كَفِرَ<br>\
                  , as J and F and other leading lexicologists have said; though the aor. of the verb of كُفْرٌ as meaning the contr. of اـِيْمَانٌ is      <br>\
                     كَفُرَ<br>\
                  ; (TA;) [or, if this latter verb be taken from the former, the aor. of the former may have been originally      <br>\
                     كَفِرَ<br>\
                   and      <br>\
                     كَفُرَ<br>\
                  , and general usage may have afterwards applied the aor.      <br>\

[and inf. n.] as above, <i>he covered it; covered it over.</i> (K,) You say كَفَرَ البَذْرَ اْلْمَبْذُورَ <br>\
                  <i>He covered the sown seed</i> with earth. (TA.) And كَفَرَ <br>\

                  <i>He put his goods in a receptacle.</i> (TA.) And كَفَرَ اْلْمَتَاعَ فِى الوِعَا=ءِ <br>\
                  <i>He covered,</i> or <i>concealed, the goods in the receptacle.</i> (A.) And ↓ <br>\
      كَفَّرَ <br>\

                  <i>He covered himself with the arms.</i> (A.) And كَفَرَ الجَهْلُ عَلَى عِلْمِ فُلَانٍ <br>\
                  <i>Ignorance covered over the knowledge of such a one.</i> (TA.) وَكَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ, [thus, with damm as the vowel of the aor.,] in the Kur, iii. 96, has been explained as signifying <i>And wherefore do ye cover the familiarity and love in which ye were living?</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  Hence, (Msb, TA,) كَفَرَ, (S,) and كَفَرَ النِّعْمَةَ, and بِالنِّعْمَةِ; (Msb;) and كَفَرَ <br>\
                  نِعْمَةَ اْللّٰهِ, and بِنِعْمَةِ اْللّٰهِ; (K;) aor.      <br>\
                     كَفُرَ<br>\
                  , (TA,) inf. n. كُفْرَانٌ. (S, K,) which is the most common form in this case, (El-Basáïr,) and كُفُورٌ, (S, K,) and كُفْرٌ; (El-Basáïr;) <i>He covered,</i> or <i>concealed,</i> (Msb,) <i>and denied,</i> or <i>disacknowledged, the favour</i> or <i>benefit</i> [<i>conferred upon him</i>]; (S, Msb;) <i>he was ungrateful,</i> or <i>unthankful,</i> or <i>behaved ungratefully</i> or <i>unthankfully; contr. of</i> <br>\
                  شَكَرَ; (S;) and <i>he denied,</i> or <i>disacknowledged, and concealed,</i> or <i>covered, the favour</i> or <i>benefit of God:</i> (K:) God&#39;s favours or benefits are the signs which show to those who have discrimination that their Creator is one, without partner, and that He has sent apostles with miraculous signs and revealed scriptures and manifest proofs. (Az, TA.) وَلَا نَكْفُرُكَ, in the prayer [termed القُنُوتُ], means وَلَا نَكْفُرُ نِعْمَتَكَ [<i>And we will not deny,</i> or <i>disacknowledge, thy favour;</i> or <i>we will not be ungrateful,</i> or <i>unthankful, for it</i>]. (Msb.) [The verb when used in this sense, seems, from what has been said above, to be a حَقِيقَة عُرْفِيَّة, or word so much used in a particular tropical sense as to be, in that sense, conventionally regarded as proper.] ―         -b3-  And hence, كَفَرَ, inf. n. كُفْرَانٌ, is used to signify [absolutely] <i>He denied,</i> or <i>disacknowledged.</i> (TA.) [See the act. part. n., below: and see 3. See also art. ف, p. 2322 <i>a.</i>] You say كَفَرَ بِالصَّانِعِ <br>\
                  <i>He denied the Creator.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b4-  Hence also, (TA.) كَفَرَ, (S, Msb,) aor.      <br>\
                     كَفُرَ<br>\
                  , (Msb, TA,) inf. n. كُفُرٌ, (S, Msb, K,) which is the most common form in this case, (El-Basáïr,) and كَفْرٌ (K) and كُفْرَانٌ (Msb, K) and كُفُورٌ, (K,) <i>He disbelieved; he became an unbeliever,</i> or <i>infidel; contr. of</i> <br>\
                  ا=مَنَ, inf. n. اـِيْمَانٌ. (S, K.) You say كَفَرَ بِاْللّٰهِ (S, Msb) <i>He disbelieved in God:</i> (S:) because he who does so conceals, or covers, the truth, and the favours of the liberal Dispenser of favours [who is God]. (MF.) [Also, as shown above, <i>He denied God.</i>] It is related in a trad. of &#39;Abd-El-Melik, that he wrote to El- Hajjáj, مَنْ اَقَرَّ بِالكُفْرِ فَخَلِّ سَبِيلَهُ, meaning, <i>Whosoever confesses the unbelief</i> of him who opposes the Benoo-Marwán, and goes forth against them, <i>let him go his way.</i> (TA.) See also كُفْرٌ, below. ―         -b5-  [<i>He blasphemed:</i> a signification very common in the present day.] ―         -b6-  Also, كَفَرَ بِكَذَا <br>\
                  <i>He declared himself to be clear,</i> or <i>quit, of such a thing.</i> (Msb.) In this sense it is used in the Kur xiv. 27. (Msb, TA.) ―         -b7-  And كَفَرَ also signifies <i>He was remiss,</i> or <i>fell short of his duty, with respect to the law, and neglected the gratitude</i> or <i>thankfulness to God which was incumbent on him.</i> So in the Kur xxx. 43; as is shown by its being opposed to عَمِلَ صَالِحًا.

                  , inf. n. تَكْفِيرٌ: see 1, first signification, in three places.       -A2-  Hence, كَفَّرَ الذَّنْبَ <br>\
                  <i>It</i> (war in the cause of God [or the like]) <i>covered,</i> or <i>concealed, the crime</i> or <i>sin:</i> (Mgh:) (or <i>expiated it:</i> or <i>annulled it;</i> for] تكفير with respect to acts of disobedience is like اـِحْبَاطٌ with respect to reward. (S, K.) The saying in the Kur [v. 70.] لَكَفَّرْنَا عَنْهُمْ سَيِّيَاتِهِمْ means, <i>We would cover,</i> or <i>conceal, their sins, so that they should become as though they had not been:</i> or it may mean, <i>We would do away with their sins;</i> as is indicated by another saying in the Kur [xi. 116,] “ good actions do away with sins. ” (El-Basáïr.) كَفَّرَ اْللّٰهُ عَنْهُ الذَّنْبَ signifies <i>God effaced his sin.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b2-  And كَفَّرَ عَنْ يَمِينِهِ [<i>He expiated his oath;</i>] <i>he performed,</i> (Msb,) or <i>gave,</i> (K,) <i>what is termed</i> <br>\
                  كَفَّارَة [i. e. <i>a fast,</i> or <i>alms, for the expiation of his oath</i>]: (Msb, K:) تَكْفِيرٌ of an oath is the doing what is incumbent, or obligatory, for the violation, or breaking, thereof: (S:) كَفَّرَ يَمِينَهُ is a vulgar phrase. (Mgh.)       -A3-  كَفَّرَهُ as syn. with اَكْفَرَهُ: see 4.       -A4-  كَفَّرَ لَهُ, inf. n. تَكْفِيرٌ, (A, Mgh, TA,) <i>He did</i> <br>\

                  رُكُوعٌ; <i>as one does when he desires to pay honour to his friend;</i> (TA;) or <i>as the</i> <br>\

                  رُكُوعٌ; the doing of which was disapproved by Mohammad, accord. to a trad. (TA.) It is said in a trad., اـِذَا اَصْبَحَ <br>\

                  <i>When the son of Adam rises in the morning, verily all the members abase themselves to the tongue,</i> (Mgh, TA,) <i>and confess obedience to it, and humbly submit to its command.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  تَكْفِيرٌ also signifies The <i>crowning</i> a king <i>with a crown,</i> [because] when he, or it, is seen, obeisance is done to him (اـِذَا رُيِىَ كُفِّرَ لَهُ).

                  <i>He denied,</i> or <i>disacknowledged, to me my right,</i> or <i>just claim.</i> (A, Mgh, K.) Hence the saying of &#39;Ámir, اـِذَا اَقَرَّ عِنْدَ القَاضِى <br>\

                  كَافَرَ being thus used in the sense of كَفَرَ]. But as to the saying of Mohammad [the lawyer], رجُلٌ لَهُ عَلَى ا=خَرَ دَيْنٌ فَكَافَرَهُ بِهِ سِنِينَ [<i>A man who owed to another a debt, and denied to him, in the case of it, for years</i>], he seems to have made it imply the meaning of المُمَاطَلَة, and therefore to have made it trans. in the same manner as المماطلة is trans.

Hence the saying of Mo&#39;áwiyeh, اَهْلُ الكُفُورِ هُمْ اَهْلُ القُبُورِ [<i>The people of the villages are the people of the graves</i>]; meaning, that they are as the dead; they do not see the great towns and the performance of the congregational prayers of Friday: (S, Mgh:) by الكفور he meant <i>the villages</i> (القُرَى) <i>remote from the great towns and from the places where the people of science assemble,</i> so that ignorance prevails among their inhabitants, and they are most quickly affected by innovations in religion and by natural desires which cause to err.
