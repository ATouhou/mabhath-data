      تكابر (K) <i>He magnified himself; behaved proudly, haughtily,</i> or <i>insolently;</i> (K;) syn. تَعَظَّمَ: (S:) or تكبّر signifies, as used in the Kur, vii. 143, <i>he considered himself as of the most excellent of the creation, and as having rights which others have not:</i> (Zj:) or this verb has two significations: one of them, <i>he did really good and great actions, exceeding the good actions of others;</i> and hence المُتَكَبِّرُ [applied to God] in the Kur, lix. 23: the other, <i>he affected to do such actions, and boasted of great qualities which he did not possess;</i> as do the generality of men; and hence, مُتَكَبِّر in the Kur, xl. 37; and the verb itself in the Kur, vii. 143: and ↓ <br>\
      استكبر is nearly syn. with تكبّر, and likewise has two significations: one of them, <i>he endeavoured, and sought, to become great;</i> and to do so, when the manner and place and time are such as are requisite, is praiseworthy: the other, <i>he boasted of qualities which he did possess, and feigned such qualities;</i> and to do so is blameable; and in this sense the verb is used in the Kur, ii. 32: (El-Basáïr:) and ↓ <br>\

(Msb.) ―         -b2-  اَكْبَرُ is also used in the sense of كَبِيرٌ: (Msb:) accord. to some, اَللّٰهُ اَكْبَر means <i>God is great;</i> (Az, Mgh, Msb;) like as هُوَ اَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ [in the Kur, xxx. 26,] means هُوَ هَيِّنٌ عَلَيْهِ; (Az, TA;) but this explanation is of weak authority: (Mgh:) accord. to others, the phrase is elliptical, and means <i>God is the greatest great</i> [<i>being</i>]: (Az, TA:) or <i>God is greater than every</i> [<i>other</i>] <i>great</i> [<i>being</i>]: (Msb:) or <i>greater than every</i> [<i>other</i>] <i>thing:</i> (Mgh, TA:) or <i>greater than such as that one knows the measure of His majesty:</i> (TA:) [or it may be rendered <i>God is most great,</i> meaning, greater than any other being:] it is considered as elliptical because it is necessary that اكبر should have the article ال, or be followed by a noun in the gen. case [or by the prep. مِنْ]. (TA.) In the phrase اَللّٰهُ اَكْبَرُ كَبِيراً, the word كبيرا is put in the accus. case [as a corroborative] in the place of the inf. n. تَكْبِيراً, as though one said اُكَبِّرُ تَكْبِيرًا [<i>I magnify</i> Him <i>greatly,</i> after saying اللّٰه اكبر]. (TA.) ―         -b3-  يَوْمُ الحَجِّ الاَكْبَرِ [<i>The day of the greater pilgrimage,</i>] means <i>the day of the sacrifice:</i> or, as some say, <i>the day of &#39;Arafeh:</i> and others say otherwise. (TA.) ―         -b4-  In the following words, in a trad. of Mázin, بُعِثَ نَبِىٌّ مِنْ مُضَرَ بِدِينِ اْللّٰهِ <br>\
                  الكُبَرِ, there is an ellipsis, and the meaning is, بِشَرَيِعِ دِينِ اْللّٰهِ الكُبَرِ [<i>A prophet of Mudar hath been sent with the greatest,</i> or <i>greater,</i> or <i>great, ordinances of God</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b5-  In a trad. respecting burial, وَيُجْعَلُ اْلْاَكْبَرُ مِمَّا يَلِى اْلْقِبْلَةَ means, <i>And the most excellent shall be placed towards the Kibleh:</i> or, if they be equal [in dignity], <i>the oldest.</i> (TA.) [Agreeably with the former rendering,] اَكْبَرُ, in the Kur, xxix. 44, is explained as signifying <i>Better.</i> (TA, art. ذكر.) [And agreeably with the second rendering of the above trad.,] you say هٰذَا اَكْبَرُ مِنْ زَيْدٍ, meaning, <i>This is older than Zeyd.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b6-  In a trad. of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr, the phrase دَعَا بِكُبْرِهِ means <i>He summoned his sheykhs,</i> and <i>elders,</i> or <i>great men:</i> <br>\
                  كُبْر being here [notwithstanding what has been said above,] pl. of اَكْبَرُ, like as حُمْرٌ is pl. of اَحْمَرُ. (TA.) ―         -b7-  هٰذِهِ الجَارِيَةُ مِنْ <br>\
