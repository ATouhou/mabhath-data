                  , inf. n. كَمْثَرَةٌ, <i>It became compact,</i> <br>\
                  <i>one part of it entering into another,</i> or <i>parts into parts:</i> (K: [but only the inf. n. is there mentioned:]) an obsolete verb: (TA:) whence the following word, (IDrd, K,) if it be Arabic. (IDrd.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>كُمَّثْرًى</b>               1     <br>\
                     كُمَّثْرًى<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                   (S, Msb, K,) a [coll.] gen. n., with tenween, and, accord. to some, كُمَثْرًى, without teshdeed, but others disallow this, (Msb,) <i>A certain kind of fruit;</i> (T, S;) <i>well known;</i> [namely, the <i>pear;</i>] called by [some of] the vulgar اـِجَّاصٌ: (T:) [it is called by this latter name, and also اـِنْجَاص and اـِنْجَاس, in Syria; but in Egypt and some other countries, كُمَّثْرَى:] n. un. كُمَّثْرَاةٌ: (S, Msb, K:) pl. كُمَّثْرَيَاتٌ: (K:) [here I find added in the TA, it is fem., imperfectly decl.; and in the K, “ and sometimes it is masc. ”: but this is evidently wrong: it is masc., and with tenween, as is shown by its n. un.; but it is sometimes made fem., and then it must be written كُمَّثْرَى, without tenween: for it is added,] and one says, هٰذِهِ كُمَّثْرَى وَاحِدَةٌ [<i>this is one pear:</i> in the copies of the K in my possession erroneously written كُمَّثْرًى]: and هٰذِهِ كُمَّثْرَى كَثِيرَةٌ [<i>these are many pears</i>]. (K.) Its dim. has the following forms: كُمَيْمِثْرَةٌ, (K,) which is the most agreeable with analogy, (ISd, TA,) and كُمَيْمِثْرِيَةٌ, (K,) which is the form adopted by those who make the pl. كمَّثْرَيَاتٌ, (ISk, TA,) and كُمَيْثِرَةٌ, (K,) which is the best form, (ISk, TA,) and كُمَيْمِثْرَاةٌ. (K.) Az says, I have asked a number of Arabs of the desert respecting the كمثرّى, but they knew it not. (TA.)   </entryFree> <br>\
