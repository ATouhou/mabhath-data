                  <i>A ram,</i> or <i>male sheep, whatever be his age:</i> (M, TA:) or <i>a male sheep</i> [<i>that has entered his third year,</i>] <i>when he has cast his central incisors:</i> or <i>when his tooth that is next to the central pair of incisors has come forth:</i> (Lth, K:) [also applied in the present day to the <i>wild sheep of the Arabian and Egyptian deserts and mountains; ovis tragelaphus:</i>] pl. [of pauc.] اَكْبُشٌ and اَكْبَاشٌ (K) and [of mult.] كِبَاشٌ (S, A, K) [and app. كُبُوشٌ] and كُبُوشَةٌ, like صُقُورَةٌ from صَقْرٌ. (TA.) The female is not called كَبْشَةٌ, but نَعْجَةٌ. (IJ. [See رَاجِلَةٌ.]) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  The <i>chief,</i> or <i>lord,</i> of a people, or company of men; (S, K;) their <i>leader:</i> (K:) or their <i>strenuous defender,</i> or <i>protector,</i> and the <i>one</i> of them <i>to whom others look.</i> (TA.) You say, هُوَ كَبْشُ الكَتِيبَةِ (A, TA) (tropical:)  <i>He is the leader of the army,</i> or <i>troop:</i> (TA:) and هُمْ كِبَاشُ <br>\
                  الكَتَايِبِ (tropical:)  [<i>They are the leaders of the armies,</i> or <i>troops</i>]. (A, TA.) And كِبَاشٌ also signifies  (tropical:)  <i>Heroes,</i> or <i>brave men.</i> (TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  <i>Aged and learned persons.</i> (TA in art. خرف.) ―         -b3-  [Hence also, (tropical:)  <i>A buttress:</i> and <i>a corbel which juts out from a wall to support a superstructure:</i> so in the present day: pl. كُبُوشٌ.] You say, بَنَوْا سُورًا حَصِينًا وَوَثَّقُوهُ بِالكُبُوشِ (tropical:)  [<i>They built a strong town-wall, and made it firm with the buttresses</i>].

                   [<i>A handful:</i> a <i>heap:</i> so applied in the the present day. ―         -b2-  And hence, (assumed tropical:)  <i>A gang,</i> or <i>crew:</i> thus, also, applied in the present day. Whence the sayings,] بَنُو فُلَانٍ كَبْشَةُ رُذَلَا=ءَ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>The sons of such a one are a gang of vile persons</i>]: and كَبْشَةُ دُنَسَا=ءَ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>a gang of dirty,</i> or <i>filthy, persons</i>]: thus they use this word to intimate dispraise: but [SM adds,] I know not how this is. (TA.) [Perhaps SM means that he doubts whether the word thus used be classical or not: for as to its signification, it is well known.]    </entryFree> <br>\
