(TA.) You say, رَاعَتِ الحِنْطَةُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor. تَرِيعُ, inf. n. رَيْعٌ [&amp;amp;c.]; (Msb;) and ↓ <br>\

      رَيَّعَ [which is the same as رَيَّعَتِ الحِنْطَةُ]; (TA;) <i>The wheat increased,</i> or <i>augmented;</i> or <i>received increase and blessing from God;</i> or <i>throve by the blessing of God:</i> (S, Msb, K, TA:) and in like manner one says of other things. (Msb.) And رَاعَتِ الشَّجَرَةُ, and ↓ <br>\
      اراعت, but the former is rare, <i>The tree became abundant in its produce,</i> or <i>fruit.</i> (AHn.) And sometimes they said, (S,) الاـِبِلُ ↓ <br>\
      اراعت (S, IF, K) (tropical:)  <i>The camels had many young ones;</i> (S;) <i>they increased, and had many young ones.</i> (IF, K.) One says also, رَاعَ الطَّعَامُ, and ↓ <br>\
      اراع, <i>The wheat became redundant;</i> or <i>had a part,</i> or <i>portion, redundant;</i> [app. meaning, <i>over and above the original measure;</i>] <i>in the kneading and the making of bread;</i> syn. صَارَ لَهُ زِيَادَةٌ. (S.) [See the first sentence above; and see رَيْعٌ, below.] And رَاعَ فِى يَدِى كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>Such a thing was redundant,</i> or <i>remained over and above, in my hand;</i> as also رَاقَ; syn. زَادَ: (L in this art., and TA in art. روع:) Sgh has mistranscribed the explanation, زاد, in his two books, [the TS and the O,] writing فَادَ; and the author of the K has imitated him in mentioning this in art. روع, instead of the present art., which is its proper place, but has written for the explanation اَفَادَ. (TA.)       -A2-  رَاعَ, aor. يَرِيعُ, (IDrd, S, K,) inf. n. رَيْعٌ, (S, TA,) <i>He,</i> or <i>it, returned; went,</i> or <i>came, back; reverted:</i> (IDrd, S, K:) and رَاعَ, aor. يَرُوعُ, (IDrd, and K in art. روع,) inf. n. رُوَاعٌ, (K in that art.,) signifies the same; (IDrd, and K in art. روع;) or <i>it returned to its place:</i> (TA in that art.:) but the former verb is the more common. (TA in the present art.) One says, of camels that have run away, صَاحَ عَلَيْهَا الرَّاعِى فَرَاعَتْ اـِلَيْهِ [<i>The pastor cried out at them, and</i>] <i>they returned to him.</i> (TA.) And وَعَظْتُهُ فَاَبِى اَنْ يَرِيعَ [<i>I exhorted him, but he refused</i>] <i>to return,</i> or <i>revert.</i> (TA.) And فُلَانٌ مَا يَرِيعُ بِكَلَامِكَ وَلا بِصَوْتِكَ <br>\
                  <i>Such a one does not return,</i> or <i>revert, by reason of thy speech nor by reason of thy voice.</i> (TA.) And you say of vomit, رَاعَ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ <br>\
                  <i>Somewhat of it returned:</i> (S:) and رَاعَ عَلَيْهِ <br>\
                  <i>it returned to his inside.</i> (TA.) And in like manner one says of anything that returns to him, رَاعَ, aor. يَرِيعُ. (TA.) ―         -b2-  رَاعُوا, <i>They drew, gathered,</i> or <i>collected, themselves together;</i> (Ibn- &#39;Abbád, TA;) as also ↓ <br>\

(S.)       -A4-  [It is also said that] رَاعَ, aor. يَرِيعُ, is like رَدَّ [app. as signifying <i>He returned a reply,</i> or <i>an answer,</i> to a person; for it is mentioned immediately after رَيْعٌ as syn. with مَرْجُوعٌ].
