                  , inf. n. رُجُوعٌ (S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.) and رَجْعٌ, (M, Msb,) but the former is that which commonly obtains and is agreeable with analogy as inf. n. of the intrans. v., and the latter as inf. n. of the trans. v., (MF, TA,) and مَرْجَعٌ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.,) which is anomalous, because inf. ns. [of this kind] of verbs of the measure فَعَلَ having the  aor. of the measure يَفْعِلُ are [by rule] only with fet-h [to the medial radical], (S, K,) and مَرْجِعَةٌ, which is in like manner anomalous, (K,) and رُجْعَى, (S, Msb, K,) [not رُجْعًى as in the Lexicons of Golius and Freytag,] and رُجْعَانٌ, (K,) <i>He returned; he went,</i> or <i>came, back</i> [to the same place, or person, or (assumed tropical:)  state, or (assumed tropical:)  occupation, or (assumed tropical:)  action, or (assumed tropical:)  saying, &amp;amp;c.]; <i>he reverted; contr. of</i> <br>\

                  انْصَرَفَ: (K:) رُجُوعٌ signifies the <i>returning to a former place,</i> or (assumed tropical:)  <i>quality,</i> or (assumed tropical:)  <i>state;</i> (Kull p. 196;) the <i>returning to that from which was the commencement,</i> or <i>from which the commencement is supposed to have been, whether it be a place,</i> or (assumed tropical:)  <i>an action,</i> or (assumed tropical:)  <i>a saying, and whether the returning be by the</i> [<i>whole</i>] <i>person or thing,</i> or <i>by a part thereof,</i> or <i>by an action thereof.</i> (Er-Rághib.) Hence the saying in the Kur [lxiii. 8], لَيِنْ رَجَعْنَا اـِلَى المَدِينَةِ [<i>Verily if we return to the city</i>]. (Er-Rághib.) And [in the same, xii. 63,] فَلَمَّا رَجَعُوا اـِلَى اَبِيهِمْ [<i>And when they returned to their father</i>]. (Idem.) And in the same, [vi. 164, and xxxix. 9,] ثُمَّ اـِلَى رَبِّكُمْ مَرْجِعُكُمْ [<i>Then unto your Lord shall be your return</i>]: (S:) the like of which occurs in the same, vi. 60: but it may be either from [the intrans. inf. n.] رُجُوعٌ or from [the trans.] رَجْعٌ: (Er-Rághib:) it cannot be a n. of place, because it is made trans. by means of اـِلَى, and also because it occurs in the Kur [v. 53, &amp;amp;c.], followed by جَمِيعًا, as a denotative of state: (L:) in like manner الرُّجْعَى also occurs in the Kur xcvi. 8.

                  <i>He returned in the way by which he had come.</i> (Kull ibid.) ―         -b4-  رَجَعَ مِنْ سَفَرِهِ <br>\

                  الذَّنْبِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He relinquished sin;</i> i. e.] <i>he repented;</i> and so رَجَعَ alone, agreeably with the usage in the Kur iii. 65, &amp;amp;c. (Er-Rághib.) ―         -b8-  [Several other phrases, in which this verb occurs, will be found in other arts.: as رَجَعَ عَلَى ظَهْرِهِ in art. ظهر: رَجَعْتُ القَهْقَرَى in art. قهقر: رَجَعَ دَرَجَهُ, and variations thereof, in art. درج: &amp;amp;c.] ―         -b9-  رَجَعَ اـِلَيْهِ [sometimes signifies the same as رَجَعَ عَلَيْهِ] <i>He returned against him; he returned to attack him.</i> (TA.) ―         -b10-  صَرَمّنِى ثُمَّ رَجَعَ يَكَلِّمُنِى (tropical:)  [<i>He cut me,</i> or <i>ceased to speak to me; then he returned to speaking to me</i>].

                  قَوْلِى (tropical:)  [<i>He opposed me,</i> or <i>disagreed with me; then he returned,</i> or <i>had regard, to my saying</i>].

[رَجَعَ اـِلَيْهِ often means <i>He had recourse,</i> or <i>he recurred, to him,</i> or <i>it.</i>] ―         -b13-  رَجَعَ بِهِ عَلَى شَرِيكِهِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He made a claim for restitution of it upon his co-partner.</i> (IAth, TA in art. خلط.) And [in like manner you say,] عَلَى الغَرِيمِ ↓ <br>\
      اِرْتَجَعَ, and المُتَّهَمِ, (assumed tropical:)  <i>He sued, prosecuted,</i> or <i>made a demand upon, the debtor,</i> and <i>the suspected, for his right,</i> or <i>due.</i> (TA: [in which it is said, immediately before this, that ارتجع is like رَجَعَ.]) ―         -b14-  رَجَعَ الكَلْبُ فِى قَيْيِهِ <br>\
                  <i>The dog returned to his vomit,</i> (Msb, TA,) <i>and ate it.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b15-  Hence, رَجَعَ فِى هِبَتِهِ (tropical:)  <i>He took back his gift; repossessed himself of it; restored it to his possession;</i> (Msb;) as also ↓ <br>\
      ارتجعها, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) and ↓ <br>\
      استرجعها. (Msb, TA.) And مِنْهُ الشَّىْء ↓ <br>\
      استرجع (assumed tropical:)  <i>He took back from him the thing which he had given to him.</i> (S, K.) ―         -b16-  [Hence also, رَجَعَ فِى قَوْلِهِ, and فِى حُكْمِهِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He retracted,</i> or <i>revoked, his saying,</i> and <i>his judgment,</i> or <i>sentence.</i>] ―         -b17-  هُوَ يَرْجِعُ اـِلَى مَنْصِبِ صِدْقٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He traces back his lineage to an excellent origin.</i> (TA in art. نصب.) ―         -b18-  [يَرْجِعُ اـِلَى مَعْنَى كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  <i>It</i> (a word used in a certain sense) <i>is referrible,</i> or <i>reducible, to such a meaning.</i> And يُرْجِعُ اـِلَى كَذَا, said of a word, also means (assumed tropical:)  <i>It relates to such a thing;</i> i. e., to such another word, in grammatical construction.] ―         -b19-  رَجَعَ اـِلَى قَدْرِ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  <i>It</i> (wine when cooked) <i>became reduced to such a quantity;</i> syn. ا=لَ. (S in art. اول.) ―         -b20-  رَجَعَ الحَوْضُ اـِلَى اـِزَايِهِ <br>\
                  <i>The water of the trough,</i> or <i>tank, became much in quantity</i> [<i>so that it returned to the height of the place whence it poured in</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b21-  ↓ <br>\
      رِجَاعٌ, also, is an inf. n. of this verb, (L,) and is used as signifying The <i>returning</i> of birds <i>after</i> their <i>migrating to a hot country.</i> (S, L, K.) You say, رَجَعَتِ الطَّيْرُ القَوَاطِعُ, inf. n. رِجَاعٌ and رَجْعٌ, <i>The migratory birds returned.</i> (L.) ―         -b22-  Also inf. n. of رَجَعَتْ said of a-she camel, and of a she-ass, signifying (assumed tropical:)  <i>She raised her tail, and compressed her two sides</i> (قُطْرَيْهَا), <i>and cast forth her urine in repeated discharges, so that she was imagined to be pregnant,</i> (S, K,) <i>and then failed of fulfilling her</i> [<i>apparent</i>] <i>promise:</i> (S: [in some copies of which, as is said in the TA, the inf. n. of the verb in this sense is written رُجُوع:]) or <i>she conceived, and then failed of fulfilling her promise;</i> because she who does so goes back from what is hoped of her: (TA:) or, said of a she-camel, <i>she cast forth her fœtus in an imperfect state:</i> (AZ, TA,) or, as some say, <i>her embryo in a fluid state:</i> (TA:) or <i>in an unformed state;</i> inf. n. رِجَاعٌ. (Msb in art. خدج.) [See also رَاجِعٌ, below.]       -A2- , (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. رَجَعَهُ, (Mgh,) inf. n. رَجْعٌ and مَرْجَعٌ and مَرْجِعٌ, (K,) <i>He made,</i> or <i>caused, him,</i> or <i>it, to return, go back, come back,</i> or <i>revert; sent back, turned back,</i> or <i>returned, him,</i> or <i>it;</i> syn. رَدَّهُ; (Mgh, Msb, K;) and صَرَفَهُ; (K;) عَنِ الشَّىْءِ <br>\
                  <i>from the thing;</i> and اـِلَيْهِ <br>\
                  <i>to it;</i> (Msb, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      ارجعهُ; (S, Msb, K;) but the former is the more chaste word, and is that which is used in the Kur-án, in ix. 84 [and other places]: (Msb:) the latter is of the dial. of Hudheyl; (S, Msb;) and is said by MF to be of weak authority, and bad; but [SM says,] I do not find this asserted by any of the leading authorities: (TA:) ↓ <br>\
      ارتجعهُ, also, signifies [the same, i. e.] the same as رَدَّهُ in like manner followed by اـِلَى. (TA.) Thus in the Kur ix. 84, referred to above, فَاـِنْ رَجَعَكَ اْللّٰهُ [<i>And if God make thee to return,</i> or <i>restore thee</i>]. (Msb.) ―         -b2-  رَجَعَ فُلَانٌ عَلِى اَنْفِ بَعِيِرهِ <br>\
                  <i>Such a one put back,</i> or <i>restored, the nose-rein</i> [الخِطَامَ being understood] <i>upon the nose of his camel;</i> it having become displaced. (TA.) ―         -b3-  رَجَعَ اـِلَىَّ <br>\

                  , inf. n. رَجْعٌ and رُجْعَانٌ, <i>He returned to me the answer.</i> (S, TA: [in the latter of which, this is said to be tropical; but when a written answer is meant, it is evidently not so.]) ―         -b4-  رَجَعْتُ الكَلَامَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>I returned the speech;</i> or <i>I repeated it;</i> or <i>I rebutted,</i> or <i>rejected,</i> or <i>repudiated, it, in reply,</i> or <i>replication;</i> syn. رَدَدْتُهُ.

      التَّرْجِيعُ, (K,) or تَرْجِيعُ الدَّابّةِ يَدَيْهَا فِى السَّيْرِ, (S,) signifies the same: (S, K:) or رَجْعٌ signifies a beast&#39;s <i>elevating,</i> or <i>lifting high, the fore foot and hind foot, in going.</i> (KL.) You say, الدَّابَّةُ يَدَيْهَا فِى ↓ <br>\
      رَجَّعَتِ <br>\
