                  دُوَيْبَّةٌ يُجْلَبُ مِنْهَا الكَافُورُ; and that بَلَدٌ has been substituted as an amendment for دويبّة in some of the copies [of the S]; but that each of these readings is erroneous: for يجلب we find [in copies of the S] in the handwriting of Aboo-Zekereeyà and that of Aboo-Sahl يُحْلَبُ, with the unpointed ح; and the substitution of بلد for دويبَة was made by IKtt: in the copies of the S, moreover, we find مِنْهُ instead of مِنْهَا: and IB says that the passage in J&#39;s original copy, in his own handwriting, runs thus: الرَّبَاحُ اَيْضًا دُوَيْبَّةٌ <br>\
                  كَالسِّنَّورِ يُجْلَبُ مِنْهُ الكَافُورُ. (TA.) [But I find that, in five copies of the S, between السنّور and يجلب, occur the words وَالرَّبَاحُ اَيْضًا بَلَدٌ, or بَلْدَةٌ or اْسْمُ بَلَدٍ: and I think it most probable that J intended to have introduced these or similar words, and therefore wrote مِنْهُ instead of مِنْهَا; meaning that رباح is the appellation of a certain small animal, resembling the cat: and that الرباح is also the name of a country or town from which camphor is brought: this country or town is said in a marginal note in a copy of the S to be in India.]    </entryFree> <br>\
