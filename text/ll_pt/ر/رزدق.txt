                  <i>A row of palm-trees,</i> and <i>of men:</i> (IF, S, Msb, K:) or [simply] <i>a row:</i> (JK, Mgh:) and <i>an extended cord</i> or <i>string</i> or <i>thread:</i> (JK:) an arabicized word, from رَسْتَهْ, (S, K,) which is Persian: (S:) Lth says, What the people [now] call رَسْتَق we call رَزْدَق, meaning <i>a row:</i> it is an adventitious word. (TA.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] one says, اِجْعَلِ الاَمْرَ رَزْدَقًا وَاحِدًا, meaning <i>Make thou the affair,</i> or <i>case,</i> [<i>uniform,</i> or] <i>one uniform thing.</i> (Fr, TA in art. باح.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   (S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.) and رُزْتَاقٌ (Lh, L, TA) and رُسْدَاقٌ (ISk, K) and رُسْتَاقٌ, (Lh, S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.,) but this last disallowed by ISk, (TA,) [though allowed by many others, and of frequent occurrence,] and said by some to be post-classical, and to be correctly رُزْدَاقٌ, (Msb,) arabicized, (S, Msb, K,) of Pers. origin, (S,) from رُوسْتَا, (K,) [erroneously] said by IF to be from رَزْدَقٌ signifying as explained above; (Msb;) <i>A rural district;</i> or <i>district consisting of cultivated land with towns</i> or <i>villages;</i> syn. سَوَادٌ, (S,) or سَوَادٌ and قُرًي: (K:) Yákoot explains رُسْتَاق as applied, in his time, in the country of the Persians, to <i>any place</i> [or <i>district</i>] <i>in which are sown fields, and towns or villages;</i> not to cities, like El-Basrah and Baghdád; so that it is, with the Persians, like سَوَادٌ with the people of Baghdád, and is a more special term than كُورَةٌ [in Arabic] and اـِسْتَان [in Persian]: (TA:) or it is used as meaning <i>an outlying district,</i> or <i>a border-district, of a country:</i> (Msb:) [but the correctness of this last explanation is questionable:] the pl. is رَزَادِيقُ (Msb) [and رَزَاتِيقُ and رَسَادِيقُ] and رَسَاتِيقُ (S, Msb) and رُزْدَاقَاتٌ (Har p. 249) [&amp;amp;c.].   </entryFree> <br>\
