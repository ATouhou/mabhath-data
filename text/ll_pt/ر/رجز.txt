                  <i>A certain disease which attacks camels, in the rump;</i> (S, K;) <i>so that when a she-camel rises, or is roused, her thighs tremble for a while, and then stretch out:</i> (S:) or <i>it is when there is a convulsive motion in the hind leg or the thighs of a camel, when he desires to stand up, or rises, or is roused, for a while, and then a stretching out of the same.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  Hence, (S,) الرَّجَزُ is the name of <i>A certain species</i> [or <i>kind</i>] <i>of verse</i> or <i>poetry;</i> (S, A, K;) <i>a species</i> [or <i>kind</i>] <i>of the metres of verse;</i> (Msb;) <i>consisting of the measure</i> <br>\
                  مُسْتَفْعِلُنْ [<i>primarily</i>] <i>six times:</i> (K:) a metre easy to the ear and impressive to the mind; wherefore it may be reduced to a single hemistich, and also to two feet instead of six: (TA:) so called because it commences with a motion and a quiescence, [i. e., a movent and a quiescent letter,] followed by a motion and a quiescence; and so in the other feet; resembling the رَجَز in a she-camel, which consists in her quivering and then being quiet: (TA:) or because of the contractedness of its feet, and the fewness of its letters: (S, K:) or because it is [characterized by] صُدُور without اَعْجَاز [lit. breasts without rumps; for, as the two hemistichs generally rhyme with each other, the verse seems as though it had no عَجُز; i. e., as though its last foot should rather be called عَرُوضٌ, like the last of the first hemistich, than عَجُزٌ:] (TA:) Akh once said, رَجَزٌ, with the Arabs, is <i>whatever consists of three feet;</i> and it is that [kind of verse] which they sing in their work, and in driving their camels: [see بِذْلَةٌ, last sentence:] ISd says that certain of those in whom he placed confidence related this on the authority of Kh. (TA.) Some say that it is not verse, or poetry, but a kind of rhyming prose; but Kh held it to be true verse, or poetry: so in the M: but in the T it is said [as in the K] that Kh asserted it to be not poetry, but halves or thirds of verses: one of his reasons for this assertion [the only one that seems to have had much weight with the Muslims] is, that Mo- hammad once said, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
