(IAth, TA.) [Hence also] one says, هٰذَا الاَمْرُ فِى رِقَابِكُمْ (tropical:)  [<i>This affair is upon your own selves</i>], and فِى رَقَبَتِكَ (tropical:)  [<i>upon thine own self</i>]. (A.)

And [hence], in another trad., لَنَا رِقَابُ الاَرْضِ (tropical:)  <i>To us belongs the land itself.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  Hence also, i. e. by a synecdoche, (IAth, Mgh, TA,) (tropical:)  <i>A slave,</i> (S, IAth, Mgh, K, TA,) <i>male</i> and <i>female:</i> (IAth, TA:) and <i>a captive:</i> (TA:) pl. رِقَابٌ.

And فَكَّ رَقَبَةً (tropical:)  <i>He released a slave,</i> or <i>a captive.</i> (TA.) الرِّقَاب in the Kur ix. 60 means (tropical:)  <i>Those slaves who have contracted with their owners for their freedom.</i> (T, Mgh, Msb, TA.) ―         -b4-  رِقَابُ المَزَاوِدِ (tropical:)  [lit. <i>The necks of provision-bags</i>] is a nickname which was applied to <i>the</i> <br>\

(JK, KT. *) [It also signifies The <i>property so given.</i>] See 4, in three places. The act thus termed is forbidden in a trad., which pronounces that the property so given belongs to the giver&#39;s heirs. (JK.) Accord. to the Imám Aboo-Haneefeh, and [the Imám] Mohammad, it is not a هِبَة: accord. to Aboo-Yoosuf, it is a هِبَة like the عُمْرَى; but none of the lawyers of El- &#39;Irák says so: the Málikees absolutely forbid it. (TA.) You say, دَارِى لَكَ رُقْبَى [<i>My house is thine as a</i> <br>\

(TA.) A poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        اـِذَا قَسَمَ الهَوَى اَعْشَارَ قَلْبِى<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        فَسَهْمَاكِ المُعَلَّى وَالرَّقِيبُ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>When love divides the tenths of my heart, thy two arrows will be the mo&#39;allà and the rakeeb</i>]: by the سَهْمَانِ, [which properly signifies <i>two arrows,</i> and hence (assumed tropical:)  <i>two portions gained by two gaming-arrows,</i> and then (assumed tropical:)  <i>any two portions,</i>] he means her eyes: and as the معلّى has seven portions and the رقيب has three, the سهمان would gain the whole of his heart. (TA. [See also a verse cited voce عُشْرٌ.]) ―         -b6-  رَقِيبُ النَّجْمِ signifies (tropical:)  <i>The star,</i> or <i>asterism, that sets with the rising of that</i> [<i>other</i>] <i>star,</i> or <i>asterism:</i> for example, the رقيب of الثُّرَيَّا is الاـِكْلِيلُ: [and the former is the رقيب of the latter:] when the latter rises at nightfall, the former sets: (S, TA:) or رَقِيبٌ signifies the <i>star,</i> or <i>asterism, which</i> [<i>as it were</i>] <i>watches,</i> (يُرَاقِبُ,) <i>in the east, the star,</i> or <i>asterism, setting in the west:</i> or <i>any one of the Mansions of the Moon</i> is the رقيب of another: (K, TA:) whenever any one of them rises, another [of them] sets: (TA: [see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل; and see also نَوْءٌ:]) and الرَّقِيبُ is (assumed tropical:)  <i>a</i> [<i>certain</i>] <i>star,</i> or <i>asterism, of the stars,</i> or <i>asterisms,</i> [<i>that were believed to be the givers</i>] <i>of rain, that</i> [<i>as it were</i>] <i>watches another star,</i> or <i>asterism:</i> (K:) [it was app. applied to الاـِكْلِيلُ, as being the رقيب of the most noted and most welcome of all the Mansions of the Moon, namely, الثُّرَيَّا: see نَوْءٌ.] The رَقِيب of الثُّرَيَّا is [also] an appellation applied to الدَّبَرَانُ (assumed tropical:)  [i. e. <i>The Hyades;</i> or <i>the five chief stars of the Hyades;</i> or <i>the brightest star among them,</i>        <br>\
                  <orth lang=&quot;gr&quot;>α</orth> <br>\
                  <i>of Taurus</i>]; because a follower thereof: (A:) [and] العَيُّوقُ (assumed tropical:)  [i. e. <i>Capella</i>] is so called as being likened to the رقيب of the game called المَيْسِر. (TA.) [Hence,] one says, لَاا=تِيكَ اَوْ يَلْقَى الثُّرَيَّا رَقِيبُهَا (tropical:)  [<i>I will not come to thee unless their</i> <br>\
                  رقيب <br>\
                  <i>meet the Pleiades</i>]. (A.) ―         -b7-  رَقِيبٌ also signifies (tropical:)  A man&#39;s <i>successor,</i> (A, K,) <i>of</i> his <i>offspring,</i> and <i>of</i> his عَشِيرَة [i. e. <i>kinsfolk,</i> or <i>nearer</i> or <i>nearest relations by descent from the same ancestor,</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (K.) So in the saying, نِعْمَ الرَّقِيبُ اَنْتَ لِاَبِيكَ وَسَلَفِكَ (tropical:)  [<i>Excellent,</i> or <i>most excellent, is the successor;</i> such art <i>thou to thy father and thine ancestors</i>]: because the successor is like الدَّبَرَان to الثُّرَيَّا. (A.) ―         -b8-  And (assumed tropical:)  The <i>son of a paternal uncle.</i> (K.) [App. because two male cousins by the father&#39;s side are often rivals, and watchers of each other; the son of a girl&#39;s paternal uncle being commonly preferred as her husband.] ―         -b9-  Also (assumed tropical:)  <i>A species of serpent:</i> as though it watched by reason of hatred: (TA:) or <i>a certain malignant serpent:</i> pl. رَقِيبَاتٌ and رُقُبٌ.
