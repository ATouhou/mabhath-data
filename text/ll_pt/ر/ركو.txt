                  تَوْر, <i>of leather;</i> (ISd, TA;) <i>a small drinking-vessel of skin:</i> (Nh, TA:) or <i>a small</i> <br>\
                  دَلْو [or <i>bucket,</i> generally <i>of leather</i>], (Mgh, Msb,) <i>well known:</i> (Msb:) all of these explanations have been strangely neglected by the author of the K: (TA:) pl. رِكَا=ءٌ (S, Mgh, Msb) and رَكَوَاتٌ; (S,) Msb;) the latter allowable. (Msb.) The prov. (S) صَارَتِ القَوْسُ رَكْوَةً [lit. <i>The bow became a</i> <br>\
                  ركوة, app. meaning <i>the bow became exchanged for a vessel such as is called</i> <br>\
                  ركوة, but see what follows,] is applied in relation to the retiring of good fortune, and reverse in the state of affairs. (S, K.) ―         -b2-  <i>A small</i> <br>\

[Hence, accord. to the TK, the prov. above mentioned: but I see not why.] ―         -b4-  (assumed tropical:)  The فَلْهَم of a woman; i. e. her فَرْج [or <i>vulva</i>]: so in the copies of the K: but in the T, her قُلْفَة [i. e. the <i>prepuce of the clitoris</i>], on the authority of IAar; as being likened to the ركوة of water: (TA:) the pl. [app. in all its senses] is رِكَا=ءٌ and رَكَوَاتٌ [as above], (K,) or in the last sense رُكًى. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

      رَكِىٌّ, (S, and so in some copies of the K,) or the former is the pl. and ↓ the latter is [properly speaking] a gen. n., [i. e. a coll. gen. n.,] and often occurs as a sing. and as a pl., (Nh, TA,) or the pl. is also رُكِىٌّ: (so in some copies of the K and in the TA:) accord. to ISd, it is from رَكَا in the first of the senses assigned to this verb above.

                  جرموز, agreeably with what here follows, and with an explanation of this word in the TA voce حَوِىٌّ:] Az, after mentioning AA&#39;s explanation given above, says, but what I have heard from the Arabs is, that the مركوّ is <i>a small watering-trough</i> or <i>tank, which a man makes,</i> or <i>forms,</i> or <i> fashions, in a suitable manner, with his hands, at the head of the well, when he has not, and cannot procure, a vessel in which to give water to a camel or to two camels:</i> and that which is large is not thus called.
