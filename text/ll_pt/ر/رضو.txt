                     ذ<br>\
                   is originally رَضِوَ; the و being changed into ى because of the kesreh: (S:) the tribe of Teiyi said رَضَا for رَضِىَ. (IDrd in his lex., cited by Freytag; and Mughnee voce اـِلَى there said to be a dial. var. of رَضِىَ.) You say, رَضِىَ عَنْهُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) and عَلَيْهِ, (M, Msb, K,) which is of the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, (Msb,) the verb being thus made trans. by means of على, accord. to Ks, agreeably with the opinion of Sb respecting instances of this kind, for the purpose of making it to accord with its contr., سَخِطَ, (M, TA,) aor. يَرْضَى, (K,) inf. n. رِضًى (S, M, Msb, K) and رُضًى (M, K) and رِضْوَانٌ and رُضْوَانٌ, (S, * M, Msb, * K,) the last of the dial. of Keys and Temeem, (Msb, TA,) and mentioned by Sb, (M, TA,) but all the readers of the Kur read رضوان with kesr, except &#39;Ásim, who is related to have read it with damm, (T, TA,) and مَرْضَاةٌ, (S, * M, K,) originally مَرْضَوَةٌ, (TA,) <i>He was pleased, well pleased, content, contented,</i> or <i>satisfied, with him; regarded him with good will,</i> or <i>favour;</i> or <i>liked,</i> or <i>approved, him;</i> (MA;) [i. e., as said above,] <i>contr. of</i> <br>\
                  سَخِطَ; (M, Msb, K;) the object being a person: (Msb:) and Sb states that they also said رَضْيُوا, with the medial radical quiescent, for رَضُوا; but it is extr. (M, TA.) The saying in the Kur [v. last verse but one, and ix. 101, &amp;amp;c.] رَضِىَ اْللّٰهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ [<i>God is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him</i>] means <i>God is well pleased with their deeds and they are well pleased with the recompense that He has bestowed upon them:</i> (M, TA:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib, رِضَى العَبْدِ <br>\
                  عَنِ اْللّٰهِ means <i>The servant&#39;s,</i> or <i>man&#39;s, being not displeased with that which God&#39;s decree has made to happen to him;</i> and رِضَى اْللّٰهِ عِنِ العَبْدِ, <i>God&#39;s seeing the servant,</i> or <i>man, to be obedient to that which He has commanded, and refraining from that which He has forbidden.</i> (TA.) You say also, رَضِيتُهُ, (S, Msb, K,) and رَضِيتُ بِهِ, (M, Msb,) inf. n. رِضًى (Msb, TA) [and رُضًى and رِضْوَانٌ &amp;amp;c., as above]; and ↓ <br>\
      اِرْتَضَيْتُهُ; (S, Msb;) <i>I was pleased, well pleased, content, contented,</i> or <i>satisfied, with it; regarded it with good will,</i> or <i>favour;</i> or <i>liked,</i> or <i>approved, it:</i> (MA: [for the verb is there said to have the same signification in the phrases رَضِيَهُ and رَضِىَ بِهِ as it has in رَضِىَ <br>\
                  عَنْهُ and عَلَيْهِ; and ارتضاه is there similarly explained: and the like is implied in the S and K; and is evidently agreeable with general usage:]) or <i>he chose it,</i> or <i>preferred it:</i> (Msb, TA:) the object being a thing: (S, Msb, TA:) or (accord. to explanations of تَرْضَاهَا in the Kur ii. 139) <i>I loved it,</i> or <i>liked it;</i> (Ksh, Bd, Jel;) <i>inclined to it;</i> (Ksh;) <i>had a desire for it.</i> (Bd.) The saying of the lawyers, [respecting a woman whose consent to her marriage has been asked,] يَشْهَدُ عَلَى رِضَاهَا means <i>It</i> [i. e. her silence] <i>testifies,</i> or <i>declares, her permission</i> [or <i>consent</i>]; because permission indicates رِضًى. (Msb.) You say also, رَضِيتُ بِهِ صَاحِبًا [<i>I was pleased with him,</i> or <i>I liked him,</i> or <i>approved him,</i> or <i>chose him,</i> or <i>preferred him, as a companion</i>]. (S.) And رَضِيَهُ لِذٰلِكَ الاَمْرِ, and ↓ <br>\
      ارتضاهُ, [which may be well rendered <i>He approved him for that thing,</i> or <i>affair,</i>] meaning <i>he saw him,</i> or <i>judged him, to be fit for that thing,</i> or <i>affair.</i> (M.) And لِصُحْبَتِهِ وَخِدْمَتِهِ ↓ <br>\
      ارتضاهُ (K, TA) <i>He</i> [<i>approved him,</i> or] <i>chose him,</i> or <i>preferred him;</i> and <i>saw him,</i> or <i>judged him, to be fit; for his companionship, and his service.</i> (TA.) And رُضِيَتْ مَعيشَتُهُ [<i>His living,</i> or <i>sustenance, was found pleasing, well pleasing, contenting,</i> or <i>satisfying;</i> or <i>was liked,</i> or <i>approved</i>]: one should not say رَضِيَتة [in this case]. (S, K.) ―         -b2-  رَضَوْتُهُ, (S, M, K,) aor. اَرْضُوهُ, (S, K,) signifies <i>I surpassed him in</i> <br>\

      رَاضَانِى [<i>He vied,</i> or <i>contended, with me in being pleased, well pleased, content,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>and I surpassed him therein</i>]: (S, M, K:) the inf. n. of راضانى thus used is مُرَاضَاةٌ and رِضَا=ءٌ; (M;) both these signify the same (K, TA) as inf. ns. of this verb.

Hence, in the Kur [ix. 8], يُرْضُونَكُمْ بِاَفْوَاهِهِمْ وَتَاْبَى قُلُوبُهُمْ [<i>They will please you,</i> or <i>content you, with their mouths, but their hearts will be incompliant</i>]. (TA.)

(M.) ―         -b2-  [Also] تَرَضَّيْتُهُ <br>\
                  <i>I pleased, contented,</i> or <i>satisfied, him</i> (اَرْضَيْتُهُ) <i>after striving, labouring,</i> or <i>toiling.</i> (S.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>They agreed among themselves in being pleased, contented,</i> or <i>satisfied, with it;</i> or <i>in liking,</i> or <i>approving, it.</i> (MA.) اـِذَا تَرَاضَوْا بَيْنَهُمْ, in the Kur [ii. 232], means [<i>When they agree,</i> or <i>consent, among themselves;</i> or] <i>when they are pleased, well pleased, content,</i> &amp;amp;c., [<i>among themselves,</i>] <i>every one of them with his</i> [or <i>her</i>] <i>companion.</i> (TA.)
