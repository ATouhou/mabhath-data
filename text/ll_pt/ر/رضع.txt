(Msb.) The phrase لَيِيمٌ رَاضِعٌ [i. e. <i>Mean, sordid,</i> or <i>ignoble; who sucks the teats of his she-camels,</i> &amp;amp;c.,] originated, (S, K,) as they assert, (S,) from a certain man&#39;s sucking the teats of his she-camels (S, K) or ewes or she-goats, and not milking them, (S,) lest the sound of his milking should be heard and somewhat should be demanded of him: (S, K:) or the origin was the coming of a guest by night to a certain man of the Amalekites, whereupon the latter sucked the udder of his ewe, lest the guest should hear the sound of the streaming of the milk from the teat.

                   and مُرْضَعَةٌ A mother [or other woman] <i>suckling:</i> (Msb:) or one <i>having with her a child which she suckles:</i> the former epithet may with reason be applied to the mother because suckling is performed only by females, like as the epithets حَايِضٌ and طَامِثٌ are applied to a woman; and if مُرْضَعَةٌ were applied to her who has with her a child, it would be correct: (Fr, TA:) [but see another saying ascribed to Fr in what follows:] or the former, a woman <i>having a child which she suckles;</i> (Kh, S, IB, K;) after the manner of a possessive epithet; (IB;) i. e. <i>having a</i> <br>\
                  رَضِيع; (Kh, IB;) like اِمْرَاَةٌ مُطْفِلٌ “ a woman having a طِفْل; ” (Kh;) or ظَبْيَةٌ مُشْدِنٌ “ a doe-gazelle having a شَادِن; ” though مُرْضِعٌ has a verb bearing a signification agreeing with this; and it sometimes occurs as meaning <i>having milk, though not having a child that is suckled:</i> (IB:) but the latter is used in describing a woman as performing an action; (Kh;) signifying <i>suckling a child:</i> (S, K:) the former is used when the [abstract] quality is meant: the latter, when the action is meant: but God knows: (Akh:) or the former signifies one <i>who is near to suckling, but has not yet suckled:</i> and one <i>having with her the child that is suckled</i> [<i>by her</i>] (الصَّبِىُّ الرَّضِيعُ): and the latter, [in the TA the former, but this is a mistranscription, as is shown by what follows,] one <i>who is suckling, her teat being in the mouth of her child;</i> and in this sense it is used in the Kur, in a passage which see below: (AZ in the TA:) Th says, the latter signifies one <i>who suckles, though she have not a child,</i> or <i>if she have a child:</i> and the former, one <i>who has not a child with her,</i> and sometimes <i>having with her a child:</i> and in one place he says, when the action is meant, the latter is used, and it is made an epithet: and when the ة is not added, it is meant as a subst: (TA:) Fr and some others say that it is without ة when the proper signification of <i>suckling</i> is meant: and with ة when the tropical signification of <i>a subject of the attribute of suckling in time past or future</i> is meant: (Msb:) the pl. [of both, though said in the Mgh and TA to be that of the former,] is مَرَاضِعُ (Mgh, Msb, TA) and مَرَاضِيعُ. (Msb, TA.) The saying in the Kur [xxii. 2], يَوْمَ تَرَوْنَهَا تَذْهَلُ كُلُّ مُرْضِعَةٍ عَمَّا <br>\
                  اَرْضَعَتْ means [<i>On the day when ye shall see it,</i>] <i>every woman that is suckling;,</i> (AZ, Kh,) <i>in the act of doing so,</i> (Kh,) <i>with her teat in the mouth of her child;</i> (AZ,) [<i>shall neglect,</i> or <i>become heedless of</i> or <i>diverted from, that which she shall have been suckling:</i>] or مرضعة here has the last signification explained in the preceding sentence [so that the meaning is <i>every woman who shall have been suckling or shall be going to suckle</i>]. (Msb.) ―         -b2-  It is said in a trad., نِعْمَتِ المُرْضِعَةُ وَبِيْسَتِ الفَاطِمَةُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Excellent in the office of commander,</i> or <i>governor, and the profit,</i> or <i>advantage, which it brings to its possessor; and very evil is death, which destroys his delights,</i> or <i>pleasures, and stops the profits,</i> or <i>advantages, of that office.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  The pl. مَرَاضِيعُ is metaphorically applied as an epithet to bees (جَوَارِس, i. e. نَحْل).
