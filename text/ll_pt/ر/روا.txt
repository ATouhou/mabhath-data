                  <i>A kind of</i> [<i>plant,</i> or] <i>tree,</i> (T, * S, M, K, &amp;amp;c.,) <i>that grows in plain,</i> or <i>soft, land,</i> (T, M, TA,) <i>having a white fruit:</i> or, as some say, <i>a kind of dust-coloured tree, having a red fruit:</i> (M, TA:) n. un. رَا=ءَةٌ: (T, S, M, K:) and dim. ↓ <br>\
      رُوَيْيَةٌ: (M, TA:) AHn says that the را=ءة is <i>not taller nor broader than a sitting man:</i> and accord. to one of the Arabs of the desert of &#39;Omán, it is <i>a tree that rises on a stem, and then there branch forth</i> [so in the M, but accord. to the TA, <i>rise,</i>] <i>from it round, rough leaves:</i> others, he adds, say that <i>it is a small tree of the mountains, resembling an</i> <br>\
                  عظلمة [q. v.], <i>having a soft white flower like cotton:</i> (M, TA: [but in the latter, the word rendered “ soft ” is omitted:]) some say that <i>it is a species of the kind of tree called</i> <br>\
                  طَلْح [<i>acacia,</i> or <i>mimosa, gummifera</i>], <i>and is the tree that grew at the cave in which were the Prophet and Aboo-Bekr:</i> so say Suh and others: <i>it is,</i> they say, <i>of the height of a man, and has white flowers, resembling cotton, with which cushions are stuffed, like feathers in lightness and softness:</i> it is said by IHsh to be <i>the same</i> [<i>tree</i>] <i>that is called</i> <br>\

                  عُشَر [<i>asclepias gigantea</i>], as one author has supposed; <i>but a tree resembling this:</i> (MF, TA:) such is the truth: the را=ء is not the عشر: I have seen them both [says SM] in El-Yemen; and with the fruit of each of them cushions and pillows are stuffed: but the fruit of the عشر commences small; then increases to the size of the باذنجانة [or fruit of the egg-plant, and much larger, like a bladder]; and then breaks open, disclosing what is like cotton: and the fruit of the را=ء is not thus: the عشر [he adds] is not found in Egypt; but it and the را=ء are peculiar to El- Hijáz and the neighbouring parts; [in saying this, however, he errs; for I have seen the عشر in abundance in the deserts of the upper part of the Sa&#39;eed;] and the saddles of camels &amp;amp;c. are stuffed with the fruit of the را=ء in El-Hijáz.
