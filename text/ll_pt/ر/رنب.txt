<b>اَرْنَبٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     اَرْنَبٌ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                   [The <i>hare;</i> and now applied to the <i>rabbit</i> also;] <i>a certain animal,</i> (TA,) <i>well known,</i> (M, A, K, TA,) <i>like the</i> <br>\
                  عناق [?], <i>having short fore legs and long hind legs, that treads the ground with the hinder parts of its</i> [<i>hind</i>] <i>legs:</i> (TA:) <i>a certain very prolific animal, called in Pers.</i> <br>\
                  خركوش [or خَرْگُوشْ]: <i>it is said that it is one year a male and another year a female, and menstruates like women; and its fore legs are shorter than its hind legs: when it sleeps, it keeps its eyes open; and when it is sick, it eats green canes</i> (قَصَب), <i>and its sickness ceases:</i> (Kzw:) the word is a gen. n., (TA,) of the fem. gender, (Msb, TA,) accord. to El-Jáhidh; (TA;) but (Msb) applied to the <i>male</i> and the <i>female;</i> (M, A, K, TA;) as is also ↓ <br>\
      اَرْنَبَةٌ, (Msb,) which is a dial. var.: (Mgh, Msb:) or to the <i>female</i> [only]; the male being called خُزَزٌ; (T, M, K, TA;) accord. to Lth; but others allow its application to the <i>male:</i> (T:) the female is also called عِكْرِشَةٌ: and the young, خِرْنِقٌ: (TA:) the pl. is اَرَانِبُ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and اَرَانٍ, (Lh, S, M, K,) the latter, like ثَعَالٍ for ثَعَالِبُ, occurring in poetry, (S, M, *) and not allowed by Sb except in poetry. (M.) The ا in اَرْنَبٌ is augmentative, accord. to Lth: accord. to most of the grammarians it is disjunctive, (so in a copy of the T and in the TA,) or radical: (so in another copy of the T:) Lth says that no word commences with a radical ا but such as  is triliteral; as اَرْضٌ and اَرْشٌ. (T, TA.) [Hence,] one says of the low, abject, or ignominious, and weak, اـِنَّمَا هُوَ اَرْنَبٌ [<i>He is only a hare</i>]; because that animal cannot defend itself, and even the lark will endeavour to make it its prey. (A, TA.) See another ex. below, voce اَرْنَبَةٌ. [Hence, also,] الاَرْنَبُ is the name of (assumed tropical:)  <i>A certain constellation,</i> [<i>Lepus,</i>] <i>comprising twelve stars in its figure, having no observed stars around it, situate beneath the feet of</i> <br>\
                  الجَبَّار [i. e. <i>Orion</i>], <i>and facing the west.</i> (Kzw.) ―         -b2-  Also, (K,) or ↓ <br>\
      مَرْنَبٌ accord. to the L, (TA,) or both, (M,) and ↓ <br>\
      يَرْنَبٌ, <i>A</i> <br>\
                  جُرَذ [or <i>large field-rat</i>], (M, L, K,) <i>like the jerboa,</i> (M, L,) <i>having a short tail.</i> (M, L, K.) ―         -b3-  الاَرْنَبُ <br>\
                  البَحْرِىُّ, accord. to Kzw, <i>A certain marine animal, the head of which is like that of the</i> <br>\
                  اَرْنَب [or <i>hare</i>], <i>and the body like that of a fish:</i> or, accord. to Ibn-Seenà, <i>a small testaceous animal, which is of a poisonous quality when drunk</i> [app. meaning <i>in water</i>]: so that, accord. to this explanation, the resemblance [to the ارنب commonly so called] is in the name, not the form. (TA.)       -A2-  Also <i>A sort of ornament worn by women.</i> (M, K.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   The <i>end,</i> or <i>tip,</i> [i. e. the <i>lower portion,</i> or <i>lobule,</i>] <i>of the nose:</i> (T, S, A, K:) this is [also] called اَرْنَبَةُ الاَنْفِ: (Mgh, Msb:) it is one of the parts that touch the ground in prostration [in prayer]: (TA:) pl. اَرَانِبُ. (T, A, TA.) You say, جَدَعَ اَرْنَبَتَهُ [lit. <i>He cut off the end of his nose;</i>] meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>he held him in mean estimation,</i> or <i>in contempt.</i> (A, TA.)
