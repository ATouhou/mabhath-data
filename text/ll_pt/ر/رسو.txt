                  اَيَّانَ مُرْسَاهَا, in the Kur [vii. 186 and lxxix. 42], means [<i>They will ask thee respecting the</i> <br>\
                  ساعة,] <i>when will be its taking place?</i> [or <i>when will be the time of its being made to take place?</i>]; (M, K; *) by the ساعة being meant the time in which all created beings shall die. (M.)    </entryFree> <br>\
