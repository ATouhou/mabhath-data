                   signifies The <i>throwing,</i> or <i>casting, of stones:</i> (S, K:) this is its primary meaning: (S, TA:) you say, رَجَمَهُ, aor.      <br>\
                     رَجُمَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. رَجْمٌ, (S, Msb, TA,) <i>He threw,</i> or <i>cast, stones at him;</i> or <i>pelted him with stones:</i> (S, TA:) or <i>he struck him,</i> or <i>smote him, with</i> <br>\
                  رَجَم, meaning <i>stones:</i> (Msb:) and رُجُومٌ is syn. with رَجْمٌ, as an inf. n.: thus some explain the saying, in the Kur [lxvii. 5], وَجْعَلْنَاهَا رُجُومًا لِلشَّيَاطِينِ [<i>And we have made them for casting at the devils;</i> meaning shooting stars, which are believed to be hurled at the devils that listen by stealth, beneath the lowest heaven, to the words of the angels therein: but see other explanations below, voce رَجْمٌ]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  Hence, (S, TA,) The act of <i>slaying</i> [<i>in any manner,</i> but generally <i>stoning,</i> i. e. <i>putting to death by stoning</i>]. (S, K.) So in رَجْمُ الثَّيِّبَيْنِ اـِذَا زَنَيَا [<i>The slaying,</i> or <i>stoning, of the two married persons when they have committed adultery</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b3-  [(assumed tropical:)  The act of <i>beating,</i> or <i>battering,</i> the ground with the feet.] One says of a camel, يَرْجُمُ الاَرْضَ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He beats,</i> or <i>batters, the ground</i>], i. e., with his feet; which implies commendation: (TA:) and so one says of a horse; (K;) or يُرْجُمُ فِى الاَرْضِ. (S.) And one says also, جَا=ءَ يَرْجُمُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He came beating,</i> or <i>battering, the ground;</i> or] <i>passing along with an ardent and a rapid running.</i> (Lh, K, * TA.) [See also 8.] ―         -b4-  (tropical:)  The act of <i>cursing.</i> (K, TA.) ―         -b5-  (assumed tropical:)  The act of <i>reviling.</i> (K, TA.) لَاَرْجُمَنَّكَ, in the Kur xix. 47, means (assumed tropical:)  <i>I will assuredly revile thee:</i> (Bd, Jel, TA: see also another explanation below, in this paragraph:) or <i>I will assuredly cast stones at thee,</i> (Bd, Jel,) so that thou shalt die, or shalt remove far from me. (Bd.) And you say, رَجَمْتُهُ بِالقَوْلِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>I uttered foul,</i> or <i>evil, speech against him.</i> (Msb.) [See also رَجَبَهُ.] ―         -b6-  (assumed tropical:)  The act of <i>driving away; expelling; putting,</i> or <i>placing, at a distance, away,</i> or <i>far away.</i> (K.) ―         -b7-  (assumed tropical:)  The act of <i>cutting off from friendly,</i> or <i>loving communion</i> or <i>intercourse; forsaking;</i> or <i>abandoning.</i> (K.) ―         -b8-  Also [as being likened to the throwing of stones, in doing which one is not sure of hitting the mark,] <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  قَذْفٌ (K, TA) بِالغَيْبِ (assumed tropical:)  [The act of <i>speaking of that which is hidden,</i> or <i>which has not become apparent to the speaker;</i> <br>\
                   and <i>conjecturing</i>]; (TA;) or <i>speaking conjecturally:</i> (S, TA:) and (K, TA) some say (TA) <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  غَيْبٌ [as meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>a doubting</i>]: (K, TA: [in the CK, العَيْبُ is erroneously put for الغَيْبُ:] and ظَنٌّ [which means (assumed tropical:)  <i>an opining,</i> or <i>a conjecturing</i>]. (K, TA.) One says, رَجَمَ بِالغَيْبِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He spoke of that which he did not know.</i> (Ham p. 494.) And رَجَمَ بِالظَّنِّ (Z, TA) (assumed tropical:)  <i>He spoke conjecturally:</i> (MA:) or <i>he conjectured,</i> or <i>opined.</i> (Bd in xviii. 21.) Hence, قَالَهُ رَجْمًا (assumed tropical:)  <i>He said it conjecturally.</i> (Z, TA.) Hence also, (TA,) رَجْمًا بَالغَيْبِ, in the Kur [xviii. 21], (S, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Speaking conjecturally of that which is hidden,</i> or <i>unknown;</i> as indicated in the S and TA: or] <i>conjecturing in a case hidden</i> from them. (Jel.) One says also, قَالَ رَجْمًا بِالغَيْبِ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  <i>He said conjecturally,</i> [or <i>speaking of that which was hidden from him,</i> or <i>unknown by him,</i>] <i>without evidence, and without proof.</i> (Msb.) And صَارَ رَجْمًا لَا يُوقَفُ عَلَى حَقِيقَةِ اَمْرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>It became a subject of conjecture, the real state of the case whereof one was not to be made to know</i>]. (S, TA.) And لَاَرْجُمَنَّكَ, in the Kur [xix. 47, of which two explanations have been mentioned above], means [accord. to some] <i>I will assuredly say of thee,</i> [though] <i>speaking of that which is hidden</i> [<i>from me</i>], or <i>unknown</i> [<i>by me</i>], <i>what thou dislikest,</i> or <i>hatest.</i> (TA.) ―         -b9-  لِسَانٌ يُرْجُمُ [if the latter word be not a mistranscription for ↓ <br>\
      مِرْجَمٌ, q. v.,] means <i>A tongue that is chaste,</i> or <i>perspicuous, and copious, in speech.</i> (Msb in art. ترجم.) ―         -b10-  See also the next paragraph, in three places.    </entryFree> <br>\

                  رُجَم [meaning <i>large stones,</i> to make a gibbous covering to it]. (TA.) It is related in a trad. of &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-Mughaffal, that he said, لَا تُرَجِّمُوا قَبْرِى, i. e. <i>Place not ye upon my grave</i> <br>\
                  رُجَم; meaning thereby that they should make his grave even with the ground, not gibbous and elevated: the verb is thus correctly, with tesh-deed: but the relaters of trads. say, ↓ <br>\
