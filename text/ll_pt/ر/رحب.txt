      اَرْحَبَت both signify the same, i.e. <i>The house,</i> or <i>abode, was ample,</i> &amp;amp;c.; or <i>may the house,</i> or <i>abode, be ample,</i> &amp;amp;c. (S, TA.) And they said, عَلَيْكَ وَطُلَّتْ ↓ <br>\
      اَرْحَبَتْ, meaning <i>May it</i> (the country, البِلَادُ,) <i>be spacious to thee, and be moistened by gentle rain,</i> or <i>by dew:</i> so accord. to Aboo-Is-hák. (TA.) ضَاقَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الاَرْضُ <br>\
                  بِمَا رَحُبَتْ, in the Kur ix. 119, means <i>The earth became strait to them with</i> [i. e. <i>notwithstanding</i>] <i>its spaciousness.</i> (Bd, Jel.) ―         -b2-  رَحُبَ, accord. to the original usage, is trans. by means of a particle; so that one says, رَحُبَ بِكَ المَكَانُ [<i>The place was,</i> or <i>may the place be, spacious with thee</i>]: afterwards, by reason of frequency of usage, it became trans. by itself; and thus one said, رَحُبَتْكَ الدَّارُ [<i>The house,</i> or <i>abode, was,</i> or <i>may the house,</i> or <i>abode, be, spacious with thee,</i> or <i>to thee</i>]. (Msb.) ―         -b3-  [Hence the saying,] اَرَحُبَكُمُ الدُّخُولُ فِى طَاعَتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Was it proper,</i> or <i>allowable, for you</i> [<i>to enter among his obeyers?</i> i. e., <i>to become obedient to him?</i>]: (S, K * TA:) referring to El-Kirmánee, (so in the S,) or Ibn-El-Kirmánee: (so in the TA:) mentioned by Kh, on the authority of Nasr Ibn-Seiyár; but he says, (S,) the verb thus used is anomalous; (S, K;) for a verb of the measure فَعُلَ is not trans., (K, TA,) accord. to the grammarians, (TA,) except with the tribe of Hudheyl, who, accord. to AAF, make it trans. (K, TA) when its meaning admits of its being so: (TA:) Kh mentions the phrase رَحُبَتْكُمُ الدَّارُ [meaning <i>The house,</i> or <i>abode, was,</i> or <i>may the house,</i> or <i>abode, be, spacious with,</i> or <i>to, you</i>]; but it is thought that there is an ellipsis here, and that it is for رَحُبَتْ بِكُمُ الدَّارُ: and ElJelál Es-Suyootee mentions, on the authority of AAF, the saying رَحُبَ اْللّٰهُ جَوْفَهُ, as meaning وَسَّعَهُ [i. e. <i>May God make wide his belly</i>]: (TA:) [J says, app. quoting Kh,] there is no sound verb of the measure فَعُلَ that is trans. except this; but as to the unsound, there is a difference of opinion: accord. to Ks, قُلْتُهُ is originally قَوُلْتُهُ; but Sb says that this is not allowable, because it is trans.: (S:) Az says that رَحُبَتْكُمْ is not held to be allowable by the grammarians; and that Nasr is not an [approved] evidence.
