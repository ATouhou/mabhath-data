(S, M.) Hence, in the Kur [xxx. 42 and xlii. 46], يَوْمٌ لَا مَرَدَّ لَهُ [<i>A day which there shall be no repelling,</i> or <i>averting</i>], meaning the day of resurrection. (Th, M, L.) One says, اَمْرُ اْللّٰهِ لَا مَرَدَّ لَهُ <br>\

                  <i>He returned, rendered, restored,</i> or <i>sent</i> [<i>back</i>], <i>to him the deposite;</i> (Msb;) and المَنِيحَةَ [<i>the she-camel,</i> or <i>sheep,</i> or <i>goat, lent to him for him to milk her</i>].

[And رَدَدْتُ قَوْلَهُ <br>\
                  <i>I rebutted, rejected,</i> or <i>repudiated, in reply,</i> or <i>replication, his saying, as wrong,</i> or <i>erroneous; refuted it,</i> or <i>refelled it; refused assent to it; controverted it,</i> or <i>contradicted it.</i> And رَدَّ الاَمْرَ <br>\
                  <i>He refused assent,</i> or <i>consent, to the thing,</i> or <i>affair.</i> And رَدَّ عَلَيْهِ الاَمْرَ <br>\
                  <i>He refused him his assent,</i> or <i>consent, to the thing,</i> or <i>affair.</i>] And رَدَّ السَّايِلَ <br>\

(L.) ―         -b3-  رَدَّ البَابَ <br>\
                  <i>He shut,</i> or <i>closed, the door.</i> (Mgh. [See مَرْدُودٌ.]) ―         -b4-  [رَدَّ يَدَهُ اـِلَى سَيْفِهِ is a phrase of frequent occurrence, meaning <i>He put back his hand to his sword;</i> it being hung behind him: (see 4 in art. خلف:) and hence, simply, <i>he put his hand to his sword.</i>] فَرَدُّوا <br>\
                  اَيْدِيَهُمْ فِى اَفْوَاهِهِمْ, in the Kur xiv. 10, means <i>And they put their hands to their mouths</i> by reason of vehement anger or wrath or rage.

                  <i>He repeated to them the oaths.</i> (L in art. جلد.) [In this sense, رِدِّيدَى is one of the inf. ns. in use; as in the following ex.] It is said in a trad., لَا رِدِّيدَى فِى الصَّدَقَةِ [<i>There shall be no repeating in the case of the poor-rate</i>]; (T, S, L;) meaning that the poor-rate shall not be taken twice (T, L) in one year. (L.) [See also 2, which has a similar signification.] ―         -b7-  هٰذَا لَا يَرُدُّ عَلَيْكَ, originally لَا يَرُدُّ عَلَيْكَ شَيْيًا (assumed tropical:)  [<i>This will not return anything to thee</i>], means [<i>this will not bring any return to thee,</i> or] <i>this will not profit thee:</i> (Har p. 483:) and مَا يَرُدُّ عَلَيْكَ هٰذَا (tropical:)  <i>This does not profit thee.</i> (A.) ―         -b8-  رَدَّ اـِلَيْهِ الاَمْرَ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He referred the affair,</i> or <i>case, to him</i> for management or decision: or] <i>he committed to him the affair,</i> or <i>case;</i> syn. فَوَّضَهُ اـِلَيْهِ. (S and A and K in art. فوض.) ―         -b9-  [رَدَّ الشَّىْءَ اـِلَى اَصْلِهِ, a phrase of frequent occurrence, <i>He reduced the thing to its original state.</i>] And رَدَّ الرُّبْعَ خُمْسًا [<i>He reduced the fourth part to a fifth part</i>]. (K in art. ربع.) ―         -b10-  رَدَّ اْللّٰهُ نَفْسِى اـِلَى وَقْتِ اْنْتِهَا=ءِ مُدَّتِى [<i>God brought my soul to the time of the end of my duration</i>]. (IB, TA in art. امر.) ―         -b11-  رَدَّهُ اـِلَى الاَمْرِ [<i>He reduced him to the thing,</i> or <i>affair</i>]: (M and K in art. قصر, in explanation of قَصَرَهُ عَلَى <br>\
                  الاَمْرِ:) or <i>he appropriated him</i> [or <i>it, restrictively,</i>] <i>to the thing,</i> or <i>affair.</i> (TK in that art.) ―         -b12-  رَدَّ ا=خِرَ الشَّىْءِ اـِلَى اَوَّلِهِ, (S and K in art. عكس, &amp;amp;c,) and رَدَّ اَوَّلَهُ عَلَى ا=خِرِهِ, (Msb in the same art., &amp;amp;c.,) [<i>He reversed the thing; made the last part of it to be first,</i> and <i>the first part of it to be last; turned it hind part before,</i> and <i>fore part behind.</i>] And رَدَّ بَعْضَ الاَمْرِ عَلَى بَعْضِ [<i>He reversed the order of part,</i> or <i>of the parts, of the affair,</i> or <i>case</i>]. (TA in art. رك.) And رَدَدْتُ عَلَيْهِ اَمْرَهُ <br>\
                  <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  عَكَسْتُهُ عَلَيْهِ [<i>I reversed to him his affair,</i> or <i>case; I made his affair,</i> or <i>case, to become the contrary of what it was to him</i>]. (Msb in art. عكس.) [Hence,] ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَا لَكُمُ الكَرَّةَ عَلَيْهِمْ, in the Kur xvii. 6, means [<i>Then we gave to you</i>] <i>the turn to prevail against them,</i> or <i>the victory over them.</i> (Bd, Jel.) ―         -b13-  [Hence, also, رَدَّهُ sometimes signifies <i>He,</i> or <i>it, rendered him,</i> or <i>it;</i> or <i>caused him,</i> or <i>it, to become;</i> (like صَيَّرَهُ;) when it has a second objective complement the contrary in meaning to the first; as in the following ex.; and it may have this meaning likewise when it has a second objective complement differing in meaning from the first in a less degree.] A poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
