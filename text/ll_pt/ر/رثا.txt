                     رَثَاَ<br>\
                  , (M, K,) inf. n. رَثْءٌ, (S, M,) <i>He drew</i> milk <i>from the udder upon sour milk, so that it thickened,</i> (S, K,) <i>and became what is termed</i> <br>\
                  رَثِيْيَة: (K:) or <i>he mixed</i> fresh milk with sour milk: or, as some say, <i>he made</i> milk <i>to become what is termed</i> <br>\
                  رَثِيْيَة: (M:) or it has this last signification, and also signifies <i>he mixed</i> [<i>in an absolute sense</i>]. (K.) [Az says,] I heard an Arab of the desert, of Benoo-Mudarris, say to a servant of his, اِرْثَاْ لِى لُبَيْنَةً اَشْرَبُهَا [<i>Mix thou for me a little milk so as to make</i> <br>\
                  رَثِيْيَة, <i>which I will drink</i>]. (T.) And you say, رَثَاَ القَوْمَ (M, K) and رَثَاَ لَهُمْ (M) <i>He made for the party</i> <br>\
                  رَثِيْيَة. (M, K.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] هُمْ يَرْثَوُونَ رَاْيَهُمْ, (S,) and رَثَوُوا رَاْيَهُمْ, (M,) inf. n. as above, (assumed tropical:)  <i>They confuse,</i> or <i>confound,</i> and <i>they confused,</i> or <i>confounded, their judgment,</i> or <i>opinion.</i> (S, M. [See also 8.]) ―         -b3-  And [hence also, perhaps, as رثيية is said to be beaten with a مِجْدَح in the mixing of it,] <i>He beat</i> (K) with a staff, or stick. (TA.)       -A2-  <i>It</i> (anger) <i>became stilled,</i> or <i>appeased.</i> (K.)       -A3-  <i>He</i> (a camel) <i>became affected with the disease termed</i> <br>\
                  رَثْاَة. (K.)       -A4-  Also, (M, K,) inf. n. as above, (M,) a dial. var. of رَثَى, meaning <i>He eulogized</i> a man <i>after his death</i> [<i>in verse</i> or <i>otherwise;</i> or <i>he wept for</i> him, or <i>over</i> him, <i>enumerating his good qualities</i> or <i>actions</i>]: (M, K: *) and in like manner one says of a woman eulogizing her husband after his death; inf. n. مَرْثِيَةٌ: (M:) ISk mentions an Arab woman&#39;s saying رَثَاْتُ زَوْجِى بِاَبْيَاتٍ [<i>I eulogized my husband after his death with verses</i>]; pronouncing the verb with ء; but it is originally without ء: (S, Sgh:) Fr says that her doing this arose from her finding them to say رَثَاْتُ اللَّبَنَ and her therefore supposing المَرْثِيَة to be from the same source: (TA in the present art.:) or, accord. to Fr, their chasteness of speech sometimes induced them to pronounce with ء that which is [properly] without ء; and thus they said رَثَاْتُ المَيِّتَ and لَبَّاْتُ <br>\

                  <i>stills,</i> or <i>appeases, anger:</i> (TA:) alluding to [the effect produced  by] a small kindness: a saying which originated from a man&#39;s being incensed against some persons. and being hungry, and their giving him to drink some رثيية, whereupon his anger became appeased: (S in art. فثا:) hence it became a proverb.
