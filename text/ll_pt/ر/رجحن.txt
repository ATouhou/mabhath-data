                   [part. n. of the verb above]. You say, اَنَا فِى هٰذَا الاَمْرِ مُرْجَحِنٌّ <br>\
                  <i>I am wavering,</i> or <i>vacillating,</i> and <i>inclining, in this affair.</i> (TA.) And اِمْرَاَةٌ مُرْجَحِنَّةٌ <br>\
                  <i>A fat woman, who, when she walks, bends in her gait.</i> (TA.) And جَيْشٌ <br>\

                  <i>A heavy round cloud.</i> (S, * K, * and A in art. رجح. [In the S and K, only the latter word is explained; though the meaning of the former (i. e. سَحَابَةٌ مُسْتَدِيرَةٌ, as in the A,) is plainly indicated in the S by a verse there cited.]) And فُلَانٌ فِى دُنْيَا مُرْجَحِنَّةٍ <br>\

                  <i>Heavy, wide-spreading, night.</i> (TA.) The author of the K follows ISd and J and Az in regarding the ن in this case as radical: but IAth says that some hold it to be augmentative; and the derivation to be from رَجَحَ الشَّىْءُ, meaning “ the thing was, or became, heavy. ” (TA.)   </entryFree> <br>\
