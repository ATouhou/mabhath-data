      نَحْنُ ذَوُو رَهْطٍ: (K, TA:) [the last word in each of these phrases being an inf. n.; unless that in the latter be a mistake for اَرْهُطٍ, (a pl. of رَهْطٌ,) which I find put in the place of رَهْطٍ in a MS. copy of the K:] from Ibn-&#39;Abbád. (TA.) ―         -b2-  In a trad. occurs the phrase, فَاَيْقَظَنَا وَنَحْنُ اْرْتِهَاطٌ [<i>And he waked us,</i>] <i>we being parties collected together,</i> or <i>congregated:</i> the last word being an inf. n. put in the place of the verb [or rather of the part. n., or for ذَوُو اْرَتِهَاطٍ].

                   (Lth, S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.) and ↓ <br>\
      رَهَطٌ, (Lth, Msb, K,) but the former is the more chaste, (Lth, Msb,) A man&#39;s <i>people,</i> and <i>tribe,</i> (S, Msb, K,) <i>consisting of</i> his <i>nearer relations:</i> (Msb:) [i. e. his <i>near kinsfolk:</i>] and <i>a number of men less than ten, among whom is no woman;</i> (AZ, S, Msb, K;) as also نَفَرٌ: (AZ, Msb:) or <i>from seven to ten;</i> (IDrd, Msb, K;) and sometimes <i>a little more;</i> (IDrd;) less than seven, to three, being called نَفَرٌ: (Msb:) or <i>from three to ten:</i> (K:) or <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  عَشِيرَةٌ: (ISk, Msb:) or <i>more than ten, to forty:</i> (As, IF, Msb:) a pl., (S, Msb,) or a word having a pl. meaning, (Th, Az, Msb,) without any proper sing.; (Th, Az, S, Msb, K;) like نَفَرٌ and قَوْمٌ and مَعْشَرٌ and عَشِيرَةٌ; all applied to men, exclusive of women: (Th, Msb:) and ↓ <br>\
      اُرْهُوطٌ signifies the same: (ISh, TA:) the pl. of رهط is اَرْهُطٌ (Lth, S, K) and اَرْهِطَةٌ (Lth) and اَرْهَاطٌ, (S, K,) [all pls. of pauc.,] the last of these being pl. either of رَهَطٌ or of رَهْطٌ, (TA,) and اَرَاهِطُ, (S, ISd, K,) as though pl. of اَرْهُطٌ, (S, ISd,) though Sb makes it pl. of رَهْطٌ, because of the rareness of the pl. pl., (ISd,) and اَرَاهِيطُ [which is app. pl. of اَرْهَاطٌ]. (S, K.) You say, هُمْ رَهْطُهُ دِنْيَةً <br>\
                  <i>They are his people,</i> and <i>his tribe, closely related.</i> (S, TA.) And it is said in the Kur [xxvii. 49], وَكَانَ قِى المَدِينَةِ تِسْعَةُ رَهْطٍ, (S,) but this means, [<i>And there were in the city</i>] <i>nine persons,</i> (Bd,) or <i>nine men.</i> (Jel.) ―         -b2-  You also say رَهْطٌ مِنْ عُشَرٍ [<i>A collection of plants of the kind called</i> <br>\
                  عشر]. (IAar, Sh, TA in art. ايك.)       -A2-  <i>An enemy;</i> syn. عَدُوٌّ; (K, TA; [in the CK عَدْو;]) mentioned by Sgh, on the authority of Ibn- &#39;Abbád. (TA.)       -A3-  <i>A skin,</i> (K,) or <i>a waistwrapper</i> (اـِزَار) <i>made of leather,</i> (Jm,) <i>the sides</i> <br>\
                  <i>of which are slit in several places in their lower parts, so that one may walk in it;</i> (Jm, K;) or <i>made of skin,</i> and also <i>of wool;</i> (Aboo-Tálib the Grammarian;) or <i>a skin of Et-Táïf, slit in several places;</i> (M, TA;) or <i>a skin of a size equal to the space between the navel and the knee;</i> (S;) or <i>a skin slit into a number of thongs</i> or <i>strips;</i> (ISh, S, K;) or <i>a skin cut into a number of thongs</i> or <i>strips, these being one above another;</i> (AHeyth;) or <i>a waist-wrapper</i> (مِيْزَر) <i>made of skin,</i> or <i>leather, slit in several places, except in the place of the pudendum;</i> (TA;) or <i>a skin slit into strips, each strip being of the breadth of four fingers;</i> (IAar;) <i>worn by children,</i> (M, K,) or <i>by a young girl before she has arrived at puberty,</i> (IAar,) and <i>by a woman in menstruis:</i> (IAar, S, M, K, &amp;amp;c.:) [in Nubia, the رَهْط, still called by that name, is very neatly made, consisting of a great number of slender thongs: it is worn there by young girls, and is generally their only covering, completely surrounding and concealing the pelvic portion of the body, and the whole or part of the thighs:] in the Time of Ignorance, the men used to perform their circuitings [around the Kaabeh] naked, and the women wearing [only] the رهط: (S:) [see also حَوْفٌ, in two places:] the pl. is اَرْهَاطٌ [a pl. of pauc.] (S, TA) and رِهَاطٌ: (ISh, S, K:) or this last is a sing. also, (K,) signifying <i>a piece of leather of a size equal to the space between the place of the waist-band and the knee, slit in several places like the</i> [<i>thongs called</i>] شُرُك [<i>of the sandal,</i> pl. of شِرَاك]; <i>worn by a girl of seven years:</i> or <i>a garment worn by the boys of the Arabs of the desert, consisting of overlapping folds</i> or <i>plies, one above another, like fans:</i> (TA:) pl. اَرْهِطَةٌ [a pl. of pauc.].
