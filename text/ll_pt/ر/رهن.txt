      رَهَنَ; (K;) but the former is the more ap proved: (TA:) and also <i>he found</i> it <i>to be so.</i> (Msb.)

[And accord. to an expla nation of اُرْهِنَتْ (referring to dates), by &#39;Alee Ibn Hamzeh, cited in a marginal note in a copy of the S, in art. اَرْهَنَ، وهب signifies <i>He prepared</i> food, <i>and continued</i> it, or <i>made</i> it <i>permanent.</i>] ―         -b2-  [Hence ارهنهُ as used by some in another sense of رَهَنَهُ:] see 1, in six places.

      رِهَانٌ has a similar meaning, but is specially applied to <i>a thing that is deposited as a bet,</i> or <i>wager,</i> or <i>stake;</i> and is likewise originally an inf. n.: (Er-Rághib, TA:) ↓ <br>\
      رَهِينَةٌ, also, is <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  رَهْنٌ [as meaning the <i>act of giving as a pledge</i>], like as شَتِيمَةٌ is syn. with شَتْمٌ; the ة being added to give intensiveness to the significa tion: then, like رَهْنٌ, it is used as <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  مَرْهُونٌ [in the sense explained above, as will be seen in what follows in this paragraph]; (IAth, TA;) [i. e.] رَهِينَةٌ is an inf. n. like شَتِيمَةٌ, applied to denote the pass. part. n. [used as a subst. pro perly so termed] like رَهْنٌ, not as an epithet; (Bd in lxxiv. 41;) [or, in other words,] رَهِينَةٌ signifies <i>anything by reason of which a thing</i> [<i>such as a debt or the like</i>] <i>is restricted,</i> or <i>appro priated, to oneself;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      مُرْتَهَنَةٌ: (K: [I here follow two copies of the K, in which it is said, كُلُّ مَا اْحْتُبِسَ بِهِ شَىْءٌ فَرَهِينَةٌ وَ مُرْتَهَنَةٌ: in the CK, and in the copy of the K followed in the TA, فَرَهِينُهُ وَ مُرْتَهَنُهُ, which perverts the meaning, though ↓ <br>\
      رَهِينٌ and ↓ <br>\
      مُرْتَهَنٌ may be used in the same sense as رَهِينَةٌ and مُزْتَهَنَةٌ, as will be seen in the course of this paragraph: and in the TA, in the place of اْحْتُبِسَ, is put يحبس, meaning يُحْبَسُ: there is, however, this difference between ↓ <br>\
      رَهِينَةٌ and ↓ <br>\
      مُرْتَهَنَةٌ; that the former properly signifies <i>a thing deposited as a pledge;</i> and the latter, <i>a thing taken,</i> or <i>received, as a pledge:</i>]) the pl. of رَهْنٌ is رِهَانٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and رُهُونٌ (Mgh, Msb, K) and رُهُنٌ, (Mgh, K,) this last said to be a pl. of رَهْنٌ by Aboo-&#39; Amr Ibn-El-&#39; Alà, but disap proved by Akh, because a word of the measure فَعْلٌ has not a pl. of the measure فُعُلٌ except in rare and anomalous instances, though he says that it may be [as it is said to be in the Msb] pl. of رِهَانٌ, which is pl. of رَهْنٌ, (S,) and Fr says that رُهُنٌ is pl. of رِهَانٌ, but this is denied in the M, because any pl. may not be pluralized except when there is express authority for it and when the case does not admit of any other decision; (TA;) and رُهْنٌ, also, is another pl. of رَهْنٌ, (TA,) [or rather it is a contraction of رُهُنٌ;] and another pl. of رَهْنٌ [or rather a quasi-pl. n.] is ↓ <br>\
      رَهِينٌ, (IJ, K,) like as عَبِيدٌ is of عَبْدٌ: (TA:) the pl. of ↓ <br>\

                  بِمَا فِيهِ. [<i>The pledge became,</i> or <i>has become, per manent as a possession, with what was,</i> or <i>is, comprised in it,</i>] is a prov., applied to him who has fallen into a case from which he cannot hope to escape: it is said in a trad., لَا يَغْلَقُِ الرَّهْنُ, (Meyd,) [i. e. <i>The pledge shall not remain,</i> or <i>let not the pledge remain, in the hand of its receiver when its depositer is able to release it;</i> for] لا is here either negative or prohibitive: you say, غَلِقَ الرَّهْنُ, aor. يَغْلَقُ, inf. n. غُلُوقٌ [or غَلَقٌ], meaning <i>The pledge remained in the hand of the receiver when the depositor was able to release it:</i> (Nh, cited in a copy of the “ Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer: ”) the trad. means that the receiver of the pledge shall not have a right to it when the depositer has not released it within a certain time: for it was a custom in the Time of Ignorance for the receiver to keep possession of the pledge in this case; but El-Islám abolished it. (Meyd, * Nh.) You say also, هُوَ رَهْنٌ بِكَذَا and بكذا ↓ <br>\

      رِجْلُهُ رَهِينَةٌ [<i>His leg,</i> or <i>foot, is a pledge for</i> the safe-keeping of <i>his shackle:</i> for if the meaning were مَرْهُونَةٌ it would be رَهِينٌ, without ة]. (TA.) And الخَلْقُ <br>\

                  رَهْنٌ [<i>My hand is a pledge to thee</i>]; by which is meant responsibility, or suretiship. (TA.) And قَبْرٍ ↓ <br>\
      اـِنَّهُ لَرَهِينُ [<i>Verily he is the pledge of a grave,</i> which will render him up on the day of resurrection]. (TA.) It is said in the Kur lxxiv. 41, ↓ <br>\
      كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ, meaning [<i>Every soul is a thing</i>] <i>pledged with God</i> [<i>for what it shall have wrought;</i> its works being regarded as a debt, for which it will be either released or held in custody to be punished everlastingly]: رهينة being an inf. n. like شَتِيمَةٌ applied to denote the pass. part. n. [in a manner before mentioned] like رَهْنٌ; for if it were an epithet [i. e. used in the proper sense of a pass. part. n.] the word would be رَهِينٌ. (Bd.) And in lii. 21 of the same, كُلُّ ↓ <br>\
      اْمْرِيٍ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهِينٌ, i. e. [<i>Every man is</i>] <i>pledged</i> (مَرْهُونٌ, Bd, Jel) with God (عِنْدَ اْللّٰهِ) <i>for what he shall have wrought;</i> so that if he have done good, He will release him; but other wise, He will destroy [or hold in confinement and punish] him; (Bd;) or to be punished for evil, and recompensed for good. (Jel.) And it is said in a trad., بِعَقِيقَتِهِ ↓ <br>\
      كُلُّ غُلَامٍ رَهِينَةٌ [<i>Every boy</i> that is born <i>is a pledge for his</i> <br>\
                  عقيقة, i. e. for the victim that is to be sacrificed for him when his head is shaven the first time; which is com monly regarded as his ransom from the fire of Hell]: i. e., the عقيقة is absolutely necessary for him; wherefore he is likened, when not released from it, to a pledge in the hand of the receiver: El-Khattábee says that the best explanation of it is that of Ahmad Ibn-Hambal; that if the عقيقة be not sacrificed for the boy and he die an infant, he will not intercede for his parents.
