      اَرْفَاَهَا: (S, TA:) or both signify <i>he brought the ship near to the bank of a river and made her still,</i> or <i>motionless:</i> (Mgh:) or the latter, <i>he brought her near to the land;</i> or <i>to the part of the land that was near;</i> or so the former accord. to AZ; (T;) and so the latter: but in the K, ارفا is expl. as signifying simply <i>he made,</i> or <i>drew,</i> or <i>brought, near.</i> (TA.) ↓ <br>\

                  اـِلَى جَزِيرَةٍ occurs in a trad. [as meaning <i>They brought</i> the ship <i>near to an island</i>]: and some say اَرْفَيْتُ for اَرْفَاْتُ; which latter is the original. (TA.) ―         -b2-  [Hence, accord. to ISd in the M, but this I think doubtful,] رَفَاَ الثَّوْبَ, (AZ, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. as above, (AZ, T, S, Mgh, Msb,) and so the inf. n., (AZ, T, S, Mgh,) <i>He repaired,</i> or <i>mended,</i> [or <i>darned,</i>] <i>the garment,</i> (S, Msb,) <i>where it was rent;</i> (S;) or <i>he closed up what was rent in the garment, drawing the parts together,</i> (M, Mgh, K,) by <i>texture</i> [<i>with the needle,</i> i. e. <i>darning</i>]: (Mgh:) and sometimes it is pronounced without ء; (S;) [i. e.,] one says also [رَفَا الثَّوْبَ, and] رَفَوْتُهُ, aor.      <br>\

                  , inf. n. رَفْىٌ, which is of the dial. of Benoo-Kaab; (Msb;) but this last is strange. (TA.) [See 1 in art. رفو.] One says, مَنِ ا=غْتَابَ خَرَقَ وَمَنِ اْسْتَغْفَرَ رَفَاَ (tropical:)  [<i>He who traduces another, behind his back or otherwise, though with truth, rends, and he who begs forgiveness repairs</i>]: (S, M:) i. e., by الاِغْتِيَاب he rends his religion, and by الاِسْتِغْفَار he repairs it.

      ارفاهُ signifies دَارَاهُ [<i>he treated him with gentleness,</i> or <i>blandishment; soothed, coaxed, wheedled,</i> or <i>cajoled, him;</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (IAar, M:) or ارفا is also syn. with دَارَى; and so is رافا. (K.)    </entryFree> <br>\

(Msb.) It is said, in a trad., that the Prophet forbade the use of this phrase, disliking it because it was a customary form of congratulation in the Time of Ignorance: (T, * TA:) and some relate that he used to say, in its stead, بَارَكَ اْللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ and بَارَكَ فِيكَ [May God  bless thee], and جَمَعَ بَيْنَكُمَا فِى خَيْرٍ [may He unite you two in prosperity].
