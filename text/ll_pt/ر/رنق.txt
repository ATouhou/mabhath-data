And you say also, رنّق اـِلَيْهِ النَّظُرَ and دنّق [meaning <i>He continued looking at it</i>]. (S in art. دنق.)

(S.) ―         -b5-  Said of a bird, <i>He flapped his wings in the air,</i> (S, K,) <i>and remained steady,</i> (S,) <i>not flying:</i> (S, K:) or <i>flapped his wings in the air without alighting and without quitting his place:</i> or it has two meanings: i. e. <i>he expanded his wings in the air without moving them:</i> and <i>he flapped his wings.</i> (TA.) Hence, said of a captive, <i>He stretched out his neck</i> on the occasion of slaughter, <i>like the bird expanding his wings.</i> (TA.) [Hence also,] رنّقت السَّفِينَةُ (JK, TA) فِى مَكَانِهَا (JK) <i>The ship turned round in its place without proceeding in its course.</i> (JK, TA.) ―         -b6-  رنّقت الشَّمْسُ <br>\
