                     رَبَعَ<br>\

And [hence,] رَبَعَ عَلَيْهِ, (K,) inf. n. رَبْعٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  <i>He was affectionate,</i> or <i>pitiful,</i> or <i>compassionate, towards him:</i> (K:) or <i>he acted gently towards him.</i> (TA.) And رَبَعَ عَنْهُ (K,) inf. n. رَبْعٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  <i>He restrained himself, refrained, abstained,</i> or <i>desisted, from it.</i> (K.) The phrases اِرْبَعْ عَلَى نَفْسِكَ and اربع على ظَلْعِكَ (S, K) and اربع عَلَيْكَ (K) are from رَبَعَ in the sense of “ he paused, ” &amp;amp;c., (S, K,) as explained by ISk, (S,) [or in one of the senses following that,] meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Deal thou gently with thyself; moderate thyself; restrain thyself:</i> (S, TA:) or <i>behave thou with deliberation,</i> or <i>in a leisurely manner:</i> or the second of these phrases may mean <i>continue thou notwithstanding thy slight lameness:</i> or it may be from رَبَعَ الحَجَرَ, [q. v. infrà,] meaning <i>take thou it,</i> or <i>reach it, notwithstanding thy slight lameness.</i> (TA.) The phrase اِرْبَعِى بِنَفْسِكِ, or عَلَى نَفْسِكِ, in the trad. of Subey&#39;ah El-Aslameeyeh, accord. to two different relations, admits of two interpretations: one is, (assumed tropical:)  <i>Pause thou, and wait for the completion of the</i> <br>\
                  عِدَّة [q. v.] <i>of decease;</i> and this is accord. to the persuasion of those who say that her عدّة is the more remote of the two periods, which is the persuasion of &#39;Alee and I&#39;Ab: the second is, from رَبَعَ الرّجُلُ signifying “ the man had, or obtained, abundance of herbage, ” and the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  <i>relieve thou thyself, and release thyself from the straitness of the</i> <br>\
                  عدّة, <i>and the evil of thy condition;</i> and this is accord. to the persuasion of those who hold that her عدّة is the nearer of the two periods; and hence &#39;Omar said, “ If she bring forth when her husband is on his bier, meaning, not buried, it is allowable for her to marry. ” (TA.) It is also said, in another trad., لَا يَرْبَعُ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ مَنْ <br>\
                  لَا يُحْزِنُهُ اَمْرُكَ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  <i>He will not restrain himself, and be patient with thee, whom thy case does not grieve.</i> (TA.) And it is said in a prov., حَدِّثِ اْمْرَاَةً حَدِيثَيْنِ فَاـِنْ اَبَتْ فَاْرْبَعْ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  <i>Speak thou to a woman twice; and if she refuse, abstain thou:</i> or, accord. to one relation, it is ↓ <br>\
      فَاَرْبِعْ: and accord. to another, فَاْرْبَعْهُ, i. e., <i>then add;</i> for she is very weak in understanding; <i>if she understand not, then make thou the two speeches to be four:</i> Aboo-Sa&#39;eed says, فَاـِنْ لَمْ تَفْهَمْ بَعْدَ الاَرْبَعَةِ فَاْلْمِرْبَعَة, i. e., [<i>and if she understand not after the four, then</i>] <i>the stick</i> [is to be used; or, <i>then</i> use thou <i>the stick</i>]: the prov. applies to the hearing and answering in an evil manner. (TA.) You say also, رَبَعَتْ عَلَى عَقْلِ فُلَانٍ وَكَسَرَ فِيهَا رِبَاعَهُ, inf. n. رِبَاعَةٌ, (tropical:)  [app. <i>She behaved in a gentle and coaxing manner so as to get the better of the reason,</i> or <i>understanding, of such a one, and he sold his houses one after another to expend upon her;</i>] i. e., <i>he expended upon her all that he possessed, so that he sold his dwellings.</i> (TA. [The و before كسر is not in the TA; but as it seems to have been dropped by inadvertence, I have supplied it.])       -A6-  رَبَعَ الفَصِيلُ <br>\

(Msb in art. جمد.) It has a twofold application also to seasons; الرَّبِيعُ الاَوَّلُ being <i>The season in which the truffles and the blossoms come,</i> (S, Msb, K,) and this is [also called] رَبِيعُ الكَلَاِ [<i>the rabeea of the herbage,</i> properly called <i>the spring of Arabia</i>]; (S;) and الرَّبِيعُ الثَّانِى <br>\

                  <i>the rabeea of the herbage</i>], because the herbage therein attains to its last stage: and he adds, that رَبِيعٌ is applied by the Arabs to the whole <i>winter,</i> [meaning, again, the <i>half-year commencing at the autumnal equinox,</i>] because of the moisture, or rain: (TA:) or <i>the year consists of six seasons;</i> (so in the K; but in the S, “ and I heard Abu-l-Ghowth say, the Arabs make the year to be six seasons; ”) <i>two months thereof are called</i> <br>\

(S, K.) Az relates, with respect to the seasons and divisions of the year, on the authority of Aboo-Yahyà Ibn-Kibáseh, who possessed very great knowledge thereof, that the year consists of four seasons; namely, الرَّبِيعُ الاَوَّلُ, which the vulgar call الخَرِيفُ [<i>The autumn</i>]; then الشِّتَا=ءُ [<i>the winter</i>]; then الصَّيْفُ, which is الرَّبِيعُ الا=خِرُ [or الثَّانِى, i. e. <i>the spring</i>]; then القَيْظُ [<i>the summer,</i> or <i>hot season</i>]: all this is what the Arabs in the desert say: <i>the</i> <br>\

(TA.) The pl. of ربيع is اَرْبِعَةٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and اَرْبِعَا=ءُ [a pl. of mult.] (S, Msb, K) and رِبَاعٌ; (AHn, K;) or the first of these is pl. of ربيع الكلا (Fr, Yaakoob, S, Msb, K) and of the ربيع of the months; (Fr, Msb;) but the second is pl. of ربيع in the sense of جَدْوَلٌ, to be explained below. (Fr, Yaakoob, S, Msb, K.) Hence the phrase in a supplication, mentioned in a trad., اَللّٰهُمَّ اْجْعَلِ القُرْا=نَ رَبِيعَ قَلْبِى [<i>O God, make Thou the Kur-án to be the life,</i> or <i>ease, of my heart</i>]; because the heart of man becomes lively, or at ease, in the season called رَبِيع.
