                  , aor. اَرْجُوهُ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. رَجْوٌ, (S, M, K,) or رُجُوٌّ, (Msb,) and رَجَا=ءٌ, (S, K, TA, &amp;amp;c., [in the CK erroneously written with the short ا i. e., without the meddeh and ء,]) or the latter is a simple subst., (Msb,) and رَجَاوَةٌ (S, K) and رَجَاةٌ, or رَجَا=ءَةٌ, (accord. to different copies of the K,) or both, (CK,) and مَرْجَاةٌ; (K;) and ↓ <br>\
      رَجَّيْتُهُ, (S,) inf. n. تَرْجِيَةٌ; (K;) and ↓ <br>\
      تَرَجَّيْتُهُ, (S, K, *) and ↓ <br>\
      اِرْتَجَيْتُهُ; (S, Msb, K; *) <i>I hoped for him</i> [or <i>it;</i> relating only to what is possible; <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  اَمَلْتُهُ; see رَجَا=ءٌ, below]; all signify the same: (S:) and رَجَيْتُهُ, aor. اَرْجِيهِ, is a dial. var. of رَجَوْتُهُ: (Msb:) and رَجِيَهُ, aor. يَرْجَاهُ, like رَضِيَهُ, is a dial. var. of رَجَاهُ, aor. يَرْجُوهُ, accord. to Lth: it is disapproved by Az, because heard by him on no other authority than that of Lth; but it is mentioned also by ISd. (TA.) One says, مَا اَتَيْتُكَ اـِلَّا رَجَاوَةَ الخَيْرِ [<i>I did not,</i> or <i>have not, come to thee except hoping for that which is good</i>]. (S.) No regard is to be paid to the assertion of Lth, that the saying فَعَلْتُ رَجَاةَ كَذَا [<i>I did</i> a thing <i>hoping for such a thing</i>] is a mistake, and that the correct word is only رَجَا=ءَ; for رَجَاةٌ occurs in a trad., and in the poetry of the Arabs. (TA.) ―         -b2-  Sometimes رَجْوٌ, (S,) or رُجُوٌّ, (Msb,) has the meaning of خَوْفٌ; (S, Msb;) because the hoper fears that he may not attain the thing for which he hopes; (Msb;) and so رَجَا=ءٌ; (T, S;) but only when there is with it a negative particle: (Fr, T, TA:) you say, مَا رَجَوْتُكَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>I feared not</i> <br>\
                  <i>thee:</i> but you do not say, رَجَوْتُكَ, meaning <i>I feared thee:</i> (TA:) the saying in the Kur [lxxi. 12], مَا لَكُمْ لَا تَرْجُونَ لِلّٰهِ وَقَارًا means (assumed tropical:)  [<i>What aileth you</i>] <i>that ye will not fear the greatness,</i> or <i>majesty, of God?</i> (S:) or the meaning is, <i>that ye will not hope for God&#39;s magnifying</i> of him who serves Him and obeys Him? or <i>that ye will not believe in greatness,</i> or <i>majesty, belonging to God,</i> so that ye may fear disobeying Him? (Bd:) another instance occurs in a verse of Aboo-Dhu-eyb, cited in art. خلف, conj. 3: (S:) and ↓ <br>\
      ارتجاهُ, also, signifies (tropical:)  <i>he feared him,</i> or <i>it;</i> [but app. only when preceded by a negative particle, as in exs. cited in the TA;] (K, TA;) in which sense it is tropical. (TA.) Accord. to Lth, رَجْوٌ is also syn. with مُبَالَاةٌ; and مَا اَرْجُو means مَا اُبَالِى [<i>I do not care, mind,</i> or <i>heed</i>]: but this is disapproved by Az. (TA.)       -A2-  رَجِىَ <br>\
                  <i>He broke off,</i> or <i>ceased,</i> [app. <i>by reason of inability,</i>] <i>from speaking:</i> (K:) or, accord. to Az, <i>he became confounded,</i> or <i>perplexed, and unable to see his right course:</i> or, as Fr says, <i>he desired to speak, and was unable to do so:</i> (TA:) and رُجِىَ عَلَيْهِ, like عُنِىَ, <i>he became unable to speak.</i> (K.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>She</i> (a camel, S, or a pregnant female [of any kind], TA) <i>was,</i> or <i>became, near to bringing forth;</i> (S, K, TA;) <i>so that her bringing forth was hoped for:</i> accord. to Er-Rághib, the proper signification is <i>she made her owner to have hope in himself that her bringing forth was near:</i> (TA:) and اَرْجَاَتْ means the same. (S.) ―         -b2-  ارجى الصَّيْدَ <br>\
                  <i>He failed of getting any game;</i> (K;) [as though he made the game to have hope;] and ارجاهُ signifies the same: (TA:) or so ارجى [alone], and ارجا [alone]. (K and TA in art. رجا.)       -A2-  And اَرْجَيْتُهُ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. اـِرْجَا=ءٌ, (K,) <i>I postponed it, put it off, deferred it,</i> or <i>delayed it;</i> (S, Msb, K; *) namely, an affair [&amp;amp;c.]; (S;) as also ارجاتهُ.

<b>رَجًا</b>               1     <br>\

                   The <i>side,</i> (K,) in a general sense: (TA:) or the <i>side</i> of a well, (S, Msb, K,) and of the sky, (Er-Rághib, TA,) and of anything; (S, Msb; *) and ↓ <br>\
      رَجَا=ءٌ signifies the same: (K:) the <i>side</i> of a well <i>from its top to its bottom;</i> (TA;) and the <i>two sides thereof:</i> which last is also [or properly] the meaning of the dual; which is رَجَوَانِ: (S:) pl. اَرْجَا=ءٌ. (S, Msb, K.) Hence, in the Kur [lxix. 17], وَاْلْمَلَكُ عَلَى اَرْجَايِهَا [<i>The angels being at the sides thereof</i>]. (S, TA.) They said, رُمِىَ بِهِ الرَّجَوَانِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>He was cast into places of destruction:</i> (S:) or it is said of one who is held in mean estimation: (M, TA:) اِسْتِهْزَا=ءٌ in the K is a mistake for اُسْتُهِينَ بِهِ, the reading in the M: (TA:) as though the two [opposite] sides of the well were cast at with him. (K.) And one says of him who will not be deceived so as to be turned away from one course to another, لَا تُرْمَى بِهِ الرَّجَوَانِ (assumed tropical:)  [lit. <i>The two sides</i> of the well <i>will not be cast at with him</i>]; in allusion to the well&#39;s two [opposite] sides&#39; being cast at with the bucket.

                   [accord. to most an inf. n., (see 1, in two senses,) but accord. to the Msb a simple subst.,] <i>Hope;</i> syn. اَمَلٌ; (S and M and K in art امل;) <i>contr. of</i> <br>\

                  اَمَلٌ: and conventionally, the <i>clinging of the heart to the happening of a future loved event:</i> (TA:) or <i>hope,</i> or <i>eager desire, for a thing that may possibly happen;</i> differing from تَمَنٍّ, which relates to what is possible and to what is impossible.
