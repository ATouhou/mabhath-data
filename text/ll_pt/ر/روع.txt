Hence the saying, in a trad., اـِذَا شَمِطَ لاـِنْسَانُ فِى عَارِضَيْهِ <br>\
                  فَذٰلِكَ الرَّوْعُ, as though meaning [<i>When the man becomes grizzled in the hair of the two sides of his face, that is</i>] <i>the warning of death.</i> (TA.)

[But I know of no authority on which this is founded, except a prov. (cited in art. جعر) , in which some read رُوعِى جَعَارِ instead of رُوغِى.]) To a man, you say, لَا تُرَعْ [<i>Be not thou frightened;</i>] <i>fear not thou; let not fear overtake thee:</i> and to a woman, لَا تُرَاعِى. (S, TA.) And hence the saying, in a trad., لَنْ تُرَاعَوْا مَا رَاَيْنَا مِنْ شَىْءٍ [<i>Ye shall not be frightened,</i> or <i>afraid: we saw not,</i> or <i>have not seen, anything</i>]. (TA.)

And خَرَجْتُ وَ مَا رَاعَنِى اـِلَّا فُلَانٌ لِالبَابِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>I went forth, and nothing took me by surprise but such a one at the door</i>]; which is equivalent to saying, <i>and lo, such a one was at the door.</i> (Har p. 207.) And it is said in a trad. of I&#39;Ab, فَلَمْ يَرُعْنِى اـِلَّا <br>\

                  <i>And what is upon him, of apparel, excites his admiration</i> &amp;amp;c., by its beauty. (TA.) ―         -b4-  [<i>It</i> (drink) <i>cooled it,</i> (namely, the heart,) or <i>allayed its thirst.</i>] A poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>She gave me to drink a draught that cooled,</i> or <i>allayed the thirst of, my heart: may God give her to drink from the pool of the Apostle</i> in Paradise]. (TA.) You say also, هٰذِهِ شَرْبَةٌ رَاعَ <br>\
                  بِهَا فُوَادِى [which may be rendered <i>This is a draught by which he has cooled,</i> or <i>allayed the thirst of, my heart;</i> and it is implied in the TA that this is the right meaning: or it means] <i>this is a draught by which the thirst,</i> or <i>vehement thirst, of my heart has been allayed:</i> (so accord. to the pointing in the copies of the K:) mentioned by Az. (TA.)       -A2-  The verb from رَوَعٌ [q. v. infrà] is one and the same [whether trans. or intrans.; i. e., you say رَاعَهُ, aor. يَرُوعُ, inf. n. رَوْعٌ, meaning “He,” or “it, excited his admiration and approval,” &amp;amp;c., as expl. above; and رَاعَ, app. with the same aor. and inf. n., meaning <i>He possessed the quality of exciting admiration and approval by his beauty and the pleasingness of his aspect,</i> or <i>by his courage,</i> &amp;amp;c.; and in like manner, رَاعَتْ, said of a woman]; the trans. verb [in this case] being like the trans. [in other cases], and the intrans. [in this case] like the intrans. [in other cases]: but the regular form, accord. to Az, of the [intrans.] verb hence derived is رَوِعَ, aor. يَرْوَعُ, inf. n. رَوَعٌ. (TA.)       -A3-  رَاعَ فِى يَدِى <br>\

                   [see 1, of which it is an inf. n. ―         -b2- ] <i>Fright,</i> or <i>fear;</i> (S, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      رَوعٌ [accord. to some, but this seems to be little known]. (TA.) Hence the saying, اَفْرَخَ رَوْعُهُ <br>\
                  <i>His fright,</i> or <i>fear, departed.</i> (S.) Az says, All the lexicologists whom I have met say اَفْرَخَ رَوْعُهُ, with fet-h to the ر [in روعه], except El-Mundhiree, who informs me that AHeyth used to say, It is only ↓ <br>\
      افرخ رَوْعُكَ, with damm. (TA.) Accord. to different relations of a trad., you say, ↓ <br>\
      اَفْرَخَ رُوعُكَ, meaning <i>Fright,</i> or <i>fear, hath departed from thy heart;</i> or <i>may fright,</i> or <i>fear, depart from thy heart;</i> (K, TA;) thus expl. by AHeyth; (TA;) and افرخ رَوْعُكَ, with fet-h; or this latter, only, is the right, and means <i>what thou fearest hath quitted thee, and departed from thee, and become removed;</i> or <i>may what thou fearest quit thee,</i> &amp;amp;c.; as though it were taken from the young bird&#39;s going forth from the egg, (K, TA,) and the darkness&#39; becoming removed from it; thus expl. by Aboo-Ahmad El-Hasan Ibn-&#39; Abd-Allah Ibn-Sa&#39;eed El-&#39; Askeree; and AO says that افرخ روعك [thus in the TA, without any syll. signs,] means <i>let thy fright,</i> or <i>fear, depart,</i> for the case is not as thou fearest it to be. (TA.) It is also said, in a trad. of Mo&#39;áwiyeh, that he wrote in a letter to Ziyád, ↓ <br>\
      لِيُفْرِخْ رُوعُكَ, with damm; (K, TA;) but the opinion commonly obtaining with the leading lexicologists is, that it is with fet-h; except AHeyth, who relates it thus, with damm; (TA;) meaning <i>Dismiss thou the</i> <br>\
                  رَوْع <br>\
                  <i>from thy</i> <br>\
                  رُوع; (K, TA;) i. e., <i>the fright,</i> or <i>fear, from thy heart:</i> (TA:) for you say اَفْرَخَتِ البَيْضَةُ when the young bird quits the egg; and رَوْع is <i>fright,</i> or <i>fear,</i> which does not depart from itself, but from its place, which is the رُوع, with damm; (AHeyth, K;) the رَوْع in the رُوع being like the young bird in the egg: in like manner also one says اَفْرَخَ فُوَادُ الرَّجُلِ when a man&#39;s fright, or fear, departs: but Dhu-r-Rummeh, though knowing the meaning, has made an inversion, saying, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        قَدْ اَفْرَخَتْ عَنْ رُوعِهِ الكُرَبُ<br>\
                  </quote> [for قَدْ اَفْرَخَ عَنِ الكُرَبِ رُوعُهُ <br>\
                  <i>His heart had freed itself from griefs</i>]. (AHeyth, TA.) AHeyth adds, (TA,) one also says, عَنِ الاَمْرِ ↓ <br>\
      اَفْرِخَ رُوعَكَ, or عَلَى الاَمْرِ, [accord. to different copies of the K, the latter being the reading in the TA, but the former probably the right,] meaning [<i>Free thy heart from the affair;</i> i. e.] <i>be thou tranquil, and without fear.</i> (K, TA.) Az observes, What AHeyth says is clear; but I am averse from it because of his being alone in his saying; though sometimes later authorities correct things in which the earlier have erred; therefore the correctness of AHeyth may not be [absolutely] denied in this matter, seeing that he had an ample share of knowledge. (TA.) [See also art. فرخ, in several places.] ―         -b3-  Also (tropical:)  <i>War,</i> or <i>battle;</i> as in the phrase, شَهِدَ الرَّوْعَ (tropical:) [<i>He witnessed,</i> or <i>was present at</i> or <i>in, war,</i> or <i>battle</i>].

                  <i>That came into my mind.</i> (S, Msb, * TA.) And it is said in a trad., اـِنَّ الرُّوحَ نَفَثَ فِى رُوعِى [<i>Verily the Trusted,</i> or <i>Trusty, Spirit</i> (meaning <i>Gabriel</i>) <i>inspired into my mind,</i> or <i>heart</i>]. (S.)
