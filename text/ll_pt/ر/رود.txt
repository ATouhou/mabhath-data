                  جِدَارًا يُرِيدُ اَنْ يَنْقَضَّ, in the Kur xviii. 78, means (tropical:)  [<i>And they found therein a wall</i>] <i>that was near,</i> or <i>about, to fall down,</i> (Bd, Jel,) or <i>that was ready to fall down;</i> though الاـِرَادَة is only from an animate being, and not properly predicable of a wall: and there are many similar instances; as the saying of a poet, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

      رُوَيْدٌ. (S, A, K. [But see what follows.]) They said ↓ <br>\

                  <i>Walk thou,</i> or <i>go thou, gently,</i> &amp;amp;c.: (T, A:) so accord. to the lexicologists [in general]: but accord. to Sb, it is a verbal n.: [for] they said, زَيْدًا ↓ <br>\
      رُوَيْدَ, meaning <i>Act thou gently, softly,</i> or <i>in a leisurely manner, towards,</i> or <i>with, Zeyd;</i> or <i>grant him a delay,</i> or <i>respite; let him alone,</i> or <i>leave him, for a while;</i> syn. اَمْهِلْهُ: hence it has no dual nor pl. nor fem. form: and hence they say that it is for اـِرْوَادًا, in the sense of اَرْوِدْ; as though it were an abbreviated dim., formed by the rejection of the augmentative letters: this is the opinion of Sb; for he holds it to be a substitute for اَرْوِدْ; though it has a nearer resemblance to اـِرْوَادٌ because it is a noun: others hold it to be the dim. of رُودٌ, and cite the saying [of a poet], <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

      رُوَيْد seems to have two contr. significations; for they said, رُوَيْدَ زَيْدًا, meaning <i>Leave thou Zeyd,</i> or <i>let him alone;</i> and also meaning <i>act thou gently towards,</i> or <i>with, Zeyd, and retain him,</i> or <i>withhold him.</i> (TA.) One says also, عَمْرًا ↓ <br>\
      رُوَيْدَكَ, meaning <i>Act thou gently,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>towards,</i> or <i>with, &#39;Amr;</i> syn. اَمْهِلْهُ: (T, * S, M, * K:) the ك in this case being a denotative of allocution, (T, S, M,) and having no place in the desinential syntax: (S, M: *) it is added only when رويد is used in the sense of an imperative; (T, S, K;) and to prevent confusion of him who is meant to be addressed with him who is not meant, because رويد applies to one and to more than one and to the male and to the female; though sometimes one says رويدك to a person when one does not fear his being confounded with another, using the ك as a corroborative. (T.) In this case, ↓ <br>\
      رويد is an abbreviated dim. of اـِرْوَاد, the inf. n. of اَرْوَدَ. (S.) In like manner also one says, (K, TA,) to a male, (TA,) ↓ <br>\

      رُوَيْدَكُنَّنِى (K, TA) to females more than two. (TA.) ↓ <br>\
      رُوَيْد is used in four different manners: first, as a verbal n.; as in عَمْرًا ↓ <br>\
      رُوَيْدَ, (S, K, *) i. e. اَرْوِدْ عَمْرًا, (S,) meaning اَمْهِلْهُ [expl. above]: (S, K:) secondly, as an inf. n.; as in عَمْرٍو ↓ <br>\
      رُوَيْدَ [virtually meaning the same]; the former word being prefixed to the latter, governing it in the gen. case; (S, M, * K; *) like فَضَرْبَ الرِّقَابِ, in the Kur [xlvii. 4], (S, M, *) in which the inf. n. is put for its verb; (Jel;) and like عَذِيرَ الحَىِّ [expl. in art. عذر]: (M:) thirdly, as an epithet; as in ↓ <br>\
      سَارُوا سَيْرًا رُوَيْدًا [<i>They went,</i> or <i>journeyed, at a gentle,</i> or <i>leisurely, rate of going,</i> or <i>journeying</i>]; (Sb, S, K;) and سَارُوا ↓ <br>\
      رُوَيْدًا, in which سَيْرًا is suppressed: (T:) fourthly, as a denotative of state; as in ↓ <br>\
      سَارَ القَوْمُ رُوَيْدًا [<i>The people,</i> or <i>party, went,</i> or <i>journeyed, going,</i> or <i>journeying, gently,</i> or <i>leisurely</i>]; it being here in connection with a determinate noun, and therefore a denotative of its state. (S, K.) When it is used as a threat, it is with nasb, without tenween; (Lth, T, M; *) as in the saying of a poet, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
