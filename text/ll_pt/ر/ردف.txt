      اردفهُ; (AZ, Sh, T, M;) said by IAar to signify the same as رَدِفَهُ: (T:) [or, in other words,] رَدِفَهُ signifies <i>he became to him a</i> <br>\
                  رِدْف [meaning <i>a</i> <br>\
                  رَدِيف]; and so رَدِفَ لَهُ; for the Arabs often add the ل with a trans. v. that governs an accus. noun; so that they say, سَمِعَ لَهُ and شَكَرَ لَهُ and نَصَحَ لَهُ, meaning سَمِعَهُ and شَكَرَهُ and نَصَحَهُ: (Fr, T:) [and also] <i>he,</i> or <i>it, followed,</i> or <i>came after, him,</i> or <i>it;</i> (S, O, K, and Ham p. 148;) and so رَدِفَ لَهُ; (Ham ibid.;) and رَدَفَهُ, aor.      <br>\

      اردفهُ being like تَبِعَهُ and اَتْبَعَهُ in [form and] meaning: (S:) [↓ <br>\
      رَدَّفَهُ, likewise, appears to be syn. with رَدِفَهُ; or, probably, رُدِّفَهُ, which seems to signify lit. <i>he was made to ride behind him;</i> &amp;amp;c.; for it is said that] the inf. n. تَرْدِيفٌ signifies the <i>coming,</i> or <i>going, behind;</i> as also تَرْدَافٌ: (KL:) and رَدِفْتُهُ also signifies <i>I overtook him and outwent him.</i> (Msb: [explained in my copy by لحقته وسبقته: but I think that سبقته is a mistranscription for تَبِعْتُهُ; and that the meaning therefore is, <i>I overtook him and followed him.</i>]) One says, كَانَ نَزَلَ <br>\

      اردفهُ is a dial. var. of رَدِفَهُ, meaning <i>An event happened to him afterwards:</i> (S, O:) or رَدِفَهُمُ الاَمْرُ and ↓ <br>\
      اَرْدَفَهُم signify <i>the event came upon them suddenly,</i> or <i>unexpectedly;</i> or <i>came upon them so as to overwhelm them.</i> (M.) It is said in the Kur [xxvii. 74], عَسَى اَنْ <br>\
                  يَكُونَ رَدِفَ لَكُمْ بَعْضُ اْلَّذِى تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ, meaning [<i>Perhaps a portion of that which ye desire to hasten</i>] <i>may have drawn near to you;</i> (Yoo, Fr, T, O,) as though the ل were introduced because the meaning is دَنَا لَكُمْ: or it may mean يَكُونَ <br>\
                  رَدِفَكُمْ [may <i>have become close behind you</i>]; (Fr, T, O;) the ل being introduced for a reason mentioned above, as in سَمِعَ لَهُ &amp;amp;c. for سَمِعَهُ &amp;amp;c.: (Fr, T:) El-Aaraj read رَدَفَ لكم.
