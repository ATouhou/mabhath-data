IAar used to say, in relation [or reply] to the saying مَا رِمْتُ [<i>I did not go away,</i> &amp;amp;c., or <i>I have not gone away,</i> &amp;amp;c.], بَلَى قَدْ رِمْتُ [<i>Nay, I did go away,</i> &amp;amp;c., or <i>I have gone away,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: but others use the verb only with a negative particle: (T:) or it is mostly used in negative phrases.
