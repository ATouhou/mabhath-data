                  يَخْتَصِمُونَ], <i>and the like thereof:</i> no regard should be paid to the saying of Fr, that in this [last] and the like instances a letter [which in this instance and in the next preceding it is ت] is incorporated into another [following it]; for they [i. e. the Arabs] do not realize this mode [of incorporation]; and he who combines two quiescent letters in an instance in which the slurring of the vowel-sound (اِخْتِلَاسُ الحَرَكَةِ) is not proper errs; as in the reading of Hamzeh, in the Kur [xviii. 96], فَمَا اْسطَّاعُوا; for the س of الاِسْتِفْعَالُ may not be made movent in any manner [and therefore it may not be incorporated into the following letter]. (S, TA.) الرَّوْمُ is [also] in a case of pausing after a word ending with any letter except the fem. ة, [in like manner] meaning <i>The indicating the vowel with an obscure sound:</i> (I&#39; Ak p. 351:) رَوْمُ الحَرَكَةِ in pausing after a word that is مَرْفُوع or مَجْرُور is from رَامَ الشَّىْءَ signifying طَلَبَهُ: Sb says that those of whom one says رَامُوا الحَرَكَةَ [<i>They slurred the vowel-sound</i>] are induced to do what this signifies [instead of suppressing the vowel-sound entirely] by eagerness to exclude it from the case of that which is necessarily made quiescent in every instance, and to show that its case is, in their opinion, not like the case of that which is made quiescent in every instance.
