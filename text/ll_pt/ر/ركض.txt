Hence, (S, A, K,) the phrase in the Kur [xxxviii. 41], (S,) اُرْكُضْ بِرِجْلِكَ [<i>Strike thou</i> the ground <i>with thy foot</i>]: (S, A, K:) or <i>strike thou, and tread,</i> the ground <i>with thy foot.</i> (Sgh.) You say also, رَكَضَ الرَّجُلُ (tropical:)  <i>The man struck the ground with his foot:</i> and رَكَضَتِ الخَيْلُ (tropical:)  <i>The horses struck the ground with their hoofs:</i> and جَا=ءَتِ <br>\
                  الخَيْلُ رَكْضًا (tropical:)  [<i>The horses came striking the ground with their hoofs</i>]: and رَكَضَتِ الجُنْدَبُ الرَّمْضَا=ءَ <br>\

                  <i>struck the vehemently-hot ground with their two legs</i>]: and تَرَكْتُهُ يَرْكُضُ بِرِجْلِهِ لِلْمَوْتِ (tropical:)  [<i>I left him striking the ground with his foot previously to death:</i> see also 8]. (A.) [The above-mentioned phrases marked as tropical are so marked on the authority of the A: but the reason of their being so I do not see.] ―         -b2-  They also said, sometimes, رَكَضَ <br>\
                  الطَّايِرُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>The bird moved his wings in flying:</i> (S:) the inf. n., رَكْضٌ, signifying (tropical:)  the act of <i>moving the wing:</i> (K, TA:) and الطَّايرُ <br>\
                  يَرْكُضُ بِجَنَاحَيْهِ (tropical:)  <i>The bird moves his wings, and puts them back against his body:</i> (A, TA:) or the former of these two phrases means (assumed tropical:)  <i>the bird was quick,</i> or <i>swift, in his flying.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  رَكْضٌ also signifies The act of <i>impelling;</i> syn. دَفْعٌ: and the <i>urging</i> a horse <i>to run,</i> (A, K, TA,) [<i>by striking</i>] <i>with his foot</i> or <i>leg:</i> (TA:) the <i>striking</i> a beast <i>with one&#39;s feet</i> or <i>legs, to urge him:</i> (Mgh:) or <i>putting</i> him <i>in motion, whether he go on or not.</i> (As.) You say, رَكَضْتُ الفَرَسَ بِرِجْلِى <br>\
                  <i>I urged the horse to run, with my foot</i> or <i>leg.</i> (S, O, Msb. *) And رَكَضَ الدَّابَّةَ, aor.      <br>\
                     رَكُضَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. رَكْضٌ, <i>He struck the sides of the beast with his foot</i> or <i>leg.</i> (TA.) And رَكَضَ الدَّابَّةَ بِرِجْلٍ, and بِرِجْلَيْنِ, <i>He struck the beast to urge it with a foot</i> or <i>leg,</i> and <i>with two feet</i> or <i>legs.</i> (A.) ―         -b4-  And from frequency of usage of the phrase رَكَضْتُ الفَرَسَ, originated the saying رَكَضَ الفَرَسُ, (AZ, * S, Mgh, Msb,) meaning (tropical:)  <i>The horse ran:</i> (S, Mgh: *) which some disallow; but without reason, since it has been transmitted by a good authority: (Msb:) it is disallowed by As: (TA:) [and J says,] the correct phrase is رُكِضَ الفَرَسُ: (S:) or you say, رُكِضَ الفَرَسُ فَرَكَضَ هُوَ, meaning [<i>The horse was urged to run,</i>] (assumed tropical:)  <i>and he ran:</i> (K:) and رَكْضٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  the act of <i>running:</i> (K, in another place in this art.:) and (assumed tropical:)  the act of <i>fleeing:</i> whence, [in the Kur xxi. 12], اـِذَا هُمْ مِنْهَا يَرْكُضُونَ (K) (assumed tropical:)  <i>lo, they fled from it,</i> from punishment: (Zj:) or (assumed tropical:)  <i>were routed, and fled from it:</i> (Fr:) or <i>they ran from it:</i> (Mgh:) [for] رَكَضَ الرَّجُلُ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The man <i>fled,</i> and (assumed tropical:)  <i>ran.</i> (ISh.) [Hence,] رَكَضَتِ النُّجُومُ فِى السَّمَا=ءِ (tropical:)  <i>The stars moved along in the sky.</i> (A, TA.) [And hence,] رَكْضٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A man&#39;s <i>going along by both his legs together.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  You also say, رَكَضَهُ البَعِيرُ (S, A, Msb) (tropical:)  <i>The camel struck him with his kind leg:</i> (S, Msb:) like as you say, رَمَحَهُ الفَرَسُ: (A, Msb: *) but you should not say, [when a camel is the agent,] رَمَحَهُ. (Yaakoob, S.) And رَكَضَ الاَرْضَ, and الثَّوْبَ, (assumed tropical:)  <i>He struck the ground,</i> and <i>the garment,</i> or <i>piece of cloth, with his foot</i> or <i>leg.</i> (TA.) And المَرْاَةُ تَرْكُضُ ذُيُولَهَا وَخَلْخَالَهَا <br>\
