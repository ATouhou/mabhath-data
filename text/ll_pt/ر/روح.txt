(L.) [It is also said that] رَوَاحٌ and رَوَاحَةٌ and رَاحَةٌ and رَوْحَةٌ and رَوِيحَةٌ [all app. inf. ns. of رَاحَ, or some of them may be simple substs.,] and مُرَايَحَةٌ [as though inf. n. of ↓ <br>\
      رَايَحَ] (L, K) signify (assumed tropical:)  The <i>experiencing relief from grief</i> or <i>sorrow, after suffering therefrom:</i> (L:) or the <i>experiencing the joy,</i> or <i>happiness, arising from certainty.</i> (K. [See also رَوْحٌ, below.]) You say also, اـِلَى حَدِيثِهِ ↓ <br>\

      بِهِ بَلِيَّةٌ فَاْرْتَاحَ (tropical:)  [<i>A trial,</i> or <i>an affliction, befell him, and God was active and prompt with his mercy, and delivered him from it</i>]: (T:) but ISd disapproves of thus speaking of God; and El-Fárisee says that it is an instance of the rudeness of speech characteristic of Arabs of the desert. (TA.) [Hence seems to have originated, as is app. implied in the TA, the assertion that] ↓ <br>\
      الاِرْتِيَاحُ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The <i>being merciful:</i> and اْللّٰهُ لَهُ بِرَحْمَتِهِ ↓ <br>\
      ارتاح, (assumed tropical:)  <i>God delivered him from trial,</i> or <i>affliction:</i> (K:) or اْللّٰهُ لِفُلَانٍ ↓ <br>\
      ارتاح (assumed tropical:)  <i>God was merciful to such a one.</i> (S.) One also says, راحت يَدُهُ لِكَذَا, (K,) or بِكَذَا, (S L,) (tropical:)  <i>His hand was active, prompt,</i> or <i>quick,</i> (S, L, K, TA,) <i>to do such a thing,</i> (K, TA,) or <i>with such a thing;</i> (S, L, TA;) as, for instance, with a sword, to strike with it. (L.) Hence the saying of the Prophet, مَنْ رَاحَ <br>\

(K, * TA.) [See also what follows.] ―         -b5-  رَاحَ, aor. يَرُوحُ, inf. n. رَوَاحٌ; and ↓ <br>\

      تَرَوَّحْ or تَرَوَّحُوا as meaning <i>Go,</i> or <i>journey:</i> (TA:) but رَاحَتِ الاـِبِلُ, (S, L, K,) aor. تَرُوحُ and تَرَاحُ, inf. n. رَوَاحٌ (L) and رَايِحَةٌ, (AZ, L, K,) signifies only <i>The camels returned in the evening,</i> or <i>afternoon,</i> (S, * Msb,) when their pastors drove or brought them back to their owners: so says Az. (Msb.) You say, رُحْتُ <br>\
                  اـِلَيْهِمْ and عِنْدَهُمْ, inf. n. رَوْحٌ and رَوَاحٌ, <i>I went,</i> (K, TA,) and <i>I came,</i> (TA,) <i>to them in the evening,</i> or <i>afternoon;</i> [or <i>at any time,</i> as appears from what has been said above;] and so رُحْتُهُمْ, (K, TA,) inf. n. رَوْحٌ; (TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      رَوَّحْتُهُمْ, (K, TA,) inf. n. تَرْوِيحٌ; (TA;) and ↓ <br>\

(A. [See also 6.]) And رَاحَتْ عَلَيْهِ اـِبِلُهُ, and غَنَمُهُ, and مَالُهُ, <i>His camels,</i> and <i>his sheep</i> or <i>goats,</i> and <i>his cattle, returned to him after the declining of the sun from the meridian;</i> only at that time: and ↓ <br>\
      اراحت may perhaps be a dial. var. thereof: (L, TA:) or راحت بِالعَشِىِّ عَلَى اَهْلِهَا <br>\
                  <i>they</i> (i. e. camels) <i>returned from the place of pasture in the evening,</i> or <i>afternoon, to their owners.</i> (S, * Msb.) ―         -b6-  راح الشَّجَرُ, (S, A, K,) aor. يَزَاحُ; (S, A;) and ↓ <br>\
      تروّح; (S, A;) [said in the TA to be tropical, but not so in the A;] <i>The trees broke forth with leaves:</i> (S, A, K:) or the former, <i>the trees broke forth with leaves before the winter, when the night became cold, without rain;</i> (As, TA;) and so the latter: (L:) or the latter, <i>the trees broke forth with leaves after the close of the</i> <br>\

[See another meaning of راح الشجر near the beginning of this art.] ―         -b7-  راح, (S, K,) aor. يَرَاحُ, inf. n. رَاحَةٌ, (S,) said of a horse, [perhaps from the same verb as signifying “ he was, or became, brisk, lively, ” &amp;amp;c.,] <i>He became a stallion,</i> or <i>fit to cover.</i> (S, K.)       -A2-  رَاحَتْهُ الرِّيحُ, aor. تَرَاحُ, <i>The wind smote it;</i> namely, a thing; (L, K;) as, for instance, a tree, and said of a tempestuous wind. (L.) And رِيحَ, said of a pool of water left by a torrent, <i>It was smitten</i> [or <i>blown upon</i>] <i>by the wind.</i> (S, A, K.) In like manner also it is said of other things. (TA.) One says, رِيحَتِ الشَّجَرَةُ <br>\
                  <i>The tree was blown upon by the wind:</i> or <i>was blown about,</i> or <i>shaken, by the wind, so that its leaves were made to fall:</i> or <i>had the dust scattered upon it by the wind.</i> (L.) And رِيحُوا <br>\

                   originally رِوْحٌ, the و being changed into ى because of the preceding kesreh, (T, S, Msb,) as is shown by its dim. mentioned below; (T, Msb;) Sb held it to be of the measure فِعْلٌ; and  Abu-l-Hasan, فِعْلٌ and فُعْلٌ; [if the latter, originally رُيْحٌ;] (TA;) [<i>Wind;</i> i. e.] the <i>air that is made to obey</i> [<i>the will of God</i>] <i>and to run its course between heaven and earth:</i> (Msb, TA:) or the <i>breath</i> (نَسِيم) <i>of the air;</i> and in like manner, <i>of anything:</i> (L, TA:) said to be thus called because it generally brings رَوْح and رَاحَة [i. e. rest, or ease]: (IAmb, MF:) one says رِيحٌ and ↓ <br>\
      رِيحَةٌ, like دَارٌ and دَارَةٌ; (S;) [using the latter as a more special term; for] رِيحَةٌ signifies <i>a portion of wind</i> (طَايِفَةٌ مِنْ رِيحٍ) [meaning <i>a wind of short duration;</i> or <i>a breath, puff, blast,</i> or <i>gust, of wind</i>]; (Sb, M;) but رِيحٌ and ↓ <br>\
      رِيحَةٌ may be used in the same sense; i. e. the latter may be used as syn. with the former, and they are mentioned by some [as analogous] with كَوْكَبٌ and كَوْكَبَةٌ: (Sb, L:) رِيْح is of the fem. gender (IAmb, L, Msb) in most cases; (Msb;) and all the other names for wind are fem. except اـِعْصَارٌ, which is masc.; (IAmb, Msb;) but ريح is sometimes made masc. as meaning هَوَا=ءٌ: (AZ, Msb:) [it is used by physicians as signifying <i>flatus, flatuosity,</i> or <i>flatulence;</i> as in the phrase رِيحٌ غَلِيظَةٌ <br>\
                  <i>a gross flatus:</i>] the pl. [of pauc.] is اَرْوَاحٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.) and اَرْيَاحٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the latter used by some, but disallowed by AHát because there is in it no kesreh to cause the و to be changed into ى, (L, Msb,) and [the pl. of mult. is] رِيَاحٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.,) with ى because of the kesreh, (Msb,) and رِيَحٌ; (K, but not found by SM in any other lexicon;) and the pl. pl. is اَرَاوِيحُ [pl. of اَرْوَاحٌ] and اَرَايِيحُ [pl. of اَرْيَاحٌ]: (K:) the dim. of رِيحٌ is ↓ <br>\
      رُوَيْحَةٌ. (T, Msb.) رِيَاحٌ, or another form of pl., is often used in a good sense; and the sing., in an evil sense; because the Arabs say that the clouds are not made to give rain save by diverse winds blowing together; and this distinction is observed in the Kur-án. (L.) Hence, it is related in a trad., that he [Mohammad] used to say, when wind rose, اَللّٰهُمَّ اْجْعَلْهَا رِيَاحًا وَ لَا تَجْعَلْهَا رِيحًا [<i>O God, make it to be winds, and made it not to be a wind</i>]. (TA.) [But this distinction is not always observed.] One says, فُلَانٌ يَمِيلُ مَعَ كُلِّ <br>\
                  رِيحٍ (tropical:)  [<i>Such a one inclines,</i> or <i>turns, with every wind</i>]. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ كَالرِّيحِ المُرْسَلَةِ [<i>Such a one is like the wind that is sent forth</i> to drive the clouds, and produce rain; (see the Kur xxv. 50;)] meaning, (tropical:)  <i>quick,</i> or <i>prompt, to do acts of kindness,</i> or <i>beneficence.</i> (A.) And رَجُلٌ سَاكِنُ <br>\
                  الرِّيحِ (tropical:)  <i>A man who is calm, sedate, staid,</i> or <i>grave.</i> (A.) ―         -b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  <i>Predominance,</i> or <i>prevalence;</i> and <i>power,</i> or <i>force.</i> (S, K.) A poet says, (S,) namely, Suleyk Ibn-Es-Sulakeh, or Taäbbata-Sharrà, or Aashà of the tribe of Fahm, (TA, and so in one of my copies of the S,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

One says, ذَهَبَتْ رِيحُهُمْ (tropical:)  <i>Their turn of good fortune departed.</i> (A.) And اـِذَا هَبَّتْ رِيَاحُكَ فَاْغْتَنِمْهَا (tropical:)  [<i>When thy turns of good fortune come, avail thyself of them</i>]. (A.) And الرِّيحُ لِا=لِ فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  <i>Aid against the enemy,</i> or <i>victory</i> or <i>conquest,</i> or <i>the turn of good fortune, is to the family of such a one.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  See also رَوْحٌ. ―         -b5-  And see رَايِحَةٌ (with which it is syn.), in four places. ―         -b6-  Also (assumed tropical:)  <i>A good, sweet,</i> or <i>pleasant, thing.</i> (K.) ―         -b7-  The pl. اَرْوَاحٌ occurs in a trad. as meaning (tropical:)  The <i>jinn,</i> or <i>genii;</i> because they are [supposed to be often] invisible, like the wind.
