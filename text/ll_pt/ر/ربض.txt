(Mgh.) Said of a man, it means [(assumed tropical:)  <i>He lay down:</i> and <i>he sat:</i> or] <i>he sat upon his knees:</i> and it may also mean <i>he sat upon his thighs and his buttocks.</i> (Har p. 172.) [And hence, (assumed tropical:)  <i>He remained fixed,</i> or <i>stationary, like an animal lying upon its breast;</i> as is shown by what here follows: whence a signification of رَبَّضَ, q. v.] The saying of Mohammad to Ed- Dahhák, when he sent him to his people, اـِذَا <br>\
                  اَتَيْتَهُمْ فَاْرْبِضْ فِى دَارِهِمْ ظَبْيًا, means <i>When thou comest to them, remain in their abode in security,</i> or <i>without fear, like the gazelle</i> in his covert: (IAar, ISd, K:) or <i>trust them not, but be vigilant, like a wild animal, ready to spring up,</i> for thou wilt be in the midst of the unbelievers; (Az, ISd, K; *) so, if anything induce in thee suspicion, thou mayest flee from them like the gazelle: (Az, ISd, TA:) accord. to each interpretation, ظبيا is in the accus. case as a denotative of state; the subst. being put in the place of the act. part. n., as though for مَتَظَبِّيًا: the former of the two explanations is said to be the more agreeable with the circumstances of the case.

(S.) You say also of a ewe when she is pregnant, قَدْ رُبِضَ عَنْهَا. (Ibn- &#39;Abbád, A.) And you say of a man, رَبَضَ عَنْ مَعَالِى الاُمُورِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He abstained,</i> or <i>held back, from seeking the means of acquiring eminence,</i> or <i>nobility.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  رَبَضَ <br>\
