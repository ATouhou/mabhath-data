                  كَانَتْ تُهَرَاقُ الدِّمَا=ءَ or تُهْرَاقُ, the verb being in the pass. form, and the ه either meftoohah or quiescent, and الدماء being in the accus. case as a specificative; [so that the meaning is, <i>Verily a woman used to pour forth with blood;</i> for تهراق is equivalent to تَرِيقُ; but by rule the specificative should be without the article ال;] or الدماء may be in the nom. case, الدِّمَا=ءُ being for دِمَاوُهَا [i. e. <i>her blood used to pour forth</i>]. (Msb.) ISd says that اَرَاقَ is judged to be originally اَرْوَقَ because the medial radical letter of a verb is more commonly و than ى; and because, when water is poured forth, its clearness appears, and it excites the admiration and approval of its beholder; [to which may be  added, also because one says, هُما يَتَرَاوَقَانِ المَا=ءَ;] though Ks states that رَاقَ المَا=ءُ, aor. يَرِيقُ, signifies <i>The water poured out,</i> or <i>forth:</i> IB says that اَرَقْتُ المَا=ءَ is from راق المَا=ءُ, aor. يَرِيقُ, inf. n. رَيْقٌ, signifying <i>the water went to and fro upon the surface of the earth.</i> (TA.) One says also, of a man, اراق مَا=ءَ ظَهْرِهِ and هَرَاقَهُ and اَهْرَاقَهُ [meaning <i>He poured forth his seminal fluid</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  And اَرِقْ عَنْكَ مِنَ الظَّهِيرَةِ and هَرِقْ meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Stay thou until the mid-day heat shall have become assuaged, and the air be cool;</i> syn. اَبْرِدْ.

[Agreeably with this last explanation, it is said that] رَوْقٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A man&#39;s <i>determination,</i> or <i>resolution;</i> his <i>action;</i> and his <i>purpose,</i> or <i>intention.</i> (K, TA.) And hence the saying, اَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ اَرْوَاقَهُ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>He devoted his mind and energy to it,</i> or <i>him</i>]: (TA:) [or] you say thus, and اَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ شَرَاشِرَهُ, meaning his loving it, or him, (اَنْ يُحِبَّهُ,) vehemently [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  <i>he loved it,</i> or <i>him, vehemently;</i> agreeably with explanations of the saying القى عليه شراشره in art. شر, q. v.]. (Thus in the JM. [In my two copies of the S, and in the O and K, and hence in the TA, in the places of عَلَيْهِ and يُحِبَّهُ we find عَلَيْكَ and تُحِبَّهُ; evidently mistranscriptions which have been copied by one lexicographer after another without due consideration: or, if we read عَلَيْكَ, we should read يُحِبَّكَ; for in this case the meaning of the saying would certainly be <i>he loved thee vehemently.</i> Freytag, misled by the reading تُحِبَّهُ in the S and K, renders القى عليك ارواقه as meaning <i>Magno amore erga ipsum te accendit.</i> Golius gives, in its place, ضرب اوراقه عليه (for ارواقه), as meaning <i>Valde amavit eum.</i>]) ―         -b11-  You say also, اَلْقَتِ السَّحَابَةُ اَرْوَاقَهَا, (JK, S, O, K,) or القت السحابة عَلَى الاَرْضِ ارواقها, (TA,) (tropical:)  <i>The cloud cast down its rain,</i> and <i>its vehement rain consisting of large drops,</i> (S, O, K, TA,) <i>upon the earth:</i> (TA:) or <i>persevered with rain, and remained stationary upon the land:</i> (JK, TA:) or اَلْقَتِ السَّمَا=ءُ بِاَرْوَاقِهَا <br>\
                  <i>The sky cast down all the water that was in it:</i> (IAmb, O, TA:) or this saying, (O, TA,) or the former, (K,) means <i>cast down its clear waters;</i> (O, K, TA;) from رَاقَ المَا=ءُ signifying “ the water was, or became, clear: ” but IAmb deems this improbable, because the Arabs did not say مَا=ءٌ رَوْقٌ and مَاا=نِ رَوْقَانِ and اَمْوَاهٌ اَرْوَاقٌ: (O, TA:) [i. e. they said رَوْقٌ only, in all cases when they used it as an epithet meaning “ clear, ” because it is originally an inf. n., like عَدْلٌ &amp;amp;c.:] or, as some say, by بارواقها is meant <i>its waters rendered heavy by the clouds:</i> and one says, اَرْخَتِ السَّمَا=ءُ اَرْوَاقَهَا and عَزَالِيهَا (assumed tropical:)  [<i>The sky loosed,</i> or <i>let down, its spouts;</i> the clouds being likened to leathern water-bags]: (TA:) [for] رَوْقُ السَّحَابِ means (assumed tropical:)  <i>The</i> <br>\
