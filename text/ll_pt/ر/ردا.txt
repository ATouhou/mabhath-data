                  <i>He strengthened and supported him,</i> or <i>it, by means of it,</i> (Lth, T, M, * K,) namely, a person by a thing, (Lth, T,) or a thing by a thing, (M,) <i>like as one strengthens and supports a wall by means of a structure which he attaches thereto;</i> (T;) as also ↓ <br>\

(K.)       -A2-  Also <i>He rendered it bad, corrupt, vitious, depraved,</i> or <i>the like;</i> (S, K;) namely, a thing; said of a man; (S;) [and ↓ <br>\
      ردّا=هُ is used in the same sense: (see 1 in art. جشب:)] <i>he made,</i> or <i>asserted,</i> or <i>held,</i> <br>\

                  <i>It exceeded another thing;</i> as also اَرْدَى: (M:) [or the latter only:] accord. to IAar, one says اردا عَلَى السِّتِّينَ, with ء, (M,) and, accord. to Lth, على الخَمْسِينَ, (TA,) and, [accord. to F,] على مِايَةٍ, (K,) meaning <i>He exceeded</i> [<i>the</i> age of <i>sixty,</i> and <i>fifty,</i> and <i>a hundred</i>]: (M, K, TA:) but Az says that اردا, with ء, [in these phrases,] though authorized by Lth, is wrong; (TA;) and accord. to A&#39; Obeyed, one says اَرْدَيْتُ. (M. [It is added, however, in the M, that اردا may perhaps be also used in poetry in the same sense without the prep. على.])    </entryFree> <br>\
