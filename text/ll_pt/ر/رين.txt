(M, TA.) ―         -b2-  [Hence also,] رانت <br>\
                  نَفْسَهُ, (S, M, K, *) aor. تَرِينُ, inf. n. as above, (S,) <i>His soul</i> [or <i>stomach</i>] <i>became heavy;</i> or <i>heaved,</i> or <i>became agitated by a tendency to vomit;</i> syn. غَثَتْ, (S, M, K,) and خَبُثَتْ. (S, K.) ―         -b3-  And ران <br>\

(A&#39;Obeyd, S, Mgh, K.) [And رَانَ with يَرُونُ for its aor. signifies the same; as will be seen from a verse cited below.] You say of a sin, misdeed, or transgression, (ذَنْب,) ران عَلَى قَلْبِهِ, (Zj, T, S, Mgh, K,) aor. as above, (Zj, T, S,) inf. n. رَيْنٌ (Zj, T, S, M, K) and رُيُونٌ, (S, M, K,) <i>It covered his heart:</i> (Zj, T, M:) or <i>it overcame his heart.</i> (S, Mgh, K.) رَانَ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبوُنَ, in the Kur [lxxxiii. 14], means [<i>What they used to do</i>] <i>hath become like rust upon the clearness of their hearts,</i> so as to make the knowledge of good from evil to be obscured to them: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or <i>hath covered their hearts:</i> (Zj, T:) or <i>hath overcome their hearts:</i> [or <i>hath spread a blackness upon their hearts;</i> for,] accord. to El-Hasan, it means that sin has followed upon sin so that the heart has become black: (S:) and accord. to Aboo-Mo&#39;adh the Grammarian, and a saying of the Prophet, الرَّيْنُ means the heart&#39;s <i>becoming black in consequence of sins.</i> (T.) You say also, رِينَ عَلى قَلْبِهِ <br>\
                  <i>His heart became covered</i> [&amp;amp;c.]. (M.) And رِينَ بِهِ <br>\

(M.) And ران النُّعَاسُ فِى العَيْنِ <br>\
                  <i>Drowsiness overcame the eye:</i> (S, TA: *) or <i>infected,</i> or <i>pervaded, the eye.</i> (Msb.) Et-Tirimmáh says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>In fear that sleep might overcome them, by reason of the intoxication of their sensations of drowsiness, with every degree of overcoming</i>]. (TA. [This, together with a signification assigned to مَرُونَ in art. رون in the K, shows that رَانَ signifying “ he, or it, overcame, ” &amp;amp;c., has يَرُونَ as well as يَرِينُ for its aor.]) And you say also, ران عَلَيْهِ المَوْتُ, and ران بِهِ, <i>Death took him away.</i> (M.)    </entryFree> <br>\
