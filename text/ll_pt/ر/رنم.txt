      رنّم is said of the pigeon, (M, K,) and of the [bird called] مُكَّاء, (M,) and of the [locust, or species of locust, called] جُنْدَب [meaning <i>it chirped</i>], and of the bow [meaning <i>it emitted a musical ringing sound,</i> or <i>a plaintive sound</i> (see تَرْنَمُوتٌ, below,) when twanged], (M, K,) and [in like manner] of the lute, (M,) and of a thing (M, K:) of any kind (M) of which the sound is esteemed pleasant, or delightful; and تَرَنَّمَ likewise: (M, K:) or you say, الحَمَامَةُ تَتَرَنَّمُ [<i>The pigeon trills,</i> or <i>quavers,</i> or <i>cooes</i>]: and of the مُكَّا=ء you say, ↓ <br>\
      فِى صَوْتِهِ تَرْنِيمٌ [<i>In its voice,</i> or <i>cry, is a trilling,</i> or <i>quavering</i>]: and of the bow, and the lute, and a thing [of any kind] of which the sound is esteemed pleasant, or delightful, ↓ <br>\
      لَهُ تَرْنِيمٌ [<i>It has a musical ringing sound,</i> or <i>a plaintive sound</i>]. (Lth, T.)

                  صَوْتٌ [as meaning <i>A voice,</i> or <i>sound;</i> or, more probably, the <i>uttering thereof:</i> see رَنِمَ, of which it is an inf. n., in the next preceding paragraph]. (S, K.)     <br>\

      رَانِمَةٌ; like as رُمُمٌ is supposed to be of رَامَّةٌ, originally رَامِمَةٌ;] <i>Good,</i> or <i>excellent, female singers.</i> (IAar, T, K.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>رَنْمَةٌ</b>               1     <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                  , (M, and so in copies of the K.) thus it seems to be accord. to [a rule observed in] the K, but accord. to Z it seems to be ↓ <br>\
      رَنَمَةٌ, (TA, and thus it is written in the CK,) and ↓ <br>\
      تَرْنَمُوتَةٌ, (M, and so in the K accord. to the TA,) or ↓ <br>\
      تَرْنَمُوتٌ, (S, [and so in my MS. copy of the K,]) or this last also, (M,) or ↓ <br>\
      تَرْنُومَةٌ or تُرْنُومَةٌ, (accord. to other copies of the K,) <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  تَرَنُّمٌ [i. e. <i>A trilling,</i> or <i>quavering,</i> &amp;amp;c.: see 5]. (S, M, K.) Thus in the phrases, سَمِعَ رَنْمَةً حَسَنَةً and ↓ <br>\
      تَرْنَمُوتَةً [<i>He heard a good,</i> or <i>pleasing, trilling,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (M:) and لَهُ رَنْمَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ or ↓ <br>\

      تَرْنَمُوتٌ is formed by the addition of و and ت, like as is مَلَكُوتٌ: (S:) it is said to be the only instance in which ت is added at the beginning and end of a word: (MF:) and it is used in relation to a bow [as meaning <i>A musical ringing sound</i> on the occasion of twanging]. (S, M.) [↓ <br>\
      رَنِيمٌ, also, said in the TK to be an inf. n. of رَنِمَ, and in the M and K to be syn. with تَرْنِيمٌ, is used in a similar manner:] you say, سَمِعْتُ لَهُ رَنِيمًا [<i>I heard him to have a trilling,</i> or <i>quavering, sound</i> proceeding from him; or <i>I heard it to have a musical ringing sound</i> proceeding from it]; taken from the تَرَنُّم of the bird in its cooing.
