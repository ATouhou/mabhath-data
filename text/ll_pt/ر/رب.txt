      رَبُوبٌ is app. a quasi-pl. n.: (M:) the fem. is ↓ <br>\
      رَبَّةٌ; of which the pl. is رَبَّاتٌ. (T.) Whoever possesses a thing is its رَبّ: you say, هُوَ رَبُّ الدَّابَّةِ [<i>He is the possessor,</i> or <i>owner,</i> or <i>master, of the beast</i>], and الدَّارِ [<i>of the house</i>], (T,) and المَالِ [<i>of the property,</i> or <i>cattle</i>]; (Msb;) and البَيْتِ ↓ <br>\
      هِىَ رَبَّةُ [<i>She is the owner,</i> or <i>mistress, of the house</i> or <i>tent</i>]. (T.) With the article ال, it is [properly] applied only to <i>God:</i> (T, S, M, A, Msb, K:) He is رَبُّ الاَرْبَابِ [<i>The Lord of lords</i>]. (T. [Thus the pl. with the article ال is applied to created beings.]) To any other being it is not [properly] applied but as a prefixed noun governing another noun as its complement in the gen. case [or in a similar manner]. (S.) The pagan Arabs, however, sometimes applied it to A <i>king,</i> (S,) or to a <i>lord</i> as meaning a <i>master</i> or <i>chief:</i> (Msb:) El- Hárith says, (S, Msb,) i. e.

      رَبَّتَهَا [<i>her mistress</i>], accord. to different transmitters; (Msb;) relating to the signs of the hour of resurrection: i. e., the female slave shall bring forth to her master a child that shall be as a master [or mistress] to her because like his [or her] father in rank: meaning that captives and concubines shall be numerous. (TA.) As to the phrase in the Kur [xii. 42], اُذْكُرْنِى عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ [<i>Mention thou me in the presence of thy lord</i>], Joseph thus addressed his fellow-prisoner agreeably with the acceptation in which he [the latter] understood the words. (TA.) A similar instance also occurs in the same chapter, in the verse immediately preceding. (Msb.) In another verse, [23 of the same ch.,] اـِنَّهُ رَبِّى [<i>Verily he is my lord</i>] may refer to Joseph&#39;s master or to God. (M, TA.) The words of the Kur [lxxxix. 28 and 29], اِرْجِعِى اـِلَى رَبِّكِ رَاضِيَةً <br>\
                  مَرْضِيَّةً فَاْدْخُلِى فِى عَبْدىِ, as some read, [instead of عِبَادِى,] may mean <i>Return to thine owner,</i> [<i>approving, approved,</i>] <i>and enter into my servant.</i> (M, TA.) ―         -b2-  Without the article ال, as some say, (L, TA,) it is sometimes written and pronounced ↓ <br>\

      رُبَتَمَا and رَبَتَمَا (M, K) and رُبُتَمَا and رُبْتَمَا and رَبْتَمَا and رُبَتُمَا and رَبَتُمَا and رُبُتُمَا and رُبْتُمَا and رَبْتُمَا and رُبَتْمَا and رَبَتْمَا and رُبُتْمَا: (TA:) [of all these, the most common are رُبَّ and رُبَّمَا: and] ↓ <br>\
      رُبَّتَ is the most common of the forms that have the affix ت: (Mughnee and K on the letter ت:) and the forms with teshdeed are more common than the [corresponding] forms without teshdeed. (M.) It is a word, (M,) or particle, (T, S, Mughnee, K,) governing the gen. case: (S, M, Mughnee, K:) or a noun, (K, TA,) [i. e. an indecl. noun,] in the opinion of the Koofees and some others; but this opinion is rejected by Ibn-Málik in the Tesheel and its Expos., and by AHei, and by IHsh in the Mughnee. (TA.) Accord. to some, (K, TA,) it is used to denote a small number, (T, M, Msb, K, TA,) always, (TA,) or mostly: (Msb, TA:) [thus it may be rendered <i>Few</i> if we render the noun following it as a pl.; and <i>scarce any</i> if we render the noun following as a sing. or a pl.:] it is the <i>contr. of</i> <br>\
                  كَمْ when this latter is not used interrogatively: (T:) [and with مَا affixed, restricting it from government, it may be rendered <i>Few times,</i> or <i>seldom:</i>] or it is used to denote a large number; (K, TA;) i. e. always: so says IDrst: (TA:) [thus used, but such is not always the case, it may be rendered <i>Many,</i> whether we render the noun following it as a sing. or as a pl.: and with مَا affixed, <i>Many times, many a time, oftentimes, ofttimes, often,</i> or <i>frequently:</i>] or it is used to denote a small and a large number; (Mughnee, K;) often the latter, and seldom the former: (Mughnee:) or it is used in a case of boasting, or glorying, (K, TA,) exclusively of other cases, (TA,) to denote a large number: (K, TA:) or it does not denote by itself either a small number or a large number; but one or the other of these meanings is inferred from the context: (K:) [but sometimes neither of these meanings can be clearly inferred from the context: in these cases, it may be rendered <i>Some:</i> and with مَا affixed, <i>Sometimes:</i>] accord. to Er-Radee, its primary meaning is to denote a small number, but it has been so much used to denote a large number as to be in this latter sense as though it were proper, and in the former sense as though it were tropical, requiring context [to explain it]. (Marginal note in my copy of the Mughnee.) [Without the affix ما,] it governs an indeterminate noun (T, * S, Msb, Mughnee, K) only, (T, S, K,) and a pronoun. (S, M, Mughnee.) You say, رُبَّ يَوْمٍ بَكَّرْتُ فِيهِ [<i>Few,</i> or <i>many, days have I gone forth early therein</i>]: (T:) and رُبَّ رَجُلٍ قَايِمٌ [<i>Few,</i> or <i>many, men are standing</i>]: (M:) and رُبَّ رَجُلٍ قَامَ [<i>Few,</i> or <i>many, men stood</i>]: (Msb:) and in like manner, رَجُلٍ ↓ <br>\
      رُبَّتَ; (Msb;) for the ت in this case is not a denotative of the fem. gender. (Msb.) The pronoun affixed to it is of the third pers., (S, M,) and is [generally] sing. and masc., (S, Mughnee,) though it may be followed by a fem. and by a dual and by a pl.: (S:) notwithstanding its being determinate in the utmost degree, its use in this manner is allowable because it resembles an indeterminate noun in its being used without the previous mention of the noun to which it relates; and hence it requires a noun to explain it: (IJ, M:) it annuls the government of رُبَّ; (TA;) and the indeterminate noun that follows it is put in the accus. case as a specificative: (S, Mughnee:) thus you say, رُبَّهُ رَجُلًا قَدْ ضَرَبْتُ [<i>Few,</i> or <i>many, men I have beaten</i>]: (S, M: *) but accord. to the Koofees, you say رُبَّهُ رَجُلًا, (S,) and رُبَّهَا اْمْرَاَةً, (M,) and رُبَّهُمَا رَجُلَيْنش, and رُبَّهُمْ رِجَالًا, and رُبَّهُنَّ نِسَا=ءً: he who puts the pronoun in the sing. [in all cases] holds it to be allusive to something unknown; and he who does not put it in the sing. [when it is not followed by a sing. noun] holds it to be used in reply to a question, as though it were said to a man, “ Hast thou not any young women? ” and he answered, رُبَّهُنَّ جَوَارٍ قَدْ مَلَكْتُ [<i>Few,</i> or <i>many, young women have I possessed</i>]: Ibn-Es-Sarráj says that the grammarians are as though they were of one consent in holding رُبَّ to be a replicative [app. meaning in a case of this kind, with an affixed pronoun]: (S:) [but it is not always a replicative in a case of this kind; though perhaps it was originally:] AHeyth cites as an ex. <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  يَعصُومَهُ وَيَا رُبَّ قَايِمِهِ لَنْ يَقُومَهُ [<i>O, many a keeper of its fast shall not keep its fast</i> again! <i>and O, many a passer of its nights in prayer,</i> or <i>per-</i> <br>\

                  تراويح, again!]. (Mughnee.) [But in this last ex., and in others, it relates to few in comparison with others, though many abstractedly.] ―         -b2-  مَا is affixed to رُبَّ &amp;amp;c. in order that a verb may follow it; (S, Mughnee;) and the verb that follows it is generally a preterite, (T, Mughnee,) as to the letter and the meaning: (Mughnee:) you say, رُبَّمَا جَا=ءَنِى فُلَانٌ [<i>Seldom,</i> or <i>often, such a one came to me,</i> or <i>has come to me</i>]: (T:) sometimes the verb is a future; (T, Mughnee;) but only when it expresses an event of which one is certain: (T:) so in the saying in the Kur [xv. 2], رُبَّمَا يَوَدُّ اْلَّذينَ كَفَرُوا لَوْ كَانُوا <br>\
                  مُسْلِمِينَ, (T, S, M, Mughnee), meaning <i>Often</i> [<i>will those who have disbelieved wish that they had been Muslims</i>]; (Mughnee, Jel;) or <i>seldom,</i> (Zj, T, M, Jel,) because terrors will bereave them of their reason so that they will but seldom recover reason to wish this; (Jel;) for God&#39;s threat is true, as though it had come to pass, and therefore the verb here is equivalent to a preterite [which is often used in the Kur and elsewhere in this manner]. (T.) مَا is also sometimes affixed when a noun follows, (T, Mughnee,) or a nominal proposition, and generally restricts رُبَّ &amp;amp;c. from governing: thus, Aboo-Duwád says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
