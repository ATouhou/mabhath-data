                  , (T, S, M, &amp;amp;c.,) aor. يَرِيبُ, (M, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. رَيْبٌ (T, M, Mgh, Msb, &amp;amp;c.) and رِيبَةٌ, (M, K,) or the latter is a simple subst., (S, Msb,) <i>It</i> (a thing) <i>occasioned in me disquiet, disturbance,</i> or <i>agitation, of mind:</i> (Ksh and Bd in ii. 1:) [this is the primary signification; (see رِيبَةٌ;) a signification also borne by ↓ <br>\
      اَرَابَنِى; (see the verses of Khálid cited in this paragraph;) whence the other significations here expl. in what follows:] <i>it</i> (a thing) <i>made me to doubt:</i> (Msb: and in like manner رَابَهُ is expl. in the Mgh:) or <i>it</i> (a thing, M) <i>caused me to have what is termed</i> <br>\
                  رِيبَة [i. e. <i>doubt,</i> or <i>suspicion</i> or <i>evil opinion,</i> or <i>doubt combined with suspicion</i> or <i>evil opinion</i>]; as also ↓ <br>\
      اَرَابَنِى: (M, K: in both of which this meaning is indicated, but not expressed:) but the latter is said by Lth to be bad: (T:) or, (T, M, Msb,) accord. to AZ, (T, Msb,) the former signifies <i>he,</i> (T, M, *) or <i>it,</i> i. e. his case, (M, * Msb,) <i>made me to know that there was on his part what is termed</i> <br>\
                  رِيبَة [i. e. <i>something occasioning doubt,</i> or <i>suspicion</i> or <i>evil opinion,</i> or <i>doubt combined with suspicion</i> or <i>evil opinion</i>]; (T, M, Msb;) <i>made me to be certain,</i> or <i>sure, of it:</i> (Msb:) and ↓ the latter signifies <i>made me to think that there was in him what is so termed;</i> (Sb, T, M, Msb, K;) <i>without my being certain,</i> or <i>sure, of it:</i> (Msb:) [Az says that] these are the right explanations of the two phrases: (T:) [or] the latter signifies also جَعَلَ فِىَّ الرِّيَبَةَ [<i>he put into me,</i> i. e. <i>into my mind, doubt,</i> or <i>suspicion</i> &amp;amp;c.]; (Sb, M, K; and in a similar manner اَرَبْتُهُ is expl. in the latter;) or اَوْهَمَنِى الرِّيبَةَ [<i>he made me to think that which occasioned doubt,</i> or <i>suspicion</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (K: and in like manner ارابهُ is expl. in the Ham p. 363:) and رِبْتُهُ signifies اَوْصَلْتُ اـِلَيْهِ الرِّيبَةَ [<i>I made doubt,</i> or <i>suspicion</i> &amp;amp;c., or <i>that which occasioned doubt,</i> or <i>suspicion</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>to come to him,</i> or <i>to reach him</i>]; (K;) [app. <i>by some act;</i> for it is said that] رَابَهُ signifies اَتَاهُ بِرِيبَةٍ [<i>he did to him a thing that occasioned doubt,</i> or <i>suspicion</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (Ham ubi suprà:) or, (K,) accord. to Lh, the Arabs say, (M,) رَابَنِى اَمْرُهُ, aor. يَرِيبُنِى, inf. n. رَيْبٌ and رِيبَةٌ: when they speak allusively [with respect to the cause of doubt &amp;amp;c., not expressing it,] (اـِذَا كَنَوْا [misinterpreted in the TA as meaning “ when they affix a pronoun to the verb, ” for the meaning here intended is clearly shown by what follows,]) they prefix ا [to the verb, saying ↓ <br>\
      اَرَابَ, and اَرَبْتُ, &amp;amp;c., expl. in the latter part of  this paragraph]; and when they do not speak allusively [with respect to the cause of doubt &amp;amp;c., but express it,] (اـِذَا لَمْ يَكْنُوا) they reject that letter; but [so accord. to the M, but in the K “ or, ”] it is allowable to say, الاَمْرُ ↓ <br>\
      اَرَابَنِى; (M, K;) i. e., to prefix the ا when the verb is made trans.: (M:) accord. to As, (T,) رَابَنِى [signifies <i>he did what made me to doubt,</i> or <i>to have doubt,</i> or <i>suspicion</i> &amp;amp;c, <i>and what I disliked,</i> or <i>hated;</i> for it] is said of a man when thou seest, on his part, what makes thee to doubt, &amp;amp;c., (مَا يُرِيبُكَ, [or مَا يَرِيبُكَ,]) and what thou dislikest, or hatest: (T, S:) and Hudheyl say, ↓ <br>\
      اَرَابَنِى, (T, S, Msb,) or ارابنى اَمْرُهُ, as As says on the authority of &#39;Eesà Ibn-&#39;Omar; (M;) and رِبْتُ and ↓ <br>\
      اِرْتَبْتُ, meaning <i>I doubted:</i> (Msb:) accord. to IAth, رَابَنِى <br>\
                  الشَّكُّ [an evident mistranscription for رابنى الشَّىْءُ] and ↓ <br>\
      ارابنى both mean شَكَّكَنِى وَ اَوْهَمَنِى الرِّيبَةَ بِهِ [i. e. <i>the thing made me to doubt,</i> and <i>caused me to think that there was that which occasioned doubt,</i> or <i>suspicion</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>in it</i>]; but when you are certain, or sure, of it, you say [only] رَابَنِى, without [an incipient] ا: (TA:) accord. to Lth, رَابَنِى <br>\
                  الاَمْرُ, inf. n. رَيْبٌ, signifies <i>the thing,</i> or <i>event,</i> [app. said only of that which is evil,] <i>betided me,</i> or <i>befell me:</i> and رَابَنِى اَمْرُهُ, <i>his affair,</i> or <i>case, brought upon me doubt</i> (شَكًّا [in the TA شَرًّا i. e. <i>evil</i>]) <i>and fear.</i> (T.) It is said in a trad., of Fátimeh, يَرِيبُنِى مَا يَرِيبُهَا, meaning <i>That displeases and disquiets me which displeases and disquiets her.</i> (TA.) And in another, respecting a gazelle lying curled in sleep, لَا يَرِيبُهُ اَحَدٌ بِشَىْءٍ, meaning <i>No one shall oppose himself to it and disquiet it,</i> or <i>disturb it.</i> (TA.) And in another, مَا رَابَكَ اـِلَى قَطْعِهَا, i. e. <i>What disquieted thee and constrained thee to cut it off?</i> as Aboo-Moosà thinks the phrase may be read: but see another reading voce رَابٌ. (TA.) And in another, دَعْ مَا <br>\
                  وَ اـِنَّ ↓ <br>\
      يَرِيبُكَ اـِلَى مَا لَا يَريبُكَ فَاـِنَّ الكَذِبَ رِيبَةٌ <br>\
                  الصِّدْقَ طُمَاْنِينَةٌ, (Mgh, TA, *) or, as some relate it, ↓ <br>\
      يُرِيبُكَ, (TA,) i. e. <i>Leave thou that which causeth thee to doubt,</i> (Mgh, TA, *) <i>and occasioneth in thee</i> <br>\
                  الرِّيبَة, which originally signifies <i>disquiet,</i> or <i>disturbance,</i> or <i>agitation, of mind,</i> [and hence <i>suspicion</i> &amp;amp;c., and betake thyself <i>to that which will not cause thee to doubt,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>for verily lying is a thing that occasions disquiet of mind,</i> or <i>doubt,</i> or <i>suspicion</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>and verily veracity is</i> a thing that occasions <i>tranquillity;</i>] because the mind is not at rest when it doubts, but becomes tranquil when it is certain, or sure. (Mgh.) And the Hudhalee, (S, TA,) Khálid Ibn-Zuheyr, (TA,) says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> but ↓ <br>\
      اراب when intrans. signifies اَتَى بِرِيبَةٍ [meaning <i>he did an act that occasioned doubt,</i> or <i>suspicion</i> &amp;amp;c.]; like as اَلَامَ signifies اَتَى بِمَا يُلَامُ <br>\
                  عَلَيْهِ [he did an act for which he was to be blamed]: and agreeably with this signification is expl. the verse ascribed to El-Mutalemmis, or to Beshshár Ibn-Burdeh, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

      اربت [here said in the TA to be “ with damm, ” but this is evidently a mistranscription for “ with fet-h, ” for it cannot mean with damm to the ا, as اُرِبْتَ does not bear an appropriate signification, nor can it mean with damm to the ت, as the explanation relates to the reading of اربت with fet-h to the ت,] means <i>thou hast caused</i> [me] <i>to think that there was that which occasioned doubt,</i> or <i>suspicion</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>when it was not decidedly necessary.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

      رِيبَةٌ, (M, K,) or the latter is a simple subst.: (S, Msb:) the primary signification of the latter [and of the former also when it is used as a simple subst.] is <i>Disquiet, disturbance,</i> or <i>agitation, of mind:</i> (Ksh and Bd in ii. 1:) [and hence] the former signifies <i>doubt;</i> (T, S, Msb;) as also ↓ the latter; (S, Mgh;) because doubt disquiets, or disturbs, the mind: (Ksh and Bd ubi suprà, and Mgh:) and <i>opinion;</i> syn. ظَنٌّ: (Msb:) and ↓ the latter, (S, M, A, Mgh, K,) and the former also, (M, A, K,) <i>doubt,</i> or <i>suspicion</i> or <i>evil opinion;</i> syn. تُهَمَةٌ (S, M, A, Mgh, K) and ظِنَّةٌ: (M, A, K:) or the former, [and ↓ the latter also,] <i>doubt combined with suspicion</i> or <i>evil opinion:</i> (IAth, TA:) and <i>a thing,</i> or <i>an event,</i> or <i>a case, that occasions one doubt,</i> or <i>suspicion</i> or <i>evil opinion,</i> or <i>doubt combined with suspicion</i> or <i>evil opinion;</i> i. e. مَا رَابَكَ مِنْ اَمْرٍ: (S, TA:) [in this last sense, the latter is the more common: hence,] lying is termed رِيبَةٌ in a trad. cited above: see 1: (Mgh:) the ↓ pl. of the latter is رِيَبٌ. (Msb.) A man, and a thing or an event or a case, is said to be ↓ <br>\

                  الزمان, which is more agreeable with the explanation, but رَيْب الزمان is more usual,]) <i>that disquiet,</i> or <i>disturb, the minds and hearts:</i> (Ksh:) and رَيْبُ المَنُونِ (S, A) [which likewise signifies] <i>the accidents,</i> or <i>evil accidents, of time:</i> (S:) and رَيْبُ الدَّهْرِ signifies the same; i. e. صَرْفُهُ, (M, K,) or صُرُوفُهُ, (T, Msb,) and حَوَادِثُهُ. (T.
