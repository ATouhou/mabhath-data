This explanation is better than the saying of Lth [that رُمٌّ is an imitative sequent: see the next preceding paragraph]. (T.) One says also, مَا لَهُ حُمٌّ وَلَا رُمٌّ, meaning <i>He has not anything:</i> (S:) or <i>he has neither little nor much.</i> (TA voce حَمٌّ [q. v.]) [See also ثُمٌّ.] ―         -b4-  Also <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
