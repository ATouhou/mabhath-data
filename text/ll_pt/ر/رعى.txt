      ترعّت; [<i>The cattle pastured upon,</i> or <i>depastured, the herbage;</i>] all signifying the same: (TA:) and of a camel you say, رَعَى الكَلَاَ بِنَفْسِهِ, inf. n. رَعْىٌ [&amp;amp;c., <i>He pastured upon,</i> or <i>depastured, the herbage by himself</i>]; and in like manner ↓ <br>\
      ارتعى. (S.) ―         -b2-  The saying of &#39;Áïsheh فَاـِنْ كَانَتْ تَرْعَى مَا هُنَالِكَ is an allusion to the feeling, or touching, of the فَرْج itself. (Mgh.)       -A2-  رَعْىٌ also signifies The <i>keeping,</i> or <i>tending,</i> animals; <i>pasturing,</i> or <i>feeding,</i> them; and <i>defending</i> them <i>from the enemy.</i> (Er-Rághib, TA.) You say, رَعَيْتُ الاـِبِلَ, (S,) or المَاشِيَةَ, (Msb, K,) or الغَنَمَ, (MA,) aor. اَرْعَاهَا, (S, Msb,) inf. n. رَعْىٌ (S, MA) [and رِعَايَةٌ, as appears from a phrase mentioned below,] and رِعْيَةٌ, (MA,) or this last is a simple subst. from this verb, (K,) <i>I</i> [<i>kept,</i> or <i>tended,</i> or] <i>pastured,</i> (MA, Msb,) or <i>lead to pasture,</i> (MA,) <i>the camels,</i> (S,) or <i>the cattle,</i> (Msb, K,) or <i>the sheep</i> or <i>goats;</i> (MA;) and ↓ <br>\
      ارعاها signifies the same as رَعَاهَا. (K.) And صِنَاعَتُهُ رِعَايَةُ الاـِبِلِ [<i>His habitual work,</i> or <i>occupation, is the tending,</i> or <i>pasturing, of camels</i>]. (ISd, K.) And فُلَانٌ يَرْعَى اَبِيهِ [<i>Such a one tends,</i> or <i>pastures, for his father;</i>] i. e. يَرْعَى غَنَمَهُ [<i>tends,</i> or <i>pastures, his father&#39;s sheep</i> or <i>goats</i>].

      راعى, (K, TA,) inf. n. مُرَاعَاةٌ. (TA.) And رِعَا=ءٌ [app. as an inf. n. of ↓ <br>\
      راعى] signifies The <i>guarding of palm-trees.</i> (TA.) فَمَا رَعَوْهَا حَقَّ رِعَايَتِهَا, in the Kur [lvii. 27], means <i>But they did not observe it with its right,</i> or <i>due, observance;</i> were not <i>mindful, watchful, observant,</i> or <i>regardful, of it, in the right,</i> or <i>due, manner of being so.</i> (TA.) You say also, رَعَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ حُرْمَتَهُ, inf. n. رِعَايَةٌ, (ISk, S,) i. e. <i>1 was mindful, regardful,</i> or <i>observant, of his</i> <br>\
                  حرمة [meaning <i>of what was entitled to reverence, respect, honour,</i> or <i>defence, in his character and appertenances</i>]: and in like manner, ↓ <br>\

                  الحُقُوقِ, mentioned in the S, means The <i>being mindful, regardful,</i> or <i>observant, of rights,</i> or <i>dues.</i> (PS.) This last phrase is from ↓ <br>\
      رَاعَيْتُهُ, inf. n. مُرَاعَاةٌ, (TA,) which means <i>I regarded him; had regard,</i> or <i>an eye, to him;</i> or <i>paid regard,</i> or <i>consideration, to him;</i> (S, Msb, K, TA;) <i>acting,</i> or <i>behaving, well to him; doing good to him;</i> or <i>conferring a benefit,</i> or <i>benefits, upon him.</i> (K, TA.) [Hence also, فِيهِ كَذَا ↓ <br>\
      رُوعِىَ <br>\
                  <i>Regard is had, in it,</i> (the meaning of a word or phrase,) <i>to such a thing,</i> as alluded to therein.] And الاَمْرَ ↓ <br>\
      رَاعَيْتُ, (S, K,) inf. n. مُرَاعَاةٌ, (TA,) signifies also <i>I looked to see what would be the issue,</i> or <i>result, of the affair,</i> or <i>case.</i> (S, Msb, K.) Hence, accord. to Er-Rághib, النُّجُومِ ↓ <br>\

(S.) ―         -b3-  رِعَايَةٌ also signifies The <i>being faithful to an engagement,</i> or <i>promise;</i> syn. وَفَا=ءٌ. (Mgh. [See رَاعٍ, below; last sentence.])    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>The ass pastured with the</i> [other] <i>asses:</i> (S, K:) and in like manner one says of camels with wild animals. (TA.) ―         -b2-  راعت <br>\
                  الاَرْضُ, a reading required by the context in the K, is wrong; the correct phrase being ارعت <br>\
                  الاَرْضُ [q. v.]. (TA.) ―         -b3-  See also 1, in the latter half of the paragraph, in eight places. ―         -b4-  المُرَاعَاةُ is also <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  المُنَاظَرَةُ [app. as meaning <i>The looking towards,</i> or <i>facing,</i> a person or thing: a signification nearly like the last referred to in the  sentence here immediately preceding]. (TA.) ―         -b5-  See also 4, in three places. ―         -b6-  وَرِّعِ اللِّصَّ وَلَا تُرَاعِهِ, in a trad. of &#39;Omar, means <i>Restrain thou the thief,</i> or <i>make him to refrain, from taking thy goods, but bear not witness against him:</i> so says Lth: or the meaning is, <i>and do not wait for him.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>ارعى المَاشِيَةَ</b>               1     <br>\

                  <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  رَعَاهَا: see 1, in the former half of the paragraph. Said of God, it means <i>He caused to grow, for the cattle, that upon which they might pasture.</i> (S.) One says also ارعت <br>\
                  الاَرْضُ, [as though المَاشِيَةَ or the like were understood] <i>The land abounded</i> [as though it fed abundantly] <i>with herbage:</i> (Zj, K:) راعت الاَرْضُ, in this sense [as stated above, see 3,] is wrong. (TA.) And ارعاهُ المَكَانَ <br>\
                  <i>He made the place to be a pasturage for him.</i> (ISd, K.) ―         -b2-  اَرعَيْتُهُ سَمْعِى means <i>I made my ear,</i> or <i>ears, to be mindful of his speech:</i> (Er-Rághib, TA:) or <i>I gave ear, hearkened,</i> or <i>listened, to him.</i> (S, Msb.) You say, اَرْعِنِى سَمْعَكَ, (Msb, K,) and ↓ <br>\
      رَاعِنِى, i. e. <i>Hearken thou,</i> or <i>listen thou, to my speech.</i> (K.) Hence ↓ <br>\
      رَاعِنَا in the Kur [ii. 98 and iv. 48]: Akh says that it is of the form فَاعِلْنَا from المُرَاعَاةُ, and means اَرْعِنَا سَمْعَكَ; the ى having gone away because it is an imperative: he says also that it is read رَاعِنًا, as an objective complement, from الرُّعُونَةُ: (S: [see art. رعن:]) the reading in Ibn-Mes&#39;ood&#39;s copy of the Kur-án is رَاعُونَا. (TA.) You say also, هُوَ لَا يُرْعِى اـِلَى قَوْلِ اَحَدٍ <br>\
                  <i>He will not pay any regard,</i> or <i>attention, to the saying of any one.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  And اَرْعَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ <br>\
                  <i>I showed mercy to him</i> [<i>by sparing him,</i> or <i>letting him live,</i> or <i>by pardoning him,</i> or <i>otherwise</i>]; <i>had mercy on him; pitied,</i> or <i>compassionated, him;</i> syn. اَبْقَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ and تَرَحَّمْتُهُ.

                  </quote> [app. meaning <i>If this enchantment be from thee, then spare me not, but renew enchantment</i>]. (TA. [It seems to be there cited as an instance of the verb&#39;s having a second objective complement; (for which I see no reason;) following the assertion that one says, اَرْعَى عَلَيْهِ كَذَا, signifying ابقى; and that the verb is made trans. by means of على as properly meaning ارعاه متطلعا <br>\
                  عليه: but I doubt not that the correct reading is اَرْعَاهُ مُطَّلِعًا عَلَيْهِ, i. e. <i>He showed mercy to him, coming to him,</i> or <i>getting sight and knowledge of him.</i>]) ↓ <br>\
      المُرَاعَا=ةُ, also, [or المُرَاعَاةُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ,] signifies الاـِبْقَا=ءُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   [app. signifies <i>He desired</i> cattle <i>to pasture:</i> and hence, <i>he left</i> them <i>to pasture alone</i>]. You say, اِسْتَرْعَيْتُ مَالِىَ القَمَرَ, meaning <i>I left my cattle to pasture without a pastor to take care of them in the night:</i> and [in like manner,] استرعيتهُ الشَّمْسَ, <i>in the day.</i> (TA in art. قمر.) ―         -b2-  اِسْتَرْعَيْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ (S, K *) <i>I asked him,</i> or <i>desired him, to keep</i> or <i>guard,</i> or <i>be mindful of</i> or <i>regardful of, the thing.</i> (K, * TA.) Hence the prov., مَنِ اْسْتَرْعَى الذِّيْبَ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ [<i>He who asks,</i> or <i>desires, the wolf to keep guard does wrong</i>]; (S, TA;) i. e. he who trusts in one who is treacherous puts trust in a wrong place.

                  <i>He asked,</i> or <i>desired, the ears</i> [meaning <i>the hearers</i>] <i>to mind his discourse,</i> or <i>oration.</i> (Har p. 361.)    </entryFree> <br>\
