See also اُرْمُولَةٌ. ―         -b2-  ↓ <br>\
      اَرْمَلَةٌ is also applied to a woman as meaning <i>Having no husband:</i> (T, S, M, Msb, K:) or <i>a widow;</i> one <i>whose husband has died:</i> (IAmb, Mgh:) or not if she possesses competence, or wealth: (Ibn-Buzurj, T, Mgh, Msb, K:) it is applied to her who has no husband because she is in need of him who would expend upon her; (Msb;) or to her whose husband has died because her provision has gone and she has lost him who earned for her (IAmb, Mgh) and by means of whom her state of life had been good: (IAmb:) in like manner, also, اَرْمَلُ is applied to a man as meaning <i>having no wife,</i> (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) accord. to Kt (T, Mgh) and Sh; (Mgh;) like as اَيِّمٌ is applied to a man [as well as to a woman], and اَيِّمَةٌ to a woman: (T:) or <i>a widower;</i> one <i>whose wife has died:</i> (TA:) or اَرْمَلُ is not applied in this sense except in cases of deviation from the usual course of speech, (IAmb, Mgh, Msb, [and the like is said in the Mgh also as on the authority of Lth, and in the M as on the authority of IJ,]) because the man&#39;s provision does not go in consequence of the death of his wife, since she is not his maintainer, (IAmb, Mgh, Msb,) whereas he is her maintainer: (IAmb:) Jereer says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

(M, TA.) It is said that, if one bequeath his property to the اَرَامِل, some of it is to the men whose wives have died: (Mgh:) IB says, on the authority of IKt, that when a man says, “ This property is for the اَرَامِل, ” it is for the men and the women, because الاَرَامِلُ applies to the males and the women; but he adds, IAmb says that it is to be given to the women exclusively of the men, because الارامل generally applied to the women. (TA. [This is cited in the TA as though relating to ارامل as meaning مَسَاكِين: but IAmb evidently uses it here as applying to women whose husbands have died; and this is its predominant meaning.]) ―         -b3-  It is also applied to a [lizard of the kind called] ضَبّ, in the following saying of a rájiz, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
