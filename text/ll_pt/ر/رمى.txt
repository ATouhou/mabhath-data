                  اـِذْ رَمَيْتَ وَلٰكِنَّ اْللّٰهَ رَمَى, in the Kur [viii. 17], is said by Aboo-Is-hák to be tropical, and to mean (tropical:)  <i>And thou didst not cast</i> [<i>in effect,</i> or] <i>so as to attain the point that was attained,</i> [<i>when thou didst cast,</i>] <i>but God</i> [<i>cast in effect,</i> i. e.,] <i>overruled the casting:</i> or, accord. to Abu-l-&#39; Abbás, the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  <i>thou didst not cast fear,</i> or <i>terror, into their hearts, when thou didst cast the pebbles,</i> [<i>but God cast the fear,</i> or <i>terror:</i>] or, accord. to Mbr, (assumed tropical:)  <i>thou didst not cast with thy strength, when thou didst cast, but with the strength of God thou didst cast</i> [<i>so that in effect God cast</i>].

                  عَلَيْهَا, making the ب to be instead of عن or على. (Msb.) ―         -b4-  And رَمَى القَنَصَ, (S, M,) or الصَّيْدَ, [<i>He shot,</i> or <i>shot at, the animal,</i> or <i>animals, of the chase,</i>] inf. n. رَمْىٌ and رِمَايَةٌ, (Msb,) or رَمْىٌ, and none other.

(M, K. *) [And رَمَاهُ اْللّٰهُ بِكَذَا, sometimes meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>God smote him,</i> or <i>afflicted him, with such a thing:</i> but generally, <i>may God smite him,</i> or <i>afflict him, with such a thing;</i> as in the saying,] رَمَاهُ اْللّٰهُ <br>\
                  بِدَا=ءِ الذِّيْبِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>May God smite him,</i> or <i>afflict him, with the disease of the wolf</i>]; a prov., meaning may God destroy him, or cause him to perish; because [it is said that] the wolf has no disease but death: or, as some say, the meaning is, رَمَاهُ <br>\
                  اْللّٰهُ بِالجُوعِ [<i>may God afflict him with hunger</i>]; because the wolf is always hungry. (Meyd.) And رَمَاهُ بِدَاهِيَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He</i> (God) <i>sent upon him,</i> or <i>against him,.</i> or <i>smote him with, a calamity:</i> and also] (assumed tropical:)  <i>he</i> (a man) <i>made a very sagacious and crafty and politic man to be his assailant.</i> (L in art. حجر. [See also, in that art., رُمِىَ فُلَانٌ بِحَجِرِ <br>\
                  الاَرْضِ, and بِحَجَرِهِ.]) [And رَمَاهُ بِكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  <i>He assailed him with such a thing;</i> as, for instance, reproach, and an argument, &amp;amp;c. Hence,] رَمَاهُ <br>\

(L in art. قرح, in explanation of قَرَحَهُ بِالحَقِّ.) [And رَمَاهُ بِلِسَانِهِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He spoke against him.</i>] ―         -b6-  رَمَى اْللّٰهُ لَكَ means (tropical:)  <i>May God aid thee,</i> or <i>aid thee against thine enemy, and work</i> [<i>good</i>] <i>for thee:</i> (AO, S, TA: *) and رَمَى اْللّٰهُ لَهُ (tropical:)  <i>God aided him,</i> or <i>aided him against his enemy,</i> (AAF, M, K, TA,) <i>and wrought</i> [<i>good</i>] <i>for him:</i> (AAF, M, TA:) and [it is said that] the verb has this meaning in the words of the Kur, وَمَا رَمَيْتَ اـِذْ رَمَيْتَ وَلٰكِنَّ اْللّٰهَ رَمَى [of which other explanations have been given above]; because, when God aids a person against his enemy, He aims at, and smites, (يَرْمِى,) that enemy. (M, TA.) [In like manner, also, فُلَانٌ <br>\
                  يَرْمِى مِنْ وَرَا=ءِ فُلَانٍ means (assumed tropical:)  <i>Such a one defends such a one.</i>] ―         -b7-  رُمِيتُ بِكَذَا (tropical:)  <i>I had such a thing offered,</i> or <i>presented, to me, the meeting with it being appointed,</i> or <i>prepared;</i> [<i>I had it</i> as it were <i>thrown to me,</i> or <i>thrown in my way;</i> as though I were thrown at therewith;] like نُبِذْتُ بِهِ.

[And رَمَى بِبَصَرِهِ الاَرْضَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He cast his eyes on the ground.</i>] ―         -b9-  رَمَى بِالقَوْمِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He,</i> or <i>it, caused,</i> or <i>made, the people,</i> or <i>party, to go forth; expelled them;</i> [or <i>cast them forth;</i>] from one country, or the like, to another. (M, TA.) [See also 6.]) [And رَمَى بِنَاقَتِهِ الفَلَاةَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He urged forth his she-camel,</i> or <i>went forth with her,</i> or <i>journeyed with her,</i> or <i>directed his course with her, into the desert;</i> agreeably with what precedes or with what follows.] رَمْىٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  The <i>going forth</i> from one country, or the like, to another. (Th, M, TA.) And رَمَى الرَّجُلُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The man journeyed.</i> (IAar, T, TA.) And Az says, (TA,) I heard an Arab of the desert say to another, اَيْنَ <br>\
                  تَرْمِى, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Whither dost thou direct thy course.</i> (T, TA.) One says, رَاَيْتُ نَاسًا يَرْمُونَ <br>\
                  الطَّايِفَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>I saw men directing their course to,</i> or <i>towards, Et-Táïf.</i> (Har p. 54.)

(T and TA in art. ثوب.) ―         -b11-  رُمِىَ فِى جِنَازَتِهِ <br>\
                  <i>He has been carried,</i> or <i>lifted, and put, into,</i> or <i>upon, his bier,</i> means (assumed tropical:)  <i>he died,</i> or <i>has died:</i> (TA:) it is said in giving information of a man&#39;s death. (TA in art. جنز.) ―         -b12-  [رَمَى also app. means (assumed tropical:)  <i>He</i> (a governor) <i>imposed</i> an impost upon his subjects: see رَمِيَّةٌ.] ―         -b13-  And رَمَى, aor. يَرْمِى, means also (assumed tropical:)  <i>He misconjectured; thought wrongly;</i> or <i>formed a wrong opinion:</i> (IAar, T:) [and app. <i>he threw out a conjecture:</i> or <i>he spoke conjecturally;</i> for Az adds,] it is like the phrase رَجْمًا بِالغَيْبِ [or رَجَمَ <br>\
                  بِالغَيْبِ or قَالَ رَجْمًا بِالغَيْبِ]. (T.) ―         -b14-  رَمَى السَّحَابُ: see 6. ―         -b15-  رَمَى عَلَى الخَمْسِينَ: see 4.       -A2-  رَمُوَ is a verb of the same kind as قَضُوَ and هَيُوَ, [invariable as to person, time, and mood,] and means <i>Excel-lent</i> [or <i>how excellent</i>] <i>is he in his throwing,</i> or <i>shooting!</i> (IJ, TA voce هَيُوَ, q. v.
