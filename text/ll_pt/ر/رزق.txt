                  ذٰلِكَ لَمَّا رَزَقْتَنِى i. e. لَمَّا شَكَرْتَنِى [<i>I did that since,</i> or <i>because, thou thankedst me</i>]. (TA.) And hence, in the Kur [lvi. 81], وَتَجْعَلُونَ رِزْقَكُمْ اَنَّكُمْ تَكَذِّبُونَ [<i>And do ye make your thanking to be that ye disacknowledge</i> the benefit received, as being from God?]; (K;) i. e., accord. to Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, do ye, instead of acknowledging what God has bestowed upon you, and being thankful for it, attribute it to another than Him? or, accord. to Az and others, [as J also says in the S,] the meaning is, تَجْعَلُونَ شَكْرَ رِزِقْكُمُ التَّكْذِيبَ [<i>do ye make the thanking for your sustenance to be disacknowledgment?</i>]: (TA:) and some read شَكْرَكُمْ [for رِزْقَكُمْ].
