                  , (K, TA,) inf. n. رَفْعٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) <i>He raised it:</i> [this is generally the best rendering, as it serves to indicate several particular significations which will be found explained in what follows:] <i>he elevated it; upraised it; uplifted it: he took it up: contr. of</i> <br>\

      رفّعهُ, (K,) inf. n. تَرْفِيعٌ; (TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      ارتفعهُ; (K;) for accord. to the “ Nawádir, ” you say, ارتفعهُ بِيَدِهِ and رَفَعَهُ [<i>he raised it, lifted it, heaved it,</i> or <i>took it up, with his hand</i>]; but Az says that ارتفع is intrans., and that he has heard no authority for its being trans., in the sense of رَفَعَ, except that which he had read in the “ Nawádir el-Aaráb:” (TA:) رَفْعٌ is sometimes applied to corporeal things, meaning the <i>raising,</i> or <i>elevating,</i> a thing <i>from the resting-place</i> thereof: sometimes to a building, meaning the <i>rearing it, uprearing</i> it, or <i>making</i> it <i>high</i> or <i>lofty:</i> (Er-Rághib:) or in relation to corporeal things, it is used properly to denote motion, and removal: (Msb:) it signifies the <i>putting away or removing</i> or <i>turning back</i> a thing <i>after the coming</i> or <i>arriving</i> thereof; like as دَفْعٌ signifies the putting away or removing or turning back a thing before the coming or arriving [thereof]: (Kull p. 185:) but in relation to ideal things, it is [tropically used, as it is also in many other cases, and] accorded in meaning to what the case requires. (Msb.) [In its principal senses, proper and tropical, رَفْعٌ agrees with the Latin <i>Tollere.</i>.] It is said in the Kur [ii. 60 and 87], رَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ اْلطُّورَ <br>\
                  <i>We raised above you from its resting-place the mountain:</i> and in the same [xii. 2], اَللّٰهُ اْلَّذِى رَفَعَ السَّمٰوَاتِ بِغَيْرِ عَمَدٍ تَرَوْنَهَا [<i>God is He who raised the heavens without pillars that ye see;</i> or, as <i>ye see them</i>]: and in the same [ii. 121], وَاـِذْ يَرْفَعُ اـِبْرٰهِيمُ القَوَاعِدَ مِنَ <br>\
                  البَيْتِ [<i>And when Abraham</i>] <i>was rearing</i> or <i>uprearing</i> or <i>making high</i> or <i>lofty</i> [<i>the foundations of the House of God,</i> at Mekkeh]. (Er-Rághib.) And you say, اِرْفَعْ هٰذَا <br>\
                  <i>Take thou this:</i> (Mgh:) or <i>take it and carry it</i> [<i>away;</i> or <i>take it up and remove it</i>]. (TA.) And رَفَعَ الزَّرعَ, (Lh, K,) or رَفَعَهُ اـِلَى البَيْدَرِ, (Msb,) aor.      <br>\
                     رَفَعَ<br>\
                  , (Lh,) inf. n. رَفْعٌ (Lh, S) and رِفَاعَةٌ and رِفَاعٌ [perhaps a mistranscription for رَفَاعُ, which see below], (Lh, TA,) <i>He removed,</i> or <i>transported, the seed-produce from the place in which he had reaped it,</i> (Lh,) or <i>carried it after the reaping,</i> (S, K,) <i>to the place in which the grain was to be trodden out.</i> (Lh, S, K.) [This last signification is said in the TA to be tropical; but according to a passage of the Msb quoted in the first sentence of this art., it is proper. In most of the phrases here following, the verb is undoubtedly used tropically.] ―         -b2-  رَفَعُوا اـِلَىَّ عُيُونَهُمْ (tropical:)  [<i>They raised towards me their eyes</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b3-  دَخَلْتُ عَلَى فُلَانٍ فَلَمْ يَرْفَعْ بِى <br>\
                  رَاْسًا (Mgh, TA *) (tropical:)  <i>I went in to such a one, and he did not look towards me, nor pay any regard,</i> or <i>attention, to me.</i> (Mgh.) [بِى is not here a mistake for لِى, for the phrase is often found thus written.] ―         -b4-  رُفِعَ لِىَ الشَّىْءُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>The thing was, as it were, raised into view,</i> i. e. <i>it rose into view, to me;</i>] <i>I saw the thing from afar.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  رَفَعَ السَّرَابُ الشَّخْصَ, aor.      <br>\
                     رَفَعَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. رَفْعٌ, (tropical:)  <i>The mirage raised,</i> or <i>elevated</i> [<i>to the eye,</i> (see an ex. near the end of the first paragraph of art. زول)] <i>the figure of a man or some other thing seen from a distance;</i> [or it may be allowable to render it, <i>made it to appear tall, and as though quivering, vibrating,</i> or <i>playing up and down;</i>] syn. زَهَاهُ [of which, when it relates to the mirage, the meaning is best expressed by the latter of the two explanations here given]. (TA.) ―         -b6-  وَرَفَعْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ <br>\
                  فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَاتٍ, in the Kur [xliii. 31], means (assumed tropical:)  <i>And we have exalted some of them above others in degrees of rank,</i> or <i>station:</i> and نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَاتٍ <br>\
                  مَنْ نَشَا=ءُ, in the same, [vi. 83, and xii. 76,] (assumed tropical:)  <i>We exalt in degrees of rank,</i> or <i>station, whom We please:</i> (Er-Rághib:) and وَاْللّٰهُ يَرْفَعُ مَنْ يَشَا=ءُ <br>\
                  وَيَخْفِضُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>And God exalteth whom He pleaseth, and abaseth:</i> (S and TA:) and [in like manner,] رَفْعُ الذِّكْرِ means the <i>exalting of one&#39;s fame;</i> as in the Kur xciv. 4. (Er-Rághib.) But the words, وَاـِلَى السَّمَا=ءِ كَيْفَ رُفِعَتْ, in the Kur [lxxxviii. 18], indicate two meanings; <i>And to the heaven, how it is elevated in respect of its place;</i> and (assumed tropical:)  <i>how it is exalted in respect of excellence, and exaltation of rank.</i> (Er-Rághib.) [In like manner also,] فِى بُيُوتٍ اَذِنَ اْللّٰهُ اَنْ تُرْفَعَ, in the Kur [xxiv. 36], means <i>In houses which God hath permitted to be built;</i> (Bd, TA;) accord. to some: (TA:) or, (assumed tropical:)  <i>to be honoured;</i> (Zj, Bd;) so says El-Hasan; (Zj;) or, (assumed tropical:)  <i>to be exalted in estimation.</i> (Er-Rághib.) It is said in a trad., اـِنَّ <br>\
                  اْللّٰهَ يَرْفَعُ العَدْلَ وَيَخْفِضُهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Verily God exalteth the just, and maketh him to have the ascendency over the unjust, and</i> at one time <i>abaseth him, so that He maketh the unjust to overcome him,</i> in order to try his creatures, in the present world. (Az, TA.) [See also art. خفض.] And you say, رَفَعَهُ عَلَى صَاحِبِهِ فِى المَجْلِسِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He advanced him above his companion</i> [<i>in the sitting-place,</i> or <i>sitting-room,</i> or <i>assembly</i>]. (TA.) And رَفَعْتُكَ عَنْ <br>\
                  كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  [<i>I exalted thee,</i> or <i>held thee, above such a thing</i>]: (M voce رَبَاَ:) and اـِنِّى لَاَرْفَعْكَ عَنْ هٰذَا <br>\
                  الاَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Verily I exalt thee,</i> or <i>hold thee, above this thing</i>]. (S voce رَبَاَ, q. v.) ―         -b7-  رَفَعَ اْللّٰهُ عَمَلَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>God honoured his work by acceptance;</i> or] <i>God accepted his work.</i> (Msb.) It is said in the Kur [xxxv. 11], وَاْلْعَمَلُ الصَّالِحُ يَرْفَعُهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>And righteous</i> <br>\
                  <i>work He will accept:</i> (Jel:) or the meaning is يَرْفَعُ العَمَلُ الصَّالِحُ الكَلِمَ الطَّيَّبَ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>righteous work will cause praise,</i> or <i>the like,</i> (mentioned immediately before the above-cited words of the Kur,) <i>to ascend, and obtain acceptance</i>]: (Mujáhid, TA:) Katádeh says, [that the meaning is,] speech will not be accepted without work. (TA.) ―         -b8-  رَفْعٌ Also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The <i>bringing</i> a thing <i>near;</i> or <i>presenting,</i> or <i>offering, it;</i> syn. تَقْرِيبٌ. (S.) And hence, رَفَعْتُهُ اـِلَى السُّلْطَانِ, (S, Mgh, K,) and اـِلَى الحَكَمِ, (TA,) inf. n. رَفْعٌ (S, * TA) and رُفْعَانٌ (S, K) and رِفْعَانٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  <i>I presented him to,</i> or <i>brought him before,</i> or <i>brought him forward to, the Sultán,</i> (S, * Mgh, * K, * TA,) <i>and the judge, to arraign him and contest with him:</i> (TA:) and اـِلَى الحَاكِمِ ↓ <br>\
      رَافَعَهُ, (S K,) inf. n. مُرَافَعَةٌ, (TA,) [in like manner] signifies (tropical:)  <i>he preferred a complaint against him to the governor,</i> or <i>judge:</i> (K:) or (tropical:)  <i>he presented him to,</i> or <i>brought him before,</i> or <i>brought him forward to, the governor,</i> or <i>judge, to arraign him and contest with him, and preferred a complaint against him:</i> (TA:) [or it denotes the doing so mutually; for, accord. to Mtr,] خَصْمَهُ اـِلَى السُّلْطَانِ ↓ <br>\
      رَافَعَ signifies (tropical:)  <i>he brought his adversary before the Sultán</i> (قَرَّبَهُ <br>\
                  اـِلَيْهِ), <i>the latter doing the same with him.</i> (Mgh.) [See also 2.] ―         -b9-  رَفَعَ القُرْا=نَ عَلَى السُّلْطَانِ (tropical:)  [<i>He adduced,</i> or <i>brought forward, the Kur-án against the Sultán;</i>] <i>he interpreted the Kur-án against the Sultán, and judged thereby that he should rebel against him.</i> (TA.) ―         -b10-  رَفْعْتُ الرَّجُلَ also signifies (tropical:)  <i>I traced up the man&#39;s lineage to his greatest ancestor;</i> or <i>I mentioned his lineage, saying, He is such a one the son of such a one,</i> or <i>He is of such a tribe,</i> or <i>city,</i> &amp;amp;c.; syn. نَمَيْتُهُ, and نَسَبْتُهُ. (TA.) ―         -b11-  And hence, رَفَعَ الحَدِيثَ <br>\
                  اـِلَى النَّبِىِّ (tropical:)  [<i>He traced up,</i> or <i>ascribed,</i> or <i>attributed, the tradition to the Prophet, mentioning, in ascending order, the persons by whom it had been handed down, up to the Prophet;</i> in the manner more fully explained in the sentence here next following]. (TA.) You say also, رَفَعَ <br>\

(assumed tropical:)  <i>He traced up,</i> or <i>ascribed,</i> or <i>attributed, the tradition to the author thereof, by mentioning him,</i> or <i>by mentioning, uninterruptedly, in ascending order, the persons by whom it had been transmitted, up to the Prophet;</i> or <i>by mentioning the person who had related it to him from the Prophet if only one person intervened, saying,</i> “ <i>Such a one told me, from such a one,</i> ” (<i>and so on if more than one intervened between him and the Prophet,</i>) “ <i>from the Apostle of God;</i> ” or <i>with an interruption in the mention of the persons by whom it had been transmitted</i>]. (S * and Msb in art. سند.) [And hence what next follows.] It is said in a trad., رَفَعَتْ اـِلَيْنَا مِنَ البَلَاغِ ↓ <br>\
      كُلُّ رَافِعَةٍ <br>\
                  فَقَدْ حَرَّمْتُهَا اَنْ تُعْضَدَ اَوْتُخْبَطَ, (S, * TA, [in a very old and excellent copy of the former of which I find, as above, اـِلَيْنَا, and so in some copies of the K and in the O and TA in art. بلغ; but in one copy of the S and in the TA in the present art., I find in its place عَلَيْنَا, and so in the CK in art. بلغ, where the verb preceding it is erroneously written رُفِعَتْ; and in the L, in the place of الينا is put عَنَّا; of all which three readings I prefer the first; though the last is agreeable with an explanation of رَفَعْتُهُ given in the Msb and in the sentence next following;]) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  <i>Every company of men</i> (جَمَاعَة, S, TA), or <i>person</i> (نَفْس, TA), <i>that communicates,</i> or <i>announces, from us,</i> (S, TA,) <i>and makes known,</i> [lit. <i>traces up to us,</i>] <i>what we say,</i> (TA,) [or rather, aught <i>of what is communicated,</i> or <i>announced,</i>] or [aught] <i>of what is communicated,</i> or <i>announced, of the Kur-án and of the</i> [<i>statutes,</i> or <i>ordinances,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>termed</i>] سُنَن, (K in art. بلغ,) or the meaning is مِنْ ذَوِى <br>\
                  البَلَاغِ, i. e., التَّبْلِيغِ, [<i>of those who have the office of communicating,</i> or <i>announcing,</i>] the simple subst. being put in the place of the inf. n., (T, O, K, TA, all in art. بلغ,) let that company, or person, communicate, or announce, and relate, that <i>I have forbidden</i> [<i>its trees&#39; being lopped, or being beaten with a stick in order that their leaves may fall off,</i>] referring to El-Medeeneh: (S, * TA:) but some relate it differently, saying, مِنَ البُلَّاغِ [<i>of the communicaters,</i> or <i>announcers,</i>] like حُدَّاث in the sense of مُحَدِّثُون: (TA:) and some say, مِنَ البِلَاغِ, meaning من المُبَالِغِينَ فِى التَّبْلِيغِ, i. e. <i>of those who do their utmost in communicating,</i> or <i>announcing.</i> (Hr, and K in art. بلغ.) ―         -b12-  [Hence,] رَفَعْتُهُ [alone] signifies (tropical:)  <i>I made it known.</i> (Msb.) You say, رَفَعَ عَلَيْهِ كَلَامًا (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He told,</i> or <i>related, a saying against him; informed against him</i>]. (S and K voce رَقَّى, q. v.) And رَفَعَ عَلَى <br>\
                  العَامِلِ رَفِيعَةً (tropical:)  <i>He communicated,</i> (S,) or <i>made known,</i> (Msb,) [or <i>submitted,</i> or <i>referred,</i>] <i>a case</i> [<i>to the administrator of the law</i>]; (S;) and اـِلَى <br>\

                  لَهَا (tropical:)  [<i>An object to be reached,</i> or <i>accomplished, was proposed to him, and he aspired to it</i>].

                  مَرْفُوع [q. v. infrà], (TA,) which is an inf. n. of the intrans. verb رَفَعَ [q. v. infrà] said of a camel (S, TA) and of a beast: (TA:) and ↓ <br>\
      رفّعهُ, (S, TA,) [and رفّعها,] and رفّع مِنْهُ, (TA,) [and مِنْهَا,] inf. n. تَرْفِيعٌ, signify the same: (S, TA:) or the phrase used by the Arabs is اِرْفَعْ مِنْ دَابَّتِكَ (tropical:)  [<i>Make thou thy beast to exert itself,</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (L, TA.) [You say also, app. in like manner, رَفَعَتْنِى <br>\

                  اَنْفُسٍ; (assumed tropical:)  [<i>The pen</i> of the recording angel <i>is withheld from three</i> persons;] a saying of Mohammad, which means that nothing is recorded either for or against three persons; (Mgh, Msb; *) these three being the sleeper until he awakes, the afflicted with disease or the like, or the demented, until he recovers, and the child until he becomes big, or attains to puberty. (El-Jámi&#39; -es-Sagheer of Es-Suyootee; in which we find ثَلَاثَةٍ in the place of ثَلَاثٍ.)
