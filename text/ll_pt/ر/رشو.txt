<b>رِشْوَةٌ</b>               1     <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                   and رُشْوَةٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and رَشْوَةٌ, (Lth, K,) of which the first is that which is the most commonly used, (TA,) <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  جُعْلٌ [as meaning <i>A bribe</i>]; (K, TA;) i. e. (TA) <i>a thing that one gives to a judge,</i> or <i>to another person, in order that he may judge in his</i> [the giver&#39;s] <i>favour, or to incite him to do what he</i> [the giver] <i>desires;</i> (Msb, TA;) or <i>a means of attaining that which one wants, by bribery;</i> not including what is given as a means of obtaining a right or repelling a wrong; for it is related on the authority of several of the leading doctors of the Tábi&#39;ees that there is no harm in man&#39;s bribing for the defence of himself and his property when he fears being wronged; so says IAth: and Lth explains the last of these three words as meaning <i>an act of bribery:</i> (TA:) accord. to Abu-l-&#39;Abbás [i. e. Th], (TA), the former meaning is from رَشَا said of a young bird, explained in the first sentence of this art.: (Msb, TA:) or it is from الرِّشَا=ءُ, (IAth, Mgh, TA,) signifying “ that by means of which one obtains water, ” (IAth, TA,) or “ the rope of the bucket: ” (Mgh:) or, accord. to ISd, the reverse of this is the case: (TA:) the pl. (of the first, Msb, TA) is رِشًا or رِشًى and (of the second, Msb, TA) رُشًا or رُشًى. (S, Msb, K, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>رِشَا=ءٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     رِشَا=ءٌ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>A rope:</i> (S, Msb, K:) [or <i>a well-rope;</i> i. e.] the <i>rope of the bucket:</i> (Mgh:) and ↓ <br>\
      تِرْشَا=ءٌ, also, with kesr, has the same meaning as رِشَا=ءٌ: (K:) hence it would seem that this is generally the case; but they have expressly declared that the latter word has not been heard except in relation to the like of an enchantment, or a fascination: so says MF, pointing to the saying of Lh, that among the phrases of women who enchant, or fascinate, men is اَخَّذْتُهُ بِدُبَّا=ء مُمَلَّاٍ مِنَ <br>\
                  المَا=ء مُعَلَّقٍ بِتِرْشَا=ء [<i>I have enchanted him,</i> or <i>fascinated him, with a gourd, filled with water, suspended by a rope,</i> or <i>well-rope</i>]; and that ترشاء, meaning <i>a rope,</i> is not thus said except in this enchantment, or fascination: accord. to ISd, the last radical of رشاء is judged to be و because one obtains water by means of the رشاء, like as one obtains the thing sought by means of the رِشْوَة; which is the reverse what has been said above, that الرشوة is from الرشاء: (TA:) the pl. is اَرْشِيَةٌ. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.) ―         -b2-  الرَّشَا=ءُ is also the name of (assumed tropical:)  <i>A Mansion of the Moon;</i> (K, TA;) [<i>the Twenty-eighth,</i> which is <i>the last, of the Mansions of the Moon;</i>] so called as being likened to a rope; (TA;) [<i>the northern fish, of the constel-lation Pisces, together with the star beta of Andromeda;</i> or, more correctly, delta <i>and</i> epsilon, <i>with some neighbouring stars, of Pisces;</i>] <i>a group of many stars, in the form of a fish, with the tail towards the south and the head towards the north;</i> (Kzw;) <i>many small stars, in the form of a fish, called</i> [<i>also</i>] بَطْنُ الحُوتِ, <i>in the navel of which is a bright star, which the moon makes one of its mansions;</i> (S, TA;) [or <i>including</i> <br>\
                  بطن الحوت, <i>which is in the navel of Andromeda;</i> for] بطن <br>\
                  الحوت is <i>the name of the bright star</i> [beta] <i>that is above the drapery round the waist of Andromeda:</i> (Kzw, descr. of Andromeda:] الرشاء is <i>also called</i> <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                   The <i>giver of a</i> <br>\
                  رِشْوَة [or <i>bribe</i>]: hence the trad., لَعَنَ اْللّٰهُ الرَّاشِىَ وَالمُرْتَشِىَ وَالرَّايِشَ, i. e. [<i>May God curse</i>] <i>the giver of a</i> <br>\
                  رِشْوَة, who aids another to do what is wrong, <i>and the receiver thereof, and him who is agent between them two,</i> demanding more for this or less for this. (IAth, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>تِرْشَا=ءٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     تِرْشَا=ءٌ<br>\

<b>مُرْتَشٍ</b>               1     <br>\
                     مُرْتَشٍ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\

<b>مُسْتَرْشٍ</b>               1     <br>\
                     مُسْتَرْشٍ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>A seeker, desirer,</i> or <i>demander, of a</i> <br>\
                  رِشْوَة [or <i>bribe</i>]. (TK.) Hence, (TK,) one says, اـِنَّكَ لَمُسْتَرْشٍ لِفُلَانٍ, [in the TA اـِلَى فُلَانٍ,] i. e. مُطِيعٌ لَهُ تَابِعٌ لِمَسَرَّتِهِرص [app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Verily thou art obedient to such a one, subservient to that which gives him happiness</i>].
