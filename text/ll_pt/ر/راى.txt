                  , (S, M, &amp;amp;c.,) for which some say رَا [suppressing the ء and the ى,] (M,) and some say رَا=ءَ, (T in art. بوا, and M and K in art. ريا,) like خَافَ, (TA in the latter art.,) formed by transposition, (T in art. بوا,) first pers. رَاَيْتُ, (M, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.,) for which some say رَيْتُ, without ء, (T, S, M,) but the former is that which is general and preferred, (T, M,) aor. يَرَى (T, S, M,) for which يَرْاَى, agreeably with the root, is said by none except [the tribe of] Teym-erRibáb, (T, M,) or by such as require this form in poetry, (S,) sec. pers. fem. sing. and pl., alike, تَرَيْنَ, so that you say تَرَيْنَنِى [with an affixed pronoun], and if you will you may say تَرَيْنِّى, incorporating one ن into the other by teshdeed, (S,) imperative رَ and اـِرْءَ (AZ, T, S, M,) the people of El-Hijáz saying رَ dual رَيَا, pl. masc. رَوْا and fem. رَيْنَ, and Teym saying اِرْءَ &amp;amp;c., (T, M,) inf. n. رُوْيَةٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and رِيَّةٌ, (T, M, K,) the former being altered to رُوْيَةٌ and then to رُيَّةٌ and then to رِيَّةٌ, (T, M,) and رَاْىٌ (T, S, K) and رَا=ءَةٌ, (S, M, K, [in the CK رَاَة,]) like رَاعَةٌ [in measure], (S,) in which the ة is not necessarily a restrictive to unity, (M,) and رَايَةٌ (K [but this I do not find elsewhere]) and رِيْيَانٌ, (Lh, M, TA,) for which last we find in the copies of the K رُوْيَان, (TA,) <i>He saw</i> [a person or thing] <i>with the eye:</i> (S:) in this sense the verb has [only] one objective complement: (S, Msb:) you say, رَاَيْتُهُ (T, M, Msb, K) and ↓ <br>\
      اِستَرْاَيْتُهُ, (T, M, K,) for which some say اِسْتَرَيْتُهُ, (T, M,) and ↓ <br>\
      اِرْتَاَيْتُهُ, (T, M, K,) for which some say اِرْتَيْتُهُ, (T, M,) all signifying the same, (T, M, K,) <i>I saw him,</i> or <i>it,</i> (a person and a thing, Msb) <i>with the eye;</i> (T, M, Msb, K, TA;) [or so,] and also, <i>with the mind.</i> (M and K in relation to the first, and K in relation to all.) رُوْيَةٌ is of several sorts: (TA:) first, it signifies The <i>seeing with the eye:</i> (M, K, TA:) and <i>with what serves for the same purpose as the organ of sight;</i> as in the saying in the Kur [ix. 106], وَقُلِ اْعْمَلُوا فَسَيَرَىاْللّٰهُ عَمَلَكُمْ [<i>And Say thou, Work ye, for God will see your work</i>]; because the sense of sight cannot be attributed to God: (TA:) [and similar to this is the phrase, رَاَى فِيهِ كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>He saw in him such a thing:</i> and رَاَى مِنْهُ كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>He experienced from him such a thing.</i>] Secondly, The <i>seeing by supposition,</i> or <i>fancy;</i> as in the saying, اَرَى اَنَّ <br>\
                  زَيْدًا مُنْطَلِقٌ [<i>I suppose,</i> or <i>fancy, that Zeyd is going away</i>]. (TA.) Thirdly, The <i>seeing by reflection,</i> or <i>consideration;</i> as in the saying [in the Kur viii. 50], اـِنِّى اَرَى مَا لَا تَرَوْنَ [<i>Verily I see by reflection,</i> or <i>consideration, what ye see not</i>]. (TA.) Fourthly, The <i>seeing with the mind,</i> or <i>mentally;</i> [the <i>opining,</i> or <i>judging,</i> a thing; a sense in which the inf. n. رَاْىٌ is more commonly used;] (M, * K, * TA;) as in the saying in the Kur [liii. 11], مَا كَذَبَ الفُوَادُ مَا رَاَى [<i>The heart did not belie what he mentally saw</i>]. (TA.) [Of these meanings, other exs. here follow; with exs. of similar meanings.] ―         -b2-  An ex. of رَا for رَاَى occurs in the saying of a poet, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                        مَنْ رَا مِثْلَ مَعْدَانَ بْنِ َحْيَى<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>Who has seen the like of Maadán the son of Yahyà?</i> the measure being وَافِر, with the first foot reduced to مُفْعَلْتُنْ]. (M.) الحَمْدُلِلّٰهِ عَلَى <br>\
                  رِيَّتِكِ, for رُوْيَتِكَ, altered in the manner explained above, [meaning <i>Praise be to God for the seeing of thee,</i>] (M, K, *) is a saying mentioned by IAar. (M.) صُومُوا لِرُوْيَتِهِ means [<i>Fast ye</i>] <i>at the</i> time of <i>seeing it;</i> [referring to the new moon of Ramadán;] i. e., <i>when ye see it.</i> (Mgh.) In the phrase رَاَيْتُهُ قَايِمًا [<i>I saw him standing</i>], قايما is in the accus. case as a denotative of state. (Msb.) رَاْىُ عَيْنِى زَيْدًا فَعَلَ ذَاكَ [<i>My eye saw</i> (lit. <i>my eye&#39;s seeing</i>) <i>Zeyd do that</i>] is held by Sb to be an instance of an anomalous use of an inf. n., and is [said to be] the only instance of the kind, among inf. ns. of trans. verbs except سَمْعُ اُذُنِى. (M, TA: but in a copy of the former written رَاْىَ عينى and سَمْعَاذنى.) رَاَيْتُهُ رَاْىَ العَيْنِ means [<i>I saw him,</i> or <i>it,</i>] <i>where the eye,</i> or <i>sight, fell upon him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (TA.) بِعَيْنٍ مَّا اَرَيَنَّكَ [lit. <i>With some eye I will assuredly see thee</i>] is a saying mentioned by AZ as meaning <i>hasten thou,</i> (اِعْجَلْ thus in copies of the S and in the TA, or عَجِّلْ as in one copy of the S,) or <i>work thou,</i> (اِعْمَلْ, thus in two copies of the S,) <i>and be as though I were looking at thee:</i> (S, TA:) it is said to one whom you send, and require to be quick; and means <i>pause not for anything, for it is as though I were looking at thee.</i> (TA in art. عين.) رَاَى المَكَانُ <br>\
                  المَكَانَ (tropical:)  <i>The place faced</i> [or (as we say) <i>looked upon</i>] <i>the place, as though seeing it,</i> (M, TA,) is tropical: (TA:) [and in like manner you say,] دَارِى تَرَى دَارَهُ (tropical:)  <i>My house faces</i> [or <i>looks upon</i>] <i>his house.</i> (T, IAth, TA.) ―         -b3-  رَاَىفِى مَنَامِهِ رُوْيَا [<i>He saw,</i> i. e. <i>fancied that he saw, in his sleep, a vision,</i> or <i>dream</i>]. (S, Msb, K. *) ―         -b4-  اَلَمْ تَرَ اـِلَى <br>\
                  كَذَا [<i>Has thou not considered such a thing,</i> so as to be admonished thereby?] is a phrase used on an occasion of wonder (IAth, K, TA) at a thing, and in rousing the attention of the person to whom it is addressed; as in the saying in the Kur [ii. 244], اَلَمْ تَرَ اـِلَى اْلَّذِينَ خَرَجُوا مِنْ دِيَارِهِمْ [<i>Hast thou not considered those who went forth from their houses,</i> so as to be admonished by their case?]; meaning, hast thou not wondered at their act, and has not their case come to thy knowledge? and so in other instances in the same: (IAth, TA:) Er-Rághib says that, when رَاَيْت is made trans. by means of اـِلَى, it denotes consideration that leads to the becoming admonished. (TA.) In like manner also, (IAth, K,) اَرَاَيْتَكَ and اَرَاَيْتَكُمَا and اَرَاَيْتَكُمْ, (T, IAth, K,) and to a woman اَرَاَيْتَكِ, and to a pl. number of women اَرَاَيْتَكُنَّ, (T,) [which may be lit. rendered <i>Hast thou,</i> and <i>have ye two,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>considered?</i>] are expressions used to arouse attention, (IAth, TA,) meaning <i>tell thou me</i> and <i>tell ye two me</i> &amp;amp;c.; (T, IAth, K;) as in the saying in the Kur [xvii. 64], قَالَ اَرَاَيْتَكَ هٰذَا اْلَّذِى كَرَّمْتُ عَلَىَّ [<i>He</i> <br>\
                  <i>said, Hast thou considered?</i> meaning <i>tell me,</i> respecting <i>this whom Thou hast honoured above me</i>]; and in the same [vi. 40 and 47], قَلْ اَرَاَيْتَكُمْ <br>\
                  اـِنْ اَتَاكُمْ عَذَابُ اْللّٰهِ [<i>Say thou, Have ye considered?</i> meaning <i>tell me, if the punishment of God come upon you</i>]; and occurring without the ك in other places thereof: (IAth, TA:) you say also, اَرَاَيْتَ زَيْدًا and اَرَاَيْتَكَ زَيْدًا, meaning <i>Tell thou me</i> [respecting <i>Zeyd</i>]: (Mgh:) and for اَرَاَيْتَ and اَرَاَيْتَكَ [&amp;amp;c.] some say اَرَيْتَ and اَرَيْتَكَ: (S:) the pronunciation without ء is the more common: the ت in اَرَاَيْتَكَ &amp;amp;c. is always with fet-h; and accord. to the grammarians of accredited science, the ك in these cases is redundant; (T;) [i. e.] it is a particle of allocution, to corroborate the pronoun [ت, which it therefore immediately follows in every case, distinguishing the genders and numbers by its own variations, which are the same as those of the pronominal affix of the second person]: (Bd in vi. 40:) [IHsh says,] the correct opinion is that of Sb; that the ت is an agent, and the ك is a particle of allocution: (Mughnee in art. ك:) but sometimes اَرَاَيْتَكَ &amp;amp;c. mean هَلْ رَاَيْتَ نَفْسَكَ &amp;amp;c.; the ك being in this case an objective complement [and the verb being differently rendered according as it has not, or has, a second objective complement, as is shown here by what precedes and what follows]. (T.) In اَتُرَاكَ, also, [from ↓ <br>\
      اُرِىَ, not from رُيِىَ,] meaning اتظنّ [i. e. اَتَظُنُّ, <i>Thinkest thou?</i>], the pronoun [as some term it, but properly the final particle,] is [a particle of allocution] like that in اَرَاَيْتَكَ in the Kur vi. 40 and 47 [cited above; and in the same sense as this latter phrase, اَتُرَاكَ is used, as meaning <i>tell thou me</i>]. (Har p. 570.) ―         -b5-  When رَاَى means <i>He knew,</i> (S, Msb,) or <i>he thought,</i> (Msb,) it has two objective complements: (S, Msb:) or when it has two objective complements, it necessarily means knowing [or the like]. (Er-Rághib, TA.) [In this case, رَا=هُ may be rendered <i>He saw,</i> or <i>knew, him,</i> or <i>it, to be:</i> and <i>he thought,</i> or <i>judged,</i> or <i>held, him,</i> or <i>it, to be;</i> or <i>he regarded,</i> or <i>held, him,</i> or <i>it, as.</i>] You say, رَاَيْتُ زَيْدًا عَالِمًا, (S, Msb, *) or حَلِيمًا, (M,) <i>I knew</i> [or <i>saw Zeyd to be learned,</i> or <i>forbearing</i>]; (S, M, Msb;) as though seeing him to be so with the eye: (M:) and <i>I thought him</i> [&amp;amp;c.] <i>to be so.</i> (Msb.) In like manner, also, ↓ <br>\
      تَرَا=ءَيْتُهُ signifies <i>I thought him to be.</i> (Har p. 211.) يَرَوْنَهُمْ مِثْلَيْهِمْ رَاْىَ اْلعَيْنِ, in the Kur [iii. 11], means <i>They</i> [who were the unbelievers] <i>thinking them</i> [who were fighting in the cause of God] <i>twice as many as they, according to</i> the evidence of <i>the sight of the eye.</i> (TA.) The pass. form of رَاَى has [only] one objective complement: you say, رُيِىَ زَيْدٌ عَاقِلًا, meaning <i>Zeyd was thought</i> [<i>to be intelligent</i>]: (TA:) and اَلَّذِى اُرَاهُ, with the verb in the pass. form, means الذىاظنّ [i. e. اُظَنُّ, <i>He whom I am thought to be;</i> if from رُيِىَ: or الذىاَظُنُّ, <i>what I think,</i> if from ↓ <br>\
      اُرِىَ: it is often used in the latter sense]. (Msb.) ―         -b6-  You say also, رَاَى فِى الاَمْرِ رَاْيًا [<i>He formed,</i> or <i>held, an opinion,</i> or <i>a persuasion,</i> or <i>a belief, respecting the affair,</i> or <i>case</i>]: (Msb:) and so فِىالفِقْهِ [<i>in the science of the law</i>]. (S.) And الَّذِى اَرَاهُ <br>\
                  <i>That to which I take,</i> or <i>which I hold, as my opinion,</i> or <i>persuasion,</i> or <i>belief.</i> (Msb.) And فُلَانٌ يَرَى رَاْىَ الشُّرَاةِ <br>\
                  <i>Such a one holds,</i> or <i>believes, the tenets,</i> or <i>belief, of the</i> <br>\
                  شراة [a certain sect of schismatics; pl. of شَارٍ]. (M.) When رَاَى is [thus] used as meaning <i>He held,</i> or <i>believed,</i> it has [only] one objective complement. (Msb.) ―         -b7-  لَا تَرَ مَا (T, K, TA, [mentioned also in the K in art. ترم, in which art. in the CK CK it is written لا تَرْما,]) and لَا تَرَى مَا, and لَوْ تَرَ مَا, and لَوْ تَرَىمَا, (T, TA, [in copies of the K اَوْتَرَ مَا, which I think a mistranscription, and for which is put in the TA, as on the authority of IAar, اذ تر ما, app. a mistranscription of a mistranscription, i. e. of اوترما,]) and لَمْ تَرَ مَا, (T, K, TA,) in this last case with تَرَ [only, agreeably with a general rule], are forms of expression meaning لَا سِيَّمَا [i. e., virtually, <i>Above all,</i> or <i>especially</i>]: (T, K, TA:) you say, اـِنَّهُ لَخَبِيثٌ وَلَا تَرَ مَا فُلَانٌ and وَ لَا تَرَى مَا فُلَانٌ and وَ لَوْ تَرَ مَا فُلَانٌ and وَلَوْ تَرَى <br>\
                  مَا فُلَانٌ and .َلَمْ تَرَ مَا فُلَانٌ [i. e. <i>Verily he is bad,</i> or <i>base,</i> or <i>wicked; and above all,</i> or <i>especially, such a one:</i> <br>\
                  وَلَا تَرَ مَا فُلَانٌ, or وَلَا تَرَىمَا فُلَانٌ, properly meaning وَلَا تَرَىمِثْلَ الَّذِى هُوَ فُلَانٌ <br>\
                  <i>and thou will not see the like of him who is such a one;</i> <br>\
                  مِثْلَ and هُوَ being understood: and in like manner are to be explained the other forms of expression here mentioned]: in all of these forms, فلان is in the nom. case: all are mentioned by Lh, on the authority of Ks. (T, TA.) ―         -b8-  رَاَتْ is also said of a woman, as meaning <i>She saw what is termed</i> <br>\
                  التَّرْيِيَة and التَّرِيَّة, i. e., <i>a little yellowness</i> or <i>whiteness </i> or <i>blood on the occasion of menstruation.</i> (M.)       -A2-  رَاَيْتُهُ [form الرِّيَةُ] <i>I hit,</i> or <i>hurt,</i> (S, M, Msb, K, *) or <i>struck,</i> or <i>smote,</i> (Er-Rághib, TA,) <i>his</i> <br>\
                  رِيَة [or <i>lungs</i>]: (S, M, Msb, K, Er-Rághib:) and so وَرَيْتُهُ. (Msb.) ―         -b2-  And رُيِىَ <br>\
                  <i>He had a complaint of his</i> <br>\
                  رِيَة [or <i>lungs</i>]; (M;) as also ↓ <br>\

      اَرَاَيْتُهَا, (T, K,) as some say: (T:) the latter is mentioned by Lh; but [ISd says,] I hold that it is anomalous, and is properly only اَرَيَيْتُهَا. (M in art. رى, and TA.)       -A4-  رَاَىالزَّنْدُ [like وَرَى and وَرِىَ] <i>The</i> <br>\

      رَاَّيْتُهُ, inf. n. تَرْيِيَةٌ: (K:) both are mentioned by Fr: (T:) [accord. to J,] رَا=ءَى فُلَانٌ النَّاسَ, aor. يُرَايِيهِمْ, inf. n. مُرَاا=ةٌ, and رَايَاهُمْ, inf. n. مُرَايَاةٌ, the latter formed by transposition, [which indicates, though written as above in my copies of the S, that we should read رَايَاَهُمْ, inf. n. مُرَايَاَةٌ,] signify the same: (S:) [but it is said in the Mgh that رَايَا (perhaps thus written for رَايَاَ) in the sense of رَا=ءَى is a mistake: and] رَا=ءَى signifies [<i>he acted ostentatiously;</i> i. e.] <i>he did a deed in order that men might see it:</i> (Mgh:) or رِيَا=ءٌ signifies the <i>making a show of what one does to men, in order that they may see it and think well of it:</i> and the <i>acting otherwise than for the sake of God:</i> (Msb, TA:) and it is said in the S to be a subst.

En-Nadr,) that الارا= (i. e. الاـِرْا=ءُ) signifies انتكاثُ خطم البَعيرِ على حَلْقِه: in another copy of the T, on the authority of En-Nadr, that الرا= (a mistranscription for الاـِرْا=ءُ) signifies انتكاث خطم البعير خِلقة: and it is added that the epithet applied to a camel is مُراى (as in one copy, i. e. ↓ <br>\
      مُرْاَى, and thus it is written in the TA, but in the other copy of the T مراْى, an obvious mistranscription); and to camels, مُرا=اتٌ (as in one copy, for مُرْاَاتٌ, i. e. مُرْا=تٌ, in the other copy of the T erroneously written مُرَااة, and in the TA مرايات): therefore the verb is evidently اُرْيِىَ, in the pass. form, inf. n. اـِرْا=ءٌ; and I think that the correct explanation is اِنْتَكَثَ خَطْمُهُ خِلْقَةً, app. meaning <i>His muzzle was thin,</i> or <i>lean, by nature:</i> see art. نكث: and see also مُرْاًى below.]    </entryFree> <br>\
