      تردّى signifies <i>he fell from a mountain and died.</i> (TA.) اـِذَا ↓ <br>\
      تَرَدَّى, in the Kur [xcii. 11], means <i>When he falls into the abyss of the fire</i> [<i>of Hell</i>]: (T, * TA:) or <i>into the cavity of the grave:</i> or <i>into the lowest depth of Hell:</i> or <i>when he perishes:</i> (Bd:) or <i>when he dies.</i> (T.) ―         -b3-  And رَدَى <br>\
                  <i>He</i> (a man) <i>went away.</i> (K.) You say, مَا اَدْرِى اَيْنَ رَدَى <br>\

      ضَبٍّ عِنْدَهُ مِرْدَاتُهُ (S, M, Meyd) i. e. <i>Every dabb has near by it its stone that is to be thrown at it;</i> (S, * Meyd;) for the dabb has little knowledge, therefore it prepares not its hole save by a stone that may be a mark thereof, so that he who seeks it finds the stone that is to be thrown at the dabb near to it; therefore the prov. means that thou shouldst not feel secure from accidents, because calamities are prepared with every time, or period; and it is applied to him who exposes himself to destruction.
