                  , inf. n. رُزْءٌ and مَرْزِيَةٌ, <i>He got,</i> or <i>obtained, from him</i> good (S, K) of any kind. (S.) And رَزَاَ فُلَانٌ فُلَانًا <br>\
                  <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  برّه; [a mistake, through an oversight, for قَبِلَ بِرَّهُ; i. e. <i>Such a one accepted the bounty of such a one;</i>] as also رَزَاهُ, without ء: the former said by AM to be the original. (TA.) And رَزَاَ الشَّىْءَ <br>\
                  <i>He took from the thing, diminished it, lessened it,</i> or <i>impaired it;</i> (K;) and ↓ <br>\
      ترازاهُ signifies the same; or <i>he took from it, diminished it,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>by little and little.</i> (JM.) You say, رَزَاَهُ مَالَهُ, and رَزِيَهُ مَالَهُ, aor.      <br>\
                     رَزَاَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. رُزْءٌ, <i>He got,</i> or <i>obtained, somewhat of his property;</i> as also مَالَهُ ↓ <br>\
      ارتزاهُ. (K.) And مَا رَزَاْتُهُ مَالَهُ, (S,) and مَا رَزِيْتُهُ مَالَهُ, (S, K, *) <i>I did not take from him of his property;</i> or <i>did not diminish to him his property.</i> (S, K. *) And مَا رَزِيْتُهُ شَيْيًا <br>\
                  <i>I did not take from him,</i> or <i>it, aught.</i> (Mgh.) And مَا رَزَاَ فُلَانًا شَيْيًا <br>\
                  <i>He did not get,</i> or <i>obtain, from such a one aught of his property;</i> and <i>did not take from him aught thereof.</i> (TA.) And مَا رَزَاْتُهُ زِبَالًا <br>\
                  <i>I did not take from him,</i> or <i>it, as much as an ant would carry with its mouth:</i> (Har p. 197:) or thus originally, but meaning, <i>anything.</i> (S in art. زبل.) And مَا رَزَاْنَا مِنْ مَايِكَ شَيْيًا <br>\
                  <i>We took not of,</i> or <i>from, thy water, anything:</i> occurring in a trad. (TA.) In another trad., as some relate it, رَزِينَا occurs for رَزِيْنَا, which is the original. (IAth.) Accord. to AZ, [however,] one says, رُزِيْتُهُ, meaning [<i>I had it taken,</i> or <i>received, from me;</i> or, <i>virtually,</i>] <i>it was taken,</i> or <i>received, from me;</i> but not رُزِيتُهُ. (TA.) [Hence, when relating to a moral attribute, or the like, it virtually means (assumed tropical:)  <i>It was experienced from me:</i> see a verse cited voce مُتْلَدٌ, in art. تلد.] You say also, هُوَ يُرْزَاُ, [virtually] meaning <i>He is a bountiful person; one whose gratuitous gifts people obtain.</i> (Ham p. 722.) And اـِنَّهُ لَقَليِلُ الرُّزْءِ مِنَ الطَّعَامِ <br>\
                  <i>Verily he is one who gets little of the food.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  رَزَاْتُهُ also signifies <i>I afflicted him with an affliction, a misfortune,</i> or <i>a calamity.</i> (Msb.) And رَزَاَتْهُ <br>\
                  رَزِيْيَةٌ <br>\
                  <i>An affliction, a misfortune,</i> or <i>a calamity, befell him.</i> (S, Msb.) It is said in a trad., respecting a woman who came asking for her son, اـِنْ اُرْزَاِ اْبْنِى فَلَمْ اُرْزَاْ اَحْبَابِى, meaning <i>If I be afflicted by the loss of my son, I have not been afflicted by the loss of my friends.</i> (TA.)     <br>\
