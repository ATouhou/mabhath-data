                  <i>is stirred about with water &amp;amp;c.;</i> (S, A, K, &amp;amp;c.;) which is <i>a piece of wood the end whereof has several sides;</i> (S, L;) or <i>a piece of wood at the head of which are two cross pieces of wood;</i> (A, Mgh, L;) and <i>sometimes having three prongs:</i> (IAth, TA:) pl. مَجَادِحُ. (L.) ―         -b2-  It is sometimes used tropically, as relating to evil, or mischief. (L.) [Thus it means (tropical:)  <i>A stirrer-up</i> of evil or mischief; or <i>a thing that stirs up,</i> or <i>whereby one stirs up,</i> evil or mischief.] ―         -b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  <i>Any one of the</i> <br>\
                  مَجَادِيحُ السَّمَا=ءِ [or <i>stirrers-up of the sky,</i> or <i>of rain</i>]; (L;) these being <i>the</i> <br>\
                  اَنْوَا=ءٌ [or <i>stars,</i> or <i>asterisms, which, by their auroral settings or risings, were believed by the</i> <br>\

                  <i>that seldom or never failed</i> [<i>to bring rain</i>], <i>accord. to the Arabs:</i> (Mgh:) the ى in the pl. is added to give fulness to the sound of the kesreh; for the regular pl. is مَجَادِحُ, and the sing. of مجاديح should by rule be مِجْدَاحٌ. (A, IAth, Mgh.) One says, ارْسَلَتِ السَّمَا=ءَ مَجَادِيحُهَا (L) or مَجَادِيحُ الغَيْثِ (A) (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Its stirrers-up,</i> or <i>the stirrers-up of rain,</i> or <i>the stars</i> or <i>asterisms which were the bringers of it, sent forth rain</i>]. It is related of &#39;Omar, that he ascended the pulpit to pray for rain, and, having only offered a prayer for forgiveness, descended; whereupon it was said to him, “ Thou hast not prayed for rain; ” and he replied, لَقَدِ اْسْتَسْقَيْتُ بِمَجَادِيحِ <br>\
                  السَّمَا=ءِ (assumed tropical:) [<i>I have indeed prayed for rain by</i> words which are <i>the stirrers-up of rain</i>]; making the prayer for forgiveness to be a prayer for rain, in allusion to a passage in the Kur, lxxi. 9 and 10; and meaning thereby to deny the efficacy of the انواء. (A, * Mgh, * L.) المِجْدَحُ, also pronounced ↓ <br>\
      المُجْدَحُ, (S, K,) thus pronounced by El-Umawee, (S,) is moreover the name of (assumed tropical:) <i>A particular star</i> or <i>asterism, one of those which the Pagan</i> <br>\
                  <i>Arabs asserted to be bringers of rain:</i> (L:) said to be الدَّبَرَانُ [<i>the Hyades;</i> or <i>the five chief stars thereof;</i> or <i> the brightest star thereof, a of Taurus</i>]; (S, A, L, K;) [which is called by this name of الدبران] because it rises latterly [with respect to the Pleiades], (S,) or because it follows (يَدْبُرُ, i. e. يَتْبَعُ,) the Pleiades: (T in art. دبر:) [whence] it is also called حَادِى النُّجُومِ [“ the urger of the stars, ” properly, “ with singing ”], (S,) or حَادِى النَّجْمِ [“ the urger of the asterism, ” meaning, “ of the Pleiades ”], and تَالِى النَّجْمِ [“ the follower of the asterism, ” or, “ of the Pleiades ”], (Kzw,) and التَّالِى and التَّابِعُ [“ the follower ”]: (Sh:) or it is <i>a small star</i> or <i>asterism, between</i> <br>\

                  <i>and</i> <br>\
                  الثُّرَيَّا [or <i>the Pleiades</i>]: (IAar, K:) [perhaps meaning <i>the four stars that are the chief stars of the Hyades exclusively of a Tauri:</i>] or <i>three stars,</i> (Mgh, TA,) <i>like the three stones upon which a cooking-pot rests,</i> (TA,) <i>likened to a three-pronged</i> <br>\
                  مِجْدَح; (Mgh, TA;) <i>on the</i> [<i>auroral</i>] <i>rising of which, heat is expected:</i> (TA:) the Arabs regarded it as one of the انواء which [by their auroral setting] foretokened rain. (IAth.) المِجْدَحَانِ is a name by which some of the Arabs called (assumed tropical:) <i>The two wings of</i> <br>\
                  الجَوْزَا=ء [or <i>Orion</i>]. (Sh, TA.) ―         -b4-  مِجْدَحٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:) <i>A certain mark made with a hot iron upon the thighs of camels.</i> (K.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>Blood drawn from a vein, used in times of dearth,</i> or <i>drought,</i> (S, K,) <i>in the Time of Ignorance:</i> (S:) or <i>blood which was mixed with something else, and eaten in times of dearth:</i> (TA:) or <i>a kind of food of the Pagan Arabs, being blood obtained by opening a vein of a she-camel, which blood was received in a vessel, and drunk.</i> (T, TA.)   </entryFree> <br>\
