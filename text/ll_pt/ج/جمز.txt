(S, TA.) He likens his she-camel to a wild ass, to which he applies the epithet جمزى, that is, <i>swift;</i> meaning, عَلَى حِمَارٍ <br>\
                  جَمَزَى. (TA.) As says that this is the only epithet of the measure فَعَلَى heard by him applied to a male; and that IAar cited the verse above to him saying حَيِّدٍ بِالدِّحَالِ, meaning عَنِ الدِّحَالِ, [i. e., “ shying and turning aside from the hollows, narrow at the top but wide below, in the ground: ” but this is probably a reading of some in the place of حَيَدَى بِالدِّحَالِ, which ends the next verse, agreeably with what is said in the L in art. حيد:] Az says that عَلَى جَمَزَى may be explained as for عَلَى عَيْرٍ ذِى جَمَزَى, i. e., <i>upon an ass having the mode of pace termed</i> <br>\
                  جَمَزَى; and نَاقَةٌ وَكَرَى has a similar meaning. (TA.) ―         -b3-  See also مُجَمِّزٌ.    </entryFree> <br>\
