                  <i>Give thou me some water that I may go my way, and pass from thee.</i> (Aboo-Bekr, TA.) ―         -b2-  Hence, (Aboo-Bekr, TA,) اجازهُ بِجَايِزَةٍ, (Aboo-Bekr, TA,) and اجازهُ بِجَايِزَةٍ سَنِيَّةٍ, (S, A,) (assumed tropical:)  <i>He</i> (the Sultán) <i>gave him a gift,</i> or <i>present,</i> (Aboo-Bekr, TA,) and <i>he gave him a gift,</i> or <i>present, of high estimation.</i> (S, A. *) Or the origin of the expression was this: Katan the son of &#39;Owf, of the tribe of Benoo-Hilál-Ibn-&#39;Ámir-Ibn-Saasa&#39;ah, gave the government of Fáris to &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn- &#39;Abbás; and El-Ahnaf passing by him with his army on an expedition to Khurásán, he waited for them upon a bridge, and said, اَجِيزُوهُمْ [<i>Make ye them to pass over</i>]; and he began to mention the lineage of each man and to give him according to his rank: (S:) or from the fact that a certain commander, having a river between him and an opposing force, said, مَنْ جَازَ هٰذَا النَّهْرَ فَلَهُ كَذَا [<i>Whoso passeth this river shall have such a thing</i>]; and whenever one passed over, he received a جَايِزَة. (TA.) You say also, اَجَازَهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>He gave him.</i> (TA.) And it is said in a trad., اَجِيزُوا الوَفْدَ بِنَحْوِ مَا كُنْتُ اُجِيزُهُمْ بِهِ <br>\
                  <i>Give ye to the party who come as envoys, or the like, a similar</i> <br>\
                  جَايِزَة <br>\

                  <i>The darkness of the night cleared away.</i> (A.)       -A2-  تجوّز فِى صَلَاتِهِ <br>\
                  <i>He relaxed,</i> or <i>remitted, in his prayer;</i> (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) and so in other things; (A;) <i>and abridged it; and was quick in it:</i> said to be from الجَوْزُ “the act of traversing, and going, or passing along:” (TA:) or <i>did less than was sufficient in it.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b2-  Hence, تجوّز فِى اَخْذِ الدَّرَاهِمِ, (A, Mgh,) or تجوّز الدَّرَاهِمَ, (K,) <i>He accepted the dirhems,</i> or <i>pieces of money, as current; did not reject them:</i> (A, Mgh:) see 1: or <i>he accepted them as they were,</i> or <i>notwithstanding what was in them:</i> (Lth, TA:) or <i>he accepted them notwithstanding what was intermixed with them,</i> (K, TA,) [<i>of bad money,</i>] <i>concealed therein, and notwithstanding their fewness.</i> (TA.) In the phrase التَّجَوُّزُ بِدُونِ الحَقِّ [<i>The accepting less than what was due</i>], the inf. n. is made trans. by means of بِ because it implies the meaning of الرِّضَا [which is made trans. by the same means]. (Mgh.) ↓ <br>\
      تَجَاوَزْ also occurs in the sense of تَجَوَّزْ in a trad. of Ibn-Rawáhah: هٰذَا لَكَ وَتَجَاوَزْ فِى <br>\
