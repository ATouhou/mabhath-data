A huntsman beat, or disciplined, or trained, his dog for the purpose of the chase (ضَرَبَهُ عَلَى الصَّيْدِ); and thereupon it was said, ضَرَبَ جِرْوَتَهُ [app. meaning <i>He beat,</i> or <i>disciplined,</i> or <i>trained, his whelp</i>]: and hence this phrase became proverbially used, in instances here following.

                  <i>he endured the thing with patience.</i> (S, TA.) Also ضَرَبْتُ جِرْوَتِى عَنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>I endured with patience the want,</i> or <i>loss, of it:</i> (TA:) or <i>my mind became at ease</i> [<i>respecting it</i>]. (AA, IB, TA.)       -A2-  Also (K, TA, [in the CK ↓ <br>\
