                  <i>The fifth letter of the alphabet:</i> called جِيمٌ, which is one of the names of letters of the fem. gender, but which it is allowable to make masc.: it is one of the letters termed مَجْهُورَة [or vocal, i. e. pronounced with the voice, and not with the breath only]: and of the number of the letters termed مَحْقُورَة, and حُرُوفُ القَلْقَلَةِ, because it cannot be uttered in a case of pause without a strong compression, and a strong sound: and it is also one of those termed شَجْرِيَّة, from الشَّجْرُ, which is the place of opening of the mouth. (TA.) ―         -b2-  It is sometimes substituted for ى, when the latter letter is doubled, (K,) or is so substituted by some of the Arabs; (AA, S;) as in فُقَيْمِجٌّ, for فُقَيْمِىٌّ; (AA, S, K;) and مُرِّجٌّ, for مُرِّىٌّ.

                  </quote> [<i>My maternal uncle is &#39;Oweyf, and Aboo-&#39;Alijj, who feed with flesh-meat at nightfall</i>]; meaning عَلِىّ and عَشِىّ. (S.) It is also sometimes substituted for a single ى. (S, K.) AZ gives the following ex.: <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        يَا رَبِّ اـِنْ كُنْتَ قَبِلْتَ حُجَّتِجْ<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        فَلَا يَزَالُ شَاحِجٌ يَاْتِيكَ بِجْ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>O my Lord, if Thou accept my plea, a brayer</i> (or <i>mule</i>) <i>shall not cease to bring me to Thee</i> (i. e. to thy temple)]; (S;) meaning حُجَّتِى (K) [and بِى]. اَمْسَجَتْ and اَمْسَجَا are also mentioned as occurring in a verse, for اَمْسَتْ and اَمْسَى [because originally اَمْسَيَتْ and اَمْسَىَ]. (S.) But all these substitutions are abominable, (S, Ibn-&#39;Osfoor,) and only allowable in cases of poetical necessity. (Ibn- &#39;Osfoor.) It is further said that some of the Arabs, among whom were the tribe of Kudá&#39;ah, changed ى, when occurring immediately after ع, into ج; and said, for رَاعٍ, [originally رَاعِىٌ,] رَاعِجٌ: this is what is termed عَجْعَجَةٌ: Fr attributes the substitution of ج for ى to the tribe of Teiyi, and some of the tribe of Asad. (TA.) ―         -b3-  Some of the Arabs also changed it into ى; saying شَيَرَةٌ for شَجَرَةٌ, and جَثْيَاثٌ for جَثْجَاثٌ, and يَصَّصَ for جَصَّصَ. (AZ, S in art. يص.)       -A2-  [As a numeral, ج denotes <i>Three;</i> and, as such, is generally written without the dot, but thus ح, or thus ح, to distinguish it from ح, which denotes eight.]   </entryFree> <br>\
