                  <i>the torrent that has torn up the ground;</i> as though the hyena were dragged along in it. (IAar, Sh, TA.) You say also مَطَرٌ جَارُّ الضَّبُعِ, and مَطْرَةٌ جَارَّةُ الضَّبُعِ. (A.) ―         -b3-  اـِبِلٌ جَارَّةٌ (tropical:)  <i>Working camels;</i> because they drag along burdens; (A, Mgh;) or tropically so called because they are dragged along by their nose-reins: (Mgh:) or <i>camels that are dragged along by their nosereins:</i> (S, K, TA: [but in the copies of the S, and in those of the K, in my possession, تَجُرُّ is put for تُجَرُّ, though the latter is evidently meant, as is shown by what here follows:]) جارّة is of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولَةٌ: it is like as when you say عِيشَةٌ رَاضَيَةٌ in the sense of مَرْضِيَّةٌ, and مَا=ءٌ دَافِقٌ in the sense of مَدْفُوقٌ: (S:) or it means <i>such as carry goods, or furniture and utensils, and wheat,</i> or <i>food.</i> (AZ, TA voce حَانٌّ, q. v.) It is said in a trad. that there is no poor-rate (صَدَقَة) in the case of such camels, (S, Mgh,) because they are the ridingcamels of the people; for the poor-rate is in the case of pasturing camels, exclusively of the working. (S.) ―         -b4-  لَا جَارَّ لِى فِى هٰذَا (tropical:)  <i>There is no profit for me in this to attract me to it.</i> (A, TA.)       -A2-  حَارٌّ جَارٌّ is an expression in which the latter word is an imitative sequent to the former; (S, K;) but accord. to A &#39;Obeyd, it was more common to say حَارٌّ يَارٌّ, with ى: (S:) and one says also ↓ <br>\
