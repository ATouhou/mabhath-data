                  قَصْرٌ [<i>A palace:</i> or <i>a pavilion,</i> or <i>kind of building wholly or for the most. part isolated, sometimes on the top of a larger building,</i> i. e., <i>a belvedere, and sometimes projecting from a larger building, and generally consisting of one room if forming a part of a larger building</i>]: (S, K, and Ham p. 823:) or <i>a fortress;</i> syn. حِصْنٌ: (M, IB, TA:) or [<i>a building</i>] <i>resembling a</i> <br>\
