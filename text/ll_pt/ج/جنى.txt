      اجتناها (S, Msb, K) and ↓ <br>\
      تجنّاها: (K:) and in like manner one says of a thing similar to fruit. (TA.) One says also, جَنَاهَا لَهُ and جَنَاهُ اـِيَّاهَا [<i>He gathered it, plucked it,</i> or <i>took it from the tree, for him</i>]. (A&#39;Obeyd, K.) And جَنَيْتُكَ اَكْمُوًا [<i>I gathered for thee truffles</i>]. (TA.) And جَنَى <br>\
                  ذَهَبًا <br>\
                  <i>He collected gold from its mine.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  Aboo-Dhu-eyb uses this verb metaphorically, in the phrase جَنَى العُلَى, meaning (tropical:)  [<i>He acquired</i>] <i>eminence,</i> or <i>nobility.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  You also say, جَنَى عَلَيْهِ, (S,) or عَلَى قَوْمِهِ, (Msb,) inf. n. جِنَايَةٌ, (S, Msb,) (tropical:)  <i>He committed,</i> [<i>against him,</i> or] <i>against his people,</i> or <i>party, a crime,</i> or <i>an offence for which he should be punished;</i> (Msb;) as also ↓ <br>\
      جاناهُ [or جانى قَوْمِهِ]: (TK in art. جر:) [and (tropical:)  <i>he brought an injury upon him,</i> or <i>them:</i>] and جَنَى الذَّنْبِ عَلَيْهِ, aor.      <br>\
                     جَنِىَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. جِنَايَةٌ, (K,) with kesr, (TA,) (tropical:)  <i>He committed the crime, offence,</i> or <i>injurious action, against him;</i> syn. جَرَّهُ اـِلَيْهِ: (K: [see art. جر:]) thus used, also, the verb is metaphorical, from جَنَى الثَّمَرَةَ: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and so in the phrase, جَنَى شَرًّا, meaning (tropical:)  <i>He brought to pass an evil thing</i> or <i>action.</i> (Mgh.) [See also جِنَايَةٌ, below.] It is said in a trad., لَا يَجْنِى جَانٍ اـِلَّا عَلَى نَفْسِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>An injurer shall not bring injury save on himself</i>]; meaning that one shall not be prosecuted for an injurious action committed by another, of his relations or of others. (TA.) And a poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        جَانِيكَ مَنْ يَجْنِى عَلَيْكَ وَقَدْ<br>\

                        تُعْدِي الصِّجَاحَ فَتَجْرَبُ الجُرْبُ<br>\
                  </quote> [which may be rendered, (assumed tropical:)  <i>Thine injurer</i> whom thou shouldst punish <i>is he who brings an injury upon thee: but sometimes the mangy</i> camels <i>infect the sound</i> ones <i>so that these become mangy;</i> and thus a criminal sometimes brings punishment upon his relations: for] A&#39;Obeyd says that جانيك <br>\
                  من يجنى عليك is a prov. applied to the case of a man who is punished for an injurious action; because brothers [sometimes] bring injury upon a man [by occasioning his being punished for an injurious action which they have themselves committed], as the latter hemistich of the verse cited above indicates: but AHeyth says that this prov. means الجَانِى لَكَ الخَيْرَ مَنْ يَجْنِى عَلَيْكَ الشَّرَّ [<i>The person bringing thee good is he who brings,</i> or <i>will bring, upon thee evil:</i> perhaps intended as a caution; for the Arabs often suspect that a benefactor has some evil intention]: and he cites the following hemistich: <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        تُعْدِي الصِّحَاحَ مَبَارِكُ الجُرْبِ<br>\
                  </quote> [meaning Sometimes <i>the places where the mangy</i> camels <i>lie down,</i> and which afford benefit to other camels, <i>infect the sound</i> ones]. (TA. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov., i. 298.]) You say also, جَنَيْتَ هٰذَا عَلَى نَفْسِكَ [<i>Thou hast brought this as an injury upon thyself</i>]. (K in art. جل.)    </entryFree> <br>\

      جَنَاةٌ: (S:) so that these two words are of the same class as حِقٌّ and حِقَّةٌ: or the latter of them is a n. un.: (TA:) or the former signfies <i>what is gathered from trees while fresh;</i> (Msb;) as also ↓ <br>\

      مَجْنًى, also, pl. مَجَانٍ, signifies <i>fruit gathered</i> or <i>plucked:</i> (Har p. 369:) جَنًى also signifies <i>fruit</i> [<i>ready to be gathered</i> or <i>plucked</i>]; so in the Kur lv. 54: (Jel:) and is applied to <i>fresh ripe dates:</i> (Fr, K:) and <i>grapes:</i> (TA:) and <i>truffles,</i> and <i>the like:</i> (S:) and even <i>cotton:</i> (TA:) and <i>herbage:</i> (S:) and <i>gold,</i> (K,) which is collected from its mine: (TA:) and <i>cowries,</i> (K,) as though gathered from the sea: (TA:) and <i>honey,</i> (K,) <i>when it is gathered:</i> (TA:) pl. اَجْنَا=ءٌ (K) and اَجْنٍ, originally اَجْنُىٌ.
