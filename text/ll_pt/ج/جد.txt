(Msb.) اَجِدَّكَ and ↓ <br>\
      اَجَدَّكَ signify the same; (S;) but the former is the more chaste; (TA;) جِدّ and جَدّ being thus used only as prefixed nouns: (S, K:) As says that the meaning is, اَبِجِدٍّ مِنْكَ هٰذَا [<i>Does this proceed from thee in seriousness,</i> or <i>in earnest?</i>]; and that جِدّ is put in the accus. case because of the rejection of the [prep.] ب: AA says that the meaning is, مَا لَكَ اَجِدًّا مِنْكَ [<i>What aileth thee? Doth it proceed from thee in seriousness,</i> or <i>in earnest?</i>]; and that جدّ is put in the accus. case as an inf. n.: Th says that the phrase as it occurs in poetry is اَجِدَّكَ, with kesr: (S:) but when it occurs with وَ [in the place of اَ, or with اَ in the sense of وَ, as a particle denoting an oath,] it is  ↓ <br>\

      اَجَدَّكَ, [or اَجَدِّكَ,] the meaning is, I adjure thee <i>by thy fortune,</i> or <i>good fortune, do not:</i> (Lth, K:) Aboo- &#39;Alee Esh-Shalowbeenee asserts that it implies the signification of an oath. (MF.) In the phrase اجدّك لا تَفْعَلُ, AAF says, we may consider لا تفعل as put in the place of a denotative of state; or the phrase may be originally اجدّك اَنْ لَا تَفْعَلَ, ان being suppressed, and its government annulled: [therefore it may be rendered, in the former case, <i>Is it with seriousness on thy part, thou doing</i> such a thing? and in the latter case, <i>Is it with seriousness on thy part</i> that <i>thou will not do</i> such a thing? i. e. <i>dost thou mean seriously</i> that <i>thou will not do</i> it? or in this case, اجدّك may be used as a form of adjuration in one of the senses explained above, and لَا تَفْعَلُ may mean, that <i>thou do not</i> such a thing; or اجدّك may mean وَجَدَّكَ, (explained above, and so in the three exs. below,) and لَا تَفْعَلُ, <i>thou wilt not do</i> it:] and, as AHei says, there is here a nice point, which is this; that the noun [meaning the pronoun] to which جدّ is prefixed should agree in person with the verb which follows it; so that one should say, اجدِّى لَا اُكْرِمُكَ, and اجدّكَ لَا تَفْعَلُ, and اجدّهُ لَا يَزُورُنَا; because جدّ is an inf. n. corroborating the proposition that follows it.

(Msb, K.) Hence, جِدًّا [meaning <i>In a great,</i> or <i>an extraordinary, degree; greatly, much, exceedingly,</i> or <i>extraordinarily; very; very greatly,</i> or <i>very much; extremely</i>]; as in the phrase, (Msb,) فُلَانٌ مُحْسِنٌ جِدًّا [<i>Such a one is beneficent in a great,</i> or <i>an extraordinary, degree; very, exceedingly,</i> or <i>extremely, beneficent</i>]: you should not say جَدًّا. (S, Msb. * [In my copy of the Msb, it is محسن جدّا بالفتح: but the context shows that there is an omission here, and that, after جدّا, we should read, as in the S, وَلَا تَقُلْ جَدًّا.]) جِدًّا [in a phrase of this kind] is put in the accus. case as an inf. n. [of which the verb is understood; so that, in the ex. given above, the proper meaning is, يَجِدُّ فِى <br>\
