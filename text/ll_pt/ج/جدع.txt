                  </quote> [lit. <i>And nosed fortune became mutilated in the nose;</i> meaning, (assumed tropical:) <i>became marred</i>]. (TA.) And in the following phrase, occurring in a verse, كَاَنَّ اْللّٰهَ <br>\
                  يَجْدَعُ اَنْفَهُ وَعَيْنَيْهِ, the poet means, [<i>As though God cut off his nose</i>] <i>and put out his eyes:</i> see a similar saying in art. قلد, voce تَقَلَّدَ.

      جَدْعًا (S, K) [(<i>May God decree</i>) <i>to him mutilation,</i> or <i>maining, by the cutting off of his nose,</i> or <i>the like;</i> or <i>cause it to befall him:</i> or] meaning اَلْزَمَهُ اْللّٰهُ الجَدْعَ [(assumed tropical:) <i>may God make injury,</i> or <i>diminution of what is good, to cleave to him</i>]: (K:) said in imprecating a curse upon a man: similar to عَقْرًا لَهُ, q. v.: the first word being governed in the accus. case by a verb understood. (TA.) One says also, اِجْدَعْهُمْ بِالاَمْرِ حَتَّى يَذِلُّوا, a phrase mentioned by IAar, but not explained by him; thought by ISd to mean, (tropical:) <i>Act thou, in commanding, as though thou mutilatedst them by cutting off their noses</i> [<i>until they become submissive</i>].

(S.) ―         -b3-  [Hence,] السَّنَةُ تَجْدَعُ النَّبَاتَ (tropical:) [<i>The year of drought cuts off,</i> or <i>destroys, the herbage</i>]: (A, TA:) and تَجْدَعُ بِالمَالِ <br>\
