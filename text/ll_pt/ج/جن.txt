                  جِنّ; (Er-Rághib, TA;) thus called because they are feared but not seen: (S:) or, accord. to others, <i>certain of the spiritual beings;</i> for the spiritual beings are of three kinds; the good being the angels; and the evil being the devils (شَيَاطِين); and <i>the middle kind, among whom are good and evil,</i> being the جِنّ; as is shown by the first twelve verses of ch. lxxii. of the Kur: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or it here means <i>intelligent invisible bodies, predominantly of the fiery,</i> or <i>of the aerial, quality:</i> or <i>a species of souls,</i> or <i>spirits, divested of bodies:</i> or <i>human souls separate from their bodies:</i> (Bd:) or the جِنّ are the <i>angels</i> [<i>exclusively</i>]; (K;) these being so called in the Time of Ignorance, because they were concealed, or because they concealed themselves, from the eyes: so, accord. to some, in the Kur [xviii. 48], where it is said that Iblees was of the جِنّ: and so, as some say, in the Kur [vi. 100], where it is said that they called the جِنّ partners of God: (TA:) but some reject the explanation in the K, because the angels were created of light, and the جِنّ of fire; and the former do not propagate their kind, nor are they to be described as males and females; contrary to the case of the جِنّ; wherefore it is generally said that in the phrase [in the Kur xviii. 48, above mentioned] اـِلَّا اـِبْلِيسَ كَانَ مِنَ الجِنِّ, what is excepted is disunited in kind from that from which the exception is made, or that Iblees had adopted the dispositions of the جِنّ: (MF, TA:) or, as some say, the جِنّ were <i>a species of the angels, who were the guardians of the earth and of the gardens of Paradise:</i> (TA:) ↓ <br>\
      جِنَّةٌ, also, signifies the same as جِنٌّ: (S, Msb, K:) so in the last verse of the Kur: (S:) in the Kur xxxvii. 158 meaning the <i>angels,</i> whom certain of the Arabs worshipped; (TA;) and whom they called the daughters of God: (Fr, TA:) a single individual of the جِنّ is called ↓ <br>\

                  جِنّ: (TA:) or جَانٌّ is a quasi-pl. n. of جِنٌّ; (M, K;) like جَامِلٌ and بَاقِرٌ: (M, TA:) so in the Kur lv. 56 and 74: in reading the passage in the Kur lv. 39, &#39;Amr Ibn- &#39;Obeyd pronounced it جَاَنٌ: (TA:) it is related that there were <i>certain creatures</i> called the جَانّ, <i>who were upon the earth, and who acted corruptly therein, and shed blood, wherefore God sent angels who banished them from the earth;</i> and it is said that these angels became the inhabitants of the earth after them. (Zj, TA.) بَاتَ فُلَانٌ ضَيْفَ جِنٍّ [<i>Such a one passed the night a guest of</i> <br>\
                  جنّ] means, <i>in a desolate place, in which was no one that might cheer him by his society</i> or <i>converse.</i> (TA.) The saying of Moosà Ibn-Jábir, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  جِنّ, <i>did not flee</i> when I came to them and informed them, <i>nor was my tongue, that is like the file, deprived of its sharp edge:</i> or by his جنّ he means his <i>familiar</i> <br>\
                  جنّ, such as were asserted to aid poets when difficulties befell them; and by his مبرد, his <i>tongue:</i> (Ham p. 182 [where other explanations are proposed; but they are far-fetched]:) or by his جنّ he means his <i>heart;</i> and by his مبرد, his <i>tongue.</i> (S.) The Arabs liken a man who is sharp and effective in affairs to a جِنِّىّ and a شَيْطَان: and hence they said, نَفَرَتْ جِنُّهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>He became weak and abject.</i> (Ham ubi suprà.) ―         -b2-  The <i>greater, main,</i> or <i>chief, part,</i> or the <i>main body,</i> or <i>bulk,</i> of men, or of mankind; as also ↓ <br>\
      جَنَانٌ; (K;) because he who enters among them becomes concealed by them: (TA:) or the latter means the <i>general assemblage,</i> or <i>collective body,</i> of men: (IAar, S, * TA:) or <i>what veils, conceals, covers,</i> or <i>protects, one,</i> of a thing. (AA, TA.) ―         -b3-  (tropical:)  The <i>flowers,</i> or <i>blossoms,</i> of plants or herbage. (K, TA.) ―         -b4-  (tropical:)  The <i>prime,</i> or <i>first part,</i> of youth: (S, K, TA:) or the <i>sharpness,</i> or <i>vigorousness, and briskness, liveliness,</i> or <i>sprightliness,</i> thereof. (TA.) You say, كَانَ ذٰلِك فِى جِنِّ شَبَابِهِ (tropical:)  <i>That was in the prime,</i> or <i>first part, of his youth.</i> (S, TA.) And اَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ الاَمْرَ بِجِنِّ ذٰلِكَ (tropical:) <i>I will do that thing in the time of the first and fresh state of that.</i> (S, TA.) جِنٌّ may also signify (assumed tropical:)  The <i>madness,</i> or <i>insanity, of exultation,</i> or <i>of excessive exultation.</i> (TA.) And one says, اِتّقِ النّاقَةَ فَاـِنّهَا بِجِنِّ <br>\
                  ضِرَامِهَا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Fear thou the she-camel, for she is in her evil temper on the occasion of her bringing forth.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  Also <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  جدّ [app. جِدٌّ, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Seriousness,</i> or <i>earnestness</i>]; because it is a thing that is an accompaniment of thought, or reflection, and is concealed by the heart. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
