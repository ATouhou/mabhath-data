                  , aor. يَجِىْءُ, inf. n. مَجِىْءٌ (S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c., [the most common form, but] deviating from the general rule [respecting inf. ns. of this class], for the inf. n. of a verb of the form فَعَلَ having its aor. of the form يَفْعِلُ is [accord. to the general rule, if commencing with an augmentative م,] مَفْعَلٌ, though some words, beside مَجِىْءٌ, deviate from this rule by being of the measure مَفْعِلٌ, [for مَجِىْءٌ is originally مَجْيِيٌ,] as مَعِيشٌ and مَكِيلٌ and مَصِيرٌ and مَسِيرٌ and مَحِيدٌ and مَمِيلٌ and مَقِيلٌ and مَزِيدٌ and مَعِيلٌ and مَبِيعٌ and مَحِيصٌ and مَحِيضٌ, S, * TA) and جَيْيَةٌ (S, K, of the form of an inf. n. of un., but used as an inf. n. in an absolute sense, like رَجْفَةٌ and رَحْمَةٌ, S, TA) and جَىْءٌ, (K,) <i>He,</i> or <i>it, came;</i> or <i>was,</i> or <i>became, present;</i> syn. اَتَى; (S, K;) or حَضَرَ, said of a man [&amp;amp;c.]; (Msb;) or حَصَلَ [meaning <i>it came, came to pass, happened, took place, betided, befell,</i> or <i>occurred; it resulted; it ensued;</i> &amp;amp;c.]; and it is used in relation to ideal, as well as real, substantives; so that اـِذَا جَا=ءَ نَصْرُ اْللّٰهِ [<i>When the assistance of God shall come</i> (in the Kur ex. 1)] is [not a figurative but] a proper phrase. (Er-Rághib, TA.) Sb mentions, on the authority of certain of the Arabs, هُوَ يَجِيكَ [for هو يَجِيْوُكَ <br>\
                  <i>He comes,</i> or <i>will come, to thee</i>], with the hemzeh suppressed: (TA:) and he also mentions يَجُوْءُ as a dial. var. of يَجِىْءُ. (Id. in art. جوا, q. v.) [As shown above,] جَا=ءَ is used intransitively and transitively. (Msb, MF.) say, جَا=ءَ زَيْدٌ <br>\
                  <i>Zeyd came;</i> or <i>was,</i> or <i>became, present.</i> (Msb.) And جِيْتُ مَجِيْيًا حَسَنًا [<i>I came with a good coming;</i> or <i>in a good manner</i>]. (S.) And جِيْتُ زَيْدًا <br>\
                  <i>I came to Zeyd.</i> (Msb.) And sometimes one says, جِيْتُ اـِلَيْهِ meaning <i>I went</i> [as well as <i>I came</i>] <i>to him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (Msb.) And جِيْتُ مِنَ البَلَدِ [<i>I came from the town,</i> or <i>country</i>]: and مِنَ القَوْمِ, meaning مِنْ عِنْدِ القَوْمِ [<i>from the presence of the people,</i> or <i>company of men</i>]. (Msb.) And جَا=ءَ <br>\
                  الغَيْثُ <br>\
                  <i>The rain</i> [<i>came,</i> or] <i>descended.</i> (Msb.) And جَا=ءَ اَمْرُ السُّلْطَانِ <br>\
                  <i>The order,</i> or <i>command, of the Sultán came,</i> or <i>arrived.</i> (Msb.) And جِيْتُ <br>\
                  بِهِ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ <br>\
      اَجَاْتُهُ, both signifying the same, (S, K,) [<i>I came with him,</i> or <i>it;</i>] <i>I brought him,</i> or <i>it, with me.</i> (Msb.) And الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ الَّذِى <br>\
                  جَا=ءَ بِكَ [<i>Praise be to God who brought thee</i>]; and الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ اـِذْ جِيْتَ [<i>Praise be to God because,</i> or <i>that, thou camest,</i> or <i>hast come</i>]; but not الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ الَّذِى جِيْتَ: (S, TA:) and [in like manner] you say, الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ اـِذْ كَانَ كَذَا; but not الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ الَّذِى كَانَ كَذَا unless you say بِهِ or مِنْهُ or عَنْهُ [after الذى]. (ISk, TA.) [Hence, جَا=ءَ بِوَلَدٍ <br>\
                  <i>He begot a child,</i> or <i>children;</i> like اَتَى <br>\
                  بِوَلَدٍ. And جَا=ءتْ بِهِ <br>\
                  <i>She brought him forth; gave birth to him;</i> like اَتَتْ بِهِ. And جَا=ءَ بِمَعْنًى <br>\
                  <i>It</i> (a word) <i>conveyed,</i> or <i>imported, a meaning.</i>] ―         -b2-  [جَا=ءَ بِشَىْءٍ also signifies <i>He brought to pass, did, executed, performed,</i> or <i>effected, a thing:</i> and <i>he said, gave utterance to,</i> or <i>uttered, a thing:</i> like اَتَى بِهِ in both these senses.] And جَا=ءَ كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>He did thus,</i> or <i>such a thing.</i> (TA.) Hence, [in the Kur xix. 28,] لَقَدْ جِيْتِ شَيْيًا فَرِيًّا (TA) [<i>Verily,</i> O Mary, <i>thou hast done</i>] <i>a thing hitherto unknown; a thing deemed strange.</i> (Bd. [See another ex. voce اـِمْرٌ, likewise from the Kur.]) And جِيْتُ شَيْيًا <br>\
                  حَسَنًا <br>\
                  <i>I did a good thing.</i> (Msb.) And جَا=ءَ بِالبَدِيعِ <br>\
                  <i>He produced a new saying,</i> or <i>new poetry, not after the similitude of anything preceding.</i> (TA in art. بدع.) And جَا=ءَ جَرْيًا بَعْدَ جَرْىٍ (K in art. تام) or [more commonly] جاء بِجَرْىٍ بَعْدَ جَرْىٍ (M in that art.) [<i>He</i> (a horse) <i>performed,</i> or <i>fetched, run after run</i>]. ―         -b3-  جَا=ء is also <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  صَارَ, like اَتَى; as in the saying, جَا=ءَ البِنَا=ءُ مُحْكَمًا <br>\
                  <i>The building became,</i> or <i>came to be, firm, strong,</i> or <i>compact.</i> (Kull p. 11.) [And hence the phrase,] مَا جَا=ءَتْ حَاجَتَكَ, (M, K,) thus in all the copies of the K, with the noun in the accus. case; i. e. <i>What became,</i> or <i>has become, thy want?</i> syn. مَا صَارَتْ; (M, K;) or <i>What was thy want?</i> syn. مَا كَانَتْ: (Er-Radee, TA:) ما being here an interrogative, and the [implied] pronoun [in the verb] being made fem. because its predicate is fem.: but some say حَاجَتُكَ, in the nom. case, [as it is in the CK, meaning <i>What did,</i> or <i>has, thy want become?</i>] regarding حاجتك as the subject of جاءت, and ما as the predicate of this verb.

                     ذ<br>\
                   [inf. n. of جَايَاَ] signifies The act of <i>facing,</i> or <i>fronting; being opposite,</i> or <i>over against:</i> (IAar, K:) and the act of <i>coinciding;</i> as also جِيَا=ءٌ. (AZ, K.) You say of a man, جَايَاَنِى مِنْ قُرْبٍ <br>\
                  <i>He faced me, fronted me, was opposite to me,</i> or <i>was over against me, at a short distance.</i> (TA.) And مَرَّ بِى مُجَايَاَةً <br>\
                  <i>He passed by me being in front,</i> or <i>opposite.</i> (TA.) And جَايَاْتُ فُلَانًا <br>\
                  <i>I coincided with such a one in his coming.</i> (TA.) And لَوْ جَاوَزْتَ هٰذَا المَكَانَ لَجَايَاْتَ <br>\
                  الغَيْثَ <br>\
                  <i>Hadst thou passed beyond this place, thou hadst met with rain,</i> or <i>coincided with rain in its coming.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  ↓ <br>\
      جَاا=نِى فَجِيْتُهُ, [so in copies of the S, and in copies of the K, as from the S, but in the TA, as from the S, جَا=ءَاَنِى, and said to be with two hemzehs, though this is evidently wrong,] aor. اَجِيْوُهُ, the former verb of the measure فَاعَلَنِى, (S,) is [said to be] a mistake for جَايَاَنِى فجيته, since the former verb has an infirm letter [ى] for its medial radical and ء for its final, not the reverse, (Sgh, K,) [therefore] what J says is not allowable unless it be an instance of transposition; (IB, TA;) but what is given by F [and Sgh as the correct form] is that which is accord. to rule, and what J says is that which has been heard from the Arabs, as ISd has pointed out; (TA;) [and rule is not to be regarded when it is contr. to classical usage;] the meaning is, <i>He vied with me,</i> or <i>strove to surpass me, in frequency of coming, and I surpassed him therein.</i> (S, K.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>I compelled him, constrained him,</i> or <i>necessitated him, to have recourse,</i> or <i>betake himself, to it;</i> (Fr, S, K;) or <i>made him to want it,</i> or <i>be in need of it:</i> (S:) in the dial. of Temeem, اَشَاْتُهُ. (TA in art. شيا.) It is said in a prov., شَرٌّ مَا يُجِيْوُكَ اـِلَى مُخَّةِ عُرْقُوبٍ [<i>It is an evil thing that compels thee to have recourse to the marrow of a hock</i>]; for, as As says, the عرقوب contains no marrow, and only he who cannot obtain any [other] thing is made to want it. (S.) And it is said in the Kur xix. 23, فَاَجَا=ءَهَا المَخَاضُ اـِلَى جِذْعِ النَّخْلَةِ <br>\
                  <i>And the motion of the child in her womb compelled her to betake herself to the trunk of the palm-tree.</i> (Bd.)    </entryFree> <br>\
