      جَرْحٌ, in its original acceptation; but some of those skilled in the science of lexicology say that the former is employed to denote the effect produced upon bodies by iron instruments and the like; and the latter, that produced upon objects of the mind by the tongue: (MF:) the pl. of the former is جُرُوحٌ and اَجْرَاحٌ [which is a pl. of pauc.] (S, L, K) and جِرَاحٌ; (T, A, L;) but the second of these is of rare occurrence, (K,) only used in poetry: (S, L:) [respecting the third, see what follows:] ↓ <br>\
      جِرَاحَةٌ also signifies the same as جُرْحٌ; (Msb;) and its pl. is جِرَاحٌ (S, Msb, K) and جِرَاحَاتٌ (A, Msb) and جَرَايِحُ; (A;) or جِرَاحٌ is a coll. gen. n., of which جِرَاحَةٌ is the n. un.; or, accord. to Az, this last has not a sing. sense, as Lth asserts it to have, but is a pl. of جُرْحٌ, like as حِجَارَةٌ is of حَجَرٌ, and جِمَالَةٌ of جَمَلٌ, and حِبَالَةٌ of حَبْلٌ.

(A, TA.) اَقْصَصْتُكَ الجُرْحَةَ فَاـِنْ كَانَ <br>\
                  عِنْدَكَ مَا تَجْرَحُ بِهِ الحُجَّةَ فَهَلُمَّهَا, said by the judge of El-Medeeneh to one of the parties in a lawsuit, when about to give judgment against him, means (tropical:)  <i>I authorize thee to adduce anything whereby to invalidate the testimony:</i> [<i>therefore, if thou have anything whereby thou mayest invalidate the allegation, adduce it.</i>] (A, * TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
