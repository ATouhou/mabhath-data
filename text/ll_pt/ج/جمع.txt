                  : see 1. اَجْمَعْتُ الشَّىْءَ signifies <i>I put the thing together;</i> such, for instance, as spoil, or plunder. (S.) You say, اَجْمَعْتُ النَّهْبِ, meaning <i>I collected together from every quarter the camels taken as spoil from the people to whom they belonged, and drove them away:</i> (AHeyth:) or اـِجْمَاعٌ signifies [simply] the <i>driving</i> of camels <i>together,</i> or <i>collectively.</i> (K.) ―         -b2-  الاـِجْمَاعُ also signifies <i>The composing and settling a thing which has been discomposed</i> [<i>and unsettled</i>]; <i>as an opinion upon which one determines, resolves,</i> or <i>decides:</i> (TA:) or جَعْلُ الاَمْرِ جَمِيعًا بَعْدَ تَفَرُّقِهِ, (AHeyth, K,) i. e. <i>the determining, resolving,</i> or <i>deciding, upon an affair, so as to make it firmly settled,</i> [<i>after it had been unsettled in the mind,</i> or] <i>after considering what might be its issues, or results, and saying at one time, I will do thus, and at another time, I will do thus.</i> (AHeyth.) You say, اَجْمَعْتُ الاَمْرَ, (Ks, S, Mgh, * Msb, K,) and عَلَى الاَمْرِ, (Mgh, * Msb, K,) <i>I determined, resolved,</i> or <i>decided, upon the affair;</i> (Ks, S, Mgh, * Msb, K;) as though I collected myself, or my mind, for it; (TA;) as, for instance, a journeying, and a fasting, (Mgh, Msb,) and a going forth, and a tarrying or an abiding; (TA;) and in like manner, اَمْرَهُ ↓ <br>\

You say also, اَجْمِعْ اَمْرَكَ وَلَا تَدَعْهُ مُنْتَشِرًا [<i>Determine thou,</i> or <i>decide, upon thine affair, and do not leave it unsettled</i>]. (S.) The saying, in the Kur [x. 72], فَاَجْمَعُوا اَمْرَكُمْ وَشُرَكَا=ءَ كُمْ means <i>Then determine ye,</i> or <i>resolve,</i> or <i>decide, upon your affair,</i> (Fr, Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, Bd,) <i>and prepare for it,</i> (Fr,) or اِجْعَلُوهُ جَمِيعًا, [which has the former of these meanings, as shown above,] (AHeyth,) <i>and call ye your companions,</i> (Fr, S, Bd, K,) شركاءكم being governed in the accus. case by the verb understood, (Bd, TA,) becanse the verb in the text is not used with شركاء for its object, (S, K,) but only the unaugmented verb: (S:) or the meaning is <i>then determine ye, with your companions, upon your affair;</i> (Bd, K;) so says Aboo-Is-hák, adding that what Fr says is erroneous: (TA:) or <i>then determine ye upon your affair and</i> the affair of <i>your companions,</i> for وَاَمْرَ <br>\
                  شُرَكَايِكُمْ. (Bd.) It is also said that the phrase, in the Kur [xx. 67], فَاَجْمِعُوا كَيْدَكُمْ means <i>Therefore determine ye, or resolve, or decide, upon your artifice, or stratagem:</i> (TA:) but some read كَيْدَكُمْ ↓ <br>\
      فَاْجْمَعُوا, (Bd, TA,) meaning <i>therefore combine ye all your artifice; leave nothing thereof unexerted;</i> (TA;) and this latter reading is favoured by the phrase كَيْدَهُ ↓ <br>\
      فَجَمَع [in verse 62 of the same ch.]. (Bd.) ―         -b3-  Also <i>The agreeing, or uniting, in opinion.</i> (K, * TA.)

You say, اجمع بِالنَّاقَةِ, (S, TA,) and اجمع النَّاقَةِ, (TA,) <i>He so bound the teats of the she-camel;</i> (S, TA;) and so اَكْمَشَ بِهَا.
