(TA.) One says also, جَبَرْتُ فَاقَةَ الرَّجُلِ (tropical:)  [<i>I repaired the broken fortune of the man;</i>] <i>I restored the man to wealth,</i> or <i>competence,</i> or <i>sufficiency.</i> (A Heyth, TA.)

And جَبَرَهُ اْللّٰهُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>May God render him sound, and strong</i>]: said in relation to a child. (S and K in art. زرع.) And جَبَرْتُ نِصَابَ الزَّكَاةِ بِكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  <i>I made the amount of the property equal to that which renders it incumbent on the possessor to pay the poor-rate, by</i> [adding] <i>such a thing:</i> the name of that thing is جبران [app. ↓ <br>\
      جُبْرَانٌ]: and the person who does this is termed ↓ <br>\
      جَابِرٌ. (Msb.)       -A2-  جَبَرَ also signifies <i>He compelled,</i> or <i>constrained,</i> another. (B.) You say, جَبَرَهُ عَلَى الاَمْرِ, (Lh, Az, Msb, K,) aor.      <br>\

      اجبرهُ; (Th, S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.;) both these forms of the verb mentioned by AZ, Fr, A &#39;Obeyd, and others, (Msb,) but the latter is the form used by the generality of the Arabs, (Lh, TA,) and by the grammarians [in general]; (TA;) <i>He compelled him, against his will, to do the thing:</i> (Lh, Th, Az, S, Msb, K:) ↓ <br>\
      اـِجْبَارٌ originally signifying the <i>inciting, urging,</i> or <i>inducing,</i> another <i>to restore a thing to a sound, right,</i> or <i>good, state.</i> (B.) And عَلَى الحُكْمِ ↓ <br>\
      اجبرهُ <br>\

      اجتبر is syn. with انتعش (tropical:)  [<i>he recovered,</i> or <i>became recovered, from his embarrassment,</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (A.)
