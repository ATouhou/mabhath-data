      اجلب; <i>He threatened with evil;</i> (K, TA;) followed by an accus. (TA) [or, app., by عَلَى before the object]: or (so in the TA, but in some copies of the K “ and, ”) <i>he collected a company, a troop,</i> or <i>an army.</i> (K, TA.) [It is said that] عَلَيْهِمْ ↓ <br>\
      وَاَجْلِبْ, in the Kur [xvii. 66], means <i>And collect thou against them</i> [<i>thy forces</i>], <i>and threaten them with evil.</i> (TA. But see another explanation above.) And عَلَيْهِ ↓ <br>\
      اجلبو signifies also <i>They collected themselves together against him,</i> (S, K, *) <i>and aided one another;</i> like احلبوا. (S.) ―         -b3-  جَلَبَ <br>\

                  : see 1, in eleven places, in the latter half of the paragraph.       -A2-  Also <i>His camels brought forth males;</i> (S, K;) because the males that they produce are driven, or brought, from one place to another, and sold; opposed to احلب “ his camels brought forth females: ” (S:) and <i>his camel brought forth a male.</i> (TA.) اَجْلَبْتَ <br>\

                  <i>May thy camels bring forth males, and may they not bring forth females,</i> is a form of imprecation against a man, implying a wish that he may lose the milk [that he would have otherwise].
