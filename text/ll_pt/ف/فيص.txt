                  , aor. يَفِيصُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. فَيْصٌ, (TA,) <i>He went away into the country,</i> or <i>in the land.</i> (S, O, K.) In the following verse of Imra-el-Keys, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        مَنَابِتُهُ مِثْلُ السُّدُوسِ وَلَوْنُهُ<br>\

                  </quote> respecting which As said, I know not what is [the meaning of] يَفِيضُ, this word is said to be from فاص signifying as expl. above: (S, O:) [but I do not see what meaning that would be apposite in this case could be thence derived without straining:] but فاص signifies also <i>it shone,</i> or <i>glistened;</i> syn. بَرَقَ; (TA;) and some say that يفيص in this verse means يَبْرُقُ; (O, TA;) and the pronoun in مَنَابِتُهُ relates to the front teeth; (O, * TA;) by عَذْبٌ يَفِيضُ being meant the lustre (مَا=ء) thereof: (O:) [accordingly, the verse may be rendered, <i>The places of growth thereof,</i> i. e. <i>their gums,</i> were <i>like the</i> (<i>garment called</i>) سُدُوس, <i>and their colour</i> was <i>like the thorns of the</i> <br>\
                  سَيَال (q. v.), <i>so that they were sweet</i> and <i>glistening:</i> (see the context in “ the Divans of the six ancient Arabic poets, ” edited by Prof. Ahlwardt:) or, as some relate the verse, the last word is ↓ <br>\
      يُفِيصُ, (IB, O, TA,) from مَا اَفَاصَ <br>\
                  بِكَلِمَةٍ [q. v.], (O,) so that it is a denotative of state, the meaning being عَذْبٌ فِي حَالِ كَلَامِهِ [i. e. <i>sweet when</i> [displayed in] <i>speaking;</i> or rather, <i>clearly uttering;</i> but it will be seen below that يَفِيصُ, as well as يُفِيصُ, may, accord. to the M and K, be used in this sense:] (IB, TA:) see 4. ―         -b2-  مَا اْسْتَطَعْتُ اَنْ اَفِيصَ مِنْهُ, meaning <i>I was not able to turn aside,</i> or <i>away, from,</i> or <i>to avoid, him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (S, O.) [See also مَفِيصٌ: and see 4.] ―         -b3-  And وَاْللّٰه مَا فِصْتُ, like as one says واللّٰه ما <br>\
                  بَرِحْتُ [perhaps meaning <i>By God I did not quit my place;</i> as well as <i>I did not cease:</i>] (S, O, K: *) mentioned on the authority of AHeyth: (TA:) [that it has the latter meaning is clear; for] one says, مَا فِصْتُ اَفْعَلُ <br>\
                  <i>I did not cease</i> (مَا بَرِحْتُ) <i>doing</i> [such a thing]: (M:) and ↓ <br>\

                  <i>I grasped him and he did not escape,</i> or <i>get loose.</i> (AHeyth, TA.) And قَبَضْتُ <br>\

                  ضبّ <br>\
                  <i>and it slipped from my hand so that it freed its tail</i>]: (Lth, S, O, TA:) [but in the O, مِنْ is omitted before يَدِى; not intentionally, for the verb before من is there masc., as above:]) this is when thy fingers become unclosed (تَتَفَرَّجُ) from the grasp of its tail: (Lth, O:) and this [state of the fingers] is termed ↓ <br>\
      التَّفَاوُصُ. (TA.) [It is also said that] اَفَاصَتِ اليَدُ signifies <i>The fingers of the hand became unclosed</i> (تَفَرَّجَتْ) <i>from the grasp of the thing.</i> (K, TA. [But I doubt the correctness of this.]) ―         -b2-  And الاـِفَاصَةُ signifies <i>The being clear,</i> or <i>perspicuous;</i> syn. البَيَانُ; (O, K;) like المُفَاوَصَةُ, expl. in art. فوص;] and <i>the being fluent.</i> (O.) [And also <i>The making</i> speech <i>clear,</i> or <i>perspicuous.</i>] One says, فُلَانٌ ذُو اـِفَاصَةٍ <br>\

[And it is said that مَا اَفَاضَ بِكَلِمَةٍ signifies the same. Or, accord. to Mtr, if he be correctly cited in Har p. 447, the verb in this sense, and app. as thus used in all the phrases mentioned above, is correctly with ض, and not so with ص: but this I greatly doubt.] ―         -b3-  One says also, افاص بِبَوْلِهِ <br>\
                  <i>He ejected his urine:</i> (O, K:) or افاض به. (ElGhooree, in Har ubi suprà.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                   is said to be the original and regular form of التَّفَاوُصُ, which signifies <i>The speaking, talking,</i> or <i>discoursing, each to another,</i> or <i>each with another:</i> the ى being changed into و because of the dammeh.
