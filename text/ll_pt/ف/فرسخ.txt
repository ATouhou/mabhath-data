                  , mentioned, but not explained, by J [in the S], (K,) [<i>A parasang,</i> or <i>league;</i>] <i>three Háshimee miles</i> (اَمْيَال هَاشِمِيَّة [see مِيلٌ]): or <i>twelve thousand cubits:</i> or <i>ten thousand cubits:</i> (K:) <i>three miles of the Háshimee measure,</i> i. e., accord. to the Bári&#39; and the T [&amp;amp;c.], <i>twenty-five bow-shots; twenty-five times the measure termed</i> <br>\
                  غَلْوَةٌ [q. v.]: (Msb:) or <i>three miles,</i> i. e. <i>thirty bow-shots reckoning the bow-shot as four hundred cubits,</i> or <i>sixty bow-shots reckoning the bow-shot as two hundred cubits:</i> (Msb voce مَيلٌ:) the ancient Greeks said that it is <i>three miles, reckoning these</i> [<i>together</i>] <i>as about sixty bow-shots</i> [<i>of the shorter measure mentioned above</i>]: (Msb in the present art.:) or, accord. to some, <i>six miles:</i> (L: [but this is app. a mistake occasioned by finding it expl. as consisting of sixty bow-shots and supposing these to be bow-shots of four hundred cubits each:]) it is [said to be] from the same word as signifying “ rest, ” or “ ease; ” (K, TA;) because, when a man walks the distance thus called, he sits down, and rests: or, accord. to the Msb, from فَرْسَخَةٌ signifying “ width; ” the word having this meaning, however, is فَرْشَخَةٌ, with ش: (TA:) [the truth is, that] it is a Pers. word [فَرْسَنْگ], arabicized: (S, A:) the pl. is فَرَاسِخُ. (S, A, Msb.) The other meanings of this word, not mentioned by J, may have been regarded by him as not of established authority. (TA.) ―         -b2-  It signifies also <i>An opening,</i> or <i>intervening space, between two things.</i> (K.) ―         -b3-  And <i>A thing in which is no opening,</i> or <i>intervening space:</i> as though having two contr. significations. (K.) ―         -b4-  Also <i>A thing that is lasting and abundant, that does not cease,</i> or <i>come to an end.</i> (ISh, K.) ―         -b5-  And <i>A long time</i> (K, TA) <i>of the night</i> or <i>of the day:</i> thus in the saying, اِنْتَظَرْتُكَ <br>\
                  فَرْسَخًا [<i>I looked,</i> or <i>waited, for thee,</i> or <i>I have looked,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>a long time</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (TA.) ―         -b6-  And <i>A</i> <br>\
                  سَاعَة [meaning <i>hour</i> or <i>time</i>] (K, TA) of the day: or <i>a time</i> of the night and of the day: pl. as above. (TA.) ―         -b7-  And The <i>time,</i> (K, TA,) or <i>interval,</i> (TA,) <i>between stillness and motion.</i> (K, TA.) ―         -b8-  And <i>Stillness,</i> or <i>quiet:</i> (K, TA:) a meaning mentioned by more than one of the authorities respecting strange words. (TA.) ―         -b9-  And <i>Rest,</i> or <i>ease.</i> (K.)   </entryFree> <br>\
