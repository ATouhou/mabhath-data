                  , (M,) inf. n. فَتْنٌ, (S, M, K,) [and quasi-inf. n., in this and other senses, فِتْنَةٌ,] <i>He burned it</i> (T, * S, * M, K *) in the fire. (M.) Hence, [in the Kur li. 13,] يَوْمَ هُمْ عَلَى اْلنَّارِ يُفْتَنُونَ (T, * S, M, K *) i. e. [<i>The day,</i> or <i>on the day,</i> accord. to two different readings, (يَوْمُ and يَوْمَ, the latter of which is the more common,)] <i>when they shall be burned</i> (T, S, M, K) <i>with the fire</i> [of Hell]. (T.) And [in the Kur lxxxv. 10,] اـِنَّ اْلَّذِينَ فَتَنُوا اْلْمُوْمِنِينَ <br>\
                  وَاْلْمُوْمِنَاتِ <br>\
                  <i>Verily they who burned the believing men and the believing women</i> (T, S *) in the fire kindled in the trench, or pit; throwing them therein. (T.) This is said to be the primary signification of the verb. (TA.) ―         -b2-  And <i>He melted it with fire,</i> (T,) or <i>put it into the fire,</i> (S, Msb,) namely, gold, (T, S, Msb,) and silver, <i>in order to separate,</i> or <i>distinguish,</i> (T, Msb,) <i>the bad from the good,</i> (T,) or <i>the good from the bad,</i> (Msb,) or <i>to see what was its</i> [<i>degree of</i>] <i>goodness.</i> (S.) ―         -b3-  And hence, accord. to Er-Rághib, الفَتْنُ is used as meaning <i>The causing</i> a man <i>to enter into fire</i> [app. <i>by way of trial,</i> or <i>probation</i>], and [<i>in like manner</i>] <i>into a state of punishment,</i> or <i>affliction:</i> (TA:) [and it is also used as meaning <i>the slaying</i> another; whence, in the Kur iv. 102,] اـِنْ <br>\
                  خِفْتُمْ اَنْ يَفْتِنَكُمُ اْلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا means [<i>If ye fear that those who have disbelieved</i>] <i>may slay you;</i> and in like manner in the Chapter of Yoonus [i. e. in x. 83], اَنْ يَفْتِنَهُمْ means ان يَقْتُلَهُمْ. (T. [In the TA, these two exs. are misplaced, or something has been omitted before them by a copyist.]) ―         -b4-  [Hence also,] one says, فَتَنَهُ, aor.      <br>\

                  , (K, TA,) inf. n. فَتْنٌ, (TA,) <i>He,</i> or <i>it, caused him to fall into</i> <br>\
                  الفِتْنَة; (K, TA;) i. e. <i>trial;</i> and <i>affliction, distress,</i> or <i>hardship;</i> [generally meaning <i>an affliction whereby some good or evil quality is put to the test;</i>] (TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
      اِفْتَتَنَهُ; and ↓ <br>\
      فتّنهُ; (K, TA;) but this, of which the inf. n. is تَفْتِينٌ, has an intensive signification; (S;) and ↓ <br>\
      اَفْتَنَهُ; (K, TA;) which last is rare, or rather, accord. to As, [though app. not in this sense, but in another, to be mentioned in what follows,] is not allowable: (TA:) the first of these verbs is trans. and intrans.: (S, K, TA:) you say also, فَتَنَ, (AZ, T, S, K, TA,) aor.      <br>\
                     فَتِنَ<br>\
                  , (AZ, T, K,) inf. n. فُتُونٌ, (AZ, T, S, TA,) <i>He fell into</i> <br>\

                  <i>trial,</i> or <i>affliction,</i> &amp;amp;c.]; (AZ, T, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      اِفْتَتَنَ: (K:) or the former signifies <i>he shifted from a good, to an evil, state</i> or <i>condition:</i> or, accord. to En-Nadr, one says ↓ <br>\
      اِفْتَتَنَ and اُفْتُتِنَ, both meaning the same; and this is correct; but فَتَنَ as quasi-pass. of فَتَنْتُهُ [i. e. as intrans.] is of weak authority: (T:) and ↓ <br>\
      اُفْتُتِنَ, said of a man, [as also اِفْتَتَنَ,] and فُتِنَ, signify the same, (S, M,) accord. to AZ, (M,) i. e. <i>he was smitten by a</i> <br>\
                  فِتْنَة [or <i>trial,</i> &amp;amp;c.,] <i>so that his wealth,</i> or <i>property,</i> or <i>his intellect, departed:</i> and likewise <i>he was tried,</i> or <i>tested:</i> (S:) and accord. to AZ, one says, of a man, ↓ <br>\
      اُفْتِنَ, [if not a mistranscription for اُفْتُتِنَ, as above,] with damm, meaning فُتِنَ: (TA:) [and فَتَنَهُ has فُتُونٌ also as an inf. n.:] it is said in the Kur [xx. 41], وَفَتَنَّاكَ <br>\
                  فُتُونًا (S) i. e. <i>And we tried thee with a</i> [<i>severe</i>] <i>trying:</i> or the noun in this instance is pl. of فَتْنٌ; or of فِتْنَةٌ, formed by disregard of the ة, like حُجُوزٌ and بُدُورٌ which are [said to be] pls. of حُجْزَةٌ and بَدْرَةٌ; so that the <i>meaning is, we tried thee with several sorts of trying:</i> (Bd:) or, as some say, <i>and we purified thee with a</i> [<i>thorough</i> or <i>an effectual</i>] <i>purifying</i> [<i>like that of gold,</i> or <i>silver, by means of fire</i>]: (TA:) [in many instances] فَتَنَهُ, aor.      <br>\
                     فَتِنَ<br>\
                  , [inf. n. فَتْنٌ,] signifies <i>He tried,</i> or <i>tested, him;</i> whence, in the Kur ix. 127, يُفْتَنُونَ means <i>They are tried,</i> or <i>tested,</i> by being summoned to war, against unbelievers or the like; or, as some say, by the infliction of punishment or of some evil thing. (M.) فَتَنْتُمْ اَنْفُسَكُمْ, in the Kur [lvii. 13], means <i>Ye caused yourselves to fall into trial and punishment.</i> (TA.) And وَهُمْ لَا يُفْتَنُونَ, in the Kur xxix. 1, is expl. as meaning <i>While they are not tried in their persons and their possessions so that he who has true faith may be known from others by his patient endurance of trial.</i> (T.) And the saying, in a trad., اـِنَّكُمْ تُفْتَنُونَ فِى القُبُورِ means [<i>Verily ye shall be tried,</i> or <i>tested, in the graves by</i>] <i>the questioning of</i> [<i>the two angels</i>] <i>Munkar and Nekeer.</i> (TA.) [See also مَفْتُونٌ, which is said to be an inf. n., and syn. with فِتْنَةٌ, meaning خِبْرَةٌ, or with فُتُونٌ (mentioned above as an inf. n. of the intrans. v. فَتَنَ), meaning جُنُونٌ; as well as a pass. part. n.] ―         -b5-  And فَتَنَهٌ, (M, TA,) inf. n. فَتْنٌ, (TA, [or perhaps فُتُونٌ, as in the next following sentence]) also signifies <i>He made him</i> (a man, M) <i>to turn from,</i> or <i>quit,</i> (M, TA,) <i>the predicament in which he was,</i> (M,) or <i>the right course:</i> (TA:) whence, in the Kur [xvii. 75], وَاـِنْ كَادُوا لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ عَنِ اْلَّذِى اَوْحَيْنَا <br>\
                  اـِلَيْكَ (M, TA) i. e. [<i>And verily they were near to</i>] <i>their making thee to turn</i> [<i>from that which we had revealed to thee</i>]: thus this saying has been explained. (TA.) [And <i>He,</i> or <i>it, seduced him;</i> or <i>tempted him:</i> thus it may often be well rendered, agreeably with what next precedes and what next follows, and with explanations of its act. part. n. and of فِتْنَةٌ.] And one says, فَتَنَ <br>\
                  المَالُ النَّاسَ, aor.      <br>\
                     فَتِنَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. فُتُونٌ, [or perhaps فَتْنٌ, as in the next preceding sentence,] meaning <i>Wealth,</i> or <i>property, inclined,</i> or <i>attracted, to it, men,</i> or <i>mankind:</i> and فُتِنَ فِى دِينِهِ and ↓ <br>\
      اُفْتُتِنَ, both in the pass. form, <i>He declined</i> [or <i>was made to decline</i>] <i>from</i> [<i>the right way in</i>] <i>his religion.</i> (Msb.) And فَتَنَهُ, aor,      <br>\
                     فَتِنَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. فَتْنٌ and فُتُونٌ, (M, K,) <i>He,</i> or <i>it induced in him admiration,</i> or <i>pleasure;</i> (M, * K, * TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
      اَفْتَنَهُ [respecting which see what here follows]: (M, K:) and one says, of a woman, فَتَنَتْهُ, (T, S,) meaning [<i>She enamoured him;</i> or <i>captivated his heart;</i> i. e.] <i>she bereaved him of his heart,</i> or <i>reason,</i> (دَلَّهَتْهُ, [thus in several copies of the S, in one of my copies بَلَّهَتْهُ,] <i>and</i> [<i>so affected him that</i>] <i>he loved her;</i> (S;) as also ↓ <br>\
      اَفْتَنَتْهُ; (T, S;) the former of the dial. of El-Hijáz, and the latter of the dial. of Nejd; (T, S; *) but ↓ <br>\
      افتنتهُ, (T, S,) or افتنهُ, (M,) was disallowed by As, (T, S, M,) and he paid no regard to a verse mentioned to him as an ex. thereof, (T,) [or] he ignored a verse cited to him as an ex. of the pass. part. n. from an اُرْجُوزَة of Ru-beh, not knowing it therein; (M;) most of the lexicologists, however, allow both: (T:) Sb says that فَتَنَهُ signifies <i>he put</i> [or <i>occasioned</i>] <i>in him</i> <br>\
                  فِتْنَة; and ↓ <br>\
      افتنهُ, <i>he caused</i> <br>\
                  الفِتْنَة <br>\
                  <i>to come to him</i> [or <i>to affect him</i>]; (M;) or he said that the latter means <i>he made him to be</i> <br>\
                  فَاتِن: (TA voce حَزَنَهُ:) and one says also, of a man, فُتِنَ باْلْمَرْاَةِ and ↓ <br>\
      اُفْتُتِنَ [both meaning <i>He was enamoured by the woman</i>]. (T.) ―         -b6-  And one says also, of a man, فَتَنَ, aor.      <br>\
