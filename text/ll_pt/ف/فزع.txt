                  , of the former verb, (Msb, K,) and of the latter also, (K,) inf. n. فَزَعٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) which is of the former verb, (S, * O, Msb, TA,) and [of the latter verb] فَزْعٌ [فَزَعًا in the CK being a mistake for فَزْعًا] and ؟؟ (K, TA,) <i>He feared;</i> or <i>was,</i> or <i>became, in fear, afraid, frightened,</i> or <i>terrified;</i> (S, O, Msb, K, TA;) and so ↓ <br>\
      تفزّع: (TA in art. روع:) you say, فَزِعَ مِنْهُ <br>\
                  <i>he feared him,</i> or <i>it;</i> or <i>was,</i> or <i>became, in fear,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>of him,</i> or <i>it:</i> (MA, Msb, TA:) accord. to Er-Rághib, فَزَعٌ signifies <i>a shrinking,</i> and <i>an aversion,</i> that comes upon a man, <i>from a thing causing fear</i> or <i>fright;</i> and is <i>a kind of</i> <br>\
                  جَزَع [q. v.]; and one should not say فَزِعْتُ مِنَ اْللّٰهِ like as one says خِفْتُ مِنْهُ: or, as Mbr says, in the “ Kámil, ” its primary signification is the <i>fearing,</i> or <i>being in fear</i> or <i>afraid</i> or <i>frightened</i> or <i>terrified:</i> then, by a metonymical application, it signifies a people&#39;s <i>going forth quickly to repel an enemy,</i> or <i>the like, that has come</i> upon them <i>suddenly;</i> and this meaning has become [conventionally regarded as] proper. (TA.) ―         -b2-  فَزَعٌ signifies also The <i>seeking,</i> or <i>demanding, aid,</i> or <i>succour:</i> (Az, K, TA:) and the <i>aiding,</i> or <i>succouring;</i> (Az, S, O, K, TA;) this latter being likewise a signification of ↓ <br>\
      اـِفْزَاعٌ: (S, O:) an ex. of the former word (S, O, TA) in the latter sense (O, TA) occurs in the saying of the Prophet to the Ansár, اـِنَّكُمْ لَتَكْثُرُونَ عِنْدَ الفَزَعِ <br>\
                  وَ تَقِلُّونَ عِنْدَ الطَّمَعِ [<i>Verily ye are many on the occasion of aiding,</i> or <i>succouring, and ye are few on the occasion of coveting,</i> or <i>greed</i>]; (S, O, TA;) or in this saying the implied meaning may be, <i>on the occasion of men&#39;s betaking themselves to you in fear</i> (عِنْدَ فَزَعِ النَّاسِ اـِلَيْكُمْ) <i>in order that ye may aid</i> or <i>succour them</i> [which is virtually the same as <i>their seeking your aid</i> or <i>succour</i>]: (TA:) thus [it is said] فَزَعٌ has two contr. significations: (K:) and both of these significations are expressed by the verb فَزِعَ: (O:) you say فَزِعَ اـِلَيْهِ and فَزِعَ <br>\
                  مِنْهُ; (K in continuation of what has been last cited therefrom above, and TA; [app. meant to indicate that both of these phrases signify <i>he sought,</i> or <i>demanded, aid,</i> or <i>succour, of him;</i> and <i>he aided,</i> or <i>succoured, him;</i> or that the former phrase has the former signification; and the latter phrase, the latter signification; though accord. to the TK, both phrases have the former signification, and the former phrase has also the latter signification;]) but you should not say فَزَعَهُ, (K, TA,) i. e. like مَنَعَهُ: (TA:) [or] from الفَزَعُ as signifying “ fear, ” or “ fright, ” you say فَزِعْتُ <br>\
                  اـِلَيْكَ and فَزِعْتُ مِنْكَ; [app. meant to indicate that the former phrase signifies <i>I betook myself to thee in fear,</i> which is a meaning thereof well known, and nearly agreeing with an explanation of the verb followed by اـِلَيْهِ which will be found below in this paragraph; and that the latter phrase signifies <i>I feared thee,</i> or <i>I was,</i> or <i>became, in fear,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>of thee,</i> the only meaning, of this phrase, for which I find any explicit authority, and one for which I have given three authorities in the first sentence of this art.;] but you should not say فَزِعْتُكَ: (S: [thus in my copies, فَزِعْتُكَ, not فَزَعْتُكَ:]) or فَزِعَ اـِلَيْهِمْ signifies <i>he sought,</i> or <i>demanded, of them, aid,</i> or <i>succour;</i> and فَزَعَهُمْ and فَزِعَهُمْ signify <i>he aided,</i> or <i>succoured, them,</i> syn. اَغَاثَهُمْ [in the CK اَعانَهُمْ] and نَصَرَهُمْ, like ↓ <br>\
      اَفْزَعَهُمْ: (K, TA:) accord. to IB, فَزِعْتُهُ meaning اَغَثْتُهُ is originally فَزِعْتُ له [primarily signifying <i>I feared,</i> or <i>became in fear</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>for him</i>]; then the ل was dropped; for one says فَزِعْتُهُ and فَزِعْتُ <br>\
                  لَهُ: (TA:) or فَزِعَ, like فَرِحَ, signifies اِنْتَصَرَ: (K: [thus in the copies of the K, and hence in the TA, app. a mistranscription for اِسْتَنْصَرَ, <i>he sought,</i> or <i>demanded, aid,</i> or <i>aid against an enemy:</i>]) and فَزِعَ اـِلَيْهِ <br>\
                  <i>he betook himself,</i> or <i>had recourse, to him,</i> or <i>it, for refuge, protection,</i> or <i>preservation,</i> (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) <i>by reason of fear,</i> or <i>fright,</i> (S,) <i>and sought,</i> or <i>demanded, aid,</i> or <i>succour, by him,</i> or <i>it;</i> whence, in a trad. respecting the eclipse of the sun, فَاْفْزَعُوااـِلَى الصَّلَاة i. e. <i>Then betake yourselves,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>to prayer, and seek,</i> or <i>demand, aid,</i> or <i>succour, by it.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  فَزِعَ مِنْ نَوْمِهِ means <i>He became roused from his sleep;</i> (O, K;) because he who is roused is not free from some fear, or fright: occurring in a trad. in this sense. (O.) And one says, فَزِعْتُ بِمَجِىْءِ فُلَانٍ, meaning <i>I prepared</i> [or <i>roused</i>] <i>myself by reason of the coming of such a one, by a change of state,</i> or <i>condition, like as the sleeper passes from the state of sleeping to that of waking.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  فَزَعَهُ in the phrase فَفَزَعَهُ ↓ <br>\
      فَازَعَهُ means <i>He exceeded him in fear,</i> or <i>fright.</i> (TA.)       -A3-  فُزِعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ: see the next paragraph.    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>He removed from him fear,</i> or <i>fright:</i> (O, in two places:) it is implied by the context in the K that عنه ↓ <br>\
      افزع has this meaning; but in the O and other lexicons it is فَزَّعَ. (TA.) And فُزِّعَ عَنْهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَفْزِيعٌ, (K,) <i>Fear,</i> or <i>fright, was removed from him.</i> (S, K.) It is said in the  Kur [xxxiv. 22], حَتَّى اـِذَافُزِّعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ, meaning <i>Until, when fear,</i> or <i>fright, shall be removed from their hearts:</i> (S, O:) this is the common reading: another reading is فَزَّعَ, i. e. فَزَّعَ اْللّٰهُ: and El-Hasan reads ↓ <br>\
      فُزِعَ: and he says that in this reading and the first, the prep. with its noun are [regarded as supplying the place of the agent and therefore virtually] in the nom. case, as in the phrase سِيرَ عَنِ البَلَدِ: (TA:) some read فُرِّغَ [q. v.]: (O and TA in art. فرغ:) and &#39;Eesà Ibn- &#39;Omar is related to have read اـِذَا اْفْرَنْقَعَ.

      مَفْزُوعٌ; meaning <i>a man put in fear; made afraid; frightened,</i> or <i>terrified.</i> (TA.) And <i>In a state of disquiet, disturbance,</i> or <i>agitation:</i> whence an extraordinary reading, of four readers, in the Kur xxviii. 9, [i. e. فَزِعًا] for فَارِغًا, relating to the heart of the mother of Moses, meaning <i>in a state of disquiet,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>almost quitting its pericardium.</i> (TA.)

(TA.) ―         -b2-  Also <i>Seeking,</i> or <i>demanding, aid,</i> or <i>succour;</i> and Sgh thus explains it [in the O] as used in the verse above mentioned; but Er-Rághib says that this is an explanation of the intended meaning, not of the literal signification: (TA:) and it has also the contr. meaning, <i>aiding,</i> or <i>succouring;</i> thus being trans., though of the measure فَعِلٌ; but it may be altered from ↓ <br>\
