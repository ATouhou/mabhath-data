                  <i>A</i> [<i>basin such as is termed</i>] طَسْت; (M, L, K;) thus it means with the vulgar: (L:) or <i>a</i> <br>\
                  طَسْت <br>\
                  <i>of gold,</i> or <i>of silver:</i> (O:) or the طَسْتَخَان, (T, K,) or طَشْتَخَان, (O, and so in some copies of the K,) [i. e. <i>a large circular tray, of brass</i> or <i>other metal, which serves as a table for food,</i> being generally placed upon a stool, the persons who eat sitting on the floor]; (Lth, T, Z, O, K;) thus it means with the vulgar: (Lth, T, Z, O:) or <i>a</i> <br>\
                  خِوَان [or <i>table upon which food is eaten</i>], <i>made of marble,</i> (Lth, T, S, M, O, K,) by the people of Syria, who thus call it, (Lth, T, O,) or <i>of silver,</i> (T, S, M,) and <i>the like,</i> (S,) or <i>of gold:</i> (M, K:) or <i>of any kind</i> accord. to some: (TA:) or <i>a</i> <br>\
                  جَام [q. v.] <i>of silver,</i> (T, Nh, TA,) or <i>of gold:</i> (Nh, TA:) [but this seems to be virtually a repetition; for it is said that] ↓ <br>\
      فَاثُورِيَّةٌ, occurring in a verse of Lebeed, means اَخْوِنَةٌ [pl. of pauc. of خِوَانٌ] (T, O) and جَامَاتٌ [which is pl. of جَامٌ accord. to IAar, or of جَامَةٌ accord. to IB, who holds جَامٌ to be likewise a pl. of جَامَةٌ]: (T:) فَاثُورٌ is a word of the people of Syria and ElJezeereh: (M:) and it signifies (S, O, L) in the dial. of the people of El-Jezeereh, (L,) <i>a</i> <br>\
                  مَايِدَة [sometimes meaning <i>table</i> in an absolute sense, but properly one <i>with food upon it</i>]: (S, O, L:) [hence,] one says, هُمْ عَلَى فَاثُورٍ وَاحِدٍ (Lth, T, S, M, O, L, TA) i. e. عَلَى مَايِدَةٍ وَاحِدَةٍ, (S, O, L, TA,) and مَنْزِلَةٍ وَاحِدَةٍ, (S, O, TA,) and بَسَاطٍ <br>\
                  وَاحِدٍ, (O, TA, [in both of which the former word is without any vowel-sign to the ب so that it may be either بَسَاطٍ or بِسَاطٍ,]) or بَسْطٍ واحدٍ, (TT as from the M,) or as though meaning على بساطٍ <br>\
                  واحدٍ, thus expl. by Lth, as said of the people of Syria and El-Jezeereh: (TT as from the T:) [it means, app., <i>They are living upon one kind of fare; upon one footing; upon one level</i> or <i>stratum:</i>] in the copies of the K, [or in the generality of the copies thereof,] الفَاثُورُ is expl. as signifying المَنْزِلَةُ and النَّشَاطُ; but النشاط is a mistake for البساط. (TA. [My MS. copy of the K has the right reading (البساط), without any trace of alteration.]) ―         -b2-  Also (tropical:)  The <i>breast,</i> or <i>bosom:</i> (K:) or <i>a wide breast</i> or <i>bosom;</i> applied by a poet to that of a woman; as being likened to the خِوَان so called. (M.) ―         -b3-  And (tropical:)  The <i>disk</i> of the sun (S, * O, K) is called its فاثور as being likened to the طَسْت so called. (O.) ―         -b4-  And (tropical:)  <i>A</i> [<i>bowl such as is termed</i>] جَفْنَة; (M, K, TA;) thus with [the tribe of] Rabee&#39;ah; (M, TA;) for the like reason. (TA.) ―         -b5-  And <i>A</i> [<i>vessel such as is termed</i>] نَاجُود <br>\
                  <i>and</i> <br>\
                  بَاطِيَة (AA, T, O, K) <i>and</i> <br>\
                  مِصْحَاة; all which words mean the same thing. (AA, O, TA.) ―         -b6-  And, accord. to the R, <i>A</i> [<i>molten piece such as is termed</i>] سَبِيكَة <br>\
                  <i>of silver:</i> and some say, <i>a silver</i> <br>\
