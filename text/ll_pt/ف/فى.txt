                   is a particle governing the gen. case [and used in the manners and senses expl in what here follows]. (T, S, M, Mughnee, K.) ―         -b2-  It relates to a receptacle; (Sb, S, M;) and, when used in a wider sense, to that which has some near resemblance thereto; (Sb, M;) [i. e.,] and also to what is considered as a receptacle: (S:) [in other words,] it denotes inclusion, or inbeing, (Msb, Mughnee, K, TA,) either in relation to place or in relation to time: (Mughnee, K, TA;) properly and tropically. (Msb, Mughnee, TA.) غُلِبَتِ <br>\
                  اْلرُّومُ فِى اَدْنَى اْلْاَرْضِ وَهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ غَلَبِهِمْ سَيَغْلِبُونَ <br>\
                  فِى بِضْعِ سِنِينَ [<i>The Greeks have been overcome in the nearer,</i> or <i>nearest, part of the land, and they, after the overcoming of them, shall overcome in some few years</i>], in the Kur [xxx. 1 — 3], is an ex. of its relation to place and to time. (Mughnee.) And وَلَكُمْ فِى اْلْقِصَاصِ حَيٰوةٌ (tropical:)  [<i>And there is, to you, in retaliation, life,</i> or <i>an advantage,</i> (respecting the meaning of which see art. حى,) in the Kur ii. 175,] is an ex. of its being used tropically, (Mughnee.) اَدْخَلْتُ الخَاتَمَ فِى اُصْبَعِى is an ex. of its relation to place, but the proposition is inverted [i. e. the meaning is <i>I inserted my finger into the signet-ring</i>]. (Mughnee.) [Using it properly,] you say, المَا=ءُ فِى الاـِنَا=ءِ [<i>The water is in the vessel</i>]: (S:) and هُوَ فِى الجِرَابِ [<i>It is in the wallet,</i>] and فِى الكِيسِ [<i>in the purse</i>]: and هُوَ فِى بَطْنِ اُمِّهِ [<i>He is in the belly of his mother</i>]: and هُوَ فِى الغُلِّ [<i>He is in the shackle for the neck</i>]: (M:) and زَيْدٌ فِى الدَّارِ [<i>Zeyd is in the house</i>], (S, M, * Msb,) or <i>within the house,</i> and <i>in the midst of it,</i> for فِى الدَّارِ, means دَاخِلِهَا, and وَسْطَهَا: (T:) and [using it tropically, you say,] الشَّكُّ فِى الخَبَرِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Doubt,</i> or <i>uncertainty, is in the information</i>]. (S.) The saying فِيهِ عَيْبٌ [<i>In him is a fault,</i> or <i>blemish</i>], if relating to a real عَيْب, is proper; and if relating to an ideal عَيْب, tropical: the former is such as the amputation of the hand of the thief, and the redundance of a hand; and the latter, such as the runningaway of a slave. (Msb.) [When relating to time, it may in some cases be rendered <i>In,</i> or <i>during;</i> as in the phrase فِى اَيَّامٍ مَعْدُودَاتٍ, in the Kur ii. 139, i. e. <i>In,</i> or <i>during,</i> certain <i>numbered days.</i> <br>\
                  اـِنَّ اَصْحَابَ اْلْجَنَّةِ اْلْيَوْمَ فِى شُغُلٍ <br>\
                  فَاكِهُونَ, in the Kur xxxvi. 55, may be rendered (assumed tropical:)  <i>Verily the inmates of Paradise this day shall be in the midst of diverting occupation, cheerful,</i> or <i>happy.</i> The phrase اَمَّا قَوْلُهُ كَذَا فِيهِ مَا فِيهِ, lit. (assumed tropical:)  <i>As to his saying thus, in it is what is in it,</i> is used as a polite expression of objection, or contradiction; like فِيهِ تَاَمُّلٌ, q. v. In many instances, فِى may be rendered <i>Of,</i> or <i>concerning,</i> or <i>in respect of;</i> as in قَالَ فِيهِ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  <i>He said of,</i> or <i>concerning, him,</i> or <i>it, thus;</i> for قَالَ فِى ذِكْرِهِ <br>\
                  كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  <i>He said in mentioning him,</i> or <i>it, thus,</i> or فِى وَصْفِهِ <br>\
                  <i>in describing him,</i> or <i>it;</i> or the like hence, for ex., one says كَتَبَ كِتَابًا فِى عِلْمِ اللُّغَةِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He wrote a book of,</i> or <i>concerning the science of lexicology:</i> and hence, in the Kur ii. 133, اَتُّحَاجُّونَنَا <br>\
                  فِى اْللّٰهِ  (assumed tropical:)  <i>Do ye argue with us concerning,</i> or <i>in respect of, God?</i>] ―         -b3-  It also denotes concomitance, (Mughnee, K,) and (K) in this ease (Mughnee) it is syn. with مَعَ. (Msb, Mughnee, K.) Thus in the phrase, قَالَ اْدْخُلُوا فِى اُمَمٍ [<i>He shall say, Enter ye with peoples</i>]. (Msb, Mughnee, TA,) in the Kur [vii. 36]: (Msb, TA:) or, as some say, the meaning is, فِى جَمَاعَةِ اُمَمٍ [<i>in the company of peoples</i>]. (Mughnee.) Thus. too, in the phrase, in the Kur [xlvi. 15], فِى اَصْحَابِ <br>\
                  الجَنَّةِ [<i>With the inmates of Paradise</i>]. (Msb, TA.) [Or in these and similar instances, فِى may be rendered, more agreeably with the primary signification, as meaning <i>Among.</i>] In the K, the meaning as denoting concomitance and that which is identical with مَعَ are made distinct: and it has been said that بِ denotes the continuance of concomitance and مَعَ denotes its commencement; though this is not invariably the case. (MF, TA.) [Hence it is used to denote a combination of two qualities: as in the phrase طُولٌ فِى اْسْتِرْخَا=ءٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Length together with laxness:</i> (occurring in the K voce طَنَبٌ:) and سَوَادٌ فِى حُمْرَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Blackness</i> blending <i>with redness:</i> and the like. And in like manner it is used to denote the combination of the length and breadth of a thing: as in the phrase طُولُهُ عِشْرُونَ ذِرَاعًا فِى ثَلَاثِ اَذْرُعٍ عَرْضًا <br>\
                  <i>Its length is twenty cubits with</i> (or as we say <i>by</i>) <i>three cubits in breadth:</i> in which case the number of square cubits is expressed by the phrase عِشْرُونَ فِى ثَلَاثٍ as though meaning <i>Twenty</i> as a multiplicand <i>with three</i> as its multiplier; i. e. <i>twenty multiplied by three:</i> see ضَرَبَ as signifying “ he multiplied. ”]. ―         -b4-  It also denotes the assigning of a cause. (Msb, Mughnee, K.) Thus in the phrase فِى اَرْبَعِينَ شَاةٌ i. e. <i>On account,</i> or <i>because, of</i> completing [the possession of] <i>forty sheep</i> or <i>goats,</i> [the giving of]  <br>\
                  <i>a sheep</i> or <i>goat</i> [for the poor-rate] is incumbent [on the possessor: or this may be rendered, <i>in the case of</i> the possession <i>of forty, a sheep</i> or <i>goat</i> is to be given]. (Msb.) And thus in the saying, [in the Kur xii. 32,] فَذٰلِكُنَّ اْلَّذِى لُمْتُنَّنِى <br>\
                  فِيهِ [<i>And that is he because of whom ye blamed me</i>]. (Mughnee.) Thus also in the saying, in a trad., اـِنَّ اْمْرَاَةً دَخَلَتِ النَّارَ فِى هِرَّةٍ حَبَسَتْهَا [<i>Verily a woman entered the fire</i> of Hell <i>because of a she-cat which she confined</i> without food]. (Mughnee.) [And thus in the phrase اَسْلَفَ فِى كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>He paid in advance,</i> or <i>beforehand, for,</i> or <i>on account of, such a thing.</i>] ―         -b5-  It also denotes superiority; (Mughnee, K, TA;) i. e. (TA) it is used in the sense of عَلَى. (T, S, M, Msb, TA.) Thus in the saying, in the Kur [xx. 74], وَلَاُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ فِى <br>\
                  جُذُوعِ اْلنَّخْلِ [<i>And I will assuredly crucify you upon the trunks of palm-trees</i>]. (T, S, Msb, Mughnee, TA.) And so in the verse of &#39;Antarah cited voce سَرْحٌ. (T, M, Mughnee, TA.) And Yoo asserts that the Arabs say, نَزَلْتُ فِى اَبِيكَ, meaning عَلَيْهِ [i. e. <i>I alighted,</i> or <i>descended and stopped,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>at the abode of thy father</i>]. (S.) ―         -b6-  It is also <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  بِ, (T, S, M, Mughnee, K,) sometimes. (S.) Thus in the saying of Zeyd-el-Kheyl, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَتَرْكَبُ يَوْمَ الرَّوْعِ فِيهَا فَوَارِسُ<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        بَصِيرُونَ فِى طَعْنِ الاَبَاهِرِ والكُلَى<br>\
                  </quote> (S, Mughnee, TA,) meaning, بِطَعْنِ الاباهر والكلى [i. e. <i>And horsemen skilful in piercing the aortas and the kidneys ride in the day of fear therein</i>]. (S, TA.) And thus in a verse cited by Fr, اَرْغَبُ is made trans. by فِى and عَنْ instead of بِ and عَنْ. (T, TA.) [Thus, also, لَيْسَ فِى شَىْءٍ is sometimes used for لَيْسَ بِشَىْءٍ, meaning <i>It is nought;</i> or <i>not of any account</i> or <i>weight;</i> &amp;amp;c.: see more in art. شيا.] ―         -b7-  It is also <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  اـِلَى. (Mughnee, K.) Thus in the Kur [xiv. 10], فَرَدُّوا <br>\
                  اَيْدِيَهُمْ فِى اَفْوَاههم [<i>And they put their hands to their mouths</i>]. (Mughnee, TA.) ―         -b8-  It is also <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  مِنْ. (M, Mughnee, K, TA.) Thus in the Kur [xxvii. 12], فِى تِسْعِ ا=يَاتٍ [<i>Of,</i> or <i>among, nine signs</i>]. (M, TA.) And in the saying, خُذْ لِى <br>\
                  عَشْرًا مِنَ الاـِبِلِ فِيهَا فَحْلَانِ [<i>Take thou for me ten of the camels; of,</i> or <i>among, them</i> let there be <i>two stallions.</i> (M, TA.) [Thus too in the saying هُوَ فِى اَصْلِ قَوْمِهِ <br>\
                  <i>He is of,</i> or <i>among, the purest in race,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>of his people:</i> and the like thereof.] ―         -b9-  It also denotes comparison; and this is when it occurs between a preceding [mention of a] thing excelled and a following [mention of a] thing excelling: as in the saying, [in the Kur ix. 38,] فَمَا مَتَاعُ اْلْحَيٰوةِ اْلدُّنْيَا فِى اْلْا=خِرَةِ اـِلَّا قَلِيلٌ [<i>But the enjoyment of the present life, in comparison with that which is to come, is no other than little</i>]. (Mughnee, K.) ―         -b10-  It is also used for compensation; and this is when it is redundant as a compensation for another [فِى] which is suppressed: as in the saying, ضَرَبْتُ فِيمَنْ رَغِبْتَ for ضَرَبْتُ مَنْ رَغِبْتَ فِيهِ [<i>I beat,</i> or <i>struck, him whom thou desiredst</i>]: (Mughnee, K:) but this is allowed by Ibn-Málik alone. (Mughnee.) ―         -b11-  And it is used for corroboration: (Mughnee, K:) this is when it is redundant without its being for compensation: and this El-Fárisee allows in a case of necessity in verse; citing as an ex., <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        اَنَا اَبُوا سَعْدٍ اـِذَا اللَّيْلُ دَجَا<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        تَخَالُ فِى سَوَادِهِ يَرَنْدَجَا<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>I am Aboo-Saad; when the night becomes dark, thou imagining its blackness to be black leather</i>]. (Mughnee.) And it is thus used in the saying, in the Kur [xi. 43], وَقَالَ اْرْكَبُوا فِيهَا [for اْرْكَبُوهَا, i. e. <i>And he said, Embark ye therein,</i> the like of which occurs also in xviii. 70 and xxix. 65], (Mughnee, K,) accord. to some. (Mughnee.)       -A2-  فِى as a prefixed noun in the gen. case, <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  فَم, and فِىَّ as <i>syn. with</i> <br>\

<b>فَىَّ</b>               1     <br>\
                     فَىَّ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                   is a word expressive of wonder: they say, يَا فَىَّ مَا لِى اَفْعَلُ كَذَا [<i>O my wonder! What has happened to me that I do thus?</i>]: or it is expressive of regret on account of a thing that is passing away [so that this exclamation may be rendered <i>Oh! What has happened to me</i> &amp;amp;c.]: Ks says that it is not to be written withء [though it is so written in several of the lexicons in art. فيا, i. e. فَىْءَ]; and that it means يَا عَجَبِى [as first expl. above]: and in like manner one says, يَا فَىَّ مَا <br>\
                  اَصْحَابُكَ [<i>O my wonder! What are thy companions?</i> i. e. <i>what manner of men are thy companions?</i> <br>\
                  ما here denoting interrogation respecting qualities, or attributes; as in the Kur xxvi. 22]: and he says that ما in this case occupies the place of a noun in the nom. case. (M, TA.) Ks is also related to have said that some of the Arabs express wonder by فَىَّ and هَىَّ and شَىْءَ; and some add مَا, saying يَا فَيَّمَا and يَا هَيَّمَا and يَا <br>\
                  شَيْيَمَا, meaning <i>How good,</i> or <i>beautiful, is this!</i> the K is faulty here; mentioning only يَا فَيَّمَا, and explaining it as denoting wonder. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
