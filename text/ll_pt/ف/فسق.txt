                   is said to signify primarily <i>It</i> (a thing) <i>went forth,</i> from another thing, <i>in a bad,</i> or <i>corrupt, manner.</i> (Msb.) One says, فَسَقَتِ الرُّطَبَةُ, (S, O, Msb,) or فَسَقَتِ الرُّطَبَةُ عَنْ قِشْرِهَا, (K,) <i>The fresh ripe date came forth from its skin;</i> (S, O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      انفسقت: (IDrd, O, K:) and in like manner فَسَقَ is said of anything as meaning <i>it came forth from its integument:</i> so says EsSarakustee. (Msb.) ―         -b2-  [Hence] فَسَقَ, aor.      <br>\
                     فَسُقَ<br>\

                     فَسِقَ<br>\
                  , (S, O, Msb, K) the latter aor. mentioned by Akh, (S, O, Msb,) inf. n. فُسُوقٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and فِسْقٌ, (S, O, K,) or this latter is a simple subst.; (Msb;) and likewise فَسُقَ, like كَرُمَ, (K, TA,) mentioned by Lh, but not known by Ks; (TA;) <i>He went forth from, departed from,</i> or <i>quitted,</i> (Mgh, Msb, K,) <i>the right way,</i> (Mgh, K,) or <i>the way of truth,</i> (K,) and <i>the limits of the law,</i> (Mgh,) [or <i>the bounds of</i>] <i>obedience;</i> (Msb;) <i>he forsook, relinquished,</i> or <i>neglected, the command of God; he disobeyed;</i> (K;) or <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  فَجَرَ [meaning  as above; or <i>he transgressed;</i> or <i>acted unrighteously, sinfully, wickedly, vitiously,</i> or <i>immorally</i>]. (S, O, K. [See also فِسْقٌ below.]) فَسَقَ عَنْ اَمْرِرَبِّهِ (in the Kur [xviii. 48], O, TA) means <i>He departed</i> (خَرَجَ) <i>from the command of his Lord:</i> (Th, S, O, K:) or <i>from the obeying</i> [<i>of the command</i>] <i>of his Lord:</i> (Fr, O, TA:) and Akh says that this phrase is like اِتَّخَمَ عن الطَّعامِ, (S, O,) meaning عَنْ مَاْكَلِهِ, (S,) or عَنْ اَكْلِهِ الطَّعَامَ; but Th says that there is no need of this [explanation]: or, accord. to AO, it means <i>he declined,</i> or <i>deviated, from obeying the command of his Lord:</i> (O:) for فَسَقَ signifies also <i>he declined,</i> or <i>deviated:</i> (K:) and hence the saying, فَسَقَتِ الرِّكَابُ عَنْ قَصْدِ <br>\
                  السَّبِيلِ i. e. [<i>The ridden camels</i>] <i>declined</i> [<i>from the right direction of the way</i>]. (TA.) Sometimes فُسُوقٌ may mean The <i>believing in a plurality of gods:</i> and it may mean the <i>committing sin.</i> (A Heyth, O.) And it is said to mean The <i>calling one another by names of reproach:</i> (Zj, * Mgh, TA:) or the <i>saying</i> “ <i>O Jew,</i> ” and “ <i>O Christian,</i> ” after one has become a believer: thus in the Kur xlix. 11. (TA.) ―         -b3-  One says also, فَسَقَ فِى <br>\
                  الدُّنْيَا, inf. n. فِسْقٌ, meaning <i>He had a wide,</i> or <i>an ample, range in respect of worldly things, and made them light and easy to himself, being without restraint in his management of them, not making them strait to him.</i> (Ktr, Sh, TA.) ―         -b4-  And فَسَقَ مَالَهُ <br>\
                  <i>He made away with his property;</i> and <i>disposed of it,</i> or <i>spent it.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   is an inf. n., (S, O, K,) or a simple subst., (Msb,) from فَسَقَ [q. v]: (S, O, Msb, K:) unless as signifying [simply] <i>A going forth,</i> or <i>a departure,</i> it is said to be a word unknown before ElIslám, and to have become so much used in its legal acceptation as to be, when so used, conventionally regarded as proper (MF, TA:) [thus used,] it signifies <i>a going forth,</i> or <i>departure, from the right way,</i> (K, TA,) which is said to be the primary meaning, (TA,) or <i>from the way of truth;</i> (K, TA;) or <i>from the truth,</i> or <i>that which is right,</i> as in the phrase وَاـِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ, (O, K, [in the CK لَفَسِقٌ, a strange mistake,]) in the Kur [vi. 121]; (O;) or <i>a relinquishment,</i> or <i>neglect, of the command of God;</i> (Lth, O, K;) and <i>an inclining to disobedience;</i> (Lth, O;) or also <i>disobedience</i> [itself]; (K;) or <i>i. q.</i> <br>\

                  <i>Going forth,</i> or <i>departing,</i> or one <i>who goes forth,</i> or <i>departs,</i> [<i>from the right way,</i> or <i>the way of truth,</i> and <i>the limits of the law,</i> or] <i>from</i> [<i>the bounds of</i>] <i>obedience;</i> (Msb;) <i>disobedient</i> [<i>to God</i>]; (Mgh, TA;) [<i>transgressing,</i> or a <i>transgressor; unrighteous, sinful, wicked, vitious,</i> or <i>immoral;</i>] mostly applied to one <i>who has taken upon himself to observe what the law ordains, and has acknowledged its authority, and then fallen short of observance in respect of all,</i> or <i>of some, of its ordinances:</i> and when the person fundamentally, or utterly, an unbeliever is thus termed, it is because he falls short of observing the ordinance that the intellect renders obligatory on him and that the natural constitution with which he was created in his mother&#39;s womb requires to be conceded; hence the believer is contrasted with him in the Kur xxxii. 18; so فَاسِقٌ is a more general term than كَافِرٌ; and ظَالِمٌ is a more general term than فَاسِقٌ: (El-Isbahánee, TA:) accord. to IDrd, (O,) the فَاسِق is thus called because of his divesting himself, or becoming divested, of good: (O, K:) the word has not been heard in the speech of the people of the Time of Ignorance, (IAar, S, O, Msb, K,) nor in their poetry, (IAar, S, O, K,) though it is an Arabic word, (IAar, S, O, Msb, K,) and a chaste one, and the Kur-án has used it: (IAar, Msb:) the pl. is فَسَقَةٌ and فُسَّاقٌ: (Msb:) فَوَاسِقُ, [pl. of فَاسِقَةٌ,] applied to women, signifies فَوَاجِرُ [generally meaning <i>adulteresses,</i> or <i>fornicatresses</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  The five animals, or living things, (الحَيَوَانَاتُ الخَمْسُ, [specified voce حَيَوَانٌ,]) are metaphorically termed فَوَاسِقُ [as though meaning (tropical:)  <i>Transgressors</i>] (Mgh, Msb) because of their noxiousness, (Mgh,) or because of their much, or frequent, noxiousness and harmfulness, so that they may be killed in the case of freedom from اـِحْرَام and in the state of اـِحْرَام, and in prayer, which is not rendered ineffectual thereby: (Msb:) or because of their being out of the pale of inviolability: or, as some [unreasonably] say, because the eating of them is forbidden.
