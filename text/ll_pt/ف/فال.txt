(S, TA.) ―         -b2-  [It has also another signification:] Fr says, اِفْتَاَلْتُ الرَّاْىَ is with hemz which is originally [a letter] other than hemz [app. meaning that the v. is originally اِفْتَيَلْتُ, which becomes changed by rule to اِفْتَلْتُ; and that the signification is the same as that of فَيَّلْتُ الرَّاْىَ, <i>I declared,</i> or <i>esteemed, the judgment,</i> or <i>opinion, weak;</i> or <i>pronounced it to be bad,</i> and <i>wrong,</i> or <i>erroneous:</i> perhaps the substitution of hemz for the medial radical letter is for the purpose of giving to the phrase a double meaning: or the hemz may be the original letter, and the phrase may be used ironically].
