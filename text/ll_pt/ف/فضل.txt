      فُضُولِىٌّ is formed from it: (Er-Rághib, Msb, TA;) [see this last word, one of the explanations of which shows that a particular meaning of فُضُولٌ is the <i>quality of busying oneself with that which does not concern him:</i>] accord. to Er-Rághib, فَضْلٌ signifies <i>an excess</i> [in respect of a property or quality, or of an acquisition,] <i>above moderateness;</i> and this is of two sorts; such as is commended, as the فضل of knowledge, or science ; and such as is discommended, as the فصل of anger at that whereat it is not necessary: but فَضَلٌ is more used in relation to that which is commended; and [the pl.] فُضُولٌ, in relation to that which is discommended. when the former is used of an excess [in respect of some attribute, of our of two things above the other, it is of three sorts; فضل of kind, as of the animal kind above the vegetable kind; and of species, as of man above other animals; and of the individual, as of one man above another; the first and second of which three are essential attributes, such that he who is deficient in [either of] them cannot do away with his deficiency and acquire فضل, as, <i>for instance,</i> the horse, and the ass, which cannot acquire the excellence (فَضِيلَة) of the human being; but the third may be accidental, such that the way may be found to acquire it, and of this sort are ability, wealth, rank or station, and power: and it signifies also <i>any gift whereof the giving to the recipient thereof is not obligatory:</i> [i. e. <i>a free gift,</i> or gratuity; and <i>an act of bounty</i> or <i>grace; a favour; a benefit;</i> and <i>bounty</i> as an abstract term;] as in the saying [in the Kur iv. 36], وَاْسْاَلُوا <br>\

      لِلْفَضِيلِ ↓ <br>\
      الفَضْلَةُ i. e. <i>The remaining portion</i> of the wine or beverage [<i>is for the excel-lent</i>]. (TA.) It is said in a trad., لَا يُمْنَعُ فَضْلُ <br>\
                  المَا=ءِ لِيُمْنَعَ بِهِ الكَلَاُ [<i>The redundance of water shall not be denied that the herbage be thereby denied</i>]: (TA, in the present art.:) meaning that when there is a well in the desert, with herbage near it, and a person prevents others from drawing water, he thereby prevents the latter from availing themselves of the herbage; for when a man comes with his camels, and pastures them upon that herbage, and does not then water them, thirst kills them. (TA in art كلا,) And it is said in another trad., فَضْلُ الاـِزَارِ فِى النَّارِ [<i>The redundant portion of the waist-wrapper is in the fire</i> of Hell]; meaning what one drags [thereof] upon the around, by reason of pride. (TA;) And one says, فِى يَدِهِ فَضْلُ الزِّمَامِ, meaning [<i>In his hand is</i>] <i>the end of the</i> <br>\

      الفضُولِ, with damm and with fet-h, [<i>The thing having redundant portions</i>] is the name of the coat of mail of the Prophet, which was thus called because having redundance and ampleness. (TA.) فُضُولُ <br>\
                  الغَنَايِمِ means <i>The remains of the spoils when they are divided</i> (TA;) such as a single horse, or a single camel (KL.) And by the فُضُول of women are meant The <i>remains of the menstrual discharge</i> (Ham p. 107: see, there, explanations of a verse in which this occurs.)

                  فضول, a word which is here of uncertain meaning,] is thus explained: Háshim and Zuhrah and Teym [accord. to the CK Teymà] went in to &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-Jud&#39;án, and united in a confederacy to repel wrongdoing, and to exact the due from the wrongdoer; and it was thus called because they bound themselves by their confederacy not to leave in the possession of any one aught remaining [of property] whereof he aught despond any one, without their taking it for him [i. e. the latter] from him [i. e. the former] (O, K, TA: [in the CK, يَظْلِمُهُ اَحَدٌ is a mistake for يظلمه <br>\
                  اَحَدًا:]) or it was thus called as being likened to a confederacy, or covenant, which was made of old, at Mekkeh, in the days of Jurhum, to act with mutual equity, and to take for the weak from the strong, and for the stranger from the resident, and in which three men, every one of whom was named El-Fadl, joined: and it was also called that of the مَطَيَّبُون.
