                  , (O, Msb, K,) inf. n. فَشَلٌ; (S, O, Msb;) a verb of which exs. occur in the Kur iii. 118 and viii. 48; and فَشَلَ, aor.      <br>\

                  ; two dial. vars., the former of these agreeable with a reading of the latter verse of the Kur-án, and the latter agreeable with a reading of the same verse by El- Hasan El-Basree; (O;) <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, cowardly,</i> (S, O, Msb, K,) and <i>weak,</i> (O, K,) or <i>weak-hearted,</i> (Msb,) and <i>flagging, remiss,</i> or <i>languid,</i> (K,) and <i>timorous.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  فَشَلَتْ, and فَشَلَتْ مِفْشَلَهَا, (O,) or فَشَلَتْ فِشْلَهَا, (K, * TA, [in the CK ↓ <br>\
      فَشَّلَتْهُ, the pronoun relating to الفِشْل,]) inf. n. فَشْلٌ; (TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      اِفْتَشَلَتْهُ, (O, K, * TA,) thus accord. to the M as well as the O, (TA,) i. e. مِفْشَلَهَا, (O,) or فِشْلَهَا; (TA;) [in the K اِفْتَشَلَتْ alone, i. e. without any complement, as though it were intrans.; or ↓ <br>\
      افشلت, which is said in the TA to be the reading in the copies of the K, but which I have not found in any;] and ↓ <br>\
      تفشّلت [mentioned without any complement, as though intrans.]; (K, TA;) said of a woman, (O, K, TA,) in relation to the فِشْل, (K,) which is also called مِفْشَل, (IAar, O,) meaning <i>She hung a</i> <br>\
                  ثَوْب [or <i>piece of cloth</i>] (thus in the O, in the TA <i>her</i> <br>\
                  ثوب,) <i>upon the</i> [<i>camel-vehicle called</i>] هَوْدَج, <i>then put it</i> [or <i>drew it,</i> or <i>the main part thereof,</i>] <i>within it, and bound its extremities to the</i> <br>\
                  قَوَاعِد [or <i>four pieces of wood that form a square frame upon which it is fixed</i> (see its sing. قَاعِدَةٌ)]; this being [beneath her (see فِشْلٌ) so as to be to her] a preservative from the heads of the [curved pieces of wood called] اَحْنَا=ء [pl. of حِنْوٌ q. v.] and the [apparatus called] اَقْتَاب [pl. of قِتْبٌ q. v.] and the knots of the cord called عُصْم [pl. of عِصَامٌ q. v.]: (O, TA:) so says ISh.

                  , said of water, <i>It flowed.</i> (S, O, K.)       -A2-  And <i>He took a wife</i> (ISh, O, K) مِنْهُمْ [<i>from among them,</i> probably meaning persons not of his own kindred: see مِفْشَلٌ]. (ISh, O.)       -A3-  See also 1.    </entryFree> <br>\

                     فَشْلٌ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>Weak;</i> (S, O, K;) or <i>weak-hearted;</i> (Msb;) <i>cowardly;</i> (S, Msb, K;) <i>flagging, remiss,</i> or <i>languid;</i> (K;) and accord. to the K, ↓ <br>\
      فَشِلٌ signifies the same, and one says, رَجُلٌ خَشْلٌ فَشْلٌ and ↓ <br>\
      خَشِلٌ فَشِلٌ; but [SM says that] this is a mistake, and [incorrectly] taken from a passage of the M, in which it is stated that one says رَجُلٌ <br>\
                  خَشْلٌ فَشْلٌ and خَسْل فَسْلٌ; i. e., with ش in both and with س in both; not that it is with fet-h in both and like كَتِفٌ: (TA:) [I find, however, ↓ <br>\
      خَشِلٌ فَشِلٌ mentioned in art. خشل in the K, and also, as from Ibn-&#39;Abbád, in the same art. in the O; and as ↓ <br>\
      فَشِلٌ is agreeable with a general rule as part. n. of فَشِلَ, I think it probably correct;] the pl. is اَفْشَالٌ, (S,) or فُشْلٌ, (K,) or both. (TA.) In the following verse, occurring in a trad. respecting the prayer for rain, (O, TA,) uttered to the Prophet by an Arab of the desert, (O,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\

                  </quote> by العِلْهِزِ الفَشْلِ is meant العِلْهِزِ الفَشْلِ ا=كِلُهُ <br>\
                  وَمُدَّخِرُهُ, i. e. الضَّعِيفِ; (O, TA; *) the phrase being like الشَّجَرَةَ المَلْعُونَةَ in the Kur [xvii. 62], i. e., ا=كِلُوهَا: [so that the verse means, <i>And there  is nothing, of what men eat, in our possession, save the colocynth that is a year old, and therefore dry,</i> or <i>that has been laid up for the year of drought</i> or <i>barrenness, and the food made of blood and the fur of camels, the eater, and the storer, whereof is weak</i>]: (O, TA:) but it is also related with س, [i. e. الفَسْلِ,] and thus does not need any paraphrastic interpretation.
