                  اِنْكَسَرَ [accord. to the TK used in its proper sense as signifying <i>It broke,</i> or <i>became broken:</i> but for this I find no authority]. (T, O, K.) So in the saying, انفثّ <br>\
                  الرَّجُلُ مِنْ هَمٍّ اَصَابَهُ [<i>The man became broken in spirit,</i> or <i>languid, from anxiety,</i> or <i>solicitude, that befell him</i>]. (T, O.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>A certain plant, the grain of which is made into bread,</i> (S, M, O, K,) <i>and eaten,</i> (S, M, O,) <i>in the time of drought,</i> or <i>dearth:</i> (S, M, O, K:) in some of the copies of the K, يُخْتَبَاُ is put for يُخْتَبَزُ: (M, F:) <i>the bread made of it is coarse,</i> or <i>thick, resembling the bread that is baked in hot ashes</i> [which is generally made in the form of thick round cakes]: (S, O:) <i>a grain resembling</i> [<i>the species of millet called</i>] جَاوَرْس, <i>which is made into bread, and eaten:</i> (IAar, T:) it is <i>a wild grain, which the Arabs of the desert take, in the</i> <br>\
                  <i>times of hunger, and pound,</i> or <i>bruise, and make into bread; and it is a bad kind of food, but sometimes,</i> or <i>often, they are content with it for days:</i> (T:) or, as some say, it is [<i>a plant</i>] <i>of the species called</i> <br>\
                  نَجِيل, <i>growing in salt lands, of the</i> [<i>plants termed</i>] حُمُوض [pl. of حَمْض], <i>of which bread is made:</i> [a coll. gen. n.:] n. un. فَثَّةٌ: (Th, M:) Aboo-Ziyád El-Kilábee says, the فَثّ, like the دُعَاع, is <i>a herb</i> (بَقْلَة) <i>in which comes forth grain, and each of them spreads</i> [<i>upon the ground</i>], <i>not growing up high; and when they become dry, the people collect what is dry thereof, then pound,</i> or <i>bruise, it, and winnow it, and take forth from it a sort of black grain, with which they fill sacks, and lade the camels: it is a black sort of grain like the</i> <br>\

                  عَصِيدَة (يَعْتَصِدُونَ): (O:) in the Bári&#39; it is said to be <i>a species of tree</i> or <i>plant</i> (شَجَرٌ) <i>growing in the plain,</i> or <i>soft, lands, and on the</i> [<i>eminences called</i>] ا=كَام, <i>having a sort of grain like the</i> <br>\
                  حِمَّص [or <i>chick-peas</i>], <i>of which are made bread and</i> <br>\
                  سَوِيق. (Msb.) ―         -b2-  And accord. to IF, الفَثُّ signifies <i>The</i> <br>\
                  هَبِيد, (O, Msb,) meaning <i>the pulp of the colocynth,</i> <br>\
                  شَحْمُ الحَنْظَلِ, (O,) or <i>the colocynth-plant,</i> <br>\
                  شَجَرُ الحَنْظَلِ. (Msb: and this is one of the meanings assigned to الفَثُّ in the K. [In the TK, شَحْمُ الحَنْظَلِ is said to be the correct explanation: but from what will be seen voce هَبِيدٌ, I think it most probable that the right meaning is <i>The seeds of the colocynth.</i>]) ―         -b3-  IF also says that it signifies The فَسِيل [i. e. <i>shoot,</i> or <i>shoots, of the palm-tree,</i>] <i>which is,</i> or <i>are, plucked forth</i> [<i>entire,</i>] <i>from the base thereof.</i> (O.)       -A2-  تَمْرٌ فَثٌّ <br>\
                  <i>Dates that are scattered;</i> (Lth, Kr, M, K;) <i>not in a provision-bag</i> or <i>other receptacle;</i> like بَثٌّ: (Kr, M:) or <i>dates that are separate, each one from others; not sticking together;</i> (T, O;) and so فَذٌّ and بَذٌّ and فَضٌّ. (T.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>مَفَثَّةٌ</b>               1     <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>Multitude:</i> (T, O, K:) so in the saying, وُجِدَ لِبَنِى فُلَانٍ مَفَثَّةٌ [<i>Multitude was found to be attributable to the sons of such a one</i>] when they were numbered: (T, O:) and مَقَثَّةٌ signifies the same. (K and TA in art. قث.) ―         -b2-  And [<i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  نُزُلٌ:] one says, مَا رَاَيْنَا جُلَّةً اَكْثَرَ مَفَثَّةً مِنْهَا, meaning نُزُلًا [i. e. <i>We have not seen a receptacle made of palm-leaves, for dates, having more food prepared for the guest than it</i>]: (T, O:) and كَثِيرُ <br>\
                  مَفَثَّةٍ means كَثِيرُ نُزُلٍ [i. e. <i>Abundant in respect of food prepared for the guest</i>]. (So in some copies of the K: in other copies نَزَلٍ. [The TA gives the latter reading; and so, therefore, does the TK, which explains it as meaning “ increase, ” and adds that one says طعام كثير مفثة, an ex. app. without any authority; for what I have cited from the T and O shows, I think, that the former reading, and not the latter, is unquestionably right.])   </entryFree> <br>\
