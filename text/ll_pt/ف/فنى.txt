                  عُدِمَ: (K, TA:) it is said of every created thing that it is subject to الفَنَا=ء. (Msb.) [Hence] دَارُ الفَنَا=ءِ [<i>The abode of transitoriness, evanescence,</i> or <i>perishableness,</i>] means <i>the present world.</i> (T in art. دور.) ―         -b2-  And, said of a man, (T, M, K,) i. e. فَنِىَ, aor. and inf. n. as above, (M,) (tropical:)  <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, extremely aged;</i> or <i>old and infirm;</i> syn. هَرِمَ: (M, K:) or <i>he became on the verge of death by reason of extreme age</i> or <i>of age and infirmity.</i> (T.)

(S, M: in the T, accord. to the TT, the verse ends with رَايِدُهَا [her pastor], instead of قَايِدُهَا.) Accord. to IAar, فاناهُ signifies واِجاهُ [app. a mistranscription for وَاخَاهُ, originally ا=خَاهُ, <i>He fraternized with him;</i> or <i>acted with him in a brotherly manner</i>]. (TA.) [Hence the phrase] اُفَانِى الاَيَّامَ i. e. اُزَجِّى الزَّمَانَ [meaning <i>I make the time to pass away easily;</i> as though beguiling it]. (Har p. 607.) ―         -b2-  And one says, بَنُو فُلَانٍ مَا <br>\
