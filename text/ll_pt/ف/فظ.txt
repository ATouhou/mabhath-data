      فِظَاظٌ is syn. with these, (M, K,) and so is ↓ <br>\
      فَظَاظٌ, but these two are simple substs., (M,) <i>He</i> (a man) <i>was,</i> or <i>became, such as is termed</i> <br>\

      افتظّ signifies <i>he gave his camel to drink, then bound his mouth in order that he might not ruminate, and, when attacked by thirst, cut open his belly, and pressed out,</i> or <i>squeezed out, the fluid of the feces of his stomach, and drank it:</i> (S:) and الكَرِشَ ↓ <br>\

(M.) You say, اـِنَّهُ لَفَظٌّ بَظٌّ [<i>Verily he is rough, coarse,</i> or <i>the like</i>]; the latter word being an imitative sequent; (M, K;) as such we regard it because Th, who mentions it, does not explan it; (M;) and ↓ <br>\
      فَظِيظٌ <br>\
                  بَظِيظٌ [app. signifies the same]. (TA in art. بظ.)       -A2-  Also The <i>water of the stomach</i> [<i>of a camel</i>], (T, S, K,) <i>which is pressed,</i> or <i>squeezed, out, and drunk,</i> (T, K,) <i>on an occasion of want of water,</i> (T,) <i>in the waterless deserts;</i> (T, K;) the <i>water that comes forth from the stomach</i> [<i>of a camel</i>]; because it is a coarse, or bitter, beverage: (M:) it may not be used for the purpose of religious purification: (Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, T:) also, the <i>urine of horses which is drunk on an occasion of thirst:</i> pl. فُظُوظٌ: thus used by Mutemmem Ibn-Nuweyreh.

                   The <i>seminal fluid of a woman:</i> or <i>of a stallion:</i> (M, K:) so they assert: but it is not of established authority: (M:) and so say IDrd and Fr: (TA:) accord. to Kr, the <i>seminal fluid of a stallion, in a she-camel&#39;s womb:</i> (M, * TA:) or this is the explanation given by Fr: (T:) and ↓ <br>\
      فُظَاظَةٌ is of the measure فُعَالَةٌ from this word; (K;) as signifying the <i>seminal fluid of a stallion,</i> or the <i>water of the stomach;</i> but El-Khattábee disallows the latter meaning; or from فَظٌّ: (TA:) and hence the saying of &#39;Áïsheh to Marwán, وَلٰكِنَّ <br>\
