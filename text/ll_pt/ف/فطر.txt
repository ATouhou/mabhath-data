                  خِلْقَةٌ. (S, Mgh.) It is said to have this signification in the Kur xxx. 29. (TA.) And so in the saying of Mohammad, كُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلَى <br>\
                  الفِطْرَةِ <br>\
                  <i>Every infant is born in a state of conformity to the natural constitution with which he is created in his mother&#39;s womb,</i> either <i>prosperous</i> or <i>unprosperous</i> [<i>in relation to the soul</i>]; and if his parents are Jews, they make him a Jew, with respect to his worldly predicament; [i. e., with respect to inheritances &amp;amp;c.;] and if Christians, they make him a Christian, with respect to that predicament; and if Magians, they make him a Magian, with respect to that predicament; his predicament is the same as that of his parents until his tongue speaks for him: but if he die before his attaining to the age when virility begins to show itself, he dies in a state of conformity to his preceding natural constitution, with which he was created in his mother&#39;s womb. (AHeyth, TA.) [See another explanation of the word, as occurring in this trad., below.] ―         -b3-  <i>Nature; constitution;</i> or <i>natural, native, innate,</i> or <i>original, disposition,</i> or <i>temper</i> or other <i>quality</i> or <i>property; idiosyncrasy.</i> (Th, TA.) ―         -b4-  The <i>faculty of knowing God, with which He has created mankind:</i> (TA:) the <i>natural constitution with which a child is created in his mother&#39;s womb, whereby he is capable of accepting the religion of truth:</i> this is a secondary application: and this is [said to be] the signification meant in the trad. mentioned above. (Mgh.) ―         -b5-  Hence, The <i>religion of el-Islám:</i> (Mgh:) the <i>profession whereby a man becomes a Muslim, which is the declaration that there is no deity but God, and that Mohammad is his servant and his apostle, who brought the truth from Him,</i> and this is (AHeyth, TA) <i>religion.</i> (AHeyth, K, TA.) This is shown by a trad., in which it is related that Mohammad taught a man to repeat certain words when lying down to sleep, and said فَاـِنَّكَ اـِنْ مُتَّ مِنْ لَيْلَتِكَ <br>\
                  مُتَّ عَلَى الفِطْرَةِ [<i>And then, if thou die that same night, thou diest in the profession of the true religion</i>]. (AHeyth, TA.) Also by the saying, قَصُّ <br>\
