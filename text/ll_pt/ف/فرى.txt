                  , (M, K,) aor. يَفْرِيهِ, (K,) inf. n. فَرْىٌ, (K,) <i>He slit it,</i> or <i>cut it lengthwise, ill,</i> or <i>improperly;</i> or <i>well,</i> or <i>properly;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      فرّاهُ and ↓ <br>\
      افراهُ [both relating to both of the foregoing explanations]: (K:) or <i>he slit it,</i> or <i>cut it lengthwise, and made it bad,</i> or <i>improper;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      فرّاهُ: or, accord. to the sound lexicologists, the former has this meaning: but ↓ <br>\
      افرى signifies <i>he slit,</i> or <i>cut lengthwise, and made good,</i> or <i>proper:</i> (M:) or ↓ <br>\
      افراهُ (M, K) signifies, (M,) or signifies also, (K,) <i>he made it good,</i> or <i>proper:</i> or <i>he ordered</i> [another] <i>to make it so:</i> (M, K:) as though he removed from it unsoundness, or imperfection: but some say that this signifies <i>he slit it,</i> or <i>cut it lengthwise, and made it bad,</i> or <i>improper:</i> and when you mean <i>he measured it, and cut it, to make it good,</i> or <i>proper,</i> you say فَرَاهُ, inf. n. فَرْىٌ: (M:) [thus, accord. to J,] فَرَى, aor. and inf. n. as above, signifies <i>he cut</i> a thing <i>in order to make it good,</i> or <i>proper:</i> (S:) or <i>he cut</i> a skin, or hide, <i>in a good,</i> or <i>proper, manner:</i> (Ks, S, Msb:) and ↓ <br>\
      افرى <br>\
                  <i>he cut</i> it <i>in a bad,</i> or <i>an improper, manner:</i> (Ks, S:) or this signifies <i>he slit much, in a bad,</i> or <i>an improper, manner:</i> and افرى <br>\
                  الجِلْدَ, accord. to As, <i>he rent, tore,</i> or <i>slit, the skin, and made holes in it, and spoiled it:</i> and افرى signifies also <i>he slit</i> a thing (S, M, Msb) of any kind; (as also ↓ <br>\
      فرّاهُ:]) thus you say, افرى الاَودَاجَ <br>\
                  <i>he slit the</i> <br>\
                  اوداج [or <i>external jugular veins</i>], (T, M, Mgh, Msb,) <i>and made what was in them, of the blood, to come forth;</i> (T, Mgh, Msb;) and in like manner one says of a garment, or piece of cloth, and of a جُلَّة [or receptacle for dates, made of palm-leaves woven together]; (T;) or <i>he cut the</i> <br>\
                  اوداج: (S:) IAar alone mentions فَرَى اَوْدَاجَهُ and ↓ <br>\
      افراها: (M:) [but it is also said that فَرَى signifies <i>he cut</i> a نِطَع [or the like]: (K in art. خلق: [see an ex. in a verse cited in the first paragraph of that art.; also cited in the T after the first of the explanations here following, and in the M after the second thereof:]) or فَرَى, aor. and inf. n. as above, signifies <i>he measured, and worked,</i> or <i>manufactured,</i> and <i>made good,</i> or <i>proper,</i> a thing, such as a sandal, or a نِطَع [q. v.], or a water-skin, and the like: (T:) or <i>he measured</i> it, <i>and cut</i> it, <i>to make it good,</i> or <i>proper:</i> (M:) and <i>he measured and manufactured</i> a مَزَادَة [or leathern water-bag]: (S, K:) or <i>he sewed, and made well,</i> or <i>properly,</i> a مزادة: (T:) [it is said that] the difference between ↓ <br>\
      الاـِفْرَاْءُ an الفَرْىُ is this, that the former signifies <i>the cutting so as to render bad,</i> or <i>improper,</i> and <i>the slitting like as the slaughterer and the wild beast slit</i> [<i>their victims</i>]; and the latter, <i>the cutting so as to make good,</i> or <i>proper,</i> like the act of cutting of the sewer of the hide, or of leather: but فَرَى sometimes occurs in the sense of افرى: (Mgh:) one says, رَاْسَهُ ↓ <br>\
      اَفْرَيْتُ, meaning <i>I split,</i> or <i>clave, his head</i> with a sword; like اَفْرَرْتُهُ: (Yz, T &amp;amp;c. in art. فر:) and افرى الجُرْحَ <br>\
                  <i>he slit the wound:</i> (T:) and افرى الذِّيْبُ بَطْنَ الشَّاةِ [<i>the wolf slit,</i> or <i>rent, the belly of the sheep,</i> or <i>goat</i>]: (S:) and one says, قَدْ اَفْرَيْتَ وَمَا فَرَيْتَ i. e. <i>thou hast done ill,</i> or <i>improperly, and hast not done well,</i> or <i>properly.</i> (A, TA.) ―         -b2-  فَرَاهُ, aor. as above, [and so the inf. n.,] is sometimes metonymically used [as meaning (tropical:)  <i>He slaughtered him,</i> or <i>butchered him;</i> i. e.] as denoting vehemence, or excess, in slaying. (TA.) ―         -b3-  And it means also (assumed tropical:)  <i>He cut him with censure,</i> or <i>satire:</i> (TA:) and ↓ <br>\
      افرى means <i>he blamed,</i> or <i>censured,</i> a man. (M, K.) ―         -b4-  And you say, فَرَيْتُ الاَرْضَ (tropical:)  <i>I traversed,</i> or <i>crossed,</i> (lit. <i>travelled and cut,</i>) <i>the land,</i> or <i>country;</i> (T, S, K, TA;) inf. n. as above. (TA.) ―         -b5-  هُوَ يَفْرِى ↓ <br>\
      الفَرِىَّ means (assumed tropical:)  <i>He effects what is wonderful in his deed.</i> (S, K.) اَحَدٌ ↓ <br>\
      مَا يَفْرِى فَرِيَّهُ, thus, with teshdeed [to the ى in فريه] as related by A&#39;Obeyd, is said of a courageous man [as meaning <i>No one does his deed,</i> or the like]: but it is said [by Kh] to be correctly فَرْيَهُ, [as an inf. n.,] without tesh-deed. (M. [See, however, what follows.]) They say, ↓ <br>\
      تَرَكْتُهُ يَفْرِى الفَرِىَّ, meaning [<i>I left him</i>] <i>doing well,</i> or <i>excellently, in a deed,</i> or <i>in watering:</i> [an explanation relating to what here follows:] the Prophet said, respecting &#39;Omar, whom he saw in a dream drawing water at a well with a great bucket, ↓ <br>\
      فَلَمْ اَرَ عَبْقَرِيًّا يَفْرِى فَرِيَّهُ [<i>And I have not seen a chief of a people do his deed,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (T:) or, as some relate it, he said فَرْيَهُ: (TA:) [but] A&#39;Obeyd says, this is like thy saying يَعْمَلُ <br>\
                  عَمَلَهُ and يَقُولُ قَوْلَهُ; and Fr cited to us [as an ex.] <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

      قَدْ كُنْتِ تَفْرِينَ بِهِ الفَرِيَّا<br>\
                  </quote> meaning [<i>Verily</i>] <i>thou didst multiply and magnify thy words respecting it:</i> (T: and in like manner this hemistich [which shows, by the measure, that الفَرِيَّا cannot be here a mistake for الفَرْيَا,] is expl. in the S:) it is said that ↓ <br>\
      فَرِىّ thus used is of the measure فَعيلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, from فَرَى signifying “ he cut ” [or “ cut lengthwise ” or “ slit ”] a hide, or leather; (Har p. 257; [where see more;]) [and this assertion is corroborated by the fact that] one says of a man strenuous, or vigorous, in an affair, and strong, وَيَقُدُّ ↓ <br>\
      تَرَكْتُهُ يَفْرِى الفَرِىَّ [lit. <i>I left him slitting,</i> or <i>cutting, the slit,</i> or <i>cut, thing, and shaping</i>]. (T.) ―         -b6-  فَرَى is also synonymous with افترى: see the latter, in two places. ―         -b7-  فَرَى البَرْقُ, aor. and inf. n. as above, signifies <i>The lightning shone,</i> or <i>glistened,</i> or <i>shone with flickering light, and continued, in the sky.</i> (T, TA.)       -A2-  فَرِىَ, (T, S, M, K,) aor. يَفْرَى, (T, S,) inf. n. فَرًى, (T, S, K, but omitted in the CK,) <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, confounded,</i> or <i>perplexed, and unable to see his right course;</i> syn. بَهِتَ, (T,) and دَهِشَ, (T, S, M, K,) and تَحَيَّرَ, (S, K,) and بَطِرَ: (Skr, on the verse here following:) El-Aalam El-Hudhalee says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>And I became confounded,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>by reason of fright, so that I did not shoot</i> an arrow, <i>nor bade I farewell to a friend</i>]: (T, M:) or, accord. to As, فَرِىَ, aor. يَفْرَى, signifies <i>he looked, and knew not what he should do:</i> (T:) and فَرِيتُ signifies also <i>I wondered;</i> from ↓ <br>\
