                  , aor. يَفُوتُ, inf. n. فَوْتٌ and فَوَاتٌ, originally signifies فَاتَ وَقْتُ فِعْلِهِ [i. e. <i>The time,</i> or <i>opportunity, of the doing,</i> or <i>performing, of the affair passed, passed away, elapsed,</i> or <i>escaped, neglected by him, without his doing it</i> or <i>performing it</i>]; and hence the phrase فَاتَتِ الصَّلَاةُ, meaning <i>The time of prayer passed, passed away, elapsed,</i> or <i>escaped, without his performing it therein</i> (Msb:) and ↓ <br>\
      افتات is syn. with فَاتَ. (M, O.) [And both of these verbs are trans.:] one says فَاتَهُ الشَّىْءُ, (S, O, Msb,) or الاَمْرُ, (M, K,) aor. as above, (O,) and so the inf. ns.; (S, * M, O, * Msb, K;) and ↓ <br>\
      افتاتهُ: (K;) <i>The thing, (??) affair, passed,</i> or <i>passed away, from him</i> [<i>neglected by him</i>]; (M, K;) [or <i>the time,</i> or <i>opportunity, of the doing,</i> or <i>performing, thereof passed,</i> or <i>passed away from him neglected by him;</i>] or <i>the thing escaped him,</i> [or <i>became beyond his reach,</i>] <i>so that he was unable to attain it,</i> or <i>to do it,</i> or <i>to accomplish it.</i> (Msb.) But this explanation is not applicable except in the case of prayer, and the like: in other cases, فَاتَهُ signifies <i>He,</i> or <i>it, preceded him; was,</i> or <i>became,</i> or <i>got, before him; outwent him; passed beyond him;</i> or <i>had, got,</i> or <i>look, precedence of him:</i> and <i>went,</i> or <i>passed, away from him:</i> and <i>the like.</i> (MF, TA.) One says, فَاتَنِى كَذَا, meaning سَبَقَنِى [i. e. <i>Such a thing preceded me,</i> &amp;amp;c., app. <i>so as to become beyond my reach</i>]: and فُتُّهُ <br>\
                  اَنَا [<i>I preceded it,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (T:) and جَارَيْتُهُ حَتَّى <br>\

                  <i>I ran with him until I passed beyond him,</i> or <i>outwent him:</i> (A, TA:) and فَاتَهُ فُلَانٌ بِذِرَاعٍ <br>\
                  <i>Such a one preceded him,</i> or <i>outwent him, by a cubit.</i> (Msb.) فَلَا فَوْتَ, in the Kur xxxiv. 50, means فَلَا فَوْتَ لَهُمْ مِنًّا [<i>And there shall be for them no escaping from us</i>], i. e. لَا يَفُوتُونَنَا [<i>they shall not escape us</i>]. (Jel. [And Bd says the like; adding, “ by flight, or fortifying themselves. ”]) An Arab of the desert is related to have said, الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِى لا يُفَاتُ وَلَا [expl. in art. ليت) (T. And they assert that a man went forth from his family, and when he returned, his wife said to him, “ If thou hadst been present with us, we would have related to thee what hath happened; ” whereupon he said to her, لَمْ تُفَاتِى <br>\
                  فَهَاتِى (M, Meyd) i. e. <i>It has not escaped thee</i> [lit. <i>thou hast not been escaped</i>], <i>so adduce</i> what thou hast [to tell]: the saying is a proverb. (Meyd.) ―         -b2-  See also 5: and see 8, in three places. ―         -b3-  فَاتَ is also <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
