                  , a word occurring in the Kur ii. 58, (T, S, M, &amp;amp;c.,) is expl. as signifying the same as ثُومٌ [which generally means <i>Garlic;</i> but is said to have also the meaning here next following]; (T, S, M, Msb, K;) said to be a dial. var. of the latter word, but app. [if meaning “ garlic ”] formed, as IJ says, by the substitution of ف for ث; (M;) and &#39;Abd-Allah [Ibn-Mes&#39;ood] read [in the Kur ubi suprà] وَثُومِهَا [instead of وَفُومِهَا]: (Fr, T, S:) it is also expl. as signifying <i>wheat;</i> (T, S, M, Msb, K;) which is said by Lh to be a meaning of ثُوم and فُوم; and if Ibn-Mes&#39;ood read the word as ثوم, the meaning is فوم, i. e. “ wheat; ” (T;) accord. to Fr, it is an old word, signifying thus, (T, S, *) and also <i>bread;</i> (T, S, K;) Zj says that there is no difference of state-  ment among the lexicologists as to its having the former of these two meanings, that it is said to have the latter also, and that it also signifies the <i>other grains, beside wheat, whereof bread is made</i> [which last meaning is also mentioned in the K]; (T;) and IJ holds that it is rightly expl. as having the first of these three meanings (i. e. “ wheat ”) and the last of them: (M:) another meaning assigned to it is حِمَّصٌ [i. e. <i>cicer arietinum;</i> or <i>chick-peas</i>]; (S, K;) which is of the dial. of Syria: (S:) and it signifies also <i>any</i> <br>\

      فُومَةٌ is its n. un.; (M;) this latter signifying <i>an ear of corn,</i> (S, K, TA,) as expl. by IDrd: (TA:) فُومٌ has فُومَانٌ [of the measure فُعْلَنَانٌ] for a pl., this being [virtually] a pl. pl.; mentioned by IJ, who says that the dammeh in فُومٌ is different from the dammeh in فُومَانٌ.
