Asd or Asad] say يا فل [app. يَافُلُ, without any variation,] in calling to a man and to two men and to a pl. number of men and to a female: (TA in art. فلن:) accord. to As, one says يَا فُلُ and يَا فُلَاهْ; he who says يَا فُلُ saying thus [when he pauses after it and] when he goes on, making the noun marfooa without tenween; whereas he who says يَافُلَاهْ says thus when he is silent after it, retaining the ه [which is termed the ه of pausation]. but when he goes on he rejects the ه and makes the noun to be mansoob, saying [for ex.] يَا فُلَا قُلْ [<i>O such a one, say</i>].
