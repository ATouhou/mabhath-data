In the case of a man who has sworn that he will abstain from conjugal intercourse with his wife, a period of four months is appointed to him in the Kur-án; and if he have such intercourse with her in the four months, it is said of him, قَدْ فَا=ءَ, meaning <i>He has returned</i> [or <i>reverted</i>] from his oath, to the doing that which he swore that he would not do, and is bound to expiate his oath: if he have not had such intercourse with her until the end of the four months from the day of his swearing, then, Ibn-&#39;Abbás and a number of the Companions pass upon her a single sentence of divorce, making the [said sentence of] divorce to have effect at the end of the months; but many of the Companions and others say that in this case he must return, and expiate his oath, or he must divorce.
