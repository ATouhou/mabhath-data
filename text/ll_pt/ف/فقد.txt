[فُقِدَ signifies <i>It was not found, was lost, was not seen,</i> &amp;amp;c.] It is related of Abu-dDardà that he said, يَفْقِدْ ↓ <br>\
      مَنْ يَتَفَقَّدْ, [lit. <i>He who seeks will not find,</i>] meaning <i>he who seeks after good in mankind will not find it;</i> for he saw good to be rare in mankind: or <i>he who seeks to acquaint himself with the circumstances of men will not find what will please him.</i> (L.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>God caused him to lose,</i> or <i>fail of finding, him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (L, K.) One says, اَفْقَدَكَ <br>\

[Or] الاـِفْقَادُ is not of established authority: as to the saying الجُنُونُ يُفْقِدُ شَهْوَةَ الجِمَاعِ [meaning <i>Insanity causes to lose,</i> or <i>annuls, the desire of coïtus</i>], the correct word is يُعْدِمُ or يُزِيلُ.
