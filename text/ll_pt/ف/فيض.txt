                  الرَّجُلُ, nor فاضت نفسه, for فاض is only said of tears and of water: (S, O:) to which is added in the O, but one says, فَاظَ, with ظ, [as is also said in the Mgh,] as meaning “ he died, ” and not فاض, with ض, decidedly: (TA:) [see, however, the remarks of IB below:] or the more chaste expression is فاظ, with ظ, without the mention of the نفس; and some do not allow any other: (Msb:) but in the L we find as follows: IAar says. فاض الرجل and فاظ, meaning “ the man died: ” and Abu-l-Hasan says, فاظت نفسه, the verb relating to the نفس; and فاض الرجل and فاظ: but As says, I heard AA say that one should not say, فاظت نفسه, but فاظ, meaning “ he died; ” and not فاض, with ض, decidedly: IB, however, says that what IDrd has cited from As is different from that which J has ascribed to him; for IDrd cites the words of As thus: the Arabs says, فاظ الرجل, meaning “ the man died; ” but when they speak of the نفس, they say فاضت نفسه, with ض; and he quotes the ex. <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>And an eye was put out, and a soul departed</i>]: and he [IB] adds that this is what is commonly known to be the opinion of As: but J has committed and error; for As quotes from AA that one should not say, فاظت نفسه, but فاظ, meaning “ he died; ” not فاض, decidedly and he also says, nor does it necessarily follow from what he relates that he firmly believed it: AO says that فاظت نفسه is of the dial. of Keys; and فاضت, of the dial of Temeem and AHát says, I heard AZ say that Benoo-Dabbeh alone say, فاضت نفسه: in like manner also El-Mázinee says. on the authority of AZ. that all the Arabs say, فاظت <br>\
                  نفسه. except Benoo-Dabbeh, who say, فاضت نفسه with ض. (TA.) [See also art. فيظ. It is further said, that] الفَيْضُ signifies <i>Death:</i> (A, K;) as occurring in a trad respecting Ed-Dejjál, where it is said, ثُمَّ يَكُونُ عَلَى اَثَرِ ذٰلِكَ الفَيْضُ [<i>Then shall be, after that, death</i>] (A, TA:) Sh says, I asked El-Bekráwee respecting this, and he asserted الفيض, in this case, to signify “ death; ” but I have not heard it from any other; unless it be from فَاضَتْ نَفْسَهُ signifying <i>His slaver collecting upon his lips at the departure of his soul</i> [<i>flowed</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b6-  You say also فَاضَ <br>\
                  صدْرُهُ مِنَ الغَيْظِ (tropical:)  [<i>His bosom overflowed with wrath,</i> or <i>rage</i>], (A, TA.) And فَاضَ صَدْرُهُ <br>\

[says ISd,] in my opinion, is the correct signification. (M.) ―         -b2-  <i>He made</i> water, and tears, and the like, <i>to run,</i> or <i>flow;</i> or <i>to pour out,</i> or <i>forth;</i> or <i>to pour out,</i> or <i>forth, vehemently; to gush out,</i> or <i>forth:</i> (M:) <i>he poured</i> [water &amp;amp;c.] <i>out,</i> or <i>forth:</i> (A, TA:) or <i>he poured</i> water <i>out,</i> or <i>forth, copiously.</i> (Mgh.) You say, افاض المَا=ءَ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ, (S, O, K,) or على جَسَدِهِ, (Msb,) <i>He poured the water</i> (S, O, Msb, K) <i>upon himself,</i> (S, O, K,) or <i>upon his body.</i> (Msb.)

                  مَكِّةَ (tropical:)  <i>They returned from Mine to Mekkeh;</i> on the day of the sacrifice: (Msb:) اـِفَاضَةٌ signifies (tropical:)  the <i>advancing, and pushing on,</i> or <i>pressing on,</i> in journeying, or pace, (A, * TA,) and the like, (A,) <i>with multitude,</i> and is only after a state of separation and congregation: (TA:) it is from the same word as signifying the “ pouring out, or forth; ” (A, O, TA,) or from افاض المَا=ءَ signifying “ he poured the water out, or forth, copiously ” (Mgh:) and the original expression is افاض نَفْسَهُ. or رَاحِلَتَهُ; but they omit the objective complement, and hence the verb resembles one that is intrans.: (O, TA:) or افاضة signifies the <i>quickly impelling</i> or <i>urging</i> [a beast] <i>to run, with one&#39;s foot</i> or <i>leg,</i> or <i>feet or legs:</i> and افاض, <i>he</i> (a (??)) <i>made his camel to exert himself beyond measure, (??) quick run, between the utmost (??) and what is (??) than that;</i> <br>\
                  افاضة denoting <i>the half</i> [<i>of the fall (??) of the run of camels having riders upon these;</i> and being only applied when they have riders upon them: (Khálid Ibn-Jembeh:) and every دَفْعَة [or <i>act of pushing on,</i> or <i>pressing (??),</i>] is termed اـِفَاضَةٌ. (S, Msb, K.) Hence, طَوَافُ الاـِفَاضَةِ, signifying <i>The (??)</i> [around the K(??) <i>the return from Mine to Mekkeh;</i> (Msb, TA) on the day of the sacrifice: (TA:) or <i>the circuiting of visitation.</i> (Mgh.) ―         -b6-  افاضوا فِى الحَدِيثِ (tropical:)  <i>They pushed on,</i> or <i>pressed on, in discourse;</i> syn. اِنْدَفَعُوا: (Lh, S, M, A, O,) <i>they entered thereinto; launched forth,</i> or <i>cut, thereinto:</i> (Lh, M, O;) <i>they were large,</i> or <i>copious,</i> or <i>profuse, therein;</i> (O, TA:) or <i>they dilated therein</i> (M:) or <i>they began, commenced,</i> or <i>entered upon, discourse:</i> (Msb;) as also ↓ <br>\

[And ما افاض بكلمة signifies the same.] ―         -b10-  افاض بِالقِدَاحِ, (S, M, A, O, K,) and عَلَى القِدَاحِ, meaning بِالقِدَاحِ, for prepositions stand in the places of other prepositions, (S, O,) and افاض القِدَاحَ, (O, K,) (tropical:)  <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
