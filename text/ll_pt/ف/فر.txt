                  <i>He showed his teeth laughing;</i> (S;) as also افتر عَنْ ثَغْرِهِ. (T.) It is said of the Prophet, الغَمَامِ وَ يَفْتَرُّ عَنْ مِثْلِ حَبِّ meaning <i>And he used to smile so as to show</i> teeth <i>the like of hail-stones, without a reiterated,</i> or <i>a loud, laughing.</i> (T.) ―         -b2-  Hence, (TA,) افترّ البَرْقُ <br>\
