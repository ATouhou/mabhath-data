                   [<i>A kind of animal,</i>] <i>well known,</i> (M, K,) [the <i>genus mus;</i> the <i>rat;</i> the <i>mouse;</i> and <i>the like</i>]; with ء, (Lth, S, Msb,) and without ء; (Msb;) [a coll. gen. n.:] n. un. with ة: (Lth, T:) [in the S and O and Msb, فَاْرٌ is said to be pl. of فَاْرَةٌ, but in the last is added, like تَمْرَةٌ and تَمْرٌ, showing that by pl. is meant coll. gen. n.:] the pl. of فار, (Lth, T, M, K,) or of فارة, (O, Msb,) is فِيْرَانٌ (Lth, T, M, O, K, Msb) and فِيِرَةٌ: (M, K:) accord. to IAar, (T, TA,) ↓ <br>\
      فُوَرٌ, like صُرَدٌ, (O, K, TA,) is applied to the male: (T, O, K, TA:) but this last word occurs in the phrase الفَاْر الفُوَر, [in which الفار is evidently used in a sense mentioned below, namely, “ the muscles, ” as is indicated in the T and O,] and, accord. to some, [الفُوَر is a corroborative epithet, for they say that] this phrase is like لَيْلٌ لَايِلٌ and يَوْمٌ اَيْوَمُ: (O:) فَاْرَةٌ is applied [accord. to some] to the female; (M;) or [more correctly] to the male and the female, (M, K,) like as حَمَامَةٌ is applied to the male and the female of the [genus] حَمَام. (M, TA.) ―         -b2-  Also <i>Musk:</i> (M, K:) this is sometimes called فَاْرٌ because it is from the [animal, or from a kind of animal, called] فَاْر, as some say. (M.) ―         -b3-  And فَاْرَةُ المِسْكِ signifies <i>The bag, follicle,</i> or <i>vesicle,</i> (نَافِجَة, S, M, O, K, or نَافِقَة, T,) <i>of musk:</i> (T, S, M, O, K:) and is also without ء; (M, Msb;) or it should correctly be mentioned in art. فور, [as being called فَارَةٌ] because of the spreading (فَوَرَان) of its odour: or it may be with ء because it has the appearance, or form, of the [animal called] فَاْرَة. (O, K.) It was said to an Arab of the desert اَتَهْمِزُ الفَاْرَةَ, (K, TA, in the CK اَتُهْمَزُ الفَاْرُ,) [meaning <i>Dost thou pronounce</i> <br>\
                  فارة <br>\
                  <i>with hemz?</i>], and he replied, [understanding the animal so called to be meant,] الهِرَّةُ تَهْمِزُهَا, (K,) meaning, [<i>The cat</i>] <i>bites it.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  [Hence, app., by a synecdoche, فَاْرَةُ المِسْكِ is applied to <i>The mush-animal,</i> or <i>Tibet-musk; moschus moschiferus:</i>] El-Jáhidh says, I asked a perfumer, of [the sect of] the Moatezileh, respecting [the animal called] فارة المسك, and he said, <i>it is not a mouse,</i> or <i>rat,</i> (فارة,) <i>but is more like a young gazelle: it is found in the region of Tubbat</i> [or <i>Tibet</i>]; <i>and is hunted; and the man who catches it binds tightly its navel,</i> [or rather <i>its umbilical follicle,</i>] <i>which being pendent, the blood collects in it; then it is slaughtered; and when it is quiet, he cuts out the bound navel, and buries it in barley</i> (شعير) <i>until the congealed blood becomes converted into strong-scented musk.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  And فَاْرَةُ الاـِبِلِ signifies <i>The sweet odour of the camels,</i> [<i>likened to that of the vesicle of musk,</i>] <i>which diffuses itself from them when they have pastured upon the herbs and their blossoms,</i> (S, O,) or, as some say, <i>upon the</i> [<i>plant called</i>] خُزَامَى [q. v.], (O,) <i>and then drunk, and returned from the water, with their skins moist:</i> (S, O:) so says Yaakoob. (S.) Thus in a verse cited voce ذَفِرٌ. (S, O. [Therefore فَاْرَةٌ ذَفْرَا=ءُ should there be rendered <i>A pungent sweet odour like that of a vesicle of musk.</i> But see فَارَة, in art. فور.])       -A2-  الفَاْرُ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  <i>The muscles:</i> (T, O:) and فَاْرُ المَتْنِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>the flesh on either side of the back-bone;</i> as also يَرَابِيعُ المَتْنِ. (T. [See also الفَارُ, in art. فور.])       -A3-  And <i>A species of trees;</i> with and without ء: (M:) and فَاْرَةٌ [as its n. un.] <i>a tree</i> [<i>of that species</i>]. (K.)       -A4-  Also <i>A certain well-known measure,</i> or <i>quantity, of wheat:</i> in this sense an adventitious word. (O.)    </entryFree> <br>\
