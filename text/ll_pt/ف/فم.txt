                   The <i>mouth:</i> (MA, KL, &amp;amp;c.:) it is originally فَوَهٌ, (S, K, and Msb in art. فوه,) with two fet-hahs, (Msb in that art.,) or فَوْهٌ; (so in some copies of the S;) the ه being cut off from it, the و is not susceptible of declension, because it is quiescent, therefore م is substituted for it; but when you form the dim. or the pl., you restore it to its original state, saying [in the former case] فُوَيْهٌ and [in the latter case] اَفْوَاهٌ, and not اَفْمَا=ءٌ [in some of the copies of the S not اَفْمَامٌ]: but when you form the rel. n., you say ↓ <br>\
      فَمِىٌّ; and, if you will, ↓ <br>\
      فَمَوِىٌّ, combining the substitute and the letter for which it is substituted, like as they say in the dual فَمَوَانِ; this being held to be allowable because of there being therein another letter rejected, i. e. the ه, as though they made the م in this case to be a substitute for the ه, not for the و: (S, TA:) and one says also فَمَيَانِ, which, like فَمَوَانِ, is anomalous; (IAar, K in art. فوه;) but one says فَمَانِ also, as well as فَمَوَانِ: (Msb in art. فوه:) it has three forms, فَمٌ and فُمٌ and فِمٌ: (S, K, TA:) and some decline it doubly; saying in the nom. case فُمٌ, accus. فَمًا, and gen. فِمٍ; (S, TA;) like اِمْرُوٌ and اِبْنُمٌ, which have been said to be the only other instances of the kind: (TA:) when it is prefixed to the [pronominal] ى, one says فِىَّ and فَمِى: but when to [a pronoun] other than the ى, it is declined with the letters و and ا and ى, so that one says فُوُهُ and فَاهُ and فِيهِ; but one also says فَمُهُ: (Msb. in art. فوه:) and sometimes the م is musheddedeh, (S, K,) in poetry, as in the saying, (S, TA,) of Mohammad Ibn-Dhu-eyb El-&#39;Ománee El-Fukeymee, the rájiz, (TA in this art. and in art. طسم,) addressing Er-Rasheed, or, accord. to IKh, said in relation to Suleymán Ibn-&#39;Abd-El-Melik and &#39;Abd-El- &#39;Azeez.

[<i>O, would that it had gone forth from his mouth, so that the dominion might return</i>] <i>to its rightful owner;</i> (S in art. سطم, and TA in art. طسم;) and it would have been allowable, (S, TA,) accord. to ISk, (S,) or accord. to Fr, (TA,) if he had said ↓ <br>\
      من فَمِّهِ, with fet-h to the ف: (S, TA:) the pl. of فم, with teshdeed, is اَفْمَامٌ; and its dim. is ↓ <br>\
      فُمَيْمٌ, mentioned by Lh. (TA.) MF says that many of the expositors of the Tes-heel have collected the dial. vars. of this word, compounded and uncompounded, and they have exceeded twenty; that with fet-h, they say, being the most common and the most chaste. (TA.) [See more in art. فوه.] ―         -b2-  [Hence,] الفم is metonymically applied to (tropical:)  <i>The teeth.</i> (Ham p. 242.) ―         -b3-  [Hence also,] فَمُ الحُوتِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The star</i> [a] <i>in the mouth of Piscis Australis.</i> (Kzw &amp;amp;c.: see art. حوت.) And فَمُ الفَرَسِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The star</i> [e] <i>upon the lip of Pegasus.</i> (Kzw.) ―         -b4-  [And فَمُالرَّحِمِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The mouth of the womb.</i>] ―         -b5-  And فَمُ النَّهْرِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The mouth of the river.</i> (MA.) ―         -b6-  And [hence likewise,] فَمٌ is also used as meaning (assumed tropical:) <i>Branch;</i> opposed to اِسْتٌ meaning “ root. ” (TA in art. سته; in which see اِسْتٌ, last quarter.)       -A2-  فَمٌ مِنَ <br>\
                  الدِّبَاغِ means The <i>quantity that is used at one time, of tan;</i> (Fr, K, * TA;) like نَفْسٌ مِنْهُ. (Fr, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   a dial. var. of the conjunction تُمَّ [q. v.]: (K:) or the ف in the former is a substitute for the ث in the latter: one says, رَاَيْتُ عَمْرًا فُمَّ زَيْدًا and ثُمَّ زَيْدًا, both meaning the same [i. e. <i>I saw &#39;Amr: then Zeyd</i>]: (TA:) and in like manner one says فُمَّتَ and فُمَّتْ, meaning تُمَّتَ and تُمَّتْ.
