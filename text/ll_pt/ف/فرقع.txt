                  <i>i. q.</i> <br>\

(TA. [See also 2 in art. فقع.]) And one says, سَمِعْتُ <br>\
                  فَرْقَعَةً لِرَجُلٍ and صَرْقَعَةً [<i>I heard a cracking of the joints of the fingers of a man</i>]: both signify the same. (TA.) ―         -b2-  And فَرْقَعَةُ <br>\
                  <i>He twisted his</i> (a man&#39;s, K) <i>neck.</i> (O, K.)       -A2-  فَرْقَعَ [as an intrans. v.], (O, K, TA,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) <i>He ran vehemently,</i> (O, K, TA,) <i>going back,</i> or <i>retreating:</i> so in the Tekmileh. (TA.) ―         -b2-  And فِرْقَاعٌ (as an inf. n. of which the verb is فَرْقَعَ, TK) signifies The <i>emitting of wind from the anus with a sound:</i> (O, K:) mentioned by IDrd as from some one or more of the Arabs.

                  <i>The man drew himself together,</i> or <i>shrank;</i> like تَقَرْعَفَ [which is mentioned in the K in the same sense, as also تَقَرْفَعَ]. (L, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   see Q. 2, in two places. ―         -b2-  الاِفْرِنْقَاعُ also signifies <i>The withdrawing,</i> or <i>removing,</i> and <i>going away,</i> from a thing (عَنْ شَىْءٍ); (K;) and <i>the dispersing of itself,</i> or <i>becoming dispersed.</i> (IAth, TA.) اِفْرَنْقِعُوا عَنِّى, a phrase used by &#39;Eesà Ibn- &#39;Omar, (S, O,) to people who had congregated about him on an occasion of his having fallen from his ass, (O,) means <i>Withdraw ye,</i> or <i>remove,</i> (S,) or <i>disperse yourselves,</i> (O,) <i>from me,</i> (S,) and <i>go away.</i> (S, O.)
