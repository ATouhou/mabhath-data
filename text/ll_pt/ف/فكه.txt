                  <i>He ate fruit</i> (فَاكِهَة): (Msb, K:) and <i>He took fruit with his hand,</i> [<i>he helped himself to it;</i>] syn. تَنَاوَلَ الفَاكِهَةَ: and hence, as is said in the A, (TA,) the saying in the Kur [lvi. 65], فَظَلْتُمْ تَفَكَّهُونَ is ironical, meaning [<i>And then ye would be in the condition of</i>] <i>making your fruit to be your saying</i> <br>\

                  <i>Verily we are burdened with debt</i> (which words occur in the next verse)]: or تَفَكَّهَ here [or rather in a case of this kind] means <i>He threw away from himself the fruit:</i> thus says Ibn-&#39;Ateeyeh, (K, TA,) in his exposition: (TA:) [but see other explanations in what follows:] and it signifies also <i>He abstained from fruit:</i> thus it bears two contr. meanings. (K.) ―         -b2-  And sometimes [it means (tropical:)  <i>He amused himself with talk;</i> like as one amuses himself with the eating of fruit after a meal; i. e.] التَّفَكُّهُ is metaphorically used as meaning التَّنَقُّلُ بِالحَدِيثِ. (Bd in lvi. 65.) ―         -b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  <i>He affected jesting,</i> or <i>joking.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  And تفكّهوا بِفُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:) <i>They spoke evil of such a one;</i> or <i>did so in his absence;</i> and <i>defamed him;</i> and <i>did thus with jesting, one with another.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  And تفكّه بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He enjoyed it:</i> (S, Msb, K:) and [particularly] (Msb) <i>he enjoyed the eating of it.</i> (Mgh, Msb.) ―         -b6-  And تفكّه also signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>He wondered,</i> (S, Msb, K,) مِنْهُ at it; and so ↓ <br>\
      فَكِهَ, followed likewise by منه. (K.) And hence [accord. to some] the saying in the Kur cited above, فَظَلْتُمْ تَفَكَّهُونَ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [<i>And then ye would be in the condition of</i>] <i>wondering</i> at what had befallen you in respect of your seed-produce. (TA.) ―         -b7-  And <i>He repented, grieved, lamented,</i> or <i>regretted:</i> (IAar, S, K:) and the words of the Kur cited in the last sentence above, (S, TA,) as expl. by some, (TA,) mean [<i>And then ye would be in the condition of</i>] <i>repenting,</i> &amp;amp;c.: (S, TA:) and so تَفَكَّنُونَ, which is of the dial. of &#39;Okl; or, accord. to Lh, Temeem say تَتَفَكَّنُونَ, and AzdShanoo-ah say تَتَفَكَّهُونَ.

      فَاكِهِينَ [is the more common reading and] means <i>enjoying an easy and a pleasant life;</i> or <i>enjoying case and plenty.</i> (S, Mgh.) ―         -b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  <i>Wondering:</i> and thus some explain the pl. فَكِهُونَ in the Kur xxxvi. 55. (TA.) ―         -b5-  هُوَ فَكِهٌ بِاَعْرَاضِ النَّاسِ means (tropical:)  <i>He is one who delights in speaking evil of men,</i> or <i>in doing so in their absence.</i> (K, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
