[who has been given] a little: (S, O, K:) the origin of the saying was this: two men passed the night at the abode of an Arab of the desert, and, meeting in the morning, one of them asked his companion respecting the entertainment given by the host, and the latter answered, “ I was not entertained as a guest, but only a vein [of a camel] was slit [or opened] to draw blood for me; ” whereupon the other replied in the words above: (O, K:) or a man used to entertain another as his guest in a time of scarcity, and, having no food to offer him, and being unwilling to slaughter his camel, bled it by slitting [or opening] a vein, and heated the blood that came forth, for his guest, until it became thick, and gave it to him to eat; and hence this prov.: (M, L:) it is applied to him who has obtained a part of that which he wanted.
