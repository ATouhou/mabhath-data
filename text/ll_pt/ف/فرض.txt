      فرّضهُ, inf. n. تَفْرِيضٌ: (K:) or this last signifies <i>he notched it much;</i> or <i>made notches in it;</i> (S, O, TA;) or you say, فَرَضَ قَوْسَهُ and فَرَّضَ قِسِيَّهُ: (A:) and فَرَضَهُ signifies <i>he notched it with his teeth;</i> namely, a tooth-stick: (As:) and <i>he cut it;</i> namely, a thing; or a hard thing; which is said by some to be the primary signification: (TA:) and <i>he</i> (a tailor) <i>cut it out;</i> namely a garment: (Kull p. 275:) and <i>he cut it out and made it round;</i> namely a shield: (TA:) and فَرْضٌ also signifies the <i>cutting,</i> or <i>dividing, lengthwise; cleaving;</i> or <i>the like;</i> applied in a general manner; or the <i>making a trench,</i> or <i>an oblong excavation, in the middle of a grave;</i> <br>\
                  فَرَضْتُ لِلْمَيِّتِ signifying <i>I made a trench,</i> or <i>an oblong excavation, in the middle of a grave, for the corpse.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  فَرَضَ لَهُ, [aor. and] inf. n. as above, (K, &amp;amp;c.,) <i>He apportioned to him</i> [a thing]: <i>he appointed to him</i> [a thing]: (Bd in xxxiii. 38, and TA: *) because that which is apportioned, or appointed, [to a person] is cut off from the thing from which it is apportioned, or appointed: (TA:) <i>he made</i> [a thing] <i>lawful,</i> or <i>allowable, to him;</i> (Jel in xxxiii. 38, and Kull in p. 275, and TA; *) relating to a case into which a man has brought himself: (Kull:) this is said to be the meaning when the phrase فَرَضَ <br>\
                  اْللّٰهُ لَهُ occurs in the Kur: (TA:) <i>he appointed,</i> or <i>assigned, to him a definite portion;</i> (K;) as also له ↓ <br>\
      افرض. (O, L, K.) You say فَرَضَ لَهُ فِى <br>\
                  العَطَا=ءِ [<i>He appointed,</i> or <i>assigned, to him a definite portion in the gift</i>]. (As, S.) And فَرَضَ <br>\

      افرضهُ, (S, K,) <i>He gave to him.</i> (S, O, K.) ―         -b2-  فَرَضَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb,) aor. as above, (TA,) and so the inf. n., (Msb, TA,) also signifies <i>He</i> (God, S, A, Mgh, Msb) <i>made</i> a thing, (S, TA,) or prayer, (A, Mgh,) or statutes or ordinances, (Msb,) <i>obligatory,</i> or <i>binding,</i> syn. اَوْجَبَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, TA,) <i>by a known decree,</i> (TA,) [or <i>He imposed a thing</i> &amp;amp;c.,] عَلَى اـِنْسَانٍ <br>\

                  <i>on us;</i> (S;) and so ↓ <br>\
      اِفْتَرَضَ: (S, A, Mgh, O, K:) or فَرْضٌ is like اـِيجَابٌ; but the latter is so termed in consideration of its befalling; and the former is so called in consideration of the sentence, or decree, respecting it: (B:) [this is said in books on the law, in explanation of the opinion of Aboo-Haneefeh, as opposed to that of Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee: for] accord. to Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, these two terms are alike; (L, TA;) but accord. to Aboo-Haneefeh, the difference between الوَاجِبُ and الفَرْضُ is like the difference between heaven and earth: (TA:) this distinction, however, is founded upon contested derivations of the two terms: (Kull p. 276:) and it is said that wherever the phrase فَرَضَ اْللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ occurs, it means اـِيجَابٌ. (TA.) Also <i>He</i> (the apostle of God) <i>instituted,</i> or <i>prescribed,</i> [a thing <i>as a statute,</i> or <i>an ordinance,</i> or <i>a command</i> or <i>prohibition;</i>] syn. سَنَّ; (O, K;) on the authority of IAar alone: (O, TA:) but accord. to others, <i>he made necessarily obligatory</i> or <i>binding;</i> and this, says Az, is the obvious meaning. (TA.) Also <i>He</i> (a judge) <i>decreed,</i> or <i>adjudged,</i> [TA.) Also <i>He</i> (a judge) <i>decreed,</i> or <i>adjudged,</i> [a thing, as, for instance,] expenses [&amp;amp;c.]. (Msb.) Also <i>He assigned,</i> or <i>appointed, a particular time for doing</i> a thing; or <i>he determined, defined,</i> or <i>limited,</i> a thing <i>as to time,</i> or <i>otherwise;</i> the inf. n., فَرْضٌ, being syn. with تَوْقِيتٌ: (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, A, O, K:) as in the phrase فَمَنْ فَرَضَ فِيهِنَّ الحَجَّ [<i>And whoso determineth the performance of the pilgrimage therein</i>]; (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, O, K;) occurring in the Kur [ii. 193]; and in like manner it is expl. by Ibn- &#39;Arafeh as occurring in xxxiii. 38 of the Kur (O, TA:) but the phrase quoted above is also expl. as meaning <i>and whoso maketh it obligatory,</i> or <i>binding, on himself to perform the pilgrimage therein,</i> by his entering upon the state of اـِحْرَام. (TA.) ―         -b3-  سُورَةٌ اَنْزَلْنَاهَا وَفَرَضْنَاهَا, (K,) in the Kur, [commencing chap. xxiv.,] (TA,) means [<i>This is a chapter which we have revealed and</i>] <i>in which we have set down the obligatory statutes:</i> (O, K:) or <i>in which we have bound you to do according to what is made obligatory therein:</i> (Az, O:) or, as some read, ↓ <br>\
      وَفَرَّضْنَاهَا, (S, O, K, *) meaning <i>and in which we have set down obligatory statutes,</i> (O, L, K,) <i>one after another:</i> (O, K:) or <i>which we have distinctly explained:</i> (Az, S, O, K:) or <i>we</i> <br>\
                  <i>have distinctly explained what is in it, of lawful and unlawful</i> [<i>things</i>]. (T, TA.) ―         -b4-  فَرْضٌ also signifies The act of <i>reading,</i> or <i>reciting.</i> (IAar, O, K.) You say, فَرَضْتُ جُزْيِى <br>\
                  <i>I read,</i> or <i>recited, my portion.</i> (O, TA.)       -A3-  فَرُضَ, inf. n. فَرَاضَةٌ, <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, skilled in the</i> <br>\
                  فَرَايِض; (A, O, K, TA;) i. e. <i>in the science of the division of inheritances.</i> (TA.) MF says that, accord. to IKtt, the verb is also written فَرَضَ, like كَتَبَ: but [says SM] what I find in his “ Kitáb el-Abniyeh ” is the mention of the two modes of writing in the instance of فرضت said of a cow; and the verb applied to a man he has not mentioned.

      فُرْضَةٌ; (A, TA;) or this is the <i>place of the notch for the string thereof:</i> (Msb:) pl. of the former فِرَاضٌ (S, O, K) and فُرُوضٌ; (TA;) and of the latter فُرَضٌ (Msb, TA) and فِرَاضٌ: (Msb:) also, of a زَنْد, (S, K,) or [rather] of a زَنْدَة, (A,) the <i>notch;</i> (K;) or the <i>place,</i> or <i>part, whence the fire is produced;</i> (S, K;) the <i>hole,</i> or <i>perforation, that is made in the head</i> thereof, <i>into which the</i> <br>\

      مُفْتَرَضٌ: (TA:) pl. فُرُوضٌ. (Msb.) As a law-term, it is of two sorts, فَرْضُ عَيْنٍ and فَرْضُ كِفَايَةٍ: the former is That <i>whereof the observance is obligatory on every one, and does not become of no force in respect of some in consequence of the observance</i> [<i>thereof</i>] <i>by some</i> [<i>others</i>]; as religious belief, and the like: the latter is That <i>whereof the observance is obligatory on the collective body of the Muslims, and, in consequence of the observance</i> [<i>thereof</i>] <i>by some, becomes of no force in respect of the rest;</i> as warring against unbelievers, and the prayer over the dead in the bier.

      مَفْرُوضٌ, and ↓ <br>\

[See also فَرِيضَةٌ.] ―         -b2-  <i>A statute, an ordinance, a command</i> or <i>prohibition,</i> of the Apostle of God; syn. سُنَّةٌ. (IAar, O, K.) [But فَرْضٌ is generally distinguished from سُنَّةٌ: the former, for instance, being applied to prayer appointed in the Kur-án; and the latter, to prayer appointed by Mohammad without allegation of a divine order.] ―         -b3-  <i>A gift,</i> or <i>a soldier&#39;s stipend</i> or <i>pay,</i> syn. عَطَا=ءٌ, (A,) or عَطِيَّةٌ, (S, O, K,) <i>assigned,</i> or <i>appointed.</i> (S, O, K. *) In the copies of the K, مَوْسُومَة is put by mistake for مَرْسُومَة. (TA.) You say, مَا اَصَبْتُ مِنْهُ فَرْضًا وَلَا قَرْضًا <br>\
                  <i>I did not obtain from him an assigned,</i> or <i>appointed, gift,</i> or <i>soldier&#39;s stipend,</i> (S, O, TA,) <i>nor a gift to be requited,</i> or <i>a loan.</i> (O, TA.) And فَرْضٌ also signifies <i>A thing which one makes obligatory,</i> or <i>binding, on himself, and freely gives:</i> or <i>a thing which one gives liberally, not for a recompense.</i> (IDrd, O, K.)       -A3-  Also <i>Soldiers who receive stipends;</i> (K:) so accord. to Lth, as related by Az; but [Sgh says] I have not found it in the book of Lth: (O:) or <i>soldiers having definite portions assigned to them:</i> (A:) pl. فُرُوضٌ. (A, TA.) You say, عِنْدَهُ مِايَةٌ مِنَ الفَرْضِ <br>\
                  <i>He has with him a hundred soldiers</i> &amp;amp;c. (A.)       -A4-  <i>A shield.</i> (S, O, K.) Sakhr-el-Gheí says, describing lightning, (O, TA,) likening it to a light shield which an announcer of tidings was turning over and over with his hands that a party might see it and be gladdened [by the signal], (TA,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>I was sleepless by reason of it, it being</i> (in its flickering) <i>like the signalling of the announcer of tidings turning over and over with the hand a light shield</i>]: one should not say قُرْصًا خفيفا. (S, O, TA: but my copies of the S have قَلَّبَ instead of يُقَلِّبُ.) [See also what follows.] ―         -b2-  And <i>A stick,</i> or <i>piece of wood;</i> syn. عُودٌ; thus [it means] in the verse (فِى البَيْتِ) accord. to El-Jumahee, (O, TA,) i. e. in the verse above-cited: (TA:) he says, الفَرْضُ فِى البَيْتِ عُودٌ: (O, TA:) whence the author of the K has been misled to explain الفَرْضُ as meaning عُودٌ مِنْ اَعْوَادِ البَيْتِ. (TA.) ―         -b3-  And <i>An arrow before it has been furnished with feathers and a head:</i> (Akh, S, O, TA:) a meaning also heard by El-Jumahee: (O, TA:) and to this, in the hand of the player, &#39;Abeed ElAbras has likened lightning, accord. to the S; but Sgh says, in the TS, that he did not find the verse cited by J in the poetry of &#39;Abeed. (TA.) ―         -b4-  And <i>A piece of rag:</i> another explanation heard by El-Jumahee. (O.) ―         -b5-  And <i>A garment,</i> or <i>piece of cloth:</i> (O, K:) a meaning mentioned by As on the authority of some one or more of the Arabs of the desert, of Hudheyl. (O.) [See also فِرَاضٌ.] ―         -b6-  And it is said that in the verse cited above it means the notch in the زَنْد [or rather زَنْدَة, mentioned in the first sentence of this paragraph]. (O, TA.)       -A5-  <i>A sort of dates</i> (S, O, Msb, K) <i>of &#39;Omán:</i> (Msb:) As says that the best dates of &#39;Omán are these and the بَلْعَق: (S, O:) and AHn says, Certain of the desertArabs of &#39;Omán informed me that when the tree thereof has its fruit ripened, and the gathering is delayed, the fruit falls from its stones, and the raceme remains with nothing upon it but stones hanging to the ثَفَارِيق [by which they are attached to the ends of the stalks].
