                  , said of a woman, <i>She walked with an elegant and a proud and self-conceited gait, with an affected inclining of the body from side to side.</i> (Msb.) [See also 5.] ―         -b2-  And, said of the bird called فَاخِتَة, <i>It</i> [<i>cooed,</i> or] <i>uttered a cry</i> or <i>sound.</i> (K.) ―         -b3-  And فَخَتَ <br>\

                  القِدْرَةِ, the reading found in copies of the K, [in the CK من الفِدْرَةِ,] is a mistake: it should be من القِدْرِ, as in the L [and O] &amp;amp;c. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   The <i>light of the moon; moonlight:</i> (S, A, O, K:) or the <i>light of the moon when it first appears:</i> and hence [as some say] the derivation of فَاخِتَةٌ [as the name of a certain bird], because of its colour: (Msb: [see, however, what follows:]) you say, جَلَسْنَا فِى الفَخْتِ [as though meaning <i>We sat in the moonlight</i>]: (A &#39;Obeyd, S, O:) but Sh says, I have not heard الفِخْت except in this instance; and Aboo-Is-hák states that some one of the lexicologists says, I know not whether it be a name of the <i>light of the moon</i> or of <i>its darkness:</i> Abu-l-&#39;Abbás says that the meaning [in the saying above mentioned] is, <i>in the shade of the moon</i> [i. e. <i>in the shade of a moonlight-night;</i> and to this the colour of the فَاخِتَة may be likened].

                  <i>A certain well-known bird;</i> (K;) <i>of those having neck-rings</i> [or <i>collars</i>]; (S, O;) <i>a species of pigeon, marked with a neck-ring:</i> (TA:) accord. to Ibn-El-Jawáleekee, (IB, TA,) the name is derived from الفَخْتُ, (IB, Msb, TA,) meaning “ the light of the moon, ” (IB, TA,) or “ the light of the moon when it first appears; ” because of its colour: (Msb:) [hence, and from what will be found stated voce قُمْرِىٌّ, it seems to be <i>a species of collared turtle-dove, of a dull white colour, marked with a black neck-ring:</i>] or, as some say, the word is a part. n. from فَخَتَتْ signifying as expl. in the first sentence of this art.: (Msb:) the pl. is فَوَاخِتُ.

                  مِنْ فَاخِتَةٍ [<i>More lying than a fákhiteh</i>] is a prov.; because the cry of the فاختة resembles هٰذَا اَوَانُ <br>\
