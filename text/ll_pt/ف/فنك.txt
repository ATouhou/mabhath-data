                  <i>He persisted,</i> or <i>persevered, in lying:</i> asserted by Yaakoob to be formed by transposition from فَكَنَ: and Aboo-Tálib says that ↓ <br>\
      فانك and ↓ <br>\
      فنّك, of which latter the inf. n. is تَفْنِيكٌ, signify <i>he persisted,</i> or <i>persevered,</i> in lying, and in evil; not in good; and denote the like of consecutiveness. (TA.) [See also فَنْكٌ, which may be an inf. n. of فَنَكَ in this sense, and in others.] And فَنَكَ عَلَيْهِ, (K, TA,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) signifies [in like manner] <i>He kept,</i> or <i>applied himself, constantly, perseveringly,</i> or <i>assiduously, to it;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      افنك.

      فَانَكْتُ <br>\
                  وَالشَّرَابَ signifies [simply] <i>I kept continually,</i> or <i>constantly, to the food and the beverage:</i> and also <i>I loathed them,</i> or <i>turned away from them with disgust.</i> (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.) ―         -b4-  And فَنَكَ فِى الاَمْرِ [not فانك as in the lexicons of Golius and Freytag, the latter of whom gives both forms of the v. in the sense here following, as does also the TK,] signifies also <i>He entered into the affair.</i> (K.) ―         -b5-  And <i>He mastered the affair,</i> and <i>overcame it.</i> (O.) ―         -b6-  فَنَكْتَ فِى لَوْمِى, and فيه ↓ <br>\
      افنكت, (both in the TA, but the latter only in the O,) <i>Thou wast,</i> or <i>hast become, skilled in the blaming,</i> or <i>censuring, of me, and profuse,</i> or <i>immoderate, therein:</i> so says Fr. (O, TA.) ―         -b7-  And فَنَكَتْ and ↓ <br>\

This meaning has also been assigned to فَتَكَتْ. (TA.) ―         -b9-  And فَنَكَ, (K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) <i>He lied,</i> or <i>said what was untrue;</i> as also ↓ <br>\

      فَنِيكٌ as signifying <i>an animal like the fox;</i> an arabicized word; from [a work entitled] غَايَة البَيَان; and he says that it appears to be the فَنَك that is mentioned in the K. (TA.) ―         -b2-  See also فَنْكٌ.    </entryFree> <br>\

      الاـِفْنِيكُ; (Lth, O;) [and in like manner Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee explained what is meant by the upper فَنِيك as is stated by IF and in the O:] or <i>the extremity</i> [<i>of each</i>] <i>of the</i> <br>\

The lower فَنِيك is [app. <i>The symphysis of the pubes;</i> being] said by Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee to be <i>the part where the two hip-bones meet together:</i> (IF, O:) [hence, perhaps, and therefore it may be erroneously,] the فنيك is said by AA to be <i>the root,</i> or <i>base, of the tail:</i> (TA:) and it signifies, as also ↓ <br>\
