                  , (T, S, M, &amp;amp;c.,) aor. يَفْدِيهِ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. فِدَا=ءٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, K,) [omitted in my copy of the Msb, probably by inadvertence,]) and فَدًى, (Mgh,) or فِدًى, (so in the M, accord. to the TT,) or also both of these, (Fr, T, S, Msb, K,) the latter of them said by Fr, on one occasion, to be the more common, (T, TA,) [which is the case when it is a subst., like فِدْيَةٌ,] but &#39;Alee Ibn-Suleymán El-Akhfash [i. e. El-Akhfash El-Asghar] is related to have said that this is not allowable except by poetic license, and El-Kálee says that الفِدَى was used by the Arabs in conjunction with الحِمَى, [see حِمَا=ءُ, in art. حمى,] but other forms were used in other cases [among which he seems to mention فَدَا=ء, with fet-h and the lengthened alif, but the words in which I find this expressed are somewhat ambiguous, and are also rendered doubtful by an erasure and an alteration]; (TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      افتداهُ, (M,) [whence an ex. in a verse which will be found in what follows,] or بِهِ ↓ <br>\
      افتدى (K, TA) and مِنْهُ, (TA,) [but I do not know افتدى in either of these phrases as having any other than the well-known meaning of فَدَى نَفْسَهُ, which is strangely omitted in the K;] and know ↓ <br>\
      فادِاهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,) inf. n. مُفَادَاةٌ and فِدَا=ءٌ; (Msb, TA;) but some explain this differently [as will be shown in what follows]; (T, Mgh, Msb, TA;) <i>He gave his ransom;</i> (S;) <i>he gave a thing,</i> (K, TA, [اَعْطاهُ in the CK being a mistake for اَعْطَى, without the affixed pronoun,]) or <i>a captive, for him,</i> (TA,) <i>and so liberated him;</i> (K, TA;) [i. e. <i>he ransomed him;</i>] or <i>he liberated him,</i> or <i>ransomed him,</i> <br>\
                  مِنَ الاَسْرِ [<i>from captivity</i>]: (Mgh, Msb:) or ↓ <br>\
      فاداهُ signifies <i>he loosed him,</i> or <i>set him free, and took his ransom:</i> (Mgh, Msb, TA:) or مُفَادَاةٌ signifies the <i>giving</i> a man <i>and taking</i> a man [<i>in exchange</i>]: and فِدَا=ءٌ, [as inf. n. of فَدَاهُ,] the <i>purchasing</i> him [<i>from captivity</i> or <i>the like</i>]: (Mbr, T, Mgh, Msb, TA:) or the <i>preserving</i> a man <i>from misfortune by what one gives by way of compensation for him;</i> as also فَدًى: (Er-Rághib, TA:) you say, فَدَيْتُهُ بِمَالِى <br>\
                  <i>I purchased</i> [i. e. <i>ransomed</i>] <i>him with my property,</i> and بِنَفْسِى <br>\
                  <i>with myself:</i> (T:) or, accord. to Nuseyr Er-Rázee, the Arabs say, الاَسِيرَ ↓ <br>\
      فَادَيْتُ [<i>I ransomed the captive</i>], and فَدَيْتُهُ بِاَبِى وَ اُمِى [<i>I ransomed him</i> in a tropical sense <i>with my father and my mother</i>], and بِمَالٍ [<i>with property</i>], as though thou purchasedst him and freedst him therewith, when he was not a captive; and you may say, فَدَيْتُ <br>\
                  الاَسيرَ meaning <i>I freed the captive from the state in which he was,</i> though ↓ <br>\
      فَادَيْتُ is better in this sense: as to the reading تَفْدُوهُمْ [in the Kur ii. 79], Aboo-Mo&#39;ádh says, it means <i>Ye purchase them from the enemy and liberate them;</i> but the reading ↓ <br>\
      تُفَادُوهُمْ, he says, means <i>ye contend with them who are in your hands respecting the price and they so contend with you:</i> (T, TA:) [that ↓ <br>\
      افتداهُ is syn. with فَدَاهُ is shown by what here follows:] a poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        يُفْتَدَى لَفَدَيْتُهُ فَلَوْ كَانَ مَيتٌ<br>\

                        بِمَا لَمْ تَكُنْ عَنْهُ النُّفُوسُ تَطِيبُ<br>\
                   [<i>And if a person dead were to be ransomed, assuredly I would ransom him with what minds would not be willing to relinquish</i>]. (M, TA.) ―         -b2-  [The inf. ns. of the first of these verbs are much used in precative phrases:] they said, فَدًى لَكَ [for فَدَاكَ فَدًى, and therefore virtually meaning فُدِيتَ <br>\
                  <i>Mayest thou be ransomed;</i> the ل being لِلتَّبْيِينِ i. e. “ for the purpose of notifying ” the person addressed]: (TA:) and بِى اَ فَدًى لَكَ [for فَدَاكَ اَبِى بِنَفْسِهِ فَدًى, and therefore virtually meaning simply فَدَاكَ اَبِى بِنَفْسِهِ <br>\
                  <i>May my father ransom thee with himself;</i> so that it may be well rendered <i>may my father be a ransom for thee</i>]: (S:) and فِدَا=ء, with tenween, some of the Arabs pronounce with kesr [to the ء, i. e. they pronounce فِدَا=ء with the tenween of kesr], peculiarly when it is next to [meaning immediately followed by] the preposition ل, saying فِدَا=ءٍ لَكَ, because it is indeterminate; they intending thereby the meaning of a prayer; and As has cited [as an ex. thereof] the saying of En-Nábighah [Edh-Dhubyánee], <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        مَهْلًا فِدَا=ءٍ لَكَ الاَقْوَامُ كُلُّهُمُ<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَمَا اُثَمِرُ مِنْ مَالٍ وَمِنْ وَلَدِ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>Act gently: may the peoples, all of them, and what I make to be abundant of wealth and of offspring, give themselves as a ransom,</i> or <i>be a ransom, for thee:</i> <br>\
                  فِدَا=ءٍ being app. assimilated to an indeterminate imperative verbal noun such as صَهٍ in the phrase صَهٍ يَا رَجُلُ, which is as though one said اُسْكُتْ سُكُوتًا يَا رَجُلُ; thus meaning here لِيَفْدِكَ: but De Sacy mentions, in his “ Chrest. Arabe, ” see. ed., vol. ii., p. 460, three allowable readings (not the foregoing reading) in this verse, namely, فدا=ءٌ and فدا=ءً and فدا=ءٍ; and adds that what here follows is said by a commentator to be, of several explanations, that which is the right: والقول الا=خر وهو الصحيح ان فدا=ءِ بمعنى <br>\
                  ليُفدِكَ فبناه كما بنى الامر وكذلك تَراكِ و دَراكِ لانه <br>\
                  بمعنى اترك و ادرك: this, it will be observed, is similar to the explanation which I have offered of فِدَا=ءٍ لك; for ليُفدِك is app. a typographical mistake for ليَفدِك: and I incline to think that فدا=ءِ, though supposed to be correct and therefore likened to تَراكِ and دَراكِ, is a mistake of a copyist for فدا=ءٍ; and the more so because I find in Ahlwardt&#39;s “ Divans of the Six Ancient Arabic Poets ” the three readings فِداءٌ and فِداءً and فِداءٍ, but not فِداءِ]. (S, TA.) ―         -b3-  وَفَدَيْنَاهُ بِذِبْحٍ [in the Kur xxxvii. 107] means <i>And we made an animal prepared for sacrifice to be a ransom for him, and freed him from slaughter.</i> (T, TA.) ―         -b4-  فَدَتْ <br>\
                  نَفْسَهَا مِنْ زَوْجِهَا and ↓ <br>\
      افتدت [alone] mean <i>She gave property to her husband so that she became free from him by divorce.</i> (Msb, TA.) ―         -b5-  See also what next follows.    </entryFree> <br>\

                   see 1, former half, in five places. ―         -b2-  In the saying respecting bloodwits, وَاـِنْ اَحَبُّوا فَادَوْا, the meaning is, [<i>And if they like,</i>] <i>they free the slayer,</i> or <i>his next of kin who is answerable for him, and accept the bloodwit;</i> because this is a substitute for the blood, like as the ransom is a substitute for the captive.

                   [in the CK (erroneously) الاسيرُ] <i>He accepted from him the ransom of the captive.</i> (M, K.) Hence the saying of the Prophet to Kureysh, when &#39;Othmán Ibn-&#39;Abd-Allah and El- Hakam Ibn-Keysán had been made captives, لَا <br>\

                  <i>Such a one danced,</i> or <i>dandled, his child:</i> (K, TA:) because of his [often] saying, فَدِى لَكَ اَبِى وَ اُمِى [<i>May my father and my mother be ransoms for thee</i>]. (TA.)       -A2-  افدى also signifies <i>He made for his dried dates a store-chamber.</i> (K.) ―         -b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  <i>He became large in his body;</i> (IAar, T, K, TA;) as though it became like the فَدَا=ء [q. v.].

                  <i>They ransomed one another.</i> (S, TA.) ―         -b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  <i>They guarded themselves, one by another;</i> as though every one of them made his fellow to be his ransom. (Msb, TA.) ―         -b3-  And تفادى مِنْهُ (tropical:)  <i>He guarded against it,</i> or <i>was cautious of it, and kept aloof from it.</i> (S, K, * TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

You say, افتدى مِنْهُ بِكَذَا [<i>He ransomed himself from him with such a thing</i>]. (S.) Hence the usage of the verb in the Kur ii. 229. (TA.) See 1, last sentence but one.    </entryFree> <br>\
