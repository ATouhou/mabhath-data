                  , (Msb, TA,) aor. يَفْحُو [like يَعْلُو], the verb being of the class of عَلَى, (so in the Msb accord. to the TA,) or يَفْحَى [like يَنْفَعُ], the verb being of the class of نَفَعَ, (so accord. to my copy of the Msb,) or, as in copies of the T, يَفْحِى, without teshdeed, the verb being of the class of رَمَى, (TA, [but this is app. a mistranscription for يَفْحَى, as the last radical letter is و,]) inf. n. فَحْوٌ; (Msb, TA;) or بكلامه ↓ <br>\

      لَيُفَحِّى;] <i>He meant,</i> or <i>intended, by his saying,</i> or <i>speech, such a thing.</i> (Msb, K, TA. [In the S, the meaning is only indicated by the context.])       -A2-  بَكَى حَتَّى فَحِىَ, like رَضِىَ, <i>He</i> (a child) <i>wept until he sobbed.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  اَبَازِير [or <i>seeds used in cooking, for seasoning the food:</i> from فَحًا, q. v.]: (S, * K, TA:) or, accord. to Aboo- &#39;Alee El-Kálee, <i>he put,</i> or <i>threw, into the cookingpot,</i> <br>\
                  اَبَازِير, i. e. تَوَابِل. (TA.) It is said, by Z, [but with hardly any reason that I can see,] to be formed by transposition from the letters فوح thus combined. (TA.)       -A2-  See also 1, in two places.    </entryFree> <br>\

      فَحْوَا=ءُ: or the <i>dry thereof:</i> (K:) pl. اَفْحَا=ءٌ; (S, K;) which is said by IAth to signify the [<i>seeds called</i>] تَوَابِل <br>\
                  <i>of the cooking-pot, such as pepper</i> and <i>cumin-seed</i> and <i>the like thereof.</i> (TA.) And it is said to signify particularly The <i>onion,</i> or <i>onions</i> collectively. (TA.) Thus in a trad. of Mo&#39;áwiyeh, in which he is related to have said to a party who came to him, كُلُوا مِنْ فَحَا اَرْضِنَا <br>\
                  فَقَلَّ مَا اَكَلَ قَوْمٌ مِنْ فَحَا اَرْضٍ فَضَرَّهُمْ مَاوُهَا [<i>Eat ye of the seasoning of our land</i> (meaning of the onions,) <i>for rarely have people eaten of the seasoning of a land and the water thereof has harmed them</i>].

      فِحِّيَّةٌ, like جِرِّيَّةٌ (accord. to those who hold this to be of the  measure فِعِّيلَةٌ, not فِعْلِيَّةٌ); i. e., that it is originally فِحِّيوَةٌ, the و being necessarily changed into ى and incorporated into the preceding ى;] and also ↓ <br>\
      فَحِيَّةٌ; (K, TA;) the former on the authority of AA, and the latter on that of IAar; (TA;) <i>Thin soup:</i> (K, TA: [in some copies of the K, حَشْو is erroneously put for حَسْو or حَسُوّ, the readings in other copies:]) or <i>soup in general.</i> (K, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
