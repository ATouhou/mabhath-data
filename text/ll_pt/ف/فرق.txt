                  , (Msb, TA,) inf. n. فَرْغٌ and فُرْقَانٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) the latter of which has a more intensive signification, (TA,) <i>He made a separation,</i> or <i>a distinction,</i> or <i>difference,</i> (Msb, K, TA,) <i>between the two things,</i> (K, * TA,) or <i>between the parts of the two things:</i> (Msb:) relating alike to objects of sight and to objects of mental perception: (TA:) IAar, by exs. that he mentions, makes it to relate particularly to objects of the mind, such as sayings; and ↓ <br>\
      فرّق, to persons, or material things: (Msb: [and it is stated in the Mgh that the same distinction is mentioned by Az:]) others, however, state that the two verbs are syn.; but that the latter has an intensive signification. (Msb.) It is said in the Kur [v. 28], فَاْفْرُقْ بَيْنَنَا <br>\
                  وَبَيْنَ اْلْقَوْمِ الفَاسِقِينَ [<i>Therefore decide Thou,</i> or <i>make Thou a distinction, between us and the unrighteous people</i>]: accord. to one reading, فَاْفْرِقْ. (Msb, TA.) فِيهَا يُفْرَقُ كُلُّ اَمْرٍ حَكِيمٍ, in the Kur [xliv. 3], means [<i>Wherein</i>] <i>is made distinct</i> [<i>every firm decree</i>]: (Lth, TA:) or <i>is decided;</i> (O, K, TA;) thus expl. by Katádeh. (O, TA.) And in the phrase وَقُرا=نًا فَرَقْنَاهُ, (S, O, K, TA,) in the same [xvii. 107], (S, O, TA,) by فَرَقْنَاهُ is meant <i>We have made it distinct,</i> (S, O, K, TA,) <i>and rendered it free from defect,</i> (O, K, TA,) <i>and explained the ordinances therein:</i> (TA:) but some read ↓ <br>\
      فَرَّقْنَاهُ, meaning <i>We have sent it down in sundry portions, in a number of days.</i> (S, TA.) وَاـِذْ فَرَقْنَا بِكُمُ اْلْبَحْرَ, (O, K, TA,) in the Kur [ii. 47], (O, TA,) means <i>And when we clave because of you the sea; i. q.</i> <br>\
                  فَلَقْنَاهُ: (O, K, TA:) another reading, ↓ <br>\
      فَرَّقْنَا, meaning <i>we divided into several portions,</i> is mentioned by IJ; but this is unusual. (TA.) It is also said that الفَرْقُ is for rectification; and ↓ <br>\
      التَّفْرِيقُ, for vitiation: and IJ says that دِيْنَهُمْ ↓ <br>\
      اـِنَّ اْلَّذِينَ فَرَّقُوا, in the Kur [vi. 160, and the like occurs in xxx. 31], means <i>Verily those who have divided their religion into sundry parts, and dismembered it, and have disagreed respecting it among themselves:</i> but that some read فَرَقُوا دِيْنَهُمْ, without teshdeed, meaning, <i>have severed their religion from the other religions</i> [app. <i>by taking it in part,</i> or <i>parts, therefrom</i>]; or this, he says, may mean the same as the former reading, for sometimes فَعَلَ has the same meaning as فَعَّلَ. (TA.) IJ also says that فَرَقَ لَهُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ signifies <i>He made the thing distinct,</i> or <i>plain, to him.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  فَرَقَ الشَّعْرَ بِالمُشْطِ, aor.      <br>\

      فَرَّقَ, inf. n. تَفْرِيقٌ, <i>He separated the hair of his head with the comb.</i> (TA.) [And it is implied in a trad. cited in the O and TA that فَرَقَهُ signifies the same as the latter of the two phrases in the next preceding sentence.]       -A2-  فَرَقَ لَهُ الطَّرِيقُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. فُرُوقٌ, (K,) <i>The road presented itself to him divided into two roads:</i> (S, O, K, TA:) or [it means] <i>an affair presented itself,</i> or <i>occurred, to him, and he knew the mode,</i> or <i>manner, thereof:</i> (TA, as from the K: [but not in the CK nor in my MS. copy of the K:]) and hence, in a trad. of I&#39;Ab, فَرَقَ لِى رَاْىٌ <br>\
                  <i>An idea,</i> or <i>opinion, appeared</i> [or <i>occurred</i>] <i>to me:</i> (TA:) [or] one says, فَرَقَ لِى هٰذَا الاَمْرُ, inf. n. فُرُوقٌ, <i>This affair became,</i> or <i>has become, distinct, apparent,</i> or <i>manifest, to me:</i> and hence the saying, فَاـِنْ لَمْ يُفْرُقْ لِلْاـِمَامِ رَاْىٌ [<i>And if an idea,</i> or <i>an opinion, appear not,</i> or <i>occur not, to the Imám</i>].

                  مِنْكَ [<i>I feared thee,</i> or <i>was in fear of thee</i>]: (S, O, Msb: *) but you should not say, فَرِقْتُكَ: (S, O:) Sb [however] mentions فَرِقَهُ, suppressing مِنْ. (TA.)

                  , inf. n. تَفْرِيقٌ and تَفْرِقَةٌ, (S, O, K,) <i>He separated it</i> [<i>into several,</i> or <i>many, portions</i>]; <i>disunited it</i> [i. e. a thing, or a collection of things]; or <i>dispersed,</i> or <i>dissipated, it;</i> or did so <i>much</i> [or <i>greatly</i> or <i>widely</i>]; syn. بَدَّدَهُ. (K.) And فرّق بَيْنَ <br>\

                  <i>He scattered,</i> or <i>distributed, it among them,</i> and <i>to them.</i>] See 1, former half, in five places. It is said in a trad. of &#39;Omar, فَرِّقُوا عَنِ المَنِيَّةِ وَاْجْعَلُوا <br>\
                  الرَّاْسَ رَاْسَيْنِ, (Mgh, O, *) meaning <i>Separate ye</i> your cattle by way of preservation <i>from death,</i> [<i>and make the one head two head,</i>] by buying two animals with the price of one, that, when one dies, the second may remain. (Mgh, O.) And it is said in a trad. respecting the poor-rate, لَا <br>\
                  يُفَرَّقُ بَيْنَ مُجْتَمِعٍ وَلَا يُجْمَعُ بَيْنَ مُفْتَرِقٍ <br>\

                  <i>there be a putting together what is separate.</i> (TA. [The reason is, that by either of these acts, in the case of cattle, the amount of the poor-rate may be diminished.]) يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ اْلْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ [in the Kur ii. 96, meaning <i>Whereby they might dissolve, break up, discompose, derange, disorganize, disorder,</i> or <i>unsettle, the state of union subsisting between the man and his wife, in respect of affairs and of the expression of opinion,</i> or, briefly, <i>whereby they might cause division and dissension between the man and his wife,</i>] is from التَفْرِيقُ as meaning تَشْتِيتُ الشَّمْلِ وَالكَلِمَةِ. (El-Isbahánee, TA.) One says also, فرّق الاَمْرَ, meaning شَتَّتَهُ [i. e. <i>He discomposed, deranged, disorganized, disordered,</i> or <i>unsettled, the state of affairs</i>]. (S in art. شت.) And فرّق عَلَيْنَا الكَلَامَ [lit. <i>He scattered speech</i> (app. meaning <i>he jabbered</i>) <i>at us,</i> or <i>against us</i>]. (K in art. بق: see R. Q. 1 in that art.) In the saying in the Kur [ii. 130 and iii. 78], لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ اَحَدٍ مِنْهُمْ [<i>We will not make a distinction between any of them</i>], the verb is allowably made to relate to احد because this word [in negative phrases] imports a pl. meaning. (TA. [See p. 27, 3rd col.]) See, again, 1, near the middle.       -A2-  فرّقهُ, (O, TA,) inf. n. تَفْرِيقٌ, (O, K, TA,) also signifies <i>He made him to fear,</i> or <i>be afraid; put him in fear;</i> or <i>frightened him:</i> (O, K, * TA:) and مِنْهُ ↓ <br>\
