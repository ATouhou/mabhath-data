                     ذ<br>\
                   means يَسْتَكْرِمُهَا [i. e. <i>He seeks the horses,</i> or <i>mares, that are of generous race</i>]: (aK, TA:) and the like is said in the A, but with الدَّوَابَّ in the place of الافراس. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>فَرِهٌ</b>               1     <br>\

                   [part. n. of فَرِهَ, meaning <i>Exulting,</i> or <i>rejoicing above measure;</i> &amp;amp;c.]. In the Kur xxvi. 149, some read فَرِهِينَ, from فَرِهَ, signifying as expl. above: others reading فَارِهِينَ, which is from فَرُهَ: (S, TA:) ―         -b2-  but فَرِهٌ is also <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  فَارِهٌ, as an epithet applied to a youth, or young man, or male slave; and thus the reading of فَرِهِينَ in the Kur has been expl. as meaning <i>Possessing skill.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  فُرَاتٌ, as an epithet applied to water, signifying <i>Sweet,</i> &amp;amp;c.: both are chaste forms, and well known, like تَابُوهٌ and تَابُوتٌ: so in the Towsheeh. (MF and TA in art. فرت.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   [app. an inf. n., but mentioned as a simple subst., meaning] <i>Skilfulness.</i> (K.) ―         -b2-  And فُرُوهَهٌ and ↓ <br>\

      فَرَاهِيَةٌ denote a  quality of a hackney and of a mule and of an ass, (S,) or of a horse, or similar beast, &amp;amp;c., (Msb,) all signifying <i>Briskness, liveliness, sprightliness, activity, agility,</i> or <i>lightness.</i> (Msb, TA. *)    </entryFree> <br>\

<b>فَارِهٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     فَارِهٌ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>Skilful,</i> or <i>possessing skill;</i> (S, Msb, K;) part. n. of فَرُهَ, irregularly formed, for by rule it should be فَرِيهٌ: (S:) accord. to Z, it is applied to a man; and also, without ة, to a قَيْنَة [i. e. female slave, or slave-songstress]. (Msb.) ―         -b2-  And it is applied as an epithet to a hackney, (Az, S, Msb,) and a mule, (S,) and an ass, (Az, S, Msb,) or to a horse, or similar beast, (Az,) meaning <i>Brisk, lively, sprightly, active, agile,</i> or <i>light;</i> (Az, * Msb;) <i>sharp; strong; that goes,</i> or <i>journeys, much; a great goer:</i> (Az, TA:) it is not applied to a فَرَس, (Az, S,) i. e. to an Arabian horse; (Az, Msb;) such being termed جَوَادٌ, (Az, S, Msb,) and رَايِعٌ: (S:) &#39;Adee Ibn-Zeyd has applied it to the latter; but As has charged him with error in so doing; saying that he possessed not knowledge of horses: (S:) the pl. is فُرْهٌ, (S, Msb,) like بُزْلٌ and حُولٌ pls. of بَازِلٌ and حَايِلٌ, (S,) or فُرُهٌ, like كُتُبٌ, (K,) and فَرَهَةٌ, with two fet-hahs, (Msb,) or فُرْهَةٌ, (S, K,) but this is held by Sb to be a quasi-pl. n., (ISd, TA,) and فُرَّهٌ, like رُكَّعٌ, and فُرَّهَةٌ, like سُكَّرَةٌ, (K,) as in the A, but MF says that no pl. of this measure is known. (TA.) ―         -b3-  Also, applied to a غُلَام [i. e. youth, young man, or male slave], <i>Beautiful,</i> or <i>comely, of countenance.</i> (IAar, TA.) And [the fem.] فَارِهَةٌ signifies A <i>beautiful,</i> or <i>comely,</i> girl, or young woman: (K:) [and] so ↓ <br>\
      فَرْهَا=ءُ, [of which the masc. is اَفْرَهُ, and] of which the pl. is فُرْهٌ; but Az says, I do not think that they use this word in relation to girls, or young women, though they may apply it peculiarly to female slaves like as they apply فَارِهٌ and فَارِهَةٌ peculiarly to hackneys and mules and jades, exclusively of Arabian horses. (Msb.) ―         -b4-  And فَارِهَةٌ is also syn. with فَتِيَّةٌ [i. e. A <i>youthful</i> females, or one <i>in the prime of life</i>]: (thus accord. to several copies of the K and accord. to the TA:) or قَيْنَةٌ [i. e. <i>a female slave,</i> or <i>a slave-songstress:</i> see the first sentence of this paragraph]. (Thus in the CK.) ―         -b5-  And it signifies also [A woman] <i>who eats vehemently:</i> (K:) and فَارِهٌ applied to man, <i>A vehement eater.</i> (IAar, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                  : see its fem., فَرْهَا=ءُ, in the next preceding paragraph. ―         -b2-  فُلَانٌ اَفْرَهُ مِنْ فُلَانٍ means <i>Such a one is more beautiful,</i> or <i>comely, than such a one.</i> (Msb.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>مُفْرِهٌ</b>               1     <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                   and مُفْرِهَةٌ (S, K) and مُفَرِّهَةٌ (S) are epithets applied to a she-camel, meaning <i>Bringing forth</i> [<i>young ones such as are termed</i>] فُرْهٌ (S) or فُرَّهٌ. (K.) [See 4.]   </entryFree> <br>\
