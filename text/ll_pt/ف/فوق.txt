(Mgh, Msb, K) of place; (Mgh, Msb;) and a simple noun, indecl., [with dammeh for its termination, when the noun to which it should be prefixed is suppressed, and the meaning of this is intended to be understood, but not the word itself;] but when it is prefixed to another noun [which is either expressed or itself (and not merely its meaning) meant to be understood, and when the noun to which it should be prefixed is suppressed and neither this nor its meaning is meant to be understood,] it is declinable. (K. [For the words يَكُونُ اْسْمًا وَظَرْفًا مَبْنِىٌّ, the reading of the K in the TA and CK, my MS. copy of the K (which I follow in this case) has يكون ظرفا واسما مبنيّا.]) One says, زَيْدٌ فَوْقَ السَّطْحِ [<i>Zeyd is above,</i> or rather <i>upon, the house-top</i>].

                  <i>It floated upon the water.</i> (S &amp;amp;c. in art. طفو.) Ks has mentioned the saying, اَفَوْقَ تَنَامُ اَمْ اَسْفَلَ [<i>Dost thou,</i> or <i>wilt thou, sleep in the part that is above</i> of the house &amp;amp;c., <i>or in the part that is below?</i> i. e., <i>in the upper part,</i> or <i>in the lower part?</i>] with fet-h, as suppressing the noun to which فوق is [meant to be understood as] prefixed. (TA.) Lth says that he who uses it as a صِفَة [by which (like other old writers) he means an adv. n. of place] should use the accus. case, as when one says, عَبْدُ اْللّٰهِ فَوْقَ <br>\
                  زَيْدٍ [<i>&#39;Abd-Allah is above Zeyd</i>]: but if you make it simply a noun, you use the nom. case, and say, فَوْقُهُ رَاْسُهُ [<i>His superior</i> (meaning <i>upper</i>) <i>part is his head</i>]; for in this instance it is the head itself, and you make each to be governed in the nom. case by the other. (TA.) In the saying in the Kur [xvi. 28], فَخَرَّ عَلَيْهِمُ اْلسَّقْفُ مِنْ فَوْقِهِمْ [<i>And the roof fell on them from above them</i>], the utility of the phrase من فوقهم is hardly apparent,  because عليهم sometimes serves in its stead: but IJ says that من فوقهم may here have a useful office; for عَلَى is sometimes used in relation to deeds [or events] that are difficult, and deemed onerous; [for instance,] you say, قَدْ سِرْنَا عَشْرًا <br>\
                  وَبَقِيَتْ عَلَيْنَا لَيْلَتَانِ [<i>We have journeyed ten</i> nights <i>and</i> the journeys <i>two nights have remained</i> as though incumbent <i>on us</i>]; &amp;amp;c.; so that if it were said فخرّ عليهم السقف without the adding من فوقهم, it might be supposed to be like the saying عَلَيْهِمْ دَارُهُمْ قَدْ خَرِبَتْ [<i>Their abode had become in a state of ruin</i> as a punishment <i>upon them</i>]; but when He [referring to God] says من <br>\
                  فوقهم, that meaning which was supposable ceases to be so; and the meaning becomes this, that it [the roof] fell when they were beneath it. (TA.) اـِذْ جَاوُوكُمْ مِنْ فَوْقِكُمْ وَمِنْ اَسْفَلَ مِنْكُمْ [<i>When they came to you from above you and from below you</i>], in the Kur [xxxiii. 10], relates to Benoo- Kureydhah, who came to them from above them; and to Kureysh and Ghatafán, who came from the district of Mekkeh, from below them. (TA.) وَاْلَّذِينَ اْتَّقُوا فَوْقَهُمْ يَوْمَ اْلْقِيَامَةِ, in the Kur [ii. 208], means (assumed tropical:)  [<i>But those who have been careful of their religious duties</i>] <i>shall be above them in station</i> [<i>on the day of resurrection</i>]. (O.) And one says, [agreeably with what has been stated in the first sentence of this paragraph, اَخَذَهُ مِنْ فَوْقُ, and اَخَذَهُ مِنْ فَوْقٍ, [meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>He overcame him,</i> or <i>overpowered him,</i> and in like manner اَتَاهُ من <br>\
