                  رِبَابَة], <i>in the game called</i> <br>\
                  المَيْسِر: and (tropical:)  <i>it</i> (an arrow) <i>won;</i> or <i>came forth before its fellow</i> [<i>or fellows in that game</i>]. (O, * TA.) You say, فَازَ بِهِ <br>\
                  <i>He attained it, acquired it, gained it,</i> or <i>won it;</i> (Kh, A, O, Msb, K;) namely, good, or good fortune; (Kh, O;) or reward: (A:) and <i>he took it away, went away with it.</i> (S, K.) ―         -b2-  <i>He became safe,</i> or <i>secure; he escaped.</i> (S, A, O, Msb, K.) You say, فَازَ مِنهُ <br>\
                  <i>He became safe,</i> or <i>secure, from it; he escaped it;</i> (A, O, K;) namely, evil; (TA;) or punishment. (A, O, TA.) And طُوبَى لِمَنْ فَازَ بِالثَّوَابِ وَفَازَ مِنَ العِقَابِ <br>\

      فَوَّزٌ: (S, A, O, Msb, K:) thus the former bears two contr. significations: (A, K:) but IB says that, accord. to some, the latter is not used in this sense unless preceded by another phrase such as in the following ex.: فُلَانٌ بَعْدَهُ ↓ <br>\
      مَاتَ فُلَانٌ وَفَوَّزَ [<i>Such a one died and such a one died after him</i>]: and accord. to others, ↓ <br>\

<b>مَفَازَةٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     مَفَازَةٌ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>A place of safety, security,</i> or <i>escape.</i> (S, A, O, K.) So in the Kur [iii. 185], فَلَا تَحْسِبَنَّهُمْ <br>\
                  بِمَفَازَةٍ مِنَ العَذَابِ [<i>Do thou by no means reckon them</i> to be <i>in a place of security from punishment</i>]: (S, A, * O:) or, accord. to Fr, the meaning here is, <i>far from punishment.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  <i>A cause,</i> or <i>means, of prosperity,</i> or <i>success,</i> or <i>of the attainment or acquisition of that which one desires or seeks,</i> or <i>of what is good,</i> or <i>of that whereby one becomes in a happy or good state;</i> syn. مَفْلَحَةٌ. (A.) ―         -b3-  (tropical:)  [The <i>state of temporary safety which is between the present life and that which is to come.</i> See 1, last signification.]       -A2-  (tropical:)  <i>A place of perdition,</i> or <i>destruction:</i> (Msb, K: *) or <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  فَلَاةٌ: (A:) [i. e.] <i>a desert;</i> syn. بَرِّيَّةٌ; <i>any</i> [<i>desert such as is called</i>] قَفْرٌ: (TA:) or <i>a desert in which is no water:</i> (ISh, O, K:) and <i>a desert in which is no water for the space of a journey of two nights or more:</i> when there is none for the space of a journey of a night and a day, it is not thus called. (ISh, O, TA:) or <i>a tract in which two wateringplaces are so far apart that camels are kept from drinking two days, with a portion of the day preceding them and of the day following them,</i> [accord. to that which is generally preferred of the explanations of the term رِبْعٌ which is here employed,] <i>and other animals</i> [that journey quicker] <i>drink on alternate days;</i> as also فَلَاةٌ: or <i>such as is between that in which camels are kept from drinking two days &amp;amp;c. as above, and that in which other animals drink on alternate days;</i> as also فَيْفَاةٌ: (TA:) so called to prognosticate good fortune, and safety. (As, IF, S, A, O, Msb,) as meaning a place of safety, (A,) from فَازَ signifying “ he became safe: ” (Msb:) or from فَوَّزَ, (IAar, S, O, * Msb,) or فَازَ. (AHei, TA.) signifying “ he perished, ” (IAar, S, O, * AHei,) or “ he died: ” (Msb, TA:) AHei condemns the former of these assertions; but Az and ISd say that it is the more commonly approved, though the latter is the more agreeable with analogy: (TA:) or it is so called because he who comes forth from it, having traversed it, is safe: (IAar, TA:) the pl. is مَفَاوِزُ: (S:) and ↓ <br>\
      مَفَازٌ signifies the same as مَفَازَةٌ. so in a trad. of Kaab Ibn-Málik; فَاْسْتَقْبَلَ سَفَرًا بَعِيدًا وَمَفَازًا [<i>And he saw before him,</i> or <i>looked forward to, a far journey and a desert,</i> or <i>a waterless desert,</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (TA.)   </entryFree> <br>\
