                  , aor. يَفِيظُ, inf. n. فَيْظٌ (ISk, T, S, M, K) and فُيُوظٌ and فَيَظَانٌ (S, M, K) and فَيْظَانٌ (Lh, TA) and فَيْظُوظَةٌ, (Lth, M, K,) <i>He</i> (a man, S) <i>died;</i> (ISk, T, S, M, K;) as also, (sometimes, S) ↓ <br>\
      فَاظَ, aor. يَفُوظُ, inf. n. فَوْظٌ (ISk, T, S, M, K) and فَوَاظٌ; (S, K, TA; but in the CK, فُوَاظٌ, and there said to be with damm;) or, accord. to IJ, only the inf. n., فَوْظٌ, of the latter verb is used, though the verb itself is allowable on the ground of analogy. (M.) You say also, حَانَ فَيْظُهُ and ↓ <br>\
      فَوْظُهُ, [in the CK فُوْظُهُ,] <i>The time came for his dying.</i> (M, K.) In like manner, (S,) you say also, فَاظَتْ نَفْسُهُ <br>\
                  <i>His soul departed,</i> or <i>went forth;</i> Lth, T, S, M;) on the authority of AO and Ks; and the like is related on the authority of AZ; (S;) aor. تَفِيظُ, (M,) inf. n. فَيْظٌ (Lth, T, M) and فَيْظُوظَةٌ; (Lth, T;) and [accord. to some,] فَاظَتْ <br>\
                  نَفْسُهُ, inf. n. فَوْظٌ: (M:) or, when the نفس is mentioned, you say, فَاضَتْ, with ض: (K:) As says, I heard Aboo-&#39;Amr Ibn-El-&#39;Alà say that one should not say فَاظَتْ نَفْسُهُ, (T, * S, M, *) but فاظ, (S, M,) meaning “ he died; ” and not فَاضَ, with ض, decidedly; (S;) or not فَاضَتْ: (T:) [but what was said by As respecting these two verbs has been stated more fully, and variously, in art. فيض, q. v.:] AO says that فاظت نَفْسُهُ is of the dial. of Keys; and فاضت, of the dial. of Temeem: Fr says that the people of El-Hijáz and Teiyi say the former; and Kudá&#39;ah and Temeem and Keys say the latter: AHát says, I heard AZ say that Benoo-Dabbeh alone say the latter; and ElMázinee relates the like on the authority of AZ.  (TA.) ―         -b2-  You say also, فَاظَ نَفْسَهُ, (Ks, S, M, K,) aor. يَفِيظُ, (Ks, T,) <i>He vomited forth his soul:</i> (Ks, S, M, K:) the verb being trans. as well as intrans. (Ks, S.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>افاظهُ</b>               1     <br>\
                     افاظهُ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>He</i> (God) <i>caused him to die.</i> (K, TA.) And you say also, ضَرَبْتُهُ حَتَّى اَفَظْتُ نَفْسَهُ [<i>I beat him,</i> or <i>smote him, until I made his soul to depart,</i> or <i>go forth</i>]. (S.) And لَاُفِيظَنَّ نَفْسَكَ [<i>I will assuredly cause thy soul to depart,</i> or <i>go forth</i>] (M.) And افاظهُ اْللّٰهُ نَفْسَهُ [<i>God caused him to vomit forth his soul</i>].

<b>تفيّظوا اَنْفُسَهُمْ</b>               1     <br>\
                     تفيّظوا اَنْفُسَهُمْ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>They constrained themselves to vomit forth their souls.</i> (S, TA.) [But in one copy of the S, I find يُفِيظُوا اَنْفُسَهُمْ, expl. as meaning <i>They cause to vomit forth their souls;</i> which suggests that the right reading may perhaps be يُفِيظُوا: or it may be يَفِيظُوا, from فَاظَ نَفْسَهُ.]   </entryFree> <br>\
