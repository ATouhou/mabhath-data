      فُلُكٌ also, with two dammehs; and it is held that this may be the original form; and that فُلْكٌ may be a contraction, like as عُنْقٌ is [of غُنُقٌ accord. to Sb]: (MF, TA:) it is masc. and fem., (S, O, K, *) and sing. and pl., (S, O, K,) and Ibn-&#39;Abbád says that it has فُلُوكٌ also for a pl.: (O:) [it is said that] it may be sing., and in this case masc.; and pl., and in this case fem.: (IB, Msb:) [but see what here follows:] it occurs in the Kur-án in the following (and other) places: in xxvi. 119, &amp;amp;c.; where it is sing. and masc.: (S, O, TA:) and in [xvi. 14 and] xxxv. 13; where it is pl. [and fem.]: (TA:) and in ii. 159; where it is fem., and may be either pl. or sing.: it seems that, when it is sing., it is regarded as meaning the مَرْكَب, and is therefore made masc.; or the سَفِينَة, and is therefore made fem.: (S, O, TA:) or, (K,) as Sb used to say, (S, O, TA,) the فُلْك that is a pl. [in meaning] is a broken pl. of that, (S, O, K, TA,) i. e. of the فُلْك, (IB, O, K, TA,) that is a sing. [in meaning]: and it is not like الجُنُبُ, which is sing. and pl. [in meaning], and the like thereof (S, O, K, TA) among substs., such as الطِّفْلُ &amp;amp;c.; (S, O, TA;) for فُلْكَانِ has been heard from the Arabs as dual of فُلْكٌ, but not جُنُبَانِ [or the like] as dual of جُنُبٌ [or the like]; and they say that what has not been dualized is not a pl. [form], but [is, or may be,] a homonym, and what has been dualized [is, or may be,] a pl. [form]: (MF, TA:) Sb then says in continuation, (TA,) for فُعْلٌ and فَعَلٌ share in application to one thing [or meaning], as العُرْبُ and العَرَبُ, (S, O, K, TA,) &amp;amp;c.; (S, O, TA;) and as it is allowable for فَعَلٌ to have for its pl. فُعْلٌ, as in the instance of اَسَدٌ and اُسْدٌ, so too فُعْلٌ may have for its pl. فُعْلٌ. (S, O, K, TA.) ↓ <br>\
      فُلْكِىٌّ is a dial. var. of فُلْكٌ; and Abu-d-Dardà read, [in the Kur x. 23,] كُنْتُمْ فِى اْلْفُلْكِىِّ [<i>When ye are in the ships;</i> where others read فى الفُلْكِ; and where the context shows that the pl. meaning is intended].
