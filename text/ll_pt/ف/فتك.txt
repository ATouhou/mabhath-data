      افتك is a dial. var. thereof: (Msb:) <i>he seized an opportunity that he</i> (another) <i>offered him</i> (K, TA) <i>by his inadvertence,</i> (TA,) <i>and slew him:</i> or <i>he wounded him openly:</i> (K, TA:) or it has a more general meaning with respect to both of these acts: (K, * TA:) Fr says that الفَتْكُ signifies <i>the</i> man&#39;s <i>slaying openly.</i> (TA.) It is said in a trad., قَيَّدَ الاـِيمَانُ الفَتْكَ لَا يَفْتُِكُ مُوْمِنٌ [i. e. <i>The giving assurance of safety has inhibited</i> (or, emphatically, <i>inhibits</i>) <i>the slaying at unawares,</i> &amp;amp;c.: <i>one who gives assurance of safety shall not slay at unawares,</i> &amp;amp;c.: the like has been said above: see also an explanation of the former clause of the trad. in art. قيد].

      افتك: (K:) the latter verb is said by Fr to be a dial. var. of the former.
