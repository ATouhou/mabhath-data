                  طَا=ءٌ [and طَا]; the ا of which is reduced to ى [as its radical letter]: when you spell it, you make its final letter quiescent; but when you apply an epithet to it, and make it a noun, you decline it as a noun, saying, [for instance,] هٰذِهِ طَا=ءٌ طَوِيلَةٌ [<i>This is a tall</i> <br>\
                  ط]: it is one of the letters termed مَجْهُورَة [or vocal, i. e. pronounced with the voice, and not with the breath only]; and of the letters termed نِطْعِيَّة, like ت and د, because originating from the نِطْع [q. v.] of the roof of the mouth. (TA.) It is substituted for the ت in the measure اِفْتَعَلَ and the forms inflected therefrom, and [sometimes] for the pronominal ت, when immediately following any of the palatal letters [ص and ض and ط and ظ]; (MF, TA;) as in [اِصْطَبَرَ and اِضْطَرَبَ and اِطَّبَعَ and اِظْطَلَمَ, for اِصْتَبَرَ and اِضْتَرَبَ and اـِطْتَبَعَ and اِظْتَلَمَ; and in] فَحَصْطُ and حِضْطُ and خَبَطُّ and حَفِظْطُ, for فَحَصْتُ and حِضْتُ and خَبَطْتُ and حَفِظْتُ; but some of the grammarians say that this [latter] substitution is not to be made invariably; [nor is it common;] and it is said to be a dialectal peculiarity of some of the Benoo-Temeem. (TA.) It is also substituted for د: thus Yaakoob mentions, on the authority of As, مَطَّ الحُرُوفَ, for مَدَّ الحُرُوفَ: and AO, المَبْطَاُ, for المَبْدَاُ: and Aboo-&#39;Amr Ez-Záhid, in the Yawákeet, مَا اَبْعَدَ <br>\
                  طَارَكَ, for مَا اَبْعَدَ دَارَكَ. (TA.)       -A2-  [As a numeral, it denotes <i>Nine.</i>]   </entryFree> <br>\
