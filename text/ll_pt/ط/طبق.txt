      طَبْقًا, meaning <i>The sheep,</i> or <i>goats, brought forth one after another:</i> (L:) El-Umawee says, when they do thus, one says, وَلَدَتْهَا الرُّجَيْلَا=ءِ and وَلَدَتْهَا طَبَقًا and ↓ <br>\
      طَبَقَةً [<i>They brought them forth</i> (i. e. their young ones) <i>one after another</i>]. (S, O.) ―         -b19-  [The pl.] الاَطْبَاقُ also signifies <i>Those who are remote, and those who are remotely connected:</i> so in a trad. respecting the signs of the resurrection, or of the time thereof; in which it is said, يُوْصَلُ الاَطْبَاقُ وَيُقْطَعُ الاَرْحَامُ [<i>Those who are remote, and those who are remotely related, shall be brought into close connection, and the ties of relationship shall be severed</i>].

                  طَبَقٍ is an appellation of <i>A female tortoise,</i> [app. because of the cover of her back,] <i>which,</i> (S, O, K,) <i>as the Arabs assert,</i> (S, O,) <i>lays ninety-nine eggs, all of them</i> [<i>eventually</i>] <i>tortoises, and lays one egg which discloses</i> (S, O, K) <i>a serpent</i> (K) [or <i>a serpent such as is termed</i>] <i>an</i> <br>\

                  طَبَقٍ.) Hence the phrase اـِحْدَى بَنَاتِ طَبَقٍ, meaning (tropical:)  <i>A calamity;</i> (S, O, TA;) as also بِنْتُ طَبَقٍ: (TA:) بَنَاتُ طَبَقٍ meaning <i>calamities</i> [like مُطْبِقَاتٌ]: as well as <i>tortoises:</i> and <i>serpents:</i> (K:) and اُمُّ طَبَقٍ [in like manner] means <i>calamity:</i> (TA in art. طرق:) or, accord. to EthTha&#39;álibee, طَبَقُ [thus, imperfectly decl., as written in the L,) signifies <i>a yellow serpent:</i> (L, TA:) and اُمُّ طَبَقٍ and بِنْتُ طَبَقٍ are said to signify <i>the serpent,</i> because of its coiling itself round: or بَنَاتُ طَبَقٍ is an appellation applied to <i>serpents</i> because of their winding themselves round (لاـِطْبَاقِهَا) upon him whom they bite; or, as some say, because the حَوَّا=ء [q. v.] confines them beneath the lids (اَطْبَاق) of the baskets (اَسْفَاط) covered with leather; or, as Z says, because they resemble the طَبَق [i. e. cover, or dish, or plate,] when they coil themselves round.
