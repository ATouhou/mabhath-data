      طِيبَى is a dial. var. of طُوبَى: (O:) Aboo-Hátim Sahl Ibn-Mohammad Es-Sijistánee relates that an Arab of the desert, reciting as a pupil to him, persisted in pronouncing طُيْبَى for طُوبَى: (TA:) it signifies حُسْنَى [as meaning <i>A good final,</i> or <i>ultimate, state</i> or <i>condition</i>]: and (some say, O, Msb) خَيْرٌ [meaning <i>good, good fortune,</i> and <i>the like</i>]: (O, Msb, K:) and خِيرَةٌ [meaning <i>God&#39;s blessing</i> or <i>favour,</i> &amp;amp;c.]; (K;) as some say: (TA:) or <i>eternal life:</i> (Zj, TA:) or <i>a pleasant life:</i> (Msb:) and (O, K) a <i>certain tree in Paradise;</i> (S, O, K;) thus the Prophet is related to have said; and MF says that it is a proper name thereof, not admitting the article ال, and the like is said in the M: (TA:) or it signifies <i>Paradise</i> in the Indian language; (O, K;) or, accord. to Sa&#39;eed Ibn-Jubeyr, in the Abyssinian language: (O:) as also ↓ <br>\
      طِيبَى. (K.) These different significations are assigned by different persons to this word in the phrase in the Kur [xiii. 28] طُوبَى لَهُمْ [which seems to be best rendered as an announcement, meaning <i>A good final state,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>shall be to them,</i> or <i>be their lot</i>]: (Msb, TA:) Sb holds that it is an invocation of good, or a prayer, [as though قُلْ i. e. “ say thou ” were understood before it,] and that طوبى is virtually in the nom. case, i. e. مَرْفُوع, as is shown by the words immediately following وَحُسْنُ مَا=بٍ: but Th, who makes طوبى to be an inf. n. like رُجْعَى, says that one reading is طُوبَى لَهُمْ وَحُسْنَ مَا=بٍ, like the phrase سَقْيًا لَهُ: MF, however, [supposing Th to have said طُوبًى, though I think it indubitable that he said طُوبَى, and only meant that it was used as virtually, not literally, with tenween,] observes that رُجْعًى, with tenween, is not known to have been transmitted from any one of the leading authorities on the Arabic language. (TA.) Katádeh says that طُوبَى لَهُمْ is a phrase of the Arabs; who say, طُوبَى لَكَ اـِنْ فَعَلْتَ كَذَا <br>\
                  وَكَذَا [<i>A good final state</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>be to thee,</i> or <i>be thy lot,</i> or <i>shall be to thee, if thou do such and such things</i>]: and it is said in a trad., طُوبَى لِلشَّاْمِ [<i>May good,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>betide Syria</i>]; in which case, طوبى is of the measure فُعْلَى from الطِّيبُ, and does not mean “ Paradise, ” nor “ the tree. ” (L, TA.) One says, طُوبَى لَكَ and طُوبَاكَ; (S, K;) but not طُوَبيْكَ: (Yaakoob, S, O: [in one of my copies of the S طُوبِيكَ:]) or طُوبَاكَ is a barbarism: (O, K:) it is disallowed by the T, and by most of the grammarians: but Akh says that it is used by some of the Arabs; and Ibn-El-Moatezz uses it in the following verse: <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        مَرَّتْ بِنَا سَحَرًا طَيْرٌ فَقُلْتُ لَهَا<br>\

                        طُوبَاكِ يَا لَيْتَنَا اـِيَّاكِ طُوبَاكِ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>A flock of birds passed by us a little before daybreak, and I said to them, Good betide you: would that we were you: good betide you</i>]: Esh-  Shiháb El-Khafájee says that ل is understood [before the ك] in طوباك; but MF has argued well against this assertion.
