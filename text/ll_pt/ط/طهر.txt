                  , inf. n. تَطَهُّرٌ, is sometimes changed into اِطَّهَّرَ, inf. n. اِطَّهُّرٌ, the ت being incorporated into the ط, and this requiring a conjunctive ا, (Sgh, K,) in order that the word may not begin with a quiescent letter: (Sgh:) and طَهُورٌ is also an inf. n. [or rather a quasi-inf. n.] (Sb, K) of تَطَهَّرَ, (Mgh, TA,) like as وَضُوْءٌ is [said to be] of تَوَضَّاَ. (TA.) The meaning is, [<i>He became cleansed,</i> or <i>purified:</i> or <i>he cleansed,</i> or <i>purified, himself:</i> and] <i>he washed himself.</i> (Mgh.) You say, تطهّر بِالمَا=ءِ [<i>He cleansed,</i> or <i>purified,</i> or <i>washed, himself with water</i>]: (S:) <i>he performed the ablution termed</i> <br>\

(TA.) In the Kur vii. 80 and xxvii. 57, the verb is used derisively. (TA.) You say also, تطهّرت, (Mgh, Msb, K,) and اِطَّهَّرَتْ, (Mgh,) meaning, <i>She cleansed,</i> or <i>purified, herself by washing, from</i> [<i>the pollution of</i>] <i>the menstrual discharge,</i> (Mgh, Msb, K,) <i>&amp;amp;c.</i>; (K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      طَهَرَتْ and طَهُرَتْ; (Msb, * K;) agreeably with what is said in the B, that طَهَرَ and طَهُرَ and اطّهّر and تطهّر have the same signification: (TA:) or تطهّرت and اطّهّرت have this signification; but the unaugmented verb has the signification first assigned to it, or “ her discharge of blood stopped: ” (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, IAar:) in the Kur ii. 222, some read حَتَّى يَطْهُرْنَ; and others, حَتَّى يَطَّهَّرْنَ: but the latter reading is the preferable, on account of the difference between the two forms of the verb, just mentioned: (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás:) or the law which allows not the touching a woman until she has performed the ablution mentioned above shows the two forms of the verb to be the same in signification. (TA.) ―         -b2-  Also (tropical:)  <i>He removed himself far from unclean things,</i> or <i>impurities.</i> (S, Mgh, K. *) ―         -b3-  (tropical:)  <i>He refrained from sin,</i> (K, TA,) <i>and from what was not good:</i> (TA:) <i>he removed himself far from low,</i> or <i>ignoble, habits:</i> and in this sense, accord. to some, it is used in the Kur vii. 80 and xxvii. 57. (TA.) And تطهّر مِنَ الاـِثْمِ (tropical:)  <i>He removed himself far from sin.</i> (A.)    </entryFree> <br>\
