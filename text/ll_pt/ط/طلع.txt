      اِطَّلَعَ signifies the same as طَلَعَهُ: (TA: [see also مُضْطَلِعٌ, in art. ضلع:]) accord. to ISk, one says, طَلِعْتُ الجَبَلَ, with kesr, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>I ascended upon the mountain;</i> (S, O;) but others  say, طَلَعْتُ, with fet-h. (O.) And (tropical:)  <i>He ascended the mountain:</i> (TA:) [or] طَلَعْتُ فِى <br>\
                  الجَبَلِ means (assumed tropical:)  <i>I ascended the mountain.</i> (Msb. [See also another explanation of this latter phrase in what follows.]) ―         -b5-  And طَلَعَ عَلَيْنَا, aor.      <br>\

      اِطَّلَعَ; (assumed tropical:)  <i>He</i> (a man) <i>came to us;</i> (K;) and <i>came upon us suddenly,</i> or <i>at unawares:</i> (TA:) and طَلَعَ عَنْهُمْ <br>\

                  <i>he came forth upon the people,</i> or <i>party:</i> and <i>he looked upon them:</i> (MA:) accord. to ISk, طَلَعْتُ عَلَى القَوْمِ means <i>I came to the people,</i> or <i>party:</i> and طَلَعْتُ عَنْهُمْ <br>\
                  <i>I became absent,</i> or <i>absented myself,</i> or <i>departed, from them:</i> (S, O:) and عَلَيْهِمْ ↓ <br>\
      اَطْلَعْتُ signifies the same as طَلَعْتُ: (O:) and طَلَعْتُ عَنْهُمْ has the same meaning [also] as طَلَعْتُ عَنْهُمْ expl. above, accord. to ISk; عَلَى being put in the place of عن: accord. to AZ [likewise], طَلَعْتُ عَلَى القَوْمِ, inf. n. طُلُوعٌ, means <i>I became absent from the people,</i> or <i>party, so that they did not see me:</i> and also <i>I advanced,</i> or <i>approached, towards them, so that they saw me:</i> thus having two contr. meanings: and accord. to Az, the Arabs said, طَلَعْتُ فِى الجَبَلِ, inf. n. طُلُوعٌ, as meaning <i>I retired,</i> or <i>went back, into the mountain, so that my companion did not see me:</i> [see another explanation of this phrase in what precedes:] and طَلَعْتُ عَنْ صَاحِبِى, inf. n. طُلُوعٌ, <i>I retired,</i> or <i>went back, from my companion:</i> and طَلَعْتُ <br>\
                  عَنْ صَاحِبِى [in which عَنْ seems to be evidently a mistranscription for عَلَى] <i>I advanced,</i> or <i>approached, towards my companion.</i> (TA.) [In all of these phrases, طَلَعَ and طَلَعْتُ may be correctly rendered <i>He,</i> and <i>I, came forth,</i> or <i>went forth.</i> And hence,] it is said in a prov., هٰذِهِ يَمِينٌ قَدْ طَلَعَتْ فِى المَخَارِمِ [expl. in art. خرم, voce مَخْرِمٌ]. (AZ, TA.) ―         -b6-  For another meaning of طَلَعَ followed by عَلَى, see اِطَّلَعَ [which is more common as having that meaning]. ―         -b7-  طَلَعَ is also <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  قَصَدَ: so in the phrase طَلَعَ بِلَادَهُ (tropical:)  [<i>He tended, repaired, betook himself,</i> or <i>went, to,</i> or <i>towards, his country</i>]: (K, TA:) and so in the saying, in a trad., هٰذَا بُسْرٌ قَدْ طَلَعَ <br>\
                  اليَمَنَ, (so in the O,) or هذا بُرٌّ, (so in the TA,) (tropical:)  [<i>These are ripening dates,</i> or <i>this is wheat, that have,</i> or <i>has, gone to,</i> or <i>towards, El-Yemen,</i>] meaning from Nejd. (TA.) ―         -b8-  And <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  بَلَغَ; as also ↓ <br>\

      اطّلع [<i>He reached,</i> or <i>arrived at, this land</i>]: (O, K:) and hence, (TA,) عَلَى الاَفْيِدَةِ ↓ <br>\
      اْلَّتِى تَطَّلِعُ, in the Kur [civ. 7], means (assumed tropical:)  <i>Whereof the pain shall reach the hearts:</i> (Fr, O, TA:) or <i>which shall rise above the hearts,</i> (O, TA,) [or <i>overwhelm them,</i>] <i>and burn them.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   (assumed tropical:)  [<i>A place to which one ascends:</i> or] <i>a place of ascent from a low spot to a place that overlooks.</i> (As, TA.) Hence, (TA,) it is said in a trad. (O, K) of the Prophet, (O,) مَانَزَلَ مِنَ <br>\
                  القُرْا=نِ ا=يَةٌ اـِلَّا لَهَا ظَهْرٌ وَبَطْنٌ وَلِكُلِّ حَرْفٍ حَدٌّ وَلِكُلِّ <br>\
                  حَدٍّ مُطَّلَعٌ i. e. (O, K) (assumed tropical:)  <i>Not a verse of the Kur-án has come down but it has an apparent and known</i> [or <i>exoteric</i>] <i>interpretation and an intrinsic</i> [or <i>esoteric</i>] <i>interpretation,</i> (TA voce ظَهْرٌ, where see more,) [<i>and every word has a scope, and every scope has</i>] <i>a place</i> [meaning <i>point</i>] <i>to which the knowledge thereof may ascend,</i> (O, K, TA,) or, as some say, <i>something that may be violated,</i> God not having forbidden a thing that should be held sacred without his knowing that some one would seek to elicit it. (TA.) ―         -b2-  And <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  مَاْتًى; (S, O, K, TA;) مُطَّلَعُ الاَمْرِ meaning مَاْتَاهُ; (S, O, TA;) as also الاَمْرِ ↓ <br>\
      مَطْلَعُ; (TA;) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  <i>The way,</i> or <i>manner, of attaining to the doing,</i> or <i>performing, of the affair.</i> (TA.) One says, مَالِهٰذَا الاَمْرِ مُطَّلَعٌ (assumed tropical:)  <i>There is no way,</i> or <i>manner, of attaining to the doing,</i> or <i>performing, of this affair.</i> (TA.) And اَيْنَ مُطَّلَعُ هٰذَا <br>\
                  الاَمْرِ i. e. مَاْتَاهُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Where is the way of attaining to the doing,</i> or <i>performing, of this affair?</i>]. (S, O, TA.) ―         -b3-  And (tropical:)  <i>An elevated place from which one looks towards a low place.</i> (S, O, Msb, K, TA.) To this is likened the scene of the events of the world to come, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) after death, i. e. the station of the day of resurrection, (TA,) in the saying of &#39;Omar, لَوْ اَنَّ مَا فِى <br>\
                  الاَرْضِ جَمِيعًا لَاَفْتَدَيْتُ بِهِ مِنْ هَوْلِ المُطَّلَعِ (tropical:)  [<i>If all that is in the world belonged to me, assuredly I would ransom myself therewith from the terror of the place whence one will look down</i> on the day of resurrection]: (S, * O, Msb, * K, * TA:) or المُطَّلَع means <i>that which is looked upon</i> of such hardships as the interrogation of [the angels] Munkar and Nekeer, and the pressure of the grave, and its solitude, and the like; and is [for المُطَّلَعِ عَلَيْهِ, or] originally an inf. n. in the sense of الاِطِّلَاع: or it may be a noun of time, and thus applied to the day of resurrection.

                   [pass. part. n. of 3, q. v.]. One says, الشر تلقى مُطَالَعَ الاِسْمِ, [thus in my original, app. الشَّرَّ تَلْقَى الخ,] meaning بَارِزًا مَكْشُوفًا [i. e., if I rightly read it, (assumed tropical:)  <i>Evil thou wilt find to be that whereof the name is manifest,</i> or <i>overt;</i> so that, when it is mentioned, it is well known].
