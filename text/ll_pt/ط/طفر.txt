                  , inf. n. اِطِّفَارٌ; (O, TA;) accord. to the K, اَطْفَرَ, inf. n. اـِطْفَارٌ, but the former is the right; (TA;) <i>He thrust his feet into the groins of his horse:</i> the doing of which is a fault in the rider. (O, K, TA.) And in like manner one says of a man when he makes his camel to run: (O, TA:) i. e. اِطَّفَرَ بَعِيرَهُ, inf. n. اِطِّفَارٌ, <i>He thrust his feet into the groins of his camel.</i> (L.) [It seems to be tropical, from what here follows.] ―         -b2-  اِطَّفَرَ الرَّجُلُ, meaning <i>He stuck his nails</i> [into a thing] is originally اِظَّفَرَ; (TA; [in which it is said to be tropical; but for this I see no reason;]) as also اِطَّفَرَهُ <br>\

(Mgh, Msb.) Hence طَفْرَةُ النِّظَامِ [app. meaning <i>An overleaping the right order,</i> or <i>method:</i> I have not found any explanation of it]. (A.)    </entryFree> <br>\
