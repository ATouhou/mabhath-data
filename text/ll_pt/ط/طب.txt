(ISk, TA. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab.

      مُتَطَبِّبٌ signifies [likewise <i>one who practises physic:</i> and <i>a professor of physic:</i> (see its verb:) or] <i>one who applies himself to the science of physic:</i> (S, K, TA:) or <i>one who applies himself to that science but does not know it well:</i> (Nh, TA:) it has been said that the طَبِيب is so called from the same epithet as signifying “ skilful, or expert; ” but this is not a valid assertion: (TA:) the pl. (of pauc., S) is اَطِبَّةٌ (S, K) and (of mult., S) اَطِبَّا=ءُ. (S, Msb, K.) ―         -b2-  The first of these words (طبيب) occurs in a trad. as meaning (tropical:)  <i>A judge;</i> being metonymically thus used, because the office of him who judges between litigants is like that of the طبيب who cures diseases of the body.

      طِبَابٌ, the <i>piece of skin that is put over the two edges of the skin, in these things, when it is laid flat and then sewed, without being doubled:</i> (TA:) accord. to AZ, when the [piece of] skin, in the lower parts of these things, is doubled, and then sewed, it is called عِرَاقٌ; and when it is laid flat and then sewed, without being doubled, it is called ↓ <br>\
      طِبَابٌ: (TA; and the like is said in the S in art. عرق:) or طِبَابَةٌ and عِرَاقٌ both signify, accord. to As, <i>a piece of skin with which the punctures of the seams are covered:</i> (S in art. عرق:) or a طِبَابَة is <i>a wide strip of skin, in which is the sewing:</i> and the pl.

      طُبَّةٌ, the <i>strip of skin that is in the lower part of the</i> <br>\
