      طُبَنٌ, (K,) or this last is pl. of طُبْنَةٌ, (S, TA,) <i>A certain game,</i> (S, K, TA,) [said to be] <i>played by children, by means of a circular line,</i> [<i>drawn on the ground,</i> (but see what follows,)] and [also] called by them الرَّحَى; (TA;) <i>called in Pers.</i> <br>\

                  دَرَهٌ, which is syn. with سِهْ بَرَهْ,] in a MS. copy of the K سَذْ مَرَهْ, and in the CK سِدْ مَزْه, [both app. mistranscriptions for سِهْ بَرَهْ,]) i. e. “ having three doors; ” (TA;) [app. the same that is sometimes called in Pers. سِهْ دَرَكْ;] the game that is called in Turkish طوقورجون [and طُوقُرْجِنْ], and in Arabic called also قرق; (TK;) [i. e. قِرْقٌ, which is said in the K and TA in art. قرق to be the <i>game called</i> <br>\
