      اُطْرُوشٌ, (Az, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) of which Az says, I know not whether it be Arabic or adventitious, (Msb,) and IDrd says that it is not genuine Arabic, (Mgh,) and AHát disallows it, but El-Ma&#39;arree says that it is Arabic, though the verb is a barbarism, (TA,) <i>Deaf;</i> (Msb, K;) and in some of the copies of [the work of] Yaakoob, ↓ <br>\
