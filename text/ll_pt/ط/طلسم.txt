                  <i>He</i> (a man) <i>made his face to be displeasing,</i> or <i>odious;</i> (M, L, TA;) <i>he contracted it;</i> or <i>made it austere,</i> or <i>morose:</i> and so طَرْمَسَ, and طَلْمَسَ, (L, TA,) and طَرْسَمَ. (TA in art. طلمس.) ―         -b2-  And <i>He</i> (a man) <i>bent down his head;</i> or <i>lowered his eyes, looking towards the ground;</i> or <i>was,</i> or <i>became, silent;</i> syn. اَطْرَقَ: and so طَرْسَمَ. (S in art. طرسم; and TA.) ―         -b3-  [And, accord. to Golius, <i>He receded,</i> or <i>drew back,</i> from fight; followed by عَنْ: (one of the significations assigned in the K to طَرْسَمَ:) he mentions this as on the authority of J: perhaps he found it in a copy of the S in art. طرمس (in which الطَّرْمَسَةُ is expl. as meaning الاِنْقِبَاضُ and النُّكُوصُ), or in some other art. of that work in which I do not remember to have seen it.       -A2-  Also <i>He sculptured, engraved,</i> or <i>inscribed,</i> a thing <i>with talismanic devices</i> or <i>characters.</i> And <i>He charmed,</i> or <i>guarded,</i> or <i>preserved, by means of a talisman.</i> See what follows.]    </entryFree> <br>\

                  , or, accord. to MF, طِلَّسْمٌ, [also written طَلِسْمٌ, and طِلِسْمٌ, and طِلِّسْمٌ, and طَلْسَمٌ, and طَلْسِمٌ, and طِلْسَمٌ,] said by MF to be a Pers., or foreign, word; [perhaps from a late usage of the Greek        <br>\
      <orth lang=&quot;gr&quot;>τέλεσμα</orth>;] but [SM says] in my opinion it is Arabic; a name for <i>A concealed secret;</i> [i. e. <i>a mystery:</i> hence our word <i>talisman:</i> accord. to common modern usage, it signifies <i>mystical devices</i> or <i>characters, astrological</i> or <i>of some other magical kind:</i> and <i>a seal, an image,</i> or <i>some other thing, upon which such devices,</i> or <i>characters, are engraved</i> or <i>inscribed; contrived for the purpose of preserving from enchantment</i> or <i>from a particular accident</i> or <i>from a variety of evils,</i> or <i>to protect a treasure with which it is deposited,</i> or (generally by its being rubbed) <i>to procure the presence and services of a Jinnee,</i> &amp;amp;c.:] pl. طَلَاسِمُ (TA) [and طِلَسْمَاتٌ or طِلَّسْمَاتٌ &amp;amp;c.].   </entryFree> <br>\
