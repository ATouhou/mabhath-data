                  خَتْمٌ, and <i>more particular than</i> <br>\
                  نَقْشٌ; as will be shown by what follows: accord. to Aboo-Is-hák the Grammarian, طَبْعٌ and خَتْمٌ both signify the <i>covering over</i> a thing, <i>and securing oneself from a thing&#39;s entering</i> it: and IAth says [in like manner] that they held طَبْعٌ to be <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  رَيْنٌ [inf. n. of رَانَ]: but Mujáhid says that رَيْنٌ denotes less than طَبْعٌ; and طَبْعٌ, less than اـِقْفَالٌ [or the “ closing with a lock: ” this he says with reference to a phrase in the Kur xlvii. 26]. (TA.) You say, طَبَعَ الكِتَابَ, (Mgh, Msb,) and طَبَعَ عَلَى <br>\

                  <i>He branded,</i> or <i>otherwise marked, the sheep,</i> or <i>goat.</i> (O.

(Er-Rághib, TA.) ―         -b2-  Also <i>He began to make,</i> or <i>manufacture,</i> a thing: and <i>he made</i> [a thing] as in instances here following. (Mgh.) You say, طَبَعَ مِنَ الطِّينِ <br>\

      طبّع, (S, O, K,) inf. n. تَطْبِيعٌ: (S, O:) because the quantity that fills it is a sign that prevents the taking a portion of what is in it [without the act&#39;s being discovered].
