      طَامَنَهُ, (TA, and so in some copies of the K,) without ء, for the ء in اِطْمَاَنَّ [q. v. infrà] is [said to be] for the purpose of preventing the combination of two quiescent letters, (TA,) or طَامَنَهُ also, the former being the original, (Msb,) <i>He</i> (a man, Msb) <i>bent down his back;</i> (Msb, TA;) <i>he lowered it;</i> (Msb;) and طَمْاَنَهُ signifies the same.

                     اِطْمَاَنَّ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                   is said by some to be originally [اِطْمَانَّ] like اِحْمَارَّ, (Msb,) as Esh-Shiháb states in the Expos. of the Shifè, (TA,) and to be pronounced with ء for the purpose of avoiding [the combination of] the two quiescent letters, (Msb, TA,) anomalously: (Msb:) and some say that it is originally اِطْاَمَنَّ, (Msb, TA,) because you say طَاْمَنَ الرَّجُلُ ظَهْرَهُ, with ء, (Msb,) or, as Suh says, in the R, because it is from تَطاْمَنَ, the م being put before the ء in order to render the word more easy of pronunciation, (TA,) therefore it is anomalous; (Msb;) Sb [likewise] held it to be formed by transposition, and derived from طَاْمَنَ; but AA held the contrary to be the case. (TA.) ―         -b2-  You say, اِطْمَاَنَّتِ الاَرْضُ, and ↓ <br>\
      تَطَامَنَت [or ↓ <br>\
      تَطَاْمَنَت], meaning <i>The land,</i> or <i>ground, was,</i> or <i>became, low,</i> or <i>depressed.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  See also Q. Q. 2. ―         -b4-  اطمانّ, (S, Mgh, K,) inf. n. اِطْمِيْنَانٌ and طُمَاْنِينَةٌ, (S, K,) or the latter is a simple subst., (Mgh, Msb,) signifies [also] <i>He</i> (a man, S) <i>was,</i> or <i>became, still, in a state of rest</i> or <i>ease, quiet,</i> or <i>calm;</i> syn. سَكَنَ; (S, Mgh;) as also اِطْبَاَنَّ, which is formed by permutation. (S.) And thus it signifies as said of the heart, i. e. <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, still, in a state of rest</i> or <i>ease, quiet, calm, tranquil, unruffled,</i> or <i>free from disquietude.</i> (Msb.) Thus too in the saying, اطمان اـِلَى كَذَا, i. e. (tropical:)  <i>He trusted to such a thing,</i> or <i>relied upon it, so as to become at rest</i> or <i>ease,</i> or <i>quiet, in mind.</i> (K, * TA.) And one says also, اطمانّ جَالِسًا [<i>He became still,</i> or <i>at rest,</i> or <i>at ease, sitting</i>]: (TA:) and اطمانّ بِنَا <br>\
                  الجُلُوسُ [lit. <i>The sitting became still,</i> or <i>free from disquiet, with us</i>]; meaning اِسْتَقْرَرْنَا وَسَكَنَّا فِى <br>\
                  الجُلُوسِ [i. e. <i>we became settled,</i> or <i>at rest</i> or <i>ease, and still, in the sitting;</i> or <i>became seated at ease</i>]. (Har p. 280.) And اطمانّ بِالمَوْضِعِ [<i>He settled in the place;</i> i. e.] <i>he remained, stayed, abode,</i> or <i>dwelt, in the place, and took it as his home.</i> (Msb.) And اطمانّ عَمَّا كَانَ يَفْعَلُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He became at rest from that which he was doing;</i>] i. e. <i>he desisted from that which he was doing.</i> (TA.) And ↓ <br>\
      فِيهِ تَطَامُنٌ [or ↓ <br>\
      تَطَاْمُنٌ] <i>In him is quietness, calmness,</i> or <i>sedateness.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   an [irreg.] inf. n. of اِطْمَاَنَّ, (S, K,) or a subst. therefrom; as such signifying [<i>A depression</i> in the ground; as, for instance, in the S and K voce رَزْنٌ: (comp. مُطْمَاَنٌّ:) ―         -b2-  and also] <i>Stillness, a state of rest</i> or <i>ease, quietness, calmness, tranquillity,</i> or <i>freedom from disquietude.</i> (Mgh, Msb.)    </entryFree> <br>\

      طَمْنٌ, (K,) but this is a word unused in the [genuine] language, (TA,) pl. طُمُونٌ. (K.)
