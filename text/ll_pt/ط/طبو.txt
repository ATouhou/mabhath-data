                  , (S, K,) aor. يَطْبُوهُ, (S,) inf. n. طَبْوٌ; (K;) and طَبَاهُ, aor. يَطْبِيهِ, (S, TA,) inf. n. طَبْىٌ; (TA in art. طبى;) <i>He called him:</i> (S, K:) or, accord. to Sh, <i>he called him with a gentle calling:</i> (TA:) an ex. of the latter verb occurs in a verse of Dhu-r-Rummeh cited voce ضَارِبٌ, (S,) or, as Lh cited that verse, an ex. of the former verb: (TA:) and ↓ <br>\
      اِطَّبَاهُ, (Sh, S, K, [in the CK erroneously written اَطْبَاهُ,]) of the measure اِفْتَعَلَهُ, (S,) signifies the same. (Sh, S, K.) And [hence] one says, لاَ اَدْرِى مِنْ اَيْنَ اطبيت, [a mistranscription for طُبِيتَ,] with damm, and اطّبيت, [i. e. ↓ <br>\
      اْطُّبِيتَ,] meaning [<i>I know not whence thou hast been called;</i> or] <i>whence thou hast come.</i> (TA in art. طبى.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   see 1, in two places. ―         -b2-  One says also اِطَّبَى بَنُو فُلَانٍ فُلَانًا, (S, K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously, اَطْبَى,]) <i>The sons of such a one associated as friends with such a one and slew him:</i> (S, K, TA:) and اِطَّبَيْتُهُ <br>\
                  <i>I acted with him as a friend, then I slew him.</i> (IKtt, TA.) ―         -b3-  اِطَّبَى القُلُوبَ, in a trad. of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr, means <i>He showed love,</i> or <i>affection, to the hearts</i> [of others], <i>and drew them near to him.</i> (TA.) And اِطَّبَاهُ signifies also <i>He attracted him to himself;</i> or <i>sought to make him incline.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   (thus written without any vowel-sign) is said in the TA, in art. طبى, to signify اَحْمَقُ (i. e. <i>Stupid,</i> &amp;amp;c.): but I think it probable that this is from a mistranscription for ظَبْاَةٌ, properly meaning “ a hyena; ” a beast proverbial for stupidity: see ضَبُعٌ.]    </entryFree> <br>\
