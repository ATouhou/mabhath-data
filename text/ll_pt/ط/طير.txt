      طِيَرَةٌ: for the Arabs used to augur evil from the croaking of the crow, and from birds going towards the left: [see 5:] (TA:) and ↓ <br>\
      طِيَرَةٌ is an inf. n. [or rather a quasi-inf. n.] of تَطَيَّرَ, [q. v.,] (IAth,) and signifies <i>auguration of evil.</i> (Msb.) The Arabs used to say, to a man or other thing from which they augured evil, (TA,) طَايِرُ اْللّٰهِ لَا طَايِرُكَ, (ISk,  S, IAmb,) and طايرَ اللّٰه لا طايرَك, meaning <i>What God doth and decreeth, not what thou dost and causest to be feared:</i> (IAmb:) accord. to ISk, one should not say اْللّٰهِ ↓ <br>\
      طَيْرُ: (S:) but the Arabs are related to have said, also, لَا طَيْرَ اـِلَّا طَيْرُ اْللّٰهِ [<i>There is no evil fortune but that which is of God</i>]; like as one says, لَا اَمْرَ اـِلَّا اَمْرُ اْللّٰهِ. (As, S.) They also used to say, جَرَى لَهُ الطَّايِرُ بِاَمْرِ كَذَا [<i>Fortune brought to him such an event</i>]: and hence fortune, whether good or evil, is called طاير. (TA.) And it is said in the Kur [vii. 128], اـِنَّمَا طَايِرُهُمْ عِنْدَ اْللّٰهِ, meaning <i>Their evil fortune,</i> which will overtake them, <i>is only</i> that which is threatened to befall them in the latter state, [<i>with God,</i>] and not that which befalls them in the present state of existence: (TA:) or <i>the cause of their good and evil is only with God;</i> i. e., it is his decree and will: or <i>the cause of their evil fortune is only with God;</i> i. e., it is their works, which are registered with Him. (Bd.) It is said in a trad., that Mohammad liked what is termed فَاْل, and disliked what is termed ↓ <br>\
      طِيَرَة: (S:) and in another, that he denied there being any such thing as the latter. (TA.)       -A2-  Also The <i>means of subsistence;</i> syn. رِزْقٌ. (K:) or <i>misery:</i> or <i>happiness:</i> every one of these three significations has been assigned to it in the Kur xvii. 14: in which, accord. to AM, it is meant that God has decreed to every man happiness or misery, according as He foresaw that he would be obedient or disobedient. (TA.) [See also what immediately follows.]       -A3-  Also The <i>actions of a man which are</i> [<i>as it were</i>] <i>attached as a necklace to his neck.</i> (S, Msb, K.) And this is [also said by some to be] its signification in the Kur xvii. 14. (Jel.) [The actions of a man are the cause of his happiness or misery.]       -A4-  الطَّايِرُ signifies also <i>The brain.</i> (AAF, L, K.)    </entryFree> <br>\
