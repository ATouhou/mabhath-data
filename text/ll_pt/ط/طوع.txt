      اَمَرَهُ فَاطَاعَهُ [<i>He commanded him and he obeyed him</i>], with ا, not otherwise; (S;) or اَمَرَهُ قَاَطَاعَ [<i>he commanded him and he obeyed</i>]; for it is said that ↓ <br>\
      الطَّاعَةُ is never otherwise than a consequence of a command; and IF says that when one goes by command of another you say of him اطاعهُ: (Msb:) Er-Rághib says that ↓ <br>\
