      استخفى: (see مُسْتَخْفٍ, below:)] or, accord. to some, the particle that connects it with its subject distinguishes one meaning from the other: (Msb:) you say, خَفِى <br>\
                  عَلَيْهِ, aor. and inf. n. as above, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) <i>it</i> (a thing, or an affair, Mgh) <i>was,</i> or <i>became, unperceived</i> or <i>imperceptible,</i> [&amp;amp;c., <i>by him;</i>] <i>unapparent,</i> or <i>not apparent,</i> [or <i>obscure,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>to him;</i>] (TA;) or <i>hidden,</i> or <i>concealed, from him:</i> (Mgh, Msb:) and خَفِىَ لَهُ <br>\

      الخَفَا=ءُ here signifies <i>the secret;</i> and the meaning is, <i>the secret became apparent:</i> (TA:) or, lit., <i>the low ground became high and apparent;</i> meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>what was concealed became revealed.</i> (Har pp. 133-4. [See also art. برح.]) [And عَلَى خَفَا=ءٍ means <i>Covertly, secretly, privately, stealthily,</i> or <i>clandestinely.</i> (See also what follows.)] ―         -b2-  خَفِيتُ لَهُ, aor.      <br>\

      اختفى in the sense of خَفِىَ is not of high authority, nor is it disallowed, (Az, Msb, TA,) but ↓ <br>\
      استخفى is more usual. (Az, TA.) You say, فَعَلْتُهُ خُفْيَةً and خِفْيَةً [<i>I did it covertly, secretly, privately, stealthily,</i> or <i>clandestinely</i>]. (Msb) And قُتِلَ خفْيَةً and خِفْوَةً [<i>He was slain covertly, secretly,</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (JK.) And يَاْكُلُهُ خِفْوَةً [lit. <i>He eats it covertly,</i> &amp;amp;c.,] means <i>he steals it.</i> (K.) In the saying in the Kur [vii. 53], اُدْعُو <br>\
                  رَبَّكُمْ تَضَرُّعًا وَخُفْيَةً, the meaning [of the last word] is, <i>Submissively, devoting yourselves to his service:</i> or, accord. to Zj, <i>adhering to his service in your minds:</i> or, accord. to Th, <i>celebrating Him in your minds:</i> or, accord. to Lh, <i>in quietness, and stillness:</i> (TA:) or <i>secretly;</i> and so in the similar passage in the Kur vi. 63. (Jel, and so Bd on this latter passage.) خُفْيَةٌ is from اَخْفَيْتُ الصَّوْتَ [explained below in this paragraph]: (JK:) the intrans. v. whereof is ↓ <br>\
      اختفى [signifying <i>It</i> (the voice) <i>was,</i> or <i>became, suppressed,</i> or <i>stifled;</i> or <i>low, faint, gentle,</i> or <i>soft;</i> like خَفِىَ, which is more common].

      اخفاهُ: (S, K:) or, accord. to some, this latter has the latter meaning; and the former verb has [only] the former meaning: but accord. to other, the reverse is the case: (Msb:) or, accord. to Aboo-&#39; Alee El-Kálee, the former verb has the former meaning only; and ↓ the latter verb has both meanings: (IB, TA:) ↓ the latter is also explained as signifying <i>he removed its</i> <br>\
                  خِفَا=ء, i. e. its <i>covering:</i> (TA:) and the former, as meaning <i>he made it to come forth from a state of concealment:</i> (JK:) and <i>he drew it forth;</i> (K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      اختفاهُ. (S, Msb, K.) One says, خَفَى المَطَرُ الفَاْرَ <br>\
                  <i>The rain made the rats,</i> or <i>mice, to come forth from their holes.</i> (S.) It is said in the Kur [xx. 15], اـِنَّ السَّاعَةَ ا=تِيَةٌ اَكَادُ <br>\
                  اَخْفِيهَا, (JK, TA,) or ↓ <br>\
      اُخْفِيهَا, (JK, S, TA,) accord. to different readers: (TA:) the former means [<i>Verily the hour of the resurrection is coming:</i>] <i>I am almost making it to appear:</i> (JK, TA:) and the latter, <i>I am almost removing that which conceals it:</i> (S, IJ, TA:) or <i>I almost conceal it:</i> (JK, TA:) or, as Ubeí reads it, اَكَادُ اُخْفِيهَا مِنْ نَفِْسى [<i>I almost conceal it from Myself</i>]: and Fr says [that the meaning is], <i>I almost conceal it from Myself,</i> and how then should I acquaint you therewith? (TA.) And it is said in a trad. respecting the flight [from Mekkeh], اخفى عَنَّا خَبَرَكَ [written without the vowel-signs, so that it may be اِخْفِى or ↓ <br>\
      اَخْفِى,] i. e. <i>Conceal thou thine information from such as may ask thee respecting us.</i> (TA.) And in another trad., كَانَ يَخْفِى صَوْتَهُ بِاَنِينٍ, thus with fet-h to the ى, meaning <i>He used to make his voice perceptible</i> [or <i>audible, with moaning</i>]. (TA.) And you say, الصَّوْتَ ↓ <br>\
      اَخْفَيْتُ [meaning <i>I suppressed,</i> or <i>stifled, the voice;</i> or <i>made it low, faint, gentle,</i> or <i>soft</i>]. (Lth, JK, TA.) [And الكَلَامَ ↓ <br>\
