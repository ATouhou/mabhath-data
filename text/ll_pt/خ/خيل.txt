                     خالي<br>\
                   is syn. with ظَنَّ and تَوَهَّمَ: (TA:) you say, خَالَ الشَّىْءَ, (Msb, K,) first pers. خِلْتُ, (JK, S,) aor. يَخَالُ, (Msb, K,) first pers. اـِخَالُ and اَخَالُ, (JK, S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.,) the former irregular, (Msb,) but the more chaste of the two, (S,) and the more used, (Msb,) of the dial. of Teiyi, but commonly used by others also, (El-Marzookee, TA,) the latter of the dial. of Benoo-Asad, accord. to rule, (S, Msb,) but of weak authority, (K,) though some assert it to be the more chaste, (TA,) inf. n. خَيْلٌ (S, Msb, K) and خَيْلَةٌ and خِيلٌ (K) and خِيلَةٌ (S, K) and خَالٌ and خَيَلَانٌ, (K, TA, [the last accord. to the CK خَيَلَالٌ,]) or, as in the T [and JK], خِيلَانٌ, (TA,) and خَيْلُولَةٌ and مَخِيلَةٌ (S, K) and مَخَالَةٌ; (K;) and خَالَ <br>\
                  الشَّىْءَ, aor. يَخِيلُ, is a dial. var. thereof; (Msb;) meaning ظَنَّةُ [<i>He thought,</i> or <i>opined, the thing:</i> and sometimes (see I&#39; Ak p. 109) <i>he knew the thing:</i> but it seems to have originally signified توهّم الشىءَ, i. e. <i>he surmised,</i> or <i>fancied, the thing:</i> see خَالٌ, below]. (S, Msb, K.) This verb, being of the class of ظَنَّ, occurs with an inchoative and an enunciative; if commencing the phrase, governing them; but if in the middle or at the end, it may be made to govern or to have no government. (S.) You say, اـِخَالُ زَيْدًا اَخَاكَ [and, if you will, زَيْدٌ اـِخَالُ اَخُوكَ and زَيْدٌ اَخُوكَ <br>\
                  اـِخَالُ, <i>I think Zeyd is thy brother</i> and <i>Zeyd I think is thy brother</i> and <i>Zeyd is thy brother I think</i>]. (JK.) Hence the prov., مَنْ يَسْمَعْ يَخَلْ, (S, TA,) i. e. <i>He who hears</i> the things related of men and of their vices, or faults, <i>will think</i> evil of them: meaning that it is most safe to keep aloof from other men: or, accord. to some, it is said on the occasion of verifying an opinion. (TA.)       -A2-  See also 8.       -A3-  خال عَلَىالمَالِ, aor. يَخِيلُ: see خَالَ in art. خول.       -A4-  خال said of a horse, (JK, K, TA,) aor. يَخَالُ, (K,) inf. n. خَالٌ, (JK, K,) <i>He limped,</i> or <i>halted,</i> or <i>was slightly lame.</i> (JK, K. *)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>تَخْيِيلٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     تَخْيِيلٌ<br>\
                     تخييل<br>\
                   signifies The <i>imaging</i> a thing <i>in the mind,</i> or <i>fancying it;</i> the <i>forming an image,</i> or <i>a fancied image,</i> thereof <i>in the mind:</i> (TA:) [and ↓ <br>\
      تَخَيُّلٌ has the same, as well as a quasipass., signification.] You say, [↓ <br>\

                  لِى and] لِى ↓ <br>\
      فَتَخَيَّلَ ↓ <br>\
      تَخَيَّلْتُهُ [<i>I imaged it in the mind,</i> or <i>fancied it, and it became imaged in the mind to me,</i> or <i>an object of fancy to me</i>]; like as you say, [صَوَّرْتُهُ فَتَصَوَّرَ لِى and] تَصَوَّرْتُهُ فَتَصَوَّرَ لِى: (S:) for ↓ <br>\
      تَخَيُّلٌ [as inf. n. of a quasi-pass. verb] signifies a thing&#39;s <i>being imaged in the mind,</i> or <i>fancied:</i> (Er-Rághib, TA:) and الشَّىْءُ لَهُ ↓ <br>\
      تخيّل means تَشَبَّهَ. (K. [And the same is indicated in the Msb.]) You say also, خُيِّلَ لَهُ كَذَا [<i>Such a thing was imaged to him in the mind;</i> i. e. <i>such a thing seemed to him</i>]; from الوَهْمُ and الظَّنُّ: (Msb:) and خُيِّلَ اـِلَيْهِ اَنَّهُ كَذَا (S) <i>It was imaged to him</i> [<i>in the mind,</i> i. e. <i>it seemed to him,</i>] <i>that it was so;</i> syn. شُبِّهَ; (PS;) from التَّخْيِيلُ and الوَهْمُ: (S, TA:) and لَهُ اَنَّهُ كَذَا ↓ <br>\
      تَخَيَّلَ signifies [in like manner <i>it became imaged</i> &amp;amp;c.; i. e.] تَشَبَّهَ; as also ↓ <br>\
      تخايل: (S:) and so the first of these three verbs is used in the Kur xx. 69. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ يَمْضِى عَلَى مَا خَيَّلَتْ, (JK and S in explanation of the phrase فُلَانٌ يَمْضِى ↓ <br>\
      عَلَىالمُخَيَّلِ,) i. e. شَبَّهَتْ [<i>Such a one goes on, notwithstanding what</i> (<i>the mind,</i> or <i>the case,) may image</i> to him, or <i>what is fancied</i> by him, of danger of difficulty; النَّفْسُ, or الحَالُ, accord. to Z, (see Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 94,) being understood]; meaning, <i>notwithstanding peril,</i> or <i>risk; without any certain knowledge.</i> (S.) Whence the prov., <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        عَلَىمَا خُيِّلَتْ وَعْثُ القَصِيمِ<br>\
                  </quote> i. e. I will go on, <i>notwithstanding what the soft tracts abounding in sand in which the feet sink may be imagined to be:</i> [or the right reading is probably خَيَّلَتْ, i. e. <i>notwithstanding what the soft tracts</i> &amp;amp;c. <i>may image to the mind,</i> of danger or difficulty:] the ت in خيّلت relates to the word وعث, which is [regarded as] pl. of وَعْثَةٌ; and على is a connective of a suppressed verb, namely, اَمْضِى, with what follows it: the meaning is, I will assuredly venture upon the affair, notwithstanding its terribleness. (Meyd.) And اِفْعَلْ <br>\
                  ذٰلِكَ عَلَى مَا خَيَّلَتْ, i. e. عَلَى مَا شَبَّهَتْ [<i>Do thou that, notwithstanding what</i> (<i>the mind,</i> or <i>the case,</i> as explained above,) <i>may image</i> to thee, of danger or difficulty]; (JK;) meaning, <i>in any case.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] خيّل لِلنَّاقَةِ, and ↓ <br>\
      اَخْيَلَ, <i>He put a</i> <br>\
                  خَيَال [q. v.] <i>near the she-camel&#39;s young one, in order that the wolf might be scared away from him,</i> (JK, * S, K, *) <i>and not approach him.</i> (JK, S.) ―         -b3-  And خيّل فِيهِ الخَيْرَ <br>\

      تخيّلهُ (K, TA) and تخوّلهُ: (TA: [see also 4 in art. خول:]) or you say, عَلَيْهِ ↓ <br>\
      تَخَيَّلَتْ, (T, S, TA,) meaning <i>I knew him;</i> or <i>knew his internal,</i> or <i>real, state;</i> (تَخَبَّرْتُهُ, T,  TA;) or <i>I chose him;</i> (اِخْتَرْتُهُ, S, TA;) <i>and perceived,</i> or <i>discovered, in him an indication,</i> or <i>external sign, of good.</i> (T, S, TA.) ―         -b4-  And خيّل <br>\
                  عَلَيْهِ, (S, Msb, K,) inf.n. تَخْيِيلٌ (Msb, K) and ↓ <br>\

                  لَبَّسَ عَلَيْهِ [<i>he made</i> (<i>a thing,</i> or <i>case</i>) <i>dubious to him</i>]. (Msb.) ―         -b5-  And خيّلت عَلَيْنَا السَّمَا=ءُ <br>\
                  <i>The sky thundered and lightened</i> [<i>over us</i>], <i>and prepared to rain:</i> but when the rain has fallen, the term ↓ <br>\
      تَخَيُّلٌ [so in my two copies of the S, app. used as an inf. n. of the verb in this phrase, as in a case above, or perhaps a mistranscription for تَخْيِيلٌ, though it will be seen from what follows that خيّلت and تخيّلت are both said of the sky in the same sense,] is not used: (S:) or خيّلت <br>\
                  السَّمَا=ءُ signifies <i>the sky became clouded, but did not rain;</i> (JK, and Har p. 36;) as also ↓ <br>\

      اَخْيَلَت, (K,) <i>the sky prepared to rain,</i> (Msb, K, TA,) <i>and thundered and lightened, but did not yet rain:</i> (TA:) or, accord. to Az, ↓ <br>\
      اخالت <br>\
                  السَّمَا=ءُ signifies <i>the sky became clouded:</i> (Msb, TA:) and السَّمَا=ءُ ↓ <br>\
      تخيّلت <br>\

      اخالت and ↓ <br>\
      اَخْيَلَت and ↓ <br>\

                  <i>the cloud showed signs of rain, so that it was thought</i> [or <i>expected</i>] <i>to rain.</i> (Msb.)       -A2-  خيّل also signifies, (JK, TA,) or ↓ <br>\
      تخيّل, (Ham p. 39,) [or each of these,] <i>He</i> (a man) <i>was cowardly,</i> or <i>weak-hearted, on the occasion of fight,</i> (JK, TA, and Ham,) <i>and did not act,</i> or <i>proceed, firmly,</i> or <i>steadily.</i> (Ham.) And خيّل عَنِ القَوْمِ and ↓ <br>\
      اَخْيَلَ, [but the former only is explained in this sense in the TA,] <i>He held back from the people,</i> or <i>party, through cowardice:</i> (K, TA:) so says Az, on the authority of&#39; Arrám. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
