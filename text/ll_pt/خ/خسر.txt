                     خَسِرَ<br>\
                  ; (K;) but the latter is an unusual form [except in the sense of اَخْسَرَ]; (B, TA;) inf. n. خُسْرَانٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and خُسْرٌ (S, Msb, K) and خَسَارَةٌ (Msb, K) [which are the only forms assigned in the TA to the verb when used with reference to traffic] and خُسُرٌ and خَسْرٌ and خَسَرٌ and خَسَارٌ; (K;) <i>He lost,</i> or <i>suffered loss</i> or <i>diminution:</i> or <i>he was deceived, cheated, beguiled,</i> or <i>circumvented:</i> (K:) فِى البَيْعِ <br>\
                  <i>in selling;</i> (S;) or فِى بَيَعِهِ <br>\

                  <i>in his traffic:</i> (Msb, K: [see also 4:]) the former is the original signification: (TA:) <i>he suffered diminution of his capital; he lost part thereof:</i> (B, TA:) and <i>he lost his capital altogether.</i> (Bd in iv. 118; &amp;amp;c.) خُسْرَانٌ is also attributed to an action, as well as to a man: (B, TA:) you say, (but in this case the verb is used tropically, A,) خَسِرَتْ تِجَارَتُهُ (tropical:)  [<i>His traffic was losing;</i> or <i>an occasion of loss</i>]; (A, B;) opposed  to رَبِحَتْ. (A.) It is also used in relation to personal acquisitions; such as health, and safety, and intellect, and faith, and the recompense or reward of obedience [to God], which God has declared [Kur xxii. 11 and xxxix. 17] to be manifest خُسْرَان, (B,) since there is none like it. (Bd.) For instance, you say, خَسِرَ عَقْلَهُ, and مَالَهُ, <i>He lost his intellect,</i> and <i>his property.</i> (IAar.) [In a phrase of this kind, the noun which immediately follows the verb may be considered as put in the accus. case on account of the rejection of a prep., namely فِى: for] it is said that خَسِرَ is never used otherwise than intransitively: though this has been contradicted, on the ground of the following phrase in the Kur [xxii. 11], خَسِرَ اْلدُّنْيَا <br>\
                  وَ اْلْا=خِرَةَ [<i>He hath lost,</i> or <i>he loseth, the things of the present life and of the latter life</i>]; and the like; as اْلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا اَنْفُسَهُمْ وَ اَهْلِيهِمْ [<i>Who shall have lost themselves,</i> or <i>their own souls, and their families,</i> or <i>their wives;</i> Kur xxxix. 17 and xlii. 44]; (MF, TA;) i. e., themselves, or their own souls, by their having erred, and their families by their having caused them to err, or by being separated from them for ever; (Bd;) or by being themselves made to remain for ever in Hell, and by their not gaining access to the حُور prepared in Paradise [as wives] for the believers: (Jel:) or the meaning is, accord. to Fr, <i>who shall be deceived of their own souls, &amp;amp;c.:</i> or, accord. to others, <i>who shall have destroyed their own souls, &amp;amp;c.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  Also [<i>He experienced,</i> or <i>saw, that he was loser;</i> or] <i>his having lost became manifest to him:</i> so in the Kur xl.
