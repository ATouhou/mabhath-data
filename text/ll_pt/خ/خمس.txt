                   The <i>drinking of camels on the fifth day, counting the day of the next preceding drinking as the first; their drinking one day, then pasturing three days, then coming to the water on the fifth day, the first and last days, on which they drink, being thus reckoned</i>: this is the correct explanation, accord. to Aboo-Sahl El-Khowlee; and Aboo-Zekereeyà says the like; (TA;) or <i>their pasturing three days, and coming to the water on the fourth day</i> [<i>not counting the day of the next preceding watering;</i> for it is evident that this explanation is virtually the same as that preceding]: (S, K:) accord. to Lth, the <i>drinking of camels on the fourth day, counting the day on which they returned from</i> [<i>the next preceding</i>] <i>watering;</i> but Az says, that this is a mistake; the day of returning from watering not being counted [when it is explained as meaning the drinking on the fourth day]: (TA:) pl. اَخْمَاسٌ, the only pl. form. (Sb, TA.) [See ظِمْءٌ.] Hence, فَلَاةٌ خِمْسٌ [as in copies of the K, or it may be فَلَاةُ خِمْسٍ,] <i>A desert in which the water is far distant, so that the camels come to the water on the fourth day, exclusive of the</i> [<i>next preceding</i>] <i>day on which they drank.</i> (Az, K, TA.) Hence also the saying, فُلَانٌ يَضْرِبُ اَخْمَاسًا لِاَسْدَاسٍ (S, K *) (tropical:)  <i>Such a one makes a pretence of</i> <br>\
                  اخماس [or <i>fifth-day waterings</i>] <i>for the purpose of</i> <br>\
                  اسداس [or <i>sixth-day waterings</i>]: i. e., he advances his camels from the خِمْس to the سِدْس: (K:) a prov.: (TA:) meaning, <i>such a one strives to deceive,</i> or <i>circumvent</i>: (S, K:) applied to him who acts towards another with artifice, pretending that he obeys him, or complies with his desire: (TA:) or to him who pretends one thing while he means another: (K:) and taken from the saying, related by AO and IAar, ضَرَبَ اَخْمَاسًا لِاَسْدَاسٍ [<i>He made a pretence of</i> <br>\
                  اخماس <br>\
                  <i>for the purpose of</i> <br>\
                  اسداس]; said of him who proposes a thing whereby he means another thing, which he commences and by slow degrees accomplishes: (TA:) for a man, when he desires to make a long journey, accustoms his camels to drink خِمْسًا سِدْسًا [i. e. <i>on the fifth day</i> and then <i>on the sixth, in each case counting the day of the next preceding drinking as the first</i>]: (K, TA:) the origin of the saying, accord. to IAar, being this: an old man was among his camels, accompanied by his sons, men, who pastured them, and who had been long far distant from their families; and he told them one day to pasture their camels رِبْعًا [i. e. watering on the fourth day, counting the day of the next preceding watering as the first], which they did, proceeding in the way towards their families: then they proposed to do so خِمْسًا; and then, سِدْسًا: whereupon the old man, understanding what they meant, said, ye are doing nothing but making a pretence of اخماس for the purpose of اسداس: the object of your desire is not the pasturing of them, but it is only your families. (TA.) [See below, voce خُمُسٌ, a saying similar in words but different in meaning.] ―         -b2-  It is also used for سَيْرُ خِمْسٍ [<i>A journey in which the camels are watered only on the first and fifth days; a journey in which the second and third and fourth days are without water</i>]. (L in art. جلذ.) You say خِمسٌ بَصْبَاصٌ, [and صَبْصَابٌ,] and قَعْقَاعٌ, and حَثْحَاثٌ, [and حَصْحَاصٌ, &amp;amp;c.,] i. e. <i>A journey</i> [<i>in which the camels are watered only on the first and fifth days,</i>] <i>in the course of which, to the water, there is no flagging, by reason of its remoteness.</i> (TA.) El-&#39;Ajjáj uses the expression <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
