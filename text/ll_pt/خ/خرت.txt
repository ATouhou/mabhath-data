                  <i>We knew the land and its roads.</i> (Ks, S.) [Golius omits this; but mentions, as on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof, خَرِتَ, signifying <i>He was skilful,</i> or <i>expert, in showing the way.</i> What Ibn-Maaroof says, however, is that the inf. n. خَرَتٌ signifies the <i>being acquainted with a road;</i> and, <i>with a place.</i> See خِرِّيتُ.]    </entryFree> <br>\

                   The <i>perforation, bore,</i> or <i>hole,</i> (S, A, K,) of a needle; [i. e. its <i>eye;</i>] (S, A; [see also خُرْتَةٌ;] and of the ear, (S,) or in the ear, [but see خُرْتَةٌ,] &amp;amp;c.; (A, K;) and of the فَاْس, [i. e. hoe, or adz, or axe,] (S, A, TA,) meaning, of the handle thereof; (A, TA;) as also خُرَةٌ; (Fr, TA in art. خرو;) [see again خُرْتَةٌ;] and ↓ <br>\
      خَرْتٌ signifies the same: (A, K:) pl. [of pauc.] اَخْرَاتٌ (S, A) and [of mult.] خُرُوتٌ. (S.) You say اَضْيَقُ مِنْ خُرْتِ الاـِبْرَةِ [<i>Narrower than the eye of the needle</i>]. (A.) And مَضَايِقُ كَاَخْرَاتِ الاـِبَرِ [<i>Narrow passes like the eyes of needles</i>]. (A.) The خُرْت of a sandal is The <i>hole,</i> or <i>perforation, of the</i> <br>\
                  ذُوَابَة [q. v.], <i>into which the thong</i> [<i>called the</i> <br>\
                  شِرَاك] <i>enters.</i> (An anon. Arabic MS. in my possession.) ―         -b2-  Also The <i>rings at the heads</i> [or <i>extremities</i>] <i>of</i> [<i>camels&#39; plaited fore-girths of the kind called</i>] نُسُوع; and so [the pls.] خُرَتٌ (K) and اَخْرَاتٌ: (S, K:) and ↓ <br>\

                  نِسْعَة. (TA.) [Hence the phrase,] قَلِقَ خُرْتُ فُلَانٍ [lit. <i>The rings of the fore-girths of the camels of such a one became unsteady;</i> meaning] (tropical:)  <i>the state of such a one became disordered,</i> or <i>perverted.</i> (A, TA.) And similar to this are the phrases, رَادَ خُرْتُ القَوْمِ and رَادَتْ <br>\
                  اَخْرَاتُهُمْ, [in the TA زاد and زادت, but the comparison evidently shows that the verbs should be راد and رادت,] said of a people when they do not receive or entertain hospitably him who alights at their place of abode: so says IAar on the authority of Es-Saloolee. (TA.) ―         -b3-  See also خُرْتَةٌ. ―         -b4-  Also <i>A small rib, at,</i> or <i>near, the breast;</i> and so ↓ <br>\

                     خرتته<br>\
                  : see خُرْتٌ. ―         -b2-  Its pl. اَخْرَاتٌ, [also pl. of ↓ <br>\
      خُرْتٌ, (see خُبْنٌ,)] in the formation of which the ة of the sing. seems to have been considered as elided, also signifies The <i>loops</i> of a [leathern water-bag such as is called] مَزَادَة: it is said in the T that in the مزادة are its اخرات, the <i>loops between which is the</i> <br>\
                  قَصَبَة [commonly signifying <i>cane,</i> or <i>reed,</i> but here app. meaning the <i>mouth,</i> which has the form of a short cylinder, and is in the middle of the upper part of the مزادة, between the two loops, these being at the two upper corners], <i>whereby</i> [app. referring to the اخرات] <i>it is carried</i> [<i>and suspended on the side of a camel,</i> counterpoised by another مزادة on the other side of the camel]: and AM adds that one says [also] اَخْرَابُ المَزَادَةِ, sing. خُرْبَةٌ [q. v.]; and in like manner, خُرْبَةُ الاُذُنِ [“ the bore of the ear ” ]; with ب: and غُلَامٌ اَخْرَبُ الاُذُنَيْنِ [“ a boy having his ears pierced, or bored ”]: he says, also, that the خُرْتَة, with ت, is [the <i>hole</i>] in the iron of the فَاْس, and [the <i>eye</i>] of the needle; and the خُرْبَة, with ب, is in the skin: and AA says that خُرْتَةٌ signifies the <i>eye</i> of the [kind of needle called] شَغِيزَة, i. e. the مِسَلَّة: (TA:) and Lth says that it signifies <i>a round hole.</i> (TA in art. حرت.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>Two stars,</i> (K,) <i>of the stars of the Lion, two whips&#39; lengths apart,</i> [(see سَوْطٌ,) <i>in</i>] <i>the two shoulder-blades of the Lion,</i> (TA,) <i>also called</i> <br>\
                  زُبْرَةُ الاَسَدِ, (K,) [<i>composing the Eleventh Mansion of the Moon:</i> (see زُبْرَةٌ: and see also مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل:)] the word is mentioned here in the K, as though it were of the measure فَعَالَانِ; but accord. to Kr and others, it is dual of خَرَاةٌ, belonging to art. خرو, in which it is again mentioned in the K: (TA:) accord. to ISd, however, only the dual form is known, and the radical ت and the augmentative ت [by which latter is meant ة] are in the dual alike: (TA in art. خرو:) Zj asked Th respecting the خراتان, and he answered, IAar says that they are <i>two stars, of those of the Lion;</i> and Aboo-Nasr, the companion of As, says that they are <i>two stars in the</i> <br>\
                  زبرة <br>\
                  <i>of the Lion,</i> i. e. <i>in the middle thereof;</i> but in my opinion they are <i>two stars after</i> [i. e. <i>to the eastward of</i>] <i>the</i> <br>\
                  جَبْهَة <br>\
                  <i>and the</i> <br>\
                  قَلْب: Zj disapproved of this, and replied, I say that they are <i>two stars in that part of the breast which is the stabbing-place,</i> derived from خُرْتُ الاـِبْرَةِ, “ the eye of the needle: ” but Th rejoined, that this was an error, because the word is the dual of خَرَاةٌ; and he cited some verses in which a poet speaks of certain stars in the Lion, and, among them, of الخَرَاةُ.
