                  , (K,) inf. n. خِدَاجٌ, (S, K, *) or this is a simple subst.,  (Msb,) <i>She</i> (a camel, AZ, S, Msb, K, and any cloven-hoofed or solid-hoofed animal, AZ, Msb, TA, or sometimes another female, TA) <i>cast her young one before the completion of the days of gestation,</i> (AZ, IKt, S, Msb, K,) to which IKoot adds, (Msb,) <i>even if it were completely formed;</i> (S, Msb;) as also خَدَجَتْ وَلَدَهَا; (IKtt, Msb;) and ↓ <br>\
      خدّجت, inf. n. تَخْدِيجٌ: (TA:) or, as some say, <i>she cast her young one when her pregnancy had become apparent, between the commencement of its formation and the period a little before the completion;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      اخدجت <br>\
                  وَلَدَهَا; but see the latter verb below: (Msb:) or <i>she</i> (a camel) <i>cast her young one in a defective state, before the time:</i> or <i>without any hair upon it:</i> or <i>miscarried, bringing forth merely blood:</i> and Thábit mentions the last but one of these significations as relating to a human being: (TA:) or you say of a woman, خَدَجَتْ وَلَدَهَا and ↓ <br>\
      اَخْدَجَتْهُ in one and the same sense, (Aboo-Kheyreh, TA,) meaning <i>she cast her fœtus in such a state that its form had become apparent:</i> and خَدَجَتْ <br>\
                  <i>she miscarried, bringing forth merely blood:</i> when she has brought it forth before its hair has grown, one says of her غَضَنَتْ: so says Az.

                  <i>She</i> (a camel) <i>brought forth her young one imperfectly formed,</i> (S, Mgh, K,) <i>even if the period of gestation were complete:</i> (S, K:) or so اخدجت وَلَدَهَا: and the former, <i>she brought forth her young one imperfectly formed at the completion of the period:</i> (IKt, Msb:) or <i>she brought forth her young one completely formed before the proper time of bringing forth.</i> (TA.) See also 1, in two places. ―         -b2-  Hence, (TA,) اخدجت الشَّتْوَةٌ, (IAar, S,) or الصَّيْفَةُ, (K,) (tropical:)  [<i>The winter,</i> or <i>the spring</i> or <i>summer</i> (but more probably the former),] <i>had little rain.</i> (IAar, S, K, TA.)
