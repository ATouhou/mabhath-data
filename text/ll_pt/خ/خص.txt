      خَاصَّةٌ as signifying <i>A particular, peculiar,</i> or <i>special, friend, intimate, familiar, companion, associate, attendant, dependent,</i> or <i>servant:</i>] the latter is explained in the T [and JK] as meaning <i>a person whom thou hast appropriated, particularly distinguished, taken,</i> or <i>chosen,</i> (اِخْتَصَصْتَهُ,) [<i>as a friend,</i> &amp;amp;c.,] <i>to,</i> or <i>for, thyself:</i> (TA:) [and it is used as a sing. and as a pl.: for] you say, هٰذَا خَاصَّتِى [<i>This is my particular,</i> or <i>special,</i> or <i>choice,</i> or <i>choicest, friend,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: and هُمْ خَاصَّتِى [<i>They are my particular,</i> or <i>peculiar,</i> or <i>special,</i> or <i>choice,</i> or <i>choicest, friends,</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (A.) You say also, فُلَانٌ خَاصٌّ لِفُلَانٍ, (Kull p. 174,) or بِفُلَانٍ, (so in the L,) [app. meaning لِفُلَانٍ, unless it be mistranscribed, and the latter be the correct reading, which I think much the more probable;] i. e., <i>Such a one belongs exclusively</i> [<i>as a particular,</i> or <i>peculiar,</i> or <i>special, friend,</i> &amp;amp;c.,] <i>to such a one;</i> (Kull;) and ↓ <br>\
      مُخَصٌّ signifies the same. (L.) ―         -b6-  See the dim. of خَاصَّةٌ, (namely خُوَيْصَّةٌ,) below.    </entryFree> <br>\

      خَاصِّيَّةٌ [thus correctly written, and thus I have always found it written except by Golius and those who have probably imitated him, who write it without the sheddeh to the ى,] is used as denoting [<i>a property,</i> or <i>particular</i> or <i>peculiar virtue, which is</i>] <i>an unknown cause of a known effect; as that by which a medicine operates:</i> the former differs from the latter in being conventionally applied to <i>an effect,</i> [or <i>effective property,</i>] <i>whether the cause of its existence be known or not:</i> [the pl. of the former is خَوَاصُّ, agreeably with analogy and usage, like as عَوَامُّ is pl. of عَامَّةٌ:] the pl. of the latter is خَاصِّيَّاتٌ [and خَصَايِصُ]; and خَوَاصُّ is a quasi-pl. n., not a pl., of the same.

      خاصّيّة, as here explained, are perhaps post-classical; but of this I am not certain: and both are sometimes used as meaning The <i>peculiar nature</i> of a thing; also termed its <i>essence.</i>]) ―         -b3-  خَاصَّةً and بِخَاصَّةٍ: see خُصُوصٌ.    </entryFree> <br>\

                   dim. of خَاصَّةٌ; (A, K;) [like دُوَيْبَّةٌ, q. v., dim. of دَابَّةٌ;] originally خُوَيْصِصَةٌ; (TA;) the ى being quiescent because the ى of the dim. cannot be movent; (A, K;) [properly signifying <i>A little,</i> or <i>young, particular,</i> or <i>peculiar,</i> or <i>special, friend, companion, associate, attendant,</i> or <i>servant;</i> and used in other senses, like other diminutives; implying littleness of estimation; and also affection, and awe.] It is said in a trad., (TA,) عَلَيْكَ بِخُوَيْصَّةِ نَفْسِكَ [<i>Keep thou to the little,</i> or <i>dear, particular friend of thine own self:</i> so it seems to mean accord. to Z, being mentioned by him among the proper expressions belonging to this art.: but accord. to the TK, it appears to be tropical; for the meaning is there said to be, (assumed tropical:)  <i>thine own particular state,</i> or <i>condition</i>]. (A, TA.) In another trad., خويصّة is used as signifying <i>A little, young, particular,</i> or <i>peculiar,</i> or <i>special, servant.</i> (TA.)
