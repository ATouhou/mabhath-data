                  , (S, O,) inf. n. خَضْخَضَةٌ, (S, O, K,) <i>He agitated it; moved it about; stirred it; shook it;</i> namely, water, (S, O, K,) and the like, (S, O,) and سَوِيق, and the like. (O, K.) You say also, خَضْخَضْتُ دَلْوِى فِى المَا=ءِ [<i>I agitated,</i> or <i>dashed about, my bucket in the water</i>]. (O, TA.) Sakhr-el-Gheí El-Hudhalee says, describing a water to which he had come for drink, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                        خِيَاضَ المُدَابِرِ قِدْحًا عَطُوفَا<br>\
                  </quote> (O, TA,) i. e. [<i>And I dashed about my leathern bucket in the main body thereof,</i>] <i>as he who is overcome in the game of el-meysir introduces among the other arrows a borrowed arrow</i> [<i>that comes forth winning</i>], in the luck of which he has confidence. (TA in art. خوض.) This verb, though mentioned here, is [said to be] from خَاضَ, aor. يَخُوضُ; not from خَضَّ; therefore the poet here uses خَيِاض for its inf. n. (O, TA.) You also say, جَا=ءَهُ بِالخَنْجَرِ فَخَضْخَضَ بِهِ بَطْنَهُ [<i>He came to him with the dagger, and stirred about with it his belly</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  [Hence a meaning of the inf. n. explained in the first paragraph of art. جلد.]    </entryFree> <br>\
