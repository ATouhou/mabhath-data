                  <i>Clouds in which is no water.</i> (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, K.) A cloud like these does not move from its place: only that which contains water travels along: that which sends forth a slightly-flashing lightning scarcely ever, or never, does so.

The weak believer is likened, in a trad., to خَافِتُ الزَّرْعِ, (A, TA,) which at one time inclines, and at another time stands straight; accord. to A &#39;Obeyd, خافت meaning what is <i>fresh,</i> or <i>juicy, and soft,</i> or <i>tender:</i> or, accord. to one reading, to خَافِتَةُ الزَّرْعِ, meaning <i>fresh,</i> or <i>juicy, seed-produce, that is soft,</i> or <i>tender, and weak;</i> the ة being added in خافته as though by زرع were meant سُنْبُلَة.
