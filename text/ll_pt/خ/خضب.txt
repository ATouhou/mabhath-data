      اَخْضَبَتْ, (TA,) for which اخصبت, with the unpointed ص, is said by Az to be a gross mistranscription; explained by Lth, on whose authority it is written with ص, [as also in the K in art. خصب,] as meaning <i>the sap flowed in the branches of the</i> <br>\

(TA.) It is also said to be applied as an epithet to Any animal <i>that eats</i> <br>\
