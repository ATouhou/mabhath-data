      انخضع, (K in art. خذا,)] and ↓ <br>\
      اِخْضَوْضَعَ: (Sgh, K:) خُضُوعٌ is <i>nearly the same as</i> <br>\
                  خُشُوعٌ, except that the latter is mostly used in relation to the voice [or the eyes]; but the former is used as meaning <i>in the necks:</i> (Msb:) or the former is <i>in the body,</i> (&#39;Eyn and K in art. خشع,) and signifies the acknowledgment of humility and submission; (&#39;Eyn;) and the latter is in the voice and in the eyes. (&#39;Eyn and K ubi suprà.) It is said in a trad. respecting the [devils&#39;] hearing [the words of the angels] by stealth, خُضْعَانًا لِقَوْلِهِ [<i>With submissiveness to his saying,</i> or <i>to what he said</i>]; or, accord. to one relation, خِضْعَانًا; but it may be a pl. of خَاضِعٌ; and accord. to another relation, it is خُضَّعًا, which is a pl. of خَاضِعٌ. (TA.) ―         -b2-  <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, still,</i> (K, TA,) <i>and tractable,</i> or <i>submissive.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  <i>He made his words soft</i> to a woman; as also ↓ <br>\
      اخضع: (L:) or the latter signifies <i>his speech was soft</i> to a woman. (O, K.) It is said in the Kur [xxxiii. 32], فَلَا تَخْضَعْنَ <br>\
                  بِالقَوْلِ <br>\
                  <i>Then be ye not soft in speech.</i> (TA.) And you say, خَضَعَ لَهَا بِكَلَامِهِ وَخَضَعَتْ لَهُ وَتَطَمَّعَ <br>\
                  فِيهَا [<i>He was soft to her in speech, and she was soft to him, and he became excited to feel an eager desire for her,</i> or <i>to lust after her</i>]; (TA;) and in like manner, ↓ <br>\
      خَاضَعَها, (K, * TA,) inf. n. مُخَاضَعَةٌ, (TA,) [<i>he was soft in his speech to her, she being soft in her speech to him.</i>] And خَضَعَا <br>\

                  <i>They two</i> (a man and a woman) <i>made soft discourse together, saying that which excited each to feel an eager desire for,</i> or <i>to lust after, the other.</i> (TA from a trad.) ―         -b4-  خَضَعَ, aor.      <br>\
                     خَضَعَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. خَضْعٌ, [or, as in two copies of the S, خَضَعٌ, though it seems that the verb is correctly خَضَعَ, not خَضِعَ,] <i>He had a natural stooping of the neck:</i> (TA:) and <i>he bent himself,</i> or <i>became bent;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      اخضع. (Zj.) And ↓ <br>\
      اختضع, said of a hawk, <i>He lowered his head to make a stoop,</i> or <i>to pounce down.</i> (Z, TA.) ―         -b5-  [Hence,] خَضَعَتِ <br>\
                  الاـِبِلُ (tropical:)  <i>The camels strove, or exerted themselves,</i> or <i>hastened, in their pace,</i> or <i>going;</i> (K;) because, when they do so, they lower their necks. (TA.) And ↓ <br>\
      اختضع, (K,) said of a horse, (IAar,) [for the same reason,] (assumed tropical:)  <i>He went quickly,</i> or <i>swiftly.</i> (IAar, K.) ―         -b6-  خَضَعَ النَّجْمُ (tropical:)  <i>The star,</i> or <i>asterism, inclined</i> (S, K, TA) <i>to the place of setting,</i> (S, TA,) or <i>to setting:</i> (K, TA:) and in like manner, خَضَعَتِ الشَّمْسُ (tropical:)  <i>the sun inclined</i> <br>\

                  <i>He,</i> or <i>it, rendered him still</i> (K, TA) [<i>and submissive:</i> see 1]: the verb being both intrans. and trans. (TA.) [See also 4.] ―         -b2-  Also, (K,) inf. n. خَضْعٌ and خُضُوعٌ, (TA,) <i>He,</i> or <i>it, caused him to have a stooping neck;</i> as also ↓ <br>\

      خضّعهُ; for its inf. n.] تَخْضيعٌ signifies the <i>rendering lowly, humble,</i> or <i>submissive;</i> in Persian, فَرُوتَنْ كَرْدَانِيدَنْ. (KL. [But Golius, from the same source, explains the verb as signifying “ Submissum humilemque se commonstravit. ”]) [Hence,] اَخْضَعَتَنِى اـِلَيْكَ <br>\

                   A plant <i>bending by reason of softness,</i> or <i>tenderness:</i> ISd holds it to be formed after the manner of a relative, or possessive, noun, because there is no verb [of the measure خَضِعَ] to which it may be referred.

      خَضُوعٌ signifies the same: (S, K:) [or rather the latter is an intensive epithet, signifying <i>very lowly,</i> &amp;amp;c.:] the pl. of the former is خَاضِعُونَ and خُضَّعٌ and خُضْعَانٌ, or خِضْعَانٌ: (TA:) [respecting the last two of which, see 1, second sentence:] and the pl. of ↓ <br>\
      خَضُوعٌ is خُضُعٌ; (S, K;) as in the phrase قَوْمٌ خُضُعُ الرِّقَابِ [<i>A people,</i> or <i>company of men, very submissive in the necks</i>]. (S.) It is said in the Kur [xxvi. 3], فَظَلَّتْ اَعْنَاقُهُمْ <br>\
                  لَهَا خَاضِعِينَ <br>\
                  <i>And their necks shall continue,</i> the pret. being used in the sense of the aor., meaning تَدُومُ, (Jel,) <i>submissive to it:</i> (Jel, * TA:) the original of the phrase is فَظَلُّوا لَهَا خَاضِعِينَ; and اعناق is redundantly inserted to show the place of خُضُوع, and the predicate is left in its original state: (Bd:) or as the خضوع is only that of the اعناق, it is allowable to make the predicate relate to [the pronoun هم, which is] the complement of the latter word: (Sb, Kh:) or since the خضوع is ascribed to the necks but really belongs to the persons, the epithet has that form of pl. which is proper to rational beings: (Jel: [and the like is said by Bd:]) or اعناقهم means <i>their chiefs:</i> or <i>their companies:</i> but there is another reading [which is literally grammatical], namely خَاضِعَةً. (Bd.) ―         -b2-  The pl. خُضَّعٌ is also applied to Women <i>who have been</i> [<i> or who are</i>] <i>soft in speech, and still.</i> (IAar.)
