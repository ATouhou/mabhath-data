(TA.) And خَلَعَ قَايِدَهُ (tropical:)  [<i>He divested his leader of his authority;</i> or <i>removed him from his office;</i> or <i>dismissed him</i>]. (S, TA.) But IF says, This is scarcely, or never, said, except of an inferior who forsakes, or relinquishes, his superior; so that [خَلَعَهُ signifies, in a case of this kind, (tropical:)  <i>He threw off his allegiance to him;</i> or <i>forsook obedience to him;</i> like another phrase, mentioned above; and] one does not say, [or seldom says,] خَلَعَ الاَمِيرُ وَالِيَهُ عَلَى بَلَدِ كَذَا [as meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>The prince deposed his ruler over such a province,</i> or <i>the like</i>]; but only, [or rather,] عَزَلَهُ.

      خالعها, (Az, TA,) inf. n. مُخَالَعَةٌ; (K;) [and خِلَاعٌ seems to be another inf. n. of this latter verb, rather than of the former;] (tropical:)  <i>He divorced his wife</i> (Az, Mgh, Msb, K) <i>for a ransom given by her,</i> (Msb,) or <i>for her property given by her as a ransom to release herself from him,</i> (Az, Mgh, TA,) or <i>for a gift,</i> or <i>a compensation, from her,</i> (K, accord. to different copies; some having بِبَذْلٍ; and others, بِبَبَدَلٍ;) or <i>from another:</i> (K:) because the wife is [as] a garment to the husband, and the husband to the wife, (Az, Mgh, Msb, TA,) as is said in the Kur ii. 183: (Az, TA:) [it is also said that] ↓ <br>\
      تَخَالُعٌ is syn. with خُلْعٌ: (K:) [but see 6, below:] and اِخْلَعْهَا, occurring in a trad., is explained as signifying <i>Divorce thou her,</i> and <i>quit her.</i> (TA.) ―         -b15-  خَلَعَهُ اَهْلُهُ (tropical:)  [<i>His family cast him off, repudiated him,</i> or <i>renounced him;</i>] <i>so that if he committed a crime,</i> or <i>an offence rendering liable to punishment, they should not be prosecuted for it.</i> (S, TA.) In the Time of Ignorance, when one said, (K, TA,) proclaiming in the fair, or festival, (TA,) يَا اَيُّهَا النَّاسُ هٰذَا اْبْنَى <br>\
                  قَدْ خَلَعْتُهُ, (K, * TA,) meaning [<i>O men, this, my son, I cast off, repudiate,</i> or <i>renounce, him,</i> or] <i>I declare myself to be clear of him; so that if he commit a crime,</i> or <i>an offence rendering him liable to punishment, I am not responsible; and if a crime,</i> or <i>an offence rendering liable to punishment, be committed against him, I will not pursue</i> [<i>for redress,</i> or <i>retaliation</i>]; (TA;) he was not punished afterwards for any such act committed by him: (K, TA:) this was when the person doing so feared some foul action or treachery from his son: and in like manner, they said, اـِنَّا قَدْ خَلَعْنَا فُلَانًا [<i>Verily we cast off,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>such a one</i>]. (TA.) In like manner, also, خَلَعُوهُ, inf. n. خَلْعٌ, signifies (tropical:)  [<i>They cast him off, repudiated him,</i> or <i>renounced him,</i> or] <i>they declared themselves to be clear of him;</i> meaning a confederate; <i>so that they should not be punished for a crime,</i> or <i>an offence rendering liable to punishment, committed by him, nor should he be punished for such an act committed by them.</i> (IAth, L.) In the same sense the verb is used in the saying, نَخْلَعُ وَنَتْرُكُ مَنْ يَفْجُرُكَ [<i>We repudiate,</i> or <i>renounce,</i> or] <i>we declare ourselves clear of, and forsake, him who disobeys,</i> or <i>opposes, Thee:</i> (Mgh, TA:) or نَخْلَعُ وَنَهْجُرُ مَنْ يَكْفُرُكَ <br>\
                  <i>we hate, and</i> [<i>repudiate,</i> or <i>renounce,</i> or] <i>declare ourselves clear of,</i> [<i>and forsake,</i>] <i>him who denies,</i> or <i>disacknowledges, thy favour,</i> or <i>who is ungrateful,</i> or <i>unthankful, for it.</i> (Msb.)       -A2-  خَلُعَ, aor.      <br>\
