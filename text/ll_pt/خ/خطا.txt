                  , (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَخْطِيَةٌ and تَخْطِىْءٌ, (S, K,) <i>He said</i> to him, اَخْطَاْتَ [meaning <i>Thou hast done wrong,</i> or <i>committed a mistake</i> or <i>an error</i>]: (S, Msb, K:) or <i>he pronounced him,</i> or <i>asserted him, to be doing wrong,</i> or <i>committing a mistake</i> or <i>an error.</i> (Msb.)

                  <i>God made,</i> or <i>may God make, its</i> [i. e. a land&#39;s] <i>star,</i> or <i>asterism, to miss;</i> so that the rain which the star or asterism should have brought did not, or shall not, fall upon it. (TA.) This was [also] said by I&#39;Ab [in a tropical sense] with reference to a woman, as an imprecation, in disapproval of her conduct. (Mgh.) As some relate this saying, the verb is خَطَّى, (Mgh, TA,) and the meaning, <i>God made,</i> or <i>may God make, its</i> [<i>rain-giving</i>] <i>star</i> or <i>asterism, to pass it over, and not send rain upon it:</i> and in this case it may be, (TA,) or it is, (Mgh,) from خَطِيطَةٌ, signifying “ a land not rained upon (Mgh, TA) between two lands that have been rained upon; ” (Mgh;) the verb being originally خَطَّطَ, and the final ط being changed into ى. (Mgh, TA. [See art خط.]) نَوْء is [here] the sing. of اَنْوَا=ءٌ meaning the “ Mansions of the Moon, ” also called the “ stars, or asterisms, of rain. ” (Mgh.) [See more in the first paragraph of art. خط: and see also 4 in the present art.] Accord. to Fr, خَطَّى السَّهْمَ and خَطَّاَهُ are syn. [as meaning <i>He made the arrow to pass over,</i> or <i>to miss,</i> the mark]. (TA.) One says also, خُطِّيُ عَنْكَ السُّوْءُ [<i>May evil be made to miss thee;</i>] i. e. <i>may evil be repelled from thee.</i> (ISk.) And خَطَّاَ عَنْكَ السُّوْءُ [app. for ↓تَخَطَّاَ] <i>Evil missed thee,</i> or <i>may evil miss thee.</i> (AZ.)    </entryFree> <br>\

(TA.) See also 5.       -A2-  اخطاهُ, (S, K,) which signifies, <i>He</i> [or <i>it</i>] <i>missed,</i> or <i>failed of hitting, it</i> [or <i>him</i>], (TA,) and ↓تخاطاهُ (S, K) and ↓تخطّاهُ (K) and لَهُ ↓تخطّا (TA) [and ↓خَطِيَهُ, as will be seen from what follows,] are syn.

                  الطَّرِيقَ [<i>He missed the way;</i> or] <i>he deviated from the way.</i> (TA.) And اخطا نَوْوُهُ [(assumed tropical:)  <i>His star,</i> or <i>asterism, missed</i>]; said of him who has sought an object of want and not succeeded in attaining it: (TA:) and to a person in this case one says, اخطا نَوْوُكَ [(assumed tropical:)  <i>Thy star,</i> or <i>asterism, has missed</i>].

(TA.)       -A3-  مَا اَخْطَاَهُ is an expression of wonder [meaning <i>How sinful,</i> or <i>criminal,</i> or <i>intentionally-disobedient,</i> or <i>intentionally-wrongdoing, is he !</i>] from خَطِيَ, not from اَخْطَاَ.
