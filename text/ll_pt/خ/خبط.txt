                  , (Msb, K, TA,) inf. n. خَبْطٌ, (Msb, TA, &amp;amp;c.,) <i>He struck,</i> or <i>beat,</i> (Msb, TA,) anything: (TA:) or <i>he struck,</i> or <i>beat,</i> it, or him, <i>vehemently:</i> (M, K, TA:) or خَبْطٌ signifies a camel&#39;s <i>striking,</i> or <i>beating,</i> a thing <i>with his fore foot:</i> (T, TA:) or in the cases of beasts, (دَوَابّ, [generally meaning horses and mules and asses,]) the <i>striking,</i> or <i>beating, with the fore feet;</i> not with the hind feet: and in the case of the camel, <i>with the fore foot and the hind foot:</i> or <i>vehement treading;</i> or <i>of the fore feet of beasts</i> (دوابّ): (TA:) or, accord. to the Keshsháf, the act of <i>striking,</i> or <i>beating, in a way</i> <br>\
                  <i>that is not right:</i> or, as some say, the <i>going,</i> or <i>journeying, upon what is not the middle,</i> or <i>main part, of the road,</i> or <i>what is not the main road,</i> or <i>upon a road not open to view:</i> or <i>continuous,</i> or <i>consecutive, striking,</i> or <i>beating, in different ways:</i> and afterwards tropically applied to any (tropical:)  <i>beating,</i> or <i>striking, that is not approved:</i> or originally, the <i>striking,</i> or <i>beating, with the fore foot</i> or <i>the hind foot,</i> and <i>the like:</i> (MF, TA:) with the fore feet or legs, it is like رَمْحٌ with the hind feet or legs. (TA.) You say, of a camel, خَبَطَ الاَرْضَ, (Msb,) or خَبَطَ الاَرْضَ بِيَدِهِ, (S, K,) inf. n. as above, (S,) <i>He struck,</i> or <i>beat, the ground with his fore foot:</i> (S, Msb:) or <i>he struck,</i> or <i>beat, vehemently the ground with his fore foot;</i> and ↓ <br>\
      تخبّط and ↓ <br>\
      اختبط signify the same: (K:) it is said in the O that خَبَطَهُ signifies <i>he struck him with his fore foot,</i> or <i>hand, and prostrated him,</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      تخبّطهُ: and ↓ <br>\
      اختبط, said of a camel, is <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  خَبَطَ: and in the T, that بِرِجْلِهِ ↓ <br>\
      تَخَبَّطَنِى is <i>syn, with</i> <br>\
                  خَبَطَنِى. (TA.) Hence the trad., لَا تَخْبِطُوا خَبْطَ الجَمَلِ [lit. <i>Ye shall not beat</i> the ground <i>as the camel does with his fore foot</i> in rising]; meant to forbid a man&#39;s putting forward his foot in rising from prostration [in prayer]. (TA.) And خَبَطَهُ, (K, TA,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,) signifies also <i>He trod him,</i> or <i>it, vehemently,</i> (K, TA,) <i>as the camel does with his fore foot.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  Hence, (S,) فُلَانٌ يَخْبِطُ خَبْطَ عَشْوَا=ءَ (S, * TA) (tropical:)  [<i>Such a one goes at random, in a headstrong and reckless manner,</i>] <i>like the weak-sighted she-camel that beats the ground with her fore feet</i> (تَخْبِطُ) <i>as she goes along, not guarding herself from anything.</i> (S, TA.) It is a prov., applied to him who turns away from a thing as though he were not cognizant of it: or to him who is continually falling into a thing. (Har p. 239.) Zuheyr says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  <i>I saw the fates</i> [<i>treading mankind</i>] <i>like the treading of the weak-sighted she-camel; whom they smote, him they killed: and whom they missed, he was made to continue in life so that he lived to extreme old age.</i> (TA, and EM p. 132.) In like manner you say, فُلَانٌ يَخْبِطُ فِى عَمْيَا=ءَ (tropical:)  <i>Such a one undertakes what he undertakes with ignorance.</i> (TA.) And خَبَطَ اَمْرَهُ عَلَى غَيْرِ بَصيرَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He prosecuted his affair without mental perception,</i> or <i>without certainty</i>]. (S in art. عشو, q. v.) And يَخْبِطُ فِى الظَّلَامِ (tropical:)  <i>He goes in the night without a lamp, and so becomes confounded and perplexed, and unable to see his right course, and errs from the way, and perchance may fall into a well.</i> (TA.) And خَبَطَ اللَّيْلَ, (K, TA,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,) (tropical:)  <i>He went,</i> or <i>journeyed, in the night without direction.</i> (K, TA.) And بَاتَ <br>\
                  يَخْبِطُ الظَّلْمَا=ءَ (tropical:)  [<i>He passed the night traversing the darkness without direction</i>]. (TA.) خَبْطٌ is said to signify (assumed tropical:)  The act of <i>journeying,</i> or <i>going, without direction:</i> or <i>upon what is not the middle,</i> or <i>main part, of the road,</i> or <i>what is not the main road.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  [And hence, perhaps,] خَبَطَهُ (tropical:)  <i>He asked of him a benefit,</i> or <i>favour, without any tie of relationship;</i> (K, * TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
      اختبطهُ: (IB, K:) or this is from خَبْطُ وَرَقِ الشَّجَرِ [explained in what follows]: (Har p. 425:) or the latter, [or both,] <i>he came to him seeking his beneficence without any such tie:</i> (S:) <i>or he came to him seeking a gift;</i> because he who does so must beat the ground with his feet: (IF:) and you also say, مَعْرُوفَهُ ↓ <br>\
      اختبط. (Aboo-Málik, TA.) [The latter verb is the more common. See also 10.] ―         -b4-  And (tropical:)  <i>He conferred a benefit upon him without there having been any acquaintance between them,</i> (S, K, TA,) <i>and without there being anything to draw them near, and without there being any relationship:</i> (TA:) and خَبَطَهُ بِخَيْرِ signifies <i>the same:</i> (TA:) or <i>he bestowed on him a benefit,</i> (K, TA,) <i>being asked:</i> (TA:) and you say also, بِخَيْرٍ ↓ <br>\
      اختبطهُ: (Aboo-Málik, TA:) and خَبَطَ فِيهِمْ بِخَيْرٍ signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>He benefited them.</i> (TA.) &#39;Alkameh Ibn-&#39;Abadeh says, (S, TA,) praising El-Hárith Ibn-AbeeShemir, (TA,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَفِى كُلِّ حَىٍّ قَدْ خَبَطْتَ بِنِعْمَةٍ<br>\
                  </quote> (assumed tropical:)  [<i>And upon every tribe thou hast conferred benefit,</i> app. meaning <i>without being related to them</i>]: (S, TA:) but it is said in a marginal note to the S, that خَبَطَّ would be better; and so it is accord. to one relation: in the L, however, it is said that خَبَتَّ would be more agreeable with analogy. (TA.) Accord. to AZ, خَبَطْتُ الرَّجُلَ, inf. n. خَبْطٌ, signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>I held loving communion, commerce,</i> or <i>intercourse, with the man.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  [In respect of the places which I have given to the abovementioned significations of asking and conferring a benefit, I have followed the opinion of IF; but it is said in the TA, and, I think, with greater probability, that they are from what here next follows.] ―         -b6-  خَبَطَ الوَرَقَ مِنَ الشَّجَرِ, aor.      <br>\
                     خَبِطَ<br>\
                  , (Msb,) inf. n. خَبْطٌ, (Lth, T, Msb,) <i>He made the leaves to fall from the trees:</i> (Msb:) or <i>he beat the leaves of the trees,</i> (Lth, T,) meaning large trees of the kind called طَلْح, [acacia, or mimosa, gummifera,] <i>with a staff,</i> or <i>stick,</i> (Lth,) <i>so that they fell off,</i> or <i>became scattered,</i> (Lth, T,) after which he gave them as food to camels; (Lth;) <i>refrainfrom injuring thereby the trunks and branches of the trees:</i> (T:) and لَهُ خَبَطًا ↓ <br>\
      اختبط signifies the same as خَبَطَ. (TA.) And خَبَطَ الشَّجَرَةَ, (S, K,) aor. as above, (TA,) and so the inf. n., (S,) <i>He beat the tree with a staff,</i> or <i>stick, in order that its leaves might fall off:</i> (S:) or <i>he bound the tree, and then made its leaves to fall,</i> (K, TA,) <i>by beating it</i> with a staff, or stick, to give them as food to camels and other beasts. (TA.) The leaves are stored up for the camels; and in wintertime are bruised, or broken up, for them, and moistened with water, and given to them as fodder. (Har p. 218.) Mohammad was asked, Does الغَبْط [i. e. “ the wishing for a blessing on the condition that it shall not become transferred from its possessor ”] injure [its author]? and he answered, لَا اـِلَّا كَمَا يَضُرُّ العِضَاهَ الخَبْطُ [<i>No, save as the beating off the leaves injures the</i> trees called <i>&#39;idáh</i>]; i. e., it only diminishes, without annulling, its author&#39;s recompense, like the beating off the leaves of the &#39;idáh, without cutting them down and extirpating them; for the leaves will grow again. (TA.) [See also art. غبط.] ―         -b7-  Hence, (A, TA,) خَبَطَ القَوْمَ بِسَيْفِهِ (tropical:)  <i>He struck the people with his sword.</i> (A, K, TA.) ―         -b8-  خَبَطَهُ الشَّيْطَانُ (tropical:)  <i>The devil touched him with a hurt,</i> (K, TA,) <i>so as to corrupt him,</i> or <i>disorder him, and render him insane;</i> (TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
      تخبّطهُ: (K, TA:) or the latter, [which is the more common,] <i>the devil corrupted him,</i> or <i>disordered him:</i> (S, Mgh, Msb: *) lit., <i>struck him:</i> (Mgh, Msb:) or <i>prostrated him, and sported with him:</i> or <i>trampled upon him, and prostrated him.</i> (TA.) It is said in the Kur [ii. 276], ↓ <br>\
      لَا يَقُومُونَ اـِلَّا كَمَا يَقُومُ اْلَّذِى يَتَخَبَّطُهُ <br>\
                  الشَّيْطَانُ مِنَ اْلْمَسِّ (tropical:)  [<i>They shall not rise save as he riseth whom the devil prostrateth by reason of possession,</i> or <i>insanity</i>]; i. e., as he who is affected by diabolical possession rises, in his state of possession, when he is prostrated, and falls: or it means, <i>whom the devil corrupts,</i> or <i>disorders, by rendering him insane.</i> (K, * TA.) [You say also, of a drug, العَقْلَ ↓ <br>\
      خبّط (assumed tropical:)  <i>It disordered the intellect:</i> see the act. part. n., below.] ―         -b9-  خَبَطَ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>He</i> (a man) <i>threw himself down</i> (S, L, K) <i>where he was,</i> (S, L,) <i>to sleep,</i> (S, K,) or <i>and slept.</i> (L.) And (assumed tropical:)  <i>He</i> (a man) <i>slept.</i> (A&#39; Obeyd, TA.) In the K, قَامَ is erroneously put for نَامَ. (TA.) ―         -b10-  خَبَطَ عَلَى البَابِ <br>\
