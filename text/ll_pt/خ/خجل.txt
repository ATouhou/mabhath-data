                  , (K,) inf. n. خَجَلٌ, (S, Msb, &amp;amp;c.,) but not خَجَالَةٌ, [though authorized by the KL, in my copy of which I find it thus written (not خِجَالَةٌ as written by Golius),] for this is a vulgar mistake for خَجَلَةٌ or خَجْلٌ, (Mgh, [so in my copy, but correctly ↓ <br>\

(Msb.) ―         -b2-  And <i>He remained silent,</i> (T, K,) or <i>still,</i> (M,) <i>not speaking nor moving.</i> (K.) ―         -b3-  And <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, in a confused and dubious case,</i> (JK, M, * K, *) <i>so that he knew not how to extricate himself from it.</i> (M, K.) ―         -b4-  Also, said of a camel, (tropical:)  <i>He went in mud, and became like him who is confounded,</i> or <i>perplexed, and unable to see his right course:</i> (JK, * M, K, TA:) or <i>he stuck fast in mire.</i> (T, TA.) ―         -b5-  And in like manner, (assumed tropical:)  <i>He became agitated,</i> or <i>convulsed,</i> or <i>he struggled,</i> or <i>floundered, with his load:</i> (JK:) or خَجِلَ بِالْحِمْلِ <br>\
                  <i>he was oppressed by the load,</i> (K, TA,) <i>so that he was agitated,</i> or <i>convulsed,</i> or <i>he struggled,</i> or <i>floundered, beneath it.</i> (TA.) ―         -b6-  And, said of a plant, or of herbage, (tropical:)  <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, tall, and tangled,</i> or <i>luxuriant,</i> or <i>abundant and dense;</i> (ISd, K, TA;) and so ↓ <br>\
      اخجل said of the kind of trees termed حَيْض.

It is related in a trad. that he [Mohammad] said to the women, اـِذَا جُعْتُنَّ وَ اـِذَا شَبِعْتُنَّ خَجِلْتُنَّ, (S, * TA,) i. e. <i>When ye are hungry, ye become lowly, humble,</i> or <i>submissive, and cleave to the dust,</i> or <i>earth;</i> (S and TA in art. دقع;) or <i>ye bear poverty ill:</i> (TA in the present art.;) <i>and when ye are satiated,</i> [<i>ye bear richness ill;</i> or] <i>ye exult,</i> or <i>exult greatly</i> or <i>excessively, and behave insolently and unthankfully.</i> (S in the present art.)
