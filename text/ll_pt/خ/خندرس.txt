                  <i>Wine;</i> (S, K;) so called because of its oldness: (S:) or <i>old wine:</i> (TA:) [accord. to some,] derived from خَدْرَسَةٌ, a word not explained: (K:) by some said to be of the measure فَنْعَلِيسٌ, so that its radical letters are خدر; because wine is مُخَدِّر [i. e. a cause of torpor or languor]: by some said to be from خَرْسٌ; but to this it is objected that د is not augmentative: the truth is, that it is of the measure فَعْلَلِيلٌ, as Sb says: (MF:) by the author of the L and others, it is mentioned after art. خنس: (TA:) or it is a Greek word, arabicized: (K:) [but I know not how this is, unless, as an epithet applied to wheat, (see what follows,) it be supposed to be from        <br>\
