                  <i>Any soft and weak tree:</i> (K:) or such is called خنورة [i. e. خَنُّورَةٌ or حَنَوَّرَةٌ: each, without ة, being app. a coll. gen. n.; and with ة, a n. un.]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  And hence, accord. to AHn, (TA,) The <i>reeds of</i> [<i>which are made</i>] <i>arrows.</i> (K.)       -A2-  اُمُّ خَنُّورٍ (S, K) and اُمُّ خِنَّوْرٍ (K) <i>The female hyena:</i> (S, K:) or she is called by the latter appellation, accord. to Aboo-Riyásh: or, as some say, these are surnames of <i>the hyena.</i> (TA.) And <i>The cow</i> [probably <i>the wild cow</i>]. (Aboo-Riyásh, K.) ―         -b2-  Also <i>Calamity,</i> or <i>misfortune.</i> (S, K.) You say, وَقَعَ القَوْمُ فِى اُمِّ خَنُّورٍ <br>\
                  <i>The people,</i> or <i>party, fell into calamity,</i> or <i>misfortune.</i> (L, TA. But see two other explanations in what follows.) ―         -b3-  And <i>Plentifulness, and pleasantness</i> or <i>easiness, and softness</i> or <i>delicacy, of life;</i> or <i>a life of softness</i> or <i>delicacy, and ease, comfort,</i> or <i>affluence;</i> syn. النَّعْمَةُ: [in the CK النِّعْمَةُ; which is in many instances in the CK, as I hold it to be in the present instance, erroneously substituted for النَّعْمَةُ:] thus bearing two contrary significations: and الخَنُّورُ and ↓ <br>\
      الخَنَوَّرُ signify the same, <i>such as is apparent;</i> (K;) or, as some say, <i>abundant.</i> (TA.) Some explain the saying above-mentioned as meaning <i>The people,</i> or <i>party, fell into a state of plenty,</i> or <i>abundance, and softness</i> or <i>delicacy</i> or <i>easiness of life.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  And <i>The present world;</i> or <i>the present life,</i> or <i>state of existence;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
