                  , (JK, K, * and TA in art. زكو,) without tenween, and accord. to some with tenween, and not having the article ال prefixed to it; and in like manner زَكَا, which is coupled with the former, is without tenween, and accord. to some with tenween, and not having the article ال prefixed to it; (TA in that art.;) [but each has ال prefixed to it in the K;] accord. to Fr, some make it quasi-coordinate to فَتًى [i. e. with tenween, and masc.]; some, to زفر [app. meaning the proper name زُفَرُ i. e. without tenween, and masc.]; and some, to سَكْرَى [app. meaning without tenween, and fem.]: (TA:) a word that is said in playing with walnuts; (JK;) <i>An odd number:</i> (Lth, Fr, K, TA:) and زكا signifies an even number: (Lth, Fr, TA:) accord. to IB, its final letter is hemzeh, for one says, يُخَاسِيُ meaning يُقَامِرُ [he contends in a game of hazard]; but it is pronounced without ء to assimilate it to زكا: (TA:) the pl. is اَخَاسٍ, (K, TA,) accord. to the M, مَخَاسٍ, like مَسَاوٍ, (TA, [but the former pl. occurs in a verse cited in the TA,]) which is anomalous. (K.) One says, خَسًا اَوْ زَكًا, [so in my copies of the S, with tenween,] i. e. <i>Odd or even?</i> (S:) [or خَسَا اَوْ زَكَا, as shown above:] and some say, خَسَا زَكَا, like خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ. (IB, TA.) And it is said in a trad., مَا اَدْرِى كَمْ حَدَّثَنِى <br>\
                  اَبِى عِنْ رَسُولِ اْللّٰهِ صَلَّى اْللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ اَخْسَا اَمْ <br>\
                  زَكَا, or اَخْسًا اَمْ زَكًا, [for the vowel-signs are not written in my original,] meaning فَرْدًا اَمْ زَوْجًا [i. e. <i>I know not how many times my father told me, from the Apostle of God, God bless and save him; whether an odd or an even number:</i> or, perhaps, <i>once or twice</i>].
