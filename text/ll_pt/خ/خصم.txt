                  , inf. n. مُخَاصَمَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and خِصَامٌ (S, Msb) and [quasi-inf. n.] خُصُومَةٌ, (K,) the last said in the S to be a simple subst., (TA,) <i>He contended with him in an altercation, disputed with him,</i> or <i>litigated with him;</i> (K, TA;) <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  نَازَعَهُ: (Mgh and Msb and K in art. نزع:) accord. to El-Harállee, الخِصَامُ signifies <i>the saying which the listener is made to hear, and which is made to enter his ear-hole, such as may cause him to refrain,</i> or <i>desist, from his assertion, and his plea,</i> or <i>claim.</i> (TA.) You say, خَاصَمْتُهُ ↓ <br>\
      فَخَصَمْتُهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *) aor. of the latter اَخْصِمُهُ, with kesr, (S, K, *) or اَخْصُمُهُ, with damm, (Mgh, Msb,) or not with damm, (S,) or both these forms of the aor. are used, accord. to AHei; the latter agreeable with analogy; (MF;) the former anomalous; for the regular aor. of an unaugmented sound verb in a case of this kind is with damm, (S, K,) as in the instance of عَالَمْتُهُ فَعَلَمْتُهُ, aor. اَعْلُمُهُ; (S;) if it has not a faucial letter (S, K) for its medial radical, (K,) in which case it is with fet-h, as in the instance of فَاخَرْتُهُ <br>\
                  فَفَخَرْتُهُ, aor. اَفْخَرُهُ, (S, K,) accord. to the opinion of Ks, but this is contr. to the opinion generally held: (MF:) the inf. n. of خَصَمْتُهُ is خَصْمٌ: (S, * TA:) and the meaning is, [<i>I contended with him in an altercation,</i> or <i>I disputed,</i> or <i>litigated, with him, and</i>] <i>I overcame him in the altercation,</i> &amp;amp;c. (Mgh, Msb.)       -A2-  خاصمهُ also signifies <i>He put it in,</i> or <i>by, the</i> <br>\

                  <i>He dictated to him his plea against his adversary in an altercation</i> or <i>a dispute</i> or <i>litigation,</i> (JK, TA,) <i>whereby he might overcome the latter.</i> (JK.)    </entryFree> <br>\

      تخاصموا; (S, K, TA;) both signifying as above. (TA.) He who reads يَخَصِّمُونَ [in the Kur xxxvi. 49] means يَخْتَصِمُونَ; changing the ت into ص, and incorporating [it into the other ص], and transferring its vowel to the خ: some read يَخِصِّمُونَ, without transferring that vowel; (S, K;) because a quiescent letter, when it is made movent, is [regularly] made so with kesr: (S:) AA slurred the vowel of the خ: the pronunciation [يَخْصِّمُونَ] with two quiescent letters together is incorrect: (S, K:) Hamzeh read ↓ <br>\
      يَخْصِمُونَ, (S,) i. e., with the خ quiescent and with kesr to the ص. (TA.) ―         -b2-  اِخْتَصَمَا اـِلَيْهِ <br>\
                  <i>They two applied to him for the decision of a cause, each of them claiming the right.</i> (TA in art. قمط.) And اـِلَيْهِ ↓ <br>\
      تُخُوصِمَ [<i>An application was made to him by litigants for the decision of a cause</i>]. (Mgh in art. دلو.)       -A2-  السَّيْفُ يَخْتَصِمُ جَفْنَهُ, said by J to signify <i>The sword cuts</i> (lit. <i>eats</i>) <i>its scabbard, by reason of its sharpness,</i> is a mistake; the verb being correctly with ض, (K, * TA,) dotted.

[of pauc.] اَخْصَامٌ and [of mult.] خُصُومٌ: (K:) but some say that the اَخْصَام of the [water-bag termed] مَزَادَة, and its خُصُوم, are its <i>corners:</i> the خُصُوم of a cloud are its <i>sides:</i> (TA:) and اَخْصَامُ العَيْنِ signifies <i>the part,</i> or <i>parts, of the eye upon which the edges of the lids close together.</i> (S, K.) ―         -b2-  [Also <i>A gap,</i> or <i>an intervening space:</i> it is said in the TA that] الاَخْصَامُ [pl. of الخُصْمُ] signifies الفرج [i. e. الفُرَجُ, pl. of الفُرْجَةُ: and it is added,] one says, of an unsound, a corrupt, or a disordered, affair, لَا يُسَّدُ مِنْهُ خُصْمٌ اـِلَّا اْنْفَتَحَ خُصْمٌ ا=خَرُ (tropical:)  [<i>A gap of it will not be stopped up but another gap will open</i>]; occurring in a trad., meaning, the state of affairs is disordered and distressing, and not to be rectified and repaired. (TA.) ―         -b3-  [The pl.] خُصُومٌ also signifies The <i>mouths of valleys.</i> (JK, K.) ―         -b4-  And The <i>lower parts,</i> or <i>stocks,</i> syn. اُصُولٌ, (JK, K,) of [trees of the kind called] سَرَحَات [pl. of سَرْحَةٌ]; used in this sense by Et- Tirimmáh.

      خَصِيمٌ: (Msb:) or this last signifies one <i>who contends with another in an altercation, disputes with him,</i> or <i>litigates with him:</i> (IB, TA:) the pl. of the first is خَصِمُونَ, (K,) occurring in the Kur xliii. 58; and perhaps اَخْصَامٌ, or this may be a pl. of خَصْمٌ.
