Th says, on the authority of IAar, that عِلْمُ الخَطِّ is عِلْمُ الرَّمْلِ [or <i>geomancy</i>]: I &#39;Ab says that it is an ancient science, which men have relinquished: but Lth says that it is practised to the present time; [to which I may add, that it has not even now ceased; being still practised on sand and the like, and also on paper;] and they have conventional terms which they employ in it, and they elicit thereby the secret thoughts &amp;amp;c., and often hit upon the right therein: the diviner comes to a piece of soft ground, and he has a boy, with whom is a style; and the master makes many lines, or marks, in haste, that they may not be counted; then he returns, and obliterates leisurely lines, or marks, two by two; and if there remain two lines, or marks, they are a sign of success, and of the attainment of the thing wanted: while he obliterates, his boy says, for the sake of auguring well, اِبْنَىْ عِيَانْ اَسْرِعَا البَيَانْ [<i>O two sons of &#39;Iyán</i> (meaning two lines or marks), <i>hasten ye the manifestation</i>]: I &#39;Ab says that when he has obliterated the lines, or marks, and one remains, it is the sign of disappointment: and AZ and Lth relate the like of this.

                  <i>Spears of El-Khatt;</i> so called from الخَطُّ, a place in El-Yemámeh, (S, Msb,) also called خَطُّ هَجَرٍ, (S,) because they are brought thither (S, Msb) from India, (S,) and straightened in that place, (S, Msb, *) which is a coast for ships; not that the canes grow there: (Msb:) or they are so called from الخَطُّ which is the station for ships in El-Bahreyn, because they are sold there; not that it is the place of their growth: this place is also called الخِطُّ: (K:) but this demands consideration; for it is said [in the &#39;Eyn, i. e.] by Lth, (TA,) or by Kh, (Msb,) that when you convert the rel. n. into a subst., you say ↓ <br>\
      خِطِيَّةٌ, (Msb, TA,) with kesr to the خ, (Msb,) without رماح, like as you say, ثِيَابٌ قِبْطِيَّةٌ, (Msb, TA,) with kesr, (Msb,) but when you convert the rel. n. into a subst., you say, قُبْطِيَّةٌ, (Msb, TA,) with damm, to distinguish the subst. from the rel. n., without ثياب: (Msb:) a single spear of this kind is called رُمْحٌ خَطِّىٌّ: (TA:) AHn says that الخَطِّىُّ signifies <i>the spears;</i> and that it is a rel. n. used in the manner of a proper name; being a rel. n. from الخَطُّ, which is خَطُّ البَحْرَيْنِ, where ships moor when they come from India.
