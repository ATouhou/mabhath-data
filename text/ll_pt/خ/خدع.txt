                  , inf. n. خَدْعٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and خِدْعٌ, (AZ, S, K,) or the latter is a simple subst., (Msb, TA,) and خَدِيعَةٌ, (TA,) or this [also] is a simple subst., (Msb, TA,) like خِدَاعٌ, [which is also an inf. n. of 3,] and like خُدٌعَةٌ, (TA,) <i>He deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented,</i> or <i>outwitted, him;</i> syn. خَتَلَهُ; (S, Mgh, K;) and <i>desired to do to him a foul, an abominable,</i> or <i>an evil, action, without his knowing whence it proceeded:</i> (S, K:) or <i>he dissembled</i> [or <i>acted deceitfully</i>] <i>with him; pretended to him the contrary of what he concealed:</i> (TA:) or <i>he made him to resign,</i> or <i>relinquish, the object that he had in view, by pretending to him something the contrary of what he concealed:</i> (Er-Rághib, B:) and ↓ <br>\
      خادعهُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. مُخَادَعَةٌ (S) [and خِدَاعٌ], signifies the same; (S, * TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
      اختدعهُ; and ↓ <br>\
      تخدّعهُ; and ↓ <br>\
      خدّعهُ, inf. n. تَخْدِيعٌ: (TA:) or this last signifies <i>he deceived him, deluded him, beguiled him, circumvented him,</i> or <i>outwitted him, much:</i> (KL:) [and of another of these verbs we find the following various explanations:] ↓ <br>\
      خادعهُ is <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  كَايَدَهُ [which has the first of the meanings assigned in this sentence to خَدَعَهُ; or signifies <i>he practised with him mutual deceit, delusion, guile,</i> or <i>circumvention; he deceived him,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>being deceived,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>by him;</i> and this latter meaning, if not each meaning, may be intended here by كايده; for Bd says, (in ii. 8,) that مُخَادَعَة is between two]: (TA:) or it signifies <i>he strove, endeavoured,</i> or <i>desired, to deceive, delude, beguile, circumvent,</i> or <i>outwit, him;</i> (AAF, L;) [agreeably with what is said by Kemál Páshá Zádeh, (as I find in a marginal note in a copy of the MS, and also in the Kull p. 178,) that one says of a man خادع when he has not attained his desire, and خَدَعَ when he has attained his desire;] for many a verb of the measure فَاعَلَ relates to one only; as in the instances of عَاقَبْتُ اللِّصَّ and طَارَقْتُ <br>\
                  النَّعْلَ: (L:) or it signifies, [like خَدَعَهُ,] <i>he pretended to him something different from that which was in his mind.</i> (K.) It is said in the Kur [ii. 8], اْللّٰهَ وَاْلَّذِينَ ا=مَنُوا ↓ <br>\
      يُخَادِعُونَ, (TA,) meaning <i>They pretend, to God and to those who have believed, something different from that which is in their minds,</i> by concealing unbelief and pretending belief; for when they do thus to the believers, they do thus to God: (K:) and again, [in iv. 141], اْللّٰهَ وَهُوَ خَادِعُهُمْ ↓ <br>\
      يُخَادِعُونَ [<i>They strive, endeavour,</i> or <i>desire, to deceive God,</i> or] <i>they think that they deceive God, but He is</i> [<i>their deceiver,</i> i. e.,] <i>the requiter, to them, of their</i> <br>\
                  خِدَاع [or <i>deceit,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (TA:) or the meaning is [<i>they deceive</i>] <i>the friends of God:</i> (S:) and [agreeably with this last rendering, and that given in the K,] Aboo-Hayáh reads, in the former passage, يَخْدَعُونَ اْللّٰهَ: (TA:) [which passage continues thus:] اـِلَّا اَنْفُسَهُمْ ↓ <br>\
      وَمَا يُخَادِعُونَ [<i>but they do not deceive any save themselves</i>]; i. e., <i>the re-</i> <br>\
                  <i>sult of their</i> <br>\
                  خِدَاع [or <i>deceit</i>] <i>does not befall any save themselves:</i> (K:) here, again, Aboo-Hayáh reads يَخْدَعُونَ: (TA:) Muärrik reads وَمَا ↓ <br>\
      يَخَدِّعُونَ, meaning يَخْتَدِعُونَ. (K.) Accord. to IAar, الخَدْعُ signifies مَنْعُ الحَقِّ [meaning <i>The preventing from discovering,</i> or <i>accepting, the truth</i>]. (L.) [“ He deceived him, ” or the like, seems to be generally regarded as the primary signification of خَدَعَهُ, for it occupies the first place in all the lexicons to which I have access: but Bd says (in ii. 8) that this meaning is from خَدَعَ said of the ضَبِّ, and that the primary signification of خَدْعٌ is the act of “ concealing: ” the action of the ضبّ, however, as will appear in what follows, implies, and originates from, a desire of deceit; and so, often, does the act of concealing.] ―         -b4-  [Hence, app.,] خَدَعْتُهُ <br>\
                  <i>I gained the mastery over him.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  خَدَعَ, (Lth, TA, &amp;amp;c.,) aor.      <br>\
                     خَدَعَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. خَدْعٌ, (TA,) said of a [lizard of the kind called] ضَبّ, [as though meaning either خَدَعَ المُحْتَرِشَ <br>\
                  <i>It deceived the hunter,</i> or خَدَعَ نَفْسَهُ <br>\
                  <i>it concealed itself,</i>] signifies <i>it entered into its hole;</i> (Lth;) as also خَدَعَ فِى حُجْرِهِ: (S, K:) or <i>it scented a man, and therefore entered its hole, in order that it might not be caught;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      انخدع: (TA:) or <i>it entered into its hole in a tortuous manner:</i> and in like manner, a gazelle <i>into its covert:</i> but mostly said of a ضبّ: (Abu-l-&#39;Omeythil:) also said of other things: (Lth:) of a fox, meaning <i>he took to going to the right and left, deceitfully,</i> or <i>guilefully:</i> and of a man, meaning <i>he hid himself</i> from another: and <i>he assumed a disposition not his own.</i> (TA.) [See also خِدَاعٌ, below.] ―         -b6-  Hence, i. e. from خَدَعَ said of the ضبّ, (A, TA,) خَدَعَتْ عَيْنُ الشَّمْسِ (tropical:)  <i>The disc of the sun set;</i> (A, K, TA;) like خَضَعَتْ. (TA in art. خضع.) ―         -b7-  [And] خَدَعَتْ عَيْنُهُ (tropical:)  <i>His eye sank,</i> or <i>became depressed, in his head.</i> (Lh, K, TA.) [Also meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>His eye did not sleep:</i> for] خَدَعَتِ <br>\
                  العَيْنُ signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>the eye did not sleep.</i> (TA.) ―         -b8-  [Hence also, as indicated in the S,] مَا خَدَعَتْ <br>\
                  فِى عَيْنِى نَعْسَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>A slumber did not enter my eye</i>]: (S:) or مَا خَدَعَتْ بِعَيْنِهِ نَعْسَةٌ, (so in the L,) or خَدْعَةٌ, i. e. نَعْسَةٌ, (so in the TA,) meaning (tropical:)  <i>a slumber did not pass by his eye.</i> (L, TA.) [And from the same source have originated several other tropical significations, of which exs. here follow.] ―         -b9-  خَدَعَتِ الاُمُورِ (tropical:)  <i>The affairs varied in their state;</i> or <i>were,</i> or <i>became, variable.</i> (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.) ―         -b10-  خَدَعَتِ السُّوقُ, (S, K,) inf. n. خَدْعٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  [<i>The market varied in its state; at one time being brisk, and at another time dull, in respect of traffic:</i> (see خَادِعٌ, below:) or] <i>the market became dull in respect of traffic;</i> (S, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      انخدعت; (Lh, TA;) or انخدع: (K: [but سوق is generally fem.:]) and, as some say, <i>it became brisk in respect of traffic:</i> thus it appears to have two contr. significations: (TA:) and خَدَعَ السِّعْرُ (tropical:)  <i>The price became high,</i> or <i>dear.</i> (TA.) ―         -b11-  Said of a man, خَدَعَ also signifies (tropical:)  <i>His wealth,</i> (K, TA,) and <i>the like,</i> (TA,) <i>became small in amount,</i> or <i>little.</i> (K, TA.) ―         -b12-  Said of a time, inf. n. خَدْعٌ, (tropical:)  <i>Its rain became little:</i> (TA:) and of rain, (tropical:)  <i>It became little.</i> (K, TA.) ―         -b13-  Said of spittle, or saliva, (tropical:)  <i>It dried:</i> (S, K, TA:) or <i>it became little, and dried,</i> in the mouth: (A, TA.) or <i>it became deficient;</i> and when it becomes deficient, it becomes thick; and when it becomes thick, it becomes stinking: (TA:) or <i>it became corrupt:</i> (IAar, TA:) and in like manner, said of a thing, <i>it became corrupt,</i> or <i>bad.</i> (TA.) [See also خَادِعٌ, below.] ―         -b14-  Said of a generous man, (K,) (tropical:)  <i>He refrained</i> [from giving], (S, L, K,) <i>and refused.</i> (L.) You say, كَانَ فُلَانٌ يُعْطِى ثُمَّ خَدَعَ (tropical:)  [<i>Such a one used to give; then he refrained, and refused</i>]. (S.)       -A2-  خَدَعَهُ aor.      <br>\
