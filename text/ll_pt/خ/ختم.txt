                  , (Msb, K,) inf. n. خَتْمٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and خِتَامٌ, (Lh, K, TA,) with kesr, (TA,) [in the CK, erroneously, خَتَام,] <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  طَبَعَهُ [<i>He sealed, stamped, imprinted,</i> or <i>impressed, it</i>]: (Msb, K:) or <i>he put the</i> <br>\
                  خَاتَم [or <i>signet</i>] <i>upon it:</i> (Mgh:) namely, a thing, (S, Mgh,) or a writing or book and the like: and خَتَمَ عَلَيْهِ signifies the same [or <i>he put a seal,</i> or <i>the impression of a signet, upon it</i>]. (Msb.) Accord. to Er-Rághib, خَتْمٌ and طَبْعٌ signify The <i>impressing</i> a thing <i>with the engraving of the signet and stamp:</i> and the former [as is indicated, but not plainly expressed, as distinguished from the latter,] is tropically used, sometimes, as meaning the <i>securing oneself</i> from a thing, and <i>protecting</i> [<i>oneself</i>] from it; in consideration of protection by means of sealing upon writings and doors: and sometimes as meaning the <i>producing an impression,</i> or <i>effect,</i> upon a thing from another thing; in consideration of the impress produced [by the signet]: and sometimes it is used as relating to (assumed tropical:)  the <i>reaching the end</i> [of a thing]: (TA:) or the primary signification of خَتْمٌ is the act of <i>covering over</i> [a thing]: (Az, TA:) accord. to Zj, the proper meaning of خَتْمٌ and طَبْعٌ is the <i>covering over</i> a thing, <i>and securing oneself from a thing&#39;s entering</i> it: some say that the former signifies the <i>concealing a notification</i> of a thing, [<i>as</i>] <i>by putting one&#39;s fingers over</i> it, <i>by way of guarding oneself thereby.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  Hence, خَتْمُ الشَّهَادَةِ [<i>The sealing of the testimony</i>]; which is thus described by El-Hulwánee: the witness, when he wrote his name upon a صَكّ [q. v.], caused his written name to be beneath a piece of lead, [i. e. covered it with a piece of lead,] and put upon it the impress of his signet, in order that there might be no falsification of it or substitution for it. (Mgh.) ―         -b3-  As to خَتْمُ الاَعْنَاقِ [<i>The sealing of the necks</i>], the case is related, in the “Risáleh Yoosufeeyeh,” to have been this: &#39;Omar sent Ibn-Honeyf to seal the عُلُوج [or unbelievers] of the Sawád; and he sealed five hundred thousand of them, in classes; that is, he marked them twelve dirhems, and twenty-four, and forty-eight; tying a thong upon the neck of each, and putting upon the knot a seal of lead. (Mgh.) ―         -b4-  خَتْمٌ also signifies The <i>protecting</i> what is in a writing <i>by marking</i> [or <i>stamping</i>] <i>a piece of clay</i> [upon it, or <i>by means of a seal of any kind</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b5-  And you say, of a man, خَتَمَ <br>\
                  عَلَيْكَ بَابَهُ [<i>He sealed his door against thee</i>]; meaning (tropical:)  <i>he turned away from thee, avoided thee,</i> or <i>shunned thee.</i> (TA.) ―         -b6-  And خَتَمَ لَكَ بَابَهُ [<i>He sealed for thee his door</i>]; meaning (tropical:)  <i>he preferred thee to others.</i> (TA.) ―         -b7-  خَتَمَ عَلَى قَلْبِهِ [which may be rendered <i>He sealed his heart</i>] means (tropical:)  <i>he made him to be such that he understood not, and such that nothing proceeded from him;</i> or <i>he made his heart,</i> or <i>mind, to be such that it understood not,</i> &amp;amp;c. (K, TA.) خَتَمَ اْللّٰهُ عَلَى <br>\
                  قُلُوبِهِمْ, in the Kur [ii. 6], is like the phrase in the same [xvi. 110 and xlvii. 18] طَبَعَ اْللّٰهُ عَلَى <br>\
                  قُلُوبِهِمْ: (TA:) it points to what God has made to be usually the case when a man has ended in believing what is false and in committing that which is forbidden, so that he turns not his face to the truth; this occasioning, as its result, his becoming inured to the approval of acts of disobedience, so that he is as though this habit were impressed upon his heart: the assertion of ElJubbáee, that it means <i>God hath put a seal upon their hearts,</i> as a sign, to the angels, of their infidelity, is nought: (Er-Rághib, TA:) الخَتْمُ is explained by IAar as meaning <i>the preventing</i> of the heart <i>from believing.</i> (L in art. خدع.) [See also طَبَعَ.] ―         -b8-  خَتَمَ الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. خَتْمٌ, also signifies [as indicated above] (assumed tropical:)  <i>He reached the end of the thing.</i> (K.) And الشَّىْءَ ↓ <br>\

It is said of Suleymán El-Aamash, كَانَ يَقْرَاُ خَتْمًا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>He used to recite the whole of the Kur-án;</i> at one time, according to the reading of Ibn-Mes&#39;ood; at another time, from the edition of &#39;Othmán. (Mgh.) ―         -b9-  You say also, خَتَمَ اْللّٰهُ لَهُ بِخَيْرٍ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>May God make his end to be good</i>]. (S.) ―         -b10-  خَتَمَ البَذْرَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He covered over the sown seed:</i> (Az, TA:) or خَتَمُوا عَلَى البَذْرِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>they turned up the earth over the sown seed, and then watered it:</i> (Et-Táïfee, TA:) or خَتَمَ الزَّرْعَ, (JK, K, TA,) aor.      <br>\

                  كِرَاب [app. meaning <i>clear of vegetation</i>].
