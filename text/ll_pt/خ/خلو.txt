      استخلى, (K.) [خَلَا المَكَانُ مِنَ <br>\
                  النَّاسُ وَ المَا=ءِ وَالكَلَا means <i>The place was,</i> or <i>became, devoid,</i> or <i>destitute, of human beings and water and herbage or pasturage; without human beings</i> &amp;amp;c.] Of a place of alighting or abode, you say, خَلَا مِنْ اَهْلِهِ and ↓ <br>\
      اخلى [<i>It was,</i> or <i>became, devoid,</i> or <i>destitute, of its occupants</i>]. (Msb.) And of a vessel, خَلَا مِمَّا فِيهِ <br>\
                  <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, empty of what was in it.</i> (Mgh.) And خَلَوْتُ <br>\

                  الاَمْرِ, and مِنْهُ, (Kudot;,) inf. n. خُلُوٌّ, <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, free</i> (Msb, K) <i>from fault,</i> (Msb,) or <i>from the thing,</i> or <i>affair:</i> (K:) and, accord. to IAar, خلا alone signifies <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, free from a fault,</i> or <i>the like, of which he was accused,</i> or <i>suspected.</i> (TA.) And خَلَتْ عَنْ مَانِعِ <br>\
                  النِّكَاحِ, inf. n. خُلُوٌّ, is said of a woman [as meaning <i>She was,</i> or <i>became, free from any obstacle to marriage</i>]. (Msb.) Accord. to the K, خَلَا مَكَانُهُ [lit. <i>His place became vacant</i>] means (tropical:)  <i>he died:</i> but accord. to IAar, خَلَا alone has this signification [from the same verb signifying مَضَى. explained below]: and if you add مكانه, you say خَلَّى, with teshdeed; which see below. (TA.) You say also, خَلَا لَكَ الشَّىْءُ and ↓ <br>\
      اخلى, both signifying the same, (AA, S, TA,) <i>i. q.</i> <br>\

      اخلى, (S, K,) said of a man, (TA,) or the same two verbs followed by بِنَفْسِهِ, said of a man, (Msb,) both signify the same; (S;) <i>He was,</i> or <i>became,</i> [<i>without any companion,</i> i. e.] <i>alone, by himself;</i> (Msb;) or <i>he became</i> (وَقَعَ [q. v.]) <i>in a vacant place, in which he was not pressed against,</i> or <i>straitened.</i> (K.) And خَلَا بِهِ, (S, Msb, K,) and اـِلَيْهِ, (S, K,) and مَعَهُ, (K,) inf. n. خَلْوَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and خَلَا=ءٌ (S, K) and خَلْوٌ, (K, TA,) or خُلُوٌّ, (CK,) or the first of these, i. e. خَلْوَةٌ, is a simple subst., and the second and third are the inf. ns.; (TA;) and به ↓ <br>\

      اخلاهُ, (S, K,) and بِهِ ↓ <br>\
      استخلى; (K; [the last omitted in the CK;]) <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, alone with him;</i> (Msb;) <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, in company with him,</i> or <i>he met him,</i> or <i>had a meeting or an interview with him, in a vacant place,</i> or <i>a place unoccupied</i> [<i>by others,</i> i. e., <i>in a private place</i>]. (S, K.) In the saying in the Kur [ii. 13], وَاـِذَا خَلَوْا اـِلَى <br>\
                  شَيَاطِينِهِمْ, it is said that اـِلَى is used in the sense of مَعَ, [so that the meaning is <i>And when they are alone with their devils,</i>] as in that other saying in the Kur [iii. 45 and lxi. 14], مَنْ اَنْصَارِى اـِلَى اْللّٰهُ. (S.) A man says to another man, اُخْلُ مَعِى حَتَّى <br>\
                  اُكَلِّمَكَ, i. e. <i>Be</i> [or <i>come</i>] <i>thou alone with me</i> [<i>that I may speak to thee</i> in private]. (TA.) And one says, خَلَا بِزَوْجَتِهِ, inf. n. خَلْوَةٌ, [but see what is said of this noun above,] <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, alone with his wife:</i> but [properly speaking, according to the law,] the term خَلْوَةٌ [or خَلْوَةٌ <br>\
                  صَحِيحَةٌ, in this case,] is not used unless it be <i>with the enjoyment of</i> <br>\
                  المُفَاخَذَة, [see 3 in art. فخذ,] and then it has an effect upon the circumstances of the marriage [by its rendering obligatory the payment of the dowry, though consummation has not taken place]: if with consummation, the act is termed دُخُولٌ. (Msb.) You say also, ↓ <br>\
      اَخْلِ <br>\
                  اَمْرَكَ and بِاَمْرِكَ <br>\
                  <i>Be thou alone in thine affair, with none to take part with thee in it; confine thyself to it exclusively of other things.</i> (TA. [See also 5.]) And اـِلَيْكَ ↓ <br>\
      اَخْلِ <br>\
                  <i>Keep thou to thine affair, and be alone in it, with none to take part with thee therein.</i> (JK.) And البُكَا=ءُ ↓ <br>\
      استخلى [app. for بِالبُكَا=ءِ] <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, alone in weeping, with none to participate with him in it.</i> (TA.) [And خَلَا لِلْاَمْرِ: see 5.] And خَلَاعَلَى <br>\
                  بَعْضِ الطَّعَامِ <br>\

                  اللَّبَنِ وَ اللَّحْمِ (JK, * TA) i. e. <i>Such a one fed upon milk and flesh-meat alone;</i> (JK;) or <i>such a one ate not, nor mixed, anything with milk and flesh-meat:</i> and Kináneh and Keys say ↓ <br>\
      اَخْلَى. (Lh, JK, * TA.) [And it seems to be indicated in the T that خَلَوْا signifies <i>They selected a she-camel for a</i> <br>\
                  خَلِيَّة, q. v.: or <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  تَخَلَّوْا بِخَلَيِّةٍ: see 5.] ―         -b3-  خَلَا also ssignifies <i>He devoted himself to religious services</i> or <i>exercises</i> [app. <i>in solitude,</i> or <i>seclusion,</i> or <i>in a</i> <br>\
                  خَلْوَة; or because one generally does so in solitude; or because the doing so involves abstraction from other affairs]. (TA. [See also 5; and see مُسْتَخْلٍ.]) ―         -b4-  And خَلَا بِهِ <br>\
                   [sometimes] signifies (tropical:)  <i>He mocked at, scoffed at, laughed at, derided,</i> or <i>ridiculed, him:</i> (Lh, S, Z, K, TA:) said by Az to be strange, and not known by him or any other authority than that of Lh: (TA:) from the saying, خَلَا فُلَانٌ بِعِرْضِ <br>\
                  فُلَانٍ يَعْبَثُ بِهِ [<i>Such a one occupied himself alone with the honour,</i> or <i>reputation, of such a one, making sport with it</i>]. (Ksh in ii. 13.) And <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  خَادَعَهُ (tropical:)  [<i>He deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented,</i> or <i>outwitted, him;</i> &amp;amp;c.: or <i>he strove to do so</i>]: (TA:) as also ↓ <br>\
      خالاهُ, (JK, and K in art. خلى,) inf. n. مُخَالَاةٌ. (JK.) ―         -b5-  And خَلَا عَلَيْهِ <br>\
                  <i>He relied upon him;</i> [as though he betook himself to him alone;] syn. اِعْتَمَدَ. (TA.) ―         -b6-  And خَلَا, (JK, K,) inf. n. خُلُوٌّ, (TA,) or خَلَا=ءٌ, (JK,) said of a man (JK) and of a thing, (JK, TA,) <i>He,</i> or <i>it, went, went away,</i> or <i>passed away.</i> (JK, K.) Hence, (TA,) وَ اـِنْ مِنْ اُمَّةٍاـِلَّا <br>\
                  خَلَا فِيهَا نَذِيرٌ, in the Kur [xxxv. 22], means [<i>And there is not any people but a warner</i>] <i>hath gone,</i> and <i>hath been sent, among them.</i> (S, TA.) [Hence also خَلَا explained above as meaning <i>He died.</i>] And خَلَا مِنْهَا [an elliptical phrase] <i>She became old; the greater part of her life passed.</i> (TA from a trad.) And خَلَاكَ ذَمٌّ [for خَلَا عَنْكَ <br>\
                  ذَمٌّ] <i>Blame passed away from thee;</i> or <i>may blame pass away from thee.</i> (Ksh and Bd in ii. 13.) You say, اِفْعَلْ كَذَا وَ خَلَاكَ ذَمٌّ <br>\
                  <i>Do thou such a thing, and thou wilt have an excuse;</i> [i. e.] <i>blame will fall from thee.</i> (S. [See art. ذم.]) And خَلَاهُ الحُزْنُ <br>\
                  <i>Grief passed away from him,</i> and <i>quitted him.</i> (Har p. 590, from the Tekmileh.) ―         -b7-  خَلَا عَنِ الشَّىْءِ: see 2.       -A2-  خَلَا [or خَلَى, probably belonging to art. خلى, though mentioned in the present art.,] <i>He ate what was good, sweet,</i> or <i>pleasant.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

(S.) ↓ It. also governs an accus. case, as a verb: (S, Mughnee:) so that you say, جَاوُونِى خَلَا زَيْدًا [meaning as above]; the agent of خلا being implied, (S, Mughnee, *) like that of حَاشَى [used as a verb]: it is as though you said, خَلَا مَنْ جَا=ءَنِى مِنْ زَيْدٍ [i. e. <i>those who came to me were without Zeyd</i>]: (S:) or correctly, accord. to IB, خَلَا بَعْضُهُمْ زَيْدًا [for مِنْ زَيْدٍ, like as you say, خَلَاكَ ذَمٌّ, for خَلَا <br>\
                  عَنْكَ ذَمٌّ]. (TA.) When you say مَا خَلَا, it is followed only by an accus., because ما خلا is equivalent to an inf. n.; (S, Mughnee;) so that when you say, جَاوُونِى مَا خَلَا زَيْدًا [meaning as above], it is as if you said, جَاوُونِى خُلُوَّ زَيْدٍ [or خُلُوًّا <br>\
                  زَيْدًا], i. e. خُلُوَّهُمْ مِنْ زَيْدٍ, (S,) which two phrases mean جَاوُونِى خَالِينَ مِنْ زَيْدٍ [<i>They came to me, they being without Zeyd</i>]: (S, K:) [for] accord. to Seer, ماخلا occupies the place of a noun in the accus. as a denotative of state: but some say, as an adv. n. of time; so that, accord. to these, مَا خَلَا زَيْدًا means وَقْتَ خُلُوِّهِمْ عَنْ زَيْدٍ [<i>in the time of their being without Zeyd</i>]. (Mughnee.) You say also, مَا اَرَدْتُ مَسَا=ءَتَكَ خَلَا اَنِّى وَعَظْتُكَ, meaning [<i>I desired not to displease thee,</i>] <i>but I admonished thee</i> (اـِلَّا اَنِّى وَعَظْتُكَ).
