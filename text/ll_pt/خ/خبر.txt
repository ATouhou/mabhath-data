      خِبْرٌ is syn. with مُخَابَرَةٌ: (S, K:) it is a forbidden practice: (A, Mgh, TA:) it is from خَبِيرٌ signifying “ a tiller, or cultivator, of land: ” (S, Mgh:) or from خَبَرَ “ he furrowed, or ploughed (land) for sowing; ” whence خَبِيرٌ also: (Msb:) or from خَبِرَتِ الاَرْضُ “ the land abounded with خَبَار: ” or from [the fortress of] خَيْبَر, because the Prophet made it to remain in the possession of its inhabitants for half of its revenue; and therefore it was said, خَابَرَهُمْ.
