(S, * K, * TA.) And [as an epithet] it is masc. and fem.; (S, K;) because it is originally an inf. n., the inf. n. of اَخْلَقُ meaning “ smooth, ” (S,) [or rather of خَلِقَ meaning “ it was, or became, old, and worn out; ” although it has pls.; and] IB mentions an instance of its dual, خَلَقَانِ: (TA:) Ks says, We have not heard them say, خَلَقَةٌ in any instance: (Lh, TA:) Fr says that it is without ة [as a fem. epithet] because it was originally used as a prefixed noun; for one said, اَعْطِنِى <br>\

                  اَخْلَاقٌ, meaning <i>A garment,</i> or <i>piece of cloth, altogether,</i> or <i>wholly, old and worn out;</i> (Fr, S, K;) every portion of it being خَلَق; (Fr;) like as they said بُرْمَةٌ اَعْشَارٌ &amp;amp;c.: (S:) and in like manner, مُلَا=ءَةٌ اَخْلَاقٌ. (IAar.) And Ks mentions the saying, اَصْبَحَتْ ثِيَابُهُمْ خُلْقَانًا وَ خَلَقُهُمْ جُدُدًا [<i>Their garments became old, and worn out; and their old and worn-out garments</i> became replaced by <i>new</i>]; with the sing.

      مِلْحَفَةٌ خُلَيْقٌ [<i>An outer wrapping garment that is a little,</i> or <i>somewhat, old, and worn out</i>], the dim. is without ة because it is [the dim. of] an epithet [applied without ة to a fem. n.], and ة is not affixed to the dims. of epithets [of this kind]: it is like نُصَيُفٌ dim. of نَصَفٌ an epithet applied to a woman.
