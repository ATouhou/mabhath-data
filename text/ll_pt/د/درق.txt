      دَرَقٌ, (S, K,) [or rather this is a coll. gen. n.,] and [the pl. is] اَدْرَاقٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and دِرَاقٌ; (K;) this last mentioned by IDrd, who says, they are <i>made of the skins of beasts found in the country of the Abyssinians,</i> (TA,) [as are shields thus called in the present day: they are <i>made of the skin of the hippopotamus,</i> and <i>of other pachydermatous animals;</i> and sometimes <i>of the skin of the crocodile; generally oval, with a large protuberance in the middle, behind which is the handle, and between a foot and a half and two feet in length.</i>]       -A2-  Also <i>A</i> <br>\

                  دُورَهْ,] arabicized: (L, TA:) [J says,] I think it to be Persian, arabicized: (S:) it is thus correctly written; not, as the context of the K requires it to be in this sense, دَرْدَقٌ.
