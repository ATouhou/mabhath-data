                  , (K,) inf. n. دَفْعٌ (Msb, K) and دَفَاعٌ (TA) and مَدْفَعٌ, (K,) [<i>He impelled it, pushed it, thrust it,</i> or <i>drove it;</i> and particularly, <i>so as to remove it from its place; he propelled it; he repelled,</i> or <i>repulsed, it; he pushed it, thrust it,</i> or <i>drove it, away,</i> or <i>back;</i>] <i>he put it away,</i> or <i>removed it from its place,</i> (Msb, TA,) <i>by,</i> or <i>with, force,</i> or <i>strength:</i> (TA:) or دَفْعٌ signifies the <i>putting away</i> or <i>removing</i> or <i>turning back</i> a thing <i>before the coming</i> or <i>arriving</i> [of that thing]; like as رَفْعٌ signifies the “ putting away or removing or turning back ” a thing “ after the coming or arriving ” thereof. (Kull p. 185.) Hence the saying in the Kur [ii. 252, and xxii. 41], وَلَوْ لَا دَفْعُ اْللّٰهِ النَّاسَ [<i>And were it not for God&#39;s repelling men</i>]; where some read ↓ <br>\
      دِفَاعُ [which means the same, as will be seen in the course of what follows, though bearing also another interpretation, likewise to be seen in what follows]. (TA.) You say, دَفَعْتُ <br>\
                  الرَّجُلَ [<i>I impelled, pushed,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>the man</i>]. (S.) And ↓ <br>\
      دافعهُ, inf. n. دِفَاعٌ [and مُدَافَعَةٌ]; and ↓ <br>\
      دفّعهُ; (TA;) [both, app., accord. to the TA, signifying the same; but the latter more properly relates to several objects together, or signifies <i>he impelled it, pushed it,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>much,</i> or <i>vehemently,</i> or <i>often;</i> whereas] مُدَافَعَةٌ (K, TA) and دِفَاعٌ (TA) are [often exactly] <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  دَفْعٌ. (K, TA.) Thus, (TA,) you say, as meaning the same, عَنْهُ ↓ <br>\
      دافع and دَفَعَ [<i>He repelled from him;</i> whence another explanation of these two phrases, which see in what follows]. (S, TA.) And hence, دَفَعَ اْللّٰهُ عَنْكَ المَكْرُوهَ, inf. n. دَفْعٌ, (tropical:)  [<i>May God repel,</i> or <i>avert, from thee what is disliked,</i> or <i>hated,</i> or <i>evil</i>]: (TA:) and اْللّٰهُ عَنْكَ السُّوْءَ ↓ <br>\
      دَافَعَ, inf. n. دِفَاعٌ, (tropical:)  [<i>May God repel,</i> or <i>avert, from thee evil</i>]. (S, TA.) And دَفَعْتُ عَنْهُ الاَذَى (tropical:)  [<i>I repelled,</i> or <i>averted, from him what was hurtful,</i> or <i>annoying;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      دَافَعْتُ]. (Msb, K, TA.) Sb mentions, as a saying of the Arabs, اِدْفَعِ الشَّرَّ <br>\
                  وَلَوْ اـِصْبَعًا (tropical:)  [<i>Repel thou,</i> or <i>avert thou, evil,</i> or <i>mischief, though but with a finger:</i> the last word being in the accus. case by reason of the subaudition of the prep. ب; the meaning being بِاـِصْبَعٍ]. (TA.) [See also an ex. voce دَفُوعٌ.] When دَفْعٌ is made trans. by means of عَنْ, [and has a single objective complement, a second objective complement is understood, and in general] it has the meaning or the act of (assumed tropical:)  <i>Defending;</i> as in the Kur [xxii. 39], اـِنَّ اْللّٰهَ يَدْفَعُ عَنْ اْلَّذِينَ ا=مَنُوا (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Verily God defendeth those who have believed;</i> i. e. <i>repelleth from them</i> aggression and the like]; (B;) and ↓ <br>\
      يُدَافِعُ, in the same, (K, TA,) accord. to another reading, signifies the same; (K, TA;) or this latter signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>defendeth energetically, with the energy of him who contendeth for superiority in so doing.</i> (Bd.) And عَنْهُ ↓ <br>\
      دَافَعْتُ signifies [also] (assumed tropical:)  <i>I pleaded,</i> or <i>contended in arguments, in defence of him.</i> (Msb.) [Exceptions to the statement cited above form the B will be found in what follows in this paragraph; and another exception, voce مُدَفَّعٌ.] ―         -b2-  [In the exs. which follow, the verb is used in senses little differing, essentially, from those assigned to it in the first sentence of this art.] ―         -b3-  دَفَعْتُ مِنَ الاـِنَا=ءِ <br>\
                  دَفَْعَةً [<i>I poured forth from the vessel a single pouring</i>]: the last word, which is with fet-h, is an inf. n. [of un.]. (Msb.) ―         -b4-  دَفَعَتِ اللِّبَاَفِى <br>\
                  ضَرْعِهَا قُبَيْلَ النِّتَاجِ (tropical:)  [<i>She</i> (a ewe, or goat, S, or a camel, S, K) <i>infused the first milk into her udder,</i> i. e. <i>secreted it therein, a little before bringing forth</i>]. (S, K.) And دَفَعَتِ اللَّبَنِ عَلَى <br>\
                  رَاْسِ وَلَدِهَا لِكَثْرَتِهِ (tropical:)  [<i>She</i> (a ewe or goat, or a camel, TA) <i>secreted the milk in her udder when about to produce her young, by reason of its abundance</i>]; for the milk becomes abundant in her udder only when she is about to bring forth: the inf. n. [app. the inf. n. of un.] is دَفْعَةٌ. (TA.) And دَفَعَتْ alone, said of a ewe or goat, signifies (assumed tropical:) <i>She secreted milk in her udder when about to produce the young;</i> expl. by اَضْرَعَتْ عَلَى رَاْسِ <br>\
                  الوَلَدِ [which see in art. ضرع]. (S, TA.) Accord. to En-Nadr, one says دَفَعَتْ بِلَبِنِهَا, and بِاللَّبَنِ, when her young is in her belly; but when she has brought forth, one does not say دَفَعَتْ. (TA.) ―         -b5-  In the saying, غَشِيِتْنَا سَحَابَةٌ فَدَفَعْنَاهَا اـِلَى غَيْرِنَا [lit. <i>A cloud overspread us, and we drove it away to other persons</i>], meaning (tropical:)  <i>it departed from us to other persons,</i> <br>\
                  دفعناها is for دَفَعَتْنَا, which means دُفِعَتْ عَنَّا [lit. <i>it was driven away from us</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b6-  دَفَعَهُ بِحُجَّةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He refelled him,</i> or <i>refuted him, by an argument</i> or <i>the like</i>]. (MF in art. كفح.) ―         -b7-  دَفَعْتُ القَوْلَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>I rebutted the saying; repelled it by an argument, an allegation,</i> or <i>a proof.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b8-  اِدْفَعْ هٰذَا (tropical:)  <i>Leave thou this, sparing him.</i> (As, TA.) [See مُدَفَّعٌ.] ―         -b9-  [In several exs. here following, the verb resembles اندفع; نَفْسَهُ, or the like, being understood after it.] ―         -b10-  دَفَعَ المَا=ءُ [<i>The water poured out,</i> or <i>forth, as though it impelled,</i> or <i>propelled, itself</i>]: (TA: [where it is followed by وَاْنْصَبَّ, as an explicative adjunct:]) and so السَّيْلُ [<i>the</i> <br>\
                  <i>torrent</i>]. (ISh.) [See also 6.] And دَفَعَ الوَادِى <br>\
                  بِالمَا=ءِ [<i>The valley poured with water</i>]. (TA in art. حشك.) ―         -b11-  دَفَعَ فِى عَدْوِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He pushed,</i> or <i>pressed, on,</i> or <i>forward, as though he impelled himself, in his running</i>]. (S in art. غور; &amp;amp;c.) [See also 7.] ―         -b12-  دَفَعَ القَوْمُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The people,</i> or <i>company of men, came at once.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b13-  دَفَعَ اـِلَى <br>\
                  المَكَانِ, (TA,) and دُفِعَ اـِلَيْهِ, (Msb, TA,) in the pass. form, (Msb,) (tropical:)  <i>He reached,</i> or <i>came to, the place.</i> (Msb, TA.) You say also, هٰذَا طَرِيقٌ يَدْفَعُ <br>\
                  اـِلَى مَكَانِ كَذَا (tropical:)  <i>This is a road which reaches to such a place.</i> (TA.) ―         -b14-  دَفَعَ مِنْ عَرَفَاتٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He commenced the journey from &#39;Arafát, and impelled and removed himself thence,</i> or <i>impelled his she-camel, and urged her to go.</i> (TA, from a trad.) And دَفَعْتُ عَنِ المَوْضِعِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>I removed, went, went away,</i> or <i>journeyed, from the place.</i> (Msb.) [See again 7.] ―         -b15-  دَفَعَ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>He returned.</i> (MF.) ―         -b16-  When دَفْعٌ is made trans. by means of اـِلَى, it [generally, but not always, as has been shown above,] has the meaning of the act of <i>Giving,</i> or <i>delivering;</i> as in the Kur [iv. 5], فَاْدْفَعُوا اـِلَيْهِمْ اَمْوَالَهُمْ [<i>Then give ye,</i> or <i>deliver ye, to them their property</i>]. (B.) You say, دَفَعْتُ <br>\
                  اـِلَىى فُلَانٍ شَيْيًا [<i>I gave,</i> or <i>delivered, to such a one a thing</i>]. (S, K. *) And دَفَعْتُ الوَدِيعَةَ اـِلَى صَاحِبِهَا <br>\
                  <i>I restored the deposit to its owner.</i> (Msb.) And دَفَعْتُ لَهُ قِطْعَةً مِنَ المَالِ [<i>I gave him a part,</i> or <i>portion, of the property</i>].
