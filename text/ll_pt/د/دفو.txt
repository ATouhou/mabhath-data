                  , [aor. يَدْفَى,] inf. n. دَفًا, <i>He,</i> or <i>it, was,</i> or <i>became, such as is termed</i> <br>\
                  اَدْفَى, <i>in any of the senses of this epithet.</i> (M.) [See also 4.]       -A2-  دَفَوْتُ الجَرِيحَ, (S, K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously, دَفَيْتُ,]) aor. اَدْفُوهُ, inf. n. دَفْوٌ; (S, TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      دَافَيْتُهُ and ↓ <br>\
      اَدْفَيْتُهُ; (A&#39;Obeyd, S, K;) <i>I despatched the wounded man;</i> i. e. <i>hastened and completed his slaughter;</i> or <i>made his slaughter sure,</i> or <i>certain:</i> (A&#39;Obeyd, S, K:) and so دَافَاْتُهُ and اَدْفَاْتُهُ (TA) [and دَافَقْتُهُ &amp;amp;c.: see 3 in art. دف]. Accord. to Ibn-Abi-l-Hadeed, دَفَى, [or rather دَفَا,] sometimes pronounced with ء, [دَفَاَ,] signifies <i>He slew,</i> in the dial. of Kináneh. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                     اَدْفَوَ<br>\
                   see 1.       -A2-  It is related in a trad. that a captive was brought to the Prophet, (S, TA,) shivering by reason of cold, (TA,) and he said to some persons, اِذْهَبُوا بِهِ فَاَدْفُوهُ, meaning [<i>Take ye him away and</i>] <i>clothe him so as to protect him from the cold;</i> (S, TA;) for اَدْفِيُوهُ; because the pronunciation of ء was not of the dial. of Kureysh; but they thought that he meant slaughter; (TA;) and they took him away and slew him: therefore he paid the fine for his blood. (S, TA.) As is said in the K, اَدْفَيْتُ is a dial. var. of اَدْفَاْتُ. (TA.)       -A3-  ادفى said of a gazelle, <i>His horns were,</i> or <i>became, so long as almost to reach his hinder part.</i> (T, K.) [See also دَفِىَ.]    </entryFree> <br>\

                  مُتَجَافِيًا [<i>The camel went along with an inclining from side to side</i>]. (S.) [See also the second of the verses cited in the first paragraph of art. دف: from the explanation of which by ISd, it appears that تَدَافَى is perhaps originally تَدَافَّ.]    </entryFree> <br>\
