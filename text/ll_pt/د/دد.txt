                  , (S, A, K, [but in some copies of the S and K written دَدّ, and said in the TA, in art ددن, to be so written by some, though it is there implied that this is of doubtful authority,]) without tesh-deed, (A, TA,) like يَدٌ, (MF,) <i>Diversion, sport, play,</i> or <i>such as is vain,</i> or <i>frivolous;</i> (S, A, K;) as also دَدًا, like قَفًا; and دَدنٌ, (S, K,) and ↓ <br>\
      دَدَدٌ: (Ed-Demámeenee, CK:) but accord. to IB, it should be mentioned in art. ددن [in which دَدَنٌ is mentioned again in the S and K], or art. ددو [in which دَدًا is mentioned again together with دَدٌ and دَدَنٌ]. (L.) [The proper place of دَدٌ seems to be art. ددو (like as art. اخو is the proper place in which اَخٌ should be mentioned), as well as of دَدًا; and the proper place of دَدَنٌ, art. ددن.] Hence, (A,) مَا اَنَا مِنْ دَدٍ وَلَا الدَّدُ مِنِّى [<i>I have no concern with diversion,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>nor has diversion,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>any concern with me</i>]: a saying [of Mohammad] occurring in a trad. (S, A.)       -A2-  Also <i>A space</i> (حِينٌ) <i>of time.</i> (K.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   [meaning <i>Diverting himself, sporting, playing,</i> or <i>doing so in a vain,</i> or <i>frivolous, manner,</i>] occurs [accord. to one reading] in a verse of Et- Tirimmáh [cited in this art. in the K, and in the present work in art. طرب, as an ex. of اِسْتَطْرَبَ]: the poet has annexed to it a third د because an epithet is not susceptible of variation unless comprising three letters: (K:) or such is the opinion of F; but this requires consideration.
