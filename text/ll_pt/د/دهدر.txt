<b>دُهْدُرٌّ</b>               1     <br>\
                     دُهْدُرٌّ<br>\
                     دهدر<br>\
                   a noun signifying <i>What is false,</i> or <i>vain; a lie;</i> syn. بَاطِلٌ and كَذِبٌ: as also دُهْدُرَّيْنِ, (K,) its dual, (TA,) or دُهْ دُرَّيْنِ, or دُهْ دُرَّيْنْ: (as in different copies of the S:) whence دُهْدُرَّيْنِ and ↓ <br>\
      دُهْدُرِّيَّةٌ are epithets applied to <i>a liar;</i> or <i>a great</i> or <i>habitual liar:</i> and accord. to AZ, the Arabs used to say, دُهْدُرَّانِ لَا يُغْنِياَنِ عَنْكَ شَيْيًا [<i>Lies will not avail thee aught</i>]: and دُهْدُنٌّ signifies the same as دُهْدُرٌّ. (TA.) ―         -b2-  دُهْدُرَّيْنِ is also a noun, (K,) i. e. a verbal noun, (TA,) signifying <i>He was,</i> or <i>has become, unoccupied,</i> or <i>without work;</i> syn. بَطَلَ; (K;) like سَرْعَانَ for سَرُعَ, and هَيْهَاتِ for بَعُدَ. (TA.) Hence the prov., (TA,) دُهْدُرَّيْنِ سَعْدُ القَيْنِ, (As, K,) without the conjunction وَ [after the first word], and دهدرّين being written as one word, (TA,) meaning <i>Saad the blacksmith became,</i> or <i>has become, unoccupied,</i> or <i>without work;</i> not being employed because of the people&#39;s being diverted from other things by drought (As, K) and distress. (TA.) Some say سَاعدُ القَيْنِ: and Aboo-&#39;Obeydeh Maamar Ibn-El-Muthennà relates it thus: دهدرّين <br>\
                  سَعْدَ القَيْن, with سعد in the accus. case, and says that دهدرّين is governed in the accus. case by a verb understood; apparently meaning that it is a noun signifying البَاطِلُ, dual of دُهْدُرٌّ, not a verbal noun, as though the prov. meant <i>Cast ye away what is false,</i> or <i>vain, and Saad the blacksmith:</i> but what he says is not correct. (TA.) Or a certain blacksmith asserted his name to be Saad  for some time, and then his lying became manifest; so this was said to him; meaning, <i>Thou hast added falsehood to falsehood, O Saad the blacksmith.</i> (K.) It is also related separately; (K;) and so J and others relate it; saying ده <br>\
                  درّين: (TA:) [in one copy of the S, I find it written دُهْ دُرَّيْنْ: in another, دُهْ دُرَّيْنِ:] دُهْ being an imperative from الدَّهَا=ءُ; its final radical letter being transposed to the place of the medial, so that it becomes دُوْهْ, and the و being then rejected because of the two quiescent letters, (K,) so that it becomes دُهْ, like as is done in the case of قُلْ: (TA:) and دُرَّيْنِ being from دَرَّ, “ it was consecutive; ” (K;) by the dual form being meant repetition, as in the case of لَبَّيْكَ &amp;amp;c.: (TA:) so that the meaning is <i>Be thou very lying</i> (K) <i>and cunning,</i> (TA,) <i>O Saad</i> (K) <i>the blacksmith:</i> (TA:) and this explanation, says IB, is good, except inasmuch as that the د in درّين thus derived should be with fet-h; or, he adds, it may be with damm to assimilate it to the د in دُهْ [like as القَيْنِ is terminated with kesr to assimilate it to دُرَّيْنِ]. (TA.) Or the origin of the saying was this: Saad the blacksmith was a Persian, who went about the districts of ElYemen, working for the people; and when he became without work in a district, he used to say, in Persian, دِهْ بَدْرُودْ: [so in a copy of the S; and this, or دِهْ بِدْرُودْ, is the correct reading: in another copy of the S, دَهْ بَدُورُدْ: and in the copies of the K, دِهْ بَدْرُودْ:] (S, K:*) meaning, [<i>O town, or village,</i>] <i>farewell:</i> to acquaint them that he was going forth on the morrow: (K:) or meaning I am going forth to-morrow: (S:) in order that he might be employed: and they arabicized the expression, and made him the subject of a prov. with respect to lying; and said, When ye hear of the blacksmith&#39;s departure at night, he is assuredly coming in the morning. (S, K.) Some say that the prov. is elliptical, for بَطَلَ قَوْلُ سَعْدٍ الخ [<i>False is the saying of Saad</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (TA.) [This is mentioned in the S in art. در.]    </entryFree> <br>\
