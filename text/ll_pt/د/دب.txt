It is said to be a beast sixty cubits in length, or height, with legs, and with fur (وَبَر), and to be diverse in form, resembling a number of different animals. (TA.) It will come forth in Tihámeh, or between Es-Safà and ElMarweh, (M,) or at Mekkeh, from Jebel Es- Safà, which will rend open for its egress, during one of the nights when people are going to Minè; or from the district of Et-Táïf; (K) or from three places, three several times. (M, K.) It will make, upon the face of the unbeliever, a black mark; and upon the face of the believer, a white mark: the unbeliever&#39;s mark will spread until his whole face becomes black; and the believer&#39;s, until his whole face becomes white: then they will assemble at the table, and the believer will be known from the unbeliever. (M.) It is also said that it will have with it the rod of Moses and the seal of Solomon: with the former it will strike the believer; and with the latter it will stamp the face of the unbeliever, impressing upon it “ This is an unbeliever. ” (K.) ―         -b3-  See also اَرَضَةٌ.    </entryFree> <br>\
