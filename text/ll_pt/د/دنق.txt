                  , (S, Mgh, TA,) inf. n. تَدْنِيقٌ, (Mgh, K,) <i>He went to the utmost point</i> [<i>in his dealings</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (S, K, TA:) <i>he was minute, observant of small things, nice,</i> or <i>scrupulous:</i> (Mgh:) <i>he examined minutely into his dealings and expenses.</i> (So accord. to an explanation of the act. part. n. in the TA.) Hence the saying, لَا تُدَنَّقُوا فَيُدَنَّقَ <br>\
                  عَلَيْكُمْ [<i>Go not ye to the utmost point</i> against others, <i>for in that case the utmost point may be gone to against you</i>]. (S, TA.) And the saying of El-Hasan, (Mgh, TA,) لَعَنَ اْللّٰهُ الدَّانَقَ وَ مَنْ <br>\

                  دانَق], meaning El-Hajjáj. (Mgh.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] تَدْنِيقٌ, metonymically, signifies (tropical:)  The <i>being niggardly, stingy,</i> or <i>avaricious.</i> (Az, TA.) ―         -b3-  Also The <i>continuing to look at a thing;</i> (S, K;) as also تَرْنِيقٌ: [or rather each has this signification elliptically; for] you say, دنّق اـِلَيْهِ النَّظَرَ and رنّق [meaning <i>He continued looking at it</i>]. (S.) [See رَنَّقَ.] And in like manner, The <i>looking weakly.</i> (S, TA.) And دنّق بَصَرَهُ <br>\

You say, دنّقت الشَّمْسُ (tropical:)  <i>The sun became near to setting.</i> (JK, TA.
