      دمّغهُ signifies (tropical:)  <i>He overcame him,</i> or <i>prevailed over him, much, so as to subdue him,</i> or <i>abase him.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  [Hence, app.,] دُمِغَتِ الاَرْضُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>The produce of</i>] <i>the land was eaten.</i> (IAar, TA.) ―         -b4-  And دَمَغَهُمْ بِمُطْفَيَةِ الرَّضْفِ (tropical:)  <i>He slaughtered for them a lean sheep</i> or <i>goat:</i> (K:) so says Lh, except that he does not explain the verb, which is thus explained by Ibn-&#39;Abbád and Z: (TA:) or, as some say, <i>a fat sheep</i> or <i>goat.</i> (K.)       -A2-  دمغت حَوِيَّتَهَا, [the verb written in the L and TA without teshdeed, so that it is app. دَمَغَتْ, but it may be ↓ <br>\

                     دماغ<br>\
                   a word of which the signification is well known; (S, Msb;) [<i>The brain;</i>] <i>the marrow of the head;</i> (K;) or <i>the stuffing of the head:</i> (TA:) or [app. a mistake for “and” (<i>what is termed</i>)] اُمُّ الهَامِ or اُمُّ الرَّاْسِ or [in one copy of the K “and”] اُمُّ الدِّمَاغِ is <i>a thin skin, like a pouch, in which it is contained:</i> (K:) [these three terms, امّ الهام and امّ الراس and امّ <br>\
                  الدماغ, appear all to signify <i>the meninx;</i> (see اُمٌّ;) but the first and second of them seem to have been mistaken by the author or transcribers of the K for different explanations of الدَّمَاغُ:] the pl. [of pauc.] is اَدْمِغَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and [of mult.] دُمُغٌ. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  دِمَاغ [or <i>brain</i>]: (IDrd, K:) the former is likewise applied to a woman: and the pl., applied to men and to women, is دَمْغَى. (IDrd, TA.) ―         -b2-  Also, both words, (assumed tropical:)  <i>Stupid; foolish;</i> or <i>unsound,</i> or <i>dull,</i> or <i>deficient, in intellect:</i> ↓ <br>\
      مُدَمَّغٌ is incorrectly used by the vulgar in this sense; (K, TA;) as though meaning <i>overcome, so as to be subdued,</i> or <i>abased, by the devil:</i> it is said in the “Námoos” that this last word may be correct as having an intensive signification; but it may admit of such a signification, and yet may be incorrect, not heard from persons of chaste speech.

(TA.) [See شَجَّةٌ دَامِعَةٌ, voce دَامِعٌ. Several other terms are mentioned in the TA; but these, which will be found in their proper arts., appear to be all syn. with some that are mentioned above.

                  <i>being fastened upon the heads of the cross-pieces, in order that it,</i> or <i>they, may not become disconnected.</i> (TA.) [What it is, I am unable further to explain. It is perhaps thus called because so placed that a person is liable to have his head wounded by it.] ―         -b4-  And <i>A piece of wood placed across between two poles, upon which is hung the skin for water</i> or <i>milk.</i> (JK, Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)    </entryFree> <br>\
