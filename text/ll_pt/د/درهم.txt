                  , (S, K,) inf. n. اِدْرِهْمَامٌ, (S,) <i>He</i> (a man, TA) <i>became aged:</i> (K, TA:) or <i>he</i> (an old man) <i>tottered</i> (سَقَطَ) <i>by reason of age.</i> (S, TA.) ―         -b2-  ادرهمّ بَصَرَهُ <br>\

<b>دِرْهَمٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     دِرْهَمٌ<br>\
                     در<br>\
                     درهم<br>\
                  , (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) of the measure فِعْلَلٌ, (Msb, MF,) of which it has been said that there are only three other instances, but there are many more; (MF;) an arabicized word, (S, Msb,) from the Pers. [دِرَمْ]; (S;) also pronounced ↓ <br>\
      دِرْهِمٌ, (S, Msb, K,) but this is of rare occurrence; (TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      دِرْهَامٌ, (S, K,) which is more rare; (TA;) <i>A certain silver coin;</i> (Mgh, Msb;) like as دِينَارٌ signifies a certain gold coin: (Mgh:) [and the <i>weight thereof;</i> i. e. <i>a drachm,</i> or <i>dram:</i>] <i>its weight is six</i> <br>\
                  دَوَانِيق [or <i>dániks</i>]; (Msb, and K in art. مك;) i. e., <i>the weight of the</i> <br>\
                  دِرْهَم اـِسْلَامِىّ: but in the Time of Ignorance, some dirhems were light, being <i>four</i> <br>\
                  دوانيق; and these were called طَبَرِيَّةٌ: and some were heavy, being <i>eight</i> <br>\
                  دوانيق; and these were called عَبْدِيَّةٌ, or بَغْلِيَّةٌ: and of these two they made two that were equal; so that each درهم was <i>six</i> <br>\
                  دوانيق: this is said to have been done by &#39;Omar: or, accord. to another account, some dirhems were of the weight of <i>twenty carats,</i> and were called the <i>weight of ten</i> [i. e. of ten <i>dániks</i>]; and some were of the weight of <i>ten</i> [<i>carats</i>], and were called the <i>weight of five;</i> and some were of the weight of <i>twelve</i> [<i>carats</i>], and were called the <i>weight of six;</i> and they put the three weights together, and called the third part thereof the <i>weight of seven:</i> and one of the weights of the درهم before El-Islám was <i>twelve carats,</i> which is <i>six</i> <br>\
                  دوانيق: but the درهم اسلامىّ is <i>sixteen carats;</i> the دانق of this being a carat and two thirds: (Msb:) or dirhems should be <i>fourteen carats</i> [i. e. <i>seven dániks</i>]; ten being of the weight of seven مَثَاقِيل [or mithkáls]: in the Time of Ignorance, some were heavy, [equal to] مثاقيل; and some were light, [called] طَبَرِيَّةٌ; and when they were coined in the age of El-Islám, they made of the heavy and the light two dirhems, so that ten became equal to seven مثاقيل: A &#39;Obeyd says that this was done in the time [of the dynasty] of the sons of Umeiyeh: (El-Karkhee, cited in the Mgh:) [see also De Sacy&#39;s “ Chrest. Arabe, ” sec. ed., vol. ii. p. 110 of the Arabic text, and p. 282 of the transl.; where it is further stated, on the authority of Ibn-Khaldoon, that the دِرْهَم مَغْرِبِىّ was <i>three</i> <br>\
                  دوانيق; and the يَمَنِىّ, <i>one</i> <br>\
                  دانق; and, as is said in the Msb, that &#39;Omar adopted the mean between the بغلىّ and the طبرىّ, making the درهم to be <i>six:</i>] the pl. (of درهم, S) is دَرَاهِمُ and (of درهام, S) دَرَاهِيمُ. (S, K.) [The former of these pls. is often used as signifying <i>Money, cash,</i> or <i>coin,</i> in an absolute sense.] The dim. is ↓ <br>\
      دُرَيْهِمٌ and ↓ <br>\
      دُرَيْهِيمٌ: the latter held by Sb to be anomalous; for he says that it is as though it were formed from دِرْهَامٌ, though this was not used by them. (TA.) ―         -b2-  Hence, as being likened thereto, [i. e., to the coin thus called,] (TA,) دِرْهَمٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  <i>A</i> <br>\
                  حَدِيقَة [app. as meaning a <i>round piece of land surrounded by a fence or the like,</i> or <i>by elevated land;</i> for this is one of the significations of حَدِيقَةٌ]. (K.) [It is said that] this is taken from  the saying of &#39;Antarah, [describing shower of copious rain,] <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        فَتَرَكْنَ كُلَّ حَدِيقَةٍ كَالدِّرْهَمِ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>So that they left every ridged-round spot of ground like the</i> <br>\
                  درهم]. (TA.) [But accord. to one reading, he said, كُلَّ قَرَارَةٍ; meaning, as is said in the EM, p. 227, “ every round hollow; ” and likening such a hollow to the درهم because of its roundness, and the clearness and whiteness of its water.]    </entryFree> <br>\
