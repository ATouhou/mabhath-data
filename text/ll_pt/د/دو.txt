                  <i>He went away into the country,</i> or <i>in the land.</i> (T.) Ru-beh uses the phrase دوّى بِهَا as signifying <i>He passed by them;</i> meaning, by them, a male [wild] ass and his she-asses. (T.) And it is said of the دَوِّيَّة that it is thus called لِاَنَّهَا تُدَوِّى صَارَ فِيهَا, i. e. <i>Because it makes away with those who are in it.</i> (T.)       -A2-  See also art. دوى.    </entryFree> <br>\
