      استدام signifies the same as دام [in all of these senses]: (TA:) [but Mtr says,] استدام السَّفَرُ [<i>The journey continued,</i> or <i>continued long,</i>] is not of established authority. (Mgh.) [Hence, دَامَ مُلْكُهُ <br>\

      داومهُ, as is shown by a usage of the act. part. n. in art. دمن in the S, &amp;amp;c.,] (S, * MA,) inf. n. مُدَاوَمَةٌ; (S;) <i>He kept continually,</i> or <i>constantly, to the thing,</i> or <i>affair.</i> (S, MA.) مَا دَامَ means <i>Continuance;</i> because ما is a conjunct noun to دام; and it is not used otherwise than adverbially, like as inf. ns. are used adverbially: you say, لَا اَجْلِسُ مَا دُمْتَ قَايِمًا, i. e., دَوَامَ قِيَامِكَ [<i>I will not sit during the continuance of thy standing</i>]; (S, TA;) [or <i>as long as thou standest;</i> or <i>while thou standest;</i> for] ما denotes <i>time;</i> and قُمْ مَا دَامَ زَيْدٌ قَايِمًا means مُدَّةَ قِيَامِ زَيْدٍ [i. e. <i>Stand thou during the period of Zeyd&#39;s standing</i>]. (Ibn-Keysán, TA.) [And عَلَىالدَّوَامِ means <i>Continually,</i> or <i>constantly;</i> like دَايِمًا.] ―         -b2-  Said of rain, it means <i>It fell,</i> or <i>descended, consecutively, continuously,</i> or <i>constantly.</i> (Msb.) Some say, (M,) دَامَتِ السَّمَا=ءُ, aor. تَدِيمٌ, inf. n. دَيْمٌ, (M, K,) which, if correct, should be included in art. ديم, (M,) meaning <i>The sky rained continually;</i> as also ↓ <br>\

(M, TA.) ―         -b3-  دوّم said of a bird, (T, M, K,) inf. n. تَدْوِيمٌ, (T, S,) (tropical:)  <i>It circled</i> (Lth, T, S, M, K, TA) <i>in the sky,</i> (Lth, T, M, K,) as also ↓ <br>\

[See also 1, near the end of the paragraph.]) Dhu-r-Rummeh makes التَّدْوِيم to be on the earth, or ground, in the verse cited above in this paragraph; [as though the meaning were, (assumed tropical:)  <i>Until, when they went round</i> &amp;amp;c.;] As disallows this, and asserts that one says only دَوَّى فِىالاَرْضِ, and دَوَّمَ فِى السَّمَا=ءِ; but some affirm that التَّدْوِيمُ <br>\
                  فِىالاَرْضِ is correct; and say that hence is de rived ↓ <br>\
      الدُّوَّامَةُ, meaning “ the round thing [or top] which the boy throws, and makes to revolve, or spin, upon the ground, by means of a string; ” though others say that this is so called from the phrase دَوَّمْتُ القِدْرَ [explained below], because, by reason of the quickness of its revolving, or spinning, it seems as though it were at rest: and تَدْوَامٌ is like تَدْوِيمٌ: some, however, say that تَدْوِيمُ الكَلْبِ signifies <i>the dog&#39;s going far in flight:</i> (S:) AHeyth says that, accord. to As, التَّدْوِيمُ is only the act of a bird in the sky: (T, TA:) AAF says that, accord. to some, التَّدْوِيمُ is in the sky, and التَّدْوِيَةُ is on the earth, or ground; but accord. to others, the reverse is the case; and this, he says, is the truth in his opinion. (M, TA. [See also دَوَّىَ in art. دوى.]) ―         -b4-  You say also, دَوَّمَتِ, الشَّمْسُ, (M, K,) or دوّمت الشمس فى السَّمَاءِ, (T,) or فِىكَبِدِ السَّمَا=ءِ, (S,) i. e. دَارَتْ فِى السَّمَا=ءِ [or دارت فى كبد السماء, lit.

      دُوَّامَةٌ applied to the boy&#39;s revolving, or spinning, thing. (T.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says, (describing the [insect called] جُنْدَب, [generally said to be a species of locust,] TA in art. رمض) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
