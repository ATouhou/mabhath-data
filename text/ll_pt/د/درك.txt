      اِدَّرَكَهُ. (TA.) You say, اَدْرَكْتُ الرَّجُلَ and ↓ <br>\
      اِدَّرَكْتُهُ [<i>I attained, reached, overtook,</i> or <i>came up with, the man</i>]. (IJ, TA.) And مَشَيْتُ حَتَّى اَدْرَكْتُهُ <br>\
                  <i>I walked,</i> or <i>went on foot, until I overtook him,</i> or <i>came up with him.</i> (S, TA.) And عِشْتُ حَتَّى اَدْرَكْتُ زَمَانَهُ <br>\

And ادركهُ بِمَكْرُوهٍ [<i>He overtook him,</i> or <i>visited him, with some displeasing,</i> or <i>abominable,</i> or <i>evil, action</i>]. (M and K in art. وتر. See also 6, in the latter half of the paragraph, in two places: and see 10, first sentence.) And اَدْرَكَنِى الجَهْدُ [<i>Difficulty,</i> or <i>distress,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>overtook me, ensued to me,</i> or <i>came upon me</i>]; a phrase similar to بَلَغَنِى <br>\
                  الكِبَرُ in the Kur [iii. 35]: and so اَدْرَكْتُ الجَهْدَ [<i>I came to experience difficulty,</i> &amp;amp;c.]; like بَلَغْتُ <br>\
                  مِنَ الكِبَرِ عُتِيًا in the Kur [xix. 9]. (Er-Rághib, TA in art. بلغ.) ―         -b2-  [Hence, <i>He attained, obtained,</i> or <i>acquired, it;</i> and so ↓ <br>\
      تداركهُ, as is shown in the KL; so too ادرك بِهِ, for one says,] ادرك بِدَمِهِ [<i>He obtained revenge,</i> or <i>retaliation, for his blood</i>]. (S in art. وتر.) ―         -b3-  [Hence also, <i>He perceived it; attained a knowledge of it by any of the senses.</i>] You say, اَدْرَكْتُهُ بِبَصَرِى [<i>I perceived it by my sight;</i>] <i>I saw it.</i> (S, TA.) لَا تُدْرِكُهُ الاَبْصَارُ, in the Kur [vi. 103], means, accord. to some, <i>The eyes</i> [<i>perceive him not</i>]: accord. to others, <i>the mental perception comprehendeth not</i> [or <i>attaineth not the knowledge of</i>] <i>the real nature of his hallowed essence.</i> (TA.) You say also, ادرك عِلْمِى, meaning <i>My knowledge comprehended</i> that such a thing was a fact. (TA.) ―         -b4-  [Hence likewise, as an intrans. v., or a trans. v. of which the objective complement is understood,] ادرك also signifies [<i>He attained a knowledge of the uttermost of a thing;</i> or] <i>his knowledge attained the uttermost of a thing.</i> (TA.) See also 6, in the former half of the paragraph, in two places. ―         -b5-  Also <i>It</i> (a thing) <i>attained its proper time:</i> (Msb, K:) <i>it attained its final time</i> or <i>state,</i> or <i>its utmost point</i> or <i>degree.</i> (K.) [<i>He</i> (a boy, and a beast,) <i>attained his perfect, ripe,</i> or <i>mature, state;</i> and in like manner ادركت is said of a girl: or it is like ادرك as meaning] <i>he</i> (a boy) <i>attained to puberty,</i> (S, Msb,) or <i>to the utmost term of youth.</i> (TA.) <i>It</i> (fruit) <i>attained to ripeness,</i> or <i>maturity; became ripe,</i> or <i>mature;</i> (S Msb;) <i>attained its time, and its utmost degree of ripeness</i> or <i>maturity.</i> (T, TA.) And ادركت القِدْرُ <br>\
                  <i>The cooking-pot attained its proper time</i> [<i>for the cooking of its contents</i>]. (TA.) And ادركت الخَمْرُ [<i>The wine became mature</i>]. (Msb and K in art. خمر.) And ادرك مَا=ءُ الرَّكِيَّةِ <br>\

                  دَرَك, i. e. its <i>bottom</i> (Aboo-&#39; Adnán, TA.) ―         -b6-  Also <i>It passed away and came to an end; came to nought; became exhausted;</i> or <i>failed entirely:</i> (S, K:) said in this sense of flour, or meal: (S:) and thus it has been explained as used in the Kur [xxvii. 68], where it is said, [accord. to one reading,] بَلْ اَدْرَكَ عِلْمُهُمْ فِى الا=خِرَةِ [<i>Nay, their knowledge hath entirely failed respecting the world to come</i>]. (TA. [See also 6.]) Sh mentions this signification as heard by him on no other authority than that of Lth; and Az asserts it to be incorrect: but it has been authorized by more than one of the leading lexicologists, and the language of the Arabs does not forbid it; for it is said of flour, or meal, and in this case can only mean <i>it came to its end, and entirely failed,</i> or <i>became exhausted;</i> and fruits, when they are ripe (اـِذَا اَدْرَكْتْ) are exposed to coming to nought, and so is everything that has attained to its extreme term; so that the signification of “ coming to nought ” is one of the necessary adjuncts of the meaning of اـِدْرَاكٌ. (TA.) [In like manner,] ↓ <br>\
      اِدَّرَكَ signifies <i>It</i> (a thing) <i>continued uninterruptedly and then come to nought:</i> (IJ, TA:) and agreeably with this signification is explained the saying in the Kur [xxvi. 61], اـِنَّا لَمُدَّرِكُونَ [<i>Verily we are coming to nought,</i> by those who read thus instead of لَمُدْرَكُونَ <br>\
                  <i>being overtaken</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b7-  You say also, ادرك الثَّمَنُ <br>\
                  المُشْتَرِىَ, meaning [The payment of] <i>the price was,</i> or <i>became, obligatory on the purchaser:</i> this is an ideal reaching, or overtaking. (Msb.)    </entryFree> <br>\

      اِدَّرَكُوا; (Sh, TA;) [or] <i>the last of them attained, reached, overtook,</i> or <i>came up with, the first of them.</i> (S Msb, K, TA.) Hence, in the Kur [vii. 36], (S,) حَتَّى اـِذَا اْدَّارَكُوا فِيهَا جَمِيعًا [<i>Until, when they have overtaken one another,</i> or <i>have successively arrived, therein, all together</i>]: originally تَدَارَكُوا. (S, K. *) And تدارك الثَّرِيَانَ [<i>The two moistures reached each other;</i> (like اِلْتَقَى الثَّرَيَانِ;) meaning] <i>the moisture of the rain reached the moisture of the earth.</i> (S.) ―         -b2-  And [hence] تدارك signifies [<i>It continued,</i> or <i>was carried on, uninterruptedly; it was closely consecutive in its parts,</i> or <i>portions;</i>] <i>one part,</i> or <i>portion, of it, followed,</i> or <i>was made to follow, another uninterruptedly;</i> said of anything. (TA.) You say, تدارك السَّيْرُ [<i>The course,</i> or <i>pace,</i> or <i>journeying, continued uninterruptedly</i>]. (S and TA in art. حفد, &amp;amp;c.) And تداركت الاَخْبَارُ <br>\
                  <i>The tidings followed one another closely.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  [Hence, when said of knowledge, meaning, accord. to Fr, <i>It continued unbroken in its sequence</i> or <i>concatenation.</i>] بَلِ اْدَّرَاكَ عِلْمُهُمْ فِى الا=خِرَةِ (K, TA,) in the Kur [xxvii. 68], (TA,) [virtually] means <i>Nay, they have no knowledge respecting the world to come:</i> (K, TA:) or, as IJ says, <i>their knowledge is hasty, and slight, and not on a sure footing,</i> &amp;amp;c.: Az says that AA read بَلْ اَدْرَكَ [of which an explanation has been given above (see 4)]: that I&#39;Ab is related to have read ↓ <br>\
      بَلَىا=اَدْرَكَ [&amp;amp;c., i. e. <i>Yea, hath their knowledge reached its end</i> &amp;amp;c.?], as interrogatory, and without tesh-deed: and that, accord. to the reading بل ادّراك Fr says that the proper meaning is, [<i>Nay,</i>] <i>hath their knowledge continued unbroken so as to extend to the knowledge of the world to come,</i> whether it will be or not be? wherefore is added, بَلْ هُمْ فِى شَكٍّ مِنْهَا بَلْ هُمْ مِنْهَا عَمُونَ: he says also that Ubeí read, اَمْ تَدَارَكَ; and that the Arabs substitute بَلْ for اَمْ, and اَمْ for بَلْ, when a passage begins with an interrogation: but this explanation of Fr is not clear; the meaning is [said to be] <i>their knowledge shall be unbroken and concurrent</i> [<i>respecting the world to come</i>] when the resurrection shall have become a manifest event, and they shall have found themselves  to be losers; and the truth of that wherewith they have been threatened shall appear to them when their knowledge thereof will not profit them: accord. to Aboo-Mo&#39;ádh the Grammarian, the readings ↓ <br>\
      بَلْ اَدْرَكَ &amp;amp;c. and بَلِ اْدَّارَكَ &amp;amp;c. mean the same; i. e. <i>they shall know in the world to come;</i> like the saying in the Kur [xix. 39], اَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَاَبْصِرْ, &amp;amp;c.: and Es-Suddee says of both these readings that the meaning is, <i>their knowledge shall agree,</i> or <i>be in unison, in the world to come;</i> i. e. they shall know in the world to come that that wherewith they have been threatened is true: or, accord. to Mujáhid, the meaning of بَلِ اْدَّارَكَ عِلْمُهُمْ &amp;amp;c. is said to be, <i>is their knowledge concurrent respecting the world to come?</i> <br>\
                  بل being here used in the sense of اَم: (TA:) or it may mean <i>their knowledge hath gone on uninterruptedly until it hath become cut short;</i> from the phrase تدارك بَنُو فُلَانٍ meaning <i>The sons of such a one went on uninterruptedly into destruction.</i> (Bd.)       -A2-  تداركهُ: see 4, in two places. It is used in the [primary] sense of اَدْرَكَهُ in the saying in the Kur [lxviii. 49], لَوْ لَا اَنْ تَدارَكَهُ <br>\

[The verse there commences with اَنَا; but اَنَ is required by the metre, and is more approved in every case except the case of a pause.]) It is mostly used in relation to aid, or relief, and benefaction: [so that it signifies <i>He aided,</i> or <i>relieved, him; he benefited him; he repaired his,</i> or <i>its, condition; he repaired, amended, corrected,</i> or <i>rectified, it:</i>] whence the saying of a poet, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
