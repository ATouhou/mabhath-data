Accord. to Fr, ثُمَّ دَنَا فَتَدَلَّى [in the Kur liii. 8] means ثَمَّ تَدَلَّى فَدَنَا, (T,) i. e. <i>Then he</i> (Gabriel) <i>hung down</i> from the highest region of the sky, <i>and so drew near</i> to the Apostle: showing that he took him up without becoming separated from his place: or the meaning of the phrase, as it stands, is, <i>then he drew near</i> to the Prophet, <i>and he clung</i> to him: (Bd:) but accord. to Zj, it means <i>then he drew near, and drew nearer;</i> and is like the phrase دَنَا فُلَانٌ مِنِّى وَقَرُبَ.
