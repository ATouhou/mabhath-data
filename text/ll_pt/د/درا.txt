      درّاهُ; (M, TA; [or this latter has probably an intensive signification;]) <i>He pushed it,</i> or <i>thrust it;</i> or <i>pushed it,</i> or <i>thrust it, away,</i> or <i>back; repelled</i> <br>\
                  <i>it;</i> or <i>averted it;</i> syn. دَفَعَهُ; (S, * M, Mgh, * Msb, K;) namely, a thing. (Msb.) Hence, كَانَ بَيْنَ عُمَرَ وَمُعَاذِ بْنِ عَفْرَا=ءَ دَرْءٌ <br>\
                  <i>There was, between &#39;Omar and Mo&#39;ádh Ibn-&#39;Afrà, a contending, and a mutual pushing</i> or <i>thrusting,</i> &amp;amp;c. (Mgh.) And دَرَاَ عَنْهُمْ <br>\
                  <i>He repelled from them,</i> or <i>defended them;</i> as also دَرَهَ, which is formed by substitution from the former, like هَرَاقَ from اَرَاقَ. (S in art. دره.) And دَرَاَ عَنْهُ الحَدَّ <br>\
                  <i>He averted</i> (دَفَعَ) <i>from him the prescribed castigation:</i> (M, Mgh:) or <i>he deferred his prescribed castigation:</i> and in like manner the verb is used in relation to other things. (AZ, T.) It is said in a trad., اِدْرَوُوا الحُدُودَ بِالشُّبُهَاتِ [<i>Avert ye,</i> or <i>defer ye, the prescribed castigations on account of dubious circumstances</i>]. (ISk, M, TA.) And اِدْرَوُوا الحُدُودَ <br>\
                  مَا اْسْتَطَعْتُمْ [<i>Avert ye,</i> or <i>defer ye, the prescribed castigations as long as ye are able</i>]. (S, form a trad.) ―         -b2-  See also 5. ―         -b3-  دَرَاَ عَنِ البَعِيرِ الحَقَبَ is explained by Sh as meaning <i>He pushed back the kind girth of the camel:</i> but AM says that the correct meaning is, <i>he spread the kind girth upon the ground, and made the camel to lie down upon it</i> [in order that he might gird him]. (TA.) [For] دَرَاَ signifies also <i>He spread,</i> or <i>laid flat,</i> (K, TA,) a thing upon the ground. (TA.) ―         -b4-  دَرَاَ الشَّىْءَ بِالشَّىْءَ <br>\
                  <i>He supported the thing by the thing; made the. thing to be a support to the thing.</i> (TA.) [Hence,] دَرَاَ الحَايِطَ بِبِنَا=ءٍ <br>\
                  <i>He conjoined the wall with a structure</i> [<i>so as to support the former by the latter</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b5-  دَرَاَ بِحَجَرٍ <br>\
                  <i>He cast a stone;</i> like رَدَاَ. (TA.) You say, دَرَاَهُ بِحَجَر and رَدَاَهُ بِهِ <br>\
                  <i>He cast a stone at him.</i> (M in art. ردا.) ―         -b6-  دَرَاَ said of a torrent, (K,) inf. n. دَرْءٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  <i>It rushed,</i> or <i>poured forth with vehemence;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      اندرا. (K.) And دَرَاَ الوَادِى بِالسَّيْلِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The valley poured along the torrent.</i> (TA.) [See also دَرْءٌ, below.] ―         -b7-  دَرَاَ, (K,) inf. n. دُرُوْءٌ, (TA,) is syn. with طَرَاَ [<i>He came from a place,</i> or <i>from a distant place, unexpectedly;</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (K.)

      اندرا (S, TA) and ↓ <br>\
      تدرّا; (TA;) <i>Such a one came,</i> or <i>came forth, upon us unexpectedly,</i> (T, S, K, * TA,) or <i>whence we knew not;</i> as also طَرَاَ, (T,) and دَرَهَ. (IAar, TA in art. دره.) And عَلَيْهِ بِشَرٍّ ↓ <br>\
      اندرا, vulg. اندرى, <i>He came upon him suddenly with evil,</i> or <i>mischief.</i> (TA.) ―         -b8-  Hence, i. e. from دَرَاَ signifying “ he came, or came forth, unexpectedly, ” (T, S, TA,) دَرَاَ, inf. n. دُرُوْءٌ, said of a star, meaning (tropical:)  <i>It shone,</i> or <i>glistened,</i> (S, K, TA,) <i>intensely,</i> (S, TA,) and <i>its light spread:</i> (TA:) or, as some say, <i>it rose.</i> (T.) [Hence also,] دَرَاَتِ النَّارُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The fire gave light, shone, was bright,</i> or <i>shone brightly.</i> (Sh, K.)       -A2-  دَرَاَ, (T, S, K,) aor.      <br>\

                  <i>I repelled him,</i> or <i>strove to repel him.</i> (T, Msb, K.)
