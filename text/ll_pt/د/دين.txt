                  , (IAar, S, K, TA,) aor. يَدِينُ, (IAar, M, K, TA,) [inf. n. دِينٌ, (which see below,) in this and most of the other senses, or the inf. n. is دَيْنٌ, and دِينٌ is a simple subst.,] <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, obedient; he obeyed:</i> (IAar, S, M, K, TA:) this is the primary signification: or, as some say, the primary signification is the following; namely, <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, abased and submissive:</i> (IAar, * K, * TA:) or <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, abased and enslaved and obedient.</i> (S.) You say, دَانَ لَهُ, (S,) and دِنْتُ لَهُ and دِنْتُهُ, (M, TA,) <i>He,</i> and <i>I, was,</i> or <i>became, obedient to him</i> [&amp;amp;c.], or <i>obeyed him</i> [&amp;amp;c.]. (S, M, TA.) And دِنْتُهُ, (M, K,) aor. اَدِينُهُ, (K,) <i>I served him, did service for him,</i> or <i>ministered to him, and acted well to him.</i> (M, K.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] <i>He became</i> [<i>a servant of God,</i> or] <i>a Muslim.</i> (TK.) You say, دَانَ بِاْلْاـِسْلَامِ, inf. n. دِينٌ, with kesr, [and دِيَانَةٌ,] <i>He became,</i> or <i>made himself, a servant of God by</i> [<i>following the religion of</i>] <i>El-Islám;</i> [i. e. <i>he followed El-Islám as his religion;</i>] and so ↓ <br>\
      تديّن. (Msb.) And دَانَ بِكَذا, (S,) and دِنْتُ بِهِ, (M, K,) inf. n. دِيَانَةٌ [and دِينٌ]; and به ↓ <br>\
      تديّن, [and تديّنتُ به; <i>He,</i> and <i>I, followed such a thing as his,</i> and <i>my, religion;</i>] (S, TA;) from دِينٌ as signifying “ obedience. ” (S.) And دان بِدِينِهِمْ <br>\
                  <i>He followed them in their religion; agreed with them,</i> or <i>was of one mind</i> or <i>opinion with them, upon,</i> or <i>respecting, their religion; took,</i> or <i>adopted, their religion as his.</i> (TA.) And the trad. of &#39;Alee, مَحَبَّةُ العُلَمَا=ءُ دِينٌ يُدَانُ <br>\
                  اْللّٰهُ بِهِ [<i>The love of the learned is</i> a kind of <i>religion with which God is served</i>]. (TA.) In the phrase وَ لَا يَدِينُونَ دِينَ الحَقِّ [<i>Nor follow the religion of the truth,</i> or <i>the true religion</i>], in the Kur ix. 29, El-Islám is meant. (Jel.)       -A2-  Also <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, disobedient; he disobeyed:</i> and <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, mighty, potent, powerful,</i> or <i>strong;</i> or <i>high,</i> or <i>elevated, in rank, condition,</i> or <i>state; noble, honourable, glorious,</i> or <i>illustrious.</i> (IAar, T, K.) Thus it bears significations contr. to those mentioned in the first part of this paragraph. (MF.)       -A3-  Also, (S, M, Msb, K,) first pers. دِنْتُ, (T, M8gh,) aor. as above, (T, S, Msb,) inf. n. دَيْنٌ, (S, Msb,) from المُدَايَنَةُ, (Msb, [see 3,]) <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  اَخَذَ الدَّيْنَ, (IKt, M, Msb, K,) or [rather] اَخَذَ دَيْنًا, (T,) [<i>He took,</i> or <i>received, a loan,</i> or <i>the like; he borrowed:</i> or <i>he took,</i> or <i>received,</i> or <i>bought, upon credit;</i> which is the meaning generally obtaining: and ↓ <br>\
      اِدَّانَ and ↓ <br>\
      اَدَانَ and ↓ <br>\
      استدان and ↓ <br>\
      تديّن signify [in like manner] اَخَذَ دَيْنًا: (K:) or the first, i. e. دان, signifies <i>he sought,</i> or <i>demanded, a loan,</i> or <i>the like;</i> (ISk, S, Mgh, Msb;) as also ↓ <br>\
      ادّان and ↓ <br>\
      استدان: (S, Mgh:) and <i>he became indebted, in debt,</i> or <i>under the obligation of a debt:</i> (S:) and ↓ <br>\
      ادّان and ↓ <br>\
      اَدَانَ and ↓ <br>\
      استدان signify اَخَذَ بِدَيْنٍ [<i>he took,</i> or <i>received, by incurring a debt;</i> i. e. <i>he took,</i> or <i>received,</i> or <i>bought, upon credit;</i> like اَخَذَ دَيْنًا]; (M;) or the first and last of these three signify اَخَذَ الدَّيْنَ, and اِقْتَرَضَ [which means the same]: but ↓ <br>\
      اَدَانَ signifies <i>he gave,</i> or <i>granted, what is termed</i> <br>\
                  دَيْنٌ [meaning <i>a loan,</i> or  <br>\
                  <i>the like:</i> or <i>he gave,</i> or <i>granted,</i> or <i>sold, a thing upon credit</i>]: (TA:) accord. to Esh-Sheybánee, this last verb signifies <i>he became entitled to a debt from others</i> [or <i>from another</i>]: Lth says that it (اَدَانَ) signifies <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, such as is termed</i> <br>\
                  مُسْتَدِينٌ; [i. e. it is <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  استدان, as it is said to be in the M and K;] but [Az says,] this, which has been mentioned on the authority of some one or more by Sh, is in my opinion a mistake; اَدَانَ means <i>he sold upon credit;</i> or <i>became entitled to a debt from others</i> [or <i>from another</i>]; (T, TA;) or <i>he sold to persons upon a limited credit,</i> or <i>for payment at an appointed period, so that he became entitled to a debt from them:</i> (S:) and accord. to Sh, ↓ <br>\
      ادّان signifies <i>he became much in debt.</i> (T, TA.) El-Ahmar cites the following verse of El-&#39;Ojeyr Es-Saloolee: <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\

                        مَصَارِعَ قَوْمٌ لَا يَدِينُونَ ضُيَّعِ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>We incur debt, and God pays for us; and sometimes,</i> or <i>often, we see the places of overthrow of a people, who incur not debt, in a state of perdition</i>]: in the S [and the T] ضُيَّعَا; but correctly as above; for the whole of the قَصِيدَة is مَخْفُوضَة. (IB, TA.) And it is said in a trad., مُعْرِضًا ↓ <br>\
      اِدَّانَ, (S, K,) or, as some relate it, دَانَ, (K,) <i>He bought upon credit,</i> or <i>borrowed,</i> or <i>sought</i> or <i>demanded a loan, of whomsoever he could, addressing himself to such as came in his way:</i> (S, TA:) or both mean <i>he bought upon credit avoiding payment:</i> or <i>he contracted a debt with every one who presented himself to him:</i> (K, TA: [see also other explanations voce مُعْرِضٌ:]) ↓ <br>\
      ادّان signifies <i>he bought upon credit:</i> (K:) or [thus and also] <i>the contr.,</i> i. e. <i>he sold upon credit.</i> (T, K.) ―         -b2-  It is also trans.; and so is ↓ <br>\

                  دَيْنٌ [meaning <i>the loan,</i> or <i>the like; I lent to him:</i> or <i>I gave him,</i> or <i>granted him, credit;</i> or <i>sold to him, upon credit</i>]: (M, K, TA:) <i>so that he owed a debt:</i> (TA:) and <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  اَقْرَضْتُهُ [<i>I gave him,</i> or <i>granted him, a loan,</i> or <i>the like</i>]; (M, * Mgh, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      دَيَّنْتُهُ: (Mgh:) or دِنْتُهُ has this last meaning: (A &#39;Obeyd, S, M:) and ↓ <br>\
      اَدَنْتُهُ signifies <i>I sought,</i> or <i>demanded, of him a loan,</i> or <i>the like;</i> syn. اِسْتَقْرَضْتُ مِنْهُ; as also ↓ <br>\
      اِسْتَدَنْتُهُ: (M:) or دِنْتُهُ has each of the last two meanings: (A &#39;Obeyd, T, Msb:) and signifies also <i>I received from him a loan,</i> or <i>the like.</i> (K.) And one says, ↓ <br>\
      اَدِنِّى <br>\
                  عَشَرَةَ دَرَاهِمَ meaning <i>Lend thou to me ten dirhems.</i> (S, TA.)       -A4-  دانهُ, (S,) first pers. دِنْتُهُ, (M, Msb, K,) inf. n. دِينٌ (S, M, K) and دَيْنٌ, (M, K,) or the latter is the inf. n. and the former is a simple subst., (M,) also signifies <i>He repaid, requited, compensated,</i> or <i>recompensed, him,</i> (S, M, Msb, K,) بِفِعْلِهِ <br>\
                  <i>for his deed:</i> and so ↓ <br>\
      داينهُ, inf. n. مُدَايَنَةٌ and دِيَانٌ. (M.) And دِنَّاهُمْ <br>\
                  <i>We did to them like as they did to us.</i> (Ham p. 10.) One says, كَمَا تَدِينُ تُدَانُ, (T, S, M,) a prov., (M,) meaning <i>Like as thou repayest,</i> or <i>requitest,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>thou shalt be repaid,</i> or <i>requited,</i> &amp;amp;c.; (S, M;) i. e. <i>according to thy deed thou shalt be repaid,</i> or <i>requited,</i> &amp;amp;c.: (S:) or, as some say, <i>like as thou doest, it shall be done to thee:</i> (M:) or <i>like as thou doest thou shalt be given,</i> and <i>repaid,</i> &amp;amp;c. (T.) And it is said in a trad., اَللّٰهُمَّ دِنْهُمْ كَمَا <br>\
                  يَدِينُونَنَا, meaning <i>O God, repay them,</i> or <i>requite them,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>with</i> [<i>the like of</i>] <i>that which they do to us.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  اَللّٰهُ لَيَدِينُ مِنَ الجَمَّّا=ءِ لِلْقَرْنَا=ءِ, a trad. of Selmán, means <i>God will assuredly retaliate</i> [<i>for her that is hornless upon her that is horned</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b3-  And one says, مَنْ دَانَ نَفْسَهُ <br>\
                  رَبِحَ, i. e. <i>He who reckons with himself</i> [<i>gains</i>] (Ham p. 10. [Or the verb may here have the meaning next following.])       -A5-  Also, دانهُ, <i>He abased him,</i> (T, S, K,) and <i>enslaved him.</i> (T, S.) Hence, (T,) it is said in a trad., الكَيِّسُ مَنْ دَانَ <br>\
                  نَفْسَهُ وَعَمِلَ لِمَا بَعْدَ المَوْتِ, (S, T,) i. e.

(Mgh.) ―         -b3-  دَيَّنْتُ الحَالِفَ (T, TA) <i>I confirmed the swearer</i> (قَوَّيْتُهُ [so in the TA, but in the T بَرَّيْتُهُ, app. for بَرَّاْتُهُ, <i>I held him,</i> or <i>pronounced him, to be clear,</i> or <i>quit,</i> if not a mistranscription for قَوَّيْتُهُ,]) <i>in that which he swore.</i> (T, TA.)       -A2-  See also 1, in the latter half of the paragraph.       -A3-  دَيَّنْتُهُ القَوْمَ <br>\
