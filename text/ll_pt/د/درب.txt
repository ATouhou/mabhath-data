                   is not a word of Arabic origin: (Msb:) الدَّرْبٌ is [the Arabic name of the ancient <i>Derbe,</i> near the Cilician Gates, which were the chief mountain-pass, from the direction of the countries occupied by the Arabs, into the territory of the Greek Empire: these “ Gates ” are mentioned by El-Idreesee as fortified, and guarded by troops who watched the persons going and coming:] <i>a well-known place in</i> <br>\
