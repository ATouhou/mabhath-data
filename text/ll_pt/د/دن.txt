      دنّن; said of the fly, (K,) [and of the bee, and of the hornet, and the like; for] دَنْدَنَةٌ [inf. n. of دَنْدَنَ] (Lth, T, M, K) and دَنِينٌ [inf. n. of ↓ <br>\
      دَنَّ] (Lth, T, M) and ↓ <br>\
      دِنْدِنٌ [a simple subst.] (M) signify  the <i>buzzing</i> (صَوْت, Lth, T, M, K) of the fly, (M, K,) or the bee, (Lth, T,) and the hornet, (Lth, T, M, K,) and the like.

                  هَيْنَمَةٌ, (M, K,) <i>so that the speech is not understood</i>: (A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, M:) or دَنْدَنَةٌ signifies [merely] the <i>speaking in a low,</i> or <i>faint, tone</i>: (M:) accord. to IAth, it is <i>a little above what is termed</i> <br>\

                  </quote> [<i>We buzz in our speech like the buzzing of the fly</i>]. (Sh, T.) And it is said in a trad., حَوْلَهَا <br>\
                  نُدَنْدِنُ, (S,) or حَوْلَهُمَا, (M, JM, TA,) which is thus explained: the Prophet asked an Arab of the desert, “ What dost thou say in the تَشَهُّد? ” [see this word, which means the repetition of a form of words at the close of the ordinary prayers:] and he answered, “ I ask of God Paradise, and seek protection of Him from the fire [of Hell]: but as to thy دَنْدَنَة and the دَنْدَنَة of Mo&#39;ádh, I do not approve it: ” and the Prophet said, حَوْلَهُمَا نُدَنْدِنُ; (M, JM; *) i. e. [<i>We speak with a low,</i> or <i>faint, voice</i>] <i>about those two things,</i> namely, the seeking Paradise and the praying for protection from the fire [of Hell]; and <i>on account of them:</i> (JM:) accord. to some, it is from دَنْدَنَ حَوْلَ المَا=ءِ <br>\
                  <i>He went round about the water:</i> [hence it may mean <i>we utter our prayer respecting them with a low,</i> or <i>faint, sound, as though we were buzzing round about them like flies;</i> seeking to enter the one, and to keep outside the other:] As says that it may be from the signification of the sound [of buzzing], or from that of going round about: (TA:) or, accord. to one relation, the Prophet said, عَنْهُمَا نُدَنْدِنُ [<i>From a consideration of them we utter our prayer with a low,</i> or <i>faint, voice;</i>] i. e. our دَنْدَنَةُ arises from them; and is because of them: and hence, (JM,) دَنْدَنَ means also <i>He</i> (a man, JM) <i>went to and fro in one place.</i> (JM, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
