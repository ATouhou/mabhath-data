                  , (M, Msb,) inf. n. دَسٌّ (M, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and دَسِّيسَى, (K,) like خِصِّيصَى, (TA,) <i>He hid it,</i> or <i>concealed it,</i> (Lth, S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) namely, anything, (A, Mgh, Msb,) in the earth or dust, (S, Mgh,) or beneath a thing: (A, Mgh:) <i>he buried it</i> (A, Msb, K) in the earth or dust, (Msb,) or beneath a thing: (K:) or <i>he put it in,</i> or <i>inserted it, beneath:</i> (M:) or, accord. to some, <i>he put it in,</i> or <i>inserted it, with force; he thrust it in:</i> (TA:) and ↓ <br>\

      دَسَّاهُ, (M, K, *) in the latter of which one of the س is changed into ى because the reduplication is disliked, (M, * TA,) signify the same as دَسَّهُ, (M, K, *) [or, probably, have an intensive signification.] It is said in the Kur [xvi. 61], اَمْ يَدُسُّهُ التُّرَابِ <br>\
                  <i>Or whether he shall bury it in the dust:</i> meaning, his female child, which he buried alive: the pronoun agreeing with the word ما [which precedes in the same verse]. (T, TA.) It is also said in the Kur [xci. 9 and 10], قَدْ اَفْلَحَ مَنْ زَكَّاهَا وَقَدْ ↓ <br>\
      خَابَ مَنْ دَسَّاهَا, (M, K, *) in which دسّاها is for ↓ <br>\
      دَسَّسَهَا, like تَظَنَّيْتُ for تَظَنَّنْتُ, (K,) because the niggardly conceals his place of sojourning and his property, but the liberal makes his place of sojourning upon an open and elevated spot that he may not be concealed from guests and those who desire to come to him: (Fr, Zj, K: *) or the meaning is, <i>He is successful who maketh it</i> (namely his soul) <i>pure and believing, and he is unsuccessful who introduceth it among the good when he is not of them:</i> (IAar, Th, M, K: *) or [<i>he is successful who maketh it to increase in grace by good works,</i>] <i>and he is unsuccessful who maketh it vile and little by evil works:</i> (M:) or the latter clause means, <i>and he is unsuccessful who hideth it, and maketh it obscure and of no reputation, by the neglect of almsgiving and of obedience</i> [<i>to God in other matters</i>]: (TA:) or <i>the soul is unsuccessful that God rendereth obscure</i> [so I render, here, دسّاها]. (Fr, K.)       -A2-  دَسَّ البَعِيرَ, aor.      <br>\
                     دَسُ٣َ<br>\
                  , inf. n. دَسٌّ, <i>He anointed the camel with tar, not thoroughly,</i> [<i>but only in the arm-pits, and the inner parts of the roots of the thighs or other similar parts:</i>] (M:) [for it is said that] دُسَّ البَعِيرُ signifies <i>the camel was anointed with tar in the parts called the</i> <br>\
                  مَسَاعِر: (S: [see دَجَلَ:]) or the latter signifies <i>the camel became swollen in the parts so called.</i> (M.) Hence the prov., لَيْسَ الهَنْءُ بِالدَّسِّ [which see explained in art. هنا]. (TA in art. هنا. [In the S and M and TA, in the present art., instead of الهَنْءُ, we find الهِنَا=ءُ: but the former is the preferable reading.])    </entryFree> <br>\
