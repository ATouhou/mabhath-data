                  <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  دَشْتٌ, (K,) <i>A</i> [<i>desert,</i> or <i>such as is termed</i>] صَحْرَا=ء: an arabicized word [from the Pers. دَشْتْ]: (Msb, K:) or it is either a dial. var. of دشت or an arabicized word from this latter. (TA.)       -A2-  The <i>upper end of a chamber, which is the most honourable place therein:</i> (A, K, TA:) in this sense an arabicized word [from the Pers. دَسْتْ]. (K.) ―         -b2-  Hence, [<i>A place,</i> or <i>seat, of honour: a seat of office:</i> used in these senses in the present day:] used by the later writers to signify <i>a court,</i> or <i>council;</i> syn. دِيوَانٌ: and the <i>court,</i> or <i>council,</i> (مَجْلِس,) <i>of a wezeer</i> or <i>governor.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  <i>A thing against,</i> or <i>upon, which one leans,</i> or <i>stays himself:</i> (Har p. 261:) <i>a pillow,</i> or <i>cushion.</i> (Id. p. 276.)       -A3-  <i>Headship, rule, dominion, government,</i> or <i>superiority.</i> (MF.)       -A4-  <i>A game; a single act of a game</i> or <i>play:</i> pl. دُسُوتٌ. (TA.) You say, الدَّسْتُ لِى <br>\
                  <i>The game is mine:</i> and الدَّسْتُ عَلَىَّ <br>\
                  <i>The game is against me.</i> (Har p. 130.) And تَمَّ عَلَيْهِ الدَّسْتُ [<i>The game ended,</i> or <i>has ended, against him</i>]: this is said of one who is overcome: the Arabs in the Time of Ignorance used to say so when a man&#39;s arrow [in the game called المَيْسِر] was unsuccessful, and he did not attain his desire. (TA.) [In the contrary case, one says, تَمَّ لَهُ الدَّسْتُ <br>\
                  <i>The game ended,</i> or <i>has ended, in his favour.</i>] فُلَانٌ <br>\
                  حَسَنُ الدَّسْتِ [<i>Such a one is a good player</i>] is said of a skilful chess-player. (A.) And a poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        تَفَرْزَنُ فِى اُخْرَى الدُّسُوتِ البَيَاذِقُ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>The pawns become queens in the ends of the games:</i> <br>\
                  تَفَرْزَنَ being for تَتَفَرْزَنَ]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  [It is also used in the present day to signify <i>A trick of cards.</i>] ―         -b3-  And <i>An evasion, a shift, a wile,</i> or <i>an artifice;</i> or <i>art, artifice, cunning, ingenuity,</i> or <i>skill:</i> (MF, and Har p. 130:) and <i>deceit, delusion, guile,</i> or <i>circumvention.</i> (Har ibid.)       -A5-  Also, (TA,) or دَسْتٌ مِنَ الثِّيَابِ, (Msb, K, TA,) as also دَشْتٌ من الثياب, (TA in art. دشت,) [<i>A suit,</i> or <i>complete set, of clothes;</i>] the <i>clothes which a man wears and which suffice him for his going to and fro in the transaction of his affairs:</i> pl. as above: (Msb:) in this sense, also, an arabicized word [from the Pers. دَسْتْ]. (K.) El-Hareeree has mentioned together instances of this word in three different senses, in the 23rd Makámeh, where he says, نَاشَد تُّكَ اْللّٰهَ اَلَسْتَ <br>\
                  الَّذِى اَعَارَهُ الدَّسْتْ فَقُلْتُ لَا وَالَّذِى اَجْلَسَكَ فِى هٰذَا <br>\
                  الدَّسْتْ مَا اَنَا بِصَاحِبِ ذٰلِكَ الدَّسْتْ بَلْ اَنْتَ الَّذِى <br>\
                  تَمَّ عَلَيْهِ الدَّسْتْ <br>\
                  <i>I conjure thee by God</i> [to tell me], <i>art thou not he who lent him the suit of clothes? And I said, No, by Him who seated thee in this place of honour, I am not the owner of that suit of clothes: but thou art he against whom the game hath ended.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  And دَسْتٌ مِنَ الوَرَقِ, (K,) as also دَشْتٌ من الورق, (TA in art. دشت,) [<i>A quire,</i> or <i>twenty-five sheets folded together, of paper:</i> still used in this sense: pl. as above:] in this sense, also, an arabicized word [from the Pers. دَسْتْ]. (K.) ―         -b3-  [دَسْتٌ is also used in the present day in a similar, but more extensive, sense; as signifying <i>A lot,</i> or <i>parcel,</i> of things: of some things, ten; of others, twelve; &amp;amp;c.]       -A6-  Also an appellation applied, as mentioned by El-Khafájee in the “ Shifá el-Ghaleel, ” by the common people of Egypt and of other countries of the East, to <i>A copper cooking-pot:</i> (MF:) [it is still used in this sense; applied in Egypt to <i>a copper cookingpot wide at the bottom, contracted at the mouth, and more contracted a little below the mouth.</i> And دَسْتُ خَشَبٍ is applied to <i>A shallow wooden tub.</i>]   </entryFree> <br>\
