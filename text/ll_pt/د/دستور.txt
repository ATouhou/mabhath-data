                  , an arabicized word, (K,) [from the Persian دَسْتُورْ,] by some of the Arabs, [and in the present day generally,] pronounced دَسْتُورٌ, which is not absolutely erroneous, as it is the original form of the word before its being arabicized, (MF,) The <i>copy,</i> or <i>original,</i> [<i>of the register,</i> as will be seen from what follows,] <i>which is made for the several classes</i> [<i>of the officers and servants of the government</i>], <i>from which their transcription is made,</i> (expl. by النُّسْخَةُ المَعْمُولَةُ لِلْجَمَاعَاتِ اْلتَّىِ مِنْهَا تَحْرِيرُهَا, K,) <i>and in which are collected the rules and ordinances of the King;</i> (TA;) the <i>register</i> (دَفْتَر) <i>in which are collected the rules of the realm:</i> (Kull p. 186:) pl. دَسَاتِيرُ. (K.) ―         -b2-  Hence, (tropical:)  The <i>great wezeer</i> (وَزِير) <i>to whom recourse is had</i> [<i>by the King</i>] <i>with respect to what he may prescribe concerning the circumstances of the people,</i> because he is the possessor of the register so called: (Mefáteeh el-&#39;Uloom by Ibn-Kemál-Páshà, in TA; and Kull ubi suprà:) the <i>officer who manages, conducts, orders,</i> or <i>regulates, the affairs of the King.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  [Hence also, in the conventional language of astronomy, (tropical:)  <i>An almanac.</i>] ―         -b4-  Also, vulgarly, <i>Permission; leave.</i> (TA.) [For instance, it is used in this sense by a man entering a house, or approaching an apartment, in which he supposes that there may be some woman whom he should not see unveiled, in order that she may veil herself or retire: on such an occasion, he repeats the word دستور several times as he advances.]   </entryFree> <br>\
