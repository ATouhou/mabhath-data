                  , (K,) inf. n. دَغْمٌ, (JK, S,) <i>He,</i> or <i>it, broke</i> the nose, <i>making the breach to extend into the interior.</i> (JK, S, K. [So too accord. to the explanation of the inf. n. in the KL; though Golius renders it, and app. دَغَّمَ also, as on the authority of the KL, “ <i>depressit</i> nasum; ” while Freytag follows him in thus rendering only the latter verb; which I do not find in any Lexicon.])       -A2-  Also, (M, K,) inf. n. as above, (M, TA,) <i>He covered</i> a vessel. (M, K.) ―         -b2-  And, said of rain, <i>It covered,</i> or <i>overwhelmed,</i> and <i>prevailed over,</i> or <i>subdued,</i> the earth, or land; as also ↓ <br>\
      ادغم. (TA.) ―         -b3-  And دَغَمَهُمْ, (S, K,) aor.      <br>\
                     دَغَمَ<br>\
                  ; (K;) and دَغِمَهُمْ, (S, K,) aor.      <br>\
                     دَغَمَ<br>\
                  ; (K;) inf. n. دَغْمٌ and دَغَمانٌ; (TA;) said of heat, (S, K,) and of cold also, (JK, K,) <i>It came upon them,</i> <br>\
                   [properly] <i>as though it were a thing that covered them;</i> syn. غَشِيَهُمْ; as also ↓ <br>\
      اَدْغَمَهُمْ. (S, K. [Golius, app. misled by a wrong interpretation which I find in the KL, (mentioned by him as one of his authorities in this case, in addition to the S and K,) explains these three verbs as meaning “ totum corripuit, et deliquio animi affecit: ” and Freytag has followed him herein.])       -A3-  [The inf. n.] دَغْمًا is also used, (K, TA,) in a form of imprecation, (TA,) as an imitative sequent to رَغْمًا [q. v.], and is in like manner followed by سِنَّغْمًا, (K, TA,) or شِنَّغْمًا. (TA.) And one says, فَعَلْتُ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى <br>\
                  رَغْمِهِ وَدَغْمِهِ وَشِنَّغْمِهِ [meaning <i>I did that in spite of him;</i> or <i>against his will</i>]. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   see above, in two places.       -A2-  ادغم الفَرَسَ <br>\
                  اللِّجَامَ <br>\
                  <i>He put the bit into the mouth of the horse;</i> (JK, Az, S, K;) as also ادغم اللِّجَامَ فِى <br>\
                  فَمِ الفَرَسِ. (TA.) ―         -b2-  And hence, (Az, S, TA,) though some say that the reverse is the case, (TA,) ادغم الحَرْفَ (Az, S, K) فِى الحَرْفِ, (K,) inf. n. اـِدْغَامٌ, (JK, S,) <i>He inserted</i> [or <i>incorporated</i>] <i>the letter into the letter;</i> (JK, K, TA;) as also ↓اِدَّغَمَهُ, (S, K,) [which is itself an example of the incorporation of one letter into another, being] originally اِدْتَغَمَهُ. (S, TA.)       -A3-  ادغمهُ, said of God, <i>He blackened his face:</i> (K:) and <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  اَرْغَمَهُ; (K, * TA;) both signify (tropical:)  <i>He did evil to him, and angered him:</i> or the former verb has the former of these significations, explained in the K; and the latter verb signifies, with its pronoun, “ he angered him. ” (TA.) ―         -b2-  ادغمهُ اـِلَى كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>He,</i> or <i>it, caused him to want such a thing;</i> (AA, TA in art. دمغ;) [and] so ادغمهُ لِكَذَا; (L in art. جلد;) as also ادمغهُ. (AA, L in art. جلد voce اَجْلَدَ, and TA in art. دمغ.)       -A4-  ادغم فُلَانٌ <br>\
                  <i>Such a one vied,</i> or <i>strove, with the people,</i> or <i>party, in hastening</i> [<i>to eat</i>], <i>fearing lest they should be before him, and therefore ate the food without chewing.</i> (K, * TA.) [And اَدْمَغَ طَعَامَهُ, as explained in the TA in art. دمغ, has a similar meaning.]    </entryFree> <br>\

It is said in a prov., الذّيْبُ اَدْغَمُ [<i>The wolf is blackish in the face and in the part next the lips, not being so in the other parts;</i> or rather, <i>is black in the nose</i>]: for, whether he lap from a vessel or not, دُغْمَة is a necessary characteristic of the wolf, [all] wolves being دُغْم; and therefore he is sometimes, or often, suspected of having lapped from a vessel when he is [really] hungry: the prov. is applied to him who is regarded with a wish for the like of that which he has not obtained.
