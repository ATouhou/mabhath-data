                  , (S, Msb, Mughnee, K,) indecl., (S, Msb,) with damm for its termination, (S, Msb, Mughnee,) as being likened to final words [such as قَبْلُ and بَعْدُ ending a proposition], (S, Mughnee,) because it does not [regularly] occur otherwise than prefixed to a proposition, (S,) for the being prefixed to a proposition is like the not being prefixed to anything, as the consequence of being prefixed, which is the sign of the gen. case, is not apparent: (Mughnee:) and حَيْثَ, (S, Mughnee, K,) also indecl., (S,) with fet-h, (S, Mughnee,) to render the pronunciation more easy, (Mughnee,) because damm with ى is deemed difficult to pronounce: (S:) and حَيْثِ, (Mughnee, K,) with kesr, accord. to the general rule observed to prevent the concurrence of two quiescent letters: (Mughnee:) and in like manner, حَوْثُ and حَوْثَ and حَوْثِ: (Mughnee, TA:) of which forms, حوث is asserted to be the original; (L;) though حَيْثُ is more chaste than حَوْثُ, and is the form used in the Kur-án: (Az and TA in art. حوث:) but some of the Arabs make حيث decl.: (Mughnee:) it is an adverbial noun of place, (S, Msb,) a vague adverbial noun of place, (L,) [signifying <i>Where,</i>] like حِينَ with respect to time: (S, K:) or it is a denotative of place, by general consent: but accord. to Akh it sometimes occurs as denoting time, [signifying <i>when,</i>] as in the following verse, (Mughnee, TA,) which is the strongest evidence of its use in this sense: (TA:) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        حَيْثَمَا تَسْتَقِمْ يُقَدِّرْ لَكَ اْللّٰ<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        هُ نَجَاحًا فِى غَابِرِ الاَزْمَانِ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>Whenever thou shalt pursue a right course, God will decree thee success in the time to come</i>]: (Mughnee, TA:) but in most instances it occupies the place of an accus., as an adverbial noun of place; or of a gen., governed by مِنْ, and sometimes by another prep., as in the saying (of Zuheyr, TA in art. قشعم), <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        لَدَى حَيْثُ اَلْقَتْ رَحْلَهَااُمُّ قَشْعَمِ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>At the place where Calamity,</i> or <i>Fate, has put down her saddle,</i> i. e., <i>made her abode</i>]: and sometimes it occurs as an objective complement, as it is said to do in اَللّٰهُ اَعْلَمُ حَيْثُ يَجْعَلُ رِسَالَاتِهِ [in the Kur vi. 124], i. e. <i>God is knowing:</i> He knows <i>where to bestow his apostolic commissions;</i> <br>\
                  يَعْلَمُ being suppressed, as implied by اَعْلَمُ; or اَعْلَمُ may be rendered by عَالِمٌ, and so may govern the accus. case. (Mughnee.) Accord. to rule, (Mughnee,) in every instance, (S, Mughnee,) it is prefixed to a proposition, (S, Msb, Mughnee,) nominal, or verbal, but in most cases the latter; (Mughnee;) as in اَقُومُ حَيْثُ يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ [<i>I will stand where Zeyd shall stand</i>]; and حَيْثُ تَكُونُ <br>\
                  اَكُونُ [<i>Where thou shalt be, I will be</i>]; (S;) and جَلَسْتُ حَيْثُ زَيْدًا اَرَاهُ [<i>I sat where I saw Zeyd</i>], the accus. case being preferred in an instance like this; (Mughnee;) and اذْهَبْ حَيْثُ شيْتَ [<i>Go thou whither thou wilt.</i>] (Msb in art. حَين.) You should not say حَيْثُ زَيْدٌ [alone]: (S:) or it occurs prefixed to a single word in poetry; (Msb, Mughnee;) as in the saying, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَنَطْعُنُهُمْ تَحْتَ الكُلَى بَعْدَ ضَرْبِهِمْ<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        بِبِيضِ المَوَاضِى حَيْثُ لَىِّ العَمَايِمِ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>And we pierce them beneath the kidneys, after smiting them, with the sharp swords, where the turbans are wound</i>]; (Mughnee;) but this is irregular; (Msb, Mughnee;) though Ks holds it to be regular. (Mughnee.) Lh relates, on the authority of Ks, that some make حيث to govern a noun in the gen. case, as in the saying, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        اَمَا تَرَى حَيْثُ سُهَيْلٍ طَالِعَا<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>Seest thou not where Canopus is, rising?</i>]: but he says that this is not of respectable authority: (L:) some write حَيْثَ سُهَيْلٍ: and some, حَيْثُ <br>\
                  سُهَيْلٌ, [which is the common reading, سهيل being an inchoative, and] the enunciative, مَوْجُودٌ, being suppressed. (Mughnee.) Abu-l-Fet-h says that he who prefixes حيث to a single word makes it declinable. (Mughnee.) [Accord. to Fei,] BenooTemeem say حَيْثَ when it occupies the place of an accus., as in the phrase, قُمْ حَيْثَ يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ [<i>Stand thou where Zeyd shall stand</i>]. (Msb.) Ks says, I have heard among Benoo-Temeem, of Benoo-Yarbooa and Tuheiyeh, those who say حَيْثَ in every case, when it occupies the place of a gen., and that of an accus., and that of a nom.; saying مِنْ حَيْثَ لَايَعْلَمُونَ [<i>Whence they know not</i>], and حَيْثَ اْلْتَقَيْنَا [<i>Where we met</i>]: and he says also, I have heard some of Benu-l-HárithIbn-Asad-Ibn-El-Hárith-Ibn-Thaalabeh, and all Benoo-Fak&#39;as, say حَيْثِ when it occupies the place of a gen., and حَيْثَ when it occupies the place of an accus.; saying مِنْ حَيْثِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ, and حَيْثَ اْلْتَقَيْنَا. (L.) Sometimes the proposition after حيث commences with اـِنَّ, as in اِجْلِسْ حَيْثُ <br>\
                  اـِنَّ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ [<i>Sit thou where Zeyd is sitting</i>]. (K in art. ان, and IAk p. 92.) ―         -b2-  It sometimes comprises the meanings of two adverbial nouns of place, as when you say, حَيْثُ عَبْدُ اْللّٰهِ قَاعِدٌ زَيْدٌ قَايِمٌ [<i>Where&#39; Abd-Allah is sitting, there Zeyd is standing</i>]. (AHeyth, L.) ―         -b3-  The restrictive مَا (مَا <br>\
                  كَافَّةٌ) is sometimes affixed to it, and in this case it implies a conditional meaning, [signifying <i>Wherever,</i> or <i>wheresoever,</i> and, accord. to Akh, <i>whenever,</i> or <i>whensoever,</i>] (Mughnee, TA,) and renders two verbs mejzoom, (Mughnee,) as in the saying, حَيْثُمَا تَجْلِسْ اَجْلِسْ [<i>Wherever thou shalt</i> <br>\
                  <i>sit, I will sit</i>], (S,) and in the first of the verses cited above: (Mughnee, TA:) it is not [properly, though it is sometimes improperly,] used as a conditional without ما. (S.) ―         -b4-  [It is also used, in scientific and other post-classical works, in senses different from those explained above. Thus, مِنْ حَيْثُ is used to signify <i>As to,</i> or <i>in respect of:</i> so in the phrase مِنْ حَيْثُ اللَّفْظِ وَالمَعْنَى <br>\
                  <i>As to,</i> or <i>in respect of, the word and the meaning.</i> Also <i>As,</i> or <i>considered as, absolutely,</i> or <i>abstractedly:</i> so in the phrase مِنْ حَيْثُ هُوَ, or مِنْ <br>\
                  حَيْثُ هُوَ هُوَ, <i>As,</i> or <i>considered as, such, absolutely,</i> or <i>abstractedly;</i> and الاـِنْسَانُ مِنْ حَيْثُ هُوَ <br>\
                  اـِنْسَانٌ <br>\
                  <i>Man, as,</i> or <i>considered as, man, absolutely,</i> or <i>abstractedly.</i> And <i>As,</i> meaning <i>considered merely</i> or <i>only</i> or <i>simply as:</i> so in the saying, الاـِنْسَانُ مِنْ حَيْثُ اـِنَّهُ يَصِحُّ وَتَزُولُ عَنْهُ السِّحَّةُ <br>\
                  مَوْضُوعُ الطِّبِّ <br>\
                  <i>Man, as,</i> or <i>considered merely</i> or <i>only</i> or <i>simply as, being healthy and ceasing to be healthy, is the object of therapeutics.</i> And <i>As,</i> meaning <i>since,</i> or <i>because:</i> so in the saying, النَّارُ مِنْ حَيْثُ اـِنَّهَا حَارَّةٌ تُسَخِّنُ المَا=ءَ <br>\
                  <i>Fire, as,</i> or <i>since,</i> or <i>because, it is hot, heats water.</i> <br>\
                  بِحَيْثُ is also vulgarly used in this sense. And correctly as meaning <i>So that; so as that; in such a state,</i> or <i>condition, that:</i> often <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
