                  الحِنْث, i. e. <i>sin,</i> or <i>crime:</i> (ISd, Towsheeh, TA:) it is said that there are only six verbs of the measure of this signifying the putting away, or casting away, from oneself a thing, [i. e. the thing denoted by the root,] which are تحنّث and تاثّم and تحوّب and تحرّج and تنجّس and تهجّد: (TA:) (assumed tropical:)  <i>he did a work whereby to escape from sin,</i> or <i>crime:</i> (IAar, Msb:) (assumed tropical:)  <i>he applied himself to acts,</i> or <i>exercises, of devotion;</i> (S, A, Msb, K;) accord. to Ez-Zuhree and the K, during numerous nights; but it has been shown by the Expositors of El-Bukháree, and others, that this addition is taken from words following the verb in the explanation of a trad., and has nothing to do with the meaning of the verb itself: (MF, TA:) (assumed tropical:)  <i>he relinquished</i> [<i>the worship of</i>] <i>idols;</i> (S, K;) like تحنّف; (S;) and it may be that the ث in this verb is interchangeable with ف, (A,) or a substitute for ف. (TA.) You say also, تحنّث مِنْ كَذَا (tropical:)  <i>He abstained from such a thing as a sin,</i> or <i>crime;</i> syn. تاثّم, (S, A, K,) and تحرّج. (A.) And تحنّث بِاَفْعَالٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He sought to bring himself near unto God,</i> or <i>to advance himself in God&#39;s favour, by works</i> [of devotion &amp;amp;c.].

                   The <i>violation,</i> or <i>failure of performance, of an oath:</i> (S, A, K, TA:) [an inf. n. used as a simple subst.:] pl. اَحْنَاثٌ; as in the saying, عَلَيْهِ اَحْنَاثٌ كَثِيرَةٌ [<i>He is accountable for,</i> or <i>chargeable with, many violations,</i> or <i>failures of performance, of oaths</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  (tropical:)  <i>A sin, a crime, an offence,</i> or <i>an act of disobedience.</i> (S, A, Msb, K.) So in the saying [in the Kur lvi. 45], وَكَانُوا يُصِرُّونَ عَلَى الحِنْثِ العَظِيمِ (tropical:)  [<i>And they persisted in great sin</i>]; (A;) meaning belief in a plurality of gods. (Bd, Jel.) And hence, (Bd in lvi. 45,) بَلَغَ الحِنْثَ (tropical:)  <i>He</i> (a boy) <i>attained to the age when he was punishable for sin:</i> (A, * Bd:) or <i>attained to</i> [<i>the age when he became punishable for</i>] <i>disobedience and</i> [<i>rewardable for</i>] <i>obedience:</i> (S:) or <i>attained to the age when the pen</i> [<i>of the recording angels</i>] <i>began to register his acts of obedience and of disobedience: attained to the age of puberty: attained to manhood.</i> (TA.) [Hence also,] اَوْلَادُ الحِنْثِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The children of adultery</i> or <i>fornication:</i> occurring in a trad., accord. to one reading: accord. to another reading, اولاد الخُبْثِ.
