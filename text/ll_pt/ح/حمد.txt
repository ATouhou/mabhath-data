                  , inf. n. حَمْدٌ (S, L, Msb, K) and مَحْمَدٌ and مَحْمِدٌ (L, K) and مَحْمَدَةٌ (S, L, K) and مَحْمِدَةٌ; (L, K, and so in a copy of the S;) the last of these inf. ns. [and the third also] extr.; (L;) or the last is an inf. n. and the last but one signifies “ a praiseworthy quality, ” or “ a quality for which one is praised; ” (ElFenáree, MF;) or the last may be a simple subst.; (Har p. 392;) <i>He praised, eulogized,</i> or <i>commended, him; spoke well of him; mentioned him with approbation;</i> (Akh, S, L, Msb;) عَلَى كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>for such a thing;</i> (L, Msb;) <i>contr. of</i> <br>\
                  ذَمَّهُ: (S, L:) accord. to IAmb, formed by transposition from مَدَحَ: (marginal note in a copy of the MS:) but it is of less common application than the latter verb; (Msb in art. مدح;) signifying <i>he praised him,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>for something depending on his</i> (the latter&#39;s) <i>own will:</i> thus, the describing a pearl as clear is not حَمْدٌ, but it is مَدْحٌ: (Kull p. 150:) or <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  شَكَرَهُ: (Lh, K:) but it differs [sometimes] from this; (Msb;) for شُكْرٌ is only on account of favour received; whereas حَمْدٌ is sometimes because of favour received, (Th, Az, Msb,) and sometimes from other causes; (Th;) [and thus] the latter is of more common application than the former; (S;) therefore you do not say, شَكَرْتُهُ <br>\
                  عَلَى شَجَاعَتِهِ; but you say, حَمِدْتُهُ على شجاعته <br>\
                  <i>I praised him,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>for his courage.</i> (Msb.) حمد also implies admiration: and it implies the magnifying, or honouring, of the object thereof; and lowliness, humility, or submissiveness, in the person who offers it; as in the saying of the afflicted, الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ <br>\
                  <i>Praise be to God;</i> since in this case there is no worldly blessing, favour, or  benefit. (Msb.) This last phrase is generally pronounced as it is written above: but some of the Arabs are related to have pronounced it الحَمْدَ لِلّٰهِ, putting the former word in the accus. case as the absolute complement of the verb اَحْمَدُ understood: and others, الحَمْدِلِلّٰهِ; assimilating the final vowel of the former word to the vowel immediately following it: and others, الحَمْدُ لُلّٰهِ; assimilating the first vowel in للّٰه to the vowel immediately preceding it: Zj, however, disapproves of the latter two modes of pronouncing it: some of them also said, بَدَاْتُ <br>\
                  بِالحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ, meaning <i>I began with</i> the saying <i>Praise be to God.</i> (L.) [See also حَمْدٌ below.] You say, اَحْمَدُ اـِلَيْكَ اْللّٰهَ <br>\
                  <i>I praise God</i> (Az, A, * L, K) <i>to thee,</i> or <i>in thy presence:</i> (L:) or <i>with thee:</i> (Kh, Az:) or <i>I praise to thee God&#39;s benefits, and his blessings,</i> or <i>favours;</i> or <i>I praise to thee God&#39;s blessings,</i> or <i>favours, and discourse to thee of them.</i> (L.) And حَمِدَ لَهُ اَمْرًا (tropical:)  <i>He approved of a thing for him.</i> (L, K. *) And حَمِدَ اـِلَيْهِ اَمْرًا (tropical:)  <i>He approved of a thing for him, and commanded,</i> or <i>enjoined, him to do it.</i> (L.) And جاوَرْتُهُ فَمَا حَمِدْتُ جِوَارَهُ (tropical:)  [<i>I became his neighbour, and did not approve of being so</i>]. (A.) See also 4. ―         -b2-  Also, (aor. and inf. n. as above in the beginning of this art., K,) <i>He recompensed,</i> or <i>requited, him: he gave him,</i> or <i>paid him, his due.</i> (L, K.)       -A2-  حَمِدَ عَلَيْهِ, aor.      <br>\
