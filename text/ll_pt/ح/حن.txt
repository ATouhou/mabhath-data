                  , inf. n. حَنِينٌ, <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, affected with</i> [<i>a yearning, longing,</i> or <i>desire,</i> or] <i>an intense emotion of grief</i> or <i>of joy;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      استحنّ and ↓ <br>\
      تحانّ. (K.) [See an instance of its denoting an emotion of joy voce حَنَّانٌ.] You say, حَنَّ اـِلَيْهِ, aor. and inf. n. as above, <i>He,</i> or <i>his soul, yearned towards, longed for,</i> or <i>desired, him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (S.) And حَنَّ اـِلَى وَطَنِهِ <br>\
                  <i>He yearned towards, longed for,</i> or <i>desired, his home.</i> (TA.) And تَحِنَّ اـِلَى زَوْجِهَا الاَوَّلِ [<i>She yearns towards her first,</i> or <i>former, husband</i>]. (TA.) And حَنَّتْ, inf. n. as above, <i>She</i> (a woman) <i>yearned towards, longed for,</i> or <i>desired, her child,</i> or <i>children.</i> (Msb.) So, too, one says of a she-camel, meaning <i>She yearned towards, longed for,</i> or <i>desired, her home,</i> or <i>her young one;</i> and in like manner, of a pigeon: but in most instances it means <i>she</i> (a camel) <i>yearned with a cry,</i> or <i>uttered a cry when yearning</i> [or <i>a yearning cry</i> or <i>the cry produced by yearning</i>], towards her young one or her companions: or <i>she uttered a cry with emotion</i> after her young one: in its primary sense, <i>she reiterated her</i> [<i>yearning</i>] <i>cry after her young one:</i> but when you say, حَنَّ قَلْبِى اـِلَيْهِ, you mean <i>My heart yearned towards, longed for,</i> or <i>desired, him,</i> or <i>it,</i> without the uttering of a cry or sound. (TA.) They said also, لَااَفْعَلُهُ حَتَّى يَحِنَّ الضَّبُّ <br>\

                  <i>yearn after the camels returning from the water;</i> meaning <i>I will never do it</i>]: this is only a prov.; for the ضبّ has no حَنِين nor does it ever go to the water. (TA.) [And حنَّ العُودُ, aor. and inf. n. as above, (assumed tropical:)  <i>The lute produced plaintive sounds:</i> or <i>excited lively emotions of sadness,</i> or <i>of mirth:</i> see حَنَّانٌ.

                  السَّارِيَةُ [<i>The mast creaked,</i> or <i>made a creaking sound</i>]. (TA in art. صر.) And حَنَّ قِدْحُ لَيْسَ مِنْهَا (assumed tropical:)  [<i>An arrow of those used in the game called</i> <br>\
                  المَيْسِر <br>\
                  <i>produced a sound: it was not of them</i>]: a prov., applied to a man who ascribes to himself a false origin, or who arrogates to himself that to which he has no relation: by the قدح is meant one of the arrows of the ميسر; for when this is not of the same substance as the others, and is made to vibrate, it produces a sound different from the sounds of the others, and is known thereby.
