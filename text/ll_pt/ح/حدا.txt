                  فَاْس [i. e. <i>hoe,</i> or <i>adz,</i> or <i>axe</i>]: (As, S, K:) [a kind of فَاْس used in the present day is a hoe with two heads, one at each end of the handle:] or the <i>head of a</i> <br>\
                  فَاْس: and the <i>head of an arrow:</i> (K:) pl. of the former ↓ <br>\
      حَدَاٌ (As, S, K) [or rather this is a coll. gen. n.] and حِدَا=ءٌ, (K, TA, [in the CK حَداءٌ,]) mentioned by AO and As and A &#39;Obeyd; (TA;) and the pl. of حِدَاَةٌ is ↓ <br>\

                  , (S, Msb, K,) or ↓ <br>\
      حِدَاٌ, [but see what follows,] sometimes pronounced ↓ <br>\
      حَدَاٌ, (Mgh,) [The <i>kite;</i> vulgarly called حِدَايَة;] <i>a certain bird,</i> (S, Mgh, K,) <i>well known;</i> (S, K;) <i>a certain noxious bird;</i> (Msb;) <i>surnamed</i> <br>\
                  اَبُوالخَطَّافِ <br>\
                  <i>and</i> <br>\
                  ابو الصَّلْتِ; (TA;) <i>that preys upon large field-rats</i> (جِرْذَان): (Mgh, TA:) J and Sgh say that the word should not be pronounced ↓ <br>\
      حَدَاَةٌ; but AHei mentions this pronunciation on the authority of [some of] the Arabs; and accord. to IAar and IAmb, the فَاْس [see above] and this bird were sometimes called alike ↓ <br>\
      حَدَاَةٌ and ↓ <br>\
      حَدَاٌ: the more approved pronunciation of the name of the bird, however, is with kesr [i. e. حِدَاَةٌ]: the pl. is ↓ <br>\
      حِدَاٌ (S, Msb, K) and حِدَا=ءٌ, (K,) both extr., (TA,) [or rather the former is a coll. gen. n.,] and حِدْا=نٌ: (Msb, K:) and the following are variations of the name of this bird: حُدَّى, and حُدَيَّا, (TA,) the latter said by AHát to be an erroneous form of the word, used by the people of El-Hijáz, (Mgh, TA,) and ↓ <br>\
      حُدَيْيِيَةٌ, app. a dim., for ↓ <br>\
      حُدَيْيَةٌ, also pronounced حُدَيَّةٌ, (TS, TA,) and حُدُوٌّ, occurring in a trad. in conjunction with اُفْعُوٌّ [for اَفْعًى], (Mgh, TA,) of the dial. of the people of Mekkeh. (TA in art. حدو.)  Hence the saying, وَرَا=ءَكِ بُنْدُقَة ↓ <br>\
      حِدَاَ حِدَاَ, (S, K, TA,) for which the vulgar say, حَدَا حَدَا, (S,) [accord. to some, meaning <i>O kite, O kite, a bullet is behind thee:</i> accord. to others, <i>O Hidà, O Hidà, Bundukah is behind thee:</i>] Esh-Sharkee (Ibn-El-Kutámee, TA) says, (S,) حِدَاٌ and بُنْدُقَةُ were two tribes, descendants of حِدَاُ بْنُ نَمِرَةَ and بُنْدُقَةُ بْنُ مَظَّةَ, (S, K, *) and both of سَعْدُ العَشِيرَةِ; (S, TA;) the former in El-Koofeh, and the latter in El-Yemen: the former attacked the latter, and obtained spoil from them; and then the latter attacked the former, and destroyed them: (TA:) and hence this saying: (S, K, TA:) or حِدَاَ is here an apocopated form of حِدَاَة: (S, K:) so says ISk: (S:) and AO says that by it is here meant the bird [i. e. the kite]; and by بندقة, the thing with which one shoots [from a cross-bow, namely, a bullet]; and the prov. is used to caution a person: accord. to Ibn-El-Kelbee, it is applied to him who esteems himself cunning in an affair, and is outwitted therein by another: accord. to the A, to him who is threatened with an evil near at hand. (TA.)       -A2-  حِدَاَةٌ also signifies The سَالِفَة (meaning the <i>fore part,</i> TA, [or the <i>fore part from beneath the ear to the middle of the collarbone,</i>]) <i>of the neck of a horse:</i> (As, K:) pl. حِدَا=ء/ق.
