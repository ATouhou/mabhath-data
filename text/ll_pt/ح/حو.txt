                  , (As, S, K,) [like اِرْعَوَى, originally اِحْوَوَّ, of the measure اِفْعَلَّ, then اِحْوَوَوَ, and then اِحْوَوَى,] aor. يَحْوَوِى, inf. n. اِحْوِوَا=ءٌ, said of a horse, (As, S,) <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, of the colour termed</i> <br>\
                  حُوَّةٌ [q. v. infrà]; as also ↓ <br>\
      اِحْوَاوَى, (As, S, K,) [originally اِحْوَاوَّ, of the measure اِفْعَالَّ, then اِحْوَاوَوَ, and then اِحْوَاوَى,] aor. يَحْوَاوِى, inf. n. اِحْوِيوَا=ءٌ, (As, S,) or, accord. to ISd, correctly, اِحْوِيَّا=ءٌ, because the ى changes the و [after it] into ى, as it does in اَيَّامٌ [which is originally اَيْوَامٌ]; (TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      اِحْوَوَّى, (ISd, K,) [accord. to the pronunciation of the Koofees, as will be seen below, originally اِحْوَوَّوَ,] said by IB to be found thus written in some of the copies of the book of As, [that entitled كِتَابُ الفَرَسِ,] but to be a mistake, because it is agreed that there is not in the language a verb ending with three letters of the same kind except اِبْيَضَضَّ [for اِبْيَضَّ]; (TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      حَوِىَ, (As, S, K,) like رَضِىَ, (K,) [originally حَوِوَ,] aor. يَحْوِى, inf. n. حُوَّةٌ, (As, S,) or حَوًى; (K;) this last verb mentioned by As as used by some of the Arabs. (S.) And الاَرْضُ ↓ <br>\

                  <i>The land was,</i> or <i>became, green;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      اِحْوَوَّت; (K;) [or the latter is correctly اِحْوَوَت:] IJ says that ↓ <br>\
      اِحْوَاوَت is of the measure اِفْعَالَّت, [originally اِحْوَاوَّت, then احْوَاوَوَت. and then اِحْوَاوَت,] and that the Koofees say اِحْوَاوَّت and ↓ <br>\
      اِحْوَوَّت; but ISd says that their usage is wrong, for the Arabs say اِحْوَوَى, like اِرْعَوَى, and do not say اِحْوَوَّ. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

      اُحَىٍّ, after the manner of اُحَيْوٍ, which, also, Sb disallows: Yoo says ↓ <br>\
