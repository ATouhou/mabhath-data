      حَدَاَةٌ; but AHei mentions this pronunciation on the authority of [some of] the Arabs; and accord. to IAar and IAmb, the فَاْس [see above] and this bird were sometimes called alike ↓ <br>\
      حَدَاَةٌ and ↓ <br>\
      حَدَاٌ: the more approved pronunciation of the name of the bird, however, is with kesr [i. e. حِدَاَةٌ]: the pl. is ↓ <br>\
      حِدَاٌ (S, Msb, K) and حِدَا=ءٌ, (K,) both extr., (TA,) [or rather the former is a coll. gen. n.,] and حِدْا=نٌ: (Msb, K:) and the following are variations of the name of this bird: حُدَّى, and حُدَيَّا, (TA,) the latter said by AHát to be an erroneous form of the word, used by the people of El-Hijáz, (Mgh, TA,) and ↓ <br>\
      حُدَيْيِيَةٌ, app. a dim., for ↓ <br>\
      حُدَيْيَةٌ, also pronounced حُدَيَّةٌ, (TS, TA,) and حُدُوٌّ, occurring in a trad. in conjunction with اُفْعُوٌّ [for اَفْعًى], (Mgh, TA,) of the dial. of the people of Mekkeh. (TA in art. حدو.) &lt;pb n=&quot;527&quot; TEIform=&quot;pb&quot;/&gt; Hence the saying, وَرَا=ءَكِ بُنْدُقَة ↓ <br>\
      حِدَاَ حِدَاَ, (S, K, TA,) for which the vulgar say, حَدَا حَدَا, (S,) [accord. to some, meaning &lt;i&gt;O kite, O kite, a bullet is behind thee:&lt;/i&gt; accord. to others, &lt;i&gt;O Hidà, O Hidà, Bundukah is behind thee:&lt;/i&gt;] Esh-Sharkee (Ibn-El-Kutámee, TA) says, (S,) حِدَاٌ and بُنْدُقَةُ were two tribes, descendants of حِدَاُ بْنُ نَمِرَةَ and بُنْدُقَةُ بْنُ مَظَّةَ, (S, K, *) and both of سَعْدُ العَشِيرَةِ; (S, TA;) the former in El-Koofeh, and the latter in El-Yemen: the former attacked the latter, and obtained spoil from them; and then the latter attacked the former, and destroyed them: (TA:) and hence this saying: (S, K, TA:) or حِدَاَ is here an apocopated form of حِدَاَة: (S, K:) so says ISk: (S:) and AO says that by it is here meant the bird [i. e. the kite]; and by بندقة, the thing with which one shoots [from a cross-bow, namely, a bullet]; and the prov. is used to caution a person: accord. to Ibn-El-Kelbee, it is applied to him who esteems himself cunning in an affair, and is outwitted therein by another: accord. to the A, to him who is threatened with an evil near at hand. (TA.)       -A2-  حِدَاَةٌ also signifies The سَالِفَة (meaning the &lt;i&gt;fore part,&lt;/i&gt; TA, [or the &lt;i&gt;fore part from beneath the ear to the middle of the collarbone,&lt;/i&gt;]) &lt;i&gt;of the neck of a horse:&lt;/i&gt; (As, K:) pl. حِدَا=ء/ق.
