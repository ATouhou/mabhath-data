      تحشّاهُ. (Lh, K, TA.) You say, شَتَمْتُهُمْ وَ مَا حَاشَيْتُ مِنْهُمْ <br>\
                  اَحَدًا and ↓ <br>\
      ما تَحَشَّيْتُ, i. e. [<i>I reviled them and</i>] <i>I did not say</i> [<i>of any one of them</i>] حَاشَى لِفُلَانٍ [<i>Far is such a one</i> from being included among those of whom I speak! or from any cause of reproach!]; or <i>I did not except, of them, any one.</i> (Lh, TA. [The same saying is repeated in the TA, in the supplement to this art. of the K, but with the substitution of حشيت for حاشيت; perhaps by a mistake of the copyist: or it may be inferred from a statement of Fr and IAmb, which will be found below, that one also says ما ↓ <br>\
      حَشَيْتُ.]) And En-Nábighah [Edh-Dhubyánee] says, (Mbr, S.) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَ لَا اَرَى فَاعِلًا فِى النَّاسِ يُشْبِهُهُ<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَ مَا اُحَاشِى مِنَ الاَقْوَامِ مِنْ اَحَدِ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>And I shall not see an actor among mankind resembling him; and I do not except, of the companies of men, any one</i>]: which shows حَاشِى to be a verb perfectly inflected. (Mbr, S, Mughnee.) And hence the trad. of the Prophet, قَال اُسَامَةُ <br>\
                  اَحَبُّ النَّاسِ اـِلَىَّ مَا حَاشَى فَاطِمَةَ, i. e. [<i>He said, Usámeh is the most beloved of men to me:</i>] <i>he did not except Fátimeh:</i> <br>\
                  ما being here a negative; not, as Ibn-Málik imagines, supposing this clause to be of the words of the Prophet, the ما which, with a verb following it, conveys the meaning of an inf. n. (Mughnee.) ―         -b2-  حَاشَى also denotes exception as a particle, or as a verb (S, Mughnee) having but one tense and no inf. n., (Mughnee,) according as it governs a gen. or an accus. case. (S.) You say, زَيْدٍ ↓ <br>\
      ضَرَبْتُهُمْ حَاشَى [<i>I beat them, except Zeyd</i>], using it as a particle; and ضربتهم <br>\
                  حاشى زَيْدًا, using it as a verb. (S, I &#39;Ak * p. 169.) And sometimes one says, قَامَ القَوْمُ مَا حَاشَى زَيْدًا [<i>The party stood, except Zeyd</i>]; (Mughnee, I&#39; Ak p. 169;) like مَا خَلَا; though Ibn-Málik [like Sb] disallows it: (I&#39; Ak:) this being shown to be allowable by the saying of the poet, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        رَاَيْتُ النَّاسَ مَا حَاشَى قُرَيْشًا<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        فَاـِنَّا نَحْنُ اَفْضَلُهُمْ فَعَالَا<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>I have seen mankind, except Kureysh, that we are the most excellent of them in conduct</i>]. (Mughnee, I&#39; Ak p. 170.) The agent of حاشى [used as a verb having but one tense and no inf. n.] is a pronoun implied, relating to the inf. n. of the preceding verb, or to its act. part. n., or to a portion of what is meant by the [preceding] general noun: so that when one says, قَامَ القَوْمُ حَاشَى <br>\
                  زَيْدًا, the meaning is, [<i>The party stood,</i> but] <i>their standing,</i> or <i>the stander of them,</i> or <i>a portion of them, was apart from Zeyd.</i> (Mughnee.) [In the K, its use as a verb of this kind is not mentioned; but it is there said to govern the gen. case, like حَتَّى.] ―         -b3-  It also denotes remoteness from imperfection or the like, or freedom therefrom; as in the phrase للّٰهِ ↓ <br>\
      حَاشَى [<i>I ascribe unto God remoteness from every imperfection</i> or <i>the like,</i> or <i>freedom therefrom;</i> generally implying wonder or admiration, so that it may be rendered, <i>how</i> <br>\
                  <i>far,</i> or <i>how free, is God from every imperfection!</i>]: (Mughnee:) or this phrase means مَعَاذَ اْللّٰهِ [<i>I seek protection by God;</i> or, as often used by late writers, and in the present day, <i>God forbid!</i>]; as also للّٰهِ ↓ <br>\
      حَاشَ; (S, K;) <i>the former being the original expression:</i> (S:) it occurs, read in both these ways, in the Kur xii. 31 and 51; where it implies wonder at the power of God as manifested in the creation of such a person as Joseph. (Ksh, Bd.) Mbr and IJ and the Koofees hold that it is a verb; and that, in the [latter] verse the meaning is, Joseph <i>hath kept aloof from disobedience for the sake of God;</i> but such an interpretation as this is not suitable in the case of [the former verse,] حَاشَ للّٰهِ مَا هٰذَا <br>\
                  بَشَرًا: the truth is, that it is a noun, syn. with التَنْزِيه or البَرَا=ءَة, [accord. to different copies of the Mughnee, meaning تَنْزِيهًا or بَرَا=ءَةً,] as is shown by another reading, للّٰهِ ↓ <br>\
      حَاشًا, with tenween, like بَرَا=ءَةً للّٰهِ; and by the reading of Ibn-Mes&#39;ood, اْللّٰهِ ↓ <br>\
      حَاشَ, like مَعَاذَ اْللّٰهِ: some assert that it is a verbal noun, meaning اَتَبَرَّاُ [<i>I assert myself to be free,</i> or <i>clear,</i> to God], or تَبَرَّاْتُ [<i>I have asserted myself</i> &amp;amp;c.]; but its being decl. in some dials. contradicts this. (Mughnee.) One says also, ↓ <br>\
      حَاشَاكَ and لَكَ ↓ <br>\
      حَاشَى [<i>Far art thou</i> from being included among those of whom I speak! or from any cause of reproach! or the like]; both meaning the same. (S, K.) And some of the Arabs say ↓ <br>\
      حَشَى, (Fr, IAmb, TA,) dropping the ا (IAmb, TA.) ―         -b4-  Sb says, (S, Mughnee,) with most of the Basrees, (Mughnee,) that it is only a particle governing the gen. case, (S, Mughnee,) syn. with اـِلَّا; (Mughnee;) because, if it were a verb, it would be allowable to make it a connective to مَا, like خَلَا; and this he asserts to be not allowable. (S.) Mbr says that it is sometimes a verb; as is shown by the verse of En-Nábighah cited above; and by the saying حَاشَى لِزَيْدٍ, because a particle cannot be made to precede immediately another particle; and because it suffers elision, as in the phrase حَاشَ لِزَيْدٍ, seeing that elision takes place in nouns and verbs only, exclusively of particles: (S, Mughnee *:) and IJ and the Koofees say the like: but Mbr also holds, in common with El-Jarmee and El-Mázinee and Zj and Akh and AZ and Fr and Aboo-&#39;Amr EshSheybánee, that it is often a particle governing the gen. case, and seldom a trans. verb having but one tense and no inf. n., because syn. with اـِلَّا.
