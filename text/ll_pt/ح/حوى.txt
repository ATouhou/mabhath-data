(Mgh: in which, and in the S, the foregoing verse is cited as an ex. of this last meaning.) التَّحِيَّاتُ لِلّٰهِ means <i>Endless existence belongs to God:</i> (Lth, Msb, TA:) or <i>dominion,</i> or <i>kingship:</i> (Lth, Yaakoob, S, Msb, TA:) or <i>freedom,</i> or <i>security, from all evils,</i> (Khálid Ibn-Yezeed, AHeyth,) and <i>from all causes of the cessation of existence:</i> (AHeyth:) or <i>endless existence, and security from evils, and dominion, and the like:</i> (Fr:) or <i>the expressions</i> [<i>of praise</i>] <i>that indicate and imply the ascription of dominion and endless existence:</i> (Kt:) or <i>salutations and benedictions are Gods, and at his disposal.</i> (Mgh.) [التَّحِيَّاتُ is also a term applied to the following form of words repeated in the ordinary prayers: التَّحِيَّاتُ لِلّٰهِ وَالصَّلَوَاتُ <br>\
