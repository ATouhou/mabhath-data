AZ says that in all verbs coordinate to استحوذ, the original letters of the root may be preserved: that the Arabs say اِسْتَصَابَ and اِسْتَصْوَبَ, and اِسْتَجَابَ and اِسْتَجْوَبَ: and that their doing so is agreeable with a rule constantly obtaining with them. (S.) The grammarians say that he who says حَاذَ, aor. يَحُوذُ, says only استحاذ; and he who says اَحْوَذَ, says in like manner استحوذ.
