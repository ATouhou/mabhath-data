                  , (S, K,) and شَعَرَهُ, (S, M, Msb,) aor.      <br>\
                     حَلِقَ<br>\
                  , (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. حَلْقٌ (S, * M, Msb, K) and حِلَاقٌ (S, * Msb, K *) and تَحْلَاقٌ, (S, * K,) <i>He removed the hair of his head</i> [<i>with a razor,</i> or <i>shaved his head</i>], (K,) [and <i>he shaved off his hair;</i>] as also ↓ <br>\
      احتلقهُ; (S, K;) and ↓ <br>\
      حلّقهُ, (K,) inf. n. تَحْلِيقٌ: (TA:) or the latter verb has an intensive signification, (O, Msb,) and applies to many objects, (S, Msb,) as in the phrase, حَلَّقُوا <br>\
                  رُوُوسَهُمْ [<i>they shaved their heads</i>]: (S:) and you say also, حَلَقَ مَعْزَهُ [<i>he shore his goats</i>]; but not جَزَّ save in the case of sheep: (S:) [for] الحَلْقُ with respect to the hair of human beings and of goats is like الجَزُّ with respect to wool. (M, TA.) [Hence,] اـِنَّ رَاْسَهُ لَجَيِّدُ الحِلَاقِ [<i>Verily his head is well shaven</i>]. (S, K. *) And يَوْمُ تَحْلَاق <br>\
                  اللَّمَمِ [<i>The day of the shaving off of the locks termed</i> <br>\
                  لمم]; which was a day fought by Teghlib (S, K) against Bekr Ibn-Wáïl; (S;) because their [i. e. Teghlib&#39;s] distinctive sign was shaving (الحَلْق), (S, K,) on that day. (S.) ―         -b2-  عَقْرًا حَلْقًا, or ↓ <br>\
      عَقْرَى حَلْقَى, (S, K, *) is an expression occurring in a trad.: (S:) the latter is rare; or is an incorrect variation of the relaters of traditions: (K:) A &#39;Obeyd says, it is عَقْرًا حَلْقًا, for which the relaters of traditions say ↓ <br>\
      عَقْرَى حَلْقَى; and the original form and meaning is عَقَرَهَا اْللّٰهُ وَحَلَقَهَا, (S,) or عَقَرَهَا اْللّٰهُ عَقْرًا وَحَلَقَهَا حَلْقًا, (TA,) i. e., [accord. to A &#39;Obeyd,] <i>May God wound her body, and afflict her with pain in her</i> <br>\
                  حَلْق [or <i>fauces</i>]: (S, K: *) but this explanation is not valid: accord. to the T, it is a form of imprecation uttered against a woman, [not in earnest, though denoting a degree of displeasure,] meaning <i>may she be bereft of her husband,</i> or <i>became a widow, so that she shall shave off her hair:</i> and Az says that عَقْرَى ↓ <br>\
      حَلْقَى means <i>she is unlucky</i> [<i>to others</i>] <i>and annoying:</i> ISd says, it is said to mean <i>she is unlucky</i> [<i>to others</i>]; but I am not sure of it. (TA.) Accord. to Aboo-Nasr (S, TA) Ahmad Ibn-Hátim, (S,) one says on the occasion of an event at which one wonders, خَمْشَى ↓ <br>\
      عَقْرَى حَلْقَى, as though [meaning <i>May she</i> who has occasioned this, <i>scratch and wound her face, and shave off her hair:</i>] from الحَلْقُ [the act of shaving] and العَقْرُ [the act of wounding] and الخَمْشُ syn. with الخَدْشُ [the act of scratching]: (S, TA: *) and he cites this verse: <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L>↓ <br>\
      اَلَا قَوْمِى اُولُو عَقْرَى وَحَلْقَى<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        لِمَا لَا قَتْ سَلَامَانُ بْنُ غَنْمِ<br>\
                  </quote> (TA, and so in some copies of the S,) meaning [<i>Now surely</i>] <i>my people have women who have wounded and scratched their faces and shaven off their hair</i> [<i>on account of what</i> the tribe of <i>Selámán Ibn-Ghanm has experienced</i>]: so, says IB, IKtt relates this verse, and so Hr in the Ghareebeyn: but ISk, thus: <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        اَلَا قَوْمِى اـِلَى عَقْرَى وَحَلْقَى<br>\
                  </quote> [and so I find it in one copy of the S:] and IJ explains it by saying that عقرى وحلقى originally denotes the case of a woman who, when some one honourable in her estimation has been smitten, or wounded, takes a pair of sandals, and beats with them her head, and wounds or scratches it, and shaves off her hair; and the poet means, <i>my people have come to the condition of wounded,</i> or <i>scratched, and shaven, women.</i> (TA.) [Fei says,] حَلْقًا لَهُ وَعَقْرًا is a form of imprecation, meaning <i>May God afflict him with pain in his</i> <br>\
                  حَلْق [or <i>fauces</i>], <i>and wound his body:</i> but the relaters of traditions say عَقْرَى ↓ <br>\
      حَلْقَى, with the fem. alif, making them act. part. ns.; [the former meaning, accord. to one of the explanations given above, an <i>unlucky</i> woman <i>to others,</i> though this is doubtful; and] the latter meaning a woman <i>annoying</i> her people: (Msb:) or both these words are inf. ns., like دَعْوَى. (TA in art. عقر. [See more in that art]) ―         -b3-  They said also, بَيْنَهُمُ <br>\
                  اْحْلِقِى وَقُومِى [<i>Among them is</i> heard the saying, <i>Shave,</i> O woman, <i>and arise</i>]; i. e. <i>among them is trial,</i> or <i>trouble, and distress, affliction, calamity,</i> or <i>adversity:</i> and يُوْمُ اْحْلِقِى وَقُومِى [<i>A day of</i> the saying <i>Shave,</i> &amp;amp;c.; i. e., <i>of trial,</i> &amp;amp;c.].

                  , inf. n. حلْقٌ, <i>He peeled the thing;</i> or <i>stripped off,</i> or <i>otherwise removed, its superficial part:</i> or <i>he peeled, stripped, pared, scraped,</i> or <i>rubbed, off the thing:</i> syn. قَشَرَهُ. (TA.) ―         -b5-  And حَلَقَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He,</i> or <i>it, destroyed;</i> and <i>cut off entirely,</i> like as the razor does hair. (TA.) ―         -b6-  And, aor. as above, (assumed tropical:)  <i>He</i> (a man) <i>pained,</i> or <i>caused to suffer pain.</i> (IAar,  TA.)       -A2-  حَلَقَهُ, (S, K,) aor.      <br>\

                  حَلْق [or <i>fauces</i>]; (S, K;) a verb similar to رَاَسَهُ, and عَضَدَهُ and صَدَرَهُ, meaning “ he struck his head ” and “ his upper arm ” and “ his breast: ” and <i>He</i> (God) <i>afflicted him with pain in his</i> <br>\
                  حَلْق; as explained in a phrase mentioned above. (S.) ―         -b2-  And (tropical:)  <i>He filled it,</i> namely, a watering-trough or tank, (K, TA,) <i>up to its</i> <br>\
