      اُحْدُوثَةٌ signifies <i>a thing that is talked of, told,</i> or <i>narrated:</i> (S, K:) or this last signifies <i>a wonderful thing:</i> (IB, TA:) it has been asserted, says MF, that there is no difference between احدوثة and حديث in usage, and in denoting <i>what is good</i> and <i>what is evil;</i> in contradiction to such as say that the former peculiarly signifies <i>that</i> [<i>kind of story</i>] <i>in which there is no profit nor any truth;</i> such as amatory stories, and the like fictions of the Arabs: Fr asserts it to signify peculiarly <i>a laughable and an absurd story;</i> differing from حديث: and Ibn-Hishám El-Lakhmee, in his Expos of the Fs, says that it is only used to denote <i>what is bad,</i> or <i>evil:</i> but Lb replies against him, in his Expos., that it is sometimes used to denote <i>what is good;</i> as in a saying mentioned by Yaakoob, which see below: (TA:) the pl. of حَدِيثٌ is اَحَادِيثُ, contr. to analogy, (S, K,) said by Fr to be pl. of ↓ <br>\
      اُحْدُوثَةٌ, and then used as pl. of حديث, (S,) but IB says that this is not the case; (TA;) and حِدْثَانٌ and حُدْثَانٌ are also pls. of حديث, (K, TA,) sometimes occurring; the latter, rare. (TA.) You say, سَمِعْتُ حَدِيثًا حَسَنًا (TA) and حَسَنَةً ↓ <br>\
