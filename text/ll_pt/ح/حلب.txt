                  <i>I have milked her</i> &amp;amp;c., meaning I have taken it by force when I could not by gentle means. (TA in art. شد.)

                  <i>If thou lie, mayest thou milk sitting;</i> i. e., lose thy camels, and become an owner only of sheep or goats, and thus, after having milked camels standing, milk sheep or goats sitting: this, also, is a proverbial saying, like the following: مَا لَهُ حَلَبَ قَاعِدًا وَاْصْطَبَحَ بَارِدًا [<i>What aileth him?</i>] <i>May he</i> [be reduced to] <i>milk</i> a sheep or goat <i>sitting, and drink cold</i> water, not hot milk.

You say, اُحْلُبْ وَكُلْ (tropical:)  [<i>Kneel thou like the milker, and eat</i>]: (A:) it denotes a lowly [and becoming] mode of sitting while eating. (TA.) لَيْسَ فِى كُلِّ حِينٍ اْحْلُبْ <br>\
                  فَاْشْرُبْ (tropical:)  [<i>Not at every time</i> is it said, <i>kneel thou, and understand</i>] is a prov. applied in the case of anything that is forbidden, or denied: AA says that الحلب signifies <i>the act of kneeling;</i> and الشرب <br>\
                  <i>the understanding</i> a thing: and one says to a stupid person, اُحْلُبْ ثُمَّ اْشْرُبْ <br>\
