                  , is a verb mentioned by IKoot and IKtt and others, as derived from حَتْفٌ signifying “ death, ” though J says that no verb is formed from this word; as IF and Meyd and Az also assert: (MF, TA:) and حُتُوفٌ is its inf. n., as well as pl. of حَتْفٌ: [accord. to SM, it is intrans., signifying <i>He died;</i> for he says,] hence the saying in the A, المَرْءُ يَسْعَى وَيَطُوفُ <br>\
                  وَعَاقِبَتُهُ الحُتُوفُ [<i>Man labours, and goes about: and his end is dying</i>]. (TA.) [But see what follows.]       -A2-  IF says that no verb is formed from حَتْفٌ signifying “ death; ” and so, after him, J; and Az says that he had heard no such verb: but IKoot mentions حَتَفَهُ, aor.      <br>\
                     حَتِفَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. حَتْفٌ, as signifying <i>He,</i> or <i>it, killed him;</i> or <i>caused him to die.</i> (Msb.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>Death:</i> (S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.:) pl. حُتُوفٌ. (S, K.) You say, مَاتَ حَتْفَ اَنْفِهِ, (A &#39;Obeyd, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and حَتْفَ فِيهِ, but this is rare, and حَتْفَ اَنْفَيْهِ, (K,) which may mean مَنْخِرَيْهِ, or it may mean اَنْفه وَفَمه, the انف being made predominant, (TA,) <i>He died upon his bed;</i> (A &#39;Obeyd, Mgh, Msb, K;) [<i>a natural death;</i>] <i>respiring until he yielded his last breath;</i> (Msb;) <i>not from slaughter, nor beating,</i> (A &#39;Obeyd, S, Msb, K,) <i>nor drowning, nor burning,</i> (A &#39;Obeyd, Sgh, Msb, K,) <i>nor by a wild beast, &amp;amp;c.:</i> (A &#39;Obeyd, TA:) the nose is particularized as meaning that the spirit passes forth from it with the breath; or because they imagined that the spirit of the sick man passes forth from his nose, and that of the wounded man from his wound; (IAth, K;) or because the spirit passes forth from the mouth and the nose, and the latter of these is made predominant: (O, TA:) and حتف is put in the accus. case in the manner of an inf. n. (TA.) This phrase was used in the time of paganism, by Es-Semow-al: (Msb, TA:) or, accord. to some, in the phrase attributed to him, the right reading is not مات حتف انفه, but مات فِى فِرَاشِهِ; and the former was first used by Mohammad. (Ham p. 52.) It is said of a human being: (S, Mgh:) and then of any animal when it dies without any accidental cause: (Mgh:) hence, of a fish that has died, and floats upon the water. (Msb, TA.) It is said in a trad. of &#39;Ámir Ibn-Fuheyreh, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَالمَرْءُ يَاْتِى حَتْفُهُ مِنْ فَوْقِهِ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>And man, his death comes from above him</i>]: meaning that his caution and his cowardice will not repel from him the decree of death when it befalls him: originally said by &#39;Amr Ibn-Mámeh. (L, TA.)       -A2-  حَيَّةٌ حَتْفَةٌ [<i>A dead serpent</i>] is a phrase like اِمْرَاَةٌ عَدْلَةٌ: (Z, TA:) the latter word is here an epithet. (Z, K.)   </entryFree> <br>\
