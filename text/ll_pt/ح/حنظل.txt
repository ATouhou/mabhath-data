                   [The <i>colocynth; cucumis colocynthis;</i>] <i>a certain bitter plant;</i> (Msb;) [and <i>its fruit;</i>] <i>well known;</i> (K;) <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  شَرْىٌ: (S:) n. un. with ة: (S, Msb, K: *) [accord. to Freytag (who refers to Avic. p. 175, and Sprengel. hist. rei herb. vol. i. p. 269,) applied also to the <i>momordica elaterium,</i> or <i>cucumis prophetarum:</i>] <i>there is a male species, and a female; the former fibrous; the latter soft,</i> or <i>easily broken, white, and easy to swallow:</i> (TA:) <i>the choice sort of it is the yellow;</i> (K;) or, accord. to the “ Kánoon ” of the Ra-ees [Ibn-Seenà, from which the description of its properties and uses, in the K and TA, is, with some slight variations, taken], <i>the white, very white, and soft; for the black and the hard are bad, and it is not plucked until it becomes yellow, and the greenness has completely gone from it;</i> (TA:) <i>its pulp attenuates the thick phlegmatic humour that flows upon the joints</i> (K, TA) <i>and tendons,</i> (TA,) <i>when swallowed</i> (K, TA) <i>in the dose of of twelve keeráts,</i> (TA,) <i>or used in the manner of a cluster: it is beneficial for melancholy, and epilepsy, and the</i> [<i>sort of doting termed</i>] وَسْوَاس, <i>and alopecia</i> (دَا=ء الثَّعْلَب), <i>and elephantiasis</i> (الجُذَام), (K, TA,) <i>and</i> [<i>the disease of the tumid leg, termed</i>] دَا=ء الفِيل; <i>for these three used by rubbing; and for the cold</i> <br>\
                  نِقْرِس [i. e. <i>arthritis,</i> or <i>gout</i>], (TA,) <i>and for the bite of vipers, and the sting of scorpions, especially its root;</i> (K, TA;) <i>for this last being the most beneficial of medicines; a drachm of its root, administered to an Arab stung by a scorpion in four places, being said to have cured him on the spot: that which is plucked green relaxes</i> [<i>the bowels</i>] <i>excessively, and produces excessive vomiting:</i> so in the “ Kánoon: ” (TA:) <i>it is also beneficial for the tooth-ache, by fumigating with its seeds; and for killing fleas, by sprinkling what is cooked thereof; and for the sciatica, by rubbing with what is green thereof:</i> (K, TA:) <i>its root is cooked with vinegar, and one rinses the mouth with it for the tooth-ache; and the vinegar is cooked in it in hot ashes: when cooked in olive-oil, that oil, being dropped</i> [<i>into the ear-hole</i>], <i>is beneficial for ringing in the ears: it is beneficial also for the moist and flatulent colic: and sometimes it attenuates the blood: administered as a suppository in the vagina, it kills the fœtus:</i> (TA:) <i>when the plant bears a single fruit, this is very deadly.</i> (K, TA.) [See also هَبِيدٌ.] Accord. to [many of] the leading authorities among the Arabs, (TA,) the ن in this word is augmentative; (Msb, TA;) because of their saying, حَظِلَ البَعِيرُ, meaning “ the camel became sick from eating حَنْظَل; ” and J and Sgh [and Fei and others] have mentioned it in art. حظل: but ISd says that this is not an evidence of its being radically triliteral; and that حَظِلَ is  like ضَغْبَةٌ (as an epithet applied to a woman) from الضَّغَابِيسُ, which must be acknowledged to be radically quadriliteral.
