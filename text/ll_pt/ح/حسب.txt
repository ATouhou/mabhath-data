                  , (S, Mgh, Msb, &amp;amp;c.,) inf. n. حَسْبٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and حُسْبَانٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and حِسْبَانٌ (K) and حِسَابٌ (S, K,) which is generally an inf. n. of this verb, but sometimes of حَاسَبَ, (TA,) and حِسَابَةٌ (S, K) and حِسْبَةٌ, (Msb, K,) or this is like قِعْدَةٌ and رِكْبَةٌ, [denoting a mode, or manner,] as in a verse of En-Nábighah cited below, (S,) and حَسْبَةٌ, which is of rare occurrence, (MF, TA,) <i>He numbered, counted, reckoned, calculated,</i> or <i>computed, it;</i> (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) namely, property [&amp;amp;c.]. (A, Mgh, Msb.) You say, مَنْ يَقْدِرُ عَلَى عَدِّ الرَّمْلِ وَحَسْبِ الحَصَى [<i>Who can count the sands, and number the pebbles?</i>]. (A.) And اَلْقِ هٰذَا فِى الحَسْبِ [<i>Throw thou this into the reckoning</i>]; i. e., <i>into what thou hast reckoned.</i> (A.) وَالشَّمْسُ وَالقَمَرُ بِحُسْبَانٍ, in the Kur [lv. 4], means <i>And the sun and the moon</i> [run their courses] <i>according to a</i> [certain] <i>reckoning;</i> or <i>through a series of mansions</i> [or <i>constellations</i>], the bounds of which they do not transgress: (TA:) or بحسبان alludes to the numbers of the months and years and all other times: [but properly speaking,] حسبان is here an inf. n.: (Zj, TA:) or, accord. to Akh, a pl. of حِسَابٌ; (S, TA;) and so says AHeyth: or, accord. to some, it is here a proper subst., signifying the <i>firmament.</i> (TA.) حُسْبَانًا in the Kur vi. 96 is held by Akh to be for بِحُسْبَانٍ, meaning بِحِسَابٍ [as in the phrase quoted above, from the Kur lv. 4, accord. to the first explanation]. (TA.) And حُسْبَانُكَ عَلَى اْللّٰه signifies حِسَابُكَ على اللّٰه [<i>On</i> <br>\
                  <i>God be it to reckon with thee:</i> see also حَسِيبُكَ <br>\
                  اْللّٰهُ]. (TA.) Az says that the reckoning in buying and selling is termed حِسَابٌ because one knows thereby what is sufficient. (TA.) وَاْللّٰهُ سَرِيعُ <br>\
                  الحِسَابِ, in the Kur [ii. 198, &amp;amp;c., <i>God is quick in reckoning</i>], signifies that his reckoning is necessary, or of necessity, and that his reckoning with one person does not divert Him from reckoning with another. (TA.) And يَرْزُقُ مَنْ يَشَا=ءُ بَغَيْرِ <br>\
                  حِسَابٍ, in the Kur [ii. 208, &amp;amp;c., <i>He supplieth whom He willeth, without reckoning</i>], means <i>without sparing,</i> or <i>scanting;</i> as when a man expends without reckoning: but the phrase is variously explained, as meaning <i>without appointing for any one what is deficient:</i> or <i>without fearing that any one will call Him to account for it:</i> or <i>without the receiver&#39;s thinking that He will bestow upon him,</i> or <i>without his reckoning upon the supply;</i> so that it may be from حَسِبَ “ he thought, ” or from حَسَبَ “ he reckoned. ” (L, TA.) The saying, cited by IAar, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        يَا جُمْلُ اَسْقَاكِ بِلَا حِسَابَهْ<br>\
                  </quote> as related by J [in the S], but correctly اُسْقيت, (TA,) means [<i>O Juml, mayest thou be given rain</i>] <i>without reckoning,</i> and <i>without measure.</i> (S.) An instance of حِسْبَةٌ as similar to قِعْدَةٌ and رِكْبَةٌ occurs in the saying of En-Nábighah, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  غير محسّب being variously rendered: one person prefers the meaning <i>not buried:</i> Az says that the signification of burial in stones and that of wrapping in grave-clothes, assigned to the verb, were unknown to him; and that غير محسّب signifies <i>not supported with a pillow.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

And حَسْبُكَ بِصَدِيقِنَا [<i>A person sufficing thee is our friend</i>]; in which the ب is added to denote emphatic praise. (Fr, TA in art. بِ.) In the saying, هٰذَا رَجُلٌ حَسْبُكَ مِنْ رَجُلٍ <br>\
                  <i>This is a man sufficing thee as a man,</i> i. e. <i>supplying to thee the place of any other</i> [by his excellent qualities], (S, K,) and مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ حَسْبِكَ مِنْ رَجُلٍ <br>\
                  <i>I passed by a man sufficing thee as a man,</i> (TA,) حسبك is an expression of praise, referring to the indeterminate noun [رجل]; because, in its case, [what is originally (see below)] an inf. n. (فِعْلٌ [under which term lexicologists, but not grammarians, include the مَصْدَر]) is rendered, in grammatical analysis, by another word, [i. e., by an act. part. n.,] as though one said مُحْسِبٌ لَكَ, or كَافٍ <br>\
                  لَكَ. (S. [Thus حسبك in these two instances is a صِفَة, i. e. an epithetic phrase; and من رجل is a تَمْيِيز, i. e. a specificative phrase.]) When the noun to which حسبك refers is determinate, you put حسب in the accus. case, as a حال, i. e. a denotative of state; as in the saying, هٰذَا عَبْدُ <br>\
                  اْللّٰهِ حَسْبَكَ مِنْ رَجُلٍ <br>\
                  <i>This is &#39;Abd-Allah; being one sufficing thee as a man.</i> (S. [Here من رجل is, as before, a specificative phrase.]) [See also 4, the corresponding verb.]) حسب, in this manner, is used alike as sing. and dual and pl.; (S, K;) being [originally] an inf. n. (S.) It is also used alone, [as a prefixed noun of which the complement is understood,] as in the phrase زَيْدٌ حَسْبُ, without tenween, for حَسْبِى or حَسْبُكَ [&amp;amp;c., meaning <i>Zeyd is sufficient for me</i> or <i>for thee</i> &amp;amp;c.]; like as one says, جَا=ءَنِى زَيْدٌ لَيْسَ غَيْرُ, for لَيْسَ غَيْرُهُ عِنْدِى. (S. [That is, حَسْبُ, when thus used, is subject to the same rules as غَيْرُ and قَبْلُ, and بَعْدُ &amp;amp;c. when so used.]) ―         -b3-  See also حَسَبٌ, in three places.       -A2-  Also, (TA,) and ↓ <br>\
