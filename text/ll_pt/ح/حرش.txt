                  , inf. n. حَرْشٌ (S, K) and تَحْرَاشٌ, (K,) <i>He hunted,</i> or <i>sought to capture</i> or <i>catch,</i> or <i>captured</i> or <i>caught, the</i> [<i>lizard called</i>] ضبّ; syn. صَادَهُ; (S, A, K;) <i>by moving about his hand at its hole,</i> (S, K,) <i>at the entrance thereof,</i> (K,) <i>in order that it might imagine it to be a serpent, and put forth its tail to strike it, whereupon he would seize it;</i> (S, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      احترشهُ: (A, K:) or, as also ↓ <br>\
      احترشهُ, and ↓ <br>\

      تحرّش, <i>he traced its hole, and made a noise with his staff,</i> or <i>stick, at it, and inserted the end of this into the hole, and the ضبّ, hearing the sound, thought it to be a beast desiring to come in upon it, so it came backwards upon its feet and kinder part, fighting, and striking with its tail, whereupon the man hastened with it, and seized it firmly by its tail, and it was unable to escape from him.</i> (TA.) And hence, <i>He hunted,</i> or <i>sought to capture,</i> or <i>captured, the ضبّ in any manner.</i> (Ham p. 61.) Hence also the saying, لَهُوَ اَخْبَثُ <br>\
                  مِنْ ضَبٍّ حَرَشْتَهُ [<i>Verily he is worse than a ضبّ which thou hast hunted</i>]: for sometimes the ضبّ scents [its pursuer], and circumvents [him], and cannot be caught. (TA.) And hence the prov., alluding to one&#39;s discoursing to a learned man with the desire of instructing him, اَتُعْلِمُنِى بِضَبٍّ <br>\
                  اَنَا حَرَشْتُهُ [<i>Dost thou acquaint me with a</i> <br>\
                  ضبّ <br>\
                  <i>which I have captured?</i>]. (A &#39;Obeyd, Az.) Hence also the prov., هٰذَااَجَلُّ مِنَ الحَرْشِ [<i>This is a greater matter than the hunting,</i> or <i>capturing, of the</i> <br>\
                  ضبّ]: (M, A, K:) originating in one of their fables, to the effect that a ضبّ said to its young one, “ O my little son, beware thou of الحَرْش: ” and the young one heard, one day, the fall of a digging-implement upon the mouth of the hole; so he said, “ O my father, is this الحَرْش? ” to which his father answered, “ O my little son, this is a greater matter than الحَرْش: ” (M, K: *) and it became a prov., which is applied to him who fears a thing and falls into that which is more severe.
