                   [signifying <i>He,</i> or <i>it, was,</i> or <i>became, loved, beloved, an object of love, affected, liked,</i> or <i>approved,</i> is originally حَبُبَ or حَبِبَ]. You say, حَبَّ اـِلَىَّ هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ, [aor.      <br>\

                  <i>I became loved, beloved,</i> or <i>an object of love, to him:</i> [said to be] the only instance of its kind except شَرُرْتُ and لَبُبْتُ. (K.) And مَا كُنْتَ حَبِيبًا وَلَقَدْ حَبِبْتَ, with kesr, <i>Thou wast not loved, and thou hast become loved.</i> (S.) See also 5. ―         -b2-  حَبَّ, formed from حَبُبَ, by making the former ب quiescent and incorporating it into the latter, is also a verb of praise [signifying <i>Beloved, lovely, pleasing, charming,</i> or <i>excellent, is</i> he, or it]; (TA;) and so حُبَّ, [which is more common,] formed from the same, by incorporating the former ب into the latter after transferring the dammeh of the former to the ح.

From this last signification is [said to be] derived the phrase حُبًّا وَكَرَامَةً [pronounced حُبًّا وَكَرَامَهْ, lit. <i>A jarstand and a cover</i> will I give thee, or the like], كرامة signifying the “ cover ” of a jar, (K, TA,) whether of wood or of baked clay. (TA.) [If this be the true derivation, the phrase may have originated from a person&#39;s asking of another the loan or gift of a jar, and the latter&#39;s replying “ Yea; and I will give thee a jar-stand and a cover; ” meaning “ I will do what thou requirest, and more: ” but this phrase is now, and perhaps was in early times, generally used, agreeably with the more common significations of the two words, in the sense assigned above to the phrase حُبَّةً <br>\

                  , meaning حَبِيبٌ, as in the phrase حَبَّذَا <br>\
                  الاَمْرُ [<i>Loved, beloved, affected, loved,</i> or <i>approved, is the thing,</i> or <i>affair;</i> or <i>lovely, charming,</i> or <i>excellent, is it</i>]; (K;) and in حَبَّذَا زَيْدٌ [<i>Loved, beloved,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>is Zeyd</i>]; (S;) is composed <i>of</i> <br>\
                  حَبَّ, (Sb, Fr, S, K,) a verb of praise, in the pret. form, invariable, originally حَبُبَ, (Fr, S,) and ذَا, (Sb, Fr, S, K,) its agent, (S,) which together constitute it a single word, (Sb, S, K,) a noun, (Sb, K,) or occupying the place of a noun, (S,) governing the noun [particularized by praise] that follows it in the nom. case; (Sb, S, K;) the place that it occupies in construction making it virtually in the nom. case as an inchoative, and the noun that follows it being its enunciative: (S:) [but see what follows.] It is used in the same manner as a prov.; (Sb, K;) [i. e., it is not altered to agree in number or gender with the noun particularized by praise, which follows it;] remaining the same when used in the dual and pl. and fem. sense; so that one says, حبّذا زَيْدٌ and الزَّيْدَانِ and الزَّيْدُونَ and هِنْدٌ and اَنْتَ and اَنْتُمَا and اَنْتُمْ [&amp;amp;c.]; (Ibn-Keysán, TA;) and حبّذا اْمْرَاَةٌ, not حَبَّذِهِ <br>\
                  المَرْاَةُ; (Sb, S, K; *) which shows that the noun that follows it may not be regarded as a substitute for ذا: (S:) [but see what follows.] It is allowable, but bad, to say, زَيْدٌ حَبَّذَا. (TA.) [There are, however, various opinions respecting حبّذا and the noun that follows it.] Some hold that حبّذا is a noun, composed of حَبَّ and ذا, and is an inchoative, and that the noun particularized by praise is its enunciative; or that the former is an enunciative, and the latter an inchoative, reversing the usual order: others hold that حَبَّ is a verb in the pret. form; and ذا, its agent; and that the noun particularized by praise may be an inchoative, of which حبّذا is the enunciative; or it may be an enunciative of which the inchoative is suppressed, so that حبّذا زَيْدٌ is for حبّذا هُوَ زَيْدٌ [<i>Loved,</i> or <i>beloved,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>is this</i> person: <i>he is Zeyd</i>], or حبّذا المَمْدُوحُ زَيْدٌ [<i>loved,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>is this</i> person: <i>the</i> person <i>praised is Zeyd</i>]: others hold that حبّذا is a pret. verb, composed of حَبَّ and ذا, and that the noun following it is its agent; but this is the weakest of opinions: one also says, in dispraise, لَاحَبَّذَا زَيْدٌ.
