And يُحْمَلُ <br>\
                  عَلَى نَقِيضِهِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>It</i> (a word) <i>is made to accord in form with its contrary in meaning:</i> thus عِجَافٌ, an anomalous pl. of اَعْحَفُ, is made to accord. in form with سِمَانٌ, a regular pl. of سَمِينٌ.

                  اللَّفْظِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>It is made to accord syntactically with its grammatical character:</i> the former is said when, in a sentence, we make a mase. word fem., and the contrary, because the meaning allows us to substitute a fem. syn. for the masc. word, and a masc. syn. for the fem. word: for ex., it is said in the Kur vi. 78, فَلَمَّا رَاَى الشَّمْسَ بَازِغَةً قَالَ هٰذَا <br>\
                  رَبِّى “ And when he saw the sun rising, he said, This is my Lord: ” here (by saying بازغة) الشمس is first made to accord syntactically with its grammatical character (تُحْمَلُ عَلَى اللَّفْظِ); and then (by saying هٰذَا instead of هٰذِهِ) it is made to accord syntactically with its meaning (تُحْمَلُ عَلَى <br>\
                  المَعْنَى), which is الجِرْم or the like: this is allowable; but the reverse in respect of order is of weak authority; because the meaning is of more importance than the grammatical character of the word. (Collected from the Kull pp. 156 and 157, and other works.)] ―         -b21-  حَمَلَهُ اَحْسَنَ مَحْيَلٍ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He put the best construction upon it;</i> namely, a saying: محمل being here an inf. n.].
