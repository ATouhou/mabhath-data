                  , inf. n. حَبَطٌ, (Az, S, K, &amp;amp;c.,) <i>He</i> (a beast, Az, S, or a camel, ISd, K) <i>ate much,</i> (S,) or <i>had pain in his belly from pasture which he found unwholesome,</i> or <i>from eating much of herbage,</i> (ISd, K,) <i>so that he became swollen,</i> or <i>inflated, thereby</i> (S, ISd, K) <i>in his belly,</i> (S,) <i>and there would not come forth from him</i> (S, ISd, K) <i>what was in it,</i> (S,) or <i>anything;</i> <br>\
                   (ISd, K;) <i>he did not void either thin dung or urine, his belly being bound:</i> (Az:) or <i>he</i> (a sheep, or goat, ISk, S) <i>became swollen,</i> or <i>inflated, in his belly, in consequence of eating</i> [<i>the herb called</i>] ذُرَق, (ISk, S, K, *) <i>which is the</i> <br>\
                  حَنْدَ قُوق [i. e. the herb <i>lotus, melilot,</i> or <i>bird&#39;s-foot-trefoil</i>]: (ISk, S:) or <i>he</i> (a beast) <i>lighted upon good pasturage, and ate immoderately, so that he became swollen,</i> or <i>inflated, and died:</i> (Z, IAth:) or, in speaking of a horse, you do not say, حَبِطَ الفَرَسُ, but حَبِطَ قُصَيْرَى الفَرَسِ, or خَاصِرَتُهُ, or مَوْقِفُهُ, because it means that <i>the horse&#39;s belly became swollen,</i> or <i>inflated:</i> (ISd, Z, L:) you say also, حَبِطَ بَطْنُهُ <br>\
                  <i>his belly became swollen,</i> or <i>inflated, so that he died:</i> (Az, TA:) or <i>his</i> (a man&#39;s) <i>belly became swollen,</i> or <i>inflated, by food &amp;amp;c.:</i> (Mbr, TA in art. حبطا:) and حَبِطَ is also said of the skin, meaning <i>it became swollen,</i> or <i>inflated.</i> (TA.) [See also Q. Q. 3; and see حَبَطٌ below.] ―         -b2-  Hence, app., i. e. from حَبِطَ said of the belly, (Az, TA,) or it is from this verb said of a beast, (Z, IAth, TA,) حَبِطَ عَمَلُهُ, (Az, S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.,) aor.      <br>\
                     حَبَطَ<br>\

                  ; (AZ, Az, Msb, K;) the latter, says Az, heard by AZ from an Arab of the desert, but I have not heard it on any other authority; (TA;) inf. n. حَبْطٌ, (Az, S, K, [but in the Msb it seems to be indicated that it is حَبَطٌ,]) with the ب quiescent, (Az, S,) thus differing from the inf. n. of حَبِطَ said of the belly, (Az, TA,) and حُبُوطٌ, (Az, S, Msb, K,) which latter, accord. to AZ, is the inf. n. of حَبَطَ like ضَرَبَ; (T, TA;) (tropical:)  <i>His work,</i> or <i>deed, became null,</i> or <i>void,</i> or <i>of no account; it went for nothing; it perished;</i> (Az, Msb, TA;) for like as he of whom one says حَبِطَ بَطْنُهُ perishes, so does the work, or deed, of the hypocrite: (Az, TA:) or <i>it became ineffective of reward; its reward became annulled.</i> (S, K.) And hence also, (Z, TA,) حَبِطَ دَمُهُ, aor.      <br>\
                     حَبَطَ<br>\
                  , (Z, Msb, K, TA,) but not حَبَطَ also, as is implied in the K, (TA,) and in this case the inf. n. is حَبَطٌ, (Msb, * TA,) with the ب movent, (TA,) (tropical:)  <i>His blood</i> (the blood of one slain, K) <i>went for nothing; unretaliated, and uncompensated by a mulct.</i> (Msb, K, TA.) ―         -b3-  حَبِطَ said of the water of a well, <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  اَحْبَطَ, q. v. (TA.) ―         -b4-  Said of a wound, (S, Ibn-&#39; Abbád, K,) aor.      <br>\
                     حَبَطَ<br>\
                  , (K,) inf. n. حَبَطٌ, with fet-h to the ب, (S, K,) <i>It had scars remaining after having healed:</i> (Ibn-&#39; Abbád, K: *) or <i>it broke open again;</i> or <i>became recrudescent;</i> syn. عَرِبَ [which has the signification given above on the authority of Ibn-&#39; Abbád as well as what follows it] and نُكِسَ. (S.) [See also حَبَطٌ below.]    </entryFree> <br>\
                     اَحْبَطَ<br>\

So it signifies in the Kur [xxxiii. 19, &amp;amp;c.]: and you say, اـِنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا اَتْبَعَهُ مَا <br>\
                  يُحْبِطُهُ وَ اـِنْ اَرْسَلَ كَلِمًا طَيِّبًا اَرْسَلَ خَلْفَهُ مَا يُحْبِطُهُ (tropical:)  [<i>If he do a good deed, he makes to follow it that which annuls it; and if he send forth good words, he sends forth after them that which annuls them</i>]. (TA.) And hence also, (Z, TA,) احبط الدَّمَ (tropical:)  <i>He made the blood to go for nothing; unretaliated, and uncompensated by a mulct.</i> (Msb, K, * TA. *) ―         -b3-  احبطهُ الضَّرْبُ <br>\

      حُبَيْطٍ, with kesr to the ط, and with tenween; for the ا is not to denote the fem. gender, that the letter preceding it should be with fet-h, as in [حُبَيْلَى and بُشَيْرَى] the dims. of حُبْلَى and بُشْرَى: you may also retain the ن, and reject the ا; saying ↓ <br>\
      حُبَيْنِطٌ: and thus you may do in the case of any noun having two letters added for the purpose of quasi-coordination: you may also put a compensation for the letter rejected in either place, or not: if you put a compensation in the former instance, you say ↓ <br>\
