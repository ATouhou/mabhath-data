      حَرَارَةٌ as a simple subst., or as an inf. n., but more probably as the former, is حَرَارَاتٌ.

(Msb.) Omar said to the women who used to go forth to the mosque, لَاَرُدَّنَّكْنَّ حَرَايِرَ [lit. <i>I will assuredly make you to become free women</i>]; meaning <i>I will assuredly make you to keep to the houses</i>: for the curtain is lowered before free women; not before slavewomen.

(K, TA.) [Hence,] بَاتَتْ بِلَيْلَةِ حُرَّةٍ (tropical:)  [<i>She passed a virgin&#39;s night</i>] is said of her whose husband has not been able to devirginate her (S, A, K) in the night when she has been first brought to him: (TA:) because the حُرَّة is modest and repugnant: (Har p. 418:) in the contr. case one says, بِلَيْلَةِ شَيْبَا=ءَ: (S, L:) and one says also بِلَيْلَةٍ حُرَّةٍ; and بِلَيْلَةٍ شَيْبَا=ءَ. (TA.) [And hence,] لَيْلَةُ حُرَّة and لَيْلَةٌ حُرَّةٌ signify also (assumed tropical:)  <i>The first night of the</i> [<i>lunar</i>] <i>month</i>: (K:) its last night is called لَيْلَةُ شَيْبَا=ءَ and لَيْلَةٌ <br>\

You say, مَاهٰذَا مِنْكَ بِحُرٍّ (tropical:)  <i>This is not good,</i> or <i>well, of thee.</i> (S, A.) ―         -b5-  (assumed tropical:)  Anything <i>good,</i> or <i>excel-lent;</i> as poetry, &amp;amp;c.

                  ساق حرّ]: on which IJ observes, As says, ساق حرّ is thought to mean the young one of the bird; but it is her <i>cry:</i> and he (IJ) adds, the fact that the poet [Sakhr] does not make it decl. is an evidence of the correctness of the assertion of As; for, were it decl., he would have said سَاقَ حُرٍّ if it consisted of two nouns whereof the former was prefixed to the other so as to govern it in the gen. case, or ساق حُرًّا if it were a compound; as it is indeterminate: and its being made decl. by Homeyd does not show it to be not significant of a sound; for sometimes an expression significant of a sound consists of two nouns whereof the former is prefixed to the latter so as to govern it in the gen. case, like خَازُ بَازٍ.
