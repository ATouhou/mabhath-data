You say also, جَعَلْتُمُ الاَرْضَ عَلَيْهِ حَيْصَ بَيْصَ, (S and K, both in art. بيص,) or حِيصَ بِيصَ, (S ubi suprà,) and حَيْصًا بَيْصًا, (ISk, and K ubi suprà,) with fet-h to each, and حِيصًا بِيصًا, with kesr to each, not compounded, (ISk, and TA ubi suprà,) <i>Ye have straitened</i> [<i>the earth,</i> or <i>land,</i>] <i>to him,</i> (S and K ubi suprà,) <i>so that he may not act as he pleases therein:</i> (K:) or <i>so that he may not travel therein in search of sustenance, nor employ himself as he would to make gain.</i> (Nh.) And اـِنَّكَ لَتَحْسِبُ عَلَىَّ الاَرْضَ حَيْصًا بَيْصًا, or, as some say, حيصِ بيصِ, [i. e., حَيْصِ بَيْصِ or حِيصِ بِيصِ, meaning, <i>Verily thou thinkest the earth to be straitened to me, so that I may not act as I please therein:</i> &amp;amp;c.] (S.) ―         -b2-  حَيْصَ بَيْصَ also signifies <i>The hole of the rat</i> or <i>mouse.</i> (TA in art. بيص.)    </entryFree> <br>\
