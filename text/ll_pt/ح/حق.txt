                  صَارَ حَقًّا [i. e., accord. to the primary meaning of حَقٌّ, as explained below, on the authority of Er-Rághib, <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, suitable to the requirements of wisdom, justice, right</i> or <i>rightness, truth,</i> or <i>reality</i> or <i>fact;</i> or <i>to the exigencies of the case</i>]: (TA:) <i>it was,</i> or <i>became, just, proper, right, correct,</i> or <i>true; authentic, genuine, sound, valid, substantial,</i> or <i>real; established,</i> or <i>confirmed, as a truth</i> or <i>fact:</i> and <i>necessitated, necessary, requisite,</i> or <i>unavoidable; binding, obligatory, incumbent,</i> or <i>due:</i> syn. وَجَبَ; (T, S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.;) and ثَبَتَ: (Msb, TA:) <i>it was,</i> or <i>became, a manifest and an indubitable fact</i> or <i>event;</i> as explained by IDrd in the Jm; (TA;) <i>it happened, betided,</i> or <i>befell, surely, without doubt</i> or <i>uncertainty.</i> (K.) It is said in the Kur xxxvi. 6, لَقَدْ حَقَّ القَوْلُ عَلَى اَكْثَرِهِمْ, i. e. <i>The saying,</i> “ I will assuredly fill Hell with genii and men together, ” [Kur xi. 120 and xxxii. 13,] (Bd,) or <i>the sentence</i> of punishment, (Jel,) <i>hath become necessitated</i> [<i>as suitable to the requirements of justice,</i> or <i>as being just</i> or <i>right,</i>] <i>to take effect upon the greater number of them;</i> syn. وَجَبَ, (Jel, TA,) and ثَبَتَ. (TA.) And this, namely, ثَبَتَ, is the meaning of the verb in the phrase, حَقَّ عَلَيْكَ القَضَا=ءُ [<i>The sentence was,</i> or, emphatically, <i>is, necessitated as suitable to the requirements of justice to take effect upon thee;</i> or <i>it was,</i> or <i>is, necessary, just,</i> or <i>right, that the sentence should take effect upon thee</i>]. (TA.) [In like manner,] one says, يَحِقُّ عَلَيْكَ اَنْ تَفْعَلَ <br>\
                  كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>It is necessary for thee</i> [<i>as suitable to the requirements of wisdom</i> or <i>justice</i> or <i>the like</i>], or <i>incumbent on thee,</i> or <i>just</i> or <i>proper</i> or <i>right for thee, that thou shouldst do such a thing.</i> (TA.) [Thus one says,] الحَقِيقَةُ مَا يَحِقُّ عَلَيْكَ <br>\
                  اَنْ تَحْمِيَهُ [<i>The</i> <br>\
                  حقيقة <br>\
                  <i>is that which it is necessary for thee</i> &amp;amp;c., or <i>that which it behooveth thee, that thou shouldst defend it,</i> or <i>protect it</i>]. (S, * K.) Accord. to Sh, the Arabs said, حَقَّ عَلَىَّ اَنْ <br>\
                  اَفْعَلَ ذٰلِكَ and حُقَّ: but accord. to Fr, when you say حَقَّ, you say عَلَيْكَ; and when you say حُقَّ, you say لَكَ. (TA.) [Accordingly] one says, حُقَّ لَكَ اَنْ تَفْعَلَ ذَا and حُقِقْتَ اَنْ تَفْعَلَهُ: both mean the same: (Ks, S, K:) [i. e., each has one, or the other, or both, of the meanings next following:] or the former means <i>It was,</i> or, emphatically, <i>is, rendered</i> <br>\
                  حّقّ [or <i>suitable to the requirements of wisdom</i> or <i>justice</i> &amp;amp;c.] <i>for thee,</i> or <i>necessary for thee,</i> or <i>incumbent on thee,</i> or <i>just</i> or <i>proper</i> or <i>right for thee,</i> [or <i>it behooved</i> or <i>behooves thee,</i>] <i>that thou shouldst do,</i> or <i>to do, this,</i> or <i>that:</i> and [the latter, or] حُقِقْتَ بِاَنْ <br>\
                  تَفْعَلَ, <i>Thou wast,</i> or, emphatically, <i>art, rendered</i> <br>\
                  حَقِيق [or <i>adapted, disposed, apt, meet, suited, suitable, fitted, fit, proper, competent,</i> or <i>worthy,</i>] <i>that thou shouldst do,</i> or <i>to do, this,</i> or <i>that</i>]: (A, TA:) and in like manner, حُقَّتْ signifies in the Kur lxxxiv. 2 and 5: (Bd, Jel: *) or حُقِقْتَ <br>\
                  بِاَنْ تَفْعَلَ may mean <i>thou wast,</i> or <i>art, known by the testimony of thy circumstances to be</i> <br>\
                  حَقِيق &amp;amp;c. (A, TA.) And مَا كَانَ يَحُقُّكَ اَنْ تَفْعَلَهُ <br>\
                   [virtually] means the same as مَا حُقَّ لَكَ [best rendered in this case <i>It did not behoove thee to do it</i>]. (TA.) One says also, حَقَّ اَنْ تَفْعَلَ [<i>It was,</i> or, emphatically, <i>is, necessary</i> &amp;amp;c. <i>that thou shouldst do</i> or <i>to do</i> such a thing]: but they did not say, حَقَقْتَ اَنْ تَفْعَلَ. (Fr, TA.) ―         -b2-  But حَقَّ عَلَىَّ اَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا means <i>Thy doing so distressed,</i> or <i>hath distressed,</i> or <i>afflicted, me;</i> or, emphatically, <i>distresses,</i> or <i>afflicts, me;</i> like عَزَّ عَلَىَّ. (S and K and TA in art. عز.) And in like manner, حَقَّ اَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ [or حَقَّ مَا اَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ] means عَزَّ مَا اَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ [<i>It is distressing to me that thou art going away</i>]. (TA in art. عز.) And لَحَقَّ مَا is used in the same manner as لَعَزَّ مَا, q. v. (A and TA in art. عز.) You say also, حَقَّتِ الحَاجَةُ <br>\
                  <i>Want befell,</i> or <i>betided,</i> or <i>happened, and was severe,</i> or <i>distressing:</i> (Msb, TA:) [which is said to be] from the phrase, حَقَّتِ <br>\

                  حقّ or حقّة, <i>bearing evidence</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (Msb:) [a phrase] to which a parallel is scarcely known, (Msb,) or to which there is no parallel (K) except اَسَدٌ بَيِّنُ الاَسَدِ [a lion bearing evidence of being like a lion in boldness]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  حِقٌّ [as inf. n. of حَقَّتْ] also signifies A she-camel&#39;s <i>overpassing the days</i> [<i>corresponding to those</i>] <i>in which she was covered</i> [<i>in the preceding year</i>]: (K:) or her <i>completing</i> [<i>the time of</i>] <i>her pregnancy;</i> as also ↓ <br>\

                     اَحَقُّ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                   [comparative and superlative of حَقِيقٌ]. You say, هُوَ اَحَقُّ بِكَذَا [<i>He is more,</i> and <i>most, adapted, disposed, apt, meet, suited, suitable, fitted, fit, proper,</i> or <i>competent, for such a thing;</i> or <i>more,</i> and <i>most, worthy,</i> or <i>deserving, of it:</i> and <i>he has a better,</i> and <i>the best, right to such a thing;</i> or <i>a more just,</i> and <i>the most just, title</i> or <i>claim</i> <br>\
                  <i>to it;</i> or <i>he is more,</i> and <i>most, entitled to it</i>]: this phrase is used in two senses: first, as denoting the possession of an exclusive right or title, i. e., without the participation of another; as when you say, زَيْدٌ اَحَقُّ بِمَالِهِ <br>\
                  <i>Zeyd is entitled to his property exclusively of any other person:</i> secondly, as denoting the possession of a right or title in participation with another person, but in a superior degree; as in the saying, الاَيِّمُ اَحَقُّ بِنَفْسِهَا <br>\
                  مِنْ وَلِيِّهَا, (Msb,) i. e. <i>The woman that has not a husband and is not a virgin</i> [<i>is more entitled to dispose of herself than is her guardian</i>]; (Mgh in art. ايم;) meaning that they participate [in the right], but that her right is the stronger: (Msb:) a saying of Mohammad, in which the ايّم is opposed to the بِكْر, for it is added that the بكر is to be asked her permission: but one reading substitutes الثَّيِّبُ for الايّم. (Mgh ubi suprà.) In the saying, in the Kur [v. 106], لَشَهَادَتُنَا اَحَقُّ <br>\
                  مِنْ شَهَادَتِهِمَا, it may be formed from اِسْتَحَقَّ by rejection of the augmentative letters, so that the meaning is, [<i>Verily our testimony is</i>] <i>more deserving of being accepted</i> [<i>than the testimony of them two</i>]: or it may be from حَقَّ الشَّىْءُ signifying ثَبَتَ, and so mean <i>more true,</i> or <i>valid.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  Applied to a horse, <i>That does not sweat.</i> (S, K.) ―         -b2-  And, likewise thus applied, <i>That puts down his hind hoof in the place</i> [<i>that has just before been that</i>] <i>of his fore hoof.</i> (S, * K.)
