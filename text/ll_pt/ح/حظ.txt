                  , sec. pers. حَظِظْتَ, (S, K,) aor. يَحَظُّ, (S,) inf. n. حَظٌّ, (K,) <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, fortunate,</i> or <i>possessed of good fortune,</i> (S, K,) فِى الاَمْرِ <br>\
                  <i>in the affair;</i> (K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      احظّ: (K, TA:) or ↓ the latter signifies <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, rich, wealthy,</i> or <i>opulent;</i> or <i>in a state of,</i> or <i>possessed of, competence,</i> or <i>sufficiency; in no need; without wants;</i> or <i>with few wants.</i> (O, TS.) Lth says, I have not heard any verb from حَظٌّ: but it has a verb, transmitted from the Arabs, which Lth did not know, and had not heard: and AHeyth says, in writing to Ibn-Buzurj, هُمْ <br>\
                  يُحَظُّونَ بِهِمْ, and يُجَدُّونَ بهم, (Az, TA,) meaning <i>They become possessed of good fortune, and riches,</i> or <i>competence,</i> or <i>sufficiency.</i> (L in art. جد.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   see 1, in two places.       -A2-  اَحْظَيْتُهُ عَلَيْهِ [<i>I preferred him above him</i>] may be from the same root as the other words of this art.; the second ظ being changed into ى; [like as اَمْلَيْتُ is, accord. to some, formed from اَمْلَلْتُ;] or it may be from حُظْوَةٌ.

                  <i>Fortune;</i> or particularly <i>good fortune;</i> syn. جَدٌّ (S, Nh, Msb, K) and بَخْتٌ: (Nh:) and <i>a share, portion,</i> or <i>lot:</i> (S, Msb, K:) or particularly <i>a share, portion,</i> or <i>lot, of something good</i> or <i>excellent:</i> (Lth, K:) some of the people of Hims say حَنْزٌ; but when they form a pl., they return to the original, saying حُظُوظٌ: and the ن is regarded by them as a nasal sound, not as a radical letter: and in like manner they do in the case of every word having a doubled letter, such as رُزٌّ and اُتْرُجٌّ, saying رٌنْزٌ and اُتْرُنْجٌ: (Lth, L:) the pl. (of pauc., S) is اَحُظٌّ (S, K) and (of mult., S) حُظُوظٌ (AZ, S, Msb, K) and حُظُوظَةٌ (Ibn- &#39;Abbád, K) and حِظَاظٌ (IJ, K) and حُظٌّ (AZ, K) and ↓ <br>\
      اَحَاظٍ, (S, L, K, [in the CK, erroneously, اَحَاظٌ,]) irregularly, as though it were pl. of اَحْظٍ, (S, L,) or it is regularly formed from اَحْظٍ, which latter is [irregular, being] originally اَحْظُظٌ, [which is the original form of the pl. of pauc. mentioned above,] (IB,) and another pl. is ↓ <br>\
      حِظَا=ءٌ, (L, [and so in the TA as from the K, but in several copies of the K ↓ <br>\
      حِظَّا=ءٌ, which is of one of the forms of quasi-pl. ns.,]) also irregular, being formed [from حِظَاظٌ] by a change of the second ظ [into ى and then into ء]. (L.)       -A2-  See also حَظِيظٌ.    </entryFree> <br>\

      حَظٌّ (S, K) and ↓ <br>\
      حَظِّىٌّ, as a relative n., accord. to [most of] the copies of the K, or as a defective word, [i. e. ↓ <br>\
      حَظِىٌّ, with a single ظ, as we find it in the CK,] accord. to Az, who says that it is originally حَظٌّ, (TA,) and ↓ <br>\
      مَحْظُوظٌ, (AA, S, Msb, K,) <i>Fortunate;</i> or <i>possessed of good fortune;</i> (S, Msb, K;) <i>possessing a good share</i> (حَظٌّ) <i> of the means of subsistence:</i> (TA:) or the first, accord. to Fr, <i>possessing competence,</i> or <i>sufficiency;</i> or <i>rich,</i> or <i>wealthy,</i> or <i>opulent:</i> (TA:) the pl. [accord. to analogy of حَظِيظٌ] is اَحِظَّا=ءُ. (So in the L: [in the TA written اَحْظَا=ء, which I think a mistake, though it seems to be there implied that it is pl. of حَظٌّ, and if so, we must suppose it to be originally اَحْظَاظٌ, like as حِظَا=ءٌ, a pl. of the subst. حَظٌّ, if correct, is originally حِظَاظٌ.])    </entryFree> <br>\
