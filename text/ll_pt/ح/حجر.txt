      مَحْجَرٌ (S, K) and ↓ <br>\
      حَاجُورٌ (K) [and ↓ <br>\
      مَحْجُورٌ], <i>Forbidden, prohibited, unlawful, inviolable,</i> or <i>sacred.</i> (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K.) Each of the first three forms occurs in different readings of the Kur vi. 139. (S.) You say, هٰذَا حِجْرٌ عَلَيْكَ <br>\
                  <i>This is forbidden,</i> or <i>unlawful, to thee.</i> (A.) In the time of paganism, a man meeting another whom he feared, in a sacred month, used to say, ↓ <br>\
      حِجْرًا مَحْجُورًا, meaning <i>It is rigorously forbidden</i> to thee [to commit an act of hostility against me] in this month: and the latter, thereupon, would abstain from any aggression against him: and so, on the day of resurrection, the polytheists, when they see the punishment, will say to the angels, thinking that it will profit them: (Lth, S: *) but Az says that I&#39; Ab and his companions explain these words [occurring in the Kur xxv. 24] otherwise, i. e., as said by the angels, and meaning, the joyful annunciation is forbidden to be made to you: and accord. to El-Hasan, the former word will be said by the sinners, and the latter is said by God, meaning it will be forbidden to them to be granted refuge or protection as they used to be in their former life in the world: but Az adds, it is more proper to regard the two words as composing one saying: (TA:) and the latter word is a corroborative of the former, like مَايِتٌ in the expression مَوْتٌ مَايِتٌ. (Bd.) The same words in the Kur xxv. 55 signify <i>A strong mutual repugnance,</i> or <i>incongruity;</i> as though each said what one says who seeks refuge or protection from another: or, as some say, <i>a defined limit.</i> (Bd.) A man says to another, “ Dost thou so and so, O such a one?” and the latter replies حِجْرًا, or ↓ <br>\
      حُجْرًا, or ↓ <br>\
      حَجْرًا, meaning [I pray for] <i>preservation, and acquitment,</i> from this thing; a meaning reducible to that of prohibition, and of a thing that is prohibited. (Sb.) The Arabs say, on the occasion of a thing that they disapprove, لَهُ ↓ <br>\
      حُجْرًا, with damm, meaning, <i>May it be averted.</i> (S.) ―         -b2-  Homeyd Ibn-Thowr says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\

                  </quote> meaning, <i>And I purposed doing to her a forbidden action: and verily the like of her is one to whom that which is forbidden is done.</i> (S, K.) ↓ <br>\
      مَحْجَرٌ is also explained as signifying حُرْمَةٌ; [app. meaning <i>a thing from which one is bound to refrain, from a motive of respect</i> or <i>reverence;</i>] and to have this meaning in the verse above. (Az.) ―         -b3-  Also, the first of these words, <i>Any</i> <br>\
                  حَايِط [i. e. <i>garden,</i> or <i>walled garden of palm-trees,</i>] <i>which one prohibits</i> [<i>to the public</i>]. (S.) ―         -b4-  And الحِجْرُ <br>\
                  <i>That</i> [<i>space</i>] <i>which is comprised by</i> [<i>the curved wall called</i>] <i>the</i> <br>\
                  حَطِيم, (S, A, Mgh, K,) <i>which encompasses the Kaabeh on the north</i> [or <i>rather north-west</i>] <i>side;</i> (S, A, K;) <i>on the side of the spout:</i> (Mgh:) or <i>the</i> <br>\
                  حطيم [<i>itself</i>], <i>which encompasses the Kaabeh on the side of the spout.</i> (Msb.) [It is applied to both of these in the present day; but more commonly to the former.] ―         -b5-  Also, حِجْرٌ, The <i>anterior pudendum</i> of a man and of a woman; and so ↓ <br>\
      حَجْرٌ: (K, TA:) the latter the more chaste. (TA.) ―         -b6-  <i>A mare;</i> the <i>female of the horse:</i> (S, A, Msb, K:) and <i>a mare kept for breeding;</i> (A;) as though her womb were forbidden to all but generous horses: (T:) but in the latter sense the sing. is scarcely ever used; though its pl., the first of the following forms, (as well as the second, A,) is used to signify mares kept for breeding: (K:) ↓ <br>\
      حِجْرَةٌ, as a sing., is said by F and others to be a barbarism: it occurs in a trad.; but perhaps the ة is there added to assimilate it to بَغْلَةٌ, with which it is there coupled: (MF:) the pl. [of pauc.] is اَحْجَارٌ (Msb, K) and [of mult.] حُجُورٌ (A, Msb, K) and حُجُورَةٌ. (K.) A poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  <i>When the stallion,</i> seeing the army and the gleaming swords, <i>is mute in the midst of the mares kept for breeding,</i> and does not look towards them, <i>and the dogs bark</i> at their masters, because of the change of their appearances, <i>and children behave undutifully</i> to their mothers whom fear diverts from attending to them. (A.) ―         -b7-  <i>Relationship</i> [<i>that prohibits marriage</i>]; <i>nearness with respect to kindred.</i> (Msb, K.) ―         -b8-  <i>Understanding, intelligence, intellect, mind,</i> or <i>reason:</i> (S, A, Msb, K:) so in the Kur lxxxix. 4: (S, Bd:) thus called because it forbids that which it does not behoove one to do. (Bd.) One says, فِى ذٰلِكَ عِبْرَةٌ لِذِي حِجْرٍ <br>\
                  <i>In that is an admonition to him who possesses understanding,</i> &amp;amp;c. (A.)       -A2-  See also حَجُرٌ, in three places.    </entryFree> <br>\

      اُحْجُرٌّ signifies the same: (Fr, K:) pl.

El-Ahnaf Ibn-Keys said to &#39;Alee, when Mo&#39;á- wiyeh named &#39;Amr Ibn-El-&#39;Ás as one of the two umpires, قَدْ رُمِيتَ بِحَجَرِ الاَرْضِ فَاْجْعَلْ مَعَهُ اْبْنَ <br>\
