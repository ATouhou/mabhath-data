                  , aor. يَحِيكُ, inf. n. حَيْكٌ and حَيَكٌ and حِيَاكَةٌ, accord. to Lth, signifies <i>He wove</i> a piece of cloth: [and it is said in the K, in art. حوك, that the root of the verb in this sense is with و and with ى:] but Az says that this is a mistake; and that the verb is only حاك having for its aor. يَحُوكُ, inf. n. حَوْكٌ. (TA. [See, however, what follows.])       -A2-  حاك, (S, K,) or حاك فِى مِشْيَتِهِ, (TA,) aor. يَحِيكُ, inf. n. حَيَكَانٌ (S, K) and حَيْكٌ (K) and حَيَكَى (Mbr, TA) [and حِيَاكَةٌ, which see in what follows], <i>He</i> (a man, TA) <i>walked with an elegant and a proud and selfconceited gait, with an affected inclining of the body from side to side,</i> or <i>with a twisting of the back:</i> or <i>he moved about his shoulder-joints and his body in walking,</i> (K, TA,) <i>having much flesh;</i> which manner of walking in women is commended, but in men it is discommended; for the woman walks thus by reason of the largeness of her thighs; but the man, when his thighs, or legs, are wide apart: or, as some say, it signifies <i>he trod the ground vehemently:</i> (TA:) or <i>he moved about his shoulder-joints, and parted his legs widely, in walking,</i> [<i>as short persons do:</i> for] حَيَكَانٌ signifies the <i>manner of walking of him who is short:</i> (S:) or <i>a walking in which a man moves about his posteriors:</i> all which meanings are borrowed from the action of the حَايِك [or weaver, who straddles when at work]: حِيَاكَةٌ, likewise, signifies <i>a walking with an elegant and a proud and self-conceited gait, with an affected inclining of the body from side to side,</i> or <i>with a twisting of the back, and in a lagging manner.</i> (TA.) And you say also, ↓ <br>\

      احاك. (K, TA.) حاك فِيهِ (S) and فيه ↓ <br>\
      احاك (S, K) and ↓ <br>\
      اَحاكهُ, (K,) said of a sword, signify the same: (S, K:) one says, فِيهِ السَّيْفَ ↓ <br>\
      ضَرَبَهُ فَمَا اَحَاكَ, i. e. [<i>He struck him, but the sword</i>] <i>made no impression,</i> or <i>had no effect, upon him.</i> (S, TA.) And حَاكَت الشَّفْرَةُ <br>\
                  <i>The</i> [<i>knife called</i>] شفرة <br>\
                  <i>cut;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      احاكت. (K.) And ما تَحِيكُ المُدْيَةُ اللَّحْمَ [<i>The butcher&#39;s knife does not cut the flesh-meat</i>], and ما تحيك فِيهِ: both signify alike. (El-Ámidee, TA.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] حاك القَوْلُ فِى القَلْبِ, inf. n. حَيْكٌ, (assumed tropical:)  <i>The saying took effect upon the heart;</i> (Sh, S, K, TA;) and <i>became fixed therein.</i> (Sh, TA.) And مَا يَحِيكُ <br>\
                  فِيهِ المَلَامُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Blame does not make any impression upon him.</i> (S.) And مَا يَحِيكُ كَلَامُكَ فِى فلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Thy speech does not make any impression upon such a one.</i> (TA.) And it is said [in a trad., as some read it], الاـِثْمُ مَا حَاكَ فِى صَدْرِكَ وَكَرِهْتَ <br>\
                  اَنْ يَطَّلِعَ عَلَيْهِ النَّاسُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Sin is that which makes an impression upon thy mind, and becomes fixed</i> [<i>therein, and with which thou dislikest that men should become acquainted</i>]. (Az, TA. [See also حَكَّ; and see حَزَّ.])    </entryFree> <br>\
