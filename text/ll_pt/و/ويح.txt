                   a word denoting compassion, or pity: (AZ, As, S, K:) وَيْلٌ denotes [an imprecation of] punishment; (S;) or [of] removal from good, or from prosperity: (AZ, As:) or [of] destruction: (AZ:) and وَيْسٌ denotes the same as ويح; (AZ;) or less than ويح: (As:) or ويح and ويس denote compassion, or pity, and admiration of one&#39;s beauty; as when you say of a child, وَيْحَهُ مَا اَمْلَحَهُ, and وَيْسَهُ ما املحه, [<i>Mercy on him!</i> or the like: <i>how beautiful is he!</i>] (Kh) or, accord. to most of the lexicologists, ويل is a word said to, or of, any one who falls into destruction or trial, or misfortune, and on whom one does not wish God&#39;s mercy: and ويح is said to, or of, any one who falls into trial or misfortune, and for whom one wishes God&#39;s mercy, and his escape therefrom: the former word being so used in the Kur-án, and the latter by the Prophet: (T:) or ويل is said to, or of, him who falls into destruction: and ويح is a word by which one chides him who is at the point of falling into destruction: (Sb:) or ويح and ويل are syn., (Yz, En-Nadr, S, Ibn-Et-Faraj,) and ويس signifies the same: (Ibn-El-Faraj:) or ويح is a little softer, or more gentle, than ويل: (En-Nadr:) [if so, وَيْحَهُ signifies <i>woe to him:</i> in the same, or in a milder, manner than وَيْلَهُ:] or the original of  <br>\
                  ويح is وَيْ; sometimes ح being added to this latter word, and sometimes ل and sometimes ب, and sometimes س; (K;) so that it becomes ويح and ويل and ويب and ويس. (TA.) [See ويل and ويب and ويس and وي.] You say وَيْحٌ <br>\
                  لِزَيْدٍ [<i>Mercy on Zeyd!</i> or <i>woe to Zeyd!</i>]; putting ويح in the nom. case as an inchoative; (S, K;) and in like manner, وَيْلٌ لِزَيْدٍ: (S:) and also وَيْحًا لِزَيْدٍ; putting ويح in the acc. case because of a verb understood; (S, K;) as though you said اَلْزَمَهُ اْللّٰهُ وَيْحًا [<i>May God make mercy,</i> or <i>woe, to attend him constantly!</i>]; and in like manner, وَيْلًا لِزَيْدٍ: (S:) or [it is put in the acc. case as an absolute complement of a verb understood, i. e., as an inf. n., and] the meaning is اَتَرَحَّمُهُ تَرَحُّمًا. [<i>I say, May God have mercy on him! emphatically</i>]: (Z, in the Fáïk:) you also say وَيْحَكَ, and وَيْحَ زَيْدٍ; (S, K;) making ويح a prefixed n.; (S;) and putting it in the acc. case again because of a verb understood; (S, K;) and in like manner, وَيْلَكَ, and وَيْلَ زَيْدٍ: (S:) and also وَيْحَمَا زَيْدٍ in the same sense.
