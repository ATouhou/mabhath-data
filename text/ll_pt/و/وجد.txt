                  , aor. يَجِدُ and يَجُدُ, (S, L, Msb, K,) the latter of the dial. of the tribe of &#39;Ámir (S, L, Msb) Ibn-Saasa&#39;ah, (MF,) and without a parallel (S, L, Msb, K) in verbs of this class, (S, L, Msb,) the و in it being dropped because it falls out in the original form of the aor., (Msb,) both of which forms are said by several authors to apply to the verb in all its significations, though F seems to restrict the latter to two significations, (TA,) inf. n. وُجُودٌ (S, L, Msb, K) and وِجْدَان (L, Msb, K,) and اـِجْدَانٌ, (IAar, L, K,) in which the و is changed into ء, (L,) and وَجْدٌ and وُجْدٌ and جِدَةٌ; (L, K;) and وَجِدَهُ, aor. يَجِدُ; (K;) but this form of the verb is not found in the lexicons, [the K only accepted,] (MF,) in the sense here assigned to it; (TA;) <i>He found it; lighted on it; attained it; obtained it by searching</i> or <i>seeking; discovered it; perceived it; saw it; experienced it,</i> or <i>became sensible of it;</i> (F, in the K and in the Basáïr, on the authority of Abu-l-Kásim El-Isbahánee;) namely, a thing sought, sought for or after, or desired; (S, L, K;) and simply a thing. (L.) وُجُود is of several kinds. It is The <i>finding, &amp;amp;c., by means of any one of the five senses:</i> as when one says وَجَدْتُ زَيْدًا [<i>I found, &amp;amp;c., Zeyd</i>]: and وَجَدَتُ طَعْمَهُ, and رَايِحَتَهُ, and صَوْتَهُ, and خُشُونَتَهُ, [<i>I found,</i> or <i>perceived, &amp;amp;c., its taste,</i> and <i>its odour,</i> and <i>its sound,</i> and <i>its roughness</i>]. Also, The <i>finding, &amp;amp;c., by means of the faculty of appetite,</i> [<i>or rather of sensation,</i> which is the cause of appetite:] as when one says وَجَدْتُ <br>\
                  الشِّبَعَ [<i>I found, experienced,</i> or <i>became sensible of, satiety</i>]. Also, The <i>finding, &amp;amp;c., by the intellect,</i> or <i>by means of the intellect:</i> of which kind is one&#39;s knowing God: and here it should be observed, that وجود attributed to God is simple knowledge: (Abu-l-Kásim El-Isbahánee, cited in the Basáïr:) وَجَدَ اْللّٰهُ, wherever it occurs, means <i>God knew.</i> (Er-Rághib, Z, &amp;amp;c.) i. e., in the Kur-án. (TA.) ―         -b2-  وَجَدَ [<i>He found, in the sense of</i>] <i>he knew</i> [<i>by experience</i>]. (A, TA, &amp;amp;c.) [In this sense, it is a verb of the kind called اَفْعَالُ القُلُوبِ; having two objective complements; the first of which is called its noun, and the second its predicate.] Ex. وَجَدْتُ <br>\
                  زَيْدًا ذَا الحِفَاظِ <br>\
                  <i>I</i> [<i>found,</i> or] <i>knew Zeyd to possess the quality of defending those things which should be sacred,</i> or <i>inviolable.</i> (A.) Used in this sense, as doubly trans., its inf. n. is وَجْدَانٌ (Akh) and وُجُودٌ. (Seer.) It is also used as singly trans., as syn. with عَلِمَ. (TA.) ―         -b3-  When وَجَدَ signifies <i>he found,</i> or <i>lighted on,</i> a thing after it had gone away, its inf. n. is وِجْدَانٌ. (IKtt.) ―         -b4-  وَجَدَ الضَّالَّةَ, (S, A, Msb,) aor. يَجِد (Msb) and يَجُدُ, (MF,) inf. n. وَجْدَانٌ (S, Msb) and لَمْ اَجِدْ مِنْ ذٰلِكَ بُدًّا (Msb) [<i>He found the stray beast</i>]. ―         -b5-  لَمْ اَجِدْ مِنْ ذٰلِكَ بُدًّا, for which one also says لَمْ اجدِ, <i>I found no means of avoiding,</i> or <i>escaping, that.</i> (Kz, TA.) ―         -b6-  وَجَدَ, (L,) and وَجَدَ فِى المَالِ, (Fs, T, S, L, Msb,) and وَجَدَ المَالَ وَغَيَرَهُ, (Lh, M, K,) aor. يَجِدُ, (Lh, M, L, K,) inf. n. وُجْد and وِجد and وَجْدٌ- and جِدَهٌ (Lh, T, S, M, K) and وِجْدَانٌ (T, L) an[id وُجُودٌ, (Yz,) <i>He became possessed of wealth,</i> or <i>property:</i> (T:) or <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, rich; possessed of competence,</i> or <i>sufficiency; in no need; without wants,</i> or <i>with few wants;</i> (S, M, L, K;) <i>so as not to be poor afterwards:</i> (L:) and <i>he gained, acquired,</i> or <i>earned wealth.</i> (Exps. of the Fs.) Hence the saying of the Arabs, وِجْدَانُ الرَّقِينِ يُغَطِّى اَفَنَ الاَفِينِ [<i>The possession of money hides the weakness of judgment of the weak in judgment</i>]. (T, L.)       -A2-  وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ, (S, L, K, &amp;amp;c.) aor. يَجِدُ (Fs, M, L, K) and يَجُدُ; (M, L, K;) and وَجِدَ, as heard by Fr from certain of the Arabs; (Kzz;) inf. n. مَوْجِدَةٌ, (Fs, S, A, L, Msb, K,) by some pronounced مَوْجَدَةٌ, (Fr,) and وَجْدٌ and جِدَةٌ (L, K) and وِجْدَانٌ (Lh, S, M, L) and وُجُودٌ (Fr, Kzz) <i>He was angry with him:</i> (Fs, S, A, L, Msb, K) or <i>he was angry with him with the anger that proceeds from a friend.</i> (TA, voce عَتْبٌ.)       -A3-  وَجَدَ بِهِ, (aor. يَجِدُ, L,) inf. n. وَجْدٌ, <i>He loved him.</i> (L, K.) وَجَدَ بِهَا, (A, L,) and ↓ <br>\
      توّجد, (A,) <i>He loved her;</i> (A, L;) <i>he loved her passionately</i> or <i>fondly.</i> (L.) لَهُ بِهَا وَجْدٌ <br>\
                  <i>He has a love</i> [or <i>passionate</i> or <i>fond love</i>] <i>for her.</i> (A.)       -A4-  وَجَدَ, [aor. يَجِدُ,] (&#39;Eyn, Fs, S, L, Msb, &amp;amp;c.,) and وَجِدَ, [aor. يَوْجَدُ,] (El-Hejeree, M, K,) the latter the only form mentioned in the K, but the former is the only form generally known, (MF, TA,) and وَجُدَ, (Lh, M, L,) inf. n. وَجْدٌ, (S, L, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.,) <i>He grieved; mourned; sorrowed.</i> (S, L, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.) You say, وَجَدْتُ <br>\
                  بِهِ, (Msb,) and لَهُ ↓ <br>\
      توجّدت, (S, L,) <i>I grieved, mourned,</i> or <i>sorrowed, for such a one.</i> (S, L, Msb.) Ibn-Hishám El-Lakhmee says, that in this sense وجد is not transitive: (MF:) [i. e., without a prep.].       -A5-  وُجِدَ, (inf. n. وُجُودٌ, A, Msb,) <i>It existed; it became existent</i> (A, Msb) from a state of nonexistence.
