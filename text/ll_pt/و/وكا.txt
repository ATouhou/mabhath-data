                  <i>He sat in a firm,</i> or <i>settled, manner:</i> and <i>he sat leaning upon one of his sides:</i> (Msb, in art. تكا:) the vulgar know it only in the latter sense: but it signifies <i>he leaned, rested,</i> or <i>stayed, his back,</i> or <i>his side, against,</i> or <i>upon, a thing:</i> and <i>he leaned, rested,</i> or <i>stayed, himself in any manner, upon a thing.</i> (IAth, in Msb, art. وكا.) ―         -b2-  اِتَّكَاَ عَلَى شَىْءٍ, (S,) and ↓ <br>\

                  <i>He made for him</i> [i. e., app., for himself,] <i>a thing upon which to lean,</i> or <i>recline:</i> (CK, and a MS. copy of the K:) or <i>he made him to be a thing upon which to lean,</i> or <i>recline.</i> (TA.) [The latter seems to be wrong, unless the verb be read اَتْكَاَ.] ―         -b5-  اِتَّكَاْنَا عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  <i>We ate a repast with,</i> or <i>at the abode of, such a one.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  اِتَّكَاَتْ (MF) and ↓ <br>\
      تَوَكَّاَتْ (K) <i>She</i> (a camel) <i>was taken with the pains of labour, and cried out.</i> (K.) Accord. to Lth, تَوَكُّوُ النَّاقَةِ signifies تصلّفها عند مخاضها: (TA:) [but it is evident that the right reading is تصلّقها; and the sense agreeable with the above explanation].    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>I</i> (said Mohammad) <i>eat not sitting in a firm,</i> or <i>settled, posture, cross-legged,</i> or <i>in such other similar manner as is adapted for much eating:</i> for he used to eat sitting upon his hams, with his shanks erect, so as to be ready to rise.
