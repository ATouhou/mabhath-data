                  , aor. يَرِثُ, (S, K,) an instance of deviation from a constant rule, there being only the following verbs of the measure فَعِلَ which have the aorists of the measure يَفْعِلُ only, namely, وَثِقَ, وَرِثَ, وَرِعَ, وَرِمَ, وَرِىَ, وَفِقَ, وَلِىَ, and وَمِقَ, (Ibn-Málik and others,) and وَصِبَ: (TA, art. وَصب:) the و falls out in يَرِثُ [&amp;amp;c.] because it occurs between ى and kesreh; and in those persons of the aor. which begin with ا and ت and ن because these letters are changed from ى, which is the original: (S:) inf. n. وِرْثٌ and اـِرْثٌ, (S, K,) in which the و is changed into ا, (S,) and رِثَةٌ, (S, K,) in which the ة is a substitute for the [elided] و, (S,) and وِرَاثَةٌ (S, K,) [the most common form] and اـِرَاثَةٌ, (TA,) and accord. to some مِيرَاثٌ, but this is an error, for مِفْعَالٌ is not one of the measure of inf. ns., (ISd,) [but it is used by some of the professors of practical law as an inf. n.,] and تُراثٌ: (Msb [but see وِرْثٌ below]:) <i>He inherited.</i> (S, K, &amp;amp;c.) You say وَرِثَ اَبَاهُ <br>\
                  <i>He inherited</i> [<i>the property of</i>] <i>his father:</i> (S, K:) but the original phrase is وَرِثَ مَالَ اَبِيهِ <br>\
                  <i>He inherited the property of his father.</i> (Msb.) Also وَرِثَ مِنْ اَبِيهِ (and عَنْهُ, A,) <i>He inherited of his father:</i> (K:) or <i>he inherited part of the property of his father.</i> (Msb.) And وَرِثَ الشَّىْءَ مِنْ اَبِيهِ <br>\
                  <i>He inherited the thing of,</i> or <i>from, his father.</i> (S.) When you say وَرِثَ زَيْدٌ اَبَاهُ مَالًا [<i>Zeyd inherited of his father property</i>], the word مالا is a second objective complement, if the verb be doubly trans.; or it is a substitute of implication (بَدَلُ اْشْتِمَالٍ) for زيد. (MF.) You say وَرِثْتُهُ <br>\
                  مَالَهُ, and مَجْدَهُ, <i>I inherited his property,</i> and, (tropical:)  <i>his glory:</i> and وَرِثْتُهُ عَنْهُ <br>\
                  <i>I inherited it from him.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

Or, accord. to another relation, which substitutes وَاْجْعَلْهُمَا for واجعله, <i>make them both to continue with me, sound, until I die.</i> Or, as some say, what is meant is the continuance and strength of those two faculties in old age, so that they may survive all the other powers: so says ISh. Some say, that by سَمْع is meant the remembering of what is heard, and the acting according thereto; and by بَصَر, the being admonished by what is seen, and the light of the heart, whereby one escapes from perplexity and darkness to the right course.
