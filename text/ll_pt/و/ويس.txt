                   a word used to. denote compassion, or pity, and admiration of one&#39;s beauty; (M, K;) the object being a child; (K;) as when one says of a child, وَيْسَهُ مَا اَمْلَحَهُ [<i>Merry on him!</i> or the like: <i>how beautiful is he!</i>]: (TA:) or وَيْسٌ and وَيْحٌ are used in the place of وَيْلٌ; (TA;) and وَيْسٌ لَهُ signifies وَيْلٌ لَهُ [<i>Woe to him!</i>]: (M, TA:) or, as some say, وَيْسٌ is a word denoting contempt; and has no verb; analogy forbidding that it should have one: (IJ, M:) Aboo-Turáb says, I heard Abu-sSemeyda&#39; say, وَيْسٌ and وَيْحٌ and وَيْلٌ have one meaning: (TA:) or وَيْسَكَ is not said except to children; and وَيْلَكَ is an expression in which is roughness and reproach; and ويح is a gentle and good expression. (AHát, TA.) See ويْحٌ and وَيْلٌ and وَيْبٌ. ―         -b2-  It also signifies <i>Poverty.</i> (ISk, M.) And one may say, if it be right to say so to one, وَيْسٌ لَهُ as meaning <i>Poverty be to him.</i> (ISk.) ―         -b3-  Also, <i>What a man desires.</i> (M, K.) So in the phrase لَقِىَ وَيْسًا <br>\
                  <i>He found,</i> or <i>met with,</i> or <i>experienced, what he desired;</i> (M, K;) accord. to an explanation given by IAar; so that it means <i>much:</i> but in one place he says that this phrase signifies <i>he found,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>what he did not desire.</i> (M.)   </entryFree> <br>\
