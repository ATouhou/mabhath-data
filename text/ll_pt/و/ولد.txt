The latter are those born, not merely since the first corruption of the Arabic language, which happened in, or before, the age of Mohammad, (see Mz, 44th نوع,) but since the extensive corruption which happened after the Arabs had spread themselves, by their conquests, among foreigners, in consequence of which their language became simplified.
