                  , aor. يَثِبُ, inf. n. وَثْبٌ and وُثُوبٌ (the latter agreeable with analogy, TA,) and وَثَبَانٌ and وَثِيبٌ (S, K) and وِثاَبٌ (K; but this is generally affirmed to be an inf. n. of وَاثَبَ, TA;) and ثِبَةٌ, (Ibn-Málik and others) <i>He leaped; jumped; sprang; bounded:</i> (S, K:) or <i>he leaped down,</i> or <i>downwards.</i> (Mgh, Msb, art. طفر.) ―         -b2-  وَثَبَ المَوْضِعَ [<i>He leaped,</i> or <i>jumped, upon,</i> or <i>over the place</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b3-  وَثَبَ اـِلَى الشَّرَفِ وَثْبَةً (tropical:)  [<i>He made a single leap to eminence,</i> or <i>nobility</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b4-  وَثَبَ اـِلَيْهِ [app., <i>He leaped,</i> or <i>sprang up,</i> or <i>he hastened, to him</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b5-  الوُثُوبُ, except in the dial. of Himyer, signifies <i>The act of rising,</i> or <i>standing up.</i> (TA.) ―         -b6-  It is also much used by the vulgar as signifying <i>The act of hastening to a thing;</i> as observed by MF, who is wrong in saying that there is nothing in the lexicons that favours its being so used. (TA.)       -A2-  وَثَبَ, [aor. يَثِبُ,] inf. n. وَثْبٌ, in the dial. of Himyer signifies <i>He sat; sat down.</i> (K, TA, from a trad.) ثِبْ in that dial. signifies <i>Sit; sit down.</i> (S.) It is related that Zeyd Ibn-Abd-Allah Ibn-Dárim came as an envoy to one of the kings of Himyer, and found him at a hunting-place belonging to him, on a high mountain, and he saluted him, and mentioned to him his lineage, or relationship; whereupon the king said to him ثِبْ, meaning اـِجْلِسْ, <i>Sit;</i> but the man thought that he commanded him to leap from the mountain; and he said, “ Thou shalt find me, O king, very obedient: ” then he leaped from the mountain, and perished. So the king said, “ What ailed him? ” And they explained to him his case, and his mistake respecting the word: upon which he said لَيْسَتْ عِنْدَنَا عَرَبِيَّتْ مَنْ <br>\
                  دَخَلَ ظَفَارِ حَمَّرَ i. e., [“ Arabic is not current with us: ” (for, probably, in the time of this king, the term عَرَبِيَّة was only applied to the general language of Arabia:) “ whoso entereth Dhafári,] let him learn [or, rather, speak, as MF says,] the Himyeree language. ” (Mz., 16th نوع.) [The principal facts of this anecdote are also mentioned in the S, on the authority of As.] By the king&#39;s saying عَرَبِيَّتْ was meant العَرَبِيَّةُ: the ة is pronounced ت in the case of a pause (which is the case here) in their dialect. (S.) Or, accord. to another relation of the above anecdote, the king said لَيْسَ عِنْدَنَا عَرَبِيَّتْ كَعَرَبِيَّتْكُمْ [“ Arabic like  your Arabic is not current with us: ”] and this, says ISd, is the right reading in my opinion: for the king did not mean to exclude himself from the Arabs.
