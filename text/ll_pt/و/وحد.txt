The Koofees hold it to be in the acc. case as an adv. n. of place: the Basrees, as an inf. n., in every instance; as though thou saidst اَوْحَدْتُهُ <br>\
                  بِرُوْيَتِى اـِبحَادًا, meaning “ I saw none save him, ” and then substituted وحده: or, as Abu-l-&#39;Abbás says, it may mean the man&#39;s being himself alone; as though thou saidst رَاَيْتُ رَجُلًا مُنْفَرِدًا <br>\
                  اِنْفِرَادًا, and then substituted وحده. (S.) Or it is in the acc. case as a denotative of state accord. to the Basrees [and the grammarians in general]; not as an inf. n., J being in error in what he says on this matter: (IB, K:) the Basrees hold it to be a noun occupying the place of an inf. n. in the acc. case as a denotative of state; like جَا=ءَ زَيْدٌ رَكْضًا, meaning رَاكِضًا: (IB:) excepting some of them, as Yoo, who holds it to be in the acc. case as an adv. n. of place, for عَلَى وَحْدِهِ, (IB, K,) like عِنْدَهُ: (TA:) and there is a third opinion, that of Hishám; that it is in the acc. case as an inf. n. (L.) Or, (accord. to IAar, L,) it is a noun used as a noun absolutely: (L, K:) so in the dial. of the Benoo-Temeem: (Msb:) you say جَلَسَ وَحْدَهُ, and عَلَى وَحْدِهِ, and جَلَسَا عَلَى وَحْدِ هِمَا, and وَحْدَيْهِمَا, and جَلَسُوا عَلَى وَحْدِهِمْ, [<i>He sat alone,</i> and <i>they two sat alone,</i> and <i>they sat alone</i>]. (L, K.) When not preceded by a prefixed n. [or a prep.], it is always in the acc. case: (Lth, L:) you say, لَا اـِلَاَه اـِلَّا اْللّٰهُ وَحْدَهُ [<i>There is no deity but God alone</i>]: and مَرَرْتُ <br>\
                  بِزَيْدٍ وَحْدَهُ [<i>I passed by Zeyd alone</i>]: (L:) [excepting in a few cases, such as the phrases] قُلْنَا هٰذَا الاَمْرَ وَحْدَيْنَا [<i>We two alone said this thing</i>], and قَالَتَاهُ وَحْدَيْهُمَا [<i>They two</i> women <i>alone said it</i>]; mentioned by AZ. (L.) You say also, هٰذَا عَلَى وَحْدِهِ, and ↓ <br>\
      عَلَى حِدَتِهِ, <i>This is by itself;</i> (L, K;) and هُمَا عَلَى حِدَتِهِمَا <br>\
                  <i>They two are by themselves:</i> and هُمْ عَلَى حِدَتِهِمْ <br>\
                  <i>They are by themselves:</i> (L:) and اَعْطِ كُلَّ وَاحِدٍ <br>\
                  مَنْهُمْ عَلَى حِدَتِهِ <br>\
                  <i>Give thou to every one of them by himself;</i> syn. على حِيَالِهِ. (S.) The ة in حِدَةٌ is a substitute for the و (S, L) which is cut off from the beginning. (L.) ―         -b3-  وَحْدٌ, (K,) or ↓ <br>\
      وَحَدٌ, (L,) A wild animal <i>alone, by itself,</i> or <i>apart from others.</i> (L, K.) ―         -b4-  وَحَدٌ, (K,) or ↓ <br>\
      وَحَدٌ, (L,) A man <i>whose lineage and origin are unknown.</i> (Lth, L, K.) ―         -b5-  وَحْد is used as the complement of a prefixed n. only in the following phrases: (A&#39;Obeyd, S, L:) هُوَ نَسِيجُ وَحْدِهِ, which is an expression of praise; (S, L, K;) meaning, (tropical:)  <i>He is one unequalled; one who has no second:</i> (L:) or <i>he is a man of right judgment:</i> you say also هُمَا نَسِيجَا وَحْدِهِمَا, and هُمْ نُسَجَا=ءُ وَحْدِهِمْ, and هِىَ نَسِيجَةُ وَحْدِهَا, and هُنَّ نَسَايِجُ وَحْدِهِنَّ: (Lth, L:) [see art. نسج:] it is as though you said نَسِيجُ اـِفْرَادٍ: you put وحده in the place of an inf. n. in the gen. case: (S:) and رَجُلُ وَحْدِهِ, (IAar, L,) and رُجَيْلُ وَحْدِهِ, (S, L,) [<i>A man unequalled; who has no second,</i> and <i>a little man</i> (probably meaning the contr.) &amp;amp;c.]: and قَرِيعُ وَحْدِهِ <br>\
                  <i>A man with whom no one contends in excellence:</i> (Lth, L:) and عُيَيْرُ وَحْدِهِ, and جُحَيْشُ وَحْدِهِ, which are expressions of dispraise; (S, L, K;) meaning, (tropical:)  <i>One who does not consult, nor mix with, any one, and who is contemptible and weak:</i> (Sh, L:) وَحْد being used in the manner of an inf. n., not being an epithet nor an enunciative so as to be in concordance with the preceding noun, would be more properly in the acc. case; but the Arabs use it in these instances as the complement of a prefixed n.: (Lth, L:) these expressions are indeterminate: for the Arabs say, رُبَّ نَسِيجِ وَحْدِهِ <br>\

[in many cases, which will be shown below,] with اَحَدٌ: (K:) [and <i>one alone:</i> a <i>single</i> person or thing:] fem. وَاحِدَةٌ: (L, Msb:) it sometimes receives the dual form; (L, K;) as in the expression اـِلْتَقَيْنَا وَاحِدَيْنِ [<i>We met, we being each of us one alone</i>]; cited from a poet by IAar: or the dual form pertains to it in another sense, explained below, namely “ alone: ” (L:) pl. وَاحِدُونَ (S, L, K) and وُحْدَانٌ and اُحْدَانٌ; (S, L;) in the last of which, ا is substituted for و because of the dammeh: (L:) one says, اَنْتُمْ حَىٌّ وَاحِدٌ, and حَىٌّ وَاحِدُونَ, (Ye are one tribe, L) like as one says شِرْذِمَةٌ قَلِيلُونَ: (Fr, S, L:) ا=حَادٌ may also be a pl. of وَاحِدٌ [and therefore originally اَوْحَادٌ,] like as اَشْهَادٌ is pl. of شَاهِدٌ. (Th, Msb.) Its proper signification is A thing <i>having no subdivision:</i> and it is secondarily applied to any existing thing; so that there is no number to which it may not be applied as an epithet; wherefore one says, عَشَرَةٌ وَاحِدَةٌ [<i>One ten</i>], and مِايَةٌ وَاحِدَةٌ [<i>One hundred</i>]. (Er-Rághib.) It is interchangeable for اَحَدٌ when used as an epithet applied to God; and in certain nouns of number. [See art. احد.] In most cases differing from these two, there is a difference in usage. The latter is used in affirmative phrases as a prefixed noun only, governing the noun which follows it in the gen. case; and is used absolutely in negative phrases: whereas the former is used in affirmative phrases as a prefixed n. and otherwise.
