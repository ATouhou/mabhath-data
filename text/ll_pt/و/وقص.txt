You say also, وَقَصَتْ بِهِ رَاحِلَتُهُ [<i>His riding-camel,</i> or <i>she-camel, broke its neck</i>]: (S, K:) like as you say, خُذِ <br>\
                  الخِطَامَ and خُذْ بِالخِطَام: (S:) and وَقَصَتِ <br>\

                  <i>The she-camel threw her rider and broke his neck.</i> (Msb.) And وُقِصَ <br>\
                  <i>He had his neck broken;</i> (S, K;) said of a man; (S:) [and also] said of a camel, signifying, <i>he became diseased in his back, and without motion:</i> and in like manner said of the neck, and of the back. (Khálid Ibn-Jembeh.) And وَقَصْتُ رَاْسَهُ <br>\
                  <i>I pressed,</i> or <i>squeezed, his head;</i> sometimes meaning, <i>so as to break the neck.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] وَقَصَ الدَّيْنُ عُنُقَهُ (tropical:)  <i>Debt</i> [<i>oppressed him as though it</i>] <i>broke his neck.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  [Hence also,] الفَرَسُ <br>\

                  <i>The neck broke:</i> thus the verb is intrans. as well as trans.: (K:) or, accord. to Ks, one does not say this: (S:) i. e., one only says of the neck وُقِصَت, using the pass. form.

                  <i>and that called</i> <br>\
                  الخَبَب; (K;) <i>falling short of the latter, but exceeding the former, and removing his legs as in the pace called</i> <br>\
                  الخبب, <i>excepting that they were nearer to the ground, and throwing himself</i> [<i>forward</i>]: (AO:) or <i>he trod vehemently in going,</i> (K, TA,) <i>with short steps,</i> (TA,) <i>as though breaking what was beneath him:</i> (K, TA:) or <i>he</i> (a horse) <i>bounded</i> (As, S, A) <i>in his running,</i> (As,) <i>making short steps,</i> (As, S, A,) <i>as though breaking his steps.</i> (A.) You say, مَرَّ فُلَانٌ يَتَوَقَّصُ بِهِ فَرَسُهُ <br>\
                  <i>Such a one passed along, his horse bounding, and making short steps, with him.</i> (S.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                   (tropical:)  <i>Fragments,</i> or <i>broken pieces, of sticks, which are thrown upon,</i> (S,) or <i>into,</i> (K,) <i>a fire:</i> (S, K:) or <i>small pieces of fire-wood with which a fire is made to burn more vehemently;</i> (A, TA;) as also وَقَشٌ: so, says Aboo-Turáb, I heard Mubtekir say.

                  <i>relates to bulls and cows particularly,</i> (S, Mgh, Msb,) or <i>to these and to sheep and goats,</i> (Msb,) and شنق [q. v.] to camels: (S, Mgh, Msb:) both signifying <i>what is between one</i> <br>\
                  فريضة <br>\
                  <i>and the next:</i> (S, Mgh, Msb: *) or, accord. to Aboo-&#39;Amr, (Mgh, L,) i. e. Esh-Sheybánee, (L,) وَقَصٌ signifies <i>camels for which it is incumbent to give sheep</i> or <i>goats in payment of the</i> <br>\
                  صَدَقَة, (Mgh, L,) <i>when the camels are between five and twenty in number;</i> (L;) but some disapprove of this: (Mgh, L:) accord. to  IB, it signifies <i>sheep</i> or <i>goats taken in payment of the</i> <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                   A man (S, Mgh) <i>short in the neck;</i> (S, A, Mgh, K;) <i>naturally so:</i> (TA:) or <i>having the neck inclining and short:</i> (A&#39;Obeyd, TA:) fem. وَقْصَا=ءُ. (A, TA.)       -A2-  خُدْ اَوْقَصَ الطَّرِيقَيْنِ (tropical:)  <i>Take thou the nearer of the two ways:</i> (Ibn- &#39;Abbád, K: *) or <i>shorter thereof.</i> (A, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>مَوْقُوصٌ</b>               1     <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                   A man (S) <i>having his neck broken:</i> (S, K:) and so مَوْقُوصُ العُنُقِ: (A:) the fem. is with ة: and ↓ <br>\
      وَاقِصَةٌ occurs in the sense of مَوْقُوصَةٌ in a trad. of &#39;Alee, in which he is said to have given judgment in the case of the قَارِصَة and the قَامِصَة and the ↓ <br>\
      وَاقِصَة, that the price of blood, or fine for homicide, should be paid in thirds; these being three girls, who were playing together, and mounted, one upon another; and the lowest pinched the middle one, who thereupon leaped off, so that the uppermost fell, and her neck broke; wherefore he imposed a third of the fine for the killing of the uppermost upon the lowest, and the like upon the middle one, annulling the third of the uppermost because she aided against herself: (Mgh, TA, in art. قرص, and Msb,) here, [accord. to those who hold that وَقَصَ is trans. only,] ↓ <br>\
      واقصة is like رَاضِيَةٌ, in the phrase عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ; (TA, in art. قرص and in the present art.;) and is used in the place of موقوصة for the sake of agreement in form with the two other epithets: (Mgh, in art. قرص, and Msb:) ↓ <br>\
      وَقِيصَةٌ, also, signifies <i>having her neck broken;</i> and its pl. is وَقَايِصُ. (Meyd, as in Freytag&#39;s Lex., excepting that the pl. is there written وَقَايِصُ.) You say also عُنُقٌ مَوْقُوصَةٌ <br>\
                  <i>A broken neck.</i> (Msb.) And مَوْقُوصٌ is also applied to a camel, signifying, <i>Become diseased in his back, and without motion.</i> (Khálid Ibn-Jembeh.)   </entryFree> <br>\
