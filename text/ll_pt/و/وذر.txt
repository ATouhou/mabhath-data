                  , of the same measure as وَسِعَهُ, (S, K, TA,) or وَذَرَهُ, (Lth, ISk, T, TA,) is the original pret. of which the aor. is يَذَرُهُ (Lth, ISk, T, S, K, TA) signifying, <i>He leaves, lets alone,</i> or <i>ceases</i> or <i>desists from, it,</i> or <i>him; he leaves it undone;</i> syn. يَدَعُهُ, (ISk, T, S, K, TA,) and يَتْرُكُهُ; (Msb;) imp. ذَرْهُ, syn. دَعْهُ: (ISk, T, S, K, TA:) but the pret. is not used, (Lth, Sb, ISk, T, S, M, Msb, K,) تَرَكَهُ being used in its stead; (Lth, T, S, TA;) and because its pret. is not used, the aor. is of the measure يَفْعَلُ; for if there were a pret., [it would most probably be of the measure فَعَلَ, as this is the regular measure of trans. unaugmented triliteral verbs, and] the aor. would be of the measure يَفْعُلُ or يَفْعِلُ: (Sb, M, TA:) nor is the inf. n. used, (Lth, T, M, Msb, K, TA,) تَرْكٌ being used in its stead, (Lth, T, M, TA,) i. e., instead of وَذْرٌ: (K:) nor is the act. part. n., (ISk, T, S, Msb, K,) namely وَاذِرٌ, instead of which تَارِكٌ is used: (ISk, T, S:) or the pret. is sometimes used, (Msb, K,) though rarely, (Msb,) or by the deviation from the constant course of speech: (K:) so in the K; but in the M it is said, that the phrase لَمْ اَذِرْ وَرَا=يِى <br>\
                  شَيْيًا [<i>I left not behind me anything,</i> with kesr to the ذ, and so in the original copy of the TT,] is related on the authority of some of the Arabs. (TA.) You say, ذَرْ ذَا and دَعْ ذَا [<i>Leave thou,</i> or <i>let alone,</i> or <i>cease</i> or <i>desist from, this</i>]. (ISk, T.) It is said in the Kur, [lxxiii. 11,] وَذَرْنِى <br>\
                  وَاْلْمُكَذِّبِينَ <br>\
                  <i>And leave me,</i> or <i>let me alone, with the beliers,</i> or <i>descrediters;</i> (Bd;) <i>commit their case to me,</i> (Bd, TA,) <i>and busy not thy heart respecting them;</i> (TA;) for I will stand thee in stead to recompense them. (Bd.)   </entryFree> <br>\
