                  , first pers. وَدِدْتُ, (S, M, L, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.) and وَدَدْتُ, (Ks, Z, K,) [but most disallow this] aor. يَوَدُّ, inf. n. وُدٌّ and وِدٌّ and وَدٌّ, (S, M, L, K,) of which three forms the first is the most common, (MF,) and مَوَدَّةٌ, (S, M, L, K,) or this last is a simple subst., (Msb,) and مِوَدَّةٌ (CK and some MS. copies of the K) and مَوِدَّةٌ, (accord. to some other copies of the K, this and the next preceding deviating from the common forms of inf. ns., TA,) and مَوْدِدَةٌ (M, Kz, K) and مَوْدَدَةٌ, (TA,) but these last two are allowable only in poetry, and deviate from constant rule, the former doubly, (Kz, MF, TA,) and وِدَادٌ and وَدَادٌ and وُدَادٌ, (M, L, K,) the first of which last three forms is the most common, (MF,) and وَدَادَةٌ (M, L, K) and, accord. to some, وِدَادَةٌ and وُدَادَةٌ, (MF, TA,) and, as in a copy of the K esteemed of good authority, مَوْدُودَةٌ, (TA,) <i>He loved,</i> or <i>affected, him,</i> or <i>it,</i> (S, M, L, Msb, K,) i. e. any means of attaining or doing good. (AZ, M, L.) The form وَدَدْتُ is disallowed by the Basrees who hold it to be erroneous: and Zj says, We know that Ks did not mention وَدَدْتُ without having heard it; but he heard it from him who was no authority. (T, L.) ―         -b2-  اَوْدِدْهُ, an imp. form [of ↓ <br>\
      اَوَدَّهُ], without idghám, accord. to the dial. of El-Hijáz, occurs in a trad., meaning <i>Love thou it,</i> or <i>affect it.</i> (L.) ―         -b3-  وَدِدْتُ لَوْ تَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ. and وَدَدْتُ لَوْ اَنَّكَ <br>\
                  تَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ, (S, L,) aor. as above, inf. n. وُدٌّ and وَدٌّ and وَدَادَةٌ (S, L, Msb) and وَدَادٌ (S, L) or وِدَادٌ, (T, in TT,) <i>I wished that thou wouldest do that.</i> (S, L.) ―         -b4-  وَدِدْتُ لَوْ كَانَ كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>I wished that it had been so.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b5-  وَدِدْتُ الشَّىْءَ <br>\
                  <i>I wished for the thing.</i> Fr says, This is the more approved form; but some say وَدَدْتُ: in both cases the aor. is يَوَدَّ only. (L.) [Respecting the latter form of the pret., see above.] This is a secondary signification of the verb. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
