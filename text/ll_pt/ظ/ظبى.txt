                  <i>A certain animal,</i> (TA,) <i>well known;</i> (S, Msb, K, TA;) the غَزَال [or <i>gazelle;</i> to which the former word is applied when used unrestrictedly, and which is app. here meant by the latter word, though this seems properly to signify “ a young gazelle ”]; (M;) [it is the <i>gazella dorcas,</i> also called <i>antilope dorcas,</i> of which the <i>ariel,</i> or <i>antilope Arabica,</i> is said to be a variety; or, accord. to some, each is a distinct species of gazelle: the name seems to be properly, but not always (as is shown by an explanation of رِيْمٌ), applied only to the <i>true antelope</i> of Arabia and adjacent countries, <i>as distinguished from the cervine and bovine antelopes:</i>] it is a name for the male; which is also called تَيْسٌ, when he has become what is termed a ثَنِىّ [q. v.], which he continues to be termed until he dies: (AHát, Msb, TA:) the <i>female</i> is called ظَبْيَةٌ, (AHát, T, M, Msb, K, TA,) and عَنْزٌ and مَاعِزَةٌ: (AHát, Msb, TA:) the dual is ظَبْيَانِ: (Msb, TA:) and the pl. is اَظْبٍ, (S, M, Msb, K,) originally اَظْبُىٌ, (S, Msb,) a pl. of pauc., (S,) and ظُبِىٌّ and ظِبَا=ءُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) which last is of the masc. and fem., (M, Msb,) and ظَبَيَاتٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) which is of the fem. (M, Msb.) One says, بِهِ <br>\
                  دَا=ءُ ظَبْىٍ [lit. <i>In him is the disease of a gazelle</i>]; meaning <i>in him is no disease;</i> as there is [said to be] no disease in the ظبى. (AA, T.) And لَكَ <br>\
                  عِنْدِى مِايَةٌ سِنَّ الظَّبْىِ [<i>To thee I owe a hundred</i> camels <i>of the age of the gazelle</i>], i. e., all of them ثُنْيَان [pl. of ثَنِىٌّ, q. v.], because the ظبى does not exceed what is termed اـِثْنَا=ءٌ. (M.) [See also a verse cited voce سِنٌّ; in which the phrase فَجَا=ءَتْ كَسِنِّ الظَّبْىِ means <i>And they came; like the age of the gazelle</i> was the age of every one of them.] It is said in a prov., ↓ <br>\
      لَاَتْرُكَنَّهُ تَرْكَ ظُبَىٍّ <br>\
                  ظِلَّهُ [<i>I will assuredly forsake him as a little gazelle forsakes the place of its shade</i>]; because the ظبى, when it leaves its covert, does not return to it: it is said in confirming the relinquishing of anything. (T. [See ظِلٌّ, where other relations of this prov. are mentioned.]) And in another prov., الظِّبَا=ءَ <br>\
                  عَلَى البَقَرِ, said when the tie of relationship and friendship between two men is severed, and it was used in the Time of Ignorance as a form of divorce: الظباء is in the accus. case by reason of اِخْتَرْتُ, or اِخْتَارَ, understood, [so that the meaning is I have preferred, or he has preferred, <i>the gazelles to the</i> wild <i>cows,</i>] by the بقر being meant the women: whence the saying, جَا=ءَ يَجُرُّ بَقَرَهُ [expl. in art. بقر]. (Meyd. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 61.]) And one says, اَتَيْتُهُ حِينَ <br>\
                  شَدَّ الظَّبْىَ ظِلُّهُ i. e. [<i>I came to him when its shade</i>] <i>confined the</i> <br>\
                  ظبى [or <i>gazelle</i>] by reason of the vehemence of the heat: or, as some relate it, حِينْ نَشَدَ الظَّبْىُ ظِلَّهُ, meaning طَلَبَهُ [i. e., <i>when the gazelle sought its shade</i>]. (TA.) And it is said in a trad., اـِذَا اَتَيْتَهُمْ فَاْرْبِضْ فِى دَارِهِمْ ظَبْيًا [expl. voce رَبَضَ]. (T, TA.) بِهِ لَا بِظَبْىٍ, (S, TA,) or بِهِ لَا بِظَبْىٍ اَعْفَرَ, a prov., meaning May this accident befall <i>him,</i> (لِيَنْزِلْ بِهِ هٰذِهِ الحَادِثَةُ,) <i>not a white antelope,</i> (Meyd,) is said on an occasion of rejoicing at another&#39;s affliction, (S, Meyd, TA,) by way of imprecation, i. e. may God make that which has befallen him to cleave to him. (S, TA. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i. 148.]) ―         -b2-  [الظِّبَا=ءُ and اَوْلَادُ الظِّبَا=ءِ are mentioned by Freytag as names of <i>Certain stars:</i> in relation to the former of which he refers to Ideler&#39;s “ Unters. ” pp. 20-21; and in relation to the latter, to the same work p. 21.] ―         -b3-  And الظَّبْىُ is the name of <i>A brand,</i> or <i>mark made with a hot iron, peculiar to some of the Arabs.</i> (T, K.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  شَاةٌ: and بَقَرَةٌ: but this is a great mistake, caused by a misunderstanding of what is cited in the passage here next following from the M.
