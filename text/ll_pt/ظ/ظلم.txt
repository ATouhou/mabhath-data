                     ظَلِمَ<br>\
                  , has for its inf. n. ظَلْمٌ, (M, Msb, K, and so in some copies of the S,) or ↓ <br>\
      ظُلْمٌ, (so in other copies of the S,) or both, (T,) or the latter is a simple subst., (T, M, Msb, TA,) which is put in the place of the inf. n., (TA, [and the same is indicated in the T and K by the saying that the proper inf. n. is with fet-h,]) and ↓ <br>\
      مَظْلِمَةٌ, (S, TA,) or this is likewise a simple subst., (Msb,) and ↓ <br>\
      مَظْلَمَةٌ, [or this also is a simple subst.,] and ↓ <br>\
      ظِلَامٌ also is said to be an inf. n. like ظُلْمٌ, these two being like لِبَاسٌ and لُبْسٌ, [or it is a simple subst. like as ظُلْمٌ is said to be, or it is an inf. n. of 3, as such occurring in the middle of this paragraph,] or, accord. to Kr, it is pl. of ظُلْمٌ [like as رِمَاحٌ is pl. of رُمْحٌ]: (TA:) [ظَلَمَ when intrans. generally means <i>He did wrong;</i> or <i>acted wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously,</i> or <i>tyrannically:</i> and when trans., <i>he wronged;</i> or <i>treated,</i> or <i>used, wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously,</i> or <i>tyrannically;</i> or <i>he misused:</i>] accord. to most of the lexicologists, (Er-Rághib, TA,) primarily, (As, T, S, Msb,) ↓ <br>\
      الظُّلْمُ signifies <i>the putting a thing in a place not its own; putting it in a wrong place; misplacing it:</i> (As, T, S, M, Er-Rághib, Msb, K:) and it is <i>by exceeding</i> or <i>by falling short,</i> or <i>by deviating from the proper time and place:</i> (Er-Rághib, TA:) or <i>the acting in whatsoever way one pleases in the disposal of the property of another:</i> and <i>the transgressing the proper limit:</i> (El-Munáwee, TA:) [i. e.] <i>the transgressing the proper limit much</i> or <i>little:</i> (Er-Rághib, TA:) or, accord. to some, it primarily signifies النَّقْص [as meaning <i>the making to suffer loss,</i> or <i>detriment</i>]: (MF, TA:) and it is said to be of three kinds, <i>between man and God,</i> and <i>between man and man,</i> and <i>between a man and himself;</i> every one of which three is really لِلنَّفْسِ [i. e. <i>a wrongdoing to oneself</i>]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [when it is used as a simple subst.,] the pl. of ظُلْمٌ, accord. to Kr. is ظِلَامٌ, as mentioned above, and ↓ <br>\
      ظُلَامٌ, with damm, is said to be syn. with ظُلْمٌ, or a pl. thereof, [of an extr. form, commonly regarded as that of a quasi-pl. n.,] like رُخَالٌ. (TA.) One says, مَنِ اْسْتَرْعَى الذِّيْبَ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ [<i>He who asks,</i> or <i>desires, the wolf to keep guard surely does wrong,</i> or <i>puts a thing in a wrong place</i>]: a prov. (S, Msb.) And مَنْ اَشْبَهَ اَبَاهُ فَمَا ظَلَمَ, (As, T, S,) a prov., meaning [<i>Whoso resembles his father</i> in a quality, or an attribute,] <i>he has not put the likeness in a wrong place.</i> (As, T. [See art. شبه.]) وَلَمْ <br>\
                  تَظْلِمْ مِنْهُ شَيْيًا, in the Kur [xviii. 31], means وَلَمْ تَنْقُصْ [i. e. <i>And made not aught thereof to suffer loss,</i> or <i>detriment</i>]: (M, K:) and in like manner Fr explains the saying in the Kur [ii. 54 and vii. 160], وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلٰكِنْ كَانُوا اَنْفُسَهُمْ <br>\
                  يَظْلِمُونَ <br>\
                  <i>And they made not us to suffer loss,</i> or <i>detriment,</i> by that which they did, <i>but themselves they made to suffer loss,</i> or <i>detriment:</i> (T, TA:) in which sense it seems to be indicated in the A that the verb is tropical. (TA.) ―         -b2-  It is also trans. by means of بِ; as in the phrase in the Kur [vii. 101 and xvii. 61] فَظَلَمُوا بِهَا, because the meaning is كَفَرُوا [i. e. <i>And they disbelieved in them</i>], referring to the ا=يَات [or <i>signs</i>]; (M, TA; *) the verb having this meaning tropically or by implication; or being thus made trans. because implying the meaning of التَّكْذِيب: or [the meaning is, and <i>they wronged</i> themselves, or the people, <i>because of them;</i> for], as some say, the ب is causative, and the objective complement, i. e. اَنْفُسَهُمْ, or النَّاسَ, is suppressed. (TA.) ―         -b3-  And it is doubly trans. by itself: (TA:) one says, ظَلَمَهُ حَقَّهُ [<i>He made him to suffer loss,</i> or <i>detriment, of his right,</i> or <i>due;</i> or <i>defrauded,</i> or <i>despoiled,</i> or <i>deprived, him of it</i>]; and حَقَّهُ ↓ <br>\
      تظلّمهُ: (M, K:) [and] you say, فُلَانٌ ↓ <br>\
      تَظَلَّمَنِى, [as well as تظلّمنى مَالِى, occurring in a verse cited in the M,] meaning ظَلَمَنِى مَالِى [i. e. <i>Such a one caused me to suffer loss,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>of my property</i>]. (S.) It is said in the Kur [iv. 44], اـِنَّ اْللّٰهَ لَا <br>\
                  يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ, for لَا يَظْلِمُهُمْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةِ, and the verb is made doubly trans. because the meaning is لَا يَسْلُبُهُمْ [i. e. <i>Verily God will not despoil them,</i> or <i>deprive them, of the weight of one of the smallest of ants,</i> or <i>a grub of an ant,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: or مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ, may be put in the place of the inf. n., for ظَلْمًا حَقِيرًا كَمِثْقَالِ ذَرَّةٍ [i. e. <i>with a paltry spoliation</i> or <i>deprivation, such as the weight of one of the smallest of ants,</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (M.) ―         -b4-  One says also, اَرَادَ ظِلَامَهُ and مُظَالَمَتَهُ, [these two nouns being inf. ns. of ↓ <br>\
      ظَالَمَهُ, or the former, as mentioned above, is, accord. to some, an inf. n. of ظَلَمَ,] meaning ظُلْمَهُ or ظَلْمَهُ [i. e. <i>He desired the wronging,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>of him</i>]. (M, K.) ―         -b5-  ظَلَمَهُ, inf. n. ظُلْمٌ [or ظَلْمٌ?], also means <i>He imposed upon him a thing that was above his power,</i> or <i>ability.</i> (TA.) And يُظْلَمُ <br>\
                  <i>He is asked for a thing that is above his power,</i> or <i>ability.</i> (S.) ―         -b6-  And one says, ظَلَمَ البَعِيرَ (tropical:)  <i>He slaughtered the camel without disease.</i> (S, K, TA.) And ظُلِمَتِ النَّاقَةُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The she-camel was slaughtered without disease:</i> or <i>was covered without her desiring the stallion.</i> (M.) And ظَلَمَ الحِمَارُ الاَتَانَ (tropical:)  <i>The he-ass leaped the she-ass</i> (K, TA) <i>before her time:</i> (TA:) or <i>when she was pregnant:</i> (K, TA:) so in the A. (TA.) ―         -b7-  And ظَلَمَ الوَطْبَ, (S, K,) inf. n. ظُلْمٌ [or ظَلْمٌ?], (S,) (tropical:)  <i>He gave to drink of the milk of his skin before its becoming thick</i> (S, K, TA) <i>and its butter&#39;s coming forth.</i> (TA. [And the like is said in the T and M.]) And ظَلَمَ القَوْمَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He gave to drink to the people,</i> or <i>party,</i> (T, M, K,) <i>milk before it had attained to maturity,</i> (T, K,) as related on the authority of A &#39;Obeyd, (T,) or [<i>milk such as is termed</i>] ظَلِيمَة: (M:) but this is a mistake: it is related on the authority of Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà [i. e. Th] and AHeyth that one says, ظَلَمْتُ السِّقَا=ءَ, and اللَّبَنَ, meaning <i>I drank,</i> or <i>gave to drink, what was in the skin,</i> and <i>the milk, before its attaining to maturity and the extracting of its butter:</i> accord. to ISk, one says, ظَلَمْتُ وَطْبِىَ القَوْمَ, [but I think that it is correctly ظَلَمْتُ وَطْبِى لِلْقَومِ, agreeably with a verse cited in the T and M,] meaning <i>I gave to drink</i> [<i>to the people,</i> or <i>party,</i>] <i>the contents of my milk-skin before the thickening thereof.</i> (T.) And ظَلَمْتُهُ is said of anything as meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>I did it hastily,</i> or <i>hurriedly, before its proper time,</i> or <i>season.</i> (M, TA.) ―         -b8-  ظَلَمْتُ الحَوْضَ means (assumed tropical:)  <i>I made the watering-trough in a place in which watering-troughs should not be made.</i> (ISk, T.) And ظَلَمَ الاَرْضَ means (tropical:)  <i>He dug the ground in what was not the place of digging:</i> (M, K, TA:) or <i>when it had not been dug before.</i> (M.) And, said of a torrent, (assumed tropical:)  <i>It furrowed the earth in a place that was not furrowed.</i> (T.) And ظَلَمَ <br>\
                  البِطَاحَ, said of a torrent, (tropical:)  <i>It reached the</i> <br>\
                  بطاح [or <i>wide water-courses containing fine,</i> or <i>broken, pebbles,</i> &amp;amp;c.], <i>not having reached them before.</i> (A, TA.) And ظَلَمَ الوَادِى (tropical:)  <i>The water of the valley reached a place that it had not reached before.</i> (Fr, T, S, K, TA.) ―         -b9-  When men have added upon the grave other than its own earth, لَا تَظْلِمُوا (tropical:)  [<i>Transgress not ye the proper limit</i>] is said to them. (TA.) ―         -b10-  And one says, لَا <br>\
                  تَظْلِمْ وَضَحَ الطَّرِيقِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Turn not thou from the main part,</i> or <i>the beaten track, of the road.</i> (M.) And لَا تَظْلِمْ عَنْهُ شَيْيَا (assumed tropical:)  <i>Turn not thou from it at all.</i> (T.) And لَزِمَ الطَّرِيقَ فَلَمْ يَظْلِمْهُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He kept to the road, and</i>] <i>did not turn from it to the right and left.</i> (TA.) ―         -b11-  And مَا ظَلَمَكَ <br>\
                  اَنْ تَفْعَلَ (T, K, TA) (tropical:)  <i>What has prevented thy doing</i> (K, TA) such a thing? (TA.) A man complained to Abu-l-Jarráh of his suffering indigestion from food that he had eaten, and he said to him, مَا ظَلَمَكَ اَنْ تَقِىْءَ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>What has prevented thy vomiting?</i>]. (Fr, T.) And one says, مَا ظَلَمَكَ عَنْ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  <i>What has prevented thee from such a thing?</i> (T.) Respecting the saying <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [addressed by a man to a woman who had invited him to visit her], Fr says, they say that the meaning is حَقًّا [<i>Truly,</i> or <i>in truth;</i> i. e. <i>He said, Yes, O Meiya, truly,</i> or <i>in truth,</i> I will visit thee]; and it is a prov.; (T;) or اليَوْمُ ظَلَمَ, or بَلَى وَاليَوْمُ ظَلَمَ, is a prov.; (Meyd;) and thus it was expl. by IAar, as used in the manner of an oath: but Fr says, in my opinion the meaning is, <i>and a day in which is a cause of prevention shall not prevent me:</i> [so that the words of the hemistich above may be rendered, <i>he said, Yes, O Meiya, though the day present an obstacle,</i> for I will overcome every obstacle]: (T:)  accord. to Kr, قَدِمَ فُلَانٌ وَاليَوْمُ ظَلَمَ means <i>Such a one came truly,</i> or <i>in truth:</i> [or it may be rendered <i>such a one came though the day presented an obstacle:</i>] but in the saying <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

It is said in the Kur [ii. 19], وَاـِذَا اَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ قَامُوا [<i>And when it becomes dark to them they stand still</i>]; the verb being intrans.: or, accord. to the Ksh, and Bd follows it, it may be trans. [so that the meaning is, <i>and when He makes</i> their place <i>dark</i> &amp;amp;c.]; as is shown by another reading, which is اُظْلِمُوا: accord. to AHei, it is known by transmission as only intrans.; but Z makes it to be trans. by itself; Ibn-Es-Saláh affirms it to be trans. and intrans.: and Az [so in the TA, but correctly ISd, in the M,] mentions the saying, تَكَلَّمَ فَاَظْلَمَ <br>\
                  عَلَيْنَا البَيعتَ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He spoke, and made dark to us the house,</i> or <i>chamber,</i> or <i>tent</i>], meaning he made us to hear what we disliked, or hated, the verb being trans. (TA.) ―         -b2-  And اَظْلَمُوا <br>\

(M.) [In the K, next after the explanation of اظلم الثَّغْرُ given above, it is added that اظلم said of a man signifies اَصَابَ ظَلْمًا: thus, with fet-h, to the ظ, accord. to the TA: in my MS. copy of the K and in the CK, ظُلْمًا, which is doubtless a mistranscription.]    </entryFree> <br>\
