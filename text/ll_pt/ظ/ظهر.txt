                  , (Msb,) inf. n. ظُهُورٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.,) [<i>It was,</i> or <i>became, outward, exterior, external, extrinsic,</i> or <i>exoteric:</i> and hence,] <i>it appeared; became apparent, overt, open, perceptible</i> or <i>perceived, manifest, plain,</i> or <i>evident;</i> (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) <i>after having been concealed,</i> or <i>latent:</i> (Msb, TA:) and ↓ <br>\
      تظاهر signifies the same. (Har p. 85.) Hence the phrase ظَهَرَ لِى رَاْىٌ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>An idea,</i> or <i>opinion, occurred to me</i>], said when one knows what he did not know before. (Msb.) [And هٰذَا مَا يَظْهَرُ لِى (assumed tropical:)  <i>This is what appears to me</i> to be the case, or to be the right way or course; or <i>this is my opinion.</i>] ظَهَرَ الحَمْلُ, inf. n. as above, means <i>Pregnancy became apparent,</i> or <i>manifest:</i> it is said that this is not the case in less than three months. (Msb.) And it is said in a trad. of &#39;Áïsheh, كَانَ يُصَلِّى العَصْرَ <br>\
                  فِى حُجْرَتِى قَبْلَ اَنْ تَظْهَرَ i. e. [<i>He used to perform the prayer of the afternoon in my chamber</i>] <i>before it</i> (meaning the sun) <i>became high and apparent:</i> (TA:) or وَالشَّمْسُ فِى حُجْرَتِى لَمْ تَظْهَرْ <br>\
                  بَعْدُ i. e. [<i>when the sun was in my chamber,</i>] <i>it not having risen high</i> so as to be on the flat roof [thereof]: referring to the Prophet. (O. [But العَصْرَ must be a mistranscription for الفَجْرَ, i. e. <i>the prayer of the dawn.</i>]) The saying in the Kur [xxiv. 31], وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ اـِلَّا مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا [which is app. best rendered <i>And that they discover not their ornature except what is external thereof</i>] has been expl. in seven different ways, most correctly as meaning the clothes: (O, TA:) accord. to &#39;Áïsheh, it means the bracelet (القُلْب) and the ring (الفَتَخَة): and accord. to I&#39;Ab, the hand and the signet-ring and the face. (TA.) ―         -b2-  Also <i>He went forth,</i> or <i>out,</i> (Mgh, TA,) <i>to the outside of a place.</i> (O, TA.) ―         -b3-  And <i>He</i> (a bird) <i>migrated,</i> or <i>went down,</i> from one country or region to another: used in this sense by AHn in relation to the vulture, migrating to Nejd. (L.) ―         -b4-  ظَهَرَ عَنْهُ, said of a vice, or fault, (O, TA,) or a disgrace, (JK, A, O,) (tropical:)  <i>It did not cleave to him;</i> (A, O, TA;) <i>it was remote from him;</i> (TA;) <i>it quitted him,</i> or <i>departed from him.</i> (JK.) ―         -b5-  ظَهَرْتُ بِهِ, (O, TA,) inf. n. ظَهْرٌ, (K,) (assumed tropical:)  <i>I gloried,</i> or <i>boasted, by reason of it.</i> (O, K * TA.) [Respecting a meaning assigned to ظَهَرَ <br>\
                  بِفُلَانٍ in the K, see 4.] ―         -b6-  اَكَلَ الرَّجُلُ اُكْلَةً <br>\
                  ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا ظَهْرَةً means (assumed tropical:)  [<i>The man ate some food</i>] <i>in consequence of which</i>] <i>he became fat.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  ظَهَرَهُ <br>\
                  <i>He mounted it; went,</i> or <i>got, upon it,</i> or <i>upon the top of it;</i> (S, A, * Mgh, O, Msb, K;) as also ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ; (O;) namely, a house, (S,) or a house-top, (A, Mgh, O,) and a mountain, (A,) and a wall; (O, Msb;) properly, <i>he became upon its back:</i> (Mgh:) and [in like manner] one says, فُلَانٌ نَجْدًا ↓ <br>\
      ظَهَّرَ, inf. n. تَظْهِيرٌ, <i>Such a one mounted,</i> or <i>went up, upon the high region</i> (ظَهْر) <i>of Nejd.</i> (O.) ―         -b2-  Hence, (Mgh, Msb,) ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and بِهِ, (K,) inf. n. ظُهُورٌ (Bd in xxiv. 31) and ظَهْرٌ also, (Ham p. 301,) <i>He overcame, conquered, subdued, overpowered,</i> or <i>mastered, him; gained the mastery</i> or <i>victory,</i> or <i>prevailed, over him;</i> (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) namely, his enemy; (Msb;) and in like manner, [<i>he conquered, won, achieved,</i> or <i>attained, it,</i> i. e.] a thing. (O, TA.) [The saying فُلَانٌ لَا يَظْهَرُ <br>\
                  عَلَيْهِ اَحَدٌ is expl. in the L and TA by the words اى لا يَسْلَم, and said to be tropical: but Ibr D thinks that the correct reading is لا يُسَلِّمُ, from التَّسْلِيمُ; and that it is said of one who will not give up, or resign, what is in his hand; so that the meaning is, (tropical:)  <i>Such a one is a person whom no one will overcome in respect of that which he holds in his possession.</i>] ―         -b3-  And [hence also] ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. ظُهُورٌ, (TA,) <i>He knew, became acquainted with,</i> or <i>got knowledge of, him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (Msb, TA.)

                  عورات, (Bd, Jel,) meaning [<i>pudenda,</i> or] <i>parts between the navel and the knee,</i> (Jel,) <i>of women,</i> by reason of their want of discrimination: (Bd:) or (tropical:)  <i>who have not attained to the generative faculty;</i> (O, Bd, * TA;) from الظُّهُورُ in the sense of الغَلَبَةُ. (Bd.) So too in the Kur [xviii. 19], اـِنْ يَظْهَرُوا عَلَيْكُمْ <br>\
                  <i>If they get knowledge of you.</i> (O, TA.) ―         -b4-  And [hence] ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ, (Fr, A, O, TA,) and ↓ <br>\

The phrase ظاهر بِدِرْعَيْنِ requires consideration; and the ب in it should be regarded as meant to denote conjunction; not as a part of the necessary complement of the verb. (Mgh.) ظاهر الدِّرْعَ is said to signify لَاَمَ بَعْضَهَا عَلَى بَعْضٍ [app. meaning <i>He folded over and fastened one part of the coat of mail upon another</i>]. (TA.) And ظاهر عَلَيْهِ <br>\

                  كَرُكُوبِ اُمِّى لِلنِّكَاحِ; the back being specified in preference to the بَطْن or فَخِذ or فَرْج because the woman is likened to a beast that is ridden, and the act of نِكَاح to that of رُكُوب: the phrase being a form of divorce used by the Arabs in the Time of Ignorance.

(S and TA in art. قلب.) [Hence,] قَلَبْتُ الاَرْضَ ظَهْرًا لِبَطْنٍ (tropical:)  [<i>I turned the earth over, upside-down</i>]. (A.) And [hence,] قَلَّبَ اَمْرَهُ ظَهْرًا لِبَطْنٍ, (O, * TA,) and ظَهْرَهُ لِبَطْنٍ, and ظَهْرَهُ لِبَطْنِهِ, and ظَهْرَهُ لِلْبَطْنِ, which last form is preferred by El-Farezdak to the second, because [as in the third form] the second of the two words is determinate like the first word, (tropical:)  <i>He meditated,</i> or <i>managed, the affair with forecast, and well.</i> (O, * TA.) ―         -b14-  The Arabs used to say, هٰذَا ظَهْرُ السَّمَا=ءِ and هذا بَطْنُ <br>\
                  السَّمَا=ءِ, both meaning (tropical:)  <i>This is the apparent, visible, part of the sky.</i> (Fr, Az.) And the like is said of the side of a wall, which is its بَطْن to a person on the same side, and its ظَهْر to one on the other side.

(TA.) [See also بَطْنٌ.] ―         -b16-  ظَهْرٌ signifies also (tropical:)  <i>Camels on which people ride, and which carry goods;</i> (S, * A, * O, K, * TA;) <i>camels that carry burdens upon their backs in journeying:</i> (TA:) [or] <i>a beast:</i> or <i>a camel for riding:</i> (Mgh:) pl. ظُهْرَانٌ. (TA.) It is said in a trad. of &#39;Arfajeh, فَتَنَاوَلَ <br>\
                  السَّيْفَ مِنَ الظَّهْرِ <br>\
                  <i>And he reached,</i> or <i>took in his hand, the sword from the camels for carrying burdens and for riding:</i> and in another, اَتَاْذَنُ <br>\

And one says also, هُوَ عَلَى ظَهْرٍ (tropical:)  <i>He is determined upon travel:</i> (K:) as though he had already mounted a beast for that purpose. (TA.) ―         -b17-  [Hence, app.,] (assumed tropical:)  <i>Property consisting of camels and sheep</i> or <i>goats:</i> (TA:) or <i>much property.</i> (K, TA.) ―         -b18-  (assumed tropical:)  The <i>short side</i> [or <i>lateral half</i>] <i>of a feather:</i> (S, O, K:) pl. ظُهْرَانٌ: (S, M, K, TA, &amp;amp;c.:) opposed to بَطْنٌ, sing. of بُطْنَانٌ, (TA,) which latter signifies the “ long sides: ” (S, TA:) and ↓ <br>\
      ظُهَارٌ signifies the same as ظَهْرٌ, (K,) or the same as ظُهْرَانٌ, being an irregular pl.; and this is meant by the saying الظُّهَارُ بِالضَّمِ الجَمَاعَةُ, mentioned in a later place in the K [in such a manner as to have led to the supposition that ظُهَارٌ is also syn. with جَمَاعَةٌ]: (TA:) AO says that among the feathers of arrows are the ظُهَار, which are <i>those that are put</i> [<i>upon an arrow</i>] <i>of the</i> <br>\
                  ظَهْر [or <i>outer side</i>] <i>of the</i> <br>\

One says, رِشْ سَهْمَكَ بِظُهْرَانٍ وَلَا تَرِشْهُ بِبُطْنَانٍ [<i>Feather thine arrow with short sides of feathers, and feather it not with long sides of feathers</i>]. (S, TA.) [De Sacy supposes that ظُهُورٌ and بُطُونٌ are also pls. of ظَهْرٌ and بَطْنٌ thus used: (see his “ Chrest. Arabe, ” sec. ed., tome ii., p. 374:) but his reasons do not appear to me to be conclusive.] ↓ <br>\
      ظُهَارٌ and ظُهْرَانٌ are also used as epithets: you say, رِيشٌ ظُهَارٌ and رِيشٌ ظُهْرَانٌ. (TA.) ―         -b19-  [ظَهْرُ الكَفِّ and ↓ <br>\

And ظَهْرُ اللِّسَانِ means (assumed tropical:)  <i>The upper surface of the tongue.</i>] ―         -b20-  And ظَهْرٌ also signifies (tropical:)  <i>A way by land.</i> (S, M, O, Msb, K.) This expression is used when there is a way by land and a way by sea. (M.) You say, سَارُوا <br>\
                  فِى طَرِيقِ الظَّهْرِ (tropical:)  <i>They journeyed by land.</i> (A.) ―         -b21-  And (assumed tropical:)  <i>An elevated tract</i> of land or ground; as also ↓ <br>\
      ظَاهِرةٌ: (A:) or <i>rugged and elevated land</i> or <i>ground;</i> (JK, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      ظَاهِرَةٌ: (JK:) opposed to بَطْنٌ, which signifies “ soft and plain and fine and low land or ground: ” (TA:) and ↓ <br>\
      ظَوَاهِرُ [pl. of. ظَاهِرَةٌ] signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>elevated tracts</i> of land or ground: (S, K:) you say, هَاجَتْ ظَوَاهِرُ الاَرْضِ, meaning, (assumed tropical:)  <i>the herbs,</i> or <i>leguminous plants, of the elevated tracts of land,</i> or <i>ground, dried up:</i> (As, S, L:) and ↓ <br>\
      ظَاهِرٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>the higher,</i> or <i>highest, part</i> of a mountain; (ISh, L, TA;) whether its exterior be plain or not: (TA:) and ↓ <br>\
      ظَاهِرَةٌ, the same, of anything: (L:) when you have ascended upon the ظَهْر of a mountain, you are upon its ظَاهِرَة. (TA.) ―         -b22-  سَالَ وَادِيهِمْ ظَهْرًا means (assumed tropical:)  <i>Their valley flowed with the rain of their own land:</i> opposed to دُرْءًا, meaning, “ from other rain: ” (IAar, O, K: *) or the former signifies <i>their valley flowed</i> <br>\
                  <i>with its own rain:</i> and the latter, “ with other than its own rain: ” (TA:) and some say ↓ <br>\
      ظُهْرًا, which Az thinks the better form. (O, TA.) ―         -b23-  [Hence, probably,] اَصَبْتُ مِنْهُ مَطَرَ ظَهْرٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>I obtained from him,</i> or <i>it, much good.</i> (Sgh, O, K.) ―         -b24-  And another signification of ظَهْرٌ is <i>What is absent,</i> or <i>hidden,</i> or <i>concealed, from one.</i> (O, K.) ―         -b25-  It is sometimes prefixed to another noun to give plainness and force to the expression; as in ظَهْرُ الغَيْبِ and ظَهْرُ القَلْبِ, meaning نَفْسُ الغَيْبِ and نَفْسُ القَلْبِ: (Msb:) or it is redundant in these instances. (Mgh.) Lebeed says, describing a [wild] cow going about after a beast of prey that had eaten her young one, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
