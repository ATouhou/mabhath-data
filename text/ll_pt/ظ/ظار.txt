                  <i>is inserted, the space between the two edges of her vulva is closed by a thong</i> [<i>passed round the extremities of the two pointed pieces of wood</i>]. (T, TA.) It is said in a trad., of &#39;Omar, (T,) or Ibn-&#39;Omar, (S, TA,) that he purchased a she-camel, and, seeing in her the laceration on the occasion of ظِيْار, returned her.

(TA.) It is said in a prov., الطَّعْنُ يَظْاَرُ, meaning, <i>Thrusting,</i> or <i>piercing, with the spear inclines</i> [one&#39;s enemies] <i>to peace:</i> (As, T, A, K:) J says يَظْاَرُهُ, as also IKtt, which F disapproves; but others approve it: or the reading of the S is ↓ <br>\
      يُظْيِرُهُ. (TA.) The Arabs also said, الطَّعْنُ ظِيَارُ قَوْمٍ (M, K) <i>Thrusting,</i> or <i>piercing, with the spear is a means of inclining a people to peace;</i> (K;) meaning, make people to fear, that they may love thee. (M, K.) It is also said, in a trad. of &#39;Alee, اَظْاَرُكُمْ اـِلَى الحَقِّ وَاَنْتُمْ تَفِرُّونَ مِنْهُ, [perhaps a mistake for على الحقّ,] <i>I incline you</i> [or <i>I endeavour to turn you</i>] <i>to the truth, and ye flee from it.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  ظَاَرَتْ, (S, K,) [of which ظُوُورَةٌ, q. v., appears to be an inf. n.; or you say ظَاَرَتْ عَلَى وَلَدِ غَيْرِهَا, and عَلَى بَوٍّ;] and ↓ <br>\
