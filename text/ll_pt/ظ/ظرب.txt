      ظِرِبَا=ء accord. to two different copies of the K) <i>A small, stinking beast,</i> (AZ, S, M, Msb, K,) <i>resembling a cat,</i> (AZ, S, M, K,) or <i>resembling a short Chinese dog,</i> (Msb,) or <i>resembling an ape</i> or <i>a monkey,</i> (AA, T, M, TA,) or <i>above the whelp of a dog,</i> (El-Mustaksee, TA,) <i>that often emits a noiseless wind from the anus;</i> (M, Msb, * TA;) said by Az, on the authority of the handwriting of AHeyth, to be <i>a beast that has small legs, their length being that of half a finger, but which is broad, its breadth being equal to the space measured by the extension of the thumb and the little finger,</i> or <i>of the thumb and the fore finger, and its length being a cubit, having a compact head, and its ears</i> [for ادناه, in my original, I read اُذُنَاهُ] <i>being like the cat&#39;s;</i> (TA;) <i>it is small and short in the ears,</i> (اَصْلَمُ <br>\

                  ظربان], meaning that he had struck Ketheer Ibn-Shiháb (S, M, TA) El-Medh-hijee upon his face; for the ظربان has a line, or long mark, upon his face; and he likens the blow that he inflicted upon his face to that mark: [see مَضْرِبٌ:] and the same words of the latter hemistich, except that عُبَيْدًا is substituted in them for كَثِيرًا, occur in a verse of Asad Ibn-Nághisah, who slew &#39;Obeyd by order of En-Noamán.

                  <i>emitted a noiseless wind from its anus among us,</i> or <i>among them,</i>] a prov., (S,) meaning that we, or they, became disunited, and alienated, one from another: [for] when this animal emits a noiseless wind from its anus in the garment of a man, the stink does not go away until the garment wears out: (S, Msb, K:) the Arabs of the desert assert that it does so in the garment of him who hunts it: (S:) and it is said to do so in the hole of the [lizard called] ضَبّ, which, being stupified by the foulness of the stink, is taken and eaten by it. (M, K, TA.) One says also, تَشَاتَمَا فَكَاَنَّمَا جَزَرَا بَيْنَهُمَا ظَرِبَانًا [<i>They reviled each other, and it was as though they slaughtered between them a</i> <br>\
                  ظربان]: the foulness of their reviling being likened to the stink of that animal. (M, TA.) And يَتَنَازَعَانِ جِلْدَ الظَّرِبَانِ <br>\

                  ظربان, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>they revile each other:</i> (M, TA:) and يَتَمَاشَنَانِ جِلْدَ الظَّرِبَانِ <br>\
                  <i>They wipe their hands together upon the skin of the</i> <br>\

                  اللِّجَامِ signifies <i>the knots that are at the extremities of the bit.</i> (M, TA.) J cites the following verse, ascribing it to &#39;Ámir Ibn-Et-Tufeyl, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\

                   [accord. to the TA مُظَرِّبَةٌ, but this is evidently a mistake (see 2),] means [<i>Solid hoofs</i>] <i>that have become hard and strong:</i> (K, TA:) [but] accord. to El-Mufaddal, المُظَرَّبُ, like مُعَظَّم [in measure], signifies اْلَّذِى قَدْ لَوَّحَتْهُ <br>\
