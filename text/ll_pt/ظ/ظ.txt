                  <i>The seventeenth letter of the alphabet:</i> called ظَا=ءٌ [and ظَا]. (TA.) It is a letter peculiar to the Arabic language; and is one of the letters termed مَجْهُورَة [or vocal, i. e. pronounced with the voice, not with the breath only]; and of the letters termed لِثَوِيَّة [or gingival], like ث and ذ. (TA.) As it does not exist in the language of the Nabathæans, they change it into ط. (IF, TA.) [It is substituted for the ت in the measure اِفْتَعَلَ and the forms inflected therefrom when immediately following ظ; as in اِظَّلَمَ, for اِظْظَلَمَ, for اِظْتَلَمَ:] and it is substituted for ذ; as in تَرَكْتُهُ <br>\
                  وَقِيذًا and وَقِيظًا; as is related on the authorities of ISk and Kr; and as in اَرْضٌ جِلْذَا=ءٌ and جِلْظَا=ءٌ, as is mentioned in the Nawádir el-Aaráb. (TA.)       -A2-  [As a numeral, it denotes <i>Nine hundred.</i>]   </entryFree> <br>\
