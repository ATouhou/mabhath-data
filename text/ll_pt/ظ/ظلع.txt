                     ظَلَعَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. ظَلْعٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) said of a camel, (S, O, Msb, K,) and of a man also, (Msb, TA,) and, by Aboo-Dhu-eyb, of a horse, (S, TA,) [and likewise said of a dog, (see ظَالِعٌ,)] <i>He limped,</i> or <i>halted,</i> syn. غَمَزَ فِى <br>\
                  مَشْيِهِ, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) and عَرِجَ; (TA;) or <i>was slightly lame:</i> (Mgh:) what it signifies resembles عَرَجٌ [or natural lameness], and therefore it is said to be a slight عَرَج. (Msb.) One says, اِرْقَ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ, (S, O, L, K,) a prov., (O, L,) meaning <i>Ascend thou</i> the mountain <i>with knowledge</i> [or <i>because</i>] <i>of thy limping,</i> or <i>slight lameness, not jading thyself:</i> (L:) or <i>deal gently with thyself, and burden not thyself with more than thou art able to do:</i> (S:) or <i>impose upon thyself, of what is difficult,</i> [<i>only</i>] <i>what thou art able to do;</i> for he who ascends a ladder or stair, or a mountain, when he is one who limps, or has a slight lameness, deals gently with himself; i. e. <i>exceed not thy proper limit in thy threatening, but see thy deficiency, and thine impotence to execute it:</i> (O, K: *) and some say اِرْقَاْ, with, meaning <i>rectify thine affair first;</i> (O, K;) or as meaning <i>abstain, and restrain thyself;</i> (O;) or, accord. to AZ, <i>abstain thou, for I know thy vices,</i> or <i>faults:</i> (TA:) or the meaning of both is, <i>be silent, because,</i> or <i>in consideration, of the fault that is in thee.</i> (Ks, O, K. *) One says also, اِرْقِ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ, with kesr to the ق, [meaning <i>Charm thou thy slight lameness, to cure it,</i>] from الرُّقْيَةُ: and it is said in another prov., <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        اِرْقِ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ اَنْ يُهَاضَا<br>\
                  </quote> [app. meaning <i>Charm thou thy slight lameness, that it may become mitigated:</i> see art. هيض: the final ا in يهاضا being what is termed اَلِفُ الاـِطْلَاقِ, not a radical]. (O, K.) And قِ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ [<i>Be cautious, because,</i> or <i>in consideration, of thy limping</i>]: said when there is a vice, or fault, in a man, and you chide him in order that it may not be called to mind: (O, K: [for يَذْكُرَ in the CK, I read يُذْكَرَ, as in other copies of the K and in the O:]) and to this he replies, or may reply, وَقَيْتُ. (TA. [See also art. وقى.]) And اِرْبَعْ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ [<i>Act gently,</i> or <i>with deliberation,</i> or <i>restrain thyself, because of thy limping</i>]; meaning thou art weak; therefore refrain from that which thou art not able to do. (O, K. [See also art. ربع.]) And لَا يَرْبَعُ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ مَنْ لَيْسَ <br>\
                  يَحْزُنُهُ اَمْرُكَ, meaning <i>He will not mind thine affair</i> (Hr, O, K) <i>whom thy condition does not grieve:</i> (Hr, O:) or, originally, <i>he will not pause because of thy limping,</i> when thou laggest behind thy companions on account of thy weakness, <i>who does not care for thy case.</i> (Hr, O, K. * [See, again, art. ربع.]) ―         -b2-  Also, said of a man, (tropical:)  <i>He stopped short,</i> and <i>lagged behind.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  ظَلَعَتِ الاَرْضُ بِاَهْلِهَا (tropical:)  <i>The land became straitened with its inhabitants, by reason of their multitude;</i> (A &#39;Obeyd, S, O, K;) <i>it would not bear them, by reason of their multitude, like the beast that limps with its load because of its heaviness.</i> (Z, TA.)  ―         -b4-  ظَلَعَت said of a bitch, (tropical:)  <i>She desired copulation.</i> (As, O, K, TA.) And ظَلَعَ said of a dog, (assumed tropical:)  <i>He desired to copulate.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  ظَلَعَتْ عَيْنَهَا <br>\
                  <i>She</i> (a woman) <i>contracted and inclined her eye.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
