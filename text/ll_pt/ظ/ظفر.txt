(TA.) The phrase كُلَّ ذِى ظُفُرٍ in the Kur vi. 147 comprises camels and ostriches; (so in the T and TS and L; but in the K, الاَنْعَام is erroneously put for النَّعَام; TA;) because their مَنَاسِم are like اَظْفَار to them: (T, K, TA:) I&#39;Ab says that it comprises camels; and also ostriches, because they have nails like camels: or any bird that has a مِخْلَب, and any beast that has a solid hoof: or, accord. to Mujáhid and Katádeh, every beast and bird that has not divided toes; as the camel and ostrich and goose and duck.

                  اَظْفَار [properly so called]; they are said by [the Arabic translator of] Dioscorides to be <i>of the nature of the shards of shells,</i> [so I render مِنْ جِنْسِ اَخْزَافِ الصَّدَفِ, supposing اخزاف to be here used tropically,] <i>found in an island of the Sea of India where is the</i> <br>\
