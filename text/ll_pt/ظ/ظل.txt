                  فُلَانٌ نَهَارَهُ صَايِمًا [<i>Such a one was during his day fasting;</i> or <i>he passed his day fasting</i>]: (Lth, T:) and ظَلَّ نَهَارَهُ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا [<i>He was in,</i> or <i>during, his day doing such a thing;</i> or <i>he passed his day doing such a thing</i>]: (M, K:) and ظَلِلْتُ اَعْمَلُ <br>\

                  لَيْلَهُ occurs in poetry; (M, K, TA;) so that one says, ظَلَّ لَيْلَهُ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا [<i>He was in,</i> or <i>during, his night,</i> or <i>he passed his night, doing such a thing</i>]: but it is said that in this case the verb has the meaning next following. (TA.) ―         -b2-  And it signifies also <i>He,</i> or <i>it, became;</i> syn. صَارَ: (Er-Rághib, TA:) being in this sense likewise an incomplete [i. e. a non-attributive] verb, divested of that meaning of time which it radically denotes; as in the phrase in the Kur [xvi. 60 and xliii. 16], ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدًّا [<i>His face becomes black</i>]: so says Ibn-Málik: (TA:) or this may mean <i>his face continues all the day black:</i> (Bd in xvi. 60:) and one says also, ظَلَّ <br>\
                  يَفْعَلُ كَذَا meaning <i>He continued doing such a thing:</i> this too is mentioned by Ibn-Málik, and is of the dial. of the people of Syria. (TA.) ―         -b3-  It is also a complete [i. e. an attributive] verb as meaning <i>He,</i> or <i>it, continued;</i> as is said in the Expos. of the “ Shifè, ” and by Ibn-Málik; and, as Ibn-Málik likewise says, <i>it was,</i> or <i>became, long.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

(S, O.)       -A2-  See also 4.       -A3-  One says also ظلّل بِالسَّوْطِ, meaning <i>He made a sign with the whip for the purpose of frightening.</i> (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)    </entryFree> <br>\

(S, O.) اَظَلَّكَ said of a building, or of a mountain, or of a cloud, means <i>It protected thee,</i> and <i>cast its shade upon thee.</i> (Mgh.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] اظلّهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He took him into his shelter,</i> or <i>protection:</i> (TA:) or <i>he guarded,</i> or <i>protected, him,</i> and <i>placed him within the scope of his might,</i> or <i>power of resistance</i> or <i>defence.</i> (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―         -b3-  And اَظَلَّنِى (assumed tropical:)  <i>It</i> (a thing) <i>covered me:</i> (M, K:) or <i>it approached me,</i> or <i>drew near to me, so as to cast its shade upon me:</i> (K:) or it has both of these meanings: (M:) or اَظَلَّكَ means <i>he,</i> (T, S,) or <i>it,</i> (O,) <i>approached thee,</i> or <i>drew near to thee, as though he,</i> or <i>it, cast his,</i> or <i>its, shade upon thee.</i> (T, S, O.)

                   properly signifies <i>Shade;</i> i. e. the <i>light of the sun without the rays:</i> when there is no light, it is ظُلْمَةٌ, not ظِلٌّ: (S, O:) <i>contr. of</i> <br>\

                  <i>from the beginning of the day to the declining of the sun;</i> after which it is termed فَىْء until the night: (T, TA:) one says the ظِلّ of Paradise, but not its فَىْء, because the sun will never replace its ظِلّ; but En-Nábighah El-Jaadee has assigned to Paradise فَىْء having ظِلَال: (M, TA:) in a verse of Aboo-Sakhr ElHudhalee, ظِلٌّ is made fem. as meaning مَنِيَّة [i. e. <i>death</i>]: (Ham p. 161:) the pl.

                  </quote> [<i>As though thy face were a shade of a stone</i>] is said to mean hardness of face, and shamelessness: or the being black in the face: (T, TA:) for the Arabs say that there is nothing more dense in shade than a stone. (TA.) قَدْ ضَحَا ظِلُّهُ [<i>His shade,</i> or <i>shadow, has become sun</i>] is said of the dead. (TA.) مَرَّ بِنَا كَاَنَّهُ ظِلُّ ذِيْبٍ [<i>He passed by us as though he were the shadow of a wolf</i>] means swiftly, as does a wolf. (M.) اِنْتَعَلَتْ <br>\

And one says, هُوَ يَتْبَعُ ظِلَّ نَفْسِهِ (tropical:)  [<i>He follows the shadow of himself;</i> i. e. a thing that he will not overtake; for], as a poet says, the shadow that goes with thee thou wilt not overtake by following: and هُوَ يُبَارِى ظِلَّ نَفْسِهِ (tropical:)  [<i>He strives to outstrip the shadow of himself</i>], meaning that he walks with a proud and self-conceited gait: so in the A. (TA.) And اِنْتَقَلْتُ عَنْ ظِلِّى (tropical:)  <i>I left my state,</i> or <i>condition.</i> (TA.) And تَرَكَ الظَّبْىُ ظِلَّهُ: so in the T and S and O: (TA:) but [said to be] correctly, اَتْرُكُهُ تَرْكَ الظَّبْىِ ظِلَّهُ, (K,) or لَاَتْرُكَنَّهُ, (M, TA,) i. e. [<i>I will forsake him,</i> or <i>I will assuredly forsake him, as the gazelle forsakes</i>] <i>the place of its shade:</i> (O, TA:) [each, however, is app. right; and the former is the more agreeable with the following explanations:] a prov., (M,) applied to the man who is wont to take fright and flee; for the gazelle, when it takes fright and flees from a thing, never returns to it: (S, O, K:) by the ظِلّ is here meant the covert in which it shades and shelters itself in the vehemence of the heat; then the hunter comes to it and rouses it, and it will not return thither; and one says, تَرَكَ الظَّبْىُ ظِلَّهُ, meaning the place of its shade: it is applied to him who takes fright and flees from a thing, and forsakes it so as not to return to it; and to the case of a man&#39;s forsaking his companion. (Meyd.) [ثَقِيلُ الظِّلِّ as applied to a man, see expl. in art. ثقل: see also Har p. 250, where it is indicated that it may be rendered One <i>whose shadow,</i> even, <i>is oppressive,</i> and therefore much more so is his person.] In the phrase وَلَا اْلظِّلُّ وَلَا اْلْحَرُورُ, (M, K) in the Kur [xxxv. 20], Th says, accord. to some, (M,) الظِّلُّ means <i>Paradise;</i> (M, K;) and الحَرُورُ, the fire [of Hell]: but he adds, I say that الظِّلُّ is the ظِلّ itself [i. e. <i>shade</i>], and الحَرُورُ is the حَرّ itself [i. e. heat]: (M: [see also حَرُورٌ:]) and Er-Rághib says that ظِلٌّ is sometimes assigned to anything; whether it be approved, as in the phrase above mentioned; or disapproved, as in وَظِلٍّ مِنْ يَحْمُومٍ in the Kur [lvi. 42, meaning <i>And shade of smoke,</i> or <i>black smoke</i>]. (TA.) And الظِّلَالُ means ظِلَالُ الجَنَّةِ [<i>The shades of Paradise</i>]: (Fr, T, O, K, TA:) in some copies of the K, وَالظِّلَالُ <br>\

(TA.) الجَنَّةُ تَحْتَ ظِلَالِ السُّيُوفِ [<i>Paradise is beneath the shades of the swords</i>] is a trad., meaning that fighting against unbelievers is a way of attaining to Paradise. (Marg. note in a copy of the “ Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer.) مُلَاعِبُ ظِلِّهِ is an appellation of <i>A certain bird;</i> [see art. لعب;] and one says مُلَاعِبَا ظِلِّهِمَا; and مُلَاعِبَاتُ <br>\
                  ظِلِّهِنَّ: but when you make them indeterminate, you say مُلَاعِبَاتُ اَظْلَالِهِنَّ. (T, O, K. [But in the TA in art. لعب, it is said that one dualizes and pluralizes both nouns, because the appellation becomes determinate.]) ―         -b2-  ظِلُّ اللَّيْلِ means (tropical:)  <i>The blackness of the night:</i> (T, S, O, Msb;) metaphorically thus termed; (S;) as in the saying, اَتَانَا فِى ظِلِّ اللَّيْلِ [<i>He came to us in the blackness of the night</i>]: (S, O:) or it signifies جُنْحُ اللَّيْلِ [app. as meaning the <i>darkness,</i> and <i>confusedness, of the night;</i> see جُنْحٌ]; (M, TA;) or so الظِّلُّ: (K:) or this means <i>the night,</i> (M, K, TA,) <i>itself;</i> (M, TA;) so the astronomers say: (TA:) <i>all the night</i> is ظِلٌّ: and so is <i>all the period from the shining of the dawn to the rising of the sun.</i> (T.) ―         -b3-  ظِلُّ النَّهَارِ <br>\
                  <i>is The colour of the day when the sun predominates over it</i> [app. meaning <i>when the light of the sun predominates over that of the early dawn</i>]. (K.) ―         -b4-  ظِلُّ <br>\
                  السَّحَابِ means <i>Such, of the clouds, as conceal the sun:</i> or <i>the blackness of the clouds.</i> (M, K.) ―         -b5-  And ظِلَالُ البَحْرِ means <i>The waves of the sea;</i> (O, K, TA;) because they are raised so as to shade the ship and those that are in it. (TA.) ―         -b6-  ظِلٌّ also signifies <i>A</i> <br>\

(M. [See شُعْبَةٌ.]) And ظِلُّ الشَّىْءِ means (assumed tropical:)  <i>That which serves for the veiling, covering,</i> or <i>protecting, of the thing;</i> syn. كِنُّهُ. (M.) [Hence] one says, فُلَانٌ يَعِيشُ فِى ظِلِّ فُلَانٍ i. e.

                  خَاصَّة [or <i>special servant</i>].
