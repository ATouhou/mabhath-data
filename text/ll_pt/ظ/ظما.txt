                   a subst. from ظَمِيَ (S, M, K) in both of its senses; (M, K;) [i. e.] it signifies <i>Thirst:</i> (MA:) [or <i>most vehement thirst:</i> or the <i>slightest degree of thirst:</i>] pl. اَظْمَا=ءٌ. (MA.) ―         -b2-  [And (tropical:)  <i>Desire,</i> or <i>a longing,</i> (or, as we often say, <i>a thirsting,</i>) to meet with a person. See 1.] ―         -b3-  And (S, M, K) The <i>time,</i> or <i>interval,</i> or <i>period, between two drinkings,</i> or <i>waterings,</i> (T, S, M, K,) <i>in the coming of camels to water:</i> (T:) and the <i>keeping of camels from the water</i> [<i>during that interval,</i> i. e.] <i>until the extreme limit of the coming thereto:</i> (S:) pl. اَظْمَا=ءٌ. (T, S, M.) The shortest ظِمْءٌ of camels is that termed غِبٌّ, i. e., when they come to the water one day and return, and are in the place of pasture a day, and come to the water [again] on the third day; the interval between their two drinkings being termed a ظِمْء: this is during the greatest heat: but when Suheyl [i. e. Canopus] rises [aurorally, which it did in Central Arabia, about the commencement of the era of the Flight, on the 4th of August, O. S.], they increase the ظِمْء, so that the camels remain in the place of pasture two days, and come to the water on the fourth; and one says, وَرَدَتْ رِبْعًا: then follow the خِمْس and the سِدْس to the عِشْر: and the interval between their two drinkings is termed ظِمْءٌ, whether long or short. (T.) One says, مَا بَقِىَ مِنْ عُمُرِهِ اـِلَّا ظِمْءُ الحِمَارِ, (T, S, * K, * TA,) meaning <i>There remained not of his life save a little;</i> [lit., <i>save the period between the two drinkings of the ass;</i>] (S, K, * TA;) because there is no beast that bears thirst for a shorter time than the ass; (T, S, * K, * TA;) for he comes to the water in summer every day twice. (T, TA.) ―         -b4-  الظِّمْءُ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>The period from birth to death;</i> (K;) or so ظِمْءُ <br>\
