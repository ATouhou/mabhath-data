                  , inf. n. ظَنٌّ, (Msb,) [<i>He thought, opined, supposed,</i> or <i>conjectured:</i> and <i>he doubted:</i> and <i>he knew,</i> but <i>not by ocular perception:</i> see ظَنٌّ below:] you say, ظَنَنْتُ الشَّىْءَ, aor. اَظُنُّهُ, inf. n. ظَنٌّ; and ↓ <br>\
      اِظَّنَنْتُهُ and اِظْطَنَنْتُهُ; and ↓ <br>\
      تَظَنَّنْتُهُ and تَظَنَّيْتُهُ, this last formed by changing the last ن into ى: [i. e. <i>I thought the thing,</i> &amp;amp;c:] and Lh mentions, as heard from the Benoo-Suleym, ظَنْتُ ذَاكَ i. e. ظَنَنْتُ ذاك [<i>I thought that,</i> &amp;amp;c.] like ظَلْتُ and other instances of the dial. of Suleym. (M.) [In the first of the senses expl. above, it governs two objective complements, which are originally an inchoative and an enunciative:] you say, ظَنَنْتُكَ زَيْدًا [<i>I thought thee Zeyd,</i> originally <i>I thought thou wast Zeyd</i>], and ظَنَنْتُ زَيْدًا اـِيَّاكَ [<i>I thought Zeyd thee,</i> originally <i>I thought Zeyd was thou</i>], denoting by a pronoun what is originally an inchoative [in the former phrase] and what is originally an enunciative [in the latter phrase]. (S, TA.) It is also used [in this sense] in the same manner as a verb signifying an oath, the Arabs giving it the same kind of complement, saying, ظَنَنْتُ لَعَبْدُ <br>\
                  اْللّٰهِ خَيْرٌ مِنْكَ [<i>I thought surely &#39;Abd-Allah was better than thou</i>]. (S in art. درد.) [ظَنَّ بِهِ كَذَا means <i>I thought of him,</i> or <i>it, such a thing:</i> and <i>I thought such a thing to be in him,</i> or <i>it:</i> and is used in relation to good and to evil.] It is said in the Kur [xxxiii. 10], وَتَطُنُّونَ بِاْللّٰهِ اْلظُّنُونَا [<i>And ye were thinking, of God,</i> various <i>thoughts</i>]. (M.) Accord. to Sb, ظَنَنْتُ بِهِ means <i>I made him,</i> or <i>it, the place</i> [i. e. <i>object</i>] <i>of my</i> <br>\
                  ظَنّ [or <i>thought,</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (M.) [In all these exs. the verb denotes a state of mind between doubt and certainty, but the latter is predominant: and hence ظَنَّ sometimes means <i>He doubted:</i> and sometimes, <i>he knew, by considering with endeavour to understand, not by ocular perception;</i> being more frequently used in this sense than as meaning “ he doubted, ” though not so frequently as it is in the sense of “ he thought, ” whence the meaning “ he knew ” is held by some to be tropical.] اـِنَّى, ظَنَنْتُ اَنِّى مُلَاقٍ حِسَابِيَهْ, in the Kur [lxix. 20], means <i>Verily I knew</i> [<i>that I should meet with my reckoning</i>]. (T.) And اْلَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ اَنَّهُمْ مُلَاقُو <br>\
                  رَبِّهِمْ, in the same [ii. 43], means <i>Who know</i> [<i>that they shall meet their Lord,</i> lit., <i>be meeters of their Lord</i>]. (Msb.) And ظَنَنْتُ مَا قَالَ, occurring in a trad., means <i>I knew</i> [<i>what he meant to say</i> by his making a sign with his hand]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  ظَنَنْتُهُ, (M, Mgh, Msb,) aor. as above, (Msb,) and so the inf. n., (M,) signifies also <i>I suspected him; thought evil of him;</i> (M, Mgh, Msb;) and (M) so ↓ <br>\
      اِظَّنَنْتُهُ (S, M, Mgh, K) and اِظْطَنَنْتُهُ (M, TA) and اِطَّنَنْتُهُ. (TA.) [Thus, too, ↓ <br>\
      اَظْنَنْتُهُ accord. to several copies of the S and accord. to the CK; but this is app. a mistranscription.] In the saying of Ibn-Seereen, لَمْ <br>\

      يَكُنْ عَلِىٌّ يُظَّنُّ, (T, S, K, but in the T مَا كَان,) meaning <i>Alee was not suspected</i> [<i>in the case of the slaying of &#39;Othmán</i>], (T,) يُظَّنُّ is of the measure يُفْتَعَلُ, originally يُظْتَنُّ: (T, S, K:) so says A&#39;Obeyd: (T:) or, as some relate it, the word is يُطَّنُّ. (TA.) One says, بِكَذَا ↓ <br>\
      هُوَ يُظَّنُّ and يُطَّنُّ, meaning <i>He is suspected of such a thing.</i> (TA in art. طن.) And طَنَنْتُ بِزَيْدٍ and ظَنَنْتُ زَيْدًا <br>\
                  <i>I suspected Zeyd:</i> in  this sense the verb has a single objective complement. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  الظَّنّ [i. e. <i>thought,</i> &amp;amp;c.]; originally التَّظَنُّنُ. (S, K.) A&#39;Obeyd says, تَظَنَّيْتُ is from ظَنَنْتُ, and is originally تَظَنَّنْتُ; the ن being many, one of them is changed into ى: it is like قَصَّيْتُ, which is originally قَصَّصْتُ.

                   is a simple subst. as well as an inf. n.; (TA;) and signifies <i>Thought, opinion, supposition,</i> or <i>conjecture:</i> (Er-Rághib, Mgh, TA:) or <i>a preponderant belief, with the admission that the contrary may be the case:</i> (KT, El-Munáwee, TA:) or <i>a preponderating wavering between the two extremes in indecisive belief:</i> (K:) or <i>an inference from a sign,</i> or <i>mark,</i> or <i>token; when strong, leading to knowledge; and when weak, not exceeding the limit of</i> <br>\

      اُظْنُونَةٌ, but this I do not know. (M, TA.) One says, هُوَ سَيِّيُ الظَّنِّ بِكُلِّ اَحَدٍ [<i>He is evil in opinion of everyone</i>]. (M.) [And سَا=ءَ ظَنُّهُ بِفُلَانٍ <br>\
                  <i>His opinion of such a one was evil.</i>] And عِلْمُهُ <br>\

      ظَنَانَةٌ, (so accord. to a copy of the M,) or ↓ <br>\
      ظِنَانَةٌ, like كِتَابَةٌ, (TA,) signifies the same: (M, TA:) the pl. of ظِنَّةٌ is ظِنَنٌ. (S, K.)

                  اـِلَّا القَتْلَ فِى سَبِيلِ اْللّٰهِ is a saying mentioned, but not expl., by IAar; [app. meaning <i>Every death is doubtful as to its consequence except slaughter in the way,</i> or <i>cause, of God;</i> but ISd says,] in my opinion the meaning is that it <i>is of little good and profit.</i> (M.) دَيْنٌ ظَنُونٌ means <i>A debt of which one knows not whether he who owes it will pay it or not:</i> (A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, * K:) it is said in a trad. of &#39;Omar that there is no poorrate in the case of such a debt. (TA.) ―         -b4-  Also A man <i>suspected in relation to his intellect,</i> or <i>intelligence.</i> (Aboo-Tálib, TA.)

Thus in the saying in the Kur [lxxxi. 24], وَمَا هُوَ عَلَى اْلْغَيْبِ بِظَنِينٍ, (T, M, Msb,) meaning <i>And he is not suspected as to</i> what he makes known from God, of the knowledge of <i>that which is undiscoverable,</i> as is related on the authority of &#39;Alee: or, accord. to Fr, it may mean <i>weak;</i> for ظَنِينٌ may have this meaning like as ظَنُونٌ has: (T:) some read بِضَنينٍ. (TA in art. ضن, q. v.) شَهَادَةُ ظَنِينٍ, which is said in a trad. to be not allowable, is <i>The testimony of one who is suspected</i> as to his religion. (TA.) And نَفْسٌ ↓ <br>\
