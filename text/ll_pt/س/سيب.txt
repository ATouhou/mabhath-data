In the Kur v. 102, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  <i>A she-camel that was set at liberty to pasture where it would,</i> (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) <i>in the Time of Ignorance,</i> (S, K,) <i>on account of a vow</i> (S, Mgh, Msb, K) <i>and the like:</i> (S, K:) or the <i>mother of a</i> <br>\

(TA.) It is said in a trad., “ I saw &#39;Amr Ibn-Loheí dragging his intestines in the fire [of Hell]: ” and he was the first who set at liberty سَوَايِب: the doing of which is forbidden in the Kur v. 102. (TA.) And it is related that a hostile attack was made upon a certain man of the Arabs, and he found not any [other] beast to ride, so he rode a سَايِبَة: whereupon it was said to him, “ Dost thou ride what is forbidden? ” and he replied, يَرْكَبُ الحَرَامَ مَنْ لَا حَلَالَ لَهُ [He rides what is forbidden who has not what is allowed]: and this saying became a proverb. (M.) السَّايِبَتَانِ means <i>The</i> <br>\
                  بَدَنَتَانِ [i. e. <i>two camels,</i> or <i>cows</i> or <i>bulls, for sacrifice,</i>] <i>which the Prophet brought as offerings to the House</i> [<i>of God at Mekkeh</i>], <i>and which one of the believers in a plurality of gods took away:</i> they are thus called because he gave them up (سَيَّبَهُمَا) to God.

(S.) &#39;Omar said, السَّايِبَةُ وَالصَّدَقَةُ لِيَوْمِهِمَا [<i>The sáïbeh and alms are for their day</i>]: i. e., for the day of resurrection; so that one may not return to the deriving of any advantage from them in the present world.
