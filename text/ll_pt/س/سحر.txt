                  : see سَحْرٌ, first sentence.       -A2-  [Also] an inf. n. of سَحَرَهُ, meaning (tropical:)  The <i>turning</i> a thing <i>from its proper manner of being to another manner:</i> (T, TA: [accord. to the T, this seems to be proper; but accord. to the A, tropical:]) and hence, (T, TA,) (tropical:)  <i>enchantment,</i> or <i>fascination:</i> (T, * S, * MA, KL, PS:) for when. the enchanter (السَّاحِرُ) makes what is false to appear in the form of truth, and causes a thing to be imagined different from what it really is, it is as though he turned it from its proper manner of being: (T, TA:) the <i>producing what is false in the form of truth:</i> (IF, Msb:) or, in the common conventional language of the law, <i>any event of which the cause is hidden, and which is imagined to be different from what it really is:</i> and <i>embellishment by falsification, and deceit:</i> (Fakhred-Deen, Msb:) or <i>a performance in which one allies himself to the devil, and which is effected by his aid:</i> (TA:) <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  اَخْذَةٌ [meaning <i>a kind of enchantment,</i> or <i>fascination, which captivates the eye and the like, and by which enchantresses withhold their husbands from other women</i>]: (S:) and <i>anything of which the way of proceeding</i> or <i>operation</i> (مَاْخَذُهُ) <i>is subtile:</i> (S, K:) accord. to Ibn-Abee-&#39;Áïsheh, سِحْر is thus called by the Arabs because it changes health, or soundness, to disease: (Sh:) [and in like manner it is said to change hatred to love: (see 1:)] pl. اَسْحَارٌ and سُحُورٌ. (TA.) ―         -b2-  Also (tropical:)  <i>Skilful eloquence:</i> (TA:) or used absolutely, it is applied to that for which the agent is blamed: and when restricted, to that which is praiseworthy. (Msb.) Thus it is in the saying of Mohammad, اـِنَّ مِنَ البَيَانِ لَسِحْرًا <br>\
                   (tropical:)  [<i>Verily there is a kind of eloquence that is enchantment</i>]: because the speaker propounds an obscure matter, and discloses its true meaning by the beauty of his eloquence, inclining the hearts [of his hearers] in like manner as they are inclined by سِحْر: or because there is in eloquence a novelty and strangeness of composition which attracts the hearer and brings him to such a pass as almost diverts him from other things; therefore it is likened to سِحْر properly so called: and it is said to be السِّحْرُ الحَلَالُ [or <i>lawful enchantment</i>]. (Msb.) The saying of Mohammad mentioned above was uttered on the following occasion: Keys Ibn-&#39;Ásim El-Minkaree and EzZibrikán Ibn-Bedr and &#39;Amr Ibn-El-Ahtam came to the Prophet, who asked &#39;Amr respecting EzZibrikán; whereupon he spoke well of him: but Ez-Zibrikán was not content with this, and said, “ By God, O apostle of God, he knows that I am more excellent than he has said; but he envies the place that I have in thine estimation: ” and thereupon &#39;Amr spoke ill of him; and then said, “ By God, I did not lie of him in the first saying nor in the other; but he pleased me, and I spoke as pleased; then he angered me, and I spoke as angered: ” then Mohammad uttered the above-mentioned words. (TA.) Their meaning is, but God knows best, he praises the man, speaking truth respecting him, so as to turn the hearts of the hearers to him, (K,) or to what he says; (TA;) and he dispraises him, speaking truth respecting him, so as to turn their hearts also to him, (K,) or to what he says after. (TA.) A&#39; Obeyd says nearly the same. Or, as some say, the meaning is, that there is an eloquence that is sinful like سِحْر. (TA.) ―         -b3-  Also (tropical:)  <i>Skill; science:</i> Mohammad said, مَنْ تَعَلَّمَ بَابًا مِنَ النُّجُومِ فَقَدْ <br>\
                  تَعَلَّمَ بَابًا مِنَ السِّحْرِ (tropical:)  [<i>He who learneth a process of the science of the stars</i> (meaning <i>astrology</i> or <i>astronomy) learneth a process of enchantment</i>], which may mean that the science of the stars is forbidden to be learned, like the science of enchantment, and that the learning of it is an act of infidelity: or it may mean that it is <i>skill,</i> and <i>science;</i> referring to what is acquired thereof by way of calculation; as the knowledge of eclipses of the sun or moon, and the like. (ISd, TA.) ―         -b4-  Also (tropical:)  <i>Food; aliment; nutriment:</i> so called because its effect is subtile. (TA.) ―         -b5-  غَيْثٌ ذُو سِحْرٍ means (assumed tropical:)  <i>Superabundant rain.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

      سَحْرٌ (TA) and of ↓ <br>\
      سُحُرٌ, (Msb,) is اَسْحَارٌ: (Msb, K, TA:) the سَحَر is thus met. called because it is the time of the departure of the night and the coming of the day; so that it is the مُتَنَفَّس [lit. the “ time of the breathing, ” by which is meant the “ shining forth, ”] of the dawn: (A:) there are two times of which each is thus called; one, which is [specially] called السَّحَرُ الاَعْلَى, [or <i>the earlier</i> <br>\
                  سَحَر,] (A, Mgh,) is <i>before daybreak;</i> (Mgh;) or <i>a little before daybreak:</i> (A:) and the other, <i>at daybreak:</i> (A, Mgh:) like as one says “ the false dawn ” and “ the true: ” (A:) the earlier سَحَر is also called ↓ <br>\
      سُحْرَةٌ: (S, K:) or the سُحْرَة is the <i>same as the</i> <br>\
                  سَحَر: or it is the <i>last third of the night, to daybreak.</i> (TA.) Using سَحَر indeterminately, you make it perfectly decl., and say, اَتَيْتُهُ بِسَحَرٍ [<i>I came to him a little before daybreak</i>], agreeably with the phrase in the Kur liv. 34; (S;) and in like manner, ↓ <br>\
      بِسُحْرَةٍ [<i>in the earlier</i> <br>\
                  سَحَر]: (S, K:) you also say سَحَرًا, and ↓ <br>\

                  عِنْدَنَا مُنْذُ السَّحَرِ [<i>He ceased not to be with us,</i> or <i>at our abode, from a little before daybreak</i>]: and لَقِيتُهُ بِالسَّحَرِ الاَعْلَى, and بِاَعْلَى سَحَرَيْنِ, and بِاَعْلَى السَّحَرَيْنِ, (TA,) and فِى اَعْلَى السَّحَرَيْنِ, (A, TA,) [<i>I met him in the earlier</i> <br>\
                  سَحَر;] but بِاَعْلَى سَحَرٍ, a phrase used by El-&#39;Ajjáj, is erroneous: (TA:) and هٰذِهِ اللَّيْلَةِ ↓ <br>\
      لَقِيتُهُ سَحَرِىَّ and ↓ <br>\
      سَحَرِيَّتَهَا [<i>I met him in the time a little before daybreak of this</i> last <i>night</i>]. (TA.) When, by سَحَر alone, you mean the سَحَر of the night immediately preceding, you say, لَقِيتُهُ سَحَرَ يَا هٰذَا [<i>I met him a little before daybreak this last night, O thou</i> man], (S, K,) making it imperfectly decl. because it is altered from السَّحَرَ, (S,) or because it is for بِالسَّحَرِ; (TA;) and it is thus determinate by itself, (S, K,) without its being prefixed to another noun and without ال: (S:) and in the same sense you say بِسَحَرَ: (TA:) and you say, سِرْ عَلَى فَرَسِكَ سَحَرَ يَا فَتَى [<i>Go thou on thy horse a little before daybreak this night, O youth:</i> so in the TA; but in two copies of the S, for سِرْ I find سِيرَ]: you do not make it to terminate with damm, [like قَبْلُ and بَعْدُ &amp;amp;c.,] because it is an adv. n. which, in a place where it is fitting to be such, may not be used otherwise than as such: (S:) and [in like manner] you say, ↓ <br>\

                  سَحَر <br>\
                  <i>of this last night, O thou</i> man]. (TA.) If you make سَحَر the proper name of a man, it is perfectly decl.: and so is the dim.; for it is not of the measure of a noun made to deviate from its original from, like اُخَرُ: you say, ↓ <br>\
      سِرْ عَلَى فَرَسِكَ سُحَيْرًا [<i>Go thou on thy horse a very little before daybreak:</i> so in the TA; but here again, in two copies of the S, for سِرْ I find سِيرَ]: you do not make it to terminate with damm, [like قَبْلُ &amp;amp;c.,] because its being made of the dim. form does not bring it into the class of adv. ns. which may also be used as nouns absolutely, though it does bring it into the class of nouns which are perfectly declinable. (S, TA.) ―         -b2-  سَحَرٌ also signifies (tropical:)  <i>Whiteness overspreading blackness;</i> (K;) like صَحَرٌ; except that the former is mostly used in relation to the time so called, of daybreak; and the latter, in relation to colours, as when one says حِمَارٌ اَصْحَرُ; (TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      سُحْرَةٌ signifies the same; (TA;) <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
