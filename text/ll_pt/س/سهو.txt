                  غَفْلَة [or <i>unmindfulness</i> &amp;amp;c.] <i>of that which is within the scope of the retentive faculty, such as when one&#39;s attention is roused by the least rousing thereof;</i> whereas النسيان denotes its passing away from the memory entirely; though all are used in one sense by a careless reliance upon the understanding of the reader or hearer: in the Msb it is said that a distinction is made between السَّاهِى and النَّاسِى by the latter&#39;s being applied to him who, when he is reminded, remembers, and the former&#39;s being applied to him who is in the contrary case: accord. to IAth, سَهَافِى الشَّىْءِ means <i>he neglected,</i> or <i>omitted, the thing unknowingly;</i> and سَهَا عَنْهُ, <i>he neglected,</i> or <i>omitted, it knowingly:</i> or, as some say, السَّهْوُ is <i>the doing wrong from unmindfulness</i> (عَنْ غَفْلَة); as when an insane person reviles another, which is pardonable; and as when one drinks wine and then some unpleasing action proceeds from him unintentionally, which is punishable.
