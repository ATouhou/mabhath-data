(Msb. [See اَخْضَرُ: and see حَدِيقَةٌ دَهْمَا=ءُ and مُدْهَامَّةٌ, voce اَدْهَمُ.]) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] اَسْوَدُ القَلْبِ and سَوْدَا=وُهُ: see سَوَادٌ. ―         -b3-  [And السَّوْدَا=ءُ <br>\

      اَسْوَدَاتٌ: (M:) were it an epithet [used as such], its pl. would be سُودٌ: it is also called اَسْوَدُ سَالِحٌ, because it casts off its slough every year: you do not say اَسْوَدُ <br>\

      اَسْوَدَةٌ, (S, M,) which is extr.; (M;) and to this the epithet سَالِخَةٌ is not applied.

(Sh, TA.) ―         -b8-  And (tropical:)  <i>Dates and water;</i> (El-Ahmar, As, S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) both together being thus called by a term which properly applies to one only, [accord. to some,] for [they say that] الاَسْوَدُ alone signifies <i>dates,</i> not water, and especially, or mostly, <i>the dates of El-Medeeneh;</i> and in like manner, Aboo-Bekr and &#39;Omar together are called العُمَرَانِ; and the sun and the moon together, القَمَرَانِ: (TA:) or, as some say, it means <i>water and milk;</i> and is applied by a rájiz to <i>water and the herb called</i> <br>\
                  الفَثّ, of [the grain of] which bread is made, and is eaten [in time of dearth or drought]. (M, L.) See also سُوَيْدٌ. ―         -b9-  Also (assumed tropical:)  <i>The</i> <br>\

A party came as guests to Muzebbid El-Medenee, and he said to them, “ There is nothing for you with us but the اَسْوَدَانِ: ” and they replied, “ Verily therein is a sufficiency: dates and water: ” but he said, “ I meant not that: I only meant the حَرَّة and the night. ” (S, M.) And as to the saying of &#39;Áïsheh, that she was with the Prophet when they had no food, but only the اَسْوَدَانِ, which is expl. by the lexicologists as meaning dates and water, [and thus by Mtr in the Mgh, ISd says,] in my opinion she only meant the حَرَّة and night. (M.) ―         -b10-  هُوَ اَسْوَدُ الكَبِدِ [lit. <i>He is black-livered</i>] means (tropical:)  <i>he is an enemy:</i> (A, TA:) and سُودُ الاَكْبَادِ means (tropical:)  <i>enemies.</i> (M, A.) ―         -b11-  You say also, جَا=ءَ فُلَانٌ بِغَنَمِهِ سُودَ البُطُونِ, and, in like manner, حُمْرَ الكُلَى, both meaning (tropical:)  <i>Such a one brought his sheep,</i> or <i>goats, in a lean,</i> or <i>an emaciated, state.</i> (As, S, and A in art. حمر.) ―         -b12-  And رَمَى بِسَهْمِهِ الاَسْوَدِ (tropical:)  <i>He shot with his lucky arrow,</i> (A, K,) <i>that was smeared with blood,</i> (A,) <i>by means of which he looked for good fortune,</i> (K, TA,) because he had shot with it and hit the object shot at, (TA,) or as though it were black (K, TA) with blood, (TA,) or by its having been much handled. (K, TA.) ―         -b13-  And كَلَّمْتُهُ فَمَا رَدَّ عَلَىَّ سَوْدَا=ءَ وَلَا بَيْضَا=ءَ (tropical:)  <i>I spoke to him, and he did not return to me a bad word nor a good one:</i> (S, L:) or <i>a single word.</i> (A.) ―         -b14-  وَطْاَةٌ سَوْدَا=ءُ means (assumed tropical:)  <i>A footstep,</i> or <i>footprint, that is becoming effaced:</i> a recent one is termed حَمْرَا=ءُ. (S.) ―         -b15-  السَّوْدَا=ءُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Cultivated,</i> or <i>planted, land;</i> opposed to البَيْضَا=ءُ [q. v.]. (TA in art. بيض [See also سَوْدَةٌ.]) ―         -b16-  [But سَنَةٌ سَوْدَا=ءُ means (assumed tropical:)  <i>A very severe year; more severe than such as is termed</i> <br>\
