                  , inf. n. سَقَبٌ, <i>He,</i> or <i>it, was,</i> or <i>became, near.</i> (Msb.) سَقَبٌ is syn. with قُرْبٌ. (S, A, K.) You say, سَقِبَتْ دَارُهُ, (S, and so in the K accord. to the TA,) with kesr [to the ق], (S,) [inf. n. as above;] or سَقَبَت, (so in the CK and in my MS. copy of the K and in my copy of the Mgh,) inf. n. سَقْبٌ, (so in my copy of the Mgh,) or سُقُوبٌ; (K;) [but I believe the verb to be correctly سَقِبَت, like its syn. صَقِبَت, and the inf. n. to be correctly سَقَبٌ, and perhaps سُقُوبٌ also;] <i>His house was near;</i> (S, Mgh, K;) as also ↓ <br>\

                  الضْلَرژُّفْعَة [or <i>pre-emption</i>], when his house is contiguous: (Mgh:) IAth says that it is adduced as an evidence that الضْلَرژُّفْعَة belongs to the neighbour though not a sharer; i. e., that he has a better claim thereto than one who is not a neighbour: but some explain الجار as meaning <i>the partner,</i> or <i>sharer:</i> or the meaning of the trad. may be, the neighbour has a better, or the best, claim to kindness and assistance because of his being near.
