                  <i>He stretched himself:</i> (M:) <i>he lay upon his side, and stretched himself.</i> (S, K.) ―         -b2-  <i>He</i> (a slaughtered beast) <i>stretched himself to die.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  اسبطرّت الاـِبِلُ فِى سَيْرِهَا <br>\
                  <i>The camels hastened,</i> (M, * K, * TA,) <i>and stretched themselves, in their march,</i> or <i>course.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  اسبطرّت لَهُ <br>\
                  البِلَادُ <br>\
                  <i>The provinces became rightly disposed to him.</i> (Fr, K. *)    </entryFree> <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                   A lion <i>stretching himself when about to spring</i> or <i>leap.</i> (S, K.) ―         -b2-  A <i>quick</i> camel: pl. سِبَطْرَاتٌ: it has no broken pl. (Sb, M.) ―         -b3-  Also, the pl. above mentioned, Camels <i>long, upon the surface of the ground</i> [or <i>horizontally</i>]. (S, K.) The ت [says J] is not the denotative of the fem. gender: (S:) it is like that in رِجَالَاتٌ (S, K) and حَمَّامَاتٌ, as masc. pls.: (S:) but IB says, the ت in this word is the denotative of the fem. gender; for it is an epithet applied to جِمَالٌ, which is fem. as a [broken] pl.; as is shown by the saying الجِمَالُ سَارَتْ, and رَعَتْ, &amp;amp;c.: and he adds, J&#39;s saying that it is like رجالات and حمّامات <br>\
                   is a mistake, inasmuch as he confounds رجالات with حمّامات; for رِجَالٌ is a fem. pl., as is shown by one&#39;s saying الرِّجَالُ خَرَجَتْ, and سَارَتْ; but حَمَّامٌ is masc., and should not regularly have a pl. with ا and ت, but, as Sb says, it has this pl. form, like some other masc. words, in lieu of a broken pl., and would not have it if it had a broken pl. (TA.) ―         -b4-  Also the sing., <i>Penetrating; effective;</i> (Lth, M, K;) [as though <i>stretching far;</i>] <i>sharp in intellect; clever; acute:</i> (K: [in the CK, الماضِى السَّهْمِ is put by mistake for الماضى الشَّهْمُ:]) or <i>sharp in intellect, and very bold</i> or <i>daring</i> or <i>courageous.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  <i>Lank</i> hair. (M.) ―         -b6-  A man (Sh) <i>lank and tall.</i> (Sh, K.) ―         -b7-  And with ة, A <i>corpulent</i> woman. (M.)    </entryFree> <br>\
