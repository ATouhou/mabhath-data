      سِجْعٌ, but the former is that which commonly obtains, the latter being said to be a subst. like ذِبْحٌ meaning “ what is slaughtered, ” unknown, however, in the lexicons, and probably one of the instances of the elicitations of the foreigners, (MF, TA,) the object of him who says that it is سِجْعٌ being app. to make a distinction between the simple subst. and the inf. n., as in the case of the simple subst. and the inf. n. of سَجَعَ said of the pigeon; [see سَجَعَتِ الحَمَامَةُ;] (TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      اُسْجُوعَةٌ; (S, * K;) (tropical:)  <i>Rhyming speech</i> or <i>language;</i> (S, K, TA;) [i. e. <i>rhyming prose;</i> i. e.] <i>speech,</i> or <i>language, having</i> <br>\
                  فَوَاصِل <br>\
                  <i>like the rhymes of verse, without being measured;</i> so called as being likened to the سَجْع of the pigeon; (Msb;) or because of its uniformity, (TA,) and the mutual resemblance and agreement of the words which end its clauses: (IJ, TA:) or <i>a consecution</i> [<i>of clauses</i>] <i>of speech</i> or <i>language, with one</i> <br>\
                  رَوِىّ [which is the <i>principal, or only, rhyme-letter</i>]: (Jm, K:*) or <i>it consists in the agreement of the endings of words</i> [or <i>clauses</i>], <i>in a certain order, like the agreement of the rhymes</i> (قَوَافٍ) [<i>of verses</i>]: (Mbr, in the “ Kámil; ” TA:) <i>each clause ends with a quiescent letter; and consists of at least two words:</i> (Kull p. 208:) [see an ex. in the first paragraph of this art.:] you say also ↓ <br>\
      كَلَامٌ مُسَجَّعٌ (S) and ↓ <br>\
      كَلَامٌ مَسْجُوعٌ, meaning the same as سَجْعٌ: (TA:) the pl. of سَجْعٌ is اَسْجَاعٌ (S, K) and , accord. to IJ, سُجُوعٌ, but ISd says, I know not whether he have related this from another or coined it, (TA,) and اَسَاجِيعُ, (S,) or this last is pl. of ↓ <br>\
      اُسْجُوعَةٌ (K) [and is also a pl. pl., i. e. pl. of اَسْجَاعٌ, like as اَزَاهِيرُ is pl. of اَزْهَارٌ which is pl. of زَهْرٌ, and many similar instances might be added, such instances being numerous app. because اَفْعَالٌ is properly a measure of a pl. of paucity]. السَّجْعُ المُطَرَّفُ is <i>That</i> [<i>rhyming prose</i>] <i>in which the two words</i> [<i>that end two corresponding clauses</i>] <i>agree in the letter of the</i> <br>\
                  سَجْع <br>\

                  المُتَوَازِى is <i>that in which the measure is observed in the two words as well as the letter of the</i> <br>\
                  سَجْع; as القَلَمْ and القَسَمْ. (K T.) It is said in a trad., that Mohammad forbade سَجْع in prayer: [but many of the forms of prayer which he himself prescribed, and many others commonly used by Muslims in every age to the present time, are سَجْع, and the Kur-án is a composition of the same kind, though some do not allow this term to be applied to it, because سَجْع is <i>a highly artificial style of prose-language, characterized by a kind of rhythm as well as rhyme,</i> and it is obviously not proper to ascribe such artificial language to God, nor is it proper to use it in prayer, wherefore] Az says that سَجْع is disapproved in prayer because it resembles the language of the diviners, or soothsayers, but that other kinds of rhyming styles are allowable in خُطَب and رَسَايِل. (TA.) He is also related to have said, اـِيَّاكُمْ وَ سَجْعَ الكُهَّانِ (tropical:)  [<i>Avoid ye the rhyming prose of the diviners,</i> or <i>soothsayers</i>]. (TA.) One says also, ↓ <br>\
