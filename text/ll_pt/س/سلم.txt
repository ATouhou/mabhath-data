                  <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, free from fault, defect, imperfection, blemish,</i> or <i>vice;</i> syn. بَرِيَ. (Msb in art. برا.) [Hence,] one says, لَا بِذِى تَسْلَمُ مَا كَانَ <br>\
                  گَذَا وَكَذَا, (ISk, S, K, *) meaning <i>No, by God</i> [or <i>Him</i>] <i>who maketh thee to be in safety,</i> (ISk, S, K,) [<i>such and such things were not;</i>] and to two persons لا بذى تَسْلَمَانِ, and to a pl. number لا بذى تَسْلَمُونَ, and to a female لا بذى تَسْلَمِينَ, and to a pl. number [of females] لا بذى تَسْلَمْنَ. (ISk, S, K. *) And لَا اَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ بِذِى تَسْلَمُ, meaning, بِذِى سَلَامَتِكِ [i. e. <i>I will not do that, by the Author</i> (lit. <i>Lord</i> or <i>Master</i>) <i>of thy safety</i>]; and in like manner, بذى تَسْلَمَانِ, and بذى تَسْلَمُونَ.

(S, K.) ذى is thus prefixed to a verb [as virtually governing it in the gen. case] like as ا=يَة is in an instance mentioned under this latter word; but these are two extr. instances; for only a noun significant of time is [regularly] prefixed to a verb, as in the phrase هٰذَا يَوْمُ يُفْعَلُ, meaning يُفْعَلُ فِيهِ: (Akh, S:) it is not prefixed to any but this verb تَسْلَمُ [and its variations as above mentioned]. (Sb, M, K.) ―         -b2-  And hence, (Mgh,) one says also, سَلِمَتْ لَهُ الضَّيْعَةُ, meaning [<i>The landed estate</i>] <i>was,</i> or <i>became, free from participation to him;</i> syn. خَلَصَت.

                  سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكَ [q. v. infrà, voce سَلَامٌ]; syn. التَّحِيَّةُ. (TA.) You say, سَلَّمَ عَلَيْهِ [meaning <i>He so saluted,</i> or <i>greeted, him</i>]. (M, Msb.) [This, when said of God, virtually means سَلَّمَهُ, i. e. <i>He saved him;</i> and should be rendered agreeably with this explanation in the phrase commonly used after the mention of the Prophet, صَلَّى اْللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ <br>\

                  <i>Salutation to thee,</i> or <i>peace be on thee,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>O Prince of the Faithful.</i>] التَّسْلِيمَةُ signifies <i>The salutation that is pronounced on finishing every two rek&#39;ahs in prayer:</i> (Har p. 180:) [and also <i>that which is pronounced after the last rek&#39;ah of each of the prayers</i> (i. e. after the sunneh prayers and the fard alike), addressed to the two guardian and recording angels: (see my “ Modern Egyptians, ” ch. iii., p. 78 of the 5th ed.:) and سَلَّمَ means <i>He pronounced either of those salutations.</i>] ―         -b3-  [Hence also,] سلّم اـِلَيْهِ <br>\

      اسلم <br>\
                  الثَّوْبَ اـِلَى الخَيَّاطِ (Mgh) signifies the same as سلّمهُ اـِلَيْهِ [i. e. <i>He delivered the garment,</i> or <i>piece of cloth, to the tailor</i>]. (Har p. 166.) ―         -b4-  See also 4, in two places. ―         -b5-  You say also, سلّم <br>\

      اسلمهُ, both meaning the same, (S, Msb, K, TA,) i. e. <i>He committed his case to God.</i> (TA.) ―         -b7-  And سلّم الدَّعْوَى <br>\
                  <i>He acknowledged the truth</i> [or <i>justice</i>] <i>of the claim, demand,</i> or <i>suit;</i> [<i>he conceded its truth</i> or <i>justice;</i>] from سلّم الوَدِيعَةَ <br>\

                   see 2, in nine places. [The first of the meanings there assigned to this verb is, in my opinion, more than doubtful. In all its senses, it seems to be properly trans.: when it is used as an intrans. verb, an objective complement is app. understood. Thus,] اَسْلَمَ is syn. with اَسْلَفَ [as meaning <i>He paid in advance,</i> or <i>beforehand</i>]; (S, M, Mgh, Msb;) الثَّمَنَ [<i>the price</i>] being suppressed, though sometimes it is expressed; (Mgh;) as also ↓ <br>\
      سلّم; (M;) and ↓ <br>\
      تسلّم, as occurring in a trad., where it is said, مَنْ تَسَلَّمَ فِى شَىْءٍ فَلَا <br>\
                  يَصْرِفُهُ اـِلَى غَيْرِهِ [<i>Whoso pays in advance for a thing, he shall not turn it over,</i> or <i>transfer it, to another than him</i>]; but Kt says that he had not heard this verb thus used except in this instance. (TA.) So the first of these verbs signifies in the saying, اسلم فِى الطَّعَامِ (S) or فى البُرِّ (Mgh) [<i>He paid in advance for the wheat</i>], and فى <br>\
                  الشَّىْءِ [<i>for the thing</i>], as also ↓ <br>\
      سلّم. (M.) And hence the saying, اـِذَا اَسْلَمَ صُوفًا فِى لِبْدٍ اَوْ شَعَرًا فِى <br>\
                  مِسْحٍ لَمْ يَجُزْ [<i>If he give in advance wool for felt, or goats&#39; hair for a garment,</i> or <i>piece, of haircloth, it will not be allowable</i>]. (Mgh.) And so in the phrase, اَسْلَمْتُ اـِلَيْهِ [<i>I paid in advance to him</i>]. (Msb.) ―         -b2-  Also [<i>He resigned,</i> or <i>submitted, himself;</i> <br>\
                  نَفْسَهُ being understood: or] <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, resigned,</i> or <i>submissive;</i> (M, K;) and so ↓ <br>\
      استسلم: (S, M, Msb, K:) you say, اسلم <br>\
                  لِلّٰهِ [<i>He resigned,</i> or <i>submitted, himself,</i> or <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, resigned,</i> or <i>submissive, to God:</i> see also an ex. (before referred to) in the last sentence of the second paragraph: or <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, sincere in his religion,</i> or <i>without hypocrisy, towards God:</i> see مُسْلِمٌ]: (Msb:) [or] اسلم signifies <i>he entered into</i> <br>\
                  السِّلْم, (S, Msb,) which here means الاِسْتِسْلَام [i. e. <i>the state of resignation,</i> or <i>submission</i>]. (S.) ―         -b3-  And <i>He became a Muslim;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      تسلّم; (M, * K;) as in the saying, كَانَ كَافِرًا ثُمَّ تَسَلَّمَ, i. e. اَسْلَمَ [<i>He was an unbeliever,</i> or <i>a denier of the unity of God,</i> &amp;amp;c.; <i>then he became a Muslim</i>]: (M:) or <i>he entered</i> [<i>the pale,</i> or <i>communion, of</i>] <i>the religion of</i> <br>\
                  الاـِسْلَام. (S, * Msb.) الاـِسْلَامُ as a principle of the law of God is <i>The manifesting of humility</i> or <i>submission, and outward conforming with the law of God, and the taking upon oneself to do or to say as the Prophet has done or said:</i> for this, the blood is to be spared, and one may demand the repelling of evil: (T, * M:) and if there is therewith firm belief with the heart, it is اـِيمَانٌ: (T:) this is the doctrine of Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee; but the doctrine of Aboo-Haneefeh makes no difference between these two terms: (KT:) [agreeably with the former doctrine,] Th well and briefly says, الاسلام is with the tongue, and الايمان is with the heart: and he says, in explaining verse 48 of ch. v. of the Kur, that every prophet has been sent with الاسلام, though the ordinances differ. (M.) ―         -b4-  One says also, اَسْلَمْتُ <br>\
                  عَنْهُ, meaning <i>I left it</i> [app. an affair, as in an explanation in the TK,] <i>after I had been</i> [<i>engaged</i>] <i>in it.</i> (Ibn-Buzurj, K.) And اسلم occurs intransitively in the saying, كَانَ رَاعِىَ غَنَمٍ ثُمَّ <br>\
                  اَسْلَمَ, meaning [<i>He was a pastor of sheep,</i> or <i>goats; then</i>] <i>he left them.</i> (M.) ―         -b5-  [Freytag assigns to اسلم another signification “ <i>Adscendere fecit</i> (vid. a سُلَّم), ” as from the Ham, p. 39: but this is app. a mistake, into which he has been led by a saying, there cited, of Zuheyr, which I read thus: <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

(TA.) سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ is an announcement of the continuance of سَلَامَة [or safety, &amp;amp;c.]: (Bd in xiii. 24:) [it may therefore be rendered <i>Safety,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>be,</i> or <i>light and abide, on you;</i> or, generally, <i>peace be,</i> or <i>light and abide, on you;</i> for] it means <i>nothing disliked,</i> or <i>evil, shall befall you henceforth:</i> (Bd in xvi. 34:) and سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكَ [may be rendered in like manner; for it virtually] means <i>I will not do to thee anything that is disliked,</i> or <i>evil;</i> (Bd and Jel in xix. 48;) <i>nor say to thee henceforward what would annoy thee,</i> or <i>be disagreeable,</i> or <i>evil, to thee.</i> (Bd ibid.) It may also be [rendered <i>May safety,</i> &amp;amp;c., or <i>peace, be,</i> or <i>light and abide, on you;</i> as] a prayer for سَلَامَة, to those to whom it is addressed, from the state in which they are at the time. (Bd in xxviii. 55.) [It is generally held that this salutation may not be used by, nor to, any but a Muslim.] In the beginning of an epistle, the approved practice is to write سَلَامٌ <br>\
                  عَلَيْكَ, without the article ال; and in repeating it, at the end, to write it with that article. (Durrat el-Ghowwás, in De Sacy&#39;s Anthol. Gramm. Arabe, p. 72 of the Arabic text. [In the latter case, the general practice in the present day is to write simply وَالسَّلَام, suppressing عَلَيْكَ.]) In saluting the dead, one puts عَلَيْكَ first, saying, عَلَيْكَ سَلَامُ اْللّٰهِ.

      سَالِمٌ, which latter applies only to him who is liable to evil of any kind, and who expects it, and then becomes safe, or free, from it. (TA.) دَارُ السَّلَامِ is an appellation of <i>Paradise,</i> (M, K,) [applied thereto in the Kur vi. 127 and x. 26,] as being <i>the abode of everlasting safety,</i> or <i>security;</i> (Zj, M, TA;) <i>the abode of safety,</i> or <i>security, from evils of any kind, from death and decrepitude and diseases</i> [<i>&amp;amp;c.</i>]: (TA:) or as being <i>the abode of God.</i> (M, TA.) ―         -b2-  See also سِلْمٌ, in four places. ―         -b3-  [As is there stated,] it signifies also <i>Salutation,</i> or <i>greeting;</i> (M, TA;) particularly the <i>salutation of</i> <br>\

                  سَلَامًا], this last word signifies تَسَلُّمًا, (Sb, M,) or تَسَلُّمًا مِنْكُمْ [for نَتَسَلَّمُ مِنْكُمْ تَسَلُّمًا <br>\

Sb asserts that Aboo-Rabee&#39;ah used to say, اـِذَا لَقِيتَ <br>\
                  فُلَانًا فَقُلْ سَلَامًا, meaning تَسَلُّمًا [for اَتَسَلَّمُ مِنْكَ <br>\
                  تَسَلُّمًا, i. e. <i>When thou meetest such a one, say, I declare myself to be clear,</i> or <i>quit, of thee</i>]: and he says that some of them said سَلَامٌ, meaning <i>The case of me and thee is the</i> [<i>case of</i>] <i>being clear,</i> or <i>quit, each of the other;</i> and <i>the</i> [<i>case of</i>] <i>mutual relinquishing.</i> (M.)
