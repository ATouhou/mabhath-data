                  اَسْرَعَ [which may mean as above, or <i>he hastened, made haste,</i> or <i>sped,</i>] in his speech and in his actions: (IAar, TA:) but Sb makes a difference between سَرُعَ and اَسْرَعَ: see the latter below: (TA:) one says also سَرِعَ, aor.      <br>\

      تسرّع, said of an affair, or event, signifies the same as سَرُعَ. (TA.) One says, السِّرَعَ السِّرَعَ like الوَحَا=ءَ <br>\
                  الوَحَا=ءَ, (S, K,) i. e. [Make thou] <i>haste;</i> or <i>haste to be first,</i> or <i>before,</i> or <i>beforehand: haste;</i> or <i>haste to be first,</i> &amp;amp;c. (S and TA in art. وحى.) And سَرُعَ مَا فَعَلْتَ ذَاكَ, (S, * TA,) and سَرْعَ, which is a contraction of the former; for the Arabs contract by the suppression of dammeh and kesreh because they are difficult of pronunciation, saying فَخْذٌ for فَخِذٌ and عَضْدٌ for عَضْدٌ, but one should not say حَجْرٌ for حَجَرٌ, (S, TA,) or the like, accord. to the Basrees, though the Koofees allow the contraction in the case of fet-hah also, as in سَلْفَ for سَلَفَ; (M in art. سلف;) and one says also سُرْعَ, as a contraction of سَرُعَ; all meaning سَرْعَانَ [i. e. <i>Quick was thy doing that:</i> or <i>how quick was thy doing that!</i> or, which is nearly the same, <i>excellently quick was thy doing that;</i> for سَرُعَ is similar to قَضُوَ and رَمُوَ, denoting excellence].

      اـِسْرَاعٌ is syn. (TA.) One says, سَارَعُوا <br>\

      تسارعوا, [<i>They hastened, one with another,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>to such a thing,</i>] both signifying the same. (S.) And [of a single person,] سارع اـِلَى الشَّىْءِ <br>\
                  <i>He hastened to the thing;</i> syn. بادر. (Msb.) And it is said in the Kur [iii. 127], وَسَارِعُوا اـِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ [<i>And vie ye, one with another, in hastening to</i> obtain <i>forgiveness from your Lord</i>]. (TA.)

<b>اسرع</b>               1     <br>\
                     اسرع<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                   is originally trans.; (S, K;) [signifying <i>He quickened,</i> or <i>hastened,</i> himself, or his going, &amp;amp;c.;] and hence the saying, in a trad., اـِذَا مَرَّ <br>\
                  اَحَدُكُمْ بِطِرْبَالٍ مَايِلٍ فَلْيُسْرِعِ المَشْىَ [<i>When any one of you passes by a high wall,</i> or <i>the like,</i> that is <i>inclining, let him quicken,</i> or <i>hasten, the pace,</i> or <i>going</i>]. (K, * TA.) But [it is used also elliptically, as meaning <i>He hastened, in an intrans. sense; he made haste; he sped; he went quickly;</i> and hence] you say, اسرع فِى السَّيْرِ, (S, K,) like سَرُعَ [<i>He was quick, expeditious, hasty, speedy, rapid, swift,</i> or <i>fleet, in going, journeying,</i> or <i>pace</i>]: (K:) or [rather <i>he hastened, made haste,</i> or <i>sped, therein;</i> for] اسرع signifies <i>he endeavoured,</i> or <i>sought,</i> and <i>affected, to be quick,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>as though he hastened the pace,</i> or <i>going;</i> but ↓ <br>\
      سَرُعَ denotes what is as it were an innate quality: (Sb:) the verb being originally trans., when you say of one اسرع فى السير it is as though [meaning] <i>he urged himself forward with haste;</i> or <i>he quickened,</i> or <i>hastened, the pace,</i> or <i>going;</i> and it is only because the meaning is understood by the persons addressing one another, that the objective complement is not expressed: (Lth, K:) or the verb may be trans. by means of a particle and without a particle: or when made immediately trans., the phrase may be meant to be understood as elliptical. (TA.) [Accord. to Fei,] اسرع فِى <br>\
                  مَشْيِهِ, &amp;amp;c., inf. n. اـِسْرَاعٌ, is originally اسرع مَشْيَهُ [<i>He quickened,</i> or <i>hastened, his pace,</i> or <i>going</i>]; فى being redundant; or اسرع الحَرَكَةَ فِى مَشْيِهِ [<i>he quickened,</i> or <i>hastened, the motion in his going</i>]: and اسرع اـِلَيْهِ means اسرع المُضِىَّ اـِلَيْهِ [<i>he quickened,</i> or <i>hastened, the going to him</i>]. (Msb.) ↓ <br>\
      سرّع is syn. with اسرع. (TA.) And you say, اـِلَى الشَّرِّ ↓ <br>\
      تسرّع, (S, K,) meaning <i>He hastened,</i> or <i>made haste, to</i> [do] <i>evil,</i> or <i>mischief;</i> (K;) as also تزرّع. (Sgh and K in art. زرع.) And ↓ <br>\
      تسرّع <br>\
                  بِالاَمْرِ <br>\
                  <i>He hastened to do the thing,</i> or <i>affair;</i> syn. بَادَرَ بِهِ. (TA.) See also 3. ―         -b2-  اسرع اـِلَيْهِ occurs in a trad. as meaning <i>He was quick,</i> or <i>hasty, in being angry with him,</i> or <i>in blaming him,</i> or <i>in reviling him.</i> (Mgh.) ―         -b3-  اسرع بِهِ: see [its contr.] بَطَّاَ بِهِ. ―         -b4-  اَسْرَعُوا signifies also, <i>Their beasts on which they rode were,</i> or <i>became, quick, swift,</i> or <i>fleet.</i> (AZ, S, K.)       -A2-  مَا اَسْرَعَ مَا صَنَعْتَ <br>\

                  <i>Quickness, expedition, haste, speed, rapidity, swiftness,</i> or <i>fleetness;</i> [of course, tendency, action, speech, &amp;amp;c.;] (S, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      سَرَعٌ; (K;) [the former said in the K, and the latter in the TA, to be an inf. n. of سَرُعَ:] and <i>a hastening, making haste,</i> or <i>speeding; i. q.</i> <br>\
                  اـِسْرَاعٌ [inf. n. of 4]; (TA;) or a subst. therefrom. (Msb.) You say, عَجِبْتُ مِنْ سُرْعَةِ ذَاكَ [<i>I wondered at the quickness,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>of that</i>]. (S.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>سَرْعَانَ</b>               1     <br>\

                   and سُرْعَانَ and سِرْعَانَ (S, K) and ↓ <br>\
      سَرُعَانَ, the last with damm to the ر (IAar,) occurring in the phrase سرعانَ ذَا خُرُوجًا, (IAar, S, K,) meaning سَرُعَ ذَا خُرُوجًا [<i>Quick is this in coming forth:</i> or <i>how quick is this in coming forth!</i> or, which is nearly the same, <i>excellently quick</i> &amp;amp;c.], (S, K,) are dial. vars., changed from the original form, which is سَرُعَ, and, for this reason, (S,) made indecl., with the final vowel of سَرُعَ for their termination. (S, K.) The word سرعان is used as a simple enunciative [placed before its inchoative], and also as an enunciative denoting wonder: [see بُطْا=نَ:] and hence the saying, (K,) لَسَرْعَانَ مَا <br>\
                  صَنَعْتَ كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>How quick was thy doing that!</i> (S, K.) The saying سَرَعَانَ ذَا اـِهَالَةٌ originated from the fact that a man had a lean ewe, her snivel running from her nostrils by reason of her leanness, and it being said to him “ What is this? ” he answered, “ Her grease: ” whereupon the asker said as above: the last word is in the accus. case as a denotative of state; and the meaning is, <i>Quick,</i> or <i>how quick, is this</i> snivel [coming forth] <i>in the state of melted grease!</i> or the last word is a specificative, under the supposition that the action is transferred [from its proper agent, which thus becomes a specificative], as in the phrase تَصَبَّبَ زَيْدٌ عَرَقًا; and the meaning to be understood is, <i>Quick,</i> or <i>how quick, is the melted grease of this!</i> the saying is applied to him who tells of a thing&#39;s coming to pass before its time: (O, K:) it is a prov.

(TA.) سَرَعَانُ الخَيْلِ, also, signifies <i>The first</i> or <i>foremost, of the horsemen,</i> and sometimes they said الخيل ↓ <br>\
      سَرْعَانُ. (K.) Abu-l-&#39;Abbás says that when سرعان is an epithet applied to men, it has both of the above-mentioned forms; but when applied to others, the former is the more chaste, though the latter is allowable. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
