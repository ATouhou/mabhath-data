                     ذ<br>\
                   The <i>departure of reason,</i> or <i>intellect:</i> its verb [which was probably سُهِّبَ, like اُسْهِبَ, q. v.,] is obsolete. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>He went far,</i> or <i>to a great</i> or <i>an extraordinary length,</i> in a thing; for instance, in journeying; as in a trad., in which it is said of horses, or horsemen, اَسْبَهَتْ شَهْرًا <br>\
                  <i>They went far for a month;</i> and in eating and drinking; as in another trad.: (TA:) it is from سُهْبٌ, signifying “ a plain and far-extending land; ” as though meaning <i>He traversed a plain and far-extending tract of land;</i> like as one says اَسْهَلَ and اَحْزَنَ. (Har p. 572.) <i>He</i> (a horse) <i>ran with wide steps, and preceded,</i> or <i>outstripped.</i> (S, TA. [See also سَهْبٌ, below.]) And [hence,] <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, loquacious,</i> or <i>profuse of speech;</i> (IAar, S, K;) like اسهم; (K * and TA in art. سهم;) [and] so اسهب فِى المَنْطِقِ : (JK:) or <i>he doted;</i> or <i>was disordered in his intellect;</i> but when a man makes many mistakes in his speech, you say of him اَفْنَدَ: (As, TA:) or <i>he doted much,</i> or <i>often;</i> or <i>was much,</i> or <i>often, disordered in his intellect:</i> (AO, TA:) [and it seems from an explanation of the part. n. مُسْهِبٌ that it probably signifies also <i>he was eloquent,</i> or <i>profuse of correct speech:</i>] or <i>he was very greedy, and</i> (in some copies of the K “ or ”) <i>covetous, so as to refrain from nothing:</i> (K, TA:) and you say also اسهب كَلَامَهُ <br>\
                  <i>He prolonged,</i> or <i>was prolix in, his speech:</i> and فى كَلَامِهِ اـِسْهَابٌ <br>\
                  <i>In his speech is prolixity.</i> (A, TA.) Also <i>He</i> (a man) <i>gave much,</i> or <i>largely;</i> and so ↓ <br>\
      استهب: (Lth, K:) [or, in this sense,] you say, اسهب فِى العَطَا=ء. (A.) ―         -b2-  اسهبوا <br>\
                  <i>They reached sand,</i> in digging [a well], <i>and water came not forth:</i> (S:) or <i>they dug, and came upon sand</i> or <i>a current of air:</i> (K:) or <i>they dug, and came upon a current of air, and the water disappointed them of its coming:</i> (Az, TA:) or <i>they dug without attaining any good:</i> (K:) or اسهب signifies <i>he dug until he reached sand:</i> and, accord. to Th, <i>he dug a well and reached water.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  اسهبوا الدَّابَّةَ <br>\
                  <i>They left the beast alone, or by itself,</i> (K, TA,) <i>to pasture</i> [<i>where it would</i>]. (TA.)       -A2-  اسهب الشَّاةَ <br>\

                  <i>Her young one sucked,</i> (K,) or <i>licked,</i> (TA,) <i>the ewe,</i> or <i>she-goat.</i> (K.)       -A3-  اُسْهِبَ <br>\
                  <i>He</i> (a man, S) <i>lost his reason,</i> (S, K, TA,) as some say, (TA,) <i>from the bite of a serpent,</i> (S, K, TA,) or <i>the sting of a scorpion:</i> (TA:) or <i>his colour became altered in consequence of love</i> or <i>fright</i> or <i>disease:</i> (K:) or, accord. to AHát, اسهب, [so in the TA, in which it seems to be implied that اَسْهَبَ, not اُسْهِبَ, is meant,] inf. n. اـِسْهَابٌ, signifies <i>he</i> (a man bitten by a serpent, or stung by a scorpion,) <i>lost his reason and lived.</i> (TA. [See also the part. n., مُسْهَبٌ, below.]) اـِسْهَابُ اللُّبِّ [in which the former word is probably the inf. n. of اُسْهِبَ, not of اَسْهَبَ,] means <i>The mind&#39;s being confounded,</i> or <i>perplexed, by</i> [<i>love of</i>] <i>a woman.</i> (JK.)    </entryFree> <br>\
