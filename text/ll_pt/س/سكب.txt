<b>سَكْبٌ</b>               1     <br>\

      سَيْكَبٌ (K) and ↓ <br>\
      سَكِيبٌ (CK [omitted in the TA and in my MS. copy of the K]) and ↓ <br>\
      اُسْكُوبٌ (K) Water <i>poured out</i> or <i>forth,</i> or <i>being poured out</i> or <i>forth:</i> or <i>poured out</i> or <i>forth,</i> (K, TA,) <i>running upon the surface of the earth without any excavation:</i> (TA:) or the first signifies water <i>poured out</i> or <i>forth;</i> and is an inf. n. used as an epithet, like صَبٌّ and غَوْرٌ applied as epithets to water: and ↓ <br>\
      سَكُوبٌ, water <i>running upon the surface of the earth without any excavation:</i> and ↓ <br>\
      اُسْكُوبٌ, water <i>pouring out</i> or <i>forth,</i> or <i>being poured out</i> or <i>forth;</i> (S;) or, as some say, <i>pouring much:</i> (Har pp. 469 et seq.:) and also this last, <i>running</i> water: (TA:) or this signifies دَايِمُ الهَطَلَانِ [i. e. <i>continually pouring,</i> or <i>continually pouring dispersedly and in large drops;</i> as also سَكْبٌ; for hence it appears evident that الهَطَلَانُ الدَّايِمُ as an explanation of السَّكْبُ and الاُسْكُوبُ in the K is a mistake for الدَّايِمُ الهَطَلَانِ]; and is applied as an epithet to water and to blood; (A;) and also [probably in this sense] to clouds (سَحَابٌ); and to a wound made with a spear or the like (طَعْنَةٌ): and ↓سَاكِبٌ is applied as an epithet to tears (دَمْعٌ). (TA.) ―         -b2-  [Hence] سَكْبٌ applied to a horse means (tropical:)  <i>Wide in step:</i> (S, A, K:) or <i>fleet,</i> or <i>swift,</i> or <i>excellent in running;</i> (A, K;) <i>that runs much:</i> (Mgh, TA:) or <i>light,</i> or <i>active:</i> and ↓ <br>\
      اُسْكُوبٌ, so applied, has one or another of these meanings: (A:) or the former, thus applied, <i>that runs vehemently;</i> as also فَيْضٌ; likened to water pouring forth: (EthThaalebee, TA:) also, (K, TA,) applied to a horse and a man and a boy, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  <i>light of spirit;</i> and <i>brisk, lively,</i> or <i>sprightly,</i> (K, TA,) <i>in work,</i> or <i>action.</i> (TA.) السَّكْبُ was the name of the first horse possessed by the Prophet; (Mgh, * K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      السَّكَبُ: and the name of a horse of Shebeeb Ibn-Mo&#39;áwiyeh. (K.) ―         -b3-  [Hence also,] (assumed tropical:)  <i>A certain sort of clothes,</i> or <i>garments,</i> (T, S, K,) <i>thin so as to resemble dust, and as though resembling pouring water by reason of its thinness;</i> and so, accord. to IAar, ↓سَكَبٌ. (T, TA.) ―         -b4-  Applied to a man, (assumed tropical:)  <i>Tall;</i> (K;) a dial. var. of سَقْبٌ [q. v.]. (TA.) ―         -b5-  And (tropical:)  A <i>necessary</i> thing or affair: (A, K, TA:) and (tropical:)  a disgrace (سُبَّةٌ) that is <i>necessary,</i> or <i>unavoidable.</i> (A, TA.) Lakeet Ibn-Zurárah said to his brother Maabad, when he required him to ransom him with two hundred camels, he being a captive, نُمِيطُ عَنْكَ شَيْيًا يَكُونُ عَلَى اَهْلِ بَيْتِكَ سُبَّةً سَكْبًا, meaning (tropical:)  [<i>We will put away from thee a thing that would be to the people of thy house</i>] <i>a necessary,</i> or <i>an unavoidable, disgrace.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  Also <i>Copper,</i> or <i>brass;</i> syn. نُحَاسٌ: or <i>lead:</i> (IAar, K:) and so ↓ <br>\
