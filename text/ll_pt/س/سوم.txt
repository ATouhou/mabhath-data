It is related in a trad., respecting the salutation of the Jews, that they used to say, السَّامُ عَلَيْكُمْ [<i>Death</i> come <i>upon you,</i> instead of السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ]; and that he [i. e. Mo- hammad] used to reply, عَلَيْكُمْ; accord. to the generality of the relaters, وَعَلَيْكُمْ, but correctly without the و, because the و implies participation: and it is related of &#39;Áïsheh that she used to say to them, عَلَيْكُمُ السَّاْمُ وَالذَّاْمُ وَاللَّعْنَةُ, as mentioned in art. سام: (TA:) the Jews are also related to have said [to the Muslims], عَلَيْكُمُ السَّامُ الدَّامُ meaning المَوْتُ الدَّايِمُ.
