      اِسَّاقَطَ [originally تَسَاقَطَ] signifies the same; (K;) as in the phrase in the Kur [xix. 25], تَسَّاقَطْ عَلَيْكِ رُطَبًا جَنِيًّا, or يَسَّاقَطْ, accord. to different readings, <i>It,</i> namely the palm-tree (نَخْلَة) accord. to the former reading, and the trunk (جِذْع) accord. to the latter reading, <i>shall drop upon thee with fresh ripe dates, plucked;</i> <br>\
                  رطبا جنيّا being transferred from its proper place, and used as a specificative; the meaning being, يَسَّاقَطْ رُطَبُ الجِذْعِ: so says Fr. (Az, TA.) [This phrase of the Kur, with the above-mentioned explanation, but less fully given, occurs in a copy of the S which, throughout this art., differs much from other copies.] You say also, سَقَطَ فُلَانٌ مَغْضْلَرژِيًّا عَلَيْهِ [<i>Such a one fell down in a swoon</i>].

And it is said in a postclassical prov., حَيْثُمَا سَقَطَ لَقَطَ [<i>Wherever he alights he picks up</i> something]: applied to him who practises evasions, shifts, artifices, or the like.
