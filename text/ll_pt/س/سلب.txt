      استلبتهُ, but another instance of the former of these two verbs, in a similar sense, occurs in what follows]: originally, سَلَبْتُ ثَوْبَ زيَدٍْ [<i>I took away the garment of Zeyd</i>]; but the verb has been made to have زيد for its object, and the ثوب is postponed, and put in the accus. case as a specificative [though by rule the specificative should be indeterminate]; and it may be suppressed, [so that you may say simply, سَلَبْتُهُ, meaning <i>I took away from him what was upon him</i> or <i>with him, spoiled him,</i> or <i>plundered him,</i>] the meaning being understood.
