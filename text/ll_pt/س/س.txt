                  <i>The twelfth letter of the alphabet;</i> called سِينٌ. It is one of the letters termed مَهْمُوسَة [or non-vocal, i. e. pronounced with the breath only, without the voice]; and of the letters termed اَسَلِيَّة, as also ص and ز, because proceeding from the tip of the tongue: its place of utterance is between that of ص and that of ز: and Az says hat it is never conjoined with either of these two letters in any Arabic word: (TA:) it is a sibilant letter; and is distinguished from ص by the raising of the tongue to the palate [in the utterance of the latter], and from ز by the suppression of the voice [in the utterance of the former]. (K in art. سين.) It is one of the letters of augmentation [occurring in the form اِسْتَفْعَلَ and its derivatives]. (S and L in art. سين.) [See also سِينٌ in art. سين. It is sometimes substituted for ص; as in سَقْرٌ, for صَقْرٌ: and for ش, as in سِطْرَنْجٌ, for شِطْرَنْجٌ: (see De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed., ii. 230-233: and iii. 530-532:)] and AZ says that some of the Arabs substitute for it ت, (S and L and K * in art. سين,) as in the saying (S and L in art. سين) of &#39;Alyà Ibn-Arkam, (L ib.,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>O, may God remove far from good,</i> or <i>from prosperity, the sons of the Sialáh, &#39;Amr Ibn-Yarbooa, the worst of mankind: they are not chaste, nor sharp in intellect</i>]: he means النَّاسِ and بِاَكْيَاسِ: (S and L ib.:) and in like manner one says طَسْتٌ for طَسٌّ. (TA in art. كيت.) ―         -b2-  يٰس= in the Kur [commencing ch. xxxvi.] is like ا=ل=م= and حٰم= at the commencement of chapters of the same; and is said by &#39;Ikrimeh to mean يَا اـِنْسَانُ [<i>O man</i>]; because it is followed by the words اـِنَّكَ لَمِنَ المُرْسَلِينَ: (S and L in art. سين:) or it means either thus, or يَا سَيِّدُ [<i>O man of dignity</i>]. (K in art. سين.)       -A2-  سَ is a particle peculiarly prefixed to the aor., rendering it clearly denotative of the future, (Mughnee, and S * and L * in art. سين,) as in سَيَفْعَلُ [<i>He will do</i> such a thing], (S and L ib.,) and considered as forming a part thereof, for which reason it does not exercise any government upon it: it is not contracted from سَوْفَ, contrary to what the Koofees hold: nor is the extent of the future with it shorter than it is with سَوْفَ, contrary to what the Basrees hold: the analytical grammarians term it حَرْفُ تَنْفِيسٍ, by which is meant a particle of amplification; because it changes the aor. from the strait time, which is the present, to the ample time, which is the future: but plainer that their expression is the saying of Z and others, [that it is] a particle denoting the future. (Mughnee.) Kh asserts that it corresponds [as an affirmative] to [the negative] لَنْ. (S and L in art. سين.) Some assert that it sometimes denotes continuance, not futurity: this is mentioned in relation to the saying in the Kur [iv. 93], سَتَجِدُونَ ا=خَرِينَ [as though meaning <i>Ye continually find others</i>]; and they adduce as an evidence thereof the saying in the same [ii. 136], سَيَقُولُ اْلسَّفَهَا=ءُ مِنَ اْلنَّاسِ مَا <br>\
                  وَلَّاهُمْ عَنْ قِبْلَتِهِمْ [as meaning <i>The light-witted of the people continually say, What hath turned them away,</i> or <i>back, from their kibleh?</i>]; affirming that this was revealed after their saying مَا وَلَّاهُمْ: but this the grammarians know not; and that this verse was revealed after their saying ما ولّاهم is not a fact agreed upon: moreover, if it be conceded, still continuance is inferred from the aor.; like as when you say, فُلَانٌ يَقْرِى الضَّيْفَ and يَصْنَعُ الجَمِيلَ, you mean that it is his custom to do thus. (Mughnee.) Z asserts that when it is prefixed to a verb signifying what is liked or disliked, it denotes that the event will inevitably happen: i. e., when it is prefixed to a verb signifying a promise or a threat, it corroborates and confirms its meaning. (Mughnee.)       -A3-  [As a numeral, س denotes <i>Sixty.</i>]   </entryFree> <br>\
