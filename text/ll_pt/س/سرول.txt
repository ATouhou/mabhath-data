                   a Pers. word, (S, * M, Msb, * K,) originally شَلْوَار, (MA, KL, [in the former loosely expl. by the word اـِزَارٌ, and so in the PS,]) of well-known meaning, (S,) [<i>Drawers, trousers,</i> or <i>breeches;</i> originally applied to <i>such as are worn under other clothing;</i>] <i>a certain under-garment;</i> (MA;) [but now applied also to <i>such as are worn externally;</i>] is masc. [and perfectly decl., i. e. with tenween], and fem. [and imperfectly decl., i. e. without tenween]; (S, M, Msb, K; *) sometimes masc., (Msb, K,) but not known to As otherwise than as fem.; (M;) accord. to the usage most commonly obtaining, it is imperfectly decl. and fem.: (MF:) Sb says that it is a sing., and is a foreign, or Pers., word, arabicized; resembling, in their [the Arabs&#39;] language, what is imperfectly decl. [as a pl. of the measure فَعَالِيلُ] when determinate and when indeterminate; but is perfectly decl. when indeterminate; and imperfectly decl. if applied as a proper name to a man, and so is its dim. if so applied, because it is fem. and of more than three letters: (S:) or it is imperfectly decl. as a proper name because it is also originally a foreign word; and its dim., ↓ <br>\
      سُرَيْيِيل, [for سُرَيْوِيل, the و being changed into ى, as in سَيِّدٌ for سَيْوِدٌ,] is perfectly decl. unless used as a proper name, in which latter case it is imperfectly decl. [for the reason above mentioned or] because it is fem. and determinate: (IB, TA:) it (i. e. سَرَاوِيل) is made, as a pl., imperfectly decl. when indeterminate by some of the grammarians; (S;) and it occurs in poetry imperfectly decl. [when indeterminate]: (S, M, * IB, TA:) [but this may be by poetic license:] thus in the saying of Ibn-Mukbil, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

      سِرْوِيلٌ, which is [said to be] the only instance of a word of the measure فَعْوِيلٌ: (K:) [this, therefore, confirms the opinion that I hold, that the measure of this word is فِعْلِيلٌ, and that all the words of the present art. are quadriliteral-radical, agreeably with an assertion in the TA that سرل is not genuine Arabic: though it seems that all the lexicographers regard  the و in the words of this art. as augmentative:] a poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

      سِرْوَالٌ masc.: (Msb:) سَرَاوِين is a dial. var.; (K;) or syn. with سَرَاوِيل; the ن in the former being asserted by Yaakoob to be a substitute for the ل [in the latter]: (M:) and شِرْوَالٌ, with ش, is likewise a dial. var. [of سِرْوَالٌ], (K,) mentioned by Es-Sijistánee, on the authority of some one or more of the Arabs: (TA:) [the common modern pronunciation is شَرْوَال: pl. شَرَاوِيل.]    </entryFree> <br>\
