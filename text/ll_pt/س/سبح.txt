(T, TA.) ―         -b2-  سُبْحَانَ is a proper name in the sense of التَّسْبِيح, and [for this reason, and also because it ends with ا and ن,] it is imperfectly decl., and is also invariable; being put in the accus. case in the manner of an inf. n.

You say سُبْحَانَ اْللّٰهِ, meaning <i>I declare</i> [or <i>celebrate</i> or <i>extol</i>] <i>the remoteness,</i> or <i>freedom, of God</i> [<i>from every imperfection</i> or <i>impurity,</i> or <i>from everything derogatory from his glory,</i> i. e.] <i>from the imputation of there being any equal to Him, or any companion, or anything like unto Him, or anything contrary to Him;</i> or <i>from everything that should not be imputed to Him:</i> (L:) [<i>I declare,</i> or <i>celebrate,</i> or <i>extol, his absolute perfection</i> or <i>glory</i> or <i>purity:</i> or <i>extolled be his absolute perfection</i> &amp;amp;c.:] or <i>I declare the remoteness of God,</i> or <i>his freedom</i> (بَرَا=ءَة), <i>from evil,</i> (Zj, * S, K, TA,) or <i>from every evil;</i> (TA;) and [especially] <i>from the imputation of his having a female companion, and offspring:</i> (K:) or <i>I declare God&#39;s being very far removed from all the foul imputations of those who assert a plurality of gods:</i> (MF:) [it sometimes implies wonder, and may well be rendered <i>how far is God from every imperfection!</i> &amp;amp;c.:] in this case, سبحان is a determinate noun; (K;) i. e., a generic proper name, for التَّسْبِيح, like as بَرَّةُ is for البِرُّ. (MF:) Zj says, (TA,) it is put in the accus. case in the manner of an inf. n.; (S, K;) i. e., as the absolute complement of a verb understood; the phrase with the verb supplied being اُسَبِّحُ اْللّٰهَ سُبْحَانَهُ; (MF;) meaning اُبَرِّيُ <br>\
                  اْللّٰهَ مِنَ السُّوْءِ بَرَا=ءَةً; (S, K, MF;) سبحان thus supplying the place of the verb: accord. to Ibn-El-Hájib and others, when it is prefixed to another noun or pronoun, governing it in the gen. case, it is a quasi-inf. n.; and when not so prefixed, it is a proper name, imperfectly decl.: but to this it is objected that a proper name may be thus prefixed for the purpose of distinction, as in the instances of حَاتِمُ طَيِّيٍ and زَيْدُ الفَوَارِسِ: some say that it is an inf. n. of an obsolete verb; but this assertion is not to be regarded; for, as an inf. n., its verb is سَبَحَ, like شَكَرَ of which the inf. n. is شُكْرَانٌ: others say that it may be an inf. n. of سَبَّحَ, though far from being agreeable with analogy: and some derive it from السَّبْحُ as signifying “ the act of swimming, ” or “ the being quick, or swift, ” or “ the being, or becoming, remote, ” &amp;amp;c.: (MF:) [hence F adds,] or the phrase above-mentioned denotes quickness in betaking oneself to God, and agility in serving, or obeying, Him; [and therefore may be rendered <i>I betake myself quickly to the service of God, and am prompt in obeying Him;</i>] (K;) so accord. to ISh, to whom a man presented himself in a dream, and indicated this explanation of the phrase, deriving it from سَبَحَ الفَرَسُ [“ the horse ran stretching forth his fore legs, as one does with his arms in swimming ”]. (L.) فَسُبْحَانَ اْللّٰهِ حِينَ تُمْسُونَ وَحِينَ تُصْبِحُونُ, [in which سبحان is used in the place of the inf. n. of سَبَّحَ, and سَبِّحُوا is understood before it,] in the Kur [xxx. 16], means <i>Therefore perform ye prayer to God</i> [or <i>declare ye the remoteness of God from every imperfection</i> &amp;amp;c.] <i>when ye enter upon the time of evening and when ye enter upon the time of daybreak.</i> (Fr, TA.) And سُبْحَانَ اْللّٰهِ عَمَّا يَصِفْونَ, in the Kur xxiii. 93, means <i>Far</i> [or <i>how far</i>] <i>is God from that</i> by <i>which they describe</i> Him! (Jel.) One says also, سُبْحَانَكَ اْللّٰهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ, meaning سَبَّحْتُكَ بِجَمِيعِ <br>\
                  ا=لَايِكَ وَبِحَمْدِكَ سَبَّحْتُكَ [i. e. <i>I glorify Thee by</i> <br>\
                   enumerating <i>all thy benefits, and by the praising of Thee I glorify Thee</i>]. (Mgh. [See also the prep. بِ.]) ―         -b3-  سُبْحَانَ مِنْ كَذَا, (Msb, K,) or سُبْحَانَ اْللّٰهِ مِنْ كَذَا, (S,) and سُبْحَانَ مِنْ فُلَانٍ, (A,) are (tropical:)  phrases expressive of wonder (S, A, Msb, K) at a thing (S, Msb, K) and a person; (A;) originating from God&#39;s being glorified (اَنْ يُسَبَّحَ اْللّٰهُ) at the sight of what is wonderful of his works, and afterwards, by reason of its being frequently said, employed in relation to anything at which one wonders; (Er-Radee, TA;) meaning (assumed tropical:)  [<i>I wonder greatly</i> (lit., <i>with wondering</i>) <i>at such a thing</i> and <i>such a person;</i> as is shown by what follows; or] <i>how extraordinary,</i> or <i>strange, is such a thing</i> [and <i>such a person!</i>].

(MF.) ―         -b4-  سُبْحَانًا, thus with tenween, as an indeterminate noun, occurs in the phrase سُبْحَانَهُ ثُمَّ سُبْحَانًا, in a poem of Umeiyeh.
