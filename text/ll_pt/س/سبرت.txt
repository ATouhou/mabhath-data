                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>A desert,</i> syn. قَفْرٌ, (S, K,) or <i>a plain,</i> syn. قَاعٌ, (M,) <i>in which is no herbage:</i> (M, K:) or <i>weak land:</i> (TA:) and اَرْضٌ سُبْرُوتٌ and ↓ <br>\
      سِبْرِيتٌ (As, Lh, M) and ↓ <br>\
      سِبْرَاتٌ (M) <i>Land in which is no herbage;</i> (M;) or <i>land in which is nothing:</i> (As, Lh, M:) pl. سَبَارِيتُ and سَبَارٍ, the latter anomalous, mentioned by Lh: (M:) accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, the pl. سَبَارِيتُ signifies <i>deserts,</i> or <i>waterless deserts,</i> (فَلَوَاتٌ,) <i>in which is nothing:</i> and accord. to As, <i>land</i> [or <i>lands</i>] <i>in which nothing grows:</i> (TA:) and one says also اَرْضٌ سَبَارِيتُ, (M, K,) a phrase of the same class as ثَوْبٌ اَخْلَاقٌ, (K,) as though the sing. سُبْرُوتٌ or سِبْرِيتٌ were applied to every portion thereof. (M.) ―         -b2-  Hence, (TA,) applied to a man, (AZ, S, TA,) <i>Needy, in want, indigent,</i> (AZ, As, S, M, K, TA,) <i>poor,</i> (AZ, As, K, TA,) <i>possessing little,</i> (M, TA,) or, as some say, <i>possessing nothing;</i> (S, * M, TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      سِبْرِيتٌ signifies the same, (AZ, S, M, K,) as also ↓ <br>\
      سِبْرَاتٌ, and ↓ <br>\
      سُبْرُتٌ: (M, K:) also <i>bankrupt,</i> or <i>insolvent;</i> syn. مُفْلِسٌ: (TA in explanation of the first [but equally applying to all]:) the epithet applied to a woman is سُبْرُوتَةٌ and ↓ <br>\
      سِبْرِيتَةٌ; (AZ, S;) the latter of which is applied to a man [app. in intensive sense, agreeably with analogy,] as well as to a woman: (M:) and the pl. is سَبَارِيتُ, applied to men and to women. (AZ, S.) ―         -b3-  [Hence, also,] applied to a youth, or young man, <i>Beardless;</i> or <i>having no hair upon the sides of his face.</i> (M, K, TA. [In the K, this signification is immediately followed by the mention of the pls. سَبَارِيتُ and سَبَارٍ.]) ―         -b4-  And <i>Little,</i> or <i>small, in quantity</i> or <i>number;</i> (S, M, K;) <i>paltry,</i> or <i>inconsiderable:</i> (K:) applied to a thing, (S, K,) and (S) to property, or cattle. (S, M.) ―         -b5-  Also <i>Tall,</i> or <i>long.</i> (M, TA.) ―         -b6-  And <i>A skilful,</i> or <i>an expert, guide, well acquainted with the lands.</i> (TA.) It is mentioned by Sb, who says that it is of measure فُعْلُولٌ, like زُنْبُورٌ and عُصْفُورٌ; and most hold him to be right: but some of the authors on inflection assert that it is of the measure فُعْلُوتٌ, from سَبَرْتُ الشَّىْءَ meaning “ I tried, proved, or tested, the thing, or proved it by experiment or experience; ” and that the ت is added to give intensiveness to the signification; which several deny: (MF, TA:) سُبْرُورٌ, however, is mentioned in the K, in art. سبر, as meaning “ poor, ” and land “ in which is no herbage. ” (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
