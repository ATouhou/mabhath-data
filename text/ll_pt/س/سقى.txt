                  , aor. يَسْقِيهِ, (K,) inf. n. سَقْىٌ; (TA; [see also سِقَايَةٌ, which is likewise said to be an inf. n. of the same verb;]) and ↓ <br>\
      سقّاهُ, (K,) with teshdeed; (TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      اسقاهُ; (K, TA; [in the CK, erroneously, اسْتَقاهُ;]) all have one meaning; (TA;) [i. e. <i>He gave him to drink,</i> generally water, often milk, and sometimes poison or some other thing: and the first often signifies <i>he watered him,</i> namely, a beast; and in like manner seed produce &amp;amp;c., i. e. <i>irrigated it;</i> as will be shown by what follows:] or سَقَاهُ [is said when you mean <i>he gave him drink</i>] لِشَفَتِهِ [<i>to his lip</i>], (S,) or بِالشَّفَةِ [<i>by means of the lip</i>], as also ↓ <br>\
      سقّاهُ; and ↓ <br>\
      اسقاهُ means <i>he directed him to water,</i> (K,) or <i>he watered</i> (سَقَى) <i>his cattle</i> or <i>his land:</i> (S, * K:) or both of them, (K, TA,) i. e. سَقَاهُ and ↓ <br>\
      اسقاهُ, (TA,) signify <i>he assigned to him,</i> or <i>gave to him,</i> (جَعَلَ لَهُ,) <i>water,</i> (K, TA,) or <i>drink,</i> or <i>water for irrigation;</i> so that سَقَاهُ is like كَسَاهُ, and ↓ <br>\
      اسقى is like ا=َلْبَسَ, as Sb says: (TA:) or, as some say, سَقَيْتُهُ <br>\
                  <i>I gave him water to his mouth;</i> and ↓ <br>\
      اَسْقَيْتُهُ, <i>I assigned to him,</i> or <i>gave to him,</i> (جَعَلْتُ لَهُ,) <i>drink,</i> or <i>water for irrigation, that he might do as he would;</i> and like them are كَسَوْتُهُ and اَكْسَيْتُهُ: (Ham p. 45:) Er-Rághib says that السَّقْىُ signifies <i>the giving one drink;</i> and ↓ <br>\
      الاـِسْقَا=ءُ, <i>the giving</i> one <i>drink so that he may take it howsoever he will;</i> so that the latter is more ample in meaning than the former. (TA.) Both سَقَى and ↓ <br>\
      اسقى are sometimes used in relation to what is in the bellies of camels or other cattle; [meaning their milk;] as in the Kur [xxiii. 21], where it is said, مِمَّا فِى بُطُونِهَا ↓ <br>\
      نُسْقِيكُمْ, or نَسْقِيكُمْ, [i. e. <i>We give  you to drink of what is in their bellies,</i>] accord. to different readings. (TA.) One says, سَقَاهُ المَا=ءَ, [<i>He gave him to drink water,</i> or <i>the water,</i>] inf. n. as above: (Mgh:) and المَا=ءَ ↓ <br>\
      سَقَّيْتُهُ [<i>I gave him to drink water,</i> or <i>the water, much,</i> or <i>often</i>]: the teshdeed denotes muchness, or frequency. (S.) [See also a tropical usage of the former verb in a verse cited in p. 85, col. 3: and another, from Tarafeh, in p. 134, col. 3. One says also, سَقَى المَا=ءَ, without a second objective complement, <i>He supplied,</i> or <i>gave, water,</i> or <i>the water.</i>] And سَقَيْتُ الزَّرْعَ, [<i>I watered,</i> or <i>irrigated, the seed-produce,</i>] inf. n. as above; as also ↓ <br>\
      اَسْقَيْتُهُ, (Msb.) And سَقَيْتُ فِى القِرْيَةِ and فِيهَا ↓ <br>\
