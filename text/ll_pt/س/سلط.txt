      سَلْطَنَةٌ: (Bd in iii. 144:) <i>predominance;</i> the <i>possession,</i> or <i>exercise, of superior power</i> or <i>force,</i> or <i>of dominion,</i> or <i>authority,</i> and <i>power,</i> or <i>of absolute dominion</i> or <i>authority and power;</i> (Mgh;) as also ↓ <br>\

                  تَسَلُّطٌ [used as a subst.]; (Mgh;) and the latter being the subst. from تَسَلَّطَ: (S:) <i>power of dominion; sovereign,</i> or <i>ruling, power;</i> (M;) [in this sense, as well as in the first,] <i>i. q.</i> ↓ <br>\
      سَلْطَنَةٌ; (Msb;) <i>power of a king;</i> (Lth, Mgh, K;) and <i>of a governor;</i> (Mgh, Msb;) [i. e.] <i>delegated power,</i> or <i>power given to one who is not a king;</i> (TA;) also written سُلْطَانٌ; (M, Msb, K;) which is the only instance of this form: (Msb:) it is masc. and fem.; (M, TA;) generally masc., in the opinion of the skilful; but sometimes fem.; so say IAmb and Zj and others: (Msb:) but ISk says that it is fem. (TA.) One says, (ISk,) or some say, (Msb,) قَضَتْ بِهِ السُّلْطَانُ (ISk, Msb) <i>The sovereign,</i> or <i>ruling, power</i> (↓ <br>\
      السَّلْطَنَةُ) <i>decreed it.</i> (Msb.) And Aboo-Zuheyr says, I heard one, in whose chasteness of speech I have confidence, say, اَتَتْنَا سُلْطَانٌ جَايِرَةٌ [<i>A tyrannical sovereign,</i> or <i>ruling, power, came to us</i>]. (Msb.) It is said in a trad., اـِلَّا اَنْ تَسْاَلَ <br>\
                  ذَا سُلْطَان ٍ, meaning <i>Unless thou ask the ruler,</i> or <i>governor,</i> or <i>the king,</i> for thy due from the public treasury. (Mgh.) And you say, قَدْ جَعَلْتُ لَكَ <br>\
                  سُلْطَانًا عَلَى اَخْذِ حَقِّى مِنْ فُلَان ٍ <br>\
                  <i>I have given thee power,</i> or <i>authority, to take,</i> or <i>receive, my due from such a one.</i> (TA.) And لَا يَوُمُّ الرَّجُلُ الرَّجُلَ <br>\
                  فِى سُلْطَانِهِ [<i>A man shall not take precedence of a man in his authority</i>]; meaning, in his house, and where he has predominance, or superior power, or authority; nor shall he sit upon his cushion; for in doing so he would show him contempt. (Mgh.) ―         -b2-  <i>Strength,</i> or <i>hardness,</i> of anything: (M, K:) <i>sharpness</i> of anything: <i>force,</i> or <i>violence,</i> of anything. (TA.) The <i>vehemence</i> of winter. (TK.) <i>An excited and predominant state</i> of the blood; or <i>inflammation</i> thereof. (IDrd, M, K.) The <i>flaming,</i> or <i>blazing,</i> of fire. (IDrd.) ―         -b3-  <i>A proof; an evidence; an argument;</i> <br>\
                  <i>a plea; an allegation;</i> syn. حُجَّةٌ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) and بُرْهَانٌ: (S, Msb:) a حُجَّة being thus called because of the force with which truth attacks the mind: (B:) or, accord. to Mohammad Ibn-Yezeed, from سَلِيطٌ, (M, TA,) signifying “ oil of olives, ” because it enlightens: (TA:) and in these senses it has no pl., because it is used in the place of an inf. n. (S, TA.) Accord. to I&#39;Ab, it signifies حُجَّة wherever it occurs in the Kur. (TA.) But in the words of the Kur [xvii. 35], فَقَدْ جَعَلْنَا لِوَلِّيِهِ سُلْطَانًا, the meaning may be either [<i>We have given to his executor,</i> or <i>heir,</i>] <i>authority, and power,</i> or <i>absolute authority and power,</i> or <i>the like;</i> or <i>a plea,</i> or <i>the like.</i> (Mgh.) And again, in the Kur [lxix. 29], هَلَكَ عَنِّى <br>\
                  سُلْطَانِيَهْ, the meaning may be <i>My dominion,</i> and <i>my authority and power over men, has perished from me;</i> or <i>my plea.</i> (Bd, B.) And sometimes it means <i>A miracle;</i> as in the words of the Kur [li. 38], اـِذْ اَرْسَلْنَاهُ اـِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ بِسُلْطَان ٍ مُبِين ٍ [<i>When we sent him to Pharaoh with a manifest miracle</i>]. (TA.) Az says that it is sometimes masc. because it has a masc. form; and thus it is in the last of the instances above. (TA.) ―         -b4-  Also <i>A ruler,</i> or <i>governor,</i> or <i>the like; a king; a sovereign;</i> (S, K, TA;) <i>a khaleefeh:</i> (TA:) these are its most common applications [in the writings of post-classical times]: (TA:) thus applied because the person so called is made to predominate; to have, or exercise, superior power or force; to have dominion, or the like: or because he is one of the evidences of God: (Aboo-Bekr, TA:) or because he possesses proof or evidence [of his right]: or because by him pleas and rights are established: (TA:) or because he enlightens the earth, (Msb, * B,) and is of great usefulness; (B;) the word being derived from سَلِيطٌ [signifying “ olive-oil ”]: (Msb:) it is of the measure فُعْلَانٌ: (S:) and when [thus] applied to a person, it is masc.: (Msb:) or it is masc. and fem.: (S, TA:) accord. to Mohammad Ibn-Yezeed, (TA,) fem. because it is [originally] pl. of سَلِيطٌ applied to “ oil; ” as though the kingdom shone by him; or because it has the signification of حُجَّةٌ: and sometimes masc., because regarded as meaning a man; (K, TA;) or because regarded as a sing.: so says Mohammad Ibn-Yezeed; but Az observes that none beside him says this: Fr says that he who makes it masc. regards it as meaning رَجُلٌ; and he who makes it fem. regards it as meaning حُجَّةٌ: (TA:) the pl. is سَلَاطِينُ. (S, Msb.) It is also, itself, sometimes used as a pl.; as in the phrase سَيِّدُ السُّلْطَانِ, used by a poet, meaning سَيِّدُ السَّلَاطِينَ [<i>The lord of kings</i>]; i. e. <i>the khaleefeh:</i> [but this may be rendered <i>the lord of sovereign power,</i> &amp;amp;c.:] or, as some say, the latter word is here pl. of سَلِيطٌ, like as رُغْفَانٌ is pl. of رَغِيفٌ.
