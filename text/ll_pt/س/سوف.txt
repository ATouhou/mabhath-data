                  اَفْعَلُ [<i>I will do</i> such a thing]. (Sb, S.) And one may not introduce a separating word between it and its verb, [except in a case mentioned in what follows,] because it occupies the place of the س in سَيَفْعَلُ [&amp;amp;c.]. (Sb, S.) [But] it is distinct from سَ by its [sometimes] having ل prefixed to it; as in [the phrase in the Kur xciii. 5], وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ <br>\
                  رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَى [<i>And thy Lord will give thee, and thou wilt be well pleased</i>]: (Mughnee:) in this phrase, [however,] the ل is [considered as] pre-  fixed to the verb, not to the particle: (M:) or the phrase is elliptical, for لَاَنْتَ سَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ. (Bd.) And it is distinct from سَ in this, that it is sometimes separated [from its verb] by a verb divested of government both as to the letter and the meaning; as in the saying, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
