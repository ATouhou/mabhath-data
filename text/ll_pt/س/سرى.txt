      اسرى signifies the same (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) in the dial. of El-Hijáz, (S, Msb,) inf. n. اـِسْرَا=ءٌ; (M;) as also ↓ <br>\
      استرى; (M, K;) and perhaps ↓ <br>\
      تسرّى likewise. (Mgh.) [See also سُرًى and سَرْيَةٌ below.] It is said in a prov., قُنْفُذٍ ↓ <br>\
      ذَهَبُوا اـِسْرَا=ءَ [<i>They went away in the manner of a hedge-hog&#39;s night-travelling;</i> meaning <i>they went away by night</i>]; because the قنفذ goes all the night, not sleeping. (M.) ―         -b2-  [Hence, as denoting unseen progress,] it is said also of the root of a tree, meaning <i>It crept along beneath the ground;</i> (Az, M, K;) aor. as above, (M,) inf. n. سَرْىٌ. (TA.) ―         -b3-  And it is said of ideal things, as being likened to corporeal things; tropically, and by extension of the signification; (Msb, TA;) or metaphorically; [as, for instance,] of calamities, and wars, and anxieties: (M, TA:) and the predominant inf. ns. [in these cases] are سِرَايَةٌ and سَرَيَانٌ. (TA.) One says, سَرَى عِرْقُ <br>\
                  السُّوْءِ فِى الاـِنْسَانِ (tropical:)  [<i>The root,</i> or <i>strain, of evil crept in the man</i>]. (Es-Sarakustee, Msb, TA.) And سَرَى فِيهِ السَّمُّ (tropical:)  [<i>The poison crept in him,</i> or <i>pervaded him</i>]; and similarly one says of wine; and of the like of these two things. (El-Fárábee, Msb, TA. [See also دَبَّ.]) And the lawyers say, سَرَى الجُرْحُ اـِلَى النَّفْسِ (tropical:)  [<i>The wound extended to the soul</i>], meaning that the pain of the wound continued until death ensued in consequence thereof: (Mgh, * Msb, TA:) and قُطِعَ كَفُّهُ فَسَرَى <br>\
                  اـِلَى سَاعِدِهِ (tropical:)  [<i>His hand was cut off, and it extended to his upper arm</i>], meaning that the effect of the wound passed by transmission: and سَرَى <br>\
                  التَّحْرِيمُ, and العِتْقُ, (tropical:)  <i>The prohibition,</i> and <i>the emancipation,</i> [<i>extended,</i> or] <i>passed by transmission:</i> phrases current among the lawyers, but not mentioned in books of repute, though agreeable with others here preceding and following. (Msb, TA.) One says also, سَرَى عَلَيْهِ الهَمُّ (tropical:)  <i>Anxiety came to him</i> [or <i>upon him</i>] <i>by night:</i> and سَرَى <br>\
                  هَمُّهُ (tropical:)  <i>His anxiety went away.</i> (Msb, TA.) And similar to these is the phrase in the Kur [lxxxix. 3], وَاْللَّيْلِ اـِذَا يَسْرِ (tropical:)  <i>And by the night when it goes away:</i> (Msb, TA:) or, as some say, <i>when one journeys in it;</i> like as one says لَيْلٌ نَايِمٌ meaning “ night in which one sleeps: ” the [final] ى [of the verb] is elided because it terminates a verse. (TA.) ―         -b4-  It is made trans. by means of ب: (Msb:) one says, سَرَى بِهِ [<i>He made him to journey,</i> or <i>travel,</i> or <i>he transported him, by night,</i> or <i>in the night;</i> or it may be rendered <i>he journeyed,</i> or <i>travelled, with him, by night,</i> or <i>in the night</i>]; (M, Msb, K;) and in like manner, [and more commonly,] بِهِ ↓ <br>\
      اَسْرَى; (S, M, Msb, K;) and ↓ <br>\
      اَسْرَاهُ; (S, M, K;) like as one says, اَخَذَ بِالخِطَامِ as well as اخذ الخِطَامَ. (S.) As to the saying in the Kur [xvii. 1], سُبْحَانَ اْلَّذِى <br>\
                  بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا ↓ <br>\
      اَسْرَى [<i>Extolled be the glory of Him who transported his servant by night!</i>], it is an instance of corroboration, (S, K, * TA,) like the saying, سِرْتُ اَمْسِ نَهَارًا and البَارِحَةَ لَيْلًا: (S, TA:) or the meaning is [simply] سَيَّرَهُ: (K, TA:) accord. to &#39;Alam-ed-Deen Es-Sakháwee, لَيْلًا is added, although الاـِسْرَا=ء is not otherwise than by night, because the space over which he was transported is not to be traversed in less than forty days, but was traversed by him in one night; as though the meaning [intended] were, فِى لَيْلٍ وَاحِدٍ; and it denotes wonder: لَيْلًا is here used instead of لَيْلَةً because when they say سَرَى <br>\
                  لَيْلَةً the meaning generally is <i>he occupied the whole of the night in journeying:</i> Er-Rághib holds the verb in this instance to be from سَرَاةٌ signifying “ a wide tract of land, ” to belong to art. سرو, and to be like اَجْبَلَ and اَتْهَمَ; the meaning being, <i>who transported his servant over a wide tract of land:</i> but this is strange. (TA.)       -A2-  سَرَى مَتَاعَهُ, (M, K,) aor. يَسْرِى, (M, TA,) inf. n. سَرْىٌ, (TA,) <i>He threw his goods,</i> or <i>utensils and furniture, upon the back of his beast.</i> (M, K.) ―         -b2-  And سَرَى عَنِّى الثَّوْبَ, inf. n. سَرْىٌ, <i>He removed from over me the garment:</i> but و is more approved [as the final radical: see 1 in art, سرو]. (M, TA.) You say, سَرَيْتُ الثَّوْبَ and ↓ <br>\
      سَرَّيْتُهُ <br>\
                  <i>I pulled off the garment:</i> and عَنْهُ ↓ <br>\
      سُرِّىَ <br>\
                  <i>It was removed from over him,</i> and <i>removed from its place:</i> the teshdeed denotes intensiveness. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
