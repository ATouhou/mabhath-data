(S in art. سير.) ―         -b2-  An Arab of the desert became the guest of a party, and they ordered the female slave to perfume him; whereupon he said, بَطْنِى عَطِّرِى <br>\
                  وَسَايِرِى ذَرِى [&lt;i&gt;My belly perfume thou, and the rest of me leave thou&lt;/i&gt;]: (K:) but in other lexicons than the K, we find اَعْطِرِى. (TA in art. عطر.) This saying is a well-known prov. (TA.) [In the TA it is added that سايري here signifies &lt;i&gt;the whole of me,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;all of me:&lt;/i&gt; but this is an evident mistake.] You say this to a man who gives you what you do not want, and refuses you what you want. (Sgh, TA in art. عطر.) ―         -b3-  It is related, also, that a hostile attack was made upon a people, and they cried out for aid to the sons of their uncle; but these held back from them until they had been made captives and taken away; then they came inquiring respecting them; and the person asked replied, اَسَايِرَ اليَوْمِ وَقَدْ زَالَ الظُّهْرُ [&lt;i&gt;What, all the day, when the noon has passed?&lt;/i&gt;] (K:) i. e., Dost thou covet what is remote, (مَا بَعُدَ, (S, K, TA, in a copy of the S and in one of the K and in the CK مَا بَعْدُ,) when [reason for] despair hath become manifest to thee: for when one wants the whole day, and the noon has passed, he must despair like as he despairs of accomplishing his want at sunset. (S in art. سير, and K.) This saying is a prov.; (S, A;) and is used with reference to a thing which one hopes to attain when its time has passed. (A.)    &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\
