It is used in this sense, (IKt, TA,) or [rather] is like بِيْسَ, (Bd, Jel,) in the Kur [xvii. 34], where it is said, سَا=ءَ سَبِيلًا [<i>Evil,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>is it as a way of acting</i>]: (IKt, Bd, Jel, TA:) which is like the saying, سَا=ءَ هٰذَا مَذْهَبًا [<i>Evil,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>is this as a way of acting</i> or <i>believing,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: the noun being in the accus. case as a specificative.

(Msb.) You say رَجُلُ سَوْءٍ (S, M, Msb, K) [<i>A man of evil nature</i> or <i>doings;</i> or] <i>a man who does what is evil, displeasing, grievous,</i> or <i>vexatious:</i> (M, TA:) and رَجُلُ السَّوْءِ [<i>the man of evil nature</i> or <i>doings</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (S, K:) and ذِيْبُ السَّوْءِ [<i>the wolf of evil nature</i> &amp;amp;c.], as in a verse cited voce اَحَالَ, in art. حول: (S:) and عَمَلُ سَوْءٍ [<i>a deed of evil nature</i>]: (M, Msb:) and عَمَلُ السَّوْءِ [<i>the deed of evil nature</i>]: (Ham p. 498:) and نَعْتُ سَوْءٍ [<i>an epithet of evil nature</i>]: (O and K in art. سحق:) and سَعْفُ سَوْءٍ <br>\
                  <i>a bad commodity:</i> (O and TA in art. سعف:) and if you make the former word determinate [by means of the article ال], you use the latter as an epithet [also], (M, * Msb, and Ham, p. 712, *) and you say الرَّجُلُ السَّوْءُ [<i>the evil man,</i> or <i>the man who does what is evil</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (Msb, and Ham p. 712:) and العَمَلُ السَّوْءُ [<i>the evil deed</i>]: (Msb:) [this last phrase I hold to be correct, regarding السَّوْءُ in this case as originally an inf. n. of the intrans. verb سَا=ءَ, and therefore capable of being used as an epithet applied to anything; though] IB says that السَّوْءُ used as an epithet is applied to a man but not to a deed: (TA:) [in what here follows from the S, denying the correctness of another phrase mentioned above on the authority of lexicologists of high repute, there is, in my opinion, an obvious mistranscription, twice occurring, السَّوْءُ for السُّوْءُ, which I suppose to have passed from an early copy of that work into most other copies thereof, for I find it alike in all to which I have had access:] Akh says, one should not say الرَّجُلُ السَّوْءُ, though one says الحَقُّ اليَقِينُ as well as حَقُّ اليَقِينِ; for السَّوْءُ is not the same as الرَّجُلُ, but اليَقِينُ is the same as الحَقُّ: he says, also, nor should one say, هٰذَا <br>\
                  رَجُلُ السُّوْءِ with damm: (S:) [here the expres-  sion “ with damm ” may perhaps be meant to refer to السوء in all of the three instances above; not in the last only:] IB says, [in remarking on this passage of the S, in which he appears to have read السُّوْء, with damm, in all of the three instances,] Akh allows one&#39;s saying رَجُلُ السَّوْءِ and رَجُلُ سَوْءٍ, with fet-h to the س in both; but not رَجُلُ السُّوْءِ, with damm to the س, because السُّوْءُ is a subst., meaning “ harm, injury, hurt, mischief, or damage, ” and “ evilness of state or condition; ” and رَجُل is prefixed, as governing a gen. case, only to the inf. n.: and he adds that one says, هٰذَا الرَّجُلُ السَّوْءُ, not prefixing [the former noun to the latter, but using the latter as an epithet].

                  وَالفَحْشَا=ءَ, in the Kur [xii. 24], is said by Zj to mean, [<i>In order that we might turn away from him</i>] <i>unfaithfulness to his master, and adultery.</i> (M, TA.) And سُوْءُ الحِسَابِ, in the Kur [xiii. 18, i. e. <i>The evilness of the reckoning</i>], is expl. by him as meaning a reckoning in which no good work will be accepted, and no evil work passed over; because infidelity will have made the former to be of no avail: or, as some say, it means a reckoning pursued to the utmost extent, in which no evil work will be passed over. (M, TA.) لَا <br>\
                  خَيْرَ فِى قَوْلِ السُّوْءِ means <i>There is no good in</i> thy <i>saying</i> <br>\

      السَّوْء, <i>corruption,</i> or <i>destruction,</i> or <i>perdition:</i> (K, * TA:) or السُّوْء in the phrase دَايِرَةُ السُّوْءِ means <i>defeat</i> and <i>evil;</i> and the reading ↓ <br>\

      اْلظَّانِّينَ بِاْللّٰهِ ظَنَّ اْلسَّوْءِ, (TA,) meaning ظَنَّ الاَمْرِ السَّوْءِ [i. e. <i>Who opine, of God, the opining of the evil thing</i>], (Bd,) it is allowable to read ظَنَّ السُّوْءِ; (T, TA;) and thus some read in this instance: (Jel:) but AM says, in the saying in the Kur [xlviii. 12], ↓ <br>\
      وَظَنَنْتُمْ ظَنَّ السَّوْءِ [<i>And ye opined the evil opining</i>], it is read only with fet-h, and damm to the س is not allowable in this instance, for there is in it no meaning of trial, or affliction, and torment: (TA:) [for this distinction, however, I see no reason; and it is not correct; for] السوء is with fet-h and with damm to the س in the three sentences [whereof this last is one] in which it occurs in this chapter.

                  سَايَةً is held by some to be originally with ء, and of the measure فَعْلَةٌ, from السَّوْءُ; so that the saying means <i>Such a one did to such a one a thing that caused displeasure to him;</i> and <i>did evil to him:</i> others hold that the saying means <i>such a one made a way to do what he desired to such a one;</i> in which case, ساية is of the measure فَعْلَةٌ from سَوَّيْتُ; originally سَوْيَةٌ, which is changed into سَيَّةٌ, and then into سَايَةٌ, in like manner as دِوَّانٌ is changed into دِيوَانٌ.
