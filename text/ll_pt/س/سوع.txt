                   [<i>He bargained with him for work by,</i> or <i>for, the hour,</i>] is from السَّاعَةُ, like مُيَاوَمَةً from اليَوْمُ. (S, K.

      سَاعٌ, (S, Msb, K,) [or the latter is rather a coll. gen. n. of which ساعة is the n. un.,] and سِوَاعٌ. (Msb.) It is used unrestricted in the Kur [vii. 32 and in other places], where it is said, لَا يَسْتَاْخِرُونَ سَاعَةً (Msb) <i>They will not remain behind</i> (Bd) <i>for a time,</i> or <i>any while,</i> (Msb,) or <i>the shortest time:</i> or <i>they shall not seek to remain behind,</i> by reason of intense terror. (Bd.) And so in a trad., where it is said, مَنْ رَاحَ فِى السَّاعَةِ الاُولَى <br>\
                  <i>Whoso goeth in the first time;</i> not in the first astronomical ساعة, for then it would necessarily mean that he who should come in the latter part thereof would be on a par with the former person, which is not the case. (Msb.) [سَاعَةً signifies, as shown above, <i>For,</i> or <i>during, an hour:</i> and <i>awhile; for a little while; during a short time;</i> as in the phrase,] جَلَسْتُ عِنْدَكَ سَاعَةً <br>\
                  <i>I sat with thee,</i> or <i>at thine abode, for a little while,</i> or <i>during a short time.</i> (TA.)

                  <i>An instantaneous poison.</i>] ―         -b2-  السَّاعَةُ also signifies (tropical:)  <i>The resurrection;</i> (S, K, TA;) <i>the raising of mankind for the reckoning;</i> also termed السَّاعَةُ الكُبْرَى: (Er-Rághib, B:) or <i>the time thereof:</i> (K:) because of the quickness with which its reckoning will be accomplished: (TA:) or because it will come suddenly upon mankind, in a moment, and all creatures will die at one cry. (Zj, Az, TA.) Hence, in the Kur [liv. 1], اِقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ (tropical:)  <i>The resurrection</i> [or <i>the time thereof</i>] <i>hath drawn nigh.</i> (Jel, TA.) And [in vii. 186 and lxxix. 42,] يَسْاَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ (tropical:)  <i>They ask thee concerning the resurrection</i> [or <i>the time thereof</i>]. (Bd, Jel, TA.)

(Er-Rághib, B.) ―         -b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  <i>The death of any man;</i> termed, for distinction, السَّاعَةُ الصُّغْرَى: as in the Kur [vi. 31], قَدْ خَسِرَ اْلَّذَينَ كَذَّبُوا بِلِقَا=ءِ <br>\
