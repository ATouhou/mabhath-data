                     سَيَّحَ<br>\
                   [سيّح is said by Golius, as on the authority of the K, to signify <i>He made</i> water <i>to flow:</i> and this is probably its primary and proper signification, whence other meanings, which are tropical: but it is not in the K.] ―         -b2-  See 4. ―         -b3-  سيّح فُلَانٌ, [app. for سيّح كَلَامَهُ,] inf. n. تَسْيِيحٌ, (tropical:)  <i>Such a one talked much.</i> (A, TA.) ―         -b4-  And سُيِّحَ, inf. n. as above, (assumed tropical:)  <i>It</i> (a garment, or piece of cloth,) <i>had in it</i> [or <i>was diversified with</i>] <i>various stripes.</i> (L.)

      سيّح signifies the same: (A, L:) or both of these verbs, said of a horse, are <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  رَفَّضَ [q. v.]. (TA in art. رفض.) ―         -b3-  And اساح بِذَنَبِهِ, said of a horse, (assumed tropical:)  <i>He let his tail hang down loosely:</i> (K:) accord. to the K, J is in error in writing this verb اشاح; and Az says that اساح is right, and that اشاح is a mistranscription: the like is also said in the TS: but اشاح is asserted by more than one to be the right word.

                  الصَّخْرَةُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [<i>And the mass of rock</i>] <i>became impelled and riven:</i> and hence, [accord. to some,] the ↓ <br>\

                   or مَسَاحَةٌ, the latter of the measure مَفْعَلَةٌ, from السِّيَاحَةُ, [each app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>A place of</i> <br>\
