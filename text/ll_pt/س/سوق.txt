      سوّقها; (TA;) or تَسْوِيقٌ, the inf. n. [or this last], signifies the <i>driving well:</i> (KL:) [and accord. to Freytag, ↓ <br>\
      استساق, followed by an accus., signifies the same as سَاقَ as expl. above; but for this he names no authority.] Hence, in the Kur [lxxv. 30], اـِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَيِذٍ المَسَاقُ (TA) i. e. <i>To thy Lord,</i> and his judgment, <i>on that day, shall be the driving.</i> (Bd, Jel.)

      اساقهُ; (Msb, K;) (tropical:)  <i>He sent to the woman her dowry;</i> (K, TA;) or <i>conveyed it,</i> or <i>caused it to be conveyed, to her;</i> (Msb;) though consisting of dirhems or deenárs; because the dowry, with the Arabs, originally consisted of camels, which are driven. (TA.) And hence, مَاسُقْتَ اـِلَيْهَا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>What didst thou give her as her dowry?</i> occurring in a trad.; or, as some related it, مَا سُقْتَ مِنْهَا, i. e. <i>What didst thou give for her,</i> or <i>in exchange for her?</i> (TA.)

(ISh, TA.)       -A2-  سَاقَهُ, (K,) first pers. سُقْتُهُ, (S,) aor. as above, inf. n. سَوْقٌ, (TA,) also signifies <i>He hit,</i> or <i>hurt, his</i> (another man&#39;s, S) سَاق [or <i>shank</i>].

                   The <i>shank;</i> i. e. the <i>part between the knee and the foot</i> of a human being; (Msb;) or the <i>part between the ankle and the knee</i> (K, TA) of a human being; (TA;) the ساق of the human foot: (S, TA:) and [the <i>part properly corresponding thereto,</i> i. e. the <i>thigh commonly so called,</i> and also the <i>arm,</i> of a beast;] the <i>part above the</i> <br>\

      سُوَيْقَةٌ: (Msb, TA:) the pl. [of mult.] is سُوقٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and سِيقَانٌ and [of pauc.] اَسْوُقٌ, (S, O, K,) the و in this last being with ء in order that it may bear the dammeh. (O, K.) A poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> meaning <i>The young man has intelligence whereby he lives when his foot directs aright his shank.</i> (IAar, TA.) And one says of a man when difficulty, or calamity, befalls him, كَشَفَ عَنْ سَاقِهِ [lit. <i>He uncovered his shank;</i> meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>he prepared himself for difficulty</i>]: so says IAmb: and hence, he says, (TA, [in which a similar explanation is cited from ISd also,]) they mention the ساق when they mean to express the difficulty of a case or an event, and to tell of the terror occasioned thereby. (K, TA.) Thus, the saying يَوْمَ يُكْشَفُ عَنْ سَاقٍ, (S, K, TA,) in the Kur [lxviii. 42], (S, TA,) [lit. <i>On a day when a shank shall be uncovered,</i>] means (assumed tropical:)  <i>on a day when difficulty,</i> or <i>calamity, shall be disclosed.</i> (I&#39;Ab, Mujáhid, S, K, TA.) It is like the saying, قَامَتِ الحَرْبُ عَلَى سَاقٍ, (S, TA,) which means (assumed tropical:)  <i>The war,</i> or <i>battle, became vehement,</i> (Msb in this art. and in art. حرب,) <i>so that safety from destruction was difficult of attainment:</i> (Id. in art. حرب:) and كَشَفَتِ الحَرْبُ عَنْ سَاقٍ, [as also شَمَّرَتْ عَنْ سَاقِهَا,] i. e. (assumed tropical:)  <i>The war,</i> or <i>battle, became vehement.</i> (Jel in lxviii. 42.) And in like manner, وَاْلْتَفَّتِ اْلسَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ, (K, TA,) in the Kur [lxxv. 29], (TA,) means (assumed tropical:)  <i>And the affliction of the present state of existence shall be combined with that of the final state:</i> (K, TA:) or it means <i>when the</i> [one] <i>leg shall be inwrapped with the</i> other <i>leg by means of the grave-clothes.</i> (TA.) One says also, قَامَ القَوْمُ عَلَى سَاقٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The people</i> or <i>party, became in a state of toil, and trouble,</i> or <i>distress.</i> (TA.) And قَرَعَ لِلْاَمْرِ سَاقَهُ, [originating from one&#39;s striking the shin of his camel in order to make him lie down to be mounted; lit. <i>He struck his shank for the affair;</i>] meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>he prepared himself for the thing,</i> or <i>affair;</i> syn. تَشَمَّرَ: (JK:) or <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, light,</i> or <i>active, and he rose,</i> or <i>hastened, to do the thing;</i> or (assumed tropical:)  <i>he applied himself vigorously,</i> or <i>diligently,</i> or <i>with energy, to the thing,</i> or <i>affair; i. q.</i> <br>\
                  شَمَّرَ لَهُ [q. v.]; (TA;) or تَجَرَّدَ لَهُ. (A and TA in art. قرع [q. v.: see also ظُنْبُوبٌ, in several places].) [It is also said that] اَوْهَتْ بِسَاقٍ means كِدْتُ <br>\
                  اَفْعَلُ [i. e. <i>I nearly,</i> or <i>almost, did</i> what I purposed: but this explanation seems to have been derived only from what here, as in the TA, immediately follows]: Kurt says, describing the wolf, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

(TA.) ―         -b2-  By a secondary application, سَاقٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  [<i>A greave;</i> i. e.] <i>a thing that is worn on the</i> <br>\
                  ساق [or <i>shank</i>] <i>of the leg, made of iron</i> or <i>other material.</i> (Mgh.) ―         -b3-  Also (tropical:)  [The <i>stem, stock,</i> or <i>trunk,</i> i. e.] the <i>part between the</i> <br>\

[of mult.] سُوقٌ (Msb, TA) and سُوقٌ and سُوُوقٌ and سُوُوقٌ <br>\
                   and [of pauc.] اَسْوُقٌ and اَسْوُقٌ. (TA.) It is related in a trad. of Mo&#39;áwiyeh, that a man said, I applied to him to decide in a litigation with the son of my brother, and began to overcome him therein; whereupon he said, Thou art like as Aboo-Duwád says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  تَنْضُب, <i>he will not loose the stem</i> thereof <i>unless grasping a stem</i>]: he meant that no plea of his came to nought but he clung to another; likening him to the chameleon, which places itself facing the sun, and ascends half-way up the tree, or shrub, then climbs to the branches when the sun becomes hot, then climbs to a higher branch, and will not loose the former until it grasps the other. (O, TA. *) ―         -b4-  [Hence, perhaps, as it seems to be indicated in the O,] one says, وَلَدَتْ فُلَانَةُ ثَلَاثَةَ بَنِينَ عَلَى سَاقٍ, (K, [in the copies of which, however, I find ثَلَاثَ put for ثَلَاثَةَ,]) or عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدٍ, (S,) or وَاحِدَةٍ, (O,) i. e. (tropical:)  <i>Such a woman brought forth three sons, one after another, without any girl between them:</i> (S, O, K, TA:) so says ISk: and وُلِدَ لِفُلَانٍ ثَلَاثَةُ <br>\
                  اَوْلَادٍ سَاقًا عَلَى سَاقٍ, i. e. (tropical:)  <i>Three children were born to such a one, one after another.</i> (TA.)

(TA.) ―         -b5-  سَاقٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The <i>soul,</i> or <i>self;</i> syn. نَفْسٌ: hence the saying of &#39;Alee (in the war of the [schismatics called] شُرَاة), لَابُدَّ لِى مِنْ قِتَالِهِمْ وَلَوْ تَلِفَتْ سَاقِى (assumed tropical:)  [<i>There is not for me any way of avoiding combating them, though my soul,</i> or <i>self, should perish</i> by my doing so]. (Abu-l-&#39; Abbás, O, TA.) So too in the saying, قَدَحَ فِى سَاقِهِ [as though meaning (tropical:) <i>He cankered his very soul</i>]: (IAar, TA in art. قدح:) [or] <i>he deceived him, and did that which was displeasing to him:</i> (L in that art.:) or (tropical:)  <i>he impugned his honour,</i> or <i>reputation;</i> from the action of canker-worms (قَوَادِح) cankering the stem, or trunk, of a shrub, or tree.
