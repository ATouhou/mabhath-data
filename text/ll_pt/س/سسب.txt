(M. [Accord. to the K and TA, ↓ <br>\
      السَّيْسَاب is used by Ru-beh for السَّيْسَبَان: but this is evidently a mistake.])    </entryFree> <br>\

      سَيْسَبًى, and also سَيْسَبَى, (which last has been mentioned above on the authority of the K,) for it is immediately added in the TA, “ it is masc. and fem., ” app. indicating that it is with, and without, tenween: then it is there further and strangely added, “ it is brought from India: ”] a rájiz uses the form ↓ <br>\
