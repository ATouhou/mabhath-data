                  <i>He lowered his head, and bent himself;</i> (AA, S, Mgh, K;) said of a man; (AA, S, Mgh;) <i>and put his forehead on the ground:</i> (Mgh:) and likewise said of a camel; (S, A;) in the latter case tropical; (A;) as also سَجَدَ; (A, Mgh, Msb;) meaning (tropical:)  <i>he lowered his head,</i> (S, A, Mgh, Msb,) <i>to be ridden,</i> (S, Mgh,) or <i>to his rider,</i> (A,) or <i>on the occasion of his being ridden,</i> or <i>mounted.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b2-  The سُجُود of prayer is from سَجَدَ in the first of the senses expl. above; (S;) and means The [<i>prostrating oneself;</i>] <i>putting the forehead on the ground:</i> (S, Mgh:) سَجَدَ, (ISd, Msb, TA,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (ISd, TA,) signifies <i>he put his forehead on the ground:</i> (ISd, Msb, TA:) but سُجُود to God denotes a particular manner [of doing this; i. e. the <i>prostrating oneself</i> in prayer <i>by dropping gently upon the knees, placing the palms of the hands on the ground, a little before the place of the knees, and then putting the nose and forehead on the ground, the former first, between the two hands</i>]. (Msb.) ―         -b3-  It is said of Kisrà, in a trad., كَانَ يَسْجُدْ لِلطَّالِع, i. e. <i>He used to lower himself,</i> or <i>bend himself down, to the arrow passing beyond the butt, going over it;</i> which they used to reckon like that which hit the butt; meaning that he used to concede to the shooter thereof: or, accord. to Az, it means that he used to lower his head when his arrow was elevated [too high] above the object shot at, in order that the arrow might be rightly directed, and might hit the circle. (TA.) ―         -b4-  And [as salutation is often accompanied with a bending of the body,] سُجُودٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The act of <i>saluting.</i> (L, TA.) [You say, سَجَدَ لَهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He saluted him.</i> And also (assumed tropical:)  <i>He paid respect,</i> or <i>honour, to him;</i> or <i>magnified him;</i> see Ham p. 294.] ―         -b5-  You say also, سَجَدَتِ النَّخْلَةُ (tropical:)  <i>The palm-tree bent,</i> or <i>inclined,</i> (AHn, Mgh, TA,) by reason of the abundance of its fruit. (Mgh.) And السَّفِينَةُ تَسْجُدُ لِلرِّيحِ (tropical:)  <i>The ship bends,</i> or <i>inclines, by the influence of the wind.</i> (A, TA.) ―         -b6-  وَ اْلنَّجْمُ وَ اْلشَّجَرُ يَسْجُدَانِ, in the Kur [lv. 5], means, accord. to Fr, (assumed tropical:)  [<i>And the herbs and the trees</i>] <i>turn towards the sun and incline with it until the afternoon-shade becomes broken:</i> (TA:) or <i>the herbs and the trees humbly submit to his will.</i> (Bd, Jel.) The سُجُود of inanimate things to God we understand, in the Kur, as denoting obedience to that whereto they are made subservient, and as a fact to be believed without inquiry into the manner thereof. (I&#39;Ab, L.)       -A2-  Also <i>He stood erect:</i> (Lth, Msb, K:) so in the dial. of Teiyi. (Msb.) It is said in the K, immediately after the mention of the first signification and this last, that thus the verb has two contr. meanings: but it may be said that there is no [necessary, or absolute,] contrariety between الخُضُوع and الاِنْتِصَاب.
