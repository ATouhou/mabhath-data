                   a word of which the final radical letter is rejected, (S, Msb,) and of which there are two dial. vars., (Msb,) being, accord. to some, originally سَنْهَةٌ, (S, Msb,) like جَبْهَةٌ (S) or سَجْدَةٌ, (Msb,) and accord to others, سَنْوةٌ, (S, * Msb,) like شَهْوَةٌ, and upon each of these originals are founded modifications of the word, (Msb,) therefore it is mentioned in the K [and S and other lexicons] in the present art. and again in art. سنو, (TA,) <i>A year;</i> syn. حَوْلٌ; (Msb;) or عَامٌ: (M, K:) or, as Suh says, in the R, the سَنَة is <i>longer than the</i> <br>\
                  عَام; the latter word being applied to the [twelve] Arabian months [collectively], and thus differing from the former word: (TA:) with the Arabs <i>it consists of four seasons,</i> mentioned before [in art. زمن, voce زَمَنٌ]: but sometimes it is tropically applied to (tropical:)  <i>a single</i> <br>\
                  فَصْل [or <i>quarter</i>]; as in the saying, دَامَ المَطَرُ السَّنَةَ كُلَّهَا, meaning [<i>The rain continued</i>] <i>during the</i> <br>\

      سُنَيَّةٌ (S, Msb) accord. to those who make the original of سَنَةٌ to be سَنْوَةٌ; (Msb;) and some say سُنَيْنَةٌ, but this is rare: (TA:) the pl. is سَنَهَاتٌ (Msb, K) accord. to those who make the original of سَنَةٌ to be سَنْهةٌ, (Msb,) and سَنَوَاتٌ (Msb, K) accord. to those who make the original of سَنَةٌ to be سَنْوَةٌ; (Msb;) and سِنُونَ also, (S, Msb, K,) like the masc. perfect pl., (Msb,) [agreeably with a rule applying to other cases of this kind,] with kesr, to the س, (S, TA,) and سِنِينَ [in the accus. and gen. cases], (Msb, TA,) so that one says, هٰذِهِ <br>\
                  سِنُونَ [<i>These are years</i>], and رَاَيْتُ سِنِينَ [<i>I saw years</i>], (TA,) and the ن is elided when it is prefixed to another noun, governing the latter in the gen. case, (Msb,) and some say سُنُونَ, with damm to the س; (S, TA;) and in one dial., the ى is retained in all the cases, and the ن is made a letter of declinability, with tenween when the word is indeterminate, [so that one says سِنِينٌ,] and is not elided when the word is prefixed to another noun, governing the latter in the gen. case, because it is [regarded as] one of the radical  letters of the word; and of this dial. is the saying of the Prophet, اَللّٰهُمَّ اْجْعَلْهَا عَلَيْهِمْ سِنِينًا كَسِنِينِ <br>\
                  يُوسُفَ [<i>O God, make them to be to them years like the years of Joseph</i>]; (Msb; [but in my copy of the Mgh, I find كَسِنِى يُوسُفَ;]) or with respect to سِنِينٌ, like مِيِينٌ, with refa [and tenween], there are two opinions; one is, that it is of the measure فِعْلِينٌ, like غِسْلِينٌ, with a rejection [of one letter], though this is an anomalous pl., for there sometimes occurs among pls. that which has no parallel, as عِدًى, and this is the opinion of Akh; the other is, that it is of the measure فَعِيلٌ, changed to فِعِيلٌ because of the kesreh of the second letter; the pl. being in some instances of the measure فَعِيلٌ, like كَلِيبٌ and عَبِيدٌ; but he who holds this opinion makes its final ن to be a substitute for و, and that of مِايَةٌ a substitute for ى: (S:) you may also suppress the tenween in سِنِينٌ; [in which case it seems that one says سِنِينَ in the nom. case (assimilating it to سِنُونَ) as well as in the accus. and the gen.; like as one does in the instances of بُرِين and بِرِين, pls. of بُرَةٌ, accord. to the K, though, as I have shown in art. برو, there is some doubt on this point;] but the suppression of the tenween in سِنِينٌ is more rare than its pronunciation: (I&#39; Ak p. 18:) and another pl. is سُنِىٌّ, [originally سُنُوٌّ,] of the measure فُعُولٌ. (Er-Rághib, TA in art. سنو.) The phrase ثَلٰثَ مِايَةٍ سِنِينَ, in the Kur [xviii. 24], is said by Akh to be for ثَلٰثَمِايَةٍ مِنَ السِّنِينَ [<i>Three hundred of years</i>]: and he says that if the سِنُون be an explicative of the مِايَة, it is in the gen. case [to agree with مِايَةٍ]; and if an explicative of the ثَلٰث, it is in the accus. case [to agree with ثَلٰثَ]. (S. [See also Bd on this phrase; and see De Sacy&#39;s Ar. Gr., 2nd ed., i. 423.]) [لِسَنَةٍ, relating to an animal or a plant or the like, means <i>To</i> the completion of <i>a year:</i> and لِسَنَتِهِ, <i>to</i> the completion of <i>his,</i> or <i>its, year;</i> i. e. <i>in his,</i> or <i>its, first year.</i>] And one says, ↓ <br>\
      لَقِيتُهُ مُنْذُ سُنَيَّاتٍ [<i>I met him some years ago; three or more, to ten, years ago</i>]: a phrase like لَقِيتُهُ ذَاتَ العُوَيْمِ. (Az, TA in art. عوم.) And ↓ <br>\
      سُنَيَّةٌ is a dim. of enhancement, of سَنَةٌ: one says سُنَيَّةٌ حَمْرَا=ءُ <br>\

      وَقَعُوا فِى السُّنَيَّاتِ [<i>They lapsed into the severe years of scantiness of herbage</i>]: these were years that pressed hard upon the people of ElMedeeneh. (K, TA.) ―         -b2-  سَنَةٌ [alone] also signifies (tropical:)  <i>Drought,</i> or <i>barrenness:</i> (Msb, K, TA:) or <i>vehement,</i> or <i>intense, drought:</i> (TA in art. سنو:) an instance of a noun used especially in one of its senses, like دَابَّةٌ applied to “ a horse, ” and مَالٌ applied to “ camels: ” pl., in this, as in the former, sense, سَنَهَاتٌ [and سَنَوَاتٌ] and سِنُونَ and سِنِينٌ. (TA.) One says of a land (اَرْضٌ), اَصَابَتْهَا السَّنَةُ (tropical:)  <i>Drought,</i> or <i>barrenness, befell it.</i> (Msb.) And in like manner one says of people, اَصَابَتْهُمُ السَّنَهُ (tropical:)  [<i>Drought,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>befell them</i>]. (TA.) A seeker of herbage and of a place in which to alight was sent to a tract, and found it dried up by want of rain, and when he returned, being asked respecting it, he said, السَّنَةُ, meaning (tropical:)  <i>Drought,</i> &amp;amp;c. [has befallen it]. (TA.) And it is said in a trad., اَللّٰهُمَّ اَعِنِّى عَلَى مُضَرَبِالسَّنَةِ, i. e. (tropical:)  [<i>O God, aid me against Mudar</i>] <i>by drought</i> &amp;amp;c. (TA.)       -A2-  It is also [used as an epithet,] applied to land (اَرْضٌ), as meaning (tropical:)  <i>Affected with drought,</i> or <i>barrenness;</i> (As, S, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      سَنْهَا=ءُ and سَنْوَا=ءُ. (Msb.) One says likewise, هٰذِهِ بِلَادٌ سِنِينٌ (tropical:)  <i>These are countries,</i> or <i>tracts, affected with drought</i> &amp;amp;c.: and <i>Et-Tirimmáh says</i> <br>\
