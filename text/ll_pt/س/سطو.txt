                   (S, M, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.) and عَلَيْهِ (M, Msb, K,) aor. يَسْطُو, (Msb,) inf. n. سَطْوٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and سَطْوَةٌ, (M, Msb, K,) or the latter is an inf. n. un., (S,) <i>He sprang,</i> or <i>rushed, upon him; made an assault,</i> or <i>attack, upon him;</i> syn. صَالَ: (M, K:) <i>he sprang upon him and seized him violently</i> or <i>laid violent hands upon him:</i> (Bd in xxii. 71:) <i>he seized him violently with uplifted hand:</i> (Er-Rághib, TA:) <i>he overbore him, overpowered him,</i> or <i>subdued him,</i> (قَهَرَهُ, Lth, S, Msb, K, or تَطَاوَلَ عَلَيْهِ, T, TA,) <i>by seizing him violently,</i> or <i>laying violent hands upon him,</i> (Lth, S, K,) <i>and abased him;</i> or <i>he seized him with great violence:</i> (Msb:) or <i>he stretched forth his hand to him</i> [<i>to seize him</i>]. (Th, M, TA.) And in like manner, (M,) one says of a stallion [camel], يَسْطُو عَلَى طَرُوقَتِهِ [<i>He springs,</i> or <i>rushes, upon,</i> or <i>he overbears, the she-camel that he covers</i>]. (S, M. *) ―         -b2-  سَطَا عَلَى <br>\
                  النَّاقَةِ, (S, M, K,) and الفَرَسِ, inf. n. سَطْوٌ and سُطُوٌّ, (M,) <i>He</i> (the pastor) <i>put his hand into the</i> <br>\
                  رَحِم [or <i>vulva</i>] <i>of the she-camel,</i> (S, M, K,) and <i>of the mare,</i> (M,) <i>to extract,</i> (S, K,) or <i>and extracted,</i> (M,) <i>the sperma of the stallion:</i> (S, M, K:) when this is not extracted, the she-camel  does not conceive: (S:) or this is done when she has been leaped by a stallion of low race; or when the sperma is bad, and she has not conceived in consequence of it. (M.) And <i>He extracted from her</i> (i. e. a she-camel, TA) <i>the fœtus, dead:</i> (M, TA:) and مَسَطَ signifies “ he extracted the sperma of the stallion: ” thus Az distinguishes between the two verbs. (TA.) Accord. to IAar, one says, سَطَا عَلَى الحَامِلِ, and سَاطَ, which is formed by transposition, meaning <i>He extracted the fœtus,</i> or <i>young one, of the pregnant female.</i> (TA.) And A&#39;Obeyd mentions السَّطْوُ as used in relation to a woman: it is said in a trad. of El-Hasan, لَا بَاْسَ اَنْ يَسْطُوَ الرَّجُلُ عَلَى المَرْاَةِ [<i>There is,</i> or <i>will be, no harm in the man&#39;s extracting the fœtus of the woman</i>]; (M, TA;) which Lth explains by saying, when her child sticks fast in her belly, dead, it may be extracted [by him] when fear is entertained for her and a woman is not found to do this. (TA.) ―         -b3-  سَطَا said of a horse, (M, K,) inf. n. سَطْوٌ, (M,) <i>He went at random, heedlessly,</i> or <i>in a headlong manner, not obeying guidance.</i> (M, K.) ―         -b4-  Also, said of a horse, <i>He went with wide step:</i> (S, M, K:) or <i>raised his tail in running;</i> the doing of which is approved. (M.) ―         -b5-  Also (tropical:)  <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, abundant,</i> or <i>copious;</i> said of water. (S, M, Msb, K, TA.) ―         -b6-  And (tropical:)  <i>He tasted</i> food; (K, TA;) and <i>took</i> it <i>with the hand,</i> or <i>with the extended hand.</i> (TA.) ―         -b7-  And <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  عَاقَبَ [app. as meaning <i>He punished:</i> see سَطْوَةٌ, below]. (M, TA.) ―         -b8-  And سَطَاهَا <br>\
                  <i>He compressed her;</i> [and so سَطَاَهَا and شَطَاَهَا;] on the authority of Aboo-Sa&#39;eed. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  , (K,) inf. n. مُسَاطَاةٌ, (TA,) <i>He treated him with hardness, severity,</i> or <i>rigour:</i> (K, TA:) so says Az, on the authority of IAar. (TA.) ―         -b2-  And <i>He treated him with gentleness,</i> or <i>tenderness.</i> (IAar, T, TA.) Thus it has two contr. significations. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   [as a simple subst., or] as an inf. n. un., has for its pl. سَطَوَاتٌ. (S.) It signifies [<i>A spring,</i> or <i>rush;</i> or <i>an assault,</i> or <i>attack:</i> &amp;amp;c.: (see 1, first sentence:) <i>impetuosity</i> in war or battle:] <i>a reviling: a beating:</i> and <i>punishment,</i> or <i>chastisement;</i> as in the saying, اِتَّقِ سَطْوَتَهُ [<i>Guard thyself against his punishment,</i> or <i>chastisement;</i> or it may mean in this phrase, <i>his violence,</i> or <i>impetuosity</i>].
