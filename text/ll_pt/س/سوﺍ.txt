(Meyd, TA.) It is said that El-Mahboobee was possessed of riches; and when death visited him, he desired to make a testament; so it was said to him, “ What wilt thou write? ” and he answered, “ Write ye, &#39;Such a one,&#39; meaning himself, &#39;has left what will grieve him, and oppress him by its weight:&#39; ” i. e., property which his heirs will devour, while the burden thereof will remain upon him.
