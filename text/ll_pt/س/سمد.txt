[عَلاءً in the CK is a mistake for عَلا.]) ―         -b2-  <i>He raised his head;</i> (L; [and the same is implied in the S; see سَامِدٌ;]) and so سَمِدَ: (M, L:) [and] <i>he raised his head in pride.</i> (S, L, K.) And in the former sense it is said of a camel, in his going along. (Bd in liii. 61.) ―         -b3-  Also <i>He</i> (a man) <i>stood, raising his head, and with his breast erect;</i> like as the stallion [camel] does when excited by lust: (A:) [for] it is said of a stallion [camel] when thus excited. (L.) ―         -b4-  And hence, (A,) (tropical:)  <i>He sang:</i> (M, A, L:) because the singer raises his head and erects his breast: (A:) but Th says that this is rare: (M:) accord. to I&#39;Ab, سُمُودٌ signifies the act of <i>singing</i> in the dial. of Himyer. (L.) ―         -b5-  Also, (M, K,) aor. as above, (TA,) and so the inf. n., (S, M,) (assumed tropical:)  <i>He diverted himself, sported,</i> or <i>played.</i> (S, M, K, TA. [For لَهِىَ in the CK, I read لَهَا, as in the M, and in MS. copies of the K, and in the TA; and agreeably with the S, in which the inf. n. is expl. as syn. with لَهْوٌ.]) ―         -b6-  <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, negligent, inattentive, inadvertent, inconsiderate,</i> or <i>heedless;</i> and <i>went away from,</i> or <i>relinquished,</i> or <i>left, a thing.</i> (L.) ―         -b7-  <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, confounded, perplexed,</i> or <i>amazed, and unable to see his right course;</i> or <i>affected with wonder;</i> or <i>cut short,</i> or <i>silent, being confounded,</i> or <i>perplexed, and unable to see his right course;</i> syn. بُهِتَ: inf. n. as above: (M:) [or] <i>he stood confounded,</i> or <i>perplexed, and unable to see his right course;</i> syn. قَامَ مُتَحَيِّرًا. (K. [After this explanation and لَهَا immediately following it, it is said in the K, والسُّمُودُ يَكُونُ حُزْنًا وَسُرورًا: meaning that it is by reason of grieving, or mourning, as signifying the “ standing confounded ” &amp;amp;c.; and by reason of rejoicing, or being happy, as signifying the “ diverting oneself ” &amp;amp;c. See as an ex. of its usage in a case of grief the verses which I have cited at the close of the first paragraph of art. رد, and which are cited in the present art. in the L and TA.]) ―         -b8-  Also <i>He kept constantly,</i> or <i>continually,</i> (M, L,) <i>to an affair,</i> (M,) or <i>upon the ground,</i> or <i>in the land.</i> (L.) ―         -b9-  <i>He strove laboured,</i> or <i>exerted himself,</i> or <i>he wearied himself, in work,</i> (K, TA,) and <i>in journeying.</i> (TA.) And سَمَدَتِ الاـِبِلُ (S, M, K) فِى سَيْرِهَا, (S,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (M,) <i>The camels strove, laboured,</i> or <i>exerted themselves, in their journeying:</i> (S, K:) or <i>knew not fatigue,</i> or <i>weariness.</i> (M.) [See also سَمْدٌ, (which is likewise, perhaps,  an inf. n. of the same verb,) below.]       -A2-  سَمَدَهُ, inf. n. سَمْدٌ, <i>i. q.</i> <br>\

                  سَمَاد [q. v.]: (S, Msb, K:) <i>he dunged,</i> or <i>manured, the land;</i> syn. زَبَّلَهَا. (M. [So in a copy of the M: in the TA زبلها, without teshdeed; and thus only, I believe, correctly; though it is commonly pronounced with teshdeed in the present day.])       -A3-  سمد شَعَرَهُ, (M,) or الشَّعَرَ, (K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) <i>He removed utterly his hair,</i> or <i>the hair;</i> (M, K, TA;) <i>taking the whole of it</i> [<i>in shaving</i>]: a dial. var. of سبّد. (TA.) تَسْمِيدُ الرَّاْسِ is <i>The removing utterly the hair of the head</i> [<i>by shaving</i>]: a dial. var. of تَسْبِيد. (S.) ―         -b2-  And تَسْمِيدٌ is also used [alone, the objective complement being app. meant to be understood,] as meaning The <i>leaving off,</i> or <i>neglecting, the anointing of oneself</i> [or <i>of one&#39;s hair</i>], <i>and washing:</i> and so تَسْبِيدٌ.

(A.) ―         -b3-  [And hence, as is indicated in the A, (see 1,)] (assumed tropical:)  <i>A singer;</i> or <i>singing.</i> (M, L; and so in two copies of the S.) And the latter is said to be the meaning of the pl. in the Kur liii. 61. (M, L.) ―         -b4-  [Hence also,] <i>Behaving proudly.</i> (I &#39;Ab in explanation of the pl. in the Kur liii. 61; and IAar.) ―         -b5-  <i>Diverting himself; playing;</i> or <i>sporting.</i> (IAar, S, M; and Bd in liii. 61,) ―         -b6-  <i>Negligent, inattentive, inadvertent, inconsiderate,</i> or <i>heedless.</i> (Lth, IAar A.) Thus the pl. is said by Lth to mean in the Kur liii. 61. (TA.) ―         -b7-  <i>Standing in a state of confusion, perplexity,</i> or <i>amazement:</i> (Mgh:) and so the pl. is said to mean in the Kur liii. 61: (TA:) or <i>confounded, perplexed,</i> or <i>amazed, by reason of inordinate exultation.</i> (IAar.) ―         -b8-  And <i>Silent.</i> (So in a copy of the S.) ―         -b9-  And <i>Grieving,</i> or <i>mourning, and lowly, humble,</i> or <i>submissive.</i> (So, too, in a copy of the S.) ―         -b10-  In the saying of Ru-beh, (K,) describing camels, (TA,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

(TA.) ―         -b11-  سَامِدٌ as an epithet applied to a وَطْب [or skin in which milk is put] means (tropical:)  <i>Full,</i> [<i>so as to be</i>] <i>standing upright.</i> (A, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
