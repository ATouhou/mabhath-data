                  , (K,) inf. n. سَلْتٌ, (M, TA,) <i>He extracted,</i> or <i>made to come forth,</i> [<i>the contents of</i>] <i>the gut</i> [<i>by compressing it</i>] <i>with his hand.</i> (M, K. [In both it is expl. by اَخْرَجَهُ بِيَدِهِ: but it seems that a fault has been accidentally committed by a copyist in the former or in its original, and thence passed into the latter; and that the words which I have supplied are necessary to explain the true meaning. That such is the case, appears from what here follows.]) It is said in the L that السَّلْتُ signifies <i>The griping, with the hand, a thing that is contaminated by dirt,</i> or <i>filth, so that what is in it comes forth;</i> and thus is done with a gut. (TA.) It is also said to signify <i>The extracting,</i> or <i>causing to come forth, what is fluid,</i> or <i>moist, adhering to another thing.</i> (MF, TA.) [Hence,] سَلَتَ خَمْشَهُ i. e. مُخَاطَهُ عَنْ اَنْفِهِ [<i>He cleansed his nose of the mucus that was in it by compressing it with his fingers</i>]: occurring in two trads.; in one of which, the Prophet is related to have been in the habit of doing this to El-Hoseyn when he used to carry him upon his shoulder. (TA.) [Hence, likewise,] it is said in a trad., فَيَنْفُذُ الجَحِيمُ اـِلَى جَوْفِهِ فَيَسْلُتُ مَافِيهِ, i. e. [<i>And the fire of Hell shall penetrate to his inside, and</i>] <i>shall exscind and extirpate what is in it.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  You say also, سَلَتَ القَصْعَةَ, (S, A, K,) aor.      <br>\
                     سَلُتَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. سَلْتٌ; (S;) and ↓ <br>\
      استلتها; (K;) <i>He cleansed the bowl by taking off with his finger what remained upon its sides;</i> (S;) <i>he wiped the bowl</i> (A, K) <i>with his fingers</i> (A) or <i>with his finger.</i> (K.) And سَلَتَتْ خِضَابَهَا عَنْ يَدِهَا, (S, Msb, K,) aor.      <br>\
                     سَلُتَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. سَلْتٌ, (Msb,) <i>She cast from her,</i> or <i>from her hand, the remains of her stuff for dyeing the hands</i> or <i>hair:</i> (S, K:) or <i>she put away,</i> or <i>removed, that stuff from her hand:</i> (Msb:) or <i>she wiped off, and cast away, that stuff from her hand:</i> (TA:) or سَلَتَ الخِضَابَ, aor.      <br>\
                     سَلُتَ<br>\
                  , <i>he took away,</i> and <i>wiped off, the material for dyeing the hands</i> or <i>hair;</i> and in like manner. a similar thing; and sweat; and blood. (Mgh.) سَلَتَ الدَّمَ عَنْهَا occurs in a trad. as meaning <i>He</i>    <br>\
                  <i>removed the blood</i> [<i>from her</i> or <i>it</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b3-  سَلَتَ دَمَ البَدَنَةِ (M, K) means, accord. to Lh, <i>He scraped off the blood of the</i> <br>\
                  بدنة [or <i>beast brought to Mekkeh for sacrifice,</i> or <i>there sacrificed,</i>] <i>with the knife:</i> but [ISd says, (and in like manner هَلَتَ دَمَ البَدَنَةِ is expl. in the L as on the authority of Lh,)] in my opinion the meaning is, <i>he scraped off the skin of the</i> <br>\
                  بدنة <br>\
                  <i>with the knife so that he made its blood to appear.</i> (M. [The explanation in the K is made up from the two different explanations in the M, being as follows: قَشَرَهُ حَتَّى اَظْهَرَ دَمَهَا, as though meaning <i>he scraped off the</i> dried <i>blood of the</i> <br>\
                  بدنة <br>\
                  <i>so that he made its</i> fresh <i>blood to appear:</i> but in the copy of the K followed in the TA, النَّدَبَة (i. e. <i>the scar</i>) is put in the place of البَدَنَة, and the former of these two (i. e. الندبة) I regard as the right word.]) ―         -b4-  سَلَتَ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>He cut off</i> a thing. (K. [This is said in the TA to be the primary meaning: but accord. to the A, the phrase here following, in which it has this meaning, is tropical.]) You say, سَلَتَ اَنْفَهُ, (S, M, A, K,) aor.      <br>\
                     سَلِتَ<br>\
                   and      <br>\
                     سَلُتَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. سَلْتٌ, (M,) (tropical:)  <i>He cut off his nose</i> (S, M, A, K) <i>entirely</i> (TA) with a sword. (S, A.) And سَلَتَ يَدَهُ بِالسَّيْفِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He cut off his hand,</i> or <i>arm, with the sword.</i> (M.) And سَلَتَ شَعَرَهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He shaved off his hair.</i> (M, K.) And سَلَتَ رَاْسَهُ (tropical:)  <i>He shaved his head.</i> (As, S, L.) ―         -b5-  سَلَتَهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He beat, struck,</i> or <i>smote, him:</i> (K, TA:) and <i>flogged him.</i> (TA.) You say, سَلَتُّهُ مِايَةَ سَوْطٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>I inflicted upon him a hundred strokes of the whip.</i> (S, TA.) ―         -b6-  And سَلَتَ بِسَلْحِهِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He cast forth his excrement,</i> or <i>ordure.</i> (K.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  شعير, <i>without husk:</i> or, as some say, <i>a species of wheat;</i> but the explanation next preceding this last is the more correct, for البَيْضَا=ءُ and السُّلْتُ are mentioned in a trad. as distinct, each from the other, and by the former is meant wheat: (TA:) or <i>a species of</i> <br>\
                  شعير <br>\
                  <i>with a thin husk and small grain:</i> (IF, Msb:) or <i>a grain between wheat and barley</i> (شعير), <i>not having a husk like that of the latter, and thus being like wheat in smoothness, and like barley</i> (شعير) <i>in its nature,</i> or <i>quality, and in its coolness:</i> (Az, Msb:) accord. to Es-Seydelánee, <i>like barley</i> (شعير) <i>in its form, and like wheat in its nature,</i> or <i>quality;</i> but this is a mistake: (Ibn-Es-Saláh, Msb:) [<i>gymnocrithon</i> (i. e. <i>hordeum nudym</i>) of Galen: <i>tragus</i> of Diosc.
