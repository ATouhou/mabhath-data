                  , (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. اـِسْرَارٌ; (Msb;) [and accord. to the TA سَرَّهُ; but see the first sentence of this art.;] <i>He concealed it; suppressed it; kept it secret;</i> (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) namely, a story, or the like: (A, Mgh, Msb:) and, contr., <i>he manifested it; revealed it; published it; made it known.</i> (S, M, Msb, K.) Both of these significations have been assigned to the verb in the phrase وَاَسَرُّوا اْلنَّدَامَةَ, in the Kur [x. 55 and xxxiv. 32]: (S:) some say, that the meaning is <i>They will manifest repentance:</i> Th says, <i>they will conceal it</i> from their chiefs: the former [says ISd] is the more correct: (M:) the former meaning is also given on the authority of AO; but Sh says, I have not heard it on the authority of any other; and Az says that the lexicologists most strongly disapprove of the saying of AO; and it is said that the meaning is, <i>they,</i> the chiefs of the polytheists, <i>will conceal repentance</i> from the lower class of their people, whom they shall have caused to err; and in like manner say Zj and the [other] expositors. (TA.) In like manner also the two contr. significations are assigned to the verb in the saying of Imra-el- Keys, [in his Mo&#39;allakah,] لَوْ يُسِرُّونَ مَقْتَلِى, which As used to quote with ش, thus, لَوْ يُشِرُّونَ <br>\
                  مَقْتَلِى, meaning <i>that they might publish,</i> or <i>make known, my slaughter.</i> (S.) You say also, اَسَرَّ اـِلَيْهِ حَدِيثًا <br>\
                  <i>He revealed unto him a story</i> (S, K) <i>secretly.</i> (TA.) An ex. occurs in the Kur lxvi. 3. (TA.) And اَسْرَرْتُ اـِلَيْهِ المَوَدَّةَ, and بِالمَوَدَّةِ, <i>I showed,</i> or <i>manifested, to him love, or affection.</i> (S.) It is said in the Kur [lx. 1], تُسِرُّونَ اـِلَيْهِمْ بِاْلْمَوَدَّةِ, meaning, <i>Ye reveal to them</i> the news of the Prophet <i>by reason of</i> the <i>love</i> that is between you and them; the objective complement of the verb being suppressed: or المودّة may be an objective complement, the ب being a redundant corroborative, as in اَخَذَ الخِطَامَ and اَخَذَ بِهِ: (Msb:) and this interpretation is correct; for اـِسْرَارٌ to a person necessarily implies revealing a secret to him and at the same time concealing it from another. (B.) ―         -b2-  وَاَسَرُّوهُ بِضَاعَةً, in the Kur xii. 19, signifies <i>And they concealed,</i> or <i>kept secret, his case,</i> making him <i>as an article of merchandise:</i> (Jel:) or <i>they conjectured in their minds that they should obtain, by selling him, merchandise.</i> (TA.) [See also an ex. voce اِرْتَغَى, in art. رغو.] ―         -b3-  اسرّ الفَاتِحَةَ, and بِالفَاتِحَةِ, <i>He recited the Fátihah</i> [or First Chapter of the Kur-án] <i>secretly,</i> or <i>inaudibly:</i> (Msb:) or the latter form of expression is a mistake. (Mgh.) ―         -b4-  اَسْرَرْتُهُ also signifies نَسَبْتُهُ اـِلَى السِّرِّ [which may mean either <i>I attributed it to secrecy,</i> or, like many phrases of this kind, by inversion, <i>I attributed to him secrecy, or mystery</i>].

      اِسْتَسَرَّيْتُهَا, (TA,) <i>I took to myself a girl,</i> or <i>young woman, as a concubine-slave.</i> (S, * TA.) تَسَرَّرْتُهَا is [said to be] thus changed to تَسَرَّيْتُهَا, (T, S, Msb,) for alleviation of the pronunciation, (Msb,) on account of the three ر s following one another, (T,) being like تَظَنَّنْتُ and تَظَنَّيْتُ. (T, * S.) Lth says that تسرّيت is a mistake; but Az says that it is correct. (TA.) ↓ <br>\
      اِسْتَسَرَّنِى occurs in a trad. as signifying <i>He took me to himself as a concubine-slave;</i> but by rule one should say تَسَرَّرَنِى, or تَسَرَّانِى: as to ↓ <br>\
      استسرّنى, it [more properly] signifies “ He revealed to me his secret. ” (TA.) ―         -b2-  تَسَرَّرَ فُلَانٌ بِنْتَ فُلَانٍ [as though signifying <i>Such a one took to himself the daughter of such a one as a concubine-slave</i>] is said when a man of low birth takes as his wife a woman or girl of high birth because of the abundance of his property and the littleness of hers.
