      سِتَّ, (Lth, T, S, M, K,) the former masc. and the latter fem., (S,) [signifying <i>Six,</i>] are originally سِدْسَةٌ (Lth, T, M) and سِدْسٌ; (Lth, T, S, M, K;) the latter س is changed into ت, and the د is incorporated into it; (Lth, T, S, M, K;) for the dim, of سِتَّةٌ is سُدَيْسَةٌ [and that of سِتٌّ is سُدَيْسٌ], and the pl. is اَسْدَاسٌ. (Lth, T, S.) You say, عِنْدِى سِتَّةُ رِجَالٍ <br>\
                  وَ نِسْوَةٍ [<i>I have with me,</i> or <i>at my abode, six men and women</i>], i. e., <i>three men and three women:</i> and you may say, عِنْدِى سِتَّةُ رِجَالٍ وَ نِسْوَةٌ, meaning, <i>six men, and also women:</i> and in like manner you do in the ease of any number that can be divided so as to apply to two plurals, as six and seven and the higher numbers: but in the case of a number that cannot be divided so as to apply to two plurals, as five and four and three, you put the latter noun in the nom. case only, saying, for ex., عِنْدِى خَمْسَةُ رِجَالٍ وَ نِسْوَةٌ. (ISk, S.) [Respecting a peculiar pronunciation of the people of El-Hijáz, and a case in which سِتَّة is imperfectly decl., see ثَلَاثَةٌ and تِسْعَةً.] ―         -b2-  سِتَّةَ عَشَرَ [indecl. in every case, meaning <i>Sixteen,</i>] is pronounced by some of the Arabs سِتَّةَ عْشَرَ: and [the fem.] سِتَّ عَشْرَةَ, thus in the dial. of El-Hijáz [and of most of the Arabs], is pronounced سِتَّ <br>\
                  عَشِرَةَ in the dial of Nejd. (S in art. عشر.) ―         -b3-  سِتُّمِايَةٍ [meaning <i>Six hundred</i>] should be written thus, without separating the two words; because سِتٌّ is originally سِدْسٌ and the union of the two words is to compensate for the incorporation of the د into the ت.
