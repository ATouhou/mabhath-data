                  , a quinqueliteral-radical word, (M,) <i>Easy</i> [<i>as a beverage</i>] <i>in the utmost degree:</i> (TA:) [applied as an epithet to milk, (لَبَن, so in a copy of the M, and so in the CK,) or signifying <i>smooth,</i> (لَيِّن, so in copies of the K,)] <i>in which is no roughness:</i> (M, K:) and sometimes applied as an epithet to water, (M, TA,) or beverage, meaning <i>easy of entrance into the throat,</i> or <i>fauces.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  And <i>Wine:</i> (K:) so accord. to some, as in the saying of &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-Rawáhah, in which it is [said to be] used as a syn. adjunct to the preceding word: <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        اـِنَّهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ فِى جِنَان ٍ<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        يَشْرَبُونَ الرَّحِيقَ وَالسَّلْسَبِيلَا<br>\
                  </quote> [as though meaning <i>Verily they are with their Lord, in gardens, drinking wine and fermented juice of the grape:</i> but the meaning may be, <i>the choicest of wine,</i> or <i>the sweetest thereof,</i> &amp;amp;c., (see رَحِيقٌ,) <i>and wine easy to swallow,</i> or <i>the like</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b3-  And <i>A certain fountain in Paradise</i> [mentioned in art. سبل, q. v.]: (M, K:) Aboo-Bekr says that it may be a proper name of the fountain, and properly imperfectly decl. [i. e. without tenween] as being determinate and of the fem. gender, but made to be with tenween at the end of a verse in the Kur [lxxvi. 18] in order that it may be conformable with other endings of verses; or it may be an epithet applied to the fountain, and therefore perfectly decl.: (TA:) Sb mentions it as an ex. of an epithet: IAar says that he had not heard it except in the Kur-án: (M, TA:) I&#39;Ab says that سَلْسَبِيلًا [in the Kur] means <i>that slips,</i> or <i>steals,</i> (يَنْسَلُّ,) <i>into the throats,</i> or <i>fauces:</i> [as though the radical letters were only س and ل, which some assert to be the case:] accord. to Aboo-Jaafar El-Bákir, it means <i>soft in the part between the</i> <br>\
                  حَنْجَرَة [or <i>head of the windpipe</i>] <i>and the</i> <br>\
                  حَلْق [or <i>fauces</i>]: the explanation as meaning [سَلْ سَبِيلًا i. e.] سَلْ رَبَّكَ سَبِيلًا اـِلَى هٰذِهِ <br>\
                  العَيْنِ [<i>Ask of thy Lord a way of access to this fountain</i>] is a mistake, not allowable. (TA.) ―         -b4-  The pl. is سَلَاسِبُ and سَلَاسِيبُ: and the pl. of [the fem.] سَلْسَبِيلَةٌ is سَلْسَبِيلَاتٌ. (TA.) ―         -b5-  [In the present day it is applied to <i>An artificial fountain that throws up water.</i>]   </entryFree> <br>\
