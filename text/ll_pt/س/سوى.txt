                  , (S, M, &amp;amp;c.,) inf. n. تَسْوِيَةٌ, (K,) <i>He made it equal, equable, uniform, even, level, flat, plane</i> or <i>plain;</i> (S, * M, MA, Msb, K;) or <i>equal in respect of elevation</i> or <i>of depression;</i> (Er-Rághib, TA;) [and <i>straight, right, direct,</i> or <i>rightly directed;</i> (see its quasi-pass. 8;)] and ↓ <br>\
      اسواهُ signifies the same; (M, K;) namely, a place, (Msb, K,) or a thing, (S, M, Er-Rághib, TA,) or an uneven, or a crooked, thing. (Mgh.) It is said in a trad., فَاَمَرَ بِالخِرَبِ فَسُوِّيَتْ [<i>And he gave orders respecting the ruins, and they were levelled</i>]. (TA in art. خرب.) And in another trad., سَوَّيْنَا عَلَى رُقَيَّةَ, meaning <i>We buried Ru- keiyeh, and made the earth of the grave even,</i> or <i>level, over her.</i> (Mgh.) [Hence also,] سُوِّيتْ <br>\
                  عَلَيْهِ الاَرْضُ: see 8. And hence the saying in the Kur [iv. 45], لُوْ تُسَوَّى بِهِمُ اْلْاَرْضُ, (TA,) i. e. <i>That they were buried, and that the ground were made level over them;</i> (S, * Bd;) بِ being here syn. with عَلَى: (TA in art. ب:) or the meaning is, <i>that they became like the dust of the earth;</i> (M, Jel;) thus expl. by Th; (M;) or <i>that they had not been created, and that they and the earth were alike.</i> (Bd.) [Hence also,] بَلَى قَادِرِينَ <br>\
                  عَلَى اَنْ نُسَوِّىَ بَنَانَهُ, in the same [lxxv. 4], is said to mean [<i>Yea: we are able</i>] <i>to make his hand like the foot of the camel, without fingers:</i> or <i>to make his fingers uniform, of one measure</i> or <i>size:</i> (TA:) or the meaning is, <i>we are able to put together the bones of his fingers</i> [<i>consistently</i>] <i>as they were.</i> (Bd, Jel.) And بَيْنَ ↓ <br>\
      حَتَّى اـِذَا سَاوَى <br>\
                  اْلصَّدَفَيْنِ, in the Kur [xviii. 95], means سَوَّى <br>\
                  بَيْنَهُمَا [i. e. <i>Until, when he had made the space between the two sides of the mountains even,</i> or <i>level,</i> by filling it up]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  [Also <i>He made it uniform, equal,</i> or <i>consimilar,</i> with another thing.] One says, سَوَّيْتُهُ بِهِ, (M, K,) inf. n. as above; (K;) and به ↓ <br>\
      سَاوَيْتُهُ, (M, * TA, TK,) and به ↓ <br>\

      سَاوَيْتُ, (S, M, K,) <i>I made them uniform,</i> or <i>equal, each with the other;</i> or <i>like each other.</i> (M, K, TA.) ―         -b3-  [And <i>He made it symmetrical</i> or <i>symmetrically, by,</i> or <i>with, a just adaptation of its component parts; made it congruous</i> or <i>consistent in its several parts,</i> or <i>with congruity</i> or <i>consistency in its several parts: he made it, formed it,</i> or <i>fashioned</i> <br>\

And سَوَّى in the same, lxxxvii. 2, <i>He made</i> what He created <i>congruous</i> or <i>consistent in the several parts.</i> (Jel.) And اْلَّذِى خَلَقَكَ فَسَوَّاكَ, in the same [lxxxii. 7], means [<i>Who created thee,</i>] <i>and made thy creation to be adapted to the exigencies,</i> or <i>requirements, of wisdom.</i> (TA.) وَنَفْسٍ وَمَا <br>\
                  سَوَّاهَا, in the same, [xci. 7, means <i>By a soul and what made it to be adapted to its exigencies,</i> i. e., to the performance of its functions, for it] is indicative of the faculties of the soul: this explanation is more proper than that which makes ما to mean [<i>Him who,</i> i. e.] God. (TA.) And رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا, in the same, lxxix. 28, means <i>He hath raised high</i> [<i>its canopy,</i> or] <i>the measure of its elevation from the earth,</i> or <i>its thickness upwards, and made it symmetrical,</i> or <i>even,</i> (Bd,) or <i>completed it by adorning it with the stars,</i> (Bd, TA, *) agreeably with what is said in the Kur xxxvii. 6, (TA,) <i>and by means of the revolvings</i> [<i>thereof</i>], <i>&amp;amp;c.:</i> from the saying next following.

      مُسَاوٍ [<i>This garment,</i> or <i>piece of cloth, is equivalent to that dirhem</i>]: and sometimes it means <i>in mode,</i> or <i>manner of being:</i> one says, لِذٰلِكَ السَّوَادِ ↓ <br>\
      هٰذَا السَّوَادُ [<i>This blackness is equal in quality to this blackness</i>]. Er-Rághib, TA.) It is said in a trad., سَاوَى الظِّلُّ <br>\
                  التِّلَالَ <br>\
                  <i>The shade,</i> or <i>shadow, was like, in its extent, to the mounds, in their height.</i> (TA.) [And ساوى الشَّىْءُ رَاْسَهُ means <i>The thing equalled in height his head:</i> see an ex. of the verb tropically used in this sense voce سِىٌّ.] One says also, هٰذَا <br>\
                  يُسَاوِى دِرْهَمًا <br>\
                  <i>This is worth,</i> or <i>equal in its value to, a dirhem:</i> and in a rare dial., one says, دِرْهَمًا ↓ <br>\
      سَوِىَ, aor. يَسْوَاهُ; (Msb, TA;) which AZ disallows, saying, one says ساواه, but not يَسْوَاهُ. (Msb.) And هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ لَا يُسَاوِى كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>This thing is not equivalent to</i> [or <i>is not worth</i>] <i>such a thing:</i> (Fr, S:) or لَايُسَاوِى شَيْيًا [<i>It</i> (a garment, or some other thing, M) <i>is not worth anything</i>]: (M, K:) ↓ <br>\
      لا يَسْوَى is of a rare dial., (K,) unknown to Fr, (S,) disallowed by A&#39;Obeyd, but mentioned by others: (M:) Az says that it is not of the language of the Arabs [of pure speech], (Msb, TA,) but is post-classical; and in like manner ↓ <br>\
      لا يُسْوِى is not correct Arabic: this last is with damm to the [first] ى: MF says that the generality of authorities disallow it, and the Fs expressly disallows it, but the expositors thereof say that it is correct and chaste, of the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, though an instance of a verb of which the aor. only is used. (TA.) One says likewise, ساوى الرَّجُلُ قِرْنَهُ <br>\
                  <i>The man equalled his opponent,</i> or <i>competitor,</i> in knowledge, or in courage. (TA.) ―         -b2-  See also 6.       -A2-  And see 2, in four places, in the former half of the paragraph.    </entryFree> <br>\

                   as a trans. verb: see 2, in two places, in the former half of the paragraph. ―         -b2-  لَايُسْوِى in the sense of لَايُسَاوِى is not correct Arabic: see 3, in the latter part of the paragraph.       -A2-  As an intrans. verb: see 8. ―         -b2-  Also <i>He was like his son,</i> or <i>offspring,</i> [in some copies of the K <i>his father,</i> which, as is said in the TA, is a mistake,] <i>in make,</i> (M, K,) or <i>in symmetry,</i> or <i>justness of proportion;</i> (Fr, TA;) or simply <i>he was like his son,</i> or <i>offspring.</i> (M.) [In this instance, and in all the senses here following that are mentioned in the K, the verb is erroneously written in the CK استوى.] ―         -b3-  اسوى فِى المَرْاَةِ <br>\
                  <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  اَوْعَبَ, (M, K, TA,) i. e. <i>He inserted the whole of his</i> <br>\

(TA.)       -A3-  Also, [as though originally اَسْوَاَ,] <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, base, abased, object, vile, despicable,</i> or <i>ignominious;</i> syn. خَزِىَ; (M, K;) from السَّوْاَةُ. (TA.) ―         -b2-  And <i>He voided his ordure;</i> syn. اَحْدَثَ; (Az, M, K;) [likewise] from السَّوْاَةُ, as meaning “ the anus. ” (Az, TA.) ―         -b3-  And hence, in the opinion of Az, and thought by J to be originally اَسْوَاَ [as he says in the S], (TA,) [though trans.,] <i>He dropped, left out, omitted,</i> or <i>neglected,</i> (S, M, K,) and <i>did so through inadvertence,</i> (S, K,) a thing, (S,) or a letter, or word, of the Kur-án, (M, K,) or a verse thereof: (M:) mentioned by A&#39;Obeyd: (S:) and in like manner, accord. to IAth, in reckoning, and in shooting, or casting: and Hr says that اَشْوَى, with ش, is allowable, as meaning اَسْقَطَ. (TA.) ―         -b4-  Also <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, affected with</i> <br>\
                  بَرَص [or <i>leprosy,</i> which is sometimes termed السُّوْءُ; so that the verb in this sense also seems to be originally اَسْوَاَ]. (TA.) ―         -b5-  And <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, restored to health,</i> [or <i>free from</i> <br>\
                  سُوْءٌ as meaning <i>an evil affection,</i> (as though the verb were in this sense likewise originally اَسْوَاَ, the incipient ا being privative, as it is in many other instances, like the Greek privative        <br>\

      لَا يَسْتَوُونَ [<i>They will not be equal,</i> or <i>alike, in the sight of God</i>]. (TA.) And one says, تَسَاوَوْا فِى المَالِ <br>\

      مَنْ سَاوَى <br>\
                  يَوْمَاهُ فَهُوَ مَغْبُونٌ, in which the meaning is said to be تَسَاوَى [i. e. <i>He whose two days are alike,</i> neither being distinguished above the other by any good done by him, <i>is weak-minded</i>]. (TA.) And in another it is said, لَا يَزَالُ النَّاسُ بِخَيْرٍ مَا <br>\
                  تَفَاضَلُوا فَاـِذَا تَسَاوَوْا هَلَكُوا, (S, * TA,) i. e. [<i>Men will not cease to be in a good state while they vie in excellence,</i>] <i>but when they cease from vying in excellent qualities and are content with defect</i> [<i>and thus become alike, they perish</i>]: or <i>when they become equal in ignorance:</i> or <i>when they form themselves into parties and divisions, and every one is alone in his opinion, and they do not agree to acknowledge one exemplar</i> or <i>chief</i> or <i>leader</i> [<i>so that they are all alike</i>]: or, accord. to Az, <i>when they are alike in evil, there being none among them possessed of good.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   [seems, accord. to Bd, to signify primarily <i>He sought,</i> or <i>desired, what was equal, equable, uniform, even,</i> or the like: for he says (in ii. 27) that the primary meaning of الاِسْتِوَا=ءُ is طلَبُ السَّوَا=ءِ; app. indicating the sense in which السوا=ء is here used by what follows. ―         -b2-  And hence, accord. to him, but I would rather say primarily, as being quasi-pass. of سَوَّاهُ,] <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, equal, equable, uniform, even, level, flat, plane</i> or <i>plain,</i> [or <i>equal in respect of elevation</i> or <i>of depression,</i> (see 2, first sentence,)] <i>straight, right, direct,</i> or <i>rightly directed;</i> syn. اِعْتَدَلَ (S, M, Msb, K, TA, and Ksh and Bd in ii. 27) فِى ذَاتِهِ, (TA,) said of a place, (Msb,) and اِسْتَقَامَ, said of a stick, or piece of wood, &amp;amp;c.

                  <i>He,</i> or <i>it, went towards him,</i> or <i>it, with an undeviating, a direct,</i> or <i>a straight, course, like the arrow hot forth:</i> and hence, ثُمَّ اْسْتَوَى اـِلَى السَّمَا=ءِ is metaphorically said of God, in the Kur ii. 27 [and xli. 10]; (Ksh;) meaning (tropical:)  Then <i>He directed himself by his will to the</i> [<i>heaven,</i> or] <i>elevated regions,</i> (Ksh, Bd,) or <i>upwards,</i> (Ksh,) or <i>to the heavenly bodies;</i> (Bd;) syn. عَمَدَ, (Zj, M, K,) and قَصَدَ (Zj, S, M, K, and Ksh and Bd) بِاـِرَادَتِةِ; (Ksh, Bd;) for when الاِسْتِوَا=ءُ is trans. by means of اـِلَى it imports the meaning of <i>the directing of oneself,</i> or, as in this case, <i>of one&#39;s design:</i> (TA;) you say of any one who has finished a work and has directed himself to another, قَدِ اْسْتَوَى لَهُ and اـِلَيْهِ: (Har p. 631:) or the meaning here is صَعِدَ, (Zj, M, K,) or صَعِدَ اَمْرُهُ [i. e. <i>his command ascended</i>]; (M;) and this is what is intended here by صَعِدَ: (TA:) or اَقْبَلَ عَلَيْهَا [i. e. <i>He advanced to it,</i> namely, the heaven]; (Fr, Th, M, K;) like as one says, كَانَ فُلَانٌ مُقْبِلًا عَلَى فُلَانٍ ثُمَّ اْسْتَوَى عَلَىَّ <br>\
                  يُشَاتِمُنِى and اـِلَىّض also, meaning اَقْبَلَ [i. e. <i>Such a one was advancing against such a one, then he advanced against me,</i> and <i>to me, reviling me,</i> or <i>contending with me in reviling</i>]: (TA:) or it means اِسْتَوْلَى, (M, K,) as some say: (M:) J says, [in the S,] but not explaining thereby the verse above cited, that it signifies also اِسْتَوْلَى and ظَهَرَ [as meaning <i>He had,</i> or <i>gained, the mastery,</i> or <i>victory</i>]: and hence the saying of El-Akhtal, cited by him [in the S,] <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
