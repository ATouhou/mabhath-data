                   (O, K, TA) and سَاذِجٌ (TA) arabicized from [the Pers.] سَادَهْ: (O, K: [in some copies of the K سَاذَهْ:]) this is the only explanation in some of the copies of the K: (TA:) <i>Plain;</i> i. e. <i>without variegation, decoration, embellishment,</i> or <i>engraved</i> or <i>sculptured work:</i> (O, TA:) or <i>without any hair upon it:</i> or <i>of one unmixed colour:</i> this last is [said to be] the correct meaning [in many instances]; but the sheykh Welee-ed-Deen El-&#39;Irákee says, in the Expos. of the “ Sunan ” of Aboo-Dáwood, respecting a pair of boots of the Prophet, described as خُفَّانِ اَسْوَدَانِ سَاذَجَانِ or سَاذِجَانِ, that this phrase seems to mean <i>A pair of black boots of one unmixed colour;</i> the last word being used in this sense in the common conventional language; though he had not found it with this meaning in the lexicons, nor in the books of authors on the strange words occurring in traditions. (TA.) ―         -b2-  Also <i>Free from self-constraint:</i> and one <i>who knows not badness, wickedness, deceit,</i> or <i>guile; in whom is no latent rancour, malevolence, malice,</i> or <i>spite, nor cunning:</i> (O:) or <i>free in intellect;</i> and <i>easy</i> [or <i>simple</i> or <i>artless</i>] <i>in nature or disposition.</i> (TA in art. سدج.) ―         -b3-  حُجَّةٌ سَاذَجَةٌ, also written سَاذِجَةٌ, is used by authors on the scholastic theology of the Muslims as meaning <i>An argument, a plea, an allegation, an evidence,</i> or <i>a testimony, that is undecisive:</i> and sometimes the same epithet is used [in like manner] in other cases. (L.)       -A2-  In some copies of the K, it is said to be [the name of] <i>Certain roots and shoots, that grow in waters, useful for such and such things;</i> arabicized from ساذه [or سَادَهْ]: (TA:) or <i>certain leaves and shoots,</i> (O, CK,) <i>used as a medicine, having a flower; one sort thereof called</i> <br>\
                  رُومِىٌّ; <i>and another,</i> <br>\
                  هِنْدِىٌّ; [the latter name, i. e. سَاذَجٌ هِنْدِىٌّ, as well as سَاذَجٌ alone, applied in the present day to <i>malabathrum,</i> or <i>Indian spikenard;</i>] <i>growing in waters that collect and stagnate in black muddy lands,</i> (O,) <i>standing up on the surface of the water,</i> (O, CK,) <i>like the plant called</i> <br>\
                  عَدَسُ المَا=ءِ, (O,) <i>without attachment to a root;</i> (O, CK;) <i>beneficial for swellings of the eye.</i> (CK.)   </entryFree> <br>\
