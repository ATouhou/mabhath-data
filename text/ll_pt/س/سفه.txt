                  سَفِيه; (S, TA;) [i. e.] <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, unwise, witless,</i> or <i>destitute of wisdom</i> or <i>understanding,</i> or [rather] <i>lightwitted.</i> (MA.) ―         -b2-  The phrase سَفِهَ نَفْسَةُ, [of which an instance occurs in the Kur ii. 124, and] to which غَبِنَ رَاْيَهُ and بَطِرَ عَيْضْلَرژَهُ and اَلِمَ بَطْنَهُ and وَفِقَ اَمْرَهُ and رَضْلَرژِدَ اَمْرَهُ are similar, was originally سَفِهَتْ <br>\
                  نَفْسُ زَيْدٍ [or rather سَفِهَتْ نَفْسُهُ i. e. <i>Himself,</i> or <i>his mind, was,</i> or <i>became, lightwitted,</i> &amp;amp;c.]; but when [the dependence of] the verb became transferred [from the نفس] to the man, what followed the verb was put in the accus. case by being its objective complement, for the phrase became identical in meaning with نَفْسَهُ ↓ <br>\
      سَفَّهَ [<i>he made himself,</i> or <i>his mind, lightwitted,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: so say the Basrees and Ks; and it is allowable with them to make this accus. to precede [the verb]; like as it is allowable to say, غُلَامَهُ ضَرَب زَيْدٌ: (S, TA:) accord. to the K, the verb thus used has three forms; (TA;) you say سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ and رَاْيَهُ, (K, TA,) and حِلْمَهُ, (TA,) and سَفُهَ, and سَفَهَ, meaning حَمَلَهُ عَلَىالسَّفَهِ [which is virtually the same as سَفَّهَهُ i. e. <i>he made himself,</i> or <i>his mind, lightwitted,</i> or <i>unwise,</i> &amp;amp;c., and in like manner <i>his judgment,</i> or <i>opinion, and he made his gravity,</i> or <i>forbearance,</i> or <i>the like, to become levity,</i> or <i>hastiness,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: or <i>he attributed</i> <br>\
                  سَفَه [i. e. <i>lightwittedness,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>to himself,</i> or <i>his mind,</i> and <i>to his judgment,</i> or <i>opinion</i>]: or <i>he destroyed it;</i> (K, TA;) agreeably with the meaning assigned to سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ by AO: (TA:) or this means <i>he held himself in mean,</i> or <i>light, estimation;</i> (MA, and Ksh and Bd in ii. 124;) and <i>rendered himself low, base,</i> or <i>contemptible:</i> (Bd ibid.:) but Lh says that سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ, with kesr [to the ف], inf. n. سَفَهٌ and سَفَاهَةٌ and سَفَاهٌ, means حَمَلَهُ عَلَى <br>\
                  السَّفَهِ [or حَمَلَهَا], and is the approved form, and that some say سَفُهَ, which is rare: and accord. to J and others, (TA,) when they say سفه نَفْسَهُ, and رَاْيَهُ, they do not say it otherwise than with kesr [to the ف], because فَعُلَ is not trans.: (S, TA:) so that the three forms of the verb mentioned in the K require consideration: (TA:) accord. to Fr, when [the dependence of] the verb in the phrase سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ became transferred from the نفس to the possessor thereof, what followed the verb became an explicative, to indicate that the سَفَه [or lightwittedness, &amp;amp;c.,] was therein; and by rule it should be سَفِهَ زَيْدٌ نَفْسًا, for the explicative should not be otherwise than indeterminate; but it was left in its state of a prefixed noun, and put in the accus. case in the manner of an indeterminate noun as being likened thereto; [the meaning, therefore, accord. to him, is <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, lightwitted,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>as to his mind;</i>] it is not allowable, however, in his opinion, to make this accus. to precede [the verb], because the explicative may not precede; and similar to this is the phrase ضِقْتُ بِهِ ذَرْعًا, and طِبْتُ بِهِ نَفْسًا, meaning ضَاقَ ذَرْعِىبِهِ and طَابَتْ نَفْسِى بِهِ: (S, TA:) but this saying [of Fr] is disallowed by the grammarians; for they say that explicatives are indeterminate, and that determinate nouns may not be used as indeterminate: some of the grammarians say that اـِلَّامَنْ سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ in the Kur [ii. 124] means الّا من سَفِهَ فِىنَفْسِهِ [<i>but he who is lightwitted,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>in his mind</i>], i. e., who becomes سَفِيه; [the prep.] فى being suppressed [and the noun therefore put in the accus. case agreeably with a general rule]: Zj holds that the approvable saying is, that it means اـِلَّا مَنْ جَهِلَ نَفْسَهُ, i. e., <i>but he who is</i> [<i>ignorant</i> or <i>silly</i> or <i>foolish</i> or] <i>unreflecting in his mind:</i> and in like manner, سَفِهَ رَاْيَهُ means جَهِلَهُ [i. e. <i>he was ignorant,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>in his judgment,</i> or <i>opinion</i>]; and <i>his judgment,</i> or <i>opinion, was unsound, without rectitude:</i> and سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ signifies also <i>he lost himself,</i> or <i>his own soul.</i> (TA.) سَفِهَ الحَقَّ is likewise expl. as meaning الحَقَّ ↓ <br>\
      سَفَّهَ [<i>He made the truth,</i> or <i>right, to be foolishness,</i> or <i>the like</i>]; and Yoo held the one to be a dial. var. of the other, and the measure of the former verb to denote intensiveness; and accord. to this explanation one may say, سَفِهْتُ <br>\
                  زَيْدًا meaning زَيْدًا ↓ <br>\
      سَفَّهْتُ [<i>I pronounced Zeyd lightwitted,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: or the meaning is جَهِلَ الحَقَّ [<i>he ignored the truth,</i> or <i>right</i>], and <i>he did not see it to be the truth,</i> or <i>right:</i> (TA:) or <i>he regarded the truth,</i> or <i>right, as foolishness,</i> or <i>ignorance.</i> (S and TA in art. غمط.) See also 2. ―         -b3-  سَفِهَ عَلَيْهِ signifies جَهِلَ [i. e., when thus trans. by means of عَلَى, <i>He feigned ignorance to him</i>]; as also سَفُهَ, (K, TA,) and ↓ <br>\

And سَفِهَ المَا=ءَ (tropical:)  <i>He drank the water immoderately.</i> (TA.) ―         -b8-  And سَفِهْتُ and سَفَهْتُ signify ضْلَرژُغِلْتُ, (so in the CK,) in [some of] the copies of the K ضْلَرژَغَلْتُ, but the right reading is ضْلَرژُغِلْتُ [i. e. <i>I was occupied,</i> or <i>busied,</i> or <i>diverted</i> from a thing]: or, accord. to the copies of the K, تَضْلَرژَغَّلْتُ; but correctly, or ضْلَرژَغَلْتُ [i. e. <i>I occupied,</i> or <i>busied,</i> or <i>diverted</i> from a thing].

(K, TA.) In the Kur ii. 282, سَفِيهًا means, accord. to Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, <i>Ignorant of the ordinances,</i> or <i>statutes; one who does not dictate well, and knows not what dictation is;</i> for he who is ignorant in all his circumstances may not deal with another upon credit: accord. to ISd, <i>ignorant or</i> <br>\
                  صَغِير [meaning <i>under the age of puberty</i>]; not ignorant of dictating, as Lh asserts it to mean, because it is added, “ or not able to dictate, himself: ” this, says Er-Rághib, denotes سَفَه in respect of worldly matters: in the Kur lxxii. 4, سَفِيهُنَا denotes سَفَه in religion. (TA.) In the Kur iv. 4, the pl. السُّفَهَا=ء is said to mean <i>Women, and young children;</i> because they are ignorant of the proper object of expense: and I&#39;Ab is related to have said that women are termed السُّفَّهُ and السُّفَهَا=ءُ: (Lh, TA:) Az, also, says that a woman is termed سَفِيهَةٌ because of the weakness of her intellect, and because she does not manage well her property; and in like manner are termed children as long as they are not known to be characterized by maturity of intellect, and rectitude of actions, and good management of affairs.
