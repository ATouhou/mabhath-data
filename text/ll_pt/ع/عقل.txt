                   [The inf. n.] عَقْلٌ signifies The act of <i>withholding,</i> or <i>restraining;</i> syn. مَنْعٌ. (TA.) [This is app. the primary signification, or it may be from what next follows.] ―         -b2-  عَقَلَ البَعِيرَ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) aor.      <br>\

                  , (S, O, Msb,) inf. n. عَقْلٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,) <i>He bound the camel with the</i> [<i>rope called</i>] عِقَال; (Mgh;) meaning <i>he bound the camel&#39;s fore shank to his arm;</i> (K;) i. e. <i>he folded together the camel&#39;s fore shank and his arm and bound them both in the middle of the arm with the rope called</i> <br>\

      عقّلهُ; (K;) or you say, عَقَّلْتُ الاـِبِلَ, from العِقَالُ, (S, O,) inf. n. تَعْقِيلٌ, (O,) [i. e. <i>I bound the camels in the manner expl. above,</i>] this verb being with tesh-deed because of its application to a number of objects: (S, O:) and sometimes the hocks were bound with the عِقَال. (TA.) The she-camel, also, was bound with the عِقَال on the occasion of her being covered: ―         -b3-  and hence العَقْلُ is metonymically used as meaning الجِمَاعُ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  <i>The act of compressing</i> a woman]. (TA.) ―         -b4-  عَقَلْتُ <br>\
                  القَتِيلَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *) or المَقْتُولَ, (S, O,) aor. as above, (TA,) and so the inf. n., (Msb, TA,) means <i>I gave,</i> or <i>paid, the bloodwit to the heir,</i> or <i>next of kin, of the slain person:</i> (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K: *) for the camels [that constituted the bloodwit] used to be bound with the عِقَال in the yard of the abode of the heir, or next of kin, of the slain person; and in consequence of frequency of usage, the phrase became employed to mean thus when the bloodwit was given in dirhems or deenárs. (As, S, O, Msb. * [See a verse cited in the first paragraph of art. عيف.]) And [hence] one says also, عَقَلْتُ عَنْهُ, (inf. n. as above, TA,) meaning <i>I paid for him,</i> (the slayer, Mgh,) i. e., <i>in his stead,</i> (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, *) <i>the bloodwit that was obligatory upon him,</i> (S, Mgh, O, K, *) or <i>what was obligatory upon him of the bloodwit.</i> (Msb.) And عَقَلْتُ لَهُ دَمَ فُلَانٍ <br>\
                  <i>I relinquished in his favour retaliation of the blood of such a one for the bloodwit.</i> (S, O, Msb, K. *) لَا تَعْقِلُ العَاقِلَةُ <br>\

(S, O, Msb) of Esh-Shaabee, (O,) or a saying of Esh-Shaabee, (Mgh, * K,) not a trad., (K,) but the like occurs in a trad. related on the authority of I&#39;Ab, (TA,) [meaning, accord. to an expl. of the verb when trans. without a particle, mentioned above, <i>Those who are responsible for the payment of a bloodwit</i> in certain cases <i>shall not pay it for an intentional act</i> of slaying or the like, <i>nor for</i> the slaying or the like of <i>a slave,</i>] applies, accord. to Aboo-Haneefeh, to the case of a slave&#39;s committing a crime against a free person: (S, O, Msb, K: [and thus as expl. in the Mgh:]) but, (S, O, Msb, K,) accord. to Ibn-Abee-Leylà, (S, O, Msb,) it applies to the case of a free person&#39;s committing a crime against a slave; for if the meaning were as Aboo-Haneefeh says, the phrase would be لَا تَعْقِلُ العَاقِلَةُ عَنْ عَبْدٍ; (S, O, Msb, K;) and As pronounced this to be correct: (S, O, Msb: *) Akmal-ed-Deen, however, in the Exposition of the Hidáyeh, says that عَقَلْتُهُ is used in the sense of عَقَلْتُ عَنْهُ, and that the context of the trad. indicates this meaning, which MF also defends. (TA.) [See also the saying لَا اَعْقِلُ <br>\
                  الكَلْبَ الهَرَّارَ in art. هر.] ―         -b5-  عَقَلَهُ, inf. n. as above, also means <i>He set him up</i> [app. a man] <i>on one of his legs;</i> [app. from عَقَلَ البَعِيرَ;] as also عَكَلَهُ: and every عَقْل is <i>a raising.</i> (TA.) ―         -b6-  Also, [agreeably with the explanation of the inf. n. in the first sentence of this art.,] and ↓ <br>\

      اعتقل signifies the same. (TA.) And يَعْقِلُ الطَّبْعَ is said of a medicine [as meaning, in like manner, <i>It binds the bowels; is astringent</i>]. (TA in art. حمض; &amp;amp;c.) And عقل البَطْنُ [app. عُقِلَ] <i>The belly</i> [or <i>bowels</i>] <i>became bound,</i> or <i>confined;</i> syn. اِسْتَمْسَكَ. (TA.) ―         -b8-  عَقَلَ عَلَى القَوْمِ, [aor.      <br>\

(TA.) &#39;Omar, when he had deferred [collecting] the poor-rate in the year [of drought called] عَامُ الرَّمَادَةِ, sent Ibn-AbeeDhubáb, and said, اِعْقِلْ عَلَيْهِمْ عِقَالَيْنِ فَاْقْسِمْ فِيهِمْ <br>\

                  عَنْكَ and سِرْ عَنْكَ: Bekr El-Mázinee says, “ I asked AZ and As and Aboo-Málik and Akh respecting this phrase, and they all said, &#39;We know not what it is: &#39; ” (so in the S:) [but] it is a mistake, for مَا اَغْفَلَهُ; (K, TA;) and thus it is mentioned by Sb and others, with غ and ف. (TA.) نَخْلَةٌ لَا تَعْقِلُ الاـِبَارَ (tropical:)  <i>A palm-tree that will not receive fecundation</i> is a tropical phrase [perhaps from عَقَلَ meaning “ he understood ” a thing].
