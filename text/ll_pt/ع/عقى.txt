                  عِقْى; (K;) [i. e.] <i>he voided his ordure for the first time, and, after that, while he was a youngling.</i> (S.) It is said in a trad. of I&#39;Ab, that when a child once suckled by a woman voids his عِقْى, she and her children become, to him, within the prohibited degrees of marriage, because it is known thereby that the milk has entered his belly. (TA.)       -A3-  مَا اَدْرِى مِنْ اَيْنَ <br>\
                  عُقِيتَ and ↓ <br>\

                  <i>He</i> (a bird) <i>rose high in his flight.</i> (S, K.) ―         -b2-  And عَقَّتِ الدَّلْوُ <br>\
                  <i>The bucket rose</i> in the well <i>turning round.</i> (TA in art. عقو.) [See also 1, (last sentence,) in art. عق.] ―         -b3-  And عقّى <br>\
                  بِسَهْمِهِ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَعْقِيَةٌ, (K,) <i>He shot his arrow</i> [<i>up</i>] <i>into the air;</i> (S, K;) a dial. var. of عَقَّهُ [or rather of عَقَّ بِهِ]. (S.) The Hudhalee, (S,) El-Mutanakhkhil, (TA,) or Aboo-Dhu-eyb, (L in art. وضح,) says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        عَقَّوْا بِسَهْمٍ فَلمْ يَشْعُرْ بِهِ اَحَدٌ<br>\

                        ثُمَّ اْسْتَفَاوُوا وَقَالُوا حَبَّذَا الوَضَحُ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>They shot an arrow towards the sky, and no one knew of it: then they returned, and said, An excellent thing is milk</i>]; (S, TA;) meaning, “ we would rather have milk than the blood of him who killed our companion; ” preferring that camels should be given them as a compensation: (L in art. وضح:) it is related [thus] with fet-h to the doubled ق, so that its place is here; and also with damm thereto, so that its place is art. عق, in which it has been mentioned. (TA. [See a similar verse cited voce عَقَّ, and the explanation thereof, there preceding that verse.])       -A2-  And عقّاهُ, inf. n. as above, <i>He gave him to drink</i> [or <i>to swallow</i>] <i>what would cause his</i> <br>\
                  عِقْى [q. v.] <i>to pass forth,</i> (K, TA,) or <i>honey in order that it might have that effect.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>He removed it from his mouth because of its bitterness:</i> (S, K:) like as one says اَشْكَيْتُهُ meaning “ I removed him from that of which he complained, ” (S, TA,) [or “ I removed from him that of which he complained, ”] the hemzeh having a privative effect. (TA.) It is said in a prov., لَا تَكُنْ حُلْوًا <br>\
