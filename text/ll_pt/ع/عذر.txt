      اعذرهُ; (S, O, Msb, K;) <i>He excused him; freed, cleared,</i> or <i>exempted, him from blame; exculpated him:</i> (Msb:) or <i>he accepted his excuse:</i> properly, عَذَرْتُ signifies <i>I cancelled evil conduct.</i> (TA.) [See also عُذْرٌ below.] You say, عَذَرْتُهُ فِيمَا صَنَعَ (S, O, Msb) <i>I excused,</i> or <i>exculpated, him for what he did.</i> (Msb.) And in a trad. of El-Mikdád it is said, اْللّٰهُ اـِلَيْكَ ↓ <br>\
      لَقَدْ اَعْذَرَ i.e. <i>Verily God hath excused thee,</i> and exempted thee from the obligation to fight against the unbelievers; for he had become extremely fat, and unable to fight. (TA.) And you say [also], عَذَرَهُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ <br>\
                  <i>He excused him for,</i> or <i>from, the thing.</i> (MA.) [And accord. to Golius,عَذَرَهُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ, as well as فِى الشَّىْءِ: but he has not mentioned his authority: see an explanation of عَذِيرٌ, from which the former phrase was perhaps derived by him.] And عَذَرْتُهُ <br>\
                  مِنْ فُلَانٍ [<i>I excused him,</i> or <i>held him excusable, for his conduct to such a one</i>]; meaning, I did not blame him, but I blamed such a one. (S, * TA.) And مَنْ يَعْذِرُنِى مِنْهُ <br>\
                  <i>Who will excuse me,</i> or <i>make my excuse, if I requite him</i> (Msb, TA) <i>for his action,</i> (Msb,) or <i>for his evil action,</i> (TA,) <i>and will not blame me</i> (Msb, TA) <i>for it?</i> (Msb:) or <i>who will excuse me with respect to his case, and will not blame me for it?</i> (Msb.)

It is said in a trad., لَنْ يَهْلِكَ النَّاسُ حَتَّى يَعْذِرُوا <br>\

      يُعْذِرُوا, (so in other copies of the S and K, ) both of which readings are the same in meaning, (TA,) i. e. [<i>Men will not perish,</i> or <i>die,</i>] <i>until they are guilty of many crimes,</i> or <i>sins,</i> &amp;amp;c.; (S, O, Msb, K;) meaning, (accord. to A &#39;Obeyd, S, O,) <i>until they deserve punishment, so as to render excusable him who punishes them.</i> (S, A, O, TA.) And you say, مِنْ نَفْسِهِ ↓ <br>\
      اعذر, meaning <i>He placed himself within the power of another.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  And عَذَرْتُهُ <br>\
                  <i>I aided him,</i> or <i>assisted him, against an enemy.</i> (Msb.)       -A3-  عَذَرَ, inf. n. عَذْرٌ, <i>He cut,</i> or <i>cut off.</i> (TA: but only the inf. n. of the verb in this sense is there mentioned.) ―         -b2-  And [hence, probably, as is implied in a passage in the TA, (see عُذْرَةٌ,)] عَذَرَ, aor.     <br>\

                  عِذَار. (TA.) ―         -b2-  And it is said in the Tahdheeb of IKtt that عَذَرْتُ الفَرَسَ, inf. n. عَذْرٌ, signifies <i>I cauterized the horse in the place of the</i> <br>\
                  عِذَار: ―         -b3-  and also حملت على عذاره [an explanation in which there seems to be a mistranscription or an omission, or both; perhaps correctly جَعَلْتُ عَلَى <br>\

      عاذر, (K, TA,) inf. n. مُعَاذَرَةٌ: (TA:) <i>he affected to excuse himself, but had no excuse: he excused himself, but did not adduce an excuse</i> [<i>that was valid</i>]. (TA.) [See also 8.] ―         -b2-  And <i>He was remiss, wanting, deficient,</i> or <i>defective,</i> (S, O, Msb, TA,) in an affair, (S, Msb,) <i>setting up an excuse</i> [<i>for being so</i>]; (O;) <i>fell short,</i> or <i>did less than was incumbent on him,</i> (S, O, Msb, TA,) in it; (S, Msb;) <i>did not exert himself,</i> or <i>act vigorously,</i> in it; (Msb, TA;) <i>causing it to be imagined that he had an excuse when he had none.</i> (Bd in ix. 91.) You say, قَامَ فُلَانٌ قِيَامَ تَعْذِيرٍ <br>\
                  <i>Such a one acted remissly, falling short,</i> or <i>doing less than was incumbent on him.</i> (TA.) And it is said in a story of the Children of Israel, نَهَاهُمْ اَحْبَارُهُمْ تَعْذِيرًا <br>\
                  <i>Their learned men forbade them remissly:</i> the inf. n. being here put in the place of the act. part. n. as a denotative of state; as it is in جَا=ءَ مَشْيًا. (O, TA.) [See also 4.]       -A2-  Also (tropical:)  <i>He made,</i> or <i>prepared, a feast,</i> (O, K,) <i>such as is termed</i> <br>\
                  اـِعْذَار [q. v.] (O) or عِذَار: (K:) and <i>he invited to a feast such as is thus termed.</i> (K. [Accord. to the TA, these are two distinct significations of the verb.

It is held by some in the present day that the ا in اعذر, in this phrase, has a privative effect, and that the meaning is, <i>He deprives of excuse who warns:</i> but for this I have not found any authority.]) And Lebeed says, (S, O, TA,) addressing his two daughters, (O, TA,) and telling them to wail and weep a year for him after his death, (TA,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\

                  <i>year has become excusable</i>]. (S, O.) You say also, اَعْذَرْتُ عِنْدَ السُّلْطَانِ <br>\
                  <i>I got excuse of the Sultán</i> [or <i>ruling power</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b3-  And <i>He manifested an excuse:</i> (K, TA:) in which sense, عُذْرٌ is said to be its inf. n., as well as اـِعْذَارٌ; but the former is correctly a simple subst. (TA.) And <i>He pleaded that by which he should be excused.</i> (TA.) [See also 8.] ―         -b4-  <i>He did that by which he should be excused.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  <i>He did that in which he should be excused:</i> hence the saying of Zuheyr, *سَتَمْنَعُكُمْ اَرْمَاحُنَا اَوْ سَنُعْذِرُ [<i>Our spears shall prevent you,</i> or <i>shall defend you,</i>] or <i>we will do that in which we shall be excused.</i> (S, O: but in the latter, وَتَمْنَعُكُمْ.) ―         -b6-  And <i>He exceeded the usual bounds,</i> (A, Mgh, O,) or <i>went to the utmost point,</i> (TA,) <i>in excuse,</i> (A, Mgh, O, TA,) i. e. <i>in being excused.</i> (A.) So in the saying اَعْذَرَ مَنْ اَنْذَرَ [<i>He exceeds the usual bounds in rendering himself excused who warns</i>]. (A, Mgh, O. [See also above, third sentence.]) And it is said in a trad., لَقَدْ اَعْذَرَ اْللّٰهُ اـِلَى مَنْ <br>\
                  بَلَغَ مِنَ العُمُرِ سِتِّينَ سَنَةً [app. meaning <i>Verily God hath freed himself from the imputation of injustice to an extraordinary degree,</i> or <i>to the utmost point, to him who hath attained sixty years of age:</i>] i. e. He hath left him no plea for excuse [for his sins], since He hath granted him respite for all this length of time and he hath not excused himself. (TA. [As اعذر is here followed by اـِلَى, I do not think that this explanation is meant to show that the ا has a privative effect, and that the verb signifies “ he deprived of excuse. ”]) ―         -b7-  [Hence,] <i>He exerted himself, acted vigorously, took extraordinary pains,</i> or <i>exceeded the usual bounds,</i> [<i>so as to render himself excused,</i>] (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) فِى الاَمْرِ <br>\
                  <i>in the affair;</i> (S, O, Msb;) as, for instance, in eating, in relation to which it occurs in a trad., wherein one is enjoined to do so when eating with others, [app. meaning with guests and with a host,] such having been the custom of the Prophet; for, when he ate with others, he was the last in eating. (TA.) [Hence also,] اَعْذَرْتُ اـِلَيْكَ <br>\
                  <i>I took extraordinary pains,</i> or <i>exceeded the usual bounds, in exhortation and precept to thee.</i> (TA.) ―         -b8-  And <i>He was remiss, wanting, deficient,</i> or <i>defective; he fell short,</i> or <i>did less than was incumbent on him; feigning</i> (يُرِى [in the CK, erroneously, يُرىٰ]) that <i>he was doing the contrary:</i> as though the verb bore two contrary significations. (K.) [See also 2.]       -A2-  Also <i>I. q.</i> <br>\
                  اَنْصَفَ: (O, K:) you say, اَعْذِرْنِى مِنْ هٰذَا i. e. اَنْصِفْنِى مِنْهُ [<i>Give thou me,</i> or <i>obtain for me, my right,</i> or <i>due, from this</i> person]: and hence the saying of the Prophet to Aboo-Bekr, respecting &#39;Áïsheh, اَعْذِرْنِى مِنْهَا اـِنْ <br>\
                  اَدَّبْتُهَا [<i>Obtain thou for me my right,</i> or <i>due, from her if I discipline her,</i> or <i>chastise her</i>]: (O:) or this means <i>undertake thou to excuse me</i> [<i>for my conduct to her</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (TA:) and the Arabs say, اَعْذَرَ فُلَانٌ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ [<i>Such a one became bound to render an excuse for his conduct to himself;</i> (see عَذِيرٌ;)] meaning <i>such a one was destroyed by himself.</i> (Yoo, TA.)       -A3-  As signifying <i>He circumcised:</i> see 1, latter half. It is said in a trad., كُنَّا اـِعْذَارَ يَوْمٍ وَاحِدٍ, meaning <i>We were circumcised in one day.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  Also (tropical:)  <i>He made a feast on the occasion of a circumcision,</i> (AZ, Msb, K, TA,) لِلْقَوْمِ <br>\
                  <i>for the people,</i> or <i>party:</i> (K:) <i>he prepared such a feast:</i> from the same verb signifying “ he circumcised. ” (TA.) [See also 2: and see اـِعْذَارٌ as a subst.]       -A4-  اعذر الفَرَسَ and اللِّجَامَ: see 1, latter half, in five places. ―         -b2-  And اَعْذِرْ عَنِّى بَعِيرَكَ: see 2, near the end. ―         -b3-  اَعْذِرْ عَلَى نَصِيبِكَ <br>\

                  <i>He beat him</i> (O, K) with whips (O) <i>so as to make a mark,</i> or <i>marks, upon his back.</i> (O, K.) And ضَرَبَهُ حَتَّى اَعْذَرَ مَتْنَهُ <br>\

                   sing. of مَعَاذِيرُ, (O, K,) which signifies [<i>Excuses,</i> or <i>apologies;</i>] <i>pleas, allegations,</i> or <i>arguments:</i> (K, TA: see عُذْرٌ, in two places:) ―         -b2-  and also, (K, TA,) in the dial. of El-Yemen, (TA,) <i>Veils, curtains,</i> or <i>coverings.</i> (O, K, TA.) The saying in the Kur [lxxv. 14 and 15], بَلِ <br>\

                  <i>Excused; freed, cleared,</i> or <i>exempted, from blame; exculpated.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b2-  And [hence, perhaps,] مَعْذُورَةٌ applied to a woman signifies مُسْتَحَاضَةٌ [q. v. in art. حيض]: and sometimes one says ↓ <br>\
      عَاذِرَةٌ; as meaning <i>having an excuse:</i> (Msb:) the latter is said to be used in the sense of مُسْتَحَاضَةٌ; but it requires consideration; (O, TA;) as though it were of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ in the sense of مَفْعُولَةٌ, [i. e. in the sense of مَعْذُورَةٌ as meaning <i>excused,</i>] from اـِقَامَةُ العُذْرِ. (TA.) ―         -b3-  [Golius assigns to مَعْذُورٌ the meaning of “ <i>Voti impos;</i> ” as on the authority of the KL; in which, however, I do not find it.]       -A2-  Also (tropical:)  <i>Circumcised.</i> (S, A, O, Msb.)       -A3-  And A camel <i>branded with the mark called</i> <br>\

                   One <i>excusing himself, whether he have,</i> or <i>have not, an excuse:</i> (TA:) the person to whom this epithet is applied may be a speaker of truth, and he may be not a speaker of truth: (Msb, TA:) and so ↓ <br>\
      مُعَذِّرٌ, which, as applied to a speaker of truth, signifies <i>having an excuse,</i> like مُعْتَذِرٌ, (S, O, K,) [of which it is a variation,] for the ت is changed into ذ, and this is incorporated [into the radical ذ], and its vowel is transferred to the ع, like as is the case in يَخَصِّمُونَ; (S, O;) and ↓ <br>\
      مُعِذِّرٌ is also allowable, (S, O, TA,) and also ↓ <br>\
      مُعُذِّرٌ; (S, O;) but [it is said that] ↓ <br>\
      مُعَذِّرٌ applied to him who does not speak truth, (S, O, K,) being [originally] of the measure مُفَعِّلٌ, [not a variation of مُعْتَذِرٌ,] (S, O,) means <i>falling short,</i> or <i>doing less than is incumbent on him,</i> (S, O, K,) <i>excusing himself</i> (S, O) <i>without having any</i> [<i>real</i> or <i>valid</i>] <i>excuse.</i> (S, O, K.) In the Kur ix. 91, I&#39;Ab read ↓ <br>\
      المُعْذِرُونَ [instead of the more usual reading ↓ <br>\
      المُعَذِّرُونَ], (S, O, K,) and so did Yaakoob El-Hadramee, (Az, TA,) from اَعْذَرَ; the former asserting that it was so revealed; app. considering ↓ <br>\
      مُعَذِّرٌ, with teshdeed, to apply to one not speaking truth, (S, O, K,) meaning <i>pretending to excuse himself, without having any real excuse;</i> (S, O;) and ↓ <br>\
      مُعْذِرٌ to mean <i>having an excuse:</i> (S, O, K:) Ibn-Abee-Leylà and Tá-oos read ↓ <br>\
      المُعَاذِرُونَ, as meaning <i>those striving,</i> or <i>labouring, in seeking excuse.</i> (O.)   </entryFree> <br>\
