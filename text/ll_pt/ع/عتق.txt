The meaning of The <i>state,</i> or <i>act, of preceding,</i> or <i>having precedence,</i> [assigned to the inf. n. عِتْقٌ,] is said to be the turning-point of the art.: and hence, عَتَقَ الخَيْلَ, said of a horse, means <i>He preceded the</i> other <i>horses, and became safe,</i> or <i>secure, from them.</i> (Mgh.)

(S, O, Msb.) العَتِيقُ is an appellation applied to Es-Siddeek, (S, K,) i. e. (S) to Aboo-Bekr, (S, O, K,) as a surname, (K,) because he was said by the Prophet to be freed (عَتِيق) from the fire [of Hell]: or because of his beauty, or comeliness: (S, O, K:) or he was so named by his mother.

(Mgh.) البَيْتُ العَتِيقُ is an appellation of <i>The Kaabeh,</i> (S, O, K,) given to it in the Kur-án [xxii. 30 and 34, as meaning <i>the Old House</i>], (O,) because it was the first house founded upon the earth, (O, K,) as is said in the Kur [iii. 90]: (O:) or [as meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>the Freed House,</i>] because it was freed from submersion (O, K) in the days of the Deluge, (O,) being taken up; (TA;) or from the imperious, overbearing, or tyrannical, of mankind; or from the Abyssinians; or because not possessed by any one; (O, K;) and [thus expl.] it is tropical.
