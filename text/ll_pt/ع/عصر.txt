      اعتصرهُ; (S, O, Msb, K;) [<i>He pressed it,</i> or <i>squeezed it, so as to force out,</i> i. e. <i>he expressed, its juice, sirup, honey, oil, water,</i> or <i>moisture;</i>] <i>he extracted,</i> or <i>fetched out by labour</i> or <i>art</i> [i. e. <i>by pressure</i> or <i>wringing</i>], (Msb, K,) <i>its water,</i> or <i>juice,</i> or <i>the like,</i> (Msb,) or <i>what was in it,</i> (K,) namely, what was in grapes, (S, Msb, K,) and the like, (Msb, K,) of things having oil, or sirup, or honey: (TA:) or عَصَرَهُ signifies <i>he performed that act himself;</i> (K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      عصّرهُ, inf. n. تَعْصِيرٌ: (Sgh, TA:) or the latter, <i>he superintended the pressing thereof,</i> i. e., of grapes: (O:) and ↓ <br>\
      اعتصرهُ, <i>he had it done for him:</i> (K:) or this last, <i>he did it for another,</i> or <i>others:</i> (Mgh, as implied by an explanation of مُعْتَصِرٌ:) and عَصِيرًا ↓ <br>\
      اعتصر <br>\
                  <i>he prepared expressed juice or the like.</i> (S, O.) [See also 8 below.] عُصْرَ is used as a contraction of عُصِرَ. (S, O.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] عَصَرَ الثَّوْبَ, inf. n. as above, <i>He wrung out the water of the garment,</i> or <i>piece of cloth; he forced out its water by wringing it.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b3-  And عَصَرَ الدُّمَّلَ لِتَخْرُجَ <br>\
                  مِدَّتُهُ [<i>He squeezed,</i> or <i>pressed, the pustule in order that its thick purulent matter might come forth</i>]. (Msb.) ―         -b4-  And عَصَرَ حَلْقَهُ [<i>He squeezed his throat</i>]. (Mgh and Msb in art. خنق.) ―         -b5-  And عَصَرَ, aor.      <br>\
                     عَصِرَ<br>\
                  , (assumed tropical:)  <i>He took,</i> or <i>collected, the produce of the earth:</i> from the same verb in the first of the senses expl. above: and hence, accord. to Abu-l-Ghowth, in the Kur [xii. 49], وَفَيهِ يَعْصِرُونَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>And in it they shall take,</i> or <i>collect, the produce of the earth:</i> (S:) or the meaning is, <i>and in it they shall press grapes,</i> or <i>olives,</i> or <i>the like:</i> or <i>they shall milk the udders.</i> (Bd.) [And there are other explanations, which see below.]       -A2-  عُصِرُوا, (S, IKtt, O,) or ↓ <br>\
      اُعْصِرُوا, (O, K,) <i>They were rained upon; they had rain;</i> syn. مُطِرُوا, (S, O,) or اُمْطِرُوا [which is less correct]. (IKtt, K.) Hence, in the Kur [ubi suprà], accord. to one reading, وَفِيهِ يُعْصَرُونَ [<i>And in it they shall have rain</i>]. (S, O.) [See also above, and below.]       -A3-  عَصَرَهُ also signifies <i>He saved him; preserved him:</i> and hence, in the Kur [ubi suprà], accord. to one reading, وَفِيهِ يُعْصَرُونَ [<i>And in it they shall be saved,</i> or <i>preserved</i>]. (Bd.) ―         -b2-  Hence also, perhaps, the other reading, وَفِيهِ يُعْصِرُونَ <br>\
                  <i>And in it they shall aid,</i> or <i>succour, one another.</i> (Bd.) ―         -b3-  See also 8, last quarter, in two places.       -A4-  Also, عَصَرَهُ, (O, TA,) inf. n. عَصْرٌ, (O, K, TA,) <i>It</i> [or <i>he</i>] <i>withheld, hindered,</i> or <i>prevented, him:</i> (O, K, * TA:) one says, مَا عَصَرَكَ <br>\
                  <i>What withheld, hindered,</i> or <i>prevented, thee?</i> (O, TA.) And <i>He refused,</i> and <i>withheld, it;</i> (K, * TA;) namely, anything. (TA.) [See also 8, which signifies the same.] ―         -b2-  And عَصَرَهُ, (K,) aor.      <br>\

                  , inf. n. عَصْرٌ, <i>He gave</i> (O, K, TA) <i>to him.</i> (K, TA.) Thus it has two contr. significations. (IKtt, TA.) Tarafeh says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  وَلَدِهِ فِى مَالِهِ [(tropical:)  <i>The father may take back what he has given to his child</i>], the verb is made trans. by means of على because it implies the meaning of يَرْجِعُ عَلَيْهِ, and يَعُودُ عَلَيْهِ: (IAth, Mgh, O: *) or this latter trad. means, <i>the father may forbid his child his property, and withhold it from him:</i> (S:) and [in like manner] the former trad., <i>the father may withhold his child from giving his property, and forbid it to him:</i> (TA:) for اعتصر also signifies <i>he prevented, hindered, withheld,</i> or <i>refused;</i> syn. مَنَعَ.

      وَفِيهِ تُعْصَرُونَ [sic], which is one reading, is expl. by Lth as signifying <i>And in it ye shall have recourse for refuge,</i> or <i>protection;</i> but Az disapproves of this: (TA:) [the common reading] وفيه يَعْصِرُونَ, accord. to AO, (so in one copy of the S,) or A&#39;Obeyd, (as in another copy of the S,) signifies <i>and in it they shall be safe;</i> from عُصْرَةٌ signifying “ a cause, or means, of safety: ” (S:) or <i>they shall be safe from trial,</i> or <i>affliction, and shall preserve themselves by plenty,</i> or <i>fruitfulness.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
