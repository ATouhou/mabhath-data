                  <i>He shot the arrow towards the sky;</i> and that arrow was called عَقِيقَةٌ; (S, O, K;) and it was the arrow of self-excuse: they used to do thus in the Time of Ignorance [on the occasion of a demand for blood-revenge]; and if the arrow returned smeared with blood, they were not content save with the retaliation of slaughter; but if it returned clean, they stroked their beards, and made reconciliation on the condition of the bloodwit; the stroking of the beards being a sign of reconciliation: the arrow, however, as IAar says, did not [ever] return otherwise than clean: (S, O:) the origin was this: a man of the tribe was slain, and the slayer was prosecuted for his blood; whereupon a company of the chief men [of the family of the slayer] collected themselves together to the heirs [who claimed satisfaction for the blood] of the slain, and offered the bloodwit, asking forgiveness for the blood; and if the heir [who claimed satisfaction and who acted for himself and his coheirs] was a strong man, impatient of injury, he refused to take the bloodwit; but if weak, he consulted the people of his tribe, and then said to the petitioners, “ We have, between us and our Creator, a sign denoting command and prohibition: we take an arrow, and set it on a bow, and shoot it towards the sky; and if it return to us smeared with blood, we are forbidden to take the bloodwit, and are not content save with the retaliation of slaughter; but if it return clean, as it went up, we are commanded to take the bloodwit: ” so they made reconciliation; for this arrow never returned otherwise than clean; and thus they had an excuse in the opinion of the ignorant of them. (L, TA.) A poet (S, O, TA) of the family of the slain, said by some to be of Hudheyl, by IB to be El-As&#39;ar El-Joafee, who was absent from this reconciliation, (TA,) says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

And عَقَّ الرَّحِمَ, (TA, and Ham p. 93,) like قَطَعَهَا [i. e. <i>He severed the tie,</i> or <i>ties, of relationship, by unkind behaviour to his kindred</i>]. (Ham ib.) And عَقَّ [alone], aor.      <br>\

                  الوَالِدَيْنِ [<i>Undutiful treatment,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>of the two parents</i>] is said in a trad. to be one of the great sins. (O.) And it is said in a prov., العُقُوقُ <br>\
                  اَحَدُ الثُّكْلَيْنِ [<i>Undutiful treatment of a parent is one of the two sorts of being bereft of a child</i>]: or, as some relate it, العُقُوقُ ثُكْلُ مَنْ لَمْ يَثْكَلْ [<i>Undutiful treatment of a parent is</i> (like) <i>the bereavement of him who is not</i> (really) <i>bereft of his child</i>]: i. e. he whom his children have treated undutifully (مِنْ عَقَّهُ وَلَدُهُ) is as though he were bereft of his children although they are living.

                  الوَالِدَيْنِ, the verb is metaphorically used in the saying, in a trad., مَثَلُكُمْ وَمَثَلُ عَايِشَةَ مَثَلُ العَيْنِ <br>\

      عَقَّقَت, the third ق being changed into ى, [which is then in this case suppressed,] like as they said تَظَنَّيْتُ from الظَّنُّ: [it is, however, mentioned in the TA in art. عقو also, and there expl. as meaning <i>it rose</i> in the well <i>turning round:</i> and from what here follows, it appears to mean <i>it rose swiftly, cleaving the air:</i>] a poet, cited by IAar, says, of a bucket,  <br>\
