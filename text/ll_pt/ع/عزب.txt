Th], and عَزَبٌ is used as an epithet of a man and of a woman, like as is خَصْمٌ, and does not assume a dual form nor a pl. nor a fem. form, because it is originally an inf. n.; MF, however, denies that we have any authority for calling عَزَبٌ an inf. n.: he considers it to be a simple epithet, like حَسَنٌ &amp;amp;c.; and if used in the fem. sense without the termination ة otherwise than by poetic license, to be an anomalous epithet, like عَانِسٌ, which is applied alike to a man and to a woman: the phrase رَجُلَانِ عَزَبَانِ is also mentioned: and the saying اـِنَّهُ لَعَزَبٌ لَزَبٌ [in which the latter epithet is merely an imitative sequent corrobative of the former], and اـِنَّهَا لَعَزَبَةٌ لَزَبَةٌ: and عَزَبٌ is said to be [also] a quasi-pl. n.

                   A man <i>who goes away to a distance with his cattle,</i> or <i>camels</i> &amp;amp;c., (S, A, O, K,) <i>from others, in the pasturage;</i> (S, O;) as also ↓ <br>\
      مِعْزَابٌ: (A, O, K:) accord. to Az, the former is the only epithet of the measure مِفْعَالَةٌ, except مِجْذَامَةٌ, which is sometimes used; [but in the TA, مِطْرَابَةٌ and مِطْوَاعَةٌ and مِقْدَامَةٌ also are mentioned;] the ة in معزابة, he says, is added to give intensiveness to the signification, and to imply praise; the meaning being, in his opinion, a man <i>who frequently betakes himself, with his cattle,</i> or <i>camels &amp;amp;c., pasturing at a distance from others, to the places where rain has fallen, and to the uncropped herbage produced thereby;</i> and he adds that the ة is affixed to a masc. epithet to imply praise or blame when intensiveness is meant. (TA.) The two epithets above are also expl. as applied to a man <i>who pastures his camels at a distance from the abode of the tribe, not repairing to them to rest.</i> (TA.)
