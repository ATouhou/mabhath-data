                     عَرِفَ<br>\
                  , (O, K,) inf. n. مَعْرِفَةٌ (S, O, K) and عِرْفَانٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and عِرِفَّانٌ (K) and عِرْفَةٌ, (Msb, K,) or مَعْرِفَةٌ is a simple subst., (Msb,) <i>He knew it; he had cognition of it;</i> or <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, acquainted with it;</i> syn. عَلِمَهُ: (K:) or <i>he knew it</i> (عَلِمَهُ) <i>by means of any of the five senses;</i> (Msb;) [and also, <i>by mental perception:</i>] Er-Rághib says, المَعْرِفَةُ is <i>the perceiving</i> a thing <i>by reflection,</i> and <i>by consideration of the effect</i> thereof [<i>upon the mind</i> or <i>sense</i>], so that it has a more special meaning than العِلْمُ, and its contr. is الاـِنْكَارُ; and one says, فُلَانٌ <br>\
                  يَعْرِفُ اْللّٰهَ وَرَسُولَهُ [<i>Such a one knows God and his apostle</i>], but one does not say يَعْلَمُ اْللّٰهَ, making the verb [thus] to have a single objective complement, since man&#39;s مَعْرِفَة [or knowledge] of God is [the result of] the consideration of his effects, without the perception of his essence; and one says, اَللّٰهُ يَعْلَمُ كَذَا, but not يَعْرِفُ كذا, since المَعْرِفَةُ is used in relation to عِلْم [or knowledge] which is defective, to which one attains by reflection: it is from عَرَفْتُهُ meaning <i>I found,</i> or <i>experienced, its</i> <br>\
                  عَرْف i. e. <i>odour;</i> or as meaning <i>I attained its</i> <br>\
                  عُرْف i. e. <i>limit:</i> (TA:) it is said in the B that المَعْرِفَةُ differs from العِلْمُ, in meaning, in several ways: the former concerns the thing itself [which is its object;] whereas the latter concerns the states, or conditions, or qualities, thereof: also the former generally denotes <i>the perceiving</i> a thing <i>as a thing that has been absent from the mind,</i> thus differing from the latter; therefore the contr. of the former is الاـِنْكَارُ, and the contr. of the latter is الجَهْلُ; and the former is <i>the knowing</i> a thing itself <i>as distinguished from other things;</i> whereas the latter concerns a thing collectively with other things: (TA in art. علم:) and sometimes they put ↓ <br>\
      اعترف in the place of عَرَفَ; (S, O;) [i. e.] اعترف الشَّىْءَ signifies عَرَفَهُ: (Mgh, K:) and so, sometimes, does ↓ <br>\
      استعرفُه. (Har p. 486.) ―         -b2-  And عَرَفَ is also used in the place of اعترف [in the first of the senses assigned to the latter below]. (S, O.) See the latter verb, in four places. ―         -b3-  عَرَفَهُ also signifies <i>He requited him.</i> (O, K.) Ks read, (O, K,) and so five others, (Az, TA,) in the Kur [lxvi. 3], (O,) عَرَفَ <br>\
                  بَعْضَهُ, meaning <i>He requited</i> her, namely, Hafsah, <i>for part</i> [<i>thereof,</i> i. e.] of what she had done: (Fr, O, K:) and he did so indeed by divorcing her: (Fr, TA:) or it means <i>he acknowledged part thereof:</i> (K:) but others read بَعْضَهُ ↓ <br>\
      عَرَّفَ, which, likewise, has the former of the two meanings expl. above: (Bd:) or this means <i>he told</i> Hafsah <i>part thereof.</i> (Fr, O, Bd, * TA. [See also 2.]) As first expl. above, this phrase is like the saying to him who does good or who does evil, اَنَا اَعْرِفُ لاَهْلِ الاـِحْسَانِ وَاَعْرِفُ لِاَهْلِ الاـِسَا=ءَةِ, (O,) or لِلْمُحْسِنِ وَالمُسِىْءِ, (K,) [<i>I know how to requite the doer of good and the doer of evil,</i>] i. e. the case of the doer of good and that of the doer of evil are not hidden from me nor is the suitable requital of him. (O, K.) لَاَعْرِفَنَّكَهَا عَنْدَ رَسُولِ اْللّٰهِ occurs in a trad., meaning <i>I will assuredly requite thee for it in the presence of the Apostle of God so that he shall know thy evil-doing:</i> and is used in threatening.

                  <i>over the people,</i> or <i>party;</i> i. e., <i>manager,</i> or <i>orderer, of their affairs;</i> as also عَرُفْتُ عَلَيْهِمْ: (Msb:) or عَرُفَ, inf. n. عَرَاعَةٌ, signifies <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, an</i> <br>\

                  <i>during some years,</i>] like كَتَبَ, aor. يَكْتُبُ, inf. n. كِتَابَةٌ. (S, O, K. *)       -A4-  عَرَفَ لِلْاَمْرِ, aor.     <br>\
                     عَرِفَ<br>\

      اعترف, (O, K,) as some say. (O.) And عُرِفَ عِنْدَ المُصِيبَةِ <br>\
                  <i>He was patient on the occasion of the affliction,</i> or <i>misfortune.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  And عَرَفَ <br>\

                   signifies The <i>making to know;</i> syn. اـِعْلَامٌ: (S, O, K, TA:) [or rather it has a more restricted signification than the latter word, as is indicated in the preceding paragraph:] and in this sense its verb may have two objective complements: one says, عرّفهُ الاَمْرَ <br>\
                  <i>He made him to know the affair,</i> or <i>case;</i> syn. اَعْلَمَهُ اـِيَّاهُ: [or <i>he acquainted him with it;</i> or <i>told him of it:</i>] and عرّفهُ بَيْتَهُ <br>\
                  <i>He made him to know,</i> or <i>acquainted him with, the place of his house,</i> or <i>tent;</i> syn. اَعْلَمَهُ بِمَكَانِهِ: (TA:) [and] one says عَرَّفْتُهُ بِهِ, meaning <i>I made him to know it by means of any of the five senses</i> [or <i>by mental perception;</i> as also عَرَّفْتُهُ اـِيَّاهُ]. (Msb.) See also 1, former half. And see 4. ―         -b2-  Also The <i>making known; contr. of</i> <br>\
                  تَنْكِيرٌ. (O, K.) عَرَّفَ بَعْضَهُ, in the Kur [lxvi. 3], has been expl. as meaning <i>He made known part thereof.</i> (TA. [For other explanations, see 1.]) And عَرَّفْتُهُ بِزَيْدٍ means <i>I made him known by the name of Zeyd;</i> like the phrase سَمَّيْتُهُ بِزَيْدٍ. (Sb, TA.) ―         -b3-  [Hence, The <i>explaining</i> a term: and <i>an explanation</i> thereof: thus used, its pl. is تَعْرِيفَاتٌ: it has a less restricted meaning than حَدٌّ, which signifies the “ defining, ” and “ a definition. ” ―         -b4-  And The <i>making</i> a noun, or a nominal proposition, <i>determinate.</i> ―         -b5-  Hence also,] The <i>crying</i> a stray-beast, or a beast or some other thing that has been lost; (S, TA;) the <i>mentioning</i> it [<i>and describing</i> it] <i>and seeking to find him who had knowledge</i> of it.

(TA.) عَرَّفَهَا لَهُمْ, in the Kur [xlvii. 7], is said to mean <i>He hath rendered it fragrant</i> [i. e. Paradise (الجَنَّة)] <i>for them:</i> (S, O:) or it means <i>He hath described it to them so that, when they enter it, they shall know it by that description,</i> or so <i>that they shall know their places of abode therein:</i> (O:) or <i>He hath described it to them, and made them desirous of it:</i> (Er-Rághib, TA:) [and the like is said by Bd:] or <i>He hath defined it for them so that there shall be for every one a distinct paradise.</i> (Bd.) ―         -b2-  One says also, عرّف رَاْسَهُ بِالدُّهْنِ <br>\
                  <i>He moistened the hair of his head abundantly with oil,</i> or <i>with the oil;</i> syn. رَوَّاهُ. (TA.) ―         -b3-  And عرّف طَعَامَهُ <br>\

You say, عرّفوا, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,) inf. n. as above, <i>They halted at &#39;Arafát;</i> (Mgh, Msb;) or <i>they were present at &#39;Arafát;</i> (S, O.) And [hence], in a postclassical sense, <i>They imitated the people of &#39;Arafát, in some other place, by going forth to the desert and there praying, and humbling themselves,</i> or <i>offering earnest supplication;</i> (Mgh;) or <i>by assembling in their mosques to pray and to beg forgiveness:</i> (Har p. 672:) the first who did this was Ibn-&#39;Abbás, at El-Basrah.

                  <i>He excited evil,</i> or <i>mischief, between them,</i> or <i>among them:</i> the verb in this phrase being formed by permutation from اَ َّ ثَ. (Yaakoob, TA.)     <br>\
