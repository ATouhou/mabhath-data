                  , (A, * Msb, K, *) inf. n. عَكْسٌ, (S, A, O, Msb, K,) <i>He reversed it; made the last part of it to be first, and the first to be last;</i> or <i>turned it kind part before, and fore part behind.</i> (S, A, O, Msb, K.) [Hence,] عَكَسَ الكَلَامَ وَنَحْوَهُ, (A, O, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (O,) <i>He inverted, reversed, converted,</i> or <i>transposed, the language</i> or <i>sentence, and the like;</i> [as, for instance, a word;] <i>he changed its order by inversion</i> or <i>transposition:</i> (A, O, K:) sometimes a word, when this is done, remains as at first; as in the instances of بَابٌ and خَوْخٌ and عَكَوْكَعٌ: (TA:) or <i>he perverted its order</i> (TA) [or <i>its meaning:</i> see مَعْكُوسٌ]. [Hence the phrase بِاْلْعَكْسِ <br>\
                  <i>Vice versâ.</i>] One says to him who speaks wrongly, لاَ تَعْكِسْ [<i>Pervert not thou</i>]. (A.) And ↓ <br>\
      مُعَاكَسَةٌ with respect to language and the like is like عَكْسٌ. (TA.) ―         -b2-  [Hence, said of a mirror and the like, <i>It reflected it;</i> namely, an object before it; because the object seen in it is reversed.] ―         -b3-  From the first of the significations mentioned above is derived the expression [used by the Arabs in the “ Time of Ignorance ”], عَكْسُ البَلِيَّةِ عِنْدَ القَبْرِ [<i>The tying, with her head turned backwards, of the she-camel that is left to die at the grave in which her master is buried</i>]; because they used to tie her with her head turned backwards towards the part next her breast and belly, or, as some say, towards her hinder part next the back, and to leave her in that state until she died. (S, O.) And [hence, app.,] العَكْسُ also signifies <i>The confining</i> a beast (دَابَّة) <i>without fodder.</i> (TA.) You say also, عَكَسَ رَاْسَ البَعِيرِ, aor.      <br>\

                  <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  رَدَدْتُهُ عَلَيْهِ [<i>I reversed to him his affair,</i> or <i>case; I made his affair,</i> or <i>case, to become the contrary of what it was to him</i>]. (Msb.) ―         -b5-  عَكَسْتُهُ عَنْ اَمْرِهِ <br>\
                  <i>I prevented him from executing his affair.</i> (Msb.) It is said in a trad. of Er-Rabeea Ibn-Kheythem, (TA,) اِعْكِسُوا اَنْفُسَكُمْ عَكْسَ الخَيْلِ بِاْللُّجُمِ <br>\
                  <i>Rein in,</i> or <i>refrain,</i> (TA,) or <i>turn back,</i> (A, TA,) <i>yourselves</i> [<i>as one reins in,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>horses by means of the bits and bridles</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b6-  And عَكَسَ الشَّىْءَ <br>\
                  <i>He pulled the thing towards the ground, and pressed it,</i> or <i>squeezed it, hard, then smote the ground with it.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  One says also, عَكَسْتُ, aor.      <br>\
                     عَكِسَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. عَكْسٌ, [app. meaning <i>I poured milk upon broth;</i> for it is said to be] from عَكِيسٌ in the first of the senses assigned to it below: (O:) or العَكْسُ signifies <i>the pouring</i> <br>\

                  طَعَام [or <i>food</i>]: (K:) and اللَّبَنَ ↓ <br>\
      اِعْتَكَسَ signifies the same as عَكَسَ: (TA:) [or both of these verbs are intrans.;] عَكَسَ and اعتكس from عَكِيسٌ signify the same [app. without اللَّبَنَ]. (JM.)    </entryFree> <br>\
