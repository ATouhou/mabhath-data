Jawáleekee says, the common people do not distinguish between the عام and the سنه, making them both to have the same meaning; but the right state of the case is what I have been told on the authority of Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà [i. e. Th], that the سنه is from any day from which one commences a reckoning to the like thereof, and the عام is only [<i>a period of</i>] <i>a winter and a summer;</i> and it is also said in the T and in the Bári that the عام is <i>a</i> <br>\
                  حَوْل <br>\
                  <i>that makes an end of a winter and a summer,</i> so that every عام is a سنة, but every سنة is not an عام; for when you reckon from a day to the like thereof, that is a سنة, and there may be in it half of the summer. and half of the winter, whereas the عام is only <i>a winter and a summer, without interruption:</i> (Msb, MF: *) Er-Rághib mentions a difference in the uses of the words عَامٌ and سَنَةٌ [as has been stated in art. سنو and سنى: see سَنَةٌ in that art.] and Suh says, in the R, that the سنة is longer than the عام; that the former is “ a single revolution of the sun; ” and that the latter is applied to the [<i>twelve</i>] <i>Arabian months</i> [<i>collectively</i>]: it is said to be called عام because of the sun&#39;s عَوْم [or coursing] through all of its zodiacal signs [during the period which it denotes]: (TA:) its pl. is اَعْوامٌ, (S, Msb, K,) because the sing. is originally of the measure فَعَلٌ [i. e. عَوَمٌ]: (Msb:) it has no other pl. than this. (TA.) ―         -b2-  One says, لقِيتُهُ <br>\
                  عَامًا اَوَّلَ [<i>I met him in a former year;</i> generally meaning, <i>the year immediately preceding,</i> or, as we say, <i>last year</i>]; making the last word imperfectly decl. as being an epithet [and of the measure of a verb]: and لَقِتُهُ عَامًا اَوَّلًا [<i>I met him in a year before:</i> generally meaning the same as the phrase preceding]; making the last word perfectly decl. as not being an epithet [but an ad(??) and K in art. وال) or the meaning is, (??) <i>year</i>] <i>before this year;</i> even if it be by a number of years: (&#39;Alee El-Kári, on the authority of Seer, in a marginal note in my MS. copy of the K, art. اول:) and one says also, accord. to AZ and IAar, لَقَيتُهُ عَامَ الاَوَّلِ; (TA in art. وال;) or the is rarely said; (K and TA in that art.;) or should not be said; (ISk, S and TA in that art.;) (??) should one say, لَقَيتُهُ عَامَ اَوَّلَ (ISk TA in the present art.) And [in like manner] one says, ما رَاَيْتُهُ مُذْ عَامٌ اَوَّلُ, putting the last word in the nom case as being an epithet, (S and K in art. وال,) as though he said اَوَّلُ مِنْ عَامِنَا [i. e. <i>I have not seen him since a year preceding</i> this <i>one year</i>]; (S in that art.;) and مُذْ عَامٌ اَوَّلَ, putting the last word in the accus. case as an adv n., (S and K * in that art.,) as though he said مُذْ عامٌ قَبْلَ عَامِنَا [<i>since a year before</i> this <i>our year</i>]; (S in that art.;) and مُذْعَامًا اَوَّلَ and مُذْ عَامُ الاَوَّلِ are also mentioned by different authors (??)in art, منذ) And [using the dim. form] one says, لَقِتُهُ ذَاتَ ↓ <br>\
      العُوَيْمِ i. e. [<i>I met him</i>] <i>in the course of some years;</i> like as one says, لَقِيتُهُ ذَاتَ الزُّمَيْنِ, and ذَاتَ مَرَّةٍ: (S:) or the meaning is, (<i>some few years ago;</i> or] <i>three years ago</i> or <i>more,</i> to <i>ten:</i> (AZ, Az, TA:) and it is like the saying, لَقِيتُهُ مُنْذُ <br>\
                  سُنَيَّاتٍ: the fem. form is used because they mean by it مَرَّة وَاحِدَة. (Az, TA.) ―         -b3-  One says also نَاقَةٌ بَازِلُ عَامٍ and بَازِلُ عَامِهَا [<i>A she-camel that has passed a year,</i> and <i>her year, after cutting her tush</i>], (TA,) and بازِل عَامَيْنِ <br>\

And it is applied, in a trad., as an epithet to the حَنْظَل [or colocynth, meaning <i>That is of service in the year of drought,</i> or <i>barrenness</i>]; because it is procured, or prepared [as an article of food], in the year of drought, or barrenness.

      اَعْوَمُ, and] the pl. of اَفْعَلُ is فُعْلٌ; but they pronounce it as above, as though the sing. were عَامٌ عَايِمٌ: ISd says, عَامٌ ↓ <br>\
