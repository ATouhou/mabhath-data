So in a trad., where a lamp is mentioned as suspended to the عرش: (O, TA:) and in another, in which a man relates that he used, when upon his عرش, to hear the Prophet&#39;s reciting [of the Kur-án]. (TA.) And so it has been expl. as occurring in the phrase of the Kur [ii. 261 and xxii. 44], خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا <br>\
                  <i>Having fallen down upon its roofs:</i> meaning that its walls were standing when their roofs had become demolished and had fallen to the foundations, and the walls fell down upon the roofs demolished before them: (O, TA:) but some consider على as here meaning عَنْ [from]. (TA.) ―         -b7-  [Hence, app.,] العَرْشُ is applied to <i>The</i> <br>\
                  عَرْش <br>\
                  <i>of God, which is not definable:</i> (A, K:) I&#39;Ab is related to have said that the كُرْسِىّ is the place of the feet and the عَرْش is immeasurable: and it is said in the Mufradát of Er-Rághib that the عَرْش of God is <i>one of the things which mankind know not in reality, but only by name;</i> and it is not as the imaginations of the vulgar hold it to be; [namely, <i>the throne of God;</i>] for were it so, it would be a support to Him; not supported; whereas God saith [in the Kur., xxxv. 39], “ Verily God holdeth the heavens and the earth, lest they should move from their place; and if they should move from their place, no one would hold them after Him: ” or, as some say, it is <i>the highest sphere;</i> [or <i>the empyrean;</i>] and the كرسىّ is the sphere of the stars: and they adduce as an indication thereof the saying of Mohammad, that the seven heavens and earths, by the side of the كرسىّ, are nought but as a ring thrown down in a desert land; and such is the كرسىّ with respect to the عَرْش: and this assertion is mentioned in the B, but without approval: (TA:) [it appears, however, to be most commonly accepted:] or <i>a red sapphire, which glistens with the light of the Supreme.</i> (A, K.) [Hence the saying,] مِنَ <br>\
                  العَرْشِ اـِلَى الفَرْشِ meaning, [<i>From the highest sphere,</i> or <i>the empyrean, to</i>] <i>the earth.</i> (A.) ―         -b8-  Also <i>The</i> <br>\
                  سَرِير [or <i>throne</i>] (S, A, O, Msb, K) <i>of a king;</i> (S, A, O, K;) the <i>seat of a sultán;</i> [perhaps as being likened to the عرش of God; or, more probably, from its being generally surmounted by a canopy; or] because of its height. (Er-Rághib.) [Hence,] the phrase اِسْتَوَى عَلَى <br>\
                  عَرْشِهِ means <i>He reigned as king.</i> (A, TA.) ―         -b9-  And [hence, also,] <i>Certain stars in advance of</i> <br>\
                  السِّمَاك الاَعْزَل [which is <i>Spica Virginis</i>]; (TA;) [app. those meant by what here follows;] عَرْشُ <br>\

                  عَجُزُ الاَسَدِ [<i>the rump of Leo,</i> the figure of which was extended by the Arabs far beyond the limits which we assign to it]. (S, O, K.) ―         -b10-  And عَرْشُ الجَوْزَا=ءِ [<i>The seat of Orion;</i> applied by our astronomers to        <br>\
      <orth lang=&quot;gr&quot;>α</orth> <br>\
                  <i>of Lepus;</i> but described as] <i>four stars, of which two are on the fore legs and two on the hind legs, of Lepus.</i> (Kzw.) ―         -b11-  And عَمْشُ الثَّرَيَّا <br>\
                  <i>Certain stars near</i> <br>\
                  الثُّرَيَّا [or <i>the Pleiades</i>]. (T, TA.) ―         -b12-  عَرْشٌ also signifies The جَمَازَة; (O, K, TA;) i. e., the <i>bier of a corpse.</i> (O, TA.) And hence, as some say, the expression in a trad., اِهْتَزَّ العَرْشُ لِمَوْتِ سَعْدِ بْنِ مُعَاذٍ, meaning <i>The bier rejoiced</i> [lit. <i>shook</i>] <i>at the death of Saad Ibn-Mo&#39;ádh;</i> i. e., at carrying him upon it to his place of burial: (O, K, * TA:) but there are other explanations, for which see art. هز. (TA.) ―         -b13-  The <i>wood with which a well is cased after it has been cased with stones</i> (S, O, K) <i>in its lowest part</i> (S, O) <i>to the height of the stature of a man:</i> (S, O, K:) pl. عُرُوشٌ. (S, O.) [Another meaning of the same word in relation to a well has been mentioned before.] ―         -b14-  (assumed tropical:)  The <i>nest</i> of a bird, <i>such as is built in a tree,</i> (K,) [app. as being likened to a booth.] ―         -b15-  The <i>angle, or corner, or strongest side,</i> syn. رُكْن, (Ks, Zj, K,) of a house, (Ks, Zj,) or [other] thing: (K:) pl. عُرُوشٌ. (Ks, Zj.) Accord. to some, the phrase in the Kur [ii. 261, mentioned above], خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا, means <i>Empty, and fallen to ruin upon its</i> <br>\
                  اَرْكَان [or <i>angles,</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (Ks, Zj, O.) ―         -b16-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  The <i>head,</i> or <i>chief, who is the manager</i> or <i>regulator of the affairs,</i> of a people, or company of men: (K:) likened to the عَرْش of a house. (TA.) ―         -b17-  [Hence also,] (assumed tropical:)  The <i>means of support of a thing,</i> or <i>an affair.</i> (A, O, K.) Hence the saying, ثُلَّ عَرْشُهُ, (O, K,) meaning (tropical:)  <i>His means of support became taken away:</i> (TA:) or <i>he perished:</i> (A:) or <i>he was slain;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
