      عَطَّنَت: (K:) and العُطُونُ, (K, TA,) it is said, (TA,) signifies <i>the resting,</i> or <i>the driving back to the nightly resting-place,</i> a she-camel <i>after her drinking:</i> (K, TA:) or <i>the bringing</i> her <i>back to the</i> <br>\

(TA.) قَدْ عَطَنُوا مَوَاشِيَهُمْ occurs in a trad. as meaning <i>They had rested,</i> or <i>had driven back to the nightly resting-place, their cattle.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  عَطَنَ الجِلْدَ, aor.      <br>\

                  عَلْقَى, <i>which is a certain plant,</i> (S,) so says J, but, as &#39;Alee Ibn-Hamzeh says, it is the غَلْقَة, a well-known plant, not the عَلْقَى, that is used for this purpose, (IB, TA,) [or perhaps عَلْقَى is a mistranscription for غَلْقَى, which is said in the K in art. غلق to be a syn. of غَلْقَةٌ,] or فَرْث [i. e. <i>the feces thus termed</i>], or <i>salt, and threw the skin into it, and covered it over, in order that its wool might become dissundered and loose;</i> after which it is thrown into the tan: (S:) or, as also ↓ <br>\
      عطّنهُ, <i>he put the skin into the tan, and left it so that it became corrupt and stinking:</i> (K:) or <i>he sprinkled water upon it,</i> (K, TA,) <i>and folded it,</i> (TA,) <i>and buried it</i> (K, TA) <i>for a day and a night,</i> (TA,) <i>so that its hair</i> (K, TA) or <i>its wool,</i> (TA,) <i>became loose;</i> in order that it might be plucked off; (K, TA;) and that it [the skin] might be then thrown into the tan, it being then stinking in the utmost degree: (TA:) or العَتْنُ signifies <i>the putting</i> [a skin] <i>into the tan.</i> (Az, TA.)       -A3-  عَطِنَ, aor.      <br>\

                  عَطْن [expl. above]: (AZ, S, TA:) or <i>it was put into the tan, and left so that it became corrupt and stinking:</i> (K:) or <i>water was sprinkled upon it,</i> (K, TA,) <i>and it was folded,</i> (TA,) <i>and buried</i> (K, TA) <i>for a day and a night,</i> (TA,) <i>so that its hair</i> (K, TA) or <i>its wool</i> (TA) <i>became loose;</i> in order that it might be plucked off; (K, TA;) and that it [the skin] might be then thrown into the tan, it being then stinking in the utmost degree: (TA:) and ↓ <br>\
      انعطن signifies the same: (S, K:) or this signifies <i>it</i> (a skin) <i>became loose in its wool without becoming corrupt.</i> (AHn, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>He watered the camels and then made them to lie down</i> [<i>at the water</i>]: (S, TA:) or <i>he confined the camels at the water, and they lay down, after having come to it</i> [<i>and drunk</i>], (K, TA,) <i>in order that they might drink again:</i> (TA:) this the Arabs do only in the intense heats of summer; not when the season becomes cool: (Msb:) or they do this only when the asterism of the Pleiades (الثُّرَيَّا) rises [auro-  rally, i. e. about the middle of May, O. S.], and men return from the seeking after herbage to the places of waters, or of constant sources of water: they do so only on the day of the camels&#39; coming to the water; and they cease not to do thus [when necessary] until the time of the [auroral] rising of Canopus (سُهَيْل [i. e. early in August, O. S.]), in the خَرِيف, [app. here meaning the period of the rain so called, (see the latter of the two tables in page 1254,)] after which they do it not, but the camels come to the water and drink their draught and return from the water: (Az, TA:) or اعطن الاـِبِلَ signifies <i>he brought back the camels to the</i> <br>\
                  عَطَن [q. v.], <i>waiting in expectation with them, because they did not drink the first time.</i> (So in the CK [agreeably with what here follows; but see 1, first sentence].) And one says, اعطن <br>\

      مَعْطِنٌ (ISk, S, Mgh, Msb, K) or مَعْطَنٌ (TA [but this I find not elsewhere]) The <i>usual abiding-place of camels:</i> (K:) and also, (K, TA,) by predominance of usage, (TA,) or only, (Az, Msb, TA,) the <i>place of camels, where they lie down,</i> (Az, S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) <i>at the water,</i> (Az, S, TA,) or <i>around the water,</i> (Mgh, Msb,) or <i>around the watering-trough,</i> (K, TA,) <i>in order that they may drink a second time, after the first draught, and then be sent back to the places of pasture to remain there during the intervals between the waterings;</i> (S;) and likewise the <i>places of sheep</i> or <i>goats, where they lie down around the water:</i> (ISk, S, Msb, K, TA:) pl. of the former اَعْطَانٌ; and of the latter ↓ <br>\
      مَعَاطِنُ; (Az, S, Mgh, Msb, K;) which latter pl. is used by the lawyers as meaning [generally] the <i>places of lying down of camels.</i> (Msb.) The [space called] حَرِيم [q. v.] of the well of the عَطَن is said to be forty cubits. (Mgh.) Prayer in the اَعْطَان of camels is forbidden, because the person praying is not secure from being hurt by them, and diverted from his prayer, and defiled by the sprinkling of their urine. (IAth, TA.) ضَرَبَتِ <br>\
                  الاـِبِلُ بِعَطَنٍ [in which الاَرْضَ is understood after الابل] means <i>The camels lay down</i> [<i>in a place by the water</i>]: (S:) or <i>satisfied themselves with drinking and then lay down around the water</i> or <i>by the watering-troughs, to be brought again to drink another time.</i> (IAth, TA.)

                  <i>The she-camel lay down</i> [&amp;amp;c.]. (TA.) And ضَرَبَ النَّاسُ بِعَطَنٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The people&#39;s camels satisfied themselves with drinking until they lay down and remained in their place</i> [<i>at the water</i>]; occurring in a trad.: (TA in art. ضرب:) or <i>the people satisfied their thirst and then abode at the water.</i> (K and TA in the present art.) ―         -b2-  [Hence] one says, فُلَانٌ وَاسِعُ العَطَنِ وَالبَلَدِ, (S,) or رَحْبُ العَطَنِ, (K, TA,) (tropical:)  <i>Such a one is a person possessing much wealth; having an ample dwelling</i> or <i>place of abode;</i> (K, TA;) <i>endowed with extensive power</i> or <i>strength</i> or <i>might;</i> or <i>liberal, munificent,</i> or <i>generous.</i> (S, K, TA.)       -A2-  And العَطَنُ signifies العِرْضُ [app. as meaning <i>Odour,</i> from the same word as inf. n. of عَطِنَ said of a hide]: so in the saying of &#39;Adee Ibn-Zeyd, cited by Sh, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
