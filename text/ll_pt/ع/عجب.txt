      تعجّب, and ↓ <br>\
      استعجب <br>\
                  منه, (S, O, Msb, K,) which two are syn. each with the other, (S, O, K,) and with the first also; (S, K;) all signify <i>He wondered at it;</i> i. e. <i>he deemed it strange, extraordinary,</i> or <i>improbable,</i> said of a thing occurring, or presenting itself, to him; (K, TA;) <i>on account of his being little accustomed to it:</i> (TA:) or the first signifies [as above, i. e.] <i>he deemed it strange, extraordinary,</i> or <i>improbable:</i> and ↓ <br>\
      تَعَجُّبٌ is of two kinds; one is [the <i>wondering</i>] at a thing which one commends, and it means the <i>accounting</i> (a thing) <i>good</i> or <i>goodly,</i> or <i>approving</i> [it], <i>and expressing one&#39;s approval</i> of a thing; and the other is at a thing that one dislikes, and it means the <i>deeming</i> [a thing] <i>strange, extraordinary,</i> or <i>improbable, and discommending</i> [it]: (Msb:) or, accord. to some of the grammarians, it signifies the <i>mind&#39;s becoming affected,</i> or <i>acted upon, by some excessive quality</i> in the thing by which it is so affected; [so that it may be rendered the <i>becoming affected with wonder;</i>] as when one says مَا اَشْجَعَهُ [“ how courageous is he! ”] and اَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَاَبْصِرْ [“ how clearly shall they hear! and how clearly shall they see! ”]: (Msb, MF, TA:) or it is [the <i>wondering</i>] at a thing of which the cause, or reason, is hidden, and not known: or it is when one sees a thing that pleases him, and thinks that he has not seen the like of it: (L, TA:) [therefore تَعَجَّبَ مِنْهُ may be rendered <i>he wondered at it,</i> and <i>he admired it:</i>] accord. to some, it peculiarly relates to what is deemed good or goodly, or approved; [though this is inconsistent with the application of the grammatical term فِعْلُ التَّعَجُّبِ <br>\
                  <i>the verb of wonder;</i>] and the subst. derived from it is ↓ <br>\
      عَجْبٌ: and ↓ <br>\
      استعجب relates to what is good or goodly or approved, and to what is otherwise; and the subst. is ↓ <br>\
      عَجَبٌ [which is also the inf. n. of عَجِبَ]: or accord. to the A and L, ↓ <br>\
      استعجب signifies <i>he wondered</i> at a thing <i>intensely;</i> or <i>became affected with intense wonder.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  [عَجَبًا لِهٰذَا, a phrase of common occurrence, (mentioned in the K voce وَيْبٌ, &amp;amp;c.,) is for اَعْجَبُ عَجَبًا لِهٰذَا <br>\
                  <i>I wonder greatly,</i> lit. <i>with wondering, at this.</i> See also an ex. voce عَجَبٌ, last sentence but two.] ―         -b3-  Of the words in the Kur xxxvii. 12, there are two readings, بَلْ <br>\
                  عَجِبْتَ وَيَسْخَرُونَ and بل عَجِبْتُ ويسخرون: accord. to the former, the meaning is, <i>Nay, thou wonderest</i> at their conduct, or <i>deemest it extraordinary,</i> [O Mohammad,] <i>and they mock:</i> respecting the latter reading, [which may be rendered <i>Nay, I wonder,</i> &amp;amp;c.,] it is observed that عَجَبٌ when attributed to God has a meaning different from that which it has when attributed to men: IAth says that, when attributed to God, it is used in a tropical manner, as the causes of things are not hidden from Him: or, accord. to IAmb, the verb here meams <i>I have recompensed</i> them <i>for</i> their <i>wondering</i> at the truth, or their <i>deeming</i> it <i>strange</i> or <i>improbable:</i> and in like manner it is said [in the Kur viii. 30], يَمْكُرُونَ <br>\
                  وَيَمْكُرُ اْللّٰهُ [lit. “ They plot and God plotteth ”], meaning, “ God recompenseth them for their plotting. ” (L, TA.) ―         -b4-  It is also said that عَجَبٌ when attributed to God [sometimes] means The <i>being well pleased, content,</i> or <i>satisfied.</i> (K, TA.) The saying, in a trad., عَجِبَ رَبُّكَ مِنْ قَوْمٍ يُقَادُونَ <br>\
                  اـِلَى الجَنَّة فِى السَّلَاسِلِ means <i>Thy Lord wonders at a people who will be led to Paradise in chains</i> [because of their deeming themselves unworthy thereof]; the verb عجب being here used in a tropical sense: or the meaning is, <i>thy Lord is well pleased with,</i> and will reward, <i>a people</i> &amp;amp;c.: and there are other trads. of the same kind. (L, TA.) ―         -b5-  عَجِبَ اـِلَيْهِ means <i>He loved,</i> or <i>liked, him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (L, TA.) [See a verse cited voce عَجِيبٌ; from which it seems to signify lit. <i>He,</i> or <i>it, was an object of love to him.</i>]       -A2-  عَجِبَتْ, inf. n. عَجَبٌ; and عَجُبَتْ; said of a she-camel, <i>She was,</i> or <i>became, such as is termed</i> <br>\

                  <i>It</i> (a thing, or an affair, or event, TA) <i>induced,</i> or <i>excited, him to wonder.</i> (K, TA. [See also 2.]) In the following saying of Ibn- Keys-er-Rukeiyát, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> the meaning is, [<i>She saw upon my head some hoariness, which I did not hide; and she said to me,</i> “ <i>Is this Ibn-Keys?</i> ” <i>somewhat of hoariness</i>] <i>causing her to have wonder.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  And <i>It</i> (a thing, or an affair, or event, TA) <i>induced in him wonder,</i> or <i>admiration, and pleasure,</i> or <i>joy:</i> (K:) or <i>it excited his admiration,</i> or <i>approval:</i> (Msb:) or <i>it pleased,</i> or <i>rejoiced, him.</i> (TA.) You say, اَعْجَبَنِى هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ لِحُسْنِهِ [<i>This thing has excited my admiration,</i> or <i>approval,</i> or <i>has pleased me, for its goodness,</i> or <i>goodliness,</i> or <i>beauty</i>]. (S, O.) And اَعْجَبَنِى حُسْنُهُ [<i>Its goodness,</i> or <i>goodliness,</i> or <i>beauty, excited my admiration,</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (Msb.) ―         -b3-  And اُعْجِبَ بِهِ <br>\
                  <i>He was excited to wonder,</i> or <i>admiration, and pleasure,</i> or <i>joy, by it; he admired it, and was pleased with it,</i> or <i>rejoiced by it.</i> (K.) You say, اُعْجِبَ <br>\
                  بِنَفْسِهِ, (S, O, Msb,) inf. n. اـِعْجَابٌ, [which is often used as syn. with عُجْبٌ, the corresponding subst.,] (O,) [<i>He admired himself,</i> (lit. <i>was excited to admiration by himself,</i>) <i>was pleased with himself,</i> or <i>was self-conceited,</i> or <i>vain;</i> or] <i>he exalted,</i> and <i>magnified, himself; was haughty,</i> and <i>proud.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b4-  [مَا اَعْجَبَهُ generally signifies <i>How wonderful is it!</i>] ―         -b5-  مَا اَعْجَبَهُ بِرَاْيِهِ [<i>How greatly does he admire his opinion</i> or <i>judgment!</i> or <i>how greatly is he pleased with it!</i> or <i>how conceited,</i> or <i>vain,</i> or <i>proud, is he of it!</i>] is anomalous [in two respects], (S, O, K,) not to be taken as an example to be imitated; (S, O;)  for the verb here is formed from a passive [and augmented] verb [اُعْجِبَ], like as is the case in مَا اَشْغَلَهُ; whereas it is the primary rule with respect to the verb of wonder that it shall not be formed from any but an active [and unaugmented] verb.

      تَعَاجِيبُ signifies <i>wonderful things;</i> syn. عَجَايِبُ; (S, O, K;) and is a word [of a rare form, (see تَبَاشِيرُ,)] having no proper sing., (S, O,) like تَعَاشِيبُ; (O;) erroneously thought by the author of the “ Námoos ” [on the Kámoos] to be most probably a mistake for اَعَاجِيبُ: (TA:) a poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
