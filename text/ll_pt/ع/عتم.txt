                   The primary signification of the inf. n. عَتْمٌ in the [genuine] language of the Arabs is that of <i>Tarrying</i> [or <i>delaying</i>]: and of <i>withholding,</i> or <i>restricting,</i> or <i>limiting, oneself.</i> (TA.) See 2, in three places. [Hence,] one says, غَرَسْتُ الوَدِىَّ <br>\
                  فَمَا عَتَمَ مِنْهَا شَىْءٌ i. e. [<i>I planted the shoots of palm-trees,</i>] <i>and not any of them was slow</i> or <i>tardy</i> [<i>in its growth</i>]. (S.) And عَتَمَتْ حَاجَتُهُ <br>\

                  تُفِيقَ means <i>Delay ye the milking of your camels,</i> or <i>cattle, until the milk shall have collected:</i> (K, TA:) for they used to bring back their camels a little after sunset to their nightly resting-place, and make them to lie down there a while, until, when their milk had collected, after a portion of the night had passed, they roused them and milked them.
