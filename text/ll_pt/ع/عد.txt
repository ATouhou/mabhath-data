      مَا اَكْثَرَ عَدِيدَهُمْ means عَدَدَهُمْ [i. e. <i>How great is their number!</i>]. (A.) Zj says that عَدَدٌ is sometimes used in the sense of an inf. n.; as in the phrase in the Kur [xviii. 10], سِنِينَ عَدَدًا: but many say that it is in this instance used in its proper sense, meaning مَعْدُودَةً [i. e. <i>numbered</i>], and is made masc. because سِنِين is syn. with اَعْوَام.

                  كُلَّ شَىْءٍ عَدَدًا, in the Kur [lxxii. last verse], it is used in its proper sense of مَعْدُودًا, and is put in the accus. case as a denotative of state; or it is used in this case as an inf. n. (IAth, O.) ―         -b2-  It signifies also The <i>years of</i> a man&#39;s <i>life, which one numbers,</i> or <i>counts.</i> (IAar, O, K.
