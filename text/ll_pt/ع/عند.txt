                  مُسْتَقِرًّا عِنْدَهُ [<i>And when he saw it standing in his presence</i> (in the Kur xxvii. 40)] is an ex. of its use as denoting presence perceptible by sense: and it is used as denoting nearness in the phrase عِنْدَ سِدْرَةِ اْلْمُنْتَهَى [<i>Nigh to the lote-tree of the ultimate point of access</i> (in the Kur liii. 14)]: (Mughnee:) you say also, عِنْدِى مَالٌ, meaning <i>With me,</i> or <i>by me,</i> i. e. <i>present with me, is property;</i> and meaning also <i>in my possession, and in my power and at my disposal, is property,</i> though absent from me; <i>I have,</i> or <i>possess, property;</i> (Msb, Mughnee; *) and لِى عِنْدَهُ مَالٌ [<i>I have property in his hands,</i> or <i>possession;</i> or <i>there is property due to me in his hands,</i> or <i>possession;</i> meaning, <i>owed to me by him</i>]; as also قِبَلَهُ: (TA in art. قبل:) hence it is used in relation to attributes; so that one says, عِنْدَهُ خَيْرٌ وَفَضْلٌ [<i>He has,</i> or <i>possesses, goodness and excellence</i>]; and مَا عنِدَهُ <br>\
                  شَرٌّ [<i>He has not evil</i>]: and hence the saying in the Kur [xxviii. 27], فَاـِنْ اَتْمَمْتَ عَشْرًا فَمِنْ عِنْدِكَ i. e. [<i>And if thou complete ten</i> years, it will be] <i>of thy redundant bounty;</i> (Msb;) [or <i>of thine own freewill;</i> as is implied in the explanation by Bd, and agreeably with common usage:] and it is used as denoting ideal presence in the phrase قَالَ اْلَّذِى عِنْدَهُ عِلْمٌ مِنَ اْلْكِتَابِ [<i>He with whom was,</i> i. e. <i>who possessed, knowledge the of Scripture said</i> (in the Kur xxvii. 40)]: (Mughnee:) [hence also] one says, لِى عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ حَاجَةٌ [<i>I have an object of want to be sought,</i> or <i>required, at the hand of such a one,</i> or <i>a want to be supplied on the part of such a one;</i> meaning <i>I want a thing of such a one;</i> as also قِبَلَ فُلَانٍ]: (TA in art. حوج:) [and in like manner one says of a right or due (حَقٌّ): and طَلَبَ حَاجَةً عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ <br>\

                  مِنْ لَدُنَّا عِلْمًا [<i>Upon whom we had bestowed mercy from us, and whom we had taught, from us, knowledge</i> (in the Kur xviii. 64)]: (Mughnee:) [and in an ex. above, from the Kur xxviii. 27: and one says of a gift, هٰذَا مِنْ عِنْدِى, meaning <i>This is from,</i> or <i>of, my property;</i> or <i>from me;</i> or, by way of emphasis, <i>from myself:</i>] one should not say [as the vulgar do], مَضَيْتُ اـِلَى عِنْدِكَ; nor اـِلَى لَدُنْكَ.
