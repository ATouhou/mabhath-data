                  تَمَحَّلَ: (K:) Fr says, تَعَلَّثْتُ لَهُ الذُّنُوبَ is like تَمَحَّلْتُ [app. meaning <i>I laboured, and exercised art</i> or <i>management, in seeking to do to him misdeeds:</i> see art. محل]. (O.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  مَنْكِح [or <i>wife</i>]: (S, A, * O, K: *) in which sense also يغتلث is a dial. var.: (TA:) and in like manner one says اعتلث [alone], and ↓ <br>\
      اَعْلَثَ. (So in a copy of the A. [But I doubt the correctness of the latter verb; and the more so as it is not quite clear whether it be meant to be expl. as having this meaning, or as meaning <i>It</i> (a زَنْد) <i>failed to produce fire,</i> and therefore, perhaps, a mistranscription for عَلَثَ.]) ―         -b3-  And اعتلث السَّهْمَ <br>\
