      اِعْتَافَهُ signifies the same as عَافَهُ. (TA.) A poet says, (namely, Anas Ibn-Mudrik, O, TA, and so in a copy of the S,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>Verily I, in the case of my slaying Suleyk and then giving the bloodwit for slaying him, am like the bull that is beaten when the cows loathe</i> the water]: for when the cows hold back from entering into the water and drinking, they are not beaten, because they have milk, but only the bull is beaten, in order that they may be frightened, and therefore drink. (S, O, TA. [See also the Ham, p. 416; where the former hemistich is somewhat differently related.]) And hence the saying, هٰذَا مِمَّا يَعَافُهُالطَّبْعُ [<i>This is of the things that the natural disposition dislikes,</i> or <i>loathes</i>]. (Mgh.)       -A2-  عِفْتُ الطَّيْرَ, aor. اَعِيفُهَا, inf. n. عِيَافَةٌ, <i>I augured from the birds,</i> (S, O, K, TA,) <i>good</i> or <i>evil,</i> (O, K, TA,) <i>taking warning,</i> or <i>the like, by considering their names, and their places of alighting</i> (S, O, K, TA) <i>and of passage,</i> (TA,) <i>and their cries:</i> thus, correctly, as in the T and S and M and L, i. e. وَاَصْوَاتِهَا; for which the authors of the O and K have substituted وَاَنْوَايِهَا, deceived by the word مَسَاقِط in what goes before: and the verb is used in like manner in relation to gazelles or other animals passing with the right side, or the left side, turned towards the spectator: (TA:) العِيَافَةُ primarily signifies <i>the</i> man&#39;s <i>throwing a pebble at a bird,</i> or <i>crying out at it; and, if it turn its right side towards him in flying, the auguring good from it; and if its left side, evil:</i> (Har p. 308:) or, accord. to Az, it signifies <i>the seeing a bird,</i> (TA,) or <i>a raven,</i> or <i>crow,</i> (Msb, TA,) or <i>the like,</i> (Msb,) <i>and auguring evil</i> [or <i>good</i>] <i>therefrom:</i> (Msb, TA:) and also <i>the saying</i> [a thing] <i>conjecturally,</i> or <i>surmising; without</i> <br>\
                  <i>seeing anything:</i> and it is said in a trad. to be مِنَ الجِبْتِ [expl. in art. جبت]: the verb in عِفْتُ الطَّيْرَ, as ISd says, is originally عَيِفْتُ. (TA.)       -A3-  عَافَتِ الطَّيْرُ, aor. تَعِيفُ, inf. n. عَيْفٌ, (S, O, K,) is like عافت having for its aor, تَعُوفُ and inf. n. عَوْفٌ, (K, TA,) i. e. (TA) <i>The birds circled over the water,</i> or <i>over carcasses</i> or <i>corpses, and went to and fro, not going away, desiring to alight.</i> (S, O, TA.

                   is a term employed in the case when a woman brings forth and her milk is suppressed in her breast, wherefore her fellow-wife, or female neighbour, draws it, by the single sucking and the two suckings: (Nh, O, L, K, * TA: but in the K, فَتَرْضِعُهَا is erroneously put for فَتَرْضِعُهُ; and المَرَّةَ and المَرَّتَيْنِ are put for المَرَّةَ and المَرَّتَيْنِ: TA:) thus in the saying of ElMugheereh, (O, K, TA,) as expl. by himself, (O, TA,) لَا تُحَرِّمُ العَيْفَةُ [i. e. <i>The woman&#39;s sucking once and twice in drawing the breast of another woman whose milk is suppressed after child-birth will not render unlawful</i> the marriage of either of them to a relation of the other, nor the marriage of a relation of either to a relation of the other; as the case of regular or continued suckling of a child does]: (O, K, TA: [but in the O and CK, تُحَرَّمُ is erroneously put for تُحَرِّمُ: see a similar saying voce مَزَّةٌ:]) the action is performed in order that the obstructed channels by which the milk issues may become opened: and it is thus termed because the woman loathes it: (Az, O, K:) A&#39;Obeyd says, We know not العَيْفَة in sucking the breast, but think it to be العُفَّة: his saying thus, however, is disapproved by Az. (O, K, * TA.)       -A2-  عَيْفَةٌ is also the subst. from عَافَتِ الطَّيْرُ [q. v., app. signifying <i>A circling</i> of birds <i>over the water,</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (S, O, K.)    </entryFree> <br>\
