      عَسُوبٌ; (K;) or this signifies [simply] <i>a lord,</i> or <i>chief,</i> like يَعْسُوبٌ: (O:) pl. يَعَاسِيبُ. (TA.) It is said in a trad. of &#39;Alee, When such and such things shall happen (mentioning factions, or seditions), ضَرَبَ يَعْسُوبُ <br>\
                  الدِّينِ بِذَنَبِهِ; (A, O, TA;) in which, accord. to As, يعسوب الدين means <i>the chief of men in respect of religion</i> at that time; (TA;) or it means <i>the leader of the religion:</i> (T and TA in art. ضرب:) and it is said that ضرب بذنبه here means <i>shall quit the faction,</i> or <i>sedition, and its party, with his partisans in religion;</i> by ذنبه being meant <i>his followers;</i> and by ضرب, <i>shall go away through the land, journeying,</i> or <i>warring in the cause of the religion:</i> or , as Z says, ضرب <br>\
                  بذنبه means (tropical:)  <i>shall remain, and be firm, together with his religious followers;</i> and accord. to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, the same is said of the locust, when it lays its eggs, thrusting its tail into the ground; and the meaning here is, (assumed tropical:)  <i>shall remain firm</i> until the people shall return to him, and the religion become manifest, and spread abroad. (TA. [See also ضَرَبَ and ذَنَبٌ.]) ―         -b3-  Also (tropical:)  <i>Gold;</i> so called because it is that by means of which an affair is managed, or ordered: and [in a larger sense] <i>a thing to which one has recourse for protection</i> or <i>the like;</i> as in a saying of &#39;Alee, in which wealth is termed the يعسوب of the unbelievers or of the hypocrites. (TA.) ―         -b4-  And <i>A certain flying thing, smaller than the locust;</i> (As, A&#39;Obeyd, K;) or <i>larger;</i> (K;) <i>and having a long tail:</i> (TA:) or <i>a certain flying thing, longer than the locust, that does not contract its wings when it alights;</i> to which a horse is likened for the slenderness of its body: (S, O:) or <i>a kind of moth,</i> or <i>the like,</i> (فَرَاشَةٌ,) <i>of a greenish colour, that flies in the</i> [<i>season called</i>] رَبِيع. (IAth, TA.) [Golius explains it as “ <i>Insectum oblongum, quaternis pennis volucre, mordella</i> Gazæ, <i>seu orsodacna</i> Aristot. ” ] ―         -b5-  And <i>A species of</i> <br>\
                  حَجَل [or <i>partridge</i>]. (O, K, TA.) ―         -b6-  And <i>A blaze,</i> or <i>white mark, on a horse&#39;s face,</i> (K, TA,) <i>of a long shape, terminating before it extends as far as the upper parts of the nostrils;</i> or <i>extending upwards along the bone of the nose, wide and straight, until it reaches the lower part of the even portion of the forehead, whether it be little</i> or <i>much, if it do not reach as far as the eyes:</i> (TA:) or <i>a white line,</i> or <i>stripe, of the blaze, extending downwards until it touches the fore part of the nose and mouth.</i> (En-Nadr, A&#39;Obeyd, Az, O.) ―         -b7-  And (accord. to Lth, O) <i>A</i> <br>\
                  دَايِرَة [or what we term a <i>feather</i>] <i>in the part of the flank of a horse where the rider strikes it with his foot:</i> (O, K, TA:) but Az says that this is a mistake, and that the correct meaning is that given above on the authority of A&#39;Obeyd. (TA.) ―         -b8-  The ى in يَعْسُوبٌ is augmentative; because there is no Arabic word of the measure فَعْلُولٌ except صَعْفُوقٌ. (S, O.)   </entryFree> <br>\
