      عتّر], <i>He slaughtered</i> [or <i>sacrificed</i>] (S, O, K, TA) an عَتِيرَة, (S, O,) [i. e.] a sheep or goat, or a gazelle or the like. (TA.) Sometimes a man, (S, O,) of the people of the Time of Ignorance, (S,) made a vow that, if he should see what he loved, he would slaughter such and such of his sheep or goats; and when the performance of the vow became obligatory, he would be unwilling to do so, and would slaughter gazelles instead of the sheep or goats: (S, O:) sometimes he would say, “ If my camels amount to a hundred, I will slaughter for them an عَتِيرَة; ” but when they amounted to a hundred, he would be niggardly of the sheep or goat, and would hunt a gazelle, and slaughter it. (TA.) One says, هٰذِهِ اَيَّامُ تَرْجِيبٍ and تَعْتَارٍ [<i>These are days of the sacrificing of the</i> <br>\

It is said in a trad. that there is no harm in a man&#39;s treating himself medically with senna and عِتْر while in a state of اـِحْرَام: (S, O:) which, some say, means that there is no harm in taking these from the sacred territory for such treatment.
