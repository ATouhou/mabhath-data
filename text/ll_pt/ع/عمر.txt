      اَعْمَرَ, with ا.

      عُمْرٌ are both inf. ns., signifying the same. (S, O.) [See 1. As such, the former is the more common.] And both of these words, (Mgh, K, &amp;amp;c.,) and ↓ <br>\
      عُمُرٌ, (K, &amp;amp;c.,) [used as  simple substs., or abstract ns., in which case the second is more common than the first, except in forms of swearing, in which the former is used, and the third is more chaste than the second,] signify <i>Life;</i> (Msb, K;) [the <i>age to which the life extends;</i>] the <i>period during which the body is inhabited by life:</i> so that it denotes less than بَقَا=ءٌ: wherefore the latter is [frequently] used as an attribute of God; but عمر is seldom used as such: (Er-Rághib, B:) pl. اَعْمَارٌ. (K.) You say ↓ <br>\
      اَطَالَ اْللّٰهُ عُمُرَكَ and عَمْرَكَ [<i>May God prolong thy life</i>]. (S, O.) In a form of swearing, عَمْر only is used. (S.) [In a case of this kind, when ل is not prefixed to it, it is in the accus. case, as will be shown and expl. below: but when ل is prefixed to it, it is in the nom.] You say لَعَمْرُكَ لَاَفْعَلَنَّ, meaning <i>By thy life, I will assuredly do</i> [such a thing]. (Msb.) لَعَمْرُكَ occurs in the Kur xv. 72, and means <i>By thy life:</i> (I&#39;Ab, Akh, Bd, Jel:) and ↓ <br>\
      لَعَمَرُكَ is a dial. var., mentioned by Yoo: (O:) or the former, accord. to the grammarians, means <i>by thy religion:</i> (AHeyth, O:) and [in like manner] لَعَمْرِى, and ↓ <br>\
      لَعَمَرِى, [<i>by my life,</i> or] <i>by my religion.</i> (K.) لَعَمْرُكَ is an inchoative, of which the enunciative, مَا اُقْسِمُ <br>\
                  بِهِ, [<i>that by which I swear,</i> so that the entire phrase means <i>thy life is that by which I swear,</i>] is understood; therefore it is in the nom. case: (IJ, TA:) or the complete phrase is وَعَمْرِكَ <br>\
                  فَلَعَمْرُكَ عَظِيمٌ [<i>by thy life,</i> &amp;amp;c.: <i>and thy life is of great account</i>]. (Fr, as related by A&#39;Obeyd.) You say also لَعَمْرُ اَبِيكَ الخَيْرَ, and الخَيْرِ; the former meaning <i>By thy father&#39;s instituting,</i> or <i>promoting,</i> or <i>keeping to,</i> or <i>observing,</i> or <i>regarding, what is good;</i> <br>\
                  الخير being the objective complement of عمر, from عَمَرَ الخَيْرَ, aor.      <br>\
                     عَمُرَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. عَمْرٌ and عِمَارَةٌ; [see 1;] but in the latter case, الخَيْرِ is an epithet added to اَبِيكَ [so that the meaning is <i>by the life of thy good father</i>]. (AHeyth, Az, O, TA.) [See also art. خير.] You also say لَعَمْرُ اْللّٰهِ, meaning <i>By the everlasting existence of God;</i> (S, O, K;) عمر being here in the nom. case as an inchoative, with ل prefixed to it as a corroborative of the inchoative state: the enunciative is understood; the complete phrase being لَعَمْرُ اْللّٰهِ قَسَمِى or مَا اُقْسِمُ بِهِ [<i>the everlasting existence of God is my oath,</i> or <i>that by which I swear</i>]. (S, O.) This expression is forbidden in a trad., (K,) because عَمْرٌ [properly] means the life of the body: (TA:) [but] لَعَمْرُ <br>\
                  اـِلٰهِكَ, meaning <i>By the everlasting existence of thy God,</i> occurs in a trad. (TA.) When you do not prefix ل, you make it to be in the accus. case, as an inf. n.: thus you say, عمْرَ اْللّٰهِ مَا فَعَلْتُ كَذَا (S, O, K) I swear <i>by the everlasting existence of God, I did not so:</i> (S, O:) and عَمْرَكَ اْللّٰهَ مَا <br>\
                  فَعَلْتُ كَذَا (S, O, K, [in the CK اللّٰهُ, but this is a mistake,]) <i>By thine acknowledgment of the everlasting existence of God, I did not so:</i> (S, O:) or the original thereof is عَمَّرْتُكَ اْللّٰهَ تَعْمِيرًا, (O, K,) i. e., <i>I ask,</i> or <i>beg, God to prolong thy life:</i> (Ks, O:) [and it is said in the S that عَمْرَكَ <br>\
                  اْللّٰهَ sometimes has this signification:] and in like manner عَمْرَكَ اْللّٰهَ لَا اَفْعَلُ ذَاكَ means <i>I beg God to prolong thy life: I will not do that:</i> or it may be a form of oath without و [for وَعَمْرِكَ]: (Ks:) and you say عَمْرَكَ اْللّٰهَ اِفْعَلْ كَذَا and اـِلَّا فَعَلْتَ <br>\
                  كَذَا [and اـِلَّا مَا فَعَلْتَ كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>By thine acknowledgment of the everlasting existence of God,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>do thou so</i>]: (TA:) or عَمْرَكَ اْللّٰهَ signifies <i>by thy worship of God:</i> (AHeyth:) or I remind thee, <i>reminding thee, of God.</i> (K.) Mbr says of this phrase, عمرك اللّٰه, that عمر may be in the accus. case on account of a verb understood; [such, for instance, as اُذَكِّرُكَ;] or by reason of و suppressed, the complete phrase being وَعَمْرِكَ اْللّٰهَ; or as being for [the inf. n.] تَعْمِير. (TA.) It may also be [found written] عَمْرَ اْللّٰهَ; but this is bad. (Ks.) Some of the Arabs, for لَعَمْرُكَ, said رَعَمْلُكَ.
