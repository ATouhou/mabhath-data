(S.) [And hence, perhaps,] one says to him who possesses much property, اعل به i. e. ابق بعده [app. اُعْلُ بِهِ and اِبْقَ بَعْدَهُ, as though meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Have thou ability to consume it,</i> and so <i>survive thou it;</i> like as one says to him who puts on a new garment, اَبْلِ (see 4 in art. بلو)]: or [perhaps a mistake for “ and ”] it is [virtually] a prayer for his continuance in life.

                  <i>upon the flat house-top</i>]: (Msb:) [in like manner also,] as denoting الاستعلا=ء that is perceptible by sense, it occurs in the saying [in the Kur lv. 26], كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ [<i>Every one that is upon it</i> (referring to the earth) <i>is transitory</i>]: (Es-Subkee, TA:) and you say, عَلَى زَيْدٍ ثَوْبٌ [<i>Upon Zeyd is,</i> or <i>was, a garment</i>], عَلَى being here a particle; and عَلَا زَيْدًا ثَوْبٌ [<i>A garment was upon Zeyd,</i>] عَلَا being here a verb. (Mbr, S.) And it denotes الاستعلا=ء, likewise, tropically thus termed, (Msb, TA,) such as is ideal, or perceived by the intel-lect; (Msb, Es-Subkee, Mughnee, TA;) as in the saying زَيْدٌ عَلَيْهِ دَيْنٌ (tropical:)  [<i>Zeyd, a debt is lying upon him,</i> or <i>incumbent on him,</i> i. e. <i>he owes a debt,</i> <br>\

                  مَالٌ is also said to mean كَثُرَ [i. e.

And it [likewise] denotes ideal استعلا=ء in the phrase لَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنْبٌ (tropical:)  [<i>A crime,</i> or <i>an offence, committed upon</i> (or here, as in many other instances, it may be rendered <i>against</i>) <i>me is imputable to them</i>]: (Mughnee:) and so in the saying [in the Kur ii. 254 and xvii. 22], فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ (tropical:)  [<i>We have made some of them to have superiority over some</i>]. (Es-Subkee, Mughnee, TA.) [See also اَنْتَ عَلَى عَيْنِى, and and اَنْتَ عَلَى رَاْسِى, voce عَيْنٌ, first quarter.] ―         -b3-  It also denotes concomitance, like مَعَ; as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 172], وَا=تَى المَالَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ [<i>And giveth property with</i> (or <i>notwithstanding</i>) <i>the love of it</i>]; (Mughnee, K;) and so it is said to be used in the phrase, in a trad. respecting the alms of the breaking of the fast [of Ramadán], عَلَى كُلِّ حُرٍّ وَعَبْدٍ صَاعٌ [<i>With every free man and slave, a sáa</i>], because the alms-gift of the breaking of the fast is not incumbent on the slave, but only on his master; (IAth, TA;) and so it is used in the [common] phrase, عَلَى اَنَّنِى رَاضٍ [<i>With</i> (or <i>notwithstanding</i>) <i>my being pleased,</i> or <i>well pleased,</i> or <i>content</i>].
