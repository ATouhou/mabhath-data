      اِعْمَاىَ, aor. يَعْمَايُ, inf. n. اِعْمِيَا=ءٌ; (K;) [said by SM to be like اِرْعَوَى, aor. يَرْعَوِى, inf. n. اِرْعِوَا=ءٌ; as though اِعْمَاىَ were originally اِعْمَىَّ, like as اِرْعَوَى is originally اِرْعَوَّ, both being of the measure اِفْعلَّ; but he adds, correctly, that,] accord. to Sgh, اِعْمَاىَ is originally like اِدْهَامَمَ, which becomes اِدْهَامَّ, [i. e. it is originally اِعْمَايَىَ,] but the latter ى is changed into ا because of the fet-hah of the former, so that it becomes اِعْمَايَا, and the two, thus differing, do not easily admit of idghám (TA;) and sometimes the ى of اِعْمَاىَ is musheddedeh, (Sgh, K, TA,) so that it becomes [↓ <br>\
      اِعْمَاىَّ, aor. يَعْمَاىُّ, inf. n. اِعمِيَّا=ءٌ,] like اِدْهَامَّ, aor. يَدْهَامُّ, inf. n. اِدْهِيمَامٌ; but this is by a straining of a point, and not in use: (Sgh, TA:) and ↓ <br>\
      تعمّى, likewise, signifies the same, (K, TA,) i. e., the same as عَمِىَ. (TA.) And you say also, عَمِيَتْ عَيْنَاهُ <br>\
                  <i>His two eyes were,</i> or <i>became, blind.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  Hence عَمًى is metaphorically used in relation to the mind, as meaning (tropical:)  <i>An erring;</i> the connection between the two meanings being the <i>not finding,</i> or <i>not taking, the right way:</i> (Msb:) or the <i>being blind in respect of the mind:</i> and in this sense, the verb is as above, with the exception of the measure اِفعَالَّ [and the abbreviated form of this]. (K, * TA. [اَفْعَالٍ in the CK in this passage is a mistranscription, for اْفْعَالَّ.]) You say, عَمِىَ عَنْ <br>\

[Accord. to the TA, the inf. ns. of these two verbs, thus used, are عميان and عطشان: but they are correctly عَمًى and عَطَشٌ.])       -A2-  عَمَى <br>\
                  المَوْجُ, aor. يَعْمِى, (S, K,) inf. n. عَمْىٌ, (S,) <i>The waves cast the particles of rubbish,</i> or <i>the like,</i> (S, K, TA,) <i>driving them to their upper,</i> or <i>uppermost, parts,</i> (TA,) <i>and the foam.</i> (S, TA.) ―         -b2-  And عَمَى بِلُغَامِهِ, (K, TA,) aor. يَعْمِى, (TA,) <i>He</i> (a camel) <i>brayed, and cast the foam of his mouth upon his head,</i> or <i>the upper part of his head,</i> or <i>anywhere:</i> (K, TA:) mentioned by ISd. (TA.) ―         -b3-  And [hence] عَمَانِى بِكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  <i>He cast upon me a suspicion of such a thing.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  عَمَى, aor. يَعْمِى, said of water, (K, TA,) and of other things, (TA,) also signifies <i>It flowed;</i> (K, TA;) and so هَمَى. (TA.) ―         -b5-  And عمى النَّبْتُ [app. عَمَى] and ↓ <br>\
      اعتمى and اِعْتَمَّ are three syn. dial. vars., (TA in this art.,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>The plant,</i> or <i>herbage, became of its full height, and blossomed;</i> (S, K, TA, in explanation of the last, in art. عم;) and <i>became luxuriant,</i> or <i>abundant and dense.</i> (TA in that art.)    </entryFree> <br>\
