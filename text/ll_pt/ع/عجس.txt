                     عَجِسَ<br>\
                  ,] inf. n. عَجْسٌ, (S, O,) <i>He grasped it;</i> (S, O, K;) namely, a thing [such, for ex., as a bow]: (S:) [and <i>he grasped it hard;</i> for] عَجْسٌ signifies also the <i>grasping</i> a thing <i>hard.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  And عَجَسَهُ عَنْ حَاجَتِهِ, aor. as above, (O, K,) and so the inf. n., (O,) <i>He,</i> or <i>it, withheld him from the object of his want;</i> (O, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      تعجّسهُ: (TA:) and ↓ <br>\
      تعجّسهُ is likewise said of a radical, or hereditary, evil quality, meaning <i>It withheld him from generous actions;</i> (Sh, O, K;) as also تعقّلهُ and تثفّلهُ. (Sh, O.) And عَجَسَنِى عَنْكَ <br>\
                  <i>It</i> (an affair, or event,) <i>withheld me from thee.</i> (AO, O.) And بِهِمْ ↓ <br>\
      تعجّس <br>\
                  <i>He withheld them;</i> and <i>he held them back,</i> or <i>made them slow</i> or <i>tardy:</i> (Sh, O, K: *) and one says, بِىَ الرَّاحِلَةُ ↓ <br>\
      تَعَجَّسَتْ <br>\
                  <i>The riding-camel kept me back,</i> or <i>made me slow</i> or <i>tardy.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  عَجَسَ and ↓ <br>\
      تعجّس alone signify <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, slow, tardy, late,</i> or <i>backward:</i> (TA:) and the latter signifies [likewise] <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, behind,</i> or <i>backward;</i> or <i>he remained behind,</i> or <i>held back.</i> (O, TA.) ―         -b4-  And one says of a she-camel, عَجَسَتْ بِهِ, (O, K,) aor. as above, (K,) and so the inf. n., (TA,) meaning <i>She turned aside,</i> or <i>away, with him from the road, by reason of her briskness, liveliness,</i> or <i>sprightliness;</i> (O, K, TA;) and so ↓ <br>\
      تعجّست; and, as written by El-Urmawee, ↓ <br>\

                   see 1, in six places. ―         -b2-  تعجّسهُ also signifies <i>He reckoned,</i> or <i>esteemed, his judgment,</i> or <i>opinion, weak.</i> (Sh, O, * TA.) ―         -b3-  And <i>He upbraided him,</i> or <i>reproached him, for a thing,</i> or <i>an affair,</i> (IDrd, K, TA,) <i>which he had commanded him to do.</i> (IDrd, TA.) ―         -b4-  And تعجّس <br>\
                  اَمْرَهُ <br>\
                  <i>He searched repeatedly after the knowledge of his</i> (i. e. another&#39;s S, O) <i>affair,</i> or <i>case.</i> (S, O, K.) Hence, in a trad., فَيَتَجَّسُكُمْ فِى قُرَيْشٍ <br>\
                  <i>And he seeks repeatedly after you among Kureysh.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  And تعجّست الاَرْضَ غُيُوثٌ <br>\
                  <i>Rains fell, one after another, upon the earth,</i> or <i>land,</i> (S, O, K, TA,) <i>and bore heavily upon it.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  تعجّس الرَّجُلُ <br>\

      بِعُجْسَةٍ, K, [but see what follows,]) <i>of the night:</i> (O, K:) El-Marrár Ibn-Sa&#39;eed El-Fak&#39;asee says, describing his travelling-companions, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

(O: in which بعجسة is thus written, with fet-h and damm, and with مَعًا above them.) [It is also said in the O (immediately after this verse), and likewise in the K and TA (in neither of which is the verse cited), in all of them probably from one and the same source, that ↓ <br>\
      المُتَعَجِّسُ means المُتَشَمْخِرُ; and it is added in the TA that this has been mentioned in its place: but it is not mentioned in its proper art. in the O nor in the K nor in the TA; and it is evidently a mistranscription, for المُسْتَحِرُ, part. n. of اِسْتَحَرَ (q. v. voce اَسْحَرَ), and therefore I have rendered المُتَعَجِّس as above.]    </entryFree> <br>\
