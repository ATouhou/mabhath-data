(TA.) You say, عَثَرَ فِى ثَوْبِهِ [<i>He stumbled,</i> or <i>tripped, upon his garment</i>]. (S, O, Msb.) And فِى اَذْيَالِهِ ↓ <br>\
      خَرَجَ يَتَعَثَّرُ [<i>He went forth stumbling,</i> or <i>tripping, upon his skirts</i>]. (A.)

And it is said in a prov., الجَوَادُ قَدْ يَعْثُرُ [<i>The swift and excellent horse sometimes stumbles,</i> or <i>trips</i>]: applied to a person by whom a slip that is not of his nature is seen to have been committed.

      اَعْثَرَ signifies the same; but accord. to the usage of the Kur-án, you say اَعْثَرْتُ غَيْرِى: so in the Kitáb el-Abniyeh of IKtt. (TA. [See 4.]) You say, عَثَرَ عَلَى سِرِّ الرَّجُلِ (tropical:)  <i>He obtained knowledge of,</i> or <i>became acquainted with, the secret of the man</i> [<i>accidentally</i>]. (TA.) [Hence,] فَاـِنْ عُثِرَ عَلَى اَنَّهُمَا اْسْتَحَقَّا اـِثْمًا, in the Kur [v. 106], means (tropical:)  <i>But if it become known,</i> or <i>seen,</i> (Ksh, Mgh, O, Bd, Jel,) <i>that they two have done what has necessitated sin,</i> (Ksh, Bd, Jel,) and <i>deserved its being said of them that they were sinners.</i> (Ksh.)

(TA.) And اعثرهُ اْللّٰهُ is syn. with اَتْعَسَهُ [of which see various explanations in art. تعس]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] اعثر بِهِ <br>\
                  عِنْدَ السُّلْطَانِ, (K,) or عِنْدَهُ ↓ <br>\

Hence the phrase in the Kur [xviii. 20] اَعْثَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ; (S, Ta;) in which غَيْرَهُمْ, the objective complement, is suppressed. (TA.)

                  <i>A pit dug for a lion or other</i> [<i>animal</i>], (S, A, O,) <i>that he may fall into it,</i> (A,) <i>in order that he may be taken:</i> (S, O:) this is the primary signification: (A:) or <i>a thing that is prepared for one to fall into it:</i> (K:) or, as also عثار [i. e. ↓ <br>\
      عَثَارٌ or ↓ <br>\
      عِثَارٌ (see what follows)], <i>a thing by which one is made to stumble and fall;</i> expl. by بِهِ ↓ <br>\
      مَا عُثِرَ: (TA:) the pl. is عَوَاثِيرُ; whence, perhaps, عَوَاثِرُ, by suppression of the ى. (O, TA. [See عَاثرٌ.]) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  <i>A place of perdition:</i> (TA voce حَاجُورٌ:) or (tropical:)  <i>a cause,</i> or <i>place, of perdition</i> or <i>of death:</i> (A, K:) applied to a land. (K.) You say, وَقَعَ فِى عَاثُورٍ (tropical:)  <i>He fell into a cause,</i> or <i>place, of perdition</i> or <i>of death.</i> (A, TA.) And فُلَانٌ يَقِى صَاحِبَهُ العَوَاثِرَ (tropical:)  [<i>Such a one preserves his companion from the causes,</i> or <i>places, of perdition</i> or <i>of death</i>]. (A.) And it is said in a trad., اـِنَّ قُرَيْشًا اَهْلُ اَمَانَةٍ مَنْ <br>\
                  بَغَاهَا العَوَاثِيرَ كَبَّهُ اْللّٰهُ لِمَنْخِرَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Verily</i> the tribe of <i>Kureysh are people of fidelity: whoso seeks for them the causes,</i> or <i>places, of perdition</i> or <i>of death, may God lay him prostrate upon his nostrils</i>]: or, accord. to one relation, عَوَاثِرَ. (O, TA.) ―         -b3-  And [hence,] (tropical:)  <i>Difficulty,</i> or <i>distress;</i> as also عَاثُورُ شَرٍّ: (S, O:) and <i>evil;</i> (K, TA;) like عَاذُورٌ, which is a dial. var. thereof, or an instance of mispronunciation; (S and O in art. عذر;) as also ↓ <br>\
      عَثَارٌ, (accord. to some copies of the K,) or ↓ <br>\
      عِثَارٌ: (thus in other copies of the K and in the TA [in the latter of which it is said to be with kesr; and this I think to be the more probably correct; originally an inf. n.]:) and شَرٍّ ↓ <br>\
      عِثَارُ is said by Fr to signify the same as عَاثُورُ شَرٍّ. (TA.) You say, لَقِيتُ مِنْهُ عَاثُورًا, (As, S, O, TA,) and ↓ <br>\
      عِثَارًا, (TA,) (tropical:)  <i>I experienced from him,</i> or <i>it, difficulty,</i> or <i>distress.</i> (As, S, O, TA.) And وَقَعُوا فِى عَاثُورِ شَرٍّ, (As, S, O, TA,) and عَافُورِ شَرٍّ, (S, O,) (tropical:)  <i>They fell into difficulty,</i> or <i>distress:</i> (As, S, O:) or <i>into a confusion of evil and difficulty</i> or <i>distress.</i> (TA.) It is the opinion of Yaakoob that the ف in عَافُور is a substitute for the ث in عَاثُور: but Az observes that this is not necessarily the case, as the meaning of difficulty is implied in the root عفر. (TA.) ―         -b4-  It is said to signify also <i>A kind of snare</i> (مِصْيَدَة) <i>made of bark.</i> (O.) ―         -b5-  And <i>A channel that is dug for the purpose of irrigating thereby a palm-tree such as is termed</i> <br>\
                  بَعْلٌ. (O.) ―         -b6-  And <i>A well.</i> (K.)       -A2-  And it may also be used as an epithet [app. meaning <i>Perilous,</i> or <i>destructive</i>]. (ISd, TA.)   </entryFree> <br>\
