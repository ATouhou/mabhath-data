                     عَرُضَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. عِرَضٌ, [instead of which, as a simple subst., عَرْضٌ is generally used,] and عَرَاضَةٌ, <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, broad,</i> or <i>wide;</i> (S, O, * Msb, K, TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
      اعرض, (A, TA,) which occurs in this sense in two exs. following. (TA.) [And in like manner, ↓ <br>\
      استعرض <br>\
                  <i>It grew,</i> or <i>spread, wide;</i> said of a tree; opposed to طَالَ; occurring in the TA in art. بهل.] It is said in a prov., القِرْفَةُ ↓ <br>\
      اَعْرَضَتِ (S, O, * TA [but in two copies of the S, I find the verb in this instance written اعرضتُ, and in the O اعرضتَ, and I do not know that the reading in the TA, which seems to be the common one, is found in any copy of the S,]) <i>Suspicion became,</i> or <i>has become, wide;</i> syn. اِتَّسَعَت: (TA:) used when it is said to a man, “ Whom dost thou suspect ? ” and he answers, “ The sons of such a one, ” referring to the whole tribe. (S, O, TA.) [See Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 112, where another reading is mentioned, which, by what he says, is shown to be اَعْرَضْتَ <br>\
                  القِرْفَةَ <br>\
                  <i>Thou hast made suspicion wide.</i>] In another prov. it is said, ثَوْبُ المَلْبَسِ ↓ <br>\
      اَعْرَضَ (IAar, A, TA, and K in art. لبس,) and المِلْبَسِ and المُلْبِسِ (IAar, and K in art. لبس,) and المُلْتَبِسِ (TA in art. لبس) i. e. صَارَ ذَا عَرْضٍ, (A, TA,) and عَرُضَ, and اِتَّسَعَ; (Sh;) [meaning the same as the prov. before mentioned;] used with reference to him whose suspicion has become wide; (IAar, and TA in art. لبس;) i. e. with reference to him who suspects many persons (IAar, Az, and K in art. لبس,) of a theft; (IAar, Az, and TA in that art.;) or of saying a thing: (TS, and TA in that art.:) or when thou askest a person respecting a thing and he does not explain it to thee. (TA in that art.) [See, again, Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 100, where it is said that اَعْرَضَ ثَوْبُ <br>\
                  المُلْبِسِ app. means <i>The garment of the suspected appeared,</i> or <i>has appeared:</i> but that another reading is عَرُضَ, meaning <i>became,</i> or <i>has become, wide.</i>]       -A2-  عَرَضَ, aor.      <br>\

                     عَرِضَ<br>\
                  , like حَسِبَ, aor.      <br>\
                     عَرِضَ<br>\
                  , deviating from the general rule; (As, TS;) <i>It</i> (a thing) <i>appeared,</i> or <i>became apparent,</i> <br>\
                  لَهُ <br>\
                  <i>to him;</i> (S, O, Msb, K; [but in some copies of the K, instead of the explanation ظَهَرَ وَبَدَا, we find ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ وَبَدَا, which is a mistake;]) as also ↓ <br>\
      اعرض, (Fr, S, O, Msb, K,) which is a deviation from a general rule, being quasi pass. of عَرَضَهُ, which see below; (S, * O, * Msb, K;) [lit.] <i>it showed its breadth,</i> or <i>width.</i> (O, * TA.) You say, لَكَ الشَّىْءُ ↓ <br>\
      اعرض <br>\
                  مِنْ بَعِيدٍ <br>\
                  <i>The thing appeared to thee from afar.</i> (TA.) And عَرَضَتْ لَهُ الغُولُ, and عَرِضَتْ, (AZ, S, O, K,) <i>The ghool appeared to him.</i> (K.) The Arabs say, of a thing, عَرَضَ and ↓ <br>\
      اعرض and ↓ <br>\
      تعرّض and ↓ <br>\
      اعترض, using these verbs as syn.; (Sh;) [app. as meaning <i>It showed, presented,</i> or <i>offered, itself,</i> (lit. <i>its breadth,</i> or <i>width,</i> or <i>its side,</i> see 5,) to a person: the first and last also often signify, and the others sometimes, <i>he obtruded himself</i> in an affair; <i>interfered</i> therein:] IKt disallows ↓ <br>\
      اعرض in the sense of اعترض, as not having been found by him: (TA:) [but] an instance of the former of these two verbs used in the sense of the latter of them occurs in the phrase لِلنَّاظِرِينَ ↓ <br>\
      اـِذَا اُعْرَضَتْ [app. meaning <i>When she shows,</i> or <i>presents, herself to the lookers</i>], in a poem by one of the tribe of Teiyi. (Sh.) ―         -b2-  عَرَضَ لَكَ الخَيْرُ, [in one place in the TA الخَبَرَ, and الخبر in a copy of the Msb,] inf. n. عَرْضٌ; (TA; [in one place in the TA عُرُوضٌ there referring to الخَبَرُ, which is app. a mistranscription;]) and ↓ <br>\
      اعرض; (S, O, K, TA;) <i>Good</i> [i. e. <i>the doing of good</i>] <i>hath become within thy power,</i> or <i>practicable to thee,</i> or <i>easy to thee.</i> (S, O, K, TA.) And لَكَ الظَّبْىُ ↓ <br>\
      اعرض <br>\
                  <i>The gazelle hath exposed to thee its side;</i> (TA;) or <i>hath put its side in thy power,</i> (S, O, K, TA,) <i>by turning it towards thee:</i> (O, TA:) said to incite one to shoot it, or cast at it. (S, O.) Or لَكَ ↓ <br>\
      اعرض, said of an animal of the chase, or other thing, signifies <i>It hath put in thy power,</i> [or <i>exposed to thee,</i>] <i>its breadth,</i> or <i>width:</i> (A:) or لَهُ ↓ <br>\
      اعرض signifies <i>it</i> (a thing) <i>became within his power,</i> or <i>practicable to him,</i> or <i>easy to him;</i> lit., <i>it showed its side</i> [<i>to him</i>]. (Mgh.) [In the TA, I find اَعْرَضَ فِى الشَّىْءِ expl. as signifying <i>He had the width of the thing in his power:</i> but فى, here, seems to be a mistake for لَهُ.] A poet, also, says ↓ <br>\
      اَعْرِضِى addressing a woman; meaning اَمْكِنِى [<i>Empower thou;</i> i. e. <i>grant thou access</i>]. (S.) ―         -b3-  عَرَضَ لَهُ, aor.      <br>\
                     عَرِضَ<br>\
                  ; (As, S, K, TA;) and عَرِضَ, aor.      <br>\
                     عَرَضَ<br>\
                  ; (TA;) are also said of an event, (As, TA,) or of a disease, and the like, (S, K, TA,) such as disquietude of mind, and a state of distraction of the mind or attention; (TA;) [meaning <i>It happened to him; it befell him; it occurred to him; was incident to him;</i>] and also of doubt, and the like. (TA.) [So, too, is ↓ <br>\
      اعترض.] You also say, عَرَضَهُ عَارِضٌ مِنَ الحُمَّى وَنَحْوِهَا [<i>An occurrence of fever, and the like, happened to him,</i> or <i>befell him</i>]. (S.) And البَدَنَ ↓ <br>\
      اعترض [<i>It befell the body</i>] is said of [a disease, as, for instance,] the mange, or scab. (B, in TA in art. عر.) ―         -b4-  عَرَضَ <br>\
                  لَهُ, aor.      <br>\
                     عَرِضَ<br>\
                  ; (Msb, TA;) and عَرِضَ له, aor,      <br>\
                     عَرَضَ<br>\
                  ; (Msb;) <i>He intervened as an obstacle to him, preventing him from attaining his desire,</i> (Msb, TA, *) or <i>from seeking to attain his desire,</i> and <i>from going his way;</i> (TA;) as also له ↓ <br>\
      اعترض. (Msb.) You say also, عَرَضَ لَهُ اَشَدَّ العَرْضِ, and ↓ <br>\
      اعترض, <i>He opposed himself to him</i> (قَابَلَهُ بِنَفْسِهِ) <i>with the most vehement opposition of himself.</i> (TA.) See also 5, second sentence. One should not say, عرّضتُ لَهُ, with teshdeed, in the sense of اِعْتَرَضْتُ. (Msb.) You also say, عَرَضَ عَارِضٌ, meaning [<i>An obstacle intervened,</i> or <i>prevented;</i> lit.] <i>an intervening thing intervened; a preventing thing prevented.</i> (TA.) And سِرْتُ فَعَرَضَ لِى فِى الطَّرِيقِ عَارِضٌ مِنْ جَبَلٍ <br>\
                  وَنَحْوِهِ <br>\
                  <i>I journeyed, and there opposed itself to me, so as to prevent my going on, an obstacle consisting in a mountain, and the like;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      اعترض: whence the اِعْتِرَاضَات [or <i>objections</i>] of the lawyers; because they prevent one&#39;s laying hold upon the evidence. (Msb.) And عَرَضَ لَهُ الشَّىْءُ <br>\
                  فِى الطَّرِيقِ <br>\
                  <i>The thing intervened as an obstacle to him in the way, preventing him from going on.</i> (TA.) And عَرَضَ الشَّىْءُ <br>\
                  <i>The thing stood up and prevented;</i> [or <i>stood in the way,</i> or <i>presented itself as an obstacle;</i> or <i>opposed itself;</i>] as also ↓ <br>\
      اعترض. (TA.) [And <i>The thing lay,</i> or <i>extended, breadthwise,</i> or <i>across,</i> or <i>athwart;</i> like اعترض, q. v.] And الشَّىْءُ دُونَ الشَّىْءِ ↓ <br>\
      اعترض <br>\
                  <i>The thing intervened as an obstacle in the way to the thing;</i> syn. حَالَ. (S, O.) ―         -b5-  مَا عَرَضْتُ لَهُ <br>\
                  بِسُوْءٍ, aor.      <br>\
                     عَرِضَ<br>\
                  ; and ما عَرِضْتُ, aor.      <br>\
                     عَرَضَ<br>\
                  ; signify ما <br>\
                  تَعَرَّضْتُ: see 5: or, as some say, <i>I did not,</i> or <i>have not, become exposed to his reviling,</i> or <i>evilspeaking, by reviling,</i> or <i>speaking evil, of him.</i> (Msb.) [See also عَرَضَ عِرْضَهُ, below.] ―         -b6-  عَرَضَ <br>\
                  لَهُ also signifies <i>He went towards him;</i> (TA in art. نحو;) and عَرَضَ عَرْضَهُ and عُرْضَهُ [the same, i. e.] نَحَا نَحْوَهُ; (K;) as also عرضه ↓ <br>\

                  <i>pass</i> by him, [<i>and to Mundhir:</i> or perhaps, <i>if thou go</i> to him: or <i>if thou present thyself</i> to him.] (S.) ―         -b8-  عَرَضَ الفَرَسُ, (L, K,) aor.      <br>\
                     عَرِضَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. عَرْضٌ, (L, TA,) <i>The horse went along inclining towards one side:</i> (K, TA:) or <i>ran inclining his breast and head:</i> (L, TA:) and <i>ran inclining his head and neck;</i> (K; [in which only the inf. n. of the verb in this last sense is mentioned;]) the doing of which is approved in horses, but disapproved in camels. (TA.) [See also 3, and 5.] ―         -b9-  عَرَضَ <br>\
                  البَعِيرُ, (K,) inf. n. عَرْضٌ, (TA,) <i>The camel ate of the</i> <br>\
                  اَعْرَاض, i. e. of the <i>upper parts of the trees</i> [or <i>shrubs</i>]. (K.) ―         -b10-  عَرَضَتْ, said of a she-camel, <i>A fracture,</i> (S, O, K,) or <i>some injurious accident,</i> (S, O,) <i>befell her;</i> (S, O, K;) as also عَرِضَتْ; (O, K;) but the former is the more approved: (TA:) and عَرَضَ لَهَا <br>\
                  <i>a disease,</i> or <i>a fracture, befell her.</i> (TA, from a trad.) Also, said of a sheep, or goat, (شاة,) <i>It died by disease.</i> (K.) And عَرِضَ الشَّا=ءُ <br>\
                  <i>The sheep,</i> or <i>goats, burst,</i> or <i>became rent, from abundance of herbage.</i> (K.) And عَرَضَ, (IKtt,) inf. n. عَرْضٌ, (K,) <i>He</i> (an animal, IKtt, or a man, K, [but it is said in the TA that there is no reason for this restriction,]) <i>died without disease.</i> (IKtt, K.) ―         -b11-  عَرَضَ بِسِلْعَتِهِ <br>\
                  <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  عَارَضَ بِهَا. (K.) See 3, in two places. [And under the same, see a similar phrase.] ―         -b12-  عَرَضَ <br>\
                  <i>He</i> (a man, S, O) <i>came to</i> <br>\
                  العَرُوض, i. e. <i>Mekkeh</i> and <i>El-Medeeneh,</i> (S, O, K, TA,) and <i>El-Yemen,</i> (TA,) <i>and what is around them.</i> (S, O, K, TA.)       -A3-  عَرَضَ الشَّىْءَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.      <br>\
                     عَرِضَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. عَرْضٌ, (Msb,) <i>He made the thing apparent; showed it; exhibited it; manifested it; exposed it to view; presented it;</i> (S, O, Msb, K;) <i>unfolded it; laid it open:</i> and also <i>he mentioned it:</i> (Msb:) [lit. <i>he showed its breadth,</i> or <i>width,</i> or <i>its side:</i> and hence it also signifies <i>he made the thing to stand as an obstacle,</i> <br>\
                  دُونَ شَىْءٍ <br>\
                  <i>in the way to,</i> or <i>of, a thing.</i>] You say, عَرَضَ لَهُ الشَّىْءَ <br>\
                  <i>He made apparent, showed, exhibited, manifested,</i> or <i>exposed to view, to him the thing;</i> (S, O, K;) <i>unfolded it,</i> or <i>laid it open, to him.</i> (S, TA.) And عَرَضَ <br>\
                  عَلَيْهِ اَمْرَ كَذَا (S, O, K *) <i>He showed, propounded,</i> or <i>proposed, to him, such a thing,</i> or <i>such a case:</i> (K, * TA:) [and <i>he asked,</i> or <i>required, of him, with gentleness, the doing of such a thing;</i> for] العَرْضُ signifies طَلَبٌ بِلِينٍ, (Mughnee and K, voce اَلَا,) or طَلَبٌ بِلِينٍ وَتَاَدُّبٍ. (Mughnee voce لَوْلَا.) And عَرَضْتُ المَتَاعَ لِلْبَيْعِ [<i>I showed, exposed, presented,</i> or <i>offered, the commodity for sale;</i> or] <i>I showed the commodity to those desirous of purchasing it.</i> (Msb.) The phrase عَرَضَ عَلَيْهِ المَتَاعَ [<i>He showed,</i> or <i>offered, to him the commodity</i>] is used because the person shows to the other the length and breadth of the thing (طُولَهُ وَعَرْضَهُ), or because he shows him one of its sides (عُرْضًا <br>\
                  مِنْ اَعْرَاضِهِ). (Mgh.) [Hence,] it is said in a trad. of Hodheyfeh, تُعْرَضُ الفِتَنُ عَلَى القُلُوبِ <br>\
                  عَرْضَ الحَصِيرِ, which means, accord. to some, that فِتَن [<i>Temptations,</i> &amp;amp;c.,] <i>will be</i> [<i>displayed and</i>] <i>embellished to the hearts</i> of men <i>like</i> [<i>as</i>] <i>the ornamented and variegated garment called</i> <br>\
                  حصير [<i>is displayed and embellished</i>]: (B, TA in art. حصر:) or the meaning is, that they <i>will be laid and spread upon the hearts like the</i> <br>\
                  حصير: (IAth, TA in the present art.:) and some say that by this last word is here meant a certain vein extending across upon the side of a beast, towards the belly. (TA in art. حصر.) [Hence also,] عَرْضٌ <br>\
                  سَابِرِىٌّ [<i>A slight exhibition:</i> (see art. سبر:)] so in the proverbs by A&#39;Obeyd, in the handwriting of Ibn-El-Jawáleekee: (TA:) or عَرْضُ سَابِرِىٍّ: (TA, and so in a copy of the S in this art.:) or عَرْضَ <br>\
                  سَابِرِىٍّ. (O, TA, and so in a copy of the S in this art.) With this agrees in meaning the saying عَرَضَ عَلَىَّ سَوْمَ عَالَّةٍ [<i>He offered to me in the manner of offering</i> water <i>to camels taking a second draught:</i> see also arts. سوم and عل; and see Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 84]. (TA.) You say also, عَرَضْتُ الجَارِيَةَ عَلَى البَيْعِ [<i>I showed,</i> or <i>displayed,</i> or <i>exposed,</i> or <i>offered, the girl for sale</i>]: (S, O, TA:) and in like manner المَتَاعَ [<i>the commodity</i>]. (TA.) And عَرَضْتُ لَهُ ثَوْبًا <br>\
                  مَكَانَ حَقِّهِ; (S, O;) and عَرَضْتُ لَهُ مِنْ حَقِّهِ ثَوْبًا, (S, O, K,) or مَتَاعًا, (TA,) this meaning, [as also the former phrase,] <i>I gave to him a garment,</i> or <i>piece of cloth,</i> [or <i>a commodity,</i>] <i>in place of his due:</i> (S, O, K:) and in like manner, عرضت بِهِ. (El-Umawee, TA.) And عَرَضْتُ البَعِيرَ عَلَى <br>\
                  الحَوْضِ, which is an instance of inversion, meaning عَرَضْتُ الحَوْضَ عَلَى البَعِيرِ [<i>I showed the watering-trough to the camel</i>]: (S, O, Msb:) [or it agrees in meaning with the phrase] عَرَضَ النَّاقَةَ <br>\
                  عَلَى الحَوْضِ, and ↓ <br>\
      اَعْرَضَهَا, [as rendered] <i>He offered to the she-camel to drink</i> [<i>at the wateringtrough</i>]. (L, TA.) And عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى السَّيْفِ [lit. <i>He exposed them to the sword;</i> (see also 2;) meaning] <i>he slew them</i> (S, A, O, Msb, K) <i>with the sword.</i> (Msb.) And عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى السَّوْطِ <br>\
                  <i>He beat them with the whip; he flogged them.</i> (K, * TA.) And عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى النَّارِ <br>\
                  <i>He burned them.</i> (A, TA.) And عَرَضْتُ العَسَلَ عَلَى النَّارِ <br>\
                  <i>I cooked the honey</i> [<i>upon the fire</i>] to separate it from the wax. (Msb.) [And عَرَضَ نَفْسَهُ لِلْهَلَاكِ <br>\
                  <i>He exposed himself to destruction.</i>] ―         -b2-  عَرْضٌ also signifies The <i>bringing</i> a man <i>before a judge, and accusing</i> him. (IAar, in TA, art. عقب.) [And The <i>presenting,</i> or <i>addressing,</i> a petition, &amp;amp;c., with عَلَى or لِ before the word signifying the person to whom it is presented or addressed.] ―         -b3-  One says also, مَا يَعْرِضُكَ لِفُلَانٍ, (S, [so in two copies,] and O,) or مَا يَعْرُضَكَ, (L, TA,) with fet-h to the ى and damm to the ر, (L,) the verb being coordinate to نَصَرَ: (TA:) [app. meaning <i>What causeth thee to present thyself to such a one?</i>]: Yaakoob disallows one&#39;s saying ↓ <br>\
      مَا يُعَرِّضُكَ <br>\
                  لِفُلَانٍ, with teshdeed. (S, O, TA.) [But the latter of these two verbs has a signification nearly allied to that which is here assigned to the former, and exactly agreeing with one mentioned before. See 2.] ―         -b4-  عَرَضَ الجُنْدَ, (S, Msb,) and عَرَضَ الجُنْدَ <br>\
                  عَرْضَ العَيْنِ, (S, O,) or عَرْضَ عَيْنٍ, (A, K, B, except that in the A and B we find الجَيْشَ instead of الجند,) aor.      <br>\
