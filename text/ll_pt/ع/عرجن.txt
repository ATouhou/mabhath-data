                  <i>A raceme of a palm-tree,</i> or <i>of dates;</i> syn. عِذْقٌ: or, <i>when it has become dry and curved:</i> (K:) or the <i>base,</i> or <i>lower part,</i> (اَصْل, S, K, and also A and Mgh and Msb in art. عرج [because the ن is therein regarded as augmentative],) <i>of the</i> <br>\

                  كِبَاسَة: (Th, K:) Az says, it is yellow and broad: [but it is the contrary of broad in comparison with its length:] and in the Kur xxxvi. 39, the moon when it has become slender [in appearance, towards the end of the lunar month,] is likened to the old عُرْجُون, in respect, as ISd says, of its slenderness and curvature: (TA:) [in the TA voce سُبَاطَةٌ, the pl. عَرَاجِينُ is strangely used as meaning the <i>fruit-stalks</i> of the raceme of a palmtree:] بَنَاتُ عُرْجُونٍ signifies <i>the fruit-stalks of a raceme of dates:</i> (T in art. بنى:) [it is said that] the ن of عُرْجُونٌ, though this word imports the meaning of اِنْعِرَاجٌ [or “ a state of bending ”], is shown to be radical by the word مُعَرْجَنٌ, occurring in a verse of Ru-beh, and also by the fact that there is no verb of the measure فَعْلَنَ. (TA. [But عَشْرَنَ and سَبْعَنَ, though these are said to be post-classical, and, accord. to some, عَلْوَنَ, may be mentioned, and perhaps some other, as being of this measure.]) ―         -b2-  Also <i>A certain plant,</i> (K, TA,) <i>white,</i> accord. to Th, (TA,) <i>like the</i> <br>\
