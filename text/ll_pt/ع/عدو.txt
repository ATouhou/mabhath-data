                  , (Mgh, K,) first pers. عَدَوْتُهُ, (Msb,) aor. يَعْدُو, (Mgh, Msb,) [inf. n. عَدْوٌ,] <i>He passed from it,</i> (Mgh, Msb, K,) namely, a thing, or an affair, (K,) to another, (Mgh, Msb,) <i>and left it;</i> (K;) and عَدَا عَنْهُ signifies the same; (K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      تعدّاه; (S, * K;) and in like manner one says, ↓ <br>\
      عَدَّيْتُهُ, inf. n. تَعْدِيَةٌ; (Msb;) [but I do not find this elsewhere, and think that correctly one should say, عَنْهُ ↓ <br>\
      عَدَّيْتُ; agreeably with what here follows:] the saying عَنْ هٰذَا ↓ <br>\
      عَدِّ means <i>Leave thou this,</i> and <i>turn from it to another;</i> and is app. from the phrase هَمَّكَ ↓ <br>\
      عَدِّ <br>\
                  اـِلَى غَيْرِهِ [<i>Turn thy anxiety to other than him,</i> or <i>it</i>]; the objective complement being altogether left out, so that the verb becomes as though it were intrans.; and there are many instances similar to this in the language: (Har p. 478:) one says, عَنِّى الهَمَّ ↓ <br>\
      عَدَّيْتُ <br>\
                  <i>I turned away from me anxiety:</i> and [hence] you say to him who has pursued you, عَنِّى اـِلَى غَيْرِى ↓ <br>\
      عَدِّ, meaning <i>Turn thou</i> the beast upon which thou art riding <i>towards other than me:</i> (TA:) and عَمَّا تَرَى ↓ <br>\
      عَدِّ, meaning <i>Turn thou</i> thine eye <i>from what thou seest.</i> (S.) [See an ex. of the first of these verbs in the Ham p. 125.] One says also, عَدَاهُ الاَمْرُ and ↓ <br>\
      تعدّاهُ <br>\
                  <i>The thing,</i> or <i>affair, passed from him.</i> (TA. [See an ex. in the first paragraph of art. عدم.]) And the Arabs say, اـِنَّ الجَرَبَ <br>\
                  لَيَعْدُو, meaning <i>Verily the mange,</i> or <i>scab, passes</i> from him that has it to him that is near to him so that the latter becomes mangy, or scabby. (Msb.) And مَا عَدَا فُلَانٌ اَنْ صَنَعَ [app. meaning <i>Such a one did not leave,</i> or, accord. to an explanation of the verb in a similar phrase in Har p. 333, <i>did not delay, his doing</i> such a thing]. (S.) Accord. to Er-Rághib, العَدْوُ primarily signifies <i>Transition;</i> [whence what here precedes;] or <i>the going,</i> or <i>passing, beyond,</i> or <i>the exceeding,</i> a limit, or the usual limit: and <i>incompatibility to coalesce.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  And [hence,] عَدَاهُ, aor. as above, [inf. n. عَدْوٌ,] <i>He went,</i> or <i>passed, beyond it; exceeded it;</i> or <i>transgressed it.</i> (S, TA. *) So in the saying عَدَا طَوْرَهُ [<i>He went,</i> or <i>passed, beyond his proper limit; exceeded it;</i> or <i>transgressed it</i>]: and in like manner, الحَقَّ ↓ <br>\
      تعدّى and ↓ <br>\
      اعتداهُ signify <i>He went,</i> or <i>passed, beyond,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>what was true,</i> or <i>right;</i> and so عَنِ الحَقِّ, and فَوْقَ الحَقِّ. (TA.) اَمَا <br>\
                  عَدَا مَنْ بَدَا, a saying in which the vulgar erroneously omit the interrogative ا, means <i>Does not he transgress that which is right who begins</i> by acting injuriously? (TA.) And it is said عَدَا <br>\
                  القَارِصُ فَحَرَزَ (tropical:)  <i>What was biting to the tongue attained to an excessive degree, so that it became acid:</i> meaning that the affair, or case, became distressing. (S in art. قرص.) ―         -b3-  And عَدَا عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. عَدْوٌ and عَدَا=ءٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and عُدُوٌّ (S, Msb, K) and عُدْوَانٌ (ISd, Msb, K) and عِدْوَانٌ (ISd, K) and عُدْوَى; (K;) and ↓ <br>\
      تعدّى, and ↓ <br>\
      اعتدى; (S, Msb, K;) <i>He acted wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously,</i> or <i>tyrannically, against him;</i> (S, Msb, K;) and <i>transgressed against him,</i> or <i>exceeded the proper limit against him:</i> (S, Msb:) [and <i>he acted aggressively against him;</i> agreeably with an explanation of the inf. n. of the last of these verbs in what follows: (see an ex. in a verse cited voce رِيحٌ:)] or <i>he acted with excessive wrongfulness,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>against him:</i> (Mgh:) and ↓ <br>\
      اعدى signifies the same as the other verbs here mentioned; (K, TA;) whence (TA) one says, فِى مَنْطِقِكَ ↓ <br>\
      اَعْدَيْتَ <br>\
                  <i>Thou hast deviated from that which is right in thy speech:</i> (S, TA:) ↓ <br>\
      الاِعْتِدَا=ءُ is <i>the exceeding what is right;</i> and it is sometimes <i>in the way of aggression;</i> and sometimes <i>in the way of requital;</i> and instances of the usage of its verb in both of these manners occur in the Kur ii. 190: (Er-Rághib, TA:) the first and third of the inf. ns. of عَدَا, mentioned above, occur in the Kur vi. 108 accord. to different readings: (S, TA:) and [it is said that] العُدْوَانُ signifies <i>sheer,</i> or <i>unmixed, wrongful</i> or <i>unjust</i> or <i>injurious</i> or <i>tyrannical conduct:</i> (S:) or, as some say, <i>the worst of</i> [<i>such conduct,</i> i. e., <i>of</i>] الاِعْتِدَا=ء, <i>in strength,</i> or <i>deed,</i> or <i>state</i> or <i>condition.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  And عَدَا <br>\
                  عَلَيْهِ <br>\
                  <i>He acted corruptly towards him.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  And عُدِىَ عَلَيْهِ <br>\
                  <i>He had his property stolen, and was wronged.</i> (TA.) And عَدَا عَلَى القُمَاشِ, inf. n. عَدَا=ءٌ [said in the TA to be like سَحَابٌ, but in the CK عَدًا,] and عُدْوَانٌ and عَدَوَانٌ, (K, TA,) but in the M written with damm and fet-h [i. e. عُدْوَان and عَدْوَان], (TA,) said of a thief, <i>He stole the</i> <br>\
                  قماش [meaning <i>goods,</i> or <i>utensils and furniture</i>]. (K, TA.) And عَدَا فِى ظَهْرِهِ <br>\
                  <i>He stole what was behind him:</i> (A in art. ظهر:) [or <i>he acted wrongfully in respect of what was behind him:</i> for] لِصٌّ عَادِى ظَهْرٍ is expl. by the words عَدَا فِى ظَهْرٍ فَسَرَقَهُ [so that it app. means <i>A thief who has acted wrongfully in respect of what was behind one, and stolen it</i>]. (O and K in that art.) ―         -b6-  And عَدَا عَلَيْهِ, (K, TA,) inf. n. عَدْوٌ, (TA,) signifies also <i>He leaped upon him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (K, TA.) ―         -b7-  And عَدَا, (K,) or عَدَا فِى <br>\
                  مَشْيِهِ, (Msb,) aor. يَعْدُو, (Msb, K,) inf. n. عَدْوٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and عَدًا and عُدُوٌّ and عَدَوَانٌ and تَعْدَا=ءٌ, (K,) signifies اَحْضَرَ [i. e. <i>He ran;</i> or <i>rose in his running</i>]; (S, * K, TA;) said of a man and of a horse: (TA:) or <i>he went a pace nearly the same as that termed</i> <br>\
                  هَرْوَلَةٌ, (Msb, TA,) <i>not so quick,</i> (TA,) or <i>which is not so quick,</i> (Msb,) <i>as that termed</i> <br>\
                  جَرْىٌ: (Msb, TA:) or <i>he went a pace less quick than</i> <br>\
                  شَدٌّ <br>\
                  <i>and more so than</i> <br>\
                  مَشْىٌ: (TA in art. سعى:) or [<i>he went quickly,</i> or <i>swiftly;</i> for] العَدْوُ signifies السُّرْعَةُ: (Mgh:) [or rather <i>he ran,</i> whether <i>gently</i> or <i>moderately</i> or <i>vehemently:</i> that it often signifies <i>he ran vehemently</i> is shown by the prov. مِنْ سُلَيْكٍ ↓ <br>\
      اَعْدَى <br>\
                  <i>More vehement in running than Suleyk,</i> who is said to have outstripped fleet horses; and by numerous exs.:] and ↓ <br>\
      عّى signifies the same as عَدَا, denoting a quick pace. (TA in art. هبص.) ―         -b8-  And [hence, perhaps,] عَدَا المَا=ءُ, aor. يَعْدُو, (assumed tropical:)  <i>The water ran.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  عَدَاهُ عَنِ الاَمْرِ, (S, K,) inf. n. عَدْوٌ and عُدْوَانٌ; as also ↓ <br>\
      عدّاهُ; (K;) signifies <i>He,</i> or <i>it, diverted him;</i> or <i>turned him away,</i> or <i>back;</i> (S, K;) and <i>occupied him so as to divert him;</i> (K;) <i>from the thing,</i> or <i>affair.</i> (S, K.) You say, عَدَتْ عَوَادٍ. (S, TA. See عَادِيَةٌ, voce عُدَوَا=ءُ: and see also the last sentence of the first paragraph of art. عود.) ―         -b2-  عَدَانِى مِنْهُ <br>\
                  شَرٌّ means بَلَغَنِى [i. e., app., <i>Evil,</i> or <i>mischief, reached me from him,</i> or <i>it</i>]. (TA. [See a signi-  fication of 4.])       -A3-  عَدِيتُ لَهُ signifies <i>I hated him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (ISd, K.)       -A4-  عَدَا is also a verb by which one makes an exception, with مَا [preceding it] and without مَا: (S, K:) you say, جَا=ءَنِى <br>\
                  القَوْمُ مَا عَدَا زَيْدًا [<i>The people,</i> or <i>party, came to me, except Zeyd</i>]; and جَاوُونِى عَدَا زَيْدًا [which means the like]; putting what follows it in the accus. case; the agent being implied in it: (S: [see this expl. in what has been said of خَلَا as used in the same manner:]) accord. to MF, it is a verb when what follows it is put in the accus. case; and when what follows it is put in the gen. case, it is a particle, by common consent: (TA: [and the like is said in the Mughnee; i. e., that it is similar to خَلَا in respect of the explanations there given of the different usages of this latter; but that Sb did not know it to have been used otherwise than as having the quality of a verb:]) one says, رَاَيْتُهُمْ عَدَا اَخَاكَ and مَا عَدَاهُ, meaning مَا خَلَا [i. e. <i>I saw them, except thy brother</i>]: and sometimes it governs the gen. case without ما: thus in the M: Az says, [as though regarding it as only a particle,] when you suppress [ما], you make it to govern the accus. case as meaning اـِلَّا and you make it to govern the gen. case as meaning سِوَى.

(K.) ―         -b2-  Hence تَعْدِيَةُ الفِعْلِ, a phrase of the grammarians, [generally meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>The making the verb transitive,</i>] as in خَرَجَ زَيْدٌ فَاَخْرَجْتُهُ [<i>Zeyd went forth and I made him to go forth</i>].
