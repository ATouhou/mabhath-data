                  الدُّنْيَا وَلَا تَعْمُرُوهَا: but the reading given by Sgh and in the L is pronounced by MF to be the right. (TA.) See also عِبْرَةٌ. [And see 10, last sentence.] ―         -b2-  Also <i>He took,</i> or <i>regarded, what he witnessed,</i> or <i>saw,</i> or <i>beheld, as an indication,</i> or <i>evidence, of what was concealed from him:</i> (O:) <i>he compared what was unapparent with what was apparent</i> [<i>and so judged of the former from analogy</i>]: or <i>he considered the essential properties of things, and their modes of indication, in order that, by the consideration thereof, another thing, of their kind, might become known.</i> (Kull p. 60.) See, again, عِبْرَةٌ. Ibn-Seereen used to say, اَعْتَبِرُ الحَدِيثَ [<i>I judge by comparison with what has been transmitted by tradition</i> from the Prophet]; meaning I interpret a dream according to what has been transmitted by tradition, like as I do according to the Kur-án; as when a crow is interpreted as meaning an unrighteous man, and a rib as meaning a woman, in imitation of forms of speech used by the Prophet. (O, * TA.) ―         -b3-  See also 1, latter half, in two places. ―         -b4-  Also <i>He accounted,</i> or <i>esteemed,</i> or <i>regarded,</i> a thing, <i>in respect of predicamental order.</i> (Msb.)
