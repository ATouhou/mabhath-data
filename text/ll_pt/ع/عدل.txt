                  ذَوَىْ عَدْلٍ مِنْكُمْ, in the Kur [lxv. 2], is said by Sa&#39;eed Ibn-El-Museiyib to mean ذَوَىْ عَقْلٍ [i. e. <i>And make ye to be witnesses two persons of intelligence from among you:</i> but this rendering I think questionable]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  Also <i>Repayment, requital, compensation,</i> or <i>recompense.</i> (K.) ―         -b3-  And <i>Ransom,</i> (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) <i>when regard is had therein to the meaning of equality,</i> or <i>equivalence.</i> (TA.) This is [said to be] the meaning in the phrase of the Kur [v. 96], اَوْ عَدْلُ ذٰلِكَ صِيَامًا [<i>Or the ransom thereof by fasting:</i> but this is generally expl. as meaning <i>or the like thereof of fasting;</i> (see عِدْلٌ;) i. e., in lieu of feeding a number of poor men, one shall fast the like number of days].

(TA.) ―         -b2-  العَدْلُ as one of the names of God means <i>He whom desire does not cause to incline,</i> or <i>decline, so that he should deviate from the right course in judgment.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  And one says, هٰذَا عَدْلٌ <br>\
                  بَيْنَهُمَا, meaning <i>This is intermediate in quality between them two, not in the utmost degree of goodness nor in the extreme degree of badness.</i> (Mgh.)

      عَدْلٌ and عِدْلٌ are nearly the same; but the former is used in relation to what is perceived mentally, as in the phrase of the Kur [v. 96], اَوْ عَدْلُ ذٰلِكَ صِيَامًا [mentioned voce عَدْلٌ]; and عِدْلٌ and ↓ <br>\
      عَدِيلٌ, in relation to what is perceived by the sense, as things weighed and things numbered and things measured: Ibn-&#39;Ámir, however, read او عِدْلُ ذلك; and Ks and the people of El-Medeeneh, with fet-h [i. e. عَدْلُ]: (TA:) or عِدْلُ الشَّىْءِ, with kesr, signifies <i>the like of the thing in kind,</i> (Mgh, Msb,) or <i>in quantity,</i> or <i>measure,</i> or <i>the like,</i> (Msb,) or also <i>in quantity,</i> or <i>measure,</i> or <i>the like,</i> (Mgh,) and IF says, <i>in weight;</i> (Msb;) and ↓ <br>\
      عَدْلُهُ, with fet-h, (Mgh, Msb,) <i>its like,</i> (Mgh,) or <i>what will stand in its stead,</i> (Msb,) <i>of a thing different in kind,</i> (Mgh, Msb;) whence the phrase of the Kur اَوْ عَدْلُ ذٰلِكَ <br>\
                  صِيَامًا [mentioned above]; عَدْل being originally an inf. n.: (Msb:) Akh says, العِدْلُ, with kesr, signifies المِثْلُ; and ↓ <br>\
      العَدْلُ, with fet-h, is originally an inf. n., but is made a subst. to denote المِثْلُ in order to distinguish it from the عِدْل of goods or commodities [which will be expl. in what follows]: Fr says, العِدْلُ, with kesr, is <i>the like</i> (المِثْلُ), as in the saying عِنْدِى عِدْلُ غُلَامِكَ [<i>I have the like of thy boy</i> or <i>young man</i>] and عِدْلُ شَاتِكَ [<i>the like of thy sheep</i> or <i>goat</i>]; but you say ↓ <br>\
      العَدْلُ, with nasb [i. e. fet-h] to the ع, when you mean <i>the</i> [<i>equal in</i>] <i>value, of what is different in kind;</i> though sometimes it is pronounced with kesr by some of the Arabs, app. by an error on their part: (S, O:) or some allow one&#39;s saying عِنْدِى عِدْلُ غُلَامِكَ as meaning <i>I have the like of thy boy</i> or <i>young man,</i> [and app. ↓ <br>\
      عَدْلُهُ also,] and عَدْلُهُ with fet-h only as meaning <i>his value:</i> (TA:) but Zj says that العَدْلُ and العِدْلُ both signify <i>the like,</i> whether it be <i>of the same kind</i> or <i>of a different kind;</i> and if one make a mistake, he should not say that some of the Arabs have erred: (O:) the pl. (S, O, K) of عِدْلٌ, by common consent, (S, O,) is اَعْدَالٌ, (S, O, K,) and [that of ↓ <br>\
      عَدِيلٌ is] عُدَلَا=ءُ. (K.) ―         -b2-  Also The <i>half of a load,</i> (K, TA,) <i>such as is on either of the two sides of the camel;</i> (TA;) or <i>a burden</i> [<i>borne on one side of a beast, counterbalancing another on the other side,</i> or] <i>made equiponderant to another burden:</i> (Az, TA:) pl. [of pauc.] اَعْدَالٌ and [of mult.] عُدُولٌ: (Sb, K:) and ↓ <br>\
      عَدِيلٌ signifies the <i>equal</i> of a person <i>in weight and measure</i> or <i>size</i> or <i>the like</i> (S, K, * TA) in the [vehicle called] مَحْمِل: (TA:) Sb says that it signifies <i>a human being that is the equal</i> of another [<i>in weight</i>]; distinguishing it from عِدْلٌ, which, he says, is applied only to goods, or commodities: (IB, TA:) [but] ↓ <br>\
      عَدِيلَتَانِ signifies <i>two sacks</i> (غِرَارَتَانِ); because each counter balances, or is equiponderant to, the other. (TA.) Hence one says of the عُدُول of an evil judicial decision, مَا هُمْ عُدُولٌ وَلٰكِنْ عُدُولٌ [meaning <i>They are not witnesses whose testimony is approvable, but equalized loads of merchandise</i>]. (TA.) And [hence also] one says, وَقَعَ المُصْطَرِعَانِ عِدْلَىْ بَعِيرٍ, meaning <i>The two</i> [<i>men wrestling</i>] <i>fell together, neither of them having thrown down the other.</i> (TA.
