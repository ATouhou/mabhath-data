                  , inf. n. عَمَلٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) <i>He worked,</i> or <i>wrought; laboured; served,</i> or <i>did service: he did, acted,</i> or <i>performed:</i> (K, TA:) [generally, <i>he did,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>with a sort of difficulty,</i> or <i>with intention;</i> but sometimes said of an inanimate thing: (see عَمَلٌ, below:)] <i>he did,</i> or <i>he made, wrought, manufactured,</i> or <i>constructed,</i> a thing. (Msb. [See, again, عَمَلٌ, below.]) Accord. to Az, عَمِلَ is the only trans. verb of its measure having the inf. n. of the measure فَعَلٌ, except هَبِلَت, said of a mother, inf. n. هَبَلٌ; other similar verbs having the inf. n. of the measure فَعْلٌ; as سَرِطْتُ اللُّقْمَةَ, inf. n. سَرْطٌ; and بَلِعْتُهُ, inf. n. بَلْعٌ. (TA. [But see arts. سرط and بلع; with respect to the former of which I must here state that, since it was printed, I have found an authority for سَرْطٌ as inf. n. of سَرِطَ in a copy of the S; though in the K it is said to be مُحَرَّكَة, and accord. to the Msb it is like تَعَبٌ.]) You say, عَمِلْتُ عَلَى الصَّدَقَةِ <br>\

                  <i>It acted upon him,</i> or <i>it:</i> and, said of a sword &amp;amp;c., <i>it had effect,</i> or <i>made an impression, upon him,</i> or <i>it.</i>] ―         -b2-  [Hence,] عَمِلَ فِيهِ signifies [also (assumed tropical:)  <i>It governed it syntactically;</i> or <i>caused</i> it to be مَرْفُوع or مَنْصُوب or مَجْرُور &amp;amp;c.; i. e.] <i>it produced in it a certain species of syntactical desinence.</i> (K.) ―         -b3-  And عَمِلَ البَرْقُ <br>\

(TA.) And عَمِلَت [alone] said of a she-camel, signifies [the same: or] <i>She was,</i> or <i>became, brisk, light, active,</i> or <i>quick.</i> (K.) ―         -b4-  And [hence, app.,] لَمْ اَرَ النَّفَقَةَ تَعْمَلُ كَمَا تَعْمَلُ بِمَكَّةَ, a saying mentioned by Lh, is expl. by ISd as meaning تَنْفَقُ [i. e. <i>I have not seen the money that that one expends pass away as it passes away in Mekkeh</i>].

                  فِعْل [or <i>deed</i>] <i>with a sort of difficulty;</i> and therefore it is not attributed to God: or, accord. to Er-Rághib, it is <i>any</i> <br>\
                  فِعْل [i. e. <i>deed</i> or <i>action</i>] <i>that proceeds from an animate being by his intention;</i> and thus it has a more particular meaning than فِعْلٌ; for the فعل is sometimes attributed to animate beings from which it proceeds without intention; and sometimes to inanimate things, to which the عَمَل is seldom attributed; and this is not used in relation to [irrational] animals except [as implied] in the phrases اـِبِلٌ عَوَامِلُ and بَقَرٌ عَوَامِلُ: or, accord. to MF, the عَمَل is <i>a motion of the whole,</i> or <i>of a portion, of the body;</i> and sometimes, <i>of the mind;</i> so that it is <i>the utterance of a saying,</i> as well as <i>the doing a deed with the member,</i> or <i>limb, with which things are gained</i> or <i>earned;</i> though most readily understood as applied particularly to <i>the latter;</i> and some apply it particularly to <i>that which is not a saying:</i> it is also said that a saying is not termed عَمَلٌ in the common conventional language: and the truth is said to be, that it is not included in the terms عَمَلٌ and فِعْلٌ otherwise than tropically: (TA:) [see also عَمِلَةٌ:] the pl. of عَمَلٌ [used as a simple subst.] is اَعْمَالٌ.
