                   The <i>place of the collar</i> (S, O, L, K) of a horse. (S, O, L.) [App. so called because it is a place where charms, or amulets, are often suspended.] And المُعَوَّذُ, (A&#39;Obeyd, L,) or دَايِرَةُ <br>\
                  المُعَوَّذِ, (S, O, L,) <i>The feather,</i> or <i>curling portion of the coat of a horse, that is in the place of the collar:</i> (A&#39;Obeyd, L:) it is a دايرة approved. (A&#39;Obeyd, S, O, L.) ―         -b2-  Also, (accord. to the K,) or ↓ <br>\
      مُعَوِّذٌ, (accord. to the O,) A she-camel <i>that does not cease to remain in one place.</i> (O, K.) [SM says that the word thus expl. in the K is a mistranscription for معوّد; by which he means مُعَوِّد, part. n. of عَوَّدَ said of a camel; but this I doubt; for مُعَوِّدٌ has not the meaning here assigned to معوّذ.] ―         -b3-  See also عُوَّذٌ, in four places.    </entryFree> <br>\

(Msb.) And المُعَوِّذَاتُ is sometimes used to denote <i>The two chapters above mentioned together with that which next precedes them.</i> (MF.)    </entryFree> <br>\
