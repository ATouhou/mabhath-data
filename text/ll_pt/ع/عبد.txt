      عِبِدَّى signifies <i>a number of slaves born in a state of slavery, generation after generation;</i> but Az says that this is a mistake, that عِبِدَّى اْللّٰهِ signifies the same as عبَادُ اْللّٰهِ, that it is thus used in a trad., and that عِبِدَّى is applied in another trad. to poor men of the class called اَهْلُ الصُّفَّة; (L;) and ↓ <br>\
