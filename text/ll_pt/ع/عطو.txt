                  اـِيتا=ءٌ; but several authors make a distinction between these two words, saying that the latter is sometimes obligatory and sometimes by way of favour, whereas the former is never but by way of sheer favour; as El-Fakhr Er-Rázee says; though most of the leading lexicologists know not this distinction. (MF, TA.) One says, اَعْطَاهُ الشَّىْءَ; and اـِيَّاهُ ↓ <br>\
      عَاطَاهُ, inf. n. مُعَاطَاةٌ and عِطَا=ءٌ; <i>He gave him,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>the thing.</i> (TA.) And اعطاهُ مَالًا [<i>He gave him,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>property</i>]. (S.) And اَعْطَيْتُهُ دِرْهَمًا <br>\
                  <i>I gave him,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>a dirhem.</i> (Msb.) And as the signification of this verb does not depend upon the condition of taking, or receiving, but only upon giving, or delivering, one may say, اَعْطَيْتُهُ فَمَا اَخَذَ [<i>I gave,</i> or <i>delivered,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>to him, and he did not take,</i> or <i>receive</i>]. (Msb.) [See also a verse cited in the first paragraph of art. رام, in which this verb has a single objective complement with بِ redundantly prefixed to it.] ―         -b2-  اعطى, (S,) inf. n. as above, (K,) signifies also (tropical:)  <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, tractable, manageable,</i> or <i>submissive;</i> (S, K, TA;) said of a camel: (S:) and اعطى بِيَدِهِ [lit. <i>he gave his hand,</i> said of a man,] signifies the same: accord. to Er-Rághib, اعطى, said of a camel, primarily signifies <i>he gave his head, and did not resist.</i> (TA.) [Hence,] one says to a tractable camel, when his haltering becomes loosed (lit. opened) from his muzzle, اَعْطِ [meaning <i>Give thy head</i>]; whereupon he bends his head towards his rider, and he renews his haltering. (TA.) ―         -b3-   <br>\
                  مَا اَعْطَاهُ لِلْمَالِ [<i>How large a giver is he of property!</i>] is like the phrase مَا اَوْلَاهُ لِلْمَعْرُوفِ, and مَا اَكْرَمَهُ لِى; anomalous, because the verb of wonder is not formed from the measure اَفْعَلَ, and only what has been heard, of this kind, from the Arabs, is allowable.
