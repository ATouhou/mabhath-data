                  عُودٌ [as meaning <i>A staff,</i> or <i>stick,</i> or <i>rod</i>]: (K:) originally عَصَوٌ, and accordingly its dual is as below: said to be thus called because the fingers and hand are put together upon it [to grasp it], from the saying عَصَوْتُ القَوْمَ “ I collected together the people, or party; ” as related by As from some one or more of the Basrees: (TA:) of the fem. gender: (S, Msb, K:) it is said in a prov., ↓ <br>\
      العَصَا مِنَ العُصَيَّةِ [lit. <i>The staff is from the little staff;</i> the dim. having the affix ة because it is the dim. of a fem. n.]; (S;) [or] العَصَا in this prov. is the name of a mare of Jedheemeh [mentioned voce ضُلٌّ], and العُصَيَّة is that of her dam; meaning that part of the thing, or affair, is from part; (S, K, TA;) and said when one is likened to his father; or meaning that the big thing is in its commencement small: (TA: [see also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i. 17:]) it is not allowable to say عَصَا=ء; nor to affix ة: (As, TA:) one says, هٰذِهِ عَصَاىَ اَتَوَكَّاُ عَلَيْهَا [<i>This is my staff; I support,</i> or <i>stay, myself upon it</i>]: Fr says that the first incorrect speech heard in El-&#39;Irák was the saying, هٰذِهِ عَصَاتِى: (S:) the dual is عَصَوَانِ: (S, Msb:) and the pl. [of mult.] is عُصِىٌّ, (S, Msb, K,) [originally عُصُووٌ,] of the measure فُعُولٌ, (S, Msb,) and عِصِىٌّ, (S, K,) in which the ع is with kesr because of the kesrah following it, and [of pauc.] اَعْصٍ (S, Msb, K) and اَعْصَا=ءٌ, (K,) or this last is agreeable with analogy, but has not been transmitted, (ISk, Msb,) and is disallowed by Sb, who says that عُِصِىٌّ was used in its stead. (TA.) ―         -b2-  [Hence various sayings, here following. ―         -b3- ] اَلْقَى عَصَاهُ [lit. <i>He threw down his staff;</i>] meaning (tropical:)  <i>he stayed,</i> (S, Msb, K, TA,) and <i>rested,</i> (Msb,) and <i>ceased from journeys,</i> (S,) <i>having reached his place:</i> (K, TA:) a prov.; (S, TA;) applied to him to whom an affair has become suitable and who has therefore kept to it: (TA:) or <i>he made firm his tent-pegs, and pitched his tent,</i> or <i>stayed;</i> (K, TA;) like him who has returned from his journey. (TA.) And رَفَعَ عَصَاهُ [<i>He took up his staff</i>] means (assumed tropical:)  <i>he ceased from staying</i> [<i>in a place at which he had alighted; he departed</i>]. (Har p. 454.) ―         -b4-  لَا تَرْفَعْ عَصَاكَ عَنْ اَهْلِكَ [<i>Put not thou away thy staff,</i> or <i>stick, from thy family,</i> or <i>thy wife,</i>] denotes [the practice of] discipline. (S. [See art. رفع, p. 1122, col. 3.]) ―         -b5-  هُمْ عَبِيدُ <br>\
                  العَصَا [<i>They are the slaves of the staff</i>] means (assumed tropical:)  <i>they are</i> [<i>persons</i>] <i>beaten with the staff.</i> (K, TA.) It is said in the A, النَّاسُ عَبِيدُ العَصَا [<i>Mankind are the slaves of the staff</i>], meaning that they are dreaded by reason of their doing harm [and are therefore to be kept in awe]. (TA.) ―         -b6-  And مَا هُمْ اـِلَّا عَبِيدُ العَصَا [<i>They are none other than the slaves of the staff</i>] is said of persons regarded as low, base, or vile. (TA.) ―         -b7-  اـِنَّهُ لَيِّنُ العَصَا [<i>Verily he is one whose staff is supple</i>] means (tropical:)  <i>he is gentle, a good manager of that whereof he has the charge:</i> (S, K: *) accord. to ISd, alluding to the beating little with the عصا. (TA.) And اـِنَّهُ ضَعِيفُ العَصَا [<i>Verily he is one whose staff is weak</i>], meaning تِرْعِيَّةٌ [i. e., (assumed tropical:)  <i>one who performs well the act of keeping</i> or <i>tending,</i> or <i>of pasturing</i> or <i>feeding, camels</i>]: (S:) or <i>one who beats the camels little</i> (K, TA) <i>with the</i> <br>\

                  عصا: and such is discommended. (TA.)

Prov. i. 153;) or] <i>enter not thou into that which does not concern thee.</i> (TA.) And قَشَرْتُ لَهُ العَصَا [<i>I peeled for him the staff</i>] means (assumed tropical:)  <i>I discovered to him what was in my mind.</i> (TA.) ―         -b12-  شَقُّ العَصَا [lit. <i>The splitting of the staff</i>] means (assumed tropical:)  <i>the contravening of the collective body</i> [or <i>the community</i>] <i>of El-Islám</i> [i. e. <i>of the Muslims</i>]: (K, TA:) and also (assumed tropical:)  <i>the disuniting of the collective body of the tribe:</i> (TA:) or شَقَّ العَصَا means (tropical:)  <i>He separated himself from,</i> and <i>he contravened, the collective body</i> [or <i>the community</i>]: (Msb:) and [it is said that] the primary signification of العَصَا is <i>the state of combination and union:</i> (TA:) this is the meaning in the saying, respecting the خَوَارِج [see خارِجِىٌّ], قَدْ شَقُّوا عَصَا المُسْلِمِينَ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>They have made a schism in the state of combination and union,</i> or <i>in the communion, of the Muslims</i>]. (S, TA.) [Hence,] their saying اـِيَّاكَ وَقَتْلَ العَصَا means (assumed tropical:)  <i>Beware thou of slaying</i> or <i>being slain in making a schism in the communion of the Muslims</i> (فِى شَقِّ عَصَا المُسْلِمِينَ). (TA.) And one says, اِنْشَقَّتِ العَصَا (S, TA) [<i>The staff became split</i>], meaning, (assumed tropical:)  <i>disagreement,</i> or <i>discord, befell.</i> (TA.) And طَارَتْ عَصَا بَنِى فُلَانٍ شِقَقًا [lit. <i>The staff of the sons of such a one flew in splinters</i>], a prov., meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>the sons of such a one became scattered in various directions.</i> (Meyd.) ―         -b13-  عَصَا العَبْدِ [<i>The stick of the slave</i>] is <i>the thing with which one stirs the</i> <br>\
