                     عَضِبَ<br>\
                  , (Msb, K,) inf. n. عَضْبٌ, (S, A, O, &amp;amp;c.,) <i>He cut,</i> or <i>cut off, him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (S, A, * Mgh, * O, Msb, K.) مَا لَهُ <br>\
                  عَضَبَهُ اْللّٰهُ, meaning [<i>What aileth him?</i>] <i>may God cut off</i> (O, TA) <i>his arm and his leg,</i> or <i>his hand and his foot,</i> (O,) <i>or his arms and his legs,</i> or <i>his hands and his feet,</i> is a form of imprecation used by the Arabs. (TA.) And hence, (O,) one says, اـِنَّ الحَاجَةَ لَيَعْضِبُهَا طَلَبُهَا قَبْلَ وَقْتِهَا (assumed tropical:)  <i>Verily the seeking of the object of want before its time assuredly cuts it off,</i> or <i>precludes it, and mars it:</i> a prov. (O, TA.) And اـِنَّكَ لَتَعْضِبُنِى عَنْ حَاجَتِى (assumed tropical:)  <i>Verily thou cuttest me off from</i> [<i>the attainment of</i>] <i>the object of my want.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  And [hence] (assumed tropical:)  <i>He reviled him;</i> (A, * K;) and (A) so عَضَبَهُ بِلِسَانِهِ. (S, A, O.) ―         -b3-  And <i>He beat him,</i> or <i>struck him,</i> (O, K,) with a staff, or stick. (O.) ―         -b4-  And <i>He thrust him,</i> or <i>pierced him,</i> (K,) with a spear. (TK.) [But in the O and TA, عَضَبْتُهُ بِالرُّمْحِ is expl. by the words هُوَ اَنْ تَشْغَلَهُ <br>\
                  عَنْهُ; and the meaning app. is, <i>I occupied him so as to divert him with the spear;</i> though this meaning would be expressed more agreeably with usage by saying هو ان يشغله عنه; or rather هو <br>\
                  ان تَشْغَلَهُ عَنْكَ, which, I think, is the right reading.] ―         -b5-  And <i>It</i> (disease, O) <i>rendered him weak,</i> or <i>infirm:</i> (S, O:) and (O) <i>deprived him of the power of motion.</i> (A, * O, K.) You say, عَضَبَتْهُ <br>\
                  الزَّمَانَةُ, aor. as above, (O, TA,) and so the inf. n., (TA,) meaning [<i>Disease of long continuance,</i> or <i>want of some one or more of the limbs,</i>] <i>deprived him of the power of motion:</i> and AHeyth says, it [in the O هُوَ (so that it does not refer to الزمانة), and in the TA العضب,] is الشَّلَلُ and الخَبْلُ and العَرَجُ [<i>a state of privation of the power of motion,</i> and <i>unsoundness,</i> and <i>lameness;</i> app. meaning that these are the effects denoted by the phrase عضبته الزمانة]. (O, TA.) ―         -b6-  See also 4.       -A2-  عَضَبَ, (O, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (K,) signifies also <i>He returned</i> (O, K) عَلَيْهِ [<i>against him</i>].

                     عَضَبَ<br>\
                  , (Msb, K,) inf. n. عَضَبٌ, (S, O, Msb,) <i>He,</i> or <i>she, had the inner</i> [<i>part of the</i>] <i>horn broken:</i> (S, O, Msb, K:) or <i>had one of the horns broken.</i> (S, O, Msb.) ―         -b2-  العَضَبُ is mostly used in relation to the horn: but sometimes, in relation to the ear: (A &#39;Obeyd, TA:) one says of a شاة [expl. above], and of a she-camel, عَضِبَت, inf. n. عَضَبٌ, meaning <i>He,</i> or <i>she, had her ear slit,</i> or <i>had a slit ear:</i> (Msb:) [or <i>had half,</i> or <i>a third, of the ear cut off;</i> for] accord. to IAar, العَضَبُ in relation to the ear is when half, or a third, thereof has <i>gone.</i> (O.)       -A4-  عَضُبَ, aor.      <br>\
                     عَضُبَ<br>\
