                     ذ<br>\
                  , aor. يَعْوِى, inf. n. عُوَا=ءٌ (S, K, TA) and عَىٌّ and عَوَّةٌ (K, TA) and عَوْيَةٌ, with fet-h and then sukoon, thus in the M, but in the copies of the K عَوِيَّةٌ, (TA,) said of a dog, (S, CK, TA,) and of a wolf, and of a jackal, (S, TA,) <i>He cried,</i> or <i>cried loudly:</i> (S:) [meaning <i>he howled:</i>] <i>he twisted his muzzle, then uttered a cry:</i> or <i>he prolonged his cry, not doing so with clearness:</i> and ↓ <br>\
      اعتوى signifies the same: (K, TA:) [in the Ham p. 693, the former is expl. as signifying نَبَحَ and صَاحَ; but] it is said that عَوَّةٌ signifies a prolonged crying; and is not the same as نَبْحٌ [which means “ a barking ”]. (TA.) It is said in a prov. لَوْ لَكَ اَعْوِى مَا عَوَيْتُ [<i>If to thee I were howling, I had not howled</i>]; (TA;) or لَوْ لَكَ <br>\
                  عَوَيْتُ لَمْ اَعْوِهْ, in which the ه may be the ه of pausation, or it may be put by metonymy for the inf. n. so that the meaning is لَمْ اَعْوِ العُوَا=ءَ: (Meyd:) it originated from the fact that a man used, [and still uses, as I have had occasion to do,] when becoming benighted, in the desert, to howl, in order that the dogs, if any person by whose presence he might be cheered were near him, might hear, and reply to him, and he might be guided by their howling: so this man howled, and the wolf came to him, whereupon he said thus: it relates to the seeker of succour from him who will not succour him. (Meyd, * TA.) And it is said in a trad., كَاَنِّى اَسْمَعُ عُوَا=ءَ اَهْلِ <br>\
                  النَّارِ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [<i>As though I heard</i>] <i>the crying</i> or <i>loud crying</i> [or <i>howling</i>] <i>of the people of the fire</i> [of Hell]: (TA:) [for] عَوَىَ is used metaphorically as meaning <i>he suffered distress, and complained;</i> from the عُوَا=ء of the dog: (Har p. 634:) as IAth says, it is more especially used in relation to the wolf and the dog. (TA.) And one says of him who is esteemed, or found to be, weak, مَا يَعْوِى <br>\
                  وَمَا يَنْبَحُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He does not howl nor does he bark</i>]. (Ham p. 693.) ―         -b2-  And عَوَى اـِلَى الفِتْنَةِ means (assumed tropical:)  <i>He called</i> (K, TA) people, or a party, (TA,) [<i>to conflict and faction,</i> or <i>the like;</i>] عَوَى being used in this sense by way of likening the person who does so to a dog, or in contempt of him. (Ham p. 693.) [See also 10.] ―         -b3-  عُوَا=ءٌ signifies also The <i>grumbling cry</i> (رُغَا=ء) of a weak young camel: used in this sense by a poet. (TA.) ―         -b4-  عُوَا=ءُ المُغْتَابِ; and the phrase عَوَى عَنِ الرَّجُلِ; see in the next paragraph.       -A2-  عَوَى, (S, K, TA,) inf. n. عَىٌّ, (S, TA,) <i>He bent</i> a thing; as also ↓ <br>\
      اعتوى; and likewise a bow; as also ↓ <br>\
      عوّى, (K, TA,) inf. n. تَعْوِيَةٌ: (TA:) and (TA) <i>he twisted</i> hair, and a rope; (S, TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
      عوّى, inf. n. تَعْوِيَةٌ. (S.) One says also عَوَى العِمَامَةَ <br>\
                  عَيَّةً <br>\
                  <i>He twisted the turban with a single twisting.</i> (TA.) And عَوَيْتُ رَاْسَ النَّاقَةِ <br>\
                  <i>I turned the head of the she-camel by means of the nose-rein.</i> (S, TA.) And القَوْمُ صُدُورَ رِكَابهِمْ ↓ <br>\
      عوّى and عَوَوْهَا <br>\
                  <i>The party inclined the breasts of their camels that they were riding.</i> (TA.) And عَوَى البُرَةَ <br>\
                  <i>He bent,</i> or <i>inclined, the nose-ring</i> of the she-camel. (K, * TA.) And النَّاقَةُ تَعْوِى بُرَتَهَا فِى سَيْرِهَا <br>\
                  <i>The she-camel twists her nose-ring with her</i> <br>\
                  خِطَام [or <i>halter</i>] <i>in her going.</i> (S, TA.) And عَوَاهُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ <br>\
                  <i>He turned him from the thing.</i> (TA.) And one says of the man who possesses prudence, or discretion, and precaution, or good judgment, and who is hardy, strong, or sturdy, ما ينهى ولا يعوى [i. e. مَا يُنْهَى وَلَا يُعْوَى <br>\
                  <i>He is not forbidden nor is he turned</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  And عَوَى signifies also <i>He</i> (a man) <i>attained to the age of thirty years, so that his arm,</i> or <i>hand, became strong, and he twisted vehemently the arm,</i> or <i>hand, of another.</i> (ISd, K.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                  , thus in the M, with tesh-deed in the case of عوى and also in the case of كذب in the explanation; but in the K, ↓ <br>\
      عَوَى [without teshdeed]; (TA;) (assumed tropical:)  <i>He repelled from the man,</i> or <i>defended him;</i> syn. كَذَّبَ, and رَدَّ: (M, K, TA:) in the S is said the like of what is said in the M; عَوَّيْتُ عَنِ الرَّجُلِ being expl. in the S as meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>I repelled from,</i> or <i>defended, the man</i> (كذّبت عنه), <i>and replied against his backbiter</i> or <i>censurer</i> (رَدَدْت عَلَى مُغْتَابِهِ): and in the A, this phrase is said to be metaphorical, and expl. as meaning (tropical:)  <i>I repelled from the man the clamouring</i> [or, as we say, <i>the barking</i>] <i>of the backbiter</i> or <i>the censurer</i> (المُغْتَابِ ↓ <br>\
      رَدَدْت عَنْهُ عُوَا=ءَ): thus all these three are express authorities for the teshdeed. (TA.) [Freytag has represented the phrase in the S as agreeing with the reading thereof in the K, and has strangely expl. the verb with عن following it as meaning “ Mendacii arguit et refellit.”]       -A2-  See also 1, latter half, in three places.    </entryFree> <br>\
