                  , (K,) inf. n. عَصْبٌ, (S, A, Mgh, O, K,) <i>He twisted</i> [a thing], or <i>wound</i> [it] <i>round:</i> (A, K, TA:) this is the primary signification: (TA:) and <i>he folded</i> [it]; (A, K;) or <i>he folded</i> [it] <i>tightly:</i> (S, O, TA:) and <i>he bound</i> [it], or <i>tied</i> [it]: (A, Mgh, K, TA:) عَصْبٌ denotes the <i>binding,</i> or <i>tying,</i> a thing with another thing, <i>lengthwise,</i> or [more commonly] <i>around.</i> (O.) See also 2, first sentence. [And see مَعْصُوبٌ.] ―         -b2-  <i>He twisted,</i> or <i>spun,</i> thread. (K, * TA.) And <i>He put together</i> thread, <i>and bound</i> it, previously to dyeing it. (TA.) ―         -b3-  عَصَبَ <br>\
                  الكَبْشَ, (S, O, Msb, K, *] aor. as above, (K,) and so the inf. n., (S, Msb, K,) <i>He bound,</i> or <i>tied,</i> (<i>tightly,</i> TA) <i>the testicles of the ram, in order that they might fall, without his extracting them:</i> (S, O, Msb, K:) and in like manner one says of a goat, (K,) and of other beasts. (TA.) ―         -b4-  عَصَبَ <br>\
                  النَّاقَةَ, (O, Msb, K, *) aor. as above, (K,) and so the inf. n., (Msb, K, TA,) and عِصَابٌ also; (TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      اعتصبها; (O, K;) <i>He bound the thighs of the she-camel,</i> (Msb, K, TA,) or <i>the lower parts of her nostrils,</i> (TA,) <i>with a cord,</i> (Msb, TA,) in order that she might yield her milk copiously: (Msb, K, TA:) and (O) عَصَبَ <br>\
                  فَخِذَ النَّاقَةِ [<i>He bound the thigh of the she-camel</i>] for that purpose. (S, O.) [See عَصُوبٌ.] Hence one says, اَعْطَى عَلَى العَصْبِ (tropical:)  <i>He gave by means of force.</i> (TA.) And مِثْلِى لَا يَدِرُّ بِالعِصَابِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Such a one as I am will not give by means of force.</i> (A, TA.) ―         -b5-  عَصَبَتْ فَرْجَهَا <br>\
                  <i>She</i> (a woman) <i>bound her vulva with a bandage.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b6-  عَصَبَ الشَّجَرَةَ, (S, O, K,) aor.      <br>\
                     عَصِبَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. عَصْبٌ, (K,) <i>He drew together the branches of the tree</i> (S, O, K, TA) <i>that were straggling,</i> (K, TA,) <i>by means of a rope,</i> (TA,) <i>and then beat it,</i> (S, O, K, TA,) in order that its leaves might fall. (S, O, TA.) [Golius assigns this signification also to عَصَّبَ, as on the authority of the S, in which I do not find it.] El-Hajjáj said, (S, TA,) when preaching to the people at El-Koofeh, (TA,) لَاَعْصِبَنَّكُمْ <br>\
                  عَصْبَ السَّلَمِ (S) or السَّلَمَةِ (TA) [<i>I will assuredly draw you together and beat you as one does the selem</i> or <i>the selemeh</i>]. The سَلَمَة is a tree of the kind called عِضَاه, having thorns, and its leaves are the قَرَظ with which hides are tanned: [but see قَرَظٌ:] the removal of the leaves with the hand being difficult on account of the many thorns, its branches are drawn together and bound tightly with a rope; then the beater pulls them towards him, and beats them with his staff; whereupon the leaves become scattered for the cattle and for him who desires to gather them. (TA.) Or this is done, (S, O, TA,) accord. to A &#39;Obeyd, (S, O,) only (TA) when they desire to cut down the selemeh, that they may get at the stock. (S, O, TA.) [Hence,] one says, فُلَانٌ لَا تُعْصَبُ سَلَمَاتُهُ [<i>Such a one will not have his selemehs bound round with a rope, and beaten</i>]: a prov., applied to a strong, mighty man, not to be subdued nor abased. (A, * TA.) And one says also of winds, تَعْصِبُ الشَّجَرَ عِنْدَ دُرُوجِهَا فِيهِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>They compress the branches of the trees, as though they bound them round, in their passage among them</i>]: and such winds are termed ↓ <br>\
      عَصَايِبُ. (O.) And عَصَبَ القَوْمَ, aor.      <br>\
                     عَصِبَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. عَصْبٌ, (assumed tropical:)  <i>It</i> (an affair, or event,) <i>drew the people together, and became severe to them.</i> (Az, TA.) ―         -b7-  عَصَبَ صَدْعَ الزُجَاجَةِ بِضَبَّةٍ مِنْ فِضَّةٍ <br>\
                  <i>He</i> (a smith) <i>repaired the crack of the glass vessel by putting round it a band of silver.</i> (O, TA.) ―         -b8-  عَصَبَ بِرَاْسِ قَوْمِهِ العَارَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He made disgrace to befall his people</i> [<i>as though he bound it upon the head of their chief</i> or <i>upon the head of each of them</i>]. (O.) It is related in a trad. respecting the battle of Bedr, that &#39;Otbeh the son of Rabee&#39;ah said, اِرْجِعُوا وَلَا تُقَاتِلُوا وَاْعْصِبُوهَا بِرَاْسِى (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Return ye, and fight not; and bind it upon my head</i>]; meaning attach and attribute to me the disgrace that will befall you for relinquishing the battle and inclining to peace. (IAth, TA.) And it is said in another trad., قُومُوا بِمَا عَصَبَكُمْ بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Fulfil ye the obligations with which He</i> (meaning God) <i>has bound you;</i> or <i>which He has imposed upon you and attached to you;</i> by his commands and prohibitions. (TA.) ―         -b9-  عَصَبَ الشَّىْءَ and عَلَى <br>\
                  الشَّىْءِ, aor.      <br>\
                     عَصِبَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. عَصْبٌ and عِصَابٌ, <i>He grasped the thing with his hand.</i> (K, * TA.) A poet, cited by IAar, says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَكُنَّا يَا قُرَيْشُ اـِذَا عَصَبْنَا<br>\

                        يَجِىْءُ عِصَابُنَا بِدَمٍ عَبِيطِ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>And we were, O Kureysh, when we grasped</i> our opponents, <i>such that our grasping brought fresh blood</i>]; عِصَابُنَا meaning <i>our grasping</i> those whom we opposed with the swords. (TA.) ―         -b10-  And عَصَبَ, aor.      <br>\
                     عَصِبَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. عَصْبٌ, <i>He clung,</i> or <i>kept, to</i> a thing. (K.) One says, عَصَبَ المَا=ءَ <br>\
                  <i>He kept to,</i> or <i>by, the water.</i> (IAar, TA.) And عَصَبَ الرَّجُلُ <br>\
                  بَيْتَهُ <br>\
                  <i>The man remained,</i> or <i>stayed, in his house,</i> or <i>tent, not quitting it.</i> (O, TA.) ―         -b11-  And <i>He went round, encompassed,</i> or <i>surrounded,</i> a thing. (K.) It is said in a trad., of the angel Gabriel, on the day of Bedr, قَدْ عَصَبَ رَاْسَهُ الغُبَارُ <br>\
                  <i>The dust had overspread,</i> [or <i>surrounded,</i>] <i>and clung to, his head:</i> or, as some relate it, قَدْ عَصَمَ ثَنِيَّتَيْهِ <br>\
                  الغُبَارُ; and if this be not a mistake, the latter verb is syn. with the former: ب and م being often interchangeable: (L, TA:) the latter phrase means, as also with عَصَبَ, <i>the dust had stuck to his two central incisors.</i> (TA in art. عصم.) And Ibn Ahmar says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        اـِذْ عَصَبَ النَّاسَ شَمَالٌ وَقُرٌ<br>\
                  </quote> [وَقُرْ being for وَقُرٌّ] i. e. <i>When north wind and cold environ me.</i> (L, TA.) And one says also, عَصَبَ الغُبَارُ بِالجَبَلِ <br>\
                  <i>The dust encompassed,</i> or <i>surrounded, the mountain.</i> (L, TA.) And عَصَبُوا بِهِ <br>\
                  <i>They encompassed,</i> or <i>surrounded, him:</i> (S, A, Mgh, O, TA:) and <i>they encompassed,</i> or <i>surrounded, him, looking at him:</i> (S, O:) and, (Msb, K,) as also عَصِبُوا, (K,) aor. of the former      <br>\
                     عَصِبَ<br>\

                  , (K,) <i>they assembled around him</i> (Msb, K) <i>for fight</i> or <i>defence.</i> (Msb. For another explanation of عَصَبَ and عَصِبَ, see 12.) And عَصَبَ القَوْمُ بِالنَّسَبِ <br>\
                  <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  اَحَاطُوا بِهِ [app. meaning <i>The people,</i> or <i>party, included,</i> or <i>comprehended, the relations,</i> or <i>kinsmen;</i> for النَّسَبُ is often used for ذَوُو النَّسَبِ]. (Msb.) And عَصَبَتِ الاـِبِلُ بِالمَا=ءِ <br>\
                  <i>The camels surrounded,</i> or <i>encircled, the water.</i> (S, O.) ―         -b12-  عَصَبَ الرِّيقُ بِفِيهِ, (S, O, K, * TA,) aor.      <br>\

(L, TA.) <i>He turbaned</i> a man; <i>attired</i> him <i>with a turban.</i> (A, TA.) ―         -b2-  Hence, (A, O,) تَعْصِيبٌ signifies (tropical:)  [The <i>crowning</i> a man: (see the pass. part. n.:)] the <i>making</i> a man <i>a chief:</i> (A, O, K, TA:) for turbans are the crowns of the Arabs: (O:) when a man&#39;s people made him a chief, they bound his head with a turban: (A, TA:) as kings wore crowns, so the chiefs of the Arabs wore red turbans: (L, TA:) there were brought to the desert, from Haráh (هَرَاة), red turbans, which the nobles among the Arabs wore.
