      عِضَةٌ is originally عِضَهَةٌ, the deficient [radical] letter being ه; (S, * TA;) for عِضَةٌ and عِضُونَ in the dial. of Kureysh signify <i>enchantment</i> [and <i>enchantments</i>], and they term the enchanter عَاضِهٌ: (S:) or, as some say, the deficient [radical] letter is و, (S, TA,) from عَضَوْتُهُ meaning فَرَّقْتُهُ, (S,) or from عَضَّيْتُ الشَّىْءَ <br>\
                   meaning فَرَّقْتُهُ; (TA;) because they divided their sayings respecting the Kur-án, pronouncing it to be falsehood, or enchantment, or divination, or poetry. (S, TA.) And one says, ↓ <br>\
      يَالِلْعَضِيهَةِ, with kesr to the ل, [<i>O the lie?</i>] denoting a calling to aid; (S;) or said on an occasion of wondering at a great lie; and with fet-h to the ل [i. e. يَا لَلْعَضِيهَةِ] denoting a calling for aid. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
