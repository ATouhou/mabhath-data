      يُعَرِّبُ, (Mgh, O,) so accord. to A &#39;Obeyd, but, as IAmb says, both are dial. vars. of which neither is preferable to the other; and the meaning is [<i>she who has become a widow,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>her tongue</i>] <i>shall declare for her.</i> (O.) One says also, اعرب عَنِ الرَّجُلِ <br>\
                  <i>He spoke out,</i> or <i>explained, for the man.</i> (TA.) And عَنِ القَوْمِ ↓ <br>\

      عَرَب, from this word as inf. n. of عَرِبَ used in relation to the stomach &amp;amp;c.,] i. e. <i>vagueness.</i> (Msb.) And اعرب كَلَامَهُ <br>\
                  <i>He made his speech free from error,</i> or <i>incorrectness, in</i> [<i>what is termed</i>] الاـِعْرَاب [here meaning what grammarians generally intend thereby, namely, <i>desinential syntax,</i> or <i>the science of the various inflections of words, literal</i> or <i>virtual, by reason of the various governing words</i>]. (S, O.) [اعرب is also used by grammarians as meaning <i>He declined</i> a word; and اُعْرِبَ as meaning <i>It was declined,</i> or <i>declinable;</i> in these senses opposed to بَنَى and بُنِىَ, inf. n. بِنَا=ءٌ: and the former also as meaning <i>He analyzed grammatically,</i> or <i>parsed,</i> a sentence: and the inf. n. of the verb (act. and pass.) in these senses is اـِعْرَابٌ.] ―         -b3-  See also 2, first sentence: ―         -b4-  and again in the first third part of the paragraph. ―         -b5-  اـِعْرَابٌ also signifies The <i>making</i> [a person] <i>to revert from,</i> or <i>relinquish, foul speech;</i> (K, TA;) and so ↓ <br>\

      تَعْرِيبٌ, and ↓ <br>\
      اِسْتِعْرَابٌ: (O, K:) thus it bears two contr. significations. (K, TA.) One says of a man, اعرب [&amp;amp;c.], (S, O,) or اعرب فِى كَلَامِهِ, (Msb,) <i>He spoke foul,</i> or <i>obscene, language.</i> (S, O, Msb.) [Golius and Freytag have assigned this meaning to ↓ <br>\
      تعرّب also: the latter of them as from the S and K; in neither of which do I find it.] ―         -b7-  And The <i>act of copulating:</i> or the <i>speaking of that act in an oblique,</i> or <i>indirect, manner.</i> (K.)       -A2-  And اعرب, (S, O,) inf. n. اـِعْرَابٌ, (K,) <i>He had a child born to him of Arabian complexion,</i> or <i>colour.</i> (S, O, K.) ―         -b2-  And <i>He possessed,</i> or <i>acquired,</i> or <i>sought to acquire, horses,</i> or <i>camels, of pure Arabian race.</i> (TA.

And A horse&#39;s <i>being known by his neighing to be of pure Arabian race, free from any admixture of other than Arabian blood:</i> (K, TA:) [or his <i>making himself to be known as such by his neighing;</i> for] اعرب means <i>he</i> (a horse) <i>neighed, and was consequently known to be of Arabian race.</i> (A.) ―         -b4-  And The <i>making</i> a horse <i>to run.</i> (K.) Accord. to Fr, one says, اعرب عَلَى فَرَسِهِ, meaning <i>He made his horse to run:</i> but he adds that some say اغرب.

      العَرَبُ المُتَعَرِّبَةُ, (S, O, K,) is an appellation of <i>The insititious</i> [or <i>naturalized Arabs</i>]; (K;) <i>those who are not pure,</i> or <i>genuine, Arabs:</i> (S, O:) or <i>those who spoke the language of Ismá&#39;eel</i> [or <i>Ishmael</i>] <i>the son of Ibráheem</i> [or <i>Abraham</i>], i. e., <i>the dialects of El-Hijáz and the parts adjacent thereto:</i> (Msb:) and the appellation of ↓ <br>\
      مُسْتَعْرِبَةٌ is thought by Az to apply [also] to <i>people not of pure Arabian descent, who have introduced themselves among the Arabs, and speak their language, and imitate their manner</i> or <i>appearance.</i> (TA.) [The former division is most reasonably considered as consisting of the extinct tribes (&#39;Ád, Thamood, and others mentioned in what follows); or of these together with the unmixed descendants of Kahtán, whose claims to the appellation of genuine Arabs are held by many to be equally valid: and the latter division, as consisting of those whose origin is referred, through Ma&#39;add and &#39;Adnán, to Ismá&#39;eel (or Ishmael), whose wife was descended from Kahtán. What I find in the TA, on this subject, is as follows.] The former of these two divisions consisted of nine tribes, descendants of Irem [or Aram] the son of Sám [or Shem] the son of Nooh [or Noah]; namely, &#39;Ád, Thamood, Umeiyim, &#39;Abeel, Tasm, Jedees, &#39;Imleek [or Amalek], Jurhum, and Webári; and from them Ismá&#39;eel [or Ishmael is said to have] learned the Arabic language: and the ↓ <br>\
      مُتَعَرِّبَة are [said to be] the descendants of Ismá&#39;eel, the descendants of Ma&#39;add the son of &#39;Adnán the son of Udd: so says Abu-l-Khattáb Ibn-Dihyeh, surnamed Dhun-Nesebeyn: or the former division consisted of seven tribes, namely, &#39;Ád, Thamood, &#39;Imleek, Tasm, Jedees, Umeiyim, and Jásim; the main portion of whom has become extinct, some remains of them, only, being scattered among the [existing] tribes: so says IDrd: and the appellation of ↓ <br>\
      العَرَبُ العَارِبَةُ is also given to the descendants of Yaarub the son of Kahtán [only]. (TA.) [It should be observed, however, that the appellation of ↓ <br>\
      المُتَعَرِّبَةُ is, by those who hold the extinct tribes above mentioned as the only genuine Arabs, applied to the unmixed descendants of Kahtán; and ↓ <br>\
      المُسْتَعْرِبَةُ, to those who are held to be the descendants of Ismá&#39;eel: thus in the Mz, 1st نوع. Also, it should be observed that the appellation of ↓ <br>\
      العَرَبُ العَارِبِةُ, in the conventional language of Arabic lexicology, is often applied to the Arabs of the classical ages, and the later Arabs of the desert who retained the pure language of their ancestors, indiscriminately: it is thus applied by writers quoted in the Mz (1st نوع) to all the descendants of Kahtán, and those of Ma&#39;add the son of &#39;Adnán (through whom all the descendants of Ismá&#39;eel trace their ancestry) who lived before the corruption, among them, of the Arabic language.] ―         -b3-  ↓ <br>\
      الاَعْرَابُ is the appellation given to <i>Those</i> [<i>Arabs</i>] <i>who dwell in the desert;</i> (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) <i>such as go about in search of herbage and water;</i> and Az adds, <i>whether of the Arabs or of their freedmen:</i> he says that it is applied to <i>those who alight and abide in the desert, and are neighbours of the dwellers in the desert, and journey,</i> or <i>migrate, with them, to seek after herbage and water:</i> (Msb:) it is not a pl. of العَرَبُ, not being like الاَنْبَاطُ, which is pl. of النَّبَطُ; (S, O;) but is a [coll.] gen. n.: (S:) الاَعَارِيبُ occurs as its pl. (S, O, K) in chaste poetry: (S:) it has no sing. [properly so termed]: (K:) the rel. n. is ↓ <br>\
      اَعْرَابِىٌّ, (S, O,) which is applied to single person; (Msb;) as also بَدَوِىٌّ: (TA:) Az says, if one say to an اَعْرَابِىّ, يَا عَرَبِىُّ, he is pleased; and if one say to an عَرَبِىّ, يَا اَعْرَابِىُّ, he is angry. (TA.) ―         -b4-  Authors differ as to the cause why the عَرَب were thus called: some say, because of the perspicuity of their speech, from اـِعْرَابٌ: others, that they were so called from Yaarub the son of Kahtán, who is said to have been the first that spoke the Arabic language; his original language having been, as asserted by IDrd, [what the Arabs term] Syriac; though some say that Ismá&#39;eel was the first that spoke the Arabic language; and some, that Yaarub was the first that spoke Arabic, and that Ismá&#39;eel was the first that spoke the pure Arabic of El-Hijáz, in which the Kur-án was revealed: others say that the عَرَب were so called from العَرَبَةُ, the name of a tract near El-Medeeneh, or a name of Mekkeh and the adjacent region, where Ismá&#39;eel settled, or the same as Tihámeh [as is said in the Mgh, in which this is pronounced to be the most correct derivation], or the general name of the peninsula of Arabia, which is also called العَرَبَاتُ [as is said in the Msb]: but some say that they were so called in like manner as were the فُرْس and the رُوم and the تُرْك and others, not after the name of a land or other than a land, but by the coining of the name, not a term expressive of a quality or a state or condition &amp;amp;c. (TA.) [If the country were called العَرَبَةُ, an inhabitant thereof might be called, agreeably with analogy, عَرَبِىٌّ; and then, the people collectively, العَرَبُ: but I think that the most probable derivation is from the old Hebrew word        <br>\
      <orth lang=&quot;he&quot;>עְרֶב</orth>, meaning “ a mixed people, ” which the Arabs assert themselves to have been, almost from the first; and in favour of this derivation it may be reasonably urged that the old Himyeritic language agrees more in its vocabulary with the Hebrew and Phœnician than it does with the classical and modern Arabic.]       -A2-  See also عَرَبَةٌ.       -A3-  And see عَرِبٌ.       -A4-  [It also app. signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>Vagueness</i> (considered as an unsoundness) in a word; from the same as inf. n. of عَرِبَ used in relation to the stomach &amp;amp;c.:] see 4, latter half.    </entryFree> <br>\
