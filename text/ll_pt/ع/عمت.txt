      عمّت, (O, K,) inf. n. تَعْمِيتٌ; (O;) <i>He wound</i> wool (S, O, * K) <i>in an oblong form,</i> (TA,) or <i>in a round form,</i> (S, O, K,) <i>like a ring,</i> (TA,) <i>for the purpose of its being put in the hand and spun</i> (S, O, K) <i>with the spindle:</i> (TA:) or <i>he wound</i> soft hair of the camel, and wool, <i>into the form of a ring, and spun it, putting it in his hand:</i> (T, TA:) the operation termed عَمْتٌ is performed after beating, and separating and loosening, the wool, and collecting it together, in order to wind it upon the hand, and spin it with the spindle. (AHeyth, TA.) An ex. of the former verb occurs in a verse cited voce رَاجِلَةٌ. (TA.) ―         -b2-  And the former verb signifies also <i>He twisted</i> a rope of [the species of trefoil, or clover, called] قَتّ. (TA.) ―         -b3-  And it is said in the K that عَمَتَ فُلَانًا means <i>He overcame,</i> or <i>subdued, such a one, and made him to refrain,</i> or <i>restrained him;</i> expl. by قَهَرَهُ وَكَفَّهُ: but [SM says that] the correct reading is probably وَلَفَّهُ; for in the L [and in the O, app. on the authority of Az, to whom the same is ascribed in the TA in art. لف] we find what here follows: فُلَانٌ يَعْمِتُ اَقْرَانَهُ means يَقْهَرُهُمْ وَيَلُفُّهُمْ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  <i>Such a one overcomes,</i> or <i>subdues, and throws into confusion, his antagonists:</i> and hence, app., what is said in the K; the author of which probably found يَكُفَّهُمْ erroneously written for يَلُفُّهُمْ in some lexicon, and therefore thought it allowable to make عَمَتَ in this case to have a sing. for its objective complement]: and it is added that this is said in relation to war, and excellence of judgment, and knowledge of the case of the enemy, and the subduing him with the infliction of many wounds. (TA.) ―         -b4-  عَمَتَهُ also signifies <i>He beat him with a staff,</i> or <i>stick, not caring</i> [for any one]. (K.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>A portion</i> of wool, (S, * O, * K,) or of the soft hair of the camel, (S, O,) <i>wound in the manner described in the first sentence of this art.;</i> (S, O, K;) like a سَبِيخَة of cotton, and a سَلِيلَة of [goats&#39;] hair, (S, O, TA,) or a فَلِيلَة of [goats&#39;] hair: (ISd, TA:) the pl. [of pauc.] is اَعْمِتَةٌ and [of mult.] عُمُتٌ [and coll. gen. n., improperly called a pl.,] ↓ <br>\
      عَمِيتٌ; (K;) or, accord. to ISd, اَعْمِتَةٌ is pl. of عَمِيتٌ, which is pl. of عَمِيتَةٌ; (TA;) and عَمَايِتُ is a pl. of this last. (AHeyth, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

(TA.) ―         -b2-  And (some say, S, O) <i>Ignorant and weak.</i> (S, O, K.) ―         -b3-  And (some say, O) <i>Drunken:</i> (O, K:) and <i>who cannot go aright,</i> or <i>knows not the course,</i> or <i>way, that he would pursue:</i> (K:) which last explanation and that which immediately precedes it (i. e. “ drunken ”) appear, from the L and other lexicons, to be one signification. (TA.) The pl. is عَمَامِيتُ. (S, O.)    </entryFree> <br>\
