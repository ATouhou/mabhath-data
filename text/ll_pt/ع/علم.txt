                  , inf. n. عِلْمٌ, <i>He knew it;</i> or <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, acquainted with it;</i> syn. عَرَفَهُ: (S, K:) or <i>he knew it</i> (عَرَفَهُ) <i>truly,</i> or <i>certainly:</i> (B, TA:) by what is said above, and by what is afterwards said in the K, العِلْمُ and المَعْرِفَةُ and الشُّعُورُ are made to have one meaning; and this is nearly what is said by most of the lexicologists: but most of the critics discriminate every one of these from the others; and العِلْمُ, accord. to them, denotes the highest quality, because it is that which they allow to be an attribute of God; whereas they did not say [that He is] عَارِفٌ, in the most correct language, nor شَاعِرٌ: (TA:) [respecting other differences between العِلْم and المَعْرِفَة, the former of which is more general in signification than the latter, see the first paragraph of art. عرف: much might be added to what is there stated on that subject, and in explanation of العِلْم, from the TA, but not without controversy:] or عَلِمَ signifies تَيَقَّنَ [i. e. <i>he knew</i> a thing, <i>intuitively,</i> and <i>inferentially,</i> as expl. in the Msb in art. يقن]; العِلْمُ being syn. with اليَقِينُ; but it occurs with the meaning of الَمَعْرِفَةُ, like as المَعْرِفَةُ occurs with the meaning of العلْمُ, each being made to import the meaning of the other because each is preceded by ignorance [when not attributed to God]: Zuheyr says, [in his Mo&#39;allakah,] <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\

                     <L><br>\
                        وَلٰكِنِّنِى عَنْ عِلْمِ مَا فِى غَدٍ عَمِ<br>\
                  </quote> meaning وَاَعْرِفُ [i. e. <i>And I know the knowledge of the present day, and of yesterday before it; but to the knowledge of what will be to-morrow I am blind</i>]: and it is said in the Kur [viii. 62], لَا تَعْلَمُونَهُمْ اَللّٰهُ يَعْلَمُهُمْ, meaning لَا تَعْرِفُونَهُمْ اَللّٰهُ <br>\
                  يَعْرِفُهُمْ [i. e. <i>Ye know them not,</i> but <i>God knoweth them</i>]; المَعْرِفَة being attributed to God because it is one of the two kinds of عِلْم, [the intuitive and the inferential,] and the discrimination between them is conventional, on account of their different dependencies, though He is declared to be free from the imputation of antecedent ignorance and from acquisition [of knowledge], for He knows what has been and what will be and how that which will not be would be if it were, his عِلْم being an eternal and essential attribute: when عَلِمَ denotes اليَقِين, it [sometimes] has two objective complements; but as syn. with عَرَفَ, it has a single objective complement: (Msb:) it has two objective complements in the saying, in the Kur [lx. 10], فَاـِنْ عَلِمْتُمُوهُنَّ مُوْمِنَاتٍ [<i>And</i> <br>\
                  <i>if ye know them to be believers</i>]; and [in like manner] they allowed one&#39;s saying عَلِمْتُنِى [meaning <i>I knew myself to be</i>], like as they said رَاَيْتُنِى and حَسِبْتُنِى &amp;amp;c.: (TA:) and sometimes it imports the meaning of شَعَرَ, and is therefore followed by بِ: (Msb:) [thus] عَلِمَ بِهِ signifies شَعَرَ or شَعُرَ (accord. to different copies of the K) [i. e. <i>He knew it;</i> as meaning <i>he knew,</i> or <i>had knowledge, of it; was cognizant of it;</i> or <i>understood it:</i> or <i>he knew the minute particulars of it:</i> or <i>he perceived it by means of any of the senses:</i> and sometimes this means <i>he became informed,</i> or <i>apprised, of it:</i> and sometimes, <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, knowing in it</i>]: or in this case, [as meaning شَعَرْتُ بِهِ,] you say, عَلِمْتُهُ and عَلِمْتُ بِهِ [<i>I knew it;</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (Msb:) and one says, مَا عَلِمْتُ <br>\
                  بِخَبَرِ قُدُومِهِ, meaning مَا شَعَرْتُ [<i>I knew not,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>the tidings of his coming,</i> or <i>arrival</i>]. (TA.) ↓ <br>\
      اعتلمهُ, also, signifies عَلِمَهُ [<i>He knew it;</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (K.) And one says ↓ <br>\
      تَعَلَّمْ in the place of اِعْلَمْ [<i>Know thou;</i> &amp;amp;c.]: ISk says, تَعَلَّمْتُ اَنَّ فُلَانًا <br>\
                  خَارِجٌ is a phrase used in the place of عَلِمْتُ [as meaning <i>I knew,</i> or, emphatically, <i>I know, that such a one was,</i> or <i>is, going forth</i>]; adding, [however,] when it is said to thee, اِعْلَمْ اَنَّ زَيْدًا خَارِجٌ [<i>Know thou that Zeyd is going forth</i>], thou sayest قَدْ عَلِمْتُ [lit. <i>I have known,</i> meaning <i>I do know</i>]; but when it is said, تَعَلَّمْ اَنَّ زَيْدًا خَارِجٌ, thou dost not say, قَدْ تَعَلَّمْتُ; (S:) accord. to IB, these two verbs are not used as syn. except in the imperative forms: (TA:) [or] عَلِمَ الاَمْرَ and ↓ <br>\
      تَعَلَّمَهُ are syn. as signifying اَتْقَنَهُ [app. meaning <i>he knew,</i> or <i>learned, the case,</i> or <i>affair, soundly, thoroughly,</i> or <i>well:</i> see art. تقن: but I think it not improbable, though I do not find it in any copy of the K, that the right reading may be اَيْقَنَهُ, which is syn. with تَيَقَّنَهُ; an explanation of عَلِمَ in the Msb, as mentioned above, being تَيَقَّنَ]. (K, TA.) And الجَمِيعُ ↓ <br>\
      تعالمهُ means عَلِمُوهُ [i. e. <i>All knew him;</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (S, K.) ―         -b2-  عَلِمْتُ عِلْمَهُ [lit. <i>I knew his knowledge,</i> or <i>what he knew,</i> app. meaning <i>I tried, proved,</i> or <i>tested, him, and so knew what he knew;</i> and hence <i>I knew his case</i> or <i>state</i> or <i>condition,</i> or <i>his qualities;</i>] is a phrase mentioned by Fr in explanation of رَبَاْتُ فِيهِ. (TA voce رَبَاَ, q. v. See also the explanation of لَاَ خْبُرَنَّ خَبَرَكَ, in the first paragraph of art. خبر: and see غَبَنُوا خَبَرَهَا, in art. غبن.) ―         -b3-  عَلِمْتُ is also used in the manner of a verb signifying swearing, or asseveration, so as to have a similar complement; as in the saying, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْتُ لَتَاْتِيَنَّ عَشِيَّةً<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>And I certainly knew that thou wouldst,</i> or <i>that she would, assuredly come in the evening</i>]. (TA in art. شهد.) And يَعْلَمُ اْللّٰهُ [<i>God knoweth</i>] is a form of asseveration. (IAth, TA voce قَيْرَوَانٌ: see an ex. in art. قير.)       -A2-  عَلُمَ, agreeably with what is said in the M, which is عَلُمَ هُوَ نَفْسُهُ, accord. to the K عَلِمَ هُوَ فِى نَفْسِهِ, but the verb in this case is correctly like كَرُمَ, (TA,) <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, such as is termed</i> <br>\
                  عَالِم <br>\
                  <i>and</i> <br>\
                  عَلِيم; (M, * K, * TA;) meaning <i>he possessed knowledge</i> (العِلْم) <i>as a faculty firmly rooted in his mind:</i> (IJ, * TA:) accord. to IB, <i>i. q.</i> ↓ <br>\
      تعلّم [q. v., as intrans.]: and <i>he was,</i> or <i>became, equal to the</i> <br>\
                  عُلَمَا=ء [pl. of عَالِمٌ and of عَلِيمٌ]. (TA.)       -A3-  عَالَمَهُ فَعَلَمَهُ, aor.      <br>\

                     عَلِمَ<br>\
                  , (K,) inf. n. عَلْمٌ, (TA.) signifies <i>He marked it;</i> syn. وَسَمَهُ. (K.) And one says, عَلَمْتُ عِمَّتِى, meaning <i>I wound my turban upon my head with a mark whereby its mode should be known.</i> (TA.) [See also 4.]       -A5-  عَلَمَ شَفَتَهُ, aor.      <br>\

                     عَلَمَ<br>\
                  , (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. عَلَمٌ, (S, Msb,) <i>He</i> (a man, S) <i>had a fissure in his upper lip:</i> (S, Msb, K:) or <i>in one of its two sides.</i> (K.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>علّمهُ</b>               1     <br>\

                  <i>and</i> <br>\
                  عَلِيم; i. e., <i>made him to possess knowledge</i> (العِلْم) <i>as a faculty firmly rooted in his mind:</i> and hence, <i>he taught him.</i> And it generally has a second objective complement]. You say, عَلَّمْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ [<i>I made him to know,</i> or <i>taught him, the thing</i>], in which case the teshdeed is [said to be] not for the purpose of denoting muchness [of the action; but see what follows]; (S;) and عَلَّمْتُهُ الفَاتِحَةَ [<i>I taught him the Opening Chapter of the Kur-án</i>], and الصَّنْعَةَ [<i>the art,</i> or <i>craft</i>], &amp;amp;c.; inf. n. تَعْلِيمٌ; (Msb;) and علّمهُ <br>\
                  العِلْمَ, inf. n. تَعْلِيمٌ and عِلَّامٌ, the latter like كِذَّابٌ; and اـِيَّاهُ ↓ <br>\
      اعلمهُ; (K;) both, accord. to the K, signifying the same [i. e. <i>he taught him knowledge,</i> or <i>science</i>]; but Sb makes a distinction between them, saying that عَلَّمْتُ is like اَذَّنْتُ, and that ↓ <br>\
      اَعْلَمْتُ is like ا=ذَنْتُ; and Er-Rághib says that ↓ <br>\
      الاـِعْلَامُ is particularly applied to quick information; and التَّعْلِيمُ is particularly applied to that which is repeated and much, so that an impression is produced thereby upon the mind of the مُتَعَلِّم: and some say that the latter is <i>the exciting the attention of the mind to the conception of meanings;</i> and sometimes it is used in the sense of الاـِعْلَام when there is in it muchness: (TA:) you say, الخَبَرَ ↓ <br>\
      اَعْلَمْتُهُ and بِالخْبَرِ [meaning <i>I made known,</i> or <i>notified,</i> or <i>announced, to him,</i> or <i>I told him,</i> or <i>I made him to know,</i> or <i>have knowledge of, the news,</i> or <i>piece of information; I acquainted him with it; told, informed, apprised, advertised,</i> or <i>certified, him of it; gave him information, intelligence, notice,</i> or <i>advice, of it</i>]: (Msb:) see also 10: [hence the inf. n. ↓ <br>\
      اـِعْلَامٌ is often used, as a simple subst., to signify <i>a notification, a notice, an announcement,</i> or <i>an advertisement:</i>] and sometimes ↓ <br>\
      اعلم has three objective complements, like اَرَى; as in the saying, اَعْلَمْتُ زَيْدًا عَمْرًا مُنْطَلِقًا [<i>I made known,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>to Zeyd that &#39;Amr was going away</i>]. (I&#39;Ak p. 117.) ―         -b2-  See also 4, in three places.    </entryFree> <br>\

                  عِلْم,] <i>and I surpassed him in</i> <br>\
                  عِلْم [i. e. <i>knowledge,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: (S, K:) [the measure يَفْعَلُ,] and in like manner the measure يَفْعِلُ, in every case of this kind, is changed into يَفْعُلُ: so says Az: [but see 3 in art. خصم:] and Lh mentions the phrase, مَا كُنْتُ اَرَانِى اَنْ اَعْلُمَهُ [<i>I did not think,</i> or <i>know, that I should surpass him in knowledge</i>].
