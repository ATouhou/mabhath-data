(L.) And عَمِدَتْ اَلْيَتَاهُ مِنَ <br>\

                  <i>His buttocks became swollen, and quivered,</i> or <i>throbbed, in consequence of</i> [<i>long and hard</i>] <i>riding.</i> (En-Nadr, O, K.) And عَمِدَ, aor. and inf. n. as above, said of a pustule, <i>It became swollen in consequence of its having been squeezed before it had become ripe, and its egg</i> [or <i>white globule</i>] <i>did not come forth.</i> (L, TA.) ―         -b3-  Also <i>He suffered pain.</i> (L.) ―         -b4-  And, (T, O, L, K,) inf. n. as above, (T, L,) <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, angry:</i> (T, O, L, K:) like عَبِدَ (T, L) [and اَمِدَ and اَبِدَ].

                  قَوْمُهُ (S, O, L) i. e. <i>Do I wonder at a chief whom his</i> [<i>own</i>] <i>people have slain?</i> (L) was said by Aboo-Jahl (S, O, L) when he lay prostrated at Bedr; meaning, hath anything more happened than the slaughter of a chief by his [own] people? this is not a disgrace [to him]: he meant thereby that the destruction that befell him was a light matter to him: (A&#39;Obeyd, L:) the saying is interrogative; (Sh, L;) اَعْمَدُ being app. contracted from اَاَعْمَدُ, by the suppression of one of the two hemzehs. (Az, L.) And اَعْمَدُ مِنْ كَيْلٍ مُحِّقَ, as related by A&#39;Obeyd, [and thus in the O, in two copies of the S written مُحِقّ, and in a third copy omitted,] or مُحِقَ, without teshdeed, as seen by Az written in an old book, [i. e. <i>Do I wonder at a measure incompletely filled?</i>] is a saying of the Arabs, expl. in the book above alluded to, and, Az thinks, correctly, as meaning is it anything more than a measure incompletely filled? [and in a similar manner, but not so fully, expl. in two copies of the S and in the O:] or, accord. to IB, is it anything more than the fact of my measure&#39;s being incompletely filled?

(From a marginal note in one of my copies of the S.) ―         -b6-  عَمِدَ بِهِ means <i>He kept,</i> or <i>clave, to it;</i> (Ibn-Buzurj, O, K;) namely, a thing. (O.)    </entryFree> <br>\
