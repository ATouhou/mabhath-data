                  <i>He hocked, houghed, hamstrung,</i> or <i>cut the hock-tendon of, the beast.</i> (S, A, O, K, *) ―         -b2-  And عَرْقَبَهُ <br>\
                  <i>He raised his hocks,</i> (namely, a camel&#39;s, O,) <i>in order that he might stand up:</i> (O, K:) <i>he assisted him</i> (i. e. a camel) <i>to stand up, by raising</i> [<i>his hocks</i>]. (TA.) Thus the verb has two contr. meanings. (K.) ―         -b3-  And عَرْقَبَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He practised artifice, craft,</i> or <i>cunning.</i> (O, K.) One says, اـِذَا اَعْيَاكَ غَرِيمُكَ فَعَرْقِبْ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>When thy debtor wearies thee,</i>] <i>practise artifice,</i> &amp;amp;c. (AA, O, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>He mounted</i> a beast <i>from behind.</i> (O, TA.) ―         -b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  <i>He took his course along the narrow roads,</i> or <i>ways, of the mountain, which are called</i> <br>\
                  عَرَاقِيب. (S, O, K.) ―         -b3-  And تعرقب <br>\
                  لِخَصْمِهِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He pursued a way hidden from his adversary:</i> said when one adopts another and easier course of speech. (TA.) ―         -b4-  And تعرقب <br>\
                  عَنِ الاَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He turned away,</i> or <i>declined, from the affair.</i> (K.) ―         -b5-  اـِذَا مَطَلَ تَعَقْرَبَ وَاـِذَا وَعَدَ <br>\
                  تَعَرْقَبَ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>When he puts off the fulfilment of his promise, he acts like &#39;Akrab</i> (a man notorious for putting off the fulfilment of his promises); <i>and when he promises, he acts like &#39;Orkoob</i>] (A, TA) is a prov.

<b>عُرْقُوبٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     عُرْقُوبٌ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                   [The <i>tendo Achillis,</i> or <i>heel-tendon;</i>] <i>a certain tense,</i> (T, A, Mgh, Msb,) or <i>thick,</i> (K,) or <i>thick and tense,</i> (S, O,) <i>tendon,</i> (T, S, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) <i>behind the two ankle-bones,</i> (T, A, Mgh, Msb,) <i>above the heel;</i> (S, O, K;) the <i>thing that conjoins the shank and the foot;</i> (As, TA;) in a human being: (S, O, K:) pl. عَرَاقِيبُ. (TA, &amp;amp;c.) The saying of the Prophet, وَيْلٌ لِلْعَرَاقِيبِ <br>\
                  مِنَ النَّارِ [<i>Woe to the heel-tendons from the fire</i> of Hell] means, to him who neglects the washing of them (Mgh, Msb) in the [ablution termed] وُضُوْء. (Msb.) ―         -b2-  [In a beast, it is in some instances applied to The <i>hock,</i> or <i>hough;</i> i. e.] the عُرْقُوب of a beast is <i>that which, in its hind leg, corresponds to the</i> <br>\
                  رَكْبَة [or <i>knee</i>] <i>in its fore leg:</i> (S, O, K:) [in other instances, it is applied to the <i>tendon of the hock,</i> or <i>hough;</i> i. e., to the <i>hamstring;</i> for, as] As says, in every quadruped, the عُرْقُوبَانِ are in the hind legs, and the رُكْبَتَانِ in the fore legs; (S, O, TA;) and the عُرْقُوب of the horse is the <i>tendon that conjoins the part wherein meet the</i> <br>\
                  وَظِيف [here meaning the <i>metatarsus</i>] <i>and the</i> <br>\
                  سَاق [here meaning the <i>tibia</i>]: (TA: [he says “ of the horse, ” instead of using a more comprehensive term, app. because he is describing that animal:]) it is, in a quadruped, the <i>tendon that</i> [<i>corresponds to that which in a human being</i>] <i>is behind the two ankle-bones, between the joint of the foot and the shank:</i> in a human being it is a little above the heel. (TA, from an explanation of a trad. [This last explanation evidently employs terms according to their applications in the comparative anatomy of quadrupeds and human beings, and therefore requires the words which I have supplied. That عُرْقُوبٌ, in relation to a beast, signifies the <i>hocktendon</i> is well known: and that it also signifies the <i>hock</i> itself is shown by a usage of the verb عَرْقَبَ (for it is by raising the hocks that a man assists a camel to stand up), and by an explanation voce رُكْبَةٌ.]) شَرٌّ مَا اَجَا=ءَكَ اـِلَى مُخَّةِ عُرْقُوبٍ [<i>It is an evil thing that has compelled thee to have recourse to the marrow of a hock</i>] (K, TA) is a prov. (TA) applied to him who seeks to obtain a thing from a mean, or sordid, person; (K, TA;) for the عرقوب has no marrow. (TA.) And one says, فُلَانٌ يَضْرِبُ العَرَاقِيبَ ويَقْرَعُ الظَّنَابِيبَ [<i>Such a one smites the hock-tendons</i> of camels to slaughter them, <i>and strikes the shins</i> of camels to make them lie down that he may mount them in haste]; meaning that he entertains guests and gives aid, or succour. (A.) ―         -b3-  عُرْقُوبُ الاَسَدِ is a name of <i>The Thirteenth Mansion of the Moon.</i> (Kzw: see العَوَّا=ءُ, in art. عو.) ―         -b4-  طَيْرُ عُرْقُوبٍ is an appellation given to <i>Any bird from which one augurs evil to camels, because it wounds them in the hocks</i> or <i>hock-tendons</i> (يُعَرْقِبُهَا). (Meyd, TA.) The Arabs say that when the bird called اَخْيَل [q. v.] lights upon a camel, its hocks, or hock-tendons, will assuredly be laid bare: and accord. to the [O and] K, طَيْرُ العَرَاقِيبِ is an appellation of <i>The</i> [<i>bird called</i>] شِقِرَّاق [which is said in the S &amp;amp;c. to be the same as the اَخْيَل]; and [Sgh and SM add that] they regard it as of evil omen. (TA.) ―         -b5-  عُرْقُوبُ القَطَا means <i>The</i> <br>\
                  سَاق [or <i>shank</i>] <i>of the</i> <br>\
                  قطا [or <i>sand-grouse</i>]. (S, O, K.) To this a thing is hyperbolically likened to denote its shortness: one says يَوْمٌ اَقْصَرُ مِنْ عُرْقُوبِ القَطَا [<i>A day shorter than the shank of the katà</i>]: (L, TA:) and a poet says, (S, &amp;amp;c.,) namely, El-Find Ez-Zimmánee, (O, L, TA,) or, accord. to Seer, Imra-el- Keys Ibn-&#39;Ábis, (IB, L, TA,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَنَبْلِى وَفُقَاهَا كَعَرَاقِيبِ قَطًا طُحْلِ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>And my arrows, with their notches, like the shanks of ash-coloured sand-grouse</i>]. (S, O, L, TA.) ―         -b6-  عُرْقُوبٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>A turning,</i> or <i>bending, part</i> of a valley: (K:) or <i>a part</i> of a valley <i>in which is a great turning</i> or <i>bending.</i> (S, O.) And <i>A road in a mountain:</i> (K:) or <i>a narrow road in a mountain:</i> or <i>a road in a deep valley, in which only one can walk.</i> (TA.) And [the pl.] عَرَاقِيبُ, (tropical:)  The <i>prominences,</i> or <i>projecting parts,</i> of mountains: (O, K, TA:) and the <i>most distant,</i> or <i>far-extending, roads,</i> or <i>ways,</i> thereof: (Aboo-Kheyreh, O, TA:) for [in travelling mountains,] you follow the most easy way, wherever it be: (Aboo-Kheyreh, TA:) or the <i>narrow roads</i> or <i>ways, in the hard and elevated parts,</i> of moun-  tains. (S, O, K.) And [hence, app.,] عَرَاقِيبُ الاُمُورِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Great and difficult affairs:</i> (S, O, K:) as also عَرَاقِيلُهَا. (S, O.) ―         -b7-  And <i>A mountain always crowned with clouds, not rained upon.</i> (TA.) ―         -b8-  Also (assumed tropical:)  <i>Artifice, craft,</i> or <i>cunning;</i> or <i>a stratagem,</i> or <i>trick.</i> (O, K. [See Q. 1, last signification.]) ―         -b9-  And (assumed tropical:)  <i>Knowledge</i> (عِرْفَان) <i>of an argument, a plea, an allegation,</i> or <i>a proof.</i> (O, K.)       -A2-  Also the name of a certain man of the Amalekites, (S, O, K, TA,) or, (so says Ibn-El-Kelbee, O,) of the Benoo-Abd-Shems-Ibn-Saad, (Jm, O, TA,) but this is said to be of no authority, (O,) or of El-Ows, (Jm, TA,) the greatest liar of his time, (K,) proverbial for breach of promises: (S, O:) El-Ashja&#39;ee (whose name was Jubeyhà, O, K) says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَعَدْتَ وَكَانَ الخُلْفُ مِنْكَ سَجِيَّةً<br>\

                        مَوَاعِيدَ عُرْقُوبٍ اَخَاهُ بِيَتْرَبِ<br>\
                  </quote> (S, O, K, TA) i. e. (tropical:)  <i>Thou promisedst, but breach of promise was an inherent quality of thee, like the promises of &#39;Orkoob to his brother in Yetreb;</i> which is in El-Yemámeh; or, as some relate it, بِيَثْرِب, i. e. El-Medeeneh, or, as some say, the land of the Benoo-Saad; but the former is the more correct. (TA. [See also Har p. 160.]) And one says, هُوَ اَكْذَبُ مِنْ عُرْقُوبِ يَتْرَبَ (tropical:)  [<i>He is more mendacious than &#39;Orkoob of Yetreb</i>]. (A, TA.)   </entryFree> <br>\
