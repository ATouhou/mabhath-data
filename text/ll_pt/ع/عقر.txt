      عقّرهُ, inf. n. تَعْقِيرٌ; or the latter signifies <i>he wounded him much;</i> for it is said that] تَعْقِيرٌ signifies more than عَقْرٌ: (S, O:) you say of a lion, and of a lynx, and of a leopard, and of a wolf, يَعْقِرُ النَّاسَ [<i>He wounds men</i>]. (Az, Msb.) ―         -b2-  And عَقَرَهُ, (S, O, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.,) and عَقَرَهَا, (L, Mgh, &amp;amp;c.,) aor.      <br>\
                     عَقِرَ<br>\

      عقّرهُ, (K,) and عقّرها, (L,) inf. n. تَعْقِيرٌ; (TA;) [or the latter has an intensive signification, or applies to many objects; see above;] <i>He hocked, houghed,</i> or <i>hamstrung,</i> (عَرْقَبَ,) <i>him,</i> or <i>her,</i> namely, a beast; (TA;) <i>he laid bare his</i> [or <i>her</i>] (namely, a camel&#39;s) عُرْقُوب [or <i>hock-tendon</i>]; such being the meaning of عقر with the Arabs; (Az, TA;) <i>he struck,</i> (S, IAth, Mgh, Msb,) or <i>cut,</i> (TA,) <i>his,</i> (a camel&#39;s, S, IAth, O, Msb, or a horse&#39;s, S, O, or a sheep&#39;s or goat&#39;s, IAth,) or <i>her,</i> (a camel&#39;s, L, Mgh,) <i>legs,</i> <br>\
                  بِالسَّيْفِ <br>\
                  <i>with the sword,</i> (S, IAth, Mgh, O, Msb, TA,) <i>while the beast was standing;</i> (IAth;) <i>he cut one of his,</i> or <i>her,</i> (a camel&#39;s,) <i>legs,</i> previously to stabbing the animal, that it might not run away when being stabbed, but might fall down, and so be within his power; <i>he moved</i> [<i>his</i> or] <i>her</i> (a camel&#39;s) <i>legs with the sword;</i> (IKtt, TA;) <i>he made a mark,</i> or <i>wound, like a notch, in his,</i> or <i>her,</i> (a horse&#39;s, or a camel&#39;s,) <i>legs.</i> (K.) [See عَقْرٌ, below.] ―         -b3-  Hence (Az, TA,) عَقَرَهُ, aor. and inf. n. as above, <i>He stabbed him,</i> namely, a camel; <i>slaughtered him by stabbing:</i> (Az, Msb, TA:) because the slaughterer of the camel first lays bare its عَرْقُوب [or hocktendon; or hocks it; or strikes or cuts its legs,  or one of its legs, with a sword: see above]. (Az, TA.) So in the saying of Imra-el-Keys, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>And the day when I slaughtered for the virgins my riding-camel</i>]. (TA.) And so in the trad. لَا <br>\
                  عَقْرَ فِى الاـِسْلَامِ [<i>There shall be no slaughtering of camels</i> at the grave <i>in</i> the time of <i>El-Islám</i>]: for they used to slaughter camels at the graves of the dead, saying, The occupant of the grave used to slaughter camels for guests in the days of his life; so we recompense him by doing the like after his death. (IAth, TA.) ―         -b4-  Hence also, <i>He slew him; he destroyed him:</i> of this signification we have an ex. in the story of Umm-Zara: وَعَقْرَ <br>\
                  جَارَتِهَا <br>\
                  <i>And</i> [a cause of] <i>the destruction of her fellow-wife</i> through [the latter&#39;s] envy [of her] and rage [against her]. (TA.) ―         -b5-  حَلْقَى ↓ <br>\
      عَقْرَى, (Mgh, O, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.,) said of a woman, (TA,) occurring in a trad. of Safeeyeh, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) in which Mohammad is related to have used this expression, on the day of the return of the pilgrims from Minè, when he was told that she had her menstrual flux, to which he added, “ I see her not to be aught but a hinderer of us; ” thus accord. to the relaters of traditions, each word being an inf. n., like دَعْوَى; (O, * TA;) of the measure فَعْلَى; or, as some say, the ى is to mark a pause; (Mgh;) and عَقْرًا حَلْقًا, (O, K,) which are also inf. ns.; (TA;) and this is accord. to the usage of the Arabs; (Az, TA;) being a form of imprecation, though not meant to express a desire for its having effect, (Az, Msb, TA,) for what is meant by it is only blame; (Msb;) expl. by وَعَقَرَهَا اْللّٰهُ تَعَالَى وَحَلَقَهَا, (K,) i. e., [<i>May God</i> (<i>exalted be He</i>) <i>wound her,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>and</i>] <i>shave her hair,</i> or <i>afflict her with a pain in her throat:</i> (TA:) or <i>may her body be wounded</i> (عُقِرَ), <i>and may she be afflicted with a disease in her throat:</i> (Mgh, O: *) so accord. to A&#39;Obeyd: or <i>may her leg and her throat be cut:</i> or <i>may her leg be cut and her head shaven:</i> (Mgh:) [or <i>may she be destroyed, and may her throat be cut:</i>] or the two words عقرى and حلقى are epithets, applied to a woman of ill luck; and the meaning is, (Z, O, TA,) <i>she is one who extirpates</i> [or <i>destroys, and cuts the throats of,</i>] <i>her people, by the effect of her ill luck upon them;</i> (Z, O, K, * TA;) being virtually in the nom. case, as enunciatives; i. e., وَحَلْقَى ↓ <br>\
      هِىَ عَقْرَى. (Z, TA.) Lh mentions the phrase, ↓ <br>\
      لَا تَفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ اُمُّكَ عَقْرَى [app. meaning, <i>Do thou not that: may thy mother be childless:</i> (see عَقُرَت:)] without explaining it: but he mentions it with the phrases اُمُّكَ ثَاكِلٌ and اُمُّكَ <br>\
                  هَابِلٌ. (TA.) Or ↓ <br>\
      عَقْرَى signifies <i>Having the menstrual flux.</i> (K.) One says also, imprecating a curse upon a man, جَدْعًا لَهُ وَعَقْرًا وَحَلْقًا, meaning, <i>May God</i> [<i>maim him, and</i>] <i>wound</i> (عَقَرَ) <i>his body, and afflict him with a pain in his throat:</i> and sometimes, حَلْقَى ↓ <br>\
      عَقْرَى, without tenween. (S.) [See also 1 in art. حلق.] ―         -b6-  عَقَرَبِهِ <br>\
                  <i>He killed the beast which he was riding, and made him to go on foot: he hocked, houghed, or hamstrung, his beast.</i> (TA.) ―         -b7-  Hence, عَقَرْتَ بِى <br>\
                  <i>Thou hast long detained me,</i> or <i>restrained me;</i> as though thou hadst hocked (عَقَرْتَ) my camel and I were therefore unable to journey: ISk cites as an ex. <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                        قَدْ عَقَرَتْ بِاْلْقَوْمِ اُمُّ خَزْرَجِ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>Umm-Khazraj has long detained the party,</i> or <i>people</i>]. (S, O, TA.) And in the A it is said that عَقَرَتْ فُلَانَةُ بِاْلرَّكْبِ means <i>Such a woman,</i> or <i>girl, came forth to the riders on camels, and they staid long in her presence;</i> as though she hocked (عَقَرَت) the camels upon which they rode. (TA.) One says also قَدْ كَانَتْ لِى حَاجَةٌ فَعَقَرَنِى <br>\
                  عَنْهَا <br>\
                  <i>I had a want, and he withheld me from it, and hindered me.</i> (Ibn-Buzurj, L.) Hence, عَقْرُ <br>\
                  النَّوَى, (Az, TA,) meaning صَرْفُهَا حَالًا بَعْدَ حَالٍ [i. e. <i>The shifting about of the course of a journey by successive changes:</i> see صَرْفٌ, third sentence]. (O, TA.) ―         -b8-  And عَقَرَ بِالصَّيْدِ <br>\

                  <i>She</i> (a woman) <i>smote their souls, and wounded their hearts.</i> (O.) ―         -b10-  عَقَرَ النَّخْلَةَ, (inf. n. عَقْرٌ, TA, and subst. [or quasi-inf. n., like جَدَادٌ and صَرَامٌ and قَطَافٌ &amp;amp;c.,] ↓ <br>\

                  <i>He cut down the trees of the pasture-land: he cut down the herbage,</i> or <i>pasture, and spoiled it.</i> (TA.) ―         -b13-  عَقَرَ الكَلَاَ <br>\
                  <i>He ate the herbage,</i> or <i>pasture.</i> (O, K.) And <i>He had the herbage for pasturage.</i> (O.) ―         -b14-  You say of wine, يَعْقِرُ العَقْلَ [<i>It disables the intellect;</i> like as a man disables a beast by hocking him].

It was customary for two men thus to contend for superior munificence, [giving away the flesh of the victims,] but they did so for the sake of display and vain glory; wherefore the eating of the flesh of camels slaughtered on an occasion of this kind is forbidden in a trad., and they are likened to animals sacrificed to that which is not God.
