                     عَنْ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                   is used in three manners:       -A2-  First, it is a prep.: and as such it has ten meanings. (Mughnee, K.) ―         -b2-  (1) It denotes transition; (Msb, Mughnee, K;) either sensibly or virtually; (Msb;) and the Basrees have mentioned no other meaning than this: (Mughnee:) or, as Sb expresses it, (Msb,) it denotes what has passed [or rather it denotes passage] from the thing [that is mentioned immediately after it]: (S, Msb:) Er-Rághib says that it necessarily denotes transition from that to the mention of which it is prefixed: and the grammarians say that it is applied to denote what has passed and become remote from thee. (TA.) Thus in the saying, سَافَرْتُ عَنِ البَلَدِ [<i>I journeyed from the country,</i> or <i>town</i>]. (Mughnee, K. *) And in رَغِبْتُ <br>\
                  عَنْ كَذَا [<i>I abstained from such a thing;</i> and hence, <i>I did not desire,</i> or <i>wish for, such a thing</i>]. (Mughnee.) And رَمَيْتُ عَنِ القَوْسِ [<i>I shot</i> an arrow, or arrows, <i>from the bow</i>]; (S, Mughnee;) because by means of the bow one projects his arrow from the bow, and makes it to pass therefrom: (S:) but another meaning of this will be mentioned in what follows. (Mughnee.) And اَطْعَمْتُهُ عَنْ جُوعٍ [<i>I fed him</i> so as to free him <i>from hunger</i>]; (S, Msb;) making hunger to be quitted, and passed from: (S, * Msb:) and in this case, مِنْ is used in its place, (S, TA,) as in the Kur cvi. 3; (TA;) or the meaning in this instance is, <i>because of hunger.</i> (Jel.) And جَلَسْتُ <br>\
                  عَنْ يَمِينِهِ, [as though] meaning <i>I sat passing away from the place of his right side, in sitting, to another place</i> [<i>adjacent thereto:</i> but see another explanation near the end of the paragraph]. (Msb.) And اِنْصَرِفْ عَنِّى and تَنَحَّ عَنِّى [<i>Turn thou,</i> or <i>go thou, away,</i> or <i>aside, from me</i>]. (TA.) And اَخَذْتُ العِلْمَ عَنْهُ <br>\
                  <i>I understood,</i> or <i>became acquainted with,</i> [or <i>acquired,</i>] <i>knowledge,</i> or <i>science, from him;</i> as though the understanding passed from him. (Msb.) [And similar to this is the phrase رَوَى عَنْ فُلَانٍ, for which عَنْ <br>\
                  فُلَانٍ alone (the verb being understood) is often used, <i>He related</i> a tradition or traditions &amp;amp;c. as learned, or heard, or received, <i>from such a one,</i> or <i>on the authority of such a one.</i> In many other phrases also, some of which will be mentioned in treating of عَنْ as syn. with مِنْ, the former of these two prepositions is to be, or may be, expl. as denoting transition. For ex., one says, دَفَعَ <br>\
                  عَنْهُ and دَافَعَ <br>\
                  <i>He repelled from him;</i> and hence, <i>he defended him:</i> (see art. دفع:) and رَمَى عَنْهُمْ <br>\
                  <i>He shot in defence of them:</i> (see an ex. in a verse cited voce مَعْبُولٌ:) and عَنْهُ is sometimes used for دِفَاعًا عَنْهُ; as in the phrase قَاتَلْتُ عَنْهُ <br>\
                  <i>I fought in defence of him;</i> i. e., <i>repelling from him.</i> But the instances of this and other usages of عَنْ, exclusive of those mentioned in this paragraph, depending upon verbs or part. ns. expressed or obviously understood, are far too numerous to be here collected: many of these will be found among the explanations of words with which they occur.] ―         -b3-  (2) It denotes a compensation; or something given, or received, or put, or done, instead, or in lieu, of another thing. (Mughnee, K.) Thus in the saying [in the Kur ii. 45], وَ اْتَّقُوا يَوْمًا لَا تَجْزِى نَفْسٌ عَنْ نَفْسٍ شَيْيًا [<i>And fear</i> <br>\
                  <i>ye a day</i> wherein <i>a soul shall not give anything as a satisfaction for a soul,</i> i. e. <i>for another soul:</i> or <i>shall not make satisfaction for a soul at all;</i> accord. to the latter rendering, شييا being put in the accus. case after the manner of an inf. n.]. (Mughnee, K. *) And in the saying in a trad., صُومِى عَنْ اُمِّكِ [<i>Fast thou for,</i> or <i>in lieu of, thy mother</i>]. (Mughnee.) ―         -b4-  (3) It denotes superiority (الاِسْتِعْلَا=ء [as used tropically]); (Mughnee, K;) i. e. as <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  عَلَى. (Mughnee.) Thus in the saying of Dhu-l-Isba&#39; El-&#39;Adwánee, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\

                     <L><br>\
                        عَنِّى وَلَا اَنْتَ دَيَّانِى فَتَخْزُوَنِى<br>\
                  </quote> (S, Mughnee,) i. e. <i>To God be attributed the excellence of the son of thy paternal uncle</i> (the meaning being لِلّٰهِ دَرُّ اْبْنِ عَمِّكَ), <i>thou hast not become possessed of superiority, in grounds of pretension to respect</i> or <i>honour, above me,</i> or <i>over me,</i> (عَلَىَّ,) <i>nor art thou my governor that thou shouldst rule me;</i> for the well-known mode is to say اَفْضَلْتُ عَلَيْهِ. (Mughnee.) [Thus too in the phrases تَعَظَّمَ عَنْهُ and تَعَاظَمَ عَنْهُ (expl. in art. عظم), and in the phrase تَجَالَّ عَنْهُ (expl. in art. جل), and the like.] And thus it has been said to be used in the phrase [in the Kur xxxviii. 31], اـِنِّى اَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ اْلْخَيْرِ عَنْ ذِكْرِ رَبِّى, meaning قَدَّمْتُهُ عَلَيْهِ [i. e. <i>Verily I have preferred the love of good things above,</i> or <i>to, the remembrance,</i> or <i>praise, of my Lord</i>]: but it is also said that it is here used in its proper manner, as dependent upon a denotative of state suppressed; the meaning being, مُنْصَرِفًا عَنْ ذِكْرِ رَبِّى [i. e. <i>turning away from the remembrance,</i> &amp;amp;c.]: and AO is related to have said that اَحْبَبْتُ is from اَحَبَّ, البَعِيرُ, signifying “ the camel lay down and did not become roused; ” and that the meaning is, <i>I have become withheld by the love of good things from the remembrance,</i> &amp;amp;c. (Mughnee.) And it is [said to be] used as denoting superiority or the like in the saying [in the Kur xlvii. last verse], فَاـِنَّمَا يَبْخَلُ عَنْ نفْسِهِ [as though the meaning were <i>He is niggardly only to himself</i> (عَلَى نَفْسِهِ, for عَلَى is considered in this case as importing an ideal superiority); but the phrase may be better rendered, agreeably with the proper, or primary, signification of عَنْ, <i>he withholds, with niggardliness, only from himself;</i> as is indicated by Bd]. (Mughnee, K.) ―         -b5-  (4) It denotes a cause. (Mughnee, K.) Thus in the saying [in the Kur ix. 115], وَمَا كَانَ اْسْتِغْفَارُ اـِبْرٰهِيمَ لِاَبِيهِ اـِلَّا عَنْ مَوْعِدَةٍ [<i>And Abraham&#39;s begging forgiveness for his father was not otherwise than because of a promise</i>]. (Mughnee, K.) And thus in the saying [in the Kur xi. 56], وَمَا نَحْنُ بِتَارِكِى ا=لِهَتِنَا عَنْ قَوْلِكَ [<i>And we are not,</i> or <i>will not be, relinquishers of our gods because of thy saying</i>]: or the meaning may be, <i>we do not,</i> or <i>will not, relinquish our gods, turning away</i> (صَادِرِينَ, as a denotative of state relating to the pronoun [implied] in تاركى,) <i>from thy saying;</i> and this is the opinion of Z. (Mughnee.) [See also an ex. voce دَنْدَنَ, last sentence.] ―         -b6-  (5) It is <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  بَعْدَ. (S, Mughnee, K.) Thus in the saying [in the Kur xxiii. 42], عَمَّا قَلِيلٍ <br>\
                  لَيُصْبِحُنَّ نَادِمِينَ, (Mughnee, K,) meaning بَعْدَ <br>\
                  قَلِيلٍ [i. e. <i>After a little</i> while, <i>they will assuredly become repentant</i>]. (TA.) And in the phrase [in the Kur lxxxiv. 19], لَتَرْكَبُنَّ طَبَقًا عَنْ طَبَقٍ [expl. in art. طبق], meaning حَالَةً بَعْدَ حَالَةٍ. (Mughnee.) And in the saying, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَمَنْهَلٍ وَرَدْتُهُ عَنْ مَنْهَلٍ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>And to many a watering-place have I come after a watering-place</i>]. (Mughnee.) And in the saying of El-Hárith Ibn-&#39;Obád, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                     <L><br>\
                        وَلَا تَكُ عَنْ حَمْلِ الرِّبَاعَةِ وَانِيَا<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>And be not thou remiss in bearing the responsibility of the obligation that thou takest upon thyself</i>]; as is shown by the phrase, [in the Kur xx. 44], وَلَا تَنِيَا فِى ذِكْرِى: (Mughnee, K:) so it is said; but it seems that the meaning of وَنَى <br>\
                  عَنْ كَذَا is, “ he passed from such a thing, not entering upon it; ” and وَنَى فِيهِ, “ he entered upon it but was remiss, or languid: ” by الرِّبَاعَة is meant <i>the payment of a bloodwit</i> or <i>the like.</i> (Mughnee.) ―         -b8-  (7) It is <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  مِنْ. (Mughnee, K.) Thus in the saying [in the Kur xlii. 24], وَهُوَ <br>\
                  اْلَّذِى يَقْبَلُ اْلتَّوْبَةَ عَنْ عِبَادِهِ [<i>And He is he who accepts repentance from his servants</i>]. (AO, Mughnee, K.) Az mentions among the cases in which there is a difference between مِنْ and عَنْ, that the former has adjoined to it a noun signifying what is near; and the latter, [one signifying] what is remote; as in one&#39;s saying سَمِعْتُ مِنْ <br>\
                  فُلَانٍ حَدِيثًا [<i>I heard from such a one a narrative</i>], and حَدَّثَنِى عَنْ فُلَانٍ حَدِيثًا [<i>He related to me a narrative from such a one,</i> a phrase similar to رَوَى عَنْ فُلَانٍ, mentioned among exs. of the first meaning of عن]: accord. to As, one says, حَدَّثَنِى فُلَانٌ مِنْ فُلَانٍ, meaning عَنْهُ [i. e. <i>Such a one related to me from such a one</i>]; and لَهِيتُ مِنْ <br>\
                  فُلَانٍ and عَنْهُ [<i>I became diverted from such a one so as to forget him</i>]: accord. to Ks, one says لَهِيتُ عَنْهُ only: and عَنْكَ جَا=ءَ هٰذَا as meaning مِنْكَ [i. e. <i>From thee came this</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b9-  (8) It is <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  بِ. (Mughnee, K.) Thus [it is said to be used] in the phrase [in the Kur liii. 3], وَمَا يَنْطِقُ عَنِ اْلْهَوَى [<i>Nor does he speak with the desire of self-gratification</i>]: (Mughnee, K:) but it seems that it is here used in its proper [or primary] sense; and that the meaning is, وَمَا يَصْدُرُ <br>\
                  قَوْلُهُ عَنْ هَوًى [<i>nor does his speech proceed from desire of self-gratification;</i> so the phrase may be well rendered, <i>nor does he speak from the desire</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (Mughnee.) One says also, اَجَابُوا عَنْ بَوَا=ءٍ وَاحِدٍ, meaning بِجَوَابٍ وَاحِدٍ [i. e. <i>They replied with one reply</i>]. (T, S, O, K, all in art, بوا.) And جَاوُوا <br>\
                  عَنْ ا=خِرِهِمْ [<i>They came with the last of them;</i> <br>\
                  عَنْ being here syn. with بِ; meaning <i>they came all, without exception</i>]. (A in art. اخر.) [And in like manner, قَتَلُوهُمْ عَنْ ا=خِرِهِمْ <br>\
                  <i>They slew them with the last of them;</i> meaning <i>they slew them all, without exception.</i>] ―         -b10-  (9) It denotes the using a thing as an aid or instrument. (Mughnee, K.) Thus in the saying, رَمَيْتُ عَنِ القَوْسِ [<i>I shot with,</i> or <i>by means of, the bow</i>], accord. to Ibn-Málik; (Mughnee, K;) because one says also, رَمَيْتُ <br>\
                  بِالقَوْسِ; both mentioned by Fr. (Mughnee.) [Another explanation of this phrase has been mentioned before.] ―         -b11-  (10) It is redundant, to compensate for another [عن] suppressed (Mughnee, K.) Thus in the saying, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        اَتَجْزَعُ اـِنْ نَفْسٌ اَتَاهَا حِمَامُهَا<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        فَهَلَّا اْلَّتِى عَنْ بَيْنِ جَنْبَيْكَ تَدْفَعُ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>Art thou impatient if the decreed event of death befall a soul? but why wilt not thou repel from,</i> i. e. <i>defend, that which is between thy two sides?</i>]; (Mughnee, K;) the meaning being, تَدْفَعُ عَنِ <br>\
                  اْلَّتِى بَيْنَ جَنْبَيْكَ; (IJ, Mughnee;) عن being suppressed before the conjunct noun [التى], and added after it. (Mughnee, K.) And sometimes it is redundant without compensation, when conjoined with a pronoun: AZ says that the Arabs make عَنْكَ redundant in the phrase خُذْ ذَا عَنْكَ [meaning <i>Take thou,</i> or <i>receive thou, this</i>]: (TA:) [but خُذْ عَنْكَ is expl. in the S and L, in art. اخذ, as meaning خُذْ مَا اَقُولُ وَدَعْ عَنْكَ الشَّكَّ وَالمِرَا=ءَ: see 1 in art. اخذ:] and اُنْفُذْ عَنْكَ, occurring in a trad., is expl. as meaning دَعْهُ [i. e. <i>Leave thou it</i>]: (TA:) or this means <i>go thou from thy place; pass thou from it.</i> (L in art. نفذ.) [See also the last ex. in this paragraph.]       -A3-  The second manner of using it is, as a particle of the kind called مَصْدَرِىٌّ, [combining with an aor. following it to form an equivalent to an inf. n.,] as is done by the tribe of Temeem, (Mughnee, K, *) in what is termed their عَنْعَنَة: (K: [see R. Q. 1:]) they use it in the place of اَنْ; (S, Mughnee;) saying, اَعْجَبَنِى عَنْ تَفْعَلَ, (Mughnee, K,) for اَنْ تَفْعَلَ [meaning <i>Thy doing</i> such a thing <i>pleased me</i>]. (Mughnee.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        اَعَنْ تَرَسَّمْتَ مِنْ خَرْقَا=ءَ مَنْزِلَةً<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        مَا=ءُ الصَّبَابَةِ مِنْ عَيْنَيْكَ مَسْجُومُ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>Is thy having looked upon the traces of a place of</i> <br>\
                  <i>abiding of</i> thy beloved <i>Kharkà</i> the cause that <i>the water of excessive love is shed from thine eyes?</i>]. (S, Mughnee.) And thus they do in the case of اَنَّ; saying, مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اْللّٰهِ ↓ <br>\
      اَشْهَدُ عَنَّ [<i>I acknowledge,</i> or <i>declare,</i> or <i>testify, that Mohammad is the apostle of God</i>]. (Mughnee.)       -A4-  The third manner of using it is, as a noun, in the sense of جَانِب, (Mughnee, K, *) or نَاحِيَة: (S:) and this is said to be in three cases. (Mughnee.) ―         -b2-  (1) It is when مِنْ is prefixed to it; and this is of frequent occurrence: (Mughnee:) as in the saying, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَلَقَدْ اَرَانِى لِلرِّمَاحَ دَرِيْيَةً<br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        مِنْ عَنْ يَمِينِى مَرَّةً وَاَمَامِى<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>And verily I see me to be</i> like <i>a ring for the spears to be aimed at, from the side of my right hand at one time, and from before me</i> at another time]: (Mughnee, K: *) and in the saying, جِيْتُ <br>\
                  مِنْ عَنْ يَمِينِهِ <br>\
                  <i>I came from the side of his right hand.</i> (S.) In the opinion of Ibn-Málik, مِنْ prefixed to عَنْ is redundant; but accord. to others, it is used [as expl. above,] to denote the beginning of a space between two limits: these say that قَعَدْتُ عَنْ يَمِينِهِ means فِى جَانِبِ يَمِينِهِ [i. e. <i>I sat in the side of his right hand</i>], either closely or otherwise; but if you say مِنْ [before عَنْ], the sitting is particularized as being close to the first part of the lateral space. (Mughnee.) ―         -b3-  (2) It is also when عَلَى is prefixed to it: (Mughnee:) thus in the saying, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        عَلَى عَنْ يَمِينِى مَرَّتِ الطَّيْرُ سُنَّحَا<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>On,</i> or <i>over, the side of my right hand, the birds passed along turning the right side towards me,</i> or <i>turning the left side towards me;</i> the last word being a pl., accord. to analogy, of سَانِحٌ, which is used in two opposite senses]: (Mughnee, K:) but this usage is extraordinary; no other instance of it than that here cited having been preserved. (Mughnee.) ―         -b4-  (3) It is also when what is governed by it in the gen. case and the agent of the verb in connection with it are two pronouns having one application: so says Akh: as in the saying of Imra-el-Keys, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        دَعْ عَنْكَ نَهْبًا صِيحَ فِى حَجَرَاتِهِ<br>\
                  </quote> [or فَدَعْ عَنْكَ: see the entire verse cited and expl. in art. حجر]: but it is shown to be not a noun in such a case by this, that جَانِب may not take its place [unless used in a tropical sense]. (Mughnee. [See what has been said above, that عَنْكَ in a phrase of this kind is held to be redundant.])    </entryFree> <br>\

(S, K.) ―         -b2-  It is also said, by El-Bushtee and in the K, to signify <i>A rope;</i> and in a verse of El-Aashà, in which he mentions flesh-meat as put upon the عُنَن, this last word has been expl. as meaning ropes which are stretched, and upon which is thrown the flesh-meat that is cut into strips, or oblong pieces, and dried in the sun: but Az says that the right meaning is, the enclosures for camels; that he had seen such enclosures in the desert, thus called because facing the direction whence blows the north wind, to protect the camels from the cold of that wind; and that he had seen the people spread the flesh-meat cut into strips, or oblong pieces, and dried in the sun, upon them: he thinks that the word was expl. as meaning ropes by one who had seen the poor of the sacred territory extending ropes in Minè, and putting upon them the flesh of the victims of sacrifice that had been given to them.
