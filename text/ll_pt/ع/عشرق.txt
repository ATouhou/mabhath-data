                  فَنًا; <i>and when a grain thereof falls upon the ground and dries, it becomes red as though it were a bit of red wool: sometimes,</i> he says, <i>the women use its leaves in combing and dressing their hair, which it blackens, and causes to grow:</i> he says also, an Arab of the desert, of Rabee&#39;ah, informed me that <i>the</i> <br>\

                  عِظْلِم, <i>intensely green; and its grain is white, pleasant to the taste, easily broken, unctuous, and hot; good for the piles:</i> Aboo-Ziyád also says that <i>the</i> <br>\

                  <i>inclines to whiteness;</i> and that <i>the places of its growth were said by some to be the rugged tracts:</i> (O:) Az says that it is <i>a herb of which the leaves and produce are like those of the</i> <br>\
