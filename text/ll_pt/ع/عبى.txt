      عَبَايَةٌ, but the former the more chaste, are said to signify, as epithets applied to a man, <i>Coarse,</i> or <i>rude, heavy, dull,</i> or <i>stupid,</i> (K, * TA,) and <i>impotent:</i> but this requires correction; for Lth mentions العَبَا, and ↓ <br>\
      العَبَا=ءُ as used by a poet, and says that they signify <i>the coarse,</i> or <i>rude, impotent,</i> man; but Az says that he had not heard العَبَا=ء in this sense on any authority other than that of Lth, and that he held the right reading in the verse cited as an ex. by Lth to be العَيَا=ء, with ى, meaning, as also العَيَايَا=ء, “ the coarse, or rude, or the heavy, dull, or stupid, and impotent, who has no need of women. ” (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
