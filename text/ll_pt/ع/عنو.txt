      عَنَا=ءٌ, (Msb,) or عَنْوَةٌ is its inf. n., (MA,) [and so, app., is عَنَا=ءٌ, in this sense as well as in another sense, accord. to the K,] <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, lowly, humble,</i> or <i>submissive;</i> (S, MA, Mgh, Msb, K,) and <i>obedient;</i> (MA, TA;) to the truth, &amp;amp;c.

                  <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, lowly, humble,</i> or <i>submissive, to him;</i> or <i>obedient to him.</i> (MA.) And hence the saying in the Kur [xx. 110], وَعَنَتِ اْلْوَجُوهُ <br>\
                  لِلْحَىِّ القَيُّومِ (S, TA) <i>And the countenances shall be lowly</i> &amp;amp;c. [<i>to the Deathless,</i> or <i>Ever-living, the Self-subsisting by Whom all things subsist:</i> or <i>shall be downcast;</i> like the Hebr. phrases ending verses 5 and 6 in Gen. iv.]: or <i>shall be submissive like captives:</i> or the meaning is [<i>shall be depressed by</i>] <i>the depressing of the forehead and the knee</i> [or rather <i>knees</i>] <i>and the hands in the lowering of the head and the prostrating oneself</i> [<i>in prayer</i>]: or [عَنَت is here from عَنَى, belonging to art. عنى, and الوجوه is used by a synecdoche for <i>the persons</i> (as being the most noble of all the parts thereof), and the meaning is] <i>shall suffer fatigue,</i> or <i>weariness,</i> and <i>shall toil.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  And عَنَا, inf. n. عُنُوٌّ (M, Msb, K, TA, accord. to some copies of the K [erroneously] عَنْوٌ) and عُنِىٌّ (TA) and عَنَا=ءٌ; (K;) and عَنِىَ; (M, K;) <i>He became a captive:</i> (K:) and the latter verb signifies also <i>he stuck fast in captivity:</i> (K in art. عنى:) or both of these verbs have this latter signification: (Msb:) [or] you say, عَنَا فِيهِمْ فُلَانٌ اَسِيرًا <br>\
                  <i>Such a one remained among them a captive;</i> and <i>was in a state of confinement:</i> (S:) and عَنَا=ءٌ signifies also <i>confinement,</i> or <i>imprisonment, in hardship and humiliation.</i> (TA.) Hence the trad., الخَالُ وَارِثُ <br>\
                  مَنْ لَا وَارِثَ لَهُ يَفُكُّ عُنِيَّهُ i. e. اَسْرَهُ [<i>The maternal uncle is the heir of him who has no</i> more nearlyallied <i>heir: he shall loose his</i> (the latter&#39;s) <i>captivity</i>]: meaning [he shall acquit him of] what is incumbent on him, and clings to him, because of the actions that require punishment or retaliation, the way [or custom] of which is that the عَاقِلَة [q. v., of whom he is a member,] bear the responsibility for them.

(Msb.) [But see below, where عَنْوَةٌ is expl. as though it were the subst. of the verb in these two senses.]       -A3-  عَنَوْتُ الشَّىْءَ <br>\
                  <i>I put forth,</i> or <i>produced, the thing:</i> and <i>I made the thing apparent,</i> or <i>showed it:</i> (S:) or it has the latter signification; (K;) as also عَنَيْتُ الشَّىْءَ: (IKtt, TA in art. عنى:) and عَنَوْتُ بِالشَّىْءِ has the former signification. (K.) And ↓ <br>\
      عَنْوَةٌ is the subst. of the verb thus used, (K, TA,) i. e. in these two senses, as well as in others mentioned above. (TA.)

      اَعْنَتْهُ. (K.) And لَمْ تَعْنُ بِلَادُنَا بِشَىْءٍ and لَمْ تَعْنِ <br>\
