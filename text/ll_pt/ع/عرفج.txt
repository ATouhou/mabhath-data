                  <i>A certain plant,</i> (S,) or <i>a sort of trees</i> [or <i>shrubs</i>], (K,) <i>growing in plain,</i> or <i>soft, land:</i> n. un. with ة: (S, K:) it is said to be <i>of the trees</i> [or <i>shrubs</i>] <i>of the</i> <br>\
                  صَيْف [meaning either <i>spring</i> or <i>summer</i>], <i>soft,</i> or <i>pliable, dust-coloured, and having a rough produce like the</i> <br>\
                  حَسَك [or <i>prickly heads of thistles and similar plants</i>]: (TA:) Aboo-Ziyád says, (O, TA,) as related by AHn, (O,) that <i>it is of sweet,</i> or <i>pleasant, odour, dustcoloured, inclining to greenness, having a yellow blossom;</i> (O, TA;) and when it becomes aggregated and abundant in a place, that place is called حَوْمَانٌ: (O:) <i>it has no grains nor thorns:</i> (O, TA:) <i>it and the</i> <br>\
                  ثُمَام <br>\
                  <i>and the</i> <br>\
                  ضَعَة <br>\
                  <i>grow in plain,</i> or <i>soft, land, and on the mountain; and none of these has thorns: its firewood is the best of firewood in odour, and the quickest in taking fire and in blazing:</i> (O:) AHn [also] says, certain of the Arabs of the desert informed me that <i>its root is wide, occupying a</i> [<i>considerable</i>] <i>piece of ground; and it sends forth many shoots, proportionate to the root, without leaves,</i> [but see خُوصٌ,] <i>being only slender shoots, at the extremities whereof are</i> [<i>buds,</i> or <i>the like, such as are termed</i>] زَمَع, <i>at the heads of which appears a yellow substance like hair:</i> and he says that, accord. to the ancient Arabs of the desert, <i>it occupies a space like that of a man sitting, becomes white when it dries up, has a yellow produce, is eaten in the fresh and dry state by the camels and sheep</i> or <i>goats, and its flame is intensely red,</i> whence one says, كَاَنَّ لِحْيَتَهُ <br>\
                  ضِرَامُ عَرْفَجَةٍ or عَرْفَجٍ [<i>As though his beard were the blazing,</i> or <i>flaming, of an &#39;arfajeh</i> or <i>of &#39;arfaj</i>]. (TA.) The fire of the عرفج is called نَارُ الزَّحْفَتَيْنِ [The fire of the two walks]; because he who kindles it walks to it, and when it burns up he walks from it: (T, TA:) or because it quickly blazes and quickly subsides; so when it blazes they walk from it, and when it subsides they walk to it. (O. [See also art. زحف.]) When the greenness of plants appears in it, it is termed عَرْفَجَةٌ خَاضِبَةٌ. (Aboo- &#39;Obeyd El-Bekree, TA.) When it has been rained upon, and its stalk has become soft, one says ثَقَّبَ عُودُ العَرْفَجِ: when it has become somewhat black, قَمِلَ: when a little more so, اِرْقَاطَّ: when more so, اَدْبَى: and when its خُوص are perfect, اَخْوَصَ. (AA, TA.) ―         -b2-  كَمَنِّ الغَيْثِ عَلَى العَرْفَجَةِ [<i>Like the benefit conferred by the rain upon the &#39;arfajeh</i>], meaning its falling upon it when dry, and causing it to become green, is a prov., said, accord. to AZ, to him upon whom thou hast conferred a benefit and who says to thee, Dost thou confer a benefit upon me? (TA.) ―         -b3-  لَىُّ العَرْفَجَةِ signifies <i>A certain mode of coïtus.</i> (O, K.)    </entryFree> <br>\
