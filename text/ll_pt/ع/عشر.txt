                  عُقُود; (A, K;) with ة, (Msb,) and with fet-h to the ش, (TA,) for the masc.; (Msb, TA;) and عَشْرٌ, without ة, (Msb, TA,) and with one fet-hah, (TA,) for the fem. (Msb, TA.) You say, عَشَرَةُ رِجَالٍ [<i>Ten men</i>]: and عَشْرُ نِسْوَةٍ [<i>ten women</i>]. (S, O, Msb, TA.) [In De Sacy&#39;s Arabic Grammar, for the former is inadvertently put عَشْرَةٌ; and for the latter, عَشَرٌ; and in Freytag&#39;s lexicon we find عَشَرٌ instead of عَشْرٌ.] عَشَرَاتٌ [is the pl. of عَشَرَةٌ: and also] signifies <i>Decimal numbers.</i> (M in art. ست.) The vulgar make عَشْرٌ masc., as meaning a number of days, saying العَشْرُ الاَوَّلُ, and العَشْرُ <br>\
                  الاَخِيرُ; but this is wrong [unless thereby they mean to speak of nights with their days, as will be shown by what follows]: the month consists of three عَشَرَات; namely, العَشْرُ الاُوَلُ [<i>The first ten</i> nights. with their days], pl. of اُولَى; and العَشْرُ الوُسَطُ [<i>The middle ten</i> nights, with their days], pl. of وُسْطَى; and العَشْرُ الاَخَرُ [<i>The last,</i> lit. <i>the other, ten</i> nights, with their days], pl. of اُخْرَى; or العَشْرُ الاَوَاخِرُ [<i>The last ten</i> nights, with their days], pl. of ا=خرَةٌ. (Msb.) [العَشْرُ الاَوَاخِرُ is also especially applied to <i>The last ten</i> nights of Ramadán, with their days: and عَشْرُ ذِى الحِجَّةِ to <i>The</i> first <i>ten</i> nights <i>of Dhu-l-Hijjeh,</i> with their days: and العَشْرُ, alone, to <i>The</i> first <i>ten</i> nights of El-Moharram, with their days.] The Arabs also said, سِرْنَا عَشْرًا, meaning <i>We journeyed ten</i> nights, with their days; making the fem. [لَيَالٍ] to predominate over the masc. [اَيَّام]; as is the case in the Kur ii. 234. (Msb.) And اَيَّامُ العَشْرِ is used for اَيَّامُ <br>\
                  اللَّيَالِى العَشْرِ [<i>The days of the ten nights</i>]. (Mgh.) [See some other observations applying to the syntax of عَشَرَةٌ and عَشْرٌ, voce خَمْسَةٌ. And respecting a peculiar pronunciation of the people of El-Hijáz, and a case in which عَشَرَة is imperfectly decl., see ثَلَاثَةٌ.] ―         -b2-  [عَشْرٌ is also applied to <i>A portion,</i> or <i>paragraph, of the Kur-án properly consisting of ten verses;</i> but it is often applied to <i>somewhat more,</i> or <i>less, than what is considered by some,</i> or <i>by all, as ten verses,</i> either because there is much disagreement as to the divisions of the verses or for the sake of beginning and ending with a break in the tenour of the text: (see عَاشِرَةٌ:) pl. اَعْشَارٌ. These divisions have no mark to distinguish them in some MSS.: in others, each is marked by a round ornament at the end; or by the word عشر, or the letter ع, over, or over against, the commencement.] ―         -b3-  When you have passed the number ten, you make the masc. fem., and the fem. masc. [to nineteen inclusively]: in the masc., you reject the ة in عَشَرَة; and from thirteen to nineteen [inclusively], you add ة to the former of the two nouns; and [in every case] you pronounce the ش with fet-h; and you make the two nouns one noun, [and, as such,] indecl., with fet-h for the termination: (TA:) you say, اَحَدَ عَشَرَ [<i>Eleven</i>], (S, O, Msb,) [and اِثْنَا عَشَرَ <br>\
                  <i>Twelve,</i>] and ثَلَاثَةَ عَشَرَ [<i>Thirteen</i>], and so on; (Msb, TA;) with fet-h to the ش; and in one dial. with sukoon [اَحَدَ عَشْرَ, &amp;amp;c.]; (Msb;) or the former only: (S, O:) and, as ISk says, some of the Arabs make the ع quiescent, [as many do in the present day,] saying اَحَدَ عْشَرَ, and so on to تِسْعَةَ عْشَرَ [inclusively] except in the instance of اِثْنَا عَشَرَ and اِثْنَىْ عَشَرَ, because of the quiescence of the ا and ى; and Akh says that they make the ع quiescent because the noun is long and its vowels are many: (S, O) in the fem., you add ة to the latter of the two nouns, and reject the ة in the former of them, and make the ش in عشرة quiescent: you say اـِحْدَى عَشْرَةَ (TA,) [and اِثْنَتَا <br>\
                  عَشْرَةَ,] and so on to تِسْعَ عَشْرَةَ [inclusively]: and if you choose, you say اـِحْدَى عَشِرَةَ, [&amp;amp;c.,] with kesr to the ش: the former is of the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, [and is the more common,] and the latter is of the dial. of the people of Nejd: (S, O, TA:) but fet-h to the ش in this case is unknown to the grammarians and lexicologists, as Az says, though an instance has been adduced in an unusual reading of the Kur ii. 57, and another in vii. 160. (TA.) Every noun of number, from eleven to nineteen [inclusively], is mansoob, [or more properly speaking, each of the two nouns of which it is composed is indecl., with fet-h,] in the cases of refa and nasb and khafd, except that of twelve; for اِثْنَا and اِثْنَتَا are decl. [i. e. you say, in a case of nasb or khafd, اِثْنَىْ عَشَرَ and اِثْنَتَىْ عَشْرَةَ].
