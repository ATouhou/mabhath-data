(L.) [Hence,] عَضُدُ الرَّكَايِبِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The tract,</i> or <i>part, surrounding the camels,</i> or <i>other beasts, used for riding.</i> (L.) One says, اِمْلِكْ اَعْضَادَ الاـِبِلِ (tropical:)  [lit. <i>Have thou possession of the tracts adjacent to the camels</i>], meaning <i>direct thou aright the course of the camels, so that they may not wander away to the right and left.</i> (A.) ―         -b4-  Also, and ↓ <br>\
