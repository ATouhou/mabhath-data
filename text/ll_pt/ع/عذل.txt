      عذّلهُ <br>\
                  <i>he did so much;</i> for] تَعْذِيلٌ is like عَذْلٌ, signifying مَلَامَةٌ, (K, TA,) [and تَعْذَالٌ is a dial. var. thereof, occurring in the Mo&#39;allakah of Imra-el-Keys, (see EM p. 33,)] but its verb has teshdeed to denote muchness. (TA.) سَبَقَ السَّيْفُ <br>\
                  العَذْلَ [<i>The sword preceded the censure</i>] is a prov. [expl. voce شَجْنٌ]. (TA.) Accord. to IAar, [عَذَلَهُ may signify as above; or <i>he afflicted, annoyed,</i> or <i>hurt, him;</i> for he says,] العَذْلُ signifies الاـِحْرَاقُ; [perhaps meaning الاـِحْرَاقُ <br>\
                  بِاللِّسَانِ; for SM adds,] as though the censurer burned (يُحْرِقُ) by his عَذْل the object thereof: (TA:) [or it may mean also <i>he burned him;</i> for Sgh says,] and العَذْلُ signifies also الاـِحْرَاقُ. (O.)    </entryFree> <br>\

      تعذّل as meaning قَبِلَ مِنْهُ المَلَامَةَ وَاَعْتَبَ [i. e. <i>he admitted,</i> or <i>accepted, blame,</i> or <i>censure, from the man, and reverted;</i> but I think that the right reading is الرَّجُلُ, and that منه should be erased]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  Also <i>He shot,</i> or <i>cast, a second time;</i> (ISk, O, K;) having shot, or cast, and missed: (ISk, O:) or, accord. to the A, <i>he blamed himself for having missed, and therefore shot,</i> or <i>cast, a second time, and hit.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  And <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  اِعْتَزَمَ [perhaps said of a man, and meaning <i>He kept to the course,</i> or <i>right course, in running,</i> or <i>walking, &amp;amp;c.:</i> but more probably, I think, said of a horse, meaning <i>he went along overcoming his rider, in his running, not complying with his desire when he pulled him in</i>]: (K:) accord. to AA, said of a horse as meaning <i>he went quickly, after slowness, and strove,</i> or <i>exerted himself.</i> (O.) ―         -b4-  And اعتذل يَوْمُنَا (assumed tropical:)  <i>Our day became intensely hot;</i> as though it had been remiss, and made amends for its remissness by excess, blaming itself for what had proceeded from it.
