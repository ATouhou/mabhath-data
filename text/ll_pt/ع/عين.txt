I will not leave the thing when I see it ocularly, and seek the trace or vestige, thereof, after its [the thing&#39;s] disappearing from me: and the origin of it was the fact that a man saw the slayer of his brother, and when he desired to slay him, he [the latter] said, “ I will ransom myself with a hundred she-camels; ” whereupon he [the other] said, لَسْتُ <br>\
                  اَطْلُبُ اَثَرًا بَعْدَ عَيْنٍ; and slew him: (TA:) it is a prov., thus, or, as some relate it, لَا تَطْلُبْ. (Har p. 120.) ―         -b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  <i>Look,</i> or <i>view.</i> (K, TA.) It is said in the Kur [xx. 40], وَالتُصْنَعَ عَلَى عَيْنِى, (S, TA,) and it has been expl. as there having this meaning [i. e.

(Mgh.) They said, عَلَيْهِ مِايَةٌ عَيْنًا (assumed tropical:)  [<i>On him is</i> incumbent the payment of <i>a hundred deenars</i>]: but properly one should say عَيْنٌ, because it is identical with what precedes it (Sb, TA.) ―         -b5-  And The <i>half of a dánik</i> [app. <i>deducted</i>] <i>from seven deenars:</i> (K, TA:) mentioned by Az.
