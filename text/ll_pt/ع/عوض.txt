                   and عَوْضَ (Az, S, O, Mughnee, K) and عَوْضِ; (Mughnee, K,) the first accord. to Ks (TA) and the Koofees, and the second accord. to the Basrees; (O, TA; [in which latter it is added that the second is the most common; but this I think a mistake; for I have most frequently found the first; and in the Mughnee, عَوْضُ is mentioned first, as in the S and K, and عَوْضَ last;]) indecl., (Mughnee, K,) like قَبْلُ and اَيْنَ and اَمْسِ, (Mughnee,) without tenween; (S;) [but not always, as will be seen below;] an adv. n., (Mughnee, K,) denoting future time, (S, O,) or all future time, (Mughnee, K,) like as قَطُّ denotes past time; (S, O;) meaning <i>Ever;</i> syn. اَبَدًا; (S, * O, K;) but differing from ابَدًا by being appropriated to negative phrases only: (Mughnee, K: *) you say لَا اُفِارِقُكَ عَوْضُ, (K,) or عَوْضُ <br>\
                  لَا اُفَارِقُكَ, meaning <i>I will not separate myself from thee, ever;</i> like as you say قَطُّ مَا فَارَقْتُكَ; but you may not say عَوْضُ مَا فَارَقْتُكَ, like as you may not say قَطُّ مَا اُفَارِقُكَ: (S, O:) or it denotes past time also, having the same meaning: for you say, مَا <br>\
                  رَاَيْتُ مِثْلَهُ عَوْضُ, (AZ, K,) meaning <i>I have not seen the like of him,</i> or <i>it, ever:</i> (AZ:) so in the two books [the O and the TS] of Sgh: and in like manner a poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>And I have not seen a year, ever, more destructive</i>]. (TA.) But it is decl. when prefixed to another noun; as in the saying, لَا افْعَلُهُ عَوْضَ ↓ <br>\
      العَايِضِينَ (Mughnee, K) <i>I will not do it, ever;</i> (TA;) and ↓ <br>\
      لَا ا=تِيكَ عَوْضَ العَايِضِينَ [<i>I will not come to thee, ever</i>]; like as one says, دَهْرَ الدَّاهِرِينَ: (S, O:) [for in this case you may not say عَوْضُ.] And one also says افعل ذَاكَ مِنْ ذِى عَوْضٍ, [in which the first word is written in some copies of the S and K اِفْعَلْ, and in others اَفْعَلُ,] like as one says, مِنْ ذِى اُنُفٍ, (S, O, K,) and مِنْ ذِى <br>\
                  قَبَلٍ, (S, O,) meaning [<i>Do thou,</i> or <i>I will do, that</i>] <i>in what is</i> [<i>now</i>] <i>to be begun</i> [<i>of time;</i> meaning, <i>immediately:</i> see اُنُفٌ]: (S, O, K:) [thus making عوض decl., and using it without a negative, which must always accompany it when it is indecl.] [See also عِوَضٌ.] Or عَوْضُ signifies <i>Time;</i> syn. الدَّهْرُ (K) and الزَّمَانُ; (TA;) which is thus called because, as often as a portion thereof passes, it substitutes for it another portion: (Mughnee, K:) or, as some say, because they assert that it despoils and gives compensation. (Mughnee.) [See an ex. in the Ham p. 271, where it occurs in this sense with tenween, in the printed text, though said in the commentary to be indecl., with fet-h or with damm.] Or it is an oath; (Ibn-El-Kelbee, Mughnee, K,) and is (so in the O and Mughnee, but in the K “ or ”) the name of <i>A certain idol, belonging to Bekr Ibn-Wáïl:</i> (S, Mughnee, O, K:) as in a verse cited in art. مور: (O, Mughnee:) but if so, there is no reason for its being used indeclinably in a verse of El-Aashà cited voce اَسْحَمُ [q. v.]: (Mughnee:) or it is a word used in the manner of an oath; a man saying to his companion, عَوْضُ لَا يَكُونُ ذٰلِكَ <br>\
                  اَبَدًا [as though meaning <i>Nay, that will not,</i> or <i>shall not, be, ever</i>]: for if it were a noun signifying <i>time,</i> it would be with tenween; but it is a particle by which is meant an oath, like اَجَلْ and نَعَمْ. (Lth, O.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  </quote> (S, O, TA, in this art. and in art. عرض,) is of the measure فَاعِلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, like [the epithet in the phrase] عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ, (S, O, K,) meaning مَرْضِيَّةٌ: (S, O:) As says that the poet is addressing a woman whom he is desirous of marrying, saying, <i>Art thou in want,</i> (<i>and the gift appearing from thee shall have an exchange made for it</i> to thee by me) <i>of a hundred</i> <br>\
                  <i>camels</i> which I will assign to thee as a dowry, <i>some whereof the</i> [<i>quick</i>] <i>driver will abandon,</i> not being able to collect them together because of their large number? (S in art. عرض: [and the like is said in the O, as on the authority of Lth: but I have made a transposition in the explanation, directed in the TA, to make it agree with the order of the words of the verse:]) or the meaning is, <i>and the giver of a thing in exchange for</i> the enjoyment of <i>thee receiveth an exchange</i> from thee by marriage which is equal to that which he giveth in exchange for thee; عايض being from عِضْتُ, not from عُضْتُ: [so that, accord. to this explanation, it is used in the sense of its own proper measure, فَاعِلٌ:] but IB says that the phrase, in his poetry, is وَالعايِضُ مِنْكِ <br>\
                  عَايِضُ, meaning <i>the thing given in exchange by thee will be</i> [indeed] <i>a substitute,</i> or <i>a compensation;</i> like as you say الهِبَةُ مِنْكَ هِبَةٌ: (TA in art. عرض:) the verse is also related differently, with مِايَةٍ in the place of هَجْمَةٍ, and يُسْيِرُ in the place of يُغْدِرُ.
