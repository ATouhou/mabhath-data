(TA.) ―         -b10-  عَلِقَ بِهِ, inf. n. عَلَقٌ, <i>He contended with him in an altercation</i> [as though clinging to him]; <i>disputed with him;</i> or <i>litigated with him.</i> (TA.) ―         -b11-  لَا يَعْلَقُ بِكَ means لا يَلِيقُ بك [<i>It will not be suitable to thee; it will not befit thee</i>].

                  عضاه, [as though] hanging from it, by reason of his tallness: (S: in one of my copies of the S, and in the TA, يَعْلُقُ:) or one says, of camels, عَلَقَتْ مِنَ الشَّجَرِ, aor.      <br>\

(Msb.) One says also, عَلِقَتِ الاـِبِلُ, aor.      <br>\

      تعلّقت. (TA.) And عَلَقَ, inf. n. عَلَاقٌ and عُلُوقٌ, <i>He ate.</i> (TA.) And الصَّبِىُّ يَعْلُقُ <br>\
                  <i>The child sucks his fingers.</i> (TA.) ―         -b15-  عَلَقَهُ بِلِسَانِهِ [inf. n. عَلْقٌ] <i>He blamed,</i> or <i>censured, him; he said to him that which he disliked,</i> or <i>hated.</i> (Lh, K, * TA.) ―         -b16-  عَلِقَ اَمْرَهُ <br>\

Hence the saying, الغِرَاسُ تَبَدَّلُ بِالعُلُوقِ (tropical:)  [<i>The set,</i> or <i>shoot that is planted, becomes changed by pullulating</i>]; a metaphorical phrase; meaning that what is planted becomes changed because it increases and rises when it clings to the earth and germinates. (Mgh.) ―         -b18-  عَلِقَتِ الدَّابَّةُ <br>\
                  <i>The beast drank water and the leech</i> (العَلَقَةُ) <i>clave to it:</i> (S, O, K:) or, accord. to an explanation of [the part. n.] مَعْلُوقٌ by Lth, one says عُلِقَت, of the form of that whereof the agent is not named, meaning <i>it had leeches</i> (عَلَق) <i>that had taken hold upon its fauces when it drank:</i> (O:) or عُلِقَ, also, like عُنِىَ, is used in this sense, (K, * TA,) said of a man and of a beast.

      اعلقها [<i>He made his hands to cling,</i> &amp;amp;c.], followed by فى before the object: both signify the same. (TA.) And علّق الدَّابَّةَ, meaning علّق عَلَيْهَا [for علّق عليها <br>\
                  المِخْلَاةَ, agreeably with modern usage, i. e. <i>He hung upon the beast the nose-bag</i> containing barley, or the like; or <i>he supplied the beast with</i> <br>\
                  عَلِيق, which means <i>barley,</i> or <i>the like, that is hung upon the beast</i>]. (TA.) [And hence, as is indicated in the T and TA, علّق signifies, by a metaphor, (tropical:)  <i>He supplied with</i> <br>\
