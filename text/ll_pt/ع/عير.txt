                  , (S, O, Msb, K,) and عيّره بِهِ, though the former is the more approved, (ElMarzookee, in his Expos. of the Hamáseh, and Msb, and MF,) or the latter is peculiar to the vulgar, (S, and El-Hareeree in the Durrat el-Ghowwás.) and should not be used, (O, K,) inf. n. تَعْيِيرٌ, (S, O,) <i>He upbraided him with such a thing; reproached him for it; declared it to be bad, evil, abominable,</i> or <i>foal, and charged him with it.</i> (Msb.)

                  <i>He upbraided him,</i> or <i>reproached him, for his deed.</i>] And عيّر عَلَيْهِ [is an elliptical phrase, signifying the same; فِعْلَهُ or the like being understood: or <i>He upbraided him; charged him with acting disgracefully</i>].

The verb is [said to be] used in relation to measuring and weighing; but, says Az, Lth makes a distinction between عَايَرْتُ and عَيَّرْتُ, making the former to relate to a measure of capacity, and the latter to an instrument for weighing: and [SM adds,] F mentions the former in art. عور, and the latter in the present art.

      دَرَاهِمَ لِيُعَيِّرَ, meaning, [<i>He borrowed pieces of money</i>] <i>that he might equalize</i> [<i>with them the weights of his balance</i>], should be, correctly, لِيُعَايِرَ. (Mgh.) You say عَايَرْتُ المِكْيَالَ, and المِيزَانَ, inf. n. مُعَايَرَةٌ and عِيَارٌ, meaning <i>I tried,</i> or <i>proved, the measure of capacity,</i> and <i>the instrument for weighing,</i> [or <i>gauged the former,</i>] <i>that I might know its correctness</i> [or <i>incorrectness</i>]: this, says Az, is the correct form: one should not say ↓ <br>\

                  المِكْيَالَيْنِ signifies <i>I tried,</i> or <i>proved, the two measure of capacity, that I might know their equality</i> [or <i>inequality</i>]: you should not say المِيزَانَيْنِ ↓ <br>\
      عَيَّرْتُ, (Msb.) [But in the TA, الميزان ↓ <br>\
      عيّر and المكيال is mentioned without any remark of disapproval, with عاورهما and عايرهما.] You also say عاير بَيْنَهُمَا, inf. n. مُعَايَرَةٌ and عِيَارٌ, <i>He measured,</i> or <i>compared, them two. each by,</i> or <i>with, the other, and examined what</i> [<i>difference</i>] <i>was between them.</i> (K in art. عور.) ―         -b2-  [Hence, عاير app. signifies also <i>He assayed</i> gold &amp;amp;c.]       -A2-  See also 1, third sentence.    </entryFree> <br>\

                  عَيْرٌ. (AA, K.)       -A3-  اَعَارَتْ حَافِرًا means <i>She</i> (a mare) <i>raised and shifted a hoof;</i> ―         -b2-  and hence, accord. to Az, اـِعَارَةُ الثِّيَابِ [<i>The lending of garments</i>] &amp;amp;c. (L, TA. [See 4 in art. عور.])       -A4-  And اعارهُ is also said to signify <i>He fattened him;</i> namely, a horse: ―         -b2-  and <i>He plucked out the hair of his tail;</i> like اَعْرَاهُ: both of which meanings are mentioned by IKtt and others: ―         -b3-  and <i>i. q.</i> <br>\

                  حِمَارٍ [<i>It is more empty than the valley of Himar</i>]; (S, O, * TA;) for حمار was the name of a certain unbeliever, who possessed a valley, which for his infidelity, God rendered waste and unproductive; (O, * TA;) and Imra-el-Keys, (O, TA,) as some say, but correctly Taäbbata-sharrà, (O,) quoting the above-mentioned saying, has substituted العير for حمار, for the sake of the metre. (O, TA.) ―         -b4-  One says also اَذَلُّ مِنَ العَيْرِ <br>\
                  <i>More vile than the ass.</i> (TA.) [But this is doubtful: see the same phrase expl. differently later in this paragraph. The wild ass is superior to every other kind of animal that is an object of the chase: (see فَرَاٌ:) and hence, app., the signification here next following.] ―         -b5-  عَيْرٌ also signifies <i>A lord,</i> or <i>chief,</i> (S, O, K,) of a people: (S, O:) <i>a king:</i> (K:) pl. اَعْيَارٌ.

                  بُرْد: pl. عُيُورُ السَّرَاةِ: السَّرَاةُ being a place in the district of Et-Táïf: they assert that this bird eats three hundred figs, from the time of their coming forth from among the leaves, small; and in like manner, grapes. (TA.)       -A2-  Also The <i>prominence,</i> or <i>ridge, in the middle</i> of the iron head  or blade of an arrow or of a spear or of a sword or of a knife or the like. (S, O.)

(S, O.) ―         -b4-  The <i>prominent,</i> or <i>projecting, bone in the middle</i> of the hand: pl. اَعْيَارٌ. (TA.) [In the K, it is expl. simply by العَظْمُ النَّاتِيُ <br>\
                  وَسَطَهَا: but this is a wrong reading, app. occasioned by an omission, which is supplied in the TA, though somewhat awkwardly: it seems that we should read وَمِنَ الكَفِّ العَظْمُ النَّتِيُ وَسَطَهَا; or, more probably, ومن الكَتِفِ الخ; for I incline to think that الكفّ in the TA is a mistake for الكتف, and that the last signification of عير, given here, is doubtful.] ―         -b5-  The <i>prominence,</i> or <i>protuberance, in the upper,</i> or <i>convex, part,</i> or <i>back,</i> of the foot. (S, O, TA.) ―         -b6-  <i>Any prominent,</i> or <i>protuberant, bone in the body.</i> (TA.) ―         -b7-  <i>An edge,</i> or <i>a ridge,</i> of a rock, <i>naturally prominent.</i> (TA.) ―         -b8-  <i>Anything prominent,</i> or <i>protuberant, in an even thing,</i> (K,) or <i>in the middle of an even thing</i> [or <i>surface</i>].

[So called because it forms a kind of ridge.] ―         -b10-  The <i>prominent,</i> or <i>protuberant, part at the pupil</i> (بُوْبُو) <i>of the eye:</i> (AA, TA:) or the <i>lid</i> of the eye: (S, O, K:) or the <i>inner angle</i> [for مَاٰقِى, in the CK, I read مَاْقَى, as in other copies of the K,] of the eye: (Th, K:) or the <i>image that is seen in the black of the eye when a thing faces it;</i> (Aboo-Tálib, L, K; *) also called لُعْبَةٌ: (Aboo-Tálib, L:) or the <i>eye-ball:</i> (TA:) or <i>a looking from the outer angle</i> (لَحْظ [or perhaps this signifies here the <i>outer angle itself</i>]) <i>of the eye.</i> (K.) Hence the saying, (S, O,) فَعَلْتُ ذَاكَ <br>\

                  <i>I did that before a look from the outer angle of the eye:</i> (S, O, K: *) or <i>before he winked</i> [or <i>could wink</i>]; عير meaning the “ image that is seen in the black of the eye; ” and ما جرى, “ what moved, ” i. e., “ the eye itself: ” (Aboo-Tálib:) or <i>before I looked</i> [or <i>could look</i>] <i>at thee;</i> not used with a negative: (Th:) nor do you say اَفْعَلُ ذاك [instead of فعلت <br>\
                  ذاك in this phrase]: (A O, S:) or عير here signifies the <i>wild ass.</i> (Lh.) You say also اَتَيْتُكَ قَبْلَ <br>\
                  عَيْرٍ وَمَا جَرَى, meaning <i>I came to thee before a sleeper awoke</i> [or <i>could awake</i>].

(TA.)       -A3-  <i>A wooden pin, peg,</i> or <i>stake, which is fixed in the ground</i> or <i>in a wall.</i> (S, O, K.) Hence, as some say, the prov. فُلَانٌ اَذَلُّ مِنَ <br>\
                  العَيْرِ [<i>Such a one is more vile than the wooden pin,</i> or <i>peg, of a tent</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (TA.) [See another explanation above: and see also مَذَلَّةٌ.] Hence also, accord. to some, (TA,) one says, مَا اَدْرِى اَىُّ مَنْ <br>\
                  ضَرَبَ العَيْرَ هُوَ, meaning <i>I known not what one of mankind is he.</i> (Yaakoob, S, O, K, TA.) And hence too, as some say, the saying of El-Hárith Ibn-Hillizeh, (O, TA,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
