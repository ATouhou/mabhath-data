      عُوطَطٌ, which others hold to be a pl. of عَايِطٌ, (A&#39;Obeyd, S,) but Sb holds it to be a subst. having the sense of an inf. n., (TA,) and عَيْطٌ and عِيَاطٌ, (K,) <i>She</i> (a camel) <i>did not conceive in the first year after having been covered: nor in the next following year:</i> (S:) or <i>i. q.</i> ↓ <br>\

                   The <i>quality denoted by the epithet</i> <br>\

      عُوطَطٌ and ↓ <br>\
      عُوطُطٌ and عُيْطَطٌ [perhaps a mistake for عِيطَطٌ]. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                   A she-camel <i>not conceiving in the first year after having been covered:</i> (Ks, Az, S, O:) or a she-camel, (Lth, K,) and a woman, (K,) <i>not conceiving for several years, without being barren;</i> (Lth, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      مُعْتَاطٌ: (Lth, IAth, O, * TA:) and a she-camel <i>not conceiving when covered;</i> (K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      مُعْتَاطٌ, or ↓ <br>\
      مُعْتَاطَةٌ: (accord. to different copies of the K:) or <i>not conceiving when her womb has attained to maturity:</i> (TA:) ↓ <br>\
      مُعْتَاطٌ is also applied to a ewe or she-goat, as meaning <i>not conceiving, by reason of the abundance of her fat;</i> (IAth;) and occurs in a trad., so applied, (S, IAth,) and expl. as signifying اَلَّتِى لَمْ تَلِدْ <br>\
                  وَقَدْ حَانَ وِلَادُهَا; but by this is app. meant <i>that has not conceived, although the time for her conceiving has come:</i> (IAth:) the pl. of عَايِطٌ is عُوطٌ, (Ks, S, M, O, K,) which is also applied to women, and she-goats, (M,) and عِيطٌ (Ks, S, O, K) and عُيَّطٌ (M, O, K) and عَوَايِطُ (TA) and ↓ <br>\
      عُوطَطٌ [which is irregular, like حُولَلٌ,] (Ks, S, O, K) and عَوْطَطٌ (accord. to the CK) and عُوطُطٌ, (K,) but this is a dial. var. of عُوطَطٌ accord. to those who assert it to be an inf. n., (As, O, TA,) for some assert this last to be an inf. n., not a pl., and in like manner حُولَلٌ, (A&#39;Obeyd, S, O,) but Sb holds it to be a subst. in the sense of an inf. n., originally عُيْطَطٌ. (L, TA.) عَايِطُ عِيطٍ and عَايِطُ <br>\
                  عُوطٍ and ↓ <br>\
      عَايِطُ عُوطَطٍ (S, O, K) have an intensive signification, (K,) <i>Not conceiving in the first year after having been covered, nor in the next following year;</i> like حَايِلُ حُولٍ and حَايِلُ حُولَلٍ. (S, O.) [عِيطٌ is also pl. of اَعْيَطُ, which see in art. عيط.]    </entryFree> <br>\
