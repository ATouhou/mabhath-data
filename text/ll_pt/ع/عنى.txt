      مَعْنِيَّتُهُ, (K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously, مَعْنِيَتُهُ, without the sign of teshdeed,]) the last mentioned by ISd, (TA,) are one [in signification], (S, K, TA,) as <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  فَحْوَاهُ (TA, and so in some copies of the S,) and مَقْصَدُهُ [both of which are generally understood as signifying <i>the meaning,</i> or <i>intended sense, of the saying</i>]: (TA:) AHát says, the vulgar say, لِاَىِّ مَعْنًى فَعَلْتَ [<i>For what intent didst thou</i> such a thing?]; but the Arabs know not المَعْنَى, and never say it: this is the case: but some of the Arabs say, مَا <br>\

      مَعْنِىُّ [i. e. <i>What is the meaning,</i> or <i>intent,</i> (lit. <i>the meant</i> or <i>intended</i> object,) <i>of this?</i>], with kesr to the ن and with the ى musheddedeh: and AZ says, ذَاكَ ↓ <br>\
      هٰذَا فِى مَعْنَاةِ and فِى مَعْنَاهُ سَوَا=ءٌ, i. e. <i>This is</i> [used] <i>in a manner the like of that in respect of indication</i> and <i>import</i> and <i>acceptation:</i> El-Fárábee, also, says, مَعْنَى الشَّىْءِ and ↓ <br>\
      مَعْنَاتُهُ are one [in signification]; and مَعْنَاهُ and فَحْوَاهُ and مُقْتَضَاهُ and مَضْمُونُهُ all signify <i>that which the word,</i> or <i>expression,</i> [termed before <i>the thing,</i>] <i>indicates:</i> and it is said in the T, on the authority of Th, that المَعْنَى and التَّفْسِيرُ and التَّاْوِيلُ, are one [in signification, as meaning <i>explanation,</i> or <i>interpretation,</i> or <i>the like</i>]: and people have used their phrase هٰذَا مَعْنَى كَلَامِهِ, and the like, meaning <i>this is the import,</i> and <i>the indication of the meaning, of his saying;</i> which is agreeable with what is said by AZ and El-Fárábee: the grammarians and lexicologists, moreover, have agreed respecting a mode of expression of which they have made frequent use, their saying هٰذَا بِمَعْنَى <br>\
                  هٰذَا [<i>this is</i> used <i>with the meaning of this</i>], and هٰذَا وَهٰذَا فِى المَعْنَى وَاحِدٌ [<i>this and this are in meaning one</i>] and فِى المَعْنَى سَوَا=ءٌ [<i>in meaning alike</i>], and هٰذَا فِى مَعْنَى هٰذَا [<i>this is</i> used <i>in the sense of this</i>] i. e. <i>this is like this</i> [<i>in meaning</i>]: (Msb, TA:) the pl. of مَعْنًى is مَعَانٍ. (TA.) ―         -b2-  عِلْمُ المَعَانِى is expl. by El-Munáwee in the “ Towkeef ” as <i>The science whereby one knows how to express clearly one meaning in various ways:</i> (TA:) [but this definition is applied in the “ Talkhees ” (Talkhees el-Miftáh), and Hájjee Khaleefeh uses the same words with only one unimportant variation, in explaining عِلْمُ البَيَانِ; and a similar explanation of the latter is given in the Kull: in a marginal note in a copy of the Ksh, cited by De Sacy in his Anthol. Gr. Ar. p. 305, علم المعانى is expl. as <i>the science whereby is known the manner of adapting language to the requirements of the case;</i> (and it is similarly expl. in the “ Talkhees ” and other works;) and علم <br>\
                  البيان, as the science that concerns comparisons and tropes and metonymies.] ―         -b3-  [صُورَةٌ بِلَا مَعْنًى means <i>A form without any intrinsic quality.</i>] ―         -b4-  And المَعَانِى signifies also <i>The qualities that are commended,</i> or <i>approved;</i> [<i>the charms,</i> or <i>graces;</i>] <i>such as knowledge,</i> or <i>science,</i> and <i>piety,</i> and <i>generosity,</i> and <i>goodliness of make, &amp;amp;c.</i> (Har p. 644.)    </entryFree> <br>\
