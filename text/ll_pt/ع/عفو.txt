MF says that عَفَا is one of those verbs that have contr. significations, for at signifies <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, unapparent,</i> or <i>imperceptible</i> and also <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, apparent,</i> or <i>perceptible:</i> and it has two other contr. significations, which will be mentioned in what follows (TA.) ―         -b2-  And عَفْوٌ signifies also The act of <i>effacing, erasing, rasing,</i> or <i>obliterating.</i> (K, TA.) One says, عَفَتِ الرِّيحُ الاَثَرَ, (TA,) or المَنْزِلَ, (S, Msb,) and الدَّارَ, (TA,) <i>the wind effaced,</i> &amp;amp;c, (S, Msb, TA,) <i>the trace, vestige,</i> or <i>footprint,</i> (TA,) or <i>the place of alighting,</i> or <i>abode,</i> (S, Msb,) and <i>the house,</i> or <i>dwelling,</i> or  <br>\

                  الدَّارَ, (S, TA,) inf. n. تَعْفِيَةٌ, (TA,) in which the verb is with teshdeed to denote intensiveness [of the signification, i. e. <i>the wind effaced,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>mightily,</i> or <i>utterly, the house,</i> or <i>dwelling,</i> or <i>abode</i>]: (S, TA:) and عَلَى اَثَرِهِ ↓ <br>\

                  <i>It,</i> or <i>he, effaced its,</i> or <i>his, trace, vestige,</i> or <i>footprint.</i> (MA.) ―         -b3-  Hence, as some say, عَفَا اْللّٰهُ عَنْكَ i. e. <i>May God efface</i> [<i>from thee</i> thy sin, &amp;amp;c.; meaning <i>may God absolve thee</i>]; (TA;) or <i>may God efface thy sins:</i> (Msb:) [and عُفِىَ عَنْهُ <br>\
                  <i>May he be absolved,</i> or <i>forgiven,</i> or <i>pardoned:</i>] and hence the saying in a trad., سَلُوا اْللّٰهَ العَفْوَ i. e. [<i>Ask ye of God</i>] <i>the effacement of sin;</i> [or <i>ask ye of God absolution,</i> or <i>forgiveness,</i> or <i>pardon;</i>] and ↓ <br>\
      المُعَافَاةَ, and ↓ <br>\
      العَافِيَةَ [which have a similar meaning: see 3]: (TA:) and one says, عَفَوْتُ عَنْ ذَنْبِهِ, meaning <i>I left him, and did not punish him:</i> (S:) or عَفَوْتُ عَنْهُ and عَفَوْتُ عَنْ ذَنْبِهِ and عَفَوْتُ <br>\
                  لَهُ عَنْ ذَنْبِهِ i. e. <i>I turned away from him,</i> or <i>from his crime, sin, fault,</i> or <i>offence;</i> syn. صَفَحْتُ عَنْهُ; and <i>I turned away</i> (اَعْرَضْتُ) <i>from punishing him:</i> (Mgh:) or العَفْوُ signifies <i>the turning away</i> (الصَّفْحُ, K, TA) from the committer of a crime or the like; (TA;) and <i>the relinquishing the punishment of the deserving</i> [<i>thereof</i>]: and one says, عَفَا عَنْهُ and عَفَا لَهُ ذَنْبَهُ and عَنْ ذَنْبِهِ [<i>he turned away from him,</i> or <i>from his crime,</i> &amp;amp;c; and <i>relinquished the infliction of his merited punishment,</i> i. e. <i>forgave him,</i> or <i>pardoned him</i>]: (K, TA:) or عَفَا عَنْهُ ذَنْبَهُ and عَفَا لَهُ ذَنْبَهُ and عَنْ ذَنْبِهِ: (so accord. to the CK:) accord. to MF, the primary signification of العَفْوُ is التَّرْكُ: but this is not the case: and الصَّفْحُ [by which it is expl. in the K] is [or rather implies] the relinquishing of blame, or reproof, or of severe, or angry, blame or reproof; and this is more than [is signified by] العَفْوُ, for the latter is sometimes without the former: the primary signification of العَفْوُ [when trans.] is [said to be] <i>the purposing to take a</i> thing; and Er-Rághib says that عَفَوْتُ عَنْكَ is as though it meant <i>I have purposed to remove</i> [or <i>to take away</i>] <i>thy crime</i> or <i>the like:</i> (TA:) [but I think that the primary signification of العَفْوُ when its object is a crime or the like is that of <i>effacement:</i> and hence likewise what next follows:] ―         -b4-  العَفْوُ is also metaphorically used as meaning (tropical:)  <i>The withdrawing</i> from a right, or due, and from seeking, or demanding, it: and thus the verb is used in the Kur ii. 238 [q. v.]: and in the saying of the Prophet, عَفَوْنَا لَكُمْ عَنْ صَدَقَةِ الخَيْلِ وَالرَّقِيقِ [i. e. (tropical:)  <i>We have remitted to you the poor-rate of horses and of the slave</i> or <i>slaves</i>]: (Mgh:) [and hence] عَفَوْتُ عَنِ الحَقِّ means (assumed tropical:)  <i>I have annulled</i> [or <i>remitted</i>] <i>the right,</i> or <i>due;</i> as though I erased it from [the account of] him who owed it: (Msb:) and عَفَوْتُ لَهُ عَنْ مَا لِى عَلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>I have relinquished</i> [or <i>remitted</i>] <i>to him what was due to me on his part.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  عَفَا signifies also <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, much in quantity,</i> or <i>many in number:</i> (Msb, MF, TA:) and also the contr., i. e. <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, little in quantity,</i> or <i>few in number.</i> (MF, TA.) It is said in the former sense of hair, and of herbage, &amp;amp;c.: (S:) or, said of hair, <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, long, and much in quantity;</i> (TA;) and said of the hair of a camel, (K,) or of the hair of a camel&#39;s back, (TA,) <i>it became abundant and long, and covered his rump;</i> (K, TA;) and said of herbage, <i>it was,</i> or <i>became, much in quantity, and tall.</i> (TA.) And عَفَوْا in the Kur vii. 93 means <i>They became many,</i> or <i>numerous.</i> (S, Msb.) And عَفَتِ الاَرْضُ <br>\
                  <i>The land became covered with herbage.</i> (K and TK. [In the CK, والارضَ is erroneously put for وَالاَرْضُ.]) ―         -b2-  And عَفَوْتُهُ <br>\
                  <i>I made it to become much in quantity,</i> or <i>many in number;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      اَعْفَيْتُهُ; (S, * Msb, TA; *) and so ↓ <br>\
      عَفَّيْتُهُ. (TA.) Accord. to Es-Sarakustee, one says, عَفَوْتُ الشَّعَرَ, aor. اَعْفُوهُ, inf. n. عَفْوٌ; and عَفَيْتُهُ, aor. اَعْفِيهِ, inf. n. عَفَىٌ; meaning <i>I left the hair to become abundant and long.</i> (Msb.) And one says, اللِّحْيَةَ ↓ <br>\
      اعفى <br>\
                  <i>He left the beard to become abundant and long,</i> (Mgh, K, TA,) <i>having ceased from cutting it:</i> (Mgh:) whence, (TA,) it is said in a trad., اَمَرَ اَنْ تُحْفَى <br>\
                  الشَّوَارِبُ وَتُعْفَى اللُّحَى [<i>He commanded that the mustaches should be clipped closely,</i> or <i>much, and that the beards should be left to become abundant and long</i>]: (S, TA:) or اَحْفُوا الشَّوَارِبَ وَاَعْفُوا <br>\
                  اللِّحَى [<i>Clip ye</i> &amp;amp;c.], and one may also use the unaugmented verb [saying وَاْعْفُوا, from عَفَا]. (Msb, TA.) And شَعَرَ البَعِيرِ ↓ <br>\
      اَعْفَيْتُ, (K,) or شَعَرَ ظَهْرِ البَعِيرِ, (TA,) <i>I left the hair of the camel,</i> or <i>the hair of the back of the camel, to become abundant and long;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      عَفَّيْتُهُ; (K, TA;) this latter with teshdeed. (TA. [In the CK, عَفَيْتُهُ.]) عَفَا الصُّوفَ, expl. in the K as signifying <i>He shore,</i> or <i>sheared, the wool,</i> signifies <i>he left the wool to become abundant and long, then shore,</i> or <i>sheared, it.</i> (TA.)       -A3-  Also, inf. n. عَفْوٌ, <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  فَضَلَ or <i>superfluous;</i> or <i>it remained over and above</i>]. (Msb.) You say, خُذْ مَا صَفَا وَعَفَا, [correctly, مَا <br>\
                  عَفَا وَصَفَا,] meaning فَضَلَ وَتَسَهَّلَ [i. e. <i>Take thou what has exceeded,</i> or <i>become redundant, and has become facilitated</i>]. (Mgh.) ―         -b2-  [And <i>He exceeded.</i>] You say, عَفَا عَلَيْهِ فِى العِلْمِ <br>\
                  <i>He exceeded him in knowledge;</i> syn. زَادَ. (K.) And هُوَ يَعْفُو <br>\

                  <i>He gave to him fully,</i> or <i>wholly, his right,</i> or <i>due.</i> (Har p. 117.) ―         -b4-  And عَفَوْتُ لَهُ مِنَ المَرَقِ <br>\
                  <i>I laded out for him first, and gave to him in preference, some of the broth.</i> (S. [See عِفَاوَةٌ.]) ―         -b5-  And عَفَوْتُ القِدْرَ <br>\
