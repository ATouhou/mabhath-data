      نيّا, accord. to the K, signifies <i>the same:</i> but this is unknown, and not authorized by transmission [from the Arabs of the classical ages], and therefore not mentioned by IM nor by other leading lexicographers: the correct phrases are [when the verb is intrans.] ناء الامرُ [and اللحمُ], and [when it is trans.] اناء اللحمَ [and الامر]: the forms of the verb being like بَانَ and اَبَانَ.
