[It is said in the K, that النَّقْضُ is the contr. of الاـِبْرَامُ, like الاـِنْتقَاضُ and التَّنَاقُضُ: but this is a glaring mistake; and seems to be a corruption of the following passage in the M: النَّقْضُ ضِدُّ <br>\
                  الاـِبْرَامِ نَقَضَهُ يَنْقُضُهُ نَقْضًا وَاْنْتَقَضَ وَتَنَاقَضَ, which is meant indicate that انتقض and تناقض are quasi-passives of نَقَضَهُ: and in like manner, the passage in the A, النَّقْضُ فِى البِنَا=ءِ وَالحَبْلِ وَغَيْرِهِ <br>\
                  ضِدُّ الاـِبْرَامِ وَاْنْتَقَضَ وَنَتَقَّضَ, indicates that انتقض and تنقّض are quasi-passives of نَقَضَهُ. Further. it should be observed that نَقَضَهُ, as relating to a building, is not well explained by هَدَمَهُ; for you say, نَقَضَ البِنَا=ءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ هَدْمٍ, (mentioned in the S and A, &amp;amp;c., in art. قوض,) meaning <i>He took to pieces the building without demolishing,</i> or <i>destroying.</i>] ―         -b2-  [Hence,] نَقَصَ فُلَانٌ وَتَرَهُ [lit. <i>Such a one undid,</i> or <i>untwisted, his bow-string</i>]; meaning (tropical:)  <i>such a one took,</i> or <i>had taken, his blood-revenge.</i> (A, TA.) And الدَّهْرُ ذُو نَقْضٍ <br>\
                  وَاـِمْرَارٍ [lit. <i>Time,</i> or <i>fortune, has a property of untwisting and twisting tightly</i>]; meaning (tropical:)  <i>that which time,</i> or <i>fortune,</i> [as it were] <i>twists tightly,</i> [or <i>makes firm.</i>] <i>it,</i> at another time, [as it were] <i>untwists,</i> or <i>undoes.</i> (TA.)

And يَنْقُضُ عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  [<i>He undoes,</i> or <i>annuls,</i> or <i>contradicts, what he</i> (another) <i>has said</i>]; said of a poet replying to another poet. (Lth, A, K.) ―         -b3-  نقض السقف, [i. e., app., نَقْضُ السَّقْفِ,] also signifies تحريك خشبه [i. e. تَحْرِيكُ خَشَبِهِ, The <i>moving,</i> or <i>shaking, of the pieces of wood,</i> or <i>rafters, of the roof</i>].

      نَقَّضَهَا, inf. n. تَنْقِيضٌ: (see فَرْقَعَ:)] or <i>he struck with his fingers in order that they might make a sound,</i> or <i>sounds:</i> (K:) if it mean cracking of the joints (فَرْقَعَة), it is disapproved; but if clapping, it is not. (TA.) And انقض العِلْكَ <br>\
                  <i>He caused the</i> [<i>kind of gum called</i>] علك <br>\
                  <i>to make a sound,</i> or <i>sounds;</i> [i. e., in chewing it, as many women do;] the doing of which is disapproved. (S, L, K. [But in the S and L, it said that اـِنْقَاضُ العِلْكَ signifies تَصْوِيتُهُ, which does not necessarily indicate that the former verb is transitive.]) ―         -b2-  Hence, (S, M, TA,) انقض الحِمْلُ ظَهْرَهُ (S, M, A, Msb, K *) <i>The load made his back to sound by reason of its weight:</i> (M:) or <i>pressed heavily upon him,</i> (S, M, Msb, K,) <i>so that his back was heard to make a sound such as is termed</i> <br>\

                  الدَّمُ, explained by تَقَطَّرَ; [as though meaning <i>The blood was made to drop, drip,</i> or <i>fall in drops;</i>] but how likely is this to be a mistranscription. (TA.) [The right reading of the phrase is probably تنقّض الكَمْءُ; and of the explanation, تَفَطَّرَ; and if so, the phrase is like اَنْقَضَ الكَمْءُ, and نَقَّضَ, explained above: see 4, second sentence.] ―         -b3-  تنقّض الَبْيتُ <br>\
                  <i>The house,</i> or <i>chamber, became cleft,</i> or <i>cracked, in several places, so as to cause a sound to be heard</i> (K, TA.) And تنقّض is also said of a building, [app. in the same sense,] like ↓ <br>\
      نَقَّضَ. (TA.) [See نَقَّضَ السَّقْفُ, in 1, next before the last break.] You say also, تنقّضت عِظَامُهُ (tropical:)  <i>His bones made a sound</i> [app. <i>in being broken</i>]. (IF, K, TA.) [See also 4.]    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>cannot be coëxistent in the same thing, nor simultaneously nonexistent in the same thing</i>]; as existence itself and nonexistence, and motion and rest. (Kull, pp. 231, 232) You say also, هٰذِهِ قَصِيدَةٌ نَقِيضُ قَصِيدَةِ <br>\
                  فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  [<i>This poem is a contradictor of the poem of such a one</i>]. (A.) And النَّقِيضَةُ in poetry is (tropical:)  <i>That by which one undoes</i> or <i>annuls</i> or <i>contradicts</i> [<i>what another poet has said</i>]: (S:) or نَقِيضَةُ الشِّعْرِ <br>\
                  <i>consists in a poet&#39;s putting forth poetry, and another poet&#39;s undoing</i> or <i>annulling</i> or <i>contradicting it, by putting forth what is different therefrom:</i> (Lth, K, * TA:) the subst is نَقِيضٌ: [or rather this seems to be an epithet in which the quality of a subst. is predominant, and syn. with نَقِيضَةٌ:] and the act of the two is termed ↓ <br>\
      مُنَاقَضَةٌ: the pl. of نَقِيضَةٌ is نَقَايِضُ: (TA:) you speak of the نَقَايِض of Jereer and El-Farezdak. (A, TA.)       -A2-  <i>A sound, noise, voice,</i> or <i>cry;</i> (Lth, S, M, O, K:) as also ↓ <br>\
