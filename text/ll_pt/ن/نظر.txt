                  , (M, A, &amp;amp;c.,) and اَنْطُورٌ is substituted for اَنْظُرُ in the dial. of certain Arabs, (IDrd, TS, K,) or, accord. to Lb, in the Bughyetel-Ámál, the و is here added only [by poetic license,] to make the sound of the dammeh full, agreeably with other instances; (TA;) and نَظِرَ اـِلَيْهِ, and نَظِرَهُ, aor.      <br>\

                  , (A, K,) the verb being like سَمِعَ accord. to the correct copies of the K, [and so in the A,] but in one copy of the K, like ضَرَبَ; (TA;) inf. n. نَظَرٌ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) and نَظْرٌ is allowable, as a contraction of the former, (Lth,) and نَظَرَانٌ (S, K,) and مَنْظَرٌ (M, A, K) and مَنْظَرَةٌ and تَنْظارٌ, (M, K,) [which last is an intensive form; <i>He looked at,</i> or <i>towards, in order to see, him,</i> or <i>it;</i>] <i>he considered,</i> or <i>viewed, him</i> or <i>it with his eye;</i> (S, A, K;) <i>with the sight of the eye;</i> (Msb;) [i. e. <i>looked at him</i> or <i>it;</i>] as also ↓ <br>\
      تنظّرهُ: (K:) and ↓ <br>\
      انتظرهُ signifies the same as تنظّرهُ and نَظَرَهُ [but app. in another sense, to be mentioned below, and not in the sense explained above, though the latter is implied in the TA; and the same may be meant when it is said that ↓ <br>\
      تنظّر is syn. with نَظَرَ, if this assertion, which I find in the M, have been copied  without consideration, and be not confirmed by an example]: (TA:) or نَظَرَ اـِلَيْهِ signifies <i>he extended,</i> or <i>stretched,</i> or <i>raised,</i> [or <i>directed,</i>] <i>his sight towards him</i> or <i>it, whether he saw him</i> or <i>did not see him.</i> (TA.) The usage of النَّظَرٌ as relating to the sight is most common with the vulgar, but not with persons of distinction, who use it more in another sense, to be explained below. (TA.) You say, نَظَرَ اـِلَيْهِ نَظْرَةً حُلْوَةً [<i>He looked at him,</i> or <i>towards him, with one sweet look.</i>] (A.) And نَظَرَ فِى المِنْظَارِ [<i>He looked in the mirror</i>]. (A.) And نَظَرَ فِى الكِتَابِ [<i>He looked into,</i> or <i>inspected, the writing</i> or <i>book</i>], (A, Msb,) which is for نَظَرَ المَكْتُوبَ فِى الكِتَابِ [<i>he looked at what was written in the writing</i> or <i>book</i>], or has a different meaning to be explained below. (Msb.) And هُوَ يَنْظُرُ حَوْلَهُ [lit., <i>He looks around him;</i> meaning,] <i>he looks much.</i> (A.) [See also نَظَرٌ below.] ―         -b2-  نَظَرَتِ الاَرْضُ, (Sgh, K,) and نَظَرَتِ الاَرْضُ بِعَيْنٍ, and بِعَيْنَيْنِ, (A,) (tropical:)  <i>The earth,</i> or <i>land, showed</i> (A, Sgh, K) <i>to the eye</i> (Sgh, K) <i>its plants</i> or <i>herbage.</i> (A, Sgh, K.) ―         -b3-  نَظَرَ اـِلَيْهِ (tropical:)  <i>It looked towards,</i> meaning <i>faced, him</i> or <i>it.</i> So in the Kur, [vii. 197,] وَتَرَاهُمْ يَنْظُرُونَ اـِلَيْكَ وَهُمْ <br>\
                  لَا يُبْصِرُونَ (tropical:)  <i>Thou seest them look towards thee,</i> i. e., <i>face thee, but they see not;</i> referring to idols, accord. to A&#39;Obeyd. (TA.) And you say, دَارِى يَنْظُرُ اـِلَى دَارِ فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  <i>My house faces the house of such a one.</i> (S.) And نَظَرَ اـِلَيْكَ الجَبَلُ (tropical:)  <i>The mountain faced thee:</i> (A:) as in the following ex.: اـِذَا اَخَذْتَ فِى طَرِيقِ كَذَا فَنَظَرَ اـِلَيْكَ الجَبَلُ فَخُذْ <br>\
                  عَنْ يَمِينِهِ اَوْيَسَارِهِ (tropical:)  [<i>When thou takest such a road, and the mountain faces thee, then take thou the way by the right of it</i> or <i>the left of it.</i>] (S.) ―         -b4-  [Hence, perhaps,] نَظَرَ الدَّهْرُ اـِلَى بَنِى فُلَانٍ <br>\
                  فَاَهْلَكَهُمْ [app. meaning, (assumed tropical:)  <i>Fortune opposed the sons of such a one and destroyed them</i>]: (S [immediately following there the ex. which immediately precedes it here:]) or نَظَرَ اـِلَيْهِمُ الدَّهْرُ signifies (tropical:)  <i>Fortune destroyed them:</i> (M, A:) but (says ISd) I am not certain of this. (M.) ―         -b5-  النَّظَرُ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>The turning the mind in various directions in order to perceive</i> a thing [mentally], and <i>the seeing</i> a thing: and sometimes it means (assumed tropical:)  <i>the considering and investigating:</i> [and as a subst., <i>speculation,</i> or <i>intellectual examination:</i>] and sometimes, (assumed tropical:)  <i>the knowledge that results from</i> [<i>speculation</i> or] <i>investigation.</i> (El-Basáïr.) It is mostly used as relating to the intellect by persons of distinction; and as relating to the sight, most commonly by the vulgar. (TA.) [It is said that] when you say نَظَرْتُ اـِلَيْهِ, it means only [<i>I looked at,</i> or <i>towards, him or it</i>] <i>with the eye:</i> but when you say نَظَرْتُ فِى الاَمْرِ, it may mean [(assumed tropical:)  <i>I looked into, inspected, examined,</i> or <i>investigated, the thing</i> or <i>affair</i>] <i>by thought and consideration, intellectually,</i> or <i>with the mind:</i> (TA:) [this remark, however, is not altogether correct, as may be seen from what follows: the truth seems to be, that نَظَرَهُ and نَظَرَاـِلَيْهِ may be used in the latter of these two senses, though نَظَرَ فِيهِ is most common in this sense.] It is said in the Kur, [x. 101,] قُلِ اْنْظُرُوا مَا ذَا فِى السَّمٰوَاتِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Say, Consider ye what is in the heavens.</i> (TA.) And you say, نَظَرَ اـِلَيْهِ <br>\
                  <i>He saw it, and</i> (assumed tropical:)  <i>thought upon it, and endeavoured to understand it,</i> or <i>to know its result.</i> (TA.) [And <i>He looked to it,</i> or <i>at it,</i> or <i>examined it, intellectually; regarded it; had a view to it.</i>] And نَظَرَ فِيهِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He considered it:</i> (TA:) or <i>thought upon it;</i> namely a writing or book; or when such is the object it may have another meaning, explained before; and an affair: and with this is held to accord the saying وَفِيهِ نَظَرٌ, q. v. infrà, voce نَظَرٌ: (Msb:) and (tropical:)  <i>he though upon it, measuring it,</i> or <i>comparing it.</i> (M, K, TK. In the M and K, only the inf. n., نَظَرَ فِى اَمْوَالِ الاَيْتَامِ, of the verb in this sense is mentioned.) And فَنَطَرَ نَظْرَةً فِى النُّجُومِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He considered,</i> or <i>examined,</i> [or <i>estimated,</i>] <i>the possessions of the orphans, in order to know them.</i> (Msb.) And similar to this is the phrase [in the Kur, xxxvii. 86,] النَّظَرُ, meaning, (assumed tropical:)  <i>And he examined the science of the stars:</i> (Msb:) [or <i>he took a mental view of the stars,</i> as if to divine from them.] الاِعْتِبَارُ when used unrestrictedly by those who treat of scholastic theology means الاِعْتِبَارُ [(assumed tropical:)  <i>The thinking upon a thing, and endeavouring to understand it,</i> or <i>to know its result;</i> or <i>judging of what is hidden from what is apparent;</i> or <i>reasoning from analogy</i>]. (MF.) ―         -b6-  نَظَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ, inf. n. نَظَرٌ, [app. for نَظَرَ فِى مَا <br>\
                  بَيْنَهُمْ,] (assumed tropical:)  <i>He judged between them.</i> (K.) ―         -b7-  نَظَرَتْ, (TA,) inf. n. نَظَرٌ, (assumed tropical:)  <i>She practised divination;</i> (K, * TA;) which is a kind of examination with insight and skill. (TA, from a trad.) ―         -b8-  اُنْظُرْ لِى فُلَانًا (tropical:)  [<i>look thou out for such a one for me;</i>] <i>seek thou for me such a one.</i> (A, TA.) ―         -b9-  اُنْظُرْنِى (assumed tropical:)  <i>Listen thou to me.</i> (M, K, TA [in the CK, erroneously, اُنْطِرْنِى.]) The verb [says ISd] has this meaning in the Kur, ii. 98. (M.) ―         -b10-  اَنَا اَنْظُرُ اـِلَى اْللّٰهِ ثُمَّ اـِلَيْكَ [lit., <i>I look to God, then to thee;</i> meaning,] (tropical:)  <i>I look for the bounty of God, then for thy bounty.</i> (A.) ―         -b11-  نَظَرَ اْللّٰهُ اـِلَيْهِ (tropical:)  <i>God chose him, and compassionated him, pitied him,</i> or <i>regarded him with mercy;</i> because looking at another is indicative of love, and not doing so is indicative of hatred: (IAth:) or (assumed tropical:)  <i>God bestowed benefits upon him; poured blessings,</i> or <i>favours, upon him:</i> (El-Basáïr:) and نَظَرَ لَهُمْ (tropical:)  <i>he compassionated them, and aided them;</i> (Sgh, K;) and simply, <i>he aided them:</i> (K, * TA:) and نَظَرَ لَهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>he accomplished his want,</i> or <i>that which he</i> (another) <i>wanted.</i> (Msb.)       -A2-  نَظَرَهُ is also syn. with ↓ <br>\

      نَظَّرَهُ; (so in a copy of the M, and in the CK; but from the mention of the inf. n. in the TA, the former seems to be the right reading;) <i>He sold it</i> (a thing, M) <i>with postponement of the payment; he sold it upon credit.</i> (M, * K, * TA.) See also 4. ―         -b4-  [In these last three acceptations, accord. to the A, the verb is used properly, not tropically.]       -A3-  نُظِرَ <br>\
