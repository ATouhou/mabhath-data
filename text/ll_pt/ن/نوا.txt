<b>نَوْءٌ</b>               1     <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                  , pl. اَنْوَا=ءٌ and نُوا=نٌ, (S, K,) <i>A star,</i> or <i>an asterism, verging to setting:</i> or the <i>setting of the star,</i> or <i>asterism, in the west, aurorally, i. e., at dawn of morning,</i> and the <i>rising of another, opposite to it, at the same time, in the east:</i> (K:) or the <i>setting of one of the stars,</i> or <i>asterisms, which compose the Mansions</i> [<i>of the Moon</i> (see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ)], <i>in the west, aurorally,</i> i. e., <i>at dawn of morining, and</i> the <i>rising of its</i> <br>\
                  رَقِيب, <i>which is another star,</i> or <i>asterism, opposite to it, at the same time, in the east, each night for a period of thirteen days:</i> thus does each star, or asterism, of those Mansions, [one after another,] to the end of the year, except الجَبْهَة, the period of which is fourteen days: (S:) [or it signifies the <i>auroral rising,</i> and sometimes the <i>auroral setting, of one of those stars,</i> or <i>asterisms;</i> as will be shown below: I do not say “ heliacal ” rising because the rising here meant continues for a period of thirteen days]. Accord. to the T, نوء signifies the <i>setting</i> of one of the stars, or asterisms, above mentioned: and AHn says, that it signifies its <i>first setting in the morning, when the stars are about to disappear; which is when the whiteness of dawn diffuses itself.</i> (TA.) A&#39;Obeyd says, I have not heard نوء used in the sense of “ setting, ” “ falling, ” except in this instance. (S.) It is added, [whether on his or another&#39;s authority is doubtful,] that the [pagan] Arabs used to attribute the rains and winds and heat and cold to such of the stars, or asterisms, above mentioned as was <i>setting</i> at the time [<i>aurorally</i>]; or, accord. to As, to that which was <i>rising in its ascendency</i> [<i>aurorally</i>]; and used to say, مُطِرْنَا بِنَوْءِ كَذَا [<i>We have been given rain by such a</i> <br>\
                  نوء]; (S;) or they attributed heat [and cold] to the <i>rising</i> or the star or asterism, and rain [and wind], to its نَوْء [meaning its <i>setting</i>]. (AHn, Har, p. 216.) This the Muslim is forbidden to say, unless he mean thereby, “ We have been given rain at the period of such a نوء; ” God having made it usual for rain to come at [certain of] the periods called انواء. Again, A&#39;Obeyd says, The انواء are <i>twenty-eight stars,</i> or <i>asterisms;</i> sing. نوء: the <i>rising</i> of any one of them in the east [<i>aurorally</i>] is called نوء; and the <i>star,</i> or <i>asterism,</i> itself is hence thus called: but sometimes نوء signifies the <i>setting.</i> Also, in the L it is said, that each of the abovementioned stars, or asterisms, is called thus because, when that in the west sets, the opposite one rises; and this <i>rising</i> is called النّوء; but some make نوء to signify the <i>setting;</i> as if it bore contr. senses. (TA.) [El-Kazweenee mentions certain physical occurrences on the occasions of the انواء of the Mansions of the Moon; and in each of these cases, except three, the نوء is the <i>rising,</i> not the setting. Two of the excepted cases are doubtful: the passage relating to the third plainly expresses an event which happens at the period of the <i>auroral setting</i> of الصَّرْفَة; namely the commencement of the days called اَيَّامُ العَجُوزِ; corresponding, accord. to ElMakreezee, with the rising of الفَرْغُ المُقَدَّمُ, the رقيب of الصرفة: and it is said in the S, art. عجز, on the authority of Ibn-Kunáseh, that the ايّام <br>\
                  العجوز fall at the period of the نوء of الصرفة. (The auroral setting of الصرفة, at the commencement of the era of the Flight, in central Arabia, happened about the 9th of March O. S.; and this is the day of the N. S., the 26th of February O. S., on which commence the ايّام <br>\
                  العجوز accord. to the modern Egyptian almanacs.) Hence it appears, that <i>sometimes the setting,</i> but <i>generally the rising,</i> was called the نوء. Moreover, the ancient Arabs had twenty-eight proverbial sayings (which are quoted in the Mir-át ez-Zemán, and in the work of El-Kazweenee) relating to the <i>risings</i> of the twenty-eight Mansions of the Moon: such as this: اـِذَا طَلَعَ الشَّرَطَانْ <br>\
                  اـِسْتَوَى الزَّمَانْ “ When Esh-Sharatán rises, the season becomes temperate: ” or, perhaps, “ ―         -b2-  the night and day, become equal. ” (If this latter meaning could be proved to be the right one, we might infer that the Calendar of the Mansions of the Moon was in use more than twelve centuries B. c.; and that for this reason الشرطان was called the first of the mansions; though it may have been first so called at a later period as being the first Mansion in the first Sign of the Zodiac. But I return to the more immediate object which I had in view in mentioning the foregoing sayings.) I do not find any of these sayings (though others, I believe, do) relating to the settings. Hence, again, it appears most probable, that the <i>rising,</i> not the setting, was generally called نوء.] ―         -b3-  [In many instances,] الاَنْوَا=ءُ signifies <i>The Mansions of the Moon</i> [themselves]; and نَوْءٌ, any <i>one of those Mansions:</i> and they are also called نُجُومُ المَطَرِ [<i>the stars,</i> or <i>asterisms, of rain</i>]. (Mgh, in art. خطا.) IAar says that the term نوء was not applied except in the case of a star, or asterism, accompanied by rain: (TA:) [see exs. under خَطَّ and خَطَّاَ: but most authors, it seems, apply this term without such restriction: it is sometimes given to <i>certain stars</i> or <i>asterisms, which do not belong to the Mansions of the Moon;</i> as will be seen below: and it is applied, with the article, especially to الثُّرَيَّا]. ―         -b4-  Accord. to AZ, as cited by AM, the first rain is that called الوَسْمِىُّ: the انواء of which are those called العَرْقُوَتَانِ المُوَخَّرَتَان, the same, says AM, as الفَرْغُ <br>\
                  المُوَخَّرُ, [the 27th Mansion of the Moon, which, about the period of the commencement of the era of the Flight, (to which period, or thereabout, the calculation of AZ, here given, most probably relates,) set aurorally, (for by the term نوء AZ means a star or asterism, at the <i>setting</i> of which rain usually falls,) in central Arabia, on the 21st of Sept. O. S, as shewn in the observations on  the منازل القمر in this lexicon]: then, الشَّرَطُ, [one of the شَرَطَانِ, the 1st Mansion, which, about the period above mentioned, set aurorally on the 17th of Oct.]: then, الثُّرَيَّا, [the 3rd Mansion, which, about that period, set on the 12th of Nov.]. Then comes the rain called الشَّتَوِىُّ: the انواء of which are الجَوْزَاءُ [meaning الهَقْعَةُ, the 5th Mansion, which, about the period above mentioned, set aurorally on the 8th of Dec.] then, الذِّرَاعَانِ, [i. e. الذِّرَاعُ المَقْبُوضَةُ and الدِّرَاعُ <br>\
                  المَبْسُوطَةُ; the former of which, about the same period, set anti-heliacally on the 3rd of January, the proper relative time of the setting of the 7th Mansion; and the latter, on the 16th of January, the proper relative time of the setting of the 8th Mansion;] and their نَثْرَة, [the 8th Mansion, which, about that period, set aurorally on the 16th of Jan.]: then, الجَبْهَةُ, [the 10th Mansion, which set aurorally, about that period, on the 11th of Feb.] In this period the شتوى rain ends; and that called الدَّفَيِىُّ (q. v.) begins, and [after this] الصَّيْفُ. All the rains from the وسمى to the دفيى are called رَبِيعٌ. Then, [after the دفيى,] comes the صَيْف: the انواء of which are السِّمَاكَانِ (الاَعْزَلُ and الرَّقِيبُ); [the former of which is, accord. to El-Kazweenee, the 14th Mansion, which, about the period above mentioned, set aurorally on the 4th of April: the latter seems to be the رقيب of الثريّا (see رقيب): i. e. الاـِكْلِيلُ, the 17th Mansion, which, about the same period, set aurorally on the 13th of May; a period of about forty days. Then comes الحَميمُ. [see this word, said by some to be] a period of about twenty nights, commencing at the [auroral] rising of الدَّبَرَان, [at the epoch of the Flight about the 26th of May, O. S.,] which has [little rain, or none, and is therefore said to have] ?? نوء. Then comes الخَريفُ [a period of little rain the انواء of which are النَّسْرَانِ [or the two vultures, النَّسْرُ الوَاقِعُ and النَّسْرُ الطَّايِرُ, which, in central Arabia, about the period above mentioned, set aurorally on the 24th of July, O. S., both together]: then, الخضر, [which I have not been able to identify with any known star or asterism, in the TT with صح written above it, to denote its being correctly transcribed]: then, العَرْقُوَتَانِ <br>\
                  الاُولَيانِ, the same says AM, as الفَرْغُ المُقَدَّمُ, the 26th Mansion, which, about the same period, set on the 8th of Sept.].
