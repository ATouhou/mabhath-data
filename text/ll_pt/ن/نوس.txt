                   is applied to <i>Men,</i> and to <i>jinn,</i> or <i>genii;</i> <br>\
                   (S, Msb, K;) but its predominant application is to the former: (Msb:) it is said by some to be applied to both in the former of the last two verses of the Kur, اْلَّذِى يُوَسْوِسُ فِى صُدُورِ النَّاسِ <br>\
                  مِنَ الجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ [<i>who suggesteth what is vain in the breasts of people of the jinn and mankind</i>]; unless by it be meant النَّاسِى [the forgetting]; or من الجنّة والناس is added in explanation of a preceding word, الوَسْوَاس, or of الذى, or it is in dependence upon يوسوس; (Bd;) [but what corroborates the first explanation is the fact that] men and jinn are both termed رِجَال in the Kur, lxxii. 6; and the Arabs used to say, رَاَيْتُ نَاسًا <br>\
                  مِنَ الجِنِّ [<i>I saw people of the jinn</i>]: (Msb:) it is a pl. of اـِنْسٌ, (K,) originally اُنَاسٌ, (S, K,) a pl. which is rare [as to form]; (K;) or اُنَاسٌ is pl. of اـِنْسَانٌ; (M, art. انس;) and ناس has the article ال prefixed to it, (S, M,) but not as a substitute for the suppressed ء, because, were it so, it would not be found prefixed to the original, اُنَاسٌ, whereas it is found prefixed to this latter: (S:) this derivation, however, from اُنَاسٌ, contradicts its belonging to art. نوس: (MF;) [but some hold that it does belong to this art.; and the form of its dim., to be mentioned below, favours their opinion: Fei says,] it is a noun applied to denote a pl., like قَوْمٌ and رَهْطٌ; and its sing. is اـِنْسَانٌ, from a different root: it is derived from نَاسَ, aor. يَنُوسُ, signifying “ it hung down and was in a state of commotion: ” and [agreeably with this derivation it is said that] its dim. is نُوَيْسٌ: (Msb:) some, again, said that النَّاسُ is originally النَّاسِى.
