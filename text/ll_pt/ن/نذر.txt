                  , (S, Msb,) inf. n. نَذْرٌ, (Msb,) <i>I made it binding,</i> or <i>obligatory, on myself,</i> [i. e., <i>I vowed,</i>] <i>of my own free will, to do</i> or <i>to give such a thing to God;</i> namely, some religious service, or an alms, &amp;amp;c.: (TA:) or نَذْرٌ signifies the <i>promising conditionally; as when one says,</i> “ <i>Such a thing shall be obligatory on me if God restore to health my sick</i> [<i>son</i> or <i>other</i>]: ” this is termed نَذْرٌ: but the saying “ I impose upon myself the giving a deenár as alms, ” is not so termed. (K.) The doing this is repeatedly forbidden in traditions: but what is meant thereby is, one&#39;s doing so in the belief that he may attain by it something which God has not decreed to betide him, or that he may divert from himself something decreed to befall him: yet if he do so, fulfilment is obligatory on him. (IAth.) You say also, نَذَرَ الوَلَدَ, (M, K,) and نَذَرَتْهُ, (M,) <i>He</i> (the father, M, K) and <i>she</i> (the mother, M) <i>appointed the child</i> [<i>by a vow</i>] <i>to be a minister</i> or <i>servant to the church,</i> (M, K,) or <i>to a place appropriated to religious services</i> or <i>exercises,</i> or <i>acts of devotion:</i> (TA:) so in the Kur, iii. 31. (M.)       -A2-  نَذِرَ بِالشَّىْءِ, aor.      <br>\
                     نَذَرَ<br>\

You say also نَذِرَ القَوْمُ بالعَدُوِّ (S, A) <i>The people knew of the enemy:</i> (S:) or <i>knew of the enemy and prepared themselves for them:</i> (A:) or <i>knew of the enemy and were cautious of them</i> or <i>on their guard against them</i> or <i>in fear of them.</i> (TA.) And it is said in a trad., اـِنْذَرِ القَوْمَ <br>\

                  <i>I informed him,</i> or <i>advised him, of such a thing.</i> (Msb.) انذرهُ also signifies <i>He</i> (a spy) <i>informed him,</i> or <i>advised him, of the state of the enemy:</i> in the copies of the K, نَذَرَهُ; but this is a mistake. (TA.) And you say, اَنْذَرْتُ القَوْمَ مَسِيرَ العَدُرِّ <br>\
                  اـِلَيْهِمْ <br>\
                  <i>I informed the people of the march of the enemy towards them, to put them on their guard.</i> (T.) And اَنْذَرْتُ القَوْمَ بِالعَدُوِّ, and اَنْذَرْتُهُمُ العَدُوَّ, signify the same. (A.) It is said in a proverb, قَدْ اَعْذَرَ مَنْ اَنْذَرَ, meaning, <i>He hath become excused,</i> and averted from himself the blame of men, <i>who hath warned</i> thee that he will punish thee for a future evil deed proceeding from thee, if thou then do the evil deed and he punish thee.

And اَعْطَيْتُهُ نَذْرَ جُرْحِهِ (tropical:)  <i>I gave him the mulct for his wound.</i> (A.) Aboo-Sa&#39;eed Ed-Dareer says that it is thus called لِاَنَّهُ نُذِرَ فِيهِ, i. e., because it is made binding, or obligatory, for it; [namely, for the wound;] from the phrase نَذَرْتُ علَى نَفْسِى.
