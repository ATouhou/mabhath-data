In a prayer of David occur the words يَا رَازِق النَّعَّابِ فِى عُشِّهِ [<i>O Sustainer of the young raven</i> (or <i>young crow</i>) <i>in his nest!</i>]. It is said that the young raven (or young crow), when it comes forth from its egg, is white, like a lump of fat, and that the old bird, on seeing it, dislikes and abandons it; that thereupon God sends to it gnats, which light upon it on account of its foul greasy smell, and that it lives upon them until it is fledged and becomes black, when its parents return to it.
