                  <i>He rose;</i> or <i>became raised,</i> or <i>lifted up:</i> (TA:) <i>he rose after his stumble,</i> or <i>trip:</i> (S, A, Msb, K:) and in like manner you say of a bird, (A, TA,) meaning <i>it rose</i> [<i>after falling</i> or <i>alighting</i>], (TA,) and <i>he raised his head.</i> (TA.) Hence the saying, تَعَسَ فَلا اْنْتَعَشَ <br>\
                  <i>May he fall, having stumbled,</i> or <i>stumble and fall, and not rise</i> [<i>again</i>]: a form of imprecation. (TA.) And hence the saying of &#39;Omar, اِنْتَعِشْ نَعَشَكَ اْللّٰهُ <br>\
                  <i>Rise thou: may God raise thee:</i> or نعشك اللّٰه has here one of the two meanings assigned to it before, in 1. (TA.) ―         -b2-  [And hence,] (tropical:)  <i>He recovered,</i> or <i>became recovered, from his embarrassment,</i> or <i>difficulty.</i> (A, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  <i>A state of elevation,</i> or <i>exaltation.</i> (Sh.) See 1. ―         -b2-  <i>A state of remaining; lastingness; endurance; permanence;</i> or <i>continuance;</i> syn. بَقَا=ءٌ. (Sh, K.)       -A2-  [<i>A kind of litter,</i> or] <i>a thing resembling a</i> <br>\
                  مِحَفَّة, upon which the <i>king used to be carried. when sick:</i> (IDrd, Msb, K:) not the نَعْش of a corpse. (IDrd, Msb.) This is said to be the primary application. (TA) ―         -b2-  And hence, (TA,) <i>A bier,</i> (S, A, Msb, K,) <i>when the corpse is upon it.</i> for otherwise it is called سرِيرٌ: (S, IAth, Msb:) it is called by the former name because of its height, or its being raised: (S, TA.) pl. نُعُوشٌ: (Msb:) also, <i>a reticulated thing.</i> (Az. Mgh, TA,) <i>resembling a</i> <br>\
                  محَفّة, (Mgh,) <i>which is put as a cover over a</i> [<i>dead</i>] <i>woman when she is placed upon the bier;</i> (Az, Mgh, TA;) but this is properly called حَرَجٌ, though people called is نَعْشٌ, which is properly only the bier itself. (Az, TA.) ―         -b3-  [And hence,] بَنَاتُ نَعْشِ الكُبْرَى [or بَنَاتُ <br>\
                  نَعْشَ الكُبْرَى, together with نَعْشٌ <br>\
                  <i>or</i> <br>\
                  نَعْشُ, constitute (assumed tropical:)  <i>The constellation of Ursa Major:</i> or <i>the principal stars thereof:</i>] <i>seven stars; whereof four</i> [<i>which are in the body</i>] <i>are called</i> <br>\
                  نَعْشٌ [or نَعْشُ], <i>and three</i> [<i>which are in the tail</i>] <i>are called</i> <br>\
                  بَناتٌ, (S, K,) i. e., بنات نعش (TA:) and <i>to</i> like manner الصُّغْرَى, (K,) or بنات نعش الصُّغْرَى [together with نعش الصُّغْرَى constitute [<i>the constellation of Ursa Minor:</i> or <i>the principal stars thereof; seven in number; whereof the four in the body are called</i> <br>\
                  نعش, <i>and the there in the tail are called</i> <br>\
                  بنات]: (S:) [the former four] said to be likened to the bearers of a bier, because they form a square: (IDrd, TA:) [the بنات being so called as being likened to damsels or to men for بنات is pl. of اِبْنٌ applied to an irrational thing as well as pl. of بِنْتٌ) following a bier:] Sb and Fr agree that نعش is imperfectly decl. because determinate and of the fem. gender: (S:) or it is perfectly decl. when indeterminate, but not when determinate [by having the epithet الكُبْرَى or الصُّغْرَى added to it]: (Aboo-&#39;Amr Ez-Záhid, K:) بَنو نَعْشِ also occurs, in poetry; (Sb, S, K;) because a single one [of the stars thereof] is called ابْنُ نَعْشِ, (Lth, K,) being made to accord. in gender with كَوْكَبٌ; but when they say ثَلَاث or اَرْبَع, they say بَنَات: (Lth, TA:) [this is agreeable with a general rule; accord. to which, بَنَاتٌ is the pl. of اِبْنٌ applied to anything but a human being:] the pl. of بنات نعش is النَّوَاعِشُ; like as اَبَارِصُ is pl. of سَامُّ اَبَرَصَ. (L, TA.) See also نُعَيْشٌ. ―         -b4-  Also نَعْشٌ <br>\
                  <i>A piece of wood,</i> (K, TA,) <i>of the length of twice the stature of a man,</i> (TA,) <i>upon the head of which is a piece of rag,</i> (K, TA,) <i>called</i> <br>\
