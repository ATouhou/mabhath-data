It is said that the action is peculiarly that of women; and that the verb is derived from نَدَبَهُ, “ he called him ” to do a thing; or from نَدَبٌ, “ a scar, ” because the wailer mentions the memorials of him who has gone; or perhaps from نَدْبٌ, “ lightness, or activity. ” (MF.)       -A2-  نَدِبَ, aor.      <br>\

      نَدْبٌ, (MF,) The <i>scar,</i> (S,) or <i>scars,</i> (K,) <i>of a wound,</i> (S, K,) <i>not rising above the surrounding skin:</i> (S:) accord. to the K, pl. نَدَبَةٌ [which is written in several MS. copies of the K نَدْبَةٌ; and so in the CK; but this, accord. to the TA, is incorrect;] but it is a coll. gen. n., of which the n. un. is نَدَبَةٌ, like as شَجَرَةٌ is that of شَجَرٌ: (MF:) pl. اَنْدَابٌ and نُدُوبٌ: (K:) the former of نَدَبٌ agreeably with analogy: the latter dev. with respect to analogy; or pl. of نَدْبٌ. (MF.) ―         -b2-  نَدَبٌ is also applied, in a trad., to the (tropical:)  <i>Marks</i> made by Moses&#39; smiting the stone [from which, thereupon, water flowed forth]; these marks being thus likened to the scars of wounds. (TA.) ―         -b3-  نَدَبٌ is also employed to signify (tropical:)  <i>Scars</i> upon men&#39;s reputation. A poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        قَوْمٌ سَاَتْرُكُ فِى اَعْرَاضِهِمْ نَدَبَا<br>\
                  <i>A people upon whose reputation I will leave scars,</i> the effects of my satires. (TA.)       -A2-  نَدَبٌ The <i>direction in which one shoots an arrow</i> or <i>arrows:</i> syn. رِشْقٌ. (So in the S and the CK and several MS. copies of the K: in other copies, رَشْقٌ The <i>act of shooting an arrow</i> or <i>arrows.</i> Both these readings are correct accord. to the TA. See below.) اـِرْتَمَى نَدَبًا اَوْ نَدَبَيْنِ <br>\
                  <i>He shot an arrow</i> or <i>arrows in one direction</i> or <i>in two directions:</i> syn. وَجْهًا اَوْ وَجْهَيْنِ. (TA.) ―         -b2-  نَدَبُنَا يَوْمَ كَذَا (said by those who are to contend at a shooting-match, TA,) <i>The day of our commencing shooting shall be such a day.</i> (K.) This confirms the assertion in the TA, that نَدَبٌ is syn. with رَشْقٌ, as well as with رِشْقٌ. In the Turk. K, in the place of يَوْمَ اْبْتِدَايِنَا, we find يوم اْنْتِدَابِنَا; and Freytag adopts the latter reading; but I find no other authority for it.] ―         -b3-  نَدَبٌ <br>\
                  <i>A bet, wager, stake,</i> or <i>thing wagered; what is staked at a shooting match,</i> or <i>a race, and taken by the winner:</i> (S, * K, * L:) pl. اَنْدَابٌ. (Msb.) So in the following phrases. ―         -b4-  بَيْنَهُمْ <br>\
                  نَدَبٌ [<i>Between them is a bet,</i> or <i>wager</i>]. ―         -b5-  اَقَامَ <br>\
                  فُلَانٌ عَلَى نَدَبٍ [<i>Such a one stood to a bet, wager,</i> or <i>stake</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b6-  &#39;Orweh says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
