      استنثر signifies <i>he snuffed up water, and put in motion the</i> <br>\
                  نَثْرَة, or <i>end of the nose,</i> in purification: (T [in the Mgh, this explanation is ascribed to Fr:]) and Fr, that نَثَرَ and ↓ <br>\

      اَنْثَرَ, from الاـِنْثَارُ; one only says, نَثَرَ and ↓ <br>\
      انتثر and ↓ <br>\
      استنثر. (T.) No instance of ↓ <br>\

      اِسْتَنْثَرَ [<i>He ejected the contents of his nose;</i> or <i>he blew his nose</i>]; as though the root [نَثَرَ] were regarded in it, or as though it were made to import the meaning of نَقَّى. (Mgh.)    </entryFree> <br>\
