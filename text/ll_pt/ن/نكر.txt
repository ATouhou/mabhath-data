      استنكرهُ; (S, M, A, K;) and ↓ <br>\
      تناكرهُ; (M, K;) signify the same; (S, A, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.;) i. e., <i>He ignored, was ignorant of, did not know, failed to know,</i> or [rather] <i>was unacquainted with, it</i> (i. e. a thing, or an affair, IKtt, K) or <i>him</i> (a man, S); syn. جَهِلَهُ; (Kr, K;) or <i>contr. of</i> <br>\
                  عَرَفَهُ: (S, * IKtt, Msb:) [see also نَكَارَةٌ:] some, however, say, the نَكِرَ has a more intensive signification than اَنْكَرَ: and some, that نَكِرَ has for its objective complement an object of the mind; and اَنْكَرَ, an object of the sight: (A, TA:) or [the converse is the case;] نَكِرَ has for its objective complement an object of the sight; and اَنْكَرَ, an object of the mind: (Kull, p. 81:) [but both forms seem to have been generally used indiscriminately.] ElAashà says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> [<i>And she did not know me; and the accidents which she did not know were none others than hoariness, and baldness of the fore part of the head</i>]. (S, TA.) And it is said in the Kur, [xi. 73,] وَاَوْجَسَ مِنْهُمْ خِيفَةٌ ↓ <br>\
      نَكِرَهُمْ [<i>He knew not what they were, and conceived a fear,</i> or <i>a kind of fear, of them</i>]: (TA:) نَكِرَهُمْ here signifies اَنْكَرَهُمْ: (Jel:) or it means اَنْكَرَ ذٰلِكَ مِنْهُمْ [q. v. infra]. (Bd.) ―         -b2-  اَنْكَرَهُ also signifies <i>He denied,</i> or <i>disacknowledged, it;</i> (L, art. جحد; [and this signification, as well as the first, may be meant to be indicated by those who say that اَنْكَرَهُ signifies the contr. of عَرفَهُ;]) [and so ↓ <br>\
      نَكِرَهُ; for] اـِنْكَارٌ signifies <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  جُحُودٌ, (S, TA,) and so نُكْرَانٌ [which is an inf. n. of نَكِرَهُ]. (TA.) [In this sense it is doubly trans.:] you say, اَنْكَرْتُهُ <br>\
                  حَقَّهُ, meaning, <i>I denied,</i> or <i>disacknowledged, to him his right.</i> (Msb.) The cause of اـِنْكَار with the tongue is اـِنْكَار with the mind, but sometimes the tongue denies, or disacknowledges, (يُنْكِرُ,) a thing when the image thereof is present in the mind; and this is lying; as is the case in the following passage of the Kur, [xvi. 85,] يَعْرِفُونَ <br>\
                  نِعْمَةَ اْللّٰهِ ثُمَّ يُنْكِرُونَهَا [<i>They confess,</i> or <i>acknowledge, the favour of God; then they deny,</i> or <i>disacknowledge, it</i>]. (B.)

      نَكِرَ and اَنْكَرَ and ↓ <br>\
      استنكر [of which last see an ex. voce تَهِمَ] signify the same. (Bd, xi. 73.) And you say, اَنْكَرْتُ عَلَيْهِ فِعْلَهُ, meaning, <i>I blamed,</i> or <i>found fault with, his deed, and forbade it; I disapproved and disallowed his deed.</i> (Msb:) [and <i>I manifested,</i> or <i>showed,</i> or <i>declared, disapproval,</i> or <i>disallowance, of his</i> <br>\
                  <i>deed:</i> and in like manner, اَنْكَرْتُ عَليْهِ, elliptically; فِعْلَهُ, (his deed,) or قَوْلَهُ, (his saying;) or the like, being understood; like عَيَّرَ عَلَيْهِ for عَيَّرَ عَلَيْهِ فِعْلَهُ or the like: see نَكِيرٌ.] ―         -b5-  اـِنْكَارٌ also signifies The <i>changing</i> [a thing; like تَنْكِيرٌ]: (T, Msb, TA:) or the <i>changing what is</i><br>\
                  مُنْكَر [here app. meaning <i>disapproved:</i> see نَكِيرٌ, which is syn. with it, but is a simple subst.]. (S, TA.) ―         -b6-  مَا اَنْكَرَهُ <br>\
                  <i>How great it his cunning!</i> meaning both <i>his intelligence, and craft, and forecast;</i> and simply, <i>his intelligence,</i> or <i>skill and knowledge.</i> (TA.) And مَا كَانَ اَنْكَرَهُ <br>\
