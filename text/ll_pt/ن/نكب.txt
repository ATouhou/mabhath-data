                  الاَزْيَبُ; (S, K;) which is a very thirsty wind, that dries up much the leguminous plants; but Et-Tará- bulusee, in the Kf, and Mbr and IF, assert that the ازيب is the جنوب; not its نكباء: (TA:) second, the نكباءُ الصَّبَا وَالشَّمَالِ <br>\
                  <i>the wind that blows in a direction between that of the east,</i> or <i>easterly, and that of the north,</i> or <i>northerly, wind;</i> also called الصَّابَيةُ, and called also ↓ <br>\

                  نكباء [by which he means only the wind that blows from the north-east or thereabout] <i>is that extending between the point where rises the</i> <br>\

                  شمال; [<i>blowing from the north-east,</i> or <i>thereabout;</i>] and it resembles it in gentleness; sometimes having sharpness, or vehemence; but this is seldom; only once in a long space of time: that of the شمال is <i>that which is between it and the</i> <br>\
                  دبور; [<i>blowing from the north-west,</i> or <i>thereabout;</i>] and it resembles it in coldness: it is called الشمالُ <br>\
                  الشَّامِيَّةُ: each of them is called by the Arabs شاميّة: that of the دبور is <i>that which is between it and the</i> <br>\
                  جنوب; <i>blowing from the point where sets</i> <br>\
                  سُهَيْل [or <i>Canopus; i. e., S.</i> 29 degrees <i>W., in the latitude of central Arabia</i>]; and it resembles it in its violence and boisterousness: and that of the جنوب <br>\

                  صبا; [<i>blowing from the south-east,</i> or <i>thereabout;</i>] and it is the wind most resembling it in its softness and in its gentleness in winter. (L.)
