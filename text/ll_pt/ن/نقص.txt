Ramadán and Dhu-l-Hijjeh, (Mgh,) meaning, <i>Two months of festival are not defective</i> virtually (فِى الحُكْمِ) though they be defective in number [of days]; (K;) i. e. let no doubt occur in your hearts when ye fast nine and twenty days [instead of thirty]; nor if there happen a mistake respecting the day of the pilgrimage, will there be any deficiency in your performance of the rites thereof: (TA:) or, as some say, <i>two months of festival will not be defective</i> in one and the same year; but Et- Taháwee disapproves of this explanation: some say that the meaning is, that though they be defective, or one of them be so, yet their recompense will be complete. (Mgh.) It is also said in a trad., اـِنَّ العَمَلَ فِى عَشْرِ ذِى الحِجَّةِ لَا يَنْقُصُ <br>\
                  ثَوَابُهُ عَمَّا فِى شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ [<i>Verily the deed</i> that is done <i>on the tenth of Dhu-l-Hijjeh, the recompense thereof will not fall short of that which is in the month of Ramadán:</i> for نَقَصَ عَنْ كَذَا means <i>It fell short of such a thing.</i>] (Mgh.)

                  , (Msb,) inf. n. نَقْصٌ, (MS,) [and accord. to the TK تَنْقَاصٌ and نُقْصَانٌ also, which last, however, is said in the MS to be an inf. n. of the intrans. verb only,] <i>He made it to lose somewhat, decreased it, diminished it, curtailed it, lessened it, wasted it, impaired it, took from it,</i> or <i>made it defective</i> or <i>deficient</i> or <i>incomplete</i> or <i>imperfect, after it had been whole</i> or <i>complete</i> or <i>perfect;</i> (Msb;) <i>he made it</i> (i. e. a share, or portion) <i>defective</i> or <i>deficient:</i> (K:) [the pronoun often relates to a man: see an ex. in art. ضوز, and another in art. وكس:] this is the [most] chaste form of the verb, and is that which occurs in the Kur.: (Msb:) ↓ <br>\
      انقصهُ also signifies the same; (M, Msb, K;) and so does ↓ <br>\
      نقّصهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. تَنْقِيصٌ: (TA:) but these two are of weak authority, and do not occur in chaste language: (Msb:) and ↓ <br>\
      انتقصهُ signifies the same: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) or this last signifies <i>he took from it by little and little;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      تنقّصهُ. (M, * TA [in the latter of which this is plainly said of both of the last two verbs; but in the M, it seems rather to be said of تنقّصه only.]) [See an ex. of the verb followed by من voce طَرَفٌ. You say also, نَقَصَ مِنْهُ كَذَا <br>\

                  اَوْفَاهُ: (TA:) [and <i>he abridged him, deprived him,</i> or <i>defrauded him, of it altogether;</i> for نَقَصَهُ اَهْلَهُ وَمَالَهُ signifies sometimes <i>He deprived him of his family and his property altogether:</i> as appears from the following ex.:] نُقِصَ اَهْلَهُ وَمَالَهُ وَبَقِىَ فَرْدًا [<i>He was deprived of his family and his property, and remained alone</i>].

      مَنْقَصَةٌ signifies the same as نَقْص] as here rendered, agreeably with the explanation (i. e. of منقصة) in the PS., which is كَمِىْ: or, accord. to the A, مَنْقَصَةٌ seems to be syn. with نَقِيصَةٌ in the sense assigned to this last in the S, or in certain senses assigned to it in the K, which see below; and thus to be more restricted in application than نَقْصٌ]. (S, TA.) ―         -b3-  <i>Weakness of intellect:</i> (M, TA:) and <i>weakness</i> with respect to religion and intellect. (TA.)

      نُقْصَانٌ [in this case]: (K:) app. because النَّقْص is “ weakness; ” whereas النُّقْصَانُ is only “ a going away [of part of a thing] after [its having been in] a state of completeness. ” (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

      مَنْقَصَةٌ, also, accord. to the A, seems to be syn. with نَقِيصَةٌ in one or another of the senses explained above; but its primary signification is probably <i>a cause of</i> <br>\
                  نَقْص, like as that of مَبْخَلَةٌ is a cause of بُخْل, and that of مَجْبَنَةٌ a cause of جُبْن: the pl. of نَقِيصَةٌ is نَقَايِصُ: and that of مَنْقَصَةٌ is مَنَاقِصُ.] You say, مَا فِيهِ نَقِيصَةٌ and ↓ <br>\
