Hence the saying in the Kur, [xlvii. 40,] فَاـِنَّمَا يَبْخَلُ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ [app. meaning <i>He is only avaricious from his avarice.</i>] (TA.) You say, نَفِسَ عَلَيْهِ بِالشَّىْءِ, (M,) or عَنْهُ [in the place of عليه], (TA,) <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, avaricious,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>of the thing, towards him,</i> or <i>withholding it from him.</i> (M, TA.)

[In the CK, a confusion is made by the omission of a و before the verb which explains this last signification.] This signification and that next preceding it are from نَفْسٌ meaning “ blood. ” (Mgh.)       -A4-  نَفَسْتُهُ بِنَفْسِ (tropical:)  <i>I smote him with an</i> [<i>evil</i> or <i>envious</i>] <i>eye.</i> (S, K, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                   [<i>He breathed</i>] is said of a man and of every animal having lungs: (S:) [or it signifies] <i>he drew</i> (اِسْتَمَدَّ) <i>breath:</i> (M:) or [<i>he respired,</i> i. e.] <i>he drew breath with the air-passages in his nose; to his inside, and emitted it.</i> (Msb.) You say also, تنفّس الصُّعَدَا=ءَ [<i>He sighed:</i> see also art. صعد]. (S.) ―         -b2-  (tropical:)  <i>He</i> (a man) <i>emitted wind from beneath him.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  Also, (TA,) or تنفّس <br>\
                  فِى الاـِنَا=ءِ, (K,) (tropical:)  <i>He drank</i> (K, TA) <i>from the vessel</i> (TA) <i>with three restings between draughts, and separated the vessel from his mouth at every such resting:</i> (K, TA.) and, contr., the latter phrase, (assumed tropical:)  <i>he drank</i> [<i>from the vessel</i>] <i>without separating it from his mouth:</i> (K, TA:) which latter mode of drinking is disapproved. (TA.) ―         -b4-  Also تنفّس (assumed tropical:)  <i>He lengthened in speech; he spoke long;</i> for when a speaker takes breath, it is easy  to him to lengthen his speech; and تنفس فِى <br>\
                  الكَلَامِ signifies the same. (TA.) ―         -b5-  (tropical:)  <i>It</i> (said of the day, M, A, and of the dawn, A, and of other things, M) <i>became extended;</i> (M;) <i>it became long;</i> (M, A;) or, said of the day, accord. to Lh, <i>it advanced so that it became noon:</i> (M:) or <i>it increased:</i> (S:) and <i>it extended far:</i> and hence it is said of life, meaning either <i>it became protracted, and extended far,</i> or <i>it became ample:</i> (M:) and, said of the dawn, <i>it shone forth,</i> (Akh, S, K, TA,) <i>and extended so that it became clear day:</i> (Fr, TA:) or <i>it broke, so that things became plain in consequence of it:</i> (TA:) or <i>it rose:</i> (Mujáhid:) or <i>its dusty hue shone at the approach of a gentle wind.</i> (Bd, lxxxi. 18.) You say also, تنفّس بِهِ العُمُرُ (tropical:)  [<i>Life became long,</i> or <i>protracted,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>with him</i>]. (A.) And تنفّست دِجْلَةُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>The water of the Tigris increased.</i> (TA.) ―         -b6-  تنفّس <br>\

It is only the stick that is not split in twain that does so; and this is the best of bows. And تنفّس in the same sense is said of an arrow.

                   The <i>soul;</i> the <i>spirit;</i> the <i>vital principle;</i> syn. رُوحٌ: (S, M, A, Msb, K:) but between these two words is a difference [which must be fully explained hereafter, though ISd says, that it is not of the purpose of his book, the M, to explain it]: (M:) in this sense it is fem.: (Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] اَنْفُسٌ and [of mult.] نُفُوسٌ. (M, Msb.) You say, خَرَجَتْ نَفْسُهُ [<i>His soul,</i> or <i>spirit, went forth</i>]; (Aboo-Is-hák, S, M, Msb, K;) and so جَادَتْ نَفْسُهُ. (Msb.) And a poet says, not Aboo-Khirásh as in the S, but Hudheyfeh Ibn-Anas, (IB,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  </quote> i. e., [<i>Sálim escaped when the soul was in the side of his mouth; but he escaped not save</i>] <i>with the scabbard of a sword and with a waist-wrapper.</i> (S.) In the same sense the word is used in the saying. فِى نَفْسِ فُلَانٍ اَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا وَكَذَا [but this seems rather to mean, <i>It is in the mind of such a one to do so and so</i>]. (Aboo-Is-hák, M.) Some of the lexicologists assert the نَفْس and the رُوح to be one and the same, except that the former is fem., and the latter [generally or often] masc.: others say, that the latter is that whereby is life; and the former, <i>that whereby is intellect,</i> or <i>reason;</i> so that when one sleeps, God takes away his نفس, but not his روح, which is not taken save at death: and the نَفْس is thus called because of its connexion with the نَفَس [or breath]. (IAmb.) Or every man has نَفْسَانِ [<i>two souls</i>]: (I&#39;Ab, Zj:) نَفْسُ <br>\
                  العَقْلِ [<i>the soul of intellect,</i> or <i>reason,</i> also called النَّفْسُ النَّاطِقَةُ (see رُوحٌ)], <i>whereby one discriminates,</i> [i. e., <i>the mind,</i>] (I&#39;Ab,) or نَفْسُ التَّمْيِيزِ [<i>the soul of discrimination</i>], which quits him when he sleeps, so that he does not understand thereby, God taking it away: (Zj:) and نَفْسُ <br>\
                  الرُّوحِ [<i>the soul of the breath</i>], <i>whereby one lives,</i> (I&#39;Ab,) or نَفْسُ الحَيَاةِ [<i>the soul of life</i>], and when this quits him, the breath quits with it; whereas the sleeper breathes: and this is the difference between the taking away of the نفس of the sleeper in sleep and the taking away of the نفس of the living [at death.] (Zj.) Much has been said respecting the نَفْس and the رُوح; whether they be one, or different: but the truth is, that there is a difference between them, since they are not always interchangeable: for it is said in the Kur, [xv. 29 and xxxviii. 72,] وَنَفَخْتُ فِيهِ مِنْ رُوحِى [And I have blown into him of my spirit.]; not مِنْ نَفْسِى: and [v. 116,] تَعْلَمُ مَا فِى نَفْسِى [to be explained hereafter]; not فِى رُوحِى, nor would this expression be well except from Jesus: and [lviii. 9,] وَيَقُولُونَ فِى <br>\
                  اَنْفُسِهِمْ [<i>And they say in their souls,</i> or <i>within themselves</i>]: for which it would not be well to say فِى اَرْوَاحِهِمْ: and [xxxix. 57,] اَنْ تَقُولَ نَفْسٌ [<i>That a soul shall say</i>]; for which no Arab would say اَنْ تَقُولَ رُوحٌ: hence, the difference between them depends upon the considerations of relation: and this is indicated by a trad., in which it is said that God created Adam, and put into him a نَفْس and a رُوح; and that from the latter was his quality of abstaining from unlawful and indecorous things, and his understanding, and his clemency, or forbearance, and his liberality, and his fidelity; and from the former, [which is also called النَّفْسُ الاَمَّارَةُ, q. v., in art. امر,] his appetence, and his unsteadiness, and his hastiness of disposition, and his anger: therefore one should not say that نَفْسٌ is the same as رُوحٌ absolutely, without restriction, nor رُوحٌ the same as نَفْس. (R.) The Arabs also make the discriminative نَفْس to be two; because it sometimes commands the man to do a thing or forbids him to do it; and this is on the occasion of setting about an affair that is disliked: therefore they make that which commands him to be a نفس, and that which forbids him to be as though it were another نفس: and hence the saying, mentioned by Z, فُلَانٌ يُوَامِرُ نَفْسَيْهِ (tropical:)  [<i>Such a one consults his two souls,</i> or <i>minds</i>]; said of a man when two opinions occur to him. (TA.) [بِنَفْسِى فُلَانٌ is an elliptical phrase sometimes used, for بِنَفْسِى فُلَانٌ مَفْدِىٌّ, which see in art. فدى.] ―         -b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A thing&#39;s <i>self;</i> (S, M, A, K, TA;) used as a corroborative; (S, TA;) its <i>whole,</i> (Aboo-Is-hák, M, TA,) and <i>essential constituent:</i> (Aboo-Is-hák, M, A, K, TA:) pl. as above, اَنْفُسٌ and نُفُوسٌ. (M.) You say, رَاَيْتُ فُلَانًا نَفْسَهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>I saw such a one himself,</i> (S,) and جَا=ءَنِى بِنَفْسِهِ [or, more properly, حَا=ءَنِى هُوَ بِنَفْسِهِ (see, under the head of بِ, a remark on that preposition when used in a case of this kind, redundantly,)] <i>He came to me himself.</i> (S, K.) And وَلِىَ <br>\
                  الاَمْرَ بِنَفْسِهِ [<i>He superintended, managed,</i> or <i>conducted, the affair in his own person</i>]. (K, in art. بشر, &amp;amp;c.) And حَدَّثَ نَفْسَهُ [<i>He talked to himself; soliloquized</i>]. (Msb, in art. بلو; &amp;amp;c.) And قَتَلَ فُلَانٌ نَفْسَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Such a one killed himself</i>]: and اَهْلَكَ نَفْسَهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>made his whole self to fall into destruction.</i> (Aboo-Is-hák, M.) And hence, (TA,) from نَفْسُ الشَّىْءِ signifying ذَاتُهُ, (M,) the saying mentioned by Sb, نَزَلْتُ بِنَفْسِ الجَبَلِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>I alighted in the mountain itself</i>]: and نَفْسُ <br>\
                  الجَبَلِ مُقَابِلِى (assumed tropical:)  [<i>The mountain itself is facing me</i>]. (M, TA.) [Hence also the phrase] فِى <br>\
                  نَفْسِ الاَمْرِ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>in reality; in the thing itself</i>]: as in the saying, قَلَّلَهُ فِى نَفْسِهِ وَاـِنْ لَمْ <br>\
                  يَكُنْ قَلِيلًا فِى نَفْسِ الاَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He held it to be little in his mind though it was not little in reality</i>]. (Msb, art. قل.) The words of the Kur, [v. 116,] تَعْلَمُ مَا فِى نَفْسِى وَلَا اَعْلَمُ مَا فِى نَفْسِكَ mean (assumed tropical:)  <i>Thou knowest what is in myself,</i> or <i>in my essence, and I know not what is in thyself,</i> or <i>in thine essence:</i> (Bd, K:) or <i>Thou knowest what I conceal</i> (M, Bd, Jel) <i>in my</i> <br>\
                  نفس [or <i>mind</i>], (Bd, Jel,) <i>and I know not what is in thyself,</i> or <i>in thine essence, nor that whereof Thou hast the knowledge,</i> (M.) or <i>what Thou concealest of the things which Thou knowest;</i> (Bd, Jel;) so that the interpretation is, <i>Thou knowest what I know, and I know not what Thou knowest:</i> (M:) or نفس is here syn. with عِنْد; and the meaning is, تَعْلَمُ مَا عِنْدِى وَلَا اَعْلَمُ مَا عِنْدَكَ; (K, * TA;) [i. e., <i>Thou knowest what is in my particular place of being, and I know not what is in thy particular place of being;</i> for] the adverbiality in this instance is that of مَكَانَة, not of مَكَان: (TA:) but the best explanation is that of IAmb, who says that نفس is here syn. with غَيْب; so that the meaning is, <i>Thou knowest</i> <br>\
                  غَيْبِى [<i>my hidden things,</i> or <i>what is hidden from me, and I know not thy hidden things,</i> or <i>what Thou hidest</i>]; and the correctness of this is testified by the concluding words of the verse, اـِنَّكَ اَنْتَ عَلَّامُ الغُيُوبِ [for Thou art he who well knoweth the hidden things]: (TA:) [and here it must be remarked that] العَيْبُ, which occurs afterwards in the K as one of the significations of النَّفْسُ, is a mistake for الغَيْبُ, the word used by IAmb in explaining the above verse.
