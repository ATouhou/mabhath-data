                  <i>and made a</i> [<i>smacking</i>] <i>sound</i> [<i>by suddenly withdrawing his tongue</i>]: (A:) نَقْرٌ signifies the <i>making the end of the tongue to adhere to the palate, then making a sound</i> [<i>by suddenly withdrawing it</i>]: (M, K:) or one&#39;s <i>putting his tongue above his central incisors, at the part next the palate, then making a smacking sound</i> [so I render ثُمَّ يَنْقُر]: (TA:) [the sounds thus described, which are nearly the same, are commonly made by the Arabs in the present day, in urging beasts of carriage:] or <i>an agitation of the tongue</i> (K, TA) <i>in the mouth, upwards and downwards:</i> (TA:) or <i>a sound,</i> (so in some copies of the K and in the TA,) or <i>slight sound,</i> (so in the TS [as mentioned in the TA] and in some copies of the K) <i>by which a horse is put in motion:</i> (TS, K:) or نَقَرَ بِلِسَانِهِ, accord. to IKtt, signifies <i>he struck his palate with his tongue</i> to quiet the horse: but this is at variance with what is said by Az, J, and ISd, and requires consideration. (TA.) A poet, (S,) Fedekee El-Minkaree, (K,) i. e., &#39;Obeyd  Ibn-Máweeyeh, of the tribe of Teiyi, (TA,) uses النَّقُرْ for النَّقْرْ, meaning النَّقْرُ بِاْلْخَيْلِ [<i>The smacking with the tongue to urge the horses</i>]: pausing after the word, at the end of a hemistich, he transfers the vowel of the ر to the ق, (S, K,) agreeably with the dial. of certain of the Arabs, (TA,) that the hearer may know it to be the vowel of the [final] letter when there is no pause; (S;) like as you say, هٰذَا بَكْرُ and مَرَرْتُ بِبَكِرْ: but this is not done when the word is in the accus. case (S, K:) and if you choose, you may make the final letter quiescent in pausing, though it is preceded by a quiescent letter. (S.) ―         -b9-  Hence also, فَاـِذَا نُقِرَ فِى النَّاقُورِ [Kur, lxxiv. 8,] (tropical:)  <i>For when the horn shall be blown:</i> (S, * A, * Bd, K:) from نَقْرٌ signifying (tropical:)  the <i>making a sound:</i> originally, <i>striking,</i> which is the cause of sound.

                  مِنْقَار: (S:) and, inf. n. نَقْرٌ, <i>he hollowed out,</i> or <i>excavated,</i> a piece of wood. (Mgh, Msb.) نُقِرٌ and ↓ <br>\

(A, Msb.) ―         -b3-  [Hence,] اَخْطَاَتْ نَوَاقِرُهُ (tropical:)  [lit., <i>His arrows that were wont to hit the butt missed</i>]; meaning, <i>he did not continue in the right course.</i> (TA.) [And hence,] نَاقِرَةٌ (tropical:)  <i>A calamity;</i> (K, TA;) pl. نَوَاقِرُ. (TA.)

(TA.) One says, اَتَتْنِى عَنْهُ نَوَاقِرُ (tropical:)  <i>There came to me, from him, speech which displeased me,</i> or <i>grieved me:</i> or <i>right arguments,</i> or <i>the like,</i> (K, TA,) <i>like arrows hitting the mark.</i> (TA.)
