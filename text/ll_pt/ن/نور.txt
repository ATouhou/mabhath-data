[of pauc.] اَنْوُرٌ, (S, M, L,) in the K اَنْوَارٌ, [which is a mistake, though this is also said to be a pl. of نار,] (TA,) and [of mult.] نِيرَانٌ [which is the most common form] (S, M, K) and نُورٌ (AAF, S, M, Msb, K) and نِيَرَةٌ and نِيَارٌ, (M, K,) and اَنْيَارٌ also occurs, in the phrase نَارُ الاَنْيَارِ, in a trad. respecting the prison of hell; this phrase, if correctly related, perhaps meaning نَارُ النِّيِرَانِ, and انيار being originally اَنْوَار. (IAth.) النَّارُ is also applied to <i>The fire of hell.</i> (TA:) The Arabs say, in cursing their enemies, اَبْعَدَ اْللّٰهُ دَارَهُمْ وَاَوْقَدَ <br>\
                  نَارًا اَثَرَهُمْ [<i>May God make their abode distant, and kindle a fire after them!</i>] And it was a custom of Arab women, as related by IAar, on the authority of El-&#39;Okeyleeyeh, when they feared evil from a man, and he removed from them, to kindle a fire behind him, with the view of causing his evil to depart with him. (T.) ―         -b2-  نَارُ اْلْمُهَوِّلِ <br>\
                  <i>A fire which the Arabs used to kindle, in the time of ignorance, on the occasion of entering into a confederacy: they threw into it some salt, which crackled</i> (يُفَقِّعُ) <i>when the fire burned it: with this they frightened</i> [<i>one another</i>] <i>in confirmation of the swearing.</i> (T.) ―         -b3-  نَارُ الحُبَاحِبِ has been explained in art. حب. ―         -b4-  نَارٌ also signifies simply <i>Heat.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  Also, (tropical:)  [The <i>fire,</i> meaning] the <i>evil, and excitement,</i> or <i>rage,</i> or war; as also ↓ <br>\
      نَايِرَةٌ. (TA.) You say, اَوْقَدَ نَارَ الحَرْبِ (tropical:)  [<i>He kindled the fire of war</i>]. (A.) ―         -b6-  Also, (tropical:)  <i>Opinion; counsel; advice.</i> (IAar, T, K.) So in the trad., لَا تَسْتَضِيوُوا بِنَارِ <br>\

      نُورٌ: (TA:) pl. as above: (M:) or the pl. is نِيَارٌ, and the pl. of the نار that burns is نِيرَانٌ. (IAar, Th, T.) The Arabs say, مَا نَارُ هٰذِهِ النَّاقَةِ (tropical:)  <i>What is the brand,</i> or <i>mark, of this she-camel, with which she is burned?</i> (T, S, A. *) And they say, in a proverb, بِجَارُهَا نَارُهَا (T, S) <i>Their origin is indicated by their mark with which they are burned.</i> (T.)

      نَوْرَانيَّةٌ signifies the same as نُورٌ. (TA.) As نور is a convenience of the pious in the present world and the world to come, it is said in the Kur, [lvii. 13,] اُنْظُرُونَا نَقْتَبِسْ مِنْ نُورِكُمْ [<i>Wait ye for us that we may take of your light</i>]. (B.) [See also ظُلَمْةٌ.] ―         -b2-  It is also applied to <i>Mohammad:</i> (T, M, K:) it is said by Aboo-Is-hak to be so applied in the Kur, v. 18. (T.) ―         -b3-  And That <i>which manifests things,</i> (K, TA,) <i>and shows to the eyes their true</i> or <i>real state:</i> and therefore النُّور is applied in the Kur, vii. 156, to (tropical:)  <i>that</i> [<i>revelation</i>] <i>which the Prophet brought.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  النُّورُ is also one of the names of God; meaning, accord. to IAth, <i>He by whose light the obscure in perception sees, and by whose guidance the erring is directed aright:</i> or <i>the Manifest, by whom is every manifestation.</i> And اَللّٰهُ نُورُ السَّمٰوَاتِ وَاْلْاَرْضِ [in the Kur, xxiv. 35,] means <i>God is the enlightener of the heavens and of the earth:</i> like as فُلَانٌ غِيَاثُنَا means مُغِيثُنَا: (TA:) or, as some say, <i>the right director of the inhabitants of the heavens and of the inhabitants of the earth.</i> (T.) ―         -b5-  See also نَارٌ, last signification.     <br>\
