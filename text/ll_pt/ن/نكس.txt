      نكّسهُ, (S, A, K) inf. n. تَنْكِيسٌ, (S,) signifies the same; (S, * A, K;) or has an intensive sense. (TA.) You say, نُكِسَ السَّهْمُ فِى الكِنَانَةِ <br>\
                  <i>The arrow was turned,</i> or <i>put, upside down in the quiver.</i> (TA.) And it is said in the Kur, [xxxvi. 68,] وَمَنْ نُعَمِّرْهُ نَنْكُسْهُ فِى الخَلْقِ, or, accord. to the reading of &#39;Ásim and Hamzeh, ↓ <br>\
      نُنَكِّسْهُ; meaning, <i>And him whom We cause to live long, We cause him to become in a state the reverse of that in which he was, in constitution; so that after strength, he becomes reduced to weakness; and after youthfulness, to extreme old age.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  نَكَسْتُ فُلَانًا فِى ذٰلِكَ الاَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>I made such a one to enter again into that affair,</i> or <i>state, after he had got out of it.</i> (ISh.) [Hence the saying in the Kur, xxi. 66,] ثُمَّ <br>\
                  نُكِسُوا عَلَى رُوُوسِهِمْ (assumed tropical:)  <i>Then they were made to return to their disbelief:</i> (Jel:) or (tropical:)  <i>then they reverted to disputation, after they had taken the right course by means of consulting together;</i> their return to falsity being likened to a thing&#39;s becoming upside down: and there are two other readings; ↓ <br>\
      نُكِّسُوا, and نَكَسُوا; the latter meaning نَكَسُوا اَنْفُسَهُمْ: (Bd;) or (assumed tropical:)  <i>then they reverted from what they knew,</i> of the evidence in favour of Abraham. (Fr.) ―         -b3-  [And hence,] نَكَسَهُ, and نَكَسَهُ اـِلَى مَرَضِهِ, (tropical:)  <i>It made him to fall back into his disease.</i>] (TA, in art. هيض.) And نُكِسَ, (S, Msb, K,) or نُكِسَ فِى مَرَضِهِ, (A, TA,) inf. n. نُكْسٌ (S, Msb, K) and نَكْسٌ (TA, [but see what is said of this below]) and نُكَاسٌ, (Sh, K,) (tropical:)  <i>He relapsed into his disease, after convalescence,</i> or <i>after recovery, but not complete, of health and strength:</i> (S, A, K:) or <i>the disease returned to him;</i> [<i>he relapsed into the disease;</i>] as though he were made to turn back to it. (Msb.) You say, اَكَلَ كَذَا فَنُكِسَ (tropical:)  [<i>He ate such a thing, and relapsed into his disease</i>]. (A, TA.) And تَعْسًا لَهُ وَنُكْسًا, and sometimes one says, نَكْسًا, (S, K,) in this case, (S,) for the sake of mutual resemblance, (S, K,) or because نَكْسًا is a dial form [of نُكْسًا], (S,) [meaning, (assumed tropical:)  <i>May he fall upon his face,</i> or the like, (see art. تعس,) <i>and relapse into disease:</i> or] <i>may he fall upon his face, and not rise after his fall until he fall a second time:</i> and in like manner you say, ↓ <br>\
      تَعَسَ وَاْنْتَكَسَ. (Msb, art. تعس.) [See also 8.] You say also, نُكِسَ الجُرْحُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>The wound broke open again;</i> or <i>became recrudescent</i>]. (S, in arts. عرب and حبط, &amp;amp;c.) ―         -b4-  And نَكَسَ الطَّعَامُ وَغَيْرُهُ دَا=ءَ المَرِيضِ (tropical:)  <i>The food, &amp;amp;c., made the disease of the sick man to return.</i> (K.) And نَكَسَ الخِضَابَ عَلَى رَاْسِهِ (tropical:)  <i>He put the dye upon his head repeatedly,</i> or <i>several times.</i> (A, TA. *) ―         -b5-  Also نَكَسَ [or more probably نُكِسَ] (assumed tropical:)  <i>He</i> (a man) <i>became weak and impotent.</i> (Sh, in TA.) And نُكِسَ عَنْ نُظَرَايِهِ, like عُنِىَ, (assumed tropical:)  <i>He fell short of his fellows; was unable to attain to them.</i> (TA.) ―         -b6-  نَكَسَ رَاْسَهُ, and ↓ <br>\

      انتكس, (TA,) [and in like manner ↓ <br>\
      تنكّس, said of a flower-stalk in the M and K, voce قِشْبٌ,] <i>He bent,</i> or <i>inclined, his head;</i> (TA;) <i>he lowered,</i> or <i>stooped, his head; bent,</i> or <i>hung, it down towards the ground;</i> absolutely; or <i>by reason of abasement.</i> (So accord. to explanations of the act. part. n., below.)    </entryFree> <br>\

This last signification [understood figuratively] it is said to have in the phrase تَعَسَ وَاْنْتَكَسَ, a form of imprecation, meaning, (assumed tropical:)  <i>May he be disappointed,</i> or <i>fail, of attaining his desire:</i> for he who is overthrown in his affair (مَن اْنْتَكَسَ فِى <br>\
                  اَمْرِهِ) is disappointed of attaining his desire, and suffers loss. (TA.) [See also 1, where this form of imprecation is differently explained.] ―         -b2-  Also, <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
