      نضّب; (K;) <i>It</i> (water) <i>sank into the earth; disappeared in the earth:</i> (S, M, K, &amp;amp;c.:) and <i>became low:</i> (S:) <i>became remote.</i> (S, M.) ―         -b2-  نَضَبَ الحَوْضُ, occurring in a verse cited by Th, [<i>The water of the tank</i> or <i>cistern, sank into the earth</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b3-  نَضَبَتْ <br>\
                  عُيُونُ الطَّايِفِ [<i>The sources of El-Táïf became dried up</i>]. (A.) ―         -b4-  مَا نَضَبَ عَنْهُ البَحْرُ وَهُوَ حَىٌّ <br>\
                  فَمَاتَ فَكُلُوهُ <br>\
                  <i>That from which the water of the sea has become exhausted, and has dried up, it being alive, and which has then died, eat ye it.</i> (TA, from a trad.) ―         -b5-  كُنَّا عَلَى شَاطِيِ النَّهْرِ بِالْاَهْوَازِ <br>\
                  وَقَدْ نَضَبَ عَنْهُ المَاءُ [<i>We were on the bank of the river in El-Ahwáz, and the water had sunk,</i> or <i>receded, from it, leaving it dry</i>]. (TA, from a trad.) ―         -b6-  نَضَبَتْ عَيْنُهُ, (aor.      <br>\
                     نَضُبَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. نُضُوبٌ, TA,) (tropical:)  <i>His eye sank,</i> or <i>became depressed, in the socket:</i> or it is only said of the eye of a she-camel. (K.) ―         -b7-  نَضَبَ <br>\
                  <i>It</i> (herbage and the like, that had been abundant,) <i>became little,</i> or <i>scanty:</i> (K:) or <i>failed altogether.</i> (TA.) ―         -b8-  نَضَبَ is met. used with reference to accidents [as it is properly with respect to substances]: thus it is said in a trad., نَضَبَ عُمْرُهُ (tropical:)  <i>His life passed away,</i> or <i>ended.</i> (IAth.) This is what F means by saying نَضَبَ فُلَانٌ signifies مَاتَ, (tropical:)  <i>Such a one died.</i> (TA.) ―         -b9-  نَضَبَ خَيْرُهُ, inf. n. نُضُوبٌ, (tropical:)  <i>His goodness,</i> or <i>beneficence, became little.</i> (AZ.) ―         -b10-  نَضَبَ مَاءُ وَجْهِهِ (tropical:)  <i>He was not ashamed.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  نَضَبَ, (inf. n. نُضُوبٌ, TA,) (tropical:)  <i>It</i> (a desert) <i>was far-extending.</i> (K.) ―         -b2-  نَضَبَ, inf. n. نُضُوبٌ, (tropical:)  <i>It</i> (a people, or party,) <i>was,</i> or <i>became, distant.</i> (S.) ―         -b3-  نَضَبَ (tropical:)  <i>It</i> (a people, or party,) <i>strove,</i> or <i>used exertion,</i> [app., <i>in a journey.</i>] (TA.)       -A3-  نَضَبَ, aor.      <br>\

                  , <i>It</i> (a thing, TA,) <i>flowed, and ran</i> (K.) By our saying “ a thing, ” we mean to exclude water, though water is included in the definition of a thing: so that we need not infer from what is said in the K that the verb bears two contr. significations. (TA.) [But this observation appears to me to be scarcely admissible.] ―         -b2-  نَضَبَتِ الدَّبَرَةُ [in the copies of the K in my hands, written دَبْرَة] <i>The sore on the back of a camel &amp;amp;c. became severe.</i> (K.) نَضَبَ الدَّبَرُ (tropical:)  <i>The scar of the sore became severe and deep in the back.</i> (A.)       -A4-  نَضَبَ الثَّوْبَ <br>\
                  <i>He pulled off the garment.</i> (Msb.)    </entryFree> <br>\
                     نَضَّبَ<br>\
                   see 1 ―         -b2-  نضّبت, inf. n. تَنْضِيبٌ, <i>She</i> (a camel) <i>had little milk; and her flow thereof became slow;</i> (K;) <i>and her milk was long in flowing again into her udder after each previous milking.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>انضب القَوْسَ</b>               1     <br>\

                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>He pulled the string of the bow, in order that it might make a sound:</i> like اَنْبَضَهَا: (K:) the former verb is [said to be] an original syn. of the latter; (TA;) [and if so, it has an inf. n., as shown below:] or <i>he pulled the string of the bow, and then let it go, to make it twang:</i> or <i>he pulled the string of the bow without an arrow, and then let it go, to make it twang:</i> (TA:) or <i>he caused the bow to make a sound,</i> or <i>twang:</i> (AHn, L:) انضب <br>\
                  وَتَرَ القَوْسِ is <i>the same as</i> <br>\
                  اَنْبَضَهُ, of which it is a transp. syn. (S.) AHn, gives to it the inf. n. اـِنْضَابٌ; and yet asserts it to be formed by transposition: but this is absurd; for verbs so formed have not inf. ns.; as mentioned by Sb and Aboo- &#39;Alee and the rest of the skilful grammarians.

                  , a coll. gen. n., [I find it said to have been written with tenween by J himself: but it appears to have been also used as a generic proper name; and as such, having the measure of a verb, it must be written تَنْضُبُ, being imperfectly declinable:] <i>A certain tree:</i> the ت is augmentative, because there is no word of the measure فَعْلُلٌ; whereas there are words of the measure تَفْعُلُ, as تَقْتُلُ and تَخْرُجُ: n. un. تَنْضُبَةٌ: (S:) <i>a certain tree of El-Hijáz:</i> (K:) <i>it grows large, in the form,</i> or <i>manner, of the</i> <br>\

                  عَوْسَج: (K, TA:) <i>and it has a fruit</i> [called مَغْدٌ (L, K, art. مغد)] <i>like small grapes, which is eaten, of a reddish colour:</i> AHn says, that <i>its smoke is white, of the colour of dust; and that poets therefore liken dust to it:</i> and in one place he says, that it is <i>a large tree, without leaves</i> [<i>properly so called</i>], <i>which has a trunk, and from which grow thick boughs, with many branches; its leaves</i> [<i>if such they may be called</i>] <i>being only shoots, which are eaten by the camels and sheep and goats:</i> Aboo-Nasr says, that it is <i>a tree having short thorns: not of the trees that grow on lofty mountains; frequented by chameleons:</i> [see حِرْبَاءٌ, in art. حرب: and see an ex. in a verse cited voce سَاقٌ:] ISd thinks that it is thus called because of its little sap: AM says, that it is <i>a large tree, from which are cut tentpoles:</i> (TA:) and Ibn-Selemeh says, that it is <i>a tree from which arrows are made.</i> (S.) ―         -b2-  نُوقٌ <br>\
