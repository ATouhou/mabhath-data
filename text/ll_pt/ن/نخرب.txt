                  ; (S, K;) mentioned in the K without description of its measure because there is no Arabic word of the measure فَعْلُولْ; but some prefer it being written نَخْرُوبٌ, [as it is in the CK,] asserting its ن to be augmentative, so that its measure is نَفْعُولٌ, as IAar holds, asserting it to be derived from خَرَابٌ; (TA;) <i>A fissure,</i> or <i>cleft,</i> in a stone. (S, K.) ―         -b2-  Also, [so in the TA: in the CK and a MS. copy, or,] <i>A hole, perforation,</i> or <i>bore,</i> in anything. (K.) Pl. نَخَارِيبُ. (S.) ―         -b3-  Also, the pl., The <i>holes,</i> or <i>cells, prepared with wax for the bees to deposit their honey therein:</i> (K:) <i>holes like the cells of wasps.</i> (L.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  تَخْرَبُوتٌ] An <i>excellent, nimble,</i> or <i>agile,</i> she-camel. Some say that its ن is augmentative, and its radical letters are خرب; but its derivation from خَرَابٌ is not apparent; therefore its ن should be considered as radical. (AHei.)    </entryFree> <br>\
