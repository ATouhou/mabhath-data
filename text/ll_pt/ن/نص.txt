                  , (Mgh,) inf. n. نَصٌّ, (Mgh, TA,) <i>He raised the thing;</i> syn. رَفَعَهُ [which is here to be understood, like the English equivalent by which I have rendered it, in several senses, as the sequel will show]. (S, Mgh, TA.) This is the primary signification: (TA:) or, accord. to As, it is from نَصَّ النَّاقَةَ, q. v. infra. (S.) You say, نَصَّ العَرُوسَ, (M, K,) or نَصَّتْهَا, (A, Mgh,) or نَصَّها النِّسَا=ءُ, (Msb,) aor. as above, (A, Mgh,) and so the inf. n., (Msb,) <i>He,</i> or <i>she,</i> or <i>the women, raised,</i> (A, Msb,) or <i>seated,</i> (K,) or <i>raised and seated,</i> (Mgh,) or <i>showed,</i> or <i>displayed,</i> (M,) <i>the bride upon the</i> <br>\
                  مِنَصَّة, (M, A, Msb, K,) or <i>upon the</i> <br>\
                  مَنَصَّة. (Mgh.) And نَصَّتِ الظَّبْيَةُ جِيدَهَا <br>\
                  <i>The doe-antelope raised,</i> or <i>elevated, her neck.</i> (M, TA.) And نُصَّ فُلَانٌ <br>\
                  سَيِّدًا (tropical:)  <i>Such a one was set up as a lord,</i> or <i>chief.</i> (A, TA.) And نَصَّ المَتَاعَ, (M, K,) inf. n. as above, (M,) <i>He put the furniture,</i> or <i>goods,</i> or <i>utensils, one upon another.</i> (M, K.) Hence, (TA,) نَصَّ الحَدِيثَ, (M, Msb, TA,) or نَصَّهُ اـِلَى <br>\
                  صَاحِبِهِ, (A,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (M, Msb, TA,) (tropical:)  <i>He traced up,</i> or <i>ascribed,</i> or <i>attributed, the tradition to the author thereof, resting it on his authority, by mentioning him,</i> or <i>mentioning, uninterruptedly, in ascending order, the persons by whom it had been handed down, up to the author;</i> or <i>mentioning the person who had related it to him from the author, if only one person intervened;</i> syn. رَفَعَهُ; (M, TA;) [i. e.] رَفَعَهُ اـِلَى <br>\
                  مَنْ قَالَهُ: (Msb:) IAar says, (TA,) النَّصُّ signifies الاـِسْنَادُ اـِلَى الرَّيِيسِ الاَكْبَرِ (tropical:)  [<i>the tracing up,</i> or <i>ascribing,</i> or <i>attributing,</i> a tradition, <i>in the manner explained above, to the greatest person of authority,</i> here meaning Mohammad, or the author of the tradition]; (K, TA;) [i. e.] نَصُّ الحَدِيثِ signifies اـِسْنَادُهُ وَرَفْعُهُ اـِلَى الرَّيِيسِ الاَكْبَرِ. (Mgh.) You also say, نَصَّ الحَدِيثَ اـِلَيْهِ, (K,) or اـِلَى فُلَانٍ, (S,) (tropical:)  <i>He ascribed,</i> or <i>attributed,</i> or <i>traced up, the tradition to him,</i> or <i>to such a one, in the manner explained above;</i> syn. رَفَعَهُ. (S, K.) See also اَنَصُّ. ―         -b2-  نَصَّ الشَّىْءَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He made the thing apparent, manifest, plain,</i> or <i>evident; he showed it, exhibited it, manifested it, evinced it, discovered it,</i> or <i>revealed it.</i> (M, * K.) [The verb seems to be thus used because a thing is rendered conspicuous by being raised. See نَصَّ العَرُوسَ, above.] ―         -b3-  [Hence, نَصَّ عَلَى شَىْءٍ مَّا, aor. and inf. n. as above, (tropical:)  <i>He,</i> or <i>it,</i> (generally said of a passage in the Kur. or a trad.,) <i>made a statement,</i> or <i>a plain, explicit, unequivocal declaration, respecting some,</i> or <i>any, particular thing, not capable of application to any other thing:</i> and <i>he mentioned something,</i> or <i>anything, particularly,</i> or <i>specially; he particularized,</i> or <i>specified it by words;</i> very frequently used in these senses: and such we are to understand from the saying] النَّصُّ also signifies التَّوْقِيفُ وَالتَّعْيِينُ عَلَى شَىْءٍ مَّا: (K:) [for which I would rather read النَّصَّ عَلَى شَىْءٍ مَّا also signifies التَّوْقِيفُ وَالتَّعْيِينُ: adding the observation that التوقيف as syn. with النصّ is restricted in art. وقف in the K to a special relation to the law: and that النَّصُّ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ is often found explained as signifying تَعْيِينُهُ; as, for instance, in p. <H>377</H> of Har.:] these significations of النَّصُّ are tropical, from that word as denoting “ elevation ” and “ appearance. ” (TA.) See also نَصٌّ below. ―         -b4-  [From نَصَّهُ signifying “ he raised it, ” and consequently “ he made it apparent, ” are derived several other significations, here following.] ―         -b5-  يَنُصُّهُمْ [app. for يَنُصُّ مَا عِنْدَهُمْ] occurs in a trad. respecting Heraclius, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>He elicits, and makes apparent, their opinion:</i> (TA:) or نَصَّ الرَّجُلَ, (S, M, &amp;amp;c.,) inf. n. as above, (M,) signifies (tropical:)  <i>he went to the utmost point in questioning,</i> or <i>asking, the man respecting a thing,</i> (S, K,) <i>so as to elicit what he possessed</i> [<i>of information respecting it</i>]; (S;) i. e. (TA) (tropical:)  <i>he importuned the man in questioning,</i> or <i>asking, and urged him to tell the utmost that he knew;</i> (A, TA;) or (assumed tropical:)  <i>he questioned,</i> or <i>asked, the man respecting a thing so as to elicit the utmost that he possessed</i> [<i>of information respecting it</i>], (M.) [See also 3.] ―         -b6-  [In like manner you say,] نَصَّ النَّاقَةَ, (S, M, Mgh, K,) and الدَّابَّةَ, (M, Msb,) aor. as above, (M,) and so the inf. n., (S, M,) <i>He made the</i> <br>\
                  <i>she-camel,</i> and <i>the beast, to exert herself to the full,</i> or <i>to the utmost,</i> or <i>beyond measure, in going,</i> or <i>pace;</i> or <i>to go the pace termed</i> <br>\
                  مَرْفُوع; syn. رَفَعَهَا فِى السَّيْرِ: (M, Mgh:) or <i>he elicited her utmost pace;</i> (K, TA;) from النَّصُّ as signifying الرَّفْعُ; for the phrase رَفَعَهَا فِى السَّيْرِ necessarily implies the eliciting the utmost of her celerity of pace: (TA:) or <i>he went a vehement pace so as to elicit the utmost that she possessed</i> [<i>of celerity</i>[: (As, S:) or <i>he put her in motion so as to elicit her utmost pace:</i> (A&#39;Obeyd, TA:) or <i>he urged,</i> or <i>incited, her, and elicited her pace:</i> (Msb:) نَصَّ, alone, also occurs in a trad., (M, Msb,) as meaning رَفَعَ نَاقَتَهُ: (M:) and نَاقَتَهُ ↓ <br>\
      نَصْنَصَ signifies the same as نَصَّهَا. (IKtt, TA.) You do not say of a camel نَصَّ, making him the agent, and the verb intrans. (O, * TA.) [In the M, however, I find it said, that النَّصُّ and النَّصِيصُ signify السَّيْرُ الشَّدِيدُ; app. indicating that they are inf. ns., of which the verb is نَصَّ, aor., accord. to rule,      <br>\
                     نَصِ٣َ<br>\
                  , signifying <i>He went a vehement pace,</i> or <i>vehemently:</i> and Golius says, as on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof, that this verb is used intransitively, with نَصِيصٌ for its inf. n., as signifying <i>valide incessit:</i> but see نَصٌّ below.] ―         -b7-  [Hence, app.,] النَّصُّ also signifies The <i>urging</i> or <i>inciting</i> [a beast]; syn. الحَثُّ. (M.) ―         -b8-  And نَصَّ الشَّىْءَ, (M, K,) aor.      <br>\
                     نَصُ٣َ<br>\
                  , inf. n. نَصٌّ, (TA,) <i>He moved the thing; put it in motion,</i> or <i>into a state of commotion; agitated it; stirred it; shook it;</i> (M, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      نَصْنَصَهُ. (S, M, K.) Hence the saying, فُلَانٌ يَنُصُّ اَنْفَهُ غَضَبًا (K, TA [in the CK, incorrectly, يَنِصُّ,]) <i>Such a one moves about his nose by reason of anger.</i> (TA.) And ↓ <br>\
      نَصْنَصَ <br>\
                  لِسَانَهُ <br>\
                  <i>He moved about his tongue;</i> (S, M;) like نَضْنَضَهُ; (M;) which is a dial. form; (A&#39;Obeyd, S;) the former being the original; the ص not being, as some assert it to be, substituted for the ض; for these two letters are not of the same kind so as to be commutable.

      نصّصهُ, (K,) inf. n. تَنْصِيصٌ. (TA.) <i>He</i> (God) <i>went to the utmost length with him,</i> (namely a man,) <i>in questioning and in reckoning.</i> (TA.) [See also 1.]    </entryFree> <br>\

<b>نَصٌّ</b>               1     <br>\
                     نَصٌّ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                   The <i>end,</i> or <i>extremity,</i> of anything; (Az, S, M;) the <i>utmost,</i> or <i>extreme, extent, term, limit, point,</i> or <i>reach,</i> of a thing: this is the primary signification. (Az, TA.) It is said in a trad., (S, M,) of &#39;Alee, (S,) اـِذَا بَلَغَ النِّسَا=ءُ نَصَّ الحِقَاقِ, فَالعَصَبَةُ اَوُلَى بِهَا مِنَ الاُمِّ (S, * M, K, *) or نَصَّ <br>\
                  الحَقَايِقِ, (K, * TA,) but the former is that which is commonly known; (TA;) i. e. <i>When women attain the period of mature intellect,</i> (Mbr, S, K, TA,) <i>and know the real natures of things,</i> (K, art. حق,) [<i>then the male relations on the father&#39;s side have a better right to dispose of her</i> in marriage <i>than the mother;</i>] meaning, <i>when they attain to that age at which they are qualified to contend for their rights;</i> [accord. to the former reading;] for this is what is termed الحِقَاق: (K, * TA:) or <i>when they attain to puberty:</i> (Az, TA:) or <i>when they attain to that period at which they become objects of contention for right; when every one of the guardians asserts himself to have the best right:</i> (K:) or الحقاق in the trad. is a metaphorical term, from the same word as applied to camels [when entering upon the fourth year]; (K, * TA;) and الحقايق, also, in this case, accord. to some, properly signifies the same, being a pl. of حِقَّةٌ; (TA in art. حق;) and the meaning is, <i>when they attain to the extreme term of childhood.</i> (M, K.)       -A2-  In the conventional language of men of science, it signifies (tropical:)  <i>A thing</i> [or <i>statement</i>] <i>plainly,</i> or <i>explicitly, declared,</i> or <i>made manifest, by God,</i> and <i>his Apostle;</i> of the measure فَعْلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: (Msb:) or a نَصّ of the Kur-án, and of the traditions, is <i>an expression,</i> or <i>a phrase,</i> or <i>a sentence, indicating a particular meaning, not admitting any other than it:</i> (TA:) so in the conventional language of the lawyers and the scholastic theologians: (MF, on the خُطْبَة of the K:) or <i>a statute,</i> or <i>an ordinance, indicated by the manifest</i> or <i>plain meaning of words</i> of the Kur-án, and of the Sunneh: from النَّصُّ as denoting “ elevation ” and “ appearance: ” or, as some say, from نَصَّهُ as signifying “ he elicited, and made apparent, his opinion. ” (TA.) Hence, also, as used by the practical lawyers, it signifies (tropical:)  <i>An evidence,</i> or <i>a proof:</i> (TA:) [and particularly <i>a text of the Kur-án,</i> or <i>of the Sunneh, used as an authority in an argument, for proof of an assertion.</i>] The pl.
