                   (incorrectly written by J, in a verse which he quotes, هَنْبَاءُ, K, TA; but in an old and excellent copy of the S, I find the word written هَنَباءُ;]) and هُنَّبَى (K) and هَنَبَاءُ and ↓ <br>\
      هَنَبَى (IDrd, K) A woman <i>of weak understanding; without discrimination; stupid; foolish; of little sense:</i> (S, K:) accord. to some, as mentioned in a note by Aboo-Zekereeya, in the S, in this art., هُنَبَى signifies an <i>insane</i> woman; or one <i>possessed by a jinnee.</i> (TA.) هُنَّبَاءُ is the only word of the measure فُعَّلَاءُ known to Az. (TA.) Accord. to the K, IDrd writes اـِمْرَاَةٌ هَنَبَاءُ and هَنَبَى: but this is [thought to be] a mistake: he gives the two forms هُنَّبَاءُ and هُنَّبَى, as stated by IM and others; and, app., هَنَبَى. (TA.) ―         -b2-  The first and second of these three words also signify A man who is <i>stupid, foolish,</i> or <i>of little sense.</i> (K.)    </entryFree> <br>\
