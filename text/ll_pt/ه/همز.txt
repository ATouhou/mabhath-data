                  ء,] is from هَمَزَهُ in the first of the senses explained above; (S, Msb,) because what is termed هَمْز in speech, (S,) or هَمْزَة, (Kh, TA,) [i. e. the sound so called,] is [as it were] pressed, or squeezed, (Kh, S, TA,) from its place of utterance [by a sudden emission of the voice forced out after a compression of the passage whereby it has been stopped]. (Kh, TA.) It was said to an Arab of the desert, اَتَهْمِزُ الفَاْرَةَ, [meaning <i>Dost thou pronounce</i> <br>\

                   was explained by Mohammad as meaning (tropical:)  <i>Madness,</i> or <i>insanity;</i> syn. مُوتَةٌ, i. e. جُنُونٌ; because it arises from the goading and pressing or pinching of the devil.
