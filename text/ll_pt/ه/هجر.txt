(Mgh.) It is said in the Kur, [iv. 38,] وَاْهْجُرُوهُنَّ فِى المَضَاجِعٍ, i. e., [<i>And cut ye them off from loving intercourse</i>] <i>in the sleeping-places,</i> in order to obtain their obedience.

It is said in a trad., لَا هِجْرَةَ بَعْدَ ثَلَاثٍ [<i>There shall be no cutting off from friendly communion after three</i> nights with their days,]: the meaning is, هَجْرٌ as contr. of وَصْلٌ; i. e., such anger as exists between Muslims, or a failing, or falling short, with respect to the duties of society, exclusively of what relates to religion: but the هِجْرَة of those who follow their own natural desires [in matters of religion], and of innovators [in religion], should continue even as long as they do not repent, and return to the truth.

(Msb, TA.) ―         -b4-  [الهِجْرَةٌ, peculiarly, <i>The emigration,</i> or <i>flight,</i> (for it was really a flight,) of Mohammad, from Mekkeh to Yethrib, which latter was afterwards called El-Medeeneh. Hence, تَاْرِيخُ الهِجْرَةِ <br>\
                  <i>The era of the Hijreh,</i> or <i>Flight.</i> The epoch of this era is not the date of the Flight itself, as some have imagined, (for this took place on an uncertain day, most probably the first or second, of the third lunar month of the Arabian year,) but is the first day of the Arabian year in which the Flight happened: and as I believe that all European writers who have attempted to fix it, prior to M. Caussin de Perceval, have erred respecting it, the true date, as shown by him, (see his “ Essai sur l&#39;Histoire des Arabes, ” &amp;amp;c., in the places referred to in the index to that  work,) I think it important here to mention. The first year of the Flight was the two hundred and eleventh year of a period during which the Arabs made use of a defective luni-solar reckoning, making every third year to consist of thirteen lunar months; the others consisting of twelve such months. This mode of reckoning was abolished by Mohammad in the twelfth month of the tenth year of the Flight, at the time of the pilgrimage; whence it appears that the first year of the Flight commenced, most probably, on Monday, the nineteenth of April, A. D. 622; or perhaps on the eighteenth; for the actual appearance of the new moon properly marked its commencement, and, as the new moon happened about sunset on the sixteenth, it may perhaps have been seen on the eve of the eighteenth. According to M. Caussin de Perceval, the first ten years of the Flight commenced at the following periods. <Table><br>\

                  </Table> Thus it appears that the first and fourth and seventh years were of thirteen lunar months each; and the seventh was the last year that was thus augmented: therefore, with the eighth year commenced the reckoning by common lunar years; and from this point we may use the tables which have often been published for finding the periods of commencement of years of the Flight. We must not, however, rely upon the exact accuracy of these tables: for the commencement of the month was generally determined by actual observation of the new moon; not by calculation; and we often find that a year was commenced, according as the place of observation was low or high, or to the east or west of the place to which the calculation is adapted, or according as the sky was obscure or clear, a day later or earlier than that which is indicated in the tables; and in some cases, even two days later. The twelfth day of the third month of the first year of the Flight, the day of Mohammad&#39;s arrival at Kubà, was Monday: therefore the first day of the year was most probably the nineteenth of April, as two months of thirty days each, or twenty-nine days each, seldom occur together. But the tenth day of the first month of the sixty-first year, the day on which El-Hoseyn was slain at Kerbelà, was Friday: therefore the first day of that year, at that place, must have been Wednesday, the third of October, A. D. 680; not the first of October, as in most of the published tables above mentioned.
