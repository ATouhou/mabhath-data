                  هَيْيَة, q. v. (K.) ―         -b2-  [هَيُوَ, accord. to the K, signifies <i>the same:</i> but see below.] ―         -b3-  هَيُوَ, accord. to IHsh and others, the only verb of this form whose medial radical letter is ى: (MF:) accord. to the K, syn. with هَا=ءَ, in a sense indicated above: but IJ states that it has a superlative sense; that it is to be classed with قَضُوَ “ excellent [or how excellent (see بَطُوَ voce بُطَا=نَ)] is he in his judging! ” and رَمُوَ “ excellent [or how excellent] is he in his throwing, or shooting! ” [wherefore it signifies <i>Excellent,</i> or <i>how excellent, is he in his form</i> or <i>appearance!</i> &amp;amp;c.;] and that it is, like قَضُوَ [and رَمُوَ], invariable [as to person, tense, and mood]. He observes that, as a verb of the measure فَعُلَ is formed from one whose final radical letter is ى, [as قَضُوَ and رَمُوَ from قَضَى and رَمَى,] so is this formed on the same measure from a verb whose medial radical letter is ى: and that it is invariable [as to person, tense, and mood,] because of its resemblance, in its superlative sense, to the class of verbs of wonder, and to نِعْمَ and بِيْسَ. He further remarks, that they [the Arabs] have abstained from forming a verb on the measure فَعُلَ [variable as to person, tense, and mood,] from one whose medial radical letter is ى, fearing to make what is difficult to pronounce still more so; for in that case they would be obliged to say اَبُوعُ بُعْتُ, and بُوعَا; and, as would also happen if a variable verb of the same measure were formed from one whose final radical letter is ى, the change of ى into و, which is more difficult to pronounce, would thus become frequent.
