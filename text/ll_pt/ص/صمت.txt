(Er-Rághib, MF and TA in art. سكت.) The Arabs say, (Ks, TA,) and it is said in a trad., (TA,) لَا صَمْتَ يَوْمًا اـِلَى اللَّيْلِ, or يَوْمٌ, or يَوْمٍ, i. e. <i>There shall be no keeping silence a whole day</i> [<i>until night</i>]. (Ks, K, TA. [In the “ Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer, ” we find لا صُمَاتَ instead of لا صَمْتَ: and El-Munáwee, in his Commentary on that work, says that the keeping silence for a whole day is forbidden by the words of this trad. because it is an imitation of a Christian custom.]) And اـِذْنُهَا صُمَاتُهَا [in another trad., relating to the asking a virgin if she consent to be married, lit. <i>Her permission is her silence,</i>] means <i>her silence is</i> like <i>her permission,</i> i. e. it suffices. (Msb.) One says also, جَا=ءَ بِمَا صَا=ءَ وَصَمَتَ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He brought what was vocal and what was mute</i>]; مَا صَا=ءَ meaning <i>sheep,</i> or <i>goats, and camels;</i> and مَا صَمَتَ, <i>gold and silver:</i> (IAar, TA:) صَا=ءَ in this saying is formed by transposition from صَاَى [q. v.].

[of the imperative] that has not reached us: accord. to Yákoot, it is the name of a particular desert; but others say that the proper name [of that desert] is وَحْشُ اـِصْمِتَ.
