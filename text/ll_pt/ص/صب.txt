      تَصَبَّبْتُ [which may be rendered <i>I flowed with sweat</i>] is a phrase of the Arabs, meaning تصبّب عَرَقِى [<i>my sweat flowed</i>]: thus the act is literally ascribed to the speaker, and what is essentially the agent becomes a specificative: it is not allowable to say عَرَقًا تَصَبَّبْتُ; for, as it is not allowable to put the agent before the verb, so it is not allowable to put the specificative, when it is virtually the agent, before the verb.

                   is an inf. n.
