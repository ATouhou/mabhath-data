                  , (T, S, Msb,) aor. يَصِيرُ, (S,) inf. n. صَيْرُورَةٌ (S, Msb) and صَيْرٌ, (S,) <i>He,</i> or <i>it, attained to the state,</i> or <i>condition, of such a thing;</i> (T;) <i>became such a thing;</i> (T, Msb;) in which sense the verb is like كَانَ [in meaning, when the latter is non-attributive, and in having its subject  in the nom. case and its predicate in the accus.]. (T.) You say, صَارَ زَيْدٌ رَجُلًا <br>\
                  <i>Zeyd became a man;</i> or <i>attained to the state,</i> or <i>condition, of a man.</i> (TA.) And صَارَ زَيْدٌ غَنِيًّا <br>\
                  <i>Zeyd became rich,</i> not having been so. (Msb.) And صَارَ العَصِيرُ خَمْرًا <br>\
                  <i>The expressed juice became wine.</i> (Msb.) [And صَارَ لَا شَىْءَ عِنْدَهُ <br>\
                  <i>He became in a state,</i> or <i>condition, in which there was not anything in his possession.</i> And صَارَ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>He became in the state,</i> or <i>condition, of doing such a thing;</i> i. e. <i>he became occupied,</i> or <i>engaged, in doing such a thing;</i> or <i>he set about, began, commenced, took to,</i> or <i>betook himself to, doing such a thing;</i> like جَعَلَ. And صَارَ لَا يَفْعَلُ شَيْيًا <br>\
                  <i>He became in the state,</i> or <i>condition, of not doing anything;</i> or <i>he became unoccupied in doing anything.</i> And صَارَ لَا يَتَكَلَّمُ <br>\
                  <i>He became in the state of not speaking; he became speechless.</i> And صَارَ يَتَفَكَّرُ <br>\
                  فِى كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>He became in a state of reflection upon such a thing; he began to reflect upon such a thing.</i>] ―         -b2-  One says also, صَارَ الاَمْرُ اـِلَى كَذَا, (M, A, Msb, K,) aor. as above, (TA,) inf. n. مَصِيرٌ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) which is anomalous, being regularly مَصَارٌ, like مَعَاشٌ, (S,) and صَيْرٌ and صَيْرُورَةٌ, (M, A, K,) i. e. رَجَعَ اـِلَيْهِ: (Msb:) [but this is a loose explanation; the meaning being, <i>The thing,</i> or <i>affair,</i> or <i>case, came eventually</i> (see صِيرٌ) <i>to such a state,</i> or <i>condition:</i>] the difference between مَصِيرٌ and مَرْجِعٌ is, that the former word necessarily implies a difference [of the latter state or condition] from the former state or condition; but the latter word does not. (Bd in iii. 156.) [In this case, the ulterior state or condition is likened to a place: for] ―         -b3-  صَارَ also signifies <i>He,</i> or <i>it, attained in respect of place:</i> so in the saying, صَارَ زَيْدٌ اـِلَى عَمْرٍو [<i>Zeyd came,</i> or <i>went,</i> or <i>pursued a course that brought him, to &#39;Amr</i>]. (TA.) صِرْتُ اـِلَى فُلَانٍ [<i>I came,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>to such a one</i>] is similar to the phrase in the Kur [iii. 27] وَاـِلَى اْللّٰهِ اْلْمَصِيرُ [<i>And to God, as the ultimate object, is the transition,</i> or <i>course,</i> of every human being]. (S.) [Hence, اًلَا اـِلَى اْللّٰهِ تَصِيرُ اْلْاُمُورُ, in the Kur xlii. last verse, which Bd explains by adding the words بِاْرْتِفَاعِ الوَسَايِطِ وَالتَّعَلُّقَاتِ; the meaning being, <i>Verily to God are things,</i> or <i>events, referrible,</i> mediately and dependently: in the Expos. of the Jel expl. as meaning تَرْجِعُ.] ―         -b4-  [And in like manner one says, صَارَ لَهُ كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>Such a thing came to, betided,</i> or <i>befell, him,</i> or <i>it:</i> and hence, <i>he,</i> or <i>it, came to have,</i> or <i>became possessed of, such a thing.</i>] ―         -b5-  And صَارَ فِى اَرْضِ فَلَاةٍ [<i>He became,</i> or <i>came to be,</i> meaning <i>he found himself, in a desert,</i> or <i>waterless, land</i>]; <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  وَقَعَ فِيهَا. (Msb in art. وقع.) And صَارَ فِى الرَّبِيعِ [<i>He entered,</i> lit. <i>became in, the</i> season called ربيع]; <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  اَرْبَعَ [which is expl. in the S as signifying دَخَلَ فِى الرَّبِيعِ]. (K in art. ربع.)       -A2-  صَيْرٌ signifies also The <i>returning</i> of seekers after herbage <i>to the watering-places.</i> (O, K.) And one says, صَارَ الرَّجُلُ, aor. يَصِيرُ, [inf. n. صَيْرٌ,] <i>The man stayed,</i> or <i>abode, at the water.</i> (TA.) And صَارَ النَّاسُ المَا=ءَ <br>\
                  <i>The people stayed,</i> or <i>abode, at the water.</i> (M, K, TA.)       -A3-  صَارَهُ, (S,) first pers. صِرْتُهُ, (M,) aor. as above, (S,) inf. n. صَيْرٌ, (K,) a dial. var. of صَارَهُ having for its aor. يَصُورُهُ, [q. v.,] (S,) <i>He cut it;</i> (S, M, K;) and <i>clave it,</i> or <i>split it.</i> (M.) ―         -b2-  And in like manner, [i. e. as a dial. var. of صَارَهُ having for its aor. يَصُورُهُ,] <i>He made it to incline,</i> or <i>lean.</i> (S.) You say, صَارَ وَجْهَهُ, aor. يَصِيرُ, (M,) as also يَصُورُ, (M and K in art. صور,) <i>He turned his face</i> towards a person or thing. (M.) And صِرْتُ عُنُقَهُ <br>\
                  <i>I twisted his neck.</i> (M.) [Respecting the phrase فَصِرْهُنَّ اـِلَيْكَ in the Kur ii. 262, accord. to one reading, see 1 in art. صور.] ―         -b3-  صَارَهُ, aor. يَصِيرُ, inf. n. صَيْرٌ, signifies also حَبَسَهُ [<i>He confined, restricted,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>him,</i> or <i>it</i>].

                  اـِلَى مَا اَرَى يَا عَمِّ [<i>What hath made thee to come,</i> or <i>brought thee,</i> or <i>reduced thee, to the state,</i> or <i>condition, that I see, O my paternal uncle?</i>]. (M.) [In this case, the ulterior state or condition is likened to a place: for] you say, صَيَّرَهُ اـِلَيْهِ and ↓ <br>\
      اَصَارَهُ [meaning <i>He,</i> or <i>it, made him to come,</i> or <i>brought him, to him,</i> or <i>it;</i> i. e., to a person, or place, or to a state, or condition:] (M, K:) and صَيَّرَتْنِى اـِلَيْهِ الحَاجَةُ and ↓ <br>\
      اَصَارَتْنِى [<i>Want,</i> or <i>need,</i> or <i>necessity, made me to come,</i> or <i>brought me, to him,</i> or <i>it</i>]. (A.) And [hence,] صَيَّرَ اـِلَيْهِ <br>\
                  الاَمْرَ <br>\
                  <i>He committed to him the thing,</i> or <i>affair;</i> syn. فَوَّضَهُ اليه. (M in art. فوض.) [And صَيَّرَ لَهُ <br>\
                  كَذَا <br>\
                  <i>He made such a thing to come to, betide,</i> or <i>befall, him,</i> or <i>it:</i> and consequently, <i>he made him,</i> or <i>it, to have,</i> or <i>become possessed of, such a thing.</i>] ―         -b3-  تَصْيِيرٌ is also by word, or covenant, as well as by deed.
