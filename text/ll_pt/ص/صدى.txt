                   signifies The <i>clapping with the hands;</i> syn. تَصْفِيقٌ; (S, K;) accord. to Er-Rághib, as being like the echo (الصَّدَى), inasmuch as there is no profit in it; (TA;) or it is from الصَّدُّ, because they [who practised it in their worship] used to turn away (كَانُوا يَصُدُّونَ) from El-Islám; (K;) [see more in the second paragraph of art. صد;] and صَدْوٌ [an inf. n. of which the verb is ↓ <br>\

In the Kur xxxviii. 1, some read صَادِ, with kesr, as an imperative from المُصَادَاةُ (Bd, TA) as meaning المُعَارَضَةُ; and hence الصَّدَى [i. e. the echo], because it imitates (يُعَارِضُ) the first sound: so that the meaning is, <i>Imitate thou</i> (عَارِض) the Kur-án by thy works.

                  لَيْلِى [<i>I passed all my night minding her attentively, carefully,</i> or <i>solicitously</i>]; because he disliked binding her fore shank to her arm, as it would distress her; or leaving her, as she might go away at random and the wolf might devour her young one: and in like manner one says of the pastor, يُصَادِى اـِبِلَهُ [<i>He minds attentively,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>his camels</i>]; when they thirst before the completion of their usual period of being kept from drinking, he restricts them to journeying by night so as to arrive at water on the morrow.

                   [sometimes written صَدًا] <i>An echo;</i> i. e. الصَّدَى signifies <i>what the mountain returns to him who utters a sound,</i> or <i>voice,</i> or <i>cry, therein;</i> (K;) or <i>the sound of the mountain and the like that responds to one;</i> (M;) or <i>what responds to one with the like of his voice,</i> or <i>cry, in the mountains &amp;amp;c.</i> (S.) One says, صَمَّ صَدَاهُ (tropical:)  [<i>His echo became dumb,</i> or <i>may his echo become dumb</i>]; (S, TA;) meaning <i>he perished,</i> or <i>may he perish:</i> (S and K and TA in art. صم:) and اَصَمَّ اْللّٰهُ صَدَاهُ (tropical:)  [<i>May God make his echo to return no sound</i>]; (S, K, TA;) meaning <i>may God destroy him:</i> (S, K, and TA in art. صم:) for when a man dies, the صدى hears not from him anything, that it should respond to him.
