                   [part. n. of صَبَاَ: and as such signifying] One <i>who departs from his religion to another religion.</i> (Msb.) The Arabs used to call the Prophet الصَّابِى [for الصَّابِيُ], because he departed from the religion of Kureysh to El-Islám; and him who entered the religion of El-Islám, مَصْبُوٌّ, changing the ء to و; and the Muslims [collectively], الصُّبَاةٌ, as though pl. of الصَّابِىِ, without ء, like قُضَاةٌ and غُزَاةٌ pls. of قَاضٍ and غَازٍ. (TA.) And [the pl.] الصَّابِيُونَ in the Kur [v. 73, &amp;amp;c.,] is said by Zj to mean <i>Those who depart from one religion to another.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  Then this appellation, صَابِيٌ, was applied to [<i>Any individual of</i>] <i>a certain sect of the unbelievers,</i> [<i>the Sabians,</i>] <i>said to worship the stars secretly, and openly to profess themselves to belong to the Christians:</i> they are called الصَّابِيَةُ and الضَّابِيُونَ: <i>and they assert that they are of the religion of Sábi the son of Sheyth</i> [or <i>Seth</i>] <i>the son of Adam:</i> their appellation may also be pronounced الصَّابِيُونَ, and thus Náfi&#39; read it [in the Kur]: (Msb:) or the صَابِيُونَ are <i>a certain class of the people who possess revealed scripture:</i> (S:) or <i>a people whose religion resembles that of the Christians, except that their kibleh is towards the place whence blows the</i> [<i>south,</i> or <i>southerly, wind called</i>] جَنُوب: (Lth, T, TA:) [or] <i>whose kibleh is from</i> (مِنْ [or this may mean <i>some point of</i>]) <i>the place whence blows the</i> [<i>north,</i> or <i>northerly, wind called</i>] شَمَال <br>\
                  <i>at midday:</i> (M, K:) or, accord. to some, <i>their kibleh is the Kaabeh:</i> (MF:) <i>and they assert that they are of the religion of Noah,</i> (Lth, T, M, K,) <i>lyingly:</i> (Lth, T, M:) in the R it is said that they are thus called in relation to Sábi the son of Lámak [or Lamech], the brother of Noah: Bd says, it is said that they are <i>worshippers of the angels:</i> and it is said that they are <i>worshippers of the stars:</i> and that their appellation is Arabic; from صَبَاَ “ he departed from a religion; ” or from صَبَا “ he inclined, ” because of their inclining from truth to falsehood.
