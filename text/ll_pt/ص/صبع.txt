                  , (AZ, S, K,) inf. n. صَبْعٌ, (AZ, S,) <i>He pointed at him,</i> or <i>towards him, with his finger,</i> (بِاـِصْبَعِهِ,) <i>disparagingly:</i> (AZ, S, K:) or, as some say, <i>he meant some evil thing to him when he</i> (the latter) <i>was inadvertent, not knowing.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  And صَبَعَ فُلَانًا عَلَى فُلَانٍ <br>\
                  <i>He directed such a one to such a one by pointing,</i> or <i>indication:</i> (S, K:) because, when one directs a man to a way, or road, or to a thing that is latent, or obscure, he points towards it with the finger. (TA.) One says, مَا صَبَعَكَ عَلَيْنَا <br>\
                  <i>What directed thee to us?</i> (TA.) And صَبَعَ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ <br>\
                  <i>He directed others to the people,</i> or <i>party.</i> (TA.) Of one who magnifies himself, or acts proudly, in his government, or administration, one says, صَبَعَهُ الشَّيْطَانُ (assumed tropical:)  [app. meaning <i>The Devil has directed him</i>]: and اَدْرَكَتْهُ اَصَابِعُ الشَّيْطَانِ [<i>The fingers of the Devil have reached him</i>]. (TA. [See the pass. part. n. below.]) ―         -b3-  And one says, قُرِّبَ اـِلَيْهِ طَعَامٌ فَمَا صَبَعَ فِيهِ i. e. [<i>Food was presented,</i> or <i>offered, to him,</i> or <i>was placed,</i> or <i>put, before him, and</i>] <i>he did not put his finger into it.</i> (TA.) [See also صَبَاَ, near the end.] ―         -b4-  And صَبَعَ <br>\
                  الدَّجَاجَةَ, (O, K,) inf. n. as above. (TA,) <i>He inserted his finger into the hen in order that he might know if she were</i> [<i>near</i>] <i>laying an egg or not:</i> (O, K:) mentioned by Z. (TA.) ―         -b5-  And صَبَعَ <br>\

                  <i>He put his finger upon the vessel so that what was in another vessel flowed upon it</i> [<i>into the former vessel</i>]: (A&#39;Obeyd, S, O, K:) or, as some say, <i>he put together his two fingers,</i> [or <i>two of his fingers,</i>] <i>then discharged,</i> or <i>let flow, what was in the vessel,</i> of wine, or beverage, <i>into a thing with a narrow head</i> [or <i>mouth</i>]: or, accord. to Az, <i>he discharged,</i> or <i>let flow, what was in the vessel,</i> of wine, or beverage, <i>between the extremities of</i> [<i>either of</i>] <i>his two thumbs and fore fingers, in order that it might not become scattered, and pour forth copiously.</i> (TA.) ―         -b6-  And صَبَعَهُ, inf. n. as above, <i>He hit,</i> or <i>hurt, his finger.</i> (TA.)       -A2-  صَبَعَ عَلَى القَوْمِ, inf. n. as above, meaning <i>He came forth upon the people,</i> or <i>party,</i> is said to be originally صَبَاَ, with ء.

                  , followed by عَلَى, is said by Freytag, as on the authority of Meyd, to signify <i>He</i> (a pastor) <i>fed and managed well</i> his cattle: but this is perhaps taken from a mistranscription of the saying, mentioned by Meyd, لِلرَّاعِى عَلَى مَاشِيَتَهِ <br>\

(M, on a verse cited in the first paragraph of art. ثنى.) [See also two similar exs. in the first paragraph of art. حنو and حنى.] ―         -b3-  And لِلرَّاعِى عَلَى مَاشِيَتِهِ اـِصْبَعٌ (tropical:)  [<i>The pastor has a finger pointing at his cattle,</i> or <i>camels</i> or <i>sheep</i> or <i>goats</i>]; meaning, [<i>has upon his cattle</i>] <i>an impress of a good state</i> or <i>condition;</i> (S, K, * TA;) i. e. they are pointed at with the fingers because of their goodliness and fatness and good tending.
