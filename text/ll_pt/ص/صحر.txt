                   [صِحَارٌ is an inf. n. of صَاحَرَ, a verb not mentioned: hence,] اَبْرَزَ لَهُ مَا فِى نَفْسِهِ مِنَ الاَمْرِ <br>\
                  صِحَارَا (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He showed to him what was in his mind, of the thing,</i> or <i>affair, openly</i>]: a saying like جَاهَرَهُ بِهِ جِهَارًا. (K, * TA. [See also 4.])    </entryFree> <br>\

                  , (S, A, Mgh, K,) or اصحر الصَّحْرَا=ءَ, (Msb, [but I think that this is a mistake for اصحر اـِلَى الصَّحْرَا=ءِ,]) inf. n. اـِصْحَارٌ, (Msb,) <i>He went forth to the</i> <br>\

                  صحرا=ء: (Msb, K:) تصحّر [in this sense] has not been heard. (Mgh.) ―         -b2-  Hence, in a trad., the saying of Umm-Selemeh to &#39;Áïsheh, سَكَّنَ اْللّٰهُ عُقَيْرَاكِ فَلَا تُصْحِرِيهَا [app. meaning, accord. to explanations of it in the TA in art. عقر, <i>God hath made thy dwelling and estate,</i> or, as Z explains it, <i>thy person</i> (نَفْسَكِ), <i>to be quietly settled, therefore do not thou remove it forth to the desert</i>]; i. e. لَا تُبْرِزِيهَا اـِلَى الصَّحْرَا=ءِ; the verb, accord. to IAth, being made trans. by  the suppression of the prep.; [i. e. تُصْحِرِيهَا being for تُصْحِرِى بِهَا;] for it is [properly] intrans. (TA. [See also the next sentence but one, in which the verb is tropically made trans.]) ―         -b3-  اَصْحِرْ لِعَدُوِّكَ means (assumed tropical:)  <i>Be thou in a state of clearness</i> [or <i>certainty</i>] <i>with respect to the case of thy enemy:</i> (JM, TA:) occurring in a trad. of &#39;Alee. (TA.) ―         -b4-  One says also, اَصْحَرَ بِالاَمْرِ and اَصْحَرَهُ (tropical:)  <i>He revealed,</i> or <i>made manifest, the affair,</i> or <i>case:</i> and لَا تُصْحِرْ اَمْرَكَ (tropical:)  [<i>Reveal not thy affair,</i> or <i>case</i>]: and اَصْحِرْهُ بِمَا فِى قَلْبِكَ (tropical:)  [<i>Reveal to him what is in thy mind</i>]. (A, TA.) ―         -b5-  اصحر said of a place, <i>It was,</i> or <i>became, wide,</i> or <i>spacious;</i> (O, K, TA;) i. e. <i>it became like the</i> <br>\
                  صَحْرَا=ء. (TA.)       -A2-  Said of a man, <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, blind of one eye.</i> (K.)    </entryFree> <br>\

                  , imperfectly decl., (S, K,) though not an epithet; (S;) or it is an epithet in which the quality of a subst. predominates; (TA;) and is imperfectly decl. because it is of the fem. gender, (S,) and because the letter characteristic of the fem. gender [namely the long ا] is inseparable from it, (S, K,) <i>A desert; a waste;</i> syn. بَرِّيَّةٌ: (S, Msb:) or <i>a tract of land like the back of a beast, bare,</i> or <i>destitute of herbage, without trees and without hills and without mountains; smooth</i> [<i>throughout</i>]: (ISh:) or <i>a plain,</i> or <i>level tract of land, with smoothness and ruggedness,</i> (A, K,) <i>less</i> [<i>rugged</i>] <i>than what is termed</i> <br>\
                  قُفّ: (K:) or <i>a spacious tract of ground in which is no herbage:</i> (M, A, K:) or the <i>most plain and even of land, whether it have produced herbage or not, not having any mountain or hill near it;</i> as also جَهَادٌ: (ISh, TA in art. جهد:) you say صَحْرَا=ءُ <br>\
                  وَاسِعَةٌ [<i>a wide desert</i> &amp;amp;c.]; (S;) but you do not say صَحْرَا=ءَةٌ, adding one fem. sign after another: (S, Msb:) the pls. are صَحَارِىُّ (S, Msb, K) and صَحَارٍ (S, M, Msb) [in the K, صَحَارِى, which, without the art. ال, and except when it is prefixed to another noun, and in a case of pausing, is a manifest mistake, as is shown in every complete treatise on inflection,] and صَحَارَى (S, Msb, K) and صَحْرَاوَاتٌ: (S, K:) the first of which four pls. occurs in poetry, and is the original form of the second: for when you form the pl. of صَحْرَا=ءُ, [which is originally صَحْرَاا,] you introduce an ا between the ح and the ر, and give kesr to the ر as in all similar cases: then the first ا which is after the ر [in صحراا] is changed into ى, because of the kesreh preceding it; and the second ا, which is the characteristic of the fem. gender, is also changed into ى, and incorporated into the former: then they reject the first ى, and change the second into ا, [though still writing it ى,] and say صَحَارَى, with fet-h to the ر, that the ا may not be elided in the case of tenween, [which the word would have if the ر were with kesr]; and this they do to distinguish between the ى that is changed from the ا which is a characteristic of the fem. gender and the ى that is changed from the ا which is not a characteristic of the fem. gender as the ا of مَرْمًى when they say مَرَامٍ: some of the Arabs, however, do not reject the first ى [in صَحَارِىُّ], but reject the second ى, and say الصَّحَارِى, with kesr to the ر, and هٰذِهِ صَحَارٍ, like as you say جَوَارٍ (S. [In the Ham, p. 54, صُحَرٌ is mentioned as a pl. of صَحْرَا=ءُ; but I think it doubtful.])    </entryFree> <br>\
