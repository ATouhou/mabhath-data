                     صَنَعَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. صُنْعٌ and صَنْعٌ, <i>He made, wrought, manufactured, fabricated,</i> or <i>constructed, the thing;</i> syn. عَمِلَهُ: (K:) [or <i>he made it,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>skilfully,</i> or <i>well;</i> for] الصُّنْعُ signifies اـِجَادَةُ الفِعْلِ; and every صُنْع is a فِعْل, but every فِعْل is not a صُنْع; and it is not predicated of [irrational] animals [unless tropically, (see اَصْنَعُ,)] nor of inanimate things, like as الفِعْلُ is. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] صَنَعَ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He fabricated</i> speech or a saying or sentence or the like:] <i>he forged</i> a word; and poetry, عَلَى <br>\
                  فُلَانٍ <br>\
                  <i>in the name of such a one.</i> (Mz, 8th نوع.) ―         -b3-  And صَنَعَ, inf. n. صَنْعٌ [and صُنْعٌ] and صَنِيعٌ, [with the objective complement understood,] <i>He worked,</i> or <i>wrought; he practised,</i> or <i>exercised, an art, a craft,</i> or <i>a manufacture.</i> (MA.) ―         -b4-  And صَنَعَ اـِلَيْهِ مَعْرُوفًا, (S, O, K,) aor. as above, (K,) inf. n. صُنْعٌ, with damm, <i>He did to him a benefit, favour,</i> or <i>kind act:</i> and صَنَعَ بِهِ صَنِيعًا <br>\
                  قَبِيحًا <br>\
                  <i>he did to him an evil,</i> or <i>a foul, deed:</i> syn. فَعَلَهُ: (S, O, K:) and one says also [in the former of these two senses], عِنْدَهُ صَنِيعَةً ↓ <br>\
      اِصْطَنَعَ; (S, Mgh, K;) syn. اِتَّخَذَهَا; (K;) or اَحْسَنَ اـِلَيْهِ. (Mgh.) The saying مَا صَنَعْتَ وَاَبَاكَ means مَعَ <br>\
                  اَبِيكَ [i. e. <i>What didst thou together with thy father?</i>]. (S.) The saying of the Prophet, اـِذَا لَمْ تَسْتَحْىِ فَاْصْنَعْ مَا شِيْتَ [<i>If thou be not ashamed, do what thou wilt,</i>] is said to be an instance of an imperative phrase of which the meaning is predicative; i. e. it is as though he said, he who is not ashamed does what he will: (O, L, TA: *) and other explanations of it are mentioned in the O and L: (TA:) [but] this is held by A &#39;Obeyd to be the right meaning. (L.) In the phrase صُنْعَ اْللّٰهِ, in the Kur [xxvii. 90, which may be rendered <i>By the doing of God</i>], صنع is in the accus. case as an inf. n.: but one may read it in the nom. case, meaning ذٰلِكَ to be understood before it. (Zj, O, TA.) One says also, مَا اَحْسَنَ صُنْعَ اْللّٰهِ عِنْدَكَ and صَنِيعَ اْللّٰهِ [<i>How good is the doing of God with thee,</i> or <i>at thine abode!</i>]. (K.) ―         -b5-  And صَنَعْتُ فَرَسِى, inf. n. صَنْعٌ and صَنْعَةٌ, (tropical:)  <i>I tended well my horse;</i> or <i>took good care of him;</i> (S, O, K, TA;) <i>supplied him with fodder, and fattened him:</i> and صَنَعَ جَارِيَتَهُ (tropical:)  <i>he reared,</i> or <i>nourished, his girl,</i> or <i>young woman:</i> (TA:) and صُنِعَتِ الجَارِيَةُ (tropical:)  <i>the girl,</i> or <i>young woman, was treated</i> [or <i>nourished</i>] <i>well, so that she became fat;</i> as also ↓ <br>\
      صُنِّعَت, inf. n. تَصْنِيعٌ: (K, TA:) or you say اِصْنَعِ الفَرَسَ, (so accord. to my MS. copy of the K,) or الفَرَسَ ↓ <br>\
      اَصْنَعَ, (so accord. to other copies of the K, and in the O, [in the CK اُصْنِعَ الفَرَسُ,]) without teshdeed; [which seems to indicate that the right reading is صَنَعَ, agreeably with the reading in my MS. copy of the K which gives the imperative form; though it is stated in the TA that اَصْنَعَ الفَرَسَ is said by IKtt to be a dial. var. of صَنَعَهُ;] (O, K;) and الجَارِيَةَ ↓ <br>\
      صَنَّعَ,  with teshdeed, meaning <i>he treated</i> [or <i>nourished</i>] <i>well the girl,</i> or <i>young woman, and fattened her;</i> (O, K; [in my MS. copy of the K صَنِّعِ الجَارِيَةَ;]) because the تصنيع of the girl, or young woman, is by means of many things, and by careful tending: (O, K:) so says Lth: (O:) but Az says that by other, or others, than Lth, it is allowed to say صَنَعَ جَارِيَتَهُ, without teshdeed: and hence the phrase in the Kur [xx. 40.], وَلِتُصْنَعَ عَلَى عَيْنِى, (TA,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  [<i>And</i> this I did] <i>that thou mightest be reared and nourished in my sight;</i> (O, TA;) for which some read وَلِْتُصْنَعْ, as an imperative; and some, وَلِتَصْنَعَ, meaning <i>and that thou mightest work in my sight,</i> (Ksh, Bd,) lest thou shouldst do so contrary to my command. (Bd.) You say likewise, of a woman, صَنَعَتْ نَفْسَهَا: see 5. And you say also ↓ <br>\
      اِصْطَنَعْتُهُ, meaning (tropical:)  <i>I reared him;</i> and <i>educated, disciplined,</i> or <i>trained, him well.</i> (S, * O, K, TA.)       -A2-  Accord. to IDrst, صَنِعَ, inf. n. صَنَعٌ, signifies <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, skilled,</i> or <i>skilful:</i> but IB says that صَنِعَ has not been heard.

                     ذ<br>\
                   primarily signifies The <i>doing to one a thing in order that he may do another thing to the doer of the former thing.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  Hence, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  The <i>treating with gentleness,</i> or <i>blandishment; soothing, coaxing, wheedling,</i> or <i>cajoling;</i> and <i>endeavouring to conciliate.</i> (O, K, TA.) Or this is from the last of the following significations. (TA.) You say صانعهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He treated him with gentleness,</i> or <i>blandishment;</i> &amp;amp;c. (O, TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  <i>He acted hypocritically with him.</i> (TA.) And صانعهُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He strove,</i> or <i>endeavoured, to turn him from the thing by deceit,</i> or <i>guile.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  And hence, (A, TA,) or from the last signification in this paragraph, (TA,) (tropical:)  The act of <i>bribing.</i> (S, O, Msb, * K, * TA.) One says, صانع <br>\
                  الوَالِىَ (tropical:)  <i>He bribed</i> [<i>the prefect, ruler, judge,</i> or <i>the like</i>]. (TA.) And صانعهُ بِالمَالِ (tropical:)  <i>He bribed him with property, wealth,</i> or <i>money.</i> (Mgh, TA. *) And it is said in a prov., مَنْ صَانَعَ بِالمَالِ لَمْ <br>\
                  يَحْتَشِمْ مِنْ طَلَبِ الحَاجَةِ (tropical:)  [<i>He who bribes with property is not ashamed of demanding the thing wanted</i>]. (S, O, TA.) ―         -b4-  Also (tropical:)  A horse&#39;s <i>not putting forth,</i> or <i>giving, the whole of his strength in going; reserving somewhat thereof:</i> one says, يُصَانِعُكَ بِبَذْلِهِ سَيْرَهُ (tropical:)  [<i>He keeps back from thee somewhat by the manner in which he exerts his power of going</i>].

                  <i>He</i> (a man, O) <i>aided,</i> or <i>assisted, another.</i> (O, K.) And accord. to Ibn-&#39;Abbád, followed in the O and TS and K, one says also, اصنع الاَخْرَقُ, meaning <i>The unskilful learned, and did soundly, thoroughly, skilfully,</i> or <i>well:</i> but this is a mistake, occasioned by his deeming dubious, or obscure, a passage in the Nawádir of IAar, where the latter says that اصنع الرَّجُلُ means اَعَانَ الاَخْرَقَ [i. e. <i>The man aided,</i> or <i>assisted, the unskilful</i>]. (TA.)       -A2-  اصنع الفَرَسَ: see 1, latter half. [Freytag states, as on the authority of the K, that اَصْنَعَ, said of a horse, signifies “ Non omnibus viribus usus cucurrit, sed ita tamen ut eques eo contentus esset ” (which is nearly the same as a signification of صَانَعَ likewise mentioned by him): but this is a mistake.]    </entryFree> <br>\

                   see 1, former half. ―         -b2-  Accord. to Er-Rághib, اِصْطِنَاعٌ signifies The <i>exceeding the usual,</i> or <i>ordinary, bounds,</i> or <i>degree, in putting</i> a thing <i>into a good, sound, right,</i> or <i>proper, state.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  And hence, he says, the phrase in the Kur [xx. 43], وَاْصْطَنَعْتُكَ لِنَفْسِى, which means (assumed tropical:)  <i>And I have chosen thee</i> [<i>for myself</i>] to establish my evidence and to serve as my spokesman between me and my creatures so that thy doing thus shall be as though I did it: (TA:) or it means <i>I have reared thee,</i> (Az, TA,) or <i>I have chosen thee,</i> (O, K, TA,) [<i>for myself,</i>] for a special affair which I require thee to accomplish in a sufficient manner, (Az, O, K, TA,) concerning Pharaoh and his forces. (Az, TA.) See also 1, last sentence but one. ―         -b4-  One says also, اصطنع خَاتَمًا <br>\
                  <i>He ordered that a signet-ring should be made for him.</i> (O, K.) [See also 10.] ―         -b5-  And اصطنعهُ [in which the pronoun seems to refer to رِزْق i. e. sustenance, &amp;amp;c.,] also signifies قَدَّمَهُ [app. meaning <i>He offered it</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b6-  And اصطنع [alone, for اصطنع مَصْنَعَةً,] (tropical:)  <i>He made,</i> or <i>prepared, a repast, feast,</i> or <i>banquet, to which to invite friends.</i> (O, K, TA.)
