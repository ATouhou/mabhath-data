                  <i>The</i> [<i>trees called</i>] عضاه <br>\
                  <i>became green:</i> (M:) and صنّف الشَّجَرُ <br>\
                  <i>the trees put forth their leaves:</i> (O, K: [and the like is said in the Msb:]) AHn says that this signifies <i>the trees began to leaf, so that they were of two sorts, one sort that had leaved and one sort that had not leaved;</i> but this is not a valid saying; and in like manner ↓ <br>\
      تصنّف: (M:) accord. to the A, both signify <i>the trees became of different sorts;</i> and in like manner النَّبَاتُ [<i>the plants,</i> or <i>herbage</i>]: (TA:) and صنّف <br>\
                  الثَّمَرُ, inf. n. as above, signifies <i>the fruits became so that some of them were ripe exclusively of others, and some of them coloured exclusively of others:</i> (Msb:) and الاَرْطَى ↓ <br>\
      تصنّف, and النَّبْتُ, <i>the</i> [<i>trees called</i>] ارطى, and <i>the plants,</i> or <i>herbage, broke forth to leaf.</i> (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.) &#39;ObeydAlláh Ibn-Keys-er-Rukeiyát says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  الشَّجَرُ, not from صنّفهُ; and that J has erred in the reading that he has given; for the reading given by J, who ascribes this verse to Ibn-Ahmar, is صُنِّفَ; but this is the reading of Fr, [as is said in the O,] and both readings are correct; and of the latter, [accord. to which the meaning is, <i>and of such as have been made to consist of various sorts</i> or <i>species, of the fig-trees and the grape-vines thereof,</i>] MF says, it is that which the case requires, the commendation being for the abundance and variety of the fruits of the trees, rather than for the trees putting forth their leaves.
