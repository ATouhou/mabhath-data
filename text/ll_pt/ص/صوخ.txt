                   (S, A, K, TA) and اـِلَيْهِ, (A, TA,) inf. n. اـِصَاخَةٌ, (TA,) <i>He listened to him,</i> or <i>it.</i> (S, K, TA.) [See a verse of Aboo-Du-ád (cited here as an ex. in the S and TA) voce نَاشِدٌ.] ―         -b2-  And اصاخ signifies also (tropical:)  <i>He was silent,</i> or <i>spake not,</i> or <i>ceased from speaking:</i> so in the saying, اَصَاخَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى حَقِّ فُلَانٍ, meaning (tropical:)  <i>Such a one was silent respecting the right,</i> or <i>due, of such a one, that he might take it away.</i> (A, TA.) [And it is said that] it signifies thus in the prov., اَصَاخَ اـِصَاخَةَ المِنْدَهِ لِلنَّاشِدِ, i. e. <i>He was silent with the silence of the frequent chider of camels</i> [or <i>of him who drives and chides many camels</i>] <i>to one making known,</i> or <i>giving information of, a thing lost:</i> applied to him who strives, or labours, in seeking [a thing] and then lacks ability, and desists. (Meyd. [But the verse cited voce نَاشِدٌ suggests another rendering, which I think preferable. In Freytag&#39;s “ Arab. Prov. ” i. 718, للناشد is omitted.])   </entryFree> <br>\
