                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>A sign for the guidance of travellers, consisting of stones,</i> (AA, S, IAth, Msb,) <i>set up</i> (IAth, Msb) <i>in the way</i> (Msb) <i>in an unknown desert:</i> (IAth:) or <i>a stone that is a sign</i> [<i>for guidance</i>] <i>in the way:</i> (M, K:) or <i>an elevated sign of the way, set up in rugged ground:</i> (M:) pl. صُوًى (AA, S, M, IAth, Msb) and pl. pl. اَصْوَا=ءٌ, (M, Msb, K,) the latter like اَرْطَابٌ pl. of رُطَبٌ, (Msb, TA,) or, as some say, this is a pl., not a pl. pl. (TA.) It is said in a trad., اـِنَّ <br>\
                  لِلْاـِسْلَامِ صُوًى وَمَنَارًا كَمَنَارِ الطَّرِيقِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Verily ElIslám has signs and marks of guidance like those of the way</i>]. (S.) ―         -b2-  Hence [the pl.] اًصْوَا=ءٌ is applied to signify <i>Graves:</i> (S:) occurring in a trad. in this sense. (TA.) ―         -b3-  And the sing., (S, K,) accord. to As, (S,) signifies <i>Rugged and elevated ground,</i> (S, K,) <i>but inferior to a mountain:</i> (S:) or <i>an elevated and a rugged spot, upon which, sometimes, stones are set up in order that one may be directed thereby to the right way;</i> like ثُوَّةٌ. (M in art. ثو.) ―         -b4-  And <i>A place of varying,</i> or <i>of coming and going,</i> (مُخْتَلَف) <i>of the wind:</i> (S, K:) a poet says, (namely, Imra-el- Keys, TA,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        وَهَبَّتْ لَهُ رِيحٌ بِمُخْتَلَفِ الصُّوَى<br>\
                  </quote> [meaning, if the explanation be correct, and the citation appropriate, <i>And a wind blew them</i> (referring to the word جَمْر, i. e. live coals, in a verse immediately preceding) <i>in the place of varying of the places of varying of the wind</i>]: (S:) but Aboo-Zekereeyà, in the margin of his book [or his copy of the S], throws doubt upon the word meaning “ wind ” [in this explanation]. (TA. [See De Slane&#39;s “ Diwan d&#39;Amro&#39;lkais, ” p. 20 of the Arabic text and p. 34 of his translation.])       -A2-  Also <i>An assemblage of beasts,</i> or <i>birds, of prey:</i> (M, K:) on the authority of Kr. (M.)       -A3-  And The <i>sound of the echo:</i> (K:) mentioned by Az; but written by him with fet-h [i. e. ↓ <br>\
      صَوَّةٌ]. (TA.)       -A4-  اَخَذَهُ بِصُوَاهُ, expl. in the K as meaning <i>He took it in its fresh state</i> (بِطَرَا=ءَتِهِ [in the CK erroneously باَطْرافِه]), is a mistranscription; correctly, بِصَرَاهُ, with fet-h to the ص, and with ر, as written by Az. (TA. [صَرًا and صَرَاوَةٌ, both omitted in the K, are expl. in their proper place in the TA as syn. with جِدَّةٌ and غَضَاضَةٌ.])   </entryFree> <br>\
