                   [an inf. n.

                  </quote> [<i>O thou, the rider urging on his beast, ask the sons of Asad what is this clamour?</i>], (S, M, Msb,) the poet has made الصوت fem. because meaning thereby. الضَّوْضَا=ء and الجَلَبَة and الاِسْتِغَاثَة, (S,) or he has made it fem. as meaning الصَّيْحَة, (M, Msb,) or الاِسْتِغَاثَة: (M:) the like is often done by the Arabs, when two words, masc. and fem., are syn.: thus they say, اَقْبَلَتِ العِشَا=ءُ, meaning العَشِيَّةُ; and هٰذَا العَشِيَّةُ, meaning العِشَا=ءُ: (Msb:) but the making a masc. n. fem. for this reason is bad; though the reverse is held to be allowable. (M.) The Arabs say, اَسْمَعُ صَوْتًا <br>\
                  وَاَرَى فَوْتًا, meaning <i>I hear a sound,</i> or <i>voice, but I see not a deed.</i> (TA.) بِصَوْتِكَ in the Kur xvii. 66 is said to mean <i>With the sounds of</i> [<i>thy</i>] <i>singing, and musical pipes.</i> (M, TA.) ―         -b2-  اِسْمُ <br>\
                  صَوْتٍ is a term applied to <i>A noun significant of a sound:</i> nouns of this kind being of two classes; namely, <i>nouns applied to the purpose of addressing irrational beings, or what are virtually in the predicament of irrational beings, as young infants;</i> and <i>onomatopœias,</i> or <i>nouns imitative of sounds:</i> the former class consists of two descriptions of words; namely, <i>ejaculations used for the purpose of chiding,</i> as هَلَا (to horses) and عَدَسْ (to mules) and كِخْ كِخْ (to a young infant);  and <i>ejaculations used for the purpose of calling,</i> as جِىْء (to camels) and تُشَاْ (to an ass): of the other class are غَاقِ (imitative of the cry of the crow) and طَقْ (imitative of the sound produced by the falling of stones) and قبْ (imitative of the sound produced by the fall of a sword) &amp;amp;c.: nouns significant of sounds are generally indecl., because they resemble certain particles in neither governing nor being governed; but some of them are occasionally decl. [like other nouns]. (ElAshmoonee&#39;s Expos. of the Alfeeyeh of Ibn-Málik, section اسماء الافعال والاصوات.) ―         -b3-  See also the next paragraph, in four places.    </entryFree> <br>\

(A.) It is said in a trad., مَا مِنْ عَبْدٍ اـِلَّا لَهُ صِيتٌ فِى السَّمَا=ءِ, meaning [<i>There is no servant</i> of God, i. e. <i>no man, but he has</i>] <i>a report by which he is known</i> [<i>in Heaven</i>]; and it may be in respect of good and evil.
