      صَنَابِرُ signifies <i>Slender arrows;</i> (T, M;) accord. to IAar: [ISd says,] I have not found it save on his authority; and he has not mentioned a sing. thereof: (M:) [but] accord. to the T, they are so called as being likened to the صَنَابِر [a pl. of صُنْبُورٌ] of the palm-tree: (TA:) occurring in this sense in a verse cited voce ذِلَّةٌ.

      بِصَنَوْبَرِهِ] is a saying mentioned by Ibn- &#39;Abbád as meaning <i>I took the thing altogether.</i> (O.)    </entryFree> <br>\

      صِنَبْرٌ, (O,) <i>Cold,</i> as a subst.; (M, O;) as also صِنِّبْرٌ: (O:) or <i>cold clouds:</i> (IDrd, O:) or <i>a cold wind</i> (M, K) <i>with mist</i> or <i>clouds:</i> (M:) occurring in a verse of Tarafeh with kesr to the ب: (M:) [see also صُنْبُورٌ:] or صِنَّبِرٌ, occurring in that verse, signifies the <i>intense cold</i> of winter; (S in art. صبر;) as also ↓ <br>\
      صَنَابِرُ, (S, K,) of which the  sing. is ↓ <br>\
      صُنْبُورٌ. (TA.) On the expression of Tarafeh, حِينَ هَاجَ الصِّنَّبِرْ, [<i>when the cold wind, with mist, rises,</i>] ending a verse, IJ says that the poet means الصِّنَّبْرُ; but requiring to make the ب movent, he transfers to it the final vowel, as in the phrases هٰذَا بَكُرْ and مَرَرْتُ بِبَكِرْ: he should therefore have said الصِّنَّبُرْ; but regarding the expression as meaning حِينَ هَيْجِ الصِّنَّبْرِ, he makes the ب to be with kesr, as though he transferred to it the kesreh of the ر: this, he adds, is more probable than the opinion that the change is merely one of poetic necessity. (M.) For this last reason, another poet uses the word with teshdeed to the ن and ر, and with kesr to the ب; saying, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
