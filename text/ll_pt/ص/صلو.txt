                  , (S, M, K,) quasi-inf. n. صَلَاةٌ or صَلٰوة, for which one should not say تَصْلِيَةٌ, (S, K,) or the latter is allowable as agreeable with rule and as occurring in old poetry, (MF, TA,) <i>He prayed, supplicated,</i> or <i>petitioned:</i> (S, M, K:) and [particularly] <i>he performed the divinely-appointed act</i> [<i>of prayer commonly</i>] <i>termed</i> <br>\
                  صَلَاة or صَلٰوة. (S.) Hence, in the Kur [ix. 104], (TA,) وَصَلِّ عَلَيْهِمْ <br>\
                  <i>And pray thou for them.</i> (Msb, TA.) صَلَّى عَلَى <br>\
                  فُلَانٍ means <i>He prayed for such a one, and praised him.</i> (TA.) And hence the verse of ElAashà cited in art. رسم, conj. 8. (S, Mgh, * TA.) It is said in a trad., مَنْ دُعِىَ اـِلَى وَلِيمَةٍ فَلْيُجِبْ <br>\
                  وَاـِلَّا فَلْيُصَلِّ [i. e. <i>Whoso is invited to a banquet,</i> or <i>a marriage-feast, let him comply, or, if not, let him pray</i> for the inviter]. (M.) And the saying, in a verse of El-Aashà, عَلَيْكِ مِثْلَ الَّذِى صَلَّيْتِ means <i>Keep thou to the like of thy prayer;</i> i. e. he enjoined her to repeat the prayer for him: or, as some relate it, عَلَيْكِ مِثْلُ الَّذِى صَلَّيْتِ, meaning <i>upon thee be the like of that for which thou hast prayed:</i> (M:) these words he addressed to his daughter, on the occasion of her saying, “ O my Lord, ward off from my father diseases and pain. ” (Mgh.) The saying عَبِيدُ فُلَانٍ يُصَلُّونَ [<i>The slaves of such a one perform the divinely-appointed act of prayer</i>] means that they have attained to the age of virility. (Mgh.) ―         -b2-  صلّى عَلَيْهِ, said of an angel, means <i>He prayed for,</i> or <i>begged, forgiveness,</i> or <i>pardon, for him:</i> and thus the verb sometimes means when said of other than an angel; as in the trad. of Sowdeh, in which it is said, اـِذَا مِتْنَا صَلَّى لَنَا عُثْمَانُ بْنُ مَظْعُونٍ [<i>When we die, &#39;Othmán Ibn-Madh&#39;oon will pray for forgiveness for us</i>]; he having then died. (TA.) ―         -b3-  [And, said of a man, <i>He blessed him,</i> meaning <i>he invoked</i> God&#39;s <i>blessing upon him;</i> namely, the Prophet; or he said, اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَيْهِ (expl. by what here follows) accord. to the rendering of صَلُّوا عَلَيْهِ, i. e. عَلَى النَّبِىِّ, by Bd and others in the Kur xxxiii. 56.] One says, صَلَّيْتُ عَلَى النَّبِىِّ [<i>I blessed the Prophet;</i> &amp;amp;c.]. (S.) ―         -b4-  And, said of God, <i>He blessed him,</i> meaning <i>He conferred blessing upon him:</i> and <i>He had mercy on him:</i> and <i>He magnified him,</i> or <i>conferred honour upon him:</i> hence the saying, اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى ا=لِ اَبِى اَوْفَى, meaning <i>O God, bless the family of Aboo-Owfà:</i> or <i>have mercy on</i> &amp;amp;c.: but in the saying [in the Kur xxxiii. 56], اـِنَّ اْللّٰهَ وَمَلَايِكَتَهُ يُصَلُّونَ عَلَى النَّبِىِّ, the verb does not import two meanings; for it has there only one meaning, which is “ magnification ” [i. e. these words mean <i>Verily God and his angels magnify the Prophet;</i> or rather I would render them, <i>bless the Prophet,</i> as this rendering implies magnification and also a meaning of the quasi-inf. n. given in the M and K, which is “ eulogy, ” or “ commendation, ” bestowed by God upon his apostle, while it imports God&#39;s “ conferring of blessing ” and the angels&#39; “ invoking thereof ” ]: (Msb, TA:) [it is said that] اللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ means <i>O God, magnify Mohammad in the present world by exalting his renown and manifesting his invitation</i> [<i>to ElIslám</i>] <i>and rendering permanent his law, and in the world to come by accepting his intercession for his people and multiplying his reward:</i> and it is disputed whether or not this form of prayer may be used for any but the Prophet [Mohammad]: El-Khattábee says that it may not, though he himself used it for others. (TA.) [صَلَّى اْللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ <br>\
                  وَسَلَّمَ is a phrase commonly used by the Muslims after the mention of their prophet: see art. سلم. See also صَلَاةٌ below.]       -A2-  صلّى said of a horse, (S, K,) inf. n. تَصْلِيَةٌ, (TA,) <i>He followed next after the foremost</i> [<i>in a race, at the goal</i>]. (S, K.) Hence the saying [in a trad. of &#39;Alee], سَبَقَ <br>\
                  رَسُولُ اْللّٰهِ وَصَلَّى اَبُو بَكْرٍ وَثَلَّثَ عُمَرُ [expl. in art. سبق]. (Mgh.) ―         -b2-  And صلّى الحِمَارُ اُتُنَهُ, (Sgh, K,) inf. n. تَصْلِيَةٌ, (Sgh, TA,) <i>The</i> [<i>wild</i>] <i>ass drove together his she-asses, and made them to take the way</i> [<i>that he would follow</i>].

                   The <i>middle of the back</i> of a human being and of any quadruped: (M, K:) and, (K,) or as some say, (M,) [app. in a beast,] the <i>part that slopes down from the hips,</i> or <i>haunches:</i> or the <i>space intervening between the</i> <br>\
                  جَاعِرَة [app. meaning the <i>hinder projection of the haunch</i> or <i>rump</i> of a beast] <i>and the tail:</i> (M, K:) or the <i>part on the right and left of the tail;</i> (S, M, K;) the two together being called [the] صَلَوَانِ, (S, K,) which is similarly expl. by Zj in relation to a she-camel; app. properly meaning the <i>two parts bordering upon the tail-bone:</i> (TA:) or the <i>place in which is set the tail</i> of the horse; dual as above: (Msb:) or the <i>bone upon which are the two buttocks:</i> (Mgh: [there thus expl. in relation to a man:]) or the <i>bone in which is the place of setting of the tail-bone;</i> thus expl. by IDrd: or the صَلَوَانِ are the <i>two bones projecting from the two sides of the rump:</i> or, accord. to some of the lexicologists, <i>two veins</i> (عِرْقَانِ) <i>in the place of the</i> <br>\
                  رِدْف [i. e. <i>in the rump</i>]: (Ham p. 46:) the pl. is صَلَوَاتٌ, (M, K,) an instance of a pl. formed by the addition of ا and ت from a masc. sing., (M,) and اَصْلَا=ءٌ. (M, K.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] one says, جِيْتُ فِى اَصْلَايِهِمْ, meaning <i>I came at their rears.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

Arabe, p. 67 of the Arabic text,) but this rule I have not found to be generally observed,  even in the best MSS., nor have I in the similar case of حَيٰوةٌ, (to which it is also applied,) in the best copies of the Kur-án,] is said to be [originally صَلَوَةٌ,] of the measure فَعَلَةٌ, (Mgh, MF, TA,) or, accord. to some, [صَلْوَةٌ,] of the measure فَعْلَةٌ: (MF, TA:) it is a quasi-inf. n. of صَلَّى [q. v.]: (S, K:) and [used as a simple subst.] it signifies <i>Prayer, supplication,</i> or <i>petition:</i> (S, M, Msb, K:) this is said to be its primary signification: and ↓ <br>\
      مُصَلًّى is said to have the same meaning. (Msb, TA.) ―         -b2-  Then applied to signify <i>A certain well-known mode,</i> or <i>manner,</i> [<i>of religious service,</i>] because comprising prayer; (Msb;) [the <i>divinelyappointed act of prayer;</i>] <i>one of the divinelyappointed</i> <br>\

      مُصَلًّى is said to have the same meaning. (TA.) [The performance of this act is fully described in my work on the Modern Egyptians.] It is said to be, in this sense, a proper term of the law, not indicated by the language of the Arabs [before El-Islám] except as importing prayer, which is its primary signification: what Esh-Shiháb says respecting it necessarily implies its being a proper term of the law known to the Arabs [before ElIslám]: in the Mz it is said to be one of the words of El-Islám: but all of these sayings require consideration. (MF, TA, [Much more, which I omit as being unprofitable, is added on this point in the TA, partly from the Msb; as well as several different opinions respecting the derivation of the word as used in this sense, which are fanciful or absurd.]) The saying of the Prophet, لَا صَلٰوةَ <br>\

                  صلوة [or <i>divinely-appointed prayer</i>], or <i>the place thereof,</i> [<i>is before thee,</i>] alluding to that of sunset. (Mgh.) And he used the term الصَّلٰوةُ as meaning سُورَةُ الصَّلٰوةِ, i. e. <i>The</i> <br>\
                  فَاتِحَة [or <i>Opening Chapter of the Kur-án,</i> because it is a form of prayer, or] because the recital thereof is excellent, or satisfactory. (Mgh.) In the Kur xxii. 41, (I&#39; Ab, S, M, Ksh, Bd,) [the pl.] صَلَوَاتٌ means <i>Places of worship of the Jews:</i> (I&#39; Ab, S, M, Ksh, Bd, K:) said to be (Ksh, Bd) originally صَلُوتَا, a Hebrew word, (Ksh, Bd, K,) arabicized: (Ksh, Bd:) this is the common reading of the word, and the most valid: other readings are صُلُوَاتٌ and صُلَوَاتٌ and صِلَوَاتٌ; and beside these, some others which are perverted forms.
