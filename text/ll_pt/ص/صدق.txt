                  , (M, TA,) inf. n. صِدْقٌ (S, * M, O, * Msb, K, TA) and صَدْقٌ, (M, K,) the former of which is the more chaste, (TA,) or the latter is an inf. n. and the former is a simple subst., (K,) and تَصْدَاقٌ (M) and مَصْدُوقَةٌ, (O, K, TA,) which is one of the [few] inf. ns. of the measure مَفْعُولَةٌ, (O, TA,) [or a fem. pass. part. n. used as an inf. n. like as is said of its contr. مَكْذُوبَةٌ,] <i>he spoke, said, uttered,</i> or <i>told, truth,</i> or <i>truly,</i> or <i>veraciously; contr. of</i> <br>\
                  كَذَبَ: (Msb: [and in like manner it is said in the S and M and O and K that صِدْقٌ is the <i>contr. of</i> <br>\
                  كَذِبٌ:]) Er-Rághib says that صِدْقٌ and كَذِبٌ are primarily in what is said, whether relating to the past or to the future, and [in the latter case] whether it be a promise or other than a promise; and only in what is said in the way of information: but sometimes they are in other modes of speech, such as asking a question, and commanding, and supplicating; as when one says, “ Is Zeyd in the house? ” for this implies information of his being ignorant of the state of Zeyd; and when one says, “ Make me to share with thee, or to be equal with thee, ” for this implies his requiring to be made to share with the other, or to be made equal with him; and when one says, “ Do not thou hurt me, ” for this implies that the other is hurting him: صِدْقٌ, he says, is [by implication] the agreeing of what is said with what is conceived in the mind and with the thing told of, together; otherwise it is not complete صِدْق, but may be described either as صِدْق or sometimes as صِدْق and sometimes as كَذِب according to two different points of view; as when one says without believing it, “ Mohammad is the Apostle of God, ” for this may be termed صِدْق because what is told is such, and it may be termed كَذِب because it is at variance with what the speaker conceives in his mind. (TA.) One says, صَدَقَ فِى الحَدِيثِ [<i>He spoke truth in the information,</i> or <i>narration</i>]. (S, O, K.) And صَدَقَهُ i. e. <i>He told him,</i> or <i>informed him, with truth,</i> or <i>veracity,</i> (AHeyth, * M, Msb, *) فِى القَوْلِ [<i>in the saying</i>]; for it is trans. as well as intrans. (Msb.) And صَدَقَهُ <br>\
                  الحَدِيثَ (S, O, K, in the CK [erroneously] صَدَّقَ <br>\
                  فُلانًا الحَدِيثَ) <i>He told him with truth,</i> or <i>veracity, the information,</i> or <i>narration;</i> for it is sometimes doubly trans. (TA.) And صَدَقَنِى سِنَّ بَكْرِهِ [<i>He hath told me truly the age,</i> or <i>as to the age, of his youthful camel;</i> or صَدَقَنِى سِنُّ بَكْرِهِ <br>\
                  <i>the age of his youthful camel has spoken truly to me</i>]: (S, O, K:) a prov., (S, O,) expl. in art. بكر [q. v.]. (K.) And فُلَانٌ لَا يَصْدُقُ اَثَرُهُ and اَثَرَهُ, meaning <i>Such a one,</i> when asked, <i>will not tell truly whence he comes.</i> (M.) And صَدَقَتْ يَمِينُهُ <br>\
                  <i>His oath was,</i> or <i>proved, true.</i> (Msb in art. بت.) صَدَقْتُ اْللّٰهَ <br>\
                  حَدِيثًا اـِنْ لَمْ اَفْعَلْ كَذَا is an oath of the Arabs, meaning لَا صَدَقْتُ الخ [<i>May I not utter truly to God a saying,</i> i. e. <i>may I not speak truth to God, if I do not such a thing</i>]. (AHeyth, O, K.) One says also, صَدَقَهُ النَّصِيحَةَ, and الاـِخَا=ءَ, <i>He rendered to him truly,</i> or <i>sincerely, good advice,</i> and <i>brotherly affection.</i> (M.) And صَدَ قُوهُمُ القِتَالَ (S, M, K, * TA) [<i>They gave them battle earnestly,</i> <br>\
                  <i>not with a false show of bravery;</i> as is implied in the S, and M, and K; i. e.] <i>they advanced against them boldly in fight:</i> (M, TA:) and in like manner, صَدَقُوا فِى القِتَالِ <br>\
                  <i>they advanced boldly in fight:</i> or, accord. to Er-Rághib, the former means <i>they gave them battle so as to fulfil their duty:</i> and hence, in the Kur [xxxiii. 23], رِجَالٌ صَدَقُوا مَا عَاهَدُوا اْللّٰهَ عَلَيْهِ, <i>Men who fulfilled the covenant that they had made with God.</i> (TA.) And صَدَقَ اللِّقَا=ءَ, inf. n. صِدْقٌ, <i>He was firm,</i> or <i>steady, in encounter,</i> or <i>conflict.</i> (M, TA.) And صَدَقَ ظَنِّى <br>\
                  <i>My opinion was,</i> or <i>proved, true,</i> or <i>correct,</i> like as one says [in the contrary case], كَذَبَ: (Er-Rághib, TA:) whence, in the Kur [xxxiv. 19], وَلَقَدْ صَدَقَ عَلَيْهِمْ اـِبْلِيسُ ظَنَّهُ, meaning فِى ظَنِّهِ [i. e. <i>And assuredly Iblees was,</i> or <i>proved to be, correct in his opinion</i> that he had formed <i>against them</i>]: but some read ↓ <br>\
      صَدَّقَ, meaning, as Fr says, حَقَّقَ [i. e. Iblees <i>proved,</i> or <i>found, to be true,</i> his opinion &amp;amp;c.]. (TA.) And صَدَقَتْهُ نَفْسُهُ <br>\
                  <i>His soul</i> [<i>told him truth;</i> meaning,] <i>diverted him,</i> or <i>hindered him,</i> or <i>held him back, from an undertaking, causing him to imagine himself unable to prosecute it.</i> (TA in art. كذب.) And صَدَقَ الصُّبْحُ [<i>The dawn shone clearly</i>]. (S in art. سقط.)

(T in art. اَمن.) <i>He held him to be a speaker of truth.</i> (MA.) [<i>He found him to be a speaker of truth.

(S in art. خبر.) See 1, near the end. In the saying in the Kur [xxxix. 34], وَاْلَّذِى جَا=ءَ بِالصِّدْقِ <br>\
                  وَصَدَّقَ بِهِ, [which seems to be best rendered <i>But he who hath brought the truth and</i> he who <i>hath accepted it as the truth,</i> (see كَذَّبَ بِالاَمْرِ,)] &#39;Alee the son of Aboo-Tálib is related to have said that by الذى جا=ء بالصدق is meant Mohammad; and by الذى صدّق به, Aboo-Bekr: or, as some say, Gabriel and Mohammad [are meant by the former and the latter respectively]: or by the former, Mohammad; and by the latter, [every one of] the believers: (M:) accord. to Er-Rághib, by وصدّق به is meant <i>and hath found,</i> or <i>proved, to be true</i> (حَقَّقَ) <i>that which he hath brought by word,</i> by that which he hath aimed at (بِمَا تَحَرَّاهُ) by deed.

      صَدَّقَ signifies the same; (M, TA;) and in this sense صدّق is [said by some to be] used in the Kur lxxv. 31. (TA.)
