      صِيصَةٌ, (K,) thus in all the copies of the K, but it is a mistake, or a contracted form, (TA,) <i>The weaver&#39;s</i> [<i>implement called</i>] شَوْكَة, <i>with which he makes the warp and the woof even:</i> (S, IB, K:) but IB says that its last radical letter is ى, not ص; so that it should be mentioned among the class of infirm words: (TA;) pl. صَيَاصٍ. (S.) ―         -b2-  Hence, (S,) The <i>spur</i> of the cock. (S, K.) ―         -b3-  [Hence also,] The <i>horn</i> of the bull or cow, and of the gazelle: (K:) pl. as above, (TA,) signifying the <i>horns</i> of bulls or cows; which were sometimes fixed upon spears, instead of the iron heads: (S:) and to such horns, called by this name, conflict and faction, or sedition, (فِتْنَة,) is likened in a trad., because of its grievousness: some say that the sing. is صِيصَةٌ, [as in the K,] contracted. (TA.) ―         -b4-  And hence, (TA,) <i>A wooden pin,</i> or <i>peg, with which dates are plucked out</i> [<i>when they are compacted in a mass, closely adhering together, in the receptacle of woven palm-leaves,</i> or <i>the like, in which they are packed</i>]: (K:) likened to the horn of a bull or cow: in this sense, the word is written صِيصَةٌ: and a certain poet changes it to صِيصَجّ. (TA.) ―         -b5-  [Hence also,] <i>Anything with which one defends himself:</i> pl. as above, (K,) [in the CK erroneously written صَيَاصِى, as though it had the article ال prefixed to it, or were itself prefixed to another noun, for otherwise it is written and pronounced] with the [final] ى elided. (TA.) ―         -b6-  [Hence also,] <i>A fortress:</i> (K:) pl. in this sense as above. (S, TA.) ―         -b7-  [Hence also,] <i>A pastor who manages</i> [<i>and protects</i>] <i>well his herds</i> or <i>flocks:</i> (AA, K:) in this sense also written صِيصَةٌ.
