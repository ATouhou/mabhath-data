                  ضَرْبَ الاَصَمِّ (tropical:)  <i>He beat him</i> [<i>with the beating of the deaf,</i> meaning,] <i>uninterruptedly and excessively;</i> because the deaf, when he does thus, [not hearing any cry,] imagines that he is falling short of what he should do, and therefore will not leave off.

(M, TA.) صَمَّا=ءُ is applied to a قَطَاة [or bird of the species termed قَطًا, and may in this case be rendered (assumed tropical:)  <i>Small-eared,</i> or <i>dull-eared,</i> being applied thereto] because of the سَكَك [i. e. smallness &amp;amp;c.] of its ear or because it is deaf when thirsting. (M.) And الاَصَمُّ [as though meaning (tropical:)  <i>The deafmute</i>] is an epithet applied to رَجَب, (S, M, Msb, K,) the month thus named, (Msb,) which the people of the Time of Ignorance called شَهْرُ اْللّٰهِ <br>\
                  الاَصَمُّ, (Kh, S,) because the cry of the caller for aid was not heard in it, (Kh, S, M, Msb, K, *) shouting يَا لَفُلَانٍ and يَا صَبَاحَاهْ, (M, K,) nor the commotion of fight, (Kh, S, Msb,) nor the clash of arms, it being one of the sacred months: (Kh, S:) thus applied it is tropical, like نَايِمٌ in the phrase لَيْلٌ نَايِمٌ; as though, in it, the man were deaf to the sound of arms: (TA:) and in like manner it is also called مُنْصِلُ الاَلِّ.
