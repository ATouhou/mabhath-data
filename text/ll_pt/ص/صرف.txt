In the phrase قَدْ شَحَطَتْ صَرْفُ نَوَاهَا, in a verse of Sakhr-el-Ghei, [ISd says,] he has made it fem. because of its dependance upon النَّوَى [which is fem.; as though the meaning were <i>The afflictions that are the consequence of the course taken by her in her journey have exceeded the bounds of moderation</i>]: (M:) [or it is here made fem. because having the signification of a broken pl., which is fem.:] or the meaning is, قَدْ بَعُدَتْ <br>\
