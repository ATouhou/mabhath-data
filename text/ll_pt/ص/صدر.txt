(Kull p. 327.) The مصدر has the same government as its own verb: it is often, and may be at pleasure, used as an ideal subst. or abstract noun: and it is often employed in the place of an act. or a pass. part. n.: (Kull, &amp;amp;c.:) [when thus used as an epithet, it is employed alike as sing. and pl. and masc. and fem.:] accord. to Zj, every مصدر used as an epithet is for ذُو [or ذَات &amp;amp;c.] followed by the مصدر, and therefore it has no dual nor pl. [nor fem.] form. (TA voce حَرَضٌ.) [It has also other uses, which are expl. in the grammars. Used as a مَصْدَر, it is sometimes made fem.; as it is also when used in the sense of a noun that is properly fem.: see صَرْفٌ, third sentence.] ―         -b4-  اِسْمُ مَصْدَرٍ, called by some اِسْمٌ لِلْمَصْدَرِ, is a term applied to [(assumed tropical:)  <i>A quasi-infinitive noun;</i> i. e.] <i>a noun which is not a</i> <br>\
                  مصدر, <i>but which is occasionally used in the place of a</i> <br>\
                  مصدر; like as a مصدر is used in the place of an act. part. n., and in that of a pass. part. n.: such as الوُضُوْءُ for التَّوَضُّوُ [“ the performing of the ablution preparatory to prayer ”], and الغُسْلُ for الاِغْتِسَالُ [“ the washing of oneself ”]; each of which wants somewhat that is in its verb without substituting anything for that which is wanting. (Expos. of the “ Kitáb el- Hodood, ” cited above.) This kind of noun the grammarians of El-Koofeh and Baghdád allow to govern as a مصدر; but the grammarians of ElBasrah hold that the noun governed in the accus. case in each of the exs. adduced by the former as confirmatory of their opinion is so governed by a verb understood. (Expos. of the “ Shudhoor, ” ubi suprà.) It is also applied to <i>A proper name signifying an accident</i> [or <i>attribute</i>]; as فَجَارِ and حَمَادِ, proper names, by original application, for الفَجْرَةُ and المَحْمَدَةُ [“ vice ” and “ praise ”] and the like: and this kind does not govern as a مصدر. (Expos. of the “ Kitáb Hodood enNahw, ” ubi suprà; and Expos. of the “ Shudhoor, ” ubi suprà.) It is also applied to [what is more properly termed اِسْمٌ لِلْمَعْنَى الحَاصِلِ بِالمَصْدَرِ, by some termed simply حَاصِلٌ بِالمَصْدَرِ, i. e. <i>An ideal substantive,</i> or <i>abstract noun;</i>] <i>a noun applied to signify an accident</i> [or <i>attribute</i>] <i>considered abstractedly</i> [such as صَدَرٌ signifying “ return; ” and this kind is commonly termed in the lexicons simply an اِسْم as distinguished from a مصدر]. (Kull p. 327.) Some apply it also to what is [properly] termed مَصْدَرٌ مِيمِىٌّ [i. e. <i>A</i> <br>\

                  <i>commencing with an augmentative</i> <br>\
                  م], if not of the measure مُفَاعَلَةٌ: but such is really a مَصْدَر. (Expos. of the “ Shudhoor, ” ubi suprà.)
