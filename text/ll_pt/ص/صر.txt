      صَارُورٌ, (M,) or صَرُورَةٌ, (Lh, S, M, A, Msb,) as occurring in the poetry of En-Nábighah, (Yaakoob, S,) not used without ة, (Lh, M,) or all the sing. forms above mentioned, (K,) signify one <i>who has not married:</i> (M, A, K:) or <i>who has not had intercourse with women:</i> as though he had determined (اَصَرَّ) upon relinquishing them: (Yaakoob, S, Msb: *) applied in like manner to a woman, and to a plurality of persons: (M, K:) the ة in صَرُورَةٌ applied to a man and to a woman is not to denote the fem. gender, but to give the utmost intensiveness to the signification. (IJ, M.) ―         -b2-  It is said in a trad., لَا صَرُورَةَ فِى الاـِسْلَامِ, (S, M,) meaning, accord. to A &#39;Obeyd, <i>There is no abstinence from intercourse with women in El-Islám:</i> (M, TA:) i. e., no one should say, I will not marry: (TA:) thus he makes صرورة a noun signifying an accident: but it is better known as an epithet: (M:) and IAth says that the meaning is, he who slays another in the حَرَم [or sacred territory of Mekkeh] shall be slain: his saying, “ I am a صرورة; I have not performed the pilgrimage, and I know not the sacredness of the حَرَم; ” shall not be accepted of him: for in the Time of Ignorance, the Kaabeh was a place of refuge.
