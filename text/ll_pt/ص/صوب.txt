                  </quote> he explains صِيبَ as being like قُصِدَ, and says that it may be of the dial. of him who says صَابَ السَّهْمُ; but [ISd remarks,] I know not how this is, for صَابَ السَّهْمُ is not trans.; [though, as shown above, he has mentioned it as being trans.;] and in my opinion, [he says,] صيب here is from the phrase صَابَتِ السَّمَا=ءُ الاَرْضَ [expl. above; the meaning of the verse being, <i>But how should the censuring women hope for my constraining myself to behave with hardiness, and for my being patient, when the beloved of the soul has been smitten</i> by death, or by the decree of death; for ISd adds,] كَاَنَّ المَنِيَّةَ صَابَتِ الحَمِيمَ فَاَصَابَتْهُ <br>\

(M, TA. *) ―         -b4-  [اصاب is also used in many phrases in which its agent is likened to an archer.] One says, اصاب الصَّوَابَ (tropical:)  [<i>He hit the right thing</i> or <i>point,</i> or <i>the object,</i> or <i>aim, of his words</i> or <i>of his actions</i>]: (A:) and اصاب السَّدَادَ [which means the same]. (S in art. سد.) And اصاب alone [means thus likewise; or] (assumed tropical:)  <i>he said,</i> or <i>did, that which was right.</i> (M, K. *) And اصاب فِى قَوْلِهِ وَفِعْلِهِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He hit the right thing in his saying and his deed;</i> (Msb;) and so فِى رَاْيِهِ <br>\

And] (assumed tropical:)  <i>He found it to be right:</i> and (assumed tropical:)  <i>he saw it, considered it,</i> or <i>held it, to be right.</i> (TA. [See also 10.]) And (assumed tropical:)  <i>He aimed at it;</i> (As, TA;) (tropical:)  <i>he desired, wished, willed, intended,</i> or <i>meant, it.</i> (As, M, A, Msb, TA.) One says, اَصَابَ فُلَانٌ <br>\

And اَيْنَ تُصِيبَانِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Whither do ye two desire to go?</i>]; a saying of Ru-beh. (TA.) تَجْرِى بِاَمْرِهِ رُخَا=ءً حَيْثُ اَصَابَ, in the Kur [xxxviii. 35, referring to the wind], has been expl. as meaning (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Running by his command softly,</i> or <i>gently,</i>] <i>whithersoever He desireth.</i> (M, * TA.) And اصاب اْللّٰهُ الَّذِى اَرَادَ, said in a trad., in reply to a question respecting the interpretation of a text, means (assumed tropical:)  <i>God desireth,</i> or <i>meaneth,</i> [thereby,] <i>what He desireth,</i> or <i>meaneth.</i> (TA.) And اصاب اْللّٰهُ بِكَ خَيْرًا means اَرَادَهُ (tropical:)  [i. e. <i>May God intend thee good</i>]. (A.) And اصاب alone (assumed tropical:)  <i>He desired,</i> or <i>intended,</i> or <i>meant, that which was right.</i> (M, K. *) One says also, اصابهُ بِخَيْرٍ (assumed tropical:)  [meaning <i>He did good to him</i>]. (El-Muärrij, TA in art. اسو.) [But] اصابهُ بِكَذَا, (M,) inf. n. اـِصَابَةٌ, (K,) with which are syn. ↓ <br>\
      مُصَابٌ [in  accordance with a usage generally allowable] (S, TA) and ↓ <br>\
      مُصَابَةٌ, (K, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  [generally] means <i>He afflicted him with,</i> or <i>by, such a thing;</i> or <i>gave pain to him thereby.</i> (M, K: * in the latter, only the inf. n. of the verb in this sense; and so in other senses.) [Thus one says, اصابهُ بِشَرٍّ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He afflicted him with evil;</i> or <i>did evil to him:</i> and اصابهُ بِمَكْرُوهٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He afflicted him with,</i> or <i>did to him, an abominable,</i> or <i>an evil, thing</i> or <i>action:</i> and اصابهُ بِقَوْلٍ قَبِيحٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He afflicted him with,</i> or <i>said to him, a foul saying:</i> and اصابهُ بِذَحْلٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He punished him by blood-revenge:</i> and اصابهُ <br>\

God,) or <i>it,</i> (a thing,) <i>affected him with disease;</i> or <i>rendered him diseased:</i> and in many similar cases, the phrase may be well rendered with a verb derived from the noun; like phrases in which “ affecit ” (a Latin equivalent of اصاب) occurs; as in “ honore affecit, ” meaning “ honoravit. ”] El-Hárith Ibn-Khuld El-Makhzoomee says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

(L, TA.) اَصَابَهُمُ الدَّهْرُ بِنُفُوسِهِمْ وَاَمْوَالِهِمْ (assumed tropical:)  means <i>Time,</i> or <i>fate, afflicted them by destruction,</i> or <i>extirpation, among themselves and their cattle,</i> or <i>possessions.</i> (M.) [In the K, الاـِصَابةُ is expl. as signifying الاِحْتِيَاجُ: but the right reading is evidently الاِجْتِيَاحُ, as Ibr D has remarked in the margin of my copy of the TA; so that اصاب signifies (assumed tropical:)  <i>He destroyed,</i> or <i>extirpated;</i> agreeably with an explanation in the sentence next preceding above, from the M.] مَنْ يُرِدِ اْللّٰهُ بِهِ خَيْرًا يُصِبْ مِنْهُ, (assumed tropical:)  occurring in a trad., means <i>Him whom God intendeth good He trieth with afflictions,</i> that He may recompense him for them. (TA.) And one says, مَا كُنْتُ مُصَابًا وَلَقَدْ اُصِبْتُ (assumed tropical:)  [app. meaning <i>I was not affected with weakness of intellect,</i> or <i>madness, and I have become affected therewith:</i> see مُصَابٌ, below].
