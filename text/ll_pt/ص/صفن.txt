                   A horse <i>standing upon three legs and the extremity of the hoof of the fourth leg:</i> (A&#39;Obeyd, *  S, TA:) or <i>standing upon three legs, and turning back the extremity of the fore part of the fourth hoof, that of his fore leg:</i> (M, TA:) or <i>standing upon three legs,</i> and <i>otherwise:</i> thus, says Fr, I have found the Arabs use the word: (TA: [see 1, first sentence:]) pl. صُفُونٌ (M, TA) and صَوَافِنُ and [the pl. of صَافِنَةٌ is] صَافِنَاتٌ. (TA.) صَافِنَاتٌ occurs in the Kur xxxviii. 30. (M, TA.) And in the same, xxii. 37, I&#39;Ab and Ibn-Mes-&#39;ood used to read صَوَافِنَ [instead of صَوَافَّ]; the former explaining it as meaning <i>Having the shank of one fore leg tied up to the arm;</i> for thus is done with the camel when he is slaughtered: the latter, as meaning <i>standing,</i> or <i>standing still.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  And applied to a man, it means صَافٌّ قَدَمَيْهِ [<i>setting his feet evenly, side by side</i>], (A&#39;Obeyd, M, TA, and the like is said in the S and Msb,) <i>standing.</i> (A&#39;Obeyd, Msb, TA.) It is said in a trad., (S, M, Msb, TA,) referring to the Prophet mentioned as praying, (S, M,) قُمْنَا خَلْفَهُ صُفُونًا [app. meaning <i>We stood behind him setting our feet evenly, side by side;</i> for so the context seems to indicate]. (S, M, Msb, K.) [But] in another trad., صَلٰوةُ الصَّافِنِ is said to be forbidden; meaning [<i>The praying</i>] <i>of him who puts his feet close together:</i> or, as some say, <i>of him who turns back his foot</i> [i. e. <i>one of his feet</i>] <i>like as the horse turns his hoof</i> [i. e. <i>one of his hoofs, when standing upon three legs</i>]. (TA.)       -A2-  الصَّافِنُ signifies [<i>The saphena,</i> or <i>crural vein;</i> so in the present day; i. e.] <i>the vein of the</i> <br>\
                  سَاق: (S: [see اَبْهَرُ, and see also النَّسَا:]) or <i>a vein lying deep in the arm</i> (الذِّرَاع) [<i>and</i>] <i>amid the sinews of the</i> [<i>fore</i>] <i>shank of a beast:</i> or the صَافِنَانِ are <i>two veins penetrating into the interior of the two shanks:</i> or <i>two veins in the legs:</i> or <i>two branches</i> [<i>of veins</i>] <i>in the two thighs:</i> and the صافن is [strangely said to be] <i>a vein in the interior of the back bone, extending lengthwise, uniting with the</i> <br>\
