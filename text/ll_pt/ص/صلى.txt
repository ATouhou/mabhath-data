      صَلَّيْتُهُ, inf. n. تَصْلِيَةٌ. (S.) ―         -b2-  And صَلَيْتُ فُلَانًا, (T, TA,) or لِفُلَانٍ, (S, TA,) (tropical:)  <i>I laboured in a case,</i> or <i>an affair, desiring to calumniate,</i> or <i>slander, such a one therein, and to cause him to fall into destruction:</i> (T, S, TA:) or صَلَيْتُهُ and صَلَيْتُ لَهُ both signify <i>I calumniated,</i> or <i>slandered, him, and caused him to fall into destruction,</i> (M, TA,) <i>in consequence thereof:</i> (M:) or, accord. to the K, صَلَى <br>\
                  فُلَانًا, of which the inf. n. is صَلْىٌ, signifies <i>he soothed, coaxed, wheedled,</i> or <i>cajoled, such a one:</i> or <i>deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented,</i> or <i>outwitted, him:</i> which meanings are not in any of the three lexicons above mentioned: accord. to the A, صَلَيْتُ بِفُلَانٍ [probably a mistranscription for لِفُلَانٍ] means (tropical:)  <i>I framed a stratagem,</i> or <i>plot, to cause such a one to fall;</i> there said to be tropical.

      تصلّى: (M, K:) or <i>he felt the heat of the fire:</i> (Msb:) and one says ↓ <br>\

                  بِالنَّارِ means <i>he was tried</i> (بُلِىَ) <i>by fire,</i> or <i>by the fire;</i> and so بِكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  [<i>by such a thing, as though by fire</i>]. (TA.) [In the Kur, in which are many exs. of it, (iv. 11, xiv. 34, xvii. 19, &amp;amp;c.,) it is always trans. by itself, without بِ.] And صَلِىَ بِالاَمْرِ, (S, M, *) and بِالحَرْبِ; (S;) and الاَمْرَ ↓ <br>\

                  الرَّجُلُ signifies also لَزِمَ [i. e. <i>The man kept to,</i> or <i>clave to,</i> a thing]; and so ↓ <br>\
      اصطلى: whence Zj holds صَلَاةٌ [expl. in art. صلو] to be derived; because it is a keeping, or cleaving, to that which God has appointed: and hence also, [it is said,] فِى النَّارِ ↓ <br>\
      مَنْ يُصَلَّى, i. e. يلزم [app. يُلْزَمُ, meaning مَنْ يُلْزَمُ النَّارَ <br>\
                  <i>He who is made to keep,</i> or <i>cleave, to the fire;</i> nearly agreeing with صَلَّاهُ النَّارَ as expl. above from the M and K]. (TA.)       -A4-  And صَلَيْتُ الظَّهْرَ means <i>I struck,</i> or <i>beat, that part of the back which is called</i> <br>\
                  صَلًا: or <i>I hit that part:</i> but this is extr.; for by rule it should be صَلَوْتُهُ, like as Hudheyl say. (M. [See 1 in art. صلو.])    </entryFree> <br>\

      صَلَى, [without teshdeed,] but this is wrong, as is shown by a verse cited in the M, (TA,) <i>He warmed his hand with the fire.</i> (M, K, TA.) [And it is said in the TA that صلا <br>\
                  ظَهْرَهُ بالنهر means اَدْفَاَهُ: but I think that the right reading is صلّى ظَهْرَهُ بِالنَّمِرَةِ, i. e. <i>He warmed his</i> <br>\

      تَصَلَّيْتُ [app. meaning <i>I warmed myself by means of the fire</i>]: (S:) or اصطلى النَّارَ and بِالنَّارِ mean <i>he became warm by means of the fire:</i> and بِالنَّارِ ↓ <br>\
      تصلّى, <i>he became burnt by the fire.</i> (MA.) Hence, in the Kur [xxvii. 7 and xxviii. 29], لَعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ [<i>May-be ye will warm yourselves</i>]: (TA:) in relation to which it is said that the time was winter, and therefore الاِصْطِلَا=ء was needed. (M, TA.) ―         -b2-  It is also said of the chameleon, as meaning <i>He repaired to the sun.</i> (M and L in art. شقذ: see an ex. in a verse cited voce شَقَذَانٌ.) ―         -b3-  And one says of a courageous man, with whom one cannot cope, لَا يُصْطَلَى بِنَارِهِ [lit. <i>One cannot warm himself by means of his fire;</i> meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>one cannot approach him when he is inflamed with rage,</i> especially <i>in fight,</i> or <i>battle</i>]. (S.) The phrase may be also used satirically, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>One will not seek his hospitality.</i> (Meyd. [See Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 588.]) ―         -b4-  See also 1, latter half, in two places.    </entryFree> <br>\
