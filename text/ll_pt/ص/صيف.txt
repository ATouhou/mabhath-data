                  رَبِيع, <i>commencing when the sun enters Aries:</i> but is applied by the vulgar to the قَيْظ, which is the [<i>summer,</i> i. e.] the <i>quarter commencing when the sun enters Cancer:</i> (Msb in art. زمن; q. v.:) [F says,] the صَيْف is the قَيْظ [i. e. <i>summer,</i> or the <i>hot season</i>]; or [the <i>season</i>] <i>after the</i> <br>\
