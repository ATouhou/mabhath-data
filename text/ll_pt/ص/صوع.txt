                  صَاع [q. v.]. (O, K.) One says, هٰذَا طَعَامٌ يُصَاعُ i. e. [<i>This is wheat</i>] <i>that is measured</i> [<i>with the</i> <br>\
                  صاع]. (O.) ―         -b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  [<i>I collected it together,</i> like as the measurer collects the corn &amp;amp;c. in the measure: and the contr., i. e.] <i>I dispersed it,</i> or <i>scattered it;</i> (S, O, K;) in which sense it is [said to be] tropical; (TA;) and صِعْتُهُ, aor. اَصِيعُهُ, (K in art. صيع,) inf. n. صَيْعٌ, (TA in that art.,) signifies the same. (K in that art.) One says, صُعْتُ الاَقْرَانَ, and غَيْرَهُمْ, (tropical:)  <i>I came to the antagonists,</i> and <i>others, from their sides:</i> (K, TA:) of a courageous man, or a courageous armed man, one says, يَصُوعُ اَقْرَانَهُ (tropical:)  <i>He comes to his antagonists from their sides;</i> (S, O, TA;) and the like is cited in the T from Lth; or as meaning <i>he encompasses their sides;</i> (TA;) or <i>he collects together his antagonists</i> (IKtt, Z, TA) <i>from every side,</i> (IKtt, TA,) like as the measurer collects together that which is measured: (Z, TA:) and of a man, (S, O,) or a pastor, (Lth, IKtt, Z,) يَصُوعُ <br>\

      اصاع, inf. n. اـِصَاعَةٌ, signifies thus likewise: (Lh, TA in art. صيع:) Lh also says that صُعْتُ الغَنَمَ, aor. اَصُوعُهَا, inf. n. صَوْعٌ, and صِعْتُهَا, aor. اَصِيعُهَا, inf. n. صَيْعٌ, both signify <i>I dispersed the sheep</i> or <i>goats:</i> (O in art. صيع:) or, accord. to IKtt, صاع اـِبِلَهُ, said of a pastor, has two contr. meanings; <i>he collected together his camels from every side;</i> and also <i>he dispersed his camels.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  Also <i>I frightened him.</i> (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, * O, * K.) ―         -b4-  And صُعْتُ القَوْمَ, aor. اَصُوعُهُمْ, (Lh, O in art. صيع,) inf. n. صَوْعٌ, (TA in that art.,) <i>I urged,</i> or <i>incited, the people,</i> or <i>party;</i> (Lh, O and TA in that art.;) and so صِعْتُ القَوْمَ, (Lh, O and K in that art.,) aor. اَصِيعُهُمْ, (Lh, O ibid.,) inf. n. صَيْعٌ.

      صِوَاعٌ, (O, K,) thus accord. to five different readers of the Kur in xii. 72, (O, K, * TA,) <i>A certain measure used for measuring corn</i> (&amp;amp; c.], (S, O, Msb, K,) <i>and upon which turn</i> [or <i>depend</i>] <i>the decisions of the Muslims</i> [<i>relating to measures of capacity</i>]: (K:) or the صاع is <i>different from the</i> ↓ <br>\
      صُوَاع; (S, K;) the latter being <i>a certain vessel, in</i> [or <i>from</i>] <i>which one drinks</i> [as will be expl. hereafter in this paragraph]: (S, TA:) the former is <i>four</i> <br>\

(of pauc., used by those who make the sing. fem., O, Msb) is اَصْوُعٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) for which one may say اَصْوُعٌ, (S, O, K, *) changing the و into hemzeh, (S, O,) and accord. to AAF some say ا=صُعٌ, like ا=دُرٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) a pl. of دَارٌ, (Mgh,) but AHát says that this is a vulgar mistake, (Msb,) and اَصْوَاعٌ, (O, Msb, K,) which is used by those who make the sing. masc., (O, Msb,) and [of mult.] صُوعٌ, (K,) which is app. pl. of ↓ <br>\
      صِوَاعٌ, with kesr, (TA,) and صِيعَانٌ, (Mgh, O, Msb, K,) which is [likewise] a pl. of mult., (Msb,) or this last is pl. of ↓ <br>\
      صُوَاعٌ: and this sing. signifies <i>a</i> [<i>vessel of the kind called</i>] جَام, [app. here used in the sense which this word commonly has in Pers., i. e. as meaning <i>a cup,</i>] <i>in which,</i> (K, TA,) or <i>from which,</i> (TA,) <i>one drinks:</i> (K, TA:) Sa&#39;eed Ibn-Jubeyr says that the صواع of the king [mentioned in the Kur xii. 72] was the <i>Persian</i> <br>\
                  مَكُّوك, <i>of which the two extremities</i> [<i>are compressed so that they</i>] <i>meet together</i> [app. <i>in such a manner that the whole vessel resembles a small boat,</i> the word مكّوك being expl. in several dictionaries as applied to a drinking-vessel of this form, probably from the Pers. مَكُّوكْ signifying “ a shuttle ” and used in this sense in modern Arabic]: El-Hasan says that <i>the</i> <br>\

                  <i>are one thing,</i> as Zj also says; and that the صواع of the king is said to have been of وَرِق [meaning silver], and that they used to measure with it and sometimes they drank with it: Zj says that it is explained as <i>an oblong vessel, resembling the</i> <br>\
                  مَكُّوك, with which the king used to drink; and said by some to have been of مِسّ [which (as is said in the TA in art. مس) means copper, from the Pers. مِسْ]. (TA.) [See also صَوْغٌ, with غ.] ―         -b2-  صَاعٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  The <i>place</i> [or <i>plot</i>] <i>in which a</i> <br>\
                  صاع [<i>of seed</i>] <i>is sown:</i> so in a trad. (TA.) ―         -b3-  And (tropical:)  <i>A depressed piece of ground;</i> (S, O, K, TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
      صَاعَةٌ; (O, K, TA;) <i>like an excavation:</i> or, as some say, <i>a depressed place, sloping down from its surrounding borders:</i> (TA:) or <i>a narrow, depressed place.</i> (TA in art. طا.) ―         -b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  <i>A place that is swept and in which one then plays:</i> (Ibn-&#39; Abbád, O, K:) [see the verse cited in what follows:] and ↓ <br>\
      صَاعَةٌ is said to signify <i>a piece of ground which a boy sweeps, removing its pebbles, and in which he plays with the ball:</i> and <i>a bare place, in which is nothing.</i> (TA.) ―         -b5-  And The <i>place of the breast of the ostrich when she puts it upon the ground:</i> (K:) or such a place is called صَاعُ جُوْجُوِ النَّعَامِ. (IF, O.) And one says, ضَرَبَهُ فِى صَاعِ جُوُجُوِهِ and فى صاعِ صَدْرِهِ meaning (tropical:)  <i>He struck him in the middle of his breast.</i> (Z, TA.)       -A2-  And it is said that] صَاعٌ also signifies The [<i>kind of goffstick called</i>] صَوْلَجَان.
