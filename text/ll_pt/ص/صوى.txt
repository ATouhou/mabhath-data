                  <i>The udder had no milk remaining in it.</i> (Ham p. 661.) ―         -b2-  [Hence,] صَوَتِ <br>\

                  <i>The ewe,</i> or <i>she-goat, became fat,</i> (S, TA,) <i>in consequence of her udder&#39;s having been made to dry up.</i> (S.) And صَوِىَ <br>\

                  , (M,) inf. n. تَصْوِيَةٌ, (K,) primarily, (M,) is used in relation to females, meaning <i>He abstained from milking</i> her, <i>in order that she might become fat,</i> (M, K,) <i>and not be weak.</i> (M.) You say, صَوَّيْتُ النَّاقَةَ <br>\
                  <i>I abstained from milking the she-camel for some days in order that the milk might collect in her udder so that she might become fat:</i> or <i>I made her milk to dry up, that she might become fatter.</i> (M.) And صَوَّيْتُ الشَّاةَ, inf. n. as above, <i>I made the udder of the ewe,</i> or <i>goat, to become dry, that she might become fatter:</i> (S:) or صوّيت الغَنَمَ <br>\
                  <i>I made the milk of the ewes,</i> or <i>goats, to dry up, purposely, that they might become fatter;</i> like as one says in relation to camels: the subst. from the verb thus used is ↓ <br>\
      صَوًى; and this is said to mean The <i>leaving an animal and not milking her.</i> (M.) Some say that تَصْوِيَةٌ is like تَصْرِيَةٌ; and hence the trad., التَّصْوِيَةُ خِلَابَةٌ [i. e. <i>The causing the milk to collect in the udder</i> of an animal <i>by abstaining from milking</i> her <i>for some days,</i> when one desires to sell her, <i>is an endeavouring to deceive:</i> but I think that the right reading in this instance is probably التَّصْرِيَةُ, with ر]. (TA.) ―         -b2-  It is also used in relation to a stallion (S, M, K) of the camels: (S:) thus it is used by El-Fak&#39;asee. (M.) One says, صَوَّيْتُ الفَحْلَ, (M,) inf. n. as above, (S, K,) <i>I put no burden upon the stallion</i> [<i>camel</i>], <i>and did not bind him with a rope, in order that he might become more brisk in covering, and more strong;</i> (S, * M, K; *) thus expl. by El-&#39;Adebbes El-Kinánee: (S:) or <i>I exempted him from work, and fed him, until his spirit returned to him, and he became fat.</i> (M.) And صَوَّيْتُ لِاـِبِلِى فَحْلًا <br>\
                  <i>I chose for my camels a stallion, and fed and nourished him for the office of the stallion.</i> (S.)       -A2-  See also 1.       -A3-  [And see art. صو.]    </entryFree> <br>\
