                  تلعة, <i>lower than it; and which is fertile in plants,</i> or <i>herbage:</i> (L, TA:) or <i>a water-course from the higher part of the ground to the bottom of a valley:</i> (AA, S:) pl. تِلَاعٌ (AA, S, Msb, K) and تَلَعَاتٌ: (K:) and, (K,) or, accord. to Sh, (TA,) تِلَاعٌ signifies <i>water-course flowing from acclivities and the</i> [<i>eminences termed</i>] نِجَاف <br>\
                  <i>and the mountains, until they pour into the valley:</i> (Sh, K:) to which Sh adds, <i>the</i> <br>\

                  <i>comes from a distance of five leagues</i> (فَرَاسِخ) <i>to the valley; and when it flows from the mountains, and falls into the</i> <br>\
                  صحارى [or <i>deserts</i>], <i>it excavates in them what resembles a moat: when it becomes so large as to be like the half, or two thirds, of the valley, it is termed</i> <br>\
                  مَيْثَا=ءُ: (Sh, TA:) تَلْعَةٌ is also said to be like رحبة [i. e. رَحَبَةٌ or رَحْبَةٌ, app. as meaning the <i>part</i> of a valley <i>in which its water flows into it from its two sides</i>]; and the pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.] is said to be تَلْعٌ. (TA.) It is said in a trad., فَيَجِىْءُ مَطَرٌ لَا يَمْتَنِعُ <br>\
                  مِنْهُ ذَنَبُ تَلْعَةٍ [<i>And a rain will come, in consequence of which the end of a water-course will not be impeded</i>]: meaning to denote its abundance, and that no place will be exempt from it. (TA.) And in a prov., فُلَانٌ لَا يَمْنَعُ ذَنَبَ تَلْعَةٍ [<i>Such a one will not impede the end of a water-course</i>]: (K, * TA:) applied to the abject and contemptible. (K.) And in another, (ISh,) لَا اَثِقُ بِسَيْلِ تَلْعَتكَ [<i>I do not,</i> or <i>will not, trust in the flow of thy water-course</i>]: applied to him in whom one does not trust: (ISh, K:) i. e. I do not, or will not, trust in what thou sayest, and what thou adducest: characterizing the person as a liar. (ISh.) And in another, (IAar,) مَا اَخَافُ اـِلَّا مِنْ سَيْلِ تَلْعَتِى [<i>I fear not save from the flow of my water-course</i>]: i. e., from the sons of my uncle, and my relations: (IAar, K:) for he who descends the water-course is in danger: if the torrent come, it sweeps him away.
