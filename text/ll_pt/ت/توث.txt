                  قِرْصَادٌ; a dial. var. of تُوتٌ, [q. v.,] mentioned by IF, (L, K,) and by AHn, who cites a verse in which it occurs, and says that he had not heard any one pronounce it with ت, but only with ث, though توث is Persian and توت is Arabic; (IB, TA;) but it is disallowed by El- Hareeree and others: (TA:) in the Expos. of the work entitled Adab el-Kátib, it is said that توت is an arabicized word, originally توث and توذ: (Mz, MF:) the n. un. is with ة.
