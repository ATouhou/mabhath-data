(TA.) تَرِبَتْ جَبِينُهُ [<i>May his forehead</i> (for so جبين here means, as it does in some other instances,) <i>cleave to the dust,</i> or <i>earth,</i>] was said by Mohammad in reproving a man, and is said to mean a prayer that the man might be frequent in prostrating himself in prayer. (TA from a trad.) And he said to one of his companions, تَرِبَتْ نَحْرُكَ [<i>May the uppermost part of thy breast cleave to the dust,</i> or <i>earth</i>], and the man was [afterwards] slain a martyr: therefore this is to be understood in its obvious sense.

      تَرْيَبٌ, which is perhaps a dial. var., and accord. to some ↓ <br>\
      تِرْيِبٌ, and ↓ <br>\
      تَرْيَابٌ, (TA,) signify the same, (Lth, T, S, M, A, K,) and are words of which the meaning is well known: (A, K:) [i. e. <i>Dust:</i> and <i>earth:</i> generally the former; i. e. <i>fine, dry, particles of earth;</i> as when we say, الرِّيحُ تَسُوقُ التُّرَابَ <br>\
                  <i>The wind drives along the dust:</i> but we also use the expression تُرَابٌ نَدٍ, meaning <i>moist earth,</i> the explanation, in Lexicons, of the word ثَرًى:] ؟ثَرًى is تُرَابٌ; and when it ceases to be moist, it is still تراب, but is not then called ثرى: (Msb voce ثرى:) accord. to Fr, تُرَابٌ is a gen. n., from which is formed neither dual nor pl.: and its rel. n. is ↓ <br>\
      تُرَابِىٌّ: (TA:) [but when it means <i>a kind of dust</i> or <i>earth,</i> as ↓ <br>\
      تُرْبَةٌ also does sometimes, it has a pl.: in this case,] accord. to Lh, (M,) its pl. is اَتْرِبَةٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and تِرْبَانٌ [a pl. of mult.]; (S, M, K) and some add تُرْبَانٌ: (TA:) [and when ↓ <br>\
      تُرْبَةٌ has this, or a similar, meaning, it has for its pl. تُرَبٌ; as in the phrase اَطْيَبُ التُّرَبِ <br>\
                  <i>the best of the kinds of earth,</i> occurring in this art. in the A:] but no pl. of any of the other syn. words mentioned above has been heard: (M, K:) AAF says that تراب is the pl. of ترب; [app. meaning that تُرَابٌ is a quasi-pl. n. (which is often called in lexicons a pl.) of تُرْبٌ;] but MF observes that this requires consideration: (TA:) Lth says that ↓ <br>\
      تُرْبٌ and تُرَابٌ are syn.; but when the fem. forms of these words are used, they say, ↓ <br>\
      اَرْضٌ طَيّبَةُ التُّرْبَة meaning <i>Land that is good in respect of the natural constitution of its dust</i> or <i>earth;</i> and ↓ <br>\
      تُرَابَةٌ when meaning <i>A layer,</i> or <i>lamina, of dust</i> or <i>earth, such as is not perceived by the sight, but only by the imagination:</i> (T:) or this last word and ↓ <br>\
      تُرْبَةٌ signify <i>a portion of dust</i> or <i>earth:</i> and الاَرْضِ ↓ <br>\
      تُرْبَةُ signifies <i>the exterior,</i> or <i>external part, of the earth:</i> (M:) and ↓ <br>\
      التَّرْبَا=ءُ, <i>the earth</i> (S, K) <i>itself.</i> (S.) The Arabs said, التُّرَابُ لَكَ [<i>Dust,</i> or <i>earth, be thy lot</i>]; using the nom. case, although meaning an imprecation, because the word is a simple subst., not an inf. n.: but Lh mentions the phrase التُّرَابَ لِلْاَبْعَدِ [<i>Dust,</i> or <i>earth, be the lot of the remote from good</i>]; saying that the accus. case is used, as though the phrase were an imprecation [of the ordinary kind, in which an inf. n. is used in the accus. case as the absolute complement of its own verb understood]. (M.) And لَهُ التُّرَابُ is a phrase used as meaning (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He has,</i> or <i>shall have,</i> or <i>may he have,</i>] <i>disappointment,</i> (Msb in art. عهر,) or, <i>nothing.</i> (A &#39;Obeyd, Mgh in art. فرش.) لَهُ وَجَنْدَلًا ↓ <br>\
      تُرْبًا is also a form of imprecation, in which substs. in the proper sense of the term are used in the manner of inf. ns., put in the accus. case by reason of a verb unexpressed; as though it were for تَرِبَتْ يَدَاهُ وَجُنْدِلَتْ [<i>May his arms,</i> or <i>his hands, cleave to the dust,</i> or <i>earth, and the stones,</i> by reason of poverty]: and some of the Arabs put the nouns in the nom. case, still using the phrase in the same sense, as though they were in the accus. (M.) One says also, ↓ <br>\
      بِفِيهِ التَّوْرَبُ and ↓ <br>\
      التَّيْرَبُ and ↓ <br>\
      التِّيِرَبُ and ↓ <br>\
      التَّرْبَا=ءُ and ↓ <br>\
      التَّوْرَابُ [<i>In his mouth is dust,</i> or <i>earth:</i> or <i>may dust,</i> or <i>earth, be in his mouth;</i> i. e. may he die, or be in his grave]. (T.) It is said in a trad. that God created the ↓ <br>\
      تُرْبَة [meaning the <i>dust,</i> or <i>soil,</i> or, accord. to the TA the <i>earth</i> (اَرْض),] on the seventh day of the week; and created upon it the mountains on the first day; and the trees, on the second day. (T.) And one says, ↓ <br>\
      لَاَضْرِبَنَّهُ حَتَّى يَعَضَّ بِالتَّرْبَا=ءِ, (Lth, T, A,) meaning [<i>I will assuredly beat him so that he shall bite</i>] <i>the dust,</i> or <i>earth.</i> (Lth, T.) And ↓ <br>\
      بَيْنَهُمَا مَا بَيْنَ الجَرْبَا=ءِ وَالتَّرْبَا=ءِ, meaning [<i>Between them two is the space that is between</i>] <i>the heaven and the earth.</i> (A.)    </entryFree> <br>\
