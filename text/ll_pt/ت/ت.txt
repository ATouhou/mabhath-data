                  <i>The third letter of the alphabet:</i> called تَا=ءٌ and تَا [respecting which latter see the letter ب]: the pl. [of the former is تَا=ءَاتٌ; and of the latter,] اَتْوَا=ءُ. (TA in باب الالف الليِنّة.) It is one of the letters termed مَهْمُوسَة [or non-vocal, i. e. pronounced with the breath only, without the voice], and of those termed نِطَعِيَّة [and نِطْعِيَّة and نَطَعِيَّة and نَطْعِيَّة pronounced by pressing the tip of the tongue against the upper gums and suddenly withdrawing it with an emission of the breath]: these latter are ط and د and ت, three letters that are among those which are changed into other letters. (TA at the commencement of باب التا=ء.)       -A2-  It is one of the augmentative letters: (S:) and is movent when added at the beginning of a noun, and at the end of a noun, [and at the beginning of a verb,] and at the end of a verb, and is also quiescent at the end of a verb. (Mughnee, K.)       -A3-  Added at the beginning of a noun, it is a preposition, or particle governing the gen. case, significant of swearing, (S, * Mughnee, K,) and denoting wonder; (Mughnee, K;) and [accord. to general usage] it is peculiarly prefixed to the name اللّٰه; (S, Mughnee, K;) as in تَاْللّٰهِ لَقَدْ كَانَ <br>\
                  كَذَا [<i>By God, verily it was thus,</i> or <i>verily such a thing was</i>]; (S;) and تَاْللّٰهِ لَاَفْعَلَنَّ كَذَا [<i>By God, I will assuredly do such a thing</i>]: (TA:) but sometimes they said, تَرَبِّى [<i>By my Lord</i>], and تَرَبِّ الكَعْبَةِ [<i>By the Lord of the Kaabeh</i>], and تَاْلرَّحْمَانِ [<i>By the Compassionate</i>], (Mughnee, K,) as is related on the authority of Akh; deviating from common usage. (TA.) Thus used, it is a substitute for و, (S, Mughnee,) as it is also in تَتْرَى and تُرَاثٌ and تُجَاهَ and تُخَمَةٌ [&amp;amp;c.]; (S;) and the و is a substitute for ب; (S, Mughnee;) but the ت has the additional meaning of denoting wonder: so says Z. (Mughnee.)       -A4-  Added at the end of a noun, it is a particle of allocution: (Mughnee, K:) it is thus added in اَنْتَ [<i>Thou</i>], (S, Mughnee, K,) addressed to a male, (TA,) and اَنْتِ [<i>Thou</i>], (Mughnee, K,) addressed to a female; (TA;) uniting with the noun, as though the two became one; not being an affixed noun governed in the gen. case. (S. [See اَنْ.])       -A5-  It is added in [the beginning of] the second person of the future, (S,) [i. e.,] in the beginning of the aor., (TA,) [as a particle of allocution,] as in اَنْتَ تَفْعَلُ [<i>Thou dost,</i> or <i>wilt do</i>]. (S, TA.) ―         -b2-  It is also added, as a sign of the fem. gender, in the beginning of the future, [or aor.,] as in هِىَ تَفْعَلُ [<i>She does,</i> or <i>will do</i>]. (S, TA.) ―         -b3-  It is also added in the beginning of the third person [fem.] of the [aor. used as an] imperative, [as a sign of the fem. gender,] as in لِتَقُمْ هِنْدُ [<i>Let Hind stand</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b4-  And sometimes it is added in the beginning of the second person of the [aor. used as an] imperative, [as a particle of allocution,] as in the phrase in the Kur [x. 59, accord. to one reading], فَبِذٰلِكَ فَلْتَفْرَحُوا [<i>Therefore therein rejoice ye</i>]: and in the saying of the rájiz, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        تِيْذَنْ فَاـِنِّى حَمْوُهَا وَجَارُهَا <br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        قُلْتُ لِبَوَّابٍ لَدَيْهِ دَارُهَا<br>\
                  </quote> [explained in art.اذن]: and [thus] it is added in the beginning of [the second person of] the [aor. used as an] imperative of a verb of which the agent is not named, as in لِتُزْهَ يَا رَجُلُ [<i>Be thou proud, vain, boastful,</i> or <i>self-conceited, O man</i>], from زُهِىَ: but Akh says that the adding of the ل in the beginning of the second person of the [aor. used as an] imperative [except in the case of a pass. verb or a verb of which the agent is not named] is a bad idiom, because the ل is not needed. (S, TA.)       -A6-  The movent ت added at the end of a verb is a pronoun, as in قُمْتُ [<i>I stood</i>], (Mughnee, K,) and قُمْتَ [<i>Thou stoodest,</i> addressed to a male], and قُمْتِ [<i>Thou stoodest, addressed to a female</i>]: (Mughnee:) thus added in the first and second persons of the pret., it is a pronoun denoting the agent. (S.) ―         -b2-  The quiescent ت added at the end of a verb is a sign of the fem. gender, (Mughnee, K,) i. e., a particle applied to denote the fem. gender, (Mughnee,) as in قَامَتْ [<i>She stood</i>]. (Mughnee, K.) J says [in the S] that, when thus added at the end of the pret., it is a pronoun: but IB says [correctly] that it is a particle. (TA.)       -A7-  It is also, sometimes, affixed to ثُمَّ and رُبَّ; and in these cases it is most commonly movent with fet-h, (Mughnee, K,) so that one says ثُمَّتَ and رُبَّتَ. (TA.) [See arts. ثم and رب.]       -A8-  تِ is an imperative of اَتَى. (M in art. اتى.)       -A9-  [As a numeral, ت denotes <i>Four hundred.</i>]   </entryFree> <br>\
