                   (ISk, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and تُوثٌ; (Mgh, and L and K in art. توث, q. v.;) the latter sometimes used; (Msb;) or this is not allowable; (ISk, T, S, Msb;) for the word, which is app. Persian, is pronounced by the Arabs with ت for the final as well as for the initial letter; (T, Msb;) [The <i>mulberry;</i> and especially the <i>white mulberry;</i>] <i>i. q.</i> <br>\
                  فِرْصَادٌ: (ISk, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K:) or, accord. to the people of El-Basrah, (Msb,) or some of the people of El-Basrah, (Mgh,) توت is the name of the <i>fruit,</i> and فرصاد is that of the <i>tree;</i> (Mgh, Msb;) and this is what is commonly held: (Msb:) or, accord. to IDrd and others, توت is an arabicized word, and فرصاد is the Arabic name: (TA:) [توت is a coll. gen. n.:] the n. un. is with ة. (M.) [Golius says, in his Lex., on the authority of Zeyn El-&#39; Attár, that there are three kinds: “ توت حلو, ” i. e. حُلْوٌ, “ the <i>sweet and white mulberry,</i> peculiarly called فرصاد; and توت حامض, ” i. e. حَامِضٌ, “ “ the <i>sour and black mulberry;</i> and توت وحشى, ” i. e. وَحْشِىٌّ, “ and توت العليق, ” i. e. العُلَّيْقٌ, “ the <i>wild mulberry,</i> i. e., <i>with red fruit.</i> ” In Egypt, توت is applied to the <i>sweet mulberry, white</i> and <i>black,</i> and especially to the <i>former,</i> as also توت بَلَدِىّ; and توت شَامِىّ to the <i>latter.</i> In the present day, توت العُلَّيْق is applied to the <i>raspberry;</i> as also توت شَوْكِىّ: and توت وَحْشِىّ, I believe, to the <i>blackberry.</i> <br>\
                  توت اَرْضِىّ and توت اـِفْرَنْجِىّ are applied to the <i>strawberry.</i>]    </entryFree> <br>\

                  , [of the masc. gender, as is shown by the phrase توتياء مَعْدَنِىٌّ, and therefore perfectly decl.,] an arabicized word, (S, Msb,) [<i>Tutia,</i> or <i>tutty; an impure protoxide of zinc;</i>] <i>a certain stone</i> [or <i>mineral</i>], (S, K,) <i>well known,</i> (M, K,) <i>employed as a collyrium.</i> (S, Msb.) [It is also applied in the present day to several kinds of <i>vitriol;</i> the <i>sulphates of zinc</i> and <i>of copper</i> and <i>of iron.</i> De Sacy says, on the authority of Ibn-Beytár, that there are two species thereof; one which is found in mines; the other, in the furnaces in which copper is melted, like <i>cadmia;</i> and this latter species is what the Greeks call <i>pompholyx:</i> of the fossil tutia there are three varieties; one is white; another, greenish; the third, yellow, with a strong tinge of red: the white is the finest  variety; the green, the coarsest. (Chrest. Arabe, 2nd ed., iii. 453; where see more.) Golius, on this word, in his Lex., says, “ Optima est quæ vel naturalis, sc. Indica, cærulea, et pellucida; vel artificialis, sc. Carmanica, alba cum partis viridioris strictura. Zein. ” i. e. Zeyn El-&#39; Attár. “ Ex plumbi præstantissimi, quod dicitur قلعى, fuligine concrescere præstantissimum genus, commune vero ex fuligine æris, tradit Jacutus ex Abulfed. ”.]   </entryFree> <br>\
