                  , (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تُلُوٌّ (S, M, Msb, K) and تَلْوٌ, (Er-Rághib, MF,) <i>I followed him</i> or <i>it;</i> or <i>went,</i> or <i>walked, behind,</i> or <i>after, him</i> or <i>it;</i> (S, M, Msb, K;) namely, a man [&amp;amp;c.]; (S, Msb;) <i>immediately,</i> or <i>without intervention;</i> and sometimes it means <i>bodily</i> [or <i>in reality</i>]; and sometimes, <i>virtually,</i> or <i>in effect:</i> (Er-Rághib:) and so تَلَيْتُهُ; (K;) and ↓ <br>\
      تَلَّيْتُهُ, (As, * T, * K,) inf. n. تَتْلِيَةٌ. (K.) The phrase, in the Kur xci. 2, وَالقَمَرِ اـِذَا تَلَاهَا means <i>By the moon when its rising follows the rising thereof;</i> i. e., the rising of the sun; at the beginning of the lunar month: (Bd:) or, <i>when it follows in rising the setting thereof,</i> (Bd, Jel,) on the night of the full moon: (Bd:) or, <i>when it follows it in becoming round, and in fullness of light;</i> (M, * Bd;) i. e., <i>when it follows it in the way of imitation, and in respect of rank;</i> for the moon borrows its light of the sun, and is to it in the place of a successor. (Er-Rághib.) Here, Ks pronounced تلاها with imáleh, [either because تَلَيْتُ is a dial. var. of تَلَوْتُ, or] because, although it has و for its last radical letter, it occurs with words that may be so pronounced, namely, يَغْشَاهَا and بَنَاهَا. (M.) ―         -b2-  تَلَوْتُ الاِبِلَ (tropical:)  <i>I drove,</i> or <i>brought,</i> or <i>gathered, the camels together, from their several quarters:</i> because the driver follows the driven.

(Er-Rághib, TA.) [You say also, تَلَا عَلَيْهِ <br>\
                  <i>He recited,</i> or <i>related, to him</i> a narrative &amp;amp;c.: see Kur v. 30, &amp;amp;c.] And فُلَانٌ يَتْلُو عَلَى فُلَانٍ, and يَقُولُ عَلَيْهِ, <i>Such a one lies,</i> or <i>says what is false, against such a one.</i> (TA.) وَاْتَّبَعُوا مَا تَتْلُوالشَّيَاطِينُ, in the Kur ii. 96, means [<i>And they followed</i>] <i>what the devils related,</i> or <i>rehearsed,</i> (&#39;Atà, T,) or <i>spoke;</i> (A&#39;Obeyd, T;) or, <i>what the devils</i> of the Jinn, or of mankind, or of both, <i>read,</i> or <i>recited,</i> or what they <i>followed,</i> of the writings of enchantment: (Bd:) some here read ↓ <br>\

      ولا اَتْلَيْتَ: (T, S:) and others say that it is ولا اْيْتَلَيْتَ, from اَلَوْتُ. (T. [See these three readings explained in the latter part of the first paragraph of art. الو.])       -A2-  <i>He remained behind,</i> or <i>held back.</i> (IAar, ISk, T.) You say, تَلَا بَعْدَ قَوْمِهِ <br>\
                  <i>He held back,</i> or <i>lagged behind, after his people,</i> or <i>company, and remained.</i> (TA.) And تَلَوْتُهُ, (AZ, A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, K,) and تَلَوْتُ <br>\

                  , (AZ, T,) inf. n. تُلُوٌّ, (AZ, T, M,) <i>I left him, and held back from going with him:</i> (AZ, T:) <i>I held back from him,</i> or <i>from aiding him, and left him:</i> (AZ, A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, K:) thus the verb bears two contr. significations.
