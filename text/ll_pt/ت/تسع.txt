      تِسْعٌ, so applied, is fem.: (S:) the latter is also written ↓ <br>\
      تَسْعٌ, with fet-h to the ت; and is thus pronounced in the Kur xxxviii. 22, (Bd, MF,) accord. to one reading. (Bd.) You say تِسْعَةُ رِجَالٍ [<i>Nine men</i>], and تِسْعٌ <br>\
                  نِسْوَةٍ [<i>Nine women</i>]. (K.) When it means the things numbered, not the amount of the number, تسعة is imperf. decl., being regarded as a proper name: thus you say, تِسْعَةُ اَكْثَرُ مِنْ ثَمَانِيَةَ [<i>Nine things are more than eight things</i>]. (TA.) It is said in the Kur [xvii. 103], وَ لَقَدْ ا=تَيْنَا مُوسَى تِسْعَ ا=يَاتٍ <br>\
                  بَيِّنَاتٍ [<i>And we formerly gave unto Moses nine evident signs;</i> generally understood to mean the principal miracles which he was empowered to perform, and which are differently enumerated in the K and other works; but by some supposed to mean statutes]. (K, * TA.) ―         -b2-  In تِسْعَةَ عَشَرَ, which is masc., and تِسْعَ عَشْرَةَ, which is fem., [each signifying <i>Nineteen,</i>] each of the two words ends with fet-h in every case, because they are two nouns which are regarded as one noun. (TA.) The former is pronounced by some of the Arabs تِسْعَةَ <br>\
                  عْشَرَ: and the latter, thus in the dial. of El-Hijáz  [and of most of the Arabs], is pronounced تِسْعَ <br>\
                  عَشِرَةَ in the dial. of Nejd. (S in art. عشر.) In the Kur lxxiv. 30, some read, تِسْعَةَ عْشَرَ, making the ع in عشر quiescent, instead of تِسْعَهَ عَشَرَ, from a dislike of this consecution of vowels in what is like one word. (Bd, TA. *)    </entryFree> <br>\
