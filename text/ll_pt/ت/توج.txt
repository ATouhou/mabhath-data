[For the verb تَاجَ, in this or a similar sense, mentioned in the Lexicons of Golius and Freytag, in the former as from the K, I find no authority: on the contrary, it is said in the TA that no verb answering to تَايِجٌ has been heard.] ―         -b2-  <i>He was made,</i> or <i>became, a prince, lord,</i> or <i>chief.</i> (TA.) ―         -b3-  (assumed tropical:)  <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, turbaned,</i> or <i>invested with the turban.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

It is said in a trad., (TA,) العَمَايِمُ تِيجَانُ العَرَبِ [<i>Turbans are the crowns of the Arabs</i>]; (S, TA;) i. e. turbans are to the Arabs as crowns to the kings; for the Arabs in the deserts are [or were] mostly bare-headed or wearing قَلَانِس [pl. of قَلَنْسُوَةٌ, q. v.]; turbans among them being few.
