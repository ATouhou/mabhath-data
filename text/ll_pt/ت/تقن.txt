      اِتَّقَى is originally اِوْتَقَى; (T, S;) then اِيتَقَى; then اِتَّقَى; and when this came to be much in use, they imagined the ت to be a radical part of the word, and made the word اِتَقَى, aor. يَتَقِى, with fet-h to the ت in each case, and without teshdeed; and not finding any analogue to it in their language, they said تَقَى, aor. يَتْقِى, like قَضَى, aor. يَقْضِى: (S:) or, as is said in the T, they suppressed the ت, and the اِتَّقَى changed into ت, in اِتَّقَى, and said تَقَى, aor. يَتْقِى.

[See this verse explained in art. اثر.] IB adds that Aboo-Sa&#39;eed [app. meaning As] disallowed تَقَى, aor. يَتْقِى, inf. n. تَقْىٌ; saying that it would require the imperative to be اِتْقِ, which is not said; and this, he states, is right: [for] J says that the imperative used is تَقِ [<i>Fear thou,</i> or <i>beware thou,</i> &amp;amp;c.], as in تَقِ اْللّٰهِ [<i>Fear thou God</i>]; and to a woman, تَقِى; formed from the verb اِتَقَى, without tesh-deed, by the suppression of the ا.
