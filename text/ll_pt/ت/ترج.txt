      تُرُنْجٌ, (AZ, S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.,) [which is Persian,] a dial. var. of weak authority, (Msb,)  by some disallowed, (MF, TA,) used by the vulgar, (TA,) the ن in which is by common consent held to be augmentative, (MF, TA,) likewise a pl., (TA,) [or coll. gen. n.,] and ↓ <br>\
      اُتْرُنْجٌ, mentioned by Ibn-Hishám El-Lakhmee, in his Faseeh, and also used by the vulgar, (TA,) and by some of the people of Hims, (Lth cited in the L voce حَظٌّ, q. v.,) [and this is likewise a coll. gen. n.,] and اُتْرُجَّةٌ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.,) which is the sing. of the first, (AHát, MF, TA,) or its n. un., (L, Msb,) also pronounced اُتْرُجَةٌ, without teshdeed, (TA,) and ↓ <br>\
