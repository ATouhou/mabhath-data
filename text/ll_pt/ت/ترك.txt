                  , (S, M,) inf. n. تَرْكٌ (S, M, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.) and ترْكَانٌ, with kesr, (Fr, K,) <i>He left it, forsook it, relinquished it, abandoned it, deserted it,</i> or <i>quitted it;</i> either <i>intentionally, and by choice,</i> or <i>by constraint, and of necessity:</i> (Er-Rághib, TA:) <i>he left it, forsook it,</i> &amp;amp;c., as above; namely, a thing that he desired, or wished for, and also a thing that he did not desire, or did not wish for: (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, TA:) <i>he left it, quitted it, went away from it,</i> or <i>departed from it;</i> namely, a place: and <i>he left him, forsook him, relinquished him, abandoned him, deserted him, quitted him,</i> or <i>separated himself from him:</i> (Msb:) <i>he cast it,</i> or <i>threw it, away, as a thing of no account; rejected it; discarded it; cast it off; left it off:</i> (MF, TA:) <i>he left it, left it alone, let it alone; ceased, desisted, forbore,</i> or <i>abstained, from it; neglected it, omitted it,</i> or <i>left it undone;</i> syn. خَلَّاهُ; (S, A, O;) or وَدَعَهُ; (M, K;) as also ↓ <br>\
      اتّركهُ. (K. [But respecting this latter verb, see what follows.]) وَاْتْرُكِ <br>\
                  البَحْرَ رَهْوًا, in the Kur xliv. 23, <i>And leave thou the sea opened with a wide interval;</i> or <i>motionless,</i> in the same state as before thy passing through it, and strike it not with thy rod, nor alter anything thereof; (Bd;) or <i>motionless, parted asunder;</i> (Jel;) so that the Egyptians may enter it; (Bd, Jel;) is an instance of the verb meaning leaving intentionally, and by choice: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and كَمْ تَرَكُوا مِنْ جَنَّاتٍ وَعُيُونٍ, in the next verse, <i>How many gardens and springs did they leave!</i> (Jel,) is an instance of the verb meaning leaving by constraint, and of necessity. (Er-Rághib, TA.) In a phrase such as تَرَكَ حَقَّهُ, meaning <i>He made his right,</i> or <i>due,</i> or <i>claim, to be null,</i> or <i>he rejected it,</i> and such as تَرَكَ رَكْعَةٌ مِنَ الصَّلَاةِ, meaning <i>He neglected, omitted,</i> or <i>left unperformed, a</i> <br>\
                  ركعة, <i>of the prayer,</i> [it is said (but I think it doubtful) that] the verb, having an ideal substantive for its objective complement, is used metaphorically. (Msb.) ↓ <br>\
      قَالَ فِيهِ فَمَا اْتَّرَكَ means مَا <br>\
                  تَرَكَ شَيْيًا [i. e. <i>He strove, laboured,</i> or <i>exerted himself,</i> (اِجْتَهَدَ,) <i>in it, and neglected not,</i> or <i>omitted not, anything</i> in his power]: the verb is of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ. (S.) مَنْ اَوْصَى بِالثُّلُثِ وَلَمْ <br>\
                  شَيْيًا ↓ <br>\
      يَتَّرِكْ is a mistake for ولم يَتْرُكْ شَيْيًا, or ولم ↓ <br>\
      يَتَّرِكْ without شَيْيًا, or فَمَا اْتَّرَكَ; for this verb is not trans., except, sometimes, in poetry; and the meaning is, وَلَمْ يَتْرُكْ فِيمَااُذِنَ لَهُ فِيهِ شَيْيًا [i. e. <i>He who bequeaths the third</i> of his property, <i>and does not omit anything</i> of what he is allowed (to leave, or anything of the third part, for this is all that he is allowed to bequeath)]: it is from the saying ↓ <br>\
      فَعَلَ فَمَا اْتَّرَكَ [<i>He did</i> such a thing, <i>and neglected not,</i> or <i>omitted not, anything</i>]. (Mgh.) You say also, تَرَكَ المَيِّتُ مَالًا, i. e. <i>The deceased left property.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b2-  وَتَرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ فِى الا=خِرِينَ, (K,) in the Kur [xxxvii. 76 &amp;amp;c.], (TA,) means <i>And we have perpetuated</i> (K, Jel, TA) <i>to him</i> a eulogy <i>among the later generations</i> (Jel, TA) of the prophets and peoples to the day of resurrection, [namely,] Salutation &amp;amp;c. (Jel.) ―         -b3-  التَّرْكُ is also <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  الجَعْلُ, (Lth, K, TA,) in some instances; (Lth, TA;) as though it had two contr. significations: (K:) [i. e.,] when تَرَكَ is doubly trans., it has the meaning of صَيَّرَ, (MF, TA,) or جَعَلَ. (TA.) So in the saying, تَرَكْتُ الحَبْلَ شَدِيدًا <br>\
                  <i>I made,</i> or <i>rendered, the rope strong;</i> or <i>made it,</i> or <i>caused it, to be,</i> or <i>become, strong.</i> (TA.) So too in the Kur ii. 16, وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِى ظُلُمَاتٍ <br>\
                  <i>And maketh,</i> or <i>causeth, them to be in darknesses.</i> (Ksh, Bd, MF.) And sometimes one says of any action that has come at last to a certain state, مَا تَرَكْتُهُ كَذَا [<i>I did not make it,</i> or <i>cause it, to be thus</i>]. (TA.)       -A2-  تَرِكَ, aor.      <br>\
                     تَرَكَ<br>\
                  , (IAar, K,) inf. n. تَرْكٌ, (TK,) <i>He</i> (a man, IAar) <i>married,</i> i. e. <i>took to wife, a</i> <br>\
                  تَرِيكَة, (IAar, K,) meaning <i>a woman that had remained a virgin, unmarried, until she had become of middle age,</i> or <i>long after she had attained to puberty, in the house,</i> or <i>tent, of her parents.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>تاركهُ</b>               1     <br>\

                     تاركة<br>\
                   [inf. n. مُتَارَكَةٌ] is <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  خَالَاهُ (S in art. خلو) [which is explained in the K, in art. خلو, as <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  تَرَكَهُ, <i>He left, forsook, relinquished, abandoned,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>him</i> or <i>it;</i> and thus it may often be well rendered: but it properly signifies <i>he left him, forsook him,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>being left,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>by him;</i> whence it is said in the Mgh, in art. ودع, that مُوَادَعَةُ is syn. with مُصَالَحَةٌ because it is مُتَارَكَةٌ: Golius, as on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof, explains تاركهُ as signifying <i>he dismissed him, and did not molest him: he left him unmolested</i> is one of its meanings, but is not the primary signification: accord. to the TK, متاركة signifies the <i>leaving,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>anything in the state in which it is:</i> and the <i>leaving,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>one another</i>]. One says also, تَارَكْتُهُ البَيْعَ, (S, Mgh, but in the latter تَارَكَهُ, and in the TA فِى البَيْعِ,) وَغَيْرَهُ, (Mgh,) inf. n. مُتَارَكَةٌ, (S,) [app. meaning <i>I relinquished with him,</i> i. e. <i>concurrently with him, the sale, &amp;amp;c.:</i> see 6, by which this rendering is confirmed: Golius, as on the authority of J, who has not explained it, says that it means <i>I relinquished to him the merchandise,</i> or <i>commodity;</i> and Freytag follows him.] ―         -b2-  [Hence,] مُتَارَكَةٌ is metonymically used as meaning The <i>making peace</i> [or <i>a truce</i>], or <i>reconciling oneself, with another</i> or <i>others.</i> (Mgh.) ―         -b3-  In the saying, لَا بَارَكَ اْللّٰهُ <br>\
                  فِيِهِ وَلَا تَارَكَ وَلَا دَارَكَ, it is an imitative sequent, (K,) all of these verbs having the same meaning [so that the saying may be rendered <i>May God not bless him nor felicitate him nor make him happy</i>]: (TA:) [or the meaning may be, <i>nor preserve him,</i> or <i>prolong his life;</i> for] IAar says that تَارَكَ means اَبْقَى.
