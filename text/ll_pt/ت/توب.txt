                  , (T, A,) or تاب اـِلَى اْللّٰهِ, (S, M, K,) aor. يَتُوبُ, (Msb,) inf. n. تَوْبَةٌ and تَوْبٌ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) both of these signifying the same, (T, S, M, Msb,) the ة in the former being added to denote the fem. gender, or, as some say, the former is a n. un. like ضَرْبَةٌ, (Msb,) or, as Akh says, تَوْبٌ is pl. [or a quasi-pl. n.] of تَوْبَةٌ, like as عَوْمٌ is of عَوْمَةٌ, (S,) or like as لَوْزٌ is of لَوْزَةٌ, and this is the opinion of Mbr, (M,) and تَابَةٌ, (M, K,) which is for تَوْبَةٌ, (M,) and مَتَابٌ (S, M, A, K) and تَتْوِبَةٌ, (S, * M, * K,) of the measure تَفْعِلَةٌ, (S, M,) an anomalous form, (TA,) syn. with تَوْبَةٌ, mentioned in the Book of Sb; (S;) [<i>He repented;</i> or <i>repented toward God;</i> as will be shown by what follows:] originally, <i>he returned unto God,</i> (T, TA,) مِنْ كَذَا and عَنْ كَذَا [<i>from such a thing</i>]: (TA:) or <i>he returned,</i> [or <i>returned unto God,</i>] (S, M, A, K,) <i>from sin,</i> (S,) or <i>from his sin,</i> (A,) or <i>from disobedience</i> (M, K) <i>to obedience:</i> (M:) or تَابَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ signifies <i>he desisted from his sin:</i> (Msb:) تَوْبَةٌ signifies the <i>repenting of sin;</i> i. e. the <i>grieving for it,</i> or <i>regretting it, with the confession of having no excuse for the commission thereof.</i> (Kull.) It is said in a trad., النَّدَمُ تَوْبَةٌ [<i>Repentance is</i>] <i>a returning from sin.</i> (S.) The time of El-Islám is termed زَمَنُ التَّوْبَةِ as being <i>The time of returning from</i> [or <i>repenting of</i>] <i>the belief in a plurality of gods.</i> (A.) A poet says, <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\

                  <i>God returned to forgiveness towards him; became again forgiving to him:</i> (T:) or <i>disposed,</i> or <i>adapted, him to repentance,</i> or <i>returning from sin</i> or <i>disobedience:</i> (S, K:) or <i>reverted from severity to mildness towards him:</i> or <i>returned to him with his favour,</i> or <i>grace, and his acceptance,</i> or <i>approbation;</i> <br>\
                  <i>became again propitious to him:</i> (A, K:) all these meanings are correct: (TA:) or <i>God forgave him, and saved him from acts of disobedience:</i> (Msb:) or <i>accepted his repentance:</i> (Jel in ii. 35 &amp;amp;c.:) or <i>returned towards him with mercy, and acceptance of repentance.</i> (Bd ibid.)    </entryFree> <br>\

<b>تَابُوتٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     تَابُوتٌ<br>\
                     تابوت<br>\
                  , originally تَوَبُوتٌ, the ت not being the characteristic of the fem. gender, (Z, MF, TA,) of the measure فَعَلُوتٌ, and meaning <i>A chest,</i> or <i>box,</i> from التَّوْبُ, because what is taken out from it continually returns to it: (AAF, IJ, Z, MF, TA:) or originally تَابُوَةٌ; (S, K; [in the CK تَاْبُوَةٌ;]) the و being made quiescent, and the ة changed into ت: (S, K:) [in Chald. <H>?</H>: in Hebr. <H>?</H>:] it signifies also the <i>ribs, with what they contain, as the heart and the liver &amp;amp;c.;</i> as being likened to a chest, or box; (IAth, TA in art. تبت;) the <i>chest, breast,</i> or <i>bosom:</i> (A in that art.:) or [primarily] the <i>ribs, with what they contain, as the heart &amp;amp;c.:</i> and [hence] applied to <i>a chest,</i> or <i>box:</i> (Towsheeh, MF, TA:) also written تَبُوتٌ. (K in art. تبت.) [It is generally applied in the present day to <i>a bier: a coffin:</i> and <i>an oblong case that is placed over a grave:</i> the pl. is تَوَابِيتُ.] El-Kásim Ibn-Maan says that it is the only word in the Kur-án in respect of which the dialects of Kureysh and the Ansár differ; the former pronouncing it تَابُوتٌ; (S;) and the latter, تَابُوهٌ. (S, K.) But IB denies that its last letter is originally ة, the fem. termination; asserting the final ت to be a radical letter, the measure of the word to be فَاعُولٌ, and its proper place in art. تبت: he says that the final ت is changed in a case of pause, but not generally, into ه, as is that of الفُرَات [the Euphrates], in which the ت is not the fem. termination. (L, TA.) You say, مَا اَوْدَعْتُ تَابُوتِى شَيْيًا فَقَدْتُهُ, meaning <i>I have not deposited in my bosom anything</i> of knowledge, or science, <i>that I have lost.</i> (A in art. تبت.)    </entryFree> <br>\
