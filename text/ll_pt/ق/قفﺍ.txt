                  &lt;/form&gt; is said in the K to be syn. with افتقاهُ, [q. v.,] and is expl. by Lh as meaning &lt;i&gt;He repeated the&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;kind of sewing termed&lt;/i&gt;] خَرْز [i. e. the sewing of skins and the like by means of an awl], &lt;i&gt;and added, between the two kulbehs, another kulbeh,&lt;/i&gt; as is done with reed-mats when they are re-sewed. (TA.) [The kulbeh (كُلْبَة, q. v.) is here described as a thong, or a strand (طَاقَة) of [the membranous fibres that grow at the base of the branches of the palm-tree and are called] لِيف, used in the same manner as the shoemaker&#39;s awl, &amp;amp;c., as in art. كلب, q. v.; but what is here meant by this word is evidently, I think, a thong, or the like, with which a skin is sewed, agreeably with another explanation of it in art. كلب.]   &lt;/entryFree&gt; <br>\
