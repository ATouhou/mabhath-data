      قصّصهُ, (M, A,) and, by permutation, قَصَّاهُ: (M:) or these two forms have an intensive signification: or you say, الظُّفْرَ وَنَحْوَهُ ↓ <br>\
      قَصَّيْتُ, meaning, <i>I pared the nail and the like.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b2-  Also, <i>He</i> (a weaver) <i>cut off from it,</i> namely, a garment, or piece of cloth, <i>its unwoven end,</i> or <i>extremity, consisting of warp without woof.</i> (M.) ―         -b3-  And <i>He cut off the extremities of his ears.</i> (IAar, M.) قُصِّيهِ occurs in a trad., as meaning, <i>Take thou from the extremities of his ears.</i> (TA.) [But this may be from the root قصو, q. v.] ―         -b4-  And [hence,] قَصَّ اْللّٰهُ خَطَايَاهُ (assumed tropical:)  <i>God diminished,</i> or <i>took</i> or <i>deducted from,</i> [<i>the account of</i>] <i>his sins.</i> (TA, from a trad.)       -A2-  قَصَّ اَثَرَهُ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) aor.      <br>\

                  , (M, TA,) inf. n. قَصَصٌ, (S, M, A, O, L, K,) in [some of] the copies of the K قَصِيصٌ, but the former is the right, (TA,) and قَصٌّ, (T, M, K,) <i>He followed,</i> or <i>followed after, his track,</i> or <i>footsteps, in pursuit; endeavoured to trace him,</i> or <i>track him;</i> (S, M, A, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.;) or <i>he did so by degrees:</i> (TA:) or <i>by night:</i> or <i>at any time:</i> (M, TA:) which last is the correct explanation: (TA:) and قَصَّهُ signifies the same, (A, TA,) and so اثره ↓ <br>\
      اقتصّ, (S, K,) and اثره ↓ <br>\
      تقصّص: (S, M, K:) and قَسَّ is a dial. form of the same. (TA.) You say, خَرَجَ فُلَانٌ <br>\
                  قَصَصًا فِى اَثَرِ فُلَانٍ <br>\
                  <i>Such a one went forth following,</i> or <i>following after, the footsteps of such a one, in pursuit.</i> (TA.) And it is said in the Kur, [xviii. 63,] (S,) فَاْرْتَدَّا عَلَى ا=ثَارِهِمَا قَصَصًا (S, K) <i>And they both returned by the way by which they had come, retracing their footsteps.</i> (K, TA.) ―         -b2-  [And hence,] قَصَّ عَلَيْهِ الخَبَرَ, (S, M, Msb, * K, *) and الحَدِيثَ, and الرُّوْيَا, (A,) aor.      <br>\
                     قَصُ٣َ<br>\
                  , (M, TA,) inf. n. قَصَصٌ, (M, TA,) or this is a subst. put in the place of the inf. n. so that it has become predominant over it, (S,) and قَصٌّ, (M, TA,) or the latter only is the inf. n., and the former is [only] a subst., (Msb,) <i>He related to him the piece of news,</i> or <i>information,</i> (S, M, Msb,) and <i>the tradition,</i> or <i>story,</i> and <i>the dream,</i> (A,) <i>in its proper manner</i> (عَلَى وَجْهِهِ): (S, Msb:) or <i>he made it known</i> [<i>to him</i>]: (K:) and الحَدِيثَ ↓ <br>\
      اقتصّ <br>\
                  <i>he related the tradition,</i> or <i>story, in its proper manner</i> (عَلَى وَجْهِهِ); (S, K, TA;) <i>as though he followed its traces, in pursuit, and related it accordingly:</i> (TA:) [i. e., <i>he pursued the course of the tradition,</i> or <i>story:</i>] and الخَبَرَ ↓ <br>\
      تقصّص <br>\
                  <i>he pursued,</i> or <i>sought after, the particulars of the news,</i> or <i>information, gradually, and deliberately.</i> (M.) قَصَّ is also said to signify <i>He recited,</i> or <i>delivered, a</i> [<i>discourse such as is termed</i>] خُطْبَة. (TA.) And it is said in the Kur, [xii. 3,] نَحْنُ نَقُصُّ <br>\
                  عَلَيْكَ اَحْسَنَ القَصَصِ <br>\
                  <i>We explain unto thee with the best explanation:</i> (K, TA:) or, as some say, قَصٌّ is the inf. n. of the verb used in this sense, and قَصَصٌ is a subst. [syn. with قِصَّةٌ, q. v.]. (TA.) And in a trad. respecting the Children of Israel it is said, لَمَّا قَصُّوا هَلَكُوا: or لَمَّا هَلَكُوا قَصُّوا: accord. to different relations: meaning, <i>When they relied upon words,</i> and neglected works, <i>they perished:</i> or <i>when they perished,</i> by neglecting works, <i>they inclined to, and relied upon, stories.</i> (TA.)       -A3-  قَصَّهُ المَوْتُ, and قَصَّهُ عَلَى المَوْتِ, or مِنَ المَوْتِ: see 4.    </entryFree> <br>\

                  , (Msb,) inf. n. مُقَاصَّةٌ (A, Mgh, Msb) and قِصَاصٌ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) [which latter is the more common,] <i>He</i> (the relation of a slain man, A, Mgh, TA, or one who has been wounded, Mgh, [or mutilated,]) <i>retaliated upon him by slaying him,</i> or <i>wounding him,</i> (S, * Mgh, Msb, K,) or <i>mutilating him,</i> (S, * Msb, K, *) <i>so as to make him quit,</i> or <i>even, with him.</i> (Mgh.) See also 8. ―         -b2-  Hence, (A, Mgh,) (tropical:)  <i>He made him quit,</i> or <i>even, with himself:</i> used in a general way. (Mgh.) You say, قاصّ صَاحِبَهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, * K,) inf. ns. as above, (Msb,) (tropical:)  <i>He made his fellow quit,</i> or <i>even, with him,</i> (Mgh,) in a reckoning, (S, Mgh, K,) or other thing, (S, K,) <i>by withholding from him the like of what the latter owed to him;</i> (Mgh;) <i>he made a debt which his fellow owed him to be as a requital of a like debt which he owed his fellow:</i> [but Fei adds,] this is taken from اـِقْتِصَاصُ الاَثَرِ: and hence the former signification, relating to retaliation of slaughter and  wounding and mutilation, which, however, is the predominant signification. (Msb.) You say also, قَاصَصْتُهُ بِمَا كَانَ لِى قَبْلَهُ, [or, more probably, قِبَلَهُ, or perhaps عَلَيْهِ,] (tropical:)  <i>I withheld from him the like of what he owed me.</i> (A, TA.) ISd says, (TA,) The phrase قُوصَّ زَيْدٌ مَا عَلَيْهِ has been mentioned; and means, in my opinion, (assumed tropical:)  <i>Zeyd was reckoned with for what he owed:</i> though made trans. without a particle, as implying the meaning of اُغْرِمَ and the like.

                  <i>He</i> (a governor, or prince,) <i>retaliated for such a one upon such a one,</i> (S, K,) <i>by wounding the latter like as he had wounded the former,</i> (S, Msb, K,) or <i>by slaying the latter for the slaughter of the former;</i> (S, K;) and <i>the like.</i> (TA.) ―         -b2-  اقصّ الرَّجُلُ مِنُ نَفْسِهِ <br>\

(M, TA.) This is the primary signification of the verb.
