You say, هٰذِهِ الدَّابَّةُ فِيهَا قِمَاصٌ; you should not say قُمَاصٌ; (S;) or you say قُمَاصٌ also; (TA;) and قَمَاصٌ, which last is the most chaste; (L, TA;) <i>This beast has in her a property of raising and putting down her fore legs together, and beating the ground with her hind legs.</i> (S.) And it is said in a proverb, (S,) مَا بِالعَيْرِ مِنْ قِمَاصٍ, (S, A, K,) and قُمَاصٍ; (Sgh, TA; and so, as well as قِمَاصٍ, in two copies of the S;) i. e. الحِمَار; (S;) [<i>There is not in the ass any power of raising and putting down his fore legs together,</i> &amp;amp;c.;] applied to him who has become low, or mean, after being high, in rank, or condition; (S, A, K;) and to a weak man, in whom is no activity: (A, K:) or, as the proverb is related by Sb, اَفَلَا قُمَاصَ بِالعَيْرِ [<i>Is there not, then, any power</i> &amp;amp;c. <i>in the ass?</i>] (M, TA.)

                  <i>And it leaped,</i> or <i>sprang,</i> or <i>bounded, and took fright, and ran away at random,</i> or <i>shied, with him, and threw him down.</i> (TA.) You also say, النَّاقَةُ بِالرَّدِيفِ ↓ <br>\

(TA.) You say also, اَخَذَهُ القِمَاصُ (tropical:)  <i>Restlessness,</i> or <i>inquietude,</i> or <i>unsteadiness, seized him.</i> (A, TA.) And, of a horse whose sciatic vein or nerve is contracted, (شَنِجَ, [not شبح as in Freytag&#39;s Lexicon,]) قَمَصَتْ رِجْلُةُ [app. meaning, <i>His hind leg became twitched up,</i> as in springhalt]: in which case you also say of him, العُرْقُوبِ ↓ <br>\
