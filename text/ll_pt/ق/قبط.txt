                  اقباط being a pl. of قِبْطٌ]. (TA.) [See قُبْطِىٌّ.] Authors differ respecting their pedigree: some say, that القِبْطُ was son of حَام [or Ham], son of نُوح [or Noah]: the author of the Shejereh, that مِصْرَايِيم [or Mizraïm] the son of حام left issue from لُوذِيم [or Ludim], and that لوذيم are the قِبْط of Egypt, in the Sa&#39;eed: Aboo-Háshim Ahmad Ibn-Jaafar El-&#39;Abbásee, the genealogist, says, that they are the children of قِبْط son of مِصْر son of قُوط [a mistranscription for فُوط, the Phut of the English Bible, A. V.,] son of حام: and this is verified by Ibn-El-Joowánee the genealogist. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\

      ثِيَابٌ قِبْطِيَّةٌ, with kesr; but when you convert the rel. n. into a subst, you say قُبْطِيَّةٌ, with damm, to distinguish the subst. from the rel. n. without ثياب; like as you say, رِمَاحٌ خَطِّيَّةٌ, and خِطِّيَّةٌ, with kesr, when you do not mention the رماح: so says Kh: (Msb in art. خط:) it is said in the K, that القُبْطِيَّةُ, with damm, signifies <i>a kind of cloths,</i> so called in relation to the قِبْط; and sometimes it is with kesr; which is a plain assertion that the form with damm is the more common: but in the S it is said, that القِبْطِيِّةُ signifies <i>certain white, thin,</i> or <i>fine, cloths, of linen, made in Egypt;</i> and sometimes it is with damm, because they make a change in the rel. n., as in سُهْلِىٌّ and دُهْرِىٌّ, which (as SM adds) are from سَهْلٌ and دَهْرٌ; and this indicates that the regular form, with kesr, is the more common: (TA:) the pl. is قَبَاطِىٌّ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and قَبَاطِى: (K [but the latter, being indeterminate, should be written قَبَاطٍ, like مَهَارٍ &amp;amp;c.:]) Sh says, that the قَبَاطِىّ are <i>a kind of cloths inclining to fineness and thinness and whiteness.</i> (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
