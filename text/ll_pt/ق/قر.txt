(TA.) قَوَارِيرَ قَوَارِيرَ مِنْ فِضَّةٍ, in the Kur, [lxxvi. 15 and 16,] is said by some learned men to mean <i>Vessels,</i> [<i>vessels</i>] <i>white as silver and clear as</i> <br>\
                  قوارير.  [See also art. فض.] An ا is added by some to the final قوارير [of verse 15] in order that the ends of the verses may be similar. (M.) ―         -b2-  <i>A receptacle for fresh, or dried, dates;</i> also called قَوْصَرَةٌ. (Msb.) ―         -b3-  (tropical:)  The <i>black of the eye;</i> the <i>part, of the eye, that is surrounded by the white:</i> (M, K:) as being likened to قارورة of glass, because of its clearness, and because the observer sees his image in it. (M, TA.) [See an ex. in a verse cited in the first paragraph of art. سلب.] ―         -b4-  (tropical:)  <i>A woman,</i> or <i>wife;</i> as also قَوْصَرَّةٌ: (Az, Msb:) called by the former appellation because the child, or the seed, rests in her womb, as a thing rests in a vessel, and as being likened to a vessel of glass because of her weakness. (Msb.) Hence the words [of Mohammad] in a trad., رُوَيْدَكَ رِفْقًا بِاْلْقَوَارِيرِ [<i>Go thou leisurely: act gently with the</i> <br>\
                  قَوَارير]: women being here likened to قوارير of glass because of their weakness of purpose, and their fickleness; for such vessels are soon broken and cannot be restored to soundness: meaning, that the man thus addressed, named اَنْجَشَة (Anjesheh), [a freedman of Mohammad,] should not raise his voice and sing in driving the camels, for fear of the women&#39;s having their desires excited by what they heard; or for fear that the camels, hearing the singing, should go quickly, and jolt and fatigue the riders.
