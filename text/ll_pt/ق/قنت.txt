                   is the inf. n. of قَنَتَ, (MA, Msb,) aor.      <br>\
                     قَنُتَ<br>\
                  , (Msb,) and signifies The <i>being obedient:</i> (S, M, MA, Mgh, K, TA:) or the <i>being constantly obedient:</i> (IAmb, O, TA:) the former is the primary meaning: and hence, in the Kur [xxxiii. 35], ↓ <br>\
      وَاْلْقَانِتَاتِ ↓ <br>\
      وَاْلْقَانِتِينَ [<i>And the obedient men and the obedient women</i>]. (S, M, TA.) One says, قَنَتَ لِلّٰهِ, (MA,) and قَنَتَ اْللّٰهَ, (TA,) [but this latter is unusual, the former only being authorized by the Kur-án (in iii. 38 and xxxiii. 31),] meaning <i>He was obedient to God.</i> (MA, TA.) And it is said in the Kur [ii. 110 and xxx. 25], ↓ <br>\
      كُلٌّ لَهُ قَانِتُونَ i. e. <i>All are obedient unto Him:</i> but the meaning here is, that the beings in heaven [and earth] are created by the will of God, and that none of them can alter the form in which it is created; the obedience here spoken of being obedience to the will [of God], not the obedience of religious service; some of them being obedient [in this sense], and others being disobedient. (L, TA.) [It is said that] the proper signification of ↓ <br>\
      القَانِتُ [or the signification that implies all the meanings of the word] is <i>The performer of the command of God.</i> (L, TA.) ―         -b2-  It signifies also The act of <i>standing;</i> (Mgh, TA;) mentioned by Th, and asserted by him to be the primary meaning. (TA.) And (TA) The <i>standing long.</i> (IAmb, O, TA.) And (TA) The <i>standing in the performance of the divinely-appointed act of prayer.</i> (S, Msb, K, TA.) [See also 4.] Hence, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) it is said in a trad. (S, TA) of the Prophet, as a reply given by him to the question اَىُّ الصَّلَاةِ <br>\
                  اَفْضَلُ, (TA,) اَفْضَلُ الصَّلَاةِ طُولُ القُنُوتِ (S, Mgh, Msb, TA) i. e. [<i>The most excellent characteristic of the performance of the divinely-appointed act of prayer is</i>] <i>the long continuance of the standing.</i> (Mgh, * Msb, * TA.) And hence, قُنُوتُ الوِتْرِ; (S; [see art. وتر;]) or [as it is also termed] دُعَا=ءُ <br>\
                  القُنُوتِ, which means <i>The supplication of the standing;</i> (Msb;) for one utters the supplication standing: (TA:) and what is thus termed (دُعَا=ءُ <br>\
                  القُنُوتِ) is as follows: اَللَّهُمَّ اـِنَّا نَسْتَعِينُكَ وَنَسْتَغْفِرُكَ <br>\
                  وَنُوْمِنُ بِكَ وَنَتَوَكَّلُ عَلَيْكَ وَنُثْنِى عَلَيْكَ الخَيْرَ وَلَا <br>\
                  نَكْفُرُكَ وَنَخْلَعُ وَنَتْرُكُ مَنْ يَفْجُرُكَ اَللّٰهُمَّ اـِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ <br>\
                  وَلَكَ نُصَلِّى وَنَسْجُدُ وَاـِلَيْكَ نَسْعَى وَنَحْفِدُ نَرْجُو رَحْمَتَكَ <br>\
                  وَنَخْشَى عَذَابَكَ اـِنَّ عَذَابَكَ بِالكُفَّارِ مُلْحِقٌ i. e. <i>O God, verily we beg of Thee aid</i> to be obedient and to forsake disobedience, <i>and we beg of Thee forgiveness</i> of sins, [<i>and we believe in Thee, and we rely</i> <br>\
                  <i>upon Thee,</i>] <i>and we laud Thee well, and we will not be unthankful to Thee for Thy favour, and we cast off and forsake him who disobeys Thee:</i> [<i>O God, Thee we worship, and to Thee we perform the divinely-appointed act of prayer, and prostrate ourselves;</i>] <i>and we are quick in working for Thee and in serving Thee: we hope for Thy mercy, and we dread Thy punishment: verily Thy punishment overtakes the unbelievers;</i> thus this clause is expl. on the authority of Ks: or, as some say, it means, <i>causes</i> others <i>to overtake,</i> or <i>become associated with, the unbelievers.</i> (Mgh. [See also art. لحق.]) It is said of the Prophet, قَنَتَ شَهْرًا <br>\
                  فِى صَلَاةِ الصُّبْحِ بَعْدَ الرُّكُوعِ يَدْعُو عَلَى رِعْلٍ وَذَكُوَانَ [<i>He stood during a month, in the prayer of daybreak, after</i> (the prayers of) <i>the</i> <br>\
                  رُكُوع (pl. of رَكَعَ, q. v.), <i>cursing</i> (the tribes of) <i>Rial and Dhekwán</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b3-  Also The act of <i>supplicating</i> [<i>God</i>]: (Zj, Mgh, O, Msb, K, TA:) this is the signification [most] commonly known. (Zj, Mgh, O, TA.) And [particularly, accord. to general usage,] The <i>supplicating God</i> [<i>by addressing Him with the form of words mentioned above as used in what is termed</i> <br>\
                  دُعَا=ءُ القُنُوتِ], <i>doing so standing.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  And The <i>divinely-appointed act of prayer;</i> syn. صَلَاةٌ. (IAmb, O, TA.) ―         -b5-  And The <i>being silent;</i> (O, Msb, K, TA;) by which is meant (O, * TA) the <i>withholding oneself from talking;</i> (O, * K, TA;) <i>in,</i> or <i>during,</i> [<i>the prayer called</i>] الصَّلَاة. (O, * Msb, TA.) Hence, (O, Msb, TA,) accord. to a trad., (O, TA,) the saying in the Kur [ii. 239], وَقُومُوا ↓ <br>\
      لِلّٰهِ قَانِتِينَ [<i>And stand ye unto God,</i> in the divinely-appointed act of prayer, <i>refraining from talking</i>]. (O, Msb, TA.) ―         -b6-  And The <i>serving of God.</i> (TA.) ―         -b7-  And The <i>continuing of the performance of the pilgrimage.</i> (TA.) One says, [قَنَتَ and] ↓ <br>\
      اقنت, meaning <i>He continued the performance of the pilgrimage.</i> (IAar, O, K, TA.) ―         -b8-  And The <i>prolonging of engaging in warring,</i> or <i>warring and plundering.</i> (TA.) One says, [قَنَتَ and] ↓ <br>\
      اقنت, meaning <i>He prolonged the engaging in warring,</i> or <i>warring and plundering.</i> (IAar, O, K, TA.) ―         -b9-  And The <i>confessing,</i> or <i>acknowledging, one&#39;s being in the condition of a servant</i> [<i>to God</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b10-  And The <i>being lowly, humble,</i> or <i>submissive:</i> (A, TA:) or the <i>keeping to obedience</i> [<i>to God</i>], <i>with lowliness, humility,</i> or <i>submissiveness.</i> (Er-Rághib, TA.) One says, قَنَتَ لَهُ <br>\
                  <i>He was,</i> or <i>became, lowly, humble,</i> or <i>submissive, to him.</i> (TA.) And قَنَتَتِ المراة لِزَوْجِهَا, (A,) or لِبَعْلِهَا, (TA,) <i>The woman was,</i> or <i>became, lowly, humble,</i> or <i>submissive, and obedient, to her husband:</i> (A:) or <i>was,</i> or <i>became, quiet and submissive;</i> syn. اَقَرَّت. (TA.) [See also 4, and 8.]       -A2-  قَنَاتَةٌ [is an inf. n., of which the verb is قَنُتَ, like قَتُنَ, and] signifies The <i>eating little</i> [like قَتَانَةٌ]. (K.)    </entryFree> <br>\
