                  قُطْرُب in some one of the senses assigned to it in what follows. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
<b>قُطْرُبٌ</b>               1     <br>\
                     قُطْرُبٌ<br>\
                     ذ<br>\
                  <i>A certain bird;</i> (S, O, K;) [app. <i>a species of owl;</i> accord. to Dmr, as cited by Freytag, <i>a bird that roves about by night and does not sleep;</i> and hence rendered by him, and by Golius, <i>strix.</i> No other meaning of the word, as an appellative, is mentioned in the S.] ―         -b2-  And <i>A certain insect that rests not all the day, going about,</i> or <i>going about quickly,</i> (O, K, TA,) or, as they used to assert in the Time of Ignorance, <i>that never rests,</i> (TA,) <i>moving about on the surface of water.</i> (KL.) Mohammad Ibn-El-Mustaneer, (K, TA,) the grammarian, (TA,) was surnamed قُطْرُب because he used to go early in the morning to Seebaweyh; so that the latter, whenever he opened his door, found him there; wherefore he said to him, مَا اَنْتَ اـِلَّا قُطْرُبُ لَيْلٍ [<i>Thou art none other than a kutrub of night</i>]. (K, * TA.) It is also expl. in the K as meaning <i>Light,</i> or <i>active;</i> and Th mentions that it signifies thus; and adds that one says, اـِنَّهُ لَقُطْرُبُ لَيْلٍ [<i>Verily he is a kutrub of night</i>]; but this shows that it means an insect [described above], and is not [properly speaking] an epithet. (TA.) To this insect is likened a man who labours during the day in accomplishing worldly wants and in the evening is fatigued so that he sleeps during the night until he enters upon the time of morning to betake himself to the like thereof, هٰذَا جِيفَةُ لَيْلِ قُطْرُبُ <br>\
                  نَهَارٍ [lit. <i>This is a corpse of the night, a kutrub of the day</i>]. (O, from an explanation of a trad.) [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i. 329 and 643.] ―         -b3-  And [hence, app.,] (assumed tropical:)  <i>A thief who is skilful,</i> or <i>active, in thievishness:</i> (O, M, TA:) for اللِّصُّ <br>\
                  الفَارِهُ فِى اللُّصُوصِيَّةِ, an explanation of القُطْرُبُ given [in the O and] by IM and others, the copies of the K erroneously substitute اللِّصُ وَالفَاْرَةُ [as though قُطْرُبٌ had the significations of <i>a thief</i> and <i>a rat</i> or <i>mouse</i>]. (TA.) ―         -b4-  And The <i>male</i> (Lth, O, K, TA) <i>of the</i> [<i>kind of demon called</i>] سِعْلَاة (Lth, TA) or <i>of the</i> <br>\
                  غُول [which is said to signify the same as سعلاة]; as also ↓ <br>\
      قُطْرُوبٌ. (O, K, TA.) ―         -b5-  And [app. <i>A young,</i> or <i>little, jinnee:</i> thus قُرْطُبٌ is expl. in the L: or] the <i>young ones,</i> or <i>little ones, of the jinn.</i> (K.) ―         -b6-  And <i>A young,</i> or <i>little, dog:</i> (O:) or the <i>young ones,</i> or <i>little ones, of dogs.</i> (K.) ―         -b7-  And <i>A wolf such as is termed</i> <br>\
                  اَمْعَط [i. e. <i>whose hair has fallen off, part after part,</i> or <i>has become scanty;</i> or <i>mischievous,</i> or <i>malignant</i>]. (O, K.) ―         -b8-  And An <i>ignorant</i> person, (O, K, TA,) <i>who boasts by reason of his ignorance</i> (يَظْهَرُ بِجَهْلِهِ). (O, TA.) ―         -b9-  And <i>Cowardly,</i> or <i>a coward,</i> (O, K, TA,) even if intelligent. (O, TA.) ―         -b10-  And <i>Lightwitted;</i> syn. سَفِيهٌ; (O, K, TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
      قُطْرُوبٌ: and IAar has mentioned as a pl. in this sense, used by a poet, قَطَارِيبُ, which, ISd says, may be pl. of قُطْرُوبٌ or of a sing. of some other form requiring such a form of pl., or it may be used as a pl. of قُطْرُبٌ by poetic license. (TA.) ―         -b11-  And <i>Thrown down,</i> or <i>prostrated, on the ground,</i> syn. مَصْرُوعٌ, (O, K, TA,) <i>by reason of diabolical possession</i> or <i>wrestling.</i> (O, * TA.)       -A2-  Also <i>A species of melancholia;</i> (O, K, TA;) <i>a well-known disease, arising from the black bile;</i> (TA;) <i>mostly originating in the month of</i> <br>\
                  شُبَاط [<i>February, O. S.</i>]; <i>vitiating,</i> or <i>disordering, the intellect, contracting the face, occasioning continual unhappiness, causing to wander about in the night, and rendering the face</i> <br>\
                  اَخْضَر [here app. meaning <i>of a dark,</i> or <i>an ashy, dust-colour</i>], <i>the eyes sunken, and the body emaciated.</i> (O.) [A more ample discription is given by Avicenna (Ibn-Seenà). in book iii. pp. 315, et seq. SM states that he had not found this in any other lexicon than the K. Golius explains the word as signifying <i>Lycanthropia,</i> on the authority of Rhazes (Er-Rázee).]    </entryFree> <br>\
