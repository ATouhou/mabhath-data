                   (S, TA) and قَسْوَرَةٌ, (K, TA,) the former a coll. gen. n., and the latter the n. un., (M,) <i>A certain plant,</i> (S, M, K,) <i>which grows in plain,</i> or <i>soft, land;</i> (M, K;) <i>a sour plant, of the kind called</i> <br>\

Lth is in error in saying that the former signifies a huntsman, or hunter; for it signifies a plant, as IAar and AHn and others have said.       -A2-  See also قَسْوَرَةٌ, in two places.    </entryFree> <br>\

      قَسْوَرٌ: (S, M, K:) because he overcomes and overpowers. (TA.) So in the Kur, [lxxiv. 51,] كَاَتَّهُمْ حُمُرٌ مُسْتَنْفِرَةٌ <br>\
                  فَرَّتْ مِنْ قَسْوَرَةٍ [<i>As though they were asses taking fright and running away at random that have fled from a lion</i>]. (S, M.) Or it has here the signification next following. (S.) ―         -b3-  <i>Hunters that shoot, or cast:</i> (S, K:) sing. ↓ <br>\
      قَسْوَرٌ; (K;) accord. to Lth.; [and in the M it is said that ↓ <br>\
      قَسْوَرٌ signifies <i>a shooter,</i> or <i>caster:</i> or, accord. to some, <i>a hunter:</i>] but this is a mistake; for قسورة is a coll. n., having no sing.; and Fr says, that in the verse of the Kur cited above, it means <i>shooters,</i> or <i>casters of missile weapons:</i> it is also related of &#39;Ikrimeh, that it was said to him that قسورة signifies, in the Abyssinian language, a lion; but he said that is signification is that given above on the authority of Fr, and that the lion in the Abyssinian language is called عَنْبَسَة: and Ibn-&#39;Arafeh says قسورة is of the measure فَعْوَلَةٌ from القَسْرُ; and that the meaning [in the Kur] is, as though they were asses made to take fright and run away by shooting or hunting &amp;amp;c. (TA.) Or, accord. to I&#39;Ab, in the passage above cited, it has the signification here next following. (IKt, TA.)       -A2-  The <i>sound of men,</i> (IKt, K, TA,) <i>and their voices,</i> or <i>cries.</i> (IKt, TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
