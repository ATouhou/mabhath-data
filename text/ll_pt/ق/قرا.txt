                  ,] inf. n. قُرْا=نٌ, <i>He collected together the thing; put it,</i> or <i>drew it, together;</i> (S, O, K, TA;) <i>part to part,</i> or <i>portion to portion.</i> (S, O, TA.) [This seems to be generally regarded as the primary signification.] ―         -b2-  Hence the saying of the Arabs, مَا قَرَاَتْ هٰذِهِ النَّاقَةُ سَلًى قَطُّ and مَا قَرَاَتْ جِنِينًا, meaning <i>This she-camel has not contracted her womb upon a young one:</i> (S, O, TA:) but most say that the meaning is, <i>her womb has not comprised,</i> or <i>enclosed, a fœtus:</i> or the former saying means <i>she has not borne a fœtus:</i> accord. to AHeyth, this same saying and مَا قَرَاَتْ <br>\
                  مَلْقُوحًا are both said to mean, by some, <i>she has not borne in her womb a young one (??):</i> and by some, <i>she has not let fall a young one, ever;</i> i. e. <i>she has not been pregnant:</i> and accord. to ISh, one says, ↓ <br>\
      ضَرَبَ الفَحْلُ النَّاقَةَ عَلَى غَيْرِ قَرْءٍ [which seems to mean <i>The stallion covered the she-camel without her bringing forth,</i> or <i>becoming pregnant;</i> for he adds that قرء الناقة means ضعتها; app. ضَعَتُهَا or ضِعَتُهَا; but I have not found ضَعَةٌ nor ضِعَةٌ among the inf. ns. of وَضَعَتْ meaning “ she brought forth; ” and I rather think that the right reading is ضَغَنُهَا or ضِغْنُهَا, and that the meaning therefore is, <i>without her inclining,</i> or <i>being desirous:</i> see 10, third sentence; and see قَرْءُ الفَرَسِ]: and there is another saying; that لَمْ تَقْرَاْ جَنِينًا means <i>She has not,</i> or <i>did not, cast forth a fœtus,</i> or <i>a young one.</i> (TA.) One says also, of the she-camel, (K, TA,) and of the ewe, or she-goat, (TA,) قَرَاَتْ, alone, meaning <i>She became pregnant:</i> (K, TA:) and likewise, of the pregnant [in general], or of the she-camel, accord. to different copies of the K, (TA,) meaning <i>she brought forth:</i> (K, TA:) ISh says that قَرَاَتْ is used in relation to a she-camel; and ↓ <br>\
      اَقْرَاَتْ, in relation to a woman: [each, app., in the former sense and in the latter:] and that one says ↓ <br>\
      نَاقَةٌ قَارِيٌ; pl. نُوقٌ قَوَارِيُ. (TA.) ―         -b3-  See also 4.       -A2-  قَرَاَ الكِتَابِ, (S, O, Msb, * K, *) and بِهِ, (Msb, * K,) the verb being trans. by itself and by means of ب, or this particle is redundant, (Msb,) and sometimes the ء is suppressed, so that one says [قَرَى and] قَرَيْتُ &amp;amp;c., (TA,) aor.      <br>\
                     قَرَاَ<br>\

                  , (K,) the latter aor. on the authority of Ez-Zejjájee, as is said in the L, but generally ignored, (TA,) inf. n. قِرَا=ءَةٌ and قُرْا=نٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and قَرْءٌ, (Msb, K,) this last mentioned by Az; (Msb;) and ↓ <br>\
      اقتراهُ; (K;) <i>He read</i> [<i>the book,</i> or <i>Scripture</i>], or <i>recited</i> [<i>it</i>]: (K, TA:) or قَرَاْتُ القُرْا=نَ means [properly, or etymologically, accord. to some,] <i>I uttered</i> [<i>the words of</i>] <i>the Kur-án in a state of combination</i> [or <i>uninterruptedly</i>]; (O, TA;) as Ktr is related to have said: (O:) [or قَرَاَ as used in a case of this kind app. signifies properly <i>he read,</i> or <i>recited,</i> the Scripture <i>chanting;</i> like as اَنْشَدَ properly signifies “ he recited ” poetry “ chanting with a high voice: ” (for Scripture and poetry are usually chanted:) then, <i>he read,</i> or <i>recited,</i> anything <i>in any manner,</i> without, or from, or in, a book.] It is said in a trad., مَنْ اَرَادَ اَنْ يَقْرَاَ <br>\
                  القُرْا=نَ غَضًّا كَمَا اُنْزِلَ فَلْيَقْرَاْهُ قِرَا=ءَةَ اُمِّ عَبْدٍ [He who desires to read, or recite, <i>the Kur-án freshly, like as it was revealed, let him read,</i> or <i>recite, it in the manner of Ibn-Umm-&#39;Abd</i>]; meaning فَلْيُرَنِّلْ <br>\
                  كَتَرْتِيلِهِ [properly, <i>let him read,</i> or <i>recite, in a leisurely manner, with distinct utterance, and with moderation;</i> but conventionally, <i>let him chant, in a peculiar, distinct, and leisurely, manner; like as he did</i>]: or يُحَزِّنْ كَتَحْزِينِهِ [<i>let him read,</i> or <i>recite, with a slender and plaintive voice, like as he did</i>]: or يَحْدُرْهُ كَحَدْرِهِ [<i>let him read it,</i> or <i>recite it, quickly, like as he did</i>]. (O.) And in a trad. of I&#39;Ab, it is said, كَانَ لَا يَقْرَاُ فِى الظُّهْرِ <br>\
                  وَالعَصْرِ, meaning <i>He used not to recite</i> [the Kur- án] <i>aloud in the</i> [prayers of the] <i>noon and the</i> [period of the afternoon called the] عْصر: or <i>he used not to make himself to hear his reciting:</i> as though he heard persons reciting and making themselves and those near them to hear. (TA.) The saying, in the Kur [lxxv. 17 and 18], اـِنَّ <br>\
                  عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ وَقُرْا=نَهُ فَاـِذَا قَرَاْنَاهُ فَاْتَّبِع قُرْا=نَهُ means <i>Verily on us is the collecting thereof</i> [i. e. of the Kur-án] <i>and the reciting thereof; and when we recite it, then follow thou the reciting thereof:</i> or, accord. to I&#39;Ab, <i>and when we explain it to thee, then do thou according to that which we have explained to thee:</i> (S, O, TA:) or the meaning [signified and implied] is, <i>verily on us is the collecting thereof</i> in thy mind, <i>and the fixing the recitation thereof on thy tongue; and when we recite it</i> to thee by the tongue of Gabriel, <i>then follow thou the reciting thereof,</i> and often recur therein so that it may become firmly rooted in thy understanding: (Bd:) [therefore قُرْا=نَهُ in the former instance means <i>the teaching</i> thee <i>to recite it;</i> and thus we may explain the assertion that] قَرَاَ and ↓ <br>\
      اَقْرَاَ are syn. in like manner as are عَلَا قِرْنَهُ and استعلاهُ. (Sb, TA.) See 4. قَرَاَ عَلَيْهِ means <i>He read,</i> or <i>recited, to him</i> the Kur-án, &amp;amp;c., [<i>as a teacher,</i> or <i>an informant;</i> (as is shown by phrases in the Kur xxvi. 199 and lxxxiv. 21;) like تَلَا عَلَيْهِ: and also, as a conventional and post-classical phrase,] <i>as a pupil,</i> or <i>learner, to his sheykh,</i> or <i>preceptor.</i> (L.) قَرَاَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامَ and السَّلَامَ ↓ <br>\
      اَقْرَاَهُ are syn., (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) signifying <i>He conveyed,</i> or <i>delivered, to him the salutation:</i> or the latter phrase is not used unless the salutation is written: (K, TA:) or belongs to a particular dial.; and is used when the salutation is written, meaning <i>he made him to read the salutation:</i> (AHát, TA:) the aor. of the verb in the former phrase is      <br>\
                     قَرَاَ<br>\
                  , and the inf. n. is قِرَا=ءَةٌ: As says that the making that verb trans. by itself is a mistake; therefore one should not say اِقْرَاْهُ <br>\
                  السَّلَامَ [meaning <i>Convey thou,</i> or <i>deliver thou, to him, salutation</i>]. (Msb.) ―         -b2-  See also 5.       -A3-  And see 4, first quarter.    </entryFree> <br>\

                  , said of a woman: see 1, former half. Said of a she-camel, (K, TA,) and of a ewe, or she-goat, (TA,) <i>She retained the seed of the male in her womb:</i> (K, TA:) and when this is the case, one says that she is فى قِرْوَتِهَا, which is anomalous, for ↓ <br>\
      فى قِرْاَتِهَا; (TA in the present art.;) meaning <i>in the first period of her pregnancy, before its becoming apparent,</i> or <i>manifest.</i> (TA in art. قرو.) [And accord. to Freytag, (app. in the phrase اَقْرَاَتْ سَمًّا,) the verb is expl. in the Kitáb el-Addád as said of a serpent, meaning <i>It retained</i> poison <i>for the space of a month.</i>] ―         -b2-  Also, said of a woman, <i>She menstruated:</i> and <i>she became pure from the menstrual discharge:</i> (S, O, * Msb, K, TA:) and so ↓ <br>\
      قَرَاَتْ, in both of these senses, (Msb, TA,) aor.      <br>\

                  , inf. n. قَرْءٌ; (Msb;) or in the former sense; (Akh, S, K;) and [accordingly] one says, قَرَاَتْ حَيْضَةً اَوْ حَيْضَتَيْنِ [so in copies of the S, agreeably with what immediately precedes, but in one of my copies of the S and in the O and TA, اَقْرَاَت, meaning, <i>she menstruated once or twice</i>]; (S, O, * TA; *) and قَرَاَتْ signifies <i>she saw the blood</i> [<i>of the menses app. for the first time</i>]: (TA:) and اَقْرَاَتْ signifies <i>she became one who had the menstrual discharge.</i> (Akh, S, O, TA.) [Accord. to Zj, as I gather from the TA, the second of the significations in the sentence immediately preceding is from the collection of the blood in the womb: in the opinion of IAth, it and the first signification are from relation to time: but I rather incline to think that the converse of this is the case, and that hence are deduced several other meanings here following.] ―         -b3-  اقرات الرِّيَاحُ (S, K) <i>The winds blew,</i> (K,) or <i>began</i> [<i>to blow</i>], (S,) <i>in their time,</i> or <i>season.</i> (S, K.) ―         -b4-  اقرا (said of a man, O, TA) <i>He reverted,</i> or <i>turned back,</i> (O, K, TA,) from his journey.

(TA.) ―         -b9-  اَقْرَاْتُ فِى الشِّعْرِ is from الاَقْرَا=ءُ [pl. of القَرْءُ or القُرْءُ: hence it seems to mean <i>I rhymed,</i> or <i>versified:</i> compare اَرْجَزَ from الرَّجَزُ, and اَرْمَلَ from الرَّمَلُ, &amp;amp;c.].
