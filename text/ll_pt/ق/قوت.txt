      قَاتَ] are one [in signification]; and AM says that the meaning of this is, [<i>No, by</i>] <i>Him who takes my spirit, breath after breath, until He has taken it wholly,</i> [<i>the All-seeing, I did not</i> that thing:] and the saying of Tufeyl means <i>the saddle,</i> while I am riding upon it, <i>takes by little and little the fat of her hump until there remains not of it aught.</i> (TA.) ―         -b4-  One says also, الحَرْبُ تَقْتَاتُ الاـِبِلَ (tropical:)  [<i>War makes the camels to be food</i>]; meaning that [in consequence of war] the camels are given in payment of bloodwits.

I shall know what evil I have done; for [as is said in the Kur lxxv. 14] man shall be a witness against himself: (S, O, TA:) IB says that, accord. to Seer, the correct reading is, رَبِّى على الحساب مقيت [meaning <i>my Lord is able to make the reckoning</i>] because he who is submissive to his Lord does not describe himself by this epithet: but IB adds that Seer has founded this remark upon the assumption that مقيت is here used as meaning مُقْتَدِرٌ; and that if it be understood as syn. with حَافِظٌ and شَاهِدٌ, the former reading is not objectionable.

It is said in the Kur [iv. 87], وَكَانَ اْللّٰهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ مُقِيتًا, (S, O,) meaning [<i>For God is</i>] <i>a possessor of power</i> [<i>over everything,</i> or <i>is omnipotent</i>], (Ksh, Bd, Jel,) so He will requite everyone for what he has done: (Jel:) or <i>a witness,</i> [and] <i>a preserver,</i> or <i>protector,</i> or <i>watcher.</i> (Ksh, Bd.)   </entryFree> <br>\
