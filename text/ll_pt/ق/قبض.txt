                  اَجَذَهُ [<i>he took it</i> in any manner: <i>he took it with his hand: he took possession of it:</i> and <i>he received it</i>]: (S, M, Mgh, Msb:) and قَبَضَ عَلَيْهِ, and بِهِ, (M,) or قَبَضَ عَلَيْهِ بِيَدَهِ, (A, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (M,) <i>he grasped it, clutched it, laid hold upon it,</i> or <i>seized it, with his hand;</i> syn. اَمْسَكَهُ: (A, K:) or <i>he seized it</i> (اَنْحَى عَلَيْهِ) <i>with the whole of his hand:</i> (M:) or <i>he closed,</i> or <i>contracted, his fingers upon it:</i> (Mgh, Msb:) it is also said, by MF, that some assert قَبْضٌ to signify the “ taking with the ends of the fingers; ” but this is a mistranscription, for قَبْضٌ, with the unpointed ص. (TA [in which it is said, in another place in this art., that ↓ <br>\
      تَقْبِيضٌ has also this last signification; but this is evidently, in like manner, a mistranscription, for تَقْبِيضٌ.]) You say, قَبَضَ المَتَاعَ [<i>He took,</i> or <i>received, the commodity,</i> or <i>the commodities,</i> or <i>goods</i>]. (A.) And قَبَضَ مِنْهُ الدَّيْنَ [<i>He took,</i> or <i>received, from him the debt</i>]. (M, K, in art. قضى; &amp;amp;c.).

(A.) ―         -b2-  It is also used metaphorically, to denote the having an absolute property in a thing, to dispose of it at pleasure, without respect to the hand; as in the phrase قَبَضْتُ الاَرْضَ, and الدَّارَ, (tropical:)  <i>I had,</i> or <i>took,</i> or <i>got, possession of the land,</i> and <i>of the house.</i> (TA.) And [in like manner] it is said in a trad., يَقْبِضُ اْللّٰهُ الاَرْضَ, and السَّمَا=ءَ, (assumed tropical:)  <i>God will comprehend,</i> or <i>collect together,</i> [<i>within his sole possession,</i> (see قُبْضَةٌ,)] <i>the earth,</i> and <i>the heaven.</i> (TA.)

And قَبَضْتُهُ عَنِ الاَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>I removed him from the thing,</i> or <i>affair.</i> (Msb.) ―         -b3-  قَبَضَهُ, aor. as above, (M, K,) and so the inf. n., (S, M, Mgh,) also signifies the (assumed tropical:)  <i>contr. of</i> <br>\

And قَبَضَ كَفَّهُ [<i>He clenched his hand</i>]. (S, Mgh, Msb, K, in art. برجم.). And قَبَضَ يَدَهُ عَنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>He drew in his hand from it:</i> or] <i>he refrained from laying hold upon it.</i> (K.) Whence the saying in the Kur, [ix. 68,] وَيَقْبِضُونَ اَيْدِيَهُمْ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [<i>And they draw in their hands,</i> or <i>refrain,</i>] from expenditure, or from paying the [poor-rate called] زَكَاة.

                  جَنَاحَهُ, (assumed tropical:)  <i>he contracted his wing to fly.</i> (TA.) And hence, (TA,) قَبَضَ, aor. as above; (S, K;) or قَبُضَ (M;) [or both;] inf. n.

(S, K. *) You say also, قَبَضَتِ الاـِبِلُ (tropical:)  <i>The camels were quick in their pace; at every spring therein, putting their legs together.</i> (A.) And ↓ <br>\

                  حَاجَتِهِ (tropical:)  <i>Such a one was quick, and light,</i> or <i>active, in accomplishing his want.</i> (A.) And قَبْضٌ also signifies <i>i. q.</i> <br>\

You say, قَبَضَ اْللّٰهُ الرِزْقَ, aor. and inf. n. as first mentioned, (assumed tropical:)  <i>God straitened, scanted,</i> or <i>made scanty, the means of subsistence.</i> (Msb.)

(Jel.) ―         -b7-  [As such also, (assumed tropical:)  <i>He abridged his liberty.</i>] You say, فُلَانٌ يَبْسُطُ غَبِيدَهُ ثُمَّ يَقْبِضُهُمْ (tropical:)  [<i>Such a one enlarges the liberty of his slaves; then abridges their liberty</i>]. (A.) ―         -b8-  [As such also, (tropical:)  <i>He,</i> or <i>it, contracted his heart;</i> i. e. <i>distressed him; grieved him.</i>] You say, اـِنَّهُ يَقْبِضُنِى مَا يَقْبِضُكَ <br>\

(TA.) Or the phrase اـِنَّهُ لَيَقْبِضُنِى مَا قَبَضَكَ, mentioned by Lth, means (assumed tropical:)  <i>Verily what hath annoyed and angered thee annoys and angers me.</i> (Az, TA.) قَبْضٌ and بَسْطٌ are terms applied by the investigators of truth among the Soofees to two contrary states of the heart, from both of which it is seldom or never free: the former being an affection of the heart withholding it from dilatation and joy; whether the cause thereof be known, as the remembrance of a sin or an offence, or of an omission, or be not known; and some of them make other divisions thereof. (TA.) [In like manner] you say also, عَنَّا فَمَا قَبَضَكَ ↓ <br>\
