                  <i>He made his</i> [meaning his own] <i>breast,</i> or <i>chest, to stick out.</i> (A.) ―         -b2-  <i>He drew back, and became refractory, and made himself like him who has a hollow,</i> or <i>receding, back, and a protruding,</i> or <i>protuberant, breast,</i> or <i>chest.</i> (Har, p. 17.) ―         -b3-  (assumed tropical:)  <i>He drew back; held back;</i> or <i>hung back.</i> (S, K.) You say, تقاعس عَنِ الاَمْرِ (tropical:)  <i>He drew back, held back,</i> or <i>hung back, from the thing,</i> or <i>affair, and would not go forward in it;</i> (S, TA;) as also ↓ <br>\
      قَعِسَ, inf. n. قَعَسٌ; and ↓ <br>\
      تقعّس: (TA:) in some copies of the S, instead of تقاعس, in this phrase, we find ↓ <br>\

      اِقْعَنْسَسَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He drew back; he receded,</i> or <i>went backwards.</i> (S, K.) When a man draws water without a pulley, pulling the rope at the head of the well, his back pains him, and it is said to him, وَاْجْذِبِ الدَّلْوَ ↓ <br>\
      اِقْعَنْسِسْ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Go thou backwards, and pull the bucket</i>]. This verb is without idghám because it is quasi-coördinate to اِحْرَنْجَمَ. (S.) ―         -b4-  (assumed tropical:)  <i>He</i> (a horse, S, K) <i>drew back,</i> or <i>held back, and would not go forward:</i> (S:) or <i>would not submit to his leader;</i> (K;) [as also ↓ <br>\

(TA.) Hence the saying, اِبْنُ خَمْسٍ عَشَا=ءُ خَلِفَاتٍ قُعْسٍ, meaning, <i>The</i> tarrying of the moon <i>five nights old</i> until it sets is like the tarrying during the <i>evening feed of pregnant camels having their heads and necks inclining towards their backs.</i> (S, TA.)
