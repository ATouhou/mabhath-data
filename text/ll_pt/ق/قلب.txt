                     قَلِبَ<br>\
                  , (Msb, K.) inf. n. قَلْبٌ, (Msb,) <i>He altered,</i> or <i>changed, its,</i> or <i>his, mode,</i> or <i>manner, of being;</i> (A, Mgh, Msb, * K;) and ↓ <br>\
      قلّبهُ signifies the same, (K,) or is like قَلَبَهُ in the sense expl. above and in other senses but denotes intensiveness and muchness; (Msb;) and ↓ <br>\
      اقلبهُ also signifies the same as قَلَبَهُ in the sense expl. above, (K,) on the authority of Lh, but is of weak authority. (TA.) Hence, (Mgh,) <i>He inverted it; turned it upside-down; turned it so as to make its upper most part its undermost;</i> (S, * A, * Mgh, Msb;) namely, a thing; (S;) for instance, a [garment of the kind called] رِدَا=ء: (A, * Mgh:) and ↓ <br>\
      قلّبهُ has a similar meaning, but [properly] denotes intensiveness and muchness. (Msb. See two exs. of the latter verb voce قَلَبَةٌ.) And, (A, K,) like ↓ <br>\
      قلّبهُ, [except that the latter properly denotes intensiveness and muchness,] (K,) it signifies حَوَّلَهُ ظَهْرًا <br>\
                  لِبَطْنٍ (A, K) [<i>He turned it over,</i> or <i>upsidedown</i> as meaning <i>so that the upper side became the under side;</i> lit. <i>back for belly;</i> accord. to the TA, meaning <i>back upon belly</i> (ظَهْرًا عَلَى بَطْنٍ); but this is hardly conceivable; whereas the former explanation is obviously right in another case: (see 5:) and another meaning of قَلَبَهُ and ↓ <br>\
      قُلبهُ, i. e. <i>he turned it inside-out,</i> is indicated in the TA by its being added, <i>so that he knew what was in it</i>]. ―         -b2-  See an ex. voce قَلَابِ. One says, قَلَبَ كَلَامًا [meaning <i>He altered,</i> or <i>changed, the order of the words of a sentence</i> or <i>the like, by inversion,</i> or <i>by any transposition</i>]. (TA.) [And in like manner, قَلَبَ كَلِمَةً <br>\
                  <i>He altered,</i> or <i>changed, the order of the letters of a word, by inversion,</i> or <i>by any transposition.</i>] Es-Sakháwee says, in the Expos. of the Mufassal, that when they transpose [the letters of a word], they do not assign to the [transformed] derivative an inf. n., lest it should be confounded with the original, using only the inf. n. of the original that it may be an evidence of the originality [of the application of the latter to denote the signification common to both]: thus they say يَيِسَ, inf. n. يَاْسٌ; and اَيِسَ is مِنْهُ ↓ <br>\
      مَقْلُوبٌ [i. e. <i>formed by transposition,</i> or <i>metathesis, from it</i>], and has no inf. n.: when the two inf. ns. exist, the grammarians decide that each of the two verbs is [to be regarded as] an original, and that neither is مقلوب from the other, as in the case of جَذَبَ and جَبَذَ: but the lexicologists [in general] assert that all such are [of the class termed] مقلوب. (Mz, close of the 33rd نوع.) [And قَلَبَ likewise signifies <i>He changed,</i> or <i>converted,</i> a letter <i>into</i> another letter; the verb in this sense being doubly trans.: for ex., one says, قَلَبَ الوَاوَ <br>\
                  يَا=ءً <br>\
                  <i>He changed,</i> or <i>converted, the</i> <br>\
                  و <br>\
                  <i>into</i> <br>\
                  ى.] ―         -b3-  And [hence] one says, قَلَبَهُ عَنْ وَجْهِهِ (assumed tropical:)  <i>He turned him</i> [<i>from his manner, way,</i> or <i>course,</i> of acting, or proceeding, &amp;amp;c.]: and Lh has mentioned ↓ <br>\
      اقلبهُ [in the same sense], but as being disapproved. (TA.) And قَلَبَ الصِّبْيَانَ (tropical:)  <i>He</i> (the teacher) <i>turned away</i> [or <i>dismissed</i>] the boys to their dwellings: (Th, A, TA:) or <i>sent them</i> [<i>away</i>], <i>and returned them, to their abodes:</i> and Lh has mentioned ↓ <br>\
      اقلبهم as a dial. var. of weak authority, saying that the former verb is that which is used by the Arabs in this and other [similar] cases. (TA.) And قَلَبْتُ القَوْمَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>I turned away</i> [or <i>dismissed</i>] <i>the people,</i> or <i>party;</i> (Th, S, O;) like as you say صَرَفْتُ الصِّبْيَانَ. (Th, S.) And قَلَبَ اْللّٰهُ فُلَانًا اـِلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>God translated such a one unto Himself, by death:</i> meaning <i>God took his soul</i>]; as also ↓ <br>\
      اقلبه; (K, TA;) whence the saying of Anooshirwán, اْللّٰهُ مُقْلَبَ اَوْلِيَايِهِ ↓ <br>\
      اَقْلَبَكُمُ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>May God translate you with the translating of his favourites</i> (مقلب being here an inf. n.), meaning, as He translates his favourites]. (TA.) ―         -b4-  And قَلَبَ عَيْنَهُ, and حِمْلَاقَهُ, (TA,) or حِمْلَاقَ عَيْنِهِ, (A,) [<i>He turned about,</i> or <i>rolled, his eye,</i> and therefore <i>the parts of his eye that are occasionally covered by the eyelids,</i>] on the occasion of anger, (A, TA,) and of threatening. (TA.) ―         -b5-  قَلَبَ, aor.      <br>\
                     قَلِبَ<br>\
                  , inf. n. قَلْبٌ; and ↓ <br>\
      اقلب likewise, but this is of weak authority, mentioned by Lh; signify also <i>He turned over</i> bread, and the like, when the upper part thereof was thoroughly baked, in order that the under side might become so. (TA.) And you say, قَلَبْتُ الاـِنَا=ءَ عَلَى رَاْسِهِ [<i>I turned over the vessel upon its head</i>]. (Msb, in explanation of كَبَبْتُ الاـِنَا=ءَ.) And قَلَبْتُ الاَرْضَ لِلزِّرَاعَةِ [<i>I turned over the earth for sowing</i>]: and ↓ <br>\
      قَلَّبْتُهَا, also, I did so <i>much.</i>] (Msb.) And يُقْلَبُ التُّرَابُ <br>\
                  بِالحَفْرِ [<i>The earth is turned over in digging</i>]: whence قَلَبْتُ قَلِيبًا means <i>I dug a well.</i> (A.) ―         -b6-  And [hence also] one says, قَلَبْتُ الشَّىْءَ لِلْاِبْتِيَاعِ <br>\
                  <i>I turned over the thing,</i> or (assumed tropical:)  <i>I examined the several parts,</i> or <i>portions, of the thing,</i> (تَصَفَّحْتُهُ,) [or <i>I turned over the thing for the purpose of examining it,</i>] <i>with a view to purchasing, and saw its outer part</i> or <i>side, and its inner part</i> or <i>side:</i> and ↓ <br>\
      قَلَّبْتُهُ, also, I did so <i>much.</i> (Msb.) And قَلَبَ السِّلْعَةَ (tropical:)  <i>He</i> (a trafficker) <i>examined the commodity, and scrutinized its condition:</i> and ↓ <br>\
      قَلَّبَهَا, also, he did so [<i>much</i>]. (A.) And قَلَبَ الدَّابَّةَ and الغُلَامَ (tropical:)  [<i>He examined,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>the beast,</i> or <i>horse,</i> or <i>the like,</i> and <i>the youth,</i> or <i>young man,</i> or <i>male slave</i>]: (A:) and قَلَبَ <br>\

And قَلَبْتُ الاَمْرَ ظَهْرًا لِبَطْنٍ (assumed tropical:)  <i>I considered</i> [or <i>turned over in my mind</i>] <i>what might be the issues,</i> or <i>results, of the affair,</i> or <i>case:</i> and ↓ <br>\
      قَلَّبْتُهُ, also, I did so <i>much.</i> (Msb.)       -A2-  قَلَبٌ signifies اِنْقِلابٌ, (S, A, O, K, TA,) meaning <i>A turning outward,</i> (TK,) <i>and being flabby,</i> (TA,) of the lip, (S, A, O, K,) or of the upper lip, (TA,) of a man: (S, A, O, K, TA:) it is the inf. n. of قَلِبَت said of the lip (الشَّفَةُ); (TA;) [and also, accord. to the TK, of قَلِبَ said of a man as meaning <i>His lip had what is termed</i> <br>\
                  قَلَبٌ:] and hence ↓ <br>\
      اَقْلَبُ as an epithet applied to a man; and [its fem.] ↓ <br>\
      قَلْبَا=ء as an epithet applied to a lip. (S, A, O, K, TA.)       -A3-  قَلَبَهُ, (S, A, O, K,) aor.      <br>\

                  فِى اليَدِ. (Ksh.) ―         -b3-  [تَقْلِيبُ المَالِ لِغَرَضِ الرِّبْحِ occurs in the A, in art. تجر, as an explanation of التِّجَارَةُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>The employing of property,</i> or <i>turning it to use, in various ways, for the purpose of gain.</i>] And you say, قَلَّبْتُهُ فِى الاَمْرِ, meaning صَرَّفْتُهُ [i. e.

                   The <i>heart;</i> syn. فُوَادٌ: (Lh, T, S, M, O, Msb, K, &amp;amp;c.:) or [accord. to some] it has a more special signification than the latter word: (O, K:) [for] some say that فواد signifies the “ appendages of the مَرِىْء [or œsophagus], consisting of the liver and lungs and قَلْب [or heart]: ” (K in art. فاد:) [and, agreeably with this assertion,] it is said that the قلب is <i>a lump of flesh, pertaining to the</i> <br>\
                  فواد, <i>suspended to the</i> <br>\
                  نِيَاط [q. v.]: Az says, I have observed that some of the Arabs call the whole flesh of the قلب, its fat, and its حِجَاب [or septum?], قَلْب and فُوَاد; and I have not observed them to distinguish between the two [words]; but I do not deny that the [word] قلب may be [applied by some to] the <i>black clot of blood in its interior:</i> MF mentions that فواد is said to signify the “ receptacle, ” or “ covering, ” of the heart, (وِعَا=ءُ القَلْبِ, or غِشَاوُهُ, [i. e. the pericardium,]) or, accord. to some, its “ interior: ” the قَلْب is said to be so called from its تَقَلُّب: [see 5:] the word is of the masc. gender: and the pl. is قُلُوبٌ. (TA.) بَنَاتُ القَلْبِ means (assumed tropical:)  <i>The several parts,</i> or <i>portions,</i> [or, perhaps, <i>appertenances,</i>] <i>of the heart.</i> (TA in art. بنى.) [And قَلْبٌ is also used as meaning The <i>stomach,</i> which is often thus termed in the present day: so, for ex., in an explanation of طَنِخ, q. v.] ―         -b2-  قَلْبُ العَقْرَبِ (also called simply, القَلْبُ, Kzw) is (assumed tropical:)  <i>A certain bright star,</i> [<i>the star a in Scorpio,</i>] <i>between two other stars,</i> which is <i>one of the Mansions of the Moon,</i> (S, O,) namely, <i>the Eighteenth Mansion;</i> so called because it is in the heart of Scorpio: (MF:) [it rose aurorally, about the commencement of the era of the Flight, in Central Arabia, together with النَّسْرُ الوَقِعُ (a of Libra) on the 25th of November, O. S.: (see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل:)] the commencement of the period when the cattle breed in the desert is at the time of its [auroral] rising and the [auroral] rising of النسر الواقع; these two stars rising together, in the cold season: the Arabs say, القَلبْ جَا=ءَ الشِّتَا=ءُ كَاْلْكَلْبْ [<i>When the heart</i> of the Scorpion <i>rises, the winter comes like the dog</i>]: and they regard its نَوْء [q. v.] as unlucky; and dislike journeying when the moon is in Scorpio: at its نَوْء [meaning auroral rising], the cold becomes vehement, cold winds blow, and the sap becomes stagnant in the trees: its رَقِيب is الدَّبَرَانُ [q. v.] (Kzw.) There are also three similar appellations of other stars: these are قَلْبُ الاَسَدِ (assumed tropical:)  [<i>Cor Leonis,</i> or <i>Regulus, the star a of Leo</i>]: قَلْبُ الثَّوْرِ, an [improper] appellation of الدَّبَرَانُ: and قَلْبُ الحُوتِ, a name of الرِّشَا=ءُ [q. v.].
