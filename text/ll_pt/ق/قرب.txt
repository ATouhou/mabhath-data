(Msb.) And the Arabs say, of a man, when a thing has disquieted, or disturbed, and grieved, him, اَخَذَهُ مَا قَرُبَ وَمَا بَعُدَ, as though meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>He became,</i> or <i>has become, disquieted by reason of near and remote circumstances of his case:</i> (O:) or <i>recent and old griefs took hold upon him.</i> (Mgh in art. قدم.

                  الوَعْدُ [in the Kur xxi. 97] signifies تقارب [meaning <i>And the fulfilment of the promise shall draw near</i>]: (S, O, TA:) and you say, اقترب مِنِّى [meaning <i>He drew near to me</i>]: (A:) it is also said that is has a more particular signification than قَرُبَ; for it denotes intensiveness in القُرْب; thus says Ibn-&#39;Arafeh; probably meaning that it denotes labour and difficulty in the accomplishment of the act. (MF, TA.) ↓ <br>\
      تقرّب [likewise] is <i>syn. with</i> [قَرُبَ, i. e.] دَنَا, in the phrase تقرّب مِنْهُ: (O: [see قَرُبَ مِنْهُ:]) or it signifies <i>he drew near,</i> or <i>approached, by little and little,</i> (تَدَنَّى,) to a thing. (TA.) And الشَّىْءَ ↓ <br>\

                  , inf. n. قُرْبٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  <i>He formed an opinion that was near to certainty.</i> (MF.) ―         -b3-  In the phrase قَرَبَتِ <br>\
                  الشَّمْسُ لِلْمَغِيبِ [meaning <i>The sun was,</i> or <i>became, near to setting</i>], like كَرَبَت, the ق is asserted by Yaakoob to be a substitute for ك. (TA.)       -A2-  قَرَبَ, aor.      <br>\

                     قَرُبَ<br>\

                  , inf. n. قَرَبٌ, so in the Fs [of Th, meaning <i>I journeyed to the water by night in order to reach it on the following morning</i>]. (TA.) [Or] you say, قَرَبُوا المَا=ءَ, meaning <i>They sought,</i> or <i>sought to attain, the water.</i> (A.) ―         -b3-  And [hence] one says, فُلَانٌ يَقْرُبُ حَاجَتُهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  <i>Such a one seeks,</i> or <i>seeks to attain, the object of his want;</i> from the seeking, or seeking to attain, the water: and hence the saying, in a trad., وَاـِنْ نَقْرُبُ بِذٰلِكَ اـِلَّا اَنْ نَحْمَدَ اْللّٰهَ (assumed tropical:)  <i>We not seeking thereby</i> [aught] <i>save our praising God:</i> thus expl. by El-Khattábee. (Az, TA.) [Hence, also,] one says قَدْ قَرَبَ اَمْرًا لَا اَدْرِى مَا هُوَ (tropical:)  [<i>He has sought to accomplish an affair, I know not what it is</i>]: (A, O: *) and فُلَانٌ يَقْرُبُ اَمْرًا لَا <br>\

                  قِرَاب: (S, K, TA:) or ↓ the latter has both of these significations: (O:) or the former verb is said of a sword or of a knife in the former sense; and in like manner ↓ the latter verb in the latter sense: or the former phrase signifies <i>he made for the sword a</i> <br>\
                  قِرَاب; and ↓ the latter phrase, <i>he put the sword into its</i> <br>\

                  قُرْبَان, i. e. [a <i>near associate,</i> or] <i>a consessor,</i> or <i>a particular,</i> or <i>special, associate</i> or <i>companion</i> [&amp;amp;c.: see قُرْبَانٌ]. (TA.) ―         -b3-  قَرَّبَهُ اـِلَيْهِمْ, in the Kur li. 27, means <i>He presented it,</i> or <i>offered it, to them:</i> (Jel:) or <i>he placed it,</i> or <i>put it, before them.</i> (Bd.)

Thus what is termed تَصْغِيرُ التَّقْرِيبِ [<i>The diminutive denoting nearness</i>] is such as occurs in the saying, دَارِى قُبَيْلَ المَسْجِدِ [“ My house is a little before the mosque ”].
