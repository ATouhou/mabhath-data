                  , signifying حَسْبُ, [explained in exs. here following,] (Lth, S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K,) i. e., (S,) denoting the being satisfied, or content, (Sb, S, M, Msb,) with a thing, (Msb,) is thus written, with fet-h to the ق, and with the ط quiescent, (Sb, S, M, Msb, * Mughnee,) like عَنْ; (K;) and also, (Sb, M, K,) sometimes, (Sb, M,) ↓ <br>\
      قَطٍ, (Sb, M, K,) with tenween, mejroor; (K;) and ↓ <br>\
      قَطِى [distinguished from قَطِى in the next sentence]; (Sb, M, K;) but the term “ mejroor ” is here used contr. to the rules of grammar, as it denotes that قط is decl., whereas it is not. (MF.) It is used as a prefixed noun: you say, قَطْكَ هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ <br>\
                  <i>Thy sufficiency</i> [meaning <i>sufficient for thee</i>] <i>is this thing;</i> syn. حَسْبُكَ; (Lth, S, Mughnee; *) and like it is قَدْ: (Lth:) and you also say, using it as a prefixed n., قَطْنِى <br>\
                  <i>My sufficiency;</i> syn. حَسْبِى; (Lth, S, * Mughnee;) like قَدْنِى; introducing ن, (Lth, S, TA,) as in عَنِّى and مِنِّى and لَدُنِّى, contr. to rule, for the reason which has been explained in treating of قَدْ, (S, TA,) to preserve the original quiescence of the ط; (Mughnee;) and قَطِى; (S, Msb, Mughnee;) and ↓ <br>\
      قَطِ; (S;) and ↓ <br>\
      قَطَاطِ, (S, M, K,) like قَطَامِ, (S, K,) indecl.; (M;) as signifying حَسْبِى: (S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K:) and, as is said in the Moo&#39;ab, قَطْ عَبْدِ اللّٰهِ دِرْهَمٌ <br>\
                  <i>The sufficiency of &#39;Abd-Allah is a dirhem;</i> [and the like is said by Lth and in the Mughnee;] pausing upon the ط, and making قط to govern a gen. case [as it does virtually in the preceding instances]; and the Basrees say, that this is the right mode, as meaning the like of حَسْبُ زَيْدٍ <br>\
                  دِرْهَمٌ and كَفْىَ زَيْدٍ دِرْهَمٌ: (K:) or some say قَطْ, with jezm; and some say ↓ <br>\
      قَطُ, making it inded. with damm for its termination; each governing what follows it in the gen. case. (M.) ―         -b2-  It is also a verbal noun, signifying يَكْفِى [<i>It suffices,</i> or <i>will suffice;</i> or <i>it is,</i> or <i>will be, sufficient</i>]; and when this is the case, you say, قَطْنِى, (Mughnee, K,) like as you say, يَكْفِينِى [<i>It suffices me,</i> or <i>will suffice me</i>]; (Mughnee;) or كَفَانِى [which means, emphatically, <i>it suffices me</i>], accord. to the Koofees; (Lth;) which is also allowable when قَطْ is equivalent to حَسْبُ [as we have observed above]: (Mughnee:) and you say also, قَطْكَ, meaning كَفَاكَ [emphatically <i>It suffices thee</i>]: and قَطِى, meaning كَفَانِى [emphatically <i>It suffices me</i>]: (K:) so in the copies of the K; [in the CK, erroneously, قَطَّنِى;] but [it seems that it should be قَطْنِى; for] it is said in the Mughnee and its Expositions, that in this last case the addition of the ن is indispensable: (MF:) and some say, قَطْ عَبْدَ اللّٰهِ دِرْهَمٌ [<i>A dirhem suffices,</i> or <i>will suffice, &#39;Abd-Allah</i> (in the CK, erroneously, قَطُّ)]; making it to govern the accus. case [as it does virtually in preceding instances]: and some add ن, saying, عَبْدَ اللّٰهِ دِرْهَمٌ ↓ <br>\
      قَطْنُ [meaning the same]: (Lth, K:) [hence,] some say, that [قَطْن in] قَطْنِى is a word originally thus formed without any augmentation, like [حَسْب in] حَسْبِى; (M;) [but J says,] if the ن in قَطْنِى belonged to the root of the word, they had said قَطْنُكَ, which is not known. (S.) ―         -b3-  It is also syn. with حَسْبُ in the phrase مَا رَاَيْتُهُ اـِلَّا مَرَّةً وَاحِدَةً فَقَطٌ [<i>I have not seen him,</i> or <i>it, save once, and that was a thing sufficient</i> or <i>that was enough</i>]: (S, Msb: *) or, as is said in the Mutowwel, قَطْ in فَقَطْ is a verbal noun, meaning <i>abstain thou</i> [from further questioning, or the like], as though it were the complement of a condition suppressed [such as “ the case being so ”]: or, as is said in the Mesáïl of Ibn-Es-Seed, the ف is properly prefixed because the meaning is <i>and I was satisfied,</i> or <i>content,</i> therewith; so that the ف is a conjunction: (from a marginal note in a copy of the Mughnee:) [it therefore virtually signifies <i>and no more;</i> or <i>only;</i> and thus it may often be rendered: and this explains what here follows:] when قَط is used to denote paucity, (M, K,) which is said by El-Hareeree, in the Durrah, to be only in negative phrases, (MF,) it is [written قَطْ,] with jezm, (M, K,) and without teshdeed: (M:) you say, مَا عِنْدَكَ اـِلَّا هٰذَا قَطْ [which may be rendered <i>Thou hast not save this only</i>]: but when it is followed by a conjunctive ا, it is with kesr; [as in the saying,] مَا عَلِمْتُ اـِلَّا هٰذَا قَطِ اليَوْمَ [virtually mean-  ing <i>I knew not,</i> or, emphatically, <i>know not, save this only, to-day</i>]: (K:) and also, (K,) when thus using it, (M,) you say, مَا لَهُ اـِلَّا عَشَرَةٌ قَطْ <br>\
                  يَافَتَى [likewise virtually meaning <i>He has not save ten only, O young man</i>], without teshdeed, and with jezm; and ↓ <br>\
      قَطِّ, with teshdeed and khafd; (Lh, M, K;) the kesreh of the latter, in a case of this kind, being to distinguish the قَطّ which denotes [paucity of] number from قَطُّ, which denotes time. (Lth.)       -A2-  See also قَطُّ, first sentence.    </entryFree> <br>\

                   is an adv. noun, (Mughnee,) [generally] denoting time, (S, M, Mughnee,) or past time, (Msb, K,) used to include all past time; (Lth, Mughnee;) as also ↓ <br>\

      قُطُ; (S, Mughnee, * K;) and some say ↓ <br>\

      قُطْ, (S, M, Mughnee, *) like مُذْ, which is rare: (S, M:) of all these, the first is the most chaste: (Mughnee:) when time is meant by it, it is always with refa, without tenween: (K:) or one says also ↓ <br>\
      قَطِّ, (M, Mughnee, K,) with kesr and teshdeed to the ط, (M, K,) accord. to IAar; (M;) and ↓ <br>\
      قَطَّ, with fet-h and teshdeed to the ط; (M, * K;) as well as with damm to the ط without teshdeed. (K [in some copies of which is here added, “ and with refa to the ط; ” to which is further added in the CK, “ without teshdeed: ” but I find two copies without any addition of this redundant kind: for by “ refa ” is here meant, as in a former instance, “ damm; ” though improperly, as the word is indecl.]) You say, مَا رَاَيْتُهُ قَطُّ &amp;amp;c. [<i>I have not seen him,</i> or <i>it, ever,</i> or <i>hitherto</i>]; (S, M, K;) and مَا فَعَلْتُهُ قَطَّ [<i>I have not done it ever,</i> or <i>hitherto</i>]; (Msb, Mughnee;) i. e., <i>in the time that is past;</i> (Msb, K;) or <i>in what has been cut off of my life;</i> (Mughnee, K;) its derivation being from قَطَطْتُ meaning “ I cut; ” for the past is cut off from the present and the future; and it is indecl. because it implies the meaning of مُذْ and اـِلَى; its meaning being مُذْ اَنْ خُلِقْتُ اـِلَى الا=نَ [<i>since my being created until now</i>]; and with a vowel for its termination to prevent the occurrence of two quiescent letters together; (Mughnee;) and it is with refa [meaning damm for its termination] because it is like قَبْلُ and بَعْدُ: (Lth:) accord. to Ks, (S,) قَطُّ is a contraction of قَطَطُ: (S, M:) Sb says, that it denotes الاـِنْتِهَا=ء; [app. meaning that it signifies <i>abstain thou</i> from further questioning, or the like; for El-Hareeree says, in the Durrah, that قَطُّ and قَطْ both signify the same as حَسْبُ;] and that it is indecl., with damm for its termination, like حَسْبُ. (M.) You say also, مَا فَعَلْتُ <br>\
                  هٰذَا قَطْ وَلَا قَطُّ [app. meaning <i>I have not done this alone, nor ever</i>]: (K, TA: [in the CK قَطُّ ولا قُطُ, but]) the former قط is with jezm to the ط, and the latter is with teshdeed and damm to the ط. (TA.) And يَا فَتَى ↓ <br>\
      مَا زَالَ عَلَى هٰذَا مُذْ قُطَّ [<i>He,</i> or <i>it, has not ceased to be after this manner during all past time, O young man</i>]; with damm to the ق, and with teshdeed. (Lh, M.) It is used only in negative phrases relating to past time; the saying of the vulgar لَا اَفْعَلُهُ قَطُّ [meaning <i>I will not do it ever</i>] being incorrect; (Mughnee, K; [in the CK قَطُ]) for with respect to the future you say عَوْضُ (TA) [or اَبَدًا]: or it is mostly so used, accord. to Ibn-Málik: (MF:) but it occurs after an affirmative phrase in places in El-Bukháree, (K,) in his Saheeh; (TA;) for ex., اَطْوَلُ صَلَاةٍ صَلَّيْتُهَا قَطُّ [<i>The longest prayer which I have prayed ever</i>]: and in the Sunan of Aboo-Dawood; تَوَضَّاَ ثَلَاثًا قَطُّ [<i>He performed the</i> <br>\
                  وُضُوْء <br>\
                  <i>three times ever</i>]: and Ibn-Málik asserts it to be right, and says that it is one of the things which have been unperceived by many of the grammarians: (K:) El-Karmánee, however, interprets these instances as though they were negative. (TA.)    </entryFree> <br>\
