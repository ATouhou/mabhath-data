                     ذ<br>\
                   is a noun and a particle: (S, O, Mughnee, K:) and as a noun it is used in two ways. (Mughnee, K.) ―         -b2-  (I) It is a noun <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  حَسْبُ; (S, O, Mughnee, K;) generally used indeclinably; (Mughnee, K;) thus accord. to the Basrees; with the د quiescent; (TA;) because resembling قَدْ the particle in respect of the letters composing it, and many other particles in respect of its form, (Mughnee, TA,) such as عَنْ and بَلْ &amp;amp;c.: (TA:) one says, قَدْ زَيْدٍ دِرْهَمٌ [<i>The sufficiency of Zeyd</i> (i. e. <i>what is sufficient for Zeyd</i>) <i>is a dirhem</i>], (Mughnee, K,) with the د quiescent; (Mughnee, * K, * TA;) and قَدِى (S, O) and قَدْنِى (S, O, Mughnee) [both] meaning حَسْبِى [<i>My sufficiency</i> (i. e. <i>what is sufficient for me</i>)]; (S, O;) the ن in قَدْنِى being inserted in order to preserve the quiescence [of the final letter of the noun] because this is the original characteristic of what they make indeclinable; (Mughnee;) but the insertion of the ن in this case is anomalous, for it is [by rule] only added in verbs, by way of precaution, [to prevent the confusion of the pronominal affix of the verb and that of the noun,] as in ضَرَبَنِى: (S, O:) [see, however, in the next sentence, an explanation of قَدْنِى accord. to which the ن is inserted regularly:] accord. to Yaakoob, using قَدْ in the sense of حَسْبُ, one says, مَا لَكَ عِنْدِى اـِلَّا <br>\
                  هٰذَا فَقَدْ i. e. فَقَطْ [<i>There is nothing for thee with me,</i> or <i>nothing due to thee in my possession, except this, and it is a thing sufficient,</i> or <i>it is enough,</i> <br>\
                  فَقَطْ being held to signify properly فَحَسْبُ, but it is commonly used as meaning <i>and no more</i>]; and he asserts it [i. e. قَدْ] to be a substitute [for قَطْ]: (M:) and it is also used declinably; (Mughnee, K;) thus accord. to the Koofees; (TA;) but this is rare: (Mughnee:) one says قَدُ زَيْدٍ, making it marfooa, (Mughnee, K,) like as one says حَسْبُهُ; and قَدِى without ن [as mentioned above,] like as one says حَسْبِى. (Mughnee.) ―         -b3-  (2) It is also a verbal noun, <i>syn. with</i> <br>\
                  يَكْفِى: one says, قَدْ زَيْدًا دِرْهَمٌ [<i>A dirhem suffices,</i> or <i>will suffice, Zeyd</i>], and قَدْنِى دِرْهَمٌ [<i>A dirhem suffices,</i> or <i>will suffice, me</i>]; (Mughnee, K;) like as one says يَكْفِى زَيْدًا <br>\
                  دِرْهَمٌ, and يَكْفِيْنِى دِرْهَمٌ. (Mughnee, K. *)       -A2-  As a particle, it is used peculiarly with a verb, (Mughnee, K,) [i. e.] as such it is not preposed to anything except a verb, (S, O,) either a pret. or an aor., (TA,) from which it is not separated unless by an oath, (Mughnee,) such as is perfectly inflected, enunciative, (Mughnee, K,) not an imperative, (TA,) affirmative, and free from anything that would render it mejzoom or man- soob, and from what is termed حَرْف تَنْفِيس [i. e. سَوْفُ and its variants]: and it has six meanings. (Mughnee, K.) ―         -b2-  (1) It denotes expectation: (M, Mughnee, K:) and when it is with an aor., this is evident; (Mughnee;) one says قَدْ يَقْدَمُ <br>\
                  الغَايِبُ, (Mughnee, K,) meaning <i>It is expected that the absent will come:</i> (TA:) and most affirm that it is thus used with a pret.: (Mughnee:) accord. to some, (M,) it is used in reply to the saying لَمَّا يَفْعَلْ [i. e. “ He has not yet done ” such a thing, which implies expectation that he would do it]; (S, M, O;) the reply being, قَدْفَعَلَ [<i>Already he has done</i> the thing]: (M:) and Kh asserts that it is used in reply to persons expecting information; (S, M, * O, Mughnee;) [for to such] you say, قَدْ مَاتَ فَلَانٌ [<i>Already such a one has died</i>]; but if one inform him who does not expect it, he does not say thus, but he says [merely] مَاتَ فُلَانٌ: (S, O:) thus some say قَدْ رَكِبَ الاَمِيرُ [<i>Already the commander has mounted</i> his horse] to him who expects his mounting: some, however, disallow that قَدْ is used to denote expectation with the pret. because the pret. denotes what is already past; and hence it appears that those who affirm it to be so used mean that the pret. denotes what was expected before the information: (Mughnee: [in which it is added, with some other observations, that, in the opinion of its author, it does not denote expectation even with the aor.; because the saying يَقْدَمُ الغَيِبُ denotes expectation without قَدْ:]) MF says, What we have been orally taught by the sheykhs in ElAndalus is this, that it is a particle denoting the affirmation of truth, or certainty, when it occurs before a pret., and a particle denoting expectation when it occurs before a future. (TA.) ―         -b3-  (2) It denotes the nearness of the past to the present: (O, Mughnee, K:) so in the saying قَدْ قَامَ زَيْدٌ [<i>Zeyd has just,</i> or <i>just now, stood;</i> a meaning often intended by saying merely, <i>has stood</i>]; (Mughnee, K;) for this phrase without قد may mean the near past and the remote past; (Mughnee;) and so in the saying of the muëdhdhin, قَدْ قَامَتِ الصَّلَاةُ [<i>The time of the rising to prayer has just come,</i> or simply <i>has come</i>]: (O:) [and, when thus used, it is often immediately preceded by the pret. or aor. of the verb كَانَ; thus you say, كَانَ قَدْ ذَهَبَ <br>\
                  <i>He had just,</i> or simply <i>had, gone away;</i> and يَكُونُ قَدْ ذَهَبَ <br>\
                  <i>He will,</i> or <i>shall, have just,</i> or simply <i>have gone away:</i>] and accord. to the Basrees, except Akh, it must be either expressed or understood immediately before a pret. used as a denotative of state; as in [the saying in the Kur ii. 247,] وَمَا لَنَا اَلَّا نُقَاتِلُ فِى سَبِيلِ اْللّٰهِ وَقَدْ اُخْرِجْنَا مِنْ دِيَارِنَا <br>\
                  وَاَبْنَايِنَا [<i>And what reason have we that we should not fight in the cause of God when we have been expelled from our abodes and our children?</i>]; and in [the saying in the Kur iv. 92,] اَوْ جَاوُوكُمْ <br>\
                  حَصِرَتْ صُدُورُهُمْ انْ يُقَاتِلُوكَمْ [<i>Or who come to you, their bosoms being contracted so that they</i> <br>\
                  <i>are incapable of fighting you,</i> or <i>their bosoms shrinking from fighting you</i>]; but the Koofees and Akh says that this is not required, because of the frequent occurrence of the pret. as a denotative of state without قَدْ, and [because] the primary rule is that there should be no meaning, or making, anything to be understood, more especially in the case of that which is in frequent use: (Mughnee:) Sb [however] does not allow the use of the pret. as a denotative of state without قَدْ; and he makes حصرت صدورهم to be an imprecation [meaning <i>may their bosoms become contracted</i>]: (S in art. حصر; in which art. in the present work see more on this subject:) and the inceptive لَ is prefixed to it like of the saying, اـِنَّ زَيْدًا لَقَدْ قَامَ [<i>Verily Zeyd has just stood,</i> or <i>has stood</i>]; because the primary rule is that it is to be prefixed to the noun, and it is prefixed to the aor. because it resembles the noun, and when the pret. denotes a time near to the present it resembles the aor. and therefore it is allowable to prefix it thereto. (Mughnee.) [See also the two sentences next after what is mentioned below as the sixth meaning.] ―         -b4-  (3) It denotes rareness, or paucity; (Mughnee, K;) either of the act signified by the verb, (Mughnee,) as in [the saying], قَدْ يَصْدُقُ الكَذُوبُ [<i>In some few instances the habitual liar speaks truth</i>]; (Mughnee, K;) or of what is dependent upon that act, as in [the saying in the Kur xxiv. last verse,] قَدْ يَعْلَمُ مَا <br>\
                  اَنْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ [as though] meaning اَنَّ مَا هُمْ عَلَيْهِ هُوَ <br>\
                  اَقَلُّ مَعْلُومَاتِهِ [so that it should be rendered <i>At least He knoweth that</i> state of conduct and mind <i>to which ye are conforming yourselves</i>]: but some assert that in these exs. and the like thereof it denotes the affirmation of truth, or certainty; [as will be shown hereafter;] and that the denoting of rareness, or paucity, in the former ex. is not inferred from قَدْ, but from the saying الكَذُوبُ <br>\
                  يَصْدُقٌ. (Mughnee.) ―         -b5-  (4) It denotes frequency; (Mughnee, K;) [i. e.] sometimes (S, O) it is used as syn. with رُبَّمَا [as denoting frequency, as well as with رُبَّمَا in the contr. sense, mentioned in the next preceding sentence]: (S, M, O:) thus in the saying (S, M, O, Mughnee, K) of the Hudhalee, (M, Mughnee,) or &#39;Abeed Ibn-El-Abras, (IB, TA,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\
                        قَدْ اَتْرُكُ القِرْنَ مُصْفَرًّا اَنَامِلُهُ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>Often I leave the antagonist having his fingers&#39; ends become yellow</i>]. (S, M, O, Mughnee, K.) ―         -b6-  (5) It denotes the affirmation of truth, or certainty: thus in [the saying in the Kur xci. 9,] قَدْ اَفْلَحَ مَنْ زَكَّاهَا [<i>Verily,</i> or <i>certainly,</i> or <i>indeed,</i> or <i>really, he prospereth,</i> or <i>will prosper, who purifieth it;</i> (namely, his soul;) each pret. here occupying the place of a mejzoom aor.]: (Mughnee, K:) and thus accord. to some in [the saying in the Kur xxiv. last verse, of which another explanation has been given above,] قَدْ <br>\
                  يَعْلَمُ مَا اَنْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ [<i>Verily,</i> or <i>certainly,</i> &amp;amp;c., <i>He knoweth that</i> state of conduct and mind <i>to which ye are conforming yourselves</i>]. (Mughnee.) ―         -b7-  (6) It denotes negation, (Mughnee, K,) accord. to ISd, (Mughnee,) occupying the place of مَا, (M,) in the saying, قَدْ كُنْتَ فِى خَيْرٍ فَتَعْرِفَهُ, (M, Mughnee, K,) with تعرف mansoob, [as though meaning <i>Thou wast not in prosperity, that thou shouldst know it,</i>] (Mughnee, K,) heard from one of the chaste in speech: (M:) but this is strange. (Mughnee.) ―         -b8-  [When it is used to denote the nearness of the past to the present, as appears to be indicated by the context in the O,] قَدْ may be separated from the verb by an oath; as in قَدْ وَاْللّٰهِ اَحْسَنْتَ [<i>Thou hast, by God, done well</i>] and قَدْ لَعَمْرِى بِتُّ سَاهِرًا [<i>I have, by my life,</i> or <i>by my religion, passed the night sleepless</i>]. (O, Mughnee. [In the latter, this and what here next follows are mentioned before the explanations of the meanings of the particle; probably because the meaning in these cases can hardly be mistaken.]) And the verb may be suppressed after it, (M, * O, Mughnee,) when its meaning is apprehended, (O,) or because of an indication; (Mughnee;) as in the saying of En-Nábighah (M, O, Mughnee) Edh-Dhubyánee, (O,) <quote TEIform=&quot;quote&quot;><br>\
                     <L><br>\

                        لَمَّا تَزُلْ بِرِحَالِنَا وَكَاَنْ قَدِ<br>\
                  </quote> [<i>The</i> time of <i>departure has drawn near, though the camels that we ride have not left with our utensils and apparatus for travelling, but it is as though they had</i> (left)]; meaning كَاَنْ قَدْ زَالَتْ. (M, O, Mughnee.) ―         -b9-  If you make قَدْ an اِسْم [i. e. a subst. or a proper name], you characterize it by teshdeed: therefore you say, كَتَبْتُ قَدًّا حَسَنَةً [<i>I wrote a beautiful</i> <br>\
                  قد]; and so you do in the case of كَىْ and هُوَ and لَوْ; because these words have no indication of what is deficient in them [supposing them to be originally of three radical letters], therefore it is requisite to add to the last letter of each what is of the same kind as it, and this is incorporated into it: but not in the case of ا; for in this case you add ء; thus if you name a man لَا, or مَا, and then add at the end of it ا, you make it ء; for you make the second ا movent, and ا when movent becomes ء: (S, O:) so says J, [and Sgh has followed him in the O,] and such is the opinion of Akh and of a number of the grammarians of El-Basrah [and of El-Koofeh (MF)], and F has quoted this passage in the B and left it uncontradicted: but IB says, (TA,) [and after him F in the K,] this is a mistake: that only is characterized by teshdeed of which the last letter is infirm: you say, for هُوَ, (IB, K,) used as the name of a man, (IB,) هُوٌّ, (IB, K,) and for لَوْ you say لَوٌّ, and for فِى you say فِىٌّ; (IB;) and such is characterized by teshdeed only in order that the word may not be reduced to one letter on account of the quiescence of the infirm letter [which would disappear] with tenween [as it does in دَمٌ and يَدٌ &amp;amp;c.]: (K:) but as to قَدْ, if you use it as a name, you say قَدٌ; (IB, K;) and for مَنْ you say مَنٌ, and for عَنْ you say عَنٌ; (K;) like يَدٌ (IB, K) and دَمٌ &amp;amp;c.: (K:) F, however, [following IB,] is wrong in calling J&#39;s statement a mistake; though the rule given by him [and IB] is generally preferred.
