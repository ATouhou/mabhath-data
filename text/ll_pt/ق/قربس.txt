                  , and قَرْبُوسٌ, but the latter is only used in poetry, (S,) by poetic license, (K,) because فَعْلُولٌ is not one of the measures of Arabic words, (S,) or, accord. to AZ, is a dial. form, and, as such, is said by MF, to be written قُرْبُوس, with damm to the ق and with the ر quiescent, but this is a mistake; (TA;) [<i>A thing</i>] <i>pertaining to the saddle of a horse;</i> (S;) <i>each of the two curved pieces of wood of the saddle of a horse,</i> (IDrd, K,) <i>which form its fore part and its hinder part;</i> [<i>one answering to the pommel of our saddle, and the other being the troussequin;</i>] <i>together corresponding to the</i> <br>\
