طَوٌّ: see طَوًى.
طَىٌّ [originally an inf. n., of طَوَى, q. v.,] and
↓ طِىٌّ and ↓ طِوَى, [said in one place in the TA
to be like إِلَى, but I think that this is only said
to show that its first vowel is kesr and the second
fet-h, and that it is correctly طِوًى, for there is no
reason for its being imperfectly decl.,] accord. to
the M, are sings. of أَطْوَآءٌ, which it explains as
signifying The lines, or streaks, and creases, of
the folding of a garment, or piece of cloth, and of
a written piece of paper, and of the belly, and of fat,
and of the guts, and of a serpent, and of other
things; and it is said in the T and K that ↓ مَطَاوٍ, of
which the sing. is ↓ مَطْوًى, signifies the أَطْوَآء of
the serpent, and of the guts, and of fat, and of
the belly, and of a garment, or piece of cloth:
(TA:) one says, أَمَعَائِهَا ↓ مَا بَقِيَتْ فِى مَطَاوِى
ثَمِيلَةٌ [There remained not in the creases of her,
or their, guts any relic of food]: (A, TA:) and
الدِّرْعِ ↓ مَطَاوِى signifies the creases of the coat of
mail when it is drawn together, or contracted.
(TA.) [Hence,] one says, عَلَى جَبِينِهَا أَطْوَآءُ النَّجْمِ
i. e. طَرَائِقُهُ [app. meaning Upon her forehead (for
so جَبِين sometimes signifies) are the wrinkles
indicative of the time for the payment of the debt
of nature]. (TA.) The أَطْوَآء in the she-camel
are The طَرَائِق [i. e. lines, or streaks, or perhaps
creases, or wrinkles,] of the fat (S, K, TA) of
the hump: (K, TA:) [or the creases, or wrinkles,
one above another, of the side and of the hump;
for] Lth says, طَرَائِقُ جَنْبِهَا وَسَنَامهَا طَىٌّ فَوْقَ طَىٍّ
[the creases, or wrinkles, of her side and of her
hump are, or consist of, طَىّ above طَىّ]. (TA.)
And AHn says that أَطْوَآءٌ signifies The bending
[or rather he should have said, or perhaps he did
say, the places of bending] in the tail of the locust,
[which are] like عُقَد [or articulations]: and the pl.
[of mult.] is ↓ طِوَى [said to be like إِلَى, but I think
that it is correctly طِوًى, as I have observed
above]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  One says also, وَجَدْتُ فِى طَىِّ
الكِتَابِ كَذَا [lit. I found within the folding of the
writing, or letter, such a thing; meaning, infolded,
or enclosed, or included, in it; or among the
contents, or implications, of it]: and فِى أَطْوَآءِ
الكُتُبِ and ↓ مَطَاوِيهَا [lit. within the folds, or
places of folding, of the writings, or letters]. (A,
TA.) And الغِلُّ فِى طَىِّ قَلْبِهِ (tropical:)  [Rancour,
malevolence, malice, or spite, is conceived, as
though it were infolded, in his heart]. (TA.
[See 7.]) And أَدْرَجَنِى فِى طَىِّ النِّسْيَانِ (tropical:)  [He, or

sentence.
طَيَّةٌ [inf. n. of un. of طَوَى]. You say, طَوَاهُ
طَيَّةً وَاحِدَةً [He folded it, &c., with one folding
&c.]. (TA.)
طِيَّةٌ, (S, TA,) from طَوَيْتُ الشَّىْءَ, (S,) is like
جِلْسَةٌ (S, TA) and رِكْبَةٌ (S) and مِشْيَةٌ, signifying A mode, or manner, of folding &c.; and a
mode, or manner, of being folded &c. (TA.)
One says, إِنَّهُ لَحَسَنُ الطِّيَّةِ [Verily he is good in
respect of the mode, or manner, of folding, &c.].
(K, TA.) And طَوَاهُ طِيَّةً جَيِّدَةً [He folded it,
&c., in a good mode, or manner, of doing
so]. (TA.) And hence the saying of Dhu-rRummeh,
كَمَا تُنَشَّرُ بَعْدَ الطِّيَّةِ الكُتُبُ
[Like as the writings, or letters, are unfolded
after the folding in a particular manner]: (S,
TA:) he said طِيَّة, with kesr, because he did not
mean a single time [of folding]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [See
also 1, second sentence, where it is mentioned as
a simple inf. n., and sometimes pronounced
طِيَةٌ, without teshdeed.] ―
-b3-  Also i. q. نِيَّةٌ; (S,
K;) and so ↓ طَوِيَّةٌ; (K;) and [agreeably with
this explanation] Kh says that it may mean A
place of alighting or abode [to which one purposes
repairing, or betaking himself], and it may mean
an object of aim or purpose or intention [whatever
it be]: (S:) and in the A it is expl. as meaning
the direction towards which countries are traversed: (TA:) one says طِيَّةٌ بَعِيدَةٌ i. e. [A place
of alighting or abode &c.] that is distant, or
remote: and بَعُدَتْ عَنَّا طِيَّتُهُ i. e. The place of alighting, or of abode, to which he purposed repairing [was
distant, or remote]: and مَضَى لِطِيَّتِهِ i. e. [He
went] to his نِيَّة [meaning either place of alighting
&c. or object of aim &c.] that he purposed: (S:)
and لَقِيتُهُ بِطِيَّاتِ العِرَاقِ i. e. [I met him in] the
regions, or quarters, or directions, of El-'Irak:
and sometimes it is pronounced طِيَةٌ, without
teshdeed. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Also An object of want or
need. (TA.) [Therefore مَضَى لِطِيَّتِهِ may be
rendered He went to accomplish his object of want
or need.] ―
-b5-  آخِرَ طِيَّةٍ is syn. with آخِرَ مَخْطَرٍ [expl.
voce خَطْرَةٌ, q. v.]. (TA in art. خطر.)
طَوًى A skin for water or milk; syn. سِقَآءٌ;
(K;) as also ↓ طَىٌّ: or the former signifies a
skin (سقآء) that has been folded having in it its
moisture, and has consequently become dissundered;
app. an inf. n. [of طَوِىَ] used as a subst. [properly
so called]: and ↓ سِقَآءٌ طَوٍ signifies [the same, or]
a skin that has been folded having in it moisture,
or some remains of milk, in consequence of which
it has become altered, and stinking, and dissundered
by putrefaction. (TA.)
-A2-  Also Hunger; (S;)
[and] so ↓ طَوٌّ [if not a mistranscription]. (TA.
[See طَوِىَ, of which the former is an inf. n., as
also طِوًى.])
طُوًى is said by some to be like ↓ طِوًى, meaning A thing twice done [as though folded]; and
to be thus in the Kur [xx. 12 and lxxix. 16];
meaning twice sanctified [referring to the valley
there mentioned]; (S, TA; [and thus expl., and
said to be like ثِنًى, in the Ksh and by Bd;]) or,
as El-Hasan says, twice blest and sanctified: (S,
TA:) or meaning twice called [referring to the
calling of Moses mentioned in the context]. (Ksh
and Bd in xx. 12, and in like manner says Er-Rághib.) [But طُوَى (as most pronounce it) or
طُوًى, in the Kur, is generally held to be the name
of a certain valley. Golius explains طُوًى and
طِوًى as meaning “ Plicata, plicabilis, res; ”
which is a mistake: and he adds, “Ambulatio,
incessus reciprocatus, ultro citroque in se rediens: ” for the latter of these explanations, both of
which he gives as on the authority of J and the
K, I am quite unable to account.]

Msb, * TA) with stones, or with baked bricks; as
also ↓ طَىٌّ: (TA:) of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the
sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: (Msb:) it is masc.,
but may be made fem. to accord. with the meaning [i. e. بِئْرٌ]: (M, TA:) pl. أَطْوَآءٌ: accord. to the
K, ↓ طَوِيَّةٌ signifies a well; but [SM says] I have
not seen that any one has mentioned this. (TA.)

night: (K:) one says, أَتَيْتُهُ بَعْدَ طَوِىٍّ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ
