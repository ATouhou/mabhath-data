طهر1
طَهَرَ and
طَهُرَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor. of each
طَهُرَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. طَهَارَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) which
is of each verb, (S, Msb,) and طُهْرٌ, (Sb, K,) or
the latter is a simple subst., (S, Msb,) It was, or
became, clean, free from dirt or filth, or pure.
(A, * Msb, K. *) طهارة is of two kinds; [properly]
corporeal and [tropically] spiritual. (TA.) ―
-b2-
And طَهَرَتْ, (M, Mgh, K,) or طَهَرَتْ مِنَ الحَيْضِ,
aor.
طَهُرَ; (Msb;) and طَهُرَتْ, (M, Msb, K,) which
is allowable, (IAar,) but of rare occurrence,
(Msb,) and طَهِرَتْ, [which is of more rare occurrence;] (M, El-Isnawee;) inf. n. طُهْرٌ and طَهَارَةٌ
and طُهُورٌ and طَهُورٌ; (TA;) She was, or became,
pure from the menstrual discharge; (Mgh;) her
discharge of blood stopped. (Mgh, K.) See also
5. The saying, إِنَّ الشَّاةَ تَقْذِى عَشْرًا ثُمَّ تَطْهُرُ
[Verily the ewe, or she-goat, emits a white fluid
from her womb during ten nights, and then becomes pure,] is mentioned on the authority of
Lh: but ISd says, whether he mentioned this as
heard from the Arabs, or did so presumptuously,
I know not. (TA.)
-A2-  طَهَرَهُ, aor.
طَهَرَ, (K,) inf. n.
طَهْرٌ,) (TK,) signifies He made it, or caused it,
to be, or become, distant, or remote; syn. أَبْعَدَهُ:
(O, K:) and so طَحَرَهُ; (O, TA;) the ح being
substituted for ه. (TA.)
2
طهّرهُ, inf. n. تَطْهِيرٌ, [He cleansed, or purified,
him, or it:] (S:) and طهّرهُ بِالمَآءِ he washed him,
or it, with water: (K:) and ↓ أَطْهَرَهُ signifies
the same as طهّرهُ. (Bd in lvi. 78.) ―
-b2-  طَهِّرَا بَيْتِى,
in the Kur [ii. 119], Cleanse ye my house [the
Kaabeh] of the idols (Aboo-Is-hák, Bd, Jel) and
impurities; and what does not become it: (Bd:)
or clear ye it: (Bd:) or cleanse ye my house
from [pollution by] disobediences and forbidden
actions: (Az:) or, accord. to some, it means an
incitement to purify the heart. (TA.) ―
-b3-  وَثِيَابَكَ
فَطَهِّرْ, in the Kur [lxxiv. 4], means And cleanse
thy clothes from dirt: (Jel:) or shorten thy
clothes, to prevent their being rendered dirty by
trailing along the ground: (Jel, TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  purify
thy heart: or (assumed tropical:)  thy soul: or (assumed tropical:)  make thy conduct
right: (TA:) and see other explanations voce
ثَوْبٌ. ―
-b4-  طهّر وَلَدَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He performed the rite of
circumcision upon his son [and so purified him].

أَطْهَرَ see 2, first sentence.
5
تطهّر, inf. n. تَطَهُّرٌ, is sometimes changed into
اِطَّهَّرَ, inf. n. اِطَّهُّرٌ, the ت being incorporated into
the ط, and this requiring a conjunctive ا, (Sgh,
K,) in order that the word may not begin with a
quiescent letter: (Sgh:) and طَهُورٌ is also an
inf. n. [or rather a quasi-inf. n.] (Sb, K) of
تَطَهَّرَ, (Mgh, TA,) like as وَضُوْءٌ is [said to be] of
تَوَضَّأَ. (TA.) The meaning is, [He became
cleansed, or purified: or he cleansed, or purified,
himself: and] he washed himself. (Mgh.) You
say, تطهّر بِالمَآءِ [He cleansed, or purified, or
washed, himself with water]: (S:) he performed
the ablution termed الوُضُوْء: and that termed
الاِسْتِنْجَآء; (A;) as also تطهّر alone, as used in
the Kur ix. 109: (Mgh, TA:) and the same
verb, alone, is expl. as signifying he made use of
water, or what supplied its place; thus used in
the Kur v. 9. (TA.) In the Kur vii. 80 and
xxvii. 57, the verb is used derisively. (TA.)
You say also, تطهّرت, (Mgh, Msb, K,) and
اِطَّهَّرَتْ, (Mgh,) meaning, She cleansed, or
purified, herself by washing, from [the pollution
of] the menstrual discharge, (Mgh, Msb, K,)
&c.; (K;) as also ↓ طَهَرَتْ and طَهُرَتْ; (Msb, *
K;) agreeably with what is said in the B, that
طَهَرَ and طَهُرَ and اطّهّر and تطهّر have the same
signification: (TA:) or تطهّرت and اطّهّرت have
this signification; but the unaugmented verb has
the signification first assigned to it, or “ her discharge of blood stopped: ” (Abu-l-'Abbás, IAar:)
in the Kur ii. 222, some read حَتَّى يَطْهُرْنَ; and
others, حَتَّى يَطَّهَّرْنَ: but the latter reading is the
preferable, on account of the difference between
the two forms of the verb, just mentioned:
(Abu-l-'Abbás:) or the law which allows not
the touching a woman until she has performed
the ablution mentioned above shows the two
forms of the verb to be the same in signification.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  He removed himself far from
unclean things, or impurities. (S, Mgh, K. *) ―
-b3-
(tropical:)  He refrained from sin, (K, TA,) and from
what was not good: (TA:) he removed himself
far from low, or ignoble, habits: and in this
sense, accord. to some, it is used in the Kur vii.
80 and xxvii. 57. (TA.) And تطهّر مِنَ الإِثْمِ
(tropical:)  He removed himself far from sin. (A.)
طُهْرٌ [see 1: ―
-b2- ] Cleanness; freedom from dirt
or filth; or pureness. (S, * Msb.) ―
-b3-  The state of
pureness from the menstrual discharge: (S, A,
Mgh, Msb:) pl. أَطْهَارٌ. (A, Msb.) And the pl.
signifies The days of a woman's state of pureness
from the menstrual discharge. (K.)
طَهِرٌ: see طَاهِرٌ, in three places.
طُهْرَةٌ a subst. from التَّطْهِيرُ [and signifying A
cleansing, or purification: and in this sense it
was applied by the Christians to baptism]:
(Mgh:) or from طَهَّرَهُ بِالمَآءِ [and signifying a
cleansing, or purification, by water]: (K:) or
cleanness, or pureness. (TK.)
طَهُورٌ inf. n. of 1; as also طُهُورٌ: (TA:) and
inf. n. [or rather quasi-inf. n.] of 5. (Sb, Mgh,
TA.) ―
-b2-  A thing [such as water] with which one
cleanses or purifies: (T, S, Mgh, Msb, K:) a
word similar to فَطُورٌ and سَحُورٌ and وَقُودٌ: (S:)
and the author of the “ Matáli' el-Anwár ” mentions طُهُورٌ also in this sense; but this is strange
and anomalous: (En-Nawawee:) the former occurs
in the Kur xxv. 50: (S:) or it signifies water
with which the ablution termed وُضُوْء is performed: (A, IAth:) or it has the signification
next following. (K.) It is said, التَّوْبَةُ طَهُورٌ
لِلْمُذْنِبِ (tropical:)  [Repentance is a means of purifying the
sinner, or criminal]. (A.) Lth says that it is
that which is [accompanied] by the execution of
the prescribed punishment, such as stoning &c.
(TA.) [See also مَطْهَرَةٌ.]
-A2-  It is also an epithet,
(Mgh, TA,) and signifies Clean and cleansing,
or pure and purifying: (Th, T, Mgh, Msb:)
whatever God has created descending from the
sky, or welling forth from the earth as a spring
or river or sea, in which a human being does
nothing but drawing water, and of which the
colour is not changed by anything mixing with
it, nor the taste thereby, is طَهُور: and what is
otherwise, as the water of roses and of the leaves
of trees, and what flows from the grape-vine,
though it be طَاهِر, is not طَهُور: (Esh-Sháfi'ee:)
the former removes impurities: the latter, if not
at the same time طَهُور, does not: (TA:) or very
clean or pure: (A, Msb:) the explanation by
Th, if meant to show that the word signifies of the
utmost cleanness or pureness, is correct and good:
otherwise, it is not so; for فَعُولٌ is not formed
from تَفْعِيلٌ: (Mgh, O:) it is also explained as
signifying, simply, cleansing, or purifying: (B,
TA:) also as syn. with طَاهِرٌ, as in the phrase
رِيقُهُنَّ طَهُورٌ [their saliva is pure]: but here it is
either an intensive epithet or used for طَاهِرٌ for
the sake of the measure. (Msb.)
طَهِيرٌ: see طَاهِرٌ, in two places.
طَهَارَةٌ [see 1. ―
-b2- ] The act of performing the
ablution termed الغُسْل, and that termed الوُضُوْء,
and that termed الاِسْتِنْجَآء. (Msb, TA.)
طُهَارَةٌ What remains of that with which one
has performed the ablution termed طَهَارَة. (TA.)
طَهُورِيَّةٌ The quality of being طَهُور. (Msb.)
طَاهِرٌ Clean; free from dirt or filth; or pure;
(Msb, K;) as also ↓ طَهِرٌ (IAar, K) and ↓ طَهِيرٌ:
(M, K:) fem. طَاهِرَةٌ: (S, A, Msb:) pl. (of
طَاهِرٌ, TA) أَطْهَارٌ (K) and طَهَارَى, (S, K,) which
latter is anomalous, as though its sing. were
طَهْرَانُ, (S,) and, applied to men, طَاهِرُونَ: (TA:)
and (of ↓ طَهِرٌ, TA) طَهِرُونَ; (K;) the only
form; there being no broken pl.: (TA:) and of
طَاهِرَةٌ, طَاهِرَاتٌ (TA) and طَوَاهِرُ. (A.) You say,
رَجُلٌ طَاهِرٌ and ↓ طَهِيرٌ [A clean, or pure, man].
(O.) And اِمْرَأَةٌ طَاهِرَةٌ مِنَ النَّجَاسَةِ [A woman
pure from dirt or filth]. (S.) And مَآءٌ طَاهِرٌ
Clean, or pure, water: and also, fit to cleanse
or purify with. (Msb.) And ثِيَابٌ طَهَارَى [Clean
clothes]. (S.) [See also طَهُورٌ.] ―
-b2-  Pure from
the menstrual discharge; in this sense without ة:
(IAar:) as also طَاهِرٌ مِنَ الحَيْضِ. (S, Msb.)
―
-b3-  هُوَ طَاهِرُ العِرْضِ (assumed tropical:)  He is clear from vice, or
fault. (Msb.) اِمْرَأَةٌ طَاهِرَةٌ مِنَ العُيُوبِ (assumed tropical:)  [A
woman pure from vices, or the like]. (S.) And
رَجُلٌ طَاهِرُ الثِّيَابِ, (S, A, TA,) and طَاهِرُ الأَثْوَابِ,
(TA,) (tropical:)  A man free, or far-removed, from low,
or ignoble, habits: (S, * A, TA:) and in like
manner, طَاهِرُ الخُلُقِ, and الخُلُقِ ↓ طَهِرُ: fem. طَاهِرَة.
(TA.)
أَطْهَرُ [More, and most, clean or pure]. ―
-b2-
[Hence,] هُنَّ أَطْهَرُ لَكُمْ [Kur xi. 80] (assumed tropical:)  They are
more lawful to you. (O, TA.)
مَطْهَرَةٌ and مِطْهَرَةٌ, (S, A, K, &c.,) the former of
which is the more approved, (S,) A vessel, (A,
K,) or any vessel, (Mgh, Msb,) [for purification,
i. e.,] with which one washes himself, (A, Mgh,
Msb, K,) and performs the ablution termed وُضُوْء,
such as a سَطْل, or رَكْوَة: (TA:) and (A, Mgh,
Msb, K) i. q. إِدَاوَةٌ [a kind of leathern vessel for
water]: (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K:) pl. مَطَاهِرُ. (S,
Msb.) Hence, [or from مَطْهَرَةٌ as signifying,
agreeably with analogy, A means of cleansing or
purifying,] the saying, (Msb,) السِّوَاكُ مَطْهَرَةٌ لِلْفَمِ
[The tooth-stick is a means of purifying to
the mouth]. (S, Msb.) ―
-b2-  Also A house, or
chamber, in which one washes himself, (K,
TA,) and performs the ablutions termed وُضُوْء
and غُسْل and اِسْتِنْجَآء. (TA.)
صُحُفًا مُطَهَّرَةً, in the Kur [xcviii. 2], signifies
Writings cleansed from impurities and falsehood.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And أَزْوَاجٌ مُطَهَّرَةٌ, in the same [ii. 23],
Wives purified from the pollution of the menstrual
discharge and the other natural evacuations. (O,
TA.) ―
-b3-  And لَا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا المُطَهَّرُونَ, in the same
[lvi. 78], is said by some to mean, (assumed tropical:)  None shall
attain to the knowledge of its true meanings except
those who have purified themselves from the filth
of corrupt conduct, and ignorances, and acts of
disobedience. (TA.)
وَمُطَهِّرُكَ مِنَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا, in the Kur [iii. 48],
signifies And will take thee forth from those who
have disbelieved, and make thee to be far from
doing as they do. (TA.)
وَيُحِبُّ المُتَطَهِّرِينَ, in the Kur [ii. 222], signifies And He loveth those who purify their spirits.
(TA.)
طهو and طهى
1
طَهَا, aor. يَطْهُو and يَطْهَى, inf. n. طَهْوٌ (S, K)
and طُهُوٌّ (K) and طَهْىٌ, (S, [so in both of my
copies,]) or طُهِىٌّ, (K,) and طَهَايَةٌ, thus app.
accord. to the K, [and thus in my MS. copy and
in the CK,) but in the M with kesr [i. e. طِهَايَةٌ],
(TA,) He cooked flesh-meat in the manner termed
طَبْخ [meaning by boiling or stewing or the like],
(S, K,) or by roasting or broiling or frying:
(K:) and [he made, or kneaded and baked,
bread; for] الطَّهْوُ signifies also الخَبْرُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-
[And hence, (assumed tropical:)  He performed, or executed, an
affair firmly, soundly, or thoroughly; and matured
it: see the pass. part. n., below; and see also
طَهْوٌ.]
-A2-  And طَهَا, (S, K,) inf. n. طَهْوٌ, (TA,)
said of a man, (S,) He went away into the
country, or in the land: (S, K:) like طَحَا: (S:)
[or] you say, طَهَا فِى الأَرْضِ, inf. n. طَهْوٌ; and
طَهَى فِى الأَرْضِ, inf. n. طَهْىٌ: both signify the
same. (TA.) And in like manner, طَهَتِ الإِبِلُ,
(S, TA,) aor. تَطْهَى, inf. n. طَهْوٌ and طُهُوٌّ, (TA,)

crime, fault, or misdemeanour. (TA. [See also

4
اطهى He was, or became, skilled in his

طَهَا is used by Abu-n-Nejm for طٰهٰ meaning
the Chapter of the Kur-án [thus called, because
commencing with these two letters, namely, the
20th,] in his saying,
مَدَّ لَنَا فِى عُمْرِهِ رَبُّ طَهَا
[May the Lord of طٰهٰ lengthen for us his life].
(TA.) [See art. طه.]
طَهْوٌ [The cooking of flesh-meat: see 1, first
sentence. ―
-b2-  And hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A deed, or a performance. (S, K, TA.) Thus in a trad., (S,
TA,) in which it is related that it was said to
Aboo-Hureyreh, “Didst thou hear this from the
Apostle of God? ” and he replied وَمَا كَانَ طَهْوِى
i. e. (assumed tropical:)  And what was my deed, or performance?
or, accord. to A 'Obeyd, أَنَا مَا طَهْوِى [I, what is
my deed, or performance?] (TA) or فَمَا طَهْوِى

their sounds, or voices:] and one says, فلان فى
طهى ونهى [app. فى طَهْىٍ وَنَهْىِ, as though meaning Such a one is engaged in clamour and prohibition]. (TA.)
طَهًى Broken bits of straw. (K, TA.)
طُهًى Cooked flesh-meat. (IAar, K.) [It is
said in one place in the TA that الطُهى, with
damm, (as though it were الطُّهْىُ, but I suppose
الطُّهَى to be meant,) is the subst. from طَهَا اللَّحْمَ.]
-A2-  Also A sin, crime, fault, misdemeanour, or
misdeed; syn. ذَنْبٌ; (K, TA; [in some copies
of the K, الذَّنَبُ is put (erroneously, as is said
in the TA,) in the place of الذَّنْبُ; and in the
CK, الذِّئْبُ;]) as also ↓ طَهْىٌ: and ↓ مَا طَهْوِى
in the trad. of Aboo-Hureyreh [mentioned above]
is expl. by some as meaning مَا ذَنْبِى [What is
my fault?]. (TA.)
طَهَآءٌ, (S, K, TA,) with the lengthened ا, (S,
TA,) is like طَخَآءٌ; (K, TA; [in some copies of
the K, each of these is erroneously written with
the shortened ا, without ء;]) i. e. it is a dial. var.
of the latter word, signifying High, or elevated,
clouds: (S, TA:) or thin clouds: (Ham p. 12:
[see also طَهْىٌ:]) [and طَهَآءَةٌ is the n. un.:] one
says, مَا فِى السَّمَآءِ طَهَآءَةٌ, meaning There is not in
the sky a portion of cloud. (S.)
طُهَاوَةٌ The thin skin that is upon milk or blood.

-b2-  And
A بَرَّادَة [meaning a stand, or shelf, upon which
vessels of porous earth, containing water, are
placed, in order that the water may become cool].

it is with teshdeed; and it is written in my MS.
copy of the K بَرَّادَة.]) ―
-b3-  In the saying of ElAhwal El-Kindee,
فَلَيْتَ لَنَا مِنْ مَآءِ زَمْزَمَ شَرْبَةً
مُبَرَّدَةً بَاتَتْ عَلَى الطَّهَيَانِ
[And would that there were for us, of the water
of Zemzem, a cooled draught that had passed the
night upon the طَهَيَان], it has been expl. as having
the former of these meaning, and as having the
second thereof, and as meaning a certain mountain
in El-Yemen. (TA.)

bread: (K:) and, (K, TA,) as some say, (TA,)
any dresser, or preparer, of food, (K, TA,) &c.,
who qualifies it well, rightly, or properly: (TA:)
pl. طُهَاةٌ and طُهِىٌّ: (K, TA: [in the CK the
latter is written طُهًى, which is evidently wrong;
whereas طُهِىٌّ is agreeable with analogy, being
originally طُهُوْىٌ:]) the fem. is طَاهِيَةٌ, and its pl.
is طَوَاهٍ. (TA.)
-A2-  لَيْلٌ طَاهٍ A dark night. (TA.)
أَمْرٌ مَطْهُوٌّ (tropical:)  An affair performed, or executed,
