طرثR. Q. 2
تَطَرْثَثَ He gathered, or collected, the
species of plants called طُرْثُوث. (S, Msb, K.)
طَرْثٌ Any plant (نَبَات, K [so in the TA and
in my MS. copy of the K, in the CK بِناء, which
is an evident mistranscription,]) that is fresh and
juicy. (K.)
طِرْثٌ The extremity of the بَظْر [q. v.]. (K.)
―
-b2-  And Flaccidity, or flabbiness. (L.)
طُرْثُوثٌ A species of plant, which is eaten; (S,
K;) [app. a kind, or species, of fungus; perhaps
a species of phallus;] a plant of the same kind as
the ذُؤْنُون and the عُرْجُون; (IAar, T in art. ذأن;)
accord. to Lth, a slender, oblong plant, inclining
to redness, and serving as a دِبَاغ to the stomach
[app. meaning a stomachic], included among
medicines, of which there is a bitter sort and
a sweet sort; (Msb;) in the M said to be a
plant of the sands, long and slender, similar to
the فُطْر [q. v.], inclining to redness, which dries,
and serves as a دِبَاغ to the stomach; n. un. with
ة; on the authority of AHn: it is of two sorts;
one sweet, which is the red; and one bitter, which
is the white; IAar says that it is a plant of the
length of a cubit, having no leaves, as though it
were of the same kind as the truffle; (TA;) Az
says that the طرثوث of the desert has no leaves
(Msb, TA) nor any fruit, (TA,) grows in the
sands (Msb, TA) and in the level grounds, (TA,)
has in it no acidity, (Msb,) but a sweetness inclining to astringency and bitterness, and is red,
with a round head, (Msb, TA,) like the glans of
a man's penis: (TA:) [Ibn-Seenà (whom we call
Avicenna), in his list of medicinal simples, (book
ii., p. 183 of the printed ed.,) describes طَرَاثِيث
as pieces of wood in a rotting state, of the thickness
of a finger, and in length less and more, having an
astringent taste, and dust-coloured; said to be
brought from the desert. See also سُوقَةٌ.] The
Arabs say, طَرَاثِيثُ لَا أَرْطَى لَهَا [Turthoothehs
without artáhs]: because the former grow not
save with the latter: a prov., like ذَآنِينُ لَا رِمْثَ
لَهَا: applied to him who is ruined, and has
nothing remaining, after having had ancestry
and rank and wealth. (TA. [See also art. ذأن,
last sentence.]) ―
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  The glans of a man's
penis: (K, TA:) so called as being likened to
[the head of] the plant above described. (TA.)
