طهR. Q. 1
طَهْطَهَ He laughed immoderately: (L
voce كَدْكَدَ:) or you say طَهْطَهَ فِى ضَحِكِهِ,
meaning he laughed slightly; like طَحْطَحَ. (O
and TA in art. طح.)
طَهْ [at the commencement of the 20th chapter
of the Kur-án] means اِطْمَئِنّ [Be thou still,
&c.]: (K, TA:) and thus it is expl. as occurring
in a trad. respecting Moses' hearing the speech of
the Lord of Might: (TA:) or, as some say, it is
for طَأْ [imperative of وَطِئَ], meaning tread upon
the ground with the soles of both thy feet; because
the Prophet raised one of his feet in prayer:
(TA in art. وطأ:) or it means O man, in the
Abyssinian language; (Lth, K, TA;) or so in
Syriac, accord. to Katádeh; or so in Nabathæan,
accord. to other authorities: (TA:) read طٰهٰ,
with the two fet-hahs pronounced fully, it is two
letters of the alphabet (مِنَ الهِجَآءِ [strangely misunderstood by Freytag as meaning “ quibus
maledicitur ”]): (Lth, K, TA:) Ibn-Mes'ood is
related to have read طِهِ, with the two kesrehs
pronounced fully: and Fr says that some divided
it, reading طِ هِ: (TA:) Abu-n-Nejm has called
it طَهَا. (TA in art. طهو, q. v.)
طَهْطَهَةٌ sing. of طَهَاطِهُ, (TA,) which signifies
The voices [or neighings] of horses. (K, TA.)
طَهْطَاهٌ, as an epithet applied to a horse, That
excites admiration by his beauty, or swift and
excellent; youthful; excelling in beauty. (Lth, L,
K, TA.)
