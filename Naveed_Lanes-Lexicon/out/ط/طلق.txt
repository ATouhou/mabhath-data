(tropical:)  [It is thine lawfully &c.]. (S, O, K, TA.)
And اِفْعَلْ هٰذَا طِلْقًا لَكَ (assumed tropical:)  Do thou this as a thing
lawful &c. to thee. (Msb.) And أَعْطَيْتُهُ مِنْ
طِلْقِ مَالِى (assumed tropical:)  I gave him of what was lawful &c.,
i. e. free to be disposed of by me, of my property:
(Msb:) or (tropical:)  of what was clear [from any claim
or the like], and good, or lawful, of my property.
(TA.) And الخَيْلُ طِلْقٌ, occurring in a trad. as
meaning (tropical:)  Horses are allowable to be betted upon.
(TA.) And أَنْتَ طِلْقٌ مِنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ (tropical:)  Thou art
clear of this affair; (S, O, K, * TA; *) quit of it,
or irresponsible for it. (K, TA.) ―
-b4-  [In consequence of a misplacement in some copies of the
K, several meanings belonging to طَلَقٌ are assigned to طِلْقٌ.]
-A2-  See also طَلَقٌ, latter half.
طَلَقٌ: see طَلْقٌ, second sentence. ―
-b2-  Also the
subst. from طَلَقَتِ الإِبِلُ: (AZ, S, TA: [see 1,
second sentence:]) and [as such] signifying The
journeying [of camels] during the night to arrive
at the water in the next night, there being two
nights between them and the water; the first of
which nights is termed الطَّلَقُ [or لَيْلَةُ الطَّلَقِ (see
حَوْزٌ)]; the pastor loosing them to repair to the
water, [in the CK يَجْلِبُها is put for يُخَلِّيهَا,] and
leaving them to pasture while going thither: the
camels after the driving, during the first night, are
said to be ↓ طَوَالِقُ; and in the second night,
قَوَارِبُ: (S, O, K, TA:) or الطَّلَقُ signifies the
first of two days intervening between the camels
and the water; and القَرَبُ, the second: and لَيْلَةُ
الطَّلَقِ, the night in which the faces of the camels
are turned towards the water and during which
they are left to pasture; and لَيْلَةُ القَرَبِ, the
second night: (As, TA:) but it has been said
that لَيْلَةُ الطَّلَقِ means the second of the nights in
which the camels repair to the water: Th says
that الطَّلَقُ signifies the second of two days during
which the camels seek the water when it is two
days distant from them; and القَرَبُ, the first of
those days: and it is said that لَيْلَةُ الطَّلَقِ means
[the night of] the turning of the faces of the
camels towards the water: but this explanation
was not pleasing to ISd. (TA.) [See an ex.
voce حَوْزٌ, in which it is used tropically.] ―
-b3-  Also
A heat; i. e. a single run, or run at once, to a
goal, or limit; syn. شَوْطٌ; (S, IAth, O, Msb,
K, TA;) meaning a running, of a horse, without
restraining himself, [or without stopping,] to a
goal, or limit: (Msb:) and the utmost extent to
which a horse runs. (TA.) One says of a horse,
عَدَا طَلَقًا or طَلَقَيْنِ [He ran a heat or two heats].
(S, O, Msb, K. [In the CK, erroneously, طَلْقًا
and طَلْقَيْنِ.]) ―
-b4-  And (hence, TA) (tropical:)  A share, or
portion, (Ibn-'Abbád, A, O, K, TA,) of property
[&c.]. (A, TA.)
-A2-  Also A shackle, or pair of
shackles, (قَيْدٌ,) of skins: (S, M, O, K, TA:) or
a rope strongly twisted, so that it will stand up.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And sing. of أَطْلَاقٌ which signifies The
[intestines into which the food passes from the
stomach, termed the] أَمْعَآء, or the أَقْتَاب of the
belly; (IDrd, O, K; * [in some copies of the last
of which, القُنْبُ is erroneously put for القِتْبُ as
one of the words explaining الطَّلَقُ;]) so in one or
more of the dialects: AO says, in the belly are
أَطْلَاق, of which the sing. is طَلَقٌ; (O, TA;)
meaning the lines, or streaks, (طَرَائِق,) of the
belly: and طَلَقُ البَطْنِ is also expl. [in like
manner] as meaning the جُدَّة of the belly; pl. as
above. (TA.)
-A3-  Also The [plant called] شُبْرُم:
[but what plant is meant by this is doubtful:] or
a plant that is used in dyes: or this is a mistake:
(K:) [or] accord. to Ibn-'Abbád, ↓ الطَّلْقُ is
what is used in dyes; and is said to be the شُبْرُم:
(O, TA: *) and (K) accord. to As, (O,) طَلَقٌ
signifies a sort of medicament, (O, K,) which,
when one is anointed therewith, (K,) i. e. with the
extract thereof, (TA,) prevents the burning of
fire: (K:) or a species of plant: so says As:
(O:) the appellation by which it is generally
known is ↓ طَلْق, with the ل quiescent; (O, K;)
or this pronunciation is incorrect: (K:) and
AHát mentions, (K, TA,) on the authority of
As, (TA,) its being termed ↓ طِلْقٌ: (K, TA:)
but it is not a plant: it is of the nature of stones,
and of [what are termed] لِخَاف [thin white
stones]; and probably he [referring to As] heard
that it is called كَوْكَبُ الأَرْضِ, and therefore
supposed it to be a plant; for if it were a plant,
fire would burn it; but fire does not burn it,
unless by means of artful contrivances: (O, TA:)
the word is arabicized, from تَلَكْ: (K, TA: in
the O written تِلك:) [it is the well-known mineral
termed talc:] the Ra-ees [Ibn-Seenà, whom we
call “ Avicenna,”] says, (TA,) it is a brightlyshining stone, that separates, when it is bruised,
into several laminæ and split pieces, of which are
made مَضَاوِى [correctly مَضَاوِئ, meaning small
circular panes which are inserted in apertures to
admit light,] for the [cupolas of] hot baths,
instead of glass: the best is that of El-Yemen;
then that of India; then that of El-Undulus [or
El-Andalus]: the art employed in dissolving it
consists in putting it into a piece of rag with some
pebbles and immersing it in tepid water, then
moving it about gently until it becomes dissolved
and comes forth from the piece of rag into the
water, whereupon the water is strained from it,
and it is put in the sun to dry. (K, TA.)
طَلِقٌ ذَلِقٌ: ―
-b2-  and طَلِقُ الوَجْهِ: see طَلْقٌ.
طُلَقُ اللِّسَانِ: and لِسَانٌ طُلَقٌ ذُلَقٌ: see طَلْقٌ.
طُلُقٌ, (S, O, Msb, TA,) with two dammehs,
(Msb, TA,) or ↓ طَلْقٌ, (K,) but this requires
consideration, (TA,) Not shackled; applied to a
she-camel, (S, O, Msb, TA,) and to a he-camel,
(S, O, TA,) and to a person imprisoned; (O,
TA;) as also ↓ طَالِقٌ applied to a she-camel; but
طُلُقٌ is more common: (Aboo-Nasr, TA:) the
pl. of طُلُقٌ is أَطْلَاقٌ. (S, TA.) See also طَلْقٌ,
second sentence. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] لِسَانٌ طُلُقٌ ذُلُقٌ: ―
-b3-
and طُلُقُ اليَدَيْن: see طَلْقٌ again. ―
-b4-  And طُلُقُ
إِحْدَى اَلقَوَائِمِ (assumed tropical:)  A horse having one of the legs
without [the whiteness termed] التَّحْجِيل. (S.)
And طُلُقُ اليَدِ اليُمْنَى, (O,) or اليد اليمنى ↓ طُلْقُ,
(K, [in this case again deviating from other
authorities,]) (tropical:)  A horse without تَحْجِيل in the
right fore leg; (TA;) i. q. اليد اليمنى ↓ مُطْلَقُ.
(O, K, TA.) And اليَدَيْنِ ↓ مُطْلَقَ (assumed tropical:)  A horse
having the fore legs free from تحجيل. (Msb.)
―
-b5-  [As an epithet in which the quality of a subst.
is predominant,] طُلُقٌ, (Ibn-' Abbád, O,) or ↓ طَلْقٌ,
(K, [but this, as in the instances above, is
questionable,]) signifies (assumed tropical:)  A gazelle: (Ibn-' Abbád,
O, K:) so called because of the quickness of its
running: (O, * TA:) pl. أَطْلَاقٌ. (Ibn-'Abbád,
O, K.) ―
-b6-  And (assumed tropical:)  A dog of the chase: (K:)
because he is let loose; or because of the quickness of his running at the chase: (TA:) أَطْلَاقٌ
is mentioned by Ibn-' Abbád as signifying dogs of
the chase. (O.)
طَلْقَةٌ [A single divorce: used in this sense in
law-books]. (T and Msb in art. بت, &c.)
طُلَقَةٌ: see مِطْلَاقٌ.
طَلَاقٌ is the inf. n. of طَلَقَت said of a woman:
(Th, S, Mgh, O, K:) or the subst. therefrom:
(Msb:) or [rather] it is also a subst. in the sense
of تَطْلِيقٌ; (Mgh;) [whence,] طَلَاقُ المَرْأَةِ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The letting the wife go her way: (Lth,
O:) and it has two meanings: one is [the divorcing of the woman; i. e.] the dissolving of the
wife's marriage-tie: and the other is the leaving,
and dismissing, of the wife [either in an absolute
sense or as is done by a single sentence of
divorce]. (O, TA.) Some of the lawyers hold
that the free woman whose husband is a slave is
not separated but by three [sentences, as is the
case when both husband and wife are free]; and
the female slave whose husband is free, by two:
some, that the wife in the former case is separated
by two [sentences]; and in the latter case, by
not less than three: and some, that when the
husband is a slave and the wife is free, or the
reverse, or when both are slaves, the wife is
separated by two [sentences]. (TA.)
طَلِيقٌ A captive having his bond loosed from
him, (S, O, K, TA,) and let go. (TA.) See
also طَلْقٌ, first sentence. ―
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  A man freed
from slavery; emancipated; i. q. عَتِيقٌ; i. e.
who has become free: pl. طُلَقَآءُ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  It is
said in a trad., الطُّلَقَآءُ مِنْ قُرَيْشٍ وَالعُتَقَآءُ مِنْ ثَقِيفٍ
(assumed tropical:)  [The طُلَقَآء are of Kureysh; and the عُتَقَآء, of
Thakeef]: الطلقاء being app. applied to Kureysh
as it has a more special signification than العتقاء:
but accord. to Th, الطُّلَقَآءُ signifies those who
have been brought within the pale of El-Islám
against their will. (TA.) ―

طَلِيقُ الوَجْهِ: see طَلْقٌ again; the last in two places.
―
-b7-  طَلِيقُ الإِلٰهِ means (tropical:)  The wind. (O, K, TA.)
طَلَّاقٌ: see مِطْلَاقٌ.
طِلِّيقٌ: see مِطْلَاقٌ.
طَالِقٌ A she-camel not having having her fore
shank and her arm bound together: (TA:) or
not having upon her a خِطَام [or halter]: (IDrd,
O, K:) or repairing to the water; and so
↓ مِطْلَاقٌ; (Aboo-Nasr, K, TA;) of which latter
she pl. is مَطَالِيقُ: (TA:) or that is left a day
and a night and then milked: (K:) pl. طَوَالِقُ
and أَطْلَاقٌ and طَلَقَةٌ; which last is expl. by AA
as meaning she-camels that are milked in the
place of pasturing. (TA.) See also طُلُقٌ, first
sentence: and for an explanation of the pl. طَوَالِقُ
applied to camels, see طَلَقٌ, second sentence.
Also (O), طَالِقٌ, (S, O,) or طَالِقَةٌ, (K,) signifies
A she-camel which the pastor leaves for himself,
not milking her at the water: (S, O, K:) the
former is expl. by Esh-Sheybánee as meaning
one which the pastor leaves [with her udder bound]
with her صِرَار, not milking her in the place where
she lies down to rest: (TA:) or the latter signifies,
(Lth, O, K,) and the former also, (Lth, O,) a she-camel that is set loose among the tribe to pasture
where she will in any part of the tract adjacent to
their place of alighting or abode, (Lth, O, K, [من
جِنانِهِمْ in the CK being erroneously put for مِنْ
جَنَابِهِمْ,]) that has not her fore shank and her
arm bound together when she returns in the afternoon or evening, nor is turned away [from the
others] in the place of pasturage: (Lth, O:) or
طَالِقٌ signifies a she-camel, (S, Msb,) and a ewe,
(S,) that is set loose, or dismissed, to pasture
where she will: (S, Msb:) and also as first expl.
in this sentence: (S:) it is mentioned by ElFárábee as signifying a ewe left to pasture by
herself, alone. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] طَالِقٌ and
طَالِقَةٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) the former, without ة,
used by all, (Msb,) the latter occurring in a verse
of El-Aashà, (S, Mgh, * O, Msb,) ending a hemistich, and pronounced طَالِقَةٌ, (S, O, Msb, [which
cite the verse somewhat differently,]) (tropical:)  A woman
[divorced, or] left to go her way, (S, * Mgh, * O,
Msb, *) or separated from her husband [by a
sentence of divorce]: (S, * Mgh, * Mgh, * K, TA:)
both mentioned by Akh: (O, TA:) accord. to
IAmb, one says طَالِقٌ only, because it applies
only to a female: accord. to Lth and IF, طَالِقَةٌ
means طَالِقَةٌ غَدًا [divorced, &c., to-morrow]; and
Lth adds that it is thus to accord with its verb,
طَلَقَتْ: some, however, say that the ه is affixed
in the verse of El-Aashà by poetic license, to
complete the hemistich; but an Arab of the desert,
in reciting this verse to As, is related to have
said طَالِقٌ [which equally completes the hemistich]: and the Basrees hold that the sign of the
fem. gender is elided in طَالِقٌ because it is a possessive epithet, meaning ذَاتُ طَلَاقٍ [having
divorce]. (Msb.) ―
