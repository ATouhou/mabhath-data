طيف1
طَافَ الخَيَالُ, aor. يَطِيفُ, inf. n. طَيْفٌ (S,
O, Msb, K) and مَطَافٌ; (S, O, K;) thus says
As: (TA:) and طَافَ, aor. يَطُوفُ, inf. n. طَوْفٌ;
(O, K;) thus says El-Mufaddal: (O, TA:)
The خيال [i. e. apparition, or phantom,] came
(S, O, Msb, K) in sleep. (S, O, K.) And طاف
بِهِ الخَيَالُ The خيال came to him, or visited him,
(أَلَمَّ بِهِ,) in sleep. (TA in art. طوف,)
2
طيّف, inf. n. تَطْيِيفٌ, He went round or
round about, or circuited, much, or often; as also
طوّف: (K:) but, (TA,) IDrd says, ↓ اطاف
and طيّف and ↓ تطيّف are the same in meaning:
(O, TA:) therefore what is said in the K
requires consideration: ↓ تطيّف signifies as above.
(TA.)

اطاف: see the next preceding paragraph:
and see also art. طوف.

تَطَيَّفَ see 2, in two places.
طَيْفٌ An apparition, a phantom, a spectre, or
an imaginary form, (خَيَالٌ,) coming in sleep;
(IDrd, O, K;) one says طَيْفُ خَيَالٍ and ↓ طَائِفُ
خَيَالٍ [meaning thus]: (IDrd, O:) or anything
that obscures the sight, [arising] from a vain
suggestion of the Devil: (Lth, TA:) or a jinnee,
and a human being, and a خَيَال, that comes to,
or visits, a man [generally in sleep]; as also
↓ طَائِفٌ; so says IF in art. طوف: (Msb:) both of
these words signify alike; i. e. a thing like the
خَيَال; and a thing that comes to one, or visits
one: (Fr, TA:) and ↓ طِيفٌ, with kesr, signifies
a خَيَال itself: (Kr, TA:) or [طَيْفٌ is properly,
or originally, an inf. n.; and] طَيْفُ الخَيَالِ
signifies the coming of the خيال in sleep: (S, O,
K: *) accord. to El-Mufaddal, (O,) one says
طَيْفٌ as meaning طَائِفُ خَيَالٍ because it is originally [طَيْوِفٌ, and then] طَيِّفٌ; like مَيِّتٌ and
مَيْتٌ from مَاتَ, aor. يَمُوتُ. (O, K.) طَيْفُ
الشَّيْطَانِ and ↓ طَائِفُهُ signify The Devil's
visitation, by touch, or madness or insanity,
(بِالْمَسِّ,) or by vain prompting or suggestion:
(Msb:) or طَيْفٌ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ signifies A touch,
or slight degree, or somewhat [of a taint or an
infection], of insanity or possession, from the
Devil; syn. لَمَمٌ; occurring in the Kur vii. 200,
accord. to one reading; another reading being
مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ ↓ طَائِفٌ, which signifies the same.
(S, O. [See also طَوْفٌ.]) One says also طَيْفُ
جُنُونٍ [A touch, or slight degree, of insanity, or
diabolical possession]. (S, O.) And طَيْفٌ [alone]
signifies Insanity, or diabolical possession: (O,
K:) so says A 'Obeyd, on the authority of ElAhmar: (TA:) and this is said by Az to be
the meaning of the word in the language of
the Arabs. (O, TA.) ―
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  Anger: (I'Ab,
Mujáhid, O, K:) because the intellect of the
angry departs [for a time] so that he assumes the
the likeness of the insane, or possessed: (O,
TA:) said by I'Ab to mean thus in the Kur vii.
200. (TA.)
