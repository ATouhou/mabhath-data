أَطْرَطُ الحَاجِبَيْنِ A man destitute of eyebrows;
(AZ, S, O;) as also أَمْرَطُ الحلجبين; (O;) and
some say أَضْرَطُ, but Abu-l-Ghowth knew it not:
(S, O:) or having light, thin, or scanty, hair of
the eyebrows; and so الحَاجِبِيْنِ ↓ طَرِطُ: (K:) the
mention of the حَاجِبَانِ is indispensable; (AZ, S,
O, K;) but sometimes omitted, on the ground
of a weak authority: (K, TA:) and accord. to
Ibn-'Abbád, أَطْرَطُ signifies having thin eyebrows.

eyelashes. (O, K.)
