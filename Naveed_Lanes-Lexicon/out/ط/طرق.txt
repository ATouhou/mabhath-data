garments, [and one of the two coats of mail,] over

above, another; and so ↓ اِطَّرَقَ; (TA;) [and in

trample thee with their feet: (O:) it is like the
saying فَغُضِّ الطَّرْفَ. (S. [See also كَرَوَانٌ: and

asserted that when they desire to capture the كرا,
and see it from afar, they encompass it, and one
of them says, أَطْرِقْ كَرَا إِنَّكَ لَا تُرَى [or لَنْ تُرَى
(Meyd in explanation of the preceding prov.) i. e.
Lower thine eyes, or be silent, karà: thou wilt
not be seen:] until he becomes within reach of it;

is Cuirasses, from the Greek

like a cannon-ball, may still be seen, if they have
not been removed within the last few years, upon
several of the gates of Cairo; and if so, طَوَارِق
in this case is app. from طَرَقَ “ he beat: ” see
