طحن1
طَحَنَ البُرَّ, aor.
طَحَنَ, inf. n. طَحْنٌ, (S, Msb,
K,) said of a man, (S,) He ground the wheat;
i. e. he made the wheat into دَقِيق [i. e. flour];
and so [but app. in an intensive sense] ↓ طحّنهُ.
(K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence] one says, طَحَنَهُمْ فَأَهْلَكَهُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [He
crushed them and destroyed them]. (T and M and
K in art. دم.) And حَرْبٌ تَطْحَنُ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ (assumed tropical:)  [A
war that crushes every thing]. (TA. [See also
طَحُونٌ.]) And طَحَنَتْهُمُ المَنُونُ (assumed tropical:)  [Time, or
death, reduced them to dust]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And one
says also, طَحَنَتِ الرَّحَى [The mill-stone ground;
or revolved]. (S.) ―
-b4-  And [hence,] طَحَنَتِ الأَفْعَى
The viper turned round about; or coiled itself.
(S, K. *)

طَحَّنَ see the preceding paragraph, first sentence.
طَحْنٌ: see what next follows.
طِحْنٌ Flour; (S, MA, K;) as also ↓ طَحِينٌ:
(MA:) or ground wheat and the like; [or meal;]
and sometimes the inf. n., ↓ طَحْنٌ, is used in
this sense. (Msb.) Hence the prov., أَسْمَعُ
جَعْجَعَةً وَلَا أَرَى طِحْنًا [I hear a sound of the mill,
or mill-stone, but I see not flour]. (K.)
طُحَنٌ A certain small creeping thing, (دُوَيْبَّةٌ,
S, K, TA,) in form like [the species of lizard, or
reptile, called] أُمّ حُبَيْن, [see art. حبن,] but more
slender (أَلْطَفُ) than this latter, that raises its tail
like as does the pregnant camel, and, when bidden
to grind, by the children of the Arabs of the
desert, grinds with itself the ground until it becomes concealed in the soft soil; and one never
sees it but in a tract of ground such as is termed
بَلُّوقَة: Az says that ↓ طُحَنَةٌ signifies a certain
small creeping thing (دويبّة) like the [beetle called]
جُعَل; and that طُحَنٌ is the pl.: [but, properly
speaking, the latter is a coll. gen. n., and the
former is the n. un.:] As says that it is [a
creature] smaller than the hedge-hog, that comes
into existence in the sands, appearing sometimes,
and turning round as though grinding, and then
diving [into the sand]: (TA: [see also عَوَانَةٌ:])
and, (K,) accord. to Aboo-Kheyreh, (TA,) the
طُحَن is what is called لَيْثُ عِفِرِّينَ [q. v. in art.
عفر], (K, TA, in the CK لَيْثُ عِفْرِينَ,) resembling
the pistachio-nut, in colour like the dust, that
buries itself in the earth. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, app.,]
Short: (K:) [or] accord. to Zj, ↓ طُحَنَةٌ signifies
short, having in him لُوثَة [app. meaning stupidity,
or the like]; and IB says that he who is tall,
having in him لوثة, is termed عُسْقُدٌ: (TA:)
accord. to IAar, short in the utmost degree: (Az,
TA:) accord. to IKh, the shortest of the short;
and the tallest of the tall is termed سَمَرْ طُولٌ.
(TA.)
طُحَنَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
two places.
طَحُونٌ (assumed tropical:)  A war (حَرْبٌ) that crushes (تَطْحَنُ)
everything. (TA.) And [hence] الطَّحُونُ is a
name for (assumed tropical:)  War. (Az, K, * TA.) ―
-b2-  And [hence
also] (tropical:)  A كَتِيبَة [or troop] that crushes (تَطْحَنُ)
what it meets: (S, TA:) or a great كَتِيبَة: (K:)
or a كتيبة of horsemen, mighty, or valorous, and
numerous. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  Numerous camels;
as also ↓ طَحَّانَةٌ: (S, K:) or both signify camels
when they are [many, and are] such as are termed
رِفَاق, and have their owners with them; (TA;)
as also رَطُونٌ and رَطَّانَةٌ: (As, TA in art. رطن,
q. v.:) and the former, about three hundred
sheep or goats; (K;) accord. to Lh; but ISd
says, I know not any other who has mentioned
the طحون of sheep or goats. (TA.)
طَحِينٌ and ↓ مَطْحُونٌ (Msb, TA) and ↓ مُطَحَّنٌ
(TA) Ground wheat (Msb, TA) and the like
thereof. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  For the first, see also طِحْنٌ.
طِحَانَةٌ The craft, or occupation, of the طَحَّان
[or miller]. (K.)
طَحِينَةٌ The dregs of the oil of sesame. (TA.)
طَحَّانٌ [meaning A miller, or grinder of wheat
and the like,] is thus, perfectly decl., if you do
not derive it from الطَّحُّ: (K, TA:) i. e. طَحَّان,
if you derive it from الطَّحْنُ, is perfectly decl.;
but if you derive it from الطَّحُّ, or from الطَّحَا
which signifies “ the expanded tract of land,” it
is imperfectly decl.: (S, TA:) if from الطَّحُّ, it
is of the measure فَعْلَانُ, not فَعَّالٌ; and if from
الطَّحَا, it would be by rule طَحْوَانُ. (IB, TA.)
طَحَّانَةٌ: see طَاحُونَةٌ: ―
-b2-  and see also طَحُونٌ.
طَاحِنٌ The bull, of those that tread the wheat,
that stands [الَّذِى يَقُومُ, for which الَّّتِى تَقُومُ is
erroneously put in the K and TA,] in the middle
of the heap thereof and around which the other
bulls turn: (K, TA:) mentioned by En-Nadr,
on the authority of El-Jaadee. (TA.)
[
طَيْحَنٌ, mentioned by Freytag as meaning A
frying-pan (“ sartago ”), is evidently a mistranscription, for طَيْجَنٌ.]
طَاحِنَةٌ, (Msb, TA,) in which the ة is added
to give intensiveness to the signification, (Msb,)
[or to convert the epithet طَاحِنٌ into a subst.,]
sing. of طَوَاحِنُ, (Msb, TA,) which signifies
(assumed tropical:)  The أَضْرَاس [as meaning the molar teeth, or
grinders,] (S, Msb, K, TA) of a man and of
others; as being likened to a mill. (TA.)
طَاحُونٌ: see what next follows.
طَاحُونَةٌ A mill: (S, Msb, K:) [also called in
the present day ↓ طَاحُونٌ: and the same meaning
is assigned by Golius and Freytag, by the latter
as on the authority of the K, (in which I do not
find it,) to ↓ مِطْحَنَةٌ, pl. مَطَاحِنُ; and by Golius
to ↓ مِطْحَانٌ likewise:] or a mill that is turned by
water; (Lth, MA, Mgh;) as also ↓ طَحَّانَةٌ:
(Lth, Mgh, TA:) or this signifies a mill that is
turned by a beast [as طاحونة and طاحون do in
the present day]: (MA, Mgh:) pl. of the first
طَوَاحِينُ. (Msb, TA.)
[
مَطْحَنَةٌ is said by Golius, as on the authority
of the KL, (in which however I do not find it,)
to signify A place where grinding is performed.]
مِطْحَنَةٌ: see طَاحُونَةٌ.
مُطَحَّنٌ: see طَحِينٌ.
مِطْحَانٌ A viper turning round about; or
coiling itself. (S, K.) A poet says,
بِخَرْسَآءَ مِطْحَانٍ كَأَنَّ فَحِيحَهَا
إِذَا فَزِعَتْ مَآءٌ هُرِيقَ عَلَى جَمْرِ
[With a coiling viper, as though its hissing, when
it is frightened, were the sound of water poured
upon live coals]. (S, TA.) ―

what here follows:] طَحَا is said when one throws
down a man upon his face; (K, TA;) or when
he spreads, or extends, him; or when he prostrates him on the ground: (TA:) but accord. to
Fr, one says, ↓ شَرِبَ حَتَّى طَحَّى i. e. [He drank
until] he stretched out his legs: and البَعِيرُ ↓ طحّى
إِلَى الأَرْضِ i. e. The camel stuck to the ground,
either from emptiness or from emaciation: and
in like manner one says of a man when people
call him to aid or to do an act of kindness: the

as though, by saying this, he contradicted As as
to its being without teshdeed. (TA.) Accord.

away &c.]. (S.) And طَحَا بِهِ قَلْبُهُ His heart
carried him away (ذَهَبَ بِهِ) in [the pursuit of]
anything: (S, K:) whence the saying of Alkameh
Ibn-'Abadeh,

بُعَيْدَ الشَّبَابِ عَصْرَ حَانَ مَشِيبُ
[A heart much affected with emotion has carried
