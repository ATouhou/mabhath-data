sometimes changed to اِطَّيَّرَ, (S, A, Msb,) as in

He augured evil from it; regarded it as an evil
omen. (S, Msb, K.) The Arabs, when they
desired to set about an affair, passed by the
places where birds lay upon the ground, and
roused them, in order to learn thence whether
they should proceed or refrain: but the law
forbade this. (Msb.) They augured evil from
the croaking of the crow, and from the birds'
going towards the left; and in like manner, from

light spread in the horizon: (TA:) [see مُسْتَطِيرٌ:]
and the verb is used in the same sense in relation

in the horizon: and of dust, it spread in the air:
and of evil, it spread. (TA.) See also 6. ―
-b2-  (tropical:)  It
(a crack in a wall) appeared and spread. (A.
[See also استطال.]) It (a slit, or crack, for

[agreeing with an explanation of the same saying
voce حِنْوٌ, q. v.]. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also طَيْرَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A slip; a
stumble: hence the trad., إِيَّاكَ وَطَيْرَاتِ الشَّبَابِ

-b2-  See also مُسْتَطِيرٌ.
-A2-  Also A company
of men. (O.)
-A3-  As applied to A balance, it is
not of the language of the Arabs: (O:) [i. e., it
is post-classical:] it means an assay-balance
(مِيزَانٌ and مَعْيَارٌ) for gold; so called because of
the form of a bird, or because of its lightness: or
the balance for dirhems [or moneys] that is known
among them [who use it] by the appellation of the
قارسطون [meaning the
χαριστίων of Archimedes,
(as is observed in a note in p. 178 of vol. ii. of
the sec. ed. of Har,) i. e. the hydrostatic balance]:
or, accord. to El-Fenjedeehee, the tongue (لِسَات)
of the balance. (Har pp. 549-50.)
هُوَ طَيُّورٌ فَيُّورٌ (assumed tropical:)  He is sharp, and quick in
returning [to a good state], or recovering [from
his anger]. (K.) [See also طَيَّارٌ.]
طَائِرٌ A flying thing [whether bird or insect]:
(Msb, * TA:) pl. ↓ طَيْرٌ, (S, Msb, K,) like as
صَحْبٌ is pl. of صَاحِبٌ: (S, Msb:) or طَيْرٌ is
originally an inf. n. of طَارَ: or an epithet contracted from طَيِّرٌ: (TA:) or a quasi-pl. n.; (Mgh,
TA;) and this is the most correct opinion: (TA:)
[but see, below, a reason for considering it originally an inf. n.:] and طَائِرٌ may also be quasi-pl. n.,
like جَامِلٌ and بَاقِرٌ: (TA:) ↓ طَيْرٌ is also sometimes used as a sing.; (Ktr, AO, S, Mgh, Msb,
K;) as in the Kur iii. 43 [and v. 110], accord.
to one reading: (S:) but ISd says, I know not
how this is, unless it be meant to be [originally]
an inf. n.: (TA:) [for an inf. n. used as an
epithet is employed as sing. and pl.:] or طَائِرٌ,
only, is used as a sing., (Th, IAmb, Msb,) by
general consent; and AO once said so in common
with others: (Th:) but ↓ طَيْرٌ has a collective,
or pl., signification: (IAmb, Msb:) and is fem.:
(Mgh:) or is more frequently fem. than masc.:
(IAmb, Msb:) the pl. of طَيْرٌ is طُيُورٌ [a pl. of
mult.] and أَطْيَارٌ [a pl. of pauc.]: (S, Msb, K:)
or طُيُورٌ may be pl. of طَائِرٌ, like as سُجُودٌ is pl. of
سَاجِدٌ: (TA:) طَائِرَةٌ is seldom applied to the
female. (IAmb, Msb.) ―
-b2-  [الطَّائِر is a name of
(assumed tropical:)  The constellation Cygnus; also called الدَّجَاجَةُ.]
―
-b3-  هُوَ سَاكِنُ الطَّائِرِ means (tropical:)  He is grave, staid,
sedate, (K,) or motionless; so that if a bird
alighted upon him, it would be still; for if a bird
alight upon a man, and he move in the least, the
bird flies away. (TA.) Of the same kind also
is the saying, رُزِقَ فُلَانٌ سُكُونَ الطَّائِرِ وَخَفْضَ الجِنَاحِ
(tropical:)  [Such a one was endowed, or has been endowed,
with gravity and gentleness]. (TA.) And طُيُورُهُمْ
سَوَاكِنُ (tropical:)  They are remaining fixed, settled, or at
rest: and شَالَتْ نَعَامَتُهُمْ signifies the contrary.
(A, TA.) And ↓ كَأَنَّ عَلَى رُؤُسِهِمُ الطَّيْرَ (tropical:)  [As
though birds were on their heads] is said of a
people, meaning them to be motionless by reason
of reverence: (S, K:) it was said of the Companions of Mohammad, describing them as quiet
and grave [in his presence], without levity: and
the origin of the saying is this: that birds alight
only upon a thing that is still and inanimate:
(TA:) or that the crow alights upon the head of
the camel, and picks from it the ticks, (S, K,)
and the young ones thereof, (S,) and the camel
does not move (S, K) his head, (S,) lest the crow
should take fright and fly away. (S, K.) In
like manner, وَقَعَ طَائِرُهُ means (tropical:)  He became grave,
or sedate. (Meyd.) And طَائِرُهُ ↓ طَارَ (tropical:)  He became light, or inconstant: (Meyd:) and he became
angry; (O, K, TA;) like ثَارَ ثَائِرُهُ and فَارَ فَائِرُهُ:
(TA:) or he hastened, and was light, or active,
or agile. (Har p. 561.) ―
-b4-  And it is said in a
trad., الرُّؤْيَا عَلَى رِجْلِ طَائِرٍ مَا لَمْ تُعَبَّرْ (O, TA)
(assumed tropical:)  A dream is unsettled as to its result, or final
sequel, while it is not interpreted. (TA.) [The
Arabs hold that the result of a dream is affected
by its interpretation: wherefore it is added in
this tradition, and said in others also, that the
dreamer should not relate his dream, unless to a
friend or to a person of understanding.] ―
-b5-
↓ عَيَّثَتْ طَيْرُهُ see expl. in art. عيث. ―
-b6-  طَائِرٌ also
signifies A thing from which one augurs either
good or evil; an omen, a bodement, of good or of
evil: (K:) and ↓ طِيَرَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ طِيرَةٌ (K)
and ↓ طِوَرَةٌ (IDrd, Sgh, K, TA [in the CK, in
this art., erroneously, طُورَةٌ, but in art. طور it is
طِوَرَة,]) a thing from which one augurs evil; an
evil omen or bodement; (S, K, &c.;) contr. of
فَأْلٌ: (TA:) and طَائِرٌ signifies fortune, (A'Obeyd,
K, TA,) whether good or evil: (TA:) and especially
evil fortune; ill luck; as also ↓ طَيْرٌ and ↓ طِيَرَةٌ:
for the Arabs used to augur evil from the croaking of the crow, and from birds going towards
the left: [see 5:] (TA:) and ↓ طِيَرَةٌ is an inf. n.
[or rather a quasi-inf. n.] of تَطَيَّرَ, [q. v.,] (IAth,)
and signifies auguration of evil. (Msb.) The Arabs
used to say, to a man or other thing from which
they augured evil, (TA,) طَائِرُ اللّٰهِ لَا طَائِرُكَ, (ISk,
S, IAmb,) and طائرَ اللّٰه لا طائرَك, meaning What
God doth and decreeth, not what thou dost and
causest to be feared: (IAmb:) accord. to ISk,
one should not say اللّٰهِ ↓ طَيْرُ: (S:) but the Arabs
are related to have said, also, لَا طَيْرَ إِلَّا طَيْرُ اللّٰهِ
[There is no evil fortune but that which is of
God]; like as one says, لَا أَمْرَ إِلَّا أَمْرُ اللّٰهِ. (As,
S.) They also used to say, جَرَى لَهُ الطَّائِرُ بِأَمْرِ كَذَا
[Fortune brought to him such an event]: and
hence fortune, whether good or evil, is called
طائر. (TA.) And it is said in the Kur [vii.
128], إِنَّمَا طَائِرُهُمْ عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ, meaning Their evil
fortune, which will overtake them, is only that
which is threatened to befall them in the latter
state, [with God,] and not that which befalls them
in the present state of existence: (TA:) or the
cause of their good and evil is only with God;
i. e., it is his decree and will: or the cause of
their evil fortune is only with God; i. e., it is
their works, which are registered with Him.
(Bd.) It is said in a trad., that Mohammad
liked what is termed فَأْل, and disliked what is
termed ↓ طِيَرَة: (S:) and in another, that he
denied there being any such thing as the latter.
(TA.)
-A2-  Also The means of subsistence; syn.
رِزْقٌ. (K:) or misery: or happiness: every one
of these three significations has been assigned to it
in the Kur xvii. 14: in which, accord. to AM,
it is meant that God has decreed to every man
happiness or misery, according as He foresaw
that he would be obedient or disobedient. (TA.)
[See also what immediately follows.]
-A3-  Also
The actions of a man which are [as it were] attached as a necklace to his neck. (S, Msb, K.)
And this is [also said by some to be] its signification in the Kur xvii. 14. (Jel.) [The actions
of a man are the cause of his happiness or
misery.]
-A4-  الطَّائِرُ signifies also The brain. (AAF,
L, K.)
أَطْيَرُ مِنْ عُقَابٍ [More swift of flight than an
eagle] is a prov. said of an عقاب because it may be
in the morning in El-' Irák and in the evening in
El- Yemen. (Meyd.)
مَطَارٌ [A place to or from which a bird or other
thing flies: in the phrase طَارَ قَلْبِى مَطَارَهُ, (see 1,)
it lit. signifies a place to which one would fly:] a
place of flying. (TA.) ―
-b2-  أَرْضٌ مَطَارَةٌ [and ↓ مُطِيرَةٌ
(see 4)] A land abounding with birds. (S, K.)
-A2-  حَفْرٌ مَطَارٌ, (O,) and بِئْرٌ مَطَارَةٌ, (O, K,) [A pit,
or cavity, and a well,] wide in the mouth. (O, K.)
مُطَارٌ Made to fly away: En-Nábighah says,
وَلِرَهْطِ حَرَّابٍ وَقَدٍّ سُورَةٌ
فِى المَجْدِ لَيْسَ غُرَابُهُ بِمُطَارِ
[And to the family of Harráb and Kadd belongs
an eminence in glory of which they fear not any
diminution: lit., of which the crow is not made
to fly away; the greatness of their glory being
likened to abundant seed-produce, as has been
shown above: see 2]: (S:) A 'Obeyd says that
Harráb and Kadd were two men of the BenooAsad. (TA in art. قد.) ―
-b2-  See also طَيَّارٌ.
مُطِيرَةٌ: see مَطَارٌ.

بُرْد (O, K) having upon it the forms of birds.

preparation thereof: (AHn, TA:) or such as is
مُطَرًّى [i. e. mixed with some other odoriferous
substance]; formed by transposition from the
latter word; (O, K;) but this pleased not ISd:
(TA:) or aloes-wood split and broken in pieces.
(O, K. *)
مُسْتَطَارٌ [Made to fly. ―
-b2-  And hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A
horse that hastens, or is quick, in running: (K:)
that runs quickly. (TS, L.) It is contracted by
the poet 'Adee into مُسْطَار, or مُصْطَار. (TA.)
And مُسْطَارٌ for مُسْتَطَارٌ is applied as an epithet to
wine. (TA. [No ex. is there given to indicate the meaning.])
مُسْتَطِيرٌ (tropical:)  Spreading; applied to dust; as also
↓ طَيَّارٌ; (TA;) and to hoariness; and to evil:
(L:) rising and spreading; (K;) whereof the
light spreads in the horizon; applied to the true
dawn, which renders it unlawful to the faster to
eat or drink or indulge in other carnal pleasure,
and on the appearance of which the prayer of
daybreak may be performed, and which is termed
الخِيْطُ الأَبْيَضُ: that to which the epithet مُسْتَطِيل
is applied is [the false dawn,] that which is
likened to the tail of the wolf (ذَنَبُ السِّرْحَانِ),
and is termed الخِيْطُ الأَسْوَدُ; and this does not
render anything unlawful to the faster. (TA.)
―
-b2-  Also A dog excited by lust; (Lth, O, K;)

this sense to the latter is هَائِجٌ. (Lth, O, TA.)
