طَفَّ, (As, O, K,) [aor., app.,
طَفِ3َ,] inf. n.
طَفٌّ, (TK, [or, accord. to Freytag طُفُوفٌ, which see
in what follows,]) It (a thing) was, or became, near.
(As, O, K.) You say, أَخَذْتُ مِنْ مَتَاعِى مَا خَفَّ
وَطَفَّ i. e. [I took, of my goods,] what [was light,
and] was near to me. (As, O.) And طَفَّ الشَّىْءُ مِنَ
الشَّىْءِ The thing was, or became, near to the
thing. (O, K. *) And خُذْ مَا طَفَّ لَكَ, and
لَكَ ↓ اسْتَطَفَّ, (S, Meyd, O, K,) and لَكَ ↓ أَطَفَّ,
(Meyd, O, TA,) Take thou what has risen to
thee, and become within thy power or reach, (S,
O, K, TA,) and become attainable [to thee], or
prepared [for thee], (AZ, Meyd, TA,) and become near to thee: (K, TA:) or what has risen
to view, and has appeared, [to thee,] to be taken:
(TA:) [for] طَفَّ, inf. n. طُفُوفٌ, signifies it rose
[app. so as to become visible]: and it was, or
became, little in quantity: the saying is a prov.,
relating to a man's being content with a part of
that which he wants: (Meyd:) and in like
manner one says, خُذْ مَا دَفَّ لَكَ, and اسْتَدَفَّ:
(AZ, Meyd, TA:) and Ks mentions, in relation
to a man's being content with a part of that
which he wants, the saying, خُذْ مَا طَفَّ لَكَ وَدَعْ
لَكَ ↓ مَا اسْتَطَفَّ [app. meaning, if the saying be
correctly thus related, Take what is within thy
power, or reach, and leave what has risen to thy
view so as to invite approach]; i. e. be content with what is within thy power. (TA.) ―

them. (O.) ―

arm or hand. (O, K.) And طَفَّ بِفُلَانٍ مَوْضِعَ

made him to be on a level with it. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And
طَفَّ الحَائِطَ, inf. n. طَفٌّ, He mounted upon the

طفّف He made defective, or deficient. (TA.)
You say, طفّف, (K,) or طفّف المِكْيَالَ, and
المِيزَانَ, (Msb,) inf. n. تَطْفِيفٌ, (S, O, Msb,) He
gave short measure, and short weight; (Msb;)
he made the contents of the measure to be defective,
(S, O, Msb, K,) and in like manner, of the
balance; (Msb;) not filling the former to its
uppermost parts: (S, TA:) i. e. he did thus,
cheating his companion in measure or in weight.
(TA.) [Hence,] طفّف عَلَى عِيَالِهِ (tropical:)  He scanted
his household, stinted them, or was niggardly or
parsimonious towards them, in expenditure. (TA.)

-b2-  Also He made full, or complete. (TA.) [Thus it has two contr. significations.]
-A2-  طفّفت الشَّمْسُ (tropical:)  The sun drew near
to setting: (TA:) [but this may be a mistranscription for ↓ طَفَّت, mentioned by Golius in this
sense on the authority of Z: or each may be
correct: that the latter is correct, and that
↓ طَفَافٌ or ↓ طِفَافٌ is its inf. n., seems to be indicated by the fact that SM adds immediately
after the explanation of the former phrase,]
أَتَانَا عِنْدَ طفافِ الشَّمْسِ means (tropical:)  [He came to us]
at the sun's drawing near to setting. (TA.) ―
-b2-
طفّف, said of a bird, [or ↓ طَفَّ, mentioned by
Freytag from Hamaker's Specim. catal. p. 49,
1. 4, of the Arabic text, or both may be correct,]
The bird expanded his wings: (O, K:) so says
Ibn-'Abbád. (O.) ―
-b3-  And طفّف بِهِ الفَرَسُ (tropical:)  The
horse leaped with him. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.
[Golius has omitted this; and has assigned to
طفّف, followed by ب with the person who is the
object, as on the authority of the S and K, the
signification of ادنا (properly أَدْنَى), meaning
“ prope admovit,” a signification belonging to
أَطَفَّ, but not assigned to either of these verbs in
the S nor in the K.]) طَفَّفَ بِىَ الفَرَسُ مَسْجِدَ بَنِى
زُرَيْقٍ, in a saying of Ibn-'Omar respecting a
horse-race, means (tropical:)  The horse leaped with me
(S, O, TA) so that he passed beyond the mosque
of the Sons of Zureyk. (O, TA.)

-b2-  And i. q.

مُطَفِّفٌ One who gives short measure, and short
weight, (Zj, Msb, TA,) thus cheating his companion; but this epithet is not applied unrestrictedly except in the case of exorbitant deficiency: [or] accord. to Aboo-Is-hák [i. e. Zj], the
مطفّف is thus called because he seldom or never
steals from the measure or balance save what is
paltry, i. e. طَفِيف; for it is from طَفُّ الشَّىْءِ,
meaning “ the side of the thing: ” the pl. occurs
in the Kur lxxxiii. 1. (TA.)
