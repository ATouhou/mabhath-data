طب1
طَبَّ, aor.
طَبُ3َ, (O, Msb, K, TA,) agreeably
with analogy in the case of a trans. reduplicative
verb [like this], (TA,) and
طَبِ3َ, (K, TA,) which is
irregular, (TA,) inf. n. طَبٌّ (O, * Msb, K, * TA)
[and app. طِبٌّ and طُبٌّ also accord. to the O
and K, but, accord. to the Msb, طِبٌّ is the subst.
from this verb, and app. طُبٌّ is likewise a simple
subst.], He treated medically, therapeutically, or
curatively, (O, * Msb, K, *) another person (O,
Msb) [or the body, and in like manner the soul:
see طِبٌّ, below]. ―
-b2-  And طَبيْتَ, with kesr, (S,
O, K,) and طَبَبْتَ, with fet-h, (O, K,) [third pers.
of each طَبَّ, and, accord. to analogy, the aor. of
the former is
طَبَ3َ, and of the latter
طَبِ3َ, but from what
follows it seems probable that one says also طَبُبْتَ
in the same sense, aor.
طَبُ3َ, unless طَبَبْتَ have تَطُتُّ
as an irreg. aor.,] Thou wast, or becamest a
طَبِيت [or physician], not having been such. (S,
O, K.) One says, إِنْ كُنْتَ ذَا طُبٍّ فَطُبَّ لِعَيْنَيْكَ,
(S, O, and so in copies of the K,) or لِعَيْنِكَ, (so
in other copies of the K,) or لِنَفْسِكَ, (ISk, TA,)
and ذا طَبٍّ, and ذا طِبٍّ, (S, K,) and فَطَبَّ, and
فَطِبَّ; (K;) [i. e. If thou be a possessor of the
art, or science, of physic, be a physician to thine
eyes, or thine eye, or thyself;] meaning, begin by
rectifying thyself. (ISk, TA. [See also Freytag's
Arab. Prov. ii. 902.]) ―
-b3-  And [hence] طَبَّ
signifies also (assumed tropical:)  He acted with skill, or expertness:
[and in this sense likewise the second pers. is
probably طَبِبْتَ and طَبَبْتَ and طَبُبْتَ, of which
last the inf. n. is app. طَبَابَةٌ, occurring in one of
the phrases here following:] so in the saying,
اِصْنَعْهُ صَنْعَةَ مَنْ طَبَّ لِمَنْ حَبَّ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Do thou it
in the manner of him who acts with skill, or
expertness, for him whom he loves: a prov.,
relating to the accomplishing an object of want
skilfully and well. (El-Ahmar, TA. [See also
Freytag's Arab. Prov. i. 717.]) One says also,
اِعْمَلْ فِى هٰذَا عَمَلَ مَنْ طَبَّ لِمَنْ حَبَّ (assumed tropical:)  [Do
thou, in this, the deed of him who acts with skill,
or expertness, for him whom he loves]. (M, Msb, *
TA.) And مَنْ حَبَّ طَبَّ, (Meyd,) or مَنْ أَحَبَّ
طَبَّ, (K,) (assumed tropical:)  He who loves is skilful, or intelligent, and exercises art, or ingenuity, for him
whom he loves: (Meyd:) or (assumed tropical:)  he who loves
executes affairs with deliberateness and gentleness.
(K.) [That one says طَبُبْتَ, as well as طَبِبْتَ
and طَبَبْتَ, seems to be indicated by the fact that
↓ طَبَابَةٌ, as an inf. n., is thus written, in a copy of
the KL in my possession, and expl. as meaning
The medical art: Golius, however, appears to
have found it written, in a copy of the same
work, ↓ طِبَابَةٌ, which is agreeable with analogy
as inf. n. of a verb of the measure فَعَلَ significant
of an art, and is probably correct: Freytag
mentions the pl. طَبَائِبُ as signifying medical
arts, on the authority of the Deewán of the
Hudhalees.] ―
-b4-  طَبَّهُ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He enchanted him, or fascinated him: (O:) and طُبَّ
(tropical:)  he (a man, S, A) was enchanted, or fascinated.
(S, A, O. [See also طِبٌّ, below.]) ―
-b5-  طَبَّ السِّقَآءَ,
aor.
طَبُ3َ, (S, TA,) inf. n. طَبٌّ; (K, TA;) and
↓ طبّبهُ, with teshdeed to denote muchness, (S,
TA,) inf. n. تطْبِيبٌ; (K, TA;) He covered the
seams of the water-skin, or milk-skin, with a
طِبَابَة [q. v.]: (S, K, * TA:) and طَبَّ الخُرَزَ he
covered the seams with a طِبَابَة: (TA) [and]
المَزَادَة ↓ طَبَّبَتِ she (a girl, or young woman,)
put [or sewed] a piece of skin called ↓ طِبَابٌ and
↓ طِبَابَةٌ, upon the place of junction [of each] of the
two extremities of the loop-shaped handles of the
مزادة [or leathern water-bag]; as though she
rectified the مزادة thereby. (A.)
2
طَبَّ3َ see the last sentence above, in two places.
―
-b2-  تَطْبِيبٌ also signifies The inserting a بَنِيقَة [or
gore] for the purpose of widening دِيبَاج [or silk
brocade]: (K, TA:) or, as in the A, one says of
a tailor, طبّبِ الثَّوْبَ, meaning he added, in the
garment, a بَنِيقَة [or gore], in order that it might
become [more] wide. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also The hanging
a سِقَآء [or milk-skin] (S, K, TA) to a pole (عَمُود,
S, this is the right word, not عُود [as in copies of
the K], TA) of the tent, (S,) and then agitating
it to produce the butter: (S, K, TA:) but Az
says, I have not heard تطبيب explained in this
sense except on the authority of Lth, and I think
that it is تطنيب. (TA.)
3
مُطَابَّةٌ signifies (tropical:)  The seeking, or labouring,
to find the means of accomplishment [of an affair,
like as the physician seeks to find the means of
curing a disease]; syn. مُدَاوَرَةٌ. (K, TA.) One
says, أَنَا أُطَابُّ هٰذَا الأَمْرَ مُنْذُ حِينٍ كَىْ أَبْلُغَهُ (tropical:)  [I
have been seeking, or labouring, to find the means
of accomplishing this affair, that I might attain
to it]. (A, TA.)
4
مَا أَطَبَّهُمْ How [knowing, or] skilful, or
expert, are they! (Meyd, in explaining a prov.
cited below, voce طَبٌّ.)
5
تطبّب He applied himself to the science of
physic: (TA:) [or he applied himself to the
science of physic but did not know it well: (see
the part. n., below:)] or he practised physic:
and he professed physic. (KL.) ―
-b2-  And تطبّب لَهُ
He inquired of [or consulted] the physicians for
him. (TA.)
10
استطبّ لِوَجَعِهِ He asked, or sought, a
medical prescription for his pain, or disease. (S,
A, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  And جَآءَ يَسْتَطِبُّ لإِبِلِهِ (tropical:)  He
came asking, or seeking, for his she-camels, a
gentle stallion, that would not injure them. (A.)
R. Q. 1
طَبْطَبَ, (Lth, K, TA,) inf. n. طَبْطَبَةٌ,
(Lth, TA,) said of a valley, or water-course,
(Lth, K, TA,) It flowed with water so that one
heard it to make a sound like طَبْ طَبْ: (Lth,
TA:) or it made a sound (K, TA) with the
water. (TA.) طَبْطَبَةٌ signifies The sounding of
water (IAar, S, K, TA) when in a state of commotion and collision, (IAar, TA,) and of the like,
(S, TA,) and of the dashing of a torrent. (K.)
And ↓ تَطَبْطَبَ It made a sound, or noise, [like
طَبْ طَبْ,] said of water and the like, (S,) and
of a woman's breast: (TA:) a poet says,
إِذَا طَحَنَتْ دُرْنِيَّةٌ لِعِيَالِهَا
تَطَبْطَبَ ثَدْيَاهَا فَطَارَ طَحِينُهَا
[When a woman of Durnà grinds for her family,
her breasts make a sound by their collision, and
her flour flies away]. (S, TA.)
-A2-  طَبْطَبَ المَآءَ He
put the water into a state of commotion. (TA.)
R. Q. 2
تَطَبْطَبَ: see the next preceding
paragraph.
طَبٌّ: see طِبٌّ.
-A2-  It is also an inf. n. used as
an epithet: see طَبِيبٌ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  And, (S, A,
Msb, K,) as such, i. e. an inf. n. used as an
epithet, or by original application, but the former
is app. the case, and some have mentioned likewise ↓ طبٌّ and ↓ طُبٌّ, (MF, TA,) (tropical:)  Knowing,
or possessing knowledge, (S, A, Msb, TA,) respecting a thing, or of a thing; (A, Msb, TA;)
and so ↓ طَبِيبٌ: (TA:) and (TA) (assumed tropical:)  skilful, or
expert; (T, K;) as also ↓ طَبِيبٌ: (T, S, K:) and
(tropical:)  gentle; (Nh, TA;) and so too ↓ طَبِيبٌ. (TA.)
One says, فُلَانٌ طَبٌّ بِكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is knowing
with regard to, or is one possessing knowledge of,
such a thing. (TA.) And القَوْمُ طَبُّونَ, or, as
some relate it, ↓ القَوْمُ مَا أَطَبُّونَ, is a prov.: the
former means (assumed tropical:)  The people, or party, are knowing,
or skilful, or expert: and [Meyd says,] I know
not any way in which the latter is explainable
unless ↓ أَطَبُّ be syn. with طَبٌّ, like أَخْشَنُ and
خَشِنٌ, &c., and ما a connective. (Meyd.) To a
man who offered to cure the [so-called] seal, or
stamp, of the prophetic office between the Prophet's shoulder-blades, asserting himself to be a
طَبِيب [or physician], the Prophet replied, ↓ طَبِيبُهَا
الَّذِّى خَلَقَهَا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He who has knowledge
respecting it is He who created it. (TA.) And
El-Marrár El-Fak'asee says,
تَدِينُ لِمَزْرُورٍ إِلَى جَنْبِ حَلْقَةٍ
↓ مِنَ الشِّبْهِ سَوَّاهَا بِرِفْقٍ طَبِيبُهَا
(assumed tropical:)  [She obeys a plaited nose-rein attached to the
side of a ring of brass, the skilful maker of which
has fashioned it with gentleness]: (S, L:) i. e. the
she-camel of which he speaks obeys her rein that
is tied to her nose-ring of brass. (L.) [Hence,]
فَحْلٌ طَبٌّ (assumed tropical:)  A stallion [camel] expert in covering,
(S, Msb, K, TA,) as also ↓ طَبِيبٌ; (Msb;) that
knows the she-camel that is pregnant from her
that is not, and her that desires the stallion from
her that is covered without desire, and the motion
of the fœtus in the womb, &c.: (TA:) or (tropical:)  that
is gentle, and does not injure the female that he
covers. (A, TA.) And بَعِيرٌ طَبٌّ (tropical:)  A camel that
is mindful, or careful, as to the place of his foot,
(A, K, TA,) where to tread with it: or that does
not place his foot save where he sees. (TA.)
طُبٌّ: see the next paragraph:
-A2-  and see also
طَبٌّ.
طِبٌّ (S, A, O, Msb, K) and ↓ طَبٌّ and ↓ طُبٌّ
(S, A, O, K,) Medical, therapeutical, or curative,
treatment, (A, * O, * Msb, K, *) of the body, [i. e.
the physicking thereof,] (A, K,) and likewise of

-b2-  [And Knowledge]. قَرُبَ طِبٌّ
[Knowledge is near], or, as some relate it, قَرُبَ
طِبًّا, (Meyd, O, K, TA,) with the noun in the
accus. case, as a specificative, (TA,) like the
phrase نِعْمَ رَجُلًا, (Meyd, O, TA,) is a prove.:
originally said by a woman to a man who asked
her an indecent question which he was himself
about to resolve: (Meyd, O, K, TA:) it is like
the saying, أَنْتَ عَلَى المُجَرَّبِ [q. v.]: (Meyd,
TA:) and is related on the authority of Ibn-Háni. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And Skill, or expertness. (T,
ISd, Meyd, TA.) This is said in the T to be
the primary signification. (TA. [But see طَبِيبٌ.])
―
-b4-  And (tropical:)  Gentleness; gentle treatment or conduct.
(K, TA.) ―
-b5-  And (tropical:)  Enchantment, or fascination:
(S, O, K, TA: but only طِبٌّ is mentioned in this
sense in the S and O:) used in this sense as
ominating cure. (AO, O, * TA.) ―
-b6-  And طِبٌّ
signifies also Desire, or appetence; syn. شَهْوَةٌ:
and will, or wish; syn. إِرَادَةٌ. (K.) ―
-b7-  And
(tropical:)  State, condition, or case; syn. شَأْنٌ, (K, TA,)
and دَأْبٌ: (A, TA:) [or by the latter of these
two words may be meant what here follows:]
custom, habit, or wont. (S, K, TA.) One says,
مَاذَاكَ بِطِبِّى (tropical:)  That is not my custom, habit, or
wont. (S, A, TA.) [See also another ex., in a
verse (added here in the S and TA) which I have
cited voce إِنْ, page 107, col. iii.]

طَبٌّ.
طُبَّةٌ: see طِبَابَةٌ, in two places.
طِبَّةٌ An oblong piece, or portion, of a garment,

(A;) and likewise of skin: or a square piece of
the latter: and a round piece in a مَزَادَة and a
سُفْرَة and the like: (TA:) pl. طِبَبٌ: (S:) and,
as also ↓ طِبَابَةٌ, (As, S, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  a streak in sand
and clouds, (As, TA,) or a streak of sand or
clouds: (S:) or طِبَّةٌ and ↓ طِبَابَةٌ and ↓ طَبِيبَةٌ
signify an oblong piece, or portion, of a garment
or piece of cloth, and of skin, and (assumed tropical:)  of land or
ground, and (assumed tropical:) of clouds: (K:) or, all three
words, a long strip of a garment or piece of
cloth, and of skin, and (assumed tropical:)  of sand, and (assumed tropical:)  of clouds:
(TA:) and (assumed tropical:)  a long and narrow tract of land
abounding with plants or herbage: (AHn, TA;
and A in explanation of the first word:) pl. [of
the first] طِبَبٌ and [of the same, or of the third,
or a coll. gen. n. of which the second word is
the n. un.,] ↓ طِبَابٌ. (K.) And sometimes طِبَّةٌ
is applied to The piece that is sewed upon the edge
of the leathern bucket and upon that of the سُفْرَة:
and the pl. is طِبَبٌ and ↓ طِبَابٌ. (M, TA.) طِبَبُ
شُعَاعِ الشَّمْسِ (As, S, TA) and ↓ الطِّبَابُ, (As, TA,)
or طِبَبُ الشَّمْسِ and ↓ طِبَابُهَا, (A, TA,) signify
(tropical:)  The streaks that are seen in the rays, or beams,
of the sun when it rises. (As, S, A, * TA.) ―
-b2-
Also (tropical:)  i. q. نَاحِيَةٌ [i. e. A side; or a region,
quarter, or tract; &c.]: (so in a copy of the
A:) or i. q. نَاصِيَةٌ [i. e. a forelock; &c.]. (So
in the TA.) [One of these two explanations is
app. a mistranscription for the other.] ―
-b3-  And
one says, إِنَّكَ لَتَلْقَى فُلَانًا عَلَى طِبَبٍ مُخْتَلِفَةٍ,
meaning, عَلَى أَلْوَانٍ (tropical:)  [i. e. Verily thou wilt find
such a one to be of various moods, dispositions, or
characters]. (A, TA.)
طِبَابٌ [like عِلَاجٌ] A thing that is used for
medical, or curative, treatment: so in the saying,
ذَا طِبَابُ هٰذِهِ العِلَّةِ [This, or that, is what is used
for the medical, or curative, treatment of this

-A2-  See also طِبَّةٌ, latter half,
in four places. And see طِبَابَةٌ, in five places:
and 1, last sentence.

therapeutical, or curative, treatment]; (S, TA;)
or one who practises medical, therapeutical, or
curative, treatment; (Msb;) and ↓ مُتَطَبِّبٌ signifies [likewise one who practises physic: and a
professor of physic: (see its verb:) or] one who
applies himself to the science of physic: (S, K,
TA:) or one who applies himself to that science
but does not know it well: (Nh, TA:) it has
been said that the طَبِيب is so called from the
same epithet as signifying “ skilful, or expert; ”
but this is not a valid assertion: (TA:) the pl.
(of pauc., S) is أَطِبَّةٌ (S, K) and (of mult., S)
أَطِبَّآءُ. (S, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  The first of these words
(طبيب) occurs in a trad. as meaning (tropical:)  A judge;
being metonymically thus used, because the office
of him who judges between litigants is like that of
the طبيب who cures diseases of the body. (TA.)
[And hence, طَبِيبُ العَرَبِ: see فَقِيهُ العَرَبِ, in art.
فقه.] See also طَبٌّ, in six places.

طِبَابَةٌ: see 1, latter half.
-A2-  Also A piece of
skin with which the seams of a سِقَآء are covered,
extending across, [so I render مُعْتَرِضَةٌ, app. meaning from side to side, for one edge of the skin
beneath overlaps the other,] like the finger [in
breadth], doubled [but see what is said below on
the authority of AZ] over the place of the sewing:
pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.] ↓ طِبَابٌ: (As, S, TA:)
or that which is put over the place where the two
edges of the skin meet, when it is sewed, in the
lower part of the قِرْبَة and of the سِقَآء and of the
إِدَاوَة: so says As: or, as also ↓ طِبَابٌ, the piece of
skin that is put over the two edges of the skin, in
these things, when it is laid flat and then sewed,
without being doubled: (TA:) accord. to AZ,
when the [piece of] skin, in the lower parts of
these things, is doubled, and then sewed, it is
called عِرَاقٌ; and when it is laid flat and then
sewed, without being doubled, it is called
↓ طِبَابٌ: (TA; and the like is said in the S in
art. عرق:) or طِبَابَةٌ and عِرَاقٌ both signify, accord.
to As, a piece of skin with which the punctures
of the seams are covered: (S in art. عرق:) or a
طِبَابَة is a wide strip of skin, in which is the
sewing: and the pl. [or coll. gen. n.] is ↓ طِبَابٌ:
(M, TA:) or, accord. to the K, a strip of skin
that is in the lower part of a قِرْبَة, between the two
seams; as also ↓ طُبَّةٌ: but in this explanation,
its author has confounded the words of Lth, who
says that طِبَابَةٌ signifies the strip of the skin that
is between the two seams; and ↓ طُبَّةٌ, the strip of
skin that is in the lower part of the قِرْبَة, and that
contracts the seams [so I render يقارب الخرز,
but the meaning of this phrase is not, to me,
clear]. (TA.) See also 1, last sentence. ―
-b2-  And
see طِبَّةٌ, in two places. ―
-b3-  Also, and ↓ طِبَابٌ,
(K, TA, in the CK طَباب and طَبابة,) [or the
latter is a coll. gen. n.,] (assumed tropical:)  A streak, or narrow
elongated tract, of the sky: (K, TA:) [and app.
any portion of the sky not of large extent:] an
ex. of the latter word occurs in a verse cited voce
مَرَاكِدُ: and in another verse, a man in a prison
is described as seeing only a طِبَابَة of the sky like
a shield; i. e. a round portion thereof. (Az, TA.)
طَبِيبَةٌ, see طِبَّةٌ, in two places.
طِبِّىٌّ Medical, therapeutical, or curative; of,
or relating to, medical, therapeutical, or curative,
treatment. (Msb.)
طَبْطَبَةٌ A certain broad thing, one part of which
is struck with another part thereof. (TA.)
طَبْطَبِيَّةٌ A [kind of whip, or scourge, such as is
called] دِرَّة [q. v.]: (K, TA:) because the sound
that is made by its fall is like طَبْ طَبْ. (TA.)
طَبْطَابٌ A certain bird, or flying thing, (طَائِرٌ,)
having large ears. (K.)
طَبْطَابَةٌ, or طِبْطَابَةٌ, (accord. to different copies
of the K,) A broad piece of wood, with which one
plays with the ball, (K, TA,) or with which the
horseman plays with the ball. (T, TA.)
الطَّبَاطِبُ The عَجَم [i. e. Persians, or
foreigners]. (L, TA.)
أَطَبُّ; and its pl., أَطَبُّونَ: see طَبٌّ.
مَطْبُوبٌ (tropical:)  A man enchanted, or fascinated.
(S, A.)
مُتَطَبِّبٌ: see طَبِيبٌ.
