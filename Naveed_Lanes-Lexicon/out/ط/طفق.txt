طفق1
طَفِقَ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا, (S, Mgh, O, K,) aor.
طَفَقَ;
(S, K;) and طَفَقَ, aor.
طَفِقَ, (S, O, K,) mentioned
by Akh, (S, ISd, O,) and by Zj, (ISd, TA,) as
said by some, (S, O,) but pronounced by Lth to
be bad; (TA;) inf. n. طَقَقٌ, (S, K, TA, [in some
copies of the K, erroneously, طَفْقٌ,]) of the
former verb; (S, TA;) and طُفُوقٌ, (S, O, K,) of
the latter verb; (S, O;) He set about, began,
commenced, took to, or betook himself to, doing
such a thing: (S, Mgh, O, TA:) expl. in the K
as meaning he continued uninterruptedly the doing
of such a thing (وَاصَلَ الفِعْلَ [or in some copies
وَصَلَ الفِعْلَ]), and by El-Háfidh Ibn-Hajar, in
the “ Fet-h el-Bári,” as meaning he entered upon,
began, or commenced, and went on continually,
doing such a thing; but it denotes the entering
upon the doing of a thing irrespectively of the
going on continually or not, and therefore it is
not allowable to prefix أَنْ to its predicate: (MF,
TA:) it is followed by a future [or an aor., as in
the ex. above]: the saying فَطَفِقَ مَسْحًا بِالسُّوقِ
وَالْأَعْنَاقِ, in the Kur [xxxviii. 32], (TA,) i. e.
He took to severing with the sword [the thighs
and the necks], or, as some say, to wiping [or
stroking] with his hand [the thighs and the necks],
(Bd,) is for طَفِقَ يَمْسَحُ مَسْحًا: (Bd, * TA:) the
verb is used only in an affirmative phrase: they
do not say مَا طَفِقَ. (IDrd, O, K.) ―
-b2-  طَفِقَ فُلَانٌ
بِمَا أَرَادَ, (Aboo-Sa'eed, O, K, *) a phrase of the
Arabs of the desert, (Aboo-Sa'eed, O,) means
Such a one attained that which he desired.
(Aboo-Sa'eed, O, K. *) ―
-b3-  And one says طَفِقَ
المَوْضِعَ, aor.
طَفَقَ, He kept, or clave, to the place.
(ISd, K.)
4
اطفقهُ اللّٰهُ بِهِ God caused him to attain him,
or it. (Aboo-Sa'eed, O, K.) One says, لَئِنْ
أَطْفَقَنِى اللّٰهُ بِهِ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ بِهِ [Verily if God cause me
to attain him, or it, I will assuredly do something with him, or it]. (TA.)
