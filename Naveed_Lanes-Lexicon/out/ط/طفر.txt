طفر1
طَفَرَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb,) aor.
طَفِرَ, (S, Mgh,
Msb,) inf. n. طُفُورٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and طَفْرٌ,
(S, A, Mgh, Msb,) or طَفْرَةٌ, (K,) [but] this has a
more particular signification than طَفْرٌ, (Msb,)
[being an inf. n. un.,] He leaped: (S:) or he
leaped upwards, (Lth, T, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) as
when one leaps over a wall to what is behind it.
(Lth, T, Mgh, Msb.) One says, طَفَرَ الحَائِطَ,
(TA,) or طَفَرَ الحَائِطَ إِلَى مَا وَرَآءَهُ, (A,) He leaped
over the wall to what was behind it. (TA.) And
طَفَرَ الفَرَسُ النَّهْرَ [The horse leaped over the river,
or rivulet]. (A, TA.)
2
طفّر الفَرَسَ النَّهْرَ He made the horse to leap
over the river, or rivulet. (A, TA.)

اِطَّفَرَ فَرَسَهُ, inf. n. اِطِّفَارٌ; (O, TA;) accord.
to the K, أَطْفَرَ, inf. n. إِطْفَارٌ, but the former is the
right; (TA;) He thrust his feet into the groins
of his horse: the doing of which is a fault in the
rider. (O, K, TA.) And in like manner one
says of a man when he makes his camel to run:
(O, TA:) i. e. اِطَّفَرَ بَعِيرَهُ, inf. n. اِطِّفَارٌ, He thrust
his feet into the groins of his camel. (L.) [It
seems to be tropical, from what here follows.] ―
-b2-
اِطَّفَرَ الرَّجُلُ, meaning He stuck his nails [into a
thing] is originally اِظَّفَرَ; (TA; [in which it is
said to be tropical; but for this I see no
reason;]) as also اِطَّفَرَهُ he stuck his nail into it.
(TA in art. ظفر.)
طَفْرَةٌ A leap: (S:) or a leap upwards, (T, A, *
Mgh, Msb, K, *) as when one leaps over a wall;
(T, Mgh, Msb;) said to be thus distinguished
from وَثْبَةٌ, which is downwards. (Mgh, Msb.)
Hence طَفْرَةُ النِّظَامِ [app. meaning An overleaping
the right order, or method: I have not found any
explanation of it]. (A.)
هُوَ طَفَّارُ الأَنْهَارِ [He is the leaper over rivers, or
rivulets]. (A.)
