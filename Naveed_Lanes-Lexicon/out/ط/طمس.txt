You say, طَمَسَتْهُ الرِّيحُ The wind effaced, or

thing. (A.) And it is said in the Kur [lxxvii. 8],
فَإِذَا النُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ And when the stars shall have
their traces extirpated: (O, K:) or shall lose
their light. (T, TA.) ―

-b5-  طَمَسَهُ,
inf. n. طَمْسٌ, also signifies He (God) transformed,
or metamorphosed, him or it. (TA.) Hence the

given to Moses, when the property of Pharaoh
was transformed at his prayer, and became stones.
