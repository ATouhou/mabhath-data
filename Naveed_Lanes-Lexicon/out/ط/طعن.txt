طَعَنَانٌ, [in the CK with the ع quiescent,] but
correctly ↓ طِعِنَّانٌ, with two kesrehs and with a
sheddeh to the ن, which is anomalous; and to
this the K adds طِعَانٌ, with kesr, [in the CK
written with fet-h,] but this is the inf. n. of
↓ طَاعَنُوا, not of تطاعنوا, as also مُطَاعَنَةٌ; (TA;)

-b3-  Golius assigns
also to this word and to طِعْنَةٌ and طُعْنَةٌ, as from
the K, the meaning of A woman of evil disposition: but this is evidently a mistake, and
taken from an art, (next after the present one) in
the K, in which الطَّعْثَنَةُ, there said to be بِالمُهْمَلَةِ
وَالمُثَلَّثَةِ, is expl. as meaning “ the woman evil in
disposition. ”]

mortality in consequence of وَبَأ: (S, Msb:) pl.
طَوَاعِينُ: (S, Msb, K:) it is a tropical term from

رِمَاحُ الجِنِّ [the spears of the jinn, or genii].
(Z, TA.)
مَطْعَنٌ is a noun of place [signifying A place
of piercing or thrusting &c.]; as well as an inf. n.

-b2-  Also (tropical:)  Smitten by
the طَاعُون [i. e. plague, or pestilence]; (Msb,
