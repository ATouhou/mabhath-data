طرش1
طَرِشَ, aor.
طَرَشَ, (Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. طَرَشٌ,
(S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) He was, or became, deaf:
or affected with something less than صَمَمٌ [or deafness]: (Msb:) or like deafness: (Mgh:) [meaning,
heaviness, or dulness, of hearing: (see أَطْرَشُ:)] or
طَرَشٌ is the slightest deafness: (S, A, K: [in the CK
it is erroneously written طَرْش:]) but some say that
it is not pure Arabic: (Msb:) and some say that
it is post-classical: (S, Msb, K:) so says IDrd:
(O:) AHát disallows the root and its derivatives,
and says that they have not been content with the
barbarousness of saying طَرَشٌ, but have formed
from it a verb, namely, طَرِشَ: (O, TA:) ElMa'arree says that the verb has been formed by
the vulgar from أُطْرُوشٌ, which is an Arabic
word. (TA.)
5
تطرّش He stood and sat; said of one who
is convalescent: (O:) or he became convalescent,
and nearly recovered, and arose and walked; syn.
اِبْرَغَشَّ. (K.) ―
-b2-  تطرّش بِالبَهْمِ i. q. اِخْتَلَفَ بِهَا
[i. e. He went to and fro, repeatedly, with the
young lambs or kids: strangely expl. in the TK
as said of a camel, and as meaning he became
mixed, or confounded, among the beasts]. (O, K.)
6
تطارش He feigned himself deaf: (O, K:)
or heavy, or dull, of hearing. (Mgh.)
بِهِ طُرْشَةٌ In him is the slightest deafness. (Ibn-
'Abbád, O, K.)
أَطْرَشُ, (Msb,) or ↓ أُطْرُوشٌ, (Az, A, Mgh, O,
Msb, K,) of which Az says, I know not whether
it be Arabic or adventitious, (Msb,) and IDrd
says that it is not genuine Arabic, (Mgh,) and
AHát disallows it, but El-Ma'arree says that it
is Arabic, though the verb is a barbarism, (TA,)
Deaf; (Msb, K;) and in some of the copies of
[the work of] Yaakoob, ↓ أُطْرُشٌ is found, thus
expl.: (TA:) or heavy, or dull, of hearing:
(Mgh:) or affected with something less than
deafness: (Msb:) or with the slightest deafness:
(A:) the fem. of أَطْرَشُ is طَرْشَآءُ: (Msb:) and
the pl. is طُرْشٌ. (Mgh, O, Msb, K. *)
-A2-  Accord.
to Z, [in the A,] أَطْرَشُ, applied to a man, signifies Having thin eyebrows. (TA. [But I
think that this is a mistranscription for أَطْرَطُ.])
