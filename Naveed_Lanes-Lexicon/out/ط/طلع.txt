inf. n. طُلُوعٌ and مَطْلَعٌ and مَطْلِعٌ, (S, O, Msb,
K,) the second and third both used as inf. ns.,
and also as ns. of place [and of time], (S, O, K,)

saying of Ru-beh,
كَأَنَّهُ كَوْكَبُ غَيْمٍ أَطْلَعَا

آتِيكَ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ طَلَعَتْهُ الشَّمْسُ, meaning طَلَعَتْ فِيهِ
[i. e. I will come to thee every day in which the
sun rises]: and it is said in a prayer, طَلَعَتِ
الشَّمْسُ وَلَا تَطْلُعُ بِنَفْسِ أَحَدٍ مِنَّا [meaning The
sun has risen, and may it not have risen with the

↓ طلّع, (L, K, TA,) inf. n. تَطْلِيعٌ. (L, TA.
[These verbs, in this sense, are app. derived from
the subst. طَلْعٌ; but this is obviously from طَلَعَ.])
―
-b3-  One says also, مَلَأْتُ لَهُ القَدَحَ حَتَّى يَكَادَ يَطْلُعُ
مِنْ نَوَاحِيهِ [I filled for him the drinking-vessel

TA;) the prep. [عَلَى] being suppressed;

عن: accord. to AZ [likewise], طَلَعْتُ عَلَى القَوْمِ,
inf. n. طُلُوعٌ, means I became absent from the
people, or party, so that they did not see me: and
also I advanced, or approached, towards them,
so that they saw me: thus having two contr.
meanings: and accord. to Az, the Arabs said,
طَلَعْتُ فِى الجَبَلِ, inf. n. طُلُوعٌ, as meaning I
retired, or went back, into the mountain, so that
my companion did not see me: [see another
explanation of this phrase in what precedes:]
and طَلَعْتُ عَنْ صَاحِبِى, inf. n. طُلُوعٌ, I retired,
or went back, from my companion: and طَلَعْتُ
عَنْ صَاحِبِى [in which عَنْ seems to be evidently
a mistranscription for عَلَى] I advanced, or approached, towards my companion. (TA.) [In
all of these phrases, طَلَعَ and طَلَعْتُ may be correctly rendered He, and I, came forth, or
went forth. And hence,] it is said in a prov.,

خرم, voce مَخْرِمٌ]. (AZ, TA.) ―

meaning of طَلَعَ followed by عَلَى, see اِطَّلَعَ
[which is more common as having that meaning].
―
-b7-  طَلَعَ is also syn. with قَصَدَ: so in the phrase
طَلَعَ بِلَادَهُ (tropical:)  [He tended, repaired, betook himself,
or went, to, or towards, his country]: (K, TA:)
and so in the saying, in a trad., هٰذَا بُسْرٌ قَدْ طَلَعَ
اليَمَنَ, (so in the O,) or هذا بُرٌّ, (so in the TA,)
(tropical:)  [These are ripening dates, or this is wheat, that
have, or has, gone to, or towards, El-Yemen,]
meaning from Nejd. (TA.) ―

at, their land]; (K, TA;) and مَتَى طَلَعْتَ أَرْضَنَا
(tropical:)  [When didst thou reach, or arrive at, our
land?]: (O, TA:) and so the latter verb in the
saying, هٰذِهِ الأَرْضَ ↓ اطّلع [He reached, or

عَلَى الأَفْئِدَةِ ↓ الَّتِى تَطَّلِعُ, in the Kur [civ. 7],
means (assumed tropical:)  Whereof the pain shall reach the hearts:
(Fr, O, TA:) or which shall rise above the hearts,

but Az disapproves this: (O:) [the verb is correctly explained in what here follows:] one says,

inspected, or considered with my eye, my estate,
and obtained a knowledge of it, or acquainted
myself with its condition]: (TA:) or مُطَالَعَةٌ

[Apparitions of Selmà come to me in the night,
like as the creditor comes in the night to exact the

palm-tree, in the first stage of its appearance, the
covering [or spathe] of which is called the كُفُرَّى
(K, TA) and the كَافُور, (TA,) and what is
within this the إِغْرِيض, because of its whiteness;
(K, TA;) or the طَلْع is what comes forth from
the palm-tree and becomes dates if the tree is
female; and if the tree is male it does not become
dates, but is eaten in its fresh state, or is left upon

thereof [that of] the sperma: and also, [sometimes,] the كِمّ [or spathe] that comes forth from
the palm-tree, before it bursts open longitudinally:
[and this is also called the كُفُرَّى, for] the phrase
طَلْعُ الكُفُزَّى is an instance of the prefixing of a
noun to an explicative thereof: (Mgh:) [or this
phrase may mean the spadix of the spathe of
a palm-tree: طَلْعٌ, it should be added, is sometimes used as a coll. gen. n.: and its n. un. is with
ة: thus in explanations of إِغْرِيضٌ &c.] In the
Kur xxxvii. 63, it is applied to (tropical:)  The fruit, or
