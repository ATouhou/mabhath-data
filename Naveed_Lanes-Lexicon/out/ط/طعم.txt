[app. also he swallowed, for it is said that] it
applies to anything that is swallowed easily or

(S, Mgh, Msb) a thing; (Mgh, Msb;) as also
↓ تطعّم; (S, Mgh, K;) [i. e.] this latter verb
signifies he tasted food in order that he might
know its flavour; and so ↓ استطعم: (Msb:) and

followers, (Bd, Jel,) or is at one, or in union,
with me: (Bd:) or, accord. to Zj, the meaning
is, بِهِ ↓ لَمْ يَتَطَعَّمْ [app. meaning does not refresh
himself with it as though with food]: (TA:) or,
as some say, the passage in which it occurs
denotes a prohibition to take aught save as much
as is laded out with the hand; and when water

it يُطْعَمُ. (Er-Rághib, TA.) تَطْعَمْ ↓ تَطَعَّمْ i. e.

desire, or appetence, (Mgh,) or so that thou
