طنف1
طَنِفَ, aor.
طَنَفَ, (K,) inf. n. طَنَفٌ, (TK,) the
verb of الطَّنَفُ signifying التُّهَمَةُ, (K,) [app., as
such, meaning He was suspicious, agreeably with
the rendering of Golius; or he suspected; as is
indicated by its being said of طَنِفٌ meaning مُتَّهَمٌ,
in the TA, that it is app. a possessive epithet;
for if it were a part. n., طَنِفَ would signify he was
suspected; as it is said to do in the TK and by
Freytag; in my opinion, erroneously, on the
supposition that طَنِفٌ meaning مُتَّهَمٌ is its part. n.]
