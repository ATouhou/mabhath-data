stake: (ISk, S:) pl. طُلْيَانٌ; like رُغْفَانٌ, (ISk,

like a subst. because it is an epithet in which the
quality of a subst. is predominant. (AAF, TA.)

becoming dry upon the teeth from hunger; and
has no pl.: ↓ طَلًا is the inf. n. of طَلِىَ فُوهُ: and
signifies also a whiteness that comes upon the teeth
from disease or thirst; and so ↓ طَلَيَانٌ. (TA.)
[See also طَلِىٌّ.] ―
-b4-  For other meanings of طُلَاوَةٌ,
