طستطَسْتٌ (S, M, K, &c.) A kind of vessel of صُفْر
[or brass]: (M, TA:) [generally pronounced in
the present day طِشْت and طَشْت: and mostly
applied to a kind of basin of tinned copper, or
of brass, or of silver, used for washing the hands
&c., figured and described in my work on the
Modern Egyptians:] i. q. طَسٌّ, [q. v.,] (IKt, S,
Mgh, Msb, K,) which is [said to be] arabicized
from طَسْت, the latter being a foreign word;
(Mgh;) [but it is from the Pers., طَشْت;] it is
of the dial. of Teiyi; (S;) and [said to be]
formed from طَسٌّ, one of the two س being
changed into ت, (IKt, S, Msb, K,) because they
are deemed difficult of pronunciation; (IKt, S,
Msb;) but in forming the pl. and the dim., the
second س is restored, because separated from the
former; (S;) for (IKt, S, Msb) the pl. is طِسَاسٌ
(S, Mgh, Msb) and طُسُوسٌ, though it has also for
its pl. طُسُوتٌ, (IKt, Mgh, Msb,) or, accord. to
Zj, طِسَاتٌ; (Msb;) and the dim. is طُسَيْسٌ, (S,)
or طُسَيْسَةٌ: (IKt, Msb:) it is also pronounced
طِسْتٌ; (MF;) and طَشْتٌ also has been mentioned; (K;) but some say that this is a mistake;
and others, that طَشْت is the original word from
which طَسْتٌ is arabicized: (TA:) Zj says that,
with most of the Arabs, (Msb,) it is fem.: (Mgh,
Msb:) sometimes it is masc.: (Lh, M:) IAmb
says, on the authority of Fr, that the word used
by the Arabs was طَسَّةٌ, save that some said طَسٌّ,
without ة; and that the tribe of Teiyi said طَسْتٌ,
like as they said لِصْتٌ for لِصٌّ: Es-Sijistánee says
that it is a foreign word arabicized: and Az, that
it is a word adopted into the Arabic language,
because ط and ت do not both occur in an
Arabic word. (Msb.)
