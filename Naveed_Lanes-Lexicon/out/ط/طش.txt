طَشٌّ and ↓ طَشِيشٌ Weak [or fine] rain, (S, A,
O, K,) but exceeding what is termed رَذَاذٌ: (S, O,
K:) or the former is less than رَذَاذ: (El-Khattábee,
and Suh in TA art. رذ:) or rain exceeding what
is termed رَِكٌّ, but less than what is termed قِطْقِطٌ:
(TA:) or the first of rain; (L, TA;) next to
which is what is termed رَشٌّ: (L:) [but see these
other terms for rain: طِشَاشٌ and طُشُوشٌ are pls.
of طَشٌّ; both mentioned in the O, though not
there said to be pls. of طَشٌّ:] one says, أَصَابَنَا
طِشَاشٌ وَرِشَاشٌ [Rains such as are termed طشاش
and رشاش fell upon us]. (O.)
طُشَّةٌ and ↓ طُشَاشٌ, both with damm, A malady
like the [rheum termed] زُكَام, (O, K,) incident to
human beings: said by El-Kutabee to be termed طُشَّة
because when he who is affected with it blows his
nose he sprinkles the moisture from it like fine
rain (إِذَا اسْتَنْثَرَ طَشَّ): but the [better] known
word is طُشْأَةٌ (O.) [See also the next paragraph.]
طِشَّة is said in the K to signify A young child;
its author having app. understood a young child
to be meant thereby in a trad. respecting the
[plant called] حَزَاة, in which it is said, يَشْتَرِيهَا
أَكَايِيسُ الصِّبْيَانِ لِلطِّشَّةِ [evidently meaning, Intelligent children purchase it for the malady
termed طِشَّة, this word being doubtless either a
dial. var. of طُشَّة, or a mistranscription]: that
طشّة here denotes children is refuted by another
relation of the trad., يَشْرَبُهَا أَكَايِيسُ النِّسَآءِ لِلطُشَّةِ
[i. e. intelligent women drink a preparation of it
for the طُشَّة]. (TA.)
طَشَاشٌ i. q. رَشَاشٌ [i. e. Such as is sprinkled, or
scattered,] (K, TA) of rain: or such as is weak.

and رِشَاشٌ: see طَشٌّ.] ―

if so, tropical, Weakness of sight: whence the

not blindness]. (TA.)

طَشِيشٌ: see طَشٌّ.
أَرْضٌ مطْشُوشَةٌ Land upon which has fallen rain
such as is termed طَشٌّ. (S, A, O.) ―
-b2-  And رَجُلٌ
مَطْشُوشٌ A man affected with the malady termed
طُشَّة. (TA.)
