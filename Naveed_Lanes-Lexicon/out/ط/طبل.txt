طَبَّلَ see the preceding paragraph.
طَبْلٌ [A drum;] a certain thing with which
one beats, (S, O, K,) [or rather upon which one
beats,] well known, (Msb,) having a single face,
and having two faces: (Msb, K:) pl. [of mult.]
طُبُولٌ (O, Msb, K) and [of pauc.] أَطْبَالٌ. (Msb,
K.) [Hence] one says, هُوَ طَبْلٌ ذُو وَجْهَيْنِ [lit.
He is a double-faced drum]; meaning (tropical:)  he is of
ill-omened, or hard, aspect. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ
يَضْرِبُ الطَّبْلَ تَحْتَ الكِسَآءِ [lit. Such a one beats the
drum beneath the garment called كساء; meaning,
(assumed tropical:)  strives to conceal what is notorious: similar
to the Pers. saying طَبْل دَرْ زِيرِ گِلِيم زَدَنْ]. (TA.)
―
-b2-  Also A رَبْعَة [or small round basket, covered
with leather,] for perfumes. (TA.) And A سَلَّة
[or round basket] for food, [app. shallow, resembling a round tray, for it is said to be] like
the خِوَان; also called ↓ طَبْلِيَّةٌ, of which the pl.
is طَبَالٍ. (TA. [See also سَدٌّ, last sentence.])
[And A kind of tray, of wood, used for counting
money, &c.; also called ↓ طَبْلَةٌ: this is app. what
is meant by the saying in the S, طَبْلُ الدَّرَاهِمِ
وَغَيْرِهَا مَعْرُوفٌ; and by the saying in the O, طَبْلَةُ
الدَّارَهِمِ مَعْرُوفٌ.] ―
-b3-  And A certain sort of garments, or cloths, (Lth, IDrd, O, K, *) upon
which is the form of the طَبْل [or drum], (Lth, O,
K,) or figured with the like of طُبُول [or drums],
(T, TA,) of the fabric of El-Yemen, or of Egypt,
(K,) or brought from Egypt, and called also
↓ الطَّبْلِيَّةُ and أَرْدِيَةُ الطَّبْلِ: (Lth, O:) which last
appellation is expl. in the A as meaning [garments of the kind called] بُرُود, worn by the lords,
or principal personages, of Egypt. (TA.) ―
-b4-
And The [tax called] خَرَاج: (IAar, O, K:)
[or an instalment thereof; for] one says, أَدَّى
أَهْلُ مِصْرَ طَبْلًا مِنَ الخَرَاجِ and طَبْلَيْنِ and طُبُولًا
The people of Egypt payed an instalment of the
خراج [and two instalments and several instalments]; so called after the طَبْل [or drum] of the
بُنْدَار [app. meaning the farmer-general of the tax,
who, it seems from this, announced his coming
by the beating of a drum]: (A, TA:) [and probably syn. with خَرَاجٌ as meaning revenue in a
general sense; for it is added,] hence [the saying]
↓ هُوَ يُحِبُّ الطَّبْلِيَّةَ (O, K [in the CK تَحْتَ is
erroneously put for يُحِبُّ]) i. e. He loves the
خَرَاج, (O,) or the money of the خَرَاج, (K,) without fatigue. (O.)
-A2-  الطَّبْلُ signifies also الخَلْقُ
and النَّاسُ [i. e. The created beings in general and
mankind in particular]: one says, مَا أَدْرِى أَىُّ
الطَّبْلِ هُوَ i. e. [I know not] what one of mankind
he is: (S, O:) and so أَىُّ الطَّبْنِ هُوَ. (TA.)
طَبْلَةٌ [A wooden tray; generally round: like
طَلْبَهٌ in Persian. And such is app. meant by
what here follows:] A certain thing of wood,
which women take for their use. (TA.) See
also طَبْلٌ.
طَبْلِيَّةٌ: see طَبْلٌ, in three places.
طِبَالَةٌ The art, or occupation, of beating the
طبْل [or drum]. (Msb, K.)
طَبَّالٌ [A drummer;] a beater of the طَبْل.
(O, K. *)
طَبَّالَةٌ [fem. of طَبَّالٌ: ―
-b2-  and] i. q. طُوبَالَةٌ, q. v.
طُوبَالَةٌ A ewe; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ طَبَّالَةٌ:
(TA:) pl. of the former طُوبَالَاتٌ: a ram is not
to be called طُوبَالٌ. (S, K.) Tarafeh says,
نَعَانِى حَنَانَةُ طُوبَالَةً
تَسَفُّ يَبِسًا مِنَ العِشْرِقِ
[Hanáneh announced to me death (app. meaning
predicted my death, for otherwise it should be
نَعَى لِى): a ewe that eats dry 'ishrik]: (S, O,
TA:) [in explanation of which it is said,] نَعَانِى
means أَخْبَرَنِى بِالمَوْتِ: and حَنَانَة is the name of
a pastor: and طوبالة is put in the accus. case as
a term of revilement, as though the poet said
أَعْنِى طُوبَالَةً. (TA.)
