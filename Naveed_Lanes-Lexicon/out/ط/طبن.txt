طَبْنٌ A numerous collection or body (K, TA) of
men; (TA;) as also ↓ طَبَنٌ. (K, TA. [Freytag
adds طِبْنٌ and طُبْنٌ in this sense; but they are

certain game: and Golius adds, instead of these
two, طِبِنٌ and طُبُنٌ, which are altogether
wrong.]) ―

called by them الرَّحَى; (TA;) called in Pers.
سِهْ بَرَهٌ, or سِيدَرَهِ, (accord. to different copies of
the S,) or سِدْرَه, (accord. to some copies of the K,
and the TA, [this and سِيدَرَه being app. for سِهٌ
دَرَهٌ, which is syn. with سِهْ بَرَهْ,] in a MS. copy of
the K سَذْ مَرَهْ, and in the CK سِدْ مَزْه, [both
app. mistranscriptions for سِهْ بَرَهْ,]) i. e. “ having
three doors; ” (TA;) [app. the same that is sometimes called in Pers. سِهْ دَرَكْ;] the game that is
called in Turkish طوقورجون [and طُوقُرْجِنْ],
and in Arabic called also قرق; (TK;) [i. e. قِرْقٌ,
which is said in the K and TA in art. قرق to be
the game called سُدَّر; accord. to an explanation
and diagram there given, played by means of
twenty-four lines, composed of four squares, or
parallelograms, one of these having within it
another, the latter having within it another, and
this last having within it another; to which are
added a line drawn from each angle of the outermost of these to the corresponding angle of the
innermost and another line drawn from the
middle of each side of the outermost to the middle
of the corresponding side of the innermost; within
which combination of twenty-four lines they place
(يَضَعُونَ, in the CK يَصُفُّونَ,) pebbles. سُدَّر is
evidently from the Pers. سِهْ دَرَهْ: it is said in the
TA in art. سدر to be also pronounced سِدَّر and
سَدَّر, and to be a Pers. term arabicized. Golius,
without mentioning any other authority than that
of the K, explains طُبَنٌ as follows: “ Pers.
سَدَرَهْ, Turc. دُقُرْجُنْ اُويُنِى, Græc.
τριώδιον, Trium,
vel novem, scruporum ludus. ” Freytag explains
the same word as meaning “ Triodii seu trivalli
ludus; ” adding a loose rendering of the explanation of قِرْق in the K.]
-A2-  طُبْنَةٌ signifies also The
sound of the [musical instrument called] طُبْن.
