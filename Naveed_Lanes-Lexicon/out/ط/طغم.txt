1
طَغَى, aor. يَطْغَى; (S, M, Msb, TA, &c.;)

extravagant in acts of disobedience and in wrongdoing: (K:) accord. to El-Harállee, الطُّغْيَانُ
signifies the acting wrongfully in respect of the
limits of things and the measures thereof. (TA.)
―
-b2-  [Hence,] طَغَى, in the K طَغِىَ, but the former
is the right, (TA,) or طَغَا, (Msb,) said of a
torrent, (Msb,) or of water, (K, TA,) (tropical:)  It rose
high, (Msb, K, TA,) so as to exceed the ordinary
limit in copiousness: (Msb:) or طَغَى or طَغَا,
(accord. to different copies of the S,) said of a
torrent, (assumed tropical:)  it brought much water: and, said of
the sea, (assumed tropical:)  its waves became raised, or in a state
of commotion: and, said of the blood, (assumed tropical:)  it became
roused, or excited. (S.) [Hence also the phrase
طَغَا مِرْقَمُكَ (assumed tropical:)  Thy pen has exceeded its due limit:
see art. رقم.] ―

6
تطاغى المَوْجُ [app. The waves conflicted, or
dashed together, with excessive vehemence]: a
phrase mentioned by Z. (TA.)
طَغًا: see what next follows.
طَغْىٌ; accord. to the copies of the K ↓ طَغًا,
but this is incorrect; A sound, or voice; of the
dial. of Hudheyl: one says, سَمِعْتُ طَغْىَ فُلَانٍ I
heard the sound, or voice, of such a one: and, as
in the “ Nawádir,” سَمِعْتُ طَغْىَ القَوْمِ, and طَهْيَهُمْ,
and دَغْيَهُمْ, I heard the sound, or voice, [or voices,]
of the people, or party. (TA.)
طَغْوَةٌ: see what next follows.
طَغْيَةٌ The top, or upper part, of a mountain:
(S, TA:) and any high, or elevated, place; as
also ↓ طَغْوَةٌ. (TA as from the S: but only the
latter word is mentioned in this sense in my
copies of the S.) ―
-b2-  And (S) A small quantity
(نُبْذَةٌ) of anything: (S, K: *) so says AZ. (S.
[In this sense, and in the two senses following,
erroneously written in the CK طَغِيَّة.]) ―
-b3-  And
A smooth stone or rock. (K.) ―
-b4-  And, accord.
to the copies of the K, الطَّغْيَةُ signifies المُسْتَصْعَبُ
مِنَ الجَبَلِ [as though meaning What is deemed,
or found, difficult, of the mountain]: but [SM
says, though I think this doubtful,] it is correctly
مِنَ الخَيْلِ [meaning what is refractory, or untractable, of horses], as in the M. (TA.)
طَغْوَى a subst. from the verb طَغَا, (K, TA,)
[and] so is ↓ طُغْيَانٌ, (Msb,) or the latter is an
inf. n., (S, K,) and, accord. to Az, so is طَغْوَى,
and so too is ↓ طَغْيَا, which latter is said by Zj to
be the original of طَغْوَى: (TA:) it is like طُغْوَانٌ
and طُغْيَانٌ. (S.) Hence, in the Kur [xci. 11],
كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ بِطَغْوَاهَا [Thamood disbelieved by
reason of their exorbitance]; (K, * TA;) meaning
that they did not believe when they were
threatened with the punishment of their طُغْيَان:
or, as is said in the Expos. of Bkh, the meaning
is, by reason of their acts of disobedience. (TA.)
طَغْيَا: see the next preceding paragraph.
-A2-  It
is also a proper name for [The bovine antelope
called] بَقَرَةُ الوَحْشِ; (K, TA;) from طَغَتِ البَقَرَةُ
[expl. above: see 1, last sentence]: (TA:) [or,
as it appears from a citation in the TA, partly
mistranscribed so as to be unintelligible, طَغْيَا or
↓ طُغْيَا signifies, accord. to IAar, a بَقَرَة uttering a
cry or cries, or a loud cry or loud cries:] or
↓ طُغْيَا with damm accord. to As, or طَغْيَا with
fet-h accord. to Th, signifies a youngling of the
بَقَر الوَحْش. (S.)
طُغْيَا: see what next precedes, in two places.
طُغْيَانٌ: see طَغْوَى.
طَاغٍ Any exceeding his, or its, just limit [in an
absolute sense or] in disobedience. (S, Msb.)
طَاغِيَةٌ i. q. جَبَّارٌ [i. e. Insolent, tyrannical, &c.];
(K, TA;) who deviates from the right way or
course, or trangresses the just limit: (TA:) and
stupid, or foolish; proud; (K, TA;) wrongful,
unjust, or injurious, in conduct: (TA:) or one who
cares not what he does, devouring [the property
of] men, and oppressing them, and who is not
turned from his course by a disposition to shun sin
or crime, nor by fear. (Sh, TA.) [Hence,]
الطَّاغِيَةُ is an appellation of The king of the رُوم [or
Greeks of the Lower Empire]; (S, K, TA;)
applied to him as a surname because of his much
exorbitance, and corrupt conduct. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
A thunderbolt; syn. صَاعِقَةٌ. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  And
The cry of punishment; by which Thamood were
destroyed, as mentioned in the Kur [lxix. 5]:
(S, TA:) or, accord. to Zj, it there means their
طُغْيَان [or exorbitance]; being a subst. like عَافِيَةٌ
and عَاقِبَةٌ. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Also The flood denoted by
the words of the Kur [lxix. 11] إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَى المَآءُ.
(Er-Rághib, TA.)
طَاغُوتٌ is of the measure فَلَعُوتٌ, from طَغَوْتُ;
(M, K;) formed by transposition, though like
لَاهُوتٌ which is not so formed: (S:) it is originally of the measure فَعَلُوتٌ, which is changed to
فَلَعُوتٌ, so that it becomes طَوَغُوتٌ, and this is
then altered to طَاغُوتٌ: (Msb, TA:) it is held to
be altered from طَوَغُوت rather than from طَغَيُوت
because the transposition of و is more common
than that of ى, as in شَاكٍ &c.: (M, TA:) or, as
some say, the ت is a substitute for و, and the
measure is فَاعُولٌ: and some say that the measure
is فَاعَلُوتٌ, and that it is originally طَاغَيُوتٌ:
(TA:) the pl. is طَوَاغِيتُ (S, K) and طَوَاغٍ, (K,)
the latter mentioned by ISd. (TA.) It signifies
A devil; (S, Msb, K, TA;) thus expl. by Abu-l-
'Áliyeh and others, and said to be on the
authority of 'Omar: (TA:) or one that is exorbitant in pride or corruptness or disbelief or disobedience, of the jinn, or genii: (Er-Rághib,
TA:) or الطَّاغُوتُ means [the idol called] اللَّات
and [that called] العُزَّى; (K;) or thus some
expl. الجِبْت and الطَّاغُوت [together, in the Kur
iv. 54]: (TA:) or whatever is worshipped instead, or to the exclusion, of God; (Zj, K, TA;)
as also الجِبْتُ: (Zj, TA:) and the idols [in
general]: (K:) or it is of the idols, and of the
jinn, or genii, and of mankind: (Akh, TA:) or
he who turns from the good way: (Er-Rághib,
TA:) and the diviner: (S, K, TA:) and the
enchanter: thus expl. by 'Ikrimeh; and said to
mean thus in the Kur iv. 63: and so الجِبْتُ
accord. to Zj: (TA:) and any head, or leader,
of error: (S, K:) and the exorbitant in pride or
corruptness or disbelief or disobedience, of the
people of the Scripture: (K:) it is used as a
sing., (S, K,) as in the Kur iv. 63; (S;) and as
a pl., (S, K,) as in the Kur ii. 259; (S;) and
masc. and fem., (Msb, TA,) as fem. in the Kur
xxxix. 19: (TA:) or by الجِبْت is meant Hoyeí
Ibn-Akhtab; and by الطَّاغُوت, Kaab Ibn-ElAshraf: (I'Ab, K:) and [the pls.] طَوَاغِيتُ and
طَوَاغٍ signify [sometimes] idol temples: so says
El-Háfidh in the preface to the “ Fet-h ” [i. e.
his celebrated work entitled “ Fet-h el-Bári ”].
