from the extent of thy vision: or, as some say,
in the space in which thou shalt open thine eye
and then close it: or in the space in which one

a garment or some other thing, (TA,) so that it
shed tears: and one says of the eye, طُرِفَتْ. (S,

مَسَامِعَكُمُ الشَّهَوَاتُ [The good of the present world
hath smitten your eyes, and appetences have

إِنَّكَ وَاللّٰهِ لَذُو مَلَّةٍ
يَطْرِفُكَ الأَدْنَى عَنِ الأَبْعَدِ
so in the S; but the right reading is عَنِ الأَقْدَمِ,
for the next verse ends with تَصْرِمِى: (IB, TA:)
[i. e. Verily thou, by Alláh, art one having a
weariness: the nearer turns thee away, or back,
from the older:] meaning, he turns away, or
back, thy sight from the latter: i. e. thou takest
the new (الجَدِيدَ ↓ تَسْتَطْرِفُ), and forgettest the
old. (S, TA.) You say, طَرَفْتُ البَصَرَ عَنْهُ (S *
Msb) I turned away, or back, the sight from him,
or it. (Msb.) And اِطْرِفٌ بَصَرَكَ Turn away, or

طَرْفٌ The eye; a word having no pl. in this
sense because it is originally an inf. n., (S, O, K,)
therefore it may denote a sing. and may also
denote a pl. number [i. e. may signify also eyes]:
(S, O, Msb:) or, (K,) as Ibn-'Abbád says,
(O,) it is a coll. n. signifying the بَصَر [which
has the sing. and the pl. meanings mentioned
above, as well as the meaning of the sense of
sight], and is not dualized nor pluralized: or, as
some say, it has for pl. أَطْرَافٌ: (O, K:) but this
is refuted by the occurrence of طَرْف in a pl. sense
in the Kur xxxvii. 47 and xxxviii. 52 and lv. 56:
(O:) and though الأَطْرَاف is said to occur as its
pl. in a trad. of Umm-Selemeh, this is a mistake
for الإِطْرَاق: (Z, O:) it is said, however, that its
being originally an inf. n. is not a reason for its
not being allowable to pluralize it when it has
become a subst., and especially when it is not
meant to convey the signification of an epithet:
(MF:) [but it may be regarded as an epithet;
meaning seer, and, being originally an inf. n.,
seers also; and this is the more probable because]
↓ الطَّوَارِفُ [is an epithet used as a subst., and
thus] signifies the eyes, (S, O, K,) as in the
saying هُوَ بِمَكَانٍ لَا تَرَاهُ الطَّوَارِفُ [He is in a place
in which the eyes will not see him]; (S, * O, * TA;)
pl. of ↓ طَارِفَةٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] الطَّرْفُ is the
name of (assumed tropical:)  Two stars, which precede الجَبْهَةُ, (S, O,
K,) so called because (K) they are [regarded as]
the two eyes of Leo; one of the Mansions of the

the طَرْف of Leo, consisting of two small stars in
front of الجَبْهَة, like the فَرْقَدَانِ, but inferior to
them in light, and having somewhat of obliquity;
the Ninth Mansion of the Moon: (Kzw in his
descr. of that Mansion:) or the star [app. lambda] in
the face of Leo, together with that which is outside [app. alpha] on the figure of Cancer: (Kzw in
his descr. of Leo:) or the bright star [alpha] on the
hinder, southern, leg, or foot, [i. e. claw,] of
Cancer. (Kzw in his descr. of Cancer.) [See

first sentence.
طُرْفٌ: see طَرِيفٌ, with which it is syn., and
of which it is also a pl.
طِرْفٌ A generous horse: (As, S, O, K:) or,
accord. to Er-Rághib, one that is looked at
(يُطْرَفُ) because of his beauty; so that it is
originally مَطْرُوفٌ, i. e. مَنْظُورٌ; like نِقْضٌ in the
sense of مَنْقُوضٌ: (TA:) pl. طُرُوفٌ (As, S, O, K)
and أَطْرَافٌ: (O, K:) accord. to AZ, an epithet applied peculiarly to the males: (S, O, K: *)
or generous in respect of the sires and the dams:
(Lth, O, K:) or recently acquired; not of his
owner's breeding; fem. with ة, (O, K,) occurring
in a verse of El-'Ajjáj: Lth says that they sometimes apply the epithets طِرْفٌ and طِرْفَةٌ as syn.
with نَجِيبٌ and نَجِيبَةٌ, in a manner unusual in
the language: (O:) accord. to Ks, طِرْفَةٌ is applied
as an epithet to a mare: (TA:) and طِرْفٌ signifies also a horse long in the legs or the neck,
having the ears pointed, tapering, or slender at
the extremities. (TA in the supplement to this
art.) ―
-b2-  And (tropical:)  Generous (S, O, TA) as an epithet
applied to a young man (S, TA) or to a man;

generous in respect of his male and his female ancestors: (K, * TA:) pl. أَطْرَافٌ: (O, K:) when
applied to other than man, its pl. [or rather one
of its pls.] is طُرُوفٌ. (K.) ―
-b3-  See also طَرَفٌ,
latter half. ―
-b4-  And رَجُلٌ طِرْفٌ فِى نَسَبِهِ, (K, TA,)
with kesr, (TA,) [in the CK, erroneously, طَرْفٌ,]
(assumed tropical:)  A man whose nobility is recent: as though a
contraction of ↓ طَرِفٌ. (K, TA.) ―
-b5-  And اِمْرَأَةٌ
طِرْفُ الحَدِيثِ, (K, TA,) with kesr, (TA,) [in the
CK طَرْف,] A woman whose discourse is good;
every one who has heard it esteeming it new
(يَسْتَطْرِفُهُ). (K, * TA.)

-b2-  See
also طَرِفٌ, in two places. ―
-b3-  And see طَرِيفٌ.
-A3-
Also Anything of the produce of the earth still in
the calyxes thereof. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K, *)
طَرَفٌ The extremity, or end, of anything; [as
of a sword, and of a spear, and of a rope, and of
the tongue, &c.;] thus accord. to ISd; but in
the K this meaning is assigned to ↓ طَرْفٌ: (TA:
[several evidences of the correctness of the former
word in this sense will be found in the present
art.; and countless instances of it occur in other
arts. &c.: it seems to have been generally regarded by the lexicographers as too notorious to
need its being mentioned:]) and a side; a lateral,
or an outward, or adjacent, part or portion; a
region, district, quarter, or tract; syn. نَاحِيَةٌ:
(S, O, Msb, K:) and a part, portion, piece, or
bit, (syn. طَائِفَةٌ,) of a thing: (S, O, K:) it is
used in relation to bodies, or material things, and
to times &c.; (Er-Rághib, TA;) and is thus
used in the sense of طَائِفَة of a people, in the Kur
iii. 122; (Ksh;) [and may often be rendered
somewhat of a thing, whether material (as land
&c.) or not material (as in the T and S voce ذَرْوٌ,
where it is used of a saying, and as in the S and
A and K in art. هوس &c., where it is used of
madness, or insanity, or diabolical possession):]
the pl. is أَطْرَافٌ. (O, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
الأَطْرَافُ signifies The fingers: and [when relating
to the fingers] has no sing. unless this is used as
a prefixed noun, as in the saying أَشَارَتْ بِطَرَفِ
إِصْبَعِهَا [She made a sign with the end of her
finger]: but the pl. is said by Az to be used in
the sense of the sing. in the following ex. cited
by Fr,
يُبْدِينَ أَطْرَافًا لِطَافًا عَنَيَهٌ
[so that the meaning is, They show an elegant
finger like a fruit of the species of tree called
عَنَم]; therefore the poet says عَمَنَه [which is a
n. un.: but I think that it is much more reasonable, and especially as the verb is pl., to regard
the ه in this case as the ه of pausation, of which
see an ex. voce حِينٌ; and accordingly to render
the saying, they show elegant fingers like fruits of
the عَنَم]. (TA.) It is said in a trad. of
Abraham, when he was a little child, جُعِلَ رِزْقُهُ
فِى أَطْرَافِهِ [His sustenance was made to be in his
fingers]; meaning that he used to suck his fingers
and find in them that which nourished him.

their length; and the bunch of which is about a
cubit long. (TA.) ―

of A sort of serpent, (K,) a sort of black serpent,
(TA,) or the [serpent called] أَسْوَد, (O,) having
two stings, one in its nose and the other in its tail,

smites to linger, killing at once. (O, K, TA.) ―

طَرَفَا الدَّابَّةِ sometimes means The fore part and

as in the L, أَطْرَافٌ is pl. of طَرَفٌ as syn. with
شَوَاةٌ [n. un. of شَوًى, q. v.]. (TA.) ―
-b7-  [And the
dual has various other meanings assigned to it,
derived from the first of the significations mentioned in this paragraph.] It is said in a trad.
(O, K) of the Prophet, (O,) كَانَ إِذَا اشْتَكَى أَحَدٌ
مِنْ أَهْلِهِ لَمْ تَزَلِ البُرْمَةُ عَلَى النَّارِ حَتَّى يَأْتِىَ عَلَى
أَحَدِ طَرَفَيْهِ [It was the case that when any one of
his family had a complaint, the cooking-pot did
not cease to be on the fire but he arrived at one of
his two limits]; meaning (assumed tropical:)  convalescence or death;
because these are the two terminations of the case
of the diseased. (O, K.) ―
-b8-  And one says, لَا
يَمْلِكُ طَرَفَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  He will not have control over his
mouth and his anus: referring to him who has
drunk medicine or become intoxicated. (AO,
ISk, S, O, K.) ―
-b9-  And فُلَانٌ فَاسِدُ الطَّرَفِيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  Such
a one is corrupt in respect of the tongue and the
فَرْج. (TA.) ―
-b10-  And لَا يَدْرِى أَىُّ طَرَفَيْهِ أَطْوَلُ,
(in the CK يُدْرَى,) [He will not, or does not,
know which of his two extremities is the longer,]
meaning (tropical:)  his ذَكَر and his tongue; (S, O, K,
TA;) whence طَرَفٌ is used as signifying (assumed tropical:)  the
tongue: (TA:) or the meaning is, as some say,
(assumed tropical:)  which of his two halves is the longer; the lower
or the upper: (TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  the lineage of his
father or that of his mother (O, K, TA) in respect
of generosity, or nobility: (O, TA:) i. e., which
of his two parents is the more generous, or noble:
so says Fr. (TA.) ―
-b11-  كَرِيمُ الطَّرَفَيْنِ means
(tropical:)  Generous, or noble, [on both sides, i. e.] in respect
of male and female ancestors. (S, O, TA.) ―
-b12-
And أَطْرَافٌ means also (assumed tropical:)  A man's father and
mother and brothers and paternal uncles and any
relations whom it is unlawful for him to marry.
(AZ, S, O, K.) ―
-b13-  And (assumed tropical:)  Noble, or exalted, men:
(Th, S:) or أَطْرَافُ الأَرْضِ means (tropical:)  the noble, or
exalted, men, and the learned men, of the earth,
or land: (O, K, TA:) one of whom is termed
طَرَفٌ, or ↓ طِرْفٌ. (O, See the latter of these
words.) And hence, as some explain it, the saying
in the Kur [xiii. 41, like one in xxi. 45], أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا
أَنَّا نَأْتِى الْأَرْضَ نَنْقُصُهَا مِنْ أَطْرَافِهَا (assumed tropical:)  [Have they not
seen that we visit, or bring destruction upon, the
land, curtailing it of its learned men?]; the
meaning being, the death of its learned men:
(O, TA:) or, as some say, [curtailing it of its
inhabitants and its fruits; for they say that] the
meaning is, the death of its inhabitants and the
diminution of its fruits: (TA:) or it means,
curtailing it of its sides, or districts, one by one:
(Az, O, L:) Ibn-'Arafeh says that the meaning
is, we lay open by conquest, to the Prophet,
(نَفْتَحُ عَلَى النَّبِىِّ,) the country around Mekkeh.
(O, TA.) [―
-b14-  أَطْرَافُ النَّاسِ also means (assumed tropical:)  The
lower orders of the people: but this I believe to
be post-classical.] ―
-b15-  طَرَفَىِ النَّهَارِ, in the Kur
xi. 116, means غُدْوَةً وَعَشِيَّةً [i. e. Morning and
afternoon]; by the former being meant daybreak; and by the latter, noon and the عَصْر
[q. v.], (Ksh, Bd,) or the عَصْر [only]. (Bd.)
And أَطْرَافَ النَّهَارِ, in the Kur xx. 130, means At
daybreak and at sunset: (Ksh, Bd:) or at noon
and at the عَصْر; so says Zj: or, accord. to IAar,
in the hours (سَاعَات) of the day: Abu-l-'Abbás
says that it means طَرَفَىِ النَّهَارِ. (TA.) ―
-b16-  [عَلَى
طَرَفٍ often occurs as meaning Beside, aside, or
apart; like على جَانِبٍ, and على نَاحِيَةٍ: and in
like manner the Persians say بَرْ طَرَفْ. ―
-b17-  And
مِنْ طَرَفِ فُلَانٍ is often used as meaning On the
part of such a one; but is perhaps post-classical.]
―
-b18-  And you say, لِلْأَمْرِ طَرَفَانِ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  There
are two ways of performing the affair, either of
which may be chosen; as though it had two ends,
or two sides]. (TA voce صَرْعٌ.) And جَعَلَهُ
مُطْلَقَ الطَّرَفَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  [He made it allowable, or free,
in respect of both the alternatives, either way one
might choose to take]. (Msb in art. بوح.) ―
-b19-
[And hence, perhaps,] طَرَفٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  Anything chosen or choice: pl. أَطْرَافٌ: [whence]
أَطْرَافُ الحَدِيثِ means (assumed tropical:)  Chosen, or choice,
subjects of discourse; as also الحَدِيثِ ↓ طَرَائِفُ:
and أَطْرَافُ الأَحَادِيثِ means [the same, or] colloquies of friends, consisting of mutual communications, and oblique expressions, and allusions: so
says ISd: and this is likewise a meaning of
↓ الطِّرَافُ and السِّبَابُ, which latter [properly
signifying “ mutual reviling ”] is given in the K
as an explanation of the former. (TA.) ―
-b20-  Also
Flesh, or flesh-meat; syn. لَحْمٌ. (TA.)
طَرِفٌ, in the K ↓ طِرْف, but the former is the
right, (TA,) A male camel that removes from one
pasturage to another; (K, TA;) not keeping
constantly to one pasturage. (TA.) And طَرِفَةٌ A
she-camel that does not keep constantly to one
pasturage; (S, O, K;) that depastures the extremities, or sides, of the pasturage, and tastes,
and does not keep constantly to one pasturage:
(Har p. 569:) or, accord. to As, that looks at the
meadows (تَطْرِفُ الرِّيَاضَ), meadow after meadow
[app. to pasture upon them in succession]: (TA:)
and ↓ مُسْتَطْرِفَةٌ, so applied, signifies the same as
طَرِفَةٌ: (TA, but not as on the authority of As:)
and ↓ مِطْرَافٌ, so applied, that will not feed upon
a pasturage unless she choose anew, or take the
first of, (حَتَّى تَسْتَطْرِفَ,) another. (As, S, O, K.)
―
-b2-  And [hence (see 10)] طَرِفٌ applied to a man
signifies (assumed tropical:)  That does not keep constantly to a
wife, or woman, nor to a companion: (S, O, K:)
and ↓ طِرْف, thus accord. to the K, (TA, [in
which it is said that by rule it should be طَرِفٌ, as
above,]) a man who does not keep constantly to
the companionship of one person, by reason of his
weariness. (K.) And ↓ مُتَطَرِّفَةٌ applied to a
woman (assumed tropical:)  That chooses new ones of the men
(تَسْتَطْرِفُ الرِّجَالَ), not keeping constantly to a
husband; as being likened to the she-camel
termed طَرِفَةٌ. (Har p. 569.)
-A2-  And طَرِفٌ,
applied to a she-camel, (O, K, [but in some of
the copies of the latter, where it follows next
after another explanation of the epithet thus
applied, mentioned above, “or,”]) accord. to
IAar, Whose fore part of the head has gradually
shed its hair (الَّتِى تَحَاتَّ مُقَدَّمُ الرَّأْسِ فِيهَا, O) or
whose fore part of her mouth has shed its teeth
one after another (التى تَحَاتَّ مُقَدَّمُ فِيهَا, K) by
reason of extreme age. (O, K. [See 2, last
sentence.])
-A3-  Also, and ↓ طَريفٌ (assumed tropical:)  Contr. of قُعْدُدٌ;
(S, M, K, TA;) i. e., as the latter is further expl.
in the S, and each in the M, having many
ancestors, up to the greatest [i. e. most remote]
forefather; and J adds that sometimes it is used
in praise: thus also As explains النَّسَبِ ↓ طَرِيفُ:
accord. to IAar, طَرِيفٌ signifies منحدر فى
النَّسَبِ [app. مُنْحَدِرٌ, as though meaning of long
descent]; and he says that it is with the Arabs
more noble than قُعْدُدٌ: the pl. of طَرِفٌ as meaning the contr. of قُعْدُدٌ is طَرِفُونَ; and the pl. of
↓ طَرِيفٌ in the same sense is طُرُفٌ and طُرَفٌ and
طُرَّافٌ, the second and third of which pls. are
anomalous. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [طَرِفٌ seems also to have
the contr. meaning; or (assumed tropical:)  One whose nobility is
recent: and the like is said of قُعْدُدٌ; that it has
two contr. meanings:] see طِرْفٌ.
طَرْفَةٌ [A wink, i. e.] a closing of one of the
eyelids upon the other: (S, O, K:) or [a twinkling
of the eye, i. e.] a putting the eyelids in motion or
in a state of commotion. (K.) One says أَسْرَعُ
مِنْ طَرْفَةِ عَيْنٍ [Quicker than a wink, or a twinkling of an eye]. (S, O.) And مَا يُفَارِقُنِى طَرْفَةَ
عَيْنٍ [He does not separate himself from me
during a wink, or a twinkling of an eye]. (TA.)
―
-b2-  Also A red spot of blood, in the eye, occasioned
by a blow or some other cause. (S, O, K.) ―
-b3-
And A brand, or mark made with a hot iron,
having to it no أَطْرَاف [or sides, or lateral portions], being only a line. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.)
-A2-  And الطَّرْفَةُ A certain star or asterism (نَجْمٌ).
(K. [There thus mentioned as though different
from the asterism commonly called الطَّرْفُ, which
I do not believe to be the case: see the latter
appellation.])
طُرْفَةٌ A hurt of the eye, occasioning its shedding
tears. (K.)
-A2-  And Newly-acquired property;
(S, O, K;) anything that one has newly acquired,
and that pleases him; as also ↓ أُطْرُوفَةٌ; (TA;)
a thing newly acquired; (Har p. 54;) and a
thing that is strange and deemed good; (Id. p.
615;) [a pleasing rarity;] a welcome, or pleasing,
thing; (KL;) and a gift not given to any one
before; (K, * TA;) and a gift of which the
recipient did not possess the like, and which pleases
him; (TA;) [generally, a novel, or rare, and
pleasing, present; like تُرْفَةٌ and تُحْفَةٌ:] pl. طُرَفٌ.
(Har p. 32.) [See also طَرِيفٌ and طَرِيفَةٌ.]
طَرَفَةٌ A single tree of the species called طَرْفَآء,
q. v. (AHn, S, O, K.)
طُرْفَى Remoteness in lineage from the [chief, or
oldest,] ancestor: قُعْدَى is nearer therein. (IB,
TA.) [See طَرِفٌ.]
طَرْفَآء [accord. to some طَرْفَآءٌ and accord. to
others طَرْفَآءُ, as will be seen from what follows,]
A kind of trees, (S, O, K,) of which there are
four species, one of these being the أَثْل [q. v.]:
(K:) [or it is different from the أَثْل: the name
is now generally applied to the common, or
French, tamarisk; tamarix gallica of Linn.:
(Forskål's Flora Aegypt. Arab. p. lxiv. no. 181;
and Delile's Floræ Aegypt. Illustr. no. 349:)]
AHn says, it is of the kind called عِضَاه; its هَدَب
[q. v.] are like those of the أَثْل; it has no wood
fit for carpentry, coming forth only as even and
smooth rods towards the sky; and sometimes the
camels eat it as حَمْض [q. v.] when they find no
other حَمْض: AA, he adds, says that it is a sort
of حَمْض: (TA:) the n. un. is ↓ طَرَفَةٌ, (AHn,
S, O, K,) [which is irreg.,] and طَرْفَآءَةٌ, (AHn,
O, K, [in the CK, erroneously, طَرْفَاةٌ,]) [and this
requires طَرْفَآء to be with tenween, as a coll.
gen. n.,] or, accord. to Sb, طَرْفَآء is sing. and pl.:
(S, O:) or it is a pl. [or quasi-pl. n.] of طَرَفَةٌ,
like as شَجْرَآءُ is of شَجَرَةٌ: (S in art. شجر: [see
شَجَرٌ:]) or it is coll. gen. n.: accord. to IJ,
the ء in طَرْفَآء is a denotative of the fem. gender;
but in طَرْفَآءَةٌ, the ة is a denotative of the fem.
gender, and the ء is augmentative. (M, TA.)
―
-b2-  Also A place of growth of the طَرَفَة. (TA.)
طِرَافٌ The portion that is taken [app. meaning

(S, O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ طِرْفٌ and ↓ طُرْفٌ and
↓ مُطْرِفٌ (K) and ↓ مُسْتَطْرَفٌ; (TA;) [and it is said
in one place in the TA that ↓ مِطْرَفٌ and ↓ مَطْرَفٌ
are dial. vars. of مُطْرِفٌ; but I think that this
last word is probably a mistake for ↓ مُطْرَفٌ;]
contr. of تَلِيدٌ (S, O, Msb) and تَالِدٌ (S, O) [and
تِلَادٌ]: pl. of the first and third طُرْفٌ. (K.) ―
-b2-
Also, the first, A thing that is good [and recent
or new or fresh]: (Msb:) what is strange, (IAar,
K, TA,) [or rare,] and coloured, or of various
colours, (IAar, TA,) [or pleasing to the eye,]
of fruits and other things, (IAar, K, TA,) مِمَّا
يستطرف بِهِ [in which يستطرف is evidently a mistranscription for يُطْرَفُ, i. e., of such things as are
given as طُرَف (pl. of طُرْفَة) meaning rare and
pleasing gifts]. (TA, from IAar.) ―

عَلَى رِسْلِهَا مَطْرُوفَةً لَمْ تَشَدَّد

she betakes herself to us in her gentle way, as
though her eye were hurt by something, by reason
of the languish of her look, not straining herself
in her singing; but as some relate the verse, the
word is مَطْرُوقَةً, meaning “ weakly: ” (EM:)
or it means whose eye the love of men has smitten,
so that she raises her eyes and looks at every one
that looks at her; as though a طَرْفَة [or red spot
of blood], or a stick or the like, hurt her eye:
(Az, TA:) or having a languishing eye; as though
it were turned away, or back, (طُرِفَتٌ,) from

the men (تَطْرِفُ الرِّجَالَ); i. e. (assumed tropical:)  who does not keep
constantly to one; the pass. part. n. being put in

of the word: (TA:) or مَطْرُوفَةٌ بِالرِّجَال means
(tropical:)  a woman who raises, or stretches and raises, her
eye at men, (S, O, K, TA,) and turns away her
look from her husband, to others, (S, TA, *) and
in whom is no good: (TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  who looks not at
any but the men; (K;) or مَطْرُوفَةُ العَيْنِ بِالرِّجَالِ
