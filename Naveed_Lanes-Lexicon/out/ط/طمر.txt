written upon: (Har ibid.:) [a مِسَرَّة (an instrument in which one speaks secretly) is described
in the S and K as being like a طُومَار: and this
word is particularly applied, but perhaps as a
post-classical term, to a roll of papyrus, or to

used in this sense: (see De Sacy's “ Rel. de
l'Égypte par Abd-Allatif,” p. 109, where ElKindee is cited to this effect:) see also سِجِلٌّ:]
طُومَارٌ is said to be a foreign word introduced into
the Arabic language; but ISd thinks it to be
genuine Arabic, because Sb reckons it among the
words that are Arabic in form, and asserts it to
be quasi-coordinate to فُسْطَاطٌ: (TA:) the pl. is
طَوَامِيرُ. (S, A, K, &c.) [قَلَمُ طُومَارٍ is a modern
term for A sort of large handwriting.]

↓ the مِطْمَار in the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz
is the شَاقُول, (O,) which is a wooden implement,

then he sticks it in the ground, and keeps it in its
place firmly by stretching the rope [app. for the
