طنأ1
طَنِئَ, aor.
طَنَاَ, said of a camel, He had his
spleen adhering to his side. (K.) And, said of a
man, He had a tertian fever, and his spleen in
consequence became enlarged. (Lh, TA.) Thus

أَطْنَأَ [He suffered not to retain the last
remains of life]. One says, هٰذِهِ حَيَّةٌ لَا تُطْنِئُ
This is a serpent that will not suffer one to
survive; (S, O, K; *) that hills instantly: also
without ء, but originally with ء; from طِنْءٌ in
the first of the senses assigned to it below.
(S, O.)
طِنْءٌ The [last] remains of the vital spirit.
(S, O, K.) One says, تَرَكْتُهُ بِطِنْئِهِ I left him

-b2-  And
The remains of water in a watering-trough, or
tank. (O, K, TA.) And it is said that رَوْضَةٌ,
by which it is also expl. in the K [and in the O],
has this meaning [as well as that of A meadow,
&c.]; and therefore this explanation without the
former is given in the L. (TA.) ―

says, رُمِىَ فُلَانٌ فِى طِنْئِهِ [and فى طِنْيِهِ] and فى
نَيْطِهِ [Such a one was cast into his bier]; meaning, when he died. (AZ, TA.) ―

or malady. (K.)
-A2-  And Doubt, or suspicion, or
evil opinion; or a thing that occasions doubt or
suspicion or evil opinion; syn. رِيبَةٌ; (S, O, K,
TA; in the CK رُبْيَة;) and تُهَمَةٌ: (TA:) and so
طِنْىً. (TA in art. طنى.) Fr. cites,
كَأَنَّ عَلَى الطِّنْءِ عَيْنًا بَصِيرَةً
meaning, عَلَى ذِى الرِّيبَةِ [i. e. As though there
were a discerning eye upon him in whom is that
which occasions doubt, &c.]. (TA.)
