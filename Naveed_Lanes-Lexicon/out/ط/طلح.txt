طَلْحٌ, [a coll. gen. n.,] (S, A, Msb, K, &c.,)
and طِلَاحٌ; (S, A, K;) the latter said to be pl. of
طَلْحَةٌ, (TA,) which is the n. un. of طَلْحٌ, (S,)
or, accord. to Sb, the pl. of طَلْحَةٌ is طُلُوحٌ, like
as صُخُورٌ is pl. of صَخْرَةٌ; and طِلَاحٌ also; and
the pl. of طَلْحٌ is أَطْلَاحٌ; (M;) [The acacia, or
mimosa, gummifera; an appellation applicable
also to the سَنْط, which produces the gum-arabic:
(see صَمْغٌ:) the former tree is termed by Forskål
(Flora Ægypt. Arab. p. cxxiv.) “ mimosa gummifera; ” but it is more commonly termed an
“ acacia: ” its pods are termed عُلَّفٌ, q. v.:] a
species of large trees, (S, K,) of the kind called
عِضَاهٌ; (S, Msb;) growing in El-Hijáz [and
Egypt and Nubia and other countries]; the
fruit of which is like that of the سَمُرَة; having
curved thorns: the places in which it grows are
the interiors of valleys; and it is that species of
the عضاه which is the largest in its thorns, and
the hardest in respect of its wood, and the best in
respect of its gum: Lth describes it as above,
and says that it is the same as the أُمُّ غَيْلَانَ [and
the like is said in the A]: ISh says that it is a
tall tree, affording a shade in which men and
camels repose, with few leaves, long and large
branches, with many thorns, [more] than the
prickles of the palm-tree, and a great trunk,
which a man's arm cannot embrace; the same
as the امّ غيلان; and grows in the mountains:
AHn says that it is, of the trees called عضاه, the
largest, and that which has most leaves, and the
greenest, and has thick and long thorns, but these
are of the least hurtful of thorns, producing no
heat in the foot; it has a fruit (بَرَمَةٌ) of pleasant
odour; and there is not among the trees called
عضاه any that produces more gum than it, nor
any more bulky; and it grows only in rugged,
hard, fertile ground. (TA.) By طَلْح in the
Kur lvi. 28 may be meant the trees called امّ
غيلان, because they have a blossom of a very
pleasant odour. (Zj.) [But see below.] ―
-b2-  طَلْحٌ
signifies also Banana-trees; syn. شَجَرُ المَوْزِ; and
is said [by some] to have this meaning in the
Kur lvi. 28: (Zj, T, TA:) or i. q. مَوْزٌ [which
some expl. as meaning the trees above-mentioned;
but others as meaning the fruit of those trees]:
(Msb, K:) this, however, is said to be unknown
in the [classical] language. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And i. q.
طَلْعٌ [generally meaning The spadix of the palmtree; but sometimes the spathe thereof]: (K:) a
dial. var. of the latter word: (S:) mentioned by
ISk among words formed by the substitution of
one letter for another: and this meaning, also, it
is said [by some] to have in the Kur lvi. 28.
(TA.)
-A2-  And Remains of turbid water in a
watering-trough or tank. (K.)
-A3-  And Having
the belly void of food. (K.) ―
-b2-  See also طَلِيحٌ.
طِلْحٌ The tick; syn. قُرَادٌ; (S, A, K;) sometimes applied thereto; (S;) as also ↓ طَلِيحٌ: (S,
K:) or a large tick. (TA. [See حَمْنَانٌ.]) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] طِلْحُ مَالٍ (tropical:)  One who keeps to camels, or
cattle, and to the care of them, like as cleaves the
طِلْح, i. e. tick: (A:) a manager, tender, or
superintendent, of camels, or cattle; or a good
pastor thereof. (K.) ―
-b3-  And طِلْحُ نِسَآءِ (tropical:)  One
who follows, or goes after, women (K, TA) much,
or often. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And طِلْحٌ is also expl. as
signifying A pastor fatigued, or wearied: (K,
TA:) and [its pl.] طُلُحٌ, as signifying [simply]
pastors. (L.) El-Hotei-ah says, after mentioning
certain camels and their pastors,
إِذَا نَامَ طِلْحٌ أَشْعَثُ الرَّأْسِ خَلْفَهَا
هَدَاهُ لَهَا أَنْفَاسُهَا وَزَفِيرُهَا
When a pastor, dusty and shaggy or matted in
the hair of the head, sleeps behind them, [and they
become lost to him,] their breathing and their
vehement respiration occasioned by the fulness of
their bellies guides him to them, so that he finds
them, even if they be distant. (S, * L.) ―
-b5-  See
also طَلِيحٌ, in four places.
طَلَحٌ (thus correctly written, not طَلْحٌ as in
[some of the copies of] the S, TA) Enjoyment of
a life of ease and plenty. (S, K.)
طَلِحٌ an epithet applied to a camel. (A.)
You say إِبِلٌ طَلِحَةٌ and طَلَاحَى [the latter being
the pl.] Camels having a complaint (S, A, K) of
their bellies (S, K) from eating of the trees called
طَلْح: (S, A, K:) but [the meaning seems to be,
from eating thereof immoderately, for] Aboo-Sa'eed disapproves of the phrase ابل طلاحى as
meaning camels that have eaten of the طلح [and
become disordered thereby, though it appears from
what is said in art. عضه that camels are sometimes disordered by eating of any of the trees
called عِضَاه], asserting it to signify camels that
are fatigued, or wearied; for [he says that] the
طلح do not disorder camels, but are wholesome
food for them. (TA.) See also طَلِيحٌ, in two
places. ―
-b2-  And أَرْضٌ طَلِحَةٌ Land abounding with
the trees called طَلْح. (K.)
طَلْحَةٌ n. un. of طَلْحٌ [q. v.]. (S.)
-A2-  أُمُّ طَلْحَةُ
The louse. (TA.)
طَلْحِيَّةٌ meaning A piece of paper is a postclassical word. (K.)
طَلَاحٌ, as an attribute of a man, (tropical:)  Badness,
corruptness, or viciousness: (A:) contr. of صَلَاحٌ.
(S, L, K.)
طَلِيحٌ, (A, Mgh, Msb,) of the measure فَعِيلٌ in
the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, (Mgh, Msb,)
Rendered lean, or emaciated, (A, Mgh, Msb,)
applied to a camel; (A, Msb;) as also ↓ طَلِحٌ,
(A,) or ↓ طِلْحٌ, (K,) and ↓ طَالِحٌ, so applied,
by reason of fatigue, or of disease. (A.) Also, (S,
Mgh, K,) applied to a camel, and ↓ طِلْحٌ, (S, K,)
the latter, (S, MF,) and the former likewise, (MF,)
applied to the male and to the female of camels and
of other animals, (S, MF,) and ↓ طَلْحٌ, (K,) and
↓ طَلِحٌ, (L, TA,) Fatigued: (S, Mgh, K, TA:)
and in like manner, applied to a she-camel,
طَلِيحَةٌ and ↓ طِلْحَةٌ, (K, in the CK طَلْحةٌ,) but
the forms commonly known of these two epithets
thus applied are without ة, because each has the
signification of a pass. part. n., (MF,) and
↓ طَالِحٌ: (IAar, K:) the pls. are طُلَّحٌ and
طَلَائِحٌ, (S, K,) [both pls. of طَلِيحٌ,] meaning
fatigued, or jaded, and rendered lean, by travel,
(S,) and طَلْحَى, which last is [said by SM to
be] anomalous, because [he holds that] it has the
meaning of an act. part. n., [app. on the ground
that some expl. طَلِيحٌ as syn. with مُعْىٍ and
تَعِبٌ,] (TA,) and طُلُحٌ is another pl., [app. of
the second and third and fourth of the sings.
mentioned above,] signifying fatigued: (L, TA;)
and أَطْلَاحٌ is pl. [of pauc.] of طِلْحٌ. (S.) One
says نَاقَةٌ طَلِيحُ أَسْفَارٍ meaning A she-camel jaded,
and rendered lean, by journeys: (T, S:) and طَلِيحُ
سَفَرٍ, and سَفَرٍ ↓ طَلْحُ. (IAar, TA.) رَاكِبُ
النَّاقَةِ طَلِيحَانِ means The rider of the she-camel
and the she-camel are both fatigued, or jaded:
(L, K:) for رَاكِبُ النَّاقَةِ وَالنَّاقَةُ طَلِيحَانِ: or for
رَاكِبُ النَاقَةِ أَحَدُ الطَّليحَيْنِ. (L.)
-A2-  See also
طِلْحٌ.
إِبِلٌ طِلَاحِيَّةٌ and طُلَاحِيَّةٌ, (S, K,) the latter
anomalous, (S,) or the latter is a dial. var. of the
former, which is not a rel. n. from the pl. طِلَاحٌ,
because, when a rel. n. is formed from a pl., the
pl. is reduced to its sing. form, unless it is used
as a name of a particular thing, (from a marginal
note in copies of the S, [see also Ham pp.
791-2,]) Camels feeding upon the trees called
طِلَاح [or طَلْح]. (S, K.)
طَالِحٌ: see طَلِيحٌ, in two places. ―
-b2-  Also, as an
epithet applied to a man, (tropical:)  Bad, corrupt, or
vicious; (A, L;) in whom is no good: (L:)
contr. of صَالِحٌ. (S, L.)
مُطَلِّحٌ (assumed tropical:)  One who acts wrongfully, unjustly, or
injuriously, فِى المَالِ [with respect to property, or
camels, or cattle]. (Az, L.) ―
-b2-  And, accord. to
Az, One who breathes hard, or emits the voice
with a moaning sound, فِى الكَلَامِ [in speaking];
syn. نَهَّاتٌ [but the first letter in this word is
written in the L without any diacritical point; so
that the word may perhaps be بَهَّاتٌ, meaning
a great, or frequent, calumniator, slanderer, or
false-accuser: see art. بهت]. (L, TA.)
