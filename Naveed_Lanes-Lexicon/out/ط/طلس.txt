measure مَفْعُولٌ, (assumed tropical:)  Having the eye blinded: in

tablet (A, K, TA) upon which is writing, and
with which the writing is obliterated, or effaced.
(A, TA.)
طَيْلَسٌ: see طَيْلَسَانٌ.
طَالَسَانٌ: see طَيْلَسَانٌ.
طَيْلَسَانٌ (El-Fárábee, S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K)
and طَيْلِسَانٌ, (M, O, K,) the latter form used by
some, (El-Fárábee, Msb,) or by the vulgar, (S,)
and disallowed by As, (M, Msb,) and طَيْلُسَانٌ,
all these three forms being mentioned by 'Iyád
and others, (K,) [accord. to the TA, following
Lth; but the words of Lth, as cited in the TA,
and in the O, rather signify that, if, instead of
طَيْلِسَانٌ, with kesr to the ل, one said طَيْلُسَانٌ,
with damm to the ل, like خَيْزُرَانٌ and حَيْسُمَانٌ,
it would be more agreeable with analogy; and
the like is said in the Msb, as on the authority of
Az;] and ↓ طَيْلَسٌ (M, Mgh, O, K) and
↓ طَالَسَانٌ; (M, TA;) arabicized words, (S, Mgh,
Msb, K,) from the Pers., (S, Msb,) originally
تَالَسَانْ, (as in some copies of the K,) or تَالَشَانْ;
(as in other copies of the K, and in some copies
of the T, and thus written by El-Urmawee, as is
said in the TA, and thus written also in the
Mgh;) differently expl. by different persons;
(TA;) [app. accord. to the fashions of different
times and countries;] accord. to some, (TA,) A
certain kind of كِسَآء: (M, TA:) or a certain
article of apparel worn by the عَجَم [Persians or
other foreigners], (Mgh, Msb,) of a round form,
and black; accord. to the “ Jema et-Tefáreek,”
having its woof and warp both of wool: (Mgh:)
or a كِسَآء, of a dark, or an ashy, dust-colour,
(أَخْضَر,) worn by persons of distinction: (EshShereeshee, in Har, p. 238:) [see also بَتٌّ, and
سَاجٌ: El-Makreezee mentions a kind of طيلسان
having a round piece cut out from the middle of
it (مُقَوَّرٌ) worn by the Egyptian Wezeer, and
called, in his time, (the 14th and 15th centuries
of our era,) طَرْحَةٌ: (see this word: and see De
Sacy's Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed., ii. 267—269; and
Dozy's Dict. des Noms des Vêtements chez les
Arabes, 278—90:) it seems to have resembled
our academic hood, of which it was perhaps the
original: the term طيلسان is now commonly
applied to an oblong piece of drapery, or a scarf,
or an oblong shawl, worn in such a manner that
one end hangs down upon the side of the bosom,
the middle part being turned over the head and
under the chin, and the other end being thrown
over the shoulder, and hanging down upon the
back: this is worn by many of the professional
learned men in winter, in Arabian countries: it
is also used in the sense of the word عَذَبَةٌ,
meaning an end of a turban, when made to hang
down between the shoulders: see عَذَبٌ:] the pl.
(of طَيْلَسَانٌ and طَيْلِسَانٌ and طَيْلَسٌ, M) is طَيَالِسَةٌ,
(S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) in which the ة is
added because it is a foreign word, (S, M, K,)
and طَيَالِسُ; (M, A;) or the latter is pl. of
طَيْلَسٌ: (TA:) I do not know (says ISd) any
pl. of طَالَسَانٌ: (M, TA:) it is not allowable to
form an abbreviation of طَيْلِسَانٌ, with kesr to the
ل, as a compellation, because there is no instance
of the measure فَيْعِلٌ, with kesr to the ع,
except in infirm words such as سَيِّدٌ and مَيِّتٌ.
(S.) Hence the expression, (Mgh,) يَا ابْنَ
الطَّيْلَسَانِ, [lit., O son of the teylesán,] meaning,
O 'Ajamee, (A, Mgh,) or Aajamee, (K,) [i. e.,
Persian, or foreigner,] used in reviling another;
(Mgh, K;) for the عَجَم are those who [most
commonly] attire themselves with the طيلسان.

مَسِيحٌ.) ―
-b3-  A wolf whose hair has fallen off by

K:) or a wolf of a dusty colour inclining to

colour; (S, K;) whether a garment or any other
thing: (TA:) fem. طَلْسَآءُ: (M:) pl. طُلْسٌ. (A.)
―
-b4-  A man having little hair upon the side of the

-b5-  Dirty, or
filthy; as also ↓ طِلْسٌ: (K:) the latter applied
to a garment, or piece of cloth, (K, TA,) in the
colour of which is a dusty hue: (TA:) and طَلْسَآءُ
a dirty rag. (O.) ―
-b6-  A man (tropical:)  dirty, or filthy,

smoothness:] but this is not [of the classical]
Arabic: pl. طُلْسٌ. (TA.)
-A3-  فَلَكُ الأَطْلَسِ: see
أَثِيرٌ, last sentence.
