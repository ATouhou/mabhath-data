طَمٌّ, (K, TA,) said of water, It was, or became,

الوَادِى means [طَمَّ سَيْلُ الوَادِى i. e. The torrent
of the valley or water-course] rose high, or to a
high pitch, and predominated: whence the prov.,
جَرَى الوَادِى فَطَمَّ عَلَى القَرِىِّ; in explanation of
which Meyd says, i. e., [The torrent of the valley
or water-course (سَيْلُ الوَادِى) flowed, (so in the
Provs. of Meyd,)] and filled up, or choked up,
meaning destroyed by filling up, or choking up,
the channel by which the water ran into the
meadow: and he says that the prov. is applied to
the case in which evil exceeds the ordinary limit:
(Har p. 127:) [or, accord. to Z, it means a man's
overcoming his adversary: (Freytag's Arab.
Prov. i. 278:) but it should be observed that طَمَّ
in this sense is trans. without a prep.:] one says
of a torrent, (S, Meyd, and Har ubi suprà,)
طَمَّ الرَّكِيَّةَ, (S, Meyd, K, Har,) aor.

the next paragraph.
طِمٌّ The sea: (S, K, TA:) said to be so called
because of its overwhelming what is in it (لِأَنَّهُ
طَمَّ عَلَى مَا فِيهِ): but in this sense the word is
said to be ↓ طَمٌّ, and to be pronounced with kesr
for the purpose of assimilating it to رِمٌّ. (TA.)
One says, جَآءَ بِالطِّمِّ وَالرِّمِّ, meaning He brought
much wealth: (S, TA:) or the meaning in this
instance is الامر الكثير [app. a mistranscription
for الأَمْر الكَبِير i. e. that which was a great event]:
so says As: or much of everything: or much and
little: thus accord. to Aboo-Tálib: or what was
moist and what was dry: or the leaves of trees,
and what had fallen off from them. (TA. [See
more voce رِم: and see also what here follows.])

also ↓ طَامٌّ/ [or مَآءٌ طَامٌّ]: (TA:) or the rubbish and

TA: [see also طَمُومٌ:]) called طِمٌّ because of.
his light and quick, or easy, running (لِطَمِيمِ
عَدْوِهِ); or as being likened to the sea, as a horse
is termed بَحْرٌ and سَكْبٌ and غَرْبٌ. (TA.) ―
-b7-
And A large ذَكَر: (K:) because its head is
مَطْمُوم [as though this epithet meant “ bare ”].
(TA.) ―
-b8-  الطِّمُّ is also said in the K to signify
الكَيِّسُ; but [SM says] I think that this is a
mistranscription for الطَّمُّ meaning الكَبْسُ [see
طَمَّ الرَّكِيَّةَ, in the first paragraph]. (TA.)
طُمَّةٌ A company, or congregated body, of men:
and the middle of them: one says, لَقِيتُهُ فى طُمَّةِ

him wallowing in his dung]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And A
portion (K, TA) of herbage, mostly (TA) of what
is dry, or dried up. (K, TA.)
طَمِمٌ Hardy, strong, or sturdy: occurring thus,
without idghám, in a verse of 'Adee Ibn-Zeyd;
applied to a beast such as is termed قَارِحٌ. (TA.)
فَرَسٌ طَمُومٌ A swift horse. (TA. [See also
طِمٌّ.])
طَمِيمٌ: see طِمٌّ. ―

طِمْطِمٌ and ↓ طُمْطُمَانِىٌّ (S, K) and ↓ طِمْطِمِىٌّ
(K) and ↓ طُمَاطِمٌ (TA) A man having a barbarousness, or vitiousness, or an impotence, or
impediment, in his speech, or utterance, not speaking clearly, or correctly: (S, K, TA:) and Aboo-Turáb explains [the pl. of the first] طَمَاطِمُ as
meaning foreigners (عَجَم). (TA.) Hence the
saying of the poet, (S,) 'Antarah, (TA,)
تَأْوِى لَهُ قُلُصُ النَّعَامِ كَمَا أَوَتْ
خِرَقٌ يَمَانِيَّةٌ لِأَعْجَمَ طِمْطِمِ
(S, TA;) respecting which Fr relates his having
heard El-Mufaddal say that one of the most
learned of men explained to him الخِرَقُ اليَمَانِيَّةُ
as meaning the clouds [app. likened to rags of
cloth of El-Yemen], and الأَعْجَمُ الطِمْطِمُ as
meaning the sound of thunder: (TA:) or the
latter hemistich is thus:
حِزَقٌ يَمَانِيَّةٌ لِأَعْجَمَ طِمْطِمِ
and the verse means, To whom (referring to a
male ostrich) repair the young ostriches, like as
herds of camels of El-Yemen repair to one who
is impotent, and indistinct, or incorrect, in speech:
he likens the male ostrich, in respect of blackness,
and want of speech, to an Abyssinian pastor impotent, and indistinct, or incorrect, in speech.
(EM p. 231.) ―
-b2-  طِمْطِمٌ signifies also A sort
of sheep, haring small ears, and أَغْبَاب [or what
resemble dewlaps], like the اغباب of oxen: they
are in the region of El-Yemen. (IDrd, TA.)
طَمْطَمَةٌ A barbarousness, or vitiousness, or an
impotence, or impediment, in speech, or utterance,
so that the speech is not clear, or correct. (TA.

طُمْطُمَانِىٌّ: see طِمْطِمٌ.
طُمْطُمَانِيَّةُ حِمْيَرَ The disapproved phraseology
[or pronunciation] of the dialect of Himyer, (K,
TA,) resembling the speech of the foreigners:

أَمْ]. (TA.)

أَذًى أَطَمُّ Vehement, or severe, annoyance,
molestation, harm, or hurt: in the TA carelessly
written اذا اطم; and there said to be from طَمَّتِ
الفِتْنَةُ, q. v. See also an ex. in the Ham p. 363;
where أَطَمْ occurs at the end of a verse for أَطَمَّ
used in a like sense; i. e. as an epithet, not as a
verb.]
أَطَامِيمُ is said in the K to signify The legs of
a beast: but AA says, respecting the phrase
مُسْتَعِدَّاتٌ أَطَامِيمُ in a verse of Ibn-Mukbil
describing a she-camel, that the former of these
words is used as meaning legs, and اطاميم means
brisk, active, or quick: and by another, or others,
this latter word is said to mean تَطِمُّ فِى السَّيْرِ, i. e.
that are quick in pace. (TA.)
شَعَرٌ مَطْمُومٌ means مَعْقُوصٌ [i. e. Hair plaited:

TA in art. زق.) And مَطْمُومُ الرَّأْسِ A man having
