طوع1
طَاعَ لَهُ, (T, S, O, Msb, K,) and طَاعَهُ, (Msb,)
first pers. طُعْتُ, (Zj, O, Msb, *) aor. يَطُوعُ, (T, S,
O, Msb, K,) inf. n. طَوْعٌ; (T, Msb, TA;) and,
first pers. طِعْتُ, (Zj, O, Msb, *) aor. يَطَاعُ, (T,
O, Msb, K,) a good dial. var., (T, TA,) and
يَطِيعُ, (Msb, and K in art. طيع,) inf. n. طَيْعٌ;
(TA in art. طيع;) three dial. vars., coordinate to
قَالَ and خَافَ and بَاعَ; (Msb;) He was, or became, submissive to him; (S, O, Msb, K;) as
also له ↓ انطاع; (AO, S, O, Msb;) and ↓ اطاعهُ,
inf. n. إِطَاعَةٌ, and subst. [i. e. quasi-inf. n.]
↓ طَاعَةٌ: (Msb:) or i. q. ↓ اطاع; (T, TA;) which
is expl. by ISd as meaning he was, or became,
gentle, and submissive; as also طَاعَ, aor. يَطَاعُ:
(TA:) [or each of these two verbs may be rendered he was, or became, obedient; or he obeyed;
when by this is meant compliance with another's
will or wish, not with a command: but] one says,
↓ أَمَرَهُ فَأطَاعَهُ [He commanded him and he obeyed
him], with ا, not otherwise; (S;) or أَمَرَهُ قَأَطَاعَ
[he commanded him and he obeyed]; for it is said
that ↓ الطَّاعَةُ is never otherwise than a consequence
of a command; and IF says that when one goes
by command of another you say of him اطاعهُ:
(Msb:) Er-Rághib says that ↓ الطَّاعَةُ is like
الطَّوْعُ; but is mostly used as meaning obedience
to a command [or the like; whence the saying,
اَللَّهُمَّ لَا تُطِيعَنَّ لِى شَامِتًا, expl. in art. شمت]:
(TA:) and ↓ طاوعهُ, also, signifies he obeyed
him; like ↓ اطاعهُ: you say, عَلَى أَمْرِ ↓ طاوعهُ
كَذَا he obeyed him in respect of such an affair.
(MA. [But see 3 below.]) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] لِسَانُهُ لَا
يَطُوعُ بِكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  His tongue will not aid, or assist,
him with such a thing. (S, O.) See also 2.
[And see 3.] ―
-b3-  And sometimes (S) one says,
طَاعَ لَهُ المَرْتَعُ, (S, O, K,) like له ↓ اطاع, (ISk,
S, O,) or like اطاعهُ, (K,) meaning (tropical:)  The pasturage enabled him to pasture his cattle upon it
(S, O, K, * TA) wheresoever he would, (TA,) and
was ample to him; (O, TA;) and it was not inaccessible to him. (TA.)
2
تَطْوِيعٌ [primarily] signifies The making
obedient; or the causing to obey. (KL.) ―
-b2-
فَطَوَّعَتْ لَهُ نَفْسُهُ قَتْلَ أَخِيهِ, (S, O, Msb, * K, *) in
the Kur [v. 33], means (tropical:)  And his soul, or mind,
facilitated to him [the slaying of his brother];
(Akh, S, O, Msb, TA;) like طَوَّقَتْهُ; (Akh, S,
O, TA;) and like ↓ طَاوَعَتْهُ, [which is one of
the explanations in the O and K, and] which
means the same; (Msb;) and accord. to this
explanation it is tropical: Mbr says that it is
an instance of فَعَّلَتْ from الطَّوْعُ; and ↓ طَاعَتْ
and طَوَّعَتْ are said to signify alike: (TA:) or
the meaning is, aided him, or assisted him; (Fr,
O, K;) accord. to which explanation, and that
of Mbr, فِى is said by Az to be suppressed; the
meaning being, فِى قَتْلِ أَخِيهِ; or لِقَتْلِ أَخِيهِ; and
he prefers the explanation of Akh: (TA:) or the
meaning is, (O, K,) accord. to Mujáhid, (O,)
encouraged him, and (O, K) A 'Obeyd says that
by this Mujáhid meant (TA) aided him, and
complied with his wish. (O, K, TA,)
3
طاوعهُ, (IF, Msb, K, TA,) inf. n. مُطَاوَعَةٌ,
(S, O, TA,) and quasi-inf. n. طَوَاعِيَةٌ, (TA,) i. q.
وَافَقَهُ [as meaning He complied with him]. (IF,
S, * O, * Msb, K, * TA.) You say, طاوعت المَرْأَةُ
زَوْجَهَا, quasi-inf. n. طَوَاعِيَةٌ, The woman complied
with her husband. (TA.) It is said that طاوعهُ
differs from أَطَاعَهُ. (Msb, TA.) But see 1, latter
half, in two places. ―
-b2-  See also 2. ―
-b3-  One says
also, طاوع لَهُ المُرَادُ (tropical:)  The thing wished, or desired,
or sought after, [was, or became, easy of attainment to him; or] came to him easily. (TA.)
4
اطاع, inf. n. إِطَاعَةٌ, and quasi-inf. n. طَاعَةٌ:
see 1, in four places. It also signifies He consented; or complied with what was desired of
him; and so ↓ استطاع. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
اطاع لَهُ المَرْتَعُ: see 1, last sentence. One says
also, اطاع النَّخْلُ, (S, O,) and الشَّجَرُ, (S, O, K,)
(tropical:)  The palm-trees, (S, O, TA,) and the trees, (S,
O, K, TA,) had ripe fruit, that might be gathered.
(S, O, K, TA.) And اطاع التَّمْرُ (assumed tropical:)  The dates
attained, or were near, to the time, or season, for
their being cut off. (TA.)
5
تطوّع لِلشَّىْءِ and
تطوّعهُ He desired the thing;
or sought it; or sought it by artful, or skilful,
management: or he constrained himself to do it:
or he took it, or imposed it, upon himself submissively. (TA.) You say, تَطَوَّعْ لِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ حَتَّى
تَسْتَطِيعَهُ, (S,) and ↓ تَطَاوَعْ, (S, K, *) Constrain
thyself to acquire ability to perform this affair
until thou shalt be able to perform it. (S.) And
تطوّع بِالشَّىْءِ He did the thing without its being
incumbent, or obligatory, on him; syn. تَبَرَّعَ بِهِ.
(S, O, * Msb.) مَنْ تَطَوَّعَ خَيْرًا, in the Kur ii. 153
[and 180], means Whoso does good that is not
obligatory on him: (Jel:) or does good in obedience,
whether obligatory or supererogatory: or does
good beyond what is obligatory on him: (Bd:)
خَيْرًا being for بِخَيْرٍ: (Bd, * Jel:) or it is an
epithet qualifying an inf. n. suppressed: or the
verb is made trans. as implying the meaning of
أَتَى or فَعَلَى: (Bd:) and the Koofees, except
'Ásim, read يَطَّوَّعْ, for يَتَطَوَّعْ. (Az, * O, TA. *)
[Hence,] طَلَاةُ التَّطَوُّعِ The supererogatory prayer;
syn. النَّافِلَةُ. (O, K.) And Az says that تَطَوُّعٌ signifies A thing that one does spontaneously, not
made obligatory on him by an ordinance of God;
as though it were made a subst. (TA.)

استطاع, (S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. اِسْتِطَاعَةٌ,
(S, O, Msb,) originally اِسْتِطْوَاعٌ, (O, B, TA,)
i. q. أَطَاقَ [meaning He was able; and he was
able to do, or accomplish, a thing, and to acquire
or obtain it, and to have it, &c.]; (K, TA; [in
the CK, erroneously, أَطَاعَ, which, however, correctly explains one meaning of استطاع, as will be
seen by what follows;]) the inf. n. being syn. with
إِطَاقَةٌ, (S, O, TA,) or طَاقَةٌ, (Msb,) and قُدْرَةٌ:
(Msb, TA:) but it is said peculiarly of a human
being [or a rational creature], whereas اطاق is
used in a general manner: (IB, TA:) and the
application of the former requires a peculiar constitution of the agent, and the conception of the
act, and the fitness of the object to be acted upon
or effected, and the possession of an instrument
when the action is instrumental as in the case of
writing: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and one says also,
(K,) or sometimes they said, (S, O, Msb,) اِسْطَاعَ
(S, O, Msb, K,) aor. يَسْطِيعُ, (S, O, Msb,) with
fet-h [to the first letter]; (Msb;) rejecting the
ت, deeming it difficult of utterance with the ط,
and disliking to incorporate it into the ط because
the س would then become movent, which it never
is: Hamzeh (i. e. Ez-Zeiyát, TA, not Khallád,
O, K, TA) read, [in the Kur xviii. 96,] فَمَا
اسْطَّاعُوا, with idghám, combining two quiescent
letters: (S, O, K:) this reading is said by Zj,
as on the authority of Kh and Yoo and Sb and
others, to be incorrect; but Abu-l-'Abbás Ahmad
Ibn Mohammad Ibn-'Abd-El-Ghanee Ed-Dimyátee, who died in the year [of the Flight] 1116,
and Ibn-El-Jezeree, and El-Háfidh Aboo-'Amr,
contradict him, affirming it to be allowable:
(TA:) and Akh says, (S, O,) and some of the
Arabs say اِسْتَاعَ, aor. يَسْتِيعُ, (S, O, K,) rejecting
the ط; (S, O;) which Zj holds to be not allowable in reading [the Kur-án]: (TA:) and some
of the Arabs say أَسْطَاعَ, aor. يُسْطِيعُ, [in the CK,
erroneously, يَسْطِيعُ,] with the disjunctive ا [in
the former], meaning أَطَاعَ, aor. يُطِيعُ, (Akh,
S, O, K,) making the س to be a substitute for
the suppressed vowel of the medial radical letter
of the verb [اطاع], (Akh, S, O,) for, as is said
by Kh and Sb, أَطَاعَ is originally أَطْوَعَ; (TA;)
or, as AZ says, the verb in this case, with damm
to the aor., is likened to أَفْعَلَ, aor. يُفْعِلُ, inf. n.
إِفْعَالٌ: (Msb:) but Zj says that he who reads
فَمَا اسَطَّاعُوا errs; for the س of اِسْتَفْعَلَ is never
movent: and Sb mentions مَا أَسْتَتِيعُ; holding it
to be an instance of substitution. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See
also 4. Some say that هَلْ يَسْتَطِيعُ رَبُّكَ أَنْ يُنَزِّلَ
عَلَيْنَا مَائِدَةً مِنَ السَّمَآءِ, in the Kur [v. 112], means
هَلْ يُجِيبُ [i. e. Will thy Lord consent, or comply
with the desire, that He should send down to us a
table with food upon it from Heaven?]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) ―
-b3-  and Ks read هَلْ تَسْتَطِيعُ رَبَّكَ,
meaning Wilt thou demand of thy Lord that He
consent, or comply with the desire? (O, TA:) for
استطاعهُ signifies also He demanded his obedience,
and his consent, or compliance with what he desired of him. (TA.)
طَاعٌ accord. to the copies of the O and K; but
some say طَاعٍ accord. to the O: see طَائِعٌ, in three
places.
طَوْعٌ: see طَائِعٌ, in seven places.
طَاعَةٌ [quasi-inf. n. of 4: as a simple subst.,
sometimes meaning Submission, or submissiveness:

ing فُلَانٌ حَسَنُ الطَّوَاعِيَةِ لَكَ [Such a one is good
in obedience to thee]: (S, O, TA:) or it is a subst.
from 3 [q. v.]; and so ↓ طوَاعَة [app. طَوَاعَةٌ].
(L, TA.)
طَائِعٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ طَاعٌ, (O, K,) and
some say ↓ طَاعٍ, formed from طَائِعٌ by transposition, (O,) and ↓ طَيِّعٌ, signify the same, (S, O,
Msb, K,) i. e. Being, or becoming, submissive;
[or, simply, submissive; and obeying; or obedient;]
(Msb;) and ↓ طَوْعٌ, originally an inf. n., is likewise used as syn. with طَائِعٌ: (Ham p. 408:) the
pl. is طُوَّعٌ, (S, O, K,) i. e. pl. of طَائِعٌ, (S, O,)
and طَاعَةٌ is [also a pl. of طَائِعٌ, like as بَاعَةٌ is of
بَائِعٌ; or] syn. with مُطِيعُونَ: (TA in art. سوع:)
[whence one says, دَخَلَ فِى طَاعَتِهِ, and خَرَجَ مِنْ
طَاعَتِهِ, He entered among, and he quitted, his
obeyers, or those who obeyed him; i. e. he became
obedient, and he became disobedient, to him:] and
↓ مِطْوَاعٌ, (S, O, K,) pl. مَطَاوِيعُ, (TA,) is [app.,
agreeably with analogy, an intensive epithet,
meaning very submissive or obedient, but is said
to be, in like manner,] syn. with مُطِيعٌ, (S, O, K,)
applied to a man: (S, O:) and ↓ مِطْوَاعَةٌ, applied
to a man, [is app. a doubly intensive epithet; or]
is syn. with مِطْوَاعٌ: (TA:) and is applied to a
pl. number, as meaning compliant and submissive.
(Har p. 237.) One says, جَآءَ فُلَانٌ طَائِعًا Such a
one came [submissively, or obediently, or willingly,]
not being compelled against his will. (S, O.) And
a poet says,
حَلَفْتُ بِالبَيْتِ وَمَا حَوْلَهُ
↓ مِنْ عَائِذٍ بِالبَيْتِ أَوْطَاعِ
[I swore, or have sworn, by the House of God
(i. e. the Kaabeh), and what are around it, of
such as betakes himself for refuge to the House
or of such as renders obedience by visiting it].
(O.) And one says also, ↓ جَآءَ طَيِّعًا [He came
of his own accord, or willingly]. (M and TA
voce ذُو.) And اللِّسَانِ ↓ طَيِّعُ (tropical:)  A man chaste, or
eloquent, in speech. (TA.) And القِيَادِ ↓ نَاقَةٌ طَيِّعَةُ
and القِيَادِ ↓ طَوْعُ (assumed tropical:)  A she-camel that is gentle; [or
tractable;] that does not contend with her leader.

submissive to the bedfellow. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ
المَكَارِهِ ↓ طَوْعُ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is submissive to misfortunes, [being] subject thereto. (T, TA.) [See
also an ex. of ↓ طَوْع in a verse cited in art. شمت
voce شَامِتَةٌ.] السِّنَانِ ↓ هُوَ أَطْوَعُ means (assumed tropical:)  He is one
to whom the spear-head is subservient, howsoever
he will. (K in art. سن.)
طَيِّعٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in four
places.
أَطْوَعُ [as signifying More, and most, submissive
or obedient is regularly formed from طَاعَ; or] is
from الطَّاعَةُ [i. e. from أَطَاعَ], and similar to أَجْوَبُ
[from أَجَابَ, and therefore anomalous]. (M and
L in art. جوب.) أَطْوَعُ مِنْ فَرَسٍ, and مِنْ كَلْبٍ,
[More submissive, or obedient, that a horse, and
than a dog,] are provs. (Meyd.) ―
-b2-  [It app.
signifies also Very submissive or obedient: see an
ex. in a verse cited voce تَبَدَّعَ. ―
-b3-  And it is also
a simple epithet, like أَهْوَنُ &c.:] see طَائِعٌ, last
sentence.
شُحٌّ مُطَاعٌ means A niggardliness that is obeyed
by him who is characterized thereby, by the refusing
rights, or dues, (O, K,) which God has rendered
obligatory on him, in respect of his property:
occurring in a trad. of the Prophet. (O.) And
المُطَاعُ, as a name of the Prophet, means He
whose prayer is answered; whose intercession for
his people is accepted. (TA.)
مِطْوَاعٌ: see طَائِعٌ, first sentence.
مِطْوَاعَةٌ [an epithet of a very rare form, like
مِعْزَابَةٌ, q. v.]: see طَائِعٌ.
مُطَاوِعٌ an epithet applied by the grammarians
to (tropical:)  A verb that is intransitive [such as I term
quasi-passive; expl. as meaning a verb whose
(grammatical) agent receives the effect of the
action of the agent of another verb (فِعْلٌ يَقْبَلُ
فَاعِلُهُ أَثَرَ فِعْلِ فَاعِلِ فِعْلٍ آخَرَ)]. (S, O, TA.)
المُطَّوِّعَةُ and المُطَّوِّعِينَ: see what follows.
مُتَطَوِّعٌ A supererogator in any good act. (O,

its being incumbent, or obligatory, on him;
supererogatorily: or gratuitously, unasked, or

desiring, a compensation: syn. مُتَبَرِّعًا]. (S and
K in art. برع.) And ↓ المُطَّوِّعَةُ means Those
who exceed what is obligatory on them in fighting,
or warring, against unbelievers or the like; (S,
O, Msb;) originally المُتَطَوِّعَةُ: (Msb:) hence

المُتَطَوِّعِينَ. (S, O.)
