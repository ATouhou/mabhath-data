TA, the latter inf. n. is said to be with kesr, so
that it is like تِبْيَانٌ; but see this latter, which is
very extr.: see also تِطْوَافٌ below.]) ↓ لَأَطُوفَنَّ
طَوْفَهُ means the same as لَأَسْعَرَنَّ سَعْرَهُ [app. I will
assuredly practise circumvention like his practising
thereof]. (Fr, O and K in art. سعر, q. v.) ―

matter that comes forth from the child after suckling: (El-Ahmar, Msb, TA:) and by a secondary
application, (Msb,) human excrement, or ordure,

(Msb:) what Er-Rághib says respecting it indicates that this is metonymical. (TA.)
أَخَذَهُ بِطُوفِ رَقَبَتِهِ and رقبته ↓ بِطَافِ i. q. بِصُوفِ

طُوفَانٌ An overpowering rain: and overpowering water, [a meaning erroneously assigned in the
CK to طَوَّاف instead of طُوفَان,] that covers [or
overwhelms] everything; (S, K, TA;) in the
common conventional acceptation, water abounding to the utmost degree; [i. e. a flood, or deluge;]
such as befell the people of Noah; (TA;) or
طُوفَانُ المَآءِ signifies the water that covers [or overwhelms] everything: (Msb:) and a drowning

(K, TA:) and particularly (assumed tropical:)  death; or quick, or

using the phrase طُوفَانُ الظَّلَامِ; (Kh, S;) by
which he means (assumed tropical:)  the intensity of the darkness of
the night: (TA:) طُوفَانٌ is said to be a pl. [or
coll. gen. n.]; (Msb, TA;) and its sing. [or
n. un.] is طُوفَانَةٌ, (S, Msb, K, TA,) accord. to
analogy: (S:) thus says Akh: (S, TA:) or it is
an inf. n., like رُجْحَانٌ and نُقْصَانٌ; and is from
طَافَ, aor. يَطُوفُ: (Msb, TA:) thus says Abu-l-
'Abbás; and he says that there is no need of
seeking for it a sing.: some say that it is of the
measure فُلْعَانٌ, from طَفَا المَآءُ, aor. يَطْفُو, meaning
“ the water rose,” or “ became high; ” the ل
being transposed to the place of the ع; but this is
strange. (TA.)
طَوَافٌ [is an inf. n. of 1, q. v., sometimes used
as a simple subst., and] has for its pl. أَطْوَافٌ

-b2-  The
former signifies also A servant who serves one
with gentleness and carefulness: (K, TA:) pl.
طَوَّافُونَ: so says AHeyth: IDrd explains the
pl. as meaning servants, and male slaves. (TA.)
It is said in a trad., respecting the she-cat, that
it is not unclean, but is مِنَ الطَّوَّافِينَ عَلَيْكُمْ, or
الطَّوَّافَاتِ; [i. e. of those that go round about
waiting upon you;] she being thus put it. the
predicament of the slaves: whence the saying of
En-Nakha'ee, that the she-cat is like some of the
people of the house, or tent. (TA.) [In the
CK, a meaning belonging to طُوفَان is erroneously
assigned to طَوَّاف.]
-A2-  Also A maker of the طَوْف
that is composed of [inflated] water-skins [&c.]
upon which one crosses [rivers &c.]. (TA.)

-b4-  The طَائِف of
the bow is The part between the سِئَة [or
curved portion of the extremity] and the أَبْهَر
[q. v.]: (S, K:) or near [the length of a cubit or]
the bone of the fore arm from its [middle portion
called the] كَبِد [thus I render قَرِيبٌ مِنْ عَظْمِ
الذِّرَاعِ مِنْ كَبِدِهَا, which, I think, can have no
other meaning]: or the طَائِفَانِ are [two parts]
exclusive of the two curved ends (دُونَ السِّئَتَيْنِ):
(K: [this last explanation seems to leave one of
the limits of each طائف undefined:]) or, accord.
to AHn, the طائف of the bow is the part beyond
its كُلْيَة [q. v.], above and below, [extending] to
the place of the curving of the end of the bow: the
pl. is طَوَائِفُ. (TA.) ―
-b5-  لَأَقْطَعَنَّ مِنْهُ طَائِفًا occurs
in a trad. respecting a runaway slave, as meaning
[I will assuredly cut off] some one, or more, of
his أَطْرَاف [app. meaning fingers]: or, as some
relate it, the word is طَابَِقًا. (TA.) And Aboo-Kebeer El-Hudhalee says,
تَقَعُ السُّيُوفُ عَلَى طَوَائِفَ مِنْهُمُ
meaning, it is said, [The swords fall upon] arms
and legs or hands and feet [of them: but in this
case, طَوَائِف may be pl. of ↓ طَائِفَةٌ]. (TA.)
-A2-
One says also, أَصَابَهُ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ طَائِفٌ [A visitation from the Devil befell him]; and ↓ طَوْفٌ likewise, in the same sense. (TA. [See also
طَيْفٌ.])
طَائِفَةٌ A detached, or distinct, part or portion;
a piece, or bit; [or somewhat;] of a thing: (S,
Msb, K:) and a فِرْقَة of men [i. e. a party,
portion, division, or class, thereof; as those of
one profession or trade: a body, or distinct community: a sect: a corps: and sometimes a
people, or nation]: (Msb:) and a company, or
congregated body, (Msb, KL,) of men, at least
consisting of three; and sometimes applied to one;
and two: (Msb:) or one: and more than one:
(S, K:) so, accord. to I' Ab, in the Kur xxiv. 2:
(S:) or up to a thousand: (Mujáhid, K:) or at
least two men: ('Atà, K:) or one man; (K;) as
is said also on the authority of Mujáhid; (TA;)
so that it is syn. with نَفْسٌ [as meaning a single
person, or an individual]: (K:) [and sometimes
it is applied to a distinct number, or herd &c., of
animals:] Er-Rághib says that when a plural or
collective number is meant thereby, it is [what
lexicologists term] a pl. of طَائِفٌ; and when
one is meant thereby, it may be a pl. metonymically used as a sing., or it may be considered as
of the class of رَاوِيَةٌ and عَلَّامَةٌ and the like:
(TA:) [pl. طَوَائِفُ.] ―
