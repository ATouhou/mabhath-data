filled by repletion of the stomach, or by anger;
(O, K, TA;) as also اِظْرَوْرَى. (O.) [But the
former verb is also mentioned in the K, in art.

milked. (TA.) [See R. Q. 1, last sentence.]
طُرْ طُرْ is said in enjoining one to abide in the
neighbourhood of the House of God [at Mekkeh],
(O, K,) and to do so constantly: (K:) so says
IAar: (TA:) Az has mentioned it in this art.;
but if it be a word repeated, from طَارَ, aor. يَطُورُ,
its proper place is art. طور: the present art. would
be its proper place only if it were طَرْطِرْ [imperative of طَرْطَرَ]: (O:) [F says,] in my opinion it
should rightly be mentioned in art. طور; but Az
and others have mentioned it among reduplicate
words; therefore I have followed them, and
notified [the case]. (K.)

says, جَاؤُوا طُرًّا They came all; (S, TA;) and it is
said that طُرًّا is here in the accus. case as a denotative of state, or as an inf. n.: Sb mentions the
phrase مَرَرْتُ بِهِمْ طُرًّا I passed by them all; and
he says that the last word is used only as a
denotative of state: but Khaseeb En-Nasránee
used it otherwise; replying to one who said to
him, How art thou? أَحْمَدُ اللّٰهَ إِلَى طُرِّ خَلْقِهِ [I
praise God to all his creatures]; and the phrase
رَأَيْتُ بَنِى فُلَانٍ بِطُرٍّ I saw the sons of such a one,
all of them, has also been transmitted: some say
that طُرًّا in the first of the phrases above is put in
the place of an act. part. n., and is [originally]
an inf. n. (TA.)
طِرٌّ: see طُرَّةٌ, latter half.
طَرَّةٌ A single act of cutting [&c.: an inf. n. of 1,

act of initus: (O, L, K:) [used in relation to

it is [an imitation of a band, across the forehead,]
made of [the black substance called] رَامَك: as also
