طَلَبَهُ, (S, A, O, &c.,) aor.
طَلُبَ, (Msb,) inf. n.
طَلَبٌ (S, A, MA, O, Msb, K &c.) and مَطْلَبٌ
(A, MA, Msb) and طِلَابٌ and طِلَابَةٌ (A, MA)
and طَلِبَةٌ (MA) and تَطْلَابٌ [which is of a
measure denoting intensiveness]; (TA;) and
↓ اِطَّلَبَهُ; (S, A, O, Msb, K;) and ↓ تطلّبهُ; (A,
K;) [but see this last below;] He sought it,
desired it, demanded it, or asked for it; (MA;)
[he pursued it, pursued after it, or prosecuted it;]
he sought, desired, or endeavoured, to find it and
to get or take it: (A, K, TA:) and طَلَبَ is also
expl. as signifying اتبع [i. e. أَتْبَعَ he followed in
pursuit, &c.]. (TA.) One says, اُطْلُبْ لِى شَيْئًا
Seek thou, &c., for me, a thing. (Lh, TA.) And
طَلَبَهُ مِنْهُ and إِلَيْهِ, inf. n. as above, He sought it,
desired it, demanded it, or asked for it, of him.
(MA.) And طَلَبَ إِلَىَّ means رَغِبَ [i. e. He
petitioned me, or made petition to me, &c.]: (K,
TA:) or طَلَبَ إِلَيْهِ means سَأَلَهُ [he asked him]:
or [it means] طَلَبَهُ رَاغِبًا إِلَيْهِ [he sought him,
petitioning him]; for it is generally held that
طَلَبَ is not trans. by means of a prep., therefore
they explain the like of this phrase as implicative.
(MF, TA.) See also 4, in two places: and see 5.
You say also, طَلَبَهُ بِحَقٍّ, meaning طَالَبَهُ, q. v.
(K.) And طَلَبَ بِثَأْرِهِ and بِذَحْلِهِ [He sought to
obtain his blood-revenge, or retaliation; and in
like manner, طَلَبَ بِدَمِهِ]. (S and Msb in art.
ذحل.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] one says also, السِّرَاجُ يَطْلُبُ
أَنْ يَنْطَفِئَ (tropical:)  [The lamp, or lighted wick, is near,
or about, to become extinguished]; like as one
says, جِدَارٌ يُرِيدُ أَنْ يَنْقَضَّ. (A.)
-A2-  طَلِبَ, aor.
طَلَبَ,
(O, K,) inf. n. طَلَبٌ, (TK,) He, or it, [accord.
to the TK said of a man,] was, or became, distant,

طالبهُ, inf. n. مُطَالَبَةٌ and طِلَابٌ, (Msb, K,)
He sought or demanded of him a thing [as being
due to him; i. e. he sued or prosecuted him for
it]; (Msb;) i. q. بِحَقٍّ ↓ طَلَبَهُ [he sought or
demanded of him, &c., a right, or due]: (K:)
and you say, طالبهُ بِحَقٍّ لَهُ عَلَيْهِ [he sought or
demanded of him, &c., a thing due to him on his
part]. (A.) مُطَالَبَةٌ is used in relation to a real
thing: [but it does not necessarily imply the
justice of the act:] one says, طالب زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا
بِالدَّرَاهِمِ [Zeyd sought or demanded of 'Amr, or
sued or prosecuted him for, the money]. (Kull
p. 349.) And طالبهُ بِالدَّيْنِ He sought or demanded of him [&c.] the debt. (MA.) And
طالبهُ بِكَذَا, (S, O,) inf. n. مُطَالَبَةٌ, (S,) [He
sought or demanded of him, &c., such a thing;
or he prosecuted him for such a thing, as, for
instance, blood, or mutilation, or a wound: see
exs. voce خَبْلٌ.]
4
اطلبهُ He performed, or accomplished, for
him, (S, A, O, Msb, TA,) that which he sought,
or demanded, (S, A, * O, Msb,) or the object of
his want: (TA:) or he gave him that which he
sought, or demanded. (K.) A man said to the
Prophet, إِلَىَّ طَلِبَةً فَإِنِّى أُحِبُّ أَنْ أُطْلِبَكَهَا ↓ اُطْلُبْ
i. e. [Ask thou of me] an object of want, [for I
love] to perform it, or accomplish it, for thee.
(TA.) And one says, إِلَىَّ فَأَطْلَبْتُهُ ↓ طَلَبَ i. e.
[He asked of me a thing] and I performed, or
accomplished, for him that which he sought, or
demanded. (TA.) And اطلبهُ الشَّىْءَ He aided
him, or helped him, to seek the thing. (TA.)
And أَطْلِبْنِى Aid thou me to seek. (Lh, TA.)
―
-b2-  Also He, or it, (said of a man, Msb, and
of poverty, A,) necessitated his seeking, or demanding. (S, A, O, Msb, K.) Thus it has two
contr. significations. (S, O, K.) ―
-b3-  And hence,
(S, O,) أَطْلَبَ said of water, and of pasture, or
herbage, (S, A, O,) &c., (S, O,) It was distant,
or remote, (S, A, O,) so as to be not attainable
but by seeking, (S, O,) or so that it was sought. (A.)
5
تطلّبهُ He sought it, or demanded it, repeatedly, or time after time: (S, O:) [he made
repeated, or successive, endeavours to obtain it,
or to attain it: he prosecuted a search after it:]
or he sought it diligently, studiously, sedulously,
or earnestly; syn. اِبْتَغَاهُ: (Msb:) or he sought,
desired, or endeavoured, leisurely, to find it and
to get or take it; (O, TA;) and (TA) so ↓ طلّبهُ,
inf. n. تَطْلِيبٌ; (K, TA;) and ↓ طَلَبَهُ; (TA;)
from [various] places. (O, TA.) ―
-b2-  See also 1,
first sentence.
7
انطلب لَهُ is quasi-pass. of طَلَبَهُ, and means
It (an action [&c.]) was, or became, suitable to
him; or fit, meet, or proper, for him: [as though
it were sought, or desired, or desirable:] but they
have been content to use اِنْبَغَى in the place of
this verb. (Zj, TA in art. بغى. [يَنْبَغِى, in the
Kur xix. 93, is expl. by يَنْطَلِبُ in the Ksh and
in the Expos. of Bd.])

or demanded: (TK:) and طَلِبَةٌ signifies also an
