طبو1
طَبَاهُ, (S, K,) aor. يَطْبُوهُ, (S,) inf. n. طَبْوٌ;
(K;) and طَبَاهُ, aor. يَطْبِيهِ, (S, TA,) inf. n. طَبْىٌ;
(TA in art. طبى;) He called him: (S, K:) or,
accord. to Sh, he called him with a gentle calling:
(TA:) an ex. of the latter verb occurs in a verse
of Dhu-r-Rummeh cited voce ضَارِبٌ, (S,) or, as
Lh cited that verse, an ex. of the former verb:
(TA:) and ↓ اِطَّبَاهُ, (Sh, S, K, [in the CK
erroneously written اَطْبَاهُ,]) of the measure اِفْتَعَلَهُ,
(S,) signifies the same. (Sh, S, K.) And [hence]
one says, لاَ أَدْرِى مِنْ أَيْنَ اطبيت, [a mistranscription for طُبِيتَ,] with damm, and اطّبيت, [i. e.
↓ اطُّبِيتَ,] meaning [I know not whence thou hast
been called; or] whence thou hast come. (TA in
art. طبى.)

إِطْتَبَوَ see 1, in two places. ―
-b2-  One says also
اِطَّبَى بَنُو فُلَانٍ فُلَانًا, (S, K, TA, [in the CK,
erroneously, اَطْبَى,]) The sons of such a one
associated as friends with such a one and slew
him: (S, K, TA:) and اِطَّبَيْتُهُ I acted with him
as a friend, then I slew him. (IKtt, TA.) ―
-b3-
اِطَّبَى القُلُوبَ, in a trad. of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr, means
He showed love, or affection, to the hearts [of
others], and drew them near to him. (TA.)
And اِطَّبَاهُ signifies also He attracted him to
himself; or sought to make him incline. (TA.)
[
طباة (thus written without any vowel-sign) is
said in the TA, in art. طبى, to signify أَحْمَقُ (i. e.
Stupid, &c.): but I think it probable that this is
from a mistranscription for ظَبْأَةٌ, properly meaning “ a hyena; ” a beast proverbial for stupidity:
see ضَبُعٌ.]
طَبْوَآءُ: see طَبِيَةٌ, in the next art.
