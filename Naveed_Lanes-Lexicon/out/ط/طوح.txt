Accidents, or events, that cast into places of
perdition [cast him thereinto]: (MF, * TK:) one
should not say المُطَوِّحَاتُ: it is an extr. phrase,
(S, K,) like the phrase in the Kur [xv. 22],

interpretations thereof: (S:) and المَطَاوِحُ ↓ أَطَاحَتْهُ

caused him to fall thereinto; unless مَطَاوِحُ have
a signification which I do not find explained].
