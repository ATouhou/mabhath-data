طمع1
طَمِعَ فِيهِ (S, O, Msb, K, &c.) and بِهِ, (O, K,)
aor.
طَمَعَ, (O, K,) inf. n. طَمَعٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and
طَمَاعَةٌ, (S, O, TA,) accord. to all the copies of
the K [and my copy of the Msb] طَمَاعٌ, but this
is wrong, (TA,) and طَمَاعِيَةٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,)
without teshdeed, (S, Msb,) and طَمَاعِيَّةٌ, with
teshdeed, as in the L, but some disapprove this
last, (TA,) He coveted it; i. e. desired it vehemently, eagerly, greedily, very greedily, excessively,
inordinately, or culpably; or he strove to acquire,
obtain, or attain, it; syn. حَرَصَ عَلَيْهِ: (K, TA:)
طَمَعٌ signifying the longing, or yearning, for a
thing; or lusting after it; mostly, for the gratification of animal appetite, without any lawful
incitement: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and it is mostly
used in relation to that of which the occurrence,
or coming to pass, is [deemed] near: but sometimes طَمِعَ فِيهِ signifies he hoped for it. (Msb.)
[See also طَمَعٌ below. One says also, طَمِعَ فِى
فُلَانٍ, meaning He eagerly desired, or he hoped,
to make himself master of, or to overcome, such a
one: (see an ex. voce خَازِقٌ:) and طَمِعَ فِى فُلَانَةَ
he eagerly desired, or he hoped, to gain possession
of, or to win, such a woman; or he lusted after
her.] ―
-b2-  طَمُعَ, said of a man, means He became
very covetous; (صَارَ كَثِيرَ الطَّمَعِ: S, O, K:) [or
rather how covetous is he! for] it is a verb of
wonder; the verbs of wonder being of three
forms, accord. to rule; as in the exs. مَآ أَحْسَنَ
زَيْدًا and أَسْمِعْ بِهِ and كَبُرَتْ كَلِمَةً; from which
نِعْمَ and بِئْسَ are anomalous exceptions. (S, O.)

inscribed, أَقْلِبْنِى أَنْفَعْكَ [“ Turn me over, I will
benefit thee ”]: and he exercised his skill in
turning it over, and found [inscribed] on the
other side, يَهْدِى إِلَى طَبَعٍ ↓ رُبَّ طَمَعٍ [Many a
