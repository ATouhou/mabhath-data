طلف2
طلّف عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. تَطْلِيفٌ; (O, K;) and
ظلّف is a dial. var. thereof; (TA;) He exceeded
it; (O, K;) [meaning a certain number of years;
for] it is like ذَرَّفَ and رَمَّثَ and طَلَّثَ. (IAar,
TA in art. ظلف.)

اطلف [He escaped being a victim of his
adversary's blood-revenge; expl. as meaning] the
blood-revenge of his adversary was ineffectual, or
had not effect. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.)
-A2-  اطلفهُ He
made it [i. e. a man's blood] to go for nothing
[i. e. unretaliated, or uncompensated by a mulct];
or to be of no account. (S, O, K.) ―
-b2-  And He
gave him (S, O, K) a thing (O) as a free gift.
(S, O, K.)
طَلْفٌ: see the next paragraph in two places.
طَلَفٌ A thing that goes for nothing; [as blood
that is unretaliated, or uncompensated by a
mulct;] that is of no account, ineffectual, or null;
syn. هَدَرٌ; (S, O, K;) [and so ↓ طَلْفٌ, as shown
by what follows;] as also ↓ طَلِيفٌ. (O, K.)
You say, ذَهَبَ دَمُهُ طَلَفًا, (AA, S, O, K,) and
↓ طَلْفًا, (AA, O, K,) and ظَلَفًا and ظَلْفًا, (AA,
O,) His blood went for nothing; as a thing of no
account; ineffectually; or in vain; unretaliated,
or uncompensated by a mulct; syn. هَدَرًا, (AA,
S, O, K, TA,) and بَاطِلًا: and in like manner,
مَالُهُ [his property]. (TA. [See also تَلَفٌ.])
And Ru-beh says,
↓ كَمْ مِنْ عِدًى أَمْوَالُهُمْ طَلِيفُ
[How many enemies are there whose possessions
are things that have gone for nought !]. (O, as
an ex. of the last word in the sense of هَدَر.) ―
-b2-
And (S, O, K) hence (O) A gift; (S, O, K;) a
gift freely bestowed, not for any compensation.
(S, TA.) ―
-b3-  And A thing that is easy; or of
light estimation, paltry, or despicable; [as also
ظَلَفٌ;] syn. هَيِّنٌ. (IF, O, K.) ―
-b4-  And A redundant portion of a thing: (IF, O, K:) if this
be not what is meant by the saying that طَلَفٌ is
syn. with فَضْلٌ, this saying is of no account.
(IF, O.)
طَلِيفٌ: see طَلَفٌ, in two places. ―
-b2-  Also A
thing that is taken. (O, K. *) [And hence,
perhaps, the saying of Ru-beh cited above.] ―
-b3-
One says also, ذَهَبَ فُلَانٌ بِالمَالِ طَلِيفًا and ظَلِيفًا
i. e. Such a one went away with the property
without compensation. (Yoo, O.) ―
-b4-  And أَكَلَ
مَالَهُ فِى طَلِيف He devoured his property in a
vain, or an ineffectual, procedure. (O.)
