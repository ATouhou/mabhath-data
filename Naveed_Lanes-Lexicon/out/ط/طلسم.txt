طلسمQ. 1
طَلْسَمَ He (a man) made his face to be
displeasing, or odious; (M, L, TA;) he contracted it; or made it austere, or morose: and so
طَرْمَسَ, and طَلْمَسَ, (L, TA,) and طَرْسَمَ. (TA
in art. طلمس.) ―
-b2-  And He (a man) bent down
his head; or lowered his eyes, looking towards the
ground; or was, or became, silent; syn. أَطْرَقَ:
and so طَرْسَمَ. (S in art. طرسم; and TA.) ―
-b3-
[And, accord. to Golius, He receded, or drew
back, from fight; followed by عَنْ: (one of the
significations assigned in the K to طَرْسَمَ:) he
mentions this as on the authority of J: perhaps
he found it in a copy of the S in art. طرمس (in
which الطَّرْمَسَةُ is expl. as meaning الاِنْقِبَاضُ and
النُّكُوصُ), or in some other art. of that work in
which I do not remember to have seen it.
-A2-
Also He sculptured, engraved, or inscribed, a
thing with talismanic devices or characters. And
He charmed, or guarded, or preserved, by means
of a talisman. See what follows.]
طِلَسْمٌ, or, accord. to MF, طِلَّسْمٌ, [also written
طَلِسْمٌ, and طِلِسْمٌ, and طِلِّسْمٌ, and طَلْسَمٌ, and
طَلْسِمٌ, and طِلْسَمٌ,] said by MF to be a Pers.,
or foreign, word; [perhaps from a late usage of
the Greek
τέλεσμα;] but [SM says] in my
opinion it is Arabic; a name for A concealed
secret; [i. e. a mystery: hence our word talisman: accord. to common modern usage, it signifies mystical devices or characters, astrological
or of some other magical kind: and a seal, an
image, or some other thing, upon which such
devices, or characters, are engraved or inscribed;
contrived for the purpose of preserving from enchantment or from a particular accident or from
a variety of evils, or to protect a treasure with
which it is deposited, or (generally by its being
rubbed) to procure the presence and services of a
Jinnee, &c.:] pl. طَلَاسِمُ (TA) [and طِلَسْمَاتٌ or
طِلَّسْمَاتٌ &c.].
