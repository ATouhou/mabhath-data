إِطْتَبَىَ see the preceding paragraph: and see also
the same verb in art. طبو.
طُبْىٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.) and ↓ طِبْىٌ (S,
K) [A teat, or dug, of any of certain animals
mentioned in what follows; agreeably with an explanation of its pl. in the O, voce ضَرْعٌ, on the
authority of AZ; and agreeably with a usage of
its pl. in the TA, voce خِلْفٌ, on the authority of
Lth: this is the most usual, if not the only
proper, signification:] the ضَرْع [which sometimes
means the teat, or dug, and is app. here used in
this sense]; mostly, of a beast of prey: (Mgh:)
or it is to the beast of prey, and to the solid-hoofed
animal, (As, T, S,) like the ضَرْع to others; and
sometimes to the camel; (S;) or that of the
camel and of the cloven-hoofed animal is termed
خِلْفٌ: (As, T:) or, to the camel, and to the
cloven-hoofed animal, like the ثَدْى [which some-
times means the teat] to the woman; and in rare
instances, to the solid-hoofed animal, and to the
beast of prey: (Msb:) or the حَلَمَات [meaning
teats], (K, TA,) or, accord. to the M, the
حَلَمَتَانِ [meaning pair of teats], (TA,) of the ضَرْع
[or udder], of the camel, and of a cloven-hoofed
animal, and of a solid-hoofed animal, and of a
beast of prey: (K:) [and ↓ طُبْيَةٌ is perhaps a
dial. var.: (see خَاتَمٌ, last sentence but two:)]
pl. أَطْبَآءٌ. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.) It is said in a
prov., (S,) [and] in a letter of 'Othmán to 'Alee,
(TA,) جَاوَزَ الحِزَامُ الطُّبْيَيْنِ (S, K) The girth
passed beyond the طُبْيَان [or two teats, or two pairs
of teats]; (TA;) meaning (assumed tropical:)  the affair, or case,
became distressing, and formidable. (K, TA.) ―
-b2-
El-Hoseyn Ibn-Muteyr uses the pl. metaphorically in relation to rain, by way of comparison,
saying,
كَثُرَتْ كَكَثْرَةِ وَبْلِهِ أَطْبَاؤُهُ
فَإِذَا تَجَلَّتْ فَاضَتِ الأَطْبَآءُ
[in which, for تَجَلَّتْ, I read تَحَلَّبَ; for the
verse, literally rendered, seems to mean, (tropical:)  Its
teats were abundant as the abundance of its heavy
rain, (or rather I would read لِكَثْرَةِ وبله by reason
of the abundance &c.,) so that when it flowed
with rain, as though it were milked, the teats
poured forth exuberantly]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  أَطْبَآءُ الكَلْبَةِ
(assumed tropical:)  [Bitch's dugs] is an appellation of the tree called
مُخَاطَة [i. e. the sebesten]. (TA in art. مخط, q. v.)
طِبْىٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
طُبْيَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
طَبِيَةٌ, like فَرِحَةٌ, on the authority of Fr, in the
K erroneously written طَبِيَّةٌ, (TA,) [and also
there misplaced, for, with فَهِىَ (in the CK فَهُوَ)
preceding it, it should follow immediately after
the explanation of the phrase طَبِيَتِ النَّاقَةُ, being
the part. n., and thus signifying Whose طُبْى is
flaccid, flabby, or pendulous,] applied to a she-camel; (Fr, TA;) and طَبْوَآءُ signifies the same;
(Fr, K, TA;) or this is applied to a she-goat,
meaning whose dugs (خِلْفَاهَا) descend towards the
ground. (So in one of my copies of the S: in the
other copy omitted.)
خِلْفٌ طَبِىٌّ i. q. مُجِيبٌ [meaning Yielding
milk]; (S, K; [thus in my copies of the S, and
in copies of the K; but said in the TA to be
written in the K and in the copies of the S,
مُجَيَّبٌ, which is evidently wrong;]) as though
called, and answering the call. (JM.)
