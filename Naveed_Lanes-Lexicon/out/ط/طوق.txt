inf. n. تَطْوِيقٌ, (TA,) He attired him with a طَوْق
[or neck-ring]. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] طَوَّقْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ
means (assumed tropical:)  I made the thing to be [as though it
were] his طَوْق [or neck-ring]: and thereby is
expressed the imposing [upon one] a thing that

وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ يُطَوَّقُونَهُ, [in the CK, erroneously,
يُطَوِّقُونَهُ,] meaning, (assumed tropical:)  And upon those who shall
have it put [upon them] like the طَوْق upon

which is like the saying يُجَشَّمُونَهُ and يُكَلَّفُونَهُ
[i. e. shall have it imposed upon them as a thing
that is difficult, troublesome, or inconvenient]:
(TA:) another reading is ↓ يَطَّوَّقُونَهُ, [in the CK,
erroneously, يُطَّوَّقُونَهُ,] originally يَتَطَوَّقُونَهُ [meaning the same as the former reading]: and another,
↓ يُطَيَّقُونَهُ, originally يُطَيْوَقُونَهُ [also meaning the
same; in the CK, erroneously, يُطَيْقُونَهُ]: and

meaning (assumed tropical:)  He made it, namely, a sword, &c.,
to be to him a طَوْق [or thing encircling, or going
round, his neck]. (TA.) And طَوَّقَنِى نِعْمَةً
(tropical:)  [He conferred upon me a permanent badge of
favour]: and طُوِّقْتُ مِنْهُ أَيَادِىَ (tropical:)  [I had permanent badges of favours from him conferred
upon me]: and the verb is also used [in like
manner] to denote dispraise, to which it has been
erroneously said by some to be restricted. (TA.

(K,) inf. n. إِطَاقَةٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) and طَاقَةٌ is

↓ طَاقَهُ, (Az, * K,) aor. يَطُوقُ, (Az, TA,) inf. n.

human being, as some assert it to be; but is used
in a general manner. (TA.) [One says لَا يُطَلقُ
meaning He will not be, or is not to be, coped
with: and also as meaning it is not to be done, or
to be borne, endured, or tolerated: and so مَا يُطَاقُ:

and he bore it, and he took it upon himself, like

Q. Q. 2
يَطَّيَّقُونَهُ, originally يَتَطَيْوَقُونَهُ: see 2.
طَاقٌ A curved construction or structure; (S,
O, K;) [said to be] a Pers. word arabicized; (S,
O;) and its pl. is طَاقَاتٌ and طِيقَانٌ: (S, O, K:)
or an arch of a building, wherever it is; and the
pl. is أَطْوَاقٌ and طِيقَانٌ: (JK, TA:) and as signifying [thus, or] an arch constructed with bricks,
it is [said to be] originally ↓ طَائِقٌ; and therefore
to have for its pl. طَوَائِقُ: so says Az. (TA.)
[It is often applied to An arched gateway or
doorway: and to a vault. And] i. q. كُوَّةٌ [i. e.
A mural aperture; a hole, or an aperture, in a
wall; a meaning also assigned to إِفْرِيزٌ, by which
طَاقٌ will be found to be expl. in what follows:
or a niche in a wall; which, as also a window,
is now often called ↓ طَاقَةٌ]. (So in the Munjid
of Kr.) [And app. A kind of arched construction with a flat top which forms a shelf, against a
wall. (See رَفٌّ and سَهْوَةٌ.)] And i. q. إِفْرِيزٌ [which
is expl. as meaning a projecting roof or covering
of a wall: and a projecting coping, or ledge, or
cornice, surrounding the upper part of a wall:
and in the KL as meaning a hole, or an aperture,
of a wall; (as mentioned above;) but its author
adds “ so we have heard ”]: (MA voce إِفْرِيزٌ:)
or so أَطْوَاقٌ. (JK, and O on the authority of
Ibn-'Abbád. [But this I think doubtful, and the
more so as it will be seen in what follows that
another meaning assigned in these same lexicons
to أَطْوَاقٌ is said by IB to be a meaning of طَاقٌ.])
―
-b2-  See also طَائِقٌ, in two places. ―
-b3-  [Also A

cases placed over, or under, a similar piece or

lined, or faced, or otherwise combined, with another
similar thing: pl. طَاقَاتٌ.] You say طَاقُ نَعْلٍ
[A single piece of leather of a sole that consists of
two or more of such pieces]; (S, O, K;) and
نعْلٍ ↓ طَاقَةُ [which means the same]. (K.) And
نَعْلٌ طَاقٌ وَاحِدٌ A single sole; i. e. a sole of a
single piece; not made of two pieces sewed together,
one upon the other. (TA in art. نعل.) And [in
like manner] a garment is said to be طَاقٌ وَاحِدٌ

stuffed]. (Az, in TA in art. سمط, [where this
meaning is clearly indicated,] and Th, in M,
same art.) Thus one says سَرَاوِيلُ طَاقٌ وَاحِدٌ
[Trousers, or drawers, of single cloth]. (Th, M

the phrase السَّرَاوِيلُ الطَّاقُ voce رِجْلٌ.] One says
also غَزْلٌ طَاقٌ وَاحِدٌ [Spun thread that is a single
yarn]: and غَزْلٌ مَفْتُولٌ طَاقَيْنِ [Spun thread
twisted of two yarns]. (S and TA in art. سحل.)

meaning green; but when applied to a garment
commonly meaning, as used by the Arabs, of a

think doubtful.]) ―
-b4-  And A [woman's muffler,
or head-covering, such as is called] خِمَار. (IAar,

the neck; (K;) a thing well known: (Msb:) [its
most usual from is figured in my work on the
Modern Egyptians, Appendix A:] pl. أَطْوَاقٌ.
(S, O, Msb, K.) It is said in a prov., كَبِرَ عَمْرٌو
عَنِ الطَّوْقِ ['Amr has become too much advanced
in age for the neck-ring]: (A 'Obeyd, O, K, TA:
in some copies of the K [erroneously] كَبُرَ:) or
شَبَّ عَمْرٌو عَنِ الطَّوْقِ, [which has the like meaning,] as in most of the books of proverbs: (TA:)
applied to him who occupies himself with a thing
that is beneath his ability. (K. [For the story
of the origin of this prov., see Freytag's Arab.
Prov. ii. 319-21, or Har pp. 502-3; as it is too
long to be quoted here.]) ―
-b2-  And Anything that
surrounds another thing (Msb, K) is called its
طَوْق. (Msb.) ―

decoration]: and فِى عُنُقِى طَوْقٌ مَا لِى بِأَدَآءِ شُكْرِهِ
طَوْقٌ (tropical:)  [Upon my neck is a permanent badge or

هِىَ الأَطْوَاقُ وَالنَّاسُ الحَمَامُ
[Favours of his have remained upon the necks:

have not ability, or power, to do it, or to bear or
endure or tolerate it: and, to cope with him:
(see Kur ii. last verse: and verse 250:) and]
↓ هُوَ فِى طَوْقِى It is within my ability, or power.
(S.) In the phrase طَلَبْتَهُ طَاقَتَكَ, [as meaning
Thou soughtest him, or it, in thy state of ability, or
power,] Sb says, the [quasi-] inf. n. is prefixed [to
the pronoun, and thus rendered determinate],

and accord. to As, a prominence projecting from
a ship, or boat, like a ledge swelling out from a
mountain: and also, he says, a ridge, or ledge,

K, TA:) AHn says, (O, TA,) it is very intoxicating; (O, K, TA;) moderately as long as its
drinker does not go forth to the wind; but if he

TA;) and when he who is not accustomed to it,
(O, K, TA,) and is not suited to it, (O, TA,)
continues constantly the drinking of it, it vitiates
his intellect, (O, K, TA,) and confuses his
understanding: (O, TA:) when it remains until
the morrow, it becomes most acid vinegar. (K,
TA.)
