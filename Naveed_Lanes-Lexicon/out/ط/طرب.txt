طرّب, (TA,) inf. n. تَطْرِيبٌ, (K,) He sang.
(K, TA.) And طرّب فِى صَوْتِهِ He trilled, or
quavered, and prolonged, his voice: (Msb:) or
التَّطْرِيبُ فِى الصَّوْتِ is the prolonging of the voice,
and modulating it sweetly. (S, TA.) And, said
of a bird, or, accord. to some, peculiarly of the
مُكَّآء, It prolonged its voice, and trilled, or
quavered, it, or warbled. (TA.) And in like
manner, طرّب فِى قِرَآءَتِهِ (A, TA) He prolonged,

-A2-  طّربهُ: see 4. ―
-b2-  [Freytag
adds that, in the “ Fákihet el-Khulafà,” p. 42, l.
5 infr., it means He asserted him to have sung
excellently.]
4
اطرّبهُ He, (S,) or it, (one's voice, A,)
caused him to be affected with طَرَب [i. e. emotion,
or a lively emotion, &c.]; as also ↓ تطرّبهُ; (S,
A;) [and ↓ طرّبهُ; for] تَطْرِيبٌ signifies the same
as إِطْرَابٌ, like ↓ تَطَرُّبٌ; (K:) [generally, he, or
it, rendered him lively, brisk, or sprightly: and]
اطربهُ is said of joy, and of grief, meaning [it
affected him with طَرَب; or] it rendered him restless, or unsteady. (MA.)
5
تَطَرَّبَ see the next preceding paragraph, in two
places.
10
استطرب He, or it, sought, or demanded,
طَرَب [i. e. emotion, or a lively emotion, &c.], (K,
TA,) and diversion, sport, or play. (TA.) ―
-b2-
And They (a party, or company of men,) became
affected with intense طَرَب. (A, TA.)
-A2-  استطرب
الإِبِلَ He put in motion the camels by urging them
with singing. (K.) You say استطرب الحُدَاةُ
الإِبِلَ [The drivers, singing to them, excited, moved,
or stirred, the camels,] when the camels have become lively, brisk, sprightly, or agile, because of
their urging them with singing. (O, TA.) Az
cites the saying of Et-Tirimmáh,
وَاسْتَطْرَبَتْ ظُعْنُهُمْ لَمَّا احْزَأَلَّ بِهِمْ
آلُ الضُّحَى نَاشِطًا مِنْ دَاعِبَاتِ دَدِ
but in his poem it is وَاسْتَطْرَفَتْ, with فَاء [i. e.
with the letter ف]: (O:) [this latter reading is,
I doubt not, the right; and the meaning seems
to be, And their women borne in the camel-vehicles, when the mirage of the early part of the
forenoon elevated them to the eye, elicited anew
longing desire for their homes, or accustomed
places, from jocose, sportful females, lit., from
jesting females of sport or diversion: the verse as
cited by Az may admit of a similar rendering if
we suppose استطربت to be there used tropically:
the writer of my copy of the TA has endeavoured, in marginal notes in the present art. and
in art. دد, but in my opinion unsatisfactorily, to
explain it; and has supposed استطربت to mean
طَرِبَت: his two notes, moreover, are inconsistent:] نَاشِطًا in this verse means شَوْقًا نَازِعًا.
(K in art. دد. [The verse is there cited with two
readings differing from the words given by Az;
وَاسْتَطْرَقَت, thus written with ق instead of ف, a
manifest mistake, and مِنْ دَاعِبٍ دَدِدِ.]) ―
-b2-
استطربهُ signifies also He asked him to sing.
(A, TA.)
طَرَبٌ Emotion, or a lively emotion, or excitement, agitation, or unsteadiness, (خِفَّةٌ, S, A,
Msb, K,) [of the heart or mind,] by reason of joy
or grief, (A, K,) or of intense grief or joy, (S,) or
of intense fear or joy: (Msb:) or joy, mirth, or
gladness: and the contr., i. e. grief, sadness, or
sorrow: (Th, K:) or, as some say, the lodgement of joy, mirth, or gladness, and departure of
grief, sadness, or sorrow: so in the M: (TA:)
the vulgar apply it peculiarly to joy; (Msb;)
[but] the application of it peculiarly to joy is a
mistake: (K:) it signifies also motion; syn.
حَرَكَةٌ: (K:) it is said in the M, Th says that
الطَّرَبُ is derived from الحَرَكَةُ; whence it seems
that الطَّرَبُ is, in his opinion, syn. with الحَرَكَةُ;
but [ISd adds] I know not this: (TA:) [it does,
however, obviously imply the signification of
motion, either ideal or actual:] also desire, or
yearning or longing of the soul: (K:) the pl. is
أَطْرَابٌ. (TA.) A poet says, (S,) namely, En-Nábighah El-Jaadee, using it in relation to
anxiety, (TA,)
فِى إِثْرِهِمْ ↓ وَأَرَانِى طَرِبًا
طَرَبَ الوَالِهِ أَوْ كَالْمُخْتَبَلْ
[And I perceive myself to be affected with
emotion, or a lively emotion, after them, (i. e.
after the loss of them,) with the emotion of him
who is bereft of offspring or friends, or like him
who is insane in mind]: (S, TA:) الوَالِه here
signifies الثَّاكِل; and المُخْتَبَل means مَنْ جُنَّ
فِى عَقْلِهِ. (TA.)
-A2-  And [the pl.] أَطْرَابٌ signifies Choice sweet-smelling plants: (K:) or
[simply] sweet-smelling plants: (TA:) and the
more fragrant of such plants. (O, TA.)
طَرِبٌ Affected with طَرَب [i. e. emotion, or a
lively emotion, &c.]: (S, A, O, Msb, TA:) pl.
طِرَابٌ. (A, TA,) A Hudhalee says,
بَاتَتْ طِرَابًا وَبَاتَ اللَّيْلَ لَمْ يَنَمِ
[They passed the night joyful, or glad, and he
passed the night without sleeping]: (O, TA:)
meaning that the [wild] bulls or cows, thirsting,
passed the night joyful on account of the lightning that they saw, and the water for which they
hoped in consequence thereof. (TA.) See also
another ex. in the verse cited voce طَرَبٌ. ―
-b2-  إِبِلٌ
طِرَابٌ means Camels yearning for their accustomed
places of abode: (S, O, TA:) or they are so
termed when they are excited (إِذَا طَرِبَتْ) by
reason of their drivers' urging them with singing.
(A, TA.)
-A2-  Also The head [meaning the hair of
the head]: so called because of the sound that it
makes when it is twisted with fingers: occurring
in the phrase حَتَّى يَرْنَأَ الطَّرِبَ [That he may dye
the hair of the head with يُرَنَّأ, i. e. حِنَّآء].
(L, TA.)
طَرُوبٌ (A, O, Msb, K, TA) and ↓ مِطْرَابٌ (A,
O, K, TA) and ↓ مِطْرَابَةٌ [which is of a very unusual form (see مِعْزَابَةٌ)], (Lh, K, TA,) applied to
a man, (O, K, TA,) Much, or often, affected with
طَرَب [i. e. emotion, or lively emotion, &c.]: (O,
Msb, TA:) [but the last is doubly intensive,
signifying very much, or very often, so affected:]
pl. [of the second and third] مَطَارِيبُ. (A.) One
says, ↓ إِذَا خَفَقَتِ المَضَارِيبُ خَفَّتِ المَطَارِيبُ
[When the plectra of the lutes quiver, the persons
who are wont to be affected with emotion become
lively, or light-hearted]. (A, TA.) And حَمَامَةٌ
↓ مِطْرَابٌ [A pigeon that cooes much or often].
(A, TA.) And ↓ إِبِلٌ مَطَارِيبُ [Camels that
yearn much, or often, for their accustomed places
of abode: or that are much, or often, excited by
reason of their drivers' urging them with singing:
see طَرِبٌ]. (A, TA.)
مَطْرَبٌ and ↓ مَطْرَبَةٌ A separate, or straggling,
road, or way: (S, O:) or a narrow road, or
way: (K:) or the former, a conspicuous road or
way: (IAar, TA:) and the latter, a small road,
or way, leading into a great one: or a narrow
road, or way, apart from others: (TA:) or a
small road, or way, branching off from a main
road: (O:) pl. مَطَارِبُ: (S, O:) [it is said (but
see 1, last sentence,) that] there is no verb corresponding thereto. (TA.) A poet says, (S,) namely,
Aboo-Dhu-eyb, (O, TA,)
وَمَتْلَفٍ مِثْلِ فَرْقِ الرَّأْسِ تَخْلِجُهُ
مَطَارِبٌ زَقَبٌ أَمْيَالُهَا فِيحُ
(S, O, TA) i. e. Many a desert tract, like the
division of the hair of the head in narrowness,
narrow conspicuous [or straggling] roads, or
ways, [whereof the portions over which the eye
can reach are far-extending,] protract; some of
these roads, or ways, tending this way and some
that way. (TA. [مطارب is here with tenween
for the sake of the measure. See also زَقَبٌ.
Perhaps the poet means to liken the said roads
to the ropes of a tent.]) It is said in a trad.,
↓ لَعَنَ اللّٰهُ مَنْ غَيَّرَ المَطْرَبَةَ [May God curse him
who alters the مطربة]; i. e., the road thus called.
(TA.)
مَطْرَبَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
two places.
مِطْرَابٌ, and its pl.: see طَرُوبٌ, in four places.
