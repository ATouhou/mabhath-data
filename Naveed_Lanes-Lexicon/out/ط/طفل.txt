بَنَانٌ طَفْلٌ [Soft, or tender, fingers, or ends of
fingers]; this being allowable, though بنان is a
[kind of] pl. and طفل is a sing., because every
pl. [of the kind] that differs not from its sing.
save in the ة [affixed to the latter] is made sing.
and masc. [as well as fem.]: and therefore
Homeyd says,
فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَ اللِّبْسَ عَنْهُ مَسَحْنَهُ
بِأَطْرَافِ طَفْلٍ زَانَ غَيْلًا مُوَشَّمًا

some say, (Msb,) [and] thus says El-Munáwee:
(TA:) or, accord. to Az, (Msb, TA,) on the
authority of AHeyth, (TA,) a child from the

Mgh, Msb, TA:) and pl. أَطْفَالٌ: (Zj, S, O, Msb,
TA:) but طِفْلٌ is also used as fem., (Zj, Mgh,

طُفُولَةٌ: see what next follows.
طُفُولِيَّةٌ, mentioned by ISd and the expositors
of the Fs and others, as well as in the K, and
also pronounced without teshdeed, [i. e. طُفُولِيَةٌ,]
which shows, as do several other reasons, that
the ى therein is not that which is the characteristic of rel. ns., though it has been asserted to be
so, (MF, TA,) The state, or condition, of the

[
طَافِلَةٌ, which Golius explains as meaning “ i. q.
فَايِدَةٌ et خَيْرٌ, utilitas, bonum,” referring to the
KL as his authority, is evidently a mistake for
طَائِلٌ, expl. as meaning فَائِدَةٌ and خَيْرٌ in my
copy of the KL, which does not mention طَافِلَةٌ
in any sense.]
أَطْفَلُ [More, or most, like to the طُفَيْلِىّ: and
hence, more, and most, intrusive, uninvited]. أَطْفَلُ
