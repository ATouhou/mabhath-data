تَطَامَنَ: see Q. Q. 2: and also Q. Q. 4, in
two places.
Q. Q. 1
طَأْمَنَ ظَهْرَهُ, (S, Msb, and so in some
copies of the K,) with ء, (Msb,) or ↓ طَامَنَهُ, (TA,
and so in some copies of the K,) without ء, for
the ء in اِطْمَأَنَّ [q. v. infrà] is [said to be] for the
purpose of preventing the combination of two
quiescent letters, (TA,) or طَامَنَهُ also, the former
being the original, (Msb,) He (a man, Msb) bent
down his back; (Msb, TA;) he lowered it;
(Msb;) and طَمْأَنَهُ signifies the same. (S, K.)
[And in like manner one says of other things.]
―
-b2-  And الشَّىْءَ ↓ طَامَنَ [or طَأْمَنَهُ], and طَمْأَنَهُ,
He caused the thing to be, or become, still, in a
state of rest, quiet, or calm. (TA.)
-A2-  And
مِنْهُ ↓ طَامَنَ [or طَأْمَنَ], (S,) or طَمْأَنَ منه, (K,
TA,) He (a man, S) was, or became, at rest from
it, (S, K,) namely, an affair, or event. (K.) [The
inf. n. of طأمن is طَأْمَنَةٌ, said in the TA to be syn.
with اِطْمِئْنَانٌ. See also Q. Q. 4.]
Q. Q. 2
تَطَأْمَنَ [more commonly written
↓ تَطَامَنَ, without ء, and ↓ اِطْمَأَنَّ also (see رَكَعَ)]
He stooped, [bent himself down,] or lowered himself; syn. تَطَأْطَأَ. (S and TA in art. طأ, &c.;
and R and TA in the present art.) ―
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  He
was, or became, lowly, humble, or submissive;
syn. خَضَعَ. (S and K in art. خضع, &c.: in
some copies of each written with, and in others
without, ء.) ―
-b3-  See also the next paragraph, in
two places.
Q. Q. 4
اِطْمَأَنَّ is said by some to be originally
[اِطْمَانَّ] like اِحْمَارَّ, (Msb,) as Esh-Shiháb states
in the Expos. of the Shifè, (TA,) and to be pronounced with ء for the purpose of avoiding [the
combination of] the two quiescent letters, (Msb,
TA,) anomalously: (Msb:) and some say that
it is originally اِطْأَمَنَّ, (Msb, TA,) because you
say طَأْمَنَ الرَّجُلُ ظَهْرَهُ, with ء, (Msb,) or, as Suh
says, in the R, because it is from تَطأْمَنَ, the م
being put before the ء in order to render the
word more easy of pronunciation, (TA,) therefore
it is anomalous; (Msb;) Sb [likewise] held it to
be formed by transposition, and derived from
طَأْمَنَ; but AA held the contrary to be the case.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  You say, اِطْمَأَنَّتِ الأَرْضُ, and ↓ تَطَامَنَت
[or ↓ تَطَأْمَنَت], meaning The land, or ground, was,
or became, low, or depressed. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See also
Q. Q. 2. ―
-b4-  اطمأنّ, (S, Mgh, K,) inf. n. اِطْمِئْنَانٌ
and طُمَأْنِينَةٌ, (S, K,) or the latter is a simple
subst., (Mgh, Msb,) signifies [also] He (a man,
S) was, or became, still, in a state of rest or ease,
quiet, or calm; syn. سَكَنَ; (S, Mgh;) as also
اِطْبَأَنَّ, which is formed by permutation. (S.)
And thus it signifies as said of the heart, i. e.
It was, or became, still, in a state of rest or
ease, quiet, calm, tranquil, unruffled, or free from
disquietude. (Msb.) Thus too in the saying,
اطمأن إِلَى كَذَا, i. e. (tropical:)  He trusted to such a
thing, or relied upon it, so as to become at rest
or ease, or quiet, in mind. (K, * TA.) And one
says also, اطمأنّ جَالِسًا [He became still, or at
rest, or at ease, sitting]: (TA:) and اطمأنّ بِنَا
الجُلُوسُ [lit. The sitting became still, or free from
disquiet, with us]; meaning اِسْتَقْرَرْنَا وَسَكَنَّا فِى
الجُلُوسِ [i. e. we became settled, or at rest or ease,
and still, in the sitting; or became seated at ease].
(Har p. 280.) And اطمأنّ بِالمَوْضِعِ [He settled
in the place; i. e.] he remained, stayed, abode,
or dwelt, in the place, and took it as his home.
(Msb.) And اطمأنّ عَمَّا كَانَ يَفْعَلُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [He became
at rest from that which he was doing;] i. e. he
desisted from that which he was doing. (TA.)
And ↓ فِيهِ تَطَامُنٌ [or ↓ تَطَأْمُنٌ] In him is quietness, calmness, or sedateness. (TA.)
طَمْنٌ: see مُطْمَئِنٌّ.
طُمَيْئِنٌ dim. of مُطْمَئِنٌّ; (S, K;) formed by
rejecting the م at the beginning, and one of the
two نs at the end, of the latter word. (S.)
طُمَأْنِينَةٌ an [irreg.] inf. n. of اِطْمَأَنَّ, (S, K,) or
a subst. therefrom; as such signifying [A depression in the ground; as, for instance, in the S and
K voce رَزْنٌ: (comp. مُطْمَأَنٌّ:) ―
-b2-  and also]
Stillness, a state of rest or ease, quietness, calmness, tranquillity, or freedom from disquietude.
(Mgh, Msb.)
طُمَيْئِينَةٌ dim. of طُمَأْنِينةٌ; formed by the rejection of one of the two نs in the latter word,
because it is augmentative. (S.)
مُطْمَأَنٌّ A place of depression or lowness in the
land or ground. (Mgh. [See also the following
paragraph.])
-A2-  مُطْمَأَنٌّ إِلَيْهِ (tropical:)  A thing to which
one trusts, or upon which one relies, so as to
become at rest or ease, or quiet, in mind. (S, K, *
TA.)
مُطْمَئِنٌّ A place low, or depressed. (Mgh,
Msb.) ―
-b2-  And A man (S) still, in a state of
rest or ease, quiet, or calm; (S, Mgh, K;) as
also ↓ طَمْنٌ, (K,) but this is a word unused in
the [genuine] language, (TA,) pl. طُمُونٌ. (K.)
Hence one says, هُوَ مُطْمَئِنٌّ إِلَى كَذَا (tropical:)  He is
trusting to such a thing, or relying upon it, so as
to be at rest or ease, or quiet, in mind. (S, K, *
TA.) And [it is said that] النَّفْسُ المُطْمَئِنَّةُ
means (assumed tropical:)  The soul that has become at rest or ease,
quiet, or calm, by belief; and lowly, humble, or
submissive, to its Lord. (TA. [See the Kur
lxxxix. 27.]) ―
-b3-  Also Taking for oneself a place
in the earth, or in a country, as a home, or settled
place of abode. (TA.)
طيو and طيى
1
طَيَا, aor. يَطْيُو, inf. n. طُيُوٌّ; and طَيَى, aor.
يَطْمِى, (S, K,) inf. n. طُمِىٌّ, (S,) thus in the
M [as well as in the S], or طَمْىٌ, thus in the K
and in the book of ISk; (TA;) said of water,
(S, K,) It became high, (K,) or it rose high, and
filled the channel in which it flowed. (S.) [See
also طَمَّ.] ―
-b2-  And, both verbs, said of a plant,
It became tall. (K.) ―
-b3-  Also, (K, TA,) said of
the sea, and of a river, and of a well, (TA,) It
became full: (K, TA:) so says Lth. (TA.) ―
-b4-
And طَمَتْ بِزَوْجِهَا (tropical:)  She (a woman) exalted herself with her husband; syn. اِرْتَفَعَتْ بِهِ; (S, TA;)
from طَمَا or طَمَى said of water: (S:) or she
grinned at her husband. (Z, TA.) ―
-b5-  طَمَتْ بِهِ
هِمَّتُهُ, aor.
1َ2ُ3َ and
1َ2ِ3َ as above, (assumed tropical:)  His ambition
elevated him. (K, * TA.) ―
-b6-  And طَمَا بِهِ said
of anxiety, and of grief, and of fear, (assumed tropical:)  It became
vehement in him: the following verse by himself
is quoted by Z:
قَدْ طَمَا بِى خَوْفُ المَنِيَّةِ لٰكِنْ
↓ خَوْفُ مَا يَعْقُبُ المَنِيَّةَ أَطْمَى
[(assumed tropical:)  The fear of death has become vehement in me,
but the fear of what will follow death is more
vehement.] (TA.) ―
-b7-  And طَمَى, aor. يَطْمِى,
like طَمَّ, aor. يَطِمُّ, signifies He passed by, or
along, hastening, or going quickly: (S, TA:) and
hence, طَمَا [or طَمَى], said of a horse, He hastened, or went quickly. (TA.)
[
طَمَايَةٌ is said by Golius, as on the authority
of Z, to signify Solicitude, and fear: but probably, I think, from his having found طَيَايَةٌ هَمٌّ
وَخَوْفٌ erroneously written for طَمَا بِهِ هَمٌّ وَخَوْفٌ,
meaning “ fear became vehement in him. ”]
مَآءٌ طَامٍ Water rising high, and filling its
channel. (S.) And بَحْرٌ طَامٍ A [high or] copious
sea. (TA.)
أَطْمَى [More, and most, vehement]: see the
verse cited above.
