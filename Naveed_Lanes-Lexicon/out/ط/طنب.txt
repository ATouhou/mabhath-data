fast: (Msb:) a rope of the خِبَآء (S, O, L, TA)
and of the سُرَادِق [q. v.] and the like: (L, TA:)
a long rope with which the سرادق of the tent is
tied, or made fast; (A, K, TA;) or, as in the
M, with which the tent and the سرادق are tied,
or made fast, [extending] between the ground and
the طَرَائِق [pl. of طَرِيقَةٌ, q. v.]: (TA:) and also
a وَتِد [app. meaning a tent-peg]; thus in the K,
and the like is said in the M; those who make
الوَتِدُ in the K to be conjoined with سرادق [as
though the author meant that طنب signifies a
long rope with which the سرادق of the tent, and
the peg, are tied, or made fast,] being in error:
(TA: [but in my opinion, this reading which is
disallowed in the TA is more probably correct
than the other: in the CK, and in my MS. copy
of the K, instead of وَالوَتِدُ, we find او الوتد: in a
copy of the A, او الوَتِرُ, an obvious mistranscription:]) the pl. is أَطْنَابٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and
طِنَبَةٌ; (K;) and some of the lexicologists assert
that طُنُبٌ is used as a sing. like عُنُقٌ, and as a
pl. like كُتُبٌ; (MF, TA;) and Ibn-es-Sarráj
says, in one place of his book, that it has no
other pl. than أَطْنَابٌ; but in another place he
says that it has this pl. accord. to those who give
it a pl., thus giving to understand that there is a
difference of opinion as to the plural's being
allowable, and that it is used in one form as
sing. and pl., which is the case: (Msb, TA:)
the أَطْنَاب are the أَوَاخِىّ [pl. of آخِيَّةٌ], i. e. the
long ropes of the أَخْبِيَة [pl. of خِبَآء]; the short
ropes being called أُصُرٌ, sing. إِصَارٌ: the former are
the ropes with which the tent is tied, or made fast,
between the ground and the طَرَائِق. (TA.) As
an instance of a tropical usage, (A, TA,) it is
related that when El-Ash'ath contracted marriage
with a woman, (A, Nh, O, Msb, L,) namely,
Meleekeh Bint-Zurárah, (Nh, Msb, L,) on the
terms upon which she should decide, (A, Nh, O,
&c.,) and she decided upon a hundred thousand
dirhems, (A, Nh, Msb, L,) رَدَّهَا عُمَرُ إِلَى أَطْنَابِ
بَيْتِهَا, meaning (tropical:)  ' Omar reduced her to the dowry
of the like of her among the women of her family;
(A, Nh, O, Msb, L;) [lit., to the ropes of her
tent, or to the tent-ropes of her family;] i. e., to
the ground whereon was built the condition of
her family, and over which their tent-ropes extended. (Nh, L.) And another tropical usage
occurs in the saying, مَا بَيْنَ طُنُبَىِ المَدِينَةِ أَحْوَجُ
مِنِّى إِلَيْهَا, (TA,) a saying ascribed to the Prophet,
