طَبڤقَ [طَبَقَهُ, aor.
طَبِقَ, accord. to Freytag, is expl.
in the K as syn. with أَطْبَقَهُ in the first of the

طبّق السَّحَابُ الجَوَّ The clouds covered the mid-air

And طبّق الشَّىْءُ, inf. n. as above, i. q. عَمَّ [The

a person bowing himself in prayer, طبّق, and
likewise ↓ اطبق, (TA,) or طبّق كَفَّيْهِ, (Mgh,)
or طبّق بَيْنَ كَفَّيْهِ ثُمَّ وَضَعَهُمَا بَيْنَ فَخِذَيْهِ, (O,)
He put his hands [together, palm to palm, ana
then put them] between his thighs. (Mgh.) The

mode of judicial decision: (O, TA:) and the text

3
مُطَابَقَةٌ signifies The putting a thing upon,

therewith: whence the phrase, طَابَقْتُ النَّعْلَ [i. e.,

one says also, طَابَقْتُ بَيْنَ الشَّيْئَيْنِ I made the two

[And the like is said in several other arts. in
other lexicons.]) And اطبقتُ الرَّحَى I put the
upper mill-stone upon the lower. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See
also 2, second sentence. [This last ex. shows
that اطبقهُ signifies sometimes It covered it as
meaning it became a cover, or like a cover, to it;
and اطبق عَلَيْهِ likewise has this meaning; as also
عليه ↓ انطبق, and عليه ↓ تطبّق.] ―
-b3-  [Hence,]
one says, اطبق عَلَيْهِ الجُنُونُ (Msb, TA) (assumed tropical:)  Insanity covered [i. e. veiled, or wholly obscured,]

[as though they were like a cover; or] as though

(TA.) ―
-b8-  [اطبقهُ عَلَيْهِ signifies He made it to
cover it; i. e., to be a cover, or like a cover, upon

مَا حَاذَاهُ مِنَ الحَنَكِ [He made to cover the part
of the tongue which was the place of utterance of
the letter what was opposite to it of the palate;
i. e. he put that part of his tongue close beneath

earth, I would not do such a thing]. (S, O.)

-b2-
[And It became closed; said of a door, &c. ―
-b3-

is impeded in his speech, unable to speak, or

says of a rule, يَنْطَبِقُ عَلَى كَذَا وَكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  It
applies to such and such things or subjects.]

-b4-  طِبْقٌ signifies
also A space, or period, (سَاعَةٌ,) of the day; and
so ↓ طِبْقَةٌ: and ↓ طَبِيقٌ signifies the same of the
night: (K:) you say, أَقَمْتُ عِنْدَهُ طِبْقًا مِنَ النَّهَارِ,
and ↓ طِبْقَةً, I remained at his abode during a
space, or period, (سَاعَةً,) of the day: (Ibn-'Abbád,

-A3-  Also A road, or way:
-A4-  and i. q. دَسْتُور [as a Pers. word, generally
meaning Permission, or leave, as expl. by Golius
in this instance]. (KL. [But for these two
significations I have not found any other authority.])
طَبَقٌ A thing that is the equal of another thing
(Msb, K) of any kind (K) in its measure so that
it covers the whole extent of the latter like the
lid: this is its primary signification: (Msb:)
[whence] one says, هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ طَبَقُ هٰذَا, like طِبْقُهُ,

cover, or lid, (Mgh, K,) of a jar, (Mgh,) or of

طِبَاقٌ, mentioned in the Msb as a pl. of طَبَقٌ in
another, but similar, sense, which will be found
in what follows, but better known as a pl. of
طَبَقَةٌ], and أَطْبِقَةٌ is added as another pl. in the K,
but [SM says] this is strange; I have not found
it in the [other] lexicons; and it may be that the
right reading is وَأَطْبَقَهُ, as syn. with what immediately there follows it, i. e. وَطَبَّقَهُ. (TA.)
وَافَقَ شَنٌّ طَبَقَهْ is [a prov.] expl. (O, K, TA) by
As (O, TA) as said of a company of men who
had a receptacle of skin [i. e. a water-skin] that
had become old and worn out, wherefore they
made a طَبَق [or cover] for it: (O, K, TA:) [so
that the meaning is, A water-skin that had become old and worn out suited its cover:] or شَنٌّ
and طَبَقٌ [in the O طبقه] were two tribes; (S, *
O, K * TA;) and, as ISd says, شَنٌّ does not
here mean a water-skin, for this has no طَبَق:
(TA:) or [طَبَقَهٌ is for طَبَقَةَ, and] طَبَقَةُ was an
intelligent woman, whom an intelligent man took
as his wife. (O, K, TA. [See Freytag's Arab.
Prov., ii. 800.]) ―

utensil; (Msb;) [i. e. a dish, or plate; perhaps
thus called because the cover of a cooking-vessel

and the thing upon which fruit is placed [i. e. a

horse [&c.]: pl. أَطْبَاقٌ: (Kr:) and some say, the
vertebræ altogether: and some say, a vertebra, in
any part. (TA.) It is said in a trad. respecting
the day of resurrection, تَبْقَى أَصْلَابُ المُنَافِقِينَ
طَبَقًا وَاحِدًا, meaning [The backbones of the hypocrites shall be (lit. continue to be) as though
they were] one vertebra: or, as some say,

coll. gen. n.]. (O. [See also 1 in art. عقم.]) ―

stages of Hell [whereof every one except the
lowest is imagined to be like a cover over
another]. (TA.) [And in like manner, Any of
the Seven Heavens:] one says, السَّمٰوَاتُ طِبَاقٌ,
meaning The Heavens are [composed of stages]
one above another; (S, O, Msb; *) every heaven
[except the lowest] being like a طبق to another:
(Msb:) or this is said because of their being conformable, one with another: (K:) and it is said
in the Kur lxvii. 3, اَلَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمٰوَاتٍ طِبَاقًا,
meaning [Who hath created seven heavens] placed
one above another; طباقا being the inf. n. of
طَابَقْتُ النَّعْلَ [q. v.], used as an epithet; or for
طُوبِقَتْ طِبَاقًا; or ذَاتَ طِبَاقٍ, pl. of طَبَقٌ or of

A generation of mankind; or the people of one
time; syn. قَرْنٌ and عَالَمٌ; as in the saying of El-
'Abbás,
إِذَا مَضَى عَالَمٌ بَدَا طَبَقُ
[metre مُنْسَرِح] i. e. إِذَا مَضَى قَرْنٌ بَدَا قَرْنٌ [When
a generation passes away, a generation appears
in its place]: the قَرْن being called طَبَق because
they are a طَبَق [i. e. cover] to the earth: then
they pass away and another طَبق comes: (O,
TA:) or, as IAar says, طَبَقٌ signifies a people
after a people. (TA.) And (TA) A قَرْن [i. e.
generation] of time: or twenty years: (K, TA:)
or, as in the book of El-Hejeree, on the authority
of I'Ab, ↓ طَبَقَةٌ has this latter meaning. (TA.)
―
-b15-  (tropical:)  A rain such as fills and covers the earth, or

land became, or became in the morning,] covered
with water over its surface. (TA.) ―
-b16-  A main
portion of the night and of the day: (S, O, K:)

night and of the day]. (TA.) See also طِبْقٌ. ―
-b17-
And A state, or condition; (S, O, K, TA;) as
also ↓ طَبَقَةٌ, of which the pl. is طِبَاقٌ: the pl. of
the former in this sense is أَطْبَاقٌ. (TA.) Hence
the phrase, لَتَرْكَبُنَّ طَبَقًا عَنْ طَبَقٍ, (S, O, K, TA,)
in the Kur [lxxxiv. 19], meaning [Ye shall
assuredly enter upon] state after state, (S, * O,
TA,) and predicament after predicament; as in
the A; (TA;) on the day of resurrection; (S;)
the state being termed طَبَق because it will fill the
hearts [as though the dread thereof covered them],
or will be near to doing so; (O, TA;) and عَنْ
being put in this instance, as it is in many others,
in the place of بَعْدَ: (TA:) or the meaning is,
one after another of similar states of hardship:
or it may be, degrees of hardship after degrees
thereof; طَبَقٌ accord. to this rendering being
regarded as pl. [or coll. gen. n.] of ↓ طَبَقَةٌ:
(Ksh and Bd:) or [ye shall assuredly mount
upon] the heaven in one state after another state;
for it (the heaven) shall be like مُهْل [i. e. molten
brass or iron &c., as is said in the Kur lxx. 8,] and
then successively in other states: (O, TA:) so
says Aboo-Bekr: accord. to Er-Rághib, it points
to the various successive states of man in the
present world from his creation, and in the world
to come until his resting in one of the two abodes
[Paradise or Hell]: or, accord. to Ibn-Abi-l-
Hadeed, it means [ye shall assuredly enter upon]
difficulty after difficulty; as is related by MF;
and the same is said by Az on the authority of
I'Ab: (TA:) some read لَتَرْكَبَنَّ, meaning thou,
O Mohammad, shalt assuredly mount upon stage
after stage of the stages (أَطْبَاق) of heaven; and
I'Ab and Ibn-Mes-ood read لَتَرْكَبِنَّ, with kesr
to the ب, which is accord. to the dial. of Temeem,
and Keys and Asad and Rabee'ah pronounce the
first letter of the future with kesr except when it
is ى: 'Omar read لَيَرْكَبَنَّ, either as relating to
the Prophet or as referring to him who is mentioned in verses 10-15 of the same chapter. (O,
TA.) One says also, بَاتَ يَرْعَى طَبَقَ النُّجُومِ,
meaning (tropical:)  [He passed the night watching] the
state of the stars in their course: (TA:) or طَبَقُ
النُّجُومِ means the falling [or app. setting] of stars
after [other] stars: or, accord. to Es-Sadoosee,
the rising of a star and the setting of another:

-b19-  [The pl.] الأَطْبَاقُ also signifies Those
who are remote, and those who are remotely connected: so in a trad. respecting the signs of the

is said, يُوْصَلُ الأَطْبَاقُ وَيُقْطَعُ الأَرْحَامُ [Those who
are remote, and those who are remotely related,
shall be brought into close connection, and the ties
of relationship shall be severed]. (TA.) ―
-b20-  بِنْتُ
طَبَقٍ is an appellation of A female tortoise, [app.
because of the cover of her back,] which, (S, O,
K,) as the Arabs assert, (S, O,) lays ninety-nine
eggs, all of them [eventually] tortoises, and lays
one egg which discloses (S, O, K) a serpent (K)
[or a serpent such as is termed] an أَسْوَد; (S, O;)
or, accord. to Az, sixty-nine [eggs], and the seventieth is [eventually] a viper. (So in a marg. note
in one of my copies of the S; in which, also, the
appellation is written بِنْتُ طَبَقَ, instead of بِنْتُ
طَبَقٍ.) Hence the phrase إِحْدَى بَنَاتِ طَبَقٍ,
meaning (tropical:)  A calamity; (S, O, TA;) as also
بِنْتُ طَبَقٍ: (TA:) بَنَاتُ طَبَقٍ meaning calamities
[like مُطْبِقَاتٌ]: as well as tortoises: and serpents: (K:) and أُمُّ طَبَقٍ [in like manner] means
calamity: (TA in art. طرق:) or, accord. to EthTha'álibee, طَبَقُ [thus, imperfectly decl., as
written in the L,) signifies a yellow serpent:
(L, TA:) and أُمُّ طَبَقٍ and بِنْتُ طَبَقٍ are said to
signify the serpent, because of its coiling itself
round: or بَنَاتُ طَبَقٍ is an appellation applied
to serpents because of their winding themselves
round (لإِطْبَاقِهَا) upon him whom they bite; or,
as some say, because the حَوَّآء [q. v.] confines
them beneath the lids (أَطْبَاق) of the baskets
(أَسْفَاط) covered with leather; or, as Z says,
because they resemble the طَبَق [i. e. cover, or
dish, or plate,] when they coil themselves round.
