طباهجطَبَاهَجٌ, (so in some copies of the K, and so in
the S voce كَبَابٌ,) or طَبَاهَجَةٌ, (so in other copies
of the K,) with fet-h to the ط and the ه, (TA,)
[the latter app. a n. un.,] Flesh-meat cut into thin
slices and broiled: (K, * TA:) or a food composed
of flesh-meat and eggs: (MA; in which the word
is written طَبَاهِجَة:) [or, accord. to Golius, as on
the authority of J and El-Haleemee, a food of
pieces of flesh-meat, eggs, onion, and water: but
I do not find that J has explained it otherwise
than by what here follows:] i. q. كَبَابٌ: (S voce
كَبَابٌ:) or a kind of fry of flesh-meat: (L:)
arabicized from [the Pers.] تَبَاهَهْ. (K.) [See
also De Sacy's Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed. i. 175.]
