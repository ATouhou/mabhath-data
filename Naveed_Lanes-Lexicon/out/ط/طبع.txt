طبع1
طَبَعَ, aor.
طَبَعَ, inf. n. طَبْعٌ, He sealed, stamped,
imprinted, or impressed; syn. خَتَمَ: (Msb:)
[and, as now used, he printed a book or the
like:] تَبْعٌ and خَتْمٌ both signify the making an
impression in, or upon, clay and the like: (S,
Mgh, O, K:) or, as Er-Rághib says, the impressing a thing with the engraving of the signet and
stamp: (TA in this art. and in art. ختم: [see
more in the first paragraph of the latter art:])
and he says also that طَبْعٌ signifies the figuring a
thing with some particular figure; as in the case
of the طَبْع of the die for stamping coins, and the
طَبْع of coins [themselves]: but that it is more
general in signification than خَتْمٌ, and more
particular than نَقْشٌ; as will be shown by what
follows: accord. to Aboo-Is-hák the Grammarian, طَبْعٌ and خَتْمٌ both signify the covering
over a thing, and securing oneself from a thing's
entering it: and IAth says [in like manner] that
they held طَبْعٌ to be syn. with رَيْنٌ [inf. n. of
رَانَ]: but Mujáhid says that رَيْنٌ denotes less
than طَبْعٌ; and طَبْعٌ, less than إِقْفَالٌ [or the
“ closing with a lock: ” this he says with reference to a phrase in the Kur xlvii. 26]. (TA.)
You say, طَبَعَ الكِتَابَ, (Mgh, Msb,) and طَبَعَ عَلَى
الكِتَابِ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *) He sealed (خَتَمَ, S,
Mgh, Msb, K,) the writing, or letter. (S, Mgh,
Msb.) And طَبَعَ He branded, or otherwise
marked, the sheep, or goat. (O. [See طَابَعٌ.])
And طَبَعَ اللّٰهُ عَلَى قَلْبِهِ (tropical:)  God sealed [or set a seal
upon] his [i. e. an unbeliever's] heart, so that he
should not heed admonition, nor be disposed to
that which is good; (Mgh;) or so that belief
should not enter it: (O:) [and in like manner,
خَتَمَ عَلَيْهِ, q. v.:] in this, regard is had to the
طَبْع, and the طَبِيعَة, which is the natural constitution or disposition; for it denotes the characterizing of the soul with some particular quality or
qualities, either by creation or by habit, and
more especially by creation. (Er-Rághib, TA.)
―
-b2-  Also He began to make, or manufacture, a
thing: and he made [a thing] as in instances here
following. (Mgh.) You say, طَبَعَ مِنَ الطِّينِ
جَرَّةً He made, [or fashioned, or moulded,] of the
clay, a jar. (S, O, K.) And طَبَعَ اللَّبِنَ, (Mgh,
TA,) and السَّيْفَ, (S, Mgh, O, K,) and الدِّرْهَمُ,
(S, O, K,) He made (S, Mgh, O, K) [the crude
bricks, and the sword, and the dirhem]: or طَبَعَ
الدَّرَاهِمَ he struck (Mgh, Msb) with the die (Msb)
[i. e. coined, or minted,] the dirhems, or money.
(Mgh, Msb.) And [hence] one says, طَبَقَهُ اللّٰهُ
عَلَى الأَمْرِ, aor. and inf. n. as above, (assumed tropical:)  God
created him with an adaptation, or a disposition,
to the thing, affair, state, condition, or case; or
adapted him, or disposed him, by creation, [or
nature], thereto. (TA.) And طُبِعَ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ
(assumed tropical:)  He (a man, O, TA) was created with an adaptation, or a disposition, to the thing; or was
adapted, or disposed, by creation [or nature],
thereto; syn. جُبِلَ, (IDrd, O, K, TA,) or فُطِرَ.
(Lh, TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, (aor. as above, TA, and so
the inf. n., O, TA,) He filled (Er-Rághib, O, K,
TA) a measure for corn or the like, (Er-Rághib,
TA,) or a leathern bucket, (O, K, TA,) and a
skin, (O, TA,) &c.; (O;) and so ↓ طبّع, (S,
O, K,) inf. n. تَطْبِيعٌ: (S, O:) because the
quantity that fills it is a sign that prevents the
taking a portion of what is in it [without the
act's being discovered]. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―
-b4-
And طَبَعَ قَفَاهُ, (IAar, O, K,) inf. n. as above,
(IAar, O,) He struck the back of his neck with
his hand; (IAar, O, K;) i. e. the back of the neck
of a boy: if with the ends of the fingers, one
says, قَذَّ قَفَاهُ. (IAar, O.) ―

means I know not whence he came forth; syn.
طَلَعَ. (TA.)

طَبَعَ,] inf. n. طَبَعٌ, said
of a sword, It was, or became, rusty, or overspread with rust: (S:) or very rusty, or overspread with much rust. (K, TA: from an explanation of the aor.: but this is written in the CK
and in my MS. copy of the K, and in the O,
يُطْبَعُ. [An explanation of طَبَعٌ in the O and K
confirms the reading يَطْبَعُ; and another confirmation thereof will be found in what follows in this
paragraph.]) ―
-b2-  Said of a thing, (Msb,) or of a
garment, or piece of cloth, (TA,) inf. n. طَبَعٌ, It
was, or became, dirty; (Msb, TA;) and ↓ تطّبع
is likewise said [in the same sense] of a garment,
or piece of cloth. (M and TA voce رَانَ, in art.
رين.) ―
-b3-  Said of a man, (assumed tropical:)  He was or became,
filthy or foul [in character]. (S.) And (assumed tropical:)  He
was, or became, sluggish, lazy, or indolent. (S.)
One says of a man, يَطْبَعُ, (O, K,) like يَفْرَحُ,
(K,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  He has no penetrative energy,
sharpness, or effectiveness, in the affairs that are
the means, or causes, of attaining honour, like the
sword that is overspread with much rust. (O, K.)
-A3-  طُبِعَ, (O, K,) inf. n. طَبْعٌ, (O,) said of a man,
(assumed tropical:)  He was rendered [or pronounced] filthy or foul
[in character]; (O, K;) on the authority of Sh;

and disgraced, or dishonoured: (K:) and ↓ طُبِّعَ,
(O, TA,) inf. n. تَطْبِيعٌ, (TA,) he was rendered
[or pronounced] filthy or foul [in character], (O,
TA,) and blamed, or discommended. (O.)
2
طبّع, inf. n. تَطْبِيعٌ, He sealed well [or much,
or he sealed a number of writings &c.]. (KL: in
which only the inf. n. is mentioned.) ―
-b2-  And He

-b3-  See
also 1, a little after the middle.
-A2-  تَطْبِيعٌ signifies
also The rendering unclean, dirty, filthy, or
impure. (O, K.) ―
-b2-  See 1, last sentence.

natural disposition. (Har p. 236.) You say,
تطبّع بِطِبَاعِهِ (tropical:)  He affected, or feigned, his [i. e.
another's] natural dispositions. (O, K, TA.) ―

It (a river, or rivulet,) overflowed its sides with
the water, and poured it forth abundantly. (TA.)
―
-b3-  See also 1, last quarter.
7
يَذُوبُ وَيَنْطَبِعُ, a phrase of Es-Sarakhsee,
meaning [It melts, and then] it admits of being
sealed, stamped, imprinted, or impressed, is allowable on the ground of analogy, though we have
not heard it [as transmitted from the Arabs of
pure speech]. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  [Golius has erroneously
expl. انطبع as meaning “ Mansuetus, edoctus,
obsequens fuit; ” on the authority of the KL;
evidently in consequence of his having found its
inf. n. (اِنْطِبَاعٌ) written in a copy of that work for
اِنْطِياعٌ, the reading in my own copy.]
8

being meant such as straitness and ampleness [of

لَا خَيْرَ فِى طَمَعٍ يَهْدِى إِلَى طَبَعٍ
وَغُفَّةٌ مِنْ قِوَامِ العَيْشِ تَكْفِينِى

الطَّبَائِعُ الأَرْبَعُ The four humours of the body: see
خِلْطٌ and مِزَاجٌ.]

the brand or other mark,] of the فَرَائِض [or beasts
