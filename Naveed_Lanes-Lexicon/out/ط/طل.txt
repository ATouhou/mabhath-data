طل1
طَلَّتِ السَّمَآءُ الأَرْضَ, [aor.
طَلُ3َ,] inf. n. طَلٌّ,
The sky rained small rain upon the earth, or land.
(MA.) And طُلَّتِ الأَرْضُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. as
above, (TA,) [meaning, as is implied in the S
and O, The earth, or land, was rained upon by the
weakest of rain; or was rained upon, or bedewed,
by the طَلّ, q. v.; or] the طَلّ descended upon the
earth, or land: (K:) and طَلَّهَا النَّدَى [The rain,
or dew, moistened it]: (S, O, TA:) and طَلَّت,
with fet-h, signifies [accord. to some] It became
moist, or moistened: one says, طُلَّتْ بِلَادُكَ, and
طَلَّتْ; the former meaning May thy countries,
or tracts of country, be rained upon; and the
latter, become moist, or moistened: or, accord. to
Aboo-Is-hák, [i. e. Zj,] طُلَّتْ only, with damm;
[and he adds,] one says, رَحُبَتْ بِلَادُكَ وَطُلَّتْ, with
damm, [i. e. May thy tracts of country be spacious
to thee, and be moistened by the طَلّ, (or, as in
art. رحب in the TA, أَرْحَبَتْ عَلَيْكَ وَطُلَّتْ)], not
طَلَّتْ; because the طَلّ is not from them, [i. e.
it is not from the tracts of country,] but they are
the objects thereof. (TA.) [Golius mentions,
among the significations of طَلَّ, as on the
authority of Z, i. q. رحب, said of land, or the
earth, and followed by على relating to a person:
but I think it most probable that he inferred this
signification from his finding, in a copy of the A,
the phrase رَحُبَتْ عَلَيْكَ الأَرْصُ وَطَلَّتْ (for وَطُلَّتْ),
without any explanation. And Freytag mentions
↓ أُطِلَّ as meaning It was watered by fine rain;
from the Deewán of the Hudhalees.] And [it is
said that] طَلَّتِ السَّمَآءُ signifies اِشْتَدَّ وَقْعُهَا [i. e.
The rain fell vehemently]. (TA.)
-A2-  طَلَّ دَمَهُ,

(K,) He made his blood to go for nought, unretaliated, and uncompensated by a mulct; made it
to be of no account: (AZ, S, O, Msb, K, TA:)
or held it to be of little account, as though it were
but [the rain, or dew, termed] طَلّ, in its result;
this, accord. to Er-Rághib, being the proper
meaning: (TA:) and ↓ اطلّهُ signifies the same.
(AZ, S, O, Msb, K.) And طُلَّ دَمُهُ His blood
was made to go for nought, &c.; (AZ, S, Mgh,
O, Msb, K;) as also دَمُهُ ↓ أُطِلَّ: (AZ, S, O,

fet-h, accord. to Ks and AO, (S, O, Msb,) aor.

analogy]; (K;) and طَلَّ, originally طَلِلَ, (Msb,
K, *) aor.
طَلَ3َ; (Msb, K;) [his blood went for
nought, &c.;] but this is disallowed by AZ; (S,
O, Msb;) and it is more commonly with damm.
(K.) ―
-b2-  And طَلَّهُ حَقَّهُ, aor.
طَلُ3َ, He diminished,
or impaired, to him his right, or due; or deprived,
or defrauded him of it, partly, or wholly: (K,
TA:) or, accord. to Khálid Ibn-Jembeh, (TA,)
he denied him, or refused him, his right, or due; (K,
TA;) and withheld it [from him]: (TA:) and he
annulled it; or made it to go for nought, as a
thing of no account, or as a thing that had perished
or become lost. (K, TA.) You say, طَلُّوا فُلَانًا
حَقَّهُ, aor.
طَلُ3َ, inf. n. طَلٌّ, They denied, or refused,
such a one his right, or due: so says Khálid Ibn-Jembeh. (O.) ―

(TA,) inf. n. طَلٌّ, (O, K,) He delayed, or deferred,

by إِلَيْهِ; and so, accord. to him, ↓ استطلّ, followed
by لَهُ;] He, or it, was, or became, pleasing, (K,
TA,) and goodly. (TA.)
-A4-  And طَلَّهُ, (K,)
inf. n. طَلٌّ, (TA,) is also syn. with طَلَاهُ: (K:)
so in the phrase طَلَّهُ بِالوَرْسِ [He smeared it, or
rubbed it over, with ورس, q. v.]; namely, a
thing. (Ibn-'Abbád, O.)

-A3-  اطلّ عَلَيْهِ He (a man,

عَلَيْهِمْ [And a Jew looked upon us, and I arose,
and smote off his head with the sword, then cast
it upon them]. (O.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, perhaps,] اطلّ

5
هٰذِهِ الأَرْضُ قَدْ تَطَلَّلَتْ This land has produced herbage, and become replete, [for تَخَيَّرَتْ

be the only instance of the kind that has been
heard except حِرَفٌ pl. of حَرْفٌ as meaning the
حَرْف of a mountain; (O;) [or] طَلَلٌ is a contraction of طِلَالٌ: in a saying of a poet, cited by
