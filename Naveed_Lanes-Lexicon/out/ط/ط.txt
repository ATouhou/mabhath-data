طalphabetical letter
ط
The sixteenth letter of the alphabet; called طَآءٌ
[and طَا]; the ا of which is reduced to ى [as its
radical letter]: when you spell it, you make its
final letter quiescent; but when you apply an
epithet to it, and make it a noun, you decline it
as a noun, saying, [for instance,] هٰذِهِ طَآءٌ طَوِيلَةٌ
[This is a tall ط]: it is one of the letters termed
مَجْهُورَة [or vocal, i. e. pronounced with the voice,
and not with the breath only]; and of the letters
termed نِطْعِيَّة, like ت and د, because originating
from the نِطْع [q. v.] of the roof of the mouth.
(TA.) It is substituted for the ت in the measure
اِفْتَعَلَ and the forms inflected therefrom, and
[sometimes] for the pronominal ت, when immediately following any of the palatal letters [ص
and ض and ط and ظ]; (MF, TA;) as in
[اِصْطَبَرَ and اِضْطَرَبَ and اِطَّبَعَ and اِظْطَلَمَ, for
اِصْتَبَرَ and اِضْتَرَبَ and إِطْتَبَعَ and اِظْتَلَمَ; and in]
فَحَصْطُ and حِضْطُ and خَبَطُّ and حَفِظْطُ, for
فَحَصْتُ and حِضْتُ and خَبَطْتُ and حَفِظْتُ; but
some of the grammarians say that this [latter]
substitution is not to be made invariably; [nor is
it common;] and it is said to be a dialectal
peculiarity of some of the Benoo-Temeem.
(TA.) It is also substituted for د: thus Yaakoob
mentions, on the authority of As, مَطَّ الحُرُوفَ,
for مَدَّ الحُرُوفَ: and AO, المَبْطَأُ, for المَبْدَأُ: and
Aboo-'Amr Ez-Záhid, in the Yawákeet, مَا أَبْعَدَ
طَارَكَ, for مَا أَبْعَدَ دَارَكَ. (TA.)
-A2-  [As a numeral,
it denotes Nine.]
