طَالَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) said by some to be of
the class of قَرُبَ, being made by them to accord
in from with its contr., which is قَصُرَ, and by
others said to be of the class of قَالَ, (Msb,) first
pers. طُلْتُ, [said to be] originally طَوُلْتُ, because
one says طَوِيلٌ, [not طَائِلٌ, when using it as an
intrans. v.,] (S, O,) aor. يَطُولُ, (TA,) inf. n.
طُولٌ, (S, * O, * Msb, K,) It (a thing, S, O, Msb)
was, or became, elongated, or extended; [i. e. it
was, or became, long; and it was, or became, tall,
or high; which meanings are sometimes more
explicitly denoted in order to avoid ambiguity,
as when one says طَالَ عَلَى وَجْهِ الأَرْضِ it was, or
became, elongated, or extended, upon the surface
of the earth or ground; and طَالَ فِى السَّمَآءِ it was,
or became, elongated, or extended, towards (lit.
into) the sky;] (S, O, Msb, K;) and ↓ استطال
signifies the same. (S, O, K.) It is also said of
any time that is extended; and of anxiety that
cleaves to one continually; and the like: [see
طُولٌ, below:] thus one says طَالَ اللَّيْلُ [The
night became long, or protracted]: (TA:) [and thus
طَالَ عَلَيْهِمُ الأَمَدُ, in the Kur lvii. 15, means The
time became extended, or prolonged, unto them:]
and عَلَيْهِمُ العُمُرُ ↓ تَطَاوَلَ, in the Kur xxviii. 45,
means, in like manner, [Life was prolonged unto
them; or] their lives became long, or prolonged:
(Jel:) and طال المَجْلِسُ The time of the assembly
was, or became, extended, or prolonged: (Msb:)
and طال الهَمُّ [Anxiety became protracted]. (TA.)
[One says also طَالَمَا فَعَلَ كَذَا Long time did he
thus; and the like; with the restrictive ما: see
Har p. 17.]
-A2-  When trans. [without a particle
it is of the class فَعَلَ; not فَعُلَ, because this is
not trans.: (TA:) one says طُلْتُهُ meaning I
exceeded him, or surpassed him, in الطُّول [i. e.
tallness; or I overtopped him]: and also in
الطَّوْل [i. e. beneficence, and excellence, &c.]. (S,
O, K.) See 3. A poet says,
إِنَّ الفَرَزْدَقَ صَخْرَةٌ عَارِيَةٌ
طَالَتْ فَلَيْسَ تَنَالُهَا الأَوْعَالُ
[Verily El-Farezdak is a bare rock that has
exceeded in height the mountain-goats so that the
mountain-goats do not reach it]: he means طَالَتِ
الأَوْعَالَ. (TA.) And it is said in a trad., فَطَالَ
العَبَّاسُ عُمَرَ i. e. And El-'Abbás exceeded 'Omar
in tallness of stature. (TA.) And you say, طَالَهُ
فِى الحَسَبِ [He excelled him in the grounds of
pretension to respect or honour]. (K and TA in
explanation of شَرَفَهُ: in the CK [erroneously]
طاوَلَهُ.)
-A3-  One says also, طال عَلَيْهِ, (S,) or
عَلَيْهِمْ, (Msb, K,) the verb in this case being of
the class of قَالَ, aor. يَطُولُ, (Msb,) inf. n. طَوْلٌ;
(S, * Msb;) and ↓ تطوّل; (S, Msb, K;) and
↓ اطال; (Msb;) He bestowed, or conferred, a
benefit or benefits, or a favour or favours, (S,
Msb, K,) upon him, (S,) or upon them. (Msb,
K.) And عَلَيْنَا بِشَىْءٍ ↓ تطوّل He gave to us a
thing; like تَنَوَّلَ; but the latter is said by Aboo-Mihjen to be used only in relation to good; and
the former, sometimes, in relation to good and
to evil. (TA in art. نول.)

طوّلهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَطْوِيلٌ; (O;)
and ↓ اطالهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) and ↓ أَطْوَلَهُ, (S, O,
K,) inf. n. إِطَالَةٌ; (O;) both signify the same;
(S, O, Msb, K;) He elongated it; extended it;
lengthened it; or made it long, or tall or high;
(S, * O, Msb;) syn. مَدَّهُ, (S, * O, * Msb,) and جَعَلَهُ
طَوِيلًا. (O, TA.) You say, طَوَّلْتُ الحَدِيدَةَ I
elongated, or lengthened, the piece of iron. (Msb.)
And اللّٰهُ بَقَآءَهُ ↓ اطال God extended, or prolonged,
his continuance [in life]; or may God extend, &c.
(Msb.) And المَجْلِسَ ↓ اطال He extended, or
prolonged, the time of the assembly. (Msb.) And
طوَّل لِلْفَرَسِ, (S, O,) or لِلدَّابَّةِ, (Msb, K,) He
slackened [or lengthened] (S, O, Msb, K) the
tether, (S, O, K,) or rope, (Msb,) of the horse,
(S, O,) or of the beast, (Msb, K,) in the place
of pasture, (S, O, K,) or that it might pasture
[more largely]: (Msb:) and لَهَا الطِّوَلَ ↓ اطال
and الطِّيَلَ [signify the same]. (TA, from a
trad.) And [hence] طوّل لَهُ (inf. n. as above, S)
He granted him a delay, or respite; (S, O,
Msb, K;) said of God: (S:) and فِى ↓ المُطَاوَلَةُ
الأَمْرِ means التَّطْوِيلُ فِيهِ; (Msb;) [i. e.] طاولهُ
signifies he delayed, or deferred, with him, (S, O,
K, TA,) فِى الأَمْرِ [in the affair], (S, O,) or فِى
الدَّيْنِ [in the case of the debt] and العِدَةِ [the
promise]. (TA.) [And طوّل عَلَيْهِ and ↓ تطوّل

طَاْوَلَ ↓ طَاوَلَنِى فَطُلْتُهُ He contended with me for
superiority (Ks, O, TA) in الطُّول [i. e. tallness],
and also in الطَّوْل [i. e. beneficence, and excellence,
&c.], and I exceeded him, or surpassed him, therein. (S, O, K.) بِكَ أُطَاوِلُ occurs in a prayer of
the Prophet, and is from الطَّوْلُ, meaning [By
means of Thee I contend for] superiority over the
enemies. (O.) One says also, طَاوَلَهُ بِالكِبَرِ وَقَالَ
أَنَا أَكْبَرُ مِنْكَ [He contended, or disputed, with him
for superiority in greatness, and said, I am greater
than thou]. (A in art. كبر.) [And المُطَاوَلَةُ فِى
الحُِظْوَةِ, occurring in the TA in art. سمو, means
The contending, or vying, or competing, for
superiority, in highness of rank.] ―

his toes, and stretched his stature, to look at a
thing: (TA:) or تَطَاوَلْتُ فِى قِيَامِى I stretched
my legs, in my standing, to look. (O.) One says,
يَتَطَاوَلُ لِلْأَفْنَانِ وَيَجْتَذِبُهَا بِالمِحْجَنِ [He stretches
himself up towards the branches, and draws them
to him with the hooked-headed stick]. (S in art.
حرق.) And it is said in a trad., تطاول عَلَيْهِمُ

superiority over him; (Az, TA;) [i. e. he behaved haughtily, arrogantly, overweeningly, overbearingly, domineeringly, or proudly, towards

(O:) and فِى عِرْضِ النَّاسِ ↓ الاِسْتِطَالَةُ occurs in a
trad. as meaning the contemning of men, and
exalting oneself above them, and reviling them,
vilifying them, or detracting from their reputation. (TA.) One says also تطاول بِمَا عِنْدَهُ He
exalted, or magnified, or boasted, himself in, or
he boasted of, what he possessed. (TA in art.
فتح.) And الفَحْلُ يَتَطَاوَلُ عَلَى إِبِلِهِ The stallion

other stallions from, his she-camels. (O.) ―

-b2-  Also It
extended and rose; (K, TA;) said of a crack [in
a wall]; like استطار: mentioned by Th. (TA.)
[And likewise said, in the same sense, of the
dawn, i. e., of the false dawn; in which case it
is opposed to استطار: see مُسْتَطِيلٌ.] ―
-b3-  See also
6, in four places.
-A2-  This verb is also used, by
Z and Bd, in a trans. sense; and استطالهُ, occurring in the “ Mufassal ” [of Z] is expl. as meaning عَدَّهُ طَوِيلًا [He reckoned it long, &c.]; and
in like manner it is used by Es-Saad in the
“ Mutowwal: ” but this usage is on the ground
of analogy [only]; for, accord. to the genuine
lexical usage, it is intransitive. (TA.)
طَوْلٌ [is originally an inf. n.: (see طَالَ عَلَيْهِ:)
and, used as a simple subst.,] signifies Beneficence;
and bounty: (S, TA:) and [a benefit, a favour,

or ascendancy. (O, TA.) One says, لِفُلَانٍ عَلَى
فُلَانٍ طَوْلٌ To such a one belongs excellence, or
superabundance, above such a one. (O. [And
the like is said in the Mgh.]) And it is said
in the Kur [iv. 29], وَمَنْ لَمْ يَسْتَطِعْ مِنْكُمْ طَوْلًا
أَنْ يَنْكِحَ المُحْصَنَاتِ, meaning And such of you
as is not able to obtain superabundance so that he
may marry the free women, let him marry a
female slave; (Mgh;) i. e. such as is not able
to give the dowry of the free woman, (Mgh, O,
TA,) as expl. by Zj. (Mgh, TA.) In the phrase
طَوْلُ الحُرَّةِ, the former word is originally the inf. n.
of the verb in طَالَ عَلَيْهَا meaning “ he benefited
her; ” because, when one is able to give the
dowry of the free woman, and pays it, he
benefits her: or, as some of the lawyers says,
this phrase means The superabundance of the
means of sustenance that suffices for the marrying
of the free woman, agreeably with a saying of
Az: or, as some say, طول means wealth, or
competence; and the phrase is originally طَوْلٌ
إِلَى الحُرَّةِ, i. e. ampleness of wealth such as
supplies the means of attaining to the free woman:
or originally طَوْلٌ عَلَى الحُرَّةِ, meaning power, or
ability, for the marrying of the free woman:
(Msb:) Esh-Shaabee is related to have used the
phrase الطَّوْلُ إِلَى الحُرَّةِ; and in like manner are
I'Ab and Jábir and Sa'eed Ibn-Jubeyr. (Mgh.)
ذِى الطَّوْلِ in the Kur xl. 3 means The Possessor
of all-sufficiency, and of superabundance, or of
bounty: (O:) or the Possessor of power: or of
bounty, and beneficence. (TA.) And أُولُو الطَّوْلِ
مِنْهُمْ in the Kur ix. 87 means Those, of them,
who are possessors of superabundance, and of
opulence. (Bd.) ―
-b3-  See also طِوَلٌ, latter half, in
two places.
طُولٌ [is originally an inf. n.: (see 1, first
sentence:) and, used as a simple subst.,] signifies
Length; and tallness, or height; contr. of عَرْضٌ;
(S, O, Msb;) or of قِصَرٌ: (M, TA:) pl. أَطْوَالٌ:
(Msb:) it is in man and other animals, and in
inanimate things: (TA:) in real things, or
substances; and also in ideal things, or attributes, as time and the like. (Er-Rághib, TA.)

-b2-  And The utmost extent of time.
(TA.) You say, لَا أُكَلِّمُهُ طُولَ الدَّهْرِ (S, O,

أَطْوَلُ [q. v.].
طِوَلٌ, for which ↓ طِوَلٌّ occurs in poetry, (S,
O, K,) and ↓ طِيَلٌ, for which also ↓ طِيَلٌّ occurs
in poetry, (K) and ↓ طَوِيلَةٌ, (Lth, O, K,) but
this is disapproved by Az, (TA,) and ↓ تِطْوَلٌ,
(K,) A tether; i. e. the rope that is extended for
a horse or similar beast, and attached to which he
pastures: (S, O:) a rope with which the leg of
such a beast is bound: (K:) a long rope thus
used: (TA:) or with which one binds him, holding its extremity, and letting the beast pasture:
(K, TA:) or of which one of the two ends is
bound to a stake, and the other to the fore leg of
a horse, in order that he may go round about
bound thereby, and pasture, and not go away at
random. (TA.) An ex. of the first of these
words occurs in a verse of Tarafeh cited voce
ثِنْىٌ. (S, O.) And it is said in a trad. that
when a man of an army alights in a place, he
may debar others from the extent of the طِوَل of
his horse. (TA.) ―
-b2-  أَرْخَى لَهُ الطِّوَلَ [lit. meaning
He relaxed, or slackened, to him the tether]

and ↓ طِيَلُكَ and ↓ طِيلُكَ and ↓ طُولُكَ and

K: [see also طِيلَةٌ:]) or thine absence: (S, K:)
or (tropical:)  thy tarrying, (A, K, TA,) and thy flagging
in an affair. (A, TA.) Tufeyl says,
أَتَانَا فَلَمْ نَدْفَعْهُ إِذْ جَآءَ طَارِقًا
فَانْزِلِ ↓ وَقُلْنَا لَهُ طَالَ طَوْلُكَ
meaning [He came to us, and we did not repel
him since he came as a nightly visiter, and we
said to him,] Thy case in respect of the length of
the journey and the endurance of travel [has been
long, therefore alight thou: or the right reading
may be ↓ طُولُكَ, which is better known]: or, as
some relate it, ↓ طِيلُكَ. (TA.) [It is also said
that] طِوَلٌ is a pl. [or rather a coll. gen. n.] of

↓ أَطْوَلُ is used in the sense of طَوِيلَةٌ, [being syn.
sometimes with طَوِيلٌ and طَوِيلَةٌ,] in a verse of
El-Farezdak cited voce عَزِيزٌ: (O, TA:) [it seems,
from a comparison of explanations of سُرْحُوبٌ
and سَلْهَبٌ &c. in the S and K, that طَوِيلٌ
applied to a horse or the like generally signifies
long-bodied:] طَوِيلٌ is the only epithet, known to
IJ, of the measure فَعِيلٌ having the ف and ل
sound and having و for its ع, except صَوِيبٌ and
قَوِيمٌ; for عَوِيصٌ is [held by him to be only] used
as a subst.: (M in art. صوب:) the pl. (of طَوِيلٌ
and طُوَالٌ, TA) is طِوَالٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and
طِيَالٌ; (S, O, K;) the latter anomalous, and
said by IJ to occur only in one verse: (TA:)
the fem. is طَوِيلَةٌ (Msb, K) and طُوَالَةٌ; (K, *
TA;) and the pl. of the former of these is
طَوِيلَاتٌ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  They said, إِنَّ اللَّيْلَ طَوِيلٌ
وَلَا يَطُلْ إِلَّا بِخَيْرٍ [Verily the night is long, and
may it not be long save with good fortune]:
mentioned by Lh, as expressing a prayer. (TA.)
And قَصِيرَةٌ مِنْ طَوِيلَةٍ [A short thing from a tall
thing]; meaning a date from a palm-tree: a
prov., alluding to the abridging of speech, or
language. (IAar, Meyd, K.) See also 4. ―

الطَّوِيلُ is also the name of A certain kind of
metre of verse; (S, O, K;) [namely, the first;]
consisting of فَعُولُنْ مَفَاعِيلُنْ eight [a mistake for
four] times: (O, TA:) so called because it is
the longest of all the metres of verse; originally
comprising forty-eight letters: (TA:) a postclassical term. (S, O, K.)
طَوِيلَةٌ as a subst.: see طِوَلٌ.
طُوَّلٌ A certain bird, (S, O, K,) of the aquatic
kind, having long legs. (O, K.)
طَيِّلَةُ الرِّيحِ The wind's counterwind. (S, O, K.)
طُوَّالٌ Very, or exceedingly, tall; (S, O, K,
TA;) applied to a man; as also, in the same
sense, ↓ طُوَالٌ, (TA,) the latter having a stronger
signification than طَوِيلٌ, [with which it is mentioned above as syn.,] (TA voce رَكِيكٌ,) or it
denotes less than طُوَّالٌ; (O in art. ظرف;) and
so ↓ طُولَانِىٌّ and ↓ مُطَاوِلٌ, in the dial. of the
vulgar: طُوَّالٌ has no broken pl., its pl. being
only طُوَّالُونَ: its fem. is with ة, and so is that of
طُوَالٌ; each applied to a woman. (TA.)
طَائِلٌ Benefiting; bestowing, or conferring, a
benefit or benefits, or a favour or favours. (Msb.)
―
-b2-  [Hence its usage in the following exs.] One
says of that which is vile, or contemptible, (Msb,
K, TA,) هُوَ غَيْرَ طَائِلٍ, (Msb,) or مَا هُوَ بِطَائِلٍ,
(K, TA,) [It is not good for anything; it is unprofitable, useless, or worthless]; and in this
manner it is used alike as masc. and fem. (TA.)
And it is said in a trad., ضَرَبْتُهُ بِسَيْفٍ غَيْرِ طَائِلٍ,
meaning I smote him with a sword that was not
sharp. (TA.) And in another trad., كُفِّنَ فِى كَفَنٍ
غَيْرِ طَائِلٍ i. e. [He was shrouded in grave-clothing]
not of delicate texture, and not of a goodly kind.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And [hence] it signifies [also] Benefit,
profit, utility, or avail; and excellence: thus in
the saying, هٰذَا أَمْرٌ لَا طَائِلَ فِيهِ [This is an affair
in which is no benefit, &c.]: (S, O, TA:) and
لَمْ يَحْلَ مِنْهُ بِطَائِلٍ [He did not find or experience,
or get or obtain, from it, or him, any benefit, &c.]:
it is only used in negative phrases [in this sense]:
(S, O, K, TA:) and [thus] one says also, نَطَقَ
بِمَا لَا طَائِلَ تَحْتَهُ [He spoke that in which was no
profit]. (TA in art. بوق.) See also طَوْلٌ,
second sentence.
طَائِلَةٌ: see طَوْلٌ, second sentence. ―
-b2-  Also
Enmity: and blood-revenge: (S, O, K, TA:) pl.
طَوَائِلُ. (TA.) You say, فُلَانٌ يَطْلُبُ بَنِى فُلَانٍ
بِطَائِلَةٍ i. e. Such a one seeks to obtain of the sons
of such a one blood-revenge. (TA.) [See also an
ex. in art. عقل, conj. 8.]
أَطْوَلُ Exceeding, or surpassing, in الطُّول [i. e.
length, and tallness or height]: (S, O, Msb, * K:)
and also in الطَّوْل [i. e. beneficence, and excellence,
&c.]: (S, O, K:) fem. طُولَى: (S, O, Msb, K:)
pl. of the former, applied to men, أَطَاوِلُ; (S, O;)
and of the latter طُوَلٌ. (S, O, Msb, K. *) السَّبْعُ
الطُّوَلُ, i. e. The seven longer chapters of the
Kur-án, (O, TA,) are the chapter of البَقَرَة and
the next five chapters of which the last is الأَعْرَاف,
and one other, which is the chapter of يُونُس, or
الأَنْفَال and بَرَآءَة together, these being regarded
as one chapter, (O, K, TA,) or, as some say,
الكَهْف, and some say التَّوْبَة [which is the same
as بَرَآءَة]; and some say [the chapters vulgarly
