طِيبٌ (S [but there mentioned app. as a subst.],
O, Mgh, Msb, K) and طِيبَةٌ (S, O, K) and طَابٌ
(K) and طُوبَى [q. v. infrà] (Ksh and Bd in
xiii. 28) and تَطْيَابٌ, (S, K,) [the last of which
is of a measure denoting intensiveness, and is
said in the TA to be with fet-h because it is
unsound, whereas the inf. n. of a sound verb,
if of the measure تفعال, is with kesr, but this
is a strange mistake, (see 2 in art. بين,)] It was,
or became, the contr. of خَبِيث, (S, Mgh,) in two
senses: (Mgh:) [i. e.] it was, or became, [good,]
pleasant, delightful, delicious, sweet, or savoury;
syn. لَذَّ; (A, K;) or كَانَ لَذِيذًا; (Msb;) or it
was esteemed [good,] pleasant, delightful, delicious,
sweet, or savoury, in taste, and in odour:
(Mgh:) and it was, or became, pure, (Mgh,
K,) or clean. (Mgh.) [See also طَيِّبٌ.] ―
-b2-
[Hence,] طَابَتْ نَفْسُهُ (assumed tropical:)  His mind [or he himself]
was, or became, [cheerful, happy, pleased,] dilated,
or free from straitness. (Msb.) And طِبْتُ بِهِ
نَفْسًا i. q. طَابَتْ بِهِ نَفْسِى (assumed tropical:)  [i. e. I, or my mind,
was, or became, cheerful, happy, pleased, or
dilated, by means of it; agreeably with what
next precedes: or pleased, content, or willing, to
grant, concede, give, or do, it]: (S, O, K:) [for]
طَابَتْ نَفْسُهُ بِالشَّىْءِ [often] signifies (tropical:)  He granted,
conceded, or gave, the thing, liberally, [willingly,
or of his own good pleasure,] without constraint,
and without anger. (TA.) And فَعَلْتُ ذٰلِكَ
بِطِيبَةِنَفْسٍ (assumed tropical:)  I did that [of my own free will;
willingly;] not being constrained by any one. (S,
O.) And طَابَتْ نَفْسِى عَلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  [My mind was
agreeable to it]; said when a thing is agreeable,
or suitable, to one's mind; and [in like manner]
طِبْتُ نَفْسًا عَلَيْهِ. (TA.) And طَابَتْ نَفْسُهُ لِلْعَمَلِ
وَغَيْرِهِ [He was cheerful, happy, pleased, or
willing, to do work &c.]. (K in art. نشط.) And
طَابَتْ نَفْسِى عَنْ ذٰلِكَ تَرْكًا (assumed tropical:)  [I was pleased,
willing, or content, to leave, give up, relinquish,
or be without, that]; and [in like manner] طِبْتُ
نَفْسًا عَنْهُ: whence, in the Kur [iv. 3], فَإِنْ طِبْنَ
لَكُمْ عَنْ شَىْءٍ مِنْهُ نَفْسًا (assumed tropical:)  [But if they be pleased,
or willing, or content, to give up, or relinquish, or
remit, unto you somewhat thereof]. (TA.) ―
-b3-
And طاب, (A, O, Msb, TA,) inf. n. طِيبٌ (Msb,
K) and طِيبَةٌ, (K,) (tropical:)  It was, or became, lawful,
allowable, or free. (A, O, Msb, K, * TA.) [In
the K, الطِّيبُ and الطِّيبَةُ are expl. as meaning
الحِلُّ, which Golius has supposed to mean in this
case “ quod licitum, legitimum; ” and which
Freytag has in like manner expl. as meaning
“ res licita,” and “ licitum: ” but it is here an
inf. n., of حَلَّ; not syn. with the epithet الحَلَالُ,
which is given as an explanation of الطَّيِّبُ.]
You say, طَابَ لِى كَذَا (tropical:)  Such a thing became,
or has become, lawful, &c., to me. (A.) Hence
the saying of Aboo-Hureyreh, اَلْآنَ طَابَ الضِّرَابُ,
(TA,) or طَابَ امْضَرْبُ, (O, TA,) as some relate
it, accord. to the dial. of Himyer, (TA,) meaning
طَاب الضَّرْبُ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Now fighting has become lawful. (O, TA.) فَانْكِحُوا مَا طَابَ لَكُمْ مِنَ النِّسَآءِ, in
the Kur [iv. 3], means (assumed tropical:)  [Then take ye in marriage] such as are lawful to you [of women].

K,) and ↓ اطابهُ, (TA,) and ↓ أَطْيَبَهُ, and ↓ طيّبهُ,

doubtful,]) He found it, (S, K,) or saw it,

not so accord. to the A.] ―
-b3-  And استطاب He

-b4-  And He asked
people for sweet water. (K.) Thus, accord. to

means And when they asked for sweet water [the

طَابٌ is an inf. n. of طَابَ, (K,) and syn. with

praising 'Omar Ibn-'Abd-El-'Azeez,
مُقَابَلُ الإِعْرَاقِ فِى الطَّابِ الطَّابْ
بَيْنَ أَبِى العَاصِى وَآلِ الخَطَّابْ
[i. e. Rooted by the father's and the mother's side
in unsullied goodness, or the like, between Abu-l-
'Ásee on the one side and the family of ElKhattáb on the other: for it is evidently cited
as an ex. of الطاب used as a subst. and as an
epithet; so that by فى الطاب الطاب is meant فى
الطِّيبِ الطَّيِّبِ: otherwise it might be supposed
that the literal repetition is meant to denote
simply corroboration, as appears to be the case
in an instance which will be mentioned in what
follows:] the object of praise being the son of
'Abd-El-'Azeez the son of Marwán the son of
El-Hakam the son of Abu-l-'Ás [or 'Ásee], and
his mother being Umm-'Ásim the daughter of
'Ásim the son of 'Omar the son of El-Khattáb.

-b2-  عَذْقُ ابْنِ طَابٍ is the name of A sort
of palm-trees in El-Medeeneh [app. so called

may in this instance be for طَابَة, a name of ElMedeeneh]: (K:) or, as also رُطَبُ ابْنِ طَابٍ, a
sort of dates of El-Medeeneh: (S, O:) or اِبْنُ
طَابٍ is a name of a sort of fresh ripe dates: (K:)
and عَذْقُ ابْنِ طَابٍ and عَذْقُ ابْنِ زَيْدٍ are two
sorts of dates: (S:) accord. to IAth, رُطَبُ ابْنِ
طَابٍ is the name of a sort of dates of El-Medeeneh
so called in relation to Ibn-Táb, a man of its inhabitants. (TA.) ―
-b3-  طاب طاب is [asserted to
be] One of the names of the Prophet in the Gospel; [but where said to occur, I know not;] the
interpretation of مأذ مأذ; [app. a mistranscription
for مَاذ مَاذ, meaning “ very good in disposition,”
&c.;] the second word corroborating, and denoting
intensiveness of signification. (TA.)
طُوبٌ, mentioned in this art. in the S and K,
[as though it were originally طُيْبٌ,] see in art.
طوب.
طِيبٌ an inf. n. of طَابَ. (O, Mgh, * Msb, K.)
[Used as a simple subst., Goodness, pleasantness,
&c.] You say, مَا بِهِ مِنَ الطِّيبِ [There is not in
him aught of goodness, &c.]: you should not say,
من الطِّيبَةِ. (S, O.) [See also طَابٌ: and طُوبَى.]
―
-b2-  [Also] a word of well-known meaning; (K;)
[A perfume; a fragrant, or an odoriferous, substance;] a substance with which one perfumes
himself, (S, O, Msb,) of what is termed عِطْر.
(Msb.) [The pl. accord. to Golius and Freytag
is أَطْيَابٌ. Hence, جَوْزُ الطِّيبِ The nutmeg: see
جوز.] ―
-b3-  Also The most excellent of any sort of
thing. (K.) [See also أَطْيَبُ: and طَيِّبَةٌ.]
طَابَةٌ Wine: (S, O, K:) as though meaning
طَيِّبَةٌ; and originally طَيَبَةٌ: (AM, TA:) or i. q.
عَصِيرٌ [i. e. expressed juice]. (TA, from an explanation of a trad.)
-A2-  طَابَةُ: see what next
follows.
طَيْبَةُ a name of The city of the Prophet; (S,
O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ طَابَةُ, (O, Msb, K,) and
↓ الطَّيِّبَةُ, and ↓ المُطَيَّبَةُ, (K,) which last may be also
written ↓ المُطَيِّبَةُ. (TA.)
طِيبَةٌ an inf. n. of طَابَ. (S, O, K.) ―
-b2-  Also
The clearest of wine: (K:) and the choicest of
herbage. (TA.)
-A2-  طِيبَةُ is a name of The well
Zemzem. (O, K.)
سَبْىٌ طِيَبَةٌ (tropical:)  Persons (As, TA) made captive
lawfully, (As, S, * A, O, * K, * TA,) without perfidy
and breach of covenant, (S, A, O, K,) not made
so when a covenant is existing with them, (As,
TA,) nor when there is any doubt respecting their
state of slavery: (O:) طِيَبَةٌ, in the sense of طَيِّبٌ,
is [said to be] the only instance among nouns,
(TA,) or rather among epithets, (MF, TA,) of
فِعَلَةٌ, with kesr and then fet-h, (TA,) i. e. with
only fet-h to the ع. (MF, TA.)
طُوبَى, of the measure فُعْلَى from الطِّيبُ,
originally طُيْبَى, (Zj, S, O, Msb,) an inf. n. of
طَابٌ, (Ksh and Bd in xiii. 28,) syn. with طِيبٌ:
(Seer, K: [in my MS copy of the K طَيِّب, a
manifest mistake:]) and fem. of أَطْيَبُ: (ISd,
K:) and pl. of طَيِّبَةٌ, (K,) accord. to Kr, who
says that there is no word like it except كُوسَى
pl. of كَيِّسَةٌ, and ضُوقَى pl. of ضَيِّقَةٌ; but ISd
says that, in his opinion, طُوبَى and كُوسَى and
ضُوقَى are fems. of أَطْيَبُ and أَكْيَسُ and أَضْيَقُ,
because فُعْلَى is not a pl. measure: Kr also adds
that they did not say ↓ طِيبَى, like as they said
كِيسَى and ضِيقَى; (TA; [see ضُوقَى, in art.
ضيق;]) [but Sgh says that] ↓ طِيبَى is a dial. var.
of طُوبَى: (O:) Aboo-Hátim Sahl Ibn-Mohammad Es-Sijistánee relates that an Arab of the
desert, reciting as a pupil to him, persisted in
pronouncing طُيْبَى for طُوبَى: (TA:) it signifies
حُسْنَى [as meaning A good final, or ultimate,
state or condition]: and (some say, O, Msb) خَيْرٌ
[meaning good, good fortune, and the like]: (O,
Msb, K:) and خِيرَةٌ [meaning God's blessing or
favour, &c.]; (K;) as some say: (TA:) or
eternal life: (Zj, TA:) or a pleasant life: (Msb:)
and (O, K) a certain tree in Paradise; (S, O,
K;) thus the Prophet is related to have said;
and MF says that it is a proper name thereof,
not admitting the article ال, and the like is said
in the M: (TA:) or it signifies Paradise in the
Indian language; (O, K;) or, accord. to Sa'eed
Ibn-Jubeyr, in the Abyssinian language: (O:)
as also ↓ طِيبَى. (K.) These different significations are assigned by different persons to this
word in the phrase in the Kur [xiii. 28] طُوبَى لَهُمْ
[which seems to be best rendered as an announcement, meaning A good final state, &c., shall be
to them, or be their lot]: (Msb, TA:) Sb holds
that it is an invocation of good, or a prayer, [as
though قُلْ i. e. “ say thou ” were understood
before it,] and that طوبى is virtually in the nom.
case, i. e. مَرْفُوع, as is shown by the words immediately following وَحُسْنُ مَآبٍ: but Th, who
makes طوبى to be an inf. n. like رُجْعَى, says
that one reading is طُوبَى لَهُمْ وَحُسْنَ مَآبٍ, like
the phrase سَقْيًا لَهُ: MF, however, [supposing
Th to have said طُوبًى, though I think it indubitable that he said طُوبَى, and only meant
that it was used as virtually, not literally, with
tenween,] observes that رُجْعًى, with tenween, is
not known to have been transmitted from any one
of the leading authorities on the Arabic language.
(TA.) Katádeh says that طُوبَى لَهُمْ is a phrase
of the Arabs; who say, طُوبَى لَكَ إِنْ فَعَلْتَ كَذَا
وَكَذَا [A good final state &c., be to thee, or be
thy lot, or shall be to thee, if thou do such and
such things]: and it is said in a trad., طُوبَى لِلشَّأْمِ
[May good, &c., betide Syria]; in which case,
طوبى is of the measure فُعْلَى from الطِّيبُ, and
does not mean “ Paradise,” nor “ the tree. ” (L,
TA.) One says, طُوبَى لَكَ and طُوبَاكَ; (S, K;)
but not طُوَبيْكَ: (Yaakoob, S, O: [in one of my
copies of the S طُوبِيكَ:]) or طُوبَاكَ is a barbarism:
(O, K:) it is disallowed by the T, and by most
of the grammarians: but Akh says that it is used
by some of the Arabs; and Ibn-El-Moatezz uses
it in the following verse:
مَرَّتْ بِنَا سَحَرًا طَيْرٌ فَقُلْتُ لَهَا
طُوبَاكِ يَا لَيْتَنَا إِيَّاكِ طُوبَاكِ
[A flock of birds passed by us a little before daybreak, and I said to them, Good betide you:
would that we were you: good betide you]: Esh-
Shiháb El-Khafájee says that ل is understood
[before the ك] in طوباك; but MF has argued
well against this assertion. (TA.)
طِيبَى: see the next preceding paragraph,
former half, in three places.
طِيَابٌ A sort of palm-trees of El-Basrah, (L,
K, TA,) the dates of which, when the gathering
has been delayed beyond the usual time, fall, one
after another, from their stones, so that the raceme
remains with nothing upon it but the stones hanging to the bases of the dates; though they are
large; and if the fruit is gathered when fully
ripe, the stone does not come off with it. (L, TA.)
طَيِّبٌ (S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and ↓ طَابٌ,

مُطِيبٌ [part. n. of 4: as such signifying] A
lawful wedder: a woman said to her beloved,
وَلَا زُرْتَنَا إِلَّا وَأَنْتَ مُطِيبُ
[Nor didst thou visit us save when thou wast a
lawful wedder]: because, in the estimation of
excessive lovers, what is unlawful is more sweet.
(TA.)
مَطَابَةٌ: see أَطْيَبُ.
مَطْيَبَةٌ [A cause of pleasure or delight]. One

And in like manner one says of food. (TA.)
مُطَيَّبٌ pass. part. n. of 2. (TA.) Hence,
(TA,) حِلْفُ المُطَيَّبِينَ [The covenant of the perfumed men]: (K, TA:) these were five tribes;
Benoo-'Abd-Menáf and Benoo-Asad-Ibn-'AbdEl-'Ozzà and Benoo-Teym and Benoo-Zuhrah
and Benu-l-Hárith and Benoo-Fihr: (TA:) and
they were so called for the following reason:
when Benoo-'Abd-Menáf desired to assume [the
offices of] the حِجَابَة and the رِفَادَة and the لِوَآء
and the سِقَايَة, [see arts. حجب &c.,] which belonged to Benoo-'Abd-ed-Dár, and these refused
their consent, all of the above-mentioned, (K,
TA,) having assembled in the house of Ibn-Jud'án, in the Time of Ignorance, (TA,) concluded a ratified covenant for the accomplishment of their affair, engaging not to fail in aiding
one another: then they mixed some perfumes,
and dipped their hands therein; after which they
wiped their hands upon the Kaabeh in token of
confirmation of the covenant: and Benoo-'Abded-Dár, also, and their confederates, (K, TA,)
composing six tribes, Benoo-'Abd-ed-Dár and
Jumah and Makhzoom and 'Adee and Kaab
and Sahm, (TA,) concluded together another
covenant, and were thence called الأَحْلَاف: (K,
TA:) this is the account commonly known and
received: another account is the following: there
came a man of the Benoo-Zeyd to Mekkeh for
the purpose of [the religious visit termed] the
عُمْرَة, having with him merchandise, and a man
of Sahm bought this of him, and refused to pay
him for it; whereupon he called to them from
the summit of Aboo-Kubeys, and they arose, and
entered into a covenant together to do him
justice: thus relates Eth-Tha'álibee: (TA:)
Mohammad was one of the مُطَيَّبُون, (K, TA,)
being then twenty-five years old; and so was
Aboo-Bekr: and 'Omar was an أَحْلَفِىّ. (TA.)
