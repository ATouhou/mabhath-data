روع1
رَاعَهُ, (IAar, Az, S, Msb, K, *) aor. يَرُوعُ
(Mgh,) inf. n. رَوْعٌ (Msb, TA) and رُوعٌ and رُوُوعٌ
and رُؤُوعٌ, (IAar, TA,) [He, or it, affected his
رُوع, i. e. heart, or mind, with fright, or fear;]
fear of it (namely an affair or event) reached his
رُوع; (Az, TA;) he, or it, (a man, S, or an
affair or event, IAar, TA, or a thing, Msb,) frightened him; put him in fear; made him afraid;
(S, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also ↓ روّعهُ, (S, Msb, K, *)
inf. n. تَرْوِيعٌ: (TA:) or its beauty and abundance
or multitude frightened him: (Lth, TA:) and
↓ the latter also, it frightened him by its abundance or multitude, or its beauty. (TA.) Hence
the saying, in a trad., إِذَا شَمِطَ لإِنْسَانُ فِى عَارِضَيْهِ
فَذٰلِكَ الرَّوْعُ, as though meaning [When the man
becomes grizzled in the hair of the two sides of
his face, that is] the warning of death. (TA.)
You say also, [using the pass. form,] رِيعَ, aor.
يُرَاعُ, (TA,) inf. n. رَوْعٌ, (S, K,) He was, or
became, frightened, or afraid; or he feared;
(S, * K, * TA;) as also ↓ ارتاع, and ↓ تروّع. (S,
K, TA.) And رَاعَ مِنْهُ, aor. يَرُوعُ, inf. n. رَوْعٌ,
He was, or became, frightened at it, or afraid of
it; or he feared it. (TK. [But I know of no
authority on which this is founded, except a
prov. (cited in art. جعر) , in which some read
رُوعِى جَعَارِ instead of رُوغِى.]) To a man, you say,
لَا تُرَعْ [Be not thou frightened;] fear not thou;
let not fear overtake thee: and to a woman,
لَا تُرَاعِى. (S, TA.) And hence the saying, in a
trad., لَنْ تُرَاعَوْا مَا رَأَيْنَا مِنْ شَىْءٍ [Ye shall not be
frightened, or afraid: we saw not, or have not
seen, anything]. (TA.) You also say, مِنْهُ ↓ ارتاع
and لَهُ He was, or became, frightened at, or
afraid of, him, or it; or he feared him, or it.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  (tropical:)  [It affected his رُوع, i. e. heart, or
mind, with a sudden surprise; it took him by
surprise.] One says, مَا رَاعَنِى إِلَّا مَجِيؤُكَ meaning (tropical:)  [Nothing took me by surprise but thy
coming; i. e. I was surprised by thy coming; or]
I knew not save thy coming; as though he said,
nothing struck my رُوع but thy coming. (TA.)
And خَرَجْتُ وَ مَا رَاعَنِى إِلَّا فُلَانٌ لِالبَابِ (assumed tropical:)  [I went
forth, and nothing took me by surprise but such
a one at the door]; which is equivalent to saying,
and lo, such a one was at the door. (Har p. 207.)
And it is said in a trad. of I'Ab, فَلَمْ يَرُعْنِى إِلَّا
رَجُلٌ آخِذٌ بِمَنْكِبِى, i. e. I knew not [save a man
taking hold of, or seizing, my shoulder-joint]; as
though he came upon him suddenly, or unexpectedly, without any previous appointment, and
without knowledge, and so that event frightened
him. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [It affected his رُوع, i. e. heart,
or mind, with admiration, or pleasure;] it excited
his admiration and approval; it pleased him, or
rejoiced him; (S, Msb, K;) said of beauty [&c.].
(Msb.) It is said in a trad., describing the people
of Paradise, فَيَرُوعُهُ مَا عَلَيْهِ مِنَ اللِّبَاسِ And what
is upon him, of apparel, excites his admiration
&c., by its beauty. (TA.) ―
-b4-  [It (drink) cooled
it, (namely, the heart,) or allayed its thirst.] A
poet says,
سَقَتْنِى شَرْبَةً رَاعَتْ فُؤَادِى
سَقَاهَا اللّٰهُ مِنْ حَوْضِ الرَّسُولِ
[She gave me to drink a draught that cooled, or
allayed the thirst of, my heart: may God give
her to drink from the pool of the Apostle in
Paradise]. (TA.) You say also, هٰذِهِ شَرْبَةٌ رَاعَ
بِهَا فُؤَادِى [which may be rendered This is a
draught by which he has cooled, or allayed the
thirst of, my heart; and it is implied in the TA
that this is the right meaning: or it means] this
is a draught by which the thirst, or vehement
thirst, of my heart has been allayed: (so accord.
to the pointing in the copies of the K:) mentioned
by Az. (TA.)
-A2-  The verb from رَوَعٌ [q. v. infrà]
is one and the same [whether trans. or intrans.;
i. e., you say رَاعَهُ, aor. يَرُوعُ, inf. n. رَوْعٌ, meaning
“He,” or “it, excited his admiration and approval,” &c., as expl. above; and رَاعَ, app. with
the same aor. and inf. n., meaning He possessed
the quality of exciting admiration and approval
by his beauty and the pleasingness of his aspect,
or by his courage, &c.; and in like manner,
رَاعَتْ, said of a woman]; the trans. verb [in this
case] being like the trans. [in other cases], and
the intrans. [in this case] like the intrans. [in
other cases]: but the regular form, accord. to
Az, of the [intrans.] verb hence derived is رَوِعَ,
aor. يَرْوَعُ, inf. n. رَوَعٌ. (TA.)
-A3-  رَاعَ فِى يَدِى
كَذَا: see art. ريع. ―
-b2-  And رَاعَ, aor. يَرُوعُ, and
يَرِيعُ, inf. n. of the former رُوَاعٌ, and of the latter
رَيْعٌ: see art. ريع.

رَوَّعَ see 1, first sentence, in two places.

تَرَوَّعَ see 1, in the former half of the paragraph.

إِرْتَوَعَ see 1, in the former half of the paragraph,
in two places. ―
-b2-  ارتاع لِلْخَيْرِ i. q. ارتاح لَهُ [He
was affected by alacrity, cheerfulness, briskness,
liveliness, or sprightliness, disposing him to promptness to do good; he inclined to, and loved, doing
good]. (AZ.)
رَوْعٌ [see 1, of which it is an inf. n. ―
-b2- ] Fright,
or fear; (S, K;) as also ↓ رَوعٌ [accord. to some,
but this seems to be little known]. (TA.) Hence
the saying, أَفْرَخَ رَوْعُهُ His fright, or fear, departed. (S.) Az says, All the lexicologists whom
I have met say أَفْرَخَ رَوْعُهُ, with fet-h to the ر [in
روعه], except El-Mundhiree, who informs me
that AHeyth used to say, It is only ↓ افرخ رَوْعُكَ,
with damm. (TA.) Accord. to different relations
of a trad., you say, ↓ أَفْرَخَ رُوعُكَ, meaning Fright,
or fear, hath departed from thy heart; or may
fright, or fear, depart from thy heart; (K, TA;)
thus expl. by AHeyth; (TA;) and افرخ رَوْعُكَ,
with fet-h; or this latter, only, is the right, and
means what thou fearest hath quitted thee, and
departed from thee, and become removed; or may
what thou fearest quit thee, &c.; as though it
were taken from the young bird's going forth
from the egg, (K, TA,) and the darkness' becoming removed from it; thus expl. by Aboo-Ahmad
El-Hasan Ibn-' Abd-Allah Ibn-Sa'eed El-' Askeree;
and AO says that افرخ روعك [thus in the TA,
without any syll. signs,] means let thy fright, or
fear, depart, for the case is not as thou fearest
it to be. (TA.) It is also said, in a trad. of
Mo'áwiyeh, that he wrote in a letter to Ziyád,
↓ لِيُفْرِخْ رُوعُكَ, with damm; (K, TA;) but the
opinion commonly obtaining with the leading
lexicologists is, that it is with fet-h; except
AHeyth, who relates it thus, with damm; (TA;)
meaning Dismiss thou the رَوْع from thy رُوع;
(K, TA;) i. e., the fright, or fear, from thy
heart: (TA:) for you say أَفْرَخَتِ البَيْضَةُ when
the young bird quits the egg; and رَوْع is fright,
or fear, which does not depart from itself, but
from its place, which is the رُوع, with damm;
(AHeyth, K;) the رَوْع in the رُوع being like the
young bird in the egg: in like manner also one
says أَفْرَخَ فُؤَادُ الرَّجُلِ when a man's fright, or fear,
departs: but Dhu-r-Rummeh, though knowing the
meaning, has made an inversion, saying,
قَدْ أَفْرَخَتْ عَنْ رُوعِهِ الكُرَبُ
[for قَدْ أَفْرَخَ عَنِ الكُرَبِ رُوعُهُ His heart had freed
itself from griefs]. (AHeyth, TA.) AHeyth
adds, (TA,) one also says, عَنِ الأَمْرِ ↓ أَفْرِخَ رُوعَكَ,
or عَلَى الأَمْرِ, [accord. to different copies of the
K, the latter being the reading in the TA, but
the former probably the right,] meaning [Free
thy heart from the affair; i. e.] be thou tranquil,
and without fear. (K, TA.) Az observes, What
AHeyth says is clear; but I am averse from it
because of his being alone in his saying; though
sometimes later authorities correct things in which
the earlier have erred; therefore the correctness
of AHeyth may not be [absolutely] denied in
this matter, seeing that he had an ample share of
knowledge. (TA.) [See also art. فرخ, in several
places.] ―
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  War, or battle; as in the phrase,
شَهِدَ الرَّوْعَ (tropical:) [He witnessed, or was present at or
in, war, or battle]. (TA.) [See also an ex. in a
verse cited voce سَعَفٌ.]
رُوعٌ The heart: (S, Msb, K:) or the part
thereof which is the place of رَوْع, i. e. fear: (K, *
TA:) or the سَوَاد [or core, &c.,] thereof: (K:)
and the mind: (S, Msb, K, * TA:) and the understanding; or intellect. (S, K.) See رَوْعٌ, in five
places. You say, وَقَعَ ذٰلِكَ فِى رُوعِى That came
into my mind. (S, Msb, * TA.) And it is said in
a trad., إِنَّ الرُّوحَ نَفَثَ فِى رُوعِى [Verily
the Trusted, or Trusty, Spirit (meaning Gabriel)
inspired into my mind, or heart]. (S.) You say
also, ثَابِ رُوعُهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He went to [app. a
mistake for from] a thing, and then returned to
it. (TA.)
رَوَعٌ The quality of exciting admiration and
approval by beauty (S, K) and pleasingness
of aspect, or by courage; (K;) the quality
denoted by the epithet أَرْوَعُ, applied to a man,
(S, K, *) and رَوْعَآءُ, applied to a woman. (S.)
[See also 1, near the end of the paragraph.]
رَوِعٌ: see رَائِعٌ; last sentence.
رَوْعَةٌ A fit of fright or fear: (S, K, TA:) pl.
رَوَعَاتٌ; (TA;) which is applied by Tarafeh to
the frights occasioned by a stallion-camel to a
she-camel when he desires to cover her. (EM,
p. 66.) It is said in a trad., فَأَعْطَاهُمْ بِرَوْعَةِ الخَيْلِ,
meaning And he gave them something for the
fright occasioned to their women and their
children by the horsemen. (TA.) ―
-b2-  A trait, or
sign, or mark, of beauty [that affects the رُوع, or
heart]: (IAar, K:) beauty that excites admiration and approval, or pleases, or rejoices. (TA.)
رُوَاعُ الفُؤَادِ and رُوَاعَةُ الفُؤَادِ, applied to a she-camel, Quick, spirited, vigorous; sharp in spirit;
syn. شَهْمَةٌ ذَكِيَّةٌ: (K:) and [in like manner]
↓ رَوْعَآءُ, applied to a she-camel and a mare, (S, K,)
but not to a male [in this sense, i. e. its masc.
form, أَرْوَعُ, is not thus used], (S,) sharp in spirit;
syn. حَدِيدَةُ الفُؤَادِ: (S, K:) in the T, رُوَاعٌ, without ة, is applied as an epithet to a mare: and
IAar says that ↓ رَوْعَآءُ, thus applied, is not from
رَائِعَةٌ, but means one that is as though she were
fearful, by reason of her sharpness, and briskness, or lightness, of spirit: he says also, that
↓ أَرْوَعُ, applied to a horse, is like this epithet
applied to a man; and IB says, in art. عجس,
that, applied to a man, it signifies quickly frightened or afraid: it is also applied to a heart,
meaning that is frightened, [or startled,] by reason
of its sharpness, at everything that is heard or
seen; and so رُوَاعٌ. (TA.) [See also رَائِعٌ, and
أَرْوَعُ mentioned and expl. therewith.]
رَائِعٌ [act. part. n. of رَاعَهُ, q. v.,] Frightening;
putting in fear; making afraid; [and particu-
larly] by its beauty and abundance or multitude.
(Lth, TA.) ―
-b2-  Applied to beauty, That excites
admiration and approval in the رُوع [i. e. heart,
or mind,] of him who beholds it, and pleases him,
or rejoices him. (TA.) Applied to a man, (K, *
TA,) as also ↓ أَرْوَعُ (S, K, TA) so applied, (S,
TA,) Who excites admiration and approval by
his beauty (S, K, TA) and pleasingness of aspect,
(K, TA,) with generousness, or nobleness, and excellence, and lordly condition; (TA;) or by his
courage: (K, TA:) or the former, beautiful in
countenance, who excites admiration and approval
by his pleasingness of aspect and by the goodliness
of his form or figure or state of apparel and the
like: or, as some say, who frightens men by his
aspect, inspiring reverence or awe: but the former
explanation is the more reasonable: and ↓ the
latter epithet, a beautiful man, who excites admiration and approval in him who beholds him: or,
as some say, sharp; lively in spirit, and sharp in
intellect: (TA:) [see also the next preceding
paragraph:] the fem. of the former is with ة:
(TA:) that of the latter, ↓ رَوْعَآءُ: (S:) the pl. of
رَائِعٌ is أَرْوَاعٌ, (K, * TA,) applied to men, like as
رَوَائِعُ [the pl. of رَائِعَةٌ] is to women: (TA:) and
the pl. of أَرْوَعُ and رَوْعَآءُ is ↓ رُوعٌ, (K, TA,) applied
to men and to women. (TA.) You say also,
فَرَسٌ رَائِعٌ A beautiful horse, that frightens (يُرُوعُ,
i. e. يُخَوِّفُ, [or rather startles, but better rendered
excites admiration and approval in, or pleases,
or rejoices,]) the beholder by his beauty: (Mgh:)
and فَرَسٌ رَائِعَةٌ, and ↓ رَوْعَآءُ, [but see, respecting
the latter, a remark of IAar in the next preceding
paragraph,] a mare that excites admiration and
approval, or pleases, or rejoices, (تَرُوعُ,) by her
generousness, or excellence, or high blood, and her
description. (TA.) [See also art. ريع, to which, as
well as to the present art., رَائِعٌ, applied to a horse,
is said, in the TA, to belong.] And زِينَةٌ رَائِعَةٌ
Beautiful ornament. (TA.) And كَلَامٌ رَائِعٌ
(tropical:)  Surpassing, or excelling, speech, or language.
(TA.)
-A2-  Also Frightened, or afraid; and so
↓ رَوِعٌ, with the و unaltered, as though it were of
the measure فَعِيلٌ: [or both signify having fright
or fear: for] each is a possessive epithet: or the
former may be of the measure فَاعِلٌ in the sense
of the measure مَفْعُولٌ [and therefore have the
signification first given]. (TA.)
أَرْوَعُ: fem. رَوْعَآءُ: pl. رُوعٌ: see the two paragraphs next preceding; the former in three places;
the latter, in five.
