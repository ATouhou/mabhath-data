رمك1
رَمَكَ بِالمَكَانِ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.
رَمُكَ, (S,) inf. n.
رُمُوكٌ, (S, K,) He remained, stayed, dwelt, or
abode, in the place, (S, Msb, K,) not quitting it:
or he did so being fatigued, or wearied, or distressed: (K:) or رَمَكَ signifies he (a man) made
his home, or constant residence, in a country, or
town. (AZ, TA.) ―
-b2-  رَمَكَتِ المَاشِيَةُ, (O,) or الإِبِلُ,
(K,) inf. n. as above, (O,) The cattle were confined, (O,) or the camels kept constantly, (K,)
at the water, (O, K,) and were fed with fodder.
(O.) ―
-b3-  رَمَكَ فِى الطَّعَامِ, aor. and inf. n. as above,
[app. He kept constantly to the food;] he loathed
nothing of the food: and so رَجَنَ, aor.
رَمُكَ, inf. n.
رُجُونٌ: (L, TA:) both mentioned by Lh. (TA
in art. رجن.)
-A2-  رَمَكَ, said of a man, also signifies He was, or became, lean, or emaciated, and
what was in his hands went away. (O, TA. [See
also 9: and see رَمَكَةٌ, as applied to a man.]) ―
-b2-
[It seems also that this verb is used in a similar
sense in relation to a beast; like ارمكّ said of a
camel: for it is immediately added in the O and
TA without any explanation, that one also says,
↓ هٰذِهِ دَابَّةٌ رَامِكَةٌ, as though meaning This is a
lean beast: and رَمَكَتْ, inf. n. رُمُوكٌ, as though
meaning It was, or became, lean.]
4
أَرْمَكْتُهُ I made him to remain, stay, dwell,
or abide, in a place, (S, K,) not quitting it. (K.)
―
-b2-  And ارمك الإِبِلَ He (a pastor) kept the camels
constantly at the water, and fed them with fodder.
(TA.)
9
ارمكّ He was, or became, of the colour
termed رُمْكَةٌ: said of a camel in this sense [and
in another expl. in what follows]. (S, K.)
-A2-  It
(a thing, Ibn-'Abbád, O) was, or became, thin,
or slender. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.) And He (a
camel) was, or became, lean, lank, light of flesh;
slender; or lean, and lank in the belly; and emaciated. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K. [In the CK, نَهِكَ is
erroneously put for نُهِكَ.])
10
اِسْتَرْمَكَ القَوْمُ (tropical:)  The people were deemed
ignoble; (K, TA;) as being likened to the رَمَكَة.
(TA.)
رَمَكٌ: see رَمَكَةٌ. ―
-b2-  In the saying of Ru-beh,
يَرْبِضُ فِى الرَّوْثِ كَبِرْذَوْنِ الرَّمَكْ
[That lies down upon his breast in the dung of
horses, or similar beasts, like the jade, or hack, of
the رَمَك], AA says, الرمك, here, is from the Pers.
رَمَهْ [which means a “ herd," ” “ flock,” “ troop,”
or the like]; and he adds that the people's saying
that it means الرَّمَكَة is a mistake. (O, TA. [Perhaps, however, AA knew not رَمَكٌ as a coll.
gen. n. of which رَمَكَةٌ is the n. un.; for as such it
seems to me more reasonable to regard it in this
instance.])
رُمْكَةٌ A certain colour of camels; accord. to
A 'Obeyd, a dun colour; i. e. a كٌمْتَة [or brown
hue] so intense as to have in it a blackness: (S:)
thus explained by As: (TA:) or, in the colours
of camels, brownness; i. e. redness intermixed
with blackness: (Kr, TA:) or a colour more
dusky, or dingy, than that which is termed زُرْقَة
[q. v.]: (Msb:) or the colour of ashes: (K:) or
وُرْقَةٌ [which is a colour like that of ashes] inclining to blackness: or, as some say, دُونَ الوُرْقَةِ
[less intense than what is termed وَرقة]: (TA:)
it sometimes has for its pl. رُمُكٌ, with two dammehs. (ISd, TA.)
رَمَكَةٌ A mare: and [particularly] a بِرْذَوْنَة [or
mare of mean breed], (Lth, Mgh, K,) the female
of the بَرَاذِين, (S, Msb,) that is taken for breeding: (Lth, Mgh, K:) pl. رِمَاكٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,)
accord. to rule, (Mgh,) and, رَمَكَاتٌ, (S,) and أَرْمَاكٌ,
(Fr, S, Mgh,) formed on the supposition of the
elision of the ة, (Mgh,) or this is a pl. pl., and
the pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.] is ↓ رَمَكٌ. (K.) ―
-b2-
Also (assumed tropical:)  A weak man. (K.)
رَامَكٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.
رَامِكٌ Remaining, staying, dwelling, or abiding,
in a place, (Msb, K,) not quitting: or especially,
when fatigued, or wearied, or distressed. (K.)
-A2-
See also 1, last sentence.
-A3-  Also, and ↓ رَامَكٌ,
(S, Msb, K,) the former of which is the more
usual, or more approved, (TA,) A certain thing,
black, (S, Msb, K,) like pitch, (Msb,) that is
mixed with musk, (S, Msb, K,) and is then called
(يُجْعَلُ) musk. (Msb.) [Freytag, as on the
authority of the K, in which nothing more is said
respecting it than what I have given above,
describes it thus: “ Res ex aliis rebus composita,
nempe atramento sutorio, mali Punici cortice,
gummi Arabico aliisque rebus, quibus admisceri
solet muscus. ”] A poet says, (S,) namely, Khalaf
Ibn-Khaleef El-Akta', (O, TA,)
إِنَّ لَكَ الفَضْلَ عَلَى صُحْبَتِى
وَالمِسْكُ قَدْ يَسْتَصْحِبُ الرَّامَكَا
[Verily thou hast such excellence as renders thee
above my companionship; but musk sometimes
unites with رامك]. (S, O.) ―
-b2-  [↓ رَامَكٌ, from the
Pers. رَامَكْ, is also the name of A certain astringent medicine, used as a remedy for dysentery
&c. In the printed edition of the “ Kánoon ” of
Ibn-Seenà (Avicenna), book ii. p. 253, it is erroneously written رمك.]
أَرْمَكُ Of the colour termed رُمْكَةٌ: (S, Msb, K:)
applied to a camel: fem. رَمْكَآءُ. (S, Msb.) The
رمكآء is said by Honeyf-el-Hanátim, who was one
of the most skilled of the Arabs respecting camels,
to be the most beautiful of she-camels. (TA.)
The fem. is also applied, tropically, to a woman.
(Th, TA.) ―
-b2-  A poet says, [applying it to dust,]
وَالخَيْلُ تَجْتَابُ الغُبَارَ الأَرْمَكَا
[And the horses, or horsemen, cleave the dark
brown, or ash-coloured, &c., dust]. (TA.) ―
-b3-
And it is said in a trad., [but to what it relates I
know not,] The name of the higher, or highest,
land is الرَّمْكَآءُ; said by IAth to be fem. of الأَرْمَكُ.
(TA.)
