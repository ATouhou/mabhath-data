quæ in rebus quæ spectant ad victum perturbatæ
et anxiæ sunt; deriving this meaning from the
rendering in the TK: Golius, with a near approach to correctness, renders it res ad sustentandam vitam necessariæ; but he has given this
explanation as on the authority of J, by whom
it is not mentioned; and has put مَرَاغِبٌ for
