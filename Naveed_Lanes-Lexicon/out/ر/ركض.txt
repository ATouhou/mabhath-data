ركض1
رَكَضَ, aor.
رَكُضَ, inf. n. رَكْضٌ, He moved,
(S, A, K,) or struck with, (Msb,) his leg, or foot:
(S, A, Msb, K:) or he struck and hit therewith,
like as one strikes and hits therewith a beast.
(IAth.) Hence, (S, A, K,) the phrase in the Kur
[xxxviii. 41], (S,) اُرْكُضْ بِرِجْلِكَ [Strike thou the
ground with thy foot]: (S, A, K:) or strike thou,
and tread, the ground with thy foot. (Sgh.) You
say also, رَكَضَ الرَّجُلُ (tropical:)  The man struck the ground
with his foot: and رَكَضَتِ الخَيْلُ (tropical:)  The horses
struck the ground with their hoofs: and جَآءَتِ
الخَيْلُ رَكْضًا (tropical:)  [The horses came striking the ground
with their hoofs]: and رَكَضَتِ الجُنْدَبُ الرَّمْضَآءَ
بِكُرَاعَيْهَا (tropical:)  [The locusts termed جندب struck the
vehemently-hot ground with their two legs]: and
تَرَكْتُهُ يَرْكُضُ بِرِجْلِهِ لِلْمَوْتِ (tropical:)  [I left him striking
the ground with his foot previously to death:
see also 8]. (A.) [The above-mentioned phrases
marked as tropical are so marked on the authority
of the A: but the reason of their being so I do
not see.] ―
-b2-  They also said, sometimes, رَكَضَ
الطَّائِرُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  The bird moved his wings in
flying: (S:) the inf. n., رَكْضٌ, signifying (tropical:)  the
act of moving the wing: (K, TA:) and الطَّائرُ
يَرْكُضُ بِجَنَاحَيْهِ (tropical:)  The bird moves his wings, and
puts them back against his body: (A, TA:) or
the former of these two phrases means (assumed tropical:)  the bird
was quick, or swift, in his flying. (TA.) ―
-b3-  رَكْضٌ
also signifies The act of impelling; syn. دَفْعٌ: and
the urging a horse to run, (A, K, TA,) [by striking]
with his foot or leg: (TA:) the striking a beast
with one's feet or legs, to urge him: (Mgh:) or
putting him in motion, whether he go on or not.
(As.) You say, رَكَضْتُ الفَرَسَ بِرِجْلِى I urged
the horse to run, with my foot or leg. (S, O,
Msb. *) And رَكَضَ الدَّابَّةَ, aor.
رَكُضَ, inf. n. رَكْضٌ, He
struck the sides of the beast with his foot or leg.
(TA.) And رَكَضَ الدَّابَّةَ بِرِجْلٍ, and بِرِجْلَيْنِ,
He struck the beast to urge it with a foot or leg,
and with two feet or legs. (A.) ―
-b4-  And from frequency of usage of the phrase رَكَضْتُ الفَرَسَ,
originated the saying رَكَضَ الفَرَسُ, (AZ, * S, Mgh,
Msb,) meaning (tropical:)  The horse ran: (S, Mgh: *)
which some disallow; but without reason, since
it has been transmitted by a good authority:
(Msb:) it is disallowed by As: (TA:) [and J
says,] the correct phrase is رُكِضَ الفَرَسُ: (S:) or
you say, رُكِضَ الفَرَسُ فَرَكَضَ هُوَ, meaning [The
horse was urged to run,] (assumed tropical:)  and he ran: (K:)
and رَكْضٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  the act of running: (K, in
another place in this art.:) and (assumed tropical:)  the act of fleeing:
whence, [in the Kur xxi. 12], إِذَا هُمْ مِنْهَا يَرْكُضُونَ
(K) (assumed tropical:)  lo, they fled from it, from punishment:
(Zj:) or (assumed tropical:)  were routed, and fled from it: (Fr:)
or they ran from it: (Mgh:) [for] رَكَضَ الرَّجُلُ
signifies (assumed tropical:)  The man fled, and (assumed tropical:)  ran. (ISh.) [Hence,]
رَكَضَتِ النُّجُومُ فِى السَّمَآءِ (tropical:)  The stars moved along
in the sky. (A, TA.) [And hence,] رَكْضٌ also
signifies (assumed tropical:)  A man's going along by both his legs
together. (TA.) ―
-b5-  You also say, رَكَضَهُ البَعِيرُ
(S, A, Msb) (tropical:)  The camel struck him with his kind
leg: (S, Msb:) like as you say, رَمَحَهُ الفَرَسُ:
(A, Msb: *) but you should not say, [when a
camel is the agent,] رَمَحَهُ. (Yaakoob, S.) And
رَكَضَ الأَرْضَ, and الثَّوْبَ, (assumed tropical:)  He struck the ground,
and the garment, or piece of cloth, with his foot
or leg. (TA.) And المَرْأَةُ تَرْكُضُ ذُيُولَهَا وَخَلْخَالَهَا
بِرِجْلَيْهَا إِذَا مَشَتْ (tropical:)  [The woman kicks her skirts
and her anklets with her feet when she walks].

large in her belly, and moved about: (S, O, L,

(A, TA.)

رَكْضَةً An impulse: a motion: (K:) [pl.
رَكَضَاتٌ: see an ex. voce رَفَضَاتٌ.] Hence, (TA,)

رَاكِضٌ, applied to a horse, (tropical:)  Running; as also

رَوَاكِضُ (tropical:)  I passed the night observing the stars

تَرْكَضَى and تِرْكِضَآءُ, the former incorrectly
written in the K تَرْكَضَآءُ, [or, in some copies,
تَرْكُضَآءُ, and the latter in one copy written
تَرْكِضَآءُ,] are there said to be used as examples by
the grammarians, but not explained; and the
author offers his opinion that they are syn. with
رَكْضٌ: (TA:) but this is a strange defect: for
AHei explains them as signifying A certain gait,
in which is a proud and self-conceited air, with
an affected inclining of the body from side to
side: and he asserts the ت to be augmentative:
(MF, TA:) and in the L they are expl. as signifying a particular kind of gait: or meaning as
above. (TA.)
