here used. In the T, in art. رثم, a different
reading is given: لاصبح رَثْمًا.])

-b2-  [Freytag, misled by the CK, has assigned to
رَتْمٌ a signification that belongs to رَتَمٌ.]
رَتَمٌ [applied in the present day to The shrub
broom; to several species thereof: spartium
monospermum of Linn.: genista rætam of Forsk.:
(Delile, Flor. Aegypt. Illustr., no. 657:) spartium: (Forskål, Flora Aegypt. Arab., p. lvi.:)
and phalaris setacea: (Idem, p. lx.:)] a species
of plant: (T:) or a species of tree; (Mgh;) or
so ↓ رَتَمَةٌ; of which the former is the pl. [or
rather coll. gen. n.]: (S:) or the latter, (Lth, T,)
or the former, (AHn, M, K,) the latter being its
n. un., (K,) a certain plant, of the shrub-kind;
(AHn, T, M, K;) as though by reason of its
slenderness, it were likened to the thread, or
string, called رَتَمِ: (AHn, T, * K, * TA: [see this
word voce رَتِيمَةٌ: in the CK, in the present
instance, erroneously written رَقْم:]) and so ↓ رَتِيمَةٌ:
(AHn, T:) its flower is like the خِيرِىّ [or yellow
gilliflower], and its seed is like the lentil: each of
these (i. e. the flower and the seed, TA) strongly
provokes vomiting: the drinking the expressed
juice of its twigs, fasting, is a beneficial remedy
for sciatica (عِرْقُ النَّسَا); and likewise the using as
a clyster an infusion thereof in sea-water: and
the swallowing twenty-one grains thereof, fasting,
prevents the [pustules called] دَمَامِيل. (K.)
When a man was about to make a journey, he
betook himself to two branches, or two trees, and
tied one branch to another, and said, “If my
wife be faithful to the compact, this will remain
tied as it is; otherwise, she will have broken the
compact: ” so says As; and ISk says the like:
(T:) or he betook himself to a tree, (S, K,) or to
the species of tree called رَتَم, (ISk, Mgh,) and
tied together two branches thereof, (ISk, S, Mgh,
K,) or he tied together two trees; (M;) and if he
returned and found them as he tied them, he said
that his wife had not been unfaithful to him;
but otherwise, that she had been so: (ISk, S,
M, Mgh, K:) this [pair of branches or trees] is
called الرَّتَمُ [in the CK, erroneously, الرَّتْمُ] and
↓ الرَّتِيمَةُ: (K:) or this is what is meant by
↓ الرَّتِيمَةُ: (M:) or this [action] is what is meant
by تَعْقَادُ الرَّتَمِ in the following verse: (As, ISk,
T, Mgh:) but IB says that الرَّتَائِمُ [pl. of ↓ الرَّتِيمَةُ]
does not mean peculiarly one kind of trees exclusively of others: and he cites this verse as an
ex. of الرَّتَمُ meaning the threads, or strings, so
called; (TA;) as does AZ. (Mgh.) A rájiz says,
هَلْ يَنْفَعَنْكَ اليَوْمَ إِنْ هَمَّتْ بِهِمْ
كَثْرَةُ مَا تُوصِى وَتَعْقَادُ الرَّتَمْ
[Will the muchness of thine enjoining, and the
tying of the retem, be indeed of use to thee to-day,
if she be desirous of them?]. (T, S, Mgh.) ―

رَتِيمَةٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, K) and ↓ رَتَمَةٌ, (T, M, L,)
the latter written thus by IB on the authority of
'Alee Ibn-Hamzeh, (L, TA,) or ↓ رَتْمَةٌ, (S, K, [in
one copy of the S written رَتَمة, and in my copy
of the Mgh without any syll. signs,] A thread,
or string, that is tied upon the finger for the
purpose of reminding one (T, S, M, Mgh, K) of
some object of want: (T, S:) pl. of the first,
رَتَائِمُ (S, M, Mgh, K) and رِتَامٌ; (M, K;) and
[coll. gen. n.] of the second, ↓ رَتَمٌ; (M, IB;) and
of the third, [if it be correct,] ↓ رَتْمٌ: (K: in the
CK رُتْمٌ:) IAar says that ↓ رَتِيمٌ signifies the
thread, or string, for reminding; but others say
رَتِيمةٌ: Lth says that ↓ رَتِمٌ signifies a thread, or
string, that is tied upon the finger, or upon the
signet-ring, for a sign, or token: (T:) and IB
cites the verse cited above voce رَتَمٌ as an ex. of
this word in the sense here assigned to it as a pl.
[or coll. gen. n.]; (TA;) and so does AZ. (Mgh.)
The binding of رَتَائِم [upon the fingers] is forbidden
in a trad.: and it is said that المُسْتَذْكِرُ بِالرَّتَائِمِ
مُسْتَهْدفٌ للشَّتَائم [He who seeks to remember by
means of the threads, or strings, that are tied
upon the fingers for the purpose of reminding
becomes a butt for revilings]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also
رَتَمٌ, in four places.
رُتَامَي [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned], like سُكَارَي, Persons affected with swooning from eating the plant called الرَّتَم. (K.)
مَا زَالَ رَاتِمًا عَلَي هٰذَا الأَمْرِ means He ceased not
to be constantly occupied in this affair: (T, M,
K, * TA:) Yaakoob asserts that the م of راتما is a
substitute [for ب], though رَتَمَ does not occur in
the sense of رَتَبَ: (M, TA:) IJ says that this
may be the case, or that the word may be from
الرَّتَمَةُ and الرَّتِيمَةُ. (TA.) [See also رَاتبٌ: and see
تُرْتُمٌ, below.]
أَرْتَمُ [app. Having his nose broken. ―
-b2-  And
hence,] One who does not speak clearly, nor
intelligibly; as though his nose were broken:
occurring in a trad.: or, as some relate it, أَرْثَمُ
[q. v.]. (TA.)
شَرُّ تُرْتُمٌ and تُرْتَمٌ Continual, or constant, evil:
(K, TA:) the م is a substitute for the ب of
تُرْتَُب; and the former ت is augmentative, because
there is no word like جُعْفَرٌ consisting of radical
letters. (TA.) [See also رَاتِمًا, above.]
مَرْتُومٌ: see رَتْمٌ.
