رى1
رَيَيْتُ and ↓ رَيَّيْتُ, inf. n. of the former رَىٌّ
and of the latter تَرْيِيَةٌ, are both of them verbs
relating to الرَّايَةُ: (T:) you say, الرَّايَةَ ↓ رَيَّيْتُ
[and رَيَيْتُهَا] I made the رَايَة [q. v.]: (M, TA:)
the imperative of رَيَيْتُ is اِرْيَهْ, and that of ↓ رَيَّيْتُ
is رَيِّهْ: and the pass. part. ns. are ↓ مَرْيِىٌّ and
↓ مُرَىٌّ, each applied to a banner. (T.)

رَيَّيْتُ رَآءً I made a ر; (M;) or I wrote a ر. (TA

أَرْيَيْتُ الرَّايَةَ; accord. to Lh, أَرْأَيْتُهَا, [and so
in the K, (see 1 in art. رأى, near the end of the
paragraph,]) but [ISd says,] I hold that this is
anomalous, and that it is properly only أَرْيَيْتُهَا; I
stuck, or fixed, [into the ground,] the banner, or
standard. (M, TA.)

Sb on the authority of Abu-l-Khattáb, the ا of
رَايَةٌ, though a substitute for the medial radical,
[i. e. ى,] being likened by him to the augmentative ا, and therefore the final radical is made ء,

banner, or standard, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) of an
army: (Msb:) accord. to some, (Msb,) originally with ء, [see رَأْيَةٌ, in art. رأى,] though
