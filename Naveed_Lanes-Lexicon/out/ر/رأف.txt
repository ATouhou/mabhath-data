رأف1
رَؤُفَ بِهِ, (AZ, T, S, M, O, K,) aor.
رَاُ^َ; (AZ,
T, S, O;) and رَأَفَ, (AZ, T, S, M, K,) aor.
رَاَ^َ;
(AZ, T, S;) and رَئِفَ; (AZ, S, M, O, K;) inf. n.
رَأْفَةٌ and رَآفَةٌ (AZ, T, S, M, O, K) and رَأَفٌ (AZ,
S, K) and رَأْفٌ, (O,) the first and second being
inf. ns. of رَؤُفَ, [or the first is of رَأَفَ,] and the
third being inf. n. of رَئِفَ, (AZ, S, O,) and the
fourth being of رَأَفَ; (O;) said of God, (K,) and
of a man; (AZ, T, S;) [He pitied, or compassionated, him: or he pitied him, or compassionated him, tenderly; or in the utmost
degree; or most tenderly: for] رَأَفْةٌ is syn. with
رَحْمَةٌ: (Fr, T, M, K: *) or it denotes a more
special and more tender affection than رَحْمَةٌ; (T;)
or the utmost degree thereof; (S, K;) or the
most tender thereof: (K:) and رَافَ [in the CK
رَأَفَ, as before, and in Freytag's Lex. رَاءَفَ,] and
رَاوَفَ signify the same: (K:) [the right reading
here appears to be رَافَ; (for it is said in the K in
art. روف that رَافَ, aor. يَرَافُ, is a dial. var. of
رَأَفَ, aor. يَرْأَفُ;) and رَاوَفَ is-doubtful; (for it is
not there mentioned;)] or رَافَ, inf. n. رَوْفٌ, signifies سَكَنَ [he, or it, was, or became, still, &c.];
and رَأَفَ is a dial. var. thereof [signifying thus];
and is not from رَؤُوفٌ syn. with رَحِيمٌ. (M in
art. روف.)
رَأْفٌ (M, O, K) and ↓ رَائِفٌ and ↓ رَئِفٌ (K) and
↓ رَؤُوفٌ [which is the most common of all] and
↓ رَؤُفٌ (T, S, M, O, K) are epithets from the
verbs above: (T, S, M, K:) [the first from رَؤُفَ,
like ضَخْمٌ from ضَخُمٌ; the second from رَأَفَ; and
the third from رَئِفَ; signifying Exercising, or
having, the affection termed رَأْفَة, i. e. pity, or
compassion; &c.; pitying, or compassionating;
&c.; or pitiful, or compassionate; &c.: the fourth
and fifth having an intensive signification; very
pitiful or compassionate, &c.: or] the first and
fourth and fifth all signify the same, i. q. رَحيمٌ:
(K:) [and ↓ أَرْأَفِىٌّ has a similar (most probably
an intensive) signification; as appears from what
here follows:] in the saying [of a poet],
وَ كَانَ ذُو العَرْشِ بِنَا أَرَافِى
[app. meaning And the Lord of the empyrean
was, or is, to us, very merciful], by the last word
is meant أَرْأَفِيًّا, [أَرْأَفِىٌّ being] like أَحْمَرِىٌّ [and
أَرْيَحِىٌّ, q. v.]. (M.)
-A2-  رَأْفٌ also signifies Wine;
(O, K;) and رَافٌ is a dial. var. thereof. (TA in
art. روف.)
رَؤُفٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
رَئِفٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
رَؤُوفٌ: see رَأْفٌ. ―
-b2-  الرَّؤُوفٌ is one of the epithets
applied to God; meaning الرَّحِيمٌ [The Merciful:
or rather it has an intensive signification, i. e.
The Very Merciful]. (T.)
رَائِفٌ: see رَأْفٌ.
أَرْأَفِىٌّ: see رَأْفٌ.
