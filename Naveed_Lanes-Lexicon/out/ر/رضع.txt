first, (Msb, TA,) and رَضْعٌ, (S, Msb, K,) of the

(Msb,) and رِضَاعَةٌ; (K;) or the last two are
simple substs. form رَضَاعٌ; (IAth;) said of a child;
(S, Msb;) He sucked the breast of his mother;
(K;) and ↓ ارتضع signifies the same. (Msb, TA.)
You say, هٰذَا أَخِى مِنَ الرَّضَاعَةِ [This is my
foster-brother]; and هٰذَا رَضِيعِى. (S, K. *) The
saying, in a trad., الرَّضَاعَةُ مِنَ المَجَاعَةِ, and
الرِّضَاعَةُ, means The sucking which occasions interdiction of marriage [with the woman whose
milk is sucked and certain of her relations] is
that of an infant when hungry; not of a child
that is grown up: (IAth:) or that consequent
upon hunger which is stopped by the milk in the
time of infancy of the child; not when the child's
hunger is only to be stopped by solid food. (Mgh
in art. جوع.) You also say, of a man, يَرْضَعُ إِبِلَهُ
(S, K) and غَنَمَهُ (S) [He sucks the teats of his
camels and of his ewes or she-goats, by reason of
his sordidness: see رَاضِعٌ]. ―

i. e. he was born in meanness, sordidness, or ignobleness. (TA.) ―
-b3-  يَرْضَعُ النَّاسَ (assumed tropical:)  He begs of men;
(K, TA;) asks gifts of them. (TA.) So, accord.
to IAar, in the saying of Jereer,
وَيَرْضَعُ مَنْ لَا قَى وَإِنْ يَرَ مُقْعَدًا
يَقُودُ بِأَعْمَى فَالْفَرَزْدَقُ سَائلُهْ
[And he begs of him whom he meets; and if he
see a cripple leading a blind person, El-Farezdak
asks of him]: but [properly speaking] the مُقعَد
is one who cannot stand, so as to lead the blind.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  هُوَ يَرْضَعُ الدُّنْيَا وَيَذُمُّهَا (tropical:)  [He sucks the
sweets of the present world, and dispraises it].
(TA.)
-A2-  رَضُعَ, (S, Z, K,) with damm, as though
what the verb denotes were natural to the person
of whom it is said, (S, TA,) or the verb has this
form because it is changed in meaning so as to be
intensive, (Z, TA,) aor.
رَضُعَ; and رَضَعَ, aor.
رَضِعَ; (Ibn-
'Abbád, K;) inf. n., (Z, K,) of the former verb,
(Z, TA,) رَضَاعَةً, (Z, K,) with fet- h only; (IAth,
TA;) (tropical:)  He (a man, S) was, or became, mean,
sordid, or ignoble: (S, * K, TA:) or he was, or
became, very mean, &c.: (Z, TA:) [see رَاضَعٌ:]
or one says, لَؤُمَ وَرَضُعَ, for the sake of mutual
resemblance; and the meaning is, [he was, or
became, mean, sordid, or ignoble, and] he sucked
from the teat of the she-camel, fearing lest, if he
milked, any one should know of his doing so, and
demand of him somewhat. (Msb.)
-A3-  رَضَعَتْ أَلْبَانُهَا
(tropical:)  Their milk became little in quantity; said in
reference to milch-camels abounding with milk.
(TA. [But the context in the TA suggests that
this is a mistake; that the phrase is said of the
wind called رَضَاعَةٌ; and that the right reading is
رَضَعَتْ أَلْبَانَهَا; and the meaning, (assumed tropical:)  It rendered
their milk little in quantity.])
3
راضعهُ, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. مُرَاضَعَةٌ and رِضَاعٌ
(Msb, K, TA) and also رِضَاعَةٌ, (Msb,) [but this
last is anomalous, and, if correct, is probably
a simple subst.,] He sucked with him; or had
him sucking with him; (Msb, * K, * TA;) he had
him as his رَضِيع [or foster-brother]. (Msb.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] بَيْنَهُمَا رِضَاعُ الكَأْسِ (tropical:)  [Between them two
is the sipping of the wine-cup, or cup of wine].
(TA.) ―
-b3-  مُرَاضَعَةٌ also signifies An infant's sucking the breast of his mother while she has a child
in her belly. (K.)
-A2-  راضع ابْنَهُ He gave, or delivered, his son to the woman who should suckle
him. (S, K.) [See also 4.]

she suckled. (K.) ―
-b2-  ذَاتُ إِرْضَاعٍ, also, signifies
(assumed tropical:)  Having milk, though not having a child that is
suckled. (IB.)
-A2-  أَرْضْعَتْهُ أُمُّهُ His mother suckled
him. (S, Msb, K. *) ―
-b2-  You say also, أَرْضَعَ الوَلَدَ
[app. meaning He caused the child to be suckled:
or, perhaps, he suckled the child, by means of his
wife or a female slave; because his semen genitale
is considered as the source of the milk of a woman
who has borne him a child; accord. to a saying
of Lth, cited in an explanation of a usage of the
word لَقَاحٌ or لِقَاحٌ]. (K voce مَلَحَ, q. v.) [See
also 3.]
6
تراضعا They both sucked the breast of a
woman together; each with the other. (TA.)
8
ارتضع: see 1; first sentence. ―
-b2-  ارتضعت
العَنْزُ The she-goat drank [or sucked] her own
milk [from her udder]. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  Hence اِرْتِضَاعُ
الكَأْسِ (assumed tropical:)  The drinking [of the cup] of wine. (Har
p. 284: [See also 3.])
10
استرضع He sought, or demanded, a wetnurse. (K.) It is said in the Kur [ii. 233],
وَإِنْ أَرَدْتُمْ أَنْ تَسْتَرْضِعُوا أَوْلَادَكُمْ And if ye desire
to seek, or demand, wet-nurses for your children;
i. e., ان تسترضعوا اولادكم مَرَاضِعَ; the second
objective complement [accord. to this order of the
words], but the first in reality because the wetnurse is the agent with respect to the child, being
suppressed; for you say, اِسْتَرْضَعْتُ المَرْأَةَ وَلَدِى,
meaning I sought, or demanded, of the woman
that she should suckle my child: (IB:) accord.
to some, the verb is doubly trans.: accord. to
others, the prep. لِ is suppressed in the Kur;
the meaning being لِأَوْلَادِكُمْ. (El-Howfee, in the
“ Burhán fee tefseer-el-Kur-án. ”)
رِضْعٌ A kind of trees upon which camels feed.
(O, K.)
رَضَعٌ The young ones [or suckers] of palmtrees; (IAar, K;) as also رَصَعٌ, (K,) accord. to
Lth and IDrd and the S; (TA in art. رصع;) or
the latter, accord. to Az, is a mistranscription:
(K * and TA in that art.:) n. un. with ة. (TA.)
-A2-  (tropical:)  Meanness, sordidness, or ignobleness; a subst.
from رَضُعَ; as also ↓ رَضِعٌ. (K.)
رَضِعٌ: see رَاضِعٌ, in two places:
-A2- : and see رَضَعٌ.
رَضِيعٌ A foster-brother; syn. ↓ مُرَاضَعٌ: pl. رُضَعَآءُ
(TA.) You say, هٰذَا رَضِيعِى, (S, Msb, * K, *) i. e.
هٰذَا أَخِى مِنَ الرَّضَاعَةِ [This is my foster-brother].
(S, K. *) ―
-b2-  [A child while it is a suckling;] a
child before it is termed فَطِيمٌ [i. e. weaned].
(IAar, TA in art. طبخ. [See also رَاضَعٌ.]) [In
explanations of the words وَطْبٌ and شَكْوَةٌ in the
S, it is applied as an epithet to a kid, evidently
as meaning Sucking; or a suckling; like رَاضِعٌ,
q. v., and رَضِعٌ.] ―
-b3-  See two other significations,
voce رَاضَغٌ, in two places.
رَضَاعَةٌ, said in the K to be an inf. n. of 1 in the
first of the senses explained in this art., is, accord.
to IAth, a simple subst. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [It is a regular
inf. n. of رَضُعَ, q. v.]
-A2-  الرَّضَاعَةُ also signifies
(tropical:)  The [west wind, or westerly wind, called] دَبُور:
or a wind between that and the [south wind, or
southerly wind, called] جَنُوب: (IDrd, K, TA:)
because, when it blows upon the milch-camels
abounding with milk, their milk becomes little in
quantity. (IDrd, TA.)
رِضَاعَةٌ, said in the K to be an inf. n. of 1 in the
first of the senses expl. in this art., is, accord. to
IAth, a simple subst. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [It is also said,
in the Msb, to be an inf. n. of رَاضَعَهُ, q. v.]
رَضُوعَةٌ A female that suckles her young: (TA:)
or a ewe or she-goat that suckles, or that has a
young one which she suckles. (AO, S, K.)
رَضَّاعٌ: see the next paragraph.
رَاضَعٌ Sucking the breast of his mother; a
suckling; as also ↓ رَضِعٌ: pl. of the former رُضَّعٌ;
and of the latter; رُضُعٌ. (K. [See also رَضِيعٌ, which
signifies the same; as is shown below, voce
مُرْضِعٌ; and by Bd in xxii. 2; &c.]) ―
-b2-  One who
sucks from the teat of the she-camel, fearing lest,
if he milked, any one should know of his doing
so, and demand of him somewhat: (Msb:) or a
pastor who does not take with him a milkingvessel, and, when he is asked for milk, excuses
himself on that ground, (K, TA,) and, when he
desires to drink, sucks the teat of his milchbeast: (TA:) pl. رُضَّعٌ. (Msb.) The phrase
لَئِيمٌ رَاضِعٌ [i. e. Mean, sordid, or ignoble; who
sucks the teats of his she-camels, &c.,] originated,
(S, K,) as they assert, (S,) from a certain man's
sucking the teats of his she-camels (S, K) or ewes
or she-goats, and not milking them, (S,) lest the
sound of his milking should be heard and somewhat should be demanded of him: (S, K:) or
the origin was the coming of a guest by night to
a certain man of the Amalekites, whereupon the
latter sucked the udder of his ewe, lest the guest
should hear the sound of the streaming of the
milk from the teat. (IDrd.) But when a single
epithet is used, one says ↓ رَضِيعٌ. (Msb. [See,
however, what follows.]) ―
-b3-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  Mean,
sordid, or ignoble; (K, TA;) as also ↓ رَضِيعٌ and
↓ رَضَّاعٌ: pl. رُضَّعٌ and رُضَّاعٌ: (K:) and رَضِعُونَ, as
a pl., [i. e. pl. of ↓ رَضِعٌ,] has the same signification, of mean, &c. (TA.) It is said in a trad. of
Selemeh Ibn-El-Akwa', اليُوْمَ يُوْمُ الرُّضَّعِ, meaning (tropical:)  To-day is the day of the destruction of the
mean, &c. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Also (tropical:)  Mean, sordid, or
ignoble, who has sucked meanness, sordidness, or
ignobleness, from the breast of his mother; (ElYemámee, K, TA;) i. e. born in meanness, sordidness, or ignobleness. (TA.) ―
-b5-  (tropical:)  A beggar: (TA:)
one who begs of men: (K:) thus Ibn-'Abbád
explains لَئِيمٌ رَاضِعٌ. (TA.) ―
-b6-  (assumed tropical:)  One who eats the
particles of food remaining between his teeth, lest
anything [thereof] should escape him: (K:) or
such is termed لَئِيمٌ رَاضِعٌ. (TA.)
-A2-  A possessor
of milk: after the usual manner of a possessive
epithet [like لَابِنٌ]. (TA.)
رَاضِعَةٌ A central incisor when it falls out:
(Msb:) or the رَاضِعَتَانِ are the two central incisors (S, Msb, K, TA) of a child, (S K, TA,)
over which the milk is drunk [or sucked]: (Msb,
TA:) pl. رَوَاضَعُ: (S, Msb, K:) or the رَوَاضِع
are the teeth of a child that grow and then fall
out in the period of sucking; (Msb, * TA;) and
they are said to be six in the upper part of the
mouth and six in its lower part: (TA:) [the pl.
is applied to all the milk-teeth of a child, and of a
horse &c.; it applies to the teeth called رَبَاعِيَات
that fall out, as well as to the ثَنَايَا, or central
incisors, accord. to AO, in a passage relating to a
colt, in his كتاب الخيل quoted in the TA in art.
حفر; and to the teeth called قَوَارِح that fall out,
accord. to a passage in the S, voce أَحْفَرَ, q. v., as
well as the extract from the work of AO mentioned above, and in this case likewise relating to
a colt.]
مَرْضَعٌ The breast, as being the place of sucking:
pl. مَرَاضِعُ. (Ksh and Bd in xxviii. 11.) ―
-b2-  And
[as an inf. n.] The act of sucking the breast: pi.
as above. (Ksh and Bd ibid.)
مُرْضَعٌ Suckled: pl. مَرَاضَعُ; which is opposed
to فُطُمٌ, pl. of فَطِيمٌ. (Mgh.)
مُرْضِعٌ and مُرْضَعَةٌ A mother [or other woman]
suckling: (Msb:) or one having with her a child
which she suckles: the former epithet may with
reason be applied to the mother because suckling
is performed only by females, like as the epithets
حَائِضٌ and طَامِثٌ are applied to a woman; and
if مُرْضَعَةٌ were applied to her who has with her a
child, it would be correct: (Fr, TA:) [but see
another saying ascribed to Fr in what follows:]
or the former, a woman having a child which she
suckles; (Kh, S, IB, K;) after the manner of a
possessive epithet; (IB;) i. e. having a رَضِيع;
(Kh, IB;) like اِمْرَأَةٌ مُطْفِلٌ “ a woman having
a طِفْل; ” (Kh;) or ظَبْيَةٌ مُشْدِنٌ “ a doe-gazelle
having a شَادِن; ” though مُرْضِعٌ has a verb bearing a signification agreeing with this; and it
sometimes occurs as meaning having milk, though
not having a child that is suckled: (IB:) but
the latter is used in describing a woman as performing an action; (Kh;) signifying suckling a
child: (S, K:) the former is used when the
[abstract] quality is meant: the latter, when the
action is meant: but God knows: (Akh:) or the
former signifies one who is near to suckling, but
has not yet suckled: and one having with her the
child that is suckled [by her] (الصَّبِىُّ الرَّضِيعُ):
and the latter, [in the TA the former, but this is
a mistranscription, as is shown by what follows,]
one who is suckling, her teat being in the mouth
of her child; and in this sense it is used in the
Kur, in a passage which see below: (AZ in the
TA:) Th says, the latter signifies one who suckles,
though she have not a child, or if she have a
child: and the former, one who has not a child
with her, and sometimes having with her a child:
and in one place he says, when the action is
meant, the latter is used, and it is made an
epithet: and when the ة is not added, it is meant
as a subst: (TA:) Fr and some others say that
it is without ة when the proper signification of
suckling is meant: and with ة when the tropical
signification of a subject of the attribute of
suckling in time past or future is meant: (Msb:)
the pl. [of both, though said in the Mgh and TA
to be that of the former,] is مَرَاضِعُ (Mgh, Msb,
TA) and مَرَاضِيعُ. (Msb, TA.) The saying in the
Kur [xxii. 2], يَوْمَ تَرَوْنَهَا تَذْهَلُ كُلُّ مُرْضِعَةٍ عَمَّا
أَرْضَعَتْ means [On the day when ye shall see it,]
every woman that is suckling;, (AZ, Kh,) in the
act of doing so, (Kh,) with her teat in the mouth
of her child; (AZ,) [shall neglect, or become heedless of or diverted from, that which she shall have
been suckling:] or مرضعة here has the last signification explained in the preceding sentence [so that
the meaning is every woman who shall have been
suckling or shall be going to suckle]. (Msb.) ―
-b2-
It is said in a trad., نِعْمَتِ المُرْضِعَةُ وَبِئْسَتِ الفَاطِمَةُ,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Excellent in the office of commander,
or governor, and the profit, or advantage, which
it brings to its possessor; and very evil is death,
which destroys his delights, or pleasures, and stops
the profits, or advantages, of that office. (TA.)
―
-b3-  The pl. مَرَاضِيعُ is metaphorically applied as
an epithet to bees (جَوَارِس, i. e. نَحْل). (TA.)
مُرَاضَعٌ: see رَضِيعٌ. ―
-b2-  Also An unborn child of a
woman who is suckling another child: such a
child proves to be meagre in body, slender in the
bones, and ill nourished. (En-Nadr, Sgh.)
مُسْتَرْضَعٌ [for مُسْتَرْضَعٌ لَهُ, agreeably with an opinion mentioned by El-Howfee, (see 10,) One for
whom a wet-nurse has been sought, or demanded].
You say, فُلَانٌ المُسْتَرْضَعُ فِى بَنِى تَمِيمٍ [Such a
one is he for whom a wet-nurse has been sought,
or demanded, among the Benoo-Temeem]. (TA.)
