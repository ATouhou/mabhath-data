رَفُقَ, (S, Msb,)
inf. n. رِفْقٌ (S, * O, Mgh, * Msb, * K) and مَرْفِقٌ and
مِرْفَقٌ (AZ, O, K,) and مَرْفَقٌ; (O, K;) and رَفِقَ,
(JK, O, K,) [aor.
رَفَقَ,] inf. n. رَفَقٌ; (JK;) and رَفُقَ;

(AZ, O, K.) Hence the saying of the Prophet,
مَنْ رَفَقَ بِأُمَّتِى رَفَقَ اللّٰهُ بِهِ [He who is gentle, &c.,
with my people, God will be gentle, &c., with
him]. (O.) [Hence, also,] one says, ↓ ترفّق
فِى أَمْرِهِ [and رَفَقَ فِيهِ as is indicated in the O] He
used gentleness, or acted gently, in his affair;
syn. تَأَتَّى. (Msb in art. اتى.) And لِحَاجَتِهِ ↓ ترفّق
He applied himself with gentleness to his needful
affair or business; syn. تَأَتَّى. (T in art. اتى.)
And لِلْأَمْرِ ↓ ترفّق He applied himself with gentle

(O.) [And accord. to the TK, one says, رَفُقَ بِهِ,

لِينُ جَانِبٍ and لَطَافَةُ فِعْلٍ; and so ↓ رَفَقٌ; (JK;)
and ↓ رَافِقَةٌ likewise; whence the phrase أَوْلَى
فُلَانًا رَافِقَةً [He treated such a one with gentleness,
&c.]. (JK, IDrd, O.) It is also explained as
meaning Good submission to that which conduces
to what is comely, or pleasing. (TA.) ―

orifices of the teats, (O,) of a she-camel: (O, K:)
so says Zeyd Ibn-Kuthweh: (O:) or a disorder

badly milked, or of the milker's not shaking the
teat to remove what remained in it, so that the
milk reverts into the udder, and turns to blood,
or becomes coagulated and mixed with yellow
water. (K. [Perhaps in this sense, also, an
inf. n.: see 1, last sentence.])

authority of Ibn-Tal-hah ↓ رُفَاقَةٌ, (K, [in which this
last is said to be like ثُمَامَةُ, to indicate that it is
with damm to the ر, but not (as will be shown
below, voce رَفِيقٌ,) that it is without tenween,
imperfectly decl., and determinate like الرُّفْقَةُ,])
Persons travelling, or journeying, together;
(Mgh;) a company of persons [travelling, or

is also pl. of رُفْقَةٌ,] and [of pauc.] أَرْفَاقٌ; (O, K;)
and the pl. of رِفْقَةٌ is رِفَقٌ: (Msb:) or رُفْقَةٌ is a

in a pl. sense; and its pl. is رِفَقٌ and رُفَقٌ and
[quasi-pl. n.] ↓ رَفَقٌ. (K.) [Golius explains the
first and second and third, as on the authority of
the KL, by the words “ consortium, societas: ”
but in my copy of the KL, I find only the first

words گروه همراهان, agreeably with the renderings
which I have given above.] ―
-b2-  The pl. رِفَاقٌ also
signifies Camels upon which people have gone
forth to purvey for themselves wheat, or corn, or

the saying of Bishr, (S,) i. e. of Bishr Ibn-Abee-
Házim, (O,)
فَإِنِّى وَالشَّكَاةَ مِنَ الِ لَأْىٍ
كَذَاتِ الضِغْنِ تَمْشِى فِى الرِّفَاقِ
(O,) or وَآلَ لَامٍ, (S, O,) accord. to different readings: (O:) [i. e. And verily I, with respect to
the fault, or the complaint, of the family of Läy,
or and the family of Lám, am like her that
yearns towards, or longs for, her home, or accustomed place, going along with her arm and shank
in the رفاق]: he says, I am withheld from satirizing them, like as this she-camel that yearns
towards, or longs for, her home, or accustomed
place, is bound and withheld; but if they do not
what I approve, I will let loose my tongue with
satirizing them. (O.) ―
-b2-  Also A thing in form
like a finger, made for the teat of a she-camel
when she is affected with the [disorder termed]
رَفَق: it is stuffed with dates, and then the صِرَار
[q. v.] is bound over it, in order that it [the teat]
may be cured. (JK.)
رَفِيقٌ Gentle, soft, tender, gracious, courteous,

or thing, is easy, or convenient, to thee: see
أَرْفَقُ]. (O.)
-A2-  Also A companion (JK, S, O,
Msb, K) and companions (JK, S, O, K) in travel-ling, or journeying, and afterwards: (Kh, S, O,
Msb, K:) used as sing. and pl., (JK, S, O, K,)
like صَدِيقٌ (S, O) and خَلِيطٌ: (O:) pl. رُفَقَآءُ;
(JK, S, O, K;) with which ↓ رُفَاقَةٌ is syn., as in
the phrase فِتْيَةٌ رُفَاقَةٌ [Young men companions &c.].
(JK.) See also رُفْقَةٌ. It is said in the Kur [iv. 71],
وَحَسُنَ أُولَائِكَ رَفِيقًا, (JK, S, O,) meaning رُفَقَآءَ
[i. e. And good, or very good, will be those as
companions after the journey of life] in Paradise!
(JK.) And Mohammad is related by 'Áïsheh to
have said, [just before his death,] when he had
been given his choice between continuance in the
present world and what was with God, and had
chosen the latter, بَلِ الرَّفِيقَ الأَعْلَى مِنَ الجَنَّةِ
[Nay, rather, the highest companions of Paradise]; meaning, I desire the company, or congregation, of the prophets. (O.)
رُفَاقَةٌ: see رُفْقَةٌ and رَفِيقٌ.
رَافِقٌ: see رَفِيقٌ, in two places.
رَافِقَةٌ: see رِفْقٌ.
أَرْفَقُ [compar. and superl. of رَفِيقٌ; meaning
More, and most, gentle, &c.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,] one
says, هٰذَا الأَمْرُ أَرْفَقُ بِكَ [and عَلَيْكَ] (assumed tropical:)  This affair,
or thing, is more, or most, easy, or convenient, to
thee. (TA in art. عود.) [See also an instance
voce مَحْنِيَةٌ (in art. حنو), last sentence.]
-A2-  Also,
applied to a camel, Having the elbow (المِرْفَق)
distorted from the side: (JK, S, O, K:) so says
Lth: (O:) and so the fem. رَفْقَآءُ, applied to a
she-camel: (JK, S:) but Az says that the epithet
preserved by him in his memory as heard from
the Arabs applied to a camel is أَدْفَقُ, with دال.
(O.) ―
-b2-  Accord. to As, (O,) رَفْقَآءُ applied to a
she-camel signifies Having the orifice of her teat
stopped up; (O, K;) and so ↓ رَفِقَةٌ: (K:) the
latter is said by Zeyd Ibn-Kuthweh to signify, so
applied, having the orifices of her teats stopped
up. (O.)
مَرْفَقٌ: see مِرْفَقٌ, in two places.
مَرْفِقٌ: see what next follows, in three places.

which ↓ مَرْفَقٌ also is an inf. n. (O, K.) ―
-b2-  Also
A thing by which one profits, or gains advantage
or benefit. (S, O, Msb, K.) It is said in the Kur
[xviii. 15], وَيُهَيِّئُ لَكُمْ مِنْ أَمْرِكُمْ مِرْفَقًا or ↓ مَرْفِقًا,
accord. to different readers, [i. e. And He will
prepare for you a condition of your case by
which ye shall profit], but no one reads ↓ مَرْفَقًا,
(S, O,) which, however, is allowable, meaning
↓ رِفْقًا. (S. [See رِفْقٌ, last sentence.]) The pl. is
مَرَافِقُ. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  [Hence,] مَرَافِقُ الدَّارِ Such appertenances [or conveniences] of the house as the
privy and the kitchen and the like: (Mgh, Msb:)
or the sinks, and the like, of the house: (S, O, K:)
and particularly privies: (O:) when used in these
senses, the sing. is مِرْفَقٌ only, with kesr to the
م and fet-h to the ف, (Mgh, Msb,) likened to
the noun signifying an instrument. (Msb.) [See
also حَيِّزٌ, in art. حوز.] ―
-b4-  And from the same
words in the sense expl. in the second sentence
above, (Msb,) مِرْفَقٌ and ↓ مَرْفِقٌ signify also The
elbow, or elbow-joint; the place where the ذِرَاع
joins upon the عَضُد; (S, O, K;) [in other words,]
the place where the عَضُد is connected with the
سَاعِد; (Mgh;) the مرفق of a man: (Msb:) [and
in like manner in a beast, the elbow, or elbowjoint, as in the JK, S, O, and K, voce أَرْفَقُ;
and in countless other instances: but in the K
voce رُكْبَةٌ (q. v.), it seems to be applied to the
knee of a beast:] pl. as above. (Msb.)
مِرْفَقَةٌ A pillow (S, O, Mgh, K) upon which one
leans [with the elbow]: from مِرْفَقٌ in the sense

شَاةٌ مُرَفَّقَةٌ A sheep, or goat, having the fore
legs white to the elbows. (O, K.)

side. (O, K.) ―

by the صِرَار [q. v.] when her udder is bound therewith, and from whom blood issues (JK, O, K)
when she is loosed [therefrom] (إِذَا حُلَّتْ), (JK,)
or when she is milked (اذا حُلِبَتْ). (O, K.)
مَرْفُوقٌ A camel having a complaint of his مِرْفَق
[or elbow]. (IDrd, O, K.)
مُرْتَفَقٌ A place, or thing, upon which one leans
[properly with the مِرْفَق, or elbow]. (Bd in xviii.
28 and 30.)
مُرْتَفِقٌ Leaning upon his elbow. (S, O.)
-A2-
Also Full, standing, and continuing, or remaining: (O, K:) or nearly full: so explained by
IAar as occurring in the following verse of 'Obeyd
Ibn-El-Abras, (O,) describing rain that had filled
the low tracts of ground: (TA in art. صوح:)
فَأَصْبَحَ الرَّوْضُ وَالقِيعَانُ مُمْرِعَةً
مِنْ بَيْنِ مُرْتَفِقٍ مِنْهَا وَمُنْصَاحِ
[And the meadows, and the plain, or soft, low
tracts, became abundant with herbage, partly by
what was full, &c., in consequence thereof, and
partly by what was flowing, running upon the
surface of the ground]: (O:) or, as some relate
it, مُتْرَعَةً [i. e. “ filled ”]; and مُرْتَتِقٍ, which means
herbage “ of which the blossoms have not yet
come forth from their calyxes; ” and مُنْصَاح
[accord. to this reading] meaning herbage “ of
which the blossoms have appeared: ” (TA in art.
صوح:) [or, accord. to the reading مُرْتَتِقٍ, the
meaning may be, “partly such as were compact
thereof,” i. e. of the meadows &c., “and partly
such as were cracked ” by the heat and drought:]
another reading is
مِنْ بَيْنِ مُرْتَفِقٍ مِنْهَا وَمِنْ طَاحِى
من طاحى meaning “ of what was flowing and
going away. ” (TA ubi suprà.)
[Nearly the whole of this art. is wanting in the
copies of the TA to which I have had access.]
