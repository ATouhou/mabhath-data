dir el-Aaráb,” ترخم صَبِيَّهَا and ترخم عَلَيْهِ, [app.

thereof; (K;) i. e. the [abbreviating by the]
eliding of the end thereof, for the alleviation of
the utterance; (Msb;) the curtailing a name of
its last letter, or more; (S, TA;) as when, to one
whose name is حَارِثٌ or مَالِكٌ, you say يَا حَارِ or
يَامَالِ: but accord. to Z, in the A, it is from the
ترخيم of the hen; because this is only on the
occasion of the cutting short (قَطْع) [of the laying]
of the eggs: (TA:) [in like manner also] the
تَرْخِيم of the diminutive is the [abbreviating
thereof by the] cutting off of [one or more of]
the augmentative letters [and sometimes of radical letters]; as when, in forming the diminutive
of أَسْوَدُ [and that of إِبْرَاهِيمُ], one says سُوَيْدٌ [and

i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [upon whom] the love and familiarity of his
mother [have been made to fall or light, or have
been bestowed], is an explanation given by As of
the pass. part. n. ↓ مَرْخُومٌ. (S, TA.) [But accord.
to Z, these significations are from رَخَمَةٌ as signifying a bird of a certain species described in what
follows: for] it is said in the A that أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ
↓ رَخَمَةً means (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, affectionate,
or pitiful, or compassionate, to him, and attached
to him: because the رَخَمَة is vehemently voracious,
and fond of alighting upon carcasses: therefore
love and affection lighting upon one are likened
thereto. (TA.)

the pl. [properly so termed] of رَخَمَةٌ is رُخْمٌ [like
as بُدْنٌ is of بَدَنَةٌ, or perhaps of رَخَمٌ, like as
أُسْدٌ is of أَسَدٌ,] (JK, TA) and also ↓رُخَمٌ [which
is anomalous]: (JK:) the ↓ رَخَمَة is a partycoloured bird, white and black, (S, TA,) resembling the نَسْر (JK, S, TA) in form; and also
called أَنُوقٌ: (S, TA:) [it is said to be] a bird
that eats human dung, a foul bird, not of such as
are pursued as game, wherefore no expiation is
incumbent on him who kills it when he is in the
state of إِحْرَام, for it is not eaten: it is [said to be]
thus called because it is too weak to take prey:
(Msb:) [various fanciful uses of its gall-bladder
and flesh &c. for medicinal and other purposes are
described in the K: accord. to some, if not all,
it is a term for the female: (see أَنُوقٌ:)] the male

فَرَسٌ نَاتِىءُ الرخمةِ [A horse having the رخمة protuberant]. (TA.) [If correctly written in the
JK, it is probably a n. un. of which رَخَمٌ is the
coll. gen. n.: and hence, perhaps,] وَرْهَآءُ الرَّخَمِ,
applied by the poet ' Amr Dhu-l-Kelb to a ewe
abounding with milk, as meaning Soft [in the
