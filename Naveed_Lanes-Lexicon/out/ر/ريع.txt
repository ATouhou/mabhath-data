ريع1
رَاعَ, aor. يَرِيعُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. رَيْعٌ (S,
Mgh, Msb, K) and رُيُوعٌ (TA) and رِيَاعٌ (Lh, TA)
and رَيَعَانٌ, (TA,) It increased, or augmented; (S,
Mgh, Msb, K;) said of wheat and other things:
or, as some say, it denotes زِيَادَة [i. e. it signifies
it became redundant, or it exceeded, as will be
seen in what follows; but the truth is, that it has
both of these significations; the latter] in relation to flour, and to bread. (TA.) You say,
رَاعَتِ الحِنْطَةُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor. تَرِيعُ, inf. n. رَيْعٌ
[&c.]; (Msb;) and ↓ أَرَاعَت, (S, K,) which latter
is said by Az to be more commonly used than the
former; (TA;) and الطَّعَامُ ↓ رَيَّعَ [which is the
same as رَيَّعَتِ الحِنْطَةُ]; (TA;) The wheat increased, or augmented; or received increase and
blessing from God; or throve by the blessing of
God: (S, Msb, K, TA:) and in like manner one
says of other things. (Msb.) And رَاعَتِ الشَّجَرَةُ,
and ↓ اراعت, but the former is rare, The tree
became abundant in its produce, or fruit. (AHn.)
And sometimes they said, (S,) الإِبِلُ ↓ اراعت (S,
IF, K) (tropical:)  The camels had many young ones; (S;)
they increased, and had many young ones. (IF, K.)
One says also, رَاعَ الطَّعَامُ, and ↓ اراع, The wheat
became redundant; or had a part, or portion,
redundant; [app. meaning, over and above the
original measure;] in the kneading and the
making of bread; syn. صَارَ لَهُ زِيَادَةٌ. (S.) [See
the first sentence above; and see رَيْعٌ, below.]
And رَاعَ فِى يَدِى كَذَا Such a thing was redundant, or remained over and above, in my
hand; as also رَاقَ; syn. زَادَ: (L in this art., and
TA in art. روع:) Sgh has mistranscribed the explanation, زاد, in his two books, [the TS and the
O,] writing فَادَ; and the author of the K has
imitated him in mentioning this in art. روع, instead
of the present art., which is its proper place, but
has written for the explanation أَفَادَ. (TA.)
-A2-
رَاعَ, aor. يَرِيعُ, (IDrd, S, K,) inf. n. رَيْعٌ, (S, TA,)
He, or it, returned; went, or came, back; reverted: (IDrd, S, K:) and رَاعَ, aor. يَرُوعُ, (IDrd,
and K in art. روع,) inf. n. رُوَاعٌ, (K in that art.,)
signifies the same; (IDrd, and K in art. روع;) or
it returned to its place: (TA in that art.:) but
the former verb is the more common. (TA in
the present art.) One says, of camels that have
run away, صَاحَ عَلَيْهَا الرَّاعِى فَرَاعَتْ إِلَيْهِ [The
pastor cried out at them, and] they returned to
him. (TA.) And وَعَظْتُهُ فَأَبِى أَنْ يَرِيعَ [I exhorted him, but he refused] to return, or revert.
(TA.) And فُلَانٌ مَا يَرِيعُ بِكَلَامِكَ وَلا بِصَوْتِكَ Such
a one does not return, or revert, by reason of thy
speech nor by reason of thy voice. (TA.) And
you say of vomit, رَاعَ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ Somewhat of it
returned: (S:) and رَاعَ عَلَيْهِ it returned to his
inside. (TA.) And in like manner one says of
anything that returns to him, رَاعَ, aor. يَرِيعُ.

rent]. (S.)
-A4-  [It is also said that] رَاعَ, aor. يَرِيعُ,

and the like. (K.) Hence it is said, in a trad. of
I'Ab, respecting the expiation of an oath, لِكُلِّ
مِسْكِينٍ مُدٌّ مِنْ حِنْطَةٍ رَيْعُهُ إِدَامُهُ [To every poor
man, a mudd of wheat: the redundance, or redundant part or portion, thereof shall be for its
seasoning]: i. e., it is not necessary for the person
to give, with the mudd, seasoning; but the redundance that shall arise, of the flour, or meal,
of the mudd [of wheat], when he shall have
ground it, therewith shall the seasoning be bought.

العَجِينَ فَإِنَّهُ أَحَدُ الرَّيْعَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  Knead ye well, or
thoroughly, or soundly, the dough; for this action

sense,] (S, K,) (tropical:)  The first (S, K) and most excel-lent (K) part of anything: (S, K:) said in the
B to be a metaphorical application from رَيْعٌ as
signifying a high, or an elevated, place. (TA.)

written ↓ رَيَع, (TA,) or الشَّبَابِ ↓ رَيْعَانُ, (S, A, L,
TA,) (tropical:)  The first, or prime, (S, A, TA,) and most

there is no reply, or answer, to be given]. (K, *
TA.)
-A2-  Also Fright, or fear; (K;) like
رَوْعٌ. (TA.)
رِيعٌ (Fr, S, Msb, K, &c.) and ↓ رَيْعٌ, (Fr, K,)
the former occurring, (S,) or the latter accord. to
one reading, (TA,) in the Kur [xxvi. 128], (S,
TA,) High, or elevated, land or ground: (S, K:)
or a high, or an elevated, place; (so in some
copies of the S and in the Msb;) which latter
signification is also assigned to ↓ رِيعَةٌ; (TA;)
and whence the phrase, كَمْ رِيعُ أَرْضِكَ, meaning
what is the elevation of thy land? [a phrase not
to be mistaken for كَمْ رَيْعُ أَرْضِكَ, in which the
meaning is “ increase: ”] (Az, TA:) or any [road
such as is termed] فَجّ: (K:) or (so accord. to the
Msb and K, but in the S “ and ”) a road (S, Msb,

the first paragraph of art. سمت:]) or a road

some copies of the S, a small mountain: (TA:)
or signifying also a high mountain: (O, K:)
n. of un. with ة [i. e. ↓ رِيعَةٌ, as it is written in the
S; and ↓ رَيْعَةٌ also, as implied in the K]: (S, K:
[in the former immediately following the signification of “ mountain; ” and in the latter, so following that of “ high mountain; ” whence it seems
that رِيعٌ and رَيْعٌ are sometimes used, at least in
one sense, as coll. gen. ns.:]) pl. [of mult.] رِيَاعٌ,
(S, TA,) which is extr., (TA,) and رُيُوعٌ, and [of
pauc.] أَرْيَاعٌ: (TA:) but AO says, contr. to J,
that ↓ رِيعَةٌ is pl. of رِيعٌ: (IB, TA:) or رِيعٌ and
رَيْعٌ signify the channel of the torrent of a valley
from any, or every, high, or elevated, place. (K.)
