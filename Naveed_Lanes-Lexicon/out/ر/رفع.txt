رَفَعَهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.
رَفَعَ, (K, TA,) inf. n.
رَفْعٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) He raised it: [this is generally the best rendering, as it serves to indicate
several particular significations which will be
found explained in what follows:] he elevated it;
upraised it; uplifted it: he took it up: contr. of
خَفَضَهُ: (Msb:) or of وَضَعَهُ: (S, Mgh, K:) as
also ↓ رفّعهُ, (K,) inf. n. تَرْفِيعٌ; (TA;) and ↓ ارتفعهُ;
(K;) for accord. to the “ Nawádir,” you say,
ارتفعهُ بِيَدِهِ and رَفَعَهُ [he raised it, lifted it, heaved
it, or took it up, with his hand]; but Az says
that ارتفع is intrans., and that he has heard no
authority for its being trans., in the sense of رَفَعَ,
except that which he had read in the “ Nawádir
el-Aaráb:” (TA:) رَفْعٌ is sometimes applied to
corporeal things, meaning the raising, or elevating,
a thing from the resting-place thereof: sometimes
to a building, meaning the rearing it, uprearing
it, or making it high or lofty: (Er-Rághib:) or
in relation to corporeal things, it is used properly
to denote motion, and removal: (Msb:) it signifies the putting away or removing or turning back
a thing after the coming or arriving thereof; like
as دَفْعٌ signifies the putting away or removing
or turning back a thing before the coming or
arriving [thereof]: (Kull p. 185:) but in relation
to ideal things, it is [tropically used, as it is also
in many other cases, and] accorded in meaning to
what the case requires. (Msb.) [In its principal
senses, proper and tropical, رَفْعٌ agrees with the
Latin Tollere..] It is said in the Kur [ii. 60 and
87], رَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ We raised above you from
its resting-place the mountain: and in the same
[xii. 2], اَللّٰهُ الَّذِى رَفَعَ السَّمٰوَاتِ بِغَيْرِ عَمَدٍ تَرَوْنَهَا
[God is He who raised the heavens without
pillars that ye see; or, as ye see them]: and in
the same [ii. 121], وَإِذْ يَرْفَعُ إِبْرٰهِيمُ القَوَاعِدَ مِنَ
البَيْتِ [And when Abraham] was rearing or uprearing or making high or lofty [the foundations
of the House of God, at Mekkeh]. (Er-Rághib.)
And you say, اِرْفَعْ هٰذَا Take thou this: (Mgh:)
or take it and carry it [away; or take it up and
remove it]. (TA.) And رَفَعَ الزَّرعَ, (Lh, K,) or
رَفَعَهُ إِلَى البَيْدَرِ, (Msb,) aor.
رَفَعَ, (Lh,) inf. n. رَفْعٌ
(Lh, S) and رِفَاعَةٌ and رِفَاعٌ [perhaps a mistranscription for رَفَاعُ, which see below], (Lh, TA,)
He removed, or transported, the seed-produce
from the place in which he had reaped it, (Lh,)
or carried it after the reaping, (S, K,) to the
place in which the grain was to be trodden out.
(Lh, S, K.) [This last signification is said in the
TA to be tropical; but according to a passage of
the Msb quoted in the first sentence of this art.,
it is proper. In most of the phrases here following, the verb is undoubtedly used tropically.] ―
-b2-
رَفَعُوا إِلَىَّ عُيُونَهُمْ (tropical:)  [They raised towards me their
eyes]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  دَخَلْتُ عَلَى فُلَانٍ فَلَمْ يَرْفَعْ بِى
رَأْسًا (Mgh, TA *) (tropical:)  I went in to such a one, and
he did not look towards me, nor pay any regard,
or attention, to me. (Mgh.) [بِى is not here a
mistake for لِى, for the phrase is often found thus
written.] ―
-b4-  رُفِعَ لِىَ الشَّىْءُ (assumed tropical:)  [The thing was, as
it were, raised into view, i. e. it rose into view, to
me;] I saw the thing from afar. (TA.) ―
-b5-
رَفَعَ السَّرَابُ الشَّخْصَ, aor.
رَفَعَ, inf. n. رَفْعٌ, (tropical:)  The
mirage raised, or elevated [to the eye, (see an ex.
near the end of the first paragraph of art. زول)]
the figure of a man or some other thing seen from
a distance; [or it may be allowable to render it,
made it to appear tall, and as though quivering,
vibrating, or playing up and down;] syn. زَهَاهُ
[of which, when it relates to the mirage, the
meaning is best expressed by the latter of the two
explanations here given]. (TA.) ―
-b6-  وَرَفَعْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ
فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَاتٍ, in the Kur [xliii. 31], means
(assumed tropical:)  And we have exalted some of them above others
in degrees of rank, or station: and نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَاتٍ
مَنْ نَشَآءُ, in the same, [vi. 83, and xii. 76,] (assumed tropical:)  We
exalt in degrees of rank, or station, whom We
please: (Er-Rághib:) and وَاللّٰهُ يَرْفَعُ مَنْ يَشَآءُ
وَيَخْفِضُ (assumed tropical:)  And God exalteth whom He pleaseth,
and abaseth: (S and TA:) and [in like manner,]
رَفْعُ الذِّكْرِ means the exalting of one's fame;
as in the Kur xciv. 4. (Er-Rághib.) But the
words, وَإِلَى السَّمَآءِ كَيْفَ رُفِعَتْ, in the Kur
[lxxxviii. 18], indicate two meanings; And to the
heaven, how it is elevated in respect of its place;
and (assumed tropical:)  how it is exalted in respect of excellence,
and exaltation of rank. (Er-Rághib.) [In like
manner also,] فِى بُيُوتٍ أَذِنَ اللّٰهُ أَنْ تُرْفَعَ, in the
Kur [xxiv. 36], means In houses which God hath
permitted to be built; (Bd, TA;) accord. to
some: (TA:) or, (assumed tropical:)  to be honoured; (Zj, Bd;) so
says El-Hasan; (Zj;) or, (assumed tropical:)  to be exalted in estimation. (Er-Rághib.) It is said in a trad., إِنَّ
اللّٰهَ يَرْفَعُ العَدْلَ وَيَخْفِضُهُ (assumed tropical:)  Verily God exalteth
the just, and maketh him to have the ascendency
over the unjust, and at one time abaseth him, so

thing]: (M voce رَبَأَ:) and إِنِّى لَأَرْفَعْكَ عَنْ هٰذَا
الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily I exalt thee, or hold thee, above
this thing]. (S voce رَبَأَ, q. v.) ―
-b7-  رَفَعَ اللّٰهُ عَمَلَهُ
(assumed tropical:)  [God honoured his work by acceptance; or] God
accepted his work. (Msb.) It is said in the Kur
[xxxv. 11], وَالْعَمَلُ الصَّالِحُ يَرْفَعُهُ (assumed tropical:)  And righteous
work He will accept: (Jel:) or the meaning is
يَرْفَعُ العَمَلُ الصَّالِحُ الكَلِمَ الطَّيَّبَ (assumed tropical:)  [righteous work
will cause praise, or the like, (mentioned immediately before the above-cited words of the Kur,)
to ascend, and obtain acceptance]: (Mujáhid,
TA:) Katádeh says, [that the meaning is,] speech
will not be accepted without work. (TA.) ―
-b8-
رَفْعٌ Also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The bringing a thing near;
or presenting, or offering, it; syn. تَقْرِيبٌ. (S.)
And hence, رَفَعْتُهُ إِلَى السُّلْطَانِ, (S, Mgh, K,) and
إِلَى الحَكَمِ, (TA,) inf. n. رَفْعٌ (S, * TA) and رُفْعَانٌ

or (tropical:)  he presented him to, or brought him before,
or brought him forward to, the governor, or
judge, to arraign him and contest with him, and

denotes the doing so mutually; for, accord. to
Mtr,] خَصْمَهُ إِلَى السُّلْطَانِ ↓ رَافَعَ signifies (tropical:)  he
brought his adversary before the Sultán (قَرَّبَهُ
إِلَيْهِ), the latter doing the same with him. (Mgh.)

signifies (tropical:)  I traced up the man's lineage to his
greatest ancestor; or I mentioned his lineage, saying, He is such a one the son of such a one, or
He is of such a tribe, or city, &c.; syn. نَمَيْتُهُ,

-b11-  And hence, رَفَعَ الحَدِيثَ
إِلَى النَّبِىِّ (tropical:)  [He traced up, or ascribed, or attributed, the tradition to the Prophet, mentioning,
in ascending order, the persons by whom it had
been handed down, up to the Prophet; in the

الحَدِيثَ إِلَى قَائِلِهِ, meaning أَسْنَدَهُ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He

a one told me, from such a one,” (and so on if
more than one intervened between him and the
Prophet,) “ from the Apostle of God; ” or with
an interruption in the mention of the persons by
whom it had been transmitted]. (S * and Msb in
art. سند.) [And hence what next follows.] It is
said in a trad., رَفَعَتْ إِلَيْنَا مِنَ البَلَاغِ ↓ كُلُّ رَافِعَةٍ
فَقَدْ حَرَّمْتُهَا أَنْ تُعْضَدَ أَوْتُخْبَطَ, (S, * TA, [in a very
old and excellent copy of the former of which I
find, as above, إِلَيْنَا, and so in some copies of the
K and in the O and TA in art. بلغ; but in one
copy of the S and in the TA in the present art.,
I find in its place عَلَيْنَا, and so in the CK in art.
بلغ, where the verb preceding it is erroneously
written رُفِعَتْ; and in the L, in the place of الينا
is put عَنَّا; of all which three readings I prefer
the first; though the last is agreeable with an
explanation of رَفَعْتُهُ given in the Msb and in the
sentence next following;]) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Every company
of men (جَمَاعَة, S, TA), or person (نَفْس, TA),
that communicates, or announces, from us, (S,

communicated, or announced,] or [aught] of what
is communicated, or announced, of the Kur-án
and of the [statutes, or ordinances, &c., termed]
سُنَن, (K in art. بلغ,) or the meaning is مِنْ ذَوِى
البَلَاغِ, i. e., التَّبْلِيغِ, [of those who have the office
of communicating, or announcing,] the simple
subst. being put in the place of the inf. n., (T, O,

person, communicate, or announce, and relate,

but some relate it differently, saying, مِنَ البُلَّاغِ
[of the communicaters, or announcers,] like حُدَّاث
in the sense of مُحَدِّثُون: (TA:) and some say,
مِنَ البِلَاغِ, meaning من المُبَالِغِينَ فِى التَّبْلِيغِ, i. e.
of those who do their utmost in communicating,
or announcing. (Hr, and K in art. بلغ.) ―

himself, or herself, to the full, or to the utmost,

TA;) or to go quickly; (Msb;) or to go with
the utmost celerity: (TA in art. نص:) or constrained him, or her, to go the pace termed مَرْفُوع
[q. v. infrà], (TA,) which is an inf. n. of the
intrans. verb رَفَعَ [q. v. infrà] said of a camel
(S, TA) and of a beast: (TA:) and ↓ رفّعهُ, (S,
TA,) [and رفّعها,] and رفّع مِنْهُ, (TA,) [and مِنْهَا,]

the tablet to record aught] against the child.
(Msb.) ―
-b21-  [رَفَعَ often signifies (assumed tropical:)  He withdrew,

Mohammad Ibn-Es-Sereé, [so in two copies of
the S, but in others, accord. to the TA, Ibn-EsSarráj,] they did not say رَفُعَ from رَفِيعٌ in the
