ردأ1
رَدَأَ الحَائِطَ, [aor.
رَدَاَ, inf. n. رَدْءٌ,] He supported, propped, or stayed, the wall, (ISh, T, K,)
by means of a piece of timber or wood, or a
buttress or the like, to prevent its falling; (ISh,
T;) as also ↓ ارادأهُ: (Yoo, T, K:) or رَدَأَ الحَائِطَ
بِبِنَآءٍ [he supported the wall by a structure;] he
attached a structure to the wall. (M.) ―
-b2-  Hence,
(T,) رَدَأَهُ بِهِ He strengthened and supported him,
or it, by means of it, (Lth, T, M, * K,) namely, a
person by a thing, (Lth, T,) or a thing by a thing,
(M,) like as one strengthens and supports a wall
by means of a structure which he attaches thereto;
(T;) as also ↓ ارادأهُ. (T, * K.) And رَدَأَهُ, (Mgh,
TA,) inf. n. رَدْءٌ, (Mgh,) He helped, aided, or
assisted, him; (Mgh, TA;) as also ↓ اردأهُ: (T, S,
M, Msb, K:) and رَدَأْتُهُ and ↓ أَرْدَأْتُهُ, (T,) or
بِنَفْسِى ↓ أَرْدَأْتُهُ, (S,) I was, or became, a helper,
an aider, or an assistant, to him. (T, S.) ―
-b3-
Hence also, (i. e., from ردأ الحَائط,) رَدَأَ الإِبِلَ
(tropical:)  He took good care of the camels, (A, K, TA,)
in tending and pasturing them. (A, TA.) ―
-b4-  And
رَدَأَهُ بِحَجَرٍ He cast a stone at him; (M, K;)
like [رَدَاهُ, mentioned in art. ردى, and] دَرَأَهُ. (M.)
-A2-  رَدُؤَ, aor.
رَدُاَ, inf. n. رَدَآءَةٌ, (T, S, M, K, &c.,)
for which one should not say رَدَاوَةٌ; (T;) and Th
mentions also رَدَأَ and رَدِىءَ as syn. with رَدُؤَ, but
these are strange; and more strange is what is said
in the Msb, namely, رَدَا aor. يَرْدُو, part. n. رَدِىٌّ,
[as a dial. var.,] asserted by IDrst, in the Expos.
of the Fs, to be erroneous, and peculiar to the
vulgar; (MF, TA;) It (a thing, T, S, M, Msb,)
[and he, see رَدِىْءٌ, its part. n.,] was, or became,
bad, corrupt, vitious, depraved, or the like; (S,
M, Msb, * K;) or of no rank, or estimation; low,
ignoble, vile, or mean; (Msb;) [disapproved, disliked, hated, or abominable: (see رَدِىْءٌ:)] and he
was, or became, weak, and impotent, so as to be
in want or need. (TA from the Expositions of
the Fs.)

-b4-  And He let it down;
namely, a veil, or curtain. (K.)
-A2-  Also He

like; (S, K;) namely, a thing; said of a man;
(S;) [and ↓ ردّآهُ is used in the same sense: (see
1 in art. جشب:)] he made, or asserted, or held,
it (a thing) to be رَدِىء [or bad, &c.]. (TA.) ―
-b2-
And اردأ signifies He did a thing, or a deed, that
was رَدِىْء [or bad, &c.]: or he met with, or experienced, (أَصَابَ,) a thing that was رَدِىْء. (M,
K.)
-A3-  اردأ عَلَى غَيْرِهِ It exceeded another thing;
as also أَرْدَى: (M:) [or the latter only:] accord.
to IAar, one says اردأ عَلَى السِّتِّينَ, with ء, (M,)
and, accord. to Lth, على الخَمْسِينَ, (TA,) and,
[accord. to F,] على مِائَةٍ, (K,) meaning He exceeded [the age of sixty, and fifty, and a hundred]:
(M, K, TA:) but Az says that اردأ, with ء, [in
these phrases,] though authorized by Lth, is
wrong; (TA;) and accord. to A' Obeyed, one
says أَرْدَيْتُ. (M. [It is added, however, in the
M, that اردأ may perhaps be also used in poetry
in the same sense without the prep. على.])
5

another. (Lth, M, TA.)

means of which one is helped, aided, or assisted;
such as the دِفْء [or thing by which one is
rendered warm, or protected from the cold wind].
(Bd in xxviii. 34; where it has the meaning next
following, as is said in the T and S.) ―
-b3-  A helper,
an aider, or an assistant. (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb,
K.) You say, فُلَانٌ رِدْءٌ لِفُلَانٍ Such a one is an

-b4-
And i. q. مَادَّةٌ [app. as meaning An accession; or

(Msb;) disapproved, disliked, hated, or abominable: and weak, and impotent, so as to be in
want or need: and accord to the Msb, one says
also رَدِىٌّ; [there said to be a dial. var.;] but this
is asserted by IDrst, in the Expos. of the Fs, to
be erroneous, and peculiar to the vulgar: (TA:)
pl. أَرْدِئَآءُ, with two hemzehs, (M, K,) applied to
a people, or company of men. (M.)
