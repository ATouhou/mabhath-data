ردى1
رَدِىَ aor. يَرْدَى, inf. n. رَدًى, He (a man,
TA) perished. (S, M, Msb, K.) [See an ex. in
the Kur xx. 17.] ―
-b2-  And رَدِىَ (AZ, T, M, and
so in a copy of the S,) aor. يَرْدَى, (AZ, T,) inf. n.
رَدًى; (M;) or رَدَى; (K, and so in copies of
the S;) or both of these verbs; aor. of the
latter يَرْدِى; (TA;) and ↓ تردّى; (S, M, K;) He
fell into a well: (AZ, * T, * S, K:) or he tumbled
down into a deep hollow, or cavity, or pit:
(M:) or ↓ the last of these verbs has this meaning: (Lth, T:) or it signifies he fell into a deep
hollow, or cavity, or pit: (Msb:) or he tumbled
down (S) from a mountain; (AZ, T, S;) and so
the first, or second: (S:) and ↓ تردّى signifies
he fell from a mountain and died. (TA.) إِذَا
↓ تَرَدَّى, in the Kur [xcii. 11], means When he
falls into the abyss of the fire [of Hell]: (T, *
TA:) or into the cavity of the grave: or into the
lowest depth of Hell: or when he perishes: (Bd:)
or when he dies. (T.) ―
-b3-  And رَدَى He (a man)
went away. (K.) You say, مَا أَدْرِى أَيْنَ رَدَى I
know not whither he went away, or has gone away.
(S.)
-A2-  رَدَاهُ, (S, M, K,) aor. يَرْدِى, (M,) inf. n.
رَدْىٌ, (TK,) He broke it; (M, K;) namely, a thing
with a stone: (M:) or he beat it, [or battered it,]
namely, a stone with a piece of rock, or with a pickaxe, in order to break it. (S.) ―
-b2-  And He dashed
himself against him, or knocked against him,
(S, K, TA,) like as the pickaxe knocks against
the stone. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And رَدَاهُ بِحَجَرٍ, (T, K,) or
بِحِجَارَةٍ, (S,) aor. يَرْدِى, inf. n. رَدْىٌ; (T;) and
رَدَاهُ بِحَجَرٍ, (K and TA in art. ردو,) aor. يَرْدُو,
inf. n. رَدْوٌ, (TA,) with و for the final radical;
(K, TA;) [like رَدَأَهُ, and دَرَأَهُ;] He threw at him,
or threw at him and hit him, with a stone, or
stones. (T, S, M.) [It is also said in the T, with
reference to مِرْدَاةٌ, as signifying a large stone
with which other stones are beaten, or battered,
الرَّدْىُ إِنَّمَا هُوَ رَفْعٌ بِهَا وَرَمْىٌ بِهَا; but I think that
رَفْعٌ is a mistranscription for دَفْعٌ; and that the
meaning intended to be expressed by these words
is, that رَدْىٌ signifies The thrusting with a مِرْدَاة;
and the throwing it, or with it.] ―
-b4-  [Hence, app.,]
رَدَى said of a horse, (As, ISk, T, S, M, K,) aor.
يَرْدِى, (As, ISk, T, S, K,) inf. n. رَدْىٌ and رَدَيَانٌ;
(ISk, S, M, K;) and رَدَا, (K and TA in art. ردو,
[in the CK, و is omitted before the word لُغَةٌ in
that art.,]) aor. يَرْدُو; (TA;) [and, accord. to
Freytag, ↓ ارتدى is used in the same sense by
Jereer;] He beat, or battered, the ground, (رَجَمَ
الأَرْضَ, As, ISk, T, S, ISk, T, S, M, K,) with his hoofs,
(M, K, TA,) in running, (As, T,) or in going
along, and in running, (M,) or in going a pace
between running and vehement walking: (ISk,
S:) or رَدَيَانٌ signifies the same as تَقْرِيبٌ: (AZ,
T, M: [see 2 in art. قرب:]) or it is [a manner of
going] between running and walking: (K:) or
the running (T, S, M) of the horse (T) or of the
ass (S, M) between his آرِىّ [or place of confinement, or the loop to which he is tied,] and
his مُتَمَعَّك [or place of rolling upon the ground];
(T, S, M;) thus explained by El-Munteji' Ibn-Nebhán, (T, S,) to As. (S.) In the K, رَجَمَتْ
is erroneously put for رَجَمَ; being app. taken
from the M, in which it refers to horses; [not to
a single horse;] as does also the pronoun in
بِحَوَافِرِهَا, in the same portion of the passage in
the K and in the M. (TA.) Accord. to AZ,
this is from رَدَيَانُ الجَوَارِى, explained in what
follows. (Ham p. 221.) ―
-b5-  You say, رَدَتِ الجَارِيَةُ
The girl raised one leg and went along upon the
other, in play; (K, TA;) and so ↓ اِرْتَدَت: (TA:)
and الجَوَارِى يُرْدِينَ, inf. n. رَدَيَانٌ; (M;) or
↓ يَرْتَدِينَ; (T;) the girls played, (T, M,) raising
one leg, (M,) or one of them raising one leg, (T,)
and going along upon the other: (T, M:) or
رَدَيَانُ الجَوَارِى signifies the girls' playing in which
one of them raises one leg and steps with the
other two steps, and then puts it down and raises
the other, doing thus several times. (AZ, Ham
p. 221.) And رَدَى الغُلَامُ The boy raised one leg
and leaped, or jumped, [or hopped,] with the
other. (S.) And رَدَى الغُرَابُ, (M, K,) aor.
يَرْدِى, (T,) The crow, or raven, raised one leg
and hopped on the other; or leaped along. (T,
M, K.)
-A3-  رَدَتْ غَنَمِى My sheep, or goats, increased, or exceeded; as also ↓ أَرْدَتْ. (Fr, M,
K.) ―
-b2-  And رَدَيْتُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ and ↓ ارديت I
exceeded the thing. (M.) And عَلَى غَيْرِهِ ↓ اردى
It exceeded another thing; as also اردأ [q. v.]
(M in art. ردأ.) And رَدَيْتُ عَلَى الخَمْسِينَ, (S,
M, *) and الثَّمَانِينَ, (M,) and ↓ ارديت, (S,) I
exceeded [the age of fifty, and eighty]. (S, M. *)
2
ردّاهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. تَرْدِيَةٌ, (Msb,) He
made him to fall, or threw him down, (Msb, K,)
into a deep hollow, or cavity, or pit, (Msb,) or
into a well; as also ↓ ارداهُ. (K.) He (God)
overthrew him; as also ↓ ارداهُ. (M.)
-A2-  رَدَّيْتُهُ,
inf. n. as above, I clad him with a رِدَآء [q.
v.]. (S.)
3
رَادَيْتُ عَن القَوْم, (S, K. *) inf. n. مُرَادَاةٌ, (S,)
I contended in throwing stones in defence of the
people, or party. (S, K. *)
-A2-  راداهُ, (T, S, M, K,)
inf. n. as above, (TA,) is also syn. with رَاوَدَهُ [He
endeavoured to turn him; or to turn him by
blandishment, or by deceitful arts; or to entice
him to turn]; (S, M, K;) formed from the latter
by transposition; (S;) or دَاوَرَهُ [which means the
same]; عَلَى الأَمْرِ [to the thing, or  affair]: (T as
on the authority of A 'Obeyd:) and دَارَاهُ [which
means the same; or he treated him with gentleness, or blandishment; soothed, coaxed, wheedled,
or cajoled, him; or he deceived, deluded, beguiled,
circumvented, or outwitted, him; or endeavoured,
or desired, to do so]; (S, M, K; the first as on
the authority of A 'Obeyd;) or, accord. to AA,
i. q. دَاجَاهُ and دَالَاهُ and فَانَاهُ [all of which are
syn. with دَارَاهُ]. (T.)
4
ارداهُ He (i. e. God, M, or another, S, M *)
caused him to perish; or destroyed him. (S, M,
K.) Hence, (M,) in the Kur [xxxvii. 54],
إِنْ كِدْتَ لَتُرْدِينِ Verily thou almost causedst me
to perish, or destroyedst me. (T, M. *) ―
-b2-  See
also 2, in two places. ―
-b3-  Also He made him (i. e.
a horse) to go in the manner signified by the verb
رَدَى [q. v., meaning, beating, or battering, the
ground, &c.]: so accord. to the M and K, except
that, in both, the fem. pronoun is used, in the M
referring to horses, and in the K improperly
referring to a single horse. (TA.) ―
-b4-  See also 1,
last four sentences.
5
تردّى: see 1, second and third sentences, in
four places. ―
-b2-  He was, or became, overthrown.
(M.)
-A2-  Also, and ↓ ارتدى, He put on, or clad
himself with, or wore, a رِدَآء [q. v.]: (S, K: but
in the latter the verbs are fem. [as said of a woman]:) or so تردّى بِرِدَآءٍ and بِهِ ↓ ارتدى. (M,
Msb.) ―
-b2-  And تردّى بِسَيْفِهِ, and ↓ ارتدى, (assumed tropical:)  He
hung upon himself his sword, putting its suspensory belt or cord upon his neck or shoulder;
syn. تَقَلَّدَهُ. (M.) ―
-b3-  And تردّت الجَارِيَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The
girl, or young woman, put on, or decked herself
with, a وِشَاح [q. v.], which is also called رِدَآء.
(T, K.)
8
ارتدى: see 1, in the latter half of the paragraph, in three places.
-A2-  See also 5, in three
places: and see an ex. voce رِدَآءٌ ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
اِرْتَدَانِى He carried me, or bore me, upon his
shoulder, in the place of the رِدَآء. (Ham p. 471.)
رَدًى an inf. n. of رَدِىَ [q. v.]. (S, M, Msb, K.)
-A2-  Also Excess, redundance, or superfluity; syn.
زِيَادَةٌ: so in the saying, مَا بَلَغْتُ رَدَى عَطِيَّتِكَ,
i. e. I have not attained to thy excess, &c., in thy
gift: and يُعْجِبُنِى رَدَى قَوْلِكَ The excess of thy
saying pleases me: and so in the saying of
Kutheiyir,
لَهُ عَهْدُ وُدٍّ لَمْ يَكَدَّرْ يَزِينُهُ
رَدَى قَوْلِ مَعْرُوفٍ حَدِيثٍ وَمُزْمِنِ
meaning [He has a covenant of love, or affection,
into which he has entered, which has not been
sullied, and] which excess of kind speech, on his
part, [recent and of long duration,] adorns: (T:)
or, [as ISd cites the verse,] قَوْلِ مَعْرُوفٍ ↓ رَدِى
&c.: [and he adds,] it is said, in explanation
thereof, that رَدِى means زِيَادَة; and I think that
it is an inf. n., of the measure فَعِلٌ, like ضَحِكٌ and
حَبِقٌ, or a subst. put in the place of an inf. n.
(M.)
-A3-  See also رَدَاةٌ.
رَدٍ [originally رَدِىٌ] Perishing; (IAar, T, S,
M, K;) applied to a man: fem. رَدِيَةٌ. (S, K.)
-A2-  See also the next preceding paragraph.
رِدْيَةٌ A mode, or manner, of wearing the رِدَآء:
(S, M, * Msb: *) like رِكْبَةٌ from الرُّكُوبُ, and
جِلْسَةٌ from الجُلُوسُ: (S:) you say, هُوَ حَسَنُ
الرِّدْيَةِ [He is comely in respect of the manner of
wearing the ردآء] (S, M, Msb.)
رَدَاةٌ A rock; or piece of rock; or great mass of
stone, or of hard stone: (Fr, T, S, K:) pl. رَدَيَاتٌ
(Fr, T) and [coll. gen. n.] ↓ رَدًى. (S, K.)
رِدَآءٌ A certain garment; (S, Msb;) a kind of
مِلْحَفَة [or outer wrapping garment], (M, K,)
well known; (K;) one of the garments that are
not cut and sewed; (Mgh in art. قطع, and MF
voce إِزَارٌ;) [being of a single piece;] covering the
upper half of the body; or lying upon the shoulders and back; (MF voce إِزَارٌ;) or falling upon
the belly and there ending: (TA voce صِفْرٌ:) [a
رداء worn by Mohammad, “thrown over the left
shoulder and wrapped round the body under the
right arm,” is described as “four cubits long and
two cubits and a span wide:” (Sprenger's Life of
Mohammad, Part I, English ed., pp. 86 and 87:)]
it is of the masc. gender, and it is not allowable
to make it fem.: (IAmb, Msb:) the dual is
رِدَاآنِ and رِدَاوَانِ the latter being allowable,
(S, Msb,) but the former being preferable: (S:)
and the pl. is أَرْدِيَةٌ: (S, M, Msb:) the رِدَآء is also
called ↓ رِدَآءَةٌ, (M, K, TA, [in the CK رِداة,]) like
as the إِزَار is also called إِزَارَةق; (M;) and ↓ مِرْدَاةٌ,
(K, TA, in the CK مَرْداة,) of which the pl. is
↓ مَرَادٍ, (TA,) occurring in the saying,
مَرَادِىَ الحَرِيرِ ↓ لَا يَرْتَدِى
وَلَا يُرَى بِسُدَّةِ الأَمِيرِ
إِلَّا لِحَلْبِ الشَّاْةِ وَالبَعِيرِ
[He will not wear outer wrapping garments of
silk, nor will he be seen at the porch of the commander, or prince, unless for the purpose of
milking the sheep, or goat, and the camel]; (M,
TA;) المَرَادِى meaning الأَرْدِيَة; (M;) but accord.
to Th, it has no sing.: (M, TA:) [or] ↓ مَرَادٍ
signifies waist-wrappers; syn. أُزُرٌ. (K.) ―
-b2-  Hence,
صِفْرُ رِدَائِهَا, in a description of Umm-Zara, in a
trad., meaning (assumed tropical:)  Lank in her belly; as though
her ردآء were empty. (TA in art. صفر.) ―
-b3-  And
غَمْرُ الرِّدَآءِ (tropical:)  Abounding in beneficence. (T, M, K,
TA.) And عَيْشٌ غَمْرُ الرِّدَآءِ (tropical:)  A life ample, or
plentiful, in its means. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And رِدَآءُ الشَّبَابِ
(assumed tropical:)  The beauty, and softness, tenderness, or delicateness, of youth. (T.) ―
-b5-  And رِدَآءُ الشَّمْسِ (assumed tropical:)  The
light, (M,) or beauty and light, (T,) of the sun.
(T, M.) ―
-b6-  رِدَآءٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A sword; (T, M,
K;) [ISd says,] I think, as being likened to the
garment thus called; (M;) [i. e.] because it is
hung, by its suspensory cords, upon the neck and
shoulder [like that garment]. (T.) [See also
مِرْدًى, near the end of the paragraph.] Mutemmem says,
لَقَدْ كَفَّنَ المِنْهَالُ تَحْتَ رِدَائِهِ
فَتًى غَيْرَ مِبْطَانِ العَشِيَّاتِ أَرْوَعَا
[Verily El-Minhál has shrouded beneath his
sword a young man not voracious in the evenings,
when the chief meal is eaten, one who excited the
admiration of the beholder]: for El-Minhál had
slain his [the poet's] brother Málik; and when a
man slew another who was a celebrated man, he
used to lay his sword upon him, in order that his
slayer might be known. (M. [But see, in relation to this verse, a long story in the Ham
pp. 370-372.]) And El-Khansà says,
جَعَلْتَ رِدَآءَكَ فِيهَا خِمَارَا  وَدَاهِيَةٍ جَرَّهَا جَارِمٌ
[And in many a calamity which a committer of
a crime has brought to pass, thou hast made thy
sword to be as a covering to the head]; meaning,
thou hast smitten, therein, the necks of thine
enemies with thy sword like the خمار [which
means a woman's “muffler” and a man's “turban”]. (T.) ―
-b7-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A bow; (AAF, M, IAth;)
because it is borne upon the shoulder, which is
the place of the رداء [properly thus called].
(IAth, TA.) ―
-b8-  And [for the like reason] (assumed tropical:)  The
[ornament called] وِشَاح [q. v., worn by women].
(T, K.) So in a verse of El-Aashà, cited voce
رَقْرَقَ. (T.) ―
-b9-  And (assumed tropical:)  A bier; because it is borne
upon the place of the رداء [properly thus called,
i. e., upon the shoulder]. (Ham p. 471.) ―
-b10-
And (assumed tropical:)  Debt; (T, M, K;) because it is [regarded
as] a thing that cleaves to the neck of the debtor,
like as the رداء [properly thus called] cleaves
to the shoulders of the wearer. (T.) You say,
هُوَ خَفِيفُ الرِّدَآءِ, meaning (tropical:)  He is little burdened
in respect of debt: and also, in respect of household. (K, * TA.) [See also an ex. voce نَسَآءٌ.] ―
-b11-
Also (assumed tropical:)  Intelligence: ―
-b12-  and (assumed tropical:)  ignorance: (M,
K:) both on the authority of IAar: (M:) ―
-b13-  he
says also that it means (assumed tropical:)  anything that is the
pride, or ornament, of a person; (T, M;) even,
(M,) for instance, one's house, and one's father;
(T, M;) or one's house and one's beast; (so in
the TA;) each of these, he says, is one's رداء [or
(assumed tropical:)  pride]: (T:) thus, (M,) it is (assumed tropical:)  a thing that
graces: and (assumed tropical:)  a thing that disgraces: (M, K:)
so that it has two contr. meanings: thus in the
K, referring to the meanings of “intelligence”
and “ignorance:” but this requires consideration.
(TA.)
رِدَآءَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, first
signification.
رَدِىٌّ: see رَدِىْءٌ, in art. ردأ
الرَّادِى The lion; (K;) because he dashes himself (يَرْدِى i. e. يَصْدِمُ) [against his prey]. (TA.)
مِرْدًى A stone that is thrown; (S, K;) as also
↓ مِرْدَاةٌ: (T, S:) or a piece of rock with which
date-stones are broken: (Ham p. 417:) and accord. to ISk, ↓ the latter signifies a piece of rock
with which stones are broken, (S,) or with which
one breaks [anything]: (M:) or a stone which the
strong man can hardly, or not at all, lift with
his hands; [like مِرْدَأَةٌ; (TA in art. ردأ;)] with
which stones are broken; and with which they
beat and soften a rugged place that they hollow
out; and with which the hole of the [lizard
called] ضَبّ is broken, or battered, when it is
among large stones (فى قلعة [i. e. فِى قَلَعَةٍ]),
which قلعة it softens and demolishes: (En-Nadr,
T:) the same word (مرداة) also signifies the stone,
(T,) or the piece of rock, (M,) by means of which
the ضَبّ is guided to its hole: (T, M:) [and
accord. to Golius, on the authority of Meyd and
the Mirkát el-Loghah, the upper mill-stone:]
the pl. of مِرْدَاةٌ is ↓ مَرَادٍ: (T:) and this pl. is
[also] syn. with مَرَامٍ [app. as pl. of مِرْمَاةٌ, and
meaning the arrows thus called; or any missiles].
(M.) Hence the prov., ↓ عِنْدَ جُحْرِ كُلِّ ضَبٍّ مِرْدَاتُهُ
[Near by the hole of every dabb is its stone that
is to be thrown at it, or its stone by means of
which it guides itself to that hole]; applied to a
thing that is near at hand, having no obstacle in
the way to it; for the dabb will not be guided to
its hole, when it goes forth from it and returns
to it, except by means of a stone which it places
as a mark to point out its hole: (T:) or كُلُّ
↓ ضَبٍّ عِنْدَهُ مِرْدَاتُهُ (S, M, Meyd) i. e. Every
dabb has near by it its stone that is to be thrown
at it; (S, * Meyd;) for the dabb has little knowledge, therefore it prepares not its hole save by a
stone that may be a mark thereof, so that he who
seeks it finds the stone that is to be thrown at the
dabb near to it; therefore the prov. means that
thou shouldst not feel secure from accidents,
because calamities are prepared with every time,
or period; and it is applied to him who exposes
himself to destruction. (Meyd.) Hence also,
i. e. from مِرْدًى in the first of the senses assigned
to it above, (S,) or in the second of those senses,
(Ham p. 417,) said of a courageous man, إِنَّهُ
لَمِرْدَى حُرُوبٍ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily he is like the missile of
wars]; (S;) or فُلَانٌ مِرْدَى الحُرُوبِ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a
one is like the crushing stone of the wars]; or
مِرْدَى الخُصُومِ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  he whom they throw against
the antagonists and who crushes them: (Ham ubi
suprà:) and هُمْ مَرَادِى الحُرُوبِ: [مَرَادٍ being pl.
of مِرْدًى, as well as of مِرْدَاةٌ:] (S:) and فُلَانٌ
مِرْدَى خُصُومَةٍ وَحَرْبٍ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is very patient
in the endurance of contention and war. (M.)
مِرْدًى is also used as meaning (assumed tropical:)  A horse hard like
the stone thus called; thus in a verse of 'Antarah:
or it there means a horse that runs swiftly; from
الرَّدَيَانُ [an inf. n. of رَدَى, q. v.]: or it is from
الرَّدَى [inf. n. of رَدِىَ, and syn. therewith], meaning perdition: or it means, in that verse, [like
رِدَآءٌ,] a sword, [as being an instrument of perdition,] from الرَّدَى. (Ham p. 207.) ↓ مِرْدَاةٌ,
also, (S,) or نَاقَةٌ مِرْدَاةٌ, (TA,) is used as meaning
(assumed tropical:)  A she-camel like the stone thus called in hardness. (S, TA.) And ↓ مَرَادٍ [as pl. of مِرْدًى or of
مِرْدَاةٌ] means also (assumed tropical:)  The legs of camels, (Lth, T,
M, K,) and of the elephant (Lth, T, K) or of
elephants; as being likened to the stones thus
called; (M, TA;) or because of their heaviness,
and vehemence of tread. (T, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also مِرْدًى,
(so in the S,) or ↓ مُرْدِىٌّ, with damm [to the ل]
and with shedd [to the ى], (K,) A pole with
which a ship, or boat, is propelled, (S, K,) being
in the hand of the sailor: (S:) pl. [of the former]
مَرَادٍ, (S,) or [of the latter] مَرَادِىُّ: (K:) in the
dial. of the vulgar مِدْرى [pronounced by them
مِدْرَى, without tenween, or مِدْرَا, for مِدْرَأٌ]; pl.,
with the art., المَدَارِى [and vulgarly pronounced
مَدَارِى also without the art.]. (TA.)
مِرْدَاةٌ, and its pl. مَرَادٍ (which is also pl. of
مِرْدًى): see the next preceding paragraph, in
seven places: ―
-b2-  and see also رِدَآءٌ, in three places.
مُرْدِىٌّ: see مِرْدًى, last sentence.
اِمْرَأَةٌ هَيْفَآءُ المُرَدَّى A woman lank, or slender,
in the place of the [ornament called] وِشَاح [q.
v.]. (T.)
المُتَرَدِّيَةُ, in the Kur v. 4, means That which
falls from a mountain, or into a well, or from an
elevated place, and dies. (T.) The sheep or
goat thus termed is forbidden [to be eaten] because it has died without having been slaughtered according to the law. (Msb.)
