رطل1
رَطَلَ, (O, Msb, K,) aor.
رَطُلَ, inf. n. رَطْلٌ,
(Msb, TA,) He weighed a thing: (O, TA:) or
he put in motion a thing with his hand, (IDrd,
O,) or weighed with his hand a thing, (Msb,) or
tried a thing, (K,) in order that he might know
its weight (IDrd, O, Msb, K) nearly. (Msb.)
[See also 2.] But IF says, of this combination of
letters and the like, that they are not of the
genuine language [of the Arabs]. (O.)
-A2-  He
ran; syn. عَدَا. (O, K.)

تَرْطِيلٌ The act of weighing by, or with, أَرْطَال
[or pound-weights]. (K.) [See also 1.]
-A2-  Also
The anointing of the hair, (S, O,) or making it
soft, or smooth, (K,) with oil, or ointment, and
the crimping (تَكْسِير) thereof: (S, O, K:) and the
making it to be loose, and to hang down: (IAar,
IAmb, K:) accord. to IAmb, رطّل شَعَرَهُ means
he made his hair to be loose, and to hang down:
(O:) but accord. to the T, the saying of the
vulgar, رَطَّلْتُ شَعَرِى, as meaning رَجَّلْتُهُ, [i. e. I
made my hair to be wavy, or somewhat curly;
or combed it; or combed it down; &c.;] is a
mistake: for ترطيل signifies the act of making the
hair soft, or smooth, with oil, or ointment; and
wiping it so that it becomes soft, or smooth, and
glossy. (TA.)

راطل ذَهَبًا بِذَهَبٍ, inf. n. مُرَاطَلَةٌ, He sold by
counterpoising gold for gold, and وَرِقًا بِوَرِقٍ

says] I have not found this except in the “ Muwatta. ” (Mgh.) You say also, بَاعَ مُرَاطَلَةً [He
sold by counterpoising]. (TA.)

ارطل He had a child such as is termed رَطْل
[q. v.]: (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K:) or his ears became

رَطْلٌ (S, O, K) and ↓ رِطْلٌ (K) A man soft,
lax, or uncompact; (S, O, K, * TA;) as also
↓ مُرْطِلٌ: (K, TA:) and old and weak: or inclining to softness, and laxness, or uncompactness, and old age: (K:) and a boy slender, slim,
or lean, (K, TA,) or, as some say, (TA,) near to
attaining puberty, or virility: (K, TA:) or whose
bones have not become strong: (K:) or the former,
applied to a boy, whose strength has not become
fully established; as also ↓ مُرْطَلٌ [thus written
with fet-h to the ط]: (O:) pl. رِطَلَةٌ: (O, TA:)
and the first, i. e. رَطْلٌ, a man who is foolish;
stupid; unsound, or deficient, in intellect or
understanding; (K;) fem. with ة: (TA:) one

who is not profitable to any one: and also having
flaccid ears: (O:) and, applied to a horse, (Ibn-
'Abbád, O, K,) as also ↓ رِطْلٌ, (K,) or, as some
say, the latter only, (TA,) light, (Ibn-'Abbád, O,
K, TA,) and weak: (TA:) fem. with ة, (O, K,
TA,) in all the senses. (TA.)
-A2-  [الرَّطْلُ is also
explained in the K as syn. with العَدْلُ: but
perhaps this is a mistranscription for العَدْوُ, inf. n.
of عَدَا: see 1, last sentence.]
-A3-  See also the next
paragraph.
رِطْلٌ and ↓ رَطْلٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) the
former of which is the better known, (Msb, TA,)
or the more chaste, (O, TA,) [but the latter is
that which is now in common use,] A certain
thing with which one weighs, (Mgh, O, Msb,) or
which one uses as a measure of capacity: (Mgh,
Msb:) [or rather both: a pound-weight: and a
pint-measure: and also a pound of anything: and
a pint of anything:] the half of what is termed
مَنًا: (S:) accord. to the standard of Baghdád,
twelve ounces; the ounce (أُوقِيَّة) being an إِسْتَار
and two thirds of an استار; and the استار being
four مَثَاقِيل and half of a مِثْقَال; and the مثقال
being a دِرْهَم and three sevenths of a درهم; and
the درهم being six دَوَانِق; and the دَانِق being eight
حَبَّات and two fifths of a حَبَّة; so that the رطل
is ninety مثاقيل; i. e. a hundred and twenty-eight
دَرَاهِم and four sevenths of a درهم (Msb:) or,
accord. to A 'Obeyd, a hundred and twenty-eight
دراهم of the weight of seven (وَزْنَ سَبْعَةٍ [explained
voce دِرْهَمٌ]): (Mgh:) or twelve ounces; the ounce
(أُوقِيَّة, i. e. the ounce of the Arabs, TA,) being
forty دراهم; (Mgh, K, TA;) so that the whole is
four hundred and eighty دراهم: (Mgh, TA:)
this is the Syrian رطل: (TA:) and thus it is,
accord. to El-Harbee, in the saying, السُّنَّةُ فِى
النِّكَاحِ رِطْلٌ [meaning The usage of the Prophet
in the case of marriage was to give a رطل of
silver]: (Mgh, TA:) so says Az in the T:
(Mgh:) or, as is [also] said by Az, it is in this
instance twelve ounces and a نَشّ; the نشّ being
twenty [دراهم] so that the whole is five hundred
دراهم; as is related on the authority of 'Áïsheh:
but in a trad. 'Omar, twelve ounces, without
the mention of the نشّ: accord. to the lawyers,
[however,] when the رطل is mentioned without
restriction, what is meant thereby is the رطل of
Baghdád: (TA:) [as a measure of capacity,
i. e. a pint,] it is said in the A [&c.] to be the
eighth part of the صَاع; the half of the مُدّ;
(TA;) [i. e.] the half of the مَنّ: and hence
applied to one of the vessels of the vintner [app.
because it contains a pint]: (Har p. 650:) pl.
أَرْطَالٌ. (Msb.)
-A2-  See also رَطْلٌ, in two places.
مُرْطَلٌ: see رَطْلٌ: ―

by Sgh with fet-h, (TA,) i. e. ↓ مُرْطَلٌ, (so in the
O,) A tall man. (O, K.) ―
