رزق1
رَزَقَهُ اللّٰهُ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) aor.
رَزُقَ, (Msb,
TA,) inf. n. رِزْقٌ, (S,) or رَزْقٌ, (IB, K,) the latter
being the proper inf. n., (K,) and the former a
simple subst. but also used as an inf. n., (TA,)
God caused what is termed رِزْق [q. v.] to come to
him: (K:) or God gave him. (S, IB.) [The
verb is doubly trans.: when the second objective
complement is implied, the phrase generally means
God caused the means of subsistence to come to
him; i. e., gave him, granted him, or bestowed
upon him, the means of subsistence; or supplied,
provided, or blessed, him therewith: when the
second objective complement is expressed, this
word is generally one signifying the means of
subsistence or the like, property, or offspring.]
One says also, رَزَقَ الطَّائِرُ فَرْخَهُ, aor.
رَزُقَ, inf. n.
رَزْقٌ, [The bird fed its young one.] (TA.) And
رَزَقَ الأَمِيرُ الجُنْدَ The commander gave their subsistence-money, pay, or allowances, to the army:
and رَزَقَ الجُنْدَ رَزْقَةً He gave the army their subsistence-money, &c., once: and رُزِقُوا رَزْقَتَيْنِ They
were given their subsistence-money, &c., twice.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence رُزِقَ also signifies It (a place)
was rained upon.] Lebeed says,
رُزِقَتْ مَرَابِيعَ النُّجُومِ وَصَابَهَا
وَدْقُ الرَّوَاعِدِ جَوْدُهَا وَرِهَامُهَا
meaning مُطِرَتْ; (TA;) i. e. They were rained
upon with the rain of the أَنْوَآء [pl. of نَوْءٌ q. v.]
of the رَبِيع, and the rain of the thundering clouds
fell upon them, the copious thereof and the drizzling and lasting thereof. (EM pp. 140 and 141.)
―
-b3-  And رَزَقَ فُلَانًا He thanked such a one; was
thankful, or grateful, to him; or acknowledged his beneficence: of the dial. of Azd, (K,)
i. e. Azd-Shanooah. (TA.) One says, فَعَلْتُ
ذٰلِكَ لَمَّا رَزَقْتَنِى i. e. لَمَّا شَكَرْتَنِى [I did that since,
or because, thou thankedst me]. (TA.) And hence,
in the Kur [lvi. 81], وَتَجْعَلُونَ رِزْقَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تَكَذِّبُونَ
[And do ye make your thanking to be that ye
disacknowledge the benefit received, as being from
God?]; (K;) i. e., accord. to Ibn-'Arafeh, do ye,
instead of acknowledging what God has bestowed
upon you, and being thankful for it, attribute it
to another than Him? or, accord. to Az and
others, [as J also says in the S,] the meaning is,
تَجْعَلُونَ شَكْرَ رِزِقْكُمُ التَّكْذِيبَ [do ye make the
thanking for your sustenance to be disacknowledgment?]: (TA:) and some read شَكْرَكُمْ [for
رِزْقَكُمْ]. (Bd.)

ارتزقوا, (S, Msb, K,) said of soldiers, (S,) or
of people, (Msb,) They took, or received, their
أَرْزَاق [i. e., when said of soldiers, portions of subsistence-money, pay, or allowances, and when said
of others, means of subsistence, &c.]. (S, Msb,
K.) ―
-b2-  See also what next follows.
10
استرزقهُ He asked, or demanded, of him
what is termed رِزْق [i. e. means of subsistence, &c.;
when said of a soldier, subsistence-money, pay, or
allowance]; (MA, TA;) as also ↓ ارتزقهُ. (TA.)
رِزْقٌ A thing whereby one profits, or from
which one derives advantage; (S, K;) as also
↓ مُرْتَزَقٌ, (K, TA,) in the pass. form: (TA: [in
the CK, erroneously, مُرْتَزِق:]) and a gift; and
especially, of God: (S:) or [especially, and according to general usage,] the means of subsistence, or of the support and growth of the body,
which God sends to [mankind and other] animals;
[sustenance, victuals, food, or provisions; or a
supply thereof from God:] but with the Moatezileh it means a thing possessed and eaten by the
deserving; so that it does not apply to what is
unlawful: (TA:) pl. أَرْزَاقٌ: (S, Msb, K:) and
what are thus termed are of two kinds; apparent,
[or material,] which are for the bodies, such as
aliments; and unapparent, [or intellectual,] which
are for the hearts and minds, such as the several
sorts of knowledge and of science: (TA:) or رِزْقٌ
properly signifies a portion, share, or lot; or
particularly, of something good, or excellent; syn.
حَظٌّ: and is conventionally made to apply to a
thing by which an animal is enabled to profit:
(Bd in ii. 2:) and [hence] it signifies also a daily
allowance of food or the like; and so ↓ رِزْقَةٌ of
which the pl. is رِزَقٌ: (TA:) [the subsistencemoney, pay, or allowance, of a soldier; or] what
is given forth to the soldier at the commencement
of every month, or day by day: or, accord. to ElKarkhee, العَطَآءُ is what is assigned to those who
fight; and الرَّزْقُ, to the poor: (Mgh: [but see
عَطَآءٌ:]) and ↓ رَزَقَاتٌ, pl. of ↓ رَزَقَةٌ, which is the
inf. n. of unity of رَرَقَ, signifies the portions of
subsistence-money, pay, or allowances, (syn. أَطْمَاع,)
of soldiers: (S, K:) one says, كَمْ رِزْقُكَ فِى الشَّهْرِ
How much is thy allowance of food, or the like,
[or thy subsistence-money, or pay,] in the month?
(TA:) and أَخَذُوا أَرْزَاقَهُمْ [They took, or received,
their portions of subsistence-money, &c.,] (S,
Msb, K) is said of soldiers. (S.) الرِّزْقُ الحَسَنُ
means A thing [or provision] that comes to one
without toil in the seeking thereof: or, as some
say, a thing [or provision] that is found without
one's looking, or watching, for it, and without
one's reckoning upon it, and without one's earning it, or labouring to earn it. (KT.) ―
-b2-  Also
(assumed tropical:)  Rain (S, K) is sometimes thus called; as in the
Kur xlv. 4 and li. 22: this being an amplification
in language; as when one says, “The dates are
in the bottom of the well; ” meaning thereby
“ the [water for] watering the palm-trees. ” (S.)

-b2-  رَوَازِقُ
