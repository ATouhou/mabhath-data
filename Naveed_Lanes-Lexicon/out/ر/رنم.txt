ترنّم; and ↓ رَنِمَ, (S, Msb,) aor.
رَنَمَ, (Msb,)
inf. n. [رَنَمٌ and] رَنِيمٌ; (TK;) i. q. رَجَّعَ صَوْتَهُ
(S, Msb) i. e. [He trilled, or quavered; or] he
reiterated his voice in his throat, or fauces, (S
and K and TA in art. رجع,) like [as is done in]
chanting, (S in that art.,) or in reading or reciting,
or singing, or piping, or other performances, of
such as are accompanied with quavering, or trilling: (TA in that art.:) both said of a singer:
(Msb:) and the former said of a bird, in its هَدِير
[or cooing]; (S, Msb;) and of a bow, when it is
twanged: (S:) and تَرْنِيمٌ [inf. n. of ↓ رنّم] signifies
the like: (S:) or التَّرْنِيمُ signifies تَطْرِيبُ الصَّوْتِ
[i. e. the trilling, or quavering, and prolonging
the voice; or prolonging the voice, and modulating
it sweetly, or warbling]; (T, * M, K;) and so
رَنِيمٌ [mentioned above as inf. n. of ↓ رَنِمَ]; (Lth,
T, M, K;) whence التَّرَنُّمُ [which signifies the
same, as is shown by what follows]: (Lth, T:)
↓ رنّم is said of the pigeon, (M, K,) and of the
[bird called] مُكَّاء, (M,) and of the [locust, or
species of locust, called] جُنْدَب [meaning it
chirped], and of the bow [meaning it emitted a
musical ringing sound, or a plaintive sound (see
تَرْنَمُوتٌ, below,) when twanged], (M, K,) and [in
like manner] of the lute, (M,) and of a thing
(M, K:) of any kind (M) of which the sound is
esteemed pleasant, or delightful; and تَرَنَّمَ likewise: (M, K:) or you say, الحَمَامَةُ تَتَرَنَّمُ [The
pigeon trills, or quavers, or cooes]: and of the
مُكَّآء you say, ↓ فِى صَوْتِهِ تَرْنِيمٌ [In its voice, or
cry, is a trilling, or quavering]: and of the bow,
and the lute, and a thing [of any kind] of which
the sound is esteemed pleasant, or delightful,
↓ لَهُ تَرْنِيمٌ [It has a musical ringing sound, or a
plaintive sound]. (Lth, T.) It is said in a trad.,
مَا أَذِنَ اللّٰهُ لِشَىْءٍ أَذَنَهُ لِنَبِىٍّ حَسَنِ التَّرَنُّمِ بِالقُرْآنِ
[God has not listened to anything as He listens
to a prophet having a good manner of trilling, or
quavering, or prolonging and modulating sweetly
his voice, in reciting the Kur-án]: or, as some
relate it, حَسَنِ الصَّوْتِ يَتَرَنَّمُ بِالقُرْآنِ [good in respect of the voice, trilling, &c., in reciting the
Kur-án]. (TA.)
رَنَمٌ i. q. صَوْتٌ [as meaning A voice, or sound;
or, more probably, the uttering thereof: see رَنِمَ,
of which it is an inf. n., in the next preceding
paragraph]. (S, K.)
رُنُمٌ [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned;
app. pl. of ↓ رَانِمَةٌ; like as رُمُمٌ is supposed to be
of رَامَّةٌ, originally رَامِمَةٌ;] Good, or excellent,
female singers. (IAar, T, K.)
رَنْمَةٌ, (M, and so in copies of the K.) thus it
seems to be accord. to [a rule observed in] the K,
but accord. to Z it seems to be ↓ رَنَمَةٌ, (TA, and
thus it is written in the CK,) and ↓ تَرْنَمُوتَةٌ, (M,
and so in the K accord. to the TA,) or ↓ تَرْنَمُوتٌ,
(S, [and so in my MS. copy of the K,]) or this
last also, (M,) or ↓ تَرْنُومَةٌ or تُرْنُومَةٌ, (accord. to
other copies of the K,) i. q. تَرَنُّمٌ [i. e. A trilling,
or quavering, &c.: see 5]. (S, M, K.) Thus in
the phrases, سَمِعَ رَنْمَةً حَسَنَةً and ↓ تَرْنَمُوتَةً [He
heard a good, or pleasing, trilling, &c.]: (M:)
and لَهُ رَنْمَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ or ↓ رَنَمَةٌ and ↓ تَرْنَمُوتَةٌ &c.
(accord. to different copies of the K) [i. e. He,
or it, has a good, or pleasing, trilling, &c.].
↓ تَرْنَمُوتٌ is formed by the addition of و and ت,
like as is مَلَكُوتٌ: (S:) it is said to be the only instance in which ت is added at the beginning and
end of a word: (MF:) and it is used in relation
to a bow [as meaning A musical ringing sound
on the occasion of twanging]. (S, M.) [↓ رَنِيمٌ,
also, said in the TK to be an inf. n. of رَنِمَ, and in
the M and K to be syn. with تَرْنِيمٌ, is used in a
similar manner:] you say, سَمِعْتُ لَهُ رَنِيمًا [I heard
him to have a trilling, or quavering, sound proceeding from him; or I heard it to have a musical
ringing sound proceeding from it]; taken from
the تَرَنُّم of the bird in its cooing. (Msb.)
رَنَمَةٌ A certain slender plant, (T, K,) well
known; (T;) said by As to be one of the plants
growing in plain, or soft, ground: (A'Obeyd, T:)
IAar is related to have said that the رَنَمَة, with ن,
is a certain species of tree: Sh knew not this
word, and supposed it to be a mistranscription
for رَتَمَة; but the رَتَم are [comparatively] large
trees, [or rather shrubs, of the broom-kind,]
having trunks; whereas the رنمة is of the slender
kind of plants [as is said above]. (T.)
