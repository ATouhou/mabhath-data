K,) by night; (JK, Msb, K) but it correctly
means, whether by night or by day; as is shown
by verse 17 of ch. xviii. of the Kur-án: (Msb:)
the assertion that it means, specially, by night, is
weak: (TA:) accord. to Lth, رُقُودٌ is by night;
and رُقَادٌ, by day: but the Arabs used both of
these words as meaning the sleeping by night and
by day. (T, TA.) You say, مَابِى رُقُودٌ and رُقادٌ

says on the authority of a gloss. in the KL: or]
