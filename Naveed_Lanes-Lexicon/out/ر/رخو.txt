[for which some say لَمْ يَرْوِ عَنَّا]: Sgh says [correctly] that they are the letters exclusive of those
termed الشَّدِيدَةُ and of those in the phrase
لم يرعونا: as is said in the M, they are thirteen;
namely, ث,ح,خ,ذ,ز,س,ش,ص,ض,ظ,غ,ف,
and ه; [to which De Sacy adds, in his Grammar,
(2nd ed. i. 29,) ا without ء, and و and ى, which
are generally included in an intermediate class
between the شديدة and the رخوة, namely, in the
class consisting of the letters in the phrase لم يرعونا
or لم يرو عنّا:] the letter termed رِخْوٌ is that in
which the sound runs on, as it does, for instance,
in the س and ش when you say المَسّ and
الرَّشّ. (TA.)

رَخِىٍ [Verily that affair passes away from me, I
being in an easy state of mind,] is said when you
are not disquieted, rendered anxious, or grieved,
by the affair. (TA.)

Hareeree's “ Durrat el-Ghowwás,” in De Sacy's
“ Anthol. Gramm. Ar,” p. 52 of the Ar. text.)
