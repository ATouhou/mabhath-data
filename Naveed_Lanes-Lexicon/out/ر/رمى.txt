from his hand; (S, TA;) as also ↓ ارمى; (M,
K;) i. e. ارمى الشَّىْءَ مِنْ يَدِهِ: (M: [in the K it
is implied that one says also بَهِ ↓ ارمى; agreeably
with a phrase mentioned in what follows:]) you
say, الحَجَرَ مِنْ يَدِى ↓ أَرْمَيْتُ I threw the stone
from my hand: (S:) and الفَرَسُ بِرَاكِبِهِ ↓ ارمى
The horse threw, or threw down, [i. e. threw off,]
his rider: (T:) رَمَيْتُ الرَّجُلَ is said إِذَا رَمَيْتَهُ بِيَدِكَ;
[i. e., as meaning رَمَيْتُهُ بِيَدِى; which may be
rendered I threw him (the man) with my hand;
and also I threw, or shot, at him (the man) with
my hand;] but when you remove him from his
place, you say, عَنِ الفَرَسِ وَغَيْرِهِ ↓ أَرْمَيْتُهُ [I threw
him, or threw him down or off, from the horse
&c.]: (Msb:) and عَنْ فَرَسِهِ ↓ طَعَنَهُ فَأَرْمَاهُ, meaning [He thrust him, or pierced him, with his
spear,] and threw him, or threw him down [or
off], from his horse: (El-Fárábee, S, Msb:) and

load from the back of the camel. (T.) وَمَا رَمَيْتَ
إِذْ رَمَيْتَ وَلٰكِنَّ اللّٰهَ رَمَى, in the Kur [viii. 17], is
said by Aboo-Is-hák to be tropical, and to mean
(tropical:)  And thou didst not cast [in effect, or] so as to
attain the point that was attained, [when thou
didst cast,] but God [cast in effect, i. e.,] overruled the casting: or, accord. to Abu-l-' Abbás,
the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  thou didst not cast fear, or
terror, into their hearts, when thou didst cast the
pebbles, [but God cast the fear, or terror:] or,
accord. to Mbr, (assumed tropical:)  thou didst not cast with thy
strength, when thou didst cast, but with the
strength of God thou didst cast [so that in effect
God cast]. (T. [See also another explanation in
what follows.]) ―
-b2-  [رَمَى بِسَلْحِهِ He cast forth his

arrow, from, and upon, meaning with, the bow;]
and accord. to El-Ghooree, بِهَا also; (Mgh;) but
one should not say رَمَى بِهَا, (S, M, Msb, K,)
unless meaning “ he threw it from his hand; ”
though some make it to mean [رَمَى عَنْهَا or] رَمَى
عَلَيْهَا, making the ب to be instead of عن or على.
(Msb.) ―
-b4-  And رَمَى القَنَصَ, (S, M,) or الصَّيْدَ,
[He shot, or shot at, the animal, or animals, of
the chase,] inf. n. رَمْىٌ and رِمَايَةٌ, (Msb,) or رَمْىٌ,
and none other. (M.) [And رَمَاهُ بِكَذَا He threw
at him, cast at him, or shot at him, with such a
thing; i. e. he threw it, cast it, or shot it, at him:
and, more commonly, he threw at him, or cast at
him, and hit him, or he shot him, with such a
thing: namely, with a stone, an arrow, &c. And
رَمَاهُ بِحِجَارَةً He threw at him with stones, threw

aim at, and smite, with some bane, or malady,
his hand, or arm, and his nose,] and in like
manner in relation to other members. (M, K. *)
[And رَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ بِكَذَا, sometimes meaning (assumed tropical:)  God
smote him, or afflicted him, with such a thing:

with such a thing; as in the saying,] رَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ
بِدَآءِ الذِّئْبِ (assumed tropical:)  [May God smite him, or afflict him,
with the disease of the wolf]; a prov., meaning
may God destroy him, or cause him to perish;
because [it is said that] the wolf has no disease
but death: or, as some say, the meaning is, رَمَاهُ
اللّٰهُ بِالجُوعِ [may God afflict him with hunger];
because the wolf is always hungry. (Meyd.) And
رَمَاهُ بِدَاهِيَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [He (God) sent upon him, or against
him,. or smote him with, a calamity: and also]
(assumed tropical:)  he (a man) made a very sagacious and crafty
and politic man to be his assailant. (L in art.
حجر. [See also, in that art., رُمِىَ فُلَانٌ بِحَجِرِ
الأَرْضِ, and بِحَجَرِهِ.]) [And رَمَاهُ بِكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He assailed him with such a thing; as, for instance,
reproach, and an argument, &c. Hence,] رَمَاهُ
بِقَبِيحٍ, (TA,) or بِأَمْرٍ قَبِيحٍ, (IAar, T,) or بِالقَبِيحِ,
(Msb,) (assumed tropical:)  He reproached him, or upbraided him,
with a thing, or with that, which was bad, evil,
abominable, or foul: (IAar, T, Msb, TA:) whence

being understood,] in the Kur xxiv. 4 and 6. (T,

evil: see مَرْمِىٌّ. And رَمَاهُ alone (assumed tropical:)  He accused
him, or suspected him.] And رَمَاهُ بِالحَقِّ (assumed tropical:)  [He

enemy, and work [good] for thee: (AO, S, TA: *)
and رَمَى اللّٰهُ لَهُ (tropical:)  God aided him, or aided him
against his enemy, (AAF, M, K, TA,) and
wrought [good] for him: (AAF, M, TA:) and
[it is said that] the verb has this meaning in the
words of the Kur, وَمَا رَمَيْتَ إِذْ رَمَيْتَ وَلٰكِنَّ اللّٰهَ رَمَى
[of which other explanations have been given
above]; because, when God aids a person against
his enemy, He aims at, and smites, (يَرْمِى,) that
enemy. (M, TA.) [In like manner, also, فُلَانٌ
يَرْمِى مِنْ وَرَآءِ فُلَانٍ means (assumed tropical:)  Such a one defends

what follows.] رَمْىٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  The going
forth from one country, or the like, to another.
(Th, M, TA.) And رَمَى الرَّجُلُ (assumed tropical:)  The man journeyed. (IAar, T, TA.) And Az says, (TA,) I
heard an Arab of the desert say to another, أَيْنَ
تَرْمِى, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Whither dost thou direct thy
course. (T, TA.) One says, رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا يَرْمُونَ
الطَّائِفَ (assumed tropical:)  I saw men directing their course to, or

imposed an impost upon his subjects: see رَمِيَّةٌ.]
―
-b13-  And رَمَى, aor. يَرْمِى, means also (assumed tropical:)  He misconjectured; thought wrongly; or formed a wrong
opinion: (IAar, T:) [and app. he threw out a

adds,] it is like the phrase رَجْمًا بِالغَيْبِ [or رَجَمَ
بِالغَيْبِ or قَالَ رَجْمًا بِالغَيْبِ]. (T.) ―
-b14-  رَمَى السَّحَابُ:
see 6. ―
-b15-  رَمَى عَلَى الخَمْسِينَ: see 4.

inf. n. مُرَامَاةٌ and رِمَآءٌ (T, S, K) and ↓ تَرْمَآءٌ, (K,)
or this last is like the two preceding ns. [in meaning, but is a quasi-inf. n.], (T,) [I threw, or shot,
(generally the latter,) and I shot arrows, with
him, or at him; (see 6;) mostly meaning in
competition, or contention; i. e. I competed, or
contended, with him, in throwing, or shooting,
and in shooting arrows: and رَامَيْتُهُ alone often
means رَامَيْتُهُ بِالحِجَارَةِ, or بِالسِّهَامِ; whence it is
said that] مُرَامَاةٌ signifies the shooting arrows,
and throwing stones, with any one. (KL.) It is
said in a prove., respecting an affair in which one
is forward before doing it,
قَبْلَ الرِّمَآءِ تُمْلَأُ الكَنَائِنُ
[Before shooting arrows with another, or doing

-b2-  and
see also 6.
-A2-  ارمى, (M, Mgh,) inf. n. إِرْمَآءٌ,
(Mgh,) also signifies It (a thing, Mgh) exceeded.
(M, Mgh.) You say, ارمى عَلَيْهِ It (anything)

وَأَسْمَرَ خَطِّيًّا كَأَنَّ كُعُوبَهُ
نَوَى القَسْبِ قَدْ أَرْمَى ذِرَاعًا عَلَى العَشْرِ
[And a tawny spear of El-Khatt, as though its
knots, or joints, were hard date-stones; one that
exceeded a cubit over the ten]: (T, S:) i. e.,
قَدْ زَادَ عَلَيْهَا. (T.) And hence, (T,) you say,
ارمى عَلَى الخَمْسِينَ, i. e. He exceeded [the age of
fifty]; (AZ, A 'Obeyd, T, S, M, K;) [like اربى;]
as also ↓ رَمَى; (AZ, T, S, M, K;) [for] رَمْىٌ signifies the exceeding in age: and one says also
أَرْمَأَ and رَمَأَ in the same sense. (IAar, T.) And
ارمى فُلَانٌ signifies the same as أَرْبَى [meaning
Such a one took usury or the like]. (S.) See also
رَمَآءٌ, below. You say also, سَابَّهُ فَأَرْمَى عَلَيْهِ, i. e.

and] he exceeded him. (S.)

was made a captive in the Time of Ignorance,
and the case] came eventually, and led, [to his
becoming the property of Khadeejeh, (إِلَى being
understood before أَنْ صَارَ,)] as though the decrees
[of God] cast him thereto. (IAth, TA.) One
says also, ترامى الأَمْرُ, meaning تَرَاخَى [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The
affair was sluggish, or backward]: (K:) [or]
one says of a [purulent swelling such as is termed]
حِيْن, (T,) or of a wound, (S,) ترامى إِلَى فَسَادٍ,

رَمْيَةٌ A single throw, or cast, or fling: and a

TA.) رُبَّ رَمْيَةٍ مِنْ غَيْرِ رَامٍ [Many a hitting shot,
or scarce any hitting shot, is there without a
skilled shooter] is a prov. [applied to the case of
an unexpected success obtained by an inexperienced
person;] meaning many a [hitting] shot, or scarce

[usually] misses. (Meyd)
رَمَآءٌ, (S, IAth, K, in a copy of the T and in a
copy of the S without any vowel-sign,) with
fet-h and medd, (IAth, and so in a copy of the S,
in which it is added that it is said by Ks to be
with medd,) like سَمَآءٌ; (K;) or ↓ رِمَآءٌ; (Mgh,

shown by what follows]; (M;) An excess, or an
addition; i. e., (A 'Obeyd, T, Mgh,) i. q. رِبًا,
(A 'Obeyd, T, S, M, K,) or رِبًوا, (Mgh, and thus
written in some copies of the S and K, or in
most of the copies of the K, [meaning usury, and
the like,]) or an excess, or addition, over what is
lawful. (T, IAth.) Hence the trad. of 'Omar,
لَا تَبِيعُوا, (A 'Obeyd, T,) or he said لَا تَشْتَرُوا, (S,)
الذَّهَبَ بِالفِضَّةِ إِلَّا يَدًا بِيَدٍ هَا وَهَا, [or هَأْ وَهَأْ, (see
art. هوأ,)] or هَآء وَهَآء, [i. e. هَآءَ وَهَآءَ,] (accord. to
different copies of the T and S,) adding, (T, S,)
إِنِّى أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمُ الرمآءَ; (T, S, Mgh;) [i. e. Exchange not ye gold for silver, except it be done
hand with hand, meaning, except there be no
delay between the giving and receiving, take and
take: verily I fear for you the practice of usury;]
or he said, إِلَّا هَآءَ وَهَآءِ, meaning, except [by saying]
take and give: (Az, TA in باب الالف الليّنة:)
and, as some relate it, he said, انّى اخاف عليكم
↓ الإرْمَآءَ; [which means the same;] using the
inf. n. (T, Mgh.)
رِمَآءٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
رَمِىٌّ, applied to the male of the goat-kind, or
mountain-goat, or of the gazelle, [and any male
animal of the chase,] and likewise, without ة, to
the female, i. q. ↓ مَرْمِىٌّ [i. e. Thrown at, or cast
at, or shot at, or shot]: but when they do not
distinguish a male from a female, the word applied to the male and to the female is [↓ رَمِيَّةٌ,]
with ة [added لِلنَّقْلِ, i. e. to transfer it from the
category of epithets to that of substantives]: or,
accord. to Lh, رَمِىٌّ and ↓ رَمِيَّةٌ are both applied,
as epithets, to the female; but the former is the
more approved: the pl. of the former [and of the
latter also] is رَمَايَا. (M, TA.)
-A2-  Also, (M,)
accord. to As, i. q. سَقِىٌّ, i. e., (T, S,) A cloud of
which the rain-drops are large, and vehement in
their fall, (T, S, M, K, *) of the clouds of the hot
season and of the autumn: (S:) or, (M, K,)
accord. to Lth, (T,) small portions of clouds, (T,
M, K,) of the [apparent] size of the hand, or
somewhat larger; but the approved explanation
is that given by As: (T:) and ↓ رَمْىٌ is a dial. var.
thereof: (TA:) the pl. is أَرْمِيَةٌ, (T, S, M, K,) like
as that of سَقِىٌّ is أَسْقِيَةٌ, (S,) and أَرْمآءٌ, (Lth, T,
M, K,) [each, properly, a pl. of pauc.,] and رَمَايَا.
(M, K.)
رَمِيَّةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two
places. [As a subst.,] it signifies A thing, (S, M,)
meaning (S) an animal (As, T, S, M, * Mgh, Msb)
of the chase, (As, T, S,) that is thrown at, or cast
at, or shot at, or shot, (As, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb,)
by its pursuer; and any beast thrown at, cast at,
shot at, or shot; (As, T;) applied to the male and
the female: (As, T, Mgh, Msb:) it is originally a
word of the measure فَعِلَيةٌ in the sense of the
measure مَفْعُولَةٌ: (Msb:) [or rather] it is made
fem., (As, T,) [i. e.] it has ة, (S,) because it is
made a subst., (As, T, S,) not an epithet: (As, T:)
it is not مَرْمِيَّةٌ converted into رَمِيَّةٌ: (S:) or, accord.
to Sb, the ة, in general, is affixed to show that
the act has not yet been executed upon the object
thereof; [so that the meaning is, an animal to be
thrown at, cast at, shot at, or shot;] and thus
ذَبِيحَةٌ is applied to “ a sheep, or goat, [to be
slaughtered or sacrificed,] not yet slaughtered [or
sacrificed]; ” but when the act has been executed
upon it, it is [said to be] ذَبِيحٌ: (M:) the pl. is
رَمِيَّاتٌ and رَمَايَا. (Msb.) One says, بِئْسَ الرَّمِيَّةُ
الأَرْنَبُ, meaning Very bad is the thing of those
that are [or are to be] thrown at, or cast at, or shot
at, or shot, the hare. (S, M.) ―
-b2-  Also, (assumed tropical:)  An
impost which the governor imposes [so I render
مَا يَرْمِيهِ العَامِلُ] upon his subjects. (TA.)
رِمِّيَّا, (S, TA,) thus correctly written, like عِمِّيَّا;
in the copies of the K like عِمِيَّا, (TA,) [and in
two copies of the T written رِمِيَّا; in a copy of the
M, رِمِّيَا;] i. q. تَرَامٍ: (T, S: *) or مُرَامَاةٌ: (K:) or
رَمْىٌ: (M:) or it is an intensive inf. n. from
الرَّمْىُ, of the measure فِعِّيلَى, like هِجِّيَرى and
خِصِّيصَى: (Nh, TA:) one says, كَانَتْ بَيْنَهُمْ رِمِّيَّا
(T, * S, M, * TA) ثُمَّ حَجَزَتْ بَيْنَهُمْ حِجِّيزَى, (T,)
or ثُمَّ صَارُوا إِلَى حِجِّيزَى, (S, TA,) i. e. There was
between them a reciprocal throwing of stones, (T,
TA,) [or shooting of arrows or the like, or a
great, or vehement, throwing, &c.,] then there
intervened between them [an intervention, or a
vehement intervention, or] a person, or persons,
who withheld them, one from another, (T,) or
then they withheld themselves, [or withheld themselves much,] one from another. (TA.)
رَامٍ act. part. n. of 1; (Lth, T, TA;) Throwing,
&c.: (TA:) [pl. رُمَاةٌ.] ―
-b2-  [Hence, الرَّامِى a name
of The constellation Sagittarius; the ninth of the
signs of the zodiac: thus called in the present
day; but more commonly, القَوْسُ.] ―
-b3-  [Hence
likewise,] رَامٍ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  [One who assails
with reproach, &c.:] (assumed tropical:)  one who reproaches, or
upbraids; or who gives an ill name: (KL:)
[(assumed tropical:)  one who accuses, or suspects, another: see

shooting arrows; (KL;) the place of the butt at
which arrows are shot: (TA:) [pl. مَرَامٍ.] ―

object, to, or towards, which one directs his aim
or course]: (TA, and Har p. 54:) pl. مَرَامٍ: (Har
ibid.:) whence the trad., لَيْسَ وَرَآءَ اللّٰهِ مَرْمًى, i. e.
(assumed tropical:)  [There is not, beyond God,] any object (مَقْصِد)
towards which to direct hopes. (TA.)
مِرْمًى An instrument for throwing, or casting,
or shooting: pl. مَرَامٍ. (Har p. 54.) [Hence,]
مَرَامِى نِيرَانٍ [Engines for throwing fire upon the
enemy]. (S and K voce حَرَّاقَةٌ.) [See also مِرْمَاةٌ.]
مَرْمَاةٌ i. q. غَلْوَةٌ [as meaning The limit of a shot
or throw]. (K in art. غلو.)
-A2-  See also the next
paragraph.
مِرْمَاةٌ An arrow with which one shoots (As,
IAar, T) at a butt: (As, T, Mgh:) an arrow
with which one learns to shoot; (M, K, TA;)
which is the worst kind of arrows: (TA:) or a
small, weak arrow: (AHn, M, K:) or an arrow
with its [head of] iron: (Th, TA in art. حسب:)
or, like سِرْوَةٌ, a round arrow-head: (AA, [so in
the S, but in the TA it is IAar,] S, TA:) [and
app. a missile of any kind: (see مِرْدًى:)] pl.
مَرَامٍ. (M.) When they see many مَرَامٍ in the
quiver of a man, they say,
وَنَبْلُ العَبْدِ أَكْثَرُهَا المَرَامِى
[And the arrows of the slave, most of them are
those that are small and weak]: a prov., said to
mean that the free man purchases arrows at a
high price, buying the broad and long iron head,
because he is a man of war and of the chase; but
the slave is only a pastor, and therefore is content
with what are termed مَرَامٍ, because they are
cheaper if he buy them; and if he ask for them
as a gift, no one gives him aught but a مِرْمَاة.
(M.) [See also the last sentence of this paragraph.] ―
-b2-  It is also used, tropically, as meaning
(tropical:)  A مَنْجَنِيق [or kind of engine for casting stones
at the enemy; app. such as was called by the
Romans “ onager,” or the like thereof]: because,
like the مِرْمَاْة before mentioned, it is an instrument for casting, or shooting. (Mgh.) [See also
مِرْمًى.] And [the pl.] مَرَامٍ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  Thunderbolts; syn. صَوَاعِقُ. (Bd in xviii. 38.) ―
-b3-  Also
A cloven hoof (S, Mgh, K) of a sheep or goat;
because it is of the things that are thrown
away: (Mgh:) [or,] accord. to A 'Obeyd, (T, S,)
a thing that is between the two hoofs of a sheep
or goat; (T, S, M, K;) as also ↓ مَرْمَاةٌ: (A 'Obeyd,
T, M, K:) thus, he says, it is explained; but I
know not what is its meaning: (T, S:) its dual
occurs in the following trad.: لَوْ أَنَّ أَحَدَهُمْ دُعِىَ
إِلَى مِرْمَاتَيْنِ لَأَجَابَ وَهُوَ لَا يُجِيبُ إِلَى الصَّلَاةِ;
(T, S; related also, with some variations, in the
M and Mgh;) in which it is said to be the dual
of مِرْمَاةٌ in the former of these two senses; [i. e.
If any one of you were invited to partake of two
hoofs of a sheep or goat, he would obey the invitation, but he will not obey the invitation to
prayer;] (S, Mgh;) or, accord. to A 'Obeyd, it
is here the dual of this word in the latter of the
same two senses: (T, S:) accord. to IAar, (T,
TA,) or Aboo-Sa'eed, it here means the kind of
arrow called مِرْمَاةٌ: (T, Mgh, TA:) but in another, and similar, trad., مرماتين is followed by
أَوْعَرْقٍ [i. e. “ or a bone with some meat remaining
upon it ”]. (T, Z, TA.)
مَرْمِىٌّ pass. part. n. of 1; Thrown, &c.: (TA:)
[thrown at, or cast at, or shot at, or shot:] see رَمِىٌّ.
―
-b2-  [Hence, (assumed tropical:)  Smitten, or afflicted, with some bane,
or malady, &c.: (assumed tropical:)  assailed with reproach, &c.:
(assumed tropical:)  reproached, or upbraided, or stigmatized with
an ill name: (assumed tropical:)  accused, or suspected.] You say
اِمْرَأَةٌ مَرْمِيَّةٌ بِسُوْءٍ (assumed tropical:)  A woman accused, or suspected,
of evil. (TA in art. رطم.)
مُرْتَمٍ A scout (T, K) لِقَوْمٍ [to a people or party]:
(T, K: *) and so مُرْتَبِئٌ. (T.)
