العِظَامَ وَلَا تَعْرِفُ قَدْرَ اسْتِهَا تَأْكُلُهَا ثُمَّ يَعْسُرُ عَلَيْهَا

but knows not the size of its anus: it eats them;
then their exit becomes difficult to it]. (A.) ―

intrans. as well as trans., (K, * TA,) It was, or
became, broken, broken in pieces, crushed, bruised,
brayed, or pounded: (M, K:) said of a bone;
i. e., it became what is termed رُفَاتٌ. (M.) And
It became cut or broken, cut off or broken off;
it broke, or broke off: (K, TA:) the former is
said, in this sense, of a rope. (A, TA.)
رُفَتٌ i. q. تِبْنٌ [i. e. Straw; or straw that has
been trodden, or thrashed, and cut: also written
رُفَّةٌ, and رُفَةٌ, and رُفَةٌ]. (IAar, T, K.) It is said
in a prov., أَنَا أَغْنَى عَنْكَ مِنَ التُّفَهِ عَنِ الرُّفَتِ,
(TA,) or إِلَى الرُّفَتِ (T,) [I am more free from
the want of thee than the badger is from the want
of straw, or cut straw]: the تفه is what is called
عَنَاقُ الأَرْضِ, which has a canine tooth, and does
not procure for itself straw nor herbage; and the
word is written with ه; but الرفت is with ت:
(T:) or, accord. to ISk, the two words are correctly without teshdeed, and with the radical ه.

pieces with the hand; (A, TA;) or a thing that
has become old and worn out, and crumbled, or

مَرْفُوتٌ:]) or broken, or crumbled, particles;
fragments, or crumbs; of a thing that is dry,
(T, S, A, K, TA,) of any kind; (T;) [as, for
instance,] of musk. (A, TA.) Hence, in the Kur
[xvii. 52 and 100], أَئِذَا كُنَّا عِظَامًا وَرُفَاتًا When
we shall have become bones and broken particles?
(S, M, TA.) [Hence also the phrase] لَا بِرْفَاتِكَ,
meaning No, by thy ancestors who have become
broken and crumbled bones in the dust. (Har
p. 634.) And [hence one says,] هُوَ الَّذِى أَعَادَ
المَكَارِمَ وَأَحْيَا رُفَاتَهَا وَأَنْشَرَ أَمْوَاتَهَا (tropical:)  [He is the person
who has restored generous qualities or actions,
and revived such of them as had decayed, and
brought to life again such of them as had become
dead]. (A, TA.)
مَرْفُوتٌ Broken, broken in pieces, &c. (Akh, S.
[See رُفَاتٌ.])
