ركو1
رَكَا (ISd, K,) [aor. يَرْكُو,] inf. n. رَكْوٌ,
(ISd, TA,) He dug, or excavated, (ISd, K, TA,)
the ground, forming an oblong hollow. (ISd,
TA.) ―
-b2-  He made, formed, or fashioned, in a

is termed مَرْكُوّ, (AZ, TA,) or a watering-trough
[in an absolute sense]; as also ↓ اركى. (TA.)

أَرْكَوَ see what next precedes.
رَكْوَةٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.) and رِكْوَةٌ and
رُكْوَةٌ, (K,) all well known, but the first is the
most chaste, (MF,) A certain thing for water:
(S:) it is [a small drinking-vessel] like a تَوْر, of
leather; (ISd, TA;) a small drinking-vessel of
skin: (Nh, TA:) or a small دَلْو [or bucket,
generally of leather], (Mgh, Msb,) well known:
(Msb:) all of these explanations have been
strangely neglected by the author of the K:
(TA:) pl. رِكَآءٌ (S, Mgh, Msb) and رَكَوَاتٌ; (S,)
Msb;) the latter allowable. (Msb.) The prov.
(S) صَارَتِ القَوْسُ رَكْوَةً [lit. The bow became a
ركوة, app. meaning the bow became exchanged
for a vessel such as is called ركوة, but see what
follows,] is applied in relation to the retiring of
good fortune, and reverse in the state of affairs.
(S, K.) ―
-b2-  A small زَوْرَق [or skiff]. (ISd, K.)
―
-b3-  A رُقْعَة [or piece of cloth, or rag,] beneath the
عَوَاصِر, (K,) which means three stones [with
which grapes are pressed so as to force out the
juice,] placed one above another: so in the M.
(TA.) [Hence, accord. to the TK, the prov.
above mentioned: but I see not why.] ―
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  The
فَلْهَم of a woman; i. e. her فَرْج [or vulva]: so in
the copies of the K: but in the T, her قُلْفَة [i. e.
the prepuce of the clitoris], on the authority of
IAar; as being likened to the ركوة of water:
(TA:) the pl. [app. in all its senses] is رِكَآءٌ and
رَكَوَاتٌ [as above], (K,) or in the last sense رُكًى.
(TA.)
رَكِىٌّ: see what next follows, in two places.
رَكِيَّةٌ A well: (S, Msb, K:) or a well containing water; (MA;) otherwise a well is not
thus called: (Durrat el-Ghowwás, in De Sacy's
Chrest. Ar. ii. 332:) or a well not made neat; or
not constructed [or cased] with bricks [&c.]:
(MA:) pl. رَكَايَا (S, Msb, K) and ↓ رَكِىٌّ, (S,
and so in some copies of the K,) or the former is
the pl. and ↓ the latter is [properly speaking] a
gen. n., [i. e. a coll. gen. n.,] and often occurs as
a sing. and as a pl., (Nh, TA,) or the pl. is also
رُكِىٌّ: (so in some copies of the K and in the
TA:) accord. to ISd, it is from رَكَا in the first of
the senses assigned to this verb above. (TA.)
مَرْكُوٌّ [pass. part. n. of 1: ―
-b2-  and hence, as a
subst.,] A large watering-trough or tank: (AA,
T, S, K:) [in the S and K is added, وَالجُرْمُوزُ الصَّغِيرُ,
which may mean either that the small watering-
trough is called جرموز, and such is the case, or
that مَرْكُوٌّ also signifies a small جرموز, agreeably
with what here follows, and with an explanation
of this word in the TA voce حَوِىٌّ:] Az, after
mentioning AA's explanation given above, says,
but what I have heard from the Arabs is, that the
مركوّ is a small watering-trough or tank, which
a man makes, or forms, or  fashions, in a suitable
manner, with his hands, at the head of the well,
when he has not, and cannot procure, a vessel in
which to give water to a camel or to two camels:
and that which is large is not thus called. (TA.)
[But see an ex. voce سَلْسٌ.]
