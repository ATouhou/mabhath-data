رمنرُمَّانٌ [The pomegranate;] a certain fruit, (T,)
the produce of a certain tree, (M,) well known:
(T, S, M, K:) n. un. with ة: (S, M, Msb, K:)
the sweet sort thereof relaxes the state of the
bowels, and cough; the sour sort has the contrary
effect; and that which is between sweet and sour
is good for inflammation of the stomach, and
pain of the heart: the رمّان has six flavours,
like the apple; and is commended for its delicacy,
its quick dissolving, and its niceness, or its elegance:
(K:) رُمَّانٌ is of the measure فُعْلَانٌ accord. to Sb:
(M in art. رم:) Kh, being asked by Sb respecting الرُّمَّان, (S,) or [rather] respecting رُمَّان, (M in
art. رم,) when used as a proper name, (S,) said that
he declined it imperfectly (S, M) when [thus made]
determinate; (S;) and that he made it to accord
to the majority, because its derivation is unknown,
(S, M, *) i. e., that he regarded its ا and ن as augmentative: (S:) but accord. to Akh, the ن is
radical, (S,) [i. e.] he held it to be of the measure فُعَّالٌ, making it to accord to many similar
names of plants, (M,) like حُمَّاضٌ &c., (S, M,)
فُعَّالٌ being more common than فُعْلَان; (S;) he
meant, as applied to plants; for otherwise the
contr. is the case: (TA:) [Fei says,] the measure
is فُعَّالٌ, the ن being radical, and therefore the
word is perfectly decl., unless when used as a
proper name, in which case it is imperfectly decl.,
being made to accord to the majority [of proper
names ending with ا and ن, as عُثْمَانُ &c.].
(Msb.) [Freytag mentions several varieties of
رمّان, as follows: but the names, as given by him
and here transcribed, require verification or correction: “ رمان القسطيسى, رمان المرسى, رمان
العدسى, رمان الخزاينى, رمان الترحين, رمان
المرونى, qui ad speciem dulcium pertinent: tum
رمان شعرى dulce et corticem tenuissimum habens:
رمان امليسى Malum Punicum maximum, esu
gratissimum et acinorum expers: رمان السحى,
رمان الدلوى, رمان الدوارى, sunt minoris magnitudinis, formæ rotundæ: رمان السفريا Malum
Punicum magnitudine et sapore præstantissimum,
a viro Sefri dicto ita appellatum, quod a Syria
Cordubam regnante Abd-Alrahmano hanc speciem
transtulerat: ” and he refers to “ Casiri, Bibl. Ar.
Hisp. T. i. p. 329; and Avicenn. L. ii. p. 254; ”
the latter of which authors only mentions the
properties of the رمّان.] ―
