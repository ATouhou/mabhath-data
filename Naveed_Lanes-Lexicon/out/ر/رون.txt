رون1
رَانَ, [aor. يَرُونُ,] inf. n. رَوْنٌ It (an affair,
or event,) was, or became, hard, difficult, or
severe. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And رَانَتْ لَيْلَتُنَا Our night was,
or became, very cloudy and hot. (Th, M, TA.)
-A2-  See also رَانَ in art. رين.
رَوْنٌ, (so accord. to a copy of the T, [if correct,
an inf. n. used as a simple subst., see above, first
sentence,]) or ↓ رُونٌ, (so in another copy of the
T, and accord. to the K,) with damm, (K,)
Hardness, difficulty, severity, vehemence, or intenseness: (T, K:) pl. رُؤُونٌ, (T, and so in a copy
of the K,) or رُؤُونٌ. (CK.) [See also رُونَةٌ.]
-A2-
رَوْنٌ signifies [or signifies also] The furthest part
of a مَشَارَة [q. v.]. (Yoo, K.)
رُونٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
رُونَةٌ The greater, main, principal, or chief,
part of a thing. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  And Hardness,
difficulty, or severity, of a thing, or an affair,
or event; and grievousness thereof: so in the saying, كَشَفَ اللّٰهُ عَنْكَ رُونَةَ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ [May God
remove from thee the hardness, &c., and the grievousness, of this thing, or affair, or event]. (M.)
[See also رَوْنٌ.] ―
-b3-  And The utmost limit, reach,
or degree, of a thing, in respect of heat, or cold,
or in other respects, as when said of grief, or of
war, or the like: and hence is said to be taken
the name الرُّنَةُ [or رُنَةُ, without ال, (see الرُّنَّى, in
art. رن,) as though it were a contraction of رُونَة,]
given to [the month] Jumádà-l-Ákhireh, because
of its intense cold [when it was so named]. (TA.)
أَرْوَنَانٌ: see the opinions of IAar and Sb respecting its derivation in art. رن. [It is said in
the S and K in art. نبج, that there is no word
like it except أَنْبَجَانٌ.] You say يَوْمٌ أَرْوَنَانٌ (T,
S, M, K) and ↓ أَرْوُنَانِىٌّ, (S, M,) and لَيْلَةٌ أَرْوَنَانَةٌ
(T, S, M, K) and ↓ أَرْوَنَانِيَّةٌ, (M,) A day, and a
night, hard, difficult, severe, distressing, or grievous: (S, K, * TA:) or vehemently hot and grievous: (T, TA:) or that has reached the utmost
point, or degree, in respect of joy, or grief, or
heat: or hard, difficult, or severe, in respect of
everything; in respect of heat, or cold, or clamour,
cries, shouts, or noises [&c.]. (M, TA.) You
say also يَوْمُ أَرْوَنَانٍ, [virtually] meaning the same:
(K:) [or this may mean A day of clamour, &c.;
as will be seen from what follows.] ↓ يَوْمُ أَرْوَنَانِى
occurs at the end of a verse of a rájiz: this may
be [by poetic license] for يَوْمُ أَرْوَنَانٍ, or for يَوْمُ
أَرْوَانَانِىٍّ: and ↓ يَوْمٌ أَرْوَنَانِى occurs at the end of a
verse of En-Nábighah El-Jaadee, for يَوْمٌ أَرْوَنَانِىٌّ.
(S.) Accord. to Sh, as is said in the T, (TA,)
يَوْمٌ أَرْوَنَانٌ, (K, TA,) as also يَوْمُ أَرْوَنَانٍ, (K,)
signifies A day that is easy, (K, TA,) or pleasant: (TA:) thus having two contr. meanings:
(K:) and Sh cited a verse of En-Nábighah ElJaadee as an ex.: but AHeyth disallowed ارونان
as having any other meaning than grief, and
difficulty or the like; and he disallowed also the
verse cited by Sh [as being an ex. of the meaning
that he assigned to it]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also A voice,
or sound: (S, K:) and cries, shouts, or noises,
and clamour. (TA. [In one place, in the TA,
رون, thus written, without any vowel-sign, has
also this latter meaning assigned to it: but the
context seems to show that this is a mistranscription.])
أَرْوَنَانِىٌّ; and its fem., with ة; and أَرْوَنَانِى: see
the next preceding paragraph, in four places.
هُوَ مَرُونٌ بِهِ He is overcome, subdued, or subjected. (K.) [مَرُونٌ here is a contraction of
مَرْوُونٌ, from رَانَ having for its aor. يَرُونُ as a
dial. var. of رَانَ having for its aor. يَرِينُ: see
art. رين.]
