ردبإِرْدَبٌّ A well-known مِكْيَال [or measure with
which corn is measured], (T,) a large مِكْيَال,
(S, M, K,) in Egypt, (K,) [i. e.] of the people of
Egypt; (T, S;) or a certain measure of capacity
well known in Egypt; (Msb;) not correctly called
a مِكْيَال for they do not measure with it, but with
the وَيْبَة: (IB, TA:) it comprises, (يَضُمُّ, [so in
the M, but in copies of the K وَيُضَمُّ, which signifies that it is also pronounced with damm,]) as
they say, (M,) or it takes, (T,) twenty-four times
the measure called صَاع, (T, M, Msb, K,) of wheat,
(T,) i. e. sixty-four times the measure called مَنّ,
(T, Msb,) the منّ here meant being the منّ of
our country, (Az, [app. meaning El-'Irák,]) and
the صاع being that of the Prophet: (Msb:) or
six وَيْبَات: (K:) the اردبّ of Egypt is six وَيْبَات;
the وَيْبَة being four أَرْبَاع; the رُبْع, four أَقْدَاح; and
the قَدَح, two hundred and thirty-two دَرَاهِم: (EsSuyootee in his “ Husn el-Mohádarah:”) the
half of the اردبّ is called قَنْقَلٌ: (T:) the word
اردبّ is affirmed by some to be arabicized: (MF:)
[it is now vulgarly pronounced أَرْدَبّ:] the pl. is
أَرَادِبُ. (Msb.) El-Akhtal says,
قَوْمٌ إِذَا اسْتَنْبَحَ الأَضْيَافُ كَلْبَهُمُ
قَالُوا لِأُمِّهِمُ بُولِى عَلَى النَّارِ
وَالخُبْزُ كَالعَنْبَرِ الهِنْدِىِّ عِنْدَهُمُ
وَالقَمْحُ سَبْعُونَ إِرْدَبًّا بِدِينَارِ
[Persons who, when the guests induce their dog
to bark, (see art. نبح,) say to their mother,
“ Make water on the fire: ” and bread is like
Indian ambergris in their judgment, while wheat
is seventy irdebbs for a deenár]: the former of
these two verses [whereof the latter only is cited
in the S] is said by As and others to be the most
severely-satirical verse uttered by any of the Arabs.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Also A conduit in which water flows
upon the surface of the ground. (M, K.)
إِرْدَبَّةٌ A wide بَالُوعَة [or sink-hole] made of baked
clay: (T, K:) likened to the مِكْيَال above mentioned: pl. as above. (T.) [And Any pipe of
baked clay: pl. إِرْدَبَّاتٌ: see دَاخِنَةٌ.] ―
-b2-  And i. q.
قِرْمِيدَةٌ [which may mean A large baked brick, or
a thing made of baked clay]: (M, TA:) or large
baked bricks; (S, K, TA;) which are called
قِرْمِيدٌ. (S, TA.)
