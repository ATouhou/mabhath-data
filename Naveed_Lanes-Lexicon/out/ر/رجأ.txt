S, Mgh, K,) and a person; (TA;) as also ارجى:
(ISk, S, Mgh, Msb, K:) but the former is the
better: the inf. n. is إِرْجَآءٌ. (TA.) It is said in
the Kur [xxxiii. 51], accord. to different readings,
تُرْجِىءُ مَنْ تَشَآءُ مِنْهُنَّ or تُرْجِى, meaning Thou
mayest put off whom thou wilt of them: addressed
peculiarly to the Prophet, exclusively of others of
his people. (Zj, TA.) [See also an ex. in the
Kur vii. 108 and xxvi. 35; and the various
readings mentioned by Bd in the former instance.]
-A2-  أَرْجَأَتْ She (a camel, S, K, and in like manner a pregnant female [of any kind], TA) was, or
became, near to bringing forth; as also أَرْجَتْ:
(S, K:) AA says the former. (S.)
-A3-  And ارجأ
He (a hunter or sportsman) was unsuccessful,
getting no game; as also ارجى: (K, TA:) or you
say, ارجأ الصَّيْدَ, (TA in art. رجو,) and ارجى

مُرْجَأٌ [pass. part. n. of 4]. It is said in the Kur
[ix. 107], (S, K,) as some read, (S,) وَآخَرُونَ,
مُرْجَؤُونَ لِأَمْرِ اللّٰهِ, (S, K,) or, as others read,
مُرْجَوْنَ, (S,) meaning [And others are] delayed
[for the execution of the decree of God,] until
God shall cause to betide them what He willeth.
(S, K.)
مُرْجِىءٌ [act. part. n. of أَرْجَأَ], (S, K,) and مُرْجٍ
[act. part. n. of أَرْجَى], (S, [in which, however, it
is not clearly shown whether the author means
that this corresponds to مُرْجِىءٌ or that it is a rel.
n. corresponding to مُرْجِئِىٌّ, the former being certainly the case,]) or not thus, but مُرْجِىٌّ, (K,) so
some say, (TA,) but this is a rel. n. like مرْجِئِىٌّ,
(IB, TA,) A man who is one of [the sect called]
↓ المُرْجِئَةُ (S, K) and المُرْجِيَةُ, without teshdeed to
the ى (K,) accord. to J, المُرْجِيَّةُ, with teshdeed,
(IB,) but this is incorrect, unless as meaning
those who are called in relation to the مُرْجِيَة, for
otherwise it is not allowable. (IB, TA.) The
sect called the ↓ مُرْجِئَة [and مُرْجِيَة] are [A sect of
Muslim antinomians;] a sect of Muslims who
assert that faith (الإِيمَان) consists in words without works; as though they postponed works to
words; asserting that if they do not pray nor
fast, their faith will save them: (TA:) a sect
who assert that disobedience, with faith, does not
injure; and that obedience, with disbelief, does
not profit: (KT:) or a sect who do not pronounce
judgment upon any one for aught in the present
life, but defer judgment to the day of resurrection: (Msb:) those who decide not, against the
committers of great sins, aught as to pardon or
punishment; deferring the judgment respecting
such sins to the day of resurrection. (Mgh in
art. جهم.) ―
-b2-  مُرْجِىءٌ is also applied to a she-camel, and a pregnant female [of any kind], as
meaning Near to bringing forth; and so مُرْجِئَةٌ.

two places.
