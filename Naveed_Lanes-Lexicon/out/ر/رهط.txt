نَحْنُ ذَوُو ارْتِهَاطٍ We are collected together,
or congregated; as also ↓ نَحْنُ ذَوُو رَهْطٍ: (K,
TA:) [the last word in each of these phrases
being an inf. n.; unless that in the latter be a
mistake for أَرْهُطٍ, (a pl. of رَهْطٌ,) which I find put
in the place of رَهْطٍ in a MS. copy of the K:]
from Ibn-'Abbád. (TA.) ―
-b2-  In a trad. occurs
the phrase, فَأَيْقَظَنَا وَنَحْنُ ارْتِهَاطٌ [And he waked
us,] we being parties collected together, or congregated: the last word being an inf. n. put in
the place of the verb [or rather of the part. n., or
for ذَوُو ارَتِهَاطٍ]. (TA.)
رَهْطٌ (Lth, S, Msb, K, &c.) and ↓ رَهَطٌ, (Lth,
Msb, K,) but the former is the more chaste, (Lth,
Msb,) A man's people, and tribe, (S, Msb, K,)
consisting of his nearer relations: (Msb:) [i. e.
his near kinsfolk:] and a number of men less
than ten, among whom is no woman; (AZ, S,
Msb, K;) as also نَفَرٌ: (AZ, Msb:) or from seven
to ten; (IDrd, Msb, K;) and sometimes a little
more; (IDrd;) less than seven, to three, being
called نَفَرٌ: (Msb:) or from three to ten: (K:)
or i. q. عَشِيرَةٌ: (ISk, Msb:) or more than ten, to
forty: (As, IF, Msb:) a pl., (S, Msb,) or a
word having a pl. meaning, (Th, Az, Msb,) without any proper sing.; (Th, Az, S, Msb, K;) like
نَفَرٌ and قَوْمٌ and مَعْشَرٌ and عَشِيرَةٌ; all applied to
men, exclusive of women: (Th, Msb:) and
↓ أُرْهُوطٌ signifies the same: (ISh, TA:) the pl.
of رهط is أَرْهُطٌ (Lth, S, K) and أَرْهِطَةٌ (Lth) and
أَرْهَاطٌ, (S, K,) [all pls. of pauc.,] the last of these
being pl. either of رَهَطٌ or of رَهْطٌ, (TA,) and
أَرَاهِطُ, (S, ISd, K,) as though pl. of أَرْهُطٌ, (S,
ISd,) though Sb makes it pl. of رَهْطٌ, because of
the rareness of the pl. pl., (ISd,) and أَرَاهِيطُ
[which is app. pl. of أَرْهَاطٌ]. (S, K.) You say,
هُمْ رَهْطُهُ دِنْيَةً They are his people, and his tribe,
closely related. (S, TA.) And it is said in the
Kur [xxvii. 49], وَكَانَ قِى المَدِينَةِ تِسْعَةُ رَهْطٍ, (S,)
but this means, [And there were in the city] nine
persons, (Bd,) or nine men. (Jel.) ―

say رَهْطٌ مِنْ عُشَرٍ [A collection of plants of the kind
called عشر]. (IAar, Sh, TA in art. ايك.)

by that name, is very neatly made, consisting of
a great number of slender thongs: it is worn
