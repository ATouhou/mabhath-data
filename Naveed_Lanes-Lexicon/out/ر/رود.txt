fro, during this day?]. (A, TA.) And رَادَتْ,

meaning] (tropical:)  he was, or became, restless, (S, A,) by
reason of disease or anxiety: (A:) [or he was, or
became, sleepless: for] a poet uses the phrase
رَاذَ وِسَادُهَا as expressive of an imprecation, mean
ing (assumed tropical:)  May she be sleepless, so that her pillow may
not remain still. (TA.) [And راد خُرْتُ القَوْمِ and
رادت أَخْرَاتُهُمْ: see خُرْتٌ.]
-A2-  راد, aor. يَرُودُ,

(TA;) He sought, sought after, or desired; or
he sought, or desired, to find and take, or to get;

(S, A, Mgh, L,) inf. n. رِيَادٌ and رَوْدٌ: (S, L;) and

He endeavoured to turn him, or convert him, to
El-Islám; occurring in a trad., in which the
agent of the verb is Mohammad, and the object is
his uncle Aboo-Tálib;. syn. رَاجَعَهُ and رَادَّهُ: (L:)
or رَاوَدْتُهُ عَلَى كَذَا, (S,) or عَلَى الأَمْرِ, (Msb,)
inf. n. مُرَاوَدَةٌ and رِوَادٌ, (S, Msb, K,) [primarily]
signifies I desired, (S, Msb, K, *) or sought, (Msb,)
of him that he should do such a thing, or the
thing; (S, * Msb;) المُرَاوَدَةُ implying contention
(المُخَاصَمَة), because he who desires, or seeks,
affects gentle, or bland, behaviour, like him who
deceives, or beguiles, and, like him, strives, or
labours, to attain his object: (Msb:) and [hence,]
راودهُ عَنِ الأَمْرِ, and عَلَيْهِ, He endeavoured to turn
him by blandishment, or by deceitful arts, or to
entice him to turn, from the thing, and to it;
syn. دَارَاهُ, (M, L,) or رَادَاهُ. (TT, as from the M.)
سَنُرَاوِدُ عَنْهُ أَبَاهُ, in the Kur xii. 61, means [We
will endeavour to turn his father from him, by
blandishment, or artifice, and to make him yield
him to us: or] we will strive, or labour, to obtain
him of his father. (Bd, Jel.) And رَاوَدَتْهُ عَنْ
نَفْسِهِ [in the Kur xii. 23] (assumed tropical:)  She desired, or sought,
of him, copulation, or his lying with her, using
blandishment, or artifice, for that purpose; she
tempted him to lie with her: (T, and Bd in
xii. 23:) [more literally, she endeavoured to turn
him, or entice him, by blandishment, or deceitful
arts, from his disdain, or disdainful incompliance,
and to make him yield himself to her:] and
رَاوَدَهَا عَنْ نَفْسِهَا (assumed tropical:)  he desired, or sought, of her,
copulation, &c. (T.) And رَاوَدَهُ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ (tropical:)  He
endeavoured to deceive him, or beguile him, and
to turn him [from his disdain, or purpose, or
will,] by blandishment, or artifice. (A.)
4
أَرْوَدَ, (S, A, K,) inf. n. إِرْوَادٌ and مُرْوَدٌ and
[quasi-inf. n.] ↓ مَرْوَدٌ (S, K) and ↓ رُوَيْدٌ (TA as
from the K [but omitted in my MS. copy of the
K and in the CK]) and ↓ رُوَيْدَآءُ and ↓ رُوَيْدِيَةٌ or
↓ رُوَيْدِيَّةٌ, (accord. to different copies of the K,)
He acted, or proceeded, gently, softly, or in a
leisurely manner, (S, A, K, TA,) in going, or
pace. (S, A, TA.)
-A2-  أَرْوَدَهُ, (S,) inf. n. إِرْوَادٌ, (M,)
He acted gently, softly, or in a leisurely manner,
towards, or with, him; or granted him a delay,
or respite; let him alone, or left him, for a while;
syn. أَمْهَلَهُ. (S, M. *) ―
-b2-  أَرَدْتُ الدَّوَابَّ: see 1, last
sentence.
-A3-  أَرَادَهُ, (M, L, Msb,) inf. n. إِرَادَةٌ, (S,
M, L, Msb, K,) originally with و, [i. e. أَرْوَدَهُ,]
because you say رَاوَدَهُ (S, L) in a similar sense,
(L,) He willed, wished, or desired, it: (S, * M, L,
K: *) he loved, or liked, it; and cared for, or
minded, it; or was rendered thoughtful, careful,
or anxious, by it: (M, L:) or he desired it;
sought it, or sought after it; (طَلَبَهُ;) and chose
it: (Msb:) [or] it differs from طَلَبَهُ, inasmuch
as إِرَادَةٌ is sometimes merely conceived in the
mind, not apparent; whereas طَلَبٌ is never other
wise than apparent, either by act or by word:
(Aboo-'Obeyd El-Bekree, TA:) Th says that it
sometimes denotes loving, or liking, and some
times it does not [as will be shown by what
follows]: and Lh mentions the saying هَرْدتُ
الشَّىْءَ, aor. أُهَرِيدُهُ, inf. n. هِرَادَةٌ, with ه substi
tuted for ء [as in هَرَقْتُ for أَرَقْتُ, &c.]. (M.)
You say, أَرَدْتُ مِنْهُ كَذَا [I desired, of him, such
a thing]. (A.) And مَا أَرَدْتُ إِلَّا مَا فَعَلْتَ [I
desired not aught save what thou didst, or hast
done]. (A.) [And اراد بِهِ كَذَا He desired to do
to him, or he intended him, such a thing;
whether good or evil: see Kur xxxiii. 17, &c.]
And Kutheiyir says,
أُرِيدُ لِأَنْسَى ذِكْرَهَا فَكَأَنَّمَا
تُمَثَّلُ لِى لَيْلَى بِكُلِّ سَبِيلِ
[I desire to forget the remembrance of her, or
the mention of her; but it seems as though Leylà
were imaged to me in every road]; meaning
أُرِيدُ أَنْ أَنْسَى. (M.) [And ISd says,] I think
that Sb has mentioned the phrase أَرَادَنِى بِهٰذَالِكَ,
i. e. He intended, or meant, me by that. (M.)
[اراد often signifies He intended, or meant, such
a thing by a saying or an action.] فَوَجَدَا فِيهَا
جِدَارًا يُرِيدُ أَنْ يَنْقَضَّ, in the Kur xviii. 78, means
(tropical:)  [And they found therein a wall] that was near,
or about, to fall down, (Bd, Jel,) or that was ready
to fall down; though الإِرَادَة is only from an
animate being, and not properly predicable of a
wall: and there are many similar instances; as
the saying of a poet,
يُرِيدُ الرُّمْحُ صَدْرَ أَبِى بَرَآءٍ
وَ يَعْدِلُ عَنْ رِمَآءِ بَنِى عُقَيْلِ
[The spear is ready to pierce the breast of Aboo
Barà, but it turns away from the bloods of the
sons of 'Okeyl]. (M.) [In like manner also] one
says, اراد البُكَآءَ (assumed tropical:)  [He was about, or ready, to
weep: a phrase of frequent occurrence; like
تَهَيَّأَ لِلْبُكَآءِ, and هَمَّ بِالْبُكَآءِ]. (TA in art. جهش, &c.)
―
-b2-  You say also, ارادهُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ, (M,) or على
الأَمْرِ, (A, Mgh,) He endeavoured to induce him,
(M,) or he incited him, or made him, (A, Mgh,)
to do the thing. (M, A, Mgh.) And ارادهُ عَلَى
أَنْ يَكْتُبَ He incited him, or made him, to write.
(Mgh.) And ارادهُ إِلَى الكَلَامِ He constrained, or
necessitated, him to speak. (M, * TA.)
5
تروّد He trembled, or quaked, by reason of
extreme softness, or tenderness, and fatness. (KL.)

إِرْتَوَدَ see 1, in four places.
10
إِسْتَرْوَدَ see 1, in five places. ―
-b2-  استراد لِأَمْرِ اللّٰهِ
occurs in a trad. as meaning He returned, and
became gentle and submissive to the command of
God. (TA.)
رَادٌ: see رَائِدٌ, with which it is syn. (S, M, K.)
رَادَةٌ [is its fem.: and] is a pl. of رَائِدٌ. (L.) ―
-b2-
اِمْرَأَةٌ رَادَةٌ A woman who goes about to and from
the tents, or houses, of her female neighbours;
(AZ, As, S, M, A, K;) as also رَادٌ (TA) and
↓ رَوَادٌ (S M) and ↓ رَؤُودٌ (Aboo-' Alee, M) and
↓ رُوَادَةٌ, like ثُمَامَة, and ↓ رَائِدَةٌ. (K.) You say
اِمْرَأْةٌ رَأْدَةٌ غَيْرُ رَادَةٍ A soft, or tender, woman; not
one that roves about: in which the former رادة
may be without ء, and the latter must be so.
(A and TA in art. رأد.) [See رُؤْدٌ; where it is
stated that رَادٌ and رَادَةٌ and ↓ رُودَةٌ, as epithets
applied to a girl or woman, are syn., one with
another, meaning Soft, or tender, &c., like رَأْدٌ
and رَأْدَةٌ and رُؤْدَةٌ.] ―
-b3-  رِيحٌ رَادَةٌ A wind blowing
violently to and fro: (TA:) [and ↓ رِيحٌ رَائِدَةٌ
signifies the same; or wind in motion, or in a
state of commotion.; or veering about: see 1.]
[And] A wind blowing gently; (A;) and so ↓ رَوْدٌ
and ↓ رَائِدَةٌ (K) and ↓ رَوَادٌ. (TA. [See also art.
ريد.])
رَوْدٌ: see what next precedes.
رُودٌ Gentleness; or a leisurely manner of acting
or proceeding. (S, M, A, K.) [And accord. to
the TT, as from the M, so رُؤْدٌ; but this is a mistranscription, for رُؤْدٌ: see this last, in art. رأد.]
You say, يَمْشِى عَلَى رُودٍ He walks, or goes,
gently, softly, or in a leisurely manner. (S, A,
K.) And its dim. is ↓ رُوَيْدٌ. (S, A, K. [But see
what follows.]) They said ↓ رُوَيْدًا, meaning
Gently, softly, or in a leisurely manner; (T, S,
M, A, K;) with tenween: (T:) and ↓ اِمْشِ رُوَيْدًا
Walk thou, or go thou, gently, &c.: (T, A:) so
accord. to the lexicologists [in general]: but
accord. to Sb, it is a verbal n.: [for] they said,
زَيْدًا ↓ رُوَيْدَ, meaning Act thou gently, softly, or
in a leisurely manner, towards, or with, Zeyd;
or grant him a delay, or respite; let him alone,
or leave him, for a while; syn. أَمْهِلْهُ: hence it
has no dual nor pl. nor fem. form: and hence
they say that it is for إِرْوَادًا, in the sense of أَرْوِدْ;
as though it were an abbreviated dim., formed by
the rejection of the augmentative letters: this is
the opinion of Sb; for he holds it to be a substitute for أَرْوِدْ; though it has a nearer resemblance to إِرْوَادٌ because it is a noun: others hold
it to be the dim. of رُودٌ, and cite the saying [of a
poet],
كَأَنَّهُ مِثْلُ مَنْ يَمْشِى عَلَى رُودِ
[As though he were like him who walks, or goes,
gently, &c.]: but this is a mistake; for رُودٌ is not
put in the place of a verb, as إِرْوَادٌ is. (M.)
Accord. to Ibn-Keysán, ↓ رُوَيْد seems to have
two contr. significations; for they said, رُوَيْدَ زَيْدًا,
meaning Leave thou Zeyd, or let him alone; and
also meaning act thou gently towards, or with,
Zeyd, and retain him, or withhold him. (TA.)
One says also, عَمْرًا ↓ رُوَيْدَكَ, meaning Act thou
gently, &c., towards, or with, 'Amr; syn. أَمْهِلْهُ:
(T, * S, M, * K:) the ك in this case being a denotative of allocution, (T, S, M,) and having no
place in the desinential syntax: (S, M: *) it is
added only when رويد is used in the sense of an
imperative; (T, S, K;) and to prevent confusion
of him who is meant to be addressed with him
who is not meant, because رويد applies to one
and to more than one and to the male and to the
female; though sometimes one says رويدك to a
person when one does not fear his being confounded with another, using the ك as a corroborative. (T.) In this case, ↓ رويد is an abbreviated dim. of إِرْوَاد, the inf. n. of أَرْوَدَ. (S.) In
like manner also one says, (K, TA,) to a male,
(TA,) ↓ رُوَيْدَكَنِى [Act thou gently, &c., towards,
or with, me]; and to a female, ↓ رُوَيْدَكِنِى; and
↓ رُوَيْدَكُمَانِى (K, TA) to two persons; (TA;)
and ↓ رُوَيْدَكُمُونِى (K, TA) to males more than
two; (TA;) and ↓ رُوَيْدَكُنَّنِى (K, TA) to females more than two. (TA.) ↓ رُوَيْد is used in
four different manners: first, as a verbal n.; as
in عَمْرًا ↓ رُوَيْدَ, (S, K, *) i. e. أَرْوِدْ عَمْرًا, (S,) meaning أَمْهِلْهُ [expl. above]: (S, K:) secondly, as an
inf. n.; as in عَمْرٍو ↓ رُوَيْدَ [virtually meaning the
same]; the former word being prefixed to the
latter, governing it in the gen. case; (S, M, * K; *)
like فَضَرْبَ الرِّقَابِ, in the Kur [xlvii. 4], (S, M, *) in
which the inf. n. is put for its verb; (Jel;) and
like عَذِيرَ الحَىِّ [expl. in art. عذر]: (M:) thirdly,
as an epithet; as in ↓ سَارُوا سَيْرًا رُوَيْدًا [They went,
or journeyed, at a gentle, or leisurely, rate of
going, or journeying]; (Sb, S, K;) and سَارُوا
↓ رُوَيْدًا, in which سَيْرًا is suppressed: (T:) fourthly,
as a denotative of state; as in ↓ سَارَ القَوْمُ رُوَيْدًا
[The people, or party, went, or journeyed, going,
or journeying, gently, or leisurely]; it being here
in connection with a determinate noun, and therefore a denotative of its state. (S, K.) When it is
used as a threat, it is with nasb, without tenween;
(Lth, T, M; *) as in the saying of a poet,
تَصَاهَلْ بِالْعِرَاقِ جِيَادُنَا ↓ رُوَيْدَ
كَأَنَّكَ بِالضَّحَّاكِ قَدْ قَامَ نَادِبُهْ
[Act thou, or proceed thou, gently, lest our coursers
neigh, one to another, in El-'Irák: it is as
though thou wert with Ed-Dahhák, his summoner to battle having already risen]. (Lth, T.)
Sb mentions his having heard the saying, وَاللّٰهِ
مَا الشِّعْرَ ↓ لَوْ أَرَدْتَ الدَّرَاهِمَ لَأَعْطَيْتُكَ رُوَيْدَ [By
God, hadst thou desired the money, I had given
thee: let alone the poetry: ما being here redundant]:
(T, M:) like the phrase, فَدَعِ الشِّعْرَ: (M:) and
similar to this is the saying, الشِّعْرَ يَغِبَّ ↓ رُوَيْدَ
[explained in art. غب]. (T.)
رِيدٌ [originally رِوْدٌ] Will, wish, or desire; (K;)
and so ↓ رِيدَةٌ [originally رِوْدَةٌ]: (M, L:) or the
former signifies a thing that one wishes, or desires,
and strives to obtain: (T in art. ريد:) and the
latter, love, or liking, for a thing; and solicitude
respecting it: (M, L:) or the latter signifies a
kind, or manner, of wishing or desiring; as in the
saying, أَرَدْتُهُ بِكُلِّ رِيدَةِ [I wished it, or desired it,
with every kind, or manner, of wishing or desiring]. (M.)
رُودَةٌ: see رَادٌ.
رِيدَةٌ: see رِيدٌ.
رَوَادٌ: see رَادٌ, in two places.
الرِّيَادُ, originally an inf. n., and ذَبُّ الرِّيَادِ, The
wild bull; [a species of bovine antelope;] (M;)
called ذبّ الرياد because he goes to and fro, not
remaining in one place; (M in art. ذب;) or
because he pastures going to and fro; (T and S *
and M in that art.;) or because his females
pasture with him, going to and fro. (T in that
art.) Also, the latter, (tropical:)  A man who comes and
goes. (Kr, M and TA in art. ذب.) And (tropical:)  A man
who is in the habit of visiting women. (AA, T
and K in that art.)
رَؤُودٌ: see رَادٌ.
الرِّوَنْدُ الصِّينِىُّ, (K,) or الرِّيوَنْدُ الصِّينِىُّ, (L,)
[mentioned in this art. though the ن should be
regarded as radical, for] it is not genuine Arabic,
(L,) [China-rhubarb;] a well-known medicine;
(K;) a certain cool medicine, good for the liver:
(L:) the physicians add an ا to it, (K,) saying
رَاوَنْد: (TA:) there are four kinds thereof; the
best of which is the صِينِىّ; and inferior to this is
the خُرَاسَانِىّ, which is [commonly] known by the
appellation of رَاوَنْدُ الدَّوَابِّ, used by the veterinarians: it is a black [app. a mistake for red, or
yellow,] wood, of compound powers, but its predominant qualities are heat and dryness. (TA.)

throughout.

Beasts pasturing at pleasure: (T:) or going to
and for [in the place of pasture]: or pasturing
together while the rest are debarred from the

pillow moves to and fro; meaning] (tropical:)  a man restless by reason of disease or anxiety; (A;) or
uneasy on his pillow by reason of anxiety that
disquiets him: (TA:) [or sleepless: see 1.] And

the like, that has fallen into it, or the foul, thick,
white matter that collects in its inner corner,

(L;) or one who looks for, and seeks, herbage,
and a place in which to alight, and chooses the
best thereof; (T;) and ↓ رَادٌ signifies the same;
(S, M, K;) the latter occurring in the poetry of
Hudheyl; (M;) [originally رَوَدٌ,] of the measure
فَعَلٌ in the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ, (S, K,)
like فَرَطٌ in the sense of فَارِطٌ, (S,) or of the measure فَاعِلٌ deprived of its medial radical letter, or
of the measure فَعِلٌ, [originally رَوِدٌ,] but if so, it
is a kind of rel. n., not an act. part. n.: (M:) the
pl. of the former is رُوَّادٌ (M, A, L) and رَادَةٌ. (L.)
One says, الرَّائِدُ لَا يَكْذِبُ أَهْلَهُ, (T, Mgh,) or
لَا يَكْذِبُ الرَّائِدُ أَهْلَهُ, (S,) [The seeker of herbage,
&c., will not lie to his family,] for if he lie to
them he perishes with them: (Ham p. 547:) a
prov. applied to him who will not lie when he
relates a thing. (M.) And hence the saying,
الحُمَّى رَائِدُ المَوْتِ (tropical:)  Fever is the messenger that
precedes death; like the messenger that goes
before a people, or party, to seek for herbage and
water. (Mgh, TA.) Hence, likewise, رَائِدٌ is also
applied to (tropical:)  One who goes before with some abominable deed or design. (TA.) And to (assumed tropical:)  A seeker
