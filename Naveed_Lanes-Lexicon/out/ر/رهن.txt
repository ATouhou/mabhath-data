رهن1
رَهَنَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
رَهَنَ, (Msb,)
inf. n. رَهْنٌ, (S, TA,) or رُهُونٌ, (Msb,) It (a thing,
S, Msb, TA) continued, subsisted, lasted, endured,
remained, or remained fixed or stationary; it was,
or became, permanent, constant, firm, steady, stead
fast, stable, fixed, fast, settled, or established. (S,
Mgh, Msb, K, TA.) This is the primary signification.
(Mgh, TA. *) ―
-b2-  Hence, (Mgh,) رَهَنَ بِالمَكَانِ
(tropical:)  He remained, stayed, dwelt, or abode, in the place.
(A, Mgh, TA.) ―
-b3-  And رَهَنَ, (JK, S, K,) aor.
رَهَنَ,
(K, TA,) or
رَهُنَ, (JK, [but this I think to be a mis
take,]) inf. n. رُهُونٌ, (K,) said of a man, and of a
camel, (JK, S, * TA,) and of any beast (TA,) He was,
or became, lean, or emaciated; (JK, S, K, TA;) and
fatigued, tired, weary, or jaded. (JK, TA.) You say,
رَكِبَ حَتَّى رَهَنَ He rode until he became lean, or
emaciated. (ISh, TA. [See رَاهِنٌ.])
-A2-  As trans.,
see 4, first signification. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] as a law
term, رَهْنٌ signifies The putting, or placing, an
article of real property [to remain] as a pledge,
or security, or making it to be such, for a debt
that is obligatory or that will become obligatory.
(TA.) You say, رَهَنَهُ الشَّىْءَ, and رَهَنَهُ عِنْدَهُ, (S,
Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
رَهَنَ, (K,) inf. n. رَهْنٌ (Msb,
TA) [and رَهِينَةٌ, q. v. voce رَهْنٌ]; and ↓ ارهنهُ
الشَّىْءَ; (S, K;) all signify the same; (S;) i. e.
He deposited the thing with him (Msb, K) [as a
pledge] to be in lieu of that which he had taken,
or received, from him: (K:) [i. e. he pledged the
thing to him, or with him:] and رَهَنْتُ المَتَاعَ
بِالدَّيْنِ, inf. n. رَهْنٌ, I restricted the commodity
or placed it in custody, for, or by reason of, the
debt; and بالدين ↓ ارهنتهُ is a dial. var. thereof,
but of rare occurrence, and disallowed by those
who are held in esteem: (Msb:) for, properly,
they say, (Msb,) زَيْدًا الثَّوْبَ ↓ أَرْهَنْتُ signifies I
gave to Zeyd the garment, or piece of cloth, in
order that he should deposit it as a pledge (Msb,
K *) with some one. (Msb.) 'Abd-Allah Ibn
Hemmám Es-Saloolee says, (S,) or Hemmám
Ibn-Murrah, (TA,)
مَالِكَا ↓ نَجَوْتُ وَ أَرْهَنْتُهُمْ  فَلَمَّا خَشِيتُ أَظَافِيرَهُمْ
[And when I dreaded their nails, I escaped, and
gave them, or left with them, as a pledge, Málik]:
thus, says Th, all relate the verse, except As, who
says وَ أَرْهَنُهُمْ مالكا [i. e. leaving with them, as a
pledge, Málik]: he likens this phrase to the say
ing قُمْتُ وَ أَصُكُّ وَجْهَهُ; and this is a good way of
explaining it; for the و is that which is a deno
tative of state; the meaning being صَاكًّا وَجْهَهُ:
[accord. to the former reading, in the opinion of
Th,] the poet means I left Málik remaining with
them; not as a pledge; because [when the leaving
a thing as a pledge is meant, in his opinion,] one
does not say, الشَّىْءَ ↓ أَرْهَنْتُ, but only رَهَنْتُهُ. (S,
TA.) [See, however, 4.] You say also, رَهَنَهُ عَنْهُ,
inf. n. رَهْنٌ, meaning He made him, or it, to be a
pledge in lieu of him, or it: a poet, asserted by
IJ to be a pagan, says,
اِرْهَنْ بَنِيكَ عَنْهُمُ أَرْهَنْ بَنِىْ
[Make thou thy sons to be pledges in lieu of them:
in that case I will make my sons to be pledges:
بَنِى being for بَنِىَّ]. (TA.) And رَهَنْتُهُ لِسَانِى (assumed tropical:)  [I
made my tongue to be as though it were a pledge
to him, to be restrained, or to be used, for his
sake or benefit]: in this case one should not say
↓ أَرْهَنْتُهُ; (IAar, K;) though one says thus of a
garment, or piece of cloth, [&c.,] as well as رَهَنْتُهُ.
(TA.)
3
رَاهُنْتُ فُلَانًا عَلَى كَذَا, (S, Msb,) inf. n.
مُرَاهَنَةٌ, (S,) or رِهَانٌ, (Msb,) or both, (K, and so
in a copy of the S,) I laid a bet, or wager, or
stake, with such a one, for such a thing, (S,
Msb, K, *) mostly (TA) said in relation to horses
running a race, (JK, TA, *) to be taken by him
who should outstrip, or overcome. (Msb.) ―
-b2-
The inf. ns. also signify (tropical:)  The contending [of two
persons] to outstrip [in a race] upon horses, (K,
TA,) and otherwise. (TA.) Hence the prov.,
هُمَا كَفَرَسَىْ رِهَانٍ [explained in art. فرس]. (JK.)
4
ارهن He made (a thing, Msb,) to continue,
subsist, last, endure, remain, or remain fixed or
stationary; to be, or become, permanent, can
stant, firm, steady, steadfast, stable, fixed, fast,
settled, or established; (S, * Mgh, * Msb, K; *) and
so ↓ رَهَنَ; (K;) but the former is the more ap
proved: (TA:) and also he found it to be so.
(Msb.) You say, ارهن لَهُمُ الطَّعَامَ, (T, S, K, TA,)
and الشَّرَابَ, (T, S, TA,) and المَالَ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He
continued, or made permanent, to them the food,
(T, S, K, TA,) and the beverage, (T, S, TA,) and
the property. (TA.) [And accord. to an expla
nation of أُرْهِنَتْ (referring to dates), by 'Alee Ibn
Hamzeh, cited in a marginal note in a copy of
the S, in art. أَرْهَنَ, وهب signifies He prepared
food, and continued it, or made it permanent.]
―
-b2-  [Hence ارهنهُ as used by some in another sense
of رَهَنَهُ:] see 1, in six places. [That it is allowable
to use it thus may be inferred from phrases here
following.] ―
-b3-  You say, أَرْهَنْتُ مَالِى I staked my
property. (JK.) And أَرْهَنُوا بَيْنَهُمْ خَطَرًا They
gave, of their own free will, what the party
approved, whatever were its amount, to be to
them a stake at a race. (TA.) And أَرْهَنْتُ بِهِ
وَلَدِى (S, K, *) inf. n. إِرْهَانٌ, (S,) (assumed tropical:)  I made my
children to be as a stake for him, or it. (S, K. *)
And ارهنهُ لِلْمَوْتِ (assumed tropical:)  He resigned him to death.
(IAar, TA.) And ارهن المَيِّتَ القَبْرَ (tropical:)  He deposited
the dead body in the grave [as a pledge to be
rendered up on the day of resurrection]. (K, TA.)
―
-b4-  Accord. to AZ, (S, TA, in one copy of the S
it is A'Obeyd,) أَرْهَنْتُ فِى السِّلْعَةِ signifies I
bought the commodity for a dear, or an excessive,
price; (S, K, TA;) gave largely for it until I
obtained it: (TA:) accord. to ISk, I paid in
advance for the commodity; syn. أَسْلَفْتُ; (S,
TA;) and in the T it is said, [and in like manner
in the JK,] that ارهن فِى كَذَا وَ كَذَا signifies
اسلف فِيهِ: (TA:) [in the K it is said that أَرْهَنَهُ
signifies أَسْلَفَهُ, as though it meant he lent him a
sum of money &c.:] accord. to Er-Rághib, the
proper meaning [of إِرْهَانٌ] is one's giving a com
modity before [the full payment of] the price,
and so making it to be pledged for the completion
of its price. (TA.)
-A2-  ارهنهُ also signifies He, or
it, weakened him: (K:) [like أَوْهَنَهُ:] and rendered
him lean, or emaciated. (TA.) And ارهن اللّٰهُ
قُوَّتَهُ God weakened him; syn. أَوْهَنَهُ. (JK.)
6
تراهنا They two laid bets, wagers, or stakes,
each with the other; syn. تَوَاضَعَا الرُّهُونَ. (TA.)
And تراهن القَوْمُ The party contended together,
every one of them laying a bet, wager, or stake,
in order that the person outstripping should take
the whole when he overcame. (Msb.)
8
ارتهن مِنْهُ He took, or received, from him a
pledge. (K.) [Or] ارتهنهُ He took, or received, it
as a pledge: (JK, Mgh:) or ارتهنهُ مِنْهُ he took,
or received, it from him; namely, a pledge.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  [Accord. to Freytag, ارتهنهُ بِهِ signifies
He had him, or held him, as a pledge to him for
it. And اُرْتُهِنَ He, or it, was given as a pledge.
But for neither of these has he mentioned any
authority.]
10
إِسْتَرْهَنَ [استرهنهُ He asked him, or desired him, to
pledge a thing with him: and, to give a pledge.]
You say, اِسْتَرْهَنَنِى كَذَا فَرَهَنْتُهُ عِنْدَهُ [He asked
me, or desired me, to pledge such a thing, or to
deposit such a thing as a pledge, and I pledged it
with him, or deposited it with him as a pledge].
(Mgh.)
رَهْنٌ, originally an inf. n., (Msb,) is syn. with
↓ مَرْهُونٌ; (Mgh, Msb;) i. e. (Msb) it signifies
[A pledge;] a thing deposited with a person
(Msb, * K) to be in lieu of a thing that has been
taken, or received, from him; (K;) or a thing
that is deposited as a security for a debt: and
↓ رِهَانٌ has a similar meaning, but is specially
applied to a thing that is deposited as a bet, or
wager, or stake; and is likewise originally an
inf. n.: (Er-Rághib, TA:) ↓ رَهِينَةٌ, also, is syn.
with رَهْنٌ [as meaning the act of giving as a
pledge], like as شَتِيمَةٌ is syn. with شَتْمٌ; the ة
being added to give intensiveness to the significa
tion: then, like رَهْنٌ, it is used as syn. with مَرْهُونٌ
[in the sense explained above, as will be seen in
what follows in this paragraph]; (IAth, TA;)
[i. e.] رَهِينَةٌ is an inf. n. like شَتِيمَةٌ, applied to
denote the pass. part. n. [used as a subst. pro
perly so termed] like رَهْنٌ, not as an epithet;
(Bd in lxxiv. 41;) [or, in other words,] رَهِينَةٌ
signifies anything by reason of which a thing
[such as a debt or the like] is restricted, or appro
priated, to oneself; as also ↓ مُرْتَهَنَةٌ: (K: [I here
follow two copies of the K, in which it is said,
كُلُّ مَا احْتُبِسَ بِهِ شَىْءٌ فَرَهِينَةٌ وَ مُرْتَهَنَةٌ: in the CK,
and in the copy of the K followed in the TA,
فَرَهِينُهُ وَ مُرْتَهَنُهُ, which perverts the meaning, though
↓ رَهِينٌ and ↓ مُرْتَهَنٌ may be used in the same sense
as رَهِينَةٌ and مُزْتَهَنَةٌ, as will be seen in the course
of this paragraph: and in the TA, in the place of
احْتُبِسَ, is put يحبس, meaning يُحْبَسُ: there is,
however, this difference between ↓ رَهِينَةٌ and
↓ مُرْتَهَنَةٌ; that the former properly signifies a thing
deposited as a pledge; and the latter, a thing
taken, or received, as a pledge:]) the pl. of رَهْنٌ
is رِهَانٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and رُهُونٌ (Mgh, Msb,
K) and رُهُنٌ, (Mgh, K,) this last said to be a pl.
of رَهْنٌ by Aboo-' Amr Ibn-El-' Alà, but disap
proved by Akh, because a word of the measure
فَعْلٌ has not a pl. of the measure فُعُلٌ except in
rare and anomalous instances, though he says that
it may be [as it is said to be in the Msb] pl. of
رِهَانٌ, which is pl. of رَهْنٌ, (S,) and Fr says that
رُهُنٌ is pl. of رِهَانٌ, but this is denied in the M,
because any pl. may not be pluralized except
when there is express authority for it and when
the case does not admit of any other decision;
(TA;) and رُهْنٌ, also, is another pl. of رَهْنٌ, (TA,)
[or rather it is a contraction of رُهُنٌ;] and
another pl. of رَهْنٌ [or rather a quasi-pl. n.] is
↓ رَهِينٌ, (IJ, K,) like as عَبِيدٌ is of عَبْدٌ: (TA:)
the pl. of ↓ رَهِينَةٌ is رَهَائِنُ. (S, K.) غَلِقَ الرَّهْنُ
بِمَا فِيهِ. [The pledge became, or has become, per
manent as a possession, with what was, or is,
comprised in it,] is a prov., applied to him who
has fallen into a case from which he cannot hope
to escape: it is said in a trad., لَا يَغْلَقُِ الرَّهْنُ,
(Meyd,) [i. e. The pledge shall not remain, or let
not the pledge remain, in the hand of its receiver
when its depositer is able to release it; for] لا
is here either negative or prohibitive: you say,
غَلِقَ الرَّهْنُ, aor. يَغْلَقُ, inf. n. غُلُوقٌ [or غَلَقٌ],
meaning The pledge remained in the hand of the
receiver when the depositor was able to release it:
(Nh, cited in a copy of the “ Jámi' es-Sagheer: ”)
the trad. means that the receiver of the pledge
shall not have a right to it when the depositer has
not released it within a certain time: for it was a
custom in the Time of Ignorance for the receiver
to keep possession of the pledge in this case;
but El-Islám abolished it. (Meyd, * Nh.) You
say also, هُوَ رَهْنٌ بِكَذَا and بكذا ↓ رَهِينَةٌ He, or it,
is [a person, or thing,] pledged for such a thing:
(IAth, TA:) or taken [as a pledge] for such a
thing; as also ↓ رَهِينٌ and ↓ مُرْتَهَنٌ. (TA.) And
أَنَا رَهْنٌ بِكَذَا and ↓ رَهِينٌ and ↓ رَهِينَةٌ I am taken
[as a pledge] for such a thing. (Mgh.) And
[hence,] أَنَا لَكَ رَهْنٌ بِكَذَا (JK, TA) and ↓ رَهِينَةٌ
(TA) I am responsible, or a surety, to thee for
such a thing. (JK, TA.) And بِقَيْدِهِ ↓ رِجْلُهُ رَهِينَةٌ
[His leg, or foot, is a pledge for the safe-keeping
of his shackle: for if the meaning were مَرْهُونَةٌ it
would be رَهِينٌ, without ة]. (TA.) And الخَلْقُ
المَوْتِ ↓ رَهَائِنُ [Mankind, or all created beings,
are the pledges of death]. (TA.) And هُوَ رَهْنُ
يَدِ المَنِيَّةِ [He is the pledge of the hand of death,
or of fate, or destiny]; said of one when he has
sought, or courted, death. (TA.) And يَدِى لَكَ
رَهْنٌ [My hand is a pledge to thee]; by which is
meant responsibility, or suretiship. (TA.) And
قَبْرٍ ↓ إِنَّهُ لَرَهِينُ [Verily he is the pledge of a
grave, which will render him up on the day of
resurrection]. (TA.) It is said in the Kur
lxxiv. 41, ↓ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ, meaning
[Every soul is a thing] pledged with God [for what
it shall have wrought; its works being regarded as
a debt, for which it will be either released or held in
custody to be punished everlastingly]: رهينة being
an inf. n. like شَتِيمَةٌ applied to denote the pass.
part. n. [in a manner before mentioned] like رَهْنٌ;
for if it were an epithet [i. e. used in the proper
sense of a pass. part. n.] the word would be
رَهِينٌ. (Bd.) And in lii. 21 of the same, كُلُّ
↓ امْرِئٍ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهِينٌ, i. e. [Every man is]
pledged (مَرْهُونٌ, Bd, Jel) with God (عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ)
for what he shall have wrought; so that if he
have done good, He will release him; but other
wise, He will destroy [or hold in confinement
and punish] him; (Bd;) or to be punished for
evil, and recompensed for good. (Jel.) And it
is said in a trad., بِعَقِيقَتِهِ ↓ كُلُّ غُلَامٍ رَهِينَةٌ [Every
boy that is born is a pledge for his عقيقة, i. e.
for the victim that is to be sacrificed for him when
his head is shaven the first time; which is com
monly regarded as his ransom from the fire of
Hell]: i. e., the عقيقة is absolutely necessary for
him; wherefore he is likened, when not released
from it, to a pledge in the hand of the receiver:
El-Khattábee says that the best explanation of it
is that of Ahmad Ibn-Hambal; that if the عقيقة
be not sacrificed for the boy and he die an infant,
he will not intercede for his parents. (TA.) ―

ing, in a place. (JK.) ―

مَرْهُونٌ [Pledged; deposited as a pledge; or]
restricted, or placed in custody, for, or by reason
of, a debt; (S, * Msb;) originally مَرْهُونٌ بِالدَّيْنِ
[or بِدَيْنٍ]; (Msb;) and ↓ رَهِينٌ signifies the same;
(S, Msb;) and the fem. of this [or rather the
subst. formed from it, for when it is used as a
fem. epithet, having the sense of a pass. part. n.,
it is without ة, as remarked above, voce رَهْنٌ,] is
