ركع1
رَكَعَ, (Th, S, &c.,) aor.
رَكَعَ, (Th, TA,) inf. n.
رُكُوعٌ (Th, S, Mgh, Msb, K) and رَكْعٌ, (Th,
TA,) He bowed, or bent, himself; or became
bowed or bent: (Th, S, Mgh, Msb:) so says Er-Rághib, adding that it is sometimes used to
denote a particular manner of doing so in prayer,
and sometimes to denote humility and self-abasement either in worship or in other cases: (TA:)
he lowered his head: (Th:) and he (an old man)
bowed himself, or bent himself, or became bowed
or bent, by reason of age: (S, Msb, K:) this is
[said to be] the primary signification: (TA:) or
he fell upon his face; (IDrd, IB, K;) and
stumbled. (IB.) ―
-b2-  And hence, from رَكَعَ as
used in the first of the senses explained above,
(S, Mgh,) or as used in the first of the senses
assigned to it above when said of an old man,
(TA,) or as used in the last sense explained above,
(IB,) رُكُوعُ الصَّلَاةِ, (S, IB, Mgh, TA,) or الرُّكُوعُ
فِى الصَّلَاة, The lowering of the head, (K, TA,)
by a person praying, (TA,) [or in prayer,] after
the act of standing in which the recitation [of
portions of the Kur-án] is performed, so that the
palms of the hands reach the knees; or, so that
the back becomes depressed; (K, TA;) accord. to
the doctors of practical law, so that if a cup full of
water be placed upon the back, it will not be spilled.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  رَكَعَ إِلَى اللّٰهِ He lowered his head, or
he humbled himself, to God; syn. اِطْمَأَنَّ. (Z,
TA.) ―
-b4-  رَكَعَ, also signifies He prayed; (Mgh;)
and so ↓ تركّع. (TA.) Thus in the Kur [ii. 40],
وَارْكَعُوا مَعَ الرَّاكِعِينَ, And pray ye with those
who pray. (Mgh.) You say also, رَكَعَ رَكْعَةً,
and رَكْعَتَيْنِ, and ثَلَاثَ رَكَعَاتٍ, He prayed a
rek'ah, and two rek'ahs, and three rek'ahs. (K.)
[See رَكْعَةٌ, below.] ―
-b5-  Also, accord. to IKoot and
several others, He stood to prayer. (Msb) ―
-b6-

(TA.) ―
-b7-  رَكَعَتِ النَّخْلَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The palm-tree inclined:
a phrase which may be of classical authority, but
[Mtr says,] I have not found it. (Mgh.) ―
-b8-  Said of
a man, (TA,) رَكَعَ, also signifies (tropical:)  He became poor
after richness, or competence, or sufficiency; and
his state, or condition, became lowered, or abased.

رَكْعَةٌ, [inf. n. of un. of 1: and particularly signifying] A single act of standing in prayer: and in
its legal acceptation, used in a more particular
sense; (Msb;) meaning a single act of standing
in prayer, followed by the رُكُوع [or lowering of
the head in the manner described above (see
الرُّكُوعُ فِى الصَّلَاةِ in the first paragraph)] and
two prostrations: (TA:) [and hence, by a further
extension of the meaning, for صَلَاةُ رَكْعَةٍ, the
prayer of one bowing of the head and body; the
previous act of standing, and the two subsequent
prostrations, being understood as included in this

performed the prayers of two bowings of the head
and body]. (Msb, K.) [A full description of the
act of prayer thus termed may be seen in my work
on the Modern Egyptians.]
