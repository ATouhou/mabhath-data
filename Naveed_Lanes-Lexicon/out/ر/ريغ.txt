mouthful, was [smeared, seasoned,] imbued, or
soaked, (تَرَوَّت,) with clarified butter. (En-Nadr,

رِيغٌ: see what next follows.
رِيَاغٌ, as in the [T and] O and Tekmileh and L; in
the K, erroneously, ↓ رِيغٌ; (TA;) Dust, or dust
raised: (Sh, K:) or, as some say, (TA,) dust, or
earth, (K, TA,) in a general sense: or such as is
comminuted. (TA.) Ru-beh says, describing an
ass [i. e. a wild ass] and his females,
وَإِنْ أَثَارَتْ مِنْ رِيَاغٍ سَمْلَقَا
تَهْوِى حَوَامِيهَا بِهِ مُدَقَّقَا
using an inversion, for he means أَثَارَتْ رِيَاغًا مِنْ
سَمْلَقٍ [i. e. And if they raise earth from a level
plain, the sides of their hoofs make it to fall down
reduced to powder]. (TA.)
-A2-  And i. q. نِفَارٌ
[The act of fleeing, going away or aside or apart
or to a distance, retiring to a distance, shrinking,
&c.; inf. n. of نَفَرَ, q. v.]: (K:) so some say.
(TA.)
-A3-  Sgh says that this word may belong to
the present art. and to art. روغ, q. v. (TA.)
مَرَاغٌ, signifying The place in which beasts roll,
or turn themselves over, is thought by Az to be so
called from رِيَاغٌ in the first of the senses assigned
to it above. (TA.)
مُرَيَّغٌ A thing defiled with dust or earth, or
much sprinkled with dust. (El-'Azeezee, K.)
