شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and رَمَضَانُ,
alone, for the latter, though disapproved by some
of the learned, occurs in a trad., (Mgh, Msb,
TA,) and in poetry, (TA,) but not الرَّمَضَانُ, for
this is incorrect, (Mgh,) The ninth of the Arabian
months: (TA:) so called because, when they
changed the names of the months from the ancient
language, they named them according to the
seasons in which they fell, (Jm, S, K,) and this
month, (Jm, S,) or نَاتِقٌ, (K,) for this was its
ancient name, (TA,) agreed with the days of
vehement heat: (Jm, S, Mgh, Msb, K:) [see
زَمَنٌ:] or from رَمِضٌ said of a man fasting, expl.
above: (Fr, K:) or because [its effect is as though]
it burned [and annulled] sins; (K;) from رَمَضَهُ
الحَرُّ, expl. above; but [SM says,] I know not
how that is; for I have not seen any one [except
F] mention it: (TA:) the pl. is رَمَضَانَاتٌ (S,
Msb, K) and أَرْمِضَآءُ (S, Msb) and أَرْمِضَةٌ (L, K)
and رَمَضَانُونَ (K) and رَمَاضِينُ, (Yoo, Sgh, L,
Msb,) like شَعَابِينُ, (Msb,) and أَرْمُضٌ, which is
anomalous, (IDrd, K,) is asserted by some of the
lexicologists to be another pl., but this is not well
established nor received. (IDrd.) ―
-b2-  It is said in
a trad. that رَمَضَانُ is One of the names of God;
but this trad. is pronounced by El-Beyhakee to
be of weak authority; and that it is so is evident;
as no learned man has transmitted this word as
such; (Msb;) [except Mujáhid; for] it is related
that Mujáhid disapproved of forming a pl. from
it, saying, It has been told me that it is one of
the names of God: (TA:) if it be so, it is not
derived (K, TA) from what has been here mentioned; (TA;) or it refers to the meaning of
(assumed tropical:)  The Forgiving; or He who obliterates sins. (K.)
رَمِيضٌ: see مَرْمُوضٌ.
-A2-  Also Made thin by
being beaten between two stones: (A:) sharpened:
(S, K:) sharp: (K, TA:) applied to a knife;
(Sh;) and to such as is termed شَفْرَة; (S, K;)

(مُوسَى), as also رَمِيضَةٌ; (A, TA;) and in the
last of the above-mentioned senses, to anything:
(S:) it is of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the
measure مَفْعُولٌ: (TA:) or it may be in the sense
of the measure فَاعِلٌ, from رَمُضَ, though this verb
may not have been heard. (Sgh, TA.)

dressed in the manner described above in the explanation of رَمَضَ الشَّاةَ. (S, TA.)
مَرْمُوضٌ Flesh-meat dressed in the manner
described above in the explanation of رَمَضَ الشَّاةَ:
(S:) or roasted flesh-meat, such as is termed
كَنِيس, [a word with which I have not met
except in this place,] which is nearly the same as
حَنِيذ, save that what is called by this last epithet
is divided into fragments, and then a fire is
kindled over it; as also ↓ رَمِيضٌ. (TA.)
