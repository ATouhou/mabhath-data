ريث1
رَاثَ, (T, S, M, &c.,) aor. يَرِيثُ, (S, Msb,)
inf. n. رَيْثٌ, (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) He, or it,
was, or became, slow, tardy, dilatory, late, or
backward; (T, S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also
↓ تريّث. (T, K.) You say, رَاثَ عَلَىَّ خَبَرُكَ, (S,
A,) or راث عَلَيْنَا خَبَرُهُ, (T,) Thy news or the news
of thee, or his news or the news of him, was slow,
&c., in coming to me, or to us. (T, S, A.) And
عَلَيْنَا فُلَانٌ ↓ تريّث Such a one was slow, &c., in
coming to us. (T.) And رُبَّ عَجَلَةٍ وَ هَبَتْ رَيْثًا,
or, accord. to one relation of the saying, تَهَبُ رَيْثًا,
the meaning in both cases being the same, from
الهِبَةُ; [i. e. Many an act of haste causes (lit.
gives) slowness, &c.;] (S;) or تُعْقِبُ رَيْثًا [occasions, as its result, slowness, &c.]: (A:) a proverb.
(S, A.) And it appears from the following saying
of Maakil Ibn-Khuweylid,
لَعَمْرُكَ لَلْيَأْسُ غَيْرُ المُرِيثِ خَيْرٌ مِنَ الطَّمَعِ الكَاذِبِ
[By thy life, or by thy religion, assuredly despair
that is not slow in its issue is better than hope
that gives a false promise, if this be his meaning,]
that ↓ اراث may be a dial. var. of رَاثَ: but the
poet may mean [that does not make a man slow,
i. e.] غَيْرُ المُرِيثِ المَرْءَ. (M.)

phrase used by one of the companions of Ks.
(M.) ―
-b3-  One says also, رَيَّثَ عَمَّا كَانَ عَلَيْهِ He
fell short, or failed, of doing, or accomplishing,
what was incumbent on him: and in like manner,
رَيَّثَ أَمْرَهُ [He fell short, or failed, of accomplishing his affair]. (M.) ―

اِسْتَغَثْتُهُ فَمَا اسْتَرَثْتُهُ [I sought, or desired, aid,
or succour, of him, and I did not deem him
slow, &c.]. (A, TA.)
رَيْثٌ A space, or measure, [of time,] syn. قَدْرٌ,
(T, Msb,) or مِقْدَارٌ; (A, K;) or a time, a while,
syn. سَاعَةٌ. (Mgh.) You say, أَمْهَلْتُهُ رَيْثَمَا فَعَلَ كَذَا,
i. e. قَدْرَ مَا فَعَلَهُ (Msb) or سَاعَةَ فِعْلِهِ (Mgh) [I
granted him a delay during the space of his doing
such a thing]. And لَمْ يَلْبَثْ إِلَّا رَيْثَمَا قُلْتُ, i. e.
قَدْرَ ذٰلِكَ [He tarried not save during the space
that, or as long as, or while, I said such a thing].
(TA, from a trad.) And so in the saying, مَا قَعَدَ
عِنْدَنَا فُلَانٌ إِلَّا رَيْثَ أَنْ حَدَّثَنَا بِحَدِيثٍ تُمَّ مَرَّ
[Such a one sat not with us, or at our abode,
save during the space that, or as long as, or
while, he related to us a story, or tradition; then
he went away]. (T, TA.) And it is used without
ما and without ان: (TA:) Aashà Báhileh says,
لَا يُصْعِبُ الأَمْرَ إِلَّا رَيْثَ يَرْكَبُهُ
وَ كُلَّ أَمْرٍ سِوَى الفَحْشَآءِ يَأْتَمِرُ
[He finds not the affair difficult save while he is
embarking in it; and every command but that
which exceeds the bounds of rectitude he obeys]:
(M, TA:) this mode of expression is common in
the dial. of El-Hijáz; accord. to which one says,
يُرِيدُ يَفْعَلُ, i. e. أَنْ يَفْعَلَ. (TA.) [See also an
ex. in a verse cited voce رَاجِلَةٌ, and another in a
verse cited voce رِيحٌ.]
رَيْثَةٌ Slowness, tardiness, dilatoriness, lateness,
or backwardness; contr. of عَجَلَةٌ; like [the inf.
n.] رَيْثٌ; (Ham p. 503;) i. q. إِبْطَآءٌ. (Idem
p. 640.)

as also ↓ رَائِثٌ; (A, TA;) the latter occurring in a
trad. (TA.)
مُرَيَّثُ العَيْنَيْنِ, (Fr, S, K,) or العَيْنِ, (A,) A
man (Fr, S, A) slow of sight. (Fr, S, A, K.)
مَا فُلَانٌ بِمُسْتَرَاثِ النُّصْرَةِ [Such a one is not a
person whose aid is deemed slow, tardy, &c.].
(A, TA.)
