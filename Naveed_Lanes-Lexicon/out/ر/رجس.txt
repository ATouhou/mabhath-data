رِجْسٌ Uncleanness, dirt, or filth: or an unclean,
a dirty, or a filthy, thing: syn. قَذَرٌ: (S, A,
Msb, K, TA: [in the CK, القَدَرُ is put by mistake for القَذَرٌ:]) or شَىْءٌ قَذِرٌ: (TA:) anything
that is disliked, or hated, for its uncleanness,
dirtiness, or filthiness: stink, or foul odour:
accord. to Az, filth that comes forth from the
body of a man: En-Nakkásh says that it is syn.
with نِجْسٌ; and it is said in the Bári' that sometimes they say الرَّجَاسَةُ وَالنَّجَاسَةُ, meaning that
they make these two words syn.: (Msb:) it is
also written ↓ رَجِسٌ and ↓ رَجَسٌ: (A, K:) you
say رِجْسٌ نِجْسٌ, and رَجِسٌ نَجِسٌ; and IDrd says,
I think that they also said رَجَسٌ نَجَسٌ: Pr says
that when رجس is followed by نجس, the ج is
with kesr; but when نجس is mentioned without
رجس, the ج and ن are with fet-h. (TA.) You
say also شَىْءٌ رِجْسٌ [An unclean, a dirty, or a
filthy, thing]. (A.) And ↓ مَرَّبِنَا جَمَاعَةٌ رَجِسُونَ
نَجِسُونَ, meaning, A company of unbelievers
passed by us. (IAar and TA.) As used in the
Kur vi. 125, Mujáhid explains الرِّجْس as meaning That in which is no good. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Any
action that is disliked, or hated, for its uncleanness, dirtiness, or filthiness: (Zj, A, K:) a sin,
or crime: (Ibn-El-Kelbee, A, K:) so in the
Kur v. 92, and vi. 146: (Ibn-El-Kelbee:) an
action that leads to punishment: (T, A, K:) as
رَجْسٌ signifies “ vehemence of sound,” [see 1,]
رِجْسٌ seems to mean an action the mention
whereof is evil, and highly evil: (TA:) sometimes it signifies a thing that is unlawful, or
forbidden: and unbelief: infidelity: (L:) and
doubt: (Aboo-Jaafar, A, K:) so in the Kur
xxxiii. 33. (Aboo-Jaafar.) ―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  Punishment;
(Fr, T, S, A, K;) a sense which Z makes tropical, as being the recompense of رِجْس [in the
sense of “ sin ”], (TA;) and anger: (Fr, S, A,
K:) so in the Kur x. 100: like رِجْزٌ, which is
perhaps formed from it by the change of س into
ز: (Fr, S:) and sometimes, malediction, or execration. (L.)
-A2-  A light, or slight, motion.
(TA.)
-A3-  Suggestion of the devil. (TA.)

This is a goodly thunderer. (S.) And عَفَتِ الدِّيَارَ
الغَمَائِمُ الرَّوَاجِسُ وَالرِّيَاحُ الرَّوَامِسُ [The loudthundering clouds and the dust-spreading winds
effaced the traces of the dwellings]. (A.) ―

in like manner,] ↓ رَجَّاسٌ (S, K) and ↓ رَجُوسٌ and
↓ مِرْجَسٌ (K) A camel that brays vehemently.
(S, K, * TA.) You say also الحَنِينِ ↓ نَاقَةٌ رَجْسَآءُ,
[fem. of ↓ أَرْجَسُ,] A she-camel that utters the
[yearning cry termed] حَنِين consecutively, or continuously. (IAar, TA.) ―

The sea: (K:) because of the sound of its waves;
or because of its commotion. (TA.)
-A2-  رَاجِسٌ
also signifies The thrower of the مِرْجَاس; (K;)

مِرْجَاسٌ A stone which is tied to the end of a
rope, and which is then let down into a well, and
stirs up its black mud, after which the water is
drawn forth, and thus the well is cleansed: (S,
K: *) or a stone which is thrown into a well in
order that one may know, by the sound thereof,
its depth; or that one may know whether there
be in it water or not: (IAar, K:) or, accord. to
ISd, the name by which this is known is مِرْدَاسٌ.
(TA.)
إِنَّهُ لَرِجْسٌ مَرْجُوسٌ and رجل مَرْجُوسٌ [are phrases
mentioned, but not explained, in the TA: but I
think that رجل is a mistranscription for رِجْزٌ; and
that مرجوس, in each case, is a corroborative].
هُمْ فِى مَرْجُوسَةٍ, (S, A, K,) and ↓ فى مَرْجُوسَآءَ,
(TA,) They are in a state of confusion (S, A, K)
and perturbation, (A,) مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ in respect of
their affair, or case. (S, TA.)
مَرْجُوسَآءُ: see what next precedes.
مُرْتَجِسٌ: see رَاجِسٌ.
نَرْجِسٌ (S, Msb, K) and نِرْجِسٌ (AA, Sgh, Msb,
K) [The narcissus;] a certain sweet-smelling
flower, (Msb, * TA,) well known: (Msb, K:)
the smell of which is beneficial for the cold
rheum and the cold headache: (K:) the word
is arabicized, (S, Msb, TA,) from [the Persian] نَرْگِسْ: (TA:) [this being the case, the ن
should be regarded as radical it is said, however, that] the ن in نَرْجِسٌ is augmentative,
because there is no word of the measure فَعْلِلٌ,
but there is of the measure نَفْعِلٌ, (S,) though
only what is changed, in application, from a
verb: (Msb:) but نِرْجِسٌ is of the measure فِعْلِلُ;
(TA;) or it is of the measure نِفْعِلٌ, the augmentative letter being made to accord in its vowel
with the radical letter in إِذْخِرٌ and that in إِثْمِدٌ
&c.: (Msb:) or, accord. to IDrd, نَرْجِسٌ is of the
measure فَعْلِلٌ, and the only instance of that
measure. (TA in art. نرجس.) If you name a
man نَرْجِس, you make it imperfectly decl., because
it is like نَضْرِبُ: (S:) but if you name him
نِرْجِس, it is perfectly decl., because it is of the
measure فِعْلِلٌ (TA) [or نِفْعِلٌ, neither of which
is the measure of a verb]. ―
