ريب1
رَابَنِى, (T, S, M, &c.,) aor. يَرِيبُ, (M, Mgh,
Msb, K,) inf. n. رَيْبٌ (T, M, Mgh, Msb, &c.) and
رِيبَةٌ, (M, K,) or the latter is a simple subst.,
(S, Msb,) It (a thing) occasioned in me disquiet,
disturbance, or agitation, of mind: (Ksh and Bd
in ii. 1:) [this is the primary signification; (see
رِيبَةٌ;) a signification also borne by ↓ أَرَابَنِى; (see
the verses of Khálid cited in this paragraph;)
whence the other significations here expl. in what
follows:] it (a thing) made me to doubt: (Msb:
and in like manner رَابَهُ is expl. in the Mgh:) or
it (a thing, M) caused me to have what is termed
رِيبَة [i. e. doubt, or suspicion or evil opinion, or
doubt combined with suspicion or evil opinion];
as also ↓ أَرَابَنِى: (M, K: in both of which this
meaning is indicated, but not expressed:) but the
latter is said by Lth to be bad: (T:) or, (T, M,
Msb,) accord. to AZ, (T, Msb,) the former signifies he, (T, M, *) or it, i. e. his case, (M, * Msb,)
made me to know that there was on his part what
is termed رِيبَة [i. e. something occasioning doubt,
or suspicion or evil opinion, or doubt combined
with suspicion or evil opinion]; (T, M, Msb;)
made me to be certain, or sure, of it: (Msb:)
and ↓ the latter signifies made me to think that
there was in him what is so termed; (Sb, T, M,
Msb, K;) without my being certain, or sure, of
it: (Msb:) [Az says that] these are the right
explanations of the two phrases: (T:) [or] the
latter signifies also جَعَلَ فِىَّ الرِّيَبَةَ [he put into
me, i. e. into my mind, doubt, or suspicion &c.];
(Sb, M, K; and in a similar manner أَرَبْتُهُ is expl.
in the latter;) or أَوْهَمَنِى الرِّيبَةَ [he made me to
think that which occasioned doubt, or suspicion
&c.]: (K: and in like manner ارابهُ is expl. in the
Ham p. 363:) and رِبْتُهُ signifies أَوْصَلْتُ إِلَيْهِ الرِّيبَةَ
[I made doubt, or suspicion &c., or that which
occasioned doubt, or suspicion &c., to come to
him, or to reach him]; (K;) [app. by some act;
for it is said that] رَابَهُ signifies أَتَاهُ بِرِيبَةٍ [he did
to him a thing that occasioned doubt, or suspicion
&c.]: (Ham ubi suprà:) or, (K,) accord. to Lh,
the Arabs say, (M,) رَابَنِى أَمْرُهُ, aor. يَرِيبُنِى, inf. n.
رَيْبٌ and رِيبَةٌ: when they speak allusively [with
respect to the cause of doubt &c., not expressing
it,] (إِذَا كَنَوْا [misinterpreted in the TA as meaning “ when they affix a pronoun to the verb,” for
the meaning here intended is clearly shown by
what follows,]) they prefix ا [to the verb, saying
↓ أَرَابَ, and أَرَبْتُ, &c., expl. in the latter part of
this paragraph]; and when they do not speak
allusively [with respect to the cause of doubt &c.,
but express it,] (إِذَا لَمْ يَكْنُوا) they reject that
letter; but [so accord. to the M, but in the K
“ or,”] it is allowable to say, الأَمْرُ ↓ أَرَابَنِى; (M,
K;) i. e., to prefix the ا when the verb is made
trans.: (M:) accord. to As, (T,) رَابَنِى [signifies
he did what made me to doubt, or to have doubt,
or suspicion &c, and what I disliked, or hated;
for it] is said of a man when thou seest, on his
part, what makes thee to doubt, &c., (مَا يُرِيبُكَ,
[or مَا يَرِيبُكَ,]) and what thou dislikest, or hatest:
(T, S:) and Hudheyl say, ↓ أَرَابَنِى, (T, S, Msb,)
or ارابنى أَمْرُهُ, as As says on the authority of 'Eesà
Ibn-'Omar; (M;) and رِبْتُ and ↓ اِرْتَبْتُ, meaning I doubted: (Msb:) accord. to IAth, رَابَنِى
الشَّكُّ [an evident mistranscription for رابنى الشَّىْءُ]
and ↓ ارابنى both mean شَكَّكَنِى وَ أَوْهَمَنِى الرِّيبَةَ بِهِ
[i. e. the thing made me to doubt, and caused me
to think that there was that which occasioned
doubt, or suspicion &c., in it]; but when you are
certain, or sure, of it, you say [only] رَابَنِى, without [an incipient] ا: (TA:) accord. to Lth, رَابَنِى
الأَمْرُ, inf. n. رَيْبٌ, signifies the thing, or event,
[app. said only of that which is evil,] betided me,
or befell me: and رَابَنِى أَمْرُهُ, his affair, or case,
brought upon me doubt (شَكًّا [in the TA شَرًّا i. e.
evil]) and fear. (T.) It is said in a trad., of
Fátimeh, يَرِيبُنِى مَا يَرِيبُهَا, meaning That displeases and disquiets me which displeases and disquiets her. (TA.) And in another, respecting a
gazelle lying curled in sleep, لَا يَرِيبُهُ أَحَدٌ بِشَىْءٍ,
meaning No one shall oppose himself to it and
disquiet it, or disturb it. (TA.) And in another,
مَا رَابَكَ إِلَى قَطْعِهَا, i. e. What disquieted thee and
constrained thee to cut it off? as Aboo-Moosà
thinks the phrase may be read: but see another
reading voce رَابٌ. (TA.) And in another, دَعْ مَا
وَ إِنَّ ↓ يَرِيبُكَ إِلَى مَا لَا يَريبُكَ فَإِنَّ الكَذِبَ رِيبَةٌ
الصِّدْقَ طُمَأْنِينَةٌ, (Mgh, TA, *) or, as some relate
it, ↓ يُرِيبُكَ, (TA,) i. e. Leave thou that which
causeth thee to doubt, (Mgh, TA, *) and occasioneth in thee الرِّيبَة, which originally signifies
disquiet, or disturbance, or agitation, of mind,
[and hence suspicion &c., and betake thyself to
that which will not cause thee to doubt, &c., for
verily lying is a thing that occasions disquiet of
mind, or doubt, or suspicion &c., and verily
veracity is a thing that occasions tranquillity;]
because the mind is not at rest when it doubts,
but becomes tranquil when it is certain, or sure.
(Mgh.) And the Hudhalee, (S, TA,) Khálid Ibn-Zuheyr, (TA,) says,
يَا قَوْمِ مَا لِى وَ أَبَا ذُؤَيْبِ
كُنْتُ إِذَا أَتَوْتُهُ مِنْ غَيْبِ
يَشُمُّ عِطْفِى وَ يَجُرُّ ثَوْبِى
بِرَيْبِ ↓ كَأَنَّنِى أَرَبْتُهُ
[O my people, what aileth me with Aboo-Dhueyb? I was (such that) when I came to him
after absence, or from being absent, he would
smell my side, or my armpit, and pull my garment, as though I disquieted his mind with doubt,
or suspicion &c.]: (S and TA, in this art. and in
art. بز; but in the latter with يَبُزُّ in the place of
its syn. يَجُرُّ:) it is said in the L that اراب is
trans. and intrans.; and that he who makes it
trans. makes it syn. with رَابَ; and thus it is in
the saying of Khálid cited above; the last hemistich of which is also related thus:
كَأَنَّنِى قَدْ رِبْتُهُ بِرَيْبِ
but ↓ اراب when intrans. signifies أَتَى بِرِيبَةٍ
[meaning he did an act that occasioned doubt, or
suspicion &c.]; like as أَلَامَ signifies أَتَى بِمَا يُلَامُ
عَلَيْهِ [he did an act for which he was to be
blamed]: and agreeably with this signification is
expl. the verse ascribed to El-Mutalemmis, or to
Beshshár Ibn-Burdeh,
أَخُوكَ الَّذِى إِنْ رِبْتَهُ قَالَ إِنَّمَا
وَ إِنْ لَايَنْتَهُ لَانَ جَانِبُهْ ↓ أَرَبْتُ
[Thy brother is he who, if thou make him to
doubt, &c., (or if thou do to him an act occasioning doubt, or suspicion &c., as expl. in the Ham
p. 363, where عَاتَبْتَهُ is put in the place of لَايَنْتَهُ,)
says, Only I have done what occasions doubt,
&c.; and if thou act gently with him, becomes
gentle]: thus the verse is correctly related: he
who relates it differently, saying أَرَبْتَ, [and thus
I find it in two copies of the T,] asserts that
إِنْ رِبْتَهُ means if thou make him of necessity to
have doubt, or suspicion &c.; and ↓ اربت [here
said in the TA to be “ with damm,” but this is
evidently a mistranscription for “ with fet-h,”
for it cannot mean with damm to the ا, as أُرِبْتَ
does not bear an appropriate signification, nor
can it mean with damm to the ت, as the explanation relates to the reading of اربت with fet-h to
the ت,] means thou hast caused [me] to think
that there was that which occasioned doubt, or
suspicion &c., when it was not decidedly necessary.
(TA.)

اراب, as a trans. verb: see 1, in eight places.
-A2-  As intrans., it signifies He (a man) was, or
became, one in whom was something occasioning
doubt, or suspicion or evil opinion, or doubt
combined with suspicion or evil opinion; i. e.
صَارَ ذَا رِيبَةِ: (Sb, T, S, M:) and he did a thing
that occasioned doubt, or suspicion &c.: (As, T:)
it is said when one is told something of a person,
or thinks it, or imagines it: (Msb:) see 1, in the
former half of the paragraph; and also, in three
places, in the latter part of the same paragraph.
Also It (a thing, or an affair, or a case,) was, or
became, one in which was something occasioning
doubt, or suspicion &c.; i. e. صَارَ ذَا رَيْبٍ (T, K)
or ذا رِيبَةٍ. (M.)
5
تَرَيَّبَ see the next paragraph.
8
ارتاب He doubted, (S, Msb, K,) فِيهِ [respecting him, or it]. (S.) See 1, in the former
half of the paragraph. And ارتاب بِهِ He suspected him, or thought evil of him: (T, M, K:)
or he saw on his part [or in him] what caused
him to have doubt, or suspicion &c.; as also
به ↓ تريّب; (Har p. 257;) and به ↓ استراب; i. e.
رَأَى مِنْهُ مَا يَرِيبُهُ: (S, K, and Har ubi suprà:)
the last used by [the tribe of] Hudheyl. (TA.)
―
-b2-  [It often means particularly He was sceptical
in matters of religion.]
10
استراب He fell into that which occasioned
doubt, or suspicion or evil opinion; meaning he
feared so that he doubted of safety or security:
(Har pp. 256 and 257:) [he conceived doubt, or
suspicion or evil opinion:] he doubted: and
became infected with suspicion or evil opinion.
(Idem p. 309.) See also 8.
رَابٌ Want, or need. (TA.) Hence, in a trad.,
مَا رَبُكُمْ إِلَيْهِ What is [the reason of] your want of
him? or your wanting to ask him? (TA.) And, in
another trad., مَا رَابُكَ إِلَى قَطْعِهَا What is [the
reason of] thy wanting to cut it off? thus, says
El-Khattábee, they relate it, with damm to the
ب: but IAth says that it is properly مَا أَرَبُكَ,
meaning the same: or, accord. to Aboo-Moosà,
the right reading may be ما رَابَكَ, expl. in the
preceding paragraph. (TA.)
رَيْبٌ is an inf. n. of 1, (T, M, Mgh, Msb, &c.,)
as also ↓ رِيبَةٌ, (M, K,) or the latter is a simple
subst.: (S, Msb:) the primary signification of the
latter [and of the former also when it is used as a
simple subst.] is Disquiet, disturbance, or agitation, of mind: (Ksh and Bd in ii. 1:) [and
hence] the former signifies doubt; (T, S, Msb;)
as also ↓ the latter; (S, Mgh;) because doubt
disquiets, or disturbs, the mind: (Ksh and Bd
ubi suprà, and Mgh:) and opinion; syn. ظَنٌّ:
(Msb:) and ↓ the latter, (S, M, A, Mgh, K,) and
the former also, (M, A, K,) doubt, or suspicion
or evil opinion; syn. تُهَمَةٌ (S, M, A, Mgh, K)
and ظِنَّةٌ: (M, A, K:) or the former, [and ↓ the
latter also,] doubt combined with suspicion or evil
opinion: (IAth, TA:) and a thing, or an event,
or a case, that occasions one doubt, or suspicion
or evil opinion, or doubt combined with suspicion
or evil opinion; i. e. مَا رَابَكَ مِنْ أَمْرٍ: (S, TA:)
[in this last sense, the latter is the more common:
hence,] lying is termed رِيبَةٌ in a trad. cited
above: see 1: (Mgh:) the ↓ pl. of the latter is
رِيَبٌ. (Msb.) A man, and a thing or an event
or a case, is said to be ↓ ذُو رِيبَةٍ [as meaning
Having in him, or it, something occasioning
doubt, or suspicion &c.]. (A.) [لَا رَيْبَ often
occurs as meaning There is no doubt; without
doubt; undoubtedly.] ―
-b2-  Hence, رَيْبُ الزَّمَانِ The
accidents, or evil accidents, of time, (Ksh and Bd
ubi suprà, [in Fleischer's ed. of the latter رِيَب
الزمان, which is more agreeable with the explanation, but رَيْب الزمان is more usual,]) that disquiet, or disturb, the minds and hearts: (Ksh:)
and رَيْبُ المَنُونِ (S, A) [which likewise signifies]
the accidents, or evil accidents, of time: (S:) and
رَيْبُ الدَّهْرِ signifies the same; i. e. صَرْفُهُ, (M, K,)
or صُرُوفُهُ, (T, Msb,) and حَوَادِثُهُ. (T. [This is
said in the TA to be tropical; but I do not find
it so characterized in the A.]) ―
-b3-  [Hence, likewise,] رَيْبٌ also signifies A want; a needful, or
requisite, thing, affair, or business; syn. حَاجَةٌ.
(S, A, Msb, K.) A poet says, (S,) namely, Kaab
Ibn-Málik El-Ansáree, (TA,)
قَضَيْنَا مِنْ تِهَامَةَ كُلَّ رَيْبٍ
وَ خَيْبَرَ ثُمَّ أَجْيَيْنَا السُّيُوفَا
[We accomplished, from Tihámeh, every want,
and from Kheyber: then we gave rest to our
swords]. (S.)
-A2-  [ريب mentioned by Freytag as
applied in art. دلس of the S to a certain plant,
and written رَيْب in both of my copies of the S in
that art., is a mistake for رَبَب, which is the
reading in the TA, pl. of رِبَّةٌ.]
رِيبَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in six
places. ―
-b2-  [It often means particularly Scepticism
in matters of religion.]
أَمْرٌ رَيَّابٌ A thing, or an event, or a case, that
frightens, or terrifies. (M, K.)
رَائِبٌ [act. part. n. of 1; Causing, or occasioning, doubt, or suspicion or evil opinion, &c.]
IAar says that Aboo-Bekr is related to have said,
in his charge to 'Omar, عَلَيْكَ بِالرَّائِبِ مِنَ الأُمُورِ
وَ إِيَّاك وَ الرَّائِبَ مِنْهَا, which Th explains as meaning
Keep thou to what is clear, free from dubiousness
or confusedness, of affairs, and beware thou of, or
avoid thou, what has in it dubiousness, or confusedness, thereof: (T, TA:) the first is from
رَابَ of which the aor. is يَرُوبُ, said of milk; and
the second is from رَابَ of which the aor. is يَرِيبُ.
(TA.) [See also a verse cited voce رَائِبٌ in art.
روب, and my remark thereon.]
مُرِيبٌ, applied to a man, (T, S, A,) and to a
thing or an event, (M, A,) i. q. ذُو رِيبَةٍ [expl.
above, voce رَيْبٌ]. (T, S, M, A.) إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا فِى
شَكٍّ مُرِيبٍ, in the Kur xxxiv. last verse, means
Verily they were in doubt causing to fall into
suspicion or evil opinion: or it means ذِى رِيبَةٍ
[having in it something occasioning suspicion
&c.]: (Ksh and Bd:) or ذِى رَيْبٍ [which means
the same: or attended with disquiet, or disturbance, or agitation, of mind]: (M, TA:) [see its
verb, 4:] it may be from the trans. or from the
intrans. verb. (Ksh.)
مُرْتَابٌ Doubting [or suspecting]. (Msb.) ―
-b2-
[It often means particularly Sceptical, or a sceptic,
in matters of religion.
-A2-  And مُرْتَابٌ فِيهِ, or بِهِ,
Doubted of, or suspected.]
