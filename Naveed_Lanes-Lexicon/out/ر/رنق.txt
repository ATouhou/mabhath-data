[Hence,] one says, رنّق اللّٰهُ قَذَاتَكَ May God

K)
-A2-  Also, as an intrans. verb, He was, or became, confounded, or perplexed, and unable to see

man's standing, not knowing whether to go or
come. (TA.) And The being weak, or infirm,
[and, app., disordered, or perturbed,] in sight, and
in body, and in an affair or case. (S, K.) Hence,

or opinion, [that they formed, or they were confused in judgment or opinion,] in, or respecting,
the affair, or case. (S, K.) ―

wait thou, wait thou, (JK, S, TA,) for their

and he flapped his wings. (TA.) Hence, said of
a captive, He stretched out his neck on the

wings. (TA.) [Hence also,] رنّقت السَّفِينَةُ (JK,
TA) فِى مَكَانِهَا (JK) The ship turned round in its
