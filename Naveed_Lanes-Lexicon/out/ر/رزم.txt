-b2- رازم
بَيْنَهُمَا He conjoined them two; (K;) [as, for

pastured upon the حَمْض [or salt, or sour, plants]
one time, and خُلَّة [or sweet plants] another time,

signifies the making an interchange, by eating

of] eating with thanks, and the mouthfuls with

the mentioning God between every two mouthfuls:
(Th, TA:) or the eating the soft and the dry or
tough [alternately], and the sweet and the sour,
and the unseasoned, or disagreeable in taste, and
the seasoned: agreeably with all of these interpretations is explained the saying of 'Omar, إِذَا
أَكَلْتُمْ فَرَازمُوا: (K, TA:) as though he said,
[When ye eat,] eat what is easy and agreeable to
swallow with what is unseasoned, or disagreeable
in taste: (TA:) or mix ye, in your eating, what
is soft with what is rough, or harsh, or coarse:
(IAth, TA:) or make ye praise to follow [your

ارزمت She (a camel) uttered a cry such as
is termed رَزَمَة [q. v.] when loving, or affecting,
her young one: (S:) or she (a camel) uttered a
cry of yearning towards her young one: (K:)
and in like manner, ارزمت عَلَى وَلَدِهَا is said of a
ewe, or she-goat: but sometimes إِرْزَامٌ means the uttering of a cry, or sound, absolutely: and ارزمت
said of a she-camel occurs in a trad. as meaning she
uttered a cry. (TA.) One says, لَا أَفْعَلُ ذَاكَ مَا
أَرْزَمَتْ أُمُّ حَائِلٍ [I will not do that as long as a
mother of a female young camel utters her gentle
yearning cry]: (S, K: *) a prov. (K.) And
hence, i. e. from ارزمت said of a she-camel,
(TA,) ارزم is also said of thunder, (S, K,) meaning (tropical:)  It made a vehement sound, or noise: (K,
TA:) or it made a sound, or noise, (S, K,) not
vehement. (K.) [And it seems that ↓ رَزِمَتْ and
رَزِمَ signify the same as ارزمت and ارزم said of a
she-camel and of thunder: for] the inf. n. رَزَمٌ,
used in relation to a camel and to thunder, signify
The making a sound or noise. (KL.) ارزمت is
also said of a cooking-pot, meaning (assumed tropical:)  It made a
noise by its boiling. (Ham p. 663.) And you
say, ارزمت الرِّيحُ فِى الجَوْفِ (assumed tropical:)  The wind made a
sound [in the belly]. (K.)
رَزِمٌ Rain accompanied by incessant thunder:
a possessive epithet. (Lh, TA.)
رُزَمٌ Firm, or steadfast, standing upon the
ground: (S, K:) and ↓ مُرْزِمٌ and ↓ رَازِمٌ signify
[the same; or] firm, or steadfast, upon the
ground: and the pl. of the last is رُزَّامٌ, occurring
in a verse cited voce رِزَامٌ, q. v. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also
The lion; and so ↓ مُرْزِمٌ; (K, TA;) because he
lies upon his breast on his prey, not quitting it:
(TA:) or رُزَمٌ (Ham p. 362) and ↓ رَزَامٌ (TA, and
Ham ibid., [but in the latter without any syll.
signs,]) like سَحَابٌ, and ↓ رَزَامَةٌ like سَحَابَةٌ,
[which is of a form denoting intensiveness of signification,] (TA,) are epithets applied to a lion, meaning that lies upon his breast on his prey, (Ham,
TA,) and growls. (Ham.) Accord. to J, it is
applied in a verse of Sáïdeh Ibn-Ju-eiyeh to an
elephant: but accord. to IB, and the Expos. of
Skr, it is there applied to a lion, as meaning That
has remained firm, or steadfast, in his place.
(TA.)
رَزْمَةٌ: see 1: ―
-b2-  and see also the next paragraph, in two places. ―
-b3- أَكَلَ الرَّزْمَةٌ He ate the
وَجْبَة [or meal that sufficed for a day and a night,
or for four and twenty hours]. (K.)
رِزْمَةٌ A quantity remaining in a [receptacle of
the kind called] جُلَّة, [a meaning said in the TA,
in art. ردم, to be erroneously assigned in the K,
in that art, to رِدْمَةٌ,] of dates, amounting to half
thereof, or a third, or thereabout: (TA:) or,
accord. to Sh, the third part, or fourth part, of
a [sack such as is called] غِرَارَة, (Mgh, TA,) or
thereabout, (Mgh,) of dates or flour: or, accord.
to Zeyd Ibn-Kuthweh, like قَوْسٌ, signifying the
quantity of the fourth part of the جُلَّة, of dates:
(TA:) or, accord. to the Tekmileh, [the pl.]
رِزَمٌ signifies the [sacks called] غَرَائِر, in which is
wheat: and hence the رِزَم of clothes [explained in
what here follows. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  A كَارَة [or bundle,
put in one piece of cloth and tied up,] of clothes;
(S, Msb, TA;) what are tied up in one piece of
cloth, (K, TA,) of clothes: (TA:) or clothes,
and other things, put together [in a bundle]; as
also ↓ رَزْمَةٌ: (Mgh:) IAmb explains it as meaning the thing in which are sorts (ضُرَوب) and
mixtures of clothes: and hence the author of the
K has taken a meaning assigned by him to رِزْمَةٌ,
which, he says, is also written ↓ رَزْمَةٌ, namely,
ضَرْبٌ شَدِيدٌ [a vehement beating], altering and
substituting: (TA:) the pl. of رِزْمَةٌ is رِزَمٌ. (S,
Msb.)
رَزَمَةٌ A cry, or sound, (AZ, S, K, TA,) a sort
of yearning cry, (TA,) of a she-camel, when
loving, or affecting, her young one, uttered from
her throat, or fauces, (AZ, S, K, TA,) without
opening her mouth, not as loud as that which is
termed حَنِينٌ. (AZ, S, TA.) It is said in a prov.,
رَزَمَةٌ وَلَا دِرَّةٌ [A gentle yearning cry of a she-camel,
and no flow of milk]: (S:) or لَا خَيْرَ فِى رَزَمَةٍ
لَا دِرَّةَ فِيهَا [There is no good in a gentle yearning
cry of a she-camel with which is no flow of milk]:
(K:) applied to him who promises and does not
fulfil: (S, K:) or to him who causes to wish and
does not act: (A, TA:) or to him who makes a
show of love, or affection, without proving it to
be true or without;t its being accompanied by any
gift. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also The cry of a boy, or
child. (K, TA: but not in the CK.) ―
-b3-  And,
accord. to IAar, A vehement cry or sound.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  And The cries of beasts of prey. (S,
TA.) A poet says,
لِلسِّبَاعِ حَوْلَهُ رَزَمَهْ  تَرَكُوا عَمْرَانَ مُنْجَدِلاً
[They left 'Amrán prostrate upon the ground;
there being cries of the beasts of prey around
him]. (IB, TA.)
رَزَامٌ: see رُزَمٌ.
رِزَامٌ A man strong and stubborn. (K.) رُزَامٌ,
[a mistranscription, app. for ↓ رَزَّامٌ, for it must be
with teshdeed to the ز, as is shown by an ex. in a
copy of the S, consisting of two verses, of which
the former here follows,] as an epithet applied to
a man, means Stubborn, behaving with forced
hardness or hardiness: it occurs, accord. as some
relate it, in the saying of a rájiz, [so in the S and
TA, but correctly, a poet using the sixth species
of the metre termed السَّرِيع,] which others relate thus:
↓ أَيَا بَنِى عَبْدِ مَنَافِ الرُّزَّامْ
أَنْتُمْ حُمَاةٌ وَأَبُوكُمُ حَامٌ
[O sons of 'Abd-Menáf, the firm, or steadfast,
upon the ground, (accord. to this reading; but
accord. to the reading that seems to be رَزَّامْ, the
stubborn, &c., as a sing., referring to 'AbdMenáf himself;) ye are defenders, and your
father was a defender, حَامْ being for حَامٍ]: رُزَّام
being pl. of رَازِمٌ. (So in one of my two copies of
the S: in the other copy omitted.)
رَزِيمٌ A roaring, or growling: a poet says,
لِأُسُوِدهِنَّ عَلَى الطَّرِيقِ رَزِيمُ
[There is, or was, a roaring, or growling, of
their lions on the road]. (S.)
رَزَامَةٌ: see رُزَمٌ.
الرِّزَامِيَّةُ A sect who said that the office of
Imám, after 'Alee, belonged to Mohammad Ibn-El-Hanafeeyeh, and then to his son 'Abd-Allah,
and who accounted lawful those things that are
[esteemed by the orthodox] forbidden: (KT:) or
a sect of the extravagant zealots of the class of
innovators, of the schismatics, or followers of
'Alee, who say that the office of Imám belonged
to Aboo-Muslim El-Khurásánee, after El-Man-
soor, and some of whom arrogated to themselves
divinity, one of them being El-Mukanna', who
made the moon to appear to them in Nakhshab,
and of whose persuasion there is in this day a
party in Má-wará-en-Nahr. (TA.)
رَزَّامٌ: see رِزَامٌ. ―

fatigue and emaciation, (Lh, TA,) or in consequence of emaciation (S, K, TA) arising from
hunger or disease: (TA:) and in like manner
applied to a man, &c.: (Lh, TA:) and also,
[without ة,] applied to a she-camel, meaning
standing still, or stopping from journeying, in
consequence of fatigue and emaciation, and motionless: (S:) pl. رَزْمَى and رِزَامٌ, [accord. to Freytag رُزَمٌ,] applied to camels. (TA.) ―

مُرْزِمٌ: see رُزَمٌ, in two places.
المِرْزَمُ is a name of The right star [app.
γ, i. e.
Bellatrix,] in the left arm of الجَبَّار [or Orion].
(Kzw. [Golius says, as on the authority of Kzw,
that it is “ a star in the right shoulder of Orion: ”
but Kzw says that this star (which is a of Orion)
is called مَنْكِبُ الجَوْزَآءِ and يَدُ الجَوْزَآءِ; and then
he mentions that in the left arm, as being called
المرزم: whence it seems that Golius was misled
by the omission of some words in a copy of the
work of Kzw.]) And المِرْزَمَانِ, (S, K,) also
called مِرْزَمَا الشِّعْرَيَيْنِ, (S,) is the name of Two
stars [of which one is commonly known as B of
Canis Major, and the other is app. B of Canis
Minor, though Golius says, on the authority of
Ulugh Beg, that the former is in the right hind
leg of Canis Major,] with the شِعْرَيَانِ [by which
latter appellation are meant Sirius and Procyon],
(K,) or one of which is in [or by] الشِّعْرَى [commonly so called, i. e. Sirius,] and the other is in
الذِّرَاع [by which is meant الذِّرَاع المَقْبُوضَة, i. e.
the asterism consisting of a and B of Canis Minor]; (S;) or one of them is الذراع المقبوضة
[mentioned above and the other is الشِّعْرَى (q. v.)
commonly so called]: thus says Ibn-Kunáseh:
both are of the stars of rain: and sometimes the
sing. appellation (المِرْزَمُ) is used [app. as applied
to Sirius, or to Bellatrix, or perhaps to B of Canis
Minor]. (TA.) نَوْءُ المِرْزَمِ [means The auroral
setting of some one of the stars above mentioned;
for it] is so termed because of its intense cold.
(TA. See 1.) السَّمَاكُ المِرْزَمُ is another name for
السِّمَاكُ الرَّامِحُ [The star Arcturus]. (Az and TA
in art. رمح. [This star neither sets nor rises

during “ the first of the rains,” the autumnal
rain, called الوَسْمِىّ.]) ―
-b2- أُمُّ مِرْزَمٍ (tropical:)  The north

one cleaves to the ground; or] I made him to
cleave to the ground. (K.)
