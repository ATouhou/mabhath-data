(TA.) See also 3. ―
-b2-  رَبَطَ عَلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  He held back,
or drew back, from him, or it; as though he
confined, and bound, himself. (TA, from a trad.)

strong, and firm, and resolute, (K, * TA,) so that
he did not flee on the occasion of fear. (TA.
[In the CK, رَبَطَ جَأْشَهُ, which would be more
properly rendered (tropical:)  He strengthened, or fortified,
his heart.]) ―
-b4-  رَبَطَ لِذٰلِكَ الأَمْرِ جَأْشًا (tropical:)  He constrained himself to be patient, and confined, or

or strengthened them with patience. (Bd.) And
in like manner in [viii. 11 and] xxviii. 9. (TA.)

المُرَابَطَةُ signifies, (K, TA,) in its primary
acceptation, (TA,) Two [hostile] parties' tying
of their horses, each at their frontier, and each
in preparation for the other: (K, TA:) and
رِبَاطُ الخَيْلِ and مُرَابَطَتُهَا signify the same [as
above]. (S, TA.) [You say, رَابَطَ الفَرِيقَانِ The
two parties tied their horses at their respective
frontiers, each in preparation for the other.]
And one says, with reference to horses, ↓ رَبَطَ,
inf. n. رَبْطٌ and رِبَاطٌ, as well as رابط, inf. n. مُرَابَطَةٌ
and رِبَاطٌ. (Bd in viii. 62.) Hence, (Sgh, L, K,)
رابط, (Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. رِبَاطٌ (S, Mgh, Sgh, L,
K) and مُرَابَطَةٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) He, or it,
(an army, Mgh) kept post, or remained, on, or at,
the frontier (S, Mgh, Sgh, L, K) of the enemy,
(S, Msb, K,) or over against the enemy. (Mgh.)
And hence, i. e. from this latter application,
(AAF, TA,) رابط الأَمْرَ, (TK,) inf. n. رِبَاطٌ (AAF,
K) and مُرَابَطَةٌ, (TK,) (assumed tropical:)  He kept, or applied himself, constantly, perseveringly, or assiduously, to
the thing, or affair. (AAF, K, TK.) It is said
in the Kur [ch. iii., last verse], اصْبِرُوا وَصَابِرُوا
وَرَابِطُوا Be ye patient in endurance of what your
religion requires, and vie ye in patience with
your enemy, and persevere ye in fighting against
your enemy, (Mgh, TA,) and in tying the horses
[at the frontier]: (TA:) or the last of these
verbs means keep ye post, or remain ye, on, or at,
the frontier [of the enemy]: (Az, K:) or (assumed tropical:)  be ye
mindful of the times of prayer: or (assumed tropical:)  apply yourselves constantly, perseveringly, or assiduously, to
prayer: (TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  wait ye for prayer after
prayer; the doing this being termed by the Prophet رِبَاطٌ; (Az, K, TA;) which word, thus used,
is an inf. n. of رَابَطْتُ; or, as some say, a simple
subst., meaning, in this case, a thing whereby one
is tied from acts of disobedience, and restrained
from forbidden deeds. (TA.) [See also صَابَرَ.]
6
ترابط المَآءُ فِى مَكَانِ كَذَا وَكَذَا (tropical:)  The water
remained in, or did not quit, or go forth from,
such and such a place. (TA.)

إِرْتَبَطَ see 1, in three places. ―
-b2-  ارتبط فَرَسًا He
took a horse for the purpose of tying him, or
keeping post, on the enemy's frontier. (K, * TA.)
-A2-  [He, or it, became tied, bound, or made fast.]
―
-b2-  ارتبط فِى الحَبْلِ He became caught, or entangled, in the rope. (Lh.) ―
-b3-  اِرْتِبَاطٌ is also explained by AO and Ez-Zejjájee as syn. with
اعْتلَاقٌ. (TA.) [Thus, ارتبطهُ signifies He, or it,
attached himself, or itself, or clung, or clave, to
him, or it: (see a citation from Lebeed, voce
بَعْضٌ:) and app. also (assumed tropical:)  he loved him.]
رِبَاطٌ A thing with which one ties, binds, or
makes fast, (S, Msb, K,) a skin, (S, Msb,) and a
beast, (S,) &c.; (S, Msb;) a rope with which a
beast is tied: (Mgh:) pl. رُبُطٌ (S, Msb, K) and
رُبْطٌ; (S, TA;) the latter a contraction of the
former: (TA:) and ↓ مِرْبَطٌ and ↓ مِرْبَطَةٌ also
signify a thing with which a beast is tied. (K.)
It is said in a prov., إِنْ ذَهَبَ عَيْرٌ فَعَيْرٌ فِى الرِّبَاطِ
[If an ass is gone away, an ass is tied to the
cord]: relating to contentment with what is present and relinquishment of what is absent. (Mgh.)
[See also 3.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,] used by the vulgar in
the sense of أُخْذَةٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  A kind of fascination by which enchantresses withhold their husbands
from other women. (TA in art. اخذ.) ―
-b3-  A
snare for catching game. (S, Mgh.) You say,
قَطَعَ الظَّبْىُ رِبَاطَهُ [The gazelle rent his snare].
(S.) ―
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  The heart: (K:) as though the body
were tied thereby. (TA.) Hence, (TA in art.
قرض,) قَرَضَ ربَاطَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He died: (M and K in that
art.:) or he was at the point of death. (K in that
art.) And جَآءَ فُلَانٌ وَقَدْ قَرَضَ رِبَاطَهُ (tropical:)  Such a one
came having turned away, or back, harassed, distressed, or fatigued, (S, TA, and AZ and Az in
art. قرض,) and at the point of death: (AZ, Az:)
or harassed, or distressed, by thirst, or by fatigue:
(A in art. قرض:) or in a state of intense thirst
and hunger. (M in that art.) ―
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  The spirit:
as in the saying of El-'Ajjáj, describing a wild
bull,
فَبَاتَ وَهْوَ ثَابِتُ الرِّبَاطِ
[And he passed the night firm in spirit]. (TA.)

in three places.
-A3-  A single building of those
which are called رِبَاطَاتٌ: (S, K:) [a public
building for the accommodation of travellers and
their beasts; (see بَرِيدٌ;) an application well
known, and mentioned in the TK:] a religious
house, or house inhabited by devotees; a dwelling for Soofees; (El-Makreezee's “ Khitat ”
ii. 427;) [a hospice, or an asylum for poor
Muslim students and others, like زَاوِيَةٌ;] a building for the poor: in this sense post-classical: pl.,
accord. to analogy, رُبُطٌ and رِبَاطَاتٌ. (Msb.)
رَبِيطٌ Tied, bound, or made fast; as also ↓ مَرْبُوطٌ;
(K, TA;) applied to a horse, (Mgh,) or similar
beast (دَابَّة); as also ↓ مَرْبُوطَةٌ; (TA;) applied to
the former, i. q. مَرْبُوطٌ; (Mgh;) or مَايُرْتَبَطُ
[which may perhaps signify the same; but more
probably, taken to be tied, or for keeping post, on
the enemy's frontier]; (S;) and [in like manner]
رَبِيطَةٌ, applied to the latter, i. q. مَاارْتُبِطَ: (K:)
and رَبِيطٌ applied to a horse also signifies tied and
fed in the court of a house: (TA:) pl. رُبُطٌ
(TA) and ↓ رِبَاطٌ, (Mgh,) or the latter is a pl. pl.,
being pl. of رُبُطٌ. (TA.) الخَيْلِ ↓ مِنْ رِبَاطِ, in the
Kur [viii. 62], means Of horses that are tied;
(Bd, Mgh;) رِبَاطٌ being of the measure فِعَالٌ in
the sense of the measure مَفْعولٌ; or an inf. n.
used as a subst., being an inf. n. of رَبَطَ in the
sense of رَابَطَ; (Bd;) or it is an inf. n. of رَابَطَ;
and therefore [when used as an epithet, like any
inf. n. so used,] is applied to one as well as to a
pl. number; (Ham p. 222;) or pl. of رَبِيطْ:
(Bd, Mgh:) or it means of mares: (Fr, TA:)
and رِبَاطٌ signifies horses; five thereof, and upwards: (S, K:) or horses, themselves, that are
taken to be tied, or for keeping post, on the
enemy's frontier. (L.) And you say, لِفُلَانٍ
مِنَ الخَيْلِ ↓ رِبَاطٌ Such a one has a stud constituting the source of his horses; like as you say
تلَادٌ. (S.) ↓ رَابطَةٌ, also, applied to horses, signifies Tied in a town or country or the like: occuring in a trad., in which it is said that upon every
horse shall be levied a deenár; but upon the
رابطة, nothing: properly meaning, in this case,
ذَاتُ الرَّبْطِ; being like رَاضِيَةٌ in the phrase عِيشَةٌ
رَاضِيَةٌ. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  See also رَابِطٌ. ―
-b3-  Also, and
↓ رَابِطٌ, (assumed tropical:)  A monk: one who abstains from worldly
pleasures: a sage who restrains himself from
worldly things. (K, TA.) [In the L and TA,
الرَّبِيطُ is also explained, as on the authority of
Ez-Zejjájee, as signifying الذَّاهِبُ; but this I
think a mistranscription, for الرَّاهِبُ.]
-A2-  (assumed tropical:)  Unripe dates soaked [in water]: (S, K:) or (assumed tropical:)  fresh
ripe dates soaked with water; also called مَنْقُوشٌ:
(Sgh, TA in art. نقش:) or (tropical:)  dried dates (A 'Obeyd,
IF, A, K) put into jars (جِرَار), (A 'Obeyd, A,)
and having water poured upon them, (A 'Obeyd,
IF, K,) or moistened with water, in order that
they may become like fresh ripe dates: (A:) but
perhaps this is an adventitious term: (IF:) some
say that it is رَبِيدٌ, and not original. (TA.)
رَبَّاطٌ One who ties bow-strings. (TA.)
رَابِطٌ [act. part. n. of 1]. ―
-b2-  خَلَّفَ فُلَانٌ بِالثَّغْرِ
جَيْشًا رَابِطَةً [Such a one left behind him on the
frontier an army having their horses tied in
preparation for the enemy; or keeping post].
(S.) And بِبَلَدِ كَذَا رَابِطَةٌ مِنَ الخَيْلِ [In such a
town, or country, or the like, is a company of
horsemen having their horses tied at the frontier
in preparation for the enemy; or keeping post on
the frontier: or it may perhaps mean, a number
of horses tied: see رَبِيطٌ]. (S.) ↓ مُرَابِطَةٌ also
signifies A company of warriors; or of men
warring against an enemy: (Mgh:) or a company of men having their horses tied at the
frontier in preparation for the enemy; or keeping post on the frontier; and in like manner
[its pl.] مُرَابِطَاتٌ, a company of horsemen having
their horses tied &c. (TA.) ―

and consequently not doomed, but] having ample
power, or liberty, [and] capable of good; syn.
وَاسِعٌ أَرِيضٌ. (K.) An Arab is related by IAar
to have said, اَللّٰهُمَّ اغْفِرْلِى وَالجِلْدُ بَارِدٌ وَالنَّفْسُ
رَابِطٌ وَالصُّحُفُ مُنْتَشِرَةٌ وَالتَّوْبَةُ مَقْبُولَةٌ [O God, forgive me while the skin is cool, not heated by
fever, and the spirit is yet attached to my body,
and is at liberty, and capable of good, and the
volumes in which my actions are registered are
still expanded, and repentance is accepted]: he
meant thereby, while he was in health; before
death. (TA.) ―
-b5-  See also رَبِيطٌ, in two places.
رَابِطَةٌ [fem. of رَابِطٌ. ―
-b2-  Also] A tie, or connection, of any kind; syn. عُلْقَةٌ [q. v.] and وُصْلَةٌ.

(assumed tropical:)  The copula in a proposition.]
مَرْبِطٌ (S, Mgh, K) and مَرْبَطٌ, (S K,) the former
used by him who says أَرْبُطُ, and the latter by him

(S,) or where a beast, (Mgh, K,) is tied, bound,
or made fast: (S, Mgh, K:) a stable: pl. مَرَابِطُ.
(Har p. 33.) You say, لَيْسَ لَهُ مَرْبَِطُ عَنْزٍ [He has
not so much as, or even, a place where a she-goat is tied]. (S.) Each is a noun of place used
in a definite manner; so that you may not say,
هُوَ مِنِّى مَرْبَطَ الفَرَسِ, like مَنَاطَ الثُّرَيَّا. (TA: [in
which, however, the word مناط has been inadvertently omitted.]) ―
-b2-  [Also A place where
soldiers tie their horses at the frontier in preparation for the enemy; or where they keep post
