رجو1
رَجَوْتُهُ, aor. أَرْجُوهُ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. رَجْوٌ,
(S, M, K,) or رُجُوٌّ, (Msb,) and رَجَآءٌ, (S, K, TA,
&c., [in the CK erroneously written with the
short ا i. e., without the meddeh and ء,]) or the
latter is a simple subst., (Msb,) and رَجَاوَةٌ (S, K)
and رَجَاةٌ, or رَجَآءَةٌ, (accord. to different copies of
the K,) or both, (CK,) and مَرْجَاةٌ; (K;) and
↓ رَجَّيْتُهُ, (S,) inf. n. تَرْجِيَةٌ; (K;) and ↓ تَرَجَّيْتُهُ,
(S, K, *) and ↓ اِرْتَجَيْتُهُ; (S, Msb, K; *) I hoped
for him [or it; relating only to what is possible;
syn. with أَمَلْتُهُ; see رَجَآءٌ, below]; all signify the
same: (S:) and رَجَيْتُهُ, aor. أَرْجِيهِ, is a dial. var.
of رَجَوْتُهُ: (Msb:) and رَجِيَهُ, aor. يَرْجَاهُ, like
رَضِيَهُ, is a dial. var. of رَجَاهُ, aor. يَرْجُوهُ, accord.
to Lth: it is disapproved by Az, because heard
by him on no other authority than that of Lth;
but it is mentioned also by ISd. (TA.) One
says, مَا أَتَيْتُكَ إِلَّا رَجَاوَةَ الخَيْرِ [I did not, or have
not, come to thee except hoping for that which is
good]. (S.) No regard is to be paid to the assertion of Lth, that the saying فَعَلْتُ رَجَاةَ كَذَا [I
did a thing hoping for such a thing] is a mistake,
and that the correct word is only رَجَآءَ; for رَجَاةٌ
occurs in a trad., and in the poetry of the Arabs.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Sometimes رَجْوٌ, (S,) or رُجُوٌّ, (Msb,)
has the meaning of خَوْفٌ; (S, Msb;) because
the hoper fears that he may not attain the thing
for which he hopes; (Msb;) and so رَجَآءٌ; (T, S;)
but only when there is with it a negative particle:
(Fr, T, TA:) you say, مَا رَجَوْتُكَ (assumed tropical:)  I feared not
thee: but you do not say, رَجَوْتُكَ, meaning I
feared thee: (TA:) the saying in the Kur [lxxi.
12], مَا لَكُمْ لَا تَرْجُونَ لِلّٰهِ وَقَارًا means (assumed tropical:)  [What
aileth you] that ye will not fear the greatness, or
majesty, of God? (S:) or the meaning is, that
ye will not hope for God's magnifying of him
who serves Him and obeys Him? or that ye will
not believe in greatness, or majesty, belonging to
God, so that ye may fear disobeying Him?
(Bd:) another instance occurs in a verse of Aboo-Dhu-eyb, cited in art. خلف, conj. 3: (S:) and
↓ ارتجاهُ, also, signifies (tropical:)  he feared him, or it;
[but app. only when preceded by a negative
particle, as in exs. cited in the TA;] (K, TA;)
in which sense it is tropical. (TA.) Accord. to
Lth, رَجْوٌ is also syn. with مُبَالَاةٌ; and مَا أَرْجُو
means مَا أُبَالِى [I do not care, mind, or heed]:
but this is disapproved by Az. (TA.)
-A2-  رَجِىَ
He broke off, or ceased, [app. by reason of inability,] from speaking: (K:) or, accord. to Az,
he became confounded, or perplexed, and unable
to see his right course: or, as Fr says, he desired
to speak, and was unable to do so: (TA:) and
رُجِىَ عَلَيْهِ, like عُنِىَ, he became unable to speak.
(K.)

رَجَّوَ see 1, first sentence.
4
أَرْجَتْ She (a camel, S, or a pregnant female
[of any kind], TA) was, or became, near to
bringing forth; (S, K, TA;) so that her bringing
forth was hoped for: accord. to Er-Rághib, the
proper signification is she made her owner to have
hope in himself that her bringing forth was near:
(TA:) and أَرْجَأَتْ means the same. (S.) ―
-b2-
ارجى الصَّيْدَ He failed of getting any game;
(K;) [as though he made the game to have
hope;] and ارجأهُ signifies the same: (TA:) or
so ارجى [alone], and ارجأ [alone]. (K and TA
in art. رجأ.)
-A2-  And أَرْجَيْتُهُ, (S, Msb,) inf. n.
إِرْجَآءٌ, (K,) I postponed it, put it off, deferred it,
or delayed it; (S, Msb, K; *) namely, an affair
[&c.]; (S;) as also ارجأتهُ. (S, Msb.) [See the
latter verb: and see also an ex. in the Kur vii.
108 and xxvi. 35; and the various readings
mentioned by Bd in the former instance.]
-A3-
ارجى البِئْرَ He made a side (رَجًا) to the well.
(S, K.)

تَرَجَّوَ see 1, first sentence. ―
-b2-  [In the present day,
ترجّى is often used as meaning He besought, entreated, petitioned, or prayed.]
8
إِرْتَجَوَ see 1, first sentence: ―
-b2-  and again in the
latter part of the paragraph.
رَجًا The side, (K,) in a general sense: (TA:)
or the side of a well, (S, Msb, K,) and of the
sky, (Er-Rághib, TA,) and of anything; (S,
Msb; *) and ↓ رَجَآءٌ signifies the same: (K:) the
side of a well from its top to its bottom; (TA;)
and the two sides thereof: which last is also
[or properly] the meaning of the dual; which is
رَجَوَانِ: (S:) pl. أَرْجَآءٌ. (S, Msb, K.) Hence,
in the Kur [lxix. 17], وَالْمَلَكُ عَلَى أَرْجَائِهَا [The
angels being at the sides thereof]. (S, TA.) They
said, رُمِىَ بِهِ الرَّجَوَانِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He was cast
into places of destruction: (S:) or it is said of
one who is held in mean estimation: (M, TA:)
اِسْتِهْزَآءٌ in the K is a mistake for اُسْتُهِينَ بِهِ, the
reading in the M: (TA:) as though the two
[opposite] sides of the well were cast at with
him. (K.) And one says of him who will not
be deceived so as to be turned away from one
course to another, لَا تُرْمَى بِهِ الرَّجَوَانِ (assumed tropical:)  [lit. The
two sides of the well will not be cast at with him];
in allusion to the well's two [opposite] sides' being
cast at with the bucket. (Z, TA.)
رَجَآءٌ [accord. to most an inf. n., (see 1, in two
senses,) but accord. to the Msb a simple subst.,]
Hope; syn. أَمَلٌ; (S and M and K in art امل;)
contr. of يَأْسٌ; (K;) an opinion requiring the
happening of an event in which will be a cause
of happiness; (Er-Rághib, TA;) expectation of
deriving advantage from an event of which a
cause has already occurred: (El-Harállee, TA:)
or, as Ibn-El-Kemál says, properly, i. q. أَمَلٌ:
and conventionally, the clinging of the heart to
the happening of a future loved event: (TA:) or
hope, or eager desire, for a thing that may possibly
happen; differing from تَمَنٍّ, which relates to
what is possible and to what is impossible. (MF,
TA.)
-A2-  See also رَجًا.
رَجِيَّةٌ [A thing hoped for]: you say, مَالَى فِى
فُلَانٍ رَجِيَّةٌ There is nothing for me to hope for in
such a one. (S.)
رَاجٍ [Hoping: ―
-b2-  and Fearing]. (Msb.)
أُرْجِيَّةٌ A thing postponed, put off, deferred, or
delayed. (ISd, K.)
أُرْجُوَانٌ Redness: (Msb, K:) a certain red dye:
(K:) or a certain dye, intensely red: (S:) accord.
to A'Obeyd, (S,) what is called نَشَاسْتَج; (S, K;)
and he says that the بَهْرَمَان is inferior to it (دُونَهُ
[but this often has the contr. meaning]): it is
said also that ارجوان is an arabicized word, from
the Pers. أَرْغَوَان, which means a sort of trees
having a red blossom, of the most beautiful kind;
and that every colour resembling it is termed
ارجوان. (S.) Also Red: (K:) and red garments or clothes. (IAar, K.) And one says أَحْمَرُ
أُرْجُوَانٌ, mentioned by Seer has having an intensive
meaning; (M, TA;) in the K, ↓ أَحْمَرُ أُرْجُوَانِىٌّ;
but this is wrong; (TA;) i. e. Intensely red.
(K, TA.) And قَطِيفَةٌ حَمْرَآءُ أُرْجُوَانٌ [A villous,
or nappy, outer, or wrapping, garment, intensely
red]: (S, M, A:) but IAth says that the most
common practice is to prefix the word ثَوْب or قَطِيفَة
to أُرْجُوَان so as to govern the latter in the gen.
case; [saying ثَوْبُ أُرْجُوَانٍ or قَطِيفَةُ أُرْجُوَانٍ;]
and that the word [ارجوان] is said by some to be
Arabic, the ا and ن being augmentative. (TA.)
أُرْجُوَانِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.
[
مُرْجًى Postponed, put off, deferred, or delayed;
as also مُرْجَأٌ.] Some read [in the Kur ix. 107]
وَآخَرُونَ مُرْجَوْنَ لِأَمْرِ اللّٰهِ. (S: see مرجأ, in art.
رجأ.)
[
مُرْجٍ and مُرْجِيَةٌ and] مُرْجِىءٌ and مُرْجِءَةٌ A
female near to bringing forth. (K, * TA.)
-A2-
مُرْجٍ also signifies A man who is one of the people
[or sect] called the مُرْجِيَة; (S;) or one of the
مُرْجِئَة, mentioned in art. رجأ; as also مُرْجِىءٌ; and
so ↓ مُرْجِىٌّ; (K;) or this is [properly speaking]
a rel. n. from مُرْجٍ; (S;) and مُرْجِئِىٌّ also; (K;)
or rather this is another rel. n., like مُرْجِىٌّ. (IB
and TA in art. رجأ, q. v.)
مُرْجِى: see what next precedes. You say رَجُلٌ
مُرْجِىٌّ [A man of, or belonging to, the sect called
the مُرْجِيَة]. (S.)
