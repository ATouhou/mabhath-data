رجم1
رَجْمٌ signifies The throwing, or casting, of
stones: (S, K:) this is its primary meaning:
(S, TA:) you say, رَجَمَهُ, aor.
رَجُمَ, inf. n. رَجْمٌ,
(S, Msb, TA,) He threw, or cast, stones at him;
or pelted him with stones: (S, TA:) or he struck
him, or smote him, with رَجَم, meaning stones:
(Msb:) and رُجُومٌ is syn. with رَجْمٌ, as an inf. n.:
thus some explain the saying, in the Kur [lxvii. 5],
وَجْعَلْنَاهَا رُجُومًا لِلشَّيَاطِينِ [And we have made
them for casting at the devils; meaning shooting
stars, which are believed to be hurled at the devils
that listen by stealth, beneath the lowest heaven,
to the words of the angels therein: but see other
explanations below, voce رَجْمٌ]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence,
(S, TA,) The act of slaying [in any manner, but
generally stoning, i. e. putting to death by stoning].
(S, K.) So in رَجْمُ الثَّيِّبَيْنِ إِذَا زَنَيَا [The slaying,
or stoning, of the two married persons when they
have committed adultery]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [(assumed tropical:)  The act
of beating, or battering, the ground with the feet.]
One says of a camel, يَرْجُمُ الأَرْضَ (assumed tropical:)  [He beats, or
batters, the ground], i. e., with his feet; which
implies commendation: (TA:) and so one says
of a horse; (K;) or يُرْجُمُ فِى الأَرْضِ. (S.) And
one says also, جَآءَ يَرْجُمُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [He came
beating, or battering, the ground; or] passing
along with an ardent and a rapid running. (Lh,
K, * TA.) [See also 8.] ―
-b4-  (tropical:)  The act of cursing.
(K, TA.) ―
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  The act of reviling. (K, TA.)
لَأَرْجُمَنَّكَ, in the Kur xix. 47, means (assumed tropical:)  I will
assuredly revile thee: (Bd, Jel, TA: see also
another explanation below, in this paragraph:)
or I will assuredly cast stones at thee, (Bd, Jel,)
so that thou shalt die, or shalt remove far from
me. (Bd.) And you say, رَجَمْتُهُ بِالقَوْلِ, meaning
(assumed tropical:)  I uttered foul, or evil, speech against him.
(Msb.) [See also رَجَبَهُ.] ―
-b6-  (assumed tropical:)  The act of driving
away; expelling; putting, or placing, at a distance, away, or far away. (K.) ―
-b7-  (assumed tropical:)  The act of
cutting off from friendly, or loving communion
or intercourse; forsaking; or abandoning. (K.)
―
-b8-  Also [as being likened to the throwing of
stones, in doing which one is not sure of hitting
the mark,] i. q. قَذْفٌ (K, TA) بِالغَيْبِ
(assumed tropical:)  [The act of speaking of that which is hidden, or
which has not become apparent to the speaker;
and conjecturing]; (TA;) or speaking conjecturally: (S, TA:) and (K, TA) some say (TA)
i. q. غَيْبٌ [as meaning (assumed tropical:)  a doubting]: (K, TA:
[in the CK, العَيْبُ is erroneously put for الغَيْبُ:]
and ظَنٌّ [which means (assumed tropical:)  an opining, or a conjecturing]. (K, TA.) One says, رَجَمَ بِالغَيْبِ (assumed tropical:)  He
spoke of that which he did not know. (Ham
p. 494.) And رَجَمَ بِالظَّنِّ (Z, TA) (assumed tropical:)  He spoke
conjecturally: (MA:) or he conjectured, or
opined. (Bd in xviii. 21.) Hence, قَالَهُ رَجْمًا
(assumed tropical:)  He said it conjecturally. (Z, TA.) Hence also,
(TA,) رَجْمًا بَالغَيْبِ, in the Kur [xviii. 21], (S,
TA,) (assumed tropical:)  [Speaking conjecturally of that which is
hidden, or unknown; as indicated in the S and
TA: or] conjecturing in a case hidden from them.
(Jel.) One says also, قَالَ رَجْمًا بِالغَيْبِ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He
said conjecturally, [or speaking of that which
was hidden from him, or unknown by him,] without evidence, and without proof. (Msb.) And
صَارَ رَجْمًا لَا يُوقَفُ عَلَى حَقِيقَةِ أَمْرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [It became
a subject of conjecture, the real state of the case
whereof one was not to be made to know]. (S,
TA.) And لَأَرْجُمَنَّكَ, in the Kur [xix. 47, of
which two explanations have been mentioned
above], means [accord. to some] I will assuredly
say of thee, [though] speaking of that which is
hidden [from me], or unknown [by me], what
thou dislikest, or hatest. (TA.) ―
-b9-  لِسَانٌ يُرْجُمُ
[if the latter word be not a mistranscription for
↓ مِرْجَمٌ, q. v.,] means A tongue that is chaste, or
perspicuous, and copious, in speech. (Msb in art.
ترجم.) ―
-b10-  See also the next paragraph, in three
places.

رجّم القَبْرَ, inf. n. تَرْجِيمٌ, He placed upon the
grave رُجَم [meaning large stones, to make a

trad. of 'Abd-Allah Ibn-Mughaffal, that he said,
لَا تُرَجِّمُوا قَبْرِى, i. e. Place not ye upon my grave
رُجَم; meaning thereby that they should make his
grave even with the ground, not gibbous and
elevated: the verb is thus correctly, with tesh-deed: but the relaters of trads. say, ↓ لا تَرْجُمُوا
قبرى: (S:) [and it is said that] القَبْرَ ↓ رَجَمَ, (K,
TA,) aor.
رَجُمَ, inf. n. رَجْمٌ, (TA,) signifies عَلَّمَهُ,

i. e. say not, at it, what is unseemly; from الرَّجْمُ
signifying “ the act of reviling. ” (TA.)
