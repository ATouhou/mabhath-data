رشد1
رَشَدَ, aor.
رَشُدَ; and رَشِدَ, aor.
رَشَدَ; (S, A, L,
Msb, K;) the former of which is the better known
and the more chaste; (TA;) inf. n. رُشْدٌ, (S, L,
Msb, K,) which is of the former, (S, L,) and
رَشَدٌ, (S, L, Msb, K,) which is of the latter, (S,
L, Msb,) and رَشَادٌ, (L, K,) which is also of the
latter verb, (TA,) or this last is a simple subst.;
(Msb;) He took, or followed, a right way or
course or direction; (S, A, L, Msb, K;) as to a
road, and also as to an affair: (L:) [and often
relating to religion; meaning he held a right
belief; was orthodox:] and ↓ استرشد signifies the
same: (L, K:) you say, استرشد لِأَمْرِهِ, meaning
He took, or followed, a right way to conduct his
affair: and رَشَدَ أَمْرَهُ, meaning He took, or followed, a right course in his affair; this latter
being a phrase similar to أَلِمَ بَطْنَهُ and سَفِهَ رَأْيَهُ
&c. (L.) Some say that رَشْدٌ relates to the things
of the present life and to those of the life to come;
and رَشَدٌ, only to those of the life to come: but
this distinction does not accord with what has
been heard from the Arabs, nor with readings of
the Kur-án, in which some read رُشْد and others
رَشَد in several verses. (MF.) The former also
signifies The continuing in the way of truth, or
the right way, with self-constraining firmness in
so doing. (K.) One says to the traveller, رَشِدْتَ
[Mayest thou take, or follow, the right way].
