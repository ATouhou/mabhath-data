from the chin [is not requisite, or necessary, or
incumbent]. (Mgh.)
-A2-  [Golius says, as on the
authority of the KL, that رَسَلَ signifies Nuncium
misit: but what I find in the KL is, that رَسُولٌ,
as an inf. n., signifies the bringing a message
(پيغام بردن) : whence it seems that رَسَلَ means he
brought a message.]

فِى كَلَامِهِ تَرْسِيلٌ i. e. تَرْتِيلٌ [There was in his
(Mohammad's) speech an easy, or a leisurely,
utterance]. (TA.) And in another trad. it is said,

الكَافِرِينَ تَؤُزُّهُمْ أَزًّا, i. e. [We have made the devils
to have dominion, &c., over the unbelievers, inciting them strongly to acts of disobedience; or]

said in the same [xliii. 35], نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَانًا [“ We
will appoint, or prepare, for him a devil ” as an
associate]: this is the preferred explanation: [or
it may be well rendered we have sent the devils

said, Send thou to me the camels in droves (أَرْسَالًا
[in the CK, erroneously, اِرْسالًا]); (K, TA;)
ارسالا being with fet-h to the hemzeh; i. e. drove
after drove: for the camels, when they come to the
water, are numerous; and their tender brings
them to the watering-trough thus; not all together, as in this case they would press together
upon the watering-trough and not satisfy their
thirst. (TA.)
رَسْلٌ Easy; applied to a pace. (M, K.) ―
-b2-
Easy in pace; applied to a he-camel: fem. with
ة: (S, M, K:) or soft, or gentle, in pace; applied
to a he-camel and to a she-camel: (Msb:) and
↓ مِرْسَالٌ, also, applied to a she-camel, has the
former of these significations; and its pl. is مَرَاسِيلُ:
(S, K:) or this pl. signifies light, or active, she-camels, that give thee what they have to give
spontaneously; and رَسْلَةٌ is applied to one thereof:
a she-camel is termed ↓ مِرْسَالٌ as being likened to
the arrow thus called. (TA.) ―

or flaccid: [app. applied to a he-camel; for it is
added,] one says نَاقَةٌ رَسْلَةٌ القَوَائِمِ, meaning A

the joints [thereof]. (TA. [See also another
meaning assigned to this phrase in what follows.])

استرسل in the S and K:]) or lank and pendent:
(Msb:) or long, and lank or pendent. (AZ, Az,
Msb.) ―
-b5-  And رَسْلَةٌ, (M,) or رَسْلَةُ القَوائِمِ, [of
which see an explanation in what precedes,] (L,
TA,) and ↓ مِرْسَالٌ, applied to a she-camel, (M,
L, TA,) Having much hair, (M,) or much and
long hair, (L, TA,) upon her shanks, or hind
legs (فِى سَاقِيْهَا): (M, L, TA:) but in the K, رَسْلَةٌ
and ↓ مُرَاسِلٌ [not مِرْسَالٌ] are explained as epithets
applied to a woman, meaning having much and
long hair upon her shanks. (TA.) ―
-b6-  Also sing.
of ↓ رِسَالٌ, (TA,) which signifies The legs of a
camel: (AZ, S, K, TA:) so called because of
their length. (AZ, TA.)
-A2-  See also مُرَاسِلٌ.
-A3-
And see the paragraph here next following.
رِسْلٌ Gentleness; and a deliberate, or leisurely,
manner of acting or behaving; as also ↓ رِسْلَةٌ;
(M, K;) [and perhaps ↓ رَسْلٌ and ↓ رَسْلَةٌ; for]
one says اِفْعَلْ كَذَا وَكَذَا عَلَى رِسْلِكَ (S, Mgh, *
Msb, * CK * [but not in my MS. copy of the K
nor in the copies used by SM]) and رَسْلِكَ and
رَسْلَتِكَ, (CK, [but likewise wanting in MS. copies
of the K,]) i. e. [Do thou such and such things]
at thine ease; (Msb;) or act thou gently, deliberately, or leisurely, (S, Mgh, K, *) in doing
such and such things; like as one says, عَلَى هِينَتِكَ.
(S.) Sakhr-el-Ghei says, when despairing of his
companions' overtaking him, his enemies surrounding him, and he feeling sure of slaughter,
(M,)
لَوْ أَنَّ حَوْلِى مِنْ قُرَيْمٍ رَجْلَا
بِيضَ الوَجُوهِ يَحْمِلُونَ النَّبْلَا
لَمَنَعُونِى نَجْدَةً أَوْ رِسْلَا
(Skr, M, *) i. e. [If there were around me, of the
family of Kureym, men on foot, fair in the faces
(app. meant tropically), bearing arrows, they
would defend me] by violent means or by gentle
means: (Skr:) or with fighting or without fighting. (M.) [See also a phrase cited from a trad.
in what follows of this paragraph.] One says
also, ↓ جَاؤُوا رِسْلَةً رِسْلَةً They came company by
company. (M.) ―
-b2-  And A soft, gentle, saying or
speech. (TA.)
-A2-  Also Milk, (S, M, K,) of
whatever sort it be: (M, K:) or, accord. to the
Towsheeh, fresh milk. (TA.) One says, كَثُرَ
الرِّسْلُ العَامَ, meaning Milk has become abundant
this year: and the people of the desert assert that,
when this is the case, dates are few; and that,
when dates are abundant, milk is scarce. (TA.)
―
-b2-  It is said in a trad. [respecting the giving of
the poor-rate], إِلَّا مَنْ أَعْطَى فِى نَجْدَتِهَا وَرِسْلِهَا,
(S, TA,) which is explained in two different
ways: (TA:) [J says that] it is from رِسْلٌ in the
sense first explained above; meaning straitness
and plenty; i. e. Except him who gives when they
are fat and goodly, when it is difficult, or hard,
to their owner to give them forth, and when they
are lean, [or] in a middling condition: (S:) and
A'Obeyd says the like; and that it is similar to
the saying, قَالَ فُلَانٌ كَذَا عَمَّا رِسْلِهِ, meaning
Such a one said such a thing holding it (the
saying) in light estimation: others say that it is
from رِسْلٌ signifying “ milk; ” which A'Obeyd
disallows: IAth says that what is meant by نجدة
is straitness and drought or barrenness or dearth;
and by رسل, plenty, and abundance of herbage or
the like; because رسل, i. e. milk, is plentiful only
in the case of abundance of herbage; so that the
meaning is, except him who gives forth the due
of God in the case of straitness and in that of
plenty. (TA.)
-A3-  The رِسْلَانِ of a horse are The
extremities of the عَضُدَانِ [or two arms].
(M, K. *)
رَسَلٌ Camels: (M, K:) thus expl. by A'Obeyd,
without any epithet: (M:) or a drove, or herd,
or a distinct collection or number, of camels, (S,
M, * Msb, K,) and of sheep or goats, (S, K,)
accord. to ISk from ten to twenty-five, (TA,) or
the رَسَل of the watering-trough is at least ten,
and extending to twenty-five; and the word is
masc. and fem.; (M;) and also (assumed tropical:)  of horses or
horsemen; (S;) applied to (tropical:)  a company of men
(Mgh, Msb) as being likened to a drove, or herd,
of camels: (Msb:) and also a distinct collection
or number of any things: (M, K:) pl. أَرْسَالٌ.
(S, M, Mgh, Msb, K.) A rájiz says,
يَا ذَائِدَيْهَا خَوِّصَا بِأَرْسَالْ
وَلَا تَذُودَاهَا ذِيَادَ الضُّلَّالْ
[O ye two drivers of them, water some before
others, by droves, and drive them not with the
driving of those who err from the right way]:
(S, TA:) i. e. bring near your camels some after
some, and do not let them crowd upon the water-ing-trough. (TA.) And one says, جَآءَتِ الإِبِلُ رَسَلًا
The camels came [in a drove, or] following one
another. (IAmb, TA.) And جَآءَتِ الخَيْلُ أَرْسَالًا,
i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [The horses, or horsemen, came] in successive
distinct companies. (S, TA.) And جَاءُوا أَرْسَالًا
(tropical:)  They (men) came in successive companies.
(Msb. [And the like is said in the Mgh and in
the TA.]) وَقِيرٌ كَثِيرُ الرَّسَلِ قَلِيلُ الرِّسْلِ, occurring
in a trad. relating to a drought, is said by IKt to
mean [A collection of sheep or goats] of which
many were sent to the pasture, i. e. many in number, but having little milk but the more probable
explanation of كثير الرسل is that of El-'Odhree,
who says that it means much dispersed in search
of pasture: for the trad. relates that the camels
had died, notwithstanding their ability to endure
drought: how then should the sheep or goats be
safe, and increase so as to become numerous?
(IAth, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also Animals, or beasts, having
milk. (M, TA.)
رُسُلٌ A young girl, that has not worn the
[muffler, or veil, called] خَمَار. (K.)
-A2-  Also a pl.
of رَسُولٌ. (S, M, &c.)
رَسْلَةٌ A soft, or delicate condition of life: you
say, هُمْ فِى رَسْلَةٍ مِنَ العَيْشِ They are in a soft,
or delicate, condition of life. (M.) ―
-b2-  And
Heaviness, sluggishness, laziness, or indolence:
(M, K:) you say رَجُلٌ فِيهِ رَسْلَةٌ A man in whom
is heaviness, &c. (M.) ―
-b3-  See also رِسْلٌ, first
sentence.
رِسْلَةٌ: see رِسْلٌ, in two places.
رِسَالٌ: see رَسْلٌ (of which it is the pl.), near the
end of the paragraph:
-A2-  and see also مُرَاسِلٌ.
رَسُولٌ i. q. رِسَالَةٌ: (S, M, K:) see the latter, in
five places. ―
-b2-  Hence, as meaning ذُو رَسُولٍ, i. e.
ذُو رِسَالَةٍ [One who has a message; i. e. a messenger]; (TA;) i. q. ↓ مُرْسَلٌ, (S, M, K,) meaning
one sent with a message; (S;) of the measure
فَعُولٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ [or rather
مُفْعَلٌ]: (Msb:) [and often meaning an apostle
of God; and with the article ال especially applied
to Mohammad:] accord. to IAmb, its meaning
in the proper language of the Arabs is one who
carries on by consecutive progressions the relation
of the tidings of him who has sent him; taken
from the phrase جَآءَتِ الإِبِلُ رَسَلًا, meaning “ The
camels came following one another: ” and the
saying of the Muëdhdhin, أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللّٰه
means I know [or acknowledge] and declare that
Mohammad is the relater by consecutive progressions of the tidings from God: (TA:) [or,
as commonly understood, I testify that Mohammad is the apostle of God:] a رَسُول is also called
↓ مِرْسَالٌ, as being likened to the arrow thus
termed: (TA:) the pl. of رَسُولٌ is رُسُلٌ (S, M,
Msb, K) and رُسْلٌ (S, Msb) and رُسَلَآءٌ, (M, K,)
which last is from IAar, (M,) or Fr, (Sgh,) and
أَرْسُلٌ, (M, K,) which [is a pl. of pauc., and]
occurs in the saying of the Hudhalee,
لَوْكَانَ فِى قَلْبِى كَقَدْرِ قُلَامَةٍ
حُبًا لِغَيْرِكِ قَدْ أَتَاهَا أَرْسُلِى
[Had there been in my heart as much as a nailparing of love for another than thee, my messengers (or, accord. to the TA, app., my messages)
had come to her]: respecting which IJ says that
he has given to رَسُولٌ this form of pl., which is
[regularly] proper to feminines [of this class of
words, consisting of four letter whereof the third
is a letter of prolongation], such as أَتَانٌ and
عَنَاقٌ and عُقَابٌ, because women are meant thereby, as they, generally, are the persons required
to serve in cases of this kind: (M:) [for] رَسُولٌ
is applied without variation to a male and a
female, and to one [and to two] and to a pl.
number; (S, M, Msb, K;) sometimes: (M:)
i. e., it is allowable thus to apply it: (Msb:)
hence, (S, K,) in the Kur [xxvi. 15], (S,) إِنَّا
رَسُولُ رَبِّ العَالَمِينَ [Verily we are the apostles of
the Lord of the beings of the whole world]: (S,
K:) MF says, in ch. xx. [verse 49], we find
إِنَّا رَسُولَا رَبِّكَ [Verily we are the two apostles of
thy Lord]; the dual form being here used: and
Z says, in the Ksh, that in this instance it means
the messengers, and therefore the dual form is
necessarily used; but in ch. xxvi. it means the
message, and therefore it is allowable to use it
alike, when applying it as an epithet, as sing.
and dual and pl.: Aboo-Is-hak the Grammarian
says that the meaning here is, إِنَّا رِسَالَةٌ رَبِّ العَالَمِينَ,
i. e. ذَوُو رِسالَةِ [Verily we are those that have the
message &c.]: (TA:) [but] رَسُولٌ [as meaning a
messenger] is like عَدُوٌّ and صَديقٌ [&c.] in its
being used alike as masc. and fem. and sing. [and
dual] and pl.: (Sgh, TA:) Aboo-Dhu-eyb uses
it in the sense of رُسُل in his saying,
أَلِكْنِى إِلَيْهَا وَخَيْرُ الرَّسُو
لِ أَعْلَمُهُمْ بِنَوَاحِى الخَبَرْ
[Be thou my messenger to her: and the best of
messengers is the most knowing of them in respect
of the bounds, or limits, of the tidings]. (M.)
See 4. The saying in the Kur [xxv. 39], وَقَوْمَ
نُوحٍ لَمَّ كَذَّبُوا الرُّسُلَ أَغْرَقْنَاهُمْ [lit. And the
people of Noah, when they charged with lying
the apostles, we drowned them], Zj says, may
mean that they charged with lying Noah alone;
for he who charges with lying a prophet charges
therewith all the prophets, since they believe in
God and in all his apostles; or the general term
may be here used as meaning one; like as when
you say, أَنْتَ مِمَّنْ يُنْفِقُ الدَّرَاهِمَ, meaning “ Thou
art of those who expend the kind of things
termed دراهم. ” (M.) ―
-b3-  One says also, السِّهَامُ
رُسُلُ المَنَايَا (tropical:)  [Arrows are the messengers of death,
or of the decrees of death]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  See also
the next paragraph.
رَسِيلٌ Easy: occurring in the saying of Jubeyhà El-Asadee,
وَقُمْتُ رَسِيلًا بِالَّذِى جَآءَ يَبْتَغِى
