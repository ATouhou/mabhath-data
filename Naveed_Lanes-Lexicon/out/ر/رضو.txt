رضو1
رَضِىَ is originally رَضِوَ; the و being changed
into ى because of the kesreh: (S:) the tribe of
Teiyi said رَضَا for رَضِىَ. (IDrd in his lex., cited
by Freytag; and Mughnee voce إِلَى there said to
be a dial. var. of رَضِىَ.) You say, رَضِىَ عَنْهُ, (S,
M, Msb, K,) and عَلَيْهِ, (M, Msb, K,) which is of
the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, (Msb,) the
verb being thus made trans. by means of على,
accord. to Ks, agreeably with the opinion of Sb
respecting instances of this kind, for the purpose
of making it to accord with its contr., سَخِطَ,
(M, TA,) aor. يَرْضَى, (K,) inf. n. رِضًى (S, M,
Msb, K) and رُضًى (M, K) and رِضْوَانٌ and رُضْوَانٌ,
(S, * M, Msb, * K,) the last of the dial. of Keys
and Temeem, (Msb, TA,) and mentioned by Sb,
(M, TA,) but all the readers of the Kur read
رضوان with kesr, except 'Ásim, who is related
to have read it with damm, (T, TA,) and مَرْضَاةٌ,
(S, * M, K,) originally مَرْضَوَةٌ, (TA,) He was
pleased, well pleased, content, contented, or satisfied, with him; regarded him with good will, or
favour; or liked, or approved, him; (MA;)
[i. e., as said above,] contr. of سَخِطَ; (M, Msb,
K;) the object being a person: (Msb:) and Sb
states that they also said رَضْيُوا, with the medial
radical quiescent, for رَضُوا; but it is extr. (M,
TA.) The saying in the Kur [v. last verse but
one, and ix. 101, &c.] رَضِىَ اللّٰهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ
[God is well pleased with them and they are well
pleased with Him] means God is well pleased
with their deeds and they are well pleased with
the recompense that He has bestowed upon them:
(M, TA:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib, رِضَى العَبْدِ
عَنِ اللّٰهِ means The servant's, or man's, being not
displeased with that which God's decree has made
to happen to him; and رِضَى اللّٰهِ عِنِ العَبْدِ, God's
seeing the servant, or man, to be obedient to that
which He has commanded, and refraining from
that which He has forbidden. (TA.) You say
also, رَضِيتُهُ, (S, Msb, K,) and رَضِيتُ بِهِ, (M,
Msb,) inf. n. رِضًى (Msb, TA) [and رُضًى and
رِضْوَانٌ &c., as above]; and ↓ اِرْتَضَيْتُهُ; (S, Msb;)
I was pleased, well pleased, content, contented, or
satisfied, with it; regarded it with good will, or
favour; or liked, or approved, it: (MA: [for the
verb is there said to have the same signification
in the phrases رَضِيَهُ and رَضِىَ بِهِ as it has in رَضِىَ
عَنْهُ and عَلَيْهِ; and ارتضاه is there similarly explained: and the like is implied in the S and K;
and is evidently agreeable with general usage:])
or he chose it, or preferred it: (Msb, TA:)
the object being a thing: (S, Msb, TA:) or
(accord. to explanations of تَرْضَاهَا in the Kur
ii. 139) I loved it, or liked it; (Ksh, Bd, Jel;)
inclined to it; (Ksh;) had a desire for it. (Bd.)
The saying of the lawyers, [respecting a woman
whose consent to her marriage has been asked,]
يَشْهَدُ عَلَى رِضَاهَا means It [i. e. her silence]
testifies, or declares, her permission [or consent];
because permission indicates رِضًى. (Msb.) You
say also, رَضِيتُ بِهِ صَاحِبًا [I was pleased with him,
or I liked him, or approved him, or chose him,
or preferred him, as a companion]. (S.) And
رَضِيَهُ لِذٰلِكَ الأَمْرِ, and ↓ ارتضاهُ, [which may be well
rendered He approved him for that thing, or
affair,] meaning he saw him, or judged him, to
be fit for that thing, or affair. (M.) And
لِصُحْبَتِهِ وَخِدْمَتِهِ ↓ ارتضاهُ (K, TA) He [approved
him, or] chose him, or preferred him; and saw
him, or judged him, to be fit; for his companionship, and his service. (TA.) And رُضِيَتْ مَعيشَتُهُ
[His living, or sustenance, was found pleasing,
well pleasing, contenting, or satisfying; or was
liked, or approved]: one should not say رَضِيَتة [in
this case]. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  رَضَوْتُهُ, (S, M, K,) aor.
أَرْضُوهُ, (S, K,) signifies I surpassed him in رِضًى
[i. e. in being pleased, well pleased, content, &c.:
see above, second sentence]: (S, * M, K *:) so in
the saying, فَرَضَوْتُهُ ↓ رَاضَانِى [He vied, or contended, with me in being pleased, well pleased,
content, &c., and I surpassed him therein]: (S,
M, K:) the inf. n. of راضانى thus used is مُرَاضَاةٌ
and رِضَآءٌ; (M;) both these signify the same (K,
TA) as inf. ns. of this verb. (TA.)

رَضَّوَ see 4.

رَاْضَوَ see 1, last sentence. ―
-b2-  راضَيْتُهُ, inf. n. مُرَاضَاةٌ
and رِضَآءٌ, signifies [also] I agreed, consented,
accorded, or was of one mind or opinion, with
him. (Msb.)
4
ارضاهُ, (M, MA, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِرْضَآءٌ, (Msb,)
He, or it, made him to be pleased, well pleased,
content, contented, or satisfied; (MA;) [he, or it,
pleased, contented, or satisfied, him:] or he gave
him that with which he would be pleased, well
pleased, content, contented, or satisfied. (M, K: *
in the former, أَعْطَاهُ مَا يَرْضَى بِهِ: in the latter,
أَعْطَاهُ مَا يُرْضِيهِ.) Hence, in the Kur [ix. 8],
يُرْضُونَكُمْ بِأَفْوَاهِهِمْ وَتَأْبَى قُلُوبُهُمْ [They will please
you, or content you, with their mouths, but
their hearts will be incompliant]. (TA.) And
أَرْضَيْتُهُ عَنِّى, and ↓ رَضَّيْتُهُ with teshdeed, [I made
him to be pleased, well pleased, content, &c., with
me,] فَرَضِىَ [and he was pleased, &c.]. (S.)
5
ترضّاهُ He sought to please, content, or
satisfy, him; (M, K;) as also ↓ استرضاهُ. (K.)
A poet says,
إِذَا العَجُوزُ غَضِبَتْ فَطَلِّقْ
وَلَا تَرَضَّاهَا وَلَا تَمَلَّقْ
[When the old woman is angry, then divorce thou;
and seek not to please, or content, her, nor behave
in a loving, or blandishing, or coaxing, manner]:
he says تَرَضَّاهَا instead of تَرَضَّهَا to avoid what is
termed خَبْنٌ; but some relate it in the manner
better known, saying وَلَا تَرَضَّهَا. (M.) ―
-b2-  [Also]
تَرَضَّيْتُهُ I pleased, contented, or satisfied, him
(أَرْضَيْتُهُ) after striving, labouring, or toiling. (S.)
6
تَرَاضَيَاهُ [They two agreed, consented, accorded, or were of one mind or opinion, respecting
it; or were pleased, well pleased, content, contented, or satisfied, with it; they both liked it, or
approved it]: (A, K:) and تَرَاضَيَا بِهِ [signifies the
same]. (Bd in iv. 28.) And تَرَاضَوْهُ بَيْنَهُمْ They
agreed among themselves in being pleased, contented, or satisfied, with it; or in liking, or
approving, it. (MA.) إِذَا تَرَاضَوْا بَيْنَهُمْ, in the
Kur [ii. 232], means [When they agree, or consent, among themselves; or] when they are pleased,
well pleased, content, &c., [among themselves,]
every one of them with his [or her] companion.
(TA.) Hence the trad., إِنَّمَا البَيْعُ عَنْ تَرَاضً [Sel-ling, or buying, is only resultant from mutual
agreement, consent, or content, or approval].
(TA.) And you say, وَقَعَ بِهِ التَّرَاضِى [Mutual
agreement, or consent, to it, or mutual content
with it, or mutual approval of it, happened, or
took place]. (A, K. [In some copies of the K,
by the omission of وَ, this phrase is made to be as
though it were meant as an explanation of
تَرَاضَيَاهُ.])

إِرْتَضَوَ see 1, in three places.
10
استرضاهُ He asked, begged, or petitioned, of
him that he would please, content, or satisfy, him,
or that he would give him that with which he
would be pleased, well pleased, content, contented,
or satisfied. (Z, K.) You say, اِسْتَرْضَيْتُهُ فَأَرْضَانِى
[I asked, begged, or petitioned, of him that he
would please me, &c., and he pleased me, &c.].

رُضًى A certain idol-temple, belonging to [the
tribe of] Rabee'ah: (K:) whence they gave the
name of عَبْدُ رُضًى [Servant of Rudà]. (TA.)
رِضًى is merely an inf. n., (S,) [as such] syn.
with مَرْضَاةٌ, (K,) meaning The being pleased, well
pleased, content, &c.; [see 1;] contr. of سَخَطٌ:
(M:) and the simple subst. is ↓ رِضَآءٌ, with medd.;
[signifying a state of being pleased, &c.;] (Akh,
S;) or the latter is only an inf. n. of 3, (M,) syn.
with مُرَاضَاةٌ: (M, K:) [but] the former [is also
used as a subst., signifying content, or approval:
and permission, or consent: and] is dualized, app.
as meaning the kind [or mode or manner, of being
pleased, &c.]: (M:) the dual is رِضَوَانٍ and رِضَيَانِ:
(S, M, K:) Ks heard رِضَوَانِ and حَمَوَانِ as duals
of رِضًى and حِمًى; and says that the proper way
is to say رِضَيَانِ and حِمَيَانِ, [which in the case of
the former is strange, as its final radical is و,]
but that the pronunciation with و is the more
common: (S:) and accord. to some, مَرَاضٍ is an
irreg. pl. of رِضًى; but others say that it is pl. of
مَرْضَاةٌ. (TA.) You say, مَا فَعَلْتُهُ عِنْ رِضَاهُ and
رِضْوَتِهِ: see the latter, below. (Z, K.) ―
-b2-  See also
رَاضٍ, latter sentence.
-A2-  And رَجُلٌ رِضًى, (M, K,)
and قَوْمٌ رِضًى, (M,) A man, (M, K,) and a
people, or party, (M,) with whom one is pleased,
well pleased, contented, or satisfied; regarded
with good will, or favour; liked, or approved;
syn. مَرْضِىٌّ (M, K) and قُنْعَانٌ: رِضًى being, thus
used, an inf. n. in the sense of a pass. part. n.,
like as the inf. n. is used in the sense of an act.
part. n. in the instance of عَدْلٌ, and خَصْمٌ. (M.)
―
-b2-  [See also رَضِىٌّ; for which رِضًى or رِضًا seems
to be erroneously substituted, in two senses, in
some copies of the K.]
رَضٍ: see رَاضٍ.
مَا فَعَلْتُهُ عَنْ رِضْوَتِهِ means ↓ عَنْ رِضَاهُ [i. e. I
did it not of, or with, his pleasure, good pleasure,
content, or approval]. (Z, K.)
رِضْوَانٌ an inf. n. of رَضِىَ; like رُضْوَانٌ. (M, K,
&c.)
-A2-  Also The treasurer, keeper, or guardian,
of Paradise. (MA, K.)
رِضَآءٌ: see رِضًى, first sentence.
رَضِىٌّ: see رَاضٍ. ―
-b2-  Also, (K, TA,) i. e. like
غَنِىٌّ, (TA,) [in the CK الرِّضَى, and in my MS.
copy of the K الرِّضَا, are put in the place of الرَّضِىُّ,]
One who is responsible, accountable, or answerable; syn. ضَامِنٌ: so in the copies of the K, and
in like manner in the Tekmileh: accord. to the
copies of the T, ضَامِرٌ [lean, or light of flesh, &c.].
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And Loving; a lover; or a friend.
(IAar, K, TA.) ―
-b4-  And Obeying, or obedient.
(IAar, TA.)
رَاضٍ, of which the pl. is رُضَاةٌ; and ↓ رَضِىٌّ, of
which the pl. is أَرْضِيَآءُ and رُضَاةٌ, (M, K,) the
latter pl. on the authority of Lh, but extr. as pl.
of رَضِىٌّ, and in my opinion, [says ISd,] it is pl.
of رَاضٍ only; (M;) and ↓ رَضٍ, of which the pl.
is رَضُونَ; (Lh, M, K;) Pleased, well pleased,
content, contented, or satisfied; regarding with
good will, or favour; liking, or approving. (M,
K.) ―
-b2-  عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ means مَرْضِيَّةٌ [i. e. A state, or
sort, of life that is found pleasing, well pleasing,
contenting, or satisfying; or with which one is
pleased, &c.; or that is liked, or approved]: (S,
K:) or, accord. to Sb, رَاضِيَةٌ is, in this case, a
possessive epithet, meaning ↓ ذَاتُ رِضًى [i. e.
having approvedness; رِضًى being here an inf. n.
of رُضِيَتْ]. (M, TA.)
مَرْضَآةٌ, originally مَرْضَوَةٌ, (TA,) an inf. n. of
رَضِىَ. (S, * M, K.) ―
-b2-  [Also A cause, or means,
or an occasion, of رِضًى, i. e., of being pleased,
well pleased, conten, &c.: a word of the same
class as مَبْخَلَةٌ and مَجْبَنَةٌ. Hence the saying,]
البِرُّ مَرْضَاةٌ لِلرَّبِّ مَسْخَطَةٌ لِلشَّيْطَانِ [Piety is a
cause of approbation to the Lord, a cause of
disapprobation, or anger, to the devil]. (TA in
art. سخط.) The pl. of مَرْضَاةٌ is مَرَاضٍ [accord. to
rule]: or this is an irreg. pl. of رِضًى. (TA.)
مَرْضُوٌّ: see what follows.
مَرْضِىٌّ and ↓ مَرْضُوٌّ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) the
former the more common, (S, Msb,) the latter
erroneously written in [some of] the copies of the
K مَرْضُىٌّ, (TA,) applied to a thing, (S, Msb,) or
a person, (M,) Found pleasing, well pleasing,
contenting, or satisfying; or with which, or with
whom, one is pleased, &c.; or liked, or approved:
(K: [the meaning being there indicated to be the
contr. of مَسْخُوطٌ; and being well known to be
commonly as above:]) or chosen, or preferred:
(Msb:) or seen, or judged, to be fit for a thing or
an affair: (M:) [see also رِضًى, last sentence but
one; and رَاضٍ, latter sentence.]
Quasi رضى
رِضَيَانِ a dual of رِضًى, which see in art. رضو.
