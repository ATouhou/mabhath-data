ركد1
رَكَدَ, (S, A, Msb,) aor.
رَكُدَ, (Msb,) inf. n.
رُكُودٌ, (S Msb, K,) It was, or became, still, or
motionless; (S, A, Msb, K;) said of water: (S,
A, Msb:) and fixed, or stationary. (K.) And
in like manner, using the verb in the former
sense, one says of the wind: (S, A:) [whence]
one says also, رَكُدَتْ رِيحُهُمْ [lit. Their wind became still, or calm] meaning (tropical:)  their good fortune
ceased, and their affairs, or circumstances, began
to retrograde by degrees: and [in like manner,]
↓ طَفِقَتْ رِيحُهُمْ تَتَرَاكَدُ (tropical:)  [their good fortune
began to cease by degrees]. (A.) So too one says
of the expressed juice of grapes, meaning It
ceased to estuate. (L.) And of the heat, i. e. It
remitted, or subsided. (L. [See also رَقَدَ.]) And
رَكَدَتِ السَّفِينَةُ The ship became still, or motionless, (S, * A, * Msb, TA,) or aground. (TA.) And
رَكَدَ المِيزَانُ The balance was, or became, in a
state of equilibrium. (S, A, K.) And رَكَدَتِ البَكْرَةُ
The sheave of the pulley was, or became, fixed:
and also the sheave of the pulley turned, or
revolved: thus bearing two contr. significations.
(L.) And رَكَدَتِ الشَّمْسُ The sun was, or became,
at its midday-height: (S:) or continued overhead; as though not quitting its place. (A.)
And رَكَدَ القَوْمُ The people were, or became, still,
motionless, or silent. (S, A.)

And نَاقَةٌ رَكُودٌ (tropical:)  A she-camel whose supply of

رَاكِدٌ [Still, or motionless: and] anything
remaining fixed in its place; stationary. (S.)
You say مَآءٌ رَاكِدٌ Water that is not running:
and رِيحٌ رَاكِدَةٌ a wind becoming still, or calm;
pl. رِيَاحٌ رَوَاكِدُ. (A.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] الرَّوَاكِدُ [and
also, accord. to Reiske, as mentioned in Freytag's
Lex., الرُّكَّدُ,] The three pieces of stone upon
which a cooking-pot is set: so called because they
remain in their places. (L.)
مَرَاكِدُ [pl. of مَرْكَدٌ, like مَرْكَزٌ,] Places in
which a man, or some other thing, remains still,
or motionless. (S, A, * L.) And Much depressed
parts of the earth. (L.) Usámeh Ibn-Habeeb
El-Hudhalee says, describing an ass [i. e. a wild
ass] that had been chased by horses, or horsemen,
and had fied for refuge to the mountains, whence,
from their ravines, he saw the sky like streaks,
أَرْتْهُ مِنَ الجَرْبَآءِ فِى كُلِّ مَوْطِنٍ
طِبَابًا فَمَثْوَاهُ النَّهَارَ المَرَاكِدُ
[They (the ravines) showed him, in every spot
where he stopped, streaks of the shy, and the
much-depressed parts of the earth were his places
of abode all the day]. (S, * L.) [J quotes this
verse, in the S, but with مَنْزِلٍ in the place of
موطن, and مَرْعَاهُ in the place of مثواه, as an ex. of
مراكد in the former of the senses explained
above.]
