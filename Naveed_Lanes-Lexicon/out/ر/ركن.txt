ركن1
رَكَنَ إِلَيْهِ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
رَكُنَ; (S,
Msb, K;) of the dial. of the lower (سُفْلَى) [app.
in territory] of Mudar, and said by Az to be not
chaste [thought it, or the third, seems to be the
most common of the dial. vars. here mentioned];
(Msb;) and رَكِنَ aor.
رَكَنَ; (S, Msb, K;) mentioned by AZ; (S;) and رَكَنَ, aor.
رَكَنَ; (S, Msb,
K;) which is a combination of two dial. vars.,
[namely, the first and second of those above mentioned,] (S, Msb,) because neither the medial
nor the final radical letter is faucial; (Msb;)
said to be the only instance of its kind except
أَبَى aor. يَأَبَى; (T in art. ابى;) and رَكِنَ, aor.
رَكُنَ;
which is likewise an instance of the commixture
of two dial. vars., like فَضِلَ and حَضِرَ and نَعِمَ,
aor. يَفْضُلُ and يَحْضُرُ and يَنْعُمُ; (TA;) inf. n.
رُكُونٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and رَكَانَةٌ and رَكَانِيَةٌ;
(TA;) He inclined to him, or it; syn. مَالَ: and
he trusted to, or relied upon, him, or it, so as to
be, or become, easy, or quiet, in mind; syn. سَكَنَ:
(S, Mgh, K:) or he leaned, rested, or relied, upon
him; syn. اِعْتَمَدَ عَلَيْهِ: (Msb:) or he inclined
to him in the least degree; (Bd in xi. 115;)
رُكُونٌ signifying slight inclining. (Ksh and Bd
ibid.) It is said in the Kur [xi. 115], وَلَا تَرْكَنُوا
إِلَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا [And incline ye not, &c., to
those who have acted wrongfully]: (S, Msb:) or,
incline ye not in the least degree [&c.]: (Bd:)
thus generally read; and also تِرْكَنُوا, (Ksh, Bd,
TA,) accord. to the dial. of Temeem; and ↓ تُرْكَنُوا,
in the pass. form, from أَرْكَنَهُ. (Ksh, Bd.) ―
-b2-
رَكِنَ فِى المَنْزِلِ, aor.
رَكَنَ, inf. n. رَكْنٌ, He kept
tenaciously to the place of alighting, or abode,
(ضَنَّ بِهِ,) and did not relinquish it. (TA.)
-A2-
رَكُنَ, inf. n. رَكَانَةٌ (S, K) and رُكُونَةٌ (K) and
رَكَانِيَةٌ, (TK,) [primarily, it seems, said of a
mountain, meaning It was inaccessible, or difficult of access, having high, or strong أَرْكَان i. e.
sides or angles: see Har p. 561; and see رَكِينٌ,
below; and 5. ―
-b2-  And hence,] (tropical:)  He (a man)
was, or became, firm, (Har p. 561,) still, or
motionless, (TA,) grave, staid, steady, sedate; or
calm. (S, K, TA.)
2
ركّن is said by Golius, as on the authority
of the KL, to signify He made like, “similem
fecit: ” and hence Freytag also thus explains it: but
it is زكّن that has this signification. In my copy
of the KL, تَزْكِينٌ (not تَرْكِينٌ) is expl. by
مانند كردن.]
4
اركنهُ He made him to incline [إِلَى غَيْرِهِ to
another]; syn. أَمَالَهُ: [and to trust to, or rely
upon, another, so as to be, or become, easy, or
quiet, in mind: or to lean, rest, or rely, upon
another: see 1:] whence a reading in the Kur
xi. 115. (Ksh, Bd. *) See 1.
5
تركّن said of a man, (TA,) [or primarily
and properly, of a thing, like رَكُنَ,] He, [or it]
was, or became, firm, or strong, (K, TA,) and
inaccessible, or difficult of access. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
[hence,] (assumed tropical:)  He endeavoured, or constrained himself, to be grave, staid, steady, sedate, or calm;
syn. تَوَقَّرَ, (K,) and تَرَزَّنَ. (TA.)
رَكْنٌ The جُرَذ [or large field-rat]: and the
فَأْر [or common rat or mouse]; as also ↓ رُكَيْنٌ.
(K.)
رُكْنٌ The جَانِب [meaning side, or outward
part,] of a thing: (Msb:) or the strongest جَانِب
[i. e. side, or outward part,] (S, K, TA) of a
thing (S, TA) of any kind: (TA:) the corner, or
angle, (زَاوِيَة,) of a house or room or the like:
(K in art. زوى:) [and this is perhaps what is
meant by the “ strongest جانب; ” for the strongest
outward part of the house is unquestionably the corner, or angle: thus the angle in which is the Black
Stone, of the Kaabeh, is specially called رُكْنُ
البَيْتِ, i. e. رُكْنُ بَيْتِ اللّٰهِ:] the رُكْن of a قَصْر
[or palace, or pavilion, &c.,] is its جَانِب [or its
strongest جانب], and so of a mountain: (TA:
[see رَكُنَ, and رَكِينٌ:]) the pl. is أَرْكَانٌ and أَرْكُنٌ
[each properly a pl. of pauc., but the former is
used as a pl. of mult.]: (Msb, TA:) the أَرْكَان
of anything are is جَوَانِب [or sides, or outward
parts, or its corners, or angles,] upon which it
rests, and by which it is supported: (TA:) and
the أَرْكَان of a land are its extremities [or sides or
corners]. (Ham p. 478.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, (assumed tropical:)  A stay,
or support, of any kind: see an ex. voce مِرْجَمٌ:
whence, perhaps,] one says, تَمَسَّحْتُ بِأَرْكَانِهِ,
meaning تَبَرَّكْتُ بِهِ (tropical:)  [i. e. I looked for a blessing
by means of him, or it]. (TA.) (assumed tropical:)  A thing whereby
one is strengthened (مَا يُقَوَّى بِهِ [in the CK ما
تَقَوَّىبه]), such as dominion (مُلْك [in the CK
مَلِك]), and an army, or a military force, &c.:
(K:) and thus it has been explained as occurring
in the Kur [li. 39], where it is said, فَتَوَلَّى بِرُكْنِهِ,
(TA,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  And he turned away from belief
with his forces; because they were to him like the
رُكْن [properly so termed]. (Jel.) (assumed tropical:)  A man's
kinsfolk; or nearer, or nearest, relations; or clan;
or tribe; syn. عَشِيرَةٌ: (AHeyth, TA:) (assumed tropical:)  a man's
people, or party; and the higher among them;
and the persons by whom he is aided and strengthened: thought by ISd to be thus called by way
of comparison [to a رُكْن properly so termed]:
and thus it has been explained as used in the Kur
[xi. 82], where it is said, أَوْ آوِىَ رُكْنٍ شَدِيدٍ
(assumed tropical:)  [Or that I might have recourse to a strong
people, or party, &c.]: (TA:) or it here means
عَشِيرَة [explained above]. (Jel.) And (assumed tropical:)  A noble,
or high, person; as in the saying, هُوَ رُكْنٌ مِنْ
أَرْكَانِ قَوْمِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He is a noble, of the nobles of his
people]. (TA.) And أَرْكَانُ الإِنْسَانِ means (assumed tropical:)  The
members, or limbs, of the man, with which things
are gained or earned, or with which he works;
as the hands or arms, and the feet or legs. (TA.)
―
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Might, and resistance: (S, K:) so in
the saying, هُوَ يَأْوِى إِلَى رُكْنٍ شَدِيدٍ (assumed tropical:)  [He has
recourse to strong, or vehement, might and resistance]: (S:) and so it has been explained as used
in the words of the Kur last cited above. (TA.)
―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A thing, an affair, a case, an event, or
an action, of great magnitude or moment, momentous, formidable, or terrible. (AHeyth, K.) Thus
AHeyth explains it as used in the saying of En-Nábighah [Edh-Dhubyánee],
لَا تَقْذِفَنِّى بِرُكْنٍ لَا كِفَآءَ لَهُ
[By no means reproach thou me with a momentous, or a formidable, thing or action, or an
enormity, that has not its equal; though (he
proceeds to say) the enemies incite thee, with
companies of men aiding one another]. (TA.)
―
-b5-  In the conventional language [of the schools],
رُكْنُ الشَّىْءِ means (assumed tropical:)  [The essence of the thing;
or] that whereby the thing subsists: from التَّقَوُّمُ;
because the قِوَام [or subsistence] of the thing is
by its رُكْن: not from القِيَام: else it would
necessarily be the case that the agent would be a
رُكْن to the action; and the substance, to the
accident; and the thing to which a quality is
attributed, to the quality: (KT:) it is (assumed tropical:)  that
without which the thing has no subsistence:
(Kull:) and is [also] applied to (assumed tropical:)  [an essential,
or essential part, of the thing; i. e.,] a part of
the مَاهِيَّة [or essence] of the thing, (Kull, [and in
like manner أَرْكَانُ الشَّىْءِ is explained in the Msb
as meaning the parts of the ماهيّة of the thing,])
as when we say that القِيَام is a رُكْن of الصَّلَاْة; as
well as to (assumed tropical:)  the whole مَاهيّة [of the thing]: (Kull:)
[thus] أَرْكَانُ العِبَادَاتِ means (assumed tropical:)  the fundamentals
[or essentials] of the services of religion, by the
neglect, or non-observance, of which they are
ineffectual, or null, or void: (TA:) or, as some
say, رُكْنُ الشَّىْءِ means that whereby the thing is
complete; and this is intrinsic therein; differing
from the شَرْط [or condition] thereof, which is
extrinsic thereto. (KT.)
رَكِينٌ A mountain having high أَرْكَان [i. e.
sides, or angles]: (S, K:) or having strong اركان:
(TA:) or inaccessible, or difficult of access, having
اركان. (Har p. 561.) ―
-b2-  And hence, (Har
ibid.,) (tropical:)  A man (S, K, &c.) firm, (Har,) still, or
motionless, (TA,) grave, staid, steady, sedate, or
calm. (S, K, Har, TA.)
رُكَيْنٌ: see رَكْنٌ.
أَرْكُونٌ A great دِهْقَان, (K, TA,) i. e. headman,
or chief, of a village or town: [app. from the
Greek
ἄρχω ν; though it is said that] he is thus
called because the people of the village or town
trust to him and incline to him. (TA.)
مِرْكَنٌ A kind of vessel, well known, (K, TA,)
like a تَوْر [q. v.], of leather, used for water:
(TA:) or i. q. إِجَّانَةٌ [q.v.], (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,)
in which clothes and the like are washed; (TA;)
called in Pers. تَغَارْ: (Mgh:) pl. مَرَاكِنُ and
مَرَاكِينُ. (TA.) One says, زَرَعُوا الرَّيَا حِينَ فِى
المَرَاكِينِ [They sowed the sweet-smelling plants
in the مراكين]. (TA.)
مُرَكَّنٌ A thing having أَرْكَان [here meaning
corners, or angles]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] ضَرْعٌ مُرَكَّنٌ
A great udder; as though having اركان: (S,
TA:) and an udder that has opened [or expanded]
in its place so as to fill the أَرْفَاغ [or groins], and
is not very long. (TA.) Tarafeh says,
وَضَرَّتُهَا مُرَكَّنَةٌ دَرُورُ
[And her udder is great, having much milk: or,]
accord. to AA, مركّنة [here] signifies مجمّعة
[app. meaning collecting much]. (TA.) And
you say also نَاقَةٌ مُرَكَّنَةُ الضَّرْعِ (S, TA) [A she-camel great in the udder; or] whose udder has
أَرْكَان by reason of its greatness. (TA.)
