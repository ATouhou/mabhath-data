ارتتق It was, or became, closed up, (S, Msb,
K,) [and repaired; and sewed up, or together;]

رَتْقٌ i. q. ↓ مَرْتُوقٌ [and مَرْتُوقَةٌ, &c., being originally an inf. n.; i. e. Closed up, and repaired;
applied to a rent; and so ↓ رَتَقٌ]. (TA.) كَانَتَا
رَتْقًا فَفَتَقْنَاهُمَا, in the Kur [xxi. 31, lit. They (the
heavens and the earth) were closed up, and we
rent them], is from الرَّتْقُ as the contr. of الفَتْقُ:
(S:) accord. to Ibn-'Arafeh, it means they were
closed up, without any interstice, and we rent
them by the rain and by the plants: accord. to
Az, it means they were a heaven closed up and
an earth closed up, and we rent them into seven
heavens and seven earths: Lth says that the
heavens were closed up, no rain descending from
them; and the earth was closed up, without any
fissure therein; until God rent them by the rain
and the plants: Zj says that رَتْقًا is for ذَوَاتَىْ رَتْقٍ:
(TA:) and he says that the heaven and the earth
were united, and God rent them by the air, which
He placed between them: (TA in art. فتق:)
some read ↓ رَتَقًا, for شَيْئًا رَتَقًا, meaning مَرْتُوقًا.
(Bd.)
رَتَقٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two
places.
-A2-  It is [also] pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]
of ↓ رَتَقَةٌ, syn., accord. to the copies of the K,
with رُتْبَةٌ, but correctly with رَتَبَةٌ, which signifies
The space between [any two of] the fingers:
mentioned [in the JK, where I find the correct
reading, and] by Ibn-'Abbád. (TA.)
رَتَقَةٌ: see what next precedes.
رَتْقَآءُ, applied to a woman, (AHeyth, S, Mgh,
Msb, K,) or to a girl, (Lth,) [and also to a she-camel, (see 1, last sentence,)] Impervia coëunti;
(S, Msb, K;) having the meatus of the vagina
closed up: (S, * Msb:) or having no aperture
except the مَبَال [or meatus urinarius]: (Lth,
Mgh, K:) or having the فَرْج so drawn together
that the ذَكَر can hardly, or not at all, pass.
(AHeyth.)
رِتَاقٌ [A garment composed of] two pieces of
cloth sewed together (يُرْتَقَانِ) by their borders.
(Lth, S, K.) Hence the saying of a rájiz,
جَارِيَ بَيْضَآءُ فِى رِتَاقِ
تُدِيرُ طَرْفًا أَكْحَلَ المَآقِى
[A fair girl in a رتاق, turning about eyes black
in the inner angles.] (Lth, S. *)
رُتُوقٌ Inaccessableness, or unapproachableness;
(مَنَعَةٌ, [in some copies of the K, الخنعة is erroneously put for المَنَعَةُ,]) and might; and high, or
elevated, rank. (Ibn-'Abbád, K, TA.)
رَاتِقٌ [for سَحَابٌ رَاتِقٌ] Clouds closing up, or
coalescing. (AHn, TA.) ―
-b2-  هُوَ الفَاتِقُ الرَّاتِقُ (assumed tropical:)  He
is the possessor of command or rule, so that he
opens and closes, and straitens and widens. (Har
p. 208.) [See also مِخْلَطٌ.]
فَرْجٌ أَرْتَقُ A vulva of which the sides stick
together. (TA.)
مَرْتُوقٌ: see رَتْقٌ.
