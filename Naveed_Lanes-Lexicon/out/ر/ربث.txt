رَبِيثٌ i. q. ↓ مَرْبُوثٌ, (M, K,) Hindered, withheld, &c.: (M, * K:) the former, (T, M,) and the
latter also, (M,) applied to an affair, or an event.
(T, M.) One says, جَرْيُهُ كَرِيثٌ وَأَمْرُهُ رَبِيثٌ [app.
meaning His running is attended with difficulty,
and the accomplishment of his affair is hindered]:
(T: [in a copy of the A, as cited in the TA,
حِزْبُهُ is put in the place of جَرْيُهُ, which appears
to be the right reading, from what here follows:])
and
جَرْىٌ كَرِيثٌ أَمْرُهُ رَبِيثُ
[app. meaning A running attended with difficulty, the affair of which is hindered]: (M:)
كَرِيثٌ is [here] syn. with مَكْرُوثٌ. (T.)
-A2-  It is
also said to signify The جِرِّيث [or eel]; and so
↓ رَبِيثَةٌ: and in the " Jámi" of El-Ghooree,
↓ رِبِّيثَى with kesr to the ر and with teshdeed of
the ب, is said to mean a species of fish. (Mgh.)
رَبِيثَةٌ, (T, S, M, K,) a subst. from رَبَثَهُ signifying as expl. in the second sentence of this art.,
(T,) and ↓ رِبِّيثَى (T, S, M, K,) [in like manner
a subst.] from رَبَثَهُ signifying as expl. in the
first sentence of this art., (T,) A thing, or an
event, that hinders, withholds, restrains, or prevents, one [from a thing that he wants, and from
his affair; and that turns, or diverts, one therefrom; and that deceives, or deludes, one]: (S,
K:) or both signify deceit, or delusion; [in
which sense, accord, to the TA, the former word
is expl. in the K, but it is not so in my MS. copy
of the K nor in the CK;] and hindrance, restraint, or prevention: (M, TA:) pl. of the
former رَبَائِثُ. (TA.) You say, فَعَلَ ذٰلِكَ لَهُ رَبِيثَةً
and ↓ رِبِّيثَى He did that to him from a motive
of deceit, or delusion, and hindrance, restraint,
or prevention. (M.) And إِنَّمَا قُلْتُ ذٰلِكَ رَبِيثَةً مِنِّى
I said that only from a motive of deceit, or delusion, on my part. (ISk, T.) It is said in a trad.,
تَعْتَرضُ الشَّيَاطِينُ النَّاسَ يَوْمَ الجُمُعَةِ بِالَّربَائِثِ, meaning [The devils go forth against men indiscriminately, on Friday,] with the means of hindering them, or withholding them, from prayer:
(M:) or إِذَا كَانَ يَوْمُ الجُمُعَةِ بَعَثَ إِبْلِيسُ جُنُودَهُ
إِلَى النَّاسِ فَأَخَذُوا عَلَيْهِمْ بَالرَّبَائِثِ, i. e. [When Friday
is come, Iblees sends forth his forces to men, and]
they remind them of the wants that hinder, or
withhold, them [from the prayers of that day]:
(S:) or, as some relate it, ↓ يَرْمُونَ النَّاسَ بِالتَّرَابِيثِ,
which is said by El-Khattábee to be of no account;
but it may mean [they assail men with] hindrances; for تَرَابِيثُ may be pl. of ↓ تَرْبِيثَةٌ, inf. n.
un. of رَبَّثَهُ. (MF.)
