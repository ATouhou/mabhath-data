رُؤْدٌ; but more probably for the former, which see
in art. رود]; in the L, in one place, ↓ رَؤُدٌ; and in

the extremity of any branch or twig: the pl. is
أَرْآدٌ and أَرَائِدُ; the latter of which is extr.; and is
not a pl. pl.; for, were it so, it would be أَرَائِيدُ

(TA,) and some add رَادٌ, without ء, (MF,) (tropical:)  A

say غَيْرُ رَادَةِ ↓ اِمْرَأَةٌ رَأْدَةٌ, in which the former رادة
may be without ء, and the latter must be so,
meaning (tropical:)  A soft, or tender, woman; not one
that roves about. (A, TA.)
-A2-  Also رُؤْدٌ i. q. تُؤَدَةٌ
[Moderation; gentleness; a leisurely manner of
proceeding; &c.] (M, K. [In the latter, the form
of the word having this signification is not plainly
indicated.]) A poet says,
كَأَنَّهُ ثَمِلٌ يَمْشِى عَلَىرُودِ
[As though he were one intoxicated, walking in a
gentle, or leisurely, manner]; for علىرُؤدِ; suppressing the ء for the sake of the rhyme: but he
who regards the word as that of which رُوَيْدٌ is the
dim. does not regard it as originally with ء. (M,
TA.)

pl. أَرْآدٌ. (M.)
-A2-  Also Straitness: (K, TA: [in
the CK, الضّيِّقُ is erroneously put for الضِّيقُ:])
