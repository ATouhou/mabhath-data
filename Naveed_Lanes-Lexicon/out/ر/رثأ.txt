رثأ1
رَثَأَ, (S, M, K,) aor.
رَثَاَ, (M, K,) inf. n. رَثْءٌ,
(S, M,) He drew milk from the udder upon sour
milk, so that it thickened, (S, K,) and became
what is termed رَثِيْئَة: (K:) or he mixed fresh
milk with sour milk: or, as some say, he made
milk to become what is termed رَثِيْئَة: (M:) or it
has this last signification, and also signifies he
mixed [in an absolute sense]. (K.) [Az says,]
I heard an Arab of the desert, of Benoo-Mudarris,
say to a servant of his, اِرْثَأْ لِى لُبَيْنَةً أَشْرَبُهَا [Mix
thou for me a little milk so as to make رَثِيْئَة, which
I will drink]. (T.) And you say, رَثَأَ القَوْمَ (M,
K) and رَثَأَ لَهُمْ (M) He made for the party
رَثِيْئَة. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] هُمْ يَرْثَؤُونَ رَأْيَهُمْ, (S,)
and رَثَؤُوا رَأْيَهُمْ, (M,) inf. n. as above, (assumed tropical:)  They
confuse, or confound, and they confused, or confounded, their judgment, or opinion. (S, M.
[See also 8.]) ―
-b3-  And [hence also, perhaps, as
رثيئة is said to be beaten with a مِجْدَح in the
mixing of it,] He beat (K) with a staff, or stick.
(TA.)
-A2-  It (anger) became stilled, or appeased.
(K.)
-A3-  He (a camel) became affected with the
disease termed رَثْأَة. (K.)
-A4-  Also, (M, K,) inf. n.
as above, (M,) a dial. var. of رَثَى, meaning He
eulogized a man after his death [in verse or
otherwise; or he wept for him, or over him,
enumerating his good qualities or actions]: (M,
K: *) and in like manner one says of a woman
eulogizing her husband after his death; inf. n.
مَرْثِئَةٌ: (M:) ISk mentions an Arab woman's
saying رَثَأْتُ زَوْجِى بِأَبْيَاتٍ [I eulogized my husband
after his death with verses]; pronouncing the
verb with ء; but it is originally without ء: (S,
Sgh:) Fr says that her doing this arose from her
finding them to say رَثَأْتُ اللَّبَنَ and her therefore
supposing المَرْثِيَة to be from the same source:
(TA in the present art.:) or, accord. to Fr, their
chasteness of speech sometimes induced them to
pronounce with ء that which is [properly] without ء; and thus they said رَثَأْتُ المَيِّتَ and لَبَّأْتُ
بِالحَجِّ and حَلَّأْتُ السَّوِيقَ. (TA in art. رثو.)

أَرْثَاَ see the next paragraph.

ارتثأ It (milk) thickened, or became thick:
(S, K:) and so ↓ ارثأ, (M, K,) in some one or
more of the dialects. (M.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] ارتثأ
عَلَيْهِمْ أَمْرُهُمْ (assumed tropical:)  Their case, or affair, became confused to them. (S, M.) And ارتثأ فِى رَأْيِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He
made a confusion in his judgment, or opinion.
(S, K.) And هُمْ يَرْتَثِئُونَ أَمْرَهُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [app. for فِى
أَمْرِهِمْ, and thus meaning They are confused, or
they make a confusion, in their case, or affair:
or, otherwise, they confuse their case, or affair]:
from الرَّثِيْئَة; (T, TA;) and if so, tropical. (TA.)
-A2-  Also He drank what is termed رَثِيْئَة. (T, K.)
رَثْءٌ: see رَثْأَةٌ.
رُثْءٌ: see رُثْأَةٌ.
رَثْأَةٌ, (M, TA,) or ↓ رَثْءٌ, (K, [probably a
mistranscription,]) (assumed tropical:)  Littleness of intelligence or
sagacity: (M, K:) and (assumed tropical:)  weakness of heart:
(M, TA:) and (assumed tropical:)  foolishness, or stupidity; (K;)
and so ↓ رَثِيْئَةٌ (Th, M, K) and ↓ مَرْثَأٌ. (TA in art.
وأب.) ―
-b2-  Hence, perhaps, (TA,) the first of these
words (رَثْأَةٌ) signifies [also] (assumed tropical:)  A certain disease in
a camel's shoulder-joint, (K,) in consequence of
which he limps. (TA.)
رُثْأَةٌ, (M, TA,) or ↓ رُثْءٌ, (K, [probably a mistranscription,]) Blackness mixed with speckles of
white; or the reverse: syn. رُقْطَةٌ. (M, K.)
رَثِيْئَةٌ Sour milk upon which fresh milk is drawn
from the udder, so that it becomes thick: (Lh,
S, M, K:) or fresh milk poured upon sour, (As,
T, M, Mgh,) and then stirred about with a
[wooden instrument called] مِجْدَح until it becomes thick: (Lh, M:) or fresh milk upon which
sour milk is poured, then left a while, whereupon
thin yellow water [or whey] comes forth, and is
poured away from it, and then the thick is drunk.
(Har p. 451.) One says, الرَّثِيْئَةُ تَفْثَأُ الغَضَبَ (S,
TA) What is termed رثيئة stills, or appeases,
anger: (TA:) alluding to [the effect produced
by] a small kindness: a saying which originated
from a man's being incensed against some persons.
and being hungry, and their giving him to drink
some رثيئة, whereupon his anger became appeased:
(S in art. فثأ:) hence it became a proverb. (TA.)

أَرْثَأُ, fem. رَثْآءُ, A ram, and a ewe, black speckled
