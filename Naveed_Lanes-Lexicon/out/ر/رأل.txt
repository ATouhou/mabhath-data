استرألت الرِّئْلَانُ The young ostriches became
big, or advanced in age; syn. كَبِرَت, (O,) or
كَبُرَت, (so in one of my copies of the S, in the
other كَثُرَت [which is a mistranscription],) or
كَبُرَتْ أَسْنَانُهَا. (K: so in my MS. copy and in
the CK.) ―
-b2-  And [hence,] استرأل النَّبَاتُ (assumed tropical:)  The
plant, or herb, became tall; likened to the neck
of the young ostrich. (S, O, K.)
رَأْلٌ The young one of the ostrich: (T, S, M, K:)
or a young ostrich in its first year, or a year old:
(M, K:) it occurs in a verse of Imra-el-Keys
written رال, without ء: (M:) fem. with ة: (S, M,
K:) pl. (of pauc., TA) أَرْوُلٌ (K, TA, [in the
TT, as from the M, written ارْأَل, probably for
أَرْأُلٌ,]) and (of mult., TA) رِئْلَانٌ and رِئَالٌ (S, M,
K) and رِئَالَةٌ. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] الرِّئَالُ [which
seems to be the most common of the plso] (assumed tropical:)  Certain stars: (S, Sgh, K:) [probably certain small
stars in the neighbourhood of those called النَّعَائِمُ,
or of those called النَّعَامَاتُ (in Cetus), and regarded
as the young ones of these.] ―
-b3-  [Hence also,]
زَفَّ رَأْلُهُ (tropical:)  He was, or became, light of intellect,
lightwitted, or irresolute. (S and Z and TA in
art. زف.) And زَفَّ رَأْلِى (assumed tropical:)  I was, or became,
affected with sadness, or disquietude of mind, like
the young ostrich by reason of fear, or fright; a
phrase like شَالَتْ نَعَامَتُهُمْ meaning “ They were
frightened, and fled. ” (M.) And زَفَّ رَأْلُهُمْ (assumed tropical:)  They
perished, or died. (TA.) And خَوَّدَ رَأْلُهُ (assumed tropical:)  He
was, or became, frightened. (Ham p. 179.)
رُؤَالٌ and ↓ رَاؤُولٌ, (As, T, M, K, [the latter in
the CK رَاؤُل,]) with ء accord to ISk, and without ء accord. to A'Obeyd, (M,TA,) The slaver of
a horse (As, ISk, T, M, K, TA) or similar beast,
(ISk, T,) that drops from him: (TA:) or his
froth, or foam: (K:) accord. to Lth, رُوَالٌ [q. v.

a horse or similar beast. (T.)
-A2-  Also the former,
(M,) or ↓ the latter, (K,) A redundance in [the
number of] the teeth of a horse or similar beast:
(M, K:) but As denies that these two words have
this meaning. (T. [See what next follows.])
رَائِلٌ and ↓ رَائِلَةٌ, accord. to Lth, signify A tooth
that grows to a horse or similar beast, preventing
him from drinking [with ease] and from [eating
in the manner termed] قَضْم: and accord. to En-Nadr, [the pl.] رَوَائِلُ signifies small teeth that
grow at the roots of the large teeth, and excavate
the roots of the latter so that these fall out: (T:)
but As disallows this. (TA. [See also art. رول:
and see the latter sentence of the next preceding
paragraph.])
