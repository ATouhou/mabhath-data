رشو1
رَشَا, said of a young bird, It stretched forth
its head to its mother in order that she should
put food into its beak. (Abu-l-'Abbás [Th],
Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, [accord. to Th, but see
رِشْوٌة, below,] رَشَاهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. ويَرْشُو,
inf. n. رَشْوٌ, (S, Msb,) He gave him a رِشْوَة [or
bribe]. (S, * Mgh, Msb, K.) [See also 3.]
3
راشاهُ, (S, ISd, K,) inf. n. مُرَاشَاةٌ, (TA,) i. q.
صَانَعَهُ [He bribed him; (see also 1;) or endeavoured to conciliate him; or did to him a thing
in order that he (the latter) might do to him (the
former) another thing]: (K:) and حَابَاهُ [app. as
meaning he treated him, or behaved towards him,
with partiality]: (ISd, K:) or ظَاهَرَهُ [he aided
him, or assisted him]. (S.)
4
ارشى الدَّلْوَ He put a رِشَآء [or rope]. to the
bucket. (S, ISd, K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] ارشى said of
the colocynth [or any similar plant (see رِشَآءٌ)]
(assumed tropical:)  It extended its rope-like branches [or stalks].
(Az, S, K, ↓ TA.)
-A2-  أَرْشَيْتُ الفَصِيلَ, (S, K,) inf. n.
إِرْشَآءٌ, (S,) I made the young camel to suck, or to
be suckled. (S, K.)
5
ترشّاهُ He was soft, tender, gentle, bland, or

8
ارتشى He took, or received, a رِشْوَة [or
bribe], (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) مِنْهُ from him. (Mgh.)
10
استرشى He sought, or desired, to be suchled; said of a young camel. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  And
استرشى مَا فِى الضَّرْعِ He drew forth what was

-b3-  [Hence, probably,]
استرشى فِى حُكْمِهِ He sought, or desired, or demanded, a رِشْوَة [or bribe] in the case of his deciding judicially, for his doing so [agreeably with
the desire of the briber]. (S, K, ↓ TA.)
رِشْوَةٌ and رُشْوَةٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and
رَشْوَةٌ, (Lth, K,) of which the first is that which is
the most commonly used, (TA,) i. q. جُعْلٌ [as
meaning A bribe]; (K, TA;) i. e. (TA) a thing
that one gives to a judge, or to another person, in
order that he may judge in his [the giver's]
favour, or to incite him to do what he [the giver]
desires; (Msb, TA;) or a means of attaining that
which one wants, by bribery; not including what
is given as a means of obtaining a right or repelling a wrong; for it is related on the authority
of several of the leading doctors of the Tábi'ees
that there is no harm in man's bribing for the
defence of himself and his property when he fears
being wronged; so says IAth: and Lth explains
the last of these three words as meaning an act of
bribery: (TA:) accord. to Abu-l-'Abbás [i. e.
Th], (TA), the former meaning is from رَشَا said
of a young bird, explained in the first sentence of
this art.: (Msb, TA:) or it is from الرِّشَآءُ, (IAth,
Mgh, TA,) signifying “ that by means of which
one obtains water,” (IAth, TA,) or “ the rope of
the bucket: ” (Mgh:) or, accord. to ISd, the
reverse of this is the case: (TA:) the pl. (of the
first, Msb, TA) is رِشًا or رِشًى and (of the second,
Msb, TA) رُشًا or رُشًى. (S, Msb, K, TA.)
رِشَآءٌ A rope: (S, Msb, K:) [or a well-rope;
i. e.] the rope of the bucket: (Mgh:) and ↓ تِرْشَآءٌ,
also, with kesr, has the same meaning as رِشَآءٌ:
(K:) hence it would seem that this is generally
the case; but they have expressly declared that
the latter word has not been heard except in
relation to the like of an enchantment, or a fascination: so says MF, pointing to the saying of
Lh, that among the phrases of women who enchant, or fascinate, men is أَخَّذْتُهُ بِدُبَّآء مُمَلَّأٍ مِنَ
المَآء مُعَلَّقٍ بِتِرْشَآء [I have enchanted him, or fascinated him, with a gourd, filled with water,
suspended by a rope, or well-rope]; and that
ترشاء, meaning a rope, is not thus said except in
this enchantment, or fascination: accord. to ISd,
the last radical of رشاء is judged to be و because
one obtains water by means of the رشاء, like as
one obtains the thing sought by means of the
رِشْوَة; which is the reverse what has been said
above, that الرشوة is from الرشاء: (TA:) the pl. is
أَرْشِيَةٌ. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  الرَّشَآءُ is also the
name of (assumed tropical:)  A Mansion of the Moon; (K, TA;)
[the Twenty-eighth, which is the last, of the Mansions of the Moon;] so called as being likened to
a rope; (TA;) [the northern fish, of the constel-lation Pisces, together with the star beta of Andromeda; or, more correctly, delta and epsilon, with some
neighbouring stars, of Pisces;] a group of many
stars, in the form of a fish, with the tail towards
the south and the head towards the north;
(Kzw;) many small stars, in the form of a fish,
called [also] بَطْنُ الحُوتِ, in the navel of which
is a bright star, which the moon makes one of its
mansions; (S, TA;) [or including بطن الحوت,
which is in the navel of Andromeda; for] بطن
الحوت is the name of the bright star [beta] that is
above the drapery round the waist of Andromeda:
(Kzw, descr. of Andromeda:] الرشاء is also called
قَلْبُ الحُوتِ. (TA in art. قلب.) [See مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ,
in art. نزل.]
رَشِىٌّ A young camel; syn. فَصِيلٌ. (K.) [See
4, last sentence.]
رَاشٍ The giver of a رِشْوَة [or bribe]: hence the
trad., لَعَنَ اللّٰهُ الرَّاشِىَ وَالمُرْتَشِىَ وَالرَّائِشَ, i. e.
[May God curse] the giver of a رِشْوَة, who aids
another to do what is wrong, and the receiver
thereof, and him who is agent between them two,
demanding more for this or less for this. (IAth,
TA.)
تِرْشَآءٌ: see رِشَآءٌ, first sentence.
مُرْتَشٍ The receiver of a رِشْوَة [or bribe]. (IAth,
TA.) [See an ex. above, voce رَاشٍ.]
مُسْتَرْشٍ A seeker, desirer, or demander, of a
رِشْوَة [or bribe]. (TK.) Hence, (TK,) one says,
إِنَّكَ لَمُسْتَرْشٍ لِفُلَانٍ, [in the TA إِلَى فُلَانٍ,] i. e.
مُطِيعٌ لَهُ تَابِعٌ لِمَسَرَّتِهِرص [app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  Verily thou
art obedient to such a one, subservient to that
which gives him happiness]. (K, TK.)
