plank] the middle of which is placed upon a heap
of earth or the like, then a boy sits upon one end

thus explained in the 'Eyn and its Abridgment,
and in the Jámi' of Kz, and thus Th says on the
authority of IAar: (TA:) [accord. to the CK
and some MS. copies of the K, these two words
signify the same as رُجَّاحَةٌ; but accord. to other
copies of the K, and the TA, the meaning of this
last word is different from that of the two preceding words: see also زُحْلُوقَةٌ:] the pl. of the
