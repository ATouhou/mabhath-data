became strong in his back, [so as to be fit for the

the thing that is put upon the camel for the purpose of riding thereon; (Er-Rághib, TA;) smaller
than the قَتَب; (S, TA;) one of the vehicles of
men, exclusively of women: (TA:) [this seems
to be regarded as the primary signification by the
authors of the Mgh and the K and by Er-Rághib:
but see what follows:] or it signifies the camel's
saddle together with his [girths called] رَبَض and
حَقَب and his [cloth called] حِلْس [that is put beneath the saddle], and all its other appertenances:
and is applied also to the pieces of wood of the
رَحْل, without any apparatus: (AO, Sh, TA:)
or it signifies anything, or everything, that a man
prepares for removing, or journeying; such as a
bag, or receptacle, for goods or utensils or apparatus, and a camel's saddle, and a [cloth such as
is called] حِلْس [that is put beneath the saddle],
and a رَسَن [or rope for leading his camel]:
(Msb:) or it signifies as first explained above, and
also the goods, or utensils, or apparatus, which a
man takes with him [during a journey]: (S, K,
TA:) [but accord. to the Msb, this signification
is from another, mentioned below; and the same
seems to be indicated in the S, which reverses the
order in which I have mentioned the three significations that I quote from it:] this last signification is disapproved by El-Hareeree, in the “ Durrat el-Ghowwás: ” [but see two exs. voce حُذَافَةٌ:]
the pl. is أَرْحُلٌ and رِحَالٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;)
the former a pl. of pauc.; (S, TA;) the latter, of
mult. (TA.) One says, حَطَّ رَحْلَهُ and أَلْقَى رَحْلَهُ
[He put down his camel's saddle]; meaning he
stayed, or abode. (TA.) And هٰذَا مَحَطُّ الرِّحَالِ

put down]. (TA.) And in reviling, one says,
يَا ابْنَ مُلْقَىأَرْحُلِ الرُّكْبَانِ [O son of the place in
which are thrown down the camels' saddles of
the riders; as though the person thus addressed
were there begotten]; (S, O, TA;) meaning
يَا ابْنَ الفَاجِرَةِ [O son of the adulteress or fornicatress]: (TA in art. لقى:) or هُوَ ابن ملقى ارحل
الركبان [He is the son &c.]. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  Er-Rághib, after giving the explanation mentioned
as on his authority above, says that it is then
sometimes applied to The camel [itself]: and is
sometimes used in the sense next following; i. e.
―
-b3-  A part, of a place of alighting or abode, upon
which on sits: (TA:) or a man's dwelling, or
habitation; (S, K, TA;) [in the first of which,

author held this to be the primary signification;])
his house or tent; and his place of alighting or
abode: (TA:) a place to which a man betakes
himself, or repairs, for lodging, covert, or refuge;
a man's place of resort; (Mgh, Msb;) in a
region, district, or tract, of cities, towns, or
villages, and of cultivated land: and then applied
to the goods, utensils, or apparatus, of a traveller;
because they are, in travelling, the things to
which he betakes himself: (Msb:) pl. أَرْحُلٌ (TA)
and رِحَالٌ [as above]. (Mgh, TA.) One says,
دَخَلْتُ عَلَى الرَّجُلِ رَحْلَهُ, i. e. [I went in to the
man in] his dwelling, or place of abode. (TA.)
And it is said in a trad., إِذَا ابْتَلَّتِ النِّعَالُ فَصَلُّوا
فِى الرِّحَالِ, (TA,) or فِىلصَّلَاةُ فِى الرِّحَالِ, (Mgh,
and so in the TA in art. نعل,) i. e. [When the
نِعَال are moistened by rain, then pray ye, or then
prayer shall be performed,] in the houses, or
habitations, or places of abode; the نعال meaning
here the حِرَار; (IAth, TA in the present art.;)
or rugged and hard tracts of ground; which are
here particularized because the least wet moistens
them, whereas the soft tracts dry up the water:
(IAth, TA in art. نعل:) Az says that the meaning is, when the hard grounds are rained upon,
they become slippery to him who walks upon
them; therefore pray ye in your abodes, and
there shall not be anything brought against you
for your not being present at the prayer in the
mosques of the congregations: (TA in that art.:)
or the trad. may mean, then pray ye [on the
camels' saddles, i. e.] riding. (TA in the present
art.) ―
-b4-  In another trad., it is related that 'Omar
said to the Prophet, حَوَّلْتُ رَحْلِىَ البَارِحَةَ; by the
word رَحْل, as signifying [properly] either the
“ place of abode and resort ” or the “ saddle upon
which camels are ridden,” alluding to his wife;
meaning غِشْيَانُهَا فِى قُبُلِهَا مِنْ جِهَةِ ظَهْرِهَا (TA.)
―

renders fit for the saddle, or for journeying;]
and fleetness, or swiftness, and excellence: (TA:)
[and ↓ رِحْلَةٌ has a similar meaning, as appears
from what follows:] or excellence of pace of a
camel. (S voce حِضَارٌ.) You say بَعِيرٌ ذُو رُحْلَةٍ
and ↓ رِحْلَةٍ, and ↓ مِرْحَلٌ, like مِنْبَرٌ, (K,) or
↓ مُرْحِلٌ, and ↓ رَحِيلٌ, so in the T, (TA,) A strong
he-camel: (T, K:) and (so in the K [but properly
“ or ”]) بعير ذو رُحْلَةٍ (CK) or ↓ رِحْلَةٍ (K accord.
to the TA) or both, and ↓ مِرْحَلٌ, with kesr to the
م (O,) and ↓ جَمَلٌ رَحِيلٌ, (AA, S, S, O, K, TA,)

ذَاتُ رُحْلَةٍ, (S,) a he-camel, (S, O, K,) and a she-camel, (S, O,) strong to journey; (S, O, K, TA;)
so says Fr: (O:) or strong to be saddled: (TA:)

to the “ Nawádir el-Aaráb,” a she-camel that is
excellent, generous, of high breed; or strong,
light, and swift; (TA;) and so ↓ مُسْتَرْحِلَةٌ. (K,
TA. [See also رَاحِلَةٌ.]) ―
-b2-  See also the next
paragraph, in seven places.
رِحْلَةٌ The act of saddling of camels: (K, * TA:)
[and also, agreeably with analogy, a mode, or
manner, of saddling of camels:] so in the saying,
إِنَّهُ لَحَسَنُ الرِّحْلَةِ [Verily he is good in respect of
the saddling, or the mode or manner of saddling,
of camels]. (K.) ―
-b2-  Also A removal, departure,
or journey; (AZ, S, Msb, K;) and so ↓ رُحْلَةٌ,
(Lh, Msb, K,) and ↓ رَحِيلٌ: (S, K: [the last
said in the Msb to be and inf. n.:]) you say دَنَتْ
رِحْلَتُنَا (S) or قَرُبَتْ رِحْلَتُنَا (Msb) [Our removal,
&c., drew near, or has drawn near]: and إِنَّهُ
لَذُو رِحْلَةٍ إِلَى المُلُوكِ and ↓ رِحْلَة Verily he is one
who journeys, or has journeyed, to the kings:
(Lh, TA:) and in like manner رُحْلَةٌ is used in the
Kur cvi. 2: (TA:) ―
-b3-  or ↓ رِحْلَةٌ with damm,
(S, Msb, K,) signifies The thing to which one
removes, departs, or journeys; (AZ, Msb;) or
the direction, or point, or object, to which one
desires to repair, or betakes himself: (AA, S,
Msb, K:) and also, (K,) or رُحْلَةٌ, (TA,) a single
journey; (K, TA;) as ISd says: (TA:) you say,
↓ مَكَّةُ رُحْلَتِى Mekkeh is the point, or object, to
which I desire to remove, or depart, or journey:
(TA:) and ↓ أَنْتُمْ رُحْلَتِى Ye are they to whom I
remove, or depart, or journey: (S, TA:) and
↓ أَنْتَ رُحْلَتُنَا Thou art the object to which we
repair, or betake ourselves. (Msb.) And hence
↓ رُحْلَةٌ is applied to signify A noble, or an exalted,
person, or a great man of learning, to whom one
journeys for his [the latter's] need, or want, or
for his [the former's] science. (TA.) ―

the next preceding paragraph, in three places.
رَحُولٌ: see رَاحِلَةٌ: ―
-b2-  and رَحَّالٌ.
رَحِيلٌ A camel having the saddle (رَحْل [not
رحالة as in Freytag's Lex.]) put upon him; as
also ↓ مَرْحُولٌ. (K.) ―
-b2-  See also رُحْلَةٌ, in four
places.

رِحَالَةٌ A سَرْج [or horse's saddle]: (K:) or a
سَرْج of skins, (S, M, Msb, K,) in which is no
wood; used for vehement running [of the horse]:
(S, M, K:) ISd says also that it is one of the
vehicles [or saddles] of women, like the رَحْل:
but Az says that it is one of the vehicles [or
saddles] of men, exclusively of women, i. e. not
of women; as is also the رَحْل: and some say that
it is larger than the سَرْج, covered with skins, and
is for horses, and for excellent, or strong and
light and swift, camels: (TA:) pl. رَحَائِلُ. (S.)
When a man is hasty in doing evil to his companion, one says to him, اِسْتَقْدَمَتْ رِحَالَتُكَ [lit.
Thy saddle has got before thee, or shifted forwards]: (S in the present art.:) it is a prov.,
meaning that has preceded than which another
was more fit to do so. (S in art. قدم.) In the
following saying of Imra-el-Keys, addressing
his wife,
فَإِمَّا تَرَيْنِى فِى رِحَالَةِ جَابِرٍ
عَلَى حَرَجٍ كَالْقَرِّتَخْفِقُ أَكْفَانِى
[And either thou wilt see me upon the saddle of
Jábir, upon a bier like the vehicle called قَرّ, my
grave-clothes fluttering], he means, by the word
رحالة, [merely] the حَرَج; there being in this
case no رحالة in reality: it is like the saying,
جَآءَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى نَاقَةِ الحَذَّآءِ, meaning [“ Such a
one came upon] the sandal [or sandals]: ” Jábir
is the name of a certain carpenter. (S.)
-A2-  Also
A ewe. (Ibn-'Abbád, TA.) [Hence,] رِحَالَهْ رِحَالَهْ
is A call to the ewe, (Ibn-'Abbád, K,) on the
occasion of milking. (Ibn-'Abbád, TA.) ―
-b2-  And
الرِّحَالَةُ is the name of A certain horse of 'Ámir
Ibn-Et-Tufeyl; (K;) erroneously said by AO
to be الحمالة. (TA.)
رَحُولَةٌ: see رَاحِلَةٌ.
رَحَّالٌ Skilled in the saddling of camels. (K.)
―
-b2-  Also A man who removes, or journeys, or
travels, much; and so ↓ رَحَّالَةٌ, [or rather this
signifies one who removes, or journeys, or travels,
very much,] and ↓ رَحُولٌ: and ↓ رُحَّلٌ [pl. of
رَاحِلٌ, q. v.,] persons who remove, or journey, or
travel, much. (TA.)
رَحَّالَةٌ: see what next precedes.
رَاحِلٌ Removing, (K, TA,) going, [going away,
departing, going forth,] or journeying: (TA:)
pl. رُحَّلٌ. (TA.) For another meaning assigned
to the pl., see رَحَّالٌ.
رَاحِلَةٌ A she-camel that is fit to be saddled;
(S, Msb, K;) thus some say; (Msb;) as also
↓ رَحُولٌ (S, K) and ↓ رَحُولَةٌ: (K:) or [generally
a saddle-camel, or] a camel that is ridden, male
or female: (S, Msb:) accord. to IKt, a she-camel
that is strong to journey and to bear burdens;
and such as a man chooses for his riding and his
saddle on account of excellence, or generousness,
or high breed, or of strength and lightness and
swiftness, and of perfectness of make, and beauty
of aspect: but this explanation is wrong: (Az,
TA:) it signifies a he-camel, and a she-camel,
that is excellent, or generous, or high-bred, or
strong and light and swift: (Az, Mgh, TA:) the
she-camel is not more entitled to this appellation
than the he-camel: (Az, TA:) the ة is added
to give intensiveness to the signification; as in
دَاهِيَةٌ and بَاقِعَةٌ and عَلَّامَةٌ, epithets applied to a
man: or, as some say, the she-camel is so called
because she is saddled; and it is like عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ
meaning مَرْضِيَّةٌ, and مَآءٌ دَافِقٌ meaning مَدْفُوقٌ: or,
as others say, because she is ذَاتُ رَحْلٍ [one having
a saddle]; and in like manner, عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ means
ذَاتُ رَضًى, and مَآءٌ دَافِقٌ means ذُو دَفْقٍ: (TA:)
the pl. is رَوَاحِلُ. (S, Msb.) It is said in a trad.,
تَجِدُونَ النَّاسَ بَعْدِى كَإِبِلٍ مِائَةٍ لَيْسَ فِيهَا رَاحِلَةٌ
[Thou wilt find the people, or mankind, after me,
like a hundred camels among which there is not
a راحلة]: (Mgh, * TA:) because the راحلْ among
a herd of camels is conspicuous and known.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  مَشَتْ رَوَاحِلِى, a phrase used by the
poet Dukeyn, means (tropical:)  I have become hoary and
weak: or, as some say, I have forsaken my ignorant, or foolish, behaviour, and have restrained
myself from foul conduct, and become obedient
to my censurers; like as the راحلة obeys her
chider, and goes. (TA.)
رَاحُولٌ: see رَحْلٌ, first sentence.
رَاحُولَاتٌ A camel's saddle, (رَحْلٌ, Az, K,) or
camel's saddles, so in the O, (TA,) variegated,
figured, or embellished. (Az, O, K, TA.) [It is
really, as well as literally, a pl.: for] a poet says,
عَلَيْهِنَّ رَاحُولَاتُ كُلِّ قَطِيفَةٍ
[Upon them (referring evidently to she-camels)
are variegated, figured, or embellished, saddles
of every kind of villous, or nappy, cloth]. (TA.)
أَرْحَلُ (tropical:)  A horse white in the back; (S, Mgh,
K;) because it is the place of the رَحْل [or rather
of the رِحَالَة]; (Mgh, TA;) the whiteness not
reaching to the belly nor to the rump nor to the
neck: (TA:) and a sheep or goat black in the
back: accord. to Abu-l-Ghowth, the fem., رَحْلَآءُ,
applied to a mare, has the former meaning only:
(S:) but شَاةٌ رَحْلَآءُ means a sheep or goat, or a
ewe or she-goat, white in the back, and black in
the other parts; and likewise black in the back,
and white in the other parts: (S, K: *) so says
Abu-l-Ghowth: (S:) and it is also explained as
meaning black, but white in the place of the
saddle, from the hinder parts of the shoulderblades: also as meaning white, but black in the
back: Az adds that such as is white in one of the
hind legs is termed رَجْلَآءُ [with جيم]. (TA.)
تَرْحِيلٌ (assumed tropical:)  A whiteness predominating over, or
interrupted by, blackness, (شُهْبَةٌ,) or a redness,
upon the shoulder-blades, (K, TA,) the place upon
which lies the رَحْل [or camel's saddle]. (TA.)
تَرْحِيلَةٌ A thing that makes thee to remove, go,
go away, depart, go forth, or journey; expl. by
مَا يُرَحّلُكَ. (TA.)
مُرْحِلٌ One who breaks, or trains, and renders
fit to be saddled, a camel or camels. (TA.) ―
-b2-
A man having many [camels such as are termed]
رَوَاحِل [pl. of رَاحِلَةٌ]; like مُعْرِبٌ meaning “ having
horses such as are termed عِرَاب ” (A'Obeyd, S.)
-A2-  A camel strong in the back, [so as to be fit
for the رَحْل,] after weakness. (IDrd, TA.) And
A fat camel; though he be not excellent, or generous, or high-bred, or strong and light and swift:
so in the “ Nawádir el-Aaráb. ” (TA.) See also
رُحْلَةٌ, in two places.
مِرْحَلٌ: see رُحْلَةٌ, in two places.
مَرْحَلَةٌ [A station of travellers; i. e.] a place
of alighting or abode, between two such places:
(TA:) [and also a day's journey, or thereabout;
or] the space which the traveller journeys in about
a day: (Msb:) sing. of مَرَاحِلُ; (S, Msb, K;)
which is also a pl. of مُرَحَّلٌ as an epithet applied
to a بُرْد. (TA.) One says, بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَ كَذَا
مَرْحَلَةٌ أَوْمَرْحَلَتَانِ [Between me and such a place,
or thing, is a station or a day's journey or thereabout, or are two stations &c.]. (S, TA.)
إِبِلٌ مُرَحَّلَةٌ Camels having their رِحَال [or
saddles] upon them: and also camels whose رِحَال
have been put down from them: thus having two
contr. meanings. (K.) ―
-b2-  And بُرْدٌ مُرَحَّلٌ A garment of the kind termed بُرْد upon which are the
figures of a رَحْل [or camels' saddle], (K,) and
the like thereof; as in the T: (TA:) the explanation that J has given of it, [or rather of
مِرْطٌ مُرَحَّلٌ,] i. e. an إِزَار [or a waist-wrapper] of
[the cloth called] خَزّ, upon which is an ornamented border, is not good: such is termed مُرَجَّلٌ,
with جِيم: (K:) the pl. is مُرَحَّلَاتٌ and مَرَاحِلُ;
both occurring in traditions; (TA in the present
art.;) and the latter of them said in the T to be
syn. with مَرَاجِلُ, which is pl. of مِرْجَلٌ [q. v.].
(TA in art. رجل.)
مَرْحُولٌ: see رَحِيلٌ.
مُرْتَحَلٌ signifies [The act of removing or departing; i. e.] the contr. of مَحَلٌّ used in the
sense of حُلُولٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And sometimes it signifies The place in which one alights, or descends
and stops. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also The place of the رَحْل
[which may here mean either the saddle or the
saddling] of a camel. (TA.)
الحَالُّ المُرْتَحِلُ: see art. حل.
مُسْتَرْحِلَةٌ, applied to a she-camel: see رُحْلَةٌ.
