of a رَاهِب, (A, Msb,) or Christian devotee;
(Mgh;) the masdar of رَاهِبٌ, (JK, S, K,) as also
↓ رَهْبَةٌ: (S, K:) or it is originally from الرَّهْبَةُ;
and by a secondary application is used as a noun
signifying excess, or extravagance: (AAF, TA:)
or it is from ↓ رَهْبَنَةٌ, [which has the same signification, of the measure فَعْلَنَةٌ from رَهْبَةٌ, or فَعْلَلَةٌ
on the supposition that the ن is a radical letter:
(IAth, TA:) or it signifies excess in religious
services or exercises, and discipline, and the
detaching oneself from mankind; and is from
رَهْبَانُ, signifying “excessively fearful:” so in the
Kur lvii. 27; where it is said, وَرَهْبَانِيَّةً ابْتَدَعُوهَا,
(Bd,) meaning وَابْتَدَعُوا رَهْبَانِيَّةً ابْتَدَعُوهَا [And
they innovated excess &c.: they innovated it]:
(AAF, Bd, TA:) and some read with damm,
[رُهْبَانِيَّةً,] as though from رُهْبَانٌ, pl. of رَاهِبٌ.
(Bd.) It is said in a trad., (TA,) لَا رَهْبَانِيَّةَ فِى
الإِسْلَامِ [There is no monkery in El-Islám]; i. e.,
no such thing as the making oneself a eunuch, and
putting chains upon one's neck, and wearing garments of hair-cloth, and abstaining from flesh-meat, and the like. (K.) And in another trad.,
عَلَيْكُمْ بِالْجِهَادِ فَإِنَّهُ رُهْبَانِيَّةُ أُمَّتِى [Keep ye to the
waging of war against the unbelievers, for it is
the asceticism of my people]. (TA.)

cartilage, or lower extremity of the sternum;] a

the tongue of the dog: (TA:) or a certain cartilage, resembling the tongue, suspended in the lower
part of the breast, impending over the belly:
(TA:) the tongue of the sternum, at the lower
part: (ISh, TA:) or, accord. to IAar, the extremity of the stomach: (TA:) pl. [or rather
coll. gen. n.] ↓ رَهَابٌ [and رُهَابٌ]. (K.)
رَهَّابَةٌ and رُهَّابَةٌ: see what next precedes.
رَاهِبٌ Fearing; [or a fearer; or fearing with
caution; or a cautious fearer;] as in the phrase
هُوَ رَاهِبٌ مِنَ اللّٰهِ [He is one who fears God; or a
fearer of God; &c.]: whence the signification
next following. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  A Christian [monk,
ascetic, religious recluse, or] devotee; (Mgh, Msb;)
one who devotes himself to religious services or
exercises, in a صَوْمَعَة [or cell]; (TA;) one of the
رُهْبَان of the Christians: (S, K:) [i. e.] the pl. is
رُهْبَانٌ (A, Mgh, Msb) and رَهَبَةٌ; (A;) or, sometimes, رُهْبَانٌ is a sing.; (K;) as in the following
ex., cited by IAar:
لَوْ كَلَّمَتْ رُهْبَانَ دَيْرٍ فِى القُلَلْ
لَانْحَدَرَ الرُّهْبَانُ يَسْعَى فَنَزَلْ
[If she spoke to a Christian monk in a monastery
among the summits of a mountain, the Christian
monk would come down running, and so descend]:
but he says that the approved way is to use it as
a pl.: (TA:) and رَهَابِينُ is a pl. (A, Msb, K) of
رُهْبَانٌ, (K,) and رَهَابِنَةٌ is another pl. (A, K) of
the same, and so is رُهْبَانُونَ. (K.)
-A2-  See also
مَرْهُوبٌ.
رَاهِبَةٌ A state, or condition, that frightens. (TA.)
أَرْهَابٌ Birds that are not rapacious; that do
not prey. (K.) [App. so called because timid; as
Golius supposes.]
مُرَهِّبٌ, applied to a she-camel, [though of a
masc. form,] Fatigued in her back. (TA. [See
its verb, 2.])
مَرْهُوبٌ Feared: (Mgh, Msb:) [or feared with
caution:] applied to God. (Msb.) In the phrase
لَبَّيْكَ مَرْهُوبٌ وَمَرْغُوبٌ إِلَيْكَ [At thy service time
after time: Thou art feared, and petitioned, or
supplicated with humility, &c.], it is in the nom.
case as the enunciative of an inchoative [أَنْتَ]
suppressed. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] المَرْهُوبُ, as also
↓ الرَّاهِبُ, [the latter in this case being like رَاضٍ
in the sense of مَرْضِىٌّ,] The lion. (K.)
