رجع1
رَجَعَ, aor.
رَجِعَ, inf. n. رُجُوعٌ (S, Msb, K, &c.)
and رَجْعٌ, (M, Msb,) but the former is that which
commonly obtains and is agreeable with analogy
as inf. n. of the intrans. v., and the latter as inf. n.
of the trans. v., (MF, TA,) and مَرْجَعٌ, (S, Msb,
K, &c.,) which is anomalous, because inf. ns. [of
this kind] of verbs of the measure فَعَلَ having the
aor. of the measure يَفْعِلُ are [by rule] only with
fet-h [to the medial radical], (S, K,) and مَرْجِعَةٌ,
which is in like manner anomalous, (K,) and
رُجْعَى, (S, Msb, K,) [not رُجْعًى as in the Lexicons
of Golius and Freytag,] and رُجْعَانٌ, (K,) He
returned; he went, or came, back [to the same
place, or person, or (assumed tropical:)  state, or (assumed tropical:)  occupation, or
(assumed tropical:)  action, or (assumed tropical:)  saying, &c.]; he reverted; contr. of
ذَهَبَ; (ISk, Msb;) i. q. انْصَرَفَ: (K:) رُجُوعٌ
signifies the returning to a former place, or
(assumed tropical:)  quality, or (assumed tropical:)  state; (Kull p. 196;) the returning
to that from which was the commencement, or
from which the commencement is supposed to have
been, whether it be a place, or (assumed tropical:)  an action, or (assumed tropical:)  a
saying, and whether the returning be by the
[whole] person or thing, or by a part thereof, or
by an action thereof. (Er-Rághib.) Hence the
saying in the Kur [lxiii. 8], لَئِنْ رَجَعْنَا إِلَى المَدِينَةِ
[Verily if we return to the city]. (Er-Rághib.)
And [in the same, xii. 63,] فَلَمَّا رَجَعُوا إِلَى أَبِيهِمْ
[And when they returned to their father].
(Idem.) And in the same, [vi. 164, and xxxix.
9,] ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّكُمْ مَرْجِعُكُمْ [Then unto your Lord
shall be your return]: (S:) the like of which
occurs in the same, vi. 60: but it may be either
from [the intrans. inf. n.] رُجُوعٌ or from [the
trans.] رَجْعٌ: (Er-Rághib:) it cannot be a n. of
place, because it is made trans. by means of إِلَى,
and also because it occurs in the Kur [v. 53, &c.],
followed by جَمِيعًا, as a denotative of state: (L:)
in like manner الرُّجْعَى also occurs in the Kur
xcvi. 8. (TA.) You say also, رَجَعَتِ المَرْأَةُ إِلَى
أَهْلِهَا The woman returned to her family by
reason of the death of her husband or by reason
of divorcement. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  رَجَعَ إِلَى الصِّحَّةِ

-b7-  رَجَعَ عَنِ

the Kur iii. 65, &c. (Er-Rághib.) ―
-b8-  [Several
other phrases, in which this verb occurs, will be
found in other arts.: as رَجَعَ عَلَى ظَهْرِهِ in art.

him, or it.] ―
-b13-  رَجَعَ بِهِ عَلَى شَرِيكِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He made a
claim for restitution of it upon his co-partner.

you say,] عَلَى الغَرِيمِ ↓ اِرْتَجَعَ, and المُتَّهَمِ, (assumed tropical:)  He sued,
prosecuted, or made a demand upon, the debtor,
and the suspected, for his right, or due. (TA:

-b14-  رَجَعَ الكَلْبُ فِى قَيْئِهِ The

thing which he had given to him. (S, K.) ―

retracted, or revoked, his saying, and his judgment, or sentence.] ―
-b17-  هُوَ يَرْجِعُ إِلَى مَنْصِبِ صِدْقٍ
(assumed tropical:)  He traces back his lineage to an excellent origin.
(TA in art. نصب.) ―
-b18-  [يَرْجِعُ إِلَى مَعْنَى كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  It
(a word used in a certain sense) is referrible, or
reducible, to such a meaning. And يُرْجِعُ إِلَى كَذَا,
said of a word, also means (assumed tropical:)  It relates to such a
thing; i. e., to such another word, in grammatical
construction.] ―
-b19-  رَجَعَ إِلَى قَدْرِ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  It (wine

quantity [so that it returned to the height of the

-b21-  ↓ رِجَاعٌ,
also, is an inf. n. of this verb, (L,) and is used as
signifying The returning of birds after their
migrating to a hot country. (S, L, K.) You say,
رَجَعَتِ الطَّيْرُ القَوَاطِعُ, inf. n. رِجَاعٌ and رَجْعٌ,
The migratory birds returned. (L.) ―
-b22-  Also
inf. n. of رَجَعَتْ said of a-she camel, and of a she-ass, signifying (assumed tropical:)  She raised her tail, and compressed her two sides (قُطْرَيْهَا), and cast forth her
urine in repeated discharges, so that she was
imagined to be pregnant, (S, K,) and then failed
of fulfilling her [apparent] promise: (S: [in
some copies of which, as is said in the TA, the
inf. n. of the verb in this sense is written رُجُوع:])
or she conceived, and then failed of fulfilling her
promise; because she who does so goes back from
what is hoped of her: (TA:) or, said of a she-camel, she cast forth her fœtus in an imperfect
state: (AZ, TA,) or, as some say, her embryo
in a fluid state: (TA:) or in an unformed state;
inf. n. رِجَاعٌ. (Msb in art. خدج.) [See also
رَاجِعٌ, below.]
-A2- , (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. رَجَعَهُ,
(Mgh,) inf. n. رَجْعٌ and مَرْجَعٌ and مَرْجِعٌ, (K,)
He made, or caused, him, or it, to return, go

back, or returned, him, or it; syn. رَدَّهُ; (Mgh,

thing; and إِلَيْهِ to it; (Msb, K;) as also ↓ ارجعهُ;
(S, Msb, K;) but the former is the more chaste
word, and is that which is used in the Kur-án, in
ix. 84 [and other places]: (Msb:) the latter is of
the dial. of Hudheyl; (S, Msb;) and is said by
MF to be of weak authority, and bad; but [SM
says,] I do not find this asserted by any of the
leading authorities: (TA:) ↓ ارتجعهُ, also, signifies [the same, i. e.] the same as رَدَّهُ in like
manner followed by إِلَى. (TA.) Thus in the
Kur ix. 84, referred to above, فَإِنْ رَجَعَكَ اللّٰهُ
[And if God make thee to return, or restore
thee]. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  رَجَعَ فُلَانٌ عَلِى أَنْفِ بَعِيِرهِ Such

رَجِعَ, inf. n. رَجْعٌ and رُجْعَانٌ, He

same: (S, K:) or رَجْعٌ signifies a beast's elevating,

going. (KL.) You say, الدَّابَّةُ يَدَيْهَا فِى ↓ رَجَّعَتِ

[upon the skin]: (S, K: *) [or rather, as the
former phrase is explained in the EM p. 143,
“ her retracing ” those marks or lines, and
renewing their blackness; for] you say also,
النَقْشَ ↓ رَجَّعَ, and الوَشْمَ, [and رَجَعَهُ,] (assumed tropical:)  He retraced
the marks, or lines, of the variegated work, and
of the tattooing, and renewed their blackness, one
time after another. (TA.) And الكِتَابَةَ ↓ رَجَّعَ,

(TA.) ―
-b7-  رَجَعَ نَاقَةً, and ↓ ارتجعها, and ↓ ترجّعها,

a she-camel with the price of a he-camel that he
sold; and ↓ رِجَعٌ, which is app. an inf. n., signifies
the selling males and purchasing females: (TA:)
or مَالًا ↓ ارتجع signifies he sold the aged and the
younglings of his came's, and purchased such as
were in a state of youthful vigour: or, as some
say, he sold the males, and purchased females:
(Lh:) or ↓ اِرْتِجَاعٌ signifies the selling a thing,
and purchasing in its place what one imagines to
be more youthful, and better: (Lh in another
place:) regard is bad, therein, to the meaning of
a return, virtual, or understood, though not real:
(Er-Rághib:) also إِبِلًا ↓ ارجع he sold old and
weak camels, and purchased such as were in a
state of youthful vigour: or he sold male camels,
and purchased females: (TA:) and إِبِلًا ↓ ارتجع
بِإِبِلِهِ he took camels in exchange for his camels:
or, as some say, ↓ اِرْتِجَاعٌ signifies the taking one

رجّعهُ, inf. n. تَرْجِيعٌ, He, or it, made, or

following.] ―
-b2-  See 1, last quarter of the paragraph, in five places. ―
-b3-  Hence, (Mgh,) التَّرْجِيعُ
فِى الأَذَانِ, (S, Mgh, K,) because the two professions of the faith [for which see the word أَذَانٌ]
are uttered in the اذان [or call to prayer] in a low
voice [and then repeated in a high voice]; (Mgh;)
[for] this phrase means (tropical:)  The repeating the two
professions of the faith in a raised, or loud,
voice, after uttering them in a low, or faint,
voice; (Sgh, K, TA;) or the lowering of the
voice in the اذان in uttering the two professions
of the faith, and then raising it in uttering them:
(KT:) or رجّع فِى أَذَانِهِ signifies he uttered the
two professions of the faith in his اذان once to
repeat them. (Msb: [but this is a strange explanation; and probably corrupted by a copyist:
it seems that, instead of “ to repeat them,” we
should read “ and repeated them. ”]) ―
-b4-  [Hence
also,] التَّرْجِيعُ, (K, TA,) or تَرْجِيعُ الصَّوْتِ, (S,)
(assumed tropical:)  [The act of quavering, or trilling; rapidly

each note of a piece; a general characteristic of
Arabian chanting and singing and piping, and

the throat, or fauces, (S, K, TA,) like [as is
done in] chanting, (S,) or which is practised in
reading or reciting, or singing, or piping, or other
performances, of such as are accompanied with
quavering, or trilling: (TA:) or, as some say,
the mutual approximation of the various kinds of
movements in the voice: 'Abd-Allah Ibn-Mughaffal, in his ترجيع, by the prolonging of the
voice, in reading, or reciting, imitated the like of
آا آا آا. (TA.) You say also, رجّع الحَمَامُ فِى

راجع also signifies He restored, or brought back,
anything.] ―

bringing bad camels into the market and taking
back good ones: or, as some say, the [return
obtained by] bringing in males and taking back
females: (TA:) [the words which I have here
twice inserted in brackets are perhaps not necessary to complete the sense intended, as will be
seen at the close of this sentence; but they seem
to be required in the opinion of SM, for he has
immediately added the further explanation which
here next follows, and which is also, but less
fully, given by J, immediately after the first
explanation in this paragraph:] and رِجْعَةٌ has a
similar meaning in relation to the poor-rates;
being applied to camels taken by the collector of

become many? ” and they answered, أَوْصَانَا أَبُونَا
بِالنُّجَعِ وَالرُّجَعِ: but Th says, ↓ بالنِّجَعِ والرِّجَعِ:
[both are probably correct; for it seems that the
original forms are النُّجَع and الرِّجَع; and that, in
one case, the latter is assimilated to the former;
in the other, accord. to a usage less common, the
former to the latter:] accord. to Th, the meaning
is, [Our father charged us with the seekings
after herbage in the places thereof, and] the
selling the old and weak beasts and purchasing
others in a state of youthful vigour: or, accord.
to another explanation, the meaning is, the selling
males and purchasing females: thus explained,
