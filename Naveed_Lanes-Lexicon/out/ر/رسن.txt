former it is merely indicated that the two verbs
signify the same:]) or the former verb [in the

[or a horse (see 1)] is led: (TA:) and such of
the [reins, or leading-ropes, termed] أَزِمَّة [pl. of

such a زِمَام as is upon a nose: (K:) pl. أِرْسَانٌ
(S, M, Msb, K) and أَرْسُنٌ, (M, Msb, K,) [both
properly pls. of pauc.,] and sometimes they said
رُسُنٌ; (Msb;) or, accord. to Sb, it has no other
pl. than أَرْسَانٌ; (M, Msb;) [but perhaps he
meant of pauc., for SM says,] Sb disallowed
أَرْسُنٌ. (TA.) A poet says, (S,) namely, Ibn-Mukbil, (TA,)
هَرِيتٌ قَصِيرُ عِذَارِ الِلّجَامِ
أَسِيلٌ طَوِيلُ عِذَارِ الرَّسّنْ
[Wide-mouthed, short in the cheek-straps of the
bridle (or headstall): smooth and long in the
cheek, long in the appertenance of the halter corresponding to the cheek-straps of the bridle or
headstall; because this appertenance is longer
than are the cheek-straps of the bridle or headstall]. (S, TA.) مّرَّ الصَّعَالِيكِ بِأَرْسَانِ الخَيْلِ [As
the passing along of the robbers with the halters
of the horses] is a prov., applied to an affair, or
event, that is quick and uninterrupted. (TA.)
And one says, رَمَى بِرَسَنِهِ عَلَى غَارِبِهِ [He threw
his leading-rope upon his withers], meaning (assumed tropical:)  he
left his way free, or open, to him; so that God
did not withhold him from that which he desired
to do. (TA.) ―

[both of which names are applied to the inula
helenium, common inula, or elecampane; also
called in the present day زَنْجَبِيلٌ شَامِىٌّ;] a Pers.
word [arabicized]. (K.)
مَرْسِنٌ (S, M, K) and مَرْسَنٌ, (M, K,) or the
latter should be مِرْسَنٌ, [but I think this doubtful,] thus written in some of the copies of the
S, and in both ways in the L, (TA,) The part,
of the nose of the horse, which is the place of the
رَسَن: (S:) or the nose of a solid-hoofed animal:
this is the primary signification: (M:) then, by a
secondary application, (S, M,) the nose (S, M, K)
in an absolute sense, (M, K,) or, of a human
being: (S:) pl. مَرَاسِنُ (TA) [which, as stated
by Freytag, is used in a sing. sense, in the
Deewán of Jereer, as meaning the nose]. سَلِسُ
المَرْسِنِ, a phrase used by the poet El-Jaadee,
means (assumed tropical:)  Easy to be led, tractable, or compliant.
(TA.) And you say, فَعَلْتُ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى رَغْمِ مَرْسِنِهِ

or notwithstanding his dislike, or disapproval, or
hatred; like as you say, عَلَى رَغْمِ أَنْفِهِ]. (S.)
مَرْسُونٌ A horse [or the like] tied with the
رسن: (S:) [or having a رَسَن bound upon him or
attached to him, or made for him: see 1.] You
say, أَجْرَرْتُ المَرْسُونَ رَسَنَهُ I made the haltered
beast to drag his halter. (TA.)
المَرْسِينُ [The myrtle-tree;] i. q. رَيْحَانُ القُبُورِ:
of the dial. of Egypt. (TA.) [Also mentioned in
art. مرس: for some hold the م to be augmentative; and some, the ن.]
