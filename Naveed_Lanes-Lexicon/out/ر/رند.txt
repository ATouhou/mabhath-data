رندرَنْدٌ [a coll. gen. n.] A kind of tree of sweet
odour, (AO, T, S, A, Msb, K,) which distils much
(سَيَّالٌ); (A;) of the trees of the desert; (AO, T,
S, A, Msb;) a kind of tree of the desert, of sweet
odour, with the wood of which the teeth are
cleaned; not large; and having a berry; (حَبَّة);
called [i. e., the tree is called, and not the berry,
for the verb is masculine,] غار [a name commonly
and properly applied to the laurus nobilis, or
sweet bay]: n. un. رَنْدَةٌ: (M:) or the myrtle (آس);
(M, A;) this is also called رند, (Kh, Msb, K,)
on account of its sweet odour; (Kh, Msb;) and
Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà says that the رند is the آس
accord. to all the lexicologists except Aboo- 'Amr
Esh-Sheybánee and IAar, who assert that the
رند is the plant called حَنْوَة, and is of sweet odour;
but AO also denies it to be the آس; (T;) and so
does As: (S:) or aloes-wood, (عُود,) with which one
fumigates; (M;) عود (or عُودُ الطِّيبِ, with which
one fumigates, AO, and T,) is also thus called,
(AO, As, T, S, K,) sometimes: (AO, As, T, S:)
[and accord. to Forskål, (Flor. Aeg. Ar., cxix.,)
the artemisia pontica bears this name.]
