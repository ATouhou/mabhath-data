think to be a mistranscription,]) said of a man:
mentioned in the T as on the authority of IAar.

say أَمْرٌ رَاتِبٌ A thing, or an affair, continual, or
uninterrupted, (دَارٌّ.) constant, firm, steady, &c.:
and ↓ أَمْرٌ تُرْتَبٌ, the latter word of the measure

not to be, or to do, thus constantly; as also
رَاتِمًا; in which, IJ says, the م is app. a substitute

وَكَانَ لَنَا فَضْلٌ عَلَى النَّاسِ تُرْتَبَا
meaning [And we possessed excellence above the
people] all together: (M, TA:) thus accord. to
the reading commonly known: but, as some
relate it,
وَكَانَ لَنَا حَقًّا عَلَى النَّاسِ تُرْتَبَا
i. e. [And it was a just claim that we had upon
the people,] settled, or established. (TA.) The
first ت in تُرْتَبٌ is augmentative, because there is
no word like جُعْفَرٌ; and the derivation also is an
evidence of this, for the word is from الشَّىْءُ الرَّاتِبُ.
(M.)
-A2-  Also the second of these three words,
(T in art. ترب, and M, and L,) or the first of
them, (K,) A bad slave: (T, K:) or a slave

right reading may perhaps be آبِدٌ, i. e. remaining

a road, to tread it. (K, * TA.)
