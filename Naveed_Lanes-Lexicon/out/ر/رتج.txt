رتج1
رَتَجَ, inf. n. رَتْجٌ: see 4.
-A2-  رَتِجَ, (K,) or
رَتِجَ فِى مَنْطِقَهِ, (S, A, Msb,) aor.
رَتَجَ, (Msb, K,)
inf. n. رَتَجٌ, (Msb, TA,) (tropical:)  He was, or became,
impeded in his speech, unable to speak, or tonguetied; (S, A, * Msb, K;) as also عَلَيْهِ ↓ أُرْتِجَ, (A,
K,) and عليه ↓ اُرْتُتِجَ, and عليه ↓ اُسْتُرْتِجَ. (K.)
You say, عَلَى القَارِىءِ ↓ أُرْتِجَ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) and
على الخَطِيبِ, (Mgh,) (tropical:)  The reader, or reciter,
(S, Mgh, Msb,) and the orator, or preacher,
(Mgh,) was unable to read, or recite, (S, Msb,)
as though he were prevented doing so, (Msb,)
or as though a thing were closed against him
like as a door is closed; (S;) or was, or became,
impeded in his reading, or recitation, and his
oration, or sermon, and unable to complete it;
(Mgh;) from أَرْتَجَ البَابَ: (Mgh, Msb: [see 4:])
and عَلَيْهِ ↓ اُرْتُتِجَ signifies the same: (S: [in my
copy of the Msb, “ارتيج, of the same measure as
اقتيل, in the pass. form: ” but this is evidently a
mistranscription, for اُرْتُتِجَ, of the same measure
as اُقْتُتِلَ:]) one should not say اُرْتُجَّ عليه: (S:
[but it seems that those who pronounced the verb
with teshdeed said اِرْتَجَّ: see art. رج:]) this is
sometimes said; but some disallow it: (Msb:)
the vulgar say it; and accord. to some, it may be
correct as meaning “ he fell into confusion. ”
(Mgh.) You say also, عَلَيْهِ ↓ صَعِدَ المِنْبَرَ فَأُرْتِجَعَلَى
(tropical:)  He ascended the pulpit, and was, or became,

ارتج البَابَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n.
إِرْتَاجٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ رَتَجَهُ, (K,) inf. n. رَتْجٌ;
but As allows only the former verb; (TA;) i. q.
أَغْلَقَهُ, [which means He locked the door, and
also he shut, or closed, the door, but the former
appears to be the signification here intended,
from what follows,] (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) so as
to make it fast, or firm: (A, Mgh, Msb:) so
says Az, after Lth: and, by extension of the
signification, he shut, or closed, the door, without
locking it. (Mgh.) It is said in a trad., إِنَّ أَبْوَابَ
السَّمَآءِ تُفْتَحُ عِنْدَ زَوَالِ الشَّمْسِ فَلَا تُرْتَجُ حَتَّى يُصَلَّى
