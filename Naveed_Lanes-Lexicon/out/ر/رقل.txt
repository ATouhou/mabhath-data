ارقلت, said of a palm-tree (نَخْلَة), inf. n.
إِرْقَالٌ, It became such as is termed رَقْلَة [q. v.].
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  ارقل, (S, K,) said of a he-camel, (S,)
or ارقلت, said of a she-camel, (JK, Msb, TA,)
inf. n. as above, (JK, S, Msb,) He, or she, went
quickly; (JK, K;) went a sort of quick pace;
(Msb;) went a sort of pace of the kind termed
خَبَب [q. v.]: (S, TA:) or went a sort of run
exceeding that termed خَبَب: (TA:) and ↓ رَقَلَتْ
signifies the same as ارقلت. (JK.) ارقل is also
said of a man, (S, K,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  He went
quickly. (TA.) And you say, ارقلوا فِى الحَرْبِ,
(TA,) or إِلَى الحَرْبِ, (JK,) (tropical:)  They went quickly
in, or to, war, or battle. (JK, TA.) And فُلَانٌ
يُرْقِلُ فِى الأُمُورِ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one is quick in affairs].
(TA.) And أَرْقَلَتْ إِلَيْهِ is metaphorically said, by
Aboo-Heiyeh En-Numeyree, of spears [as meaning (tropical:)  They had been quickly directed towards
him]. (TA.)
-A2-  Accord. to Lth and the K, ارقل
also signifies He traversed, or crossed, a desert:
and Lth cites the following verse of El-'Ajjáj [as
his authority for this explanation]:
لَاهُمَّ رَبِّ البَيْتِ وَالمُشَرَّقِ
وَالمُرْقِلَاتِ كُلَّ سُهْبٍ سَمْلَقِ
but Az says that this is a mistake of Lth; that
كُلَّ is here an adv. n.; and that the meaning is,
[O God, by the Lord of the House (of Mekkeh)
and of the Musharrak (the mosque of El-Kheyf)
and] by the Lord of the swift she-camels in every
even plain: and ISd also has notified the same.
(TA.)

رَقْلَةٌ A tall palm-tree: (S, Msb:) or a palmtree exceeding the reach of the hand; (K, * TA;)

word, a palm-tree higher than such as [just]
exceeds the reach of the hand: (TA:) or a palmtree of which the trunk has become such as that
one may reach [the fruit] from [the top of] it:

is a n. un. (Msb.) Hence the prov.,
وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ بِالدَّخْلِ  ↓تَرَى الفِتْيَانَ كَالرَّقْلِ
[Thou seest the youths, or young men, like tall
palm-trees, &c.; but what will acquaint thee with
the vice, &c., that is, or may be, in them?]. (TA.
[See also another reading of this verse voce
دَخْلٌ.]) [And رَوَاقِلُ, pl. of ↓ رَاقِلٌ, as used by a
Hudhalee poet, applied to the trunks of palmtrees, signifies Tall. (“ Abulfedæ Annales,”
vol. i. page 494.)]
