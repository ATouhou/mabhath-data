رَذَذٌ: see what next follows.
رَذَاذٌ, (T, S, M, A, L, K,) and by poetic license
↓ رَذَذٌ, (M, L,) Weak [or drizzling] rain, (S, M,
L, K,) but exceeding what is termed قِطْقِط:
(S, L:) or fine rain, but exceeding what is termed
طَلّ: (A:) or the lightest of rain except what is
termed طَلّ: (As, T:) or, accord. to El-Khattábee,
and Suh in the R, rain more than what is termed
طَشّ and بَغْش, but a little less strong than what
is termed طَلّ, or like this last: (MF, TA:) or
still, continuous rain, consisting of small drops,
resembling dust: or such as is after [app. meaning more than] what is termed طَلّ: (M, L, K:)
n. un. رَذَاذَةٌ. (M.) To such rain, the poet Bakhdaj, using the abbreviated form of the word,
likens some of his verses; not as meaning weak,
but as meaning continuous, or uninterrupted, and
unruffled; while he likens others of his verses to
rain such as is termed وَابِل. (M.) One says,
يَوْمُنَا يَوْمُ رَذَاذٍ وَسُرُورٍ وَالْتِذَاذٍ [Our day is a day of
fine rain, &c., and of happiness, and of delectation]. (A.) ―

بِرَذَاذِ نَيْلِكَ وَرَشَاشِ سَيْلِكَ (tropical:)  [We are content with a
little of what is obtained of thy bounty, and
with the sprinkling of thy torrent of munificence]. (A.)

ارض مُرَذَّةٌ (Ks, T, S, M) and ↓ مَرْذُوذَةٌ, (Th, M,
K,) or the second and third of these are not

M,) Land upon which has fallen rain such as is
termed رَذَاذ. (As, A 'Obeyd, T, S, M, K.)
مُرِذٌّ A sky (سَمَآءٌ) raining, or letting fall, such
rain as is termed رَذَاذ; and so مَرِذَّةٌ. (A, TA.)

[The sky is raining a fine rain, and what is being
heard is delighting: art thou, then, coming to us
