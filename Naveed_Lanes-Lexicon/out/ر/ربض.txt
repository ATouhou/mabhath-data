رَبِضَ, (S, Msb, K,)
inf. n. رُبُوضٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and رَبْضٌ
(Msb, K) and رَبْضَةٌ, (K,) [the last an inf. n. of
un.,] said of the sheep and goat, (S, A, Mgh, K,)
and of the gazelle, (S, A,) and of the ox-kind,
and the horse, (S,) or beast, (Msb,) and of the
dog, (S, A,) [signifying He lay down, or laid
himself down, upon his breast,] is like بَرَكَ said of
a camel, (S, Msb, K,) and جَثَمَ said of a bird, (S,
TA,) or جَلَسَ said of a man. (Mgh.) Said of a
man, it means [(assumed tropical:)  He lay down: and he sat: or]
he sat upon his knees: and it may also mean he
sat upon his thighs and his buttocks. (Har p. 172.)
[And hence, (assumed tropical:)  He remained fixed, or stationary,
like an animal lying upon its breast; as is shown
by what here follows: whence a signification of
رَبَّضَ, q. v.] The saying of Mohammad to Ed-
Dahhák, when he sent him to his people, إِذَا
أَتَيْتَهُمْ فَارْبِضْ فِى دَارِهِمْ ظَبْيًا, means When thou
comest to them, remain in their abode in security,
or without fear, like the gazelle in his covert:
(IAar, ISd, K:) or trust them not, but be vigilant, like a wild animal, ready to spring up, for
thou wilt be in the midst of the unbelievers;
(Az, ISd, K; *) so, if anything induce in thee
suspicion, thou mayest flee from them like the
gazelle: (Az, ISd, TA:) accord. to each interpretation, ظبيا is in the accus. case as a denotative of
state; the subst. being put in the place of the act.
part. n., as though for مَتَظَبِّيًا: the former of the
two explanations is said to be the more agreeable
with the circumstances of the case. (TA.) You
say also, رَبَضَ الأَسَدُ عَلَى فَرِيسَتِهِ, and القِرْنُ عَلَى
قِرْنِهِ, The lion laid himself down upon his breast
(بَرَكَ) on his prey, and the adversary on his
adversary. (K.) ―
-b2-  He (a beast) lodged, and
abode, in a place. (TA.) ―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  He (a man) became heavy, and slept, stretched upon the ground.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  رَبَضَ عَنِ الغَنَمِ, (S, A, K,) inf. n. رُبُوضٌ,
(S,) (tropical:)  He (a ram) abstained from tupping, or
covering the ewes, and avoided it, (S, A, * K, *) or
them, (TA,) being fatigued: (S:) or was unable
to cover them: (K:) one does not say, of a ram,
جَفَرَ. (S.) You say also of a ewe when she is
pregnant, قَدْ رُبِضَ عَنْهَا. (Ibn- 'Abbád, A.) And
you say of a man, رَبَضَ عَنْ مَعَالِى الأُمُورِ (assumed tropical:)  He abstained, or held back, from seeking the means of
acquiring eminence, or nobility. (TA.) ―
-b5-  رَبَضَ

itself (expl. by أَلْقَى بنَفْسِهِ) upon the earth]. (K.)
-A2-  رَبَضَهُ, aor.
رَبِضَ and
رَبُضَ, (IAar, O, K,) but the
latter aor. was afterwards rejected by IAar, (TA,)
He betook himself, or repaired, to him for
lodging, covert, or refuge. (IAar, O, K.)
-A3-
رَبَضَتْهُ, aor.
رَبِضَ, and IAar is related to have said
رَبُضَ
also, but afterwards to have retracted it, (tropical:)  She (a
wife, or sister, or other woman,) undertook, or
managed, his affairs, and gave him lodging, or
refuge: (TA:) she was to him [as though she
were] a رَبَض, or place of abode: like أَبَوْتُهُ “ I
was to him a father,” and أَمَمْتُهُ “ I was to him
a mother. ” (A, TA.) [The aor. occurs in the
K, in the phrase تَرْبِضُ زَوْجَهَا: thus in the TA:
in the CK, تُرَبِّضُ: in the L, تَرْبُضُ; and thus also
the aor. is written in a copy of the A.]

bottom: (K, * TA:) mentioned by Sgh, from
Ibn- 'Abbád. (TA.)
4
اربض He made a sheep, or goat, [&c., (see

-b2-  أَرْبَضَهُمْ (tropical:)  It (a
vessel, S, A, K, and beverage, or wine, A, TA)
satisfied their thirst so that they became heavy,
and slept, stretched upon the ground: (S, * A, *
K:) (tropical:)  it (milk) satiated them. (TA.) ―
-b3-  اربضت
الشَّمْسُ (tropical:)  The sun became vehemently hot, (S, A,
K,) so as to make the gazelle and the sheep or
goat, (S,) or the wild animals, (A,) to lie down
upon their breasts: (S, A:) or became still, like
a beast lying upon its breast, having attained its
utmost height and not begun to descend. (O.) ―
-b4-
اربض أَهْلَهُ, (O, K,) and أَصْحَابَهُ, (O,) (assumed tropical:)  He

kinds called طَلْح and سَمُر: (K:) or a collection
of abundant and dense trees. (TA.)
رِبْضٌ: see رَبِيضٌ: in three places.
رَبَضٌ The lodging-place of sheep or goats;
(S, A, * K;) because they lie therein upon their
breasts; and in like manner of wild animals:
(TA:) the nightly lodging-place of sheep or
goats: (Msb:) and ↓ مَرْبِضٌ signifies the same:
(S, * A, Mgh, Msb:) pl. of the former أَرْبَاضٌ: (S,
A, * TA:) and of the latter مَرَابِضُ: (S, K: *) the
مرابض of sheep or goats are like the مَعَاطِن of
camels. (S.) ―
-b2-  (tropical:)  A place of abode: a place of
abode of a people by itself: (A, TA:) pl. as
above. (A.) ―
-b3-  (tropical:)  Anything to which a man
betakes himself, or repairs, for lodging, covert,
or refuge, (ISk, S, A, * Msb, K,) and at which,
or with which, he finds rest, or ease; (K;) such
as a house or tent, (S, A, K,) and the like, (S, K,)
and a wife, (ISk, S, A, Msb,) or relations, (ISk,
A, Msb,) or a family, and a relation, and
property, (K,) and sheep or goats, and means of
subsistence, and food; (TA;) and hence, (S,)
milk which sustains a man, and suffices him for
food: (S, K: *) pl. as above: (K:) رَبَضٌ and
↓ رَبْضٌ and ↓ رُبْضٌ (IAar, Sgh, K) and ↓ رُبُضٌ
(K) are applied to a wife لِأَنَّهَا تَرْبِضُ زَوْجَهَا, (so
in copies of the K and in the TA, but in the CK
تُرَبِّضُ,) i. e. because she undertakes, or manages,
the affairs of her husband, and gives him lodging,
or refuge; (TA;) or because she fixes him,
(تُرَبِّضُهُ, i. e. تُثَبِّتُهُ,) so that he does not quit his
place: (L, TA:) or to the mother; or the sister;
who undertakes, or manages, the affairs of (تُعَزِّبُ
[so in copies of the K and in the TA, in the
latter of which it is thus explained, but in the CK
تُقَرِّبُ,]) her relation. (K.) A poet says,
جَآءَ الشِّتَآءُ وَلَمَّا أَتَّخِذْ رَبَضًا
يَا وَيْحَ كَفَّىَّ مِنْ حَفْرِ القَرَامِيصِ
(S, Mgh) i. e. [The winter has come, and I have
not yet made for myself] a lodging: [O, wo to
my two-hands, in consequence of digging] hollows
in which to sit for protection from the cold.
(Mgh.) And from رَبَضٌ applied to “ milk which
sustains a man, and suffices him for food,” originated the prov., (K, TA,) مِنْكَ رَبَضُكَ وَإِنْ كَانَ
سَمَارًا, meaning (tropical:)  Thy family and thy servants
(S, K) and those to whom thou betakest thyself
for lodging or refuge, (S,) are appertenances of
thine, though they be persons falling short [of
their duty]: (S, K:) or thy manager of affairs,
&c., though he be not a good manager of thine
affairs: (L, TA:) and رَبَضٌ also signifies any
woman who undertakes, or manages, the affairs
of a house: but in the T we find ↓ رُبْضُكَ, thus
written, as by Th, on the authority of IAar, but
not restricted by a measure, and explained as
meaning the person who undertakes, or manages,
the affairs of thy house; and so in the book of
proverbs by As: and in the margin of a copy of
the S, we find the above-cited prov. thus written,
وَإِنْ كَانَ سَمَارًا ↓ مِنْكَ رُبُضُكَ, as from the “ Book
on Goats ” by Ibn-Zeyd, and expl. as meaning
the sons of thy father are appertenances of thine,
though they be evil persons, in whom is no good.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  (tropical:)  The wall of a city: (K, TA:) the
environs of a city, (S, A, Mgh,) and of a قَصْر [or
palace &c.], (A,) consisting of houses or dwellings,
(A, Mgh,) or of open country: (TA:) and ↓ رُبْضٌ
signifies the same: (TA:) or this latter signifies
the foundation, or basis, of a building; and of a
city also: (K:) IKh writes it ↓ رُبُضٌ: and some
say that ↓ رُبْضٌ and رَبَضٌ signify the same: (TA:)
the former of these two signifies also the part, of
a thing, that touches the ground: (K, TA:) so says
Sh: accord. to ISh, الأَرْضِ ↓ رُبْضُ signifies what
touches the ground, of a thing: (TA:) and رَبَضٌ
also signifies a lateral, or an outward or adjacent,
part: (K:) or lateral, or outward or adjacent,
parts of a thing: (Ks, S:) also the space immediately pertaining to a mosque: and [the pl.]
أَرْبَاضٌ is explained by El-Karkhee as applied to
the quarters, or districts, of a town, or city.
(Mgh.) ―
-b5-  رَبَضٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The rope of the
[camel's saddle called] رَحْل, (A, K,) with which
the رحل is bound; (A, TA;) one of the أَرْبَاض,
or ropes of the رَحْل: (S, A:) or the part that is
next the ground thereof; (K;) i. e., of the rope
of the رحل; (TA;) not what is above the رحل:
(K:) accord. to Lth, the part [of the belly] of
the camel that is next the ground when he lies
down; (L, TA; *) and the belly of the she-camel;
and in like manner IAar explains the pl. أَرْبَاضٌ
as meaning the bellies of camels; but Az says that
this is a mistake. (TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  A girth of a
رَحْل, like the نِطَاق [q. v.], which is put upon the
flanks of the she-camel, so as to have the haunches
behind it, (K, TA,) on either side, having at its
two ends two rings, to which are tied the [woven,
or plaited, thongs called] أَنْسَاع: the رحل is bound
with it. (TA.) ―
-b6-  Also (tropical:)  The مَصَارِين [or guts,
or intestines,] of the belly, that have a winding,
or coiled, form; (Lth, A, TA;) such as are in
the belly of a sheep or goat: (Lth, TA:) or the
folding intestines of beasts: (AHat, TA:) or the
guts, bowels, or intestines, into which the food
passes from the stomach; syn. أَمْعَآءٌ: (S, K:)
or the contents of the belly, (K, TA,) consisting
of the مَصَارِين &c., (TA,) except the heart (K,
TA) and the lungs. (TA.) (assumed tropical:)  The part that
comprises the حَوَايَا [or winding, circling, or
coiled, guts or intestines]; (IAar, TA;) as also
↓ رَبِيضٌ and ↓ مَرْبِضٌ and ↓ مَرْبَضٌ: (IAar, K,
TA:) some describe the رَبَض as below the navel;
and the ↓ مَرْبَض, as beneath the navel and above
the pubes. (TA.)
رُبُضٌ [(tropical:)  Holding back, through indolence].
رُبُضٌ عَنِ الحَاجَاتِ, (A, K,) in [some of] the
copies of the K, erroneously, عَلَى الحاجات,
(TA,) and الأَسْفَارِ, (A, TA,) means (tropical:)  A man who
does not rise to perform needful affairs, (A, K,)
and journeys: (A, TA:) or who does not go forth
to undertake them. (Lh, TA.)

رُبْضَةٌ, applied to a man, i q. ↓ مُتَرَبِّضٌ; (K;)

رِبْضَةٌ A mode, or manner, of lying upon the
breast: (K, and Har p. 382: [see 1, first signification:]) this is the primary meaning. (Har.)
―
-b2-  And A place thereof. (Har ibid. [See again
رَبَضٌ, first signification.]) ―
-b3-  See also رَبِيضٌ, in
three places. ―
-b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A place of slaughter
(مَقْتَل) of any party, or company of men, slain
in one plot of ground: (Lth, Sgh, K:) erroneously
written by Sgh in the TS رَبَضَة; but in the O
correctly. (TA.) [And accord. to the TA, it
seems to be also applied to (assumed tropical:)  The party so slain.]
-A2-  Also The body [of an animal] when lying
upon the breast; particularly, of a hare, (A, K,)
and of a lamb, (A, TA,) and of a she-goat;
and so ↓ رُبْضَةٌ. (TA.) Hence the saying, أَتَانَا
بِثَرِيدٍ كَأَنَّهُ رِبْضَةُ أَرْنَبٍ [He brought us crumbled
bread moistened with broth resembling in size and
shape the body of a hare lying upon its breast].
(A, K. *)
دَابَّةٌ ضَخْمَةُ الرَّبَضَةِ A beast of which the traces
of the place where it has been tied [and app.
where it has lain] are large, or wide. (TA.)

not at all, to be lifted; so that it remains fixed;
or so that it causes him who desires to lift it to
remain fixed. (A, TA.) ―
-b3-  Then, (A,) applied
to a tree (شَجَرَة), meaning (tropical:)  Great, or large,
(A 'Obeyd, S, A, * K,) and thick, (S,) and, accord.
to the K, wide, but [SM says,] I have not seen
that any of the leading authorities applies it in
this last sense to a tree: (TA:) pl. رُبَضٌ. (K.)
―
-b4-  Applied to a chain (سِلْسِلَة), (tropical:)  Large, or big,
(S, K, TA,) and heavy, cleaving to him upon

رَبِيضٌ Sheep, or goats, with their pastors, collected together in their lodging-places; (S, A,
K;) as though it were a quasi-pl. n.; as also
↓ رِبْضَةٌ and ↓ رِبْضٌ: (TA:) and hence, (L, TA,)
↓ the former of these two, (assumed tropical:)  a company of men:
(L, K:) and ↓ the latter of them, [accord. to the
K,] a herd of bulls, or cows, in their lodgingplace; from the author of the book entitled
كِتَابُ المُزْدَوِجِ مِنَ اللُّغَاتِ, only: (K, * TA:) but
what this author says is, that ↓ رِبْضٌ signifies the
lodging-places of bulls or cows [app. with the
beasts in them]: and that the primary application of this word (رِبْضٌ) and ↓ رِبْضَةٌ is to sheep or
goats; and that by a subsequent usage they have
been applied to bulls or cows and to men. (TA.)
See also رَابِضٌ. ―
-b2-  One says also, صَبَّ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ
حُمَّى رَبِيضًا [app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  May God send (lit.
pour) upon him a fever that shall cleave to him
like as an animal lying upon its breast cleaves
to the ground]. (TA.)
-A2-  See also رَبَضٌ, last
sentence.
رَبَّاضٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.
رَابِضٌ Lying upon his breast; applied to a
sheep or goat [&c.]; and so ↓ رَبُوضٌ applied to a
hare; so too ↓ رَبَّاضٌ [but app. in an intensive or
a frequentative sense] applied to a lion, as is also
رَابِضٌ, and to a man lying on his adversary:
(TA:) and [hence] ↓ الرَّبَّاضُ is an appellation of
the lion: (K:) the pl. [of رَابِضٌ] is رُبَّضٌ and
رُبُوضٌ: and the phrase الغَنَمِ ↓ كَرَبِيضَةِ, occurring in a trad., means كَالغَنَمِ الرُّبَّضِ [Like the
sheep, or goats, that are lying upon their breasts].
(TA.) It is said in a prov., كَلْبٌ جَوَّالٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ
أَسَدٍ رَابِضٍ or رَبَضَ [A dog that roams about is
better than a lion lying upon his breast or that
has laid himself down upon his breast]. (TA.) ―
-b2-
[Hence, because of his cleaving to the ground,]
(tropical:)  A sick man. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also the phrase,]
أَرْنَبَتُهُ رَابِضَةٌ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ (tropical:)  The end of his nose is
flat, and spreading upon his face. (A.) ―
-b4-
الرَّابِضَانِ is an appellation applied to The Turks
and the Abyssinians. (K, TA.) These are meant
in the trad. of Mo'áwiyeh, لَا تَبْعَثُوا الرَّابِضَيْنِ,
i. e. Rouse not ye against you the two [peoples]
that are remaining quiet as long as they do not
pursue you: it is like another trad., in which it
is said, اُتْرُكُوا التُّرْكَ مَا تَرَكُوكُمْ وَدَعُوا الحَبَشَةَ مَا
وَدَعُوكُمْ [Leave ye alone the Turks as long as
they leave you alone, and let ye alone the Abyssinians as long as they let you alone]. (TA.)
رَابِضَةٌ [as a subst. from رَابِضٌ, made so by the
affix ة, An animal lying upon its breast]. One
says of a man who kills when he shoots, and
more commonly of him who kills when he smites
with the [evil] eye, فُلَانٌ مَا تَقُومُ رَابِضَتُهُ [Such a
one is so effective in his aim that his animal lying
upon its breast does not rise]: (ISk, S, TA:) and
in like manner, مَا تَقُومُ لَهُ رَابِضَةٌ: it is a prov.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  It is said in a trad., فَانْبَعَثَ لَهُ وَاحِدٌ مِنَ
الرَّابِضَةِ [And there rose and went to him one of
the رَابضة]: (Lth, A, TA:) الرَّابِضَةُ means (tropical:)  certain
angels who were sent down [from Paradise] with
Adam, (Lth, A, K, TA,) who direct those that
err from the right way: (Lth, A, TA:) perhaps
(Lth, TA) so called from their remaining upon
the earth: (Lth, * A, TA: *) and [so in the K, but
correctly “ or,”] the remainder of the Bearers of
Evidence (حَمَلَةِ الحُجَّةِ [meaning those angels
whereof every individual of mankind has two
appointed to attend him constantly for the purpose of their bearing evidence of his good and
evil deeds, which two are termed in the Kur l. 16
المُتَلَقِّيَانِ,]) whereof the earth will never be destitute. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  And in another trad., respecting
the signs of the coming of the resurrection, the
Prophet is related to have said that one of those
signs will be, that the ↓ رُوَيْبِضَة will speak respecting the affairs of the community: (T, TA:)
الرُّوَيْبِضَةُ is the dim. of الرَّابِضَةُ (T, K, TA) signifying The pastor of رَبِيض [q. v.]; (T, TA;) and
means (assumed tropical:)  the mean, contemptible man, (S, K,) who
speaks respecting the affairs of the community:
thus expl. by the Prophet himself: (K: [in the
CK, النّاقِهُ is erroneously put for التَّافِهُ:]) or he
explained it as meaning (assumed tropical:)  the vitious, or wicked,
who speaks respecting the affairs of the community: A 'Obeyd compares this trad. with
another, in which it is said that one of the signs
above mentioned will be, that the pastors of
sheep or goats will be the heads of the people:
and Az says that الرويبضة means the pastor of
sheep or goats: some say that it means (assumed tropical:)  he who
abstains, or holds back, from seeking the means
of acquiring eminence, or nobility; and الرَّابِضَةُ
signifies [the same, or] impotent to attain eminence: in this latter, the ة is added to give
intensiveness to the signification: and Az thinks
it most probable that each of these is applied to
the mean man because of his remaining in his
house, or tent, and seldom rising and going forth
to occupy himself in great affairs. (TA.)
رُوَيْبِضَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
تِرْبَاضٌ i. q. عُصْفُرٌ [Safflower, or bastard saffron].
