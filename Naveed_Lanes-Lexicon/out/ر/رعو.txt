رعو1
رَعَا, aor. يَرْعُو, (S, TA,) [He refrained,
forbore, or abstained: or, used elliptically,] he
refrained, forbore, or abstained, (S, TA,) from
things, or affairs, (S,) or from ignorance, and
reverted therefrom in a good manner; (TA;) [as
also ↓ اِرْعَوَى; (K;) [for] رَعْوٌ and رِعْوٌ and رُعُوٌ (K)
and رَعْوَةٌ and رِعْوَةٌ (S, K) and رُعْوَةٌ (K) are syn.
with ↓ اِرْعِوَآءٌ (S, K) meaning the refraining, forbearing, or abstaining, from ignorance, and reverting therefrom in a good manner, (K, TA,) [all
app. as inf. ns.,] and so are ↓ رَعُوَى (S, K) and
↓ رُعْوَى (K) and ↓ رُعْيَا, (S, K,) [in the last of
which the radical و is changed into ى as it is in
دُنْيَا and عُلْيَا and قُصْيَا,] but these three, as some
say, (TA,) or the first and last of these three,
(S,) are simple substs.: (S, TA:) you say, فُلَانٌ
حَسَنُ الرَّعْوَةِ and الرِّعْوَةِ and ↓ الرَّعْوَى [&c., meaning Such a one is good in respect of refraining,
&c.]. (S.) ↓ اِرْعَوَى is of the measure اِفْعَلَلَ [for
اِفْعَلَّ]; the two infirm letters not being incorporated, one into the other, because the ى is
quiescent: (S: [see also Ham p. 220:]) you say,
عَنِ القَبِيحِ ↓ ارعوى, (S, Msb,) or عن الجَهْلِ,
(Ham ubi suprà,) He refrained, forbore, or
abstained, from bad, or foul, conduct, (S, Msb,)
or from ignorance, and reverted therefrom:
(Ham:) and ↓ ارعوى [alone] signifies He refrained, forbore, or abstained; and he repented:
(Har p. 240:) [see also an ex. in a verse cited
voce أَلَا:] accord. to AHei, it is quasi-pass. of
رَعَوْتُهُ. (TA.)
-A2-  [Hence, رَعَوْتُهُ app. signifies I
caused him to refrain, forbear, or abstain, &c.]
