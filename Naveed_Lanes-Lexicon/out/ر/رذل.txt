اِسْتَجَادَهُ. (O, K.) Hence the trad., مَا اسْتَرْذَلَ
اللّٰهُ عَبْدًا إِلَّا حَظَرَ عَنْهُ العِلْمَ وَالأَدَبَ [God desires

accord. to analogy,] and رُذُولٌ (S, M, K) and
رُذَالٌ, (M, K,) which is of a rare form, (M,) [in
the CK رُذّالٌ,] and رَذْلُونَ, (T,) [which is applied
only to rational beings,] and (of ↓ رَذِيلٌ, TA)
رُذَلَآءُ, (S, M, K,) and, of the pl. أَرْذُلٌ, (Msb,
[but] said in the O to be of [the pl.] أَرْذَالٌ, TA,)

in the place of أَرْذَالٌ,) and [of ↓ الأَرْذَلُ,] الأَرْذَلُونَ,
(T, M, K,) [which is applied only to rational

garment: and ↓ ثوب رَذِيلٌ a bad, or vile, garment. (T.)
رَذِلٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
رُذَالٌ: see رَذْلٌ [of which it is both a syn. and a

-b2-  Also, (S,) or ↓ رُذَالَةٌ, (T,) or both, (M,
Msb, K,) The worse or viler, or the worst or
vilest, (T,) or the bad, or vile, (S,) of anything:
(T, S:) [or the refuse thereof; i. e.] a thing of
which the good has been picked out, (M, Msb,
K,) and the bad or vile, (M,) or the worse or
viler, or worst or vilest, (Msb,) remains. (M,
Msb.) You say also, النَّاسِ ↓ هُمْ رُذَالَةُ and رُذَالُهُمْ

أَرْذَلُ: see رَذْلٌ, in two places. ―
-b2-  Also The
worse, or worst: so in the phrase أَرْذَلُ العُمُرِ [The
worse, or worst, part of life]. (O, K.) [In the
K, immediately after the words وَأَرْذَلَ صَارَ أَصْحَابُهُ
رُذَلَآءَ, we find, in some copies, وَرُذَالَى كَحُبَارَى
وَأَرْذَلُ العُمُرِ أَسْوَؤْهُ; and in other copies, وَرُذَالَى
كَحُبَارَى أَرْذَلُ العُمُرِ أَسْوَؤُهُ: accord. to the former
reading, the meaning is, that ↓ رُذَالَى is syn. with
رُذَلَآءُ; and such SM holds to be the case: accord.
to the latter reading, that رُذَالَى is syn. with
أَرْذَلُ العُمُرِ. I have no doubt that the latter is the
original reading in the K, and that it is taken
from the O, where (with a preceding context
different from that in the K) the words are,
وَرُذَالَى اَرذَلِ العُمُرِ اَسْوَؤُهُ; thus, with ارذل in the
gen. case: but I believe, as this word thus written
suggests, and as some persons, alluded to by MF,
have supposed, that كحبارى has been foisted
into the text of the K in consequence of a misunderstanding or of a mistranscription of the words
in question in some work earlier than the O;
that the correct reading is, وَرُدَّ إِلَى أَرْذَلِ العُمُرِ
أَسْوَئِهِ; and that this is taken from what here
follows.] It is said in the Kur [xvi. 72 and
xxii. 5], وَمِنْكُمْ مَنْ يُرَدُّ إِلَى أَرْذَلِ العُمُرِ, (T, TA,)
i. e. [And of you is he who is brought back to]
the worse, or worst, [part] of life, (Ksh and Bd
and Jel,) and the more, or most, contemptible
thereof; (Ksh in xvi. 72;) a state of decrepitude
and dotage; (Ksh and Bd and Jel;) which resembles the state of a young infant: (Ksh and
Bd:) meaning he who dotes by reason of old
age, so that he has no intellect; as is shown
by the words in the same [immediately following],
لِكَيْلَا يَعْلَمَ بَعْدَ عِلْمٍ شَيْئًا or مِنْ بَعْدِ عِلْمٍ شَيْئًا.
(T, TA. *)
مَرْذُولٌ A man made, or pronounced, to be low,
base, vile, mean, or contemptible: (S, * TA:) and
a thing made, or pronounced, to be bad, corrupt,
vile, base, abominable, or disapproved. (TA.)
