رمل1
رَمَلَ as syn. with رَمَّلَ: see the latter in two
places.

رَمْلٌ;] and ↓ ارملهُ; He wove (نَسَجَ, A 'Obeyd,
T, or سَفَّ, A 'Obeyd, S) the mat [of palm-leaves

the M, but in the K “ or ”] الحَصِيرَ, aor.
رَمُلَ, inf. n.
رَمْلٌ, He ornamented the couch, and the mat,

رَمَلَهُ, He made the weaving of the mat thin
(Har p. 55.) And رَمَلَ النَّسْجَ, (M, K,) aor. and
inf. n. as above; (TA;) and ↓ ارملهُ, and ↓ رمّلهُ;
(M, K; the last omitted in the TA;) He made
the woven thing, or the weaving, thin. (M, K.)
And رَمَلَ السَّرِيرَ, (S, K,) [aor. and] inf. n. as
above; (TA;) and ↓ ارملهُ; He wove (رَمَلَ) شَرِيط
[or palm leaves split and then plaited together],
(S, O, K,) or some other thing, (S, O,) and made
the same a back (جَعَلَهُ ظَهْرًا) to the couch. (S, O,
K. [What is here called the “ back ” of the
couch is app. so called as being likened to the
back of a beast on which one rides: see رُمَالٌ.])
Accord. to IKt, رَمَلْتُ السير [app. a mistranscription for السَّرِيرَ] and ↓ أَرْمَلْتُهُ signify I wove the
سير [or the سرير] with a شَرِيط of leaves, or fibres,
of the palm-tree. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] رَمَلْتُ القَوْلَ
and الوَصْفَ [(assumed tropical:)  I wove, i. e. composed, the saying
and the description]. (Phrases cited in the TA
from two modern poets.)
-A3-  رَمَلَ, (T, S, M, Mgh,
Msb, K,) aor.
رَمُلَ, (T, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. رَمَلَانٌ

and مَرْمَلٌ, (K,) said of a man, i. q. هَرْوَلَ [i. e.
He went a kind of trotting pace, between a walk
and a run]; (S, Mgh, Msb, K; [in the M said
to be “ less than المَشْىُ and above العَدْوُ; ” app.,
as is remarked in the TT, through inadvertence
of a writer;]) i. e. (TA) he was quick in his
manner of walking, (T, TA,) and shook his
shoulder-joints, (TA,) leaping, (so in the T accord. to the TT,) or not leaping, (so in the TA,)
in doing so; (T, TA;) while performing the
circuitings round the Kaabeh, (T, Mgh, TA,)
but only in some of those circuitings, exclusively
of others, (TA,) which one does in imitation of
the Prophet and his Companions, who did thus
in order that the people of Mekkeh might know
that there was in them strength; (T, TA;) and
in going between Es-Safà and El-Marweh. (S,
TA.) [It is also said of a camel: see رَتَكَ.]
-A4-

2
رمّلهُ, (M, TA,) inf. n. تَرْمِيلٌ, (TA,) He

TA;) and (TA) so ↓ رَمَلَهُ, (Ibn-'Abbád, K, TA,)

رَمُلَ, inf. n. رَمْلٌ; but the former verb is the more
chaste. (TA.) Hence, in a trad. respecting [the
eating of the flesh of] domestic asses, أَمَرَ أَنْ تُكْفَأَ
القُدُورُ وَأَنْ يُرَمَّلَ اللَّحْمُ بِالتُّرَابِ, meaning [He
ordered that the cooking-pots should be turned
upside-down, and] that the flesh should be stirred
about and mixed with dust, in order that no use
might be made of it. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And He defiled,
or smeared, him, or it, with blood; (S, M, TA;)
namely, a man, (S,) or a garment, and the like;
(M, TA;) and (TA) so ↓ رَمَلَهُ; (K TA;) but
in this sense also the former verb is the more
chaste. (TA.) And رُمِّلَ فُلَانٌ بِالدَّمِ Such a one
was defiled, or smeared, with blood. (T, TA.
[See also 4 and 5.]) ―
-b3-  In relation to speech, or
language, (TA,) التَّرْمِيلُ signifies (tropical:)  i. q. التَّزْيِيفُ;

the sand.] ―
-b3-  And [hence,] (assumed tropical:)  He became poor:
(Mgh:) or (assumed tropical:)  his provisions, or travelling-provisions, became difficult to obtain, and he became
poor: (Msb:) or his travelling-provisions went:
(Mgh:) and أَرْمَلُوا (tropical:)  their provisions, or travel-ling-provisions, became exhausted, or consumed:
(A 'Obeyd, T, S, M, K, TA:) from الرَّمْلُ; (Mgh,
TA;) as though [he or] they clave to the sand;
(TA;) like أَدْقَعَ, (Mgh,) or أَدْقَعُوا, (TA,) from
الدَّقْعَآءُ: (Mgh, TA:) or from رَمَلٌ meaning “ little

“ he made the weaving of the mat thin: ” (Har
p. 55:) and ارملوا زَادَهُمْ (tropical:)  They exhausted, or
consumed, their provisions, or travelling-provisions. (K, * TA. [In the TT, as from the M,
اتخذوه is erroneously put for أَنْفَدُوهُ, the explanation in the TA.]) ―

(Yz, T, S, Msb,) or, accord. to Sh, ارملت مِنْ
زَوْجِهَا, or من زوجها ↓ رَمِلَتٌ; (T, accord. to different copies;) and ↓ رَمَّلَتْ [alone], (K, TA,
[said in the latter to be on the authority of Sh,
and therefore it may perhaps be taken from a
copy of the T,]) inf. n. تَرْمِيلٌ; (TA;) (tropical:)  She (a
woman) became such as is termed أَرْمَلَةٌ, (T, Msb,
K, TA,) i. e. without a husband; (T, Msb;)
because of her being in need of one to expend
upon her; [for] Az says that she is not thus
called unless she be also poor: (Msb:) or [she
became a widow;] she lost her husband by his
death. (S.) ―
-b5-  And ارمل said of an arrow, It
became defiled, or smeared, with blood, (Ibn-
'Abbád, K, TA,) and had the mark thereof remaining upon it; (Ibn-'Abbád, TA;) and so
↓ ارتمل. (TA. [See also 2 and 5.])
-A2-  Said of a
poet, it is from الرَّمَلُ, like أَرْجَزَ from الرَّجَزُ; (TA;)
i. e. He versified, or composed verses, in the metre
termed الرَّمَلُ. (Ibn-Buzurj, L in art. قصد.)
-A3-
As a trans. v.: see 1, in five places. ―
-b2-  Also He
lengthened, or made long, a rope, or cord: (K:)

husband having died. (O, TA. [But in both I
find فى بيتها, an obvious mistranscription, for
which I read فى بَنِيهَا; and in the explanation, in
both, اقامت عليهم, for which I read قَامَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ.])
رَمْلٌ [Sand;] a kind of dust or earth, (M,)
well known: (Lth, T, M, Msb, K:) ↓ رَمْلَةٌ is its
n. un.; (M, K;) a more special term than the
former; (S;) signifying a piece, or portion, [or
tract, or collection,] thereof: (Lth, T, TA:) [and
the former word is also sometimes used as meaning
a tract, or collection, of sand:] the pl. [of mult.]
is رَمَالٌ (Lth, T, S, M, Msb, K) and [of pauc.]
أَرْمُلٌ; (M, K;) [and أَرَمِلُ is used as a pl. pl.,

well-known science. (TA in the present art. [See
a description of it voce خَطَّ.])
رَمَلٌ Weak rain: (IAar, T:) or little rain:
(Har p. 55:) or a small quantity of rain: (ElUmawee, T, S, M, K:) one says, أَصَابَهُمْ رَمَلٌ مِنْ
مَطَرٍ A small quantity of rain fell upon them:
(El-Umawee, T, M:) but Sh says, “I have not
heard رَمَلٌ in this sense except on the authority
of El-Umawee: ” (TA:) the pl. is أَرْمَالٌ. (T, S,
M.) ―

فَاعِلَاتُنْ (T, TA) six times; (TA;) so called from
الرَّمَلُ signifying “ a certain kind of walk or pace,”
inf. n. of رَمَلَ [q. v.]: (M, K: *) and Kh says
that it is also applied to any meagre verse or
poetry, incongruous in structure; such being so
named by the Arabs without their defining anything respecting it; as, for instance, the saying [of
'Abeed Ibn-El-Abras (TA in arts. ذنب and
قطب)],
فَالقُطَبِيَّاتُ فَالذَّنُوبُ  أَقْفَرَ مِنْ أَهْلِهِ مَلْحوبُ
[Melhoob (the name of a place, K in art. لحب)
has become destitute of its inhabitants, and El-
Kutabeeyát, (by which is meant a certain water,
called القُطَبِيَّةُ, with its environs, K* and TA in
art. قطب,) and Edh-Dhanoob (the name of a
place, TA in art. ذنب)]: he says also that, generally, the مَجْزُوْء [i. e. what is curtailed of two of
the original feet, or what consists of two feet
only,] is thus called by them: accord. to IJ, it is
applied by them to verse, or poetry, that is incongruous, unsound, or faulty, in structure, and
such as falls short of the original [standard so
as not to answer completely to any regular kind
or species]: (M, TA:) thus it signifies as first
explained above, and also any verse, or poetry,
that is not such as is termed قَصِيد [as meaning
that of which the hemistichs are complete] nor
such as is termed رَجَز [which some hold to be not
verse, or poetry, but a kind of rhyming prose].
(IJ, M, K. *) [See also زَمَلٌ.]
رَمْلَةٌ: see رَمْلٌ, of which it is the n. un.
رُمْلَةٌ sing. of رُمَلٌ, which signifies The diversity
of colours (وَشْىٌ) upon the legs of the wild bull:
(T: [see also رَمَلٌ:]) or رُمْلَةٌ signifies a black line
or streak, (IKh, M, IB, K,) as some say, (M,)
such as is upon the back and thighs of the gazelle:
(IKh, IB:) pl. [of mult.] رُمَلٌ and [of pauc.]
أَرْمَالٌ. (K.)
رَمَلَةٌ: see رَمَلٌ.
[
رَمْلِىٌّ Of, or relating to, رَمْل (or sand):

is said in a trad., of the Prophet, that he was lying
upon his side on the رمال of a mat, which had
made an impression upon his side: (T, TA: *) or,
as some relate it, of a couch; meaning, in this
case, that its face was woven of palm-leaves, and
that it had nothing spread upon it to lie upon, but
the mat only. (TA. [See رَمَلَ السَّرِيرَ.])
رَمِيلَةٌ Land (أَرْض) rained upon with الرَّمَل, i. e.
little rain. (Ibn-'Abbád, TA.)

أَرْمَلُ i. q. ↓ مُرْمِلٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  A man whose
provisions, or travelling-provisions, have become
difficult to obtain, [or exhausted, or consumed,
(see 4,)] and who has become poor: [as though
he were cleaving to the sand: (see again 4:)] pl.
أَرَامِلُ: (Msb:) or أَرْمَلُ is applied to a man, and
↓ أَرْمَلَةٌ to a woman, (M, K,) and the latter also
to a pl. number, (M,) as meaning needy, needing,
or in want: (M, K:) or as meaning [مِسْكِينٌ and]
مِسْكِينَةٌ [and مَسَاكِينُ, i. e. destitute, or indigent,
&c.]: (K:) and the pl. is أَرَامِلُ and أَرَامِلَةٌ; (M,
K;) after the manner of substs., because the
quality of a subst. is predominant therein: (M:)
↓ أَرْمَلَةٌ is applied to any collective number of men
and women, or men without women, or women
without men, after they have become in need or
want: (M:) [and] it is applied [also] to a man
and to a woman as meaning poor so as to be
unable to obtain anything: (T, and Mgh as from
the T:) accord. to ISk, أَرَامِلُ is applied to a number of men and women, as meaning مَسَاكِينُ
[expl. above]; (T, S, Mgh;) or so to a number of
persons whether men or women; (Msb;) and to
men though there be not among them women;

last, to a number of men and women needy,
needing, or in want; (S;) and to men needy,
needing, or in want, and weak, (S, K,) though

مَا يُحْمِّلُونَهُ إِلَّا مَا اسْتَفْقَرُوا لَهُ ↓ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَأَرْمَلَةُ, meaning [Verily the household of such a one is large,
and verily they are destitute of what camels they
may load therewith except] what they borrow
[for that purpose]; (T, * TA;) i. e., they are
a party not possessing camels, and unable to make
a journey except upon camels that they borrow;
[استفقروا being] from أُفْقِرَ ظَهْرَ بَعِيرِى signifying
“ he was lent the back of my camel. ” (TA.)
See also أُرْمُولَةٌ. ―
-b2-  ↓ أَرْمَلَةٌ is also applied to a
woman as meaning Having no husband: (T, S,
M, Msb, K:) or a widow; one whose husband
has died: (IAmb, Mgh:) or not if she possesses
competence, or wealth: (Ibn-Buzurj, T, Mgh,
Msb, K:) it is applied to her who has no husband
because she is in need of him who would expend
upon her; (Msb;) or to her whose husband has
died because her provision has gone and she has
lost him who earned for her (IAmb, Mgh) and
by means of whom her state of life had been
good: (IAmb:) in like manner, also, أَرْمَلُ is
applied to a man as meaning having no wife,
(T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) accord. to Kt (T, Mgh)
and Sh; (Mgh;) like as أَيِّمٌ is applied to a man
[as well as to a woman], and أَيِّمَةٌ to a woman:
(T:) or a widower; one whose wife has died:
(TA:) or أَرْمَلُ is not applied in this sense except
in cases of deviation from the usual course of
speech, (IAmb, Mgh, Msb, [and the like is said
in the Mgh also as on the authority of Lth, and in
the M as on the authority of IJ,]) because the
man's provision does not go in consequence of the
death of his wife, since she is not his maintainer,
(IAmb, Mgh, Msb,) whereas he is her maintainer: (IAmb:) Jereer says,
كُلُّ الأَرَامِلِ قَدْ قَضَيْتَ حَاجَتَهَا
فَمَنْ لِحَاجَةِ هٰذَا الأَرَمَلِ الذَّكَرِ
(M, TA,) or هٰذِى الأَرَامِلُ الخ; (S, Mgh; [in the
former ascribed in one of my copies to an unnamed poet, and in the other, to El-Hotei-ah;
but in the Mgh, to Jereer, as in the M;]) [i. e.
All the widows, or these widows, thou hast accomplished their want; but who is there for the want
of this male widowed person]; meaning thereby
himself. (M, TA.) It is said that, if one bequeath his property to the أَرَامِل, some of it is to
the men whose wives have died: (Mgh:) IB
says, on the authority of IKt, that when a man
says, “This property is for the أَرَامِل,” it is for
the men and the women, because الأَرَامِلُ applies
to the males and the women; but he adds, IAmb
says that it is to be given to the women exclusively
of the men, because الارامل generally applied to
the women. (TA. [This is cited in the TA as
though relating to ارامل as meaning مَسَاكِين:
but IAmb evidently uses it here as applying to
women whose husbands have died; and this is its
predominant meaning.]) ―
-b3-  It is also applied to
a [lizard of the kind called] ضَبّ, in the following
saying of a rájiz,
أُحبُّ أَنْ أَصْطَادَ ضَبًّا سَحْبَلَا
رَعَى الرَّبِيعَ وَالشِّتَآءَ أَرْمَلَا
(T, TA,) meaning [I love to hunt out, or catch,
a large ضبّ, that has pastured during the autumn
and the winter,] having no female, so that he may
be fat. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And one says also عَامٌ أَرْمَلُ
(ISk, T, S, M, K) and سَنَةٌ رَمْلَآءُ (ISk, T, S, M)
meaning (tropical:)  A year of little rain (ISk, T, S, M, K,
TA) and of little good or benefit. (T, M, K, TA.)
-A2-  Also i. q. أَبْلَقُ [i. e. Black and white: or white
in the kind legs as high as the thighs]: (AA, T:)
or a sheep or goat of which all the legs are black:
fem. رَمْلَآءُ: (A 'Obeyd, S:) or the latter is applied
to a ewe as meaning of which the legs are black,
the rest of her being white. (AZ, T, M, K.)
أَرْمَلَةٌ as fem. of أَرْمَلُ, and as an epithet applied
to a pl. number of persons: see the next preceding
paragraph in five places.
أُرْمُولَةٌ, as an epithet applied to a boy, or young
man, (غُلَامٌ, Lth, T, Ibn-'Abbád, K,) i. q. ↓ أَرْمَلُ
[as meaning Poor, needy, or the like]; (Ibn-
'Abbád, K;) accord. to Lth, (T, TA,) i. q. زَارَهْ
[i. e. abject] in Persian: (T, M, TA: [but in
two copies of the T زَاذَهْ; and in the TT, as from
the M, زَازَهْ:]) but Az says, I know not الأُرْمُولَةُ,
nor the Persian rendering thereof. (T.)
-A2-  Also
The stump (جُذْمُور) of the [plant, or tree, called]
عَرْفَج: pl. أَرَامِلُ and أَرَامِيلُ: (K:) or أَرَامِلُ

this sometimes means stumps, as well as roots,
&c.,]) of the عرفج. (M.)

(الرَّمْل) has been thrown. (TT, as from the T.)
And خَبِيصٌ مُرَمَّلٌ [A mess of dates and clarified
butter mixed together] into which dust, or earth,
and sand, have been put: (so in a copy of the T:

omission of what here follows:]) [or] such as has
been much stirred about and turned over (K, TA,
