رع1
رَعٌّ The being still, syn. سُكُونٌ, [a signification contr. to one borne by two other words
in this art.,] (IAar, K,) is the inf. n. of رَعَّتِ
الرِّيحُ, aor.
رَعُ3َ, [probably a mistake for
رَعِ3َ, which
is the regular form of an intrans. verb of this
class, notwithstanding the guttural letter,] The
wind was, or became, still. (TK.)
R. Q. 1
رَعْرَعَهُ He (God) caused him [a child,
or boy, as is implied in the S,] to grow. (S, Z,
K.) ―
-b2-  رَعْرَعَ دَابَّتَهُ He (a horseman) rode his
beast to train it when it was in the first stage of
training and as yet refractory. (O, TS, K.) In
IN the L we find إِذَا لَمْ تَكُنْ رَيِّضًا, [meaning when
it was not trained, رَيِّضًا being here used in the
sense of مَرُوضَةً,] in the place of إِذَا كَانَتْ رَيِّضًا,
which is the reading in the O and TS and K.
