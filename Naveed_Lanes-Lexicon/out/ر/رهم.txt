ارهمت السَّمَآءُ, (JK, K,) or السَّحَابَةُ, (S,)
The sky, or the cloud, shed the sort of rain, or
rains, termed رِهْمة, or رِهَام. (JK, S, K.)
رِهْمَةٌ A drizzling and lasting rain; i. e. a
lasting, or continuous, rain, consisting of small
drops: (JK:) or weak and lasting rain, (S, K,)
said by AZ to be such as falls with more force,
and passes away more quickly, than that which is
termed دِيمَةٌ: (S:) pl. رِهَمٌ and رِهَامٌ: (JK, S, K:)
El-Ámidee seems to have held that رِهَامٌ is pl. of
رَهَمَةٌ; for he likens these two words to إِكَامٌ and
أَكَمَةٌ; but this is at variance with what is held
by the leading lexicologists. (TA.) [See an ex.
of the pl. رِهَامٌ in a verse of Lebeed cited in the
first paragraph of art. رزق.]
أَرْضٌ رَهْمَآءُ Land upon which rains such as are
termed رِهَام have fallen: (Ham p. 99:) and
↓ رَوْضَةٌ مَرْهُومَةٌ, [from رُهِمَت, Meadows] watered
by the rain termed رِهْمَةٌ: (JK, S, K:) one should
not say مُرْهَمَةٌ. (K.)
رَهْمَانُ: see رَهُومٌ.
رَهَمَانٌ, in the going of camels, A bearing, and
leaning, on one side, or sideways. (JK, * K. [In
the former, it is implied that the word is رَهْمَان,
which is at variance with an express statement in
the K.])
رَهَامٌ (assumed tropical:)  A sheep, or goat, [شَاةٌ,] lean, or ema
ciated; (JK, K; [in the former written رُهَام, but
said in the latter to be like سَحَابٌ;]) and so
↓ رَهُومٌ: (TA:) [i. e.] you say also شَاةٌ رَهُومٌ, (JK,
K, TA,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  a sheep, or goat, lean, or
emaciated: (TA:) from [رَهُومٌ, or perhaps رَهَامٌ,
or both, as meaning] clouds (سَحَابٌ) that have
discharged their water. (JK.)
رُهَامٌ, applied to a bird, That does not prey:
(K:) or the bird called غُرْنُوق. (JK.)
-A2-  Also A
large number. (JK, K.)
رَهُومٌ: see رَهَامٌ. ―
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A man weak in seek
ing, or searching, [to find what is best to be done;]
who follows mere opinion; as also ↓ رَهْمَانُ.
(JK, K.)
أَرْهَمُ More [and most] fruitful, or plentiful, or
abundant in herbage or in the goods or conveniences or comforts of life: [as though meaning
more, and most, watered by rain such as is termed
رِهْمَة:] so in the saying, نَزَلْنَا بِفُلَانٍ فَكُنَّا فِى أَرْهَمِ
جَانِبَيْهِ [We alighted at the dwelling of such a one,
and we were in the more fruitful, &c., of the two
sides of his place of abode; meaning, and we
were entertained by him in the best, or most
bountiful, manner]. (S.)
مَرْهَمٌ [A place upon which has fallen rain such
as is termed رِهْمَةٌ: pl. مَرَاهِمُ: see an ex. in what
follows. ―
-b2-  Also] A certain application for
wounds; (S;) a soft plaster or dressing, (K, TA,)
the softest of medicaments, (TA,) [i. e. an unguent,
or the like,] with which a wound is plastered,
dressed, overspread, or anointed: (K, TA:) [pl.
as above:] it is an arabicized word [from the
Pers. مَرْهَمْ]: (S:) or derived from الرِّهْمَةُ, [as
some say,] because of its softness. (K.) You say,
مَرَاهِمُ الغَوَادِى مَرَاهِمُ البَوَادِى [The places watered
by the drizzling and lasting rains of the early
morning-clouds are the soft plasters, or unguents,
of the deserts]. (A, TA.)
رَوْضَةٌ مَرْهُومَةٌ: see أَرْضٌ رَهْمَآءُ, above.
