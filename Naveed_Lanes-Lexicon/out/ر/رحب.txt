رحب1
رَحُبَ, (Msb, K,) said of a place, (Msb,) or
of a thing, (TA,) and رَحُبَتْ, said of a land,
(أَرْض, S,) or of a country, (بِلَاد, A, TA,) aor.
رَحُبَ,
inf. n. رُحْبٌ (S, A, * Msb, K) and رَحَابَةٌ; (S, K;)
and رَحِبَ, (Msb, K,) and رَحِبَتْ, (TA,) aor.
رَحَبَ,
(Msb, K,) inf. n. رَحَبٌ; (Msb, TA;) and ↓ ارحب,
(Msb, K,) and ارحبت; (TA;) It was, or became,
ample, spacious, wide, or roomy. (S, K, TA.)
رَحُبَتِ الدَّارُ and ↓ أَرْحَبَت both signify the same,
i.e. The house, or abode, was ample, &c.; or may
the house, or abode, be ample, &c. (S, TA.) And
they said, عَلَيْكَ وَطُلَّتْ ↓ أَرْحَبَتْ, meaning May
it (the country, البِلَادُ,) be spacious to thee, and
be moistened by gentle rain, or by dew: so accord.
to Aboo-Is-hák. (TA.) ضَاقَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الأَرْضُ
بِمَا رَحُبَتْ, in the Kur ix. 119, means The earth
became strait to them with [i. e. notwithstanding]
its spaciousness. (Bd, Jel.) ―
-b2-  رَحُبَ, accord. to
the original usage, is trans. by means of a particle; so that one says, رَحُبَ بِكَ المَكَانُ [The
place was, or may the place be, spacious with
thee]: afterwards, by reason of frequency of
usage, it became trans. by itself; and thus one
said, رَحُبَتْكَ الدَّارُ [The house, or abode, was, or
may the house, or abode, be, spacious with thee,
or to thee]. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  [Hence the saying,]
أَرَحُبَكُمُ الدُّخُولُ فِى طَاعَتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  Was it proper, or
allowable, for you [to enter among his obeyers?
i. e., to become obedient to him?]: (S, K * TA:)
referring to El-Kirmánee, (so in the S,) or Ibn-El-Kirmánee: (so in the TA:) mentioned by Kh,
on the authority of Nasr Ibn-Seiyár; but he says,
(S,) the verb thus used is anomalous; (S, K;)
for a verb of the measure فَعُلَ is not trans., (K,
TA,) accord. to the grammarians, (TA,) except
with the tribe of Hudheyl, who, accord. to AAF,
make it trans. (K, TA) when its meaning admits
of its being so: (TA:) Kh mentions the phrase
رَحُبَتْكُمُ الدَّارُ [meaning The house, or abode, was,
or may the house, or abode, be, spacious with, or
to, you]; but it is thought that there is an ellipsis
here, and that it is for رَحُبَتْ بِكُمُ الدَّارُ: and ElJelál Es-Suyootee mentions, on the authority of
AAF, the saying رَحُبَ اللّٰهُ جَوْفَهُ, as meaning
وَسَّعَهُ [i. e. May God make wide his belly]:
(TA:) [J says, app. quoting Kh,] there is no
sound verb of the measure فَعُلَ that is trans.
except this; but as to the unsound, there is a
difference of opinion: accord. to Ks, قُلْتُهُ is originally قَوُلْتُهُ; but Sb says that this is not allowable, because it is trans.: (S:) Az says that
رَحُبَتْكُمْ is not held to be allowable by the grammarians; and that Nasr is not an [approved]
evidence. (TA.)

رَحَّبَ see 4. ―
-b2-  رحّب بِهِ (S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n.
تَرْحِيبٌ (S, A, K) and تَرْحَابٌ (Har p. 579,) He
said to him مَرْحَبًا; (S, Msb;) [he welcomed him
with the greeting of مَرْحَبًا; or simply he welcomed
him;] he invited him to ampleness, spaciousness,
or roominess: (A, K:) and ↓ مَرْحَبَ, also, signifies he said مَرْحَبًا; but the expression commonly
known is رَحَّبَ بِهِ. (Har pp. 422-3.) You say,

Hajjáj said, when he slew Ibn-El-Kirreeyeh,
أَرْحِبْ يَا غُلَامُ جُرْحَهُ [Make wide, O young man,
his wound]. (S.) And one says, in chiding a
horse or mare, أَرْحِبْ (S, K) and أَرْحِبِى (S, A,
K,) meaning Make room, and withdraw. (S,

or the ways of commencing it, be easy, the ways
of return from it, or the ways of completing it,
are difficult]. (A, TA.)

رُحْبٌ an inf. n. of رَحُبَ [q.v.]. (S, Msb, K.)
[Used as a simple subst.,] Ampleness, spaciousness, wideness, or roominess. (S A, Mgh, K.)
You say, دَعَاهُ إِلَى الرُّحْبِ [He invited him to
ampleness, &c.]. (A.) And hence the saying of
Zeyd Ibn-Thábit to 'Omar, هٰهُنَا بِالرُّحْبِ, meaning Advance to ampleness, &c. (Mgh.) See also
مَرْحَبٌ, in two places. ―
-b2-  [It is also used as an
epithet:] see the next preceding paragraph.
رَحَبٌ: see the next following paragraph.
رَحَبَةٌ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and رَحْبَةٌ, (A, Mgh,
Msb,) K,) the former of which is the more chaste,

TA,) or a spacious vacant tract, (A,) or a spacious piece of ground, (Msb,) between, or among,

enclosure, or a [kind of wide bench of stone or
brick such as is called] دُكَّان, that is made at
the doors of some of the mosques in the towns
and the rural districts, for prayer: hence the
saying of Aboo-'Alee Ed-Dakkák, [in which it
means an enclosure outside the door of a mosque,]
“ It is not fit that the حَائِض should enter the
رحبْة of the mosque of a people, whether the رحبة
be contiguous or separate: ” and hence, also, in a
trad. of 'Alee, by the رحبة of El-Koofeh is meant
a دُكَّان in the midst of the mosque of El-Koofeh,
upon which he used to sit and to preach, and
upon which he is related to have cast the spoils
that he obtained from the people of En-Nahrawán:
(Mgh:) pl. ↓ رَحَبٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ رَحْبٌ (K)

-b2-
Also, both words, An ample tract of land, that
produces much herbage, and in which people
alight, or abide, much, or often: (AHn, K:)
pl. as above, accord. to the K; but accord. to
IAar, رَحْبَةٌ signifies an ample tract of land;
(TA;) and he says that its pl. is رُحَبٌ, like as
قُرًى is pl. of قَرْيَةٌ: Az says that this occurs as an
anomalous pl. of words of the defective class, and
that he had not heard a word of the perfect class
of the measure فَعْلَةٌ having a pl. of the measure
فُعَلٌ; but that IAar is an authority worthy of
reliance. (L, Msb.) And رَحَبَةُ الوَادِى, and رَحْبَتُهُ
The part of the valley in which its water flows
into it from its two sides: (K, TA:) pl. رِحَابٌ
(TA.) [Or the pl.] رِحَابٌ signifies Plain, smooth,
or soft, places, in which water collects and stagnates: they are the places where vegetation is
most rapid, and are at the extremity of a valley,
and in its middle, and sometimes in an elevated
place, where water collects and stagnates, surrounded by what is more elevated: if in a plain
tract of land, people alight and sojourn there: if
in the interior of water-courses, people do not
alight and sojourn there: if in the interior of a
valley, and retaining the water, not very deep,

and sojourn by the side thereof: رحاب are not in
sands; but they are in low and in elevated tracts
of land. (L.) ―

(K:) and the رُحْبَيَانِ, are the two ribs next to the
armpits, among the upper ribs: (K:) or the
place to which each elbow returns [when, after it
has been removed from its usual place, it is brought
back thereto; which place in a beast is next the
arm pit]: (S, K:) it is there only that the camel's
elbow wounds the callous protuberance upon his
breast: (S:) or the رحبى is the place where the
heart beats, (Az, K, TA,) in a beast and in
a man: (Az, TA:) or, as some say, the part
from the place where the neck is set on to the
place where end the cartilages of the ribs, or the
extremities of the ribs projecting over the belly:
or the part between the two ribs of the base of the
neck and the place to which the shoulder-blade
returns [when, after it has moved from its usual
position, it is brought back thereto, i. e. its lower
part, next the armpit]: and the رُحْبَيَانِ, also
called the ↓ رُحْبَايَاوَانِ [perhaps a mistranscription
for رُحْبَاوَانِ as though the sing. were رُحْبَآءٌ,] of
the horse, are the upper parts of the كَشْحَانِ [or
two flanks.] (TA.) ―

IAar say: and the Arabs also say, لَا مَرْحَبًا بِكَ,
meaning May it [the land or country] not be
ample, or spacious, to thee: مَرْحَبًا, he says, is one
of the inf. ns. that are used in calling down
blessings or curses on a man; as سَقْيًا and رَعْيًا
and جَدْعًا and عَقْرًا, for سَقَاكَ اللّٰهُ and رَعَاكَ اللّٰهُ
&c.: and Fr says that the meaning [of مَرْحَبًا or
مَرْحَبًا بِكَ] is اللّٰهُ بِكَ مَرْحَبًا ↓ رَحَّبَ [May God
