رقأ1
رَقَأَ الدَّمْعُ, aor.
رَقَاَ, inf. n. رَقْءٌ and رُقُوْءٌ, (S,
Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,) The tears stopped, or ceased
to flow; (Fs, JK, S, Mgh, Msb;) or dried up,
(IDrst, Aboo-'Alee El-Kálee, K,) and stopped,
or ceased: (K:) and in like manner, الدَّمُ the
blood: (JK, S, Mgh, Msb:) whence the phrase
جُرْحَانِ لَا يَرْقَآنِ Two wounds not ceasing to bleed.
(Mgh.) And in like manner also, (JK,) رَقَأَ العِرْقُ,
(Fs, JK, K, TA, [not العَرَقُ, as supposed by
Golius and Freytag,]) inf. ns. as above, (K,)
The vein stopped or ceased [bleeding]; syn. اِنْقَطَعَ,
(Fs, JK, TA,) and سَكَنَ, (TA,) or اِرْتَفَعَ; (K;)
[in all of which explanations, دَمُهُ is understood.]
-A2-  رَقَأَ بَيْنَهُمْ, (K, TA,) aor.
رَقَاَ, inf. n. رَقْءٌ, (TA,)
He effected a reconciliation, or made peace, between them; (K, TA;) like رَفَأَ: (TA:) and [in
like manner,] رَقَأَ مَا بَيْنَهُمْ He arranged, or rightly
disposed, or rectified, the matter, or affair, between
them. (TA.) And the former phrase (رقأبينهم)
also signifies He created disorder or discord, or
made mischief, between them: thus having two
contr. meanings. (K.)
-A3-  رَقَأَ فِى الدَّرَجَةِ, (K,)
and رَقِئَ, also, mentioned by Ibn-Málik in the
“ Káfiyeh,” as a dial. var. of رَقِىَ, and both mentioned by IKtt, aor. of each
رَقَاَ, (TA,) He ascended
the series of stairs, or the ladder: (K:) on the
authority of Kr; but extr. [with respect to usage].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] اِرْقَأْ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ (a dial. var.
of اِرْقَ TA) (assumed tropical:)  Be gentle with thyself, and impose
not upon thyself more than thou art able to perform: (JK, S, TA:) or abstain thou, for I
know thine evil qualities or actions: (JK:) or,
as some say, rectify thou, or rightly dispose, first
thy case, or thine affair. (TA.)

ارقأ دَمْعَهُ, (S,) or الدَّمْعَ, (K,) said of God,
(S, K,) He caused his, or the, tears to stop, or cease,
flowing; (S, TA;) or caused them to dry up,
and to stop, or cease. (K.) The saying لَا أَرْقَأَ اللّٰهُ
دَمْعَتَهُ is expl. by El-Mundhiree as meaning May
God not remove, or do away with, (لَا رَفَعَ,) his
tear. (TA.) You say also, أَرْقَأْتُ العِرْقَ [meaning
I caused the vein to stop or cease bleeding: see 1].
(K, TA.)
رَقُوْءٌ A styptic; or a thing that is put upon
blood for the purpose of stanching it, or stopping
its flowing: (S, K:) a subst. from رَقَأَ. (Msb.)
Hence the saying, (Msb,) accord. to J, in a trad.,
but this is a mistake, for it is a saying of Aktham,
(K,) or, accord. to the Expositions of the Fs, it
was said by Keys Ibn-'Ásim El-Minkaree, (TA,)
لَا تَسُبُّوا الإِبِلَ فَإِنَّ فِيهَا رَقُوْءَ الدَّمِ [Revile not ye
camels, or it may perhaps mean hock not ye
camels, but the former, I am told, is here meant,
for in them is a preventive of the flowing of
blood]; alluding to their being given in compensation for homicide, and thus preventing the shedding of blood. (S, Msb, K, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
رَجُلٌ رَقُوْءٌ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ (assumed tropical:)  A man who is a reconciler
of the people; or a peacemaker between them: and
[so] رَقُوْءٌ لِمَا بَيْنَهُمْ, a phrase used by a poet. (TA.)
مَرْقَأَةٌ and مِرْقَأَةٌ, (K,) the former a n. of place,
the latter an instrumental n., and both correct,
dial. vars. of مَرْقَاةٌ and مِرْقَاةٌ, (TA,) A series of
stairs; or a ladder. (K, TA.)
