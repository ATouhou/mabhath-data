(Lth, T, S,) as, for instance, a rope becoming old
and worn-out, or a house, (Lth, T,) or a building,
(Mgh,) or a wall, &c.; (Msb;) as also رَمَّ شَأْنَهُ,
(S,) or شَأْنَهَا referring to a house (دَار): (Lth, T:)
and in like manner, he rectified it, namely, an
affair, after it had become disorganized, or disordered: (Lth, T:) and ↓ رمّم signifies the same
in an intensive sense; [i. e. he repaired it, &c.,
much, or well:] (Msb:) and ↓ رَمْرَمَ he repaired,
or rectified, his affair, case, state, or condition.
(TA.) The saying, كُنَّا أَهْلَ ثَمِّهِ وَرَمِّهِ, (T, S,)
occurring in a trad., (S,) accord. to the relaters
thereof ↓ ثُمِّهِ وَرُمِّهِ, but A'Obeyd holds the former
reading to be the right, (T, S,) means, accord. to
AA, We were the fit persons to put it into a
good, sound, right, or proper, state: (T:) or,
accord. to A'Obeyd, to put it into such a state,
and to eat it. (T, S. [See another explanation
of the verb in what follows.]) ―
-b2-  You say also,
رَمَّ سَهْمَهُ, meaning (tropical:)  [He made his arrow even, or
straight, by means of his eye; or] he looked at his
arrow until he made it even, or straight. (TA.)

يَرُمُّ (T, S,) inf. n. رَمٌّ, (TA,) He ate it. (T, S,
K.) And it is said in a trad., عَلَيْكُمْ بِأَلْبَانِ البَقَرِ
فَإِنَّهَا تَرُمُّ مِنْ كُلِّ الشَّجَرِ [Keep ye to the milk of
cows, for they eat of all the tress]; (T, S, * TA;)
i. e. تَأْكُلُ: or, accord. to one reading, it is ↓ تَرْتَمُّ.
(TA.) رَمَّتِ الشَّاةُ الحَشِيشَ aor. تَرُمُّ, inf. n. رَمٌّ,
means The sheep, or goat, took the dry herbage,
or fodder, with its lips. (M.) And رَمَّتِ الشَّاةُ

العَظْمَ ↓ ترمّم He ate off the flesh from the bone;
syn. تَعَرَّقَهُ: or he left the bone like the رِمَّة
[q. v.]: in [some of] the copies of the K, تَرَمَّمَ is
erroneously explained by تَعَزَّقَ; [in my MS. copy,
by تَعَرَّفَ; and in the CK, by تَفَرَّقَ;] the right
reading being تَعَرَّقَ, as in the A. (TA.) And
it is said in a trad., respecting the she-cat, وَلَا
مِنْ خَشَاشِ الأَرْضِ ↓ أَرْسَلْتُهَا تُرَمْرِمُ, meaning [And
I did not send her] for her to eat [of the creeping

-A3-  رَمَّ العَظْمُ, aor. يَرِمُّ
(T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. رَمٌّ (T, M,) or
رِمَّةٌ, (S,) or both, (K, TA, [the former written in
the CK رِمّ]) and رَمِيمٌ; (M, K;) and ↓ ارمّ; (M,
K; [but see what follows;]) The bone became
such as is termed رمَّة; (M, TA;) [i. e.,] became
old and decayed; (MA, KL;) syn. بَلِىَ. (T, S,
Mgh, Msb, K.) Accord. to IAar, one says,
رَمَّتْ عِظَامُهُ, and ↓ أَرَمَّتْ, meaning His bones
became old and decayed; syn. بَلِيَتْ: but others
explain العَظْمُ ↓ ارمّ differently, as below: see 4.
(T.) In the saying, mentioned in a trad., يَا
↓ رَسُولَ اللّٰهِ كَيْفَ تُعْرْضُ صَلَاتُنَا عَلَيْكَ وَقَدْ أَرَمْتَ,
meaning بَلِيتَ [i. e. O Apostle of God, how shall
our blessing be offered, or addressed, to thee
when thou shalt have become decayed in the
grave?], the last word is originally أَرْمَمْتَ; one
of the two م s being rejected; like as is done in
أَحَسْتَ, for أَحْسَسْتَ: (IAth, K, * TA: [in the
CK, تَعْرَضُ is put in the place of تُعْرَضُ:]) accord.
to one relation, it is أَرَمَّتَ; accord. to another,
رَمَمْتَ; and accord. to another, أُرِمْتَ: but the
first is the proper manner of relation. (TA.)
And رَمَّ الحَبْلُ The rope became [old and worn
out or rotten, (see رُمَّةٌ,) or] ragged, or dissundered. (M.)
2
رَمَّ3َ see 1, first sentence.
4
ارمّ, said of a bone, It had in it, or contained, رِمّ, i. e. marrow, (T, S, K,) running therein. (S.) One says of a sheep or goat (S, M)
that is lean, or emaciated, (S,) and of a she-camel, (M,) مَا يُرِمُّ مِنْهَا مَضْرِبٌ, (S, M,) meaning
Not a bone of her that is broken and from which
the marrow is [sought to be] extracted [contains
any marrow]: (M:) i. e., if any of her bones be
broken, no marrow will be found in it. (S.)
And ارمّت is said of a she-camel in the first stage
of fatness when becoming in good condition of
body, and in the last stage thereof when becoming
lean; (M, TA;) meaning She had in her somewhat of marrow. (TA.) ―

reason of such a thing; like أَرَنَّ لَهُ. (T in art.
رن.)

step by step, or time after time, with the repairing
of it; or with the putting it into a good, sound,

in four places. ―
-b2-  ارتمّ is also said of a young
camel as meaning He began to be in that state in
which one could feel his hump. (K.)
10
استرمّ It (a wall, S, MA, Mgh, K, or a
building, KL) needed, or required, its being
repaired; (M, MA, K, KL; expl. in the M and
K by دَعَا إِلَى إِصْلَاحِهِ;) having become old:
(MA:) or attained to the time in which it should
be repaired; (S, Mgh;) a long period having
elapsed since it was plastered with mud. (S.)
R. Q. 1
رَمْرَمَ: see 1, in two places.
R. Q. 2
تَرَمْرَمَ He moved his lips, (T,) or his
mouth, (S,) to speak: (T, S:) or تَرَمْرَمُوا they put
themselves in motion to speak, but spake not:
(M, K:) but it is said to be mostly used in
negative phrases. (TA.) One says, مَا تَرَمْرَمَ فُلَانٌ
بِحَرْفٍ Such a one uttered not [a letter, or a
word]: (T, TA:) or put not himself in motion
[therewith]. (IDrd, TA.) And كَلَّمَهُ فَمَا تَرَمْرَمَ
[He spoke to him and] he returned not a reply.
(M, TA.)
رَمٌّ an inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (Lth, T, S, &c.) ―
-b2-
One says, مَالِى مِنْهُ حَمٌّ وَلَا رَمٌّ There is not for
me any avoiding it, or escaping it: (S:) or
مَا لَهُ عَنْ ذٰلِكَ الأَمْرِ حَمٌّ وَلَا رَمٌّ (T, TA) There is
not for him any avoiding, or escaping, that
thing, or affair: (TA:) and some say ↓ حُمٌّ وَلَا رُمٌّ:
(S:) so says Lth: (T:) [accord. to ISd,] in the
saying ↓ مَا عَنْ ذٰلِكَ حُمٌّ وَلَا رُمٌّ, meaning There is
no avoiding, or escaping, that, رُمٌّ is an imitative
sequent; (M;) and so says Lth. (T. [But see
the next paragraph.]) ―
-b3-  See also another signification assigned to رَمٌّ in the last sentence but
one of the next paragraph. ―
-b4-  [And see the last
sentence also of that paragraph.]
رُمٌّ: see 1, second sentence: ―
-b2-  and see also the
paragraph next preceding this, in two places. ―
-b3-
Also i. q. بَيْتٍ ↓ مَرَمَّةُ, (ISk, T, S, M,) i. e.
Household-goods; or the utensils and furniture
of a house or tent. (M. [This explanation, from
the M, I have found, in the TT, since I composed
art. ثم; in which I have said that, accord. to
analogy, مَرَمَّةُ البَيْتِ app. signifies the means by
which a house, or tent, is put into a good state;
and therefore good furniture and utensils.]) So
in the saying, مَا لَهُ ثُمٌّ وَلَا رُمٌّ, (ISk, T, S, M,) and
مَا يَمْلِكُ ثُمًّا وَلَا رُمًّا, (ISk, T, S,) i. e. He has not,
and he possesses not, such household-goods as
water-skins, or milk-skins, and vessels, (ISk, T,
M,) nor any of the utensils and furniture of the
house or tent. (ISk, * T, * M.) This explanation
is better than the saying of Lth [that رُمٌّ is an
imitative sequent: see the next preceding paragraph]. (T.) One says also, مَا لَهُ حُمٌّ وَلَا رُمٌّ,
meaning He has not anything: (S:) or he has
neither little nor much. (TA voce حَمٌّ [q. v.])
[See also ثُمٌّ.] ―
-b4-  Also i. q. هَمٌّ [as meaning An
object, or a thing intended or meant or determined
upon or desired, in the mind: and perhaps also
anxiety; or disquietude, or trouble, of mind].
(M, K. [This signification, هَمٌّ, Freytag has
assigned to رَمٌّ, not to رُمٌّ; rendering it “ cura,
sollicitudo; ” as from the K; in which the word
bearing it is expressly said to be “ with damm. ”])
So in the saying, مَا لَهُ رُمٌّ غَيْرُ كَذَا [He has not
any object in his mind except such a thing]. (M.)
And so in the saying, مَا لَهُ حُمٌّ وَلَا رُمٌّ غَيْرُكَ and
↓ حَمٌّ وَلَا رَمٌّ [He has not any object in his mind
except thee]. (TA in art. حم.)
-A2-  Also A company of men: occurring in a trad. applied to a
company of [the people called] أَكْرَاد, abiding [in
a place] like a حَى [or tribe] of the Arabs of the
desert: [perhaps correctly رَمٌّ, from the Pers. رَمْ:]
said by Aboo-Moosà to be app. a Pers. word.
(TA.)
رِمٌّ The herbage and other things that are upon
the land: whence the current saying, جَآءَ فُلَانٌ
بِالطِّمِّ وَالرِّمِّ, meaning Such a one brought everything of what is on the land and in the sea: [or,
of what is in the sea and on the land; for] الطِّمُّ
means “ the sea; ” and is originally الطّمُّ, but is
pronounced [in this case] الطِّمّ to assimilate it to
الرِّمّ. (T.) [Or] i. q. ثَرًى [app. as meaning
Good of any kind; and particularly wealth;
as appears from what immediately follows]: one
says, جَآءَهُ بِالطِّمِّ وَالرِّمّ, meaning He brought him
much wealth. (S.) [Or] جَآءَ بِالطِّمِّ وَالرِّمِّ means
He brought what was of the sea and what was of
the land: (بِالبَحْرِىِّ وَالبَرِّىّ, K: [so in MS. copies
and in the CK: in the copy of the K followed in
the TA, and in like manner in the M, بالبحر
والثرى, which, I think, is evidently a false
reading:]) or moist and dry: or earth and water:
(M, K:) or much wealth; (K;) as in the S:
(TA:) and it is said in the copies of the K, [and
in the M,] that الرِّمُّ signifies what is borne [on
its surface] by the water; but this is a signification of الطِّمُّ; and الرِّمُّ signifies what is borne by
the wind: (TA:) or what is upon the ground, of
fragments of dry herbage. (M, K.) [See also
art. طم.] ―
-b2-  Also Marrow. (T, S, M, K.)
رُمَّةٌ The remains of a rope after it has become
ragged, or dissundered: (T:) or a piece of a rope
(S, M, Msb, K) that is old and worn out or
rotten; (S;) as also ↓ رِمَّةٌ: (M, K:) pl. [of mult.]
رُمَمٌ (T, S,) or رِمَمٌ (M, K,) and رِمَامٌ (S, M,
K) and [of pauc.] أَرْمَامٌ: (M, K:) and they said
also حَبْلٌ أَرْمَامٌ and رِمَمٌ [or رُمَمٌ] and رِمَامٌ; (M,
K;) [like حَبْلٌ أَرْمَاثٌ and ثَوْبٌ أَخْلَاقٌ &c.;] thus
using the pl. as though every part [of the rope]
were termed a single thing. (M.) ―
-b2-  Hence the
saying, أَعْطَيْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ بِرُمَّتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  I gave him the thing
altogether: (T:) or دَفَعَ إِلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ بِرُمَّتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He
gave him the thing altogether: (S:) or أَخَذَهُ بِرُمَّتِهِ
(assumed tropical:)  He took it altogether: (M; and the like is said
in the Msb:) and أَتَيْتُكَ بِالشَّىْءِ بِرُمّتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  I brought
thee, or have brought thee, the thing altogether:
(M:) or أَعْطَاهُ بِرُمَّتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He gave it altogether:
(K:) originally meaning the rope that is put
upon the neck of the camel: (T:) [i. e.] originating from the fact that a man gave to another a
camel with a rope upon his neck: (S, K:) or
from the fact that a man sold a camel with a
rope upon his neck; and it was said, Give him
with his رُمَّة: (Msb:) or, as some say, from the
bringing a captive bound with his رُمَّة; but this
is not a valid assertion. (M.) In all the copies
of the K, الرُّمَّةُ is also expl. as syn. with الجَبْهَةُ;
but [SM says,] I have not found it in the originals from which it is derived; and may-be the
right reading is الجُمْلَةُ. (TA.) 'Alee said, dispraising the present world, أَسْبَابُهَا رِمَامٌ, meaning
(assumed tropical:)  [Its ties (lit. ropes) are] old and worn out or
rotten. (TA.) ―
-b3-  ↓ أَرْمَامٌ [perhaps as pl. of رُمَّةٌ]
also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The last remains of herbage. (M,
TA.)
رِمَّةٌ Old and decayed bones: (AA, T, S, M,
Msb, K:) or the old and decayed, of bones:
(Mgh:) pl. رِمَمٌ and رِمَامٌ. (S, Msb.) The performance of the act termed الاِسْتِنْجَآء therewith is
forbidden. (Mgh, TA.) [See also رَمِيمٌ.] ―
-b2-  [And
A bone in which is marrow. (Freytag, from the
“ Kitáb el-Addád. ”)] ―
-b3-  See also رُمَّةٌ, first sentence.
-A2-  Also A two-winged ant: (M, K:) so
accord. to Aboo-Hátim; but disallowed by ElBekree. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And The أَرَضَة [or woodfretter], (M, K,) in some one or more of the
dialects. (M, TA.)
رُمُمٌ Clever, ingenious, skilful, or intelligent,
girls, or young women: (IAar, K:) app. pl. of
↓ رَامَّةٌ, [as it is said to be in the TK, whence
Freytag (who has mentioned it as from the K,
explaining it as an epithet applied to a girl meaning “ ingeniosa, prudens,”) appears to have taken
it,] which signifies a female skilful in repairing.
(TA.)
رُمَامٌ: see رَمِيمٌ. ―
-b2-  It is applied as an epithet to
ثُمَام, in a saying of 'Omar, explained in art. ثم:
accord. to some, it means that whereof the heads
are grown, so that they are eaten (تُرَمُّ, i. e.
تُؤْكَلُ): it is also applied to a herb, or leguminous
plant, such that the cattle pluck it with their
mouths, obtaining but little thereof: and to herbage that had dried up when becoming green. (T.)
شِاْةٌ رَمُومٌ A sheep, or goat, that eats that by
which it passes. (M, TA.)
رَمِيمٌ A bone old and decayed: (S, M, Msb, K:)
and ↓ رُمَامٌ signifies the same (K, TA) in an intensive sense: (TA:) or the former is like رِمَّةٌ;
(A 'Obeyd, T, and Ksh in xxxvi. 78;) i. e. it is
a subst., signifying the old and decayed, of bones;
(Ksh and Bd ibid.;) not of the measure فَعِيلٌ in
the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ or مَفْعُولٌ: (Ksh
ibid.:) or it is used in the sense of the measure
مَفْعُولٌ, [meaning eroded,] from رَمَمْتُهُ [“ I ate
it ”]: (Bd ibid.:) its pl. is in most instances أَرِمَّآءُ
[when it is used as a subst. or as an epithet], like
أَدِلَّآءُ pl. of دَلِيلٌ [or أَقْرِبَآء pl. of قَرِيبٌ]; and رِمَامٌ
also occurs [when it is used as a subst., for رِمَّةٌ,
of which رِمَامٌ is a pl., or when it is used as an
epithet], like كِرَامٌ pl. of كَرِيمٌ: (Msb:) or you
say أَعْظُمٌ رَمَائِمُ, and رَمِيمٌ also; or رَمِيمٌ may have
the meaning of a gen. n., and therefore be used
in the place of a pl. (M.) It is said in the Kur
ubi suprà, مَنْ يُحْيِى الْعِظَامَ وَهِىَ رَمِيمٌ [Who will
quicken the bones when they are old and decayed
&c.?]; the last word being without ة because it is
a subst., as expl. above, (Ksh, Bd, Jel,) not an
epithet; (Ksh, Jel;) or because it is used in the
sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, as stated above;
(Bd;) or because words of the measures فَعِيلٌ
and فَعُولٌ are sometimes used alike as masc. and
fem. [and sing.] and pl., like صَدِيقٌ and رَسُولٌ
and عَدُوٌّ. (S.) And Hátim, or some other, says,
أَمَا وَالَّذِى لَا يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ غَيْرُهُ
وَيُحْيِى العِظَامَ البِيضَ وَهْىَ رَمِيمُ
[Verily, or now surely, by Him beside whom none
knoweth the secret, and who quickeneth the white
bones when they are old and decayed &c.]; in
which رميم may have the meaning of a gen. n.,
as observed above. (M.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  Anything old and decayed or worn out. (M.) One
says, أَحْيَى رَمِيمَ المَكَارِمِ (tropical:)  [He revived what had
become decayed of generous qualities or actions or
practices]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  The remains of the
herbage of the next preceding year: (Lh, M:)
from the same word in the sense first expl. above.
(M.)
-A2-  رَمِيمُ is one of the names of The east, or
easterly, wind; الصَّبَا: and is also a proper name
for a woman. (M.)

any colour upon her. (M.)
رَمَّامٌ قَشَّاشٌ One who collects what has fallen
of food, and the worst thereof, to eat it, not preserving himself from its uncleanness. (T, as heard
by its author from the Arabs.)
رُمَّانٌ is of the measure فُعْلَانٌ accord. to Sb:
accord. to Abu-l-Hasan [i. e. Akh], of the measure
فُعَّالٌ, (M, TA,) and is [therefore] mentioned in
the S and K in art. رمن [q. v.]: (TA:) the n. un.
is with ة. (M.)
رَمْرَامٌ The حَشِيش [or herbs, or dry herbage,] of
the [season called] رَبِيع: and also a certain species
of trees, (S, M,) of sweet scent: n. un. with ة:
(M:) or رَمْرَامَةٌ signifies a certain well-known
sort of حَشِيش in the desert; and رَمْرَامٌ, much
thereof: (T:) or this latter signifies a certain
herb having prickly branches and leaves, that forbid the touch, rising to the height of a cubit; long
in the leaves, broad, and intensely green, having
a yellow flower, and eagerly desired by the cattle:
(AHn, M:) or a certain dust-coloured plant,
(Aboo-Ziyád, M, K,) which people use as a remedy
for the sting of the scorpion. (Aboo-Ziyád, M.)
رِامَّةٌ: see رُمُمٌ, of which it is thought to be the
singular.
أَرْمَامٌ a pl. of رُمَّةٌ as signifying “ a piece of a
rope: ” (M, K:) ―
-b2-  and perhaps also in another
sense: see the latter word, last sentence.
مُرِمٌّ Containing رِمّ, i. e. marrow; applied to a
bone. (T.) And, [in like manner without ة,]
applied to a she-camel, (S, M, K,) in the first
stage of fatness when becoming in good condition
of body, and in the last stage thereof when becoming lean, (M,) meaning Having in her somewhat of marrow. (S, M, * K. *)
-A2-  Also Silent;
(A 'Obeyd, T, S;) in a general sense; or, as some
say, from fear, or fright; (TA;) applied to a
man, (A 'Obeyd, T,) and to a bird, as in the saying of a rájiz, (S,) namely, Homeyd El-Arkat,
(TA,).
مُرْخًى رِوَاقَاهُ هُجُودٌ سَامِرُهْ  يَرِدْنَ وَاللَّيْلُ مُرمٌّ طَائِرُهُ
[They come to the water when the bird of night
is silent, when its curtains (lit. its two curtains)
of darkness are let down, when the holders of
discourse therein are sleeping]. (S, * TA.)
-A3-
[The pl.] مُرِمَّاتٌ signifies Calamities, or misfortunes: (T, K:) so accord. to AZ in the saying, رَمَاهُ بِالمُرِمَّاتِ [He smote him, or afflicted
him, with calamiites, or misfortunes]: or, accord.
to Aboo-Málik, it signifies المُسْكِتَات [i. e. silencing
words or acts]. (T.)
مَرَمَّةٌ [originally مَرْمَمَةٌ, a noun of the same class
as مَجْنبَنَةٌ and مَبْخَلَةٌ &c., meaning A cause of
repair: and hence, a thing needing repair; as
in a phrase mentioned voce رَقِيعٌ]. ―
-b2-  See also
مَرَمَّةُ بَيْتِ, voce رُمٌّ. ―
-b3-  And see what here follows.
مِرَمَّةٌ, (Th, T, S, M, TA,) accord. to the K,
مَرِمَّةٌ, but this is a mistake, (TA,) The lip of any
cloven-hoofed animal, (Th, T, S, M, K, TA,) such

مَرْمُومٌ sing. of مَرَامِيمٌ, (TA,) which is [an
epithet] applied to arrows, meaning Having the
