رسم1
رَسَمَ الدَّارَ, (M,) or الدِّيَارَ, (K,) [aor.
رَسُمَ, accord.
to a rule of the K,] inf. n. رَسْمٌ, (M,) It (the rain)
rased the house or dwelling, or the houses or
dwellings, leaving a relic, or relics, thereof cleaving to the ground. (M, K.) In the saying of
El-Hotei-ah,
أَمِنْ رَسْمِ دَارٍ مُرْبِعٌ وَمُصِيفُ
لِعَيْنَيْكَ مِنْ مَآءِ الشُّؤُونِ وَكِيفُ
[Is it in consequence of autumn-rain's and springrain's rasing of a dwelling so as to leave only a
relic thereof cleaving to the ground, that there is
to thine eyes a distilling of the water of the tearchannels?], مربع and مصيف are in the nom. case
because of the inf. n., i.e. رسم. (M, TA. [But in
the latter, مَصِيفُ: and in a copy of the former,
مَرْبَعٌ and مَصِيفُ, both of which are evidently
wrong.]) ―
-b2-  [رَسَمَ often signifies He marked, or
stamped: and he drew, traced, traced out, sketched,
sketched out, or planned: and he delineated, or
described.] You say, رَسَمَ الطَّعَامَ He stamped, or
sealed, the corn; (TA in art. رشم;) as also رَشَمَهُ.
(S, K, TA, all in that art. [See رَوْسَمٌ.]) And
رَسَمْتُ البِنَآءَ, aor. and inf. n. as above, I marked
out the building. (Msb.) And رَسَمَ كِتَابًا وَلَمْ
يَحْشُهُ [He sketched out a book and did not fill it
up]. (Mz 1st نوع.) And رَسَمْتُ الكِتَابَ I wrote
the book, or letter, or writing. (Msb.) And رَسَمَ
عَلَى كَذَا He wrote upon such a thing; (S, K;)
and رَشَمَ is a dial. var. thereof. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence,]
رَسَمَ لَهُ كَذَا, (S, K, TA,) or بِكَذَا, (Msb,) (tropical:)  [He
prescribed to him the doing of such a thing;] he
commanded, ordered, bade, or enjoined, him to do
such a thing. (S, * Msb, * K, TA.) [And رَسَمَ لَهُ
كَذَا also means (assumed tropical:)  he assigned, or appointed, him
such a thing, as a stipend, &c.: often used in this
sense.] ―
-b4-  رَسَمَتْ said of a she-camel, (S, M, K,)
aor.
رَسُمَ (S, M, [and so accord. to a rule of the K,])

vehemence of her tread. (S, M.) ―
-b5-  And رَسَمَ said

رَسِمَ, inf. n. رَسِيمٌ, (S, K,) with
which مِرْسَمٌ is syn., (K,) He went a certain pace,
(S, K,) exceeding that which is termed ذَمِيل
[inf. n. of ذَمَلَ, q. v.]: one should not say of a
camel أَرْسَمَ, for this latter verb is trans. (S.) ―
-b6-
Also رَسَمَ نَحْوَهُ, inf. n. رَسْمٌ, He went, or went
away, quickly towards him, or it. (TA.) ―
-b7-  And
رَسَمَ فِى الأَرْضِ, (K,) inf. n. رَسْمٌ, (TA,) He disappeared in the land, or country: (K:) and
[hence], used metonymically, (tropical:)  he died; like

تَرْسِيمٌ [inf. n. of رَسَّمَ] The act of marking, or
stamping, [and of drawing, tracing, tracing out,
sketching, sketching out, or planning, several things,

or] well: and making a garment, or piece of cloth,
striped. (KL.)
4
ارسم He caused a she-camel to make marks
upon the ground (M, K) by the vehemence of her
tread. (M.) ―
-b2-  And He made a camel to go the
pace termed رَسِيم (S. [The meaning is there
indicated, but not expressed.]) فَأَرْسَمَا ending a
verse of Homeyd Ibn-Thowr [which is variously
related] refers to two boys, or young men, mentioned therein, and means فَأَرْسَمَا بَعِيرَيْهِمَا [And
they made their two camels to go the pace termed
رَسِيم]. (AHát, TA.)
5
ترسّم, (K, but omitted in some copies,) or
ترسّم الرَّسْمَ, (M,) He looked at the رَسْمِ [or mark,
trace, relic, &c.]. (M, K.) And ترسّم الدَّارَ He
considered, or examined, the رُسُوم [or marks,
traces, relics, &c.,] of the house, or dwelling;
(S, TA; *) or did so repeatedly, in order to obtain
a clear knowledge thereof. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And in like
manner ترسّم signifies He looked, and considered,
or examined, or did so repeatedly, in order to
know where he should dig, or build. (S, TA.)
Hence, تَرَسَّمَتِ القَنَافِذُ فِى الأَرْضِ (tropical:)  The hedge-hogs
looked, or considered, or examined, repeatedly, to
know where they should make their holes. (TA.)
And ترسّم الشَّىْءَ (assumed tropical:)  He looked, or looked long, at

thing, but am not sure, or certain, of it. (TA.)
8
اِرْتِسَامٌ [in its primary sense, as quasi-pass.
of رَسْمٌ, inf. n. of رَسَمَ, is app. post-classical, but,
as such,] is used by the logicians as meaning The
being stamped and depicted [in the mind]: (“ Dict.
of the Technical Terms used in the sciences of
the Musalmans: ”] an image's being fixed in, or
upon, a thing. (KL.) [It is used, in this sense,
of an image formed by the fancy, and of any ideal
image.]
-A2-  [Also (tropical:)  The obeying a prescript or
command &c.] You say, رَسَمْتُ لَهُ كَذَا, (S, K,)
or بِكَذَا, (Msb,) فَارْتَسَمَ, (Msb, K,) or فَارْتَسَمَهُ,
(S,) (tropical:)  [I prescribed to him the doing of such a
thing; or] I commanded, ordered, bade, or enjoined, him to do such a thing, (K, TA,) and he
obeyed (S, Msb, TA) it [i. e. the prescript &c.].
(S, Msb.) And ↓ أَنَا أَرْتَسِمُ مَرَاسِمَكَ (tropical:)  [I obey thy
prescripts &c.;] I do not transgress thy مراسم.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And hence, (TA,) ارتسم signifies also
(tropical:)  He said اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرْ [God is great, or most great]:
(S, M, K, TA:) and he sought protection or preservation [by God]: (M, K, TA;) and he prayed
or supplicated or petitioned [God]: (S, K:) as
though [meaning] he took the course prescribed
by God, of having recourse to Him for protection
or preservation. (TA.) El-Aashà says, [speaking
of wine,]
وَصَلَّى عضلَى دَنِّهَا وَارْتَسَمْ  وَقَابَلَهَا الرِيحَ فِى دَنِّهَا
(S, M, TA,) or وَأَقْبَلَهَا, (so in some copies of the
S in this art. and in art. صلو, and in the Mgh,
also, in the latter art.,) i. e. [And he exposed it to
the wind, in its jar, and he prayed over its jar,]
and petitioned for it (TA in this art. and in art.
صلو) that it might not become sour, nor spoil:
(TA in the latter art.:) AHn says that ارتسم
means he stamped its vessel with the رَوْسَم; but
this saying is not valid: (M, TA:) [and Mtr,
also, says that] ارتسم, here, is from الرَّوْسَمُ, and
means he stamped it. (Mgh in art. صلو.)
رَسْمٌ inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (Msb, &c.) ―
