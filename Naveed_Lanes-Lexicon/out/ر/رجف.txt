رَجْفٌ and رَجَفَانٌ (O, Msb, K) and رَجِيفٌ (Msb,
K) and رُجُوفٌ; (O, K;) [and ↓ ارجف; (see the

in a state of motion, commotion, (O, Msb, K,)
agitation, convulsion, tumult, or disturbance:
(Msb, K: *) or in a state of violent motion, commotion, agitation, &c.; (K;) as the camel beneath
the saddle, and the tree when put in motion by
the wind, and the wabbling tooth, and the like.
(O.) You say, رَجَفَتِ الأَرْضُ, (S, O, Msb, K,)
aor.
رَجُفَ, inf. n. رَجْفٌ, (S,) The earth quaked; or
was, or became, in a state of motion, commotion,
agitation, &c., (S, O, Msb, K,) as above; (Msb;)
and so ↓ أَرْجَفَت, and ↓ أُرْجِفَت; (K;) [for ارجف is
both intrans. and trans.:] and الرَّجَفَانُ signifies
the being in a state of violent commotion, agitation, convulsion, tumult, or disturbance. (S.)
And رَجَفَتْ يَدُهُ His arm, or hand, trembled, by

into a state of motion, commotion, or agitation;
(O, K;) [so too, app., رَجَفَ بِهِ;] see 4, last sentence; [and so ↓ أَرْجَفَ; for] أَرْجَفَ الأَرْضَ بِهِمْ is
said of God [as meaning He made the earth to
quake with them]. (TA in art. دم.) And one
says also, رَجَفَتْهُ الحُمَّى The fever caused him to

-b2-  [Hence,] ارجف بِكَذَا [originally He
put another, or others, into a state of commotion,
or agitation, by such a thing; meaning] he told
of such a thing without truth, or not according
to the true, or real, state of the case: [because
he thereby caused commotion, or agitation; or]

thing]: (S, O, K:) or they told many evil tales,
and uttered many discordant lying sayings, respecting the thing, in order that the people might
become in a state of commotion, agitation, convulsion, tumult, or disturbance, in consequence
thereof: whence, in the Kur [xxxiii. 60],
فِى المَدِينَةِ ↓ وَالمُرْجِفُونَ [and they who tell many
evil tales, &c., in the city:] (O, * Msb:) or
ارجفوا فِى البَلَدِ بِكَذَا they told, in the town, or
country, of such a matter, in order that they
might cause commotion, or agitation, &c., to
befall the people, without there being aught
[thereof] true in their estimation; from الرَّجَفَانُ
signifying “ violent commotion or agitation ” &c.
(Har pp. 218, 219.) And ارجفوا, alone, They
said what was false (خَاضُوا) in [relating] tales
of conflicts and factions, or seditions, or discords,

-b2-  سَحَابٌ رَجُوفٌ Clouds in
commotion with thunder, or with much water. (O.)
الرَّجَّافُ The sea; because of its commotion, or

Matrood Ibn-Kaab, lamenting the death of ' Abdel-Muttalib, (IB, O,) the grandfather of the Prophet, and eulogizing him, (IB,)
اَلْمُطْعِمُونَ الشَّحْمَ كُلَّ عَشِيَّةٍ

to a she-camel or the like, occurs, accord. to
Freytag, in the Deewán el-Hudhaleeyeen, as
meaning Moving the head in going along.]
الرَّاجِفَةُ, in the Kur lxxix. 6, means The first
blast [of the horn on the day of resurrection]:
and الرَّادِفَةُ, in the next verse, “the second blast: ”
(O, Bd, Jel, K:) or the former means the motionless bodies that shall be in a state of violent motion
at the time here spoken of, such as the earth and
the mountains; because of the saying in the Kur
[lxxiii. 14], يَومَة تَرْجُفُ الْأَرْضُ وَالْجِبَالُ: CCC and the
latter, “the heaven, and the stars, which shall be
cleft and scattered. ” (Bd.)
إِرْجَافٌ inf. n. of 4 [q. v.]. (Msb.) [And hence,

You say, وَقَعُوا فِى أَرَاجِيفَ [They fell into convulsing perplexities, arising from evil and discordant and false rumours or the like]. (AA, S
and K in art. تع.)
المُرْجِفَانِ The basin and ewer (الطَّسْتُ وَالإِبْرِيقُ)
[that are used for washing the hands before and
after a meal]: because they produce a sound
when one of them is knocked against the other:
as though that sound told of the completion of
the meal, and excited [the persons that had
partaken thereof] to rise. (Har p. 228.) ―
