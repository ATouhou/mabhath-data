plant is about to appear, the earth rises thereat.
(M, TA.) And you say also, رَبَأَ عَلَى جَبَلٍ and

I exalted thee [or held thee] above such a thing:
(M:) and رَبَأْتُ بِكَ أَرْفَعَ الأَمْرِ I exalted thee [in
the highest degree]: (IJ, M:) and رَبَأْتُ بِنَفْسِى

الأَمْرِ Verily I exalt thee [or hold thee] above this
thing, (S, Har ubi suprà, TA,) and do not approve
of it for thee: (Har, TA:) as though properly
signifying I betake myself with thee to an elevated place of observation, in honour of thee, and
in care, or solicitude, for thee, and preserve thee
and keep watch for thee as a scout and a watchman: (Har ubi suprà:) [this usage of the verb,
as is shown in the TA, is what is meant by its
being said that] رَبَأَ is also syn. with رَفَعَ. (K.)
―

care of, (TA,) and put into a good, or right,

ربّأهُ, inf. n. تَرْبِئَةٌ, He made it to pass away;

in the K, ↓ رَبَأَ is likewise mentioned, in an earlier
part of the art., as meaning أَذْهَبَ; but the context in the K compared with that in the Tekmileh
seems to show that this is a mistake. (TA.)

he guarded (حَارَسَ, T, M, K) men, (M,) or a

[In one of my copies of the S, رَبَأْتُ الشَّىْءَ مَرْبَأَةً
is erroneously put for رَابَأْتُ الشىء مُرَابَأَةً.])

أَرْبَاَ see 1, in two places, near the beginning:
-A2-  and see also 3.

رَبْأَةٌ, (K,) written by El-Munáwee رَبَأَةٌ, but it is
not certain, (TA,) The [kind of leathern vessel
for water called] إِدَاوَة that is made of four
skins; (K;) made of four skins because of its
largeness. (MF.)
رَبَآءٌ [High ground]. You say أَرْضٌ لَا رَبَآءَ فِيهَا
وَلَا وَطَآءَ, with medd in each case, [A land in
which is no high ground nor low ground.] (T.)
رَبِىْءٌ: see what next follows, in two places.
رَبِيْئةٌ (T, S, M, O, K) and ↓ رَبِىْءٌ (S, O) and
↓ مُرْتَبِىءٌ (T in art. رمى) A scout; (T, S, M, O,
K;) but only (O, TA) such as is stationed upon
a mountain or some elevated spot, (T, * O, TA,)
whence he looks out: (O, TA:) [perhaps also
signifying scouts; for the word طَلِيعَةٌ by which
the first is explained in the S and M and O and
K, and the second also in the S and O, means
“ a scout ” and “ scouts: ”] pl. [of the first]
رَبَايَا. (S, O.) The first is fem. because the
طليعة is also called عَيْنٌ, and عين is fem.: but
Sb states that this last word in the sense of طليعة
is masc. and fem.; fem. originally, and masc. as
being turned from [the signification of] a part
[i. e. an eye] to [that of] the whole [person].
(M.) AA cites, as an ex. of ↓ رَبِىْءٌ
فَأَرْسَلْنَا أَبَا عَمْرٍو رَبِيْئًا
[And we sent Aboo-' Amr as a scout]: (TA:)
from a poem of 'Abd-Esh-Shárik El-Juhanee.
(Ham pp. 218 et seqq.)
رَابِىءُ الضُّرَبَآءِ [The superintendent, or supervisor,
of the players at the game called المَيْسِر, whose
place is behind them]. (TA in art. رقب.)
مَرْبَأٌ and ↓ مَرْبَأَةٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ مُرْتَبَأٌ (S, K)
and ↓ مِرةبَآءٌ (TA as from the K [but not in the CK
nor in my MS. copy of the K]) An elevated
place of observation, or upon which a person is
stationed to watch; (S, K;) the place of the رَبِيْئَة
[or scout]. (M.) ―
-b2-  And hence, the first of these
words, (S,) or ↓ the second, (T, M,) The مَنَارَة
[or perch], (T,) or place, (S, M,) of the hawk,
or falcon, (T, S, M,) upon which he stands, (S,)
or upon which he mounts. (M.) A rájiz suppresses the ء, saying,
مُقَيَّدَا ↓ بَاتَ عَلَى مَرْبَاتِهِ
[He passed the night upon his perch, shackled].
(T.)
مَرْبَأَةٌ and مَرْبَاةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in three places.
مَرْبَآءٌ, (M, and so in copies of the K,) accord.
to IAar, with medd and fet-h, (M,) or ↓ مِرْبَآءٌ,
(M, and so in the K accord. to the TA,) the
latter preferred by Th, (M,) A stair, or ladder.
