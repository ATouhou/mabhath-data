-b4-  And (tropical:)  He feared him;
(A;) and so ↓ راقبهُ; (S, A, Mgh;) namely, God;
(S, Mgh;) فِى أَمْرِهِ [in his affair]; (S;) because
he who fears looks for, or expects, punishment

land, on the condition that it should be the property of the survivor of them two; saying, If I
die before thee, it shall be thine; and if thou die
before me, it shall be mine: (S:) it is from
المُرَاقَبَةُ; because each of the two persons looks
for (يَرْقُبُ) the death of the other; (S, Mgh,
Msb;) in order that the property may be his:
(Msb:) the subst. is ↓ رُقْبَى [signifying, as a
quasi-inf. n., the act explained above; and, as a
subst. properly so termed, the thing given in the
manner explained above: the verb being similar
to أَعْمَرَ; and the subst., in both of its applications,

رِقْبَةٌ: see 1, first sentence: ―
-b2-  and again, in
the latter half of the paragraph. [Hence,]
وَرِثَ فُلَانٌ مَالًا عَنْ رِقْبَةٍ (tropical:)  Such a one inherited
property from distant relations; not from his
fathers. (K, TA.) And وَرِثَ المَجْدَ عَنْ رِقْبَةٍ
(tropical:)  He inherited glory, or nobility, from distant
relations: [it is said of a man] because it is
feared that it will not be conceded to him on
account of the obscurity of his lineage. (A.)
El-Kumeyt says,
كَانَ السَّدَى وَالنَّدَى مَجْدًا وَمَكْرُمَةً
تِلْكَ المَكَارِمُ لَمْ يُورَثْنَ عِنْ رِقَبِ
(tropical:)  [The night-dew and the day-dew that nourished
his mental growth were nobility and generous
disposition: those generous qualities were not
inherited from distant relations: رِقَبٌ being pl.
of رِقْبَةٌ]: i. e., he inherited them from near
ancestors. (TA.)
رَقَبَةٌ The neck: or the base of the hinder part
thereof: (A, K:) or the hinder part of the base
of the neck: (JK, S:) or the upper part of the
neck: (TA:) pl. [of mult.] رِقَابٌ (JK, S, Msb,
K) and [coll. gen. n.] ↓ رَقَبٌ (JK, S, K) and [pl.
of pauc.] أَرْقُبٌ (IAar, K) and رَقَبَاتٌ. (S, Msb,
K.) ―
-b2-  By a synecdoche, it is applied to (tropical:)  The
whole person of a human being: as in the saying,
ذَنْبُهُ فِى رَقَبَتِهِ (tropical:)  [His sin, or crime, &c., be on his
own neck; meaning, on himself]. (IAth, TA.)
[Hence also] one says, هٰذَا الأَمْرُ فِى رِقَابِكُمْ (tropical:)  [This
affair is upon your own selves], and فِى رَقَبَتِكَ
(tropical:)  [upon thine own self]. (A.) And أَعْتَقَ اللّٰهُ رَقَبَتَهُ
(tropical:)  [May God emancipate him]. (A.) And لَكَ
رِقَابُهُنَّ وَمَا عَلَيْهِنَّ, in a trad., relating to camels,
(tropical:)  They themselves, and the burdens that are upon
them, are thine. (TA.) And [hence], in another
trad., لَنَا رِقَابُ الأَرْضِ (tropical:)  To us belongs the land
itself. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Hence also, i. e. by a synecdoche, (IAth, Mgh, TA,) (tropical:)  A slave, (S, IAth,
Mgh, K, TA,) male and female: (IAth, TA:)
and a captive: (TA:) pl. رِقَابٌ. (Mgh.) You
say, أَعْتَقَ رَقَبَةً (tropical:)  He emancipated a slave, male or
female. (IAth, TA.) And فَكَّ رَقَبَةً (tropical:)  He released
a slave, or a captive. (TA.) الرِّقَاب in the Kur
ix. 60 means (tropical:)  Those slaves who have contracted
with their owners for their freedom. (T, Mgh,
Msb, TA.) ―
-b4-  رِقَابُ المَزَاوِدِ (tropical:)  [lit. The necks of
provision-bags] is a nickname which was applied
to the عَجَم [or Persians, or foreigners in general]; because they were red; (S, A;) or because
of the length of their necks; (El-Karáfee, TA in
art. زود;) or rather because of the thickness
thereof, as though they were full. (MF in that
art.)
رُقْبَى One's giving to another person a possession, (K,) such as a house, and land, and the like,
(TA,) on the condition that, whichever of them
shall die, the property shall revert to his [the
giver's] heirs: (K:) so called because each of
them looks for (يَرْقُبُ) the death of the other:
(TA:) or one's assigning it, (K,) namely, a
dwelling, (TA,) to another person to inhabit, and,
when he shall die, to another: (K:) or one's
saying to a man, If thou die before me, my
dwelling [or my land, which I give to thee,]
shall revert to me; and if I die before thee, it
shall be thine: so called for the reason above
mentioned. (JK, KT. *) [It also signifies The
property so given.] See 4, in three places. The
act thus termed is forbidden in a trad., which
pronounces that the property so given belongs to
the giver's heirs. (JK.) Accord. to the Imám
Aboo-Haneefeh, and [the Imám] Mohammad, it
is not a هِبَة: accord. to Aboo-Yoosuf, it is a هِبَة
like the عُمْرَى; but none of the lawyers of El-
'Irák says so: the Málikees absolutely forbid it.
(TA.) You say, دَارِى لَكَ رُقْبَى [My house is
thine as a رقبى]: from المُرَاقَبَةُ; because each of
the two persons looks for the death of the other.
(A.)
رَقَبَانٌ: see أَرْقَبُ.
رَقَبَانِىٌّ: see أَرْقَبُ.
رَقُوبٌ (tropical:)  A woman (S, A) of whom no offspring
lives, or remains, (S, A, K,) and who looks for
the death of her offspring, or of her husband
[app. that she may have offspring by another]:
(A:) and in like manner applied to a man: (S:)
because he, or she, looks for the death of the
child, in fear for it: (IAth, TA:) in like manner
also a she-camel of which no offspring lives:
(TA:) or he who has no offspring: (Msb:) or
he who has not sent before him [to Paradise, by
its dying in infancy,] any of his children: this,
says A'Obeyd, is the meaning in the [classical]
language of the Arabs; relating only to the loss
of children: (TA:) he who has had no child die
in infancy: or he who has had children and has
died without sending before him any of them [to
Paradise, by its dying in infancy]. (So in the
explanations of two trads., each commencing
with الرَّقُوبُ, in the “ Jámi' es-Sagheer ” of EsSuyootee.)
وَرِثْتُهُ عَنْ عَمَّةٍ رَقُوبِ
is a prov., expl. by Meyd as meaning [I inherited
it from a paternal aunt] of whom no offspring
was living: such, he says, is most compassionate
to the son of her brother. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also A
woman who looks for the death of her husband,
(S, K,) in order that she may inherit his property. (S.) ―
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  An old and a poor man
who is unable to earn for himself, and has none
to earn for him: so called because he looks for a
benefaction or gratuity. (Msb.) ―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A she-camel that does not draw near to the wateringtrough, or tank, on account of the pressing, or
crowding [of the other camels to it], (S, K,) by
reason of her generous disposition: (S:) so called
because she waits for the others to drink, and
drinks when they have done. (TA.) ―
-b5-  أُمُّ الرَّقُوبِ
(assumed tropical:)  Calamity, or misfortune. (K.)
رَقِيبٌ, of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the
measure فَاعِلٌ, (TA,) A looker, watcher, or
waiter, in expectation [of a person or thing]:
(S, Msb, K:) pl. رُقَبَآءُ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  A guarder,
guardian, keeper, or preserver: (JK, S, A, Msb,
K:) a guard of a people; one stationed on an
elevated place to keep watch: (TA:) a spy, or
scout, of an army: (A, TA:) a watcher, or an
observer. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence,] الرّقِيبُ is an appel-lation applied to God; (A, K, TA;) meaning
The Guardian, Keeper, Watcher, or Observer,
from whom nothing is hidden. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Also
The أَمِين of the players at the game called المَيْسِر;
(JK, K;) or (K) he who is intrusted with the
supervision of the ضَرِيب [or shuffler of the
arrows]: (JK, S, K:) or the man who stands
behind the حُرْضَة [q. v.] in the game above mentioned: the meanings of all these explanations
are [said to be] the same: pl. as above. (TA.)
―
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  The third of the arrows used in the
game above mentioned: (T, S, K:) it is one of
the seven arrows to which lots, or portions,
appertain: (TA:) by some it is called الضَّرِيبُ:
(Lh, L in art. ضرب:) the arrows are ten in number: the first is الفَذُّ, which has one notch and
one portion; the second, التَّوْءَمُ, which has two
notches and two portions; the third, الرَّقِيبُ,
which has three notches and three portions; the
fourth, الحِلْسُ or الحَلِسُ, which has four notches
[and four portions]; the fifth, النَّافِسُ, which has
five notches [and five portions]; the sixth, المُسْبِلُ,
which has six notches [and six portions]; and
the seventh, المُعَلَّى, the highest of all, which has
seven notches and seven portions: those to which
no portions appertain are السَّفِيحُ and المَنِيحُ and
الوَغْدُ. (TA.) A poet says,
إِذَا قَسَمَ الهَوَى أَعْشَارَ قَلْبِى
فَسَهْمَاكِ المُعَلَّى وَالرَّقِيبُ
[When love divides the tenths of my heart, thy
two arrows will be the mo'allà and the rakeeb]:
by the سَهْمَانِ, [which properly signifies two
arrows, and hence (assumed tropical:)  two portions gained by two
gaming-arrows, and then (assumed tropical:)  any two portions,] he
means her eyes: and as the معلّى has seven
portions and the رقيب has three, the سهمان would
gain the whole of his heart. (TA. [See also a
verse cited voce عُشْرٌ.]) ―
-b6-  رَقِيبُ النَّجْمِ signifies
(tropical:)  The star, or asterism, that sets with the rising
of that [other] star, or asterism: for example,
the رقيب of الثُّرَيَّا is الإِكْلِيلُ: [and the former is
the رقيب of the latter:] when the latter rises at
nightfall, the former sets: (S, TA:) or رَقِيبٌ
signifies the star, or asterism, which [as it were]
watches, (يُرَاقِبُ,) in the east, the star, or asterism,
setting in the west: or any one of the Mansions
of the Moon is the رقيب of another: (K, TA:)
whenever any one of them rises, another [of
them] sets: (TA: [see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل;
and see also نَوْءٌ:]) and الرَّقِيبُ is (assumed tropical:)  a [certain]
star, or asterism, of the stars, or asterisms, [that
were believed to be the givers] of rain, that [as it
were] watches another star, or asterism: (K:)
[it was app. applied to الإِكْلِيلُ, as being the
رقيب of the most noted and most welcome of all
the Mansions of the Moon, namely, الثُّرَيَّا: see
نَوْءٌ.] The رَقِيب of الثُّرَيَّا is [also] an appellation
applied to الدَّبَرَانُ (assumed tropical:)  [i. e. The Hyades; or the
five chief stars of the Hyades; or the brightest
star among them,
α of Taurus]; because a
follower thereof: (A:) [and] العَيُّوقُ (assumed tropical:)  [i. e. Capella] is so called as being likened to the رقيب of
the game called المَيْسِر. (TA.) [Hence,] one
says, لَاآتِيكَ أَوْ يَلْقَى الثُّرَيَّا رَقِيبُهَا (tropical:)  [I will not
come to thee unless their رقيب meet the Pleiades].
(A.) ―
-b7-  رَقِيبٌ also signifies (tropical:)  A man's successor,
(A, K,) of his offspring, and of his عَشِيرَة [i. e.

saying, نِعْمَ الرَّقِيبُ أَنْتَ لِأَبِيكَ وَسَلَفِكَ (tropical:)  [Excellent,
or most excellent, is the successor; such art thou
to thy father and thine ancestors]: because the
successor is like الدَّبَرَان to الثُّرَيَّا. (A.) ―
-b8-  And
(assumed tropical:)  The son of a paternal uncle. (K.) [App.
because two male cousins by the father's side are
often rivals, and watchers of each other; the son
of a girl's paternal uncle being commonly preferred as her husband.] ―
-b9-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A species of
serpent: as though it watched by reason of
hatred: (TA:) or a certain malignant serpent:
pl. رَقِيبَاتٌ and رُقُبٌ. (T, K.)
رَقَّابَةٌ A low, or an ignoble, man, a servant, or a
slave, syn. رَجُلٌ وَغْدٌ, (S, K,) who keeps, guards,
or watches, the [utensils and furniture called]
رَحْل of a people when they are absent. (S.)
أَرْقَبُ and ↓ رَقَبَانِىٌّ, (JK, S, A, K,) the latter
irregular (Sb, S, K) as a rel. n., (Sb,) and ↓ رَقَبَانٌ,
(IDrd, K,) applied to a man, (S, IDrd, A,)
Thick, (JK, S, K,) or large, (A, Mgh, in which
latter only the second epithet is mentioned,) in
the رَقَبَة [or neck, &c.]: (JK, S, A, K:) the fem.
[of the first] is رَقْبَآءُ, (JK, IDrd,) applied to a
female slave, (JK,) not applied to a free woman,
nor does one say رَقَبَانِيَّةٌ. (IDrd.) ―
-b2-  الأَرْقَبُ is

because of the thickness of his رَقَبة. (TA.)

which a spy, or watchman, ascends, or stations
himself: (S, A, * Msb, K: *) [a structure such as
is termed] an عَلَم, or a hill, upon which one
ascends to look from afar: or, accord. to Sh, the
latter signifies a place of observation on the top
of a mountain or of a fortress: accord. to AA,
the pl., مَرَاقِبُ, signifies elevated pieces of ground.
(TA.)
مَرْقَبَةٌ: see what next precedes.
مُرَقَّبٌ A skin, or hide, that is drawn off from
the part next to the head (S, K) and the رَقَبَة [or
neck, &c.]. (S.)
