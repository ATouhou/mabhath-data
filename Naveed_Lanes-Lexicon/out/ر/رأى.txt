رأىرَأَى, (S, M, &c.,) for which some say رَا [suppressing the ء and the ى,] (M,) and some say
رَآءَ, (T in art. بوأ, and M and K in art. ريأ,) like
خَافَ, (TA in the latter art.,) formed by transposition, (T in art. بوأ,) first pers. رَأَيْتُ, (M,
Msb, K, &c.,) for which some say رَيْتُ, without ء, (T, S, M,) but the former is that which is
general and preferred, (T, M,) aor. يَرَى (T, S,
M,) for which يَرْأَى, agreeably with the root, is
said by none except [the tribe of] Teym-erRibáb, (T, M,) or by such as require this form
in poetry, (S,) sec. pers. fem. sing. and pl., alike,
تَرَيْنَ, so that you say تَرَيْنَنِى [with an affixed
pronoun], and if you will you may say تَرَيْنِّى,
incorporating one ن into the other by teshdeed,
(S,) imperative رَ and إِرْءَ (AZ, T, S, M,) the
people of El-Hijáz saying رَ dual رَيَا, pl. masc.
رَوْا and fem. رَيْنَ, and Teym saying اِرْءَ &c.,
(T, M,) inf. n. رُؤْيَةٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and رِيَّةٌ,
(T, M, K,) the former being altered to رُوْيَةٌ and
then to رُيَّةٌ and then to رِيَّةٌ, (T, M,) and رَأْىٌ
(T, S, K) and رَآءَةٌ, (S, M, K, [in the CK رَأَة,])
like رَاعَةٌ [in measure], (S,) in which the ة is not
necessarily a restrictive to unity, (M,) and رَايَةٌ
(K [but this I do not find elsewhere]) and رِئْيَانٌ,
(Lh, M, TA,) for which last we find in the copies
of the K رُؤْيَان, (TA,) He saw [a person or
thing] with the eye: (S:) in this sense the verb
has [only] one objective complement: (S, Msb:)
you say, رَأَيْتُهُ (T, M, Msb, K) and ↓ اِستَرْأَيْتُهُ,
(T, M, K,) for which some say اِسْتَرَيْتُهُ, (T, M,)
and ↓ اِرْتَأَيْتُهُ, (T, M, K,) for which some say اِرْتَيْتُهُ,
(T, M,) all signifying the same, (T, M, K,) I
saw him, or it, (a person and a thing, Msb) with
the eye; (T, M, Msb, K, TA;) [or so,] and also,
with the mind. (M and K in relation to the first,
and K in relation to all.) رُؤْيَةٌ is of several sorts:
(TA:) first, it signifies The seeing with the eye:
(M, K, TA:) and with what serves for the same
purpose as the organ of sight; as in the saying in
the Kur [ix. 106], وَقُلِ اعْمَلُوا فَسَيَرَىاللّٰهُ عَمَلَكُمْ
[And Say thou, Work ye, for God will see your
work]; because the sense of sight cannot be attributed to God: (TA:) [and similar to this is the
phrase, رَأَى فِيهِ كَذَا He saw in him such a
thing: and رَأَى مِنْهُ كَذَا He experienced from
him such a thing.] Secondly, The seeing by supposition, or fancy; as in the saying, أَرَى أَنَّ
زَيْدًا مُنْطَلِقٌ [I suppose, or fancy, that Zeyd is
going away]. (TA.) Thirdly, The seeing by reflection, or consideration; as in the saying [in
the Kur viii. 50], إِنِّى أَرَى مَا لَا تَرَوْنَ [Verily
I see by reflection, or consideration, what ye see
not]. (TA.) Fourthly, The seeing with the mind,
or mentally; [the opining, or judging, a thing;
a sense in which the inf. n. رَأْىٌ is more commonly used;] (M, * K, * TA;) as in the saying
in the Kur [liii. 11], مَا كَذَبَ الفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى [The
heart did not belie what he mentally saw]. (TA.)
[Of these meanings, other exs. here follow; with
exs. of similar meanings.] ―
-b2-  An ex. of رَا for رَأَى
occurs in the saying of a poet,
مَنْ رَا مِثْلَ مَعْدَانَ بْنِ َحْيَى
[Who has seen the like of Maadán the son of
Yahyà? the measure being وَافِر, with the first
foot reduced to مُفْعَلْتُنْ]. (M.) الحَمْدُلِلّٰهِ عَلَى
رِيَّتِكِ, for رُؤْيَتِكَ, altered in the manner explained
above, [meaning Praise be to God for the seeing
of thee,] (M, K, *) is a saying mentioned by
IAar. (M.) صُومُوا لِرُؤْيَتِهِ means [Fast ye] at the
time of seeing it; [referring to the new moon of
Ramadán;] i. e., when ye see it. (Mgh.) In the
phrase رَأَيْتُهُ قَائِمًا [I saw him standing], قائما is
in the accus. case as a denotative of state. (Msb.)
رَأْىُ عَيْنِى زَيْدًا فَعَلَ ذَاكَ [My eye saw (lit. my
eye's seeing) Zeyd do that] is held by Sb to be an
instance of an anomalous use of an inf. n., and
is [said to be] the only instance of the kind,
among inf. ns. of trans. verbs except سَمْعُ أُذُنِى.
(M, TA: but in a copy of the former written
رَأْىَ عينى and سَمْعَاذنى.) رَأَيْتُهُ رَأْىَ العَيْنِ means
[I saw him, or it,] where the eye, or sight, fell
upon him, or it. (TA.) بِعَيْنٍ مَّا أَرَيَنَّكَ [lit. With
some eye I will assuredly see thee] is a saying
mentioned by AZ as meaning hasten thou, (اِعْجَلْ
thus in copies of the S and in the TA, or عَجِّلْ as
in one copy of the S,) or work thou, (اِعْمَلْ, thus
in two copies of the S,) and be as though I were
looking at thee: (S, TA:) it is said to one whom
you send, and require to be quick; and means
pause not for anything, for it is as though I were
looking at thee. (TA in art. عين.) رَأَى المَكَانُ
المَكَانَ (tropical:)  The place faced [or (as we say) looked
upon] the place, as though seeing it, (M, TA,) is
tropical: (TA:) [and in like manner you say,]
دَارِى تَرَى دَارَهُ (tropical:)  My house faces [or looks upon]
his house. (T, IAth, TA.) ―
-b3-  رَأَىفِى مَنَامِهِ رُؤْيَا
[He saw, i. e. fancied that he saw, in his sleep, a
vision, or dream]. (S, Msb, K. *) ―
-b4-  أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى
كَذَا [Has thou not considered such a thing, so
as to be admonished thereby?] is a phrase used
on an occasion of wonder (IAth, K, TA) at a
thing, and in rousing the attention of the person
to whom it is addressed; as in the saying in the
Kur [ii. 244], أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ خَرَجُوا مِنْ دِيَارِهِمْ
[Hast thou not considered those who went forth
from their houses, so as to be admonished by
their case?]; meaning, hast thou not wondered
at their act, and has not their case come to thy
knowledge? and so in other instances in the
same: (IAth, TA:) Er-Rághib says that, when
رَأَيْت is made trans. by means of إِلَى, it denotes
consideration that leads to the becoming admonished. (TA.) In like manner also, (IAth, K,)
أَرَأَيْتَكَ and أَرَأَيْتَكُمَا and أَرَأَيْتَكُمْ, (T, IAth, K,) and
to a woman أَرَأَيْتَكِ, and to a pl. number of women
أَرَأَيْتَكُنَّ, (T,) [which may be lit. rendered Hast
thou, and have ye two, &c., considered?] are expressions used to arouse attention, (IAth, TA,)
meaning tell thou me and tell ye two me &c.;
(T, IAth, K;) as in the saying in the Kur
[xvii. 64], قَالَ أَرَأَيْتَكَ هٰذَا الَّذِى كَرَّمْتُ عَلَىَّ [He
said, Hast thou considered? meaning tell me,
respecting this whom Thou hast honoured above
me]; and in the same [vi. 40 and 47], قَلْ أَرَأَيْتَكُمْ
إِنْ أَتَاكُمْ عَذَابُ اللّٰهِ [Say thou, Have ye considered? meaning tell me, if the punishment of
God come upon you]; and occurring without the
ك in other places thereof: (IAth, TA:) you say
also, أَرَأَيْتَ زَيْدًا and أَرَأَيْتَكَ زَيْدًا, meaning Tell
thou me [respecting Zeyd]: (Mgh:) and for
أَرَأَيْتَ and أَرَأَيْتَكَ [&c.] some say أَرَيْتَ and أَرَيْتَكَ:
(S:) the pronunciation without ء is the more
common: the ت in أَرَأَيْتَكَ &c. is always with
fet-h; and accord. to the grammarians of accredited science, the ك in these cases is redundant;
(T;) [i. e.] it is a particle of allocution, to corroborate the pronoun [ت, which it therefore immediately follows in every case, distinguishing the
genders and numbers by its own variations, which
are the same as those of the pronominal affix of
the second person]: (Bd in vi. 40:) [IHsh says,]
the correct opinion is that of Sb; that the ت is
an agent, and the ك is a particle of allocution:
(Mughnee in art. ك:) but sometimes أَرَأَيْتَكَ &c.
mean هَلْ رَأَيْتَ نَفْسَكَ &c.; the ك being in this
case an objective complement [and the verb being
differently rendered according as it has not, or
has, a second objective complement, as is shown
here by what precedes and what follows]. (T.)
In أَتُرَاكَ, also, [from ↓ أُرِىَ, not from رُئِىَ,] meaning اتظنّ [i. e. أَتَظُنُّ, Thinkest thou?], the pronoun [as some term it, but properly the final
particle,] is [a particle of allocution] like that in
أَرَأَيْتَكَ in the Kur vi. 40 and 47 [cited above;
and in the same sense as this latter phrase, أَتُرَاكَ
is used, as meaning tell thou me]. (Har p. 570.)
―
-b5-  When رَأَى means He knew, (S, Msb,) or he
thought, (Msb,) it has two objective complements:
(S, Msb:) or when it has two objective complements, it necessarily means knowing [or the like].
(Er-Rághib, TA.) [In this case, رَآهُ may be rendered He saw, or knew, him, or it, to be: and
he thought, or judged, or held, him, or it, to be;
or he regarded, or held, him, or it, as.] You
say, رَأَيْتُ زَيْدًا عَالِمًا, (S, Msb, *) or حَلِيمًا, (M,)
I knew [or saw Zeyd to be learned, or forbearing]; (S, M, Msb;) as though seeing him to
be so with the eye: (M:) and I thought him
[&c.] to be so. (Msb.) In like manner, also,
↓ تَرَآءَيْتُهُ signifies I thought him to be. (Har
p. 211.) يَرَوْنَهُمْ مِثْلَيْهِمْ رَأْىَ العَيْنِ, in the Kur
[iii. 11], means They [who were the unbelievers]
thinking them [who were fighting in the cause of
God] twice as many as they, according to the
evidence of the sight of the eye. (TA.) The pass.
form of رَأَى has [only] one objective complement:
you say, رُئِىَ زَيْدٌ عَاقِلًا, meaning Zeyd was thought
[to be intelligent]: (TA:) and اَلَّذِى أُرَاهُ, with
the verb in the pass. form, means الذىاظنّ [i. e.
أُظَنُّ, He whom I am thought to be; if from
رُئِىَ: or الذىأَظُنُّ, what I think, if from ↓ أُرِىَ:
it is often used in the latter sense]. (Msb.) ―
-b6-
You say also, رَأَى فِى الأَمْرِ رَأْيًا [He formed, or
held, an opinion, or a persuasion, or a belief,
respecting the affair, or case]: (Msb:) and so
فِىالفِقْهِ [in the science of the law]. (S.) And
الَّذِى أَرَاهُ That to which I take, or which I hold, as
my opinion, or persuasion, or belief. (Msb.) And
فُلَانٌ يَرَى رَأْىَ الشُّرَاةِ Such a one holds, or believes,
the tenets, or belief, of the شراة [a certain sect of
schismatics; pl. of شَارٍ]. (M.) When رَأَى is
[thus] used as meaning He held, or believed, it
has [only] one objective complement. (Msb.) ―
-b7-
لَا تَرَ مَا (T, K, TA, [mentioned also in the K in
art. ترم, in which art. in the CK CK it is written
لا تَرْما,]) and لَا تَرَى مَا, and لَوْ تَرَ مَا, and لَوْ تَرَىمَا,
(T, TA, [in copies of the K أَوْتَرَ مَا, which I
think a mistranscription, and for which is put in
the TA, as on the authority of IAar, اذ تر ما,
app. a mistranscription of a mistranscription, i. e.
of اوترما,]) and لَمْ تَرَ مَا, (T, K, TA,) in this
last case with تَرَ [only, agreeably with a general
rule], are forms of expression meaning لَا سِيَّمَا
[i. e., virtually, Above all, or especially]: (T, K,
TA:) you say, إِنَّهُ لَخَبِيثٌ وَلَا تَرَ مَا فُلَانٌ and
وَ لَا تَرَى مَا فُلَانٌ and وَ لَوْ تَرَ مَا فُلَانٌ and وَلَوْ تَرَى
مَا فُلَانٌ and .َلَمْ تَرَ مَا فُلَانٌ [i. e. Verily he is bad,
or base, or wicked; and above all, or especially,
such a one: وَلَا تَرَ مَا فُلَانٌ, or وَلَا تَرَىمَا فُلَانٌ,
properly meaning وَلَا تَرَىمِثْلَ الَّذِى هُوَ فُلَانٌ
and thou will not see the like of him who is such
a one; مِثْلَ and هُوَ being understood: and in like
manner are to be explained the other forms of
expression here mentioned]: in all of these forms,
فلان is in the nom. case: all are mentioned by
Lh, on the authority of Ks. (T, TA.) ―
-b8-  رَأَتْ is
also said of a woman, as meaning She saw what
is termed التَّرْئِيَة and التَّرِيَّة, i. e., a little yellowness
or whiteness  or blood on the occasion of menstruation. (M.)
-A2-  رَأَيْتُهُ [form الرِّئَةُ] I hit, or hurt,
(S, M, Msb, K, *) or struck, or smote, (Er-Rághib,
TA,) his رِئَة [or lungs]: (S, M, Msb, K, Er-Rághib:) and so وَرَيْتُهُ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  And رُئِىَ
He had a complaint of his رِئَة [or lungs]; (M;)
as also ↓ أَرْأَى. (T, K.)
-A3-  رَأَيْتُ رَايَةً I stuck, or
fixed, a banner, or standard, (T in art. رى, and
K in the present art.,) into the ground; (TA;)
as also ↓ أَرَأَيْتُهَا, (T, K,) as some say: (T:) the
latter is mentioned by Lh; but [ISd says,] I
hold that it is anomalous, and is properly only
أَرَيَيْتُهَا. (M in art. رى, and TA.)
-A4-  رَأَىالزَّنْدُ
[like وَرَى and وَرِىَ] The زند [or piece of wood
for producing fire] became kindled. (Kr, M, K.)
―
-b2-  And رَأَيْتُ الزَّنْدَ I kindled the زند. (M, K.)
2
رَأَّيْتُهُ, inf. n. تَرْئِيَةٌ, I held for him, or to him,
(AZ, T, S,) or I showed, or presented, to him,
(M, K,) or I withheld, or retained, or restricted,
for him, [i. e. for his use,] (AZ, * T, * S, * M, K,)
the mirror, in order that he might look in it,
(AZ, T, S, K,) or in order that he might see himself in it; (M;) as also المِرْآةَ ↓ أَرَيْتُهُ. (M.) ―
-b2-
See also 3.
3
رَآءَيْتُهُ, (M, K,) inf. n. مُرَاآةٌ and رِئَآءٌ, (M,)
I faced, so that I saw, him, or it; (M, K;) as
also ↓ تَرَآءَيْتُهُ. (M.) ―
-b2-  Also, inf. ns. as above,
[I acted hypocritically, or with simulation,
towards him;] I pretended to him that I was
otherwise than I really was; (M, K; *) as also
↓ رَأَّيْتُهُ, inf. n. تَرْئِيَةٌ: (K:) both are mentioned by
Fr: (T:) [accord. to J,] رَآءَى فُلَانٌ النَّاسَ, aor.
يُرَائِيهِمْ, inf. n. مُرَاآةٌ, and رَايَاهُمْ, inf. n. مُرَايَاةٌ, the
latter formed by transposition, [which indicates,
though written as above in my copies of the S,
that we should read رَايَأَهُمْ, inf. n. مُرَايَأَةٌ,] signify
the same: (S:) [but it is said in the Mgh that
رَايَا (perhaps thus written for رَايَأَ) in the sense of
رَآءَى is a mistake: and] رَآءَى signifies [he acted
ostentatiously; i. e.] he did a deed in order that
men might see it: (Mgh:) or رِئَآءٌ signifies the
making a show of what one does to men, in order
that they may see it and think well of it: and
the acting otherwise than for the sake of God:
(Msb, TA:) and it is said in the S to be a subst.
[as distinguished from an inf. n.; but why so, I
do not see]. (TA.) Hence, in the Kur [cvii. 6],
اَلَّذِينَ هُمْ يُرَاؤُونَ Who act hypocritically; when
the believers pray, praying with them, pretending
to them that they follow the same way [of religion] as they: (M, TA:) or who make a show of
their works to men, in order to be praised by
them. (Bd.) And مَنْ رَآءَى رَآءَى اللّٰهُ بِهِ He who
does a deed in order that men may see it, God
will expose his doing so on the day of resurrection.
(Mgh) And فَعَلَ ذٰلِكَ رِئَآءً وَسُمْعَةً [He did that
in order to make others to see it and hear of it].
(S.) [See also 4.] ―
-b3-  In the saying of El-Farezdak,
satirizing a people, and charging one of their
women with that which is not comely,
وَ بَاتَ يُرَاآهَا حَصَانًا وَ قَدْ جَرَتْ
لَنَا بُرَتَاهَا بِالَّذِى أَنَ شَاكِرُهْ
[And he passed the night thinking her chaste,
when her two anklets had run to us with that for
which I was thankful], by يُرَاآهَا [with حَصَانًا
following it] he means يَظُنُّ أَنَّهَا حَصَانٌ, i. e.
عَفِيفَةٌ; and by جَرَتْ لَنَا بُرَتَاهَا he means أَنَّهَا أَمْكَنَتْهُ
مِنْ رِجْلَيْهَا حَتَّى غَشِيَهَا. (T.) ―
-b4-  رَآءَيْتُهُ also signifies I consulted with him; or asked his counsel,
or advice: (T, K: *) and فِى الرَّأْىِ ↓ اِسْتَرْأَيْتُهُ I
consulted him, or asked his counsel, or advice,
respecting the opinion. (T, K.) 'Imrán Ibn-
Hittán says,
فَإِنْ نَكُنْ نَحْنُ شَاوَرْنَاكَ قُلْتَ لَنَا
بِالنُّصْحِ مِنْكَ لَنَا فِيمَا نُرَائِيكَا
i. e. [And if we ask thy counsel, or advice, thou
pronouncest to us, with honesty on thy part
towards us, concerning that] respecting which we
ask thy counsel, or advice. (T.)
4
أَرَيْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ, (IAar, T, S, M, K,) originally
أَرَأَيْتُهُ, (S,) inf. n. إِرَآءَةٌ (Sb, IAar, T, M, K) and
إِرَايَةٌ (IAar, T) and إِرَآءٌ, (Sb, IAar, T, M, K,) [the
last originally إِرْأَاءٌ,] the ة in the first inf. n. being
a substitute [for the suppressed أ, and in like
manner in the second], and the last inf. n. being
without any substitution, (Sb, M,) [I made him
to see the thing; i. e. I showed him the thing:]
you say, أَرَيْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ فَرَآهُ [I showed him the thing,
and he saw it[. (S.) See also 8. Aboo-'Amr
read أَرْنَا مَنَاسِكَنَا, [in the Kur ii. 122, for أَرِنَا i. e.
Show Thou to us our religious rites and caremonies of the pilgrimage, or our places where
those rites and ceremonies are to be performed,]
which is anomalous. (M.) ―
-b2-  One says also,
أَرَى اللّٰهُ بِفُلَانٍ, meaning God showed men by
[the example of] such a one punishment and
destruction: (K:) or God showed by [the example of] such a one that which would cause his
enemy to rejoice at his misfortune: a saying of
the Arabs: (T in art. رى:) said only in relation
to evil. (Sh, TA.) ―
-b3-  And أَرِنِى الشَّىْءَ Give thou,
or hand thou, to me the thing. (M, TA.) ―
-b4-  أَرَى
in the sense of أَعْلَمَ [as meaning He made such a
one to know a thing, or person, to be, as in the
saying, أَرَيْتُ زَيْدًا عَمْرًامُنْطَلِقًا I made Zeyd to
know “ Amr to be going away, which may be
rendered I showed Zeyd that 'Amr was going
away,] requires [as this ex. shows] three objective
complements. (M, and Bd in iv. 106. [See I “ AK,
p. 117.]) ―
-b5-  This is not the case in the saying in
the Kur [iv. 106], لِتَحْكُمَ بَيْنَ النَّاسَ بِمَا أَرَاكَ اللّٰهُ;
(M, Bd;) for here it has but two objective complements, namely, the ك in اراك, and the suppressed pronoun هُ in أَرَاكَهُ: it is in this instance
from الرَّأْىُ in the sense of الإِعْتِقَادُ: (M:) the
meaning is, [That thou mayest judge between
men] by means of that which God hath taught
thee, syn. عَرَّفَكَ, (Ksh, Bd,) or عَلَّمَكَ, (Jel,) and
revealed to thee. (Ksh, Bd.) ―
-b6-  See also 1, in
the latter half of the paragraph, in two places, in
which the pass., أُرِىَ, is mentioned.
-A2-  أَرْأَى [as
an intrans. v., preserving the original form, inf. n.
إِرْآءٌ, as below,] He looked in the mirror; (T, K;)
and so فِى المِرْآةِ ↓ تَرَأَّى and فِيهَا ↓ تَرَآءَى: (T, M,
K:) or ↓ تَرَآءَى signifies he (a man) looked at his
face in the mirror or in the sword: (S:) and
فِى المَآءِ ↓ تَمَرْأَى he looked at his face in the
water; the doing of which is forbidden in a trad;
of the measure تَمَفْعَلَ [from المِرْآةُ]; mentioned
by Sb; like تَمَسْكَنَ from المِسْكِينُ, and تَمَدْرَعَ
from المِدْرَعَةُ, and تَمَنْدَلَ from المِنْدِيلُ. (M.) ―
-b2-
He (a man) had many dreams. (T, K. *) ―
-b3-
He moved his eyelids, (K,) or made much motion
with his eyes, (T,) in looking: (T, K:) you say,
هُوَ يُرْئِىبِعَيْنَيْهِ, (TA,) and يُرَأْرِئٌ بِعَيْنَيْهِ. (T,
TA. *) ―
-b4-  He acted (T, K) well, or righteously,
(T,) in order to make others see what he did,
and hear of it. (T, K.) [See also 3.] ―
-b5-  He
possessed, or became possessed of, intelligence
(K, TA) and judgment and forecast: (TA:)
inf. n. إِرْآءٌ. (K, TA. [The inf. n. is mentioned
with this signification, in the K, app. because it
is the first there explained, and therefore as applying to the verb in all its senses.]) ―
-b6-  And He
had the appearance, or evidence, of foolishness,
or stupidity, in his face: (T, K, TA: [the words
by which Az explains this meaning are تَبَيَّنَتْ
آراؤهُ فى وَجْهِهِ وهى الحماقةُ, accord. to one copy
of the T; in another copy of the same, الرؤاه:
the TA follows the former reading: but the right
reading is الرَّأْوَةٌ; mentioned in the T, thus correctly written, in art. رأرأ; in the S, in the present
art; and in the M, in art. رأو, which is its proper
art., and therefore the proper art. of the verb in
the sense thus explained:]) thus it bears two
contr. meanings. (K. [But it is added in the
TA that this requires consideration.]) ―
-b7-  Also
He had what is termed a رَئِىّ, of the jinn, or
genii; (T, K, TA;) i. e., a follower, of the jinn.
(TA.) ―
-b8-  And He followed the opinion, or belief,
of some one, or more, of the lawyers (K, TA) in
the science of the law. (TA.) ―
-b9-  أَرْأَتْ said of a
she-camel and of a ewe or she-goat, (M,) and of
any female in a state of pregnancy, except a solidhoofed animal and a beast of prey, Her udder
showed her to be pregnant: (M, K:) and in like
manner it is said of a woman: (M:) or, said of
a ewe or she-goat, she was, or became, big in her
udder: (S:) and accord. to IAar, said of a she-goat, she was, or became, swollen in her vulva,
and her being so became apparent, or evident.
(M.) And أَرْأَى said of a man, His ewe, or she-goat, was, or became, black in her udder. (T.)
-A3-  See also 1, in two places, near the end of the
paragraph.
-A4-  [It is also said in the K and TA
that أَرأَى, said of a camel, means اِنْتَكَثَ خَطْمُهُ
عَلَى حَلْقِهِ; in the CK انْتَكَبَ; and in the TA
this is said to be on the authority of En-Nadr:
but in a copy of the T, I find it stated, on the
authority of ISh, (i. e. En-Nadr,) that الارآ (i. e.
الإِرْآءُ) signifies انتكاثُ خطم البَعيرِ على حَلْقِه: in
another copy of the T, on the authority of En-Nadr, that الرآ (a mistranscription for الإِرْآءُ) signifies انتكاث خطم البعير خِلقة: and it is added that
the epithet applied to a camel is مُرأى (as in one
copy, i. e. ↓ مُرْأَى, and thus it is written in the
TA, but in the other copy of the T مراْى, an
obvious mistranscription); and to camels, مُرآاتٌ
(as in one copy, for مُرْأَاتٌ, i. e. مُرْآتٌ, in the other
copy of the T erroneously written مُرَأاة, and in
the TA مرايات): therefore the verb is evidently
أُرْئِىَ, in the pass. form, inf. n. إِرْآءٌ; and I think
that the correct explanation is اِنْتَكَثَ خَطْمُهُ خِلْقَةً,
app. meaning His muzzle was thin, or lean, by
nature: see art. نكث: and see also مُرْأًى below.]

the paragraph. ―

تَرَآءَوْا They saw one another: (M, K:) dual

the Kur [xxvi. 61], (TA,) The two bodies of
people saw each other: (S:) or approached and
faced each other so that each was able to see the
other. (TA.) And تَرَآءَيْنَا We met and saw each
other. (A'Obeyd, T.) See also 3, first sentence.
It is said in a trad, (T,) لَاتَرَاآنَاراهُمَا, [for تَتَرَاآ,
as it is written in some copies of the K,] (T, K,)
[i. e. (tropical:)  Their two fires shall not be within sight of
each-other;] meaning that the Muslim may not
dwell in the country of the believers in a plurality
of gods, and be with them so that each of them
shall see the fire of the other: (T, K *) so says
A'Obeyd: or, accord. to AHeyth, it means that
the Muslim may not mark himself with the mark
of the believer in a plurality of gods, nor assimilate himself to him in conduct and guise, nor
assume his manners, or dispositions; from the
phrase مَا نَارُ بَعِيرِكَ, meaning “ What is the brand
of thy camel? ” (T:) IAth explains it similarly to
A'Obeyd; and says that the verb is thus used
tropically. (TA.) ―
-b2-  ترآءى لِى He addressed, or
presented, himself [to my sight, or] in order that
I might see him; as also لى ↓ ترأّى. (M, K.)

jinn, or genii, presented itself to his sight].

eyes towards the new moon in order that we
might see it. (Msb.) [See also 6 in art. نقض.] ―

paragraph.

اِرْتَآهُ [is syn. with رَآهُ as signifying He saw
him, or it, with the eye; and also, with the mind]:
see 1, first sentence: or it is [syn. with رَآهُ in the
latter sense only, being] from الرَّأْىُ and التَّدْبِيرُ:
(S, TA:) or اِرْتَأَى is from رَأْىُ القَلْبِ, (Lth, T,)
or from رُؤْيَةُالقَلْبِ, or from الرَّأْىُ, and means he
thought, reflected, or considered, and acted deliberately, or leisurely. (IAth, TA.) You say,
اِرْتَأَيْنَا فِى الأَمْرِ, and ↓ تَرَآءَيْنَا [i. e. ترآءينا فِيهِ] or
تَرَآءَيْنَاهُ, (accord. to different copies of the K,)
meaning نَظَرْنَاهُ [or نَظَرْنَاهُنَظَرْنَا فيه, i. e. We looked
into, examined, or considered, the affair, or case].
(K.) And اِرْتَآهُ وَاعْتَقَدَهُ [He saw it with his
mind, looked into it, examined it, or considered
it, and believed it]. (Mgh.)

استرآهُ He, or it, called for, demanded, or
required, the seeing of it; (M, K;) i. e., a thing.

Q. Q. 2
تَمَرْأَى: see 4, in the former half of
the paragraph.
رَأْىٌ is an inf. n. of رَأَى [q. v.]: (T, S, K:) [and
is also a subst.: used as a subst.,] it means The
رَأْى of the eye; (Lth, T, Msb;) i. e. the sight
thereof; like رُؤْيَةٌ, q. v.: (Msb:) and also, of the
mind; (Lth, T;) [i. e.,] it signifies also mental
perception: (Msb:) [conception: idea: nation:]
belief; (M, K;) as a subst., not as inf. n.: (M:)
[or judgment: or persuasion: or opinion; i. e.] a
preponderating belief of one of two things that
are inconsistent, each with the other: (Er-Rághib,
TA:) a thing that a man has seen with his mind,
looked into, examined, or considered, (مَا ارْتَآهُ,)
and believed: (Mgh:) [a tenet:] also intelligence:
and forecast: and skill in affairs: (Msb:) [and
hence it often means counsel, or advice:] pl.
أَرْآءٌ (T, S, K &c.) and آرَآءٌ, (S, M, K,) the latter
formed by transposition, [being for أَأْرَآءٌ,] (S,)
and أَرْىءٍ [originally أَرْؤُىٌ, like as أَظْبٍ is originally أَظْبُىٌ,] (Lh, M, K, TA, in some copies of the
K أَرْىٌ) and رُئِىٌّ and رِئِىٌّ [both originally رُؤُوىٌ],
(Lh, M, TA,) in the K رُىٌّ, with damm, [in the
CK رَىٌّ,] and رِىٌّ, with kesr, (TA,) and [quasipl. n.] ↓ رَئِىٌّ, (S, K,) of the measure فَعِيلٌ, like
ضَئِينٌ. (S.) One says, مَاأَضَلَّ رَأْيَهُ [How erroneous is his mental perception, &c.!], and مَاأَضَلَّ
أَرُآهُ [How erroneous are his mental perceptions,
&c.!]. (Lth, T.) أَصْحَابُ الرَّأْىِ, [often meaning
The speculatists, or theorists,] as used by those
who treat of the traditions, means the followers
of analogy; because they pronounce according to
their رَأْى [or belief, &c.,] in relation to that concerning which they have not found any [tradition
such as is termed] حَدِيث or أَثَر, (IAth, K, TA,)
or in relation to that which is dubious to them in
a tradition. (IAth, TA.) But accord. to the
usage of others, one says, فُلَانٌ مِنْ أَهُلِ الرَّأْى
meaning Such a one holds the belief, or opinion,
&c., of the [heretics, or schismatics, called] خَوَارِج,
and says according to their persuasion. (TA.)
[Sometimes, also, this phrase means Such a one
is of the people of intelligence; or of counsel, or
advice.] See also رَئِىٌّ. And رَجُلٌ ذُو رَأْىٍ means
A man having mental perception, and skill in
affairs. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  See also the next paragraph.
أَتَاهُمْ حِينَ جَنَّ رُؤْىٌ and رُؤْيًا and ↓ رَأْىٌ and رَأْيًا
(M, K *) [He came to them] when the darkness
had become confused so that they did not see one
another. (M, K.)
رِئْىٌ, (M, TA,) in the K said to be ↓ رُئِىٌّ, like
صُلِىٌّ, (TA, [but the former is the right, as will
be shown by a citation from the Kur in what
follows,]) and ↓ رُؤَآءٌ and ↓ مَرْآةٌ Aspect, look, or
outward appearance: (M, K:) [and so ↓ رُؤْيَةٌ;
used in this sense in the S and K in explanation
of طَلْعَةٌ:] or the first and second (i. e. رِئْىٌ and
↓ رُؤَآءٌ, M) signify beauty of aspect or outward
appearance; (M, K;) or so does this last; (T,
S;) [and so رُوَآءٌ, with و, mentioned in the S in
art. روى, and there explained as syn. with مَنْظَرٌ;]
and ↓ مَرْآةٌ signifies aspect, or outward appearance,
absolutely, (M, K, *) whether beautiful or ugly:
(M:) or this (مرآة) signifies a beautiful aspect or
outward appearance: and رِئْىٌ signifies what the
eye sees, of goodly condition and clean apparel;
as in the phrase in the Kur [xix. 75], هُمٌ أَحسَنُ
أَثَاثًا وَوِئْيًا [they being better in respect of goods,
or property, and of appearance of goodly condition and outward apparel], accord. to him
who reads it [thus] with ء; and read without ء it
may be from the same, or from رَوِيَتْ أَلْوَانُهُمْ
وَجُلُودُهُمْ meaning “ their colours and skins became full and beautiful ” [or rather “ beautiful
and full ”] : (S:) for Náfi' and Ibn-'Ámir read
رِيًّا, by conversion of the ء [into ى] and incorporating it [into the radical ى], or from الرِّىٌّ
meaning النَّعْمَةُ; and Aboo-Bekr read رِئًا, by
transposition; and another reading is رِيًا, with the
ء suppressed; and another زِيًّا, from الزَّىُّ. (Bd.)
One says ↓ اِمْرَأَةٌ حَسَنَةُ المَرْآةِ and ↓ المَرْأَى [A
woman beautiful of aspect]; like as you say
حَسَنَةُ المَنْظَرَةِ and المَنْظَرِ: (T, S:) and فُلَانٌ حَسَنٌ
العَيْنِ ↓ فِى مَرْآةِ Such a one is beautiful in aspect:
and it is said in a prov., ↓ تُخْبِرُ عَنْ مَجْهُولِهِ مَرْآتُهُ
His outward appearance indicates [what would
otherwise be his unknown character, meaning,]
his inward state. (S.) [See also تَرِئيَةٌ]
رِئَةٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K,) with ء, (T, S, Msb,)
and رِيَةٌ without ء, (T, Msb,) The سَحْر [or lungs,
or lights]; (S;) the place of the breath and wind
(M, K) of a man &c., (M,) [i. e.] of an animal:
(K:) the ة is a substitute for the ى (S, Msb,)
which is suppressed: (Msb:) pl. رِئُونَ, (S, M,
Msb, K,) agreeably with a general rule relating
to words of this class, (M,) and رِئَاتٌ: (M, Msb,
K:) dim. ↓ رُؤَيَّةٌ and رُوَيَّةٌ (T.) Some say that
the suppressed letter [in رِيَةٌ] is و; and that it is
originally وِرْيَةٌ like as عِدَةٌ is originally وِعْدَةٌ:
and وَرَيْتُهُ signifies “ I hit, or hurt, his رِيَة ” (Msb.)
[hence ذَاتُ الرِّئَةِ Inflammation of the lungs.]
رَأْوَةٌ An indication of a thing. (M in art. رأو
[to which it belongs: but in the S and TA mentioned in the present art.; and in the T, in art. رأ:
in one copy of the S written رَآوَةٌ; and in one place
in the TA, written رؤاوة, and said to be like ثُمَامَةٌ,
app. from the author's having found it written
رُآوَةٌ for رَأْوَةٌ].) You say, عَلَى فُلَانٍ رَأْوَةُ الحُمْقِ
[Upon such a one is the indication of foolishness, or
stupidity]. (M.) And عَلَى وَجْهِهِ رَأْوَةُ الحُمْقِ
[Upon his face is the indication of foolishness, or
stupidity], when you know foolishness, or stupidity, to be in him before you test him. (Lh, T,
S.) And إِنَّ فِى وَجْهِهِ لَرَأْوَةً Verily in his face
is an ugliness. (T.) [See also an explanation of
أَرْأَى, above. J seems to have regarded the و as
substituted for ى.]
رَأْيَةٌ, originally thus, with ء; (T, Msb;) but the
Arabs prefer omitting it, [saying رَايَةٌ,] and some
of them say that it has not been heard with ء;
(Msb;) [Az says,] the Arabs did not pronounce
it with ء: accord. to Lth, its radical letters are
رىى: (T:) A banner, or standard, (T, Msb,)
of an army: (Msb:) pl. رَايَاتٌ (T, Msb.) [See
also art. رى.]
رُؤْيَةٌ an inf. n. of رَأَى [q. v.] : (T, S, M, Msb,
K:) [and also a subst.: used a as subst.,) it means
The sight of the eye; as also ↓ رَأْىٌ: [and accord.
to the M and K, it is with the mind also; like
رَأْىٌ:] pl. رُوًى. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  See also رِئْىٌ ―

[i. e.] imperfectly decl., because the ا is that
which is the sign of the fem. gender, (Msb,)
also pronounced رُويَا, without ء, (Fr, T, M,) and
رُيَّا, [which is anomalous, like رُىٌّ, for رِىٌّ,] mentioned by El-Fárisee on the authority of Abu-l-
Hasan, (M,) and رِيَّا, (T, M,) heard by Ks from
an Arab of the desert, (T,) A dream, or vision in
sleep; (T, * S, * M, K;) accord. to most of the
lexicologists, syn. with حُلْمٌ; or the former is
such as is good, and the latter is the contr.: (MF
voce حُلْمٌ, q. v.:) accord. to Lth, it has no pl.;
but accord, to others, (T,) its pl. is رُؤًى, (T, S,
M, K,) with tenween. (S.) One says, رَأَيْتُ
عَنْكَ رُؤًى حَسَنَةً I dreamt, of thee, good dreams.
(M.)

loves, and with whom he becomes familiar: (M:)
or a jinnee that is seen and loved: or the latter word
means such as is loved: (K:) and the former
word, some other than this: (TA:) or the former
means a follower, who is of the jinn; of the
measure فَعِيلٌ or فَعُولٌ; [if the latter, originally
رَؤُوى;] so called because he presents himself to

-b3-  And A garment, or piece of cloth, that is spread out for
sale. (Aboo-'Alee, M, K.)

slight yellowness and dinginess (S, Mgh) which a
woman sees after washing herself in consequence
of menstruation: what is in the days of menstruation is termed حَيْضٌ [app. for دَمُ حَيْضٍ]; not تريّة:
(S:) or a little yellowness or whiteness or blood
which a woman sees on the occasion of menstruation: or, as some say, تَرَيَّةٌ signifies the piece of

CK, erroneously, تَصْوِيتٌ,]) or in which is the
like of التَّصْوِيب, like the form of the [vessel called]
إِبْرِيق: (As, T:) Nuseyr likens رُؤُوس مُرْأَيَات to
قَوَارِير [i. e. flasks, or bottles]: I know not [says

أُرْئِى seems to be its verb,] nor any art. to which
