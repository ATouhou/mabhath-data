رُعْظٌ The socket of the head of an arrow, or
place into which the head enters, over which are
the twists of sinew: pl. أَرْعَاظٌ. (Lth, S, K.) It is
said in a prov., إِنَّ فُلَانًا لَيَكْسِرُ عَلَيْكَ أَرْعَاظَ النَّبْلِ
[Verily such a one breaks against thee the sockets
of the heads of the arrows]: applied to him whose
anger is vehement: as though one said, when he
takes the arrow, (K, TA,) being vehemently
angry, (TA,) he strikes the ground with its
point, in his silent wrath, with such vehemence
as to break the socket of its head: or it means
(tropical:)  he grates the teeth at thee, (K, TA,) by reason
of the vehemence of his anger, so that their sockets
break; (TA;) the sockets of the dog-teeth being
thus likened to the sockets of arrow-heads: (K,
TA:) so in the O and L. (TA.) And it is said
in another prov., مَا قَدَرْتُ عَلَى كَذَا حَتَّى تَعَطَّفَتْ
عَلَىَّ أَرْعَاظُ النَّبْلِ [I was not able to do such a
thing until the sockets of the heads of the arrows
became much bent against me]. (O, K.)
رَعِظٌ An arrow having its رُعْظ broken: (S:)
and [in like manner,] ↓ مَرعُوظٌ an arrow having
its رُعْظ broken, and being therefore bound with
sinew: (IB:) or the latter signifies a weak arrow.
(Aboo-Kheyreh El-'Adawee, Ibn-' Abbád.)
رَعِيظٌ and ↓ مَرْعُوظٌ An arrow [having a رُعْظ
made to it: (see 1:) or] having the sinew wound
and bound upon it. (TA.)
