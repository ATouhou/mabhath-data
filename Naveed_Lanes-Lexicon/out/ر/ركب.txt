أَنْفَهُ بِرُكْبَتِى I struck his nose with my knee.
(TA.) And in another trad., أَمَا تَعْرِفُ الأَزْدَ وَرَكْبَهَا
اِتَّقِ الأَزْدَ لَا يَأْخُذُوكَ فَيَرْكُبُوكَ [Knowest thou not
El-Azd, (the tribe so called,) and their striking
with the knee? Beware thou of El-Azd, lest they
take thee, and strike thee with their knees]: for
this practice was notorious among El-Azd; in the
dial. of whom, أُمُّ كَيْسَانَ was a metonymical appellation of the knee. (TA.)

it, in another thing: he composed it; constituted

putting together, or combining, things, whether
suitable or not, or placed in order or not: it is a
more general term than تَأْلِيفٌ, which is the collecting together, or putting together, suitable

رَكْبٌ: see رَاكِبٌ, in three places.
رَكَبٌ The عَانَة: (ISk, Msb, K:) or the place
of growth of the عَانَة, (S, K,) or of the hair of
the عَانَة: (Mgh:) [i. e. it signifies the pubes;
either as meaning the hair of the mons Veneris,
or the mons Veneris itself: generally the latter;
and this is often meant by the term عانة alone:]
or the part that slopes down from the belly, and is
beneath the ثُنَّة [q. v.] and above the pudendum:
in all these senses said by Lh to be masc.: (TA:)
or the pudendum (Az, Msb, K) itself: (TA:) or
the external portion thereof: (K:) or the رَكَبَانِ
are the roots of the two thighs, upon which is the
flesh of the pudendum, (K, TA,) or upon which
are the two portions of flesh of the pudendum:
(TA:) the ركب is masc.: (Msb:) it is common
to the man and the woman, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *)
accord. to Fr: (S, Msb:) or peculiar to the
woman, (S, Mgh, K,) accord. to Kh: (S:) ElFarezdak makes it plainly common to both,
saying,
حِينَ التَقَى الرَّكَبُ المَحْلُوقُ بِالرَّكَبِ
[When the shaven pubes met the pubes]: (TA:
[and a similar ex. is given in the S and Msb,
as cited by Fr:]) the pl. is أَرْكَابٌ (S, Mgh, Msb,
K) and أَرَاكِيبُ; (K;) the latter being pl. of the
former; but in some copies of the K أَرَاكِبُ, like
مَسَاجِدُ. (TA.)
-A2-  Also Whiteness in the رُكْبَة
[or knee]. (TA.)
رَكْبَةٌ A single ride, or act of riding: pl.
رَكَبَاتٌ. (IAth, L.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, هُوَ
يَمْشِى الرَّكْبَةَ (tropical:)  [i. e. يَرْكَبُ رَأْسَهُ He goes at
random, heedlessly, or in a headlong manner, &c.,
(see 1,)] and هُمْ يَمْشُونَ الرَّكَبَاتِ (tropical:)  [They go at
random, &c.]. (A. [The meaning is there indicated by the context, and is shown by what here
follows.]) Respecting the phrase تمْشُونَ الرَّكَبَاتِ,
occurring in a trad., meaning تَرْكَبُونَ رُؤُوسَكُمْ
(assumed tropical:)  [Ye go at random, &c.], in that which is false,
wrong, or vain, and in factions, or seditions, or
the like, following one another without consideration, IAth says that رَكْبَةٌ [properly] signifies as
explained above in the first sentence of this paragraph, and that the pl. الركبات is here governed
in the accus. case by a verb understood, and [with
that verb] is a denotative of state relating to the
agent in تمشون: it supplies the place of that
verb, which it does not require to be expressed;
and the implied meaning is تَمْشُونَ تَرْكَبُونَ
الرَّكَبَاتِ. (L.)
رُكْبَةٌ a word of well-known meaning, (S, Msb,)
[The knee; i. e., in a man,] the joint between the
lower parts of the thigh and the upper parts of
the shank: (A, K:) or [in a quadruped,] the
joint between the metacarpus and the radius
(مَوْصِلُ الوَظِيفِ وَالذِّرَاعِ): this is the right explanation: in the K, مَوْضِع is erroneously put for
مَوْصِل: [this explanation is evidently given accord.
to the terms employed in the anatomy of quadrupeds as compared to human beings: in that
which next follows, there is certainly an omission,
which I have endeavoured to supply:] or the
رُكْبَتَانِ of the fore legs of the camel are the two
joints that [project forwards, in like manner as
do, in the hind legs, those that] are next the belly
[meaning the stifle-joints] when he lies down upon
his breast with folded legs: the two joints that
project behind [in the hind legs, namely, the
hocks,] are called the عُرْقُوبَانِ: in every quadruped, the ركبتان are in the fore legs, and the
عرقوبان are in the hind legs: and the عرقوب is
what is called مَوْصِلُ الوَظِيفِ [i. e. the upper joint
of the metatarsus]: (TA:) or the ركبة is the
مِرْفَق [which in a man is the elbow, but here
seems to mean the lower joint] of the ذِرَاع [or
radius] of anything [i. e. of any beast]: (K:)
[from its being said in the S and Msb that the
رُكْبَة is “ well known,” I conclude that there is
no real discrepancy in the foregoing explanations:
it is perhaps needless to add that the term رُكْبَة
is now universally applied to the knee of a man
and to what we commonly call the knee of a horse
and the like:] the pl. is رُكَبٌ, (S, Msb, K,) i. e.
the pl. of mult., and the pl. of pauc. is رُكْبَاتٌ
and رُكَبَاتٌ and رُكُبَاتٌ. (S.) Lh mentions the
phrase بَعِيرٌ مُسْتَوْقِحُ الرُّكَبِ [meaning A hardkneed camel]; as though the term رُكْبَةٌ were applied to each part, and the pl. used accord. to this
application. (TA.) ―
-b2-  One says [of an agitating
affair or event], أَمْرٌ اصْطَكَّتْ فِيهِ الرُّكَبُ وَحَكَّتْ
فِيهِ الرُّكْبَةُ الرُّكَبَةَ (tropical:)  [An affair, or event, in which the
knees knocked together, and in which the knee rubbed
the knee]. (A.) ―
-b3-  And of one who has the mark
of prostration in prayer on his forehead, between
his eyes, (L,) بَيْنَ عَيْنَيْهِ مِثْلُ رُكْبَةِ العَنْزِ [Between
his eyes is the like of the knee of the she-goat].
(A, * L.) And of any two things that are alike, or
correspondent, هُمَا كَرُكْبَتَى العَنْزِ [They are like
the two knees of the she-goat]; because her two
knees fall together upon the ground when she
lies down. (L.) ―
-b4-  And it is said in a prov., شَرُّ
النَّاسِ مَنْ مِلْحُهُ عَلَى رُكعبَتِهِ [The worst of men is
he whose fat is upon his knee]: applied to him
who is quickly angered; and to the perfidious:
(Meyd, TA:) the phrase مِلْحُهُ عَلَى رُكْبَتِهِ is also
used as meaning The smallest thing makes him
angry: (TA:) and a poet says,
لَا تَلُمْهَا إِنَّهَا مِنْ عُصْبَةٍ
مِلْحُهَا مَوْضُوعَةٌ فَوْقَ الرُّكَبْ
[Blame her not; for she is of a set of people
whose fat is placed above the knees: perhaps meaning, for she is but a woman; as women are generally fat in the part above the knee]: (TA:) or
مِنْ نِسْوَةٍ [in the place of مِنْ عُصْبَةٍ], meaning of
women whose object of anxiety, or care, is fatness
and fat: (Meyd, TA:) so that the prov. seems to
mean that the worst of men is he who has not
such intelligence as bids him to do that which is
praiseworthy, but only bids him to do that in
which is inconstancy and levity, and an inclining
to the dispositions of women, to the love of fatness
and fat. (Meyd.) [See other explanations in art.
ملح.]
-A2-  Also The lower part (أَصْل) of the plant
صِلِّيَانَة, when it has been cut. (K.)
رِكْبَةٌ A mode, or manner, of riding. (S.) You
say, هُوَ حَسَنُ الرِّكْبَةِ He has a good mode, or
manner, of riding. (A, * TA.) ―
-b2-  [It is said in
the K to be a subst. from رَكِبَهُ; as though signifying A riding.]
رَكَبَةٌ A company of riders upon camels, (K,)
or of owners of camels on a journey, or travellers
upon camels, exclusively of other beasts, (S,) but
less in number than the company called رَكْبٌ:
(S, K:) [and probably also a company of riders
upon any beasts, but less than what is called
رَكْبٌ:] accord. to MF, it is a pl. of رَاكِبٌ.
(TA.) [See also أُرْكُوبٌ.]
رَكْبَى and رَكْبَاةٌ: see رَكُوبٌ.
رَكَبُوتٌ and رَكَبُوتَى: see رَكُوبٌ.

camels (S, K, TA) upon which people journey;
(S, TA;) i. q. مَطِىٌّ: (Msb:) or camels fit for
carrying: (Har p. 22:) it has no proper sing.:
(S:) the word used for the sing. is رَاحِلَةٌ: (S,
Msb, K:) or, as ISh says, in the “ Book of
Camels,” رِكَابٌ and عِيرٌ are applied to camels
that go forth for corn (طَعَام) to be brought back
upon them, both when they go forth and after
they have come back: and the former term is applied also to camels upon which people journey to
Mekkeh, on which مَحَامِل are borne: and hired
[or other] camels that carry the goods and corn
of merchants: but camels are not called عير,
though bearing corn, [unless] if hired: [I insert
the words “ or other ” and “ unless ” because it
is further said,] عير are not those that bring corn
for their owners; but these are called رِكَابٌ:
(L, TA:) the pl. is رُكُبٌ, (S, K,) accord. to
A'Obeyd, (TA,) and رِكَابَاتٌ and رَكَائِبُ; (K;)
or, accord. to IAar, رُكُبٌ is not pl. of رِكَابٌ;
and others say that it is pl. of ↓ رَكُوبٌ, signifying
any beast on which one rides, [an epithet] of the
measure فَعُولٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ;
(TA;) but called by ISd a subst.; (TA voce
جَزُوزٌ;) and ↓ رَكُوبَةٌ is a more special term than
رَكُوبٌ. (TA in the present art.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
رِكَابُ السَّحَابِ (tropical:)  [The bearers of the clouds; i. e.]
the winds. (A, K.) Umeiyeh says,
تَرَدَّدُ وَالرِّيَاحُ لَهَا رِكَابُ

being for تَتَرَدَّدُ), the winds being its bearers].
(TA.)
-A2-  Also [The stirrup of a horse's saddle;]
a well-known appertenance of a horse's saddle;
(S;) the same with respect to a horse's saddle as
the غَرْز with respect to a camel's: pl. رُكُبٌ. (K.)
رَكُوبٌ and ↓ رَكُوبَةٌ: see رِكَابٌ: both signify
A beast that is ridden: (S:) or a she-camel that
is ridden: (K:) or the latter has this meaning:
and is metaphorically applied to anything ridden:
(Msb:) or the former signifies any beast that is
ridden: and the latter is a name for everything
that is ridden; applied to one, and to a pl.
number: (TA:) or the former signifies ridden,
as a fem. epithet: and the latter, one specially
appointed for riding; and that is constantly kept
to work; of beasts (K, TA) of any kind: (TA:)
and the latter and ↓ رَكْبَانَةٌ and ↓ رَكْبَاةٌ and
↓ رَكَبُوتٌ (K) and ↓ رَكْبَى and ↓ رَكَبُوتَى, (K *
and TA in art. حلب, [see حَلُوبٌ in several
places,]) a she-camel that is ridden; or that is
broken, trained, or rendered submissive or manageable: (K:) or رَكُوبٌ has this last signification,
accord. to AZ: and its pl. is رُكُبٌ: (TA:) the
pl. of رَكُوبَةٌ being رَكَائِبُ: (TA voce جَزُوزٌ:)
and ↓ رَكْبَانَةٌ signifies [also] a she-camel fit
to be ridden; (S, TA;) like as حَلْبَانَةٌ signifies fit to be milked: the ا and ن are [said to be]
added in order to give intensiveness to the signification: (TA:) [and all the other epithets mentioned above seem also, accord. to some, to have
an intensive sense: see حَلُوبٌ.] You say, مَا لَهُ
رَكُوبَةٌ وَلَا حَمُولَةٌ وَلَا حَلُوبَةٌ He has not a she-camel to ride, nor one to carry burdens, nor one
to be milked. (S, TA.) ―

used as a prefixed noun, as explained below; and
is said to be the original signification: IB says
that it may signify a rider upon a camel, ass,
horse, or mule, when used as a prefixed noun; as
when you say رِاكِبُ جَمَلٍ and رَاكِبُ حِمَارٍ &c.:
(L:) accord. to ISk, you term a rider upon an
ass فَارِسٌ عَلَى حِمَارٍ, (S, TA,) and a rider upon a
mule فَارِسٌ عَلَى بَغْلٍ; (TA;) but 'Omarah says,
I do not call the owner or rider of the ass فارس,
but حَمَّارٌ; and the reason of his saying so is
manifest, for فارس is an epithet of the measure
فَاعِلٌ from الفَرَسُ “ the horse,” meaning “ an
owner, or a rider, of the horse: ” (S, TA:) the
pl. is رُكَّابٌ (S, K) and رُكْبَانٌ (S, * Mgh, Msb, K)
and رُكُوبٌ (Mgh, K) and رِكَبَةٌ, (K,) or this last
is a mistake for رَكَبَةٌ [q. v.], (MF, TA,) and
↓ رَكْبٌ, (Akh, Msb, K, TA,) as some say; (TA;)
or this last is a quasi-pl. n., (K, TA,) not a broken
pl. of رَاكِبٌ; (TA;) and signifies riders upon
camels; (K;) or owners of camels on a journey,
or travellers upon camels; (S;) consisting of ten
or more: (S, K:) and sometimes it signifies riders
upon horses: (IB, K:) or riders upon horses and
camels: (IB, L, TA:) or a company of riders
upon horses; or upon horses and camels: (TA:)
[or, accord. to Kh, riders upon any beasts: (De
Sacy's Anthol. Gram. Ar. p. 54 of the Arabic
text:)] in the Kur viii. 43, الرَّكْبُ may signify
the riders upon horses, or the riders upon camels,
or the army composed of both these: (TA:) the
pl. of رَكْبٌ is أَرْكُبٌ, (S, K,) [a pl. of pauc.,] and
رُكُوبٌ. (K.) Accord. to IB, you do not say
إِبِلٍ ↓ رَكْبُ nor رُكْبَانُ إِبِلٍ: but it is said that
رُكَّابُ إِبِلٍ and رُكَّابُ خَيْلٍ &c. are allowable.
(L.) An instance of رُكْبَان as distinguished from
فُرْسَان occurs in a verse cited as one of the exs. of
the preposition بِ. (TA.) ↓ رُكَيْبٌ [properly
signifying A small company of riders upon camels,
&c.,] occurs as meaning collectors of the poorrates: it is the dim. of ↓ رَكْبٌ; and shows that
this latter is not a pl. [properly speaking] of
رَاكِبٌ; for, were it so, the word used as its dim.
would be رُوَيْكِبُونَ. (TA.) [See also رَكَبَةٌ, and
أُرْكُوبٌ.] ―
-b2-  [Also A person on board of a ship
or boat: pl. رُكَّابٌ.] You say رُكَّابُ السَّفِينَةِ
(S, TA) The persons on board of the ship, or
boat: and رُكَّابُ المَآءِ the voyagers upon the water:
and Ibn-Ahmar has used in this sense the pl.
رُكْبَانٌ; but it is said that this is not allowable;
nor is أُرْكُوبٌ; nor رَكْبٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, and
↓ رَاكُوبٌ, (assumed tropical:)  A shoot germinating upon the trunk
of a palm-tree, not having any root in the ground:
(S:) or a shoot on the upper part of a palm-tree,
hanging down, but not reaching the ground; and
so ↓ رَاكِبَةٌ and ↓ رَاكُوبَةٌ and ↓ رَكَّابَةٌ: (K:) or,
as some say, the last of these words is not thus
applied, but means a woman “ who rides much: ”
AHn, however, says that it signifies a palm-shoot,
or the like thereof, growing forth at the top of
the trunk of a palm-tree, and, in some instances,
bearing with its mother; but when it is cut off,
it is better for the mother: and رَاكِبٌ is also
explained in the L as meaning small palm-trees
that grow forth at the lower parts of large palmtrees: (TA:) or it means a shoot of a palm-tree
not cut off from its mother: (Ham p. 66:)
accord. to As, when a palm-shoot grows from the
trunk, and does not adhere to the ground, it forms
a vile kind of palm-tree; and the Arabs call it
رَاكِبٌ and ↓ رَاكُوبٌ: the pl. of this last [and of
↓ رَاكُوبَةٌ] is رَوَاكِيبُ. (TA.) ―
-b4-  رُكْبَانُ السُّنْبُلِ
means (tropical:)  What first appear, or grow forth, from
the قُنْبُع, (A, K, TA,) i. e. the envelope of the
grain, (TA,) of the ear of wheat. (K, TA.) ―

رَاكِبٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The head [or summit] of a
mountain (جَبَل), as in [most of] the copies of
the K; in some of which is found حَبْل [or rope].
(TA.)
رَاكِبَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph. ―
-b2-
Also sing. of رَوَاكِبُ (TA) which signifies
(tropical:)  Streaks [or layers] of fat, (A, K, TA,) overlying one another, (K, TA,) in the fore part of a
camel's hump: those in the hinder part are called
رَوَادِفُ, (A, K, TA,) of which the sing. is رَادِفَةٌ.
(TA.)

four places.
أَرْكَبُ Large in the رُكْبَة [or knee]. (S, K.)

(S,) but more in number than the company called
رَكْبٌ: (S, K:) pl. أَرَاكِيبُ. (TA.) [See also
رَكَبَةٌ.]
مَرْكَبٌ an inf. n. of رَكِبَ. (A, K, TA.) ―
-b2-
And also a noun of place [properly signifying A
place of riding, &c.]. (TA.) [Hence, Anything

one is borne or carried:] one of the مَرَاكِب of
the land; and [more commonly] of the sea: (S,
K:) [i. e.] a beast [on which one rides]; (A,
TA;) and a vessel, i. e. a ship or boat: (A, Mgh,
Msb, TA:) a saddle; and any kind of vehicle
borne by a camel or other beast: (the lexicons
passim:) مَرَاكِبُ is the pl. (Mgh, Msb.) You
say, نِعْمَ المَرْكَبُ الدَّابَّةُ [Excellent, or most
excellent, is the thing upon which one rides, the
beast]. (A.) And جَآءَتْ مَرَاكِبُ اليَمَنِ The
vessels, or the ships or boats, of El-Yemen came.
(A.) ―
-b3-  [And hence المَرْكَبُ as the name of
(assumed tropical:)  The principal star (a) of Pegasus; because in
the place of the saddle.]
مُرْكِبٌ A colt that has become fit for being
ridden. (TA.) And دَابَّةٌ مُرْكِبَةٌ A beast that
has attained the age at which one may ride him

(مُرَكَّبٌ) in a thing, such as a ring-stone in the
bezel, or collet, of the signet-ring. (K, * TA.)
