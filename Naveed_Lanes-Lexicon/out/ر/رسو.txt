inf. n. رُسُوٌّ (M, Msb, K) and رَسْوٌ, (K,) It (a
thing, S, M, Msb) was, or became, stationary, at
rest, fixed, fast, firm, steady, steadfast, or stable;
(S, M, Msb, K) as also ↓ ارسى, (M, K,) inf. n.
إِرْسَآءٌ; and ↓ ترسّى. (TA.) الرسو and الرسوخ [i. e.

mountain was firmly based, or firm in its base,
upon the ground. (TA.) And ثَبِيرٌ ↓ مَا أَرْسَى (tropical:)  As
long as Thebeer [the mountain so called] remains
[firm] in its place. (TA.) [Its being said that
this is tropical is app. meant to indicate that the
verbs above are properly used only in relation to
a ship, in senses explained in what follows; which,
however, I doubt.] You say also, رَسَتْ قَدَمُهُ,
meaning His foot stood firm in war: (M:) or
رَسَتْ أَقْدَامُهُمْ فِى الحَرْبِ Their feet stood firm in

anchor; lay at anchor; or] rested, or became
stationary, upon the anchor: (T, S, K:) in [some
of] the copies of the K [and of the S], عَلَى البَحْرِ
is erroneously put for على الأَنْجَرِ [or على اللَّنْجَرِ]:
(TA:) or the meaning is, [in some instances,
the ship grounded; i. e.] the lower, or lowest, part
of the ship reached the bottom of the water, and
she consequently remained stationary. (T, M,
TA.) ―

4
ارسى, inf. n. إِرْسَآءٌ: see 1, in two places.
-A2-
ارساهُ He made it (a thing, M, Msb) to become
stationary, at rest, fixed, fast, firm, steady, steadfast, or stable. (M, Msb, K.) And ارسى السَّفِينَةَ,
[inf. n. as above and also (as is shown by what
follows) مُرْسًى, He anchored the ship;] he made
the ship to rest, or become stationary, upon the
anchor: (TA:) or the meaning is, [in some instances, he grounded the ship; i. e.] he made the
lower, or lowest, part of the ship to reach the
bottom of the water, so that she remained stationary. (M, TA.) You say also of a ship,

anchor]: (M:) and of the anchor, يُرْسِى السَّفِينَةَ
It makes fast the ship, so that it does not go on.
(T, TA.) For the words of the Kur [xi. 43],
بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ مُجْرَاهَا وَمُرْسَاهَا, (S, M, * K, *) meaning
إِجْرَاؤُهَا وَإِرْسَاؤُهَا [i. e. In the name of God be the
making it to run and the making it to rest],
(Aboo-Is-hák, TA,) from أَجْرَيْتُ and أَرْسَيْتُ, (so
in one copy of the S,) or [its being made to run
and its being made to rest,] from أُجْرِيَتْ and
أُرْسِيْتْ, (so in another copy of the S,) some say
مَجْرَاهَا وَمَرْسَاهَا, (S, K,) meaning its running and
its resting, (Aboo-Is-hák, TA,) from جَرَتْ and
رَسَتْ, (S, K,) [though] Az says that the readers
agree in pronouncing the م of مرساها with damm,
but differ as to the م of مجراها, the Koofees pro-
nouncing this with fet-h, (TA,) or the latter reading may have the same meaning as the former,
(Aboo-Is-hák, TA,) or the former reading may
mean in the time, or the place, of making it to
run, and that of making it to rest, and the latter
reading may mean in the time, or the place, of its
running, and that of its resting, for in each case
each noun may be a n. of time or a n. of place or
an inf. n.; (Bd, q. v.;) and some read مُجْرِيهَا
↓ وَمُرْسِيهَا, as epithets applied to God, (M, K,)
who maketh it to run and who maketh it to rest.
(TA.) Accord. to Zj, (M,) يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ
أَيَّانَ مُرْسَاهَا, in the Kur [vii. 186 and lxxix. 42],
means [They will ask thee respecting the ساعة,]
when will be its taking place? [or when will be the
time of its being made to take place?]; (M, K; *)
by the ساعة being meant the time in which all
created beings shall die. (M.)

turtle-shell, or tortoise-shell]: pl. رَسَوَاتٌ: it has
