رنبأَرْنَبٌ [The hare; and now applied to the rabbit
also;] a certain animal, (TA,) well known, (M,
A, K, TA,) like the عناق [?], having short fore
legs and long hind legs, that treads the ground
with the hinder parts of its [hind] legs: (TA:)
a certain very prolific animal, called in Pers.
خركوش [or خَرْگُوشْ]: it is said that it is one
year a male and another year a female, and
menstruates like women; and its fore legs are
shorter than its hind legs: when it sleeps, it keeps
its eyes open; and when it is sick, it eats green
canes (قَصَب), and its sickness ceases: (Kzw:) the
word is a gen. n., (TA,) of the fem. gender,
(Msb, TA,) accord. to El-Jáhidh; (TA;) but
(Msb) applied to the male and the female; (M,
A, K, TA;) as is also ↓ أَرْنَبَةٌ, (Msb,) which is a
dial. var.: (Mgh, Msb:) or to the female [only];
the male being called خُزَزٌ; (T, M, K, TA;)
accord. to Lth; but others allow its application
to the male: (T:) the female is also called عِكْرِشَةٌ:
and the young, خِرْنِقٌ: (TA:) the pl. is أَرَانِبُ
(T, S, M, Msb, K) and أَرَانٍ, (Lh, S, M, K,) the
latter, like ثَعَالٍ for ثَعَالِبُ, occurring in poetry,
(S, M, *) and not allowed by Sb except in poetry.
(M.) The ا in أَرْنَبٌ is augmentative, accord. to Lth:
accord. to most of the grammarians it is disjunctive,
(so in a copy of the T and in the TA,) or radical:
(so in another copy of the T:) Lth says that
no word commences with a radical ا but such as
is triliteral; as أَرْضٌ and أَرْشٌ. (T, TA.) [Hence,]
one says of the low, abject, or ignominious, and
weak, إِنَّمَا هُوَ أَرْنَبٌ [He is only a hare]; because
that animal cannot defend itself, and even the
lark will endeavour to make it its prey. (A, TA.)
See another ex. below, voce أَرْنَبَةٌ. [Hence, also,]
الأَرْنَبُ is the name of (assumed tropical:)  A certain constellation,
[Lepus,] comprising twelve stars in its figure,
having no observed stars around it, situate beneath
the feet of الجَبَّار [i. e. Orion], and facing the
west. (Kzw.) ―
-b2-  Also, (K,) or ↓ مَرْنَبٌ accord.
to the L, (TA,) or both, (M,) and ↓ يَرْنَبٌ, A
جُرَذ [or large field-rat], (M, L, K,) like the jerboa,
(M, L,) having a short tail. (M, L, K.) ―
-b3-  الأَرْنَبُ
البَحْرِىُّ, accord. to Kzw, A certain marine animal,
the head of which is like that of the أَرْنَب [or
hare], and the body like that of a fish: or, accord.
to Ibn-Seenà, a small testaceous animal, which is
of a poisonous quality when drunk [app. meaning
in water]: so that, accord. to this explanation,
the resemblance [to the ارنب commonly so called]
is in the name, not the form. (TA.)
-A2-  Also A
sort of ornament worn by women. (M, K.)
أَرْنَبَةٌ The end, or tip, [i. e. the lower portion,
or lobule,] of the nose: (T, S, A, K:) this is [also]
called أَرْنَبَةُ الأَنْفِ: (Mgh, Msb:) it is one of the
parts that touch the ground in prostration [in
prayer]: (TA:) pl. أَرَانِبُ. (T, A, TA.) You
say, جَدَعَ أَرْنَبَتَهُ [lit. He cut off the end of his
nose;] meaning (assumed tropical:)  he held him in mean estimation,
or in contempt. (A, TA.) And وَجَدْتُهُمْ مُجَدَّعِى
↓ الأَرَانِبِ أَشَدَّ فَزَعًا مِنَ الأَرَانِبِ (assumed tropical:)  [I found them to
be held in contempt, (lit. having the ends of their
noses cut off,) more fearful than hares]. (A, TA.)
