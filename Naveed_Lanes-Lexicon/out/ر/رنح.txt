رنح2
رنّحهُ, [inf. n. as below,] said of wine
(شَرَاب), It made him to incline from side to side.
(A, TA.) [Also, as appears from what follows,
It made him to incline and go round. It made
him giddy in the head, and confused: it affected
him with giddiness in the head like one in a
swoon.] It deprived him of his strength by reason
of its potency. (Ham p. 562.) [And, said of a
beating, and app. of intoxication &c., It made
him to swoon, or faint: for,] when you have
beaten a person so that he swoons, or faints, you
say, ضَرَبْتُهُ حَتَّى رَنَّحْتُهُ. (Ham ibid.) [Hence,
رُنِّحَ He was made to incline from side to side:
رَنَّحَ is expl. in the TA in a similar sense, as said
of a man &c.; but it is app. a mistranscription
for رُنِّحَ]: see 5. He was made to incline and go
