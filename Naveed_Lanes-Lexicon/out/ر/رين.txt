رين1
رَانَ, [aor. يَرِينُ,] inf. n. رَيْنٌ, [in its primary
acceptation, app. signifies It was, or became, rusty,
or covered with rust. And hence,] It (a garment,
or piece of cloth,) was, or became, dirty, or filthy;
syn. تَطَبَّعَ. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence also,] رانت
نَفْسَهُ, (S, M, K, *) aor. تَرِينُ, inf. n. as above, (S,)
His soul [or stomach] became heavy; or heaved,
or became agitated by a tendency to vomit; syn.
غَثَتْ, (S, M, K,) and خَبُثَتْ. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  And ران
عَلَيْهِ, (A'Obeyd, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. and
inf. n. as above, (Msb,) It (anything) covered it;
namely, a thing: (M:) or it (anything) overcame
him; (A'Obeyd, T, S, M, * Mgh, Msb, K;) as
also ران بِهِ; (A'Obeyd, T, S, Mgh, K;) and رَانَهُ.
(A'Obeyd, S, Mgh, K.) [And رَانَ with يَرُونُ for
its aor. signifies the same; as will be seen from a
verse cited below.] You say of a sin, misdeed, or
transgression, (ذَنْب,) ران عَلَى قَلْبِهِ, (Zj, T, S,
Mgh, K,) aor. as above, (Zj, T, S,) inf. n. رَيْنٌ
(Zj, T, S, M, K) and رُيُونٌ, (S, M, K,) It covered
his heart: (Zj, T, M:) or it overcame his heart.
(S, Mgh, K.) رَانَ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبوُنَ,
in the Kur [lxxxiii. 14], means [What they used
to do] hath become like rust upon the clearness of
their hearts, so as to make the knowledge of good
from evil to be obscured to them: (Er-Rághib,
TA:) or hath covered their hearts: (Zj, T:) or
hath overcome their hearts: [or hath spread a
blackness upon their hearts; for,] accord. to
El-Hasan, it means that sin has followed upon
sin so that the heart has become black: (S:) and
accord. to Aboo-Mo'adh the Grammarian, and a
saying of the Prophet, الرَّيْنُ means the heart's
becoming black in consequence of sins. (T.) You
say also, رِينَ عَلى قَلْبِهِ His heart became covered
[&c.]. (M.) And رِينَ بِهِ He was overcome:
(T, Mgh:) or his property was beset by debt:
(T:) or he fell into grief, by reason of debt:
(M:) or he fell into that from which he could not
escape, (AZ, T, S, Mgh, K,) and with which he
had not power to cope: (AZ, T, S:) or i. q.
اُنْقُطِعَ بِهِ [i. e. he became disabled from prosecuting his journey, his means having failed him,
or his beast breaking down with him or perishing]; (T, S, M;) so says El-Kanánee El-Aarábee:
(T, S:) and he died. (M.) And رَانَتْ بِهِ الخَمْرُ,
(T,) or رانت عَلَيْهِ الخَمْرُ, (S, M, [in one copy of
the S الحُمَّى,]) The wine overcame him; (S, M;)
and overwhelmed him: (M:) or overcame his
heart and his reason: (T:) and in like manner
one says of drowsiness, and of anxiety; by way
of comparison. (M.) And ران النُّعَاسُ فِى العَيْنِ
Drowsiness overcame the eye: (S, TA: *) or infected, or pervaded, the eye. (Msb.) Et-Tirimmáh
says,
مَخَافَةَ أَنْ يَرُونَ النَّوْمُ فِيهِمْ
بِسُكْرِ سِنَاتِهِمْ كُلَّ الرُّيُونِ
[In fear that sleep might overcome them, by reason
of the intoxication of their sensations of drowsiness, with every degree of overcoming]. (TA.
[This, together with a signification assigned to
مَرُونَ in art. رون in the K, shows that رَانَ signifying “ he, or it, overcame,” &c., has يَرُونَ as
well as يَرِينُ for its aor.]) And you say also,
ران عَلَيْهِ المَوْتُ, and ران بِهِ, Death took him
away. (M.)
4
ارانوا Their cattle perished, or died: (ElUmawee, T, S, M, K:) and (so in the T, but in
the M “ or ”) their cattle became lean, or emaciated. (El-Umawee, T, M.) This also, says
A'Obeyd, is from an event that has happened to
them and overcome them, and which they have
not been able to bear. (T.)
رَانٌ: see the next paragraph.
-A2-  Also [A kind
of legging;] a thing like a خُفّ [or boot], but
longer, and without a foot: (K:) described by
the author of the Msb, in his handwriting upon
the margin, as a piece of cloth made like the
خُفّ, stuffed with cotton, worn beneath it on
account of the cold: not a genuine Arabic word:
(MF:) it is a Persian word, arabicized. (TA.)
رَيْنٌ, originally an inf. n.: (Msb:) Rust that
overspreads the sword and the mirror; (M;)
rust that overspreads a polished thing: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or much dirtiness from rust: or
simply dirt, filth, soil, or pollution: syn. طَبَعٌ
and ذَنَسٌ: (S, K: [in a copy of the S, and in the
CK, الطَّبْعُ is erroneously put for الطَّبَعُ:]) or a
cover, or covering. (Msb.) [And hence,] The
like of rust, covering the heart: (Zj, T:) black-
ness of the heart: pl. رِيَانٌ. (T.) And ↓ رَانٌ
signifies the same as رَيْنٌ. (TA.)
رَيْنَةٌ i. q. خَمْرَةٌ [i. e. Wine, or some wine, or a
kind of wine]: pl. رَيْنَاتٌ: (IAar, Th, T, K:) so
called because it overcomes the reason. (TA.)
رَجُلٌ مَرِينٌ عَلَيْهِ A man beset, or encompassed.
(TA.)
مُرِينُونَ Persons whose cattle have perished, or
died: (El-Umawee, T, S, K:) and whose cattle
have become lean, or emaciated. (El-Umawee, T.)
