رزأ1
رَزَأَهُ, aor.
رَزَاَ, inf. n. رُزْءٌ and مَرْزِئَةٌ, He got, or
obtained, from him good (S, K) of any kind.
(S.) And رَزَأَ فُلَانٌ فُلَانًا i. q. برّه; [a mistake,
through an oversight, for قَبِلَ بِرَّهُ; i. e. Such a
one accepted the bounty of such a one;] as also
رَزَاهُ, without ء: the former said by AM to be the
original. (TA.) And رَزَأَ الشَّىْءَ He took from
the thing, diminished it, lessened it, or impaired
it; (K;) and ↓ ترازأهُ signifies the same; or he
took from it, diminished it, &c., by little and
little. (JM.) You say, رَزَأَهُ مَالَهُ, and رَزِئَهُ مَالَهُ,
aor.
رَزَاَ, inf. n. رُزْءٌ, He got, or obtained, somewhat
of his property; as also مَالَهُ ↓ ارتزأهُ. (K.) And
مَا رَزَأْتُهُ مَالَهُ, (S,) and مَا رَزِئْتُهُ مَالَهُ, (S, K, *) I
did not take from him of his property; or did
not diminish to him his property. (S, K. *) And
مَا رَزِئْتُهُ شَيْئًا I did not take from him, or it,
aught. (Mgh.) And مَا رَزَأَ فُلَانًا شَيْئًا He did not
get, or obtain, from such a one aught of his
property; and did not take from him aught
thereof. (TA.) And مَا رَزَأْتُهُ زِبَالًا I did not take
from him, or it, as much as an ant would carry
with its mouth: (Har p. 197:) or thus originally,
but meaning, anything. (S in art. زبل.) And
مَا رَزَأْنَا مِنْ مَائِكَ شَيْئًا We took not of, or from,
thy water, anything: occurring in a trad. (TA.)
In another trad., as some relate it, رَزِينَا occurs
for رَزِئْنَا, which is the original. (IAth.) Accord.
to AZ, [however,] one says, رُزِئْتُهُ, meaning [I
had it taken, or received, from me; or, virtually,]
it was taken, or received, from me; but not رُزِيتُهُ.
(TA.) [Hence, when relating to a moral attribute, or the like, it virtually means (assumed tropical:)  It was
experienced from me: see a verse cited voce
مُتْلَدٌ, in art. تلد.] You say also, هُوَ يُرْزَأُ, [virtually] meaning He is a bountiful person; one
whose gratuitous gifts people obtain. (Ham
p. 722.) And إِنَّهُ لَقَليِلُ الرُّزْءِ مِنَ الطَّعَامِ Verily he is
one who gets little of the food. (TA.) ―
-b2-  رَزَأْتُهُ
also signifies I afflicted him with an affliction, a
misfortune, or a calamity. (Msb.) And رَزَأَتْهُ
رَزِيْئَةٌ An affliction, a misfortune, or a calamity,
befell him. (S, Msb.) It is said in a trad., respecting a woman who came asking for her son,
إِنْ أُرْزَأِ ابْنِى فَلَمْ أُرْزَأْ أَحْبَابِى, meaning If I be
afflicted by the loss of my son, I have not been
afflicted by the loss of my friends. (TA.)

-A2-  ارتزأ also signifies It (a thing, S)
was, or became, diminished, lessened, or impaired.
(S, K.) A poet says, (namely, Ibn Mukbil, describing a stallion, S in art. زبل,)
فَلَمْ يَرْتَزِىءْ بِرُكُوبٍ زِبَالَا
(S, TA) And he had not been lessened [by riding,
so as to lose] as much as the gnat will carry:
(TA:) or as much as the ant will carry with its
mouth; meaning, anything: (S in art. زبل:) but
some read ترتزىء; [and some, يُرْتَزَأْ, as in copies
of the S in art. زبل;] and some, بِرُكُونٍ. (TA.)
رُزْءٌ, (S, Mgh, K,) [originally an inf. n., and]
a subst. from رَزَأَتْهُ رَزِيْئَةٌ, (Msb,) and ↓ رَزِيْئَةٌ, (S,
Mgh, Msb, K,) also pronounced رَزِيَّةٌ, originally
with ء, (Msb,) and ↓ مَرْزِئَةٌ, (S, K,) An affliction,
a misfortune, or a calamity, (S, Msb, K, TA,)
by the loss of things dear to one: (TA:) or a
great affliction or calamity or misfortune: (Mgh:)

the second, S, Msb, TA) رَزَايَا. (S, Msb, K, TA.)

مَرْزِئَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
مُرَزَّإٌ; (so in some copies of the S; in others
مُرْزَأٌ, which is said in the K to be a mistranscription;) pl. مُرَزَّؤُونَ: (K:) A generous man, (S,
K, * [in the latter of which only the pl. is explained,] and TA,) whose good things men get, or
obtain, (S,) or from whom much is gotten, or
obtained. (TA.) One says, in praising, فُلَانٌ
مُرَزَّأٌ فِى مَالِهِ [Such a one is a person from whom
much of his property has been obtained]: and in
expressing pity and grief, فُلَانٌ مُرَزَّأٌ فِى أَهْلِهِ
[Such a one is a person who has had some one,
or more, of his family taken from him]. (Ham
p. 176.) And the pl., mentioned above, also signifies Persons of whom the best have died: (K:)
or persons of whom death befalls the best. (L.)
