manner ↓ ارجز, he composed verses of that metre.
(Ibn-Buzurj, L in art. قصد.) You say also,
رَجَزَبِهِ He recited to him (أَنْشَدَهُ [so in more than
one MS. copy of the K, and in the TA, but in the
CK أَنْشَدَ, without the affixed pronoun, which is
probably wrong,]) a poem of that metre; as also
↓ رجّزهُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. تَرْجِيزٌ. (TA.) And ↓ ترجّز
He urged, or excited, his camels by singing رَجَز,
or his رَجَز: so accord. to different copies of the

sound, or murmuring, with its waves]; as also

―
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) Punishment (Aboo-Is-hák, S,
Mgh, Msb, K) [like رِجْسٌ] that agitates by its
vehemence, and occasions vehement consecutive
commotions; (Aboo-Is-hák, Mgh, * TA;) as also
↓ رُجْزٌ: (K:) so in the Kur vii. 131; (Aboo-Is-hák;) and in ii. 56, and vii. 162, and xxix. 33.
(S.) ―
-b3-  Conduct that leads to punishment: so,
accord. to some, in the Kur lxxiv. 5; (TA;)
where some read الرِّجْزَ and others ↓ الرُّجْزَ: (S,
TA:) ↓ the latter is also expl. as signifying sin:
(TA:) and both, uncleanness; or filth: (S, K:)
so in that instance: like رِجْسٌ: (S:) and polytheism; or the associating of another, or others,
with the true God: (K, TA:) so, accord to some,
in that instance: because he who worships what
is not God is in doubt respecting his case, and
unsettled in his belief: (TA:) and the worship
of idols: (K:) so, accord. to some, in the same
instance: (TA:) or the meaning there is and idol:
(Mujáhid, S:) or ↓ the latter word signifies a
certain idol; being the name thereof: (Katádeh,
TA:) and the devil: and his suggestions. (TA.)
―
-b4-  Also Plague, or pestilence; syn. طَاعُونٌ.
(Mgh.)
رَجَزٌ A certain disease which attacks camels, in
the rump; (S, K;) so that when a she-camel
rises, or is roused, her thighs tremble for a while,
and then stretch out: (S:) or it is when there is
a convulsive motion in the hind leg or the thighs
of a camel, when he desires to stand up, or rises,
or is roused, for a while, and then a stretching
out of the same. (TA.)
-A2-  Hence, (S,) الرَّجَزُ is
the name of A certain species [or kind] of verse
or poetry; (S, A, K;) a species [or kind] of the
metres of verse; (Msb;) consisting of the measure
مُسْتَفْعِلُنْ [primarily] six times: (K:) a metre
easy to the ear and impressive to the mind;
wherefore it may be reduced to a single hemistich, and also to two feet instead of six: (TA:)
so called because it commences with a motion
and a quiescence, [i. e., a movent and a quiescent
letter,] followed by a motion and a quiescence;
and so in the other feet; resembling the رَجَز in a
she-camel, which consists in her quivering and
then being quiet: (TA:) or because of the contractedness of its feet, and the fewness of its
letters: (S, K:) or because it is [characterized
by] صُدُور without أَعْجَاز [lit. breasts without
rumps; for, as the two hemistichs generally rhyme
with each other, the verse seems as though it had
no عَجُز; i. e., as though its last foot should rather
be called عَرُوضٌ, like the last of the first hemistich, than عَجُزٌ:] (TA:) Akh once said, رَجَزٌ,
with the Arabs, is whatever consists of three feet;
and it is that [kind of verse] which they sing in
their work, and in driving their camels: [see
بِذْلَةٌ, last sentence:] ISd says that certain of
those in whom he placed confidence related this
on the authority of Kh. (TA.) Some say that it
is not verse, or poetry, but a kind of rhyming
prose; but Kh held it to be true verse, or poetry:
so in the M: but in the T it is said [as in the K]
that Kh asserted it to be not poetry, but halves
or thirds of verses: one of his reasons for this
assertion [the only one that seems to have had
much weight with the Muslims] is, that Mo-
hammad once said,
أَنَا ابْنُ عَبْدِ المُطَّلِبْ  أَنَا النَّبِىُّ لَا كَذِبْ
[which is an instance of a species of رَجَز, meaning, “I am the Prophet: it is no lie: I am the
son of 'Abd-el-Muttalib ”]: and were this verse,
he would not have said it, as is shown by what is
said in the Kur., xxxvi. 69: but on this point,
Akh has contended against him. (TA.)
رِجَازَةٌ A certain vehicle for women, (S, * TA,)
a thing smaller than the هَوْدَج: (S, K, TA:) pl.
رَجَائِزُ: (TA:) or a [garment of the kind called]
كِسَآء, (S, K, TA,) in which is a stone, (K, TA,
[in the CK a while stone,]) or in which are put
stones, (S,) and which is suspended to one of the
two sides of the هودج, to balance it, when it
inclines: (S, TA:) so called because of its commotion: (TA:) or a thing consisting of a
pillow and skins, or hides, put in one of its two
sides for that purpose, and called رِجَازَةُ المَيْلِ:
(T, TA:) or hair, (K,) or red hair, (TA,) or
wool, suspended to the هورج, (K, TA,) for ornament: pl. رَجَائِزُ, said to occur in a verse of EshShemmákh: but accord. to As, this is a mistake
for جَزَائِزُ [pl. of جَزِيزَةٌ, q. v.]. (TA.)
رَجَّازٌ and رَجَّازَةٌ: see رَاجِزٌ; the latter, in two
places.
رَاجِزٌ One who utters, or recites, poetry, or verse,
of the metre termed رَجَزٌ; who speaks in verse of
that metre; who poetizes, or versifies, in that
metre: and in like manner, ↓ مُرْتَجِزٌ, and ↓ رَجَّازٌ
[which signifies one who does so much], and
↓ رَجَّازَةٌ [one who does so very much]. (TA.)
El-'Ajjáj has been placed the highest in rank as
a راجز. (Mz, 49th نوع.) [His son, Ru-beh, seems
to occupy nearly an equal place. Each of them
composed a complete deewán of رَجَز.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
↓ سَحَابَةٌ رَجَّازَةٌ (tropical:)  [A cloud thundering much, or
uninterruptedly]. (A, TA.) And ↓ غَيْثٌ مُرْتَجِزٌ,
and ↓ مُتَرَجِّزٌ, (tropical:)  Rain accompanied by thunder.
(TA.)
أَرْجَزُ A camel having the disease termed رَجَزٌ:
fem. رَجْزَآءُ: (S, K:) the latter is explained as
signifying weak in the rump, that does not move
from her place unless after twice or thrice rising
from the place where she lay: and that does not
rise, when she desires to do so, unless after vehement trembling. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] إِنَّهَا لَرَجْزَآءُ,
said of the wind (الرِّيح), (assumed tropical:)  Verily it is continuous,
or lasting. (TA.) And رَجْزَآءُ القِيَامِ (tropical:)  A great,
heavy cooking-pot. (TA.)
أُرْجُوزَةٌ A poem of the metre termed رَجَزٌ: (Msb,
K:) pl. أَرَاجِيزُ. (A, K.)
مُرْتَجِزٌ: see رَاجِزٌ; the former, in two places.
مُتَرَجِّزٌ: see رَاجِزٌ; the former, in two places.
