[See also ثِلْثٌ, and عُرَيْجَآءُ.] Lebeed uses it metaphorically in relation to palm-trees growing over
water, saying,
يَشْرَبْنَ رِفْهًا عِرَاكًا غَيْرَ صَادِيَةٍ
فَكُلُّهَا كَارِعٌ فِى المَآءِ مُغْتَمِرُ

رُفَهٌ i. q. تِبْنٌ [i. e. Straw; or straw that has
been trodden, or thrashed, and cut: by some
written رُفَّةٌ; and by some, رُفَتٌ]: (Kr, S, K:)
whence the prov., أَغْنَى مِنَ التُّفَهِ عَنِ الرُّفَهِ [More
free from want than the badger is from the want
of straw]; التُّفَهُ meaning the beast of prey called
عَنَاقُ الأَرْضِ; because it does not feed upon straw:
(S:) [by some written التُّفَّهُ; and by some, التُّفَةُ;
and by some, التُّفَّةُ:] accord. to some, the former
word is with ة; and الرُّفَرُفَتٌ occurs as its pl. in a
verse cited by IF: accord to ISk, the two words
are correctly without teshdeed, and with the
radical ه. (TA in art. تفه.) [See also رُفَتٌ, in
art. رفت.]
رَفْهَةٌ Pity, compassion, or mercy. (AHeyth,
K.) Thus expl. as used in the saying, إِذَا سَقَطَتِ
الطَّرْفَهْ قَلَّتْ فِى الأَرْضِ الرَّفْهَه. (TA. [But الطَّرْفَه
is here an evident mistranscription for الصَّرْفَه, the
name of the Twelfth Mansion of the Moon: the
meaning is, When الصرفه sets aurorally, pity becomes little in the earth; because then the cold
ends: see art. صرف.])

in the S and K,]) A state of life ample in its
means or circumstances, unstraitened, or plentiful,
(S, Msb, K,) and easy, pleasant, soft, or delicate:
