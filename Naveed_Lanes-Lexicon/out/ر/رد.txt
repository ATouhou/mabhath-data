رَدَّهُ, (S, M, Msb, K, &c.,) aor.
رَدَ3َ, (S, M, L,)
inf. n. رَدٌّ (S, M, Msb, K, &c.) and مَرَدٌّ (S, M,
L, K) and مَرْدُودٌ, (S, L, K,) this last an inf. n.
like مَحْلُوفٌ and مَعْقُولٌ, (S, L,) and رِدَّةٌ (S [there
said to be an inf. n., like رَدٌّ of رَدَّهُ, aor.
رَدُ3َ,]) and
رِدِّيدَى, (S, L, K, [but in the S and L merely said
to be syn. with رَدٌّ,]) an intensive form, (Mgh,
TA,) and تَرْدَادٌ, which is [also] an intensive or a
frequentative inf. n. of رَدَّهُ, (Sb, M, L,) and likewise an inf. n. of ردّدهُ; (Sb, S, M, L;) and
↓ ارتدّهُ; (M, L;) He made, or caused, him, or
it, to return, go back, come back, or revert; sent,
turned, or put, him, or it, back, or away; returned, rejected, repelled, or averted, him, or it;
syn. رَجَعَهُ, (S, M, L, Msb,) and صَرَفَهُ, (S, M, L,
K) and دَفَعَهُ; (Msb in art. دفع, &c.;) عَنْ وَجْهِهِ
[from his, or its, course]. (S, M.) Hence, in the
Kur [xxx. 42 and xlii. 46], يَوْمٌ لَا مَرَدَّ لَهُ [A day
which there shall be no repelling, or averting],
meaning the day of resurrection. (Th, M, L.)
One says, أَمْرُ اللّٰهِ لَا مَرَدَّ لَهُ The command of God,
there is no repelling, or averting it. (L.) And
لَيْسَ لِأَمْرِ اللّٰهِ مَرْدُودٌ i. e. رَدٌّ [There is no repelling,
or averting, the command of God.] (A.) And
رَدَّهُ عَنِ الأَمْرِ He made him to return or revert,
or turned him back or away, with gentleness,
from the thing, or affair; as also لَدَّهُ. (T, L.)
―
-b2-  Accord. to some, رَدَّ is made doubly trans.
with إِلَى to the second objective complement when
honour is intended to be shown, and with عَلَى
when dishonour is intended; and they adduce as
evidence of the correctness of their assertion the
sayings in the Kur [xxviii. 12] فَرَدَدْنَاهُ إِلَى أُمِّهِ
[So we returned, or restored, him to his mother]
and [iii. 142] يَرُدُّوكُمْ عَلَى أَعْقَابِكُمْ [They will turn
you back, or cause you to return, to your former
condition]: but instances may be found at variance
with this assertion. (MF.) [Such instances are
of frequent occurrence; though in others, the distinction pointed out above is observed, as may be
seen in what here follows.] You say, رَدَّهُ إِلَى مَنْزِلِهِ
He sent him back to his abode. (S, L, Msb.) And
رَدَّ إِلَيْهِ جَوَابًا He returned, or rendered, to him a
reply, or an answer; (S, A, * L, Msb;) he sent
to him a reply, or an answer. (Msb.) And
رَدَّ عَلَيْهِ He replied to him, or answered him, in
an absolute sense; (L;) and also, by way of
refutation or objection, i. e. he replied against
him; فَقَالَ and said, or بِقَوْلِهِ by his saying. (TA
&c., passim.) And رَدَّ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامَ He returned to
him the salutation. (The Trads. &c., passim.)
And رَدَّ عَلَيْهِ الوَدِيعَةَ He returned, rendered, restored, or sent [back], to him the deposite; (Msb;)
and المَنِيحَةَ [the she-camel, or sheep, or goat, lent to
him for him to milk her]. (S in art. منح.) And
رَدَّ عَلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ, (S, Mgh, L, K,) inf. n. رَدٌّ and مَرَدٌّ,
(Mgh,) He rejected the thing, (such as a gift, A,
and bad money, L,) refusing to receive it, or
accept it, from him; [as though he cast it back
at him;] and so الشَّىْءَ ↓ رَادَّهُ. (S, L, K. *) And
in like manner, He rejected the thing in reply to
him, charging him with error in respect of it.
(S, L, K.) And رَدَدْتُ عَلَيْهِ قَوْلَهُ [I rebutted, rejected, or repudiated, in reply to him, his saying,
charging him with error therein; I refused him
my assent to it]. (A, Msb.) [And رَدَدْتُ قَوْلَهُ
I rebutted, rejected, or repudiated, in reply, or
replication, his saying, as wrong, or erroneous;
refuted it, or refelled it; refused assent to it;
controverted it, or contradicted it. And رَدَّ الأَمْرَ
He refused assent, or consent, to the thing, or
affair. And رَدَّ عَلَيْهِ الأَمْرَ He refused him his
assent, or consent, to the thing, or affair.] And
رَدَّ السَّائِلَ He turned back, or away, the beggar,
or asker, from the object of his want: (A:) [he
rebuffed him:] or he sent away, or dismissed, the
beggar, or asker, either with refusal or with a
gift: occurring in trads. with both of these meanings. (L.) ―
-b3-  رَدَّ البَابَ He shut, or closed, the
door. (Mgh. [See مَرْدُودٌ.]) ―
-b4-  [رَدَّ يَدَهُ إِلَى سَيْفِهِ
is a phrase of frequent occurrence, meaning He
put back his hand to his sword; it being hung
behind him: (see 4 in art. خلف:) and hence,
simply, he put his hand to his sword.] فَرَدُّوا
أَيْدِيَهُمْ فِى أَفْوَاهِهِمْ, in the Kur xiv. 10, means
And they put their hands to their mouths by
reason of vehement anger or wrath or rage.
(Jel.) ―
-b5-  رَدَّهُ فِى أَمْرٍ [He made him to enter again
into an affair, or a state]. (ISh, TA in art. نكس.)
―
-b6-  رَدَّ الشَّىْءَ He repeated the thing; did it again;
syn. أَعَادَهُ. (M in art. عود.) You say, رَدَّ عَلَيْهِمُ
الأَيْمَانَ He repeated to them the oaths. (L in
art. جلد.) [In this sense, رِدِّيدَى is one of the
inf. ns. in use; as in the following ex.] It is said
in a trad., لَا رِدِّيدَى فِى الصَّدَقَةِ [There shall be no
repeating in the case of the poor-rate]; (T, S, L;)
meaning that the poor-rate shall not be taken
twice (T, L) in one year. (L.) [See also 2, which
has a similar signification.] ―
-b7-  هٰذَا لَا يَرُدُّ عَلَيْكَ,
originally لَا يَرُدُّ عَلَيْكَ شَيْئًا (assumed tropical:)  [This will not return
anything to thee], means [this will not bring any
return to thee, or] this will not profit thee: (Har
p. 483:) and مَا يَرُدُّ عَلَيْكَ هٰذَا (tropical:)  This does not
profit thee. (A.) ―
-b8-  رَدَّ إِلَيْهِ الأَمْرَ (assumed tropical:)  [He referred
the affair, or case, to him for management or
decision: or] he committed to him the affair, or
case; syn. فَوَّضَهُ إِلَيْهِ. (S and A and K in art.
فوض.) ―
-b9-  [رَدَّ الشَّىْءَ إِلَى أَصْلِهِ, a phrase of frequent occurrence, He reduced the thing to its
original state.] And رَدَّ الرُّبْعَ خُمْسًا [He reduced
the fourth part to a fifth part]. (K in art. ربع.)
―
-b10-  رَدَّ اللّٰهُ نَفْسِى إِلَى وَقْتِ انْتِهَآءِ مُدَّتِى [God
brought my soul to the time of the end of my
duration]. (IB, TA in art. امر.) ―
-b11-  رَدَّهُ إِلَى الأَمْرِ
[He reduced him to the thing, or affair]: (M
and K in art. قصر, in explanation of قَصَرَهُ عَلَى
الأَمْرِ:) or he appropriated him [or it, restrictively,]
to the thing, or affair. (TK in that art.) ―
-b12-
رَدَّ آخِرَ الشَّىْءِ إِلَى أَوَّلِهِ, (S and K in art. عكس, &c,)
and رَدَّ أَوَّلَهُ عَلَى آخِرِهِ, (Msb in the same art., &c.,)
[He reversed the thing; made the last part of it
to be first, and the first part of it to be last;
turned it hind part before, and fore part behind.]
And رَدَّ بَعْضَ الأَمْرِ عَلَى بَعْضِ [He reversed the
order of part, or of the parts, of the affair, or
case]. (TA in art. رك.) And رَدَدْتُ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرَهُ i. q.
عَكَسْتُهُ عَلَيْهِ [I reversed to him his affair, or case;
I made his affair, or case, to become the contrary
of what it was to him]. (Msb in art. عكس.)
[Hence,] ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَا لَكُمُ الكَرَّةَ عَلَيْهِمْ, in the Kur
xvii. 6, means [Then we gave to you] the turn to
prevail against them, or the victory over them.
(Bd, Jel.) ―
-b13-  [Hence, also, رَدَّهُ sometimes signifies He, or it, rendered him, or it; or caused him,
or it, to become; (like صَيَّرَهُ;) when it has a
second objective complement the contrary in meaning to the first; as in the following ex.; and it
may have this meaning likewise when it has a
second objective complement differing in meaning
from the first in a less degree.] A poet says,
رَمَى الحَدَثَانُ نِسْوَةَ آلِ حَرْبٍ
بِأَمْرٍ قَدْ سَمَدْنَ لَهُ سُمُودَا
فَرَدَّ شُعُورَهُنَّ السُّودَ بِيضًا
وَرَدَّ وُجُوهَهُنَّ البِيضَ سُودَا
[The casualties of fortune smote the women of the
family of Harb with an event whereat they
became confounded with great confoundedness;
and it rendered their black hairs white, and
rendered their white faces black]. (L in art.
سمد.)
2
ردّدهُ, inf. n. تَرْدِيدٌ and تَرْدَادٌ, (S, L,) [the
latter of which ns. is merely said in the K to be
syn. with the former, and is said in the M and L

repelled, or averted, him, or it; much, frequently,

-b3-
Hence, (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, made him, or caused him, to

affairs: see, again, 5. And hence, (assumed tropical:)  He, or it,
confounded, or perplexed, him, so that he was
unable to see his right course: see, again, 5; and
see also مُرَدَّدٌ.] And ردّد الأَمْرَ (assumed tropical:)  [He agitated the
thing, or affair, to and fro in his mind]. (TA in
art. نج, &c.) ―
-b4-  And He repeated it; iterated it:
[or rather] he repeated it time after time; reiterated it: he reproduced it: he renewed it: syn.
أَعَادَهُ, (W p. 15,) and كَرَّرَهُ, (A, and W ibid.,)
and رَجَّعَهُ. (Mgh in art. رجع. [See also 1.])

or sentence, time after time; reiterated it to
him.] And ردّد صَوْتَهُ فِى حَلْقِهِ He reiterated his
voice in his throat, or fauces; syn. رَجَّعَهُ; (S and
K in art. رجع, &c.;) [as camels and other animals do in braying; (the Lexicons passim;)
and he quavered, or trilled, rapidly repeating
many times one very short note, or each note of a
piece;] like [as is done in] chanting, [for so the
Arabs generally do in chanting, and in singing
and piping, often throughout the whole performance,] (S in that art.,) or in reading or
reciting, or in singing, or piping, or other performances, of such as are accompanied with
quavering, or trilling. (TA in that art.)

art.,) He endeavoured to turn him [from, or to,
a thing]; syn. رَاجَعَهُ and رَاوَدَهُ. (L in art. رود.)
―
-b2-  رادّهُ الشَّىْءَ: see 1, in the former half of the
paragraph. [Hence,] رادّهُ القَوْلَ [and رادّهُ فِى
القَوْلِ (occurring in the TA in art. عت)] He
disputed with him, rebutting, or rejecting, or
repudiating, in reply to him, what he said; he

her vulva swollen in consequence of lust for the
stallion: or had her أَرْفَاغ [or groins, or inguinal
creases, or the like], or her udder, and her vulva,
swollen in consequence of drinking much water.
(M, L.) [See also مُردٌّ.] ―
-b2-  And اردّ [said of a
man, app. from the verb as explained in the first
sentence of this paragraph, His seminal fluid returned into his back, or he secreted much seminal
fluid, in consequence of his having been long
without a wife, or absent from his home: see
مُرِدٌّ: and see also 6. And hence, (assumed tropical:)  He was, or
became, very libidinous: see, again, مُرِدٌّ. And]

was made, or caused, to return, go back, come
back, or revert; &c.; or he, or it, returned, went

He repairs frequently to, or frequents, the assemblies of science; syn. يَخْتَلِفُ. (A.) See also 6.
―
-b2-  [And as the returning repeatedly involves the
going repeatedly, it signifies also, like اختلف,
He, or it, went, or moved, repeatedly, to and
fro; so went and came; or reciprocated. Thus,]
تَرَدُّدُ الشَّىْءِ المُعَلَّقِ فِى الهَوَآءِ [means The moving
to and fro of a thing suspended in the air]. (K
in art. ذب.) You say, تردّدت الرُّوحُ The soul, or

-b3-  [Hence,]
(assumed tropical:)  He wavered, or vacillated, فِى الرَّأْىِ [in opinion]: (MA:) and فِى الأَمْرِ [in the affair], (S and
K in art. لث, &c.,) and بَيْنَ أَمْرَيْنِ [between two

يُرَاجِعُ مَا قَدْ فَاتَهُ بِرَِدَادِ
