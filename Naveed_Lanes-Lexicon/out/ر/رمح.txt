its iron head mounted upon it:] pl. رِمَاحٌ and
أَرْمَاحٌ, (S, L, Msb, K,) the former of mult. and
the latter of pauc. (L.) [Hence the saying,]
كَسَرُوا بَيْنَهُمْ رُمْحًا [lit. They broke a spear between
them, or among them; meaning] (tropical:)  evil, or mischief, [or enmity, or contention,] happened between them, or among them. (A, TA.) And

-b3-  [As a measure in astronomy, accord. to modern Arabian
astronomers, it is Four degrees and a half; the
eightieth part of a great circle; and accord. to
various works on practical law, it consists of
twelve أَشْبَار (or spans): but there is reason to
believe that ancient usage differed from the
modern, with respect to both these measures, and
was not precise nor uniform: in an instance mentioned voce زُبَانَى, it appears to be about twice
the measure stated above; i. e., about nine degrees;
and to consist of five cubits, a measure perhaps
equal to twelve spans.] ―
-b4-  أَخَذَتْ رِمَاحَهَا, said of

A, TA,) and of any similar pasture, (T, TA,)
(tropical:)  It assumed, or put forth, its prickles, (A, * TA,)
or became dry in its prickles, (T, TA,) and thus
(T, A, TA) resisted the attempts of animals to
pasture upon it. (T, S, A, L, TA.) Also, said of
camels, (tropical:)  They became fat, (S, K, TA,) or yielded
milk plentifully; (S, TA;) as though they prevented one's slaughtering them; (K;) or because
their owner is prevented from slaughtering them:
(S:) or they became goodly in the eye of their
owner so that he was prevented from slaughtering
them; (A, * TA;) and so أَخَذَتْ أَسْلِحَتَهَا. (TA.)
One says also نَاقَةٌ ذَاتُ رُمْحٍ (tropical:)  A fat she-camel;
and إِبِلٌ ذَوَاتُ رِمَاحٍ (tropical:)  fat camels; because their
owner, when desiring to slaughter them, looks at
their fatness and their goodly appearance, and is

(A, K.) [See the following verses.] ―
-b6-  رِمَاحُ
العَقْرَبِ i. q. شَوْلَاهَا [evidently a mistranscription for
شَوْلَاتُهَا, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The stings of scorpions, with which
they strike; العقرب being here used, as it seems
to be in some other instances, as a coll. gen. n.:
that such is the case is shown by the verses here
following, quoted in the TA as an ex. of رِمَاحُ
الجِنِّ]. (K.) A poet, cited by Th, says,
لَعَمْرُكَ مَا خَشِيتُ عَلَى أُبَىٍّ
رِمَاحَ بَنِى مُقَيِّدَةِ الحِمَارِ
وَلٰكِنِّى خَشِيتُ عَلَى أُبَىٍّ
رِمَاحَ الجِنِّ أَوْ إِيَّاكَ حَارِ
[By thy life, or by thy religion, I feared not, for
Ubeí, the stings of the scorpions; but I feared,
for Ubeí, the pestilence, or thee, O Harith; حَارِ
being for حَارِثُ]; by بنى مقيّدة الحمار he means
the scorpions. (TA.) ―
-b7-  [The dim.] ↓ رُمَيْحٌ is a
proper name of (assumed tropical:)  The penis; (K, * TA;) like as

-b8-  ↓ ذُو الرُّمَيْحِ means (assumed tropical:)  A species
of jerboa, (K, TA,) long in the hind legs, in the
middle [?] of each وَظِيف [here meaning metacarpus] having a nail in excess [of those of the
hind feet; for the fore feet have each five toes of
which one only has no nail, and the hind feet have
each but three toes, all of which have nails]: or
it means any jerboa: and its رمح [evidently a
mistranscription for رُمَيْح] is its tail. (TA. [It
is there added, ورماحه شولاتها; another mistranscription, and an obvious solecism; or probably
some words which should have preceded these
have been omitted by the copyist.])

-b2-  and see also the paragraph
here following.
رِمَاحٌ a pl. of رُمْحٌ. (S &c.)

of kicking, or striking with the hind leg or with
both the hind legs;] a subst. from رَمَحَ said of any

وَالرَّمَاحِ [I am irresponsible to thee for the vice of

in like manner, signifies A trick of kicking: see
an ex. voce جَمْحَةٌ.]

قَوْسٌ رَمَّاحَةٌ A bow that propels [the arrow] vehemently. (K.) The word رمّاحة used [app. in this
sense, without a subst.,] by Tufeyl El-Ghanawee
is expl. by some as meaning A thrust, or piercing,
with the رُمْح; but no way of resolving this is
known, unless it be used in the place of ↓ رَمْحَةٌ,
as the inf. n. of un. of رَمَحَ. (L.)

and simply الرُّمْحُ], (S, K,) whence its name:
it is one of two stars which are together called
السِّمَاكَانِ; and is not one of the Mansions of the
Moon: (S:) it is also called السِّمَاكُ المِرْزَمُ:
(Az, TA:) the other سماك [is Spica Virginis,
the Fourteenth Mansion of the Moon, and] is
called الأَعْزَلُ, because it has no star [near] before
it: الرامح is more red. (TA.) ―
