called رَبِيع. (S.) And رُبِعُوا They were rained
upon by the rain of the season called رَبِيع; (K, *
TA;) similar to قِيظُوا and صِيفُوا: (TA in art.
قيظ:) and in like manner, رُبِعَتِ الإِبِلُ The camels
were rained upon by that rain: and مَرْبَعٌ may
be an inf. n. thereof. (Ham p. 425.) ―

in its primary acceptation, signifies He remained,
abode, or dwelt, in the place in the [season called]
رَبِيع; (TA;) as also بِهِ ↓ ارتبع. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  And
hence, (TA,) (tropical:)  He remained, abode, or dwell, in
the place, (K, TA,) in any circumstances, and at
any time; (TA;) he took it as his home. (K.)
―
-b4-  Also He alighted and abode wherever he

-b8-  Also, [app. from رَبَعَ
بِالمَكَانِ in the second of the senses explained
above, and if so, tropical, or doubly tropical,]
aor. َ0, (assumed tropical:)  He (a man, ISk, S) paused, (ISk, S, K,)
and acted, or behaved, with deliberation or in a
leisurely manner, (K,) and withheld himself.
(ISk, S, K.) And [hence,] رَبَعَ عَلَيْهِ, (K,) inf. n.
رَبْعٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He was affectionate, or pitiful, or

gently towards him. (TA.) And رَبَعَ عَنْهُ (K,)
inf. n. رَبْعٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He restrained himself, refrained, abstained, or desisted, from it. (K.)
The phrases اِرْبَعْ عَلَى نَفْسِكَ and اربع على ظَلْعِكَ
(S, K) and اربع عَلَيْكَ (K) are from رَبَعَ in the
sense of “ he paused,” &c., (S, K,) as explained
by ISk, (S,) [or in one of the senses following
that,] meaning (assumed tropical:)  Deal thou gently with thyself;
moderate thyself; restrain thyself: (S, TA:) or
behave thou with deliberation, or in a leisurely
manner: or the second of these phrases may
mean continue thou notwithstanding thy slight
lameness: or it may be from رَبَعَ الحَجَرَ, [q. v.
infrà,] meaning take thou it, or reach it, notwithstanding thy slight lameness. (TA.) The
phrase اِرْبَعِى بِنَفْسِكِ, or عَلَى نَفْسِكِ, in the trad.
of Subey'ah El-Aslameeyeh, accord. to two
different relations, admits of two interpretations:
one is, (assumed tropical:)  Pause thou, and wait for the completion
of the عِدَّة [q. v.] of decease; and this is accord. to
the persuasion of those who say that her عدّة is
the more remote of the two periods, which is the
persuasion of 'Alee and I'Ab: the second is, from
رَبَعَ الرّجُلُ signifying “ the man had, or obtained,
abundance of herbage,” and the meaning is,
(assumed tropical:)  relieve thou thyself, and release thyself from the
straitness of the عدّة, and the evil of thy condition;
and this is accord. to the persuasion of those who
hold that her عدّة is the nearer of the two periods;
and hence 'Omar said, “If she bring forth when
her husband is on his bier, meaning, not buried,
it is allowable for her to marry. ” (TA.) It is
also said, in another trad., لَا يَرْبَعُ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ مَنْ
لَا يُحْزِنُهُ أَمْرُكَ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He will not restrain himself,
and be patient with thee, whom thy case does
not grieve. (TA.) And it is said in a prov.,
حَدِّثِ امْرَأَةً حَدِيثَيْنِ فَإِنْ أَبَتْ فَارْبَعْ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Speak
thou to a woman twice; and if she refuse, abstain
thou: or, accord. to one relation, it is ↓ فَأَرْبِعْ: and
accord. to another, فَارْبَعْهُ, i. e., then add; for she
is very weak in understanding; if she understand
not, then make thou the two speeches to be four:
Aboo-Sa'eed says, فَإِنْ لَمْ تَفْهَمْ بَعْدَ الأَرْبَعَةِ فَالْمِرْبَعَة,
i. e., [and if she understand not after the four,
then] the stick [is to be used; or, then use thou
the stick]: the prov. applies to the hearing and
answering in an evil manner. (TA.) You say
also, رَبَعَتْ عَلَى عَقْلِ فُلَانٍ وَكَسَرَ فِيهَا رِبَاعَهُ, inf. n.
رِبَاعَةٌ, (tropical:)  [app. She behaved in a gentle and coaxing
manner so as to get the better of the reason, or
understanding, of such a one, and he sold his
houses one after another to expend upon her;]
i. e., he expended upon her all that he possessed,
so that he sold his dwellings. (TA. [The و before
كسر is not in the TA; but as it seems to have
been dropped by inadvertence, I have supplied
it.])

heet ” as an epithet to a rope, TA,) applied to a
man, (S, L, &c.,) Of middling stature; (Msb;)
neither tall nor short; (S, L;) between tall and
short: (K:) and so, applied to a woman, ↓ رَبْعَةٌ
(S, Mgh, L, Msb, K) and ↓ رَبَعَةٌ, (L, Msb,) though
originally applied to a man, like خَمْسَةٌ &c.: (L:)
the pl. of رَبْعٌ is رَبْعُونَ: (Fr:) and that of ↓ رَبْعَةٌ
is رَبَعَاتٌ, applied to men and to women, (S, Mgh,
L, K,) and رَبْعَاتٌ also; (IAar, Fr, L, K) the
former of these two pls. being anomalous, because
a word of the measure فَعْلَةٌ has not its medial
radical movent when it is an epithet, but only
when it is a subst. and has not و or ي for that
radical; (S, O, K;) or the medial radical is
movent in this instance because رَبْعَةٌ is originally
a fem. subst. applied to a male and a female, and
used as an epithet; (L;) or because it resembles
a subst. in its being applied alike to a man and a
woman. (Az.)
رُبْعٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ رُبُعٌ, (S, Msb, K,)

signifies also, (S,) the fourth part of the spoil,
which the chief used to take (S, Msb, K) in the
Time of Ignorance: (K:) the pl. of رُبْعٌ and
↓ رُبُعٌ is أَرْبَاعٌ [a pl. of pauc.] (Msb, TA) and رُبُوعٌ
[a pl. of mult]: (TA:) and that of ↓ رَبِيعٌ is رُبُعٌ
(K.) ―
-b2-  الرُّبْعُ الهَاشِمِىُّ The same as the صَاع;
because the قَفِيز is twelve times what is termed

authors differ: (TA:) it is when camels are kept
from the water three days [counting two portions of days as one of those days], or four days
[counting two portions of days as two days (for
the difference is only verbal)], and three [whole]
nights, and come to the water on the fourth day
[counting the day of the next preceding watering
as the first]; (K;) or [in other words] their
coming to the water one day, and leaving it two
days, and then coming to it on the fourth day;
or a period of three [whole] nights and four
days [of which the first and last are incomplete];
as is indicated in the K: or, as some say, [but
this at variance with common usage,] their being
kept from the water four [nights (for the n. of
number is here fem.)], and then coming to it on
the fifth [day (for the n. of number is here
masc.)]. (TA.) You say, وَرَدَتِ الإِبِلُ الرِّبْعَ: see
رَبَعَتِ الإِبِلُ. (S, K.) And وَرَدَتْ إِبِلُهُ رِبْعًا: see

the paragraph:] (TA:) fem. with ة: pl. masc.
رِبَاعٌ [a pl. of mult.] and أَرْبَاعٌ [a pl. of pauc.];
(S, Msb, K;) both irreg.; for accord. to the rule
given by Sb, the pl. should be رِبْعَانٌ [like صرْدَانٌ
pl. of صَرَدٌ]: (TA:) pl. fem. رُبَعَاتٌ (S, Msb, K,
TA [in the CK, erroneously, رَبْعاتٌ]) and رِبَاعٌ.

رُبَاعُ [Four and four: four and four together:

general opinion, because it is at the same time an

رَبِيعٌ: see رُبْعٌ, in two places.
-A2-  It has also a
twofold application; to months and to seasons:
and it has a twofold application to months;
denoting Two months, (S, Msb, K,) [next] after
صَفَرٌ; (S, K;) and they say, (Msb,) one should
only say, in speaking of them, شَهْرُ رَبِيعٍ الأَوَّلُ and
شَهْرُ رَبِيعٍ الآخِرٌ; (S, Msb, K;) [but in the margin
of the copy of the S which I have here followed,
I find it stated that in the handwriting of the
author the former is شهر ربيعِ الاول (with a single
kesreh, and with no syll. sign to الاول); and in
another copy of the S I find شهرُ ربيع الاولِ and
شَهرُ رَبيع الآخِر;] with the addition of شهر: but
it is allowable to say also شَهْرُ رَبِيعِ الأَوَّلِ and
شَهْرُ رَبِيعِ الآخِرِ: the word شهر is necessarily added
in order to discriminate between the months thus
called and the season called ربيع: Az says, the
Arabs mention all the months without the word
شهر except the two months of ربيع and the
month of رَمَضَان: and they say also شَهْرَا رَبِيعٍ
and أَشْهُرُ رَبِيعٍ and شُهُورُ رَبِيعٍ: (Msb:) these
months were thus called because, when they received this name, they occurred in the season
when the earth produced herbage. (Msb in art.
جمد.) It has a twofold application also to
seasons; الرَّبِيعُ الأَوَّلُ being The season in which
the truffles and the blossoms come, (S, Msb, K,)
and this is [also called] رَبِيعُ الكَلَأِ [the rabeea of
the herbage, properly called the spring of Arabia];
(S;) and الرَّبِيعُ الثَّانِى The season in which fruits
ripen; (S, Msb, K;) [also called رَبِيعُ الثِّمَارِ;]
but some people call this الرَّبِيعُ الأَوَّلُ; (S, TA;)
and the season which follows the winter, and in
which the truffles and the blossoms come, they
call الرَّبِيعُ الثَّانِى; but all of them agree that the
خَرِيف [or autumn] is called الرَّبِيعُ: AHn says,
the two divisions of the winter [by which he
means the half-year commencing at the autumnal
equinox] are called رَبِيعَانِ; the former being
رَبِيعُ المَآءِ وَالأَمْطَار ِ [the rabeea of the water and
the rains, in which the rain called الوَسْمِىّ, which
is termed the first of the rains, commences]; and
the second being رَبِيعُ النَّبَاتِ [or رَبِيعُ الكَلَأِ the
rabeea of the herbage], because the herbage
therein attains to its last stage: and he adds, that
رَبِيعٌ is applied by the Arabs to the whole winter,
[meaning, again, the half-year commencing at
the autumnal equinox,] because of the moisture,
or rain: (TA:) or the year consists of six
seasons; (so in the K; but in the S, “and I
heard Abu-l-Ghowth say, the Arabs make the
year to be six seasons; ”) two months thereof are
called الرَّبِيعُ الأَوَّلُ; and two months, صَيْفٌ; and
two months, قَيْظٌ; (S, K;) and two months, ربيع
الثانى, (so in a copy of the S,) or رَبِيعٌ الثّانى, (so
in another copy of the S, [but in the margin of
this latter, I find it stated that in the handwriting of the author it is ربيعُ الثانى, without
tenween,]) or الرَّبِيعُ الثَّانِى; (K;) and two months,
خَرِيفٌ; and two months, شِتَآءٌ. (S, K.) Az relates, with respect to the seasons and divisions of
the year, on the authority of Aboo-Yahyà Ibn-Kibáseh, who possessed very great knowledge
thereof, that the year consists of four seasons;
namely, الرَّبِيعُ الأَوَّلُ, which the vulgar call الخَرِيفُ
[The autumn]; then الشِّتَآءُ [the winter]; then
الصَّيْفُ, which is الرَّبِيعُ الآخِرُ [or الثَّانِى, i. e. the
spring]; then القَيْظُ [the summer, or hot season]:
all this is what the Arabs in the desert say:
the ربيع which is with the Persians the خريف,
he says, commences on the third of أَيْلُول
[September O. S.]; and the شِتَآء, on the third
of كَانُون الأَوَّل [December O. S.]; and the صيف
which is with the Persians the ربيع. on the fifth
of آذَار [March O. S.]; and the قيظ which is
with the Persians the صيف, on the fourth of
حَزِيرَان [June O. S.]: and Aboo-Yahyà adds, the
ربيع of the people of El-' Irák agrees with the
ربيع of the Persians, which is after the شتاء [or
winter], and which is the season of the flowers,
or roses, and is the most temperate of the seasons:
the people of El-' Irák, he says, have rain in all
the winter, and have abundance of herbage in
the خريف, which the Arabs call الربيع الاوّل: and
Az says, the quarter of the خريف is called خريف
because the fruits are gathered therein; and the
Arabs call it ربيع because the first rain [which is
called الوَسْمِىّ] falls therein. (TA.) The pl. of
ربيع is أَرْبِعَةٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and أَرْبِعَآءُ [a pl. of
mult.] (S, Msb, K) and رِبَاعٌ; (AHn, K;) or the
first of these is pl. of ربيع الكلأ (Fr, Yaakoob, S,
Msb, K) and of the ربيع of the months; (Fr,
Msb;) but the second is pl. of ربيع in the sense of
جَدْوَلٌ, to be explained below. (Fr, Yaakoob, S,
Msb, K.) Hence the phrase in a supplication,
mentioned in a trad., اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلِ القُرْآنَ رَبِيعَ قَلْبِى
[O God, make Thou the Kur-án to be the life,
or ease, of my heart]; because the heart of man
becomes lively, or at ease, in the season called
رَبِيع. (TA.) Hence also, (TA,) أَبُو الرَّبِيعِ The
هُدْهُد [or hoopoe]; (K;) because it appears with
the [season called] ربيع. (TA.) [See also, respecting the seasons &c., the word زَمَنٌ.] ―
-b2-  Also
The rain in the [season called] رَبيع [as meaning
the half-year commencing at the autumnal equinox,
(which includes what is really the spring of
Arabia, called “ the rabeea of the herbage,”)
accord. to a statement of AHn cited above, and
accord. to what is stated on the authority of AZ
voce نَوْءٌ]: (S, K:) or [only, accord. to some,] the
rain which is after the وَسْمِىّ, and after which is
[that called] the صَيْف, and then the حَمِيم: or,
accord. to AHn, rain whenever it comes: Az
says, I have heard the Arabs call thus the first
rain falling upon the earth in the days of the
خَرِيف [or autumn]: (TA:) the pl. [of pauc.] is
أَرْبِعَةٌ and [of mult.] رِبَاعٌ. (AHn, TA.) [See also,
respecting the rains, the word زَمَنٌ.] ―
-b3-  Also
Herbage; green herbage which the beasts eat;
(TA;) [properly] the herbage that is produced
by the first rain in the quarter which is called
the رَبِيع, and which is commonly called the خَرِيف
[or autumn], (Msb in art. زمن,) [continuing its
growth during the winter-quarter, which is also
called the رَبِيع, and which includes, as stated
above, what is really the spring of Arabia, called
“ the rabeea of the herbage,” wherein, as AHn
says, the herbage attains to its last stage: it seems
generally to mean the spring-herbage, which is
earlier or later in different latitudes:] pl. أَرِْبعَةٌ.
(TA.) [Hence,] a poet says,
يَدَاكَ يَدٌ رَبِيعُ النَّاسِ فِيهَا
وَفِى الأُخْرَى الشُّهُورُ مِنَ الحَرَامِ
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Thy two hands are such that] one hand
has in it the means of the plentiful subsistence of
mankind, [and in the other are the sacred months,
i. e.] in the other is [that which causes] security,
and safeguard, and the preservation of what is to
be regarded as sacred and inviolable. (TA.)

402:) (tropical:)  a rivulet, or streamlet, that runs to palmtrees: and رَبِيعُ السَّاقِى, a subst prefixed to its
epithet, occurring in a trad., (assumed tropical:)  the river [or
rivulet] that waters seed-produce: (TA:) pl.
أَرْبِعَآءُ (Fr, Yaakoob, S, Msb, K) and رِبْعَانٌ. (TA.)
A poet says, describing one drinking much,
فُوهُ رَبِيعٌ وَكَفُّهُ قَدَحٌ
(assumed tropical:)  His mouth is a river [and his hand is a bowl].
(TA.) ―
-b5-  Also A share, or portion, of water for
[irrigating] land, (IDrd, K, TA,) whatever it be:

the quarter of a day or night; but this is not of
valid authority. (TA.) You say, لِفُلَانٍ مِنْ هٰذَا
المَآءِ رَبِيعٌ, (K, TA,) or, as in some copies of the
K, فِى, instead of مِنْ, i. e. To such a one belongs

used to say, مَضَى الأَرْبِعَآءُ بِمَا فِيهِ [Wednesday
passed with what (occurred) in it], making it
sing. and masc. [because he meant thereby يَوْمُ
الأَرْبِعَآءُ]; but Abu-l-Jarráh used to say, مَضَتِ
الأَرْبِعَآءُ بِمَا فِيهِنَّ, making it fem. and pl., and
