the head of a kid, S, K, or of a lamb, K, or of a

fast, or bound or tied fast or firmly, him, or it,
in the رِبْقَة: (TA:) or he made fast, or bound or
tied fast or firmly, his (a sheep's or goat's) neck
with the رِبْق, or cord: (JK:) and ↓ ربّقهُ, inf. n.
تَرْبِيقٌ, he made fast, or bound or tied fast or

ربّق [He prepared the أَرْبَاق, pl. of رِبْقٌ].
One says, رَمَّدِتِ الضَّأْنُ فَرَبّقْ رَبّقْ, i.e. [The ewes
have secreted milk in their udders: therefore]
prepare thou the أَرْبَاق: prepare thou the ارباق:
for they will bring forth soon: (S, K:) because
they [begin to] secrete milk in their udders عَلَى
رَأْسِ الوَلَدِ [i. e. at the time of bringing forth, or
when about to produce the young]. (S.) It is
not thus in the case of she-goats: therefore, (S,)
in the case of these, one says رَنّقْ, with ن,
(S, K,) meaning “ wait thou: ” because they show
sings of pregnancy in the state of their udders,
and bring forth after some length of time: and
[in the case of these] one says also رَمِّقْ, with م.
(K. [See arts. رمق and رنق.]) ―
-b2-  One also says,
رَبَّقَ أَثْنَآءَ الحَبْلِ, meaning He made loops in the
middle of the rope to put upon the necks of the
young lambs or kids. (T in art. ثنى.) ―
-b3-  See
also 1. ―
-b4-  رَبَّقْتُ الكَلَامَ I interlarded, or embel-lished, the speech, or discourse, with falsehood;
as also رَمَّقْتُهُ; syn. لَفَّقْتُ بَيْنَهُ; (JK;) [or لَفَّقْتُهُ;
for] تَرْبِيقُ الكَلَامِ signifies تَلْفِيقُهُ; (Ibn-'Abbád,
K;) as also تَرْمِيقُهُ. (Ibn-'Abbád.)
5
تَرَبَّقْتُ الشَّىْءَ, (JK,) or تربّقتهُ مِنْ عُنُقِى,
(Ibn-'Abbád, K,) (tropical:)  I hung the thing upon my
neck. (JK, Ibn-'Abbád, K, TA.)
8
ارتبق He (a kid) had his head put into the
رِبْقَة. (S.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] ارتبق فِى حِبَالَتِى He (a
gazelle, S, K) became caught in my snare. (Lh,
JK, S, K.) ―
-b3-  And ارتبقتُ فِى حِبَالَتِهِ (tropical:)  I became
caught in [the snare of] his deceit. (TA.) ―
-b4-
And ارتبق فِى الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  He fell into the thing, or
affair. (Msb, K.)
-A2-  اِرْتَبَقْتُهُ لِنَفْسِى I tied, bound,
or made fast, him, or it, for myself. (TA.)
رِبْقٌ A cord having in it a number of loops
wherewith lambs, or kids, are tied, or made fast;
any one of which loops is termed ↓ رِبْقَةٌ (S, Msb,
K) and ↓ رَبْقَةٌ: (K:) or a cord which is doubled
in the form of a ring, into which is put the head
of a sheep or goat, and which is then tied, or
made fast: so, says Az, I have heard from the
Arabs of the desert of Benoo-Temeem: (TA:)
pl. [of mult.] رِبَاقٌ (S, Msb, K) and رِبَقٌ and [of
pauc.] أَرْبَاقٌ. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) خَلَعَ
الإِسْلَامِ مِنْ عُنُقِهِ ↓ رِبْقَةَ, (S, Msb, TA,) occurring
in a trad., (S,) (tropical:)  He cast off the tie of El-Islám,
(Msb, TA,) with which he had bound himself,
(TA,) [from his neck.] (Msb, TA. [See also
خَلَعَ.]) And لَكُمُ العَهْدُ مَا لَمْ تَأْكُلُوا الرِّبَاقَ, also
occurring in a trad., (S,) meaning (tropical:)  [The covenant is yours] as long as ye sever not the tie with
which ye are bound; this tie being likened to the
رِبْق upon the necks of lambs or kids; and the
severing thereof, to the beast's eating its رِبْق, and
severing it; for thereby the beast becomes free
from the tie. (TA.) And in a trad. of 'Omar,
حُجُّوا بِالذُّرِّيَّةِ لَا تَأْكُلُوا أَرْزَاقَهَا وَتَذَرُوا أَرْبَاقَهَا فِى
أَعْنَاقِهَا [Perform ye the pilgrimage with the
women: devour not their means of subsistence,
while ye leave their ties upon their necks]: he
likens the obligations imposed upon them to ارباق.
(TA.) One says also, ↓ حَلَّ رِبْقَتَهُ, meaning (tropical:)  He
removed from him his anxiety: (K, TA:) and so
↓ قَطَعَ رِبْقَتَهُ. (TA.)
رَبْقَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
رِبْقَةٌ: see رِبْقٌ, in four places. ―
-b2-  Also A thing
woven of black wool, of the width of the تِكَّة [or
band of the drawers or trowsers], in which is a
red stripe of dyed wool: its extremities are tied
together, and then it is hung upon the neck [or
shoulder] of a boy, so that one of his arms comes
forth from it like as when a man puts forth one
of his arms from the suspensory of the sword:
the Arabs of the desert hang the رِبَق [pl. of رِبْقَةٌ]
upon the necks of their boys only as a preservative from the [evil] eye. (T, TA.)
رِبِقَّانٌ and رِبِقَّانَةٌ Evil in disposition: applied to
a man; and in like manner to a woman: mentioned by As and in the K in art. عبق [where,
in some copies, it is written رَبْقَانُ]. (TA.)
رَبِيقٌ, (TA,) or رَبِيقَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) applied to a
lamb or kid (بَهْمَة), (ISk, S, K,) or to a sheep or
goat (شَاة), (Msb, TA,) Having its head put into
the رِبْقَة; (ISk, S, Msb, K, TA;) as also ↓ مَرْبُوقَةٌ
(ISk, JK, S, Msb, K) and ↓ مُرَبَّقَةٌ. (JK, TA.)
أُمُّ الرُّبَيْقِ Calamity, or misfortune: (JK, S,
K:) whence the prov., جَآءَنَا بِأمِّ الرُّبَيْقِ عَلَى أُرَيْقِ,
(TA,) meaning He brought us a great calamity,
or misfortune: (K in art. ارق:) As says that the
Arabs assert it to have been said by a man who
saw the ghool upon a dusky white camel (جَمَل
أَوْرَق); (S in that art., and TA;) أُرَيْق being the
dim. of أَوْرَق: (K in that art.:) or امّ الربيق is a
name of war, or battle: or the viper: (JK,
Ibn-'Abbád, TA:) this last signification is held
to be correct by Z, because, he says, the viper is
short, and when it folds itself it resembles the
رِبَق (TA.)
تِرْبِيقٌ A cord with which a ewe, or goat, is tied
(K, TA) by the neck. (TA.)
مُرْبِقٌ i. q. مُطْرِقٌ [Silent: or lowering the eyes,
looking towards the ground: &c.]. (JK, TA.)
مُرَبَّقَةٌ: see رَبِيقٌ.
-A2-  Also, [or خُبْزَةٌ مُرَبَّقَةٌ,] A
cake of bread, or one baked in ashes, into which
fat has been put; syn. خُبْزَةٌ مُشَحَّمَةٌ. (K.)
مَرْبُوقَةٌ: see رَبِيقٌ
