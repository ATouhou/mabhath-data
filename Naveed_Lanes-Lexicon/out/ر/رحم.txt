رَحَمَ, (K,) inf. n.
رَحْمَةٌ and رُحْمٌ [and رَحَمَةٌ and رُحُمٌ] and مَرْحَمَةٌ,
(S, * Msb, K, *) [He had mercy, or pity, or compassion, on him; or he treated him, or regarded
him, with mercy or pity or compassion; i. e.] he
was, or became, tender [or tender-hearted] towards
him; and inclined to favour him [and to benefit
him]: (S, Msb, K: [see also رَخِمَهُ and رَخَمَهُ:])
and he pardoned him, or forgave him: (K:) said
of a man: (S, Msb, K:) and also of God [in the
former sense, but tropically, or anthropopathically:
or as meaning He favoured him, or benefited him;
or pardoned, or forgave, him: see explanations
of رَحْمَةٌ below]: (Msb, K:) and عَلَيْهِ ↓ ترحّم signifies the same, (MA, [and the same seems to be
indicated in the S,]) said of a man: (S:) [and so
does ↓ ترحّمهُ, (occurring in the S and K in art.
رعى, &c.,) accord. to Ibn-Maaroof, for he says
that] تَرَحُّمٌ signifies the regarding [another] with
mercy or pity or compassion; or pardoning [him],
or forgiving [him]: and also the being merciful
or pitiful or compassionate or favourably inclined
[عَلَى غَيْرِهِ to another]. (KL: but respecting this
latter verb, see 2.)
-A2-  رَحُمَتْ, and رَحِمَتْ, (S, K,)
and رُحِمَتْ, (K,) inf. n. رَحَامَةٌ, (S, K,) which is
of the first, (S, TA,) and رَحَمٌ, (S, K,) which is
of the second, (S, TA,) and رَحْمٌ, (K,) which is
of the third, (TA,) She had a complaint of her
womb after bringing forth, (S, K,) and died in
consequence thereof: (K:) said of a camel, (S,
TA,) and of a ewe or goat, and of a woman, and
of any animal having a womb: (TA:) or she had
a disease in her womb, in consequence of which
she did not receive impregnation: or she brought
forth without letting fall her secundine: (K,
TA:) or, accord. to Lh, the bringing forth without letting fall her secundine, by a sheep or goat,
is termed ↓ رُحَامٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  رَحِمَ, aor.
رَحَمَ, inf. n.
رَحَمٌ, is also said of a water-skin, meaning It was
left, or neglected, by its owners, after its being
seasoned with rob, [for غيته, in the phrase بعد
غيته, an evident mistranscription, I read, conjecturally, تَمْتِينِهِ, as the only word at all resembling غيته, that I can call to mind, having an
apposite signification,] and they did not anoint it,
or grease it, so that it became spoilt, or in a bad
state, and did not retain the water: the epithet
applied to it in this case is ↓ رَحِمٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And
رَحَامَةٌ is also an inf. n. [of which the verb, if it
have one, is app. رَحُمَ,] signifying The being connected by relationship. (TA.)
2
رحّم عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. تَرْحِيمٌ; and ↓ ترحّم; but
the former is the more chaste; He said to him,
رَحِمَكَ اللّٰهُ [May God have mercy on thee;
&c.]. (K.)
5
ترحّم عَلَيْهِ and
ترحّمهُ: for both see 1; and
for the former see also 2. [Accord. to different
authorities, it appears that both may be rendered
He had mercy, or pity, or compassion, on him;
or he pitied, or compassionated, him: (see 1:) or
he pitied him, or compassionated him, much: (see
what follows:) and the former, he said to him,
May God have mercy on thee; &c.; (see 2;) or
he expressed a wish that God would have mercy
on him; or he expressed pity, or compassion, for
him: and also he affected, or constrained himself
to have or to show, pity, or compassion.] Though
تَرَحَّمْتُ عَلَيْهِ is mentioned by J, and not رَحَّمّهُ,
some say that the former is incorrect: and it is said
that تَرَحُّمٌ implies self-constraint, and therefore is
not to be attributed to God: but some repudiate
this assertion, because it occurs in correct traditions, and because تَفَعُّلٌ is not restricted to the
denoting peculiarly self-constraint, but has other
properties, as in the instances of تَوَحُّدٌ and تَكَبُّرٌ,
denoting intensiveness and muchness. (TA.)
6
تراحموا signifies رَحِمَ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا [They had
mercy, or pity, or compassion, one on another;
&c.]. (S, TA.)
10
استرحمهُ He asked, or demanded, of him
الرَّحْمَة [i. e. mercy, or pity, or compassion; &c.].
(TA.)
رَحْمٌ: see its syn. رَحِمٌ, in two places.
رُحْمٌ: see its syn. رَحْمَةٌ. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] أُمُّ رُحْمٍ
one of the names of Mekkeh; (S, K; *) as also
أُمُّ الرُّحْمِ; (K;) meaning the source of الرَّحْمَة
[or mercy, &c.]. (TA.) [See also زُحْمٌ.]
رِحْمٌ: see its syn. رَحِمٌ, in two places.
رَحَمٌ The coming forth of the womb, in consequence of a disease. (IAar, TA.) [See also رَحِمَتْ
and رَحِمَ, of each of which it is an inf. n.]
رَحِمٌ The womb, i. e. the place of origin, (Mgh,
Msb, K,) and the receptacle, (Mgh, K,) of the
young, (Mgh, Msb, K,) in the belly; (Mgh;) as
also ↓ رِحْمٌ, (Msb, K,) a contraction of the former,
and ↓ رَحْمٌ, which is of the dial. of Benoo-Kiláb:
(Msb:) in this sense, (Msb,) which is the primary signification, (Mgh,) [i. e.] as meaning the
رَحِم of the female, (S,) it is fem.; (S, Msb;) or,
as some say, masc.; (Msb;) but IB cites a verse
in which رِحْم is fem.: (TA:) pl. أَرْحَامٌ. (MA.)
―
-b2-  Hence, (Mgh, Msb,) as also ↓ رِحْمٌ (S, Msb,
K) and ↓ رَحْمٌ, (Msb,) (tropical:)  Relationship; i. e. nearness of kin; syn. قَرَابَةٌ: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) [by
some restricted to relationship by the female side;
as will be shown below:] and connexion by birth:
(Mgh, Msb:) or relationship connecting with a
father or an ancestor: or near relationship: so
in the T: (TA:) or a connexion, or tie, of relationship: (A, TA:) or the ties of relationship:
(M, K, TA:) accord. to the K, الرَّحِمُ signifies
القَرَابَةُ or أَصْلُهَا and أَسْبَابُهَا: but in the M it is said,
الرَّحِمُ أَسْبَابُ القَرَابَةِ وَأَصْلُهَا الرَّحِمُ الَّتِى هِىَ مَنْبِتُ
الوَلَدِ; in which وَأَصْلُهَا forms no part of the explanation of الرحم, as the author of the K asserts
it to do: (TA:) as meaning relationship, رحم is
in most instances masc.: (Msb:) pl. as above.
(K.) It is said in a holy tradition (حَدِيث قُدْسِىّ
[i. e. an inspired or a revealed tradition]) that
God said, when He created الرَّحِم [meaning “ relationship,” &c.], أَنَا الَّحْمٰنُ وَأَنْتَ الرَّحِمُ شَقَقْتُ
اسْمَكَ مِنِ اسْمِى فَمَنْ وَصَلَكَ وَصَلْتُهُ وَمَنْ قَطَعَكَ
قَطَعْتُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [I am الرحمٰن and thou art الرحم: I
have derived thy name from my name: therefore
whoso maketh thee close, I will make him close;
and who severeth thee, I will sever him]. (TA.)
[وَصَلَ رَحِمَهُ means (assumed tropical:)  He made close his tie, or
ties, of relationship, by kind behaviour to his
kindred: and قَطَعَ رَحِمَهُ, He severed his tie, or
ties, of relationship, by unkind behaviour to his
kindred: see art. وصل: and see also بَلَّ رَحِمَهُ,
in the first paragraph of art. بل; and a verse
there cited.] ―
-b3-  ذُو الرَّحِمِ means (assumed tropical:)  [The possessor
of relationship, &c.; i. e.] the contr. of الأَجْنَبِىُّ:
(Mgh, Msb:) the pl. ذَوُو الأَرْحَامِ, [or, as in the
Kur viii. last verse, and xxxiii. 6, أُولُو الأَرْحَامِ,]
in the classical language, means any relations:
and in law, any relations that have no portion
[of the inheritances termed فَرَائِض] and are not
[such heirs as are designated by the appellation]
عَصَبَة [q. v.]; (KT, TA in art. ذو;) [i. e.,] with
respect to the فَرَائِض, it means the relations by
the women's side. (IAth, TA in the present art.)
ذُو رَحِمٍ مَحْرَمٍ and [some say] مُحَرَّمٍ [and ذُو رَحِمٍ
مَحْرَمٌ also (see art. حرم)] mean (assumed tropical:)  A relation whom
it is unlawful to marry, [whether male or female,
the latter being included with the former, but the
female, when particularly meant, is termed ذَاتُ
رَحِمٍ مَحْرَمٍ &c.,] such as the mother and the
daughter and the sister and the paternal aunt
and the maternal aunt [and the male relations of
such degrees]: and most of the learned, of the
Companions and of the generation following
these, and Aboo-Haneefeh and his companions,
and Ahmad [Ibn-Hambal], hold that when one
possesses a person that is termed ذُو رَحِمٍ مَحْرَمٍ,
this person becomes emancipated, whether male
or female; but Esh-Sháfi'ee and others of the
Imáms and of the Companions and of the generation following these hold that the children and
the fathers and the mothers become emancipated,
and not any others than these. (IAth, TA.) ―
-b4-
[حَاسَّةُ رَحِمٍ means (assumed tropical:)  A feeling of relationship or
consanguinity, or sympathy of blood; and in like
manner, elliptically, رَحِمٌ alone. You say, أَطَّتْ
لَهُ مِنِّى حَاسَّةُ رَحِمٍ; expl. in art. حس: and أَطَّتْ
لَهُ رَحِمِى; and أَطَّتْ بِكَ الرَّحِمُ; expl. in art. اط.
―
-b5-  رَحِمٌ is also often used for فَرْجٌ or حَيَآءٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  The vulva: see, for exs., شُفْرٌ, and 1 in art.
ظآر, and 8 in art. حوص.]
-A2-  As an epithet, with
ة, applied to a she-camel: see رَحُومٌ. ―
-b2-  And as
an epithet without ة, applied to a water-skin: see
1, last sentence but one.
رُحُمٌ: see the next paragraph.
-A2-  It is also pl.
of رَحُومٌ. (TA.)
رَحْمَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ رَحَمَةٌ (Sb, K) and
↓ رُحْمٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ رُحُمٌ, (S, K,) thus in a
verse of Zuheyr, (S, TA,) and thus in the Kur
xviii. 80 accord. to the reading of Aboo-'Amr
Ibn-El-'Alà, (TA,) and ↓ مَرْحَمَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,)
of which last مَرَاحِمُ is pl., (TA,) [all inf. ns.;
when used as simple substs. signifying Mercy,
pity, or compassion; i. e.] tenderness (S, Msb, K,
and Bd on the بَسْمَلَة) of heart; (Bd ibid.;) and
inclination to favour, (S, Msb, K,) or inclination
requiring the exercise of favour and beneficence:
(Bd ubi suprà:) and pardon, or forgiveness: (K:)
accord. to Er-Rághib, رَحْمَةٌ signifies tenderness
requiring the exercise of beneficence towards the
object thereof: and it is used sometimes as meaning tenderness divested of any other attribute:
and sometimes as meaning beneficence divested
of tenderness; as when it is used as an attribute
of the Creator: when used as an attribute of men,
it means tenderness, and inclination to favour
[without necessarily implying beneficence]: accord.
to El-Káshánee, it is of two kinds; namely, gratuitous, and obligatory: the former is that which
pours forth favours, or benefits, antecedently to
works; and this is the رحمة that embraces everything: the obligatory is that which is promised
to the pious and the doers of good, in the Kur
vii. 155 and vii. 54: but this, he says, is included
in the gratuitous, because the promise to bestow it
for works is purely gratuitous: accord. to the explanation of the Imám Aboo-Is-hák Ahmad Ibn-Mohammad-Ibn-Ibráheem Eth-Thaalebee, it is
God's desire to do good to the deserving thereof;
so that it is an essential attribute: or the abstaining from punishing him who deserves punishment,
and doing good to him who does not deserve
[this]; so that it is an attribute of operation.
(TA.) The saying in the Kur [xxi. 75] وَأَدْخَلْنَاهُ
فِى رَحْمَتِنَا (tropical:)  [And we caused him to enter into our
mercy] is tropical: so says IJ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  وَاللّٰهُ
يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِ مَنْ يَشَآءُ, in the Kur [ii. 99 and
iii. 67], means (assumed tropical:)  [And God distinguishes] with
his gift of prophecy [whom He will], or his prophetic office or commission. (K, * TA.) ―
-b3-  رَحْمَةٌ
also means (assumed tropical:)  Sustenance, or the means of subsistence: this is said to be its meaning as used in
the Kur xli. 50. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  Rain: (TA:)
so in the Kur vii. 55. (Bd, Jel.) ―
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  Plenty;
or abundance of herbage, and of the goods, conveniences, or comforts, of life: so in the Kur x. 22
and xxx. 35. (TA.)
رَحَمَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
رُحْمَى [The saying رَحِمَكَ اللّٰهُ May God have
mercy on thee; &c.;] a subst. from رَحَّمَ عَلَيْهِ
[like بُقْيَا from أَبْقَى عَلَيْهِ]. (K.)
رَحْمَآءُ: see رَحُومٌ.
الرَّحْمٰنُ [thus generally written when it has
the article ال prefixed to it, but in other cases
رَحْمَانُ, imperfectly decl.,] and ↓ الرَّحِيمُ are names
[or epithets] applied to God: (TA:) [the former,
considered as belonging to a large class of words
expressive of passion or sensation, such as غَضْبَانُ
and عَطْشَانُ &c., but, being applied to God, as
being used tropically, or anthropopathically, may
be rendered The Compassionate: ↓ the latter, considered as expressive of a constant attribute with
somewhat of intensiveness, agreeably with analogy, may be rendered the Merciful: but they
are variously explained: it is said that] they are
both names [or epithets] formed to denote intensiveness of signification, from رَحِمَ; like الغَضْبَانُ
from غَضِبَ, and العَلِيمُ from عَلِمَ; and الرَّحْمَةُ, in
the proper language, is “ tenderness of heart,”
and “ inclination requiring the exercise of favour
and beneficence; ” but the names of God are
only to be taken [or understood] with regard to
the ultimate imports, which are actions, exclusively of the primary imports, which may be
passions: and the former is more intensive in
signification than the latter; the former including
in its objects the believer and the unbeliever,
and ↓ the latter having for its peculiar object the
believer: (Bd on the بَسْمَلَة:) accord. to J, (TA,)
they are two names [or epithets] derived from
الرَّحْمَةُ, and are like نَدْمَانُ and نَدِيمٌ, and are
syn.; the repetition being allowable when the
[mode of] derivation is different, for the purpose
of corroboration: (S, TA:) or the repetition is
because the former is Hebrew, [originally 165,]
and ↓ the latter is Arabic: (I'Ab, TA:) but the
former is applicable to God only; though Museylimeh the Liar was called رَحْمَانُ اليَمَامَةِ; (S,
TA;) and it is said to mean the Possessor of the
utmost degree of الرَّحْمَة; and accord. to Zj, is a
name of God mentioned in the most ancient
books: (TA:) whereas ↓ the latter is syn. with
↓ الرَّاحِمُ: (S, TA:) or [rather] ↓ رَاحِمٌ is the act.
part. n. [signifying having mercy, &c.], and
↓ رَحِيمٌ has an intensive signification [i. e. having
much mercy, &c.]: (Msb:) the latter is applied
also to a man; and so is ↓ رَحُومٌ, in the same
sense, and likewise to a woman: (TA:) the pl. of
↓ رَحِيمٌ is رُحَمَآءُ; (Msb, TA;) occurring in the trad.,
إِنَّمَا يَرْحَمُ اللّٰهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ الرُّحَمَآءَ, or الرُّحَمَآءُ, as
related by different persons; [i. e. God has mercy
on the merciful only of his servants, or verily
those on whom God has mercy, of his servants,
are the merciful;] الرحماء being in the accus.
case as the objective complement of يرحم, and in
the nom. case as the enunciative of ما in the sense
of الَّذِى. (Msb.)
رَحَمُوتٌ is from رَحْمَةٌ, [with which it is syn.,]
(S, TA,) but it is used only coupled with its like
in form: (K, TA:) one says, رَهَبُوتٌ خَيْرٌ لَكَ مِنْ
رَحَمُوتٍ [Fear is better for thee than pity, or
compassion], meaning thy being feared is better
than thy being pitied, or compassionated: (S, K:
but in the former, without لك:) or, accord. to
Mbr, ↓ رَهَبُوتَى خَيْرٌ مِنْ رَحَمُوتَى. (Meyd. [See
art. رهب.])
رَحَمُوتَى: see what next precedes.
رُحَامٌ: see 1, last sentence but two.
رَحُومٌ (Lh, S, K) and ↓ رَحْمَآءُ, (K,) applied to
a she-camel, (Lh, S, TA,) and to a ewe or she-goat, and to a woman, (TA,) [and app. to any
animal having a womb, (see رَحُمَتْ)] Having a
complaint of her womb (Lh, S, M, K) after
bringing forth, (Lh, S, K,) and dying in consequence thereof; (K;) and ↓ رَحِمَةٌ, applied to a
she-camel, signifies the same: the pl. of رَحُومٌ is
رُحُمٌ, with two dammehs. (TA.) ―
-b2-  For the first,
see also الرَّحْمٰنُ, near the end of the paragraph.
رَحِيمُ: see الرَّحْمٰنُ, in seven places. ―
-b2-  Sometimes it is syn. with ↓ مَرْحُومٌ [i. e. Treated, or
regarded, with mercy or pity or compassion;
&c.: see 1, first sentence]: 'Amelles Ibn-'Akeel
says, (using it in this sense, Ham p. 628,)
فَأَمَّا إِذَا عَضَّتْ بِكَ الحَرْبُ عَضَّةً
فَإِنَّكَ مَعْطُوفٌ عَلَيْكَ رَحِيمُ
(S, and Ham,) i. e. [But at all events,] when war
becomes [once] severe to thee, and thine enemy
has almost overcome thee, [verily thou art regarded with favour,] treated with mercy, and
defended, by us. (Ham.)
رَاحِمٌ: see الرَّحْمٰنُ, in two places, in the latter
half of the paragraph. ―
-b2-  Also, applied to a ewe,
and to a she-goat, Having the womb swollen.
(Lh, K.)
أَرْحَمُ [More, and most, merciful, &c.]. God is
أَرْحَمُ الرَّاحِمينَ [The Most Merciful of those that
have mercy]. (TA.)
مَرْحَمَةٌ: see رَحْمَةٌ.
مُرَحَّمٌ [Treated, or regarded, with much mercy
or pity or compassion; &c.]: it is with teshdeed
to denote intensiveness of the signification. (S,
TA.) ―
-b2-  [See also 2, of which it is the pass.
part. n.]
مَرْحُومٌ: see رَحِيمٌ. ―
-b2-  المَرْحُومَةُ is a name of
El-Medeeneh. (K.) ―
-b3-  [And المَرْحُومُ, which
may be rendered The object of God's mercy, is
commonly used in the present day as an epithet
applied to the person, whoever he be, that has
died in what is believed to be the true faith; as
though meaning merely the deceased.]

and in like manner, رَحَا القَوْمِ the collective body
of the people, or party. (ISk, TA.) ―
-b15-  رَحَى القَوْمِ
signifies [also] (tropical:)  The chief of the people, or party.
(T, S, M, K, TA.) [It is added in the TA that
'Omar Ibn-El-Khattáb was called رَحَى الحَرْبِ,
as though meaning (assumed tropical:)  The chief of war; because
of his warlike propensities: but it seems from
what here follows, as well as from what precedes,
that this may be a mistranscription, for رَحَى القَوْمِ
or رَحَى العَرَبِ.] ―
-b16-  رَحَى الحَرْبِ signifies (tropical:)  The
most vehement part [or the thickest] of the fight;
syn. حَوْمَتُهَا: (S, Msb:) in the K it is said that
الرَّحَى signifies حَوْمَةُ الحَرْبِ, and مُعْظَمُهُ; as also
↓ المَرْحَى: but it seems that there is an omission;
for الحرب is [generally] fem., and in the M it is
said that رَحَى المَوْتِ signifies مُعْظَمُهُ [app. meaning the main stress, or the thickest, of death in
battle]. (TA.) In a saying relating to 'Alee's
having made an end of الجَمَلِ ↓ مَرْحَي, this
expression is expl. by A 'Obeyd as meaning The
place around which revolved the thickest of the
fight (المَوْضِعُ الَّذِي دَارَتْ عَلَيْهِ رَحَي الحَرْبِ) [in
the Battle of the Camel]. (TA.) And دَارَتْ عَلَيْهِ
رَحَي المَوْتِ [which may be rendered (assumed tropical:)  The main
stress of death beset him round about] means
death befell him. (Msb, TA.)
