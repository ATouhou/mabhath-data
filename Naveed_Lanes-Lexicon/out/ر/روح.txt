became, cool and pleasant [by means of the wind].
(L.) It (a house, or tent, the door being opened,)
[was, or became, aired by the wind; or] was
entered by the wind. (L.) ―
-b3-  راح الشَّجَرُ The
trees felt the wind. (AHn, K.) [See also another
meaning below.] ―
-b4-  [Hence, perhaps,] راح, aor.
يَرَاحُ, inf. n. رَاحٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, brisk,
lively, sprightly, active, agile, prompt, or quick;
[as though he felt the wind and was refreshed by
it;] (L;) as also ↓ ارتاح: (S, A, L, K:) رَاحٌ and
↓ اِرْتِيَاحٌ signify the same: (S, L, K: [in the CK,
الاِرْتِياحِ is erroneously put for الاِرْتِيَاحُ:]) and
↓ اِسْتَرْوَحَ (assumed tropical:)  he (a man) became light, or active, and

[(assumed tropical:)  And thou assertedst that thou dost not, or wilt
not, betake thyself with briskness, &c., to women,
nor be rejoiced by them]. (Lth, TA.) And راح
لِلْأَمْرِ i. q. ↓ ارتاح [He betook himself with briskness, &c., to the thing, or affair; or was brisk,

K,) and إِلَيْهِ, (L,) aor. يَرَاحٌ, inf. n. رَوَاحٌ and رُؤُوحٌ
and رَاحٌ and رِيَاحَةٌ (L, K) and رَاحَةٌ and أَرْيَحِيَّةٌ,
(L,) (assumed tropical:)  He brightened in countenance at that
thing, (L, [there explained by أَشْرَقَ لَهُ, and this
I regard as the right reading, rather than that
which I find in the copies of the K, which is
أَشْرَفَ لَهُ, perhaps meaning the same as أَشْرَفَ عَلَيْهِ,
i. e. he became acquainted with that thing, or
knew it, syn. اِطَّلَعَ عَلَيْهِ,]) and rejoiced in it, or
at it, (L, K,) and was thereby affected with
alacrity, cheerfulness, briskness, liveliness, or
sprightliness, disposing him to promptness in acts
of kindness or beneficence: said of a generous
man when he is asked to confer a gift; and sometimes, metaphorically, of dogs when called by
their owner, and of other animals. (L.) [It is
also said that] رَوَاحٌ and رَوَاحَةٌ and رَاحَةٌ and رَوْحَةٌ
and رَوِيحَةٌ [all app. inf. ns. of رَاحَ, or some of
them may be simple substs.,] and مُرَايَحَةٌ [as
though inf. n. of ↓ رَايَحَ] (L, K) signify (assumed tropical:)  The
experiencing relief from grief or sorrow, after
suffering therefrom: (L:) or the experiencing
the joy, or happiness, arising from certainty.
(K. [See also رَوْحٌ, below.]) You say also,
إِلَى حَدِيثِهِ ↓ اِسْتَرْوَحْتُ [app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  I was
affected with cheerfulness, liveliness, or the like,
at his discourse, or narration; as seems to be
indicated by the context in the place where it is
mentioned: or perhaps, he trusted to his discourse,
and became quiet, or easy, in mind; agreeably
with an explanation of the verb which see below]:
(A:) or الى حديثه ↓ استراح (assumed tropical:)  he inclined to his
discourse. (MA.) And راح لِلْمَعْرُوفِ, (S, A, L,
K,) sec. pers. رِحْتَ, (L,) aor. يَرَاحُ, inf. n. رَاحَةٌ
(S, L, K) and رِيحٌ; (L;) and له ↓ ارتاح; (A, L;)

or beneficence. (L.) And لِلنَّدَى ↓ ارتاح (assumed tropical:)  [He
was affected with alacrity, &c., and so disposed

اللّٰهُ بِرَحْمَتِهِ فَأَنْقَذَهُ مِنْهَا ↓ بِهِ بَلِيَّةٌ فَارْتَاحَ (tropical:)  [A trial,
or an affliction, befell him, and God was active
and prompt with his mercy, and delivered him
from it]: (T:) but ISd disapproves of thus
speaking of God; and El-Fárisee says that it is
an instance of the rudeness of speech characteristic of Arabs of the desert. (TA.) [Hence
seems to have originated, as is app. implied in
the TA, the assertion that] ↓ الاِرْتِيَاحُ signifies
(assumed tropical:)  The being merciful: and اللّٰهُ لَهُ بِرَحْمَتِهِ ↓ ارتاح,
(assumed tropical:)  God delivered him from trial, or affliction:
(K:) or اللّٰهُ لِفُلَانٍ ↓ ارتاح (assumed tropical:)  God was merciful to
such a one. (S.) One also says, راحت يَدُهُ لِكَذَا,
(K,) or بِكَذَا, (S L,) (tropical:)  His hand was active,
prompt, or quick, (S, L, K, TA,) to do such a
thing, (K, TA,) or with such a thing; (S, L, TA;)
as, for instance, with a sword, to strike with it.
(L.) Hence the saying of the Prophet, مَنْ رَاحَ
إِلَى الجُمُعَةِ فِى السَّاعَةِ الأُولَى فَكَأَنَّمَا قَدَّمَ بَدَنَةً
(tropical:)  [Whosoever is brisk, or prompt, or quick, in
repairing to the Friday-prayers in the first
hour, he is as though he offered a camel, or a
cow or bull, for sacrifice at Mekkeh]: (K, * TA:)
the meaning is, خَفَّ إِلَيْهَا, (K, TA,) and مَضَى;
(TA;) not the going in the latter part of the
day. (K, * TA.) [See also what follows.] ―
-b5-
رَاحَ, aor. يَرُوحُ, inf. n. رَوَاحٌ; and ↓ تروّح; both
signify the same; (S, Msb, K, &c.;) contr. of
غَدَا; (S;) said of a man, (TA,) and of a company
of men, (K, TA,) He, and they, went, or journeyed, or worked, or did a thing, in the evening,
(K, TA,) or in the afternoon, i. e., from the
declining of the sun from the meridian until
night: (IF, Msb, K, TA:) this is said to be the
primary meaning: (TA:) but they also mean he,
or they, returned: (Msb:) and went, or journeyed, at any time: (Msb, * TA:) [for] الرَّوَاحُ is
not, as some imagine it to be, only [the going, or
journeying,] in the last, or latter, part of the
day; but is used by the Arabs as meaning the
going, or journeying, at any time of the night or
day; as also الغُدُوُّ: so say Az and others: (Msb:)
or راح, inf. n. رَوَاحٌ, signifies he came, or went,
after the declining of the sun from the meridian:
but is sometimes used as meaning he went in an
absolute sense: (Mgh:) and thus it means in the
trad. commencing مَنْ رَاحَ إِلَى الجُمُعَةِ [mentioned above, where a different explanation of
the verb is given]: (Mgh, * Msb:) and [in like
manner] one says to his companion or companions, ↓ تَرَوَّحْ or تَرَوَّحُوا as meaning Go, or
journey: (TA:) but رَاحَتِ الإِبِلُ, (S, L, K,) aor.
تَرُوحُ and تَرَاحُ, inf. n. رَوَاحٌ (L) and رَائِحَةٌ, (AZ,
L, K,) signifies only The camels returned in the
evening, or afternoon, (S, * Msb,) when their
pastors drove or brought them back to their
owners: so says Az. (Msb.) You say, رُحْتُ
إِلَيْهِمْ and عِنْدَهُمْ, inf. n. رَوْحٌ and رَوَاحٌ, I went,
(K, TA,) and I came, (TA,) to them in the
evening, or afternoon; [or at any time, as appears
from what has been said above;] and so رُحْتُهُمْ,
(K, TA,) inf. n. رَوْحٌ; (TA;) and ↓ رَوَّحْتُهُمْ, (K,
TA,) inf. n. تَرْوِيحٌ; (TA;) and ↓ تَرَوَّحْتُهُمْ: (K,
TA:) and ↓ أَنَا أُغَادِيهِ وَ أُرَاوِحُهُ [I go, or come, to
him early in the morning, in the first part of the
day, or between the time of the prayer of daybreak and sunrise, and I go, or come, to him in
the evening, or afternoon, app. he doing the like
to me]. (A. [See also 6.]) And رَاحَتْ عَلَيْهِ إِبِلُهُ,
and غَنَمُهُ, and مَالُهُ, His camels, and his sheep or
goats, and his cattle, returned to him after the
declining of the sun from the meridian; only at
that time: and ↓ اراحت may perhaps be a dial.
var. thereof: (L, TA:) or راحت بِالعَشِىِّ عَلَى أَهْلِهَا
they (i. e. camels) returned from the place of
pasture in the evening, or afternoon, to their
owners. (S, * Msb.) ―

aor. يَزَاحُ; (S, A;) and ↓ تروّح; (S, A;) [said in
the TA to be tropical, but not so in the A;] The
trees broke forth with leaves: (S, A, K:) or the
former, the trees broke forth with leaves before
the winter, when the night became cold, without
rain; (As, TA;) and so the latter: (L:) or the
latter, the trees broke forth with leaves after the
close of the صَيْف [or summer]: (S, TA:) and
الغُصْنُ ↓ تروّح The branch put forth leaves after
other leaves had fallen from it. (R, TA.) [See
another meaning of راح الشجر near the beginning
of this art.] ―
-b7-  راح, (S, K,) aor. يَرَاحُ, inf. n.
رَاحَةٌ, (S,) said of a horse, [perhaps from the same
verb as signifying “ he was, or became, brisk,

a tree, and said of a tempestuous wind. (L.)
And رِيحَ, said of a pool of water left by a torrent,

(S, A, K.) In like manner also it is said of other
things. (TA.) One says, رِيحَتِ الشَّجَرَةُ The tree
was blown upon by the wind: or was blown about,
or shaken, by the wind, so that its leaves were
made to fall: or had the dust scattered upon it by
the wind. (L.) And رِيحُوا They (a people, or
party,) were smitten and destroyed by the wind:
(K, TA:) or they entered upon [a time of] wind;
(K;) as also, in this latter sense, ↓ أَرَاحُوا, (S, K,)
or ↓ أَرْوَحُوا. (A.) ―

the same, he smelt, or perceived, odour: (A:)
and these two, said of a stallion, he perceived the
smell of the female: and of a beast of prey you
say, الرِّيحَ ↓ أَرْوَحَ, and ↓ أَرَاحَهَا, and ↓ استراحها,
and ↓ اِسْتَرْوَحَهَا, meaning he smelt, or perceived,
the odour; and accord. to Lh, some say, رَاحَهَا;
but this is seldom used. (TA) [It is asserted
(in Har p. 324) that ↓ استراح is only from الرَّاحَةُ;
but this assertion is of no weight against the
authorities cited above.] It is said in a trad.,
مَنْ قَتَلَ نَفْسًا مُعَاهِدَةً لَمْ يَرَحٌ رَائِحَةَ الجَنَّةِ,
(A 'Obeyd, S, Mgh, * Msb, *) or لم يَرِحْ, (AA, S,

said of flesh-meat, (Lh, M, A, * Msb,) and of
water, (Lh, S, M, A, Msb,) &c.; (S;) and so the

work, by turns, [resting by turns,] or alternately;
syn. تَعَاقَبَاهُ. (K, TA.) And تراوحوا أَمْرًا They

[Hence,] إِنَّ يَدَيْهِ لَتَتَرَاوَحَانِ بِالمَعْرُوفِ (S, A *)
[in the S, the context implies that the meaning is,
Verily his two hands are occupied alternately in
doing that which is kind, or beneficent: in the A,
it is said to be tropical, and the context seems to
indicate that the meaning is, (tropical:)  his two hands vie,
one with the other, in promptness to do that

quasi-pass. of رَوَّحَ عَنْهُ or بِهِ,] said of a hired man,

The rain revived the trees. (L.)
رَاحٌ Windy; applied to a day: (TA:) or, so
applied, violently-windy; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) as
also ↓ رَائِحٌ, which is the original form, (Msb,) or
may be so: (TA:) fem. of the former with ة,
applied to a night (لَيْلَةٌ). (A, TA.) [See also
رَيِّحٌ.] One says, هٰذِهِ لَيْلَةٌ رَاحَةٌ لِلْمَكْرُوبِ فِيهَا رَاحَةٌ
[This is a windy night: the oppressed in mind
has rest therein]. (A.)
-A2-  It is also syn. with

the paragraph.]) ―
-b2-  And [hence,] Wine; (S, A, *
K;) as also ↓ رَيَاحٌ: (S, K:) so called because
the drinker thereof becomes brisk, lively, or
sprightly; or, accord. to IHsh, because he
becomes affected with briskness, liveliness, or
sprightliness, disposing him to generous actions:
in the L, [which mentions these two words in
art. ريح,] the ا in the former word is said to be
substituted for ى [and hence the ى in the latter

-b2-  I. q.
نفس [app. نَفَسٌ i. e. Breath; like رُوحٌ]: said to
be the primary signification: (MF:) or spirit;
[like رُوحٌ;] syn. نَفْسٌ; as in the saying, أَحْيَا
النَّاسَ بِرَوْحِهِ [He (meaning God) hath quickened,
or vivified, mankind with his spirit: or perhaps
the right reading is بِرُوحِهِ]. (A.) ―
-b3-  See also
رَاحَةٌ, with which it is syn. (S, K.) ―
-b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Joy,
happiness, or gladness; (AA, MF, TA;) said to
be a metaphorical meaning, from the same word
as syn. with نفس; (MF;) and ↓ رُوحٌ likewise
has this meaning: (IAar, TA:) or the former,
rest, or ease, from grief, or sorrow, of heart.
(As, TA.) In the saying of 'Alee, فَبَاشَرُوا رَوْحَ
اليَقِينِ or اليقين ↓ رُوحَ, the phrase روح اليقين is
thought by ISd to mean (assumed tropical:)  The joy and happiness
that arise from certainty. (TA. [See art. بشر.])
―
-b5-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Mercy (S, K, TA) of God; thus called
as being a cause of rest, or ease; (TA;) and so
↓ رِيحٌ; (K;) and ↓ رَيْحَانٌ; (L;) and ↓ رُوحٌ is
said by Az to have this meaning in the Kur iv.
169: the pl. of the first of these three words [and
of the last, and accord. to some a pl. of the second
also,] is أَرْوَاحٌ. (TA.)
رُوحٌ The soul, spirit, or vital principle; syn.
نَفْسٌ; (IAar, IAmb, L, Msb, TA, and S and K
&c. in art. نفس; [but there is a difference between
these two words, for they are not always interchangeable, as I have shown in art. نفس;]) [i. e.]
مَا بِهِ حَيَاةُ الأَنْفُسِ; (K; [see also رَوْحٌ, third
sentence;]) often occurring in the Kur and the
Traditions in different senses, but generally signifying [as explained above, i. e.] the vital principle;
(IAth, TA;) [or the nervous fluid; or animal
spirit;] a subtile vaporous substance, which is the
principle of vitality and of sensation and of
voluntary motion; also called the رُوح حَيَوَانِىّ;
(KT in explanation of the term نَفْسٌ;) or a subtile
body, the source of which is the hollow of the
corporeal heart, and which diffuses itself into all
the other parts of the body by means of the
pulsing veins, or arteries: (KT in explanation of
the term الرُّوحُ الحَيَوَانِىُّ: [so too نَفْسٌ; q. v.:
see also Gen. ix. 4: many of the ancients believed
the soul to reside in the blood: see Aristotle, De
Anim. i. 2, and Virgil's Æn. ix. 349:]) or the
vital principle in man: (Fr, TA:) or the breath
which a man breathes, and which pervades the
whole body: [and this seems to be the original
idea expressed by the word:] after its exit, he
ceases to breathe; and when it has completely gone
forth, his eyes remain gazing towards it until
they close; called in Pers. جَانْ: (AHeyth, TA:)
accord. to the Sunnees, the rational soul, (النَّفْسُ
النَّاطِقَةُ, [also termed الرُّوحُ الإِنْسَانِىُّ,]) which is
adapted to the faculty of making known its ideas
by means of speech, and of understanding speech,
and which perishes not with the perishing of the
body, being a substance, not an accident; as is
shown by the words in the Kur iii. 163, which
refer to the روح: (Msb:) most of the doctors of
the fundamentals of religion forbid the diving into
this matter, because God has abstained from
making it known: (TA:) the philosophers say
that it is the blood, by the exhausting of which
the life ceases: (Msb:) the word is masc., (IAar,
IAmb, Az, S, M, A, Msb, K, *) thus, with the
Arabs, differing from نَفْسٌ, for this they make
fem., (IAar, IAmb, Msb,) but the former is also
fem., (S, M, A, Msb, K,) app. as meaning نَفْسٌ,
(Msb,) as is said in the R; (TA;) and most hold
it to be as often fem. as it is masc.: (MF:) one
says خَرَجَ رُوحُهُ (IAar, Az, TA) [and also خَرَجَتْ
رُوحُهُ, meaning His soul departed, or went forth]:
the pl. is أَرْوَاحٌ. (S, Msb.) ―
-b2-  Also i. q. نَفْخٌ (K)
[properly A blowing with the mouth; but here]
meaning wind that issues from the رُوح; (TA;)
wind, or breath. (ADk, TA.) Dhu-r-Rummeh
says, respecting fire that he had struck, and upon
which he bade his companion to blow, أَحْيِهَا بِرُوحِكَ
Give life to it, or enliven it, with thy wind [or
breath]. (TA.) And one says, مَلَأَ القِرْبَةَ مِنْ
رُوحِهِ He filled the skin with his wind; with his
breath. (ADk, TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence,] الرُّوحُ also
signifies (assumed tropical:)  Inspiration, or divine revelation; (Zj,
Th, K;) such as is imparted by means of an
angel: thus in the Kur xvi. 2 and xl. 15: so
called because it quickens from the death of
infidelity, and thus is, to a man, like the رُوح
which is the vital principle of his body: (T:) or
(so says Zj accord. to the L, but in the K “ and ” )
the prophetic commission. (Zj, K.) ―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  The
Kur-án; (IAar, Zj, S, * A, * K;) whereby God's
creatures are [spiritually] quickened, and guided
to the right way. (TA.) So in the trad., تَحَايَوْا
بِذِكْرِ اللّٰهِ وَ رُوحِهِ (tropical:)  [Revive yourselves with God's
book of religion and religious laws, (or ذِكْر may
here have some other meaning,) and his Kur-án].
(TA. [Mentioned also in the A; in a copy of
which, in the place of تَحَايَوْا, I find تَحَابُوا, an
evident mistranscription.]) ―
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  What God
ordains and commands (K, TA) by means of his
assistants and angels. (TA.) ―
-b6-  Also Jibreel
[i. e. Gabriel]; (S, * A, * K;) called in the Kur
[xxvi. 193] الرُّوحُ الأَمِينُ, and [in ii. 81] رُوحُ
القُدُسِ or القُدْسِ, as related by Az on the authority of Th. (TA.) [The last of these appellations,
or generally, but incorrectly, الرُّوحُ القُدُسُ, is
applied by the Eastern Christians among the
Arabs to The Holy Spirit; the Third Person
of the Trinity.] ―
-b7-  And [sometimes Our Lord]
Jesus. (S, * A, * K.) ―
-b8-  And A certain angel,
(I'Ab, K,) in the Seventh Heaven, (I'Ab, TA,)
whose face is like that of a man, and his body
like that of the [other] angels: (I'Ab, K:) or
certain creatures resembling mankind, but not
men: so in the Kur lxxviii. 38: (Zj:) or the
watchers over the angels who are watchers over
the sons of Adam, whose faces are said to be like
the faces of men, and whom the other angels see
not, like as we see not the watchers nor the [other]
angels. (Th.) ―
-b9-  See also رَوْحٌ, in three places.
-A2-
Also pl. of رَؤُوحٌ: (L:) ―
-b2-  and of أَرْوَحُ. (S &c.)
رَوَحٌ: see رَائِحٌ, of which it is said to be a
quasi-pl. n., in three places.
-A2-  Also Width, wideness, or ampleness. (S, K.) El-Mutanakhkhil
[in the TA El-Muntakhal] El-Hudhalee says,
لٰكِنْ كَبِيرُ بْنُ هِنْدٍ يَوْمَ ذٰلِكُمُ
فُتْخُ الشَّمَائِلِ فِى أَيْمَانِهِمْ رَوَحُ
(S, TA,) meaning But Kebeer Ibn-Hind, a tribe
of Hudheyl, on that day, were lax in the joints
of the left hands by reason of vehement pulling
[of the bows], having wideness in their right
hands by reason of vehement striking with the
sword. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And [particularly] Width, or
wideness, in the space between the thighs: (TA:)
or width, or wideness, (S, Mgh, K,) in, (S, K,)
or of, (Mgh,) [or between,] the two legs, (S,
Mgh, K,) less than what is termed فَحَجٌ, (S, K,)
or less than فَجَجٌ, (A, Mgh,) with wideness between the fore parts of the feet, and nearness of
the heels, each to the other: (S:) or [simply]
wideness between the fore parts of the feet, and
nearness of the heels, each to the other: (Msb:)
or a spreading in the fore part of each foot:
(Lth, Mgh, Msb:) or a turning over of the foot
upon its outer side: IAar says that رَوَحٌ in the
legs is less than فَدَعٌ, and this is less than عَقَلٌ.
(TA.)
-A3-  هٰذَا الأَمْرُ بَيْنَنَا رَوَحٌ means This is a
thing, or an affair, which we do by turns; as
also عَوَرٌ. (TA.)
رِيحٌ originally رِوْحٌ, the و being changed into
ى because of the preceding kesreh, (T, S, Msb,)
as is shown by its dim. mentioned below; (T,
Msb;) Sb held it to be of the measure فِعْلٌ; and
Abu-l-Hasan, فِعْلٌ and فُعْلٌ; [if the latter, originally رُيْحٌ;] (TA;) [Wind; i. e.] the air that is
made to obey [the will of God] and to run its
course between heaven and earth: (Msb, TA:) or
the breath (نَسِيم) of the air; and in like manner, of anything: (L, TA:) said to be thus
called because it generally brings رَوْح and رَاحَة
[i. e. rest, or ease]: (IAmb, MF:) one says
رِيحٌ and ↓ رِيحَةٌ, like دَارٌ and دَارَةٌ; (S;) [using
the latter as a more special term; for] رِيحَةٌ signifies a portion of wind (طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ رِيحٍ) [meaning
a wind of short duration; or a breath, puff,
blast, or gust, of wind]; (Sb, M;) but رِيحٌ and
↓ رِيحَةٌ may be used in the same sense; i. e. the
latter may be used as syn. with the former, and
they are mentioned by some [as analogous] with
كَوْكَبٌ and كَوْكَبَةٌ: (Sb, L:) رِيْح is of the
fem. gender (IAmb, L, Msb) in most cases;
(Msb;) and all the other names for wind are fem.
except إِعْصَارٌ, which is masc.; (IAmb, Msb;)
but ريح is sometimes made masc. as meaning
هَوَآءٌ: (AZ, Msb:) [it is used by physicians as
signifying flatus, flatuosity, or flatulence; as in
the phrase رِيحٌ غَلِيظَةٌ a gross flatus:] the pl. [of
pauc.] is أَرْوَاحٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.) and أَرْيَاحٌ,
(S, Msb, K,) the latter used by some, but disallowed by AHát because there is in it no kesreh
to cause the و to be changed into ى, (L, Msb,)
and [the pl. of mult. is] رِيَاحٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,
&c.,) with ى because of the kesreh, (Msb,) and
رِيَحٌ; (K, but not found by SM in any other
lexicon;) and the pl. pl. is أَرَاوِيحُ [pl. of أَرْوَاحٌ]
and أَرَايِيحُ [pl. of أَرْيَاحٌ]: (K:) the dim. of رِيحٌ is
↓ رُوَيْحَةٌ. (T, Msb.) رِيَاحٌ, or another form of pl.,
is often used in a good sense; and the sing., in an
evil sense; because the Arabs say that the clouds
are not made to give rain save by diverse winds
blowing together; and this distinction is observed
in the Kur-án. (L.) Hence, it is related in a
trad., that he [Mohammad] used to say, when
wind rose, اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْهَا رِيَاحًا وَ لَا تَجْعَلْهَا رِيحًا [O
God, make it to be winds, and made it not to be
a wind]. (TA.) [But this distinction is not
always observed.] One says, فُلَانٌ يَمِيلُ مَعَ كُلِّ
رِيحٍ (tropical:)  [Such a one inclines, or turns, with every
wind]. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ كَالرِّيحِ المُرْسَلَةِ [Such
a one is like the wind that is sent forth to drive
the clouds, and produce rain; (see the Kur xxv.
50;)] meaning, (tropical:)  quick, or prompt, to do acts of
kindness, or beneficence. (A.) And رَجُلٌ سَاكِنُ
الرِّيحِ (tropical:)  A man who is calm, sedate, staid, or
grave. (A.) ―
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Predominance, or prevalence; and power, or force. (S, K.) A poet
says, (S,) namely, Suleyk Ibn-Es-Sulakeh, or
Taäbbata-Sharrà, or Aashà of the tribe of Fahm,
(TA, and so in one of my copies of the S,)
أَتَنْظُرَانِ قَلِيلًا رَيْثَ غَفْلَتِهِمْ
أَوْ تَعْدُوَانِ فَإِنَّ الرِّيحَ لِلْعَادِى
(assumed tropical:)  [Will ye two await, a little, the time of their
inadvertence, or will ye act aggressively? for
prevalence is for the aggressor]. (S.) And
hence the phrase in the Kur [viii. 48], وَ تَذْهَبَ
رِيحُكُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [And your predominance, or power,
depart]: (S:) [or in this latter instance it has
the meaning next following.] ―
-b3-  (tropical:)  Aid against an
enemy; or victory, or conquest: (K, TA:) and
(tropical:)  a turn of good fortune. (A, K, TA.) One
says, ذَهَبَتْ رِيحُهُمْ (tropical:)  Their turn of good fortune
departed. (A.) And إِذَا هَبَّتْ رِيَاحُكَ فَاغْتَنِمْهَا
(tropical:)  [When thy turns of good fortune come, avail
thyself of them]. (A.) And الرِّيحُ لِآلِ فُلَانٍ
(tropical:)  Aid against the enemy, or victory or conquest,
or the turn of good fortune, is to the family of
such a one. (TA.) ―
-b4-  See also رَوْحٌ. ―
-b5-  And see
رَائِحَةٌ (with which it is syn.), in four places. ―
-b6-
Also (assumed tropical:)  A good, sweet, or pleasant, thing. (K.)
―
-b7-  The pl. أَرْوَاحٌ occurs in a trad. as meaning
(tropical:)  The jinn, or genii; because they are [supposed
to be often] invisible, like the wind. (TA.)
رَاحَةٌ Rest, repose, or ease; contr. of تَعَبٌ;
(TA;) cessation of trouble, or inconvenience, and
of toil, or fatigue; (Msb;) [or freedom therefrom;] and ↓ رَوْحٌ signifies the same as رَاحَةٌ,
(S, A, K,) from الاِسْتِرَاحَةُ; (S, A;) like ↓ رَوَاحٌ
[mentioned in the first paragraph as an inf. n. in
a similar sense, as are also رَاحَةٌ and ↓ رَوْحَةٌ and
↓ رَوَاحَةٌ and ↓ رَوِيحَةٌ, i. e., as meaning the experiencing relief from grief &c.]. (TA.) You
say, ↓ مَا لِفُلَانٍ فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ مِنْ رَوَاحٍ i. e. رَاحَةٍ
[There is not, for such a one, in this affair, or
case, or event, any rest, &c.]. (TA.) And اِفْعَلْ
↓ ذٰلِكَ فِى سَرَاحٍ وَ رَوَاحٍ (tropical:)  Do thou that in a state
of ease (S, A, K) and rest. (A.) ―
-b2-  See also 4,
near the middle of the paragraph.
-A2-  (assumed tropical:)  A wife;
syn. عِرْسٌ: (K:) because one trusts to her, or
relies upon her, and becomes quiet, or easy, in
mind. (TA.)
-A3-  The hand; syn. كَفٌّ: (S, K:)
or [rather] the palm of the hand; (Msb, MF;)
for the term كَفّ includes the راحة with the
fingers: (MF:) pl. ↓ رَاحٌ, (S, A, * Msb, K, *) [or
rather this, said in the K to be syn. with رَاحَاتٌ,
is a coll. gen. n., of which رَاحَةٌ is the n. un.,] and
[the pl. is] رَاحَاتٌ. (Msb, K.) You say, دَفَعُوهُ
↓ بِالرَّاحِ [They pushed him with the palms of the
hands]. (A.) The saying of a poet,
↓ إِذَا دَلَكَتْ شَمْسُ النَّهَارِ بِرَاحِ
is explained as meaning When the sun of day has
set, and men, looking towards it, shield themselves from its rays with the palms of their hands:
or, accord. to IAar, when the [sun of] day has
become dark, by reason of the dust of battle, and
it is as though it were setting, and people have
found rest from its heat. (L. [See also بَرَاحٌ,
in art. برح; where other readings are mentioned.])
―
-b2-  [Hence, app., as seems to be indicated in the
TA,] رَاحَةُ الكَلْبِ (tropical:)  A certain plant. (K, TA.)

تَرَكْتُهُ أَنْقَى مِنَ الرَّاحَةِ (K, TA) i. e. I left him,
or it, more clear than the court, open area, or
yard, [of a house,] or than the palm of the hand;
(TA;) meaning, (assumed tropical:)  without anything. (K, TA.)
―
-b5-  And ↓ رَاحٌ signifies also Plain and open
tracts of land, producing much herbage, (ISh,
K,) hard, but comprising soft places and [what
are termed] جَرَاثِيم [pl. of جُرْثُومَةٌ, q. v.], not
forming any part of [the bed of] a torrent nor
of a valley; (ISh;) one whereof is termed رَاحَةٌ.
(ISh, K.) ―
-b6-  Also The plicature of a garment, or
piece of cloth: (K, TA:) or the original plicature
thereof: so in the saying, in a trad., respecting a

[Fold thou it in the manner of its original plicature]. (TA.)

رَيْحَانٌ a word respecting the formation of

that its medial radical letter is و, and its original
form رَيْوَحَانٌ, as may be argued from the form of
its dim., mentioned below; (Msb;) others, that
its original form is رَوْيَحَانٌ; (MF;) and others,
that its medial radical letter is ى, and that it is
of the same measure as شَيْطَانٌ, as may be argued
from the form of its pl., mentioned below; (Msb;)
A certain plant, (S, K,) well known, (S,) of
sweet odour; (K;) the شَاهَسْفَرَم [or شَاهِسْفَرَم, i. e.

follows.
رُوحَانِىٌّ, with damm to the ر, (S, A, K, &c.,)
and ↓ رَوْحَانِىٌّ, with fet-h, but this latter is deemed
strange by the lexicologists [as syn. with the
former], (MF,) app. rel. ns., from رَوحٌ [in the
former instance], or from رَوْحٌ meaning the
“ breath of the wind when weak ” [in the latter
instance], extraordinary in form, with ا and ن
added to the usual form of the rel. n.: (TA:)
Of, or relating to, the angels and the jinn or
genii: (S, A, * K:) in this sense Abu-l-Khattáb
asserts himself to have heard the former used:
(S:) accord. to AO, it is applied by the Arabs to
anything having in it a soul, or spirit, (Sb, S,)
whether a human being or a beast: (Sb:) or it
has this signification also: (K:) accord. to Wardán Aboo-Khálid, as related by ISh, among the
angles are those who are termed رُوحَانِيُّونَ, and
those who are created of light; and of the former
are Jibreel and Meekáeel and Isráfeel: and ISh
adds that the روحانيّون are souls, or spirits, which
have not bodies; [spiritual beings;] and that the
term روحانىّ is not applied to anything save what
is of this description, such as the angles and the
jinn and the like: and this is the correct explanation; not that of Ibn-El-Mudhaffar, that it signifies that into which, a soul, or spirit, has been
blown. (T, TA.)

(L:) ↓ رَوَحٌ is pl., (S, K,) or [rather] a quasi-pl.
n., (L,) of رَائِحٌ, (S, L, K,) like as خَدَمٌ is of
خَادِمٌ. (S, L.) قَوْمُكَ رَائِحٌ [Thy people, or party,
are, or is, going, &c.] is a phrase of the Arabs
mentioned by Lh on the authority of Ks; but he
says that it is only used thus, with a determinate
noun; i. e., that one does not say قَوْمٌ رَائِحٌ [though
this is agreeable with analogy, as well as قَوْمٌ
رَائِحَةٌ and قَوْمٌ رَائِحُونَ]: one says also ↓ قَوْمٌ رَوَحٌ
and رُوحٌ. (L, TA.) And one says إِبِلٌ رَائِحَةٌ

from pasture. (Msb.) [Hence,] مَا لَهُ سَارِحَةٌ وَ لَا
رَائِحَةٌ [lit. He has not any camels, &c., that go
away to pasture, nor any that return from pasture], meaning (assumed tropical:)  he has not anything: (S:) and
sometimes it means (assumed tropical:)  he has not any people, or

رَائِحَةٍ زَوْجًا occurs in a trad. as meaning He gave

from pasture, a portion, or sort: and in another,
مَالٌ رَائِحٌ, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Property, or cattle,]
of which the profit and recompense return to one:
or in each, as some relate it, the word is with ب
[i. e. رَابِحَة and رَابِح]. (TA.) ↓ طَيْرٌ رَوَحٌ means
Birds in a state of dispersion: or returning in
the evening, or afternoon, (S, K,) to their places,
(S,) or to their nests: (K:) or, accord. to the T,
رَوَحٌ in this case is for رَوَحَةٌ, [a pl. of رَائِحٌ,] like
كَفَرَةٌ and فَجَرَةٌ, [pls. of كَافِرٌ and فَاجِرٌ,] and
means, in this instance, in a state of dispersion.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, [used as a subst., or an epithet in

عَلَى سَرَاةِ رَائِحٍ مَمْطُورِ
i. e. [I put my plaited thongs, and the curved
pieces of wood, or the cover, of the camel's saddle,
upon the back of (a camel like)] a wild bull

بَلْ خِلْتُ أَعْلَاقِى وَ جُِلْبَ كُورِ
[Nay, or nay rather, I fancied my bags for
travelling-provisions &c. that were hung upon
my camel, and the curved pieces of wood of my
camel's saddle]. (IB, TA in art. جلب. [اعلاقى
is there explained as meaning “ my things that I
held in high estimation: ” but the rendering that
I have given I consider preferable.])
رَائِحَةٌ [fem. of رَائِحٌ, used as a subst.,] and ↓ رِيحٌ
both signify the same; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) i. e.
An accidental property or quality that is perceived by the sense of smelling; [or rather an
exhalation that is so perceived; meaning odour,
scent, or smell;] (Mgh, Msb;) syn. نَسِيمٌ; whether
sweet or stinking: (K:) and the former, a sweet
odour which one perceives in the نَسِيم [or breath
of the wind]: (L:) ↓ the latter is fem. [like the
former]: (Msb:) the pl. of the former is رَوَائِحُ;
and El-Hulwánee mentions أَرَايِيحُ as pl. of أَرْيَاحٌ
[which is pl. of ↓ رِيحٌ, under which see its other
pls.]. (Mgh.) You say, الشَّىْءِ ↓ وَجَدْتُ رِيحَ
and رَائِحَتَهُ in the same sense [i. e. I perceived
the odour of the thing]. (S.) And لِهٰذِهِ البَقْلَةِ
رَائِحَةٌ طَيِّبَةٌ [This herb, or leguminous plant, has
a sweet odour]. (L.) ―
-b2-  It is said in the K, that
مَا فِى وَجْهِهِ رَائِحَةٌ means (tropical:)  There is not in his
face any blood: but [SM says that] this requires
consideration; for, accord. to A'Obeyd, one says,
أَتَانَا فُلَانٌ وَ مَا فِى وَجْهِهِ رَائِحَةُ دَمٍ مِنْ الفَرَقِ
(tropical:)  [Such a one came to us not having in his face
any tinge of blood by reason of fright, or fear]:
and accord. to the A [and the Mgh], one says of
a person who has come in fright, or fear, أَتَانَا
وَ مَا فِى رَجْهِهِ رَائِحَةُ دَمٍ: (TA:) [accord. to Mtr,
however,] one sometimes says, وَ مَا فِى وَجْهِهِ رَائِحَةٌ,
without adding دم; and an instance of this occurs
in a trad. of Aboo-Jahl. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  رَائِحَةٌ also
signifies A rain of the evening or afternoon:
(Lh, K:) or, as Lh says on one occasion, [simply] rain: (TA:) pl. رَوَائِحُ. (Lh, K.) ―

قَدَمٌ رَوْحَآءُ, meaning A foot spreading in its fore
part: (Lth, Mgh, TA:) or turning over upon its
outer side. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, and ↓ أَرْيَحُ, (K,) or
the latter only is correct in this case, (TA,) Wide;
applied to a مَحْمِل [q. v.]: (K, TA:) and so the
latter applied to anything: (Lth, TA:) so too
the former applied to a [bowl such as is termed]
قَدَح: and the same also signifies shallow; applied
to a vessel: (TA:) and so رَوْحَآءُ; applied to a
[bowl such as is termed] قَصْعَة. (S, A, K.)
أَرْيَحُ: see the next preceding paragraph.

K, TA;) characterized by alacrity, cheerfulness,
briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness, disposing him

beneficence: (S, * A, L, K: *) the former ى is said
by AAF to be substituted for و: (TA. Mentioned
in the L in the present art. and in art. ريح.) The
Arabs have many epithets like this, [as أَجْوَلِىٌّ
and أَحْوَذِىٌّ and أَحْوَزِىٌّ and أَلْمَعِىٌّ,] of the meansure أَفْعَلِىٌّ, as though they were rel. ns. (TA.)
―
-b2-  It is also an epithet applied to a sword, meaning (assumed tropical:)  That shakes, (TA, and Ham p. 358,) as
though brisk, or prompt, to strike: (Ham:) or
meaning of Aryah, a town of Syria, (TA and
Ham, [in the latter of which the phrase سُيُوفَ
أَرْيَحَ is cited in confirmation from a poem of Sakhr
el-Ghei,]) or a tribe of El-Yemen. (TA.)
أَرْيَحِيَّةٌ (tropical:)  Largeness, or liberality, of disposition;
(S, K, TA;) alacrity, cheerfulness, briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness, disposing one to promptness
in acts of liberality, kindness, or beneficence:
(S, * A, L, K: *) the former ى is said by AAF to
be substituted for و: (TA:) ↓ تَرَيُّحٌ, accord. to Lh,
signifies the same, and ISd thinks it to be an inf. n.,
of which the verb is تَرَيَّحَ. (L: in which these two
ns. are mentioned in the present art. and in art.
ريح. [See also رَاحٌ: and see 1.]) You say,
أَخَذَتْهُ الأَرْيَحِيَّةُ, (S, L, K,) or أَرْيَحِيَّةٌ إِلَى النَّدَى,

[I performed with them the prayer of the تراويح].
