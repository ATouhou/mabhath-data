روغ1
رَاغَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor. يَرُوغُ, (S, Msb,) inf. n.
رَوْغٌ (S, Msb, K) and رَوَغَانٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,)
said of a fox, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and of a man,
(K,) He turned aside or away from a thing:
(K:) or went this way and that, (Mgh,) or to
the right and left, quickly, (Msb,) and deceitfully,
or guilefully: (Mgh, Msb:) [or turned aside to
deceive him who was behind him: for] the primary signification of رَوْغٌ is the turning aside to
deceive him who is behind one. (Er-Rághib, TA.)
It is said in a prov.,
رُوغِى جَعَارِ وَ انْظُرِى أَيْنَ المَفِرْ
[for المَفِرُّ, i. e. Turn aside or away, or go this
way and that, &c., O she-hyena, and look where
is the place to which to flee: or, as some relate it,
the first word is رُوعِى: see art. جعر]. (S, TA.
[Freytag seems to have found المعز for المفر; and
has explained رُوغِى جَعَارِ as meaning “ Vide ubi
capræ sint, hyæna! ”]) And you say, راغ الصَّيْدُ
The game, or object of the chase, went away this
way and that, or hither and thither. (TA.
[There said to be tropical; but I see not wherefore.]) And one says, راغ عَنْ فُلَانٍ He turned
aside, or away, from such a one [and particularly
with deceit or guile; eluded him; dodged him].
(JK.) And هُوَ يَرُوغُ عَنِ الحَقِّ [He deviates from
the truth, or from that which is right or just].
(TA.) And راغ الطَّرِيقُ The road turned aside or
away, or deviated. (Msb.) And راغ مِنْ كَذَا
He turned away from such a thing, and returned,
concealing his return: (Har p. 21:) [for,] accord.
to Fr, راغ is not said of one who has returned
unless he concealed his return. (Har ibid., and
TA.) And راغ إِلَى كَذَا, (S, Msb,) or الى فُلَانٍ,
(TA,) He turned aside (S, Msb, TA) to such a
thing, (S, Msb,) or to such a one, (TA,) secretly.
(S, Msb, TA.) Hence, in the Kur [li. 26], فَراغَ
إِلَى أَهْلِهِ فَجَآءَ بِعِجْلٍ سَمِينٍ And he turned aside,
(Jel, TA,) or went away, (Bd,) to his family
secretly [and brought a fat calf]: (Bd, Jel, TA:)
or he returned to his family concealing his return.
(Fr, TA.) And in the Kur [xxxvii. 91], فَرَاغَ
عَلَيْهِمْ ضَرْبًا بِالْيَمِينِ And he turned against them
(Fr, S, Bd, TA) secretly, (Bd, TA,) smiting them
with the right hand, or because of the oath that
he had sworn; (Bd;) as though the رَوْغ in this
case consisted in his employing a pretext against
them in order that he might do to their gods what
he did: (S, L:) or the meaning is, he advanced
against them. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  راغ حَاجَةً إِلَى فُلَانٍ,
aor. as above, He sought to obtain quickly an
object of want of such a one. (JK, TA. [See

K, TA,) or a morsel, or mouthful, (TA,) with
grease, or gravy, or dripping; (IAar, K, TA;)
as also مَرَّغَ, and سَغْبَلَ, and رَوَّلَ: (TA:) or you
say, رَوَّغْتُ اللُّقْمَةَ بِالسَّمْنِ, inf. n. as above, I
smeared, seasoned, imbued, or soaked, the morsel,
or mouthful, with clarified butter; as also رَيَّغْتُ:

towards him; (MA, TA;) or strove, endeavoured, or desired, to deceive, delude, beguile,
circumvent, or outwit, him; syn. خَادَعَهُ; as also
↓ اراغهُ, inf. n. إِرَاغَةٌ: and both signify he endeavoured to turn him; or endeavoured to turn him
by blandishment, or by deceitful arts, or to entice
him to turn; syn. رَاوَدَهُ. (TA.) It is said when
its object is a person who has turned away from,
or shunned, or avoided, that which one has
devised, planned, or plotted, against him. (TA.)
You say, فُلَانٌ يُرَاوِغُ فِى الأَمْرِ [Such a one
practises deceit, &c., in the affair], inf. n. مُرَاوَغَةٌ.
(S.) And مَا زِلْتُ أُرَاوِغُهُ عَنْ كَذَا I ceased not to
endeavour to turn him, or to entice him to turn,
from such a thing, syn. أُرَاوِدُهُ; (TA in this art;)
and عَلَيْهِ to it: (TA in art. منع:) and [in like
manner] you say, عَلَى أَمْرٍ ↓ فُلَانٌ يُرِيغُنِى Such a
one endeavours to turn me, or to entice me to
turn, to a thing; and عَنْ أَمْرٍ from a thing; syn.
يُرَاوِدُنِى; and seeks, or demands, my doing so.

[أَرِيغُونِى إِرَاغَتَكُمْ is expl. in one of my two copies
of the S by the words اُطْلُبُونِى طَلِبَتَكُمْ: in the
other of those copies, the latter of these words is
written طلِبتَكم: I think that the right reading is
طِلْبَتَكُمْ; and the meaning, Seek ye me with, or
in, your mode, or manner, of seeking: the proper
meaning is seek ye me with your seeking.] Khálid
Ibn-Jaafar Ibn-Kiláb says, speaking of his mare
حِذْقَة,
أَرِيغُونِى إِرَاغَتَكُمْ فَإِنِّى
وَ حِذْقَةَ كَالشَّجَا تَحْتَ الوَرِيدِ
[Seek ye me with your seeking; but ye will not

like the bone sticking fast in the throat beneath
the carotid artery]. (TA.) And you say, أَرَغْتُ
