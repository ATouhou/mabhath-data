رَغَا, (S, Mgh, K,) aor. يَرْغُو, (S,) said of a

ostrich; (K;) or رَغَتْ, aor. تَرْغُو, said of a she-camel; (JK, Msb;) inf. n. رُغَآءٌ, (JK, S, Mgh,
Msb, * K,) with which ↓ رَاغِيَةٌ is syn. [either as an

or uttered a grumbling cry; syn. ضَجَّ; (S;) or
uttered a cry, (Mgh, K,) and grumbled; syn.
صَوَّتَ فَضَجَّ: (K:) or she uttered a cry [&c.]:
(Msb:) so camels are wont to do when the loads
are lifted upon them; and youthful camels do so
much: (TA:) رُغَآءٌ signifies the cry or crying [or
grumbling, which is a kind of gurgling growl,]
(S, Msb) of the camel [when he is being laden,
and on some other occasions of discontent], (Msb,)
or of animals having the kind of foot called خُفّ:
(S:) also of the bird called رَغَّآءٌ [&c.]. (TA.)
It is said in a prov., كَفَى بِرُغَائِهَا مُنَادِيًا [Her
grumbling cry suffices as a caller] i. e., the رُغَآء of
his camel serves instead of his calling in presenting himself for entertainment as a guest: (S:)
A'Obeyd says that it is well known to the Arabs
as relating to the accomplishment of an object of
want before the asking for it: and it is applied
also to the case of a man whose aid is wanted
and who does not come to thee; excusing himself
by saying that he did not know: and to the case
of one who stands at a man's door, and to whom
it is said, “Send him who shall ask permission
for thee [to go in]; ” whereupon he replies, “His
knowledge of my standing at his door suffices for
asking permission for me: if he pleased, he would
grant me permission. ” (Meyd. [See also Freytag's Arab. Prov. ii. 328—9.]) And in another
prov., البَكْرِ ↓ كَانَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَرَاغِيَةِ, (JK, Meyd,)
or السَّقْبِ, [i. e. There befell them the like of the
grumbling cry of the young camel,] meaning, the
رُغَآء of the young camel of Thamood [which preceded the destruction of those who heard it]: the
prov. relates to the auguring evil from a thing.

El-Fak'asee says,
وَمَا يُرْغَى لِشَدَّادٍ فَصِيلُ
[And a young camel belonging to the family of
Sheddád is not made to utter its grumbling cry
for the want of its mother]; meaning that they
are niggardly; that they will not separate the
young camel from its mother by slaughter nor by
gift. (S.) And it is said in a prov.,
أَرْغُوا لَهَا حُوَارَهَا تَقِرُّ
[Make ye her (the camel's) young one to utter
its grumbling cry, then she will be quiet]: for the
she-camel when she hears the رُغَآء of her young
one becomes still: (Meyd:) the prov. means,
give him that which he wants, [then] he will be
quiet. (JK, Meyd. [See also Freytag's Arab.
Prov. i. 532.]) أَرْغَوْا لِلرَّحِيلِ means They made

being wont to do so when the loads are lifted
upon them. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, ارغاهُ (assumed tropical:)  He subdued,

هِىَ مَلِيكَةُ الإِرْغَآءِ (assumed tropical:)  She is the slave (مَلِيكَة meaning
مَمْلُوكَة) of noise and loquacity, so that she distresses the hearers: or it may mean [she is subject

[See رَغَّآءٌ.]) ―
-b4-  You say also, مَا أَثْغَى وَلَا أَرْغَى

ارتغى He drank رَغْوَة, i. e. froth: (S, Msb:)
or ارتغى رَغْوَةً he took, and sipped, or supped,
froth. (K.) It is said in a prov., يُسِرُّ حَسْوًا فِى
ارْتِغَآءٍ [He conceals a sipping, or supping, in
drinking froth]: applied to him who pretends one
thing when he means, or desires, another: (S:)
accord. to AZ and As, it originated from a man's
having some milk brought to him, and his pretending that he desired the froth, and, while
drinking this, taking of the milk; and is applied
to a man who pretends to aid thee, and benefits
himself: (Meyd:) Esh-Shaabee, to one who asked
him respecting a man who kissed his wife's

wife has become unlawful to him. ” (S.)
