رَدِفَهُ, (T, S, O, Msb, K &c.,) aor.
رَدَفَ, (K,)
inf. n. رَدْفٌ, (MA, KL,) He rode behind him [on
the same beast]; (AZ, Sh, Zj, T, MA, Msb;) [and]
so رَدَفَهُ, [aor.
رَدُفَ;] (M;) and ↓ اردفهُ; (AZ, Sh, T,
M;) said by IAar to signify the same as رَدِفَهُ:
(T:) [or, in other words,] رَدِفَهُ signifies he became
to him a رِدْف [meaning a رَدِيف]; and so رَدِفَ لَهُ;
for the Arabs often add the ل with a trans. v.
that governs an accus. noun; so that they say,
سَمِعَ لَهُ and شَكَرَ لَهُ and نَصَحَ لَهُ, meaning سَمِعَهُ
and شَكَرَهُ and نَصَحَهُ: (Fr, T:) [and also] he, or
it, followed, or came after, him, or it; (S, O, K,
and Ham p. 148;) and so رَدِفَ لَهُ; (Ham ibid.;)
and رَدَفَهُ, aor.
رَدُفَ; (K;) and ↓ اردفهُ; (S, K, and
Ham ubi suprà;) and ↓ ارتدفهُ also signifies the
same as رَدِفَهُ; (K;) رَدِفَهُ and ↓ اردفهُ being like
تَبِعَهُ and أَتْبَعَهُ in [form and] meaning: (S:)
[↓ رَدَّفَهُ, likewise, appears to be syn. with رَدِفَهُ;
or, probably, رُدِّفَهُ, which seems to signify lit. he
was made to ride behind him; &c.; for it is said
that] the inf. n. تَرْدِيفٌ signifies the coming, or
going, behind; as also تَرْدَافٌ: (KL:) and رَدِفْتُهُ
also signifies I overtook him and outwent him.
(Msb: [explained in my copy by لحقته وسبقته:
but I think that سبقته is a mistranscription for
تَبِعْتُهُ; and that the meaning therefore is, I overtook him and followed him.]) One says, كَانَ نَزَلَ
بِهِمْ أَمْرٌ فَرَدِفَ لَهُمْ آخَرُ أَعْظَمُ مِنْهُ [An event had
befallen them, and another, of greater magnitude
than it, happened afterwards to them]. (Lth, *
T, * S, O.) And أَمْرٌ ↓ اردفهُ is a dial. var. of رَدِفَهُ,
meaning An event happened to him afterwards:
(S, O:) or رَدِفَهُمُ الأَمْرُ and ↓ أَرْدَفَهُم signify the
event came upon them suddenly, or unexpectedly;
or came upon them so as to overwhelm them.
(M.) It is said in the Kur [xxvii. 74], عَسَى أَنْ
يَكُونَ رَدِفَ لَكُمْ بَعْضُ الَّذِى تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ, meaning
[Perhaps a portion of that which ye desire to
hasten] may have drawn near to you; (Yoo, Fr,
T, O,) as though the ل were introduced because
the meaning is دَنَا لَكُمْ: or it may mean يَكُونَ
رَدِفَكُمْ [may have become close behind you]; (Fr,
T, O;) the ل being introduced for a reason mentioned above, as in سَمِعَ لَهُ &c. for سَمِعَهُ &c.:
(Fr, T:) El-Aaraj read رَدَفَ لكم. (O.) And
Khuzeymeh Ibn-Málik Ibn-Nahd says,
الثُّرَيَّا ↓ إِذَا الجَوْزَآءُ أَرْدَفَتِ
ظَنَنْتُ بِآلِ فَاطِمَةَ الظُّنُونَا
[When Orion, or Gemini, shall ride behind, or
closely follow, the Pleiades, (an event which will
never occur,) I will form in my mind, respecting
the family (meaning the father) of Fátimeh, opinions]: (S, O:) cited by Fr [and by J] as an ex.
of اردفت in the sense of رَدِفَت: (T:) he means
Fátimeh the daughter of Yedhkur Ibn-'Anazeh,
who [i. e. Yedhkur] was one of the قَارِظَان. (S,
O. [Respecting the قارظان, see art. قَرظ.])

هَذِهِ دَابَّةٌ لَا تُرَادِفُ (T, S, M, O, K) and ↓ لَا تُرْدِفُ,
(Lth, M, O, K,) but the latter is rare, (K,) or
post-classical, of the language of the people of
towns and villages, (T, O,) and not allowable,
(T,) This beast will not allow a رَدِيف (Lth, T, M)
to ride it; (Lth, T;) will not bear a رديف. (S,
O, K.) ―
-b2-  مُرَادَفَةُ الجَرَادِ signifies The mounting
of [locusts one behind, or upon, another;] the

[a phrase meaning The acting as a رِدْف, or as
أَرْدَاف, to the kings,] from الرِّدَافَةُ [q. v.]. (O, K.)
Jereer, who was of the Benoo-Yarbooa, to whom
pertained the رِدَافَة in the Time of Ignorance, says,
رَبَعْنَا وَرَادَفْنَا المُلُوكَ فَظَلِّلُوا
وطَابَ الأَحَالِيبِ الثُّمَامَ المُنَزَّعَا
[We have taken the fourth part of the spoils, and
we have acted as أَرْدَاف to the kings; therefore
shade ye the skins of the camel-loads of milk collected from the camels in the pasture with panic
grass plucked up, and so make it cool for us]:
(S, * O:) وِطَاب is the pl. of the وَطْب of milk.
(S.) ―
-b4-  [In the conventional language of lexicology, رادفهُ, inf. n. مُرَادَفَةٌ, signifies It was
synonymous with it; i. e. a word with another
word: as though the former supplied the place of
the latter, like as the رِدْف supplied the place of
the king. See also 6.]

another: and in like manner one says of anything

O, K,) in the Time of Ignorance: (S: [see

them and that they should abstain from waging

lexicology, A synonym of a word or expression.
(Mz, 27th نوع.) [See 3, last signification: and
see also مُتَرَادِفُ.]
مُرْتَدِفٌ: see رَدِيفٌ, first sentence.
مُتَرَادِفٌ, as a conventional term in lexicology,
Synonymous: you say أَلْفَاظٌ مُتَرَادِفَةٌ synonymous
words or expressions. (Mz, 27th نوع.) [Loosely
explained in the K by the words أَنْ يَكُونَ اسْمًا
لِشّىْءٍ وَاحِدٍ, meaning significant of one thing;
which is the contr. of مُشْتَرَكٌ, i. e. “ homonymous: ” and in like manner, المُتَرَادِفَةُ is expl.
in the O, ان تكون أَسْمَآءً لشىءٍ واحدٍ; and is said
to be post-classical.] مُتَرَادِفَاتٌ [its pl. when used
as a subst.] signifies Synonyms; i. e. single, or
simple, words denoting the same thing considered
in one and the same respect or light: thus the
مُتَرَادِفَانِ differ from the noun and the definition
[thereof], because these [generally] are not both
single words; and from the مُتَبَايِنَانِ [or “ two
disparates ”] such as السَّيْفُ and الصَّارِمُ, because
these denote the same thing considered in two different respects, the one in respect of the substance,
and the other in respect of the quality: (Fakhred-Deen [Er-Rázee] in the Mz, 27th نوع:) or
they may be two simple words, as اللَّيْثُ and الأَسَدُ;
and two compound expressions, as, جُلُوسُ اللَّيْثِ
and قُعُودُ الأَسَدِ; and a single word and a compound
expression, as المُزُّ and الحُلْوُ الحَامِضُ. (Kull
p. 130.) [See also مُرَادِفُ لَفْظٍ.]
[This art. is wanting in the copies of the L and
TA to which I have had access.]
