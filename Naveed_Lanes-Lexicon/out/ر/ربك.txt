to be Ibn-Lisán-el-Hommarah, (TA,) came to
his family, or wife, (S, K,) from a journey, (TA,)
and was congratulated with the annunciation that
a boy was born to him: whereupon he said,
“ What shall I do with him? Shall I eat him
or shall I drink him? ” so his wife said, غَرْثَانُ
فَارْبُكُوا لَهُ: and when he was satiated, he said,
“ How are the infant and his mother? ” (S, K:)
the saying means, “he is hungry, therefore prepare ye for him food, that his hunger may be
allayed, and then congratulate him with the annunciation of the birth of the child: ” and IDrd
says that it is applied to the case of him whose
anxiety has departed and who has become unoccupied so that he may attend to other things. (TA.)
