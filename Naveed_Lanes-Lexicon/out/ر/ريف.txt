ريف1
رَافَ, aor. يَرِيفُ, He (a man of the desert)
came to the رِيف; (T, O, K;) as also ↓ أَرْيَفَ and
↓ تريّف: (K:) or he entered the region, district,
or tract, of cities, towns, or villages, and of cultivated land: or رَافُوا signifies they approached the
رِيف; and so ↓ تريّفوا: (Ham p. 676:) or this last,
they journeyed to the رِيف; (M;) and so ↓ أَرْيَفُوا:
(S, * M:) or ↓ تريّفنا, we abode, or stayed, in [a
region of] cities, towns, or villages, and where
water was reached by digging, or where it was
apparent, running upon the surface of the earth.
(T.) ―
-b2-  And رَافَتِ المَاشِيَةُ The cattle pastured in
the رِيف. (S, K.)

رايف لِلظِّنَّةِ He was, or became, near to
[having, or incurring] الظِّنَّة [i. e. suspicion, or
evil opinion]; syn. قَارَفَهَا, and طَنَّفَ لَهَا. (Ibn-
'Abbád, O, K.) [Freytag, app. misled by the
TK, renders رايف, followed by ل, as meaning
“ Falsa protulit, calumniis accusavit. ” He also
assigns to رايف the signification of “ Adpropinquavit regioni ريف,” as on the authority of the
Ham; in which I do not find it.]

أَرْيَفَ see 1, in two places. ―
-b2-  ارافت الأَرْضُ, (S,
M, K,) inf. n. إِرَافَةٌ and [accord. to some] ↓ رِيفٌ;
like اخصبت, inf. n. إِخْصَابٌ and خِصْبٌ; but,
[ISd says,] in my opinion, إِرَافَةٌ is the inf. n., and
رِيفٌ is the subst.; and in like manner one should
say of إِخْصَابٌ and خِصْبٌ; (M, TA;) The land
abounded, or became abundant, with herbage, and
with the goods, conveniences, or comforts, of life;
(S, M, * K;) as also أَرْيَفَت. (K.)

K:) and (K) the part that is near to water, of
the land of the Arabs, (M, O, L, K,) and of
other lands: (M, L:) or the part that is near to
the Sawád (السَّوَاد), of the land of the Arabs:
(IDrd, Ham p. 676:) or a tract in which are
green herbs, and waters, (T, O, K,) and level
lands of seed-produce, (T,) or sown fields, or
varieties of seed-produce: (O, K:) [generally,] a
region, district, or tract, [of cultivated fields; or]
of towns, or villages, and of cultivated land:

M) in respect of food (Lth, T, M, O, K) and
