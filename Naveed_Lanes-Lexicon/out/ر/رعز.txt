رعزمَرْعَزٌ and مَرْعِزٌّ: see what here follows.
مِرْعِزَّى (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and مَرْعِزَّى (S, K)
and ↓ مِرْعِزَآءُ and مَرْعِزَآءُ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and
↓ مِرْعِزٌّ (S, Msb, K) and مَرْعِزٌّ (S, K) and ↓ مَرْعَزٌ,
the last like جَعْفَرٌ, but not مِرْعِزٌ, (Msb,) The
down, (S, Msb, K,) or what resembles wool, (Az,
Mgh,) that is beneath, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) or
amid, (Az,) the hair of the she-goat: (Az, S,
Mgh, Msb, K:) Sb makes مِرْعِزَّى an epithet;
meaning soft, applied to wool: and Kr says
that this and مِرْعِزَآءُ are the only words of these
two measures in the language: (TA:) [he seems
to have held the م to be a radical letter: but
accord. to J,] مرعزّى is of the measure مَفْعِلَّى,
because فَعْلِلَّى does not occur [except in the
instance of شِفْصِلَّى, the name of a certain plant].
(S.)
مَرْعِزَآءُ: see what immediately precedes.
ثَوْبٌ مُمَرْعَزٌ A garment, or piece of cloth, made
of مَرْعِزَّى. (K.)
