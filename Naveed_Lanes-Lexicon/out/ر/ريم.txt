ريم1
رَيْمٌ is syn. with بَرَاحٌ; (Lth, T, M, K;) and
the verb is رَامَ, aor. يَرِيمُ, [He went away, or departed; and he quitted a place: and he ceased
doing a thing:] (Lth, T, TA:) رَيْمٌ being the
inf. n. (TA.) IAar used to say, in relation [or
reply] to the saying مَا رِمْتُ [I did not go away,
&c., or I have not gone away, &c.], بَلَى قَدْ رِمْتُ
[Nay, I did go away, &c., or I have gone away,
&c.]: but others use the verb only with a negative
particle: (T:) or it is mostly used in negative
phrases. (TA.) You say, رَامَهُ, aor. يَرِيمُهُ, (S,
Mgh,) inf. n. as above, (S,) He went away from

الفَضْلُ [which may be rendered He who is chidden, it is incumbent on him to exceed; or he who

been distributed (T, S) in the game called المَيْسِر,
(T,) and which is given to the slaughterer: (M,
K:) accord. to Lh, the camel for slaughter is

it from pollution, having divided it into ten
portion, namely, the two haunches, and the two
thighs, and the rump, and the withers, and the
breast, and [the part of the back called] the
مَلْحَآء [q. v.], and the two shoulders together
with the two arms; then he betakes himself to the
طَفَاطِف [or soft parts, such as the flanks, or the
soft parts of the belly], and the vertebræ of the
neck, and distributes them upon those portions
equally; and if there remain a bone, or a small
piece of flesh, that is the رَيْم: then the slaughterer
waits with it for him who desires it, and he whose
arrow wins, his it is; otherwise, it is for the
slaughterer. (M, TA.) ―
