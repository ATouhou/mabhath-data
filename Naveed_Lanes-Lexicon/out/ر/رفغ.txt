ascribed this explanation to Er-Rághib, who mentions in his book only the words of the Kur-án.

and الارفاغ is the sing. of الرُّفَغُ (واحد الرُّفَغِ [but
this is app. a mistranscription for وُاحِدُهُ الرُّفْغُ
meaning that أَرْفَاغٌ has for its sing: رُفْغٌ]): and
↓ رُفَغٌ signifies the مَغَابِن and مَحَالِب [by which
latter are app. meant the places that sweat] of the
body: accord. to As, what is thus termed is in
camels and in human beings. (TA. [But the
sing. verb in this last clause suggests that there
is another mistranscription here, and a looseness
of explanation; and that we should read thus:
“ and رُفْغٌ (not رُفَغٌ) signifies any of the مَغَابِن and
of the مَحَالِب of the body. ”]) ―
