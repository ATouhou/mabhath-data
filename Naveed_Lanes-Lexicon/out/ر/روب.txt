forth from it? (S. [Or رَائِب in the former
instance may be from رَابَ of which the aor. is
يَرِيبُ; so that it may there mean what occasioned
doubt, or evil opinion: see رَائِبٌ in art. ريب: and
if so, this word as belonging to the present art.,

not, or I have not, mixed honey, nor milk such as

nor milk; thus explaining the two words شوب
and روب without restriction. (M. [See also art.

مُرِيبٌ Having much milk such as is termed
رَائِب. (Har p. 416.)
مُرَوَّبٌ Milk that has not as yet been churned,
and that is in the skin, not having had its butter

-b2-  And سِقَآءٌ مُرَوَّبٌ A
skin in which milk has been made such as is
termed رَائِب: (M, K:) or a skin that is wrapped
up [in order that its milk may thicken more
quickly by its being kept warm] until it attains
the fit time for the churning. (S.) It is said in a
prov., أَهْوَنُ مَظْلُومٍ سِقَآءٌ مُرَوَّبٌ, (T, S, M, A,)
meaning [The lightest in estimation] of what is
drunk, or given to be drunk, [of milk,] before its
butter comes forth from it (As, T) [is that in] a
skin that is wrapped up &c., as expl. above: (S:)
[or (assumed tropical:)  the least to be esteemed of the wronged is he
who remains quiet, or inert, like milk not yet in
a state of fermentation:] AZ mentions it as
applied to him who is low, abject, or contemptible; who is held to be weak: and he says that
ظَلَمْتُ السِّقَآءَ means “ I gave [the milk of] the
skin to be drunk before it had attained to maturity
[so as to be fit for the process of churning]: ”
(T:) or مُرَوَّبٌ signifies not churned, but having
in it its ferment; and the prov. is applied to him
who is constrained to do something that is difficult, and to become in a state of abasement, or
ignominy, and does not manifest any disapproval.
(Meyd.)
