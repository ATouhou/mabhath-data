having water by its side; not otherwise: or, accord. to Aboo-Ziyád El-Kilábee, a tract of plain

the desert are low level places, in which the rainwater stagnates, or remains, or collects, and
which consequently produce various kinds of
herbage, that do not quickly dry up and wither:
that sometimes a رَوْضَة contains thickets of wild
سِدْر: and sometimes it is a mile in length and
breadth: but such as are very wide are termed
قِيعَان. (TA.) It is said in a prov., أَحْسَنُ مِنْ
بَيْضَةٍ فِى رَوْضَةٍ [More beautiful than an egg in a
meadow, or garden]. (A, TA.) And one says,
أَنَا عِنْدَكَ فِى رَوْضَةٍ (tropical:)  [I, in thy presence, am as

مَجْلِسُكَ رَوْضَةٌ مِنْ رِيَاضِ الجَنَّةِ (tropical:)  [Thy sittingplace is like a meadow, or garden, of the meadows,
