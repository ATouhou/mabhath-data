لِيَرْبُوَ فِى أَمْوَالِ النَّاسِ فَلَا يَرْبُو ↓ وَمَا آتَيْتُمْ
عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ, in the Kur [xxx. 38], (T, Bd,) means
And what ye give of forbidden addition in commercial dealing, [i. e. of usury,] (Bd,) or what
ye give of anything for the sake of receiving more
in return, (Zj, T, Bd,) and this is not forbidden
accord. to most of the expositions, though there is
no recompense [from God] for him who exceeds
what he has received, (Zj, T,) in order that it
may increase the possessions of men, (T, * Bd,)
it shall not increase with God, (T, Bd,) nor will
He bless it: (Bd:) some (namely, the people of
El-Hijáz, T, or Náfi' and Yaakoob, Bd) read
↓ لِتُرْبُوا, (T, Bd,) meaning, in order that ye may
increase [the property of men], or in order that
ye may have forbidden addition [or usury therein].

TA) and رُبْوٌ, (M, TA,) with damm, (TA,) this

his care and protection]. (S, M, K.) ―
-b4-  رَبَتِ
الأَرْضُ The ground [being rained upon] became
large, and swelled. (M, TA.) In the Kur xxii. 5
and xli. 39, for وَرَبَتْ, some read وَرَبَأَتٌ: the
former means and [becomes large, and swells; or]
increases: the latter means “ and rises. ” (T.

he was, or became, out of breath; his breath
became interrupted by reason of fatigue or running &c.; or he panted, or breathed shortly or
uninterruptedly; syn. اِنْبَهَرَ: (TA:) and so ↓ تربّى;

&c.; syn. بُهِرْنَا. (M.) ―

grows, or increases, such as a child, and seedproduce, and the like; (S;) as also ↓ تَرَبَّيْتُهُ:
(Mgh, K:) the former is said to be originally
رَبَبْتُهُ. (Er-Rághib, TA. [See 1 in art. رب, in
two places.]) [Thus رَبَّيْتُ signifies I reared, or
cultivated, plants or trees.] And ربّى is said of
earth, or soil, meaning It fostered plants or herbage. (L in art. رشح, &c.) And يُنَوِّرُ وَلَا يُرَبِّى

but does not mature its produce]. (AHn, M and

عَنْ خِنَاقِهِ [in the CK خُناقِه, which I think a
mistranscription,] (tropical:)  I removed, or eased, [his

multiply the recompense thereof, (Bd, Jel,) and

الرِّبَا [i. e. the practising, or taking, of usury or

as also ↓ رَبَا, aor. رَبْوٌ; for] إِرْبَآءٌ and رَبْوٌ, as inf. ns.,
both signify, in Pers., رِبَا خوُرْدَنْ. (KL. [In the
TA, رَبَا, said of a man, is expl. by the words
حصل فى ربوة: but I think that the right reading
must be حَصَّلَ فِى رِبًوا, or مِنْ رِبًوا; and the
meaning, He acquired in the practice of usury
or the like, or he acquired of usury or the like.])
See, again, an ex. in the first paragraph. ―
-b3-  اربى
عَلَى الخَمْسَينَ, (M, Msb,) وَنَحْوِهَا, (M,) He
exceeded [the age of fifty, and the like]. (M,

with dál.]

near the end of the paragraph.
-A3-  تَرَبَّيْتُهُ: see 2.
رَبْوٌ: see رُبْوَةٌ. ―
-b2-  Also A company (IAar, T,
K, TA) of men: (IAar, T, TA:) pl. أَرْبَآءُ: (IAar,
T, K, TA:) and ↓ رِبْوَةٌ likewise signifies a company; or, as some say, ten thousand; as also
رُبَّةٌ; (M, TA;) or the former of these two words,
(i. e. ربوة,) accord. to the A, signifies a great
company of men, such as ten thousand. (TA.)
It is said in the K that ↓ رِبْوَةٌ signifies Ten thousand dirhems; as also ↓ رُبَةٌ: but in this assertion
are errors; for the former of these two words
signifies as explained in the foregoing sentence;
and the latter of them is with teshdeed, belonging
to art. رب, and signifies a company [or great
company] of men. (TA.)
-A2-  Also, (T, S, M, K,
TA,) and ↓ رَبْوَةٌ, (M, TA,) The state of being out
of breath; interruption of the breath by reason
of fatigue or running &c.: or a panting, or
breathing shortly or uninterruptedly: syn. بُهْرٌ,
(T, M, TA,) and اِنْبِهَارٌ: (TA:) or a loud (lit.
high) breathing: (S:) and a state of inflation of
the جَوْف [or chest]. (M, TA.) [The former
word is now often used as signifying Asthma.]
رِبًا, (T, M, Msb, K,) or ↓ رِبًوا, (S, Mgh,) [for it
is often thus written, and generally thus in the
copies of the Kur-án,] with the short ا accord. to
the pronunciation best known, (Msb,) [which
implies that it is also pronounced ↓ رِبَآءٌ,] An excess,
and an addition: (Msb:) an addition over and
above the principal sum [that is lent or expended]:
but in the law it signifies an addition obtained in
a particular manner: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [i. e.
usury, and the like; meaning both unlawful, and
lawful, interest or profit; and the practice of
taking such interest or profit:] it is in lending,
(Zj, T,) or in buying and selling, (S,) and in
giving: and is of two kinds; unlawful, and lawful: the unlawful is any loan for which one receives more than the loan, or by means of which
one draws a profit; [and the gain made by such
means:] and the lawful is a gift by which a man
invites more than it to be given to him, or a gift
that he gives in order that more than it may be
given to him; [and the addition that he so obtains:]
(Zj, T:) [it generally means] an addition that is
obtained by selling food [&c.] for food [&c.],
or ready money for ready money, to be paid at
an appointed period; or by exchanging either of
such things for more of the same kind: (Bd in ii.
276:) or the taking of an addition in lending and
in selling: (PS:) [it is said to be] i. q. عِينَةٌ:
(M, K:) [but although رِبًا and عِينَةٌ are both
applicable sometimes in the same case, neither of
them can be properly said to be generally
explanatory of the other, or syn. therewith:
رِبَا النَّسِيْئَةِ is a term specially employed to signify
profit obtained in the case of a delay of payment:
and رِبَا الفَضْلِ to signify profit obtained by the
superior value of a thing received over that of a
thing given:] the dual of رِبًا (M, Msb, K) or رِبًوا
(S) is رِبَوَانِ and رِبَيَانِ; (S, M, Msb, K;) the
former being agreeable with the original; (M,
Msb;) the ى in the latter being because of the
imáleh occasioned by the preceding kesreh. (M.)
See an ex. near the beginning of the first paragraph
of this art. ↓ رُبْيَةٌ, thus pronounced by the Arabs,
but by the relaters of a trad., in which it occurs,
↓ رُبِّيَّةٌ, (Fr, T, S, Mgh,) or, as some say, ↓ رُبَيَّةٌ,
as though this were the dim. of رُبْيَةٌ, (Mgh,) is a
dial. var. of رِبًوا [or رِبًا]; and by rule should be
رُبْوَةٌ: (Fr, T, S, Mgh:) or, accord. to Z, رُبّيَّةٌ may
be of the measure فُعُّولَةٌ from الرِّبَا. (TA.) [See
also رَمَآءٌ, in art. رمى.]

(T, S, M, K) and ↓ رِبَاوَةٌ (M, K) and ↓ رُبَاوَةٌ (IJ,
K) and ↓ رَابِيَةٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and ↓ رَبَآءَةٌ;
(M, K;) A hill; i. e. an elevation of ground, or
elevated ground: (T, S, M, K:) or an elevated
place: so called because it is high: (Msb, TA:)
the pl. of رُبْوَةٌ is رُبًى (T, Msb) and رُبِىٌّ: (T:)
and the pl. of ↓ رَابِيَةٌ is رَوَابٍ; (T, Msb;) which
ISh explains as meaning elevated sands, like the
دَكْدَاكَة [q. v.], but higher and softer than the
latter; the latter being more compact and rugged;
the رابية, he says, has in it depression and elevation; it produces the best and the most numerous
of the herbs, or leguminous plants, that are found
in the sands; and men alight upon it. (T.)
