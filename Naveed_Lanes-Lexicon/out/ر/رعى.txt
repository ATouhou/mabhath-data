(S, * K, * JM;) and ↓ ارتعت, and ↓ ترعّت; (K;)
The cattle [pastured, or] pastured by themselves.
(Msb.) And رَعَتِ المَاشِيَةُ الكَلَأَ, inf. n. رَعْىٌ
(Mgh, TA) and رِعَايَةٌ [and مَرْعًى]; and ↓ ارتعت,
and ↓ ترعّت; [The cattle pastured upon, or depastured, the herbage;] all signifying the same:
(TA:) and of a camel you say, رَعَى الكَلَأَ بِنَفْسِهِ,
inf. n. رَعْىٌ [&c., He pastured upon, or depastured, the herbage by himself]; and in like manner ↓ ارتعى. (S.) ―
-b2-  The saying of 'Áïsheh
فَإِنْ كَانَتْ تَرْعَى مَا هُنَالِكَ is an allusion to the
feeling, or touching, of the فَرْج itself. (Mgh.)
-A2-  رَعْىٌ also signifies The keeping, or tending,
animals; pasturing, or feeding, them; and defending them from the enemy. (Er-Rághib, TA.)
You say, رَعَيْتُ الإِبِلَ, (S,) or المَاشِيَةَ, (Msb, K,)
or الغَنَمَ, (MA,) aor. أَرْعَاهَا, (S, Msb,) inf. n. رَعْىٌ
(S, MA) [and رِعَايَةٌ, as appears from a phrase
mentioned below,] and رِعْيَةٌ, (MA,) or this last is
a simple subst. from this verb, (K,) I [kept, or
tended, or] pastured, (MA, Msb,) or lead to
pasture, (MA,) the camels, (S,) or the cattle,
(Msb, K,) or the sheep or goats; (MA;) and
↓ ارعاها signifies the same as رَعَاهَا. (K.) And
صِنَاعَتُهُ رِعَايَةُ الإِبِلِ [His habitual work, or occupation, is the tending, or pasturing, of camels].
(ISd, K.) And فُلَانٌ يَرْعَى أَبِيهِ [Such a
one tends, or pastures, for his father;] i. e.
يَرْعَى غَنَمَهُ [tends, or pastures, his father's sheep
or goats]. (S.) ―
-b2-  And hence, as also رِعَايَةٌ, The
keeping or guarding [a person or thing]; being
mindful or regardful [of him or it]; and managing
or ruling or governing [him or it]. (Er-Rághib,
TA.) You say, رَعَيْتُهُ I kept, or guarded, him, as
a ruler or governor, or a prince or commander,
who manages, conducts, orders, or regulates, the
affairs of the people: (Msb:) and رَعَى الأَمِيرُ رَعِيَّتَهُ
[The prince ruled, or governed, his subjects],
inf. n. رِعَايَةٌ. (S.) And رَعْيًا لَكَ [I beg God's
keeping, or guarding, for thee]; meaning رَعَاكَ اللّٰهُ
May God keep thee, or guard thee. (Har p. 617.)
And رَعَى أَمْرَهُ, (K,) inf. n. رَعْىٌ (TA) [and رِعَايَةٌ],
He was mindful, or regardful, of his affair,
or case; as also امره ↓ راعى, (K, TA,) inf. n.
مُرَاعَاةٌ. (TA.) And رِعَآءٌ [app. as an inf. n. of
↓ راعى] signifies The guarding of palm-trees.
(TA.) فَمَا رَعَوْهَا حَقَّ رِعَايَتِهَا, in the Kur [lvii. 27],
means But they did not observe it with its right,
or due, observance; were not mindful, watchful,
observant, or regardful, of it, in the right, or
due, manner of being so. (TA.) You say also,
رَعَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ حُرْمَتَهُ, inf. n. رِعَايَةٌ, (ISk, S,) i. e. 1
was mindful, regardful, or observant, of his حرمة
[meaning of what was entitled to reverence, respect, honour, or defence, in his character and
appertenances]: and in like manner, ↓ مُرَاعَاةٌ
الحُقُوقِ, mentioned in the S, means The being
mindful, regardful, or observant, of rights, or
dues. (PS.) This last phrase is from ↓ رَاعَيْتُهُ,
inf. n. مُرَاعَاةٌ, (TA,) which means I regarded
him; had regard, or an eye, to him; or paid
regard, or consideration, to him; (S, Msb, K,
TA;) acting, or behaving, well to him; doing
good to him; or conferring a benefit, or benefits,
upon him. (K, TA.) [Hence also, فِيهِ كَذَا ↓ رُوعِىَ
Regard is had, in it, (the meaning of a word or
phrase,) to such a thing, as alluded to therein.]
And الأَمْرَ ↓ رَاعَيْتُ, (S, K,) inf. n. مُرَاعَاةٌ, (TA,)
signifies also I looked to see what would be the
issue, or result, of the affair, or case. (S, Msb,
K.) Hence, accord. to Er-Rághib, النُّجُومِ ↓ مُرَاعَاةُ:
(TA:) you say, رَعَى النُّجُومَ; (S, K;) and ↓ رَاعَاهَا,
(K,) inf. n. مُرَاعَاةٌ; (TA;) He watched the stars,
(S, K, TA,) waiting for the time when they would
disappear. (K, TA.) El-Khansà says,
↓ أَرْعَى النُّجومَ وَمَا كُلِّفْتُ رِعْيَتَهَا
وَتَارَةً أَتَغَشَّى فَضْلَ أَطْمَارِى
[I watch, or I watching, the stars, waiting for
the time when they will, or would, disappear,
though I am not, or I was not, tasked with the
watching of them; and at one time I cover myself, or covering myself, with the redundant parts
of my old and worn-out garments]. (S.) ―
-b3-  رِعَايَةٌ
also signifies The being faithful to an engagement,
or promise; syn. وَفَآءٌ. (Mgh. [See رَاعٍ, below;
last sentence.])
2
رعّاهُ, inf. n. تَرْعِيَةٌ, He said [of him], رَعَاهُ اللّٰهُ
[May God keep him, or guard him: or he said
to him, رَعَاكَ اللّٰهُ May God keep thee, or guard
thee]. (TA.)
3
راعى الحِمَارُ الحُمُرَ The ass pastured with the
[other] asses: (S, K:) and in like manner one
says of camels with wild animals. (TA.) ―
-b2-  راعت
الأَرْضُ, a reading required by the context in the
K, is wrong; the correct phrase being ارعت
الأَرْضُ [q. v.]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See also 1, in the latter
half of the paragraph, in eight places. ―
-b4-  المُرَاعَاةُ is
also syn. with المُنَاظَرَةُ [app. as meaning The looking towards, or facing, a person or thing: a signification nearly like the last referred to in the
sentence here immediately preceding]. (TA.) ―
-b5-
See also 4, in three places. ―
-b6-  وَرِّعِ اللِّصَّ وَلَا تُرَاعِهِ,
in a trad. of 'Omar, means Restrain thou the
thief, or make him to refrain, from taking thy
goods, but bear not witness against him: so says
Lth: or the meaning is, and do not wait for
him. (TA.)
4
ارعى المَاشِيَةَ i. q. رَعَاهَا: see 1, in the former
half of the paragraph. Said of God, it means He
caused to grow, for the cattle, that upon which
they might pasture. (S.) One says also ارعت
الأَرْضُ, [as though المَاشِيَةَ or the like were understood] The land abounded [as though it fed abundantly] with herbage: (Zj, K:) راعت الأَرْضُ, in
this sense [as stated above, see 3,] is wrong. (TA.)
And ارعاهُ المَكَانَ He made the place to be a
pasturage for him. (ISd, K.) ―
-b2-  أَرعَيْتُهُ سَمْعِى
means I made my ear, or ears, to be mindful of
his speech: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or I gave ear,
hearkened, or listened, to him. (S, Msb.) You
say, أَرْعِنِى سَمْعَكَ, (Msb, K,) and ↓ رَاعِنِى, i. e.
Hearken thou, or listen thou, to my speech. (K.)
Hence ↓ رَاعِنَا in the Kur [ii. 98 and iv. 48]: Akh
says that it is of the form فَاعِلْنَا from المُرَاعَاةُ, and
means أَرْعِنَا سَمْعَكَ; the ى having gone away
because it is an imperative: he says also that it
is read رَاعِنًا, as an objective complement, from
الرُّعُونَةُ: (S: [see art. رعن:]) the reading in Ibn-Mes'ood's copy of the Kur-án is رَاعُونَا. (TA.)
You say also, هُوَ لَا يُرْعِى إِلَى قَوْلِ أَحَدٍ He will
not pay any regard, or attention, to the saying
of any one. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And أَرْعَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ I showed
mercy to him [by sparing him, or letting him
live, or by pardoning him, or otherwise]; had
mercy on him; pitied, or compassionated, him;
syn. أَبْقَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ and تَرَحَّمْتُهُ. (S, K.) Aboo-Dahbal says,
إِنْ كَانَ هٰذَا السِّحْرُ مِنْكِ فَلَا
تُرْعِى عَلَىَّ وَجَدِّدِى سِحْرَا
[app. meaning If this enchantment be from thee,
then spare me not, but renew enchantment].
(TA. [It seems to be there cited as an instance
of the verb's having a second objective complement; (for which I see no reason;) following
the assertion that one says, أَرْعَى عَلَيْهِ كَذَا, signifying ابقى; and that the verb is made trans. by
means of على as properly meaning ارعاه متطلعا
عليه: but I doubt not that the correct reading is
أَرْعَاهُ مُطَّلِعًا عَلَيْهِ, i. e. He showed mercy to him,
coming to him, or getting sight and knowledge of
him.]) ↓ المُرَاعَآةُ, also, [or المُرَاعَاةُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ,]
signifies الإِبْقَآءُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ. (TA.)

إِرْتَعَىَ see 1, in three places, first two sentences.
10
استرعى [app. signifies He desired cattle to
pasture: and hence, he left them to pasture
alone]. You say, اِسْتَرْعَيْتُ مَالِىَ القَمَرَ, meaning
I left my cattle to pasture without a pastor to
take care of them in the night: and [in like
manner,] استرعيتهُ الشَّمْسَ, in the day. (TA in
art. قمر.) ―
-b2-  اِسْتَرْعَيْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ (S, K *) I asked him,
or desired him, to keep or guard, or be mindful
of or regardful of, the thing. (K, * TA.) Hence
the prov., مَنِ اسْتَرْعَى الذِّئْبَ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ [He who
asks, or desires, the wolf to keep guard does
wrong]; (S, TA;) i. e. he who trusts in one who
is treacherous puts trust in a wrong place. (TA.)
[And hence also,] اِسْتَرْعَى الأَسْمَاعَ لِخُطْبَتِهِ He
asked, or desired, the ears [meaning the hearers]
to mind his discourse, or oration. (Har p. 361.)
رِعْىٌ and ↓ مَرْعًى Pasture, or herbage; (S,
Mgh, K;) the food of beasts: (Msb:) pl. of the
former أَرْعَآءٌ [meaning kinds, or sorts, of pasture
or herbage]: (K:) and of ↓ the latter مَرَاعٍ.
(Msb.) It is said in a prov., وَلَا كَالسَّعْدَانِ ↓ مَرْعًى
[Pasture, but not like the سعدان: see art. سعد].
(S.) ―
-b2-  رِعْىُ الحَمَامِ وَالإِبِلِ A certain herb, having
berries like myrtle-berries, in which is the least
degree of sweetness; not injurious to the camels
that feed upon it, but poison to [venomous or
noxious reptiles or the like, such as are termed]
هَوَامّ: the decoction thereof blackens the hair.
(Ibn-Seenà, book ii. p. 252.)
رِعْيَةٌ a subst. from 1 in the first of the senses
mentioned in this art.; i. e. [The act of cattle's
pasturing, or their pasturing alone,] from رَعَتِ
المَاشِيَةُ. (K.) ―
-b2-  [Also The act, or occupation,
of keeping or tending, or of pasturing or feeding,
animals.] You say [of a man], يُجِيدُ رِعْيَةَ الإِبِلِ
[He performs well the act of keeping or tending,
or of pasturing or feeding, camels]. (S, K.) ―
-b3-
[And The act of watching, and waiting for the
time of the disappearance, of the stars.] See a
verse cited near the end of the first paragraph.
-A2-  Also Land in which are projecting stones that
impede the plough. (K, TA.)
رَعْوَى and رُعْوَى: see the next paragraph. ―
-b2-
[Both seem to be also substs. from أَرْعَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ;
and thus to be syn. with بَقْوَى and بُقْوَى; and in
like manner, ↓ رُعْيَا is probably syn. with بُقْيَا:
the radical ى being changed into و as it is in
بقوى.] You say, مَا لِى عَلَيْهِ رَعْوَى وَلَا بَقْوَى [I
have no mercy nor pity to bestow upon him].
(JK in art. بقى. [See بُقْيَا.]) See also 1 in art.
رعو [from which رَعْوَى in this phrase may also
with reason be regarded as derivable].
رُعْيَا a subst. from رَعَى as used in the phrase
رَعَى أَمْرَهُ [expl. in the first paragraph; thus signifying Mindfulness, regardfulness, or observance,
of an affair, or a case]; as also ↓ رَعْوَى and ↓ رُعْوَى.
(K.) ―
-b2-  See also the next preceding paragraph.
And see art. رعو.
[
رَعِىٌّ Pastured: ruled, or governed: and kept,
or guarded: so accord. to Golius, as on the authority of the KL; but not in my copy of that work.
It is agreeable with analogy as syn. with مَرْعِىٌّ:
and from it is formed the subst. next following.]
رَعِيَّةٌ [with ة affixed لِلنَّقْلِ, i. e., to transfer the
word from the category of epithets to that of
substantives,] Cattle pasturing, or pasturing by
themselves: and cattle kept, tended, or pastured:
(K, TA:) pl. رَعَايَا: (TA:) this latter (the pl.)
signifies cattle kept, tended, or pastured, for any
one; (K, TA;) for the subjects and for the
Sultán; (TA;) as also ↓ رَعَاوِيَّةٌ: (K, TA: in
some copies of the K رَعَاوِيَة, without teshdeed:)
and ↓ أَرْعَاوِيَّةٌ signifies cattle kept, tended, or
pastured, for the Sultán, (K, TA,) especially,
and upon which are his brands and marks. (TA.)
Hence the trad., كُلُّ رَاعٍ مَسْؤُولٌ عِنْ رَعِيَّتِهِ [Every
pastor shall be questioned respecting his pastured
cattle: or every ruler shall be questioned respecting his subjects; agreeably with what follows].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  The people ruled or governed; the subjects of a ruler or governor: (Msb, K:) the
community; the people in common or in general;
or the common people: (S:) [any persons or
person, and things or thing, in the keeping, or
under the guardianship or rule or government, of
a man or woman:] see رَاعٍ, in the latter half of
the paragraph: pl. as above. (TA.)
رعاءة الخَيْلِ: see رَاعِيَةٌ.
رَعَاوَى and رُعَاوَى Camels that pasture around
the people and their dwellings (S, K) because they
are those upon which they work [or perform their
business]: (S:) but in the Tekmileh it is written
↓ رُعَاوِيَّةٌ, as meaning cattle that pasture around
the dwellings of the people. (TA.)
رَعَاوِيَّةٌ: see رَعِيَّةٌ.
رُعَاوِيَّةٌ: see رَعَاوَى.
رَاعٍ [act. part. n. of 1]. You say مَاشِيَةٌ رَاعِيَةٌ
Cattle [pasturing, or] pasturing by themselves:
(Msb:) pl. رَوَاعِى [a mistranscription for رَوَاعٍ].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  رَاعِى البُسْتَانِ and الأُتُنِ ↓ رَاعِيَةُ are names
of Two species of جَنَادِب [or locusts]; (K;) the
latter mentioned by ISd: Sgh says that the former
is a large جُنْدَب: and the latter is another species,
that does not fly. (TA.) ―
-b3-  رَاعٍ also signifies A
keeper, or guarder, (TA,) or pastor, (Msb,) of
cattle: (Msb, TA:) an epithet in which the
quality of a subst. is predominant: (TA:) pl.
رُعَاةٌ, (S, Msb, TA,) but this is said to be mostly
used as pl. of رَاعٍ in another sense as will be
shown below, (TA,) and رِعَآءٌ [and app. رُعَآءٌ (mentioned below)] and رُعْيَانٌ; (S, Msb, TA;) and
رُعَاةٌ has a pl., namely, رُعًى. (TA.) ―
-b4-  [Hence,]
الرَّاعِى is the name of The star [a] that is upon
the head of الحَوَّآء [i. e. Ophiuchus]: that which
is upon the head of الحاوى [a mistranscription in
my MS. for الجَاثِى, i. e. Hercules, the star a,]
being called كَلْبُ الرَّاعِى. (Kzw.) Also The star
[
γ] that is upon the left leg of Cepheus: between
whose legs is a star [app. K] that is called كَلْبُ
الرَّاعِى: (Kzw:) [from their longitudes it seems
that these two stars are the same as are meant by
what here follows:] الكَلْبُ [or كَلْبُ الرَّاعِى] is a
certain star over against الدَّلْو [or Aquarius,
which latter is] below; in the path of which is a
red [or perhaps another (آخَر instead of أَحْمَر)]
star, called الرَّاعِى. (TA in art. كلب.) [And
accord. to Freytag, رَاعِى الجَوْزَآءِ is the name of
A star otherwise called the Foot of Orion: and
رَاعِى النَّعَائِمِ, the name of The star
λ in Sagittarius: see Ideler's “ Untersuch. über den Ursprung etc. der Sternnamen,” to which he refers,
pp. 213, 226, for the former; and p. 187 for the
latter.] ―
-b5-  [And hence,] رَاعٍ signifies also A ruler,
or governor, (S, K,) or prince, or commander,
(Msb,) who manages, conducts, orders, or regulates, the affairs of a people: (Msb, K:) and a
ruler, or governor, of himself: (TA:) pl. رُعَاةٌ
and رُعْيَانٌ, (K,) but it is said that the former is
mostly used as meaning rulers, or governors, and
the latter as pl. of رَاعٍ in relation to sheep or goats
[or the like], (TA,) and رِعَآءٌ and رُعَآءٌ. (K.) It is
said in a trad., كُلُّكُمْ رَاعٍ وَكُلُّكُمْ مَسْؤُولٌ عِنْ
↓ رَعِيَّتِهِ [Every one of you is a ruler, or governor,
and every one of you shall be questioned respecting
those, or that, of which he is ruler or governor]:
such is the man in respect of his family, and in
respect of the property of his father; and the
servant in respect of the property of his master;
and the wife is a رَاعِيَة in respect of the house, or
tent, of her husband: and every one of these shall
be questioned respecting his, or her, رَعِيَّة. (ElJámi' es-Sagheer of Es-Suyootee.) And one says,
كَالرَّاعِى ↓ لَيْسَ المَرْعِىُّ [The ruled, or governed,
is not like the ruler, or governor]. (S.) ―
-b6-  In the
saying of El-Karkhee, بَاعَ طَيْرًا عَلَى أَنَّهُ رَاعٍ, relating to [carrier-] pigeons, it is from الرِّعَايَةُ
signifying الوَفَآءُ; [the saying meaning He sold
birds on the condition of their being such as would
be faithful to their charge;] for pigeons in El-
'Irák and Syria are bought for high prices, and
sent from distant points with letters of informations, and convey them, and bring back replies to
them. (Mgh, JM.)
رَاعِيَةٌ [fem. of رَاعٍ. ―
-b2-  Also a subst. formed from
the latter word by the affix ة; like رَعِيَّةٌ from
رَعِىٌّ]: see راعٍ, third sentence. ―
-b3-  الرَّاعِيَةُ is the
name of A certain bird: (TA:) [and] so is
رَاعِيَةُ الخَيْلِ; (TA, and thus in some copies of the
K;) thus correctly written, as in the Tekmileh;
in [some of] the copies of the K, راعية الجبل;
[perhaps the same as the former bird;] a yellow
bird, that is found beneath the bellies of horses or
similar beasts; thus in the Tekmileh; said by ISh
to be a small bird like the sparrow, that alights
beneath the bellies of the horses and other beasts,
yellow, as though its neck and wings were tinged
with saffron, its back having upon it a dinginess,
or duskiness, and blackness, its head being yellow,
and its زِمِكَّى [or tail] being neither long nor
short; accord. to Sgh, also called الخيل ↓ رعاءة.
(TA [thus written without any syll. signs: if
applying to the species in the manner of a coll.
gen. n., perhaps a mistranscription for رُعَاةُ الخَيْلِ].)
―
-b4-  رَاعِيَةُ الشَّيْبِ, and رَوَاعِى الشَّيْبِ, (tropical:)  The commencement of hoariness, (K, TA,) and the first

should be formed from an unaugmented verb
accord. to many of the grammarians: ―
-b2-  and
hence, being nearly syn. with أَرْفَقُ in the primary
sense, syn. with this latter, or nearly so, in a
secondary sense]. You say, أَمْرُ كَذَا أَرْفَقُ بِى
