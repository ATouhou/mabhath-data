-A3-  رَاقَنِى, (JK, S,

is commonly known,]) and راقَهُ, (K,) aor. as

أَرْوَقَ: see 2.
-A2-  اراقهُ, (Msb in art. ريق, and
K in that and the present art.,) inf. n. إِرَاقَةٌ, (S in
the present art., and so in the K accord. to the
TA,) He poured it out, or forth; (S, Msb, K;)
namely, water and the like, (S,) or water and
blood: (Msb:) and one says also هَرَاقَهُ, (Msb,
TA,) changing the أ into ه, originally هَرْيَقَهُ, like
دَحْرَجَهُ, in measure, (Msb,) said by Lh to be of
the dial. of El-Yemen, and afterwards to have
spread among Mudar, (TA in art. ريق,) aor.
يُهَرِيقُهُ, (Msb, TA,) with fet-h to the ه, imperative
هَرِقْ, originally هَرْيِقْ, like دَحْرِجْ, (Msb,) inf. n.
هِرَاقَةٌ; (S and K in art. هرق;) and أَهْرَاقَهُ, aor.
يُهْرِيقُهُ, (Msb, TA,) with the ه quiescent, like
يُسْطِيعُ aor. of إِسْطَاعَ; or, accord. to the T, أَهْرَقْتُ
is wrong as being anomalous; and some say,
هَرَقْتُهُ, aor.
رَوَقَ, inf. n. هَرْقٌ, as though the ه were
radical. (Msb.) It is said in a trad., إِنَّ امْرَأَةً
كَانَتْ تُهَرَاقُ الدِّمَآءَ or تُهْرَاقُ, the verb being in
the pass. form, and the ه either meftoohah or
quiescent, and الدماء being in the accus. case as
a specificative; [so that the meaning is, Verily a
woman used to pour forth with blood; for تهراق
is equivalent to تَرِيقُ; but by rule the specificative
should be without the article ال;] or الدماء may
be in the nom. case, الدِّمَآءُ being for دِمَاؤُهَا [i. e.
her blood used to pour forth]. (Msb.) ISd says
that أَرَاقَ is judged to be originally أَرْوَقَ because
the medial radical letter of a verb is more commonly
و than ى; and because, when water is poured forth,
its clearness appears, and it excites the admiration
and approval of its beholder; [to which may be
added, also because one says, هُما يَتَرَاوَقَانِ المَآءَ;]
though Ks states that رَاقَ المَآءُ, aor. يَرِيقُ, signifies
The water poured out, or forth: IB says that
أَرَقْتُ المَآءَ is from راق المَآءُ, aor. يَرِيقُ, inf. n. رَيْقٌ,
signifying the water went to and fro upon the
surface of the earth. (TA.) One says also, of a
man, اراق مَآءَ ظَهْرِهِ and هَرَاقَهُ and أَهْرَاقَهُ [meaning
He poured forth his seminal fluid]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
أَرِقْ عَنْكَ مِنَ الظَّهِيرَةِ and هَرِقْ meaning (assumed tropical:)  Stay

Also (assumed tropical:)  He ran vehemently: (A 'Obeyd, S, O, K:)
not known, however, to Sh, in this sense; but
known to him as meaning (assumed tropical:)  he strove, laboured,

[Agreeably with this last explanation, it is said
that] رَوْقٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A man's determination,

أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ أَرْوَاقَهُ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  He devoted his mind

or him, (أَنْ يُحِبَّهُ,) vehemently [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  he loved
it, or him, vehemently; agreeably with explanations of the saying القى عليه شراشره in art. شر,
q. v.]. (Thus in the JM. [In my two copies of
the S, and in the O and K, and hence in the TA,
in the places of عَلَيْهِ and يُحِبَّهُ we find عَلَيْكَ and
تُحِبَّهُ; evidently mistranscriptions which have
been copied by one lexicographer after another
without due consideration: or, if we read عَلَيْكَ,
we should read يُحِبَّكَ; for in this case the meaning of the saying would certainly be he loved thee
vehemently. Freytag, misled by the reading تُحِبَّهُ
in the S and K, renders القى عليك ارواقه as
meaning Magno amore erga ipsum te accendit.
Golius gives, in its place, ضرب اوراقه عليه (for
ارواقه), as meaning Valde amavit eum.]) ―
-b11-  You

water that was in it: (IAmb, O, TA:) or this
saying, (O, TA,) or the former, (K,) means cast
down its clear waters; (O, K, TA;) from رَاقَ المَآءُ
signifying “ the water was, or became, clear: ”
but IAmb deems this improbable, because the
Arabs did not say مَآءٌ رَوْقٌ and مَاآنِ رَوْقَانِ and
أَمْوَاهٌ أَرْوَاقٌ: (O, TA:) [i. e. they said رَوْقٌ only, in
all cases when they used it as an epithet meaning
“ clear,” because it is originally an inf. n., like
عَدْلٌ &c.:] or, as some say, by بارواقها is meant
its waters rendered heavy by the clouds: and one
says, أَرْخَتِ السَّمَآءُ أَرْوَاقَهَا and عَزَالِيهَا (assumed tropical:)  [The sky
loosed, or let down, its spouts; the clouds being
likened to leathern water-bags]: (TA:) [for]

the agony of death itself.])
رُوقٌ is said to be pl. of رُوقَةٌ, and of رَائِقٌ, and

the TA as meaning ما دار مِنْهُ كَرِوَاقِ البَيْتِ: but
دار is here evidently a mistranscription for كَانَ;
