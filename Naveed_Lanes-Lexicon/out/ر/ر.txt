رalphabetical letter
ر
The tenth letter of the alphabet: called رَآءٌ and
رَا: pl. [of the former] رَاآتٌ and [of the latter]
أَرْوَآءٌ. (TA in باب الالف الليّنه.) It is one of the
letters termed مَجْهُورَة [or vocal, i. e. pronounced
with the voice, not with the breath only]; and of
the letters termed ذُلْق, which are, and ل and ن,
[also termed ذَوْلَقِيَّة, or pronounced with the
extremity of the tongue, and ب and ف and م
which are also termed شَفَهِيَّة, or pronounced with
the lips:] these letters which are pronounced with
the tip of the tongue and with the lips abound in
the composition of Arabic words: (L:) and hence
ر is termed, in a vulgar prov., حِمَارُ الشُعَرَآءِ [“ the
ass of the poets ”]. (TA in باب الالف اللّينة.)
ر is substituted for ل, in نَثْرَةٌ for نَثْلَةٌ, and in رَعَلَّ
for لَعَلَّ, and in وَجِرٌ and أَوْجَرُ for وَجِلٌ and أَوْجَلُ;
and this substitution is a peculiarity of the dial. of
Keys; wherefore some assert that the ر in these
cases is an original radical letter. (MF.)
-A2-  [As
a numeral, it denotes Two hundred..]
رَ is an imperative of رَأَى [q. v.]. (AZ, T and
S and M in art. رأى.)
