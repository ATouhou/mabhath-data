رَتِلَ الثَّغْرُ, aor.
رَتَلَ, inf. n. رَتَلٌ, The front teeth
were, or became, even in their growth, (Msb,)
[or separate, one from another, and even in the

تَرْتِيلٌ, in its original sense, relates to the
teeth; signifying تَفْلِيج thereof [i. e., as inf. n. of
the verb in its pass. form, Their being separate,
one from another]. (Bd in xxv. 34.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
رتّل الكَلَامَ, (T, M, K,) inf. n. تَرْتِيلٌ, (K,) He
put together and arranged well the component parts of the speech, or saying, (M, K,)
and made it distinct: and hence تَرْتِيلُ القُرْآنِ
[explained in what follows]: (M:) or he proceeded in a leisurely manner in the speech, or
saying, [making the utterance distinct,] and put
together and arranged well its component parts:
(T:) and رَتَّلْتُ القُرْآنَ inf. n. as above, I read,
or recited, the Kur-án in a leisurely manner;
without haste: (Msb:) or التَّرْتِيلُ in reading, or
reciting, [and particularly in the reading, or reciting, of the Kur-án,] is the proceeding in a
leisurely manner, and uttering distinctly, without
exceeding the proper bounds or limits: (S:) [and
hence, conventionally, the chanting of the Kur-án
in a peculiar, distinct, and leisurely, manner:]
and فِى كَلَامِهِ ↓ ترتّل, (T,) or فِى الكَلَامِ, (M, K,)
signifies [in like manner] he proceeded in a
leisurely manner (T, M, K) in his speech, or
saying, (T,) or in the speech, or saying: (M, K:)
Mujáhid explains التَّرْتِيل as signifying the proceeding in a leisurely manner [in reading, or
reciting], and as being consecutive in its parts, or
portions; regarding it as etymologically relating
to ثَغْرٌ رَتِلٌ [q. v.]: (T:) accord. to Er-Rághib,
it signifies the pronouncing the word [or words]
with ease and correctness: this is the proper signification: but the conventional meaning, as verified by El-Munáwee, is the being regardful of
the places of utterance of the letters, and mindful
of the pauses, and the lowering of the voice,
and making it plaintive, in reading, or reciting:
(TA:) [accord. to Mtr,] the [proper] meaning
of الترتيل in [the reciting, or chanting, of the
Kur-án and of] the call to prayer &c. is the
pronouncing of the letters in a leisurely manner,
and distinctly, and so giving them their proper
full sound; from the phrase ثَغْرٌ مُرَتَّلٌ and رَتِلٌ
signifying “ front teeth separate, one from another,
and even in the manner of growth, and well set
together. ” (Mgh.) [See also تَرْسِيلٌ.] وَرَتَّلْنَاهُ
تَرْتِيلًا, in the Kur [xxv. 34], means And we have
sent it down unto thee in a leisurely manner:
(M, TA:) or we have recited it to thee part after
part, in a deliberate and leisurely manner; in
[the course of] twenty years, or three and twenty:
تَرْتِيلٌ in its original sense relating to the teeth,
and having the signification explained in the
beginning of this paragraph. (Bd.)
