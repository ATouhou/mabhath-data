رأم1
رَئِمَتْ وَلَدَهَا, (T, S, M, K,) aor.
رَاَ^َ, (T,) inf. n.
رِئْمَانٌ, (T, S, M, K *) and رَأْمٌ (M, K *) and رَأَمَانٌ,
(TA,) She (a camel) loved, (T, S,) or affected,
or inclined to, and kept to, or clave to, (M, K,)
her young one. (T, S, M, K.) And تَرْأَمُ بِأَنْفِهَا is
also said of a she-camel [as meaning She makes a
show of affection with her nose, by smelling her
young one; not having true love]. (S, M, K, all
in art. ذأر; &c. [See مُذَائِرٌ, and see also مُعَارِضٌ.])
A poet says,
أَمْ كَيْفَ يَنْفَعُ مَا تُعْطِى العَلُوقُ بِهِ
رِئْمَانٌ أَنْفٍ إِذَا مَا ضُنَّ بِاللَّبَنِ
or رئمانُ, or رئمانِ, accord. to different relaters:
[i. e. Or how profits what she that smells a young
one but refuses to yield her milk to it gives, (the
ب in بِهِ being redundant,) showing affection
with the nose, (accord. to the first reading,)
or a showing of affection with the nose, (accord. to the second and third readings,) when
there is niggardliness with the milk?] he who
says رئمانَ uses this word as an inf. n.: he
who says رئمانُ makes it a substitute for ما:
and he who says رئمانِ makes it a substitute for
the ه [in بِهِ]. (M.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] رَئِمَ الشَّىْءَ (tropical:)  He
loved the thing, (S, K, TA,) and (S, K, TA)
kept, or clave, to it. (S, M, K, TA.) One says,
رَئِمَتِ الأَثَافِى الرَّمَادَ (tropical:)  [The three stones whereon
the cooking-pot was placed clave to the ashes]:
as though the ashes were their young. (T, K, TA.)
―
-b3-  And رَئِمَ الجُرْحُ, inf. n. رِئْمَانٌ (AZ, T, S, M)
and رَأْمٌ, (M, K,) (tropical:)  The wound coalesced, or closed;
(AZ, T, S, TA;) the mouth of the wound drew
together, or closed, preparatively to healing.
(M, K, * TA.)
-A2-  رَأَمَ, (T, S, M, K,) aor.
رَاَ^َ,
(T, K,) inf. n. رَأْمٌ, (T, M,) He repaired (T, S,
M, K) a crack, or fissure, (M,) or a bowl, (T, K,)
or a crack, or fissure, of a bowl: (S:) like رَأَبَ:
(T, M:) so says Esh-Sheybánee: and [↓ رَآءَمَهُ
signifies the same; for] he cites the following
verse:
وَقَتْلَى بِحِقْفٍ مِنْ أُوَارَةَ جُدِّعَتْ
صَدَعْنَ قُلُوبًا لَمْ تُرَآءَمْ شُعُوبُهَا
[And slain men in a winding tract of sand of
Uwáreh, (a certain water, or mountain, of
Temeem,) that had been mutilated, broke hearts
of which the rifts have not been repaired].
(S, TA.) ―
-b2-  And He twisted a rope hard, or
strongly; as also ↓ ارأم. (M, K.)

رَاَّ^َ see the last sentence but one above.
4
ارأم النَّاقَةَ He made the she-camel to affect,
or incline to, (ISk, T, S, K,) her رَأْم [q. v.],
(ISk, T,) or the رَأْم, (S,) or one that was not her
young one: (K:) or ارأمها عَلَى وَلَدِهَا he made
her to affect, or incline to, her young one. (M.)
―
-b2-  [Hence,] ارأمهُ عَلَى الأَمْرِ, (ISk, T,) or على
الشَّىْءِ, (M, K,) (assumed tropical:)  He compelled him against his
will to do the thing: (ISk, T, M, K:) and so
ازأمهُ عَلَيْهِ. (TA.) And ارأمهُ إِلَىكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He, or
it, caused him to want such a thing. (AA, TA in
art. ذمغ.) ―
-b3-  ارأم الجُرْحَ, (inf. n. إِرآمٌ, T,) (assumed tropical:)  He
dressed, or treated curatively, the wound, (T, S,
M, K,) in order that it might heal, or close, (S,)
or so that it closed. (M, K.) ―
-b4-  See also 1, last
sentence.
5
ترأّمت عَلَى وَلَدِهَا, said of a she-camel, i. q.
تَعَطَّفَتْ عَلَيْهِ [app. meaning, as quasi-pass. of
عَطَّفَهَا عَلَيْهِ, She was made to affect, or incline to,
her young one]. (TT, from the M. [There written
ترآمت, which is, in my opinion, a mistranscription.]) ―
-b2-  تَرَأَّمْتُهُ i. q. تَرَحَّمْتُ عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  [I pitied, or
compassionated, him; or did so much; or affected,
or expressed, pity, or compassion, or much pity or
compassion, for him; or expressed a wish that
God would have mercy on him]. (K, TA.)
8
ارتأم, said by Golius to signify It (a
wound) closed, or became consolidated, as on the
authority of the S and K, I do not find in any
copy of either of those lexicons, nor in any other
lexicon.]
رَأْمٌ A she-camel's young one; (T, S;) accord.
to IAar: (T:) or a she-camel's young one which
she affects, or to which she inclines: (M:) and,
(S, M,) accord. to Lth, (T,) i. q. بَوٌّ [which has
the former of the meanings above, but more commonly signifies a skin of a young unweaned camel
stuffed with straw or with panic grass or with
dry herbage, to which a she-camel is made to
incline when her young one has died; it being
brought near to the mother of a young camel
that has died, in order that she may incline to it
and yield her milk]: (T, S, M, K:) or a young
one to which she that is not its mother is made to
incline. (T.)
فُلَانٌ رُؤْمٌ لِلضَّيْمِ [evidently, I think, a mistranscription, for ↓ رَؤُومٌ, which is also written رَؤُمٌ,]
(tropical:)  Such a one is abject, or ignominious; content to
endure injury.. (TA.)
رِثْمٌ [The antilope leucoryx, or white antelope;]
an antelope (ظَبْىٌ) that is purely white; (T, [in
which only the pl. is mentioned,] S, M, K;) so
accord. to As; (T, S;) and AZ says the like;
(T;) inhabiting the sands: (As, T, S:) or, as
some say, the young one of the ظَبْى [here app.
meaning gazelle]: the female is called رِئْمَةٌ:
(M:) pl. أَرْآمٌ (T, S, M, K) and آرَامٌ; (M, K;)
the latter pl. formed by transposition. (M.)
[Whether the Hebrew
XXX or  or
mean the same animal as the Arabic رِئْم is
doubtful.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,] مَرَّتْ بِنَاالآرَامُ (tropical:)  The
beautiful, or pretty, women passed, or went, by
us: so called by way of comparison. (TA.)
رُئِمٌ, (K, TA,) or الرُّئِمُ, thus accord. to Kr, with
ال, (M,) i. q. الاِسْتُ [The podex, or the anus]:
(Kr, M, K:) [said to be] the only word of its
measure except الدُّئِلُ, which means “ a certain
small beast. ” (M. [But see this last word.])
الرَّأْمَةٌ The خَزَرة [i. e. bead, or the like, that is
worn as an amulet, and] that is [held to be] a
cause of love, or affection. (K.)
رُؤْمَةٌ Glue, with which a thing is stuck: (S:)
accord. to the K, [following A'Obeyd, (see art.
روم,)] it is رُومَةٌ only, without ء: but Th mentions
it with ء also; and both are correct. (MF, TA.)
رُؤَامٌ Slaver: (T, K:) like رُوَالٌ. (T.) [See
also رُوَامٌ, in art. روم.]
رَوُومٌ: see رَائِمٌ. ―
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A ewe, or she-goat,
(El-Umawee, T, S, K,) that is very familiar,
(K,) that licks the clothes of him who passes by
her. (El-Umawee, T, S, K.) ―
-b3-  See also رُؤْمٌ.
رَائِمٌ, (T, M,) or رَائِمَةٌ, (S,) or both, (K,) and
↓ رَؤُومٌ, (T, S, M, K,) [but the last has probably
an intensive signification,] A she-camel that loves,
(T, S,) or affects, or inclines to, and keeps to, or
cleaves to, (M, K,) her young one, (T, S, M, K,)
or the young one of another: if she do not so, but
smells it, and does not yield her milk to it, she is
termed عَلُوقٌ: so says A'Obeyd, on the authority
of As: (T: [see the former of the two verses
cited in the first paragraph of this art.:]) the pl.
of رَائِمَةٌ is رَوَائِمُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, الرَّوَائِمُ signifies (tropical:)  The three stones whereon the cooking-pot is
placed; what are called الأَثَافِى; (T, M, K, TA;)
that have remained cleaving to the ashes: (T, K:)
because of their cleaving to the ashes: (M:) the
ashes being as though they were their young.
(T, K.)
