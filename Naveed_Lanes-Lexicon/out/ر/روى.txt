رِىٌّ (T, S, M, Mgh, * K) and رَىٌّ, (S, K,) or the
former is a simple subst. and the latter is the
inf. n., (Msb,) or the latter is an inf. n. and also
a simple subst., (M, K,) and رِوًى, (S, M, K,)
the last erroneously written, in [some of] the
copies of the K, رَوَى, as though it were a pret.
verb [like رَوِىَ]; (TA;) and ↓ ارتوى and ↓ تروّى;
(S, M, Msb, K;) all signify the same; (T, S, M, *
Msb, K;) [or the last probably has an intensive
meaning;] He was satisfied, or he satisfied himself, with drinking of water [and of milk]; he
drank thereof enough to quench, or satisfy, his
thirst; contr. of عَطِشَ. (Mgh in explanation of
the first.) ―
-b2-  And رَوِىَ النَّبَاتُ, (M,) or الشَّجَرُ,
(K,) مِنَ المَآءِ; (TA;) and ↓ تروّى; (M, K;)

irrigation: or] i. q. تَنَعَّمَ [i. e., became flourishing and fresh, luxuriant, juicy, succulent, or
sappy]; (M, K;) or became bright and fresh, by
reason of plentiful irrigation. (TK.) ―
-b3-  رَوِىَ
and ↓ ارتوى and ↓ تروّى are also used metaphorically, as meaning (tropical:)  He was, or became, in a good
state or condition; and in the enjoyment of much
ease, pleasantness, softness, or delicacy, of life.
(Har p. 100.) ―

likewise metaphorical, meaning (tropical:)  I have become,
or I became, disgusted [or satiated to loathing]

85,) in which يَرْوَى is made trans. by means of
that particle in the place of مِنْ.
-A2-  رَوَى عَلَى أَهْلِهِ,

inf. n. رَيَّةٌ, or رِيَّةٌ, (accord. to different copies of
the T, [the former app. indicated to be the right
by what is said in the next sentence,]) or رَىٌّ,
(M, [probably also correct,]) He brought water
to his family: (S, M, K:) [but in the T it is
implied that the meaning is like that of the phrase
here following:] رَوَى القَوْمَ, (ISk, T, S, K,) aor.
as above, (ISk, T, S,) inf. n. ريّة, (so in the TA,)
He drew water for the people, or party. (ISk,

the ر, (S,) or رِيَّتُكُمْ, (so in the T,) meaning
Whence is your providing of yourselves with
water? (المَآءَ ↓ مِنْ أَيْنَ تَرْتَوُونَ: T, immediately

immediately after the former of them:) so says
ISk. (T.) And رَوَى عَلَى اليَعِيرِ He drew water
upon the camel. (M. [See سَانِيَةٌ.]) ―
-b2-  And رَوَى

camel) bore, carried, or conveyed, water. (Msb,

S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) and الشِّعْرَ, (T, S, M, Mgh,)
عَنْهُ, (MA,) aor. يَرْوِى, (T,) inf. n. رِوَايَةٌ; (T, S,

(MA;) [he related, recited, or rehearsed, the
tradition, &c., and the poetry, by heart from

thou the ode ”]; but you do not say, اِرْوِهَا unless
you mean thereby Relate thou it by heart. (S,
TA.) [One says also, رُوِىَ عَنْهُ, meaning It has
been related as heard, or received, from him.
And رُوِىَ كَذَا, and يُرْوَى كَذَا, meaning It has
been related, and it is related, (otherwise, i. e.)
thus; with the substitution of such a word &c.:
and often meaning it has been read, and it is

روّى, inf. n. تَرْوِيَةٌ: see 4, in two places: ―
-b2-
and 5. [Hence,] يَوْمُ التَّرْوِيَةِ [The day of providing oneself with water;] the eighth day of
Dhu-l-Hijjeh; (T, Msb;) the day before that of
'Arafeh: (M:) so called because they (the pilgrims, T) used to provide themselves (يَتَزَوَّدُونَ,
T, M, or ↓ يَتَرَوَّوْنَ, Msb, and so in a copy of the
T, or ↓ يَرْتَوُونَ, S, K) on that day with water
(T, S, M, * Msb, K) for the aftertime, (S, Msb,
K,) and to rise and go, or when rising to go, to
Minè, where is no water, [or, accord. to the Msb,
where was little water,] therefore they provided
themselves fully with water, or therefore they
provided themselves with water from Mekkeh for
the alighting and abiding at Minè: (T, accord. to
two different copies:) or [it means the day of
consideration, or thought; (from another signification of the verb, as will be seen from what
follows;) and is so called] because Abraham
was considering, or thinking upon, his dream
(وَ يَتَفَكَّرُ فِى رُؤْيَاهُ ↓ كَانَ يَتَرَوَّى) [on that day],
and on the ninth he knew [that his dream was

relate, recite, or rehearse, (Msb, TA,) the poetry,
(TA,) and the tradition, narrative, or story;
(Msb, TA;) [or he taught him to do so; i. e.] he
related to him by heart (رَوَى لَهُ) the poetry, (T,
TA,) and the tradition, narrative, or story,
(TA,) until he retained it in his memory, for the
purpose of relating it by heart [as learned, or
heard, or received,] from him. (T, TA. *) And
رُوِّينَا الحَدِيثَ [We had the tradition, narrative,

with his thirst [thereby]. (Har ubi suprà.) One
says of a she-camel abounding in milk, هِىَ تُرْوِى
الصَّبِىَّ [She satisfies the thirst of the young child]:
because he sleeps in the beginning of the night,
and they desire that her flow of milk may be

like manner, ارواهُ is said of water, and of milk,
&c., meaning It satisfied his thirst.] ―

art. رى.
رِىٌّ, said by Esh-Shámee, in his “Seereh [of

which is anomalous, like رُيَّا, for رُؤْيَا], (MF,

and also (M, K) a simple subst. from that verb

with his thirst satisfied; (T, S; *) applied only to

[but I have looked for it in vain in two copies of

رِوَا, for one of these two may be from the other,]
or ↓ رَوٌّ, (so accord. to my MS. copy of the K and
accord. to the TK, [but this I think very dubious,
and still more strange is the reading in the CK,
which is رِو,]) Abundance of herbage, or of the
goods, conveniences, or comforts, of life. (K.)
رُوَآءٌ [for رُؤَآءٌ, (see رِئْىٌ, in art. رأى,) or of the
measure فُعَالٌ from الرِّىُّ, (see Har p. 24,)] i. q.

should fall in consequence of his being overcome
by sleep: (M, and Ham p. 321:) or one of the
ropes of the [tent called] خِبَآء: and sometimes the
load is bound therewith upon the camel: accord.
to AHn, it is thicker than well-ropes: (M:) and

وَ أَوْمَتْ إِلَيْهِ بِالعُيُونِ الأَصَابِعُ
[When the wealth of the man becomes little, his
friends become few, and, together with the eyes,
the fingers make signs to him]: (Akh, M:) [when
two or more letters are indispensable to the
rhyme, only one of them is thus termed, according
to rules fully explained in the M and in the
treatises on versification:] IJ mentions رَوِيَّاتٌ as
its pl.; but [ISd says,] I think him to have
stated this carelessly, and not to have heard it
from the Arabs. (M.) One says قَصِيدَتَانِ عَلَى
رَوِىٍّ وَاحِدٍ [Two odes constructed upon one rhymeletter; or having one fundamental rhyme-letter]. (S.)
رِوَايَةٌ [an inf. n. of رَوَى, q. v., when used as a
subst., meaning A relation, or recital, &c.,] has
for its pl. رَوَايَا. (JM.) See رَاوِيَةٌ, last sentence

one; meaning we want a thing of such a one]:

want to be supplied to us on thy part; we want

فِى أَمْرٍ, (M, K, *) thus usually pronounced without ء, (S,) [originally رَوِيْئَةٌ,] Inspection, examination, consideration, or thought, of an affair;
(S, M, K;) without haste: (M:) pl. رَوَايَا. (JM,
TA.) You say, مَضَى عَلَى وَجْهِهِ بِغَيْرِ رَوِيَّةٍ [He
went at random, heedlessly, or in a headlong
manner, without consideration]. (A in art. ركب.)
See رَاوِيَةٌ, near the end. [See also رَوِيْئَةٌ in art.
روأ.)
رَجُلٌ رَوَّآءٌ A man whose habitual work, or occupation, is the drawing of water by means of the

habitual drawer of water by means of the راوية
came]. (T.)

of anything. (T.) One says of a woman, إِنَّهَا
لَطَيِّبَةُ الرَّيَّا, meaning Verily she is sweet in the
odour of her body: and hence the saying of Imrael-Keys,
إِذَا قَامَتَا تَضَوَّعَ المِسْكُ مِنْهُمَا
نَسِيمَ الصَّبَا جَآءَتْ بِرَيَّا القَرَنْفُلِ
[When they stand, the fragrance of musk is diffused from them, like the breath of the east wind
that has brought the sweet odour of the clove].
(T.)
-A2-  It is also fem. of رَيَّانُ. (T, S, M, &c.)
رَيَّانُ [originally رَوْيَانُ] an epithet from رَوِىَ;
(T, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) Satisfied with drinking
[of water and of milk &c.]; having drunk [thereof]
enough to quench, or satisfy, his thirst; contr. of
عَطْشَانُ: (S, Mgh: *) fem. رَيَّا, (T, S, M, Mgh,
Msb, K,) in which the ى is not changed into و
because the word is an epithet; for it is changed
into و only in a subst., of the measure فَعْلَى, of
which ى is the final radical, as in تَقْوَى; so that
if it were a subst., it would be رَوَّى; (S, M;)
originally رَوْيَا: (M:) as to رَيَّا that is thought
to be used as the proper name of a woman, it is,
thus used, an epithet, like الحَارِثُ and العَبَّاسُ,
though without the article ال: (S, * M:) the pl.
is روَآءٌ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) with kesr and
medd., (S,) in measure like كِتَابٌ, (Msb,) masc.
and fem. (Mgh, Msb.) You say قَوْمٌ رِوَآءٌ مِنَ المَآءِ
[A people, or party, satisfied with drinking of
water]. (S.) ―

[A plant, or herbage, and trees, having plentiful
irrigation: or flourishing and fresh, luxuriant,
juicy, succulent, or sappy, by reason of plentiful
irrigation: see the verb]. (M.) ―
-b3-  [Hence,]
رَيَّانُ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  Full of fat and flesh. (JM.)
And you say وَجْهٌ رَيَّانُ (tropical:)  [A plump face]; an expression of dispraise [app. when relating to a
man, but not otherwise; for رَيَّانُ, or رَيَّا, applied
to a youth, or to a woman, or a limb of a woman,
meaning plump and juicy, is used by way of
praise]: opposed to وَجْهٌ ظَمْآنُ. (A and TA in
art. ظمأ.) And اِمْرَأَةٌ رَيَّا المُخَلْخَلِ (assumed tropical:)  [A woman
full, or plump, in the place of the anklet]. (JM.)
And فَرَسٌ رَيَّانُ الظَّهْرِ (assumed tropical:)  A horse fat in the portion
of flesh and sinew next the back-bone on each
side. (T.)
رَاوٍ [as the act. part. n. of رَوَى] is used in relation to water [as meaning Bringing, or one who
brings, water to his family: and drawing, or one
who draws, water for others: and a camel carrying, or that carries, water; whence the subst.
رَاوِيَةٌ, q. v.]. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  And [hence] it is used
also in relation to poetry (T, S, M) and to traditions or narratives or stories (T, M, Mgh, K) [as
meaning A relater, reciter, or rehearser, by heart,
of poetry, and of traditions, or narratives or stories,
learned, or heard, or received, from another]: and
in like manner ↓ رَاوِيَةٌ, but in an intensive sense
[as meaning a large, or copious, relater or reciter
or rehearser, &c.]; (T, S, M, Mgh, K;) i. e.
كَثِيرُ الرِّوَايَةِ; (T, * TA;) as in the phrase رَجُلٌ
رَاوِيَةٌ لِلشِّعْرِ [a man who is a large, or copious,
relater &c. of poetry]: (S:) the pl. of رَاوٍ is رُوَاةٌ.
(S, TA.)
-A2-  Also One who has the superintendence, management, or care, of horses (مَنْ يَقُومُ
عَلَى الخَيْلِ [strangely rendered by Freytag, who
seems to have read عَلَى الجَمَلِ, “constrictus fune
et stans super cameli dorso ”]). (M, K.)
رَاوِيَةٌ A camel, (A 'Obeyd, T, S, K,) or a mule,
or an ass, (S, and so in the K with the exception
of “ and ” for “ or,”) upon which water is drawn:
(A 'Obeyd, T, S, K: [see سَانِيَةٌ:]) or a camel that
carries water; (M, * Mgh, Msb;) and then applied
to any beast upon which water is drawn: (Msb:)

proper signification, or whether it be secondary
or tropical, as will be shown by what follows:]
and also a man who draws water (A 'Obeyd, T,
TA) for his family: (TA:) the ة is affixed
[لِلنَّقْلِ, i. e. for the purpose of transferring the
word from the category of epithets to that of substantives; or] to give intensiveness to the signification: (Msb:) pl. رَوَايَا [by rule رَوَآءٍ, being
originally of the measure فَوَاعِلُ, not فَعَائِلُ]. (S,
M, TA.) Also A مَزَادَة [or leathern water-bag]
(A 'Obeyd, T, S, M, Mgh) composed of three skins,
(Mgh,) containing water; (M, K;) so called as
being the receptacle in which is the water borne
by the camel [thus called]; (A 'Obeyd, T;) or the
مزادة is thus termed by the vulgar, but this
application of the word is allowable as metaphorical: (S:) or it signifies a pair of such
water-bags (مَزَادَتَانِ [see مَزَادَةٌ in art. زيد]): (T:)
[accord. to ISd,] it is applied to the مزادة, and
then to the camel, because of the nearness of the
latter to the former: (M:) or its primary application is to the camel: (S, Mgh:) accord. to some,
its application to the camel is proper; and to the
مزادة, tropical: accord. to others, the reverse is
the case: (MF, TA:) the pl. is رَوَايَا, as above.
(Mgh, TA.) ―
-b2-  One says of a weak person who
is in easy circumstances, مَا يَرُدُّ الرَّاوِيَةَ, meaning
He is unable to turn back the راوية [or camel
bearing a water-bag or pair of water-bags,] notwithstanding its being heavily burdened by the
water that is upon it. (M.) ―
-b3-  And the Prophet
applied the appellation رَوَايَا البِلَادِ [The camels
bearing water for the irrigation of the countries,
or the water-bags borne by camels for the irrigation of the countries,] to (assumed tropical:)  the clouds, by way of
comparison. (TA.) ―
-b4-  رَوَايَا is also applied as an
appellation to (assumed tropical:)  The chiefs of a people; (IAar,
Th, T;) as pl. of رَاوِيَةٌ; the chief who bears the
burden of the bloodwits owed by the tribe being
likened to the camel thus termed. (T, M. *) A
Temeemee, mentioning a party that had attacked
his tribe, said, لَقِينَاهُمْ فَقَتَلْنَا الرَّوَايَا وَ أَبَحْنَا الزَّوَايَا
meaning [We encountered them, and] we slew the
chiefs, and gave permission to occupy, or to
plunder, the houses, or tents. (T.) ―
-b5-  رَوَايَا also
occurs in a trad., in which it is said, شَرُّ الرَّوَايَا
رَوَايَا الكَذِبِ, and accord. to some, it is, in this
instance, pl. of رَاوِيَةٌ (JM, TA) in the first of the
senses explained above; so that the meaning is,
(assumed tropical:)  The worst of those who carry tidings are those
who carry false tidings; such persons being
likened to the beasts so called, in respect of the
fatigue that they undergo: (JM:) or it is pl. of
↓ رَوِيَّةٌ; (JM, TA;) and the meaning is, the worst
of thoughts are those that are untrue, not right,
nor tending to good: or it is pl. of ↓ رِوَايَةٌ; and
the meaning is, the worst of relations, or recitals, are those that are untrue. (JM.) ―
-b6-  See
also رَاوٍ.

former of which is also called عَنْزٌ, and the latter
وَعِلٌ; (AZ, T, Msb;) and which are of the [kind

(El-Ahmar, A 'Obeyd, T, S, M, Msb, K,) of the
measure أَفْعَلُ, (S, M, Msb,) erroneously held by
Abu-l-'Abbás to be of the measure فَعْلَى; (M;)
an irregular pl.; (Msb, K;) or [rather] it is a
quasi-pl. n.; (M, K;) and أَرَوِىُّ is a broken pl.
(M.) It is also a proper name of a woman: and
so is ↓ أَرْوَى. (S.)
