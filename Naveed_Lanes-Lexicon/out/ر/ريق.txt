رَيْقٌ A shining, or glistening, (K, TA,) of a
sword [&c.]. (TA.) Hence, in a trad. respecting
[the battle of] Bedr, فَإِذَا بِرَيْقِ سَيْفٍ مِنْ وَرَائِى
[And lo, the shining, or glistening, of a sword behind me]: thus written by El-Wákidee: if the
reading بَرِيقُ [from بَرَقَ] had been transmitted, it
would be evidently reasonable. (IAth, TA.) ―
-b2-
And i. q. بَاطِلٌ [as meaning False, or vain, speech

رِيقٌ Saliva; syn. رُضَابٌ; (S, K, TA;) i. e.
(TA) the water of the mouth; (JK, Msb, K,
TA;) its لُعَاب: (TA:) or the water of the mouth
in the early morning, or first part of the day;
(Lth, TA: [but this rendering is often inapplicable:]) or the water of the mouth while it is
therein; for when it has gone forth from the
mouth it is termed بُصَاقٌ and بُزَاقٌ and بُسَاقٌ: (K
in art. بصق:) and ↓ رِيقَةٌ signifies the same, in
poetry: (Msb, TA:) or this has a more particular
meaning; (S, Msb, * K;) [i. e. it means somewhat
of saliva; or a little saliva:] the pl. is أَرْيَاقٌ [a
pl. of pauc.] (S, K, TA) and رِيَاقٌ [a pl. of mult.].
(TA.) [Hence,] one says, أَبْلِعْنِى رِيقِى [Suffer
thou me to swallow my saliva;] give thou me time
to swallow my saliva: (K and TA in art. بلع:)
or (assumed tropical:)  grant thou me some delay, or let me alone for
a while, that I may say, or do, such a thing.

his saliva: meaning (assumed tropical:)  he restrained his anger:
see 1 in art. بلع.] And شُرِبَ عَلَى الرِّيقِ [It was
drunk in the state of fasting; before breakfast]:
(S, K:) and in like manner أُكِلَ [It was so
eaten]. (K.) And هُوَ عَلَى الرِّيقِ, (AO, S, K,)

-b2-
Also Strength: and the remains of life, or of the
spirit, or of the soul: syns. قُوَّةٌ and رَمَقٌ [which
latter, it should be observed, has both of these
meanings, so that possibly only the former meaning may be here intended]. (K.) You say,
كَانَ هٰذَا الأَمْرُ وَبِنَا رِيقٌ This event happened when
there was in us strength. (TA.)
[
رَيْقَةٌ, accord. to Freytag, as occurring in the
Deewán El-Hudhaleeyeen, signifies The beginning of youth: but perhaps this may be a mistake,
occasioned by some one's saying that the beginning of youth is termed ريقه, meaning رَيْقُهُ.]

-b2-  ذو الريقة is said by Z to be
the name of a sword of Murrah Ibn-Rabee'ah.

رَيِّقٌ: see رِيقٌ, in two places.

of anything, as, for instance, of youth, and of
rain. (S.) [The first and second are also mentioned in art. روق, q. v. J cites here, and ascribes
to Lebeed, as an ex. of the second of these words,
a verse which I have cited in the third paragraph
of art. عرض, but with رَوْقَ in the place of رَيْقَ,
from the TA, in which it is ascribed to ElBa'eeth.]
رَيُّوقٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
تِرْيَاقٌ, said in the T to be so called because
containing the saliva of serpents, is explained in
art. ترق. (TA.)
مَرَاقٌ [app. a n. of place from رَاقَ having for
its aor. يَرِيقُ said of water; though anomalous;
for by rule it should be مَرِيقٌ;] The part, of the
throat, which is the place of passage of the water.
(T and TA in art. درأ: see the last sentence of the
first paragraph of that art.)
مُرَيَّقٌ One in whom a thing ceases not to induce
wonder, or admiration, and pleasure, or joy; or
whom a thing ceases not to please, or rejoice:
(K:) occurring in a verse of Ru-beh: but Sgh
says that it should by rule be مُرَوَّقٌ. (TA.)
