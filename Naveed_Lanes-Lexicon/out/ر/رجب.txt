رَجَبٌ One of the [Arabian] months; (Msb;)
[namely, the seventh thereof;] so called because
of the honour in which it was held in the Time of
Ignorance, (S, A, * K, *) inasmuch as war, or
fighting, during it was held unlawful: (S:) in a
trad., (TA,) it is called رَجَبُ مُضَرَ [Rejeb of
Mudar], because Mudar most honoured it: (S,
TA:) and it is further distinguished as being
between جَمَادَى and شَعْبَان, to show that what
is meant by it is not what the [pagan] Arabs
called رجب according to the computation founded
upon postponement; for they used to postpone
it from month to month: (TA:) [it is also called
رَجَبٌ الفَرْدُ Rejeb the separate; because it is the
only sacred month that is not preceded nor followed by another sacred month; the other sacred
months being المُحَرَّمُ and ذُو القَعْدَةِ and ذُو
الحَجَّةِ:] the pl. is أِرْجَابٌ (S, Msb, K) and أَرْجِبَةٌ
and أَرْجُبٌ [all pls. of pauc.] (Msb) and رُجُوبٌ
and رِجَابٌ and رَجَبَاتٌ (Msb, K) and رَجُوبٌ [or
rather this last is a quasi-pl. n.] (TA) and [pl.
pl.] أَرَاجِبُ [pl. of أَرْجُبٌ] and أَرَاجِيبُ [pl. of
أَرْجَابٌ]. (Msb.) The dual, رَجَبَانِ, (S, Msb,) or
الرَّجَبَانِ, (A,) [The two Rejebs] is applied to [the
two months] رَجَبٌ and شَعْبَانُ, (S, A, Msb,) by
the attribution of predominance to the former.
(Msb.)
-A2-  See also أَرْجَابٌ.
رُجْبَةٌ A thing by means of which a tree is
propped up, because of the abundance of its
fruit, lest its branches should break: sometimes
it is a wall built for it to rest upon, because of its
weakness: (S:) a wall, or the like, built round a
palm-tree, for it to rest upon, because of its
heaviness or its weakness: (Mgh in art. عرو and
عرى:) a kind of wide bench of stone or brick
(دُكَّانٌ) built at the foot of a palm-tree, for it to
rest upon, (K, TA,) because of its leaning, and
being valuable to its owner, and being weak:

which a palm-tree is supported by means of forked
pieces of wood: (TA:) it is also called رُجْمَةٌ:

رَاجِبٌ One who honours his lord, chief, or
master. (AA, TA.)
رَاجِبَةٌ sing. of رَوَاجِبُ; (S, K;) or, accord. to
Kr, the sing. of this latter is ↓ رُجْبَةٌ [also mentioned as a sing. in the K]; but the correctness of this is doubted: (TA:) the رواجب are
The finger-joints that are next to the ends of
the fingers: (S, K:) next to these are the بَرَاجِم:
then, the أَشَاجِع, which are next to the كَفّ:
(S:) or the joints of the lowest parts (أُصُول) of
the fingers: (K: [by which is meant the same as
by the former explanation, accord. to the TA;
though this seems to be more than doubtful:])
or the inner sides of those joints: or the bones of
the fingers: (K:) or the finger-joints: (A, K:)
or the backs of the سُلَامَيَات [generally meaning
the phalanges of the fingers]: or the parts of the
سُلَامَيَات between the بَرَاجِم; (K;) which last
word [commonly signifies the knuckles, and] is
explained by IAar as signifying the wrinkled
parts at the joints of the fingers; whereof each
finger has three, except the thumb: or the
رواجب are the parts, of the inner sides, between
the finger-joints: or [the knuckles next the metacarpal bones; i. e.] the parts that protuberate at
the roots of the fingers when the hand is clinched.
