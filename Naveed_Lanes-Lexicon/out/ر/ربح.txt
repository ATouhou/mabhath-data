market in [or for] his traffic. (Az, Msb.)
-A2-
اربحهُ He gave him gain, or profit: (Mgh, Msb:)
↓ ربّحهُ we have not heard; (Mgh;) [i. e.] رَبَّحْتُهُ
as meaning I gave him gain, or profit, has not
been transmitted [from the Arabs of classical
times]. (Msb.) You say, أَرْبَحْتُهُ عَلَى سِلْعَتِهِ,
(S,) or عَلَيْهَا ↓ رَابَحْتُهُ, (A, K,) or both, (TA,) I
gave him a gain, or profit, upon his commodity.
(S, A, K, TA.) And اربحهُ بِمَتَاعِهِ [He made him

رِبْحٌ and ↓ رَبَحٌ and ↓ رَبَاحٌ [all originally inf. ns.]
Gain, or profit; (IAar, S, A, K, and Mgh in explanation of the first and last;) increase [obtained]
in traffic; (TA;) excess, or surplus, [obtained,]
above the capital [expended]; wherefore it is also
termed شِفٌّ. (Ksh and Bd in explanation of the
first in ii. 15.) [Hence,] ↓ البِرُّ خَيْرُ تِجَارَةٍ رَبَاحًا
(tropical:)  [Piety is the best traffic in respect of gain, or
profit.] (A.)
رَبَحٌ: see the next preceding paragraph. ―
-b2-
Horses and camels that are brought from one
place to another for sale. (K.) ―
-b3-  And Fat, as
a subst. (S, K.) A poet says, (S,) namely,
Khufáf Ibn-Nudbeh, (TA,)
قَرَوْا أَضْيَافَهُمْ رَبَحًا بِبُحٍّ
يعِيشُ بِفَضْلِهِنَّ الحَىُّ سُمْرِ
[as though meaning They entertained their guests
with fat, on the superabundant remains of which
the tribe lived, by means of tawny-coloured
gaming-arrows whereby the lots that determined
who should afford the entertainment were divided]:
(S, * TA:) but [this is inconsistent with the affixed
pronoun relating to ربحا, wherefore], in this case,
as some say, (S, TA,) it means young weaned
camels; (S, K, TA;) [as a quasi-pl. n.;] and its
sing. is ↓ رَابِحٌ; (K;) like as that of حَرَسٌ is
حَارِسٌ; and that of خَادِمٌ خَدَمٌ: (TA:) or a
young weaned camel; [like رُبَحٌ;] and its pl. is
رِبَاحٌ: (K:) or it means here the gain, or profit,
obtained by means of the game called الَميْسِر.
(S, TA.) ―
-b4-  See also the next paragraph.
رُبَحٌ A young weaned camel; (S, K:) app. a
dial. var. of رُبَعٌ. (S.) [See also رَبَحٌ and رُبَّاحٌ.]
―
-b2-  A lamb, or kid: (ISd, TA in art. نصح:) or
the latter: (K;) as also ↓ رُبَّاحٌ. (IAar, K.) ―
-b3-
See also رُبَّاحٌ, first sentence. ―
-b4-  Also A certain
bird, (S, K,) resembling the رَامِج [which is an
owl employed for catching hawks]: or, accord. to
Kr, the word is ↓ رَبَحٌ, and signifies a certain
bird resembling the زَاغ[or rook]. (TA.)
رَبَاحٌ: see رِبْحٌ in two places.
-A2-  Also A certain
small animal, resembling the cat. (So in many
copies of the S.) F observes that J says, الرَّبَاحُ
دُوَيْبَّةٌ يُجْلَبُ مِنْهَا الكَافُورُ; and that بَلَدٌ has been
substituted as an amendment for دويبّة in some of
the copies [of the S]; but that each of these
readings is erroneous: for يجلب we find [in
copies of the S] in the handwriting of Aboo-Zekereeyà and that of Aboo-Sahl يُحْلَبُ, with
the unpointed ح; and the substitution of بلد for
دويبَة was made by IKtt: in the copies of the S,
moreover, we find مِنْهُ instead of مِنْهَا: and IB
says that the passage in J's original copy, in his
own handwriting, runs thus: الرَّبَاحُ أَيْضًا دُوَيْبَّةٌ
كَالسِّنَّورِ يُجْلَبُ مِنْهُ الكَافُورُ. (TA.) [But I find
that, in five copies of the S, between السنّور and
يجلب, occur the words وَالرَّبَاحُ أَيْضًا بَلَدٌ, or بَلْدَةٌ
or اسْمُ بَلَدٍ: and I think it most probable that J
intended to have introduced these or similar words,
and therefore wrote مِنْهُ instead of مِنْهَا; meaning
that رباح is the appellation of a certain small
animal, resembling the cat: and that الرباح is
also the name of a country or town from which
camphor is brought: this country or town is said
in a marginal note in a copy of the S to be in
India.]
رُبَاحٌ: see رُبَّاحٌ.
رَبِيحٌ: see رَابِحٌ.
رَبَاحِىٌّ A certain kind of camphor: (K:) so
called in relation to a certain country, or town,
agreeably with what is [said to have been] asserted
by J, or to a certain king named رَبَاحٌ, who applied his mind to this kind of camphor, and discovered it. (TA.)
رُبَّاحٌ (A' Obeyd, S, A, L, K) and ↓ رُبَاحٌ, (A, TA,)
the latter of the dial. of El-Yemen, (TA,) and
↓ رُبَحٌ, (L, TA,) The male ape; (S, A, L, K;)
[simia caudata, clunibus nudis: (Forskål, "Descr.
Animalium" &c., p. iii.:)] or the young one of
an ape: (TA:) or apes [as a coll. gen. n.]:
(TA in art. نصح, in explanation of the last,
which is there said to be originally رُبَاحٌ:) pl. of
the first رَبَابِيحُ. (TA.) One says أَمْلَحُ مِنْ رُبَّاحٍ
and رُبَاحٍ, meaning [Prettier] than the ape. (A,
TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] رُبُّ رُبَّاحٍ (Lth, A, K) or
رُبَاحٍ (A) A sort of dates (Lth, A, K) of ElBasrah. (Lth.) ―
-b3-  Also, (K,) accord. to some,
(TA,) رُبَّاحٌ signifies A small young weaned camel,
(K,) and small young camels, syn. حَاشِيَةٌ, (TA,)
slender in the bones and meagre in the body:
(K:) but A Heyth asks, How can it mean small
young weaned camels, seeing that a poet applies
to it the epithet ثَنِىّ, and the ثنىّ is five years
old? and Khidásh Ibn-Zuheyr, in a verse cited
by Sh, speaks of a ربّاح breathing hard in labour,
in order that her young one might come forth.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  See also رُبَحٌ.
مَتْجَرٌ رَابِحٌ and ↓ رَبِيحٌ (tropical:)  Trafficking in which
one makes gain, or profit; (TA;) and so تِجَارَةٌ
رَابِحَةٌ; (T, S, A, * Msb, K;) [lucrative, or profitable, traffic;] a phrase like لَيْلٌ نَائِمٌ and سَاهِرٌ
meaning "a night in which one sleeps" and "in
which one is wakeful:" (Az, TA:) and بَيْعٌ
↓ مُرْبِحٌ a sale in which one makes gain, or profit.
(TA.) And مَالٌ رَابِحٌ (assumed tropical:)  Property having gain,
or profit: رابح in this case being like لَابِنٌ and
تَامِرٌ: occurring in a trad.: but some read [رَائِحٌ,
or, more probably, رَائِجٌ, from رَاجَ,] with ى [or
rather ء]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also رَبَحٌ.
مُرْبِحٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
