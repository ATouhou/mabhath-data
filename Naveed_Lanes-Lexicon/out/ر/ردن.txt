رَدِنَ, inf. n. رَدْنٌ, She (a woman) spun thread with
the مِرْدَن: see رَدَنٌ:] الرَّدْنُ and الغَزْلُ are nearly
the same [in meaning]. (Ham p. 218. [Hence
مَرْدُونٌ applied to spun thread.]) ―
-b2-  [And app.
She wove a garment, or piece of cloth, with spun
thread such as is termed مَرْدُونٌ, or رَدَنٌ: whence

cloth.] ―

shoulder: but see what follows:] the fore part of
the sleeve of the shirt: (M:) or the lower part
thereof: (M, and Har pp. 149 and 390:) or the
sleeve altogether: (M:) and it may tropically
mean the whole garment: (Har p. 390:) pl.
أَرْدَانٌ. (S, M, K. [In the TA is added, and
اردنة; as though another pl. were أَرْدِنَةٌ: but I
think that this is a mistake, originating in a copy
of the M; for, immediately after أَرْدَانٌ, in the M,
is added, وَأَرْدَنَهُ جَعَلَ لَهُ أَرْدَانًا; and I suspect that
in some copy thereof, واردنه has been inadvertently written twice.]) You say قَمِيصٌ وَاسِعُ الرُّدْنِ
[A shirt wide in the ردن]. (S.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
one says, هُوَ دَنِسُ الأَرْدَانِ (tropical:)  [meaning He is foul
in character, conduct, or the like; for it is tropical]. (A in art. دنس. [See, there, other similar
phrases.])

moving the hand] forwards [upon the spindle
against the thigh]: or spun thread that is مَنْكُوس
[i. e. twisted in a manner the reverse of that
which is usual: see شَزْرٌ]: thread spun with the
مِرْدَن. (M. [See مَرْدُونٌ.]) ―
-b2-  And [Cloth of
the kind termed] خَزّ: (AA, T, S, M, K, and
Ham p. 218:) or yellow خَزّ: (AA, T:) or what
is woven from what women spin with the مِرْدَن
(مما تردنه النساء): (Ham ubi suprà: [see, again,
مَرْدُونٌ:]) or silk; i. q. قَزٌّ; (M;) or حَرِيرٌ. (TA.)
―
-b3-  And The [membrane called] غِرْس [q. v.] that
comes forth with the young (S, K, TA) from the

-b4-
See also رَادِنٌ.
رُمْحٌ رُدَيْنِىٌّ [meaning A well-straightened spear;
lit. a spear of Rudeyneh]: and قَنَاةٌ رُدَيْنِيَّةٌ [the
same, or a well-straightened spear-shaft]: (S:)
and رِمَاحٌ رُدَيْنِيَّةٌ [well-straightened spears]: (M:)
accord. to their [the Arabs'] assertion, (S,) so
called in relation to a woman named Rudeyneh,
(S, M,) wife of Es-Semharee [or Semhar]; both
of whom used to straighten spears, or spear-shafts,
in Khatt-Hejer: and some say ↓ خَطِّيَّةٌ رُدْنٌ [wellstraightened spears of El-Khatt], and رِمَاحٌ رُدْنٌ.
(S.) [See an ex. in a verse cited in art. ذوق,
6th conj.]
رَادِنٌ Saffron; (S, K;) as also ↓ رَدَنٌ. (Sgh,
TA in art. شعر.)
أَحْمَرُ رَادِنِىٌّ A camel, (As, T,) or a thing, (S,)
of which the redness is mixed with yellowness,
(As, T, S, K,) like وَرْس [q. v.]: (As, T:) hence
the epithet رَادِنِىٌّ is applied to a he-camel, (S,
TA,) and with ة to a she-camel: (As, T, S:) or
رَادِنِىٌّ is applied to a he-camel as meaning having
crisp, or curly, fur, of generous race, (Lth, T,
M,) beautiful, (Lth, T,) and inclining a little to
blackness: (Lth, T, M:) or intensely red; (TA,
and Ham p. 218;) or it has this meaning also:
(M:) or between yellow and red: accord. to some,
from رَادِنٌ signifying “ saffron; ” (Ham ubi suprà;)
but As says, I know not in relation to what thing
the camel is called by this epithet. (M.) They
said also أَرْمَكُ رَادِنِىٌّ [i. e. Intensely dun or brown
or dusky &c.]; to denote intensiveness; like as
they said أَبْيَضُ نَاصِعٌ. (IAar, M.)
أَرْدَنُ [or خَزٌّ أَرْدَنُ] A sort of [cloth of the kind
termed] خَزّ, (S, K,) red: (S:) [pl. رُدْنٌ:] and
[hence] ثِيَابٌ رُدْنٌ Red garments or cloths. (So
in one of my copies of the S.)
أُرْدُنٌ, (ISK, T, S, M, and so in some copies of
the K,) in some of the copies of the K erroneously
said to be with the ر musheddedeh, (TA,) [in the
CK with the د, which is also a mistake,] A
drowsiness, or dozing: (S, K:) or an overpowering
drowsiness or dozing: a poet uses the phrase
نَعْسَةٌ أُرْدُنٌّ: (ISk, T:) or this means an intense
drowsiness or dozing: (M:) Yákoot says that it
appears to signify intenseness and an overpowering, because there is no meaning in one's saying
نَعْسَةٌ نَعْسَةٌ. (TA.) It is a word of which no
verb has been heard. (S.) Hence, accord. to ISK,
الأُرْدُنُّ as the name of a certain province; (T;) a
province of Syria, (S, K,) and a river thereof
[i. e. the Jordan]; (S;) also without teshdeed.
(TA.)
مُرْدِنٌ Dark; (S, M, K;) applied to night.
(M.) ―
-b2-  Also, applied to sweat, Stinking: (K:)
or, thus applied, that wets all the skin: (M:)
[or] ↓ مَرْدُونٌ has the latter meaning, thus applied. (T.)
مِرْدَنٌ A spindle (S, M, K) with which [the
thread termed] رَدَن is spun: (M, TA:) pl. مَرَادِنُ.
(TA.)
مَرْدُونٌ is applied as an epithet to غَزْل [i. e.
spun thread, meaning Spun with the مِرْدَن: see
also رَدَنٌ]. (M.) ―
-b2-  Also to a garment, or piece
of cloth, (M,) meaning Woven (Sh, T, M) with
spun thread that is مَرْدُون. (M.) Aboo-Duwád
El-Iyádee says,
أَسْأَدَتْ لَيْلَةً وَيَوْمًا فَلَمَّا
دَخَلَتْ فِى مُسَرْبَخٍ مَرْدُونِ
[She (app. referring to a camel) hastened in her
journey, or journeyed on without stopping to rest,
a night and a day; and when she entered a
desert, or waterless desert, far-extending, wide,
or spacious, woven with the mirage, or overspread by a rippling mirage resembling a web:
or they (i. e. camels) hastened &c.]: Sh says that
مَرْدُون signifies woven: and the poet means, by
مسربخ مردون, a tract of land in which was the
mirage: (T:) or مردون here means woven with
the mirage: (TA in art. سربخ:) or, as some say,
by مردون he means مَرْدُوم, [app. as signifying
conjoined, so as to be uninterrupted, (see رَدَمَ,)]
and has changed the م into ن; and مسربخ
means wide, or spacious: (T:) or مردون signifies
مَوْصُول [which has the meaning that I have
assigned above to مردوم]: (T, K:) so some say.
(T.) ―
-b3-  See also مُرْدِنٌ.
