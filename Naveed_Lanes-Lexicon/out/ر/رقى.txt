رقى1
رَقِىَ, aor. يَرْقَى, inf. n. رُقِىٌّ (JK, K, TA,
[but this inf. n. is omitted in the CK,]) and رَقْىٌ,
(K, TA, [but this is omitted in my MS. copy of
the K,]) He ascended, إِلَيْهِ [to him, or it]; as
also ↓ ارتقى, and ↓ ترقّى: (K:) or he ascended a
ladder, or a stair: (JK:) or رَقِيتُ فِيهِ, (S, Msb,
in the Mgh رَقِىَ فيه,) inf. n. رُقِىٌّ (S, Mgh, Msb)
and رَقْىٌ; (S, Msb;) and ↓ ارتقيت, (S, Mgh, *
Msb,) and ↓ ترقّيت; (Mgh, * Msb;) I ascended
it; (S;) namely, a ladder, or a stair, (S, Mgh,
Msb,) &c.: (Msb:) and رَقِيتُ الجَبَلَ (Msb,)
and السَّطْحَ, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) the verb being
thus trans. by itself, (Msb, TA,) without فِى
(Mgh,) and likewise with فى, (TA,) I ascended,
or mounted, upon the mountain, and upon the
house-top: (Msb:) and ↓ ارتقى is in like manner
trans. without فى; whence the saying, لَقَدِ
صَعْبًا ↓ ارْتَقَيْتَ مُرْتَقًى [Thou hast indeed ascended
a difficult place of ascent]. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
اِرْقَ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ Ascend thou, and go, [according
to thy limping, or halting, i. e.] as far as thou
art able to do so, and impose not upon thyself
that which thou art not able to perform. (S,
TA. [Some, instead of اِرْقَ, say اِرْقَأْ; and some,
اِرْقِ, from the verb mentioned in the next sentence;
and some, ق: see 1 in art. رقأ; and see also art.
ظلع.])
-A2-  رَقَاهُ, (JK, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. يَرْقِى,
(JK, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. رُقْيَةٌ (JK, S, Mgh, K)
and رَقْى (JK, Mgh, Msb, * K) and رُقِىٌّ (K,)
He charmed him, syn. عَوَّذَهُ, (JK, Mgh, Msb,)
by [invoking] God: (Msb:) and (Mgh) he
puffed, or sputtered, upon his charm; syn. نَفَثَ
فِى عُوذَتِهِ: (Mgh, K:) [it signifies he charmed
him from, or against, such a thing; (مِنْ كَذَا;)
and also he enchanted him, or fascinated him;
by uttering a spell; or by tying knots in a thread,
or string, and puffing, or sputtering, upon them;
or by both these actions combined: see the last
chap. but one of the Kur-án:] the epithet applied
to the performer is ↓ رَاقٍ [meaning Charming;
&c.]; (S, Mgh, TA;) and ↓ رَقَّآءٌ [A charmer;
&c.; or one who habitually practises charming;
&c.]: (JK, K, TA:) and the epithet applied to
the person who is the object of the performance
is ↓ مَرْقِىٌّ [meaning Charmed; &c.]. (JK, TA.)
In the saying اِرْقِ عَلَى رَأْسِى مِنَ الصُّدَاعِ, meaning
Charm thou me (عَوِّذْنِى [or rather charm thou
my head against the headache]), the verb is made
trans. by means of على because it is as though it
implied the meaning of اِقْرّأْ [i. e. “ recite thou ”
a spell] and اُنْفُثْ [i. e. “ puff,” or “ sputter,”
upon knots]. (Mgh.)
2
رِقّاهُ, inf. n. تَرْقِيَةٌ, He made him to ascend;
syn. صَعَّدَهُ. (TA.) [See an ex. in a verse of ElAashà cited in art. ثمن, voce ثَمَانُونَ.] ―
-b2-  [And
hence, He elevated, or exalted, him.] ―
-b3-  [Hence
also,] رَقَّى عَلَيْهِ كَلَامًا, inf. n. as above, i. q. رَفَعَ
[meaning He told, or related, a saying against
him; he informed against him; as is indicated by
what next follows, and by a meaning of ترقّى as
quasi-pass. of رقّى thus used]. (S, K.) You say
also, رقّى عَلَى البَاطِلَ, inf. n. as above, He
brought a false accusation against me; said,
against me, what was not the case; and exaggerated [in what he said against me]. (JM,
TA.)

تَرَقَّىَ see 1, first sentence, in two places. ―
-b2-
[Hence,] ترقّى فِىِ العِلْمِ He rose by degrees, or
step by step, in knowledge, or science. (S, TA.)
And hence, مَا زَالَ يَتَرَقَّى بِهِ الحَالُ حَتَّى بَلَغَ غَايَتَهُ
The state, or condition, ceased not to rise with
him until he reached the utmost point thereof.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also, the verb being quasi-pass.
of 2,] ترقّى إِلَيْهِ الخَبَرٌ The news, or information,
came to him, or reached him. (MA.)
6
تراقى [meaning He exalted himself] is
from الرُّقِىُّ signifying الصُّعُودُ and الاِرْتِفَاعُ. (Har
p. 128.)

إِرْتَقَىَ see 1, first sentence, in three places. ―
-b2-
[Hence,] ارتقى بَطْنُهُ His belly became [drawn
up, i. e.] lean, or lank; syn. اِنْطَوَى: said of a
camel, and of a sheep or goat. (JK.)
10
استرقاهُ He asked him, or desired him, to
charm him. (S, * TA.)
رُقْيَةٌ i. q. عُوذَةٌ [as meaning A charm, or spell,
either uttered or written], (K, TA,) by which a
person having an evil affection, such as fever and
epilepsy &c., is charmed: (TA:) when it is in
any other language than that of the Arabs, and
one knows not what is in it, it is disapproved,
lest it should involve enchantment (سِحْر) and
infidelity; but in such as is from the Kur-án or
any of the forms of prayer, there is no harm:
(Mgh in art. تم: [see تَمِيمَةٌ:]) [but عُوذَةٌ generally
signifies “ an amulet to charm the wearer against
the evil eye &c. ”:] 'Orweh says,
فَمَا تَرَكَا مِنْ عُوذَةٍ يَعْرِفَانِهَا
وَلَا رُقْيَةٍ إِلَّا بِهَا رَقَيَانِى
[And they two left not any amulet that they
knew, nor any charm, or spell, but with it they
charmed me]: (TA:) [sometimes, also, it signifies
anything by which one enchants, or fascinates:
and hence it is said,] المَرْأَةُ رُقْيَةٌ [Woman is a
thing by which one is enchanted, or fascinated]:
(Msb:) pl. رُقًى. (S, Msb, K.)
رُقْيَا [The act, or practice, or art, of charming:
and also, of enchanting, or fascinating; i. e.
enchantment, or fascination:] the subst., (Msb,)
of the measure فُعْلَى, from رَقَاهُ, aor. يَرْقِيهِ. (Msb,
TA.)
رُقِيَّةٌ [Ascent; or the act of ascending;] the
subst. from رَقِىَ aor. يَرْقَى. (TA.)
رَقَّآءٌ One who ascends mountains much or often.
(TA.)
-A2-  See also 1, last sentence but one.
رَاقٍ: see 1, last sentence but one. The saying
in the Kur [lxxv. 27], مَنْ رَاقٍ [Who is one that
charms?] means that there is no charmer that
shall charm him and protect him: or, accord. to
I'Ab, the meaning is, who is he that ascendeth
with his soul? shall the angels of mercy [ascend
with it] or the angels of punishment? (TA.) In
the saying of a rájiz,
لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ وَالأَجَلِّ البَاقِى
أَنْ لَنْ يَرُدَّ القَدَرَ الرَّوَاقِى
[the meaning may be, Assuredly thou knowest,
by the Most Majestic, the Everlasting, that
the female charmers will not repel, or avert,
that which is decreed; or, that the potent charmers will not &c.: for] the pl. may be that of
↓ رَاقِيَةٌ as an epithet applied to a woman, or of this
same word as an intensive epithet applied to a
man. (S.)
رَاقِيَةٌ; pl. رَوَاقٍ (with the article الرَّوَاقِى): see
what next precedes.
مَرْقًى A place of ascent; as also ↓ مُرْتَقًى;
(Msb, TA;) and so ↓ مَرْقَاةٌ and ↓ مِرْقَاةٌ: (Msb:)
or ↓ these last two signify a series of steps or
stairs; or a ladder; syn. دَرَجَةٌ; (S, K;) and سُلَّمٌ;
(M and K in art. سلم;) the former of them as
being a place of ascent, and the latter of them
as being likened to an instrument; (S, Msb;)
and both of them are authorized by the M;
(TA;) but the latter of them is disallowed by
A'Obeyd, and said by him to be not of the
language of the Arabs: (Msb, TA:) the pl. of
↓ مِرَقَاةٌ [and of مَرْقًى] is مَرَاقٍ. (TA.) You say
جَبَلٌ لَا مَرْقَى فِيهِ and ↓ لا مُرْتَقَى (JK, TA) A
mountain in which is no place of ascent. (TA.)
مَرْقِيَا الأَنْفِ [in my MS. copy of the K مُرْقِيَا]
The two edges [or alœ] of the nose: (K, TA:)
so says Th; but the expression commonly known
is مَرَقَّا الأَنْفِ, mentioned before [in art. رق]. (TA.)
مَرْقَاةٌ and مِرْقَاةٌ: see مَرْقًى, in four places.
مَرْقِىٌّ: see 1, last sentence but one.
مُرْتَقًى: see مَرْقًى, in two places; and see an
ex. in the first sentence of this article.
