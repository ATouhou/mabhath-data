روم1
رَامَ, (T, S, M, Msb,) aor. يَرُومُ, (T, S, Msb,)
inf. n. رَوْمٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and مَرَامٌ, (Msb, K,
TA,) He sought, sought for or after, or desired,
syn. طَلَبَ, (T, * M, Msb, K, *) a thing. (S, M,
Msb.) ―
-b2-  [And hence, He attempted another
person in fight &c., and a thing.] ―
-b3-  And [hence
also] الرَّوْمُ, (K,) or رَوْمُ الحَرَكَةِ, mentioned by
Sb, (S,) [as though signifying The desiring to
pronounce the vowel-sound without fully accomplishing that desire,] means [the pronouncing]
a vowel-sound (حَرَكَة) slurred (مُخْتَلَسَة) and
rendered obscure, (S, K,) for, or by, [accord. to
different copies of the S,] a sort of alleviation [of
the utterance]; (S;) it is more [in effect] than
what is termed الإِشْمَام, because it is heard; (S,
K;) and it is of the same measure [in prosody]
as the vowel-sound [fully pronounced]; as [in the
case of what is termed] هَمْزَةٌ بَيْنَ بَيْنَ, such as in
the saying of the poet,
أَاَنْ زُمَّ أَجْمَالٌ وَفَارَقَ جِيرَةٌ
وَ صَاحَ غُرَابُ البَيْنِ أَنْتَ حَزِينُ
[Is it because that camels have had the nose-reins
attached to them, and neighbours have separated,
one from another, and the raven of disunion has
uttered its cry, thou art mourning?]; أَاَنْ زُمْ
being scanned as فَعُولُنْ; and it not being allowable to make the ع [in فعولن] quiescent: it is
such also as in the phrase in the Kur [ii. 181]
شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ with him who makes [the dammeh]
obscure; it being only with a slurred vowel-sound
(حَرَكَة مُخْتَلَسَة); and it not being allowable for
the former ر [i. e. the ر of شهر] to be quiescent,
because the ه before it is quiescent, for this would
lead to the combination of two quiescent letters in
a case of continuity, [i. e. when there is no pause
after them,] without there being before them a
soft letter [i. e. ا or و or ى, as in دَوَابّ &c.],
which is not found in any of the dialects of the
Arabs: and it is such also as in the instances in
the Kur [xv. 9 and x. 36 and xxxvi. 49] إِنَّا نَحْنُ
نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ and أَمَّنْ لَا يَهِدِّى and يَخِصِّمُونَ [for
يَهْتَدِى and يَخْتَصِمُونَ], and the like thereof:
no regard should be paid to the saying of Fr, that
in this [last] and the like instances a letter [which
in this instance and in the next preceding it
is ت] is incorporated into another [following it];
for they [i. e. the Arabs] do not realize this mode
[of incorporation]; and he who combines two
quiescent letters in an instance in which the
slurring of the vowel-sound (اِخْتِلَاسُ الحَرَكَةِ) is
not proper errs; as in the reading of Hamzeh, in
the Kur [xviii. 96], فَمَا اسطَّاعُوا; for the س of
الاِسْتِفْعَالُ may not be made movent in any
manner [and therefore it may not be incorporated
into the following letter]. (S, TA.) الرَّوْمُ is [also]
in a case of pausing after a word ending with any
letter except the fem. ة, [in like manner] meaning
The indicating the vowel with an obscure sound:
(I' Ak p. 351:) رَوْمُ الحَرَكَةِ in pausing after a
word that is مَرْفُوع or مَجْرُور is from رَامَ الشَّىْءَ
signifying طَلَبَهُ: Sb says that those of whom one
says رَامُوا الحَرَكَةَ [They slurred the vowel-sound]
are induced to do what this signifies [instead of
suppressing the vowel-sound entirely] by eagerness to exclude it from the case of that which is
necessarily made quiescent in every instance, and
to show that its case is, in their opinion, not like
the case of that which is made quiescent in every
instance. (M.) [See also 4 in art. شور.]

روّم فُلَانًا (Msb, K) followed by الشَّىْءَ,
(Msb,) and (K) روّم بِفُلَانٍ, (IAar, S, K,) He

desire, the thing. (IAar, S, Msb, K.) ―

رَأْيَهُ He meditated, intended, purposed, desired,
or endeavoured, to do one thing after another.
(K.)
-A2-  And روّم He tarried; paused; tarried

Quasi 4. أَرَمْتَ, for أَرْمَمْتَ: see the latter, near
the end of the first paragraph of art. رم.

رَامٌ A certain species of trees. (S, K. *)
رَوْمٌ inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (T, S, M, &c.)

-A2-  الرُّومُ A certain nation,
(M, K,) well known; (M;) [said by the Arabs
to be] descendants of Er-Room, the son of Esau
(عيصُو [so called by the Arabs]), (T, * S, K,) the
son of Isaac the Prophet; (TA;) [i. e. the
Greeks; generally meaning, of the Lower Empire; but sometimes, only those of Asia; and
sometimes those of the Lower Empire together
with all the nations of Europe beside: the ancient
Greeks are more properly called by the Arabs
اليُونَانُ:] one says ↓ رُومِىٌّ and رُومٌ; (S, K;) the
former of these two appellations being applied to
a single person, (M, K,) and the latter being
the pl., (S, K,) [or rather a coll. gen. n.,] like
زِنْجِىٌّ and زِنْجٌ; (AAF, S, M;) the former being
distinguished from the latter only by the doubled
ى, like as تَمْرَةٌ is distinguished from تَمْرٌ its pl.
[or coll. gen. n.] only by the ة: (S:) and رُومِىٌّ
has for [its proper] pl. ↓ أَرْوَامٌ. (TA.) [It is also
applied to The country of the nation, or people, so
called, both in Europe and Asia, and sometimes
only in Asia. Hence, بَحْرُ الرُّومِ The Sea of the
Greeks; meaning the Mediterranean Sea.]
رُومَةٌ Glue, with which the feathers of an arrow
are stuck: (M, K:) said by A'Obeyd to be [thus]
without ء; but mentioned by Th with ء. (M,
TA. [See art. رأم.])

that of a full ship is called مُرْبِعٌ. (AA, T.)
-A2-

رَائِمٌ: see what next precedes.
أَرْوَامٌ pl. of رُومِىٌّ. (TA.) See رُومٌ.
مَرَامٌ i. q. مَطْلَبْ (S, M, K) [accord. to the PS
A place of seeking or searching: but it should be
observed that مَطْلَبٌ is an inf. n., and also a n. of
place and of time: also that مَرَامٌ is expressly said
in the Msb and TA to be an inf. n. of رَامَ, though
not in the S nor in the M: and that it is mentioned in the K in the beginning of this art. as
syn. with رَوْمٌ in the sense of طَلَبٌ, and at the end
of the art. as signifying the same as مَطْلَبٌ]. One
says, هُوَ ثَبْتُ المَقَامِ بَعِيدُ المَرَامِ [which may mean
He is firm, or steady, in respect of the place of
standing; far-aiming in respect of the place of
seeking: or, agreeably with an explanation voce
ثَبْتٌ, he is one who does not quit his station, or
abode, without necessity, though far-aiming &c.:
but it is obvious that both المقام and المرام may
here be inf. ns.]. (TA.)
مَرُومٌ Sought, sought for or after, or desired.
(Msb.)
