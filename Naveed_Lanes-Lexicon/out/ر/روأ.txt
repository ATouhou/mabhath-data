روأ2
روّأ فِى الأَمْرِ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,)
inf. n. تَرْوِئَةٌ, (S, Mgh, K,) or تَرْوِيَةٌ, (so in one of
my copies of the S,) after the manner of a verb
with an infirm final radical, like تَزْكِيَةٌ, inf. n. of
زَكَّى, (TA,) and تَرْوِىْءٌ, (S, K,) agreeably with
analogy; (TA;) and, accord. to IDrst, in his
Expos. of the Fs, رَوَّى also is allowable; but the
former is the original; or, accord. to the L, the
former is anomalous, like حَلَّأْتُ in the phrase
حَلَّأْتُ السَّوِيقَ; (TA;) He looked into the thing,
or affair, or case; inspected it; examined it;
considered it; or thought upon it; (S, M, Mgh,
Msb, K;) and thought upon it repeatedly; syn.
تَعَقَّبَهُ; (M, L, K, TA;) i. e. رَدَّدَ فِيهِ فِكْرَهُ; (TA;)
not hastening to reply: (S, K:) and رَيَّأَ signifies
the same; (K in art. ريأ;) i. q. فَكَّرَ; (T;) or,
accord. to some, it is a mispronunciation. (MF.)

-b2-  Hence, يَوْمُ التَّرْوِيَةِ The eighth day of [the
month] Dhu-l-Hijjeh; originally with ء: its
derivation from الرُّؤْيَةُ is a mistake; and its derivation from الرِّىُّ requires consideration. (Mgh.)
[See 2 in art. روى.]

أَرْوَأَ It (a place) abounded with the [kind of
plant, or tree, called] رَآء: (AZ, AAF, K:) or so
أَرْوَأَتْ, said of land (أَرْض). (M.)
رَآءٌ A kind of [plant, or] tree, (T, * S, M, K,
&c.,) that grows in plain, or soft, land, (T, M,
TA,) having a white fruit: or, as some say, a
kind of dust-coloured tree, having a red fruit:
(M, TA:) n. un. رَآءَةٌ: (T, S, M, K:) and dim.
↓ رُوَيْئَةٌ: (M, TA:) AHn says that the رآءة is not
taller nor broader than a sitting man: and
accord. to one of the Arabs of the desert of
'Omán, it is a tree that rises on a stem, and then
there branch forth [so in the M, but accord. to
the TA, rise,] from it round, rough leaves:
others, he adds, say that it is a small tree of the
mountains, resembling an عظلمة [q. v.], having a
soft white flower like cotton: (M, TA: [but in
the latter, the word rendered “ soft ” is omitted:])
some say that it is a species of the kind of tree
called طَلْح [acacia, or mimosa, gummifera], and
is the tree that grew at the cave in which were the
Prophet and Aboo-Bekr: so say Suh and others:
it is, they say, of the height of a man, and has
white flowers, resembling cotton, with which
cushions are stuffed, like feathers in lightness and
softness: it is said by IHsh to be the same [tree]
that is called أُمُّ غَيْلَان [see art. غيل]; but they
have found fault with him. [for so saying]: it is
not the عُشَر [asclepias gigantea], as one author
has supposed; but a tree resembling this: (MF,
TA:) such is the truth: the رآء is not the عشر: I
have seen them both [says SM] in El-Yemen;
and with the fruit of each of them cushions and
pillows are stuffed: but the fruit of the عشر commences small; then increases to the size of the
باذنجانة [or fruit of the egg-plant, and much
larger, like a bladder]; and then breaks open,
disclosing what is like cotton: and the fruit of
the رآء is not thus: the عشر [he adds] is not found
in Egypt; but it and the رآء are peculiar to El-
Hijáz and the neighbouring parts; [in saying
this, however, he errs; for I have seen the عشر in
abundance in the deserts of the upper part of the
Sa'eed;] and the saddles of camels &c. are stuffed
with the fruit of the رآء in El-Hijáz. (TA.) ―

رَآءَةٌ n. un. of رَآءٌ. (T, S, M, K.)
-A2-  See also
رَايَةٌ, in art. رى.
رَوِيْئَةٌ, or, as some say, only رَوِيَّةٌ, without ء;
(M;) the latter was the usual form, without ء;
(S, Msb;) or each; (K;) a subst. from رَوَّأَ فِى;
الأَمْرِ; (S, K;) meaning Inspection, examination,
consideration, or thought; (S, * M, Msb, K; *) and
repeated inspection or examination or consideration; (M, * Msb, K, * TA;) or consideration of
the issues, or results, of an affair; (Msb;) without haste to reply. (S, * K, * TA.) You say, فُلَانٌ
لَيْسَ لَهُ رَوِيَّةٌ [Such a one has no inspection, &c.].
(T.) It precedes what is termed عَزِيمَةٌ [i. e. resolution, or determination, &c.], and follows what
is termed بَدِيهَةٌ [i. e. intuitive knowledge, &c.]:
one has well said,
بَدِيهَتُهُ تَحُلُّ عُرَى المَعَانِى
إِذَا انْغَلَقَتْ فَتَكْفِيهِ الرَّوِيَّهْ
[His intuitive knowledge undoes the loops of
meanings when they are fast closed, and inspection suffices him]. (Har p. 8.) [See also رَوِيَّةٌ in
art. روى.]
رُوَيْئَةٌ dim. of رَآءٌ, q. v. (M, TA.)
قَصيدَةٌ رَائيَّةٌ and رَاوِيَّةٌ and رَيِّيَّةٌ A قصيدة of which
the رَوِىَّ is ر. (TA in باب الالف الليّنة.)
