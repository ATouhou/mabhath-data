رَجَلَ;
inf. n. [of the former] رِجْلَةٌ and [of the latter]
رِجْلٌ; [so in the CK; but accord. to the rule of
the K they should be رَجْلَةٌ and رَجْلٌ, as neither
is expressly said to be with kesr; or the latter
may be correctly رِجْلٌ, as رَجِلَ is said to be like
عَلِمَ, of which the inf. n. is عِلْمٌ;] He had a
complaint of his رِجْل [i. e. leg, or foot]: (CK;
but omitted in other copies: both mentioned in

S and in the O) I left the young camel with his
mother to such her whenever he pleased: (S, * O:
[in one of my copies of the S رَجَلْتُ, which
appears from what here follows to be a mistake:])

حَتَّى فُطِمَا ↓ مُسَرْهَدٌ أُرْجِلَ
[Fat, and well nourished: he was left with his
mother to such her when he pleased until he was
weaned]. (O.) [See also رَجَلٌ, below; where it

(TA.)
-A5-  [Golius says that رَجُلَ signifies Vir et
virili animo fuit; as on the authority of J; and
that رُجْلَةٌ is its inf. n.: but it seems that he found
الرُّجْلَةُ incorrectly explained in a copy of the S as
مَصْدَرُ رَجُلَ instead of مَصْدَرُ الرَّجُلِ: ISd expressly says that رُجْلَةٌ and its syns. (explained
below) are of the number of those inf. ns. that
have no verbs.]

(Msb, TA;) either his own hair, [see 5,] or that
of another: (Msb:) or he combed down the hair;
i. e., let it down, or made it to hang down, by
means of the comb: (Mgh:) Er-Rághib says, as
though he made it to descend at the رِجْل [or
foot], i. e. from its places of growth; but this
requires consideration: (MF:) or he combed and
anointed the hair: (TA voce عَسِبٌ:) or he washed
and combed the hair. (Ham p. 356.)
4
ارجلهُ He made him to go on foot; (S, K,
TA;) to alight from his beast. (TA.)
-A2-  And
He granted him some delay, or respite; let him

and ترجّلها, (see مُرْتَجِلٌ,)] He put the زند [or
the زندة; (the former meaning the upper, and the
latter the lower, of the two pieces of wood used

or ↓ ارتجل signifies he (a man come from a distant country) struck fire, and held the زَنْد [here
app. meaning (as in many other instances) the
زند properly so called and the زندة] with his
hands and his feet, [i. e. the زند with his hands
and the زندة with his feet,] because he was alone.
(TA. [See مُرْتَجِلٌ.])
-A2-  [ترجّل He became a
رَجُل, or man; he rose to manhood. (See an
explanation of ترجّل النَّهَارُ, in what follows.)
And] ترجّلت She (a woman, TA) became like a

or states, or predicaments. (TA.) ―
-b2-  ترجّل النَّهَارُ
i. q. اِرْتَفَعَ (tropical:)  [i. e. The day became advanced, the
sun being somewhat high]; (S, IAth, O, K, TA;)
it being likened to the rising of a man from
youth; (IAth, TA;) and so النهار ↓ ارتجل: or,
accord. to Er-Rághib, the former means the sun

it alighted (كَأَنَّهَا تَرَجَّلَتْ [in a proper sense of
this verb: see 1, first sentence]). (TA.)
-A3-  And
ترجّل He combed his own hair: (Msb:) or he
combed down his own hair; i. e., let it down,
or made it to hang down, by means of the comb:
(Mgh:) or he anointed [or washed] and combed
his own hair. (TA. [See 2.]) Hence, نَهَى
عَنِ التَّرَجُّلِ إِلَّا غِبًّا (Mgh, TA) He [Mohammad]
forbade the anointing and combing of one's own
hair except it be less frequent than every day.
(TA.)
8

-b2-  Said of a
horse, (in his running, TA,) He mixed the pace
termed العَنَق with that termed الهَمْلَجَة, (T, TA,)

and thus, (S,) he went those two paces alternately,

the latter. (S.)

he began an oration (a خُطْبَة), and poetry, without his having prepared it beforehand; (S;)
he spoke a speech (Msb, K) without consideration or thought, (Msb,) or without his having
prepared it; (K;) he recited it, or related it,
standing, without forecast, consideration, thought,
or meditation; so accord. to Er-Rághib [who
seems to have held this to be the primary signification of the verb when relating to a speech or
the like]; or without reiteration, and without
pausing, halting, or hesitating. (TA.) And
ارتجل الشَّىْءَ [He did, performed, or produced,
the thing without premeditation, or previous

none to take part or share or participate with
him, in his opinion, (Msb, K, TA,) without
consulting any one respecting it, (Msb, TA,) and
kept constantly, or perseveringly, to it. (Msb.)
[Hence,] أَمْرُكَ مَا ارْتَجَلْتَ Thine affair [to which
thou shouldst keep] is that respecting which
thou art alone [&c.] in thine opinion. (K.) And
اِرْتَجِلْ مَا ارْتَجَلْتَ مِنَ الأَمْرِ is explained in the T
as meaning اِرْكَبْ مَا رَكِبْتَ مِنْهُ [i. e. Undertake
thou what thou hast undertaken of the affair:
but it may rather signify keep thou to what thou
hast undertaken of the affair; agreeably with
what here follows]. (TA.) One says also,
↓ اِرْتَجِلْ رَجْلَكَ Keep thou to thine affair: (IAar,

paragraph.

meaning that [limb] with which the man walks:
(Msb:) or the foot of a man [and of a bird, and
the kind foot of a quadruped: or rather it signifies thus in many instances; but generally as
before explained: and sometimes, by a synecdoche, it is used in a yet larger sense, as will be
explained below]: (K:) of the fem. gender:
(Zj, Msb, TA:) pl. أَرْجُلٌ: (S, Msb, K, &c.:)
it has no other pl. (Msb, TA) known to Sb;
(TA;) the pl. of pauc. being also used as a pl. of

الرِّجْلُ جُبَارٌ [The hind leg or foot, or it may here
mean the leg or foot absolutely, is a thing of
which no account, or for which no retaliation or
mulct, is taken]: i. e., if a beast tread upon a

mulct, if in motion; but if the beast be standing

whether it strike with a يَد or a رِجْل. (TA.)
And هُوَ قَائِمٌ عَلَى رِجْلٍ [lit. He is standing upon

binding the udder of a camel, so that the young
one cannot suck, therewith, nor will it undo:
(S, K:) whence the phrase صَرَّ رِجْلَ الغُرَابِ, for
صَرَّ صَرًّا مِثْلَ صَرِّرِجْلِ الغُرَابِ. (TA.) El-Kumeyt
says,
صَرَّ رِجْلَ الغُرَابِ مُلْكُكَ فِى النَّا
سِ عَلَى مَنْ أَرَادَ فِيهِ الفُجُورَا
(assumed tropical:)  [Thy dominion among the people has bound
with a bond not to be undone him who desires,
within the scope of it, transgression]: (S, TA:)
i. e. thy dominion has become firm so that it
cannot be undone; like as what is termed رجل
الغراب cannot be undone by the young camel.
(TA.) And one says, صُرَّ عَلَيْهِ رِجْلُ الغُرَابِ,
meaning (tropical:)  The affair was, or became, difficult

subsistence, was, or became, difficult to him.

-b5-  رِجْلُ الجَرَادِ (assumed tropical:)  A certain
plant, like البَقْلَةُ اليَمَانِيَّةُ [see art. بقل: accord. to

upper curved extremity being called its يَد: (Kh,
S:) or the part below its كَبِد [q. v.]: accord. to
AHn, it is more complete, or perfect, than its يد:
accord. to IAar, أَرْجُلُ القَوْسِ means, when the
string is bound, or braced, the upper parts of the
bow; and أَيْدِيهَا, its lower parts; and the former
are stronger than the latter: and he cites the
saying,
لَيْتَ القِسىَّ كُلُّهَا مِنْ أَرْجُلِ
[Would that the bows were all of them, or wholly,
of what are termed أَرْجُل]: the two extremities
of the bow, he says, are called its ظُفْرَانِ; and its
two notches, its فُرْضَتَانِ; and its curved ends, its
سِئَتَانش; and after the سئتان are the طَائِفَانِ; and
after the طائفان, the أَبْهَرَانِ; and the portion

the two knots of the suspensory. (TA.) ―
-b10-

―
-b12-  رِجْلٌ also signifies (tropical:)  A part, or portion, of a

شَاةٍ مَشْوِيَّةٍ فَقَسَمْتُهَا إِلَّا كَتِفِهَا, meaning (tropical:)  [Aboo-Bekr gave to us] the half of a roasted sheep, or
goat, divided lengthwise [and I divided it into
shares, except its shoulder-blade, or its shoulder]:
she called the half thus by a synecdoche: (IAth,
O, TA:) or she meant the leg (رجْل) thereof,
with what was next to it [for مما يَلِيهَا in the O
and TA, I read بِمَا يَلِيهَا] of the lateral half: or
she thus alluded to the whole thereof, like as one
does by the term رَأْس. (O, TA. [But see what
here next follows.]) And in another trad., the
رِجْل of a [wild] ass is mentioned as a gift, meaning (tropical:)  One of the two lateral halves: or, as some
say, the thigh: (TA:) and it is explained as
meaning the whole; but this is a mistake. (Mgh.)
―
-b13-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The half of a رَاوِيَة [or pair of leathern
bags, such as are borne by a camel, one on each
side,] of wine, and of olive-oil. (AHn, K.) ―
-b14-
It is also applied by some to (assumed tropical:)  A pair of trousers
or drawers; and رِجْلُ سَرَاوِيلَ occurs in this sense
in a trad., for رِجْلَا سَرَاوِيلَ; like زَوْجُ خُفٍّ and
زَوْجُ نَعْلٍ, whereas each is properly زَوْجَانِ; for
the سراويل are of the articles of clothing for the
two legs: (IAth, TA:) this is what is meant by
the saying in the K [and in the O likewise] that
الرِّجْلُ also signifies السَّرَاوِيلُ [app. for
مِنَ السَّرَاوِيلِ الطَّاقُ]. (TA.) ―
-b15-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A swarm,
or numerous assemblage, of locusts: (S:) or a
detached number (قِطْعَةٌ) thereof: (K:) [or] one
says [or says also] رِجْلُ جَرَادٍ, (S, TA,) and
رِجْلٌ مِنْ جَرَادٍ: it is masc. and fem.: (TA:)
a pl. without a proper sing.; like عَانَةٌ (a herd of
[wild] asses, S) and خِيطٌ (a flock of ostriches, S)
and صُِوَارٌ (a herd of [wild] bulls or cows, S):
(S, K:) pl. أَرْجَالٌ; (K:) and so in the next two
senses here following. (TA.) ―
-b16-  And hence, as
being likened thereto, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  An army: (K:)
or a numerous army. (TA.) ―
-b17-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A share
in a thing. (IAar, K.) So in the saying, لِى فِى
مَالِكَ رِجْلٌ (assumed tropical:)  [To me belongs a share in thy property]. (TA.) ―
-b18-  And (tropical:)  A time. (TA.) One
says, كَانَ ذٰلِكَ عَلِى رِجْلِ فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  That was in the
time of such a one; (S, K, TA;) in his life-time:
(K, TA:) like the phrase على رَأْسِ فُلَانٍ. (TA.)
―
-b19-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Precedence. (Abu-l- Mekárim, K.)
When the files of camels are collected together,
an owner, or attendant, of camels says, لِىَ الرِّجْلُ,
i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [The precedence belongs to me; or] I
precede: and another says, لَا بَلِ الرِّجْلُ لِى (assumed tropical:)  [Nay,
but the precedence belongs to me]: and they
contend together for it, each unwilling to yield it
to the other: (Abu-l-Mekárim, TA:) pl. أَرْجَالٌ:
(K:) and so in the senses here following. (TA.)
―
-b20-  And (assumed tropical:)  Distress; straitness of the means of
subsistence or of the conveniences of life; a state
of pressing want; misfortune; or calamity; and
poverty. (O, K.)
-A2-  Also A man who sleeps
much: (O, K:) fem. with ة. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And A
man such as is termed قَاذُورَةٌ [which means
foul in language; evil in disposition: one who
cares not what he does or says: very jealous:
one who does not mix, or associate as a friend,
with others, because of the evilness of his disposition, nor alight with them: &c.: see art. قذر].
(O, K.)
-A3-  Also Blank paper; (O, K, * TA;)
without writing. (TA.)
رَجَلٌ: see رَاجِلُ, first sentence:
-A2-  and see also
رَجِلٌ, in two places.
-A3-  [It is also explained as
here follows, as though a quasi-inf. n. of 4 in a
sense mentioned in the first paragraph on the
authority of the S and O, or inf. n. of رَجَلَ in the
same sense; thus:] The sending, (S, O,) or
leaving, (K, TA,) a lamb or kid or calf, (S, O,
TA,) or a young camel, (K, TA,) and a colt,
(TA,) with its mother, to such her whenever it
pleases: (S, O, K:) [but I rather think that this
is a loose explanation of the meaning implied by
رَجَلٌ used as an epithet; for it is added in the S
and O immediately, and in the K shortly after,
that] one says بَهْمَةٌ رَجَلٌ (S, O, K) and ↓ رَجِلٌ
(K) [meaning, as indicated in the S and O, A
lamb, or hid, or calf, sent with its mother to such
her whenever it pleases, or, as indicated in the K,
sucking, or that sucks, its mother]: pl. أَرْجَالٌ.
(S, O, K.) ―
-b2-  Also A horse [i. e. a stallion] sent
upon the خَيْل [meaning mares, to leap them]:
(K:) and in like manner one says خَيْلٌ رَجَلٌ,
[using it as a pl., app. meaning horses so sent,]
(K accord. to the TA,) or ↓ خَيْلٌ رَجِلَةٌ. (CK,
and so in my MS. copy of the K: [perhaps it
should be رَجَلَةٌ.])
رَجُلٌ (S, O, Mgh, Msb, K &c.) and ↓ رَجْلٌ,
(O, K,) the latter a dial. var., (O,) or, accord. to
Sb and El-Fárisee, a quasi-pl. n., [but app. of
رَاجِلٌ, not of رَجُلٌ,] called by Abu-l-Hasan a pl.,
(TA,) A man, as meaning the male of the human
species; (Msb;) the opposite of اِمْرَأَةٌ: (S, O,
Mgh:) applied only to one who has attained to
puberty and manhood: (K, * TA:) or as soon as
he is born, (K, TA,) and afterwards also: (TA:)
pl. رِجَالٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,) [applied in the
Kur lxxii. 6 to men and to jinn (or genii), like
نَاسٌ and أُنَاسٌ, and likewise a pl. of رَاجِلٌ, and of
its syn. رَجْلَانُ,] and رجَالَاتٌ, (S, K,) said by
some to be a pl. pl., (TA,) and ↓ رَجْلَةٌ, (Sb,
Msb, K, TA, in the CK رِجْلَةٌ, [which is a mistake, as is shown by what follows,]) of the measure فَعْلَةٌ, with fet-h to the ف, (Msb,) [but this
is, properly speaking, a quasi-pl. n.,] said to be
the only instance of its kind except كَمْأَةٌ, which,
however, some say is a n. un. like others of the
same form belonging to [coll.] gen. ns., (Msb,)
used as a pl. of pauc. instead of أَرْجَالٌ, (Sb, Ibn-Es-Serráj, Msb, TA,) because they assigned to
رَجُلٌ no pl. of pauc., (Sb, TA,) not saying أَرْجَالٌ
(TA) [nor رِجْلَةٌ], and ↓ رَجِلَةٌ, mentioned by AZ
as another pl., but this [also] is a quasi-pl. n.,
and of it Abu-l-' Abbás holds ↓ رَجْلَةٌ to be a
contraction, (TA,) and رِجَلَةٌ (Ks, K) and أَرَاجِلُ
(Ks, S, K) and [another quasi-pl. n. is] ↓ مَرْجَلٌ.
(IJ, K.) شَهِيدَيْنِ مِنْ رِجَالِكُمْ, in the Kur [ii.
282], means [Two witnesses] of the people of
your religion. (TA.) [رَجُلٌ also signifies A
woman's husband: and the dual] رَجُلَانِ [sometimes] means A man and his wife; predominance
being thus attributed to the former. (IAar, TA.)
And ↓ رَجُلَةٌ signifies A woman: (S, K:) or,
accord. to Er-Rághib, a woman who is, or affects
to be, or makes herself, like a man in some of her
qualities, or states, or predicaments. (TA.) It
is said of 'Áïsheh, (S, TA,) in a trad., which
confirms this latter explanation, (TA,) كَانَتْ
الرَّأْىِ, ↓ رَجُلَةَ, (S, TA,) meaning She was like a
man in judgment. (TA. [See also مَرْجَلَانِيَّةٌ.])
The dim. of رَجُلٌ is ↓ رُجَيْلٌ and ↓ رُوَيْجِلٌ: (S,
K:) the former reg.: (TA:) the latter irreg., as
though it were dim. of رَاجِلٌ: (S, TA:) [but it
seems that رُوَيْجِلٌ is properly the dim. of رَاجِلٌ,
though used as that of رَجُلٌ.] One says, هُوَ رَجُلُ
وَحْدِهِ [He is a man unequalled, or that has no
second], (IAar, L in art. وحد,) and وَحْدِهِ ↓ رُجَيْلُ
[A little man (probably meaning the contrary)
unequalled, &c.]. (S and L in that art.) And
it is said in a trad., إِنْ صَدَقَ ↓ أَفْلَحَ الرُّوَيْجِلُ
[The little man prospers if he speak truth]
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Also One much given to coition: (Az,

-b4-  And Perfect, or complete
[in respect of bodily vigour or the like]: ('Eyn,
O, K, TA: [in the CK, والرّاجِلُ الكَامِلُ is erroneously put for والراَجل والكامل:]) or strong and
perfect or complete: sometimes it has this meaning, as an epithet: and when thus used, Sb
allows its being in the gen. case in the phrase,
مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ رَجُلٍ أَبُوهُ [I passed by a man whose
father is strong &c.]; though the nom. case is
more common: he says, also, that when you say,
هُوَ الرَّجُلُ, you may mean that he is perfect or
complete, or you may mean any man that speaks
and that walks upon two legs. (M, TA.)
-A2-  [In
the CK, شَعَرٌ رَجُلٌ is erroneously put for شَعَرٌ
رَجْلٌ: and, in the same, رَجُلُ الشَّعَرِ, as syn. with
رَجِلُ الشَّعَرِ, is app. a mistake for رَجْلُ الشَّعَرِ; but
it is mentioned in this sense by 'Iyád:] see the
paragraph here following.

crispness or curliness, (K,) or not very crisp or
curly, nor lank, (ISk, S,) or neither very crisp

the CK as next follows,] and ↓ رَجُلُهُ, with damm
to the ج, added by 'Iyád, in the Meshárik, (MF,
TA,) A man having hair such as is described
above: pl. أَرْجَالٌ and رَجَالَى; (M, K;) the former,
most probably, accord. to analogy, pl. of رَجْلٌ;
but both may be pls. of رَجِلٌ and رَجَلٌ: accord.
to Sb, however, رَجَلٌ has no broken pl., its pl.
being only رَجَلُونَ. (M, TA.)

رَجْلَةٌ: see رَجُلٌ, first sentence, in two places:

act of the man who has no beast [to carry him];
(T, TA;) an inf. n. (T, S, TA) of رَجِلَ: (T, TA:
[see 1, first sentence:]) or it signifies strength to
walk, or go on foot; (Msb, K;) and is a simple
subst.: (Msb:) and also excellence of a دَابَّة
[meaning horse or ass or mule] and of a camel
in endurance of long journeying; in which sense
[Az says] I have not heard any verb belonging
to it except [by implication] in the epithets رَجِيلَةٌ,
applied to a she-camel, and رَجِيلٌ, applied to an
ass and to a man: (T, TA:) and (M) ↓ رِجْلَةٌ,
with kesr, signifies vehemence, or strength, of
walking or going on foot; (M, K;) as also ↓ رَجْلَةٌ.
(K. [In the K is then added, “or with damm,
strength to walk, or go on foot; ” but it seems
evident that we should read “ and with damm,”
&c., agreeably with the passage in the M, in
which the order of the two clauses is the reverse
of their order in the K.]) One says, حَمَلَكَ اللّٰهُ
عَنِ الرُّجْلَةِ and مِنَ الرُّجْلَةِ, i. e. [May God give
thee a beast to ride upon, and so relieve thee
from going on foot, or] from the act of the man
who has no beast. (T, TA.) And هُوَ ذُو رُجْلَةٍ He
has strength to walk, or go on foot. (Msb.) ―

there be in him some other [similar] وَضَح. (S.)

to a soft, or plain, tract: (K:) pl. رِجَلٌ; (S, K;)
a term similar to مَذَانِبُ [pl. of مِذْنَبٌ]: so says
Er-Rághib: the waters (he says) pour to it, and
it retains them: and on one occasion he says, the
رِجْلَة is like the قَرِيّ; it is wide, and people alight
in it: he says also, it is a water-course of a plain,
or soft, tract, such as is ملباث, or, as in one copy,
مِنْبَات [which is app. the right reading, meaning
productive of much herbage]. (TA.)
-A5-  الرِجْلَةُ
also signifies A species of the [kind of plants
called] حَيْض. (K.) ―

الحَمُقَآءُ; (S, Msb, TA;) thus the people commonly called it; i. e. البقلةالحمقآء; (TA;) [all
of these three appellations being applied to Purslane, or purslain; and generally to the garden
purslane:] it is [said to be] called الحمقآء because
it grows not save in a water-course: (S: [i. e. the
wild sort: but see art. حمق:]) whence the saying,
أَحْمَقُ مِنْ رِجْلَةٍ [explained in art. حمق], (S, K,)
meaning this بَقْلَة: (TA:) the vulgar say, مِنْ

difficult, in which one cannot go except on foot:

with stones, in which it is difficult to go along:
(S:) or hard and rough, which horses and camels
cannot traverse, and none can but a man on foot:
(AHeyth, TA:) or that impedes the feet by its

manner with the article ال: (O, K, TA:) in the
T, the sing. is written رَجْلِيٌّ; and said to be a

[Recently thy بُرْد was of the sort called مِرْجَلِىّ;]
i. e. thou hast only recently been clad with the
مَرَاجِل, and usedst to wear the عَبَآء: [whence it
appears that the مِرْجَل may be thus called because
worn only by full-grown men:] so says IAar:
it is said in the M that ثَوْبٌ مِرْجَلِىٌّ is from
الممرجل [i. e. المُمَرْجَلُ, perhaps a mistranscription for المَرْجَلُ]: (TA:) [but] ↓ مُمَرْجَلٌ signifies a sort of garments, or cloths, variegated, or
figured; (S and K in art. مرجل;) similar to the
مَرَاجِل, or similar to these in their variegation or
decoration, or their figured forms; as explained
by Seer and others; (TA in that art.;) [wherefore] Sb holds the م of مَرَاجِلُ to be an essential
part of the word; (S in that art.;) and hence
Seer and the generality of authors also say that it
is a radical, though Abu-l-'Alà and some others
