رزدقرَزْدَقٌ A row of palm-trees, and of men: (IF,
S, Msb, K:) or [simply] a row: (JK, Mgh:)
and an extended cord or string or thread: (JK:)
an arabicized word, from رَسْتَهْ, (S, K,) which
is Persian: (S:) Lth says, What the people [now]
call رَسْتَق we call رَزْدَق, meaning a row: it is an
adventitious word. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] one says,
اِجْعَلِ الأَمْرَ رَزْدَقًا وَاحِدًا, meaning Make thou the
affair, or case, [uniform, or] one uniform thing.
(Fr, TA in art. بأح.)
رُزْدَاقٌ (S, Msb, K, &c.) and رُزْتَاقٌ (Lh, L, TA)
and رُسْدَاقٌ (ISk, K) and رُسْتَاقٌ, (Lh, S, Msb,
K, &c.,) but this last disallowed by ISk,
(TA,) [though allowed by many others, and of
frequent occurrence,] and said by some to be
post-classical, and to be correctly رُزْدَاقٌ, (Msb,)
arabicized, (S, Msb, K,) of Pers. origin, (S,) from
رُوسْتَا, (K,) [erroneously] said by IF to be from
رَزْدَقٌ signifying as explained above; (Msb;) A
rural district; or district consisting of cultivated
land with towns or villages; syn. سَوَادٌ, (S,) or
سَوَادٌ and قُرًي: (K:) Yákoot explains رُسْتَاق as
applied, in his time, in the country of the Persians,
to any place [or district] in which are sown fields,
and towns or villages; not to cities, like El-Basrah
and Baghdád; so that it is, with the Persians,
like سَوَادٌ with the people of Baghdád, and is a
more special term than كُورَةٌ [in Arabic] and
إِسْتَان [in Persian]: (TA:) or it is used as meaning an outlying district, or a border-district, of a
country: (Msb:) [but the correctness of this last
explanation is questionable:] the pl. is رَزَادِيقُ
(Msb) [and رَزَاتِيقُ and رَسَادِيقُ] and رَسَاتِيقُ (S,
Msb) and رُزْدَاقَاتٌ (Har p. 249) [&c.].
