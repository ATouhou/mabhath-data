رَبَّهُ, (M, K,) aor.
رَبُ3َ, inf. n. رَبٌّ, (M,) [He
was, or became, its رَبّ, or lord, possessor, owner,
&c.;] he possessed, or owned, it; had possession of
it, and command, or authority, over it; (M, K;)
namely, a thing; (K;) syn. مَلَكَهُ. (M, K.) [And
in like manner, He was, or became, his رَبّ, or
lord, &c.] You say, رَبَبْتُ القَوْمَ, [inf. n. as above
and مَرَبَّةٌ and رِبَابَةٌ,] I ruled, or governed, the
people; syn. سُسْتُهُمْ; i. e. I was, or became, over
them [as their lord, master, or chief]. (S.) And
طَالَتْ مَرَبَّتُهُمُ النَّاسَ and رِبَابَتُهُم Their ruling, or
governing, the people continued long. (M, K. *)
The saying of Safwán, (T, S,) on the day of
Honeyn, (T,) لَأَنْ يَرُبَّنِى رَجُلٌ مِنْ قُرَيْشٍ أَحَبُّ إِلَىَّ
مِنْ أُنْ يَرُبَّنِى رَجُلٌ مِنْ هَوَازِنَ means [Assuredly
that a man of Kureysh] should be over me (T, S)
as رَبّ [or lord, &c.], and as master, or chief,
having command, or authority, over me, (T,) [is
more pleasing to me than that a man of Hawázin
should be lord, &c., over me.] ―
-b2-  Also, (S, M,
Mgh, K,) aor.
رَبُ3َ, (S, M,) inf. n. رَبٌّ, (S, Mgh,
M,) He reared, fostered, brought up, fed, or
nourished, him; i. q. رَبَّاهُ; (S, M, Mgh, K;)
namely, his child, (S,) or a child, (M, K,) either
his own or another's; taking good care of him,
and acting as his guardian, (M,) until he attained
to puberty, or to the utmost term of youth: (M,
K:) and so ↓ ربّبهُ, (Lh, S, M, Mgh, K,) or this
has a more emphatic signification, (TA,) inf. n.
تَربِيبٌ (Lh, M, Mgh, K) and تَرِبَّةٌ; (Lh, M, K;)
and ↓ تربّبه; (S, M, K;) and ↓ ارتبّهُ: (M, K:)
[in like manner, also,] ↓ رَبْرَبَ signifies he reared,
fostered, or brought up, an orphan: (AA, T:)
and accord. to IDrd, (M,) رَبِبْتُهُ is a dial. var. [of
رَبَبْتُهُ]: (M, K:) he says also that the verb is
used in like manner in relation to the young one
of an animal other than man; and he used to cite
this ex.:
كَانَ لَنَا وَهْوَ فَلُوٌّ نِرْبِبُهْ
[He belonged to us when he was a young weaned,
or one-year-old, colt, we rearing him]; with
the letter characteristic of the aor. meksoor, to
show that the second letter of the preterite is
meksoor, accord to the opinion of Sb in respect
of a case of this kind; and this, he says, is peculiar to the dial. of Hudheyl in this species of verb.
(M, TA.) رَبَّتِ المَرْأَةُ صَبِيَّهَا, used tropically,
means (tropical:)  The woman patted her child repeatedly
on its side in order that it might sleep. (A, TA.)
[See 2 in art. ربت.] [It is said that] the primary
signification of الرَّبُّ is التَّرْبِيَةُ; i. e. The bringing
a thing to a state of completion by degrees. (Bd
in i. l.) A poet says, (S,) namely, Hassán
Ibn-Thábit, (TA,)
مِنْ دُرَّةٍ بَيْضَآءَ صَافِيَةٍ
حَائِرُ البَحْرِ ↓ مِمَّا تَرَبَّبَ
[Than a white, clear, pearl, of those which the
depth of the sea has brought to maturity]; meaning a pearl which the shell has reared, or brought
to maturity in the bottom of the water. (S, TA.)
And the phrase لَكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَرُبُّهَا occurs in a trad.,
meaning [Thou hast wealth] which thou preservest, and of which thou takest care, and which
thou fosterest like as the man fosters his child.
(TA.) ―

into a right, or proper, state; adjusted it, arranged it, ordered it, or rightly disposed it;
(M, K;) and established it firmly: (M:) or he
managed, conducted, or regulated, the affair:
(Msb:) [perhaps from رَبَّ signifying “ he reared,”
&c.; but more probably, I think, from what next
follows.] ―
-b5-  رَبَّ, (T, S, M, K,) aor.
رَبُ3َ, (T, M,)
inf. n. رَبُّ (T, M, K) and رُبٌّ; (K) and ↓ ربّب;
(M;) He seasoned a skin (T, S, K) for clarified
butter (T, S) with رُبّ [i. e. rob, or inspissated
juice], (T, S, K,) of dates, (TA,) which imparts
a good odour to it, (S, TA,) and prevents the
flavour and odour of the butter from being spoiled:
(TA:) or he seasoned a skin with رُبّ, and a jar
with tar or pitch: or, as some say, رَبَبْتُهُ signifies

but the former also is allowable, (M,) (tropical:)  He made
oil, or ointment, good, and sweet, or fragrant, or
he perfumed it, (M, K, * TA,) accord. to Lh, by
infusing in it jasmine or some other sweet-smelling
plant. (M, TA.) See also مُرَبَّبٌ, below. ―
-b6-  رَبَّ
also signifies He collected, or congregated, (K,
TA,) people: (TA:) [and so, probably, ↓ ربّب:

the epithet رُبَّى,]) said of a ewe or she-goat, She
brought forth: (Lh, M, K:) or, as some say,
she conceived: or, accord. to some, there is no
verb to the epithet رُبَّى: (M:) AZ says that it
has no verb: (Msb:) [but] ↓ رِبَابٌ is an inf. n.
used in relation to a ewe or she-goat as meaning
her being in the state of such as is termed رُبَّى
[q. v.]: (S, M, * Msb, * K: *) and in relation to
a she-camel, as in the ex. cited by Munteji' Ibn-Nebhán to As,
حَنِينَ أُمِّ البَوِّفِى رِبَابِهَا

camel in the time of her having recently brought
forth]: (S:) and used also in relation to a
woman as meaning her having recently brought
forth: or her state within two months after
having brought forth: or within twenty days:
whence the phrase, in a trad., حَمْلُهَا رِبَابٌ, meaning She becomes pregnant soon after having
brought forth. (TA.)

-A2-  تربّبوا They collected themselves together, or congregated; or they became
collected or congregated. (S.)

R. Q. 1
رَبْرَبَ: see 1.
رَبْ: see رَأَبَ, of which it is an imperative.

and رَبَمَا &c.: see رُبَّ.
رَبٌ: see the next paragraph, last sentence
but one.
رَبٌّ A lord, a possessor, an owner, or a proprietor, syn. مَالِكٌ, (T, IAmb, S, M, A, Msb, K,)
of a thing, (T,) of anything, (S, M, A, K,) or of
an irrational thing; (Msb;) a person who has a
right, or just title or claim, to the possession of
anything; or its صَاحِب [which is syn. with مَالِك];
(M, A, K;) رَبٌّ and مَالِكٌ and صَاحِبٌ all signifying in Pers. خُدَاوَنْد: (KL:) and a lord,
master, or chief; (Msb, TA;) or a lord, master,
or chief, to whom obedience is paid: (IAmb,
TA:) and a lord, ruler, governor, regulator, or
disposer; (TA;) an orderer, a rectifier, or a
reformer: (IAmb, TA:) a rearer, fosterer,
bringer-up, feeder, or nourisher: and a completer, or an accomplisher: (TA:) it is an
epithet, like نَمٌّ from نَمَّ: or an inf. n. used as an
intensive epithet; like عَدْلٌ; (Ksh and Bd * in
i. l;) originally signifying the “ bringing (a thing)
to a state of completion by degrees;” (Bd, ibid.;)
then used in the sense of مَالِكٌ: (Ksh and Bd
ibid.:) the pl. [of pauc.] is أَرْبَابٌ and [of mult.]
رُبُوبٌ, (M, K,) and accord. to Sh, رِبَابٌ also,
(TA,) signifying أَصْحَابٌ, (K,) and ↓ رَبُوبٌ is
app. a quasi-pl. n.: (M:) the fem. is ↓ رَبَّةٌ; of
which the pl. is رَبَّاتٌ. (T.) Whoever possesses a
thing is its رَبّ: you say, هُوَ رَبُّ الدَّابَّةِ [He is the
possessor, or owner, or master, of the beast], and
الدَّارِ [of the house], (T,) and المَالِ [of the property, or cattle]; (Msb;) and البَيْتِ ↓ هِىَ رَبَّةُ
[She is the owner, or mistress, of the house or
tent]. (T.) With the article ال, it is [properly]
applied only to God: (T, S, M, A, Msb, K:) He
is رَبُّ الأَرْبَابِ [The Lord of lords]. (T. [Thus
the pl. with the article ال is applied to created
beings.]) To any other being it is not [properly]
applied but as a prefixed noun governing another
noun as its complement in the gen. case [or in a
similar manner]. (S.) The pagan Arabs, however, sometimes applied it to A king, (S,) or to a
lord as meaning a master or chief: (Msb:) El-
Hárith says, (S, Msb,) i. e. Ibn-Hillizeh, (S,)
وَهُوَ الرَّبُّ وَالشَّهِيدُ عَلَى يُوْ
مِ الحِيَارَيْنِ وَالبَلَآءُ بَلَآءُ
(S, Msb,) i. e. And he (meaning El-Mundhir
Ibn-Má-es-Semà, or, as some say, 'Amr Ibn-Hind,) was the king [or lord] and witness of our
fighting on the day of El-Hiyárán (the name of
a place), and the trial was a hard trial. (EM,
p. 285: [in which الحَيَارَيْنِ is erroneously put for
الحِيَارَيْنِ.]) Some forbid that a man should be
called the رَبّ of his slave: (Msb:) it is said in a
trad. that the slave shall not say to his master,
رَبّى, because it is like attributing a partner to
God: (TA:) but رَبّ is sometimes used in the
sense of lord as meaning master or chief prefixed
to a noun signifying a rational being governed by
it in the gen. case: thus in the saying of the
Prophet, حَتَّى تَلِدَ الأَمَةُ رَبَّهَا [So that the female
slave shall bring forth him who will become
her master], or ↓ رَبَّتَهَا [her mistress], accord. to
different transmitters; (Msb;) relating to the
signs of the hour of resurrection: i. e., the female
slave shall bring forth to her master a child that
shall be as a master [or mistress] to her because
like his [or her] father in rank: meaning that
captives and concubines shall be numerous.
(TA.) As to the phrase in the Kur [xii. 42],
اُذْكُرْنِى عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ [Mention thou me in the presence of thy lord], Joseph thus addressed his
fellow-prisoner agreeably with the acceptation in
which he [the latter] understood the words. (TA.)
A similar instance also occurs in the same chapter,
in the verse immediately preceding. (Msb.) In
another verse, [23 of the same ch.,] إِنَّهُ رَبِّى
[Verily he is my lord] may refer to Joseph's
master or to God. (M, TA.) The words of the
Kur [lxxxix. 28 and 29], اِرْجِعِى إِلَى رَبِّكِ رَاضِيَةً
مَرْضِيَّةً فَادْخُلِى فِى عَبْدىِ, as some read, [instead
of عِبَادِى,] may mean Return to thine owner,
[approving, approved,] and enter into my servant.
(M, TA.) ―
-b2-  Without the article ال, as some
say, (L, TA,) it is sometimes written and pronounced ↓ رَبٌ, without teshdeed; (L, K;) as in
the following verse, cited by El-Mufaddal,
وَقَدْ عَلِمَ الأَقْوَامُ أَنْ لَيْسَ فَوْقَهُ
رَبٌ غَيْرُ مَنْ يَعْطِى الحُظُوظَ وَيَرْزُقُ
[And the peoples have known that there is not
above him a lord beside Him who gives the portions of mankind and of others and grants the
means of subsistence]. (L.) And Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà [i. e. Th] mentions the phrase لَا وَرَبِيكَ لَا
أَفْعَلُ, for لَا وَرَبِّكَ [i. e. No, by thy Lord, I will
not do such a thing]; the [latter] ب being changed
into ى because of the reduplication. (M, K: * in
the CK رَبْيِكَ.)
رُبَّ is a word of which there are seventy dial.
vars., all mentioned by Zekereeyà El-Ansáree in
his great Expos. of the “ Munferijeh,” but only
eighteen of which are mentioned in the K, including some that are formed with the affix ت,
some with the affix مَا, and some with both these
affixes together; as follows: (TA:) رُبَّ (T, S, M,
Msb, Mughnee, K, &c.) and رَبَّ (T, M, Mughnee, K) and رُبُّ, (Mughnee,) and ↓ رُبَ (T, S, M,
Mughnee, K) and رَبَ (T, M, Mughnee, K) and
رُبُ and رُبْ (Mughnee, K) and رَبْ; (Mughnee;)
and ↓ رُبَّتَ (T, S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K) and رَبَّتَ
(M, Mughnee, K) and رُبُّتَ and رُبَّتُ and رَبَّتُ and
رُبُّتُ and رُبَّتِ and رَبَّتِ and رُبُّتِ and رَبُّت (TA)
and رُبَّتْ and رَبَّتْ (Mughnee) and رُبُّتْ, (TA,)
and ↓ رُبَتَ (T, Mughnee, K) and رَبَتَ (Mughnee,
K) and رُبُتَ and رُبْتَ and رَبْتَ and رُبَتُ and رَبَتُ
and رُبُتُ and رُبْتُ and رَبْتُ and رُبَتِ and رَبَتِ and
رُبُتِ and رَبُتِ and رُبْتِ and رَبْتِ (TA) and رُبَتْ
and رَبَتْ (Mughnee) and رُبُتْ; (TA;) and رُبَّمَا
(T, S, M, K) and رَبَّمَا (M, K) and رُبُّمَا, (TA,)
and ↓ رُبَمَا (T, K) and رَبَمَا (K) and رُبُمَا and رُبْمَا
and رَبْمَا; (TA;) and ↓ رُبَّتَمَا (T, S, M, K) and
رَبَّتَمَا (M, K) and رُبُّتَمَا and رُبَّتُمَا and رَبَّتُمَا and رُبُّتُمَا
and رُبَّتْمَا and رَبَّتْمَا and رُبُّتْمَا, (TA,) and ↓ رُبَتَمَا
and رَبَتَمَا (M, K) and رُبُتَمَا and رُبْتَمَا and رَبْتَمَا and
رُبَتُمَا and رَبَتُمَا and رُبُتُمَا and رُبْتُمَا and رَبْتُمَا and
رُبَتْمَا and رَبَتْمَا and رُبُتْمَا: (TA:) [of all these, the
most common are رُبَّ and رُبَّمَا: and] ↓ رُبَّتَ is the
most common of the forms that have the affix ت:
(Mughnee and K on the letter ت:) and the forms
with teshdeed are more common than the [corresponding] forms without teshdeed. (M.) It is
a word, (M,) or particle, (T, S, Mughnee, K,)
governing the gen. case: (S, M, Mughnee, K:)
or a noun, (K, TA,) [i. e. an indecl. noun,] in
the opinion of the Koofees and some others; but
this opinion is rejected by Ibn-Málik in the Tesheel and its Expos., and by AHei, and by IHsh
in the Mughnee. (TA.) Accord. to some, (K,
TA,) it is used to denote a small number, (T, M,
Msb, K, TA,) always, (TA,) or mostly: (Msb,
TA:) [thus it may be rendered Few if we render
the noun following it as a pl.; and scarce any if
we render the noun following as a sing. or a pl.:]
it is the contr. of كَمْ when this latter is not used
interrogatively: (T:) [and with مَا affixed, restricting it from government, it may be rendered
Few times, or seldom:] or it is used to denote a
large number; (K, TA;) i. e. always: so says
IDrst: (TA:) [thus used, but such is not always
the case, it may be rendered Many, whether we
render the noun following it as a sing. or as a pl.:
and with مَا affixed, Many times, many a time,
oftentimes, ofttimes, often, or frequently:] or it
is used to denote a small and a large number;
(Mughnee, K;) often the latter, and seldom the
former: (Mughnee:) or it is used in a case of
boasting, or glorying, (K, TA,) exclusively of
other cases, (TA,) to denote a large number:
(K, TA:) or it does not denote by itself either a
small number or a large number; but one or the
other of these meanings is inferred from the context: (K:) [but sometimes neither of these meanings can be clearly inferred from the context: in
these cases, it may be rendered Some: and with
مَا affixed, Sometimes:] accord. to Er-Radee, its
primary meaning is to denote a small number,
but it has been so much used to denote a large
number as to be in this latter sense as though it
were proper, and in the former sense as though it
were tropical, requiring context [to explain it].
(Marginal note in my copy of the Mughnee.)
[Without the affix ما,] it governs an indeterminate noun (T, * S, Msb, Mughnee, K) only,
(T, S, K,) and a pronoun. (S, M, Mughnee.)
You say, رُبَّ يَوْمٍ بَكَّرْتُ فِيهِ [Few, or many, days
have I gone forth early therein]: (T:) and
رُبَّ رَجُلٍ قَائِمٌ [Few, or many, men are standing]:
(M:) and رُبَّ رَجُلٍ قَامَ [Few, or many, men
stood]: (Msb:) and in like manner, رَجُلٍ ↓ رُبَّتَ;
(Msb;) for the ت in this case is not a denotative
of the fem. gender. (Msb.) The pronoun affixed
to it is of the third pers., (S, M,) and is [generally] sing. and masc., (S, Mughnee,) though it
may be followed by a fem. and by a dual and by
a pl.: (S:) notwithstanding its being determinate
in the utmost degree, its use in this manner is
allowable because it resembles an indeterminate
noun in its being used without the previous mention of the noun to which it relates; and hence it
requires a noun to explain it: (IJ, M:) it annuls
the government of رُبَّ; (TA;) and the indeterminate noun that follows it is put in the accus.
case as a specificative: (S, Mughnee:) thus you
say, رُبَّهُ رَجُلًا قَدْ ضَرَبْتُ [Few, or many, men I
have beaten]: (S, M: *) but accord. to the Koofees, you say رُبَّهُ رَجُلًا, (S,) and رُبَّهَا امْرَأَةً, (M,)
and رُبَّهُمَا رَجُلَيْنش, and رُبَّهُمْ رِجَالًا, and رُبَّهُنَّ نِسَآءً:
he who puts the pronoun in the sing. [in all
cases] holds it to be allusive to something unknown; and he who does not put it in the sing.
[when it is not followed by a sing. noun] holds it
to be used in reply to a question, as though it
were said to a man, “Hast thou not any young
women? ” and he answered, رُبَّهُنَّ جَوَارٍ قَدْ مَلَكْتُ
[Few, or many, young women have I possessed]:
Ibn-Es-Sarráj says that the grammarians are as
though they were of one consent in holding رُبَّ
to be a replicative [app. meaning in a case of this
kind, with an affixed pronoun]: (S:) [but it is
not always a replicative in a case of this kind;
though perhaps it was originally:] AHeyth cites
as an ex.
وَرُبَّهُ عَطِبًا أَنْقَذْتُ مِ العَطَبِ
[And many a perishing man have I saved from
perdition]. (TA. [But the reading commonly
found in grammars is مِنْ عَطَبِهْ from his state of
perdition.]) The following is an ex. of the use of
رُبَّ to denote a small number, [or rather to denote
singleness,]
أَلَا رُبَّ مَوْلُودٍ وَلَيْسَ لَهُ أَبٌ
وَذِى وَلَدٍ لَمْ يَلْدِهِ أَبَوَانِ
[Now surely scarce an instance is there of anyone
born not having a father, and of anyone having
offspring whom two parents have not procreated];
meaning [our Lord] Jesus and Adam: (Mughnee: [but I have substituted يَلْدِهِ for يَلْدَهُ, the
reading in my copy of that work: لَمْ يَلْدِهِ is for
لَمْ يَلِدْهُ, for the sake of the metre; like as لِمْ أَجْدِ
is for لَمْ أَجِدْ:]) and among the many exs. of its
use to denote a large number, is the saying, in a
trad., يَا رُبَّ كاَسِيَةٍ فِى الدُّنْيَا عَارِيَةٌ يَوْمَ القِيٰمَةِ [O,
many a female having clothing in the present state
of existence will be naked on the day of resurrection!]; and the saying of an Arab of the desert,
after the ending of Ramadán, يَا رُبَّ صَائِمِهِ لَنْ
يَعصُومَهُ وَيَا رُبَّ قَائِمِهِ لَنْ يَقُومَهُ [O, many a keeper
of its fast shall not keep its fast again! and O,
many a passer of its nights in prayer, or per-
former of its تَرَاوِيح, shall not pass its nights in
prayer, or perform its تراويح, again!]. (Mughnee.) [But in this last ex., and in others, it relates
to few in comparison with others, though many
abstractedly.] ―
-b2-  مَا is affixed to رُبَّ &c. in order
that a verb may follow it; (S, Mughnee;) and
the verb that follows it is generally a preterite,
(T, Mughnee,) as to the letter and the meaning:
(Mughnee:) you say, رُبَّمَا جَآءَنِى فُلَانٌ [Seldom,
or often, such a one came to me, or has come to
me]: (T:) sometimes the verb is a future; (T,
Mughnee;) but only when it expresses an event
of which one is certain: (T:) so in the saying in
the Kur [xv. 2], رُبَّمَا يَوَدُّ الَّذينَ كَفَرُوا لَوْ كَانُوا
مُسْلِمِينَ, (T, S, M, Mughnee), meaning Often
[will those who have disbelieved wish that they
had been Muslims]; (Mughnee, Jel;) or seldom,
(Zj, T, M, Jel,) because terrors will bereave them
of their reason so that they will but seldom recover reason to wish this; (Jel;) for God's
threat is true, as though it had come to pass, and
therefore the verb here is equivalent to a preterite [which is often used in the Kur and elsewhere in this manner]. (T.) مَا is also sometimes
affixed when a noun follows, (T, Mughnee,) or a
nominal proposition, and generally restricts رُبَّ
&c. from governing: thus, Aboo-Duwád says,
رُبَّمَا الجَامِلُ المُؤَبَّلُ فِيهِمْ
وَعَنَا جِيجُ بَيْنَهُنَّ المِهَارُ
[Sometimes, or often, the numerous herd of camels
is among them, and there are swift horses, among
which are the colts]: another says, making رُبَّ,
with مَا affixed, to govern,
رُبَّمَا ضَرْبَةٍ بِسَيْفٍ صَقِيلٍ
قَيْنِ بُصْرَى وَطَعْنَةٍ نَجْلَآءَ
[Many a stroke with a polished sword of the
forging of Busrà, (the Bozrah of the Bible, a
city famous for its sword-blades,) and many a
wide spear-wound; or, perhaps, few strokes &c.]:
(Mughnee: [but I have substituted قَيْنِ for بَيْنَ,
which is the reading in my copy of the Mughnee,
an evident mistranscription:]) and another, cited
by IAar, says,
غَارَةٍ ↓ مَاوِىَّ يَا رُبَّتَمَا
شَعْوَآءَ كَاللَّذْعَةِ بِالْمِيسَمِ
[Máweeyeh, (مَاوِىَّ being an apocopated proper
name of a woman, originally مَاوِيَّةُ,) O, many a
raid spreading widely and dispersedly, like the
burn with the branding-iron]. (T. [In the TT,
as from the T, I find, here, بَلْ in the place of يا,
which I find in a copy of the T, and which is
the reading commonly known.])

so rendered thick]; before which it is called صَقْرٌ:
(Msb in the present art. and in art. صقر:) what

expressed juice of grapes, and of apples, &c.,
cooked and [so] thickened: (KL:) and dregs,

butter, (IDrd, M, K,) and of olive-oil: (IDrd,
M:) pl. رُبُوبٌ and رِبَابٌ (S) [and pl. pl. (i. e. pl.

(M, K,) in Nejrán, (M,) belonging to [the tribe
of] Medh-hij (M, K) and Benu-l-Hárith-Ibn-Kaab, who held it in honour. (M.) In a trad. of
'Orweh (K, TA) Ibn-Mes'ood Eth-Thakafee,
(TA,) it is applied to El-Lát (اللَّاتُ), (K, TA,)
the rock which [the tribe of] Thakeef worshipped,

رُبَّةٌ A party, division, sect, or distinct body or
class, of men: (M:) or a large assembly or company: (K:) or a myriad; i. e. ten thousand:

the same: (M, K:) or this signifies a company
[of men]: (T:) the pl. of the former is رِبَابٌ:
(S, M:) and that of the latter is أَرِبَّةٌ: (T, K:)
by Th [and in the K], the former pl. is said to be
a pl. of رِبَّةٌ; but this is a mistake. (M.) ―
-b2-
[Hence, the pl.] رِبَابٌ signifies Companions. (K.)

'Adee and 'Okl; (T, TA;) or Teym and 'Adee
and 'Owf and Thowr and Ashyab; (TA; [but
for the orthography of the last of these names I
have found no authority; it is written in the TA
اشيب, without any syll. signs;]) and Dabbeh
was their paternal uncle; (TA;) or five tribes
which united in a confederacy, consisting of
Dabbeh and Thowr and 'Okl and Teym and
'Adee: (S:) they were thus called because of
their division into distinct bodies; (M;) or because
they collected themselves (As, Th, S, TA) in distinct bodies: (Th, M, TA:) or because they
united in a confederacy against Temeem Ibn-Murr: (AO, M, TA:) or because they dipped
their hands in some رُبّ, and formed a confederacy
over it: (As, T, M, K:) or, as some say, because
they congregated, and became like the رِبَاب [or
bundle] of arrows [used in the game called
المَيْسِر]: (TA:) the rel. n. is ↓ رُبِّىٌّ, formed from
the sing., (Sb, S, M,) accord. to a rule generally
observed except when a [single] man has a pl.
word for his name, as كِلَابٌ &c. (S, TA.) ―

The sing. (رُبَّةٌ) also signifies Plenty, or abundance, of the means of subsistence: (K:) and
constant, or inseparable, prosperity. (Khálid
Ibn-Jembeh, TA.)
-A2-  See also رُبَّى.
رِبَّةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, first
sentence. ―
-b2-  [Hence its pl.] أَرِبَّةٌ signifies Confederates; (S, IB, K;) [or] it is for ذَوُو أَرِبَّةٍ
having covenants; أَرِبَّةٌ being said by AAF to be
pl. of رِبَابٌ in the sense of عَهْدٌ. (IB, TA.)

locust-tree]. (M, K.)
رَبَبٌ, (S, M, K,) or مَآءٌ رَبَبٌ, (S, TA,) Much
water, (S, M, K,) collected together: (M:) or
sweet-water: (S, K:) accord. to Th, it means
مَا رَبَّبَهُ الطِينُ [app. such (water) as the clay has
collected; for تَرَبَّبَ signifying تَجَمَّعَ is probably
quasi-pass. of رَبَّبَ, so that this last seems to signify جَمَّعَ]. (M.)
رُبَتَ and رَبَتَ &c.; and رُبَتَمَا and رَبَتَمَا &c.:

رَبَابٌ Clouds: (M:) or white clouds: (S, K:)
or clouds that one sees beneath other clouds, (S,)
or clouds suspended beneath other clouds, (M,)

this latter is said by IB to be the signification
commonly known: (TA:) or clouds consisting of
an accumulation of parts: (A 'Obeyd, T:) n. un.
with ة. (A 'Obeyd, S, K.) Hence الرَّبَابُ as a
proper name of a woman. (A 'Obeyd, T, S.)
-A2-
Also A certain instrument of diversion, [meaning,
of music,] (K,) having strings, (TA,) with which
one plays [lit. beats]. (K.) [The رباب in common
use among the Arabs in the present day is a kind
of viol. A specimen of it is figured and described
in my work on the Modern Egyptians. Being
an instrument of remarkable simplicity, it is
probably similar to the ancient رباب.] Memdood
Ibn-'Abd-Allah El-Wásitee Er-Rabábee became
proverbial for his musical skill with the رباب.

-b3-  In the
phrase يُعْطِيهَا الأَمَانَ رِبَابُهَا, ending a verse of
Aboo-Dhu-eyb, describing some asses, رِبَاب is
said to signify An oath, or a promise, which the
owner of the asses takes of a people to permit
those asses to water: or the poet means that the
person giving those asses permission to water
gives to their owner an arrow, of those used in
the game called المَيْسِر, [as a token,] to show that
they have received permission to water, and that
no one may offer them any opposition: (TA:)
some say that رِبَابُهَا here means their owners:

رِبَاب in this verse is a pl. of رَبٌّ. (TA.)
