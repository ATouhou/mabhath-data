يلبيَلَبٌ Shields, of the kind called تِرْسَةٌ, (K,)
pl. of تُرْسٌ; or of the kind called دَرَقٌ, as
is said in the R and M; which two kinds differ
in this, that the درق, like the حَجَف, are of skin,
or leather, without any wood or sinews (or
nerves), whereas ترس is a more general appellation: (TA:) or coats of defence, syn. دُرُوعٌ,
(K,) of the fabric of El-Yemen: (TA:) made
[app. whether shields or coats of defence] of
skins; (K;) i. e., of the hides of camels: (TA:)
or coats of defence (دروع) of the fabric of ElYemen, made of skins sewed together: a coll.
gen. n., of which the n. un. is يَلَبَةٌ: 'Amr Ibn
Kulthoom says:
عَلَيْنَا البَيْضُ وَاليَلَبُ اليَمَانِى
وَأَسْيَافٌ يَقُمْنَ وَيَنْحَنِينَا
[Upon us (were) helmets, and leathern coats of
defence of the fabric of El-Yemen, and swords
that are straight (so accord. to the above reading,
of يَقُمْنَ, which I find in an excellent copy of
the S: but some read يُقَمْنَ, which, I think,
affords not so good a sense:) and that curve]:
(S:) or helmets made of camel's hides: [see also
أَلَبٌ and أَلَبَةٌ:] or [head-coverings made of]
plaited thongs of leather (نُسُوعٌ) woven together,
which are put on the head in lieu of the helmet:
(TA:) or skins which are sewed together, and
worn on the head, specially: (K:) or skins which
are worn beneath the [kind of coat called] دِرْع,
or [beneath that of] دِيبَاج; one of which is
called يَلَبَةٌ: or skins which are worn like the
coats of defence called دروع: or skins of which
such coats are made: (TA:) or any defensive
coverings, or armour, of skins; not of iron;
and hence, shields (دَرَقٌ) [of skins] are thus
called: a poet says,
عَلَيْهِمْ كُلُّ سَابِغَةٍِ دِلَاصٍ
وَفِى أَيْدِهِمِ اليَلَبُ المُدَارُ
[Upon them (are, or were,) all (kinds of) ample
coats of mail, smooth and glistening; and in
their hands, round shields of skins]: and يَلَبٌ,
originally is a name of that skin [of which such
coverings are made]: Aboo-Dahbal El-Jumahee
says,
دِرْعِى دِلَاصٌ شَكُّهَا شَكٌّ عَجَبْ
وَجَوْبُهَا القَاتِرُ مِنْ سَيْرِ الْيَلَبْ
[My coat of mail is smooth and glistening: its
cleaving (or sticking close) is an admirable cleaving: and its shield, of good dimensions, is of
strips of skin: so accord. to explanations in the
S, in arts. شك and قتر: but I incline to think
that جوبها here is the same as جَيْبُهَا; and that
a word is understood, which makes the meaning
to be its opening at the neck and bosom, of good
dimensions, is bordered with an edge of thongs]:
(S:) or simply skin, or hide. (K.) ―
-b2-  Also
defensive coverings, or armour, of pieces of felt
(لُبُود), with a stuffing of honey (عَسَل) and sand.
(K.) ―
-b3-  Also, Steel; (K;) pure iron: (ISh, T,
K:) n. un. يَلَبَةٌ. (TA.) Of this signification,
the following hemistich is cited as an ex.,
وَمِحْوَرٌ أَخْلَصُ مَن مَّاءِ اليَلَبَ
[And a pulley-axis clearer (in its brightness)
than the lustre of pure iron, or steel]: but ISk
says that it is by an Arab of the desert, who,
hearing the verse of 'Amr Ibn-Kulthoom quoted
above, erroneously supposed يلب to signify the
most excellent kind of iron; and IDrd also
asserts that the meaning assigned to it in this
hemistich is founded upon a mistake. (TA.)
See also أَلَبَةٌ. ―
-b4-  Also, Anything great, big, or
large in size. (K.)
