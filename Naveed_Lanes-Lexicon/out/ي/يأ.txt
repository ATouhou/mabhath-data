يَأْيَأَهُ, inf. n. يَأْيَأَهٌ and يَأْيَآءٌ, [respecting
the form of which latter see ظَأْظَأَ,] He made a
show of kindness, benignity, or favour to him.
(K.) ―
-b2-  إِنَّمَا هُوَ يَأْيَآءٌ [It is only making a show
of kindness, &c.: or, perhaps, He is only one
who makes a show of kindness, &c,]. (L.)
-A2-
يَأْيَأَ بِالقَوْمِ He called the people: (K: so too in
the L, and this is the correct meaning: TA:)
or he said to the people يَأَّيَأَّ, in order that they
should assemble, or collect together. (K) ―
-b2-
يَأْيَأَ بِالإِبِلِ He called to the camels by the cry
أَىْ, (whence the verb is formed by transposition,
TA,) to quiet them. (K.)
يَأْيَآءٌ The cry, or crying, of the bird called
يُؤْيُؤ. (K.) ―
-b2-  [See also the verb.] ―
-b3-  See art. أَيَا.
يُؤْيُؤٌ A certain bird (S, K) of prey, (S,)
resembling the [kind of hawk called] بَاشَق: (S,
K:) it is of the birds called صُقُور, [pl. of صَقْرٌ,]
as are also the بَازِى and the شَاهِين and the زُرَّق
and the بَاشَق: (AHát in TA, in art. بشق:)
accord. to Dmr, it is a small bird, short-tailed,
the temperament of which is, in comparison with
that of the باشق, cold and moist; for it is more
patient, or enduring, and heavier in motion:
the people of Egypt and Syria, he adds, call it
جَلَمٌ, on account of the lightness and swiftness
of its wings: (TA:) pl. يَأئِىُ, and, in a verse,
يَأئِىْ. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also, accord. to AA, The head,
or uppermost part, of a vessel in which كُحْل
(collyrium) is kept: mentioned before as called
بُؤْبُؤٌ, which is perhaps a mistake for يؤيؤ. (TA.)
