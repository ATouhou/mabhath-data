inf. n. of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, (M, K,) [used in
the sense of يُسْرٌ as explained above,] of the same
kind as [its contr.] مَعْسُورٌ; and Abu-l-Hasan
says, that this is the truth; for it has no unaugmented verb, and inf. ns. of this measure are not
of verbs which are in use, but only of imaginary
unaugmented triliteral-radical verbs, as in the case
of مَجْلُودٌ, which is [really] from تَجَلَّدَ. (M.)
For examples of يُسْرٌ, see عُسْرٌ. ―

and ↓ يُسْرَى signifies [the same; or] easy things
or affairs or circumstances; contr. of عُسْرَى; as
also ↓ مَيْسَرَةٌ. (TA, art. عسر.) You say also,
↓ أَنْظِرْنِى حَتَّى يَسَارِ [Grant thou me a delay until
I shall be in a state of easiness of circumstances,
&c.]; in which the last word is indecl., with
kesr for its termination, because it is altered from
the inf. n., which is المَيْسَرَةُ. (S.) In the Kur.
[ii. 280,] some read, ↓ فَنَظِرَةٌ إِلَى مَيْسُرِهِ [Then let
there be a postponement, or delay, until his being
in a state of easiness of circumstances]: but Akh
says, that this is not allowable; for there is no
noun of the measure مَفْعُلٌ [of this kind]: as to
مَكْرُمٌ and مَعُونٌ, [it is said that] they are pls.
[virtually though not in the language of the
grammarians] of مَكْرُمَةٌ and مَعُونَةٌ. (S.) [On

المُعَلَّى, which was the highest of them, having
[seven notches and] seven portions: the eighth
and ninth and tenth were called السَّفِيحُ and المَنِيحُ
and الوَغْدُ; and these three had no portions: [the
players to whom these three fell had to pay for
the slaughtered camel: (see المُسْبِلُ:) whence it
appears, that if the camel was divided into ten
portions, (see رَيْمٌ,) the game must have continued after all these were won, until it was seen
whose were the eighth and ninth and tenth arrows; and it seems to be the general opinion that
this was the case:] the camel being slaughtered,
they collected together the ten arrows, and put
them into the رِبَابَة, a thing resembling a quiver
(كِنَانَة), and turned them round about or shuffled
them (أَجَالُوهَا): [or they employed a person, whom
they called حُرْضَة, to do this:] then they put
them into the hand of the judge (الحَكَم), who
took them forth one after another in the name of
one after another of the party; [or they commissioned the حُرْضَه to do so;] and each took of
the portions of the slaughtered camel according
to his arrow; but those to whose lots fell the
arrows without portions were obliged to pay the
price of the slaughtered camel: with the flesh of
which they afterwards fed the poor; and him
who would not engage with them in the game
they reproached, and called a بَرَم: (Sefeenet Er-Rághib, printed at Boolák; p. 637:) [see also
رَقِيبٌ, and ضَرِيبٌ, and عَشْرٌ:] or any game of
hazard; or play for stakes, or wagers: (K:) so
that even the game of children with walnuts is
included under this name by Mujáhid in his explanation of verse 216 of chap. ii. of the Kur.:
(TA:) or anything in which is risk, or hazard:
(Kull, p. 321:) or the game of tricktrack, backgammon, or tables; syn. نَرْدٌ: (Sgh, K:) and
chess was called by 'Alee the مَيْسِر of the Persians,
or foreigners: (TA:) or the slaughtered camel
for which they played: for when they desired to
play, they bought on credit a camel for slaughter,
and slaughtered it, and divided it into twentyeight portions, or ten portions; and when one
[of the arrows] after another came forth [from
the رِبَابَة] in the name of one man after another,
the gain of him for whom came forth those to
which belonged portions appeared, and the fine
of him for whom came forth [any of the arrows
called] the غُفْل: (K:) so called as though it
were a place of division: and so used by the
poet Lebeed, who speaks of a fat مَيْسِر. (TA.)
