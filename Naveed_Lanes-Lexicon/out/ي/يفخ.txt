يفخ1
يَفَخَهُ, (K,) aor.
يَفَخَ, because of the guttural
letter, or
يَفُخَ, accord. to the common rule observed
in the K, or
يَفِخَ, as though it were of the same
class as وَعَدَ, (TA,) [the last is probably the
most correct form, as يَأْفِخُهُ is the aor. of أَفَخَهُ,
of which يَفَخَهُ is a dial. form,] He, or it, hit
him, or hurt him, on the part of his head called
the يَافُوخ. (K.)
يَافُوخٌ [The top of the head;] the part where
the anterior and posterior bones of the head
meet: [see يَأْفُوخٌ, of which it is a dial. form:]
pl. يَوَافِيخُ. (TA.) ISd regards this form of
pl. as an indication that the ى is a radical letter,
and therefore mentions it in this art.; (TA;)
[and F says the same in art. أفخ: but see that
art.]. ―
-b2-  مَسَّ بِيَافُوخِهِ السِّمَاكَ (assumed tropical:)  [He touched
Spica Virginis, or Arcturus, with the top of his
head]. (A.) ―
-b3-  وَطِئَ فُلَانٌ يَوَافِيخَ القُرُومِ (assumed tropical:)  Such
a one had lordship and eminence given to him.
(A.) ―
-b4-  صَدَعُوا يَافُوخَ اللَّيْلِ (tropical:)  i. q. أَدْلَجُوا [They
journeyed in the night; &c.] (A.) [See also
art. أفخ.]
مَيْفُوخٌ Hit, or hurt, on the part of his head
called the يَافُوخ. (K.)
يفع &c.
