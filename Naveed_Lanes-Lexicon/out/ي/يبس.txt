Msb, * TA) and يَبْسٌ (M) and يُبُوسَةٌ, (K [but

to the path of Moses, [to which the former of
the last two epithets is applied in the Kur.
xx. 79,] it had never been known as a path
either moist or dry, for God only showed it to
them created such; but the epithet is also read
with sukoon to the ب, because, though it had
not been a path, it was a place wherein had been
water and which had dried up: (K, TA:) the
latter reading is that of El-Hasan El-Basree:

say ↓ حَطَبٌ يَبْسٌ, dry fire-wood, as though it

away; or, as Az says, a path in which is no
moisture: (Msb:) [and ISd says,] ↓ يَبْسٌ and

of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure
فَاعِلٌ: (Msb:) or it is so applied to herbs, or
leguminous plants, of the sort termed أَحْرَار [that
