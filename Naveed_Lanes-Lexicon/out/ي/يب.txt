يَبَابٌ Vacant; in which there is nothing; (Sh;)
in which there is no one. (T.) أَرْضٌ يبابٌ A
land that is in a state of rain, or waste, uninhabited, depopulated, deserted, desolate, in a
state the contrary of flourishing: (S, K:) an
uninhabited land, accord. to some. (Msb.)
خَرَابٌ يبابٌ: in this case, the latter word is
merely an imitative sequent to the former: (Sh,
Msb:) or it is not so; (S;) [and therefore the
meaning is A very desolate waste, or the like;
يباب being added to strengthen the signification
of خراب: or merely a waste, or the like;
يباب being an explicative adjunct]. دَارُهُمْ خَرَابْ
يَبَابْ لَا حَارِسَ وَلَا بَابْ [Their dwelling is desolate,
vacant; there is (to it) neither guard nor door].
(A.) حَوْضٌ يبابٌ A tank, or cistern, that is
empty; containing no water. (A.) أَمْسَى مِنَ
الأَنِيسِ يبابًا It became devoid of inhabitants:
