يقتيَاقُوتٌ, [coll. gen. n., The sapphire, of whatever variety: the ruby, oriental ruby, or red
sapphire, also called ياقوتٌ أَحْمَرُ; of which there
are several varieties, whereof one is the carbuncle; also called ياقوتٌ جَمْرِىٌّ: the sapphire,
commonly so called, or blue sapphire, also called
ياقوتٌ أَزْرَقُ: and the topaz, oriental topaz, or
yellow sapphire, also called ياقوتٌ أَصْفَرُ: the
jacinth, or hyacinth, accord. to Golius, who
observes, as on the authority of the Teyfáshee,
that by this name are called various gems of
the East; four species thereof being enumerated;
the red, the yellow, or gold-coloured, the blue,
or azure, and the white: that the sapphire and
the chrysolite are also thus called: but that,
by the word used absolutely, the red jacinth,
or hyacinth, commonly called the ruby, is meant:
which last remark is agreeable with modern
usage:] a well known gem; (K;) of which
there are many varieties, (TA,) the most excellent
whereof is that called الياقوتُ الأَحْمَرُ الرُّمَّانِىُّ,
(K,) also called البَهْرَمَانِىُّ; [the finest kind of
ruby or carbuncle;] said to be brought from
Sarandeeb [or Ceylon]: it has the property
of exhilarating, and of conjoining [separated
friends]; (TA;) and is profitable for disturbance
of the mind (occasioned by the black bile, TA)
and palpitation, and weakness of the heart and
stomach, if drunk; [being app. reduced to
powder for that purpose, as is done with some
other gems in the East;] and for congealment
of the blood, if hung [upon the person]: (K:)
it is a Persian word, (S,) arabicized: (S, K:)
of the measure فَاعُولٌ: n. un. with ة; and pl.
يَواقِيتُ. (S.)
