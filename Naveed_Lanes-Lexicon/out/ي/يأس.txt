يأس1
يَئِسَ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) مِنَ الشَّىْءِ, (S,
A *, Msb,) aor. يَيْئَسُ and يَيْئِسُ, (S, M, Msb, K,)
the latter of which is extr., (Sb, S, M, K,)
like يَحْسِبُ, aor. of حَسِبَ, and يَنْعِمُ, aor. of نَعِمَ,
(As, S, TA,) and is of the dial. of the higher
classes of Mudar, as are also the similar instances, but the former is of the dial. of the
lower classes of the Mudar; (AZ, S, Msb, TA;)
or, as Sb says, accord. to his companions, the
verb was originally of two forms, يَئِسَ, aor.
يَيْئَسُ, and يَأَسَ, aor. يَيْئِسُ, and a compound
[which is يَئِسَ having يَيْئِسُ for its aor.] was
then formed from the two; but as to وَمِقَ, aor.
يَمِقُ, and وَفِقَ, aor. يَفِقُ, and وَرِمَ. aor. يَرِمُ, and
وَلِىَ, aor. يَلِى, and وَثِقَ, aor. يَثِقُ, and وَرِثَ, aor.
يَرِثُ, in each of these only one form is allowable,
with the kesr; (S, TA;) and some change the
second ى of the aor. of يَئِسَ into ا, and say
يَايَسُ and يَآءَسُ; (Mbr, S, TA;) and I'Ab reads,
in the Kur. xii. 87, يِيئَسُ, after the manner of
the dial. of those who pronounce the first letter
of the aor. with kesr excepting such as is with
ى [for its first letter], (K, TA,) which dial, is
that of Temeem and Keys and Hudheyl and
Asad; (Ks, Lh, TA;) the case of ى being
made an exception by them because kesr with
that letter is difficult of pronunciation; (Sb,
TA;) but some of the Benoo-Kelb pronounce
ى also with kesr, which is extr.; (Fr, Lb, TA:)
and this is done in the instances of يِيئَسُ and
يِيجَلُ because one ى is here strengthened by
another; (K, TA;) [I find also, in a copy of
the M, يَئِيسُ, as an extr. form of the aor. of this
verb, on the authority of Sb; but it is doubtless
a mistranscription for يِيئَسُ; and there is another
evident mistranscription in a quotation from Sb
immediately following in that copy, relating to
aors. of the form of يِيئَسُ, which has been rendered correctly above, in the present work, from the
TA;] inf. n. يَأْسٌ (S, M, A, Msb, K) and يَأَسٌ,
(TA,) or يَآسٌ, (as in a copy of the M,) and يَآسَةٌ;
(Ibn-'Abbád, M, K, TA [but in a MS. copy of the
K I find it written يَأَسَةٌ; and in the CK, يَأْسَة;])
and إِيَاسٌ is also used as an inf. n. of this verb,
though properly an inf. n. of 4; (Msb;) He
despaired of the thing; syn. of the inf. n.
قُنُوط, (S, A, K,) contr. of رَجَآءٌ: (M, A, K:)
or he cut off hope of the thing: (A, K: *) or
his hope of the thing became cut off: (Mgh:)
and ↓ إِسْتَيْئَسَ signifies the same, (S, A, K,)
in like manner followed by مَنْ; (S;) and so
does ↓ إِتَّأَسَ, (S, K,) [originally إِيتَأَسَ,] of the
measure إِفْتَعَلَ, but with incorporation [of the
ى into the ت]. (S.) It is allowable to transpose the letters of يَئِسَ, so as to say أَيِسَ; but
not those of the inf. n. (Msb.) There is not a
word in the Arabic language commencing with
ى followed by ء except يَئِسَ [and its derivatives]
(IKtt) [and يَأَيَأَ and its derivatives, and words
commencing with an augmentative ى followed
by a radical
يَاُ^َ]. The expression لَا يَأْسَ مِنْ طُولٍ.
occurring in a description of Mohammad, means
that his stature was such as would not make
[one] to despair of his height; for he was nearer
to tallness than he was to shortness: (K, * TA:)
يأس is here an indeterminate noun governed in
the accus. case by the negative لا: (TA:) or,
accord. to one relation, the words are, لَا يَائِسَ
مِنْ طُولٍ, [in the CK, erroneously, لا يايَسُ,]
meaning, that his height was not despaired of;
i. e., he who vied with him in tallness would not
despair of him on account of his excessive
height: (K, TA:) so that يَائِس is here in the
sense of مَيْؤُوس, like مَآءٌ دَافِقٌ in the sense of
مَدْفُوقٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] يَئِسَتْ المَرْأَهُ The
woman was, or became, barren. (Msb.) ―
-b3-
يَئِسَ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) aor. يَيْئَسُ and يَيْئِسُ,
(M,) also signifies (tropical:)  He knew; syn. عَلِمَ; (S,
M, A, Msb, K;) in the dial. of En-Nakha';
(S, Msb;) or, accord. to El-Kelbee, (M,) or
Ibn-El-Kelbee, (TA,) in the dial. of Wahbeel,
a tribe of En-Nakha'; or, accord. to El-Kásim
Ibn-Maan, of the dial. of Hawázin. (M, TA.)
So in the Kur. [xiii. 30] أَفَلَمْ يَيْئَسِ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا
[Do not then those who have believed know?]:
(S, M, Msb, K:) or, accord. to some of the
lexicologists, do not then those who have believed
know with a knowledge wherewith they despair
of its being otherwise than what they know? or
the meaning is, do not then those who have
believed despair of the belief of those whom
God has described as those who will not believe?
(M, TA;) but I' Ab (M, TA) and 'Alee and
others (TA) used to read أَفَلَمْ يَتَبَيَّنِ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا;
and I'Ab said that he thought that the writer
had written يَيْئَس in a state of drowsiness. (M *,
TA.) Soheym Ibn-Wetheel El-Yarboo'ee also
uses the verb in this sense, in a verse cited in
art. يسر, voce يَسَرَ, q. v. (S, M *). [Z-says,] You
say, قَدْ يَئِسْتُ أَنَّكَ رَجُلُ صِدْقٍ, meaning, (tropical:)  I have
known [that thou art a good man], because
with eager desire is restlessness, and with
the cessation thereof is quiet and tranquility;
wherefore it is said, اليَأْسُ أَحَدُ الرَّاحَتَيْنِ [Despair is one of the two states of rest.] (A,
TA.)
4
أَيْأَسَهُ, (S, M, A, Mgh, K,) inf. n. إِيَاسٌ,
(L, Mgh, Msb,) of the same measure as كِتَابٌ,
(Msb,) originally إِيْآسٌ, (L, Msb,) like إِيْعَاسٌ,
(L,) and إِيْمَانٌ, (Msb,) He made him to despair:
(S, M, A, K:) or to cut off hope: (A:) or
to cease to have hope: (Mgh:) مَنْ كَذَا of such
a thing: (S:) as also ↓ آيَسَهُ [from أَيِسَ]. (Mgh,
K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] أَيْأُسَهَا اللّٰهُ God made her to be,
or become, barren. (Msb.)

إِسْتَيْاَ^َ see 1.
يَأَسٌ Phthisis, or consumption; syn. سِلٌّ;
(M, K;) because he who is affected by it is
despaired of; (M;) or [because] the first who
was affected by it was اليَأَسُ, (K, TA,) or
إِلْيَاس, (TA,) the son of Mudar the son of Nizár:
(K, TA:) or, as Suh says, in the R, this
disease was called دَآءُ يَاس, or دَآءُ إِلْيَاسَ, because
الياس the son of Mudar died of it. (TA.)
يَؤُسٌ: see يَائِسٌ.
يَؤُوسٌ: see يَائِسٌ.
يَئِيسٌ: see يَائِسٌ.
يَائِسٌ (M, Mgh, Msb) and ↓ يَئِيس (M) and
↓ يَؤُوسٌ (S, M, A, K) and ↓ يَؤُسٌ (M, K) Despairing: (S, M, A, Mgh, K:) but the third has
an intensive signification, (Bd, xli. 49,) [and
so the last.]
يَائِسَةٌ, A barren woman. (Msb.)
مَيْؤُوسٌ مِنْهُ Despaired of. (M, Mgh, Msb. *)
