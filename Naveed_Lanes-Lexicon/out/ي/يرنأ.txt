يرنأQ. 1
يَرْنَأَ لِحْيَتَهُ (K, TA; in the CK, [erroneously,] تَرَنَّأَ;) He dyed his beard with يرنّأ.
(K.) A strange verb as to its form, (K,) which
[except in its final vowel] is that of an aorist,
though it is a preterite. (TA.) Mentioned in
the L in art. رنأ (q. v.), on the authority of IJ;
and there also by ISd; and AHei and others
assert the ى to be augmentative. [If so, the
verb is a quasi-quadriliteral-radical word.] F
follows Sgh, in mentioning it here. (TA.)
يُرَنَّأٌ (S, K) and يَرَنَّأٌ and يُرَنَّآءٌ (K) and يُرَنَّا
(without ء) and (accord. to [the Bári', as mentioned in] the TA, art. رنأ,) يَرْنَأٌ and يُرْنَأٌ and
(accord. to MF, who omits the two forms here
immediately preceding,) يَرَنَّاءٌ and يَرَنَّا, without ء,
(TA,) i. q. حِنَّاءٌ (S, K) [The plant Lawsonia
inermis]. See also art. رنأ, where the word is
written [erroneously in my opinion] يَرُنَّأٌ. Accord.
to IB (not IJ [as in the CK]), the may only
be omitted when the word is pronounced with
dammeh to the ى. (TA.)
