لمز1
لَمَزَهُ, aor.
لَمِزَ and
لَمُزَ, inf. n. لَمْزٌ, He made a sign
to him with the eye, or the like, (S, A, * Msb, K,)
as the head, and the lip, with low speech. (TA.)
This is the original signification. (S, Msb, TA.)
―
-b2-  Hence, (S, Msb, TA,) He blamed, upbraided,
or reproached, him; he found fault with him:
(S, Msb, K:) or he did so in his face: (TA:) or
he met him with blaming, upbraiding, reproaching
or finding fault: (IKtt, TA:) or he spoke evil
of him, or spoke of him in a manner that he disliked, mentioning vices or faults as chargeable to
him, either behind his back or before his face,
though it might be with truth; syn. إِغْتَابَهُ. (TA.)
The two forms of the aor. occur in readings of
the words of the Kur., [ix. 58,] وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَلْمِزُكَ
فِى الصَّدَقَاتِ and يَلْمُزُكَ, (S, TA,) And of them
are those who blame thee with respect to the
division of the alms: (Bd, Jel:) and Ibn-Ketheer
reads ↓ يُلَامِزُكَ. (Bd.)
-A2-  لَمَزَهُ, (Ks, S,) aor
لَمِزَ, (S,)
inf. n. لَمْزٌ, (S, A, K,) He pushed him, or impelled
him, or repelled him: (Ks, T, S, A, K:) said by
AM to be the primary signification: (TA:) and
he struck him, or beat him. (S, A, K.)

رَأَيْتُهُ يُلَاغِزُهُ وَيُلَامِرُهُ [means I saw him talking
enigmatically with him, or to him, and making
signs with him, or to him: or, accord. to the TA,
مُلَامَزَةٌ is syn. with مُلَاغَزَةٌ]. (A, in art. لغز.)
لُمَزَةٌ One who blames, upbraids, reproaches, or
finds fault with, others, much, or habitually;
(S, K;) as also ↓ لَمَّازٌ, (so in two copies of the
S, and in a copy of the A,) or ↓ لَمَازٌ, like سَحَابٌ:
(K:) لُمَزَةٌ is applied to a man and to a woman;
for its ة is to denote intensiveness, and not the
fem. gender: (TA:) هُمَزَةٌ and لُمَزَةٌ signify the
same; (ISk, Zj, K;) i. e., one who speaks evil of
others, or does so in their absence, though it may
be with truth; (يَغْتَابُهُمْ; and this may mean
[who detracts by making signs] with the side of
the mouth, or with the eye, or with the head;
TA;) and defames them; (ISk, Zj, TA;) or one
who often goes about with calumny, a separater of
companions and friends: (Abu-l-'Abbás, TA:)
and ↓ لَمَّازٌ, like شَدَّادٌ, a frequent, or habitual,
calumniator, or slanderer: (TA:) or هُمَزَةٌ and
لُمَزَةٌ differ in signification; the latter signifying
one who blames, upbraids, reproaches, or finds
fault with, thee to thy face; and the former, one
who does so in thine absence; (K;) and Lth
says the like: (TA:) or the latter, one who
speaks evil of others, though it may be with truth,
(مُغْتَابٌ,) behind the back; and the former, one
who does so to the face: or the latter, one who
speaks against the lineages of men; and the former,
one who speaks against the characters of men:
or the latter, [one who reproaches] with the tongue;
and the former, with the eye: or the reverse:
(K [but omitted in the CK], TA:) or the latter
signifies one who excites discord, or animosity,
between two persons. (TA.) See also هُمَزَةٌ. And
see the Ksh and Bd in civ. 1.
لَمَازٌ: see لُمَزَةٌ.
لَمَّازٌ [One who makes frequent signs with the
eye, or the like: fem. with ة: see one ex. voce
رَمَّازٌ]. ―
-b2-  See also لُمَزَةٌ, in two places.
لَامِزٌ act. part. n. of 1. ―
-b2-  لُمَّازٌ [its pl.] Persons
who speak evil of others, though it may be with
truth, (مُغْتَابُونَ,) in their presence. (IAar, TA.)
