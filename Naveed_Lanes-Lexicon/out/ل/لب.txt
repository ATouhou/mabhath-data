لب1
لَبڤ3َ [لَبَّ, originally لَبِبَ,] sec. per. لَبِبْتَ, (S, K,)
the most common form of the verb, (TA,) and
[لَبَّ, originally لَبُبَ, like حَبَّ, originally حَبُبَ,
q. v.,] sec. pers. لَبُبْتَ, aor. يَلَبُّ, (S, K,) in the
dial. of El-Hijáz, deviating from rule as aor. of
the latter form of the verb; (TA;) inf. n. لَبَابَةٌ
(S, K) and لِبٌّ and لَبٌّ; (TA;) and لَبَّ, aor.
يَلِبُّ, in the dial. of Nejd; like فَرَّ, aor. يَفِرُّ;

(S, K.) It has been said by some (as the
authors of the T, the S, &c.) that لَبُبْتَ, aor. تَلَبُّ,
has not its like among the class of reduplicative
verbs; i. e., in being of the measure فَعُلَ in the
pret., and يَفْعَلُ in the aor.: but three similar
verbs have been mentioned; namely, دَمُمْتَ,
شَرُرْتَ, and عَزُزَتِ الشَّاةُ (meaning “ the ewe, or
goat, became scant in her milk ”). (TA.) [This,
however, is a mistake: the assertion relates to
لَبُبْتَ having for its aor. (regularly) تَلُبُّ: see
دَمَّ, aor. يَدُمُّ.])

R. Q. 1
لَبْلَبَةٌ, [inf. n. of لَبْلَبَ,] The being
tender, affectionate, kind, or compassionate, to
offspring. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  لَبْلَبَتْ عَلَى وَلَدِهَا, inf. n.
as above, She (a ewe) was tender, or affectionate, to
her young one, and licked it, when she brought it
forth, (S, K,) making a sound like لِبْ لِبْ. (TA.)
―
-b3-  See 1. ―
-b4-  لَبْلَبَ عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. as above, He
was kind, or compassionate, to him; i. e., to a man:
he was kind, or affectionate, to him, and aided, or
succoured, him. (TA.)
-A2-  لَبْلَبَ It was separated,
dispersed, or scattered. (AA, T, K.) (The inf. n.,
لبلبة, is explained by تَفَرُّقٌ: but I think it not
improbable that this is a mistake for تَرَفُّقٌ; and
that the meaning is, He was gentle, courteous,
or kind.]
لَبٌّ inf. n. of لَبَّ “ he remained, &c. ” ―
-b2-  لبَّيْكَ
[At thy service! lit., Doubly at thy service!]
(S, K, &c.) and لَبَّيْهِ [At his service: &c.]. (TA.)
[See an ex. voce مَرْهُوبٌ. It is used in the
present day like our phrase At thy service, and
may well be thus rendered, or with the addition
of time after time.] لبّيك is derived from أَلَبَّ
[or rather from لَبَّ as syn. with البّ] “ he
remained &c. ”; and means I wait intent upon
thy service, or upon obedience to thee: (Fr,
S, K;) waiting [at they service] after waiting;
[i. e., time after time;] and answering [thy
commands] after answering: (K:) it [i. e. the
noun without the annexed pron.] is put in the
acc. case as an inf. n. [used as an absolute
complement of its own verb which is understood],
as in حَمْدًا لِلّٰهِ وشُكْرًا; and the right way would
be to say لَبًّا لَكَ; but it is put in the dual number
for the sake of corroboration; meaning إِلْبَابًا
بِكَ بَعْدَ إِلْبَابٍ, and إِقَامَةً بَعْدَ إِقَامَةٍ, [waiting at
thy service, or in attendance upon thee, or in thy
presence, after waiting, or time after time]. (Fr,
S.) [See also the similar expression سَعْدَيْكَ.]
Or لَبٌّ signifies the obeying, or serving; or
obedience, or service; from the original signification of the “ remaining, staying, abiding,
or dwelling,” [in a place]: the dual, in the nom.
case, is لَبّانِ; and in the acc. and gen., لَبَّيْنِ;
and the original meaning of لبيك is I have obeyed
thee, or served thee, twice: [or I do obey thee,
&c.:] the ن [of لبّين] being elided because of
its being prefixed to the pron. (IAar.) Or
لبّيك is from the saying دَارُ فُلَانٍ تَلُبُّ دَارِى “ the
house of such a one faces my house ”; (Kh, S,
K;) and the meaning is I present myself before
thee, (or repair to thee, K,) doing what thou
likest, answering thee [after answering, or time
after time]: the ى is to form the dual number;
and indicates that the noun is in the acc. case
as an inf. n. [used as mentioned above]. (Kh,
S.) Or it means My love [is given] to thee;
from the expression اِمْرَأَةٌ لَبَّةٌ “ a woman loving
(and affectionate, TA,) to her husband ”: so in
the K: but the expression, as related on the
authority of Kh, is أُمٌّ لَبَّةٌ; which is confirmed
by a verse that he cites. (TA.) Or the meaning
is إِخْلَاصِى لَكَ [My sincere service, or the like,
(is given) to thee;] from the expression حَسَبٌ لُبَابٌ
“ pure nobility, or the like. ” (K.) Accord. to
Yoo, لبّيك is a noun in the sing. number with
the pron. annexed to it: this noun is originally
لَبَّبٌ, of the measure فَعْلَلٌ: (not of the measure
فَعَّلٌ, because this is rare in the language:) the
the last ب is changed into ى to avoid the reduplication; and thus it becomes لَبَّىٌ: then the
ى, being movent, and immediately preceded by
fet-hah, is changed into ا; and it becomes لَبَّا
[or لَبَّى, for the ى in this case is called ا]: then,
being conjoined with ك in لبّيك, and with ه in
لبّيه, its ا is changed into ى; after the same
manner as you say إِلَيْكَ and عَلَيْكَ and لَدَيْكَ.
(TA.) [But see what here follows.] ―
-b3-  لَبَّىْ
يَدَيْكَ is a phrase exactly similar to لبّيك, meaning
At the service (or, lit. doubly at the service) of
thy hands! and this is said, in the S, art. لبى
to be at variance with the opinion of Yoo, given
above; for, if لبّى were similar to إِلَى &c.,
being prefixed to a noun, not a pron., it would
be لَبَّى يَدَيْكَ, not لَبَّىْ.] Accord. to El-Khattá-
bee, لبّى يديك signifies May thy hands be safe
and sound! the desinential syntax being disregarded in the saying يديك, which rightly
should be يَدَاكَ, in order that يديك may match
in sound with لبّيك: but Z says, that the meaning
is, I will obey thee, and be at thy free disposal,
as a thing which thou shalt dispose of with thy
hands in whatever manner thou shalt please.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  In like manner you say لَبَّىْ زَيْدٍ [At
the service (or doubly at the service) of Zeyd].
(Msb.) See art. لبى. ―
-b5-  لَبِّ, with kesreh for
its termination, like أَمْس and غَاقِ, is also related
as having been used: (Sb:) [and it is still used
in some parts, as signifying At thy service!].
-A2-
لَبٌّ keeping, or adhering, [to a thing]: remaining,
or staying. (K.) ―
-b2-  A camel-driver who keeps
constantly to the work of driving the camels, not
leaving them. (TA.) ―
-b3-  رَجُلٌ لَبٌّ A man who
keeps to a thing, or affair, or business; as also
↓ لَبِيبٌ; (S, K;) a man who keeps to his art, or
craft, or trade, not ceasing from it. (TA.)
―
-b4-  رجلٌ لَبٌّ طَبٌّ A man who keeps to business,
[and is skilful, expert, clever, or intelligent].
(S, TA.)
-A3-  لَب One who renders himself near
to people by affection and friendship [or is friendly
and affectionate to them]: courteous, polite, or
affable: fem. لَبَّةٌ: pl. لِبَابٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  اِمْرَأَةٌ لَبَّةٌ
A woman who renders herself near by affection
and friendship [or is friendly and affectionate],
to people; (S;) courteous, polite, or affable:
(S, K:) a woman loving to her husband; (K;)
affectionate to him: or, accord. to Kh, the
expression is أُمٌّ لَبَّةٌ: see لَبٌّ, above. (TA.)
لُبٌّ (S, K) and ↓ لُبَابٌ (Msb) of a nut, an almond,
and the like, What is in the inside; (S;) the heart,
or kernel: (K:) of a palm-tree, the heart, or pith,
called قَلْبٌ or قُلْبٌ. (S, K.) Pl. of the former
لُبُوبٌ. (S.) ―
-b2-  لُبٌّ (S, K) and ↓ لُبَابٌ (TA) What
is pure, or the choice, or best, part, of anything:
(S, K:) pl. of the former أَلْبَابٌ. (A'Obeyd.)
―
-b3-  لُبُّ الحِنْطَةِ [The purest substance of wheat:
see فَالُوذٌ:] (T, L, art. فلذ &c:) [also called
البُرِّ ↓ لُبَابُ, acc. to Sprenger, “Life of Mohammad,” (Allahabad, 1851,) p. 24, note 1.] ―
-b4-
[Hence,] لُبٌّ of a man, (TA,) (tropical:)  Understanding;
intellect; intelligence; or mind; syn. عَقْلٌ: (S,
K:) the understanding, &c., that is put into the
heart of a man: so called because it is the
choicest or best part of him: or it is not so
called unless it is pure from cupidity, or lust,
and foul imaginations; and therefore has a
more special sense than عقل: so in the Keshf
el-Keshsháf: (TA:) pl. أَلْبَابٌ, and sometimes
أَلُبٌّ; (S, K;) like as أَبْؤُسٌ is pl. of بُؤْسٌ, and
أَنْعُمٌ of نُعْمٌ; (S;) and أَلْبُبٌ; (S, K;) the last
being used, without incorporating the second ب
into the first, in case of necessity in poetry. (S.)
―

sources of tenderness, affection, kindness, or compassion. (S, K.) ―

asked her why she did not curse him. (S.) ―
-b7-
أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ بَنَاتَ أَلْبُبِهِ He loved it. (L, art. شر.)

-b8-  The following words of the poet,
قَدْ عَلِمَتْ ذَاكَ بَنَاتُ أَلْبُبِهْ
signify, accord. to the M, My intellect knew
that. (TA.) El-Mubarrad read أَلْبَبِهْ in the
above words of the poet: (TA:) the meaning of
these words, accord. to him, is, The daughters of
the most intelligent of his tribe knew this. (S,
TA.) ―
-b9-  If you form a pl. from [the pl.] أَلْبُبٌ,
it is أَلَابِبُ; and the dim. n. is أُلَيْبِبٌ. (S.)
―

where camels are stabbed: he who says that it

just beneath the throat:] pl. of the former

harm, No harm. Syn. لَا بَأْسَ. (K.) ISd thinks
it to be from a preceding meaning; [that of

an imp. verbal n., like نَزَالِ &c., meaning keep

فَقُلْتُ لَهَا فِيئِى إِلَيْكِ فَإِنَّنِى
حَرَامٌ وَإِنِّى بَعْدَ ذَاكِ لَبِيبُ
by بعد ذاك is meant مع ذاك; and by لبيب,
مُقِيم, (remaining, or staying,) or, accord. to some,
مُلَبٍّ, from التَّلْبِيَة: see art. لبى. (S.)
لَبَابَةٌ: see لَبَابٌ.
لِبَابَةٌ What is worn by the مُتَلَبِّب [app. meaning
him who girds himself, and raises or tucks up
his clothes, and arms himself, for fight]: (TA:)
[A garment which he who prepares himself for
fight puts on over other garments. (Freytag.)

(S:) [a species of dolichos, the dolichos lablab
of Linn.: accord. to Golius, as from the S,
convolvulus, a herb which as it rises embraces
a tree: and he adds, pecul., the helxine: (Diosc.
iv., 39, Beith:) either as if لفلاف, from لف;
or from the love with which it seems to embrace the tree; whence it is also called عشقة
[q. v.], and is a symbol of love which endures after
death.] A well-known herb, or leguminous plant,
(بقلة, q. v.,) used medicinally. (TA.) See عُصْرٌ.
لَوْلَبٌ A large quantity of water, which, when
the aperture (مَفْتَح, as in the T; or فَتْح, as in
MS. copies of the K; in the CK فُتُح;) [mean-
ing the aperture of the tank or the like] carries
off thereof what it can, and the hole by which it
runs out (صُنْبُورُهُ, meaning the مَثْعَب of the water,
TA,) is too narrow to admit it freely on account
of its abundance, whirls round, and becomes like
the spout of a vessel. (T, K.) AM says, I
know not whether it be an Arabic word or
arabicized; but the people of El-'Irák are fond
of using it. (TA.) [It appears to be from the
Persian لُولَهْ, as Golius thinks; and is used in
modern Arabic in several other senses; namely,
A tube through which water flows: the spout of
a ewer, of an alembic, and the like: a cock, or
tap: a turning pin, or peg; a screw: and the
like. Its more appropriate place, I think, would
be in an art. composed of the letters للب (accord.
to what is said of مُلَوْلَبٌ in the S, K); or rather,
(accord. to its derivation from the Pers.,) لولب.]
Pl. لَوَالِبُ. (TA.)
