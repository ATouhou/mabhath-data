Msb, K) and لَوَاذٌ and لُوَاذٌ, (Msb, K,) He had
recourse to it, (a mountain [&c.], Msb,) or him,
for refuge or protection or preservation; (S, A, L,
Msb;) as also به ↓ لاوذ, inf. n. لِوَاذٌ; (A;) and
به ↓ الاذ; (Msb;) sought, or took, refuge in it, or
him; (S, L;) and joined himself to him; and
sought, desired, implored, or called for, aid, or succour, of him: (L:) he protected, concealed, defended,
or fortified himself by it, (L, K,) or him; (L;)
as also به ↓ لاوذ, (L,) inf. n. مُلَاوَذَةٌ (L, K) and
لِوَاذٌ; (L;) and ↓ الاذ. (L.) ―
-b2-  لَاذَ بِهِ, (L,) inf. n.
as above, in the commencement of the art., (K,)
It encompassed, or surrounded, it; (L, K; *) as
also ↓ الاذ, (L,) inf. n. إِلَاذَةٌ. (L, K.) You say,
لَاذَ الطَّرِيقُ بِالدَّارِ, and ↓ الاذ, The road encompassed, or surrounded, the house: (L:) or, reached,

بِهِم ↓ الاذ, He laboured, or strove, to overcome
the people in any way; expl. by the words
هى المداورة من حيث ماكان. (T, L.) [Perhaps
المداورة is a mistake for المُدَارَاة; see 3: the
same phrases being explained in the M by دَاَراهُمْ:
but there is a near resemblance between the
significations of المداورة and المداراة.]

لاوذ القَوْمُ, (S, L,) inf. n. مُلَاوَذَةٌ and لِوَاذٌ,
(S, L, K,) with which تَلْوَاذٌ is syn., (K,) The
people had recourse, one to another, for refuge or
protection or preservation; sought, or took, refuge,
one in another; protected, concealed, defended, or
fortified, themselves, one by another. (S, L, K. *)
Agreeably with this explanation, (as some say,
L,) لِوَاذًا is used in the Kur, xxiv. 63: were it
from لَاذَ, it would be لِيَاذًا. (S, L.) ―
-b2-  See 1. ―
-b3-
لاوذ بِهِمْ, inf. n. مُلَاوَذَةٌ, He went round about
them, or encompassed them. (Msb.) See also 1.

syn. دَارَاهُمْ. (M, L.) لاوذ He eluded, and shunned,

مراوغة, some render لِوَاذًا in the Kur, xxiv. 63.
(Ibn-Is-Seed, TA.) ―

differently from, or adversely to, him; was, or
became contrary to, or different from, or adverse
to, him; (L, * K, * TK;) syn. خَالَفَهُ, (TK,) inf. n.
خِلَافٌ. (L, K.) Agreeably with this explanation,
Zj renders لِوَاذًا in the Kur, xxiv. 63; saying
that the meaning which he thus assigns to it is
shown to be the true one by the words immediately
following. (L.)
