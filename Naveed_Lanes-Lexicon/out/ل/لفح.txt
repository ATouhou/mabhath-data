لفح1
لَفَحَتْهُ النَّارُ, (S, M, K,) aor.
لَفَحَ, (M,) inf. n.
لَفْحٌ and لَفَحَانٌ, (M, K,) The fire smote, or hurt,
his face; as also لفحت وَجْهَهُ: (M, O:) the fire
burned him; (TA;) as also نفحته النار بِحَرِّهَا;
(S, K;) and in like manner the hot wind called
سَمُوم: (S:) لَفَحَتْ and نَفَحَتْ are syn., except
that the effect of النَّفْح is greater than that of
اللَّفْح: (Zj:) or لَفْحٌ relates to a hot wind; and
نَفْحٌ, to a cold, or cool, wind: (As, S:) you also
say لفحته السَّمُوم meaning the سموم blew in his face.
(L.) ―
-b2-  Also لَفَحَهُ, aor.
لَفَحَ, He smote, or struck,
him, with a sword, (S, K,) lightly, or slightly:
you say لَفَحْتُهُ بِالسَّيْفِ لَفْحَةً I struck him with
the sword a light, or slight, blow. (S.)
أَصَابَهَ لفْحٌ مِنْ حَرُورٍ وَسَمُومٍ A burning gust of
hot night-wind, and of hot day-wind, smote him.
(L.) ―
-b2-  أَصَابَهُ مِنَ الحَرِّ لَفْحٌ وَمِنَ البَرْدِ نَفْحٌ [A
blast of heat smote him, and a blast of cold]. (A.)
―
-b3-  You say also لَوَافِحُ السَّمُوِم [pl. of ↓ لَافِحَةٌ,
and meaning Burning blasts of the سموم]. (S,
K in art. سفع.)
لَفْحَةٌ A light, or slight, blow with a sword. (S.)
لُقَّاحٌ A certain well known plant, (K,) of the
kind termed يَقْطِينِىٌّ, (L,) which people smell, (S.)
yellow, and of sweet odour, (A, L,) resembling the
بَاذِنْجَان (S, A, K,) when it becomes yellow;
(S, A;) [accord. to Golius, app. on the authority
of Ibn-Beytár, the same which the Syrians and
Egyptians call شَمَّامٌ, q. v.]. ―
-b2-  Also, The fruit,
or produce, (ثَمَرَة,) of the يَبْرُوح [or mandrake,
which is called by this name (يبروح) in the
present day]; (K;) thus correctly written, with
the ى before the ب [not ببروح, as in the CK
and some MS. copies]. (TA.) [It seems that
the application of the term لفّاح to both the mandrake and the شمّام has led to confusion, and
occasioned Linnæus to call the latter “ cucumis
dudaim. ” See also يَبْرُوحٌ, and مَغْدٌ.]
