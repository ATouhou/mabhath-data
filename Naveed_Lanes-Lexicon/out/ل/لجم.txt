تَلَجَّمَتْ: see 10 in art. ثفر.
لُجَمٌ: see لُجْمَةٌ.
لُجْمَةٌ and ↓ لِجَامٌ A thing from which one augurs
evil; an omen, or a bodement, of evil: because
it refrains one from a thing that he wants. (A,
art. عطس.) ↓ لُجَمٌ, which is originally the plural
of both, is also used as a sing. (A, ibid, where
see an ex.) See عَطَسَ and عَطُوسٌ.
لِجَامٌ [A bit; i. e., the iron appurtenances of
a bridle]. To the لجام belong pieces of iron
which are fastened one to another; as the
عِضَادَتَانِ, and the مِسْحَل, and the فَأْس and
its extremities of iron. (Az, in TA, voce قَيْقَبٌ.)
The above explanation is incomplete: it means
the bridle, or headstall and reins, with the bit
and other appurtenances; like its Persian original, لِكَامْ: see قَرَّطَ. It signifies The piece of
iron in the mouth of the horse: thus, by extension, applied to this with its thongs, or straps,
and apparatus: it comprises the شَكِيمَة, which
is the transverse piece of iron in the mouth; and
the فَأْس, which is the piece of iron standing up
in the mouth; and the مِسْحَل, which is the iron
beneath the حَنَك; and the خُطَّافَانِ, which are two
bent pieces of iron in the مِسْحَل and the شكيمة,
on the right and left; and the فَرَاشَتَانِ, which
are two pieces of iron wherewith are fastened
the extremities of the عِذَارَانِ; and the حَكَمَة,
which is the ring surrounding the مَرْسَِن and the
حَنَك, of silver or iron or thong. (IDrd, in his
Book on the Saddle and Bridle.)
