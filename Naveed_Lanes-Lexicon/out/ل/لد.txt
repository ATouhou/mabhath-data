(L, K:) the أ in ↓ أَلَنْدَدٌ and the ى in ↓ يَلَنْدَدٌ
are letters of quasi-coördination, [i. e., added to
render those two words quasi-coordinate to
سَفَرْجَلٌ,] as is shown by the two dáls being not
incorporated by idghám; for it is allowable to
add a letter at the beginning of a word for the
purpose of quasi-coördination when the word has
another augmentative letter: (IJ, L:) the dim.
of ↓ أَلنْدَدٌ is ↓ أُلَيْدُّ, because it is originally أَلَدُّ,
the ن being added to render it quasi-coördinate
to سَفَرْجَلٌ. (S, L.) قَوْمًا لُدًّا in the Kur,
[xix. 97,] is said to signify A people who are
adversaries perverted from the truth: or, who
