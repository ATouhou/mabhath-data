لوت1
لَاتَ, aor. يَلُوتُ, He told, narrated, or gave
an account of, a thing different from that respecting which he was asked. (K.) [But accord. to some, the aor. is يَلِيتُ, and the verb
belongs to art. ليت.] It was said to ElAsadeeyeh, “What is المُدَاحَلَةُ ” and she
answered أَنْ يَلِيتَ الإِنْسَانُ شَيْئًا قَدْ عَلِمَهُ, i. e.,
“ The concealing a thing that one knows, and
telling, or narrating, something different from
it. ” (TA.) ―
-b2-  لَاتَ الخَبَرَ, aor. يَلُوتُ, He concealed the news, or information, (K,) and related
what was different therefrom. (TA.) [But see
above.] ―
-b3-  لَاتَ الرَّجُلَ, aor. يَلُوتُ, He told the
man, or narrated to him, a thing in a manner
different from the real state of the case: or he expressed the news, or information, to him obscurely,
or enigmatically, or obscured it to him, or concealed
it from him, telling him, narrating to him, or
giving him an account of, a thing different from
that respecting which he was asked: but accord.
to As., لَاتَهُ, aor. يَلِيتُهُ, [not يَلُوتُهُ.] inf. n. لَيْتٌ,
signifies “ he expressed to him the news, or information, obscurely, or enigmatically, or obscured
it to him, or concealed it from him ”: thus he
makes it belong to art. ليت: and the like is said
in the L. See also above. (TA.) ―
-b4-  لَاتَهُ, aor.
يَلُوتُ; as also لَاتَهُ, aor. يَلِيتُ; He withheld
him, or restrained him, and turned him, or
averted him, from his course, purpose, or object.
(S, K, art ليت, q. v.)
اللَّاتُ: see اللَّاتُّ, in art. لت.
