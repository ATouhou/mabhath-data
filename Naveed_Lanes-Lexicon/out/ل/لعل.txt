لعللَعَلَّ [May-be; perhaps]; a word denoting
hope and fear. (K.) It governs the subject in
the accus. case, and the predicate in the nom.
See Ibn-'Akeel, ed. of Dieterici, p. 90; and see
لَيْتَ. ―
-b2-  لَعَلَّ, in its original and general acceptation, expresses hope; but in the word of God
it [often] expresses certainty, and may be rendered Verily. (Jel, ii. 19.)
