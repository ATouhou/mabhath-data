لبث1
لَبِثَ, aor.
لَبَثَ, inf. n. لَبْثٌ (which is contr. to
analogy, because the inf. n. of an intrans. v. of
the measure فَعِلَ is, accord. to rule, of the measure
فَعَلٌ, S,) and لَبَيثٌ (agreeably with analogy, occurring in a verse of Jereer, S,) and لَبَاثٌ (S, K)

contr. to analogy, is said in the TA, to be like
سحبان, but this I suppose to be a mistake for
سُبْحَان,] or لُبْثٌ and لَبَاثٌ are substs., (Msb,)
