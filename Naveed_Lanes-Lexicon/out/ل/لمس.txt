لَمَسَهُ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) aor.
لَمُسَ (S, M,
Msb, K) and
لَمِسَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. لَمْسٌ, (S,
M, Msb,) He felt it; or touched it; syn. مَسَّهُ:
(IAar, Az, IDrd, El-Fárábee, A, Msb, TA:)
or he felt it, or touched it, (مَسَّهُ,) with his hand:
(S, Msb, K:) or he put his hand to it: (Msb:)
or he felt it with his hand for the purpose of
testing it, that he might form a judgment of it;
syn. جَسَّهُ: (M, TA:) and ↓ لَامَسَهُ is syn. with
لَمَسَهُ, (M, TA,) or مَاسَّهُ: (A:) لَمْسٌ and مَسٌّ
both signify the perceiving by means of the exterior of the external skin: (Er-Rághib, TA:)
or they are nearly alike: (TA:) [generally, like
the English words feeling and touching, respectively:] or the former is, originally, [the
feeling] with the hand for the purpose of knowing
the feel (مَسّ) of a thing: (IDrd, Msb:) or,
with the hand, it is the seeking for [or feeling
for] a thing here and there: (Lth, TA:)
مُلَامَسَةٌ is the same as مُمَاسَّةٌ (K, TA) with the
hand; as also لَمْسٌ: (TA:) or a distinction is
to be made between them; for it is said that
لَمْسٌ is sometimes the feeling, or touching a
thing with a thing; and is sometimes [for] the
knowledge of a thing, though there be no touching (مَسّ) of substance upon substance; whereas
ملامسة is mostly mutual feeling or touching, &c.,
being] the act of two. (IAar in TA.) ―

↓ لَامَسَهَا, (M, A, Msb,) inf. n. مُلَامَسَةٌ (I'Ab, S,
Msb, K) and لِمَاسٌ: (I'Ab, Msb:) and (assumed tropical:)  he
kissed her; by doing which, as well as by the
former, one renders necessary the performance of
the ablution termed وضوء. ('Abd-Allah Ibn-
'Amr, Ibn-Mes'ood.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also,] لَمَسَهُ,

لَمُسَ [and
لَمِسَ], (A, TA,) inf. n. لَمْسٌ, (IDrd,
Msb, TA,) (tropical:)  He sought, [as though by feeling,]
or sought for or after, it, namely, a thing,
(IDrd, Msb, TA,) in any manner; (IDrd,

TA:) or this last signifies he sought it, or sought
for or after it, repeatedly, or time after time.
(S, K, TA.) You say, أُلْمُسْ لِى فُلَانًا (A, TA)
(tropical:)  Seek thou for me such a one. (TA.) And it
is said in the Kur, [lxxii. 8,] relating the words
of the jinn, or genii, إِنَّا لَمَسْنَا السَّمَآءَ, (K, * TA, *)
(tropical:)  Verily we sought to reach heaven: or to learn
the news thereof: (Bd:) or to hear by stealth
what was said therein: (Jel:) or we laboured, or
strove, after (عَالَجْنَا) the secrets of heaven, and
sought to hear them by stealth. (K.) And in a
trad., بِهِ عِلْمًا ↓ مَنْ سَلَكَ طَرِيقًا يَلْتَمِسُ (tropical:)  Whoso
pursueth a way whereby he seeketh after knowledge, or science. (TA.) And in another, of
'Áïsheh, عِقْدِى ↓ فَالْتَمَسْتُ (tropical:)  And I sought for
my necklace. (TA.) ―
-b4-  لَمَسَ البَصَرَ, aor.

took away the sight. (A, TA.) And the same,
or, accord. to one relation of a trad., ↓ التمسهُ, (assumed tropical:)  It
took away quickly, and destroyed, the sight; said
there of certain serpents: or the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  it
aimed at the eye with its bite: and لَمَسَ عَيْنَهُ is
said to signify [(assumed tropical:)  he, or it, put out his eye,] the
same as سَمَلَ. (TA.)

لامسهُ, inf. n. مُلَامَسَةٌ and لِمَاسٌ: for its
proper signification, see 1, in three places.
[Hence,] بَيْعُ المُلَامَسَةِ, (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb,)
and بَيْعُ اللِّمَاسِ, (Mgh,) or المُلَامَسَةُ فِى البَيْعِ,
(K,) A mode of bargaining, which consists in
saying, When thou feelest, or touchest, my garment, or I feel, or touch, thy garment, (A, K,)
or when, (Mgh,) or if, (Msb,) I feel, or touch,
thy garment, and thou feelest, or touchest, my
garment, (Mgh, Msb,) or when I feel, or touch,
the thing to be sold, (S,) the sale is binding, or
settled, or concluded, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) between us, (S, Msb,) for such a sum: (S, Msb,
K:) or, accord. to Aboo-Haneefeh, in thy saying, I will sell to thee this commodity for such a
sum, and when I feel, or touch, thee, the sale is
binding, or settled, or concluded; or in the purchaser's saying the like: (Mgh:) or, (M, Mgh,
K,) as in the Sunan of Aboo-Dáwood, (Mgh,)
in purchasing a commodity on the condition of
feeling it (M, Mgh, * K, *) behind a garment or
piece of cloth, (K,) without seeing it, (M, K,) or
spreading it out and turning it over and examining it: (Mgh:) or on the condition that the
feeling it with the hand shall cut one off from the
choice of returning it: (TA:) the mode of bargaining thus termed is forbidden. (S, M, A,
Mgh, Msb.) ―

verb, see 1.

تَلَمَّسَ see 1, in two places.

إِلْتَمَسَ see 1, in four places.
لَمُوسٌ A she-camel of whose fatness one doubts;
(O, TS, K;) on the authority of Ibn-'Abbád;
(TA;) i. q. شَكُوكٌ and ضَبُوثٌ: (A, TA:) or of
whose hump one doubts, whether there be in her
fat or not; wherefore it is felt: (M, L:) pl.
لُمُسٌ. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  One whose origin,
or lineage, is suspected; syn. دَعِىٌّ: (K:) or in
whose grounds of pretention to respect is a fault,
or taint. (A, K.)
لَمِيسٌ A woman soft to the feel, or touch;
لَيِّنَةُ المَلْمَسِ. (K.)
لَمَاسَةٌ, (M,) لُمَاسَةٌ, (S,) or both, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  A
want: (IAar, Sgh:) or a moderate, or middling,
want. (S, M, O, L.)
لَمُوسَةٌ A road, or way: so called because he
who has lost his way seeks it in order to find the
track of the travellers. (K, * TA.)
لَامِسٌ act. part. n. of 1. (Msb, &c.) One says,
of a woman who commits adultery, or fornication, or acts viciously, فَلَانَةُ لَا تَرُدُّ يَدَ لَامِسٍ,
(A, TA,) or لَا تَمْنَعُ يَدَ لَامِسٍ, (K,) but the
latter is at variance with the written authorities,
the former being the phrase commonly known,
(TA,) [properly signifying, Such a woman does
not repel the hand of a feeler;] meaning, (tropical:)  such
a woman commits adultery, or fornication, and
acts viciously, (K, TA,) not repelling from herself any one who desires of her that he may lie
with her; (TA;) and she is suspected of easiness,
or compliance, (K, TA,) towards him who desires
of her that he may lie with her: (TA:) or the
meaning is, such a woman gives, of her husband's
property, what is sought, or demanded, from
her; and this is more probably meant in a trad.
in which a man is related to have said thus of
his wife; because Mohammad directed him to
retain her, and did not require him to divorce
her. (TA.) The like said of a man, (K,)
فُلَانٌ لَا يَرُدُّ يَدَ لَامِسٍ, (A, Msb,) means, (tropical:)  Such a
man has in him no force of resistance, (A, Msb,
K,) nor care of what is sacred, or inviolable.
(TA.)
مَلْمَسٌ [A place that is felt, or touched: and it
may also be an inf. n.: see لَمِيسٌ]. (K.)
إِكَافٌ مَلْمُوسُ الأَحْنَآءِ (tropical:)  An ass's saddle, or pad,
of which the curved pieces of wood have been felt
with the hands until they have become even:
(M:) or of which any unevenness and prominence that was therein has been pared off (Lth,
T, A, K) by the passing of the hand over it,
(Lth, T,) or of the hands. (A.)
