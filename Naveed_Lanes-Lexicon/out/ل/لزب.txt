لَزْبٌ Strait; narrow; difficult. E. g. عَيْشٌ لَزْبٌ
A strait, or difficult life. (TA.)
لِزْبٌ A narrow road, or way. (K.)
لَزَبٌ immediately following عَزَبٌ, (in the CK,
غَرَبٌ,) [meaning a man “ who has no wife,”] is
an imitative sequent [used by way of pleonasm
and corroboration]. (K.) So likewise لَزَبَةٌ after
عَزَبَةٌ. (Ibn-Buzruj.)
لَزِبٌ Little in quantity or number: pl. لِزَابٌ.
(K.) E. g. مَاءٌ لَزِبٌ Little water. (TA.)
لَزْبَةٌ Adversity; difficulty; distress; (S, K;)
drought: (S:) pl. لِزَبٌ (IJ, K: in the CK لَزْبٌ)
and لَزْبَاتٌ: (S, K:) the latter with the ز quiescent, because it is [originally] an epithet. (S.)
E. g. أَصَابَتْهُمْ لَزْبَةٌ Distress and drought befell
them. (S.) ―
-b2-  سَنَةٌ لَزْبَةٌ A severe year; a year

-b3-  صَارَ الشَّىْءُ
ضَرْبَةَ لَازِبٍ The thing became fixed, settled, firm,
or constant, (S, K,) and severe: (TA:) [or,
a constant infliction:] or, indispensable, or necessary: i. e., the blow of a sword that sticks, or
remains fixed, [in the wound]. (Aboo-Bekr,
cited in the TA.) لازب is here the same as
لازم: (K:) the latter is the original word; the
م being changed into ب; and is also used in
this phrase: (TA:) but لازب, in this in-
stance, is the more chaste. (S.) En-Nábighah
says,
فَلَا تَحْسِبُونَ الخَيْرَ لَا شَرَّ بَعْدَهُ
وَلَا تَحْسِبُونَ الشَّرَّ ضَرْبَةَ لَازِبِ
[Then think ye not that good shall have no evil
after it, nor think ye that evil shall be a constant
infliction]. (S.) Sgh says, of the conversion of
رِوَاغَةٌ into رِيَاغَةٌ, or of و into ى because of kesreh
before it, هٰذَا القَلْبُ لَيْسَ بِضَرْبٍ لَازِبٍ [This conversion is not a necessary sort.] (TA in art.
روغ.)
مِلْزَابٌ Very avaricious; tenacious, or niggardly: (S, K:) pl. مَلَازِيبُ. (S.)
