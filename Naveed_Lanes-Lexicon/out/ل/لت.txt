اللَّاتُّ, occurring in the Kur [liii. 19,] (TA,)
so accord. to the reading of Ibn-'Abbás and
'Ikrimeh and some others, (K,) and so originally
accord. to Fr.: (TA:) afterwards contracted
into اللَّاتُ: (Fr, K:) which is the common
reading: (Fr:) A certain idol; thus called by
the appellation of a man who used to moisten
سَوِيق with clarified butter at the place thereof:
(K:) the man who did this was thus called, and
afterwards the idol itself. (TA.) Some of the
lexicologists say, that it was a mass of rock, at
the place whereof was a man who used to moisten
سويق for the pilgrims, and which, when he died,
was worshipped: (L:) but ISd says, I know
not what is the truth in this case. (TA.) In
the R it is said, that the man who used to do
this was 'Amr Ibn-Lu-eí; that when the tribe of
Khuzá'ah obtained the dominion over Mekkeh,
and banished the tribe of Jurhum, the Arabs
made him a Lord, or an object of worship; and
that he was El-Látt, who used to moisten سويق
for the pilgrims upon a well-known rock, called
صخْرَةُ اللَّاتِّ: or, it is said, that the man in
question was of the tribe of Thakeef; and that
when he died, 'Amr Ibn-Loheí (لحى: so in the
TA) said to the people, “He hath not died, but
hath entered the rock: ” and ordered them to
worship it, and built over it a house called اللات:
it is also said to have continued thus during the
life of this man and that of his son, for three
hundred years: then that rock was named اللَّاتُ,
without teshdeed to the ت, and was taken for an
idol, to be worshipped. (TA.) It is disputed
whether it were [an idol] of the tribe of Thakeef
at Et-Táïf, or of the tribe of Kureysh at En-Nakhleh. (MF.) Some say, that the ت is
originally without teshdeed, and to denote the
fem. gender: Ks used to pronounce the word in
a case of pause اللَّاهْ; and Aboo-Is-hák [Zj]
says, that this is agreeable with analogy; but
that the more approved mode is to pronounce it
in such case with ت. AM says, that the manner
in which Ks pronounced it in a case of pause
shows that he did not derive it from لَتٌّ. The
polytheists who worshipped this idol used to
compare its name with the name of اللّٰه. It is
also said, that اللَّاتُ, without teshdeed, is of the
measure فَعَلَةٌ [originally اللَّوَيَةُ] from the root
لوى; [and that the said idol was so called]
because they used to compass it, or perform
circuits round it. (TA.) [See art. لوى: and
see also arts. لوه and ليه: and الرَّبَّةُ, in art رب.]
