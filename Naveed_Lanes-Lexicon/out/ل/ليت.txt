ليت1
لَاتَهُ, aor. يَليِتُ, (inf. n. لَيْتٌ, S,) as also
لَاتَةُ, aor. يَلُوتُ; or لَاتَهُ عَنْ وَجْهِهِ; as also
↓ أَلَاتَهُ; (and أَلَتَهُ; S, K, art. أَلت;) He withheld him, or restrained him, and turned him, or
averted him, from his course, purpose, or object.
(S, K.) The Rájiz says,
وَلَيْلَةٍ ذَاتِ دُجًا سَرَيْتُ
وَلَمْ يَلِتْنِى عَنْ سُرَاهَا لَيْتُ
[During many a dark night (or many a rainy,
or wet, night, accord. to the reading in the TA,
namely ذات نَدًى) have I journeyed;] and no
hindrance hindered me from journeying during
it: (S:) or the meaning is ―
-b2-  and no averting
thing averted me, &c.; لَيْتُ being put for لَائِتُ:
or, nothing made me to repent, and say, لَيْتَنِى
مَا سَرَيْتُهَا Would that I had not journeyed during
it! or, no deficiency, nor any impotence, averted
me, &c., accord. to the T. (TA.) ―
-b3-  لَاتَهُ حَقَّهُ,
aor. يَلِيتُ, inf. n. لَيْتٌ; and ↓ أَلَاتَهُ; but the
former is the more approved; as also أَلَاتَهُ and
أَلِتهُ; He diminished unto him his due, or right:
[or defrauded him of part thereof.]. (TA.) It
is said in the Kur, [xlix. 14,] لَايَلِتْكُمْ مِنْ أَعْمَالِكُمْ
شَيْئًا He will not diminish unto you, nor defraud
you of, aught [of the reward] of your works.
(Fr, Zj.) ―
-b4-  مَا أَلَانَهُ شَيْئًا; as also مَا أَلَتَهُ (and
مَا أَلتَهُ; TA;) He did not diminish unto him
aught. (Fr, S, K.) In مَا أَلَتْنَاهُمْ مِنْ عَمَلِهِمْ مِنْ
شَىْءٍ, in the Kur, [lii. 21, q. v. in art. ألت.]
the verb may be from أَلَتَ or from أَلَاتَ. (TA.)
―
-b5-  الحَقَّ ↓ بِتُّ أُلِيتُ in a verse of 'Orweh Ibn-El-Ward, signifies أُحِيلُهُ and أُصْرِفُهُ [I passed the
night putting away (from my mind the thought
of) death: the poet having just before mentioned
the death of certain of his camels]. (Sh, L.) ―
-b6-
In the following saying, الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِى لَا يُفَاتُ
وَلَا يَلَاتُ وَلَا تَشْتَبِهُ عَلَيْهِ الأَصْوَاتُ [Praise be to God,
whom nothing will escape, (lit., who will not be
escaped, see Kur xxxiv. 50, and 1 in art. فوت,)
and —, and to whom voices will not be confused,
or undistinguishable, one from another!], لا يلات
is from أَلَاتَ, a dial. var. of لَاتَ, aor. يلِيتُ, in
the sense of نَقَصَ, and signifies unto whom one
cannot diminish [aught that is his due], and
whom prayer cannot be hindered from reaching:
so accord. to IAar: or, accord. to Khálid Ibn
Jembeh, upon whom nothing that any one
saith can have any power; (expl. by لا يأخد فيه
قول قائل;) i. e., who obeyeth no one. (L.) ―
-b7-
لَاتَ شَيْاً, aor. يَلِيتُ, He concealed a thing that
he knew, and told, or narrated, something different from it. (TA, art. لوث, q. v.) ―
-b8-  لَاتَهُ,
aor. يَلِيتُ, inf. n. لَيْتٌ, He expressed to him the
news, or information, obscurely, or enigmatically,
or obscured it to him, or concealed it from him:
so accord. to As, and the like is said in the L:
but accord. to some, the verb is لَاتَهُ, aor. يَلُوتُ,
q. v., in art. لوت. (TA, art. لوت) ―
-b9-  وَلَاتَ
حِينَ مَنَاصٍ, occurring in the Kur, [xxxviii. 2,]
(S,) [there meaning, accord. to the general
opinion, When (it, or the time,) was not a time
of flight: in other cases, and (it, or the time,) is,
or was, not a time of flight]. لات is here likened
to لَيْسَ; and the name of the agent is understood. (S, K.) So says Akh, accord. to J;
but this is the opinion of Sb: so in the margin of
some copies of the S. (TA.) Or لات is originally لا; and the ت is added, as in ثُمَّتَ [in the
CK, ثَمَّت,] (El-Muärrij, S, K,) and رُبَّتَ.
(El-Muärrij, S.) ―
-b10-  With respect to the proper
meaning and etymology of لات there are four
opinions. First, that it is a single word, a verb
in the pret. tense: and some say, that it is originally لَاتَ in the sense of نَقَصَ, and afterwards
used as a negative, like قَلَّ: so says Aboo-Dharr
El-Khushanee, in his Expos. of the Book of Sb:
others, that it is originally لَيِسَ; that its س is
changed into ت, and then the ى into ا, because
it is movent and preceded by fet-hah: so says
Abu-r-Rabeea. Second, that it is two words,
the negative لا, with the fem. ت, added to make
the word fem., as say IHsh and Er-Radee, or to
render the negation more intensive, as is said in
the Expos. of the Katr by the author of the latter
work: and this is the general opinion. Third,
that it is an independent word, not originally
ليس nor لا; as related by the sheykh Aboo-Is-
hák Esh-Shátibee alone. Fourth, that it is a
word and a part of a word, namely the negative
لا, and ت prefixed to حين; which opinion is
ascribed to A'Obeyd [as is mentioned in the S]
and Ibn-El-Taráweh: the former of whom
argues in favour of this opinion from the fact
that ت is found so prefixed in Othmán's copy of
the Kur-án; but this is no proof, because there
are found in the writing of that copy things at
variance with analogy. (TA.) تَحِينَ [however] occurs, without لات, in the following verse
of Aboo-Wejzeh:
العَاطِفُونَ تَحِينَ مَا مِنْ عَاطِفٍ
وَالمُطْعِمُونَ زَمَانَ أَيْنَ المُطْعِمُ
[The persons who act affectionately in the time
when there is none (other) that acts affectionately;
and the feeders in the time when (it is said)
Where is the feeder?] (S.) The general opinion
is favoured by the following facts: that لات is
pronounced in a case of pause لَاتْ and لَاهْ: that
it is written separately from حين: and that it is
sometimes written لَاتِ, with kesreh to the ت,
as is mentioned by Z, agreeably with the fundamental rule with respect to the concurrence of
two quiescent letters [when followed by a conjunctive ا]; whereas, were it a verb in the
pret. tense, there would be no reason for its being
written with kesreh: it is also written لَاتُ, with
dammeh to the ت: and both these variations
occur in readings of the Kur-án: but لَاتَ, with
fet-hah to the ت, is the most common. (TA.)
―
-b11-  With respect to its government there are
also four opinions. First, that it has no government: that if a noun in the nom. case follow it,
it is put in that case as an inchoative of which
[as is mentioned in the S] the enunciative is
suppressed; and that if a noun in the acc. case
follow it, it is put in that case as an objective
complement of a verb suppressed; which is the
opinion of Akh; the meaning of لات حين مناص
being, in the former case, لاحِينُ مَنَاصٍ كَائِنٌ لَهُمْ
[A place of flight not existing for them; which
does not imply that there was none for others;
as لا here has the force of a particular, not a
general, negation]; and in the latter case, the
meaning being, لَا أَرَى حِينَ مَنَاصٍ [I see not a
time of flight]. Second, that it governs in the
same manner as إِنَّ; which is another opinion
of Akh and the Koofees. Third, that it is a
particle governing the gen. case; an opinion
ascribed to Fr by Er-Radee and IHsh and
others. Fourth, that it governs like لَيْسَ; and
this is the general opinion; but IHsh restricts
it by two conditions; that the two nouns which
it governs must be significant of time, and that
one of them must be suppressed. (TA.) [It
is generally the subject, rarely the predicate, that
is suppressed.] ―
-b12-  لات [when it has grammatical
government] does not occur without حين [or,
as many say, some word syn. therewith, as وَقْت,
&c.]. (S, K.) So says Akh, accord. to J; but
this is the assertion of Sb; because the latter
holds it to have the same government as ليس;
whereas Akh assigns to it no government [as
explained above]. (IB.) But [it is said that]
حين is sometimes suppressed, (in poetry, S, [or
in prose,]) though meant to be understood; as
in the following saying of Mázin Ibn-Málik,
[respecting 'Abd-Shems, surnamed Makrooa, the
son of Saad the son of Zeyd-Menáh the son of
Temeem, and respecting Heyjumáneh the
daughter of El-'Ambar the son of 'Amr the son
of Temeem, (S, art. قرع,) who was enamoured
of Makrooa,] وَحَنَّتْ وَلَاتَ هَنَّتْ وَأَنَّى لَكِ مَقْرُوعٌ
[And she conceived a longing desire; but it was
not a time for her conceiving such a desire. And
how (O Heyjumáneh) should Makrooa be thine?
See Freytag, Arab. Prov. i. 343 and ii. 525.]
(S, K.) This, however, is said to be not poetry
but a prose-example. (TA.) Moreover, it is
observed, that لات, in this instance, has no
government, and that a word signifying time is
not meant to be understood after it: [so that the
meaning is, And she conceived a longing desire,
but it was as though she did not conceive such a
desire:] (MF.) for when لات has government,
the subject and predicate cannot both be suppressed. (AHei, MF.)

أَلْيَتَ see 1.
لَيْتَ a word denoting a wish [signifying
Would that —; I wish that —;] (S, K;)
generally relating to a thing that is impossible;
rarely to a thing that is possible: (IHsh, K:)
governing the subject in the acc. case, and the
predicate in the nom. case, (S, K,) like كَأَنَّ (or
[rather] إِنَّ, MF) and its coordinates, because
it resembles verbs in their force as words, [being
composed of at least three letters, and the last
being meftoohah,] and in their admitting most
of the pronouns as affixes, and in their meanings.
(S.) Ex. لَيْتَ زَيْدًا ذَاهِبٌ [Would that Zeyd
were going;] (S;) and لَيْتَنِى فَعَلْتُ كَذَا وَكَذَا
[Would that I had done so and so.] (TA.)
You say لَيْتِى as well as لَيْتَنِى, (S, K,) like
لَعَلِّى and لَعَلَّنِى, and إِنِّى and إِنَّنِى: (S:) but
ليتنى is more common than ليتى; whereas
لعلّنى is less common than لعلّى. (TA.) You
also say يَا لَيْتَ O, would that —;.] As to the
saying of the poet,
يَا لَيْتَ أَيَّامَ الصِّبَا رَوَاجِعَا
meaning لَنَا رَوَاجِعَ, [O, would that the days of
youth were returning (to us)!] رواجع is put in the
acc. case therein as a word descriptive of state:
(S:) or it is governed in the acc. case by a verb
understood, as أَقْبَلَتْ, or عَادَتْ, or some other
verb suitable to the meaning: so says Sb:
(TA:) or ليت in the above verse may be used
in the manner of وَجَدْتُ, [see below], (S,) for
ليت is sometimes used in the manner of وَجَدْتُ
[I found], (Fr, S, K,) in government, not in
meaning, (MF,) as related by the grammarians
on the authority of certain of the Arabs, so that
it is doubly transitive, and used in the manner
of verbs: (S:) you say, لَيْتَ زَيْدًا شَاخِصًا [Would
that Zeyd were going away, &c.]: (S, K:)
this is done to give intensiveness: one says, for
this purpose, لَيْتَ زَيْدًا قَائِمًا (Would that Zeyd
were standing) putting both the subject and the
predicate in the acc. case. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  لَيْتَمَا:
see De Sacy's Gr. Ar. ii. 63. ―
-b3-  See also an ex.
of ليت as a subst. voce سَوْفَ.
لِيتٌ The side of the neck: (S, K:) or the ليتَانِ
are the lower parts of the two sides of the neck,
upon which the earrings hang down, behind the
two projections of the jaw-bones that are beneath
the ear: or the parts of the neck beneath the
earrings: or the places upon which the cuppinginstrument is applied; المَحْجَمَتَانِ: pl. أَلْيَاتٌ
and ليتة [but whether the latter be لِيتَةٌ or لِيَتَةٌ is
not shown]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  أَصْغَى لِيتًا He inclined
the side of his neck. (TA, from a trad.)
