-b3-  اِمْرَأَةٌ سَرِيعَةُ اللَّقَحِ A
woman quick in conceiving, or becoming pregnant.
The like is said with respect to any female.
Perhaps the word thus used has this signification
properly, or perhaps tropically. (TA.) ―
-b4-  أَسَرَّتْ
لَقَحًا, and لَقَاحًا, She (a camel) concealed her
having conceived, or become pregnant: i. e., she
did not show signs of her having conceived by

لَقِحَتِ النَّخِيلُ, or لُقِحَت, (as in different copies
of the S,) (tropical:)  [The palm-trees became fecundated
by the process termed إِلْقَاحٌ: see 4]: and of a
single palm-tree (نَخْلَةٌ) you say لَقِحَتْ, or
لُقِحَتْ, without teshdeed; (so, again, in different

القح الفَحْلُ النَّاقَةَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. إِلْقَاحٌ;
(Msb;) and ↓ لقّحها, (A,) [inf. n. تَلْقِيحٌ;] The
stallion-camel made the she-camel to conceive, or
become pregnant; impregnated her; got her with
young. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  القح النَّخْلَةَ, inf. n. إِلْقَاحٌ,
[and quasi-inf. n. لَقَاحٌ, q. v.; et vide infra;] and
↓ لقّحها, inf. n. تَلْقِيحٌ; (S, Msb, A, K;) and
↓ لَقَحَهَا, inf. n. لَقْحٌ; (K;) (tropical:)  He fecundated the
palm-tree by means of the ↓ لَقَاح, or spadix of
the male tree, which is bruised, or brayed, and
sprinkled [upon the spadix of the female]: (A:)
or, by inserting a stalk of a raceme of the male
tree into the spathe [of the female, after shaking
off the pollen of the former upon the spadix of the
female; for such is the general practice]: this is
done in the following manner: you leave the
spathe of the [female] palm-tree two or three
nights after its bursting open: then you take a
stalk of a raceme of the male tree, which is best
if old, of the preceding year, and insert it into
the spadix [of the female, after shaking off the
pollen, as above mentioned]; and this you do
according to a certain measure: it should not be
done but by a man acquainted with the manner
of proceeding in this case; for if he be ignorant,
and do too much, he turns the spathe, and mars
it; and if he do too little, many of the dates produced will be without stones; and if he do it not
at all to the palm-tree, he will derive no advantage from the spadix thereof that year: (L:)
↓ لَقَحٌ is the name of that which is taken from the
male palm-tree (الفُحَّال: so in the L: in the K,
الفَحْل:) to be inserted in the other, [namely the
spathe of the female]. (L, K.) [See also لَقَاحٌ.
In the CK, for إِسْمُ مَا أُخِذَ الخ, we find اسم ماءٍ
اخذ الخ, giving a different and false meaning.]
جَآءَنَا زَمَنُ اللَّقَاحِ, or ↓ التَّلْقِيحِ, The time of the
fecundating of the palm-trees has come to us.

لَقَحٌ: inf. n. of 1. q. v. ―
-b2-  see أَلْقَحَ النَّخْلَةَ, and
see لَقَاحٌ.

لِقَاحٌ The semen genitale (L, K) of a stallion
camel, and horse, and (tropical:)  of a man. (L.) I'Ab,
being asked respecting a man who had two
wives, one of whom suckled a boy, and the other
a girl, [not his own children,] whether the boy
might marry the girl, answered “ No; because
the لقاح [i. e., لِقَاح or ↓ لَقَاح, as shown below,] is
one: ” meaning, says Lth, that the semen
genitale which impregnated them both, and
which was the source of the milk of both, was
one, and that the two sucklings had thus become
as though they were the children of the two
women's husband: but, says Az, لقاح may here
be a quasi-inf. n., syn. with إِلْقَاحٌ; like عَطَآءٌ and
إِعْطَآءٌ &c.: (L:) [and the like is said in the Msb.]
↓ لَقَاحٌ and لِقَاحٌ, with fet-h and kesr, are substs.
from أَلْقَحَ, [q. v.] syn. with إِلْقَاحٌ, signifying
impregnation, or the getting with young; and
so in the answer of I'Ab above mentioned.
(Msb.)
لَقُوحٌ A camel (S, K) itself: (S:) pl. لِقَاحٌ.
(S, K.) ―
-b2-  See لَاقِحٌ. ―
-b3-  لَقُوحٌ and ↓ لِقْحَةٌ (S,
Msb, K) and ↓ لَقْحَةٌ, (Msb, K,) applied to a
she-camel, i. q. حَلُوبٌ [meaning Milch, and a
milch camel]: (S, Msb, K:) but Az says, that
the former only is used as an epithet; you say
ناقة لَقُوحٌ, and not ناقةٌ لِقْحَةٌ, but هٰذِهِ لِقْحَةٌ فُلَانٍ:
(TA:) or لَقُوحٌ is [an epithet] applied to a she-camel during the first two or three months after
her having brought forth; and after this she is
termed لَبُونٌ: (AA, S, K:) and accord. to some,
↓ لِقْحَةٌ signifies a milch camel abounding with
milk: or a she-camel from the time when the
hump of her young one becomes fat, until the
expiration of seven months, when she weans her
young one, and this she does at the [auroral]
rising of Canopus: (TA:) [which rising, in
central Arabia, about the commencement of the
era of the Flight was between the 30th of July
and the 12th of August:] also ↓ لِقْحَةٌ and
↓ لَقْحَةٌ a she-camel that has lately brought forth:
(L:) pl. of لَقُوحٌ, لِقَاحٌ (S, Msb, K) and لَقَائِحُ;
(ISh;) and pl. of ↓ لِقْحَةٌ (and of ↓ لَقْحَةٌ, K,
TA,) لِقَحٌ (S, Msb, K) and لِقَاحٌ. (ISh, Th,
Msb.) ―
-b4-  The Arabs also said لِقَاحَانِ أَسْوَدَانِ
[Two black herds of milch camels], like as they
said قَطِيعَانِ; for they said لِقَاحٌ وَاحِدَةٌ in like
manner as they said قَطِيعٌ وَاحِدٌ and إِبِلٌ وَاحِدَةٌ.
(S.) ―
-b5-  المُسْلِمِينَ ↓ أَدِرُّوا لِقْحَةَ (tropical:)  Milk ye the
milch camel of the Muslims: occurring in a trad.,
alluding to the tribute (فَىْء and خَرَاج) whence
were derived the stipends and fixed appointments
of the persons addressed, and to the collecting it
with equity. (TA.)
لَقَّاحٌ A fecundator of palm-trees. (Az, TA in
art. جنى.)
لاقِحٌ (IAar, S, K) and ↓ لَقُوحٌ (K) and
↓ مَلْقُوحَةٌ (Msb) A she-camel having just conceived, or become pregnant; (IAar, K;) as also
قَارِحٌ: afterwards, when her pregnancy has
become manifestly apparent, she is termed خَلِفَةٌ:
(IAar:) pl. of the former لَوَاقِحُ (K) and لُقَّحٌ;
(TA;) and of the second, لُقُحٌ. (L, K, TA: in
the CK لُقَّحٌ.) ―
-b2-  رِيَاحٌ لَوَاقِحُ (S, K, &c.,)
(tropical:)  Pregnant winds; so called because they bear the
water and the clouds, and turn the latter over
and about, and then cause them to send down
rain; (TA;) or because they become pregnant,
and then impregnate the clouds: (IJ:) the sing. is
رِيحٌ لَاقِحٌ, the contr. of which is termed رِيحٌ
عَقِيمٌ [or “ a barren wind ”]: (ISd:) or ريح
لاقح signifies ذَاتُ لَقَلَاحٍ [possessing that which
impregnates]; like as دِرْهَمٌ وَازِنٌ signifies ذُو وَزْنِ;
رَجُلٌ رَامِحٌ, ذُو رُمْحٍ: (AHeyth:) or رياح لواقح
signifies impregnating, or fecundating, winds;
(S, K;) as also ↓ مَلَاقِحُ [pl. of مُلْقِحَةٌ]: (K:)
or it is not allowable to say مَلَاقِحُ; (S;) but
this is the regular form of the word; because the
wind impregnates the clouds; (IJ;) and thus
لواقح is extr.: or, as some say, the proper
original word is مُلْقِحَةٌ; but the winds do not
impregnate unless they are themselves pregnant;
as though they were pregnant with good,
and, when they raised the clouds, transmitted to them that good. (S.) ―
-b3-  حَرْبٌ لَاقِحٌ
(K) (tropical:)  War pregnant [with great events.] (TA.)
مُلْقِحٌ A stallion camel: pl. مَلَاقِحُ. (S, K.)
―

-b3-  (tropical:)  A man to whom offspring is
born. Occurring in a trad. (TA.)
مُلْقَحَةٌ A female camel that has her young one
in her belly: pl. مَلَاقِحُ: (S, K:) a pass. part. n.
from أَلْقَحَ. (Msb.)
مَلْقُوحَةٌ (IAar, S, K, &c.) and مَلْقُوحٌ, (IAar,)
which latter is also used in a pl. sense, (As,)
What is in the belly of a she-camel: (A 'Obeyd,
T, S, K, &c.:) or what is in the back of the
stallion camel; [meaning his progeny in the
elemental state;] (Aboo-Sa'eed, K;) but the
former, says Az, is the correct signification:
(L:) مَلْقُوحَةٌ is for مَلْقُوحٌ بِهِ, converted into a
subst., (Msb,) from لُقِحَتْ, like مَحْمُومٌ from حُمَّ,
and مَجْنُونٌ from جُنَّ: (S:) pl. مَلَاقِيحُ.
(A 'Obeyd, S, K, &c.) The Muslims are forbidden to sell مَلَاقِيح and مَضَامِين. (L.) [See
the latter of these words.] ―
-b2-  المَلَاقِيحُ is also
used (sometimes, TA) to signify The mothers:
and its sing. is مَلْقُوحَةٌ. (K.) ―
-b3-  See لَاقِحٌ.
