لوزلَوْزٌ [The almond; or almonds;] the fruit of
a certain tree; (Msb, TA;) well known; (A,
Msb, K;) abundant in the countries of the
Arabs; said by some to be a species of مِزْج,
which is that whereof the edible part is not
attained save by breaking; by others said to
be bruised, or brayed, مِزْج; and also called
قُمْرُوصٌ: it is of two kinds, sweet and bitter:

beneficial to the chest and the lungs and the bladder, (by reason of its soft nature, TA,) and the

clears away [the spots in the skin called] نَمَش,
and stills pain, (K [but omitted in the CK] and

when dropped into the ear; (TA;) and it relaxes
the bowels, and causes sleep, (K, TA,) when the
soles of the feet are anointed with it, and when it
is introduced into the nose; (TA;) and it is
diuretic: (K, TA:) it is an Arabic word: (Msb,
