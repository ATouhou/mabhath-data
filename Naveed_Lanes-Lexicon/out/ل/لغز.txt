-b2-  الغز كَلَامَهُ, (A,
K,) and الغز فِى كَلَامِهِ, (S, A, Msb, K,) signify
alike: (K:) or the former, (tropical:)  He made his speech,
or language, enigmatical, or obscure; not plain:
(A:) and the latter, (S, A,) or both, (K,) he
made his meaning enigmatical, or obscure, in his
speech, or language; (S, A, K;) as also ↓ لغّز:
(A:) or the second, he used parabolical language:
(Msb:) or both, he concealed a meaning different
from that which he made apparent: or he was
equivocal, or ambiguous, in his speech, or language,
for the purpose of concealment: as in the following verse, cited by Fr:
وَلَمَّا رَأَيْتُ النَّسْرَ عَزَّ أَبْنَ دَأُيَةَ
وَعَشَّشَ فِى وَكْرَيْهِ جَاشَتْ لَهُ نَفْسِى
(tropical:)  [And when I saw that the vulture had overcome the raven, and nested in his nest, (lit., in his
two nests,) my soul, or stomach, heaved thereat]:
the poet likens hoariness to the vulture, because
of its whiteness [or grayness]; and youthfulness
to the black raven, because the hair of youth
is black. (TA.) You say also, الغز فِى يَمِينِهِ
(tropical:)  He practised [equivocation, or ambiguity, (see
لُغَّيْزَى,) or] concealment, [by a mental reservation,
or otherwise,] towards the person sworn to, in his
oath: the doing of which is forbidden. (A.)
لَغْزٌ: see لُغَزٌ, throughout.
لُغَزٌ: see لُغَزٌ, throughout.
لَغَزٌ: see لُغَزٌ, throughout.
لُغَزٌ (S, A, K) and ↓ لُغْزٌ and ↓ لَغْزٌ (K) and ↓ لَغَزٌ
and ↓ لُغَيْزَآءُ (TA) A winding, or tortuous, excavation or burrow: this is the primary signification: (IAar, in explanation of لُغْزٌ:) the
burrow of a jerboa, which he makes between the
قَاصِعَآء and نَافِقَآء, burrowing strait downwards,
and then turning crosswise to the right and left,
so that his place becomes concealed: (S, K, *
TA:) or the burrow of the [lizard called] ضَبّ,
and of the jerboa, (A, K,) and of the rat or
mouse: (K:) pl. [of the first four] أَلْغَازٌ. (S, A.)
―
-b2-  Hence, (K,) أَلْغَازٌ (tropical:)  Winding, or tortuous,
roads, or ways, perplexing to him who pursues
them. (A, * K.) You say, إِلْزَمِ الجَادَّةَ وَإِيَّاكَ
وَالأَلْغَازَ (tropical:)  [Keep thou to the main road, and avoid
the winding, or tortuous, by-ways, which perplex
him who pursues them]. (A, TA.) ―
-b3-  Hence
also, (S,) لُغَزٌ (S, A, Sgh, Msb, K [omitted in
the copies of the K consulted by the author of
the TA, through inadvertence, as he observes,
but mentioned in the CK,]) and ↓ لُغْزٌ [which is
now the most common form] and ↓ لُغُزٌ and ↓ لَغَزٌ
(Sgh, K) and ↓ لُغَّيْزَى, (S, K,) with teshdeed to
the غ, and not a dim., because the ى of the
dim. does not occupy a fourth place, but like
خُضَّارَى and شُقَّارَى, (S,) and ↓ لُغَيْزَآءُ, (Az, K,)
like حُمَيْرَآءُ, (K,) [and app. ↓ لُغَّيْزَآءُ also, with
teshdeed, (see what follows,)] and ↓ أُلْغُوزَةٌ, (K,)
(tropical:)  An enigma; a riddle; enigmatical, or obscure,
language: (S, A, K:) or parabolical language:
(Msb:) pl. (of the first four, K, TA) أَلْغَازٌ.
(S, A, Msb, K.) And in like manner, يَمِينٌ
↓ لُغَّيْزَآءُ, accord. to Z, with teshdeed to the غ
mentioned by Sb with خُلَّيْطَآءُ, or, accord. to Az,
without teshdeed, [لُغَيْزَآءُ,] which he regards as
the dim. of the form with teshdeed, like as
سُكَيْتٌ is of سُكَّيْتٌ, (tropical:)  An oath in which is equivocation, or ambiguity, and concealment [by mental
reservation or otherwise]. (TA.)
لُغُزٌ: see لُغَزٌ.
لَغَّازٌ (tropical:)  One who often, or habitually, speaks evil
of others in their absence; (K, TA;) as though
he did so in equivocal or ambiguous language.
(TA.)

لُغَّيْزَى and لُغَّيْزَآءُ: see لُغَزٌ; the second in two
places.
