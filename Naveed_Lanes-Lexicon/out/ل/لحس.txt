مَلْحَسٌ is a noun of place; [signifying A
place of licking; &c;] as well as an inf. n.: and
in both cases it has مَلَاحِسُ for pl. (IJ.) You
say, تَرَكْتُهُ بِمَلَا حِسِ البَقَرِ, (S, A, K,) or بِمَلَاحِسِ
البَقَرِ أَوْلَادَهَا, (TA,) meaning, (tropical:)  I left him in the
places where the wild cows lick their young ones
(S, ISd, A, K) from the membranes in which
they are born: (ISd, TA:) or in a desert place,
(S,) or in a desert, or waterless desert, (ISd, A,
TA,) so that it was not known where he was;
(S;) because the wild cows bring forth only in
the deserts: (ISd, TA:) the former is like the
saying بِمَبَاحِثِ البَقَرِ; (S;) and is that which
ISd holds to be the right: (TA:) in the latter,
ملاحس is an inf. n., in the pl. form, which is
strange; because it governs اولاد in the accus.
case; and a prefixed noun [مَوَاضِع] is understood
before it: (IJ:) some relate the saying differently, thus, بِمَلْحَسِ البَقَرِ أَوْلَادَهَا, meaning,
بِمَوْضِعِ مَلْحَسِ البَقَرِ أَوْلَادَهَا [in the place of the
cows' licking their young ones]; (K;) because
[some hold that] an inf. n. of the measure مَفْعَلٌ
has no pl. (TA.)
مُلْحِسٌ: see مِلْحَسٌ.
مِلْحَسٌ (tropical:)  Greedy; as also ↓ لَحْوَس (K) and
↓ لَاحُوسٌ and ↓ مُلْحِسٌ: (TA:) and one who takes
everything that he can. (K:) or a greedy man,
who takes everything that he can: (A:) one who
takes everything that appears to him: (TA:)
[originally, a lick-dish:] and [in like manner]
↓ لَحُوسٌ (tropical:)  a man who seeks after sweets, like the
fly. (A, K.) ―
-b2-  Also, (assumed tropical:)  Courageous: (K:) as
though an eater of everything that rose up to
him. (TA.)
