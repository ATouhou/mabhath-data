لنلَنْ A particle denoting negation, rendering the
aor. mansoob, and restricting it to the future
sense: not implying corroboration of the negation, nor its never-ending continuance; though
Z asserts it to imply these. (K.) [Hence لَنْ
يَضْرِبَ signifies simply He will not beat: not
he assuredly will not beat; nor he will never
beat.]
