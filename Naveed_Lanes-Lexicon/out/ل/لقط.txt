لقط1
لَقَطَهُ, (S, Mgh, * Msb, K,) aor.
لَقُطَ, inf. n.
لَقْطٌ, (Msb, TA,) He picked it up, took it up,
raised it, (Mgh,) or took it, (S, K,) from the
ground, (S, Mgh, K,) without trouble or fatigue;
as also ↓ التقطهُ: (S:) or both signify he took it
from a place where it was not thought to be;
this being the primary signification: and hence,
he took it. (Msb.) It is said of a man: and
you say also, لَقَطَ الطَّائِرُ الحَبَّ [The bird picked
up from the ground the grains]. (Msb.) The
Arabs say to a calumniator, ↓ إِنَّ عِنْدَكَ دِيكًا يَلْتَقِطُ
الحَصَى [Verily thou hast a cock that picks up
pebbles]. (TA.) And it is said in a proverb,
أَصَيْدَ القُنْفُذِ أَمْ لَقْطَهُ [Is it by the hunting of
the hedgehog or the picking up thereof from the
ground?] applied to a poor man who becomes
rich suddenly. (TA.) [In Freytag's Arab.
Prov. (i. 726,) أَصَيْدُ القُنْفُذِ أَمْ لُقَطَةٌ: and there
asserted to be said of him who finds a thing
which he had not sought: or, accord. to Sharafed-Deen, of a thing of the nature of which we
may be uncertain.] You say also, لَقَطْتُ العِلْمِ
مِنَ الكُتُبِ (assumed tropical:)  [I picked up science, or knowledge,
from books;] I acquired science, or knowledge,
from this and that book. (Msb.) And لَقَطْتُ
أَصَابِعَهُ (assumed tropical:)  I took off his fingers, by cutting,
without [the main part of] the hand. (Msb.)

مُلَاقَطَةٌ A horse's lifting the legs all together
in the pace called تَقْرِيب: (AO, K: *) or, in the
pace called خَبَب, of a horse, it is similar to
مُنَاقَلَةٌ. (JK.)
-A2-  Also, (K,) and ↓ لِقَاطٌ, (TA,)
The being over against, or facing. (K, TA.)
You say, دَارُهُ بِلِقَاطِ دَارِى His house is over
against, or faces, my house. (Lh, K.) And
لَقِيتُهُ لِقَاطاً I met him face to face. (IAar.)

تلقّط فُلَانٌ التَّمْرَ, or الثَّمَرَ, (S, accord. to
different copies, and K, *) Such a one, [picked up,
or] took up from the ground, from this and that
place, the dates, or the fruits. (S, K. *)
8
التقطهُ: see 1, in two places. ―
-b2-  Also, He
collected it. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  And (tropical:)  He stumbled upon
it, or lighted on it, (K, TA,) unexpectedly, (TA,)
without seeking; (K, TA;) such a thing, for
instance, as a well, and herbage. (TA.) You
say also, وَرَدْتُ الشَّىْءَ الْتِقَاطًا (tropical:)  I came upon the
thing unexpectedly, or unawares; (S, TA:) and
لَقِيتُهُ الْتِقَاطًا (tropical:)  I met him unexpectedly: (TA:)
التقاطا in this sense being one of those inf. ns.
which are used as denotatives of state.
(Sb, TA.)
لَقَطٌ What is picked up, or taken from the
ground, (S, Msb, K,) of a thing; (S, Msb;)
as also ↓ لُقْطَةٌ and ↓ لُقَطَةٌ and ↓ لُقَاطَةٌ: (K:)
or ↓ this last signifies what one picks up, of lost
property; as also ↓ لُقَاطٌ, with the ة elided; and
↓ لُقَطَةٌ like رُطَبَةٌ: (Msb:) or ↓ لُقَاطَةٌ signifies
also what falls, or drops, of a thing that is
worthless, (K, TA,) or paltry, and is taken by
any one who chooses to take it: (TA:) and the
same, what is picked up from the stumps of the
branches of palm-trees, [app. meaning dates
picked up thence,] after the cutting off of the
dates: (TA:) IAth says, that ↓ لُقَطَةٌ, with
damm to the ل and fet-h to the ق, is often
mentioned in trads., and signifies property which
is found: (TA:) Az says, that لُقَطَةٌ, with fet-h
to the ق, signifies a thing which one finds
dropped, or thrown down, and takes; (Mgh,
Msb;) and that all the lexicologists and skilful grammarians say so; (Msb;) and in like
manner, A 'Obeyd, on the authority of As and of
El-Ahmar; (TA;) only Lth, of all whom he
has heard, saying that it is ↓ لُقْطَةٌ, with sukoon;
(Mgh, Msb;) and Fr: (TA:) IF and ElFárábee and others mention only ↓ لُقَطَةٌ; and
some reckon the pronunciation with sukoon as
an error of the vulgar; and the reason is this;
that the original word is ↓ لُقَاطَةٌ, which, in
consequence of its being in frequent use, as
applied to what is picked up in plundering, is
contracted, sometimes, by the elision of the ة,
into ↓ لُقَاطٌ, and sometimes, by the elision of the
ا into ↓ لُقَطَةٌ; and if they made the ق quiescent,
there would be two alterations in the word, and
such double alteration does not exist in chaste
language: (Msb:) IB, however, says that
↓ لُقْطَةٌ is correct; and he approves it; because
فُعْلَةٌ has the sense of a pass. part. n., as in the
instance of ضُحْكَةٌ; and فُعَلَةٌ has the sense of an
act. part. n., as in the instance of ضُحَكَةٌ; and
that it occurs in poetry: and IAth observes,
that some say thus; but that ↓ لُقَطَةٌ is more
common and more correct. (TA.) Anything
that is scattered, of ears of corn, or of fruit;
n. un. with ة: (TA:) what is picked up, or
taken from the ground, (S, Msb, K,) by men,
(S,) of ears of corn; (S, Msb, K;) as also
↓ لُقَاطٌ, with damm: (S:) and ↓ لَقَاطٌ, like سَحَابٌ,
the ears of corn which the reaping-hooks miss,
(AHn, K,) and which men pick up. (AHn.)
What is picked up from a mine: (Msb:) pieces
of gold found in a mine; (K;) or such are
termed لَقَطُ مَعْدِنٍ: (S:) or لَقَطٌ signifies pieces
of gold, or of silver, like what are termed شَذْر,
and larger, in mines; which are the best thereof:
and one says ذَهَبٌ لَقَطٌ: (Lth:) and ↓ مُلْتَقَطٌ,
also, signifies gold found in a mine. (TA.)
You say also, فِى هٰذَا المَكَانِ لَقَطٌ مِنَ المَرْتَعِ
In this place is some small quantity of pasturage.
(S.) And فِى الأَرْضِ لَقَطٌ لِلْمَالِ In the land is
pasturage not much in quantity for the beasts.
(TA.) The pl. is أَلْقَاطٌ. (TA.)
لُقْطَةٌ: see لَقَطٌ, throughout the first sentence.
―
-b2-  Accord. to Lth, it [also] signifies A man who
repeatedly and perseveringly seeks after things
to be picked up, and picks them up: (TA:) and
some say, that ↓ لُقَطَةٌ signifies one who picks up:
but the more common and correct signification
of this latter is “ property which is found,” as
before stated. (IAth.)
لُقَطَةٌ: see لَقَطٌ, throughout the first sentence: —
and see لُقْطَةٌ.
لَقَاطٌ: see لَقَطٌ, in the latter part of the paragraph.
لُقَاطٌ: see لَقَطٌ, in three places.
لِقَاطٌ: see 3. ―
-b2-  [The act of picking up the
ears of corn which the reaping-hooks miss;] the
act denoted in the explanation of لَقَاطٌ. (JK, K,
TA.) You say, هُوَ يَتَعَيَّشُ بِالِلّقَاطِ عَنِ اللَّقَاطِ
[He constrains himself to obtain the means of
life, or he obtains what is barely sufficient for
his sustenance, by picking up, or gleaning, from
the ears of corn which the reaping-hooks
have missed]. (TK: but there given without
any syll. signs.) [If the reading intended be
بِاللَّقَاطِ عَنِ اللِّقَاطِ, the meaning of لِقَاطٌ is The
act of missing ears of corn with the reapinghook; as is implied in the K, where لَقَاطٌ is
imperfectly explained: but this I think improbable.] لَقَاطٌ and لِقَاطٌ are [respectively] like
حَصَادٌ [as signifying what is “ reaped ”] and حِصَادٌ
[as signifying the act of “ reaping ”]. (TA.)
لَقِيطٌ i. q. ↓ مَلْقُوطٌ; (Msb, K;) i. e. A thing
that is picked up, taken up, raised, (Mgh,) or
taken, (Msb, K,) from the ground, (Mgh, K,)
or from a place where it was not thought to be.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  And, generally, (Mgh,) A foundling;
or child that is cast out, (Az, S, Mgh, Msb, K,)
and found by a man, (Az, TA,) or picked up;
(S;) or because it is cast out with the object of
its being picked up: (Mgh:) not what Lth
asserts it to be; i. e. a child that is cast out in
the roads, and there found, whose father and
mother are unknown: of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the
sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: (Az, TA:) and
↓ مَلْقُوطٌ signifies the same: (K:) [pl. of the
former, لُقَطَآءُ.] ―
-b3-  Also, A well upon which one
lights unexpectedly, or unawares, (Lth, K,) without seeking it. (Lth.)
لُقَاطَةٌ: see لَقَطٌ, first sentence, in four places.
لَقِيطَةٌ applied to a man, and to a woman,
(tropical:)  Low, ignoble, base, vile, or mean; (K, TA;)
as also ↓ لَاقِطَةٌ applied to a man; (TA;) and
so ↓ سَاقِطٌ مَاقِطٌ لَاقِطٌ, used together. (L in art.
سقط.) It occurs in this sense preceded by
سَقِيطَةٌ; but you say سَقِيطٌ when alone. (TA.)
لَقَّاطٌ: see لَاقِطٌ.
لَقَّاطَةٌ: see لَاقِطٌ.
لَاقِطٌ and in an intensive sense ↓ لَقَّاطٌ and [in a
doubly intensive sense] ↓ لَقَّاطَةٌ A man [who
picks up things from the ground; and the second,
who does so much, or often; and the third, who
does so very much, or very often: or] who takes
things from places where they were not thought to
be: (Msb:) and all signify a man who picks up
the ears of corn [that fall] when the crop is
reaped, and [the fruit that falls] when the ripe
dates are cut from the raceme: (TA:) and the
first and second, a bird that picks up grains.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  ↓ لِكُلِّ سَاقِطَةٍ لَاقِطَةٌ For every saying
that falls from one, there is a person who will
take it up: (Msb in art. سقط:) or for every
word that falls from the mouth of the speaker,
there is a person who will hear it and pick it up
and publish it: (S, * K:) a proverb, (TA,)
relating to the guarding of the tongue: (K:)
the ة in لاقطة is to give intensiveness to the
meaning, (Msb, in art. سقط,) or for the purpose
of assimilation: (Msb in that art., and in the
present one:) if you say لِكُلِّ ضَائِعٍ, or the like,
you say لَاقِطٌ. (Msb in the present art.) ―
-b3-
الحَصَى ↓ لَاقِطَةٌ The قَانِصَة [meaning stomach,
&c.,] of a bird, (S, K,) in which pebbles become
collected: (S:) or the omasum (قِبّة) of a sheep
or goat [and the corresponding ventricle of a
camel, as is shown in the TA in art. حصل; also
called لَقَّاطَةُ الحَصَى (see قُرَيْحَآءُ);] because it
conveys thereinto whatever it eats of earth and
pebbles; (A, TA;) as also اللَّاقِطَةٌ [alone].
(TA.)
-A2-  لَاقِطٌ also signifies (tropical:)  Any freedman, or
emancipated slave: (K:) or the slave of a freedman. (S in art. مقط, and TA in art. سقط:) the
slave of the لاقط is called مَاقِطٌ; and the slave
of the ماقط is called سَاقِطٌ: and hence the
saying, هُوَ سَاقِطُ بْنُ مَاقِطِ بْنِ لَاقِطٍ. (K, TA [but
in the CK, for هُوَ we find بَنُو, with the necessary
difference in what follows it.]) See art. سقط.
―
-b2-  See also لَقِيطَةٌ: and see أَلْقَاطٌ, which may be
a pl. of لَاقِطٌ; as in لُقَّاطٌ, which is explained with
أَلْقَاطٌ.
لَاقِطَةٌ: see لَاقِطٌ, in two places:
-A2-  and see also
لَقِيطَةٌ.
أَلْقَاطٌ pl. of لَقَطٌ, q. v. ―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A small number of
men, separated, or scattered, or dispersed. (S.) ―
-b3-
[Also, perhaps as pl. of لَاقِطٌ, like as أَصْحَابٌ is pl.
of صَاحِبٌ,] (tropical:)  The refuse, or lowest, or basest, or
meanest sort, of mankind, or of people; (K, * TA;)
as also ↓ لُقَّاطٌ [which is doubtless a pl. of لَاقِطٌ,
like as سُقَّاطٍ is of سَاقِطٌ, and مُقَّاطٌ of مَاقِطٌ]. (IAar,
in TA, art. خشر.)
مَلْقَطٌ [A place where a thing is picked up:]
a place where a thing is sought, or to be sought:
a mine: (TA:) [pl. مَلاقِطُ.] ―
-b2-  أَصْبَحَتْ مَرَاعِينَا
مَلَاقِطَ مِنَ الجَدْبِ Our places of pasturage became
dried up, and destitute of herbage, by reason of
the drought. (As.)
مِلْقَطٌ A thing with which, (K,) or in which,
(Jm,) one picks up, or takes up, from the ground:
(Jm, K;) as also ↓ مِلْقَاطٌ. (TA.)

-b2-  The [instrument called]
مِنْقَاش, (K, TA,) with which hair is plucked up.
(TA.)
مَلْقُوطٌ: see لَقِيطٌ, in two places. IAth explains
مَالٌ مَلْقُوطٌ as signifying property found. (TA.)
مُلْتَقَطٌ: see لَقَطٌ, last sentence but two. ―

applied to a thing, i. q. سَاقِطٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Vile, mean, or
paltry]. (TA.)
