لَجْبَةٌ and ↓ لُجْبَةٌ and ↓ لِجْبَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ لَجَبَةٌ
[but see what is said respecting the last of the
pls. mentioned below] and ↓ لَجِبَةٌ and ↓ لِجَبَةٌ
(K) the last two from Th. (TA.) A sheep or
goat (شاة, K), or a sheep only, not a goat,
(ISk, S,) of which the milk has become little in
quantity: (S, K:) or a sheep or goat (شاة)
which has passed four months since her bringing
forth, and of which the milk has in consequence
dried up: (As, S:) or it is an epithet applied
specially to a goat: (K:) a poet (Muhelhil,
TA,) says,
عَجِبَتْ أَبْنَاؤُنَا مِنْ فِعْلِنَا
إِذْ نَبِيعُ الخَيْلَ بِالمِعْزَى اللِّجَابْ
[Our sons wondered at our action, in our selling
horses for goats of which the milk had become
little, or dried up]: (S:) and contr., abounding
with milk: (K:) a poet applies the two epithets
لَجْبَة and حَاشِكَة to the same sheep or goat; but
he may mean that her milk was little at one
time, and abundant at another. (TA.) Pl. [of
لَجْبَةٌ] لِجَابٌ (S, K) and لَجْبَاتٌ (this being
allowed by Mbr, agreeably with analogy, TA)
and لَجَبَاتٌ (S, K): the last dev. with respect to
rule; for by rule it should be لَجْبَاتٌ; unless
it be originally a subst. used as an epithet,
like as one says إِمْرَأَةٌ كَلْبَةٌ; or unless ↓ لَجَبَةٌ
be a syn. of the sing. (S.) Sb says, that
لَجَبَاتٌ is used as pl. because some of the Arabs
used ↓ لَجَبَةٌ as sing. (TA.) ―
-b2-  اللّجب [app.
اللَّجَبُ, a quasi-pl. n.,], occurring in the following
words of a trad., فَيَبْدُو أَمْثَالُ اللجبِ مِنَ الذَّهَبِ,
is said to be pl. of لَجْبَةٌ: or it is اللِّجَبُ, like as
قِصَعٌ is pl. of قَصْعَةٌ. (TA.)
-A2-  In a trad.
respecting Ed-Dejjál, according to one reading,
occur the words, بلجبتى البابِ: but Aboo-Moosà says, that the right reading is with ف
[instead of the ب, and with ى before it: i. e.
بِلَجِيفَتَى الباب: see art. لجف]. (TA.)
