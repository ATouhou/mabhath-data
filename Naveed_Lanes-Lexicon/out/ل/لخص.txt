لخص2
لَخَّصَ لخّصهُ, (A, TA,) inf. n. تَلْخِيصٌ, (S, A, K,)
He explained, expounded, or interpreted, it; (S,
A, K;) he made it clear; (A, K;) namely,
language: (A:) تَلْخِيصٌ and تَبْيِينٌ and شَرْحٌ
and تَخْلِيصٌ all signify the same: (A:) he went
to the utmost point in explaining it, expounding
it, interpreting it, and making it plain: namely,
a thing; as also لحّصهُ. (TA.) You say,
لَخِّصْ لِى خَبَرَكَ Explain thou to me thy news, or
information, thing after thing. (TA.) And it
is said in a trad. of 'Alee, قَعَدَ لِتَلْخِيصِ مَا الْتَبَسَ
عَلَى غَيْرِهِ He sat to make clear what was confused
and dubious to others. (TA.) ―
-b2-  He made it
near: [the inf. n. being explained in the TA
by التقريب; but I incline to think that this is a
mistranscription, for التّعْرِيبُ; and that the meaning is, he made it clear, plain, distinct, or
perspicuous:] he abridged it: he restricted, or
limited, himself in it, namely, a saying, and
abridged of it what was needful. (TA.)
مُلَخَّصٌ The sum or result or conclusion [of a
thing]. (TA.)
لخف لخم لخن لخى
