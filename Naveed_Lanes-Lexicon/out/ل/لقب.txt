لقّبهُ بِكَذَا, inf. n. تَلْقِيبٌ, He called him, or
named him, by such a by-name, or surname, or
nickname; he surnamed him, or nicknamed him,
so. (S, K.) See لَقَبٌ. ―
-b2-  لقّب الإِسْمَ بِالفِعْلِ [i. e.,
بِالفَاءِ وَالعَيْنِ وَاللَّامِ] He called the noun by an
appellation in which its radical letters were represented by ف, ع, and ل; this appellation being
its measure; as when جَوْرَبٌ is called فَوْعَلٌ.

conventional language of lexicology and grammar.]

nicknamed, so. (S, K.) See لَقَبٌ.

لَاقَبَهُ, inf. n. مُلَاقَبَةٌ, He called him by a byname, surname, or nickname; the latter doing to
him the like. (TA.)
6
تَلَاقَبُوا They called one another by by-names,
surnames, or nicknames. (TA.)
لَقَبٌ A by-name; a surname; a nickname;
syn. نَبَزٌ: (S, K:) a name of reproach; an
opprobrious appellation: in this sense forbidden:
(Msb:) it is said in the Kur, xlix., 11, لَا تَنَابَزُوا
بِالْأَلْقَابِ Call not one another by nicknames; i. e.,
let not one of you call another by a name which
he dislikes: (Jel:) also a by-name, or surname,
which is not one of reproach: such are the surnames given to certain Imáms; الأَنْمَشُ and
الأَخْفَشُ and الاَّعْرَجُ and the like; and such are
not forbidden, because by them is not meant
reproach, or disparagement, but they are meant
as mere appellations given with the approval of
the persons to whom they are applied. (Msb.)
[A لَقَب is distinguished from a كُنْيَة, q. v.] Pl.
أَلْقَابٌ. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  [لَقَبُ اسْمٍ The appellation
given to a noun by substituting ف, ع, and ل for
its radical letters. See 2.]
