heard a sound attributable, or to be attributed,
to him, or it; meaning, I heard him, or it, utter

have we (أَىُّ عُذْرٍ لَنَا) in (فِى) [that we should not

rendered What reason, or motive, have we that

or in our not doing &c.? for] the original form
of the phrase is مَا لَنَا فِى أَنْ لَا نَفْعَلَ كَذَا
(Mugh, voce أَنْ.) Often أَنْ is omitted, but
meant to be understood: you say also, مَا لَكَ

-b20-  لَ used as a corroborative, (see S in art. لوم,) after لَوْ and لُوْلَا
the conditional إِنْ, is sometimes difficult to express in English, except by emphasis in pronunciation; as in أَمَا إِنَّهُ لَرَجُلٌ كَرِيمٌ Verily, or now
surely, he is a generous man. This ex. occurs

-b28-  لَ in لَعَمْرُ اللّٰهِ is [not a particle denoting
swearing, but merely] a corroborative of the
inchoative; the enunciative of which, i. e. قَسَمِى,
or مَا أُقْسِمُ بِهِ, is understood. (S, art. عمر.) ―
-b29-
يَا لَزَيْدٍ, and يَالَ زَيْدٍ, accord. to the Koofees, is
a contraction of يَا آلَ زَيْدٍ. (Mugh, letter ل; and
El-Ashmoonee on the Alfeeyeh, الاستفاثة.) It
seems that where the ل is not connected with
the word following it, يَالَ is generally, if not
always, for يَا آلَ; and so sometimes when it is
connected. See يَالَ غُدَرَ, voce غَادِرٌ, and see
عَجَبٌ. See also De Sacy's Gr. Ar., 2nd ed.,
i. 476, note.
لَا, the negative, does not necessarily restrict
to the signification of future time a marfooa aor.
following it: in a case of this kind, مَا is often
substituted for it in the explanation of a phrase;
as in the instance of لَا يَعْرِفُ هِرَّا مِنْ بِرٍّ, in the
TA, art. بر; and the aor. is more properly rendered by the present than by the future. ―
-b2-
لَا رَجُلَ قَائِمٌ There is not any man standing:
(Mugh:) but when the subst. and epithet are
both simple words, and not separated, the latter
may be used in three different ways; as in
لَا رَجُلَ ظَرِيفَ and ظَرِيفًا and ظَرِيفٌ; otherwise
it must be marfooa or mansoob, but not mebnee:
this relates to لا used لِنَفْىِ الجِنْسِ. (Ibn-'Akeel,
p. 165.) ―
-b3-  لا, also, Lest. See رَكَبَهُ. ―
-b4-
[لَا لَهُ وَلَا عَلَيْهِ There is nothing due to him,
nor anything to be demanded of him. (Thus I
have rendered this phrase, voce مَلَسَى, in three
places.) For] when لا is a general negative, the
context renders it allowable to suppress its subject, as in لَا عَلَيْكَ, for لَا بَأْسَ عَلَيْكَ; and sometimes the predicate, when known, is suppressed,
as in لَا بَأْسَ. (Msb.) ―
-b5-  لَاشَ, for لَا شَىْءَ: see
art. لوش. ―
-b6-  كَلَا وَلَا [As the time occupied in
saying لَا وَلَا]. See an ex. in the TA, voce لوْذَان.
―
-b7-  لَا وَلَا Olive-oil: in allusion to the words
in the Kur xxiv. 35, occurring in a trad. ―
-b8-
لَا يَقْرَأِ, as a prohibition, and لا يَقْرَأُ as an enunciative with the same meaning: see a trad. thus
commencing in the Jámi' es-Sagheer: and see
the Kur lvi. 78: and see an ex. voce رَهْنٌ. ―
-b9-
لَا أَغَرُّ وَلَا بَهِيمٌ: see بَهِيمٌ. ―
-b10-  لَا in a case of
pausation pronounced لَأْ: see art. ا (near the
end).
