passage from which, quoted in the TA, seems to
have been there corrupted by the copyist,) if لَبَاةٌ

alleviation of hemzeh from لَبْأَةٌ, its pl. is لَبَآتٌ,]
and (of لُبَأَةٌ, TA,) لُبَأٌ and (of لَبْوَةٌ, TA,) لَبُوَاتٌ

are thus given in the TA &c. In the CK, the
pls. are given as follows: لَبْآتٌ and لُبُوْءٌ and لُبُؤٌ
and لَبُوَاتٌ.] Each of the singulars may have a
perfect, or sound, pl., ending with ات. (MF.)
