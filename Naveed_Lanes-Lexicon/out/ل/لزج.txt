لَزِجَ, aor.

لُزُوجَةٌ (M) and لُزُوجٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ تلزّج;
(M;) It (a thing, S) stretched out, in a neut.
sense: it roped; or drew out, with a viscous,
glutinous, clammy, cohesive, sticky, ropy, or slimy,
continuity of parts: syn. تَمَطَّطَ and تَمَدَّدَ:
(S, K:) it was, or became, viscous, glutinous,
clammy, cohesive, sticky, ropy, or slimy, so as to
adhere to the hand and the like. (Msb.) ―
-b2-
لَزِجَ بِهِ It adhered to him, or it, as glue or the
like; syn. غَرِىَ. (S, K.) E. g. أَكَلْتُ شَيْئًا فَلَزِجَ
بِأَصَابِعِى I ate a thing and it adhered to my
fingers. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  [And] ↓ تلزّج It (food, or
ointment,) became [viscous, glutinous, clammy,
cohesive, sticky, slimy, ropy, or mucilaginous,]
like خِطْمِىّ [or marsh-mallow]. (M, &c.) ―
-b4-
النَّبَاتُ ↓ تلزّج i. q. تَلَجَّنَ: (S, K:) i. e., The
herbage became flaccid, and one part thereof inclined over another: (TA:) [or became flaccid,
and of a viscous consistency, or viscous or mucilaginous in its juice; as appears from what here
follows]. Ru-beh says, [in the S, El-'Ajjáj,]
describing a pair af asses, male and female,
وَفَرَعَا مِنْ رَعْىِ مَا تَلَزَّجَا
[And they finished pasturing upon what had
become flaccid, and of a viscous consistency].
For, says J, [immediately after citing these
words of the poet,] when herbage begins to dry
up, its juice thickens, and becomes like the
mucilage of the خِطْمِىّ [or marsh-mallow].
(TA.) Or the words of the poet, above quoted,
signify, And they finished pasturing upon what
they had searched after constantly, or time after
time: for تَلَزُّجٌ also signifies the searching of a
beast of carriage after herbage and leguminous
plants, constantly, or time after time: and the
two asses are here the agents of the verb تلزّجا.
