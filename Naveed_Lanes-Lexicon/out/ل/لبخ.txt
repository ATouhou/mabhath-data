لبخلَبَخٌ, (L, K,) or لَبْخٌ, (as mentioned by AHn.,
on the authority of another, [but see below,])
[a coll. gen. n., n. un. with ة, The persea of Theophrastus and Dioscorides; (De Sacy, “Relation
de l'Egypte par Abd-Allatif,” in which see a full
and learned disquisition respecting this tree,
pp. 47 et seqq.)] described to AHn, by a man
acquainted with it, as growing at Ansinè, in
Upper Egypt, as a kind of large tree, resembling
the دُلْب [or plane-tree], having a green fruit,
resembling the date, very sweet, but disagreeable,
excellent for pain in the teeth: when it is sawn, it
[meaning the saw-dust] makes blood to flow from
the nose of him who saws it: it is sawn into
planks, and a plank of it obtains the price of
fifty deenárs: it is used in the building of ships:
they assert that if two planks of it be strongly
attached together, and put in water for a year,
they unite, and form one plank: in the T it is not
said that they are put in water for a year, nor for
less, nor for more: some assert that this tree, in
Persia, killed; but when transplanted to Egypt,
it became such that [the fruit of] it was eaten,
without injuring: Ibn-Beytár mentions it. (L,
and parts also in the K.) The n. un. is also
explained as the name of a certain great tree,
like the أَثْأَبَة, or greater, the leaves of which
resemble those of the walnut-tree (الجَوْز), having
a fruit like that of the حَمَاط, bitter in taste,
which, when eaten, excites thirst; and when water
is drunk upon it, inflates the belly: it is one of
the trees of the mountains. (AHn, L.) [In a
verse cited by AHn, the coll. appellation of this
latter tree is read لَبَخ, with fet-h to the ل and
ب.] [The name of لَبَخ is now given in Egypt
to a kind of acacia; the mimosa lebbeck of
Linnæus: and لَبَخُ الجَبَل, to the menispermum
leæba of Delile; the leæba of Forskal. See
also لُبَاجٌ.]
لُبَاخٌ: see لُبَاخِيَّةٌ.
لُبُوخٌ Fleshiness of the body. (K.)
لَبِيخٌ A fleshy man. (L, K.)
لُبَاخِيَّةٌ A fleshy woman: (L, K:) bulky, or
corpulent: tall, and large in body: (L:) perfect
[in body or make]: as though it were a rel. n.
from ↓ اللُّبَاخ, [which is app. a word of no
meaning; or perhaps, but this I think improbable,
another name of the great tree called لَبْخ, or لَبَخ,
or the name of a place]. (S, L.)
