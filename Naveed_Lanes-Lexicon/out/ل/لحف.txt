لحفلِحَافٌ: see what follows.
مِلْحَفَةٌ A مُلَآءَة that is سُمُط [not lined, nor
stuffed]: if lined or stuffed, the vulgar also
call it by this name, but the Arabs do not know
this: (L, TA:) and the same applies to the
↓ لِحَاف: Az says, that لِحَافٌ and مِلْحَفٌ mean
the same: like إِزَارٌ and مِئْزَرٌ, and قِرَامٌ and مِقْرَمٌ;
and sometimes one says مِقْرَمَةٌ and مِلْحَفَةٌ; and
it is the same whether the garment be سُمُط or
lined. (TA.) He says also, [in another place,]
that the Arabs apply the terms ↓ لِحَافٌ and مِلْحَفَةٌ
to A night-wrapper (إِزَارُ لَيْلِ) if it be طَاقٌ وَاحِدٌ
[a single piece of stuff; i. e. not double, not lined
nor faced, nor stuffed]. (TA in art. سمط.) ―
