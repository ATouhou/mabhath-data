ظلع1
ظَلَعَ, aor.
ظَلَعَ, inf. n. ظَلْعٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,
K,) said of a camel, (S, O, Msb, K,) and of a
man also, (Msb, TA,) and, by Aboo-Dhu-eyb,
of a horse, (S, TA,) [and likewise said of a dog,
(see ظَالِعٌ,)] He limped, or halted, syn. غَمَزَ فِى
مَشْيِهِ, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) and عَرِجَ; (TA;) or
was slightly lame: (Mgh:) what it signifies
resembles عَرَجٌ [or natural lameness], and therefore
it is said to be a slight عَرَج. (Msb.) One says,
اِرْقَ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ, (S, O, L, K,) a prov., (O, L,)
meaning Ascend thou the mountain with knowledge
[or because] of thy limping, or slight lameness, not
jading thyself: (L:) or deal gently with thyself, and
burden not thyself with more than thou art able to
do: (S:) or impose upon thyself, of what is difficult,
[only] what thou art able to do; for he who ascends
a ladder or stair, or a mountain, when he is one
who limps, or has a slight lameness, deals gently
with himself; i. e. exceed not thy proper limit in
thy threatening, but see thy deficiency, and thine
impotence to execute it: (O, K: *) and some say
اِرْقَأْ, with, meaning rectify thine affair first;
(O, K;) or as meaning abstain, and restrain
thyself; (O;) or, accord. to AZ, abstain thou,
for I know thy vices, or faults: (TA:) or the
meaning of both is, be silent, because, or in consideration, of the fault that is in thee. (Ks, O,
K. *) One says also, اِرْقِ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ, with kesr
to the ق, [meaning Charm thou thy slight lameness, to cure it,] from الرُّقْيَةُ: and it is said in
another prov.,
اِرْقِ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ أَنْ يُهَاضَا
[app. meaning Charm thou thy slight lameness,
that it may become mitigated: see art. هيض: the
final ا in يهاضا being what is termed أَلِفُ الإِطْلَاقِ,
not a radical]. (O, K.) And قِ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ [Be
cautious, because, or in consideration, of thy
limping]: said when there is a vice, or fault, in
a man, and you chide him in order that it may
not be called to mind: (O, K: [for يَذْكُرَ in the
CK, I read يُذْكَرَ, as in other copies of the K
and in the O:]) and to this he replies, or may
reply, وَقَيْتُ. (TA. [See also art. وقى.]) And
اِرْبَعْ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ [Act gently, or with deliberation,
or restrain thyself, because of thy limping];
meaning thou art weak; therefore refrain from
that which thou art not able to do. (O, K. [See
also art. ربع.]) And لَا يَرْبَعُ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ مَنْ لَيْسَ
يَحْزُنُهُ أَمْرُكَ, meaning He will not mind thine
affair (Hr, O, K) whom thy condition does not
grieve: (Hr, O:) or, originally, he will not pause
because of thy limping, when thou laggest behind
thy companions on account of thy weakness, who
does not care for thy case. (Hr, O, K. * [See,
again, art. ربع.]) ―
-b2-  Also, said of a man, (tropical:)  He
stopped short, and lagged behind. (TA.) ―
-b3-
ظَلَعَتِ الأَرْضُ بِأَهْلِهَا (tropical:)  The land became straitened
with its inhabitants, by reason of their multitude;
(A 'Obeyd, S, O, K;) it would not bear them, by
reason of their multitude, like the beast that limps
with its load because of its heaviness. (Z, TA.)
―
-b4-  ظَلَعَت said of a bitch, (tropical:)  She desired copulation.
(As, O, K, TA.) And ظَلَعَ said of a dog, (assumed tropical:)  He
desired to copulate. (TA.)
-A2-  ظَلَعَتْ عَيْنَهَا She
(a woman) contracted and inclined her eye.
(TA.)

اظلع He made his camel, or beast, that he
rode, to limp, or become lame. (A, TA.)

تَظَلَّعَ In the following saying of a poet,
وَمَا ذَاكَ مِنْ جُرْمٍ أَتَيْتُهُمُ بِهِ
وَلَا حَسَدٍ مِنِّى لَهُمْ يَتَظَلَّعُ
ISd thinks the meaning to be, [And that was not
a crime, or an offence, that I committed against
them, nor envy on my part] arising in their
minds, and occurring hastily to their understandings. (TA.)
ظَلَعٌ, thus with fet-h to the ل, A declining from
the truth, or from that which is right; and a sin,
crime, fault, or misdeed. (TA.)
ظُلَاعٌ A disease in the legs of a beast, not from
journeying nor from fatigue, (Lth, K, TA, [in
the O inadvertently written ضُلَاع,]) in consequence of which it limps. (Lth, TA.)
ظَالِعٌ Limping, or halting; [or slightly lame;]
applied to a camel, and a horse, [&c.,] (S,)
[i. e.,] to a beast, (TA,) to the male and the
female alike, (Lth, O, K, TA,) to the former as
a part. n., and to the latter as a possessive noun,
(TA,) like غَامِزٌ; (Lth, O, TA;) or the fem. of
ظَالِعٌ is ظَالِعَةٌ, (S, O, K, TA,) but one does not
say غَامِزَةٌ: (O, TA:) [pl. ظُلَّعٌ.] One says, لَا
أَنَامُ حَتَّى يَنَامَ ظَالِعُ الكِلَابِ [I will not sleep until
the limping dog sleeps]; (O, K;) a prov., (O,)
meaning, until the dogs become still; (O, K;)
because the ظالع, of dogs, waits until there remains none other, and then copulates, and sleeps:
(As, O, K:) ―
-b2-  or the ظالع is the dog that is
lusting for the female; for such does not sleep;
and the saying is applied to him who is mindful
of his affair, who does not neglect it: ―
-b3-  or the
bitch that is lusting for the male; because the
dogs follow her, and will not let her sleep. (O,
K.) ―
-b4-  Also Inclining, or declining: (O, K:)
like ضَالِعٌ. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And [Declining from the
truth, or from that which is right; (see ظَلَعٌ;)]
committing a sin, crime, fault, or misdeed. (TA.)
―
-b6-  And Suspected. (S, O, K.)
-A2-  In the saying
of Ru-beh,
فَإِنْ تُخَالِجْنَ العُيُونَ الظُّلَّعَا
[And if ye women vie with the contracted and
inclined eyes], he means المَظْلُوعَةَ, [see 1, last
sentence,] using the word in the manner of a
possessive noun. (TA.)
مُظْلِعٌ, applied to a load, i. q. مُضْلِعٌ [i. e.
Heavily burdening, or overburdening, &c.; or
causing to limp]. (TA.)
مِظْلَاعٌ an epithet applied to a horse [and the
like, as meaning That limps, or halts, much].
(TA.)
