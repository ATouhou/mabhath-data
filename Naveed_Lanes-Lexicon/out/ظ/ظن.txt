ظن1
ظَنَّ, aor.
ظَنُ3َ, inf. n. ظَنٌّ, (Msb,) [He thought,
opined, supposed, or conjectured: and he doubted:
and he knew, but not by ocular perception: see
ظَنٌّ below:] you say, ظَنَنْتُ الشَّىْءَ, aor. أَظُنُّهُ,
inf. n. ظَنٌّ; and ↓ اِظَّنَنْتُهُ and اِظْطَنَنْتُهُ; and
↓ تَظَنَّنْتُهُ and تَظَنَّيْتُهُ, this last formed by changing
the last ن into ى: [i. e. I thought the thing,
&c:] and Lh mentions, as heard from the
Benoo-Suleym, ظَنْتُ ذَاكَ i. e. ظَنَنْتُ ذاك [I
thought that, &c.] like ظَلْتُ and other instances
of the dial. of Suleym. (M.) [In the first of
the senses expl. above, it governs two objective
complements, which are originally an inchoative
and an enunciative:] you say, ظَنَنْتُكَ زَيْدًا [I
thought thee Zeyd, originally I thought thou wast
Zeyd], and ظَنَنْتُ زَيْدًا إِيَّاكَ [I thought Zeyd
thee, originally I thought Zeyd was thou], denoting
by a pronoun what is originally an inchoative [in
the former phrase] and what is originally an
enunciative [in the latter phrase]. (S, TA.) It
is also used [in this sense] in the same manner as
a verb signifying an oath, the Arabs giving it
the same kind of complement, saying, ظَنَنْتُ لَعَبْدُ
اللّٰهِ خَيْرٌ مِنْكَ [I thought surely 'Abd-Allah was
better than thou]. (S in art. درد.) [ظَنَّ بِهِ كَذَا
means I thought of him, or it, such a thing: and
I thought such a thing to be in him, or it: and is
used in relation to good and to evil.] It is said
in the Kur [xxxiii. 10], وَتَطُنُّونَ بِاللّٰهِ الظُّنُونَا [And
ye were thinking, of God, various thoughts]. (M.)
Accord. to Sb, ظَنَنْتُ بِهِ means I made him, or
it, the place [i. e. object] of my ظَنّ [or thought,
&c.]. (M.) [In all these exs. the verb denotes
a state of mind between doubt and certainty, but
the latter is predominant: and hence ظَنَّ sometimes means He doubted: and sometimes, he
knew, by considering with endeavour to understand, not by ocular perception; being more frequently used in this sense than as meaning “ he
doubted,” though not so frequently as it is in the
sense of “ he thought,” whence the meaning “ he
knew ” is held by some to be tropical.] إِنَّى,
ظَنَنْتُ أَنِّى مُلَاقٍ حِسَابِيَهْ, in the Kur [lxix. 20],
means Verily I knew [that I should meet with my
reckoning]. (T.) And الَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُمْ مُلَاقُو
رَبِّهِمْ, in the same [ii. 43], means Who know
[that they shall meet their Lord, lit., be meeters of
their Lord]. (Msb.) And ظَنَنْتُ مَا قَالَ, occurring in a trad., means I knew [what he meant to
say by his making a sign with his hand]. (TA.)
―
-b2-  ظَنَنْتُهُ, (M, Mgh, Msb,) aor. as above, (Msb,)
and so the inf. n., (M,) signifies also I suspected
him; thought evil of him; (M, Mgh, Msb;)
and (M) so ↓ اِظَّنَنْتُهُ (S, M, Mgh, K) and
اِظْطَنَنْتُهُ (M, TA) and اِطَّنَنْتُهُ. (TA.) [Thus,
too, ↓ أَظْنَنْتُهُ accord. to several copies of the S
and accord. to the CK; but this is app. a mistranscription.] In the saying of Ibn-Seereen, لَمْ
فِى قَتْلِ عُثْمَانَ ↓ يَكُنْ عَلِىٌّ يُظَّنُّ, (T, S, K, but in
the T مَا كَان,) meaning Alee was not suspected
[in the case of the slaying of 'Othmán], (T,)
يُظَّنُّ is of the measure يُفْتَعَلُ, originally يُظْتَنُّ:
(T, S, K:) so says A'Obeyd: (T:) or, as some
relate it, the word is يُطَّنُّ. (TA.) One says,
بِكَذَا ↓ هُوَ يُظَّنُّ and يُطَّنُّ, meaning He is suspected of such a thing. (TA in art. طن.) And
طَنَنْتُ بِزَيْدٍ and ظَنَنْتُ زَيْدًا I suspected Zeyd: in
this sense the verb has a single objective complement. (TA.)
4
أَظْنَنْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ I made him to think the thing.
(M, TA.) ―
-b2-  And أَظْنَنْتُ بِهِ النَّاسَ [I made the
people to suspect him: or] I exposed him to suspicion; (M, Msb, TA;) [and] so أَظنَنْتُهُ [alone].
(K.) ―
-b3-  See also 1, last quarter.
5
التَّظَنِّى means The exercising, employing, or
using, of الظَّنّ [i. e. thought, &c.]; originally
التَّظَنُّنُ. (S, K.) A'Obeyd says, تَظَنَّيْتُ is from
ظَنَنْتُ, and is originally تَظَنَّنْتُ; the ن being
many, one of them is changed into ى: it is like
قَصَّيْتُ, which is originally قَصَّصْتُ. (T.)
-A2-  See
also 1, first sentence.

إِظْتَنَ3َ see 1, first sentence: ―
-b2-  and again, in the
last quarter, in three places.
ظَنٌّ is a simple subst. as well as an inf. n.;
(TA;) and signifies Thought, opinion, supposition, or conjecture: (Er-Rághib, Mgh, TA:)
or a preponderant belief, with the admission that
the contrary may be the case: (KT, El-Munáwee, TA:) or a preponderating wavering
between the two extremes in indecisive belief:
(K:) or an inference from a sign, or mark, or
token; when strong, leading to knowledge; and
when weak, not exceeding the limit of وَهْم: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or doubt or uncertainty; (T, M;)
or it has this meaning also; (Er-Rághib, TA;)
contr. of يَقِينٌ: (Msb:) and sometimes it is put
in the place, (S, K,) or used in the sense, (Mgh,
Msb,) of عِلْمٌ, (S, Mgh, K,) or يَقِينٌ, (Msb,)
[i. e. knowledge, or certainty,] in which sense it
is [held by some to be] tropical; (Mgh;) or it
signifies also knowledge, or certainty, (يَقِينٌ, T,
M,) such as is obtained by considering with endeavour to understand, not by ocular perception,
(M,) or not such as relates to an object of sense:
(MF:) and it also means suspicion, or evil
opinion: (Er-Rághib, TA: [but in this last sense,
ظِنَّةٌ is more common:]) as a subst., (TA,) its pl.
is ظُنُونٌ and أَظَانِينُ, (M, K, TA,) the latter
anomalous, or (as ISd says, TA) it may be pl.
of ↓ أُظْنُونَةٌ, but this I do not know. (M, TA.)
One says, هُوَ سَيِّئُ الظَّنِّ بِكُلِّ أَحَدٍ [He is evil in
opinion of everyone]. (M.) [And سَآءَ ظَنُّهُ بِفُلَانٍ
His opinion of such a one was evil.] And عِلْمُهُ
بِالشَّىْءِ ظُنُونٌ [His knowledge is but opinions];
meaning that no confidence is to be placed in him.
(TA.)
ظِنَّةٌ Suspicion, or evil opinion; (T, S, M,
Mgh, Msb, K;) as also طِنَّةٌ; the ظ being
changed into ط, though there is no إِدْغَام in this
case, because of their being accustomed to say
اِطَّنَّ [for اِظَّنَّ, which is for اِظْطَنَّ]; an instance
like الدِّكْرُ, which is made to accord with اِدَّكَرَ
[for اِذَّكَرَ, which is for اِذْدَكَرَ], as mentioned by
Sb; (M;) and ↓ ظَنَانَةٌ, (so accord. to a copy of
the M,) or ↓ ظِنَانَةٌ, like كِتَابَةٌ, (TA,) signifies
the same: (M, TA:) the pl. of ظِنَّةٌ is ظِنَنٌ.
(S, K.) One says, عِنْدَهُ ظِنَّتِى and هُوَ ظِنَّتِى,
meaning He is the place [i. e. object] of my
suspicion. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And [hence] (assumed tropical:)  A little [like
the French “ soupçon ”] of a thing. (TA.)
ظُنَنٌ: see ظَنَّانٌ.
ظَنُونٌ A man who thinks evil (S, M) of everyone. (M.) ―
-b2-  A man possessing little good or
goodness: or, as some say, of whom one asks [a
thing] thinking that he will refuse, and who is as
he was thought to be: (M:) [or] ↓ ظَنِينٌ has this
latter meaning. (TA.) ―
-b3-  A man in whose goodness no trust, or confidence, is to be placed. (M.)
And Anything in which no trust, or confidence, is
to be placed, (M, TA,) of water, and of other
things; (TA;) as also ↓ ظَنِينٌ. (M, TA.) A
well (بِئْرٌ) having little water, (S, M, K,) in the
water of which no trust, or confidence, is to be
placed: (M:) or a well, (S, K,) or a drinkingplace, (M,) of which one knows not whether there
be in it water or not: (S, M, K:) or water
which one imagines, or supposes, to exist, but of
which one is not sure. (TA.) كُلُّ مَنِيَّةٍ ظَنُونٌ
إِلَّا القَتْلَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللّٰهِ is a saying mentioned, but
not expl., by IAar; [app. meaning Every death
is doubtful as to its consequence except slaughter
in the way, or cause, of God; but ISd says,] in
my opinion the meaning is that it is of little good
and profit. (M.) دَيْنٌ ظَنُونٌ means A debt of
which one knows not whether he who owes it will
pay it or not: (A'Obeyd, T, S, M, * K:) it is
said in a trad. of 'Omar that there is no poorrate in the case of such a debt. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Also
A man suspected in relation to his intellect, or intelligence. (Aboo-Tálib, TA.) And A woman
suspected in relation to her grounds of pretension
to respect, or honour, on account of lineage &c.
(TA.) And A woman of noble rank or quality,
who is taken in marriage, (M, K,) from a desire
of obtaining off spring by her, when she is advanced
in age. (M.) ―
-b5-  Also A weak man. (K. [See
also ظَنينٌ.]) ―
-b6-  And A man having little artifice,
cunning, ingenuity, or skill. (K.)
ظَنِينٌ Suspected; (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;)
applied to a man; (S, M;) i. q. ↓ مَظْنُونٌ,
(Mbr, Msb,) in this sense: (Msb:) pl. أَظِنَّآءُ.
(M, TA.) Thus in the saying in the Kur [lxxxi.
24], وَمَا هُوَ عَلَى الْغَيْبِ بِظَنِينٍ, (T, M, Msb,)
meaning And he is not suspected as to what he
makes known from God, of the knowledge of
that which is undiscoverable, as is related on the
authority of 'Alee: or, accord. to Fr, it may mean
weak; for ظَنِينٌ may have this meaning like as
ظَنُونٌ has: (T:) some read بِضَنينٍ. (TA in art.
ضن, q. v.) شَهَادَةُ ظَنِينٍ, which is said in a trad.
to be not allowable, is The testimony of one who
is suspected as to his religion. (TA.) And نَفْسٌ
↓ ظَنَّآءُ means [A soul, or person,] suspected.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Also One who treats or regards
another, or others, with enmity, or hostility; (T,
M;) because of his evil opinion and the evil
opinion of which he is an object. (M.) ―

also ظَنُونٌ, in two places.
ظَنَانَةٌ or ظِنَانَةٌ: see ظِنَّةٌ.
ظَنَّآءُ: see ظَنِينٌ.
ظَنَّانٌ One who opines, or conjectures, much
[and] in an evil manner; as also ↓ ظُنَنٌ. (TA.)

should think of him to do a thing]. You say,
نَظَرْتُ إِلَى أَظَنِّهِمْ أَنْ يَفْعَلَ ذٰلِكَ I looked towards
him who was the most fit of them that I should
think of him to do that. (M, TA.)
أُظْنُونَةٌ: see ظَنٌّ, near the end.
مَظِنَّةٌ, (M, Mgh, Msb, TA,) of which مَظَنَّةٌ,
mentioned by Ibn-Málik and others, and مِظَنَّةٌ,
are dial. vars., (TA,) or [rather] مَظِنَّةُ شَىْءٍ,
(IF, S, Msb, K, TA,) signifies The place, (IF,
S, Msb, K, TA,) and the accustomed place, (IF,
S, Msb, TA,) in which is thought to be the
existence, (S, K, TA,) of a thing; (IF, S, Msb,
K, TA;) [a place] where a thing is thought to
be: (M:) or it signifies, (Mgh, Msb,) or signifies also, (S,) a place where a thing is known to
be: (S, Mgh, Msb:) [a thing, and a person, in
which, or in whom, a thing, or quality, is thought,
supposed, presumed, suspected, inferred, known,
or accustomed, to be, or exist:] accord. to IAth,
by rule it should be مَظَنَّةٌ: (TA:) [it may therefore be properly rendered a cause of thinking,
&c., the existence of a thing; and مَظِنَّةٌ لِكَذَا may
be well expl. as meaning a thing, and a person,
that occasions one's thinking, supposing, presuming
suspecting, inferring, or knowing, the existence of
such a thing or quality, in it, or in him: and
hence, an indication, or evidence, or a symptom,
diagnostic, characteristic, sign, mark, or token, of
the existence of such a thing or quality:] the pl.
is مَظَانُّ. (M, Mgh, Msb, TA.) One says, مَوْضِعُ
كَذَا مَظِنَّةٌ مِنْ فُلَانٍ i. e. Such a place is a place
in which such a one is known [&c.] to be. (S,
TA.) And فُلَانٌ مَظِنَّةٌ مِنْ كَذَا i. e. Such a one
is one in whom such a thing, or quality, is known
[&c.] to be. (Lh, T.) And فُلَانٌ مَظِنَّةٌ لِلْخَيْرِ

is thought [&c.] to be. (Ham p. 437.) And En-Nábighah says,
فَإِنْ يَكُ عَامِرٌ قَدْ قَالَ جَهْلًا
فَإِنَّ مَظِنَّةَ الجَهْلِ الشَّبَابُ
[And if 'Ámir has spoken ignorantly, verily
youthfulness is a state in which ignorance is
usually found to exist]: (S, Msb: *) or, as some
relate the verse, السِّبَابُ [so that the meaning is,
mutual reviling is an act in which &c.]: (S:)
or, accord. to another relation, the latter hemistich is
فَإِنَّ مَطِيَّةَ الجَهْلِ الشَّبَابُ
(S, * TA;) because one finds it [i. e. youthfulness] to be easy like as he does the beast on
which one rides. (TA.) And one says also,
طَلَبَهُ مَظَانَّهُ [He sought him, or it, in the places
where he, or it, was thought to be;] meaning, by
night and by day. (TA.) And إِنَّهُ لَمَظِنَّةٌ أَنْ
يَفْعَلَ ذٰلِكَ i. e. Verily he is apt, meet, fitted, or
suited, for one to think of his doing that: and in
like manner one says of two, and of a pl. number,
and of a female. (Lh, M.)

it means [Doubted; or] of which one is not to be
made to know the real state. (TA in art. رجم.)
