tough edge of the shin: or the external part of the
shank: (M, TA:) or the shin-bone: or the edge
of the shin-bone: (M, K:) or the tough bone in

ظَنَابِيبُ. (S, M, K.) عَارِى الظَّنَابِيبِ Without

a male ostrich. (S, TA.) قَرَعَ ظُنْبُوبَ البَعِيرِ
means He knocked, or struck, the shin of the
camel, that he might lie down, and he might
mount him: or قَرْعُ الظُّنْبُوبِ signifies a man's
knocking, or striking, the shin of his camel with
his stick when he makes him lie down that he may
mount him, as one in haste to betake himself to
a thing: or striking the shin of his beast with his
whip, [in the TA is here added ليترقه, which I
can only suppose to be put for لِيُبْرِكَهُ, to make
him lie down,] when he desires to mount him.
(TA.) [See an ex. voce عُرْقُوبٌ. Hence,] قَرَعَ
فُلَانٌ لِأَمْرِهِ ظُنْبُوبَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one struck his shin
to betake himself to his affair] means such a one
applied himself to his affair with diligence, or
energy. (T, L, TA.) Selámeh Ibn-Jendel says,
كُنَّا إِذَا مَا أَتَانَا صَارِخٌ فَزِعٌ
كَانَ الصُّرَاخُ لَهُ قَرْعَ الظَّنَابِيبِ
[We were (such that), when there came to us one
crying aloud, in terror, the clamour (returned) to
him was the striking of the shins;] by which he is
said to mean that a quick reply was given;
calling the striking of the whip upon the leg of
the boot, in urging on the horse, “the striking of
the shin. ” (S.) You also say, قَرَعَ لِذٰلِكَ الأَمْرِ
ظُنْبُوبَهُ meaning (assumed tropical:)  He prepared himself for that
affair, or thing: and agreeably with this signification the verse of Selámeh cited above has been
explained. (M, TA.) And قَرَعَ ظَنَابِيبَ الأَمْرِ
(tropical:)  He made, or rendered, the affair manageable.
(M, K, TA.) A poet, cited by IAar, says,
قَرَعْتُ ظَنَابِيبَ الْهَوَى يَوْمَ عَالِجٍ
(tropical:)  I subdued love, or subjected it to my will, on the
day of 'Álij;. as though I struck it on the shins;
as a camel's shin is struck when one desires him
to lie down, that he may mount him. (M, TA.)
―
-b2-  ظُنْبُوبٌ also signifies A nail that is in the جُبَّة
of a spear-head, [i. e., in the part into which the
shaft enters,] (M, K,) where it is fixed upon the
upper extremity of the shaft: and ظَنَابِيب has
been said to be the pl. of the word in this sense
in the verse of Selámeh cited above. (M, TA.)
