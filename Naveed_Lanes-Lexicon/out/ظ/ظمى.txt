أُظْمِىَ, inf. n. إِظْمَآءٌ, He (a horse) was made
lean, or lank; as also ↓ ظُمِّىَ, inf. n. تَظْمِيَةٌ. (T,
TA. [See also 4 in art. ظمأ.])
ظَمًى is the inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]: and [it is said
that it] signifies The withering, or drying up, of
the lip, from thirst: (M:) so says Lth: but it
signifies paucity of the flesh and blood of the lip;
not the withering, or drying-up, in consequence of
thirst: it is a quality that is commended: (T:)
or a tawny, or brownish, or dusky, colour, and a
withering, or drying-up, in the lip. (S.) ―
-b2-  And
Paucity of the blood of the gum: (Lth, T:) or
paucity of the blood and flesh of the gum. (M.)
[In the T is added ويعتريه الحُسْنُ: and in the
M, وهو يعترى الحُبْسَ, in which الحُبْسَ seems to
be evidently a mistranscription for الحُبْشَ: I
therefore think it most probable that in the T,
as well as in the M, the right reading is وَهُوَ
يَعْتَرِى الحُبْشَ, meaning and it is incidental to
the Abyssinians.] ―
-b3-  And Tawniness of a spearshaft. (T.)

that is not swollen, [not] having much blood;
(T;) accord. to Lth, from thirst; but AZ says
that it is not so: (TA: [see ظَمًى:]) or a lip in
which is a tawny, or brownish, or dusky, colour,
and a withering, or lack of moisture: (S:) or a
lip withering, or withered, or lacking moisture,
inclining to a tawny, or brownish, or dusky,
colour. (K.) ―
