ظalphabetical letter
ظ
The seventeenth letter of the alphabet: called ظَآءٌ
[and ظَا]. (TA.) It is a letter peculiar to the
Arabic language; and is one of the letters termed
مَجْهُورَة [or vocal, i. e. pronounced with the voice,
not with the breath only]; and of the letters
termed لِثَوِيَّة [or gingival], like ث and ذ. (TA.)
As it does not exist in the language of the
Nabathæans, they change it into ط. (IF, TA.)
[It is substituted for the ت in the measure اِفْتَعَلَ
and the forms inflected therefrom when immediately following ظ; as in اِظَّلَمَ, for اِظْظَلَمَ, for
اِظْتَلَمَ:] and it is substituted for ذ; as in تَرَكْتُهُ
وَقِيذًا and وَقِيظًا; as is related on the authorities
of ISk and Kr; and as in أَرْضٌ جِلْذَآءٌ and جِلْظَآءٌ,
as is mentioned in the Nawádir el-Aaráb. (TA.)
-A2-  [As a numeral, it denotes Nine hundred.]
