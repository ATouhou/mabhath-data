ظَهَرَ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) aor.
ظَهَرَ, (Msb,) inf. n.
ظُهُورٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,) [It was, or became, outward, exterior, external, extrinsic, or
exoteric: and hence,] it appeared; became apparent, overt, open, perceptible or perceived,
manifest, plain, or evident; (S, Mgh, Msb, K,
TA;) after having been concealed, or latent:
(Msb, TA:) and ↓ تظاهر signifies the same.
(Har p. 85.) Hence the phrase ظَهَرَ لِى رَأْىٌ (assumed tropical:)  [An
idea, or opinion, occurred to me], said when one
knows what he did not know before. (Msb.)
[And هٰذَا مَا يَظْهَرُ لِى (assumed tropical:)  This is what appears to
me to be the case, or to be the right way or
course; or this is my opinion.] ظَهَرَ الحَمْلُ,
inf. n. as above, means Pregnancy became apparent, or manifest: it is said that this is not the
case in less than three months. (Msb.) And
it is said in a trad. of 'Áïsheh, كَانَ يُصَلِّى العَصْرَ
فِى حُجْرَتِى قَبْلَ أَنْ تَظْهَرَ i. e. [He used to perform the prayer of the afternoon in my chamber]
before it (meaning the sun) became high and apparent: (TA:) or وَالشَّمْسُ فِى حُجْرَتِى لَمْ تَظْهَرْ
بَعْدُ i. e. [when the sun was in my chamber,] it not
having risen high so as to be on the flat roof
[thereof]: referring to the Prophet. (O. [But العَصْرَ
must be a mistranscription for الفَجْرَ, i. e. the
prayer of the dawn.]) The saying in the Kur
[xxiv. 31], وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا [which
is app. best rendered And that they discover not
their ornature except what is external thereof] has
been expl. in seven different ways, most correctly
as meaning the clothes: (O, TA:) accord. to
'Áïsheh, it means the bracelet (القُلْب) and the
ring (الفَتَخَة): and accord. to I'Ab, the hand and
the signet-ring and the face. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also
He went forth, or out, (Mgh, TA,) to the outside
of a place. (O, TA.) ―
-b3-  And He (a bird)
migrated, or went down, from one country or
region to another: used in this sense by AHn in
relation to the vulture, migrating to Nejd. (L.)
―
-b4-  ظَهَرَ عَنْهُ, said of a vice, or fault, (O, TA,) or
a disgrace, (JK, A, O,) (tropical:)  It did not cleave to
him; (A, O, TA;) it was remote from him;
(TA;) it quitted him, or departed from him.
(JK.) ―
-b5-  ظَهَرْتُ بِهِ, (O, TA,) inf. n. ظَهْرٌ, (K,)
(assumed tropical:)  I gloried, or boasted, by reason of it. (O, K *
TA.) [Respecting a meaning assigned to ظَهَرَ
بِفُلَانٍ in the K, see 4.] ―
-b6-  أَكَلَ الرَّجُلُ أُكْلَةً
ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا ظَهْرَةً means (assumed tropical:)  [The man ate some food]
in consequence of which] he became fat. (TA.)
-A2-  ظَهَرَهُ He mounted it; went, or got, upon it,
or upon the top of it; (S, A, * Mgh, O, Msb, K;)
as also ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ; (O;) namely, a house, (S,)
or a house-top, (A, Mgh, O,) and a mountain,
(A,) and a wall; (O, Msb;) properly, he became
upon its back: (Mgh:) and [in like manner] one
says, فُلَانٌ نَجْدًا ↓ ظَهَّرَ, inf. n. تَظْهِيرٌ, Such a one
mounted, or went up, upon the high region (ظَهْر)
of Nejd. (O.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (Mgh, Msb,) ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and بِهِ, (K,) inf. n. ظُهُورٌ
(Bd in xxiv. 31) and ظَهْرٌ also, (Ham p. 301,)
He overcame, conquered, subdued, overpowered, or
mastered, him; gained the mastery or victory, or
prevailed, over him; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;)
namely, his enemy; (Msb;) and in like manner,
[he conquered, won, achieved, or attained, it, i. e.]
a thing. (O, TA.) [The saying فُلَانٌ لَا يَظْهَرُ
عَلَيْهِ أَحَدٌ is expl. in the L and TA by the words
اى لا يَسْلَم, and said to be tropical: but Ibr D
thinks that the correct reading is لا يُسَلِّمُ, from
التَّسْلِيمُ; and that it is said of one who will not
give up, or resign, what is in his hand; so that
the meaning is, (tropical:)  Such a one is a person whom no
one will overcome in respect of that which he holds
in his possession.] ―
-b3-  And [hence also] ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ,
(Msb, TA,) inf. n. ظُهُورٌ, (TA,) He knew, became
acquainted with, or got knowledge of, him, or
it. (Msb, TA.) So in the Kur xxiv. 31, وَالطِّفْلُ
الَّذِينَ لَمْ يَظْهَرُوا عَلَى عَوْرَاتِ النِّسَآءِ [And the young
children] who have not attained knowledge of the
عورات, (Bd, Jel,) meaning [pudenda, or] parts
between the navel and the knee, (Jel,) of women,
by reason of their want of discrimination: (Bd:)
or (tropical:)  who have not attained to the generative
faculty; (O, Bd, * TA;) from الظُّهُورُ in the sense
of الغَلَبَةُ. (Bd.) So too in the Kur [xviii. 19],
إِنْ يَظْهَرُوا عَلَيْكُمْ If they get knowledge of you.
(O, TA.) ―
-b4-  And [hence] ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ, (Fr, A, O,
TA,) and ↓ استظهرهُ, (S, A, O, K,) (tropical:)  He knew it,
or learned it, by heart; namely, the Kur-án;
(A, O, TA;) and he recited it by heart: (A, *
TA; and so in the S and O in explanation of the
latter:) or [simply] he recited it by heart; namely,
the Kur-án; as also ↓ اظهرهُ: (O, K, TA:) in
the copies of the K we find أَظْهَرْتُ عَلَى القُرْآنِ and
أَظْهَرْتُهُ; but the former is a mistake for ظَهَرْتُ,
aor.
ظَهَرَ. (TA.)
-A3-  For another signification of
ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ, see 3.
-A4-  ظَهَرَ بِحَاجَتِى, (S, A, K,)
aor.
ظَهَرَ, (TA,) inf. n. ظَهْرٌ; (TK;) and ↓ ظهّرها,
(K, TA,) in some copies of the K ظَهَرَهَا; (TA;)
and ↓ اظهرها, (K,) inf. n. إِظْهَارٌ; (TA;) and
↓ اِظَّهَرَهَا, (K,) of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ; (TA;)
(tropical:)  He held the object of my want in little, or light,
estimation, or in contempt; (S, A;) [lit.] he put
it behind [his] back; (S, K;) as though he put it
away, [out of his sight,] and paid no regard to it.
(S, TA.) One says also, يَظْهَرُونَ بِهِمْ وَلَا يَلْتَفِتُونَ
إِلَى أَرْحَامِهِمْ [They hold them in contempt, and
do not pay any regard to their ties of relationship]. (S.) ―
-b2-  See also 10, in three places.
-A5-
ظَهَرَهُ, (O, K,) aor.
ظَهَرَ, inf. n. ظَهْرٌ, (K,) He struck,
or smote, (TA,) or hit, or hurt, (O, K,) his back.
(O, K, TA.)
-A6-  ظَهِرَ, (S, O, K,) aor.
ظَهَرَ, (K,)
inf. n. ظَهَرٌ, (O, K,) He (a man, S, O) had a
complaint of his back. (S, O, K.)
-A7-  ظَهُرَ, (JK,
O, L,) or ظَهَرَ, (K, [but this is app. a mistranscription,]) inf. n. ظَهَارَةٌ, (S, O, L, K,) said of a
camel, (JK, S, O,) He was, or became, strong
(JK, S, O, L, K) in the back. (L, K.)

ظَهَّرَ see 1, near the middle: ―
-b2-  and again, in
the last quarter: ―
-b3-  and see also 3. ―
-b4-  ظهّر الثَّوْبَ
[and ↓ اظهرهُ, contr. of بطّنهُ and ابطنهُ,] He faced
the garment, or piece of cloth; put a facing, or
an outer covering, (ظِهَارَة,) to it. (TA.)
-A2-  See
also 4, last sentence.
3
ظاهرهُ, (A,) inf. n. مُظَاهَرَةٌ, (S, O, Msb,) He
aided, or assisted, him; (S, A, O, Msb;) as also
عَلَيْهِ ↓ ظَهَرَ. (Th, K.) And ظاهر عَلَيْهِ He aided,
or assisted, against him. (TA.) ―
-b2-  ظاهر بِهِ: see
10. ―
-b3-  ظاهر بَيْنَهُمَا, (K,) i. e. (TA) بَيْنَ ثَوْبَيْنِ,
(S, A, Mgh, TA,) and دِرْعَيْنِ, (A, Mgh, TA,)
and نَعْلَيْنِ, (TA,) i. q. طَارَقَ بَيْنَهُمَا, (S, TA,) or
طَابَقَ, (A, K, TA,) i. e. (TA) He put them on,
or attired himself with them, [namely, two garments, and two coats of mail, and two sandals
or soles, or rather, when relating to two soles,
he sewed them together,] one over, or outside, the
other: (Mgh, TA:) app. from تَظَاهُرٌ in the sense
of “ mutual aiding or assisting. ” (IAth.) The
phrase ظاهر بِدِرْعَيْنِ requires consideration; and
the ب in it should be regarded as meant to denote
conjunction; not as a part of the necessary complement of the verb. (Mgh.) ظاهر الدِّرْعَ is said
to signify لَأَمَ بَعْضَهَا عَلَى بَعْضٍ [app. meaning
He folded over and fastened one part of the coat
of mail upon another]. (TA.) And ظاهر عَلَيْهِ
جِلَالًا means He threw upon him (i. e. a horse)
housings or coverings [one over another]. (TA
in art. حنذ.)
-A2-  ظاهر مِنِ امْرَأَتِهِ, (S, Mgh, O,
Msb, K,) inf. n. ظِهَارٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and
مُظَاهَرَةٌ; (JK, TA;) and مِنْهَا ↓ تظاهر, (A, Mgh,
O, TA,) and ↓ اِظَّاهَرَ; (Mgh;) and منها ↓ تظهّر,
(S, Msb, K,) and ↓ اِظَّهَّرَ; (O, TA;) and منها ↓ ظهّر,
(S, O, K,) inf. n. تَظْهِيرٌ; (S;) signify the same;
(O;) He said to his wife أَنْتِ عَلَىَّ كَظَهْرِ أُمِّى
[Thou art to me like the back of my mother];
(S, Mgh, Msb, K;) [as though he said رُكُوبُكِ
حَرَامٌ عَلَىَّ;] meaning رُكُوبُكِ لِلنِّكَاحِ حَرَامٌ عَلَىَّ
كَرُكُوبِ أُمِّى لِلنِّكَاحِ; the back being specified
in preference to the بَطْن or فَخِذ or فَرْج because
the woman is likened to a beast that is ridden,
and the act of نِكَاح to that of رُكُوب: the phrase
being a form of divorce used by the Arabs in the
Time of Ignorance. (Msb, * TA.) In the Kur
lviii. 2 [and 4], some read ↓ يَظَّهَّرُونَ; some
↓ يَظَّاهَرُونَ; and 'Ásim read يُظَاهِرُونَ. (Bd.)
The verb is made trans. by means of مِن because
the man who uttered this sentence estranged himself from his wife. (IAth.)
4
اظهرهُ He made it apparent, overt, open,
perceptible or perceived, manifest, plain, or evident;
he showed, exhibited, manifested, displayed, discovered, revealed, or evinced, it; or put it forth:
(S, O, K:) [it is also used in relation to a saying,
and an action, and the like, as meaning it showed,
&c., as above, or it bespoke, it:] and Mtr relates
his having heard from one worthy of reliance of
the people of Baghdád, that they say ↓ تظاهرتُ
بِهِ in the place of أَظْهَرْتُهُ, and scarcely ever employ اظهر in its usual sense. (Har p. 85.)
[Hence, اظهر التَّضْعِيفَ He made the doubling of
a letter distinct; as in لَحِحَتْ; which, accord.
to a general rule, should be لَحَّتْ: opposed to
أَدْغَمَ. And اظهر لَهُ كَذَا He showed, &c., to him
such a thing: and he made a show of, professed,
pretended, or feigned, to him such a thing: as, for
instance, love.] ―
-b2-  أَظْهَرْتُ بِفُلَانٍ means أَعْلَيْتُ بِهِ
[a phrase which I have not found except in this
instance, app. I elevated, or exalted, such a one:
like أَعْلَيْتُهُ, which has this meaning]: (S, IKtt,
L, TA:) or أَعْلَنْتُ بِهِ [app. meaning I made
such a one to be, or become, publicly known]: (So
in the O:) [but the former explanation seems to
be regarded by SM as the right; for he remarks
that,] accord. to all the copies of the K, the explanation is أَعْلَنَ بِهِ, and refers to ظَهَرَ بِفُلَانٍ
[instead of أَظْهَرَ]; so that what its author says
in this case differs in two points of view from
what is found in the “ Kitáb el-Abniyeh ” of
IKtt, in which the ى in أَعْلَيْتُ has been marked
as correct, and in the L [as well as in the S].
(TA.)
-A2-  اظهرهُ اللّٰهُ عَلَى عَدُوِّهِ means God made
him to overcome, conquer, subdue, overpower,
master, gain the victory over, or prevail over, his
enemy. (S, A, O, TA.) ―
-b2-  And [hence] اظهرهُ
عَلَيْهِ He (God) made him to know it, or become
acquainted with it: you say, أَظْهَرَنِى اللّٰهُ عَلَى مَا
سُرِقَ مِنِّى God made me to know [or discover]
what had been stolen from me. (TA.)
-A3-  See
also 1, last quarter, in two places.
-A4-  And see 2.
-A5-  اظهر signifies also He entered upon the time
called the ظَهِيرَة: (A, Msb, K:) or the time called
the ظُهْر. (Msb.) And He went, or journeyed,
in the time called the ظَهِيرَة; as also ↓ ظهّر, (K,)
inf. n. تَظْهِيرٌ: (TA:) or the time called the ظُهْر.
(S, O.)

تظهّر and
اِظَّهَّرَ: see 3, latter half, in three
places.
6
تَظَاْهَرَ see 1, first sentence: ―
-b2-  and see also 4, first
sentence. ―
-b3-  تظاهروا They aided, or assisted, one
another. (S, O, * K.) And تظاهروا عَلَى فُلَانٍ
They leagued together, and aided one another,
against such a one. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA in art.
ضفر.) ―
-b4-  Also They regarded, or treated, one
another with enmity, or hostility; or severed
themselves, one from another: (S, Msb, K:) as
though they turned their backs, one upon another:
(S:) or, because they who do so turn their backs,
one upon another. (Msb.) Thus the verb has
two contr. meanings. (K.) ―
-b5-  تظاهر مِنِ امْرَأَتِهِ
and اِظَّاهَرَ: see 3, latter half, in three places.
8
اِظَّهَرَ: see 1, last quarter.
10
استظهر بِهِ He sought aid, or assistance, in,
or by means of, him, or it, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,)
عَلَيْهِ [against him, or it]; as also استظهرهُ. (TA.)
[In the CK, after the explanation of استظهر به,
is an omission, to be supplied by the insertion of
وَقَرَأَهُ.] One says, استظهر بِالْغِنَى عَلَى النَّوَائِبِ
[He sought aid in wealth against calamities, or
afflictions]. (Msb.) And بِهِ ↓ ظاهر signifies the
same as استظهر [in this sense or in another of the
senses expl. in what follows]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
استظهرتُ بِالشَّىْءِ, and بِهِ ↓ ظَهَرْتُ, and ↓ ظَهَرْتُهُ,
I put the thing behind my back for protection, or
security. (Har p. 265.) ―
-b3-  And استظهر He prepared for himself a camel, or two camels, or
more, for future need: (T:) and استظهرهُ, and
بِهِ ↓ ظَهَرَ, He prepared him, namely, a camel,
for future need: (K:) and استظهر بِبَعِيرَيْنِ
ظِهْرِيَّيْنِ He prepared for himself two camels for
future need. (T. [See ظِهْرِىٌّ.]) ―
-b4-  Hence, (T,)
استظهر signifies also He used precaution (T,
Msb) with respect to anything: (T:) he secured
himself, (اِسْتَوْثَقَ,) by using precaution; as, for
instance, a woman does by remaining three days,
before she performs the ablution termed غُسْل,
and prays, after the usual period of the menses.
(T, L.) One says, يُسْتَحَبُّ الاِسْتِظْهَارُ بِغَسْلَةٍ ثَانِيَةٍ
وَثَالِثَةٍ The using precaution by a second and a
third washing, to make sure of being pure, is
approved. (Er-Ráfi'ee, Msb.) And استظهرتُ
فِى طَلَبِ الشَّىْءِ I adopted the most fit, or proper,
way, and used precaution, in seeking to attain
the thing. (Msb.) ―
-b5-  See also 1, in the middle
of the latter half.
ظَهْرٌ The back; contr. of بَطْنٌ: (S, A, O, Msb,
K:) in a man, from the hinder part of the كَاهِل
[or base of the neck] to the nearest part of the
buttocks, where it terminates: (TA:) in a camel,
the part containing six vertebræ on the right and
left of which are [two portions of flesh and sinew
called the] مَتْنَانِ: (AHeyth, T, O:) of the masc.
gender: (Lh, A, K:) pl. [of pauc.] أَظْهُرٌ, and [of
mult.] ظُهُورٌ and ظُهْرَانٌ. (Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  رَجُلٌ
خَفِيفُ الظَّهْرِ (tropical:)  A man having a small household to
maintain: and ثَقِيلُ الظَّهْرِ (tropical:)  having a large household to maintain. (K, * TA.) ―
-b3-  أَنْت عَلَىَّ كَظَهْرِ
أُمِّى Thou art to me like the back of my mother:
said by a man to his wife. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.)
[This has been expl. above: see 3.] ―
-b4-  عَدَا فِى
ظَهْرِهِ (tropical:)  He stole what was behind him: (A:) [or
he acted wrongfully in respect of what was behind
him: for] لِصٌّ عَادِى ظَهْرٍ is expl. by the words
عَدَا فِى ظَهْرٍ فَسَرَقَهُ [so that it app. means (tropical:)  A
thief who has acted wrongfully in respect of
what was behind one, and stolen it]. (O, K.) ―
-b5-
أَقْرَانُ الظَّهْرِ (S, O, K) and الظُّهُورِ (O, TA)
Adversaries who come to one from behind his
back, in war, or fight. (S, O, K, * TA.) In the
copies of the K, يُحِبُّونَكَ is erroneously put for
يَجِيؤُونَكَ. (TA.) You say also, فُلَانٌ قِرْنُ الظَّهْرِ
Such a one is an adversary who comes to one
from behind, unknown. (IAar, As.) ―
-b6-  قَتَلَهُ ظَهْرًا
He slew him unexpectedly; he assassinated him;
syn. غِيلَةٌ. (IAar, TA.) ―
-b7-  جَعَلَنِى بِظَهْرٍ (tropical:)  He
cast me off. (TA.) And جَعَلتُ حَاجَتَهُ بِظَهْرٍ
(tropical:)  I cast his want behind my back: (AO, K:)
and ↓ جَعَلَهَا ظِهْرِيَّةً signifies the same: (S:) and
↓ اِتَّخَذَهَا ظِهْرِيًّا, (K,) and ↓ ظِهْرِيَّةً: (TA:) or
the former of the last two phrases signifies he
held it in contempt; as though ظهريّا were an
irreg. rel. n. from ظَهْرٌ: (TA:) or ↓ اِتَّخَذَهُ ظِهْرِيًّا
signifies he neglected, or forgot, (S, O, * Msb,)
him, as in the Kur xi. 94, (S, O,) or it, namely,
what was said. (Msb.) And لَا تَجْعَلْ حَاجَتِى
بِظَهْرٍ (tropical:)  Forget not thou, or neglect not, my want:
(S:) and ↓ جَعَلَهُ ظِهْرِيًّا signifies he forgot it; as
well as جعله بِظَهْرٍ. (A.) And جَعَلْتُ هٰذَا الأَمْرَ
بِظَهْرٍ, and رَمَيْتُهُ بِظَهْرٍ, (tropical:)  I cared not for this thing.
(Th, O.) ―
-b8-  فُلَانٌ مِنْ وَلَدِ الظَّهْرِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is
of those who do not belong to us: or of those to
whom no regard is paid: (TA:) or of those who
are held in contempt, and to whose ties of
relationship no regard is paid. (S, TA.) ―
-b9-
هُوَ ابْنُ عَمِّهِ ظَهْرًا (tropical:)  [He is his cousin on the
father's side,] distantly related: contr. of دِنْيًا
[and لَحًّا]. (As, A, O, TA.) ―
-b10-  رَجَعَ عَلَى ظَهْرِهِ
[He receded, retired, or retreated]. (K in art.
ثبجر.) ―
-b11-  هُوَ نَازِلٌ بَيْنَ ظَهْرَيْهِمْ, and ↓ بين ظَهْرَانَيْهِمْ,
(S, A, O, Msb, K, *) in which latter the ا and ن
are said by some to be added for corroboration,
(Msb,) and for which one should not say
ظَهْرَانِيهِمْ, (IF, S, O, Msb, K,) and بين أَظْهُرِهِمْ,
(Msb, K,) (tropical:)  He is making his abode in the
midst of them; in the main body of them: (K,
TA:) originally meaning he is making his abode
among them for the purpose of seeking aid of
them and staying himself upon them: as though
it meant that the back of one of them was before
him, and that of another behind him, so that he
was defended in either direction: afterwards, by
reason of frequency of usage, it came to be
employed to signify abiding among a people
absolutely. (IAth, Msb.) You say also هُوَ بَيْنَ
ظَهْرَيْهِ, and ↓ بَيْنَ ظَهْرَانَيْهِ, meaning It (anything)
is in the midst, or main part, of it, namely,
another thing. (TA.) ―
-b12-  لَقِيتُهُ بَيْنَ الظَّهْرَيْنِ, and
↓ بَيْنَ الظَّهْرَانَيْنِ, (S, O, Msb, K,) (tropical:)  I met him
during the day, (Msb,) or during the two days,
(S, O, K,) or during the three days, (K,) or the
days: (S, O, Msb:) from the next preceding
phrase. (TA.) And أَتَيْتُهُ مَرَّةً بَيْنَ الظَّهَرْينِ (tropical:)  I
came to him one day: or, accord. to Aboo-Fak'as, on a day between two years. (Fr.)
And اللَّيْلِ ↓ رَأَيْتُهُ بَيْنَ ظَهْرَانَىِ (tropical:)  I saw him between nightfall and daybreak. (TA.) And
النَّهَارِ ↓ جِئْتُهُ بَيْنَ ظَهْرَانَىِ (tropical:)  [I came to him between the beginning and end of the day]. (A.)
―
-b13-  تَقَلَّبَ ظَهْرًا لِبَطْنٍ (assumed tropical:)  It turned over and over,
or upside down, (lit. back for belly,) as a serpent
does upon ground heated by the sun. (S and TA
in art. قلب.) [Hence,] قَلَبْتُ الأَرْضَ ظَهْرًا لِبَطْنٍ
(tropical:)  [I turned the earth over, upside-down]. (A.)
And [hence,] قَلَّبَ أَمْرَهُ ظَهْرًا لِبَطْنٍ, (O, * TA,)
and ظَهْرَهُ لِبَطْنٍ, and ظَهْرَهُ لِبَطْنِهِ, and ظَهْرَهُ لِلْبَطْنِ,
which last form is preferred by El-Farezdak to
the second, because [as in the third form] the
second of the two words is determinate like the
first word, (tropical:)  He meditated, or managed, the
affair with forecast, and well. (O, * TA.) ―
-b14-  The
Arabs used to say, هٰذَا ظَهْرُ السَّمَآءِ and هذا بَطْنُ
السَّمَآءِ, both meaning (tropical:)  This is the apparent,
visible, part of the sky. (Fr, Az.) And the like
is said of the side of a wall, which is its بَطْن to
a person on the same side, and its ظَهْر to one on
the other side. (Az.) ―
-b15-  مَا نَزَلَ مِنَ القُرْآنِ آيَةٌ إِلَّا
لَهَا ظَهْرٌ وَبَطْنٌ, [part of] a saying of Mohammad,
[of which see the rest voce مُطَّلَعٌ,] means (assumed tropical:)  Not
a verse of the Kur-án has come down but it has a
verbal expression and an interpretation: (K, *
TA:) or a verbal expression and a meaning: or
that which has an apparent and a known [or an
exoteric] interpretation and that which has an
intrinsic [or esoteric] interpretation: (TA:) or
narration (K, TA) and admonition: (TA:) or
[it is to be read and to be understood and taught;
for] by the ظهر is meant the reading; and by the
بطن, the understanding and teaching. (TA.)
[See also بَطْنٌ.] ―
-b16-  ظَهْرٌ signifies also (tropical:)  Camels on
which people ride, and which carry goods; (S, *
A, * O, K, * TA;) camels that carry burdens upon
their backs in journeying: (TA:) [or] a beast:
or a camel for riding: (Mgh:) pl. ظُهْرَانٌ.
(TA.) It is said in a trad. of 'Arfajeh, فَتَنَاوَلَ
السَّيْفَ مِنَ الظَّهْرِ And he reached, or took in his
hand, the sword from the camels for carrying
burdens and for riding: and in another, أَتَأْذَنُ
لَنَا فِى نَحْرِ ظَهْرِنَا Dost thou permit us to slaughter
our camels which we ride? (TA.) And one
says also, هُوَ عَلَى ظَهْرٍ (tropical:)  He is determined upon
travel: (K:) as though he had already mounted
a beast for that purpose. (TA.) ―
-b17-  [Hence,
app.,] (assumed tropical:)  Property consisting of camels and sheep
or goats: (TA:) or much property. (K, TA.)
―
-b18-  (assumed tropical:)  The short side [or lateral half] of a
feather: (S, O, K:) pl. ظُهْرَانٌ: (S, M, K, TA,
&c.:) opposed to بَطْنٌ, sing. of بُطْنَانٌ, (TA,)
which latter signifies the “ long sides: ” (S, TA:)
and ↓ ظُهَارٌ signifies the same as ظَهْرٌ, (K,) or the
same as ظُهْرَانٌ, being an irregular pl.; and this
is meant by the saying الظُّهَارُ بِالضَّمِ الجَمَاعَةُ,
mentioned in a later place in the K [in such a
manner as to have led to the supposition that
ظُهَارٌ is also syn. with جَمَاعَةٌ]: (TA:) AO says
that among the feathers of arrows are the ظُهَار,
which are those that are put [upon an arrow] of
the ظَهْر [or outer side] of the عَسِيب [app. here
meaning the shaft] of the feather; (S, TA;)
i. e., the shorter side, which is the best kind of
feather; as also ظُهْرَان: sing. ظَهْرٌ: (TA:) ISd
says that the ظُهْرَان are those parts of the feathers
of the wing that are exposed to the sun and rain:
(TA:) Lth says that the ظُهَار are those parts of
the feathers of the wing that are apparent. (O,
TA.) One says, رِشْ سَهْمَكَ بِظُهْرَانٍ وَلَا تَرِشْهُ بِبُطْنَانٍ
[Feather thine arrow with short sides of feathers,
and feather it not with long sides of feathers].
(S, TA.) [De Sacy supposes that ظُهُورٌ and
بُطُونٌ are also pls. of ظَهْرٌ and بَطْنٌ thus used:
(see his “ Chrest. Arabe,” sec. ed., tome ii., p.
374:) but his reasons do not appear to me to be
conclusive.] ↓ ظُهَارٌ and ظُهْرَانٌ are also used as
epithets: you say, رِيشٌ ظُهَارٌ and رِيشٌ ظُهْرَانٌ.
(TA.) ―
-b19-  [ظَهْرُ الكَفِّ and ↓ ظَاهِرُهَا mean (assumed tropical:)  The

and ↓ ظَاهِرُهَا mean (assumed tropical:)  The upper, or convex, side,

to بَطْن and بَاطِن. And ظَهْرُ اللِّسَانِ means (assumed tropical:)  The
upper surface of the tongue.] ―
-b20-  And ظَهْرٌ also
signifies (tropical:)  A way by land. (S, M, O, Msb, K.)
This expression is used when there is a way by

فِى طَرِيقِ الظَّهْرِ (tropical:)  They journeyed by land. (A.)
―
-b21-  And (assumed tropical:)  An elevated tract of land or ground;
as also ↓ ظَاهِرةٌ: (A:) or rugged and elevated

and plain and fine and low land or ground: ”
(TA:) and ↓ ظَوَاهِرُ [pl. of. ظَاهِرَةٌ] signifies
(assumed tropical:)  elevated tracts of land or ground: (S, K:) you
say, هَاجَتْ ظَوَاهِرُ الأَرْضِ, meaning, (assumed tropical:)  the herbs,
or leguminous plants, of the elevated tracts of
land, or ground, dried up: (As, S, L:) and
↓ ظَاهِرٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  the higher, or highest, part of a
mountain; (ISh, L, TA;) whether its exterior be
plain or not: (TA:) and ↓ ظَاهِرَةٌ, the same, of
anything: (L:) when you have ascended upon
the ظَهْر of a mountain, you are upon its ظَاهِرَة.
(TA.) ―
-b22-  سَالَ وَادِيهِمْ ظَهْرًا means (assumed tropical:)  Their valley
flowed with the rain of their own land: opposed
to دُرْءًا, meaning, “from other rain: ” (IAar, O,
K: *) or the former signifies their valley flowed
with its own rain: and the latter, “with other
than its own rain: ” (TA:) and some say
↓ ظُهْرًا, which Az thinks the better form. (O,
TA.) ―
-b23-  [Hence, probably,] أَصَبْتُ مِنْهُ مَطَرَ ظَهْرٍ
(assumed tropical:)  I obtained from him, or it, much good. (Sgh,
O, K.) ―
-b24-  And another signification of ظَهْرٌ is
What is absent, or hidden, or concealed, from one.
(O, K.) ―
-b25-  It is sometimes prefixed to another
noun to give plainness and force to the expression; as in ظَهْرُ الغَيْبِ and ظَهْرُ القَلْبِ, meaning
نَفْسُ الغَيْبِ and نَفْسُ القَلْبِ: (Msb:) or it is
redundant in these instances. (Mgh.) Lebeed
says, describing a [wild] cow going about after a
beast of prey that had eaten her young one,
وَتَسَمَّعَتْ رِزَّ الأَنِيسِ فَرَاعَهَا
عَنْ ظَهْرِ غَيْبٍ وَالأَنِيسُ سَقَامُهَا
[And she heard the sound of man, and it frightened her, from a place that concealed what was in
it; for man is her malady; i. e., a cause of pain
and trouble and death to her]: (TA:) meaning,
she heard the sound of the hunters, &c. (TA in
art. غيب.) And you say, تَنَاوَلَهُ بِظَهْرِ الغَيْبِ بِمَا
يَسُوؤُهُ He carped at him behind the back, or in
absence, by saying what would grieve him. (TA
in art. غيب.) And تَكَلَّمْتُ بِهِ عَنْ ظَهْرِ الغَيْبِ
(A, O) or عن ظَهْرِ غَيْبٍ (TA) [app., (tropical:)  I spoke it
by memory; in the absence of a book or the like;
as one says in modern Arabic, عَلَى الغَائِب. See
also غَيْبٌ.] And قَرَأَهُ عَنْ ظَهْرِ القَلْبِ (tropical:)  He recited
it by heart, or memory; without book: (L, K:
[in the latter, مِنْ is put in the place of عَنْ; but
the right reading is that in the L: and in the CK
is an omission here, to be supplied by the insertion of وَقَرَأَهُ:]) and ↓ قرأه ظَاهِرًا and قرأه عَلَى
ظَهْرِ لِسَانِهِ [signify the same]. (K.) And حَمَلَ
القُرْآنَ عَلَى ظَهْرِ لِسَانِهِ like حَفِظَهُ عَلَى ظَهْرِ قَلْبِهِ
(tropical:)  [He knew the Kur-án by heart]. (A, * O, TA.)
―
-b26-  One says also, فُلَانٌ يَأْكُلُ عَلَى ظَهْرِ يَدِ فُلَانٍ
(tropical:)  Such a one eats at the expense of such a one.
(A, O, K. *) And in like manner, الفُقَرَآءُ يَأْكُلُونَ

ظَهْرِ يَدٍ (tropical:)  He gave him originally; without compensation. (O, * K; but in some copies of the K
we find مِنْ in the place of عَنْ.) It is said [in a
trad.], أَفْضَلُ الصَّدَقَةِ مَا كَانَ عَنْ ظَهْرِ غِنًى (tropical:)  The
most excellent of alms is that which is [derived]
from competence; ظهر: (Msb:) or
simply عَنْ غِنًى, the word ظهر being here redundant: (Mgh:) or from manifest competence upon
which one relies, and in which he seeks aid against
calamities, or afflictions: or from what remains
after fight: (Msb:) or from superfluous property.
(TA.)
-A2-  See also ظَهِيرٌ
-A3-  قِدْرُ ظَهْرٍ means (assumed tropical:)  An

ظُهْرٌ Midday, or noon: (IAth, TA:) or the
time when the sun declines from the meridian:
(Msb, * K, * O, * TA:) or [the time immediately]
after the declining of the sun: (S, Mgh:) masc.
and fem.; unless when the word صَلَاة is prefixed
to it, in which case it is fem. only: (Msb:) [pl.
أَظْهَارٌ. See also ظَهِيرَةٌ.] صَلَاةُ الظُّهْرِ means The
prayer [i. e. the divinely-ordained prayer] of midday, or noon: (IAth, TA:) or of the time after
the declining of the sun. (S, O.) In the phrases
أَبْرِدُوا بِالظُّهْرِ [Defer ye the prayer of midday until
the cooler time of day] and صَلَّى الظُّهْرَ [He performed the prayer of midday], the prefixed
noun (صَلَاة) is suppressed. (Mgh.)

ظِهْرِىٌّ A camel prepared for future need; (T,
S, O, K;) taken, by way of precaution, to bear
the burden of any camel that may happen to fail
in a journey: sometimes two or more unladen
camels are taken for this purpose: some say that
such a camel is thus called because its owner
puts it behind his back, not riding it nor putting
any burden upon it: (T, TA:) the word appears
to be an irreg. rel. n. from ظَهْرٌ: (ISd, TA:) pl.
ظَهَارِىٌّ, imperfectly decl., because the rel. ى
retains its place in the sing. [inseparably; there
being no such word as ظِهْر: but if it be a rel. n.,
this pl. is irreg., like مَهَارِىٌّ]. (S, O, K.) ―

Lord]. (Ibn-'Arafeh.) You say also, فُلَانٌ

[lxvi. 4], وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ ظَهِيرٌ [And the angels
after that will be his aiders]: and instance of
ظهير in a pl. sense: (S, O, Msb:) for words of
the measures فَعُولٌ and فَعِيلٌ are sometimes masc.
and fem. [and sing.] and pl. (S.) You also say,
