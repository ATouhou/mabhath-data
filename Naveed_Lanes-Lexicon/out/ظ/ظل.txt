ظل1
ظَلَّ, aor. يَظِلُّ, inf. n. ظِلَالَةٌ: see 4.
-A2-  ظَلَّ,
(T, M, Msb, K,) first pers. ظَلِلْتُ, (T, S, M, O,
Msb, K,) [and accord. to SM ظَلَلْتُ also, for
he says that] the verb is of the class of مَنَعَ as
well as of the class of تَعِبَ, (TA,) and ظَلْتُ,
(T, S, * M, O, K,) likened to لَسْتُ, (M, K, *)
formed by rejecting the former ل in ظَلِلْتُ,
(T, O,) and ظِلْتُ, which is [also] originally
ظَلِلْتُ, (Sb, T, M, O, K,) formed by transferring
to the ظ the vowel of the rejected ل, (Sb, T, M,
O,) anomalously, (Sb, M,) the latter of the dial.
of the people of El-Hijáz; (T;) aor. يَظَلُّ; (S, *
M, O, * Msb, K;) imperative اِظْلَلْ and ظَلْ (T)
[and it is implied in the M voce قَرَّ that one says
also اِظْلِلْ and ظِلْ, which indicates that the aor.
is also يَظِلُّ, but this requires confirmation, which
I have not anywhere found]; inf. n. ظُلُولٌ (T,
S, M, O, Msb, K) and ظَلٌّ (M, K) and ظِلٌّ;
(thus also in a copy of the M; [but this I think
doubtful;]) accord. to Lth, (T,) or Kh, (Msb,)
[i. e. accord. to the author of the 'Eyn,] is said
only of a thing that is done in the day, or daytimes; (T, S, M, O, Msb;) like as بَاتَ, aor. يَبِيتُ,
is said only of a thing that is done in the night:
(T:) it is an incomplete [i. e. a non-attributive]
verb, relating to a time in which is a shade from
the sun, from morning to evening, or from sunrise to sunset: (Esh-Shiháb, TA:) one says, ظَلَّ
فُلَانٌ نَهَارَهُ صَائِمًا [Such a one was during his day
fasting; or he passed his day fasting]: (Lth, T:)
and ظَلَّ نَهَارَهُ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا [He was in, or during,
his day doing such a thing; or he passed his day
doing such a thing]: (M, K:) and ظَلِلْتُ أَعْمَلُ
كَذَا [I was in the day or daytime, or I passed
the day, doing such a thing; or] I did such a
thing in the day or daytime. (S, O, Msb. *) In
the saying of 'Antarah,
وَلَقَدْ أَبِيتُ عَلَى الطَّوَى وَأَظَلُّهُ
حَتَّى أَنَالَ بِهِ كَرِيمَ المَأْكَلِ
[app. meaning And verily I pass the night in
hunger, and I pass the day in it, that I may
attain thereby plentiful eating], أَظَلُّهُ is for أَظَلُّ
عَلَيْهِ. (S, O.) And accord. to some, (TA,) ظَلَّ
لَيْلَهُ occurs in poetry; (M, K, TA;) so that one
says, ظَلَّ لَيْلَهُ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا [He was in, or during,
his night, or he passed his night, doing such a
thing]: but it is said that in this case the verb
has the meaning next following. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
it signifies also He, or it, became; syn. صَارَ:
(Er-Rághib, TA:) being in this sense likewise
an incomplete [i. e. a non-attributive] verb,
divested of that meaning of time which it
radically denotes; as in the phrase in the Kur
[xvi. 60 and xliii. 16], ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدًّا [His
face becomes black]: so says Ibn-Málik: (TA:)
or this may mean his face continues all the day
black: (Bd in xvi. 60:) and one says also, ظَلَّ
يَفْعَلُ كَذَا meaning He continued doing such a
thing: this too is mentioned by Ibn-Málik, and
is of the dial. of the people of Syria. (TA.) ―
-b3-
It is also a complete [i. e. an attributive] verb as
meaning He, or it, continued; as is said in the
Expos. of the “ Shifè,” and by Ibn-Málik; and,
as Ibn-Málik likewise says, it was, or became,
long. (TA.)
2
ظللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ [He made it to give shade over
him, or it,] (M,) inf. n. تَظْلِيلٌ. (O.) It is said
in the Kur [vii. 160, and the like is said in ii. 54],
وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الغَمَامَ And we made the clouds to
give shade over them. (M.) ―
-b2-  [And ظللّٰهُ signifies He shaded him, or it. See an ex. in a
verse of Jereer in art. ردف, conj. 3.] لٰكِنْ عَلَى
الأَثَلَاتِ لَحْمٌ لَا يُظَلَّلُ [But at the tamarisk-trees
is flesh that will not be shaded, or, accord. to
the reading given by Meyd, بِالأَثَلَاتِ,] is a prov.,
said by Beyhes, in allusion to the flesh of his
slain brothers, on the occasion of persons saying,
ظَلِّلُوا لَحْمَ جَزُورِكُمْ [Shade ye the flesh of your
slaughtered camel]. (S, O.)
-A2-  See also 4.
-A3-
One says also ظلّل بِالسَّوْطِ, meaning He made
a sign with the whip for the purpose of frightening. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.)
4
اظلّ, said of a day, It was, (S, O,) or
became, (M, K,) shady, or a day having shade:
(S, M, O, K:) or it was a day having clouds, or
other [causes of shade]: (T:) or it was continually
shady; as also ↓ ظَلَّ, aor. يَظِلُّ, inf. n. ظِلَالَةٌ.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  And, said of a thing, [It extended its
shade; or] its shade extended; as also ↓ ظلّل.
(Msb.)
-A2-  أَظَلَّتْنِى الشَّجَرَةُ [The tree shaded me,
or afforded me shade]: and in like manner one
says of other things than trees. (S, O.) أَظَلَّكَ
said of a building, or of a mountain, or of a
cloud, means It protected thee, and cast its shade
upon thee. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] اظلّهُ (assumed tropical:)  He took
him into his shelter, or protection: (TA:) or he
guarded, or protected, him, and placed him within
the scope of his might, or power of resistance or
defence. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―
-b3-  And أَظَلَّنِى (assumed tropical:)  It
(a thing) covered me: (M, K:) or it approached
me, or drew near to me, so as to cast its shade
upon me: (K:) or it has both of these meanings:
(M:) or أَظَلَّكَ means he, (T, S,) or it, (O,)
approached thee, or drew near to thee, as though
he, or it, cast his, or its, shade upon thee. (T, S,
O.) And hence one says, أَظَلَّكَ أَمْرٌ (assumed tropical:)  An event
approached thee, or drew near to thee: (S, O:)
and in like manner one says of a month. (T, S,
O.) And اظلّ [alone] (assumed tropical:)  It (a thing) advanced:
or approached, or drew near. (Msb.) And i. q.
أَشْرَفَ [app. as meaning (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, became
within sight, or view]. (Msb.)
5
تَظَلَّ3َ see the next paragraph. It is also pronounced تَظَلَّى: (IAar, T:) and signifies He
kept to shady places, and to ease, or repose:
(IAar, T and K in art. ظلى:) it is like تَظَنَّيْتُ
from الظَّنُّ. (T in that art.)
10
استظلّ, (T,) or استظلّ بِالِظِّلِّ, (Msb, TA,)
He (a man, T) sheltered, or protected, himself by
means of the shade: (T, TA:) or the latter
means he inclined to the shade and sat in it.
(M, K.) And استظلّ مِنَ الشَّىْءِ and بِهِ means
↓ تَظَلَّلَ [i. e. he shaded himself (تظلّل being
quasi-pass. of ظَلَّلَهُ) from the thing and by means
of it]. (M, K.) You say, استظلّ بِهِ مِنَ الشَّمْسِ
[He shaded himself with it, or by means of it,
from the sun]. (T.) And استظلّ بِالشَّجَرَةِ He
shaded and sheltered himself by means of the tree.
(Ibn-'Abbád, S, O.) ―
-b2-  استظلّ الدَّمُ The blood
was in the جَوْف [or belly, or interior of the belly,
or the chest]. (T, O, K, TA. [In the CK, من
الجَوْفِ is put for فِى الجَوْفِ.]) ―
-b3-  استظلّت العَيْنُ,
(T, Ibn-'Abbád, O,) or العُيُونُ, (K,) The eye, (T,
Ibn-'Abbád, O,) meaning that of a she-camel,
(Ibn-'Abbád, O,) or the eyes, (K,) sank, or became depressed, in the head. (T, Ibn-'Abbád,
O, K.) ―
-b4-  And استظلّ الكَرْمُ The grape-vine
became luxuriant, or abundant and dense, in its
branches whereon were the bunches. (M, K.)
ظِلٌّ properly signifies Shade; i. e. the light of
the sun without the rays: when there is no light,
it is ظُلْمَةٌ, not ظِلٌّ: (S, O:) contr. of ضِحٌّ: (M,
K:) or i. q. فَىْءٌ: (K:) so some say: (M:) or
so the [common] people say: (IKt, Msb:) or
the former is [shade] in the morning; and the
latter is in the evening: (M, K:) or, accord.
to IKt, the former is in the morning and in the
evening; but the latter is only after the declining
of the sun from the meridian: ISk says that the
former is from the rising of the sun to its declining;
and the latter, from the declining to the setting:
Th says that the ظِلّ of a tree &c. is in the morning; and the فَىْء, in the evening: (Msb:) Ru-beh
says, (M, Msb,) any place, (M,) or any thing,
(Msb,) upon which the sun has been and which
it has quitted is termed ظِلٌّ and فَىْءٌ; (M, Msb;)
but a thing [or place] upon which the sun has not
been is termed ظِلٌّ [only]; and hence it is said
that the sun annuls, or supersedes, the ظِلّ, and
the فَىْء annuls, or supersedes, the sun: (Msb:)
AHeyth says, the ظِلّ is anything upon which the
sun has not come; and the term فَىْء is applied
only after the declining of the sun; the فَىْء
being eastwards and the ظِلّ being westwards;
and the ظِلّ being termed ظِلّ from the beginning
of the day to the declining of the sun; after which
it is termed فَىْء until the night: (T, TA:) one
says the ظِلّ of Paradise, but not its فَىْء, because
the sun will never replace its ظِلّ; but En-Nábighah
El-Jaadee has assigned to Paradise فَىْء having
ظِلَال: (M, TA:) in a verse of Aboo-Sakhr ElHudhalee, ظِلٌّ is made fem. as meaning مَنِيَّة [i. e.
death]: (Ham p. 161:) the pl. [of mult.] is ظِلَالٌ
(S, M, O, K) and ظُلُولٌ and [of pauc.] أَظْلَالٌ.
(M, O, K.) The saying of a rájiz,
كَأَنَّمَا وَجْهُكَ ظِلٌّ مِنْ حَجَرْ
[As though thy face were a shade of a stone] is
said to mean hardness of face, and shamelessness:
or the being black in the face: (T, TA:) for the
Arabs say that there is nothing more dense in
shade than a stone. (TA.) قَدْ ضَحَا ظِلُّهُ [His
shade, or shadow, has become sun] is said of the
dead. (TA.) مَرَّ بِنَا كَأَنَّهُ ظِلُّ ذِئْبٍ [He passed
by us as though he were the shadow of a wolf]
means swiftly, as does a wolf. (M.) اِنْتَعَلَتْ
ظِلَالَهَا (assumed tropical:)  [They made their shadows to be as
though they were sandals to them] is said of
camels or other beasts when it is midday in
summer and they have no shadow [but such as is
beneath them]: a rájiz says,
قَدْ وَرَدَتْ تَمْشِى عَلَى ظِلَالِهَا
وَذَابَتِ الشَّمْسُ عَلَى قِلَالِهَا
[They came to the water walking upon their
shadows, and the sun was intensely hot upon the
tops of their heads and humps]. (T.) And one
says, هُوَ يَتْبَعُ ظِلَّ نَفْسِهِ (tropical:)  [He follows the shadow
of himself; i. e. a thing that he will not overtake;
for], as a poet says, the shadow that goes with
thee thou wilt not overtake by following: and
هُوَ يُبَارِى ظِلَّ نَفْسِهِ (tropical:)  [He strives to outstrip the
shadow of himself], meaning that he walks with a
proud and self-conceited gait: so in the A.
(TA.) And اِنْتَقَلْتُ عَنْ ظِلِّى (tropical:)  I left my state,
or condition. (TA.) And تَرَكَ الظَّبْىُ ظِلَّهُ: so
in the T and S and O: (TA:) but [said to be]
correctly, أَتْرُكُهُ تَرْكَ الظَّبْىِ ظِلَّهُ, (K,) or لَأَتْرُكَنَّهُ,
(M, TA,) i. e. [I will forsake him, or I will
assuredly forsake him, as the gazelle forsakes] the
place of its shade: (O, TA:) [each, however,
is app. right; and the former is the more agreeable with the following explanations:] a prov.,
(M,) applied to the man who is wont to take
fright and flee; for the gazelle, when it takes
fright and flees from a thing, never returns to
it: (S, O, K:) by the ظِلّ is here meant the
covert in which it shades and shelters itself in the
vehemence of the heat; then the hunter comes to
it and rouses it, and it will not return thither;
and one says, تَرَكَ الظَّبْىُ ظِلَّهُ, meaning the place
of its shade: it is applied to him who takes fright
and flees from a thing, and forsakes it so as not
to return to it; and to the case of a man's forsaking his companion. (Meyd.) [ثَقِيلُ الظِّلِّ as
applied to a man, see expl. in art. ثقل: see
also Har p. 250, where it is indicated that it may
be rendered One whose shadow, even, is oppressive,
and therefore much more so is his person.] In the
phrase وَلَا الظِّلُّ وَلَا الْحَرُورُ, (M, K) in the Kur
[xxxv. 20], Th says, accord. to some, (M,) الظِّلُّ
means Paradise; (M, K;) and الحَرُورُ, the fire
[of Hell]: but he adds, I say that الظِّلُّ is the ظِلّ
itself [i. e. shade], and الحَرُورُ is the حَرّ itself [i. e.
heat]: (M: [see also حَرُورٌ:]) and Er-Rághib
says that ظِلٌّ is sometimes assigned to anything;
whether it be approved, as in the phrase above
mentioned; or disapproved, as in وَظِلٍّ مِنْ يَحْمُومٍ
in the Kur [lvi. 42, meaning And shade of smoke,
or black smoke]. (TA.) And الظِّلَالُ means
ظِلَالُ الجَنَّةِ [The shades of Paradise]: (Fr, T,
O, K, TA:) in some copies of the K, وَالظِّلَالُ
الجَنَّةُ, which is a mistake: (TA:) [but this
requires consideration; for] El-'Abbás Ibn-
'Abd-El-Muttalib says,
مِنْ قَبْلِهَا طِبْتَ فِى الظِّلَالِ وَفِى
مُسْتَوْدَعٍ حَيْثُ يُخْصَفُ الوَرَقُ
[Before it t?? wast good in, or in the shades of,
Paradise, and in a depositary in the part where
leaves are sewed together to conceal the pudenda];
(T, O, TA;) i. e. before thy descent to the earth
(to which the pronoun in قبلها relates), thou wast
good in the loins of Adam when he was in
Paradise. (TA.) الجَنَّةُ تَحْتَ ظِلَالِ السُّيُوفِ
[Paradise is beneath the shades of the swords] is a
trad., meaning that fighting against unbelievers
is a way of attaining to Paradise. (Marg. note
in a copy of the “ Jámi' es-Sagheer.) مُلَاعِبُ ظِلِّهِ
is an appellation of A certain bird; [see art.
لعب;] and one says مُلَاعِبَا ظِلِّهِمَا; and مُلَاعِبَاتُ
ظِلِّهِنَّ: but when you make them indeterminate,
you say مُلَاعِبَاتُ أَظْلَالِهِنَّ. (T, O, K. [But in
the TA in art. لعب, it is said that one dualizes
and pluralizes both nouns, because the appellation
becomes determinate.]) ―
-b2-  ظِلُّ اللَّيْلِ means
(tropical:)  The blackness of the night: (T, S, O, Msb;)
metaphorically thus termed; (S;) as in the saying, أَتَانَا فِى ظِلِّ اللَّيْلِ [He came to us in the
blackness of the night]: (S, O:) or it signifies
جُنْحُ اللَّيْلِ [app. as meaning the darkness, and
confusedness, of the night; see جُنْحٌ]; (M, TA;)
or so الظِّلُّ: (K:) or this means the night, (M,
K, TA,) itself; (M, TA;) so the astronomers
say: (TA:) all the night is ظِلٌّ: and so is all
the period from the shining of the dawn to the
rising of the sun. (T.) ―
-b3-  ظِلُّ النَّهَارِ is The colour
of the day when the sun predominates over it [app.
meaning when the light of the sun predominates
over that of the early dawn]. (K.) ―
-b4-  ظِلُّ
السَّحَابِ means Such, of the clouds, as conceal the
sun: or the blackness of the clouds. (M, K.) ―
-b5-
And ظِلَالُ البَحْرِ means The waves of the sea;
(O, K, TA;) because they are raised so as to
shade the ship and those that are in it. (TA.)
―
-b6-  ظِلٌّ also signifies A خَيَال (M, O, K) that is
seen, (M, K,) [i. e. an apparition, a phantom, or
a thing that one sees like a shadow, i. e. what we
term a shade,] of the jinn, or genii, and of others:
(M, O, K:) or the like of a خَيَال of the jinn.
(T.) ―
-b7-  Also Anything that shades one. (TA.)
―
-b8-  And it is the subst. from أَظَلَّنِى الشَّىْءُ meaning “ the thing covered me; ” (M, K;) [i. e. it
means A covering;] in which sense Th explains
it in the phrase إِلَى ظِلٍّ ذِى ثَلَاثِ شُعَبٍ [in the
Kur lxxvii. 30, Unto a covering having three
parts, or divisions]; saying, the meaning is that
the fire will have covered them; not that its
ظِلّ will be like that of the present world. (M.
[See شُعْبَةٌ.]) And ظِلُّ الشَّىْءِ means (assumed tropical:)  That which
serves for the veiling, covering, or protecting, of
the thing; syn. كِنُّهُ. (M.) [Hence] one says,
فُلَانٌ يَعِيشُ فِى ظِلِّ فُلَانٍ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one lives]
in the shelter, or protection, of such a one. (T, *
S, O, Msb, * K. *) And السُّلْطَانُ ظِلُّ اللّٰهِ فِى الأَرْضِ,
(O, TA,) a saying of the Prophet, (O,) [meaning
(assumed tropical:)  The sovereign, or ruling, power is God's means
of defence in the earth,] because he wards off
harm from the people like as the ظِلّ [properly
so called] wards off the harm of the heat of the
sun: (TA:) or the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  God's means
of protection: or God's خَاصَّة [or special
servant]. (O, TA.) ―
-b9-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Might; or power
of resistance or defence: (M, K, TA:) whence
[as some say] its usage in the Kur xiii. 35, and
the usage of [the pl.] ظِلَال in xxxvi. 56 and in
lxxvii. 41: [but the primary signification is more
appropriate in these instances:] and so in the
saying, جَعَلَنِى فِى ظِلِّهِ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He placed me
within the scope of his might, or power of resistance or defence]: so says Er-Rághib. (TA.) ―
-b10-
And (assumed tropical:)  A state of life ample in its means or
circumstances, unstraitened, or plentiful, and easy,
pleasant, soft, or delicate. (TA.) ―
-b11-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The
beginning of winter. (T, O. [Accord. to the
copies of the K, of youthfulness: but I think
that الشَّبَاب in this instance, in the K, is evidently
a mistranscription for الشِّتَآء.]) And (assumed tropical:)  The
vehemence (T, O, K) of the heat (T, O) of
summer. (T, O, K.) ―
-b12-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The شَخْص [as
meaning person of a human being, and as meaning the bodily or corporeal form or figure or substance which one sees from a distance, or the
material substance,] of anything; (M, K, TA;
[in the second and third of which is added, “or
its كِنّ,” a signification which I have mentioned
above on the authority of the M;]) because of
its [apparent] blackness [or darkness, resembling
that of a shade or shadow]: (M, TA:) whence
the saying, لَا يُفَارِقُ ظِلِّى ظِلَّكَ (assumed tropical:)  [My person will
not quit thy person]; like the saying, لَا يُفَارِقُ
سَوَادِى سَوَادَكَ: and the following exs. have been
cited as instances of ظِلّ in the sense of شَخْص:
the saying of a poet,
لَمَّا نَزَلْنَا رَفَعْنَا ظِلَّ أَخْبِيَةٍ
[as though meaning When we alighted, we raised
the material fabric of tents], for it is said that
they do not set up the ظِلّ which is the فَىْء, but
they only set up the tents; and the saying of
another,
تَتَبَّعَ أَفْيَآءَ الظِّلَالِ عَشِيَّةً
[as though meaning He followed the shadows of
the material objects in the evening]: but Er-Rághib says that the former means, we raised
the tents, and so raised the ظِلّ thereof; and in
the other ex., الظلال is a general term, and الفَىْء
[or افيآء] is a special term, so that it is an
instance of the إِضَافَة of a thing to its kind [i. e.
of prefixing a noun to one significant of its kind].
(TA.) [See also ظَلَالَةٌ.] ―
-b13-  And accord. to Ibn-
'Abbád, (O,) it signifies also The nap, or villous
substance, upon the surface of a garment, or piece
of cloth; syn. زِئْبِرٌ. (O, K.)
ظَلَّةٌ i. q. إِقَامَةٌ [Continuance, residence, abode,
&c.]. (K.) ―
-b2-  And i. q. صِحَّةٌ: thus accord. to
the copies of the K; but this may be a mistranscription; for Az and others mention, among the
significations of ظلّة, [in a copy of the T, written
in this case, as in others, ↓ ظُلَّة,] that of صَيْحَةٌ
[q. v.]. (TA.)
ظُلَّةٌ A thing that covers, or protects, [or shades,]
one, overhead: accord. to Lth, i. q. ↓ مَظَلَّةٌ or
مِظَلَّةٌ meaning a thing that shades one from the
sun: (T:) see an ex. voce مِظَلَّةٌ: a covering:
and i. q. بُرْطُلَّةٌ: (M, K:) this latter word correctly signifies a مِظَلَّة for the summer: (TA in
art. برطل:) and a thing by which one is protected
from the cold and the heat: (M:) anything that
protects and shades one, as a building or a mountain or a cloud: (Mgh:) the first portion that
shades (AZ, S, K) of a cloud (AZ, S) or of
clouds; (K;) accord. to Er-Rághib, mostly said
of that which is deemed unwholesome, and which
is disliked; whence the use of the word in the
Kur vii. 170: (TA:) and what shades one, of
trees: (K:) or anything that forms a covering
over one, (T, TA,) or shades one: (T:) and
[particularly] a thing like the صُفَّة [q. v.], (S,
M, O, K,) by which one protects himself from the
heat and the cold: (K:) or, accord. to the
lawyers, ظُلَّةُ الدَّارِ means the سُدَّة [or projecting
roof] over the door of the house: or that of which
the beams have one end upon the house and the
other end upon the wall of the opposite neighbour:
(Mgh:) pl. ظُلَلٌ (S, M, O, K) and ظِلَالٌ. (M,
K.) [See also ظَلَالٌ.] One says also, دَامَتْ ظُلَّةُ
الظِّلِّ and الظِّلِّ ↓ ظِلَالَةُ, meaning That whereby
one shades himself, (K, TA,) of trees, or of stones,
or of other things, (TA,) [continued.] عَذَابُ يَوْمِ
الظُّلَّةِ, in the Kur. [xxvi. 189], is said to mean
[The punishment of the day of] clouds beneath
which was a hot wind (سَمُوم): (S, O, K:) or
an overshadowing cloud, beneath which they collected themselves together, seeking protection thereby
from the heat that came upon them, whereupon
it covered them, (T, * K, TA,) and they perished
beneath it: (T, TA:) or, accord. to some, i. q.
عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الصُّفَّةِ. (T: see art. صف.) And
لَهُمْ مِنْ فَوْقِهِمْ ظُلَلٌ مِنَ النَّارِ وَمِنْ تَحْتِهِمْ ظُلَلٌ, in
the Kur [xxxix. 18], means To them shall be
above them coverings of fire, and beneath them
coverings to those below them; Hell consisting
of stages, one beneath another. (T, TA.) Seditions, or conflicts and factions, are mentioned in
a trad. as being like ظُلَل, by which are meant
Mountains, and clouds: and El-Kumeyt likens
waves of the sea to ظُلَل. (TA.) And [the pl.]
ظُلَلٌ is used as meaning The chambers of a
prison. (M, TA.)
-A2-  See also ظَلَّةٌ.
ظِلَّةٌ i. q. ظِلَالٌ; (T, K, TA;) app. a pl. of
ظَلِيلٌ, like as طِلَّةٌ is of طَلِيلٌ. (TA.)
ظَلَلٌ Water that is beneath a tree, (O,) or
beneath trees, (K,) upon which the sun does not
come. (O, K.) [See also ضَلَلٌ.]
ظَلَالٌ, like سَحَابٌ, [so accord. to the K, but
in my copies of the S, ↓ ظِلَال,] A thing that
shades one, (IAar, S, O, K, TA,) such as a cloud,
(IAar, S, TA,) and the like. (IAar, TA.) [See
also ظُلَّةٌ.]
ظِلَالٌ pl. of ظِلٌّ: (S, M, O, K:) ―
-b2-  and of
ظُلَّةٌ. (M, K.) ―
-b3-  [Also, app., pl. of ظَلِيلٌ: see
ظِلَّةٌ. ―
-b4-  Freytag has app. understood it to be
expl. in the K as syn. with مَظَلَّةٌ; though it
certainly is not.] ―
-b5-  See also ظَلَالٌ.
مَكَانٌ ظَلِيلٌ A place having shade: (M, K:)
or having constant shade. (T, S, M, O, K.) And
hence ظِلٌّ ظَلِيلٌ (M, K) Constant shade: (S:)
or extensive shade: (O:) or in this case the latter
word denotes intensiveness [meaning dense]; (M,
K, TA;) being like شَاعِرٌ in the phrase شِعْرٌ شَاعِرٌ.
(TA.) ظِلًّا ظَلِيلًا in the Kur iv. 60 is said by
Er-Rághib to be an allusion to ease and pleasantness of life. (TA.) One says also أَيْكَةٌ ظَلِيلَةٌ
A collection of trees tangled, or luxuriant, or
abundant and dense. (TA.) In the saying of
Uheyhah Ibn-El-Juláh, describing palm-trees,
هِىَ الظِّلُّ فِى الحَرِّ حَقَّ الظَّلِ??
??لِ وَالمَنْظَرُ الأَحْسَنُ الأَجْمَلُ
[ISd says] in my opinion, he means الشَّىْءُ الظَّلِيلُ
حَقَّ الظَّلِيلِ; [so that the verse should be rendered
They are the shade in the heat, the shady thing,
the extremely shady, and the most goodly, the most
beautiful, thing at which one looks; (see the
phrase هٰذَا العَالِمُ حَقَّ العَالِمِ, voce حَقٌّ;)] the
inf. n. being put in the place of the subst. (M.)
لَا ظَلِيلٍ in the Kur [lxxvii. 31] means Not
profitable as the shade in protecting from the
heat. (TA.)
ظَلَالَةٌ, (M, TA,) with fet-h, (TA,) the subst.
from the verb in the phrase ظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الغَمَامَ
[expl. above, see 2; as such app. meaning either
The making to give shade, like the inf. n. تَظْلِيلٌ,
or a thing that gives shade, like ظِلَالَةٌ]. (M,
TA.) ―
-b2-  And i. q. شَخْصٌ [expl. above, see ظِلٌّ,
last quarter]: (O, K:) and so طَلَالَةٌ, with ط. (O.)
ظِلَالَةٌ: see ظُلَّةٌ. ―
-b2-  Also A cloud that one sees
by itself, and of which one sees the shadow upon
the earth. (K.) ―
-b3-  And one says, رَأَيْتُ ظِلَالَةً
مِنَ الطَّيْرِ i. e. غَيَابَةً [app. meaning I saw a
covert, or place of concealment, of birds]. (TA.)
ظَلِيلَةٌ A place in which a little water collects
and stagnates in a water-course and the like:
(Lth, T:) or a place in which water collects and
stagnates in the lower part of the torrent of a
valley: (M, K:) or the like of an excavated
hollow in the interior of a water-course, such that
the water stops, and remains therein: (AA, O:)
pl. ظَلَائِلُ. (Lth, AA, T, O.) And A meadow
(رَوْضَة) abounding with collections of trees, or of
dense and tangled trees: (AA, T, O, K:) pl. as
above. (K.)
ظُلَّيْلَةٌ A thing which a man makes for himself,
of trees, or of a garment, or piece of cloth, by
which to protect himself from the heat of the sun:
a vulgar word. (TA.)
ظُلْظُلٌ i. q. سُعْنٌ, i. e. A ↓ مِظَلَّة [q. v.; or as
expl. in the L, in art. سعن, a ظُلَّة (q. v.), or a
thing like the ظُلَّة, which is made upon the flat
house-tops, for the purpose of guarding against
the dew that comes from the direction of the sea in
the time of the greatest heat]; on the authority of
IAar. (T. [Accord. to the O and K, i. q. سُفُنٌ,
which is evidently a mistranscription.])
أَظَلُّ [More, and most, dense in shade]. The
Arabs say, لَيْسَ شَىْءٌ أَظَلَّ مِنْ حَجَرٍ [There is not
anything more dense in shade than a stone].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And أَظَلّ, [as a subst., i. e. أَظَلٌّ
accord. to a general rule, or, if regarded as originally an epithet, it may be أَظَلُّ,] by poetic
license أَظْلَل, (S, M, O, K,) signifies The under
part, (S, O,) or the concealed part, (M, AHei,
K,) of the مَنْسِم, (S, M, O, K,) or of the خُفّ,
(AHei, TA,) [the former app. here used, as it is
said be in other cases, in the same sense as the
latter, meaning the foot,] of the camel; (S, M,
O, AHei, K;) so called because of its being
concealed: (AHei, TA:) and, (M, K,) in a
human being, (M,) الأَظَلُّ signifies بَطْنُ الإِصْبَعِ;
(M, K;) and [ISd says] this is in my opinion
the right explanation; but it is said that أَظَلُّ
الإِنْسَانِ signifies بُطُونُ أَصَابِعِهِ, which means the
portion, of what is next to the fore part [of the
bottom] of the foot, from the root of the great toe
to the root of the little toe, of the human being:
(M:) the pl. is ظُلٌّ, which is anomalous, (M,
K,) or formed after the manner of the pl. of an
epithet: (M:) or الظُّلُّ فِى الإِنْسَانِ means the
roots, or bases, (أُصُول) of what are termed بُطُونُ
الأَصَابِعِ, next to the fore part [of the bottom] of
the foot. (Ibn-'Abbád, O.) Hence the prov.,
إِنْ يَدْمَ أَظَلُّكَ فَقَدْ نَقِبَ خُفِّى [If the fore part of
the sole of thy foot be bleeding, the sole of my foot
has become worn through, in holes: see نَقِبَ]:
said to the complainer to him who is in a worse
condition than he. (AHei, TA.)
مظلّ [app. مَظِلٌّ, being from ظَلَّ of which the
aor. is يَظِلُّ; A place of shade, or of continual
shade]. One says, هٰذَا مُنَاخِى وَمَحَلِّى وَبَيْتِى وَمظلِّى
[This is my nightly resting-place for the camels,
and my place of abode, and my tent, and my
place of shade, or of continual shade]. (TA.)
مُظِلٌّ A thing having shade; by means of which
one shades himself; as also ↓ مُظَلِّلٌ. (Msb.)
And [A cloudy day;] a day having clouds: or
having continual shade. (TA.)
مِظَلَّةٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and مَظَلَّةٌ, (T, M,
Msb, K,) the former with kesr to the م as an
instrumental noun, (Msb,) [and the latter with
fet-h as a noun of place,] A large tent of [goats']
hair; (S, O, Msb;) more ample than the خِبَآء;
so says El-Fárábee: (Msb:) one of the kinds of
tents of the Arabs of the desert, the largest of the
tents of [goats'] hair; next after which is the
وَسُوط; and then, the خِبَآء, which is the smallest
of the tents of [goats'] hair; so says AZ: but
Aboo-Málik says that the مظلّة and the خبآء are
small and large: IAar says that the خَيْمَة is of
poles roofed with [the panic grass called] ثَمَام,
and is not of cloths; but the مظلّة is of cloths:
(T:) or it is of the tents called أَخْبِيَة; (M;) such
as is large, of the أَخْبِيَة; (K;) and it is said to
be only of cloths; and it is large, having a رِوَاق
[q. v.]; but sometimes it is of one oblong piece of
cloth (شُقَّة), and of two such pieces, and of three;
and sometimes it has a كِفَآء, which is its hinder
part: or, accord. to Th, it is peculiarly of
[goats'] hair: (M:) see also ظُلَّةٌ, and ظُلْظُلٌ:
the pl. is مَظَالُّ; (M, Msb;) and مَظَالِ or مَظَالِى
occurs at the end of a verse of Umeiyeh Ibn-Abee-'Áïdh El-Hudhalee, for مَظَالِّ; the [latter]
ل being either elided, or changed into ى. (M.)
عِلَّةٌ مَا عِلَّةُ أَوْتَادٍ وَأَخِلَّةٍ وَعَمَدِ المِظَلَّةِ اُبْرُزُوا لِصِهْرِكُمْ
↓ ظُلَّةٌ [A pretext: what is the pretext of tentpegs, and of pins for fastening together the edges
of the pieces of the tent-cloth, and of the poles of
the large tent? go ye forth: he who has married
among you has a tent for shade from the sun:] is
a prov., and was said by a girl who had been
married to a man, and whose family delayed to
conduct her to her husband, urging in excuse
that they had not the apparatus of the tent: she
said this to urge them, and to put a stop to their
excuse: (Meyd, TA: *) and the prov. is applied
in attributing untruth to pretexts. (Meyd.) ―
-b2-
Hence, as being likened thereto, (assumed tropical:)  A booth, or
shed, made of palm-sticks, and covered with [the
panic grass called] ثُمَام. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  And The
thing [i. e. umbrella] by means of which kings are
shaded on the occasion of their riding; called in
Pers. چَتْر. (TA.)
عَرْشٌ مُظَلَّلٌ [A booth, or shed, shaded over] is
from الظِّلُّ. (S.)
مُظَلِّلٌ: see مُظِلٌّ.
مُسْتَظِلٌّ Blood that is in the جَوْف [or belly, or
interior of the belly, or the chest]. (T, O.) ―
-b2-
And [Az says,] I heard a man of the tribe of
Teiyi apply the term المُسْتَظِلَّاتُ [so accord. to a
copy of the T, but in the TA المُسْتَظِلُّ,] to
Certain thin flesh, adhering to the interior of the
two fetlock-joints of the camel, than which there is
in the flesh of the camel none thinner, nor any
softer, but there is in it no grease. (T.)
