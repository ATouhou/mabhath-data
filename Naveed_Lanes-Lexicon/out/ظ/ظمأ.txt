shortest ظِمْءٌ of camels is that termed غِبٌّ, i. e.,

to the water [again] on the third day; the interval between their two drinkings being termed a
ظِمْء: this is during the greatest heat: but when
Suheyl [i. e. Canopus] rises [aurorally, which it
did in Central Arabia, about the commencement
of the era of the Flight, on the 4th of August,
O. S.], they increase the ظِمْء, so that the camels
remain in the place of pasture two days, and
come to the water on the fourth; and one says,
وَرَدَتْ رِبْعًا: then follow the خِمْس and the سِدْس
to the عِشْر: and the interval between their two
drinkings is termed ظِمْءٌ, whether long or short.
