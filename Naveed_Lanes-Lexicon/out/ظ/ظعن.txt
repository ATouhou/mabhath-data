8
اِظَّعَنَتْهُ She rode him, (S, K, TA,) namely,
a camel: you say, هٰذَا بَعِيرٌ تَظَّعِنُهُ المَرْأَةُ This is a
camel that the woman rides (S, TA) in her
journeying, and in the day of her departure.
(TA.)

-A2-  and see also ظَاعِنٌ.

manner, of journeying or departing. (TA.)

ظَعِينَةٌ A هَوْدَج [or woman's camel-vehicle] (S,
Mgh, Msb, K, TA) in which is a woman, (TA,)
or whether there be in it a woman or not:
(S, Msb, K, TA:) this is [said to be] the primary
signification: (Mgh:) pl. ظَعَائِنُ and ظُعُنٌ (S,
Mgh, Msb, K) and ظُعْنٌ (S, K) and [pl. of pauc.]
أَظْعَانٌ (S, Mgh, K) and pl. pl. ظُعُنَاتٌ. (TA.
[But see, in what follows, an assertion of AZ
respecting the pl. ظُعُنٌ.]) ―
-b2-  And A woman,
(ISk, Mgh, Msb, TA;) whether in a هَوْدَج or
elsewhere; (ISk, TA;) the word being used in
the sense of مَظْعُونَةٌ [for مَظْعُونٌ بِهَا]; because
her husband journeys (يَظْعَنُ) with her: (Msb:)
or a man's wife; because she journeys with her
husband: (TA:) or a woman as long as she is in
the هودج; (S, Msb, K;) when not in it she is
not thus called: (S:) or this is the primary
meaning: then it was applied to her though in
her tent, because she might become مَظْعُونَة [i. e.
مَظْعُون بِهَا]: (Msb:) it is mostly applied to a
woman riding [in a هودج]: then, to a هودج
without a woman: and to a woman without a
هودج. (TA.) 'Amr Ibn-Kulthoom says,
قِفِى قَبْلَ التَّفَرُّقِ يَا ظَعِينَا
نُخَبِّرْكِ اليَقِينَ وَتُخْبِرِينَا
[Pause thou before separation, O woman in the
camel-vehicle: we will inform thee of the real
truth respecting our case, and thou shalt inform
us respecting thy case]: (S:) يَا ظَعِينَا is for يَا
ظَعِينَةُ. (EM p. 185.) ―
-b3-  And, accord. to Lth,
A camel that is ridden by women: [like ظَعُونٌ:]
and applied to signify a woman because she
rides it: or, accord. to IAmb, a camel upon
which one journeys: and hence the trad., لَيْسَ
فِى جَمَلٍ ظَعِينَةٍ صَدَقَةٌ i. e. [There is no poor-rate
in the case of] the camel upon which one journeys;
if the phrase be thus: but if it be فِى جَمَلِ ظَعِينَةٍ,
by the last word is meant a woman: (TA:) AZ
says, one should not say حُمُولٌ nor ظُعُنٌ except
as meaning the camels upon which are هَوَادِج,
whether there be in them women or not. (S.)
ظَاعِنٌ Journeying, going away, departing, or
removing: (Msb:) [a traveller:] any one going
forth on a journey, on pilgrimage, or on a warring and plundering expedition, or journeying
from one city [or town &c.] to another: contr.
of خَافِضٌ [and of مُقِيمٌ]: one says, أَظَاعِنٌ أَنْتَ
أَمْ مُقِيمٌ [Art thou journeying or abiding?]: the
pl. is ظَاعِنُونَ and ظُعُنٌ, and ↓ ظَعَنٌ is a quasipl. n. syn. with ظَاعِنُونَ. (TA.)
مِظْعَانٌ, applied to a horse or mare, and to a
she-camel, Easy in pace. (TA.)
مَظْعُونٌ Made to journey, go away, depart, or
remove; originally مَظْعُونٌ بِهِ; the complement
being suppressed because of frequency of usage.
(Msb.)
