2
ظُرِّبَتِ الحَوَافِرُ, inf. n. تَظْرِيبٌ, The solid hoofs
became hard and strong. (T, K.)
ظَرِبٌ A stone projecting (Lth, T, M, Msb, K)
from a mountain or from rugged ground (Lth,
T) and having a sharp point: (Lth, T, M, K:) or
an expanded mountain, (M, K, TA,) accord. to
some, that is not high: (TA:) or a small mountain: (M, K:) or a small hill: (T, S, Msb:)
pl. ظِرَابٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and أَظْرُبٌ, (Nh,
TA,) [the latter a pl. of pauc.,] the former pl. of
a rare kind, for by rule it should be أَظْرَابٌ, and
it seems as though they had imagined the sing. to
be ظَرْبٌ, and so made the pl. like سِهَامٌ, pl. of
سَهْمٌ: (Msb, TA:) or, accord. to En-Nadr, ظَرِبٌ
signifies the smallest of [hills such as are termed]
آكَام, and the sharpest in stones, all its stones
being sharp like knives, the white thereof and the
black and of every colour: and the pl. is أَظْرَابٌ.
(T.) [See also this pl. below.]
ظُرُبٌّ Short, and thick, (M, K, TA,) and fleshy:
(Lh, TA:) or a short and fleshy man. (S.)
ظَرْبَى and ظِرْبَى: see ظَرِبَانٌ, in three places.
ظِرْبَآء and ظَِرِبَآء: see the next paragraph, in four
places.
ظَرِبَانٌ (S, M, Msb, K, &c.) and ظِرْبَانٌ (AA,
AZ, Msb, TA) and ظَرْبَانٌ (IJ, TA) and ↓ ظِرَبَآءُ
(M, CK, TA, or ↓ ظِرْبَآء or ↓ ظِرِبَآء accord. to two
different copies of the K) A small, stinking beast,
(AZ, S, M, Msb, K,) resembling a cat, (AZ, S,
M, K,) or resembling a short Chinese dog, (Msb,)
or resembling an ape or a monkey, (AA, T, M,
TA,) or above the whelp of a dog, (El-Mustaksee,
TA,) that often emits a noiseless wind from the
anus; (M, Msb, * TA;) said by Az, on the
authority of the handwriting of AHeyth, to be
a beast that has small legs, their length being that
of half a finger, but which is broad, its breadth
being equal to the space measured by the extension
of the thumb and the little finger, or of the thumb
and the fore finger, and its length being a cubit,
having a compact head, and its ears [for ادناه, in
my original, I read أُذُنَاهُ] being like the cat's;
(TA;) it is small and short in the ears, (أَصْلَمُ
الأُذُنَيْنِ, M, Msb,) or having a stoppage of the
ears, (أَصَمُّ الاذنين, TA,) its earholes [only] hearing a confused, or humming, or ringing, sound;
(M, TA;) long in the snout, [but El-Farezdak
speaks of it as having a short nose, as is shown
in the S,] black in the back, white in the belly;
(M, Msb, TA;) it is said that its back is [or
rather contains] one single bone, without any قَفَص
[or cage-formed structure of ribs, &c.], and that
the sword has no effect upon it by reason of the
hardness of its skin, unless striking its nose: (TA:)
the pl. is ظَرَابِينُ, (M, K,) or ظَرَابِىُّ, (AZ, T, S,
Msb,) sometimes, (S,) or this latter also, (M, K,)
as though it were pl. of ظِرْبَآء, (S,) or the first ى
is a substitute for the ا [of the sing. ظَرِبَانٌ] and
the second for the ن, (M,) and (quasi-pl. ns.,
M, K) ↓ ظِرْبَى (AZ, T, M, Msb, K) and ↓ ظِرْبَآءُ,
(M, K,) or ↓ ظِرْبَى, is a pl. like حِجْلَى pl. of
حَجَلٌ, (S, TA,) and these two are [said to be]
the only pls. of this measure, (AHei, TA,) and
Lth and AHeyth say that ظِرْبَآءُ is incorrect, and
is rightly ↓ ظِرْبَى. (T, TA.) A poet says, (namely,
'Abd-Allah Ibn-Hajjáj Ez-Zebeedee, M, TA,)
أَلَا أَبْلِغَا قَيْسًا وَخِنْدِفَ أَنَّنِى
ضَرَبْتُ كَثِيرًا مَضْرِبَ الظَّرِبَانِ
[Now tell ye Keys and Khindif that I have struck
Ketheer in the place of striking of the ظربان],
meaning that he had struck Ketheer Ibn-Shiháb
(S, M, TA) El-Medh-hijee upon his face; for
the ظربان has a line, or long mark, upon his
face; and he likens the blow that he inflicted
upon his face to that mark: [see مَضْرِبٌ:] and
the same words of the latter hemistich, except
that عُبَيْدًا is substituted in them for كَثِيرًا, occur
in a verse of Asad Ibn-Nághisah, who slew
'Obeyd by order of En-Noamán. (TA.) One
says, فَسَا بَيْنَنَا الظَّرِبَانُ, (S,) or بَيْنَهُم, (Msb, K,) [lit.
The ظربان emitted a noiseless wind from its anus
among us, or among them,] a prov., (S,) meaning
that we, or they, became disunited, and alienated,
one from another: [for] when this animal emits
a noiseless wind from its anus in the garment of
a man, the stink does not go away until the garment wears out: (S, Msb, K:) the Arabs of the
desert assert that it does so in the garment of him
who hunts it: (S:) and it is said to do so in the
hole of the [lizard called] ضَبّ, which, being
stupified by the foulness of the stink, is taken
and eaten by it. (M, K, TA.) One says also,
تَشَاتَمَا فَكَأَنَّمَا جَزَرَا بَيْنَهُمَا ظَرِبَانًا [They reviled each
other, and it was as though they slaughtered
between them a ظربان]: the foulness of their
reviling being likened to the stink of that animal.
(M, TA.) And يَتَنَازَعَانِ جِلْدَ الظَّرِبَانِ They two
contend in pulling at the skin of the ظربان,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  they revile each other: (M, TA:) and
يَتَمَاشَنَانِ جِلْدَ الظَّرِبَانِ They wipe their hands together upon the skin of the ظربان, [likewise]
meaning (assumed tropical:)  they revile each other. (IAar, T, TA.)
الأَظْرَابُ [accord. to some] signifies Four teeth
behind the نَوَاجِذ [or other grinders; app.
meaning, of a horse]: (K:) or the sockets (أَسْنَاخ)
of the teeth: (S, K:) [and it is said that] أَظْرَابُ
اللِّجَامِ signifies the knots that are at the extremities of the bit. (M, TA.) J cites the following
verse, ascribing it to 'Ámir Ibn-Et-Tufeyl,
وَمُقَطِّعٍ حَلَقَ الرِّحَالَةِ سَابِحٍ
بَادٍ نَوَاجِذُهُ عَنِ الأَظْرَابِ
[thus in the S, (but in the M and TA عَلَى
الأَظْرَابِ,) as though meaning And breaking in
pieces the rings of the girth of the saddle, running
with the fore legs well stretched forth, his grinders
appearing from the sockets]: but IB says, [following the reading in the M and TA,] the verse is
by Lebeed; and the poet is describing a horse
that breaks in pieces the rings of the saddle
by his springing forward, and whose grinders
(نَوَاجِذُهُ) appear when he treads upon the [stones,
or hills, called] ظِرَاب: [see ظَرِبٌ, of which both
ظِرَابٌ and أَظْرَابٌ are said to be pls.:] also that
the right reading is وَمُقَطِّعٌ [and سَابِحٌ]: and by
the نواجذ are meant the ضَوَاحِك [or teeth next
behind the canine teeth], accord. to Hr. (TA.)
حَوَافِرُ مُظَرَّبَةٌ [accord. to the TA مُظَرِّبَةٌ, but this
is evidently a mistake (see 2),] means [Solid
hoofs] that have become hard and strong: (K,
TA:) [but] accord. to El-Mufaddal, المُظَرَّبُ,
like مُعَظَّم [in measure], signifies الَّذِى قَدْ لَوَّحَتْهُ
الظِّرَابُ [app. meaning that which the stones, or
hills, called ظِرَاب have altered, or, perhaps,
heated, in its treading upon them]. (TA.)
