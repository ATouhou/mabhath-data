kind and of the sheep and goat (S, O, Msb, K)
and of the gazelle or antelope (S, O, K) and the
like, (O, Msb, K,) which is to them like the ظُفْر
to man, (Msb,) or like the قَدَم to us: (K:) one
says the رِجْل and قَدَم of a man, and the حَافِر of a
horse, and the خُفّ of a camel and of an ostrich,
and the ظِلْف of a bovine animal and of a sheep
or goat [and the like]: (ISk, T, TA:) pl. أَظْلَافٌ

one, have all of them brought forth [app. one after
another]. (M.) ―
-b4-  Also A thing that is suitable
to the requirements of a man, and of a beast:
(M:) and an object of desire: (M, O, K:) and
an object of want. (T, K.) One says, أَصَابَ
فُلَانٌ ظِلْفَهُ Such a one attained what was suitable
to his requirements, and what he desired: and
sometimes one says the like of any beast that
finds, or lights on, or meets with, that which he
likes. (M.) وَجَدَتِ الدَّابَّةُ ظِلْفَهَا is a prov., (M,
O,) applied to him who finds the means of attaining that which he seeks; (Meyd;) meaning [The
beast found what was suitable to its requirements;
or,] what withheld it [from other things] and
prevented its desire [thereof]. (A, TA. [See

says, وَجَدَتِ الشَّاةُ ظِلْفَهَا The sheep, or goat, found
suitable pasturage, and therefore did not quit it:

him, of men and of beasts, that finds what is
