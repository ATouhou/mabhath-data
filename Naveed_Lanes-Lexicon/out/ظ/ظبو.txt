ظبوظُبَةٌ The حَدّ, (T, M, Msb, K,) or طَرَف, (S,)
[both of which mean the end, or extremity, but
the former means also the edge,] of a sword, (T,
S, M, Msb, K,) or of a spear-head and the like,
(K,) or also of a spear-head and of an arrowhead and of a dagger and the like; (M;) or the
part next to the طَرَف [or extremity] of the sword;
also called its ذُبَاب: (T:) or the ظُبَتَانِ are the
parts of the two edges that are on either side of
the ذُبَاب [by which last word is here app. meant
the point] of the sword: (AZ, T and TA voce
ذُبَابٌ, q. v.:) [for the swords of the Arabs, in
the older times, were generally straight, twoedged, and tapering to a point:] or, accord. to
Aboo-Riyásh, the ظُبَة of the sword is the part
that is four digits' measure below, or within,
(دُونَ,) the ذُبَاب thereof; and is the strikingplace thereof: and it is also its حَدّ; and the
ظُبَة of the spear-head is likewise its حَدّ: (Ham
p. 48:) the ة in ظُبَةٌ is a substitute for و, which
is the final radical, (S, M, Msb, K,) the word
being originally ظُبَوٌ: (S, TA:) the pl. is أَظْبٍ,
(S, K,) a pl. of pauc., (S,) and ظُبَاتٌ (T, S, M,
Msb, K) and ظُبَاةٌ [which is originally ظُبَوَةٌ] (S, *
TA) and ظُبُونَ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and ظِبُونَ and
ظُبًا or ظُبًى. (M, K.) In the saying of EsSemow-al Ibn-'Ádiyà,
تَسِيلُ عَلَى حَدِّ الظُّبَاتِ نُفُوسُنَا
وَلَيْسَتْ عَلَى غَيْرِ الظُّبَاتِ تَسِيلُ
[Our bloods flow upon the edge of the ظبات, and
upon other than the edge of the ظبات they flow
not], by the ظبات may be meant the swords,
altogether, or the striking-places of the swords.
(Ham p. 52. [See also a similar ex. in p. 48 of
the same.])
-A2-  Also A kind of مَزَاد [or leathern
water-bag]. (M.)
-A3-  And A place of bending,
or turning, of a valley; like ظَبْيَةٌ [which belongs
to art. ظبى]: pl. of the former ظُبَآءٌ, a pl. of a
rare form. (M in art. ظبى.)
