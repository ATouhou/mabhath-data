ظلم1
ظَلَمَ, aor.
ظَلِمَ, has for its inf. n. ظَلْمٌ, (M,
Msb, K, and so in some copies of the S,) or
↓ ظُلْمٌ, (so in other copies of the S,) or both, (T,)
or the latter is a simple subst., (T, M, Msb, TA,)
which is put in the place of the inf. n., (TA,
[and the same is indicated in the T and K by the
saying that the proper inf. n. is with fet-h,]) and
↓ مَظْلِمَةٌ, (S, TA,) or this is likewise a simple
subst., (Msb,) and ↓ مَظْلَمَةٌ, [or this also is a
simple subst.,] and ↓ ظِلَامٌ also is said to be an
inf. n. like ظُلْمٌ, these two being like لِبَاسٌ and
لُبْسٌ, [or it is a simple subst. like as ظُلْمٌ is said
to be, or it is an inf. n. of 3, as such occurring in
the middle of this paragraph,] or, accord. to Kr,
it is pl. of ظُلْمٌ [like as رِمَاحٌ is pl. of رُمْحٌ]:
(TA:) [ظَلَمَ when intrans. generally means He
did wrong; or acted wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or tyrannically: and when trans., he
wronged; or treated, or used, wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or tyrannically; or he misused:] accord. to most of the lexicologists, (Er-Rághib, TA,) primarily, (As, T, S, Msb,) ↓ الظُّلْمُ
signifies the putting a thing in a place not its
own; putting it in a wrong place; misplacing it:
(As, T, S, M, Er-Rághib, Msb, K:) and it is
by exceeding or by falling short, or by deviating
from the proper time and place: (Er-Rághib,
TA:) or the acting in whatsoever way one pleases
in the disposal of the property of another: and
the transgressing the proper limit: (El-Munáwee,
TA:) [i. e.] the transgressing the proper limit
much or little: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or, accord. to
some, it primarily signifies النَّقْص [as meaning
the making to suffer loss, or detriment]: (MF,
TA:) and it is said to be of three kinds, between
man and God, and between man and man, and
between a man and himself; every one of which
three is really لِلنَّفْسِ [i. e. a wrongdoing to oneself]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [when it is used as a
simple subst.,] the pl. of ظُلْمٌ, accord. to Kr. is
ظِلَامٌ, as mentioned above, and ↓ ظُلَامٌ, with
damm, is said to be syn. with ظُلْمٌ, or a pl. thereof,
[of an extr. form, commonly regarded as that of
a quasi-pl. n.,] like رُخَالٌ. (TA.) One says,
مَنِ اسْتَرْعَى الذِّئْبَ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ [He who asks, or
desires, the wolf to keep guard surely does wrong,
or puts a thing in a wrong place]: a prov. (S,
Msb.) And مَنْ أَشْبَهَ أَبَاهُ فَمَا ظَلَمَ, (As, T, S,) a
prov., meaning [Whoso resembles his father in a
quality, or an attribute,] he has not put the likeness
in a wrong place. (As, T. [See art. شبه.]) وَلَمْ
تَظْلِمْ مِنْهُ شَيْئًا, in the Kur [xviii. 31], means
وَلَمْ تَنْقُصْ [i. e. And made not aught thereof to
suffer loss, or detriment]: (M, K:) and in like
manner Fr explains the saying in the Kur [ii. 54
and vii. 160], وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلٰكِنْ كَانُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ
يَظْلِمُونَ And they made not us to suffer loss, or
detriment, by that which they did, but themselves
they made to suffer loss, or detriment: (T, TA:) in
which sense it seems to be indicated in the A that
the verb is tropical. (TA.) ―
-b2-  It is also trans.
by means of بِ; as in the phrase in the Kur [vii.
101 and xvii. 61] فَظَلَمُوا بِهَا, because the meaning is كَفَرُوا [i. e. And they disbelieved in them],
referring to the آيَات [or signs]; (M, TA; *) the
verb having this meaning tropically or by implication; or being thus made trans. because implying the meaning of التَّكْذِيب: or [the meaning
is, and they wronged themselves, or the people,
because of them; for], as some say, the ب is
causative, and the objective complement, i. e.
أَنْفُسَهُمْ, or النَّاسَ, is suppressed. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And
it is doubly trans. by itself: (TA:) one says,
ظَلَمَهُ حَقَّهُ [He made him to suffer loss, or detriment, of his right, or due; or defrauded, or despoiled, or deprived, him of it]; and حَقَّهُ ↓ تظلّمهُ:
(M, K:) [and] you say, فُلَانٌ ↓ تَظَلَّمَنِى, [as
well as تظلّمنى مَالِى, occurring in a verse cited
in the M,] meaning ظَلَمَنِى مَالِى [i. e. Such a one
caused me to suffer loss, &c., of my property].
(S.) It is said in the Kur [iv. 44], إِنَّ اللّٰهَ لَا
يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ, for لَا يَظْلِمُهُمْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةِ, and the
verb is made doubly trans. because the meaning
is لَا يَسْلُبُهُمْ [i. e. Verily God will not despoil
them, or deprive them, of the weight of one of the
smallest of ants, or a grub of an ant, &c.]: or
مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ, may be put in the place of the inf. n.,
for ظَلْمًا حَقِيرًا كَمِثْقَالِ ذَرَّةٍ [i. e. with a paltry
spoliation or deprivation, such as the weight of one of
the smallest of ants, &c.]. (M.) ―
-b4-  One says also,
أَرَادَ ظِلَامَهُ and مُظَالَمَتَهُ, [these two nouns being
inf. ns. of ↓ ظَالَمَهُ, or the former, as mentioned
above, is, accord. to some, an inf. n. of ظَلَمَ,]
meaning ظُلْمَهُ or ظَلْمَهُ [i. e. He desired the
wronging, &c., of him]. (M, K.) ―
-b5-  ظَلَمَهُ,
inf. n. ظُلْمٌ [or ظَلْمٌ?], also means He imposed
upon him a thing that was above his power, or ability.
(TA.) And يُظْلَمُ He is asked for a thing that is
above his power, or ability. (S.) ―
-b6-  And one
says, ظَلَمَ البَعِيرَ (tropical:)  He slaughtered the camel without disease. (S, K, TA.) And ظُلِمَتِ النَّاقَةُ
(assumed tropical:)  The she-camel was slaughtered without disease:
or was covered without her desiring the stallion.
(M.) And ظَلَمَ الحِمَارُ الأَتَانَ (tropical:)  The he-ass leaped
the she-ass (K, TA) before her time: (TA:) or
when she was pregnant: (K, TA:) so in the A.
(TA.) ―
-b7-  And ظَلَمَ الوَطْبَ, (S, K,) inf. n. ظُلْمٌ
[or ظَلْمٌ?], (S,) (tropical:)  He gave to drink of the milk of
his skin before its becoming thick (S, K, TA) and
its butter's coming forth. (TA. [And the like is
said in the T and M.]) And ظَلَمَ القَوْمَ (assumed tropical:)  He
gave to drink to the people, or party, (T, M, K,)
milk before it had attained to maturity, (T, K,)
as related on the authority of A 'Obeyd, (T,) or
[milk such as is termed] ظَلِيمَة: (M:) but this is
a mistake: it is related on the authority of
Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà [i. e. Th] and AHeyth that
one says, ظَلَمْتُ السِّقَآءَ, and اللَّبَنَ, meaning I
drank, or gave to drink, what was in the skin,
and the milk, before its attaining to maturity and
the extracting of its butter: accord. to ISk, one
says, ظَلَمْتُ وَطْبِىَ القَوْمَ, [but I think that it is
correctly ظَلَمْتُ وَطْبِى لِلْقَومِ, agreeably with a
verse cited in the T and M,] meaning I gave to
drink [to the people, or party,] the contents of my
milk-skin before the thickening thereof. (T.)
And ظَلَمْتُهُ is said of anything as meaning (assumed tropical:)  I
did it hastily, or hurriedly, before its proper time,
or season. (M, TA.) ―
-b8-  ظَلَمْتُ الحَوْضَ means
(assumed tropical:)  I made the watering-trough in a place in which
watering-troughs should not be made. (ISk, T.)
And ظَلَمَ الأَرْضَ means (tropical:)  He dug the ground in
what was not the place of digging: (M, K, TA:)
or when it had not been dug before. (M.) And,
said of a torrent, (assumed tropical:)  It furrowed the earth in a
place that was not furrowed. (T.) And ظَلَمَ
البِطَاحَ, said of a torrent, (tropical:)  It reached the بطاح
[or wide water-courses containing fine, or broken,
pebbles, &c.], not having reached them before.
(A, TA.) And ظَلَمَ الوَادِى (tropical:)  The water of the
valley reached a place that it had not reached
before. (Fr, T, S, K, TA.) ―
-b9-  When men have
added upon the grave other than its own earth,
لَا تَظْلِمُوا (tropical:)  [Transgress not ye the proper limit]
is said to them. (TA.) ―
-b10-  And one says, لَا
تَظْلِمْ وَضَحَ الطَّرِيقِ (assumed tropical:)  Turn not thou from the
main part, or the beaten track, of the road.
(M.) And لَا تَظْلِمْ عَنْهُ شَيْئَا (assumed tropical:)  Turn not thou
from it at all. (T.) And لَزِمَ الطَّرِيقَ فَلَمْ يَظْلِمْهُ
(assumed tropical:)  [He kept to the road, and] did not turn from it
to the right and left. (TA.) ―
-b11-  And مَا ظَلَمَكَ
أَنْ تَفْعَلَ (T, K, TA) (tropical:)  What has prevented thy
doing (K, TA) such a thing? (TA.) A man
complained to Abu-l-Jarráh of his suffering
indigestion from food that he had eaten, and he
said to him, مَا ظَلَمَكَ أَنْ تَقِىْءَ (assumed tropical:)  [What has
prevented thy vomiting?]. (Fr, T.) And one
says, مَا ظَلَمَكَ عَنْ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  What has prevented
thee from such a thing? (T.) Respecting the
saying
قَالَ بَلَى يَا مَىَّ وَاليَوْمُ ظَلَمْ
[addressed by a man to a woman who had invited him to visit her], Fr says, they say that the
meaning is حَقًّا [Truly, or in truth; i. e. He
said, Yes, O Meiya, truly, or in truth, I will
visit thee]; and it is a prov.; (T;) or اليَوْمُ ظَلَمَ,
or بَلَى وَاليَوْمُ ظَلَمَ, is a prov.; (Meyd;) and thus
it was expl. by IAar, as used in the manner of
an oath: but Fr says, in my opinion the meaning
is, and a day in which is a cause of prevention
shall not prevent me: [so that the words of the
hemistich above may be rendered, he said, Yes,
O Meiya, though the day present an obstacle,
for I will overcome every obstacle]: (T:)
accord. to Kr, قَدِمَ فُلَانٌ وَاليَوْمُ ظَلَمَ means Such
a one came truly, or in truth: [or it may be
rendered such a one came though the day presented an obstacle:] but in the saying
إِنَّ الفِرَاقَ اليَوْمَ وَاليَوْمُ ظَلَمْ
the meaning is said by some to be وَاليَوْمُ ظَلَمَنَا
[i. e. Verily separation is to-day, and the day has
wronged (us)]: or, as some say, ظلم here means,
has put the thing in a wrong place: (M:)
accord. to ISk, the phrase وَاليَوْمُ ظَلَم means
[And, or but, or though,] the day has put the
affair in a wrong place. (T.) [See also Freytag's
Arab. Prov. ii. 911.]
-A2-  ظَلِمَ, said of the night:
see 4.
2
ظلّمهُ, inf. n. تَظْلِيمٌ, (T, S, &c.,) He told
him that he was ظَالِم [i. e. doing wrong or acting
wrongfully &c., or a wrongdoer]: (T:) or he
attributed, or imputed, to him ظُلْم [i. e. wrongdoing, &c.]. (S, M, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  And He (a
judge) exacted justice for him from his wronger,
and aided him against him. (T.)
3
ظَاْلَمَ see 1, in the middle of the paragraph.
4
اظلم, said of the night, (Fr, T, S, M, Msb,
K,) and ↓ ظَلِمَ, (Fr, T, S, K,) the latter with
kesr, (S,) like سَمِعَ, (K,) [erroneously written in
the TT as from the M ظَلَمَ,] It became dark; (S,
K;) or it became black; (M;) or it came with
its darkness. (Msb.) It is said in the Kur [ii.
19], وَإِذَا أَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ قَامُوا [And when it becomes
dark to them they stand still]; the verb being
intrans.: or, accord. to the Ksh, and Bd follows
it, it may be trans. [so that the meaning is, and
when He makes their place dark &c.]; as is
shown by another reading, which is أُظْلِمُوا:
accord. to AHei, it is known by transmission as
only intrans.; but Z makes it to be trans. by
itself; Ibn-Es-Saláh affirms it to be trans. and
intrans.: and Az [so in the TA, but correctly
ISd, in the M,] mentions the saying, تَكَلَّمَ فَأَظْلَمَ
عَلَيْنَا البَيعتَ (assumed tropical:)  [He spoke, and made dark to us
the house, or chamber, or tent], meaning he made
us to hear what we disliked, or hated, the verb
being trans. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And أَظْلَمُوا They entered
upon the ظَلَام [or darkness, or beginning of
night]: (S, M, Msb, K:) or, as in the Mufradát
[of Er-Rághib], they became in darkness. (TA.)
―
-b3-  And they said, مَا أَظْلَمَهُ and ما أَضْوَأَهُ [How
dark is it! and How light, or bright, is it!];
which is anomalous. (S, TA.)
-A2-  And اظلم
الثَّغْرُ The front teeth glistened. (T, K.) Hence
the saying [of a poet],
إِذَا مَا اجْتَلَى الرَّائِى إِلَيْهَا بِطَرْفِهِ
غُرُوبَ ثَنَايَاهَا أَضَآءَ وَأَظْلَمَا
[as though meaning, When the beholder of her
with his eye looks at the fineness, or sharpness,
(but غُرُوب is variously explained,) of her central
teeth, it shines brightly, and glistens: but Az
plainly indicates another meaning; i. e., he sees
(lit. lights on, or finds,) brightness and lustre; for
he immediately adds, without the intervention of
وَ or أَوْ, evidently in relation to this verse,] أَضَآءَ
أَىْ أَصَابَ ضَوْءًا وَأَظْلَمَ أَصَابَ ظَلْمًا: (T:) [and
ISd cites the verse above with the substitution of
بِعَينِهِ for بِطَرْفِهِ and of أَنَارَ for أَضَآءَ immediately
after saying that] أَظْلَمَ signifies he looked at the
teeth and saw lustre (الظَّلْمَ). (M.) [In the K,
next after the explanation of اظلم الثَّغْرُ given
above, it is added that اظلم said of a man signifies أَصَابَ ظَلْمًا: thus, with fet-h, to the ظ,
accord. to the TA: in my MS. copy of the K
and in the CK, ظُلْمًا, which is doubtless a mistranscription.]
5
تظلّم مِنْهُ CCC (T, S, M, K, [but in some copies
of the S, منه is omitted,]) He complained of his
ظُلْم [or wrongdoing, &c.], (S, M, K,) إِلَى الحَاكِمِ
[to the judge]: (T:) in some copies of the S,
تُظُلِّمَ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And تظلّم signifies also He
transferred the responsibility for the ظُلْم [or
wrongdoing, &c.,] upon himself, (M, K,) accord.
to IAar, who has cited as an ex.,
كَانَتْ إِذَا غَضِبَتْ عَلَىَّ تَظَلَّمَتْ
[as though meaning She used, when she was angry
with me, to transfer the responsibility for the
wrongdoing upon herself; which may mean that
she finally confessed the wrongdoing to be hers];
but [ISd says] I know not how that is: the
تَظَلُّم in this case is only the complaining of
الظُّلْم; for when she was angry with him, it
was not allowable [to say] that she attributed
the ظُلْم to herself. (M.) ―
-b3-  See also 1, former
half, in two places.
6
تظالم القَوْمُ (S, M, Msb) The people, or company of men, treated, or used, one another wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or tyrannically (ظَلَمَ
بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا). (M, Msb.) ―
-b2-  And [hence]
تَظَالَمَتِ المِعْزَى (tropical:)  The goats smote one another
with their horns by reason of their being fat and
having abundance of herbage. (IAar, M, TA.)
One says, وَجَدْنَا أَرْضًا تَظَالَمَ مِعْزَاهَا (tropical:)  We found a
land whereof the goats smote one another with
their horns by reason of satiety and liveliness.
(T, TA.)
7
إِنْظَلَمَ see the next paragraph.
8
اِظَّلَمَ (T, S, M, K) and اِظْطَلَمَ and اِطَّلَمَ,
(S, M,) which last is [said to be] the most usual,
(S,) [but I have mostly found the first to be used,]
of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ, (S, M,) He took upon himself [the bearing of] ظُلْم [or wrong, &c.,] in
spite of difficulty, trouble, or inconvenience: (S,
TA:) or he bore الظُّلْم [or wrong, &c.,] (T, M,
K, TA,) willingly, being able to resist; (T, TA;)
and ↓ اِنْظَلَمَ signifies [thus likewise, or] he bore
الظُّلْم. (S, M, K.)
ظَلْمٌ The lustre, and brightness, of gold. (Z,
TA.) ―
-b2-  And hence, (Z, TA,) The lustre (lit.
running water) upon the teeth; (Lth, T, Z, TA;)
the lustre (مَآء, S, M, K, and بَرِيق, S, K) of the
teeth, (Lth, T, S, M, Z, K, TA,) from the clearness of the colour, not from the saliva, (Lth, * T, *
M,) like blackness within the bone thereof, by reason
of the intense whiteness, (S, K,) resembling the فِرِنْد
[q. v.] of the sword, (S, K,) or appearing like the
فِرِنْد [of the sword], so that one imagines that there
is in it a blackness, by reason of the intense lustre
and clearness: (M:) or, accord. to Sh, whiteness
of the teeth, as though there were upon it [somewhat of] a blackness: or, as Abu-l-'Abbás ElAhwal says, in the Expos. of the “ Kaabeeyeh,”
lustre (lit. running water) of the teeth, such that
one sees upon it, by reason of its intense clearness
[app. meaning transparency], what resembles dustcolour and blackness: or, accord. to another explanation, fineness, or thinness, and intense whiteness,
of the teeth: (TA:) pl. ظُلُومٌ. (S, M.) ―
-b3-  Also
Snow: (M, K:) it is said to have this meaning:
and the phrase مُشْرَبَةِ الثَّنَايَا بِمَآءِ الظَّلْمِ, used by a
poet, may mean [Having the central teeth suffused
with the lustre termed ظَلْم, as is indicated in the
T and S, or] with the water of snow. (Lth, T.)
ظُلْمٌ [as a simple subst. generally means Wrong,
wrongdoing, injustice, injuriousness, or tyranny]:
see 1, first sentence, in two places. ―
-b2-  [ظُلْمُ
الارضِ in the CK is a mistranscription for ظَلَمَ
الأَرْضَ. ―
-b3-  And الظُلْمُ in one place in the CK,
as syn. with الظَّلْمَآءُ, is a mistake for الظُّلْمَةُ.]
لَقِيتُهُ أَدْنَى ظَلَمٍ, (S, M, K,) or أَدْنَى ذِى ظَلَمٍ,
(K, TA, [in the CK اَوَّلَ ذِى ظَلَمٍ,]) means (tropical:)  I
met him the first of everything: (S, K, TA:) or
the first thing: (M:) or when the darkness was
becoming confused: (M, K:) or أَدْنَى ظَلَمٍ means
near; (El-Umawee, S, M, K;) or nearness:
(M, K:) and one says, هُوَ مِنْكَ أَدْنَى ذِى ظَلَمٍ
[app. He is near thee], and رَأَيْتُهُ أَدْنَى ذِى ظَلَمٍ
[app. I saw him near]: (M:) and ظَلَمٌ is also
syn. with شَخْصٌ [as meaning an object seen from
a distance, or a person]; (K;) or, as some say,
it has this meaning in the phrase أَدْنَى ظَلَمٍ [so
that لَقِيتُهُ أَدْنَى ظَلَمٍ may mean I met him the
nearest object seen from a distance, or the nearest
person]: (M:) and accord. to Kh, one says,
↓ لَقِيتُهُ أَدْنَى ظُلْمَةٍ, or أَوَّلَ ذِى ظُلْمَةٍ, (as in different copies of the S,) meaning I met him the
first thing that obstructed my sight. (S.) ―
-b2-  ظَلَمٌ
signifies also A mountain: and the pl. is ظُلُومٌ.
(M, K.)
ظُلَمٌ an appellation of Three nights (T, S, K)
of the lunar month (T, S) next after the three
called دُرَعٌ; (T, S, * K; *) so says A'Obeyd: (T:)
thus called because of their darkness: (S:) the
sing. is ↓ ظَلْمَآءُ; (T, S;) so that it is anomalous;
for by rule it should be ظُلْمٌ; (S;) and the sing.
of دُرَعٌ is دَرْعَآءُ: so says A'Obeyd: but accord. to
AHeyth and Mbr, the sings. are ↓ ظُلْمَةٌ and
دُرْعَةٌ, agreeably with rule; and this is the correct
assertion. (T. [See more in art. درع, voce أَدْرَعُ.])
ظِلَمٌ: see ظِلَّامٌ.
ظُلْمَةٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and ↓ ظُلُمَةٌ (S, M, K)
[accord. to the CK ظُلْمٌ and ظُلُمٌ, both of which
are wrong,] and ↓ ظَلْمَآءُ (S, M, Msb, K) Darkness; contr. of نُورٌ: (S, Msb:) or nonexistence of
نُور [or light]: or an accidental state that precludes
the coëxistence therewith of نُور: (Er-Rághib,
TA:) or the departure of light; as also ↓ ظَلَامٌ;
(M, K;) which last has no pl.; (T, TA;) or
this last signifies the beginning, or first part, of
night, (S, M, Msb,) even though it be one in which
the moon shines; and is said by Sb to be used
only adverbially; one says, أَتَيْتُهُ ظَلَامًا, meaning
I came to him at night, and مَعَ الظَّلَامِ i. e. at
the time of the night: (M, TA:) the pl. of ظُلْمَةٌ
is ظُلَمٌ and ظُلُمَاتٌ and ظُلَمَاتٌ (T, S, Msb) and
ظُلْمَاتٌ, (S, Msb,) or, accord. to IB, the first of
these pls. is of ظُلْمَةٌ and the second is of ظُلُمَةٌ.
(TA.) One says, ↓ هُوَ يَخْبِطُ الظَّلَامَ [or فِى الظَّلَامِ,
expl. in art. خبط], and الظُّلْمَةَ [which means the
same] and ↓ الظَّلْمَآءَ [which is also expl. in art.
خبط]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  ظُلْمَةٌ is also [tropically] used
as a term for (assumed tropical:)  Ignorance: and (assumed tropical:)  belief in a
plurality of gods: and (assumed tropical:)  transgression, or unrighteousness: like as نُورٌ is used as a term for
their contraries: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and it is
said in the A that الظُّلْمُ is ظُلْمَةٌ, like as العَدْلُ
is نُورٌ. (TA.) ظُلُمَاتُ البَحْرِ means (assumed tropical:)  The troubles,
afflictions, calamities, or hardships, of the sea.
(M.)
-A2-  And one says لَيْلَةٌ ظُلْمَةٌ, [using the
latter word as an epithet, (in the CK, erroneously, ظَلِمَةٌ,)] and ↓ لَيْلَةٌ ظَلْمَآءُ, both meaning
A night intensely dark; (M, K;) or the latter
means مُظْلِمَةٌ [i. e. dark, or black]: (S:) and
↓ لَيْلٌ ظَلْمَآءُ also, (M, K,) which is anomalous,
(K,) mentioned by IAar, but [ISd says] this is
strange, and in my opinion he has put لَيْلٌ in the
place of لَيْلَةٌ, as in his mentioning لَيْلٌ قَمْرَآءُ [q. v.].
(M.) ―
-b2-  See also ظُلَمٌ: ―

weight or worth: ―

ظِلَامًا, meaning شَزْرًا [i. e. He looked at me from
the outer angle of the eye, with anger, or aversion]. (K.)

and the extracting of its butter: see ظَلَمَ الوَطْبَ,
and what follows it, in the first paragraph]. (M.)
ظَلِيمٌ [as syn. with مَظْلُومٌ in the primary
sense of the latter I have not found: but as an
epithet in which the quality of a subst. predominates it signifies] (tropical:)  Milk that is drunk before
its becoming thick and its butter's coming forth or
being extracted; (S, * M;) as also ↓ ظَلِيمَةٌ, (T,
S, M,) and ↓ مَظْلُومٌ. (T, S.) ―

[it]. (M.) ―

↓ مَظْلُومَة (S, K, TA) i. e. dug, (TA,) or dug for

-A2-  Also The male ostrich: (T, S, M,
K:) said (by IDrd, TA) to be so called because
he makes a place for the laying and hatching of
the eggs (يُدَحِّى, inf. n. تَدْحِيَةٌ,) where the doing
so is not proper: (M, TA:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib and others, because he is believed to be
deaf: (TA:) pl. ظِلْمَانٌ (T, M, K) and ظُلْمَانٌ
(M, K) and أَظْلِمَةٌ, (T, M,) which last is a pl. of

λ and
μ, above the
nine stars called النَّعَائِم, or “ the ostriches ”].
(Kzw in his descr. of Sagittarius.) And الظَّلِيمُ
is the name of The bright star [
α] at the
end of النَّهْر [i. e. Eridanus]: and A star upon
the mouth of الحُوت [i. e. Piscis Australis]
(Kzw in his descr. of Eridanus.) [It seems to
be implied in the K that الظَّلِيمُ is the name of
two stars; or it may be there meant that each of
two stars is thus called. Freytag represents the
sing. as “ a name of stars,” and the dual also as
“ a name of stars; ” referring, in relation to the
former, to Ideler's “ Untersuch,” pp. 201, 228,
and 233; and in relation to the latter, to the
same work, pp. 106 and 184.]
