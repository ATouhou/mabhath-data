ظبى5
تظبّى, if used, means He acted like the
ظَبْى, or gazelle; being similar to تَذَأَّبَ and تَنَمَّرَ
&c.: its part. n. is mentioned in the first paragraph of art. ربض.]
ظَبْىٌ A certain animal, (TA,) well known;
(S, Msb, K, TA;) the غَزَال [or gazelle; to which
the former word is applied when used unrestrictedly, and which is app. here meant by the
latter word, though this seems properly to signify
“ a young gazelle ”]; (M;) [it is the gazella
dorcas, also called antilope dorcas, of which the
ariel, or antilope Arabica, is said to be a variety;
or, accord. to some, each is a distinct species of
gazelle: the name seems to be properly, but not
always (as is shown by an explanation of رِئْمٌ),
applied only to the true antelope of Arabia and
adjacent countries, as distinguished from the cervine and bovine antelopes:] it is a name for the
male; which is also called تَيْسٌ, when he has
become what is termed a ثَنِىّ [q. v.], which he
continues to be termed until he dies: (AHát,
Msb, TA:) the female is called ظَبْيَةٌ, (AHát,
T, M, Msb, K, TA,) and عَنْزٌ and مَاعِزَةٌ: (AHát,
Msb, TA:) the dual is ظَبْيَانِ: (Msb, TA:) and
the pl. is أَظْبٍ, (S, M, Msb, K,) originally أَظْبُىٌ,
(S, Msb,) a pl. of pauc., (S,) and ظُبِىٌّ and ظِبَآءُ,
(S, M, Msb, K,) which last is of the masc. and
fem., (M, Msb,) and ظَبَيَاتٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,)
which is of the fem. (M, Msb.) One says, بِهِ
دَآءُ ظَبْىٍ [lit. In him is the disease of a gazelle];
meaning in him is no disease; as there is [said to
be] no disease in the ظبى. (AA, T.) And لَكَ
عِنْدِى مِائَةٌ سِنَّ الظَّبْىِ [To thee I owe a hundred
camels of the age of the gazelle], i. e., all of them
ثُنْيَان [pl. of ثَنِىٌّ, q. v.], because the ظبى does
not exceed what is termed إِثْنَآءٌ. (M.) [See also
a verse cited voce سِنٌّ; in which the phrase
فَجَآءَتْ كَسِنِّ الظَّبْىِ means And they came; like
the age of the gazelle was the age of every one of
them.] It is said in a prov., ↓ لَأَتْرُكَنَّهُ تَرْكَ ظُبَىٍّ
ظِلَّهُ [I will assuredly forsake him as a little gazelle
forsakes the place of its shade]; because the ظبى,
when it leaves its covert, does not return to it: it
is said in confirming the relinquishing of anything.
(T. [See ظِلٌّ, where other relations of this prov.
are mentioned.]) And in another prov., الظِّبَآءَ
عَلَى البَقَرِ, said when the tie of relationship and
friendship between two men is severed, and it
was used in the Time of Ignorance as a form of
divorce: الظباء is in the accus. case by reason of
اِخْتَرْتُ, or اِخْتَارَ, understood, [so that the meaning
is I have preferred, or he has preferred, the
gazelles to the wild cows,] by the بقر being meant
the women: whence the saying, جَآءَ يَجُرُّ بَقَرَهُ
[expl. in art. بقر]. (Meyd. [See also Freytag's
Arab. Prov. ii. 61.]) And one says, أَتَيْتُهُ حِينَ
شَدَّ الظَّبْىَ ظِلُّهُ i. e. [I came to him when its shade]
confined the ظبى [or gazelle] by reason of the
vehemence of the heat: or, as some relate it,
حِينْ نَشَدَ الظَّبْىُ ظِلَّهُ, meaning طَلَبَهُ [i. e., when
the gazelle sought its shade]. (TA.) And it is
said in a trad., إِذَا أَتَيْتَهُمْ فَارْبِضْ فِى دَارِهِمْ ظَبْيًا
[expl. voce رَبَضَ]. (T, TA.) بِهِ لَا بِظَبْىٍ, (S,
TA,) or بِهِ لَا بِظَبْىٍ أَعْفَرَ, a prov., meaning May
this accident befall him, (لِيَنْزِلْ بِهِ هٰذِهِ الحَادِثَةُ,)
not a white antelope, (Meyd,) is said on an occasion of rejoicing at another's affliction, (S, Meyd,
TA,) by way of imprecation, i. e. may God make
that which has befallen him to cleave to him. (S,
TA. [See also Freytag's Arab. Prov. i. 148.])
