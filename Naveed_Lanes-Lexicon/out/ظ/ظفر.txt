أَظْفَرَ see the next preceding paragraph, latter
part, in two places.

تظافروا عَلَيْهِ and
تضافروا and تظاهروا all
signify the same; so says Ibn-Buzurj; (T, TA;)
explaining the meaning to be, They leagued together, and aided one another, against him; i. e.
عَلَى فُلَانٍ [against such a one]: (TA in art.
ضفر:) the first of these has been said to be incorrect; but it is mentioned also by Sgh, as syn.
with the third; and by Ibn-Málik, among words
that are with ض and with ظ. (TA in the
present art.)

إِظْتَفَرَ see 2, in three places:
-A2-  and see also 1, in
two places.
ظَفْرٌ: see the next paragraph.
ظُفْرٌ (T, S, M, A, Msb, K, &c.) and ↓ ظُفُرٌ,
(Msb, K,) which latter is the most chaste form,
and the form adopted by the seven readers in the
Kur vi. 147, and the former is a contraction of
this, [but is the most common form,] (Msb,) and
↓ ظِفْرٌ, which is extr., (M, Msb, K,) and disallowed by IDrd, (O,) and ↓ ظِفِرٌ, which is also
extr., (Msb,) and ↓ أُظْفُورٌ, (T, M, A, Msb, K,)
which is erroneously mentioned in the S as a pl.
of ظُفْرٌ, (Sgh, Msb, K,) by an anticipation of the
pen; (Msb;) or, accord. to MF, it si said in
most of the copies of the S, (but this is not the
case,) ظُفْرٌ has for its pl. أَظْفَارٌ; and أُظْفُورٌ [has
for its pl.] أَظَافِيرُ; (TA;) [and this, being the
reading in most of the copies of the S seen by
MF, is probably what J wrote;] A certain wellknown thing; (M;) [i. e. a nail; and a talon,
or claw;] pertaining to a human being, (M, Ibn-Es-Seed, Msb, K,) and to others; (M, K;) to
the beasts and birds mentioned in the next following sentence, [as well as to man,] accord. to the
authorities there cited; (TA;) and to every
ruminant, as syn. with ظِلْفٌ [i. e. a cloven hoof]:
(T and M in art. ظلف:) or to a beast, or bird,
that does not prey; [as well as to man;] that of
such as preys being termed مِخْلَبٌ: (M:) [and
in the present day applied also to the spur of a
cock:] it is of the masc. gender: (Lh, M, Msb:)
the pl. (of ظُفْرٌ, S, M, Msb, &c.) is أَظْفَارٌ (S, M,
Msb, K, &c.) and sometimes أَظْفُرٌ, (Msb,) [both
of which are pls. of pauc., but the former is used
as a pl. of mult. also,]. and (of أُظْفُورٌ, M, Msb, or
of أَظْفَارٌ, and therefore a pl. pl., M) أَظَافِيرُ: (M,
Msb, K:) that ↓ أُظْفُورٌ is a sing. [and not like
أُبْقُورٌ which is a quasi-pl. n.] is shown by the
saying of a poet,
مَا بَيْنَ لُقْمَتِهَا الأُولَى إِذَا انْحَدَرَتْ
وَبَيْنَ أُخْرَى تَلِيهَا قِيسُ أُظْفُورِ
(K) or قِيدُ أُظْفُورِ (Msb) [i. e. What is between
her first morsel, when it descends into her throat,
and another that follows it, is the measure of a
finger-nail]: or, as some relate it, إِذَا ازْدَرَدَتْ
[when she swallows]; and it is thus cited [in the
T and] in the “ Basáïr ” of the author of the K.
(TA.) The phrase كُلَّ ذِى ظُفُرٍ in the Kur
vi. 147 comprises camels and ostriches; (so in
the T and TS and L; but in the K, الأَنْعَام is
erroneously put for النَّعَام; TA;) because their
مَنَاسِم are like أَظْفَار to them: (T, K, TA:) I'Ab
says that it comprises camels; and also ostriches,
because they have nails like camels: or any bird
that has a مِخْلَب, and any beast that has a solid
hoof: or, accord. to Mujáhid and Katádeh, every
beast and bird that has not divided toes; as the
camel and ostrich and goose and duck. (TA.)
―
-b2-  [Hence,] الأَظْفَارُ is the name of (assumed tropical:)  Certain
small stars; (S;) certain stars before النَّسْر
[meaning النَّسْر الوَاقِع i. e. the star a of Lyra:
app. because regarded as the talons of the نسر]:
(K:) or a certain dim star in الشَّلْيَاق [q. v., i. e.
the constellation Lyra]. (Kzw.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also,]
إِنَّهُ لَكَلِيلُ الظُّفْرِ, (T,) or إِنَّهُ لَمَقْلُومُ الظُّفْرِ, (TA,)
(tropical:)  Verily he is one who does not slay or wound an
enemy: (T, TA:) and إِنَّهُ مَقْلُومُ الظُّفْرِ عَنْ أَذَى
النَّاسِ (tropical:)  Verily he is one who does little hurt to
mankind. (T, A, TA.) And هُوَ كَلِيلُ الظُّفْرِ
(tropical:)  He is weak, or abject, or despicable; (T, S, K,
TA;) said of a man; (K, TA;) or so مُقَلَّمُ الظُّفْرِ:
(K: [in the TA, as from the K, مُقَلَّمُ الأَظْفَارِ:])
or (tropical:)  he is sick, or diseased. (A.) And بِهِ ظُفْرٌ مِنْ
مَرَضٍ (tropical:)  [app. meaning In him is an evil result of
a disease, that has clung to him]. (A, TA.
[In the A, this immediately follows what here
next precedes it; and is immediately followed by
the words وَذُبَابٌ ظَفِرَ مِنْهُ, which seem to be added
by way of explanation; thus in my copy; but I
think that ظَفِرَ مِنْهُ here is a mistake for ظَفَّرَ فِيهِ,
and have assumed this to be the case in rendering
the phrase.]) ―
-b4-  And قَرَّحْتُهُ مِنْ ظُفْرِهِ إِلَى شُفْرِهِ
(tropical:)  [lit. I wounded him much, from his nail to the
edge of his eyelid; but mentioned as tropical;
app. meaning from toe to head]; like as one says,
مِنْ قَرْنِهِ. (A.) ―
-b5-  And مَا بَالدَّارِ ظُفْرٌ, (K,) or
ما بالدار ظُفْرٌ وَلَا شُفْرٌ, (A, O,) (tropical:)  There is not in
the house any one. (A, O, K.) And مَا تَرَكَتِ
السَّنَةُ ظُفْرًا وَلَا شُفْرًا (tropical:)  The year of drought left not
anything: and sometimes they said شَفْرًا, with
fet-h, and in this case they said ↓ ظَفْرًا, for assimilation. (A in art. شفر.) And رَأَيْتُهُ بِظُفْرِهِ (tropical:)  I
saw him himself. (O, K, TA.) ―
-b6-  ظُفْرُ النَّسْرِ is the
name of (assumed tropical:)  A certain plant, (K, TA,) resembling
what is [properly] thus termed [i. e. the talon of
the vulture]. (TA.) And ظُفْرُ القِطِّ is the name
of (assumed tropical:)  Another plant. (K, TA.) ―
-b7-  And الظُّفْرُ,
(M,) or الأَظْفَارُ, (T, M, A, Mgh, O, K, &c.,) for
this word in the sense here following has no sing.
(T, M, O, K) accord. to the author of the 'Eyn,
(M,) but sometimes one said وَاحِدَةٌ ↓ أَظْفَارَةٌ,
which is not allowable by rule, and made the pl.
of this to be أَظَافِيرُ, (T, O, K, * [mentioned in the
M as a pl. of الظُّفْرُ,]) though, if they formed a
sing. from it, it should be ظُفْرٌ, (T, O, K,) signifies (tropical:)  A certain odoriferous substance, (T, Mgh,
O, K,) or a sort thereof, (M,) [i. e. unguis odoratus, (called in the present day ظُفْرُ الطِّيبِ and
ظُفْرُ العِفْرِيتِ,) or ungues odorati,] black, (T, M,
O,) resembling a ظُفْر [or nail] (T, M, Mgh, O,
K) of a man (M) pulled out (in the M and O
and K مُقْتُلَف, and in the T مُقَلَّف,) from the
root thereof, (T, M, O, K, [but in the M, the
words which I have rendered “ pulled out ” &c.
immediately follow the words ضَرْبٌ مِنَ العِطْرِ
أَسْوَدُ,]) or resembling the أَظْفَار [or finger-nails],
(A,) and put into دُخْتَة [or incense]: (T, M, O:)
and, accord. to the K, ↓ ظَفَارٌ, sometimes imperfectly decl., i. e. ↓ ظَفَارُ, signifies the same; but
this is very strange, for [SM says] I have referred
to the M and T and O and other lexicons without
finding them to have mentioned in this sense any
term but الأَظْفَارُ or الظُّفْرُ: accord. to the “ Minháj,” أَظْفَارُ الطِّيبِ are pieces of an odoriferous
substance resembling the أَظْفَار [properly so called];
they are said by [the Arabic translator of] Dioscorides to be of the nature of the shards of shells,
[so I render مِنْ جِنْسِ أَخْزَافِ الصَّدَفِ, supposing
اخزاف to be here used tropically,] found in an
island of the Sea of India where is the سُنْبُل [or
spikenard], a sort whereof is [called] قُلْزُمِىّ [i. e.
of El-Kulzum], and another which is [called]
بَابِلِىّ [i. e. of Bábil], black and small, and the
best is that which inclines to whiteness, which
drifts to El-Yemen and El-Bahreyn. (TA.)
[Forskål, in his “ Descr. Animalium ” &c., mentions what here follows, among the animal substances of the materia medica of Cairo, in page
143: “ Unguis odoratus. (Opercula Cochl.) Dofr
el afrît, ضفر العفريت i. e. unguis dæmonis. E
Mochha per Sués. Arabes etiam afferunt. Nigritis fumigatorium est. ” (ضفر is here written,
agreeably with the usual vulgar pronunciation,
for ظُفْر.) See also قُسْطٌ,] ―
-b8-  أَظْفَارٌ signifies also
(assumed tropical:)  Large قِرْدَان [or ticks]. (S, O, K.) ―
-b9-  And
(assumed tropical:)  The creased parts of a skin. (M, TA.) ―
-b10-  And
the ظُفْر of a bow is (tropical:)  The part in the curved end
that is beyond the place where the string is tied,
to the extremity: (As, T, S, M, * O, K: *) or the
end of the bow: (K:) or each end of the bow,
beyond the place where the string is tied: (A:)

is termed a ظَفَرَة; (T, M, A, K;) as also ↓ مَظْفُورَةٌ.
(A.)
-A2-  Also [Successful;] victorious; applied to
a man; (S;) and so ↓ ظَافِرٌ: (Msb, TA:) or
ظَفِرٌ (IDrd, M, A, K) and ↓ ظَفِيرٌ (IDrd, M, K)
and ↓ ظِفِّيرٌ, (IDrd, Sgh, K) but this is said by
IDrd to be not of established authority, (TA,)
and ↓ مُظَفَّرٌ (IDrd, M, A, K) and ↓ مِظْفَارٌ,
(IDrd, O, K,) all signify a man very, or often,
successful or victorious: (IDrd, O, TA:) or (tropical:)  one
who does not endeavour after a thing without attaining it. (M, A, K.)
ظُفُرٌ and ظِفِرٌ: see ظُفْرٌ.

it is cut off: if left, it covers the eye, and obscures the sight: (T:) or a certain disease in the
eye, which causes a tegument like the nail to come
over it: or a piece of flesh that grows at the inner
angle of the eye, extending to the black, and sometimes encroaching upon the black: (M:) it is
also called ↓ ظُفْرٌ (A 'Obeyd, T, S, M, Mgh, O,
K) and ↓ ظُفْرَةٌ, (T, Mgh,) these two terms being
applied to it by the physicians, (Mgh,) and
↓ ظَفَرٌ (TA) and ↓ ظِفَارَةٌ, (so in a copy of the T,
as on the authority of Ibn-Buzurj,) or ↓ ظَفَارَةٌ.
(So in the O.)
ظَفَارٌ and ظَفَارُ: see ظُفْرٌ.
-A2-  [ظَفَارِ is well
known as the name of a city in El-Yemen; or,
accord. to the O, of two cities and two fortresses
in El-Yemen. And accord. to the TA, it signifies Any land that is ذات مَعَزَّة: but the latter of
these two words has been altered by an erasure
over the second letter, and is perhaps incorrect:
if not, it may mean, agreeably with the analogy
of many words of the measure مَفْعَلَةٌ, as مَقْدَرَةٌ
and مَفْلَحَةٌ and مَنْجَاةٌ &c., such as possesses
means of overcoming, or withstanding, invaders:
and it may be that hence ظَفَارِ is in two instances
the name of a fortress.]
