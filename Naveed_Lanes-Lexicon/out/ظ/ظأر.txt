(M,) aor.
ظَاَ^َ, (M, K,) inf. n. ظَأْرٌ (S, M, K) and
ظِئْارٌ, (M, K,) He made her (a camel, S, Mgh)
to incline to, or to affect, a young one not her
own, (S, M, Mgh, K,) and to suckle it; (M, K;)
as also ↓ أَظْأَرَهَا, and ↓ ظَآءَرَهَا: (K:) and [it is also
said that] ظِئَارٌ signifies the making a she-camel to
incline to, or to affect, and suckle, the young one
of another, by the application of a غِمَامَة in her
nose, (S, * K, * TA,) i. e. by stopping her nose, and
also her eyes, (TA,) and by the insertion of a دُرْجَة
[q. v.] composed of rags into her vulva, (رَحِم, T,
TA, or حَيَآء, S), and closing its [i. e. the vulva's]
edges by means of two pointed pieces of wood stuck
through, and putting upon her a غِمَامَة covering
her head, and leaving her in this state until it
distresses her, (T, TA,) and she imagines herself
to be in labour; (TA;) when the درجة is pulled
out from her vulva (حَيَآء), and the young one of
another is brought near to her, having its head
and skin bedaubed with what has come forth with
the درجة from the lower part of the vulva; (T, *
TA;) then they open her nose and her eyes; (TA;)
and when she sees and smells the young one, she
imagines that she has brought it forth, and yields
it milk: moreover, when the درجة is inserted, the
space between the two edges of her vulva is closed
by a thong [passed round the extremities of the
two pointed pieces of wood]. (T, TA.) It is said
in a trad., of 'Omar, (T,) or Ibn-'Omar, (S, TA,)
that he purchased a she-camel, and, seeing in her
the laceration on the occasion of ظِئْار, returned
her. (T, S, * TA.) ―

or to entice me, to do the thing; (M, K, TA;) it
not being in my mind: (TA:) or he compelled me
to do the thing, against my will; (K, TA;) I
having refused to do it. (TA.) It is said in a
prov., الطَّعْنُ يَظْأَرُ, meaning, Thrusting, or
piercing, with the spear inclines [one's enemies]
to peace: (As, T, A, K:) J says يَظْأَرُهُ, as also
IKtt, which F disapproves; but others approve
it: or the reading of the S is ↓ يُظْئِرُهُ. (TA.)
The Arabs also said, الطَّعْنُ ظِئَارُ قَوْمٍ (M, K)
Thrusting, or piercing, with the spear is a means
of inclining a people to peace; (K;) meaning,
make people to fear, that they may love thee.
(M, K.) It is also said, in a trad. of 'Alee,
أَظْأَرُكُمْ إِلَى الحَقِّ وَأَنْتُمْ تَفِرُّونَ مِنْهُ, [perhaps a
mistake for على الحقّ,] I incline you [or I
endeavour to turn you] to the truth, and ye flee
from it. (TA.)

(T, M, K; in one copy of the K اِظْآرَّتْ;) She
