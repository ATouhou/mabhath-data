He feigned himself stupid after feigning himself
intelligent: (K, TA:) accord. to some copies,
after feigning himself negligent, or inadvertent:
(تَغَافُل being put in the place of تَعَاقُل:) [app.

old وعل: (S, M, Mgh, K:) or the male of the
أَرْوَى: (Sh, T, M, K: [this is the same as the
first explanation:]) En-Nadr says that it has
small horns: (T:) Aboo-Kheyreh, that it is of
the وُعُول, does not quit the mountain, and its
horns have branches: (T, Mgh: *) he says that
the وعول are dusky, or dingy, or of a hue inclining
to black and dust-colour, with whiteness in their
lower parts; and the ثَيَاتِل [pl. of ثَيْتَل] are like
them in their colours, and only distinguished from
them by the horns; the وعل having long horns,
which extend backwards until they meet over his
tail: (T:) also a species of [the bovine antelope
called] بَقَرُ الوَحْشِ, (M, K,) that abides in the
mountains. (M.) ―
