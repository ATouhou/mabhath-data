تَثْرِيبٌ, in its primary sense, is The removing
of the ثَرْب, i. e., the fat that forms the integument
of the stomach of a ruminant: so says Z. (Har
p. 197.) ―
-b2-  And hence, (tropical:)  The act of blaming;
reproving; and punishing, or chastising, for an
offence, or a crime: (Har ubi suprà:) or (tropical:)  severe
blaming or reproving, that rends reputations,
and takes away the brightness of countenances:
(Z in Har ubi suprá:) which last meaning it has
in the Kur xii. 92: (Bd:) or لَا تَثْرِيبَ عَلَيْكُمْ
there means (assumed tropical:)  No evil, or mischief, shall come upon
you: (Zj, T:) or (assumed tropical:)  your offences, or crimes, shall
not be mentioned: (Th, M:) تثريب signifies (assumed tropical:)  the
act of blaming, or reproving; (S, Mgh;) or doing
so severely, or angrily; or, with the utmost severity or harshness: the act of upbraiding, or reproaching: and the going to the utmost length in
blaming or reproving: one says, لَا تَثْرِيبَ عَلَيْكَ
(assumed tropical:)  [No blame, &c., shall be laid on thee]: and it is
from الثَّرْبُ [as explained above]. (S.) You say,
ثرّب and ↓ ثَرَبَ and ↓ اثرب, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He blamed,
or reproved; or did so severely, or with the utmost
severity; or reproached, or upbraided: (T:) and
ثرّب عَلَيْهِ, (S, M, K,) and ثّربهُ; (A, K;) and
↓ ثَرَبَهُ, [and ثَرَبَ عليه,] aor.
ثَرِبَ, (K,) inf. n. ثَرْبٌ;
(TK;) and ↓ اثربهُ; (A, K;) (assumed tropical:)  he blamed him, or
reproved him; upbraided him, or reproached
him, (M, A, K,) with, or for, his offence, or
crime; (M, K;) and reminded him thereof;
(M;) he showed him his deed to be foul, abominable, or bad: (As, S:) or عليه ↓ ثَرَبَ, aor.
ثَرِبَ,
signifies (assumed tropical:)  he blamed him, or reproved him; and,
as Suh says, ثرّب عليه, (assumed tropical:)  he blamed him, or reproved him, much. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The acting
ill, or corruptly; doing evil, or mischief; creating
confusion, or disorder. (TA.)
-A2-  It is also said
in the K to be syn. with طَىٌّ, which means The
building [or casing a well] with stones: but [SM
says,] I fear that this is a mistranscription for
تَثْوِيبٌ, with و. (TA.)

أَثْرَبَ He (a ram) increased in his fatness: (K:)
or acquired a ثَرْب, having increased in fatness.
(TA.)
-A2-  See also 2, in two places.
ثَرْبٌ A thin integument of fat that covers the
stomach of a ruminant and the bowels or intestines; (Lth, T, S, M, Msb, K;) the fat that is
spread over the bowels, or intestines: (T:) pl. (of
mult., TA) ثُرُوبٌ (M, K) and (of pauc., TA)
أَثْرُبٌ, and pl. pl. أَثَارِبُ. (K.) Hence, صَارَتِ
الشَّمْسُ كَالْأَثَارِبِ The sun [upon the ground] became like the integuments above-mentioned: i. e.,
scattered; being upon one place and not upon
another, towards sunset: a phrase occurring in a
trad., in which it is said that when this is the
case, it is forbidden to perform the afternoonprayer: and in another trad. occurs the phrase,
صَارَتِ الشَّمْسُ كَثَرْبِ النَّاقَةِ [The sun upon the
ground became like the ثرب of the she-camel].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And [hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A land of which the
stones are such as those of the حَرَّة [q. v.], save
that they are white. (L.)
