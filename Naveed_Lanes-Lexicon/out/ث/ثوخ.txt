ثوخ1
ثَاخَ and
سَاخَ both signify He, or it, sank

in the former is a substitute for the س in the
latter. (L, TA.) You say, ثَاخَتْ قَدَمُهُ بِالوَحْلِ,

foot sank, or entered, into the mire. (S, L.) And
ثَاخَتِ الإِصْبَعُ, aor. as above, (L, K,) inf. n. ثَوْخٌ,
(L,) The finger entered, or sank, into a swollen,
or tumid, or a soft, or yielding, substance; (L,
K;) as also سَاخَت, (L,) and تَاخَت: (Lth:) but
this last is disapproved by IDrd, and J and others
do not mention it. (TA in art. توخ.)
