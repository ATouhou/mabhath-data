―
-b2-  أَثْرَتِ الأَرْضُ The land, or earth, had much
moisture; became abundant in moisture: (S, M,
Msb, K:) or it became compact with moisture.
(AHn, M.) [See also مُثْرٍ.]
ثَرًى Moisture; humidity; (S, M, K;) of the
earth: (S, Msb:) and moist earth; (S, M, Msb,
K;) تُرَاب that is not moist is not called ثَرًى;
(Msb;) or such as, when moistened, does not
become cohesive mud or clay; (M, K;) as also
↓ ثَرْيَآءُ [an epithet used as a subst.]: (AO, T, *
K, TA: [in the CK, erroneously, ثَرَياء:]) and
the earth;; (M, K) مَا تَحْتَ الثَّرَي, in the Kur
[xx. 5], being explained as meaning what is beneath
the earth: (M:) الثَّرَى and * أَثْرَى both signify
the earth; and the latter, being thus used as a
proper name, is imperfectly decl.: (Ham p. 351:)
dual ثَرَيَانِ (S, M, K) and ثَرَوَانِ: (Lh, M, K:
[but the sing. of the latter should be written ثَرًا:])
pl. أَثْرَآْ. (M, K.) اِلْتَقَى الثَّرَيَانِ [The two moistures met, or have met,] is said when the rain has
sunk into the ground so that it has met the moisture of the earth. (S, M, K.) Accord. to IAar, it
was also said by a man, (M,) or by an Arab of the
desert, (K,) who, (M, K,) being naked, (K,) clad
himself with a fur-garment, (M, K,) without a shirt;
(M;) meaning the hair of the pubes and the soft
hair of the fur-garment. (M, K.) And the Arabs
say, شَهْرٌ ثَرَى وَشَهْرٌ تَرَى وَشَهْرٌ مَرْعَى وَشَهْرٌ اسْتَوَى,
meaning A month [of moisture] in which the rain
begins, and sinks into the ground, and moistens
and softens the earth; for شَهْرٌ ذُو ثَرًى: and a
month in which thou seest the heads of the herbage
grown forth; for شَهْرٌ تَرَى فِيهِ رُؤُوسَ النَّبَاتِ: and
a month in which the herbage is tall enough to
be pastured upon by the cattle: (As, S, * M:)
and a month in which it is full-grown and erect.
(As, M.) One says also, بَدَا ثَرَى المَآءِ مِنَ الفَرَسِ,
meaning The sweat of the horse appeared. (S, *
M.) And إِنِّى لَأَرَي ثَرَى الغَضَبِ فِى وَجْهِ فُلَانٍ,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Verily I see the effect of anger in the
face of such a one. (T.) And هُوَابْنُ ثَرَاهَا (assumed tropical:)  He
is the knowing with respect to it. (T in art. بنى.)
―
-b2-  [Hence, as being likened to moist earth,] i. q.
خَيْرٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Good; anything good; &c.]. (M, K. [For
خَيْر, Golius appears to have found, in a copy of
the K, حَيْز; and this, which he has rendered
“Terræ tractus,” he has given as a signification,
not of ثَرًى, but of ثَرَآءٌ, which, like ثَرًى, he also
explains as meaning “ terra. ” ]) So in the saying,
فُلَانٌ قَرِيبُ الثَّرَى [app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one
is a person from whom good is easy of attainment: or it may mean, a person from whom good
seems to be easy of attainment: in either case
likened to land of which the moist earth is near
the surface: that the phrase may have the latter
meaning appears from what here follows]. (M.)
You say, إِنَّ فُلَانًا لَقَرِيبُ الثَّرِى بَعِيدُ النَّبَطِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Verily such a one is a person who promises
but who does not fulfil. (IAar, T.) ―
-b3-  [Hence
also, (assumed tropical:)  Fresh and vigorous friendship.] You say,
لَمْ يَبْبَسِ الثَّرَى بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [The fresh and
vigorous friendship between me and him has not
withered]: whence the phrase, مَا بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَ فُلَانٍ
* مُثْرٍ (assumed tropical:)  [That friendship which is between me and
such a one is fresh and vigorous]; i. e., it has not
ceased, or become severed. (S, * M.) Jereer says,
فَلَا تُوبِسُوا بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمُ الثَّرَى
↓ فَإِنَّ الَّذَي بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمُ مُثْرِى
[And wither not the fresh and vigorous friendship
between me and you; for that which is between
me and you is fresh and vigorous]. (S, M.)
[
ثَرٍ, fem. ثَرِيَةٌ, Moist; humid.] You say أَرْضٌ
ثَرِيَةٌ, (M, Msb,) like عَمِيَةٌ, (Msb,) or ↓ ثَرِيَّةٌ, like
غَنِيَّةٌ, (K, [but this is anomalous, as part. n. of
ثَرِيَت,]) and ↓ ثَرْيَآءُ, (Msb, K,) Earth, or land,
that has become moist and soft, after drought
and dryness: (M, K:) or watered by rain that
has penetrated to its moistness: (Msb:) or the
last, land of just, or moderate, moisture: (AHn,
M:) or moist land; (T, S, M;) and so the first.
(M.) And ↓ مَكَانٌ ثَرْيَانُ A place of which the
earth has in it moisture. (TA.) And ↓ يَوْمٌ ثَرِىٌّ
A humid day. (TA.)
