ثغر1
ثَغَرَهُ, (T, A, K,) aor.
ثَغَرَ, (K,) inf. n. ثَغْرٌ,
(T,) He broke it; (T, A;) namely, a part of a
wall; (A;) he demolished it: this is [said to be]
the primary signification: he demolished it, or
pulled it down; namely, a wall: (T:) and he
broke it (namely, anything, [as a wall and a
vessel, &c.,] A) so as to make a gap in it, or a
hollow in its edge. (A, K.) ―
-b2-  Also, (IAar, S,
Msb, K,) aor. as above, (Msb, K,) He broke his
ثَغْر [or front teeth], (S, Msb, K,) or his teeth.
(IAar, and TA as from the K.) And ثُغِرَ, in the
pass. form, inf. n. ثُغُورٌ, He (a boy) had his ثَغْر
[or front teeth] broken. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  ثَغَرْتُ سِنَّهُ I
pulled out his tooth. (El-Hujeymee, TA.) And

inf. n. ثَغْرٌ, (AZ, Msb,) He (a boy) shed his central milk-teeth, (AZ, S, Mgh, K,) or his ثَغْر [or
front teeth]: (AZ, Msb:) or ↓ أَثْغَرَ has this latter
meaning, (A, K,) or ↓ اِتَّغَرَ; (As, TA;) and ثَغِرَ,
(K,) or ↓ اِتَّغَرَ, (Sh, TA,) or ↓ اِتَّغَرَ, (Msb,) signifies he shed his teeth: (Sh, Msb, K:) ثُغِرَ is said
to have this last signification in the Kifáyet el-Mutahaffidh; and ↓ اثّغر and ↓ اتّغر are there said
to have the contr. signification, explained below
[see 8]. (Msb.) ―
-b5-  ثُغِرَ also signifies He had his
mouth bruised; and so ↓ أُثْغِرَ. (K.)
-A2-  ثَغَرَ الثُّلْمَةَ,
aor.
ثَغَرَ, He stopped up, or obstructed, the gap, or
breach: thus the verb bears two contr. significations. (K.) And ثَغَرْنَاهُمْ We stopped up, or
obstructed, against them the gaps, or passes of the
mountain; (S, TA;) we stopped up, or obstructed,
against them the place of exit, so that they knew
not what way to take. (A.)
