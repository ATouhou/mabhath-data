فَإِنْ تَثْلِثُوا نَرْبَعْ وَإِنْ يَكُ خَامِسٌ
يَكُنْ سَادِسٌ حَتَّى يُبِيرَكُمُ القَتْلُ
[And if ye make up the number of three, we will
make up the number of four; and if there be
a fifth of you, there shall be a sixth of us; so
that slaughter shall destroy you]: (IAar, S, IB:)
he means, if ye become three, we will become

in the present art. in the same copy written
لا يثنِى ولا يثْلِثُ,) or ↓ لَا يُثَنِّى وَلَا يُثَلِّثُ, (so in

ثُلْثٌ: see ثُلُثٌ.
ثِلْثٌ The third young one or offspring, (M, A,
K,) of a she-camel, (M, K,) and, accord, to Th,
of any female: (M:) and in like manner others
are termed, to ten [inclusive]. (A.) But one

q. v.]. (M.) ―
-b2-  سَقَى نَخْلَهُ الثِّلْثَ He watered
his palm-trees once in three days: (A:) or he
watered them بَعْدَ الثُّنْيَا [which app. means after
excepting, or omitting, one day]. (K.) ثِلْثٌ is
not used [thus] except in this case: there is no
ثِلْث in the watering of camels; for the shortest
period of watering is the رِفْه when the camels
drink every day; then is the غِبّ, which is when
they come to the water one day and not the next
day; and next after this is the رِبْع; then, the
خِمْس; and so on to the عِشْر: so says As: (S,
TA:) and this is correct, though J's assertion
that ثِلْث is not used except in this case is said by
F to require consideration. (TA.) ―

i. q. حُمَّى الغِبِّ, [The tertian fever;] the fever
that attacks one day and intermits one day and

ثُلُثٌ (T, S, M, A, Msb, K) and ↓ ثُلْثٌ (Msb,
K) and ↓ ثُلَثٌ, which last is either a dial. var. or
is so pronounced to make the utterance more easy,
(MF,) A third; a third part or portion; (S, A,
Msb, K;) as also ↓ ثَلِيتٌ, (As, T, S, M, Msb, K,)
like ثَمِينٌ and سَبِيعٌ and سَدِيسٌ and خَمِيسٌ and
نَصِيفٌ, (S,) though AZ ignored ثَلِيثٌ (T, S) and
خَمِيسٌ: (S:) [and ↓ مِثْلَاثٌ, q. v., app, signifies
the same:] the pl. of ثلث, (M, Msb,) and of
ثليث also, (M,) is أَثْلَاثٌ. (M, Msb.) It is said
in a trad., دِيَةُ شِبْهِ العَمْدِ أَثْلَاثًا [The expiatory
mulct for that homicide which resembles what is
intentional shall be thirds]; i. e., thirty-three
she-camels each such as is termed حِقَّة, and thirtythree of which each is such as is termed جَذَعَة,
and thirty-four of which each is what is termed
ثَنِيَّة. (TA.)
إِنَآءٌ ثَلْثَانُ A vessel in which the corn &c. that is
measured therein reaches to one third of it: and
in like manner one uses this expression in relation
to beverage, or wine, &c. (M, L.)
ثِلْثَانٌ, (so in a copy of the M,) or ثَلِثَانٌ, and
ثَلَثَانٌ, (K,) I. q. عِنَبُ الثَّعْلَبِ; (K;) the tree
thus called. (M, TA.)
ثَلَاثٌ, also written ثَلٰثٌ: see ثَلَاثَةٌ, in six places:
and ثُلَاثُ, in two places.
ثُلَاثُ and ↓ مَثْلَثُ (S, L, K) Three and three;
three and three together; or three at a time and
three at a time; (L;) imperfectly decl. [because]
changed from the original form of ثَلَاثَةٌ ثَلَاثَةٌ;
(K;) or because of their having the quality of
epithets and deviating from the original form of
ثَلَاثَةٌ: they are epithets; for you say, مَرَرْتُ بِقَوْمٍ
مَثْنَى وَثُلَاثَ [I passed by a party of men two and
two, and three and three, together]: (Sb, S:) or
they are imperfectly decl. because they deviate
from their original as to the letter and the meaning; the original word being changed as above
stated, and the meaning being changed to ثَلَاثَةٌ
ثَلَاثَةٌ: but the dim. is ↓ ثُلَيِّثٌ, perfectly decl., like
أُحَيِّدٌ &c., because it is like حُمَيِّرٌ [dim. of حِمَارٌ],
assuming the form of that which is perfectly decl.,
though it is not so in the cases of أَحْسَنُ and the
like, as these words, in assuming the dim. form,
do not deviate from the measure of a verb, for
مَا أُحَيْسِنَهُ [How goodly is he!] is sometimes said.
(S.) It is said in the Kur [iv. 3], فَانْكِحُوا مَا طَابَ
لَكُمْ مِنَ النِّسَآءِ وَثُلَاثَ وَرُبَاعَ, i. e. Then marry
ye such as please you, of women, two [and] two,
and three [and] three, and four [and] four:
[meaning, two at a time, &c.:] here مثنى &c.
are imperfectly decl. because deviating from the
original form of اِثْنَيْنِ اِثْنَيْنِ, &c., and from the
fem. form. (Zj, T, L.) And one says ↓ مَثْلَثَ مَثْلَثَ,
like ثُلَاثَ ثُلَاثَ. (T.) You say also, فَعَلْتُ الشَّىْءَ
مَثْنَى وَثُلَاثَ وَرُبَاعَ, meaning I did the thing twice
and twice, and thrice and thrice, and four times
and four times. (L.) ―
-b2-  [ثُلَاثٌ is app. fem. of
ثُلَاثَةٌ, a dial, var. of ثَلَاثَةٌ, of which the fem. is
ثَلَاثٌ: and hence,] ذُو ثُلَاثٍ, with damm [to the
initial ث], A camel's [girth of the kind called]
وَضِين. (K.) You say, اِلْتَقَتْ عُرَا ذِى ثُلَاثِهَا
(tropical:)  [lit., The loops of her girth met together]; (A,
TA; [but in a copy of the former, ↓ ذى ثَلَاثِهَا;])
meaning, she was, or became, lean, or lank in the
belly. (A. [See a similar saying voce بِطَانٌ.])
And a poet says,
وَقَدْ ضَمَرَتْ حَتَّى بَدَا ذُو ثُلَاثِهَا
[And she had become lean, or lank in the belly, so
that her girth appeared]: but some say that ذو
ثلاثها [here] means her belly, and the two skins,
[namely,] the upper, and that which is pared, or
scraped off, after the flaying: (TA:) or, accord.
to some, the phrase is حَتَّى ارْتَقَى ذو ثلاثها, meaning, so that her fœtus rose to her back; the ثلاث
[here again in a copy of the A written with fet-h
to the initial ث, and in like manner ثلاثها,] being
the سَابِيَآء and the سَلَا and the womb. (A, TA.)
You say also ↓ عَلَيْهِ ذُو ثَلَاثٍ, [so I find it written,
but perhaps it should be ذو ثُلَاثٍ,] meaning,
(tropical:)  Upon him is a [garment of the kind called]
كِسَآء made of the wool of three sheep. (A, TA.
[In the latter without any syll. sign to show that
ثلاث here differs from the form in the exs. cited
before.])
ثِلَاث: see ثَالِثٌ.
ثَلُوثٌ A she-camel that fills three vessels (S,
M, A, L, K) such as are called أَقْدَاح, (M, L,)
when she is milked, (S, K,) [i. e.,] at one milking.
(A.) This is the utmost quantity that the camel
yields at one milking. (IAar, M.) ―
-b2-  Also A
she-camel three of whose teats dry up: (S, M, A,
K: [accord. to the TA, it is said in the T that
such is termed ↓ مَثْلُوثٌ; but I think that this is a
mistranscription:]) or that has had one of her
teats cut off (IAar, T, M, L, K) by cauterization,
which becomes a mark to her, (IAar, M,) and
[in some copies of the K “ or ”] is milked from
three teats: (T, M, L, K:) or that has three
teats; (IAar, TA;) [and] so ↓ مُثَلِّثَةٌ: (T, TA:)
or a she-camel having one of her teats dried up
in consequence of something that has happened to
it. (ISk.)
ثَلِيثٌ: see ثُلُثٌ.
ثَلَاثَةٌ, also written ثَلٰثَةٌ, a noun of number,
[i. e. Three,] is masc., (S, M, Msb,) and is also
written and pronounced ↓ ثُلَاثَةٌ, with damm:
(IAar, M, TA:) the fem. is ↓ ثَلَاثٌ, also written
ثَلٰثٌ; (S, M, Msb;) [and app. ثُلَاثٌ also, mentioned above, under the head of ثُلَاثُ, but only as
occurring with ذُو prefixed to it.] You say ثُلَاثَةُ
رِجَالٍ [Three men]: and نِسْوَةٍ ↓ ثَلَاثُ [three
women]. (Msb.) In the saying of Mohammad,
↓ رُفِعَ القَلَمُ عَنْ ثَلَاثٍ [The pen of the recording
angel is withheld from three persons] ثلاث is for
ثَلَاثِ أَنْفُسٍ. (Msb. [See art. رفع.]) [In like
manner, ↓ ثَلَاثٌ occurs in several trads. for ثَلَاثُ
خِصَالٍ; as, for instance, in the saying,] ثَلَاثٌ مَنْ
كُنَّ فِيهِ حَاسَبَهُ اللّٰهُ حِسَابًا يَسِيرًا [There are three
qualities: in whomsoever they be, God will reckon
with him with an easy reckoning]: these are, thy
giving to him who denies thee, and forgiving him
who wrongs thee, and being kind to him who
cuts thee off from him. (El-Jámi' es-Sagheer.)
The people of El-Hijáz say, أَتَوْنِى ثَلَاثَتَهُمْ [The
three of them came to me], and أَرْبَعَتَهُمْ, and so on
to ten [inclusive], with nasb in every case; and
in like manner in the fem., ↓ أَتَيْنَنِى ثَلَاثَهُنَّ, and
أَرْبَعَهُنَّ: but others decline the word with the three
vowels, making it like كُلُّهُمْ: after ten, however,
only nasb is used; so that you say, أَتَوْنِى أَحَدَ عَشَرَهُمْ
[and ثَلَاثَةَ عَشَرَهُمْ], and إِحْدَى عَشْرَتَهُنَّ [and ثَلَاثَ
عَشْرَتَهُنَّ]. (S.) The saying وَلَدُ الزِّنَا شَرٌ الثَّلَاثَةِ
means [The offspring of adultery, or fornication,
is the worst of the three] if he do the deeds of his
parents. (Mgh.) [It is said that when ثلاثة
means the things numbered, not the amount of
the number, it is imperfectly decl., being regarded
as a proper name; and so are other ns. of number. (See ثُمَانِيةٌ.) See also سِتَّةٌ.] ―
-b2-  ثَلَاثَةَ عَشَرَ
[indecl. in every case, meaning Thirteen,] is pronounced by some of the Arabs ثَلَاثَةَ عْشَرَ: and
[the fem.] عَشْرَةَ ↓ ثَلَاثَ, thus in the dial. of El-
Hijáz [and of most of the Arabs], is pronounced
ثَلَاثَ عَشِرَةَ in the dial. of Nejd. (S in art. عشر.)
ثُلَاثَةٌ: see ثَلَاثَةٌ.
الثَّلَاثَآءُ, also written الثَّلٰثَآءُ, (Lth, T, S, M,) or
يَوْمُ الثَّلَاثَآءِ or الثَّلٰثَآءِ, (A, Msb, K,) and ↓ الثُّلَاثَآء,
with damm, (A, K,) [meaning The third day of
the week, Tuesday,] has this form for the sake of
distinction; for properly it should be الثَّالِثُ: (S,
M:) or it has meddeh in the place of the ة in the
noun of number [ثَلَاثَةٌ] to distinguish it from the
latter: (Lth, T:) [it is without tenween in every
case; when indeterminate as well as when determinate; being fem.:] the pl. is ثَلَاثَاوَاتٌ (S, M,
Msb) and أَثَالِثُ. (Th, M.) It has no dim. (Sb,
S in art. امس.) Lh relates that Aboo-Ziyád used
to say, مَضَى الثَّلَاثَآءُ بِمَا فِيهِ [Tuesday passed with
what occurred in it]; making ثلاثاء sing. and masc.;
[but this he did because he meant thereby يَوْمُ
الثَّلَاثَآءِ; يوم being masc.:] Th is related to have
said, بِمَا فِيهَا; making it fem.: and Abu-l-Jarráh
used to say, مَضَتِ الثَّلَاثَآءُ بِمَا فِيهِنَّ, treating the
word as a numeral. (M.)
الثُّلَاثَآءُ: see الثَّلَاثَآءُ.
ثُلَاثِىٌّ a rel. n. from ثَلَاثَةٌ, anomalously formed,
(M,) [or regularly formed from ثُلَاثَةٌ,] Of, or
relating to, three things. (T, TA.) ―
-b2-  Three cubits
in length, or height; applied in this sense to a
garment, or piece of cloth; (T, A;) and to a
boy. (T.) ―
-b3-  A word comprising, or composed
of, three letters [radical only, or of three radical
letters with one or more augmentative; i. e., of
three radical letters with, or without, an augment].
(T, TA.)
ثَلَاثُونَ, [also written ثَلٰثُونَ,] the noun of number, [meaning Thirty, and also thirtieth,] is not
considered as a multiple of ثَلَاثَةٌ, but as a multiple
of عَشَرَةٌ; and therefore, if you name a man ثَلَاثُونَ,
you do not make the dim. to be ثَلِيِّثُون, but [you
assimilate the noun from which it is formed to a
pl. with و and ن from عَشَرَةٌ, or to عِشْرُونَ, and
say] ↓ ثُلَيْثُونَ. (Sb, M.)
ثُلَيْثُونَ: see what immediately precedes.
ثَلَاثَاوِىٌّ: One who fasts alone on the third day
of the week. (IAar, Th, M.)
ثُلَيِّثٌ: see ثُلَاثُ.
ثَالِثٌ [Third]: fem. with ة. (T, &c.) The final
ث in الثَّالِثُ is sometimes changed into ى. (M.)
You say, هُوَ ثَالِثُ ثَلَاثَةٍ [He, or it, is the third of
three]: thus you say when the two [terms] agree,
each with the other; but not ثَالِثٌ ثَلَاثَةً; ثالث
being regarded in the former case as though it
were a subst.; for you do not mean to convey by
it a verbal signification, but only mean that he, or
it, is one of the three, or a portion of the three:
(Fr, ISk, T, S:) and in like manner you say,
هِىَ ثَالِثَةُ ثَلَاثَ [She is the third of three]; but
when there is among the females a male, you say,
هِىَ ثَالِثَةُ ثَلَاثَةٍ, making the masc. to predominate
over the fem. (T.) When the two [terms] are
different, you may make the former to govern the
gen. case or to govern as a verb; saying, هُوَ رَابِعُ
ثَلَاثَةٍ or هُوَ رَابِعٌ ثَلَاثَةً, like as you say ضَارِبُ زَيْدٍ
and ضَارِبٌ زَيْدًا; and thus you also say, هٰذَا ثَالِثُ
اثْنَيْنِ and هٰذَا ثَالِثٌ اثْنَيْنِ, meaning This makes
two to be three, with himself, or itself. (ISk, T, *
S. [In most copies of the S, for ثَالِثٌ اثْنَيْنِ is
put ثَالِثَ اثْنَيْنِ; and, in the explanation of this
phrase, ثَلَّثَ اثْنَيْنِ for ثَلَثَ اثْنَيْنِ: IB has remarked that these are mistakes.]) ↓ ثِلَاث occurs in
the sense of ثَالِث in a trad. cited voce ثَانٍ in art.
ثنى. (Sh, T in art. ثنى.) ―
-b2-  ثَالِثَةُ الأَثَافِى means
A projecting portion of a mountain, by which
are placed two pieces of rock, upon all which is
placed the cooking-pot. (S, K.) Hence the saying,
رَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ بِثَالِثَةِ الأَثَافِى [explained in art. اثف].
(TA.) ―
-b3-  [ثَالِثَ عَشَرَ and ثَالِثَةَ عَشْرَةَ, the former masc.
and the latter fem., meaning Thirteenth, are generally held to be indecl. in every case without the art.;
but with the art., most say in the nom. الثَّالِثُ عَشَرَ,
accus. الثَّالِثَ عَشَرَ, and gen. الثَّالِثِ عَشَرَ; and in
like manner in the fem. Accord. to some,] you
say, هُوَ ثَالِثُ عَشَرَ as well as هُوَ ثَالِثَ عَشَرَ [He,
or it, is a thirteenth]: he who uses the former
phrase says that he means هُوَ ثَالِثُ ثَلَاثَةَ عَشَرَ,
(T, S,) i. e. He, or it, is one of thirteen, (T,) and
that he suppresses ثلاثه, and leaves ثالث decl. as
it was; and he who uses the latter phrase says
that he likewise means this, but that, suppressing
ثلاثة, he gives its final vowel to the word ثالث,
(T, S,) to show that there is a suppression: (S:)
but IB says that the former of these two phrases
is wrong; that the Koofees allow it, but that
the Basrees disallow it, and pronounce it a mistake. (L.) [And accord. to J, one says, هٰذَا
الثَّالِثَ عَشَرَ and هٰذِهِ الثَّالِثَةَ عَشْرَةَ This is the thirteenth, or this thirteenth: for he adds,] and you
say, هذَا الحَادِى عَشَرَ and الثَّانِىَ عَشَرَ and so on
to twenty [exclusive]; all with fet-h; for the
reason which we have mentioned: and in like
manner in the fem., in which each of the two
nouns is with ة. (S.) You say also, ثَالِثَ عَشَرَ
ثَلَاثَةَ عَشَرَ [The thirteenth of thirteen]; and so
on to تَاسِعَ عَشَرَ تِسْعَةَ عَشَرَ: and in like manner in
the fem. (I' AK p. 316.)
