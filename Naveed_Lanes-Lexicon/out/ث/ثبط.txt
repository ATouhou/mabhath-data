ثَبِطَ, aor.
ثَبَطَ, [inf. n., accord. to rule, ثَبْطٌ,]
(K,) or, as Sgh says, [judging from the part. n.
ثَبِطٌ,] thus analogy requires that it should be,
(TA,) He was, or became, stupid in his work, or
action; and weak: and he (a man, and a horse,
K and TA, said of a horse with respect to covering,
TA) was, or became, heavy, sluggish, or slow.
(K, * TA.)

him, withheld him, or prevented him, (IDrd, Msb,
