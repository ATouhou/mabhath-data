(T, K.) ثَدِيَتِ الأَرْضُ i. q. سَدِيَت [The land

known. (M.)

ثَدَّىَ see 1.
ثَدْىٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.) and ثِدْىٌ
and ثَدًى: (K:) the first of these is the form
most commonly obtaining: (TA:) [The breast,
or mamma;] the part of the chest whereof the
حَلَمَة is the head; each of the two parts whereof
the حَلَمَتَانِ are the two heads: (Zj in his “ Khalk
el-Insán: ”) [and sometimes, but not properly,
the حَلَمَة alone; i. e., the pap, nipple, or mamilla:] you say ثَدْى مُقْعَدٌ a breast that is swelling, prominent, or protuberant, (S, A, L, K, in
art. قعد,) that fills the hand, (A in that art.,) and
has not yet become folding: (S, L, K, in that
art.:) and رَضَعَ ثَدْىَ أُمِّهِ [he sucked the breast,
meaning the pap, or nipple, of his mother].
(IKtt in TA, art. رضع:) it is peculiar to woman;
(T, K;) or common to woman and man; (S,
Msb, K;) being sometimes used in relation to a
man; (Msb;) accord. to the opinion held to be
most chaste and best known by the lexicologists
[in general]: (TA:) and is masc.; (T, M, Mgh;)
or masc. and fem.; (S, Msb, K;) but most
chastely masc.: (TA;) the pl. [of pauc.] is أَثْدٍ,
(S, M, Msb, K,] [originally أَثْدُىٌ,] of the measure
أَفْعُلٌ, (Msb,) and [of mult.] ثُدِىٌّ, (S, M, Msb, K,)
[originally ثُدُوىٌ,] of the measure فُعُولٌ, (S, Msb,)
and ثِدِىٌّ, with kesr to the ث because of the
kesr to the letter following, (S,) and sometimes
ثِدَآءٌ, [originally ثِدَاىٌ,] like سِهَامٌ; (Msb;) and
a poet says,
وَأَصْبَحَتِ النِّسَآءُ مُسَلِّبَاتٍ
لَهُنَّ الوَيْلُ يَمْدُدْنَ الثُّدِينَا
[And the women became widowed, or bereft of
relations, and without their ornaments, or in
mourning, having woe, pulling the breasts]; but
this is something like a mistake; and it may be
that he meant التُّدِيَّا, and changed the [latter]
ى into ن for the sake of the rhyme. (M.) It
is said in a prov., تُجَوَّعُ الحُرَّةُ وَلَا تَأْكُلُ ثَدْيَيْهَا,
meaning, أُجْرَةَ ثَدْيَيْهَا, [i. e. The ingenuous woman
will be made to hunger and will not eat the hire
of her breasts,] the prefixed noun being suppressed; or, as some relate it, بِثَدْيَيْهَا, which is
plain [as meaning, by means of her breasts]: it
is applied in relation to a man's preserving himself
from ignoble means of acquiring wealth. (Mgh.)
And جُدَّ ثَدْىُ أُمِّهِ, May his mother's breast be
cut off, is a form of imprecation against a man,
and used to imply a wish for his separation. (As,
L in art. جد.) The saying of 'Alee, on the day
of his slaughter of the Khawárij, اُنْظُرُوا فَإِنَّ فِيِهمْ
رَجُلًا إِحْدَى يَدَيْهِ مِثْلُ ثَدْىِ المَرْأَةِ [Look ye, for
among them is a man one of whose arms is like
the breast of the woman], not احدى ثَدْيَيْهِ as
some relate it, was applied to a man who had,
in the place of one arm, a lump of flesh upon
his shoulder-joint, which lump, when it was
stretched, became equal in length to his other
arm, and when it was left, returned [to its original form]. (Mgh.) Respecting ↓ ثُدَيَّةٌ, the
dim., whence the surname ذَو الثُّدَيَّةِ, he who
holds ثَدْىٌ to be masc. [only] says that the ة is
added because the word [virtually] means اليَد,
[which is fem.,] for the man thus surnamed had
a short arm, of the size of the ثَدْى, as is indicated by the fact that they also called him ذُو
اليُدَيَّةِ: (S:) or, accord. to Fr, (A'Obeyd, T,)
ة is added, in this instance, in the dim., though
ثَدْىٌ is masc., because it applies to what resembled the remains (بَقِيَّة) of a ثَدْى, the greater
part of it having gone, so that it is like لُحَمْيَةٌ and
شُحَيْمَةٌ [dims. of لَحْمَةٌ and شَحْمَةٌ]: (T, M:) or
the ة is added because the word is regarded in
this case as meaning البَضْعَةُ [the piece, or lump,
of flesh]: (Mgh:) some say that it is the dim.
of ثَنْدُوَةٌ; (Mgh, TA;) but this requires consideration. (Mgh.)
ثُدَيَّةٌ: see ثَدْىٌ. ―
-b2-  Also A repository, or receptacle, (AA, K,) of the size of the fist, (AA,)
in which the horseman carries the [sinews called]
عَقَب [of which the bow-string is made, and which
are bound round a bow, and round an arrow, to
repair a fracture in it, (see عَقَبٌ and عَقَبَ,)]
and the feathers [which he may require to attach
to any of his arrows]. (AA, K.)
ثُدَّآءٌ A certain plant [growing] in the desert. (S.)
ثَدْيَآءُ A woman large in the ثَدْيَانِ [or breasts]:
أَثْدَى, the masc. form, is not used. (S, M.)
ثَنْدُوَةٌ, [written by some ثُنْدُوَةٌ, as well as ثَنْدُؤَةٌ
and ثَنْدُؤَةٌ,] mentioned here in the S, and in art.
ثدأ: see the latter art.
