ثعلبQ. 1
ثَعْلَبَ He (a man) was cowardly, and
eluded, or turned away, or went this way and
that, or to the right and left, quickly, and deceitfully, or guilefully; as also ↓ تَثَعْلَبَ: his doing
so being thus likened to the running of the ثَعْلَب.
(TA.) And ثعلب مِنْهُ فَرَقًا [He was cowardly,
and eluded him, or turned away from him, &c.,
through fear]; i. e., from another man. (TA.)
Q. 2
تَثَعْلَبَ: see above.
ثَعْلَبٌ [The fox; canis vulpes of Linn.: but
in the dial. of Egypt, the jackal; canis aureus
of Linn.: the former animal being there called
أَبُو الحُصَيْنِ, as it often is by the Arabs of other
countries:] a certain beast of prey; (TA;) well
known: (S, K:) applied to the male and the
female; so that one says ثَعْلَبٌ ذَكَرٌ and ثَعْلَبٌ
أُنْثَى; but if one would designate the male by a
single word applying to it only, he says ↓ ثُعْلُبَانٌ,
with damm to the ث and ل: (IAmb, Msb:)
or the former applies to the female: (K:) or the
female is called ↓ ثَعْلَبَةٌ; (Ks, S, Msb, K;) and
the male, ↓ ثُعْلُبَانٌ (Ks, S, K) and ثَعْلَبٌ, (K,)
[accord. to some,] like as one says عَقْرَبَةٌ [and
عُقْرُبَانٌ] and عَقْرَبٌ: (Msb:) or ثَعْلَبٌ is the male;
and the female is called ↓ ثُعَالَةُ: (Az, TA: [but see
this word is art. ثعل:]) the pl. of ثعلب is ثَعَالِبُ
and ثَعَالٍ, (K,) accord. to Lh: but ISd disapproves of this [latter pl.]; and Sb does not
allow it except in poetry. (TA.) F charges J
with error in citing, as a proof that ↓ ثُعْلُبَانٌ signifies the male, the following verse:
أَرَبٌّ يَبُولُ الثُّعْلُبَانُ بِرَأْسِهِ
لَقَدْ ذَلَّ مَنْ بَالَتْ عَلَيْهِ الثَّعَالِبُ
[Is he a Lord, upon whose head the he-fox makes
water? (the ب in برأسه being syn. with عَلَى:
so in the Mughnee, in art. ب:) Vile indeed is he
upon whom the foxes make water!] said by a man
who was keeper of an idol, on seeing a he-fox
make water upon it: but in this, F opposes also
Ks and others; and it is asserted by several authorities that the correct reading of the word ثعلبان
in a trad. whereby F attempts to establish his
charge against J is not ثَعْلَبَانِ, dual. of ثَعْلَبٌ,
as he pronounces it to be, but ثُعْلَبَانِ, which is
said to be the masc. of ثَعْلَبٌ, like as أُفْعُوَانٌ and
عُقْرُبَانٌ are mascs. of أَفْعًى and عَقْرَبٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-
دَآءُ الثَّعْلَبِ [for which Golius seems to have found
in a copy of the K دَوَآءُ الثَّعْلَبِ] A well-known
disease, [namely, alopecia,] (S, K,) in consequence
of which the hair falls off. (S.) ―
-b3-  عِنَبُ الثَّعْلَبِ
[Fox-grape: rendered by Golius “ uvæ vulpinæ,
i. e. solanum: ” but now applied by some to the
gooseberry: and the solanum nigrum, or gardennightshade, is now commonly called عِنَبُ الذِّئْبِ:]
a certain astringent, cooling plant: seven (or,
as in one copy of the K, nine) حَبَّات [which here
seems to mean berries] thereof, swallowed, are
a cure for the jaundice (اليَرَقَان), and stop pregnancy, (K, TA,) like the berries of the خِرْوَع [or
castor-oil-plant], for the year, or, as some say,
absolutely. (TA.)
-A2-  A hole, or aperture, (جُحْر,)
whence rain-water flows. (TA.) [And particularly,] The outlet, hole, or aperture, (مَخْرَج, S
and Msb, or جُحْر, K, or ثَقْب, TA,) whence the
rain-water flows from the place where dates are
dried. (S, Msb, K, TA.) And The place whence
the water flows forth (L, K) from, (L, TA,) or
to, (K, [probably a mistake,]) a watering-trough
or tank. (L, K.)
-A3-  The upper extremity of a
spear-shaft that enters into the head thereof. (S,
K.) ―
-b2-  The lowest part of a palm-shoot when it is

-A2-  Also The os coccygis, or

ثُعْلُبَانٌ: see ثَعْلَبٌ, in three places.
ثَعْلَبِيَّةٌ A running of the horse like the running
of the dog. (K.)
ثْعَالَةُ: see ثَعْلَبٌ, and see art. ثعل.
أَرْضٌ مُثَعْلِبَةٌ A land having ثَعَالِب [or foxes]:
(S:) or, having many thereof; as also أَرضٌ مَثْعَلَةٌ;
(K;) which is from ثُعَالَةٌ; or it may be from
ثَعْلَبٌ, like مَعْقَرَةٌ applied to “ a land having many
عَقَارِب [or scorpions]. ” (S, L.)
