ثنى1
ثَنَاهُ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) said in the
K to be like سَعَى, implying that the aor. is
ثَنَىَ,
but this is a mistake, (MF, TA,) [for it is well
known that] the aor. is
ثَنِىَ, (Msb,) inf. n. ثَنْىٌ, (S,
M, Msb, &c.,) He doubled it, or folded it; (T;)
he turned one part of it upon another; (M, K;)
he bent it; (T, S, Mgh, Msb, TA;) he drew, or
contracted, one of its two extremities to [or towards] the other; or joined, or adjoined, one of
them to the other; thus bending it; (Mgh;)
namely, a stick, or branch, or twig, (Mgh,) or a
thing, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) of any kind. (T.)
One says of a man with the mention of whom one
begins, in relation to an honourable or a praiseworthy quality, or in relation to science or knowledge, بِهِ تُثْنَى الخَنَاصِرُ, (T,) meaning With [the
mention of] him, (T, and Msb in art. خصر,)
among others of his class, (Msb ib.,) the little
fingers are bent. (T, and Msb ubi suprá. [For
the Arabs, in counting with the fingers, first bend
the tip of the little finger down to the palm of the
hand; then, the tip of the next; and so on;
bending the thumb down upon the other fingers
for five; and then continue by extending the fingers, one after another, again commencing with
the little finger.]) And a poet says,
فَإِنْ عُدَّ مَجْدٌ أَوْ قَدِيمٌ لِمَعْشَرٍ
فَقَوْمِى بِهِمْ تُثْنَى هُنَاكَ لأَصَابِعُ
[And if glory, or any old ground of pretension to
honour, be reckoned as belonging to a body of
men, it is my people, with the mention of them,
in that case, the fingers are bent]; meaning that
they are reckoned as the best; (IAar, M;) for
the best are not many. (M.) One says also,
ثَنَى وَرِكَهُ فَنَزَلَ [lit. He bent his hip, and alighted],
meaning he alighted from his beast. (T.) And
ثَنَى رِجْلَهُ عَنْ دَابَّتِهِ, meaning He drew up his leg
to his thigh, and alighted. (M.) But قَبْلَ أَنْ
يَثْنِىَ رِجْلَهُ, occurring in a trad., means Before he
turned his leg from the position in which it was
in the pronouncing of the testimony of the faith.
(IAth.) ثَنَى صَدْرَهُ, aor. and inf. n. as above,
[lit. He folded his breast, or bosom,] means (assumed tropical:)  he
concealed enmity in his breast, or bosom: or he
folded up what was in it, in concealment. (TA.)
It is said in the Kur [xi. 5], أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ يَثْنَونَ صُدُورَهُمْ,
meaning [Now surely] they infold and conceal [in
their bosoms] enmity and hatred: (Fr, T:) or
they bend their breasts, or bosoms, and fold up,
and conceal, what is therein: (Zj, T:) I'Ab
read, صُدُورُهُمْ ↓ تَثْنَوْنِى: you say, اِثْنَوْنَى صَدْرُهُ
عَلَى البَغْضَآءِ, meaning his breast, or bosom, infolded, or concealed, vehement hatred: (T:) or
the phrase in the Kur, accord. to the former
reading, means they bend, or turn, their breasts,
or bosoms, from the truth; they turn themselves
away therefrom: or they incline their breasts, or
bosoms, to unbelief, and enmity to the Prophet:
or they turn their backs: (Bd:) [for] ―
-b2-  ثَنَاهُ, (T,
S, Msb, TA,) aor. as above, (Msb,) and so the
inf. n., (T, Msb, TA,) also signifies He turned
him, or it, away or back. (T, S, Msb, TA.) Also
He turned him, or turned him away or back,
(Lth, T, S,) from the course that he desired to
pursue, (Lth, T,) or from the object of his want:
(S:) or you say, ثَنَاهُ عَنْ وَجْهِهِ, (Mgh,) and عَنْ
حَاجَتِهِ, (TA,) and عَنْ مُرَادِهِ, (Msb,) he turned
him, or turned him away or back, (Mgh, Msb,
TA,) from his course, (Mgh,) and from the object
of his want, (TA,) and from the object of his
desire. (Msb.) One says also, فُلَانٌ لَا يُثْنَى عَنْ قِرْنِهِ
وَلَا عَنْ وَجْهِهِ [Such a one will not be turned, or
turned away or back, from his antagonist, nor
from his course]. (T.) ―
-b3-  Also He tied it; or
tied it in a knot or knots; or tied it firmly, fast,
or strongly. (TA.) You say, ثَنَيْتُ البَعِيرَ بِثِنَايَيْنِ,
meaning, accord. to As, as related by A'Obeyd,
I bound both the fore legs of the camel with two
bonds: but correctly, I bound the two fore legs of
the camel with the two ends of a rope; the last
word meaning a single rope: (T:) عَقَلْتُهُ بِثَنْيَيْنِ
means I bound one of his fore shanks to the arm
with two ties, or tyings. (T, M.) ―
-b4-  ثَنْىٌ [as
inf. n. of ثَنَى] also signifies The act of drawing,
or joining, or adjoining, one [thing] to another;
(Lth, T, Mgh;) and so ↓ تَثْنِيَةٌ [inf. n. of ثنّى].
(Mgh.) ―
-b5-  [As ثَلَثَهُمْ signifies “ he took the third
of their property,” and “ he made them, with
himself, three,” and other verbs of number are
used in similar senses, so] ثَنَاهُ signifies He took
the half of their property: or he drew, or adjoined, to him what became with him two: (TA:)
or ثَنَيْتُهُ, (S, Msb,) aor. and inf. n. as above,
(Msb,) signifies I became (S, Msb) to him, (S,)
or with him, (Msb,) a second; (S, Msb;) or I
was a second to him, or it: (Er-Rághib:) or one
should not say thus, but that AZ says, (M,) هُوَ
وَاحِدٌ فَاثْنِهِ (M, K [but in the latter, هٰذَا in the
place of هُوَ, and in the CK, ↓ فأَثْنِه,]) he is one,
and be thou a second to him. (M, K.) ―
-b6-  ثَنَى,
aor. as above, also signifies He made eleven to be
twelve. (T in art. ثلث.) ―
-b7-  ثَنَى الأَرْضَ, inf. n.
as above, He turned over the land, or ground,
twice for sowing, or cultivating: (Mgh, and A *
and TA * in art. ثلث:) and ↓ تَثْنِيَةٌ [inf. n. of
ثنّى] and ثُنُيَانٌ [app. another inf. n. of ثَنَى, and
app. correctly written ثُنْيَانٌ] are often used by
[the Imám] Mohammad in the sense of ثَنْىٌ: he
who explains تَثْنِيَةٌ as signifying the turning over
[the land, or ground,] for sowing, or cultivating,
after the harvest, or as signifying the restoring
land to its owner turned over for sowing, or cultivating, commits an inadvertence. (Mgh.) ―
-b8-
فَاثْنِنِى, occurring in a poem of Kutheiyir 'Azzeh,
is explained as meaning Then give thou to me a
second time: (M, TA:) but this is strange: (TA:)
[ISd says,] I have not seen it in any other instance. (M.) ―
-b9-  لَا يَثْنِى وَلَا يَثْلِثُ, (a phrase
mentioned by IAar, M,) or وَلَا يُثَلِّثُ ↓ لَا يُثَنِّى,
or وَلَا يُثْلِثُ ↓ لَا يُثْنِى: see 1 in art. ثلث.
2
ثنّاهُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَثْنِيَةٌ, (S, K,)
He made it two; or called it two. (S, M, MS b,
K.) [Hence,] ثَنَّى means also He counted two;
whence the saying, فُلَانٌ يُثَنِّى وَلَا يُثَلِّثُ; see art.
ثلث: (A and TA in art. ثلث:) [and so, app.,
↓ اِثَّنَى; for] a poet says,
بَدَا بِأَبِى ثُمَّ اثَّنَى بِأَبِى أَبِى
[which seems plainly to mean He began with my
father; then counted two with the father of my
father]. (M.) ―
-b2-  [He dualized it, namely, a
word; made it to have a dual. ―
-b3-  He marked it
with two points, namely, a ت or a ى.] ―
-b4-  He
repeated it; iterated it. (Mgh.) See 1, in three
places. ―
-b5-  ثنّى لِامْرَأَتِهِ, or عِنْدَهَا, He remained
two nights with his wife: and in like manner the
verb is used in relation to any saying or action.
(TA voce سَبَّعَ.) ―
-b6-  ثنّى بِالأَمْرِ He did the thing
immediately after another thing. (T.) ―
-b7-  تَثْنِيَةٌ
also signifies A man's requesting others [who are
playing with him at the game called المَيْسِر] to
return, for [a chance of] the stakes, his arrow,
when it has been successful, and he has been secure,
and has won. (Lh, M.)
-A2-  See also 4.

أَثْنَتْ, or ↓ اِثْتَنَتْ, She brought forth her
second offspring. (TA in art. بكر.) ―
-b2-  See also 1,
in two places. ―
-b3-  اثنى, (inf. n. إِثْنَآءٌ, TA,) He
shed his tooth called the ثَنِيَّة; (S, Mgh, Msb;)
he became what is termed ثُنِىّ; said of a camel
[&c.]: (M, K:) he shed his رَوَاضِع [pl. of رَاضِعَة
which is the same, in this case, as ثَنِيَّة]; said of
a horse [&c.]. (IAar, T.)
-A2-  اثنى عَلَيْهِ, (T, S, M,
Msb, K, &c.,) inf. n. إِثْنَآءٌ; (T;) and ↓ ثنّى, inf. n.
تَثْنِيَةٌ, accord. to the K, but this is a mistake for
↓ ثبّى, inf. n. تَثْبِيَةٌ; (TA;) He praised, eulogized, commended, or spoke well of, him: and he
dispraised, censured, discommended, or spoke ill
of, him: (T, * M, Msb, K:) the object is either
God or a man: (T:) or it has the former meaning only: (M, K;) or the former meaning is
the more common: (Msb:) accord. to IAar,
اثنى signifies he spoke, or said, well, or good;
and ill, or evil; and انثى, “he defamed,” or
“did so in the absence of the object;” and “he
disdained, scorned, shunned, disliked, or hated,” a
thing: (T:) and you say, اثنى عَلَيْهِ خَيْرًا [He
spoke, or said, well, or good, of him]; (S, and
TA from a trad.;) and شَرًّا [ill, or evil], also.
(TA from the same trad.) One says also, أَثْنَيْتُ
فِعْلَهُ [I praised his deed]; meaning عَلَى فِعْلِهِ;
or because أَثْنَى means مَدَحَ. (Ham p. 696.)
5
تثنّى: see 7. ―
-b2-  Also He affected an inclining of his body, or a bending, or he inclined
his body, or bent, from side to side; syn. تَمَايَلَ:
(Har pp. 269 and 271:) and he walked with an
elegant and a proud and self-conceited gait, with
an affected inclining of the body from side to
side; or with a twisting of the back, and with
extended steps; syn. تَبَخْتَرَ. (Idem p. 271.) You
say, تثنّى فِى مِشْيَتِهِ (S, and Har p. 269) He
affected an inclining of his body, or a bending, or
he inclined his body, or bent, from side to side, in
his gait. (Har ib.) [And in like manner, and
more commonly, one says of a woman.]

انثنى, (T, S, M, K,) and ↓ تثنّى, and ↓ اِثَّنَى,
of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ, (M, K,) originally اِثْتَنَى,
(M,) and ↓ اِثْنَوْنَى, (T, S, K,) of the measure
اِفْعَوْعَلَ, (T, S,) It was, or became, doubled, or
folded; (T;) it had one part turned upon another; (M, K;) it was, or became, bent. (T, S.)
―
-b2-  [Hence,] انثنى signifies also He turned, or
turned away or back, (Har pp. 44 and 120,)
عَنْ أَمْرٍ from an affair, after having determined
to do it. (Lth in TA art. زمع.)

إِثْتَنَىَ see 7, and 4: ―
-b2-  and see also 2.
10
استثناهُ He set it aside as excluded; or he
excluded it, or excepted it; مِنْ شَىْءٍ from a thing;
syn. حَاشَاهُ: (M:) or he set it aside, or apart, for
himself: and in the conventional language of the
grammarians, [he excepted it; i. e.] he excluded
it from the predicament in which another thing
was included, or in which other things were included: (Mgh:) الاِسْتِثْنَآءُ [in grammar] is the
turning away the agent from reaching the object
of the اِسْتِثْنَآء: (Msb:) in the case of an oath
[and the like], it means the saying إِنْ شَآءَ اللّٰهُ [If
God will]. (Mgh.) [See ثُنْيَا.]
12
اثنونى: see 7; and see also 1.
ثِنْىٌ A duplication, or doubling, of a thing:
(T, * S, Msb:) pl. أَثْنَآءٌ; (S, Msb;) or the sing.
may be ↓ ثَنًى. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  A folding: so in the
saying, أَنْفَذْتُ كَذَا ثِنْىَ كِتَابِى, (S, TA,) or
فِى ثِنْىِ كِتَابِىِ (so in a copy of the S,) i. e.,
فِى طَيِّهِ [lit. I sent, or transmitted, such a thing
within the folding of my writing, or letter;
meaning infolded, or enclosed, in it; and included
in it]. (S, TA.) ―
-b3-  A duplicature, or fold, of a
garment, or piece of cloth: (TA:) or what is
turned back of the extremities thereof: (T:) pl.
as above: whence, in a trad. of Aboo-Hureyreh,
كَانَ يَثْنِيهِ عَلَيْهِ أَثْنَآءً مِنْ سَعَتِهِ [He used to fold it
upon him in folds by reason of its width]; meaning the garment. (TA.) [Hence the saying,]
وَكَانَ ذٰلِكَ فِى أَثْنَآءِ كَذَا, i. e., فى غُضُونِهِ [lit And
that was in the folds, meaning, in the midst, of
such a thing, or such an affair, or event]. (TA.)
And جَاؤُوا فِى أَثْنَآءِ الأَمْرِ They came in the midst
of the affair, or event. (Msb.) [And hence,
app.,] مَضَى ثِنْىٌ مِنَ اللَّيْل An hour, or a period,
or a short portion, of the night passed; (M, K; *)
syn. سَاعَةٌ, (Th, M, K,) or وَقْتٌ. (Lh, M, K.)
[See also what is said below respecting its pl. in
relation to a night.] ―
-b4-  Also sing. of أَثْنَآءٌ meaning
The parts of a thing that are laid together like
the strands of a rope, or that are laid one upon
another as layers or strata, or side by side as the
things that compose a bundle; (قُوَاهُ, and طَاقَاتُهُ;
[rendered by Freytag “ virtutes, facultates rei; ”])
and ↓ مَثَانٍ, of which the sing. is ↓ مَثْنَاةٌ and ↓ مِثْنَاةٌ,
signifies the same. (M, K.) ―
-b5-  Also A bending
of the neck of a sheep, or goat, not in consequence
of disease: (K: but in the M, ثَنْىٌ [inf. n. of 1]:)
and a serpent's bending, or folding, of itself: (M,
K:) and also (thus in the M, but in the K “or”)
a curved part of a serpent that has folded itself;
(M, K;) pl. أَثْنَآءٌ, (M,) i. e. the folds of a coiled
serpent. (T.) The pl. is used metaphorically [as
though meaning (tropical:)  The turns] of a night. (M.
[But see explanations of the sing. as used in relation to a night in what precedes.] ―
-b6-  A part that
is bent, or folded, or doubled, of a وِشَاح [q. v.];
(TA;) pl. as above: (T, TA:) and so of a rope:
(S:) or a portion of the extremity of a rope
folded, or doubled, [so as to form a loop,] for
binding therewith the pastern of the fore leg of a
beast, to serve as a tether. (T.) Tarafeh says,
لَعَمْرُكَ إِنَّ المَوْتَ مَا أَخْطَأَ الفَتَى
لَكَالطِّوَلِ المُرْخَى وَثِنْيَاهُ بِالْيَدِ
[By thy life, death, while missing the strong
young man, is like the tether that is slackened
while the two folded extremities thereof are upon
the fore leg, or in the hand: see طِوَلٌ]: (T, S:)
he means that the young man must inevitably die,
though his term of life be protracted; like as the
beast, though his tether be lengthened and slackened, cannot escape, being withheld by its two
extremities: (so in a copy of the T:) or by ثنياه
he means its extremity; using the dual form
because it is folded, or doubled, upon the pastern,
and tied with a double tie: (so in another copy of
the T:) or he means, while its two extremities
are in the hand of its owner: (EM p. 91:) by
ما اخطأ, he means فِى إِخْطَائِهِ, (S in art. طول,)
or مُدَّةَ إِخْطَائِهِ: and the ل [prefixed to the ك of
comparison] is for corroboration. (EM ubi suprá.)
You say also, رَبَّقَ أَثْنَآءَ الحَبْلِ, meaning He made
loops in the middle of the rope to put upon the
necks of the young lambs or kids. (T.) ―
-b7-  Also
A bend, or place of bending, of a valley, (S, M, *
K,) and of a mountain: (S:) pl. as above: (M,
K:) and ↓ مَثَانٍ [likewise] signifies the bends of a
valley. (T, K.)
-A2-  A she-camel that has brought
forth twice, (S,) or two, (M,) or a second time:
(K:) or, as some say, that has brought forth
once: but the former is more analogical: (M:)
one does not say ثِلْثٌ [as meaning “ that has
brought forth thrice ”], nor use any similar epithet
above this: (S, TA:) pl. ثُنَآءٌ, like ظُؤَارٌ pl. of
ظِئْرٌ, accord. to Sb, (M, TA,) and أَثْنَآءٌ accord. to
others: (TA:) in like manner it is applied to a
woman, (S, M,) metaphorically: (M:) and to
the she-camel's second young one: (S, M:) accord.
to As, as related by A'Obeyd, a she-camel that
has brought forth once: also that has brought
forth twice: [so says Az, but he adds,] but what
I have heard from the Arabs is this; that they
term a she-camel that has brought forth her first
young one بِكْر; and her first young one, her بِكْر;
and when she brought forth a second, she is
termed ثِنْىٌ; and her young one, her ثِنْى: and
this is what is correct. (T.) [Hence the saying,]
مَا هٰذَا الأَمْرُ مِنْكَ بِكْرًا وَلَا ثِنْيًا (tropical:)  This thing, or
affair, is not thy first nor thy second. (A and TA
in art. بكر.) ―

ثُنًى: see ثِنًى: ―

اِثْنَانِ.
ثِنًى The repetition of a thing; doing it one
time after another: (Aboo-Sa'eed, TA:) or a
thing, or an affair, done twice: (S, Msb, TA:)
this is the primary signification: (TA:) and ↓ ثُنًى
signifies the same. (IB, TA.) It is said in a
trad., لَا ثِنَى فِى الصَّدَقَةِ There shall be no repetition in the taking of the poor-rate; (IAth, TA;)
[i. e.] the poor-rate shall not be taken twice in one
year: (As, Ks, T, S, M, Mgh, K:) or two she-camels shall not be taken in the place of one for
the poor-rate: (M, IAth, K: *) or there shall be
no retracting of an alms; or no revoking it:
(Mgh, K, * TA:) this last is the meaning accord.
to Aboo-Sa'eed, (Mgh, TA,) i. e. Ed-Dareeree,
(Mgh,) who, in explaining this trad., as relating
to the giving an alms to a man and then desiring
to take it back, says he does not deny that ثِنًى
has the meaning first assigned to it above in this
paragraph. (TA.) ―

ثُنْيَا a subst. from اِسْتِثْنَآءٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb;) as
also ↓ ثَنْوَى; the former with damm, and the latter

as also ↓ ثَنِيَّةٌ, (T, K,) or ↓ ثُنْيَةٌ, (accord. to one
copy of the T,) and ↓ مَثْنَوِيَّةٌ: (T:) so in the
saying, حَلَفَ يَمِينًا لَيْسَ فِيهَا ثُنْيَا and ↓ ثُنْوَى and
↓ ثَنِيَّةٌ or ↓ ثُنْيَةٌ and ↓ مَثْنَوِيَّةٌ [he swore an oath in
which there was not an exception]; for when the
swearer says, “By God I will not do such and
such things unless God will otherwise,” he reverses what he [first] says by God's willing otherwise: (T: [see 10:]) [and so in the saying,]
↓ حَلْفَةٌ غَيْرُ ذَاتِ مَثْنَوِيَّةٍ a swearing not made
lawful [by an exception]: (M:) [so too in the
saying,] ↓ بَيْعٌ مَا فِيهِ مَثْنَوِيَّةٌ [and ثُنْيَا &c.] (K in
art. لحج) a sale in which there is not an exception: (TA in that art.:) or ثُنْيَا signifies a thing
excepted, (M, Mgh, K,) whatever it be; (K) as
also ↓ ثَنْوَى, (M, K,) with و substituted for ى,
(M,) or ↓ ثُنْوَى, (so in the TA, [but probably
through inadvertence,]) and ↓ ثَنِيَّةٌ, (M, K,) or
↓ ثُنْيَةٌ. (TA.) In a sale, it is unlawful when it is
the exception of a thing unknown; and when one
sells a slaughtered camel for a certain price and
excepts the head and extremities: (T, TA:) or
when an exception is made from things sold
without measuring or weighting or numbering:
and in a contract with another for labour upon
land on the condition of sharing the produce, it is
when one excepts a certain measure after the half
or the third. (IAth, TA.) The saying of Mo-
hammad, مَنِ اسْتَثْنَى فَلَهُ ثُنْيَاهُ means Whoso
maketh an exception, his shall be what he excepteth: (M, TA: *) as, for instance, when one
says, “I divorce her thrice, save once: ” or “ I
emancipate them, except such a one. ” (TA.) ―
-b2-
It also means particularly The head and legs of a
slaughtered camel; (T, M, * K;) because the
seller of the camel used, in the Time of Ignorance, to except them; (T;) and IF adds, but
incorrectly, the back-bone: (Sgh, TA:) whence,
applied to a she-camel, مُذَكَّرَةُ الثُّنْيَا, (T, M,)
meaning Resembling the make of the male in [the
largeness of] her head and legs; (Th, M;) or

male camel in thickness. (T.) [Also, app., The
exception, or omission, of a day, in irrigation:

↓ ثَنِيَّةٌ signifies also A palm-tree that is excepted
from a bargain. (M, K.) And The martyrs
whom God has excepted from those who shall fall
down dead or swooning: (M, K:) these, accord.
to Kaab, are اللّٰهِ فِى الأَرْضِ ↓ ثَنِيّةُ [those whom
God has excepted on the earth]; (T, M;) alluded
to in the Kur [xxxix. 68], where it is said, “And
the horn shall be blown, and those who are in the
heavens and those on the earth shall fall down
dead, or swooning, except those whom God shall
please [to except]. ” (T.)

either or these is used as the proper name of a

ثَنَآءٌ, [and accord. to the CK, ثَنِيَّةٌ, but this is a
mistranscription for تَثْنِيَة, inf. n. of ثَنَّى, and تَثْنِيَة
is a mistake for تَثْبِيَة, inf. n. of ثَبَّى, (see 4,)]
Praise, eulogy, or commendation, (T, S, M, Msb,
K,) of a man, (T, M,) and of God: (T:) and
dispraise, censure, or discommendation, (T, M,
Msb, K,) of a man: (T, M:) or the former only:
(M, K:) or more frequently the former: (Msb:)
so termed because it is repeated: (Ham p. 696:)
that it relates to good speech and evil is asserted
by many. (TA.)
ثُنَآءُ and ثُنَآءَ: see مَثْنَى.
ثِنَآءٌ The cord, or rope, with which a camel's
fore shank and his arm are bound together; (S,
K;) and the like; consisting of a folded, or
doubled, cord, or rope: each of the folds, or
duplicatures, thereof would be thus termed if the
word were used in the sing. form: (S:) Ibn-EsSeed [in the CK, erroneously, Ibn-Es-Seedeh]
allows it; and therefore it is given as on his
authority in the K: (TA:) and Lth allows it;
but in this instance he allows what the Arabs do
not allow: (T:) you say, عَقَلْتُ البَعِيرَ بِثِنَايَيْنِ,
meaning I bound together the fore shanks and
the arms of the camel with a rope, (S,) or with
two ropes, (M, [but this is probably a mistake of
a copyist,]) or with the two ends of a rope; (AZ,
T, S, M;) without ء because the word has no
sing.: (Kh, Sb, T, S:) Lth allows one's saying
بِثِنَآءَيْنِ also; but the Basrees and Koofees [in
general] agree that it is without ء: (T:) IB says
that it has no sing. because it is a single rope,
with one end of which one fore leg is bound, and
with the other end the other leg; and IAth says
the like: (TA:) this rope is also called ↓ ثِنَايَةٌ;
but a single rope for binding one fore shank and
arm is not thus called. (T.) See also ثِنَايَةٌ. ―

And see ثَانٍ.
-A2-  The فِنَآء [or court, or open or
wide space, in front, or extending from the sides,]
(M, K,) of a house: (M:) [in the CK, الغِناءُ is
erroneously put for الفِناءُ:] accord. to IJ, from
ثَنَى, aor. يَثْنِى, because there one is turned back,
by its limits, from expatiating; but A'Obeyd
holds the ث to be a substitute for ف. (M.)
ثَنِىٌّ Shedding his tooth called the ثَنِيَّة [q. v.]:
(S, M, Msb:) or that has shed the tooth so called:
(T, Mgh:) applied to a camel &c., as follows:
(T, S, M, &c.:) or, as some say, to any animal
that has shed that tooth, except man: (M:) fem.
with ة: (T, S, M, Msb, K:) a camel in the sixth
year; (T, S, M, IAth, Mgh, Msb, K;) the least
age at which he may be sacrificed: (T:) and a
horse in the fourth year; (IAar, T, Mgh, K;) or
in the third year: (S, Msb:) and a cloven-hoofed
animal, (S, Mgh, Msb,) or a sheep or goat and
an animal of the bovine kind, [respecting which
last see عَضْبٌ,] (T, IAth, K,) in the third year:
(T, S, IAth, Mgh, Msb, K:) or a sheep and a
goat, (M,) the latter accord. to the persuasion of
Ahmad [Ibn-Hambal], (TA,) in the second year:
(M:) and a gazelle after the age at which he is
termed جَذَعٌ: (M: [see شَصَرٌ:]) in all cases,
after what is termed جَذَعٌ and before what is
termed رَبَاعٍ: (Mgh:) pl. (masc., S, TA) ثُنْيَانٌ
and ثِنَآءٌ (S, M, Mgh, Msb) and ثُنَآءٌ, and, accord.
to Sb, ثُنٍ; (M;) and pl. fem. ثَنِيَّاتٌ. (S.)
الثُّنَىُّ, or الثُّنِىُّ: see اِثْنَانِ.
ثَنِيَّةٌ I. q. عَقَبَةٌ: (AA, M, Mgh, K:) or the
latter means a long mountain that lies across the
road, and which the road traverses; and the
former, any such mountain that is traversed:
(T:) so called because it lies before the road, and
crosses it; or because it turns away him who
traverses it: (Mgh:) or the road of what is
termed عَقَبَة: (S; and so in copies of the K:) or
a high road of what is thus termed: (K accord.
to the TA:) or a road in, or upon, a mountain,
(M, K,) like that which is termed نَقْبٌ [q. v.]:
(M:) or a road to a mountain: (M, K:) or a
mountain (M, K) itself: (M:) or a part of a
mountain that requires one, in traversing it, to
ascend and descend; as though it turned the
course of journeying: (Er-Rághib, TA:) pl. ثَنَايَا:
(T, S:) which signifies also [such roads as are
termed] مَدَارِج. (T.) Hence the phrase, فُلَانٌ
طَلَّاعُ الثَّنَايَا Such a one rises to eminences, or to
lofty things or circumstances, or to the means of
attaining such things; like the phrase طَلَّاعُ أَنْجُدٍ
[q. v.]: (S:) or, like the latter phrase, is accustomed to embark in, or undertake, or to surmount,
or master, lofty and difficult things: (Mgh:) or
is hardy, strong, or sturdy; one who embarks in,
or undertakes, great affairs. (TA. [See an ex.
under the heading of اِبْنُ جَلَا, in art. جلو: and
see also art. طلع.]) ―
-b2-  Also, (T, S, M, &c.,) pl.
ثَنَايَا (T, S, Mgh, Msb) and ثَنِيَّاتٌ, (Msb,) One of
certain teeth, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) the foremost in the mouth, (M,) [namely, the central
incisors,] four in number, (T, M, Mgh, Msb,) to
man, and to the camel, (T, M, &c.,) and to the
wild beast, (M,) in the fore part of the mouth,
(T, Mgh, K,) two above and two below: (T, M,
Mgh, K:) so called as being likened to the ثَنِيَّة
of a mountain, in form and hardness; (TA;) or
because each of them is placed next to its fellow.
(Mgh.)

&c.)
-A3-  See also ثُنْيَا, in five places.
ثِنَايَةٌ A cord, or rope, of goats' hair (شَعَر), or
of wool, (S, K,) or of other material; (K;) as
also ↓ ثِنَآءٌ (K) and ↓ مِثْنَاةٌ and ↓ مَثْنَاةٌ; (M, K;)
which last is explained by IAar as signifying
[simply] a cord, or rope: (M:) [or] the first
has the meaning assigned to it above, voce ثِنَآءٌ;
syn. with ثِنَايَانِ: and signifies also a long rope;
whence the saying of Zuheyr, describing the [she-camel termed] سَانِيَة,
تَمْطُو الرِّشَآءَ وَتُجْرِى فِى ثِنَايَتِهَا
مِنَ المَحَالَةِ قَبًّا رَائِدًا قَلِقَا
(T,) meaning [She draws the well-rope, and
causes to run,] with her ثناية upon her, (ISk, T,)
[a wabbling, unsteady, sheave (?) of the large
pulley;] the ثناية here being a rope of which the
two ends are tied to the saddle (قَتَب) of the
سانية; the [upper] end of the well-rope being tied
to its ↓ مِثْنَاة [which here means the folded middle
part]: (T:) but Aboo-Sa'eed says that it [here]
means a piece of wood by which are connected the
two extremities of the cheeks, or side-pieces, (طرفا
الميلين, [the latter of which words I here render
conjecturally, supposing it to be similar in meaning to القَعْوِ or القَعْوَيْنِ,]) above the محالة, and
a similar piece below; the محالة and [qu. or]
the sheave turning between the tow pieces thus
called. (T, in a later portion of the art.)
ثُنَائِىٌّ [a rel. n. from اِثْنَانِ, anomalously formed,
but analogous with other rel. ns. from ns. of
number, as رُبَاعِىٌّ ثُلَاثِىٌّ, &c., Of, or relating to,
two things]. ―
-b2-  كَلِمَةٌ ثُنَائِيَّةٌ A word comprising,
or composed of, two letters; as يَدٌ, and دُمْ [or دَمٌ?].
(TA.)
ثِنْتَانِ a fem of اِثْنَانِ, q. v.
ثَانٍ [act. part. n. of 1; Doubling, or folding;
&c.]. Hence, هُوَ ثَانٍ رِجْلَهُ While he was bending
his leg before rising, or standing up. (TA from a
trad.) [And جَآءَ ثَانِىَ عِطْفِهِ: see art. عطف.]
One says of a horseman who has bent the neck of
his beast on the occasion of his vehement running,
جَآءَ ثَانِىَ العِنَانِ [He came bending the rein by
pulling it with both hands a little apart]: (T:)
or جَآءَ ثَانِيًا مِنْ عِنَانِهِ [he came bending a part of
his rein]. (S.) And of the horse himself, one
says, جَآءَ سَابِقًا ثَانِيًا, i. e. He came outstripping,
with bent neck, by reason of briskness; because
when he is fatigued, he stretches out his neck; and
when he is not fatigued nor jaded by running,
but comes in his first run, he bends his neck:
and hence the saying of the poet,
وَمَنْ يَفْخَرْ بِمِثْلِ أَبِى وَجَدِّى
يَجِئْ قَبْلَ السَّوَابِقِ وَهُوَ ثَانِى
i. e. [And he who glories in the like of my father
and my grandfather, let him come before the
mares that outstrip,] he being like the horse that
outstrips [all others], with bent neck; or it may
mean, he bending the neck of his horse which has
outstripped the others. (T.) [Hence also,] شَاةٌ
ثَانِيَةٌ A sheep, or goat, bending the neck, not in
consequence of disease. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  [Also Second;
the ordinal of two: fem. with ة.] You say, هٰذَا
ثَانِى هٰذَا [This is the second of this]; i. e. this is
what has made this a pair, or couple: (M:) and
فُلَانٌ (T) or هٰذَا (S) ثَانِى اثْنَيْنِ, (T, S,) i. e.
Such a one, or this, is [the second of two, or] one
of the two; (T, S;) like as you say ثَالِتُ ثَلَاثَةٍ;
and so on to عَشَرَة: but not with tenween: (S:)
[i. e.,] you may not say ثانٍ اثْنَيْنِ: (T: [see
ثَالِثٌ:]) but if the two [terms] disagree, you may
use either mode; (S;) you may say, هٰذَا (S) or
هُوَ (Mgh) ثَانِى وَاحِدٍ and ثَانٍ وَاحِدًا, (S, Mgh,)
i. e. This has become a second to one, (S,) [or
rather, becomes &c. (i. e. يَثْنِى rather than ثَنَى),]
or he, or it, makes one, with himself, or itself, to
be two. (Mgh.) ↓ ثِنَآء also signifies the same in
a trad. respecting the office of commander, or
governor, or prince; where it is said, أَوَّلُهَا مَلَامَةٌ
وَثِنَاؤُهَا نَدَامَةٌ وَثِلَاثُهَا عَذابُ يَوْمِ القِيَامَةِ إِلَّا مَنْ عَدَلَ,
i. e. [The first result thereof is blame, and] the
second [is regret, and] the third [is the punishment of the day of resurrection, except in the
case of him who acts equitably]: so says Sh.
(T.) ―
-b3-  And الثَّوَانِى [pl. of الثَّانِيَةُ] signifies [The
second horns;] the horns that are [next] after
the أَوَائِل. (M.) ―
-b4-  [ثَانِىَ عَشَرَ and ثَانِيَةَ عَشْرَةَ,
the former masc. and the latter fem., meaning
Twelfth, are subject to the same rules as ثَالِثَ
عَشَرَ and its fem., explained in art. ثلث.]
أَثْنَآءٌ pl. of ثِنْىٌ and of اِثْنَانِ: and also syn.
with this latter, q. v.
اِثْنِىٌّ: see ثَنَوِىٌّ.
اِثْنَانِ a noun of number; (S, Msb;) applied to
the dual number; (Msb;) meaning [Two;] the
double of وَاحِدٌ; (M, K;) with a conjunctive ا
[when not immediately preceded by a quiescence,
written اثْنَانِ]; (T, S, Msb;) but this is sometimes made disjunctive when connected with a
preceding word by poetic license: (T, S:) of the
masc. gender: (S:) fem. اِثْنَتَانِ, (T, S, Msb,) in
which, also, the ا is conjunctive; (T, Msb;) and
↓ ثِنْتَانِ; (T S, M, Msb, K;) the latter sometimes
used, (T,) [much less frequently than the former,
though the only fem. form mentioned in the M
and K,] and of the dial. of Temeem; (Msb;)
like as one says, هِىَ ابْنَةُ فُلَانٍ and هِىَ بِنْتُهُ: (T:)
the ت in the dual is a substitute for the final
radical, ى, (M, TA,) as it is in أَسْنَتُوا, the only
other instance of this substitution except in words
of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ: (Sb, M, TA:) in اِثْنَانِ,
the final radical, ى is suppressed: (Msb:) it
has no sing.: (Lth, T:) if it were allowable to
assign to it a sing., it would be اِثْنٌ [for the
masc.] and اِثْنَةٌ [for the fem.], like اِبْنٌ and اِبْنَةٌ:
(S:) accord. to some, (Msb,) it is originally
ثِنْىٌ; (T, Msb, CK;) and hence the dual ثِنْتَانِ:
(Msb:) or it is originally ثَنَىٌ, (M, Msb, and so
in a copy of the K,) the conjunctive ا being then
substituted for the ى whence the dual اثْنَانِ,
like ابْنَانِ: (Msb:) this is shown by the form of
its pl., which is أَثْنَآءٌ, (M, K,) like أَبْنَآءٌ [pl. of
ابْنٌ, which is originally بَنَىٌ or بَنَوٌ,] and آخَآءٌ
[pl. of أَخٌ, which is originally أَخَوٌ]. (M.) In
the saying in the Kur [xvi. 53], لَا تَتَّخِذُوا إِٰلهَيْنِ
اثْنَيْنِ [Take not to yourselves two gods], the last
word is added as a corroborative. (M.) The
phrase ثِنْتَا حَنْظَلٍ occurs, by poetic license, for
اِثْنَتَانِ مِنْ حَنْظَلٍ, meaning حَنْظَلَتَانِ [Two colo-
cynths]. (S.) You say also, القَدَحِ ↓ شَرِبْتُ أَثْنَآءَ,
and شَرِبْتُ اثْنَىْ هٰذَا القَدَحِ, meaning [I drank]
twice as much as the bowl, and as this bowl: and
in like manner, شَرِبْتُ اثْنَىْ مُدِّ البَصْرَةِ and اثْنَيْنِ
بِمُدِّ البَصْرَةِ [I drank twice the quantity of the مُدّ
of El-Basrah]. (M.) And a poet says,
↓ فَمَا حُلِبَتْ إِلَّا الثَّلَاثَةَ وَالثُّنَى
وَلَا قُيِّلَتْ إِلَّا قَرِيبًا مَقَالُهَا
meaning [And she was not milked save] three
vessels and two, [nor was she given her middaydrink save when her midday-resting was near.]
(IAar, M.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (Msb,) يَوْمُ الاِثْنَيْنِ, (S,
Msb,) or الاِثْنَانِ alone, (M, K,) One of the days
of the week; [the second; namely, Monday;]
because the first, with the Arabs, is الأَحَدُ; (M;)
as also ↓ الثِّنَى, like إِلَى; (K;) so in the copies
of the K; [or,] accord. to some, ↓ الثُّنِىُّ, [originally الثُّنُوىُ,] of the measure فُعُول, like ثُدِىٌّ
[pl. of ثَدْىٌ], is used in this sense; (TA;) or
↓ اليَوْمُ الثُّنَىُّ, [so in the M, accord. to the TT,]
mentioned by Sb, on the authority of certain of
the Arabs: (M:) the pl. is أَثْنَآءٌ and أَثَانِينُ, (M,
K,) the latter mentioned on the authority of Th:
but it has no dual: and those who say أَثْنَآءٌ form
this pl. from الاِثْنُ, although this has not been in
use: (M:) or it has neither dual nor pl., (S,
Msb,) being itself a dual; (S;) but if you would
form a pl. from it, you would regard it as itself a
sing., and make its pl. أَثَانِينُ: (S, Msb:) IB says
that أَثَانِينُ has not been heard [from the Arabs],
and is only mentioned by Fr, on the ground of
analogy; that it is far-fetched in respect of analogy;
and that the pl. heard is أَثْنَآءٌ: Seer and others
mention, as heard from the Arabs, إِنَّهُ لَيَصُومُ الأَثْنَآءَ
[Verily he fasts on the Mondays]. (TA.) الثنين
in يوم الثنين has no dim. (Sb, S in art. امس.)
IJ says that the article ال in الثنين is not redundant, though the word is not an epithet:
Abu-l-'Abbás says that the prefixing of the article
in this case is allowable because the virtual meaning is اليَوْمُ الثَّانِى [the second day]. (M.) The
saying اليَوْمُ الاِثْنَانِ means The name of to-day [is
الاثنان]; and is like the saying اليَوْمُ يَوْمَانِ [to-day
is two days] and اليَوْمُ خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ مِنَ الشَّهْرِ [to-day
is fifteen of the month]. (Sb, M.) Sometimes,
يَوْمُ اثْنَيْنِ, without the article ال, occurs in poetry.
(M, K.) When a pronoun refers to الاثنان [as
meaning Monday], this word may be treated in
two ways, [as a sing. and as a dual,] but the more
chaste way is to treat it as a sing., as meaning
the day: (Msb:) [thus,] Aboo-Ziyád used to say,
مَضَى الاِثْنَانِ بِمَا فِيهِ [Monday passed with what
occurred in it]; making it sing. and masc.; and
thus he did in the case of every day of the week,
except that he made الجُمْعَة fem.: Abu-I-Jarráh
used to say, مَضَى الاِثْنَانِ بِمَا فِيهِمَا, treating the
word as a numeral; and thus he treated the third
and fourth and fifth days, saying in each of these
cases بِمَا فِيهِنَّ. (M.) ―

اِثْنَوِىٌّ, [with ا when not immediately preceded

(TA.)
مَثْنَى (S, Mgh) and ↓ ثُنَآءُ (T, S) [Two and
two; two and two together; or two at a time and
two at a time]: they are imperfectly decl., in like
manner as [مَثْلَثُ and] ثُلَاثُ, as explained in art.
ثلث; (S, TA;) [because] changed from the original form of اِثْنَانِ اثْنَانِ; (T, Mgh, TA;) or
because of their having the quality of epithets and
deviating from the original form of اِثْنَانِ; (Sb, S
in art. ثلث, q. v.;) or because they deviate from
their original as to the letter and the meaning;
the original word being changed as above stated,
and the meaning being changed to اِثْنَانِ اثْنَانِ.
(S ibid.) You say, جَاؤُوا مَثْنَى and ↓ ثُنَآءَ (M, K)
or مَثْنَى مَثْنَى, (S,) but this is a repetition of the
word only, not of the meaning, (Mgh,) and in
like manner one says of women, (M, K, *) i. e.
They came two [and] two. (S, M, K.) And it is
said in a trad., صَلَاةُ اللَّيْلِ مَثْنَى مَثْنَى, i. e. The

three applications, accord. to A'Obeyd: (T, Mgh:)
it signifies The Kur-án altogether; (A'Obeyd,
T, S, M, Mgh, K;) so in the Kur xxxix 24;
(A'Obeyd, T, Mgh;) meaning that the mention
of reward and punishment is repeated, or reiterated, in it; (Fr, T;) or so called because the
verse of mercy is conjoined with that of punishment; (S;) or because narratives and promises
and threats are repeated in it; or because one
peruses it repeatedly without being wearied:
(Mgh:) or it signifies, (M, K,) or signifies also,
(A'Obeyd, T, S, Mgh,) [the first chapter, called]
the فَاتِحَة, (A'Obeyd, T, S, M, Mgh,) or الحَمْدُ,
(K,) which means the same; (TA;) so in the
Kur xv. 87; (A'Obeyd, T, Mgh;) because it is
repeated, or recited twice, in every [act of prayer
termed a] رَكْعَة, (Fr, Zj, AHeyth, T, S,) or with
every chapter, (Th, M,) or in every prayer;
(Mgh;) or because containing praise of God:
(Zj, T, Mgh:) [but see السَّبْعُ المَثَانِى voce سَبْعَةٌ:]
