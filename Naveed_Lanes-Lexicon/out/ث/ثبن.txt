ثَبِنَ, inf. n. ثَبْنٌ and ثِبَانٌ,

ثَبَنَ, (TA,) he put a thing into the receptacle
[thereof] and carried it before him; as also
↓ تثبّن: and in like manner, he folded and sewed
over a thing the doubled upper border of his
trousers in front: (K, * TA:) or شَيْئًا ↓ تثبّن has
this last meaning; and signifies also he put a
thing into a ثِبَان [q. v.] and carried it before
him: (S:) and ثَبَنَ فِى ثَوْبِهِ, aor. and inf. ns.
as above; (M;) and فِيهِ ↓ اثبن, (M, K, as in the
CK,) accord. to [some of] the copies of the K

ثُبْنَةٌ: see what next follows, in four places.
ثِبَانٌ A receptacle, such as when one folds the
skirt of his shirt and puts in it a thing and
carries it before him: (S:) or the part, of the
garment, which is the place wherein one carries,
when he wraps it around his body, or puts a
portion thereof under his right shoulder and
another portion over his left shoulder, then folds
before him a part of it, and puts a thing in it;
as also ↓ ثُبْنَةٌ: (M:) or the part, of one's garment,
which is the place wherein he carries; folding its
extremity, and sewing it, before him, and then
putting in it some dates or other things: as also
↓ ثَبِينٌ and ↓ ثُبْنَةٌ: (K:) and the extremity of
the [garment called] رِدَآء when one folds it before
him and sews it [and puts a thing in it to carry]:
(M:) or a receptacle in which one carries a thing
before him; (T:) and ↓ ثُبْنَةٌ, of which the pl.
is ثُبَانٌ, (T,) or its pl. is ثُبَنٌ, like as the pl of
خُبْنَةٌ [which has a similar meaning] is خُبَنٌ,
(Har p. 427,) the doubled upper border of the
trousers or waist-wrapper, in which one carries
[before him] fruit and other things: [see also
خُبْنَةٌ:] or, as some say, ثِبَانٌ does not signify
a receptacle, but dates that are put and carried
in a receptacle or some other thing: and sometimes what a man carries in his sleeve; and ↓ ثُبْنَةٌ
signifies only what one carries before him, that
is little in quantity: and what is great is not
called ثِبَانٌ. (T.) It is said in a trad. of 'Omar,
إِذَا مَرَّ أَحَدُكُمْ بِحَائِطٍ فَلْيَأْكُلْ مِنْهُ وَلَا يَتَّخِذْ ثِبَانًا
[When any one of you passes by a garden
of palm-trees, let him eat thereof, but not
take for himself, or make, a ثبان]: i. e.,
when a necessitous hungry person passes by
a man's garden of palm-trees, he may eat of
their dates what will repel his hunger. (T.
[See also another reading voce خُبْنَةٌ.]) And one
says, قَدِمَ فُلَانٌ بِثِبَانٍ فِى ثَوْبِهِ مَا أَدْرِى مَا هُوَ
[Such a one came with a ثبان in his garment: I
know not what it was]. (T.)
ثَبِينٌ: see ثِبَانٌ.
مَثْبَنَةٌ A bag in which a woman puts her mirror
and apparatus: (M, K:) of the dial. of ElYemen. (M.)

ثَبَوْتُ لَهُ خَيْرًا بَعْدَ خَيْرٍ, or شَرًّا, I sent him

تَثْبِيَةٌ, [inf. n. of ثبّى, mentioned in the T
and K, in all its senses, in art. ثبى, and so in the
M, except in the first of the following senses,
which is there mentioned in art. ثبى and also in
art. ثبو,] The act of collecting (K, TA) in successive assemblages (↓ ثُبَةً ثُبَةً). (TA.) You say,
ثبّاهُ He collected it, namely, a thing, (M,) and
water: (M * and TA in art. ثبو:) and he added
to it, and collected it. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-  The collecting what is good: and also, what is bad, or evil:
thus bearing two contr. significations. (K.) ―
-b3-
[And hence,] The praising a man in his life-time:
(AA, S, K:) or praising him time after time in
his life-time: (TA:) or praising him much; as
though relating to him collections (↓ ثُبَات) of
praise: (Z, TA;) or the mentioning of the sundry
good qualities or actions: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and
the magnifying [a person]; or honouring [him].
(T, * K.) You say, ثبّى الرَّجُلَ, (M,) or ثبّى عَلَى
الرَّجُلِ, (T,) He praised the man in his life-time:
(T, M:) because the doing so implies the collecting his good qualities or actions. (T, * M.) ―
-b4-
[Hence also the contr. signification,] The blaming,
or censuring, much; collecting blame, or censure,
from this and that source. (TA. [The act.
part. n. is rendered in the M agreeably with this
explanation.]) ―
-b5-  The act of completing [and augmenting a thing]. (K.) You say, ثَبِّ مَعْرُوفَكَ
Complete and augment [thy beneficence, or bounty,
or favour]. (T.) And ثبّى اللّٰهُ لَكَ النِّعَمَ [May
God complete and augment to thee benefits, or
blessings: or] may God send to thee benefits, or
blessings. (TA.) [See also 1.] ―
-b6-  The putting
a thing into a good, right, or sound, state, and
augmenting it. (T, K. *) ―
-b7-  ثبّى المَالَ He kept,
preserved, guarded, or took care of, the property.
(Kr, M.)
-A2-  ثَبَّيْتُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ, (As, S,) inf. n. تَثْبِيَةٌ,
(As, T, S, M, K,) I kept constantly, or perseveringly, to the thing. (As, T, S, M, K.) ―
-b2-  The
inf. n. signifies also The keeping, (T,) or pursuing,
(K,) the way, course, mode of acting, or the like,
of one's father: (T, K:) or the doing, or acting,
like one's father. (M.) ―
-b3-  Also The complaining
of one's state, or case, and of one's want; and
asking aid, or assistance, and vengeance, or avengement. (K.) [One of the meanings assigned to
the verb by Golius, as on the authority of the K,
and by Freytag after him, is “ Disposuit paravitque
se: ” app. from the former's having found الاِسْتِعْدَادُ
written in a copy of the K for الاِسْتِعْدَآءُ.]
-A3-  أَنَا
أَعْرِفُهُ تَثْبِيَةً I know him, or it, with a seeming, not
a certain, knowledge. (T, TA.)
ثُبَةٌ A company (T, S, M, K) of men; (T, M;)
as also ↓ أُثْبِيَّةٌ; (M, K; [in the CK erroneously
written اَثْبِيَة;]) and أُثْئِيَّةٌ: (TA:) a company in
a state of separation or dispersion; or a distinct
body, or company, of men: (T:) and a troop of
horsemen; such as is termed عُصْبَة: (M, K: [in
the CK, العَصَبَةُ is erroneously put for العُصْبَةُ:])
the pl. is ثُبَاتٌ and ثُبُونَ (T, S, M, K) and ثِبُونَ
(S, M) and (the pl. of أُثْبِيَّةٌ, TA) أَثَابِىُّ and أَثَابِيَةٌ,
in which last the ة is a substitute for the last ى
[of أَثَابِىُّ]: (M, TA:) or [accord. to some,] أَثَابِىُّ,
which signifies companies, has no sing.; but, as
some say, its sing. is ↓ أَثْبِيَّةٌ, of the measure أُفْعُولَةٌ,
[originally أُثْبُويَةٌ,] which means  a numerous company: (Ham p. 796:) [it is also said that] ثُبًى is
a pl. of ثُبَةٌ as meaning a company; (L in art.
ثوب, and Ham p. 271;) and hence the phrase
الثُّبَى العَالِى, for الثُّبَى العَالِيَةُ, [the high, or exalted, companies,] the former word being made
masc. because it is like زُلَمٌ [which is sing. and
masc.]; but some say that this word here means
the assemblies of the nobles: (Ham ubi suprá:)
IAar says, الثُّبَى العَالِى مِنْ مَجَالِسِ الأَشْرَافِ; but
[ISd observes,] this is extraordinary, and I have
not heard it except in the poetry of El-Find EzZimmánee. (M.) Accord. to some, it is from
ثَابَ, being originally ثُوبَةٌ; and its dim. is ثُوَيْبَةٌ:
(T:) or it is originally ثُبَىٌ: (S:) accord. to Er-Rághib, the letter elided from ثُبَةٌ as meaning “ a
company,” but not as relating to a wateringtrough or tank, is ى; and ISd holds it to be ى:
and [if so,] its dim. is ↓ ثُبَيَّةٌ: (TA:) [but ISd
adds,] IJ says that the elided letter is و, because
it is this in most cases, as in أَبٌ and أَخٌ and سَنَةٌ
and عِضَةٌ &c. (M in arts. ثبو and ثبى.) [See
also art. ثوب. It seems to signify also An assemblage, or a collection, of things of any kind:] see 2,
in two places. ―
-b2-  Also The middle of a wateringtrough or tank, (T, S, M, K,) to which the water
returns [when it has been emptied], (S,) or to
which what remains of the water returns: (T:)
and the place where the water collects in a valley
or low ground: (Aboo-Kheyreh, T:) but this is
from ثَابَ; (T, S; *) the ة is a substitute for the
و, the medial radical, which is suppressed; for it
is originally ثُوَبٌ: (S:) or it is originally ثُوبَةٌ:
(T:) or it may be from ثَبَّيْتُ “ I collected: ”
but Aboo-Is-hák makes it to be from ثَابَ المَآءُ,
aor. يَثُوبُ; and this he infers to be the case from
their saying that the dim. is ثُوَيْبَةٌ. (M.) [See
also art. ثوب.]
ثَبِىٌّ One who praises men much [while they are
living: see 2]. (TA.)
ثُبَيَّةٌ: see ثُبَةٌ, of which it is said to be the dim.
أُثْبِيَّةٌ: see ثُبَةٌ, in two places.
مُثَبًّى Property collected together. (TA.)
