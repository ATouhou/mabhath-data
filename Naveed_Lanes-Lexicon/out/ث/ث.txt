The fourth letter of the alphabet: called ثَآءٌ and
ثَا [respecting which latter see the letter ب]: the

أَثْوَآءٌ and أَثْيَآءٌ. (TA in باب الالف اللّينة.) It is
one of the letters termed مَهْمُوسَة [or non-vocal,
i. e. pronounced with the breath only, without
the voice], and of those termed لِثَوِيَّة [or gingival],
which are ث and ذ and ظ. (TA at the commencement of ف.) ―

حُفَالَةٌ; and for س as in the instance of جُثْمَانٌ
and جُسْمَانٌ; and for other letters. (TA in the
latter place.)
