رِبْعٌ and خِمْسٌ &c.] See also 4.
ثَمَنٌ The price of a thing; i. e. the thing that
the seller receives in return for the thing sold,
whether money or a commodity; (Er-Rághib,
TA;) the ثَمَن of a thing sold: (S:) and also
(Er-Rághib, TA) a compensation, or substitute,
(Mgh, Msb, Er-Rághib, TA,) whatever it be, for
a thing, (Er-Rághib, TA,) i. e., for a thing that
is sold; but in the sense commonly known, such
as it is incumbent upon one to pay, of pieces of
silver, and of gold [or other money]; not commodities and the like: (Mgh:) or the value, or
worth, of a thing; (K;) its قِيمَة: (T:) or the
estimated value, or worth, of a thing, by mutual
consent, even though it be really excessive or
deficient; whereas the قِيمَة is its real value or
worth, its equivalent: (MF:) pl. أَثْمَانٌ (T, Mgh,
Msb, K) and أَثْمُنٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the latter used
only as a pl. of pauc., (Msb,) and [so] أَثْمِنَةٌ.
(CK: not in the TA.) The saying in the Kur
[ii. 38 and v. 48], وَلَا تَشْتَرُوا بِآيَاتِى ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا is
metaphorical, meaning (tropical:)  And take ye not in exchange for my signs a small substitute: [i. e.
purchase not in exchange for belief in my word
the happiness, or enjoyments, of the present life.]
(Mgh.) With respect to this saying, Fr remarks,
when ثَمَنًا occurs in the Kur, with بِ prefixed to
the name of the thing sold or bought, in most cases
it relates to two things whereof neither is a ثمن
in the sense commonly known, i. e., such as
pieces of gold and of silver: and such is the case
when you say, اِشْتَرَيْتُ ثَوْبًا بِكِسَآءٍ [I purchased a
garment with a كساء, q. v.]: either of these
may be termed a ثمن for the other: but in
speaking of pieces of silver and of gold, you
prefix the ب to the ثمن [only]; as is done in
[the chapter of] Yoosuf, [i. e. ch. xii., v. 20,
where it is said,] وَشَرَوْهُ بِثَمَنٍ بَخْسٍ دَرَاهِمَ مَعْدُودَةٍ
[And they sold him for a deficient, or an insufficient, price: for pieces of silver not many, so as
to require their being weighed, but few, and therefore counted]: for pieces of silver are always a
ثمن: and when you purchase pieces of silver
and of gold with the like, you prefix the ب to
whichever of the two you will, because each of
them in this case is a purchase and a price. (T.)
ثُمُنٌ (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ ثُمْنٌ (M,
Msb, K) An eighth; an eighth part or portion;
as also ↓ ثَمِينٌ; (S, M, * Mgh, Msb, K;) agreeably with a general rule applying to fractions,
accord. to some; (M, K;) but ثَلِيثٌ was ignored
by AZ (T and S in art. ثلث) and by others,
(TA,) and so was خَمِيسٌ: (S in art. ثلث:) pl.
أَثْمَانٌ. (M, K.)
ثَمَانٍ and ثَمَانٌ: see ثَمَانِيَةٌ.
ثَمِينٌ: see ثُمُنٌ.
-A2-  Also High-priced; or of
high value; (S, TA;) and ↓ مُثْمِنٌ [signifies the
same; or] having a price, or value: (TA:) but
accord. to the Durrat el-Ghowwás, the assertion
that the former has the meaning here assigned
to it is a mistake; for it means [only] the same
as ثُمُنٌ; and a thing that has a price, or value,
is termed مثمن [app. مُثْمِنٌ, as above; but perhaps
مُثْمَنٌ, q. v.]. (Har p. 42.)
ثَمَانِيَةٌ a noun of number, well known; [meaning Eight;] as also ↓ ثَمَانٍ, (M, TA,) which is
like يَمَانٍ, (M, K,) in form: (M:) the former is
the masc. form: the latter, the fem.: (Msb:)
this is not a rel. n. [though likened above to
يَمَانٍ]: (M, K:) or it is originally a rel. n. from
الثُّمُنُ, because it is the part, or portion, that
makes seven to be eight, so that it is its eighth:
they make the first letter to be pronounced with
fet-h, because they make changes [in some other
cases] in the rel. n., (S, K,) as when they say
سُهْلِىٌّ and دُهْرِىٌّ, [which are rel. ns. of سَهْلٌ and
دَهْرٌ,] (S,) and they suppress one of the two ى
which are characteristic of the rel. n., and compensate it by the insertion of ا, as they do in the
rel. n. of اليَمَنُ [when they say يَمَانٍ, originally
يَمَانِىٌ, for يَمَنِىٌّ]: (S, K: [and the like is said
in the Mgh:]) El-Fárisee says that the ا of ثَمَانٍ
is the characteristic of the rel. n., because this
word is not a broken pl. like صَحَارٍ; and IF
assents to this, and says that were it not so, the ة
would be inseparable, as it is in عَبَاقِيَةٌ &c. (M.)
You say ثَمَانِيَةُ رِجَالٍ [Eight men], (T, S, Mgh,)
and ثَمَانِيَةُ أَيَّامٍ [eight days]. (Msb.) And when
ثمان is prefixed to another noun, its ى is retained,
like the ى in القَاضِى: (S, Msb, K:) and it is
decl. in the same manner as words of the class to
which this last belongs: (Msb:) you say ثَمَانِى نِسْوَةٍ
[Eight women], (T, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and ثَمَانِى
مِائَةٍ [eight hundred], (S, Msb, K,) [in the nom.
and gen. cases;] and رَأَيْتُ ثَمَانِىَ نِسْوَةٍ [I saw
eight women], pronouncing the fet-hah [at the
end, in this case]. (Msb.) When it is with
tenween, the ى is dropped in the nom. and gen.
cases, but it is retained in the accus. case: (S,
K:) [i. e.,] when the fem. form is not prefixed
to another noun, you say, عِنْدِى مِنَ النِّسَآءِ ثَمَانٍ
[I have with me, of women, eight], and مَرَرْتُ
مِنْهُنَّ بِثَمَانٍ [I passed by, of them, eight], and
رَأَيْتُ ثَمَانِيًا [I saw eight]. (Msb.) It sometimes
occurs, in poetry, indecl.: (S, M:) this is because
it is fancied to be a pl.; (S;) or because it is
likened, as to the letter, but not as to the meaning, to جَوَارِىَ. (M.) The people of El-Hijáz
pronounce the masc. and the fem. with nasb in
every case, in phrases like أَتَوْنِى ثَلَاثَتَهُمْ and
أَتَيْنَنِى ثَلَاثَهُنَّ; and so on to ten [inclusive]. (S
voce ثَلَاثَةٌ, q. v.) Th mentions ↓ ثَمَانٌ; (TA;)
and some instances of its occurrence are cited;
but As disallows it. (T, Mgh, TA.) كِسَآءٌ ذُو
ثَمَانٍ means A [garment of the kind called] كساء
made of eight fleeces. (T.) تُقْبِلُ بِأَرْبَعٍ وَتُدْبِرُ
بِثَمَانٍ [She advances with four and goes back
with eight] is a saying of one of the مُخَنَّثُون of
El-Medeeneh; meaning, with four creases (عُكَن)
of the belly, and with eight extremities thereof;
each crease having two extremities, towards the
two sides of the woman spoken of. (Mgh in art.
هيت.) The saying الثَّوْبُ سَبْعٌ فِى ثَمَانٍ should
properly be فِى ثَمَانِيَةٍ, (S,) which means, The
garment, or piece of cloth, is seven cubits in
length by eight spans in breadth; (Msb;) because
the length is measured by the ذِرَاع, which is fem.,
and the breadth by the شِبْر, which is masc.; but
they use the fem. when they do not mention
things; as when they say, صُمْنَا مِنَ الشَّهْرِ خَمْسًا
[We fasted, of the month, five], though meaning
days: (S:) or because ذراع is fem. in most instances, and شبر is masc. (Msb.) [But it is said
that when ثمانية means the things numbered, not
the amount of the number, it is imperfectly decl.,
being regarded as a proper name: thus] you say,
تِسْعَةُ أَكْثَرُ مِنْ ثَمَانِيَةَ [Nine things are more than
eight things]. (TA voce تِسْعَةٌ, q. v.) [See also
سِتَّةٌ.] ―
-b2-  When you make it a compound [with
the number ten], you say, عِنْدَى ثَمَانِيَةَ عَشَرَ رَجُلًا
[I have with me eighteen men]: and in the case
of the fem., you may either make the ى to be
with fet-h or make it quiescent, saying, عِنْدِى
مِنَ النِّسَآءِ ثَمَانِىَ عَشْرَةَ امْرَأَةً or ثَمَانِىْعَشْرَةَ [I have
with me, of women, eighteen women]; but the
former is the more chaste; and in one dial., the
ى is elided, on the condition of [saying ثَمَانَ
عَشْرَةَ,] making the ن to be with fet-h; (Msb;)
or in this case you say ثَمَانِ عَشْرَةَ, with kesr.
(T.) A poet says, (T, S,) namely, El-Aashà, (K,)
فَلَأَشْرَبَنَّ ثَمَانِيًا وَثَمَانِيًا
وَثَمَانِ عَشْرَةَ وَاثْنَتَيْنِ وَأَرْبَعَا
[And I will assuredly drink eight cups of wine,
(a pl. of كَأْس, which is fem., being understood,)
and eight more, and eighteen, and two, and four]:
(T, S, K: but in the S and K, وَلَقَدْ شَرِبْتُ; and
in the K, and in one copy of the S, وَثَمَانَ:) he
should properly have said ثَمَانِىَ عَشْرَةَ or ثَمَانِىْ
عَشْرَةَ, (accord. to different copies of the T and S
and K,) but he elides the ى after the dial. of him
who says طِوَالُ الأَيْدِ [for الأَيْدِى], (S, K,) and
he makes the ن to be with kesr in order to indicate the ى. (T.) ―
-b3-  The dim. of ثَمَانِيَةٌ may
be formed either by suppressing the ا, which is the
preferable way, so that you say ↓ ثُمَيْنِيَةٌ, or by
suppressing the ى, saying ↓ ثُمَيِّنَةٌ, changing the ا
into ى and incorporating into it the ى that is the
characteristic of the dim.; and you may compensate for both [of these suppressed letters by
saying ↓ ثُمَيْنِيَّةٌ and ↓ ثُمَيِّينَةٌ]. (S.) ―
-b4-  الثَّمَانِى is
also the name of A certain plant. (As, T, K.)
ثَمَانُونَ a well-known noun of number; [meaning Eighty;] sometimes used as an epithet: ElAashà says,
لَئِنْ كُنْتَ فِى جُبٍّ ثَمَانِينَ قَامَةً
وَرُقِّيتَ أَسْبَابَ السِّمَآءِ بِسُلَّمِ
[Assuredly if thou wert in a well eighty fathoms
deep, and wert made to ascend the tracts of
heaven by a ladder]: he uses it thus as meaning
deep. (TA. [But in this verse, as cited in the
present art in the TA, أَبْوَابَ is put in the place
of اسباب, which is the reading commonly known,
and given in the S and TA in art. سب, and in
the TA in art رقى-]) أَحْمَقُ مِنْ صَاحَبِ ضَأْنٍ ثَمَانِينَ
[More stupid than an owner of eighty sheep], (S,
K,) or مِنْ رَاعِى ضَأْنٍ ثَمَانِينَ [than a pastor of
eighty sheep], as in some of the copies of the S, or,
as in the Proverbs of Aboo-'Obeyd, مِنْ طَالِبِ ضَأْنٍ
ثَمَانِينَ [than a demander of eighty sheep], (TA,)
is a saying that originated from the fact that an
Arab of the desert announced to Kisrà an event
that rejoiced him, whereupon he said, “Ask of
me what thou wilt; ” and he asked of him eighty
sheep. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  [It also signifies Eightieth.]

-b2-
[ثَامِنَ عَشَرَ and ثَامِنَةَ عَشْرَةَ, the former masc. and
the latter fem., meaning Eighteenth, are subject
to the same rules as ثَالِثَ عَشَرَ and its fem., explained in art. ثلث, q. v.] ―
-b3-  إِبِلٌ ثَوَامِنُ, [the
