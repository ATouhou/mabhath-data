-A2-  ثَأْرٌ also signifies,
(A,) or ↓ ثَائِرٌ, (T,) One who seeks blood-revenge,
or retaliation of the slaughter of his relation:
and one of whom is sought blood-revenge, or retaliation of the slaughter of a relation: (T, A:)
the latter primarily signifies a slayer; and hence,
a slayer of a person's relation in vengeance, or
retribution: (Ham p. 637:) and the former, one
who is sought, or pursued, for blood-revenge; an
inf. n. used as a subst.: (Ham p. 87:) the slayer

S, K.) يَا ثَأْرَاتِ عُثْمَانَ, occurring in a trad., which
is also related with the substitution of تَارَات for
ثأرات, may be explained in the same manner; or
it may mean O ye seekers of the blood-revenge of
'Othmán, aid me to obtain it; the prefixed noun
طَالِبِى, or أَهْل, being understood. (Nh, TA. [See
also تَارَةٌ in art. تور.]) ثَأْرٌ مُنِيمٌ [A slayer of one's

causes the pursuer of blood-revenge to cease from

an equivalent for the blood of one's relation [and
who therefore, by his being slain in retaliation,
makes the avenger to sleep]: (T:) or a person of
rank, or note, in whom [i. e. by the slaughter of
whom] one has his full desire accomplished. (A.)
In a trad. of Mohammad Ibn-Selemeh, relating
to the day of Kheyber, occur the words, أَنَا لَهُ يَا
↓ رَسُولُ اللّٰهِ المَوْتُورُ لِلثَّائِرِ, meaning [I am for him,
i. e. I am he who should slay him, O Apostle of
God:] the seeker of blood-revenge [is for him of
whom blood-revenge is sought]. (L. [The explanation there given is clearly shown to relate to
الموتور.]) ―
-b2-  ثَأْرٌ signifies also An enemy: pl. أَثْآرٌ:
so explained as occurring in the following words
of a trad.; لَا تُغْمِدُوا سُيُوفَكُمْ عَنْ أَحْدَاثِكُمْ فَتُوتِرُوا
أَثْآرَكُمْ Do not sheathe your swords from your
young ones, [neglecting to teach them the use
