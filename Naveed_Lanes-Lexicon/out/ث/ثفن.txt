the act of lying down,] of [the callosity upon the
breast called] the كِرْكِرَة and the سَعْدَانَة, [two

lower parts, of the thighs; of the camel: (M, K: *)
pl. ثِفَنٌ and ثِفَانٌ (M, K) and ثِفِنَاتٌ: (T, S, M:)
the ثَفِنَات of the camel are the parts that fall upon
the ground when the animal lies down, and that
become rough, or callous, such as the two knees,
&c.; (S;) the parts that are next the ground
when the camel lies down, one of them being the
كِرْكِرَة, with which they are five in number [as
explained above]: or, as some say, the ثَفِنَة is
[only the stifle-joint, i. e.,] the joint between the
thigh and the ساق [or leg properly so called],
internally, [meaning anteriorly,] and [the knee,
i. e.,] the joint between the shank and the arm:
(T:) or, accord. to some, any part that is next
the ground, of any quadruped, when he lies down
like the camel and like the sheep. (M.) ―

the K “ and,”] the place of union of the shank

fore part of the knee, which becomes callous in
consequence of much kneeling: see 3, first sentence. Hence,] 'Abd-Allah Ibn-Wahb Er-Rásibee
was surnamed ذُو الثَّفِنَاتِ (S, M, K *) from his much
praying, (M,) because long prostration produced
an [indurating] effect upon his ثفنات: (S, K:) and
'Alee Ibn-El-Hoseyn Ibn-'Alee, (K, TA,) known
by the appellation of Zeyn-el-'Ábìdeen, (TA,) was
[likewise] so surnamed, (K, TA,) because those
parts of him upon which he prostrated himself
were like the ثفنة of the camel in consequence of his
much praying: (TA:) so too was 'Alee Ibn-AbdAllah Ibn-El-'Abbás. (A, K.) ―
-b4-  الثَّفِنَةُ مِنَ الجُلَّةِ,

(AHn, M,) The two edges of the lower part of the
جُلَّة, (AHn, M, K,) [meaning,] of the dates [contained in the receptacle thus called; app. because

-A3-
And [as fem. of ثَفِنٌ, which is perhaps unused,]
