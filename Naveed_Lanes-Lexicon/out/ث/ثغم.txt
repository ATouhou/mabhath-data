having a green stem, (TA,) which becomes white
when it dries, (S, Msb, TA,) and to which hoariness is likened; (S, Msb; [Golius, app. misled
by a false reading in a copy of the S, says “ simile
anetho; ”]) it has a thick [head, or blossom, such
as is called] سَنَمَة, and [it is said that [it does not
grow save upon a black mountain-top, and is
found in Nejd and Tihámeh: (TA:) A 'Obeyd
says that it is a kind of plant, (TA,) IF, that it
is a tree, (Msb,) with a white blossom and fruit,
(Msb, TA,) to which hoariness is likened: (TA:)
it is called in Persian درمنه; (K; [written in
different copies of that work دِرَمْنَه and دَرَّمْنَه and
دَرَمْنَه; the last of which is said in the TA to be
the right reading; a word said to mean wormwood, and hyssop; or, accord. to Meninski, as
mentioned by Freytag, zedoary; but this last is
called in Persian زُرُنْبَا, with which word درمنه
may have been confounded;]) or درمنه اسبيد,
(S,) or دَرْمَنَه إِسْپِيد, in which [SM thinks] the
former word is a contraction of دَرْمِيَانَه; the two
together meaning “ in the middle white: ” (TA:)
the n. un. is with ة: (S, K:) and ↓ أَثْغَمَآءُ is a
quasi-pl. n.; (K;) as though the اء were a substitute for the ة of أَثْغِمَةٌ. (TA.)

L, a head wholly white. (TA.)
أَثْغِمَآءُ: see ثَغَامٌ.
