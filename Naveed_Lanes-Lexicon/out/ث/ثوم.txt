ثومثُومٌ [Garlic; the allium sativum of Linn.;] a
kind of بَقْل, (AHn, M,) well known, (S,) abundant in the country of the Arabs; (AHn, M;)
of two sorts; wild, (AHn, M, K,) and growing
in the cultivated tracts, (AHn, M,) or in gardens:
(K:) the former sort is called ثُومُ الحَيَّةِ, and is
the stronger, (K,) and is brought from Syria:
(TA:) each of them is heating, expels flatulence
and worms, and is strongly diuretic; and this is
the most excellent [property] that is therein: it
is good for obliviousness, and asthma, and chronic
cough, and [pain in] the spleen and the flank,
and colic, and sciatica, &c.: (K: [in which are
added many other supposed uses:]) n. un. with ة.
(AHn, M, K.) ―
-b2-  Hence, as being likened thereto,
(M,) ثُومَةٌ signifies also (tropical:) The pommel of a sword.
(S, M, K.) Whence, أُمُّ ثُوْمَةَ, said to be the name
of a certain woman, may mean (tropical:) A sword. (M.)
―
-b3-  [Hence, also,] ثُوْمَةُ ذَكَرِ رَجُلٍ (assumed tropical:)  [The glans of
a man's penis]. (Az, in TA voce طُرْثُوثٌ.) ―
-b4-
الثُّومَةُ also signifies The channel [or oblong depression] between the two mustaches, against the
partition between the two nostrils; (IAar, TA;)
i. q. الخُنْعُبَةُ, &c. (TA in art. خنعب.)
-A2-  ثُومٌ is
also a dial. var. of فُومٌ, meaning Wheat. (Lh,
T, M.) And the latter is used in the [ordinary]
sense of the former. (T.)
