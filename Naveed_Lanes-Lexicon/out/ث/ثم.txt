ثم1
ثَمَّهُ, (S, M, * K,) aor.
ثَمُ3َ, (S, M,) inf. n. ثَمٌّ,
(T, S, M,) He repaired it; or put it into a good,
sound, or right, state; (T, S, M, K;) [by filling
up its interstices, &c.,] with ثُمَام [q. v.]. (S.)
Hence the saying, ثَمَمْتُ أُمُورِى (assumed tropical:)  I put my
affairs into a good, sound, right, or proper,
state; restored them to such a state; or set them
right, or in order. (S.) And hence also the
saying, كُنَّا أَهْلَ ثَمِّهِ وَرَمِّهِ (assumed tropical:)  [We were the fit
persons to put it into a good, sound, right, or
proper, state; &c.]; (S;) occurring in a trad.;
accord. to the relaters thereof, وَرُمِّهِ ↓ ثُمِّهِ; but
A 'Obeyd holds the former reading to be the
right. (T.) ―
-b2-  He spread ثُمَام for it, namely, a
skin of milk, and put it [ثمام] above it, in order
that the sun might not strike it, and its milk
become consequently decomposed, or curdled. (T.)
―
-b3-  [He stuffed it, either with ثُمَام or absolutely:
for] ثُمَّ signifies it was stuffed. (T.) ―
-b4-  He collected it together; (S, M, K;) namely, a thing;
(S, M;) mostly used in relation to dry herbage.
(M, K.) You say, ثُمَّ لَهَا, i. e. Collect thou [for
them; namely, the cattle &c.; like ثِمْ لَهَا from
وَثَمَ]. (TA.) And هُوَ يَثُمُّهُ وَيَقُمُّهُ He sweeps it,
and collects the good and the bad. (S.) ―
-b5-  ثَمَّ الطَّعَامَ,
(M, K,) [aor. and] inf. n. as above, (M,) He ate
the good of the food and the bad thereof; (M,
K;) as also قَمَّهُ. (TA.) ―
-b6-  ثَمَّتْةُ, (T, * S, M, K,)
aor. and inf. n. as above, (M,) She (a ewe or a
goat, M, K, or, as some say, only the latter, M)
pulled it, or plucked it, up, or out, with her
mouth; (T, S, M, K;) namely, a thing, (T, M,)
or a plant, (S, K,) and anything by which she
passed. (TA.) ―
-b7-  ثَمَّ يَدَهُ بِالحَشِيشِ, (M, K,) or
بِالأَرْضِ, (S, M,) [aor. and] inf. n. as above, (TA,)
He wiped his hand (S, M, K) with the dry herbage, (M, K,) or upon the ground. (S, M.)
ثَمَّ There; syn. هُنَاكَ; (Zj, S, M, K;) a noun
of indication, (Zj, T, M, Msb, Mughnee, K,) denoting a place that is remote (Zj, T, S, M, Mughnee, K) from the speaker, (Zj, T, M,) like as هُنَا
denotes that which is near; (Zj, T, S;) or denoting
a place other than that of the speaker: (Msb:)
it is an adverbial noun, not to be used otherwise
than as such; (Mughnee, K;) indecl. because of
its vagueness, and with fet-h for its termination
to avoid the concurrence of two quiescent letters.
(Zj, T, M.) Thus in the saying [in the Kur
xxvi. 64], وَأَزْلَفْنَا ثَمَّ الآخَرِينَ [And we brought
near, there, the others]. (Mughnee.) He who
makes it decl. as an objective complement (Mughnee, K) in this ex., (Mughnee,) and in the saying
in the Kur [lxxvi. 20], وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَ ثَمَّ رَأَيْتَ نَعِيمًا,
is in error: (Mughnee, K: *) Zj says that the
meaning is, And when thou castest thine eyes, or
thy sight, there, thou shalt behold [scenes of]
enjoyment: that Fr asserted the meaning to be,
إِذَا رَأَيْتَ مَا ثَمَّ [when thou seest what is there];
but that this is an error; for ما, accord. to this
interpretation, is a conjunct noun, and it is not
allowable to suppress a conjunct noun and leave
its complement. (T.) ―
-b2-  [مِنْ ثَمَّ is used by postclassical writers as meaning Therefore; for that
reason; on that account.]
ثُمَّ, (T, S, M, &c.,) for which one also says فُمَّ,
(M, Mughnee,) substituting ف for the ث, (M,)
and ثُمَّتَ (T, S, M) and ثُمَّتْ, (M, TA,) but ثُمَّتَ
is the more common, (Mughnee and K on the
letter ت,) and فُمَّتَ and فُمَّتْ, (M, TA,) [meaning Then, i. e., afterward, or afterwards,] a
particle, (M, K,) or conjunction, (Zj, T, S, Msb,
Mughnee,) denoting order (Zj, T, S, M, Msb,
Mughnee) and a delay, (S, Msb,) or having three
properties, namely, that of virtually associating
in the same case [the latter of the two members
which it conjoins with the former of them], and
denoting order, and denoting a delay; but respecting all of these there is a difference of opinions.
(Mughnee, K. *) As to the associating in the
same case, Akh and the Koofees assert that it
sometimes fails to have this property, by its
occurring redundantly, so as not to be a conjunction at all; and they hold to accord with
this assertion the saying in the Kur [ix. 119],
حَتَّى إِذَا ضَاقَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الْأَرْضُ بِمَا رَحُبَتْ وَضَاقَتْ
عَلَيْهِمْ أَنْفُسُهُمْ وَظَنُّوا أَنْ لَا مَلْجَأَ مِنَ اللّٰهِ إِلَّا إِلَيْهِ ثُمَّ
تَابَ عَلَيْهِمْ [Until, when the earth became strait
to them, notwithstanding its amplitude, and their
minds became straitened to them, and they knew
that there was no repairing for refuge from God
save unto Him, then He returned to forgiveness
towards them]: (Mughnee, K: *) but this has
been resolved by the subaudition of the complement [of what precedes ثُمَّ, as though the meaning
were, then (they betook themselves unto Him,
begging forgiveness, and) He returned &c.].
(Mughnee.) And as to its denoting order, some
hold that there are exs. of its not necessarily
implying this; (Mughnee, K; *) one of which is
the saying in the Kur [xxxix. 8], خَلَقَكُمْ مِنْ نَفْسٍ
وَاحِدَةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا: (Mughnee: [in which
are added other similar exs., one of which is given
in the K:]) but to this there are five replies: 1st,
that this passage is elliptical; the meaning being,
He created you from one person (which He
originated); then He made therefrom its mate:
2nd, that the meaning is, He created you from a
person that was alone; then &c.: 3rd, that the
progeny of Adam were made to come forth from
his back like little ants; then Eve was created
from his [rib called the] قُصَيْرَى: 4th, that the
creation of Eve from Adam being unusual, ثمّ is
used to notify its order and posteriority in respect
of wonderfulness and of the manifestation of
power; not to denote order and posteriority of
time: 5th, that ثمّ is here used to denote the
order of enunciation; not the virtual order: the
replies preceding this last are better than it, inasmuch as they verify the order and the delay;
whereas the last verifies the order only, as there
is no delay between the two enunciations; but the
last reply is of more common application, applying
to the ex. given above and to others: (Mughnee:)
Fr says that the meaning of the ex. given above
is, He created you from a person (which He
created) single; then &c.; and in like manner
says Zj. (T.) And as to its denoting a delay,
Fr asserts that sometimes this is not the case, as
is shown by the saying, أَعْجَبَنِى مَا صَنَعْتَ اليَوْمَ
ثُمَّ مَا صَنَعْتَ أَمْسِ أَعْجَبُ [What thou didst to-day
excited my wonder, or admiration, or pleasure;
then (I tell thee) what thou didst yesterday was
more wonderful, or admirable, or pleasing]; for
ثمّ is here used to denote the order of the enunciation; not a delay between the two enunciations.
(Mughnee, K. *) ―
-b2-  [It is said that] it denotes
order and a delay when it conjoins single words:
but Akh says that it has the meaning of وَ [And],
because it is used in cases in which there is no
order; as in وَاللّٰهِ ثُمَّ وَاللّٰهِ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ [By God, and
(I say again,) By God, I will assuredly do such
a thing]: and when it conjoins propositions, it
does not necessarily denote order, but has the
meaning of وَ: (Msb:) it has the meaning of وَ,
(S, Msb,) the conjunction, (S,) in the saying in
the Kur [x. 47], ثُمَّ اللّٰهُ شَهِيدٌ عَلَى مَا يَفْعَلُونَ
[And God is witness of what they do]. (S,
Msb.) ―
-b3-  The Koofees allow its being used in the
manner of فَ and وَ so as that the aor. immediately
following it after a conditional verb may be man-
soob: and Ibn-Málik allows its being thus used
so as that the aor. immediately following it after
the expression of a desire that the thing shall not
be done may be marfooa and mejzoom and man-
soob. (Mughnee.)
ثُمٌّ: see ثُمَامٌ.
-A2-  In the saying مَا لَهُ ثُمٌّ وَلَا رُمُّ
[He has not ثُمّ nor رُمّ], the former of these two
nouns signifies water-skins, or milk-skins, and
vessels; (M;) or what is bad, or the worst, of
those things, (S, K,) accord. to ISk; (S;) or
men's household-goods, or furniture and utensils,
and their water-skins, or milk-skins, and vessels;
(T, TA;) which last is the right meaning: (TA:)
and the latter noun signifies مَرَمَّةُ البَيْتِ [app.
meaning, accord. to analogy, (for I find no suitable explanation of it in any of the lexicons,) the
means by which a house, or tent, is put into a
good state; and therefore, good furniture and
utensils]. (ISk, S, M, K.) You say also, مَا يَمْلِكُ
ثُمًّا وَلَا رُمًّا, meaning the same: (S, TA:) or he
possesses not little nor much: it is not used save
with a negation. (M, TA.) An Arab of the
desert said, جَعْجَعَ بِىَ الدَّهْرُ عَنْ ثُمِّهِ وَرُمِّهِ, [thus
in some copies of the S, and in the TA, in which
latter the last two nouns are expressly said to be
with damm, but in two copies of the S, in this
instance, erroneously written, ثَمِّهِ وَرَمِّهِ,] i. e.
[Fortune has debarred me] from its little and its
much. (S, TA.) And hence the saying of the
vulgar, جَآءَ بِالثُّمِّ وَالرُّمِّ, except that they pronounce both these nouns with kesr, meaning He
brought little and much. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also 1.
ثَمَّةٌ: see ثُمَامٌ.

dichotomum; called by Delile (Flor. Aeg., no. 58,

rushes (أُسَل), and brooms are made of it, and
water-bags are covered with it to protect them
from the sun, causing the water to become cool:
(TA:) [see also أُمْصُوخَةٌ:] it is also called ↓ ثَيْمُومٌ,
(K,) and ↓, [but see what follows,] (T, M,)
which is sometimes contracted into ثُمَةٌ; (T;) or
it is also called ↓ ثُمٌّ, of which ↓ ثُمَّةٌ is the n. un.:

(S, M, Msb, K.) You say of a thing that may be
reached, or taken with the hand, without difficulty,

K, *,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  It is easy to thee, or within thy reach,
no obstacle intervening between thee and it: (IAar,
M:) because the ثمام is not tall, (T, K,) so that
the reaching it should be difficult. (T.) And

thee], (M,) is a prov. used in relation to the
attainment of a thing that one wants. (M, TA.)
The Arabs also say, ↓ هُوَ أَبُوهُ عَلَى طَرَفِ الثُّمَّةِ,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  He is like his father: and some of
them say ↓ الثَّمَّة, with fet-h. (TA.) And it is
said in a trad. of 'Omar, اُغْزُوا وَالغَزْوُ حُلْوٌ خَضِرٌ
قَبْلَ أَنْ يَصِيرَ ثُمَامًا ثُمَّ رُمَامًا ثُمَّ حُطَامًا (assumed tropical:)  [Engage
ye in predatory warfare while it is sweet and
fresh], meaning, while ye see, and make abundant,
your spoils, before it become feeble like the ثمام;
[then, decayed; then, broken up.] (TA.) ―
-b2-  It
also signifies What has become dry, or dried up,
