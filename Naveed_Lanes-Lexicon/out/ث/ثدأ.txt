ثدأثُنْدُؤَةٌ and ثَنْدُؤَةٌ, (M,) or ثَنْدُوَةٌ, (Lth, T,) or
ثُنْدُوَةٌ, of the measure فُنْعُلَةٌ, with damm to the
ف and ع, or, accord. to some, the ن is radical
and the و augmentative, the measure being فُعْلُوَةٌ,
(Msb in art. ثدى,) or ثُنْدُؤَةٌ and ثَنْدُوَةٌ, (ISk,
T, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) with damm to the ث if with
ء, (ISk, T, S, Mgh, Msb,) and of the measure
فُعْلُلَةٌ, (ISk, S,) and with fet-h to the ث if with و,
without ء, (ISk, T, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and in this
case of the measure فَعْلُوَةٌ, (ISk, S, K,) like قَرْنُوَةٌ
and عَرْقُوَةٌ, (ISk, S,) [the ن in both cases, accord.
to ISk, being radical,] so in the Bári', (Msb,)
and so says Ktr, (TA,) but A'Obeyd says that
the Arabs in general pronounced the word without ء, (Msb,) The ثَدْى [which generally signifies the breast, or mamma, but sometimes the
pap, or mamilla,] of a man: (Mgh:) or the
part, of a man, that corresponds to the ثَدْى of a
woman: (T, S, Msb, K:) or the flesh of the
ثَدْى: (Lth, T, M, Mgh:) or the flesh that is
around the ثَدْى: (ISk, T, S, K:) or the base of
the ثَدْى: (As, Zj in his “ Khalk el-Insán,” S,
Msb, K, KL *:) or the portion of flesh that is
at the base thereof: (Msb:) or i. q. ثَدْىٌ: (TA:)
and the pap, or mamilla, of a woman and of a
man: (KL:) accord. to the author of the Wá'ee,
the pl. [of تندؤة] is ثَنَادِهُ, [with ه substituted for
ء, unless the former be a mistranscription for the
latter,] (TA,) and [that of ثندوة is] ثَنَادٍ. (Msb,
TA.) The word ثدى is used in relation to men
in the Saheeh of Muslim, and ثندؤة in relation
to women in the Sunan of Aboo-Dáwood; and
many of the lexicologists incline to the opinion
that ثدى is common to men and women. (MF
in art. ثند.) ―
-b2-  ثُنْدُؤَةُ الأَنْفِ, occurring in a trad.,
The tip, or fore part, of the nose. (IAth, TA.)
