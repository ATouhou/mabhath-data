ثرد1
ثَرَدَ, aor.
ثَرُدَ, (M, L,) or
ثَرِدَ, (so in one place
in the TT,) inf. n. ثَرْدٌ, (T, M, Mgh, L,) He broke
a dry or hollow thing: (T, Mgh, L:) he crumbled
a thing, or broke it into small pieces, with his
fingers. (M, L.) [Hence,] ثَرَدَ خُبْزًا, (S, M, A,
Msb, K,) aor.
ثَرُدَ, (Msb,) inf. n. as above, (S,
Msb,) He crumbled bread, or broke it into small
pieces, with his fingers, (M, A, Msb, K,) then
moistened it with broth, (A, Msb,) and then piled
it up in the middle of a bowl: (A:) or he broke
bread: (S:) and in like manner ↓ اِتَّرَدَهُ, originally
اِثْتَرَدَهُ; and ↓ اِثَّرَدَهُ: (S, K:) and ثَرِيدًا ↓ اثّرد, and
↓ اتّردهُ, he made, or prepared, ثريد [i. e. bread
crumbled &c. as above described]. (M.) ―
-b2-  He
rubbed and pressed a testicle with the hand, in
lieu of castrating; (K;) inf. n. as above. (Mgh.)

much but having life remaining in him. (IAar,
T, K.)
2
ثرّد, (T, M, K,) inf. n. تَثْرِيدٌ; (T, S, Mgh;)
and ↓ ثَرَدَ; (K;) [ISd says,] I think that the latter
is a dial. var. of the former; (M;) He killed an
animal that should be slaughtered without cutting
the أَوْدَاج [or external jugular veins] so as to make
the blood flow; (M, K;) i. e., (TA,) he killed it
with a blunt knife, so that he broke, [or tore, the
flesh &c.,] and did not cut so as to make the blood
flow: (A, TA:) or he killed it by squeezing and
pressing the اوداج, without cutting, and making
the blood to flow: (Mgh:) or he killed it with a
thing that did not make the blood to flow freely:
or he killed it without practising the method prescribed by the law: (T:) or تثريد in slaughtering
is the breaking [the bones or joints &c. of the
animal] before it is cold; and this is forbidden.

4
أَثْرَدَ [It seems that Golius found أَثْرَدَ erroneously
written in a copy of the S and in a copy of the K

8
اِثَّرَدَ and
اِتَّرَدَ: see 1, in four places.
ثَرْدٌ Weak rain. (IAar, M, K.)
ثَرَدٌ (S, K) and ↓ تَثْرِيدٌ (A) (tropical:)  A chapping in

ثُرْدَةٌ: see what next follows.
ثَرِيدٌ and ↓ مَثْرُودٌ Bread crumbled, or broken
into small pieces, with the fingers, and then moistened with broth: (Msb:) or [simply] broken bread.
(S.) ―
-b2-  Also, the former, (T, A,) and ↓ ثَرِيدَةٌ (T,
M, A, K) and ↓ ثُرْدَةٌ (S, M, A, Msb) and ↓ ثَرُودَةٌ
(M, K) and ↓ مَثْرُودَةٌ (K accord. to the TA) and
↓ أُثْرُدَانٌ, (Fr, M, * K,) Bread, itself, crumbled, or
broken into small pieces, with the fingers, (T, * S, *
M, A, Msb, K, *) then moistened with broth (T,
A, Msb) &c., (T,) and then piled up in the middle
of a bowl; (A;) generally having some flesh-meat
with it: (L:) or ↓ ثَرِيدَةٌ signifies a mess, or
portion, of ثَرِيد [or bread crumbled or broken
&c.]; (T;) [and so ↓ ثَرُودَةٌ, and ↓ مَثْرُودَةٌ:] that of
Ghassán is said by common consent to have been
prepared with marrow, and with eggs, or the
yolks of eggs; and there was no kind more delicious than these two kinds. (TA.) The pl. of
ثريدة is ثَرَائِدُ and ثُرُدٌ and ثُرْدٌ; (A, and Ham
p. 524;) the last of which is a contraction of that
next preceding it. (Ham ubi suprà.) A poet, as
cited by IAar, says,
↓ أَلَا يَا خُبْزُ يَا ابْنَةَ يَثْرُدَانٍ
أَبَى الحُلْقُومُ بَعْدَكِ لَا يَنَامُ
[Now surely, O bread, O daughter of two preparers of ثَرِيد, the throat refuses, after swallowing
thee, to rest, by reason of desire for more]: he
says that the poet calls the bread after two young
men, or slaves, who were preparing ثريد, and
gives tenween to يثردان by a poetic license,
instead of saying يَثْرُدَانِ, which, as it is [originally] a verbal phrase, he should have said by
rule: but the word, as Fr relates it, is ↓ أُثْرُدَانٍ;
and [ISd says,] I think that this is a determinate
subst., for الثَّرِيد or المَثْرُود, and therefore properly imperfectly decl., but here made perfectly
decl. by a poetic license. (M.) It is said in a
trad. that the excellence of 'Áïsheh above other
women is as the excellence of ثريد above other
kinds of food; but it is said that what is here
meant is food prepared with flesh-meat, together
with ثريد, because this is generally prepared with
flesh-meat, and it is said to be one of the two
things called لَحْم. (TA.)
