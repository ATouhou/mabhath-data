ثط1
ثَطَّ, aor.
ثَطَ3َ; (Lth, TA;) [app. accord. to him
who says رَجُلٌ أَثَطُّ; for Lth adds,] and, accord.
to him who says رَجُلٌ ثَطٌ, (Lth, TA,) ثَطَّ, aor.
ثَطِ3َ
and
ثَطُ3َ; (Lth, K;) inf. n. [of ثَطَّ of which the aor.
is
ثَطَ3َ,] ثَطَطٌ, (Lth, IDrd, S, K,) and [of the verb
of which the aor. is
ثَطِ3َ,] ثَطٌّ, and [of that of which
the aor. is
ثَطُ3َ, the second pers. of the pret. being
app. ثَطُطْتَ,] ثَطَاطَةٌ and ثُطُوطَةٌ; (Lth, K;) or
the last two, accord. to IDrd, are simple substs.,
and ISd approves of this distinction; (TA;) He
(a man, Lth, S) was, or became, such as is termed
ثَطٌّ and أَثَطُّ [explained below]. (Lth, IDrd, S, K.)
ثَطٌّ and ↓ أَثَطُّ, (Lth, S, K,) but the former is
the more correct and the more common, (Lth,)
or the former only, (IDrd, and IB on the authority of Ibn-El-Jawáleekee, and K,) the latter
being vulgar, (IDrd, K,) but AZ asserted his
having heard the latter, (AHát, cited in the Jm,)
[and the latter only is mentioned in the Mgh,] A
man (S, Mgh) having no hair upon the sides of
his face, but only upon his chin; syn. كَوْسَجٌ: (S,
Mgh, K:) or having a scanty beard: (IDrd:)
or the former signifies having little hair in the
beard, and in the eyebrows: (K:) or [when you
mean the latter] you say رَجُلٌ ثَطُّ الحَاجِبَيْنِ, (K,)
a man having thin, or scanty, eyebrows; as also
الحَاجِبَيْنِ ↓ أَثَطُّ; (TA;) the mention of the eyebrows being indispensable; (IAar, K;) and اِمْرَأَةٌ
ثَطَّةُ الحَاجِبَيْنِ [a woman having thin, or scanty,
eyebrows]: (S TA:) pl. (of pauc., TA) أَثْطَاطٌ
(Kr, K) and (of mult., TA) ثُطَّانٌ and ثِطَطَةٌ
(AZ, K) and ثُطُطٌ, (IAar,) [all of which may be
of either sing.,] and ثِطَاطٌ, (AZ, S, K,) which is
of the former sing., (S,) and ثُطٌّ, (AZ, S, K,)
which is of the latter. (S.) You say also اِمْرَأَةٌ
↓ ثَطَّآءُ A woman having no إِسْب, (Lth, TA,) i. e.
hair on the pubes; in the copies of the K incorrectly written اِسْت. (TA.) And ↓ عَارِضٌ أَثَطُّ A
side of the cheek, or of the face, having the hair
falling off. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  Also, the former, Heavy
in the belly; (K, TA;) slow; applied to a man.
(TA.)
-A2-  The former also signifies Human excrement or ordure; or thin human excrement or
ordure; syn. سَلْحٌ. (Sgh, K.) [See also ثَلْطٌ.]
أَثَطُّ, and its fem. ثَطَّآءُ: see ثَطٌّ, in four places.
―
-b2-  الثَّطَّآءُ also signifies The spider: or another
creeping thing, that stings, or bites, vehemently:
(K:) this is from Lth, as in the O and L: but
in the Tekmileh we find الثَّطَّآءُ, like شَفَّآء, [app. a
mistake for الثِّطَآءُ, like شِفَآء,] a certain small
creeping thing: or, as some say, it is الثَّطَا, of the
measure of قَفًا. (TA.)
