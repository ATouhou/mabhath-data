ثأب1
ثُئِبَ, ('Eyn, T, M, K,) like عُنِىBَ, (K,) and
ثَئِبَ, (IKoot, L, and so in a copy of the A,)
inf. n. ثَأْبٌ, (K,) or ثَأَبٌ, (M,) He became relaxed
and sluggish; said of a man: (A:) or he became
affected with sluggishness and languor; (M;) as
also ↓ تثآءب: (M, A:) or he became affected with
sluggishness and languor like the languor of drowsiness; as also ↓ تثآءب and ↓ تثأّب; (K;) which
last is approved by IDrd and Thábit Es-Sara-
kustee, who disallow ↓ تثآءب, though this is the
form commonly known and approved, and is the
most chaste form: (TA:) or he became affected
with languor like the heaviness of drowsiness, in
consequence of something that he had eaten or
drunk, without becoming insensible; (T;) as also
↓ تثآءب: (L:) or ↓ this last signifies he yawned, or
opened his mouth, (Mgh, Msb,) by reason, (Mgh,)
or on the occasion, (Msb,) of languor (Mgh,
Msb,) like the heaviness of drowsiness; (Mgh;)
or he yawned, or opened his mouth, and stretched
himself, on being affected by sluggishness or drowsiness or anxiety; (MF, TA, on the authority of
IDrst;) or he yawned, or opened his mouth, and
emitted wind from his stomach, by reason of some
affection thereof: (TA on the authority of EtTedmuree:) التَّثَاؤُبُ is from الثُّؤَبَآءُ; (AZ, T, S,
Mgh;) and is on the occasion of one's stretching
himself, and being languid: (Lth, T:) one should
not say تَثَاوَبَ; (AZ, T, S, O, Mgh;) [for] this is
vulgar. (Msb.) Hence, أَحَدُكُمْ فَلْيُغَطِّ ↓ إِذَا تَثَأَءَبَ
فَاهُ [When any one of you yawns, he should cover
his mouth with the back of his left hand; for it is
believed that the devil leaps into the uncovered
yawning mouth]. (Mgh.)

ثُؤَبَآءُ, (T, S, M, K, &c.,) as also ثُؤْبَآء, accord. to
Ibn-Mis-hal, but this is strange, (TA,) is a subst.
derived from التَّثَاؤُبُ, like مُطُوَآءُ from التَّمَطِّى;
(T;) or from ثَئِبَ; and means A state of relaxation and sluggishness: (A:) or sluggishness and
languor (M, K) like the languor of drowsiness:
(K:) or languor like the heaviness of drowsiness,
in consequence of something that one has eaten or
drunk, not attended by insensibility: (T, L:) or
a yawning, or opening the mouth, by reason of
languor like the heaviness of drowsiness: (Mgh:)
or a yawning, or opening the mouth, and stretching
oneself, on being affected by sluggishness or drowsiness or anxiety: (IDrst, MF, TA:) or a yawning, or opening the mouth, and emitting wind
from the stomach, by reason of some affection
thereof. (Et-Tedmuree, TA.) Hence the prov.,
أَعْدَى مِنَ الثُّؤَبَآءِ, (S, A, TA,) and [الثُّوَبَآءِ,] without ء, as some say; (MF;) or the pronunciation
without ء  is vulgar, (IDrst, TA,) or erroneous;
(TA;) [More catching than yawning;] for when
a man yawns ( اذا تثاءب ) in the presence of others,
they become affected as he is. (TA.)
مَثْؤُوبٌ Affected with sluggishness and languor
like the languor of drowsiness: from ثُئِبَ, q. v.
(K.)
