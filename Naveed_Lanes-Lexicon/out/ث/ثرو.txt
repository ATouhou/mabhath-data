Third Mansion of the Moon: it is believed to
be the most beneficial, in its influences on the
weather, of all the Mansions of the Moon, on
account of the period of its auroral setting, which,
in central Arabia, about the commencement of
the era of the Flight, began on the 12th of
Nov., O. S.: (see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل; and
see also نَوْءٌ:) hence what is said of it in Job
xxxviii. 31; and hence, as being the most excellent of all asterisms, it is called by the Arabs]
النَّجْمُ [the Asterism]: (S, K:) the former appellation is given to it because it comprises, in
appearance, many stars in a small space; (M,
K; *) for it is said that amid its conspicuous stars
are many obscure stars; (IAth, TA;) the number
altogether being said to be four and twenty,
agreeably with an assertion of the Prophet: some
say that it is so called because of the abundance
[of the rain] of its نَوٌء [here meaning auroral
setting]: (TA:) the word is thus applied only in
the dim. form, which is used in this instance to
denote magnification. (M, TA.) ―
