تَثْوِيبٌ meaning The calling, or summoning,
(M, Mgh, K,) to prayer, (M, K,) and to other
things, (M,) is said to be from ثَوْبٌ “ a garment,”
(Mgh,) because a man, when he comes crying
out for aid, makes a sign with his garment, (M,
Mgh,) moving it about, raising his hand with it,
in order that he to whom he calls may see it,
(Mgh,) and this action is like a calling, or summoning, (M, Mgh,) and an announcing, to him;
so the calling, or summoning, by reason to frequent usage of this word [as meaning the making
a sign with a garment], came to be thus called;
and one said of the caller, or summoner, ثوَب:
(Mgh:) or it means the calling, or summoning,
twice; (M, K;) or the repeating a call or summons; from ثاب “ he returned: ” (Mgh:) you
say, ثوّب, inf. n. as above, (T, Msb,) meaning
he called, or summoned, one time after another;
(T;) he repeated his call, or cry: (Msb:) and
hence تثويب in the أَذَان; (T, Msb;) i. e., the
saying of the مُؤَذِّن, after having, by the اذان,
called the people to prayer, الصَّلَاهْ رَحِمَكُمُ اللّٰهُ
الصَّلَاهْ [Prayer: may God have mercy on you!
Prayer!]; thus calling to it a second time: (T:)
or his saying, (S, TA,) in the morning call to
prayer, (S,) الصَّلَاةُ خَيْرٌ مِنَ النَّوْمٌ [Prayer is
better than sleep]; (S, TA;) for he resumes his
call by saying this after he has said, حَىَّ عَلَى
الصَّلَاهْ [and حَىَّ عَلَى الفَلَاحٌ]; desiring the people
to hasten to prayer: (TA:) or his saying, in the
morning call to prayer, الصلاة خيرمن النوم
twice, (T, K,) after having said, حَىّ علي الصلاه
حىّ علي الفلاح: (T:) or the old تثويب was
the saying of the مُؤَذِّن, in the morning call to
prayer, الصلاة خير من النوم: and the modern,
الصَّلَاهْ الصَّلَاهْ; or قَامَتْ قَامَتْ. (Mgh.) It also
signifies The إِقَامَة; (Mgh, K, TA;) [meaning, the chanting, by the مُبَلِّغُون, in a mosque,
not by the مُؤَذِّن, the common words of the أَذَان,
with the addition of قَدْ قَامَتِ الصَّلَاهْ (The time of
prayer has come), pronounced twice after حىّ
على الفلاح;] i. e. the اقامة of prayer: (IAth,
TA:) and this is what is meant by the phrase, in
a trad., إِذَا ثُوِّبَ بِالصَّلَاةِ [When the words of the
اقامة are chanted]. (IAth, Mgh, TA.) And The
praying after the prayer divinely ordained. (Yoo,
T, K.) You say, ثوّب, meaning He performed a
supererogatory prayer after the prescribed; تثويب
being only after the prescribed; being the praying after praying: (T:) and ↓ تثوّب signifies
the same. (K.) And ثّوب بِرَكْعَتَيْنِ He performed two rek'ahs as a supererogatory act.
(A.) But this and the similar significations are
said to be post-classical. (MF.) ―

[that the medial radical letter of this word is ى,
whereas many hold that letter to be و]; (Mgh;)
or ↓ تَثَيَّبَتْ; (K in art. ثيب; [the author of
which seems to have supposed that, for ثَيَّبَتْ, one
should read ثُيِّبَتْ; and therefore he gives مُثَيَّبٌ
as syn. with ثَيِّبٌ;]) She (a woman) became what
is termed ثَيِّب. (T, Mgh, K.) ―
-b2-  [Accord. to
my copy of the Mgh, it also signifies She (a
camel) became what is termed نَاب: but I think
that, in this instance, it is a mistranscription, for
نَيَّبَتْ.]

what is there said by SM, meanings assigned

inf. n. تَثْوِيبٌ, (K,) He gave him a substitute,
&c., for such a thing. (M, K. *) ―
-b4-  اثاب الثَّوْبَ,
inf. n. إِثَابَةٌ, He sewed the garment, or piece of

A.) And اِسْتَثَبْتُ بِمَالِكَ I restored to myself, or
repossessed myself of, property, by means of that
which thou gavest me; my property having gone
away. (A.) El-Kumeyt says,

of cloth or stuff,] that is worn by men, composed

Msb,) silk, or the like; (Msb;) but [properly]
not what is cut out of several pieces, such as the
shirt, and trousers, or drawers, &c.; (Mgh;)
[though often applied to a shirt or shift (قَمِيص or
دِرْع) and to a جُبَّة &c.:] it seems to be so called
because the wearer returns to it, or it to the
wearer, time after time: (Mgh:) [also a garment
worn by women and girls over the shift; (see
أُصْدَةٌ;) app., as in the present day, a long gown,
reaching to the feet, with very wide sleeves:] pl.
ثِيَابٌ [the pl. of mult.] (T, S, M, A, Mgh, Msb,
K) and أَثْوَابٌ [a pl. of pauc.] (S, M, Msb, K)
and أَثْوُبٌ and أَثْؤُبٌ, (S, M, K,) the last two being
pls. of pauc., and the latter of them being thus
pronounced with ء by some of the Arabs because
the dammeh immediately after و is deemed difficult of utterance; for which reason they substitute
ء for و in all instances like this. (S.) ―
-b2-  Curtains,
and the like, are not [properly] called ثِيَاب; but
أَمْتِعَةُ البَيْتِ: (Mgh, Msb:) though Es-Sarakhsee
uses the phrase ثِيَابُ البَيْتِ. (Mgh.) تَعَلَّقَ بِثِيَابِ
اللّٰهِ (tropical:)  [He clung to the curtains of the House of
God], i. e., to the curtains of the Kaabeh, is a
tropical expression. (A.) ―
-b3-  Sometimes, ثَوْبٌ is
used metonymically to signify (tropical:)  A thing [of any
kind] that veils, covers, or protects: as in the
saying of a poet,
كَثَوْبِ ابْنِ بِيضٍ وَقَاهُمْ بِهِ
فَسَدَّ عَلَى السَّالِكِينَ السَّبِيلَا
[Like the means of protection adopted by Ibn-Beed: he protected them by it, and closed the
way against the passengers]. (TA.) Ibn-Beed
was a wealthy merchant of the tribe of 'Ád, who
hamstrung his she-camel upon a mountain-road,
and stopped the way [to his abode] with it. (K
in art. بيض.) ―
-b4-  In the same manner, also, ثِيَابٌ
is used to signify (tropical:)  Weapons. (Ham p. 63.) ―
-b5-
And أَثْوَابٌ is sometimes employed to signify (assumed tropical:)  The
wearers of garments; the wearers' bodies. (R,
TA.) Esh-Shemmákh says, (T,) or Leylà, describing camels, (TA,)
وَمَوْهَا بِأَثْوَابٍ خِفَافٍ فَلَا تَرَى
لَهَا  شَبَهًا إِلَّا النَّعَامَ المُنَفَّرَا
i. e. They mounted them, namely, the travellingcamels, (T,) with their [light, or agile,] bodies:
[and thou seest not anything like them, except
ostriches scared away.] (T, TA.) And in like
manner, also, the dual is employed to signify
(assumed tropical:)  The wearer's body, or self; or what the garments infold: and ثِيَاب is employed in the same
manner. (TA.) You say, لِلّهِ ثَوْبَاهُ, i. e. (tropical:)  To God
be he [meaning his excellence] attributed! [for
nothing but what is excellent is to be attributed
to God:] (A:) or it means لِلّهِ دَرُّهُ [To God be
attributed the good that hath proceeded from
him! or his good deed! &c.: see arts. اله and در].
(K.) And فِى ثَوْبَىْ أَبِى أَنْ أَفِيَهُ meaning (tropical:)  [On
me and on my father it rests, or lies, or be it, that
I pay it: or] فِىذِمَّتِى وَذِمَّةِأَبِى [on my responsibility and the responsibility of my father]. (K,
TA.) And اُسْلُلْ ثِيَابَكَ مِنْ ثِيَابِى (tropical:)  Withdraw, or
separate, thyself from me. (A.) ―
-b6-  [The following
exs. are mostly, or all, tropical.] ―
-b7-  إِنِّ المَيِّتَ
لَيُبْعَثُ فِى ثِيَابِهِ الَّتِى يَمُوتُ فِيهَا, (K, * TA,) a
saying of Mohammad, repeated by Aboo-Sa'eed
El-Khudree, when, being about to die, he had
called for new garments, and put them on:
(TA:) it means Verily the dead will be raised in
his garments in which he dies; accord. to some;
and was used in this sense by Aboo-Sa'eed: (ElKhattábee, MF, TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  [agreeably with] his
works (K, TA) with which his life is closed:
(TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  in the state in which he dies, according as it is good or evil. (TA.) ―
-b8-  وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ,
in the Kur [lxxiv. 4], means And purify thy
garments: (Abu-l-'Abbás, T:) or shorten thy
garments; for the shortening them is a means of
purity: (T:) or (assumed tropical:)  put not on thy garments in a
state of disobedience or unrighteousness: (I'Ab,
T:) or (assumed tropical:)  be not perfidious; for [figuratively
speaking,] he who is so pollutes his garments:
(Fr, T:) or, as some say, (assumed tropical:)  purify thy heart:
(Abu-l-'Abbás, T, K:) or (assumed tropical:)  purify thyself (IKt,
T, TA) from sins, or offences: (IKt, TA:) or
(assumed tropical:)  rectify thine actions, or thy conduct. (TA.) ―
-b9-
You say, فُلَانْ نَقِىُّ الثَّوْبِ, meaning (tropical:)  Such a one
is free from vice, or fault: (A:) and طَاهِرُ الثَّوْبِ
(tropical:)  [the same; or pure in heart, or conduct, or
reputation]. (TA in art. نصح.) And دَنِسُ الثِّيَابِ
(tropical:)  Vicious, or faulty: (A:) or perfidious: (Fr,
T:) or foul, or evil, in reputation, (T, TA,) in
conduct, or actions, and in the way that he follows

See these two words.)
ثِيبٌ: see ثَائِبٌ, in two places.
ثُبَةٌ The place where the water collects in a
valley or low ground; so called because the water
returns to it: (Aboo-Kheyreh, T:) and the middle
of a watering-trough or tank, (T, S, M,) to which
the water returns when it has been emptied, (S,)
or to which what remains of the water returns;
(T;) as also ↓ مَثَابٌ: (S:) the ة is a substitute
for the و, the medial radical, which is suppressed;
(S, L;) the word being from ثَابَ, aor. يَثُوبُ:
(L:) Aboo-Is-hák infers that this is the case from
its having for its dim. ↓ ثُوَيْبَةٌ: but it may be
from ثَبَّيْتُ “ I collected together: ” (M:) it is
mentioned in the K in art. ثبى or ثبو, and not
here. (TA.) See also art. ثبو or ثبى. ―
-b2-  Also
A company of men; (T, M, L;) and so أُثْبِيَّةٌ:
(M:) or a company of men in a state of separation or dispersion; (T;) a distinct body, or company, of people: (Yoo, T:) and a troop of
horsemen: (M:) pl. ثُبَاتٌ and ثُبُونَ (T, M) and
ثِبُونَ: (S and M in art. ثبى, and M in art. ثبو
also:) accord. to some, from ثَابَ, being originally ثُوبَةٌ; and its dim. is ↓ ثُوَيْبَةٌ: accord. to
others, it is originally ثُبْيَةٌ; (T, L;) and its pl.
is ثُبًى. (L.) Hence, in the Kur [iv. 73], فَانْفِرُوا
ثُبَاتٍ, i. e. [And go ye forth to to war against the
unbelievers] in troops, (Fr, T,) or in distinct
bodies. (Yoo, T.) See, again, art. ثبو or ثبى.
ثُوَبَآءُ: see ثُؤَبَآءُ, in art. ثأب.
ثَوَابٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ مَثَابَةٌ (T,
Msb) and ↓ مَثُوبَةٌ (T, S, M, K) and ↓ مَثْوَبَةٌ, (EtTemeemee, T, M, K,) the last anomalous, (M,)
and unknown to the Kilábees, who knew the
second of these words, (T,) A recompense, compensation, requital, or reward, (T, S, M, Mgh,
Msb, K,) of obedience [to God]: (S:) or absolutely; for good and for evil; as appears from
the words of the Kur, هَلْ ثُوِّبَ الكُفَّارُ [cited above,
see 4]; but more especially and frequently, for
good. (IAth, L, MF, TA.) ―
-b2-  ثَوَابٌ is also used
as a quasi-inf. n., in the sense of إِثَابَةٌ; and in
this case, accord to the Koofees and Baghdádees,
it may govern as a verb, [like the inf. n.,] as in
the saying,
لِإَنَّ ثَوَابَ اللّهِ كُلَّ مُوَحِّدٍ
جِنَانٌ مِنَ الفِرْدَوْسِ فِيهَا يُخَلَّدُ
[For God's rewarding every believer in his unity
will be the giving gardens of Paradise, wherein
he will be made to abide for ever]. (Expos. of
the Shudhoor edh-Dhahab.) ―
-b3-  It signifies also
(tropical:)  Honey; (K, TA;) i. e. (TA) the good that
proceeds from bees. (A, TA.) ―
-b4-  And in like
manner, (tropical:)  [Rain; i. e.] the good that results

(Msb;) A woman who has become separated
from her husband (Lth, T, M, Mgh, K) in any
manner: (Lth, T, M, Mgh:) or a woman whose
husband has died, or who has been divorced, and
has then returned to the marriage-state: (AHeyth,
TA:) or one that is not a virgin: (IAth, TA:)
or a woman to whom a man has gone in; and a
man who has gone in to a woman: (Ks, ISk, S,
Mgh, K:) or a person who has married: (Msb:)
applied to a man and to a woman; (As, S, M,
Msb;) like بِكْرٌ and أَيِّمٌ: (Mgh, Msb:) from ثَابَ;
(IAth, Mgh, Msb;) because they generally return
time after time to the marriage-state: (Mgh:)
but mostly applied to a woman; because she
returns to her family in a manner different from
the first [state]; (Msb;) or because the suitors
return to her time after time: (Mgh:) or it is
not applied to a man (Lth, El-'Eyn, T, M, Mgh,
K) except in the dual form, as when one says
وَلَدُ الثَّيِّبَيْنِ: (Lth, El-'Eyn, T, M, K:) and a
woman is also termed ↓ مُثَيِّبٌ; (M;) or ↓ مُثَيَّبٌ,
like مُعَظَمٌ: (K: [but see 2, last sentence but
two:]) the pl. of ثَيِبٌ applied to a woman is
ثَيِّبَاتٌ, (T, Mgh, Msb,) and the post-classical
writers say ثُيَّبٌ, which has not been heard as
genuine Arabic: (Mgh, * Msb:) its pl. if applied
to a man is ثُيِّبُونَ. (Msb.) It is said in a trad.,
الثَّيِّبَانِ يُرْجَمَانِ وَالبِكْرَانِ يُجْلَدَانِ وَيُغَرَّبَانِ [The
two persons of whom each has previously had
carnal intercourse in marriage with one of the
other sex shall be stoned if they commit adultery
together; and the two who have previously had
no connubial intercourse with others shall be
flogged and banished if they commit fornication
together]. (T.) ―
-b2-  It is also applied to (assumed tropical:)  A woman
who has attained the age of puberty, though a
a virgin; tropically, and by extension of its
proper signification. (IAth, TA.) ―
-b3-  This word
is mentioned in the K [and M] in art. ثيب; and
its mention in art. ثوب is said by the author of
the K to be wrong: but IAth and many others
decisively assert that it is from ثَابَ, aor. يَثُوبُ,
“ he returned. ” (MF, TA.)
ثُوَيْبَةٌ: see ثُبَةٌ, in two places.
ثِيابَةٌ and ثُيُوبَةٌ, as meaning The state of being
a ثَيِّب, are not of the genuine language of the
Arabs. (Mgh.)
ثِيَابِىٌّ One who takes care of the clothes in the
bath. (K.) [A post-classical word.]
ثَوَّآبٌ i. q. تَوَّابٌ [One who repents, or returns
from disobedience to obedience to God, much or
often]. (T.)
-A2-  A seller of garments, or pieces of
cloth: (AZ, T, L, K:) and a possessor thereof.
(Sb, S, L, K.)
بِئْرٌ لَهَا ثَائِبٌ (tropical:)  A well into which water returns
after one has drawn from it; (A, TA;) see
مَثَابٌ; and in like manner, [but in an intensive
sense in the second of the following phrases,]
↓ بِئِرٌ لَهَا ثِيبٌ, and وَعِيبٍ ↓ ذِاتُ ثِيبٍ [in which
وعيب is an epithet]: (T, L, TA:) or the first
of these three phrases means a well of which the
water stops sometimes, and then returns. (Ham
p. 598.) You say of a well (بئر), مَا أَسْرَعَ ثَائِبَهَا
(assumed tropical:)  How quick is its returning supply of water!
(T.) ―
-b2-  ثَائِبُ البَحْرِ (assumed tropical:)  The water of the sea when

T) A place to which people return, (ISh, Aboo-Is-hák, T, S, Msb,) or to which one returns, (ISh,
S, Msb,) time after time; (S;) and ↓ مَثَابٌ signifies the same: (Aboo-Is-hák, T:) and the former,
a place of assembly or congregation: (ISh:) or a
place where people assemble, or congregate, after
they have separated, or dispersed; as also ↓ the
latter word: (M, K:) and a place of alighting or
abode; an abode; or a house; because the inhabitants thereof return to it (ISh, S) after having
gone to their affairs: (S:) the pl. is مَثَابَاتٌ; [also
mentioned above as pl. of مَثَابٌ;] (ISh;) or it is
↓ مَثَابٌ; (S;) [or this is a coll. gen. n.;] or,

stands in order that the bucket (دَلْو or غَرْب) may
not strike against the side of the well: (M:) or
the place where it is walled round within (مَوْضِعُ
طَيِّهَا): (K:) or, accord. to IAar, it means طَىُّ
البِئْرِ; but [ISd says,] I know not whether he
mean thereby مَوْضِعُ طَيِّهَا, or the building it [or
walling it round within] with stones; though it is
rarely that a word of the measure مَفَعَلَةٌ [like
