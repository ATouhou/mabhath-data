ثَمْدٌ: see what next follows.
ثَمَدٌ (T, S, M, A, K) and ↓ ثَمْدٌ (S, M, K) and
↓ ثِمَادٌ, (M, K,) or the last is a pl. of one of the
two preceding words, (MF,) Water that is little
in quantity, (Lth, T, S, M, K,) that has no continual increase: (S, M, A, K:) or a little water
remaining in a tract of hard, or hard and level,
ground: or what appears in winter and goes
away in summer (الصَّيْف): (M, K:) or a small
round hollow or cavity (قَلْت) in which the rainwater collects and from which men drink during
two months of the spring-season (الصَّيْف), but
which fails when the summer (القَيْظ) comes:
(IAar, T:) and rain-water that remains retained
beneath the sand, and, when this is removed, is
yielded by the ground: (A:) pl. ثِمَادٌ (T, A) and
أَثْمَادٌ [a pl. of pauc.]: (so in the L:) some say
that ثِمَادٌ signifies holes dug or excavated, in
which is a little water; and hence A'Obeyd says,
سُجِرَتِ الثِّمَادُ, meaning that the holes &c. were
filled by the rain; but he does not explain it:
(M:) or ثِمَادٌ signifies wells dug around a place
which has been prepared to receive the water of
the rain, where there is continually rain-water,
this place having water-courses, and the said wells
being filled therefrom: men drink the water that
lies open to view until it becomes dried up by
the effect of the hot winds of summer; the wells
remaining. (Aboo-Málik, T.)
ثِمَادٌ: see ثَمَدٌ.
ثَامِدٌ A lamb or kid or calf that has begun to
eat. (S.)
إِثْمِدٌ [An ore of antimony: or antimony itself;
stibium; or stimmi:] collyrium-stone (حَجَرُ
الكُحْلِ), (K, TA,) which is black inclining to red,
the mines whereof are in Ispahán, whence the
best is obtained, and in the West, whence the
hardest is obtained: (TA:) a certain stone used
as a collyrium: (S:) a certain stone from which
collyrium (كُحْل) is prepared: or collyrium
(كُحْل) itself: (M:) or a substance resembling
it: (Seer, M:) or a species thereof: (Lth, T:) or
black كُحْل, the mine whereof is in the East:
said by some of the lawyers to be that of Ispahán:
and said to be an arabicized word. (Msb.) The
women of the Arabs used also to sprinkle [or
rub] it upon the lips and gums, in order that
the teeth might glisten the more. (EM p. 62.)
[And for the same purpose, many of them tattoo
their lips, so as to make them of a uniform
dull bluish hue.] ―
-b2-  One says of a man who
remains awake at night, journeying or working,
فُلَانٌ يَجْعَلُ اللَّيْلَ إِثْمِدًا [Such a one makes the
night a collyrium]; the blackness of the night
being as though it were a collyrium to his eyes
because he labours all the night in seeking the
means of attaining to eminence. (AA, T, L.)
