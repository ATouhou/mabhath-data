ثيلثَيْلٌ: see what next follows.
ثِيلٌ The sheath of the penis of a camel (Lth, *
AZ, T, S, M, K) &c.; (K;) [i. e.,] of a he-goat
also, and of a bull: (M:) or the penis itself:
(Lth, T, M, K:) sometimes also used in relation
to a man: (M:) and ↓ ثَيْلٌ signifies the same;
(K;) mentioned by Ibn-'Abbád; and IAth adds
ثُولٌ. (TA.) Hence the prov., أَخْلَفُ مِنْ ثِيلِ
الجَمَلِ [More contrary to what is usual than the
sheath of the penis, or than the penis, of the
camel]: for the camel, like the lion, is a retromingent. (TA.)
-A2-  A kind of plant; (S, K;)
as also ↓ ثَيِّلٌ: (K:) a certain plant having a
root and stem; when short, called نَجْمٌ: and a
certain herb, or, as some say, a plant, that is
found on the banks, or sides, of rivers, in meadows: and, some say, a species of the [plants, or
trees, called] جَنْبَة, which grows in the territory
of [the tribe of] Temeem, and becomes large, so
that the sheep, or goats, lie in its shelter: (M:)
AHn says, (M,) in the “ Book of Plants,”
(Mgh,) the ثِيل, (M,) or ↓ ثَيِّل, (Mgh,) [both
appellations now applied to triticum repens, or
dog's grass,] is the نَجْمَة; called in Persian
ريزوپادله [?]; (Mgh;) its leaves are like those of
wheat, but shorter, and it spreads upon the face
of the ground, extending far, and becoming com-
plicated, or tangled, so as to be like felt (M,
Mgh) upon the ground; (M;) it has many
joints, or knots, and short internodal portions;
and scarcely, or never, grows anywhere but over
water, or in a place beneath which is water; (M,
Mgh;) and it is one of the plants that are regarded as indicative of the existence of water:
n. un. with ة: (M:) Lth says that the ثِيل is a
certain plant that tangles upon the ground: Th,
on the authority of IAar, says that it is a kind of
plant said to be that called لِحْيَةُ التَّيْسِ: and Sh
says that the ثِيلَة is a green small tree [or plant]
resembling the first shoots that come forth from
grain. (T.)
ثَيِّلٌ: see ثِيلٌ, in two places.
أَثْيَلُ A camel large in the ثِيل; (T, S, M, K;)
wide therein: (M:) pl. ثِيلٌ. (K.)
مَثِيلَة A place in which is the kind of plant
called ثِيل. (Mgh.)
