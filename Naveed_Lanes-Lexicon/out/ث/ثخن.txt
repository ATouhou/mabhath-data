ثُخْنٌ an inf. n. of ثَخُنَ: [commonly used as
a simple subst., meaning Thickness, &c.:] one
says ثُوْبٌ لَهُ ثُخْنٌ [A garment, or piece of cloth,

ثَخَنٌ i. q. نقلة [app. a mistranscription for
ثَقْلَةٌ or ثَقَلَةٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  A heaviness in the chest
or body, or a heaviness and langour, or a heaviness on the heart]; as also ↓ ثَخَنَةٌ: El-'Ajjáj
says,
حَتَّى يَعِجَّ ثَخَنًا مَنْ عَجْعَجَا
[app. meaning So that he who cries out cries out
by reason of heaviness, &c.]: (TA: [this saying is
also cited in the S, in art. عج; but there, in one
copy, I find ثَخِنًا; and in another, ثِخَنًا; and
in both, مِنْ instead of مَنْ:]) and hence he
received the surname of العَجَّاج: (S and TA in
art. عج:) so says IDrd. (TA in that art.)
[Golius explains ثَخَنٌ as meaning “ crassities,
spissitudo; ” on the anthority of Ibn-Maaroof
and Ibn-Beytár; but I suspect that he found
ثَخَنٌ in their works written for ثُخْنٌ or ثِخَنٌ,
both inf. ns. of ثَخُنَ.]
