عكف1
عَكَفَ عَلَيْهِ, aor.
عَكُفَ and
عَكِفَ, [the former, only,
mentioned in the Mgh, and only the latter in the
CK,] inf. n. عُكُوفٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and عَكْفٌ,
(Msb, TA,) or the latter is of the trans. verb, (T,
TA,) He kept, or clave, to it constantly, or perseveringly; (S, Mgh, * O, Msb, K, TA;) namely,
a thing; (S, O, Msb;) not turning his face from
it: or, as some say, he continued intent upon it:
(TA:) and, accord. to Er-Rázee, عَلَيْهِ ↓ اعتكف
would be agreeable with analogy, in the sense of
عَكَفَ عليه, but has not been heard. (Har p. 682.)
Hence, in the Kur [vii. 134], يَعْكُفُونَ عَلَى أَصْنَامٍ
لَهُمْ, (S, * O, TA,) or يَعْكِفُونَ, accord. to different readers, (O, TA,) i. e. A people keeping, or
cleaving, constantly, or perseveringly, to the
worship of idols belonging to them; (Ksh;)
or continuing intent upon the worship of idols
belonging to them. (Bd, Jel.) ―
-b2-  And عُكُوفٌ
[or عُكُوفٌ فِى مَكَانٍ] signifies The keeping, or
cleaving, to a place. (TA.) See also 8. ―
-b3-  And
one says, عَكَفَتِ الخَيْلُ بِقَائِدِهَا meaning أَقْبَلَتْ عَلَيْهِ
[i. e. The horses, or horsemen, (for the latter may
be meant notwithstanding the fem. pronoun,
agreeably with an ex. in De Sacy's Gram., sec.
ed., ii. 265,) advanced, or approached, towards
their leader; or kept, or clave, to him]. (TA.)
―
-b4-  And عَكَفُوا حَوْلَهُ They went round it; (S, O,
K;) namely, a thing. (S, O.) El-'Ajjáj says,
*عَكْفَ النَّبِيطِ يَلْعَبُونَ الفَنْزَجَا
[Like the going round of the Nabathæans playing
the game called فَنْزضج: in which عَكْفَ is probably
used by poetic license for عُكُوفَ]. (S, O.) And
in like manner one says, عَكَفَتِ الطَّيْرُ عَلَى القَتِيلِ,
(O,) or حَوْلَ القَتِيلِ, (K,) [The birds went round
the slain person], inf. n. عُكُوفٌ. (TA.) And
عَكَفَ الجَوْهَرُ فِى النَّظْمِ (S, O, K) i. e. [The gems]
went round [among the strung beads]. (O, K.)
―
-b5-  And عَكَفَ signifies also تَأَخَّرَ [He went back
or backwards, &c.; or became, or remained, behind; &c.]. (O, K.)
-A2-  عَكَفَهُ, aor.
عَكُفَ and
عَكِفَ, [the
former, only, mentioned in the Mgh, and only
the latter in the CK,] inf. n. عَكْفٌ, (S, O, Msb,
K,) He, or it, made him, or it, still, or motionless: (S, O:) and he, or it, detained, withheld,
or debarred, him, or it; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;)
as also ↓ عكّفهُ, (O, * TA,) inf. n. تَعْكِيفٌ; (TA;)
and so عَكَفَ بِهِ. (Har p. 293.) One says, عَكَفْتُهُ
عَنْ حَاجَتِهِ, (Msb,) aor. and inf. n. as above,
(TA,) I withheld him from the object of his want:
(Msb:) or I turned him away, or back, therefrom. (TA.) And مَا عَكَفَكَ عَنْ كَذَا [What has
withheld thee, or turned thee away or back, from
such a thing?]. (S, O.) ―
-b2-  See also 2. ―
-b3-  عَكَفَ,
(O, K,) inf. n. عَكْفٌ, (O,) also signifies رَعَى [app.
as trans., meaning He tended, or pastured, cattle;
&c.]. (O, K.) ―
-b4-  And i. q. أَصْلَحَ [He put into
a good, sound, right, or proper, state; &c.].

And عُكِّفَ النَّظْمُ, inf. n. تَعْكِيفٌ, The strung beads
had gems disposed in regular order (نُضِّدَ, Lth, O,
or نُظِمَ, K) among them. (Lth, O, K.) ―
-b4-  And
عُكِّفَ الشَّعَرُ The hair was crisped, curled, or
twisted, and contracted. (O, K.) And عكّفت
شَعَرَهَا She (a woman) made her hair to cleave
together, one part to another, and disposed it in
plaits; as also ↓ عَكَفَتْهُ; (Ham p. 267;) but, accord. to Lth, they seldom said عَكَفَ in relation to
hair that is termed مَعْكُوف, i. e. “ combed and
plaited,” though, if this were said, it would be
correct. (O.)
3
عاكف, accord. to Reiske, as mentioned by
Freytag, (app. followed by an accus.,) signifies
He clave continually to the side of any one.]

days and nights, or at least during one whole day,
fasting from daybreak to sunset, and occupying
himself in prayer and religious meditation, without
any interruption by affairs distracting the mind
from devotion and not pressing,] not going forth
therefrom except for human necessity: (TA:)
اِعْتِكَافٌ is thus termed because it is the withholding oneself from the customary exercises of freedom
of action in the disposal, or management, of affairs. (Msb.)
عَكِفٌ Crisp, curly, or twisted, and contracted,
hair. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.)

thing]: and remaining, staying, dwelling, or
abiding, in a place: (O:) pl. عَاكِفُونَ and عُكُوفٌ
