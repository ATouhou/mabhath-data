عدو1
عَدَاهُ, (Mgh, K,) first pers. عَدَوْتُهُ, (Msb,)
aor. يَعْدُو, (Mgh, Msb,) [inf. n. عَدْوٌ,] He passed
from it, (Mgh, Msb, K,) namely, a thing, or an
affair, (K,) to another, (Mgh, Msb,) and left
it; (K;) and عَدَا عَنْهُ signifies the same; (K;)
as also ↓ تعدّاه; (S, * K;) and in like manner
one says, ↓ عَدَّيْتُهُ, inf. n. تَعْدِيَةٌ; (Msb;) [but I
do not find this elsewhere, and think that correctly one should say, عَنْهُ ↓ عَدَّيْتُ; agreeably
with what here follows:] the saying عَنْ هٰذَا ↓ عَدِّ
means Leave thou this, and turn from it to
another; and is app. from the phrase هَمَّكَ ↓ عَدِّ
إِلَى غَيْرِهِ [Turn thy anxiety to other than him,
or it]; the objective complement being altogether
left out, so that the verb becomes as though it
were intrans.; and there are many instances
similar to this in the language: (Har p. 478:)
one says, عَنِّى الهَمَّ ↓ عَدَّيْتُ I turned away from
me anxiety: and [hence] you say to him who
has pursued you, عَنِّى إِلَى غَيْرِى ↓ عَدِّ, meaning
Turn thou the beast upon which thou art riding
towards other than me: (TA:) and عَمَّا تَرَى ↓ عَدِّ,
meaning Turn thou thine eye from what thou
seest. (S.) [See an ex. of the first of these verbs
in the Ham p. 125.] One says also, عَدَاهُ الأَمْرُ
and ↓ تعدّاهُ The thing, or affair, passed from
him. (TA. [See an ex. in the first paragraph
of art. عدم.]) And the Arabs say, إِنَّ الجَرَبَ
لَيَعْدُو, meaning Verily the mange, or scab, passes
from him that has it to him that is near to him
so that the latter becomes mangy, or scabby.
(Msb.) And مَا عَدَا فُلَانٌ أَنْ صَنَعَ [app. meaning
Such a one did not leave, or, accord. to an explanation of the verb in a similar phrase in Har
p. 333, did not delay, his doing such a thing].
(S.) Accord. to Er-Rághib, العَدْوُ primarily
signifies Transition; [whence what here precedes;] or the going, or passing, beyond, or the
exceeding, a limit, or the usual limit: and incompatibility to coalesce. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And [hence,]
عَدَاهُ, aor. as above, [inf. n. عَدْوٌ,] He went, or
passed, beyond it; exceeded it; or transgressed
it. (S, TA. *) So in the saying عَدَا طَوْرَهُ [He
went, or passed, beyond his proper limit; exceeded
it; or transgressed it]: and in like manner,
الحَقَّ ↓ تعدّى and ↓ اعتداهُ signify He went, or
passed, beyond, &c., what was true, or right;
and so عَنِ الحَقِّ, and فَوْقَ الحَقِّ. (TA.) أَمَا
عَدَا مَنْ بَدَا, a saying in which the vulgar erroneously omit the interrogative أ, means Does not
he transgress that which is right who begins by
acting injuriously? (TA.) And it is said عَدَا
القَارِصُ فَحَرَزَ (tropical:)  What was biting to the tongue
attained to an excessive degree, so that it became
acid: meaning that the affair, or case, became
distressing. (S in art. قرص.) ―
-b3-  And عَدَا عَلَيْهِ,
inf. n. عَدْوٌ and عَدَآءٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and عُدُوٌّ
(S, Msb, K) and عُدْوَانٌ (ISd, Msb, K) and
عِدْوَانٌ (ISd, K) and عُدْوَى; (K;) and ↓ تعدّى,
and ↓ اعتدى; (S, Msb, K;) He acted wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or tyrannically, against
him; (S, Msb, K;) and transgressed against
him, or exceeded the proper limit against him:
(S, Msb:) [and he acted aggressively against
him; agreeably with an explanation of the inf. n.
of the last of these verbs in what follows: (see
an ex. in a verse cited voce رِيحٌ:)] or he acted
with excessive wrongfulness, &c., against him:
(Mgh:) and ↓ اعدى signifies the same as
the other verbs here mentioned; (K, TA;)
whence (TA) one says, فِى مَنْطِقِكَ ↓ أَعْدَيْتَ
Thou hast deviated from that which is right in
thy speech: (S, TA:) ↓ الاِعْتِدَآءُ is the exceeding
what is right; and it is sometimes in the way of
aggression; and sometimes in the way of requital;
and instances of the usage of its verb in both of
these manners occur in the Kur ii. 190: (Er-Rághib, TA:) the first and third of the inf. ns.
of عَدَا, mentioned above, occur in the Kur vi.
108 accord. to different readings: (S, TA:) and
[it is said that] العُدْوَانُ signifies sheer, or unmixed, wrongful or unjust or injurious or tyrannical conduct: (S:) or, as some say, the worst of
[such conduct, i. e., of] الاِعْتِدَآء, in strength, or
deed, or state or condition. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And عَدَا
عَلَيْهِ He acted corruptly towards him. (TA.) ―
-b5-
And عُدِىَ عَلَيْهِ He had his property stolen, and
was wronged. (TA.) And عَدَا عَلَى القُمَاشِ,
inf. n. عَدَآءٌ [said in the TA to be like سَحَابٌ,
but in the CK عَدًا,] and عُدْوَانٌ and عَدَوَانٌ, (K,
TA,) but in the M written with damm and fet-h
[i. e. عُدْوَان and عَدْوَان], (TA,) said of a thief,
He stole the قماش [meaning goods, or utensils
and furniture]. (K, TA.) And عَدَا فِى ظَهْرِهِ
He stole what was behind him: (A in art. ظهر:)
[or he acted wrongfully in respect of what was
behind him: for] لِصٌّ عَادِى ظَهْرٍ is expl. by the
words عَدَا فِى ظَهْرٍ فَسَرَقَهُ [so that it app. means
A thief who has acted wrongfully in respect of
what was behind one, and stolen it]. (O and K
in that art.) ―
-b6-  And عَدَا عَلَيْهِ, (K, TA,) inf. n.
عَدْوٌ, (TA,) signifies also He leaped upon him,
or it. (K, TA.) ―
-b7-  And عَدَا, (K,) or عَدَا فِى
مَشْيِهِ, (Msb,) aor. يَعْدُو, (Msb, K,) inf. n. عَدْوٌ
(S, Mgh, Msb, K) and عَدًا and عُدُوٌّ and عَدَوَانٌ
and تَعْدَآءٌ, (K,) signifies أَحْضَرَ [i. e. He ran; or
rose in his running]; (S, * K, TA;) said of a man
and of a horse: (TA:) or he went a pace nearly
the same as that termed هَرْوَلَةٌ, (Msb, TA,) not so
quick, (TA,) or which is not so quick, (Msb,) as
that termed جَرْىٌ: (Msb, TA:) or he went a
pace less quick than شَدٌّ and more so than مَشْىٌ:
(TA in art. سعى:) or [he went quickly, or
swiftly; for] العَدْوُ signifies السُّرْعَةُ: (Mgh:) [or
rather he ran, whether gently or moderately or
vehemently: that it often signifies he ran vehemently is shown by the prov. مِنْ سُلَيْكٍ ↓ أَعْدَى
More vehement in running than Suleyk, who is
said to have outstripped fleet horses; and by
numerous exs.:] and ↓ عّى signifies the same
as عَدَا, denoting a quick pace. (TA in art.
هبص.) ―
-b8-  And [hence, perhaps,] عَدَا المَآءُ, aor.
يَعْدُو, (assumed tropical:)  The water ran. (TA.)
-A2-  عَدَاهُ عَنِ الأَمْرِ,
(S, K,) inf. n. عَدْوٌ and عُدْوَانٌ; as also ↓ عدّاهُ;
(K;) signifies He, or it, diverted him; or turned
him away, or back; (S, K;) and occupied him so
as to divert him; (K;) from the thing, or affair.
(S, K.) You say, عَدَتْ عَوَادٍ. (S, TA. See
عَادِيَةٌ, voce عُدَوَآءُ: and see also the last sentence
of the first paragraph of art. عود.) ―
-b2-  عَدَانِى مِنْهُ
شَرٌّ means بَلَغَنِى [i. e., app., Evil, or mischief,
reached me from him, or it]. (TA. [See a signi-
fication of 4.])
-A3-  عَدِيتُ لَهُ signifies I hated him,
or it. (ISd, K.)
-A4-  عَدَا is also a verb by which
one makes an exception, with مَا [preceding
it] and without مَا: (S, K:) you say, جَآءَنِى
القَوْمُ مَا عَدَا زَيْدًا [The people, or party, came to
me, except Zeyd]; and جَاؤُونِى عَدَا زَيْدًا [which
means the like]; putting what follows it in the
accus. case; the agent being implied in it: (S:
[see this expl. in what has been said of خَلَا as
used in the same manner:]) accord. to MF, it
is a verb when what follows it is put in the
accus. case; and when what follows it is put in
the gen. case, it is a particle, by common
consent: (TA: [and the like is said in the
Mughnee; i. e., that it is similar to خَلَا in respect
of the explanations there given of the different
usages of this latter; but that Sb did not know it
to have been used otherwise than as having the
quality of a verb:]) one says, رَأَيْتُهُمْ عَدَا أَخَاكَ
and مَا عَدَاهُ, meaning مَا خَلَا [i. e. I saw them,
except thy brother]: and sometimes it governs
the gen. case without ما: thus in the M: Az
says, [as though regarding it as only a particle,]
when you suppress [ما], you make it to govern
the accus. case as meaning إِلَّا and you make it
to govern the gen. case as meaning سِوَى.
(TA.

عداهٌ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَعْدِيَةٌ, (K,) He made
him, or it, to pass [from a thing, or an affair, to
another: see 1, first sentence]: (S, K:) and he
made it to pass through, and go beyond; syn.
أَنْفَذَهُ. (K.) ―
-b2-  Hence تَعْدِيَةُ الفِعْلِ, a phrase of
the grammarians, [generally meaning (assumed tropical:)  The making the verb transitive,] as in خَرَجَ زَيْدٌ فَأَخْرَجْتُهُ
[Zeyd went forth and I made him to go forth].

phrases next following]. ―
-b2-  عادى الشَّىْءَ signifies
He was, or became, distant, or aloof, from the
thing; or he made the thing to be, or become,
distant, or aloof; syn. بَاعَدَهُ. (TA.) And you
say, فُلَانٌ لَا يُعَادِينِى وَلَا يُوَادِينِى, meaning لَا
يُجَافِينِى وَلَا يُوَاتِينِى [app. Such a one will not
make me to be, or become, remote, or aloof, from
him, nor will he comply with me: but لَا يُوَادِينِى
properly signifies he will not take from me the
دِيَة, or bloodwit]. (TA.) And عَادِ رِجْلَكَ عَنِ
الأَرْضِ Draw away thy leg, or foot, from the
ground. (TA.) And عَادَى الأَدَاةَ عَنِ البَعِيرِ He
raised [partially] the furniture (consisting of the
saddle and saddle-cloth) from contact with the
camel [so as to render it bearable by him]. (ISh,

of the chase, (S, K,) by throwing down one of

[describing a horse,]
فَعَادَى عِدَآءً بَيْنَ ثَوْرٍ وَنَعْجَةٍ
دِرَاكًا وَلَمْ يَنْضَحْ بِمَآءٍ فَيُغْسَلِ
[And he made a succession, of one to the other,
between a wild bull and a wild cow, by running
down one after the other in a single heat, overtaking uninterruptedly, and not breaking out with
water (i. e. sweat) so as to become suffused therewith]. (S. [See EM p. 49.]) In like manner
also المُعَادَاةُ بَيْنَ رَجُلَيْنِ means The piercing, or
thrusting, two men, one after the other, uninterruptedly. (TA.) ―
-b7-  And عَادَيْتُهُ [sometimes]
signifies I vied, or contended, with him in running;

اعدى الأَمْرَ He passed from, or beyond,
another, to the thing, or affair: so in the K.
(TA.) But in the M it is said, اعداهُ الدَّآءُ signifies The disease passed from another to him.
(TA.) And one says أَعْدَى فُلَانٌ فُلَانًا مِنْ خُلُقِهِ,
or مِنْ عِلَّةٍ بِهِ, or جَرَبٍ, (S, TA,) i. e. Such a one
made somewhat of his natural disposition, or of a
disease, or malady, that was in him, or of mange,
or scab, to pass [from him] to such a one; [or infected him therewith; (see two exs., in a verse
and a hemistich, cited in the first paragraph of
art. جنى;)] and اعداهُ بِهِ signifies the same: and
اعدى صَاحِبَهُ He made his companion to acquire
the like of what was in him. (TA.) And يُعْدِى
is said of the mange, or scab, &c., meaning It
passes from him that has it to another; (S, K;)
and in like manner one says of a disease,
↓ يتعدّى: (Nh, TA:) but it is said in an explanation of a trad., لَا يُعْدِى شَىْءٌ شَيْئًا [i. e. A thing
(meaning disease) does not pass by its own agency
to a thing]. (S, TA.) [Therefore] one says, of
the mange, or scab, [or the like,] اعداهُ اللّٰهُ God
made it to pass from him that had it to one that
was near to him, so that he became affected therewith. (Msb.) ―

[app. أُمُورٌ عِدْوَةٌ, or perhaps أُمُورُ عِدْوَةٍ,] signifies
Remote affairs. (TA.)
عَدْوَى Mange, or scab, or other disease, that
passes, or is transitive, from one to another; (S,
K, TA;) a transitive disease; and such is said
to be the جَرَب, and the بَرَص, and the رَمَد, and
the حَصْبَة, and the جُذَام, and the وَبَآء, and the
جُدَرِىّ. (Kull p. 259.) You say, لَا تُقَرِّبْهُ مِنْهُ
فَإِنَّ بِهِ عَدْوَى Do not thou bring him near to
him, for in him is a disease such as the mange,
or scab, that is transitive from one to another.
(TK.) ―
-b2-  And The transition of the mange, or scab,
or other disease, from him that has it to another:
(S, K, TA, TK:) the subst. from يَعْدُو said of
the mange, or scab, expl. above, as meaning “ it
passes ” &c. (Msb. [See 1, first quarter.]) It
is said in a trad., لَا عَدْوَى, i. e. لَا يُعْدِى شَىْءٌ
شَيْئًا [A thing (meaning disease) does not pass by
its own agency to a thing]; (S;) or [lit.] there
is no transition of the mange, or scab, or other
disease, from him that has it to another. (TK.)
―
-b3-  And i. q. فَسَادٌ [i. e. Badness, corruptness, unsoundness, &c.]. (K, TA. [In the CK erroneously written in this sense عُدْوٰى; which, however, being an inf. n. of عَدَا in the phrase عَدَا
عَلَيْهِ, q. v., may be correctly used as having the
same, or nearly the same, meaning.]) So in the
saying, ?? [In him, or it, is badness, &c.].
(TK.)
-A2-  A(??) A demand that one makes upon a
prefect, or governor, [or judge,] to aid, or assist,
him against him who has wronged him, i. e. to
inflict penal retribution on him, (IF, S, Msb,)
for his wrongdoing to him. (IF, Msb.) ―
-b2-  And
Aid, or assistance, against a wrongdoer, (S, Mgh,
TA,) required of a judge, for the bringing into
his presence the antagonist: and also applied to a
signet, or a [sealed] piece of clay, given by the
judge as a token to denote the summoning of him
whose presence is required. (Mgh.)
عُدَوَآءُ (S, K) and ↓ عَادِيَةٌ and ↓ عَدَآءٌ (K)
Distance, or remoteness, (S, K, TA,) as also
↓ عِدًى, (Ham p. 377,) [or particularly] of a
house, or an abode, or a dwelling. (S, TA.)
[Hence,] one says, طَالَتْ عُدَوَاؤُهُمْ Their distance,
or remoteness, one from another, and their separation, was, or became, long. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also
(i. e. the first and ↓ second and ↓ third words)
Occupation, or business, that turns one away, or
back, from a thing: (K, TA:) or عُدَوَآءُ signifies
a custom, or habit, of occupation or business:
(TA:) and عُدَوَآءُ الشُّغْلِ, the hindrances, or impediments, of occupation or business: (S, TA:) and
one says, جِئْتَنِى وَأَنَا فِى عُدَوَآءَ عَنْكَ i. e. [Thou
camest to me when I was engaged] in an occupation that diverted [me from thee]: (so in one of
my copies of the S:) the pl. of ↓ عَادِيَةٌ is عَوَادٍ:
(TA:) عَوَادِى الدَّهْرِ means the accidents, or casualties, of time or fortune, that divert [or intervene
as obstacles] by occupying or busying: (S:) and
you say, عَوَادِ ↓ عَدَتْ, [lit.] meaning Things, or
events, turning away, or back, turned, or have
turned, away, or back; [but this phrase, when
followed by دُونَ or بَيْنَ, I would rather render,
simply, obstacles occurred, or have occurred;] (S,
TA;) thus in the latter of two verses cited voce
حَبَّ. (S.) ―
-b3-  عُدَوَآءُ الدَّهْرِ means The shifting,
and varying, of time or fortune. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And
عُدَوَآءُ الشَّوْقِ What has severely affected, distressed,
or afflicted, its sufferer, of the yearning, or longing, of the soul, or of longing desire. (TA.) ―
-b5-
And عُدَوَآءُ signifies also A مَرْكَب [i. e. beast, or
saddle, or thing on which one rides,] that is not
easy: (K:) or, accord. to As, a place where he
who sits thereon is not in a state of ease: and one
says, جِئْتُ عَلَى مَرْكَبٍ ذِى عُدَوَآءَ i. e. [I came
upon a beast, or saddle, &c.,] that was not easy:
(S:) and جِئْتُكَ عَلَى فَرَسٍ ذِى عُدَوَآءَ, the last
word imperfectly decl., i. e. [I came to thee upon
a horse] that was not easy: (TA:) and جَلَسَ
عَلَى عُدَوَآءَ He sat upon an uneven thing or place;
(M, TA;) the last word imperfectly decl., as is
said by ISd. (TA.) ―
-b6-  Also Dry, hard, land;
(K, TA;) sometimes occurring in a well when it
is dug; and sometimes it is stone, from which the
digger turns aside: and one says, أَرْضٌ ذَاتُ
عُدَوَآءَ, meaning land that is not even, or plain;
not easy to walk or ride or lie upon: or, as some
say, it means a rough, rugged, place: or an elevated place upon which the camel lies down and
then reclines thereon upon his side, having by his
side a depressed place, which causes him to tend
downwards, in consequence whereof he becomes in
the state termed تَوَهُّنٌ, [weak, or languid, and
unable to rise,] i. e. in the condition of extending
his body towards the low place while his legs are
upon the عُدَوَآء, which is the elevated, so that he is
unable to rise, and dies. (TA.)
-A2-  And [it is
said that] العُدَوَآءُ also signifies اناخة قليلة [app.
إِنَاخَةٌ قَلِيلَةٌ, meaning A little, or brief, making of
a camel to lie down upon the breast, as is done on
the occasions of mounting and dismounting &c.].
(TA.)
عُدْوِىٌّ and عُدَوِىٌّ [are rel. ns. of which only
the fem. forms are mentioned, in what here
follows]. عُدْوِيَّةٌ and عُدَوِيَّةٌ are rel. ns. of عُدْوَةٌ
as meaning “ the kind of plants, or herbage,
termed خُلَّة,” the former reg. and the latter
irreg.; and عَوَادٍ [pl. of ↓ عَادٍ or of عَادِيَةٌ] is a
possessive epithet [from the same], without the
relative ى: [all are app. applied to camels, as
meaning Having for their pasture the plants, or
herbage, called عُدْوَة, above mentioned: but it is
immediately added,] and عُدْوِيَّةٌ and عُدَوِيَّةٌ applied to camels signify that pasture upon the
[plants called] حَمْض: (TA:) and ↓ عَادِيَةٌ and
[the pl.] عَوَادٍ, so applied, have this latter meaning accord. to the M and K: but accord. to the
S, they are applied to camels as meaning abiding
among the [trees called] عِضَاه, not quitting them,
and not pasturing upon the حَمْض; and so is [the
pl.] عَادِيَاتٌ. (TA in another portion of this art.)
[See also عَاذِيَةٌ, in art. عذو.]
عِدَوِىٌّ, being a rel. n. of عِدَةٌ, see in art. وعد.
عَدَوِيَّةٌ The herbage of the صَيْف [q. v., here
app. meaning spring], after the departure of the
رَبِيع [q. v., here app. meaning winter]: (S, K:)
it is applied to the young trees which then become
green and are depastured by the camels: (S:) or,
as some say, the [plants, or herbage, called] رَبْل
[q. v.]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And The young ones of sheep
or goats. (K.) ―
-b3-  And Female infants [of the
age] of forty days; (K, TA; [in the CK, نَبات
is erroneously put for بَنَات;]) but when their
[hair termed] عَقِيقَة has been cut off, this appel-lation is no longer applied to them: so says Lth;
but Az pronounces him to have erred: (TA:) or
it is with غ (K, TA) and ذ, both dotted, or only
the former of them dotted, and one of them is
called غَدِىٌّ [or غَدَوِىٌّ, or غَذِىٌّ or غَذَوِىٌّ]:
thus in the M, and thus accord. to Az. (TA.)
عُدْوَانٌ [expl. in the S as signifying Sheer or
unmixed, wrongful or unjust or injurious or tyrannical conduct,] is an inf. n. of عَدَا in the phrase
عَدَا عَلَيْهِ [q. v.]; (ISd, Msb, K;) as also عِدْوَانٌ.
(ISd, K.)
عَدَوَانٌ, applied to a wolf, (S, K,) means يَعْدُو
عَلَى النَّاسِ [i. e. That acts aggressively against
men]; (S, TA;) i. q. ↓ عَادٍ [app. in this sense],
(K, TA,) which occurs in a trad. applied to a
beast of prey, (TA,) an epithet applied to a beast
of prey by the Prophet: (Mgh:) one says سَبُعٌ
عَادٍ and سِبَاعٌ عَادِيَةٌ. (Msb.) [In the S, immediately after the words يَعْدُو عَلَى النَّاسِ, it is added,
and hence their saying, السُّلْطَانُ ذُو عَدَوَانٍ وَذُو
بَدَوَانٍ; and thus I find the saying cited as from
the S in arts. عدو and بدو of the PS: but I
think that عَدَوَانٍ and بَدَوَانٍ, here, are mistranscriptions for عَدَوَاتٍ and بَدَوَاتٍ, as I find them
written in my copies of the S and TA in the arts.
above mentioned: see عَدْوَةٌ, above; and see
بَدَآءٌ in art. بدو, where it seems to be clearly
shown that بَدَوَاتٍ is correct, as pl. of بَدَاةٌ.] ―
-b2-
Also, (S, K, and Ham p. 81,) and ↓ عَدَّآءٌ, (Mgh,
Msb, K, and Ham ubi suprà,) That runs vehemently, or much; (S, Mgh, Msb, K; *) i. q.
شَدِيدُ العَدْوِ, (S, TA,) or كَثِيرُ العَدْوِ; (Ham;)
applied to a horse: (Mgh, and Ham:) [and to a
man:] الشَّدِيدَةُ, in the K, is a mistake for
الشَّدِيدُهُ, meaning الشَّدِيدُ العَدْوِ. (TA.)
عَدَآءٌ an inf. n. of عَدَا in the phrase عَدَا عَلَيْهِ
[q. v.]. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  And, as also
↓ عِدَآءٌ, A single طَلَق [or heat; i. e., a single run,
at once, to a goal, or limit]; (K, TA;) of a
horse. (TA.)
-A2-  And عَدَآءُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ, (S, K,) as
also ↓ عِدَاهُ, (K, TA,) [the latter written in the
CK عِداؤُهُ, but] the former is with the lengthened
ا and the latter with the shortened ا, (TA,) and
↓ عِدْوُهُ and ↓ عِدْوَتُهُ and ↓ عُدْوَتُهُ, (K,) signify
طَوَارُهُ, (S, K,) i. e. [The equal, of anything, in
breadth and length; or] what is coextensive with
anything in its breadth and its length. (S, TA.)
One says, لَزِمْتُ عَدَآءَ الطَّرِيقِ, or النَّهْرِ, or الجَبَلِ,
meaning طَوَارَهُ [i. e. I kept to the tract coextensive in its breadth and its length with the road, or
the river, or the mountain]. (TA.)
-A3-  See also
عُدَوَآءُ, first and third sentences.
-A4-  And see
عِدًى, and عِدْوَةٌ.
عِدَآءٌ: see the next preceding paragraph:
-A2-
and see also عِدًى.
عَدُوٌّ And enemy, contr. of وَلِىٌّ, (S,) or of صَدِيقٌ,
(K,) or of صَدِيقٌ مُوَالٍ; (Msb;) an epithet, but
resembling a subst.: (S:) [and (like our word
“ enemy ” in military parlance) a hostile party:
for] it is used alike as sing. and pl. and masc.
and fem.; (Msb, K;) as is said in the “ Muk-
tasar el-' Eyn: ” (Msb:) but sometimes it is
dualized and pluralized and feminized: (K:)
the pl. is أَعْدَآءٌ; (S, Msb, K;) and the pl. of
أَعْدَآءٌ is أَعَادٍ; (Msb, K; *) and عِدًى and عُدًى
are also pls. of عَدُوٌّ; (S, Msb, K; [each improperly termed in the K اِسْمُ جَمْعٍ; for فِعَلٌ and
فُعَلٌ are measures of pls., not of quasi-pl. ns.;])
the former said by ISk to be the only pl. of this
measure among epithets; (S, Msb; *) and عُدَاةٌ,
with damm and with ة, is another pl.; (Th, S,
Msb;) and is pl. of ↓ عَادٍ, (K, TA,) which is
syn. with عَدُوٌّ; (S, K, TA;) as in the saying of
a woman of the Arabs, أَشْمَتَ رَبُّ العَالَمِينَ عَادِيَكَ
[May the Lord of the beings of the universe make
thy enemy to rejoice at thy affliction]: (S, TA:)
the fem. form of عَدُوٌّ is عَدُوَّةٌ, (S, Msb,) which is
said by Az to be used when the meaning of an
epithet is intended: (Msb:) it is said by ISk,
(S, TA,) and in the “ Bari',” (Msb,) that there
is no instance of the measure فَعُولٌ in the sense
of فَاعِلٌ but its fem. is without ة, except عَدُوَّةٌ,
(S, Msb, K,) in the phrase هٰذِهِ عَدُوَّةٌ اللّٰهِ [This
woman is the enemy of God]: accord. to Fr,
عَدُوَّةٌ has the affix ة to assimilate it to صَدِيقَةٌ;
for a word is sometimes formed to accord with
its contr.: (S, TA:) AZ says that he heard
certain of the tribe of 'Okeyl say, [of some
women,] هُنَّ وَلِيَّاتُ اللّٰهِ and عَدُوَّاتُ اللّٰهِ and أًوْلِيَاؤُهُ
and أَعْدَاؤُهُ [i. e. They are the friends of God and
the enemies of God]. (Msb.) [The pl.] عِدًى
signifies also Persons distant, or remote, one from
another: (ISd, K, TA:) and (K) strangers, or
foreigners: (ISk, S, K, TA:) and such as are
distant, or remote, in respect of relationship; or
not relations: (TA:) as well as enemies: (M,
TA:) كَالأَعْدَآءِ, which is added in the K after
وَالغُرَبَآءُ, should be وَالأَعْدَآءُ. (TA.)
عَدِىٌّ is a pl. [or rather a quasi-pl. n.] of عَادٍ,
q. v. (S, TA.)
عَدَاوَةٌ Enmity, or hostility; (S, K, TA;) like
مُعَادَاةٌ [inf. n. of 3, q. v.]. (TA.)
عَدَّآءٌ: see عَدَوَانٌ, last sentence.
عَادٍ [act. part. n. of عَدَا, q. v. ―
-b2-  As such particularly signifying] Acting wrongfully, unjustly,
injuriously, or tyrannically; transgressing, or exceeding the proper limit: (Msb, TA:) pl. عَادُونَ.
(Msb.) Hence the saying, لَا أَشْمَتَ اللّٰهُ بِكَ عَادِيَكَ
i. e. [May God not make to rejoice at thy affliction] him who acts wrongfully to thee. (TA.)
[And hence the phrase لِصٌّ عَادِى ظَهْرٍ, expl. in
art. ظهر.] See also عَدَوَانٌ. And see عَدُوٌّ, with
which it is syn. ―
-b3-  Also Seizing, or carrying off,
by force; or snatching at unawares. (TA.) And
العَادِى signifies [particularly] The lion; (K,
TA;) because of his injuriousness, and his seizing
men and making them his prey. (TA.) ―
-b4-  ↓ عَدِىٌّ
is a pl. of عَادٍ, [or rather a quasi-pl. n.,] like as
غَزِىٌّ is of غَازٍ; as such signifying Runners upon
their feet: (S, TA:) or a company of men, (K,
TA,) in the dial. of Hudheyl, (TA,) that run to
the fight (K, TA) and the like: (TA:) or the
first, of the footmen, [or foot-soldiers,] that charge,
or assault; (K, TA;) because they run quickly:
(TA:) like عَادِيَةٌ, (K, TA,) of which the pl. is
عَوَادٍ, (TA,) in both senses: or this signifies the
horsemen; (K, TA;) i. e. the first, of the horsemen, that charge, or assault, in a hostile, or predatory, incursion, especially; (TA;) or horses
making a hostile, or predatory, incursion; and
hence [the pl.] العَادِيَات in the Kur c. 1. (TA in
the supplement to this art.) And accord. to ElKhuwárezmee, عَدِىٌّ particularly signifies The
foot-messengers of the sovereign, and of the judge,
who are made to run in quest of one against whom
an accusation has been made, and to bring him,
for the purpose of exacting from him the right,
or due, of his accuser. (De Sacy's Chrest. Arabe,
sec. ed., iii. 100.)
-A2-  عَادِى العَوَادِى, a phrase
used by a poet, is expl. by IAar as meaning The
hardest, or most pressing, or most severe, of occupations that turn one away, or back, from a thing.
(TA.)
-A3-  See also عَادٍ and its fem. عَادِيَةٌ voce
عُدْوِىٌّ.
-A4-  عَادِيَا اللَّوْحِ signifies طَرَفَاهُ [The two
extremities, or two sides, of the tablet or the like];
(K, TA;) each of them being called عادى [i. e.
عَادِى اللَّوْحِ, or a mistranscription for عَادٍ], like
عِدى [i. e. ↓ عِدًى or ↓ عَدًى, both mentioned
above, voce عُدْوَةٌ, as meaning, absolutely, a side,
or lateral part or portion]. (TA.)
عَادِيَةٌ [fem. of.عَادٍ, q. v.
-A2-  As a subst., it signifies] Wrongdoing, injustice, injuriousness, or
tyranny; and evil, or mischief; (S, TA;) as in
the saying دَفَعْتُ عَنْكَ عَادِيَةَ فُلَانٍ [I repelled, or
have repelled, from thee the wrongdoing &c., and
the evil, or mischief, of such a one]: (S:) it is an
inf. n. [or rather a quasi-inf. n.] like عَاقِبَةٌ: and
signifies also sharpness, or hastiness, of temper;
and anger. (TA.) Also The harm, or hurt, of
poison. (Har p. 304.)
-A3-  See also عُدَوَآءُ, in three
places.
-A4-  عَوَادِى الكَرْمِ, (K, TA,) of which عَادِيَةٌ
is the sing., (TA,) signifies The grape-vines that
are planted at the feet, or roots, of great trees.
(K, TA.)
أَعْدَى [a noun denoting the comparative and
superlative degrees, and having several different
significations]. أَعْدَى مِنَ الجَرَبِ More transitive, or wont to pass from one to another, than
the mange, or scab, is a prov. (Meyd.) And
أَعْدَى مِنَ الثُّؤَبَآءِ is another prov., having a similar
meaning [i. e. More wont to pass from one to
another, or, as we commonly say, more catching,
than yawning]; (Meyd;) for when a man yawns
in the presence of others, they become affected as
he is. (TA in art. ثأب.) ―
-b2-  أَعْدَى مِنَ الذِّئْبِ is
also a prov., and may mean More wrongful, or
more inimical, or more vehement in running, than
the wolf. (Meyd.) أَعْدَى مِنْ سُلَيْكٍ, another
prov., (expl. in the latter half of the first paragraph,) is from العَدْوُ. (Meyd.) ―
-b3-  هُوَ أَعْدَى شَىْءٍ
[app. meaning It is the most effectual thing to
aid, or assist, or to avenge; أَعْدَى in this case
being irregularly formed from the augmented
verb in the phrase أَعْدَاهُ عَلَيْهِ]. (TA in art. ادو:
see آدَى in that art.)
تَعَادٍ Uneven places, (K, TA,) dissimilar in
their several parts: occurring in this sense in a
trad. (TA.) As mentions the saying نِمْتُ عَلَى
↓ مَكَانٍ مُتَعَادٍ, meaning [I slept upon] a place
dissimilar in its several parts; uneven: and هٰذِهِ
↓ أَرْضٌ مُتَعَادِيَةٌ This is land having in it burrows,
and [trenches, or channels, such as are termed]
لَخَاقِيق. (S, TA.)
مَا لِى عَنْ فُلَانٍ مَعْدًى means There is not for
me any going beyond such a one to another, nor
any stopping short of him. (S.)
مَعْدُوٌّ: see what next follows.
فُلَانٌ مَعْدِىٌّ عَلَيْهِ and ↓ مَعْدُوٌّ (S, K *) mean
[Such a one is] treated wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or tyrannically: (K:) the ى in مَعْدِىٌّ
is substituted for و because the latter [in this
case] is deemed difficult of utterance. (S.)
