عَصًا i. q. عُودٌ [as meaning A staff, or stick, or
rod]: (K:) originally عَصَوٌ, and accordingly its
dual is as below: said to be thus called because
the fingers and hand are put together upon it [to
grasp it], from the saying عَصَوْتُ القَوْمَ “ I collected together the people, or party; ” as related
by As from some one or more of the Basrees:
(TA:) of the fem. gender: (S, Msb, K:) it is
said in a prov., ↓ العَصَا مِنَ العُصَيَّةِ [lit. The staff
is from the little staff; the dim. having the affix
ة because it is the dim. of a fem. n.]; (S;) [or]
العَصَا in this prov. is the name of a mare of
Jedheemeh [mentioned voce ضُلٌّ], and العُصَيَّة is
that of her dam; meaning that part of the thing,
or affair, is from part; (S, K, TA;) and said
when one is likened to his father; or meaning
that the big thing is in its commencement small:
(TA: [see also Freytag's Arab. Prov. i. 17:]) it
is not allowable to say عَصَآء; nor to affix ة: (As,
TA:) one says, هٰذِهِ عَصَاىَ أَتَوَكَّأُ عَلَيْهَا [This is
my staff; I support, or stay, myself upon it]:
Fr says that the first incorrect speech heard in
El-'Irák was the saying, هٰذِهِ عَصَاتِى: (S:) the
dual is عَصَوَانِ: (S, Msb:) and the pl. [of mult.]
is عُصِىٌّ, (S, Msb, K,) [originally عُصُووٌ,] of the
measure فُعُولٌ, (S, Msb,) and عِصِىٌّ, (S, K,) in
which the ع is with kesr because of the kesrah
following it, and [of pauc.] أَعْصٍ (S, Msb, K)
and أَعْصَآءٌ, (K,) or this last is agreeable with
analogy, but has not been transmitted, (ISk,
Msb,) and is disallowed by Sb, who says that
عُصِىٌّ CCC was used in its stead. (TA.) ―
