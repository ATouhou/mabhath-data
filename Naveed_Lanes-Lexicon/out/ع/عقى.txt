عقى1
عَقَى الأَمْرَ, aor. يَعْقِى: see 1 in art. عقو.
-A2-
عَقَى, aor. as above, inf. n. عَقْىٌ, said of an infant,
(S, K,) He voided his عِقْى; (K;) [i. e.] he voided
his ordure for the first time, and, after that, while
he was a youngling. (S.) It is said in a trad. of
I'Ab, that when a child once suckled by a woman
voids his عِقْى, she and her children become, to
him, within the prohibited degrees of marriage,
because it is known thereby that the milk has
entered his belly. (TA.)
-A3-  مَا أَدْرِى مِنْ أَيْنَ
عُقِيتَ and ↓ اعْتُقِيتَ mean I know not whence
thou camest, or hast come. (K, * TA.)
2
عقّى He (a bird) rose high in his flight. (S,
K.) ―
-b2-  And عَقَّتِ الدَّلْوُ The bucket rose in the
well turning round. (TA in art. عقو.) [See
also 1, (last sentence,) in art. عق.] ―
-b3-  And عقّى
بِسَهْمِهِ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَعْقِيَةٌ, (K,) He shot his
arrow [up] into the air; (S, K;) a dial. var. of
عَقَّهُ [or rather of عَقَّ بِهِ]. (S.) The Hudhalee,
(S,) El-Mutanakhkhil, (TA,) or Aboo-Dhu-eyb,
(L in art. وضح,) says,
عَقَّوْا بِسَهْمٍ فَلمْ يَشْعُرْ بِهِ أَحَدٌ
ثُمَّ اسْتَفَاؤُوا وَقَالُوا حَبَّذَا الوَضَحُ
[They shot an arrow towards the sky, and no one
knew of it: then they returned, and said, An
excellent thing is milk]; (S, TA;) meaning, “we
would rather have milk than the blood of him
who killed our companion; ” preferring that camels
should be given them as a compensation: (L in
art. وضح:) it is related [thus] with fet-h to the
doubled ق, so that its place is here; and also
with damm thereto, so that its place is art. عق,
in which it has been mentioned. (TA. [See a
similar verse cited voce عَقَّ, and the explanation
thereof, there preceding that verse.])
-A2-  And عقّاهُ,
inf. n. as above, He gave him to drink [or to
swallow] what would cause his عِقْى [q. v.] to pass
forth, (K, TA,) or honey in order that it might
have that effect. (TA.)
4
اعقى It was, or became, bitter, (K,) or
intensely bitter. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  And اعقاهُ He removed it from his mouth because of its bitterness:
(S, K:) like as one says أَشْكَيْتُهُ meaning “ I removed him from that of which he complained,”
(S, TA,) [or “ I removed from him that of which
he complained,”] the hemzeh having a privative
effect. (TA.) It is said in a prov., لَا تَكُنْ حُلْوًا
فَتُسْتَرَطَ وَلَا مُرًّا فَتُعْقَى, (S, TA,) or فَتُعْقِىَ, accord.
to different relaters. (TA. [See 1 in art. سرط,
where both these readings are expl., and where
the reading فَتُسْرَطَ is given instead of فَتُسْتَرَطَ.])

إِعْتَقَىَ see 1, last sentence.
عِقْىٌ What comes forth from the belly of the
child (S, Msb, K) before he eats, (S,) or when he
is born, (Msb, K,) black and viscous as though it
were glue; (Msb;) and likewise from the mare's
foal, and the young ass, and the young camel, and
the kid; (ISd, TA;) or what comes forth from
the lamb or kid, and the mare's foal, is called
رَدَجٌ: (S, TA:) and Az states that it is said to
be what comes forth from the belly of the fœtus,
inclosed in the [membrane called] حُوَلَآء [q. v.]; a
thing [or substance] that comes forth from its anus
while it is in the belly of its mother, part of it
black and part of it yellow: (TA:) pl. أَعْقَآءٌ.
(Az, K, TA.) أَحْرَصُ مِنْ كَلْبٍ عَلَى عِقْىِ صَبِىٍّ
is a prov. [meaning More eager than a dog for
the feces of a young child]. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also A
youngling, or young infant: whence the saying
of Z, ↓ فُلَانٌ لَهُ عِقْيَانِ وَلَيْسَ عِنْدَهُ العِقْيَانُ i. e. Such
a one has two younglings, or young infants, but
gold is not in his possession. (TA.)
عِقْيَانٌ Gold: (KL:) or pure gold: (S, TA:)
or gold that grows, [meaning native gold,] (S, K,
TA,) not such as is produced from the stones, (S,
TA,) or, as in the M and A, not such as is educed,
by melting, from the stones: the ا and ن are augmentative. (TA.) See an ex. in the latter sentence of the next preceding paragraph.
أَعْقَى [More, and most, intensely, or nauseously,
bitter]. (AHn, TA voce شَيْلَمٌ.)
مُعَقٍّ Circling over a thing, aloft, like the eagle.
(K, TA: mentioned in the former in art. عقو.)
