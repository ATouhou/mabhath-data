عبأ1
عَبَأَ, aor.
عَبَاَ, inf. n. عَبْءٌ, He packed up
goods, or utensils; put them one upon another:
(TA:) you say, عَبَأْتُ الشَّىْءَ فِى الوِعَآءِ [I packed
the thing in the repository], aor. as above: and
some allow also عَبَّيْتُ with teshdeed and ى
[which is commonly used in the present day]:
(Msb:) [and عَبَوْتُ also, inf. n. عَبْوٌ:] or عَبَأَ, (S,
O, K,) aor. as above, (K,) and so the inf. n.;
(S, O;) and ↓ عبّأ, inf. n. تَعْبِئَةٌ and تَعْبِىْءٌ; (S,
O, K;) he prepared, set in order, disposed, or
arranged, goods, or utensils: (S, O, K:) and
each, (K,) or the former, (Msb,) or the latter,
(S, O,) and عبّى, with teshdeed and ى, (Msb,)
[agreeably with the authority of Yoo, for] Yoo
used to say تَعْبِيَةُ الجَيْشِ, without ء, (S, O,) he
fitted out with the requisite equipage &c., (K,) or
prepared, (O,) or set in order, disposed, or
arranged, (O, Msb,) or set in order, disposed, or
arranged, in their places, and prepared for war
or fight, (TA,) the horsemen, (S, O,) or the
army. (Msb, K, TA.) And عَبَأْتُ لَهُ شَرًّا I prepared for him evil, or mischief. (TA.) ―
-b2-  عَبَأَ,
(AZ, S, O, K,) aor. as above, (TA,) and so
the inf. n., (AZ, S, O,) also signifies He made,
(K,) or prepared and made, (AZ, S, O,) and
mixed, perfume; (AZ, S, O, K;) and so ↓ عبّأ,
inf. n. تَعْبِئَةٌ and تَعْبِىْءٌ; and عبّى. (TA.) [And
accord. to an explanation of the inf. n. in the
KL, it seems that عَبَأَ signifies He excited a good,
or pleasant, odour; as rendered by Golius: but
this I think doubtful.] ―
-b3-  مَا أَعْبَأُ بِهِ means What
shall I do with it? (T, K, TA,) namely, the
affair. (T, TA.) مَا يَعْبَأُ بِكُمْ رَبِّى, in the Kur
[xxv. last verse], is said by Mujáhid to mean
What will my Lord do with you? but see another
explanation of this in what follows. (TA.) ―
-b4-
And it signifies also I do not care for, mind,
heed, or regard, him: (S, O, Msb, K:) or I do
not receive with approbation anything from him,
nor anything of his discourse: (Aboo-'Adnán,
TA:) or, accord. to Aboo-Is-hák [i. e. Zj], I do
not hold him to be of any weight or worth; do not
esteem him: and he says that مَا يَعْبَأُ بِكُمْ رَبِّى, of
which an explanation has been given above,
means What weight have ye in the estimation of
my Lord? (TA.) One says also, مَا عَبَأْتُ بِهِ
شَيْئًا, meaning I did not reckon him as anything;
or did not esteem him at all. (Aboo-'Abd-Er-Rahmán, TA.) And مَا عَبَأْتُ لَهُ شَيْئًا I did not
care for, mind, heed, or regard, him: (T, TA:)
or so مَا عَبَأْتُ بِهِ. (Msb.) And قَدْ عَبَأَ اللّٰهُ عَنْهُ
God has received with approbation everything
from him. (Aboo-'Adnán, TA.) ―
-b5-  And عَبَأَ لَهُ
He thought it, or opined it, and held it, or took
to it as a tenet. (O, TA.)

says also that عَبْوَةٌ signifies the same; (TA;) or
so عَبْوٌ; (TA in art. عبو;) the pl. of which is
