written in [some of] the copies of the K يُعْطِينِى,

إِعْطَآءٌ, (K, MF, TA,) and ↓ مُعَاطَاةٌ (S, Msb,
K) and عِطَآءٌ, (K,) The act of giving, presenting,
or offering; or giving with the hand in the way
of presenting or offering; syn. مُنَاوَلَةٌ (S, Msb, K,
MF, TA) عَلَى جِهَةِ التَّقْرِيبِ; and إِعْطَآءٌ has been
expl. as syn. with إِيتآءٌ; but several authors make
a distinction between these two words, saying
that the latter is sometimes obligatory and sometimes by way of favour, whereas the former is
never but by way of sheer favour; as El-Fakhr
Er-Rázee says; though most of the leading lexicologists know not this distinction. (MF, TA.)
One says, أَعْطَاهُ الشَّىْءَ; and إِيَّاهُ ↓ عَاطَاهُ, inf. n.
مُعَاطَاةٌ and عِطَآءٌ; He gave him, &c., the thing.
(TA.) And اعطاهُ مَالًا [He gave him, &c., property]. (S.) And أَعْطَيْتُهُ دِرْهَمًا I gave him, &c.,
a dirhem. (Msb.) And as the signification of
this verb does not depend upon the condition of
taking, or receiving, but only upon giving, or delivering, one may say, أَعْطَيْتُهُ فَمَا أَخَذَ [I gave,
or delivered, &c., to him, and he did not take, or
receive]. (Msb.) [See also a verse cited in the
first paragraph of art. رأم, in which this verb has
a single objective complement with بِ redundantly prefixed to it.] ―
-b2-  اعطى, (S,) inf. n. as
above, (K,) signifies also (tropical:)  He was, or became,
tractable, manageable, or submissive; (S, K, TA;)
said of a camel: (S:) and اعطى بِيَدِهِ [lit. he
gave his hand, said of a man,] signifies the same:
accord. to Er-Rághib, اعطى, said of a camel,
primarily signifies he gave his head, and did not
resist. (TA.) [Hence,] one says to a tractable
camel, when his haltering becomes loosed (lit.
opened) from his muzzle, أَعْطِ [meaning Give thy
head]; whereupon he bends his head towards
his rider, and he renews his haltering. (TA.) ―
-b3-
مَا أَعْطَاهُ لِلْمَالِ [How large a giver is he of property!] is like the phrase مَا أَوْلَاهُ لِلْمَعْرُوفِ, and
مَا أَكْرَمَهُ لِى; anomalous, because the verb of
wonder is not formed from the measure أَفْعَلَ,
and only what has been heard, of this kind, from
the Arabs, is allowable. (S, TA.)

-A3-  Also He hastened, or

[i. e. إِلَى الشَّىْءِ], inf. n. عَطْوٌ, He took the thing,

بِيَدِهِ إِلَى الإِنَآءِ ↓ عَطَا He took the vessel, or took it

-b2-  And The taking with the
hand (تَنَاوُل) what is not right, or just, or due.

-b3-  And The contending in taking. (K.) One

with the hand, one from another, and contended
together in doing it. (TA.) ―
-b4-  [And The contending in giving, presenting, or offering.] One

أَعْطُوهُ, (TA,) i. e. [We contended in giving, and it
may also mean in taking, and] I overcame, or
surpassed, him [therein]. (S, K, TA.) ―

ex. voce شَبَرٌ. ―
-b6-  And hence, The reciting, one

another, in reciting,] verses, or poetry, of the
metre termed رَجَز; as also تَنَازَعُوهُ. (TK in that
art.) ―
-b7-  And The standing upon the extremities
of the toes, with raising the hands to a thing. (K.)
And hence, (K, TA,) as some say, (TA,) فَتَعَاطَى
فَعَقَرَ, (K, TA,) in the Kur [liv. 29]: (TA:) for
this is said to mean And he stood upon the extremities of his toes, then raised his hands, and
smote her: (S, TA:) or this means and he took
the sword, (Ksh, Bd, Jel,) or the she-camel,
(Ksh,) and slew her: (Ksh, Bd, Jel:) or and he
emboldened himself &c.: (Ksh, Bd:) [for] ―

(K,) or a bad, or foul, thing or affair: (TA:)
or the former is used in relation to that which is
noble, or honourable; and ↓ the latter, in relation
to that which is bad, or foul. (K, TA.) And
one says, فُلَانٌ يَتَعَاطَى كَذَا (S, Msb) i. e. Such a
one enters into such a thing: (S:) or ventures
boldly, daringly, or courageously, upon such a
thing, and does it. (Msb.). [And Such a one
takes, or applies himself, to such a thing; as wine,
or the drinking thereof; and gaming: you say,
تعاطى الخَمْرَ; and المَيْسِرَ: see Ksh and Bd and
Jel in ii. 216.] And تَعَاطَى قَوْلَ الشِّعْرِ He affected to be a poet but was not. (TA in arr. شعر.)
