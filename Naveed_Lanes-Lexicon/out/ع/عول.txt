عَالَ عِيَالَهُ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, * K, TA,) aor.
يَعُولُ, (S, O, Msb,) inf. n. عَوْلٌ (S, O, Msb, K)
and عِيَالَةٌ (S, O, K) and عُوُولٌ; (K;) He fed,
nourished, or sustained, his family, or household,
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, * K, [in the Msb, اليَتِيمَ, the
orphan,]) and expended upon them: (S, Mgh, O:)
or he supplied them with what they needed of food
and clothing and other things: (TA:) and ↓ أَعَالَهُمْ
and ↓ عَيَّلَهُمْ signify the same. (K.) One says, عُلْتُهُ
شَهْرًا I supplied him with his means of subsistence
for a month. (S, O.) And it is said in a trad.,
اِبْدَأْ بِمَنْ تَعُولُ i. e. [Begin thou] with those
whom thou sustainest, and whose expenses are incumbent on thee; and if anything remain over
and above, let it be for the strangers, or those
who are not related to thee. (TA.)
-A2-  And عال,
(Ks, K, TA,) aor. as above, (Ks, TA,) inf. n.
عَوْلٌ and عِيَالَةٌ (K, TA) and عُوُولٌ, (TA,) He had
a numerous family or household; (K, TA;) [and]
so ↓ اعال, (Z, Mgh, O, Msb,) and ↓ أَعْوَلَ, (Z, O,
K,) and ↓ أَعْيَلَ, (Msb, K, TA,) this last formed
by the change of و into ى, (TA,) [or formed
from عِيَالٌ,] and عيل [i. e. ↓ عَيَّلَ]: (Msb:) ↓ اعال
is also expl. as meaning [simply] he had a family,
or household: and ↓ أَعْوَلَتْ, occurring in a trad.,
as meaning she brought forth children, is said by
IAth to be originally أَعْيَلَتْ, signifying she had
a family, or household; but Z says that اعيلت
is formed with a regard to the word عِيَالٌ, and
is not the original form. (TA.) [See also 4 in
art. عيل.] مَا لَهُ عَالَ وَمَالَ is a form of imprecation, meaning [What ails him?] May he have a
numerous family or household, and may he decline
from the right course in his judgment. (K. [See
another explanation in art. عيل.]) And the saying, in the Kur [iv. 3], ذٰلِكَ أَدْنَى أَلَّا تَعُولُوا has
been expl. as meaning [That will be more, or
most, apt, fit, or proper,] that ye may not
have numerous families or households. (TA.) ―
-b2-
[Hence, probably,] عال, aor. as above, [and يَعِيلُ,
(see 1 in art. عيل,)] signifies also He (a man)
was, or became, poor; (Ks, TA;) [and] so
↓ اعال. (K.) And Yoo says that لَا يَعُولُ عَلَى
القَصْدِ أَحَدٌ signifies لَا يَحْتَاجُ [app. meaning No
one will become poor, or in want, while following
the right course]: (TA:) and so لَا يَعِيلُ. (TA
in art. عيل.)
-A3-  عال المِيزَانُ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,
K,) aor. يَعُولُ and يَعِيلُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. عَوْلٌ
and عَيْلٌ, (TA,) The balance inclined, or declined,
(S, Mgh, O, Msb,) and rose: (Mgh, Msb:) or
one of its extremities rose above the other: (TA:)
or it was, or became, defective, and declined from
the right state: or [in the CK “ and ”] it was, or
became, excessive. (K, TA.) And [hence,] عال
فِى المِيزَانِ (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, unfaithful; or
he acted unfaithfully. (Msb.) A poet says,
قَالُوا اتَّبْعْنَا رَسُولَ اللّٰهِ وَاطَّرَحُوا
قَوْلَ الرَّسُولِ وَعَالُوا فِى المَوَازِينِ
[They said, “We have followed the way of the
Apostle of God: ” but they have rejected the saying of the Apostle, (assumed tropical:)  and been false in the balances,
i. e., unfaithful]. (S, O.) ―
-b2-  And عال, (inf. n.
عَوْلٌ, Msb,) He (a judge, Mgh) deviated from
the right course, or acted wrongfully, (S, Mgh, O,
Msb, K,) فِى الحُكْمِ [in the judgment]. (S, O.)
Hence, in the Kur [iv. 3, mentioned above], أَلَّا
تَعُولُوا [that ye may not deviate from the right
course], (S, Mgh, O, Msb, TA,) accord. to Mujá-
hid, (S, O, Msb,) and most of the expositors.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And hence, (S, Mgh, O,) in the opinion
of A'Obeyd, (S, O,) عَالَتِ الفَرِيضَةُ, (S, Mgh, O,
Msb, K,) aor. تَعُولُ, (TA,) inf. n. عَوْلٌ, (S, Mgh,
O, Msb,) The فَرِيضَة [or primarily-apportioned
inheritance] deviated [by excess] from the limit of
the named [primary] portions [which are all fractions of four and twenty]; (Bd in iv. 3;) [meaning] it rose [above], (S, O, Msb, K,) or exceeded,
(K,) in the reckoning, (Msb, K,) [the regular
sum of the fixed primary portions,] i. e., its [fixed
primary], portions exceeded [the regular sum
thereof], occasioning a diminution to the sharers:
(S, Mgh, O, Msb:) العَوْلُ in this case being the
contr. of الرَّدُّ [which I do not find in any lexicon,
but only in dictionaries of conventional terms].
(Msb.) Az relates, of El-Mufaddal, that, application having been made to him respecting [the
shares of inheritance of] two daughters and a
father and a mother and a wife, said, “Her [the
wife's] eighth has become a ninth: ” and A' Obeyd
says, he meant that the [primary] portions had
exceeded [the regular sum] so that there fell to
the wife the ninth, whereas in the original case
she would have had the eighth; for if the فريضة
had not exceeded [the regular sum], it would
have consisted of four and twenty; but when it
[so] exceeded, it became of seven and twenty;
and there pertained to the two daughters the two
thirds [of four and twenty], i. e. sixteen portions;
and to the father and the mother the two sixths,
i. e. eight portions; and to the wife three reckoned
as of seven and twenty, i. e. the ninth, whereas,
before the exceeding, it would have been three
of four and twenty, i. e. the eighth: and this
question is called المَسْأَلَةُ المِنْبَرِيَّةُ, because 'Alee
was asked respecting it when he was on the
pulpit, and said, without premeditation, “Her
eighth has become a ninth. ” (TA.) Hence the
saying, in a trad. of Maryam, [i. e. the Virgin
Mary, respecting a story to which allusion is
made in the Kur iii. 39, (see a note on that verse
in Sale's Translation,)] وَعَالَ قَلَمُ زَكَرِيَّآءَ i. e. [And
the divining-arrow of Zacharias] rose upon the
water. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And one says also, عال زَيْدٌ
الفَرَائِضَ, (S, Mgh, O,) or الفَرِيضَةَ, (Msb,) first
pers. عُلْتُهَا, (K,) meaning Zeyd made the فرائض,
or فريضة, to be as described above; as also ↓ أَعَالَهَا;
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, K; *) which latter is the more
common. (Msb.) ―
-b5-  عال said of an affair, or
event, It was, or became, hard to be borne, severe,
or distressing, and great, or formidable. (S, O,
K.) ―
-b6-  And also, (S, O, K,) aor. يَعُولُ, (S. O,)
inf. n. عَوْلٌ, (TA,) It (a thing) overcame a person;
burdened, or oppressed, him; (S, O, K;) distressed
him; (Fr, O;) and disquieted him, or rendered
him anxious. (K.) [See an ex. in a verse cited
voce مَسَافَةٌ, in art. سوف.] One says, عِيلَ مَا هُوَ
عَائِلُهُ i. e. غُلِبَ مَا هُوَ غَالِبُهُ [May he be overcome!
Of what is he the overcomer?]: (S, Meyd, O, K:)
a prov., (Meyd,) applied to him at whose speech,
or some other thing proceeding from him, (S,
Meyd, O, K,) of a like sort, (K,) one wonders:
(S, Meyd, O, K:) it is of the nature of a prayer,
(S, Meyd, O,) for the man; (Meyd;) like the
saying, when a thing pleases one, قَاتَلَهُ اللّٰهُ, and
أَخْزَاهُ اللّٰهُ. (TA.) And عِيلَ صَبْرِى My patience
was overcome; (S, O, K;) and so عَالَ صَبْرِى:
(Abu-l-Jarráh, Lh, K:) or, accord. to Aboo-
Tálib, the former may mean رُفِعَ [i. e., was taken
away, lit. raised; and if so, the latter may in
like manner mean اِرْتَفَعَ]. (TA.) عَالَتِ البَيْقُورَ,
occurring in a verse of Umeiyeh Ibn-Abi-s-Salt,
refers to a year of drought, and means It oppressed
the [wild] oxen, by occasioning their having سَلَع
and عُشَر tied to their tails and set on fire, and
being made to ascend upon the mountain; by
the doing of which, the Arabs asserted that they
obtained rain. (S, O. [See art. سلع.]) ―
-b7-  عَالَكَ
عَالِيًا [in which عَالَكَ app. signifies properly رَفَعَكَ,
the agent (اللّٰهُ) being understood,] is like the saying لَعًا لَكَ عَالِيًا, (K, TA, [in the CK لَعا لَكَ,]) and
is expl. in the T as meaning Mayest thou rise, or
be raised, after stumbling, or falling. (TA.) ―
-b8-
عِيلَ عَوْلُهُ [app. signifying lit. May the wailing for
him be raised (in the CK عَوْلَةً)] means may his
mother be bereft of him; as also عَالَ عَوْلُهُ. (K,
TA.)
2
عَيَّلَهُمْ [app. formed from عِيَالٌ, in which the
ى is originally و]: see 1, first sentence. ―
-b2-  It
signifies also He made them to become what are
termed عِيَال [i. e. a family, or household]: or he
neglected them: (K:) or تَعْيِيلٌ signifies the feeding badly. (S and O in art. عيل.)
-A2-  عيّل as intrans.: see 1, fourth sentence.
-A3-  عوّل عَلَيْهِ He
acted, or behaved, with boldness, or presumptuousness, towards him; or confided in his love, and
therefore acted presumptuously towards him; and
he put, or imposed as a burden, upon him [some
affair]; (AZ, S, O, K;) as also عَلَيْهِ ↓ أَعْوَلَ, (K,
TA,) part. n. ↓ مُعْوِلٌ. (TA.) One says, عَوَّلْتُ,
عَلَى فُلَانٍ I put, or imposed as a burden, upon
such a one, somewhat of my affair: and عَوِّلْ عَلَىَّ
Put thou, or impose thou as a burden, upon me
what thou desirest. (Ham p. 125.) ―
-b2-  And He
asked aid of him; (K, TA;) as also عوّل بِهِ.
(TA.) One says, عَوِّلٌ عَلَىَّ بِما شِئْتَ Ask thou
aid of me in what thou wilt; as though he said,
put thou, or impose thou as a burden, upon me,
what thou likest. (S, O.) ―
-b3-  And He relied upon
it, or confided in it; (Msb, K;) namely, a thing;
as also عوّل بِهِ; inf. n. تَعْوِيلٌ (Msb) and ↓ مُعَوَّلٌ,
(K, TA,) thus on the authority of Th, who thus
explains it in the saying, (TA,) of Imra-el-
Keys, (O,)
وَإنَّ شِفَائِى عَبْرَةٌ مُهَرَقَةٌ
فَهَلْ عِنْدَ رَسْمٍ دَارِسٍ مِنْ مُعَوَّلِ
[When verily my cure is a flow of tears poured
forth: but is there reliance, or confidence, to be
felt at the remains of an abode becoming rased, or
effaced?]: or ↓ مُعَوَّل is here an inf. n. of عَوَّلْتُ in
the sense of أعْوَلْتُ, i. e. بَكَيْتُ; so that the meaning is, weeping: (TA:) or it here means a place
of weeping: or, as some say, a seeking of any
means of profiting. (O. [See also EM pp. 6
and 7.]) One says likewise, ↓ عَلَيْهِ المُعَوَّلُ, meaning [Upon him is placed] reliance. (TA.)
-A4-

-A5-  And عوّل, (K, and Ham p. 125,)
or عوّل عَالَةً, (S, O,) inf. n. تَعْوِيلٌ, (K,) signifies

and then covering them with small lopped wood
such as is used for firewood. (Ham.)

i. e. raised his voice with weeping, (S, K,) and
cried out; (K;) or wept, and cried out; عَلَيْهِ for

a verse of 'Obeyd-Allah Ibn-'Abd-Allah Ibn-'Otbeh, cited by Th, of اعول trans. by itself, عَلَى
being suppressed. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] one says
also, أَعْوَلَتِ القَوْسُ (assumed tropical:)  The bow produced a sound:

وَلَا مَالٌ, which means He has not anything belonging to him. (K.)
عَوْلٌ: see عَوِيلٌ. ―
-b2-  عَوْلَ is a word like وَيْبَ:
one says, عَوْلَكَ and عَوْلَ زَيْدٍ [i. e. May God
decree thy woe and the woe of Zeyd, virtually
meaning woe to thee and woe to Zeyd]: (S, O,
K:) and عَوْلٌ لِزَيْدٍ [lit. meaning Woe to Zeyd]:
(S, O:) or, accord. to Sb and others, عَوْلَ is used
only as a sequent to وَيْلَ; they said وَيْلَهُ وَعَوْلَهُ;
in which, Az says, ويل and عول both signify
weeping, or lamentation with tears; and Aboo-
Tálib says that they are put in the accus. case as
expressive of an imprecation and of blame, like as
is done in the sayings وَيْلًا لَهُ and تُرَابًا لَهُ. (TA.)
-A2-  Also Any affair, or event, that renders one
anxious: (K, * TA:) app. an inf. n. used thus as

عِوَلٌ is [said to be] a subst. signifying Reliance,
and confidence: (S, * K, TA:) and [it is said that]
هُوَ عِوَلِى signifies He is my stay, or support: the
word, however, occurs in this form, twice, in a
verse of Taäbata-sharrà, accord. to the relation
thereof by Aboo-'Ikrimeh; but accord. to others
it is ↓ عَوَلٌ, with fet-h to the ع and و, and is said
to be an inf. n.; whereas the former is said to be
pl. of ↓ عَوْلَةٌ; [and the two words signify, respectively, a weeping and weepings; for] by his saying
لٰكِنَّمَا عَِوَلِى إِنْ عَِوَلٍ
the poet means If I wept for any one, I would
weep &c. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And عِوَلٌ is also a subst. signifying An asking for aid. (K, TA.)

ظُلَّة, (S, O,) used as a shelter from the rain, (S,

(TA.) ―
-b2-  And i. q. نَعَامَةٌ, (Kr, K,) either as
meaning The species of animal thus called [i. e.

K:) or a weeping and crying out: (Msb:) and
sometimes it signifies a cry, or voice, from the
chest, without weeping: (O, TA:) and sometimes
↓ عَوْلَةٌ signifies the burning sensation of grief and
of love, without a raising of the voice and without
weeping. (TA.) [See also عَوَّالٌ.]
-A2-  Also Weak:
―
-b2-  and hence it is used as a name for One of the
ropes of a ship or boat. (TA.)
عِيَالٌ, belonging to this art. and to art. عيل;
(K, mentioned in the S and O in the latter art.;)
or its ى is substituted for و, for it is from عَالَ,
aor. يَعُولُ, in the first of the senses expl. above,
and seems to be an inf. n. used in the sense of a
pass. part. n.; (IB, TA;) [and if so, it may be
used as a sing. (as it is in the Ksh and by Bd in
xvi. 78 and in the S and Mgh &c. voce كَلٌّ and
in the O and K voce حَمِيلَةٌ) and also as a pl.;
but in general] it signifies A family, or household; (Msb;) [i. e.,] a man's عِيَال are the persons
whom he feeds, nourishes, or sustains; (S, O, Msb,
K;) or the persons who dwell with him, and whose
expenses are incumbent on him, as his young man,
or slave, his wife, and his young child: (KT:)
and ↓ عَيِّلٌ signifies the same: (K:) or this latter
(which is originally عَيْوِلٌ, TA) is sing. of عِيَالٌ
x(S, Mgh, O, Msb) and of عَيَائِلُ, (S, O,) like as
جَيِّدٌ is sing. of جِيَادٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb) and of
جَيَائِدُ; (S, O;) the last being a pl. pl., (K in art.
عيل,) [as also عِيَالَاتٌ, of which see an ex. voce
أزْمَلٌ;] but is sometimes used as a pl., for عَشَرَةُ
عَيِّلٍ, accord. to an ex. in a trad., signifies ten
persons fed, nourished, or sustained, by a man:
(TA:) or the pl. [of ↓ عَيِّلٌ] is عَالَةٌ, (Kr, K,)
[like as سَادَةٌ is said to be pl. of سَيِّدٌ,] or, accord.
to ISd, it is pl. of عَائِلٌ, [q. v. in art. عيل, and in
like manner سَادَةٌ is held by him to be pl. of سَائِدٌ,
not of سَيِّدٌ,] for [he says that] a word of the
measure فَيْعِلٌ never forms a pl. [like عَالَةٌ, which
is] of the measure فَعَلَةٌ; (TA;) and [عَيَائِلُ is
applied to women, for] one says نِسْوَةٌ عَيَائِلُ. (K.)

-b2-  One says أَمْرٌ
عَائِلٌ and عَالٍ, the latter being formed by transposition, meaning [An affair, or event,] hard to

-b3-  عَائِلٌ applied to a measure of
capacity means Exceeding others. (IAar, TA in
art. عيل.)
عَيِّلٌ: see عِيَالٌ, in two places.
أَعْوَلُ i. q. أَشَدُّ [More, and most, hard to be
borne, &c.]: and أَعْلَى, occurring in a verse of
Aboo-Dhu-eyb, signifies the same, being formed
from أَعْوَلُ by transposition. (TA.)
مَعُولٌ [Fed, nourished, or sustained: &c.
-A2-
And] Overcome: applied in this sense to patience:
(K:) and to a man, in respect of his opinion, or
judgment. (TA.)
مُعْوَلٌ, followed by عَلَيْهِ, Wailed for: thus in
the trad., المُعْوَلُ عَلَيْهِ يُعَذَّبُ, (S, O,) or, as some

wailed for will be punished. (O.)

measure]: (TA: [see also art. عيل:]) or ↓ مُعَيَّلٌ
signifies one whose property is deficient and whose
family, or household, have overcome him. (TA
in art. خلع.)
-A2-  See also 4, last sentence.
مُعَوَّلٌ One of whom aid, or succour, is asked:
(S, O, TA:) and one upon whom reliance, or confidence is placed. (TA.) One says, مَا لَهُ فِى القَوْمِ

any of whom aid is [to be] asked. (S, O.) [See
also عَوْلٌ.]
