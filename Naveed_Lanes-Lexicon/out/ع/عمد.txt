it is probably correct, (see its pass. part. n. in
this art.,)] he placed beneath it columns, pillars, or

aimed at it; sought, or endeavoured, after it; or
tended, repaired, or betook himself, to it, or

عَيْنٍ, (S, O, Msb, K,) and عَمْدَ عَيْنٍ, (S, A, O,
Msb, K,) I did it seriously, or in earnest, and
with certain knowledge, or assurance. (S, A, O,
Msb, K. [See also عَيْنٌ.]) When a man sees a
bodily form and imagines it to be an object of
the chase and therefore shoots at it, he cannot
use this phrase, for he only aims at what is an
object of the chase in his imagination: so says
Sgh. (Msb.)

by being [much] ridden, while the outer part remained whole, or sound: (S, O, L, K:) or he had
his hump swollen in consequence of the galling of

الرُّكُوبِ His buttocks became swollen, and quivered,
or throbbed, in consequence of [long and hard]
riding. (En-Nadr, O, K.) And عَمِدَ, aor. and

and أَبِدَ]. One says, عَمِدَ عَلَيْهِ He was angry
with him. (T, L.) ―
-b5-  [And He wondered.] One
says, أَنَا أَعْمَدُ مِنْهُ I wonder at him, or it: (S, O,
L, K:) or, as some say, I am angry at him, or
it: and some say that it means I lament at, or
complain of, him, or it. (L.) أَعْمَدُ مِنْ سَيِّدٍ قَتَلَهُ
قَوْمُهُ (S, O, L) i. e. Do I wonder at a chief whom
his [own] people have slain? (L) was said by
Aboo-Jahl (S, O, L) when he lay prostrated at
Bedr; meaning, hath anything more happened
than the slaughter of a chief by his [own] people?
this is not a disgrace [to him]: he meant thereby
that the destruction that befell him was a light
matter to him: (A'Obeyd, L:) the saying is interrogative; (Sh, L;) أَعْمَدُ being app. contracted
from أَأَعْمَدُ, by the suppression of one of the two
hemzehs. (Az, L.) And أَعْمَدُ مِنْ كَيْلٍ مُحِّقَ,
as related by A'Obeyd, [and thus in the O, in
two copies of the S written مُحِقّ, and in a third
copy omitted,] or مُحِقَ, without teshdeed, as
seen by Az written in an old book, [i. e. Do I
wonder at a measure incompletely filled?] is a
saying of the Arabs, expl. in the book above
alluded to, and, Az thinks, correctly, as meaning
is it anything more than a measure incompletely
filled? [and in a similar manner, but not so fully,
expl. in two copies of the S and in the O:] or,
accord. to IB, is it anything more than the fact
of my measure's being incompletely filled? (L:)

the saying of Aboo-Jahl. (From a marginal note
in one of my copies of the S.) ―

Sacy's Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed., i. 315),] (tropical:)  I relied upon the book, and held to it: a metaphorical
phrase, from the first above. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  [Hence
also the phrase, used by grammarians, يَعْتَمِدُ عَلَى
