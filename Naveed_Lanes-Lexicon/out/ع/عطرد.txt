عطردQ. 1
عَطْرِدْهُ لَنَا Make thou it to be to us, (O,
K,) with thee, or in thy estimation, (O,) like the
promise, (كَالعِدَةِ, K, TA, inf. n. of وَعَدَ, and
this is the only explanation given by the leading
authorities on strange words, TA, [in the O,
كَالعِدَّةِ,]) or like the apparatus that is prepared
for the casualties of fortune; (كَالعُدَّةِ and العَتَادِ;
Ibn-'Abbád, O, K;) and ↓ اِجْعَلْهُ لَنَا عُطْرُودًا signifies the same. (O, K.)
عَطَرَّدٌ i. q. عَطَوَّدٌ in its several meanings: (K:)
signifying High, applied to a mountain: ―
-b2-  and
Tall, applied to a man or camel: (L:) ―
-b3-  and
Long, applied to a day; and to a limit, term,
reach, or goal, or to a heat, or single run to a
goal or limit; (S, O, L;) and to a road: (L:)
―
-b4-  and Generous, noble, or liberal, applied to a
man: (O:) ―
-b5-  and Quick, applied to a pace, or
rate of going: (L:) ―
-b6-  and Sharpened, applied
to a spear-head. (O.)
اِجْعَلْهُ لَنَا عُطْرُودًا: see the first paragraph.
عُطَارِدٌ or عُطَارِدُ, (accord. to different copies of
the S,) or both, being perfectly and imperfectly
decl., (K,) but what is the cause of its being imperfectly decl., with the quality of a proper name,
requires consideration, (MF,) [The planet Mercury;] the star of the scribes; (Az, TA:) one of
the stars called الخُنَّسُ; (S, O, K:) accord. to
the K [and O], in the sixth heaven [or sphere]:
but the sheykh 'Alee El-Makdisee says that this
is a mistake, for it is well known to be in one
second. (TA.)
