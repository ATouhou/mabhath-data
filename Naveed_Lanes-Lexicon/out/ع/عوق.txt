[Accord. to the S and O and K, the first is syn.
with حَبَسَهُ and صَرَفَهُ, and so is the last accord. to

are also the first and second accord. to the K and
TA: accord. to the Msb, the first and third and
fourth are syn. with مَنَعَهُ.] And عَقَاهُ signifies the

لَاقَتْ عِنْدَ زَوْجِهَا, (O, K,) means She did not
cleave, or stick, to the heart of her husband;
(S, O, K, TA;) to which IKtt adds, and did not
hinder him from separating himself from her, or
marrying another: and some say that it means
she was not happy with her husband; near to his
heart; in favour with him, or beloved by him:
and some, that عَاقَتْ is an imitative adjunct to
لَاقَتْ, because the latter signifies لَصِقَتْ. (TA.)

quality of hindering, preventing, impeding, retarding, or diverting by otherwise occupying, (S,
O, K, TA,) men from that which is good, and
his companions, because accidents diverting him
from his course prevent his attaining the object

[accomplishing] their affairs: (O, K:) or it signifies, (K,) or signifies also, accord. to IDrd, (O,)
a coward, or cowardly; (O, K;) in this sense
peculiar to the dial. of Hudheyl; (O;) and so
عُوَقٌ: and عُوَقٌ is also syn. with ↓ عَائِقٌ: (K:)
thus it means accord. to Aboo-Usámeh, as an
epithet applied to a man: (O:) and ↓ عُوَّقٌ (O,
K) accord. to him (O) is pl. of ↓ عَائِقٌ: (O, K:)
and عُوَقٌ and ↓ عُوَّقٌ both signify also one whom
affairs cease not to hinder, prevent, impede, &c.,
from [accomplishing] the object of his want: and
one who, when he purposes a thing, does it: (K:)
thus they are expl. by Ibn-'Abbád; as though
having two contr. significations. (O.)

the horse; as also وَعِيقٌ. (TA.)
عَائِقٌ and ↓ عَوْقٌ and ↓ عُوقٌ and ↓ عَوِقٌ all signify the same; (K, TA;) i. e. [A person, or
thing,] hindering, preventing, impeding, withholding, turning back or away, retarding, or diverting
by occupying otherwise: (TA:) see also عُوَقٌ, in
two places: the pl. of the first is عُوَّقٌ. (O, K.)
One says, عَاقَنِى عَائِقٌ (K, TA) and عَقَانِى عَاقٍ

impediment, &c., hindered me, or impeded me,
&c.,] عَنِ الأَمْرِ الَّذِى أَرَدْتُ [from the thing that I
desired to do]. (TA.) And عَوَائِقُ الدَّهْرِ signifies
The accidents, or casualties, of time or fortune,
that divert [or hinder or impede] by busying or
occupying or employing: (S, O, K, TA:) the
former noun being pl. of عَائِقَةٌ, or anomalously of

ضَيِّقٌ لَيِّقٌ عَيِّقٌ (K) or ضَيِّقٌ عَيِّقٌ لَيِّقٌ (IAar, TA)
[app. meaning Very niggardly]: or, as some say,
عَيِّقٌ signifies as expl. voce عُوَقٌ, and is not an
imitative sequent. (TA.)
العَيُّوقُ A red [?] bright star in, or on, the
right [?] edge of the Milky Way, following, not
preceding, الثُّرَيَّا [the Pleiades]; rising before
الجَوْزَآء [by which may be meant either Orion or
Gemini]: (TA:) when it has risen, it is known
that الثُّرَيَّا has risen: (O:) [it is the well-known
name of the star Capella, notwithstanding its
being described above as “ red,” and as in, or
on, the “ right ” of the Milky Way; for Capella,
though not now red, has been observed to alter
in brightness by astronomers in very recent times;
and I think that the word rendered above “ right,”
which is أَيْمَن, is probably a mistranscription for
أَيْسَر, i. e. “ left: ” the description here following
plainly indicates Capella:] it is the bright star [a]
upon the left shoulder of Auriga: that upon the
left elbow is العَنْزُ: the two on the left wrist
together with العيّوق are called العِنَازُ: [see عَنْزٌ:]
it is also called the رَقِيب [or watcher] of الثُّرَيَّا,
because it rises therewith at many places: and
the star on the right shoulder [i. e.
β] with the
two upon the ankle-joints [which may be
θ and
ι,
for the constellation, is variously figured,] are
called تَوابِعُ العَيُّوقِ: (Kzw:) it is [said to be]
called العيّوق because of its [being regarded as]
impeding الدَّبَرَان from meeting الثُّرَيَّا: (TA:)
عَيُّوق, (Lth, Az, S, O,) is originally عَيْوُوق, (S, O,)
its medial radical being و; or it may be ى. (Lth,
Az, TA.) One says also, هٰذَا عَيُّوقُ طَالِعًا [meaning This is العَيُّوقُ rising]; suppressing the ال,
but meaning it to be understood, and therefore
leaving the word itself in its former determinate
state [without tenween]. (IAar, TA.)
مُعْوِقٌ One who is disappointed of attaining his
object [by the failing of his beast or of his
travelling-provision: see أَعْوَقَ]; syn. مُخْفِقٌ.
(Ibn-' Abbád, O, K.) ―
-b2-  And Hungry. (Ibn-
'Abbád, O, K.)
يَعُوقُ A certain idol which pertained to the
people of Noah: (S, O, K:) or originally a certain righteous man in his age, of whom and of
seven other righteous men after him, by the direction of the Devil, were made images, which in
process of time became objects of worship: (Lth,
O, K:) or a certain idol which pertained to [the
tribe of] Kináneh, (Zj, TA,) or to Murád. (Ksh
and Bd in lxxi. 23.) [See also وَدٌّ.]
