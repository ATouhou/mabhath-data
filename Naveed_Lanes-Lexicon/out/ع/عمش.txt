عمش1
عَمِشَ, (S, TA,) aor.
عَمَشَ, (TA,) inf. n. عَمَشٌ,
(S, A, O, K,) He (a man, S, TA) was weak in
sight, (S, A, O, K,) and generally, or at most
times, shedding tears. (S, O, K.) And عَمِشَتِ
العَيْنُ, aor. and inf. n. as above, The eye was
generally, or at most times, shedding tears, and
weak in sight. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (A,) عَمِشَ فِيهِ,
said of speech, (assumed tropical:)  It produced a good effect upon
him. (A, O, K.) And فُلَانٌ لَا تَعْمَشُ فِيهِ المَوْعِظَةُ
(assumed tropical:)  Such a one, exhortation produces no good effect
upon him. (A, O.) Both of these are chaste
phrases; for when exhortation produces an effect
upon a man, it becomes as though it were weaksighted, seeing nothing to amend in him. (A.)

تَعْمِيشٌ The removing of [the weakness of
sight termed] عَمَش [inf. n. of عَمِشَ, q. v.]. (O, K.)
10
استعمشهُ He deemed him foolish, or stupid,
(O, K, TA,) or, as in the Tekmileh, ignorant:
(TA:) but this is post-classical. (O, TA.)
أَعْمَشُ A man weak in sight, and generally, or
at most times, shedding tears: fem. عَمْشَآءُ: (S,
Msb:) pl. عُمْشٌ; (Msb, TA;) which is also
applied to camels: (TA:) or disordered in the
eye; whose eyes are dim, or watery; and أَغْمَصُ
signifies the like. (L, TA.)
