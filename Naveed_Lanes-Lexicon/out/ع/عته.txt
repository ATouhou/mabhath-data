(TA.)
عَتَهٌ [see 1, first sentence, where it is mentioned
as an inf. n.]. العَتَهُ is An evil affection, of
essential origin, necessarily occasioning unsoundness in the intellect; so that the person affected
therewith becomes confused in intellect; and therefore some of his speech resembles that of the
intelligent; and some, that of the possessed, or
mad: it differs from السَّفَهُ; for this does not
resemble possession, or madness. (KT.)
عُتَهٌ and ↓ عُتَهِىٌّ (so in the TA as from the K
[but not found by me in the latter]) and ↓ عُنْتُهٌ
and ↓ عُنْتُهِىٌّ (so too in the TA, but not as from
the K, [though I find these two words without
the two preceding in the copies of the K that I
have been able to consult,]) A man who greatly
exceeds the usual bounds in an affair. (K, TA.)

supposed, from the manner in which it is mentioned, to be a subst. from عُتِهَ in the last only of
the senses above assigned to it]; (K, TA;) as
also ↓ عَتَاهِيَةٌ: (TA:) or each is an inf. n. of that
verb [q. v.]. (Mgh, Msb.) ―
-b2-  See also the next
paragraph.
عَتَاهِيَةٌ: see عَتَاهَةٌ. ―
-b2-  Also Foolish, or stupid:
and so ↓ عُتَاهِيَةٌ; (Akh, S, K, TA;) applied to a
man. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And, in a pl. sense, The erring
of mankind; and so ↓ عَتَاهَةٌ; (K, TA;) which
latter signifies also, in a pl. sense, foolish, or
stupid. (TA.)
عُتَاهِيَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
عَاتِهٌ A man addicted to annoying another,
