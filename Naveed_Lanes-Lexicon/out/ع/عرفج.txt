عرفجعَرْفَجٌ A certain plant, (S,) or a sort of trees
[or shrubs], (K,) growing in plain, or soft, land:
n. un. with ة: (S, K:) it is said to be of the trees
[or shrubs] of the صَيْف [meaning either spring or
summer], soft, or pliable, dust-coloured, and having
a rough produce like the حَسَك [or prickly heads
of thistles and similar plants]: (TA:) Aboo-Ziyád says, (O, TA,) as related by AHn, (O,)
that it is of sweet, or pleasant, odour, dustcoloured, inclining to greenness, having a yellow
blossom; (O, TA;) and when it becomes aggregated and abundant in a place, that place is called
حَوْمَانٌ: (O:) it has no grains nor thorns: (O,
TA:) it and the ثُمَام and the ضَعَة grow in plain,
or soft, land, and on the mountain; and none of
these has thorns: its firewood is the best of firewood in odour, and the quickest in taking fire and
in blazing: (O:) AHn [also] says, certain of the
Arabs of the desert informed me that its root is
wide, occupying a [considerable] piece of ground;
and it sends forth many shoots, proportionate to
the root, without leaves, [but see خُوصٌ,] being
only slender shoots, at the extremities whereof are
[buds, or the like, such as are termed] زَمَع, at the
heads of which appears a yellow substance like
hair: and he says that, accord. to the ancient
Arabs of the desert, it occupies a space like that
of a man sitting, becomes white when it dries up,
has a yellow produce, is eaten in the fresh and
dry state by the camels and sheep or goats, and its
flame is intensely red, whence one says, كَأَنَّ لِحْيَتَهُ
ضِرَامُ عَرْفَجَةٍ or عَرْفَجٍ [As though his beard were
the blazing, or flaming, of an 'arfajeh or of 'arfaj].
(TA.) The fire of the عرفج is called نَارُ الزَّحْفَتَيْنِ
[The fire of the two walks]; because he who
kindles it walks to it, and when it burns up he
walks from it: (T, TA:) or because it quickly
blazes and quickly subsides; so when it blazes
they walk from it, and when it subsides they
walk to it. (O. [See also art. زحف.]) When
the greenness of plants appears in it, it is termed
عَرْفَجَةٌ خَاضِبَةٌ. (Aboo- 'Obeyd El-Bekree, TA.)
When it has been rained upon, and its stalk has
become soft, one says ثَقَّبَ عُودُ العَرْفَجِ: when it
has become somewhat black, قَمِلَ: when a little
more so, اِرْقَاطَّ: when more so, أَدْبَى: and when
its خُوص are perfect, أَخْوَصَ. (AA, TA.) ―
-b2-
كَمَنِّ الغَيْثِ عَلَى العَرْفَجَةِ [Like the benefit conferred by the rain upon the 'arfajeh], meaning
its falling upon it when dry, and causing it to
become green, is a prov., said, accord. to AZ, to
him upon whom thou hast conferred a benefit and
who says to thee, Dost thou confer a benefit upon
me? (TA.) ―
-b3-  لَىُّ العَرْفَجَةِ signifies A certain
mode of coïtus. (O, K.)
عَرَافِجُ Sands in which is no road. (O, K. [In
the latter it is expl. as though it were a proper
name.])
