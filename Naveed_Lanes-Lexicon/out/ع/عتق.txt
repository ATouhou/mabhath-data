and to horses; (K, TA;) or the عِتَاق of horses
are the generous, or excellent, thereof; and so of
birds; (Mgh;) [the noble thereof, in a sense
wider that that in which this epithet is applied
in English falconry;] or of birds, such as prey;
(S, O, K, TA;) عَتِيقٌ being applied to one of

even to a man: (S, L:) and the pl. is عِتَاقٌ, which
occurs in a trad. applied to the earlier verses of
the Kur-án that were revealed at Mekkeh, (L,
TA,) and عُتْقٌ, (S, K, *) or عُتُقٌ, with two dammehs, (Mgh, Msb,) like بُرُدٌ pl. of بَرِيدٌ, (Msb,)
applied to دَرَاهِم, (Mgh, Msb,) عُتْقٌ being [probably] a contraction of عُتُقٌ (like as بُرْدٌ is of بُرُدٌ)
and in like manner applied to دَنَانِير, (S,) [and
عُتَّقٌ occurs in the TA in art. سم, agreeably with
general analogy if pl. of عَاتِقٌ,] but عُتُّقٌ, with two
dammehs and teshdeed, is a mistake. (Mgh.)
البَيْتُ العَتِيقُ is an appellation of The Kaabeh,
(S, O, K,) given to it in the Kur-án [xxii. 30 and
34, as meaning the Old House], (O,) because it

O,) because عَتِيقَةٌ has the meaning of the measure
فَاعِلَةٌ, (S, O, K,) but جَدِيدٌ has the meaning of
the measure مَفْعُولَةٌ. (S, O.) And رَاحٌ عَتِيقٌ, (O,

(L, TA:) or of which no one has broken the seal
[upon the mouth of its jar]: (S, O, TA:) or that

says, [using it as an epithet in which the quality
of a subst. predominates,]
كَالْمِسْكَ تَخْلِطُهُ بِمَآءِ سَحَابَةٍ
أَوْ عَاتِقٍ كَدَمِ الذَّبِيحِ مُدَامِ
[Like musk which thou mixest with the water of a
cloud, or old wine (&c.) like the blood of the
slaughtered animal, made to continue long in its
unopened jar]. (S, O, TA: but the last, for
تَخْلِطُهُ, has مُخْتَلِطٌ.) ―

(S, O, TA,) i. e. of that of which the first feathers
have fallen off and strong feathers have grown;

(K, TA;) thought by A'Obeyd to be from the
meaning of “ outgoing,” or “ outstripping,” كَأَنَّهُ
يَعْتِقُ أَىْ يَسْبِقُ [as though it outwent, or outstripped]: (S, O, TA:) or of the young of the sandgrouse (القَطَا), or of the pigeon, while not yet firm,

kept behind the curtain in the tent, or house, of
her family, (S, O,) and not been separated to a

called because she has passed forth from the state
of childhood, and attained to being marriageable;
(O;) or because she has passed forth from the
state, or condition, of serving her father and
mother, and has not yet been possessed by a
husband; but AAF says that this is not valid:
or that has attained to the wearing of the garment
called دِرْع, and has passed forth from the state of
childhood and of being required to help in the
service of her family: (TA:) or such as is between the stages of puberty and middle age: (K:)

verse which is cited by IB [and in the O] as an
instance of its being fem. is asserted by some to
be forged: (TA:) the pl. is عَوَاتِقُ (Msb, K, and
Ham ubi suprà,) and عُتْقٌ. (K.) One says رَجُلٌ
