the K,) first pers. عَشَوْتُ, (S,) aor. يَعْشُو, (TA,)
inf. n. عَشْوٌ and عُشُوٌّ; (KL;) as also عَشِىَ, like
رَضِىَ [i. e. having for its aor. يَعْشَى, but the
inf. n. is app. عَشًا, as in the similar sense expl. in
the next sentence]; (TA, and so in my MS. copy
of the K;) i. q. ↓ تعشّى, (S, K, TA,) [which is
more commonly used than either of preceding
verbs, and] which signifies He ate the [eveningmeal, or evening-repast, or supper, i. e. what is
called the] عَشَآء. (Msb, K, TA.) And عَشِيَتِ
الإِبِلُ, (ISk, S, K, TA,) aor. تَعْشَى, inf. n. عَشًا,
(ISk, S, TA,) i. q. ↓ تَعَشَّت [i. e. The camels ate

(K, TA;) and inf. n. عَشْىٌ also, (TA, and thus in
some copies of the K,) thus correctly, as in the M,
عشيانًا in [some of] the copies of the K being a
mistake for عَشْيًا, the aor. being also يَعْشِيهِ; (TA;)
i. q. ↓ عشّاهُ, (S, Msb, K, TA,) [which is more commonly used than either of the preceding verbs,]
inf. n. تَعْشِيَةٌ, (S,) i. e. He fed him (namely, a

or evening-feed, i. e. what is called the] عَشَآء; (S,
Msb, K;) as also ↓ اعشاهُ: (K:) and عَشَا الإِبِلَ,
(K, TA,) like دَعَا [i. e. having for its aor. يَعْشُو];
(TA;) and ↓ عشّاها; He pastured the camels by
night. (K, TA.)
-A2-  عَشَوْتُهُ also signifies I repaired, or betook myself, to, or towards, him, or
it, by night: and hence ↓ عَاشٍ is applied to any
one repairing, or betaking himself, to or towards
[an object]. (S.) ―
-b2-  And عَشَوْتُ إِلَى النَّارِ, aor.
أَعْشُو, inf. n. عَشْوٌ, I sought to be directed, or
guided, or I directed, or guided, myself, by weak
eyesight, to the fire: (S:) or I looked at the fire,
or endeavoured to see it, and repaired, or betook
myself, to it, or towards it; and I saw it, or
looked towards it trying whether I could see it,
and sought to be directed, or guided, to it by its
light: (Har p. 535:) El-Hotei-ah says,
مَتَى تأْتِهِ تَعْشُو إِلَى ضَوْءِ نَارِهِ
تَجِدْ خَيْرَ نَارٍ عِنْدَهَا خَيْرُ مُوقِدِ
[When thou comest to him, looking with blinking
eyes towards the light of his fire and seeking to be
guided by it thereto, thou findest the best fire, and
at it is the best kindler]; meaning مَتَى تَأْتِهِ عَاشِيًا;
using the marfooa verb between two verbs whereof
each is mejzoom because the verb in the future
tense when it occurs in the place of a denotative
of state is marfooa: (S:) or عَشَا النَّارَ and إِلَى
النَّارِ, inf. n. عَشْوٌ and عُشُوٌّ; as also النَّارَ ↓ اعتشى
and بِالنَّارِ; signifies he saw the fire by night from
afar, and repaired, or betook himself, to it, or towards it, seeking to light himself thereby, (K, TA,)
and hoping to obtain thereby guidance and good.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And عَشَا عَنِ النَّارِ He turned away and
went from the light of the fire. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And
عَشَوْتُ عَنْهُ I went, or turned, from him, or it, to
another: whence, it is said, the saying in the
Kur [xlii. 35], وَمَنْ يَعْشُ عَنْ ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمٰنِ [And
such as turns from the admonition of the Compassionate]. (S. See another explanation of this
saying in what follows.) [This and other meanings expl. below are app. from what here next
follows.] ―
-b5-  عَشِىَ, aor. يَعْشَى, (S, Msb, K,) dual

had bad sight by night and by day: or he was,
or became, blind: [said of a man, and of a beast
of the equine kind, and of a camel, and of a bird:
(see عَشًا, below:)] and عَشَا, aor. يَعْشُو, signifies
the same: (K:) or the two verbs differ in meaning; so as that وَمَنْ يَعْشَ عَنْ ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمٰنِ, in
the Kur xliii. 35, thus read by some, means (assumed tropical:)  And
such as is blind to the admonition of the Compassionate, i. e., to the Kur-án; but مَنْ يَعْشُ, as others
read, (assumed tropical:)  such as feigns himself blind: (Ksh and
Bd: *) [see also 6: and see another explanation
of the latter reading, above: or] عَشَا signifies also
he (a man, TA) did as does the أَعْشَى [q. v.]. (K,
TA.) One says also, عشى مِنَ الشَّىْءِ, aor. يعشو,
[thus in my original, but the pret. is app. عَشِىَ,
and the aor. يَعْشَى,] meaning He lacked strength
of sight to perceive the thing. (TA.) And عَشِىَ
عَنْ حَقِّهِ like عَمِىَ in measure and in meaning
[i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, blind to his right, or
due]. (TA.) And لَا يَعْشَى إِلَّا بَعْدَ مَا يَعْشُو is one
of their sayings, meaning [app. He will not become
weak-sighted except] after his eating the [eveningmeal called the] عَشَآء: (TA:) [for it is said that]
the eating of food in the night occasions weakness
of sight more than [do] other things. (Har p. 52.
[العشآء is there written in one instance for العَشَا.])
―
-b6-  عَشِىَ عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. عَشًا, means He wronged him;
treated him wrongfully, injuriously, unjustly, or
tyrannically: (K, TA:) mentioned by ISd. (TA.)

عَشَّوَ see 1, former half, in two places. One says,
عَشِّ وَلَا تَغْتَرَّ, (Meyd, TA,) or عَشِّ إِبِلَكَ وَلَا تَغْتَرَّ
[a prov., meaning Pasture thy camels by night,
and be not negligent, or be not made to desire
what is vain, or false]. (S. [See Freytag's Arab.
Prov., ii. 92.]) And عَشَّيْتُ الإِبِلَ عَنِ الوِرْدِ I pastured the camels with the [evening-pasture called]
عَشَآء, so that they might come to the water having
satisfied themselves with food: and in like manner
one says, ضَحَّيْتُهَا عَنْهُ. (A and TA in art. ضحو
and ضحى.) And عَشِّ رُوَيْدًا Pasture thou the
camels in the evening (عَشِيًّا) gently: and in like
manner one says, ضَحِّ رُوَيْدًا. (A, TA.) And
hence, عشّى عَنِ الأَمْرِ (inf. n. تَعْشِيَةٌ, K) (tropical:)  He
acted gently, or deliberately, in the affair: (A
and TA in art. ضحو and ضحى, and S * and K *
in the present art.:) and in like manner, ضَحَّى
عَنْهُ. (A and TA in the former art., and S * in
the present art.)
-A2-  See also the next paragraph.
[Hence,] عشّى الطَّيْرَ, inf. n. تَعْشِيَةٌ, He kindled a
fire for the birds in order that they might become
dim-sighted (لِتَعْشَى) and consequently be captured.
(M, K.)

and in like manner one says ↓ عشّاهُ: see 2, last
sentence; and see also Har p. 52].
5
تَعَشَّوَ see 1, first quarter, in two places. One says
also, تعشّى بِهِ He fed himself with it [in the evening, or] in the time called the عِشَآء: and [in like
manner] تَتَعَشَّاهُ is said of camels [as meaning
they feed themselves with it, or pasture upon it,
in the evening]. (TA.) And when one says to
thee, تَعَشَّ [Eat thou the evening-meal], thou
sayest, مَا بِى تَعَشٍّ, (S,) or مَا بِى مِنْ تَعَشٍّ, (TA,)
[I have no desire for eating the evening-meal; see 5
in art. غدو;] and not مَا بِى عَشَآءٌ, (S,) or not ما
بي مِنْ عَشَآءٍ (TA.)
-A2-  See also 6.
-A3-  And تعشّاهُ
signifies also He gave him an عِشْوَة [or عُشْوَة, i. e.
a firebrand]. (TA.)
6
تعاشى He feigned himself أَعْشَى [i. e. weaksighted, &c.; and so ↓ تعشّى as used by Bd in xliii.
35]. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  And [hence] (tropical:)  He feigned himself ignorant, (K, TA,) عَنْ كَذَا [of such a thing],
as though he did not see it; like تَعَامَى. (TA.)
8
اعتشى He journeyed in the time of the عِشَآء
[or nightfall]: (K, TA:) like اهتجر meaning “ he
journeyed in the time of the هَاجِرَة. ” (TA.)

by means of a fire. (K.)

TA;) i. e. absolute destitution of sight. (TA.)
عَشٍ applied to a he-camel, and عَشِيَةٌ applied to
a she-camel, That exceeds the other camels in the
[evening-pasture, or evening-feed, called] عَشَآء;
each after the manner of the possessive epithet,
having no verb. (TA. [And عَشِىٌّ is said to have
a similar meaning.])
-A2-  See also أَعْشَى.
عَشْوَةٌ Darkness, (K, TA,) in [any part of] the
night and in the سَحَر [or period a little before daybreak]; (TA;) as also ↓ عَشْوَآءُ: (K:) or the first of
the darkness of the night: (Az, TA:) or the
period between the beginning and [the end of] the
[first] quarter of the night: (AZ, S, K:) thus in
the saying, مَضَى مِنَ اللَّيْلِ عَشْوَةٌ [A period between the beginning &c. of the night passed]: and
one says also, أَخَذْتُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِالعَشْوَةِ, meaning [I
laid hold upon them] in the blackness of night:
(AZ, S:) the dim. is ↓ عُشَيَّةٌ. (Az, TA.) In the
saying جَآءَ عَشْوَةَ, meaning عِشَآءً [i. e. He came at
nightfall], it [is an adv. n. which] may not be
used otherwise than thus: you may not say,
مَضَتْ عَشْوَةُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  العشوة [app. العَشْوَةُ] as
meaning العَشَآءُ, like الغدوة [app. الغَدْوَةُ] as meaning الغَدَآءُ, is vulgar. (TA.)
-A2-  Also The venturing upon, or embarking in, an affair that is
not clear; as also ↓ عِشْوَةٌ and ↓ عُشْوَةٌ: (S, K:)
one says, أَوْطَأْتَنِى عَشْوَةً and عِشْوَةً and عُشْوَةً,
meaning [Thou hast made me to venture upon, or
embark in,] a confused and dubious affair: this
is when you tell him of a thing by means of

عِشْوَةٌ: see عَشْوَةٌ:
-A2-  and see also عُشْوَةٌ.
عَشْوَى A state of perplexity, and of having little

عَشْيَانُ, (S, K, TA,) originally عَشْوَانُ, like
غَدْيَانُ [q. v.] which is originally غَدْوَانُ, (TA,)
A man (S) eating the [evening-meal, or eveningrepast, i. e. what is called the] عَشَآء; (S, K,
TA;) as also ↓ عَاشٍ. (TA.)
عَشَآءٌ The meal, or repast, (S, Msb, K,) of the
عِشَآء [or nightfall], (S, * Msb,) or of the عَشِىّ
[or late part of the evening, &c.]; (S, * K, TA;)
[i. e. supper, in a general sense;] opposed to
غَدَآءٌ; (S;) as also ↓ عِشْىٌ: (K: [in the CK,
العِشٰى is erroneously put for العِشْىُ:]) and in like
manner both are used in relation to camels [as
meaning their evening-pasture, or evening-feed:
see an ex. voce عَتَمَةٌ, and another voce أَقْعَسُ]:
(S, TA:) pl. of the former أَعْشِيَةٌ; (K, TA;) to
which is added, in [some of] the copies of the
K, and عُشِىٌّ; but this is correctly عَشِىَ, [or عَشَا,
as in some copies,] and commences another sentence. (TA.)
عِشَآءٌ [The time of nightfall; i. e.] the first, or
beginning, of the darkness (Msb, K) of night:
(Msb:) [this is the sense in which it is generally
used, and always when it is used as applied to
one of the five times of the divinely-appointed acts
of prayer; صَلَاةُ العِشَآءِ, and elliptically العِشَآءُ
alone, meaning the prayer of nightfall:] or it is
[the time] when the sun has disappeared: (Az,
TA:) or [the time] from sunset (K) [i. e.] from
the prayer of sunset (Msb, TA) to the عَتَمَة [or
darkness after nightfall]; (Msb, K, TA;) [and
this is what is meant by its being said that it is]
syn. with عَشِىٌّ: (S:) or [the time] from the زَوَال
[meaning the declining of the sun from the meridian] to the rising of the dawn: (S, K:) so
some assert, and they cite, as an ex.,
غَدَوْنَا غُدْوَةً سَحَرًا بِلَيْلٍ
عِشَآءً بَعْدَ مَا انْتَصَفَ النَّهَارُ
[We went early in the morning, a little before
daybreak, in a period between the declining of the
sun from the meridian and the rising of the dawn,
after the daytime had become halved]: (S, TA:)
[sometimes] the Arabs said, أَقْبَلَتِ العِشَآءُ, meaning العَشِيَّةُ; and هٰذَا العَشِيَّةُ, meaning العِشَآءُ.
(Msb voce صَوْتٌ.) العِشَاآنِ means The time of
sunset and the عَتَمَة [or darkness after nightfall]:
(IF, S, Msb, K: [compare
הָעַרְבַּיִ� in Exodus
xii. 6 and xvi. 12:]) this is accord. to the saying
that the عِشَآء is from the prayer of sunset to the
عَتَمَة. (TA.)
عَشَاوَةٌ: see عَشًا.
عَشِىٌّ [The late part of the evening: or the
evening: or the afternoon: i. e.] the last, or the
latter, part of the day; (Mgh, Msb, K, TA;)
as also ↓ عَشِيَّةٌ: (K, TA:) this is the meaning
commonly known: (Mgh:) or [the time] from
the prayer of sunset to the عَتَمَة [or darkness after
nightfall]; (S, Msb, TA;) like عِشَآءٌ; (Msb;)
and so ↓ عَشِيَّةٌ: you say, أَتَيْتُهُ عَشِىَّ أَمْسِ and
أَمْسِ ↓ عَشِيَّةَ [I came to him late in the evening,
or in the time between sunset and nightfall, &c.,
of yesterday]: (S, TA:) or عَشِىٌّ has the meaning
expl. in the K [and mentioned above]; but
↓ عَشِيَّةٌ relates to one day: and one says, جِئْتُهُ
عَشِيَّةً [I came to him late in an evening, &c.] and
عَشِيَّةَ [late this evening, &c.], and أَتَيْتُهُ العَشِيَّةَ I
came to him in the عشيّة [or late part of the
evening, &c.,] of this day; and آتِيهِ عَشِىَّ غَدٍ [I
will come to him in the late part of the evening,
&c., of to-morrow (in my original اتيته, an obvious mistranscription,)] without ة when relating
to the future; and أَتَيْتُكَ عَشِيًّا [I came to thee in
the late part of an evening, &c.]; and أَتَيْتُهُ بِالغَدَاةِ
وَالعَشِىِّ i. e. [I came to him early in the morning
and late in the evening, &c., meaning,] every
عَشِيَّة [or عَشِىّ] and غَدَاة: (TA:) or, as some
say, ↓ عَشِيَّةٌ is a sing. [or n. un.] and عَشِىٌّ is its
pl. [or a coll. gen. n.]: and, as IAmb says,
sometimes the Arabs make ↓ عَشِيَّةٌ masc., as
meaning عَشِىٌّ: (Msb:) or عَشِىٌّ signifies the
time between the declining of the sun [from the
meridian] and sunset: (Az, Mgh, Msb, TA:) or
[the time] from the declining of the sun [from the
meridian] to the صَبَاح [app. here, as generally,
meaning morning]: (Er-Rághib, Msb, TA:) and
sometimes it means the night: (TA:) the pl. is
عَشَايَا and عَشِيَّاتٌ, (K, TA,) the former of which
[is pl. of ↓ عَشِيَّةٌ, like the latter, or perhaps of
عَشِىٌّ also, and] is originally عَشَايِوُ, then عَشَايِىُ,
then عَشَائِىُ, then عَشَاءَى, and then عَشَايَا: (TA:)
the dim, of عَشِىٌّ is ↓ عُشَيَّانٌ, irreg., as though
formed from عَشْيَانٌ, and its pl. is عُشَيَّانَاتٌ; and
another form of its dim. is ↓ عُشَيْشِيَانٌ, pl.
عُشَيْشِيَانَاتٌ: and the dim. of ↓ عَشِيَّةٌ is ↓ عُشَيْشِيَةٌ,
pl. عُشَيْشِيَاتٌ: (S, TA:) one says, ↓ لَقِيتُهُ عُشَيْشَةً
[another form of dim., properly meaning I met
him in a short period of a late part of an evening,
&c.], and [in like manner] ↓ عُشَيْشَانًا, and ↓ عُشَيَّانًا
[in some copies of the K عشّانا], and ↓ عُشَيْشِيَةً
[accord. to the Mgh meaning عِشَآءً], and عُشَيْشَاتٍ,
and عُشَيْشِيَانَاتٍ. (K.) صَلَاتَا العَشِىِّ [The two
prayers of the afternoon] means the two prayers
of the ظُهْر and the عَصْر; (Az, Mgh, Msb, K;)
because they are in the latter part of the day
(فِى آخِرِ النَّهَارِ), after the زَوَال [or declining of
the sun from the meridian]. (TA.) In the phrase
أَوْضُحَاهَا ↓ عَشِيَّةً [i. e. A late part of an evening,
&c., or its early portion of the forenoon, meaning
or an early portion of the forenoon of the same
civil day], in the Kur lxxix. last verse, the ضحى
is prefixed to [the pronoun referring to] the
عشيّة because the ضحى and the عشيّة belong to
the same [civil] day, [for this day is reckoned as
the period from sunset to sunset,] (Ksh Bd, Jel, *)
and also [by a kind of poetic license, for the sake
of the rhyme, i. e.] because ضحاها occurs as a
فَاصِلَة [q. v.]. (Jel.) ―
-b2-  عَشِىٌّ also signifies, (K,
TA,) and so does ↓ عَشِيَّةٌ, (K,) Clouds (K, TA)
coming late in the evening or at eventide (عَشِيًّا).
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And the former, as an epithet applied
to a camel, That continues long eating the عَشَآء
[i. e. evening-pasture, or evening-feed]: fem. with ة.
(K. [See also عَشٍ.])

عُشَيْشِيَانَاتٌ: see عَشِىٌّ.
عَاشٍ: see عَشْيَانُ. The fem., عَاشِيَةٌ, applied to
camels, means Eating the [evening-pasture, or
evening-feed, called the] عَشَآء. (ISk, S, K.) It is
said in a prov., العَاشِيَةُ تَهِيجُ الآبِيَةَ [Such as are
eating the عشآء excite such as desire not, or refuse;
or she that is eating &c.]: i. e., when the camels
that desire not, or refuse, the عشآء see those that
are eating it, they follow them, and eat it with
them. (S. [See also Freytag's Arab. Prov.
ii. 83.]) And [the pl.] العَوَاشِى, (S, K, TA,)
[when indeterminate, عَوَاشٍ,] as an epithet in
which the quality of a subst. predominates, (TA.)
signifies Those (S, K, TA) camels, and sheep or
goats, (K, TA,) that are pasturing by night. (S,
K, TA.) ―
-b2-  See also 1, former half. ―
-b3-  [Hence,]
عَاشِيَةٌ signifies also Anything [meaning any man
or animal] looking and repairing, by night, towards the fire of a person who entertains guests.
(TA.)
أَعْشَى Weak-sighted: (Msb:) or sightless by
night, but seeing by day: (S:) or having bad
sight by night and by day: and so ↓ عَش: (K:)
fem. عَشْوَآءُ, (S, Msb, K,) applied to a woman;
(S, Msb;) [the masc. being applied to a man,
and either masc. or fem. to a beast of the equine
kind, and a camel, and a bird, (see عَشًا,)] and
dual masc. أَعْشَيَانِ (TA) and fem. عَشْوَاوَانِ: (S,
TA:) [and pl. عُشْىٌ.] ―
-b2-  The fem. عَشْوَآءُ also
particularly signifies. A she-camel that sees not
before her, (S, K, TA,) [or that has weak sight,]
and therefore strikes everything with her fore feet,
(S, TA,) not paying attention to the places of
her feet [on the ground]. (TA.) [Hence] one
says, رَكِبَ فُلَانٌ العَشْوَآءَ, meaning (tropical:)  Such a one
prosecuted his affair without mental perception, or
without certainty. (S, TA.) And خَبَطَهُ خَبْطَ
