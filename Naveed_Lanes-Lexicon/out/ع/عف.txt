عف1
عَفَّ, (S, O, Msb, K, &c.,) aor.
عَفِ3َ, (S, O,
Msb,) inf. n. عِفَّةٌ and عَفَافٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and
عَفٌّ and عَفَافَةٌ, (S, O, K,) He abstained (S, O,
Msb, K) from (عن) what was unlawful, (S, O,)
or from what was not lawful nor comely or decorous, (M, K,) or from things that should be
sacred or inviolable, and base, or carnal, objects
of inordinate desire, (TA,) or from a thing:
(Msb:) [but it is implied in the K that the verb is
used without the expression of the object, or objects; and it is very often so used, as meaning he
was abstinent, continent, chaste, virtuous, modest,
decent, or decorous:] and ↓ استعفّ signifies the
same; (K;) as also ↓ تعفّف: (Msb, K:) or this
last signifies, (S, O,) or signifies also, (K,) he affected, or constrained himself, to abstain from
what was unlawful: (S, O, K:) or he was
patient, and kept himself remote, or aloof, from a
thing [that was unlawful or the like]: (TA:)
and عَنِ المَسْأَلَةِ ↓ استعفّ means he abstained (عَفَّ)
from begging: (S, O:) whence the trad. of the
Prophet اِسْتَعْفِفْ عَنِ السُّؤَالِ مَا اسْتَطَعْتَ [Abstain
thou from begging, as much as thou art able]:
(O:) or, as some say, الاِسْتِعْفَافُ signifies the seeking to abstain from what is unlawful, and from
begging of men: and one says also, عَنِ ↓ اعتفّ
القَبِيحِ [he abstained from that which was evil, or
foul]; this being [likewise] from العِفَّةُ. (TA.)

عَفِ3َ, (IDrd, O, K,) inf. n.

-A2-  أَعَفَّتْ, [in
the CK, erroneously, اُعِفَّت,] said of a ewe, or
she-goat, is from العُفَافَةُ [and therefore signifies
She had milk collected in her udder: or she had
some milk remaining in her udder after most of
it had been sucked]. (IDrd, O, K.)

عَفِيفٌ and ↓ عَفٌّ epithets from عَفَّ, as such
signifying Abstaining (S, O, Msb, K) from what
is unlawful, (S, O,) or from what is not lawful
nor comely or decorous, (K,) or from things that
should be sacred or inviolable, and base, or carnal, objects of inordinate desire, (TA,) or from a
thing: (Msb:) [and very often used as meaning
abstinent, continent, chaste, virtuous, modest, decent,
or decorous:] fem. of the former with ة; (S, O, K;)
and so of ↓ the latter, (S, O, Msb, K,) which has
no broken pl.: (TA:) the pl. masc. (of عَفِيفٌ,
Msb, TA) is أَعِفَّآءُ (O, Msb, K, TA) and أَعِفَّةٌ:
(Msb, TA:) عَفِيفَةٌ, applied to a woman, signifies
excellent, or high-born, good, righteous, or virtuous; and [more commonly] continent, or chaste;
(TA;) and the pl. of this is عَفَائِفُ and عَفِيفَاتٌ.
(O, K.)
عُفَافَةٌ is the subst. from عَفَّ said of milk: (O,
K:) so says IDrd: (O:) [accord. to him, it app.
signifies Milk that has collected in the udder:]
and it signifies (S, O, K) accord. to another or
others, (O,) as also ↓ عُفَّةٌ, somewhat of milk remaining in the udder (S, O, K) after most of it
has been sucked. (O, K.) ―
-b2-  And F explains
العُفَافَةُ, with damm, by the words أَنْ تَأْخُذَ الشَّىْءِ
بَعْدَ الشَّىْءِ فَأَنْتَ تَعْتَفُّهُ [as though signifying The
taking thing after thing, by licking it up, or otherwise, from the ground, choosing the best thereof:
but this mode of explanation is often used in
lexicons to denote the thing, or things, mentioned
therein; not the act: and I think that what is
here meant is the thing, or things, thus taken:
this, moreover, is agreeable with the general
analogy of words of the measure فُعَالَةٌ; as is
shown by many exs. in the Mz, 40th نوع]. (TA.)
جَآءَ عَلَى عِفَّانِ ذٰلِكَ He (a man, S, O) came at
the time of that: (S, O, K: *) a dial. var. of
إِفَّان: (S, O:) or, accord. to IF, formed [from the
latter] by substitution. (O.)
