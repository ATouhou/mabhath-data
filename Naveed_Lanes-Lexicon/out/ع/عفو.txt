عفو1
عَفَا, aor. يَعْفُو, (S, Msb,) inf. n. عَفَآءٌ (S, Msb,
K) and عُفُوٌّ and عَفْوٌ, (Msb, K,) It was, or became,
effaced, erased, rased, or obliterated; (S, Msb, K;)
as also ↓ تعفّى: (K:) and it, or he, perished, came
to nought or to an end, or died. (S, TA.) One
says, عَفَا الأَثَرُ The trace, vestige, or footprint, was,
or became, effaced, &c. (TA.) And [hence,] عَفَا
أَثَرُهُ, inf. n. عَفَآءٌ, He perished, or died. (K.) And عَفَا
المَنْزِلُ, aor. as above. (S, Msb,) and so the inf. ns.
as in the first sentence, (Msb,) the place of alighting, or abode, was, or became effaced, &c., (S,
Msb:) and عَفَت الدَّارُ. aor. تعْفُو, inf. a عَفَآءٌ and
عُفُوٌّ [and عَفْوٌ]: (TA;) and ↓ تَعَفَّت, (S, TA.) and
↓ عَفَّت also; (TA;) The house, or dwelling, or
abode, was, or became, effaced, &c. (S, TA)
A'Obeyd cites, as an ex. of العَفَآءُ signifying the
being, or becoming, effaced, &c., and the perishing,
&c., the saying of Zuheyr, (S, TA.) mentioning
a dwelling, or an abode, (TA.)
تَحَمَّلُ أَهُلَهَا عَنْهَا فَبَانُوا
عَلَى آثَارِ مَا ذَهَبَ العَفَآءُ
[Its occupants departed from it, and separated
themselves, or removed far away; may the state
of that which is effaced, &c., be or rest, upon the
traces of what has gone away; or the meaning
may be, dust is upon the traces &c., (see عَفَآءٌ as
a subst., below;) but it is not thus accord to
A 'Obeyd; for] he says, This is like their saying
عَلَيْهِ الدَّبَارُ as an imprecation against one expressing a prayer that he may go away and not return.
(S, TA.) MF says that عَفَا is one of those verbs
that have contr. significations, for at signifies It
was, or became, unapparent, or imperceptible
and also It was, or became, apparent, or perceptible: and it has two other contr. significations, which will be mentioned in what follows
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And عَفْوٌ signifies also The act of
effacing, erasing, rasing, or obliterating. (K,
TA.) One says, عَفَتِ الرِّيحُ الأَثَرَ, (TA,) or
المَنْزِلَ, (S, Msb,) and الدَّارَ, (TA,) the wind
effaced, &c, (S, Msb, TA,) the trace, vestige, or
footprint, (TA,) or the place of alighting, or
abode, (S, Msb,) and the house, or dwelling, or
abode: (TA:) and in like manner, الرِّيحُ ↓ عَفَّتِ
الدَّارَ, (S, TA,) inf. n. تَعْفِيَةٌ, (TA,) in which the
verb is with teshdeed to denote intensiveness
[of the signification, i. e. the wind effaced, &c.,
mightily, or utterly, the house, or dwelling, or
abode]: (S, TA:) and عَلَى أَثَرِهِ ↓ عَفَّى It, or he,
effaced its, or his, trace, vestige, or footprint.
(MA.) ―
-b3-  Hence, as some say, عَفَا اللّٰهُ عَنْكَ i. e.
May God efface [from thee thy sin, &c.; meaning may God absolve thee]; (TA;) or may God
efface thy sins: (Msb:) [and عُفِىَ عَنْهُ May he
be absolved, or forgiven, or pardoned:] and hence
the saying in a trad., سَلُوا اللّٰهَ العَفْوَ i. e. [Ask ye
of God] the effacement of sin; [or ask ye of God
absolution, or forgiveness, or pardon;] and ↓ المُعَافَاةَ,
and ↓ العَافِيَةَ [which have a similar meaning:
see 3]: (TA:) and one says, عَفَوْتُ عَنْ ذَنْبِهِ,
meaning I left him, and did not punish him:
(S:) or عَفَوْتُ عَنْهُ and عَفَوْتُ عَنْ ذَنْبِهِ and عَفَوْتُ
لَهُ عَنْ ذَنْبِهِ i. e. I turned away from him, or from
his crime, sin, fault, or offence; syn. صَفَحْتُ عَنْهُ;
and I turned away (أَعْرَضْتُ) from punishing him:
(Mgh:) or العَفْوُ signifies the turning away (الصَّفْحُ,
K, TA) from the committer of a crime or the like;
(TA;) and the relinquishing the punishment of
the deserving [thereof]: and one says, عَفَا عَنْهُ
and عَفَا لَهُ ذَنْبَهُ and عَنْ ذَنْبِهِ [he turned away
from him, or from his crime, &c; and relinquished the infliction of his merited punishment,
i. e. forgave him, or pardoned him]: (K, TA:)
or عَفَا عَنْهُ ذَنْبَهُ and عَفَا لَهُ ذَنْبَهُ and عَنْ ذَنْبِهِ: (so
accord. to the CK:) accord. to MF, the primary
signification of العَفْوُ is التَّرْكُ: but this is not the
case: and الصَّفْحُ [by which it is expl. in the K]
is [or rather implies] the relinquishing of blame,
or reproof, or of severe, or angry, blame or
reproof; and this is more than [is signified by]
العَفْوُ, for the latter is sometimes without the
former: the primary signification of العَفْوُ [when
trans.] is [said to be] the purposing to take a
thing; and Er-Rághib says that عَفَوْتُ عَنْكَ is as
though it meant I have purposed to remove [or to
take away] thy crime or the like: (TA:) [but I
think that the primary signification of العَفْوُ when
its object is a crime or the like is that of effacement: and hence likewise what next follows:] ―
-b4-
العَفْوُ is also metaphorically used as meaning (tropical:)  The
withdrawing from a right, or due, and from seeking, or demanding, it: and thus the verb is used
in the Kur ii. 238 [q. v.]: and in the saying of
the Prophet, عَفَوْنَا لَكُمْ عَنْ صَدَقَةِ الخَيْلِ وَالرَّقِيقِ
[i. e. (tropical:)  We have remitted to you the poor-rate of
horses and of the slave or slaves]: (Mgh:) [and
hence] عَفَوْتُ عَنِ الحَقِّ means (assumed tropical:)  I have annulled
[or remitted] the right, or due; as though I erased
it from [the account of] him who owed it: (Msb:)
and عَفَوْتُ لَهُ عَنْ مَا لِى عَلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  I have relinquished
[or remitted] to him what was due to me on his
part. (TA.)
-A2-  عَفَا signifies also It was, or became, much in quantity, or many in number:
(Msb, MF, TA:) and also the contr., i. e. It
was, or became, little in quantity, or few in number. (MF, TA.) It is said in the former sense
of hair, and of herbage, &c.: (S:) or, said of
hair, It was, or became, long, and much in quantity; (TA;) and said of the hair of a camel, (K,)
or of the hair of a camel's back, (TA,) it became
abundant and long, and covered his rump; (K,
TA;) and said of herbage, it was, or became,

―
-b2-  And عَفَوْتُهُ I made it to become much in quantity, or many in number; as also ↓ أَعْفَيْتُهُ; (S, *
Msb, TA; *) and so ↓ عَفَّيْتُهُ. (TA.) Accord. to
Es-Sarakustee, one says, عَفَوْتُ الشَّعَرَ, aor. أَعْفُوهُ,
inf. n. عَفْوٌ; and عَفَيْتُهُ, aor. أَعْفِيهِ, inf. n. عَفَىٌ;
meaning I left the hair to become abundant and
long. (Msb.) And one says, اللِّحْيَةَ ↓ اعفى He
left the beard to become abundant and long, (Mgh,
K, TA,) having ceased from cutting it: (Mgh:)
whence, (TA,) it is said in a trad., أَمَرَ أَنْ تُحْفَى
الشَّوَارِبُ وَتُعْفَى اللُّحَى [He commanded that the
mustaches should be clipped closely, or much, and
that the beards should be left to become abundant
and long]: (S, TA:) or أَحْفُوا الشَّوَارِبَ وَأَعْفُوا
اللِّحَى [Clip ye &c.], and one may also use the
unaugmented verb [saying وَاعْفُوا, from عَفَا].
(Msb, TA.) And شَعَرَ البَعِيرِ ↓ أَعْفَيْتُ, (K,) or
شَعَرَ ظَهْرِ البَعِيرِ, (TA,) I left the hair of the camel,
or the hair of the back of the camel, to become
abundant and long; as also ↓ عَفَّيْتُهُ; (K, TA;)
this latter with teshdeed. (TA. [In the CK,
عَفَيْتُهُ.]) عَفَا الصُّوفَ, expl. in the K as signifying
He shore, or sheared, the wool, signifies he left
the wool to become abundant and long, then shore,
or sheared, it. (TA.)
-A3-  Also, inf. n. عَفْوٌ, i. q.
فَضَلَ or superfluous; or it remained over and above].
(Msb.) You say, خُذْ مَا صَفَا وَعَفَا, [correctly, مَا
عَفَا وَصَفَا,] meaning فَضَلَ وَتَسَهَّلَ [i. e. Take thou
what has exceeded, or become redundant, and has
become facilitated]. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  [And He exceeded.] You say, عَفَا عَلَيْهِ فِى العِلْمِ He exceeded
him in knowledge; syn. زَادَ. (K.) And هُوَ يَعْفُو
عَلَى مُنْيَةِ المُتَمَنِّى وَسُؤَالِ السَّائِلِ He exceeds, in
giving, the wish of the wisher and the petition of
the petitioner. (TA.) And عَفَوْتُ لَهُ بِمَالِى I
exceeded to him [what was incumbent on me] with
my property, and gave him. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And عَفَا,
aor. يَعْفُو, signifies also [simply] He gave. (TA.)
