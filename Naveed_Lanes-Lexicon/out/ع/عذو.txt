عذو1
عَذَا البَلَدُ, aor. يَعْذُو, The country, or town,
was good, or pleasant, in respect of its air. (IAar,
K, TA.) ―
-b2-  And you say, عَذُوَتِ الأَرْضُ (AZ, K,
TA) and عَذِيَت (K) أَحْسَنَ العَذَاةِ or العَذَآءَةِ. (So
accord. to different copies of the K [in which
what immediately precedes app. indicates that
the meaning is, The land was such as is termed
عَذَاة, in the best degree; so that العَذَاة or العَذَآءَة,
the former of which is the reading in the T, is
the inf. n.: but accord. to the TK, عَذُوَتِ الأَرْضُ,
having for its inf. n. عَذَاوَةٌ, and عَذِيَت, having
for its inf. n. عَذًى, mean, without any addition,
كَانَتْ أَحْسَنَ العَذَاةِ i. e. the land was the best of
what is termed عَذَاة].)
