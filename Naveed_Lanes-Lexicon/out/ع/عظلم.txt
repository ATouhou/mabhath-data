عظلمQ. 2
تَعَظْلَمَ, [from عِظْلِمٌ as signifying a certain plant or dye,] said of the night, It was, or
became, dark, and very black; (K, TA;) i. e. it
became like the عِظْلِم. (TA.)
عِظْلِمٌ, (S, Msb, K,) of which عَظْلَمٌ is a dial.
var., (MF, TA,) The expressed juice of a species
of tree or plant, (Az, K, TA,) the colour of which
is like نِيل [or indigo], green (أَخْضَر) inclining to
duskiness: (Az, TA:) or a certain plant, (S, K,)
or thing, (Msb,) with which one dyes, (S, Msb, K,)
said to be (Msb) called in Pers. نِيل [i. e. the
indigo-plant]: (Msb, and so in some copies of
the S; other copies of which, for نيل, have تفل:)
or i. q. وَسْمَةٌ [an appellation now applied to woad;
as is also عِظْلِم]: (S, Msb, K:) AHn says, one
of the Arabs of the desert told me that the عظلم
is the male وَسْمَة: he also says that it is a small
tree or plant, (شُجَيْرَةٌ), of the [class called] رِبَّة,
that grows in a late season, and the greenness of
which is lasting: and in one place he says, an
Arab of the desert, of the Saráh (السَّرَاة), told me
that the عِظْلِمَة [which is the n. un.] is a tree or
plant (شَجَرَةٌ) that rises upon a stem about a cubit
[in height] and has branches at the extremities of
which are what resemble the blossoms of the كُزْبَرَة
[or coriander], and it (the tree or plant) is dustcoloured: (TA:) some say that it is the بِقَّم [or
Brazil-wood]: (Msb:) MF says, it is the خَطْمِىّ
[or marsh-mallow]: (TA:) thus says El-Hareeree;
but El-'Okbaree says that it is not that: (Har
p. 625:) and some say that it is a certain red
dye. (TA.) Hence the prov.,
بَيْضَآءُ لَايُدْجِى سَنَاهَا العِظْلِمُ
i. e. [A white, or fair, female,] whose whiteness
[or brightness] عظلم will not blacken [or darken]:
applied to that which is notable, which nothing
will conceal. (Meyd, TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, as being
likened thereto, (S,) it signifies also The dark
night: (S, K:) one says لَيْلٌ عِظْلِمٌ. (TA.)
عَظْلَمَةٌ Darkness. (K.)
عِظْلَامٌ Dust; syn. قَتَرَةٌ and غَبَرَةٌ. (K.)
