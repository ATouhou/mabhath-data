عرفطعُرْفُطٌ [A species of mimosa; called by Forskål
mimosa örfota; (see his Flora Ægypt. Arab.,
pp. cxxiii. and 177;)] a sort of trees of the
[description termed] عِضَاه, (S, O, K,) which exudes
[the gum called] مُغْفُور, and of which the fruit
(بَرَمَة) is white and round: (S:) it has a gum of
disagreeable odour ; and when bees eat it, somewhat of its odour is found in their honey: (TA:)
AHn says that, accord. to Aboo-Ziyád, it is of
the عضاه, and spreads upon the ground, not rising
towards the sky, and has a broad leaf, and a
sharp, curved thorn; it is of those trees of which
the bark is stripped off and made into well-ropes;
(O, TA;) and there comes forth from its fruit
(بَرَم) what is termed عُلَّفَةٌ, [i. e. a pod,] resembling a bean, (O, * TA,) which is eaten by the
camels and the sheep or goats: (O:) it is said by
another, or others, that its fruit (بَرَمَة) is called
فَتْلَة, and is white, as though fringed with cotton;
(O, TA;) like the button of the shirt, or somewhat
larger: (O:) Aboo-Ziyád [further] says, (TA,)
it is compact in its branches; has no wood that is
useful like other wood; and has abundance of
gum, which sometimes drops upon the ground until
there are, beneath the trees, what resemble great
mill-stones: Sh says that it is a short tree, the
branches of which are near together, having many
thorns; its height is like that of a camel lying
down; it has a small, diminutive leaf; grows
upon the mountains; and the camels eat it, particularly desiring the upper extremities of its
branches: (O, TA:) [the word is a coll. gen. n.:]
the n. un. is with إِبِلٌ عُرْفُطِيَّةٌ. (O, K.)
عُرْفُط Camels that eat the [kind of trees
called] عُرْفُط. (TA.)
