were imagined to be made after it: or, accord. to
A'Obeyd, one says to her عَاجٍ, and جَاهٍ, with
tenween: [but see art. جوه:] accord. to AHeyth,
a word of this kind is originally mejzoom; but in
the case of a rhyme, [and in any case of poetical
necessity,] it may be makhfood. (TA.) [See also
art. عج.]
عَوَجٌ and ↓ عِوَجٌ [are inf. ns. of عَوِجَ, q. v., or the
latter is a simple subst.; and both, used as simple
substs.,] signify Crookedness, curvity, a bending, a
winding, wryness, contortion, distortion, or unevenness: (L:) or the former is peculiar to objects of
the sight, as bodies; and the latter, to what are not
seen, as opinion, and a saying, and religion: or,
as some say, the latter is used in both of these
cases; but the distinction is more common:
(IAth, TA:) AZ makes the same distinction;
but adds that some of the Arabs used the latter
word in relation to a road: (Msb:) accord. to
ISk, (S, O,) the former is in anything erect, (S,
O, K,) or in anything that was erect and has
inclined, (TA,) as a wall, (S, O, K, TA,) and a
stick, (S, O, Msb,) or a staff, (K, TA,) and a
spear; (TA;) and the latter, in land, or ground,

O, TA, [thus accord. to both of my copies of the
S,]) or عِوَجٌ, (accord. to a copy of the A, [which
I incline to regard as the right, in consideration
of its consistency with explanations here preceding, notwithstanding the apparent preponderance
of authority in favour of عَوَجٌ,]) in a man, signifies evilness of natural disposition: (S, A, O: [and
so, app., هَوَجٌ:]) or عَوَجٌ, with fet-h to the ع, as
an inf. n., signifies the being evil in natural disposition. (KL.)
عِوَجٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.

also,] crooked, curved, &c., of itself: fem. of the
former عَوْجَآءُ: (L, Msb:) and pl. عُوجٌ. (L.)
One says ↓ عَصًا مُعْوَجَّةٌ [A crooked, or crooking,
staff or stick]; but not مِعْوَجَّةٌ, with kesr to the
م: (S, O:) or, accord. to ISk, one says the former; but not ↓ مُعَوَّجَةٌ, with fet-h to the ع and
teshdeed to the و; though analogy does not forbid
this, as it is allowable to say عَوَّجَهَا: accord. to As,
one should not say ↓ مُعَوَّجٌ, with teshdeed to the
و, except in applying it to a stick, or in another
sense expl. below: Az says that this word is
allowable as signifying rendered crooked or curved
&c. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] العَوْجَآءُ signifies The
bow. (S, A, K.) ―
-b3-  And عَوْجَآءُ applied to a

see أَدْفَقُ.] ―
-b5-  نَخِيلٌ عُوجٌ signifies Palm-trees
inclining, or leaning, and therefore crooked, or
curved: and accord. to some, the saying of
Lebeed, describing a [wild] he-ass and his she-asses,
وَأَوْرَدَهَا عَلَى عُوجٍ طِوَالِ
[the latter hemistich of a verse cited in the first
paragraph of art. حوذ] means, And he brought
them to the watering-place at [tall] palm-trees
growing over the water, inclining and curving by
reason of the abundance of their fruit: but others
say that the meaning of على عوج is, upon their
crooked legs. (TA.) ―
-b6-  Hence, عُوجٌ signifies The
legs of a horse or similar beast; (O, TA;) as ISd
says, thus used as an epithet in which the quality
of a subst. predominates [app. implying their
having that bending, or curving, and tension of
the sinews, termed تَجْنِيب, agreeably with what
here follows]. (TA.) ―
-b7-  And hence also, (TA,)

legs, the quality termed تَجْنِيب. (A, TA. *) ―

kind. (A.) ―
-b10-  الأَيَّامُ عُوجٌ رَوَاجِعُ [The days are
apt to decline from the right course, apt to return,]
is a prov., (Meyd, O, TA,) meaning fortune at
one time declines from thee, and at another time
returns to thee; (Meyd;) said by him at whose
affliction one rejoices, or said on his part, and
sometimes on an occasion of threatening: Az
says that عُوجٌ, here, may be pl. of أَعْوَجُ, or of
عَوْجَآءُ; or it may be pl. of ↓ عَائِجٌ, and originally
عُوُجٌ. (O, TA.) [Hence,] العُوجُ is used as signifying The days [in allusion to their variableness
with respect to good and evil]. (TA.) ―

الأَعْوَجِيَّاتُ, (TA,) an appellation of certain horse
so called in relation to one named أَعْوَجُ, belonging
to the Benoo-Hilál, (S, O, K,) a stallion than
which there was none more celebrated among the
Arabs, nor any that had a more numerous progeny: (S, O:) they were also called الخَيْلُ
الأَعْوَجِيَّةُ, (L,) and ↓ بَنَاتُ أَعْوَجَ, (S, O,) and بَنَاتُ
↓ عُوجٍ; and a poet says,

[Brown, or a blackish bay, of the progeny of
Aawaj, hard in the hoof]; meaning مِنْ وَلَدِ
↓ أَعْوَجَ; using that form of pl. because أَعْوَجُ is
originally an epithet. (TA.)
مَعَاجٌ A place to which one turns; or in which
one remains, stays, dwells, or abides. (Har p. 325.)
