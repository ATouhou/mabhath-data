اعتزى إِلَيْهِ (S, Mgh, * Msb, K) and لَهُ (K)
He asserted his [own] relationship [of son] to him:
(S, Mgh, * Msb, K:) [you say, اعتزى إِلَى فُلَانٍ
and لِفُلَانٍ He asserted his relationship of son to
such a one:] and so ↓ تعزّى, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,)
and ↓ عَزَا. (K.) It is said in a trad., ↓ مَنْ تَعَزَّى
الجَاهِلِيَّةِ فَأَعِضُّوهُ بِهَنِ أَبِيهِ وَلَا تَكْنُوا ↓ بِعَزَآءِ [expl. in
art. عض: see 4 in that art.]. (S, Mgh, Msb.)
See also art. عزى.
عِزَةٌ A party of men (S, Msb, K) such as is
termed عُصْبَةٌ [i. e., as expl. in the O in art. عصب,
who league together to defend one another], (K,
TA,) above, or exceeding, [such as compose] a
حَلْقَة: (TA:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib, a company of men who assert their relationship, one to
another, either by birth or by the leaguing together
for mutual aid: (TA:) [for] the ة is a substitute
for the final radical letter which is و: (Msb:) or,
as some say, it is from عَزَى signifying “ he was,
or became, patient; ” as though they were a
company who took patience by one another's example: (TA:) [for, accord. to J,] the ة is a substitute for ى: (S:) the pl. is عِزُونَ (S, Msb, K)
and عُزُونَ and عِزًى, but they did not say عِزَاتٌ:
(S:) hence عِزِينَ in the Kur lxx. 37, (S, TA,)
[expl. as] meaning companies in a state of dispersion: (TA:) or separate, or sundry, parties:
pl. of عِزَةٌ, which is [said to be] originally عِزْوَةٌ,
from [the inf. n.] العَزْوُ: as though each party
asserted their relationship [as sons] to other than
those to whom the other party asserted their relationship: (Ksh, Bd:) عِزُونَ is expl. by Et-Tarasoosee as meaning companies coming in a state of
dispersion. (Msb.) One says, فِى الدَّارِ عِزُونَ,
meaning [In the house, or abode, are] several sorts
of men. (As, S.)
عِزْوَةٌ: see عَزَآءٌ, below, in two places:
-A2-  and
also in art. عزى.
عَزْوَى, which is of the dial. of the tribe of
Mahrah Ibn-Heydán, but disapproved, (IDrd,
TA,) is a word expressive of desire for one's becoming favourably inclined; [as though meaning
Mercy on me! or I cry mercy;] and so ↓ تَعْزَى:
(K, TA:) or a word expressive of the being, or
becoming, favourably inclined; [as though meaning Mercy on thee!] and so ↓ يَعْزَى, (IDrd, TA,)
which is of the dial. of the people of Esh-Shihr,
a bad word: (TA in art. عزى:) مَا كَانَ ↓ يَعْزَى
كَذَا, (K and TA in that art, in the CK يَعزِى,)
a saying of that people, (TA,) [app. meaning
Mercy on thee! (or the like) it was not thus, or
such a thing was not,] is like the saying لَعَمْرِى
لَقَدْ كَانَ كَذَا [“ By my life,” or “ by my religion,” &c.]. (K, TA.)
بَنُو عَزْوَانَ A certain tribe of the Jinn, or Genii.

or تَعَزَّى; (S, Mgh, TA; see an ex. above, voce
