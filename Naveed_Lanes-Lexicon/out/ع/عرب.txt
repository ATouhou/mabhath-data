man's saying to another, If I do not purchase
this for so much, thou shalt have such and such
of my property. (O, TA.)
3
عَاْرَبَ [The following ex. is given of the inf. n. of
this verb.] One says, مَا أُوتِىَ أَحَدٌ مِنْ مُعَارَبَةِ

اعرب, (AZ, Msb, TA,) [for اعرب الكَلَامَ,
like افصح for افصح الكَلَامَ,] inf. n. إِعْرَابٌ, (A,
K,) He spoke clearly, plainly, distinctly, or intel-ligibly, (AZ, A, Msb, K, * TA,) in Arabic;
(Msb;) as also ↓ تعرّب, and ↓ استعرب; said of

distinct, or intelligible, in speech: (AZ, Msb,
TA:) and ↓ عَرُبَ, aor.
عَرُبَ, inf. n. عُرْبٌ and عُرُوبٌ,
accord. to Th, and عُرْبَةٌ and عِرَابَةٌ [which accord.
to general analogy would be عَرَابَةٌ] and عُرُوبِيَّةٌ;
(TA;) or ↓ عَرِبَ, aor.
عَرَبَ; (Msb;) [likewise] signifies he spoke clearly, plainly, or distinctly, after
being barbarous, or vitious, in speech: (Msb,
TA:) and ↓ عَرُبَ he spoke without incorrectness;
(Msb;) and [so اعرب, for] إِعْرَابٌ signifies the
committing no error in speech: (K, TA:) and
the expressing of meanings clearly, plainly, distinctly, or perspicuously, by words. (TA.) [↓ عرّب,
also, has a similar meaning:] it is said in a trad.,
أَنْ ↓ كَانُوا يَسْتَحِبُّونَ أَنْ يُلَقِّنُوا الصَّبِىَّ حِينَ يُعَرِّبُ
يَقُولَ لَا إِلَاهَ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ سَبْعَ مَرَّاتٍ (O, TA) i. e. [They

the speech [that he spoke] clear, plain, distinct,
or perspicuous. (TA.) And اعرب بِحُجَّتِهِ He
declared, or spoke out clearly or plainly, his argument, plea, allegation, or the like, without fearing
any one. (S, O.) And أَعْرَبْتُ الشَّىْءَ and اعربت
عَنْهُ, and ↓ عَرَّبْتُهُ and عرّبت عَنْهُ, which last, accord. to Fr, is better than عرّبتهُ and اعربتهُ, I
made the thing clear, plain, distinct, or manifest.
(Msb.) And اعرب عَمَّا فِى ضَمِيرِهِ He declared,
or spoke out clearly or plainly, what was in his
mind. (TA.) And اعرب عَنْهُ لِسَانُهُ, and ↓ عرّب
عنه, His tongue made clear, or plain, or spoke
clearly, or plainly, for him: and عَمَّا فِى ↓ يُعَرِّبُ
قَلْبِهِ لِسَانُهُ His tongue tells plainly, or declares,
what is in his heart. (Az, TA.) It is said in a
trad., الثَّيِّبُ تُعْرِبُ عَنْ نَفْسِهَا, (S,) or الأَيِّمُ, and
↓ تُعَرِّبُ, accord. to different relaters, but some
say the former only, (Msb,) i. e. [She who has
become a widow, or been divorced, &c., or she who
has no husband, whether she be a virgin or not, or
not being a virgin,] shall speak out plainly for
herself [when demanded in marriage]: (S, Msb:)
or الثَّيِّبُ يُعْرِبُ عَنْهَا لِسَانُهَا, so accord. to IKt, (O,)
or عنها ↓ يُعَرِّبُ, (Mgh, O,) so accord. to A 'Obeyd,
but, as IAmb says, both are dial. vars. of which
neither is preferable to the other; and the meaning is [she who has become a widow, &c., her
tongue] shall declare for her. (O.) One says
also, اعرب عَنِ الرَّجُلِ He spoke out, or explained,
for the man. (TA.) And عَنِ القَوْمِ ↓ عَرَّبْتُ I
spoke for the people, or party; (Fr, S, Mgh, * O,
K;) and pleaded for them; (Fr, Mgh, * TA;)
as also أَعْرَبْتُ; but the former in this sense is
better known. (Mgh.) And اعرب عَنْهُ, and
عنه ↓ عرّب, He pleaded his cause. (TA.) And
عَنْ حَاجَتِهِ ↓ عرّب He spoke and pleaded for the
object of his want. (A.) ―
-b2-  اعرب also signifies
He was, or became, chaste, uncorrupt, or free
from barbarousness, in speech; although not an
Arab. (Msb.) And لَهُ الكَلَامَ ↓ عَرَّبْتُ, inf. n.
تَعْرِيبٌ; as also أَعْرَبْتُ له, inf. n. إِعْرَابٌ; I made
the speech [that I spoke] clear, or plain, to him,
so that there was in it no barbarousness. (TA.)
And مَنْطِقَهُ ↓ عرّب, (S, O,) inf. n. تَعْرِيبٌ, (K,)
He made his speech free from error, or incorrectness. (S, O, K.) And أَعْرَبْتُ الحَرْفَ I made the
حرف [i. e. word] clear, or plain: or the ا in this
case denotes privation, and the meaning is (assumed tropical:)  I
removed its عرب, [app. ↓ عَرَب, from this word as
inf. n. of عَرِبَ used in relation to the stomach &c.,]
i. e. vagueness. (Msb.) And اعرب كَلَامَهُ He
made his speech free from error, or incorrectness,
in [what is termed] الإِعْرَاب [here meaning what
grammarians generally intend thereby, namely,
desinential syntax, or the science of the various
inflections of words, literal or virtual, by reason
of the various governing words]. (S, O.) [اعرب
is also used by grammarians as meaning He declined a word; and أُعْرِبَ as meaning It was
declined, or declinable; in these senses opposed
to بَنَى and بُنِىَ, inf. n. بِنَآءٌ: and the former also
as meaning He analyzed grammatically, or
parsed, a sentence: and the inf. n. of the verb
(act. and pass.) in these senses is إِعْرَابٌ.] ―
-b3-
See also 2, first sentence: ―
-b4-  and again in the
first third part of the paragraph. ―
-b5-  إِعْرَابٌ also
signifies The making [a person] to revert from,
or relinquish, foul speech; (K, TA;) and so
↓ تَعْرِيبٌ. (TA.) ―
-b6-  And The speaking foul, or
obscene, language; as also ↓ تَعْرِيبٌ, and ↓ اِسْتِعْرَابٌ:
(O, K:) thus it bears two contr. significations.
(K, TA.) One says of a man, اعرب [&c.], (S,
O,) or اعرب فِى كَلَامِهِ, (Msb,) He spoke foul,
or obscene, language. (S, O, Msb.) [Golius and
Freytag have assigned this meaning to ↓ تعرّب
also: the latter of them as from the S and K;
in neither of which do I find it.] ―
-b7-  And The
act of copulating: or the speaking of that act in
an oblique, or indirect, manner. (K.)
-A2-  And
اعرب, (S, O,) inf. n. إِعْرَابٌ, (K,) He had a child
born to him of Arabian complexion, or colour.
(S, O, K.) ―
-b2-  And He possessed, or acquired,
or sought to acquire, horses, or camels, of pure
Arabian race. (TA. [See also 2, in the middle
of the latter half; and see مُعْرِبٌ.]) ―
-b3-  And إِعْرَابٌ
signifies One's knowing a horse of pure Arabian
race from one of mean race by his neighing. (K.)
And A horse's being known by his neighing to be
of pure Arabian race, free from any admixture
of other than Arabian blood: (K, TA:) [or his
making himself to be known as such by his neighing; for] اعرب means he (a horse) neighed, and
was consequently known to be of Arabian race.
(A.) ―
-b4-  And The making a horse to run. (K.)
Accord. to Fr, one says, اعرب عَلَى فَرَسِهِ, meaning
He made his horse to run: but he adds that some
say اغرب. (O.)
-A3-  And إِعْرَابٌ signifies The
taking as one's wife a woman such as is termed
عَرُوبٌ [q. v.]. (K.)
-A4-  اعرب سَقْىُ القَوْمِ means
The people's watering [of their camels], having
been at one time on alternate days, and another
time on the fourth day after that of the next preceding watering, then became, and continued to be,
of one uniform way. (S, O.)
-A5-  See also 2, last
four sentences.
5
تعرّب He assimilated himself to the Arabs.
(S.) He (a man not of genuine Arabian descent)
introduced himself among the Arabs, and spoke
their language, and imitated their manner or
appearance; [he became a naturalized, or an
insitious, Arab; (see العَرَبُ;)] as also ↓ استعرب.
(Az, TA.) ―
-b2-  He became an Arab of the desert;
(S, Mgh;) he returned to the desert, (Az, Mgh,
TA,) after he had been dwelling in a region of
cities or towns or villages and of cultivated land,
and joined himself to the Arabs of the desert.
(Az, TA.) Hence, تعرّب بَعْدَ هِجْرَتِهِ He became
an Arab of the desert [after his flight, or emigration, for the sake of El-Islám], (S, Mgh,) returning to the desert. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  He dwelt, or abode,
in the desert. (O, K.) ―
-b4-  See also 4, first sentence. ―
-b5-  تَعَرَّبَتْ لِزَوْجِهَا She acted in an amorous
manner, or with amorous dalliance, and mani-
fested love, to her husband. (A, TA.) ―
-b6-  Respecting a meaning assigned to تعرّب by Golius and
Freytag, see 4, latter half.
10
استعرب: see 5: ―
-b2-  see also 4, first sentence: ―
-b3-  and the same again in the latter half
of the paragraph.
-A2-  استعرب جَرَبًا, said of a
camel, He was affected with mange, or scab,
which began in his armpits and groins or similar
parts, and his lips, and appeared upon the general
extent of his skin. (O.) ―
-b2-  And استعربت, said
of a cow, She desired the bull. (O, K.)
Q. Q. 1
عَرْبَنَ: see 2, near the end.
عَرْبٌ is syn. with إِعْرَابٌ in the sense of إِفْصَاحٌ
[but app. as a subst. (not an inf. n.) meaning
Clear, plain, or distinct, speech]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
syn. with عِرَابَةٌ, q. v. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And syn. with
عَرَبٌ as [inf. n. of عَرِبَ, and] meaning نَشَاطٌ [i. e.
Briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness]. (O, K.)
العُرْبُ: see العَرَبُ, first sentence.
عِرْبٌ Such as is dried up, of the [species of
barley-grass called] بُهْمَى: (S, O, K:) or of any
herb, or leguminous plant: n. un. with ة: or
عِرْبُ البُهْمَى signifies the prickles of the بُهْمَى.
(TA.)
العَرَبُ, (S, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K, &c.,) as also
↓ العُرْبُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) A certain people, or
nation; [the Arabs, or Arabians;] (S, O;) the
contr. of العَجَمُ (A, Msb, K, TA) and العُجْمُ;
(TA;) the inhabitants of the cities, or large
towns, (S, A, O, K,) or of the Arabian cities
and towns or villages: (Mgh:) [but now, on the
contrary, generally applied to those who dwell in
the desert:] or those who have alighted and made
their abode in the cultivated regions, and have
taken as their homes the Arabian cities and
towns or villages, and others also that are related
to them: (Az, Msb:) or [accord. to general
usage] an appellation of common application [to
the whole nation]: (T, K:) [and in the lexicons
and lexicological works applied to the desert
Arabs of pure speech:] it is of the fem. gender:
(Msb, K:) and العَرَبُ has two pls., namely,
العُرُبُ, with two dammehs, and الأَعْرُبُ [which is
a pl. of pauc.]: (Msb:) the rel. n. [which serves
as a sing.] is ↓ عَرَبِىٌّ: (S, O, K: [عَرَبٌ عَرَبِىٌّ in
the CK is a mistake:]) accord. to Az, (TA,)
this appellation is applied to a man of established
Arab lineage, even if he be not chaste, or correct,
in speech. (Msb, TA.) The dim. of العَرَبُ is
↓ العُرَيْبُ, (S, O,) without ة, (O, TA,) an extr.
word [with respect to analogy, as the undiminished
noun is fem.]: (TA:) a poet (Abu-l-Hindee,
whose name was 'Abd-El-Mu-min, son of 'AbdEl-Kuddoos, O, TA) says,
وَمَكْنُ الضِّبَابِ طَعَامُ العُرَيْبِ
وَلَا تَشْتَهِيهِ نُفُوسُ العَجَمْ
[And the eggs of dabbs are food of the little
Arabs; but the souls of the Foreigners do not
desire them]: in which he uses the dim. form to
imply respect, or honour, like as it is used in the
saying أَنَا جُذَيْلُهَا المُحَكَّكُ وَعُذَيْقُهَا المُرَجَّبُ [expl.
in art. جذل]. (S, O.) ―
-b2-  ↓ العَرَبُ العَارِبَةُ (in which
the latter word is used as a corroborative of the
former as in لَيْلٌ لَائِلٌ, S, O) and ↓ العَرَبُ العَرْبَآءُ
(S, A, O, Msb, K) and ↓ العَرَبُ العَرَبِيَّةُ (O) and
↓ العَرَبُ العَرِبَةُ (K) and ↓ العَرَبُ العَرِبَاتُ (CK [but
this I do not find in any other copy of the K])
are appellations of The pure, or genuine Arabs:
(S, A, O, K:) or those who spoke the language of
Yaarub Ibn-Kahtán; which is the ancient language: (Msb:) and ↓ العَرَبُ المُسْتَعْرِبَةُ, (S, O,
Msb, K,) as also ↓ العَرَبُ المُتَعَرِّبَةُ, (S, O, K,) is
an appellation of The insititious [or naturalized
Arabs]; (K;) those who are not pure, or genuine,
Arabs: (S, O:) or those who spoke the language
of Ismá'eel [or Ishmael] the son of Ibráheem [or
Abraham], i. e., the dialects of El-Hijáz and the
parts adjacent thereto: (Msb:) and the appellation of ↓ مُسْتَعْرِبَةٌ is thought by Az to apply [also]
to people not of pure Arabian descent, who have
introduced themselves among the Arabs, and speak
their language, and imitate their manner or
appearance. (TA.) [The former division is
most reasonably considered as consisting of the
extinct tribes ('Ád, Thamood, and others mentioned in what follows); or of these together
with the unmixed descendants of Kahtán, whose
claims to the appellation of genuine Arabs are
held by many to be equally valid: and the latter
division, as consisting of those whose origin is
referred, through Ma'add and 'Adnán, to Ismá'eel
(or Ishmael), whose wife was descended from
Kahtán. What I find in the TA, on this subject, is as follows.] The former of these two
divisions consisted of nine tribes, descendants of
Irem [or Aram] the son of Sám [or Shem] the
son of Nooh [or Noah]; namely, 'Ád, Thamood,
Umeiyim, 'Abeel, Tasm, Jedees, 'Imleek [or
Amalek], Jurhum, and Webári; and from them
Ismá'eel [or Ishmael is said to have] learned the
Arabic language: and the ↓ مُتَعَرِّبَة are [said to be]
the descendants of Ismá'eel, the descendants of
Ma'add the son of 'Adnán the son of Udd: so
says Abu-l-Khattáb Ibn-Dihyeh, surnamed Dhun-Nesebeyn: or the former division consisted of
seven tribes, namely, 'Ád, Thamood, 'Imleek,
Tasm, Jedees, Umeiyim, and Jásim; the main
portion of whom has become extinct, some remains of them, only, being scattered among the
[existing] tribes: so says IDrd: and the appellation of ↓ العَرَبُ العَارِبَةُ is also given to the descendants of Yaarub the son of Kahtán [only]. (TA.)
[It should be observed, however, that the appellation of ↓ المُتَعَرِّبَةُ is, by those who hold the extinct
tribes above mentioned as the only genuine Arabs,
applied to the unmixed descendants of Kahtán;
and ↓ المُسْتَعْرِبَةُ, to those who are held to be the
descendants of Ismá'eel: thus in the Mz, 1st نوع.
Also, it should be observed that the appellation of
↓ العَرَبُ العَارِبِةُ, in the conventional language of
Arabic lexicology, is often applied to the Arabs
of the classical ages, and the later Arabs of the
desert who retained the pure language of their
ancestors, indiscriminately: it is thus applied by
writers quoted in the Mz (1st نوع) to all the
descendants of Kahtán, and those of Ma'add the
son of 'Adnán (through whom all the descendants
of Ismá'eel trace their ancestry) who lived before
the corruption, among them, of the Arabic language.] ―
-b3-  ↓ الأَعْرَابُ is the appellation given to
Those [Arabs] who dwell in the desert; (S, Mgh,
O, Msb, K;) such as go about in search of herbage and water; and Az adds, whether of the Arabs
or of their freedmen: he says that it is applied
to those who alight and abide in the desert, and
are neighbours of the dwellers in the desert, and
journey, or migrate, with them, to seek after herbage and water: (Msb:) it is not a pl. of العَرَبُ,
not being like الأَنْبَاطُ, which is pl. of النَّبَطُ; (S,
O;) but is a [coll.] gen. n.: (S:) الأَعَارِيبُ occurs
as its pl. (S, O, K) in chaste poetry: (S:) it has
no sing. [properly so termed]: (K:) the rel. n. is
↓ أَعْرَابِىٌّ, (S, O,) which is applied to single person; (Msb;) as also بَدَوِىٌّ: (TA:) Az says, if
one say to an أَعْرَابِىّ, يَا عَرَبِىُّ, he is pleased; and
if one say to an عَرَبِىّ, يَا أَعْرَابِىُّ, he is angry.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  Authors differ as to the cause why the
عَرَب were thus called: some say, because of the
perspicuity of their speech, from إِعْرَابٌ: others,
that they were so called from Yaarub the son of
Kahtán, who is said to have been the first that
spoke the Arabic language; his original language
having been, as asserted by IDrd, [what the
Arabs term] Syriac; though some say that
Ismá'eel was the first that spoke the Arabic
language; and some, that Yaarub was the first
that spoke Arabic, and that Ismá'eel was the
first that spoke the pure Arabic of El-Hijáz, in
which the Kur-án was revealed: others say that
the عَرَب were so called from العَرَبَةُ, the name of a
tract near El-Medeeneh, or a name of Mekkeh
and the adjacent region, where Ismá'eel settled,
or the same as Tihámeh [as is said in the Mgh,
in which this is pronounced to be the most correct
derivation], or the general name of the peninsula
of Arabia, which is also called العَرَبَاتُ [as is said
in the Msb]: but some say that they were so
called in like manner as were the فُرْس and the
رُوم and the تُرْك and others, not after the name
of a land or other than a land, but by the coining
of the name, not a term expressive of a quality or
a state or condition &c. (TA.) [If the country
were called العَرَبَةُ, an inhabitant thereof might be
called, agreeably with analogy, عَرَبِىٌّ; and then,
the people collectively, العَرَبُ: but I think that
the most probable derivation is from the old
Hebrew word
עְרֶב, meaning “ a mixed people,”
which the Arabs assert themselves to have been,
almost from the first; and in favour of this derivation it may be reasonably urged that the old
Himyeritic language agrees more in its vocabulary
with the Hebrew and Phœnician than it does with
the classical and modern Arabic.]

-A3-  And see عَرِبٌ.
-A4-  [It also app. signifies

-A2-  And i. q. نَفْسٌ
[The soul, mind, or self]. (S, O, K.) [It is
thought to occur in a pl. sense, without ة, as
a coll. gen. n., in the following sense, quoted in
the S immediately after the explanation above.]
A poet says, (S,) namely, Ibn-Meiyádeh, (O,)
لَمَّا أَتَيْتُكَ أَرْجُو فَضْلَ نَائِلِكُمْ
↓ نَفَحْتَنِى نَفَحَةً طَابَتْ لَهَا العَرَبُ
[When I came to thee, hoping for the redundance
of your bounty, thou gavest me a gift with which
the souls were pleased]: (S, O:) thus related by
some, and expl. as meaning طَابَتْ لَهَا النُّفُوسُ:
but the [approved] relation is, طَارَتْ بِهَا العَرَبُ
[(assumed tropical:)  which the Arabs made to fly upon the wings
of fame], i. e. حَدَّثَتِ العَرَبُ النَّاسَ بِهَا [meaning
(assumed tropical:)  of which the Arabs talked to the people]. (O.)

(TA,) means Engrave not on your signets مُحَمَّدٌ
رَسُولُ اللّٰهِ; (Mgh, O, K, TA;) because this was
engraved on the Prophet's own signet: (O, TA:)
as though he had said, نَبِيًّا عَرَبِيًّا [an Arabian prophet]; meaning himself. (O, K, TA.) Omar
said, ↓ لَا تَنْقُشُوا فِى خَوَاتِيمِكُمُ العَرَبِيَّةَ [Engrave
not on your signets Arabic]: and Ibn-'Omar disapproved of engraving on a signet words from
the Kur-án. (Mgh, * O, TA.) [عَرَبِىُّ الوَجْهِ often

'Irak, and it is the best of barley. (TA.)

what was most excellent in the dialects of the
Arabs, [in the doing of which they were aided
by the confluence of pilgrims from all parts of
the country,] so that their dialect became the
most excellent of all, and the Kur-án was therefore revealed in that dialect. (TA.) See also
عَرَبِىٌّ, in two places. ―
-b2-  And see عُرُوبَةٌ.
عَرْبَانُ [written in the TA without any syll.

K) and ↓ عُرُبَّانٌ, mentioned on the authority of

(Mgh, O, Msb) or hire (Msb) have effect, it
shall be reckoned as part of the price, and otherwise shall not be reclaimed; (Mgh, O, Msb;)
called by the vulgar رَبُون: (O:) it is forbidden
in a trad., (Mgh, O, TA,) and by most of the
lawyers, but allowed by some: (TA:) عربون is
said by As to be a foreign word arabicized,
(Msb,) and so say many authors; though it is
said by some of the expositors of the Fs to be
from التَّعْرِيبُ signifying “ the making clear,
plain,” &c.; اربون being also derived from أُرْبَةٌ
signifying “ a knot: ” (TA:) and [it is said that]
the ن in عربون and عربان may be augmentative
or radical, because one says أَعْرَبَ فِى كَذَا and
عَرْبَنَ. (O.) ―

his excrement, or ordure. (O, K, TA.)

and] it [the fruit] is eaten by the apes, or monkeys,
and sometimes, in a case of hunger, by men: n. un.
with ة. (O, TA.)
خَيْلٌ عِرَابٌ Horses of pure Arabian race;
(Mgh, K;) opposed to بَرَاذِينُ; (S, O, Msb;)
also termed ↓ أَعْرُبٌ and ↓ مُعْرِبَةٌ, (K,) which last
[erroneously written in the CK مَعْرِبَةٌ] is fem. of
مُعْرِبٌ, signifying a horse having no strain of
admixture of other than Arabian blood: (Ks,

having two contr. meanings; [the latter meaning]
from عَرْب [a mistranscription for عَرَب] signifying
“ corruptness ” of the stomach: (O:) or who loves
him passionately, or excessively: or who manifests
love to him, evincing passionate, or excessive, desire:
[lit., evincing that; meaning what is expressed
by the words immediately preceding it; for
otherwise this last explanation would be the
same as the first; and as I have rendered it,
it is nearly the same as an explanation in the
Expos. of the Jel (lvi. 36), manifesting love to
her husband, by reason of passionate, or excessive,
desire:] (K:) and (so in the TA, but in the CK
“ or ”) a woman who is a great laugher: and
↓ عَرُوبَةٌ and ↓ عَرِبَةٌ signify the same: (K:) the
pl. of the first is عُرُبٌ (S, O, K) and عُرْبٌ; (TA;)
and the pl. of ↓ عَرِبَةٌ is عَرِبَاتٌ: (K:) IAth says
that ↓ عَرِبَةٌ signifies a woman who is eager for
play, or sport: and عُرُبٌ, he adds, is pl. of
↓ عَرِيبٌ, which signifies a woman of goodly person, who manifests love to her husband: and it is
also said that عُرُبٌ signifies women who use
amorous gesture or behaviour, and coquettish boldness, with feigned coyness or opposition: or who

it is thought to be not Arabic; (TA;) and said
to be arabicized from the Nabathæan أَرُبَا: (Har
p. 340, q. v.:) accord. to others, the article is
inseparable from it; and its meaning, accord. to
Ibn-En-Nahhás is the manifest and magnified,
from أَعْرَبَ “ he made clear, plain,” &c.; or
accord. to an authority cited in the R, its meaning is mercy. (TA.) [See art. ابجد.]

being Arabian: (S, K, TA:) each [said to be]
an inf. n. having no verb. (TA. [But see عَرُبَ
at the commencement of this art. and under
أَعْرَبَ.]) And ↓ عَرَبِيَّةٌ is used [in the same sense]
as denoting the quality of a horse such as is
termed عَرَبِىٌّ. (TA.)

words are with the article ال. (TA in art.
