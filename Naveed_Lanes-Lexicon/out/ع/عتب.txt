لَمْ يَنْبُ عَنْهَا وَخَافَ الجَوْرَ فَاعْتَتَبَا

favour, they shall not be regarded with favour:
(Jel:) or if they petition their Lord to cancel
their compact, [or to restore them to the world,
He will not do so; i. e.] He will not restore them
to the world; (O, K, TA;) knowing that, if they
were restored, they would return to that which
they have been forbidden to do: this is the
meaning if we read the verb in the active form:
otherwise, (O, TA,) reading يُسْتَعْتَبُوا [and
مُعْتِبِينَ], as 'Obeyd Ibn-'Omeyr did, (O,) the
meaning is, If God cancelled their compact, and
restored them to the world, they would not [return
from their evil ways, and] act obediently to God:

cited above in the explanations of that verb: (S,
O, TA:) [but the prov. here mentioned may be
well rendered thou shalt return from thine evil
way against thy wish; for,] accord. to Fr, العُتْبَى
in the phrase لَكَ لعُتْبَى signifies the returning, from

-A2-  العِتْبَانُ The male hyena: (Kr, TA:) and
أُمُّ عِتْبَانَ and ↓ أُمُّ عَتَّابِ [the latter of the measure
كَتَّان, accord. to the CK and my MS. copy of
the K, but in the TA of the measure كتاب, and
therefore ↓ عِتَابٍ,] the female hyena: (K:) said
to be so called because of her limping: but ISd
says, I am not sure of this. (TA.)
عِتَابٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
five places.
عَتُوبٌ One upon whom reproof, blame, or censure, does not operate. (O, K.)
-A2-  And A road,
or way. (TA, as from the K [in which I do
not find it].)
قَرْيَةٌ عَتِيبَةٌ [A town, or village,] in which is little
of good, or of good things. (O, K.)
عَتَّابٌ One who reproves, blames, or censures,
much, or frequently, [in an absolute sense, (see 1,)
or] in anger, or displeasure. (Msb.) [See also
عِتْبٌ.]
-A2-  أُمُّ عَتَّابٍ: see عِتْبَانٌ.
أُعْتُوبَةٌ [like أُسْبُوبَةٌ &c.] A thing [meaning
speech] with which one is reproved, blamed, or
censured. (O, K.) See 6.
مَعْتَبَةٌ and مَعْتِبَةٌ: see 1, in three places.
مَعْتُوبٌ is for مَعْتُوبٌ عَلَيْهِ [i. e. Reproved,
blamed, or censured; &c.]: Mtr says, it is said
to signify مُفْسِدٌ [corrupting, rendering unsound,
vitiating, &c.]; but I am not sure of it.
(Har p. 77.)
مُعْتَتَبٌ [is used, agreeably with analogy, in the
sense of the inf. n. of اِعْتَتَبَ]. El-Kumeyt says,
الشَّوْقُ مِنْ فُؤَادِى وَالش ↓ فاعْتَتَبَ
شِعْرُ إِلَى مَنْ إِلَيْهِ مُعْتَتَبُ
[And desire turned away from my heart, and
my poetry unto him unto whom was its turning].
(S, O.)
مُسْتَعْتَبٌ is used in the sense of [the inf. n. of
اِسْتَعْتَبَ, meaning] اِسْتِرْضَاءٌ: thus in the saying,
وَلَا بَعْدَ المَوْتِ مِنْ مُسْتَعْتَبٍ [And after death
there is no asking, petitioning, or soliciting, favour
of God]: for after death is the abode of retribution, not that of works. (TA from a trad.)
