signifies [also] I am responsible for thy security
from this thing. (ISh, O, K.)
5
تعهّدهُ He renewed his acquaintance with it,
or his knowledge of it; (S, O, L, Msb, K;) this
is the proper signification; (Msb;) as also
↓ اعتهدهُ; (O, * L, K;) and ↓ تعاهدهُ; (L, K;)
and ↓ عاهدهُ, inf. n. مُعَاهَدَةٌ: (L:) and he sought
it, or sought for it or after it, it being absent from
him; syn. تَفَقَّدَهُ; as also ↓ تعاهدهُ, and ↓ اعتهده:
(K:) or تعهّدهُ and تفقّدهُ are used, by some, each
in the place of the other; but accord. to Er-Rághib and many others, the former signifies he
sought, or sought leisurely or repeatedly, to obtain
knowledge of it, having known of it before; and
the latter, he sought, or sought leisurely or repeatedly, to obtain knowledge of it, having lost it:
(MF in art. فقد:) or تعهّدهُ signifies he renewed
his acquaintance with it, or his knowledge of it,
and sought, or sought leisurely or repeatedly, to
find means of rectifying it, reforming it, or putting
it into a good or right or proper state: (IDrst,
TA:) or he came to it, and rectified it, reformed
it, or put it into a good or right or proper state:
(Mgh:) or as first expl. above, and also he returned to it time after time, or went frequently to
it, and rectified it, reformed it, or put it into a
good or right or proper state: (Msb:) or, simply, [as also ↓ تعاهدهُ,] he returned, or recurred,
to it time after time, [see an instance voce أَخْرَقُ,]
or went frequently to it: (Et-Tedmuree, TA:)
and also [i. e. both signify also he paid repeated,
or frequent, attention to it; or] he was careful,
or mindful, of it; or attentive to it. (S, O,
Msb. *) One says also, تَعَهَّدْتُ فُلَانًا [I renewed
my acquaintance with such a one; repaired, or
betook myself, to him frequently; paid frequent
attention to him; or simply paid attention to
him]. (S, O.) And تَعَهَّدْتُ ضَيْعَتِى, (S, O, Mgh,)
properly signifying I renewed my acquaintance
with, or my knowledge of, my estate, is used as
meaning I came to my estate, and put it into a
good or right or proper condition: (Mgh:) [or I
paid repeated, or frequent, or much, attention to
it, taking good and effectual care of it; I husbanded it well:] or, accord. to IDrst, the verb
here has the meaning given above on his authority: or, accord. to Ed-Tedmuree, the meaning
is that given above as his explanation; and is
from عَهْدٌ as signifying “ rain that falls after other
rain,” or from the same word as signifying “ a
place of abode in which one has known a thing: ”
(TA:) and one may say also ↓ تَعَاهَدْتُ; (Fr,
ISk, Mgh;) but تَعَهَّدْتُ is more chaste, (El-Fá-
rábee, S, O, Msb,) because ↓ تَعَاهُدٌ is only between two [or more]: (S, O:) or تعاهدت is not
allowable, (AZ, AHát, Th, IF, Msb,) for the
reason just mentioned: (IF, Msb:) AZ says that
six Arabs of the desert, of chaste speech, being
asked in the presence of himself and of Yoo, one
after another, whether they said تعهّدت ضيعتى
or ↓ تعاهدت, all answered, تعهّدت. (AHát, TA.)

there specified]. (K.) Hence, ذُو عَهْدٍ, an appel-lation given to a Christian, and a Jew, [and a
Sabian, who is a subject of a Muslim government,] meaning One between whom and the Muslims a compact, or covenant, subsists, whereby
the latter are responsible for his security [and
