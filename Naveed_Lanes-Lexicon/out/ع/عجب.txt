عجب1
عَجِبَ مِنْهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) [and لَهُ, as
shown by what follows,] aor.
عَجَبَ, inf. n. عَجَبٌ;
(Msb, TA;) and منه ↓ تعجّب, and ↓ استعجب
منه, (S, O, Msb, K,) which two are syn. each
with the other, (S, O, K,) and with the first also;
(S, K;) all signify He wondered at it; i. e. he
deemed it strange, extraordinary, or improbable,
said of a thing occurring, or presenting itself, to
him; (K, TA;) on account of his being little
accustomed to it: (TA:) or the first signifies [as
above, i. e.] he deemed it strange, extraordinary, or
improbable: and ↓ تَعَجُّبٌ is of two kinds; one is
[the wondering] at a thing which one commends,
and it means the accounting (a thing) good or goodly,
or approving [it], and expressing one's approval of
a thing; and the other is at a thing that one dislikes, and it means the deeming [a thing] strange,
extraordinary, or improbable, and discommending
[it]: (Msb:) or, accord. to some of the grammarians, it signifies the mind's becoming affected,
or acted upon, by some excessive quality in the
thing by which it is so affected; [so that it may
be rendered the becoming affected with wonder;]
as when one says مَا أَشْجَعَهُ [“ how courageous is
he! ”] and أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ [“ how clearly shall
they hear! and how clearly shall they see! ”]:
(Msb, MF, TA:) or it is [the wondering] at a
thing of which the cause, or reason, is hidden,
and not known: or it is when one sees a thing
that pleases him, and thinks that he has not seen
the like of it: (L, TA:) [therefore تَعَجَّبَ مِنْهُ
may be rendered he wondered at it, and he admired it:] accord. to some, it peculiarly relates
to what is deemed good or goodly, or approved;
[though this is inconsistent with the application
of the grammatical term فِعْلُ التَّعَجُّبِ the verb of
wonder;] and the subst. derived from it is
↓ عَجْبٌ: and ↓ استعجب relates to what is good or
goodly or approved, and to what is otherwise;
and the subst. is ↓ عَجَبٌ [which is also the inf. n.
of عَجِبَ]: or accord. to the A and L,
↓ استعجب signifies he wondered at a thing intensely; or became affected with intense wonder.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  [عَجَبًا لِهٰذَا, a phrase of common occurrence, (mentioned in the K voce وَيْبٌ, &c.,) is
for أَعْجَبُ عَجَبًا لِهٰذَا I wonder greatly, lit. with
wondering, at this. See also an ex. voce عَجَبٌ,
last sentence but two.] ―
-b3-  Of the words in the
Kur xxxvii. 12, there are two readings, بَلْ
عَجِبْتَ وَيَسْخَرُونَ and بل عَجِبْتُ ويسخرون:
accord. to the former, the meaning is, Nay, thou
wonderest at their conduct, or deemest it extraordinary, [O Mohammad,] and they mock: respecting the latter reading, [which may be
rendered Nay, I wonder, &c.,] it is observed that
عَجَبٌ when attributed to God has a meaning
different from that which it has when attributed
to men: IAth says that, when attributed to God,
it is used in a tropical manner, as the causes of
things are not hidden from Him: or, accord. to
IAmb, the verb here meams I have recompensed
them for their wondering at the truth, or their
deeming it strange or improbable: and in like
manner it is said [in the Kur viii. 30], يَمْكُرُونَ
وَيَمْكُرُ اللّٰهُ [lit. “ They plot and God plotteth ”],
meaning, “God recompenseth them for their
plotting. ” (L, TA.) ―
-b4-  It is also said that عَجَبٌ
when attributed to God [sometimes] means The
being well pleased, content, or satisfied. (K, TA.)
The saying, in a trad., عَجِبَ رَبُّكَ مِنْ قَوْمٍ يُقَادُونَ
إِلَى الجَنَّة فِى السَّلَاسِلِ means Thy Lord wonders
at a people who will be led to Paradise in chains
[because of their deeming themselves unworthy
thereof]; the verb عجب being here used in a
tropical sense: or the meaning is, thy Lord is
well pleased with, and will reward, a people &c.:
and there are other trads. of the same kind. (L,
TA.) ―
-b5-  عَجِبَ إِلَيْهِ means He loved, or liked,
him, or it. (L, TA.) [See a verse cited voce
عَجِيبٌ; from which it seems to signify lit. He,
or it, was an object of love to him.]
-A2-  عَجِبَتْ,
inf. n. عَجَبٌ; and عَجُبَتْ; said of a she-camel,
She was, or became, such as is termed عَجْبَآء
(TA.)
2
عجّبهُ, inf. n. تَعْجِيبٌ, He caused him to
wonder, (S, O, K, TA,) بِالشَّىْءِ [by the thing].
(TA. [See also 4.])
4
اعجبهُ It (a thing, or an affair, or event, TA)
induced, or excited, him to wonder. (K, TA.
[See also 2.]) In the following saying of Ibn-
Keys-er-Rukeiyát,
رَأَتْ فِى الرَّأْسِ مِنِّى شَيْبَةً لَسْتُ أُغَيِّبُهَا
فَقَالَتْ لِى ابْنُ قَيْسٍ ذَا وَبَعْضُ الشَّيْبِ يُعْجِبُهَا
the meaning is, [She saw upon my head some
hoariness, which I did not hide; and she said to
me, “Is this Ibn-Keys? ” somewhat of hoariness]
causing her to have wonder. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And It
(a thing, or an affair, or event, TA) induced in
him wonder, or admiration, and pleasure, or joy:
(K:) or it excited his admiration, or approval:
(Msb:) or it pleased, or rejoiced, him. (TA.)
You say, أَعْجَبَنِى هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ لِحُسْنِهِ [This thing
has excited my admiration, or approval, or has
pleased me, for its goodness, or goodliness, or
beauty]. (S, O.) And أَعْجَبَنِى حُسْنُهُ [Its goodness, or goodliness, or beauty, excited my admiration, &c.]. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  And أُعْجِبَ بِهِ He was
excited to wonder, or admiration, and pleasure,
or joy, by it; he admired it, and was pleased with
it, or rejoiced by it. (K.) You say, أُعْجِبَ
بِنَفْسِهِ, (S, O, Msb,) inf. n. إِعْجَابٌ, [which is
often used as syn. with عُجْبٌ, the corresponding
subst.,] (O,) [He admired himself, (lit. was excited to admiration by himself,) was pleased with
himself, or was self-conceited, or vain; or] he
exalted, and magnified, himself; was haughty,
and proud. (Msb.) ―
-b4-  [مَا أَعْجَبَهُ generally signifies How wonderful is it!] ―
-b5-  مَا أَعْجَبَهُ بِرَأْيِهِ
[How greatly does he admire his opinion or judgment! or how greatly is he pleased with it! or
how conceited, or vain, or proud, is he of it!] is
anomalous [in two respects], (S, O, K,) not to
be taken as an example to be imitated; (S, O;)
for the verb here is formed from a passive [and
augmented] verb [أُعْجِبَ], like as is the case in
مَا أَشْغَلَهُ; whereas it is the primary rule with
respect to the verb of wonder that it shall not be
formed from any but an active [and unaugmented]
verb. (TA.)
5
تَعَجَّبَ see 1, in two places. ―
-b2-  One says also,
تعجّب فِى مِشْيَتِهِ [app. meaning He showed
عُجْب, i. e. self-admiration, &c., in his gait].
(TA voce تَفَخَّتَ.)
-A2-  تَعَجَّبَنِى signifies تَصَبَّانِى
[He excited my desire, and invited me, or made
me to incline, to ignorant, or foolish, or silly, and
youthful, conduct, so that I yearned towards him:
or he deceived me, or beguiled me, and captivated
my heart]; (O, K, TA;) said of a man: (O,
TA:) and تَفَتَّنَنِى [in the O تَفَتَّتَنِى, which I
think a mistranscription, though I do not find
تَفَتَّنَ elsewhere in the sense here assigned to it,]
signifies the same. (TA.)
10
إِسْتَعْجَبَ see 1, in three places.
عَجْبٌ: see عَجَبٌ, in two places:
-A2-  and see
also عُجْبٌ.
-A3-  Also The root, or base, of the
tail: (S, O, K:) or the part of the root, or base,
of the tail, of any beast, which the haunch
encloses, (Msb, TA,) and which is inserted in the
hinder part of the rump: (TA:) or the root, or
base, and bone, of the tail: (Lh, TA:) also
called the عُصْعُص [q. v.]: (Msb, TA:) or it is
the head of the عُصْعُص: (TA:) or the upper
part of the عُصْعُص: or the external extremity of
the spine; and the عُصْعُص is its internal extremity: (Az, L voce قُحْقُحٌ:) it is said in a trad.,
that every part of a man will become consumed,
except the عَجْب, (TA,) or the عَجْب of the tail,
(O, TA,) accord. to different relations; (TA;)
from which [as a rudiment] he was created, and
upon which he will [at the resurrection] be put
together: (O:) i. e. the bone at the lower, or
lowest, part of the spine, at the rump; which is
the عَسِيب of beasts: it is said to be like a grain
of mustard-seed: or, as Z says in the “ Fáïk,” it
is the bone that is between the buttocks: it is also
pronounced ↓ عُجْبٌ; and accord. to MF, ↓ عِجْبٌ,
but no one else says this: and, as El-Khafájee
says, it is also called عَجْمٌ and عُجْمٌ and عِجْمٌ, in
this case with the three vowel-sounds. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Also (tropical:)  The hinder part (S, O, K, TA) of a tract
of sand, (S, O,) or of anything: (K, TA:) and
hence, عَجْبُ كَثِيبٍ i. e. the thin hinder portion
[of a sand-hill, or of an extended and gibbous
sand-hill, or of a collection of sand that has
poured down]: (TA:) pl. عُجُوبٌ, (S, O,) and
perhaps أَعْجَابٌ also in the former sense [and
therefore in this likewise]. (TA.)
عُجْبٌ: see عَجَبٌ. ―
-b2-  Also a subst. from the
phrase أُعْجِبَ بِنَفْسِهِ, (S,) or from الإِعْجَابُ;
(O;) [i. e. it signifies Self-admiration; or selfconceitedness; or] vanity; and pride: (K:) it is
said to be [a result, or an offspring, of stupidity,
or folly; or] a redundance of stupidity, or folly,
which one has turned to what is thus termed.
(TA.) [Er-Rághib makes a distinction between
عُجْبٌ and تِيهٌ; as will be seen below, voce
مُعْجَبٌ.]
-A2-  Also, and ↓ عَجْبٌ, and ↓ عِجْبٌ, A
man who is pleased to sit with women, (O, K,) and
to converse with them, without his doing what induces
doubt, or suspicion, or evil opinion: (O:) or with
whom women are pleased: (K, TA:) the pl. is
perhaps أَعْجَابٌ. (TA.)
-A3-  See also عَجْبٌ.
عِجْبٌ: see عُجْبٌ:
-A2-  and see also عَجْبٌ.
عَجَبٌ [originally an int. n.] (S, O, K) and
↓ عُجْبٌ, (accord. to the K,) or ↓ عَجْبٌ, (accord.
to the TA,) Wonder; i. e. a deeming strange,
extraordinary, or improbable, what occurs, or
presents itself, to one, (K, TA,) on account of
being little accustomed to it; (TA;) or [the effect,
upon the mind, of] the consideration of a thing
with which one is not familiar, and to which one
is not accustomed: (IAar, TA:) for a distinction
between عَجَبٌ and ↓ عَجْبٌ, see 1, in the middle
of the paragraph: the pl. of عَجَبٌ [in this sense]
is [said to be] أَعْجَابٌ; (K;) or it has no pl.:
(S, O, K:) [this statement correctly applies to
عَجَبٌ as an epithet; for as such it is app. used
as sing. and pl., being originally an inf. n.:] but
El-'Ajjáj has pluralized it, [regarding it in the
sense expl. above,] saying,
ذَكَرْنَ أَشْجَابًا لِمَنْ تَشَجَّبَا
وَهِجْنَ أَعْجَابًا لِمَنْ تَعَجَّبَا
[They mentioned griefs to him who grieved, and
they excited wonder to him who wondered]. (O.)
يَا لَلْعَجَبِ [may be rendered O case of wonder!
but properly] means O wonder come, for this is
thy time: and يَا لِلْعَجَبِ [may also be rendered
O case of wonder! but properly] means O [people,
or the like, come] to wonder; the noun signifying the invoked being suppressed. (Har p. 27.)
-A2-  It is also an epithet applied to a thing, an
affair, an event, or a case; one says أَمْرٌ عَجَبٌ
[A wonderful thing or affair &c.]; and so
↓ عَجِيبٌ [which is more common in this sense],
and ↓ عُجَابٌ, and ↓ عُجَّابٌ: or ↓ عَجِيبٌ is syn.
with عَجَبٌ; but ↓ عُجَابٌ signifies more than
عَجَبٌ: (K:) or ↓ عُجَابٌ is syn. with ↓ عَجِيبٌ,
(S, O,) which signifies a thing, (S, O, Msb,) or
an affair, or event, or a case, (S, O,) wondered
at; (S, O, Msb, TA;) or inducing wonder, or
admiration, and pleasure, or joy; or pleasing, or
rejoicing; syn. ↓ مُعْجِبٌ; (TA;) and ↓ عُجَّابٌ;
signifies more than عَجَبٌ: (S, O, TA:) [it is
said that] عَجَبٌ has no pl.; [app. meaning when
it is used as an epithet, as observed above;] nor
has ↓ عَجِيبٌ; (S, O, K;) or the pl. of this is
عَجَائِبُ [respecting which see عَجِيبَةٌ]; (S, O, K;)
like as أَفَائِلُ is pl. of أَفِيلٌ; and تَبَائِعُ, of تَبِيعٌ.
(S, O.) [Being originally an inf. n., it is used
alike as masc. and fem.:] one says قِصَّةٌ عَجَبٌ
[meaning A wonderful story: and for the same
reason, it may, as an epithet, be also used alike
as sing. and pl.: like عَدْلٌ &c.]. (O.) ―
-b2-  [It is
also used as a subst. in a pl. sense, signifying
Wonders, as meaning wonderful things; like the
pl. عَجَائِبُ, &c.; and it may be similarly used
in a sing. sense for شَىْءٌ عَجَبٌ or أَمْرٌ عَجَبٌ: but
when used as a subst. in the pl. sense expl. above,
it seems to be regarded by some as a coll. gen. n.,
of which ↓ عَجَبَةٌ is the n. un.; for] one says, مَا
فُلَانٌ إِلَّا عَجَبَةٌ مِنَ العَجَبِ [Such a one is none
other than a wonder of wonders]. (A, TA.)
[Hence, also,] أَبُو العَجَبِ [lit. The father of
wonders] is a surname of Fortune. (TA.) And
it signifies also The practiser of legerdemain, or
sleight-of-hand; syn. الشَّعْوَذِىُّ, (A, TA,) or
المُشَعْوِذُ: (Eth-Tha'álibee, TA in شعذ:) and
any one who does wonderful things. (A, TA.)
And a poet says,
يَا عَجَبًا لِلدَّهْرِ ذِى الأَعْجَابِ
[for يَا أَعْجَبُ عَجَبًا O, I wonder greatly, lit. with
wondering, at fortune that is ever attended with
wonders]. (TA.) [See also عَجِيبَةٌ.]
-A3-  Also
The quality, in a she-camel, that is denoted by
the epithet عَجْبَآءُ [fem. of أَعْجَبُ, q. v.]; and so
↓ عُجْبَةٌ. (O.)
عُجْبَةٌ: see the last preceding sentence.
عَجَبَةٌ: see عَجَبٌ, last quarter.
عُجَابٌ: see عَجَبٌ, in three places, near the
middle of the paragraph: ―
-b2-  and see also عَاجِبٌ.
عَجِيبٌ: see عَجَبٌ, in four places, near the
middle of the paragraph. ―
-b2-  Also Loved, beloved,
or an object of love: so in the following verse,
cited by Th:
وَمَا البُخْلُ يَنْهَانِى وَلَا الجُودُ قَادَنِى
وَلٰكِنَّهَا ضَرْبٌ إِلَىَّ عَجِيبٌ
[And neither does niggardliness forbid me nor
liberality lead me; but she is a sort of person,
to me, an object of love]: by قَادَنِى, the poet
means يَقُودُنِى. (L, TA.)
عَجِيبَةٌ (K) and ↓ أُعْجُوبَةٌ (S, O, K) A wonderful
thing; a thing at which one wonders: (S, O, K: *)
[the pl. of the former, accord. to modern usage, is
عَجَائِبُ, mentioned above as pl. of عَجَبٌ: and]
أَعَاجِيبُ seems to be pl. of أُعْجُوبَةٌ, like as أَحَادِيثُ
is pl. of أُحْدُوثَةُ: (S, O:) and ↓ تَعَاجِيبُ signifies
wonderful things; syn. عَجَائِبُ; (S, O, K;) and
is a word [of a rare form, (see تَبَاشِيرُ,)] having no
proper sing., (S, O,) like تَعَاشِيبُ; (O;) erroneously thought by the author of the “ Námoos ”
[on the Kámoos] to be most probably a mistake
for أَعَاجِيبُ: (TA:) a poet says,
وَمَنْ تَعَاجِيبِ خَلْقِ اللّٰهِ غَاطِيَةٌ
يُعْصَرُ مِنْهَا مُلَاحِىٌّ وَغِرْبِيبُ
[And of the wonderful things of God's creation is
a grape-vine covering the ground (so غَاطِيَةٌ is expl.
by IB), whereof grapes of the kinds called ملاحىّ
and غربيب are pressed for making wine].
(S, O.)
عُجَّابٌ: see عَجَبٌ, near the middle of the paragraph, in two places.
عَجَبٌ عَاجِبٌ [meaning Very wonderful or
admirable or pleasing] (S, O, K) is like لَيْلٌ لَائِلٌ,
the latter word being a corroborative of the
former; (S, O;) and one says also [in like
manner] ↓ عَجَبٌ عُجَابٌ. (K.)
أَعْجَبُ [More, and most, wonderful or admirable
or pleasing]. ―
-b2-  [And the fem.] عَجْبَآءُ signifies A
female wondered at for her beauty: and also, for
her ugliness. (O, K.)
-A2-  Also, i. e. the former,
A thick, or big, or coarse, camel. (O, K. *) And
so the fem. applied to a she-camel: (O, K:) or,
so applied, thick in the عَجْب [or root, &c.,] of
the tail: (TA:) or whereof the hinder part, (O,
K,) or the upper portion of that part, (L, TA,)
is narrow, and whereof the جَاعِرَتَانِ [q. v.] are
prominent: (O, L, K, TA:) the kind of make
thus particularized is ugly. (TA.)
أُعْجُوبَةٌ: see عَجِيبَةٌ.
رَجُلٌ تِعْجَابَةٌ A man of (lit. having, possessing,
or endowed with,) wonders, or wonderful things.
(O, K, TA.)
تَعَاجِيبُ, a pl. without a sing.: see عَجِيبَةٌ.
مُعْجَبٌ بِنَفْسِهِ, and بِرَأْيِهِ, [Admiring himself,
(lit. excited to admiration by himself,) or pleased
with himself, and his opinion, or judgment; selfconceited, and conceited of his opinion or judgment,]
(S, O, TA,) [or] vain, or proud, [thereof; for]
مُعْجَبٌ signifies a man vain, or proud, of what
proceeds from him, whether good or bad, and of
himself, or of a thing [belonging to him, such as
his dress or wealth &c.]: but Er-Rághib makes
a distinction between مُعْجَبٌ and تَائِهٌ; saying
that the معجب believes himself with respect to
the opinion or judgment that he forms of himself
indecisively from evidence outweighed in probability; [so that it rather denotes conceit than
vanity;] whereas the تائه believes himself decisively. (MF, TA.)
مُعْجِبٌ [Inducing wonder, or admiration, &c.]:
see عَجَبٌ, in the middle of the paragraph: [or]
a thing that is very good or goodly or beautiful.
(TA.)
