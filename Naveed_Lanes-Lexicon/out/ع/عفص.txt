عَفْصٌ [Galls: and the trees which bear them:]
a certain thing well known, (Msb, K,) of which
ink is made, (S, O, TA,) and with which one tans;
(Msb;) the produce of the tree called بَلُّوط [or
oak]: (L, TA:) or applied to the trees [which
bear it] and to the fruit [thereof]: (K:) or a
certain tree of the kind called بَلُّوط, which [is also
the name of a produce of that tree, i. e., of the
acorn, (both of which applications are agreeable
with modern usage,) like as عَفْصٌ is also the name
of another produce thereof, i. e., the gall, or gallnut; for it is said that this tree] bears one year
بَلُّوط, and another year عَفْص, (Lth, O, K,) of
which ink is made: (CK:) it is not of the growth
of the land of the Arabs: (IB, TA:) it is astringent; drying; having the quality of repelling
effluent matters; and strengthening flaccid and
weak members; (K, TA;) and especially the
teeth; (TA;) and when steeped in vinegar, it
blackens the hair: (K:) the word is post-classical;
(S, O, K;) not of the language of the people of
the desert: (S, IF, O, Msb:) or it is Arabic;
(AHn, O, K;) and from it is derived ↓ عُفُوصَةٌ,
signifying “ a taste in which is astringency and
bitterness; ” as also the epithet ↓ عَفِصٌ, applied
to a taste. (AHn, O.)
عَفَصٌ A twisting in the nose: (O, K:) so they
say. (O.)
عَفِصٌ A taste (AHn, S, O, Msb) having an
astringent quality, (AHn, S, O, Msb, K,) and
bitterness, (AHn, O, K,) which render swallowing
difficult; (TA;) disagreeable and choking; or disagreeable, with dryness and bitterness; or rough;
syn. بَشِعٌ. (TA.) See عَفْصٌ.

relaters of traditions of whom each bore this
appellation are mentioned in the TA.]
عِفَاصٌ The receptacle in which is put money or
the like that one expends, (A'Obeyd, Az, A, Mgh,
O, Msb, K,) or, as some say, in which is the pastor's money or the like that he expends, (TA,)
made of skin, or of a piece of rag, or other material. (A'Obeyd, Az, A, * Mgh, O, Msb, K. *) ―
-b2-
And hence, (A'Obeyd, O, Az, &c.,) The skin with
which the head of a flask, or bottle, is covered:
(A 'Obeyd, Az, S, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K:) it is said
to be its صِمَام [or stopper]; (Az, Mgh, O, Msb;)
by Lth; (Az, O, Msb;) but the right explanation is that given by A 'Obeyd: (Az, Msb:) that
which enters into its mouth is the صِمَام: (S:) or
it has this latter signification also: (A:) or it
signifies accord. to El-Ghooree, (Mgh,) or signifies also, (A, K,) the case (غِلَاف [which has
app. been misunderstood as meaning the skin
cover of the head of a flask or bottle, before
mentioned.]) of a flask, or bottle: (A, Mgh, O,
K:) but the first is the explanation that is preferred. (Mgh.) [See 1, first signification.)
عُفُوصَةٌ in taste, (S,) Astringency (S, K) and
bitterness, (K,) which render swallowing difficult:
(TA:) a taste in which is astringency and bitterness: derived from عَفْصٌ, q. v. (AHn, O.) [See
