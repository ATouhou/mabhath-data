عalphabetical letter
ع
The eighteenth letter of the alphabet: called عَيْنٌ.
It is [one of the letters termed مَجْهُورَة, or vocal,
i. e. pronounced with the voice, not with the
breath only; and] of the letters termed حَلْقِيَّة
[or faucial]; these being ع and ح and ه and خ
and غ [and أ]; the lowest of which in its place
of utterance is ع; wherefore Kh [in the composition of his lexicon entitled “ Kitáb el-'Eyn ”] and
several other lexicographers [after him] began
their books with [words having] this letter [in
their roots], giving the next place to ح, the next
to ه, the next to خ, and the next to غ. (L, TA.)
It is substituted for ء [in what is termed the عَنْعَنَة
of Temeem]; as in عَنْ for أَنْ: and for ح; as
in عَتَّى for حَتَّى, and صُبْعٌ for صُبْحٌ: and for غ;
as in عُلَامٌ for غُلَامٌ. (MF, TA.) It is never
consociated with ح in any word of which the
letters are all radicals; unless it be a word compounded of two words, as حَيْعَلَ from حَىَّ عَلَى.
(Kh, TA.)
-A2-  [As a numeral, it denotes Seventy.]
