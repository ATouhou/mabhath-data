عى1
عَىَّ بِأَمْرِهِ, (S,) or بِالأَمْرِ, (MA, Msb, K,) and
عَن الأَمْرِ, (MA,) and الأَمْرَ also, (MA, and Ham
p. 717,) and عَيِىَ, (S, Msb, K,) [which is the
original form,] but عَىَّ is more common, (S,
TA,) and أَعْيَا بِهِ is not allowable, (TA,) first
pers. عَيِيتُ, (S,) pl. عَيُوا, (S, TA,) like حَيُوا
[from حَىَّ and حَيِىَ], (S,) and عَيُّوا also, which
is used by a poet, (S, TA,) aor. يَعْيَا, (Msb, TA),
inf. n. عِىٌّ; (Msb, TA;) as also ↓ تعيّا, and
↓ تعايا, and ↓ استعيا; (K;) He found not the
right way, or manner, (S, Msb, K, TA,) that he
desired, (K, TA,) or the way, or manner, of his
acting [i. e. in which he should act], (TA,) to
perform, or accomplish, his, or the, affair: (S,
Msb, K, TA:) or he lacked power, strength, or
ability, for it; (MA, Mgh, * K, TA;) and was
unable to perform it, or execute it, thoroughly.
(K, TA.) [Hence,] one says, شِفَآءُ العِىِّالسُّؤَالُ
(tropical:)  [The remedy of inability is the asking information]. (TA in art. شفى.) ―
-b2-  And in like
manner one says, عَيَّ عَنْ حُجَّتِهِ, (Msb, TA,)
and عَيِىَ, aor. and inf. n. as above, i. e. He
found not the right way, or manner, of adducing
his argument, plea, or evidence. (Msb, TA. *)

Msb, K,) aor. as above, (Msb,) and so the inf. n.,
(Msb, K,) He found not the right way, or
manner, in his expressing of his ideas: (Msb:)
or i. q. حَصِرَ; (K;) or [nearly so, i. e.] عَيِىَ [or
عَىَّ] signifies he was, or became, unable to express
his mind, to say what he would, to find words to
express what he would say; he faltered in speech;
like حَصِرَ, except that the latter denotes what is
by reason of shame and confusion of mind, or
some [other] accidental cause: (TA in art. حصر,
from the Expos. of the “ Mufassal ” of Z:)
العِىُّ is the contr. of البَيَانُ [q. v.]: (S, TA:) or,
accord. to Er-Rághib, it is an inability that
ensues to one who has taken upon himself an affair
or a speech. (TA.) One says, جَآءَ بِالعِىِّ وَالشِّىِّ
[app. meaning He exhibited much impotence of
expression]; (S and K and TA in art. شوى;)
using the latter noun as an imitative sequent to
the former [for the purpose of corroboration].
(TA in that art.) ―
-b4-  And عَيِيتُهُ I was ignorant of
it: (K, TA:) originally meaning I was unable
to give information respecting it when asked, by
reason of ignorance of it. (TA.) One says, لَا
يَعْيَاهُ أَحَدٌ No one will be ignorant of it. (TA.)

enigmatical, or obscure; syn. إِلْغَازٌ: or doing a
deed to [the understanding of] the way, or
manner, of which the right direction is not to be
found. (TA.) One says, إِيّاكَ وَمَسَائِلَ المُعَايَاةِ
فَإِنَّهَا صَعْبَةُ المُعَانَاةِ [Avoid thou the questions of
enigmatical, or obscure, diction; for they are
difficult to be endured]: and عَايَاهُ, [He addressed
to him enigmatical, or obscure, speech, (like
حَاجَاهُ, and لَاغَزَهُ,)] inf. n. مُعَايَاةٌ. (TA. [See

kesreh of the former ى to the ع], as is done in a
verse of El-Hotei-ah. (TA.)
-A2-  اعياهُ It made
him to be without power, or strength, or ability;
disabled, or incapacitated, him; (S, * MA, TA;)
said of an affair; (S, MA;) and [app. in like
manner] of God. (S.) It is also said of a disease,
meaning It disabled him, or incapacitated him,
from curing it: (K, * TA:) [or] one says of a
difficult disease, for which there is no cure, كَأَنَّهُ
أَعْيَا الأَطِبَّآءَ [It is as though it disabled, or incapacitated, the physicians; or frustrated their skill;
or baffled them]. (S, TA.) And a poet says,
(namely, 'Amr Ibn-Hassán, TA)
فَإِنَّ الكُثْرَ أَعْيَانِى قَدِيمًا
وَلَمْ أُقْتِرْ لَدُنْ أَنِّى غُلَامُ
[And, or for, abundance of wealth baffled my
attempts to obtain it of old; but I have not been
poor from the time of my being a boy]: (S, TA:)
he means, I have been in a middling condition;
not very poor, nor able to collect much wealth:
but some relate the verse otherwise, saying أَعْنَانِى
i. e. “ rendered me humble, lowly, or submissive. ”

عَىٌّ and ↓ عَيِىٌّ, (S, Msb, K, TA,) the former of
which is the more common, (TA,) are epithets
denoting the agent of the verb in the phrases
عَىٌّ بِالأَمْرِ (Msb, K) and عَىَّ عَنْ حُجَّتِهِ (Msb)

of this art.:] and ↓ عَيَّانُ (K) and ↓ عَيَايَآءُ (S, K)

pl. [of عَىٌّ] is أَعْيَآءٌ and [of عَيِىٌّ] أَعْيِيَآءُ; (S, K;)
Sb says, Yoo has informed us of this; and he
says, we have also heard some of the Arabs say
أَعْيِيَآءُ [as above] and أَعْيِيَةٌ. (S.)
عَيَآءٌ An incurable disease; (K;) a difficult
disease, for which there is no cure; as though it
