عصب1
عَصَبَ, aor.
عَصِبَ, (K,) inf. n. عَصْبٌ, (S, A,
Mgh, O, K,) He twisted [a thing], or wound [it]
round: (A, K, TA:) this is the primary signification: (TA:) and he folded [it]; (A, K;) or
he folded [it] tightly: (S, O, TA:) and he bound
[it], or tied [it]: (A, Mgh, K, TA:) عَصْبٌ denotes the binding, or tying, a thing with another
thing, lengthwise, or [more commonly] around.
(O.) See also 2, first sentence. [And see
مَعْصُوبٌ.] ―
-b2-  He twisted, or spun, thread. (K, *
TA.) And He put together thread, and bound
it, previously to dyeing it. (TA.) ―
-b3-  عَصَبَ
الكَبْشَ, (S, O, Msb, K, *] aor. as above, (K,) and
so the inf. n., (S, Msb, K,) He bound, or tied,
(tightly, TA) the testicles of the ram, in order
that they might fall, without his extracting them:
(S, O, Msb, K:) and in like manner one says of
a goat, (K,) and of other beasts. (TA.) ―
-b4-  عَصَبَ
النَّاقَةَ, (O, Msb, K, *) aor. as above, (K,) and so
the inf. n., (Msb, K, TA,) and عِصَابٌ also;
(TA;) and ↓ اعتصبها; (O, K;) He bound the
thighs of the she-camel, (Msb, K, TA,) or the
lower parts of her nostrils, (TA,) with a cord,
(Msb, TA,) in order that she might yield her
milk copiously: (Msb, K, TA:) and (O) عَصَبَ
فَخِذَ النَّاقَةِ [He bound the thigh of the she-camel]
for that purpose. (S, O.) [See عَصُوبٌ.] Hence
one says, أَعْطَى عَلَى العَصْبِ (tropical:)  He gave by means
of force. (TA.) And مِثْلِى لَا يَدِرُّ بِالعِصَابِ (assumed tropical:)  Such
a one as I am will not give by means of force. (A,
TA.) ―
-b5-  عَصَبَتْ فَرْجَهَا She (a woman) bound her
vulva with a bandage. (Msb.) ―
-b6-  عَصَبَ الشَّجَرَةَ,
(S, O, K,) aor.
عَصِبَ, inf. n. عَصْبٌ, (K,) He drew
together the branches of the tree (S, O, K, TA)
that were straggling, (K, TA,) by means of a
rope, (TA,) and then beat it, (S, O, K, TA,) in
order that its leaves might fall. (S, O, TA.)
[Golius assigns this signification also to عَصَّبَ,
as on the authority of the S, in which I do not
find it.] El-Hajjáj said, (S, TA,) when preaching to the people at El-Koofeh, (TA,) لَأَعْصِبَنَّكُمْ
عَصْبَ السَّلَمِ (S) or السَّلَمَةِ (TA) [I will assuredly
draw you together and beat you as one does the
selem or the selemeh]. The سَلَمَة is a tree of the
kind called عِضَاه, having thorns, and its leaves
are the قَرَظ with which hides are tanned: [but
see قَرَظٌ:] the removal of the leaves with the
hand being difficult on account of the many
thorns, its branches are drawn together and
bound tightly with a rope; then the beater pulls
them towards him, and beats them with his staff;
whereupon the leaves become scattered for the
cattle and for him who desires to gather them.
(TA.) Or this is done, (S, O, TA,) accord. to
A 'Obeyd, (S, O,) only (TA) when they desire
to cut down the selemeh, that they may get at
the stock. (S, O, TA.) [Hence,] one says,
فُلَانٌ لَا تُعْصَبُ سَلَمَاتُهُ [Such a one will not have
his selemehs bound round with a rope, and beaten]:
a prov., applied to a strong, mighty man, not to
be subdued nor abased. (A, * TA.) And one
says also of winds, تَعْصِبُ الشَّجَرَ عِنْدَ دُرُوجِهَا فِيهِ
(assumed tropical:)  [They compress the branches of the trees, as
though they bound them round, in their passage
among them]: and such winds are termed
↓ عَصَائِبُ. (O.) And عَصَبَ القَوْمَ, aor.
عَصِبَ, inf. n.
عَصْبٌ, (assumed tropical:)  It (an affair, or event,) drew the people
together, and became severe to them. (Az, TA.)

-b8-
عَصَبَ بِرَأْسِ قَوْمِهِ العَارَ (assumed tropical:)  He made disgrace to
befall his people [as though he bound it upon the
head of their chief or upon the head of each of them].
(O.) It is related in a trad. respecting the battle
of Bedr, that 'Otbeh the son of Rabee'ah said,
اِرْجِعُوا وَلَا تُقَاتِلُوا وَاعْصِبُوهَا بِرَأْسِى (assumed tropical:)  [Return ye,
and fight not; and bind it upon my head];
meaning attach and attribute to me the disgrace
that will befall you for relinquishing the battle
and inclining to peace. (IAth, TA.) And it is
said in another trad., قُومُوا بِمَا عَصَبَكُمْ بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  Fulfil
ye the obligations with which He (meaning God)
has bound you; or which He has imposed upon
you and attached to you; by his commands and
prohibitions. (TA.) ―
-b9-  عَصَبَ الشَّىْءَ and عَلَى
الشَّىْءِ, aor.
عَصِبَ, inf. n. عَصْبٌ and عِصَابٌ, He
grasped the thing with his hand. (K, * TA.) A
poet, cited by IAar, says,
وَكُنَّا يَا قُرَيْشُ إِذَا عَصَبْنَا
يَجِىْءُ عِصَابُنَا بِدَمٍ عَبِيطِ
[And we were, O Kureysh, when we grasped our
opponents, such that our grasping brought fresh
blood]; عِصَابُنَا meaning our grasping those whom
we opposed with the swords. (TA.) ―
-b10-  And
عَصَبَ, aor.
عَصِبَ, inf. n. عَصْبٌ, He clung, or kept, to
a thing. (K.) One says, عَصَبَ المَآءَ He kept to,
or by, the water. (IAar, TA.) And عَصَبَ الرَّجُلُ
بَيْتَهُ The man remained, or stayed, in his house,
or tent, not quitting it. (O, TA.) ―
-b11-  And He
went round, encompassed, or surrounded, a thing.
(K.) It is said in a trad., of the angel Gabriel,
on the day of Bedr, قَدْ عَصَبَ رَأْسَهُ الغُبَارُ The dust
had overspread, [or surrounded,] and clung to,
his head: or, as some relate it, قَدْ عَصَمَ ثَنِيَّتَيْهِ
الغُبَارُ; and if this be not a mistake, the latter
verb is syn. with the former: ب and م being
often interchangeable: (L, TA:) the latter phrase
means, as also with عَصَبَ, the dust had stuck to
his two central incisors. (TA in art. عصم.)
And Ibn Ahmar says,
إِذْ عَصَبَ النَّاسَ شَمَالٌ وَقُرٌ
[وَقُرْ being for وَقُرٌّ] i. e. When north wind and
cold environ me. (L, TA.) And one says also,
عَصَبَ الغُبَارُ بِالجَبَلِ The dust encompassed, or surrounded, the mountain. (L, TA.) And عَصَبُوا بِهِ
They encompassed, or surrounded, him: (S, A,
Mgh, O, TA:) and they encompassed, or surrounded, him, looking at him: (S, O:) and,
(Msb, K,) as also عَصِبُوا, (K,) aor. of the
former
عَصِبَ, (Msb, K,) and inf. n. عَصْبٌ, (Msb,)
and aor. of the latter
عَصَبَ, (K,) they assembled
around him (Msb, K) for fight or defence. (Msb.
For another explanation of عَصَبَ and عَصِبَ,
see 12.) And عَصَبَ القَوْمُ بِالنَّسَبِ i. q. أَحَاطُوا بِهِ
[app. meaning The people, or party, included, or
comprehended, the relations, or kinsmen; for
النَّسَبُ is often used for ذَوُو النَّسَبِ]. (Msb.) And
عَصَبَتِ الإِبِلُ بِالمَآءِ The camels surrounded, or encircled, the water. (S, O.) ―
-b12-  عَصَبَ الرِّيقُ بِفِيهِ,
(S, O, K, * TA,) aor.
عَصِبَ, inf. n. عَصْبٌ; (K, TA;)
and عَصِبَ, aor.
عَصَبَ; (TA;) The saliva became
dry in his mouth. (S, O, K, * TA.) And عَصَبَ
الرِّيقُ فَاهُ (S, O, TA) The saliva by its drying
made his mouth dry: and the saliva adhered to
his mouth. (TA.) Aboo-Mohammad El-Fak'asee
says,
يَعْصِبُ فَاهُ الرِّيقُ أَىَّ عَصْبِ
عَصْبَ الجُبَابِ بِشَفَاهِ الوَطْبِ
[The saliva makes his mouth dry, with what a
drying ! as the drying of the spume of camels'
milk on the lips of the skin]. (S, O.) And
عَصَبَ فُوهُ, aor.
عَصِبَ, inf. n. عَصْبٌ, His mouth, with
his saliva, became dry. (O.) And عَصَبَ الفَمُ,
(K, * TA,) aor.
عَصِبَ, inf. n. عَصْبٌ and عُصُوبٌ,
meaning [The mouth, or teeth, (the latter accord.
to the explanation in the K,)] became foul, or
dirty, from dust and the like, (K, TA,) as from
vehement thirst, or fear. (TA.) ―
-b13-  عَصَبَ, aor.
عَصِبَ,
inf. n. عُصُوبٌ, He was, or became, [hungry; or]
very hungry; or his bowels were almost dried up
with hunger: because it is said of the practice
of a hungry man's binding round his belly, as
expl. voce مَعْصُوبٌ [q. v.]. (TA.) ―
-b14-  عَصَبَ الأُفُقُ
The horizon became red. (S, O. [In Freytag's
Lex. عَصِبَ, as from the K, in which I do not
find it. See عَصْبٌ.])
-A2-  عَصِبَ, (S, O, K,) with
kesr, (S, O,) like فَرِحَ, (K,) said of flesh, or
flesh-meat, It had many عَصَبَ [i. e. sinews, or
tendons]. (S, O, K.) ―
-b2-  And عَصِبَ, aor.
عَصَبَ, inf. n.
عَصْبٌ, [so in the TA, and so in a verse there
cited, not عَصَبٌ,] He was, or became, firm and
compact in flesh. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Other meanings of
this verb have been mentioned above.]
2
عصّب, (S, A, O, &c.,) inf. n. تَعْصِيبٌ, (S,
A, O,) [He bound, or wound round, a thing with
several circumvolutions:] he bound [or wound
round] a man's head with a turban, fillet, bandage,
or the like; (S, * O, * Msb, K, * TA;) as also
↓ عَصَبَ, inf. n. عَصْبٌ: (MA:) and he bound a
broken limb, or a wound, with a piece of rag or
a bandage. (L, TA.) He turbaned a man; attired
him with a turban. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (A, O,)
تَعْصِيبٌ signifies (tropical:)  [The crowning a man: (see the
pass. part. n.:)] the making a man a chief: (A,
O, K, TA:) for turbans are the crowns of the
Arabs: (O:) when a man's people made him a
chief, they bound his head with a turban: (A,
TA:) as kings wore crowns, so the chiefs of the
Arabs wore red turbans: (L, TA:) there were
brought to the desert, from Haráh (هَرَاة), red
turbans, which the nobles among the Arabs wore.
(Az, TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also,] عصّبهُ بِالسَّيْفِ i. q.
عَمَّمَهُ بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He cut, or wounded, him in the place
of the turban, with the sword]. (A, TA.) ―
-b4-
And عصّبهُ, inf. n. as above, He, or it, [caused
him to bind his waist by reason of hunger: (see
the pass. part. n.:) and hence,] made him to
hunger: (K:) and عَصَّبَتْهُمُ السِّنُونَ The years of
drought, or sterility, made them to hunger:

(A 'Obeyd, S, O.) And It [i. e. drought or the
like] destroyed him: (K:) and عصّب الدَّهْرُ مَالَهُ
Adverse fortune destroyed his cattle, or camels &c.
(TA.) ―
-b5-  And He called him مُعَصَّب [meaning
poor]: so says IAar; and he cites as an ex.,
يُدْعَى المُعَصَّبَ مَنْ قَلَّتْ حَلُوبَتُهُ
وَهَلْ يُعَصَّبُ مَاضِى الهَمِّ مِقْدَامُ
[He is called the poor, whose milch-cattle have
become few: but should one whose purpose is effectual, one of great boldness, be called poor?].
(TA.) ―
-b6-  الذَّكَرُ يُعَصِّبُ الأُنْثَى means The male
makes the female to be such as is termed عَصَبَةٌ [by
his being consociated with her as such]. (Mgh.)
4
أَعْصَبَ see 12. ―
-b2-  [Golius explains this v. as meaning “ Firmiter religavit: ” or, as a trans. v.
governing an accus., “constringi jussit: ” as on
the authority of the S, in which I do not find it
in any sense.]
5
تعصّب i. q. شَدَّ العِصَابَةَ [i. e. He bound the
turban, or fillet, round his (own) head; a meaning well known, whence that explained in the
next sentence: (see also 8:) and he bound a

reason of hunger: see مُعَصَّبٌ]. (S, O, Msb, * K.)
―
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  He was made a chief; quasi-pass.
of 2 [q. v.]. (L, TA.) ―

conduct: or he was angry, or zealous, for the sake
of his party, and defended them: (see عَصَبِىٌّ and
عَصَبِيَّةٌ:) or] he invited, or summoned, others to the
aid of his party, and to combine, or league, with
them against those who acted towards them with
hostility, whether they were wrongdoers or wronged.
(TA.) And you say, تَعَصَّبُوا عَلَيْهِمْ They leagued,
or collected themselves, together against them: and
تَعَصَّبْنَا لَهُ, and مَعَهُ, We [leagued together for him,
and with him, and] defended him. (TA.) [See

اعتصب بِهِ: see 5, last sentence.
12
اِعْصَوْصَبَ القَوْمُ The people, or party, collected themselves together: (TA:) or did so, and
became companies such as are called عَصَائِب, (S,
O, TA,) and became one of such companies: [see

-b3-  Also A particular sort of the garments called بُرُود, (S, A, Mgh, O, K,) of the fabric
of El-Yemen; (S, Mgh, O;) a بُرْد of which the
yarn is dyed, and then woven; (Msb;) or of
which the yarn is put together and bound, then
dyed, and then woven; (A, Mgh, TA; *) not of
the sort called بُرُودُ الرَّقْمِ: (TA:) it has no pl.,
(Nh, Msb, TA,) nor dual: (Msb:) you say
بُرْدُ عَصْبٍ (Nh, Mgh, TA) and بُرُودُ عَصْبٍ (Nh,
Mgh, Msb, TA) and يُرْدَا عَصْبٍ, (Msb,) and also
يُرْدٌ عَصْبٌ and بُرُودٌ عَصْبٌ, (Nh, TA,) and ثَوْبٌ,
عَصْبٌ, (Msb,) and أَرْدِيَةُ العَصْبِ; (A, TA;) and
sometimes they say عَصْبٌ alone, the بُرْد being
known by this name: (TA:) or garments of the
kind called بُرُود, of the fabric of El-Yemen, the
yarn of which is put together and bound, and then
dyed, and woven, so that they become partycoloured, because what has been bound thereof remains white, the dye not having taken it; and
such garments a woman in the period termed عِدَّة
[q. v.] is allowed to wear, but not garments that
are [wholly] dyed: or striped garments of the
kind called بُرُود: and what is forbidden in that
case is a garment that has been dyed after it
has been woven; or what are forbidden are the
عَصْب of El-Yemen, which are said to have been
dyed with urine; so in the L &c.: (TA:) or,
accord. to Sub, garments of the kind called بُرُود
of the fabric of El-Yemen; so called because
they are dyed with عَصْب, which grows only in
El-Yemen; [he says that العَصْبُ is a certain dyed
that does not grow but in El-Yemen; (Msb;)]
but in this he opposes the generality of authorities;
for they agree in stating that the garments in
question are thus called from العَصْبُ, “the act of
binding,” because the yarn is bound in order that
the dye may not pervade the whole of the بُرْد.
(MF, TA.) ―
-b4-  Hence, (assumed tropical:)  Clouds like such as are
termed لَطْخ [q. v.]: (S, O:) or red clouds or
mist (K, TA) seen in the western horizon (TA) in
a time of drought, or sterility; as also ↓ عِصَابَةٌ,
(K, TA,) pl. عَصَائِبُ. (TA.)
-A2-  In a trad., mention occurs of a necklace made of عَصْب: ElKhattábee says, if it do not mean the garments
of El-Yemen, I know not what it is; yet I see
not how a necklace can be made of these: Aboo-Moosà thinks it may be عَصَب, meaning the tendons of joints, as they may have taken the tendons
of certain clean animals, and cut them in pieces, and
made them like beads, and, when dry, made neck
laces of them; but he adds his having been told
by some of the people of El-Yemen that عَصْبٌ is
the name of A certain beast of the sea, or of the
great river, called also فَرَسُ فِرْعَوْنَ [i. e. Pharaoh's
horse, perhaps meaning the hippopotamus], of
which [meaning of the teeth or bones of which]
beads and other things, as the handles of knives
&c., are made, and which is white. (L, TA.)
-A3-
And Saliva that sticks and dries in the mouth:
whence the saying, لَفَظَ فُلَانٌ عَصْبَهُ, meaning
(assumed tropical:)  Such a one died. (T and TA in art. لفظ.)
-A4-
And A light, or an active, and sharp-headed,
boy, or young man; (IAar, TA;) [and] so
عَضْبٌ. (IAar, TA in art. عضب.)
عُصْبٌ and ↓ عَصْبٌ and ↓ عَصَبٌ (K, TA) Certain trees that twine round other trees, having
weak leaves; (TA;) the kind of tree called لَبْلَاب
[dolichos lablab of Linn.]; (K;) said by Sh to
be a kind of plant that twines round trees, i. q.
لَبْلَابٌ: [coll. gen. ns.:] the ns. un. are عُصْبَةٌ and
عَصْبَةٌ and عَصَبَةٌ: (TA:) accord. to Abu-lJarráh, (O, TA,) عَصْبَةٌ signifies a certain thing
[app. meaning plant] that twines about a قَنَادَة
[or tragacanth], (O, K, TA,) thus, correctly, in
many copies of the K, but in some فَتَاة, and in
some قَنَاة, both of which are wrong, though some
assert the latter to be correct, (TA,) not to be
pulled off from it but with an effort: (O, K,
TA:) [see عِطْفَةٌ:] one says of a man strong in
struggling for the mastery, قَتَادَةٌ لُوِيَتْ بِعُصْبَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [A
tragacanth twined about by a lebláb; the strong
man being app. likened to a tragacanth, and his
antagonist to a lebláb]: (TA:) and in a trad. of
Ez-Zubeyr Ibn-El-'Owwám, he is related to have
said,
عَلِقْتُهُمْ إِنِّى خُلِقْتُ عُصْبَهْ
قَتَادَةً تَعَلَّقَتْ بِنُشْبَهْ
(O, TA:) he puts عصبه for علقه, [evidently, I
think, a mistranscription for عَلِقًا, (see نُشْبَةٌ, in
its proper art., for a confirmation,)] the meaning
being خلقت علقة لخصومى [in which for علقة I
read عَلِقًا]; then he likens himself to a tragacanth
in respect of his excessive tenaciousness; for
بنشبه means “ by the help of a thing of great
tenaciousness: ” [or نشبه may be here an inf. n.,
i. e. of نَشِبَ: the meaning of the verse may therefore be, I clung to them: verily I have been
created a grasper, and a tragacanth that has
clung by means of a strong holdfast, or that has
clung with great tenaciousness:] (TA:) Sh explains عُصْبَة (O, TA) with damm on the authority
of Ed-Deenawaree [i. e. AHn], and عَصْبَة with
fet-h on the authority of AA, (O,) as meaning
a certain plant that twines about a tree, and is
called لَبْلَاب; and نُشْبَة as meaning a man who,
when he sports with a thing (عَبِثَ بِشَىْءٍ [but
probably the right reading is شَبِثَ بشىء or تَشَبَّثَ
i. e. clings to a thing]), hardly, or never, quits
it. (O, TA.)
عَصَبٌ [The sinews, or tendons; though the following explanation seems rather to denote the
ligaments;] the أَطْنَاب of the joints, (S, O, Msb,
K, TA,) which connect and bind together the
structure thereof, in man and in others, such as
the ox-kind, and sheep or goats, and gazelles,
and ostriches; so says AHn; (TA;) i. q. عَقَبٌ:
(S and K &c. in art. عقب:) or such as are yellow
of the اطناب (Mgh, Msb) of the joints; the عَقَب
being the white: (Mgh:) [it is also used as
meaning ligaments: (see an ex. of its n. un. in an
explanation of الصَّدَفَتَانِ, voce صَدَفٌ:) and sometimes it means nerves: (see a usage of its pl. voce
صَرْعٌ:) it is a coll. gen. n.:] the n. un. is with ة:
(S, O, TA:) and the pl. is أَعْصَابٌ. (S, Mgh, O,
Msb.) ―
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  The best (in a pl. sense) of a
people or party. (K.) ―
-b3-  See also عُصْبٌ.
عَصِبٌ Flesh, or flesh-meat, having many عَصَب

A party, or company, of men (AZ, S, O, Msb)
who league together to defend one another; (O;
[See also عَصَبَةٌ;]) in number from ten to forty;
(AZ, S, O, Msb;) or, about ten: (IF, Msb:) or
accord. to Akh, a company [of men]; as also
↓ عِصَابَةٌ; having no sing.: (O:) or ↓ the latter,
(S, O, Msb,) or each, (K,) signifies a company,
