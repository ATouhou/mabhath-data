O, K,) or that is put beneath the دلو, (A,) and

K:) or, as some say, a loop in the lower part of
the bucket, inside it, which is tied by a cord or the
like to the upper part of the [rope called] كَرَب

not the main rope,] break, it keeps the bucket
from falling in the well: this is when the bucket
is light: pl. [of pauc.] أَعْنِجَةٌ and [of mult.] عُنُجٌ.

also,] قَوْلٌ لَا عِنَاجَ لَهُ (tropical:)  The support, or foundation, of
the affair; that upon which the affair rests, or

وَالأَمْرُ وَمِلَاكُهُ is erroneously put for وَمِنَ الأَمْرِ
مِلَاكُهُ; as is said in the TA.]) Thus in the
saying, لَا أَدْرِى لِأَمْرِكَ عِنَاجًا (assumed tropical:)  [I know not any
foundation to thine affair]. (O.) And عِنَاجُ
الأَمْرِ إِلَى أَىِ سُفْيَانَ, occurring in a trad., means
