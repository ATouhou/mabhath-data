as in the Mufradát, upon their عريش, (TA,) or
upon the عِرَاش [which may be a pl. of عَرِيشٌ,
like عَرَائِشُ, or perhaps it is a mistranscription for
this last word]: (S: so in two copies:) and in
like manner, اعترش العِنَبُ العَرِيشَ: (L, TA:
[expl. by عَلَاهُ عَلَى العِرَاشِ, which seems to be a
mistake for عَلَا عَلَى العِرِيشِ:]) and اعترشت
القُضْبَانُ عَلَى العَرِيشِ The branches, or shoots,
mounted upon the عريش. (A, TA.)
عَرْشٌ A booth, or shed, or thing constructed for
shade, (مِظَلَّةٌ,) mostly made of canes, or reeds;
(K;) and sometimes, (TA,) made of palm-sticks,
over which is thrown ثُمَام [a species of panic
grass]; (Mgh, TA:) as described by Az, on the
authority of the Arabs; (TA;) and such is
meant by the عَرْش of Moses: (Mgh:) a thing
resembling a house, or tent, made of palm-sticks,
over which is put ثُمَام; as also ↓ عَرِيشٌ: (Msb:)
a booth, or shed, syn. خَيْمَةٌ, (K, TA,) made of
wood and ثمان; (TA;) as also ↓ عَرِيشٌ; (S, A, *
O, K;) and such is meant by the ↓ عَرِيش of
Moses; (A;) and sometimes the ↓ عَرِيش was
made of palm-sticks, with ثُمَام thrown over them:
(TA:) both signify a thing, (S, O,) or a house,
or the like, (K,) used for shade: (S, O, K:) pl.
of the former, عُرُوشٌ (ISd, Mgh, Msb, K) and
عُرُشٌ and أَعْرَاشٌ [which is a pl. of pauc.] and
عِرَشَةٌ: (K:) or عُرُشٌ is pl. of ↓ عَرِيشٌ, (S, ISd,
O, Msb,) not of عَرْشٌ: (ISd:) or it is also pl.
of ↓ عَرِيشٌ: (K:) and عُرُوشٌ is also a pl. of
↓ عُرْشٌ, which is a pl. of ↓ عَرِيشٌ. (L.) Hence
The houses of Mekkeh, (S, A, Mgh, O, Msb,) in
which the needy of its inhabitants dwelt, (Mgh,)
or its ancient houses, (K,) were called العُرُوشُ,
(S, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) and العُرُشُ, (S, Msb,)
and ↓ العُرْشُ; (O, K;) because they were of
poles, or sticks, set up, and shaded over: (S, O,
Msb:) or Mekkeh itself was called ↓ العُرْشُ:
(Az, O, L, K:) or it was called العَرْشُ, with fet-h,
and ↓ العَرِيشُ: (Az, L, K:) and its houses were
called ↓ العُرْشُ, and العُرُوشُ. (K.) And hence,
(S, O, Msb,) the saying in a trad., (S, O,) i. e.,
the saying of Saad, (K, TA,) when he heard that
Mo'áwiyeh forbade the performing conjointly the
greater and minor pilgrimages, (TA,) تَمَتَّعْنَا مَعَ
رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ وَفُلَانٌ كَافِرٌ بِالْعُرُشِ,
(S, O, K, *) or بِالْعُرُوشِ, (S, TA,) i. e., [We performed conjointly the greater and minor pilgrimages with the Apostle of God, (God bless and
save him,)] when such a one, meaning Mo'áwiyeh,
was abiding (O, L, K) in his state of unbelief,
(L,) in Mekkeh; (L, K;) i. e. in the houses
thereof: (O, L:) or, as some say, was hiding
himself in the houses of Mekkeh. (L.) ―
-b2-  A house
[in an absolute sense]; a dwelling, or place of
abode: (Kr, TA:) pl. عُرُشٌ (TA) [and عُرُوشٌ].
―
-b3-  A [building of the kind called] قَصْر. (K.) ―
-b4-
The wood upon which stands the drawer of water:
(K:) or a structure of wood built at the head of
the well, forming a shade: [pl. عُرُوشٌ:] when the
props are pulled away, the عُرُوش fall down.
(TA.) [عَرْشٌ in relation to a well has also
another meaning; which see below.] ―
-b5-  The
wooden thing [or trellis] which serves for the propping of a grape-vine. (TA.) [But this is more
commonly called عَرِيشٌ, q. v.] ―
-b6-  The roof of a
house or the like: (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K:) pl.
عُرُوشٌ. (A.) So in a trad., where a lamp is
mentioned as suspended to the عرش: (O, TA:)
and in another, in which a man relates that he
used, when upon his عرش, to hear the Prophet's
reciting [of the Kur-án]. (TA.) And so it has
been expl. as occurring in the phrase of the Kur
[ii. 261 and xxii. 44], خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا Having
fallen down upon its roofs: meaning that its
walls were standing when their roofs had become
demolished and had fallen to the foundations, and
the walls fell down upon the roofs demolished
before them: (O, TA:) but some consider على
as here meaning عَنْ [from]. (TA.) ―
-b7-  [Hence,
app.,] العَرْشُ is applied to The عَرْش of God,
which is not definable: (A, K:) I'Ab is related
to have said that the كُرْسِىّ is the place of the
feet and the عَرْش is immeasurable: and it is said
in the Mufradát of Er-Rághib that the عَرْش of
God is one of the things which mankind know not
in reality, but only by name; and it is not as the
imaginations of the vulgar hold it to be; [namely,
the throne of God;] for were it so, it would be a
support to Him; not supported; whereas God
saith [in the Kur., xxxv. 39], “Verily God
holdeth the heavens and the earth, lest they
should move from their place; and if they should
move from their place, no one would hold them
after Him: ” or, as some say, it is the highest
sphere; [or the empyrean;] and the كرسىّ is the
sphere of the stars: and they adduce as an indication thereof the saying of Mohammad, that the
seven heavens and earths, by the side of the
كرسىّ, are nought but as a ring thrown down in
a desert land; and such is the كرسىّ with respect
to the عَرْش: and this assertion is mentioned in
the B, but without approval: (TA:) [it appears,
however, to be most commonly accepted:] or a
red sapphire, which glistens with the light of the
Supreme. (A, K.) [Hence the saying,] مِنَ
العَرْشِ إِلَى الفَرْشِ meaning, [From the highest
sphere, or the empyrean, to] the earth. (A.) ―
-b8-
Also The سَرِير [or throne] (S, A, O, Msb, K) of
a king; (S, A, O, K;) the seat of a sultán;
[perhaps as being likened to the عرش of God;
or, more probably, from its being generally surmounted by a canopy; or] because of its height.
(Er-Rághib.) [Hence,] the phrase اِسْتَوَى عَلَى
عَرْشِهِ means He reigned as king. (A, TA.) ―
-b9-
And [hence, also,] Certain stars in advance of
السِّمَاك الأَعْزَل [which is Spica Virginis]; (TA;)
[app. those meant by what here follows;] عَرْشُ
السِّمَاكِ signifies four small stars [app.
γ, δ, ε,
and
η, of Virgo, regarded as the seat of Bootes,
the principal star of which is called السِّمَاكُ الرَّامِحُ,
being described as] beneath العَوَّآء [which is a
name of Bootes and also of the four stars mentioned above], and also called عَجُزُ الأَسَدِ [the
rump of Leo, the figure of which was extended
by the Arabs far beyond the limits which we
assign to it]. (S, O, K.) ―
-b10-  And عَرْشُ الجَوْزَآءِ
[The seat of Orion; applied by our astronomers
to
α of Lepus; but described as] four stars, of
which two are on the fore legs and two on the
hind legs, of Lepus. (Kzw.) ―
-b11-  And عَمْشُ الثَّرَيَّا
Certain stars near الثُّرَيَّا [or the Pleiades]. (T,
TA.) ―
-b12-  عَرْشٌ also signifies The جَمَازَة; (O, K,
TA;) i. e., the bier of a corpse. (O, TA.) And
hence, as some say, the expression in a trad.,
اِهْتَزَّ العَرْشُ لِمَوْتِ سَعْدِ بْنِ مُعَاذٍ, meaning The bier
rejoiced [lit. shook] at the death of Saad Ibn-Mo'ádh; i. e., at carrying him upon it to his
place of burial: (O, K, * TA:) but there are
other explanations, for which see art. هز. (TA.)
―
-b13-  The wood with which a well is cased after it
has been cased with stones (S, O, K) in its lowest
part (S, O) to the height of the stature of a man:
(S, O, K:) pl. عُرُوشٌ. (S, O.) [Another meaning
of the same word in relation to a well has been mentioned before.] ―
-b14-  (assumed tropical:)  The nest of a bird, such as is built
in a tree, (K,) [app. as being likened to a booth.]
―
-b15-  The angle, or corner, or strongest side, syn. رُكْن,
(Ks, Zj, K,) of a house, (Ks, Zj,) or [other] thing:
(K:) pl. عُرُوشٌ. (Ks, Zj.) Accord. to some,
the phrase in the Kur [ii. 261, mentioned above],
خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا, means Empty, and fallen to
ruin upon its أَرْكَان [or angles, &c.]. (Ks, Zj,
O.) ―
-b16-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  The head, or chief, who is the
manager or regulator of the affairs, of a people,
or company of men: (K:) likened to the عَرْش
of a house. (TA.) ―
-b17-  [Hence also,] (assumed tropical:)  The means
of support of a thing, or an affair. (A, O, K.)
Hence the saying, ثُلَّ عَرْشُهُ, (O, K,) meaning
(tropical:)  His means of support became taken away:
(TA:) or he perished: (A:) or he was slain; as
also ↓ ثُلَّ عُرْشُهُ: (IDrd, in M, art. ثل:) or
his might, or power, departed: (TA:) or his
affairs, or state, became weak, and his might, or
power, departed. (S, O. [See also art. ثل.] [For
عَرْشٌ also signifies] ―
-b18-  (tropical:)  Might, or power: (Er-Rághib, K:) regal power; sovereignty; dominion:
(IAar, Er-Rághib, K:) from the same word as
signifying the throne, or seat, of a king. (Er-Rághib.) ―
-b19-  And The protuberant part (S, O, K)
in, (S, O,) or of, (K,) the upper surface of the
foot, (S, O, K,) in which are the toes; (S, O,
TA;) as also ↓ عُرْشٌ: pl. [of pauc.] أَعْرَاشٌ and
[of mult.] عِرَشَةٌ: (O, TA:) and the part between
the عَيْر [or prominent bone] and the toes, of the
upper surface of the foot; as also ↓ عُرْشٌ: (Ibn-
'Abbád, O, K:) pls. the same as last mentioned
above: (K:) or ↓ عُرْشٌ signifies the upper surface
of the foot; and its lower surface is called the
أَخْمَص. (IAar.)
عُرْشٌ, both as a sing. and as a pl.: see عَرْشٌ,
last sentence, in three places: ―
-b2-  and the same
paragraph, first and second sentences, in four
places: and see ثُلَّ عُرْشُهُ in the latter part of the
same paragraph. ―
-b3-  العُرْشَانِ signifies Two oblong
portions of flesh in the two sides of the neck, [app.
the two sterno-mastoid muscles,] (S, A, O, K, TA,)
between which are the vertebræ [of the neck]:
(TA:) or in the base of the neck: (K:) or the
base [itself] of the neck: so in the phrase ثَلَّ
عُرْشَيْهِ: (IDrd and M in art ثل, q. v.:) or the
أَخْدَعَانِ [or two branches of the occipital artery],
(TA, as from the K, [in which I do not find it,])
which are (TA) [in] the two places of the cuppingvessels: (K, TA:) or the أَخْدَعَانِ are in the
عُرْشَانِ: (Ibn-'Abbád, O:) or the عُرْش is a vein
in the base of the neck: (Th, O:) or the عُرْشَانِ
are [app. the two greater cornua of the os hyoides,
which forms a support to the tongue; two bones
in the لَهَاة [meaning furthest part of the mouth],
which erect the tongue. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.) It
is related in a trad., respecting the slaying of
Aboo-Jahl, that he said to Ibn-Mes'ood, خُذْ
سَيْفِى فَاجْتَزَّ بِهِ رَأْسِي مِنْ عُرْشَيَّ [Take thou my
sword, and cut with it my head from my عُرْشَانِ].
(O, TA.) ―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  The ear: (K:) or (assumed tropical:)  the two
ears: because near to the عُرْشَانِ [properly so
called]: hence the saying, نَفَثَ فِى عُرْشَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  He
spoke secretly to him, or with him. (As, A, O.)
―

the structure made for a grape-vine to rise upon

O, K,) but not [exactly the same as] it, made for

of a vine: (Er-Rághib:) or ↓ عَرِيشَةٌ, with ة, is

which signifies the same as هَوَادِجُ. (ISh, A.) ―
