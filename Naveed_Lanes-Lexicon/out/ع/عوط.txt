عوط1
عَاطَتْ, aor. تَعُوطُ, (S, K,) and تَعِيطُ, (K,)
inf. n. عَوْطٌ (M, TA) and, accord. to some,
↓ عُوطَطٌ, which others hold to be a pl. of عَائِطٌ,
(A'Obeyd, S,) but Sb holds it to be a subst.
having the sense of an inf. n., (TA,) and عَيْطٌ and
عِيَاطٌ, (K,) She (a camel) did not conceive in the
first year after having been covered: nor in the
next following year: (S:) or i. q. ↓ اعتاطت and
↓ تعوّطت and ↓ تعيّطت, (K,) which (or the first
and second of which, IDrd, O) signify she (a
camel, IDrd, S, M, A, O, K, and a woman, A, K)
did not conceive for several years, (Lth, IDrd, S, O,
K,) without being barren; (Lth, K;) and sometimes
this is caused by the abundance of her fat: (Lth,
S:) the last three verbs also signify, (the first
of them accord. to the K, and the other two also
accord to the TA,) she (a camel) did not conceive,
having been covered; (K, TA;) or although her
womb had attained to maturity. (TA. [See also
اعتاصت, in art. عوص.]) ―
-b2-  [Hence the saying,]
الأَذْهَانُ ↓ هٰذَا زَمَانٌ عَقُمَتْ فِيهِ القَرَائِحُ وَاعْتَاطَتِ
اللَّوَاقِحُ (assumed tropical:)  [This is a time in which the powers of
elicitation have become unproductive, and the pregnant intellectual faculties have become fruitless].
(A, TA.) [Hence also,] الأَمْرُ ↓ اعتاط (assumed tropical:)  The affair
was, or became, difficult; or difficult and intricate; or impossible; i. q. اعتاص. (S, O.)

عُوطَةٌ The quality denoted by the epithet عَائِطٌ,
in a she-camel; as also ↓ عُوطَطٌ and ↓ عُوطُطٌ and
عُيْطَطٌ [perhaps a mistake for عِيطَطٌ]. (TA.)
عُوطَطٌ and عُوطُطٌ: see 1, and عُوطَةٌ, and عَائِطٌ,
this last in two places.
عَائِطٌ A she-camel not conceiving in the first
year after having been covered: (Ks, Az, S, O:)
or a she-camel, (Lth, K,) and a woman, (K,) not
conceiving for several years, without being barren;
(Lth, K;) as also ↓ مُعْتَاطٌ: (Lth, IAth, O, * TA:)
and a she-camel not conceiving when covered;
(K;) as also ↓ مُعْتَاطٌ, or ↓ مُعْتَاطَةٌ: (accord. to
different copies of the K:) or not conceiving when
her womb has attained to maturity: (TA:) ↓ مُعْتَاطٌ
is also applied to a ewe or she-goat, as meaning
not conceiving, by reason of the abundance of her
fat; (IAth;) and occurs in a trad., so applied,
(S, IAth,) and expl. as signifying اَلَّتِى لَمْ تَلِدْ
وَقَدْ حَانَ وِلَادُهَا; but by this is app. meant that
has not conceived, although the time for her conceiving has come: (IAth:) the pl. of عَائِطٌ is عُوطٌ,
(Ks, S, M, O, K,) which is also applied to women,
and she-goats, (M,) and عِيطٌ (Ks, S, O, K) and
عُيَّطٌ (M, O, K) and عَوَائِطُ (TA) and ↓ عُوطَطٌ
[which is irregular, like حُولَلٌ,] (Ks, S, O, K)
and عَوْطَطٌ (accord. to the CK) and عُوطُطٌ, (K,)
but this is a dial. var. of عُوطَطٌ accord. to those
who assert it to be an inf. n., (As, O, TA,) for
some assert this last to be an inf. n., not a pl.,
and in like manner حُولَلٌ, (A'Obeyd, S, O,) but
Sb holds it to be a subst. in the sense of an inf. n.,
originally عُيْطَطٌ. (L, TA.) عَائِطُ عِيطٍ and عَائِطُ
عُوطٍ and ↓ عَائِطُ عُوطَطٍ (S, O, K) have an intensive
signification, (K,) Not conceiving in the first year
after having been covered, nor in the next following year; like حَائِلُ حُولٍ and حَائِلُ حُولَلٍ. (S,
O.) [عِيطٌ is also pl. of أَعْيَطُ, which see in
art. عيط.]
مُعْتَاطٌ, and with ة: see عَائِطٌ, in four places.
The author of the K has confounded the words
belonging to this art. with those belonging to art.
عيط. (TA.)
