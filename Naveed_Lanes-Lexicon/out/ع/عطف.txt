عَطَفَ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) aor.
عَطِفَ, (O,
K,) inf. n. عُطُوفٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) or عَطْفٌ, (O,
TA,) He, or it, (a man, S, O, or a thing, Msb,)
inclined; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) or bent: (MF,
TA:) and ↓ انعطف also has the former meaning,
(Mgh, Msb, * TA,) as in the saying انعطف نَحْوَهُ
i. e. he, or it, inclined towards him, or it; (TA;)
[or the latter meaning;] or it became inclined,
(Msb,) or became bent, (S, * O, Msb, K,) or both,
(TA,) as quasi-pass. of عَطَفَهُ; (S, O, Msb, TA;)
and ↓ تعطّف likewise has both of these meanings,
as quasi-pass. of عطّفهُ, or [signifies it became
much inclined and bent, for] عطّف is with teshdeed
to denote muchness. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (MF,
TA,) عَطَفَ عَلَيْهِ, (S, Mgh, MA, O, K,) [aor. as
above,] inf. n. عَطْفٌ; (MA, MF, TA;) and
عليه ↓ تعطّف; (S, MA, O, K;) [and ↓ انعطف
عليه;] (tropical:)  He was, or became, favourably inclined
towards him; or affectionate, or kind, to him;
(MA, PS;) he regarded him, or treated him,
with mercy or pity or compassion; (MA, Mgh;)
because in mercy, or pity, or compassion, is an
inclining towards its object; (Mgh;) i. q. أَشْفَقَ
عَلَيْهِ; (S, O, K;) and وَصَلَهُ, and بَرَّهُ. (TA in
explanation of the second.) And عَطَفَتْ عَلَى
وَلَدِهَا, aor. as above, inf. n. عَطْفٌ, said of a she
camel, (assumed tropical:)  She became favourably inclined, or compassionate, towards her young one, and yielded
her milk; (Msb;) and عَلَيْهِ ↓ تعطّفت [signifies
the same, or she was made to incline to him, or to
affect him]. (M in art. رأم, &c) ―
-b3-  عَطَفَ عَلَيْهِ
also signifies He turned, or returned, against
him: (S:) or he charged, or made an assault or

TA;) as also ↓ استعطفهُ: (Mgh:) or he bent it,
or doubled it, or folded it: (Msb:) or it signifies
also he bent it: and ↓ عطّفهُ likewise, inf. n.
تَعْطِيفٌ, has both of these meanings: (TA:) or
this latter verb is with teshdeed to denote muchness [of the action], or multiplicity [of the objects]: (S, O, TA:) you say, عَطَفْتُ العُودَ (S) I
bent [or inclined] the stick, or piece of wood:
(MA, PS:) and العِيدَانَ ↓ عَطَّفْتُ [I bent, or inclined, the sticks, or pieces of wood]: (S, O:) and

as in جَآءَ أَخُوكَ زَيْدٌ; and عَطْفُ النَّسَقِ the ordinal
adjunction, as in جَآءَ زَيْدٌ وَعَمْرٌو: (in each of
which instances the latter noun is termed ↓ مَعْطُوفٌ;
and the former noun عَلَيْهِ ↓ مَعْطُوفٌ:) and hence,
حَرْفُ عَطْفٍ, meaning a particle of adjunction; or
what we commonly call a conjunction; (as وَ
and ثُمَّ, &c.;) also termed ↓ حَرْفٌ عَاطِفٌ an adjunctive particle.]

also, and عُطُوفٌ. (TA.) Hence the phrase, هُمْ
أَلْيَنُ عِطْفًا [They are more pliant, or pliable; properly as meaning flexible, supple, lithe, or limber;

however, it is certainly not used as applied to
what here immediately follows,]) A tree to which
the حَبْلَة [i. e. grape-vine, or branch of a grapevine,] clings; (ISh, O, K;) and so ↓ عِطْفَةٌ, (K,)
or thus as written in the “ Book of Plants ” by
AHn, who says that it is thus called because of
its bending and twining upon trees: (O: [but
this remark seems evidently to show that he
means thereby one of the plants mentioned below
voce عِطْفَةٌ or voce عَطَفَةٌ, or perhaps what here
follows:]) IB says that the عَطْفَة is the لَبْلَاب
[dolichos lablab of Linn.]; so called because of
its twining upon trees: (TA:) [and this, or what
will be found mentioned voce عَطَفَةٌ below, may
be meant in the following verse:] a poet says,
تَلَبَّسَ حُبُّهَا بِدَمِى وَلَحْمِى
تَلَبُّسَ عَطْفَةٍ بِفُرُوعِ ضَالِ
[The love of her mingled with, and clung to, my

and has no leaves nor branches, fed upon by the
oxen [app. meaning the wild oxen,] (K, TA,) but
injurious to them: (TA:) some of its عُرُوق [app.

kinds called] a رِدَآء (S, O, K) and a طَيْلَسَان, and
any garment that is worn like as is the رِدَآء, (TA,)
and the former also signifies an إِزَار: (K:) the
two words are like إِزَارٌ and مِئْزَرٌ, &c.: and the
ردآء is said to be called عطاف because it falls
against the two sides of the man's neck, which
are termed his عِطْفَانِ: the pl. [of pauc.] of عِطَافٌ
is أَعْطِفَةٌ and [of mult.] عُطُفٌ and عُطُوفٌ; (TA;)
and عُطْفٌ [also] is a pl. of عِطَافٌ as meaning an

which is assigned no fine and no gain; (O, K;)
it is one of the three أَغْفَال; and is called عطوف
because it returns into every رِبَابَة with which one
