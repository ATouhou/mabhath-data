one says يَوْمٌ بَارِدٌ, (Fr, O,) or like لَيْلٌ نَائِمٌ; the
meaning being, A day in which the wind blows
violently, or vehemently: (S, O:) this is the meaning in the phrase فِى يَوْمٍ عَاصِفٍ (Fr, O, K) in
the Kur [xiv. 21]: or this phrase may mean
فِى يَوْمٍ عَاصِفِ الرِّيحِ [in a day violent, or vehement, in respect of the wind], because the wind is
mentioned in the former part of the sentence.
