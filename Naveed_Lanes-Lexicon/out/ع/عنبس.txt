عنبسعَنْبَسٌ The lion; (O, K;) as also ↓ عُنَابِسٌ: (K:
but in the O it is said, when you designate the
lion, you say عَنْبَسٌ and عَنَابِسُ: [as though, by
the latter, the pl. were meant: but it is probably
a mistranscription for عُنَابِسٌ:]) or the lion from
whom other lions flee: (TA in art. عبس:) when
you particularize him by a [proper] name, you
say ↓ عَنْبَسَةُ, [i. e. The lion,] making it imperfectly
decl.; like as you say أُسَامَةُ. (O, K.) It is mentioned by Lth and Az among quadriliteral-radical
words: Hishám says, I know not whether it be
a subst. or an epithet: and A'Obeyd says, it is
from العُبُوسُ; and if so, it is of the measure فَنْعَلٌ:
(O:) but 'Ikrimeh is related to have said that the
lion is called ↓ عَنْبَسَة in the Abyssinian language.
(TA voce قَسْوَرَةٌ.)
