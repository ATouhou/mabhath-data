عبقرعَبْقَرٌ: see the following paragraph, in two
places.
عَبْقَرِىٌّ a rel. n. from ↓ عَبْقَرٌ, a place which the
Arabs assert to be of the lands of the Jinn, or
Genii: (S, O, Msb:) or a certain place, (K,)
in the desert, (TA,) abounding with Jinn: (K:)
AO says, We have not found any one who
knows where this country is, or when it existed.
(TA.) Hence it is applied as an epithet to anything wondered at, or admired, for the skilfulness
which it exhibits, or the excellence of its manufacture, and its strength: (S, O:) or to any
work great in estimation, and fine, and delicate:
(Msb:) it is both sing. and pl.; and the fem. is
عَبْقَرِيَّةٌ: you say, ثِيَابٌ عَبْقَرِيَّةٌ [Cloths, or garments, of admirable manufacture]: (S, O:) [or
such are so called in relation to a certain town;
for] ↓ عَبْقَرٌ is also a town (M, K) in El-Yemen,
(M,) or, accord. to the Moajam, in El-Jezeereh,
in which cloths or garments, and carpets, are
variegated, or figured, (TA,) and of which the
cloths or garments are of the utmost beauty.
(K.) ―
-b2-  And A kind of carpets, (S, O, K,)
variously dyed and figured: upon such the
Prophet used to prostrate himself when he
prayed: (S, O:) as also ↓ عَبَاقِرِىٌّ: (K:) and
some read عَبَاقِرِىّ in the Kur lv. 76: (S, O:) as
pl. of عَبْقَرِىٌّ: (TA:) but this is a mistake; for
a rel. n. has no such pl; (S;) unless it be from
a sing. n. of a pl. form, like حَضَاجِرِىٌّ from
حَضَاجِرُ, and so be a rel. n. from عَبَاقِرُ: so say
the skilful grammarians, Kh and Sb and Ks: Az
mentions the reading ↓ عَبَاقَرِىّ, with fet-h to the
ق; as though it were a rel. n. from عَبَاقَرٌ: Fr
says that عَبْقَرِىٌّ signifies thick [carpets of the
kind called] طَنَافِسَ: and also silk brocade; syn.
دِيبَاجٌ: Kt, that it signifies what are called زَرَابِىّ:
Sa'eed Ibn-Jubeyr, that it signifies excellent زرابىّ:
(TA:) the n. un. is عَبْقَرِيَّةٌ. (Fr, TA.) ―
-b3-  Also
Good, or excellent; applied to an animal, and to
a jewel. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Perfect, or complete; applied
to anything. (K.) ―
-b5-  A pure, unmixed, lie;
(O, K, * TA;) that has no truth mixed with it.
(O, TA.) ―
-b6-  A lord, or chief, (O, K,) of men:
(TA:) or (TA, in the K, “and ”) one who has
none above him: and strong. (K.) You say
of a strong man, هٰذَا عَبْقَرِىُّ قَوْمٍ: (S, O:) or
this means This is a chief, or lord, of a people:
(As, on the authority of 'Amr Ibn-El-'Alà:)
and in a trad. it is said that the Prophet
related a dream, mentioning 'Omar, and said,
فَلَمْ أَرَ عَبْقَرِيًّا يَفْرِى فَرِيَّهُ [And I have not seen a
chief of a people do his wonderful deeds]. (S, *
O, TA.) ―
-b7-  It is also applied as an epithet denoting superlativeness [of any quality]. (TA.)
They even said ظُلْمٌ عَبْقَرِىٌّ [Excessive, or extreme, wrongdoing]. (S, O.)
عَبَاقِرِىٌّ and عَبَاقَرِىٌّ: see the preceding paragraph.
