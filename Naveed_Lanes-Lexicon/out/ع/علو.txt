عَلَا, (Msb, K,) aor. يَعْلُو, (Msb,) inf. n. عُلُوٌّ;
(Msb, K;) and عَلِىَ; and ↓ تعلّى [which last
see also below]; (K;) It (a thing, Msb) was,
or became, high, elevated, or lofty; (Msb, K; *)
syn. اِرْتَفَعَ; (Msb;) and so ↓ تعالى: (S, K:) or
you say, عَلَا فِى المَكَانِ [it was, or became, high,
or elevated, in place], aor. يَعْلُو, inf. n. عُلُوٌّ: (S:)
and عَلِىَ فِى الشَّرَفِ [(assumed tropical:)  he was, or became, high, or
elevated, or exalted, in dignity, or nobility], (S,
Mgh,) with kesr, (S,) aor. يَعْلَى, inf. n. عَلَآءٌ; (S,
Mgh;) and also عَلَا, with fet-h, aor. يَعْلَى: a
poet says,
لَمَّا عَلَا كَعْبُكَ لِى عَلِيتُ
[(assumed tropical:)  When thy nobility became exalted to me, I
became exalted]; thus combining the two dial.
vars.: (S:) or you say, عَلِىَ فِى المَكَارِمِ [(assumed tropical:)  he
was, or became, eminent in generous, or honourable, actions or qualities], inf. n. عَلَآءٌ [in some
copies of the K عَلًا]; (Msb, K;) and عَلَا, inf. n.
عُلُوٌّ; (K;) and thus the two verbs are used in
the saying of the poet cited above: (TA:) and
↓ استعلى, said of a man, signifies the same as
عَلَا. (S.) [Hence,] عَلَتِ الشَّمْسُ The sun became
high; as also ↓ اِعْتَلَت: (Nawádir el-Aaráb, TA
in art. دلك:) and [hence,] عَلَا النَّهَارُ The day became advanced, the sun being somewhat high; syn.
اِرْتَفَعَ [q. v.]; as also ↓ اعتلى and ↓ استعلى. (K.)
―
-b2-  عَلَا فِى المَكَانِ, inf. n. عُلُوٌّ, signifies [also] He ascended the place, or upon the place; syn. صَعِدَ: and
عَلَوْتُ عَلَى الجَبَلِ and عَلَوْتُ أَعْلَاهُ are syn. [as meaning I ascended the mountain, or upon the mountain,
or upon the top, or highest part, thereof]: and عَلَوْتُهُ
and عَلَوْتُ فِيهِ signify I ascended it; syn. رَقِيتُ
فِيهِ. (Msb.) عَلَاهُ (S, Msb, K, TA) and عَلَا بِهِ,
(K, TA, [in the CK علّاه وبه is put for عَلَاهُ وَبِهِ,])
and ↓ استعلاهُ, (S, K, TA,) and ↓ اعتلاهُ, (S,) and
↓ اِعْلَوْلَاهُ, and ↓ اعلاهُ, and ↓ علّاه, (K, TA,) this
last [for which the CK has عالاهُ] being with
teshdeed, (TA,) and ↓ عالاهُ and بِهِ ↓ عالى, (K,
TA, [in the CK عالَّاهُ وبه,]) are syn., (S, K,) signifying He ascended it, or upon it; (K; [in the
CK صَعَّدَهُ, and so in my MS. copy of the K, but
in other copies صَعِدَهُ, which is certainly the right
reading;]) whether the object be a mountain or a
beast: (TA:) [or] you say, عَلَا الدَّابَّةَ He
mounted the beast; (K, TA;) and in like manner,
anything: (TA:) and عَلَى السَّطْحَ, aor. يَعْلِيهِ;
(K, TA;) but in the M عَلِىَ السَّطْحَ, i. e., like
رَضِىَ; (TA;) inf. n. عَلْىٌ (K, TA) and عِلْىٌ
(TA, and so accord. to some copies of the K,)
and عُلِىٌّ; (TA, and so accord. to other copies of
the K instead of عِلْىٌ;) He ascended upon the flat
house-top; syn. صَعِدَهُ. (K, TA.) ―
-b3-  [عَلَاهُ signifies also He, or it, was, or became, upon it, or
over it: and it came, or arose, upon it; overlay
it; was, or became, superincumbent, or supernatant, upon it; or overspread it; as scum, and
rust, &c. And It lay on him as a burden.
Hence,] one says, مَا سَأَلْتُكَ مَا يَعْلُوكَ ظَهْرًا i. e.
[(assumed tropical:)  I did not ask, or demand, of thee, what would
lie as a burden on thy back; or] what would be
onerous, burdensome, oppressive, or troublesome, to
thee. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And [hence also] عَلَاهُ It over-
topped it, rose above it, or exceeded it in height.
(TA in art. دصر.) [And in like manner, ↓ استعلى
عَلَيْهِ It became elevated above it.] ―
-b5-  And عَلَوْتُهُمْ
بِالشَّرَفِ and بِالجَمَالِ [(assumed tropical:)  I was, or became, superior
to them in nobility and in goodliness]. (S in art.
فرع.) ―
-b6-  And عَلَاهُ [(assumed tropical:)  He had, or gained, ascendency over him, or it; as also عَلَا عَلَيْهِ and
عليه ↓ استعلى: and] (assumed tropical:)  he overcame him; or had,
or gained, the mastery over him; (S, Msb, TA;)
and subdued him; (Msb;) namely, his opponent,
or adversary; as also ↓ استعلاهُ: and in like manner, عَلَا حَاجَتَهُ and ↓ استعلاها (assumed tropical:)  he gained the
mastery over the object of his want: and ↓ اعتلى
الشَّىْءَ (assumed tropical:)  he prevailed against the thing, or had
power over it, and overcame it; and عَلَا لِلشَّىْءِ,
aor. يَعْلُو, (assumed tropical:)  he was, or became, able to do, or
accomplish, or to bear, the thing. (TA.) عَلَا
بِالأَمْرِ means اِضْطَلَعَ بِهِ وَاسْتَقَلَّ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He had
strength, or power, sufficient for the affair, and
had absolute control over it]: (S: [so in one of
my copies: the other has اِطَّلَعَ, which I find also
in the PS and in my copy of the TA; and which
is allowed by some, but disallowed by others, in
the sense of اِضْطَلَعَ, as is shown voce مُضْطَلِعٌ:])
a poet says,
فَاعْمِدْ لِمَا تَعْلُو فَمَا لَكَ بِالَّذِى
لَا تَسْتَطِيعُ مِنَ الأُمُورِ يَدَانِ
[Then aim thou at that for which thou hast sufficient strength, or power, and over which thou hast
absolute control: (بِهِ being understood after تعلو:)
for what object hast thou in meddling with that
which a pair of hands cannot accomplish, of
affairs?]. (S.) [And hence, perhaps,] one says
to him who possesses much property, اعل به i. e.
ابق بعده [app. اُعْلُ بِهِ and اِبْقَ بَعْدَهُ, as though
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Have thou ability to consume it, and
so survive thou it; like as one says to him who
puts on a new garment, أَبْلِ (see 4 in art. بلو)]:
or [perhaps a mistake for “ and ”] it is [virtually]
a prayer for his continuance in life. (TA.) ―
-b7-
عَلَوْتُ عَلَى فُلَانٍ الرِّيحَ means I was [or went] on
the windward side of such a one: and one says,
لَا تَعْلُ الرِّيحَ عَلَى الصَّيْدِ فَيَرَاحَ رِيحَكَ وَيَنْفِرَ [i. e.
Go not thou on the windward side of the game,
lest it scent thy odour, and take fright and flee].
(TA.) ―
-b8-  عَلَوْتُهُ بِالسَّيْفِ means I smote him [with
the sword; or, more properly, I set upon him
therewith]. (S, TA.) And [in like manner] one
says, عَلَاهُ بِالشَّتْمِ وَالضَّرْبِ [(assumed tropical:)  He set upon him, or
assailed him, or overcame him, with reviling and
beating]. (S and M in art. ثول, &c.) ―
-b9-  عَلَا فِى
الأَرْضِ, (S, TA,) inf. n. عُلُوٌّ, (S,) signifies (assumed tropical:)  He
exalted, or magnified, himself, [in the earth,] or
behaved proudly, insolently, or exorbitantly. (S, *
TA.) And [in like manner] لَا تَعْلُوا عَلَى اللّٰهِ, in
the Kur xliv. 18, (assumed tropical:)  Exalt not, or magnify not,
yourselves against God; or behave not proudly,
&c. (Bd, Jel.) ―
-b10-  عَلَا عَنْهُ [lit. signifies It rose

him. (TA.) ―

-b12-  عَلَا بِهِ as
syn. with أَعْلَاهُ: see expl. with the latter below.

علّاهُ: see 4. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, عَلَّيْتُ
بِهِ عَلَى البَعِيرِ [I raised it, and put it, upon the
camel]: (S:) [and so ↓ عَالَيْتُهُ; as in a verse cited
voce رَائِحٌ, in art. روح; in which, and in the present art., it is cited in the S and TA: and ↓ عَالَبْتُ
بِهِ; as in a verse cited voce إِلَى in the sense of
مِنْ, in art. الو:] and عَلَىَّ ↓ عَالِ means اِحْمِلْ
[i. e. Put thou upon me such a thing to be carried
by me; or load thou me]. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  And عَلَّيْتُ
الحَبْلَ, inf. n. تَعْلِيَةٌ, I raised the cord to its proper place in respect of the channel of the sheave,
and in respect of the [main] well-rope. (S.) ―
-b4-
And علّى الدَّلْوَ, inf. n. as above, He raised the
bucket from a stone projecting in the lower part
of the casing of a well [and impeding its ascent];
he having descended the well for that purpose: [or
simply he raised the filled bucket; for] some say
that ↓ المُعَلِّىsignifies he who raises the filled
bucket; i. e., who draws water thereby. (TA.)
―
-b5-  And علّى المَتَاعَ عَنِ الدَّابَّةِ He put down the
goods, or furniture and utensils, from the beast:
[app. because he who does so lifts them off the
beast:] (K, TA:) أَعْلَاهُ in this sense is disapproved. (TA.) ―
-b6-  See also 1, former half. ―
-b7-
And see Q. Q. 1.

مُعَالَاةٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The vying, competing, or contending for superiority, in highness, loftiness, elevation, or eminence. (KL.) You say, عَالَاهُ, meaning سَامَاهُ. (M in art. سمو. [See 3 in that art. in
two places.]) ―
-b2-  See 4, in two places. ―
-b3-  عُولِىَ,
said of clarified butter, and of the fat of anything
having fatness, means It was wrought (صُنِعَ [app.
over a fire]) until it rose in the operation. (TA.)
―
-b4-  عَالَوْا نَعِيَّهُ (assumed tropical:)  They manifested the announcement
of his death: (K, TA:) [as though meaning they
raised the report of his death:] one should not
say أَعْلَوْهُ nor عَلَّوْهُ. (TA.) ―
-b5-  See 2, in three
places. ―
-b6-  عَالَتِ البَيْقُورَ, occurring in a verse of
Umeiyeh Ibn-Abi-s-Salt, is mentioned and explained in the S in this art. and in art. عول: see
the latter art. [to which it seems more properly to
belong]. ―
-b7-  See 1, former half, in two places. ―
-b8-
عَالِ عَنِّى Remove thou, or go thou away or aside,
from me; as also عَنِّى ↓ أَعْلِ; (S, TA;) for
which latter, أَعْلِ عَنِّجْ occurs in a trad. respecting the slaughter of Abu-Jahl; and عَنِّى ↓ اُعْلُ
with the conjunctive ا is a dial. var. of أَعْلِ عَنِّى
with the disjunctive ا mentioned by Fr. (TA.)
―
-b9-  [Hence,] one says, عَنَّا ↓ أَعْلِ and عَالِ [i. e. and
عَالِ عَنَّا], meaning (assumed tropical:)  Seek the object of thy want
at the hands of other than us (عِنْدَ غَيْرِنَا), for we
are not able to accomplish it. (TA.) ―
-b10-  And عالى
and ↓ اعلى signify He came to the 'Áliyeh of Nejd,

اعلاهُ He (a man, Msb) elevated it (i. e. a
thing, Msb); or made it high, or lofty; (Msb,
K;) as also ↓ علّاهُ, (K,) with teshdeed, (TA,)
and بِهِ ↓ عَلَا [without teshdeed]: (K:) it is [also]
said of God, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He elevated, or exalted,
him; and ↓ عالاهُ is like it [in meaning]: (S:)
and بِفُلَانٍ ↓ عَالَيْتُ signifies the same as أَعْلَيْتُهُ
[(assumed tropical:)  I elevated, or exalted, such a one; as also, app.,
(see 4 in art. ظهر,) أَعْلَيْتُ بِفُلَانٍ]. (Ham p. 175.)

He, or it, was, or became, high, elevated, or lofty,
gently, or leisurely. (S, K.) ―

passed forth, (Mgh,) from her state of impurity
consequent upon childbirth; (S, Mgh, K;) as also
↓ تَعَالَتْ; (Mgh; and TA in art. عل;) and so
تَعَالَّتْ, as well as تَعَلَّلَتْ: (K and TA in that art.:)
or مِنْ مَرَضِهَا from her disease: (K:) or you say
of a woman, تعلّت من نفاسها meaning [as above
or] she became pure from the effects of her childbirth: (TA:) and of a man you say, تعلّى مِنْ
عِلَّتِهِ (S, TA) he recovered from his disease. (TA.)

تعالى: see 1, first sentence. ―
-b2-  Addressing
a man, (S, Msb,) using the imperative form, you
say, تَعَالَ, (S, Msb, K,) with fet-h to the ل, (S,
K,) originally meaning Be thou elevated, (S,
Msb,) and said by a man in a high place in calling
a man in a low place; (Msb;) then, by reason
of frequency of usage, employed in the sense of
هَلُمَّ [meaning Come thou], (S, Msb,) absolutely,
whether the place of the person called be high or
low or on the same level; so that it is originally
applied to denote a particular meaning, and then
used in a general meaning: (Msb:) and to a
woman one says, تَعَالَىْ; (S, K;) and to two
women, (S,) or two persons, (TA,) تَعَالَيَا; (S,
TA;) and to a pl. number of men, تَعَالَوْا; (Msb,
TA;) and to a pl. number of women, تَعَالَيْنَ;
(S, Msb, TA;) and sometimes the ل is pronounced with damm in the pl. masc., and with
kesr in the fem.; whence El-Hasan El-Basree
read, [in the Kur iii. 57,] قُلْ يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ تَعَالُوا
[Say thou, O people of the Scripture, come ye,
the usual reading being تَعَالَوْا], for the sake of
congeniality with the و: (Msb, TA:) it is not
allowable to say تَعَالَيْتُ [as meaning I came],
nor to use the prohibitive form; (S;) but one
says, (thus accord. to several copies of the S,)
or nor does one say, (thus accord. to one of
my copies of the S, [and accord. to the TA, in
which it is said that the verb is not used otherwise than in the imperative form,]) قَدْ تَعَالَيْتُ
[as meaning I have come], and إِلَى أَىِّ شَىْءٍ أَتَعَالَى
[as meaning To what thing shall I come? like as
one says, إِلَامَ أَهَلُمَّ]. (S.) ―
-b3-  [تعالى signifies also
(assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, exalted, or extolled: and
(assumed tropical:)  he exalted himself: and in both of these senses
it is often followed by عَنْ as syn. with عَلَى, denoting superiority: you say, تعالى فُلَانٌ عَنْ كَذَا,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one was, or became, exalted
above such a thing; or simply, was, or became,
above it, i. e. too elevated in character for it: and
also, exalted himself above such a thing; or held
himself above it.] Said of God, in the Kur
xx. 113 [and in other instances therein], it means
[(assumed tropical:)  Exalted, or supremely exalted, is He] in his
essence and his attributes, above the created
beings. (Bd.) [But in common speech, it is
generally used as an ejaculation of praise, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Exalted or extolled, or supremely exalted or
extolled, be He, or his greatness or majesty or
glory, or his name; or acknowledged be his absolute supremacy. And the common expression
(used in citing words of the Kur-án) قَالَ تَعَالَى
means (assumed tropical:)  He saith, or hath said, exalted or extolled, or supremely exalted or extolled, be He;
&c.] ―

إِعْتَلَوَ see 1, in two places as trans.: ―
-b2-  and also
in two places as intrans.
-A2-  [It may also be used
for, or in the sense of, اِئتَلَى, as meaning He fell
short in an affair: see its part. n.]
10
إِسْتَعْلَوَ see 1, in seven places. [The inf. n. اِسْتِعْلَآءٌ,
properly denotes Superiority that is perceptible by
sense: and tropically, such as is ideal, or perceived by the intellect: see عَلَى, below.] ―
-b2-  One
says also, هٰذِهِ الكَلِمَةُ تَسْتَعْلِى لِسَانِى, meaning
[(assumed tropical:)  This word, or sentence,] is often current upon
my tongue. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And اِسْتَعْلَى عَلَى الغَايَةِ,
said of a horse in the contending to outstrip in a
race, means (assumed tropical:)  He reached the goal. (TA.)

Q. Q. 1
عَلْوَنَ الكِتَابَ, (S, K,) inf. n. عَلْوَنَةٌ and
عُلْوَانٌ, (K,) i. q. عَنْوَنَهُ [He put a superscription,
or title, to the book, or writing; or he wrote the
superscription, or title, thereof]; (S, K;) as also
الكِتَابَ ↓ عَلَّى; (K;) which latter is the more
agreeable with analogy. (TA.) [See also Q. Q. 1
in arts. عن and عنو.]
مِنْ عَلُ: see the next paragraph. It also signifies, simply, Above him or it; or in the higher,
or highest, part of him or it: thus in a hemistich
cited voce تَحْت. (Mughnee.) [In all cases,] عَلُ
is determinate, and indecl., with damm for its
invariable termination: (Mughnee, TA:) [for it
is regarded as a prefixed noun of which the complement is to be understood as to the meaning
but not as to the letter:] in the saying of Ows,
كَغِرْقِئِ بَيْضٍ كَنَّهُ القَيْضُ مِنْ عَلُو
[Like the thin pellicle of eggs, which the shell covers
above], the و [in عَلُو] is augmentative, being
added to render the rhyme unrestricted: (S,
TA:) and in the instance of مِنْ عَلُهْ, likewise
ending a verse, the ه is that of pausation: for if
عَلُ were [really] a prefixed noun, it would not be
thus indecl. (Mughnee, TA.)
أَتَيْتُهُ مِنْ عَلِ, (S, * K,) whence the saying of
Imra-el-Keys cited in the first paragraph of art.
حط, (S, Mughnee, TA,) and ↓ مِنْ عَلُ, [respecting which see the next preceding paragraph,]
and ↓ مِنْ عَلَا, (S, K,) of which a verse cited
voce نَاشَ in art. نوش is an ex., (S, TA,) and
↓ مِنع عَالٍ, signify the same, (S, Mughnee, K,)
i. e. مِنْ فَوْقٍ; (K;) [which, with أَتَيْتُهُ preceding
it, means I came to him, or it, from above; and
(assumed tropical:)  I overcame, or subdued, him, or it; for] اتاه من
فوق and من علو [app. ↓ من عَلْوٍ (see عَلْوٌ below,)
tropically used,] means قَهَرَهُ; (Ham p. 128;) [but
the former is here meant in many, if not in all,
instances, as is shown by what follows;] and [in
like manner] one says, ↓ أَتَيْتُهُ مِنْ مُعَالٍ; [whence]
Dhu-r-Rummeh says,
وَنَغَضَانُ الرّحْلِ مِنْ مُعَالِ
[And the shaking of the camel's saddle in the
upper part]. (S, TA.) عَلِ in مِنْ عَلِ is indeterminate [in itself] and decl. [as being a prefixed
noun of which the complement is to be understood
as to the meaning and as to the letter; thus differing from عَلُ in مِنْ عَلُ: if the complement
were not to be understood either as to the letter
or as to the meaning, one would say مِنْ عَلٍ,
originally مِنْ عَلْوٍ]. (TA.) One says also أَتَيْتُهُ
مِنْ عَلِ الدَّارِ, [thus in several copies of the S,
from which one of my copies deviates by erroneously substituting عَلى for عَلِ,] with kesr to
the ل, meaning مِنْ عَالِ [or rather مِنْ عَالِ الدَّارِ
i. e. I came to him, or it, from the high, or
elevated, part of the house or abode]: (S:) or the
using عَل [thus] as a prefixed noun is a mistake.
(Mughnee.) ―
-b2-  And one says, اُزْجُرِ الفَزَّ عَلِ عَلِ
and ↓ عَلَا عَلَا [Chide thou the young one of the
wild cow, saying عَلِ عَلِ and عَلَا عَلَا]. (TA.)
عَلَا [as a subst.]: see the next preceding paragraph, in two places.
-A2-  See also عَلَاةٌ.
عَلْوٌ: see عُلْوٌ in five places. ―
-b2-  Also A high, or
an elevated, state of the base, or foundation, of a
building. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And you say, أَخَذَهُ عَلْوًا,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  He took him, or it, by force. (K,
TA.) See also the next but one of the preceding
paragraphs.
عُلْوٌ and ↓ عِلْوٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ عَلْوٌ (K) signify The higher, or highest, part (S, Msb, K) of
a house, or an abode, (S, Msb,) or of a thing;
(K;) as also ↓ عِلْوَةٌ (K voce سُفْلٌ) and ↓ عُلَاوَةٌ
and ↓ عَالِيَةٌ. (K in the present art.) You say, قَعَدْتُ
عُلْوَهُ and ↓ عِلْوَهُ and فِى عُلْوِهِ and ↓ فى عِلْوِهِ [i. e.
I sat in the higher, or highest, part of it]. (TA.)
And Aashà-Báhileh says,
إِنِّى أَتَنْنِى لِسَانٌ لَا أُسَرُّ بِهَا
لَا عَجَبٌ مِنْهَا وَلَا سُخُرُ ↓مِنْ عَلْوَ
(S,) or, as in one of my copies of the S, أَسُرُّ and
سَخَرُ,) i. e. Verily information has come to me
[by which I shall not be rejoiced (or by which I
shall not rejoice others, accord. to the latter reading mentioned above,)] from the higher, or highest,
parts of Nejd, (مِنْ أَعْلَى نَجْدٍ, thus in some
copies of the S and in the TA, but in other copies
of the S the word نَجْدٍ is omitted,) [at which
there is no wondering, as at a thing that is improbable, nor any scoffing;] related [thus] with
fet-h to the و and with damm thereto and with
kesr thereto [i. e. عَلْوَ as above and also ↓ عَلْوُ and
↓ عَلْوِ]. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  One says also, هٰذَا شِعْرُ عُلْو
[app. عُلْوٍ], meaning (assumed tropical:)  This is poetry of a high
class: or [the last word may be ↓ عَلْوَ or عَلْوُ or
عَلْوِ, for it may mean], of the higher, or highest,
part of Nejd. (TA.)
عِلْوٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in three
places.
عَلْىٌ: see عَلْيَآءُ.
عِلْىٌ: see عَلِىٌّ.
عَلَى is a particle and a noun (Mbr, S, Mughnee, K) and a verb; (Mbr, S;) though some
assert that it is only a noun, and ascribe this assertion to Sb: (Mughnee:) its alif, (Sb, S, Msb,)
[which, when it has no affix, is written ى, and]
which is originally و, (Sb, S,) [like that of إِلَى,
q. v.,] is changed into [what is properly] ى when
it has a pronominal affix, (Sb, S, Msb,) as in
عَلَيْكَ, (Sb, S,) and عَلَيْهِ; (Msb;) but some of
the Arabs [in this case] leave it unchanged, as in
the saying of a rájiz,
طَارُوا عَلَاهُنَّ فَطِرْ عَلَاهَا
[They fled, or have fled, upon them, (referring to
camels,) and flee thou upon her]; this, it is said,
being of the dial. of Belhárith Ibn-Kaab. (Sb,
S.) ―
-b2-  As a particle, it has nine [or more than
nine] meanings. (Mughnee.) As such, (Mughnee,) or, accord. to Sb, as a noun, (K,) it denotes
الاِسْتِعْلَآء [i. e. superiority] (Msb, Es-Subkee,
Mughnee, K, TA) properly thus termed, (Msb,)
such as is perceptible by sense; (Es-Subkee,
TA;) either with respect to what is signified by
the noun governed by it, and this is generally
the case, (Mughnee,) as in the saying [in the Kur
xxiii. 22 and xl. 80], وَعَلَيْهَا وَعَلَى الْفُلْكِ تُحْمَلُونَ
[And upon them (referring to camels) and upon
the ship, or ships, ye are carried]; (Mughnee,
K;) or with respect to what is near thereto, as
in the saying [in the Kur xx. 10], أَوْ أَجِدُ
عَلَى النَّارِ هُدًى [Or I shall find near upon the
fire, i. e. at the fire, a right direction]: (Mughnee:) and using it to denote الاستعلآء properly
thus termed, you say, كُنْتُ عَلَى السَّطْحِ [I was
upon the flat house-top]: (Msb:) [in like manner
also,] as denoting الاستعلآء that is perceptible by
sense, it occurs in the saying [in the Kur lv. 26],
كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ [Every one that is upon it (referring to the earth) is transitory]: (Es-Subkee,
TA:) and you say, عَلَى زَيْدٍ ثَوْبٌ [Upon Zeyd
is, or was, a garment], عَلَى being here a particle;
and عَلَا زَيْدًا ثَوْبٌ [A garment was upon Zeyd,]
عَلَا being here a verb. (Mbr, S.) And it denotes
الاستعلآء, likewise, tropically thus termed, (Msb,
TA,) such as is ideal, or perceived by the intel-lect; (Msb, Es-Subkee, Mughnee, TA;) as in
the saying زَيْدٌ عَلَيْهِ دَيْنٌ (tropical:)  [Zeyd, a debt is lying
upon him, or incumbent on him, i. e. he owes a
debt, لِفُلَانٍ to such a one], that which is ideal
being thus likened to that which is corporeal;
(Msb;) and in the phrases عَلَيْنَا أَمْرٌ and عَلَيْنَا مَالٌ,
meaning (tropical:)  An affair, or a command, lies, or rests,
upon us, or is incumbent on us, and so property,
[as due from us, i. e.] the former as a duty and
the latter as a debt, i. e. يَثْبُتُ, like as the thing
lies, or rests, (يَثْبُتُ,) upon the place; the latter
phrase importing responsibility: and ثَبَتَ عَلَيْهِ
مَالٌ is also said to mean كَثُرَ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  property was,
or became, much in quantity, or amount, upon
him, app. as a burden imposing upon him responsibility]. (TA.) And it [likewise] denotes ideal
استعلآء in the phrase لَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنْبٌ (tropical:)  [A crime,
or an offence, committed upon (or here, as in
many other instances, it may be rendered against)
me is imputable to them]: (Mughnee:) and so in
the saying [in the Kur ii. 254 and xvii. 22],
فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ (tropical:)  [We have made some of
them to have superiority over some]. (Es-Subkee,
Mughnee, TA.) [See also أَنْتَ عَلَى عَيْنِى, and
and أَنْتَ عَلَى رَأْسِى, voce عَيْنٌ, first quarter.] ―
-b3-
It also denotes concomitance, like مَعَ; as in the
saying [in the Kur ii. 172], وَآتَى المَالَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ
[And giveth property with (or notwithstanding)
the love of it]; (Mughnee, K;) and so it is said
to be used in the phrase, in a trad. respecting
the alms of the breaking of the fast [of Ramadán],
عَلَى كُلِّ حُرٍّ وَعَبْدٍ صَاعٌ [With every free man and
slave, a sáa], because the alms-gift of the breaking of the fast is not incumbent on the slave, but
only on his master; (IAth, TA;) and so it is
used in the [common] phrase, عَلَى أَنَّنِى رَاضٍ
[With (or notwithstanding) my being pleased, or
well pleased, or content]. (Har p. 13.) ―
-b4-  It also
denotes transition, (Mughnee, K,) like عَنْ;
(Mughnee;) as in the saying (of El-Koheyf El-
'Okeylee, TA),
إِذَا رَضِيَتْ عَلَىَّ بَنُو قُشَيْرٍ
لَعَمْرُ اللّٰهِ أَعْجَبَنِى رِضَاهَا
[When the sons of Kusheyr shall be pleased, or
well pleased, or content, with me, (or rather, if عَلَىَّ
here denote transition, with what will proceed
from me,) by the everlasting existence of God,
their being pleased, &c., will induce in me admiration, or pleasure], (Mughnee, K, * TA,) i. e. عَنِّى;
(Mughnee, TA;) or it may be that رَضِىَ is made
to imply the meaning of عَطَفَ [which is trans.
by means of عَلَى]; (Mughnee;) or, as Ks says,
it is made to accord with its contr. سَخِطَ, (Mughnee, TA,) by its being made trans. by means of
عَلَى: (TA:) and so in the saying,
فِى لَيْلَةٍ لَا نَرَى بِهَا أَحَدًا
يَحْكِى عَلَيْنَا إِلَّا كَوَاكِبَهَا
[In a nigh in which we shall not see any one that
shall report what will proceed from us, except its
stars], i. e., عَنَّا; or it may be said that يَحْكِى is
[here] made to imply the meaning of يَنُِمُّ. (Mughnee.) ―
-b5-  It is also used to assign a cause, like ل;
as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 181], وَلِتُكَبِّرُوا اللّٰهَ
عَلَى مَا هَدَاكُمْ, (Mughnee, K,) meaning لِهِدَايَتِهِ
إِيَّاكُمْ [i. e. And that ye should magnify God
for, or on account of, his rightly directing you];
(Mughnee;) [and in the same, vi. 90, &c., لَا
أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا i. e. I will not ask of you for it,
or on account of it, a recompense;] and as in the
saying of Rabee'ah Ibn Makroom Ed-Dabbee,
فَدَعَوْا نَزَالِ فَكُنْتُ أَوَّلَ نَازِلٍ
وَعَلَامَ أَرْكَبُهُ إِذَا لَمْ أَنْزِلِ
i. e. [And they called out, “Alight; ” and I was
the first of any alighting:] and for what [or
wherefore] do I ride him if I do not alight when
called upon to do so? (Ham p. 29. [عَلَامَ is
here, as usually, for عَلَى مَ.]) ―
-b6-  It is also used
in the sense of فِى [generally followed by a noun
significant of time]; (S, Mughnee, K; *) as in the
saying [in the Kur xxviii. 14], وَدَخَلَ الْمَدِينَةَ
عَلَى حِينِ غَفْلَةٍ [And he entered the city in, or
during, a time of inadvertence]; (Mughnee, K;)
and in the saying [in the same ii. 96], وَاتَّبَعُوا مَا
تَتْلُو الشَّيَاطِينُ عَلَى مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَانَ, meaning, فِى
زَمَنِ مُلكِ سليمان [i. e. And they followed what
the devils related, or recited, in the time of, or
during, the reign of Suleymán (or Solomon)];
(Mughnee;) and in the phrase, كَانَ كَذَا عَلَى
عَهْدِ فُلَانٍ, meaning, فِى عَهْدِهِ [i. e. It was thus,
or such a thing was, in the time of such a one]:
(S:) [and in like manner it is used in the saying
in the Kur iii. 173, مَا كَانَ اللّٰهُ لِيَذَرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ
عَلَى مَا أَنْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ God is not purposing to leave,
or certainly will not leave, the believers in that
state wherein ye are: and in the phrase عَلَى سَفَرٍ,
in ii. 180 &c. of the same, i. e. In (or, as we also
say, on) a journey: in like manner also] لَقَدْ
سَرَيْتُ عَلَى الظَّلَامِ, in a verse of Aboo-Kebeer
El-Hudhalee, means, فِى الظَّلَامِ [i. e. I have
journeyed by night in the darkness], فى الظلام
holding the place of a noun in the accus. case as
a ظَرْف [i. e. an adverbial noun of time or place];
or it may be in the place of a denotative of state,
meaning وَأَنَا عَلَى الظَّلَامِ i. e. رَاكِبٌ لَهُ [riding
upon the darkness]: (Ham p. 37:) and you say
of one who was desiring to rise and hasten, رَأَيْتُهُ
عَلَى أَوْفَاضٍ [i. e. I found him in a state of haste:
see وَفْضٌ]. (TA.) ―
-b7-  [It also denotes conformity,
accordance, adaptation, or agreement; as in the
phrase, اِضْرِبْهُ عَلَى طَبْعِ هٰذَا i. e. Make thou it,
fashion it, or mould it, conformably, or according, to the model, make, fashion, or mould, of this;
(see طَبْعٌ;) and in طُبِعَ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ and جُبِلَ and
فُطِرَ &c. i. e. He (a man) was created conformably, or with an adaptation or a disposition, to
the thing: (see 1 in art. طبع:) so too in the
phrase in the Kur xxiv. last verse, قَدْ يَعْلَمُ مَا أَنْتُمْ
عَلَيْهِ Certainly He knoweth that state of conduct
and mind to which ye are conforming yourselves;
and in many other passages therein: thus also in
the saying of Mohammad, كُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلَى
الفِطْرةِ Every infant is born in a state of conformity to the natural constitution with which he
is created in his mother's womb in relation to the
soul; (see art. فطر;) and in the prov., mentioned
by Meyd, النَّاسُ عَلَى دِينِ المُلُوكِ The people are
in conformity to, i. e. are followers of, or follow,
the religion of the kings; and in the phrase, relating to a saying or an opinion, عَلَيْهِ أَكْثَرُ العُلَمَآءِ
Upon it most of the learned are in agreement; in
which, as in other exs. of the same kind, a verb
or a part. n., (in the last, for instance, مُجْمِعُونَ
or the like,) is understood. ―
-b8-  It also denotes a
condition; as in the phrases, صَالَحَهُ عَلَى كَذَا
He made peace, or reconciliation, or a compromise, with him on the condition of such a thing,
and عَلَى أَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا on the condition of his doing
such a thing. ―
-b9-  And there are various other usages
of this prep. depending upon verbs or part. ns.
expressed or obviously understood in connection
with them, too numerous to be here collected.
Many of these will be found among the explanations of words with which they occur.] ―
-b10-  It is
also used in the sense of مِنْ; as in the saying,
إِذَا اكْتَالُوا عَلَى النَّاسِ يَسْتَوْفُونَ, (S, Mughnee, K,)
in the Kur [lxxxiii. 2], meaning, مِنَ النَّاسِ [i. e.
Who, when they take by measure from men, take
fully], (S,) or, as in the T, عَنِ النَّاسِ [which signifies the same]. (TA.) ―
-b11-  It is also used in the
sense of بِ; (S, Mughnee, K;) as in the saying
in the Kur [vii. 103], عَلَى أنْ لَا أَقُولَ عَلَى اللّٰهِ إِلَّا
الْحَقَّ, (Mughnee, K, *) meaning بِأَنْ, (TA,) [i. e.
That I should not say of God aught save the
truth,] and Ubeí read with ب [i. e. بِأَنْ]; (Bd,
Mughnee;) like as they say, رَمَيْتُ عَلَى القَوْسِ
[meaning بِالقَوْسِ, i. e. I shot with the bow], and
جِئْتُ عَلَى حَالٍ حَسَنَةٍ [meaning بِحَالٍ حَسَنَةٍ, i. e.
I came in a good condition]; (Bd; [in which,
and also voce حَقِيقٌ, last sentence, see more;])
and they said also, اِرْكَبْ عَلَى اسْمِ اللّٰهِ [meaning,
بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ, i. e. Mount thou in the name of God]:
(Mughnee:) thus [too] it is used in the saying of
Aboo-Dhu-eyb,
يَسَرٌ يُفِيضُ عَلَى القِدَاحِ وَيَصْدَعُ
[expl. in art. فيض, conj. 4,] meaning بِالقِدَاحِ:
(S:) [and in the phrase عَلَى يَدِهِ i. e. By his
hand, or (assumed tropical:)  by his means.] ―
-b12-  It is also used to
denote an emendation, (Mughnee, K,) and a
digression, or transition, (Mughnee,) like لٰكِنَّ;
(TA;) as in the saying, فُلَانٌ لَا يَدْخُلُ الجَنَّةَ لِسُوءِ
صَنِيعِهِ, (Mughnee,) or فُلَانٌ جَهَنَّمِىٌّ, (K,) عَلَى أَنَّهُ
لَا يّيْأَسُ مِنْ رَحْمةِ اللّٰهِ, (Mughnee, K,) meaning
لٰكِنَّهُ [i. e. Such a one will not enter Paradise,
because of the evilness of his deed, or conduct, or
such a one is hell-doomed; but, or yet, he will not
despair of the mercy of God]: (TA:) and thus
it is used in the saying,
بِكُلٍّ تَدَاوَيْنَا فَلَمْ يُشْفَ مَا بِنَا
عَلَى أَنَّ قُرْبَ الدَّارِ خَيْرٌ مِنَ البُعْدِ
عَلَى أَنَّ قُرْبَ الدَّارِ لَيْسَ بِنَافِعٍ
إِذَا كَانَ مَنْ تَهْوَاهُ لِيْسَ بِذِى وَدِّ
[With everything we treated, or have treated, ourselves curatively, and what was in us was not, or
has not been, healed; but the nearness of the abode
is better than the remoteness; but the nearness of
the abode is not profitable when the person whom
thou lovest is not endued with affection]: the poet
invalidates by the first عَلَى his saying فَلَمْ يُشْفَ
مَا بِنَا; and then, by the second عَلَى, the clause
immediately preceding it. (Mughnee.) ―
-b13-  It is
also redundant, for the purpose of compensation;
as in the saying,
إِنَّ الكَرِيمَ وَأَبِيكَ يَعْتَمِلْ
إِنْ لَمْ يَجِدْ يَوْمًا عَلَى مَنْ يَتَّكِلْ
meaning مَنْ يَتَّكِلُ عَلَيْهِ [i. e. Verily the generous,
by thy father, will work for himself when he finds
not, some day, him upon whom he may rely];
عَلَى being added before مَنْ for the purpose of
compensation [for its omission in its proper place]:
(Mughnee, K:) Es-Subkee says, it may be redundant, as in the saying, لَا أَحْلِفُ عَلَى يَمِينٍ, meaning لا احلف يَمِينًا [i. e. I will not swear an oath].
(TA.)
-A2-  It is also a noun, having the meaning
of فَوْق [i. e. The location that is above, or over],
this being the case when it is immediately followed
by مِنْ; (S, Msb, Mughnee, K; *) as in the saying (of Muzáhim-El-'Okeylee, describing a قَطَاة
[or sand-grouse, and, afterwards, its making a
rumbling sound in its inside, from thirst], TA),
غَدَتْ مِنْ عَلَيْهِ بِعْدَ مَا تَمَّ ظِمْؤُهَا
[It went away in the early morning from the
location above it, (or, as we say, from above it,)
after that her interval between two comings to
water was complete]: (Msb, Mughnee, K: [and
a similar ex. is cited in the S:]) or, accord. to
As, meaning مِنْ عِنْدِهِ [from its vicinage]: and,
used in this sense, as a noun, it admits before it
no other prep. than مِنْ. (Msb.)
-A3-  عَلَيْكَ is also
a verbal noun, used as an incentive: (TA:) you
say, عَلَيْكَ زَيْدًا, (S, K, TA,) and بِزَيْدٍ, (TA,)
meaning Take thou Zeyd; or take thou hold of
Zeyd: (S, TA:) or keep thou, or cleave thou, to
Zeyd: (K, TA:) and عَلَيْكَ بِكَذَا keep thou to
such a thing: (El-Munáwee, TA in art. ب:)
[thus] it is said in a trad., عَلَيْكَ باِلرِّفْقِ [Keep
thou to gentleness]. (El-Jámi' es-Sagheer.) ―
-b2-
And [in like manner] you say, عَلَىَّ زَيْدًا, and
بِزَيْدٍ, meaning Give thou me, or present thou to
me, Zeyd: (S, TA:) [or, more commonly, bring
thou to me Zeyd:] you say, عَلَىَّ بِكَذَا, meaning
bring thou to me such a thing. (MA.)
عُلًى: see عَلَآءٌ. ―
-b2-  [It is also pl. of عُلْيَا, fem.
of أَعْلَى, q. v.]
عَلَاةٌ The سِنْدَان [or anvil], (S, Mgh, K, TA,)
whether of شجر [app. meaning of such as are
made from trees, or perhaps this is a mistranscription for صَخْر, i. e. rock], or of iron; or the
زُبْرَة [i. e. iron anvil] upon which the blacksmith
beats iron: (TA:) pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]
↓ عَلًا. (S.) ―
-b2-  Hence it is applied to a she-camel,
as being likened thereto in respect of her hardness:
you say نَاقَةٌ عَلَاةُ الخَلْقِ (assumed tropical:)  [A she-camel hard, or
firm, in respect of make]: (S:) or عَلَاةٌ thus
applied signifies tall, or overtopping; as also
↓ عِلْيَانٌ, and ↓ عِلِّيَانٌ: (K, TA:) or ↓ عِلْيَانٌ,
(TA,) or ↓ عَلْيَانٌ, (S,) and ↓ عِلِّيَانٌ, (TA,) signify, thus applied, tall and bulky; (S, TA;) or,
as some say, outstripping in pace or journeying;
never seen otherwise than before the other camels.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  Also A stone [placed upon two other
stones called حِمَارَانِ (q. v.)] upon which is put [to
dry the preparation of curd called] أَقِط: (S, K,
TA:) or, as some say, a piece of rock upon
which is made a circle of أَخْثَآء [or lumps of dung
such as is called خِثْى (q. v.)] and bricks, or crude
bricks, (لَبِن,) and ashes, and in, or upon, which
أَقَط is then cooked: pl. [or coll. gen. n.] as above.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  And A thing like the [milking-vessel
called] عُلْبَة, around which [dung such as is called]
خِثْى is put, and which is used for milking
therein. (K.)

عَلْيَآءُ A high place; (IAth, K, TA;) a subst.

of أَعْلَى; for if it were this, it would [by rule] be
necessarily determinate; (IAth, TA;) [though]
it is sometimes used as syn. with عُلْيَا, see أَعْلَى:

thing. (K.) The head of a mountain: (K, TA:)

nobility; (K;) as also ↓ عُلًى, and ↓ مَعْلَاةٌ; (S;)
or this last signifies the acquisition of high, or

or means, of acquiring high, or elevated, rank &c.;
being originally مَعْلَوَةٌ, of the measure مَفْعَلَةٌ, like
مَبْخَلَةٌ and مَجْبَنَةٌ &c.;] and its pl. is مَعَالٍ, (S,
Msb,) whence مَعَالِى الأُمُورِ i. e. مكتسب الشرف [a
strange explanation of a pl. by a sing., app. meaning (the affairs, or actions, that are) the cause, or
means, of acquiring high, or elevated, rank &c.].

عِلِىٌّ.
عَلِىٌّ High, elevated, or lofty; (S, K;) applied
to a thing; (K;) [and] so ↓ عَالٍ: (Msb:) so, too,
the former, [and more commonly so,] in respect
of rank, condition, or state; eminent, or noble:
and ↓ عِلْيَةٌ is a pl. thereof in the latter sense;
like as صِبْيَةٌ is of صَبِىٌّ; [or, as some hold a word
of this form and class to be, a quasi-pl. n.;] as in
the saying, فُلَانٌ مِنْ عِلْيَةِ النَّاسِ [Such a one is of
the high in rank, &c., of men]; (S;) or عِلْيَةٌ, as
also ↓ عِلْىٌ, [which latter is of a form proper to
quasi-pl. ns. by common consent,] signifies the
great in respect of estimation, rank, or dignity, of
men, thus used in a pl. sense. (K.) ―
-b2-  It signifies also Strong, robust, or powerful: (K, TA:)
and hence it is used as a proper name of a man;
(K, * TA;) and it may be also from the meaning
of highness of rank &c., eminence, or nobility.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  العَلِىُّ as a name of God signifies [The
