عنف1
عَنُفَ بِهِ (S, MA, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and
عَلَيْهِ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) with damm, (S, O,)
like قَرُبَ, (Mgh, Msb,) or like كَرُمَ, (K,) aor.
عَنُفَ,
(MA, TA,) inf. n. عُنْفٌ (S, * MA, Mgh, O, * Msb,
TA) and عَنَافَةٌ; (MA, Mgh, TA;) and عَنِفَ بِهِ,
aor.
عَنَفَ; (MA;) [and عَنَفَ, inf. n. عَنْفٌ, is mentioned as syn. with عَنُفَ by Golius and Freytag,
by the latter as on the authority of the S and K,
in neither of which do I find it;] He was ungentle, rough, harsh, rigorous, severe, violent, or vehement, with him, or to him: (S, MA, Mgh, O, Msb,
K, TA:) hence the phrase, عَنُفَ عَلَيْهِمْ فِى السَّوْقِ
[He was ungentle, rough, &c., to them in driving]:
(Mgh:) and ↓ عنّفهُ and عنّف عَلَيْهِ signify the
same as عَنُفَ بِهِ: (MA:) you say عَنَّفْتُهُ, inf. n.
تَعْنِيفٌ; and ↓ أَعْنَفْتُهُ; (Lth, O, K;) both meaning عَنُفْتُ عَلَيْهِ; (TK; [and the same is implied
in the K;]) both from العُنْفُ: (Lth, O:) or
↓ التَّعْنِيفُ signifies the upbraiding, or reproaching;
and blaming, reproving, or censuring: (S, O:)
you say عنّفهُ, inf. n. تَعْنِيفٌ, (Msb, K, TA,)
meaning he blamed, reproved, or censured, him;
(Msb;) or did so with roughness or harshness, and
vehemence; (K, TA;) omitted in some of the
copies of the K; (TA;) or did so in anger or
displeasure; (Msb;) upbraided, or reproached,
him; blamed, reproved, or censured, him with
reproach. (TA.)

K, TA:) or (K) I was ignorant of the affair;
(O, K, TA;) and found it troublesome, or difficult, and hard, to do; (TA;) whence the saying

[With four legs not ignorant of the pace termed
عَنَق]: (O, TA:) and [simply] I had no knowledge in the affair: (O:) and اعتنفت الشَّىْءَ I
took to, or set about, the thing, (أَخَذْتُهُ [as above],)
or I entered into, engaged in, did, or performed,
the thing, (أَتَيْتُهُ,) not being skilled, nor having
knowledge, in it. (TA. (See, again, 4.]) ―

therein upon any one, should remove from it,
says, وَاعْتِنَافُ المَجْلِسِ مَا يَذْعَرُ عَنْهُ النَّوْمَ [i. e. And
the removing from the sitting-place is a cause of
scaring from him sleep]: making الاِعْتِنَافُ to be
the putting himself in motion, and removing from
place to place; which is like الاِئْتِنَاف [or the beginning, or commencing, anew]. (Az, O.) ―
