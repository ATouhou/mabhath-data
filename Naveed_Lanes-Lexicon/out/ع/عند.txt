عَنْدٌ: and عَنْدَ: see the next paragraph.
عُنْدٌ: and عُنْدَ: see the next paragraph.
عِنْدٌ and ↓ عَنْدٌ and ↓ عُنْدٌ, (O, K,) accord. to
Ibn-'Abbád, (O,) i. q. نَاحِيَةٌ [app. as meaning
The vicinage, or the quarter, tract, region, or
place, of a person or thing]: (O, K:) whence
the saying, هُوَ عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ الآنَ [He is in the
vicinage, or the quarter, &c., of such a one, now].
(O.) [See also عَنَدٌ, which has a similar meaning.]
-A2-  عِنْدَ and ↓ عَنْدَ and ↓ عُنْدَ signify the
same, (S, O, Msb, Mughnee, K,) being dial. vars.,
(S, O, Msb,) the first of which is the most common, (Mughnee,) and the most chaste: (Msb:)
each is an adv. n. of place, and also of time; (S,
O, Msb, Mughnee, K;) [used in the manner of
a prep., though properly a prefixed noun;] of
place when prefixed to a noun signifying a place
[or anything local]; (TA;) of time when prefixed
to a noun signifying a time: (Msb, TA:) denoting
presence, (S, O,) i. e. perceptible presence, and
also ideal presence, or rather the place of presence; (Mughnee;) and nearness, (S, O, Mughnee,) or the place of nearness; (Mughnee;) or
the utmost nearness, and therefore it has no dim.;
(T, TA;) [i. e.] it is primarily used in relation
to that which is present with a person [or thing],
in any adjacent part or quarter with respect to
that person [or thing]; or in relation to that
which is near to a person [or thing]: (Msb:)
[thus it signifies At, near, nigh, by, near by, or
close by, a place, or thing; with, present with, or
in the presence of, a person or persons, or a thing
or things; at the abode of a person; at the place
of, or in the region of, a thing; or among, or
amongst, persons or things: and at, near, nigh,
or about, a time; and at, or on, or upon, denoting
the occasion of an event or an action:] ―
-b2-  using
it as an adv. n. of place, you say عِنْدَ البَيْتِ [At,
near, nigh, by, near by, or close by, the house or
tent]; (TA;) and عِنْدَ الحَائِطِ [At, near, nigh,
&c., the wall]; (S, O;) [and عِنْدِى زَيْدٌ With
me, present with me, in my presence, or at my
abode, is Zeyd; and كُنْتُ عِنْدَ القَوْمِ I was with,
or among, the people, or party; and] فَلَمَّا رَآهُ
مُسْتَقِرًّا عِنْدَهُ [And when he saw it standing in his
presence (in the Kur xxvii. 40)] is an ex. of its
use as denoting presence perceptible by sense:
and it is used as denoting nearness in the phrase
عِنْدَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى [Nigh to the lote-tree of the
ultimate point of access (in the Kur liii. 14)]:
(Mughnee:) you say also, عِنْدِى مَالٌ, meaning
With me, or by me, i. e. present with me, is property; and meaning also in my possession, and in
my power and at my disposal, is property, though
absent from me; I have, or possess, property;
(Msb, Mughnee; *) and لِى عِنْدَهُ مَالٌ [I have
property in his hands, or possession; or there is
property due to me in his hands, or possession;
meaning, owed to me by him]; as also قِبَلَهُ: (TA
in art. قبل:) hence it is used in relation to attributes; so that one says, عِنْدَهُ خَيْرٌ وَفَضْلٌ [He has,
or possesses, goodness and excellence]; and مَا عنِدَهُ
شَرٌّ [He has not evil]: and hence the saying in
the Kur [xxviii. 27], فَإِنْ أَتْمَمْتَ عَشْرًا فَمِنْ عِنْدِكَ
i. e. [And if thou complete ten years, it will be] of
thy redundant bounty; (Msb;) [or of thine own
freewill; as is implied in the explanation by Bd,
and agreeably with common usage:] and it is
used as denoting ideal presence in the phrase
قَالَ الَّذِى عِنْدَهُ عِلْمٌ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ [He with whom was,
i. e. who possessed, knowledge the of Scripture said
(in the Kur xxvii. 40)]: (Mughnee:) [hence also]
one says, لِى عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ حَاجَةٌ [I have an object of
want to be sought, or required, at the hand of such
a one, or a want to be supplied on the part of such
a one; meaning I want a thing of such a one; as
also قِبَلَ فُلَانٍ]: (TA in art. حوج:) [and in like
manner one says of a right or due (حَقٌّ): and
طَلَبَ حَاجَةً عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ He sought an object of
want at the hand of such a one: (see an ex. in
art. علو, conj. 3:)] ―
-b3-  using it as an adv. n. of
time, you say عِنْدَ الصُّبْحِ [At, near, nigh, or
about, daybreak]; (Msb, TA;) and عِنْدَ اللَّيْلِ
[At, near, nigh, or about, night]; (S, O;) and
جِئْتُكَ عِنْدَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ [I came to thee at, near,
&c., the rising of the sun]; (Mughnee;) [and عِنْدَ
ذٰلِكَ At, on, upon, or on the occasion of, that
event; thereupon; and عِنْدَمَا فَعَلَ كَذَا At, on,
upon, or on the occasion of, his doing such a
thing.] ―
-b4-  It admits before it the prep. مِنْ, (S,
O, Msb, Mughnee, K,) but no other prep.; (S,
O, Msb;) like as does لَدُنْ: (S, O:) as in the
saying, جِئْتُ مِنْ عِنْدِهِ [I came from his presence,
or his vicinage: or I came from him; for in this
case it may be considered as redundant]: (Msb:)
and in the saying آتَيْنَاهُ رَحْمَةً مِنْ عِنْدِنَا وَعَلَّمْنَاهُ
مِنْ لَدُنَّا عِلْمًا [Upon whom we had bestowed mercy
from us, and whom we had taught, from us,
knowledge (in the Kur xviii. 64)]: (Mughnee:)
[and in an ex. above, from the Kur xxviii. 27:
and one says of a gift, هٰذَا مِنْ عِنْدِى, meaning
This is from, or of, my property; or from me;
or, by way of emphasis, from myself:] one should
not say [as the vulgar do], مَضَيْتُ إِلَى عِنْدِكَ;
nor إِلَى لَدُنْكَ. (S, O, K. *) ―
-b5-  Being a vague
adv. n., (T, TA,) it may not be used otherwise
than as an adv. n., (T, S, O, K, TA,) except in
the following case: (T, O, TA:) one says of a
thing without knowing it, هٰذَا عِنْدِى كَذَا [This is
in my judgment, or opinion, thus]; and thereupon
another says, أَوَلَكَ عِنْدٌ [And hast thou a judgment, or an opinion?]: (T, A, * O, * K, * TA:)
and in like manner one says,
وَمَنْ أَنْتُمُ حَتَّى يَكُونَ لَكُمْ عِنْدٌ
[And who are ye, that ye should have a judgment,
or an opinion?]: (TA:) and thus in the saying, (Mughnee, TA,) of one of the Muwelleds,
(Mughnee,)
لَا يُسَاوِى نِصْفَ عِنْدِ  كُلَّ عِنْدٍ لَكَ عِنْدِى
[Every judgment, or opinion, of thine, in my
judgment, or opinion, will not equal the half of a
judgment, or an opinion]: (Mughnee, TA:) they
assert that عِنْد in this case means the mind, (T,
O, * K, * TA,) i. e. القَلْب, and المَعْقُول, (O, K,)
or القَلْب and مَا فِيهِ مَعْقُولُ اللُّبِّ; (T, TA;) [as
in the phrase بُرْ لِى مَا عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ, expl. in the S,
in art. بور, as meaning Try thou, or examine, and
learn, for me, what is in the mind (نَفْس) of such
a one; and in many other instances:] but this
assertion is not valid: (T, TA:) [in a case of
this kind] it means judgment [or opinion]: thus
one says, هٰذَا عِنْدِى أَفْضَلُ مِنْ هٰذَا i. e. [This is]
in my judgment [more excellent than this]: (Msb:)
and أَنْتَ عِنْدِى ذَاهِبٌ i. e. [Thou art] in my
opinion [going away]: (Fr, Th, TA:) and هٰذَا
القَوْلُ عِنْدِى صَوَابٌ [This saying is in my judgment, or opinion, right, or correct]: (Mughnee:)
[and in like manner, عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ is generally best
rendered In the estimation, or sight, of God.] ―
-b6-
[Sometimes it denotes comparison: see an ex.
voce تَعَاظَمَ.] ―
-b7-  It is also sometimes used to denote incitement, (S, O, K,) being in this case prefixed [to كَ or the like]; not alone: (MF:) yon
say, عِنْدَكَ زَيْدًا, meaning Take thou Zeyd. (S,
O, K.) ―
-b8-  And in cautioning a person respecting
a thing before him, one says, عِنْدَكَ, [meaning
Keep thou where thou art; and it is still used in
this sense;] in which case it is an intrans. verbal
noun. (Sb, L, TA.)
عَنَدٌ The side [of a thing]; syn. جَانِبٌ. (S, A,
O, L, K. [See also عِنْدٌ, first sentence.]) One
says, يَمْشِى وَسَطًا لَا عَنَدًا [He walks in the middle,
not on, or at, one side]. (S, O.) And عَنَدَهْ, [for
عَنَدَهُ,] occurring at the end of a verse [of which
I find several different readings, and which I
have cited accord. to one of those readings voce
حُبَارَى], means by its side: (O, L:) but Th says,
in explaining that verse, as describing the حُبَارَى
teaching its young one to fly, that العَنَدُ signifies
الاِعْتِرَاضُ: [so that عَنَدَهْ there, accord. to him,
app. means اِعْتِرَاضًا لَهُ, which may be rendered
presenting itself before it:] or, accord. to As,
[عَنَدَهْ there means imitating its actions in flying;
for he says that] عَنَدٌ is a subst. from عَانَدَ الحُبَارَى
فَرْخَهُ [expl. above: see 3]. (L.)
طَعْنٌ عَنِدٌ A thrusting [with a spear or the like]
to the right and left. (S, O.) [See also عَانِدٌ.]
عُنْدَدٌ or عُنْدُدٌ, (accord. to different copies of
the S,) or both, (O, L, K,) in which the radical
letters are said to be عند because of the duplication of the د, and because ن when it occupies the
second place in a word is not considered augmentative unless proved to be so, (L,) An avoiding, or escaping: (S, O, L, K:) and the former,
artifice. (AZ, O, K.) One says, مَا لِى عَنْهُ عُنْدَدٌ
and عُنْدُدٌ (Lh, L, K, and written, as on the
authority of AZ, in both these ways in the O and
in different copies of the S, but with مِنْهُ in the
place of عَنْهُ,) and ↓ مُعْلَنْدَدٌ (S, O, L, K) and
↓ مُعْلَنْدِدٌ, (K,) meaning I have no way of avoiding it, or escaping it. (AZ, Lh, S, O, L, K.) And
مَا وَجَدْتُ إِلَى ذٰلِكَ عُنْدَدًا and عُنْدُدًا (Lh, L) and
↓ مُعْلَنْدَدًا (Lh, S, O) and ↓ مُعْلَنْدِدًا (Lh, O) I
found no way of attaining to that: (Lh, S, O,
L:) and ↓ مَا لِى إِلَيْهِ مُعْلَنْدِدٌ (Lh, L in art. علد,
and K) and ↓ مُعْلَنْدَدٌ (Lh, L) I have no way of
attaining to it. (Lh, L, K.) [See also art. علد.]
-A2-  عُنْدَدٌ also signifies Old, or ancient. (AA,
O, K.)
[
عِنْدِيَّةٌ A saying عِنْدِى, meaning In my opinion;
an assertion of mere opinion of one's own. Hence
the phrase, هٰذَا مِنْ عِنْدِيَّاتِهِ (occurring in the TA
in art. جرب) This is one of his assertions of
mere opinion.]

right way, or course; (S, O, L;) as also ↓ عَنِيدٌ.

-b2-  A
she-camel that deviates from the road by reason
of her sprightliness and strength: pl. عُنُدٌ and

one side of the other camels: (IAar and Aboo-Nasr:) pl. of the first عُنُدٌ; (S, O, L;) and of
the second and third, عُنَّدٌ and عَوَانِدُ. (L.) ―
-b4-  A
she-camel that continues to be opposite to the other
camels, [or by their side;] keeping pace with
them: one that precedes them, or leads them, is

to ISd, عَنُودٌ is applied to a beast (دَابَّة), and to a
wild ass, that precedes others in her pace. (L.)
