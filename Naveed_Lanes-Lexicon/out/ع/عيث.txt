عيث1
عَاثَ, aor. يَعِيثُ, inf. n. عَيْثٌ (S, O, K) and
عُيُوثٌ and عَيَثَانٌ, (TA,) He acted corruptly; or
made, or did, mischief; syn. أَفْسَدَ: (S, O, K:)
or, accord. to Az, he hastened, or was hasty or
quick, in so acting: (TA:) accord. to Er-Rághib,
عَيْثٌ and عُثِىٌّ, or عِثِىٌّ, and عُثُوٌّ are nearly alike;
but عَيْثٌ is mostly used in relation to that which
is perceived by sense; and عثىّ and عثوّ, in relation to that which is perceived by the [mind or]
judgment: some say that عثوّ is the “ acting corruptly in the utmost degree: ” and some, that it
is the “ acting wrongfully, injuriously, or unjustly; ” and sometimes does not involve the acting corruptly: (MF, TA:) Lh says that عَثِىَ is
of the dial. of El-Hijáz, and is the [more] approved
form; and عاث is of the dial. of the BenooTemeem, who say, لَا تَعِيثُوا فِى الأَرْضِ [Act not
ye corruptly, or do not ye mischief, in the earth].
(TA.) Hence one says, عاث الذِّئْبُ فِى الغَنَمِ
The wolf made, or did, mischief among the sheep
or goats; syn. أَفْسَدَ. (S, A, O.) And عِيثِى جَعَارِ
[Do mischief, O she-hyena]: a prov. used in
declaring a thing to be vain, or false. (K in art.
جعر.) And عاث فِى مَالِهِ He dissipated his property; or squandered, and wasted, or ruined, it:
and he expended it quickly. (TA.) ―

عيّث, (S, O, K,) inf. n. تَعْيِيثٌ, (S, O,) He
searched [or groped] for a thing with the hand,
without his seeing it: (S, O, K:) or, said of a
blind man, he searched [or groped] for a thing:
and, said of a man possessing sight, he searched
[or groped] for a thing in the dark: written by
Kr with غ. (L.) [It is said in the TA, in
art. غيث, that ISd thought عيّث, with the unpointed ع, to be a mistranscription; but that it is
correct.] ―

his hand into the quiver to search for an arrow:
(TA:) or he turned about his hand in the quiver

عَجَبَى:]) a word expressive of wonder: one says
عَيْثَى لَهُ, meaning عَجَبًا لَهُ, for أَعْجَبُ عَجَبًا لَهُ [I
wonder greatly, lit. with wondering, at him, or it]:
(TK: [but a verse cited in the O indicates that
one says عَيْثَى بِهِ:]) in one copy of the K, عَيْثًا.
