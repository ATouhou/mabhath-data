fabulous bird:] AHát says, in the Book of Birds,
العَنْقَآءُ المُغْرِبَةُ means calamity; and not any of
the birds that we know: IDrd says, عَنْقَآءُ مُغْرِبٌ
is a phrase for which there is no foundation: it is
said to mean a great bird that is not seen save
[once] in ages; and by frequency of usage it became a name for calamity: (O:) it is also said
to be called عنقآء because it has in its neck a
whiteness like the neck-ring: Kr says that they
assert it to be a bird that is found at the place of
the setting of the sun: Zj, that it is a bird that
no one has seen: some say that it is meant in the
Kur cv. 3: and some, that it is the eagle: (TA:)
it is called in Pers. سِيمُرْغ: (MA:) and it is
mentioned also in art. غرب [q. v.]. (K.) [See
