عرقبQ. 1
عَرْقَبَ الدَّابَّةَ He hocked, houghed, hamstrung, or cut the hock-tendon of, the beast. (S,
A, O, K, *) ―
-b2-  And عَرْقَبَهُ He raised his hocks,
(namely, a camel's, O,) in order that he might
stand up: (O, K:) he assisted him (i. e. a camel)
to stand up, by raising [his hocks]. (TA.) Thus
the verb has two contr. meanings. (K.) ―
-b3-  And
عَرْقَبَ (assumed tropical:)  He practised artifice, craft, or cunning.
(O, K.) One says, إِذَا أَعْيَاكَ غَرِيمُكَ فَعَرْقِبْ

&c. (AA, O, TA.)
Q. 2
تَعَرْقَبَ He mounted a beast from behind.
(O, TA.) ―
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  He took his course along the

-b3-  And تعرقب
لِخَصْمِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He pursued a way hidden from his adversary: said when one adopts another and
easier course of speech. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And تعرقب
عَنِ الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  He turned away, or declined, from

-b5-  إِذَا مَطَلَ تَعَقْرَبَ وَإِذَا وَعَدَ
تَعَرْقَبَ (assumed tropical:)  [When he puts off the fulfilment of his
promise, he acts like 'Akrab (a man notorious for
putting off the fulfilment of his promises); and
when he promises, he acts like 'Orkoob] (A, TA)
is a prov. (TA. [See the following paragraph,
last sentence but one.])
عُرْقُوبٌ [The tendo Achillis, or heel-tendon;] a
certain tense, (T, A, Mgh, Msb,) or thick, (K,) or
thick and tense, (S, O,) tendon, (T, S, A, Mgh,
O, Msb, K,) behind the two ankle-bones, (T, A,
Mgh, Msb,) above the heel; (S, O, K;) the thing
that conjoins the shank and the foot; (As, TA;)
in a human being: (S, O, K:) pl. عَرَاقِيبُ. (TA,
&c.) The saying of the Prophet, وَيْلٌ لِلْعَرَاقِيبِ
مِنَ النَّارِ [Woe to the heel-tendons from the fire of
Hell] means, to him who neglects the washing of
them (Mgh, Msb) in the [ablution termed] وُضُوْء.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  [In a beast, it is in some instances applied to The hock, or hough; i. e.] the عُرْقُوب of
a beast is that which, in its hind leg, corresponds
to the رَكْبَة [or knee] in its fore leg: (S, O, K:)
[in other instances, it is applied to the tendon of
the hock, or hough; i. e., to the hamstring; for,
as] As says, in every quadruped, the عُرْقُوبَانِ are
in the hind legs, and the رُكْبَتَانِ in the fore legs;
(S, O, TA;) and the عُرْقُوب of the horse is the
tendon that conjoins the part wherein meet the
وَظِيف [here meaning the metatarsus] and the سَاق
[here meaning the tibia]: (TA: [he says “ of
the horse,” instead of using a more comprehensive
term, app. because he is describing that animal:])
it is, in a quadruped, the tendon that [corresponds
to that which in a human being] is behind the two
ankle-bones, between the joint of the foot and the
shank: in a human being it is a little above the
heel. (TA, from an explanation of a trad. [This
last explanation evidently employs terms according
to their applications in the comparative anatomy
of quadrupeds and human beings, and therefore
requires the words which I have supplied. That
عُرْقُوبٌ, in relation to a beast, signifies the hocktendon is well known: and that it also signifies the
hock itself is shown by a usage of the verb عَرْقَبَ
(for it is by raising the hocks that a man assists
a camel to stand up), and by an explanation voce
رُكْبَةٌ.]) شَرٌّ مَا أَجَآءَكَ إِلَى مُخَّةِ عُرْقُوبٍ [It is an
evil thing that has compelled thee to have recourse
to the marrow of a hock] (K, TA) is a prov.
(TA) applied to him who seeks to obtain a thing
from a mean, or sordid, person; (K, TA;) for
the عرقوب has no marrow. (TA.) And one
says, فُلَانٌ يَضْرِبُ العَرَاقِيبَ ويَقْرَعُ الظَّنَابِيبَ [Such
a one smites the hock-tendons of camels to slaughter
them, and strikes the shins of camels to make them
lie down that he may mount them in haste];
meaning that he entertains guests and gives aid,
or succour. (A.) ―
-b3-  عُرْقُوبُ الأَسَدِ is a name of
The Thirteenth Mansion of the Moon. (Kzw:
see العَوَّآءُ, in art. عو.) ―
-b4-  طَيْرُ عُرْقُوبٍ is an appellation given to Any bird from which one augurs
evil to camels, because it wounds them in the hocks
or hock-tendons (يُعَرْقِبُهَا). (Meyd, TA.) The
Arabs say that when the bird called أَخْيَل [q. v.]
lights upon a camel, its hocks, or hock-tendons,
will assuredly be laid bare: and accord. to the
[O and] K, طَيْرُ العَرَاقِيبِ is an appellation of The
[bird called] شِقِرَّاق [which is said in the S &c. to
be the same as the أَخْيَل]; and [Sgh and SM
add that] they regard it as of evil omen. (TA.)
―
-b5-  عُرْقُوبُ القَطَا means The سَاق [or shank] of the
قطا [or sand-grouse]. (S, O, K.) To this a thing
is hyperbolically likened to denote its shortness:
one says يَوْمٌ أَقْصَرُ مِنْ عُرْقُوبِ القَطَا [A day shorter
than the shank of the katà]: (L, TA:) and a
poet says, (S, &c.,) namely, El-Find Ez-Zimmánee, (O, L, TA,) or, accord. to Seer, Imra-el-
Keys Ibn-'Ábis, (IB, L, TA,)
وَنَبْلِى وَفُقَاهَا كَعَرَاقِيبِ قَطًا طُحْلِ
[And my arrows, with their notches, like the
shanks of ash-coloured sand-grouse]. (S, O, L,
TA.) ―
-b6-  عُرْقُوبٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A turning, or
bending, part of a valley: (K:) or a part of a valley
in which is a great turning or bending. (S, O.)
And A road in a mountain: (K:) or a narrow
road in a mountain: or a road in a deep valley,
in which only one can walk. (TA.) And [the
pl.] عَرَاقِيبُ, (tropical:)  The prominences, or projecting
parts, of mountains: (O, K, TA:) and the most
distant, or far-extending, roads, or ways, thereof:
(Aboo-Kheyreh, O, TA:) for [in travelling mountains,] you follow the most easy way, wherever it
be: (Aboo-Kheyreh, TA:) or the narrow roads
or ways, in the hard and elevated parts, of moun-
tains. (S, O, K.) And [hence, app.,] عَرَاقِيبُ الأُمُورِ
(assumed tropical:)  Great and difficult affairs: (S, O, K:) as also
عَرَاقِيلُهَا. (S, O.) ―
-b7-  And A mountain always
crowned with clouds, not rained upon. (TA.) ―
-b8-
Also (assumed tropical:)  Artifice, craft, or cunning; or a stratagem,
or trick. (O, K. [See Q. 1, last signification.])
―
-b9-  And (assumed tropical:)  Knowledge (عِرْفَان) of an argument, a
plea, an allegation, or a proof. (O, K.)
-A2-  Also
the name of a certain man of the Amalekites,
(S, O, K, TA,) or, (so says Ibn-El-Kelbee, O,) of
the Benoo-Abd-Shems-Ibn-Saad, (Jm, O, TA,)
but this is said to be of no authority, (O,) or of
El-Ows, (Jm, TA,) the greatest liar of his time,
(K,) proverbial for breach of promises: (S, O:)
El-Ashja'ee (whose name was Jubeyhà, O, K)
says,
وَعَدْتَ وَكَانَ الخُلْفُ مِنْكَ سَجِيَّةً
مَوَاعِيدَ عُرْقُوبٍ أَخَاهُ بِيَتْرَبِ
(S, O, K, TA) i. e. (tropical:)  Thou promisedst, but breach
of promise was an inherent quality of thee, like the
promises of 'Orkoob to his brother in Yetreb;
which is in El-Yemámeh; or, as some relate it,
بِيَثْرِب, i. e. El-Medeeneh, or, as some say, the
land of the Benoo-Saad; but the former is the
more correct. (TA. [See also Har p. 160.])
And one says, هُوَ أَكْذَبُ مِنْ عُرْقُوبِ يَتْرَبَ (tropical:)  [He
is more mendacious than 'Orkoob of Yetreb].
(A, TA.)
