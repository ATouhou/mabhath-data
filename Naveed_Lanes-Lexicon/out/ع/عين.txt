[but Mtr says,] the saying تَعَيّنْ عَلَىّٰ حَرِيرًا as

عَيْنٌ is a homonym, applying to various things
(Msb:) in the K. forty-seven (??)
assigned to it; but it is said by MF that its

the Kur-án are seventeen. (TA.,) By that which
is app. its primary application, and which is by
many affirmed to (??) (TA,) العَيْنُ signifies The
eye: the organ of sight: (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA

has been erroneously supposed by Golius and
Freytag to relate to the sing.,]) and [of pause
أَعْيَانٌ and أَعْيُنٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) which last
is asserted by Lh to be sometimes a pl. of mult.,
as it is in the Kur vii. [178 and] 194; (TA.)
and pl. pl. أَعْيُنَاتٌ: (K:) the dim. is ↓ عُيَيْنَةٌ, (S.)
Hence the saying in a trad. of 'Alee, قَاسَ عَيْنًا
بِبَيْضَةٍ جَعَلَ عَلَيْهَا خُطُوطًا [He measured the reach
of an eye by means of an egg upon which he made

thee]: it is said to one whom you send, and require to be quick; and means (assumed tropical:)  pause not for

thee, his doing that which he does not perform:
(TA:) and (K, TA) in this sense, (TA,) one

(tropical:)  Thou art entitled to be honoured and protected
by me above my eye: for the eye is esteemed the
most excellent of the organs, (as is said in this
art. in the TA,) and it is that which most needs
protection:] أَنْتَ عَلَى رَأْسِى is said in relation to
honouring only. (TA.) And the Arabs say, عَلَى
عَيْنِى قَصَدْتُ زَيْدًا, meaning thereby the regarding

mixed with fear above my eye I made Zeyd the
object to which my mind was directed]. (TA.)
[See another ex. of عَلَى عَيْنِى (in which it cannot
be rendered as above) in a later part of this paragraph.] نَعِمَ اللّٰهُ بِكَ عَيْنًا [in the CK نَعَّمَ, which is
wrong,] means the same as أَنْعَمَهَا. (K. [See
both in art. نعم.]) قُرَّةُ العَيْنِ [signifying مَا قَرَّتْ
بِهِ العَيْنُ, as expl. in the M and K in art. قر, i. e.
That by which, or in consequence of which, the eye

ballista]: (K, * TA:) likened to the organ [of
sight] in form. (TA.) ―
-b6-  [In the B, accord. to
the TA, it is also expl. as meaning the سنام: but
this, I think, is most probably a mistranscription
for سَام (q. v.) as signifying (assumed tropical:)  The hollow, or
cavity, in the ground, thus called, in which water
remains, or stagnates, and collects.] And (tropical:)  The
place [or aperture] whence the water of a قَنَاة [i. e.

to ISk, sometimes the Arabs said, as a pl. thereof,

in a trad., cited and expl. voce سَاهِرٌ. (TA.) Also

[lit. (tropical:)  The lands looked with an eye or with two
eyes], meaning, had their herbage come forth:
(K:) or it is said when their herbage comes
forth: or, as in the A, when that which cattle
depasture comes forth without [as yet] becoming
firm [in the ground, or firmly rooted]: taken
from the saying of the Arabs, إِذَا سَقَطَتِ الجَبْهَةُ
نَظَرَتِ الأَرْضُ بِإِحْدَى عَيْنَيْهَا فَإِذَا سَقَطَتِ الصَّرْفَةُ
نَظَرَتْ بِهِمَا جَمِيعًا (assumed tropical:)  [lit. When El-Jebheh (the 10th
Mansion of the Moon) sets aurorally (i. e. about
the 11th of Feb., O. S.), the land looks with one
of its eyes; the, when Es-Sarfeh (the 12th Mansion) sets aurorally (about the 9th of March), it
looks with both of them]. (TA. [See also art.
نظر.])
-A3-  عَيْنٌ also, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) as being
likened to the organ of sight, (TA,) signifies (tropical:)  A
spy; and ↓ ذُو العُيَيْنَتَيْنِ [in the CK ذُو العَيْنَتَيْنِ],

he who looks for a people, or party: (M, TA:)
the watcher, or observer; (S, * K, * TA;) or the
scout: (S, * Msb, K, * TA:) masc. and fem.:

by some to accord with a part [i. e. the eye], and
therefore fem.; and by some, to accord with the
whole [person], and therefore masc.: (TA:) pl.
عُيُونٌ and أَعْيُنٌ, and, accord. to ISk, sometimes
أَعْيَانٌ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  And i. q. مُكَاشِفٌ [app. as
meaning (assumed tropical:)  A discoverer, or revealer, of tidings
&c.]. (Es-Subkee, TA.)
-A4-  [And (assumed tropical:)  An eye as
meaning a look, i. e. an act of looking: and
hence, a stroke of an evil eye: or, simply, an evil
eye: a meaning of frequent occurrence.] أَصَابَتْ
فُلَانًا عَيْنٌ (assumed tropical:)  [An evil eye smote such a one] is said
of a person when an enemy or an envier has
looked at him and produced such an effect upon
him that he has fallen sick in consequence thereof
(TA.) [عَيْنُ الكَمَالِ is applied to an eye believed
to have the power of killing by its glance: see an
ex. voce فَقَأَ.] ―
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  Sight with the eye [or
before the eyes; or ocular view]: thus in the saying,
لَا أَطْلُبُ أَثَرًا بَعْدَ عَيْنٍ (assumed tropical:)  [I will not seek a trace,
or vestige, (or, as we rather say in English, a
shadow,) after an ocular view]: (S, TA:) or the
meaning is, after suffering a reality, or substance,
to escape me: (Har pp. 120 and 174: [this latter
rendering being agreeable with explanations of
عَيْنٌ which will be found in a later part of this
paragraph:]) i. e. I will not leave the thing
when I see it ocularly, and seek the trace or
vestige, thereof, after its [the thing's] disappearing from me: and the origin of it was the fact
that a man saw the slayer of his brother, and
when he desired to slay him, he [the latter] said,
“ I will ransom myself with a hundred she-camels; ” whereupon he [the other] said, لَسْتُ
أَطْلُبُ أَثَرًا بَعْدَ عَيْنٍ; and slew him: (TA:) it is
a prov., thus, or, as some relate it, لَا تَطْلُبْ.
(Har p. 120.) ―
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  Look, or view. (K, TA.)
It is said in the Kur [xx. 40], وَالتُصْنَعَ عَلَى عَيْنِى,
(S, TA,) and it has been expl. as there having
this meaning [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  And this I did that thou
mightest be reared and nourished in my view], as
in the B; or, as Th says, that thou mightest be
reared where I should see thee: (TA:) or the
meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  in my watch, or guard, (Bd, * Jel,)
and my keeping, or protection. (Jel. [It is implied
by the context in the S, that عَلَى عَيْنِى is said in
this instance in relation to honouring and protecting, as it is in a phrase mentioned in the first
quarter of this paragraph; but my rendering of
it there is obviously inapplicable here. See also 1
in art. صنع.]) And in like manner it has been
expl. as used in the Kur [xi. 39], وَاصْنَعِ الْفُلْكَ
بِأَعْيُنِنَا (assumed tropical:)  [And make thou the ark in our view].
(TA.) [In like manner, also,] فَأْتُوا بِهِ عَلَى أَعْيُنِ
النَّاسِ, in the Kur [xxi. 62], means عَلَى مَنْظَرِهِمْ
(assumed tropical:)  [i. e. Then bring ye him in the view of the

of عَيْنٌ, (K,) أَعْيَانٌ signifies also ا Brothers from
the same father and mother: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:)
this brotherhood is termed ↓ مُعَايَنَةٌ: (S, K:) and

[And his present gift is a thing not hoped for,
like the unseen debt of which the payment is deferred by the creditor:] meaning, his present

Az. (TA.) ―

rather exactly, the same as its ذات; (TA;) [and
likewise a man's person, as does also ↓ عِيَانٌ, (see
exs. in Har pp. 20 and 45,) and the material substance of a thing;] and its أَصْل [as meaning its
essence, or constituent substance]: (TA:) pl. أَعْيَانٌ,

TA.) One says, هُوَ هُوَ عَيْنًا and هُوَ هُوَ بِعَيْنِهِ (assumed tropical:)  (It

certain future period with something additional

of such payment: or a sort of sale in which the
price is paid in advance, and the commodity is

cases used in one or another of the senses expl. in
what here follows]. (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA.) And

or it is the case of a man's coming to another
man to ask of him a loan, which the latter does
not desire to grant, coveting profit, which is not to
be obtained by a loan, wherefore he says, “I will
sell to thee this garment for twelve dirhems upon
credit, for payment at a certain time, and its
value is ten [which thou mayest obtain by selling
it for ready money]. ” (KT: in some copies of
which the word thus expl. is [erroneously] written

evident, manifest, open, or public: thus, by the
Pers. word اَشْكَارْ, the KL explains عيان, which,
in my copy of that work, is written عَيَان, evidently, I think, a mistranscription for عِيَان, an
inf. n. of 3, used in the sense of a pass. part. n.,

AA, the لُؤْمَة, i. e. the سِنَّة [or share] with which
the earth is ploughed up, is called the عِيَان when

thoroughly cooked), and also by what here fel-lows]: (S, L, K. TA:) these [arrows] being

to a ?? i. q. ??: (K) [i. e. accord. to the TK.
which is followed by Freytag, applied to a rhyme

[accord. to the TK as an epithet applied to land,
and meaning (assumed tropical:)  Black likened to the eye of the

conjectural; and ا rather think that it is so, and
that by خَضْرآءِ is here meant (assumed tropical:)  a bucket with which
water has been drawn long, so that it has become
green or blackish; (see أَخْضرْ,) agreeably with
the following explanation, which is immediately
subjoined in the K]. ―

مَعِينٌ Smitten with the [evil] eye; as also
↓ مَعْيُونٌ, the complete form: (S, TA:) or,
accord. to Ez-Zejjájee, the former has this meaning, but ↓ المَعْيُونُ means اَلَّذِى فِيهِ عَيْنٌ [in which
the last word is probably a mistranscription for
عَيْبٌ; so that the meaning is, in whom is a fault,

مَعْيُونٌ, as it is an epithet (??)
Respecting the measure of مَعِينٌ, which (??)
from عَيْنُ المَآءِ. and explain as meaning (??)
the source apparent, (??)
(??) some say that it is an (??) of مَفْعُولٌ
though not having a verb; and some, that

one] having a running spring, (that was not (??)
entirely exhausted,] معينا is made masc. to (??)
with the word [??, which is masc. in form though
fem. by usage]; or it is thus because (??)
imagined to be of the measure فَعِيل, in the sense
of the measure مَفْعُول; or because it is for
ذَاتَ مَعِينٍ, i. e. [having] water running upon the
