عندلبعَنْدَلِيبٌ, of the measure فَعْلَلِيلٌ, as AHei says,
the ن being radical; though some say that it is of
the measure فَنْعَلِيلٌ, making the ن augmentative;
(MF, TA;) A certain bird, called هَزَار [q. v.];
(S, O, Msb, K;) or هَزَارْ دَسْتَانْ; (O;) or, as in
the “ Sifr es-Sa'ádeh,” a small passerine bird,
called هَزَار دَاسْتَان; (TA;) which is Pers., (O,
TA,) meaning “ a thousand notes ” or “ voices,”
(O,) or “ a thousand tales; ” (TA;) confirming
a saying of Lth, accord. to whom, (O,) it is a
bird that utters various notes, (O, Msb, K,) of the
passerine kind; said by some to be the بُلْبُل [i. e.
the nightingale, or a certain melodious bird resembling the nightingale]: (Msb:) said by Az to
be originally عَنْدَلِيلٌ: (O:) pl. عَنَادِلُ; (S, O,
Msb, K;) because you reduce it to a quadriliteral, and then form from it the pl. and the
dim. [which latter is عُنَيْدِلٌ]. (S, O.)
