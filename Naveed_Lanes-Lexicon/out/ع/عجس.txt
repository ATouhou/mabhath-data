عَجِسَ,] inf. n. عَجْسٌ, (S,
O,) He grasped it; (S, O, K;) namely, a thing
[such, for ex., as a bow]: (S:) [and he grasped
it hard; for] عَجْسٌ signifies also the grasping a
thing hard. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And عَجَسَهُ عَنْ حَاجَتِهِ,
aor. as above, (O, K,) and so the inf. n., (O,)
He, or it, withheld him from the object of his
want; (O, K;) as also ↓ تعجّسهُ: (TA:) and
↓ تعجّسهُ is likewise said of a radical, or hereditary, evil quality, meaning It withheld him from
generous actions; (Sh, O, K;) as also تعقّلهُ and
تثفّلهُ. (Sh, O.) And عَجَسَنِى عَنْكَ It (an affair,
or event,) withheld me from thee. (AO, O.)
And بِهِمْ ↓ تعجّس He withheld them; and he
held them back, or made them slow or tardy:
(Sh, O, K: *) and one says, بِىَ الرَّاحِلَةُ ↓ تَعَجَّسَتْ
The riding-camel kept me back, or made me slow
or tardy. (TA.) ―
-b3-  عَجَسَ and ↓ تعجّس alone
signify He was, or became, slow, tardy, late, or
backward: (TA:) and the latter signifies [likewise] he was, or became, behind, or backward;
or he remained behind, or held back. (O, TA.)
―
-b4-  And one says of a she-camel, عَجَسَتْ بِهِ, (O,
K,) aor. as above, (K,) and so the inf. n., (TA,)
meaning She turned aside, or away, with him

-b4-  And تعجّس
أَمْرَهُ He searched repeatedly after the knowledge
of his (i. e. another's S, O) affair, or case. (S,
O, K.) Hence, in a trad., فَيَتَجَّسُكُمْ فِى قُرَيْشٍ

تعجّس الرَّجُلُ The man went forth in a last
portion, before daybreak, (↓ بِعِجْسَةٍ, O, or
↓ بِعُجْسَةٍ, K, [but see what follows,]) of the
night: (O, K:) El-Marrár Ibn-Sa'eed El-Fak'asee
says, describing his travelling-companions,
وَإِذَا هُمُ ارْتَحَلُوا بِلَيْلٍ حَابِسٍ
↓ المُتَعَجِّسِ ↓ أُخْرَى النُّجُومِ بِعَجْسَةِ
[And when they departed in an impeding night,
in the last period of the appearance of the stars,
in a last portion of the night of him who goes
forth at that time]. (O: in which بعجسة is thus
written, with fet-h and damm, and with مَعًا
above them.) [It is also said in the O (immediately after this verse), and likewise in the K and
TA (in neither of which is the verse cited), in all
of them probably from one and the same source,
that ↓ المُتَعَجِّسُ means المُتَشَمْخِرُ; and it is
added in the TA that this has been mentioned in
its place: but it is not mentioned in its proper
art. in the O nor in the K nor in the TA; and
it is evidently a mistranscription, for المُسْتَحِرُ,
part. n. of اِسْتَحَرَ (q. v. voce أَسْحَرَ), and therefore I have rendered المُتَعَجِّس as above.]
عَجْسٌ and ↓ عُجْسٌ and ↓ عِجْسٌ The handle,
or part that is grasped by the hand, of a bow;
(S, O, K, TA;) which is the part, thereof, that

[lit. the place of grasping]. (S, O, K.) ―
-b2-  And,
(K,) or the first of these words, (S, O,) A
portion of the middle of the night; (S, O, K;)

one says, مَضَى عَجْسٌ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ [A portion of
the middle of the night passed]: (S, O:) or the
last part of the night: (Lth, O, K:) or the

words are written in the K in this art. like
أَمِير, with a reference to art. سجس, but the latter
of them is correctly عُجَيْس, in the dim. form,
(TA,) mean I will not come to thee ever; (S,
O;) or while time lasts. (TA.) And one says
