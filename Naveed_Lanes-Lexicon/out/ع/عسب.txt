عَسْبٌ A stallion's covering, or compressing: (S,
A, Mgh, O, K:) [in this sense an inf. n.: (see

man: (TA:) or (so in the A and K; but in the
S, “and, it is said,” ) his sperma; (S, A, K, TA;)
that of a horse or of a camel; in which sense it
has no verb: (TA:) or his progeny: and offspring; syn. وَلَدٌ; (A, O, K;) [app. of human
beings; for it is added by SM that,] in this sense,
it is, accord. to some, tropical. (TA.) One says,
قَطَعَ اللّٰهُ عَسْبَهُ, (A, TA,) meaning [God cut short,
or may God cut short,] his progeny, (A,) or his
sperma and his progeny. (TA.) And Kutheiyir

تَخُصُّ بِهِ أُمُّ الطَّرِيقِ عِيَالَهَا
[They leave behind them the offspring of ElWálikee and Násih: the hyena appropriates

have been stripped off: and one upon which leaves
have not grown: (K:) or the part, of a palmbranch, a little above the كَرَب [or lower, thick,
and broad, portions,] upon which no leaves have
grown; that [or those parts] upon which leaves
have grown being termed سَعَفٌ: (S, O:) pl. [of
mult.] عُسُبٌ, (O, Msb, TA,) with two dammehs,
(TA,) and عُسْبَانٌ (Msb, TA) and عِسْبَانٌ and
عُسُوبٌ and [of pauc.] أَعْسِبَةٌ. (TA.) It is said
of the Prophet, in a trad., قُبِضَ وَالقُرْآنُ فِى العُسُبِ
وَالقُضُمِ وَالكَرَانِيفِ [He was taken, i. e. he died,
while the Kur-án was written only upon leafless
palm-branches, and skins, or white skins, and
stumps of palm-branches]. (O, TA.*) ―

-b2-  And hence, (S, O,)
(tropical:)  The lord, or chief, of his people: (S, A, O:) or
a great chief; as also ↓ عَسُوبٌ; (K;) or this
signifies [simply] a lord, or chief, like يَعْسُوبٌ:
(O:) pl. يَعَاسِيبُ. (TA.) It is said in a trad. of
'Alee, When such and such things shall happen
(mentioning factions, or seditions), ضَرَبَ يَعْسُوبُ
الدِّينِ بِذَنَبِهِ; (A, O, TA;) in which, accord. to
As, يعسوب الدين means the chief of men in
respect of religion at that time; (TA;) or it
means the leader of the religion: (T and TA in
art. ضرب:) and it is said that ضرب بذنبه here
means shall quit the faction, or sedition, and its
party, with his partisans in religion; by ذنبه
being meant his followers; and by ضرب, shall go
away through the land, journeying, or warring in
the cause of the religion: or , as Z says, ضرب
بذنبه means (tropical:)  shall remain, and be firm, together
with his religious followers; and accord. to Aboo-Sa'eed, the same is said of the locust, when it
lays its eggs, thrusting its tail into the ground;
and the meaning here is, (assumed tropical:)  shall remain firm until
the people shall return to him, and the religion
become manifest, and spread abroad. (TA. [See
also ضَرَبَ and ذَنَبٌ.]) ―
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  Gold; so called
because it is that by means of which an affair is
managed, or ordered: and [in a larger sense]
a thing to which one has recourse for protection
or the like; as in a saying of 'Alee, in which
wealth is termed the يعسوب of the unbelievers
or of the hypocrites. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And A certain
flying thing, smaller than the locust; (As,
A'Obeyd, K;) or larger; (K;) and having a
long tail: (TA:) or a certain flying thing, longer
than the locust, that does not contract its wings
when it alights; to which a horse is likened for
the slenderness of its body: (S, O:) or a kind of
moth, or the like, (فَرَاشَةٌ,) of a greenish colour,
that flies in the [season called] رَبِيع. (IAth, TA.)

quaternis pennis volucre, mordella Gazæ, seu orsodacna Aristot. ” ] ―

white mark, on a horse's face, (K, TA,) of a long

in the part of the flank of a horse where the rider
strikes it with his foot: (O, K, TA:) but Az
says that this is a mistake, and that the correct
meaning is that given above on the authority of
A'Obeyd. (TA.) ―
-b8-  The ى in يَعْسُوبٌ is augmentative; because there is no Arabic word of
the measure فَعْلُولٌ except صَعْفُوقٌ. (S, O.)
