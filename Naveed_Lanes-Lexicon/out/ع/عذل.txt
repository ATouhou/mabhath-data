عذل1
عَذَلَهُ, (S, Msb,) aor.
عَذُلَ (S, O, Msb) and
عَذِلَ,
(Msb,) inf. n. عَذْلٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) He blamed
him, or censured him; (S, O, Msb, K; *) [and
↓ عذّلهُ he did so much; for] تَعْذِيلٌ is like عَذْلٌ,
signifying مَلَامَةٌ, (K, TA,) [and تَعْذَالٌ is a dial.
var. thereof, occurring in the Mo'allakah of Imra-el-Keys, (see EM p. 33,)] but its verb has
teshdeed to denote muchness. (TA.) سَبَقَ السَّيْفُ
العَذْلَ [The sword preceded the censure] is a prov.
[expl. voce شَجْنٌ]. (TA.) Accord. to IAar,
[عَذَلَهُ may signify as above; or he afflicted,
annoyed, or hurt, him; for he says,] العَذْلُ
signifies الإِحْرَاقُ; [perhaps meaning الإِحْرَاقُ
بِاللِّسَانِ; for SM adds,] as though the censurer
burned (يُحْرِقُ) by his عَذْل the object thereof:
(TA:) [or it may mean also he burned him; for
Sgh says,] and العَذْلُ signifies also الإِحْرَاقُ. (O.)

O, Msb:) or i. q. قَبِلَ المَلَامَةَ [he admitted, or
accepted, blame, or censure]; as also ↓ تعذّل:
(K:) [or, accord. to SM,] one says, اعتذل الرَّجُلَ
and ↓ تعذّل as meaning قَبِلَ مِنْهُ المَلَامَةَ وَأَعْتَبَ
[i. e. he admitted, or accepted, blame, or censure,
from the man, and reverted; but I think that
the right reading is الرَّجُلُ, and that منه should
be erased]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also He shot, or cast, a
second time; (ISk, O, K;) having shot, or cast,
and missed: (ISk, O:) or, accord. to the A, he

And i. q. اِعْتَزَمَ [perhaps said of a man, and
meaning He kept to the course, or right course, in
running, or walking, &c.: but more probably, I
think, said of a horse, meaning he went along
overcoming his rider, in his running, not complying with his desire when he pulled him in]: (K:)

went quickly, after slowness, and strove, or exerted
himself. (O.) ―

عَذَلٌ Blame, or censure: a subst., as distinguished from the inf. n. عَذْلٌ. (O, K.)
أَيَّامٌ عُذُلٌ: see مُعْتَذِلَاتٌ, in two places.
عُذَلَةٌ One who blames, or censures, others much
or often; (S, O, K;) an epithet like ضُحَكَةٌ and
هُزَأَةٌ; (S;) [and ↓ عَذُولٌ is used in the same
sense, agreeably with analogy, but is perhaps
post-classical;] as also ↓ عَذَّالٌ; (K;) and this
last with ة is applied in this sense to a woman.
(TA.) Hence the prov., أَنَا عُذَلَةٌ وَأَخِى خُذَلَةٌ
وَكِلَانَا لَيْسَ بِابْنِ أَمَةٍ [lit. I am one who blames
others much, and my brother is one who constantly
abstains from rendering aid, and neither of us is
a son of a female slave; but expl. as] meaning I
blame my brother, and he abstains from aiding
me. (TA.)

censurer: (TA:) pl. عَذَلَةٌ and عُذَّالٌ and عُذَّلٌ;
(K, TA;) all pls. of عَاذِلٌ: the fem., applied to
a woman, is عَاذِلَةٌ; and the pl. of this is عَوَاذِلُ,
and عَاذِلَاتٌ is allowable. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And العَاذِلُ
signifies (assumed tropical:)  The vein from which flows the blood
called that of الاِسْتِحَاضة [inf. n. of اُسْتُحِيضَتْ,
q. v., in art. حيض]; (S, O, Msb, K, TA;) as
though it were so called because the woman becomes liable to be blamed by her husband; the
blaming being attributed to the vein by reason
of its being the cause thereof: (O:) and sometimes it is called العَاذِرُ [q. v.]: (Msb, TA: *) the
pl. is عُذُلٌ, like شُرُفٌ pl. of شَارِفٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-
عَاذِلٌ was The name of [the month] شَعْبَانُ in the
Time of Ignorance: (K, * TA:) or of شَوَّالٌ;

come before the [auroral] rising of Suheyl [i. e.
Canopus], or after it; so called as [though]
meaning that they blame one another (↓ يَتَعَاذَلْنَ),

desist from heat: and also called مُعْتَدِلَات [q. v.],
with the unpointed د, as being equal in intensity
of heat. (TA.)
