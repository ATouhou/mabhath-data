عقو1
عَقَا الأَمْرَ, aor. يَعْقُو, and [عَقَى, aor.] يَعْقِى,
He disliked, or hated, the thing, or affair. (K.)
-A2-  And عَقَاهُ, aor. يَعْقُوهُ, is syn. with عَاقَهُ [meaning He, or it, hindered, prevented, impeded, or
withheld, him], being formed from the latter by
transposition; (S, TA;) i. q. حَبَسَهُ; as also
↓ اعتقاهُ; (TA;) [and this is app. meant by its
being said that] الاِعتِقَآءُ is syn. with الاِحْتِبَاسُ,
and is formed by transposition from الاِعْتِيَاقُ. (S,
TA.)
