عرجنQ. 1
عَرْجَنَهُ He struck him, or beat him, with
an عُرْجُون [q. v.]. (S, K.) And عَرْجَنَهُ بِالعَصَا
He struck him, or beat him, with the staff, or
stick. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And He figured it (i. e. a garment, or piece of cloth,) with the forms of عَرَاجِين,
pl. of عُرْجُونٌ. (K.) ―
-b3-  And He smeared, or
rubbed over, him, or it, with blood, or with
saffron, or with خِضَاب [i. e. hinnà, or the
like]. (K.)
عُرْجُونٌ A raceme of a palm-tree, or of dates;
syn. عِذْقٌ: or, when it has become dry and curved:
(K:) or the base, or lower part, (أَصْل, S, K, and
also A and Mgh and Msb in art. عرج [because
the ن is therein regarded as augmentative],) of
the عِذْق (S, K) or كِبَاسَة [which signifies the
same as عِذْق], (A, Mgh, Msb,) which curves,
and from which the fruit-stalks are cut off, and
which then remains upon the palm-tree, dry: (S:)
or the عُود [meaning main stem] of the كِبَاسَة:
(Th, K:) Az says, it is yellow and broad: [but
it is the contrary of broad in comparison with its
length:] and in the Kur xxxvi. 39, the moon
when it has become slender [in appearance, towards the end of the lunar month,] is likened to
the old عُرْجُون, in respect, as ISd says, of its
slenderness and curvature: (TA:) [in the TA
voce سُبَاطَةٌ, the pl. عَرَاجِينُ is strangely used as
meaning the fruit-stalks of the raceme of a palmtree:] بَنَاتُ عُرْجُونٍ signifies the fruit-stalks of a
raceme of dates: (T in art. بنى:) [it is said
that] the ن of عُرْجُونٌ, though this word imports
the meaning of اِنْعِرَاجٌ [or “ a state of bending ”],
is shown to be radical by the word مُعَرْجَنٌ, occurring in a verse of Ru-beh, and also by the fact that
there is no verb of the measure فَعْلَنَ. (TA. [But
عَشْرَنَ and سَبْعَنَ, though these are said to be
post-classical, and, accord. to some, عَلْوَنَ, may
be mentioned, and perhaps some other, as being
of this measure.]) ―
-b2-  Also A certain plant, (K,
TA,) white, accord. to Th, (TA,) like the فُطْر [or
toadstool], resembling the فِقْع [a white and soft
sort of كَمْء], (K, TA,) which dries, having a
round form: or a species of the كَمْأَة, of the
measure of a span, or a little less than that;
good, or pleasant, while fresh: (TA:) pl.
عَرَاجِينُ. (K.)
مُعَرْجَنٌ, occurring in a verse of Ru-beh, (TA,)
A garment, or piece of cloth, in which are
[figured] the forms of عَرَاجِين [pl. of عُرْجُونٌ].
(A and TA in art. عرج.)
