عطن1
عَطَنَتِ الإِبِلُ (S, Msb, K) or عَطَنَتِ الإِبِلُ
عَلَى المَآءِ, (TA,) aor.
عَطِنَ and
عَطُنَ, inf. n. عُطُونٌ, (S,
Msb, K,) The camels lay down [at the water]
after having satisfied their thirst; (S, Msb, * K;)
as also ↓ عَطَّنَت: (K:) and العُطُونُ, (K, TA,) it
is said, (TA,) signifies the resting, or the driving
back to the nightly resting-place, a she-camel after
her drinking: (K, TA:) or the bringing her back
to the عَطَن [q. v.], waiting in expectation with
her, because she did not drink the first time, (so
in the K accord. to the TA, but in the CK,
agreeably with the S, this last meaning is
made to relate to 4, q. v.,) then offering her the
water a second time: (K, TA:) or it signifies
[agreeably with the first explanation above] her
satisfying her thirst, then lying down: (K, * TA:)
in which explanation, in [some of the copies of]
the K, ثم تنرك is erroneously put for ثُمَّ تَبْرُك.
(TA.) قَدْ عَطَنُوا مَوَاشِيَهُمْ occurs in a trad. as
meaning They had rested, or had driven back to
the nightly resting-place, their cattle. (TA.)
-A2-
عَطَنَ الجِلْدَ, aor.
عَطِنَ (S, K) and
عَطُنَ, (K,) inf. n.
عَطْنٌ, (S,) He took عَلْقَى, which is a certain
plant, (S,) so says J, but, as 'Alee Ibn-Hamzeh
says, it is the غَلْقَة, a well-known plant, not the
عَلْقَى, that is used for this purpose, (IB, TA,)
[or perhaps عَلْقَى is a mistranscription for غَلْقَى,
which is said in the K in art. غلق to be a syn. of
غَلْقَةٌ,] or فَرْث [i. e. the feces thus termed], or
salt, and threw the skin into it, and covered it
over, in order that its wool might become dissundered and loose; after which it is thrown into the
tan: (S:) or, as also ↓ عطّنهُ, he put the skin into
the tan, and left it so that it became corrupt and
stinking: (K:) or he sprinkled water upon it, (K,
TA,) and folded it, (TA,) and buried it (K, TA)
for a day and a night, (TA,) so that its hair
(K, TA) or its wool, (TA,) became loose; in
order that it might be plucked off; (K, TA;)
and that it [the skin] might be then thrown into
the tan, it being then stinking in the utmost
degree: (TA:) or العَتْنُ signifies the putting [a
skin] into the tan. (Az, TA.)
-A3-  عَطِنَ, aor.
عَطَنَ,
(S, K,) inf. n. عَطَنٌ, (S,) said of a hide, It became stinking, and its wool fell off, in the process
termed عَطْن [expl. above]: (AZ, S, TA:) or it
was put into the tan, and left so that it became
corrupt and stinking: (K:) or water was sprinkled
upon it, (K, TA,) and it was folded, (TA,) and
buried (K, TA) for a day and a night, (TA,) so
that its hair (K, TA) or its wool (TA) became
loose; in order that it might be plucked off; (K,
TA;) and that it [the skin] might be then thrown
into the tan, it being then stinking in the utmost
degree: (TA:) and ↓ انعطن signifies the same:
(S, K:) or this signifies it (a skin) became loose
in its wool without becoming corrupt. (AHn,
TA.)
2
عطّن, inf. n. تَعْطِينٌ, He made for himself
an عَطَن [q. v.]: (K, TA:) like as one says of a
bird عشّش, meaning “ he made for himself an
عُشّ ” [i. e. “ a nest ”]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  عطّنت الإِبِلُ:
see 1, first sentence.
-A2-  عطّن الجِلْدَ: see 1, near
the middle.

اعطن القَوْمُ means عَطَنَتْ إِبِلُهُمْ [The people,
or party, had their camels lying down at the water
after having satisfied their thirst: see 1, first
sentence]. (S, K.)
-A2-  اعطن الإِبِلَ He watered
the camels and then made them to lie down [at the
water]: (S, TA:) or he confined the camels at the
water, and they lay down, after having come to it
[and drunk], (K, TA,) in order that they might
drink again: (TA:) this the Arabs do only in
the intense heats of summer; not when the season
becomes cool: (Msb:) or they do this only when
the asterism of the Pleiades (الثُّرَيَّا) rises [auro-
rally, i. e. about the middle of May, O. S.], and
men return from the seeking after herbage to the
places of waters, or of constant sources of water:
they do so only on the day of the camels' coming
to the water; and they cease not to do thus [when
necessary] until the time of the [auroral] rising
of Canopus (سُهَيْل [i. e. early in August, O. S.]),
in the خَرِيف, [app. here meaning the period of
the rain so called, (see the latter of the two tables
in page 1254,)] after which they do it not, but
the camels come to the water and drink their
draught and return from the water: (Az, TA:)
or اعطن الإِبِلَ signifies he brought back the camels
to the عَطَن [q. v.], waiting in expectation with
them, because they did not drink the first time.
(So in the CK [agreeably with what here follows;
but see 1, first sentence].) And one says, اعطن
الرَّجُلُ بَعِيرَهُ The man brought back his camel to
the عَطَن, waiting in expectation with him, he not
having drunk. (S.)

إِنْعَطَنَ see 1, last sentence.
عَطَنٌ and ↓ مَعْطِنٌ (ISk, S, Mgh, Msb, K) or
مَعْطَنٌ (TA [but this I find not elsewhere]) The
usual abiding-place of camels: (K:) and also,
(K, TA,) by predominance of usage, (TA,) or
only, (Az, Msb, TA,) the place of camels, where
they lie down, (Az, S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) at the
water, (Az, S, TA,) or around the water, (Mgh,
Msb,) or around the watering-trough, (K, TA,)
in order that they may drink a second time, after
the first draught, and then be sent back to the
places of pasture to remain there during the intervals between the waterings; (S;) and likewise
the places of sheep or goats, where they lie down
around the water: (ISk, S, Msb, K, TA:) pl. of
the former أَعْطَانٌ; and of the latter ↓ مَعَاطِنُ;
(Az, S, Mgh, Msb, K;) which latter pl. is used
by the lawyers as meaning [generally] the places
of lying down of camels. (Msb.) The [space
called] حَرِيم [q. v.] of the well of the عَطَن is
said to be forty cubits. (Mgh.) Prayer in the
أَعْطَان of camels is forbidden, because the person
praying is not secure from being hurt by them,
and diverted from his prayer, and defiled by the
sprinkling of their urine. (IAth, TA.) ضَرَبَتِ
الإِبِلُ بِعَطَنٍ [in which الأَرْضَ is understood after
الابل] means The camels lay down [in a place by
the water]: (S:) or satisfied themselves with
drinking and then lay down around the water or
by the watering-troughs, to be brought again to
drink another time. (IAth, TA.) And one says,
ضَرَبَتِ النَّاقَةُ بِعَطَنٍ The she-camel lay down [&c.].
(TA.) And ضَرَبَ النَّاسُ بِعَطَنٍ (assumed tropical:)  The people's
camels satisfied themselves with drinking until they
lay down and remained in their place [at the
water]; occurring in a trad.: (TA in art. ضرب:)
or the people satisfied their thirst and then abode
at the water. (K and TA in the present art.) ―
-b2-
[Hence] one says, فُلَانٌ وَاسِعُ العَطَنِ وَالبَلَدِ, (S,)
or رَحْبُ العَطَنِ, (K, TA,) (tropical:)  Such a one is a
person possessing much wealth; having an ample
dwelling or place of abode; (K, TA;) endowed
with extensive power or strength or might; or
liberal, munificent, or generous. (S, K, TA.)
-A2-
And العَطَنُ signifies العِرْضُ [app. as meaning
Odour, from the same word as inf. n. of عَطِنَ
said of a hide]: so in the saying of 'Adee Ibn-Zeyd, cited by Sh,
طَاهِرُ الأَثْوَابِ يَحْمِى عِرْضَهُ
مِنْ حَنَا الذِّمَّةِ أَوْ طَمْثِ العَطَنْ
[Pure in conduct, or actions; he guards his
honour, or reputation, from unseemliness in respect
of that which should be held sacred, or inviolable,
or filthiness of odour]. (TA)
عَطِنٌ part. n. of عَطِنَ [q. v.] said of a hide.
(S, TA.) [Hence,] أُهُبٌ عَطِنَةٌ Stinking hides.
(TA.)
عَطَنَةٌ a subst. from أَعْطَنَ الإِبِلَ [q. v., as such
signifying The watering of camels and then
making them to lie down at the water: or the
confining of camels at the water, where they lie
down, after having come to it and drunk]. (K.)
-A2-  Also The place of [the operation termed]
العَطْن [inf. n. of عَطَنَ in the phrase عَطَنَ الجِلْدَ,
q. v.]. (AZ, TA.)
عِطَانٌ Feces such as are termed فَرْث, or salt, which
one puts in, or upon, a hide, [in preparing it for
tanning,] in order that it may not stink. (K.)
عَطِينٌ i. q. مَعْطُونٌ, q. v., applied to a skin.
(K.) ―
-b2-  And (hence, TA), as also ↓ عَطِينَةٌ, applied to a man, Stinking (K, TA) in the exterior
of the skin: or the latter, blamed in respect of
some foul affair. (TA.)
عَطِينَةٌ: see what next precedes.
عَاطِنَةٌ, (S, K,) applied to a she-camel, (K,) or
to camels, (S, Msb,) as also [the pls.] عَوَاطِنُ (S,
Msb, K) and عُطُونٌ, (K,) but not عُطَّانٌ thus
applied, (TA,) Lying down [at the water] after
having satisfied her, or their, thirst. (S, Msb, *
K.) ―
-b2-  And عُطَّانٌ and عُطُونٌ and عَطَنَةٌ (K, TA)
and عَاطِنُونَ (TA) [all pls. of عَاطِنٌ] Men who
have alighted, or descended and abode, in مَعَاطِن
[pl. of مَعْطِنٌ]. (K, TA.)
مَعْطِنٌ; and its pl. مَعَاطِنُ: see عَطَنٌ.
مَعْطُونٌ A skin prepared for tanning in the
manner signified by the phrase عَطَنَ الجِلْدَ, expl.
above; (S, K;) as also ↓ عَطِينٌ. (K.)
