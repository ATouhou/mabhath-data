to Lh, the last signifies one of the sorts of variegated, or figured, cloths [that serve for the coverings] of the [women's camel-vehicles called] هَوَادِج;

[which I can only conjecture to mean “ when he turns
his adversary in a dispute from the right point: ”
the difficulty in the phrase lies in the verb, which
I think to be more probably يُلْوِى than يَلْوِى:
