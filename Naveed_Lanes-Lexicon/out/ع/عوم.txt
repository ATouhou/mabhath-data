عَامَ فِى المَآءِ, (Mgh, Msb,) aor. يَعُومُ, (Msb,)
inf. n. عَوْمٌ, (S, Msb, K,) He swam in the water;
syn. سَبَحَ: (Mgh:) العَوْمُ signifying السِّبَاحَةُ: (S,
K:) or, accord. to the author of the “ Iktitáf,”
the former signifies the coursing along in water
with immersion of oneself; and the latter, “the
coursing along upon water without immersion of
oneself: ” [but see what follows:] or, as some
say, the former is an act of rational beings, and
the latter is of irrational; but Bd, on the words
كُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ [in the Kur xxi. 34], says
that السِّبَاحَةُ is the act of rational beings. (MF,
TA.) It is said in a trad., عَلِّمُوا صِبْيانَكُمُ العَوْمَ
[Teach ye your young boys swimming]. (TA.)
And one says, العَوْمُ لَا يُنْسَى [Swimming once
learned will not be forgotten]. (S, TA.) ―

عوّم السَّفِينَةَ, inf. n. تَعْوِيمٌ, He made the ship
to swim [or float] in [or upon] the sea. (TA.)
-A2-  [J cites immediately after explaining عَامَةٌ in

وَعَامَةٍ عَوَّمَهَا فِى الهَامَةِ
[Many a turn or twist, of a turban, which he
turned, or twisted, upon the head]. (S.) ―

-A3-  See also the
next paragraph, in two places.

عاومهُ, (Lh, K, TA,) inf. n. مُعَاوَمَةٌ and
عِوَامٌ, He hired him, or tock him as a hired man
or hireling, for the year: (Lh. TA:) or he made
an engagement, or a contract, with him for work
or the like, by the year (K:) or you say, عَامَلَهُ
مُعَاوَمَةً; like as you say, مُشَاهَرَةً; (S, Msb:) the
former from العَامُ, and the latter from الشَّهْرُ; &c.
(Msb.) The مُعَاوَمَة that is forbidden is The
setting the seed-produce of one's year, (S, K, TA,)
or the dates of one's palm-trees, or ones trees, for
two years, or three, (so in one of my copies of the
S,) or for what will come forth in the next following year: or, as in the Nh, the selling the fruit of
one's palm-trees or of one's grape-nines or of one's
[other] trees for two years, or three, and more
than that; (TA:) or one's extending to a man
the term of a debt that has become due by him and
his increasing the amount of the debt: (Lh, TA:)
or one's adding somewhat to a debt and deferring it
(K.) ―
-b2-  And عاومت السَّخْلَةُ The palm-tree bore
one year and did not bear another year: (S, K:)
like سَانَهَت: (As, in K and TA, art. سنه.) as
also ↓ عُوُّمَت: (K:) and الكَرْمُ ↓ عَوَّمَ, inf. n. تَعْوِيمٌ,
The grape-vine bore much one year and little
another, (TA, [See also مُعْوِمٌ; perhaps a mistranscription for مُعَوِّمُ.]) ―
-b3-  Also (i. e. عاومت
النخلة The palm-tree completed a year [of
growth]. (Z. TA.)
4
الدَّارُ اعامت The house, or dwelling, became
altered, or changed, and years passed over it;
like احالت. (TA in art. حول.)
عَامٌ A year syn. سَنَةٌ: (S, K;) or حَوْلٌ;
[not سَنَةٌ; for] El. Jawáleekee says, the common
people do not distinguish between the عام and the
سنه, making them both to have the same meaning; but the right state of the case is what I have
been told on the authority of Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà
[i. e. Th], that the سنه is from any day from
which one commences a reckoning to the like
thereof, and the عام is only [a period of] a winter
and a summer; and it is also said in the T and
in the Bári that the عام is a حَوْل that makes an
end of a winter and a summer, so that every عام is
a سنة, but every سنة is not an عام; for when you
reckon from a day to the like thereof, that is a
سنة, and there may be in it half of the summer.
and half of the winter, whereas the عام is only a
winter and a summer, without interruption: (Msb,
MF: *) Er-Rághib mentions a difference in the
uses of the words عَامٌ and سَنَةٌ [as has been stated
in art. سنو and سنى: see سَنَةٌ in that art.] and
Suh says, in the R, that the سنة is longer than
the عام; that the former is “ a single revolution
of the sun; ” and that the latter is applied to the
[twelve] Arabian months [collectively]: it is said
to be called عام because of the sun's عَوْم [or coursing] through all of its zodiacal signs [during the
period which it denotes]: (TA:) its pl. is أَعْوامٌ,
(S, Msb, K,) because the sing. is originally of
the measure فَعَلٌ [i. e. عَوَمٌ]: (Msb:) it has no
other pl. than this. (TA.) ―
-b2-  One says, لقِيتُهُ
عَامًا أَوَّلَ [I met him in a former year; generally
meaning, the year immediately preceding, or, as
we say, last year]; making the last word imperfectly decl. as being an epithet [and of the measure
of a verb]: and لَقِتُهُ عَامًا أَوَّلًا [I met him in a
year before: generally meaning the same as the
phrase preceding]; making the last word perfectly
decl. as not being an epithet [but an ad(??)
and K in art. وأل) or the meaning is, (??)
year] before this year; even if it be by a number
of years: ('Alee El-Kári, on the authority of Seer,
in a marginal note in my MS. copy of the K,
art. اول:) and one says also, accord. to AZ and
IAar, لَقَيتُهُ عَامَ الأَوَّلِ; (TA in art. وأل;) or the
is rarely said; (K and TA in that art.;) or should
not be said; (ISk, S and TA in that art.;) (??)
should one say, لَقَيتُهُ عَامَ أَوَّلَ (ISk TA in the
present art.) And [in like manner] one says,
ما رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْ عَامٌ أَوَّلُ, putting the last word in the
nom case as being an epithet, (S and K in art.
وأل,) as though he said أَوَّلُ مِنْ عَامِنَا [i. e. I have
not seen him since a year preceding this one year];
(S in that art.;) and مُذْ عَامٌ أَوَّلَ, putting the last
word in the accus. case as an adv n., (S and K *
in that art.,) as though he said مُذْ عامٌ قَبْلَ عَامِنَا
[since a year before this our year]; (S in that
art.;) and مُذْعَامًا أَوَّلَ and مُذْ عَامُ الأَوَّلِ are also
mentioned by different authors (??)in art, منذ)
And [using the dim. form] one says, لَقِتُهُ ذَاتَ
↓ العُوَيْمِ i. e. [I met him] in the course of some
years; like as one says, لَقِيتُهُ ذَاتَ الزُّمَيْنِ, and
ذَاتَ مَرَّةٍ: (S:) or the meaning is, (some few years
ago; or] three years ago or more, to ten: (AZ,
Az, TA:) and it is like the saying, لَقِيتُهُ مُنْذُ
سُنَيَّاتٍ: the fem. form is used because they mean
by it مَرَّة وَاحِدَة. (Az, TA.) ―
-b3-  One says also
نَاقَةٌ بَازِلُ عَامٍ and بَازِلُ عَامِهَا [A she-camel that
has passed a year, and her year, after cutting her
tush], (TA,) and بازِل عَامَيْنِ that has passed two
years after cutting the tush. (MF and TA in
art. بزل.)
-A2-  See also عَامَةٌ, in two places.
-A3-  It
is also said in the K that العَامُ signifies النَّهَارُ: but
this is a mistake and a mistranscription it is
العَيَامُ; and its place is art. عيم; as it as mentioned by Az, on the authority of El-Muärrij,
(TA.)
عَامَةٌ A [kind of float, such as is called] طَوْف
[q. v.], upon which one embarks on the water;
(S, K:) accord. to AA, a small مِعْبَر [q. v.] that
is upon rivers: (Az, TA:) in the M, said to be a
thing that is made of the branches of trees, and
the like, upon which one crosses a river, and which
tosses about upon the water the pl. is عَامَاتٌ and
عوم [app. عُومٌ, like نُوقٌ pl. of نَاقَةٌ,] and [coll.
gen. n.] ↓ عَامٌ. (TA.) [See also عَامَّةٌ, voce
عِمَامَةٌ.]
-A2-  Also The head of a ruler, or of a rider
upon a camel, (هَامَةُ رَاكِبٍ,) when it appears to
thee in the [desert, or plain, called] صَحْرَآء, (K.
TA,) as he is journeying: (TA:) or it is not
thus called unless having upon it a turban. (K,
TA.) ―
-b2-  And A turn, or twist, of a turban. (S,
K.) [See 2, second sentence.] ―
-b3-  And A quantity
of reaped corn put, or placed, in handfuls: pl.
[or rather coll. gen. n.] ↓ عَامٌ. (S, K.)
عُومَةٌ A certain insect (دُوَيْبَّة, S, K) that swims
in the water, resembling a black فَصّ [or stone of
a ring], smooth and round: (S:) pl. عُوَمٌ. (S,
K.) ―
-b2-  And A species of serpents, in 'Omán.
(TA.)
عَامِيٌّ a rel. n., from عَامٌ; (Msb, TA;) A year
old. (TA in arts. حول and دول, &c.) And
applied to a plant as meaning A year old, and
therefore dry. (Msb, TA. *) It is also applied
to a [vestige, or relic, of a dwelling, such as is
termed] رَسْم, or طَلَل, as meaning Over which a
year has passed. (TA.) And it is applied, in a
trad., as an epithet to the حَنْظَل [or colocynth,
meaning That is of service in the year of drought,
or barrenness]; because it is procured, or prepared [as an article of food], in the year of
drought, or barrenness. (TA.)
عُوَيْمٌ: see عَامٌ [of which it is the dim.], last
quarter.
عَوَّامٌ an intensive epithet from عَامَ فِي المَآءِ;
(Msb;) A man skilful in swimming. (TA.) ―
-b2-
And (assumed tropical:)  A horse that stretches forth his fore legs well
in running [like as one does the arms in swimming];
(S, Z, K, TA;) fleet, or excellent, in his running.
(TA.)
عَائِمٌ [Swimming;] part. n. of عَامَ in the phrase
عَامَ فِي المَآءِ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] سَفِينٌ عُوَّمٌ
means عَائِمَةٌ [of which عُوَّمٌ is pl.; i. e. Ships
coursing along]. (TA.)
-A2-  One says سِنُونَ عُوَّمٌ,
in which the latter word is a corroborative to the
former; (S, K; *) [app. meaning Tedious, because
severe, years;] like as one says شُغْلٌ شَاغِلٌ: as
though pl. of عَائِمٌ; but it is not used alone, because it is not a subst., being only a corroborative: (S:) or, as is said in the M, it should by
rule be عُومٌ; for [it is pl. of ↓ أَعْوَمُ, and] the pl.
of أَفْعَلُ is فُعْلٌ; but they pronounce it as above,
as though the sing. were عَامٌ عَائِمٌ: ISd says, عَامٌ
↓ أَعْوَمُ is an intensive expression, and I think that
the meaning is, [A year] that seems long to people
because of its drought, or barrenness; and similar
to it is ↓ عَامٌ مُعِيمٌ, mentioned by Lh. (TA.)
-A3-
عَائِمٌ is also [the name of] A certain idol (S, K)
of the Arabs. (S.)
عَامٌ أَعْوَمُ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
two places.
عِنَبٌ مُعْوِمٌ [perhaps a mistranscription for
↓ مُعَوِّمٌ, see 3, near the end,] means, as mentioned
by Az, on the authority of En-Nadr, [A grapevine] that bears one year and does not bear another year. (TA.)
عَامٌ مُعِيمٌ: see عَائِمٌ, last sentence but one.
[And see also art. عيم.]
شَحْمٌ مُعَوِّمٌ Fat of a year after another year.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  See also مُعْوِمٌ.
مُسْتَعَامٌ A ship upon the sea. (K.)
