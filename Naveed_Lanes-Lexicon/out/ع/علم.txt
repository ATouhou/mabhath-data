علم1
عَلِمَهُ, aor.
عَلَمَ, inf. n. عِلْمٌ, He knew it; or
he was, or became, acquainted with it; syn.
عَرَفَهُ: (S, K:) or he knew it (عَرَفَهُ) truly, or
certainly: (B, TA:) by what is said above, and
by what is afterwards said in the K, العِلْمُ and
المَعْرِفَةُ and الشُّعُورُ are made to have one meaning;
and this is nearly what is said by most of the
lexicologists: but most of the critics discriminate
every one of these from the others; and العِلْمُ,
accord. to them, denotes the highest quality, because it is that which they allow to be an attribute of God; whereas they did not say [that He
is] عَارِفٌ, in the most correct language, nor شَاعِرٌ:
(TA:) [respecting other differences between العِلْم
and المَعْرِفَة, the former of which is more general
in signification than the latter, see the first paragraph of art. عرف: much might be added to what
is there stated on that subject, and in explanation
of العِلْم, from the TA, but not without controversy:] or عَلِمَ signifies تَيَقَّنَ [i. e. he knew a
thing, intuitively, and inferentially, as expl. in the
Msb in art. يقن]; العِلْمُ being syn. with اليَقِينُ;
but it occurs with the meaning of الَمَعْرِفَةُ, like as
المَعْرِفَةُ occurs with the meaning of العلْمُ, each
being made to import the meaning of the other
because each is preceded by ignorance [when
not attributed to God]: Zuheyr says, [in his
Mo'allakah,]
وَأَعْلَمُ عِلْمَ اليَوْمِ وَالْأَمْسِ قَبْلَهُ
وَلٰكِنِّنِى عَنْ عِلْمِ مَا فِى غَدٍ عَمِ
meaning وَأَعْرِفُ [i. e. And I know the knowledge
of the present day, and of yesterday before it;
but to the knowledge of what will be to-morrow I
am blind]: and it is said in the Kur [viii. 62],
لَا تَعْلَمُونَهُمْ اَللّٰهُ يَعْلَمُهُمْ, meaning لَا تَعْرِفُونَهُمْ اَللّٰهُ
يَعْرِفُهُمْ [i. e. Ye know them not, but God knoweth
them]; المَعْرِفَة being attributed to God because
it is one of the two kinds of عِلْم, [the intuitive
and the inferential,] and the discrimination between them is conventional, on account of their
different dependencies, though He is declared to
be free from the imputation of antecedent ignorance and from acquisition [of knowledge], for
He knows what has been and what will be and
how that which will not be would be if it were,
his عِلْم being an eternal and essential attribute:
when عَلِمَ denotes اليَقِين, it [sometimes] has two
objective complements; but as syn. with عَرَفَ,
it has a single objective complement: (Msb:)
it has two objective complements in the saying,
in the Kur [lx. 10], فَإِنْ عَلِمْتُمُوهُنَّ مُؤْمِنَاتٍ [And
if ye know them to be believers]; and [in like
manner] they allowed one's saying عَلِمْتُنِى [meaning I knew myself to be], like as they said رَأَيْتُنِى
and حَسِبْتُنِى &c.: (TA:) and sometimes it imports the meaning of شَعَرَ, and is therefore followed by بِ: (Msb:) [thus] عَلِمَ بِهِ signifies شَعَرَ
or شَعُرَ (accord. to different copies of the K) [i. e.
He knew it; as meaning he knew, or had knowledge, of it; was cognizant of it; or understood
it: or he knew the minute particulars of it: or
he perceived it by means of any of the senses: and
sometimes this means he became informed, or
apprised, of it: and sometimes, he was, or became, knowing in it]: or in this case, [as meaning شَعَرْتُ بِهِ,] you say, عَلِمْتُهُ and عَلِمْتُ بِهِ [I
knew it; &c.]: (Msb:) and one says, مَا عَلِمْتُ
بِخَبَرِ قُدُومِهِ, meaning مَا شَعَرْتُ [I knew not, &c.,
the tidings of his coming, or arrival]. (TA.)
↓ اعتلمهُ, also, signifies عَلِمَهُ [He knew it; &c.].
(K.) And one says ↓ تَعَلَّمْ in the place of اِعْلَمْ
[Know thou; &c.]: ISk says, تَعَلَّمْتُ أَنَّ فُلَانًا
خَارِجٌ is a phrase used in the place of عَلِمْتُ [as
meaning I knew, or, emphatically, I know, that
such a one was, or is, going forth]; adding, [however,] when it is said to thee, اِعْلَمْ أَنَّ زَيْدًا خَارِجٌ
[Know thou that Zeyd is going forth], thou sayest
قَدْ عَلِمْتُ [lit. I have known, meaning I do know];
but when it is said, تَعَلَّمْ أَنَّ زَيْدًا خَارِجٌ, thou dost
not say, قَدْ تَعَلَّمْتُ; (S:) accord. to IB, these
two verbs are not used as syn. except in the
imperative forms: (TA:) [or] عَلِمَ الأَمْرَ and
↓ تَعَلَّمَهُ are syn. as signifying أَتْقَنَهُ [app. meaning he knew, or learned, the case, or affair,
soundly, thoroughly, or well: see art. تقن: but I
think it not improbable, though I do not find it
in any copy of the K, that the right reading may
be أَيْقَنَهُ, which is syn. with تَيَقَّنَهُ; an explanation
of عَلِمَ in the Msb, as mentioned above, being
تَيَقَّنَ]. (K, TA.) And الجَمِيعُ ↓ تعالمهُ means
عَلِمُوهُ [i. e. All knew him; &c.]. (S, K.) ―
-b2-
عَلِمْتُ عِلْمَهُ [lit. I knew his knowledge, or what
he knew, app. meaning I tried, proved, or tested,
him, and so knew what he knew; and hence I
knew his case or state or condition, or his qualities;]
is a phrase mentioned by Fr in explanation of
رَبَأْتُ فِيهِ. (TA voce رَبَأَ, q. v. See also the explanation of لَأَ خْبُرَنَّ خَبَرَكَ, in the first paragraph of
art. خبر: and see غَبَنُوا خَبَرَهَا, in art. غبن.) ―
-b3-
عَلِمْتُ is also used in the manner of a verb signifying swearing, or asseveration, so as to have a
similar complement; as in the saying,
وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْتُ لَتَأْتِيَنَّ عَشِيَّةً
[And I certainly knew that thou wouldst, or that
she would, assuredly come in the evening]. (TA
in art. شهد.) And يَعْلَمُ اللّٰهُ [God knoweth] is a
form of asseveration. (IAth, TA voce قَيْرَوَانٌ:
see an ex. in art. قير.)
-A2-  عَلُمَ, agreeably with
what is said in the M, which is عَلُمَ هُوَ نَفْسُهُ, accord. to the K عَلِمَ هُوَ فِى نَفْسِهِ, but the verb in
this case is correctly like كَرُمَ, (TA,) He was,
or became, such as is termed عَالِم and عَلِيم; (M, *
K, * TA;) meaning he possessed knowledge (العِلْم)
as a faculty firmly rooted in his mind: (IJ, *
TA:) accord. to IB, i. q. ↓ تعلّم [q. v., as intrans.]: and he was, or became, equal to the عُلَمَآء
[pl. of عَالِمٌ and of عَلِيمٌ]. (TA.)
-A3-  عَالَمَهُ فَعَلَمَهُ,
aor.
عَلُمَ: see 3.
-A4-  عَلَمَهُ, aor.
عَلُمَ and
عَلِمَ, (K,) inf. n.
عَلْمٌ, (TA.) signifies He marked it; syn. وَسَمَهُ.
(K.) And one says, عَلَمْتُ عِمَّتِى, meaning I
wound my turban upon my head with a mark
whereby its mode should be known. (TA.) [See
also 4.]
-A5-  عَلَمَ شَفَتَهُ, aor.
عَلِمَ, (S, K,) inf. n. عَلْمٌ,
(S,) He slit his [upper] lip. (S, K.)
-A6-  عَلِمَ,
aor.
عَلَمَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. عَلَمٌ, (S, Msb,) He
(a man, S) had a fissure in his upper lip: (S,
Msb, K:) or in one of its two sides. (K.)
2
علّمهُ [He, or it, made him to be such as is
termed عَالِم and عَلِيم; i. e., made him to possess
knowledge (العِلْم) as a faculty firmly rooted in
his mind: and hence, he taught him. And it
generally has a second objective complement].
You say, عَلَّمْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ [I made him to know, or
taught him, the thing], in which case the teshdeed
is [said to be] not for the purpose of denoting
muchness [of the action; but see what follows];
(S;) and عَلَّمْتُهُ الفَاتِحَةَ [I taught him the Opening
Chapter of the Kur-án], and الصَّنْعَةَ [the art, or
craft], &c.; inf. n. تَعْلِيمٌ; (Msb;) and علّمهُ
العِلْمَ, inf. n. تَعْلِيمٌ and عِلَّامٌ, the latter like
كِذَّابٌ; and إِيَّاهُ ↓ اعلمهُ; (K;) both, accord. to
the K, signifying the same [i. e. he taught him
knowledge, or science]; but Sb makes a distinction
between them, saying that عَلَّمْتُ is like أَذَّنْتُ,
and that ↓ أَعْلَمْتُ is like آذَنْتُ; and Er-Rághib
says that ↓ الإِعْلَامُ is particularly applied to quick
information; and التَّعْلِيمُ is particularly applied to
that which is repeated and much, so that an impression is produced thereby upon the mind of
the مُتَعَلِّم: and some say that the latter is the
exciting the attention of the mind to the conception
of meanings; and sometimes it is used in the
sense of الإِعْلَام when there is in it muchness:
(TA:) you say, الخَبَرَ ↓ أَعْلَمْتُهُ and بِالخْبَرِ [meaning I made known, or notified, or announced, to
him, or I told him, or I made him to know, or
have knowledge of, the news, or piece of information; I acquainted him with it; told, informed, apprised, advertised, or certified, him of it; gave
him information, intelligence, notice, or advice, of
it]: (Msb:) see also 10: [hence the inf. n. ↓ إِعْلَامٌ
is often used, as a simple subst., to signify a notification, a notice, an announcement, or an advertisement:] and sometimes ↓ اعلم has three objective complements, like أَرَى; as in the saying,
أَعْلَمْتُ زَيْدًا عَمْرًا مُنْطَلِقًا [I made known, &c., to
Zeyd that 'Amr was going away]. (I'Ak p. 117.)
―
-b2-  See also 4, in three places.
3
عَاْلَمَ ↓ عَالَمَهُ فَعَلَمَهُ, aor. of the latter
عَلُمَ, means
[I contended with him, or strove to surpass him, in
عِلْم,] and I surpassed him in عِلْم [i. e. knowledge,
&c.]: (S, K:) [the measure يَفْعَلُ,] and in like
manner the measure يَفْعِلُ, in every case of this
kind, is changed into يَفْعُلُ: so says Az: [but
see 3 in art. خصم:] and Lh mentions the phrase,
مَا كُنْتُ أَرَانِى أَنْ أَعْلُمَهُ [I did not think, or know,
that I should surpass him in knowledge]. (TA.)
4
أَعْلَمَ see 2, in six places. ―
-b2-  One says also, اعلم
الثَّوْبَ (S, Mgh, TA) He (i. e. a beater and washer
and whitener of clothes, S, Mgh) made the garment, or piece of cloth, to have a mark; (Mgh;)
or he made upon it, or in it, a mark. (TA.)
[And, said of a weaver, or an embroiderer,] He
made to the garment, or piece of cloth, a border,
or borders, of figured, or variegated, or embroidered, work, or the like. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  And
اعلم عَلَيْهِ He made, or put, or set, a mark upon
it; namely, a writing, or book, &c.: (Msb:)
[or] اعلم عَلَى مَوْضِعِ كَذَا مِنَ الكِتَابِ عَلَامَةً [He
made, &c., a mark upon such a place of the
writing, or book]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  اعلم الفَرَسَ He suspended upon the horse some coloured wool, (K,
TA,) red, or white, (TA,) in war, or battle. (K,
TA.) And اعلم نَفْسَهُ He marked himself with
the mark, sign, token, or badge, of war; as also
↓ عَلَّمَهَا. (K.) [Or] اعلم الفَارِسُ The horseman
made, or appointed, for himself, [or distinguished
himself by,] the mark, sign, token, or badge, of the
men of courage. (S.) And لَهُ عَلَامَةً ↓ عَلَّمْتُ I
appointed to him (وَضَعْتُ لَهُ) a mark, sign, or
token, which he would, or should, know. (Msb.)
―
-b5-  And القَبْرَ ↓ علّم (K in art. رجم) He put a
tombstone [as a mark] to the grave. (TK in that
art.)
-A2-  اعلم said of a well-sinker, He found the
well that he was digging to be one having much
water. (TA.)
5
تعلّم is quasi-pass. of 2 [i. e. it signifies He
was, or became, made to know, or taught; or he
learned: and is trans. and intrans.]. (S, Msb,
K, * TA.) You say, تعلّم العِلْمَ (MA, K) He
learned [knowledge, or science]. (MA.) See also 1,
latter half, in three places. [In the last of those
places, تعلّم app. signifies, as it often does, He
possessed knowledge as a faculty firmly rooted in
his mind.] Accord. to some, التَّعَلُّمُ signifies The
mind's having its attention excited to the conception
of meanings, or ideas. (TA.)
6
تعالمهُ الجَمِيعُ: see 1, latter half.
8
اعتلمهُ: see 1, latter half.
-A2-  اعتلم said of
water, It flowed (K, TA) upon the ground.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And said of lightning it means لَمَعَ فى
العلم [app. فِى العَلَمِ, and, if so, meaning It
shone, shone brightly, or gleamed, in, or upon, the
long mountain]: a poet says,
بَلْ بُرَيْقًا بِتُّ أَرْقُبُهُ
لَا يُرَى إِلَّا إِذَا اعْتَلَمَا
[But a little lightning, in watching which I passed
the night, not to be seen save when it shone, &c.].
(TA.)

استعلمهُ He asked, or desired, him to tell
him [a thing; or to make it known to him].
(MA, KL. *) You say, ↓ اِسْتَعْلَمَنِى الخَبَرَ فَأَعْلَمْتُهُ
إِيَّاهُ [He asked, or desired, me to tell him, or make
known to him, the news, or piece of information,
and I told him it, or made it known to him]. (S.)
عَلْمٌ: see مَعْلَمٌ, in two places.
عِلْمٌ is an inf. n., (S, K, &c.,) and [as such]
has no pl. [in the classical language]. (Sb, TA
voce فِكْرٌ.) [As a post-classical term, used as a
simple subst., its pl. is عُلُومٌ, signifying The
sciences, or several species of knowledge.] ―
-b2-  Sometimes it is applied to Predominant opinion; [i. e.
preponderant belief;] because it stands in stead
of that which is عِلْم properly so termed. (Ham
p. 632.) ―
-b3-  And sometimes it is used in the sense
of عَمَلٌ [A doing, &c.], as mentioned by Az, on
the authority of Ibn-'Oyeyneh, agreeably with
an explanation of عَالِمٌ as signifying one “ who
does according to his knowledge; ” and it has
been expl. as having this meaning in the Kur
xii. 68 [where the primary meaning seems to be
much more apposite]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  لَقِيتُهُ أَدْنَى عِلْمٍ
means [I met him the first thing, like لقيته أَدْنَى
دَنِّىِ and أَدْنَى دَنًا; or] before everything [else].

applied to a building raised in the beaten track
of the road, of such as are places of alighting for
travellers, whereby one is guided to the land [that
is the object of a journey]: pl. أَعْلَامٌ: and عَلَمٌ also
signifies a مَنَارَة [app. a mistranscription for مَنَار,
without ة: see these two words]. (TA. [See

or asterisms, that are signs of the way to travellers:
see مِصْبَاحٌ.] ―

lands; [like مَنَارٌ;] as also ↓ عَلَامَةٌ. (K.) [Hence,]

as a general term: or a long mountain: (K:)
[app. as forming a separation: or as being a
known sign of the way:] pl. أَعْلَامٌ and عِلَامٌ:
(K:) the former pl. occurring in the Kur [xlii.
31 and] lv. 24. (TA.) ―
-b7-  And A banner, or
standard, syn. رَايَةٌ, (S, K, TA,) to which the
soldiers congregate: (TA:) and, (K,) some say,
(TA,) the thing [i. e. flag, or strip of cloth,] that
is tied upon the spear: (K, TA:) it occurs in a
verse of Aboo-Sakhr El-Hudhalee with the
second fet-hah lengthened by an alif after it [so
that it becomes ↓ عَلَام]. (IJ, TA.) ―
-b8-  And (tropical:)  The
chief of a people or party: (K, TA:) from the
same word as signifying “ a mountain ” or “ a
banner: ” (TA:) pl. أَعْلَامٌ. (K.) ―
-b9-  [In grammar, it signifies A proper name of a person or
place &c. ―
-b10-  And the pl. أَعْلَامٌ is applied to
Things pertaining to rites and ceremonies of the
pilgrimage or the like, as being signs thereof; such
as the places where such rites and ceremonies are
performed, the beasts destined for sacrifice, and
the various practices performed during the
pilgrimage &c.; as also مَعَالِمُ, pl. of ↓ مَعْلَمٌ: the
former word is applied to such places in the Ksh
and Bd and the Jel in ii. 153; and the latter, in
the Ksh and Bd in ii. 194: the former is also
applied to the beasts destined for sacrifice in the

know, what has been and what will be; from
whom nothing is concealed in the earth nor in
the heaven; whose knowledge comprehends all

(TA.)
عَلَامَةٌ i. q. سِمَةٌ [A mark, sign, or token, by
which a person or thing is known; a cognizance,
or badge; a characteristic; an indication; a
symptom]; (K; [see also مَعْلَمٌ;]) and ↓ عَلَمٌ is
syn. therewith [as meaning thus]; (S, Msb,
TA;) and so ↓ أُعْلُومَةٌ, (Abu-l-'Omeythil ElAarábee, TA,) as in the saying ↓ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ أُعْلُومَةٌ
[Among the people, or party, is a mark, sign, or
token]; and the pl. of this last is أَعَالِيمُ: (TA:) the
pl. of عَلَامَةٌ is عَلَامَاتٌ (Msb) and [the coll.
gen. n.] ↓ عَلَامٌ, (K, TA,) differing from عَلَامَةٌ
only by the apocopating of the ة. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See
also عَلَمٌ, in two places.
عُلَامِىٌّ Light, or active; and sharp, or acute,

↓ تِعْلَامَةٌ, (K,) Very knowing or scientific or
learned: (S, K:) the ة in ↓ عَلَّامَةٌ is added to
denote intensiveness; (S;) or [rather] to denote
that the person to whom it is applied has attained
the utmost degree of the quality signified thereby;
[so that it means knowing &c. in the utmost
degree; or it may be rendered very very, or singularly, knowing or scientific or learned;] and
this epithet is applied also to a woman: (IJ,
TA:) [↓ تِعْلَامَةٌ, likewise, is doubly intensive;
and so, app., is ↓ تِعْلِمَةٌ:] the pl. of عَلَّامٌ is
عَلَّامُونَ; and that of ↓ عُلَّامٌ is عُلَّامُونَ. (TA.)
See also, for the first, عَلِيمٌ. ―
-b2-  Also the same
epithets, (K,) or عَلَّامٌ and ↓ عَلَّامَةٌ, (TA,) i. q.

عَلَّامَةٌ: see عَلَّامٌ, in four places.
عُلَّامَةٌ: see مَعْلَمٌ.
العَالَمُ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) said by some to be
also pronounced ↓ العَالِمُ, (MF, TA,) and pronounced by El-Hajjáj with hemz [i. e. العَأْلَمُ], is
primarily a name for That by means of which one
knows [a thing]; like as الخَاتَمُ is a name for
“ that by means of which one seals ” [a thing]:
accord. to some of the expositors of the Kur-án,
its predominant application is to that by means of
which the Creator is known: then to the intelligent beings of mankind and of the jinn or genii:
or to mankind and the jinn and the angels: and
mankind [alone]: Es-Seyyid Esh-Shereef [El-
Jurjánee] adopts the opinion that it is applied to
every kind [of these, so that one says عَالَمُ الإِنْسِ
(which may be rendered the world of mankind)
and عَالَمُ الجِنِّ (the world of the jinn or genii)
and عَالَمُ المَلَائِكَةِ (the world of the angels), all of
which phrases are of frequent occurrence], and
to the kinds [thereof] collectively: (TA:) or it
signifies الخَلْقُ [i. e. the creation, as meaning the
beings, or things, that are created], (S, Msb, K,)
altogether [i. e. all the created beings or things,
or all creatures]: (K:) or, as some say, peculiarly, the intelligent creatures: (Msb:) or what
the cavity (lit. belly) of the celestial sphere comprises, (K, TA,) of substances and accidents:
(TA:) [it may often be rendered the world, as
meaning the universe; and as meaning the earth
with all its inhabitants and other appertenances;
and in more restricted senses, as instanced above:
and one says عَالَمُ الحَيَوَانِ meaning the animal
kingdom, and عَالَمُ النَّبَات the vegetable kingdom, and عَالَمُ المَعَادِنِ the mineral kingdom:]
Jaafar Es-Sádik says that the عَالَم is twofold:
namely, العَالَمُ الكَبِيرُ, which is the celestial sphere
with what is within it; and العَالَمُ الصَّغِيرُ, which
is man, as being [a microcosm, i. e.] an epitome
of all that is in the كَبِير: and Zj says that العَالَمُ
has no literal sing., because it is [significant of]
a plurality [of classes] of diverse things; and if
made a sing. of one of them, it is [significant of]
a plurality of congruous things: (TA:) the pl.
is العَالَمُونَ (S, M, Msb, K, &c.) and العَوَالِمُ: (S,
TA:) and the sing. is [said to be] the only instance of a word of the measure فَاعَلٌ having a
pl. formed with و and ن, (ISd, K, TA,) except
يَاسَمٌ: (K, TA:) [but see this latter word:]
العَالَمُونَ signifies the [several] sorts of created
beings or things: (S:) [or all the sorts thereof:
or the beings of the universe, or of the whole
world:] it has this form because it includes mankind: or because it denotes particularly the sorts
of created beings consisting of the angels and the
jinn and mankind, exclusively of others: I'Ab is
related to have explained رَبُّ العَالَمِينَ as meaning
the Lord of the jinn, or genii, and of mankind:
Katádeh says, the Lord of all the created beings:
but accord. to Az, the correctness of the explanation of I'Ab is shown by the saying in the beginning of ch. xxv. of the Kur-án that the Prophet
was to be a نَذِير [or warner] لِلْعَالَمِينَ; and he
was not a نذير to the beasts, nor to the angels,
though all of them are the creatures of God; but
only to the jinn, or genii, and mankind. (TA.)
―
-b2-  عَالَمٌ is also syn. with قَرْنٌ [as meaning A
generation of mankind; or the people of one time].
(O, voce طَبَقٌ, q. v.)
عَالِمٌ and ↓ عَلِيمٌ signify the same, (IJ, Msb,
K, *) as epithets applied to a man; (K;) i. e.
Possessing the attribute of عِلْم (IJ, Msb, TA) as
a faculty firmly rooted in the mind; [or learned;
or versed in science and literature;] the former
being used in [what is more properly] the sense
of the latter; (IJ, TA;) which is an intensive
epithet: (TA:) the pl. is عُلَمَآءُ and عُلَّامٌ, (K,)
the latter of which is pl. of عَالِمٌ; (IB, TA;) the
former being [properly] pl. of عَلِيمٌ; and عَالِمُونَ
is [a] pl. of عَالِمٌ; (Msb;) [but] عُلَمَآءُ is used as
a pl. of both, (IJ, TA,) and by him who says
only عَالِمٌ [as the sing.], (Sb, TA;) because عَالِمٌ
is used in the sense of عَلِيمٌ: to him who is entering upon the study of العِلْم, the epithet ↓ مُتَعَلِّمٌ
[which may generally be rendered learning, or a
learner,] is applied; not عَالِمٌ. (IJ, TA.) عَالِمٌ
is also expl. as signifying One who does according
to his knowledge. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also عَلِيمٌ: and
أَعْلَمُ.
-A2-  And see العَالَمُ.
عَيْلَمٌ A well having much water: (S, K:) or

at him, and lo, he will be عَيْلَامٌ أَمْدَرُ [a male
hyena inflated in the sides, big in the belly, or
having his sides defiled with earth or dust]. (TA.)
عَيْلَامٌ: see the next preceding sentence.
أَعْلَمُ [More, and most, knowing or learned].
Applied to God, [it may often be rendered
Supreme in knowledge: or omniscient: but often,
in this case,] it means [simply] ↓ عَالِمٌ [in the
sense of knowing, or cognizant]. (Jel in iii. 31,
and I'Ak p. 240.) [Therefore اَللّٰهُ أَعْلَمُ virtually
means, sometimes, God knows best; or knows all
things: and sometimes, simply, God knows.]
-A2-
Also [Harelipped; i. e.] having a fissure in his
upper lip: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) or in one of its two
sides: (K:) the camel is said to be اعلم because
of the fissure in his upper lip: when the fissure is
in the lower lip, the epithet أَفْلَحُ is used: and
أَشْرَمُ is used in both of these, and also in other,
similar, senses: (TA:) the fem. of أَعْلَمُ is عَلْمَآءُ:
(S, Msb, TA:) which is likewise applied to a lip
(شَفَةٌ). (TA.) ―
-b2-  العَلْمَآءُ signifies also The coat

(K, TA;) as meaning The place in which is
known the existence of the thing: (Msb in art.
ظن:) pl. مَعَالِمُ; (TA;) which is the contr. of
مَجَاهِلُ, pl. of مَجْهَلٌ [q. v.] as applied to a land;
meaning in which are signs of the way. (TA in
art. جهل.) And hence, [A person in whom is
known the existence of a quality &c.:] one says,
هُوَ مَعْلَمٌ لِلْخَيْرِ [He is one in whom good, or goodness, is known to be]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also A thing,

which one guides himself, or is guided, (S, K, TA,)

all as far as I know, وَالعَلْمُ is here put in the
place of والعَلْمِ; whereby العَلْمُ is made to be syn.
with العَالَمُ: but accord. to SM, it is syn. with
المَعْلَمُ, as is shown by what here follows:]) and
hence a reading in the Kur [xliii. 61], ↓ وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلْمٌ
لِلسَّاعَةِ, meaning And verily he, i. e. Jesus, by his
appearing, and descending to the earth, shall be
a sign of the approach of the hour [of resurrection]: it is also said, in a trad., that on the day
