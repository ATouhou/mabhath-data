a one the son of such a one; ” and the call, or cry,

عِزَةٌ, held by some to belong to this art.: see
art. عزو.
عِزْيَةٌ: see عَزَآءٌ in art. عزو.
عَزَآءٌ Patience, or endurance; (S, K;) and عِزْوَةٌ
signifies the same, as in the saying هُوَ حَسَنُ العِزْوَةِ
[He is comely in respect of patience or endurance]:
(Ham p. 369:) or patient endurance of the loss of
anything: (TA:) or comely patience or endurance;
(K, TA;) as also تَعْزُوَةٌ accord. to the copies of
the K, but correctly ↓ تَعْزِيَةٌ [inf. n. of 2, as
though for تَعْزِيَةُ النَّفْسِ i. e. self-enjoinment, or
self-exhortation, to be patient or enduring, as is
indicated by what follows]: an Arab of the
desert, whose brother had slain a son of his, is
cited by the author of the Hamáseh as saying,
[on his brother's being brought to him that he
might retaliate upon him, (see Ham p. 100,)]
أَقُولُ لِلنَّفْسِ تأْسَآءًا وَتَعْزِيَةً
إِحْدَى يَدَىَّ أَصَابَتْنِى وَلَمْ تُرِدِ
[I say to the soul, i. e. to myself, enjoining patience
and enjoining endurance, One of my two hands
has smitten me, not desiring, or not meaning, to
do so]: (TA:) تَأْسَآءٌ is [syn. with تَأْسِيَةٌ, inf. n. of
أَسَّى,] from الإِسْوَةُ: and التَّعْزِيَةُ [signifies as rendered above; or] is derived from العَزَازُ, i. e. “ the
hard ground,” and means the strengthening of the
heart: or it is from عَزَوْتُهُ إِلَى أَبِيهِ; because the
afflicted remembers his ancestors who have gone
before him; and he means, I enjoin the soul to
endure his loss with patience, becoming consoled
by the example of others whose sons have been
slain. (Ham ubi suprà.) ―
-b2-  عَزَآءٌ is also a quasiinf. n.; like عَطَآءٌ, meaning إِعْطَآءٌ, from أَعْطَى:
(TA:) or a subst. [signifying Enjoinment, or
exhortation, to be patient: and hence, consolation: and, as often used in the present day, the
state, or ceremony, of mourning, when relations
and friends come to console the bereaved:] from
عَزَّيْتُهُ; like سَلَامٌ from سَلَّمٌ, and كَلَامٌ from كَلَّمَ.
