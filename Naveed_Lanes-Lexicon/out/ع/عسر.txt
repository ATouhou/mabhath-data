thread, غَزْلٌ, in the K قَوْلٌ [speech], but this is a
mistake, TA) became entangled, so that it could
not be unravelled; as also تغسّر, with the pointed
غ: so accord. to Lth, as related by Az, who
confirms it as of the language of the Arabs: but
Sgh, in the TS [and O], says, You say of a
thing, when it has become difficult, استعسر and
تعسّر; but of spun thread, when it has become
entangled, so that it cannot be unravelled, تغسّر,
with the pointed غ; not with the unpointed ع,
unless using a forced, or constrained, mode of
speech. (TA.)

تَعَاسَرَا [They were difficult, or hard, each
with the other; they treated, or behaved towards,
each other with hardness, harshness, or illnature;]
they disagreed, each with the other; said of a

attached her rein to her nose, and rode her. (K.)
―

without premeditation; without measuring and
preparing it in his mind. (Az, A.) ―
-b4-  اعتسر مِنْ
مَالِ وَلَدِهِ He took of the property of his son, or
child, or children, against the wish of the latter:
(S, O, K:) so occurring in a trad., with س;
from الاعتسار signifying “ the act of forcing, or
compelling: ” but accord. to one relation of that
trad., it is with ص. (TA.)

-A2-  استعسرهُ He sought,
or desired, or demanded, that in which he experienced, or would experience, difficulty. (O, K.)
عَسْرٌ, or العَسْرُ: see عِسْرٌ, in two places.
عُسْرٌ and ↓ عُسُرٌ (S, A, O, K) and ↓ عَسَرٌ (S, A,
K) and ↓ مَعْسُورٌ [respecting which, as well as
some other words here mentioned, see below, in
this paragraph, and see what is said of its contr.
مَيْسُورٌ, voce يُسْرٌ,] and ↓ عُسْرَةٌ and ↓ مَعْسَرَةٌ and
↓ مَعْسُرَةٌ and ↓ عُسْرَى [all of which are app.
inf. ns., of 1, q. v.,] (K) Difficulty; hardness;
straitness; intricacy; contr. of يُسْرٌ. (S, A, O,
K.) ―
-b2-  'Eesà Ibn-'Omar observes that every noun
of three letters of which the first is with damm
and the second quiescent is pronounced by some
of the Arabs with the second movent like the
first; as عُسْرٌ and عُسُرٌ, and رُحْمٌ and رُحُمٌ, and حُلْمٌ
and حُلُمٌ. (S, O.) ―
-b3-  It is said in the Kur
[lxv. 7], سَيَجْعَلُ اللّٰهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْرًا [God will give,
after difficulty, ease]. (O, TA.) And again,
[xciv. 5 and 6,] فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا مَعَ الْعُسْرِ
يُسْرًا [And verily with difficulty shall be ease:
verily with difficulty shall be ease]: on reciting
which, Ibn-Mes'ood said, لَنْ يَغْلِبَ عُسْرٌ يُسْرَيْنِ
[A difficulty will not predominate over twofold
ease], which, says Abu-l-'Abbás, is meant as an
explanation of the words of the Kur immediately
preceding it, agreeably with a rule mentioned by
Fr [and applying to most cases, but not to all]:
for العسر being mentioned, and then repeated with
ال, the latter is known to be the same as the
former; and يسرا being mentioned, and repeated
without ال, the latter is known to be different
from the former. (O, * TA.) ―
-b4-  It is also said,
لَوْ دَخَلَ العُسْرُ جُحْرًا لَدَخَلَ اليُسْرُ عَلَيْهِ [If difficulty
were to enter a burrow in the ground, ease would
enter upon it]. (TA.) ―
-b5-  As to ↓ مَعْسُورٌ, it is the
contr. of مَيْسُورٌ, and both are inf. ns.: (S, O:) or
they are put in the places of عُسْرٌ and يُسْرٌ: (TA:)
or accord. to Sb, they both are epithets; for he
holds that there is no inf. n. of the measure
مَفْعُولٌ; and the saying دَعْهُ إِلَى مَيْسُورِهِ وَإِلَى
مَعْسُورِهِ is expl. as signifying Leave thou him to
a thing in which he experiences ease, and to a
thing in which he experiences difficulty: and
مَعْقُولٌ is also expl. in like manner. (S, O.) [In
like manner also,] فُلَانٍ ↓ بَلَغْتُ مَعْسُورَ [may be
expl. as signifying I effected a thing in which such
a one experienced difficulty; meaning I treated
such a one with hardness, harshness, or illnature;
being] said when thou hast not treated the person
of whom thou speakest with gentleness, graciousness, courtesy, or civility. (O, TA.) You also
say, [using معسور and its contr. ميسور as epithets,]
↓ خُذٌ مَيْسُورَهُ وَدَعٌ مَعْسُورَهُ [Take thou what is easy
thereof, and leave thou what is difficult thereof].
(A.) ―
-b6-  عُسْرٌ also signifies Poverty: (Msb:) and
↓ عُسْرَةٌ, [the same: or] littleness of possessions, of
property, of wealth, or of power: (S, TA:) and
↓ مَعْسَرَةٌ and ↓ مَعْسُرَةٌ, [the same: or] difficulty,
and poverty; contr. of مَيْسَرَةٌ: (O, TA:) both
inf. ns.: (O:) and ↓ عُسْرَى, [the same: or] difficult things, affairs, or circumstances; (TA;)
contr. of يُسْرَى: (S, O, TA:) and fem. of أَعْسَرُ,
applied to a thing, or an affair, or a circumstance.
(TA.) ―
-b7-  ↓ جَيْشُ العُسْرَةِ [The army of difficulty]
is an appellation given to the army of Tabook;
because they were summoned to go thither during
the intense heat of summer, (O, K,) and in the
season of the ripening of the fruit, (O, TA,) so
that it was hard to them; (O, K;) and because
the Prophet never warred before with so numerous an army, amounting to thirty thousand. (O,
TA.) ―
-b8-  ↓ فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْعُسْرَى, in the Kur [xcii. 10],

to punishment, and a difficult case. (O, TA.)

S, O, L) and ↓ عَيْسَرَانِيَّةٌ (Lth, Az, TS, O, L) and

is not agreeable with the usage of the Arabs,
(Az, TS, O,) a she-camel that is ridden, (Lth,
Az, S, O, TA,) or laden, (TA,) before she has
been trained: (Lth, Az, S, O, TA:) or that has
been taken in the first stage of her training, while
yet difficult to manage, and had her nose-rein
attached, and been ridden: (K:) and the epithet

(CK,) and ↓ عَيْسَرَانٌ (Lth, Az, and so in some

A she-camel that is wont to raise her tail when
