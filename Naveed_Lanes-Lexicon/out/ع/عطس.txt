عطس1
عَطَسَ, aor.
عَطِسَ (S, A, O, Msb, K) and
عَطُسَ, (S,
O, Msb, K,) the former of which is the more
approved, and therefore it alone is mentioned in

the latter is a simple subst., (TA,) He sneezed;
expl. by أَتَتْهُ العَطْسَةُ: (A, K:) [properly] said
only of a man. (MF, from the “ Iktiráh. ”) It
is said in a trad., كَانَ يُحِبُّ العُطَاسَ وَيَكْرَهُ التَّثَاؤُبَ
[He (Mohammad) used to like sneezing, and dislike yawning]: (O, TA:) because the former is
accompanied by lightness of the body, and openness of the pores, and facilitation of movements;
whereas, in yawning, the contrary is the case;
and these properties are caused by taking light
nourishment and little food and drink: (TA:)
but the Arabs used to augur evil from sneezing;
(A, O;) so that if a man were journeying and
heard a sneeze, it prevented him from going on.

him: (A, O: *) لُجَمٌ and لُجُمٌ are pls. of لُجْمَةٌ
and لِجَامٌ, which are syn. with طِيَرَةٌ, because the
طيرة refrains one from a thing that he wants: for
they used to augur evil from sneezing [as remarked above]: (A:) or he died; (A, O, K;)

worthy of reliance for the meaning assigned by
Lth. (TA.)
