meaning] he wanted, needed, or required, the
thing, [or had it not,] (S, O, K,) and was unable
to attain it: (S, K:) and the thing escaped him,
so that he was unable to attain it, (M, Mgh, Msb,)
it being much wanted by him; (M, TA;) as also
الشَّىْءُ ↓ عَازَهُ: (M, TA:) or the latter, [virtually,

the great men of the Companions differ;] the

إِعْوَزَّ see 1, latter part.

are upon the عنقود [or bunch], (O,) or that are
upon the عنب [or grape-vine], (TA,) with all his
fingers, (O, TA,) so as to clear it of its عوز, (O,)
or so as to clear them from the عُود [or stalk]
thereof. (TA.)
عَوَزٌ inf. n. of عَوِزَ [q. v.] (S, O, Msb.) ―
-b2-
[As a simple subst.,] Want; need; exigency;
(A, O, K;) in which sense مَعَاوِزُ may be an
irreg. pl. thereof similar to مَلَامِحُ and مَشَابِهُ:
(Har p. 26:) destitution: (TA:) poverty: (A:)
evilness of condition: (TA:) littleness, or scarceness, or scantiness, of a thing, to a person, or in
his estimation, and its needfulness to him: (Lth, *
Mgh, TA: *) straitness, or difficulty, of a thing.
(TA.) You say, أَصَابَهُ عَوَزٌ Want, and poverty,
befell him. (A.) And hence the saying, سِدَادٌ
مِنْ عَوَزٍ, (A, Mgh, TA,) a well-known prov.,
expl. in art. سد. (TA.)
عَوِزٌ Poor; needy; indigent: (K, in this art.
and in art. لوز:) and ↓ مُعْوِزٌ signifies the same;
(S, TA;) possessing little; and in an evil condition, as also ↓ مِعْوَزٌ, (O, TA,) which latter is
anomalous. (TA.) You say, إِنَّهُ لَعَوِزٌ لَوِزٌ Verily
he is poor indeed: the last word being an imitative sequent, (K, in this art. and in art. لوز,) and
a corroborative. (TA.)
مُعْوِزٌ: see عَوِزٌ. ―
-b2-  هٰذَا شَىْءٌ مُعْوِزٌ This is a
thing that is rare; scarce; hardly to be found:
(TA:) or not to be found. (A.)
مِعْوَزٌ: see عَوِزٌ.
-A2-  An old and worn-out garment or piece of cloth, that is worn in service and
in labouring; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ مِعْوَزَةٌ: (O, K:)
because such is worn by the poor: (O, K, TA:)
wherefore it has the form of an instrumental
noun: (TA:) and the latter, any garment, or
piece of cloth, with which another is preserved:
or a new garment or piece of cloth, accord. to AZ:
(TA:) but this is [said to be] a mistake ascribed to
AZ: (O:) pl. of the former, مَعَاوِزُ; (S, O, K;
[see also عَوَزٌ;]) and of ↓ the latter, مَعَاوِزَةٌ, with ة
added to corroborate the fem. character. (TA.)
―
-b2-  Also The piece of rag which a woman holds
when wailing for the dead. (TA, voce عَذَبٌ.)
مِعْوَزَةٌ: see مِعْوَزٌ, in two places.
