yields an intense smoke: (TA:) accord. to Lth,
the علنداة is a tall tree, having no thorns, of the
kind termed عِضَاه: but he is incorrect in so saying: it is a tree having hard branches, for which
the cattle, or camels and other beasts, have no
desire, and not of the kind termed عِضَاه; and indeed how can it be of the kind thus termed having
no thorns? nor is it tall, the tallest being of the
height of a man sitting; but, with its shortness, it
is dense and compact in its branches. (Az, TA.)

camel lie down, nor any in which to take a noontide-sleep, but only a direct course to it. (L in
