signifies what a woman makes, of her hair, like a
pomegranate; each lock of which is termed عَقِيصَةٌ;
the pl. being عِقَاصٌ and عَقَائِصُ. (S, O.) [See

also used in the sense of ذَوَائِبُ [or Locks of hair
hanging down loosely from the middle of the head
to the back]. (Mgh. [But this is said in relation
to an instance of its occurrence in which it may
with propriety be regarded as pl. of عَقِيصَةٌ or
عِقْصَةٌ in any of the senses before explained.])
