says, أَعْجَلَنِىفَعَجِلْتُ لَهُ [He incited me, &c., to
haste, &c., and I hasted, &c., to him]. (O, TA.)
And it is said in the Kur [xiii. 7], ↓ وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ
بِالسَّيِّئَةِ قَبْلَ الْحَسَنَةِ [And they incite thee to haste
with that which is evil before that which is good]:
and [in xxii. 46 and xxix. 53,] ↓ وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ

punishment]: (TA:) and بِنَفْسِهِ ↓ استعجل signifies He hastened himself. (MA.) ―
-b2-  اعجلهُ
signifies also [He incited him to haste, &c., by

ye anticipated the command of your Lord?]: (S,

سَبَقَ, wherefore it is made trans. like this latter
verb; (Ksh, Bd;) the phrase meaning أَعَجِلْتُمْ
عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّكُمْ. (Ksh.) وَمَا أَعْجَلَكَ عَنْ قَوْمِكَ, in
the Kur [xx. 85, lit. And what caused thee to

عَنْ حَرْبَتِهِ أَوْ سَوْطِهِ [He saw an animal of the
chase, and he mounted his horse, or mare, and was
incited by haste so as to be prevented from taking
his dart or his whip]: and the saying, هَلَاكُ المَالِ

عُجْلٌ: see عُجَالَةٌ.
عِجْلٌ A calf the young one of the بَقَرَة, (Aboo-Kheyreh, S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) [both domestic
and wild, which latter is a bovine antelope,] from
the time when his mother brings him forth (Aboo-Kheyreh, Mgh, TA) until a month old; (Aboo-Kheyreh, Mgh, Msb, TA;) after which [accord.
to some] he is called بَرْغَزٌ, when about two months
old; and then he is called فَرْقَدٌ: (Aboo-Kheyreh,
TA:) or he is thus called while in the first year,
then تَبِيعٌ, (S and Sgh and K in art. سلغ,) or,
correctly, accord. to IB, he is called while in the
first year عِجْلٌ and تَبِيعٌ, (TA in that art.,) then
جَذَعٌ, then ثَنِىٌّ, then رَبَاعٍ, then سَدِيسٌ, then سَالِغُ
سَنَةٍ and سَالِغُ سَنَتَيْنِ and so on: (S and Sgh and
K ibid.:) the fem. is with ة: (Abu-l-Jarráh,
S, O, Msb:) pl. of the masc. عِجَلَةٌ (Mgh, Msb)
and عُجُولٌ (Msb, TA) and, of pauc., أَعْجِلَةٌ and
أَعْجَالٌ; (IB, TA;) [and of the fem. عِجَلٌ;] but
as to عِجَالٌ as a pl., [Mtr says,] I have not heard
it: (Mgh:) and ↓ عِجَّوْلٌ signifies the same as
عِجْلٌ; (S, Mgh, O, K;) fem. with ة; (TA;)
and pl. عَجَاجِيلُ. (S, Mgh, O, K.)
عَجَلٌ and ↓ عَجَلَةٌ, both inf. ns. of عَجِلَ [q. v.],
(Mgh, Msb,) are Syn. with سُرْعَةٌ; (K;) contr. of
بُطْءٌ: (S, O:) the latter is expl. by Th as signifying the seeking, and pursuing, or endeavouring
after, a thing before its proper time, or season;
and as proceeding from the desire of the soul;
wherefore it is generally discommended in the
Kur-án, so that it is said to be from the Devil.
(TA.) It is said in the Kur [xxi. 38], خُلِقَ
الْإِنْسَانُ مِنْ عَجَلٍ, meaning, it is said, Man is
composed of haste; (O;) so says Fr, and in like
manner says Aboo-Is-hák; (T, TA;) to denote
the excess of this attribute in him: (T, O, TA:)
or, accord. to Th, (TA,) the phrase is inverted,
the meaning being, haste is created from man;
(Msb, TA;) but IJ disapproves this explanation,
and also another which will be mentioned in what
follows. (TA.)
-A2-  عَجَلٌ signifies also Food that
is hastily prepared, and brought, before the [meal
called] غَدَآء has become matured. (TA.) [See
also عُجَّالٌ.]
-A3-  Also Clay, or earth; syn. طِينٌ:
(IAar, O, K:) or black mud, or black fetid mud;
syn. حَمْأَةٌ: and ↓ عَجَلَةٌ has both of these meanings, i. e. طِينٌ and حَمْأَةٌ: (O, * K:) the former
of these two significations of عَجَلٌ is said by AO
to be of the dial. of Himyer; and IAar says that
it is what is meant in the phrase in the Kur
[xxi. 38] cited above; but Ibn-'Arafeh disapproves
this; (O, TA;) and so does Az; and Er-Rághib
says that some expl. it as meaning in this instance
stinking black mud, but that their saying is nought.
(TA.)
-A4-  See also عَجَلَةٌ, in four places.
عَجُلٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.

↓ عَجِيلٌ (K) and ↓ عَجْلَانُ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K)
Hasting, hastening, making haste, or speeding;
[thus more properly the first and second, and
often the last; the rest generally signifying]
hasty, speedy, quick, or expeditious: (S, Mgh, O,
Msb, * K:) pls., (K, TA,) all of ↓ عَجْلَانُ, (TA,)
عَجَالَى and عُجَالَى and عِجَالٌ; (K, TA;) the
first and last of which pls., as pls. of عَجْلَى [fem.
of عَجْلَانُ], are applied to women (S, O, TA)
also: (TA:) عَجِلٌ has no broken pl., nor has
↓ عَجُلٌ: (Sb, TA:) ISk says that, for the dim.
of عَجِلٌ, they use ↓ عُجَيْلَانُ, as formed from
عَجْلَانُ; though they also form it regularly,
saying ↓ عُجَيْلٌ; but the former is the better.
(O, TA.)
عُجْلَةٌ: see عُجَالَةٌ.
عِجْلَةٌ fem. of عِجْلٌ [q. v.]. (Abu-l-Jarráh,
S, O, Msb.)

-A3-  And
A species of plant, (S, O, K, TA,) which extends
along the ground, (TA,) also called وَشِيجٌ [q. v.]:
(O, TA:) AHn says of the وشيج, on the authority of Aboo-Ziyád, it grows, at first, from one
root, then branches forth upon the surface of the
earth, in innumerable branches, every branch
having a knot, or joint, (كَعْبٌ,) from which
knot, or joint, grow other branches; it cleaves
to the ground, not rising high; its leaves are like
those of wheat; and while green, it is called
عِجْلَة; (O;) and it is the best of pasture, and
is not [what is termed] a بَقْل: (O, TA:) and it
is said to be a tree having leaves and joints, or
knots, (كُعُوب,) and pliant canes, [for قضب in
my original, I read قَصَب, (see وَشِيجٌ,)] long,
or elongated, with a fruit like the foot of the
domestic fowl, contracted, which, when it dries
up, opens; and not having any blossom. (TA.)
