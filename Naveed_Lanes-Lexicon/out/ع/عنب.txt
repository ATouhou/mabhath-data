عنب2
عنّب, (O, K,) inf. n. تَعْنِيبٌ, (K,) said of a
grape-vine, [meaning It produced grapes,] (O,
K,) is from العِنَبُ. (O.)
عِنَبٌ and ↓ عِنَبَآء both signify the same, (S, O,
K,) the latter said by Kr to be the only word of
its measure except سِيَرَآء, but Kh mentions also
حِوَلَآء, and Ibn-Kuteybeh adds to these خِيَلَآء,
(TA,) [whence it seems to be, accord. to analogy,
عِنَبَآءُ, imperfectly decl., with the fem. ء, but in a
verse cited by F, and quoted in the O and TA, it is
treated as masc., and in the TA it is treated as
masc. in prose, and if so it is عِنَبَآءٌ, though it may
be thus only by poetic license, and improperly in
prose,] Grapes, the fruit of the كَرْم; (TA;) thus
called only while fresh; when dry, called زَبِيب:
(Msb:) عِنَبَةٌ signifies a single berry thereof [i. e.
a grape]; (S, O, Msb, K; *) and is of a form
generally belonging to a pl., rarely to a sing.:
(S, O:) the pl. is أَعْنَابٌ, (S, O, Msb,) used in
speaking of many; and the pl. of pauc. [i. e. pl.
of عِنَبَةٌ] is عِنَبَاتٌ. (S, O.) ―
-b2-  عِنَبٌ also signifies
(assumed tropical:)  The grape-vine. (MF [as from the K, in which
I do not find it: but it is used in this sense in the
Kur-án; pl. أَعْنَابٌ, expl. as meaning كُرُوم in
xviii. 31 by Bd].) ―
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  Wine: (K:) so
