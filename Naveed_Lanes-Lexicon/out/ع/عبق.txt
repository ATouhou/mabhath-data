(O, K,) The perfume clung to him, or it, (S,
Mgh, O, K, TA,) and remained; and so عَسِقَ به;
(TA;) and the odour of the perfume clung to him,
or it: (Mgh:) or the odour of the perfume was,
or became, perceptible in his garment or his
person: and it is said to relate only to fragrant
odour. (Msb.) ―

of a garment, عَبِقَ بِالجِسْمِ [It clung to the body].
(TA.) And عَبِقَ الشَّىْءُ بِغَيْرِهِ The thing clave, or
kept, to another. (Msb.) And عَبِقَ الشَّىْءُ بِقَلْبِى

التَّعْبِيقُ signifies التَّذْكِيَةُ [used in relation to
wine, app. as meaning The becoming old; though
the latter word, thus used, is probably tropical].
(O, K.) 'Adee Ibn-Zeyd says, describing wine,
صَانَهَا التَّاجِرُ اليَهُودِىُّ حَوْلَيْ
نِ فَأَذْكَى مِنْ نَشْرِهَا التَّعْبِيقُ
[which seems to be cited as meaning, The Jewish
merchant kept it two years, and the becoming old
enhanced its fragrance: but I think that the last
word may be more properly rendered the making
it to remain long in its jar]. (O.)
Q. Q. 3
اِعْبَنْقَى He (a man, S) became cunning, or very cunning: (صَارَ دَاهِيَةً: S, O, K:) or
became evil in disposition: (K:) and in like
manner signifies اِبْعَنْقَى. (TA.)
عَبَقٌ: see what next follows.
عَبِقٌ Perfume [clinging to a person or thing,
and remaining; and of which the odour clings:
(see 1, first sentence:) or] of which the odour is
perceptible in the garment or person: (Msb:) it
is applied as an epithet to an odour; and ↓ عَبَقٌ
also, as the inf. n., meaning ذُو عَبَقٍ. (Ham p.
710.) ―
-b2-  Applied to a man, Such that, when he
has perfumed himself with the least perfume, it
does not leave him for days: and in like manner
with ة applied to a woman. (Lth, O, K.) ―
-b3-
عَبِقَةٌ لَبِقَةٌ, applied to a woman, means Whom
every dress and perfume suits. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And the
Khuzá'ees, who were the most chaste speakers of
Arabic, said رَجُلٌ عَبِقٌ لَبِقٌ as meaning ظَرِيفٌ
[i. e. A man excellent, or elegant, in mind, manners, and address or speech; and in person, countenance, or garb: &c.]. (TA.)
عَبَقَةٌ Feculence (وَضَرٌ) of clarified butter,
[adhering to the interior] in a skin; (IDrd, S, O,
K;) also termed عَبَكَةٌ; (IDrd, O, TA;) and
عَمَقَةٌ, in which the م is asserted by Lh to be a
substitute for ب. (TA.) And one says, مَا فِى
النِّحْىِ عَبَقَةٌ, meaning There is not aught [remaining] of clarified butter in the skin; (S, O;) as
also عَبَكَةٌ. (S and O in art. عبك.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
one says also, مَا بَقِيتْ لَهُمْ عَبَقَةٌ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [There remained not to them] any relic [of
their possessions]. (TA.)
عِبِقَّانٌ رِبِقَّانٌ, [in the CK, erroneously, عَبْقانُ
رَبْقانُ,] and with ة [affixed to each], applied to a
man, Evil in disposition: and with ة applied to a
female: so in the K; but this is inconsistent
with what here follows: (TA:) accord. to As,
عِبِقَّانٌ رِبِقَّانٌ and عِبِقَّانَةٌ رِبِقَّانَةٌ are applied to a
man, meaning as above; and to the woman in
like manner. (O, TA.)
رَجُلٌ عَبَاقَآءُ A man who sticks to another.
(O, K.)
عَبَاقِيَةٌ, applied to a man, (S, O, K,) Guileful,
or crafty; (K;) cunning, or very cunning; (S,
O, K;) evil, or mischievous. (O.) ―
-b2-  And A
thief, (O, K,) who steals camels, (خَارِبٌ, K,) or
who strips people forcibly of their clothes, (حَارِبٌ,
O,) who will not refrain from anything: thus
expl. by Ish. (O.)
-A2-  Also A scar caused by a
wound in the ball, or most elevated part, of the
cheek. (S, O, K.) So in the saying, بِهِ شَيْنٌ
عَبَاقِيَةٌ [In him is a blemish, a scar &c.], (S,) or
شَيْنٌ وَعَبَاقِيَةٌ [a blemish and a scar &c.]. (O.)
-A3-  And A certain thorny tree, (O, K, TA,) that
hurts (O, TA) him who is caught by its thorns;
said by AHn to be of the [kind called] عِضَاه.
(TA.)
عُقَابٌ عَبَنْقَاةٌ (S, O, K) and عَبَنْقَآءُ (K) and
عَقَنْبَاةٌ, (S, O,) like قَعْنَبَاةٌ, (O, K,) An eagle
having sharp talons: (S, O:) or, accord. to
IDrd, hard and strong [in the talons]. (O.)
