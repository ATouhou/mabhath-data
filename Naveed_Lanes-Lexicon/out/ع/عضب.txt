inf. n. عَضْبٌ, (S, A, O, &c.,) He cut, or cut off,
him, or it. (S, A, * Mgh, * O, Msb, K.) مَا لَهُ
عَضَبَهُ اللّٰهُ, meaning [What aileth him?] may
God cut off (O, TA) his arm and his leg, or his
hand and his foot, (O,) or his arms and his legs,
or his hands and his feet, is a form of imprecation
used by the Arabs. (TA.) And hence, (O,) one
says, إِنَّ الحَاجَةَ لَيَعْضِبُهَا طَلَبُهَا قَبْلَ وَقْتِهَا (assumed tropical:)  Verily
the seeking of the object of want before its time
assuredly cuts it off, or precludes it, and mars it:
a prov. (O, TA.) And إِنَّكَ لَتَعْضِبُنِى عَنْ حَاجَتِى
(assumed tropical:)  Verily thou cuttest me off from [the attainment
of] the object of my want. (TA.) ―

with a spear. (TK.) [But in the O and TA,
عَضَبْتُهُ بِالرُّمْحِ is expl. by the words هُوَ أَنْ تَشْغَلَهُ
عَنْهُ; and the meaning app. is, I occupied him so
as to divert him with the spear; though this
meaning would be expressed more agreeably with
usage by saying هو ان يشغله عنه; or rather هو
ان تَشْغَلَهُ عَنْكَ, which, I think, is the right reading.] ―
-b5-  And It (disease, O) rendered him weak,
or infirm: (S, O:) and (O) deprived him of the

(TA,) meaning [Disease of long continuance, or
want of some one or more of the limbs,] deprived
him of the power of motion: and AHeyth says,
it [in the O هُوَ (so that it does not refer to الزمانة),
and in the TA العضب,] is الشَّلَلُ and الخَبْلُ and
العَرَجُ [a state of privation of the power of motion,

that these are the effects denoted by the phrase
