vehement coming; for it seems that الرَّجُلَ is
meant, and that عَرْيَة and عَرْوَة are inf. ns. of

that the verb mostly used is the former, and its

عُرْوَةٌ primarily signifies A thing by means of
which another thing is rendered fast, or firm, and

metaphorically applied in this sense; from the
same word as signifying an appertenance of a

with kesr; but correctly with damm and with
the ر quiescent [i. e. ↓ عُرْوٌ] as in the Tekmileh;
and also with kesr [i. e. ↓ عِرْوٌ]; as though these
two were pls. [or rather coll. gen. ns.] of عروة
[i. e. عُرْوَةٌ and عِرْوَةٌ]: (TA:) the pl. is عُرًى:
(Msb:) عراوى [i. e. عَرَاوَى] as pl. of عُرْوَةٌ is
vulgar. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [The pl.] عُرًى also signifies
[in like manner] Certain [well-known] appertenances [i. e. loop] of loads, or burdens, and of the

of loads shall not be made fast for the purpose of
journeying save to three mosques; that of Mekkeh,

called] حَمْض that are depastured in the case of
drought: (K:) or especially a collection of عِضَاه
upon which men pasture [their beasts or cattle]
when they experience drought: or such as remain
of عِضَاه and of حَمْض and are depastured in the
case of drought; and it is not applied to any trees
but these, unless to any trees that have remained
in the صَيْف [here app. meaning spring, having
survived the winter]: (TA:) also tangled, or
luxuriant, or abundant and dense, trees, among
which the camels pass the winter, and whereof
they eat: (K:) and (as some say, TA) tree of

حَمْض; so that when, men experience drought, the
cattle gain the means of subsistence; thus accord.
to Az: or pasture that remains after the [other]
herbage has dried up; because the cattle cling
thereto, or eat thereof in the winter. (تَتَعَلَّقُ بِهَا,)
and are preserved thereby: wherefore they are
also called عُلْقَة: (Mgh: [but for عَلَقة in my
copy of that work, I have substituted عُلْقَة as
being evidently the right word:]) [see also عُقْدَةٌ,
in the last quarter of the paragraph, in two
places:] the pl. is عُرًى. (S, TA.) ―
-b7-  Also The
environs of a town [where people pasture their
cattle]. (K, TA.) One says, رَعَيْنَا عُرْوَةَ مَكَّةَ i. e.

“ There is no deity but God: ” from العُرْوَةُ [in
the first of the senses assigned to it above, as is
indicated in the Msb in relation to a similar
phrase here following; or] as signifying “ the
trees that have a lower portion remaining in the
earth, as the نَصِىّ and the عَرْفَج &c.; ” as expl.
above. (TA.) And أَوْثَقُ عُرًى [The firmest of

عَرِىٌّ an epithet applied to a palm-tree such as
is termed عَرِيَّةٌ [q. v.]: one says نَخْلَةٌ عَرِىٌّ, (S,
Msb,) the latter word without ة; like as one
says اِمْرَأَةٌ قَتِيلٌ. (Msb.)
-A2-  And رِيحٌ عَرِيَّةٌ (S,
K) and عَرِىٌّ (K) A cold wind. (S, K: mentioned
in the K in this art. and also in art. عرى) And
one says also, إِنَّ عَشِيَّتَنَا هٰذِهِ لَعَرِيَّةٌ [Verily this

need, (S, Mgh,) for him to eat its fruit (S, Mgh,
Msb, K *) during a year: (S, Mgh, K:) and of
which what was upon it has been eaten: (K:) so
some say: or that does not retain its fruit, this
becoming scattered from it: (TA:) and one that
has been excluded from the bargaining on the
occasion of the selling of palm-trees: (K:) so
some say: (TA:) the pl. is عَرَايَا: (S, Mgh,
Msb:) it is said that on the occasion of the
prohibition of المُزَابَنَة, which is the selling of the
fruit upon the heads of palm-trees for dried dates,
license was conceded in respect of the عَرَايَا, because a needy man, attaining to the season of
fresh ripe dates, and having no money with
which to buy them for his household, nor any
palm-trees to feed them therefrom, but having
some dried dates remaining of his food, would
come to the owner of palm-trees, and say to him,
“ Sell to me the fruit of a palm-tree,” or “ of two
palm-trees,” and would give him those remaining
dried dates for that fruit: therefore license was
conceded in respect of that fruit when less than
five أَوْسُق [pl. of pauc. of وَسْقٌ, q. v.]: (Nh, TA:
[and the like is said, but much less fully, in the
Mgh; and somewhat thereof in the S:]) the
word is of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ in the sense of the
measure مَفْعُولَةٌ, because the person to whom it is
assigned repairs to it (S, Nh, * Mgh, Msb, TA)
to gather its fruit: (Mgh:) or the tree is so
called because it is freed from prohibition, (Nh,
Mgh, TA,) from عَرِىَ, aor. يَعْرَى, (Nh, TA,) in
which case the word is of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ in
the sense of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ; or because it is
as though it were divested of its fruit: (Mgh:)
the ة is affixed because the word is reckoned
among substs., like نَطِيحَةٌ and أَكِيلَةٌ. (S, Msb.)
[It is mentioned in the K in art. عرى. See also
عَرِىٌّ, above.] ―
-b2-  Also A مِكْتَل [or kind of basket,

المَكِيلِ is erroneously put for المِكْتَلُ.])
[
عَرَاوَةٌ, expl. by Freytag as signifying “ oleris
species ” &c., is a manifest mistake for عَرَارَةٌ, n. un.
of عَرَارٌ, q. v.]
عَارٍ act. part. n. of عَرَاهُ in the first [and in others
also] of the senses assigned to it above. (Msb.)
