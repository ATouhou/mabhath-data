عدس1
عَدَسَ فِى الأَرْضِ, (AA, S, O, K,) aor.
عَدِسَ,
inf. n. عَدْسٌ (AA, O, K) and عَدَسَانٌ and عِدَاسٌ
(Ibn-'Abbád, O, K) and عُدُوسٌ, (O, K,) He went
away [or journeyed] into, or in, or through, the
country, or land. (AA, S, O, K.) One says,
عَدَسَتْ بِهِ المَنِيَّةُ (S, O) i. e. [Death] took him
away. (O.) And El-Kumeyt says,
أُكَلِّفُهَا هَوْلَ الظَّلَامِ وَلَمْ أَزَلْ
↓ إِلَىَّ وَعَادِسَا ↓ أَخَا اللَّيْلِ مَعْدُوسًا
or عَلَىَّ, as some relate it, (O, [and thus, instead
of إِلَىَّ, in one of my copies of the S,]) meaning
[I constrain them (referring to camels mentioned
in a preceding verse) to bear the terror of the
darkness, and I cease not to be, as a nightfarer,]
journeyed to by night [and journeying]. (S, O.)
[It is added in the S, as though to indicate
another meaning, وَعَدَسَ لُغَةٌ فِى حَدَسَ; and in
the O and K, وَالعَدْسُ الحَدْسُ; (in the O with
أَيْضًا between these two inf. ns.;) but accord. to
the TA, the meaning intended by this is, The
going away into, or in, the country, or land: see,
however, what here follows.] ―
-b2-  العَدْسُ also signifies The treading hard, or vehemently, (شِدَّةُ
الوَطْءِ, S, O, K, TA,) upon the ground; and so
الحَدْسُ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And i. q. الكَدْحُ [app. as
meaning The working, or labouring; or toiling,
or labouring hard]; (S, O, K, TA;) as also
الحَدْسُ. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And, accord. to IKtt, عَدَسَ,
said of a man, signifies قَوِىَ عَلَى الشَّرِّ [He was
strong to do evil, or mischief: but I think it probable that the right explanation is, على السَّيْرِ or
على السُّرَى, i. e. to journey, or to journey by
night: see عَدُوسٌ]. (TA.)
-A2-  عَدَسَ, aor.
عَدِسَ,
(AA, O, K,) inf. n. عَدْسٌ, (TA,) also signifies
He served [another]; syn. خَدَمَ. (AA, O, K.)
―
-b2-  And عَدَسَ المَالَ, inf. n. عَدْسٌ, He pastured
the cattle, or camels &c. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K,
TA.) And هُوَ يَعْدِسُ عَلَيْهِ He pastures for him.
(Ibn-'Abbád, O.)
-A3-  عَدَسَ بِهِ, (O, K,) and عَدَسَهُ,
(IKtt, * O,) He said to him (i. e. to a mule, O)
عَدَسْ [q. v.]. (IKtt, O, K.)
-A4-  عُدِسَ, He had
an eruption of the small pustule called عَدَسَة
[q. v.]. (K, * O, * TA.)
3
عادس He journeyed continually. (Freytag,
from the Deewán of Jereer.)]
عَدَسْ A cry by which one chides a mule, (IDrd,
S, IKtt, * O, K,) to urge him: (IKtt:) sometimes, by poetic license, it is made decl.: (L,
TA:) the vulgar say عد [app. عَدْ]. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Hence, (TA,) sometimes, (S, O,) it is also used
as a name for The mule; (S, O, K;) like as the
ass is [sometimes] called سَأْ سَأْ, which is [origiginally] a cry whereby one chides an ass; and
there are other instances of the same kind. (TA.)
عَدَسٌ [Lentils;] a well-known grain; (S, O,
K;) also called عَلَسٌ and بُلُسٌ: (TA:) n. un.
with ة. (O, K.) ―
-b2-  عَدَسُ المَآءِ A certain plant
[of which I have not found any description].
(See art. ساذج, last sentence.)
عَدَسَةٌ A small pustule, (Lth, S, * O, * K,) resembling the عَدَسة [commonly so called, i. e. the
single grain of lentil], (Lth, TA,) which comes
forth (Lth, O, K) in the body (Lth, K) in a man,
(S, O,) dispersedly, like the طَاعُون [or plague],
(Lth, TA,) of which it is said to be a kind, (Lth,
O, TA,) and kills, (Lth, O, K,) or sometimes
kills, (S,) or generally kills, (Lth, TA,) few recovering from it: (Lth, O:) it was feared by the
tribe of Kureysh, as being transitive. (O.)
[
عَدَسِيَّةٌ A soup made by boiling yellow lentils in
water, till nearly dissolved, and then adding red
vinegar, coriander, and salt. (Ibn-Jezleh, quoted,
from Channing, by Greenhill, in his Transl. of
Er-Rázee on Small-pox and Measles.)
-A2-  It is
now applied also to Bats' dung; which is used
in medicine, administered internally; and also
applied externally, mixed with vinegar, to tumours: so says Forskål in his Descr. Animalium,
p. iii.: but he there states عدسيه to be an appel-lation of the bat itself.]
عَدُوسٌ, applied to a female, [and app. to a
male also,] Bold, or daring; (Ibn-'Abbád, O,
K, TA;) strong to journey. (TA.) And عَدُوسُ
السُّرَى Strong to journey (S, O, K) by night; as
a masc. epithet; (O, K;) and as a fem. epithet
applied to the hyena: (S, O:) or عَدُوسُ اللَّيْلِ,
as meaning strong to journey by night, is applied
to a man and to a woman and to a camel.
