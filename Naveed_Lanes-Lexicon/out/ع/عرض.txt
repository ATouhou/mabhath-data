عرض1
عَرُضَ, aor.
عَرُضَ, inf. n. عِرَضٌ, [instead of which,
as a simple subst., عَرْضٌ is generally used,] and
عَرَاضَةٌ, It was, or became, broad, or wide; (S, O, *
Msb, K, TA;) as also ↓ اعرض, (A, TA,) which
occurs in this sense in two exs. following. (TA.)
[And in like manner, ↓ استعرض It grew, or spread,
wide; said of a tree; opposed to طَالَ; occurring
in the TA in art. بهل.] It is said in a prov.,
القِرْفَةُ ↓ أَعْرَضَتِ (S, O, * TA [but in two copies of
the S, I find the verb in this instance written
اعرضتُ, and in the O اعرضتَ, and I do not know
that the reading in the TA, which seems to be the
common one, is found in any copy of the S,])
Suspicion became, or has become, wide; syn.
اِتَّسَعَت: (TA:) used when it is said to a man,
“ Whom dost thou suspect ? ” and he answers,
“ The sons of such a one,” referring to the whole
tribe. (S, O, TA.) [See Freytag's Arab. Prov.
ii. 112, where another reading is mentioned,
which, by what he says, is shown to be أَعْرَضْتَ
القِرْفَةَ Thou hast made suspicion wide.] In another prov. it is said, ثَوْبُ المَلْبَسِ ↓ أَعْرَضَ (IAar,
A, TA, and K in art. لبس,) and المِلْبَسِ and
المُلْبِسِ (IAar, and K in art. لبس,) and المُلْتَبِسِ
(TA in art. لبس) i. e. صَارَ ذَا عَرْضٍ, (A, TA,) and
عَرُضَ, and اِتَّسَعَ; (Sh;) [meaning the same as
the prov. before mentioned;] used with reference
to him whose suspicion has become wide; (IAar,
and TA in art. لبس;) i. e. with reference to him
who suspects many persons (IAar, Az, and K in
art. لبس,) of a theft; (IAar, Az, and TA in that
art.;) or of saying a thing: (TS, and TA in
that art.:) or when thou askest a person respecting a thing and he does not explain it to thee.
(TA in that art.) [See, again, Freytag's Arab.
Prov. ii. 100, where it is said that أَعْرَضَ ثَوْبُ
المُلْبِسِ app. means The garment of the suspected
appeared, or has appeared: but that another
reading is عَرُضَ, meaning became, or has become,
wide.]
-A2-  عَرَضَ, aor.
عَرِضَ, (Fr, S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n.
عَرْضٌ; (TA:) and عَرِضَ, (As, TS, K,) aor.
عَرَضَ,
(Fr, K,) or
عَرِضَ, like حَسِبَ, aor.
عَرِضَ, deviating from
the general rule; (As, TS;) It (a thing) appeared,
or became apparent, لَهُ to him; (S, O, Msb, K;
[but in some copies of the K, instead of the explanation ظَهَرَ وَبَدَا, we find ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ وَبَدَا, which
is a mistake;]) as also ↓ اعرض, (Fr, S, O, Msb,
K,) which is a deviation from a general rule,
being quasi pass. of عَرَضَهُ, which see below; (S, *
O, * Msb, K;) [lit.] it showed its breadth, or
width. (O, * TA.) You say, لَكَ الشَّىْءُ ↓ اعرض
مِنْ بَعِيدٍ The thing appeared to thee from afar.
(TA.) And عَرَضَتْ لَهُ الغُولُ, and عَرِضَتْ, (AZ,
S, O, K,) The ghool appeared to him. (K.) The
Arabs say, of a thing, عَرَضَ and ↓ اعرض and
↓ تعرّض and ↓ اعترض, using these verbs as syn.;
(Sh;) [app. as meaning It showed, presented, or
offered, itself, (lit. its breadth, or width, or its
side, see 5,) to a person: the first and last also
often signify, and the others sometimes, he obtruded himself in an affair; interfered therein:]
IKt disallows ↓ اعرض in the sense of اعترض, as
not having been found by him: (TA:) [but] an
instance of the former of these two verbs used in
the sense of the latter of them occurs in the phrase
لِلنَّاظِرِينَ ↓ إِذَا أُعْرَضَتْ [app. meaning When she
shows, or presents, herself to the lookers], in a
poem by one of the tribe of Teiyi. (Sh.) ―
-b2-
عَرَضَ لَكَ الخَيْرُ, [in one place in the TA الخَبَرَ,
and الخبر in a copy of the Msb,] inf. n. عَرْضٌ;
(TA; [in one place in the TA عُرُوضٌ there referring to الخَبَرُ, which is app. a mistranscription;])
and ↓ اعرض; (S, O, K, TA;) Good [i. e. the
doing of good] hath become within thy power, or
practicable to thee, or easy to thee. (S, O, K,
TA.) And لَكَ الظَّبْىُ ↓ اعرض The gazelle hath
exposed to thee its side; (TA;) or hath put its
side in thy power, (S, O, K, TA,) by turning it
towards thee: (O, TA:) said to incite one to
shoot it, or cast at it. (S, O.) Or لَكَ ↓ اعرض,
said of an animal of the chase, or other thing,
signifies It hath put in thy power, [or exposed to
thee,] its breadth, or width: (A:) or لَهُ ↓ اعرض
signifies it (a thing) became within his power, or
practicable to him, or easy to him; lit., it showed
its side [to him]. (Mgh.) [In the TA, I find
أَعْرَضَ فِى الشَّىْءِ expl. as signifying He had the
width of the thing in his power: but فى, here,
seems to be a mistake for لَهُ.] A poet, also, says
↓ أَعْرِضِى addressing a woman; meaning أَمْكِنِى
[Empower thou; i. e. grant thou access]. (S.)
―
-b3-  عَرَضَ لَهُ, aor.
عَرِضَ; (As, S, K, TA;) and عَرِضَ,
aor.
عَرَضَ; (TA;) are also said of an event, (As, TA,)
or of a disease, and the like, (S, K, TA,) such as
disquietude of mind, and a state of distraction of
the mind or attention; (TA;) [meaning It happened to him; it befell him; it occurred to him;
was incident to him;] and also of doubt, and the
like. (TA.) [So, too, is ↓ اعترض.] You also say,
عَرَضَهُ عَارِضٌ مِنَ الحُمَّى وَنَحْوِهَا [An occurrence
of fever, and the like, happened to him, or befell
him]. (S.) And البَدَنَ ↓ اعترض [It befell the
body] is said of [a disease, as, for instance,] the
mange, or scab. (B, in TA in art. عر.) ―
-b4-  عَرَضَ
لَهُ, aor.
عَرِضَ; (Msb, TA;) and عَرِضَ له, aor,
عَرَضَ; (Msb;)
He intervened as an obstacle to him, preventing
him from attaining his desire, (Msb, TA, *) or
from seeking to attain his desire, and from going
his way; (TA;) as also له ↓ اعترض. (Msb.) You
say also, عَرَضَ لَهُ أَشَدَّ العَرْضِ, and ↓ اعترض, He
opposed himself to him (قَابَلَهُ بِنَفْسِهِ) with the most
vehement opposition of himself. (TA.) See also 5,
second sentence. One should not say, عرّضتُ لَهُ,
with teshdeed, in the sense of اِعْتَرَضْتُ. (Msb.)
You also say, عَرَضَ عَارِضٌ, meaning [An obstacle

And سِرْتُ فَعَرَضَ لِى فِى الطَّرِيقِ عَارِضٌ مِنْ جَبَلٍ
وَنَحْوِهِ I journeyed, and there opposed itself to me,
so as to prevent my going on, an obstacle consisting in a mountain, and the like; as also ↓ اعترض:

upon the evidence. (Msb.) And عَرَضَ لَهُ الشَّىْءُ
فِى الطَّرِيقِ The thing intervened as an obstacle to
him in the way, preventing him from going on.
(TA.) And عَرَضَ الشَّىْءُ The thing stood up and

اعترض, q. v.] And الشَّىْءُ دُونَ الشَّىْءِ ↓ اعترض
The thing intervened as an obstacle in the way to
the thing; syn. حَالَ. (S, O.) ―

he means [And convey thou to Yezeed,] if thou

thou go to him: or if thou present thyself to him.]

عَرِضَ, inf. n. عَرْضٌ,
(L, TA,) The horse went along inclining towards
one side: (K, TA:) or ran inclining his breast
and head: (L, TA:) and ran inclining his head
and neck; (K; [in which only the inf. n. of the
verb in this last sense is mentioned;]) the doing
of which is approved in horses, but disapproved
in camels. (TA.) [See also 3, and 5.] ―
-b9-  عَرَضَ
البَعِيرُ, (K,) inf. n. عَرْضٌ, (TA,) The camel ate of
the أَعْرَاض, i. e. of the upper parts of the trees [or
shrubs]. (K.) ―
-b10-  عَرَضَتْ, said of a she-camel, A
fracture, (S, O, K,) or some injurious accident,
(S, O,) befell her; (S, O, K;) as also عَرِضَتْ;
(O, K;) but the former is the more approved:
(TA:) and عَرَضَ لَهَا a disease, or a fracture,
befell her. (TA, from a trad.) Also, said of a
sheep, or goat, (شاة,) It died by disease. (K.) And
عَرِضَ الشَّآءُ The sheep, or goats, burst, or became
rent, from abundance of herbage. (K.) And
عَرَضَ, (IKtt,) inf. n. عَرْضٌ, (K,) He (an animal,

-b11-  عَرَضَ بِسِلْعَتِهِ i. q.
عَارَضَ بِهَا. (K.) See 3, in two places. [And

He (a man, S, O) came to العَرُوض, i. e. Mekkeh
and El-Medeeneh, (S, O, K, TA,) and El-Yemen,
(TA,) and what is around them. (S, O, K, TA.)
-A3-  عَرَضَ الشَّىْءَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.
عَرِضَ, inf. n. عَرْضٌ,
(Msb,) He made the thing apparent; showed it;
exhibited it; manifested it; exposed it to view;
presented it; (S, O, Msb, K;) unfolded it; laid
it open: and also he mentioned it: (Msb:)
[lit. he showed its breadth, or width, or its side:
and hence it also signifies he made the thing to
stand as an obstacle, دُونَ شَىْءٍ in the way to, or
of, a thing.] You say, عَرَضَ لَهُ الشَّىْءَ He made
apparent, showed, exhibited, manifested, or exposed
to view, to him the thing; (S, O, K;) unfolded it,
or laid it open, to him. (S, TA.) And عَرَضَ
عَلَيْهِ أَمْرَ كَذَا (S, O, K *) He showed, propounded,
or proposed, to him, such a thing, or such a case:
(K, * TA:) [and he asked, or required, of him,
with gentleness, the doing of such a thing; for]
العَرْضُ signifies طَلَبٌ بِلِينٍ, (Mughnee and K,
voce أَلَا,) or طَلَبٌ بِلِينٍ وَتَأَدُّبٍ. (Mughnee voce
لَوْلَا.) And عَرَضْتُ المَتَاعَ لِلْبَيْعِ [I showed, exposed,
presented, or offered, the commodity for sale; or]
I showed the commodity to those desirous of purchasing it. (Msb.) The phrase عَرَضَ عَلَيْهِ المَتَاعَ
[He showed, or offered, to him the commodity] is
used because the person shows to the other the
length and breadth of the thing (طُولَهُ وَعَرْضَهُ),
or because he shows him one of its sides (عُرْضًا
مِنْ أَعْرَاضِهِ). (Mgh.) [Hence,] it is said in a
trad. of Hodheyfeh, تُعْرَضُ الفِتَنُ عَلَى القُلُوبِ
عَرْضَ الحَصِيرِ, which means, accord. to some, that
فِتَن [Temptations, &c.,] will be [displayed and]
embellished to the hearts of men like [as] the
ornamented and variegated garment called حصير
[is displayed and embellished]: (B, TA in art.
حصر:) or the meaning is, that they will be laid
and spread upon the hearts like the حصير: (IAth,
TA in the present art.:) and some say that by
this last word is here meant a certain vein extending across upon the side of a beast, towards
the belly. (TA in art. حصر.) [Hence also,] عَرْضٌ
سَابِرِىٌّ [A slight exhibition: (see art. سبر:)] so in
the proverbs by A'Obeyd, in the handwriting of
Ibn-El-Jawáleekee: (TA:) or عَرْضُ سَابِرِىٍّ: (TA,
and so in a copy of the S in this art.:) or عَرْضَ
سَابِرِىٍّ. (O, TA, and so in a copy of the S in this
art.) With this agrees in meaning the saying
عَرَضَ عَلَىَّ سَوْمَ عَالَّةٍ [He offered to me in the
manner of offering water to camels taking a
second draught: see also arts. سوم and عل; and
see Freytag's Arab. Prov. ii. 84]. (TA.) You
say also, عَرَضْتُ الجَارِيَةَ عَلَى البَيْعِ [I showed, or
displayed, or exposed, or offered, the girl for
sale]: (S, O, TA:) and in like manner المَتَاعَ
[the commodity]. (TA.) And عَرَضْتُ لَهُ ثَوْبًا
مَكَانَ حَقِّهِ; (S, O;) and عَرَضْتُ لَهُ مِنْ حَقِّهِ ثَوْبًا,
(S, O, K,) or مَتَاعًا, (TA,) this meaning, [as also
the former phrase,] I gave to him a garment, or
piece of cloth, [or a commodity,] in place of his
due: (S, O, K:) and in like manner, عرضت بِهِ.
(El-Umawee, TA.) And عَرَضْتُ البَعِيرَ عَلَى
الحَوْضِ, which is an instance of inversion, meaning عَرَضْتُ الحَوْضَ عَلَى البَعِيرِ [I showed the
watering-trough to the camel]: (S, O, Msb:) [or
it agrees in meaning with the phrase] عَرَضَ النَّاقَةَ
عَلَى الحَوْضِ, and ↓ أَعْرَضَهَا, [as rendered] He
offered to the she-camel to drink [at the wateringtrough]. (L, TA.) And عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى السَّيْفِ [lit.
He exposed them to the sword; (see also 2;)
meaning] he slew them (S, A, O, Msb, K) with
the sword. (Msb.) And عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى السَّوْطِ He
beat them with the whip; he flogged them. (K, *
TA.) And عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى النَّارِ He burned them.
(A, TA.) And عَرَضْتُ العَسَلَ عَلَى النَّارِ I cooked
the honey [upon the fire] to separate it from the
wax. (Msb.) [And عَرَضَ نَفْسَهُ لِلْهَلَاكِ He exposed himself to destruction.] ―
-b2-  عَرْضٌ also signifies The bringing a man before a judge, and
accusing him. (IAar, in TA, art. عقب.) [And
The presenting, or addressing, a petition, &c.,
with عَلَى or لِ before the word signifying the
person to whom it is presented or addressed.] ―
-b3-
One says also, مَا يَعْرِضُكَ لِفُلَانٍ, (S, [so in two
copies,] and O,) or مَا يَعْرُضَكَ, (L, TA,) with fet-h
to the ى and damm to the ر, (L,) the verb being
coordinate to نَصَرَ: (TA:) [app. meaning What
causeth thee to present thyself to such a one?]:
Yaakoob disallows one's saying ↓ مَا يُعَرِّضُكَ
لِفُلَانٍ, with teshdeed. (S, O, TA.) [But the latter
of these two verbs has a signification nearly allied
to that which is here assigned to the former, and
exactly agreeing with one mentioned before. See
2.] ―
-b4-  عَرَضَ الجُنْدَ, (S, Msb,) and عَرَضَ الجُنْدَ
عَرْضَ العَيْنِ, (S, O,) or عَرْضَ عَيْنٍ, (A, K, B,
except that in the A and B we find الجَيْشَ instead of الجند,) aor.
عَرِضَ, (Msb,) inf. n. عَرْضٌ,
(Yoo, S,) He made the army, or body of soldiers,
to pass by him, and examined their state, (S, O, K,)
what it was: (S, O:) [i. e. he reviewed them:] or
he made them to pass before him in review, that
he might know who was absent and who was present: (A, B:) or he caused them to come forth,
and examined them, that he might know them:
(Msb:) and you say also, ↓ اعترضهُمْ, (S, O, K,)
meaning [the same, or] he made them to pass by
him, or before him, and examined them, one by
one, (K, TA,) to see who were absent from those
who were present. (TA.) You say also, ↓ اعترض
المَتَاعَ وَنَحْوَهُ and عَلَى عَيْنِهِ ↓ اعترضهُ [He examined the commodity, and the like thereof, having
it displayed before his eye]. (Th.) [See also عَرْضٌ.]
―
-b5-  عَرَضْتُ الكِتَابَ, (S, O, Msb,) aor.
عَرِضَ, inf. n.
عَرْضٌ, (Msb,) I read, or recited, the writing, or
book: (O, TA: [in the S it is unexplained, but
immediately followed by عَرَضْتُ الجُنْدَ عَرْضَ
العَيْنِ:]) or I recited it by heart, or memory.
(Msb.)
-A4-  عَرَضَ عِرْضَهُ, aor.
عَرِضَ; (TA;) and ↓ اعترضهُ;
(A, TA;) [perhaps originally signified He examined his grounds of pretension to respect, or the
like: and then became used to express a frequent
consequence of doing so; i. e.] he spoke evil of
him; reviled him; detracted from his reputation:
(A, TA:) or he corresponded to him, or equalled
him, in grounds of pretension to respect: (TA:)
[the former seems to be the more probable of the
two meanings; for it is said that] فُلَانًا ↓ اعترض
signifies he spoke evil of such a one; reviled him;
detracted from his reputation; (Lth, S, O, K;)
and annoyed him. (Lth, TA.)
-A5-  عَرَضَ الشَّىْءَ,

عَرِضَ, inf. n. عَرْضٌ, (TA,) He hit the side
(عُرْض) of the thing. (K.)

الإِنَآءِ, (S, O, Msb, K,) and السَّيْفَ عَلَى فَخِذِهِ,
(S, O, K,) aor.
عَرُضَ and
عَرِضَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) in both
phrases, (O, K,) [J says, in the S, app. referring,
not, as SM thinks, to the latter of the two phrases,
but to the meaning, “this, only, with damm,”]
He put the stick breadthwise, across, athwart, or
crosswise, (مَعْرُوضًا, TA, or بِالعَرْضِ, Msb, TA,
both meaning the same, TA,) upon the vessel,
(Msb, TA,) [and so the sword upon his thigh:
and ↓ عرّضهُ signifies the same.] ―
-b2-  عَرَضَ الرُّمْحَ,
aor.
عَرِضَ, [and probably
عَرُضَ also,] inf. n. عَرْضٌ; and
↓ عرّضهُ, inf. n. تَعْرِيضٌ; (TA:) He turned, or

عَرَضَ الرَّامِى القَوْسَ, inf. n. عَرْضٌ, The archer laid
the bow upon its side on the ground, and then shot

-b4-  The saying of Aboo-Kebeer
El-Hudhalee, cited, but not expl., by Th,
فَعَرَضْتُهُ فِى سَاقِ أَسْمَنِهَا
is thought by ISd to mean And I made its (the
sword's) breadth to become concealed in the thigh
of the fattest of them. (TA.)
-A7-  عَرَضَهُ He fed
him: (Fr, TA:) [or he offered, or presented, to

-b2-
عَرَضَ الحَوْضَ and القِرْبَةَ He filled the wateringtrough and the water-skin. (K.)
-A8-  عَرَضَ الشَّوْكَ:
see 8, near the end.
-A9-  عَرَضَ بَعِيرَهُ, inf. n. عَرْضٌ,
He branded his camel with the mark called عِرَاض;

broad, or wide; (S, K;) as also ↓ اعرضهُ, (Lth,
S, K,) inf. n. إِعْرَاضٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also 1, near
the end, in three places. ―
-b3-  تَعَرِيضٌ also signifies
The speaking obliquely, indirectly, obscurely, ambiguously, or equivocally; contr. of تَصْرِيحٌ; (S,
Mgh, Msb, K;) as when thou askest a man,
“ Hast thou seen such a one? ” and he, having
seen him, and disliking to lie, answers, “Verily
such a one is seen: ” (Msb:) or the making a
phrase, or the like, to convey an allusion, or an
indication not expressly mentioned therein; as when
you say “ How foul is niggardliness! ” alluding
to such a one's being a niggard (تُعَرِّضُ بِأَنَّهُ
بَخِيلٌ): differing from كِنَايَةٌ, which is the mentioning of the consequence and meaning that of
which it is the consequence; as when you say
“ Such a one has a long suspensory cord to his
sword, and has many ashes of the cooking-pot; ”
meaning that he is tall of stature, and one who
entertains many guests: (Mgh:) [but many hold
these two words to be identical in meaning.]
You say, عَرَّضْتُ لِفُلَانٍ and بِفُلَانٍ, i. e. I said
something [in the manner explained above], meaning such a one. (S, Msb.) [See also an ex. voce
كَلَّآءٌ.] 'Omar defined [or rather explained]
التَّعْرِيضُ بِالفَاحِشَةِ [The making an allusion to that
which is foul, or obscene] by the instance of a man
saying to another “ My father is not an adulterer,
nor is my mother an adulteress. ” (O, TA.) Or,
accord. to the early authorities, عرّض signifies
He used a phrase susceptible of different meanings,
or an equivocal phrase, by which the hearer understood a meaning different from that which he
(the speaker) intended: or, accord. to the later
authorities, as Et-Teftezánee, he mentioned a thing
by a proper or tropical or metonymical expression,
to signify some other thing, which he did not mention; as when one says, “I heard him whom
thou hatest praying for thee, and making good
mention of thee; ” meaning in his praying for
the Muslims in general. (El-Munáwee, in explaining the trad. إِنَّ فِى المَعَارِيضِ الخ, which see
below, voce مِعْرَاضٌ.) تعريض with respect to the
demanding of a woman in marriage in [the period
of] her عِدَّة, [during which she may not contract
a new marriage,] is the using language which
resembles a demand of her in marriage, but does
not plainly express it; as the saying to her
“ Verily thou art beautiful,” or “ Verily there
is a desire for thee,” or “ Verily women are of
the things that I need: ” and تعريض is sometimes
made by the quoting of proverbs, and by the introducing of enigmas in one's speech. (TA.)
[When followed by عَلَى, it signifies The making
an indirect objection against a person or saying

article ال prefixed to it, by the words أَنْ يَجْعَلَ

copies; the latter (which see, last sentence but
one,) app. the right reading; meaning مَعْرُوضًا,
whichever be the right; for an inf. n. may be
used in the sense of a pass. part. n.; and many a
word of the measure فَعَلٌ is used in that sense,
as, for instance, خَبَطٌ and نَفَضٌ and هَدَمٌ. That
I have rightly rendered the above-mentioned explanation in the K is indicated by what here immediately follows.]) Hence the trad. مَا عَظُمَتْ

لِلزَّوَالِ [The blessing of God upon a servant, or
man, hath not become great but the burden of
other men upon him hath become great; and he
who doth not take upon himself that burden causeth
that blessing to be exposed to cessation]. (O, TA.)
You also say, هُوَ لَهُ ↓ عَرَّضْتُ فُلَانًا لِكَذَا فَتَعَرَّضَ [I

him, to such a thing, and he exposed himself, or

عَاْرَضَ [عَارضهُ has two contr. significations, which
are unequivocally expressed by saying عارضهُ
بِالخِلَافِ and عارضهُ بِالوِفَاقِ. (See عَانَدَهُ.) Thus
one says,] عارضهُ, (Msb,) inf. n. مُعَارَضَةٌ, (TA,)
He opposed him [being opposed by him]. (Kull
p. 342.) ―
-b2-  And [He vied, competed, or contended
for superiority, with him; emulated, rivalled, or
imitated, him;] he did like as he (the latter) did.
(Msb, TA.) You say also, عَارَضْتُهُ بِمِثْلِ مَا صَنَعَ,
(S, O,) or بِمِثْلِ صَنِيعِهِ, (K,) I did to him like
as he did: (S, O, K:) whence المُعَارَضَة [in trafficking, as will be seen below]: as though the

And عارضهُ بِمَا صَنَعَهُ He requited him for that
which he did. (L.) ―
-b3-  [Hence] مُعَارَضَةٌ also signifies The selling a commodity for another commodity; exchanging it for another; as also عَرْضٌ:
(TA:) and [in like manner] ↓ تَعْرِيضٌ, the act of
bartering, or selling a commodity for a like

(TA;) He exchanged his commodity; giving one
commodity and taking another; (TA:) and
مَتَاعَهُ ↓ عرّض he sold his commodity for another

manner عارضهُ بِالفَخْرِ. (K in art. فخر.) See 6.

or on the opposite side to him; (S, A, O, K;) in
a corresponding manner; (TA;) [each taking

[cited in the S, voce رَيِّق, but with رَيْقَ, in the
place of رَوْقَ, and there ascribed to Lebeed,]
meaning, accord. to ISk, [We praised to her the
first part of youth, and thereupon] she took to the
side of الصبا [or youthful foolishness, and amorous
dalliance], or, as another says, she entered with
us into it, in a manner not open, but making it
appear to us that she was entering with us; جناب
الصبا meaning جَنْبَهُ. (TA.) ―
-b8-  عارض الجِنَازَةَ He
came to the bier, or the bier conveying the corpse,
intermediately (مُعْتَرِضًا), in a part of the way, not

↓ عرّض: see مُعَرِّضٌ.]
5
تعرّض: see عَرَضَ, near the beginning, where
these two verbs, and اعرض and اعترض, are said
to be used as syn.; [app. as meaning It showed,
presented, or offered, itself, to a person; lit. it
showed, or presented, its breadth, or width; or,
as تعرّض is expl. in the EM p. 19, it showed its
عُرْض, i. e. side: this, or it, or he, presented, or
offered, or exposed, its, or his, side, seems to be
the primary signification of تعرّض, and of اعترض,
as well as of عَرَضَ; and is of frequent occurrence: and all (as mentioned voce عَرَضَ) signify
also he obtruded himself in an affair; interfered
therein.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,] تعرّض لَهُ He opposed himself to him; he offered opposition to him; or he
attacked him; said of a man, and of a beast of
prey, or noxious reptile, and the like; as also
↓ عَرَضَ and ↓ اعترض: this signification also is of

-b3-
[Hence also,] He addressed, or applied, or directed, himself, or his regard, or attention, or
mind, to him, or it; [as though he set himself
over against the object to which the verb relates;]
syn. تَصَدَّى. (Lth, Lh, S, O, Msb, K.) So in
the saying, تعرّض لِمَعْرُوفِهِمْ and مَعْرُوفَهُمْ [He
addressed himself, &c., presented himself, betook
himself, advanced, came forward, or went forward, or attempted, to obtain their favour, or
bounty]: and تعرّض لِلْمَعْرُوفِ and المَعْرُوفَ [He
addressed himself, &c., to obtain favour, or
bounty; and] he sought, or demanded, it: (Az,
Msb:) and [so] للمعروف ↓ اعترض (Msb in art.
عر. [See also اعترض لَهُ.]) So too in the saying,
تَعَرَّضُوا لِنَفَحَاتِ رَحْمَةِ اللّٰهِ [Address ye yourselves,
&c., to become objects of the effusions of the mercy
of God]; (O, K, TA;) occurring in a trad.
(TA.) And hence the saying, تعرّض فِى شَهَادَتِهِ
لِكَذَا He addressed himself, &c., (تصدّى,) in his
testimony, to the mention of such a thing. (Msb.)
It is likewise syn. with تصدّى in the saying,
تعرّض لِى فُلَانٌ بِمَكْرُوهٍ [Such a one addressed himself, &c., or attempted, to do me an abominable,
or evil, action; or opposed himself to me with an
abominable, or evil, action]. (Lth.) [In like
manner also you say,] يَتَعَرَّضُ لِلنَّاسِ بِالشَّرِّ [He
addresses himself, &c., to do to men evil; or he
opposes himself to men with evil or mischief]. (S,
K.) And مَا تَعَرَّضْتُ لَهُ بِسُوْءٍ [I did not address
myself, or have not addressed myself, &c., to do to
him evil]: and ↓ مَا عَرَضْتُ and ↓ مَا عَرِضْتُ are
said to signify the same. (Msb.) [See 1.] You
say also, تَعَرَّضْتُ أَسْأَلُهُمْ [I addressed myself, &c.,
to ask them]. (S, O. *) And جَآءَ فُلَانٌ يَتَعَرَّضُ,
and يَتَضَرَّعُ, Such a one came asking, or petitioning, to another, for a thing that he wanted. (Fr,
in S, art.ضرع.) ―
-b4-  And تعرّض الرِّفَاقَ He asked the
companies of travellers for what are termed
عُرَاضَات [pl. of عُرَاضَةٌ, q. v.]. (TA.) ―
-b5-  تعرّض
لِكَذَا [also signifies He exposed himself, or became
exposed, to such a thing]. (S.) See 2, latter portion. ―
-b6-  Also تعرّض, [from عُرْضٌ,] He, or it,
turned aside; turned from the right course or
direction; syn. تَعَوَّجَ; (S, K, TA;) and زَاغَ:
(TA:) his, or its, course, or march, was, or became, indirect, or oblique. (L, TA.) You say,
تعرّض الجَمَلُ فِى الجَبَلِ The camel went to the
right and left, [in, or upon, the mountain,] on account of the difficulty of the road, or way. (S,
O, K.) And تَعَرَّضَتِ الإِبِلُ المَدَارِجَ The camels
went along the routes (فِى المَدَارِجِ) [المَدَارِجَ being
in the accus. case because فى is understood, not
that the verb is trans.] to the right and left;
(A;) i. e., alternately to the right and left. (T
in art. ثنى.) [See a verse cited voce تَصَدَّفَ, and
its explanation.] Dhu-l-Bijádeyn, being guide
to the Apostle, addressing his she-camel, said,
تَعَرَّضِى مَدَارِجًا وَسُومِى
تَعَرُّضَ الجَوْزَآءِ لِلنُّجُومِ
هٰذَا أَبُو القَاسِمِ فَاسْتَقِيمِى
(S, O) Go thou along routes to the right and left,
avoiding the rugged acclivities, [and continue thy
course, or as expl. in the TA, art. سوم, pass along
quickly,] (TA,) like as الجوزاء [Orion] passes
along in the sky obliquely, or indirectly, in the
disposition of its stars [with respect to the other
stars: (see 3, towards the end:) this is Abu-l-
Kásim; therefore go thou right]. (IAth, TA.)
―
-b7-  تعرّض الفَرَسُ فِى رَسَنِهِ i. q. اعترض, q. v. (TA.)
You say also, of a camel, فِى سَيْرِهِ ↓ يَعْتَرِضُ [He
inclines towards one side, in his march, or course;
or goes obliquely, or inclining towards one side].
(K: and so in one copy of the S: in another
copy of the S, يَتَعَرَّضُ. [See also 3, last quarter.])
―
-b8-  تعرّض also signifies It (a thing) became infected, vitiated, or corrupted; and in this sense
it is said of love: (TA:) [as though it turned
from the right course, or direction; a signification
mentioned before; and thus it is expl. in the S,
as occurring in the phrase تعرّض وَصْلُهُ, in the
Mo'allakah of Lebeed; or, thus used, it signifies]
it (a person's attachment to another) became
altered, so as to cease. (EM p. 149.)
6

used in this sense.]) ―
-b2-  They fought, or combated,
each other. (MA.) ―
-b3-  They did each like as the
other did; they imitated each other: they vied,
competed, or contended, each with the other; they
emulated, or rivalled, each other: (TA in art.
برى:) syn. تَبَارَيَا. (K in that art.)
8
اعترض: see عَرَضَ, near the beginning,
where these two verbs and اعرض and تعرّض, are
said to be used as syn., app. in the senses expl.
there and in the beginning of 5. ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
اعترض عَلَيْهِ He opposed, resisted, or withstood,
him, or it; syn. اِمْتَنَعَ. (MA.) [See 1 in art.
شنف, in two places.] ―
-b3-  See also 5, second sentence. ―
-b4-  And see from عَرَضَ لَهُ as signifying “ it
happened to him ” as far as the end of the sentence explaining اعترض الشَّىْءُ دُونَ الشَّىْءِ.
اعترض signifies [It lay, or extended, breadthwise,
across, transversely, athwart, sideways, obliquely,
or horizontally: or so as to present an obstacle:
or so intervened in any manner; as shown in the
part last referred to, above: or rather it has both
of these meanings; and in the former sense it is
used, in the TA, art. حر, in describing the direction of an asterism, opposed to اِنْتَصَبَ: or, in
other words,] it (a thing, S) became, (K,) or became an obstacle, (صَارَ عَارِضًا, S, O,) like a piece
of wood lying across, or athwart, or obliquely,
(مُعْتَرِضَةً,) in a channel of running water, (S, O, K,)
or a road, (O, L,) and the like, preventing persons
from passing along it. (L.) It is also said [of a collection of clouds appearing, or presenting itself, or
extending sideways, or stretching along in the horizon like a mountain; see عَارِضٌ: and] of a building,
or other thing, such as a trunk of a palm-tree, or
a mountain, lying in a road: and as this prevents
the passengers from passing along the road, it is
used as signifying He, or it, prevented, or hindered: (O, K:) it is quasi-pass. of عَرَضَهُ. (K, *
TA.) [And hence,] اُعْتُرِضَ عَنِ امْرَأَتِهِ, (O, TA,)
not اِعْتَرَضَ, as the K seems to indicate, (TA,)
He was prevented from going in to his wife, by an
obstacle that befell him, arising from the jinn,
or genii, or from disease: (O, K, TA:) occurring in a trad. (TA.) ―
-b5-  [Hence,] اِعْتِرَاضٌ
which is forbidden in a trad. [respecting horseracing] signifies A man's coming intermediately
with his horse, in a part of the course, and so
entering among the [other] horses. (O, L, K.)
[See also عَارَضَ الجِنَازَةَ.] ―

p. 687.) ―
-b9-  اعترض الفَرَسُ فِى رَسَنِهِ The horse was
perverse, untoward, or intractable, [in his halter,]
to his leader; (S, A, O, K;) as also ↓ تعرّض.
(TA. [See مُعْتَرِضٌ.]) And اِعْتَرِاضٌ in a man is
The appearing and engaging in what is vain, or
false, and refusing to obey the truth. (TA.) ―
-b10-
اعترضهُ He faced him, and advanced towards him:
(Har p. 420) and اعترض عَرْضَهُ and عُرْضَهُ [has
nearly, if not exactly, the same signification]:
see عَرَضَ. And اعتراض also signifies The coming
in upon any one: or entering upon an affair. (Har
p. 687.) ―
-b11-  [اعترض لَهُ often means He presented
himself, or advanced, or came forward, to him:
and he addressed or betook himself, or advanced, or
went forward, to it; namely, an action; like تعرّض
له: see its syns. اِنْبَرَى and تَبَرَّى.] ―

upon the beast. (S, O.) ―
-b2-  اعترض الجُنْدُ The
army, or body of soldiers, was reviewed: (Mgh,
L:) quasi-pass. of عَرَضَ الجُنْدَ [which signifies
the same as the phrase next following]. (O, L,
TA.) ―

TA.) He ate the thorns: and الشَّوْكَ ↓ عَرَضَ, aor.
عَرُضَ,
inf. n. عَرَضَ, he took and ate of the thorns: both

(TA:) and [in like manner] one says of a camel,

iii. 127,] عَرْضُهَا السَّمٰوَاتُ والأَرْضُ [the breadth, or
width, whereof is as the heavens and the earth]:

described as being much, it indicates that the طُول
is much, for the latter is more than the former.
(O, TA.) You say also, عَرَضَ عَرْضَهُ, and ↓ عُرْضَهُ,
He went towards him: [lit. towards his breadth,

has a more comprehensive signification; everything that is termed عَرْضٌ being included in عَرَضٌ,

from thyself for the day of thy poverty: but see

[It is only sweat which flows from their bodies].

of odour], and مُنْتِنُ العِرْضِ [foul in respect of
odour]; and سِقَآءٌ خَبِيثُ العِرْضِ a stinking water-skin, or milk-skin; from A'Obeyd. (S, O.) ―
-b6-
A man's honour, or reputation, (جَانِبُهُ,) which he
preserves from impairment and blame, both as it
relates to himself and to his حَسَب [or grounds of
pretension to respect on account of the honourable
deeds or qualities of his ancestors, &c.]: (IAth,
O, K:) or whether it relate to himself or to his
ancestors or to those of whose affairs the management is incumbent on him: (K:) or a subject of
praise, and of blame, of a man, (Abu-l-'Abbás,
IAth, O, K,) whether it be in himself or in his
ancestors or in those of whose affairs the management is incumbent on him: (IAth:) or those
things by the mention whereof with praise or dispraise a man rises or falls; which may be things
whereby he is characterized exclusively of his
ancestors; and it may be that his ancestors are
mentioned in such a manner that imperfection
shall attach to him by reason of the blaming of
them. respecting this there is no disagreement
among the lexicologists, except IKt [whose objection see in what follows]: (Abu-l-'Abbás, O:) or
(accord. to some, S) grounds of pretension to
respect on account of the honourable deeds or
qualities of one's ancestors, &c., (حَسَبٌ, S, Msb,
K,) and eminence, or nobility, (شَرَفٌ,) in which
one glories. (K.) You say, فُلَانٌ كَرِيمُ العِرْضِ
Such a one is generous, or noble, in respect of
حَسَب: and هُوَ ذُو عِرْضٍ he is a possessor of
حَسَب; and of شَرَف. (TA.) ―
-b7-  Sometimes,
Ancestors are meant by it. (A'Obeyd, K.) Thus
you say, شَتَمَ فُلَانٌ عِرْضَ فُلَانٍ, meaning Such a
one spoke evil of the ancestors of such a one.
(A'Obeyd.) And فُلَانٌ جَرِبُ العِرْضِ Such a one
is base, or ignoble, in respect of ancestry. (TA.)
IKt disallows this signification, asserting عِرْضٌ
to have no other signification than those of a
man's نَفْس and his بَدَن: (O, * TA:) but I Amb
says that this is an error; as is shown by the
saying of Aboo-Miskeen Ed-Dárimee,
رُبَّ مَهْزُولٍ سَمِينٌ عِرْضُهُ
وَسَمِينِ الجِسْمِ مَهْزُولُ الحَسَبْ
in which عِرْض cannot be syn. with بَدَن and جِسْم,
for, were it so, it would involve a contradiction;
the meaning being only Many a person meagre
in respect of his body is noble [or great] in respect
of his ancestry; [and fat in respect of the body,
meagre in respect of grounds of pretension to
honour on account of the honourable deeds or
qualities of his ancestors, &c.:] and by Mohammad's using the expression دَمُهُ وَعِرْضُهُ; for if
عِرْض were [here] syn. with نَفْس, it had sufficed
to say دمه without عرضه. (O, TA.) ―
-b8-  Also
A natural disposition that is commended. (IAth,
K.) ―
-b9-  And A good action. (TA.)
-A5-  Also One
who speaks evil of men (يَعْتَرِضُهُمْ) falsely; (O,
K;) applied to a man: and so with عِرْضَنٌ applied to a
woman: (O, K: *) so too ↓ ة applied to a
man, and with عَرْضَنٌ to a woman. (TA.)
عَرَضٌ A thing that happens to, befalls, or occurs
to, a man; such as disease, and the like; (S, O,
K;) as disquietude of mind, and a state of distraction of the mind or attention: or a misfortune,
such as death, and disease, and the like: (TA:)
or an event that happens to a man, whereby he is
tried: (As:) or a thing that happens to a man,
whereby he is impeded; such as disease, or a theft:
(Lh:) or a bane, or cause of mischief, that occurs
in a thing; as also ↓ عَارِضٌ: (TA:) [both signify also an accident of any kind:] pl. أَعْرَاضٌ.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  A thing's befalling, or hitting, unexpectedly. (O, K. [I follow the reading of the
O, which is that of the K as given in the TA,
and of my MS. copy of the K, أَنْ يُصِيبَ الشَّىْءُ
عَلَى غِرَّةٍ; in preference to that in the CK, أَنْ
تُصِيبَ الشَّىْءَ عَلَى غِرَّةٍ.]) You say, أَصَابَهُ سَهْمُ
عَرَضٍ (S, A, O, K *) and سَهْمٌ عَرَضٌ, (A, TA,) and
حَجَرُ عَرَضٍ (S, O) and حَجَرٌ عَرَضٌ, (TA,) [A random arrow, and a random stone, or] an arrow,
and a stone, aimed at another, hit him: (S, O,
K:) such as hits, or falls upon, a man without
any one's shooting it, or casting it, is not thus
termed. (L.) And مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ الرَّأْىِ عَرَضًا خَيْرٌ
مِمَّا جَآءَكَ مُسْتَكْرَهًا, i. e. [The opinion] that comes
to thee without consideration, or thought, [is better
than that which comes to thee forced.] (TA.)
And عُلِّقْتُهَا عَرَضًا I became attached to her (S, O,
K) accidentally, or unintentionally, (S, O,) in
consequence of her presenting herself to me (ISk,
S, O, K) as a thing occurring without my seeking
it. (ISk.) [See an ex., in a verse of Antarah,
cited in the first paragraph of art. زعم; and
another, in a verse of El-Aashà, cited in the first
paragraph of art. علق.] ―
-b3-  A thing that is not
permanent: (Mgh, O, B, K.) so in the conventional language of the Muslim theologians:
(Mgh:) opposed to جَوْهَرٌ: (TA:) or hence metaphorically applied by the Muslim theologians
to (tropical:)  a thing that has not permanence unless in, or
by, the substance; [i. e., in the language of old logicians, an accident; an essential, and an accidental (as meaning a non-essential), property, or
quality; or what modern logicians call a mode;
whether it be, in their language, an essential mode
or an accidental mode; which latter only they
term “ an accident; ”] as colour, and taste: (B:)
or, in the conventional language of the Muslim
theologians (المُتَكَلِّمُون [expl. in the TA as signifying “ the philosophers,” from whom, however,
they are generally distinguished]), a thing that
subsists in, or by, another thing; (O, K;) as
colours, and tastes, and smells, and sounds, and
powers, and wills: (O: [and the like is said in
the Msb:]) or, in philosophy, a thing that exists
in its subject, or substance, and ceases therefrom
without the latter's becoming impaired or annihilated; and also such as does not cease therefrom:
the former kind being such as tawniness occasioned
by an altered state of the body, and yellowness of
complexion, and motion of a thing moving; and
the latter kind, such as the blackness of pitch, and
of [the beads called] سَبَج, and of the crow. (L.)
―
-b4-  [Hence, An appertenance of any kind. ―
-b5-
Hence also,] The frail goods (حُطَام) of the
present world or state; (As, O, K;) and what a
man acquires thereof: (As, O:) [so called as
being not permanent:] or worldly goods or commodities, (AO, Msb,) of whatever kind, are thus
called, with fet-h to the ر: (AO:) and any property or wealth, little or much, (S, O, K,) is thus
called, (K,) or is called عَرَضُ الدُّنْيَا. (S, O.)
See also عَرْضٌ, expl. as signifying “ a commodity,” or “ commodities ” or “ goods. ” One says,
الدُّنْيَا عَرَضٌ حَاضِرٌ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا البَرُّ وَالفَاجِرُ [The world
is a present frail good: the righteous and the unrighteous eat thereof]: (S, O, TA:) i. e. it has
no permanence: a trad. related by Sheddád Ibn-Ows. (TA.) And in another trad. related by
the same, it is said, لَيْسَ الغِنَى عَنْ كَثْرَةِ العَرَضِ
إِنَّمَا الغِنَى غِنَى النَّفْسِ [Richness is not from the
abundance of worldly goods: richness is only richness of the soul]. (O, TA.) One says also, قَدْ
فَاتَهُ العَرَضُ, (Yoo, S, L,) and ↓ العَرْضُ, but the
former is the more approved, (L,) [The property,
&c., (but see another meaning below,) had escaped him], which is from عَرْضُ الجُنْدِ, [see
عَرَضَ,] like as one says قَبَضَ قَبْضًا and قَدْ أَلْقَاهُ
فِى القَبَضِ: (Yoo, S:) [which seems to indicate
that عَرَضٌ properly signifies مَعْرُوضٌ, like as
قَبَضٌ signifies مَقْبُوضٌ.] ―
-b6-  Booty; spoil. (O,
K.) So in the Kur ix. 42: (O:) or it there signifies ―
-b7-  i. q. مَطْلَبٌ [app. meaning A thing
sought, or desired; and object of desire; rather
than a place where a thing is sought]. (TA.)
―
-b8-  I. q. طَمَعٌ [app. meaning A thing that is
eagerly desired, or coveted: and also eager desire;
or covetousness]. (AO, O, K.) So explained by
some as occurring in the saying قَدْ فَاتَهُ العَرَضُ,
mentioned above. (TA.) And the following
verse is also cited as an ex.,
مَنْ كَانَ يَرْجُو بَقَآءً لَا نَفَادَ لَهُ
فَلَا يَكُنْ عَرَضُ الدُّنْيَا لَهُ شَجَنَا
[Whoso hopeth for continuance without cessation,
let not the eager desire of worldly goods be to him
a cause of anxiety]. (O, TA.) ―
-b9-  A gift. (TA.)
See also عُرَاضَةٌ. ―
-b10-  هُوَ عَلَى عَرَضِ الوُجُودِ signifies
عَلَى إِمْكَانِهِ [app. meaning It is in the condition of
possibility of existence; for على seems to be here
used in the sense of فِى, as in some other instances]; from أَعْرَضَ لَهُ meaning “ it became within
his power,” &c. (Mgh.) And one says, هُوَ بِعَرَضٍ
أَنْ يَضِيعَ [He is exposed, or liable, to perish].
(Mgh voce ضَيَاعٌ.) ―
-b11-  جَعَلَ الشَّىْءَ عَرَضًا لِلشَّىْءِ, or
عَرْضًا, accord. to different copies of the K: see 2,
in the latter half of the paragraph, in two places.
عُرُضٌ, (L, TA,) in the K, erroneously, ↓ عُرْضٌ,
(TA,) A certain manner of going along, (K, TA,)
towards one side, (TA,) approved in horses, but
disapproved in camels. (K, TA.) ―
-b2-  نَظَرَ إِلَيْهِ عَنْ
عُرُضٍ: ―
-b3-  and رَأَيْتُهُ فِى عُرُضِ النَّاسِ: see عُرْضٌ.
عُرْضَةٌ is of the measure فُعْلَةٌ in the sense of the
measure مَفْعولٌ, like قُبْضَةٌ; (Bd, ii. 224;) and
is applied to A thing that is set as an obstacle in
the way of a thing: (Bd, TA:) and also to a
thing that is exposed to a thing: (Bd:) or that
is set as a butt, like the butt of archers. (TA.)
You say, جَعَلْتُ فُلَانًا عُرْضَةً لِكَذَا, meaning نَصَبْتُهُ
لَهُ; (S, O, K; *) i. e. I set such a one as an obstacle to such a thing: or as a butt for such a
thing. (TA.) And هُوَ لَهُ دُونَهُ عُرْضَةٌ He is an
obstacle to him intervening in the way of it. (S,
O.) And فُلَانٌ عُرْضَةٌ لِلنَّاسِ Such a one is [a butt
to men; i. e.] a person whom men cease not to
revile: (S, O, Msb, K:) or a person to whom
men address themselves to do evil, and whom they
revile. (Az, TA.) And هُمْ ضُعَفَآءُ عُرْضَةٌ لِكُلِّ مُتَنَاوِلٍ
They are weak persons; persons who offer themselves
as a prey to any one who would take them. (TA.)
And it is said in the Kur [ii. 224], وَلَا تَجْعَلُوا
اللّٰهُ عُرْضَةً لِأَيْمَانِكُمْ أَنْ تَبَرُّوا وَتَتَّقُوا وَتُصْلِحُوا بَيْنَ
النَّاسِ, (S, * &c.,) meaning نَصْبًا; (S, TA;) admitting the two significations of an obstacle and a
butt: (TA:) i. e. And make not God an obstacle
between you and that which may bring you near
unto God, &c.: (O, K:) or make not God an
obstacle to the performance of your oaths to be
pious (O, Bd) and to fear God and to make reconciliation between men: or make not God an
obstacle, because of your oaths, to your being pious
&c.: (Bd:) or make not the swearing by God an
obstacle to your being pious [&c.]: (Fr:) and Zj
says the like of this: (L:) or عُرْضَةٌ signifies intervention with respect to good and evil; (Abu-l-
'Abbás, O, K;) and the meaning is, do not intervene by swearing by God every little while so as
not to be pious &c.: (O, K, * TA:) or make not
God an object of your oaths, by ordinary and
frequent swearing by Him, (Bd,) or a butt for
your oaths, like the butt of archers, (TA,) in
order that ye may be pious &c.; for the habitual
swearer emboldens himself against God, and is
not pious &c.: (Bd:) or, as some say, the meaning is make not the mention of God a means of
strengthening your oaths. (TA.) You say also,
هٰذَا عُرْضَةٌ لَكَ as meaning This is a thing prepared
for thy common, or ordinary, use. (O, TA.) ―
-b2-
A purpose; an intention; or an object of desire,
or of endeavour; [as though it were a butt;]
syn. هِمَّةٌ. (S, O, K.) Hassán says, (S, O,) i. e.
Ibn-Thábit, (O, TA,)
وَقَالَ اللّٰهُ قَدْ يَسَّرْتُ جُنْدًا
هُمُ الأَنْصَارُ عُرْضَتُهَا اللِّقَآءُ
[And God said I have prepared an army: they
are the Ansár; whose purpose, or the object of whose
desire, is conflict with the unbelievers]. (S, O,
TA. [In one copy of the S, in the place of يَسَّرْتُ,
I find أَعْدَدْتُ, which signifies the same.]) ―
-b3-  A
pretext; an excuse. (MA.) ―
-b4-  One says also,
فُلَانٌ عُرْضَةُ ذَاكَ, (S, O,) or عُرْضَةٌ لِذَاكَ, (S, O, K,)
Such a one is possessed of the requisite ability and
strength for that: (S, O, K:) and عُرْضَةٌ لِلشَّرِّ possessed of strength to do evil, or mischief: and in
like manner عُرْضَةٌ is applied to two things, and to
more. (TA.) And فُلَانَةُ عُرْضَةٌ لِلزَّوْجِ (S, O, K)
Such a female is possessed of sufficient strength for
the husband; [i. e., to be married;] (TA;) or
لِلنِّكَاحِ for marriage. (A.) And نَاقَةٌ عُرْضَةٌ
لِلْحِجَارَةِ A she-camel having strength enough for
[going upon] the stones. (S, O, K.) And [in
like manner] أَسْفَارٍ ↓ نَاقَةٌ عُرْضُ A she-camel having
strength sufficient for journeys. (S, O, K. *) And
هٰذَا البَعِيرِ السَّفَرُ وَالحَجَرُ ↓ عُرْضُ (S, O, K) The
strength of this camel is sufficient for journeying
and for going over stone. (IB.)
-A2-  عُرْضَةٌ also
signifies A kind of trick, or artifice, in wrestling,
(S, O, K,) by which one throws down men.
(S, O.)
عَرْضِىٌّ [in the CK عَرْضٰى] A kind of cloths or
garments. (S, O, K.) ―
-b2-  And Certain of the appertenances (مَرَافِق, O, K) and chambers (O) of
the house: a word of the dial. of El-'Irák: (O,
K:) unknown to the Arabs. (O.)
عُرْضِىٌّ A camel that goes obliquely, or inclining
towards one side, because not yet completely trained:
(S, O, K:) or submissive in the middle part [or
body, so as to be easy to ride, but] difficult of
management: and perverse, untoward, or intractable: and with ة, a she-camel not completely
trained: (TA:) or difficult to manage; refractory. (S, O, K.) See also عَرُوضٌ. ―
-b2-  One
who does not sit steadily, or firmly, upon the
saddle; (IAar, O, K;) inclining at one time this
way, and at another time that way. (IAar, O.)
يَمْشِى بِالعَرْضِيَّةِ, and ↓ بِالعُرْضِيَّةِ, the latter from
Lh, He goes sideways. (TA.)
عُرْضِيَّةٌ: see what next precedes. Refractoriness, and a random or heedless manner of going,
by reason of pride: in a horse, the going sideways: and in a she-camel, the state of being untrained: (TA:) and in a man, [so expressly
shown in the S and TA; but in the CK, قِيلَ is
erroneously put for فِيكَ;] what resembles roughness, ungentleness, or awkwardness; want of due
care, by reason of haste; (syn. عَجْرَفِيَّةٌ;) and
pride; and refractoriness. (AZ, S, O, K.)

like زِمِكَّى; (K;) Briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness. (IAar, O, K. [See also عِرَضْنَةٌ.]) ―
-b2-  And
[app. for ذُو عِرَضَّى] meaning also Brisk, lively,
or sprightly. (TA. [See, again, عِرَضْنَةٌ.])
عِرْضَنٌ; fem. with ة: see عِرْضٌ, last sentence.
عِرَضْنَةٌ An oblique course or motion: (A'Obeyd,
L, TA:) and briskness, liveliness, sprightliness:
and عِرِضْنَةٌ signifies the same. (TA. [See also
عِرَِضَّى.]) One says, يَمْشِى العِرَضْنَةَ and ↓ العِرَضْنَى
He goes along with a proud gait, (S, O, K,) inclining towards one side, (S, O,) by reason of his
briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness. (S, O, K.)
And ↓ تَعْدُو العِرَضْنَى and العِرَضْنَةَ and العِرَضْنَاةَ
[perhaps correctly العِرَضْنَاتَ] She (a mare) runs
in a sidelong manner, one time in one direction
and another time in another. (O, TA.) And
يَعْدُو العِرَضْنَةَ He (a man) runs so that he outstrips. (L, TA.) And نَظَرْتُ إِلَى فُلَانٍ عِرَضْنَةً I
looked towards such a one from the outer angle
of my eye. (S, O, K. *) The dim. of ↓ عِرَضْنَى
is ↓ عُرَيْضِنٌ; the ن being retained because it is a
letter of quasi-coordination, and the ى suppressed
because it is not such. (S, O.) ―
-b2-  Also, [app.
for ذَاتُ عِرَضْنَةٍ,] A she-camel that goes along
obliquely, (S, O, K,) by reason of briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness: pl. عِرَضْنَاتٌ. (S, O. [See,

عُرْضٌ, in the latter half of the paragraph.
عِرَاضٌ: see عُرْضٌ, in the first sentence, and

paragraph. ―
-b2-  أَخَذَ فِى عِرَاضِ كَلَامِهِ He began

her middle part; that is loaded; and then the
other loaded camels are driven on; and if a man
ride her, she goes straight forward, and her rider
has not the power of exercising his own free will

'Omar likened a class of his subjects. (TA.)
And 'Amr Ibn-Ahmar El-Báhilee says,
أُخِبُّ ذَلُولًا أَوْ عَرُوضًا أَرُوضُهَا
[I make a submissive one to go the pace termed
خَبَب, or an untrained one I train]; meaning
that he recites two poems; one of which he has

and كَلَامِهِ ↓ فِى مِعْرَاضِ; (A, O;) and in like
manner, مَعَارِضِ كَلَامِهِ: (L, TA:) and عَرَفْتُهُ فِى

عَرُوضٌ also signifies The transverse pole or piece
of wood (عَارضَة) which is in the middle of a tent,

―
-b2-  And hence, (Aboo-Is-hák,) The middle portion [or foot] of a verse; (Aboo-Is-hák, O;) for
the بَيْت of poetry is constructed after the manner
of the بَيْت inhabited by the Arabs, which is of
pieces of cloth; and as the عروض of the latter is
the strongest part, so should that of the former
be; and accordingly we see that a deficiency in
the ضَرْب is more frequent than it is in the عروض:
(Aboo-Is-hák:) the last foot of the first half or
hemistich (S, K) of a verse; (S;) whether perfect
or altered: (K:) some make it to be the طَرَائِق
of poetry, and its عَمُود: (TA:) [i. e. they liken
it to these parts of the tents:] it is fem.: (K:)
or sometimes masc.: (L:) the pl. is أَعَارِيضُ; (S,
O, K;) contr. to rule, as though pl. of إِعْرِيضٌ;
and one may use as its pl. أَعَارِضُ. (S, O.) ―

Also [The science of prosody, or versification;] the
science of the rules whereby the perfect measures of
Arabic verse are known from those which are
broken; (Msb;) the standard whereby verse is
measured: (S, O, K:) because it is compared
(يُعَارَضُ) therewith: (S, O:) or because what is
correct in measure is thereby distinguished from
what is broken: (K: [in which some other reasons
are added, too futile, in my opinion, to deserve
mention: I think it more probable that عروض is
used by a synecdoche for شِعْرٌ, as being the most
essential part thereof; and then, elliptically, for
عِلْمُ العَرُوضِ, which is the more common term for
the science:]) it is fem.; and has no pl., because
it is a gen. n. (S, O.)
-A9-  See also عَارِضَةٌ; second
and two following sentences.
-A10-  العَرُوضُ is a name

Msb,) and of the latter, (S, K,) with ة: (S, Msb,
K:) the pl. of عَرِيضٌ is عِرَاضٌ, like as كِرَامٌ is pl.
of كَرِيمٌ. (Msb.) You say, عُرَاضَةٌ and
↓ عُرَاضَةٌ [A broad, or wide, bow]. (S.) And

latter word is in the accus. case as a specificative,

are broad. (S, O, TA.) And فُلَانٌ عَرِيضُ البِطَانِ
(assumed tropical:)  Such a one is rich; or in a state of competence:
(A, TA:) or possessed of much property. (S, *
O, K, * TA. [See also art. بطن.]) And عَرِيضُ

عَرِيضُ الوِسَادِ (tropical:)  Sleepy: (TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  stupid, dull,

[q. v.], (S, O,) when he rattles, and desires copulation: (S, O, K:) or a [young] goat above such
as is weaned and below such as is termed جَذَع
[q. v.]: or such as has pastured and become strong:
or such as is termed جَذَع: or a young goat when
he leaps the female: it is applied only to a male:
the female is termed عَرِيضَةٌ: with the people of
El-Hijáz it means peculiarly such as is gelded:
it is also applied to a gazelle that has nearly become a ثَنِىّ [q. v.]: (TA:) pl. عِرْضَانٌ and
عُرْضَانٌ. (S, O, K.)

عَرَضَ, first signification;) or] having its side

and also حَبِىٌّ: (As, O:) pl. عَوَارِضُ. (TA.)
[See also عَرْضٌ and عِرْضٌ.] In the phrase عَارِضٌ
مُمْطِرُنَا, in the Kur [xlvi. 23], ممطرنا means مُمْطِرٌ
لَنَا; for as being determinate it cannot be an epithet
to عَارِضٌ, which is indeterminate: and the like of
this the Arabs do only in the instances of nouns
derived from verbs; so that you may not say
هٰذَا رَجُلٌ غُلَامُنَا. (S, O.) ―

مِنْ شُبْهَةٍ ↓ قَلْبِهِ بِأَوَّلِ عَارِضَةٍ, the word عارضة may
perhaps be an inf. n., [or a quasi-inf. n.,] like عَاقِبَةٌ

Doubt makes an impression upon his heart at the
first occurrence of dubiousness.] ―

mouth: or the two sides of the beard: pl. عَوَارِضُ.
(TA.) خَفِيفُ العَارِضَيْنِ means Light, or scanty,

Msb,) and of the beard; (O;) being elliptical.

the mouth: (S, TA:) and Jereer describes a
woman as polishing her عَارِضَانِ with a branch
of a beshámeh, [a tree of which the twigs are
used for cleaning the teeth,] meaning, as Aboo-Nasr says, the teeth that are after the central incisors, which latter are not of the عوارض: or,
accord. to ISk, عَارِضٌ signifies the canine tooth
and the ضِرْس [or bicuspid] next thereto: or, as
some say, what are between the central incisor
and the [first] ضرس [which is a bicuspid]: (S,
O:) some say that the عوارض are the central incisors, as being [each] in the side of the mouth:
others, that they are the teeth next to the sides of
the mouth: others, that they are four teeth next

manner] ↓ عَرُوضٌ a want, or an object of need,

above assigned to it in the saying, فُلَانٌ رَكُوضٌ
بِلَا عَرُوضٍ [Such a one is running without any
want that has occurred to him]. (S, O. [In the
K, in the place of ركوض, we find رَبُوضٌ, which
I think a mistake.]) [In Freytag's Arab. Prov.
i. 555, we find ↓ رَكُوضٌ فِى كُلِّ عَرُوضٍ, which is
expl. as meaning Running swiftly in every region;
and said to be applied to him who disseminates
evil, or mischief, among men.]
-A2-  A she-camel

reason it is slaughtered; (S;) as also ↓ عَارِضٌ:
(O, K:) and in like manner, a sheep or goat:

لَا يَأْكُلُونَ إِلَّا العَوَارِضَ [The sons of such a one

turns. (O, K. [In some copies of the latter, this
signification is erroneously given to عَارِضٌ.]) The

the عِضَادَتَانِ. (TA, voce عَتَبَةٌ.) ―
-b3-  A [rafter, or]
single one of the عَوَارِض of a roof: (S, O, K: [but
in some copies of the last, and in the TA, this

also signifies the سَقَائِف [or pieces of wood which
form the roof] of a [vehicle of the kind called]

-A4-  Also, (S, and so in some copies
of the K,) or ↓ عَارِضٌ, (as in other copies of the
K,) or both, (TA,) Hardiness: (S, K, TA:) and
this is what is meant by its being said, in [some
copies of] the K, that عَارِضٌ is also syn. with
عَارِضَةٌ; (TA;) [for in some copies of the K, after
several explanations of العَارِضُ, we find وَالعَارِضَةُ
وَالسِّنُّ الَّتِى فِى عُرْضِ الفَمِ; whereas, in other
copies, the و before السِّنُّ is omitted:] courage;
or courage and energy: (S, K, TA:) power of

(TA;) and of courage, or courage and energy;
and of power of speech: (S:) or of eloquence,

the appearance [or occurrence &c.] of such a thing.
(Msb.) And ذِكْرُ اللّٰهِ إِنَّمَا يَكُونُ فِى مَعْرِضِ التَّعْظِيمِ
The praise and glorification of God is only in the
place [or case] of the appearance, [or of the manifesting,] and of the intending, or purposing, of
magnifying. (Msb.) [And hence, فِى مَعْرِضِ كَذَا
also signifies In the time, or case, or on the occasion, of the appearance, &c., of such a thing. And
In the state, or condition, or manner, which is
indicative of such a thing: thus virtually agreeing
with the phrase فِى مِعْرَضِ كَذَا, q. v. infrà.] ―

(MA.)
-A2-  And Pasturage that renders the cattle
in no need of their being fed with fodder. (TA.)

Presenting itself; or occurring]. (Sh.) And
Anything putting its breadth, or width, [or side,
(as is shown by an explanation of أَعْرَضَ,)] in

-b3-  اِدَّانَ مُعْرِضًا
(occurring in a saying of 'Omar, K, or, as some
relate it, دَانَ مُعْرِضًا, K in art. دين,) means He
bought upon credit, or borrowed, or sought or
demanded a loan, [doing so (TA)] of whomsoever
he could, (AZ, S, A, Mgh, O,) not caring what
might be the consequence: (S, O:) or addressing
himself to any one who came in his way: (Sh, K:)
or turning away from such as said Thou shalt
not buy on credit, or borrow: (IAth:) or avoiding payment: (TA:) or from any quarter that
was easy and practicable to him, without caring,
(O, K,) and without being perplexed: (O:) or
he incurred the debt without caring for not paying
it, or for what might be the consequence: (As:)
or he contracted a debt with every one who presented himself to him: (K in art. دين:) Sh says
that the making معرضا to signify مُمْكِنًا is improbable; because it is in the accus. case as a denotative of state with respect to [the agent implied
in the verb] ادّان; and if you explain it as meaning he took it from him who enabled him, then
معرضا applies to him whom he accosts, for he is
the ممكن; [he suggests also, that the meaning
may be he bought upon credit, or borrowed,
largely; for] he adds that معرضا may be from
أَعْرَضَ ثَوْبُ المَلْبَسِ, signifying اِتَّسَعَ and عَرُضَ.

and a garment in which a girl is shown, or displayed, to the purchaser: (TA:) or the shirt in
which a male slave, and a girl, is shown, displayed,
exposed, or offered for sale. (Har p. 129.) [And
hence, فِى مِعْرَضِ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  In the guise of such a
thing, used tropically, virtually agreeing with the
phrase فِى مَعْرِضِ كَذَا in a sense expl. above.]

cooked: (ISk, S, O, K:) occurring in a verse
(S, O) of Es-Suleyk Ibn-Es-Sulakeh, (O,) as
some relate it; but accord. to others it is with
ص; (S, O;) and this latter is the more correct.
(O.)
-A3-  مُعَرَّضَةٌ A virgin before she is veiled, or

outgone the other camels, so that the crows, or
ravens, alighted upon her, and ate the dates, as

of a boy: (K:) [or] so ↓ مُعْرِضٌ. (O:)

two extremities, and thick in the middle, (O, K,)
being in form like the wooden implement wherewith
cotton is separated from its seeds, or is separated
and loosened [by striking therewith the string of a
bow], (O, TA,) which goes sideways, (Mgh, [in
the O and TA, مُسْتَوِيًا, app. a mistranscription,
for مُسْتَعْرِضًا,]) striking with its عَرْض [or middle
part, unless this be a mistake for عُرْض, or side],
(Mgh, [in my copy of which, عرض is without
any vowel-sign,] and K,) not with its extremity:
(Mgh, K:) sometimes, it strikes with its thick
middle part in such a manner that it breaks and
crushes what it strikes so that it is like the thing
that is beaten to death; and if the object of
the chase be near to it, it strikes it with the
place of the head thereof: if it make a hole,
the game smitten with it may be eaten; but not
if it strike with a middle part (بِعَرْضٍ). (O,
TA.)
-A2-  An oblique, indirect, obscure, ambiguous,
or equivocal, mode of speech; as when thou askest
a man, “Hast thou seen such a one? ” and he,
having seen him, and disliking to lie, answers,
“ Verily such a one is seen: ” (Msb:) from عَرَّضَ
[q. v.]: (Msb, El-Munáwee: the latter in explaining a trad., q. v. infrà:) i. q. تَوْرِيَةٌ [signifying as
above; or the pretending one thing and meaning
another; or the using a word, an expression, or
a phrase, which has an obvious meaning, and intending thereby another meaning to which it applies
but which is contrary to the obvious one]; the
original meaning of which is concealment: (Msb:)
or language whereof one part resembles another in
the meanings: (O, TA: [in the TA immediately
follows the exemplification cited above, from the
Msb; whence it seems that this explanation is
itself somewhat of a معراض, meaning what it
does not clearly express:]) or المَعَارِيضُ فِى الكَلَامِ
[thus, with the pl. form, in two copies of the S,
and in the TA,] signifies التَّوْرِيَةُ بِالشَّىْءِ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ
[the pretending, or making believe, a thing instead
of another thing]: (S:) and مَعَارِضُ الكَلَامِ and
↓ أَعْرَاضُهُ signify the same as مَعَارِيضُهُ. (TA.)
[مَعَارِضُ is a contraction of مَعَارِيضُ, like as مِعْرضٌ
is said to be of مِعْرَاضٌ when syn. therewith.] It
is said in a prov., (S,) a trad., (TA,) إِنَّ فِى
المَعَارِيضِ لَمَنْدُوحَةً عَنِ الكَذِبِ [Verily, in oblique,
indirect, obscure, ambiguous, or equivocal, modes
of speech is ample scope, freedom, or liberty,
(سَعَةٌ, S,) to avoid lying; or, as is said in the L
in art. ندح, that which renders one in no need of
lying]. (S, Msb.) One says also, عَرَفْتُهُ فِى
مِعْرَاضِ كَلَامِهِ, expl. voce عَرُوضٌ which see in
three places, and كَلَامِهِ ↓ فِى مِعْرَضِ, rejecting
the ا: this latter is said by some of the learned to be
a metaphorical expression, from مِعْرَضٌ signifying
the “ garment in which girls are displayed,” as
though the meaning were (tropical:)  [I knew it] in the
form, or manner, and guise, and mould, of his
speech; but this does not obtain in all kinds of
speech; for it may not be said in cases of reviling;
indeed it would be bad, in these cases, to use as
a metaphor the garment of adornment: therefore
the proper way is to say that مِعْرَضٌ is a contraction of مِعْرَاضٌ. (Msb.) One also says الأَلْفَاظُ
مَعَارِيضُ المَعَانِى (tropical:)  [Words are the robes of meanings]: and this phrase also is [said to be] taken
from مِعْرَضٌ signifying the “ garment in which a
girl is displayed; ” because words adorn meanings. (TA.)
مُعَارِضٌ A camel that does not go straightly in
the file, or series, but takes to the right and left:
(A:) or a she camel such as is termed عَلُوق;
that makes a show of affection with her nose [by
smelling her young one], (تَرْأَمُ بِأَنْفِهَا,) and refuses
to yield her milk. (AA, O, K.)
