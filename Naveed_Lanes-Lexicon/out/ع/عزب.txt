عزب1
عَزَبَ, aor.
عَزُبَ (S, O, Msb) and
عَزِبَ, (S, O,) inf. n.
عُزُوبٌ, (S, Msb,) He, (a man, S, O,) or it, (a
thing, Msb,) was, or became, distant, or remote;
(S, O, Msb;) and absent; عَنِّى from me: (S,
O:) or ↓ اعزب has the former meaning: (K:)
and عَزَبَ, aor.
عَزُبَ and
عَزِبَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. as
above, (K,) signifies he, or it, was, or became,
absent, (Msb, K,) and concealed: (Msb:) and
went away, or departed. (K, TA.) You say,
عَزَبَ بِهَا, referring to sheep or goats, He went to
a distance, or far off, with them: so in a trad.:
or, as some relate it, بها ↓ عزّب, meaning he went
with them to a remote pasturage: and he pastured
them (namely, camels,) at a distance from the
place of abode of the tribe, not repairing, or returning, to them [in the evening]: and ↓ تعزّب,
and thus the verb is written in copies of the K
in a place where some copies have يَعْزُبُ, occurs
in the phrase تعزّب عَنْ أَهْلِهِ وَمَالِهِ [He went away
to a distance from his family and his cattle, or
camels &c.]. (TA.) And عَزَبَتِ الإِبِلُ The camels
went away to a distance in the pasturage, not returning in the evening: (S, O:) and in like manner one says of sheep or goats. (O.) And لَا
يَعْزُبُ عَنْ عِلْمِهِ شَىْءٌ Nothing is absent from his
(God's) knowledge. (TA. [See Kur x.62 and
xxxiv. 3.]) And عَزَبَ طُهْرُ المُرْأَةِ [The woman's
state of pureness from the menstrual discharge
was a remote thing] means (assumed tropical:)  the woman's husband
was absent from her: (K:) or [rather] is said
of the woman when her husband is absent from
her. (S, O.) And عَزَبَ عَنْ فُلَانٍ حِلْمُهُ [Such a
one's forbearance quitted him]; (S, O;) as also
↓ اعزب. (O.) ―
-b2-  Also, aor.
عَزُبَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.
عُزْبَةٌ and عُزُوبَةٌ, (Msb, MF, TA,) or these are
simple substs., (S, K,) (assumed tropical:)  He was without a wife;

-b3-  And عَزَبَتِ الأَرْضُ (assumed tropical:)  The land, whether fruitful
or unfruitful, was, or became, destitute of inhabitants; had in it no one. (S, O, K.)

عزّب بِهَا: see 1, second sentence. عُزِّبَ بِهِ
عَنِ الدَّارِ is said of a herd of pasturing camels
[meaning It was taken to pasture at a distance
from the place of abode]. (S, O, K. *) ―
-b2-  It is
said in a trad. (S, O) of the Prophet, (O,) مَنْ قَرَأَ
القُرْآنَ فِى أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً فَقَدْ عَزَّبَ, meaning (tropical:)  [He
who reads, or recites, the Kur-án in forty nights]
goes to a remote period of time from his commencement; (S, O, TA;) or makes the time of the commencement thereof to be remote; (A;) and is
tardy in doing so. (TA.)
-A2-  عزّب إِبِلَهُ: see 4.
―
-b2-  لَيْسَ لِفُلَانٍ امْرَأَةٌ تُعَزِّبُهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  There is not
for such a one a woman to put an end to his
celibacy by marriage, is like the saying هِىَ تُمَرِّضُهُ
“ she takes care of him in his sickness. ” (O,
TA.) ―
-b3-  And one says, فُلَانٌ يُعَزِّبُ فُلَانًا وَيُرْبِضُهُ
(assumed tropical:)  [Such a one undertakes, or manages, the affairs
of such a one, and his expenses]; i. e., acts for
him like a treasurer. (TA, from the Nawádir el-Aaráb. [In art. ربض in the TA, عزّبه is said to
signify, agreeably with the explanation above,
قَامَ عَلَيْهِ.])

اعزب He made to be distant, or remote; or
to go far away. (K, * TA.) You say, اعزبهُ اللّٰهُ
God made him, or may God make him, to go
away, or far away. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  اعزب الإِبِلَ He

إِبِلَهُ and ↓ عزّبها He made his camels to pass the
night in the pasturage, not bringing them back in
the evening. (TA.) And اعزب جَمَلَهُ is like أَضَلَّهُ

-b3-
[Hence,] اعزب اللّٰهُ عَنْهُ حِلْمَهُ (assumed tropical:)  God made his forbearance to become remote from him. (O.) ―
-b4-
And أَعْزَبْنَا الكَلَأَ, (O,) or أَعْزَبْنَا alone, (S,) We

-A2-  As intrans.: see 1, first sentence: and the same in the
latter half. ―

a wife [a long time, or he abstained from marriage a long time; then he took a wife]. (O.)
[See also 1, near the end.]
عَزَبٌ [correctly thus, but in the sense here following written in the TA without any syll. signs,
and in the O written عِزَّبٌ,] A man who goes
away to a distance into the country, or in the
land. (O, TA.) [And One who goes far away
with his camels to pasture: pl. أَعْزَابٌ. (See also
عَزِيبٌ and عَازِبٌ and مُعْزِبٌ and مِعْزَابَةٌ.)] هِرَاوَةُ
الأَعْزَابِ means The staff of those who go far away
with their camels to pasture; and a horse is
likened thereto, (S, O, TA,) on account of its
compactness and smoothness; so in a marginal
note in the L: (TA:) [Sgh, however, says,] thus
in some of the lexicons, but in my opinion, (O,)
it was the name of a mare which was not to be
outstripped, and which was thus called because
her owner gave her gratuitously for the use of
those of his people who had no wives, who made
predatory attacks upon her, and when one of
them acquired for himself property and a wife,
he resigned her to another of his people: (O,
K: *) whence the prov.
أَعَزُّ مِنْ هِرَاوَةِ الأَعْزَابِ
[More highly esteemed than Hiráwet-el-Aazáb].
(O.) See an ex. in a verse cited voce عَدِيدٌ. ―
-b2-
See also عَازِبٌ. ―
-b3-  Also Whatever is alone, solitary, or apart from others. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A
man having no wife; (Ks, S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;)
as also ↓ عَازِبٌ, (Msb, * TA,) which is the original;
(Msb;) and ↓ عَزِيبٌ, and ↓ مِعْزَابَةٌ [which see
below]; (K;) but not ↓ أَعْزَابُ, (Mgh, O, Msb,
K,) this being disallowed by AHát, (O, Msb,)
and others; (TA;) or it is rare; (K;) but it
occurs in a trad.; (Mgh, O;) and some allow
it: (O, Msb:) the pl. of the first is أَعْزَابٌ, (O,
K,) or عُزَّابٌ, (S, * Msb,) which is thus because
the original form of the sing. is considered as
being ↓ عَازِبٌ, this pl. being like كُفَّارٌ as pl. of
كَافِرٌ, (Msb,) or عَزَبٌ has both of these pls., (O,)
or عُزَّابٌ is pl. of ↓ عَازِبٌ, (TA,) and is applied to
men and to (assumed tropical:)  women as meaning having no
spouses: (S, TA:) عَزَبَةٌ is applied to (assumed tropical:)  a woman
[as meaning having no husband], (Ks, S, O, Msb,
K,) and (O, Msb, K) so عَزَبٌ; (Zj, Kz, Mgh,
O, Msb, K;) and if أَعْزَبُ be applied to a man,
↓ عَزْبَآءُ, may by rule be applied to a woman; and
the pl. of عَزَبَةٌ is عَزَبَاتٌ: (Msb:) or, accord. to
Zj, عَزَبَةٌ is a mistake of Abu-l-'Abbás [i. e. Th],
and عَزَبٌ is used as an epithet of a man and of a
woman, like as is خَصْمٌ, and does not assume a
dual form nor a pl. nor a fem. form, because it is
originally an inf. n.; MF, however, denies that
we have any authority for calling عَزَبٌ an inf. n.:
he considers it to be a simple epithet, like حَسَنٌ
&c.; and if used in the fem. sense without the
termination ة otherwise than by poetic license, to
be an anomalous epithet, like عَانِسٌ, which is
applied alike to a man and to a woman: the
phrase رَجُلَانِ عَزَبَانِ is also mentioned: and the
saying إِنَّهُ لَعَزَبٌ لَزَبٌ [in which the latter epithet
is merely an imitative sequent corrobative of the
former], and إِنَّهَا لَعَزَبَةٌ لَزَبَةٌ: and عَزَبٌ is said to
be [also] a quasi-pl. n. [of عَازِبٌ], like as خَدَمٌ is
of خَادِمٌ. (TA.)
عُزْبَةٌ and ↓ عُزُوبَةٌ The state of having no wife
or husband; celibacy. (S, K. [Each said in the
S and K to be a simple subst.: but see 1, near
the end.])
عَزِيبٌ A man who has gone away to a distance
(تَعَزَّبَ, as in some copies of the K), or who goes
away to a distance (يَعْزُبُ, as in other copies of
the K), from his family and his cattle, or camels
&c. (K, TA.) ―
-b2-  And Cattle, or camels &c., at
a distance from the tribe: heard by Az in this
sense from the Arabs: (TA:) or a herd of
camels, and the like of sheep or goats, that go
away to a distance from their owners in the pasturage: (K, TA:) and إِبِلٌ عَزِيبٌ camels that do
not return in the evening to the tribe: عَزِيبٌ
thus used is pl. (or a quasi-pl. n., TA) of ↓ عَازِبٌ,
like as غَزِىٌّ is of غَازٍ. (S, K, TA.) ―
-b3-  See also
عَازِبٌ ―
-b4-  And see عَزَبٌ, near the middle.
عَزُوبَةٌ A land in which one has to go far for
pasturage; (O, K;) in which the pasturage is
little: (TA:) the ة is to render the signification
intensive. (O.)
عُزُوبَةٌ: see عُزْبَةٌ.
عَازِبٌ Distant, or remote: (Msb, TA:) applied
in this sense to herbage: (S, K:) or, applied to
herbage, such as has not been depastured at all,
nor trodden: and, accord. to the A, only such as
is in a desert in which is no seed-produce: (TA:)
and it is likewise applied to meadows (رَوْضٌ)
[app. as meaning distant, or remote]; as also
↓ عَزِيبٌ. (A, TA.) In the following saying,
وَصَدْرٍ أَرَاحَ اللَّيْلُ عَازِبَ هَمِّهِ
تَضَاعَفَ فِيهِ الحُزْنُ مِنْ كُلِّ جَانِبِ
(tropical:)  [In many a bosom whose remote (or long-past)
anxiety night has brought back, grief has multiplied from every quarter], it is used metaphorically. (A.) And [in like manner,] in a trad. of
'Átikeh,
قَهُنَّ هَوَآءٌ وَالحُلُومُ عَوَازِبُ
means (assumed tropical:)  And they are devoid of reason, the intel-lects [being] far away: عَوَازِبُ here being pl. of
عَازِبٌ. (L, TA.) And [in a similar manner,]
عَوَازِبُ الأَطْهَارِ [in which عَوَازِبُ is pl. of عَازِبَةٌ] is
applied as an epithet to women whose husbands are
absent: (S and O and TA, from a verse of En-Ná-
bighah Edh-Dhubyánee: [for the lit. meaning, see
1, latter half:]) ―
-b2-  [for] عَازِبٌ signifies also Absent; and concealed. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  It is also applied
to sheep or goats, (شَآءٌ, O, TA, and غَنَمٌ, O,) and
to camels, (إِبِلٌ, O,) meaning Remote in the pasturage, (O, TA,) that do not return in the evening, (O,) or that do not repair to the place of
alighting and abode [of their owners] in the night:
(TA:) and [in like manner] ↓ عَزَبٌ is applied to
cattle, or camels &c., (مَالٌ, A, O, TA,) meaning
that go away to a distance from their owners.
(O.) See also عَزِيبٌ [which, thus applied, is a
quasi-pl. n. of عَازِبٌ]. And عَازِبَةٌ is likewise applied to camels (O, K) as meaning That go far
away to pasture: (O, K: *) so in the prov. إِنَّمَا
اشْتَرَيْتُ الغَنَمَ حِذَارَ العَازِبَةِ [I only bought the sheep,
or goats, in fear of loosing those that go far away
to pasture]: said by a man who had camels, and
sold them, and bought sheep, or goats, lest they
[the camels] should go far away to pasture; and
his sheep, or goats, did so: (O, K:) it is applied
to the case of him who acts with gentleness [or
precaution] in the easiest of affairs, and has unexpected difficulty, or trouble, inseparable from
him. (O.) ―
-b4-  See also عَزَبٌ, in three places. ―
-b5-
And see مُعَزِّبَةٌ.
عَوْزَبٌ An old woman: (O, K:) so called because of the long period that has elapsed since
her marriage. (TA.)
أَعْزَبُ; and the fem. عَزْبَآءُ: see عَزَبٌ.
مُعْزِبٌ One who goes away from his family with
his camels. (Az, TA.) [See also عَزَبٌ and عَزِيبٌ
&c.] ―
-b2-  And Seeking distant herbage, such as is
termed عَازِبٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And One whose camels
go away to a distance in the pasturage, not to return in the evening. (S, TA.)
مِعْزَبَةٌ A female slave: (O, K:) or, accord. to
Th, applied only to a woman that has not a husband: (TA:) pl. مَعَازِبُ, for which مَعَازِيبُ occurs
in a verse of Aboo-Khirásh El-Hudhalee. (O.) ―
-b2-
See also مُعَزِّبَةٌ.
مُعَزَّبٌ A herd of pasturing camels taken to pasture at a distance (عُزِّبَ بِهِ) from the place of
abode. (S, O, K. *)
مُعَزِّبَةٌ (A, O, K) and ↓ مِعْزَبَةٌ and ↓ عَازِبَةٌ (K)
(tropical:)  A man's wife, (A, O, K,) to whom he resorts,
and who undertakes the preparing of his food and
the taking care of his implements, utensils, accoutrements, or furniture. (O.)
مِعْزَابٌ: see what follows, in two places.
مِعْزَابَةٌ A man who goes away to a distance with
his cattle, or camels &c., (S, A, O, K,) from
others, in the pasturage; (S, O;) as also ↓ مِعْزَابٌ:
(A, O, K:) accord. to Az, the former is the only
epithet of the measure مِفْعَالَةٌ, except مِجْذَامَةٌ,
which is sometimes used; [but in the TA, مِطْرَابَةٌ
and مِطْوَاعَةٌ and مِقْدَامَةٌ also are mentioned;] the
ة in معزابة, he says, is added to give intensiveness
to the signification, and to imply praise; the
meaning being, in his opinion, a man who frequently betakes himself, with his cattle, or camels
&c., pasturing at a distance from others, to the
places where rain has fallen, and to the uncropped
herbage produced thereby; and he adds that the ة
is affixed to a masc. epithet to imply praise or
blame when intensiveness is meant. (TA.) The
two epithets above are also expl. as applied to a
man who pastures his camels at a distance from
the abode of the tribe, not repairing to them to
rest. (TA.) [See also عَزَبٌ &c.] ―
-b2-  Also, (S,
O, K, TA,) or ↓ مِعْزَابٌ, (A, TA,) (tropical:)  A man who
has been long without a wife, (S, A, O, K, TA,)
so that he has no need of one. (TA.) ―
