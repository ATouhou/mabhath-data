عزر1
عَزَرَهُ, aor.
عَزِرَ, inf. n. عَزْرٌ, He prevented, hindered, withheld, or forbade, him; (Mgh, * O, K, *
TA;) and turned him away, or back; (Mgh, *
O, TA;) عَنِ الشَّىْءِ from the thing: this is the
primary signification, from which others, mentioned in the next paragraph, are derived. (TA.)
See 2, in eight places. ―
-b2-  And عَزَرْتُ البَعِيرَ. inf. n.
عَزْرٌ, I tied a cord upon the خَيَاشِيم [app. meaning
the upper parts of the nostrils] of the camel, and
then put medicine into his mouth. (O, TA.) ―
-b3-

عزّرهُ, (O, TA,) inf. n. تَعْزِيرٌ, (S, O, K, TA,)
He disciplined, chastised, corrected, or punished,
him; (S, O, TA;) meaning he did to him that
which should turn him away, or back, from evil,
or foul, conduct. (Ibráheem Es-Seree, O, * TA.)
―
-b2-  And hence, (S,) He inflicted upon him a
beating, or flogging, less than that prescribed by
the law; (S, M, Mgh, * O, Msb, * K;) as also
↓ عَزَرَهُ, inf. n. عَزْرٌ: (TA: but only the inf. n. of
the latter verb in this sense is there mentioned:)
because it prevents the criminal from returning
to disobedience: but whether this meaning belong
only to the conventional language of the law or
be implied in the proper signification, is disputed:
(TA:) or he beat, or flogged, him with the utmost
vehemence: (M, K:) or تَعْزِيرٌ signifies [simply]
the act of beating. (A.) And one says, ضَرَبَهُ
تَعْزِيرًا, meaning He beat him moderately; not
exceeding the ordinary bounds. (TA in art. حل.)
―
-b3-  Also He constrained him against his will, عَلَى
الأَمْرِ to do the thing, (O, K, *) and taught him by
forbidding him to return to the doing of that which
was at variance therewith; and so ↓ عَزَرَهُ: (IAar,
O:) and he taught him the فَرَائِض and أَحْكَام [or
obligatory statutes or ordinances of God]; (O;)
or التَّعْزِيرُ, (Az, L,) or ↓ العَزْرُ, (K,) signifies the
teaching [one] (Az, L, K) religion, (Az, L,) or
بَاب الدِّين [i. e. the declaration of belief in the
unity of God and in the mission of Mohammad]
and the فَرَائِض and أَحْكَام. (L, K.) ―
-b4-  And He
blamed, censured, or reproved, him; as also ↓ عَزَرَهُ,
aor.
عَزِرَ, inf. n. عَزْرٌ. (K.) ―
-b5-  And He aided, or
assisted, him; as also ↓ عَزَرَهُ, inf. n. as above:
(K, * TA:) and he strengthened him; (K, * TA;)
and so ↓ عَزَرَهُ, inf. n. as above. (TA.) He aided
him against his enemy, or enemies, by repelling the
latter; (O, TA;) as also ↓ عَزَرَهُ, aor.
عَزِرَ and
عَزُرَ,
but the former is the more chaste, inf. n. as
above: (O:) or he did so time after time: or
with the sword. (O, TA.) ―
-b6-  And He treated
him with reverence, veneration, respect, or honour;
(S, A, O, Msb, K;) and so ↓ عَزَرَهُ, aor.
عَزِرَ and
