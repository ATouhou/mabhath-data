AZ respecting ↓ عُرَاقٌ: (TA:) but accord. to
A'Obeyd, this signifies a piece of flesh-meat; and
IAmb says that this is the right explanation, because the Arabs say أَكَلْتُ العُرَاقَ, and they do
not say أَكَلْتُ العَظْمَ: (Har p.26:) [or, app.,
the flesh-meat of a bone: and likewise the portions, of trees, that are cropped by camels: (see
عُرَامٌ:)] the pl. (of عَرْقٌ, S, Mgh, O) is ↓ عُرَاقٌ,

of a measure of which, as that of a pl., there are
few instances, (ISk, S, O,) [see an ex. voce
جَنَاحٌ,] and عِرَاقٌ, also, (IAar, K,) which is more
agreeable with analogy. (IAar, TA.) ―

that land: (S, Mgh, O, Msb:) the epithet being
tropically applied to the عِرْق, (Mgh, Msb,) as it
properly applies to the owner thereof: (Mgh:)

by force. (O, TA. [In the S, the former hemistich of this verse is given differently, and, as is
said in the TA, erroneously.]) ―
-b7-  لَقِيتُ مِنْ فُلَانٍ
عَرَقَ القِرْبَةِ (which is a prov., TA) means [I experienced from such a one] hardship, as expl. by
As, who says that he knew not the origin thereof,
(S, O,) or difficulty, or distress, as expl. by IDrd:
(O:) and it is said that the عَرَق [or sweat] is of
the man, not of the قِرْبَة [or water-skin]; and the
origin of the saying is, that water-skins (قِرَب) are
[generally] carried only by female slaves that
bear burdens, and by him who has no assistant;
but sometimes a man of generous origin becomes
poor, and in need of carrying them himself, and
he sweats by reason of the trouble that comes upon
him, and of shame; (S, O;) wherefore one says,
تَجَشَّمْتُ لَكَ عَرَقَ القِرْبَةِ [expl. in art. جشم], (S,)
or جَشِمْتُ إِلَيْكَ عَرَقَ القِرْبَةِ [likewise expl. in art.
جشم]: accord. to Ks, the meaning is, I have
suffered fatigue, and imposed upon myself difficulty, for thee, [or in coming to thee,] so that I
have sweated like the sweating of the water-skin:
or, accord. to A'Obeyd, I have imposed upon
myself, in coming to thee, what no one has attained, and what will not be; because the قربة
does not sweat: (O:) عَرَقُ القِرْبَةِ is a metonymical
expression for hardship, and difficulty, or distress;
because, when the قربة sweats, its odour becomes
foul: or because it has no sweat; therefore it is
as though one imposed upon himself an impossible thing: or it means the benefit of the قربة;
(which is the flowing of its water, TA;) as though
one imposed upon himself such a task that he became in need of the water of the قربة, i. e. of
journeying to it; or it means a سَفِيفَة [or plaited
suspensory] which the carrier of the قربة puts over
his chest [when carrying the قربة on his back]:
(K:) accord. to IAar, it signifies the suspensory
(مِعْلَاق) by means of which the قربة is carried;
as also عَلَقُهَا; (O, TA;) the ر being substituted
for ل: (TA: see art. ر:]) but he says also that
عَرَقُ القِرْبَةِ means one's sweating with the قربة by
reason of the difficulty, or trouble, of carrying
it; and عَلَقُهَا, that by which it is tied, or bound,
and then suspended: (L, TA:) the former is also
said to signify the ↓ عِرَاق [q. v.] of the قربة, that
is sewed around it: (TA:) or it means that one
has imposed upon himself difficulty, or trouble,
or fatigue, like that of the carrier of the قربة, who
sweats beneath it by reason of its heaviness. (K.)
―
-b8-  عَرَقٌ also signifies A heat; i. e. a single run,
or a run at once, to a goal, or limit. (S, O, K.)
One says, جَرَى الفَرَسُ عَرَقًا or عَرَقَيْنِ The horse
ran a heat or two heats. (S, O.)

of horses, and of birds, (S, O, Msb, K,) and the

latter is the n. un. [app. signifying one of such
as compose a row]: (S:) pl. أَعْرَاقٌ and عَرَقَاتٌ.

art. صدر, conj. 5; also cited in the present

builder built a row of bricks and two rows thereof]:
(K, TA:) pl. أَعْرَاقٌ. (TA.) ―

[And they had woven in the desert, or waterless
desert, foot-marks in their following one another].
(TA.) ―
-b5-  And A plait of palm-leaves (S, O, Msb,
K) &c. (S, O) before a زَبِيل [so in the S and O]
or زِنْبِيل [so in the K, both meaning the same,
i. e. a basket,] is made therewith: (S, O, K:) or
a زِنْبِيل itself: (K:) or hence (S, O) it signifies
also (S, O, Msb) a زَبِيل (S, O) or [what is called]
a مِكْتَل (Mgh, Msb) and زِنْبِيل, (Msb,) of large
size, woven of palm-leaves, (Mgh,) capable of
containing fifteen times as much as the measure
termed ضاع, as some say, (Mgh, Msb,) or thirty
times as much as that measure: (Mgh:) also pronounced ↓ عَرْقٌ. (K.) ―

―
-b7-  See also عَرَقَةٌ.

is said in the TA to be extr.: and I think it to

lexicon in which زِبَيب has been erroneously
written for زِبَيل.])
لَبَنٌ عَرِقٌ Milk of which the flavour is corrupted
by the sweat of the camel upon which it is borne;
(S, O, K;) the skin containing it being bound
upon him without any preservative between it and

عُرُقٌ a pl. of عِرَاقٌ [q. v.]. (Lth, AZ, S, &c.)

one beats, or flogs. (K.) ―
-b5-  And The plaited
thong with which a captive is bound: pl. عَرَقَاتٌ

عُرَقَةٌ, (S, O, K,) which is agreeable with general analogy, and ↓ عُرَقٌ, (K, TA,) which is not
so, but which is used by some in the same sense
as the former, (TA,) A man who sweats much,
(S, O, K, TA.)
عَرْقٍ, originally عَرْقُوٌ: see عَرْقُوَةٌ, of which it is a
coll. gen. n.

thin skin in the egg of an ostrich, is evidently a
mistake for غِرْقِئٌ.]

-A2-  and the paragraph here
following, in two places:

root, race, stock, or source; syn. أَصْلٌ: (O, K:)
or a source of wealth or property: or the main
portion of the root of a tree. from which the عُرُوق
[or minor roots] branch off: (K:) or, as some
say, عِرْقَاةٌ has this last meaning; or, as others
say, ↓ عِرْقَةٌ. (Ltl., O.) They said, اِسْتَأْصَلَ اللّٰهُ
↓ عَرْقَاتَهُمْ and عِرْقَاتِهِمْ; if they pronounced the
first letter with fet-h, they so pronounced the last
letter [before the pronoun]; and if they pronounced the former with kesr, they thus pronounced the latter, regarding the word as pl. of
↓ عِرْقَةٌ: (K:) or, accord. to Lth, the Arabs are
related to have said, اِسْتَأْصَلَ اللّٰهُ عِرْقَاتَهُمْ, meaning
شَأْفَتَهُمْ [i. e. May God utterly destroy their race,
stock, or family], pronouncing the ت with nasb
because regarding the word as [a sing.] like
سِعْلَاةٌ; or holding it to be pl. of ↓ عِرْقَةٌ, but pronouncing the تَ thus like as they do in saying
رَأَيْتُ بَنَاتَكَ: it is said, however, that this is a
mistake; that only he should pronounce it thus
who makes the word to be a sing. like سِعْلَاةٌ.
(O.) [The saying is a prov., mentioned by
Meyd, who adds another reading, namely, عَرَقَاتهم,
holding this to be from ↓ العَرَقَةُ meaning “ the طُرَّة
that is woven around the فُسْطَاط: ” and Freytag,
in his Lexicon, adds also عَرِقاتَه, with nasb, as on
the authority of Meyd; in whose “ Proverbs ” I
do not find it.]
عَرْقَان [accord. to general analogy without tenween and having for its fem. عَرْقَى, or accord. to
the dial. of the Benoo-Asad with tenween and
having for its fem. عَرْقَانَةٌ,] Sweating. (Msb.)
عَرْقُوَةُ الدَّلْوِ is thus, (S, O, K,) with fet-h to the
ع, (S, O,) like تَرْقُوَة, (K,) and should not be pronounced with damm to the first letter; (S, O, K;)

opposite part]: (TA:) the عَرْقُوَتَانِ being the two
pieces of wood that are put athwart the دلو [to
keep it from collapsing and for the purpose of
attaching thereto the well-rope], like a cross:
(As, S, O, K:) pl. عَرَاقٍ; (S, O, K;) and if you
pluralize it by suppressing the ة [of the sing., or
rather if you form from it a coll. gen. n.], you
say ↓ عَرْقٍ, originally عَرْقُوٌ, (S, O, L,) then عَرْقِىٌ,
and then عَرْقٍ. (L.) ―
-b2-  العَرْقُوَتَانِ also signifies
The two pieces of wood that connect the وَاسِط
[or fore part] of the [camel's saddle called] رَحْل

[camel's saddle called] قَتَب. (O.) ―
-b3-  ذَاتُ العَرَاقِى
means (assumed tropical:)  Calamity, or misfortune: (S, O, K, TA:)
for it is [properly] the دَلْو [or leathern bucket];

says, لَقِيتُ مِنْهُ ذَاتَ العَرَاقِى [I experienced from
it, or him, calamity]: (TA:) or, as some say, it
is from what here follows. (S, O, TA.) ―

الإِكَامِ signifies Such [eminences of the kind called

heap over a grave, (Lth, O, K,) elongated: (Lth,
O:) an أَكَمَة that extends, not high, but overtopping what is around it, near to the ground or
not near, and varying in different parts so that
one place thereof is soft and another place thereof
rugged; being only a level portion of the earth
overtopping what is around it: (ISh, TA:) and

[thereon thus] doubled: (Msb:) or, accord. to
