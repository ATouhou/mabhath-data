عبى2
عَبَّيْتُ الجَيْشَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. تَعْبِيَةٌ (S, K)
and تَعْبِئَةٌ and تَعْبِىْءٌ, so said Yoo; but AZ said
عَبَّأْتُهُ; (S; [see art. عبأ;]) I prepared, or made
ready, (S, K, *) or set in order, disposed, or
arranged, (Msb,) the army (S, Msb, K) in their
places. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  See also 2 in art. عبو.

الاِعْتِبَآءُ, mentioned here in the TA, as syn.
with الاِحْتِشَآءُ, see 8 in art. عبأ.
عَبًا and ↓ عَبَايَةٌ, but the former the more chaste,
are said to signify, as epithets applied to a man,
Coarse, or rude, heavy, dull, or stupid, (K, * TA,)
and impotent: but this requires correction; for
Lth mentions العَبَا, and ↓ العَبَآءُ as used by a
poet, and says that they signify the coarse, or
rude, impotent, man; but Az says that he had
not heard العَبَآء in this sense on any authority
other than that of Lth, and that he held the right
reading in the verse cited as an ex. by Lth to be
العَيَآء, with ى, meaning, as also العَيَايَآء, “the
coarse, or rude, or the heavy, dull, or stupid, and
impotent, who has no need of women. ” (TA.)
عَبَآءٌ: see عَبَايَةٌ, in two places.
-A2-  And see also
عَبًا, above.
عباة [app. عَبَاةٌ] The [kind of plant called]
سُطَّاح that spreads upon the ground. (TA.)
عَبِىٌّ One's share of the جَزُور [or slaughtered
camel for portions of which the players at the
game called المَيْسِر contend]. (K, TA.)
عَبَايَةٌ and عَبَآءَةٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA) A sort
of [the kind of garments called] أَكْسِيَة [pl. of
كِسَآء], (S, Mgh, * K, TA,) wide, (Mgh, TA,)
and [generally] having in it large black [or
brown] stripes: (TA:) pl. [of the latter] عَبَاآتٌ
(S, Msb) and ↓ عَبَآءٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) formed by the
elision of the ة, (Msb,) [or rather this is a coll.
gen. n.,] and the pl. of عَبَايَةٌ is عُبِىٌّ, like عُتِىٌّ:
or, accord. to some, ↓ عَبَآءٌ is a sing.; for they
say that it signifies a sort of أَكْسِيَة, and that its
pl. is أَعْبِيَةٌ. (TA.) See عَبَآءَةٌ in art. عبأ.
-A2-  See
also عَبًأ, above.
