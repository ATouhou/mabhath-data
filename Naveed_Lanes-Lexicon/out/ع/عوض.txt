عَاضَهُ, (S, A, O, Msb, K,) first pers. عُضْتُهُ,
(A and TA in art. عرض,) aor. يَعُوضُ, (Msb,)
inf. n. عَوْضٌ (A, O, Msb, K) and عِوَضٌ (O, K)
and عِيَاضٌ, (A, O, K,) originally عِوَاضٌ, (O, K,)
He (God, A, O, K, or a man, S, O, Msb) gave
him a substitute, or something instead or in exchange, or a compensation, (S, A, * O, Msb, K, *)
عَنْ كَذَا [for such a thing], (Msb,) or مِنْهُ [for
it]; (O, K;) or عَاضَهُ مَا أُخِذَ مِنْهُ, said of God,
[and of a man,] He gave him a substitute for, or
replaced to him, what had been taken from him;
(A;) and ↓ عوّضهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَعْوِيضٌ,
(TA,) signifies the same; (S, A, Msb, K;) as
also ↓ اعاضهُ; (S, IJ, Msb;) and ↓ عاوضهُ, (S, O,
K,) inf. n. مُعَاوَضَةٌ. (TA.) ―

اعتاض He took, or received, a substitute, or

[both of which also signify he had a thing replaced to him:] and ↓ عِضْتُ, [originally عَوِضْتُ,]
(Lth and TA, in this art. and in art. عرض,) aor.
أَعَاضُ, (TA in art. عرض,) likewise signifies I
took, or received, a substitute, or something instead
or in exchange, or a compensation: (Lth, TA:)
but Az says, “I have not heard this on any other
authority than that of Lth. ” (O, TA.) You say
also, اِعْتَاضَ خَيْرًا مِمَّا ذَهَبَ مِنْهُ [He received as a
substitute, or compensation, what was better than
that which had gone from him]; and [in like
manner] ↓ تَعَوَّضَ. (A.)
-A2-  اعتاضهُ He came to
him seeking, or demanding, a substitute, or something instead or in exchange, or a compensation;
(O, K;) and a free gift, or gratuity. (O, TA.)
[See also 10.]

thing) as a substitute, or in exchange, for another
thing; or in the place of another thing; syn.
اِسْتَخْلَفَهُ [q. v.]. (TA in art. خلف.)
عَوْضُ and عَوْضَ (Az, S, O, Mughnee, K) and
عَوْضِ; (Mughnee, K,) the first accord. to Ks
(TA) and the Koofees, and the second accord. to
the Basrees; (O, TA; [in which latter it is added
that the second is the most common; but this I
think a mistake; for I have most frequently
found the first; and in the Mughnee, عَوْضُ is
mentioned first, as in the S and K, and عَوْضَ
last;]) indecl., (Mughnee, K,) like قَبْلُ and أَيْنَ
and أَمْسِ, (Mughnee,) without tenween; (S;)
[but not always, as will be seen below;] an
adv. n., (Mughnee, K,) denoting future time, (S,
O,) or all future time, (Mughnee, K,) like as قَطُّ
denotes past time; (S, O;) meaning Ever; syn.
أَبَدًا; (S, * O, K;) but differing from أبَدًا by being
appropriated to negative phrases only: (Mughnee, K: *) you say لَا أُفِارِقُكَ عَوْضُ, (K,) or عَوْضُ
لَا أُفَارِقُكَ, meaning I will not separate myself from
thee, ever; like as you say قَطُّ مَا فَارَقْتُكَ; but you
may not say عَوْضُ مَا فَارَقْتُكَ, like as you may not
say قَطُّ مَا أُفَارِقُكَ: (S, O:) or it denotes past time
also, having the same meaning: for you say, مَا
رَأَيْتُ مِثْلَهُ عَوْضُ, (AZ, K,) meaning I have not
seen the like of him, or it, ever: (AZ:) so in the
two books [the O and the TS] of Sgh: and in
like manner a poet says,
فَلَمْ أَرَ عَامًا عَوْضُ أَكْثَرَ هَالِكًا
[And I have not seen a year, ever, more destructive]. (TA.) But it is decl. when prefixed to
another noun; as in the saying, لَا أفْعَلُهُ عَوْضَ
↓ العَائِضِينَ (Mughnee, K) I will not do it, ever;
(TA;) and ↓ لَا آتِيكَ عَوْضَ العَائِضِينَ [I will not
come to thee, ever]; like as one says, دَهْرَ الدَّاهِرِينَ:
(S, O:) [for in this case you may not say عَوْضُ.]
And one also says افعل ذَاكَ مِنْ ذِى عَوْضٍ, [in
which the first word is written in some copies of
the S and K اِفْعَلْ, and in others أَفْعَلُ,] like as
one says, مِنْ ذِى أُنُفٍ, (S, O, K,) and مِنْ ذِى
قَبَلٍ, (S, O,) meaning [Do thou, or I will do,
that] in what is [now] to be begun [of time;
meaning, immediately: see أُنُفٌ]: (S, O, K:)
[thus making عوض decl., and using it without
a negative, which must always accompany it
when it is indecl.] [See also عِوَضٌ.] Or عَوْضُ
signifies Time; syn. الدَّهْرُ (K) and الزَّمَانُ; (TA;)
which is thus called because, as often as a portion thereof passes, it substitutes for it another
portion: (Mughnee, K:) or, as some say, because
they assert that it despoils and gives compensation. (Mughnee.) [See an ex. in the Ham p. 271,
where it occurs in this sense with tenween, in the
printed text, though said in the commentary to be
indecl., with fet-h or with damm.] Or it is an
oath; (Ibn-El-Kelbee, Mughnee, K,) and is (so
in the O and Mughnee, but in the K “ or ”) the
name of A certain idol, belonging to Bekr Ibn-Wáïl: (S, Mughnee, O, K:) as in a verse cited
in art. مور: (O, Mughnee:) but if so, there is no
reason for its being used indeclinably in a verse of
El-Aashà cited voce أَسْحَمُ [q. v.]: (Mughnee:)
or it is a word used in the manner of an oath; a
man saying to his companion, عَوْضُ لَا يَكُونُ ذٰلِكَ
أَبَدًا [as though meaning Nay, that will not, or
shall not, be, ever]: for if it were a noun signifying time, it would be with tenween; but it is a
particle by which is meant an oath, like أَجَلْ and
نَعَمْ. (Lth, O.)
عِوَضٌ A substitute; a thing given, or received,
or put, or done, instead of, in place of, in lieu of,
or in exchange for, another thing; a compensation; a thing given, or received, by way of replacement; (O;) syn. بَدَلٌ; (M, Msb;) or خَلَفٌ:
(A, K:) pl. أَعْوَاضٌ. (S, Msb.) See also مَعُوضَةٌ.
[Hence, عِوَضًا عَنْهُ As a substitute for it; instead
of, in the place of, or in exchange for, it; as a
compensation for it; &c.]
-A2-  مِنْ ذِى عِوَضٍ i. q.
من ذى عَوْضٍ. (TA in art. قبل.)
العُوَيْضَان, in the dim. form, [but whether in
the sing. or dual form is not shown,] The penis
of a man: of the dial. of El-Yemen. (TA.)
عَائِضٌ in the saying of Aboo-Mohammad ElFak'asee, (K,) i. e. (TA) in the following saying,
هَلْ لَكِ وَالعَارِضُ مِنْكِ عَائِضُ
فِى هَجْمَةٍ يُغْدِرُ مِنْهَا القَابِضُ
(S, O, TA, in this art. and in art. عرض,) is of the
measure فَاعِلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ,
like [the epithet in the phrase] عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ, (S,
O, K,) meaning مَرْضِيَّةٌ: (S, O:) As says that
the poet is addressing a woman whom he is desirous of marrying, saying, Art thou in want,
(and the gift appearing from thee shall have an
exchange made for it to thee by me) of a hundred
camels which I will assign to thee as a dowry,
some whereof the [quick] driver will abandon, not
being able to collect them together because of
their large number? (S in art. عرض: [and the
like is said in the O, as on the authority of Lth:
but I have made a transposition in the explanation, directed in the TA, to make it agree with
the order of the words of the verse:]) or the
meaning is, and the giver of a thing in exchange
for the enjoyment of thee receiveth an exchange
from thee by marriage which is equal to that
which he giveth in exchange for thee; عائض
being from عِضْتُ, not from عُضْتُ: [so that, accord. to this explanation, it is used in the sense
of its own proper measure, فَاعِلٌ:] but IB says
that the phrase, in his poetry, is وَالعائِضُ مِنْكِ
عَائِضُ, meaning the thing given in exchange by
thee will be [indeed] a substitute, or a compensation; like as you say الهِبَةُ مِنْكَ هِبَةٌ: (TA in art.
عرض:) the verse is also related differently, with
مِائَةٍ in the place of هَجْمَةٍ, and يُسْئِرُ in the place
of يُغْدِرُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also عَوْضُ, in two places.
مَعُوضَةٌ, (S, O, K,) like مَعُونَةٌ, (O, TA,) a
subst. from عَاضَهُ; (S, O, K;) [i. e. as expl. in
the TK, meaning خَلَفٌ and بَدَلٌ;] as also
↓ عِوَضٌ. (O, K.)
