عطش1
عَطِشَ, aor.
عَطَشَ, inf. n. عَطَشٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,)
and sometimes مَعْطَشٌ, (TA,) He thirsted; was
thirsty: was in want of drink; and it was in
want of irrigation: عَطَشٌ being the contr. of
رِىٌّ. (S, O, TA.) ―
-b2-  عَطِشَ إِلَى لِقَائِهِ (tropical:)  He longed,
or desired, [lit. thirsted,] to meet with him: like
as they say ظَمِئَ. (IDrd, O.) And أَنَا شَدِيدُ
العَطَشِ إِلَى لِقَائِكَ (tropical:)  [I am vehemently longing, or
desiring, to meet with thee]. (A.) [See also the
first paragraph of art. عمى.]
-A2-  عَاطَشَهُ فَعَطَشَهُ:
see 3.
2
عَطَّشَ see 4.
3
عَاطَشَهُ فَعَطَشَهُ [aor. of the latter, accord. to
general rule,
عَطُشَ, He vied with him in endeavouring to satisfy, (see 6,) or in bearing, thirst, and
surpassed him therein]. (O, K, TA. [But whether
sanctioned by usage, seems to be doubtful.])
4
اعطش His camels, or cattle, thirsted. (T,
S, M, O, K.)
-A2-  اعطش فُلَانًا He made such a
one to thirst. (O, * K, * TA.) ―
-b2-  اعطش الإِبِلَ He
increased the intervals between the two drinkings,
or waterings, of the camels, and withheld them
from coming to the water, (O, K,) or from the
water on the day of their coming thereto: (TA:)
and ↓ عطّشها, [in like manner,] he increased their
thirsting: (A:) or the latter, of which the inf. n.
is تَعْطِيشٌ, has a more intensive signification than
the former verb: (O, K, TA:) or it signifies he
kept them thirsty; i. e., did not water them at all;
or, watered them little, so that they were not
satisfied: (TA, voce ثَأْثَأَ:) when a man has been
accustomed to bring his camels to water on the
third day, or the fourth, and waters them one day
beyond that, you say أَعْطَشَهَا. (TA.)
5
تعطّش He constrained himself to thirst;
syn. تَكَلَّفَ العَطَشَ. (O, K.)
6
تَعَاطَشَا [app. They vied, each with the other,
in endeavouring to satisfy their thirst, (see K,
voce تَجَاشَعَا,) or in bearing thirst].
عَطُشٌ; fem. with ة: see the next paragraph,
in three places.
عَطِشٌ (Mgh, O, Msb, K) and ↓ عَطُشٌ (K) and
↓ عَطْشَان [without and with tenween, as is shown
by the two forms of its fem., which see in what
follows,] (S, Mgh, O, Msb) and ↓ عَاطِشٌ (TA)
Thirsting; or thirsty: (S, TA:) or needing water:
(Mgh:) or you say, الْآنَ ↓ هُوَ عَطْشَانُ [He is
thirsting, or thirsty, now]; (Lh, K;) and هُوَ
غَدًا ↓ عَاطِشٌ [He will be thirsting, or thirsty, tomorrow]; (Lh, O, K;) and بَعْدَ ↓ مَا هُوَ بِعَاطِشٍ
هٰذَا اليَوْمِ [He will not be thirsting, or thirsty,
after this day]: (Lh, TA:) fem. [of the first]
عَطِشَةٌ (O, Msb, K) and [of the second] ↓ عَطُشَةٌ
(TA) and [of the third] ↓ عَطْشَى, (S, O, Msb,
K,) which is also used as a pl., (S, K,) and
↓ عَطْشَانَةٌ: (Lth, O, K:) pl. masc. [of the first
and third and fourth, and perhaps of the second
also,] عِطَاشٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and عُطَاشٌ [which
is irregular] and عَطِشُونَ and [of the second]
عَطُشُونَ (TA) and [of the third] عَطَاشَى: (S, O,
K:) pl. fem. عِطَاشٌ, like the masc., (S, O, K,)
and [of the first] عَطِشَاتٌ, (Lth, O, K,) but this
was ignored by Aboo-Leylà, (O,) and [of the
second] عَطُشَاتٌ (TA) and [of the third] عَطْشَانَاتٌ.
(Lth, O, K.) Accord. to Mohammad Ibn-EsSeree, ↓ عَطْشَان is originally عَطْشَآءُ, like صَحْرَآءُ,
the ن being substituted for the fem. ا, as is shown
by its plural's being عَطَاشَى like صَحَارَى: (S,
O:) [but there are many similar pls. of epithets
of the measure فُعْلَان; as سَكَارَى and غَيَارَى and
نَدَامَى and كَسَالَى &c.] You say also عَطْشَانُ
نَطْشَانُ; the latter being an imitative sequent to
the former, not used alone. (S, O.) And إِنَّكَ
كَأَنَّكَ عَطْشَانُ ↓ إِلَى الدَّمِ عَطْشَانُ [Verily thou art
thirsting for blood, as though thou wert 'Atshán]:
(A:) this being the name of a sword of 'Abd-ElMuttalib Ibn-Háshim. (A, O, K.) The dim. of
عَطِشٌ is ↓ عُطَيْشَان, as though from عَطْشَان; and
↓ عُطَيْشٌ also; but the former is the better. (ISk,
O.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] ↓ عَطْشَان also signifies (tropical:)  Longing; or desiring. (K.) You say, إِنِّى إِلَيْكَ
↓ لَعَطْشَانُ (tropical:)  [Verily I am longing for seeing thee].
(IAar, O.) ―
-b3-  مَكَانٌ عَطِشٌ (S, O, Msb) and
↓ عَطُشٌ (S, O) A place in which is little water:
(S, O, Msb:) or in which is no water. (Msb.)
―
-b4-  الوِشَاحِ ↓ فُلَانَةُ عَطْشَى (A) or عَطِشَةُ الوِشَاحِ
(TA) (tropical:)  [Such a woman is slender in the waist;
or in the belly and flanks; like غَرْثَى الوِشَاحِ].

عُطَاشٌ [Insatiable thirst;] a certain disease,
(S, O, K, TA,) that attacks a man, (S, O, TA,)
