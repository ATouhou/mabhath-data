عَمِلَ, aor.
عَمَلَ, inf. n. عَمَلٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,)
He worked, or wrought; laboured; served, or
did service: he did, acted, or performed: (K,
TA:) [generally, he did, &c., with a sort of difficulty, or with intention; but sometimes said of
an inanimate thing: (see عَمَلٌ, below:)] he did,
or he made, wrought, manufactured, or constructed, a thing. (Msb. [See, again, عَمَلٌ,
below.]) Accord. to Az, عَمِلَ is the only trans.
verb of its measure having the inf. n. of the
measure فَعَلٌ, except هَبِلَت, said of a mother,
inf. n. هَبَلٌ; other similar verbs having the
inf. n. of the measure فَعْلٌ; as سَرِطْتُ اللُّقْمَةَ,
inf. n. سَرْطٌ; and بَلِعْتُهُ, inf. n. بَلْعٌ. (TA. [But
see arts. سرط and بلع; with respect to the former
of which I must here state that, since it was
printed, I have found an authority for سَرْطٌ as
inf. n. of سَرِطَ in a copy of the S; though in the
K it is said to be مُحَرَّكَة, and accord. to the Msb
it is like تَعَبٌ.]) You say, عَمِلْتُ عَلَى الصَّدَقَةِ I
officiated in the collecting of the poor-rate. (Msb.)
[And عَمِلَ بِمَا فِى كِتَابِ اللّٰهِ He did according to
what is enjoined in the Book of God.] And
عَمِلَ فِى هَلَاكِهِ [He laboured to destroy him, or
to kill him]. (K in art. شيط.) [And عَمِلَ فِيهِ
It acted upon him, or it: and, said of a sword
&c., it had effect, or made an impression, upon
him, or it.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,] عَمِلَ فِيهِ signifies [also
(assumed tropical:)  It governed it syntactically; or caused it to be
مَرْفُوع or مَنْصُوب or مَجْرُور &c.; i. e.] it produced
in it a certain species of syntactical desinence.
(K.) ―
-b3-  And عَمِلَ البَرْقُ The lightning was continual. (K.) And عَمِلَتْ بِأُذُنَيْهَا, said of a she-camel, (K,) and also, in a trad., of [the beast]
البُرَاق, (O, * TA,) She went quickly, or swiftly;
(O, K, TA;) because she that does thus puts her
ears in motion by reason of the vehemence of the
pace. (TA.) And عَمِلَت [alone] said of a she-camel, signifies [the same: or] She was, or became, brisk, light, active, or quick. (K.) ―
-b4-  And
[hence, app.,] لَمْ أَرَ النَّفَقَةَ تَعْمَلُ كَمَا تَعْمَلُ بِمَكَّةَ, a
saying mentioned by Lh, is expl. by ISd as
meaning تَنْفَقُ [i. e. I have not seen the money that
that one expends pass away as it passes away in
Mekkeh]. (TA.)

And عُمِّلَ فُلَانٌ عَلَيْهِمْ, inf. n. as above, Such a
one was made, or appointed, governor over them.
(K, TA.) And one says, مَنَ الَّذِى عُمِّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ
Who is he that has been set up as governor over
you? (TA.) And فُلَانٌ ↓ اُسْتُعْمِلَ [Such a one
was employed as governor over a people: (see a
saying of 'Omar in art. ضعف, conj. 2:) or] such
a one was appointed to one of the sovereign's offices
of government. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And عمّلهُ, (Mgh, O,

saying, عاملهُ مُعَامَلَةَ اللَّيْثِ (mentioned in the S

the manner of the lion.] ―
-b2-  And i. q. سَامَهُ بِعَمَلٍ
[He made to him an offer of working, mentioning
the rate of payment; or bargained, or contracted,
with him for work]. (K.) Sgh says that المُعَامَلَةُ
in the language of the people of El-'Irák is what
is termed in the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz
المُسَاقَاةُ, (Msb,) which is The employing a man to

watering &c.] of palm-trees or grape-vines [or the
like] on the condition of his having a certain share
of their produce. (S and TA in art. سقى.)

says also, يُعْمِلُ نَفْسَهُ فِى الأَمْرِ [He plies himself
in the affair]. (S in art. عسم.) ―
-b2-  And [hence,]
He worked with it, [i. e. employed it, or used it,
or plied it,] namely, his judgment, or opinion,

that are used for riding] shall not be hastened nor

اعتمل signifies اِضْطَرَبَ فِى العَمَلِ [He went

Msb, * TA,) for him. (TA.) [And استعمل, app.
for استعمل نَفْسَهُ, He desired to act: see an ex.
in art. روى conj. 2.] ―
-b2-  See also 4, in two places.
―
-b3-  And see 2. One says also, اُسْتُعْمِلَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى
الجَالَّةِ [Such a one was employed as collecter of
the poll-tax]. (S and Msb in art. جل. See also
a similar ex. voce ضِحٌّ.) And اِسْتَعْمَلْتُ الثَّوْبَ I
made the garment to serve [i. e. made use of it]
for clothing. (Msb.) And اِسْتَعْمَلْتُ اللَّبِنَ [I

[He feigned heedlessness, &c.; or made use of it

عَمَلٌ [mentioned in the beginning of this art.
as an inf. n.] is syn. with مَِهْنَةٌ and فِعْلٌ: (K:)
[accordingly, when used as a simple subst., it
may be rendered Work, labour, or service: and
a deed, or an action:] or it has a more particular
meaning than فِعْلٌ; for it is a فِعْل [or deed] with
a sort of difficulty; and therefore it is not attributed to God: or, accord. to Er-Rághib, it is
any فِعْل [i. e. deed or action] that proceeds from
an animate being by his intention; and thus it
has a more particular meaning than فِعْلٌ; for the
فعل is sometimes attributed to animate beings
from which it proceeds without intention; and
sometimes to inanimate things, to which the عَمَل
is seldom attributed; and this is not used in relation to [irrational] animals except [as implied] in
the phrases إِبِلٌ عَوَامِلُ and بَقَرٌ عَوَامِلُ: or, accord.
to MF, the عَمَل is a motion of the whole, or of a
portion, of the body; and sometimes, of the mind;
so that it is the utterance of a saying, as well as
the doing a deed with the member, or limb, with
which things are gained or earned; though most
readily understood as applied particularly to the
latter; and some apply it particularly to that
which is not a saying: it is also said that a saying
is not termed عَمَلٌ in the common conventional
language: and the truth is said to be, that it is
not included in the terms عَمَلٌ and فِعْلٌ otherwise
than tropically: (TA:) [see also عَمِلَةٌ:] the pl.
of عَمَلٌ [used as a simple subst.] is أَعْمَالٌ. (K.)
In the following saying, of a woman dandling
her child, (S,) or of Keys Ibn-Ásim, (O, TA,)
dandling his child Hakeem, (TA,)
أَشْبِهْ أَبَا أُمِّكَ أَوْ أَشْبِهْ عَمَلْ
the last word is a proper name of a man: (S, O,
TA:) or, accord. to Aboo-Zekereeyà, [the meaning is, Share thou in the qualities of the father of
thy mother, or share thou in the qualities of my
course of action; for he says that] by عَمَلْ is here
meant عَمَلِى. (TA.) اِبْنُ عَمَلِى means He who
does my work, or the like of what I do. (TA in
art. بنى.) And [hence,] فُلَانٌ ابْنُ عَمَلٍ Such a
one is strong. (TA.) And بَنُو عَمَلٍ Those who
journey on foot. (O, K, * TA.) [And عَمَلُ النَّخْلِ,
occurring in the T, voce ضَيْعَةٌ, means The culture
of palm-trees: like as عَمَلُ الأرْضِ means agriculture]. ―
-b2-  And عَمَلٌ signifies also The striving,
labouring, or toiling, in work; or the holding on,
or continuing, in work: so in the saying of El-
Kutámee
فَقَدْ يَهُونُ عَلَى المُسْتَنْجِحِ العَمَلُ
[For verily the striving, &c., in work is a light
matter to him who seeks success]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Also
An office of administration; and particularly the
office of governor of a province; and the office of
collector of the poor-rates, and the like: and an
agency of any kind; the management of the
affairs and property of another; an employment.
―
-b4-  Also A province; or territory under a governor appointed by a sovereign. Pl. in this and
other senses as above.]
عَمِلٌ, as an epithet applied to a man, i. q. ذُو
عَمَلٍ [Having work, labour, or service]; (Sb,
K;) as also ↓ عَمُولٌ: (K:) or adapted, or disposed, by nature, to work, labour, or service; (S,
O, K;) and so ↓ عَمُولٌ: (S, * O, * K:) or this
latter signifies that makes much gain. (TA.) ―
-b2-

service; or of doing, or acting; or of making.

A man bad, or corrupt, in respect of [the mode
of] gain. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also عَمِلَةٌ. ―
-b3-  And see
عُمَالَةٌ.
-A2-  Also The internal state, or condition, of
a man, in relation to evil. (K.)
عَمِلَةٌ, with kesr to the م, is syn. with عَمَلٌ [as
signifying A deed, or an action]: (O, K:) so in
the saying of a woman of the Arabs, مَا كَانَ لِى
عَمِلَةٌ إِلَّا فَسَادُكُمْ [There was no deed, or action,
for me, except the corrupting of you]. (O.) ―
-b2-
And A thing that is done, or performed; or that
is made; (مَا عُمِلَ;) as also ↓ عِمْلةٌ. (K.)
عِمْلَى: see عُمَالَةٌ.
[
عَمَلِىٌّ Practical; opposed to عِلْمِىٌّ: and
fabrile; factitious; or artificial.]
عَمِلَ بِهِ العِمِلِّينَ, with two kesrehs and with
the ل musheddedeh, (K, TA, but in the CK

العِمْلِينَ,] (TA,) or العِملَيْنِ, [thus written without any vowel-sign to the م, and in the dual
form,] (O as on the authority of Aboo-Zeyd,)
and IAar adds العِمْلَيْنِ, with the م quiescent,
(O,) [compare البُلَغِينَ and البُِرَحِينْ, which suggest that the correct forms may be العُمَلِينَ and
العِمَلِينَ,] He exceeded the ordinary bounds, (K,)

عَامِلَةٌ, (TA,) [and likewise in this case of عَامِلٌ,]
signifies oxen that plough, and that tread the

يَعْمَلَاتٌ: (TA: see also عَمِلٌ:) neither of them
is used as an epithet, each being only a subst.,
(M, K, TA,) accord. to Sb, for one does not say
جَمَلٌ يَعْمَلٌ nor نَاقَةٌ يَعْمَلَةٌ, but only يَعْمَلٌ and
يَعْمَلَةٌ as meaning a he-camel and a she-camel;
and hence, he says, we know not يَفْعَل occurring
