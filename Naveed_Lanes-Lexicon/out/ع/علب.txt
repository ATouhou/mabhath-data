sand; then its edges are drawn together, and perforated with a wooden skewer, and it is bound so
as to be closed, [thus] contracted, by a cord [passed
through the holes made with the skewer], and left
until it becomes dry and tough; then its upper
part is cut off, and it stands by reason of its dryness, resembling a round bowl, as though it were
carved out, or fashioned by the turner; the pastor
and the rider suspend it, and milk into it, and
drink out of it; and it is convenient to the man of
the desert by its lightness, and its not breaking
when the camel shakes it about or when it falls to
the ground: (TA:) IAar says that this word and
جَنْبَةٌ and دَسْمَآءُ and سَمْرَآءُ all signify the same:
(O:) the pl. is عُلَبٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and عِلَابٌ.
(S, Msb, K.)
-A2-  Also A tall palm-tree: (O, K:)
[see ↓ عُلْبٌ (voce سَاجِدٌ), a coll. gen. n. used as a
pl.; or a pl., and, if so, app. a contraction of

but some say that it is ↓ عَلَبَةٌ [i. e.] بِالتَّحْرِيك. (O.)

which is a wooden thing having in it holes adapted
to the size of the legs of the persons confined [by
it, i. e. a kind of stocks]: (TA:) pl. عِلَبٌ. (IAar,
O, TA.) A poet says,
فِى رِجْلِهِ عِلْبَةٌ خَشْنَآءُ مِنْ قَرَظٍ
[Upon his leg was a rough kind of stocks of the
wood of the tree called karadh]. (O, TA.)
عَلَبَةٌ: see عُلْبَةٌ, last sentence.
عِلْبَآءٌ [perfectly decl., because the ء is a letter
of quasi-coordination, i. e., added to render the
word quasi-coordinate to the class of قِرْطَاسٌ and
the like,] The عَصَب of the neck; [app. meaning
the upper, cervical, tendinous portion of the trapezius muscle;] (S, O, K; [in all of which, mention is made of the علبآء of the camel, to which
it seems to be most commonly applied, and also
to that of a man;]) it is one of a pair, and between one علبآء and the other is the place of growth
of the mane; (S, O;) Az explains it as specially
applied to the thick عَصَب; and IAth, as the
عَصَب in the neck, extending to the كَاهِل [or part
between the two shoulder-blades]: ISd says that it
is syn. with عَقَبٌ [q. v.]: (TA:) [it is also said
that] it signifies the عَصَبَة [i. e. tendon, or sinew,]
that extends in the neck: (Msb:) or the yellow
عَصَبَة in the side (صَفْحَة) of the neck; one of a
pair: (A:) and the عِلْبَاوَانِ in a man are [said
to be] the two yellow tendons or sinews (العَصَبَتَانِ
الصَّفْرَاوَانِ) in the مَتْن [or part next the spine, on
either side,] of the neck: (Zj in his “ Khalk el-Insán: ”) [but of all the meanings thus assigned to
it, the first seems to be the most proper, or at
least the most usual: see Q. Q. 1:] the Arabs
used to bind therewith, in the fresh, or moist,
state, the أَجْفَان [or sheaths] of their swords, and
also their spears when cracked, and it dried upon
them, and became strong: (IAth, TA:) the
word is masc., (Lh, TA,) or [it is masc. and fem.,
but] the making it fem. is preferred [though this
is contr. to analogy]: (Msb:) the dual is عِلْبَاوَانِ
(S, A, O, Msb) and عِلْبَا آنِ; (S, O, Msb, K;)
[the former app. the more common, but the latter
the more proper;] for the ء [in the sing.] is a letter
of quasi-coordination [and therefore properly with
tenween]; but if you will, you may liken it to
the fem. ء that is in حَمْرَآءُ [of which the dual is
more properly حَمْرَاوَانِ], or to the radical ء [or
rather the ء that is substituted for the last radical
letter] in كِسَآءٌ [of which the dual is more pro-
perly كِسَا آنِ]: (S, O:) and the pl. is عَلَابِىُّ.
(S, O, K.) You say of a man when he has
become advanced in age, تَشَنَّجَ عِلْبَآءُ الرَّجُلِ [The
علبآء of the man has become contracted]. (S, O.)
―
-b2-  The pl. عَلَابِىُّ is expl. in the K as signifying
also Lead: and in the S as signifying lead, or a
kind thereof: (TA:) El-Kutabee says, “I have
been told that العَلَابِىُّ signifies lead; but I am
not sure of it: ” and Az says, “I know not any
one who has said it, and it is not true; ” (O, TA;)
and this is the case: (O:) MF observes that its
explanation as signifying lead requires it to be a
sing. of a pl. form, or a pl. that has no sing., like
أَبَابِيلُ and عَبَادِيدُ: (TA:) in a trad., mention is
made of swords of which the ornaments were
العلابىّ and الآنُك; (O, TA;) and the coupling
of these two words together has led to the supposition that the former means lead; but there is
no evading the fact that it is the pl. of علبَآء meaning the عَصَب of the camel. (TA.)
عُلْبُوبَةُ القَوْمِ The best persons of the people, or
party. (Sh, O, K.)
عِلَابٌ A mark made with a hot iron along the
length of the neck [of a camel], (S, O, K,) upon,
or over, the عِلْبَآء. (TA.)
عَلَابِىُّ pl. of عِلْبَآءٌ [q. v.].
أَعْلَبُ: see عَلِبٌ, last sentence.
مُعْلِبَةٌ: see the next paragraph.
مُعَلَّبٌ A sword having its hilt bound (A, O)
with the عِلْبَآء of a camel; (O;) as also ↓ مَعْلُوبٌ.
(A.) ―
-b2-  And مُعَلَّبَةٌ A she-camel (S, K) marked
with the mark called عِلَاب; (S, O, K;) as also
↓ مُعْلِبَةٌ. (K.)
مُعَلِّبٌ One who makes the kind of vessel called
عُلْبَةٌ. (S, O.)
مُعَلْبَاةٌ One who has a perforation made in her
عِلْبَاوَانِ [dual of عِلْبَآءٌ] with the instrument called
مِدْرًى [q. v.]. (O.)
مَعْلُوبٌ A conspicuous road (S, O, K, TA) that
is marked in its two sides; or marked with the
traces of travellers. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And A sword
broken in its edge. (O.) ―
