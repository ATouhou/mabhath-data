O;) [and in like manner used in relation to a
place; مِنْ كَذَا and عَنْهُ from such a thing; or

aorist.] ↓ إِنَّمَا قَالَهَا تَعَوُّذًا, occurring in a trad.,
means He only said it (referring to the profession
of the faith) to seek protection, or preservation,

is equivalent to the saying may God protect me,
or preserve me]: (S, A, O, L, K:) مَعَاذًا [as also
مَعَاذَةً] being here used instead of the verb because
it is an inf. n., though [accord. to some] not employed as such [in other cases], like as is the case
in the phrase سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ. (S, O, L.) [One says
also, مَعَاذَ اللّٰهِ أَنْ أَفْعَلَ كَذَا, for مِنْ أَنْ أَفْعَلَ كَذَا,
I seek preservation by God, &c., from my doing
such a thing; as though meaning may God preserve me from doing such a thing: see an ex. in
the Kur xii. 79: and] some reckon مَعَاذَ اللّٰهِ among
the forms of oaths. (MF.) [In like manner also,]
عَوْذٌ بِاللّٰهِ مِنْكَ means أَعُوذُ بِاللّٰهِ مِنْكَ [I seek protection, or preservation, by God, &c., from thee].
(S, O, L, K. *) [See also the phrase عَائِذًا بِاللّٰهِ,
voce عَائِذٌ.] ―
-b2-  عَاذَتْ بِوَلَدِهَا (assumed tropical:)  She (a camel) stayed
with her young one, and attended to it affectionately, as long as it remained little, is as though it
were an inverted phrase, meaning عَاذَ بِهَا وَلَدُهَا

from what next follows]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  عاذ بِالعَظْمِ

says, اَللّٰهُمَّ عَائِذًا بِكَ مِنْ كُلِّ سُوْءٍ, meaning, accord. to Az, أَعُوذُ بِكَ عَائِذًا [lit. O God, I seek
protection, or preservation, by Thee, &c., seeking,
&c., from every evil]: but accord. to Sb, in the phrase
عَائِذًا بِاللّٰهِ مِنْ شَرِّهَا, the word عائذا is put in the
place of the inf. n. [as an absolute complement of
أَعُوذُ understood; so that the meaning is, I seek

[SM says that the word thus expl. in the K is a
mistranscription for معوّد; by which he means
مُعَوِّد, part. n. of عَوَّدَ said of a camel; but this I
doubt; for مُعَوِّدٌ has not the meaning here assigned to معوّذ.] ―

مُعَوِّذٌ: see عُوَّذٌ, in two places: ―
