whence the saying, in a trad., أَتَدْرُونَ مَا العَضْهُ
(TA) i. e. [Know ye what is] the reporting of conversation, or of what has been said, from one
person to another, to make mischief between them?
(El-Jámi' es-Sagheer:) [or,] accord. to IAth,
the calumnious speech between men? or, accord. to
As, the evil, or foul, speaking? (TA.) And the
same verb, (so accord. to my MS. copy of the
K,) or عَضِهَ, (so accord. to other copies and the
TA,) He uttered falsehood and calumny; as also
↓ اعضه: (K, TA:) [whence] one says, قَدْ

-A2-  See also 1, latter half, in

عَضِهٌ: see عَاضِهٌ, in three places. ―
-b2-  أَرْضٌ عَضِهَةٌ
and ↓ عَضِيهَةٌ (K, TA) and ↓ مُعْضِهَةٌ (S, K, TA)
A land having trees such as are called عِضَاه:
(TA:) or abounding with such trees. (S, K, TA.)
عِضَهٌ [also pronounced ↓ عِضَةٌ] A lie, or falsehood; and a calumny; (Ks, S, K, TA;) as also
↓ عَضِيهَةٌ: (S, TA: *) the former said by Et-Toosee
to be a mistranscription for عَضْهٌ; but it is not so:
(IB, TA:) and it signifies also enchantment, (S,
K, TA,) and divination: (S, TA:) and its pl.,
(S, K,) or [rather] the pl. of ↓ عِضَةٌ, (thus accord.
to the TA and one of my copies of the S,) is
عِضُونَ, like as عِزُونَ is of عِزَةٌ: (S, K, TA:)
whence the saying in the Kur [xv. 91], الَّذِينَ
جَعَلُوا الْقُرْآنَ عِضِينَ [Those who pronounced the
Kur-án to be lies, or enchantments]: (S, TA:)
accord. to Fr, [the sing.] ↓ عِضَةٌ is originally عِضَهَةٌ,
the deficient [radical] letter being ه; (S, * TA;)
for عِضَةٌ and عِضُونَ in the dial. of Kureysh signify enchantment [and enchantments], and they
term the enchanter عَاضِهٌ: (S:) or, as some say,
the deficient [radical] letter is و, (S, TA,) from
عَضَوْتُهُ meaning فَرَّقْتُهُ, (S,) or from عَضَّيْتُ الشَّىْءَ
meaning فَرَّقْتُهُ; (TA;) because they divided
their sayings respecting the Kur-án, pronouncing
it to be falsehood, or enchantment, or divination,
or poetry. (S, TA.) And one says, ↓ يَالِلْعَضِيهَةِ,
with kesr to the ل, [O the lie?] denoting a
calling to aid; (S;) or said on an occasion of
wondering at a great lie; and with fet-h to the
ل [i. e. يَا لَلْعَضِيهَةِ] denoting a calling for aid.
(TA.)
عِضَةٌ, originally عِضَهَةٌ: see عِضَاهٌ, in two places.
-A2-  And see also عِضَهٌ, in three places: and
art. عضو.
عِضَهَةٌ: see عِضَاهٌ.
عِضَهِىٌّ, applied to a camel, That depastures the
trees called عِضَاه; as also ↓ عِضَاهِىٌّ so applied;
(S, K;) and in like manner, applied to camels,
↓ عِضَاهِيَّةٌ; (S;) the second and third being
rel. ns. from عِضَةٌ, and therefore irregularly
formed, or from عِضَاهَةٌ, not from عِضَاهٌ because
this is a pl. or has the meaning of a pl.: (TA:)
so too عَضَوِىٌّ applied to a camel, (S, K,) and
عَضَوِيَّةٌ applied to camels, both with fet-h, irregular. (S.) [See also عَاضِهٌ.]
عِضَاهٌ Any great trees having thorns; these being
of two sorts, genuine (خَالِص) and not genuine
(غَيْرُ خَالِصٍ): the former sort are the عَرْف, the
عُرْفُط, the طَلْح, the سَلَم, the سِدْر, the سَيَال, the
سَمْر, the يَنْبُوت, the greater قَتَاد, the كَنَهْبَل, the
غَرْب, and the عَوْسَج: the other sort are the شَوْحَط.
the نَبْع, the شِرْيَان, the سَرَآء, the نَشَم, the عُجْرُم,
and the تأْلَب; and these are called the عِضَاه of
bows (عِضَاهُ القِيَاسِ [i. e. القِسِىِّ] pl. of قَوْسٌ): the
small thorny trees are called عِضٌّ [q. v.]: and
such as are neither عِضّ nor عِضَاه, of thorny
trees, are the شُكَاعَى, the حُلَاوَى, the حَاذ, the
كُبّ, and the سُلَّج: (S:) or, as AZ says in the
beginning of his book of herbage and trees, عِضَاهٌ
is the general name of certain thorny trees which
have different particular names: the genuine
عِضَاه (العِضَاهُ الخَالِصُ) are those which are large
and have strong thorns: such as are small, of
thorny trees, are called عِضٌّ and شِرْسٌ [q. v.]: of
the عِضَاه are the سَمُر, the عُرْفَط, the سَيَال, the قَرَظ,
the greater قَتَاد, the كَنَهْبَل, the عَوْسَج, the سِدْر,
the غَاف, and the غَرْب: these are the genuine
عِضَاه: and of the عِضَاه of bows (عِضَاهُ القِيَاسِ i. e.
القِسِىِّ) are the شَوْحَط, the نَبْع, the شِرْيَان, and
the سَرَآء: (TA voce عِضٌّ:) or عِضَاهٌ signifies any
trees having thorns; as the طَلْح and the عَوْسَج:
or, accord. to some, except the قَتَاد and the سِدْر:
(Msb:) or the greatest of trees: or the خَمْط
[q. v., for it is variously explained]: or any
having thorns: or such as are great and tall, of
these: (K:) [حُبْلَةٌ and سِنْفَةٌ are terms applied
to the fruit, or produce, of trees of the kind called
عِضَاه: see the former of those words:] a single
tree thereof is called عِضَاهَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ عِضَهَةٌ
and ↓ عِضَةٌ, (S, Msb, K, [but in the copies of the
K the last of these is erroneously written عِضَه,])
the radical ه being rejected in the last, as it is in
شَفَةٌ; or, accord. to some, the rejected radical
letter is و; (AAF, S, Msb; *) opinions differing on
this point because of the different forms of the pl.;
(AAF, S, TA;) the pl. being عِضَاهٌ and (of pauc.,
TA) عِضَوَاتٌ (AAF, S, K, TA, in the CK
عِضْواتٌ,) and عِضُونَ; (K;) [the second and third
of which are pls. of ↓ عِضَةٌ;] or, accord. to ISd,
عِضَاهٌ may be an instance of the kind of pl. that
differs from its sing, [only] in respect of the ة,
like قَتَادٌ, of which the sing. is قَتَادَةٌ, [i. e., what
is more properly termed a coll. gen. n.,] or it
may be a broken pl., as though its sing. were
عِضَهَةٌ: (TA:) the dim. [of عِضَهَةٌ] is ↓ عُضَيْهَةٌ. (S,
TA.) [Hence,] one says, فُلَانٌ يَنْتَجِبُ غَيْرَ عِضَاهِهِ
[lit. Such a one takes the back of other than his
own عضاه, to tan therewith]; meaning (assumed tropical:)  such a
one arrogates to himself the poetry of another.
(S. See a verse cited in art. نجب.) [See also 1,
first sentence.]
عَضِيهَةٌ: see عَضِهٌ.
-A2-  And see also عِضَهٌ, in
two places.
عُضَيْهَةٌ [dim. of عِضَهَةٌ]: see عِضَاهٌ.
عِضَاهِىٌّ; and its fem., with ة: see عِضَهِىٌّ.
عَاضِهٌ applied to a he-camel, as also ↓ عَضِهٌ, (S,)
and عَاضِهَةٌ applied to a she-camel, (S, K,) and
thus also عَاضِهٌ, (K,) Depasturing the trees called
عِضَاه; (S, K, TA;) and the pl. [of عَاضِهٌ and
عَاضِهَةٌ] in this sense, applied to camels, is عَوَاضِهُ:
(S, TA:) or, accord. to 'Alee Ibn-Hamzeh, (IB,
TA,) ↓ عَضِهٌ has this meaning; (IB, Msb, TA;)
but عَاضِهٌ signifies having a complaint from eating
the عِضَاه: (IB, TA:) or ↓ عَضِهٌ has the latter
meaning, or the former meaning: or, accord. to
AHn, عَضِهَةٌ applied to a she-camel signifies
breaking the branches, or twigs, of the عِضَاه.
(TA.) [See also عِضَهِىٌّ.]
-A2-  Also Enchanting,
or an enchanter; (As, S, K, TA;) in the dial. of
Kureysh. (As, S, TA.) See also the last paragraph of this art. A poet says,
أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّى مِنَ النَّافِثَا
↓ تِ فِى عُقَدِ العَاضِهِ المُعْضِهِ
[I seek protection by my Lord from the women
sputtering upon the knots of the lying enchanter:
see art. نفث, and the Kur-án cxiii. 4]: (S, TA:)
or, as some relate it, فى عِضَهِ [upon the enchantment]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And حَيَّةٌ عَاضِهٌ and عَاضِهَةٌ A
serpent that kills instantly (AO, S, K) when it
bites. (AO, S.)
مُعْضِهٌ: see its fem. voce عَضِهٌ:
-A2-  and see the
verse cited voce عَاضِهٌ.
مُسْتَعْضِهَةٌ A woman seeking, or demanding, enchantment: hence the trad., ↓ لَعَنَ اللّٰهُ العَاضِهَةَ
وَالمُسْتَعْضِهَةَ [May God curse her who enchants
and her who seeks, or demands, enchantment].
(TA.)
