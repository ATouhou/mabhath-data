pustules, like the [cutaneous eruption called] قُوَبَآء
[q. v.], which comes forth in camels, dispersedly,
in their lips (S, O) and their legs, (S,) discharging
a fluid which resembles yellow water; in consequence of which the healthy camels are cauterized,
in order that the diseased may not communicate to
them the malady. (S, O.) En-Nábighah says,
(addressing En-Noamán Ibn-El-Mundhir, O,)
فَحَمَّلْتَنِى ذَنْبَ امْرِئٍ وَتَرَكْتَهُ

offence, of a man other than myself, and left him
like that which has the disease called عُرّ, another
than which is cauterized while he is pasturing at
pleasure]: he who says العَرّ, in relating this verse,
errs; for cauterization is not practised as a preservative from the mange, or scab. (IDrd, S, O.)

like عَرْعَر; and particularly to the species thereof
called the savin]; and he adds that he knew it
in his own country, and afterwards saw it in the
province of Kazween, cut for firewood from the
mountains thereof, in the borders of Ed-Deylem;
whence he knew that his informant was well
acquainted with it, for those mountains are places
of growth of the ابهل: (O:) he says that it has
a fruit like the نَبِق [or fruit of the lote-tree called
سِدْر], first green, then becoming white, then becoming black until it is like حُمَم [or charcoal, &c.],
