عيف1
عَافَهُ, aor. يَعَافَهُ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) and
يَعِيفُهُ, (Fr, O, K,) inf. n. عِيَافٌ, (S, Mgh, O,) or
عِيَافَةٌ, (Msb, [but probably a mistranscription for
the former,]) or both, or the latter is a simple
subst., and the former is an inf. n., also عَيْفٌ and
عَيَفَانٌ, (ISd, K,) He (a man, S, O, Msb, [and
any animal,]) disliked it, or loathed it, (S, Mgh,
O, Msb, K,) namely, food, (S, O, Msb, K,) or
water, (Mgh,) or beverage, (S, O, Msb, K,) and
would not drink it, (S, O, K,) and sometimes it
is said in relation to other things, (K,) but mostly
in relation to food: (ISd, TA:) and ↓ اِعْتَافَهُ
signifies the same as عَافَهُ. (TA.) A poet says,
(namely, Anas Ibn-Mudrik, O, TA, and so in
a copy of the S,)
إِنِّى وَقَتْلِى سُلَيْكًا ثُمَّ أَعْقِلُهُ
كَالثَّوْرِ يُضْرَبُ لَمَّا عَافَتِ البَقَرُ
[Verily I, in the case of my slaying Suleyk and
then giving the bloodwit for slaying him, am like
the bull that is beaten when the cows loathe the
water]: for when the cows hold back from entering into the water and drinking, they are not
beaten, because they have milk, but only the bull
is beaten, in order that they may be frightened,
and therefore drink. (S, O, TA. [See also the
Ham, p. 416; where the former hemistich is somewhat differently related.]) And hence the saying,
هٰذَا مِمَّا يَعَافُهُالطَّبْعُ [This is of the things that the
natural disposition dislikes, or loathes]. (Mgh.)
-A2-  عِفْتُ الطَّيْرَ, aor. أَعِيفُهَا, inf. n. عِيَافَةٌ, I augured
from the birds, (S, O, K, TA,) good or evil, (O,
K, TA,) taking warning, or the like, by considering their names, and their places of alighting
(S, O, K, TA) and of passage, (TA,) and their
cries: thus, correctly, as in the T and S and M
and L, i. e. وَأَصْوَاتِهَا; for which the authors of
the O and K have substituted وَأَنْوَائِهَا, deceived
by the word مَسَاقِط in what goes before: and the
verb is used in like manner in relation to gazelles
or other animals passing with the right side, or
the left side, turned towards the spectator: (TA:)
العِيَافَةُ primarily signifies the man's throwing a
pebble at a bird, or crying out at it; and, if it
turn its right side towards him in flying, the
auguring good from it; and if its left side, evil:
(Har p. 308:) or, accord. to Az, it signifies the
seeing a bird, (TA,) or a raven, or crow, (Msb,
TA,) or the like, (Msb,) and auguring evil [or
good] therefrom: (Msb, TA:) and also the saying [a thing] conjecturally, or surmising; without
seeing anything: and it is said in a trad. to be
مِنَ الجِبْتِ [expl. in art. جبت]: the verb in
عِفْتُ الطَّيْرَ, as ISd says, is originally عَيِفْتُ.
(TA.)
-A3-  عَافَتِ الطَّيْرُ, aor. تَعِيفُ, inf. n. عَيْفٌ,
(S, O, K,) is like عافت having for its aor,
تَعُوفُ and inf. n. عَوْفٌ, (K, TA,) i. e. (TA) The
birds circled over the water, or over carcasses or
corpses, and went to and fro, not going away,
desiring to alight. (S, O, TA. [See also art.
عوف.])
4
أَعَافُوا [They became in the condition of finding that] their beasts disliked, or loathed, the
water, and would not drink it. (ISk, O, K.)
5
تعيّف is probably used as signifying He
practised عِيَافَة, i. e. auguration from birds, &c.
see its part. n., below.]
8
إِعْتَيَفَ see 1, first sentence.
-A2-  Accord. to Ibn-
'Abbád, (O,) اعتاف signifies He furnished himself with provisions for journeying. (O, K.)
عَيْفَةٌ is a term employed in the case when a
woman brings forth and her milk is suppressed
in her breast, wherefore her fellow-wife, or female
neighbour, draws it, by the single sucking and
the two suckings: (Nh, O, L, K, * TA: but in
the K, فَتَرْضِعُهَا is erroneously put for فَتَرْضِعُهُ;
and المَرَّةَ and المَرَّتَيْنِ are put for المَرَّةَ and
المَرَّتَيْنِ: TA:) thus in the saying of ElMugheereh, (O, K, TA,) as expl. by himself, (O,
TA,) لَا تُحَرِّمُ العَيْفَةُ [i. e. The woman's sucking
once and twice in drawing the breast of another
woman whose milk is suppressed after child-birth
will not render unlawful the marriage of either of
them to a relation of the other, nor the marriage
of a relation of either to a relation of the other;
as the case of regular or continued suckling of
a child does]: (O, K, TA: [but in the O and
CK, تُحَرَّمُ is erroneously put for تُحَرِّمُ: see a
similar saying voce مَزَّةٌ:]) the action is performed
in order that the obstructed channels by which
the milk issues may become opened: and it is
thus termed because the woman loathes it: (Az,
O, K:) A'Obeyd says, We know not العَيْفَة in
sucking the breast, but think it to be العُفَّة: his
saying thus, however, is disapproved by Az.
(O, K, * TA.)
-A2-  عَيْفَةٌ is also the subst. from
عَافَتِ الطَّيْرُ [q. v., app. signifying A circling of
birds over the water, &c.]. (S, O, K.)
عِيفَةٌ A good thing: (O:) or the choice, or
best, or excellent, of camels or cattle or other
property: (K:) like عِيمَةٌ. (O, K.)
العَيَافُ and الطَّرِيدَةُ are Two games (Sh, O, K)
of the boys of the Arabs of the desert: (Sh, O:
[see the latter of these words:]) or the former is
what is called لُعْبَةُ الغُمَيْصَآءِ, or, as in some of the
copies of the K, الغُمَيْضَآءِ. (K, TA. [But I do
not find elsewhere الغُمَيْصَآء as the name of a game,
nor الغُمَيْضَآء in any sense.])
عَيُوفٌ: see عَائِفٌ. Applied to a camel, it means
That smells the water and then leaves it, though
thirsty. (S, O, K.)
عَيْفانٌ: see عَائِفٌ.
عَيَفَانٌ, like تَيَّهَانٌ, (O, K,) or عَيِّفَانٌ, like تَيِّهَانٌ,
(so in the CK,) One whose natural disposition,
(O, K,) and habit, or wont, (K,) it is to dislike,
or loathe, a thing. (O, K.)
عَائِفٌ Disliking, or loathing, food or beverage:
(S, TA:) and ↓ عَيُوفٌ and ↓ عَيْفَانٌ, applied to a
man, signify the same as عَائِفٌ [app. in this
sense: see an ex. of the former in a verse of Ibn-Mukbil cited voce سَوْفَ, last sentence]. (TA.)
-A2-  Auguring, or divining, (S, O, K,) from birds
or other things. (O, K,) ―
-b2-  كَانَ عَائِفًا, said of
Shureyh, in a trad, of Ibn-Seereen, means He
was true in conjecture and opinion: like the
saying, of him who is right in his opinion, مَا هُوَ
إِلَّا كَاهِنٌ; and of him who is eloquent in his
speech, مَا هُوَ إِلَّا سَاحِرٌ. (TA.)
-A3-  طَيْرٌ عَائِفَةٌ Birds
circling over water, or over carcasses or corpses,
and going to and fro, not going away, desiring to
alight. (S, O.) And نُسُورٌ عَوَائِفُ [Vultures]
circling over the slain, and going to and fro.
(TA.)
مَعِيفٌ, applied to food [and beverage], Disliked, or loathed. (Msb.)
مُتَعَيِّفٌ One who practises auguration from
birds [&c.]. (Har p. 564.)
