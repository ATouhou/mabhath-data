aided, helped, or assisted, him, being aided, &c.,
by him:] see 6: ―
-b2-  and i. q. أَعَانَهُ: see the latter,
and see also 10.
4
اعانهُ [inf. n. إِعَانَةٌ] and ↓ عَاوَنَهُ signify the
same, (S, * MA, K,) i. e. He aided, helped, or
assisted, him. (MA.) رَبِّ أَعِنِّى وَلَا تُعِنْ عَلَىَّ
[O my Lord, aid me, and aid not against me,] is
said in a form of prayer. (S.) [And you say,
اعانهُ عَلَي الأَمْرِ lit. He aided him against, meaning, to accomplish, or perform, the affair]. See

6
تَعَاوَنُوا signifies بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا ↓ أَعَانَ, (S,
Msb, K,) They aided, helped, or assisted, one
another; (MA;) as also ↓ عَاوَنُوا; (Msb;) and
↓ اِعْتَوَنُوا, (S, K,) in which the و is preserved
because it is preserved in تعاونوا with which it is
syn.; (Sb, S;) and also ↓ اِعْتَانُوا, accord. to IB,
who cites as an ex. a verse in which نَعْتَانُ occurs;
but this correctly means نَأْخُذُ العِينَةَ [belonging
to art. عين]. (TA.) One says, تَعاونوا عَلَي الأَمْرِ
They aided, helped, or assisted, one another [lit.
against, meaning, to accomplish, the affair].

Mgh, Msb, * K) and ↓ عَاوَنَنِى, (S, TA,) for
which last, ↓ عَوَّنَنِى is erroneously put in the
copies of the K; (TA;) [i. e. I sought, &c., of
him, aid, &c., and he aided me.] The alteration
of the infirm letter [و into ا] is made in استعان
and ↓ اعان in imitation of a general rule [which
requires it when that alteration is made in the
unaugmented triliteral verb], though عَانَ, aor.
يَعُونُ, [as their source of derivation,] is not used.
(TA.) ب [i. e. بِ] is called حَرْفُ اسْتِعَانَةٍ [A
particle denotative of seeking aid, &c.,] because
when you say ضَرَبْتُ بِالسَّيْفِ and كَتَبْتُ بِالقَلَمِ
and بَرَيْتُ بِالمُدْيَةِ, it is as though you said اِسْتَعَنْتُ
بِهٰذِهِ الأَدَوَاتِ عَلَي هٰذِهِ الأَفْعَالِ [meaning I sought
aid of these instruments, or made use of them as
means, against, i. e. to perform, these actions of
smiting &c.]. (TA.) [And you say, استعان
بِنَفْسِهِ, meaning He sought self-help, or exerted
himself, فِي أَمْرٍ in an affair, and عَلَيْهِ against it,
or him.]

K) and ↓ مَعْوُنَةٌ, (K, TA,) with damm to the و,

↓ مَعُونٌ, (S, K,) [respecting the second and last
of which see what follows,] are simply substs.,
(Mgh, Msb, K,) and signify Aid, help, or assistance: (S, Mgh, * Msb, * K: *) عَوْنٌ is one of those
quasi-inf. ns. that govern like the inf. n., i. e. like
the verb; as in the saying,
إِذَا صَحَّ عَوْنُ الخَالِقِ الْمَرْءَ لَمْ يَجِدْ
عَسِيراً مِنَ الآمَالِ إِلَّا مُيَسَّرَا
[When the Creator's aiding the man is true, he will

from العَوْنُ; (Az, TA;) or, as some say, of the
measure فَعُولَةٌ, from المَاعُونُ: (Az, Msb, TA:)
one says, مَا عِنْدَكَ مَعُونَةٌ and ↓ مَعَانَةٌ and عَوْنٌ
[i. e. There is not with thee any aid]: (S:) and
↓ مَا أَخْلَانِى فُلَانٌ مِنْ مَعَاوِنِهِ [Such a one did not
make me to be destitute of his aids]; مَعَاوِنُ being
pl. of مَعُونَةٌ: (S, TA:) ↓ مَعُونٌ is said by Ks to
be syn. with مَعُونَةٌ; (S;) and he says that it is
the only masc. of the measure مَفْعُلٌ except مَكْرُمٌ:
(TA:) an ex. of it occurs in a verse of Jemeel
cited voce أَىُّ: Fr says that it is pl. [virtually,
though not in the language of the grammarians,]
of مَعُونَةٌ; (S, TA;) and that there is no sing. of
the measure مَفْعُلٌ. (S. [On this point, see
مَأْلُكٌ, voce أَلُوكٌ.]) ―

K;) and ↓ عَوِينٌ is a quasi-pl. n., (K,) said by
AA to be syn. with أَعْوَانٌ, and Fr says the like.
(TA.) The Arabs say, السَّنَةُ جَآءَتْ مَعَهَا
أَعْوَانُهَا, meaning When drought comes, [its aiders]
the locusts and the flies and diseases come with it.
(TA.) And عَوْنٌ signifies Anything that aids,
helps, or assists, one: for instance, [one says,]
الصَّوْمُ عَوْنُ العِبَادَةِ [Fasting is the aider of
religious service]. (Lth, TA.) ―
-b3-  See also what
next follows.
أَبُو عُونٍ, with damm, Dates: and salt: (K:)

meaning; salt being metonymically thus called
because its aid is sought for the eating of food.

the hair above the anterior pudendum of a man
(Msb, TA) and of a woman; (TA;) the hair
itself being called the شِعْرَة (Mgh, Msb, TA) and
the إِسْب; (Msb, TA;) though it is also called
عانة (Mgh, Msb) by an extension of the proper
meaning (Mgh) or by an ellipsis: (Msb:) the
word is originally عَوَنَةٌ: (Msb:) and the dim. is
↓ عُوَيْنَةٌ. (Mgh.)
-A3-  فُلَانٌ عَلَي عَلَي عَانَةِ بَكْرِ بْنِ وَائِلٍ
