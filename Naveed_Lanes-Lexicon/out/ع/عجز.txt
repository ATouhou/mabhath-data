عجز1
عَجڤزَ The primary signification of عَجْزٌ [an inf. n.
of عَجَزَ] is The being, or becoming, behind, or
behindhand, or backward, with respect to a thing;
or holding back, hanging back, or abstaining, from
it: and its happening at the latter, or last, part,
or at the end, of an affair: and hence, in common
conventional language, it has the signification
shown by the explanation here next following.
(Er-Rághib, B, &c., and TA.) ―
-b2-  عَجَزَ, aor.
عَجِزَ,
inf. n. عَجْزٌ and مَعْجَزَةٌ and مَعْجِزَةٌ (S, Mgh, O,
Msb, K) and مَعْجَزٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) which is
agreeable with rule, (S,) and مَعْجِزٌ, (S, O, Msb,
K,) which is extr., (Sb, TA,) and عَجَزَانٌ and
عُجُوزٌ; (O, K;) and عَجِزَ, aor.
عَجَزَ, (O, Msb, K,)
inf. n. عَجَزٌ, (Msb,) said by IKtt to be mentioned
by Fr, as of the dial. of some of the tribe of Keys,
but by others [and among them Sgh in the O]
said to be a bad form, (TA,) or mentioned by
AZ, as of the dial. of some of the tribe of Keys-
'Eylán, but not known to them, and said by IF
to be disallowed by IAar in the sense here immediately following; (Msb;) He lacked strength, or
power, or ability; he was, or became, powerless,
impotent, or unable. (S, * Msb, * K, TA.) You
say, عَجَزَ عَنْ كَذَا, (S, A, O, Msb, TA,) and
accord. to some, as shown above, عَجِزَ عَنْهُ,
(Msb, TA,) He lacked strength, or power, or
ability, for, or to do, effect, accomplish, achieve,
attain, or compass, such a thing; he was unable
to do it: (S, * O, * Msb, * TA:) or (tropical:)  he was too
old to do it. (A, TA.) And it is said in a trad.,
(S, * Mgh,) of 'Omar, (TA,) لَا تُلِثُّوا بِدَارِ مَعْجَزَةٍ,
meaning Remain ye not in a country, or district,
or town, where ye are unable to gain your livelihood.
(S, A, Mgh, * TA.) You say also, لَا يَسَعُنِى شَىْءٌ

بِجَيْشٍ تَعْجِزُ الأَرْضُ عَنْهُ (tropical:)  [They came with an
army which the earth had not strength to bear,
or scarce sufficed to contain]. (A, TA.) ―
-b3-  [And
عَجَزَ عَنْ كَذَا also signifies He, or it, lacked such
a thing: see an ex. voce عَرْفٌ.] ―

following senses, i. e., in the general application;
and in the second, or restricted application, fem.,

two hips, (Mgh, Msb,) or what is after the back,
(TA,) of a man, and of a woman; (S, Mgh, O,

TA.) And رَكِبَ فِى الطَّلَبِ أَعْجَازَ الإِبِلِ He

نَأْخُذْهُ وَإِنْ نُمْنَعْهُ نَرْكَبْ أَعْجَازَ الإِبِلِ وَإِنْ طَالَ
السُّرَى [There is a right belonging to us: if we be
given it, we take it: and if we be refused it, we
expose ourselves to abasement, &c., though the
night-journeying be long]: (O, * TA:) or, accord.
to Az, he does not mean this, but alludes to
others' having precedence in respect of his right,
and his being himself kept back from it. (TA.)
One also says, بَنُو فُلَانٍ يَرْكَبُونَ أَعْجَازَ الإِبِلِ
The sons of such a one are in a state of abasement,
dependents of others: or experience difficulties;
because the rump, or croup, of the camel is a
difficult place to ride upon. (A.) And it is said
by one of the wise, (Aktham Ibn-Seyfee, T, in
TA, art. دبر,) لَا تَدَبَّرُوا أَعْجَازَ أُمُورٍ قَدْ وَلَّتْ
صُدُورُهَا, (TA, in this art., and O,) or لَا تَتَدَبَّرُوا,
(T, in TA, art. دبر,) (tropical:)  [Think ye not upon the
ends of things whereof the beginnings have passed:]
meaning, when a thing has passed, make not your
minds, or desires, to follow after it, regretting
what has passed, but be consoled for it, placing
your reliance upon God: (O, TA:) and, as IAth
says, it is intended to incite to the consideration
of the results, or issues, of affairs before the
entering upon them. (TA.) [See also دَبَّرَ.] ―
-b2-
أَعْجَازُ نَخْلٍ The trunks of palm-trees. (S, O, K.)

say, فُلَانٌ عِجْزَةُ وَلَدِ أَبَوَيْهِ Such a one is the last
of the children of his parents; and in like manner
you say of a female, and of a plural number: (S,
O, TA:) and so, [accord. to some,] كِبْرَةُ وَلَدِ
أَبَوَيْهِ. (TA.) You say also, وُلِدَ لِعِجْزَةٍ He was
born after his parents had become old: and such
you term اِبْنُ العِجْزَةِ. (O, TA.)
عَجُوزٌ i. q. عَاجِزٌ, q. v. (K.) ―
-b2-  An old, or
aged, woman: (S, O, Msb, K:) a woman extremely old; or old and weak: so called because
of her inability to do many things: (TA:) [this is
the most common signification of the word:]
accord. to ISk, (S, O, Msb,) you should not say
↓ عَجُوزَةٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;) or this is bad; (K;)
and is said by the vulgar; (S, O;) but IAar
authorizes it; (O;) and IAmb allows it, to demonstrate its being fem.; and Yoo is related to
have heard it from the Arabs: (Msb:) pl. عَجَائِزُ,
(S, O, Msb, K,) or this is pl. of عَجُوزَةٌ; (R,

contraction of عُجُزٌ, occurring in traditions. (TA.)

-b4-  [It has a
great variety of other significations; but these

be mentioned (ان شآء اللّٰه) in Book II.]
-A4-  أَيَّامُ
العَجُوزِ; (S, O, K;) also called ↓ أَيَّامُ العَجُزِ, because they come in the latter part (عَجُز) of
winter; but the former is the correct appellation;
(MF;) accord. to the usage of the Arabs, Five
days, the names of which are صِنٌّ and صِنَّبْرٌ and
وَبْرٌ and مُطْفِئُ الجَمْرِ and مُكْفِئُ الظَّعْنِ; said by
Ibn-Kunáseh to be of the نَوْء of الصَّرْفَة [by which
is meant the auroral setting of the Twelfth Mansion of the Moon, which, in Central Arabia, about
the commencement of the era of the Flight,
happened on the 9th of March O. S.: in the
modern Egyptian Almanacs, the ايّام العجوز are
said to commence now on the 9th of March N. S.,
which is now the 26th of February O. S.]: (S,
O, TA:) or, accord. to Abu-l-Ghowth, (S,) they
are seven days, (S, K,) named صِنٌّ and صِنَّبْرٌ and
وَبْرٌ and الآمِرُ and المُؤْتَمِرُ and المُعَلِّلُ and مُطْفِئُ
الجَمْرِ, or مُكْفِئُ الظَّعْنِ: (K:) and some reckon
مكفئ الظعن an eighth: but most authors hold
these names to be post-classical: (MF:) accord.
to Esh-Shereeshee, they are seven days; four of
the last [days] of February, and three of the first
[days] of March: (Har p. 295:) during these
days blew the wind by which the tribe of 'Ád
was destroyed: and they are thus called because
they are [in] the latter part (عَجْز) of winter; or
because an old woman (عَجُوز) of 'Ád concealed
herself in a subterranean excavation, from which
the wind dragged her forth on the eighth day,
and destroyed her: (Bd in lxix. 7:) or آمِرٌ and
مُؤْتَمِرٌ are the names of the last two days; (K in
art. امر;) the former being the sixth, and the
latter the seventh. (M in that art.) Ibn-Ahmar
says, (S,) or, accord. to IB, not Ibn-Ahmar,
but Aboo-Shibl 'Ásim Ibn-el-Aarábee, as Th says,
on the authority of IAar, (TA,) or Aboo-Shibl
'Osm Ibn-Wahb Et-Temeemee, (O,)
كُسِعَ الشِّتَآءُ بِسَبْعَةٍ غُبْرِ

[The winter is driven away, or is closed, by seven
dusty (days), our old woman's days of the month;
and when her days come to an end, and Sinn and
Sinnabr, with El-Webr, and with Ámir and his
little brother Mu-temir, and Mo'allil, and with
Mutfi-el-Jemr, pass, the winter goes away, retiring
quickly, and a burning wind (رِيحٌ being understood) comes to thee from the first day of the
ensuing month, or, accord. to a reading which I
find in one copy of the S, from the sea, مِنَ البَحْرِ].

not escape in the earth, nor shall those in the

ye shall not escape in the earth, nor should ye if
ye were in the heaven: or, accord. to Akh, and
ye shall not escape by fleeing in the earth nor in
the heaven: but Az says that the explanation of
Fr is the best known. (L.) ―
