عَمَهَ,
(K,) inf. n. عَمَهٌ (S, Msb, K, TA, [عَمْهًا in the CK
being a mistake for عَمَهًا,]) and عُمُوهٌ and عُمُوهَةٌ
and عَمَهَانٌ, (K, TA,) [the first of the former verb,
and the rest, app., of the latter verb,] He was, or
became, confounded, or perplexed, and unable to
see his right course; and went repeatedly to and
fro: (S:) or he went repeatedly to and fro-
(Msb, K,) in confusion, or perplexity, (Msb,) or

to see his right course, (Msb, K,) in contending,
disputing, or litigating; or in a way, or road:
(K:) or he knew not the [right] argument, or
plea, or allegation: (Th, K, TA:) and ↓ تعامه
signifies the same: (Z, K, TA:) all are said when
one turns aside, or away, from that which is
right, or true: (TA:) or العَمَهُ is the looking
repeatedly, not knowing whither to go: (Lh, TA:)
or it is in the mental perception; and العَمَى is in
the sight, or is common to both of these. (TA.)
[Accord. to the Msb, عَمِهَ is from عَمْهَآء as an
epithet applied to land, expl. below: but this
requires consideration, as appears from what here
follows.] ―
-b2-  One says also, عَمِهَتِ الأَرْضُ (tropical:)  The
land was destitute of signs of the way: (K, TA:)
a tropical phrase. (TA.)

above: but some hold it to be tropical: see 1,
last sentence.]
