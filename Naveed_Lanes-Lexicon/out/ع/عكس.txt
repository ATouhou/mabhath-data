عَكَسَهُ, aor.
عَكِسَ, (A, * Msb, K, *) inf. n. عَكْسٌ,
(S, A, O, Msb, K,) He reversed it; made the
last part of it to be first, and the first to be last;
or turned it kind part before, and fore part behind.

(A, O, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (O,) He inverted, reversed, converted, or transposed, the
language or sentence, and the like; [as, for instance, a word;] he changed its order by inversion
or transposition: (A, O, K:) sometimes a word,

instances of بَابٌ and خَوْخٌ and عَكَوْكَعٌ: (TA:)
or he perverted its order (TA) [or its meaning:
see مَعْكُوسٌ]. [Hence the phrase بِالْعَكْسِ Vice
versâ.] One says to him who speaks wrongly,
لاَ تَعْكِسْ [Pervert not thou]. (A.) And ↓ مُعَاكَسَةٌ

with her head turned backwards towards the
part next her breast and belly, or, as some say,
towards her hinder part next the back, and to
leave her in that state until she died. (S, O.)

rein (جَرِير) of the camel, and kept fast hold of
his head, so that he went an easy and a quick
pace: and عَكَسَ الدَّابَّةَ is said to signify he pulled
the head of the beast towards him, to make him
go backwards. (TA.) ―

of what it was to him]. (Msb.) ―
