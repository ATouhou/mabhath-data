عَطَبَ, (A,
Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. عَطَبٌ, (S, * Mgh, * O, *
Msb,) and مَعْطَبٌ also may be an inf. n. of the
same, (Har p. 196,) He perished, or died: (S, A,
Mgh, O, Msb, K:) [Freytag mentions عَطَبَ also
in the same sense, as from the K, in which I do
not find it:] it is said of a man, and of other than
man: in a trad. it is said of seed-produce. (TA.)
―
-b2-  And He (a camel, and a horse,) flagged, or
became powerless: (K, TA:) or stopped with his
master [or rider] from fatigue. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And
عَطِبَ عَلَيْهِ He was, or became, violently, (O,) or
most violently, (K,) angry with him. (O, K.)
-A2-
العَطْبُ signifies لِينُ القُطْنِ (O, * K) and الصُّوفِ,
(O,) and نُعُومَتُهُ: (K:) you say, عَطَبَ, aor.
عَطُبَ,
(A, O, K,) inf. n. عَطْبٌ and عُطُوبٌ, (O,) It [i. e.
cotton, and wool,] was, or became, soft. (A, O, *

تَعْطِيبٌ, (O, K,) inf. n. of عطّب, (TA,) signifies The brewing (عِلَاج) of beverage, or wine,
in order that its odour may become good: (O, K:)
so says Aboo-Sa'eed. (O.) The phrase رَحِيق
مُعَطَّب occurs in a poem of Lebeed, as some
relate it; but as others relate it, it is مُقَطَّب,
which means “ mixed: ” (O, TA:) so says Az;
and he adds, “I know not what مُعَطَّب is. ”
(TA.)
-A2-  Also, in a grape-vine, The appearing
of the knots, or gems, in the places whence grow

عُطْبٌ and ↓ عُطُبٌ Cotton: (IAar, S, O, K:)
and ↓ عُطْبَةٌ signifies a portion thereof, (S, A, O,
TA,) or of wool. (TA.) [SM says,] In the T,
العطب is said to mean لين القُطْنِ وَالصُّوفِ, [and
so in the O, where it is written العَطْبُ, and said
to be with fet-h,] and its n. un. is عطبة; but I
have found it written with damm [to the ع];
therefore by لين seems to be meant لَيِّن [i. e.
Such as is soft of cotton and of wool: which
I think to be evidently a mistake: see 1].
(TA.)
عَطِبٌ [Perishing, or dying]: see an ex., from
a poet, voce رُبَّ.
عُطُبٌ: see عُطْبٌ.
عُطْبَةٌ: see عُطْبٌ. ―
-b2-  Also A portion of rag by
means of which fire is taken: (K:) or a portion
of burning cotton (S, A, O) or rag: (S, O:) so
in the saying, أَجِدُ رِيحَ عُطْبَةٍ [I perceive the
odour of a portion of burning cotton or rag].
(S, A, O.)
عَوْطَبٌ A calamity, or misfortune: (As, O, K:)
from العَطَبُ [inf. n. of عَطِبَ]. (As, TA.) ―
-b2-
And The main part, or fathomless deep, of the
sea: (As, K:) likewise from العَطَبُ: (As, TA:)
and so عَوْبَطٌ, (K in art. عبط,) formed by transposition: (TA ibid.:) or the deepest place in the
sea: (IAar, O:) or a depressed part between two
