وَتَلْقَحٌ كِشَافًا ثُمَّ تُنْتَجٌ فَتُتْئِمِ
(O) meaning (tropical:)  And it, i. e. war, will fret [or grind
or crush] you, as the mill with its skin put beneath it, upon which the flour falls, frets [or grinds]
the grain; and it, i. e. war, will conceive two
years, one after the other; then bring forth, and

of them to be like the mill's grinding of the

signifies (assumed tropical:)  He put upon him evil (Lh, K, TA)
and misfortune: (K, TA: [the CK has حَمَلَ

and عَرَبِىٌّ: (AA, S, O:) [i. e. عَرَكِىٌّ is the n. un.:]
accord. to the K, عَرَكٌ and عُرُوكٌ are pls. of عَرَكِىٌّ;
but IAth says that عُرُوكٌ is pl. of عَرَكٌ: (TA:)
hence عَرَكٌ is used as meaning sailors, or mariners,
(AA, S, O, K,) because they fish, not as being
[properly] a name for them: (AA, S, O:) Zuheyr
says,
تَغْشَى الحُدَاةُ بِهِمْ حُرَّ الكَثِيبِ كَمَا
يُغْشِى السَّفَائِنَ مَوْجَ اللُّجَّةِ العَرَكُ
[The camel-drivers cover with them the middle of
the elevated expanse of sand like as the seamen
cause the waves of the deep to cover the ships]:
but AO related this verse otherwise, saying مَوْجُ,
in the nom. case, and making العَرَكُ to be an epithet applied to the موج as signifying المُتَلَاطِم [as
though the meaning were, like as the colliding
waves of the deep cover the ships with their surf].

[q. v., app. as meaning The act of leaving camels
amid the pasturage termed حَمْض, to obtain thereof
what they want; a meaning given in the O as an
explanation of ↓ عَرَكْرَكٌ, which is perhaps in this
instance a mistranscription]. (K.)
عَرِكٌ A man who throws down, or prostrates,
his antagonists much, or often; syn. صِرِّيعٌ; (S,
O;) in the K and in some of the copies of the S
صَرِيع, like أَمِير; [which is app. a mistranscription;] (TA;) strong, or vehement, (S, * O, * K,

[in the CK in this latter instance written مُعْرَوْرَكٌ].

time after time, and twice, (TA,) and several
times: (S, O, K:) the noun not being used otherwise than adverbially. (TA.)

عَرْكَانِيَّةٌ; and in the CK, عَرَنِيَّة.])
عَرَكَانِيَّةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
عِرَاكٌ an inf. n. of 3 [q. v.]. (TA.) [Hence,]
one says, أَوْرَدَ إِبِلَهُ العِرَاكَ, (S, O, K,) or, as in the
“ Book ” of Sb, أَرْسَلَهَا العِرَاكَ, (TA,) He made
his camels to come, or go, to the water together;
(S, O, K;) the last word being in the accus. case
after the manner of inf. ns.; (S, O;) originally
عِرَاكًا; then they prefixed ال, which does not
change it from its proper state of an inf. n.: (S,
O, K:) it is like the phrases مَرَرْتُ بِهِمُ الجَمَّآءَ
الغَفِيرَ and الحَمْدَ لِلّٰهِ: (S, O:) IB says that العِرَاكَ
and الجَمَّآءَ الغَفِيرَ are in the accus. case as denotatives of state; and الحَمْدَ لِلّٰهِ as the inf. n.: but
Sb says that they prefix ال to the inf. n. that is
in the place of the denotative of state. (TA.)

عَرِيكَةٌ A camel's hump: or the remainder
thereof: (K:) or عَرِيكَةُ السَّنَامِ signifies what
remains of the hump: (ISk, S, O:) so called
because the purchaser feels that part (يَعْرُكُهُ) to
know the fatness and strength [of the animal]:
(TA:) pl. عَرَائِكُ; which is said by some to signify the humps with the backs. (O.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,
in phrases here following,] (assumed tropical:)  Nature; natural,
native, or innate, disposition or temper or the
like; (S, O, K;) and soul, spirit, or mind. (K.)
One says, فُلَانٌ لَيِّنُ العَرِيكَةِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is easy,
or gentle, (S, O, K, TA,) in natural disposition,
(K, TA,) submissive, tractable; (S, * O, * TA;)
one whose pride, or haughtiness, has been broken,

spirit, incompliant, or resisting: (TA:) and لَانَتْ
عَرِيكَتُهُ His pride, or haughtiness, became broken,
or subdued: (S, O:) originally relating to the
camel; for they used to betake themselves to the
camel when he had the disposition of refusing to
be ridden or mounted, and incompliance, and cut
[a part] in his hump, it being high, difficult to
ride upon; and when this was done, he became
quiet, and was rendered inclinable, and the part
of him that was the place of riding became easy
to sit upon; so one said, قَدْ لَانَتْ عَرِيكَتُهُ (Har
pp. 566-7.) One says also رَجُلٌ مَيْمُونُ العَرِيكَةِ,
meaning [A man fortunate, happy, or blest, in
natural disposition, or] in mind. (TA.)

thou the market; for it is the battle-ground of the
Devil, and in it is set up his banner]: meaning
that it is the dwelling of the Devil, and his place
of alighting to which he repairs and which he
frequents, because of the unlawful doings and the
