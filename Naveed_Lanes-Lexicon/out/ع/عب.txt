عب1
عَبَّ, aor.
عَبُ3َ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,) inf. n. عَبٌّ,
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) He (a man, Msb) drank
water without taking breath: (O, Msb, TA; and
T in art. عنث: [this is the sense in which it is
generally used:]) or he drank water without sipping
or sucking in (مِنْ غَيْرِ مَصٍّ): (S, O:) thus, (S,
O, Msb,) in the manner termed عَبٌّ, (S, O,) i. e.
مِنْ غَيْرِ مَصٍّ, (Msb,) the pigeon drinks water,
like horses and similar beasts; (S, O, Msb;)
whereas other birds take it sip after sip: (Msb:)
or he drank water at once, without interrupting
the swallowing: AA says, the pigeon drinks thus;
differing from the other birds; for these drink by
little and little: (Mgh:) [in like manner also]
Esh-Sháfi'ee says, the pigeon is a bird that drinks
in the manner termed عَبٌّ, and cooes; for it does
not drink like other birds, by little and little:
(TA:) and it is said in a trad. that the livercomplaint (الكُبَاد) is occasioned by drinking in
the manner termed عَبٌّ: (S, O, TA:) or عَبٌّ
signifies [simply] the drinking water: or the
gulping, or swallowing down: or the doing so
uninterruptedly: (K, TA:) or the drinking water
in a single stream, without interruption: (TA:)
and the drinking with the mouth from a place, or
vessel, containing water, not with the hands nor
with a vessel: (K, TA:) you say, عَبَّ فِى المَآءِ,
and فِى الإِنَآءِ, he so drank of the water, and from
the vessel: and [accord. to some] one says of a
bird, عَبَّ; not شَرِبَ: (TA:) [but] Es-Sarakustee
says, one does not say of a bird شَرِبَ المَآءَ, but
حَسَاهُ. (Msb in art. شرب.) ―
-b2-  يَعُبُّ فِيهِ مِيزَابَانِ,
in a trad. respecting the حَوْض [i. e. Mohammad's
pool], as some relate it, means [Two spouts] were
pouring forth into it with an uninterrupted pouring: but accord. to the relation commonly known,
the verb is يغتّ, [i. e. يَغُتُّ in this sense, but
يَغِتُّ in another sense, as meaning the making a
murmuring sound,] with غ and ت. (TA.) ―
-b3-
عَبَّتِ الدَّلْوُ, (K,) [aor., app. تَعِبُّ,] inf. n. عَبٌّ,
(TK,) The bucket made a sound in lading out the
water. (K.) ―
-b4-  And عَبَّ البَحْرُ, inf. n. عُبَابٌ,
The sea rose high, with multitudinous waves. (A.)
[Accord. to Golius, عَبَّ said of the sea means It
had broken waves: but for this he has named no
authority.] ―
-b5-  And [hence,] ↓ عَبَّ عُبَابُهُ (tropical:)  His
speech was continual and abundant. (A.) ―
-b6-
عَبَبٌ [an inf. n., of which the verb, accord. to
general analogy, is app. عَبَّ, first pers. عَبِبْتُ,
aor. يَعَبُّ,] means [The interrupting in swallowing; or] the interrupting the swallowing. (TA.)
-A2-  عَبَّ, [aor., app.,

persisted, in drinking the [beverage called] نَبِيذ.
(Lh, K.) And He swallowed in consecutive
portions the نَبِيذ, (A, TA,) and in large
quantity. (A.)
R. Q. 1
عَبْعَبَ He was put to flight. (O, K.)
R. Q. 2
تَعَبْعَبْتُهُ I took it, or devoured it,
altogether. (O, K.)
عَبُ الشَّمْسِ: see the next paragraph.
-A2-  عَبْ
عَبْ is said when one orders another to conceal
himself. (IAar, TA.)
عَبُّ الشَّمْسِ, (O, K, TA,) as some say, (TA,)
and الشَّمْسِ ↓ عَبُ, (O, K, TA,) which is the form
commonly known and obtaining, (TA,) The
light of the sun: (O, K, TA:) or the light of the
dawn. (Az, TA.) By عَبْشَمْس as a proper name,
is meant عَبْدُ شَمْسٍ: ISh says, among Saad are
بَنُو عَبِ الشَّمْسِ; and among Kureysh, بَنُو عَبْدِ
الشَّمْسِ. (TA.) [See also عَبْءٌ.]
-A2-  عَبُّ قُرٍّ is
for حَبُّ قُرٍّ, meaning Hail. (K in art. حبقر.)
عُبٌّ i. q. رُدْنٌ, (O, K,) which means The base
(أَصْل) of the sleeve: (S and K in art. ردن:) or
the fore part of the sleeve of the shirt: (M in that
art.:) or the lower part thereof: (M in that art.,
and Har pp. 149 and 390:) or the sleeve altogether: (M in that art.:) but, as MF says, it is
a vulgar word. (TA.)
عُبَبٌ The berries (حَبّ) of the كَاكَنَج or
كَاكَنْج [thus differently written, from the Pers.
كَاكْنَجْ], (K,) which, accord. to more than one
of the leading authorities, is a tree, but is expl.
by the author of the K [in its proper art.] as
meaning a gum: (TA:) [what is here meant by
it is the physalis alkekengi, or common wintercherry: accord. to Forskål (Flora Aegypt. Arab
p. cvi.) the name عُبَب is applied to the physalis
somnifera: and also (pp. cxxi. and cxxii. and
163) to the croton lobatum and croton villosum:]
or it is applied by the physicians to the [plant
itself called] كاكنج: (O:) or i. q. عِنَبُ الثَّعْلَبِ;
(IAar, O, K;) which is said by Ibn-Habeeb to
be an incorrect appellation, (O, TA,) being correctly عُبَب, but AM denies that the former is
incorrect: (TA:) or i. q. رَآءٌ; (K;) i. e. the tree
called رَآء: (TA:) or a tree, or plant, (شَجَرَةٌ,) of
the [kind called] أَغْلَاث: (K:) AHn says, on
the authority of Aboo-Ziyád, it is of the أَغْلَاث,
and is a tree, or plant, (شَجَرَةٌ,) resembling the
حَرْمَل [peganum harmala of Linn.], except that
it is taller, coming forth in the form of strings,
and having pods (سِنَفَة) like those of the حَرْمَل,
and sometimes the goats nibble from its leaves and
from its pods when they dry up; it has also
berries, intensely red, like beads of carnelian,
smaller than the نَبِق [or fruit of the lote tree],
and larger than the grape; and people seek out
the leaves thereof that have not been rendered
foraminous, which leaves are then bruised, and
used beneficially as a dressing for maladies attended
with pain: the people assert that the jinn, or
genii, perforate them in envy of mankind. (O.)
عُبُبٌ Waters pouring forth copiously. (IAar,
O, K.) [It may be a pl. of عُبَابٌ (as Golius
says), like as قُرُدٌ is of قُرَادٌ.]
عَبَابِ [a quasi-inf. n., of the class of فَجَارِ and
حَمَادِ, indecl.]. لَا عَبَابِ [app. as used in the
prov. here following] means لَا تَعُبُّ فِى المَآءِ.
(S. [Thus in one of my copies of the S: in the
other copy the explanation is written لَا تَعُبُّ فى
الماء, as though عَبَابِ were an imperative verbal
noun: and so in the O, in which the phrase is
written لَا عَبَابَ: but بَعُبَّ I think a mistranscription.]) The saying إِذَا أَصَابَتِ الظِّبَآءُ المَآءَ فَلَا
عَبَابِ وَإِنْ لَمْ تُصِبْهُ فَلَا أَبَابِ means When the
gazelles find water, they do not drink in the
manner termed عَبٌّ; and when they do not find
it, they do not prepare to seek it and to drink it:
(K, TA; and thus (عَبَابِ and أَبَابِ) accord. to
the Mz, 40th نوع: but in the CK عَبابَ and
اَبابَ:) it is a prov., frequently used by the
Arabs in an abridged manner, لا عباب ولا اباب,
as in the works of Meyd and others; (TA;)
and is applied to a man who turns from a thing,
not needing it. (Meyd.)
عُبَابٌ The main body of a torrent, or flow of
water: and the height and abundance thereof:
(O, K:) or the waves, billows, or surges, thereof:
(K:) and the first portion (O, K) thereof (O) or
of a thing: (K:) and the first and main portion
of water: and the vehemence of running thereof.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] عَبَّ عُبَابُهُ: see 1, near the
end. ―
-b3-  It is said in a trad., إِنَّا حَىٌّ مِنْ مَذْحِجٍ
عُبَابُ شَرَفِهَا وَلُبَابُ سَلَفِهَا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Verily we are
a tribe sprung from Medh-hij, the chief of their
nobility, or nobles, and the purest, or best, issue]
of their ancestry, or [the purest, or best, inheritors]
of their ancestral might and glory. (TA: only
سَلَفِهَا in this saying being there explained.) And
in a trad. of 'Alee, relating to Aboo-Bekr, طِرْتَ
بِعُبَابِهَا وفُزْتَ بِحَبَابِهَا, expl. voce حَبَابٌ. (TA.)
And one says, جَاؤُوا بِعُبَابِهِمْ (assumed tropical:)  They came [with
their whole company, or] all together. (TA.)
-A2-
Also A خُوصَة [or leaf of a palm-tree &c.]. (K.)
عَبِيبَةٌ A certain food, (K,) or sort of food,
(TA,) and a beverage, (K, TA,) obtained (TA)
from the [species of mimosa called] عُرْفُط, of sweet
flavour: (K, TA:) or the exudation [or matter
exuded in the form of drops] of gum; (عرقُ
الصَّمْغِ; [written in the TA without any syll.
signs; in the CK عِرْقُ الصَّمْغِ, and so in my MS.
copy of the K; but in the latter, the former word
has been altered, app. from عَرَقُ, which is evidently the right reading;]) it is of sweet flavour,
and is beaten with [the implement called] a مِجْدَح
until it becomes thoroughly fit for use (حَتَّى يَنْضَجَ),
[app., from what here follows, over a fire,] and
is then drunk: (TA:) or what drops, or distils,
of the exudations (مَغَافِير) of the عُرْفُط: or عَبِيبَةُ
اللَّثَى, accord. to ISk, is the infusion (غُسَالَة) of
لَثًى; (S, TA;) لَثًى being a substance which the
[plant called] ثُمَام exudes, of sweet flavour; what
falls thereof upon the ground is taken, and put
into a garment, or piece of cloth, and water is
poured upon it, and when it flows from the garment, or piece of cloth, it is drunk, in a sweet
state, and sometimes it is made thick; (S;) or
لَثًى is a substance which the ثُمَام exudes, sweet
like نَاطِف [q. v.]; and when any of it flows upon
the ground, it is taken, and put into a vessel, or
sometimes it is poured upon water, and then
drunk, in a sweet state, and sometimes it is made
thick: (TA:) [or عَبِيبَةُ اللَّثَى is a decoction of
the matter exuded by a species of ثُمَام; for] AM
says, I have seen, in the desert, a species of ثُمَام
that exudes a sweet gum, which is gathered from
its shoots, and eaten, and is called لَثَى الثُّمَامِ:
when it has remained for some time, it is found
scattered at the foot of the ثُمَام, and is taken with
its dust, and put into a garment, or piece of cloth,
and cleansed by water poured upon it; then it is
boiled over a fire until it thickens; when it is
eaten: what flows from it [or the fluid part of it]
is called عَبِيبَةٌ: and تَعَبَّبْتُ عَبِيبَةً means “ I
drank عَبِيبَة. ” (L, TA.) It is stated in a marginal note in the L, that A'Obeyd [is related to
have] said that عَبِيبَة is “ milk such as is termed
رَائِب: ” but AM observes that this is a disgraceful
mistake, and that A'Obeyd is related on the
authority of Sh to have assigned this meaning
to غَبِيبَةٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also The [shrub called] رِمْث,
(K, TA,) on which camels feed, (TA,) when it is

عُبَّى A woman of whom a child scarcely ever,
or never, dies. (Kr, K.)
عُبِّيَّةٌ and عِبِّيَّةٌ, (S, O, K, TA,) [like أُبِّيَّةٌ and

the sheddeh to the ب,] also written غُِبِّيَّةٌ, with
غ, (Abu-l-Hasan 'Alee Esh-Shádhilee,) Pride;
haughtiness: (S, O, K:) and glorying. (K.)
One says رَجُلٌ فِيهِ عُِبِّيَّةٌ A man in whom is pride,
or haughtiness. (S, O.) And عُِبِّيَّةُ الجَاهِلِيَّةِ
means The pride, or haughtiness, of the people of
the Time of Ignorance. (S, O.) عُبِّيَّةٌ may be
of the measure فُعْلِيَّةٌ or فُعُّولَةٌ: if the former, from
عُبَابُ المَآءِ, meaning “ the height of water: ” if the
latter, [originally عُبُّويَةٌ,] from عَبَّاهُ, without ء,
meaning “ he prepared it; ” because the proud is
characterized by affectation and preparation. (O.)
عَبَّابٌ [app. One that drinks in the manner
termed عَبٌّ]. بَنُو العَبَّابِ is an appellation of a
people of the Arabs who were thus called because
they intermixed with the Persians so that their
horses drank (عَبَّتْ, K, TA, i. e. شَرِبَتْ, TA) of
the water of the Euphrates. (K, * TA.)
عَبْعَبٌ The softness, tenderness, bloom, or flourishing freshness, of youth. (S, O, K.) ―

A buck-gazelle. (S, O.) ―
-b4-  عَبْعَبُ التَّصْوِيرِ means
Bulky in form, big (جَلِيل) in speech. (TA.
[But the addition “ big in speech ” is app. a
mistake, occasioned by an omission or a transposition: see عَبْعَابٌ.]) ―
-b5-  See also another meaning voce عَبْعَابٌ. ―
-b6-  And العَبْعَبُ, (O, K, TA,)
not a mistranscription for الغبغب, (O,) but
sometimes pronounced with غ, (TA,) is the name
of A certain idol, (O, K, TA,) belonging to
Kudá'ah (O, TA) and those dwelling near to
them. (TA.) And The place of the idol [app. of

A man having an ample throat and chest, big

-b3-  And A youth, or
or young man, (TA,) or an ass, (O, [in which
this application is confirmed by the citation of a
verse wherein the epithet is evidently applied to
a swift beast such as the wild ass,]) full-grown,
and goodly in make. (O, K, TA.)
عُنْبَبٌ Abundance of water. (IAar, O, K.
[See also عُبَابٌ.]) The ن is said by AM [and in
the O] to be augmentative. (TA.) [But it is
also mentioned in the K in art. عنب.] ―
-b2-  And

عنب;) as also عُنْبُبٌ. (So in some copies of the

that takes long, or wide, steps, (K,) in running,
or that runs far. (K accord. to different copies.)
[Golius, who writes the word يُعْبُوبٌ, gives
among its significations that of A locust that
leaps far or rapidly, as from the K; in a copy of
which he probably found جَرَاد written by mistake
for جَرَاد.] ―
-b3-  It is also used as an epithet meaning Long, in the saying of Kuss,
عَذْقٌ بِسَاحَةِ حَائِرٍ يَعْبُوبِ
