final sequel or result: (A, O, K:) or the former
verb has an intensive signification: (Msb:) and
تَعْبِيرٌ has a more particular [or more restricted]
meaning than تَأْوِيلٌ: it is said to be from عَبَرَ
الكِتَابَ [q. v.]; or, as some say, it is from عِبْرٌ
signifying the “ side ” of a river, because the interpreter of the dream considers the two sides
thereof, and meditates upon every particular of it
from its beginning to its end. (TA.) In the
phrase of the Kur [xii. 43], إِنْ كُنْتُمْ لِلرُّؤْيَا
↓ تَعْبُرُونَ, the ل is termed لَامُ التَّعْقِيبِ [the ل of
succedaneousness], because it is succedaneous to
the connection termed إِضَافَة [i. e. the phrase is
succedaneous to إِنْ كُنْتُمْ عَابِرِى الرُّؤْيَا If ye be
interpreters of the dream]: (O, TA:) or it is

O, * Msb) And عبّر عَنْهُ غَيْرُهُ Another spoke, or
spoke out, or explained, for him; (L, K, * TA;)
he (the latter) being unable to say what he
would. (L, TA.) And عَبَّرْتُ عَنْ فُلَانٍ I spoke
for such a one. (S, O, Msb.) [Hence, يُعَبِّرُ
عَنْ كَذَا, said of a word or phrase, It expresses
the meaning of, signifies, or denotes, such a thing.
And يُعَبَّرُ بِهِ عَنْ كَذَا The meaning of such a

عَلَى مَلَقِيَّاتٍ يُعَبِّرْنَ بالغُفْرِ
[Upon swiftly-running mares that show the mountain kids, in the swiftness of their pace, what
makes their eyes to weep from envy]. (TA.)
And you say also, عبّر عَيْنَيْهِ, meaning He made
his eyes to weep. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also He destroyed
him: (K, TA:) as though he showed him what
would make his eye to weep, or make it hot.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And He caused him to fall into difficulty, or distress. (A.) And It (an affair, or
event,) was, or became, difficult, or distressing, to
him. (O, K.)
8
اعتبر He became admonished, or reminded;
he took warning, or example: in this sense the
verb is used in the Kur lix. 2: and you say,
اِعْتَبَرَ بِمَا مَضَى He became admonished or reminded, or he took warning or example, by what
passed: (Msb:) and السَّعِيدُ مِنَ اعْتَبَرَ بِغَيْرِهِ
وَالشَّقِىُّ مَنِ اعْتَبَرَ بِهِ غَيْرُهُ [The fortunate is he who
takes warning by others, and the unfortunate is
he by whom others take warning]. (Kull p. 60.)
And عَبَرٌ [as inf. n. of ↓ عَبِرَ, aor.
عَبَرَ,] signifies the
same as اِعْتِبَارٌ [as inf. n. of اِعْتَبَرَ in the sense expl.
above]: (Fr, O, L, K, TA:) whence the saying
of the Arabs, اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْنَا مِمَّنْ يَعْبَرُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَا
يَعْبُرُهَا, (Fr, O, L, TA,) with fet-h to the ب of
يعبر in the first case, and with damm to it in the
second case, (TA,) meaning O God, make us to
be of those who take warning, or example, by the
present world, and do not [pass through it or] die
quickly, or soon, until they content Thee by
obedience: (Fr, O, L, TA:) in the copies of the
K, مِمَّنْ يَعْبُرُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَا يَعْمُرُهَا, the former verb
with ب [and damm], and the latter with م [and
damm]: and in the A is given, as a trad., اُعْبُرُوا
الدُّنْيَا وَلَا تَعْمُرُوهَا: but the reading given by Sgh
and in the L is pronounced by MF to be the
right. (TA.) See also عِبْرَةٌ. [And see 10, last
sentence.] ―
-b2-  Also He took, or regarded, what
he witnessed, or saw, or beheld, as an indication,
or evidence, of what was concealed from him:
(O:) he compared what was unapparent with
what was apparent [and so judged of the former
from analogy]: or he considered the essential
properties of things, and their modes of indication,
in order that, by the consideration thereof, another
thing, of their kind, might become known. (Kull
p. 60.) See, again, عِبْرَةٌ. Ibn-Seereen used to
say, أَعْتَبِرُ الحَدِيثَ [I judge by comparison with
what has been transmitted by tradition from the
Prophet]; meaning I interpret a dream according to what has been transmitted by tradition,
like as I do according to the Kur-án; as when a
crow is interpreted as meaning an unrighteous
man, and a rib as meaning a woman, in imitation of forms of speech used by the Prophet.
(O, * TA.) ―
-b3-  See also 1, latter half, in two
places. ―
-b4-  Also He accounted, or esteemed, or
regarded, a thing, in respect of predicamental
order. (Msb.) See, again, عِبْرَةٌ. ―
-b5-  [And He
esteemed a person, or thing; held him, or it, in
high estimation or regard. ―
-b6-  And He took a
thing into account, regarded it, or included it in a
mental view or an examination. Hence the
phrase بِاعْتِبَارِ كَذَا With regard, or respect, or
with regard had, to such a thing; in consideration
of such a thing, or of the implication thereof;
and having regard, or respect, to such a thing;
as also اِعْتِبَارًا لِكَذَا and بِكَذَا. And بِاعْتِبَارٍ وَاحِدٍ
Considered in one respect; in one and the same
light. Hence also the phrase,] يُعْتَبَرُ كَذَا لِصِحَّةِ
العَقْدِ Such a thing is made a condition [or is taken
into account] for the soundness, or validity, of the contract. (Msb.) ―
-b7-  اعتبر مِنْهُ means He wondered
at him, or it. (K, TA. In the CK, منه is

thou hast hastened] thy drawing forth of the dirhems. (O.)
-A3-  See also 1, last quarter, in two
places. ―

with اعتبر in the first of the senses assigned to
the latter above; but for this I do not find any
authority.]
