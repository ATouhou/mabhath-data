عمت1
عَمَتَ, aor.
عَمِتَ, (T, K,) inf. n. عَمْتٌ; (T, S,
O;) and ↓ عمّت, (O, K,) inf. n. تَعْمِيتٌ; (O;)
He wound wool (S, O, * K) in an oblong form,
(TA,) or in a round form, (S, O, K,) like a ring,
(TA,) for the purpose of its being put in the hand
and spun (S, O, K) with the spindle: (TA:) or
he wound soft hair of the camel, and wool, into
the form of a ring, and spun it, putting it in his
hand: (T, TA:) the operation termed عَمْتٌ is
performed after beating, and separating and
loosening, the wool, and collecting it together, in
order to wind it upon the hand, and spin it with
the spindle. (AHeyth, TA.) An ex. of the
former verb occurs in a verse cited voce رَاجِلَةٌ.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And the former verb signifies also He
twisted a rope of [the species of trefoil, or clover,
called] قَتّ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And it is said in the K
that عَمَتَ فُلَانًا means He overcame, or subdued,
such a one, and made him to refrain, or restrained
him; expl. by قَهَرَهُ وَكَفَّهُ: but [SM says that]
the correct reading is probably وَلَفَّهُ; for in the L
[and in the O, app. on the authority of Az, to
whom the same is ascribed in the TA in art. لف]
we find what here follows: فُلَانٌ يَعْمِتُ أَقْرَانَهُ
means يَقْهَرُهُمْ وَيَلُفُّهُمْ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Such a one overcomes,
or subdues, and throws into confusion, his antagonists: and hence, app., what is said in the
K; the author of which probably found يَكُفَّهُمْ
erroneously written for يَلُفُّهُمْ in some lexicon, and
therefore thought it allowable to make عَمَتَ in
this case to have a sing. for its objective complement]: and it is added that this is said in
relation to war, and excellence of judgment, and
knowledge of the case of the enemy, and the subduing him with the infliction of many wounds.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  عَمَتَهُ also signifies He beat him with a
staff, or stick, not caring [for any one]. (K.)

عَمَّتَ see the first sentence above.
عَمِيتٌ A twisted rope of [the species of trefoil,
or clover, called] قَتّ; as also ↓ مَعْمُوتٌ. (TA.)
―
-b2-  See also what next follows.
عَمِيتَةٌ A portion of wool, (S, * O, * K,) or of the
soft hair of the camel, (S, O,) wound in the
manner described in the first sentence of this art.;
(S, O, K;) like a سَبِيخَة of cotton, and a سَلِيلَة
of [goats'] hair, (S, O, TA,) or a فَلِيلَة of [goats']
hair: (ISd, TA:) the pl. [of pauc.] is أَعْمِتَةٌ and
[of mult.] عُمُتٌ [and coll. gen. n., improperly
called a pl.,] ↓ عَمِيتٌ; (K;) or, accord. to ISd,
أَعْمِتَةٌ is pl. of عَمِيتٌ, which is pl. of عَمِيتَةٌ;
(TA;) and عَمَائِتُ is a pl. of this last. (AHeyth,
TA.)
عِمِّيتٌ A clever, or an intelligent, watcher, or
guardian: (S, O, K:) or a knowing, intelligent,
keeper, or preserver, or guardian: (Az, TA:)
and a clever, or an intelligent, and a bold, man.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And (some say, S, O) Ignorant and
weak. (S, O, K.) ―
-b3-  And (some say, O) Drunken:
(O, K:) and who cannot go aright, or knows not
the course, or way, that he would pursue: (K:)
which last explanation and that which immediately precedes it (i. e. “ drunken ”) appear,
from the L and other lexicons, to be one signification. (TA.) The pl. is عَمَامِيتُ. (S, O.)
مَعْمُوتٌ: see عَمِيتٌ.
