عَبُدَ, inf. n. عِبَادَةٌ (IKtt, L, Msb,

or he obeyed God with humility or submissiveness;

God approved: and, inf. n. عُبُودَةٌ, he approved
what God did: (see the former of these ns. below:)] the verb is used in these senses only when
the object is God, or a false god, or the Devil.
(TA.)
-A2-  عَبَدْتُ بِهِ أُوذِيهِ I was excited against

-A3-  عَبُدَ, aor.
عَبُدَ, inf. n.
عُبُودَةٌ and عُبُودِيَّةٌ, accord. to Lh and IKtt, but
A'Obeyd held that there is no verb to these two
ns., He was, or became, a slave, or in a state of
slavery: or he was, or became, in a state of
slavery, his fathers having been so before him; as
also ↓ عُبِّدَ. (L.) ―
-b2-  Lth read [in the Kur v. 65]
وَعَبُدَ الطَّاغُوتُ; explaining the meaning to be,
Et-Tághoot having become an object of worship;
and saying that عَبُدَ, here, is a verb similar to
ظَرُفَ and فَقُهَ: but Az says that in this he has
committed a mistake. (L.)
-A4-  عَبِدَ, aor.
عَبَدَ, inf. n.
عَبَدٌ (and عَبَدَةٌ, or this is a simple subst., L), He
was, or became, angry; (Fr, S, O, * L, Msb, K;)
[and so ↓ تعبّد, in the Deewán of Jereer, accord.
to Freytag;] like أَبِدَ and أَمِدَ and أَحِنَ: (Fr:)
and he was long angry. (L.) You say, عَبِدَ عَلَيْهِ
He was angry with him. (Fr.) And ElFarezdak makes it trans. without a prep., saying
يَعْبَدُنِى. (L.) ―
-b2-  He disdained, or scorned. (AZ,
S, O, L.) El-Farezdak says,
وَأَعْبَدُ أَنْ أَهْجُو كُلَيْبًا بِدَارِمِ
[And I disdain to satirize Kuleyb with Dárim:
the former being unworthy to be coupled with the
latter even as an object of satire]. (S, O, L.)

He made me to posses such a one as a slave: (A,
O, Msb, K:) so accord. to Lth: but Az says
that the meaning of أَعْبَدْتُ فُلَانًا as commonly

assigned by Lth if it can be verified. (L.)

and took possession of him by force. (L.) ―

(namely, a man,) subdued him, or rendered him
submissive, so that he did the work of slaves. (AZ,
TA.) عبّد, inf. n. as above, is syn. with ذَلَّلَ. (S,

of its pass. part. n. below. ―

R. Q. 2
تَعَبْدَدُوا They (a people) went away
in parties in every direction. (TA.) [See
عَبَادِيدُ.]
عَبْدٌ, originally an epithet, but used as a subst.,
(Sb, TA,) A male slave; (S, A, O, L, Msb, K;)
i. q. مَمْلُوكٌ; (L, K;) [but عَبْدٌ is now generally
applied to a male black slave; and مَمْلُوكٌ, to a
male white slave; and this distinction has long
obtained;] contr. of حُرٌّ; (S, A, O, L, Msb;) as
also ↓ عَبْدَلٌ, (L, K,) in which the ل is augmentative: (L:) and a servant, or worshipper, of
God, and of a false god, or of the Devil: (Lth,
L, &c.:) [you say عَبْدُ اللّٰهِ and عَبْدُ الشَّمْسِ &c.:
see also عَابِدٌ, which signifies the same; and see
the remarks in this paragraph on the pls. عَبِيدٌ
and عِبَادٌ and عَبَدَةٌ &c.:] and a man, or human
being; (M, A, L, K;) as being a bondman
(مَرْبُوبٌ) to his Creator; (L;) applied to a male
and to a female; (Ibn-Hazm, TA;) whether free
or a slave: (K:) pl. أَعْبُدٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and
أَعْبِدَةٌ and أَعْبَادٌ, (IKtt, TA,) [all pls. of pauc.,]
of which the first is the most commonly known,
(Msb,) and ↓ عَبِيدٌ and عِبَادٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,)
which two and the first are the most commonly
known of all the many pls. of عَبْدٌ, (Msb,) عَبِيدٌ
being like كَلِيبٌ as pl. of كَلْبٌ, a rare form of
pl.; (S, O;) or, accord. to some, it is a quasipl. n.; accord. to Ibn-Málik, فَعِيلٌ occurs as a
pl. measure, but sometimes they use it in the
manner of a pl. and make it fem., as in the instance of عَبِيدٌ, and sometimes they use it in the
manner of quasi-pl. ns. and make it masc., as in
the instances of حَجِيجٌ and كَلِيبٌ; (MF;)
[accord. to the general and more approved
opinion, it is a quasi-pl. n., and therefore fem.
and masc., but most commonly fem.;] and further
it should be remarked that the common people
agree in making a difference between عَبِيدٌ and
عِبَادٌ, by the former meaning slaves [and by the
latter meaning servants of God and also simply,
with the article ال, mankind], saying, هٰؤُلَآءِ عَبِيدٌ
these are slaves, and هٰذَا عَبْدٌ مِنْ عِبَادِ اللّٰهِ [this is
a servant, of the servants of God]: (Az, L:) [and
a distinction is also made between عِبَادٌ and عَبَدَةٌ,
respecting which see what follows:] other pls. of
عَبْدٌ are عُبْدَانٌ, (S, O, K,) like تُمْرَانٌ pl. of تَمْرٌ,
(S, O,) and عِبْدَانٌ, (S, O, K,) like جِحْشَانٌ pl. of
جَحْشٌ, (S, O,) and عُبُدٌ, (S, O, K,) like سُقُفٌ pl.
of سَقْفٌ, (S, O,) or this is pl. of عَبِيدٌ, like رُغُفٌ
pl. of رَغِيفٌ, (Zj,) and is also a pl. of عَابِدٌ, (L,)
and some read [in the Kur v. 65] عُبُدَ الطَّاغُوتِ,
(Akh, S, O,) and عُبْدٌ (MF) and عُبُودٌ and عُبَّدٌ
and عُبَّادٌ and عَبَدَةٌ, (IKtt, TA,) the last three of
which are also pls. of عَابِدٌ: (L:) one says of the
worshippers of a plurality of gods, هُمْ عَبَدَةُ
الطَّاغُوتِ [they are the servants of Et-Tághoot];
but the Muslims one calls عِبَادُ اللّٰهِ, meaning the
servants, or worshippers, of God: (Lth, L:) [all
these are pls. in the proper sense of the term, of
the broken class:] and عَبْدُونَ, (O, K,) a pl. of
the sound class, adopted because عَبْدٌ is originally
an epithet: (TA:) and [the following, with the
exception of the first, and of some which are particularized as being pls. of pls., are also said to
be pls., but are properly speaking quasi-pl. ns.,
namely,] ↓ عَبُدٌ, (O, K,) accord. to some, who
read [in the Kur ubi suprà] عَبُدَ الطَّاغُوتِ, making
the former a prefixed noun, as meaning the servants (خَدَم) of Et-Tághoot; but it is a n. of
the measure فَعُلٌ, like حَذُرٌ and نَدُسٌ, not a pl.;
the meaning being the servant (خَادِم) of Et-
Tághoot; (Akh, S, O;) and it is also used by
poetic license for عَبْدٌ; (Fr, T, S, O;) and ↓ عِبِدَّانٌ
and ↓ عِبِدَّآءُ and ↓ عِبِدَّى; (S, O, K;) or, accord.
to some, the last of these signifies slaves born in a
state of slavery; and the female is termed ↓ عَبْدَةٌ;
and Lth says that ↓ عِبِدَّى signifies a number of
slaves born in a state of slavery, generation after
generation; but Az says that this is a mistake,
that عِبِدَّى اللّٰهِ signifies the same as عبَادُ اللّٰهِ, that
it is thus used in a trad., and that عِبِدَّى is applied
in another trad. to poor men of the class called
أَهْلُ الصُّفَّة; (L;) and ↓ عُبُدَّآءُ and ↓ عِبِدَّةٌ and
↓ عِبَادٌّ (IKtt, TA) and ↓ مَعْبَدَةٌ, like مَشْيَخَةٌ, (T,
O, K,) and ↓ مَعْبُودَآءُ (Yaakoob, S, O, K) and
↓ مَعْبُودَى, (IKtt, TA,) and [pl. pl.] ↓ مَعَابِدُ, (O,
K,) said to be pl. of مَعْبَدَةٌ; (TA;) and pl. pl.
أَعَابِدُ, (K,) pl. of أَعْبُدٌ; (TA;) and عَبِيدُونَ,
(Es-Suyootee, MF,) app. pl. of ↓ عَبِيدٌ. (MF.)
فَادْخُلِى فِى عِبَادِى, in the Kur lxxxix. 29, means
Then enter thou among my righteous servants:
(Ksh, Bd, Jel:) or it means فِى حِزْبِى [among
my peculiar party]. (S, O.) ―
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  Ignoble,
or base-born; like as حُرٌّ is used to signify
“ generous,” “ noble,” or “ well-born. ” (Mgh in
art. حر.)
-A2-  Also A certain plant, of sweet odour,
(O, K, TA,) of which the camels are fond because
it makes the milk to become plentiful, and fattens;
it is sharp, or hot, (حَادّ O, or حَارّ TA,) in temperament; and when they depasture it they become thirsty, and seek the water: (O, TA:) so
says IAar. (O.)
-A3-  And A short and broad
نَصْل [or arrow-head, or spear-head, or blade].
(AA, O, * K.)
عَبَدٌ: see عَابِدٌ.
عَبُدٌ: see the paragraph commencing with عَبْدٌ,
latter half.
عَبِدٌ and ↓ عَابِدٌ (but the latter is rarely used,
Ibn-'Arafeh) Angry. (L.) And (both words)
Disdaining, or disdainful; scorning, or scornful.
(L.) Accord. to AA, العَابِدِينَ in the words of
the Kur [xliii. 81], إِنْ كَانَ لِلرَّحْمٰنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَا أَوَّلُ
↓ العَابِدِينَ, means The disdainers, or scorners, and
the angry: (S, * L:) but Ibn-'Arafeh rejects this
assertion: (TA:) these words are variously explained; as meaning There is not to the Compassionate a son; and I am the first of the angry
disdainers or scorners of the assertion that there
is: or, and I am the first of the deniers of this
assertion: or, and I am the first of the worshippers of God according to the unitarian doctrine,
or, of the worshippers of God of this people: or
if there were to the Compassionate a son, I would
be the first of his worshippers: or if there be to
the Compassionate a son, I am the first of worshippers; but I am not the first worshipper of
God: or, accord. to Az, the best interpretation
is one ascribed to Mujáhid; i. e. if there be to
the Compassionate a son in your opinion, I am
the first of those who have worshipped God alone,
and who have thus charged you with uttering a
falsehood in this your assertion. (L.)
عَبْدَةٌ: see عَبْدٌ, latter half.
عَبَدَةٌ [as a subst. from عَبِدَ (q. v.), Anger. ―

fatness]. (S, O.) And one says [also] نَاقَةٌ عَبَدَةٌ
[if this be not a mistake for the phrase here next
preceding] meaning A strong she-camel. (L, Msb.)
―
-b5-  And Lastingness, or continuance; syn. بَقَآءٌ;
(O, L, K, TA;) in some lexicons نَقَآءٌ; (TA;)

meaning There is not to thy garment any lastingness, or continuance, and strength. (Lh, L.)
