Msb, K) and

aor. the more chaste, (O,) means Thy doing so
distressed, or hath distressed, or afflicted, me;
or, emphatically, distresses, or afflicts, me; syn.
اِشْتَدَّ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, TA,) and حَقَّ, (S,
O, K, TA,) and شَقَّ: (TA:) a phrase [often,
but not always,] alluding to a loathing of the
action, or indignation thereat. (Msb.) In like
manner also you say, عَزَّ عَلَىَّ كَذَا Such a thing
distressed, or afflicted, me. (S.) And عَزَّ عَلَىَّ أَنْ
أَسُوْءَكَ It distressed, or afflicted, me to displease thee.
(A.) And عَزَّ مَا أَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ, like حَقَّ أَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ
[or حَقَّ مَا انّك ذاهب, meaning It is distressing
that thou art going away]. (TA.) And one
says to a man, Dost thou love me? and he replies, لَعَزَّ مَا, i. e., لَشَدَّ مَا, (A, O, K,) and لَحَقَّ مَا,
(A, TA,) meaning It distresses me, what thou
sayest; or it has distressed me. (TK.) You say
also, بِمَا أَصَابَكَ ↓ أُعْزِزْتُ I was, or am, distressed
by what befell, or hath befallen, thee. (S, O, K.)
And عَلَىَّ بِمَا أُصِبْتَ بِهِ ↓ أَعْزِزْ That by which thou

أَبَا مُحَمَّدٍ أَنْ أَرَاكَ مُجَدَّلًا تَحْتَ نُجُومِ السَّمَآءِ [It
distresses me, or how doth it distress me! O Aboo-Mohammad, that I see thee prostrated upon the
ground beneath the stars of heaven]. (TA.) [A
similar ex. is given in the A; without بِ prefixed
to أَنْ.]
-A2-  عَزَّ also signifies He was, or became,
weak: thus having two contr. meanings. (Msb.)
-A3-  عَزَّهُ, aor.
عَزُ3َ, (S, A, O, K,) inf. n. عَزٌّ, (S, O,
TA,) He overcame him, or conquered him: (S,
A, O:) he overcame him in argumentative contest; (K, * TA;) as also ↓ عَزْعَزَهُ, (K,) inf. n. عَزْعَزَةٌ;
(TA;) and so عَزَّهُ فِى الخِطَابِ: (Jel in xxxviii.
22, and TA:) or this last signifies he became
stronger than he therein; (TA;) or he strove with
him to overcome therein; as also فِيهِ ↓ عازّهُ, (S,
K,) inf. n. مُعَازَّةٌ: (O, TA:) in the Kur xxxviii.
22, some read عَزَّنِى; and others, ↓ عَازَّنِى: and
you say, فَعَزَزْتُهُ ↓ عَازَّنِى, meaning, he strove with
me to overcome, and I overcame him: and مُعَازَّةٌ
signifies the contending together in argument:
(TA:) you say also of a horse, فَارِسَهُ ↓ اعتزّ [he
overcame his rider, or gained the mastery over
him]. (S and K in art. جمع.) It is said in a
prov., (S,) مَنْ عَزَّ بَزَّ He who overcomes takes the
spoil. (S, A, O, K.) And in another prov., (S,)
إِذَا عَزَّ أَخُوكَ فَهُنْ (Th, S, O, K) When thy brother
overcomes thee, and thou art not equal to him
(لَمْ تُقَاومْهُ) be thou gentle to him: (Az, O, K,
TA:) or when thy brother magnifies and exalts
himself against thee, abase thyself: (Th, TA:)
or, accord. to Aboo-Is-hák, what Th says is a
mistake; the right reading being فَهِنْ, with kesr,
and the meaning, when thy brother is hard, or
severe, to thee, treat thou him with gentleness, or
blandishment; not فَهُنْ, with damm, which is
from الهَوَانُ: but ISd approves and justifies the
reading given by Th. (TA.) [See also 10.]

أَفْضَلُ. (ISd.) [But see what follows.] ―
-b2-  ↓ العُزَّى
was the name of A certain idol, (S, O, K,) belonging to Kureysh and Benoo-Kináneh: (S, O,
TA:) or a certain gum-acacia-tree, (سَمُرَةٌ,) which
the tribe of Ghatafán (S, O, K) the son of Saad
the son of Keys-'Eilán (TA) used to worship; (S,
O, K;) the first who took it as an object of worship was Dhálim the son of As' ad; above Dhát-
'Irk, nine miles towards El-Bustán, (O, K, TA,)
at [the valley called] En-Nakhleh Esh-Shámeeyeh,
(O, TA,) near Mekkeh; or, as some say, at Et-
Táïf: (TA:) he, (K,) Dhálim, (O,) or they, (S,)
built over it a house, (S, O, K) and named it
بُسّ, (O, K,) accord. to Ibn-El-Kelbee; or, accord.
to others, بُسَّآء; (TA;) and they appointed to it
ministers, (S, TA,) like those of the Kaabeh;
(TA;) and they used to hear in it a voice: (O,
K, TA:) but Mohammad sent to it Khálid Ibn-El-Weleed, (S, O, K,) in the year of the conquest
[of Mekkeh], (O, TA,) and he demolished the
house, (S, K,) and slew the [chief] minister,
(TA,) and burned the gum-acacia-tree: (S, O,
K:) or, as is related on the authority of I'Ab, a
certain she-devil, who used to come to three gumacacia-trees (سَمُرَات) in Batn-Nakhleh, against
whom Mohammad, when he conquered Mekkeh,
sent Khálid Ibn-El-Weleed; and he cut down
the trees, and slew her and her minister. (TA.)
A poet says,
أَمَا وَدِمَآءٍ مَائِرَاتٍ تَخَالُهَا
عَلَى قُنَّةِ العُزَّى وَبِالنَّسْرِ عَنْدَمَا
[Verily, or now surely, by bloods flowing, and
running hither and thither, which thou wouldst
think to be dragon's-blood, upon the mountain-top
of El-' Ozzà, and by En-Nesr]. (S.) ISd says,
I hold ↓ العُزَّى to be fem. of الأَعَزُّ; and if so, the
ال in the former is not redundant, but is like the
ال in الحَارِثُ and العَبَّاسُ: but properly it should
be redundant, because we have not heard العُزَّى
as an epithet [of excess] like as we have heard
الصُّغْرَى and الكُبْرَى. (L, TA.) ―
-b3-  ↓ عُزَّى is
[however] used in the sense of عَزِيزَةٌ: (K, TA:)
and أَعَزُّ [fem. عَزَّآءُ] is also syn. with عَزِيزٌ, which
see in four places. (S, K.)
المُعِزُّ, as a name of God, He who giveth عِزّ [or
might, &c.] to whomsoever He will, of his servants.
(TA.)
مَعَزَّةٌ [accord. to analogy signifies A cause, or
means, of عِزّ i. e. might, &c.]: see ظَفَارِ.
إِنَّكُمْ مُعَزَّزٌ بِكُمْ Verily ye are treated with hardness, severity, or rigour; not with indulgence. (S,
O, TA.) From a trad. of Ibn-'Omar. (O, TA.)
فُلَانٌ مِعْزَازٌ المَرَضِ Such a one is in a severe
state of disease. (S, O, K.)
مَعْزُوزَةٌ, applied to land, or ground, (أَرْضٌ, S, O,)
Hard, or firm; syn. شَدِيدَةٌ. (S, O, K.) ―
-b2-
And, so applied, Rained upon (O, K, TA) by
rain such as is termed عِزّ, and rendered compact,
or coherent, and hard; as also ↓ عَزَازَةٌ and ↓ عَزَّآءُ.
(TA.)
مُعْتَزٌّ is syn. with مُسْتَعِزٌّ. (TA.) You say, أَنَا
مُعْتَزٌّ بِبَنِى فُلَانٍ and بِهِمْ ↓ مُسْتَعِزٌّ [I reckon myself
strong by means of the sons of such a one]. (A.)
―
-b2-  فَرَسٌ مُعْتَزَّةٌ A mare having thick and strong
flesh. (TA.)
مُسْتَعِزٌّ :see the next preceding paragraph.
