عشق1
عَشِقَ, aor.
عَشَقَ, (S, O, Msb, K, [accord. to the
TA, said in the Msb to be like ضَرَبَ, but in my
copy of the Msb it is correctly said to be of the
class of تَعِبَ,]) inf. n. عِشْقٌ and عَشَقٌ, (S, O, K,)
the latter mentioned by Fr, and said by Ibn-EsSarráj to be thus by poetic license, and with two
fet-hahs because two kesrehs are rare in nouns,
(S, O,) or the former is a simple subst., and the
latter is the inf. n., (Msb,) [and app. مَعْشَقٌ also,]
He loved (another, S, O, K) excessively; (IF, S,
O, Msb, K;) [or passionately; or with amorous
desire; or, agreeably with explanations of عِشْقٌ
below, admiringly; or with blindness to defects in
the object of his love; or with a disease of the
nature of melancholia;] and ↓ تعشّق as trans. is
syn. with عَشِقَ as such. (TA.) [See also عَاشِقٌ.]
―
-b2-  And عَشِقَتْ said of a she-camel, She was, or
became, vehemently desirous of the stallion. (AA,
TA.) ―
-b3-  And عَشِقَ بِهِ He, or it, stuck to him, or
it; (O, K;) as also عَسِقَ به. (O.)
2
عشّقهُ is used in the present day as meaning
He made him to be affected with عِشْق; but is
probably post-classical.]
5
تعشّق He affected عِشْق: (S, O, K: * [in the
K, تعشّقهُ, in which the pronoun app. refers to
العِشْق, is erroneously put for تعشّق:]) or he
showed, or exhibited, عِشْق. (KL.) And He was,
or became, عَاشِق. (KL.)
-A2-  See also 1.
عِشْقٌ (IF, S, O, Msb, K) [generally held to be
an inf. n.] and ↓ مَعْشَقٌ [likewise app. an inf. n.]
(O, K) Excessive love; (IF, S, O, Msb, K;) [or
passionate love; or amorous desire:] or attackment to women: (IF, Msb:) or the lover's
admiration (عَجَب [for عُجْبُ in the CK is a
mistranscription for عَجَبُ]) of the beloved; and
it may be in chasteness and in immorality; (K;)
or عِشْقٌ may be in chasteness and حُبٌّ may be in
immorality: (TA:) or blindness of the sense to the
faults, or defects, of the beloved: or a disease of
the nature of melancholia (مَرَضٌ وَسْوَاسِىٌّ), which
one procures to himself by making his thought to
exercise absolute power over the approval of certain forms: (K:) Th, being asked respecting
الحُبّ and العِشْق, which of them is the more
commendable, said, الحُبّ, because in العِشْق is
excess: (TA:) [see also حُبٌّ:] Ibn-Seenà, [whom
we commonly call Avicenna,] in a treatise on
العِشْق, [regarding it as meaning natural propension,] says that it is not peculiar to the human
species, but pervades all existing things of the
celestial and the elemental and the vegetable and
the mineral and the animal, and that its meaning
is not perceived nor known, and is rendered more
obscure by explanation thereof: (MF, TA:) it is
said in the A that العِشْق is derived from العَشَقَةُ,
which means the [plant commonly called] لَبْلَاب,
because it twines upon trees, and cleaves to them.
(TA.)
عَشَقٌ The لَبْلَاب [a species of dolichos, the dolichos lablab of Linn.]; one of which is called عَشَقَةٌ:
IDrd says, the [common] people assert that the
عَشَقَة is the لَبْلَابَة: (O:) accord. to Zj, (TA,)
عَشَقَةٌ signifies a certain tree [or plant] that becomes green, and then becomes slender and yellow:
(K, TA:) and عَشَقٌ is its pl. [or rather the coll.
gen. n.]: (K:) and Kr says that with the postclassical authors it is the لَبْلَات. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also
The [tree called] أَرَاك. (TA.)
عُشُقٌ, with two dammehs, A camel that keeps
to the female which he covers and which desires
none but him. (IAar, TA.)
-A2-  And Men who
trim, or dress, or put into a good or right state,
the sets [so I render غُرُوس, as pl. accord. to general analogy of غَرْسٌ,] of sweet-smelling plants.
(IAar, O, K.)
عَشِيقٌ i. q. عَاشِقٌ, q. v. (TA.) ―
-b2-  عَشِيقُ العُلَى
is a metaphorical expression like خَدِينُ العُلَى
[meaning Excessive lover of eminence]. (TA in
art. خدن.)
-A2-  Also i. q. ↓ مَعْشُوقٌ [Loved excessively, &c.]. (TA.)
عِشِّيقٌ Affected with much عِشْق; (ISk, S, O, K;)
applied to a man. (ISk, S, O.)
عَشِيقٌ Loving excessively; [or passionately;] &c.;
(Msb, K;) [or an excessive, or a passionate, lover;]
as also ↓ عَاشِقَةٌ: (TA:) the former applied to a
man and to a woman, (Msb, K,) and عَاشِقَةٌ also
is applied to a woman, (K:) they said اِمْرَأَةٌ عَاشِقٌ
لِزَوْجِهَا [A woman excessively, or passionately,
loving to her husband]; (Fr, S, O;) and sometimes they said عَاشِقَةٌ: (O:) pl. عُشَّاقٌ (TA)
[and عُشَّقٌ, mentioned in the O as an epithet
applied to eyes (عُيُون), by Ru-beh]: it is asserted
that the عَاشِق is thus called from العَشَقَةُ meaning
the لَبْلَابَة, because of his becoming dried up: (O,
TA:) or from عَشِقَ بِهِ, because of his cleaving to
the object of his love. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] عَاشِقُ
الأَبْكَارِ an appellation of The insect called حُرْقُوص
[q. v.]; because of its entering into the فَرْج of the
virgin girl. (IB, TA voce حرقوص.)
