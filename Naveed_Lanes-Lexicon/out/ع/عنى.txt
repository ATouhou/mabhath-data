عَنَاهُ الأَمْرُ, aor. يَعْنِيهِ and يَعْنُوهُ, inf. n. عِنَايةٌ
and عَنَايَةٌ (K, TA) and عُنِىٌّ, (TA, as from the K,
but not in the CK nor in my MS. copy of
the K,) The affair, or event, or case, disquieted
him; syn. أَهَمَّهُ [more fully expl. by what here
follows]: (K, TA:) [عَنَاهُ may be generally
rendered it concerned him; agreeing with this
in meaning it made him uneasy in mind,
anxious, or careful; and in meaning it affected
his interest, or was of importance to him; like
أَهَمَّهُ: and also it concerned him meaning it related, or belonged, to him; or was of his business;
as will be shown by what follows: and] عَنَانِى
كَذَا, aor. يَعْنِينِى, means such a thing occurred, or
happened, to me, and occupied me [or my mind].
(Msb.) The saying [in the Kur lxxx. 37], لِكُلِّ
امْرِئٍ مِنْهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ شَأْنٌ يَعْنِيهِ, thus accord. to one
reading, means يُهِمُّهُ [i. e. To every man of them
shall belong, on that day, a business that will disquiet him, &c.]: (Ksh, Bd;) or a business in
conjunction with which no other will disquiet him:
and like this is the other reading, which is with
غ; (TA;) i. e. يُغْنِيهِ, meaning which will suffice
him in respect of his being disquieted thereby;
(Ksh, Bd;) or the meaning of the latter reading
is, [a business such that] he will not be able, in
conjunction with his being disquieted thereby, to
be disquieted by any other; (TA;) or a state that
will occupy him so as to divert him from the state
of any other. (Jel.) And it is said in a trad.
respecting charming, بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ دَآءٍ
يَعْنِيكَ i. e. [By the name of God I charm thee
from, or against, any disease] that may disquiet
thee, &c., (يُهِمُّكَ,) and occupy thee [or thy mind].
(TA.) And in another trad. it is said, مِنْ حُسْنِ
إِسْلَامِ المْرْءِ تَرْكُهُ مَا لَا يَعْنِيهِ, meaning مَا لَا يُهِمُّهُ
[i. e. A condition of the goodness of the man's submitting himself to the requirements of God is his
leaving, or relinquishing, that which does not disquiet him, &c.]; (S, TA;) the exceptions therefrom being such things as necessary food and
clothing. (So in a marginal note in a copy of
the Jámi' es-Sagheer of Es-Suyootee.) See also
the prov.
مُعْتَرِضٌ لِعَنَنٍ لَمْ يَعْنِهِ
expl. voce عِنَانٌ. [It is like the common saying,
يَتَكَلَّمُ فِيمَا لَا يَعْنِيهِ He talks of that which does
not concern him; meaning that which does not
relate, or belong, to him; or that which is not of
his business.] ―

TA,) with kesr; (TA;) and عَنِىَ بِهِ, of the class
of رَضِىَ, (K, TA,) mentioned by IDrst and others
of the expositors of the Fs, and by Hr and Mtr,
(MF, TA,) and by IKtt on the authority of Et-
Toosee, (TA,) but this is seldom used, (K, TA,)
the former being that which is commonly known,
and this alone being mentioned by Th in his Fs,
and by J and others; (TA;) i. q. اِهْتَمَّ بِهِ [i. e.
He became disquieted by the affair, or case; or
rendered uneasy in mind, anxious, or careful, by
it; and consequently, he became occupied by it,
or with it; or set about it, and managed it]; as
also بِهِ ↓ اِعْتَنَى: (K, TA:) or بِأَمْرِهِ ↓ اِعْتَنَيْتُ
means I became disquieted by his affair, or case;
or rendered uneasy in mind, anxious, or careful,
by it; (اِهْتَمَمْتُ بِهِ;) and minded it; or managed
it well; (اِحْتَفَلْتُ بِهِ;) and عَنَيْتُ بِهِ, of the class
of رَمَى, inf. n. عِنَايَةٌ, signifies the same: and
عُنِيْتُ بِأَمْرِ فُلَانٍ, in the pass. form, inf. n. عِنَايَةٌ
and عُنِىٌّ, signifies I became occupied [either
actually or (as is shown by what follows) in
mind] by, or with, the affair, or case, of such a
one; and sometimes one said عَنَيْتُ بِأَمْرِهِ [in this
sense as well as the similar sense expl. above],
using the act. form: (Msb:) one says [also],
عُنِيتُ بِحَاجَتِكَ, with damm to the first letter,
[which may be rendered I became occupied by,
or with, thy want,] aor. أُعْنَى, inf. n. عِنَايَةٌ: (S:)
and لِتُعْنَ بِحَاجَتِى, (S, Msb,) which is the imperative form, (S,) meaning [Be thou occupied
by, or with, my want; or] let my want occupy,
or busy, thy mind: (Msb:) and in interrogating,
you say, كَيْفَ مَنْ تُعْنَى بِأَمْرِهِ [How is he by, or
with, whose affair, or case, thou art occupied, or
disquieted, &c.?]: you do not say, in this case,
تَعَنَّى [for تَتَعَنَّى]. (Az, TA.) ―
-b3-  عَنَى اللّٰهُ بِهِ,
[inf. n. عِنَايَةٌ, as is implied in the TA,] means

that it may be from عَنَى بِحَاجَتِهِ [as syn. with
عُنِىَ بِهَا]. (TA.) ―

the Tahdheeb of IKtt, (TA,) with kesr, (S, TA,)
of the class of تَعِبَ, (Msb,) aor. يَعْنَى; (S, Msb;)
or عَنَى, (K, TA,) with fet-h, thus in the copies
of the K, and likewise in the M; (TA;) inf. n.
عَنَأءٌ, (S, K, TA,) or this is a simple subst., from
عَنَّاهُ, (Mgh, Msb,) and عَنْيَةٌ is syn. therewith;
(ISd, K, TA;) He suffered difficulty, distress, or
trouble; (S, Msb, K, TA;) or fatigue, or weariness: and ↓ تعنّى, also, has the former or the
latter meaning. (S, K, TA.) You say, عَنِيتُ فِى
الأَمْرِ, meaning ↓ تَعَنَّيْتُ [i. e. I suffered difficulty,
&c., in the affair, or case]: mentioned by Az.
(TA.) ―
-b5-  And عَنِىَ signifies [also] He stuck fast
in captivity; (K in this art., and Msb in art. عنو;)
as also عَنَا, inf. n. عُنُوٌّ: (Msb in art. عنو:) or both
signify he became a captive. (K in art. عنو.)

a wholesome, or a beneficial, effect upon him, (syn.
نَجَعَ,) and [it is said that] the aor. is يَعْنَِى, like
يَرْمِى and يَرْضَى, (K, TA,) the latter mentioned
by ISd, as being anomalous, but MF says that
the latter has not been heard unless as having its
pret. like رَضِىَ, [i. e. عَنِىَ, of which عَنًى is the
inf. n. accord. to analogy,] and [SM adds that]
thus it is accord. to IKtt, who mentions the verb
as said also, in the same sense, of the drinking of
milk; (TA in this art.;) and he states that عَنَا,
aor. يَعْنُو, inf. n. عُنُوٌّ, is a dial. var. thereof. (TA

عَنْيَةٌ: see عَنَآءٌ.
عُنْيَانٌ i. q. عُنْوَانٌ [expl. in art. عنو]. (K.)
عَنَآءٌ Difficulty, distress, or trouble; (Mgh,
Msb; *) the subst. from عَنَّاهُ: (Mgh, Msb:) or
the suffering of difficulty, distress, or trouble; or
of fatigue, or weariness; inf. n. of عَنَى [or of
عَنِىَ]; and ↓ عَنْيَةٌ is syn. therewith. (K.) [See

-A2-  It is also a subst. from عَنَى in
the phrase عَنَى بِالقَوْلِ كَذَا [as such having the
signification of the inf. n. of that verb, or perhaps
as syn. with مَعْنًى]. (TA.)
عَانٍ: see عَنٍ. [See also art. عنو.] ―
-b2-  In the
phrase عَنَآءٌ عَانٍ, it denotes intensiveness; [the
meaning being Severe difficulty, &c.;] (K, TA;)
like شَاعِرٌ and مَائِتٌ in the phrases شِعْرٌ شَاعِرٌ and

مَعْنًى [signifying The meaning, or intended
sense, of a word or saying,] is from عَنَى بِالقَوْلِ
كَذَا [q. v.]; so says Z: (TA:) it is an inf. n. [of
this verb] used in the sense of the pass. part. n.;
or a contraction of the latter; i. e. of مَعْنِىٌّ:
(Dict. of the Technical Terms used in the Sciences
of the Musalmans:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib, it
signifies the import of a word or an expression,
from the phrase عَنَتِ الأَرْضُ بِالنَّبَاتِ meaning “ the
land made apparent, or showed, its plants, or
herbage: ” accord. to El-Munáwee, as he says in
the Towkeef, [and the like is said in the KT,]
an idea, i. e. a mental image, considered as having
a word, or an expression, applied to denote it, and
as being intended by that word or expression: [the
idea, or mental image,] considered as accruing,
from the word or expression, in the mind, is
termed مَفْهُومٌ: considered as what is said in reply
to مَا هُوَ [“ What is it? ”], it is termed مَاهِيَّةٌ:
considered as existing objectively, [as that by
which a thing is what it is,] it is termed حَقِيقَةٌ:
and considered as distinguished from others, it is
termed هُوِيَّةٌ: (TA:) signifying [as expl. above,
i. e.] the opposite to لَفْظٌ, it may be either a substance, or thing that subsists by itself, i. e. عَيْنٌ,
or an accident, or attribute, i. e. عَرَضٌ: but it
also signifies the opposite to عَيْنٌ, i. e. the opposite
to a thing that subsists by itself: (Kull p. 238:)
[hence اِسْمُ مَعْنًى, opposed to اِسْمُ عَيْنٍ; both of
which are expl. voce اِسْمٌ, in art. سمو:] مَعْنَى
الكَلَامِ and ↓ مَعْنَاتُهُ and ↓ مَعْنِيُّهُ (S, K, TA) and
↓ مَعْنِيَّتُهُ, (K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously,
مَعْنِيَتُهُ, without the sign of teshdeed,]) the last
mentioned by ISd, (TA,) are one [in signification], (S, K, TA,) as syn. with فَحْوَاهُ (TA, and
so in some copies of the S,) and مَقْصَدُهُ [both of
which are generally understood as signifying the
meaning, or intended sense, of the saying]: (TA:)
AHát says, the vulgar say, لِأَىِّ مَعْنًى فَعَلْتَ
[For what intent didst thou such a thing?]; but
the Arabs know not المَعْنَى, and never say it:
this is the case: but some of the Arabs say, مَا
هٰذَا ↓ مَعْنِىُّ [i. e. What is the meaning, or intent,
(lit. the meant or intended object,) of this?], with
kesr to the ن and with the ى musheddedeh: and
AZ says, ذَاكَ ↓ هٰذَا فِى مَعْنَاةِ and فِى مَعْنَاهُ سَوَآءٌ,
i. e. This is [used] in a manner the like of that in
respect of indication and import and acceptation:
El-Fárábee, also, says, مَعْنَى الشَّىْءِ and ↓ مَعْنَاتُهُ
are one [in signification]; and مَعْنَاهُ and فَحْوَاهُ
and مُقْتَضَاهُ and مَضْمُونُهُ all signify that which the
word, or expression, [termed before the thing,]
indicates: and it is said in the T, on the authority
of Th, that المَعْنَى and التَّفْسِيرُ and التَّأْوِيلُ, are
one [in signification, as meaning explanation, or
interpretation, or the like]: and people have used
their phrase هٰذَا مَعْنَى كَلَامِهِ, and the like,
meaning this is the import, and the indication of
the meaning, of his saying; which is agreeable with
what is said by AZ and El-Fárábee: the grammarians and lexicologists, moreover, have agreed
respecting a mode of expression of which they
have made frequent use, their saying هٰذَا بِمَعْنَى
هٰذَا [this is used with the meaning of this], and
هٰذَا وَهٰذَا فِى المَعْنَى وَاحِدٌ [this and this are in
meaning one] and فِى المَعْنَى سَوَآءٌ [in meaning
alike], and هٰذَا فِى مَعْنَى هٰذَا [this is used in the
sense of this] i. e. this is like this [in meaning]:
(Msb, TA:) the pl. of مَعْنًى is مَعَانٍ. (TA.) ―
-b2-
عِلْمُ المَعَانِى is expl. by El-Munáwee in the
“ Towkeef ” as The science whereby one knows
how to express clearly one meaning in various
ways: (TA:) [but this definition is applied in
the “ Talkhees ” (Talkhees el-Miftáh), and Hájjee
Khaleefeh uses the same words with only one
unimportant variation, in explaining عِلْمُ البَيَانِ;
and a similar explanation of the latter is given in
the Kull: in a marginal note in a copy of the
Ksh, cited by De Sacy in his Anthol. Gr. Ar.
p. 305, علم المعانى is expl. as the science whereby
is known the manner of adapting language to the
requirements of the case; (and it is similarly expl.
in the “ Talkhees ” and other works;) and علم
البيان, as the science that concerns comparisons
and tropes and metonymies.] ―
-b3-  [صُورَةٌ بِلَا مَعْنًى
means A form without any intrinsic quality.] ―
-b4-
And المَعَانِى signifies also The qualities that are
commended, or approved; [the charms, or graces;]
such as knowledge, or science, and piety, and
generosity, and goodliness of make, &c. (Har
p. 644.)
