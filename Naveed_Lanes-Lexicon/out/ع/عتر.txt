عتر1
عَتَرَ, aor.
عَتِرَ, inf. n. عَتْرٌ [and تَعْتَارٌ (mentioned
below in this paragraph), a form denoting repetition, or frequency, of the action, or its application to several objects, or it may be an inf. n.
of which the verb is ↓ عتّر], He slaughtered [or
sacrificed] (S, O, K, TA) an عَتِيرَة, (S, O,)
[i. e.] a sheep or goat, or a gazelle or the like.
(TA.) Sometimes a man, (S, O,) of the people
of the Time of Ignorance, (S,) made a vow that,
if he should see what he loved, he would
slaughter such and such of his sheep or goats;
and when the performance of the vow became
obligatory, he would be unwilling to do so, and
would slaughter gazelles instead of the sheep or
goats: (S, O:) sometimes he would say, “If
my camels amount to a hundred, I will slaughter
for them an عَتِيرَة; ” but when they amounted to
a hundred, he would be niggardly of the sheep or
goat, and would hunt a gazelle, and slaughter it.
(TA.) One says, هٰذِهِ أَيَّامُ تَرْجِيبٍ and تَعْتَارٍ
[These are days of the sacrificing of the عَتِيرَة].
(S, O.)

عَتَّرَ see above, first sentence.
عِتْرٌ Origin, or original state or condition; (S,
O, K;) and natural disposition; like عِكْرٌ. (O.)
One says, هُوَ كَرِيمُ العِتْرِ He is of generous origin.
(TK.) And it is said in a prov., عَادَتْ إِلَى عِتْرِهَا
لَمِيسُ Lemees [a proper name of a woman] returned to her original state or condition (S, O)
and natural disposition: (O:) applied to him
who has returned to a natural disposition which
he had relinquished. (S, O.) [See also عِكْرٌ.]
-A2-
Also A certain plant, (S, O, K,) used medicinally,
like the مَرْزَنْجُوش [or marjoram]; (S;) growing
like this latter plant, in a straggling manner; and
when it has grown tall, and its stem is cut, there
comes forth from it what resembles milk: (TA:)
accord. to Aboo-Ziyád, it is a plant of those
termed أَحْرَار [pl. of حُرٌّ], having a small round
fruit (جُرَىّ [dim. of جِرْوٌ]), which is sweet, or
pleasant in taste, eaten by men; and it grows like
as does the poppy, but is smaller: (AHn, O:) or
certain small trees [or plants], (S, K, TA,)
having round fruits (جِرَآء [pl. of جِرْوٌ]), like those
of the poppy: (TA as on the authority of AHn:)
AHn says, (O,) some assert it to mean the
مَرْزَنْجُوش; (O, TA;) but, he adds, this I have
not found to be known: (O:) and some say that
it is the عَرْفَج: (TA:) the n. un. is عِتْرَةٌ: (S,
O:) AHn says, a desert-Arab of Rabee'ah told
me that this is a small tree [or plant], that rises
to the height of a cubit, having many branches,
and green, round leaves, like the تَنُّوم, and round
fruits (جِرَآء), which are in pairs, near together,
hanging down towards the ground, and sweet, or
pleasant in taste, their taste being like that of
small cucumbers: it seldom, or never, grows singly,
but is found in pairs, or in fours, in one place:
and some assert that it abounds with milk: (O:)
it is also said to be a tree [or plant] that grows
by the burrow of the [lizard called] ضَبّ, which
mumbles it so that it does not increase; whence
the saying هُوَ أَذَلُّ مِنْ عِتْرَةِ الضَّبِّ [He is more
vile than the عترة of the ضبّ]: and it is also said,
in the K, to signify the مَرْزَنْجُوش, mentioned
above as being said to be a signification of عِتْرٌ:
(TA:) also, the caper. (K, * TA.) It is said in
a trad. that there is no harm in a man's treating
himself medically with senna and عِتْر while in a
state of إِحْرَام: (S, O:) which, some say, means
that there is no harm in taking these from the
sacred territory for such treatment. (O.)
-A3-  Also
An idol, (O, K,) such as had victims (عَتَائِر)
sacrificed to it. (O.) ―
-b2-  See also عَتِيرَةٌ.
عِتْرَةٌ The stem, or stock, of a tree: on the
authority of Aboo-Sa'eed and IAar: (TA:) and
the branches of a tree. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  [And
hence,] (assumed tropical:)  The people, or tribe, of a man, consisting of his nearer relations, (A'Obeyd, ISk, S,
A, O, Msb, K,) both the dead and the living:
(S, K:) or his relations: (Msb:) or his relations
consisting of his offspring and his paternal uncle's
sons: (A:) or his relations consisting of his offspring and of others: (TA:) or the more distinguished of one's relations: (IAth, TA:) or the
people of a man's house, the more near and more
distant: (O, TA:) and a man's offspring, or
progeny; (IAar, Th, Az, S, O, Msb, K;) which
is said to be the only meaning of the word known
to the Arabs; (Msb;) or imagined by the vulgar
to be its meaning peculiarly. (TA.) عِتْرَةُ النَّبِىِّ
means [The nearer portion of the tribe of the
Prophet, consisting of] the sons of 'Abd-El-Mut-
talib: (Aboo-Sa'eed, O:) or 'Abd-El-Muttalib
and his sons: (TA:) or the offspring of Fátimeh:
(IAar, TA:) or the nearer members of the house
of the Prophet, consisting of his own offspring
and of 'Alee and his offspring: or the nearer
and the more distant in relationship of the house of
the Prophet: or, as is commonly held, the people of
the house of the Prophet; who are those from whom
it is forbidden to exact the poor-rate, and those to
whom is assigned the fifth of the fifth mentioned
in the Soorat el-Anfál [the eighth chapter of the
Kur-án, verse 42]. (TA.)
-A2-  Also n. un. of عِتْرٌ
[q. v.]. (S, O.)
عَتِيرَةٌ A sheep, or goat, which they used to
slaughter, (S, O, Msb, K,) in [the month of]
Rejeb, (S, O, Msb,) to their gods, (S, O, K,) or
to their idols; (Msb;) i. q. رَجَبِيَّةٌ, (A'Obeyd,
TA,) i. e. a victim which was sacrificed in Rejeb,
as a propitiation, in the Time of Ignorance,
(A'Obeyd, Mgh, TA,) and also by the Muslims in
the beginning of El-Islám; (Mgh;) but the custom
was afterwards abolished; (A'Obeyd, Mgh, O;)
as also ↓ عِتْرٌ; (S, O, K;) which likewise signifies
any slaughtered animal; (K;) and so does ↓ عَاتِرَةٌ;
this being like رَاضِيَةٌ, in the phrase عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ,
for مَرْضِيَّةٌ; (Lth, TA;) or it may be a possessive
epithet [meaning ذَاتُ عَتْرٍ]: (TA:) the pl. of عَتِيرَةٌ
is عَتَائِرُ. (Msb.)
عَاتِرَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
