TA:) accord. to information given to AHn by
certain of the desert-Arabs of the Saráh (السَّرَاة),
it resembles the kind of tree called the غُبَيْرَآء, by

[And we used, when an insolent tyrant of a people
desired to execute against us a plot, to carry him
upon the horn of an antelope of a whitish dustcolour, or white but not of a clear hue, &c.];

one: and one says to a man who has passed the
night in disquieting distress, كُنْتَ عَلَى قَرْنِ أَعْفَرَ

(S:) and it is thus formed because مَعَافِرُ is sing.
in its application; whereas, in a rel. n. from a
pl. used as a pl., the formation is from the sing.,
as in the instance of مَسْجِدِىٌّ as a rel. n. from
مَسَاجِدُ: (TA:) ↓ معافر should not be pronounced
