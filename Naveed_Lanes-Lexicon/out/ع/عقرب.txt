عقربQ. 1
عَقْرَبَ He twisted, wreathed, curled,
curved, or bent, a thing. (MA.)
-A2-  [And, accord. to Freytag, He imitated the scorpion in
acting: but for this he names no authority; and
I doubt its correctness: see the next paragraph.]
Q. 2
تَعَقْرَبَ [It was crisp and curved; said
of a lock of hair hanging down upon the temple:
so accord. to Reiske, as mentioned by Freytag.
―
-b2-  And He acted like 'Akrab; a man notorious
for putting off the fulfilment of his promises; as
is said in the TA in the present art.]. (A and
TA in art. عرقب: see Q. 2 in that art.)
عَقْرَبٌ [The scorpion;] a certain venomous
reptile, (TA,) well known: (K, TA:) the word
is masc. (TA) and it is fem., (S, O, K, TA,)
generally the latter; (T, Msb, TA;) but is applied to the male and the female: (Lth, T, O,
Msb, TA:) and the male is called ↓ عُقْرُبَانٌ, (T,
S, O, Msb, K, TA,) accord. to some, (O,) when
one desires to denote it in a corroborative manner,
(Msb, TA,) and ↓ عُقْرُبَّانٌ also; (K;) or these
two words are syn. with عَقْرَبٌ: (K:) and the
female is called ↓ عَقْرَبَةٌ, (T, S, O, Msb, K,) sometimes, (T, Msb,) and ↓ عَقْرَبَآءُ, which is imperfectly decl.; (S, O, K;) or these two words and
عَقْرَبٌ, accord. to the “ Tahreer et-Tembeeh,” all
denote the female, and the male is called ↓ عُقْرُبَانٌ:
(TA:) or, as some say, the male and the female
are called only عَقْرَبٌ: (Msb, TA:) and of ↓ عُقْرُبَانٌ
it is said by IB, on the authority of AHát, that
it does not signify the male of عَقَارِب, but [as
expl. below] “ a certain creeping thing, having
long legs: ” (TA:) IJ says that you may drop
the ا and ن, and say ↓ عُقْرُرَّان: (L, TA:)
and an instance occurs of ↓ عَقْرَابٌ, as a coll. gen. n.,
in the following verse:
أَعُوذُ بِاللّٰهِ مِنَ العَقْرَابِ
اَلشَّائِلَاتِ عُقَدَ الأَذْنَابِ
[I seek protection by God from the scorpions
raising the joints of the tails]: but the ا here is
said to be inserted for the purpose of what is
termed الإِشْبَاع: (MF, from the “ Mukhtasar el-Bayán: ”) and الشائلات is applied as an epithet to
a sing. n. because this is used as a coll. gen. n.:
(M voce سَبْسَبٌ:) the pl. of عَقْرَبٌ is عَقَارِبُ. (S,
O.) ―
-b2-  And [hence] العَقْرَبُ is the name of (assumed tropical:)  A
certain sign of the Zodiac, (T, S, O, K,) [i. e. Scorpio,] to which belong the Mansions of the Moon
called الشَّوْلَةُ and القَلْبُ [and الإِكْلِيلُ] and
الزُّبَانَيَانِ. (T, TA. [See these words, and see
also شِيبَانُ, and مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ in art. نزل. It should
also be observed that the Arabs extended the
figure of this constellation (as they did that of
Leo) far beyond the limits that we assign to it.])
―
-b3-  [Hence, likewise,] عَقْرَبٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  A thong,
or strap, of a sandal, (O, K, TA,) in the form of
the reptile of this name. (TA.) [See also عَقْرَبَة.]
―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A thong, or strap, (O, K,) plaited, and
having a buckle at its extremity, (O,) by which
the crupper of a horse, or the like, is bound to
the saddle. (O, K.) ―
-b5-  And the pl. عَقَارِبُ signifies also (tropical:)  Malicious and mischievous misrepresentations, calumnies, or slanders. (O, K, TA.)
One says, إِنَّهُ لَتَدِبُّ عَقَارِبُهُ (tropical:)  Verily his malicious
and mischievous misrepresentations, &c., creep
along: (TA:) or he traduces, or defames, people
behind their backs, or otherwise. (O, K.) And
the phrase دَبَّتْ عَقَارِبُهُ is sometimes used to signify (tropical:)  His downy hair crept [along his cheeks].
(MF.) ―
-b6-  And (tropical:)  Reproaches for benefits conferred:
so in the saying of En-Nábighah,
عَلَىَّ لِعَمْرٍو نِعْمَةٌ بَعْدَ نِعْمَةٍ
لِوَالِدِهِ لَيْسَتْ بِذَاتِ عَقَارِبِ
(tropical:)  [I owe unto 'Amr favour after favour, for his
father, not accompanied by reproaches for benefits
conferred]. (TA.) ―
-b7-  And (assumed tropical:)  Hardships, severities,
difficulties, troubles, or distresses. (K.) عَقَارِبُ
الشِّتَآءِ means (assumed tropical:)  The hardships, severities, &c., of
winter: (TA:) or the intense cold thereof: (O,
K:) and عَقْرَبُ الشِّتَآءِ, accord. to IB, the assault,
and intense cold, of winter. (TA.) And عَيْشٌ ذُو
عَقَارِبَ means (assumed tropical:)  An uneasy life: or a life in which
is evil and roughness. (TA.) ―

K.) ―
-b3-  And, of a sandal, (assumed tropical:)  The knots of the
[thong, or strap, called] شِرَاك [q. v.]. (TA.) ―
-b4-
And, (O, K,) thus in all the copies of the K,
and in the handwriting of Ibn-Mektoom, but in
the L ↓ عَقْرَب, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  An intelligent female slave,
who does much service, or work. (O, L, K, TA.)

O, TA:) or a small creeping thing that enters the
ear; long, yellow, and having many legs: (TA:)
i. q. دَخَّالُ الأُذُنِ [an appellation now applied to
the earwig]; (Az, K;) and (K) so ↓ عُقْرُبَّانٌ.
(O, K.)
