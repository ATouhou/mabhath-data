عور1
عَوِرَ, (O, K,) said of a man, (O,) aor. يَعْوَرُ,
inf. n. عَوَرٌ, (S, O, K,) He was, or became, blind
of one eye: (K:) [or he became one-eyed; wanting one eye: or one of his eyes sank in its socket:
or one of his eyes dried up: see what next follows:] as also عَارَ, aor. يَعَارُ; and ↓ اعورّ; (K;)
and ↓ اعوارّ. (Sgh, K.) And عَوِرَتْ عَيْنُهُ, (Az, S,
IKtt, O, Msb,) aor. تَعْوَرُ, (Az, Msb,) inf. n. عَوَرٌ;
(IKtt, Msb;) and عَارَتْ, aor. تَعَارُ (Az, S, IKtt,
O) and تِعَارُ; (IKtt, TA;) and ↓ اعورّت; (Az, S,
IKtt, O;) and ↓ اعوارّت; (Az, O, TA;) His eye
became blind: (TA:) or became wanting: or
sank in its socket: (Msb:) or dried up. (IKtt,
TA.) Ibn-Ahmar says,
أَعَارَتْ عَيْنُهُ أَمْ لَمْ تَعَارَا
[Has his eye become blind or has it not indeed become blind?] meaning تَعَارَنْ; but, pausing, he
makes it to end with ا: in عَوِرَتْ, the و is preserved unaltered because it is so preserved in the
original form, which is اِعْوَرَّتْ, on account of the
quiescence of the letter immediately preceding:
then the augmentatives, the ا and the teshdeed,
are suppressed, and thus the verb becomes عَوِرَ:
for that اعورّت is the original form is shown by
the form of the sister-verbs, اِسْوَدَّ and اِحْمَرَّ; and
the analogy of verbs significant of faults and the
like, اِعْرَجَّ and اِعْمَىَّ as the original forms of عَرِجَ
and عَمِىَ; though these may not have been
heard. (S, O. [See also صَيِدَ.]) ―
-b2-  عَارَتِ الرَّكِيَّةُ,
aor. تَعُورُ [or تَعْوَرُ or تَعَارُ?], (tropical:)  The well became

(TA;) and ↓ أَعُوَرَهُ, (K,) inf. n. إِعْوَارٌ; (TA;) and
↓ عوّرهُ, (K,) inf. n. تَعْوِيرٌ; (TA;) He rendered
him blind of one eye. (K.) And عَارَ عَيْنَهُ, (S, M,
IKtt, O, Msb,) aor. يَعُورُهَا, (S, O, Msb,) inf. n.
عَوْرٌ: (IKtt;) and (more commonly, M) ↓ أَعْوَرَهَا;
and ↓ عوّرها; (S, M, IKtt, Msb;) He put out
his eye: (IKtt, Msb: *) or made it to sink in its
socket. (Msb.) Some say that عُرْتُ عَيْنَهُ and
↓ أَعَارَهَا [sic] are from عَائِرٌ, q. v. (TA.) ―
-b2-  عَارَ
الرَّكِيَّةَ and ↓ اعارها signify the same as ↓ عوّرها,
(tropical:)  He marred, or spoiled, the well, so that the
water dried up: (A, TA:) or he filled it up with
earth, so that the springs thereof became stopped
up: and in like manner, عُيُونَ الميَاهِ ↓ عوّر he
stopped up the sources of the waters: (Sh, TA:)
and عَيْنَ الرَّكِيَّةِ ↓ عوّر he filled up the source of the
well, so that the water dried up. (S.)
-A3-  عَارَهُ,
aor. يَعُورُهُ and يَعِيرُهُ, (S, K,) or the aor. is not
used, or, accord. to IJ, it is scarcely ever
used, (TA,) or some say يُعُورُهُ, (Yaakoob,) or
يَعِيرُهُ, (Aboo-Shibl,) He, or it, took, and went
away with, him, or it: (S, O, K:) or destroyed
him, or it. (K, TA.) One says, مَا أَدْرِى أَىُّ
الجَرَادِ عَارَهُ I know not what man went away with
him, or it: (S, O, TA:) or took him, or it.
(TA.) It is said to be only used in negative
phrases: but Lh mentions أَرَاكَ عُرْتَهُ, and عِرْتَهُ, I
see thee, or hold thee, to have gone away with him,
or it: [see also art. عير:] IJ says, It seems that
they have scarcely ever used the aor. of this verb
because it occurs in a prov. respecting a thing
that has passed away. (TA.)

عاورهُ الشَّىْءَ He did with the thing like as he
(the other) did with it: (S:) [or he did the thing

إِجَابَةٌ and جَابَةٌ; (Az, Msb;) [or rather عَارَةٌ is a
quasi-inf. n.; and so is طَاعَةٌ, and جَابَةٌ;] and
اعارهُ مِنْهُ; and إِيَّاهُ ↓ عاورهُ; (K;) [accord. to the
TK, all signify He lent him the thing: but the
second seems rather to signify he lent him of it:
and respecting the third, see 3 above.] For three
exs., see 10. سَيْفٌ أُعِيرَتْهُ المَنِيَّةُ (tropical:)  [A sword which
fate has had lent to it] is an appellation applied
to a man, by En-Nábighah. (TA.) [See also 4

thing, or did it, by turns; syn. تَدَاوَلُوهُ, (S, Mgh,
O, Msb, K,) فِيمَا بَيْنَهُمْ: (S, O, TA:) the و is
apparent [not changed into ا] in اعتوروا because it
signifies the same as تعاوروا. (S.) Aboo-Kebeer
says,
وَإِذَا الكُمَاةُ تَعَاوَرُوا طَعْنَ الكُلَى
[And when the men clad in armour interchange
the piercing of the kidneys]. (TA.) And in a

from the north, and another time from the east,
and another time from the west: (Az, TA:) or

(TA.) تَعَاوُرٌ and ↓ اِعْتِوَارٌ denote that this has the
place of this, and this the place of this: one says
هٰذَا مَرَّةً وَهٰذَا مَرَّةً ↓ اِعْتَوَارَاهُ [They two took it, or
did it, by turns; this, one time; and this, one

عَوْرَةٌ The pudendum, or pudenda, (S, O, Msb,
K,) of a human being, (S, O,) of a man and of a
woman: (TA:) so called because it is abominable to uncover, and to look at, what is thus
termed: (Msb:) said in the B to be from عَارٌ,
meaning مَذَمَّةٌ: (TA:) [but see what is said voce
عَارِيَّةٌ: the part, or parts, of the person, which it
is indecent to expose:] in a man, what is between
the navel and the knee: and so in a woman: (Jel
in xxiv. 31:) or, in a free woman, all the person,
except the face and the hands as far as the wrists;
and respecting the hollow of the sole of the foot,
there is a difference of opinion: in a female slave,
like as in a man; and what appears of her in
service, as the head and the neck and the fore
arm, are not included in the term عورة. (TA.)
[العَوْرَةُ المُغَلَّظَةُ means The anterior and posterior
pudenda: العَوْرَةُ المُخَفَّفَةُ, the other parts included
in the term عورة: so in the law-books.] The
covering what is thus termed, in prayer and on
other occasions, is obligatory: but respecting the
covering the same in a private place, opinions
differ. (TA.) The pl. is عَوْرَاتٌ: (S, O, Msb:)
for the second letter of the pl. of فَعْلَةٌ as a subst. is
movent only when it is not و nor ى: but some
read [in the Kur xxiv. 31], عَوَرَاتِ النِّسَآءِ, (S, O,)
which is of the dial. of Hudheyl. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  A
time in which it is proper for the عَوْرَة to appear;

man veils, or conceals, by reason of disdainful
pride, or of shame or pudency: (Msb:) anything
of which one is ashamed (S, O, K, TA) when it
appears. (TA.) ―
-b4-  See also عَوَرٌ. ―
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  A woman:

for veiling or covering. (K.) ―
-b7-  A gap, an opening, or a breach, (T, Msb, K,) or any gap, opening, or breach, (S, O,) in the frontier of a hostile
country, (T, S, O, Msb, K,) &c., (K,) or in war
or battle, from which one fears (T, S, O, Msb)
slaughter. (T.) ―
-b8-  Sometimes it is applied as an
epithet to an indeterminate subst.; and in this
case it is applied to a sing. and to a pl., without
variation, and to a masc. and a fem., like an inf. n.
(TA.) It is said in the Kur [xxxiii. 13], إِنَّ بُيُوتَنَا
عَوْرَةٌ (O, TA) [Verily our houses are open and
exposed: or, as expl. by Bd and others, defenceless]: the epithet being here sing.; and the subst.
to which it is applied, pl.: (TA:) but in this instance it may be a contraction of ↓ عَوِرَةٌ; and
thus it has been read: (Bd:) see عَوِرٌ. ―
-b9-  Also,
(K,) or [the pl.] عَوْرَاتٌ, (S,) Clefts, or fissures,
of mountains. (S, K.)
عَوَرَةٌ a subst. meaning ↓ عَوَرٌ [q. v.]: (O:) [it
is mentioned in the S as a subst., and app., from
the context, as signifying عَوَرٌ, i. e. A blindness of
one eye: (but expl. by Golius as meaning the succession of a worse after a better:) after the mention of رَجُلٌ أَعْوَرُ, and the phrase بَدَلٌ أَعْوَرُ and
خَلَفٌ أَعْوَرُ, in the S, it is added, وَالاِسْمُ العَوَرَةُ,
or, accord. to one copy, العَوْرَةُ; and then follows,
وَقَدْ عَارَتِ العَيْنُ.]
عُورَانٌ a pl. of أَعْوَرُ [q. v.]; as also عِيرَانٌ. ―
-b2-
It is also used as a sing.; رَكِيَّةٌ عُورَانٌ meaning
(assumed tropical:)  A well in a state of demolition. (O, K.)
عَارِيَّةٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and sometimes
عَارِيَةٌ, without teshdeed, (Msb, K,) when used in
poetry, (Msb,) and ↓ عَارَةٌ, (S, O, K,) What is
taken by persons by turns; expl. by مَا تَدَاوَلُوهُ
بَيْنَهُمْ: (K:) [generally meaning a loan: and the
act of lending;] the putting one in possession of
the use of a thing without anything given in exchange: (KT, and Kull p. 262:) the returning
of the thing thus termed is obligatory, when the
thing itself remains in existence; and if it has
perished, then one must be responsible for its
value, accord. to Esh-Sháfi'ee, but not accord. to
Aboo-Haneefeh: (TA:) pl. [of the first] عَوَارِىُّ,
(S, O, Msb, K,) and [of the second] عَوَارٍ. (Msb,
K.) A poet says,
وَالْعَوَارِىُّ قَصَارٌ أَنْ تُرَدْ  إِنَّمَا أَنْفُسُنَا عَارِيَّةٌ
[Our souls are only a loan: and the end of loans
is their being given back: تُرَدْ being for تُرَدَّ]. (S,
O.) عَارِيَّةٌ is of the measure فَعْلِيَّةٌ: Az says that
it is a rel. n. from عَارَةٌ, which is a subst. from
إِعَارَةٌ: (Mgh, * Msb:) Lth says that what is thus
called is so called because it is a disgrace (عار) to
him who demands it; and J says the like; and
some say that it is from عَارَ الفَرَسُ, meaning, “the
horse went away from his master: ” but both these
assertions are erroneous; since عاريّة belongs to
art. عور, for the Arabs say هُمْ يَتَعَاوَرُونَ العَوَارِىَّ,
meaning they lend [loans], one to another; and
عَارٌ and عَارَ الفَرَسُ belong to art. عير: therefore
the correct assertion is that of Az. (Msb.)
عَوَارٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ عُوَارٌ (AZ, S,
Msb, K) and ↓ عِوَارٌ (K) A fault; a defect; an
imperfection; a blemish; something amiss; (S,
Mgh, Msb, K;) in an article of merchandise, (S,
Mgh, Msb,) and in a garment, or piece of cloth,
(TA,) and in a slave, (Msb,) and in a beast:
(TA:) or in a garment, or piece of cloth, a hole,
and a rent; (Lth, Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) and so
in the like, and in a house or tent and the like;
(TA;) and in a garment, or piece of cloth, also
a burn; and a rottenness: (Mgh:) and some say
that عَوَارٌ, with fet-h, is only in goods, or commodities, or articles of merchandise. (Msb.) You
say سِلْعَةٌ ذَاتُ عَوَارٍ, and ↓ عُوَارٍ, accord. to AZ, An
article of merchandise having a fault, or the like.

also ↓ عُوَّارٌ: (Msb:) which latter also signifies foul,
thick, white matter, that collects in the inner corner
of the eye; not fluid; syn. رَمَصٌ: (Msb:) or
both signify a fluid matter that makes the eye
smart, as though a mote, or the like, had fallen
into it: (Lth:) and both signify a mote, or the
like, (S, O, K,) in the eye: (S:) or (TA, in the
K “ and ”) عَائِرٌ signifies pimples, or small pustules, in the lower eyelid: (K:) a subst., not an
inf. n., nor an act. part. n.: (TA:) the pl. of
↓ عُوَّارٌ is عَوَاوِيرُ, and, by poetic license, عَوَاوِرُ.
(TA.) One says ↓ بِعَيْنِهِ عُوَّارٌ, meaning, In his
eye is a mote, or the like. (S.) ―
-b2-  عَيْنٌ عَائِرَةٌ An
eye in which is the fluid matter called ↓ عُوَّار: but
when the eye has this, you do not say of it عَارَتْ.
(Lth.) ―
-b3-  عَائِرُ العَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  What fills, or satisfies, the
eye (مَا يَمْلَؤُهَا), of مَال [meaning camels or the

المَالِ عَائِرَةُ عَيْنٍ, (S, O,) or عَائِرَةُ عَيْنَيْنِ and ↓ عَيِّرَةُ
عَيْنَيْنِ, (K, but with عَلَيْهِ in the place of عِنْدَهُ, and

mentioned by Lh, (TA,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [He has, of camels
or the like], what fill, or satisfy, (تَمْلَأُ,) his sight
by the multitude thereof; (K;) or that at which
the sight is confounded, or perplexed, by reason of
the multitude thereof, as though it filled, or satisfied, the eye, and put it out: (S, O:) [and
A'Obeyd says the like:] or, accord. to As, the
Arab in the Time of Ignorance used, when his
camels amounted to a thousand, to put out an
eye of one of them; and hence, by عَائِرَةُ العَيْنِ
they meant a thousand camels, whereof one had
an eye put out. (TA.)
-A2-  عَائِرٌ also signifies An
arrow of which the shooter is not known; (S, O,
K;) and in like manner, a stone: (S, O:) pl.
عَوَائِرُ: (TA:) عَوَائِرُ نَبْلٍ means arrows in a scattered state, of which one knows not whence they

and عُورَانٌ (O, K) and عِيرَانٌ. (K.) The أَعْوَر is
considered by the Arabs as of evil omen. (TA.)

-b8-  بَدَلٌ أَعْوَرُ
(assumed tropical:)  [A bad substitute]: a prov. applied to a man
who is dispraised succeeding one who is praised:
and sometimes they said خَلَفٌ أَعْوَرُ: and Aboo-Dhu-eyb uses the expression خِلَافٌ عُورٌ; as

that swerves from rectitude: (TA:) or a word

rectitude: (Lth:) or a word or saying which the
ear rejects; and in the pl. sense you say عُورَانُ
الكَلَامِ: (AZ:) or a bad, an abominable, or a
foul, action: (K:) as though the word or saying, or the action, blinded the eye: the attribute
which it denotes is transferred to the word or
saying, or the action; but properly its author is
meant. (TA.) ―

مُعْوِرٌ: see عَوِرٌ, in four places.
مُسْتَعَارٌ [Borrowed; or asked, demanded, or
sought, as a loan;] pass. part. n. of 10 as used in
the phrase اِسْتَعَارَهُ ثَوْبًا [q. v.] so in the following
verse of Bishr (S, O) Ibn-Abee-Házim, describing
a horse: (O:)
كَأَنَّ حَفِيفَ مَنْخِرِهِ إِذَا مَا
كَتَمْنَ الرَّبْوُ كِيرٌ مُسْتَعَارُ
[As though the sound of the wind of his nostril,
when they (i. e. other horses) suppressed loud
breathing, were the sound of the wind of a borrowed blacksmith's bellows]: or, as some say,
مستعار here means مُتَعَاوَرٌ i. e. مُتَدَاوَلٌ [app.
worked by turns]: (S, O:) he means that his
nostril was wide, not suppressing the loud breathing, when other beasts suppressed the breath by
reason of the narrowness of the place of exit
thereof. (S in art. كتم.) ―
-b2-  [And hence, (tropical:)  A
word, or phrase, used metaphorically.]
