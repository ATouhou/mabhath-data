عَاهِرٌ An adulterer or a fornicator; (S, O,
Msb;) as also ↓ عَهْرٌ [originally an inf. n.]: and
↓ عُهْيَرَةٌ occurs in a trad. in the same sense, as a
dim. of عَهْرٌ: or, accord. to ISh, on the authority
of Ru-beh, عَاهِرٌ signifies one who follows evil,
whether by committing adultery or fornication, or
by stealing: (O, TA:) or, as in the L, whether
by committing adultery or fornication, or by transgressing [in any other manner], or quitting the way
of truth or justice, or forsaking the command of
God; أَوْ فَاسِقًا being put in the L in the place of
او سَارِقًا: (TA:) or any one who does that which
induces doubt, or suspicion or evil opinion, or doubt
combined with suspicion or evil opinion: (A, TA:)
pl. عُهَّارٌ. (Ham p. 131.) It is said in a trad., الوَلَدُ
لِلْفِرَاشِ وَلِلْعَاهِرِ الحَجَرُ, (S, Mgh, O, &c.,) i. e.,
The child is for the master of the bed, (Mgh,
Msb, TA,) meaning, the husband (Msb, TA) of
the child's mother, or, if she be a slave, her
owner; (TA;) and for the adulterer, or fornicator, disappointment; (Msb;) meaning, he
shall have no right of relationship, (A'Obeyd, S,
Mgh, O, Msb,) nor any share in the child: (TA:)
like the saying لَهُ التُّرَابُ, (A'Obeyd, Mgh, O,
Msb,) which means “ [he has, or shall have,
or may he have,] disappointment,” (Msb,) or
“ nothing: ” (Mgh, O, TA:) for some of the
Arabs used to establish relationship arising from
adultery or fornication; therefore the law annulled
this: (Msb:) some, however, explain it agreeably with the apparent [or literal] meaning, and
for the adulterer, or fornicator, stoning. (Mgh.)
