عقر1
عَقَرَهُ, (S, Mgh, O, &c.,) aor.
عَقِرَ, (Mgh, O,
Msb, K,) inf. n. عَقْرٌ, (S, * Mgh, O, Msb, K,) He
wounded him; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) [and so,
app., accord. to the K, ↓ عقّرهُ, inf. n. تَعْقِيرٌ; or
the latter signifies he wounded him much; for it
is said that] تَعْقِيرٌ signifies more than عَقْرٌ: (S,
O:) you say of a lion, and of a lynx, and of a
leopard, and of a wolf, يَعْقِرُ النَّاسَ [He wounds
men]. (Az, Msb.) ―
-b2-  And عَقَرَهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,
&c.,) and عَقَرَهَا, (L, Mgh, &c.,) aor.
عَقِرَ, (K,) inf. n.
عَقْرٌ; (Mgh, &c.;) and ↓ عقّرهُ, (K,) and عقّرها,
(L,) inf. n. تَعْقِيرٌ; (TA;) [or the latter has an
intensive signification, or applies to many objects;
see above;] He hocked, houghed, or hamstrung,
(عَرْقَبَ,) him, or her, namely, a beast; (TA;) he
laid bare his [or her] (namely, a camel's) عُرْقُوب
[or hock-tendon]; such being the meaning of عقر
with the Arabs; (Az, TA;) he struck, (S, IAth,
Mgh, Msb,) or cut, (TA,) his, (a camel's, S,
IAth, O, Msb, or a horse's, S, O, or a sheep's
or goat's, IAth,) or her, (a camel's, L, Mgh,)
legs, بِالسَّيْفِ with the sword, (S, IAth, Mgh, O,
Msb, TA,) while the beast was standing; (IAth;)
he cut one of his, or her, (a camel's,) legs, previously to stabbing the animal, that it might not
run away when being stabbed, but might fall
down, and so be within his power; he moved
[his or] her (a camel's) legs with the sword;
(IKtt, TA;) he made a mark, or wound, like a
notch, in his, or her, (a horse's, or a camel's,)
legs. (K.) [See عَقْرٌ, below.] ―
-b3-  Hence (Az,
TA,) عَقَرَهُ, aor. and inf. n. as above, He stabbed
him, namely, a camel; slaughtered him by stabbing: (Az, Msb, TA:) because the slaughterer
of the camel first lays bare its عَرْقُوب [or hocktendon; or hocks it; or strikes or cuts its legs,
or one of its legs, with a sword: see above].
(Az, TA.) So in the saying of Imra-el-Keys,
وَيَوْمَ عَقَرْتُ لِلْعَذَارَى مَطِيَّتِى
[And the day when I slaughtered for the virgins
my riding-camel]. (TA.) And so in the trad. لَا
عَقْرَ فِى الإِسْلَامِ [There shall be no slaughtering of
camels at the grave in the time of El-Islám]: for
they used to slaughter camels at the graves of the
dead, saying, The occupant of the grave used to
slaughter camels for guests in the days of his
life; so we recompense him by doing the like
after his death. (IAth, TA.) ―
-b4-  Hence also, He
slew him; he destroyed him: of this signification
we have an ex. in the story of Umm-Zara: وَعَقْرَ
جَارَتِهَا And [a cause of] the destruction of her
fellow-wife through [the latter's] envy [of her]
and rage [against her]. (TA.) ―
-b5-  حَلْقَى ↓ عَقْرَى,
(Mgh, O, Msb, K, &c.,) said of a woman, (TA,)
occurring in a trad. of Safeeyeh, (Mgh, Msb, TA,)
in which Mohammad is related to have used this
expression, on the day of the return of the pilgrims from Minè, when he was told that she had
her menstrual flux, to which he added, “I see
her not to be aught but a hinderer of us; ” thus
accord. to the relaters of traditions, each word
being an inf. n., like دَعْوَى; (O, * TA;) of the
measure فَعْلَى; or, as some say, the ى is to
mark a pause; (Mgh;) and عَقْرًا حَلْقًا, (O, K,)
which are also inf. ns.; (TA;) and this is accord.
to the usage of the Arabs; (Az, TA;) being a
form of imprecation, though not meant to express
a desire for its having effect, (Az, Msb, TA,) for
what is meant by it is only blame; (Msb;) expl.
by وَعَقَرَهَا اللّٰهُ تَعَالَى وَحَلَقَهَا, (K,) i. e., [May God
(exalted be He) wound her, &c., and] shave her
hair, or afflict her with a pain in her throat:
(TA:) or may her body be wounded (عُقِرَ), and
may she be afflicted with a disease in her throat:
(Mgh, O: *) so accord. to A'Obeyd: or may her
leg and her throat be cut: or may her leg be cut
and her head shaven: (Mgh:) [or may she be
destroyed, and may her throat be cut:] or the
two words عقرى and حلقى are epithets, applied
to a woman of ill luck; and the meaning is, (Z,
O, TA,) she is one who extirpates [or destroys,
and cuts the throats of,] her people, by the effect
of her ill luck upon them; (Z, O, K, * TA;) being virtually in the nom. case, as enunciatives;
i. e., وَحَلْقَى ↓ هِىَ عَقْرَى. (Z, TA.) Lh mentions
the phrase, ↓ لَا تَفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ أُمُّكَ عَقْرَى [app. meaning, Do thou not that: may thy mother be childless: (see عَقُرَت:)] without explaining it: but he
mentions it with the phrases أُمُّكَ ثَاكِلٌ and أُمُّكَ
هَابِلٌ. (TA.) Or ↓ عَقْرَى signifies Having the
menstrual flux. (K.) One says also, imprecating
a curse upon a man, جَدْعًا لَهُ وَعَقْرًا وَحَلْقًا, meaning, May God [maim him, and] wound (عَقَرَ) his
body, and afflict him with a pain in his throat:
and sometimes, حَلْقَى ↓ عَقْرَى, without tenween.
(S.) [See also 1 in art. حلق.] ―
-b6-  عَقَرَبِهِ He killed
the beast which he was riding, and made him to
go on foot: he hocked, houghed, or hamstrung, his
beast. (TA.) ―
-b7-  Hence, عَقَرْتَ بِى Thou hast
long detained me, or restrained me; as though
thou hadst hocked (عَقَرْتَ) my camel and I were
therefore unable to journey: ISk cites as an ex.
قَدْ عَقَرَتْ بِالْقَوْمِ أُمُّ خَزْرَجِ
[Umm-Khazraj has long detained the party, or
people]. (S, O, TA.) And in the A it is said
that عَقَرَتْ فُلَانَةُ بِالرَّكْبِ means Such a woman,
or girl, came forth to the riders on camels, and
they staid long in her presence; as though she
hocked (عَقَرَت) the camels upon which they rode.
(TA.) One says also قَدْ كَانَتْ لِى حَاجَةٌ فَعَقَرَنِى
عَنْهَا I had a want, and he withheld me from it,
and hindered me. (Ibn-Buzurj, L.) Hence, عَقْرُ
النَّوَى, (Az, TA,) meaning صَرْفُهَا حَالًا بَعْدَ حَالٍ
[i. e. The shifting about of the course of a journey
by successive changes: see صَرْفٌ, third sentence].
(O, TA.) ―
-b8-  And عَقَرَ بِالصَّيْدِ i. q. وَقَعَ بِهِ [app.
meaning He made much slaughter among the
objects of the chase]. (O, K.) ―
-b9-  And عَقَرَتْ بِهِمْ
She (a woman) smote their souls, and wounded
their hearts. (O.) ―
-b10-  عَقَرَ النَّخْلَةَ, (inf. n. عَقْرٌ,
TA, and subst. [or quasi-inf. n., like جَدَادٌ and
صَرَامٌ and قَطَافٌ &c.,] ↓ عَقَارٌ, T, S, O, TA,) He
cut off the head of the palm-tree, (T, S, O, K,)
altogether, with the heart (الجُمَّار), (T, S, O,)
so that it dried up, (K,) and nothing came forth
from its trunk. (IKtt.) ―
-b11-  لَا تَعْقِرَنَّ شَجَرًا Thou
shalt by no means cut down trees. (Mgh.) ―
-b12-  عَقَرَ
المَرْعَى He cut down the trees of the pasture-land:
he cut down the herbage, or pasture, and spoiled
it. (TA.) ―
-b13-  عَقَرَ الكَلَأَ He ate the herbage, or
pasture. (O, K.) And He had the herbage for
pasturage. (O.) ―
-b14-  You say of wine, يَعْقِرُ العَقْلَ
[It disables the intellect; like as a man disables a
beast by hocking him]. (IAar.) ―
-b15-  عَقَرَهُ, (S, O,
TA,) aor.
عَقِرَ, (TA,) inf. n. عَقْرٌ, (S, O, TA,) He
(a man) galled his (a camel's) back: (TA:) he
galled it; namely, a camel's back: (S, O:) it (a
camel's saddle, TA, and a horse's saddle, S, O,
TA) galled his (the beast's) back. (S, O, TA.) ―

sudden fright, (K, TA,) and stupified, or deprived
of his reason, (TA,) so that he could not advance
nor retire. (K, TA.) عَقِرْتُ حَتَّى خَرَرْتُ إِلَى الأَرْضِ
[My legs betrayed me, &c., so that I fell to the
earth] was said by 'Omar. (S.) And one says,
عَقِرْتُ حَتَّى مَا أَقْدِرُ عَلَى الكَلَامِ [I am stupified,
or taken by sudden fright, &c., so that I am not
able to talk]. (M, TA.) [And عَقِرَ alone means
He became unable to speak. In one place in the
L, this verb is written عُقِرَ; but this is probably
a mistake.]
-A3-  عَقُرَتْ, aor.
عَقُرَ; (S, IJ, M, IKtt,
L, Msb;) in the K, عُقِرَتْ, of the class of عُنِىَ;
but the authorities indicated above show that
عَقُرَتْ is the correct form; (TA;) and عَقَرَتْ,
aor.
عَقِرَ; (M, IKtt, L, Msb, K;) and عَقِرَتْ, aor.
عَقَرَ;
(M, IKtt, L;) inf. n. عُقْرٌ, (S, M, IKtt, L, Msb,
K,) of the first, (S, Msb, like as حُسْنٌ is inf. n.
of حَسُنَتْ, (S,) or of the second, (M, L, K,) and
عَقَارَةٌ (M, L, K) and عُقَارَةٌ, (K,) or عِقَارَةٌ, (M and
L, as in the TA,) which are of the first, (M, L,
K,) and عَقْرٌ, (M, IKtt, L, Msb, K,) which is of
the second, (M, L, Msb, K,) and عَقَارٌ, or عُقَارٌ,
(accord. to different copies of the K,) or عِقَارٌ, (M
and L, as in the TA,) also of the second, (K,)

[See 1.]
3
عاقرهُ He contended with him for superior
glory (K, TA) and generosity and excellence (TA)
in the hocking, or slaughtering, (عَقْر [see 1],) of
camels. (K, TA.) It was customary for two
men thus to contend for superior munificence,
[giving away the flesh of the victims,] but they
did so for the sake of display and vain glory;
wherefore the eating of the flesh of camels
slaughtered on an occasion of this kind is forbidden in a trad., and they are likened to animals
sacrificed to that which is not God. (TA.) ―
-b2-
And عاقرهُ, (TK,) inf. n. مُعَاقَرَةٌ, (S, K,) He held
a dialogue or colloquy, or a disputation or debate,

him, or it. (TA.) You say عاقر الخَمْرَ, (S, * TA,)
and simply عاقر, (TA,) He kept, or applied himself, constantly, or perseveringly, to the drinking
of wine: (S, TA:) or مُعَاقَرَةُ الشَّرَابِ signifies the
contending with wine for superiority; as when a
man says, I have more, or most, strength for
drinking, and so contending with it for superiority, and being overcome thereby. (Aboo-Sa'eed, TA.) You say also, عَاقَرَتِ الخَمْرُ الدَّنَّ
The wine remained long confined to the [jar
called] دَنّ; syn. لَازَمَتْهُ. (S, K.) And عاقرت
الخَمْرُ العَقْلَ [app., The wine took hold upon the
intellect: or contended with it for superiority]. (S.)
4
اعقرهُ He stupified him [so that his legs betrayed him and he was unable to fight or to
advance or retire: see عَقِرَ]. (S, O.)

one says, أَعْقَرْتُكَ كَلَأَ مَوْضِعِ كَذَا I have given
thee permission to pasture thy beasts upon the
herbage of such a place. (O.)
-A4-  And اعقر He
became possessed of much property such as is
termed عَقَار. (S, IKtt, O.)
6
تَعَاقَرَا, (K,) or تعاقرا إِبِلَهُمَا, (S, O,) They
two hocked, or hamstrung, their camels, (عَرْقَبَا
إِبِلَهُمَا, S, O, or عَقَرَاهَا, K,) vying, each with the
other, therein, (S, O,) that it might be seen which
of them should do so most. (K.) [See 3.]
7
انعقر He (a camel, and a horse, [&c.,])
[became hocked, houghed, or hamstrung; had his
hock-tendon laid bare;] had his legs struck [or
cut] with a sword. (S.) [See 1.] ―
-b2-  It (a camel's
or a horse's back) became galled by the saddle;
as also ↓ اعتقر. (S, K.)
8
إِعْتَقَرَ see what next precedes.
عَقْرٌ The act of wounding; &c.: [see 1:] a
mark, or wound, (أَثَرٌ,) like a notch, (كالحَزِّ, K,
TA, [in the CK, كالخَرِّ,]) in the legs of a horse,

عَقْرَى حَلْقَى: see 1.]
-A2-  See also عُقْرٌ, first sentence:
-A3-  and again in the last quarter.
-A4-  Also
What is, or constitutes, the most essential part, of
anything; or the prime, or the principal part,
thereof; syn. أَصْلٌ: [such appears to me to be
the meaning of اصل as here used, from what follows.] (S, IF, Msb.) ―
-b2-  The principal part (أَصْل)
of a دَار [i. e., a country]; (As, S, Msb, K;)
which is the place where the people dwell, or
abide; (As, S;) as also ↓ عُقْرٌ: (As, S, Msb, K:)
the former of the dial. of Nejd; (As, TA;) and
the latter of the dial. of the people of El-Medeeneh, (As, S,) or of the dial. of El-Hijáz; (TA;)
or both of the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz;
and the latter, in the dial. of others, signifies the
chief, or main, part of a دار; (Msb;) and the
latter also signifies the middle [or heart] of a دار:
(K:) or عَقْرُ الدَّارِ and ↓ عُقْرُهَا both signify the
principal part (اصل) of the place of abode of a
people, upon which they rest their confidence.
(Mgh, O.) This last signification is exemplified
by the trad. of 'Alee, مَا غُزِىَ قَوْمٌ فِى عَقْرِ دَارِهِمْ إِلَّا
ذَلُّوا [No people have had war waged against them
in the principal part of their country, upon which
they rest their confidence, but they have become
abased, or brought into subjection]: (Mgh,
O:) or the meaning here is, in the midst [or
heart] of their country, &c.; i. e., in the place
where they abide, or lodge. (L.) It is said in
another trad., عَقْرُ دَارِ الْإِسْلَامِ الشَّأْمُ, meaning,
The principal part (اصل), and the place, of the
country of El-Islám is Syria: apparently pointing to a time of conflicts and factions, or seditions, when Syria should be free from them, and
the Muslims should there be more secure. (TA.)
Lth has confounded in explaining what is the
عُقْر of a دار and what is the عُقْر of a tank or
trough for watering beasts &c. (Az.)

and ↓ عُقْرَةٌ, (A, K,) Barrenness, in a woman, (S,
K, &c.,) and in a man. (S, TA.) You say also
لَقِحَتِ النَّاقَةُ عَنْ عُقْرٍ [The she-camel conceived
after having been barren]. (S, O.) And لَقِحَ
لِقَاؤُكَ عَنْ عُقْرٍ [app., (assumed tropical:)  The meeting thee hath been
productive of good after barrenness thereof]. (A,
TA.) And لَقِحْنَ إِلَى عُقْرٍ, a phrase used by
Dhu-r-Rummeh, referring to wars; i. e. (assumed tropical:)  They
returned to stillness. (TA.) And رَجَعَتِ الحَرْبُ
إِلَى عُقْرٍ (assumed tropical:)  The war became languid. (A, TA.)
―
-b2-  عُقْرٌ in a palm-tree means [Barrenness, or a
drying up, and perishing, occasioned by] having
the [fibrous substance called] لِيف stripped off
(O, K, TA) from the heart, (O, TA,) and the
heart itself taken away; (O, K, TA;) which
being done, it dries up and perishes. (Az, O,
TA.)
-A2-  Also, or ↓ عُقُرٌ, or the latter is used only
by poetic license, Anything which a man drinks,
and in consequence thereof has no offspring born
to him. (O, TA.)
-A3-  Also, عُقْرٌ, A kind of dowry,
(S,) or compensation, (IAth,) which is given to a
woman when connection has been had with her in
consequence of dubiousness, or a likeness [on her
part to the man's wife]: (إِذَا وُطِئَتْ عَنْ شُبْهَةٍ, S;
or بِشُبْهَةٍ, Mgh; or عَلَى وَطْءِ الشُّبْهَةِ, IAth:) or a
recompense which is given to a woman for connection with her: (AO:) or a mulct, or fine, which
is paid to a woman for ravishing her: (Lth, Msb,
K:) or what is given to a female slave who has
been ravished, like a dowry in the like case to a
free woman: (Ahmad Ibn-Hambal:) so called
because devirgination wounds the object of it:
pl. أَعْقَارٌ. (IAth, TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, in consequence
of frequency of usage, (Msb,) A woman's dowry;
(Msb, K;) i. q. بُضْعُهَا. (O.) ―
-b3-  Also The exploration of a woman to see if she be a virgin or
not: (Kh, O, K, TA:) but Az says that this is
unknown. (TA.) [Perhaps it is a meaning inferred from what here follows.] ―
-b4-  بَيْضَةُ العُقْرِ is
That [egg] with which a woman is tested on the
occasion of devirgination: (K: [but what is
meant by this, I have not been able to learn:])
or the first egg of the hen; (K, TA;) because it
wounds her: (TA:) or the last egg of the hen;
(O, K, TA;) when she is old and weak: (TA:)
or the egg of the cock, which [they say] he lays
once in the year, (O, K,) [or once in his life, for]
they assert that it is the egg of the cock, because
he lays, in his life, one egg, somewhat inclining to
length; so called because the virginity of the girl,
or young woman, is tested with it: hence, they
say of a thing given one time [only], كَانَتْ بَيْضَةَ
العُقْرِ: or, as some say, it is like the phrases بَيْضُ
الأَنُوقِ and الأَبْلَقُ العَقُوقُ; so that it is a phrase
proverbially used as applied to a thing that never
is: (S, O:) accord. to A'Obeyd, when a niggard
gives once, and not again, one says [of the gift],
كَانَتْ بَيْضَةَ الدِّيكِ; and when he gives a thing,
and then stops doing so, one says of the last time
[of his giving], كَانَتْ بَيْضَةَ العُقْرِ. (TA.) One
says also, كَانَ ذٰلِكَ بَيْضَةَ العُقْرِ meaning * That
happened once, not a second time. (TA.) And
بَيْضَةُ العُقْرِ means also (tropical:)  He who has no offspring.
(K, TA. [See also عَاقِرٌ.]) And (assumed tropical:)  He who stands
another in no stead. (TA.)

land; syn. طُعْمَةٌ; (O, K;) and so ↓ عُقْرَةٌ. (K.

the K “ and ”) the hinder part of a trough, or
tank, for watering beasts &c., (S, K, TA,) where
the camels stand when they come to water; as
also ↓ عُقُرٌ: (S:) or the station of the drinker;
(K;) as in all the copies of the K; but accord.
to the T and Nh, the station of the animals
drinking: (TA:) or the place where the bucket
is emptied, at the hinder part of the trough, or
tank; the place at the fore part being called its
إِزَآء: (IAar:) pl. أَعْقَارٌ. (S, O.) It is said in a
prov., إِنَّمَا يُهْدَمُ الحَوْضُ مِنْ عُقْرِهِ [lit., The trough,
or tank, for watering beasts &c. is demolished only
by commencing from its hinder part]; meaning,
an affair is performed only by setting about it in
the proper way. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also The part of a
well where the fore feet of the animals watering
stand when they drink. (TA.) ―
-b4-  See also عَقْرٌ,

she-camel that will not drink save from fear: but
accord. to IAar [and the S and O], that will not
drink save from the عُقْر of the trough, or tank;
and أَزِيَةٌ signifies one “ that will not drink save
from its إِزَآء,” i. e. “ from its fore part. ” (TA.)

-A2-
Also A kind of bead (خَرَزَةٌ, S, O, K) which a
woman binds upon her flanks, in order that she
may not conceive; (T, S, O;) or which a woman
bears, or carries, in order that she may not bear
offspring: (K:) accord. to IAar, a kind of bead
which is hung upon her who is barren, in order
that she may bear offspring; but this is strange.
(TA.) Hence the saying, عُقَرَةُ العِلْمِ النِّسْيَانُ

voice: the origin of the saying was this: a man

any one who raised his voice: (S, O:) or it is
expl. thus: a man had one of his limbs wounded,

singing in driving them, and which had become
dispersed from him; so he raised his voice, crying, by reason of the wound; and his camels,
