un., (TA,) and مَعَادٌ, (K, TA,) He, or it, returned to it, (S, A, O, K, * TA,) namely, a thing:
(TA:) or, accord. to some, the verb is differently
used with فِى and with other preps.: (MF, TA:)
[with فى it seems generally to imply some degree
of continuance, in addition to the simple meaning
of the verb alone:] one says, عاد الكَلْبُ فِى قَيْئِهِ
The dog returned to his vomit: (Msb in art. رجع:)
and عاد لَهُ بَعْدَ مَا كَانَ أَعْرَضَ عَنْهُ [He returned

a thing or state or condition; syn. صَارَ إِليْهِ;

and the verb is trans. by means of عَلَى and فِى
as well as إِلَى and لِ, and also by itself: (Mgh:)
لَتَعُودُنَّ فِى مِلَّتِنَا, in the Kur [vii. 86 and xiv. 16],
means Ye shall assuredly come to our religion;
for the words relate to the apostle: (O, * and Bd
in xiv. 16:) or the words relate to the apostle
and to those who believed with him, the latter
being made to have a predominant influence upon
the verb; (Bd in vii. 86 and xiv. 16, and Jel in
vii. 86;) the meaning being ye shall assuredly
return to our religion: (Bd * and Jel in vii. 86:)
or the meaning is, ye shall assuredly enter the
communion of our religion; the verb here signifying beginning: and the saying, of a poet,
وَعَادَ الرَّأْسُ مِنِّى كَالثَّغَامِ
is cited as an ex. [i. e. as meaning And my head
began to be white like the plant called ثغام]: or
the meaning in this instance may be, became like
the ثغام: (MF, TA:) you say also, عاد كَذَا

أَنَّ هٰذَا اللَّبَنَ يَعُودُ قَطِرَانًا [I wish that this milk
would become tar]. (O, TA.) عاد is also used as
an incomplete [i. e. a non-attributive] verb in the
sense of كَانَ [He, or it, was], requiring an
enunciative [generally] on the condition of its

with her, when her youth was fresh and her time
of life was deemed comely]; the meaning being

also an ex. in a verse cited voce مَطْمَعَةٌ. But the
first of the significations mentioned in this art. is
that which is most common. Hence several
phrases mentioned below voce عَوْدٌ. And hence

particle in the sense of إِنَّ, governing an accus.
case, on the condition of its being preceded by a

thy father was waking, or remaining awake, by
night]: ―

denotes an answer, in the sense of a proposition
rendered negative by means of لم or of ما, only;

and thou answerest, عَادِنِنى, meaning Verily I
(إِنَّنِى) did not perform, or have not performed,
the act of prayer: ―

modes are chaste when عَادِ is used in the sense of
إِنَّ: ―
