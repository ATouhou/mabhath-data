عَمِرَ, aor.
عَمَرَ; (S, O, Msb, K;) and عَمَرَ,
aor.
عَمُرَ (K) and
عَمِرَ; (Sb, K;) inf. n. عَمْرٌ (S, O,
Msb, K) and عُمْرٌ, (S, O, Msb,) both anomalous,
as inf. ns. of عَمِرَ, for by rule the inf. n. should be
عَمَرٌ, (S,) but عَمَرٌ is also an inf. n., (TA,) and
عُمُرٌ, which is the most chaste, (O,) and عَمَارَةٌ;
(K;) He lived, (S, O,) or continued in life (بَقِىَ),
(K,) long, or a long time; (S, O, K; *) his life
was, or became, long: (Msb:) and عَمِرَ he grew
old. (TA.) ―
-b2-  عَمَرَ بِمَكَانٍ He remained, continued, stayed, resided, dwelt, or abode, in a place.
(B, TA.)
-A2-  عَمَرَ, aor.
عَمُرَ, inf. n. عَمْرٌ, (Msb,) or
عِمَارَةٌ and عُمْرَانٌ, (MA,) It (a place of abode)
became inhabited; (MA, Msb;) بِأَهْلهِ [by its
people]: (Msb:) [it became peopled, well peopled,
well stocked with people and the like, in a flourishing state, in a state the contrary of desolate or
waste or ruined, or in a state of good repair:]
and in like manner you say, عَمِرَتِ الدَّارُ, aor.
عَمَرَ,
inf. n. عَمْرٌ, the house became inhabited [&c.].
(MA.) ―
-b2-  [You say also, عَمَرَتِ الأَرْضُ The land
became inhabited, peopled, well stocked with people

عَمُرَ; and عَمِرَ, aor.
عَمَرَ;

عَمُرَ; (Sb, K;) inf. n. عِمَارَةٌ;
(K; [so in most copies; in the TA, عَمَارَةٌ, and
there said to be inf. n. of عَمُرَ; but, I think,
erroneously;]) i. q. صَارَ عَامِرًا [The property, consisting of camels or the like, became in a flourishing state]; (K;) the property became much; the
camels, or the like, became many, or numerous.
(Sgh.)
-A3-  عَمَرَهُ, (Msb, K,) aor.
عَمُرَ, (TA,) inf. n.
عِمَارَةٌ (K [so in most copies, but in the TA, عَمَارَةٌ,
with fet-h, which I think erroneous;]) and عُمُورٌ
(K) and عُمْرَانٌ, (TA,) He inhabited it; remained, continued, stayed, resided, dwelt, or
abode, in it; namely, a place of abode: (Msb:)
he kept to it; namely, his property, or his camels
or the like, and his house, or tent: (K:) one
should not say, of a man, مَنْزِلِهُ ↓ أَعْمَرَ, with ا.
(Az, TA.) إِنَّمَا يَعْمُرُ مَسَاجِدَ اللّٰهِ, in the Kur
[ix. 18], signifies Only he shall abide in the
mosques, or places of worship, of God: or shall
visit them: (TA:) see 8: but Z says, I know
not عَمَرَ as occurring in the sense of اعتمر [he
visited]: (TA:) or shall enter them and sit in
them: (Jel:) or the verb in the above-cited
phrase of the Kur has another signification,
which see below. (TA.)
-A4-  عَمَرَهُ is also syn.
with عَمَّرَهُ, in the first of the senses expl. below:
see 2.
-A5-  عَمَرَ اللّٰهُ بِكَ مَنْزِلَكَ, (AZ, S, O, K, *)
aor.
عَمُرَ, (TA,) inf. n. عِمَارَةٌ; (K;) and ↓ أَعْمَرَهُ;
(AZ, S, O, K;) May God make thy place of
abode to become peopled, [or well peopled, well
stocked with people and the like, in a flourishing
state, in a state the contrary of ruined or waste
or desolate, or in a state of good repair,] by thee
[or by thy means]: (K, * TA:) but AZ says that
one should not say, of a man, مَنْزِلَهُ ↓ أَعْمَرَ, with ا.
(S.) ―
-b2-  عَمَرَ الخَرَابَ, aor. and inf. n. as above, [He
made the ruin, or waste, or the like, to become in
a state of good repair, in a state the contrary of
ruined or waste or desolate.] (S, O, TA.) ―
-b3-  [عَمَرَ
الأَرْضَ, aor. and inf. n. as above, He peopled the
land; stocked it well with people and camels and
the like; colonized it; cultivated it, or cultivated

state the contrary of waste.] ―
-b4-  And عَمَرَ البِنَآءَ,
aor. and inf. n. as above, He kept the building in
a good state; syn. حَفِظَهُ. (TA.) So accord. to
some, in the Kur, إِنَّمَا يَعْمُرُ مَسَاجِدَ اللّٰهِ, [quoted
above,] Only he shall keep in a good state [or in
repair] the mosques, or places of worship, of God:
(TA:) among the significations of the verb as
here used, are these; he shall adorn them with
carpets or the like, and light them with lamps,
and continue the performance of religious worship
and praise and the study of science in them, and
guard them from [desecration by] that for which
they are not built, such as worldly discourse. (Bd.)
―
-b5-  عَمَرَ الدَّارَ, aor.
عَمُرَ, inf. n. عَمْرٌ [and عِمَارَةٌ,
(MA,) or this, accord. to the Msb, is a simple
subst.], He built the house. (Msb.) [And] He
made the house to be inhabited; he peopled it;
(MA;) [or made it to be well stocked with people
and the like, or in a flourishing state, or in a state
of good repair.] ―
-b6-  عَمَرَ الخَيْرَ, aor.
عَمُرَ, inf. n. عَمْرٌ
and عِمَارَةٌ, [app., He instituted what was good:
or perhaps, he cultivated, or promoted, it: or he
kept to it; or observed it; or regarded it.] (Az,
TA.)
-A6-  عَمَرَ رَبَّهُ, (IAar, K,) aor.
عَمُرَ, (IAar, O,)
[inf. n. عِمَارَةٌ,] He served, or worshipped, his
Lord; (IAar, K;) he prayed and fasted. (Ks,
Lh, O, K.) You say تَرَكْتُ فُلَانًا يَعْمُرُ رَبَّهُ I left
such a one worshipping his Lord, praying and
fasting. (TA.)
2
عَمَّرَهُ اللّٰهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَعْمِيرٌ; (S,
Msb;) and ↓ عَمَرَهُ, (Msb, K,) aor.
عَمُرَ, (Msb,)
inf. n. عَمْرٌ; (TA;) God lengthened, or prolonged,
his life; (S, O, Msb, TA;) made him to continue
in life; preserved him alive; (K, TA;) as also
↓ استعمرهُ. (O and Bd in xi. 64.) It is said in
the Kur [xxxv. 12], وَمَا يُعَمَّرُ مِنْ مُعَمَّرٍ وَلَا يُنْقَصُ
إِلَّا فِى كِتَابٍ, i. e., No one whose life is prolonged
has life prolonged, nor is aught diminished of his,
meaning another's, life, but it is recorded in a
writing: (I'Ab, Fr, * O: *) or the meaning is, nor
does aught pass of his, i. e. the same person's,
life: (Sa'eed Ibn-Jubeyr:) both these explanations are good; but the former seems more probably correct. (Az, TA.) ―
-b2-  عمّر نَفْسَهُ He determined for himself, or assigned to himself, a limited
life. (K.) ―
-b3-  عمّر اللّٰهَ, inf. n. تَعْمِيرٌ, He acknowledged the everlasting existence of God. (S, TA.)
―
-b4-  عَمَّرْتُكَ اللّٰهَ I ask, or beg, God to prolong thy
life: (Ks, O, TA:) or I remind thee of God.
(TA, app. on the authority of Mbr.) [It also
seems to signify I swear to thee by the everlasting
existence of God. See عَمْرَ اللّٰهِ.] ―
-b5-  أُعَمِّرُكَ اللّٰهَُ أَنْ
تَفْعَلَ كَذَا I adjure thee by God, and beg thee by
the length of thy life, that thou do such a thing.
(K, * TA.) ―
-b6-  See also 4.
-A2-  عَمَّرَ خِبَآءً بِمَا احْتَاجَ إِلَيْهِ
[He furnished a tent with what he required].
(Msb in art. بنى.)

عَامَرْتُهُ طُولَ حَيَاتِهِ [I lived with him for the
length of his life]. (M in art. بلو.)

أَعْمَرَ see 1, in three places. ―
-b2-  اعمرهُ المَكَانَ, (K,)
and فِيهِ ↓ استعمرهُ, (S, K,) i. q. جَعَلَهُ يَعْمُرُهُ (K)
or جعله عَامِرَهُ (S) [He made him to inhabit the
place, or to people, or colonize, or cultivate, it].
So the latter signifies in the Kur [xi. 64],
فِيهَا ↓ وَاسْتَعْمَرَكُمْ (S) And He hath made you to
dwell therein: (O, Jel:) or hath required of you
to inhabit it, or to people it, &c.: (Z:) or hath
enabled and commanded you to do so: (Bd:)
or hath permitted you to do so, and to fetch
out by labour, or art, your food [for قومكم in the
L and TA, I read قُوتكم, and this is evidently the
right,] from it: (TA:) or hath given you your
houses therein for your lives; or made you to
dwell in them during your lives, and then to leave
them to others: (Bd:) or hath prolonged your
lives therein. (Ibn-'Arafeh, O.) ―
-b3-  أَعْمَرْتُهُ دَارًا,
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, *) or أَرْضًا, or إِبِلًا, (S, O,)
and إِيَّاهَا ↓ عَمَّرْتُهُ, (K, *) I assigned to him the house
for his life, (Msb, K,) or for my life, (K,) to inhabit it for that period; (Msb, TA;) I said to
him, of a house, (S, Mgh, O,) or of land, or of
camels, (S, O,) It is thine, (S, Mgh, O,) or they
are thine, (S, O,) for my life, (S, Mgh, O,) or
for thy life, and when thou diest it returns, or
they return, to me. (S, O.) The doing so is forbidden. (Mgh, TA.) [See also عُمْرَى: and see
أَرْقَبَ, and رُقْبَى.] ―
-b4-  اعمر الأَرْضَ He found the
land to be عَامِرَة, (S, O, K,) i. e., peopled [and
cultivated, or in a flourishing state]. (TA.) ―
-b5-
اعمر عَلَيْهِ He rendered him rich; made him to be
possessed of competence or sufficiency, to be without
wants, or to have few wants. (K.)
-A2-  اعمرهُ He
aided him to perform the visit called عُمْرَة;
(Mgh, O, K;) [said to be] on the authority of
analogy; not on that of hearsay; (Mgh;) but
occurring in a trad.: (Mgh, TA:) or he made
him to perform that visit. (IKtt, Msb.)
-A3-  See
also 8.
8
اعتمر He visited. (Msb, K: in some copies
of the K اعتمرهُ.) You say, اعتمرهُ, (S, O,) and
↓ اعمرهُ, (ISk, Msb,) He visited him, or it; (S,
O;) he repaired, or betook himself, to him, or it;
(ISk, S, O, Msb;) as also ↓ عَمَرَهُ, accord. to one
explanation of a passage in the Kur ix. 18,
quoted above: [see 1:] but Z says, I know not
عَمَرَ as occurring in the sense of اعتمر. (TA.) ―
-b2-
He performed the religious visit called عُمْرَة. (O,
TA.) You say اعتمر فِى الحَجِّ [He performed
the visit so called in the pilgrimage]. (S.) ―
-b3-
اعتمر أَمْرًا He betook himself to a thing, or an
affair; as, for instance, a warring and plundering expedition; aimed at it; purposed it. (TA.)
-A2-  Also He attired his head (i. e. his own head)
with an عَمَارَة, i. e., a turban, &c. (S, K.)
10
إِسْتَعْمَرَ see 2: ―
-b2-  and also 4, in two places.
عَمْرٌ and ↓ عُمْرٌ are both inf. ns., signifying the
same. (S, O.) [See 1. As such, the former is
the more common.] And both of these words,
(Mgh, K, &c.,) and ↓ عُمُرٌ, (K, &c.,) [used as
simple substs., or abstract ns., in which case the
second is more common than the first, except in
forms of swearing, in which the former is used,
and the third is more chaste than the second,]
signify Life; (Msb, K;) [the age to which the
life extends;] the period during which the body is
inhabited by life: so that it denotes less than
بَقَآءٌ: wherefore the latter is [frequently] used as
an attribute of God; but عمر is seldom used as
such: (Er-Rághib, B:) pl. أَعْمَارٌ. (K.) You
say ↓ أَطَالَ اللّٰهُ عُمُرَكَ and عَمْرَكَ [May God prolong thy life]. (S, O.) In a form of swearing,
عَمْر only is used. (S.) [In a case of this kind,
when ل is not prefixed to it, it is in the accus.
case, as will be shown and expl. below: but when
ل is prefixed to it, it is in the nom.] You say
لَعَمْرُكَ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ, meaning By thy life, I will assuredly do [such a thing]. (Msb.) لَعَمْرُكَ occurs
in the Kur xv. 72, and means By thy life: (I'Ab,
Akh, Bd, Jel:) and ↓ لَعَمَرُكَ is a dial. var., mentioned by Yoo: (O:) or the former, accord. to
the grammarians, means by thy religion: (AHeyth,
O:) and [in like manner] لَعَمْرِى, and ↓ لَعَمَرِى,
[by my life, or] by my religion. (K.) لَعَمْرُكَ is
an inchoative, of which the enunciative, مَا أُقْسِمُ
بِهِ, [that by which I swear, so that the entire
phrase means thy life is that by which I swear,]
is understood; therefore it is in the nom. case:
(IJ, TA:) or the complete phrase is وَعَمْرِكَ
فَلَعَمْرُكَ عَظِيمٌ [by thy life, &c.: and thy life is of
great account]. (Fr, as related by A'Obeyd.)
You say also لَعَمْرُ أَبِيكَ الخَيْرَ, and الخَيْرِ; the
former meaning By thy father's instituting, or
promoting, or keeping to, or observing, or regarding, what is good; الخير being the objective complement of عمر, from عَمَرَ الخَيْرَ, aor.
عَمُرَ, inf. n.
عَمْرٌ and عِمَارَةٌ; [see 1;] but in the latter case,
الخَيْرِ is an epithet added to أَبِيكَ [so that the
meaning is by the life of thy good father].
(AHeyth, Az, O, TA.) [See also art. خير.]
You also say لَعَمْرُ اللّٰهِ, meaning By the everlasting existence of God; (S, O, K;) عمر being here
in the nom. case as an inchoative, with ل prefixed
to it as a corroborative of the inchoative state:
the enunciative is understood; the complete
phrase being لَعَمْرُ اللّٰهِ قَسَمِى or مَا أُقْسِمُ بِهِ [the
everlasting existence of God is my oath, or that by
which I swear]. (S, O.) This expression is forbidden in a trad., (K,) because عَمْرٌ [properly]
means the life of the body: (TA:) [but] لَعَمْرُ
إِلٰهِكَ, meaning By the everlasting existence of thy
God, occurs in a trad. (TA.) When you do
not prefix ل, you make it to be in the accus. case,
as an inf. n.: thus you say, عمْرَ اللّٰهِ مَا فَعَلْتُ كَذَا
(S, O, K) I swear by the everlasting existence of
God, I did not so: (S, O:) and عَمْرَكَ اللّٰهَ مَا
فَعَلْتُ كَذَا (S, O, K, [in the CK اللّٰهُ, but this is
a mistake,]) By thine acknowledgment of the
everlasting existence of God, I did not so: (S,
O:) or the original thereof is عَمَّرْتُكَ اللّٰهَ تَعْمِيرًا,
(O, K,) i. e., I ask, or beg, God to prolong thy
life: (Ks, O:) [and it is said in the S that عَمْرَكَ
اللّٰهَ sometimes has this signification:] and in like
manner عَمْرَكَ اللّٰهَ لَا أَفْعَلُ ذَاكَ means I beg God
to prolong thy life: I will not do that: or it may
be a form of oath without و [for وَعَمْرِكَ]: (Ks:)
and you say عَمْرَكَ اللّٰهَ اِفْعَلْ كَذَا and إِلَّا فَعَلْتَ
كَذَا [and إِلَّا مَا فَعَلْتَ كَذَا By thine acknowledgment of the everlasting existence of God, &c.,
do thou so]: (TA:) or عَمْرَكَ اللّٰهَ signifies by thy
worship of God: (AHeyth:) or I remind thee,
reminding thee, of God. (K.) Mbr says of this
phrase, عمرك اللّٰه, that عمر may be in the accus.
case on account of a verb understood; [such, for
instance, as أُذَكِّرُكَ;] or by reason of و suppressed, the complete phrase being وَعَمْرِكَ اللّٰهَ; or
as being for [the inf. n.] تَعْمِير. (TA.) It may
also be [found written] عَمْرَ اللّٰهَ; but this is bad.
(Ks.) Some of the Arabs, for لَعَمْرُكَ, said
رَعَمْلُكَ. (Az.) ―
-b2-  عَمْرًا وَشَبَابًا: see قُحَابٌ.
-A2-  عَمْرٌ
(AHeyth, K) and ↓ عَمَرٌ (K) signify Religion;
(AHeyth, K;) as in the phrases لَعَمْرِى and
↓ لَعَمَرِى (K) and لَعَمْرُكَ (AHeyth) [mentioned above].
-A3-  Also عَمْرٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and
↓ عُمْرٌ (IAth, O, K) The flesh that is between the
teeth: (S, O, Msb, K:) or the pendent piece of
flesh between the teeth: (Az, Msb:) or the flesh
that is between the places in which the teeth are
set: (TA:) or the flesh of the gum: (K:) or the
flesh of the gum that runs between any two teeth:
(TA:) or what appears of the gum: (Kh, Msb:)
or (so accord. to the TA, but in the K “ and ”)
anything of an oblong shape between two teeth:
(K:) pl. عُمُورٌ: (S, O, Msb, K:) which some explain as signifying the places whence the teeth
grow. (TA.) It is said in a trad., أَوْصَانِى جِبْرِيلُ
بِالسِّوَاكِ حَتَّى خَشِيتُ عَلَى عُمُورِى [Gabriel enjoined me to make use of the tooth-stick so that I
feared for my عمور]. (O, TA.)
-A4-  أُمُّ عَمْرٍو:
see عَامِرٌ.
عُمْرٌ: see عَمْرٌ, in two places.
عَمَرٌ: see عَمْرٌ, in four places.
عُمُرٌ: see عَمْرٌ, in two places.
عَمْرَةٌ: see عَمَارَةٌ.
-A2-  أَبُو عَمْرَةَ means Bankruptcy,
insolvency, or the state of having no property remaining; (Lth, O, K;) which is said to be thus
called because it was the name of an envoy of
El-Mukhtár the son of Aboo-'Obeyd, on the
occasion of whose alighting at the abode of a
people, slaughter and war used to befall them:
(Lth, O, K: *) ―
-b2-  and (K) hunger. (IAar, K.)
عُمْرَةٌ A visit, or a visiting: (S, Msb, K:) or
a visit in which is the cultivation (عِمَارَة) of love
or affection: (TA:) or a repairing to an inhabited, or a peopled, place: this is the primary
signification. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  Hence the عُمْرَة in pilgrimage [and at any time]; (S, O; *) i. e. [A
religious visit to the sacred places at Mekkeh,
with the performance of the ceremony of الإِحْرَام,]
the circuiting round the Kaabeh, and the going
to and fro between Es-Safà and El-Marweh:
الحَجُّ [differs from it inasmuch as it is at a particular time of the year and] is not complete without the halting at 'Arafát on the day of 'Arafeh:
(Zj, TA:) the عُمْرَة is the minor pilgrimage (الحَجُّ
الأَصْغَرُ); (Msb, and Kull p. 168;) what is commonly termed الحَجُّ being called sometimes the
greater pilgrimage (الحَجُّ الأَكْبَرُ): (Kull:) pl.
عُمَرٌ (S, O, Msb) and عُمَرَاتٌ or عُمُرَاتٌ or عُمْرَاتٌ.
(Msb.) ―
-b3-  Also A man's going in to his [newlymarried] wife in the abode of her family: (IAar,
S, K:) if he removes her to his own family, the
act is termed عُرْسٌ. (IAar, S.)
عُمْرَى a subst., (إِسْمٌ [strangely read by Golius
أَسْمَرُ], S, O,) or an inf. n., (TA,) [or rather a quasiinf. n.,] from أَعْمَرَهُ دَارًا and the like; (S, O, TA;)
A man's assigning to another a house for the life
of the latter, or for the life of the former;
(accord. to the explanation of the verb in the
K;) a man's saying to another, of a house, or of
land, or of camels, It is thine, or they are thine,
for my life, or for thy life, and when thou diest
it returns, or they return, to me; (accord. to the
explanation of the verb in the S and Mgh and
O;) a man's giving to another a house, and saying to him, This is thine for thy life, or for my
life: (Th, in TA: [in which is added, “whichever of us dies,” ايّنا مات, but this I consider a
mistake for إِذَا مَاتَ, “when he dies,”) “ the
house is given to his family: ”]) so they used to
do in the Time of Ignorance: (TA:) but some
of the Muslim lawyers hold the gift to be absolute, and the condition to be null. (TA, &c.) ―
-b2-
Also [The property, or house, &c., so given;] what
is assigned, or given, to another for the period of
his life, or for that of the life of the giver. (K.)
[See also رُقْبَى.]
عُمْرِىٌّ, applied to trees (شَجَر), Old; (K;) a
rel. n. from عُمْرٌ: (TA:) عُمْرِيَّةٌ, [the fem.,] applied
to a tree (شَجَرَة), signifies great and old, having
had a long life: (IAth, TA:) or the former, the
[species of lote-tree called] سِدْر, that grows upon
the rivers (O, K) and imbibes the water; as also
عُبْرِىٌّ: (O:) or, accord, to Abu-l-'Ameythel [or
'Omeythil] El-Aarábee, the old, whether on a
river or not; (O, TA;) and in like manner says
As, the old of the سِدْر, whether on a river or
not; and the ضَال is the recent thereof: some
say that the م is a substitute for the ب in عُبْرِىٌّ
[q. v.]. (TA.)
الفَرِيضَةُ العُمَرِيَّةُ: see المُشَرَّكَةُ.
عُمْرَانٌ [an inf. n. of عَمَرَ: ―
-b2-  and of عَمَرَهُ: ―
-b3-
then app. used as an epithet syn. with عَامِرٌ, q. v.:
(of which it is also a pl.:) ―
-b4-  and then as an
epithet in which the quality of a subst. is predominant; meaning A land, or house, inhabited,
peopled, well people, well stocked with people and
the like, in a flourishing state, in a state the contrary of desolate or waste or ruined; a land colo-
nized, cultivated, or well cultivated; a house in a
state of good repair: such seems to be meant in
the JK and A and K, in art. خرب, where, as in
the O in this art., it is said to be contr. of خَرَابٌ,
q. v.] ―
-b5-  It is also a subst. signifying بُنْيَانٌ [A
building; a structure; and edifice: or perhaps
the act of building]. (Msb.) [See also عِمَارَةٌ. ―
-b6-
It is also a pl. of عَامِرٌ, q. v.]
عَمَارٌ: see عَمَارَةٌ, in three places.
عَمِيرٌ: see عَامِرٌ.
أَبُو عُمَيْرِ The ذَكَر. (K; and TA voce شَامَ, q. v.,

عَمَارَةٌ Anything (AO, S, O, K) which one puts,
(S, O,) or which a chief puts, (TA,) upon his
head, such as a turban, and a قَلَنْسُوَة, and a crown,
&c., (AO, S, O, K,) as a sign of headship, and
for keeping it in mind; (TA;) as also ↓ عَمْرَةٌ
(K) and ↓ عَمَارٌ: (S, O, * TA:) which last [is app.
a coll. gen. n., of which عَمَارَةٌ is the n. un., and]
also signifies any sweet-smelling plant (رَيْحَان)
which a chief puts upon his head for the same
purpose: and hence, (tropical:)  any such plant, absolutely:
(B:) or any such plant with which a drinkingchamber is adorned, (S, K,) called by the Persians
مَيْوَرَانْ; when any one comes in to the people there
assembled, they raise somewhat thereof with their
hands, and salute him with it, wishing him a long
life: so, accord. to some, in a verse of El-Aashà,
which see below: (S:) or it there signifies crowns
of such plants, which they put upon their heads,
as the foreigners (العَجَم) do; but ISd says, “I
know not how this is: ” or the myrtle; syn. آس:
(TA:) and عَمَارةٌ signifies a plant of that kind,
with which one used to salute a king, saying, May
God prolong thy life: or, as some say, a raising
of the voice, saying so: (Az, TA:) a salutation;
(K;) said to mean, may God prolong thy life;
(TA;) as also ↓ عَمَارٌ (S, K) and ↓ عِمَارَةٌ; (L;)
but Az says that this explanation is not valid.
(TA.) El-Aashà says,
فَلَمَّا أَتَانَا بُعَيْدَ الكَرَى
↓ سَجَدْنَا لَهُ وَرَفَعْنَا العَمَارَا
[And when he came to us, a little after slumber,
we prostrated ourselves to him, and] we put the
turbans from our heads, in honour of him: (S:)
but IB says that, accord. to this explanation, the
correct reading is وَضَعْنَا العَمَارَا: (TA:) or the
former reading means, we raised our voices with
prayer for him, and said, May God prolong thy
life: or we raised the sweet-smelling plants: &c.:
see above. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also عَمَارَةٌ, (K,) or
↓ عِمَارَةٌ, (O,) An ornamented piece of cloth which
is sewed upon a مِظّلَّة, [by which is meant a kind
of tent,] (O, K, TA,) i. e. sewed to the طَرِيقَة [q. v.],
on each side of the tent-pole, (O,) as a sign of
headship. (TA.)
-A2-  See also عِمَارَةٌ.
عُمَارَةٌ Hire, pay, or wages, of, or for, عِمَارَة as
signifying مَا يُعْمَرُ بِهِ المَكَانُ [see below]. (K,
TA.)
عِمَارَةٌ [is an inf. n.: and often signifies Habitation and cultivation; or a good state of habitation
and cultivation: ―
-b2-  and is also expl. as signifying]
مَا يُعْمَرُ بِهِ المَكَانُ [That by which a place is rendered inhabited, peopled, well stocked with people
and the like, colonized, cultivated, well cultivated,
in a flourishing state, or in a state the contrary of
desolate or waste or ruined; app. meaning, work,
or labour, by which a place is rendered so; as it
is immediately added in the K that عُمَارَةٌ signifies
hire, pay, or wages, of it, or for it; and the explanation which I have here given is agreeable
with ancient and modern usage; to which it
may be further added, that the measure (فِعَالَةٌ)
is common to words signifying arts, occupations,
or employments, as زِرَاعَةٌ and فِلَاحَةٌ &c.]. (K,
TA.) ―
-b3-  Also a subst. from عَمَرَ الدَّارَ. (Msb.)
[It has two significations, either of which may
be meant in the Msb: The act, or art, of building a house: ―

edifice: generally, accord. to modern usage, a
public edifice: pl. عَمَائِرُ. See also عُمْرَانٌ.]
-A2-
Also The breast of a man. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence,
(TA,) عِمَارَةٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ عَمَارَةٌ, (Msb,
K,) the latter allowed by Kh, (O,) but the former
is the more common, (Msb,) A great tribe, syn.
قِبِيلَةٌ عَظِيمَةٌ, (Msb,) or حَىٌّ عَظِيمٌ, (O, K, TA,)
that subsists by itself, migrating by itself, and
abiding by itself, and seeking pasturage by itself:
(O, TA:) or it is called by the former name because it peoples a land; and by the latter, because
complex like a turban; (TA;) and ↓ عَمِيرَةٌ signifies the same; or, as some say, all signify a بَطْن:
(Ham p. 682:) or i. q. قَبِيلَةٌ and عَشِيرَةٌ: (S, O:)
or less than a قبيلة: (O, K:) or less than a قبيلة
and more than a بَطْن: (IAth, TA:) [see also
شَعْبٌ:] or a body of men by which a place is
peopled: (B, TA:) pl. عَمَائِرُ. (TA.)

رِجَالٍ قَتْلَى [Hide thyself, O Umm-'Ámir: rejoice
thou at the news of locusts cohering, and the glands
of the penes of slain men: (in this prov., for كَمِّ, in
the TA, I have substituted كَمَرٍ, which is the
reading in variations of the prov.: see Freytag's
Arab. Prov., i. 431:)] this being said by a man,
[it is asserted that] the animal becomes obsequious
to him, so that he muzzles it, and then drags it
forth; for the hyena, says Az, is proverbial for
its stupidity, and for its being beguiled with soft
speech. (TA.) It is called امّ عامر, as though its
young one were called عَامِرٌ, and it is so called by
a Hudhalee poet: (L:) or its whelp is called
