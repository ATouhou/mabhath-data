عَافَتِ الطَّيْرُ, (Sh, O, K,) aor. تَعُوفُ, inf. n.
عَوْفٌ, (Sh, O,) The birds circled over a thing,
(Sh, O, K,) or over the water, or over carcasses
or corpses: or circled over a thing, going to and
fro and not going away, desiring to alight: (K:)
AA says that the medial radical is و; others say
that it is ى, as will be shown in art. عيف. (TA.)
-A2-  And عَافَ He (a man, TA) kept, or clave, to
the trees, or plants, called عَوْف. (O, K, * TA.)

تعوّف He (a lion) sought, or sought for or
after, the prey, by night. (TA.) [It is used as

عَافٌ i. q. سَهْلٌ [A soft tract, or a plain, &c.].
(O, K.)
عَوْفٌ A state, condition, or case. (S, O, K.)
So in the saying, نَعِمَ عَوْفُكَ [May thy state, &c.,
be good, or pleasant]. (S, O.) One says also,
أَصْبَحَ فُلَانٌ بِعَوْفِ سَوْءٍ, and بِعَوْفِ خَيْرٍ, meaning
[Such a one entered upon the morning, or, simply,
became,] in an evil state, and in a good state: or,
accord. to some of the lexicologists, one should
not say بِعَوْفِ خَيْرٍ, but only شَرٍّ [or سَوْءٍ]. (IDrd,
O.) ―
-b2-  Also Fortune; syn. جَدٌّ and حَظٌّ. (O, K.)
And so, accord. to some, in the saying, نَعِمَ عَوْفُكَ
[i. e. May thy fortune be good]. (O, TA.) ―
-b3-
And i. q. طَائِرٌ [as meaning An omen]. (K, TA.)
And thus it is said to signify in the form of
prayer above mentioned: (TA:) [for,] as some
say, the meaning is, نَعِمَ طَيْرُكَ [May thy omen
be good]. (O, TA.) ―
-b4-  And The ذَكَر. (O, K.)
One says to a man on the morning after his first
going in to his wife, نَعِمَ عَوْفُكَ, meaning thereby
the ذَكَر [i. e. May thy ذكر be in a good state].
(O, TA.) A'Obeyd says, Some men used to
explain (يَتَأَوَّلُ [for which يَتَنَاوَلُ is erroneously put
in the O]) العَوْف as the فَرْج [meaning the ذَكَر],
and I mentioned it to AA, and he disapproved it:
(S, O, TA:) but a verse has been cited in which
عَوْفِى [certainly] means ذَكَرِى. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And
A guest. (Lth, O, K.) And thus it has been
expl. as used in the saying, نَعِمَ عَوْفُكَ. (O, *
TA.) ―
-b6-  And The cock. (O, K.) ―
-b7-  And The
lion: because he seeks his prey (↓ يَتَعَوَّفُ) by

The جَرَادَة, (S, O,) [i. e.] the female of the جَرَاد
[or locust]. (K.) And أَبُو عَوْفٍ The جَرَاد [meaning the male locust]. (Az, O, K.)
-A2-  Also (i. e.
عَوْفٌ) a good manner of tending or pasturing
[cattle]: (O, K:) [or rather, simply,] the tending
or pasturing [cattle]: so in the saying, إِنَّهُ لَحَسَنُ
العَوْفِ فِى إِبِلِهِ [Verily he is one who has a good
quality of tending, or pasturing, in respect of his
camels]. (TA.)
عُوَافٌ: see عُوَافَةٌ.
أُمُّ عُوَيْفٍ A small creeping thing (دُوَيَّبَةٌ), other
than the جَرَادَة [which is termed أُمُّ عَوْفٍ]. (TA.)
―
-b2-  And, accord. to AHát, أَبُو عَوْفٍ A species of
the [beetles called] جِعْلَان [pl. of جُعَلٌ]: it is a
