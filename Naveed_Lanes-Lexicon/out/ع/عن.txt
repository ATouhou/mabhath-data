عن1
عَنَّ, aor.
عَنِ3َ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and
عَنُ3َ, (S,
Msb, K,) the former accord. to some relaters, and
the latter accord. to others, occurring in a verse
of a Hudhalee, (TA,) inf. n. عَنَنٌ (S, Msb, K)
and عَنٌّ (Msb, K) and عُنُونٌ, the first of which
is also [or is properly] a simple subst., (K, [and
such, in one sense, it is said to be in the Msb, as
will be shown in what follows,]) said of an affair,
or event, (Msb,) or of a thing, (S, * K,) It appeared before one: (K:) [and] i. q. عَرَضَ (S,
Mgh) and (S, K) اِعْتَرَضَ (S, Msb, K) [i. e. it appeared; it showed, presented, or offered, itself: it occurred: and it presented itself, or intervened between
a person and an object before him, as an obstacle:
it opposed itself]: and so ↓ اِعْتَنَّ. (S, K.) [See
also عَنَنٌ, below.] Imra-el-Keys says,
فَعَنَّ لَنَا سِرْبٌ كَأَنَّ نِعَاجَهُ
عَذَارَى دَوَارٍ فِى مُلَآءٍ مُذَيَّلِ
(Mgh, TA, *) meaning, عَرَضَ, (TA,) i. e. And
there appeared to us a herd of wild oxen, as
though the females thereof were virgins making the
circuit of Dawár, or Duwár, in long-skirted garments of the kind called مُلَآء; Dawár, or Duwár,
being the name of an idol around which the
people of the Time of Ignorance used to curcuit.
(Mgh, * and EM pp. 46 and 47.) And one says,
لَا أَفْعَلُهُ مَا عَنَّ فِى السَّمَآءِ نَجْمٌ, meaning مَا عَرَضَ
[i. e. I will not do it as long as a star appears in
the sky]. (S.) ―
-b2-  And عَنَّ, (Msb, TA,) aor.
عَنِ3َ,
(Msb,) inf. n. عَنَنٌ, (TA,) or this is a simple
subst., (Msb, TA,) and the inf. n. is عَنٌّ, (TA,)
He opposed himself (اِعْتَرَضَ, Msb, or تَعَرَّضَ, TA)
to another (Msb) from right and left, (TA,) or
from either side of him, (Msb,) with an abominable, or evil, action. (Msb, TA.) ―
-b3-  And عَنَّ
عَنِ الشَّىْءِ, aor.
عَنِ3َ, [inf. n., app., عَنٌّ,] He turned
aside, or away, from the thing. (Msb.) ―
-b4-  Hence
the saying of the lawyers, عَنَّ عَنِ امْرَأَةٍ دُونَ أُخْرَى
[He turned away from one woman, not from
another]; meaning he desired not one woman, but
desired another: thus in the active form: and
one may also say عُنَّ i. e. in the passive form
[from one or another of the following significations of the trans. verb]. (Msb.) For the latter
of these, and its var. عُنِنَ, see 2.
-A2-  عَنَنْتُ اللِّجَامَ:
see 4. ―
-b2-  عَنَّ دَابَّتَهُ He put a rein (عِنَان) to his
beast. (TA.) And عَنَنْتُ الفَرَسَ, (S, Msb, K,)
aor.
عَنُ3َ; (Msb;) in the M [↓ عَنَّنْتُ,] with tesh-deed; (TA;) I withheld the horse by means of
his عِنَان [or rein]; (S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ أَعْنَنْتُهُ:
(K:) or الفَرَسَ ↓ أَعْنَنْتُ signifies I put a rein to
the horse: (Msb:) and it is said in the T that
الفَارِسُ ↓ أَعَنَّ means the horseman drew, or pulled,
the rein of his beast, to turn him back, or away,
from his course. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And عَنَنْتُهُ, (Msb,)
and عُنَّ, (Mgh,) I confined him, (Msb,) and he
was confined, (Mgh,) in the عُنَّة i. e. the enclosure
(Mgh, Msb) of the camels. (Mgh.)
-A3-  عَنَنْتُ فُلَانًا
I reviled such a one; vilified him; or gave a bad
name to him. (K.)

عَنَّنْتُ اللِّجَامَ: see 4. ―
-b2-  عَنَّنْت الفَرَسَ: see 1,
last quarter. ―
-b3-  [Hence, perhaps,] عُنِّنَ عَنِ امْرَأَتِهِ,
(S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَعْنِينٌ, (Msb,) which see
also voce عُنَّةٌ, former half, in two places, He was
pronounced by the judge (S, Msb, K) to be incapacitated from going in to his wife, (Msb, K,)
or to have no desire for his wife: or to be withheld
from her by enchantment, or fascination: (S,
Msb, K:) and ↓ أُعِنَّ signifies the same; as also
↓ عُنَّ, (K, TA,) and ↓ عُنِنَ; and ↓ اعْتُنَّ. (TA.
[Thus in the supplement to this art. in the TA;
but it seems that the last of these verbs may be a
mistranscription for أُعِنَّ, as this verb is there
omitted, though the other verbs are mentioned,
and followed by the part. ns. مَعْنُونٌ and مُعَنٌّ
and مُعَنَّنٌ, but not مُعْتَنٌّ.]) ―
-b4-  التَّعْنيِنُ also signifies The confining in a deep مَطْبَق [or subterranean prison]. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And عَنَّنَتْ شَعَرَهَا, said
of a woman, means شَكَلَتْ بَعْضَهُ بِبَعْضٍ [i. e. She
plaited together two locks of her hair, of the fore
part of her head, on the right and left, and then
bound them with her other pendent locks or plaits].
(TA.)
-A2-  See also Q. Q. 1.

المُعَانَّةُ and
العِنَانُ signify المُعَارَضَةُ, (S, Msb,
K, TA,) as inf. ns. of عَانَّهُ [meaning He did like
as he (the latter) did: or he opposed him, being
opposed by him]. (TA.) See, below, شِرْكَةُ
العِنَانِ: and also عُنَانَاكَ.
4
أَعَنَّ [i. q. تَعَرَّضَ]. One says, ↓ أَعْنَنْتُ بِعُنَّةٍ
مَا أَدْرِى مَا هِىَ, (S, K, but in the latter لا ادرى,)
meaning I addressed, applied, or directed, myself
to a thing (تَعَرَّضْتُ لِشَىْءٍ) not knowing what it
was. (S, K.)
-A2-  And أَعْنَنْتُهُ لِكَذَا I exposed him,
or caused him to become exposed, (عَرَّضْتُهُ,) to such
a thing; and I turned him to it, or towards it.
(S.)
-A3-  أَعْننْتُ اللِّجَامَ I put a rein (عِنَان) to the
bit; (S, K;) as also ↓ عَنَّنْتُهُ, (S, * K,) inf. n.

عِنْدَهُمْ He became acquainted with their state, or
case. (K.)
-A3-  اعْتُنَّ: see 2.
R. Q. 1
عَنْعَنَةٌ [an inf. n. of which the verb is
عَنْعَنَ] The substituting of ع for ء; [for instance,]
saying عَنْ in the place of أَنْ: a practice of [the
tribe of] Temeem: (S, K:) or, accord. to Fr, it
is of the dial. of Kureysh and of those in their
neighbourhood, and of Temeem and Keys and
Asad and those in their neighbourhood: they
change the أ of أَنَّ, with fet-h, into ع; but not
when it is with kesr. (TA.) [See two instances
in art. عنف, conj. 8.] ―
-b2-  Hence, عَنْعَنَةُ المُحَدِّثِينَ
[i. e. The saying of the relaters of traditions فُلَانٌ
عَنْ فُلَانٍ عَنْ فُلَانٍ, suppressing the word رَوَى or
حَدَّثَ or. سَمِعَ]: but this is said to be post-classical. (TA.)
Q. Q. 1
عَنْوَنَ الكِتَابَ He put a superscription,
or title, (عُنْوَان,) to the book, or writing; (S, *
Msb;) or he wrote the عُنْوَان of the book, or
writing; (K;) like عَلْوَنَهُ; (TA;) and ↓ عَنَّهُ,
(S, K, TA,) aor.
عَنُ3َ, inf. n. عَنٌّ, (TA,) signifies
the same; as also ↓ عنّنهُ, (S, K, TA,) inf. n.
تَعْنِينٌ, mentioned by Lh; (TA;) and عَنَّاهُ, (S,
K, TA,) formed by changing one of the ن s [of
عَنَّنَ] into ى. (S, TA.) [See also Q. Q. 1 in
art. عنو.]
عَنْ is used in three manners:
-A2-  First, it is a
prep.: and as such it has ten meanings. (Mughnee, K.) ―
-b2-  (1) It denotes transition; (Msb,
Mughnee, K;) either sensibly or virtually;
(Msb;) and the Basrees have mentioned no
other meaning than this: (Mughnee:) or, as Sb
expresses it, (Msb,) it denotes what has passed
[or rather it denotes passage] from the thing
[that is mentioned immediately after it]: (S,
Msb:) Er-Rághib says that it necessarily denotes transition from that to the mention of
which it is prefixed: and the grammarians say
that it is applied to denote what has passed and
become remote from thee. (TA.) Thus in the
saying, سَافَرْتُ عَنِ البَلَدِ [I journeyed from the
country, or town]. (Mughnee, K. *) And in رَغِبْتُ
عَنْ كَذَا [I abstained from such a thing; and
hence, I did not desire, or wish for, such a thing].
(Mughnee.) And رَمَيْتُ عَنِ القَوْسِ [I shot an
arrow, or arrows, from the bow]; (S, Mughnee;) because by means of the bow one projects
his arrow from the bow, and makes it to pass
therefrom: (S:) but another meaning of this will
be mentioned in what follows. (Mughnee.) And
أَطْعَمْتُهُ عَنْ جُوعٍ [I fed him so as to free him
from hunger]; (S, Msb;) making hunger to be
quitted, and passed from: (S, * Msb:) and in this
case, مِنْ is used in its place, (S, TA,) as in the
Kur cvi. 3; (TA;) or the meaning in this instance is, because of hunger. (Jel.) And جَلَسْتُ
عَنْ يَمِينِهِ, [as though] meaning I sat passing
away from the place of his right side, in sitting,
to another place [adjacent thereto: but see another explanation near the end of the paragraph].
(Msb.) And اِنْصَرِفْ عَنِّى and تَنَحَّ عَنِّى [Turn
thou, or go thou, away, or aside, from me].
(TA.) And أَخَذْتُ العِلْمَ عَنْهُ I understood, or became acquainted with, [or acquired,] knowledge,
or science, from him; as though the understanding passed from him. (Msb.) [And similar to
this is the phrase رَوَى عَنْ فُلَانٍ, for which عَنْ
فُلَانٍ alone (the verb being understood) is often
used, He related a tradition or traditions &c. as
learned, or heard, or received, from such a one,
or on the authority of such a one. In many other
phrases also, some of which will be mentioned in
treating of عَنْ as syn. with مِنْ, the former of
these two prepositions is to be, or may be, expl.
as denoting transition. For ex., one says, دَفَعَ
عَنْهُ and دَافَعَ He repelled from him; and hence,
he defended him: (see art. دفع:) and رَمَى عَنْهُمْ
He shot in defence of them: (see an ex. in a verse
cited voce مَعْبُولٌ:) and عَنْهُ is sometimes used
for دِفَاعًا عَنْهُ; as in the phrase قَاتَلْتُ عَنْهُ I fought
in defence of him; i. e., repelling from him. But
the instances of this and other usages of عَنْ, exclusive of those mentioned in this paragraph, depending upon verbs or part. ns. expressed or obviously understood, are far too numerous to be
here collected: many of these will be found
among the explanations of words with which they
occur.] ―
-b3-  (2) It denotes a compensation; or
something given, or received, or put, or done,
instead, or in lieu, of another thing. (Mughnee,
K.) Thus in the saying [in the Kur ii. 45],
وَ اتَّقُوا يَوْمًا لَا تَجْزِى نَفْسٌ عَنْ نَفْسٍ شَيْئًا [And fear
ye a day wherein a soul shall not give anything
as a satisfaction for a soul, i. e. for another soul:
or shall not make satisfaction for a soul at all;
accord. to the latter rendering, شيئا being put in
the accus. case after the manner of an inf. n.].
(Mughnee, K. *) And in the saying in a trad.,
صُومِى عَنْ أُمِّكِ [Fast thou for, or in lieu of, thy
mother]. (Mughnee.) ―
-b4-  (3) It denotes superiority
(الاِسْتِعْلَآء [as used tropically]); (Mughnee, K;)
i. e. as syn. with عَلَى. (Mughnee.) Thus in the
saying of Dhu-l-Isba' El-'Adwánee,
لَاهِ ابْنُ عَمِّكَ لَا أَفْضَلْتَ فِى حَسَبٍ
عَنِّى وَلَا أَنْتَ دَيَّانِى فَتَخْزُوَنِى
(S, Mughnee,) i. e. To God be attributed the excellence of the son of thy paternal uncle (the
meaning being لِلّٰهِ دَرُّ ابْنِ عَمِّكَ), thou hast not become possessed of superiority, in grounds of pretension to respect or honour, above me, or over me,
(عَلَىَّ,) nor art thou my governor that thou
shouldst rule me; for the well-known mode is to
say أَفْضَلْتُ عَلَيْهِ. (Mughnee.) [Thus too in the
phrases تَعَظَّمَ عَنْهُ and تَعَاظَمَ عَنْهُ (expl. in art.
عظم), and in the phrase تَجَالَّ عَنْهُ (expl. in art.
جل), and the like.] And thus it has been said
to be used in the phrase [in the Kur xxxviii. 31],
إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَنْ ذِكْرِ رَبِّى, meaning
قَدَّمْتُهُ عَلَيْهِ [i. e. Verily I have preferred the love
of good things above, or to, the remembrance, or
praise, of my Lord]: but it is also said that it is
here used in its proper manner, as dependent
upon a denotative of state suppressed; the meaning being, مُنْصَرِفًا عَنْ ذِكْرِ رَبِّى [i. e. turning
away from the remembrance, &c.]: and AO is
related to have said that أَحْبَبْتُ is from أَحَبَّ,
البَعِيرُ, signifying “ the camel lay down and did
not become roused; ” and that the meaning is,
I have become withheld by the love of good things
from the remembrance, &c. (Mughnee.) And
it is [said to be] used as denoting superiority or
the like in the saying [in the Kur xlvii. last verse],
فَإِنَّمَا يَبْخَلُ عَنْ نفْسِهِ [as though the meaning
were He is niggardly only to himself (عَلَى نَفْسِهِ,
for عَلَى is considered in this case as importing an
ideal superiority); but the phrase may be better
rendered, agreeably with the proper, or primary,
signification of عَنْ, he withholds, with niggardliness, only from himself; as is indicated by Bd].
(Mughnee, K.) ―
-b5-  (4) It denotes a cause. (Mughnee, K.) Thus in the saying [in the Kur ix. 115],
وَمَا كَانَ اسْتِغْفَارُ إِبْرٰهِيمَ لِأَبِيهِ إِلَّا عَنْ مَوْعِدَةٍ [And
Abraham's begging forgiveness for his father was
not otherwise than because of a promise]. (Mughnee, K.) And thus in the saying [in the Kur
xi. 56], وَمَا نَحْنُ بِتَارِكِى آلِهَتِنَا عَنْ قَوْلِكَ [And we
are not, or will not be, relinquishers of our gods
because of thy saying]: or the meaning may be,
we do not, or will not, relinquish our gods, turning
away (صَادِرِينَ, as a denotative of state relating
to the pronoun [implied] in تاركى,) from thy
saying; and this is the opinion of Z. (Mughnee.)
[See also an ex. voce دَنْدَنَ, last sentence.] ―
-b6-
(5) It is syn. with بَعْدَ. (S, Mughnee, K.) Thus
in the saying [in the Kur xxiii. 42], عَمَّا قَلِيلٍ
لَيُصْبِحُنَّ نَادِمِينَ, (Mughnee, K,) meaning بَعْدَ
قَلِيلٍ [i. e. After a little while, they will assuredly
become repentant]. (TA.) And in the phrase
[in the Kur lxxxiv. 19], لَتَرْكَبُنَّ طَبَقًا عَنْ طَبَقٍ
[expl. in art. طبق], meaning حَالَةً بَعْدَ حَالَةٍ.
(Mughnee.) And in the saying,
وَمَنْهَلٍ وَرَدْتُهُ عَنْ مَنْهَلٍ
[And to many a watering-place have I come
after a watering-place]. (Mughnee.) And in the
saying of El-Hárith Ibn-'Obád,
قَرِّبَا مَرْبَطَ النَّعَامَةِ مِنِّى
لَقِحَتْ حَرْبُ وائِلٍ عَنْ حِيَالِ
(S, * TA,) meaning بَعْدَ حِيَالٍ [i. e. Make ye two
to be near to me the place of the tying of En-Na'ámeh (the name of a horse of the poet): the
war of Wáïl has become pregnant after failing to
be pregnant during a year, or years]. (TA.)
And in the saying of Et-Tirimmáh,
سَيَعْلَمُ كُلُّهُمْ أَنِّى مُسِنٌّ
↓ إِذَا دَفَعُوا عِنَانًا عَنْ عِنَانِ
i. e. [All of them shall know that I am of full
age, when they press forward] heat after heat.
(TA.) ―
-b7-  (6) It denotes the meaning of the preposition فِى. (Mughnee, K.) Thus in the saying,
وَلَا تَكُ عَنْ حَمْلِ الرِّبَاعَةِ وَانِيَا
[And be not thou remiss in bearing the responsibility of the obligation that thou takest upon thyself]; as is shown by the phrase, [in the Kur
xx. 44], وَلَا تَنِيَا فِى ذِكْرِى: (Mughnee, K:) so
it is said; but it seems that the meaning of وَنَى
عَنْ كَذَا is, “he passed from such a thing, not entering upon it; ” and وَنَى فِيهِ, “he entered upon it
but was remiss, or languid: ” by الرِّبَاعَة is meant
the payment of a bloodwit or the like. (Mughnee.) ―
-b8-  (7) It is syn. with مِنْ. (Mughnee, K.)
Thus in the saying [in the Kur xlii. 24], وَهُوَ
الَّذِى يَقْبَلُ التَّوْبَةَ عَنْ عِبَادِهِ [And He is he who
accepts repentance from his servants]. (AO, Mughnee, K.) Az mentions among the cases in which
there is a difference between مِنْ and عَنْ, that
the former has adjoined to it a noun signifying
what is near; and the latter, [one signifying]
what is remote; as in one's saying سَمِعْتُ مِنْ
فُلَانٍ حَدِيثًا [I heard from such a one a narrative], and حَدَّثَنِى عَنْ فُلَانٍ حَدِيثًا [He related to
me a narrative from such a one, a phrase similar
to رَوَى عَنْ فُلَانٍ, mentioned among exs. of the
first meaning of عن]: accord. to As, one says,
حَدَّثَنِى فُلَانٌ مِنْ فُلَانٍ, meaning عَنْهُ [i. e. Such a
one related to me from such a one]; and لَهِيتُ مِنْ
فُلَانٍ and عَنْهُ [I became diverted from such a one
so as to forget him]: accord. to Ks, one says
لَهِيتُ عَنْهُ only: and عَنْكَ جَآءَ هٰذَا as meaning مِنْكَ
[i. e. From thee came this]. (TA.) ―
-b9-  (8) It is
syn. with بِ. (Mughnee, K.) Thus [it is said
to be used] in the phrase [in the Kur liii. 3],
وَمَا يَنْطِقُ عَنِ الْهَوَى [Nor does he speak with the
desire of self-gratification]: (Mughnee, K:) but
it seems that it is here used in its proper [or primary] sense; and that the meaning is, وَمَا يَصْدُرُ
قَوْلُهُ عَنْ هَوًى [nor does his speech proceed from desire of self-gratification; so the phrase may be well
rendered, nor does he speak from the desire &c.].
(Mughnee.) One says also, أَجَابُوا عَنْ بَوَآءٍ وَاحِدٍ,
meaning بِجَوَابٍ وَاحِدٍ [i. e. They replied with one
reply]. (T, S, O, K, all in art, بوأ.) And جَاؤُوا
عَنْ آخِرِهِمْ [They came with the last of them;
عَنْ being here syn. with بِ; meaning they came
all, without exception]. (A in art. اخر.) [And
in like manner, قَتَلُوهُمْ عَنْ آخِرِهِمْ They slew them
with the last of them; meaning they slew them
all, without exception.] ―
-b10-  (9) It denotes the using
a thing as an aid or instrument. (Mughnee, K.)
Thus in the saying, رَمَيْتُ عَنِ القَوْسِ [I shot with,
or by means of, the bow], accord. to Ibn-Málik;
(Mughnee, K;) because one says also, رَمَيْتُ
بِالقَوْسِ; both mentioned by Fr. (Mughnee.)
[Another explanation of this phrase has been
mentioned before.] ―
-b11-  (10) It is redundant, to
compensate for another [عن] suppressed (Mughnee, K.) Thus in the saying,
أَتَجْزَعُ إِنْ نَفْسٌ أَتَاهَا حِمَامُهَا
فَهَلَّا الَّتِى عَنْ بَيْنِ جَنْبَيْكَ تَدْفَعُ
[Art thou impatient if the decreed event of death
befall a soul? but why wilt not thou repel from,
i. e. defend, that which is between thy two sides?];
(Mughnee, K;) the meaning being, تَدْفَعُ عَنِ
الَّتِى بَيْنَ جَنْبَيْكَ; (IJ, Mughnee;) عن being
suppressed before the conjunct noun [التى], and
added after it. (Mughnee, K.) And sometimes
it is redundant without compensation, when conjoined with a pronoun: AZ says that the Arabs
make عَنْكَ redundant in the phrase خُذْ ذَا عَنْكَ
[meaning Take thou, or receive thou, this]: (TA:)
[but خُذْ عَنْكَ is expl. in the S and L, in art. اخذ,
as meaning خُذْ مَا أَقُولُ وَدَعْ عَنْكَ الشَّكَّ وَالمِرَآءَ: see
1 in art. اخذ:] and اُنْفُذْ عَنْكَ, occurring in a trad.,
is expl. as meaning دَعْهُ [i. e. Leave thou it]:
(TA:) or this means go thou from thy place;
pass thou from it. (L in art. نفذ.) [See also the
last ex. in this paragraph.]
-A3-  The second manner of using it is, as a particle of the kind called
مَصْدَرِىٌّ, [combining with an aor. following it to
form an equivalent to an inf. n.,] as is done by
the tribe of Temeem, (Mughnee, K, *) in what is
termed their عَنْعَنَة: (K: [see R. Q. 1:]) they
use it in the place of أَنْ; (S, Mughnee;) saying,
أَعْجَبَنِى عَنْ تَفْعَلَ, (Mughnee, K,) for أَنْ تَفْعَلَ
[meaning Thy doing such a thing pleased me].
(Mughnee.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says,
أَعَنْ تَرَسَّمْتَ مِنْ خَرْقَآءَ مَنْزِلَةً
مَآءُ الصَّبَابَةِ مِنْ عَيْنَيْكَ مَسْجُومُ
[Is thy having looked upon the traces of a place of
abiding of thy beloved Kharkà the cause that the
water of excessive love is shed from thine eyes?].
(S, Mughnee.) And thus they do in the case of
أَنَّ; saying, مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللّٰهِ ↓ أَشْهَدُ عَنَّ [I acknowledge, or declare, or testify, that Mohammad
is the apostle of God]. (Mughnee.)
-A4-  The third
manner of using it is, as a noun, in the sense of
جَانِب, (Mughnee, K, *) or نَاحِيَة: (S:) and this
is said to be in three cases. (Mughnee.) ―
-b2-  (1)
It is when مِنْ is prefixed to it; and this is of
frequent occurrence: (Mughnee:) as in the saying,
وَلَقَدْ أَرَانِى لِلرِّمَاحَ دَرِيْئَةً
مِنْ عَنْ يَمِينِى مَرَّةً وَأَمَامِى
[And verily I see me to be like a ring for the
spears to be aimed at, from the side of my right
hand at one time, and from before me at another
time]: (Mughnee, K: *) and in the saying, جِئْتُ
مِنْ عَنْ يَمِينِهِ I came from the side of his right
hand. (S.) In the opinion of Ibn-Málik, مِنْ
prefixed to عَنْ is redundant; but accord. to
others, it is used [as expl. above,] to denote the
beginning of a space between two limits: these
say that قَعَدْتُ عَنْ يَمِينِهِ means فِى جَانِبِ يَمِينِهِ
[i. e. I sat in the side of his right hand], either
closely or otherwise; but if you say مِنْ [before
عَنْ], the sitting is particularized as being close to
the first part of the lateral space. (Mughnee.)
―
-b3-  (2) It is also when عَلَى is prefixed to it:
(Mughnee:) thus in the saying,
عَلَى عَنْ يَمِينِى مَرَّتِ الطَّيْرُ سُنَّحَا
[On, or over, the side of my right hand, the birds
passed along turning the right side towards me, or
turning the left side towards me; the last word
being a pl., accord. to analogy, of سَانِحٌ, which
is used in two opposite senses]: (Mughnee, K:)
but this usage is extraordinary; no other instance
of it than that here cited having been preserved.
(Mughnee.) ―
-b4-  (3) It is also when what is
governed by it in the gen. case and the agent of
the verb in connection with it are two pronouns
having one application: so says Akh: as in the
saying of Imra-el-Keys,
دَعْ عَنْكَ نَهْبًا صِيحَ فِى حَجَرَاتِهِ
[or فَدَعْ عَنْكَ: see the entire verse cited and expl.
in art. حجر]: but it is shown to be not a noun
in such a case by this, that جَانِب may not take
its place [unless used in a tropical sense]. (Mughnee. [See what has been said above, that عَنْكَ in
a phrase of this kind is held to be redundant.])
عَنَّ for أَنَّ: see the next preceding paragraph,
last quarter.
عَنٌّ: see أَعْنَانٌ. ―
-b2-  إِنَّه يَأْخُذُ فِى كُلِّ عَنٍّ means
the same as فى كلّ فَنٍّ [i. e. Verily he enters
upon every mode, or manner, of speech or the
like]; and so فى كلّ سَنٍّ. (TA.)
عَنَّةٌ: see what next follows.
عُنَّةٌ The presenting, or opposing, oneself, with
meddling, or impertinent, speech; with speech respecting that which does not concern him; (Msb,
TA;) as also ↓ عَنَّةٌ, with fet-h, (Msb,) or ↓ عِنَّةٌ,
with kesr. (TA.) ―
-b2-  أَعْطَيْتُهُ عَيْنَ عُنَّةٍ, (S,) or
عَيْنَ عُنَّةَ, imperfectly decl., and sometimes عَيْنَ
عُنَّةٍ, (K,) means I gave to him distinguishing him
particularly from among his companions: (S, K:)
from العَنُّ signifying “ the presenting, or opposing,
oneself. ” (TA.) And one says, رَأَيْتُهُ عَيْنَ عُنَّةٍ
(S) or عُنَّةَ (K) I saw him just now, (S, K, TA,)
presenting, or opposing, himself, (TA,) without
my seeking him. (S, TA.) And أَعْنَنْتُ بِعُنَّةٍ مَا
أَدْرِى مَا هِىَ: see 4. (S, K.)
-A2-  It is also the
subst. from عُنِّنَ عَنِ امْرَأَتِهِ [i. e. a subst. signifying The state of being pronounced by the judge to
be incapacitated from going in to his wife, or to
have no desire for his wife: or of being withheld
from her by enchantment, or fascination]: (S,
Msb, * K:) or incapacity to go in to women:
(Mgh, Msb:) or undesirousness of women: (Msb:)
a word used in this sense by the lawyers; (Mgh,
Msb;) who say, بِهِ عُنَّةٌ: (Msb:) but it is declared to be a low word, not allowable; (Mgh,
Msb;) instead of which one should say ↓ تَعْنِينٌ,
(Mgh,) or, accord. to Th and others, ↓ عَنَنٌ, and
↓ عِنِّينَةٌ, and accord. to the Bári', ↓ عَنَانَةٌ: (Msb:)
[i. e.] ↓ عِنِّينَةٌ signifies undesirousness of women:
(S:) or, as also ↓ عِنِينَةٌ, and ↓ عَنَانَةٌ, and ↓ تَعْنِينٌ,
and ↓ تَعْنِينَةٌ, (K,) and ↓ عِنِّينِيَّةٌ, (TA,) it signifies
thus, or non-performance of the act of going in to
women, by reason of impotence. (K, TA.)
-A3-
Also An enclosure (S, Mgh, Msb, K) made of
wood, (S, Msb, K, TA,) or of trees, (TA,) for
camels, (S, Mgh, K, *) or for camels and horses,
(Msb,) or for camels and sheep or goats, to be
confined therein: (TA:) or an enclosure at the
door of a man, in which are his camels and his
sheep or goats: (Th, TA:) pl. عُنَنٌ (S, K) and
عِنَانٌ. (K.) لَا يَجْتَمِعُ اثْنَانِ فِى عُنَّةٍ [Two (app.
meaning stallion-camels) will not be together in an
enclosure for camels] is one of their sayings. (TA.)
And one says, كالْمُهَدِّرِ فِى العُنَّةِ Like the brayer
(meaning the braying stallion-camel) in the enclosure of trees, in which the stallion-camel is sometimes confined to prevent him from covering;
such a stallion being hence termed ↓ معَنًّى, originally ↓ مُعَنَّنٌ: (Meyd:) it is a prov., applied to
a man (Meyd, TA, and S and A and K in
art. هدر) raising a cry and clamour, (S, K,) or
threatening, (TA,) who does not make his saying, or action, to have effect; (S, * Meyd, K;)
like the camel that is so confined, prevented from
covering, and brays. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  It is also said,
by El-Bushtee and in the K, to signify A rope;
and in a verse of El-Aashà, in which he mentions
flesh-meat as put upon the عُنَن, this last word
has been expl. as meaning ropes which are
stretched, and upon which is thrown the flesh-meat that is cut into strips, or oblong pieces, and
dried in the sun: but Az says that the right
meaning is, the enclosures for camels; that he
had seen such enclosures in the desert, thus called
because facing the direction whence blows the
north wind, to protect the camels from the cold
of that wind; and that he had seen the people
spread the flesh-meat cut into strips, or oblong
pieces, and dried in the sun, upon them: he
thinks that the word was expl. as meaning ropes
by one who had seen the poor of the sacred territory extending ropes in Minè, and putting upon
them the flesh of the victims of sacrifice that had
been given to them. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also A booth by
means of which one shades himself, made of panic
grass (ثُمَام) or [probably a mistake for and]
branches of trees. (IB, TA.) ―
-b4-  And Reeds, or
plants or herbage, which a man collects, to give,
as fodder, to his sheep or goats: one says, جَآءَ بِعُنَّةٍ
عَظِيمَةٍ [He came with, or brought, a great collection of reeds, &c.]. (TA.) And one says, كُنَّا
فِى عُنَّةٍ مِنَ الكَلَأِ, and غُنَّةٍ, and ثُنَّةِ, i. e. We were
in abundant herbage. (TA.)
-A4-  Also The دِقْدَان
(thus [correctly, as will be shown by an explanation in what follows, confirmed by an ex. from a
poet,] in more than one of the copies of the K, in
the CK دَقْدان, in the copy of the K followed in
the TA وقدان, and in the L رقدان,) of the cooking-pot: (K, TA:) MF read وقدان, and conjecturally, and from analogy, supposed it [to be
وَقَدَان and] to mean غَلَيَان; but the word is
arabicized from the Pers. ديكدان, [correctly
ديگدان, pronounced dēgdān,] a name for the
thing upon which the cooking-pot is set up; and
thus it [i. e. عُنَّةٌ] is expl. in the M and other
lexicons [among which may be mentioned the
L]: hence the saying of a poet,
عَفَتْ غَيْرَ أَنْآءٍ وَمَنْصَبِ عُنَّةٍ
وَأوْرَقَ مِنْ تَحْتِ الخَصَاصَةِ هَامِدِ
[It (the دار, or place of abode,) was effaced, save
trenches dug around the tents to keep off the torrent, and the place of the setting-up of the support
of the cooking-pot, and ashes beneath the space
between the three stones that formed that support,
in a state of extinction]. (TA.)
عِنَّةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, first
sentence.
عَنَنٌ is a subst. [as well as an inf. n.] of عَنَّ;
(Msb, K, TA;) [as such,] i. q. اِعْتِرَاضٌ [used as
a simple subst., meaning Opposition]; (K, * TA;)
as also ↓ عِنَانٌ: (K, TA:) or opposition of oneself
to another, from either side of him, with an
abominable, or evil, action. (Msb.) El-Hárith
Ibn-Hillizeh says,
عَنَنًا بَاطِلًا وَظُلْمًا كَمَا يُعْ
تَرُ عَنْ حُجْرَةِ الرَّبِيضِ الظِّبَآءُ
(TA,) meaning In wrong opposition, (اِعْتِرَاضًا
بَاطِلًا), [and injurious conduct], like as when
gazelles are sacrificed [in fulfilment of a vow] for
what is due on the part of the flock of sheep, or
herd of goats. (EM p. 281.) And it is said in
a trad., بَرِئْنَا إِلَيْكَ مِنَ الوَثَنِ والعَنَنِ i. e. [We are
clear, to thee,] of the idol (الصَّنَم) and opposition
(الاِعْتِرَاض); as though saying, of associating
another with God and of wrongdoing: or, as
some say, the meaning [of the last word] in this
case is disagreement, or opposition, or contravention, (الخِلَاف), and that which is wrong (البَاطِل).
(TA.) And in another trad., دَهِمَتْهُ المَنِيَّةُ فِى عَنَنِ
جِمَاحِهِ [Death came upon him suddenly in the
opposition of his heedless, or inconsiderate, course].
(TA. [There expl. only by the words هُوَ مَا لَيْسَ
بِقَصْدٍ.]) And one says, هُوَ لَكَ بَيْنَ الأَوْبِ وَالعَنَنِ,
meaning [He is to thee in a state] between obedience and disobedience. (TA.) ↓ وَرْهَآءُ العِنَانِ, a
phrase used by a poet, means [A woman foolish
in] opposing herself, or intervening, in every discourse. (TA.) And العَنَنُ signifies also [particularly] Death's opposing itself, and preceding:
(TA, JM:) occurring in a trad. of Sateeh [the
Diviner]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also عِنَانٌ, near the
middle of the paragraph. ―
-b3-  Also The place in
which a person, or thing, presents, or opposes,
himself, or itself. (TA.) ―
-b4-  See also أَعْنَانٌ.
-A2-
And see عُنَّةٌ, former half.
عَنَانٌ Clouds: (S, Msb, K:) or, accord. to
some, clouds appearing, or presenting themselves,
or extending sideways, in the horizon; as also
↓ سَحَابٌ عَانٌّ: (TA:) such as retain the water:
(K:) one whereof is termed ↓ عَنَانَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,)
and ↓ عَانَّةٌ. (S.) ―
-b2-  And عَنَانُ السَّمَآءِ, (Mgh, MF,
TA,) in the K said to be ↓ عِنَان, with kesr, but
the former is the right, (MF, TA,) The lofty
region of the sky: (Mgh:) or what appears, of
the sky, to one looking at it. (K. [See also
أَعْنَانٌ.]) ―
-b3-  And عَنَانُ الدَّارِ, likewise with fet-h,
accord. to the K ↓ عِنَان, with kesr, which is
wrong, (TA,) The side of the house, (K, TA,)
that appears to one. (TA.)
عِنَانٌ: see عَنَنٌ, in two places. ―
-b2-  Also an
inf. n. of 3 [q. v.]. (TA.)
-A2-  And A certain
appertenance of a horse or the like; (S, Msb;)
[i. e. the rein;] the strap of the bridle, by means
of which the horse, or similar beast, is withheld:
(K:) [said to be] so called because it lies over
against the mouth, not entering into it, (Msb,) or
because its two straps lie over against the two
sides of the neck of the beast, on the right and
left: (TA:) pl. أَعِنَّةٌ (S, Msb, K) and عُنُنٌ, (K,)
or, accord. to Sb, the former only. (TA.) [Sometimes it may be rendered The bridle; as in the
first of the following phrases.] ثَنَيْتُ عَلَى الفَرَسِ
عِنَانَهُ I put upon the horse his bridle. (TA.) فَرَسٌ
قَصِيرُ العِنَانِ [A horse short in the rein] implies
discommendation, as denoting shortness of the
neck: [but] هُوَ قَصِيرُ العِنَانِ [said of a man]
means قلِيلُ الخَيْرِ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He is one possessing
little, or no, good; or few, or no, good things;
or little, or no, goodness]: and إِنَّهُ لَطَوِيلُ العِنَانِ
[lit. Verily he is one whose rein is long] means,
(assumed tropical:)  an exalted person; of great chiefdom, or eminence. (TA.) رَجُلٌ طَرِفُ العِنَانِ (S, * K, TA, TK,
in one of my copies of the S طَرفُ, and in the other
طرَفُ, and in copies of the K طَرْقُ, [but correctly
طَرِف, q. v., like كَتِف, as is said in the TK,])
means (tropical:)  A man light, or active. (S, K, TA.) فُلَانٌ
أَبِىُّ العِنَانِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is one who refuses the rein.
(TA.) ذُو العِنَانِ applied to the horse means (assumed tropical:)  The
tractable, or submissive. (TA.) And ذَلَّ عِنَانُ
فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one became submissive. (TA.) ابْغ
مِنْ عِنَانِهِ [in which the first word is written in
my original thus, but it has been altered by the
copyist, and I doubt not that it is correctly أَرْخِ,
the phrase, reading thus, being well known, i. e.
Slacken thou his rein,] means (assumed tropical:)  ease thou him, or
relieve him. (TA.) اِثْنِ عَلَىَّ عِنَانَهُ means Turn
thou back [or bend thou] towards me his rein.
(TA.) جَآء ثَانِيًا فِى عِنَانِهِ [thus in my original,
but correctly مِنْ عنانه, as in the S in art. ثنى,
i. e. He came bending a part of his rein, turning
from his course,] means (assumed tropical:)  he [came having] accomplished the object of his want. (TA.) مَلَأَ عِنَانَ
دَابَّتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He made, or urged, his beast to run vehemently. (TA.) And [hence, app.,] اِمْتَلَأَ عِنَانُهُ
(assumed tropical:)  The utmost of his power, or ability, was accomplished. (TA.) هُمَا يَجْرِيَانِ فِى عِنَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  They two
are equal in excellence or otherwise. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Also (assumed tropical:)  A heat; or single run to a goal, or limit:
one says, جَرَى الفَرَسُ عِنَانًا (assumed tropical:)  The horse ran a
heat: and كَبَا فِى عِنَانِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He stumbled in his
heat. (TA.) See also an ex., in a verse of Et-
Tirimmáh, voce عَنْ, in the middle of the paragraph. And ↓ عَنَنٌ signifies the same, i. e. A heat
of a beast: and also the beginning of speech:
whence the prov.,
مُعْتَرِضٌ لِعَنَنٍ لَمْ يَعْنِهِ
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Addressing himself to that which is not
of his business (مَا لَيْسَ مِنْ شَأْنِهِ). (Meyd.) ―
-b3-
And A long rope or cord. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And العِنَانُ
signifies حَبْلُ المَتْنِ [The cord of the portion of
the back along which extends the spine; app.
meaning the spinal cord, also called medulla spinalis, considered as a single cord]: (K:) [but
this consists of two lateral cords, connected together: and therefore, app., it is said that] عِنَانَا
المَتْنِ signifies حَبْلَاهُ [the two cords of the مَتْن].
(S.)
-A3-  شِرْكَةُ العِنَانِ is The copartnership of two
persons in one particular thing, (S, Mgh, Msb,
K,) exclusive of the rest of the articles of property
of either: (S, Msb, * K:) as though a thing presented itself to them (عَنَّ لَهُمَا, S, Mgh, Msb) and
they bought it (S) and they then became copartners in it: (S, Mgh, Msb:) so says ISk: (Mgh:)
or it is from the عِنَان of the horse, because each
assigns to his companion the عنان of the free
management of part of the property: (Mgh,
Msb:) or because it is allowable for them to differ,
like as does the عنان in the hand of the rider
when pulled and when slackened: (Mgh:) or,
accord. to Az, it is the case in which each of the
two copartners produces deenárs or dirhems, which
they mix together, and each gives permission to
the other to traffic therewith: and the lawyers
differ not in respect of its being lawful; if they
gain upon the two sums, the gain being between
them; and if they lose, the loss being on the
head of each of them [equally]: the partnership
of two persons in everything that is in their possession is called شِرْكَةُ المُفَاوَضَةِ [q. v.]: (TA:)
or it is the case of one's competing with a man in
the making of a purchase, and saying to him,
“ Make me to be a partner with thee; ” this being
before he [the purchaser] becomes entitled to الغَلَق,
or الغِلْق, or العلق, or العَلَق: (K: [the last word
in this explanation, thus written in four different
ways in different copies of the K, following the
words قَبْلَ أَنْ يَسْتَوْجِبَ, I think to be most probably الغَلَقَ, and to mean irredeemability by the
seller, from غَلِقَ الرَّهْنُ:]) or it is the case of two
persons' being equal in partnership, (Z, Msb, K,
TA,) in respect of what they contribute of gold or
silver; and is from the عِنَان of the beast; (TA;)
because the عنان of the beast consists of two
equal single pieces: (Z, Msb, K, TA:) or it is
from العِنَان as syn. with ↓ المُعَانَّة, meaning
المُعَارَضَة; (Msb, TA;) because each of them does
like as does the other in respect of his property
[that he supplies] and in selling and buying.
(TA.) See an ex. in a verse cited in art. شرك,
conj. 3. ―
-b2-  See also عَنَانٌ, in two places.
عَنُونٌ and ↓ عَانٌّ One who presents, or opposes,
himself, with meddling, or impertinent, speech;
with speech respecting that which does not concern
him: pl. [of the former agreeably with analogy]
عُنُنٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And the former, A beast (دَابَّة)
that precedes in journeying, or progress; (S, K,
TA;) that vies with the [other] beasts in journeying, or progress, and precedes them; and applied
to a wild ass in this sense. (TA.)
عَنِينٌ One unable to retain the wind of his belly.
(K.) ―

half, in two places.
عِنِينَةٌ: see عُنَّةٌ, former half.
عُنَانَاكَ means The utmost of thy power, or
ability, or of thy case: (S, K:) so in the saying,
عُنَانَاكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا [The utmost of thy power,
&c., is, or will be, thy doing such a thing]: (S:)
as though from ↓ المُعَانَّةُ; (S, TA;) the case being
that thou desirest to do a thing, and an obstacle
intervenes in the way to it, preventing thee and
withholding thee from it: (TA:) but it is disputed whether it be correctly thus, or غُنَامَاكَ.
(IB, TA.)
هُوَ عَنَّانٌ عَلَى آنُفِ القَوْمِ He is wont to precede,
or outstrip, the people, or party. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
هُوَ عَنَّانٌ عَنِ الخَيْرِ He is [one who holds back
from doing good, or] slow, or tardy, to do
good. (K.)
العَنُّونُ, of the measure فَعُّول, is an intensive
epithet applied to the present world (الدُّنْيَا) [as
meaning The offerer of much opposition]; because
it opposes itself to mankind. (TA.)
عِنِّينٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, * K, TA,) of the measure
فِعِّيلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, (S,) and
↓ عَنِينٌ, [thus written in two places in the TA,
and written without teshdeed in my copy of the
Msb, but in the latter case app. from carelessness
of the copyist, for otherwise the well-known form
عِنِّينٌ is not there mentioned,] of which (i. e. of
عَنِينٌ) عُنُنٌ is pl., [which seems to show that
عَنِينٌ is not a mistranscription for عِنِّينٌ, for فُعُلٌ
is a measure of a pl. of many epithets of the
measure فَعِيلٌ, as جَدِيدٌ and نَذِيرٌ &c., but not, to
my knowledge, of any word of the measure فِعِّيلٌ,]
(TA,) A man incapable of going in to women;
(Mgh, Msb;) one who does not go in to women
by reason of impotence: (K:) or, as some say,
one who has connection with her who is not a
virgin, but not with the virgin: (TA:) or a man
who is not desirous of women: (S, K:) and
↓ مَعْنُونٌ and ↓ مُعَنٌّ (Msb, TA) and ↓ مُعَنَّنٌ (TA)
signify the same. (Msb, TA.) And عِنِّينَةٌ signifies A woman not desirous of men: (S, Msb, *
TA:) but there is disagreement in respect of the
application of the epithet to a woman. (TA.)
عِنِّينَةٌ, as a subst.: see عُنَّةٌ, former half, in two
places.
عُنْوَانٌ and عِنْوَانٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ عُنْيَانٌ and
عِنْيَانٌ, (S, K,) the first of which is the most chaste,
(S,) originally عُنَّانٌ, (K,) of a book, or writing,
(S, Msb,) The superscription, or title, thereof:
(TK:) what these words denote is thus called
because it occurs (يَعِنُّ, K, TA, i. e. يَعْرِضُ, TA) in
a bordering part thereof: (K, TA:) and they
also signify [sometimes, as indicating the nature
of the contents,] the preface of a book, or writing.
(TK.) And Anything that serves as an indication
of another thing is called its عُنْوَان. (Msb, K.)
One says, الظَّاهِرُ عُنْوَانُ البَاطِنِ, meaning The outward state of the man is the indication of the inward state. (TK.) And one says of a man who
speaks obliquely, not plainly, جَعَلَ كَذَا عُنْوَانًا
لِحَاجَتِهِ He made such a thing to be an indication
of his want. (TA.) [See also art. عنو.]

حَبْل [i. e. rope],) that presents itself in the direction in which one is going, and interrupts his way.
(TA.)
أَعْنَانٌ The sides, quarters, tracts, or regions, of
anything: (Yoo, TA:) this is the proper signification: (TA:) [hence,] أَعْنَانُ السَّمَآءِ [in one of
my copies of the S السَّحَابِ, but altered from السَّمَآءِ,]
means The sides, quarters, tracts, or regions, of
the sky: (K:) or the surfaces thereof, and what
present themselves to view of the sides, quarters,
tracts, or regions, thereof; as though pl. of ↓ عَنَنْ,
(S, TA,) or of ↓ عَنٌّ: (TA:) the vulgar say
عِنَانُ السَّمَآءِ. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  And [it is said that]
أَعْنَانُ الشَّيَاطِينِ means The natural dispositions
of the devils. (K.) It is said of camels, in a
trad., خُلِقَتْ مِنْ أَعْنَانِ الشَّيَاطِينِ [as though
meaning They are created of the natural dispositions of the devils]: and in another trad., أَعْنَانُ
الشَّيَاطِينِ occurs as said [app. by Mohammad] in
answer to a question respecting camels: [but]
accord. to IAth, the meaning seems to be, that,
by reason of their many evil affections, they are
as though they were from the tracts of the devil
in respect of their natural dispositions. (TA.)
تَعْنِينَةٌ: see عُنَّةٌ, former half.
