عتم1
عَتڤمَ The primary signification of the inf. n. عَتْمٌ
in the [genuine] language of the Arabs is that of
Tarrying [or delaying]: and of withholding, or
restricting, or limiting, oneself. (TA.) See 2,
in three places. [Hence,] one says, غَرَسْتُ الوَدِىَّ
فَمَا عَتَمَ مِنْهَا شَىْءٌ i. e. [I planted the shoots of
palm-trees,] and not any of them was slow or
tardy [in its growth]. (S.) And عَتَمَتْ حَاجَتُهُ
The object of his want was, or became, slow or
tardy [of accomplishment]; as also ↓ أَعْتَمَتْ.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  عَتَمَ اللَّيْلُ, (S, K,) aor.
عَتِمَ, (S, TA,)
inf. n. عَتْمٌ, (TA,) The night was, or became,
dark, in the period termed عَتَمَة: (S:) or a
portion of the night passed; as also ↓ اعتم: (K:)
the latter mentioned by IAar. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And
عَتَمَتِ الإِبِلُ, aor.
عَتِمَ and
عَتُمَ, The camels were milked
at nightfall [i. e. at the commencement of the عَتَمَة];
as also ↓ أَعْتَمَت and ↓ استعتمت. (K.) ―
-b4-  See
also 4.
2
تَعْتِيمٌ and ↓ عَتْمٌ signify The being slow, or
tardy. (S.) You say, عتّم قِرَاهُ and ↓ عَتَمَ His
entertainment for his guest, or guests, was, or
became, slow, or tardy; syn. أَبْطَأَ [not أَبْطَأَ بِهِ]:
(S, K:) and he delayed it: (TA: [but this,
though virtually a correct rendering, is app. not
so literally:]) and ↓ اعتم likewise has the former
meaning: (K:) or قِرَى الضَيْفِ ↓ اعتم signifies he
delayed the entertainment of the guest. (S.) And
مَا عَتَّمَ أَنْ فَعَلَ كَذَا He delayed not, or was not
slow, to do, or in doing, such a thing. (S, K. *)
And حَاجَتَهُ ↓ اعتم He delayed [the accomplishment of] the object of his want. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
عتّم عَنْهُ He refrained, forbore, abstained, or desisted, from it, (S, K,) namely, an affair, (S,)
after having made progress therein; as also ↓ اعتم;
and ↓ عَتَمَ, aor.
عَتِمَ, (K, TA,) inf. n. عَتْمٌ: (TA:)
or this last signifies he withheld himself from doing
it, meaning, a thing that he desired: (K:) and
↓ اعتم signifies he delayed to do it. (TA.) And
[hence] one says, ضَرَبَهُ فَمَا عَتَّمَ, (S,) and حَمَلَ
عَلَيْهِ فَمَ عَتَّمَ, (S, K,) i. e. [He beat him, and he
attacked him,] and did not withhold, or restrict,
or limit, himself, in beating him, [and in attacking him,] (S,) or and did not recede, or draw
back, or desist: (K, TA:) the vulgar say,
ضَرَبَهُ فَمَا عَتَّبَ. (S.) ―
-b3-  See also 4.

أَعْتَمَ see 2, in five places: and see also 1, in
three places. ―
-b2-  اعتم (S, Msb) from العَتَمَةُ (S)
is like أَصْبَحَ from الصُّبْحُ; (S, Msb; *) i. e. it
signifies He entered upon the period termed
عَتَمَة; (Msb;) as also ↓ عَتَمَ, inf. n. ↓ عَتْمٌ:
(TA:) or he journeyed in that period; (K, TA;)
and so ↓ عتّم: (S, K, TA:) or both signify he
became in the period: (TA:) or he brought [his
camels] to the watering-place and [in the CK
“ or ”] he brought [them] back therefrom in that
period; (K, TA;) and did any kind of work or
action [therein]. (TA.)

إِعْتَتَمَ [اِعْتَتَمَتِ الإِبِلُ, accord. to Golius, (whom
Freytag has followed in this instance,) signifies
the same as اِسْتَعْتَمَت, as on the authority of the
K, in which I do not find it. He probably found
the former verb thus written erroneously for أَعْتَمَت
in this sense, which he has not mentioned.]
10
استعتمهُ He deemed him, or reckoned him,
slow, or tardy. (Z, TA.) ―
-b2-  اِسْتَعْتِمُوا نَعَمَكُمْ حَتَّى
تُفِيقَ means Delay ye the milking of your camels,
or cattle, until the milk shall have collected: (K,
TA:) for they used to bring back their camels a
little after sunset to their nightly resting-place,
and make them to lie down there a while, until,
when their milk had collected, after a portion of
the night had passed, they roused them and
milked them. (TA.)

عُتْمٌ and ↓ عُتُمٌ (S, K, but only the former in
some copies of the S,) The wild olive-tree: (S, K,
TA:) or such as does not bear anything: or such
as grows in the mountains: written by IAth ↓ عَتَمٌ,
and expl. by him as the olive-tree: or a species of
tree resembling it, growing in the Saráh (السَّرَاة).

عَتَمَةٌ Slowness, or tardiness: (IB, TA:) hence
the saying of a rájiz,
بِذِى سَلَمْ  طَيْفٌ أَلَمْ
بَيْنَ الخَيَمْ   ↓ يَسْرِى عَتَمْ
meaning يَسْرِى بَطِيْئًا, [i. e. A phantom visited
(أَلَمْ being for أَلَمَّ) in Dhoo-Selem, journeying by
night slowly amid the tents,] the ة of عَتَمَة [i. e.
عَتَمَةً] being elided. (TA. [But عَتَمٌ is also
mentioned in the TA, in the beginning of this
art., not as being originally عَتَمَةٌ, but simply as a
subst. in the sense expl. above.])
-A2-  [Also, in its
most usual sense,] The first third of the night,
after the disappearance of the شَفَق [or redness
that is seen in the sky after sunset]; (Kh, S, Msb,
K;) the first part of the night, after the setting
of the light of the شَفَق: (Msb:) or the time of
the prayer of nightfall: (S, K:) but the calling
of that prayer the prayer of the عَتَمَة, as the
Arabs of the desert called it, instead of calling it
the prayer of the عِشَآء, is said to be forbidden in
a trad. (TA.) ―
-b2-  عَتَمَةُ رُبَعٍ [The عتمة of a
young camel brought forth in the رَبِيع, which is
the beginning of the breeding-time], (S, K,) meaning the space during which it (i. e. the رُبَع) is
confined at its evening-feed, (K,) is applied to
the moonlight of the night when the moon is four
nights old. (S, K.) AZ says, The Arabs say
in relation to the moon when it is one night old,
عَتَمَةُ سُخَيْلَةٍ حَلَّ أَهْلُهَا بِرُمَيْلَةٍ [The عتمة of a little

suckings] of this ربع or of the فواق [or time
between two milkings] of its mother; or, as
IAar says, عَتَمَةُ أُمِّ الرُّبَعِ [The عتمة of the mother
of the ربع]: and when it is five nights old,

[app. A twisting and a grinding by a turning
towards the left and from the left; as though
meaning that it is a time fit for active employment]: and when it is seven nights old, دُلْجَةُ

of the dawn; as though its light were about to
overtake, and grapple with, that of daybreak].
(TA.) [It should be observed that every one of
these ten sayings is fancifully framed so as to
rhyme, perfectly or imperfectly, with words preceding it: the first being preceded by اِبْنُ لَيْلَةٍ;
the second, by اِبْنُ لَيْلَتَيْنِ; the third, by اِبْنُ
ثَلَاثٍ; the fourth, by اِبْنُ أَرْبَعٍ; and so on.] ―

حُلِبَتْ عَتَمَتُهَا The milk that was obtained from
