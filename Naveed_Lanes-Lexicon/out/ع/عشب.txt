عَشَبَ, inf. n.
عَشَبٌ; The place produced its [herbs, or herbage,
of the kind termed] عُشْب: (Msb:) and in like
manner, (Msb,) اعشبت الأَرْضُ, (S, O, Msb, K,)
and ↓ عَشِبَت, (Msb,) and thus in a copy of the
K, [and in my MS. copy,] but in another copy,
[and in the CK,] ↓ عشّبت, (TA,) The land produced عُشْب. (S, O, K.) [See also 12. After the
mention of بَلَدٌ عَاشِبٌ in the S and O, it is said
in the former that for the verb one does not say
otherwise than اعشبت الأَرْضُ, and in the latter
that one does not say عَشَبَ البَلَدُ.] ―

تعشّبت الإِبِلُ The camels fed upon [herbs, or
herbage, of the kind termed] عُشْب; and [accord.
to the TA as a distinct meaning] became fat (K,
TA) therefrom; (TA;) as also ↓ أَعْشَبَت accord.
to the K, but this latter is wrong, being correctly
↓ اعتشبت, as in the parent-lexicons. (TA.)

12
اِعْشَوْشَبَتِ الأَرْضُ The land produced abundance, or much, of [herbs, or herbage, of the kind

[season called] رَبِيع [i. e. رَبِيعُ الكَلَأَ, which begins
in January and ends in March, O. S.]: (Msb:) not
termed حَشِيشٌ until drying up: (S, O:) or, in the
opinion of the generality of the lexicologists,
عُشْبٌ is applied to such as is fresh and to such as
is dry: (ISd, TA voce حَشِيشٌ:) or the first, or
earliest, of herbage, (سَرَعَانُ الكَلَأِ,) in the رَبِيع, that
[afterwards] dries up, and does not remain; the
term كَلَأٌ being applied by the Arabs to عُشْب and
to other kinds: and عُشْبٌ is applied to fresh, green,
juicy, soft, or tender, herbs or leguminous plants, of
the desert, that come forth in the رَبِيع: and under
this term are included those that are hard and
thick, which are termed the ذُكُور thereof; as
well as to those that are slender and soft, which
are termed the أَحْرَار thereof: or, accord. to AHn,
whatever is destroyed by winter, and grows again
from the stocks, or roots, thereof, or the seed: he
says also that it is applied to such [herbage] as is
uninterrupted; as opposed to تَعَاشِيبُ: or, accord.
to Th, it is applied to the mature; as so opposed.
