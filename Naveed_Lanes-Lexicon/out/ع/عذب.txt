عذب1
عَذُبَ, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) aor.
عَذُبَ, (TA,)
inf. n. عُذُوبَةٌ, said of water, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,)
[and app. of wine or other beverage, and of food,
(see عَذْبٌ,)] It was, or became, sweet: (S, O, *
TA:) or it was, or became, easy and agreeable to
be drunk or swallowed. (Msb.) [See also 12. ―
-b2-
Freytag has also assigned to it a meaning belonging to أَعْذَبَ, q. v.]
-A2-  عَذَبَ: see 4, in two
places.
-A3-  And see also 2, last sentence.
-A4-
[عَذِبَ, inf. n. عَذَبٌ, is mentioned by Golius as
signifying “ Quisquiliis aut lente palustri obducta
fuit,” and in a similar manner by Freytag; by
both as said of water, and as on the authority of
the K: but I find, in the K, no ground for this,
except an explanation of عَذِبٌ, q.v., of which
ISd knew not a verb.]
2
عذّبهُ, inf. n. تَعْذِيبٌ, He punished, castigated, or chastised, him: (S, O, Msb, K:) [and
he, or it, tormented, or tortured, him:] originally,
he beat him: then, he punished him in any painful manner. (Msb.) It is said in a trad., إِنَّ
المَيِّتَ يُعَذَّبُ بِبُكَآءِ أَهْلِهِ عَلَيْهِ [Verily the dead will
be punished for his family's weeping for him]:
the reason of which is probably this; that the
Arabs used to charge their families to weep and
wail for them; therefore the dead is obnoxious to
punishment for his having done this. (IAth,
TA.) And the verb is used metaphorically in
relation to that which has not sensation: a poet
says,
لَيْسَتْ بِسَوْدَآءَ مِنْ مَيْثَآءَ مُظْلِمَةٍ
وَلَمْ تُعَذَّبْ بِإِدْنَآءٍ مِنَ النَّارِ
[It (app. wine) is not black, from Meytha, darkcoloured; nor has it been mulled (such seems to
be here the meaning of the verb) by being put
near to fire, or by being boiled]. (L, TA. [See
also مُعَذَّبَةٌ.]) ―
-b2-  See also 4, in two places.
-A2-
عذّب سَوْطَهُ, and هدّبهُ, [perhaps a mistranscription for ↓ عَذَبَهُ, for accord. to Golius, this last
and the first here mentioned are expl. by Z in the
sense here following,] He put an عِلَاقَة [i. e. an
عَذَبَة] to his whip: so in the A. (TA.)
4
اعذب القَوْمُ The people, or party, became in
the condition of having sweet water. (K, TA.
[Freytag has erroneously assigned this meaning to
عَذُبَ.])
-A2-  And اعذب, (O, TA,) inf.n. إِعْذَابٌ,
(K, TA,) He abstained, or desisted, (O, K, * TA,)
عَنْ شَىْءٍ from a thing; (TA;) and, (K, TA,) in
like manner followed by عَنْ, (TA,) he left,
quitted, or relinquished, (K, TA,) a thing: (TA:)
and ↓ استعذب, (K, TA,) likewise followed by
عَنْ, (TA,) signifies the same: (K, TA:) and
عَذْبٌ, (K, TA,) as inf. n. of ↓ عَذَبَ, (MF, TA,)
signifies the abstaining, &c., (K, MF, TA,) from
a thing: and [particularly] the abstaining (of a
man, and of an ass, and of a horse, TA) from
eating, by reason of intense thirst; (K, TA;)
being neither fasting nor breaking fast; (TA;)
and so عُذُوبٌ as inf. n. of the same verb. (MF,
TA.)
-A3-  And اعذبهُ, (S, O,) inf. n. إِعْذَابٌ;
(K;) and ↓ عذّبهُ, (O,) inf. n. تَعْذِيبٌ; (K;)
and ↓ عَذَبَهُ, (O,) inf. n. عَذْبٌ; (K;) He prevented, hindered, withheld, restrained, or forbade,
him, (S, O, K, *) عَنِ الأَمْرِ from [doing] the thing,
or affair. (S, O.) One says, أَعْذِبْ نَفْسَكَ عَنْ
كَذَا Withhold, or restrain, thyself from such a
thing. (S, O.)
-A4-  اعذبهُ [He deprived it of its
عَذَب; i. e.] he removed from it, (S, O, K,)
namely, water, (K,) or a watering-trough, or
tank, (S, O,) the floating particles that were upon
it, (S, O,) or its [green substance termed] طُحْلُب,
(K,) or both of these: (TA:) and ↓ تَعْذِيبٌ [in
like manner] signifies the removing of what is
termed عَذَب. (Bd in ii. 6.)
8
اعتذب He made [the] two ends (عَذَبَتَيْنِ) of
his turban to hang down behind. (O, K, TA.)
10
استعذب المَآءَ He reckoned, or esteemed,
the water sweet. (O, Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  And He
sought sweet water: you say, استعذب لِأَهْلِهِ he
sought sweet water for his family. (TA.) ―
-b3-
And He drank the water sweet. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And
He drew sweet water. (S, O, K. *) One says,
يُسْتَعْذَبُ لِفُلَانٍ مِنْ بِئْرِ كَذَا i. e. [Sweet water] is
drawn for such a one from such a well. (S, O.)
―
-b5-  And استعذب لَهُ المَآءَ He brought to him sweet
water. (TA.)
-A2-  See also 4.
12
اعذوذب, like اِحْلَولَى, said of water, It
was, or became, sweet, [like عَذُبَ,] or very sweet.
(Lb, TA.)
عَذْبٌ Sweet water: (S, O:) or water, (Msb,)
or wine, or beverage, and food, (K,) that is easy
and agreeable to be drunk or swallowed: (Msb,
K:) pl. عِذَابٌ (O, Msb, TA) and عُذُوبٌ. (TA.)
You say رَكِيَّةٌ عَذْبَةٌ [A well of sweet water] : and
مَآءٌ عَذْبٌ [sweet water]: and also مَآءَةٌ عَذْبَةٌ [a
sweet water]: and مَآءٌ عِذَابٌ [sweet water or
waters], using a pl. epithet in this last case because مَآءٌ is a coll. gen. n., of which مَآءَةٌ is the
n. un. (TA.) And Aboo-Heiyeh En-Nemeree
says, describing water,
لَهُ غَلَلٌ بَيْنَ الإِجَامِ عُذُوبُ
[Having sweet water permeating amid the reedbeds, or the thickets]: he uses غَلَلٌ as a coll.
gen. n., and therefore pluralizes the epithet. (L,
TA.) ―
-b2-  One says also نِساءٌ عِذَابُ الثَّنَايَا
(assumed tropical:)  [Women sweet in respect of the front teeth].
(A.) ―
-b3-  And إِنَّهُ لَعَذْبُ اللِّسَانِ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily he is sweet
in respect of the tongue]; likening his tongue to
the water that is termed عَذْب. (Lh, TA.)
-A2-
Also A sort of trees; (K, TA;) the same that is
called عَذَبٌ [q. v.]. (TA.)
عَذَبٌ, (S, O, K,) [a coll. gen. n.] of which, in
all its senses, the n. un. is darr; عَذَبَةٌ, (K, TA,)
Motes, or particles of rubbish or the like, (S, O,
K, TA,) floating upon water. (TA.) [In this
sense, it is said in the S and O that عَذَبَةٌ is its
sing. or n. un.] One says مَآءٌ ذُو عَذَبٍ Water
abounding with such motes or particles. (S, O.
See also عَذِبٌ.) And ↓ عَذِبَةٌ has the same meaning as the n. un. of عَذَبٌ in this sense: (K:)
and signifies likewise, as also ↓ عَذَبَةٌ and ↓ عَذْبَةٌ,
(L, K,) this last mentioned by IAar, (L,) [the
green substance called] طُحْلُب (L, K, TA) and
عَرْمَض and the like, (L, TA,) or طُحْلُب and
dung (دِمْن), floating upon water. (TA.) ―
-b2-
And What comes forth next after the fœtus from
the womb. (O, K.)
-A2-  Also A sort of trees,
(AHn, O, K,) of the shrub-kind: (AHn, O:)
the same that is called عَذْبٌ. (TA.)
-A3-  And
The pieces of rag that women hold when wailing
for the dead; as also مَعَاذِبُ, (O, K,) pl. of
↓ مَعْذَبَةٌ [or probably مِعْذَبَةٌ, like its syn. مِئْلَاةٌ,
originally مِئْلَوَةٌ], or , accord. to AA, an anomalous
pl. of [the n. un. of عَذَبٌ, i. e.] عَذَبَةٌ: (O:) one
of such pieces of rag is also called مِعْوَزٌ, as well
as عَذَبَةٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And Straps, or thongs: (S,
O:) or the extremities thereof; as also ↓ عَذَبَاتٌ.
(TA.) So in the saying of Dhu-r-Rummeh, (S,
O, TA,) describing dogs of the chase, (O,)
غُضْفٌ مُهَرَّتَةُ الأَشْدَاقِ ضَارِيَةٌ
مِثْلُ السَّرَاحِينِ فِى أَعْنَاقِهَا العَذَبُ
[Having pendulous ears, wide in the sides of the
mouth, habituated to the chase, resembling wolves,
with straps, or thongs, or the extremities thereof,
upon their necks]. (S, O, TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, (K,) or
↓ عَذَبَةٌ, in this and other senses following, (S, O,
Msb, &c.,) [the former evidently wrong, the
latter (as is said in the K) being its n. un. in all
its senses,] The string with which a balance,
or pair of scales, is raised. (S, O, Msb, K.) ―
-b4-
And The end, or extremity, of a whip; (Mgh in
art. ثمر, and Msb;) its tail; also called its ثَمَرَة:
(Mgh ubi suprà:) or its عِلَاقَة, (TA in the present
art.,) which means the [suspensory] thong in the
handle thereof: (TA in art. علق:) or [it may
have both of these significations, for it is said
that it is] one of the عَذَبَتَانِ of a whip. (S, O.)
―
-b5-  The end, or extremity of anything. (A, K.)
―
-b6-  The extremity of the tongue; (S, O, Msb;)
its [tip or] narrow extremity: (TA:) pl. ↓ عَذَبَاتٌ.
(Msb.) One says, أَلْسِنَتِهِمْ ↓ الحَقُّ عَلَى عَذَبَاتِ
[Truth is on the tips of their tongues]. (A, TA.)
―
-b7-  The extremity of the penis of a camel: (ISd,
K, TA:) or the extremity of a camel's penis thin
in the fore part. (TA.) ―
-b8-  The part that hangs
down of the [thong called] شِرَاك [q. v.] of a
sandal. (O, TA. [See also ذُؤَابَةٌ.]) ―
-b9-  A piece
of skin which is hung behind the hinder part
(مُؤْخِرَة, O, K, or مُؤَخَّرَة, CK) of the [camel's
saddle called] رَحْل, (O, K,) from its upper portion; (O;) also termed ذُؤَابَةٌ. (TA in art. ذأب.)
―
-b10-  And عَذَبٌ [accord. to the TA, but correctly
↓ عَذَبَةٌ, (see 8,)] The portion [i. e. end] of a
turban, that is made to hang down between the
shoulders. (TA.) ―
-b11-  And the same, [correctly
↓ عَذَبَةٌ, as is shown by what follows,] A piece
of rag [or strip of linen or the like, called in
French cravate,] that is bound upon the head of
a spear. (TA.) One says, خَفَقَتْ عَلَى رَأْسِهِ
العَذَبُ (A, TA) i. e. خِرَقُ الأَلْوِيَةِ [The cravates
fluttered over his head]. (A.) ―
-b12-  And ↓ عَذَبَةٌ
signifies also A branch of a tree; (S, O, Msb;)
and so ↓ عَذِبَةٌ. (TA.)
عَذِبٌ (K, TA) and ↓ ذُو عَذَبٍ (TA) Water
overspread by [the green substance termed] طُحْلُب:
(K, TA:) or abounding therewith, and with motes,
or particles of rubbish or the like: (TA:) [or the
latter signifies as expl. before: see عَذَبٌ, third
sentence:] عَذِبٌ is thought by ISd to be a possessive epithet, [meaning ذُو عَذَبٍ,] because he
found no verb belonging to it. (TA.)
-A2-  عَذِبٌ
is also syn. with عَظِبٌ meaning A man alighting,
or abiding, in places of dried-up herbage, and in
a waterless desert. (TA in art. عظب.)
عَذْبَةٌ: see عَذَبٌ.
-A2-  Also A certain tree, that
kills camels, (O, K, TA,) if they eat thereof.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And A well-known medicine. (K, TA.
[In some copies of the K, دَآءٌ, or “ disease,” is
put for دَوَآءٌ, accord. to the TK, as observed by
Freytag.])
عَذَبَةٌ, and its pl. عَذَبَاتٌ: see عَذَبٌ, in nine
places. ―
-b2-  The pl. above mentioned signifies also
The legs of a she-camel. (TA.)
عَذِبَةٌ: see عَذَبٌ, fourth and last sentences.
-A2-
Also What is taken forth from طَعَام [i. e. wheat,
or corn in general,] and thrown away; (Lh, K,
TA;) being the worst thereof; also termed عَذِرَةٌ.
(Lh, TA in art. عذر.)
-A3-  And Pasturage, or
herbage: so in the phrase مَآءٌ مَا بِهِ عَذِبَةٌ, (O,)
or مَآء لَا عَذِبَةَ فِيهِ [Water where is no pasturage,
or herbage]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  It is also expl. in copies
of the K as signifying, with the article, مَا أَحَاطَ
مِنَ الدِّرَّةِ: but the right explanation is مَا أَحَاطَ
بِالدَّبْرَةِ [app. meaning The ridge of earth that surrounds a sown piece of ground to retain the water
for irrigation (see دَبْرٌ)], as in the M and L &c.
(TA.)
عَذَبِىٌّ, (thus in my copies of the S,) or عُذَبِىٌّ,
(O, K, TA,) with the pointed ذ, accord. to AA,
mentioned in the T in art. عدب, as written
with the unpointed د, and here said in the K to
be syn. with عُدَبِىٌّ, (TA,) Generous in natural
dispositions. (AA, S, O, TA.)
أَصَابَهُ عَذَابُ عِذَبِينَ, (O, K, TA,) with kesr to
the ع and fet-h to the ذ, (O, TA,) like بِلَغِينَ,
(K, TA, in the CK عُذَبِينَ like بُلَغِينَ,) and
أَصَابَهُ العِذَبُونَ, (O, TA,) [May the punishment
that will not be remitted befall him, or] may his
punishment not be remitted: (O, K, TA:) so says
Ibn-Buzurj. (O, TA.)
عَذَابٌ Punishment, castigation, or chastisement,
[or] such as serves to give warning to others than
the sufferer, or to restrain the offender from repeating the offence; syn. عُقُوبَةٌ, (S, O,) or نَكَالٌ:
(K, and Ksh and Bd in ii. 6:) so termed from
عَذَبَ “ he prevented ” &c.; because it prevents
the person punished from returning to the like of
his offence, and prevents others from doing the
like of that which he has done: (MF, TA:) [it
generally signifies any corporal punishment:]
and, by an extension of the original signification,
any [infliction of] pain that disgraces, or puts to
shame: (Ksh and Bd ubi suprà:) originally,
beating: afterwards used to signify any painful
punishment: [torture; or torment:] and metaphorically applied to (tropical:)  an affair, or event, that
is difficult, distressing, afflicting, or troublesome;
whence the saying, السَّفَرُ قِطْعَةٌ مِنَ العَذَابِ [Travel
is a portion of that which is difficult, &c.; or of
torment]: (Msb:) in the Kur xxiii. 78, it means
hunger, or famine: (Zj, O, TA:) the pl. is أَعْذِبَةٌ:
(Zj, K, TA:) the author of the K says in art.
نهر [voce نَهَارٌ] that it has no pl.: [and it seems
to be doubted whether it have a pl. because it is
properly an inf. n. though its verb in the unaugmented form is not used:] but MF observes
that if it be a name for that whereby one is prevented [from repeating an offence], as hunger, or
famine, agreeably with what Zj says, there is no
reason why it should not have this pl. (TA.)
عَذُوبٌ: see عَاذِبٌ, in seven places.
عَذَابَةٌ The womb; thus mentioned by Az, on
the authority of El-Mundhiree and AHeyth,
with the pointed ذ; (O, TA;) i. q. عَدَابَةٌ.
(K, TA.)
عَاذِبٌ and ↓ عَذُوبٌ, applied to a horse or the
like, &c., (S, O,) Such as is standing still, or
stopping from fatigue, (قَائِمٌ, S,) that will not
eat nor drink: (S, O:) or abstaining, or that
abstains, from eating, by reason of intense thirst;
(K, TA;) applied to a man, and an ass, and a
horse: but Az says that the assertion respecting
these two epithets that they signify [a horse, &c.]
that neither eats nor drinks is more correct than
the assertion respecting ↓ عَذُوبٌ that it signifies
[one] that abstains from eating by reason of his
thirst: also, that عَاذِبٌ signifies any animal, but
generally a horse and a camel, that will not eat
anything: accord. to Th, this and ↓ عَذُوبٌ signify
a horse or the like standing still, or stopping from
fatigue, (قَائِمٌ,) that raises his head, and will not
eat nor drink; and the former, that passes a
night without eating anything: (TA:) the pl. of
عَاذِبٌ is عُذُوبٌ, like as سُجُودٌ is a pl. of سَاجِدٌ:
and the pl. of ↓ عَذُوبٌ is عُذُبٌ, and, accord. to
A 'Obeyd, عُذُوبٌ [like as هُجُودٌ is pl. of هَجُودٌ]:
Az says that this is a mistake, for a word of the
measure فَعُولٌ does not form a pl. of the measure
فُعُولٌ; but [SM says] this is an extr. instance;
and he who preserves an authority in his mind
is an evidence against him who does not. (TA.)
One says, ↓ بَاتَ عَذُوبًا, meaning He passed the
night without eating or drinking anything; because abstaining therefrom. (O.) ―
-b2-  عَاذِبٌ signifies also [Unsheltered;] having no covering
between him and the sky; (O, K;) and so
↓ عَذُوبٌ. (K, TA.) El-Jaadee says, describing
a wild bull (ثَوْر وَحْشِىّ [a species of bovine antelope]) that had passed the night alone, tasting
nothing,
لِلسَّمَآءِ كَأَنَّهُ ↓ فَبَاتَ عَذُوبًا
سُهَيْلٌ إِذَا مَا أَفْرَدَتْهُ الكَوَاكِبُ
[And he passed the night exposed without shelter
to the sky, as though he were Canopus when the
other stars have left him solitary]. (TA.)
الأَعْذَبَانِ [The two most sweet things;] saliva
(الرِّيق, S, O, K, or الرُّضَاب, A) and wine: (S,
A, O, K: [for, in the amorous language of the
Arab, the sweetness of the saliva of his beloved
is often praised:]) or food and coïtus. (K.)
لِجَامٌ مُعْذِبٌ A bridle that withholds from going
away in a headlong manner. (O.)
مَعْذَبَةٌ [or مِعْذَبَةٌ?]: see عَذَبٌ.
مُعَذَّبَةٌ [for خَمْرٌ مُعَذَّبَةٌ] Wine mixed [with
water, or with some other thing or things]. (A,
TA.) ―
-b2-  And معذب [app. مُعَذَّب] is applied by
the vulgar to Fresh ripe dates soaked with water.
(TA voce مَنْقُوشٌ.)
-A2-  سَوْطٌ مُعَذَّبٌ A whip having
an عِلَاقَة [or عَذَبَة] attached to it. (TA.)
اِمْرَأَةٌ مَعْذَابُ الرِّيقِ A woman whose saliva is
pleasant to be swallowed, and sweet. (TA.)
