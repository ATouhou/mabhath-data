(TA.) [See, again, عَدْلٌ below.] ―
-b3-  [عَدَلَ signifies also He declined, deviated, or turned aside or
away; and particularly from the right course:

like, to such a one; (K;) [and] so به ↓ عادلهُ:
(S:) or, accord. to some, العَدْلُ signifies the
rating a thing as equal to a thing of another kind
so as to make it like the latter. (TA.) One says,
عَدَلْتُ هٰذَا بِهٰذَا I made this to be like and to

made an equiponderance to subsist between the two
things. (TA.) ―
-b4-  فُلَانٌ يَعْدِلُ فُلَانًا Such a one is
equal to such a one. (TA.) And يَعْدِلُهُ He, or
it, is like him, or it. (Fr, S, O.) [Hence] one

inf. n. عَدْلٌ, (TA,) It was, or became, equiponderant to it; as also ↓ عادلهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُعَادَلَةٌ.

(K, TA.) ―
-b5-  And عَدَلَ, aor.

third sentence.]
-A3-  عَدُلَ, [aor.
عَدُلَ,] inf. n. عَدَالَةٌ (S,
O, Msb) and عُدُولَةٌ, (Msb,) He (a man, S, O,

even; namely, a thing; as, for instance, an arrow;
(TA;) right, or in a right condition; direct, or
rightly directed; (S, O, Msb, K, TA;) and so
↓ عَدَلَهُ. (O, K.) Hence, فَعَدَّلَكَ and ↓ فَعَدَلَكَ,
accord. to different readers, in the Kur [lxxxii. 7,
which I would rather render And hath made
thee symmetrical]: (O:) or the latter means
and hath turned thee from unbelief to belief;
(IAar, O, TA;) or, accord. to Fr, and hath
turned thee to whatever form He pleased, beautiful or ugly, tall or short: but Az says that the
former reading was the more pleasing to Fr, and
is the better. (TA.) ―
-b3-  He made it equal;
(Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) namely, a pair of scales,
or a weight, (K, TA,) and a measure, &c. (TA.)
Hence, قِسْمَةُ التَّعْدِيلِ i. e. The division of a thing
[in an equal manner] with regard to the value
and utility, not with regard to the quantity, so
that the smaller portion may be equal to the
larger portion in value and utility. (Msb.) You
say, عَدَّلَ القَسَّامُ الأَنْصِبَآءَ لِلْقَسْمِ بَيْنَ الشُّرَكَآءِ i. e.
[The divider of inheritances] made equal the
shares [for distribution among the participators].

also He attributed to him (i. e. a witness, Msb)
what is termed عَدَالَة [inf. n. of عَدُلَ]; (O,
Msb;) described him as possessing that quality;
(Msb;) pronounced him to be veracious, and
good, or righteous; (K;) pronounced him to be
such as is termed عَدْل [q. v.]: (TA:) تَعْدِيلُ
الشُّهُودِ is the pronouncing the witnesses to be عُدُول
[pl. of عَدْلٌ]. (S.) ―

الوَزْنِ [It is equal in weight; is equiponderant].
(IF, Msb.) And يُعَادِلُكَ فِى الوَزْنِ وَالقَدْرِ [He is
equal to thee in weight and in size: as one who
rides with thee in a مَحْمِل]. (S.) يُعَادِلُهُ فِى
القِيمَةِ وَالمَنْفَعَةِ [It is equal to it in value and

bound them two upon the two sides of a camel [or
of a camel used for carrying water for irrigation,
so that they counterbalanced each other] like the
[two loads called] عِدْلَانِ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And فُلَانٌ
يُعَادِلُ أَمْرَهُ, and يُقَسِّمُهُ, (O, and so accord. to a
copy of the S,) or عَدَالٌ, (so in another copy of
the S,) inf. n. يُعَادِلُ هٰذَا الأَمْرَ, Such a one wavers, or vacillates, [in his case] between two affairs, hesitating
which of them he shall do. (S, O.) And عادل أَمْرَهُ
تَعْدِيلٌ He is in a state of entanglement
in this affair, and does not execute it: (K:) he
is in doubt respecting it. (TA.) And عادل أَمْرَهُ
He paused [in his case], hesitating between two
affairs, which he should do; as also ↓ عدّلهُ inf. n.
تَعْدِيلٌ: and hence, in the trad. of the مِعْرَاج [or
ladder by which Mohammad is related to have
ascended from Jerusalem to Heaven], ↓ فَعَدَّلْتُ
بَيْنَهُمَا [And I paused in hesitation between them
two]; meaning that they were equal in his estimation, and he could not make choice of either
of them. (TA.) And عَادَلْتُ بَيْنَ أَمْرَيْنِ أَيَّهُمَا
آتِى I wavered, or vacillated, between two affairs,
hesitating which of them I should do. (TA.)
المُعَادَلَةُ is The doubting respecting two affairs:
and one says, أَنَا فِى عِدَالٍ مِنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ I am in
doubt respecting this affair, whether I should do
it or leave it undone: (TA:) or العِدَالُ is the
considering deliberately respecting the case of two
affairs that have occurred to one, when one knows
not to which of them he should betake himself.
(IAar, K.) And The case of one person's saying
“ There is in it something remaining ” and another's saying “ There is not in it anything remaining. ” (S, O.) And one says, when he wavers,
or vacillates, between two affairs, hesitating which
of them he shall do, and then a right opinion
occurs to him, and he determines upon that which
is the more fit in his estimation, قَطَعْتُ العِدَالَ
فِى أَمْرِى وَمَضَيْتُ عَلَى عَزْمِى [I cut short wavering in my affair, and executed my determination]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And عادل signifies also It became crooked, or bent. (K.)

being, or becoming, intermediate in quality.]
7
إِنْعَدَلَ see 1, former half, in two places.
8
اعتدل It was, or became, right, or in a
right condition; direct, or rightly directed;
straight, or even; (S, O, Msb, TA;) equal; (as
a pair of scales, or a weight, and a measure, &c.;
TA;) equable, or uniform; (Msb, TA;) [symmetrical, proportionate,] suitable in itself [or in its
parts]. (K.) The saying, cited by Sh,
وَاعْتَدَلَتْ ذَاتُ السَّنَامِ الأَمْيَلِ
means And she that had an inclining hump became straight [and erect] in her hump by reason
of fatness. (TA.) And one says جَارِيَةٌ حَسَنَةُ

of stature [or proportion]. (A, TA.) And اعتدل
الشِّعْرُ The poetry, or verse, was, or became,
measured, and right in its feet. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also
It was, or became, of a middling sort, in quantity,
or quality; (K, TA;) as a body between tallness
and shortness, and water between the hot and the
cold; and [moderate, or temperate,] as a day of
which the air is pleasant. (TA.)
عَدْلٌ Equity, justice, or rectitude; contr. of
جَوْرٌ; (S, O, Msb, K, TA;) i. e. i. q. قَصْدٌ, in
affairs; (Msb;) and قِسْطٌ; (S, M, Mgh, &c., in
art. قسط;) and سَوِيَّةٌ; (O, K;) and اِسْتِقَامَةٌ;
(IAar, K;) and a thing that is established in the
minds as being right; (K, TA;) as also ↓ مَعْدِلَةٌ
(S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ مَعْدَلَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and
↓ عَدَالَةٌ and ↓ عُدُولَةٌ: (K:) or, as some say, it is
the mean between excess and falling short: and
Er-Rághib says, it is of two sorts: one is absolute, such that reason requires the inference of its
goodness; and this will not at any time be abrogated, nor described as a mode of transgression;
as the doing good to him who does good to thee,
and the abstaining from harming him who abstains from harming thee: and the other is such
as is known to be عَدْل by the law; and this may
be abrogated sometimes; as retaliation, and fines
for wounds and maimings, and the taking the
property of the apostate; and this is what is
meant by the saying in the Kur [xvi. 92], إِنَّ اللّٰهَ
يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالْإِحْسَانِ i. e. [Verily God commandeth] equality in recompensing, if good, with
good, and if evil, with evil, and the requiting of
good with more good, and of evil with less evil:
[see also 4 in art. حسن:] and he says of ↓ عَدَالَةٌ
and ↓ مَعْدِلَةٌ, that each is a term requiring the
inference of equality, and is used with a regard to
correlation. (TA.) One says, بَسَطَ الوَالِى عَدْلَهُ
and ↓ مَعْدِلَتَهُ (S, O) and ↓ مَعْدَلَتَهُ (S) [The
governor, or ruler, largely extended his equity, or
justice]. And ↓ فُلَانٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ المَعْدَلَةِ, (S,) or
↓ المَعْدِلَةِ, (O,) i. e. من اهل العَدْلِ [Such a one
is of the people of equity, &c.]. (S, O.) وَأَشْهِدُوا
ذَوَىْ عَدْلٍ مِنْكُمْ, in the Kur [lxv. 2], is said by
Sa'eed Ibn-El-Museiyib to mean ذَوَىْ عَقْلٍ [i. e.
And make ye to be witnesses two persons of intelligence from among you: but this rendering I
think questionable]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also Repayment,
requital, compensation, or recompense. (K.) ―
-b3-
And Ransom, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) when regard
is had therein to the meaning of equality, or equivalence. (TA.) This is [said to be] the meaning in
the phrase of the Kur [v. 96], أَوْ عَدْلُ ذٰلِكَ صِيَامًا
[Or the ransom thereof by fasting: but this is
generally expl. as meaning or the like thereof of
fasting; (see عِدْلٌ;) i. e., in lieu of feeding a
number of poor men, one shall fast the like
number of days]. (S, O.) And so [accord. to
some] in the saying, occurring in a trad., لَا يُقْبَلُ
مِنْهُ صَرْفٌ وَلَا عَدْلٌ [of which see various explanations (including three renderings here following) in art. صرف]. (O, Msb.) ―
-b4-  And Measure;
syn. كَيْلٌ. (K.) So in the phrase أَعْطَاهُ بِالعَدْلِ
[He gave him by measure]. (TK.) ―
-b5-  And An
obligatory act or divine ordinance. (En-Nadr,
O, K.) ―
-b6-  And A supererogatory act. (O, K.)
-A2-
Also One who acts equitably, justly, or rightly;
and so ↓ عَادِلٌ: (K, TA:) or the latter signifies
thus: (S, O:) and the former [particularly] signifies a man approved and satisfactory in testimony; originally an inf. n.; (S, O, TA;) whose
testimony is approved and available; (Msb;) a
man whose testimony is allowable, or legally admissible, as also ↓ عَادِلٌ; a man whose saying, and
whose judgment, or judicial decision, are approved;
and, accord. to Ibráheem, one from whom a thing
occasioning doubt, or suspicion, or evil opinion,
has not appeared: being originally an inf. n., it
means ذُو عَدْلٍ: or, accord. to IJ, it is an intensive epithet, as though meaning possessing
every kind of عَدْل: (TA:) one says رَجُلٌ عَدْلٌ,
(S, O, Msb, * K,) and اِمْرَأَةٌ عَدْلٌ and عَدْلَةٌ,
(Msb, K,) the latter mentioned by IJ, (TA,)
and رَجُلَانِ عَدْلٌ and عَدْلَانِ, (Msb, * TA,) and
قَوْمٌ عَدْلٌ (S, O, Msb, * K) and نِسْوَةٌ عَدْلٌ (TA)
and قَوْمٌ عُدُولٌ, (S, O, Msb, * K,) عُدُولٌ being pl.
of عَدْلٌ, (S, O, Msb,) or of عَادِلٌ, (K,) and عَدْلٌ
used in a pl. sense being a quasi-pl. n. of عَادِلٌ,
(M, K,) like تَجْرٌ [of تَاجِرٌ] and شَرْبٌ [of شَارِبٌ];
(M, TA;) or رِجَالٌ عَدْلٌ and نِسْوَةٌ عَدْلٌ mean
رِجَالٌ ذَوُو عَدْلٍ and نِسْوَانٌ ذَوَاتُ عَدْلٍ. (TA.) ―
-b2-
العَدْلُ as one of the names of God means He
whom desire does not cause to incline, or decline,
so that he should deviate from the right course
in judgment. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And one says, هٰذَا عَدْلٌ
بَيْنَهُمَا, meaning This is intermediate in quality
between them two, not in the utmost degree of
goodness nor in the extreme degree of badness.
(Mgh.) And مَكَانٌ عَدْلٌ بَيْنَ فَرِيقَيْنِ [A place
equidistant, or midway, between two parties]. (S
in art. سوى.) ―
-b4-  See also عِدْلٌ, throughout the
greater part of the paragraph.
-A3-  عَدْلٌ is also the
name of a certain chief of the [body of armed men
called] شُرَط, (S, O,) or شُرْطَة, (K,) of a تُبَّع [or
King of El-Yemen], who, when he desired the
slaughter of a man, delivered him to this person;
(S, O, K;) whereupon the people said, وُضِعَ عَلَى
يَدَىْ عَدْلٍ [He has been consigned to the hands of
'Adl]; (S, O;) and this was afterwards said of
anything of which one despaired. (S, O, K.)
[Meyd mentions عَلَى يَدَىْ عَدْلٍ, as a prov.,
without وُضِعَ: see Freytag's Arab. Prov. ii. 80.]
عِدْلٌ The like (IAar, Zj, O, K) of a thing;
(IAar, O;) as also ↓ عَدْلٌ; syn. مِثْلٌ; (IAar,
Zj, O, K;) and نَظِيرٌ [which signifies the same,
or the equal]; and so ↓ عَدِيلٌ: (K:) or, accord.
to Er-Rághib, ↓ عَدْلٌ and عِدْلٌ are nearly the
same; but the former is used in relation to what
is perceived mentally, as in the phrase of the Kur
[v. 96], أَوْ عَدْلُ ذٰلِكَ صِيَامًا [mentioned voce عَدْلٌ];
and عِدْلٌ and ↓ عَدِيلٌ, in relation to what is perceived by the sense, as things weighed and things
numbered and things measured: Ibn-'Ámir, however, read او عِدْلُ ذلك; and Ks and the people of
El-Medeeneh, with fet-h [i. e. عَدْلُ]: (TA:) or
عِدْلُ الشَّىْءِ, with kesr, signifies the like of the
thing in kind, (Mgh, Msb,) or in quantity, or
measure, or the like, (Msb,) or also in quantity,
or measure, or the like, (Mgh,) and IF says, in
weight; (Msb;) and ↓ عَدْلُهُ, with fet-h, (Mgh,
Msb,) its like, (Mgh,) or what will stand in its
stead, (Msb,) of a thing different in kind, (Mgh,
Msb;) whence the phrase of the Kur أَوْ عَدْلُ ذٰلِكَ
صِيَامًا [mentioned above]; عَدْل being originally
an inf. n.: (Msb:) Akh says, العِدْلُ, with kesr,
signifies المِثْلُ; and ↓ العَدْلُ, with fet-h, is originally an inf. n., but is made a subst. to denote
المِثْلُ in order to distinguish it from the عِدْل of
goods or commodities [which will be expl. in
what follows]: Fr says, العِدْلُ, with kesr, is the
like (المِثْلُ), as in the saying عِنْدِى عِدْلُ غُلَامِكَ
[I have the like of thy boy or young man] and
عِدْلُ شَاتِكَ [the like of thy sheep or goat]; but
you say ↓ العَدْلُ, with nasb [i. e. fet-h] to the ع,
when you mean the [equal in] value, of what is
different in kind; though sometimes it is pronounced with kesr by some of the Arabs, app. by
an error on their part: (S, O:) or some allow
one's saying عِنْدِى عِدْلُ غُلَامِكَ as meaning I
have the like of thy boy or young man, [and app.
↓ عَدْلُهُ also,] and عَدْلُهُ with fet-h only as meaning
his value: (TA:) but Zj says that العَدْلُ and
العِدْلُ both signify the like, whether it be of the
same kind or of a different kind; and if one
make a mistake, he should not say that some of
the Arabs have erred: (O:) the pl. (S, O, K)
of عِدْلٌ, by common consent, (S, O,) is أَعْدَالٌ,
(S, O, K,) and [that of ↓ عَدِيلٌ is] عُدَلَآءُ. (K.)
―
-b2-  Also The half of a load, (K, TA,) such as
is on either of the two sides of the camel; (TA;)
or a burden [borne on one side of a beast, counterbalancing another on the other side, or] made
equiponderant to another burden: (Az, TA:) pl.
[of pauc.] أَعْدَالٌ and [of mult.] عُدُولٌ: (Sb, K:)
and ↓ عَدِيلٌ signifies the equal of a person in
weight and measure or size or the like (S, K, * TA)
in the [vehicle called] مَحْمِل: (TA:) Sb says
that it signifies a human being that is the equal of
another [in weight]; distinguishing it from عِدْلٌ,
which, he says, is applied only to goods, or commodities: (IB, TA:) [but] ↓ عَدِيلَتَانِ signifies
two sacks (غِرَارَتَانِ); because each counter balances,
or is equiponderant to, the other. (TA.) Hence
one says of the عُدُول of an evil judicial decision,
مَا هُمْ عُدُولٌ وَلٰكِنْ عُدُولٌ [meaning They are not
witnesses whose testimony is approvable, but equalized loads of merchandise]. (TA.) And [hence
also] one says, وَقَعَ المُصْطَرِعَانِ عِدْلَىْ بَعِيرٍ, meaning The two [men wrestling] fell together, neither
of them having thrown down the other. (TA.
[See also عِكْمٌ.])
عَدَلٌ The equalizing of the [two burdens, or half-loads, called] عِدْلَانِ. (IAar, O, K.)
عَدَلَةٌ: see what next follows, in two places.
عُدَلَةٌ Men who pronounce witnesses to be veracious, and good, or righteous; (AZ, IAar, O, K, *
TA;) as also ↓ عَدَلَةٌ; (K;) and the former is
also applied to a man who does so: (AZ, O,
TA: *) or the former is applied to a single per-
son, and ↓ عَدَلَةٌ is applied to a pl. number. (AA,
K, TA.)
عَدِيلٌ: see عِدْلٌ, in four places.
عَدَالَةٌ: see عَدْلٌ, in two places. It is an inf. n.
of عَدُلَ (S, O, Msb) said of a witness; like ↓ عُدُولَةٌ:
and signifies The quality of a witness such as is
termed عَدْلٌ [q. v.]: it is expl. as being a quality
the regard of which necessitates the guarding
against what falls short of the requirements of
manly virtue or moral goodness, habitually and
evidently; which evident falling short thereof is
not effected by small instances of lapses or falls
into wrongdoing, and by perversion of speech,
because mistake and forgetfulness are supposable
[as the causes thereof], and interpretation not
according to the obvious meaning; but it is when
such is the known and repeated practice of the
person: regard is to be had to the goodness, or
honesty, of every individual, and his usual practice
in respect of his apparel, and his dealing in selling
and buying, and the conveyance of goods, and
other things; and when he does that which is not
suitable to him, without necessity, his testimony is
impugned; otherwise it is not. (Msb.)
عُدُولَةٌ: see عَدْلٌ, first sentence: and عَدَالَةٌ.
عَدِيلَتَانِ: see عِدْلٌ, last quarter.
عَدَوْلَى An old, tall tree: (K:) or ↓ شَجَرٌ عَدَوْلِىٌّ
signifies old trees; one of which is termed عَدَوْلِيَّةٌ:
or, accord. to AHn, ↓ عَدَوْلِىٌّ signifies anything
old. (TA.)
-A2-  See also the next following paragraph.
عَدَوْلِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
two places.
-A2-  Also, thus correctly, as in the S,
(TA, [and thus, app., accord. to the K, though
this is thought by SM, and not altogether without reason, to require by its context the reading
of ↓ عَدَوْلَى, as does, app., the O,]) A seaman,
or mariner. (S, O, K, TA.) ―
-b2-  And pl. [app.
a mistake for n. un.] of عَدَوْلِيَّةٌ, (K,) which latter
means Certain ships or boats, (O, K, TA,) or a
[sort of] ship or boat, (S,) or it is an epithet
applied to certain ships or boats, (EM p. 58,) so
called as being of عَدَوْلَى, (S, O, * K, TA,) meaning a city of El-Bahreyn, (S, O, * TA,) not meaning, as would be imagined from the context in the
K, the tree [said to be] thus called; (TA;) mentioned in the poetry of Tarafeh, (S, O, TA,) in
the fourth verse of his Mo'allakah, (O, TA,) and
thus expl. by As: (TA:) or meaning old; or
large: (O, TA:) or so called as being of a place
named عَدَوْلَاة, of the measure فَعَوْلَاة: (TA:) or
of عَدَوْل, a man who used to construct ships or
boats: or of a people who used to alight and
abide in Hejer. (O, K.)
عَادِلٌ: see عَدْلٌ, latter half, in two places. ―
-b2-
Also An attributer of a copartner, or of copartners, to God. (S, TA.) A woman is related
to have said to El-Hajjáj, يَا قَاسِطُ يَا عَادِلُ; [by
which she meant O deviater from the right course;
O attributer of a copartner, or of copartners, to
God;] (S, * O;) whereupon, the people thinking
that she was commending him, he said that by
her saying يا قاسط, she referred to the words of
the Kur [lxxii. 15] أَمَّا الْقَاسِطُونَ فَكَانُوا لِجَهَنَّمَ
حَطَبًا [expl. voce قَاسِطٌ; and by her saying يا
عادل, to the words in the same [vi. 151] وَهُمْ
بِرَبِّهِمْ يَعْدِلُونَ [expl. above, see 1]. (O.)
مَعْدِلٌ A place of turning away or back; as
also ↓ مَعْدُولٌ: so in the saying, مَا لَهُ مَعْدِلٌ and
↓ مَعْدُولٌ [There is for him no place of turning
away or back]: (K:) pl. مَعَادِلُ: Aboo-Khirásh
says,
تَضِيقُ عَلَىَّ الأَرْضُ ذَاتُ المَعَادِلِ
meaning [The earth having those ways in which
one may turn in various directions becomes strait
to me; or] having such amplitude that by reason
thereof one may turn in it to the right and left.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And A way, course, mode, or manner,
of acting or conduct or the like: thus in the saying
أَخَذَ فِى مَعْدِلِ الحَقِّ [He took to the right way of
acting], and مَعْدِلِ البَاطِلِ [the false, or wrong,
way of acting]: and in like manner one says,
اُنْظُرُوا إِلَى سُوْءِ مَعَادِلِهِ Look ye at his evil ways of
acting: and هُوَ سَدِيدُ المَعَادِلِ [He is one who
takes a right direction in respect of the ways of
acting]. (TA.)
مَعْدَلَةٌ: see عَدْلٌ, former half, in seven places.
مُعَدَّلٌ Anything straightened, or made even:
(S, O, K:) [&c.: see its verb.] ―

مُعْتَدِل [Right, or having a right direction;
straight, or even; equal; equable, or uniform;

in its parts: see its verb]. مُعْتَدِلَةٌ applied to a
she-camel means Whose limbs, or members, are
rendered even, one with another, (Lth, Az, TA,)
including her hump and other parts; as is the
case when she becomes fat: erroneously said by
Sh, on the authority of Mohárib, to be مُعَنْدَلَة,
belonging to art. عندل. (Az, TA.) ―
-b2-  And Of a
middling sort, in quantity, or quality; as a body
between tallness and shortness, and water between the hot and the cold; and [moderate, or
temperate,] as a day of which the air is pleasant;

فَرَسٌ مُعْتَدِلُ الفرقِ [app. الفَرْقِ] means A horse
whose غُرَّة [or blaze] occupies the middle of his
forehead, not reaching to one of the eyes nor
inclining upon one of the cheeks. (AO, TA.)
أَيَّامٌ مُعْتَدِلَاتٌ signifies [Days moderate in temperature; or] pleasant, not hot, days. (TA.) And
المُعْتَدِلَاتُ is applied to Forty nights of varying,
or alternating, heat and cold, commencing from
the [auroral] rising of Suheyl [or Canopus,
which, in Central Arabia, at the commencement
of the era of the Flight, was about the 4th of
August, O. S.]: (AZ, TA in art. صفر: see
صَفَرِىٌّ:) or the days of heat known by the appel-lation of وَقَدَاتُ سُهَيْلٍ [the most vehement heats of
Canopus]; as also المُعْتَذِلَاتُ [q. v.]. (El-

Anthol. Gramm. Arabe, p. 37 of the Arabic
text.)
