عثو and عثى
1
عَثَا, aor. يَعْثُو, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. عُثُوٌّ, (K, TA,)
[accord. to the CK عَثْوٌ, but] like سُمُوٌّ; (TA;) and
عَثِىَ, aor. يَعْثَى, (S, Msb, K,) which is of the
dial. of El-Hijáz, and of which the inf. n. is عَثًا;
(TA;) and عَثَى, aor. يَعْثَى and يَعْثِى; inf. n.
عُثِىٌّ and عِثِىٌّ and عَثَيَانٌ; (K, TA;) He acted

K:) or did so in the utmost degree: (TA:)
فِى الأَرْضِ [in the earth]: (S, TA:) the aor. of
one of the dial. vars. occurs in the Kur ii. 57;
&c.: some say that عثا, aor. يعثا, [or عِثَى, aor.
يَعْثَى,] is formed by transposition from عَاثَ, aor.
يَعِيثُ: (TA:) accord. to Er-Rághib, عَيْثٌ and
عُثِىٌّ, or عِثِىٌّ, and عُثُوٌّ are nearly alike; but عَيْثٌ
is mostly used in relation to that which is
perceived by sense; and عثىّ and عثوّ, in relation
to that which is perceived by the [mind or]
judgment: some say that عثوّ [as also عثىّ] is the
acting wrongfully, injuriously, or unjustly; and
sometimes does not involve the acting corruptly:
(MF and TA in art. عيث:) Lh says that عَثِىَ
is of the dial. of El-Hijáz, and is the [more]
approved form; and عاث is of the dial. of the
Benoo-Temeem. (TA in that art.) ―

عُثًى Hair: this is its primary signification.

-b2-  And, metaphorically, (tropical:)  Such as is straggling, of plants, or
herbage; as the نَصِىّ, and the بُهْمَى, and the
صِلِّيَان. (TA.) And [hence] one says, شَابَ
عُثَى الأَرْضِ (assumed tropical:)  The plants, or herbage, of the earth,
dried up, or became yellow: (K:) so in the Tekmileh, and so says ISk. (TA.)
عَثْوَةٌ A long لِمَّة [or quantity of hair descending
below the ear or to the shoulder]: (K:) pl. عُثًى,
like رُبًى; (so in some copies of the K;) or عُثَّى,
like رُبَّى; (so in other copies;) or عِثًى; like رِبًى;
(so in my MS. copy of the K; [app. taken from
the TA; the first of which (i. e. عُثًى) I hold
to be the right; (see the paragraph next preceding this;) though SM says what here
follows;]) it is correctly عِثى, like إِلى; agreeably with what is said in the M, i. e. that
العِثَى signifies اللِّمَمُ الطِّوَالُ. (TA.)
عُثْوَةٌ The state of the hair of the head when it
has become dry and matted, and has been long

and [the pl.] عُثْوٌ, and عُثْىٌ, a number of hyenas
together. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [The fem.] عَثْوَآءُ is also an
appellation applied to An old woman. (S, TA.)
―
-b4-  And the masc. signifies also Thick, gross, or
coarse, in size. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And Foolish, or stupid,
(S, K,) heavy, or dull. (S.) ―
-b6-  And One whose
colour inclines to blackness. (K.) ―
-b7-  And A
colour [itself] that inclines to blackness: (K,
TA:) or, accord. to the M, العثى [perhaps a
mistranscription] signifies a colour inclining to
blackness, with abundance of hair. (TA.)
