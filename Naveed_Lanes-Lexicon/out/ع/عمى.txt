عمى1
عَمِىَ, [aor. يَعْمَى,] inf. n. عَمًى, He was, or
became, blind, (S, Msb, K,) of both eyes; (Msb,
K, * TA;) as also ↓ اِعْمَاىَ, aor. يَعْمَايُ, inf. n.
اِعْمِيَآءٌ; (K;) [said by SM to be like اِرْعَوَى, aor.
يَرْعَوِى, inf. n. اِرْعِوَآءٌ; as though اِعْمَاىَ were originally اِعْمَىَّ, like as اِرْعَوَى is originally اِرْعَوَّ,
both being of the measure اِفْعلَّ; but he adds,
correctly, that,] accord. to Sgh, اِعْمَاىَ is originally
like اِدْهَامَمَ, which becomes اِدْهَامَّ, [i. e. it is
originally اِعْمَايَىَ,] but the latter ى is changed
into ا because of the fet-hah of the former, so that
it becomes اِعْمَايَا, and the two, thus differing, do
not easily admit of idghám (TA;) and sometimes the ى of اِعْمَاىَ is musheddedeh, (Sgh, K,
TA,) so that it becomes [↓ اِعْمَاىَّ, aor. يَعْمَاىُّ,
inf. n. اِعمِيَّآءٌ,] like اِدْهَامَّ, aor. يَدْهَامُّ, inf. n.
اِدْهِيمَامٌ; but this is by a straining of a point, and
not in use: (Sgh, TA:) and ↓ تعمّى, likewise,
signifies the same, (K, TA,) i. e., the same as
عَمِىَ. (TA.) And you say also, عَمِيَتْ عَيْنَاهُ His
two eyes were, or became, blind. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence
عَمًى is metaphorically used in relation to the
mind, as meaning (tropical:)  An erring; the connection
between the two meanings being the not finding,
or not taking, the right way: (Msb:) or the being
blind in respect of the mind: and in this sense,
the verb is as above, with the exception of the
measure اِفعَالَّ [and the abbreviated form of this].
(K, * TA. [اَفْعَالٍ in the CK in this passage is a
mistranscription, for افْعَالَّ.]) You say, عَمِىَ عَنْ
رُشْدِهِ, and حُجَّتِهِ, meaning لَمْ يَهْتَدِ (assumed tropical:)  [He did not,
or could not, become guided to his right course, and
his plea or the like; i. e. he was, or became, blind
thereto]. (TA.) And عَمِىَ عَنْ حَقِّهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He was,
or became, blind to his right, or due], like عَشِىَ
عَنْهُ. (TA in art. عشو.) ―
-b3-  One says also عَمِىَ
عَلَيْهِ الخَبَرُ (tropical:)  The information was, or became,
unapparent, obscure, or covert, to him. (Mgh,
Msb. *) And عَمِىَ عَلَيْهِ طَرِيقُهُ, (TA,) and الأَمْرُ,
(S, TA,) and الشِّعْرُ, and الكَلَامُ, (Har p. 190,) i. e.
(assumed tropical:)  [His way, or road, and the affair, and the
poetry, or verse, and the speech, or saying,] was,
or became, obscure, or dubious, to him; (S, TA,
and Har ubi suprá) and so ↓ عُمِّىَ; (TA;) and
↓ تعمّى. (Har ubi suprá.) Hence, accord. to
different readings, in the Kur [xxviii. 66], فَعَمِيَتْ
عَلَيْهِمُ الْأَنْبَآءُ and ↓ فَعُمِّيَتْ (assumed tropical:)  [And the pleas shall
be obscure, or dubious, to them]. (S, TA.) ―
-b4-  And
عَمِيتُ إِلَى كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  I betook myself to such a thing,
not desiring any other; as also عَطِشْتُ. (TA.
[Accord. to the TA, the inf. ns. of these two
verbs, thus used, are عميان and عطشان: but
they are correctly عَمًى and عَطَشٌ.])
-A2-  عَمَى
المَوْجُ, aor. يَعْمِى, (S, K,) inf. n. عَمْىٌ, (S,) The
waves cast the particles of rubbish, or the like, (S,
K, TA,) driving them to their upper, or uppermost, parts, (TA,) and the foam. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-
And عَمَى بِلُغَامِهِ, (K, TA,) aor. يَعْمِى, (TA,)
He (a camel) brayed, and cast the foam of his
mouth upon his head, or the upper part of his
head, or anywhere: (K, TA:) mentioned by ISd.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And [hence] عَمَانِى بِكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He cast
upon me a suspicion of such a thing. (TA.) ―
-b4-
عَمَى, aor. يَعْمِى, said of water, (K, TA,) and of
other things, (TA,) also signifies It flowed; (K,
TA;) and so هَمَى. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And عمى النَّبْتُ
[app. عَمَى] and ↓ اعتمى and اِعْتَمَّ are three syn.
dial. vars., (TA in this art.,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  The
plant, or herbage, became of its full height, and
blossomed; (S, K, TA, in explanation of the last,
in art. عم;) and became luxuriant, or abundant
and dense. (TA in that art.)
2
عمّاهُ, inf. n. تَعْمِيَةٌ, He rendered him blind,
of both eyes: (K, TA:) and (TA) so ↓ اعماهُ, (S,
Msb, TA,) said of God, (S, TA,) or of a man.
(Msb.) Hence the saying of Sá'ideh Ibn-Jueiyeh,
وَعَمَّى عَلَيْهِ المَوْتُ بَابَىْ طَرِيقِهِ
[And death rendered blind, to him, the two doors
of his way]; بابى طريقه meaning his two eyes.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And [hence] عَمَّيْتُ الخَبَرَ (assumed tropical:)  I made the
information unapparent, obscure, or covert. (Msb.)
And عمّى مَعْنَى البَيْتِ, inf. n. as above, (S, K,)
(assumed tropical:)  He made the meaning of the verse unapparent,
obscure, or covert. (K.) And عمّى مُرَادَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He
made his meaning enigmatical, or obscure, in his
speech, or language. (S, A, K, in art. لغز.) And
عمّى عَلَى إِنْسَانٍ شَيْئًا (assumed tropical:)  He made a thing obscure,
or dubious, to a man. (TA.) See also 1, latter
half, in two places. [And see مُعَمَّى.]
4
اعماهُ: see 2, first sentence. ―
-b2-  Also He
found him to be blind [app. meaning properly,
and also (assumed tropical:)  in mind]. (K, TA.) ―
-b3-  مَا أَعْمَاهُ means
only مَا أَعْمَى قَلْبَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [How blind is his mind!]:
(S, K:) for the verb of wonder is not formed
from that which is not significant of increase. (S.)
5
تعمّى [in its proper sense, and also in a tropical sense]: see 1, in two places.
6
تعامى He feigned himself أَعْمَى (S, K, TA)
[i. e. blind], in respect of the eyes [as is implied in
the S], ―
-b2-  and also (assumed tropical:)  in respect of the mind [as
is implied in the K]. (TA.) You say, تعامى
عَنْ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He feigned himself ignorant [of such
a thing], as though he did not see it; like تَعَاشَى
عَنْهُ. (TA in art. عشو.)
8
اِعْتَمَاهُ He chose it, selected it, or preferred it;
syn. اِخْتَارَهُ; (S, K, TA;) i. e., a thing; (S;)
formed by transposition from اِعْتَامَهُ [mentioned
in art. عيم]. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  And i. q. قَصَدَهُ [i. e.
He tended, betook himself, or directed himself or
his course or aim, to, or towards, him, or it;
&c.]; (K, TA;) like اِعْتَامَهُ. (TA in art. عيم.)

and هَمَا. (TA.)
عَمًى [sometimes written عَمًا] inf. n. of عَمِىَ
[q. v.]. (S, * Msb, K.) [Hence the saying, لَا
شَلَلًا وَلَا عَمًى: see 1 in art. شل. Hence also one
says, رَكِبَ أَمْرًا عَلَى العَمَى, meaning He ventured
upon, or embarked in, an affair blindly; like عَلَى
غَيْرِ بَصِيرَةِ.]
-A2-  See also أَعْمَآءٌ.

goodly is] the height, or the stature, of this man!

-A5-  And Dust; syn. غُبَارٌ. (K.)
-A6-  In the
saying of a rájiz, describing a skin of milk, because of its whiteness,
يَحْسَبُهُ الجَاهِلُ مَا كَانَ عَمَا
شَيْخًا عَلَى كُرْسِيِّةِ مُعَمَّمَا
[The ignorant would think it, while there was
remoteness, to be an old man upon his chair, turbaned,] the meaning is looking at it from afar;
for العَمَا in this case signifies remoteness. (TA.)
عَمٍ, originally عَمِىٌ: see أَعْمَى, in four places.
عَمْيَةٌ, a contraction of عَمِيَةٌ fem. of عَمٍ: see

عِمْيَةٌ [in the CK erroneously عَمْيَة] a subst.
from اِعْتَمَاهُ in the sense of اِخْتَارَهُ [signifying A
thing chosen, selected, or preferred; like خِيرَةٌ,

[q. v. voce أَعْمَى]. (S, TA.)

K ↓ عَمًى, and by some thus related in a trad.
mentioned in what follows, (TA,) Clouds: or,
accord. to AZ, [clouds] resembling smoke, surmounting the heads of mountains: (S, Msb:) or
lofty clouds: or [in the CK “ and ”] dense: (K,
TA:) or dense [clouds such as are termed] غَيْم:
(TA:) or raining clouds: or thin clouds: or
black: or white: or such as have poured forth
their water; (K, TA;) but have not become dissundered like mountains: and ↓ عَمَآءَةٌ [is the n. un.,
and] signifies a dense, covering, cloud; as also
↓ عَمَايَةٌ: or a dense portion of cloud: but some
disallow this, and make عَمَآءٌ to be [only] a coll. n.
(TA.) It is related in a trad. that, in reply to
the question “ Where was our Lord (meaning
the عَرْش [q. v.] of our Lord) before He created
his creatures? ” it was said, كَانَ فِى عَمَآءٍ تَحْتَهُ
هَوَآءٌ وَفَوْقَهُ هَوَآءٌ [He (i. e. his عَرْش) was in clouds,
or lofty clouds, &c., beneath which was a vacuity,
and above which was a vacuity]: or, accord. to
one relation, ↓ كَانَ فِى عَمًى [meaning He was
in a vacuity] i. e. there was not with Him anything: or, as some say, it means anything that
the intellectual faculties cannot perceive, and to

أَتَيْتُهُ صَكَّةَ عُمَىٍّ, (S,) or لَقِيتهُ صَكَّةَ عُمَىٍّ, and
↓ عُمْىٍ, which occurs in poetry, (K, TA,) in a
case in which the metre requires it, a verse of
Ru-beh, who uses it for عَمَىٍّ, (TA, [which
shows, by citing that verse, that عَمًى, the reading in the CK, is wrong,]) and ↓ أَعْمَى, (K,) i. e.
[I came to him, or I met him,] in the time of
midday when the heat was vehement, (S,) or in
the most vehement heat of midday in summer (K,
and Lh and O and TA in art. صك) when the heat
almost blinded by its vehemence; (Lh and O and
TA in that art.;) a time in which the divinelyappointed prayer [of midday] is forbidden: it is
said only in the hot season; because when a man
goes forth at that time, he cannot fill his eyes
with the light of the sun; or, as ISd says, because the gazelle seeks the covert when the heat
is vehement, and his eye becomes weak by reason
of the whiteness of the sun, and the bright shining
thereof, and he is dazzled, so that he knocks
against his covert, not seeing it: (TA:) عُمَىّ
being an abbreviated dim. of أَعْمَى: (S:) or it is
a name for the heat, (K, TA,) itself: (TA:) or
the name of a certain man, (K, TA,) of [the tribe
of] 'Adwán, who used to press forward with the
pilgrims when the heat was vehement, as is related in the Nh, or (TA) who used to decide
cases judicially in, or concerning, the pilgrimage,
and he came among a company journeying upon
their camels, (K, TA,) performing the religious
visit called عُمْرَة, (TA,) and they alighted at a
station in a hot day, whereupon he said, “Upon
whomsoever shall come this hour, or time, of tomorrow while he is حَرَام [i. e. in the condition of
one performing the acts of the حَجّ or of the عُمْرَة],
(K, TA,) not having accomplished his عُمْرَة, (TA,)
he shall remain حَرَام until [this time] next year: ”
and they immediately sprang up, (K, TA,) hastening, (TA,) so that they arrived at the House
[of God, at Mekkeh, in the time required,] from
a distance of a journey of two nights, using exertion; (K, TA;) and this saying became a prov.,
as is related in the M: (TA:) or it was the name
of a certain man, (S, K, TA,) of the Amalekites,
(S, TA,) who made a sudden attack upon a people, and exterminated them; (S, K, TA;) and
the time became called in relation to him. (S,
TA.) [See also art. صك.]

عَمَآءَةٌ.
عَمِيَّةٌ: see عَمَآءَةٌ, in two places. ―

(assumed tropical:)  Trial, or probation; punishment; slaughter;
civil war; conflict and faction, or sedition; &c.].
(Mz, 40th نوع.) [See also the next paragraph.]
―
-b2-  [In the TA, عمياء, evidently a mistranscription
for عِمِّيَّا, is expl. as having the second of the
meanings assigned above to عَمَآءَةٌ &c., i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Persistence; or contention, &c.] ―
-b3-  قَتِيلُ عِمِّيَّا, (Mz
ubi suprà, and K,) [in the CK, erroneously, عَمِيَّا,
and in the TA قُتِلَ عِمِّيَّا,] the latter word of the
measure فِعِّيلَى, (Mz, TA,) like رِمِّيَّا, (K, TA, [in
the CK like رَمِيَّا,]) and خِصِّيصَى, (TA,) means
(assumed tropical:)  A slain person whose slayer is not known. (Mz,
K, TA.) The predicament of him who has been
so slain is like that of the slain unintentionally;
the bloodwit being obligatory in his case [on his
عَاقِلَة, q. v. voce عَاقِلٌ]. (TA.)
عِمِّيَّةٌ and عُمِّيَّةٌ, (K, TA,) of the measure فُعِّيلَةٌ
from العَمَى, (TA,) Pride; or self-magnification:
or error; or deviation from that which is right.
(K, TA. [See also عَمَآءَةٌ, and عِمِّيَّا.]) Hence, in
a trad., مَنْ قُتِلَ تَحْتَ رَايَةِ عُِمِّيَّةٍ [Whoso has been
slain under a banner of pride, &c.,] i. e. in فِتْنَة
[meaning conflict and faction, or the like], or
error, as in the fighting in the case of partisanship, and of erroneous opinions. (TA.)
عَامٍ One who does not see his road, or way.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  عَامِيَةٌ, applied to a land (أَرْضٌ): see
أَعْمَى. ―
-b3-  Also, [thus applied,] Of which the
traces are becoming [or become] effaced, or obliterated. (TA.) ―
-b4-  See also أَعْمَآءٌ, in three places.
―
-b5-  Applied to a woman, (TA,) عَامِيَةٌ signifies
بَكَّآءَةٌ, (K, TA,) [a strange epithet,] meaning
(assumed tropical:)  Having very little milk. (TK.)
-A2-  Applied to
a man, عَامٍ signifies also رَامٍ [i. e. Casting, &c.].
(TA.)
أَعْمَى (S, Msb, K) and ↓ عَمٍ (K [but see what
follows]) Blind, (S, Msb, K,) of both eyes: (Msb,
K, * TA:) fem. of the former عَمْيَآءُ: (Msb, K,
TA:) and pl. [masc.] عُمْىٌ (S, Msb, K, TA, but
not in the CK) and عُمْيَانٌ (Msb, K, TA, but not
in the CK) and عُمَاةٌ, as though this last were pl.
of عَامٍ; (K, TA, but not in the CK;) and the
dual of its fem. is عَمْيَاوَانِ; and its pl. is عَمْيَاوَاتٌ:
(TA:) the fem. of ↓ عَمٍ is عَمِيَةٌ, (S, K, TA, [in
the CK عَمِيَّةٌ, which is a mistranscription, for it
is]) of the measure فَعِلَةٌ, (S,) like فَرِحَةٌ, (TA,)
and ↓ عَمْيَةٌ, (K, TA, but not in the CK,) which
is [a contraction] like فَخْذٌ for فَخِذٌ: (TA:) and
the pl. masc. is عَمُونَ. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  And [hence,]
(assumed tropical:)  Blind in respect of the mind: (K, TA:) [but
more commonly] one says, ↓ هُوَ عَمٍ as meaning
(tropical:)  He is erring, or one who errs; and أَعْمَى القَلْبِ
[meaning the same, or blind in respect of the
mind]: (Msb:) or القَلْبِ ↓ رَجُلٌ عَمِى i. e. (assumed tropical:)  An
ignorant man [or a man blind in respect of the
mind]; and اِمْرَأَةٌ عَمِيَةٌ عَنِ الصَّوَابِ [a woman
ignorant of, or blind to, that which is right], and
عَمِيَةُ القَلْبِ [like عَمِى القَلْبِ as applied to a man].
(S.) In the saying in the Kur [xvii. 74], وَمَنْ
كَانَ فِى هٰذِهِ فَهُوَ فِى الْآخِرَةِ أَعْمَى, accord.
to Er-Rághib, the former [اعمى] is a part. n.
and the second is like it; (TA;) and the meaning
is, And whoso is in this state of existence blind in
respect of the mind, not seeing his right course, he
will be in the other blind with respect to the way of
safety: (Bd:) or, as some say, the second is
what is termed أَفْعَلُ تَفْضِيلٍ, the complement of
which is expressed by means of مِنْ, [meaning
more blind &c.,] and therefore AA and Yaakoob
did not pronounce it with الإِمَالَة, as not being
like the first, (Bd, TA, *) which is subject to
الامالة because its ا [written ى] becomes [really]
ى in the dual: but Hamzeh and Ks and Aboo-Bekr pronounced both with الامالة. (Bd.) ―
-b3-
الأَعْمَيَانِ means (assumed tropical:)  The torrent and the fire of a
burning house or the like; (K, TA;) because of
the perplexity that befalls him whom they befall;
or because, when they occur, they spare not a
place, nor avoid anything; like the أَعْمَى [or
blind], who knows not where he is travelling, so
that he goes whither his leg conveys him: (TA:)
or the torrent and the night: (K:) or the torrent,
(S, K) or the tumultuous torrent, (TA,) and the
camel excited by lust. (S, K, TA.) ―
-b4-  And الأَمْرُ
الأَعْمَى (assumed tropical:)  The case [such as that] of partisanship
(العَصَبِيَّة) whereof the manner of proceeding is not
distinguishable. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And أَرْضٌ عَمْيَآءُ and
↓ عَامِيَةٌ, and مَكَانٌ أَعْمَى, (assumed tropical:)  A land, and a place,
in which one will not, or cannot, be directed to his
right course. (TA.) ―
-b6-  See also صَكَّةَ عُمَىٍّ: ―
-b7-
and see عَمِيَّةٌ.
أَعْمَآءٌ Tracts of land in which is no sign of the
way, (S, K,) nor any habitation or cultivation,
(K,) or nor any trace of habitation or cultivation;
(S;) and ↓ مَعَامٍ signifies the same; (S, K;) this
latter being a pl. of which the sing., said by ISd
to be unknown to him, should by rule be معمية
[app. مُعْمِيَةٌ], but it is ↓ عُمَّى, deviating from
rule; (TA;) or it means مَجَاهِلُ, and its sing.
is معماة [i. e. ↓ مَعْمَاةٌ] signifying a place of erring,
or wandering from the right way: (Har p. 85:)
in the K, أَعْمَآءٌ is also expl. as signifying جُهَّالٌ
[pl. of جَاهِلٌ], and is said to be [in this sense] pl.
of أَعْمَى: but this is a double mistake, for it signifies مَجَاهِلُ, [like as مَعَامٍ is said to do above,]
and its sing. is عمى [app. ↓ عَمًى]. (TA.) In
the phrase ↓ أَعْمَآءُ عَامِيَةٌ, [in the CK, erroneously,
عامِيَّةٌ,] the latter word is added to give intensiveness to the meaning; i. e., it signifies [Tracts in
which is no sign of the way, &c.,] in the utmost
degree obscure or dubious: thus it is in the following verse: (TA:) Ru-beh says,
أَعْمَاؤُهُ ↓ وَبَلَدٍ عَامِيَةٍ
كَأَنَّ لَوْنَ أَرْضِهِ سَمَاؤُهُ
[And many a desert, or waterless desert, whereof the
tracts in which is no sign of the way are in the utmost degree obscure or dubious, as though the colour
of its ground were like that of its sky]: (S, TA:) he
means وَرُبَّ بَلَدٍ. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also Tall; applied to
men: (IAar, K:) pl. of ↓ عَامٍ, like as أَنْصَارٌ is of
نَاصِرٌ. (IAar, TA.)
أَعْمَوِىٌّ Of, or relating to, such as is termed
أَعْمَى [q. v.]. (S, TA.)
مَعْمَاةٌ; and the pl. مَعَامٍ: see أَعْمَآءٌ.
مُعَمًّى (assumed tropical:)  A verse [or a saying] of which the
meaning is made unapparent, obscure, or covert.
(S, TA.)
المُعْتَمِى The lion. (K.)
