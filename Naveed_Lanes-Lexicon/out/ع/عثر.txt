(A, Msb, K;) and عَثِرَ, aor.
عَثَرَ; and عَثُرَ, aor.
عَثُرَ;
(A, K;) inf. n. عِثَارٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and
عَثْرٌ and عَثِيرٌ; (K;) said of a man and of a horse,
(S, Msb,) He stumbled, or tripped; [the most
usual meaning;] or he fell upon his face; syn.
كَبَا [which has both of these meanings]; as also
↓ تعثّر: (A, K:) or [simply] he fell; syn. سَقَطَ:
(Mgh:) or one says of a man, (Msb on the
authority of the Mukhtasar el-'Eyn, and TA on
the authority of the T,) عَثَرَ, (Msb, TA,) inf. n.
عُثُورٌ, (Msb,) or عَثْرَةٌ; (TA; [perhaps a mistranscription for عَثْرٌ;]) and of a horse, عَثَرَ, inf. n.
عِثَارٌ; (Msb, TA;) فِعَالٌ being a measure of
inf. ns. of verbs signifying various faults of
horses and the like. (TA.) You say, عَثَرَ فِى ثَوْبِهِ
[He stumbled, or tripped, upon his garment].
(S, O, Msb.) And فِى أَذْيَالِهِ ↓ خَرَجَ يَتَعَثَّرُ [He
went forth stumbling, or tripping, upon his skirts].
(A.) And عَثَرَ بِهِ فَرَسُهُ فَسَقَطَ [His horse stumbled,
or tripped, with him, and he fell]. (S, O.) And
it is said in a prov., الجَوَادُ قَدْ يَعْثُرُ [The swift
and excellent horse sometimes stumbles, or trips]:
applied to a person by whom a slip that is not of
his nature is seen to have been committed. (O.)
―
-b2-  [Hence,] عَثَرَ فِى كَلَامِهِ and ↓ تعثّر (tropical:)  [He
stumbled, or tripped, in his speech]. (A.) And
لِسَانُهُ ↓ تعثّر (tropical:)  His tongue halted, faltered, or
hesitated. (S, O, TA.) ―

-b4-  And عَثَرَ عَلَيْهِ,

عَثُرَ (S, O, Msb) and
عَثِرَ,
(TA,) inf. n. عَثْرٌ and عُثُورٌ, (O, Msb, K, [the

(tropical:)  [He stumbled on it; lighted on it by chance;]
he got, or obtained, knowledge of it; or sight and
knowledge of it; became acquainted with it; knew
it; or saw it; (S, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K, * TA;)
accidentally, or without seeking; (TA;) [and so
عَثَرَ بِهِ; (see an ex. voce أَشْرَسُ;)] and ↓ أَعْثَرَ
signifies the same; but accord. to the usage of
the Kur-án, you say أَعْثَرْتُ غَيْرِى: so in the
Kitáb el-Abniyeh of IKtt. (TA. [See 4.])
You say, عَثَرَ عَلَى سِرِّ الرَّجُلِ (tropical:)  He obtained knowledge of, or became acquainted with, the secret
of the man [accidentally]. (TA.) [Hence,]
فَإِنْ عُثِرَ عَلَى أَنَّهُمَا اسْتَحَقَّا إِثْمًا, in the Kur
[v. 106], means (tropical:)  But if it become known, or
seen, (Ksh, Mgh, O, Bd, Jel,) that they two
have done what has necessitated sin, (Ksh, Bd,
Jel,) and deserved its being said of them that they
were sinners. (Ksh.) And عَثَرَ, aor.
عَثُرَ, inf. n. عُثُورٌ,
as expl. by Lth, means (assumed tropical:)  He (a man) entered

to be overcome. (O.)

عَثَّرَ see the next paragraph, in three places.
4
اعثرهُ He caused him to stumble, or trip; or
to fall upon his face; [or simply, to fall;] as
also ↓ عثّرهُ; (K, TA;) [and so بِهِ ↓ عَثَرَ; (see 1,
last sentence, and see also عَاثُورٌ, first sentence;)]
said of God. (TA.) IAar cites as an ex.,
فَخَرَجْتُ أُعْثَرُ فِى مَقَادِمِ جُبَّتِى
لَوْلَا الحَيَآءُ أَطَرْتُهُ إِحْضَارَا
[And I went forth, made to stumble, or trip, upon
the fore parts of my jubbeh: but for the sense of
shame, I had made it to fly, in running]: accord.
to one relation, however, the verb in question,
in this verse, is أَعْثُرُ. (TA.) And اعثرهُ اللّٰهُ is
syn. with أَتْعَسَهُ [of which see various explanations in art. تعس]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] اعثر بِهِ
عِنْدَ السُّلْطَانِ, (K,) or عِنْدَهُ ↓ عثّرهُ, (A,) (tropical:)  He
impugned his character to the Sultán, (A, O, K,)
and sought to make him fall into destruction by
means of the latter. (A.) ―
-b3-  And اعثرهُ عَلَيْهِ
(tropical:)  [He made him to stumble upon it, or to light on
it by chance; or] he made him to get, or obtain,
knowledge of it, or sight and knowledge of it; to
become acquainted with it; to know it; or to see
it; (S, A, O, Msb, K; *) accidentally, or without
seeking. (B, TA.) Hence the phrase in the
Kur [xviii. 20] أَعْثَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ; (S, Ta;) in which
غَيْرَهُمْ, the objective complement, is suppressed.
(TA.) And اعثرهُ عَلَى أَصْحَابِهِ (tropical:)  He guided him,
or showed him the way, to his companions. (A.)
―
-b4-  اعثر جَدَّهُ, and ↓ عثّرهُ, (assumed tropical:)  He [i. e. God] made
his fortune, or good fortune, to fall. (K. [See
عَثَرَ جَدُّهُ.])

Q. Q. 1
عَثْيَرَ القَوْمُ [from عِثْيَرٌ] The people, or
party, raised the dust, or earth, or bits of dry
clay or compact earth, (termed عِثْيَر,) with the
extremities of their toes, in walking. (Kh, Har
p. 488.)
-A2-  عَيْثَرَ الطَّيْرَ [from عَيْثَرٌ] He saw, or
beheld, the birds: or he saw that the birds ran:
(O:) or he saw the birds running, and augured
from them (فَزَجَرَهَا). (K. [But this addition,
فزجرها, is evidently taken from an explanation of
the words here following.]) A poet says,
لَقَدْ عَيْثَرْتَ طَيْرَكَ لَوْ تَعِيفُ
[i. e. Thou sawest, or beheldest, thy birds; &c.:
would that thou wouldst augur from them, and
take warning]. (O.) And you say, عَيْثَرْتُ الشَّىْءَ
I saw, or beheld, the thing; (L, TA;) and individuated it. (TA.)
عَثْرٌ: see عَثَرِىٌّ.
عُثْرٌ A lie; or falsehood; (K;) as also ↓ عَثَرٌ.
(IAar, K.)
-A2-  Also The Eagle: (K:) a meaning
also assigned in the K, in art. عبر, but erroneously, to عُبْرٌ. (TA.)
عَثَرٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
عَثْرَةٌ A stumble, or trip, (Msb, TA,) in walking, or going along: pl. عَثَرَاتٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
[hence,] (tropical:)  A slip, lapse, fault, wrong action, or
mistake; (S, O, Msb, TA;) so called as being
a fall into sin or crime. (Msb.) One says,
أَقَالَ اللّٰهُ عَثْرَتَكَ (tropical:)  [May God cancel thy slip,
lapse, fault, &c.]. (A.) And it is said in a trad.,
لَا حَلِيمَ إِلَّا ذُو عَثْرَةٍ i. e. (tropical:)  There is no one to be
characterized as of a forbearing disposition except
he be one who has committed a slip, and becomes
admonished thereby, distinguishing the occasions
of error so as to avoid them [and to make
allowance for others who have done the like].
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  War, or fight, against unbelievers or others; because war, or fight, is an
occasion of frequent stumbling, or tripping: so
in a trad., in which it is said, لَا تَبْدَأْهُمْ بِالعَثْرَةِ
(assumed tropical:)  [Begin not ye with them by war]; meaning
invite ye them first to El-Islám or to the payment
of the poll-tax; and if they assent not, then have
recourse to war. (TA.)
عَثِرَةٌ Land (أَرْض) without herbage, being high,
and overspread with عِثْيَر, i. e. dust: (O, TA:)
and said to occur in a trad. as the name of a
particular land. (O, K, * TA.)
عَثَرِىٌّ i. q. عِذْىٌ, (Az, S, O, Msb, TA,) as some
say; (Msb;) i. e., (Az, S, O, TA,) Such as is
watered by the rain (Az, S, K, TA) alone, (S,)
of palm-trees, (Az, O, TA,) or of seed-produce:
(S:) or such as is watered by water running upon
the surface of the ground, (O, Msb,) of palmtrees: (Msb:) or seed-produce that is watered
by torrents and by rain, the water being made to
flow thereto in channels: (TA:) and ↓ عَثْرٌ
signifies the same: (K, TA:) or, accord. to
IAth, palm-trees (نَخِيل) that imbibe with their
roots of the rain-water that collects in a part
hollowed out in the ground: (TA:) the former
term is said to be thus applied because what is so
called is as though it stumbled upon water without
any labour of its owner; regarding it as an
irregular rel. n. from العَثْرُ: (O, * TA:) but Abu-l-'Abbás [i. e. Th] says that, thus applied, it is
with teshdeed to the ث [i. e. عَثَّرِىٌّ], though not
in the sense here following. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  A
man who does not occupy himself in seeking the
things of the present world nor those of the world
to come: (O, K, TA:) occurring in a trad., in
which such is said to be the most hateful of mankind to God: (O, TA:) in this sense, sometimes
written with teshdeed to the ث, (K, TA,) and
thus it is accord. to Sh (O, TA) and IAar;
(TA;) but correctly without teshdeed: (Th, K,
TA:) and said by some to be from عَثَرِىٌّ
applied to palm-trees. (O, * TA.) One says
also, جَآءَ فُلَانٌ عَثَرِيًّا, meaning (tropical:)  Such a one came
unoccupied. (O, TA.)
عَثَارٌ or عِثَارٌ: see عَاثُورٌ, in six places:
-A2-  and
for عِثَارٌ see also عِثْيَرٌ.
عَثُورٌ [Having a habit of stumbling or tripping,
or of falling:] that stumbles, or trips, and falls,
much or often. (Har p. 296.)
عِثْيَرٌ, (S, O, K,) not عَثْيَرٌ, for there is not in the
language any word of the measure فَعْيَلٌ, with
fet-h to the ف, except ضَهْيَدٌ, meaning “ hardy,
strong, or robust,” and this is [said to be] forged,
(S, O, [but see ضهيد,]) Dust, (MA, O, K,) syn.
غُبَارٌ, (O,) or عَجَاجٌ, and تُرَابٌ, (K,) and thus
↓ عِثْيَرَاتٌ is expl. by Sb; (TA;) or dust rising
or spreading; (S, MA; *) as also ↓ عِثْيَرَةٌ; (TA;)
and ↓ عِثَارٌ signifies the same. (MA.) ―
-b2-  And
Clay, or earth, (K, TA,) or dust, or bits of clay
or compact earth, (TA,) which one turns over
(K, TA) with the extremities of the feet (K) or of
the toes, in walking, or going along, no other
mark of the foot being seen: (TA:) and an
obscure trace or mark, (K, TA,) said to be more
obscure than such as is termed أَثَرٌ: (TA:) and so
↓ عَيْثَرٌ, with the ى put before [the ث] and with
fet-h to the ع in both [of these senses: misunderstood by SM as meaning “ and with fet-h to the
ع in both words,” i. e. in عثير and عيثر]: (K:)
or ↓ عَيْثَرٌ signifies an obscure trace or mark:
(S:) and Yaakoob mentions the saying مَا رَأَيْتُ
↓ لَهُ أَثَرًا وَلَا عَيْثَرًا and وَلَا عِثْيَرًا [app. meaning I
saw not any trace of him nor any obscure trace]:
(S, O:) or ولا عِثْيَرًا means, nor clay, or earth,
&c., turned over by the extremities of his feet:
(TA:) and it is said that ↓ ولا عَيْثَرًا means, nor
bodily form. (O.) And [it is said that] مَا لَهُ أَثَرٌ
وَلَا عِثْيَرٌ and ↓ ولا عَيْثَرٌ means He is not known to
be a pedestrian by the appearing of his foot-mark,
nor to be a horseman by his horse's raising the
dust. (TA.) [See also Har p. 488.]
عِثْيَرَةٌ, and its pl. عِثْيَرَاتٌ: see عِثْيَرٌ. ―
-b2-  One
says also أَرْضٌ عِثْيَرَةٌ, meaning A land in which is
much dust. (TA.)
عَاثِرٌ [Stumbling, or tripping; &c. ―
-b2-  And] (assumed tropical:)  A
liar. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And one says also جَدٌّ عَاثِرٌ
(assumed tropical:)  [Fortune, or good fortune, in a falling state:
(see 1, near the end:)] pl. عَوَاثِرُ: (TA:) ―
-b4-  or
this may be pl of عَاثِرٌ signifying The snare of a
sportsman: ―
-b5-  or it may be pl. of ↓ عَاثِرَةٌ signifying (assumed tropical:)  An accident that destroys, or causes to be
overcome, him whom it befalls: (O:) ―
-b6-  or it
may be pl. of عَاثُورٌ [q. v.], the ى being suppressed,
(O, TA,) by poetic license, in a verse in which
it occurs. (TA.)
عَيْثَرٌ The substance of a thing; its bodily, or
corporeal, form; syn. عَيْنٌ and شَخْصٌ. (T, O,
L, K, TA. [In this sense, it is said in the TA
to be erroneously written in all the copies of the
K عَثْيَر, with the ث before the ى; but I find it
written عَيْثَر in my MS. copy of the K and also
in the CK.]) See also عِثْيَرٌ, in five places.
عَاثِرَةٌ: see عَاثِرٌ.
عَاثُورٌ A pit dug for a lion or other [animal],
(S, A, O,) that he may fall into it, (A,) in
order that he may be taken: (S, O:) this is the
primary signification: (A:) or a thing that is
prepared for one to fall into it: (K:) or, as also
عثار [i. e. ↓ عَثَارٌ or ↓ عِثَارٌ (see what follows)], a
thing by which one is made to stumble and fall;
expl. by بِهِ ↓ مَا عُثِرَ: (TA:) the pl. is عَوَاثِيرُ;
whence, perhaps, عَوَاثِرُ, by suppression of the ى.
(O, TA. [See عَاثرٌ.]) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A place of
perdition: (TA voce حَاجُورٌ:) or (tropical:)  a cause, or
place, of perdition or of death: (A, K:) applied
to a land. (K.) You say, وَقَعَ فِى عَاثُورٍ (tropical:)  He
fell into a cause, or place, of perdition or of
death. (A, TA.) And فُلَانٌ يَقِى صَاحِبَهُ العَوَاثِرَ
(tropical:)  [Such a one preserves his companion from the
causes, or places, of perdition or of death]. (A.)
And it is said in a trad., إِنَّ قُرَيْشًا أَهْلُ أَمَانَةٍ مَنْ
بَغَاهَا العَوَاثِيرَ كَبَّهُ اللّٰهُ لِمَنْخِرَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily the tribe
of Kureysh are people of fidelity: whoso seeks for
them the causes, or places, of perdition or of
death, may God lay him prostrate upon his
nostrils]: or, accord. to one relation, عَوَاثِرَ. (O,
TA.) ―
-b3-  And [hence,] (tropical:)  Difficulty, or distress;
as also عَاثُورُ شَرٍّ: (S, O:) and evil; (K, TA;)
like عَاذُورٌ, which is a dial. var. thereof, or an
instance of mispronunciation; (S and O in art.
عذر;) as also ↓ عَثَارٌ, (accord. to some copies of
the K,) or ↓ عِثَارٌ: (thus in other copies of the K
and in the TA [in the latter of which it is said to
be with kesr; and this I think to be the more
probably correct; originally an inf. n.]:) and
شَرٍّ ↓ عِثَارُ is said by Fr to signify the same as
عَاثُورُ شَرٍّ. (TA.) You say, لَقِيتُ مِنْهُ عَاثُورًا,
(As, S, O, TA,) and ↓ عِثَارًا, (TA,) (tropical:)  I experienced from him, or it, difficulty, or distress. (As,
S, O, TA.) And وَقَعُوا فِى عَاثُورِ شَرٍّ, (As, S, O,
TA,) and عَافُورِ شَرٍّ, (S, O,) (tropical:)  They fell into difficulty, or distress: (As, S, O:) or into a confusion of evil and difficulty or distress. (TA.)
It is the opinion of Yaakoob that the ف in عَافُور
is a substitute for the ث in عَاثُور: but Az
observes that this is not necessarily the case, as
the meaning of difficulty is implied in the root
عفر. (TA.) ―
-b4-  It is said to signify also A kind
of snare (مِصْيَدَة) made of bark. (O.) ―
-b5-  And A
channel that is dug for the purpose of irrigating
thereby a palm-tree such as is termed بَعْلٌ. (O.)
―
-b6-  And A well. (K.)
-A2-  And it may also be
used as an epithet [app. meaning Perilous, or destructive]. (ISd, TA.)
