عَصَرَهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.
عَصِرَ, (O, Msb, K,)
inf. n. عَصْرٌ; (S, Msb;) and ↓ اعتصرهُ; (S, O,
Msb, K;) [He pressed it, or squeezed it, so as to

oil, water, or moisture;] he extracted, or fetched
out by labour or art [i. e. by pressure or wringing],
(Msb, K,) its water, or juice, or the like, (Msb,)
or what was in it, (K,) namely, what was in
grapes, (S, Msb, K,) and the like, (Msb, K,) of
things having oil, or sirup, or honey: (TA:) or
عَصَرَهُ signifies he performed that act himself;
(K;) as also ↓ عصّرهُ, inf. n. تَعْصِيرٌ: (Sgh, TA:)
or the latter, he superintended the pressing thereof,
i. e., of grapes: (O:) and ↓ اعتصرهُ, he had it
done for him: (K:) or this last, he did it for
another, or others: (Mgh, as implied by an
explanation of مُعْتَصِرٌ:) and عَصِيرًا ↓ اعتصر he
prepared expressed juice or the like. (S, O.) [See
also 8 below.] عُصْرَ is used as a contraction of
عُصِرَ. (S, O.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] عَصَرَ الثَّوْبَ, inf. n. as
above, He wrung out the water of the garment,
or piece of cloth; he forced out its water by
wringing it. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  And عَصَرَ الدُّمَّلَ لِتَخْرُجَ
مِدَّتُهُ [He squeezed, or pressed, the pustule in order
that its thick purulent matter might come forth].
(Msb.) ―
-b4-  And عَصَرَ حَلْقَهُ [He squeezed his
throat]. (Mgh and Msb in art. خنق.) ―
-b5-  And
عَصَرَ, aor.
عَصِرَ, (assumed tropical:)  He took, or collected, the produce
of the earth: from the same verb in the first of
the senses expl. above: and hence, accord. to Abu-l-Ghowth, in the Kur [xii. 49], وَفَيهِ يَعْصِرُونَ
(assumed tropical:)  And in it they shall take, or collect, the produce
of the earth: (S:) or the meaning is, and in it
they shall press grapes, or olives, or the like: or
they shall milk the udders. (Bd.) [And there
are other explanations, which see below.]
-A2-
عُصِرُوا, (S, IKtt, O,) or ↓ أُعْصِرُوا, (O, K,) They
were rained upon; they had rain; syn. مُطِرُوا,
(S, O,) or أُمْطِرُوا [which is less correct]. (IKtt,
K.) Hence, in the Kur [ubi suprà], accord. to
one reading, وَفِيهِ يُعْصَرُونَ [And in it they shall
have rain]. (S, O.) [See also above, and below.]
-A3-  عَصَرَهُ also signifies He saved him; preserved
him: and hence, in the Kur [ubi suprà], accord.
to one reading, وَفِيهِ يُعْصَرُونَ [And in it they shall
be saved, or preserved]. (Bd.) ―
-b2-  Hence also,
perhaps, the other reading, وَفِيهِ يُعْصِرُونَ And in
it they shall aid, or succour, one another. (Bd.)
―
-b3-  See also 8, last quarter, in two places.
-A4-
Also, عَصَرَهُ, (O, TA,) inf. n. عَصْرٌ, (O, K, TA,)

(O, K, * TA:) one says, مَا عَصَرَكَ What withheld,
hindered, or prevented, thee? (O, TA.) And He

anything. (TA.) [See also 8, which signifies
the same.] ―
-b2-  And عَصَرَهُ, (K,) aor.
عَصِرَ, inf. n. عَصْرٌ,
He gave (O, K, TA) to him. (K, TA.) Thus
it has two contr. significations. (IKtt, TA.)
Tarafeh says,
لَوْ كَانَ فِى أَمْلَاكِنَا أَحَدٌ
يَعْصِرُ فِينَا كَالَّذِى تَعْصِرُ
(S, O, TA, but in the S with مَلِكٌ in the place of
أَحَدٌ,) i. e. [If there were, or would that there
were, among our kings one] giving to us the like
of what thou givest: (TA:) and another reading
is, مِثْلَ مَا تَعْصِرُ; (O;) and it is expl. (by A'Obeyd,
TA) as meaning, doing to us benefits (O, TA)
like as thou dost: (O:) but Aboo-Sa'eed relates
it thus;
يُعْصَرُ فِينَا كالَّذِى تُعْصَرُ
i. e. يُصَابُ مِنْهُ [app. from عَصَرَ signifying “ he
pressed ” grapes and the like; and thus meaning,
(assumed tropical:)  from whom is gotten, among us, like what is
gotten from thee; or, as it may be less freely
rendered, who has his bounty drawn forth, among
us, like as thou hast thine drawn forth]; and he
disallowed the reading [يَعْصِرُ and] تَعْصِرُ. (TA.)

app. from عَصَرٌ meaning “ a place of protection: ”
i. e. [the rudiments of its ears] became protected
in its glumes. (TA.)

عاصر فُلَانًا, inf. n. مُعَاصَرَةٌ and عِصَارٌ, He was
contemporary with such a one: or he attained to,
or reached, the time of such a one. (O, TA.)
Hence the saying, المُعَاصَرَةُ مُعَاسَرَةٌ وَالمُعَاصِرُ
لَا يُنَاصِرُ [The being contemporary is an occasion
of hard, or harsh, treatment; and the contemporary will not render reciprocal aid to his
fellow]. (TA. [But I have substituted معاسرة
for معاصرة, which latter seems to have been
written by mistake for the former.])

attained the عَصْر of her youth, (TA,) or [simply]
attained the period of her youth, (K,) and arrived

the time of puberty, and began to have the menstrual discharge; (S, O;) because of her womb's
being pressed; (O;) or as though she entered
upon the عَصْر of her youth: (S, O, TA:) or she
attained the age of puberty: (S, IKtt:) or she
had the menstrual discharge: (Msb:) or she
entered upon the time of that discharge: (K:) or
she approached that time; for, said of a girl, it
is like رَاهَقَ said of a boy; accord. to Abu-lGhowth el-Aarábee: (S:) or she approached the
age of twenty: (K:) or she became confined in
the house, (K,) and had a retreat (عَصَرٌ) appointed
for her, (TA,) at the time of her having the menstrual discharge: (K:) or she brought forth;

throat. (S, O, K.) ―
-b4-  And اعتصر مَالَهُ (tropical:)  He extracted, or extorted, his property from his hand,
or possession: (S, Msb, TA:) from the same verb
as syn. with عَصَرَ expl. in the beginning of this
art.: (Msb:) he took forth his property for a
debt or for some other reason: (K, * TA:) and
اعتصر, (assumed tropical:)  he took; (K;) as also ↓ عَصَرَ, aor.
عَصِرَ:
(TA:) (assumed tropical:)  he took of, or from, a thing: (TA:)
(assumed tropical:)  he got, and took, of, or from, a thing: (S, as

to El-'Itreefee, (assumed tropical:)  he took the property of his son
for himself; or he suffered the property of his
son to remain in his (the latter's) possession: you
do not say اعتصر فُلَانٌ مَالَ فُلَانٍ [such a one took
for himself the property of such a one] unless he
be a relation to him: [you say so of a father:] and
of a boy you say, اعتصر مَالَ أَبِيهِ, meaning, (assumed tropical:)  he
took the property of his father. (TA.) [See
اعتسر.] And بِالمَالِ ↓ اعتصر العَصَّارُ [or المَالَ?

the inf. n. is expl. by اِنْتِجَاعُ العَطِيَّةِ; but in the
L, the verb is expl. by اِرْتَجَعَ العَطِيَّةَ, [and in like
manner in the A and Mgh,] and رَجَعَ فِيهَا:
(TA:) (assumed tropical:)  he revoked, recalled, or retracted, the
gift; syn. اِرْتَجَعَ, (Mgh, O,) and اِسْتَرَدَّ. (Mgh.)
Hence the trad. of 'Omar, الوَالِدُ يَعْتَصِرُ وَلَدَهُ فِيمَا
أَعْطَاهُ وَلَيْسَ لِلْوَلَدِ أَنْ يَعْتَصِرَ مِنْ وَالِدِهِ, i. e., (tropical:)  The
father may take from his child what he has given
him; [but it is not for the child to take from his
father what he has given him.] (Mgh, O.) But
as to the trad. of Esh-Shaabee, يَعْتَصِرُ الوَالِدُ عَلَى
وَلَدِهِ فِى مَالِهِ [(tropical:)  The father may take back what
he has given to his child], the verb is made trans.
by means of على because it implies the meaning
of يَرْجِعُ عَلَيْهِ, and يَعُودُ عَلَيْهِ: (IAth, Mgh, O: *)
or this latter trad. means, the father may forbid
his child his property, and withhold it from him:
(S:) and [in like manner] the former trad., the
father may withhold his child from giving his
property, and forbid it to him: (TA:) for اعتصر
also signifies he prevented, hindered, withheld, or
refused; syn. مَنَعَ. (K, TA.) Hence, اِعْتِصَارُ
الصَّدَقَةِ [The withholding, or refusing, the poorrate]. (TA.) [See also 1.] ―

(tropical:)  He had recourse to him for refuge, protection,
or preservation; (S, A, K;) and sought, desired,
or asked, aid, or succour, of him. (A.) In the
Kur [xii. 49], ↓ وَفِيهِ تُعْصَرُونَ [sic], which is one
reading, is expl. by Lth as signifying And in it ye
shall have recourse for refuge, or protection;
but Az disapproves of this: (TA:) [the common reading] وفيه يَعْصِرُونَ, accord. to AO, (so
in one copy of the S,) or A'Obeyd, (as in another
copy of the S,) signifies and in it they shall be
safe; from عُصْرَةٌ signifying “ a cause, or means,
of safety: ” (S:) or they shall be safe from trial, or
affliction, and shall preserve themselves by plenty,
or fruitfulness. (TA.)

time, during which peoples pass away and become
extinct; (Esh-Shiháb, in the “ Sharh esh-Shifè; ”)
[a succession of ages:] such is said by Fr to be
its meaning in the Kur ciii. l: (TA:) pl. (of
pauc., O) أَعْصُرٌ (O, K) and أَعْصَارٌ; (K;) and [of
mult.] عُصُورٌ (S, O, K) and عُصُرٌ. (K.) You say,
مَا فَعَلْتُهُ عَصْرًا, and بِعَصْرٍ, I did it not in its time.
(A.) And ↓ جَآءُ لٰكِنَّ لَمْ يَجِئْ لِعُصْرٍ He came,
but he came not at the [proper] time of coming.
(AZ, O, K: but AZ relates it without لكنّ. TA.)
And ↓ نَامَ وَمَا نَامَ لِعُصْرٍ, (K,) or, accord. to AZ
and Sgh and the author of the L and others, ما
↓ نام عُصْرًا, (TA,) He slept, but hardly, or scarcely,
slept. (AZ, K, &c.) And نَامَ فُلَانٌ وَلَمْ يَنَمْ عَصْرًا,
and بِعَصْرٍ, Such a one slept, but slept not during a
[considerable period of] time, or day; (A;)
agreeably with other significations, here following. (TA.) ―

the morning, before, or after, sunrise; syn. غَدَاةٌ:

the day; until the sun becomes red; as also ↓ عَصَرٌ,
(IDrd, K.) Hence, العَصْرَانِ The night and the
day: (O, TA:) or night and day: (Msb:) and the
morning, before, or after, sunrise, and the afternoon
or evening; or the first part of the day and the last
part thereof: الغَدَاةُ وَالعَشِىُّ. (ISk, S, O, Msb.)
[See also الأَبْرَدَانِ.] A poet says,
وَأَمْطُلُهُ العَصْرَيْنِ حَتَّى يَمَلُّنِى
وَيَرْضَى بِنِصْفِ الدَّيْنِ وَالأَنْفُ رَاغِمُ
[And I put him off, delaying the payment of his
debt, morning and evening, or from morning to
evening, so that he loathes me, and is content with
half of the debt, though unwilling]: meaning,
when he comes to me in the first part of the day,
I promise to pay him in the last part of it: (ISk,
S:) or, accord. to Sgh, the right reading (instead of
والانف راغم) is فِى غَيْرِ نَائِلِ [without liberality]:
and the verse is by 'Abd-Allah Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr
El-Asadee. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Hence also (S, O) صَلَاةُ

of that object, added to the length of the shade
which the same object casts at noon; and accord.
to the Hanafees, when the shadow is equal to
twice the length of the object added to the length
of its mid-day shadow: its end being sunset, or
the time when the sun becomes red:] so called
because performed in one of the عَصْرَانِ, i. e., in
the last portion of the day: (O:) also called
الصَّلَاةُ الوَسْطَى [accord. to some], because it is
between the two prayers of the day [that of daybreak and that of noon] and the two prayers of
the night [that of sunset and that of nightfall]:
(Abu-l-'Abbás:) pl. [of pauc.] أَعْصُرٌ; and [of
mult.] عُصُورٌ. (Msb.) [And hence likewise,]
العَصْرَانِ is applied in a trad. to The prayer of daybreak and that of the عَصْر; one being made predominant over the other; (Msb, TA;) as is the
case in القَمَرَانِ applied to the sun and the moon;
(TA;) or they are so called because they are
performed at the two extremities of the عَصْرَانِ,
meaning the night and the day; (Msb, TA;)
