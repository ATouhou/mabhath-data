عد1
عَدَّهُ, (S, A, O, Msb, &c.,) aor.
عَدُ3َ, (O,
Msb,) inf. n. عَدٌّ (S, O, Msb, K) and عِدَّةٌ and
تَعْدَادٌ [which last has an intensive signification,
and may also be regarded as an inf. n. of the
verb next following]; and ↓ عدّدهُ; (TA;) or
this latter has an intensive signification; (Msb;)
He numbered, counted, reckoned, or computed, it:
(S, A, O, Msb, K:) [and ↓ اِعْتَدَّهُ sometimes
signifies the same, as is shown by what here
follows:] فَمَا لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِنْ عِدَّةٍ تَعْتَدُّونَهَا, in the
Kur xxxiii. 48, means [Then there shall not be
for you, as incumbent on them, any عِدَّة (q. v.)]
of which ye shall count the number [of the days]:
(Bd, Jel:) or the meaning is, of which ye shall
exact the accomplishment of the number [of the
days]: (Ksh, Bd:) and Lh has mentioned, as
heard from the Arabs, عَدَدْتُ الدَّرَاهِمَ أَفْرَادًا and
وِحَادًا [I counted the dirhems by single pieces],
and ↓ أَعْدَدْتُ, also, followed by the same words;
then adding, “I know not whether it [i. e. the
latter] be from العَدَدُ or from العُدَّةُ ” [i. e.
whether the meaning be I counted or I prepared
or provided, the latter of which is a well-known
meaning]: his doubt indicates that أَعْدَدْتُ is a
dial. var. of عَدَدْتُ; but [SM says] “ I know it
not.” (TA.) عَدَّ is doubly trans.: you say
عَدَدْتُكَ المَالَ as well as عَدَدْتُ لَكَ المَالَ [both
meaning I numbered, counted, reckoned, or computed, to thee the articles of property]. (TA.)
And you say, عُدَّ فِى قَوْمٍ He was numbered, or

former عَدٌّ, and of either تَعْدَادٌ, He enumerated,
or recounted, his good qualities or actions: a
phrase of frequent occurrence.] ―

counted, or reckoned, as meaning he accounted, or
esteemed, him, or it, good or bad &c.:] one says
عَدَّهُ حَسَنًا He counted, accounted, reckoned, or
esteemed, him, or it, good, or goodly; syn.
اِسْتَحْسَنَهُ: (S in art. حسن, &c.:) and ↓ اعتدّ
signifies the same as عَدَّ [in this sense]; whence
the saying,
وَيَعْتَدُّهُ قَوْمٌ كَثِيرٌ تِجَارَةً
[And many people count it, or reckon it, as merchandise]. (Har p. 127.)
2
عَدَّ3َ see above, in two places. ―
-b2-  عدّدهُ also
signifies He made it a provision against the
casualties of fortune: (S, O, K: see also 4:) so,
accord. to Akh, in the Kur civ. 2: or, as some
say, he made it numerous: (S, O:) or it may
mean he reckoned it (Bd and Jel in civ. 2) time
after time. (Bd.)
3
عَاْدَ3َ [عادّ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا, inf. n. مُعَادَّةٌ and عِدَادٌ,
app. signifies They enumerated, or recounted,
their good qualities or actions, one to another:
for] يَوْمُ العِدَادِ is expl. by Sh as meaning يَوْمُ
الفِخَارِ وَمُعَادَّةِ بَعْضِهِمْ بَعْضًا [i. e. The day of vying,

them equally in the thing: and عادّ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا

says, عادّهُ فِى المِيرَاثِ [He shared with him in
the inheritance]. (S.) ―
-b3-  [The inf. n.] عِدَادٌ also
signifies The contributing equally, or clubbing, for
the purchase of corn, or food, to eat: and a
people's having money, or property, divided into
lots, or portions, and distributed in shares among
them: syn. بِدَادٌ; (T and L in art. بد from
IAar, and O in the present art.;) and مُنَاهَدَةٌ.

prepared it, or provided it. (Msb, TA. *) One
says, اعدّهُ لِأَمْرِ كَذَا He made it ready, prepared

And أَعْدَدْتُ لِلْأَمْرِ عُدَّتَهُ [I made ready, prepared,
or provided, for the affair, its proper apparatus].
(TA.) Some say that أَعَدَّ is originally أَعْتَدَ;
but others deny this. (L in art. عتد.) See also
1, former half.
-A2-  أَعَدَّ is also intrans.: [but
when it is used as such, نَفْسَهُ may be considered
as understood after it:] see 10.
5
تَعَدَّ3َ [تعدّد It was, or became, numerous: often
used in this sense. ―
-b2-  Hence, one says,] هُمْ

thing. (TA.) See also 5. [And see 3.]
7
انعدّ: see what next follows.
8
اعتدّ It was, or became, numbered, counted,
reckoned, or computed. (S, O.) Many of the
learned say that ↓ انعدّ should not be [thus] used
as a quasi-pass. of عَدَّهُ: it is said to be vulgar,
or bad. (MF.)
-A2-  اعتدّهُ: see 1, first and last
sentences. ―
-b2-  One says also اعتدّ بِهِ (S, O, Msb)
meaning He included it in a numbering, or
reckoning. (Msb.) [And hence, He made account of it; accounted it a matter of importance.
And لَا يُعْتَدُّ بِهِ No account is made of it, or

of any account, or importance: a phrase of

Q. Q. 2
تَمَعْدَدَ, in which, accord. to Sb, the

measure تَمَلْعَلَ, but others contradict him, (S,
K, *) He assumed the dress, garb, habit, or
external appearance, of the sons of Ma'add who
was the son of 'Adnán, and who is called the
Father of the Arabs [because through him all
the descendants of Ismá'eel, or Ishmael, trace
their ancestry], (S, O, K,) imitating them in their
coarseness therein: (K:) or he asserted himself to
be related to them: (S, O, K:) or he spoke their
language: (TA:) or he affected, or constrained
himself, to endure with patience their mode of life:
(S, O, K:) or he imitated their mode of life,

manhood, and became thick, or coarse. (S, O,
K.) 'Omar said, (S, O,) or not 'Omar, but the
Prophet, (K,) اِخْشَوْشِنُوا وَتَمَعْدَدُوا, (S, O, * K, *)
i. e. [Lead ye a rough, or coarse, life, and]
imitate the mode of life of the sons of Ma'add,
&c. (TA.) [See also art. معد.] ―
-b2-  It is also

in the dial. of Temeem, much water; but in the
dial. of Bekr Ibn-Wáïl, little water: (AO, TA:)
or well-water, whether little or much; so accord.
to a woman of Kiláb; opposed to that of the rain:
accord. to Lth, a place which men make, or prepare, wherein much water collects; but Az says

O.) ―

tools, or the like, and of beasts: (L:) accord. to
some, formed from عُتْدَةٌ [q. v.]; but others deny
this: (L in art. عتد:) pl. عُدَدٌ. (Msb.) One says,
أَخَذَ لِلْأَمْرِ عُدَّتَهُ and عَتَادَهُ [He took, for the affair,
his apparatus, &c.; or he prepared, or provided,
himself for the affair]: both signify the same.

pregnancy; or [in the case of a widow not pregnant] four months and ten nights: (TA:) or the
woman's waiting the prescribed time after divorce,
or after the death of her husband, until she may
marry again: (Msb:) and the days of the
woman's mourning for a husband, and of abstaining from the wearing of ornaments &c.; (K, TA;)
whether it be a period of months or of menstruations, or the period completed by her giving birth
to offspring in her womb, which she has conceived
by her husband: (TA:) pl. عِدَدٌ. (Msb.) One
says, اِنْقَضَتْ عِدَّتُهَا Her عِدَّة ended, (S, TA,) from
the period of the death of her husband, or of his
divorcing her. (TA.) ―
-b4-  اِنْقَضَتْ عِدَّةُ الرَّجُلِ
means The man's term of life ended: pl. عِدَدٌ.
(TA.) ―
-b5-  And one says, فُلَانٌ إِنَّمَا يَأْتِى أَهْلَهُ
العِدَّةَ Such a one comes to his wife, or family,
only once in the month, or in the two months. (O,
L.) See also عِدَادٌ, in two places.
عَدَدٌ a subst. from عَدَّهُ “ he numbered it; ” as
also ↓ عَدِيدٌ: (S, O, K:) [originally] What is
numbered, counted, reckoned, or computed: (O,
Msb, K: [in the CK, a و is inadvertently omitted
after the explanation of this meaning:]) [and
hence,] a number; (Msb;) and ↓ عَدِيدٌ is syn.
therewith [in this sense, as will be seen in what
follows]; (A;) a quantity composed of units; and
therefore not [properly] applicable to one; but
accord. to the grammarians, one belongs to the
predicament ofالعَدَدُ because it is the root thereof,
and because it implies quantity, for when it is said
“ How many hast thou? ” it is as proper to answer
“ One ” as it is to answer “ Three ” &c.: (Msb:)
pl. أَعْدَادٌ. (TA.) ↓ مَا أَكْثَرَ عَدِيدَهُمْ means عَدَدَهُمْ
[i. e. How great is their number!]. (A.) Zj says
that عَدَدٌ is sometimes used in the sense of an
inf. n.; as in the phrase in the Kur [xviii. 10],
سِنِينَ عَدَدًا: but many say that it is in this instance
used in its proper sense, meaning مَعْدُودَةً [i. e.
numbered], and is made masc. because سِنِين is
syn. with أَعْوَام. (Msb.) In the phrase وَأَحْصَى
كُلَّ شَىْءٍ عَدَدًا, in the Kur [lxxii. last verse], it is
used in its proper sense of مَعْدُودًا, and is put in
the accus. case as a denotative of state; or it is
used in this case as an inf. n. (IAth, O.) ―
-b2-  It
signifies also The years of a man's life, which one
numbers, or counts. (IAar, O, K. [In the CK,
after the words وَالعَدَدُ المعدُودُ, a و should be
inserted.]) Hence the phrase رَقَّ عَدَدُهُ The years
of his life, which he numbered, became few, the
greater part having passed. (IAar, O.)
عِدَدٌ: see the next paragraph.
عِدَادٌ an inf. n. of 3 [q. v.]. (TA.) ―

(S, O, K) in this phrase. (S, O.) ―
-b4-  And i. q.
يَوْمُ العَرْضِ [which generally means The day of
the last judgment]. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And one says,
أَتَيْتُ فُلَانًا فِى يَوْمِ عِدَادٍ meaning I came to such
a one on a Friday (يوم حُمُعَةٍ), or on a Minor
Festival (يوم فِطْرٍ), or on a Great Festival (يوم

-b6-  And لَقِيتُ فُلَانًا عِدَادَ
الثُّرَيَّا, (S, O, K,) or عِدَادَ الثُّرَيَّا القَمَرَ, and فِى
نُزُولِ القَمَرِ الثُّرَيَّا, (TA,) meaning I met such
a one once in the month: (S, O, K:) because the
moon makes its abode in الثريّا [the Pleiades, its
third Mansion,] once in every month: (S, O:)
IB [understood the meaning to be, once in the
year; for he] asserts that, correctly, J should
have said, because the moon is in conjunction
with الثريّا once in every year, and that is on the
fifth day of [the Syrian month] Ádhár [corresponding to March O. S.], agreeably with what
is said in a verse of Ibn-Holáhil which will be
found cited in what follows: but [this verse evidently relates to what was the case in its author's
time; for it is well known that] the moon traverses
the firmament once in every month, and is every
night in a [different], Mansion, and it is therefore
in [the Mansion of] الثريّا once in every month.
(L, TA.) [Accord. to some,] one says, لَا آتِيكَ
إِلَّا عِدَادَ القَمَرِ الثُّرَيَّا, meaning I will not come to
thee save once in the year: because the moon
makes its abode in الثريّا but once in the year:
(A:) and مَا يَأْتِينَا فُلَانٌ إِلَّا عِدَادَ الثُّرَيَّا القَمَرَ, and
إِلَّا قِرَانَ القَمَرِ الثُّرَيَّا, meaning Such a one comes
not to us save once in the year: and مَا أَلْقَاهُ إِلَّا
الثُّرَيَّا القَمَرَ ↓ عِدَّةَ, and الّا عِدَادَ الثُّرَيَّا القَمَرَ, and
الّا عِدَادَ الثُّرَيَّا مِنَ القَمَرِ, meaning I do not meet
him save once in the year: (TA:) [but these
explanations are probably founded upon a want
of due consideration of a statement which here
follows:] after citing this verse of Aseed, or
Useyd, or Useiyid, [written in the TA اسيد,]
Ibn-Holáhil, or Ibn-El-Holáhil, [thus differently
written in different places,]
إِذَا مَا قَارَنَ القَمَرُ الثُّرَيَّا
لِثَالِثَةِ فَقَدْ ذَهَبَ الشِّتَآءُ
[When the moon is in conjunction with the Pleiades
in a third night, then winter has departed], AHeyth
said, [as though what was the case at a particular
period of a cycle were the case generally,] the
moon is in conjunction with الثريّا only in a third
night from the new moon, [meaning only once in
the year in the third night,] and that is in the
beginning of spring and the end of winter. (TA.)
―
-b7-  And عِدَادٌ and ↓ عِدَدٌ, (S, O, K,) the latter a
contraction of the former, used by poetic license,
(S, O,) signify A paroxysm of pain which a person stung or bitten by a venomous reptile suffers on
the completion of a year from the day on which
he was stung or bitten: (S, O, K: *) a paroxysm
of pain occurring at a certain period: (A:) a
paroxysm such as that of a tertian, or quartan,
fever; and the pain of poison which kills at a
certain period: and the regular period of the
return of a fever is called its عِدَاد. (TA.) One
says, أَتَتْهُ اللَّسْعَةُ لِعِدَادٍ The pain of the venomous
sting, or bite, returned to him with vehemence at
the expiration of a year. (S, O, * K.) And بِهِ
مَرَضٌ عِدَادٌ He has a malady that intermits and
returns. (A.) And عِدَادُ السَّلِيمِ is said to signify
A period of seven days from that on which the
person has received a venomous sting or bite:
when it has expired, his recovery is hoped for:
as long as it has not expired, one says, هُوَ فِى
عِدَادِهِ. (A, TA.) [See also 3.] ―
-b8-  عِدَادٌ signifies
also The time of death. (O, K.) ―

assemble together to wail for him. (ISk, TA.)

insanity or diabolical possession, that takes a man

عَدِيدٌ: see عَدَدٌ, in three places. ―
-b2-  Also A
man who introduces himself into a tribe, to be
numbered, or reckoned, as belonging to it, but has
no kindred in it: (Msb:) or عَدِيدٌ قَوْمٍ signifies
one who is numbered, or reckoned, among a people,
(K, TA,) but is not with them (معهم [app. a mistranscription for مِنْهُمْ of them]); as also ↓ عِدَادٌ.
(TA.) One says, فُلَانٌ عَدِيدُ بَنِى فُلَانٍ, (S, Mgh,
O, Msb,) and ↓ مِنْ عِدَادِهِمْ, (Msb,) Such a one
is numbered, or reckoned, among the sons of such
a one. (S, Mgh, O, Msb.) And فِى بَنِى ↓ عِدَادُهُ
فُلَانٍ He is numbered among the sons of such a
one in the دِيوَان [or register of soldiers or pensioners]. (S, O, K.) And أَهْلِ ↓ فُلَانٌ فِى عِدَادِ

And هُمْ عَدِيدُ الحَصَى وَالثَّرَى They are equal in
multitude, or quantity, to the pebbles and the moist

(TA.) The saying of Aboo-Duwád, describing a
mare,
وَطِمِرَّةٍ كَهِرَاوَةِ الأَعْزَابِ لَيْسَ لَهَا عَدَائِدْ
Th explains by saying that he likens her to the
staff of the wayfarer, because of her being smooth,
as though عدائد here meant knots: [so that, accord.
to him, we should render the verse thus: And
compact in make, or swift and excellent, like the
staff of those who go far away with their camels
to pasture, having no knots:] but Az says that
the meaning is, [like Hiráwet-el-Aazáb (a celebrated mare)], having no equals. (TA.)
-A2-  See
also عِدَادٌ, last sentence but one.
عَدِيدَةٌ A lot, portion, or share: (IAar, O, K:)
like غَدِيدَةٌ: (IAar, O:) pl. عَدَائِدُ; (IAar, O,
TA;) with which ↓ عِدَادٌ is syn.: and عَدَائِدُ

The portions of property and inheritance of the
sharers fly away in the course of time, two together and singly; but the lordship, or mastery,
is still remaining for the boy: (IAar, TA:) or
the poet means those who share with him [i. e.
with the boy] (مَنْ يُعَادُّهُ) in the inheritance: or
it (عدائد) is from عُدَّةُ المَالِ [i. e. what one prepares for a future time, of property]: (S, O:)
for عدائد, in this verse, some read غَدَائِدُ. (L in
art. غد [q. v.]) [See also زَعَامَةٌ.]
عِدَّانٌ and عَدَّانٌ The time, or period, of a thing;
(IAar, K, TA;) as in the phrase أَنَا عَلَى عَدَّانِ
ذٰلِكَ I was at the time, or period, of that; (IAar,
TA;) and in the saying جِئْتُ عَلَى عَدَّانِ تَفْعَلُ
ذٰلِكَ I came at the time of thy doing that; (TA;)
and thus in the saying كَانَ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى عَدَّانِ فُلَانٍ
That was in the time of such a one: (S, O:) or
the first, and best, or most excellent, part, (K,
TA,) and the most, (TA,) of a thing; (K, TA;)
accord. to Az, from أَعَدَّهُ “ he prepared it; ” and
so in the saying كَانَ ذٰلِكَ فِى عَدَّانِ شَبَابِهِ and
مُلْكِهِ [That was in the first and best and chief
part of his young manhood and of his dominion].
(TA.) [See also art. عدن.]
-A2-  عِدَّانٌ as a contraction of عِتْدَانٌ: see عَتُودٌ, of which it is a pl.
عَدْعَدَةٌ inf. n. of عَدْعَدَ [q. v.]. (IAar, O.)
-A2-
And The cry, or crying, of the sand-grouse
(القَطَا): (A 'Obeyd, O, K:) app. onomatopoetic.
(A 'Obeyd, O.)
جَيْشٌ أَعَدُّ An army in the most complete state
of preparation, or equipment. (TA, from a trad.)
مَعَدٌّ The side (ISd, TA) of a man and of a
horse &c.: (L in art. معد [in which it is fully
explained]:) المَعَدَّانِ signifies the places of the
two boards of the saddle (S, * O, * A, K, * TA)
upon the two sides of the horse. (A, TA.) One
says, عَرِقَ مَعَدَّاهُ [The parts of his sides beneath
the two boards of the saddle sweated]. (A, TA.)
اللِّبْسَةُ المَعَدِّيَّةُ The mode of dress of the sons of
Ma'add, which was coarse and rude. (S, from a
trad. [See Q. Q. 2.])
مَعْدُودٌ [meaning Numbered, counted, reckoned,
or computed,] is applied to any number, little or
large; but مَعْدُودَاتٌ more particularly denotes
few; and so does every pl. formed by the addition of ا and ت, as دُرَيْهِمَاتٌ and حَمَامَاتٌ;
though it is allowable to use such a pl. to denote
muchness. (Zj, TA.) الأَيَّامُ المَعْدُودَاتُ signifies
The days called أَيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ; (S, Mgh, O, Msb,
K;) the three days next after the day of the
sacrifice [which is the tenth of Dhu-l-Hijjeh];
thus called because they are few. (TA.) And
one also says دَرَاهِمُ مَعْدُودَةٌ [lit. Numbered, or
counted, dirhems] as meaning a few dirhems.
(TA.)
المُعَيْدِىُّ is the dim. of المَعَدِّىُّ, (S, O, K,)
meaning He whose origin is referred to Ma'add,
(S, O, TA,) and is originally المُعَيْدِدِىُّ, then
المُعَيْدِّىُّ, and then المُعَيْدِىُّ, (IDrst, TA,) thus
pronounced without the teshdeed of the د because
the double teshdeed, (IDrst, S, O, K, TA,) that
of the د with that of the ى after it, (IDrst, TA,)
is found difficult of pronunciation, (IDrst, S, O,
K, TA,) combined with the ى that denotes the
dim.: (S, O, K:) it is thus pronounced in the
prov., أَنْ تَسْمَعَ بِالْمُعَيْدِىِّ خَيْرٌ مِنْ أَنْ تَرَاهُ [Thy
hearing of the Mo'eydee is better than thy seeing
him]: (Ks, S, O:) or تَسْمَعُ بالمعيدىّ خير من
ان تراه, (K, TA,) which means the same, the ع
in تسمع being pronounced with damm because
أَنْ is suppressed before it; but some pronounce
it with nasb, regarding أَنْ as understood, though
this is anomalous: (TA:) or تَسْمَعُ بِالْمُعَيْدِىِّ لَا
أَنْ تَرَاهُ; as though meaning hear thou of the
Mo'eydee, but do not see him: (ISk, S, O, K:)
of which three variants, the second is that which
is best known: so says A 'Obeyd: (TA:) the
prov. is applied to him who is of good repute,
but whose outward appearance is contemned.
(S, O, K, TA. [See also Freytag's Arab. Prov.
i. 223.])
مُعْتَدٌّ بِهِ A thing included in a numbering, or
reckoning. (Msb.) [And hence, A thing of which
account is made; that is accounted a matter of
importance. See the verb.]
مُسْتَعِدَّاتٌ is used in a verse of Ibn-Mukbil as
meaning The legs of a she-camel. (AA, TA voce
أَطَامِيمُ, q. v.)
