كَأَنِّى كُنْتُ فِى الأُمَمِ الخَوَالِى
[(assumed tropical:)  And I have tried affairs, and they have tried
me, as though I were of the generations that have
passed away]; meaning, as though I were one of

-b3-  [Hence also,] one says, الثُّوْرُ

عَجَّمَ see 4.

عَاْجَمَ see the verse cited in the first paragraph.
4
اعجمهُ He made it (i. e. speech, or language,
S, K, or a thing, TA) to want, or be without, or
to have a quality the contrary of, clearness, perspicuousness, or distinctness; (S, Msb, K, * TA;)
or [to be barbarous, or vitious, i. e.] to want, or
be without, chasteness, or correctness. (K, * TA.)
Ru-beh says, [in some verses very differently cited
in different copies of the S,] of him who attempts
poetry without having knowledge thereof,
يُرِيدُ أَنْ يُعْرِبَهُ فَيُعْجِمُهْ
[He desires to make it clear, &c., and he makes
it to want clearness, &c.]. (S.) ―
-b2-  And He dotted
it, or pointed it, (S, K,) namely, a letter, (S,) or
a writing; (K;) he removed its عُجْمَة [or want
of clearness, &c.,] by means of dots, or [diacritical]
points, (Nh, Msb, TA,) and [the signs called]
شَكْل, [but see شكل,] which distinguished it,
namely, a letter, from other letters; the ا denoting
privation; (Msb;) as ISd holds to be the case;
(TA;) and so ↓ عجّمهُ, (S, * K,) inf. n. تَعْجِيمٌ;
(S;) and ↓ عَجَمَهُ, (K,) inf. n. عَجْمٌ; (S;) for
J's assertion [in the S] that one should not say
عَجَمْتُ is a mistake: (K:) this last verb, however, which J thus disallows, is disallowed also
by Th, in his Fs, and by most of the expositors
thereof; and J confined himself to the correct
and chaste. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And He locked it; namely,
a door. (Msb.) ―
-b4-  نَهَانَا النِّبِىُّ أَنْ نُعْجِمَ النَّوَى طَبْخًا
[The Prophet forbade us to make the date-stones to
become as though they were chewed and bitten],
(K,* TA,) occurring in a trad., means that when
dates are cooked for دِبْس, (K, TA,) i. e. for
taking their sweetness, (TA,) they should be
cooked gently, so that the cooking shall not
extend to the stones, (K, TA,) nor produce upon
them such an effect as that of their being chewed
and bitten, (TA,) and thus spoil the taste of the
حَلَاوَة, (K, TA,) so in the copies of the K, but
correctly, as in the Nh, the سُلَافَة [here meaning
the sweet decocture]; (TA;) or because they [the
date-stones] are food for the home-fed animals,
and therefore they should not be thoroughly
cooked, that their taste, (K, TA,) in the Nh
their strength, (TA,) may not go away: (K,
TA:) or the meaning is, [that he forbade] the
cooking the date-stones immoderately, so that
they would crumble, and their strength, with
which they would be good for the sheep, or goats,
would be spoiled. (TA.)

إِنْعَجَمَ see the next paragraph.

استعجم He was unable to speak: (TA:)
he was silent, mute, or speechless; (K, TA;) said
of a man. (TA.) And اِسْتَعْجَمَتِ الدَّارُ عَنْ جَوَابِ
سَائِلِهَا [The dwelling kept silence from replying to
its interrogator]: and Imra-el-Keys says,
صَمَّ صَدَاهَا وَعَفَا رَسْمُهَا
وَاسْتَعْجَمَتْ عَنْ مَنْطِقِ السَّائِلِ
[Its echo has become dumb, and its trace has
become effaced, and it has become in the state of
keeping silence from answering the speech of the
interrogator]: he makes استعجمت trans. by
means of عن because it is used in the sense of
سَكَتَتْ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  One says also, استعجم عَلَيْهِ
الكَلَامُ, (S,) or عَلَيْنَا, (Msb,) meaning Speech was
as though it were closed against him, or us; or he,
or we, became impeded in speech, unable to speak,
or tongue-tied; syn. اِسْتَبْهَمَ: (S, Msb:) and
عليه الكلام ↓ انعجم; [which means the same;]
syn. اِنْطَبَقَ and اِنْغَلَقَ. (K * and TA in art. طبق.)
And accord. to the K, one says, استعجم القِرَآءَةَ,
meaning He was unable to perform [or continue]
the recitation, or reading, by reason of the overcoming of drowsiness: but what is said in the Nh
and other works is اِسْتَعْحَمَتْ عَلَيْهِ قِرَآءَتُهُ i. e.
His recitation, or reading, was cut short, and he
was unable to perform [or continue] it, by reason
of drowsiness: and it is also expl. as meaning he
was, or became, impeded in his recitation, or
reading, and unable to perform [or continue] it,
as though he became one in whom was عُجْمَة.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And استعجم الخَبَرُ means The information, or narration, was dubious, confused,
vague, or difficult to be understood or expressed;
or was not to be understood or expressed; as
though it were closed [against the hearer or

art. بهم.)
عَجْمٌ The young of camels; (S, Msb, K, TA;)
such as the بَنَات لَبُون and حِقَاق and جِذَاع:

are of the جِلَّة thereof: (IAar, TA:) applied to
the male and to the female: (S, Msb, K:) pl.

↓ عُجْمٌ; (K;) like عَجْبٌ [and عُجْبٌ]; (S, Msb;)
[each] a dial. var. of عجب; (Msb;) or, accord.
to Lh, the م is a substitute for the ب of عجب.

-A4-  [Golius and Freytag
have assigned to this word a meaning belonging
to عَجْمِىٌّ.]
عُجْمٌ: see the next preceding paragraph:

and that here following.
عَجَمٌ [Foreigners, as meaning] others than
Arabs; such as are not Arabs; [often used as
implying disparagement, like barbarians; and

the race of the عَجَم; (K;) though he may be
chaste, or correct, in [the Arabic] speech; (Mgh,
K;) the ى denoting unity; but it is also the
relative ى, and thus one may apply to an Arab
the appellation ↓ عَجَمِىٌّ as meaning called thus in
relation to the عَجَم: (Msb:) and one says also
↓ رَجُلٌ أَعْجَمُ [a man not of the Arabs]: and

other things, (Msb,) or the similar stones of anything, (K,) or also whatever is in the interior of
a thing that is eaten such as the raisin and the
like; (S;) and ↓ عُجَامٌ signifies the same: (K:)
the vulgar say ↓ عَجْم: (Yaakoob, S:) [see also
غِيضٌ, in an explanation of which عَجَمٌ is evidently, I think, used as meaning the heart (commonly termed جُمَّار q. v.) of the palm-tree:] the
n. un. is عَجَمَةٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) which is incorrectly expl. by AHn as meaning a grape-stone
when it germinates. (ISd, TA.)

latter epithet is applied to a tongue, or speech,
and to a book, or writing, but not to a man
unless it be syn. with the former epithet: (S:)
the fem. of the former is عَجْمَآءُ: (S, Mgh, Msb:)

phrase signifies a she-camel such as, when tried,
is found to have strength for traversing the desert,
or waterless desert; and he says that it does not
mean in which is fatness. (TA.)
مُعْجَمٌ [pass. part. n. of 4: and also an inf. n.

letters of the dotted character]: (S:) or by
المُعْجَمِ is meant الإِعْجَامِ, it being an inf. n., like

meaning of حُرُوفُ المُعْجَمِ is [the letters] of which
a property is the being dotted: (S, K:) of which
explanations, the latter is held by Mbr and IB
and others to be the more correct. (L, TA.) ―
