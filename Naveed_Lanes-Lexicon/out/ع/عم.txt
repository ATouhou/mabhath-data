the only instance of a word of the measure أَفْعَل
denoting a plurality, unless it be a [coll.] gen. n.,
like أَرُوَى; and he cites as an ex. the phrase بَيْنَ
الأَعَمّ, occurring in a verse; but Fr is related to
have read بين الأَعُمِّ, with damm to the ع,
making it pl. of عَمٌّ, like as أَضْبٌّ is of ضَبٌّ.

عَمَّاهْ, with the ه of lamentation. (S.) And one says,
هُمَا ابْنَا عَمٍّ [meaning Each of them two is a son
of a paternal uncle of the other]; (S, IB, Msb,
K;) because each of them says to the other, يَا
ابْنَ عَمِّى; (IB;) and in like manner, ابْنَا خَالَةٍ;
(S, IB, Msb, K;) because each of them says to
the other, يَا ابْنَ جَالَتِى: (IB:) but one may not
say, ↓ هُمَا ابْنَا عَمَّةٍ, nor ابْنَا خَالٍ; (S, IB, Msb,
K;) because one of them says to the other, يَا ابْنَ
خَالِى, but the latter says to the former, يَا ابْنَ
عَمَّتِى. (IB.) And [عَمٌّ signifies also A paternal
great uncle, &c.: therefore] one says, هُمَا ابْنَا عَمٍّ
لَحًّا [They two are cousins on the father's side,
closely related]; and in like manner, ابْنَا خَالَةٍ
لَحًّا: but not لَحًّا ↓ ابْنَا عَمَّةٍ, nor ابْنَا خَالٍ لَحًّا:

(S, K, TA,) and is pl. of عَمِيمَةٌ [fem. of عَمِيمٌ].

Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr, on his mentioning Uheyhah Ibn-El-Juláh and the saying of his maternal uncles
respecting him, كُنَّا أَهْلَ ثُمِّهِ وَرُمِّهِ حَتَّى اسْتَوَى
عَلَى عُمُمِهِ [i. e. We were the masters of the
meaner and the better articles of his property until
he attained to man's estate, or to his completeness
of bodily growth, &c.]; (S;) [or] the meaning
is, his completeness of stature and of bones and of
limbs: (TA:) also pronounced with teshdeed [or
idghám, i. e. ↓ عُمِّهِ], for the sake of conformity
[with ثُمِّهِ and رُمِّهِ]; (S, TA;) and by some,

the masc. is ↓ أَعَمُّ: (K:) or عَمِيمَةٌ applied to a
woman, (S,) or to a girl, or young woman, (TA,)
signifies complete, or perfect, in stature and make,
(S, TA,) and tall: (TA:) pl. عُمٌّ, (K,) which is
applied to palm-trees (نَخِيلٌ) as meaning tall;
(S;) or, accord. to Lh, to a single palm-tree
(نَخْلَةٌ), and may be [thus, originally,] of the
measure فُعْلٌ, or of the measure فُعُلٌ, originally
عُمُمٌ: (TA:) ↓ يَعْمُومٌ, also, signifies tall, applied
to a plant, or herbage: (K:) and عَمِيمَةٌ applied
to a بَقَرَة [or beast of the bovine kind] signifies
complete, or perfect, in make. (TA.) ―

عِمَامَةٌ [A turban;] the thing that one winds
upon the head: (K:) pl. عمَائِمُ (S, Msb, K) and
↓ عِمَامٌ, (Lh, K,) the latter either a broken pl. of
عِمَامَةٌ or [a coll. gen. n., i. e.,] these two words are
of the class of طَلْحٌ and طَلْحَةٌ. (TA.) [On the
old Arab mode of disposing the turban, see
خِمَارٌ.] The عَمَائِم were the crowns of the Arabs.
(S, Msb.) أَرْخَى عِمَامَتَهُ [lit. He slackened, or
loosened, his turban,] means (assumed tropical:)  he became, or felt,
in a state of security, or safety, and at ease, or
in easy circumstances; (K, TA;) because a man
does not slacken, or loosen, his turban but in easy
circumstances. (TA.) ―

rel. n. of عَمٌّ; as though formed from عَمًى, or
عَمًا. (S.)
[
عَمَّا is for عَنْ مَا when not interrogative.]
عُمِّىٌّ, like قُمِّىٌّ, (K, TA,) with damm, but in
the M عم, (TA, [in which this word is thus
doubtfully written, and has been altered, perhaps
from عَمِّىٌّ, for قُمِّىٌّ is a word which I do not find
in any case other than this, and if any word of
the measure فُعْلِىٌّ were meant, أُمِّىٌّ would be a
much better instance of similarity of form,]) an
epithet applied to a man, i. q. عَامٌّ [app. meaning
Of the common sort; like عَامِّىٌّ]: (K, TA:) and
قُصْرِىٌّ or قَصْرِىٌّ, (accord. to different copies of
the K,) in the M قَصْرى, (TA, [there thus

-b3-  Also [A general word;
i. e.] a word applied by a single application to
many things, not restricted, including everything
to which it is applicable: the words “ by a single
application ” exclude the homonym, because this
is by several applications; and the saying “ to
many things ” excludes what is not applied to
many things, as زَيْدٌ, and عَمْرٌو: and the words
“ not restricted ” exclude the nouns of number,
for المِائِةُ, for instance, is applied by a single application to many things and includes everything
to which it is applicable, but the many things are
restricted: and the words “ including everything
to which it is applicable ” exclude the indeterminate plural, as in the phrase رَأَيْتُ رِجَالًا, all
men not being seen: and the word is either عامّ
by its form and its meaning, as الرِّجَالُ, or عامّ by
its meaning only, as الرَّهْطُ and القَوْمُ. (KT. [The
word in this sense is often used in the lexicons,
but is expl. in few of them, as being conventional
and post-classical.])

signifies The commonalty, or generality of people;

people; the common sort; or the vulgar]: (S,
Msb, K:) the ة is a corroborative: (Msb:) and
↓ المَعَمَّةُ signifies the same as العَامَّةُ: (IAar, TA
voce سَامٌّ:) the pl. of عَامَّةٌ is عَوَامُّ, (Msb,) and
↓ عَمَمٌ is quasi-pl. n. of عَامَّةٌ as contr. of خَاصَّةٌ.
(K.) [And one says also ↓ الخَاصُّ وَالعَامُّ as well
as الخَاصَّةُ وَالعَامَّةُ, meaning The distinguished and
the common people; the persons of distinction and
the vulgar. ―
-b2-  عَامَّةً means In common, or commonly, in general, or generally; and universally.
And one says, جَاؤُوا عَامَّةً meaning They came
generally, or universally.] عَامَّةُ الشَّهْرِ means The

And عَامَّةُ النَّهَارِ means The whole of the day. (TA
in art. ادم.) ―
-b3-  And العَامَّةُ signifies also General,

many and generous, (S,) paternal and maternal
uncles; (T, S, L;) and both are sometimes pronounced with kesr [to the ع of the former and to
the و of the latter, i. e. مُخْوِلٌ ↓ مُعِمٌّ: see مُخْوَلٌ
in its proper art.]: (S:) or مُعَمٌّ and ↓ مِعَمٌّ, with
damm to the [initial] م and with kesr to the
same, [but the latter is app. a mistake, occasioned
by a misunderstanding of what is said in the S,]
signify having many paternal uncles: or having
generous paternal uncles. (K.)
مُعِمٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.
مِعَمٌّ, with kesr to the first letter, (K, TA, [in
the CK, مِعَمُّ خَيْرِ بكَسْرِ اَوَّلِهِ is erroneously put for

good, (K, TA,) who includes mankind in common,
in general, or universally, within the compass of
his goodness, (Kr, T, K, TA,) and his superabundant bounty; (T, TA;) and ↓ عَمَمٌ signifies

voce مِثَمٌّ, in art. ثم:] مِعَمٌّ is almost the only
