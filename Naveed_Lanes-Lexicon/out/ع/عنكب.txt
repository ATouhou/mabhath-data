عنكبعَنْكَبٌ: see عَنْكَبُوتٌ, in two places.
عَنْكَبَاةٌ and عَنْكَبَآءُ: see the next paragraph.
عَنْكَبُوتٌ; (S, O, K;) generally fem., (S, O,)
but sometimes masc.; (O, K;) also, fem., عَكْنَبَاةٌ,
(S, O, K,) in the dial. of El-Yemen, with the ك
put before the ن; (TA;) and ↓ عَنْكَبَاةٌ and عَنْكَبُوهٌ
(so in the O and TA, but in the CK and a MS.
copy of the K عَنْكَبُوةٌ); and ↓ عَنْكَبَاءُ; (O, K;) the
last mentioned by Sb as shewing the ت in عنكبوت
to be an augmentative letter; but it is doubtful
whether this be a sing., or a quasi-pl. n.: (TA:)
also, masc., ↓ عَنْكَبٌ; (IAar, O, K;) fem., عَنْكَبَةٌ:
(IAar, K:) or the former of these two words is
a coll. gen. n. [and the latter, its n. un.]: (TA:)
[The spider;] the thing that weaves; (S, O;) an
insect that weaves a delicate web in the air and
upon the upper part of a well: (TA:) pl. عَنَاكِبُ
(S, O, K) and عَنْكَبُوتَاتٌ (K) and عَنَاكِيبُ (Lh,
TA) and عَنَاكبِيتُ, (As, Ktr, TA,) which last is
anomalous, in its having four letters together after
its ا: dim. ↓ عُنَيْكِبٌ and ↓ عُنَيْكِيبٌ and ↓ عُنَيْكِبِيتٌ;
but this last is not approved: (TA:) quasi-pl.
nouns عِكَابٌ and عُكُبٌ and أَعْكُبٌ [in the CK
أَعْكَبٌ]. (K.) بَيْتُ العنكبوت [The spider's web]
is also called عَكْدَبَةٌ. (Fr, TA.) ―
-b2-  Sá'ideh-Ibn-Ju-eiyeh says,
مَقَتُّ نِسَآءً بِالْحِجَازِ صَوَالِحًا
↓ وَإِنَّا مَقَتْنَا كُلَّ سَوْدَآءَ عَنْكَبِ
[meaning I hated virtuous women in El-Hijáz;
and verily we hated every black, short woman:
for] here عنكب signifies short: (Skr, L:) or it
may be syn. with عَنْكَبُوتٌ, but be used as an
epithet, though a subst., because it implies blackness and shortness. (IJ, L.) ―
-b3-  زَهْرُ العَنْكَبُوتِ:
see رُتَيْلَآءُ. ―
-b4-  عنكبوت also signifies A worm, or
maggot, that is engendered in the honeycomb, and
spoils the honey. (AHn, L.) ―
-b5-  عنكبوت is mentioned in this art. agreeably with the rule of Sb;
when ن occupies the second place in a word, it is
not to be pronounced augmentative without proof:
but J and some others consider the ن augmentative, and mention the word in art. عكب. (TA.)
عُنَيْكِبٌ and عُنَيْكِيبٌ and عُنَيْكِبِيتٌ: see the next
preceding paragraph.
مُعَنْكَبُ القَرْنِ A he-goat having a horn curved
so as to resemble a ring. (Az, TA.)
