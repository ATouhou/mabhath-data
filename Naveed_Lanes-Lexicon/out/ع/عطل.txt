عطل1
عَطِلَتْ, [in my copy of the Msb said to be
of the class of قتل, perhaps a mistranscription for
قَبِلَ, but see what is said below of عَطَلَ as syn.
with بَطَلَ, from which it may be inferred that
عَطَلَتْ is correct in the sense here following as
well as عَطِلَتْ,] said of a woman, [aor.
عَطَلَ,] inf. n.
عَطَلٌ (S, O, K) and عُطُولٌ; (O, K;) and ↓ تعطّلت;
(S, O, K;) She had not upon her any women's
ornaments; (K, TA;) and wore not any ornature,
or decoration: (TA:) or her neck was destitute of
necklaces or the like; (S, O;) as also ↓ استعطلت:
(Har p. 268:) accord. to Er-Rághib, العَطَلُ signifies the being destitute of ornature, or decoration.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And sometimes العَطَلُ is used [for
العَطَلُ مِنْ شَىْءِ] as meaning The being destitute
of a thing; though primarily relating to women's
ornaments. (S, O.) One says, عَطِلَ مِنَ المَالِ He
(a man, O) was, or became, destitute [of property],
and مِنَ الأَدَبِ [of discipline, or good qualities and
attributes, of the mind, &c.]. (O, K.) ―

it signifies also The being destitute of occupation.
(Er-Rághib, TA.) One says, عَطَلَ الأَجِيرُ, aor.
عَطُلَ,
like بَطَلَ, aor.
عَطُلَ, in measure and in meaning [i. e.
The hired man was without occupation: though
it seems that in this sense also, accord. to general
usage, the verb is عَطِلَ, aor.
عَطَلَ]. (Msb. [See also 5.])
And عطلت الإِبِلُ The camels were without a pastor to tend them. (Msb. [The context there app.
indicates that the verb in this case, likewise, is
with fet-h to the ط; but I believe it to be more
correctly عَطِلَت.]) ―
-b4-  And عَطِلَ, (O, K,) with
kesr [to the ط], (O,) [i. e.] like فَرِحَ, (K,) signifies also He was, or became, large in the body.

above, I left the camels without a pastor to tend
them. (Msb.) وَإِذَا العِشَارُ عُطِّلَتْ, in the Kur
lxxxi. 4, means And when the pregnant camels
[ten months gone with young] shall be left without
a pastor, or without being milked [?]; (Jel;) by
reason of the terrors of the hour; (O;) i. e. by
men's having their minds occupied by the terrors
of the day of resurrection. (TA.) And عُطِّلَتْ
is said of lands of seed-produce as meaning They
were left uncultivated. (TA.) ―
-b5-  التَّعْطِيلُ signifies
also التَّفْرِيغُ [as meaning The making, or leaving,
vacant from any work, occupation, employment,
or use; free therefrom; unoccupied; or unemployed]. (S, O, K.) One says, عَطَّلْتُ الأَجِيرَ I
