عو1
عَوَى, aor. يَعْوِى, inf. n. عُوَآءٌ (S, K, TA)
and عَىٌّ and عَوَّةٌ (K, TA) and عَوْيَةٌ, with fet-h
and then sukoon, thus in the M, but in the copies
of the K عَوِيَّةٌ, (TA,) said of a dog, (S, CK, TA,)
and of a wolf, and of a jackal, (S, TA,) He cried,
or cried loudly: (S:) [meaning he howled:] he
twisted his muzzle, then uttered a cry: or he prolonged his cry, not doing so with clearness: and
↓ اعتوى signifies the same: (K, TA:) [in the
Ham p. 693, the former is expl. as signifying
نَبَحَ and صَاحَ; but] it is said that عَوَّةٌ signifies a
prolonged crying; and is not the same as نَبْحٌ
[which means “ a barking ”]. (TA.) It is said
in a prov. لَوْ لَكَ أَعْوِى مَا عَوَيْتُ [If to thee I were
howling, I had not howled]; (TA;) or لَوْ لَكَ
عَوَيْتُ لَمْ أَعْوِهْ, in which the ه may be the ه of
pausation, or it may be put by metonymy for the
inf. n. so that the meaning is لَمْ أَعْوِ العُوَآءَ:
(Meyd:) it originated from the fact that a man
used, [and still uses, as I have had occasion to
do,] when becoming benighted, in the desert, to
howl, in order that the dogs, if any person by
whose presence he might be cheered were near
him, might hear, and reply to him, and he might
be guided by their howling: so this man howled,
and the wolf came to him, whereupon he said
thus: it relates to the seeker of succour from
him who will not succour him. (Meyd, * TA.)
And it is said in a trad., كَأَنِّى أَسْمَعُ عُوَآءَ أَهْلِ
النَّارِ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [As though I heard] the crying or loud
crying [or howling] of the people of the fire [of
Hell]: (TA:) [for] عَوَىَ is used metaphorically
as meaning he suffered distress, and complained;
from the عُوَآء of the dog: (Har p. 634:) as IAth
says, it is more especially used in relation to the
wolf and the dog. (TA.) And one says of him
who is esteemed, or found to be, weak, مَا يَعْوِى
وَمَا يَنْبَحُ (assumed tropical:)  [He does not howl nor does he bark].
(Ham p. 693.) ―
-b2-  And عَوَى إِلَى الفِتْنَةِ means
(assumed tropical:)  He called (K, TA) people, or a party, (TA,)
[to conflict and faction, or the like;] عَوَى being
used in this sense by way of likening the person
who does so to a dog, or in contempt of him.
(Ham p. 693.) [See also 10.] ―
-b3-  عُوَآءٌ signifies
also The grumbling cry (رُغَآء) of a weak young
camel: used in this sense by a poet. (TA.) ―
-b4-
عُوَآءُ المُغْتَابِ; and the phrase عَوَى عَنِ الرَّجُلِ;
see in the next paragraph.
-A2-  عَوَى, (S, K, TA,)
inf. n. عَىٌّ, (S, TA,) He bent a thing; as also
↓ اعتوى; and likewise a bow; as also ↓ عوّى,
(K, TA,) inf. n. تَعْوِيَةٌ: (TA:) and (TA) he
twisted hair, and a rope; (S, TA;) as also ↓ عوّى,
inf. n. تَعْوِيَةٌ. (S.) One says also عَوَى العِمَامَةَ
عَيَّةً He twisted the turban with a single twisting.
(TA.) And عَوَيْتُ رَأْسَ النَّاقَةِ I turned the head
of the she-camel by means of the nose-rein. (S,
TA.) And القَوْمُ صُدُورَ رِكَابهِمْ ↓ عوّى and عَوَوْهَا
The party inclined the breasts of their camels that
they were riding. (TA.) And عَوَى البُرَةَ He
bent, or inclined, the nose-ring of the she-camel.
(K, * TA.) And النَّاقَةُ تَعْوِى بُرَتَهَا فِى سَيْرِهَا The
she-camel twists her nose-ring with her خِطَام [or
halter] in her going. (S, TA.) And عَوَاهُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ
He turned him from the thing. (TA.) And one
says of the man who possesses prudence, or discretion, and precaution, or good judgment, and
who is hardy, strong, or sturdy, ما ينهى ولا يعوى
[i. e. مَا يُنْهَى وَلَا يُعْوَى He is not forbidden nor is
he turned]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And عَوَى signifies also
He (a man) attained to the age of thirty years,
so that his arm, or hand, became strong, and he
twisted vehemently the arm, or hand, of another.
(ISd, K.)

عوّى عَنِ الرَّجُلِ, thus in the M, with tesh-deed in the case of عوى and also in the case of
كذب in the explanation; but in the K, ↓ عَوَى
[without teshdeed]; (TA;) (assumed tropical:)  He repelled from the
man, or defended him; syn. كَذَّبَ, and رَدَّ: (M,
K, TA:) in the S is said the like of what is said
in the M; عَوَّيْتُ عَنِ الرَّجُلِ being expl. in the S
as meaning (assumed tropical:)  I repelled from, or defended, the
man (كذّبت عنه), and replied against his backbiter or censurer (رَدَدْت عَلَى مُغْتَابِهِ): and in the
A, this phrase is said to be metaphorical, and
expl. as meaning (tropical:)  I repelled from the man the
clamouring [or, as we say, the barking] of the
backbiter or the censurer (المُغْتَابِ ↓ رَدَدْت عَنْهُ عُوَآءَ):
thus all these three are express authorities for the
teshdeed. (TA.) [Freytag has represented the
phrase in the S as agreeing with the reading
thereof in the K, and has strangely expl. the verb
with عن following it as meaning “ Mendacii
arguit et refellit.”]
-A2-  See also 1, latter half, in
three places.

عاوى الكِلَابَ He cried, or cried loudly,

حمى.) ―

of them, aid, or succour: (K, TA:) or, accord.
to the S, it means نَعَقَ بِهِمْ إِلَى الفِتْنَةِ [he urged
them by clamour, or shouting, to conflict and faction, or the like]: (TA: [in one of my copies of
the S, for إِذَا نَعَقَ بِهِمْ, the reading followed in the
JM and PS as well as in the TA, I find اذا
يُغْوِيهِمْ, which is app. a mistranscription: see

desired, or demanded, of them, that they should

عَا and عَوْ [in the CK عُو] and عَاىْ (K, TA)
and عَآءْ (TA) are Cries by which sheep are chidden.
(K, TA.)
عَوٌّ: see العَوَّآءُ, last sentence.
عَوَّةٌ [mentioned in the first sentence of this art.
as an inf. n.] A crying out, shouting, or clamouring; like ضَوَّةٌ: one says, سَمِعْتُ عَوَّةَ القَوْمِ i. e. [I
heard] the cries, or shouts, or clamour, of the
people, or party: so says AZ, and As says the
like. (S.) ―

عُوَّةٌ: see the next paragraph, last sentence.
العَوَّآءُ (S, K) and العَوَّا (K) The dog (S, K) that
howls (يَعْوِى) much. (S.) Hence the saying, عَلَيْهِ
العَفَأءُ وَالكَلْبُ العَوَّآءُ [Upon him be the dust, and the
howling dog]: a form of imprecation. (TA.) ―
-b2-
And the latter signifies also The wolf. (TA.) ―
-b3-
Also, both, (S, K, TA,) but the latter is the more
common, and its ا is to denote the fem. gender,
like that of حُبْلَى [in which it is written ى], the
word being fem., (TA,) (tropical:)  One of the Mansions of
the Moon, (S, K, TA,) namely, the Thirteenth;
(Kzw in his Descr. of the Mansions of the Moon;)
consisting of five stars, (S, K,) said to be the
haunch of the Lion [of which the Arabs, or some
of them, extended the figure (as they did also that
of the Scorpion) far beyond the limits that we
assign to it: see ذِرَاعٌ]: (S:) or four stars [g, d,
e and h, of Virgo], (K, and Kzw ubi suprà,)
behind الصَّرْفَة [q. v.], (Kzw ibid.,) resembling an
alif (K, Kzw) with the lower part turned back,
in the Koofee handwriting [in which it is nearly
like the Roman L (see زَاوِيَةٌ, in art. زوى)]; (Kzw
ibid;) also called عُرْقُوبُ الأَسَدِ; (TA, as from the
S, in my copies of which I do not find this;) they
regard it as dogs following the Lion; and some
say that it is the haunches of the Lion; (Kzw ubi
suprà;) accord. to the A, it is thus called because
it rises [a mistake for sets, aurorally, (see مَنَازِلُ
القَمَرِ, in art. نزل,)] in the tail, or latter part, of
the cold, as though it were howling (كَأَنَّهُ يَعْوِى)
after it, driving it away, wherefore they call it
طَارُودَةُ البَرْدِ: (TA:) or it is an appellation applied
by the Arabs to the star that is on the edge of the
left shoulder of Virgo, which is the Thirteenth
Mansion of the Moon: or, accord. to some, the
stars that are upon her belly and beneath her
armpit; as though they were dogs howling
(تَعْوِى) behind the Lion; so called because of the
vehemence of the cold; for when they rise or set
[aurorally], they bring cold. (Kzw in his Descr.
of Virgo.) And (assumed tropical:)  [The constellation Bootes;] a
northern constellation, called also الصَّيَّاحُ, consisting of two and twenty stars within the figure, and
one without it; the figure being that of a man
having in his right hand a staff, between the stars
of الفَكَّةُ and بَنَاتُ نَعْشٍ: the one that is without
the figure is a red, bright star, between his thighs,
[i. e. Arcturus,] called السِّمَاكُ الرَّامِحُ, and, by the
Arabs, حَارِسُ السَّمَآءِ and حَارِسُ الشَّمَالِ, because it
is always seen in the sky, not becoming concealed
beneath the rays of the sun. (Kzw in his Descr.
of the Northern Constellations.) ―
-b4-  Also, (K,)
or the former word, (TA,) [The aged she-camel;]
the نَاب of camels; (K, TA;) on the authority of
AA. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Also, both words, (K,) the former and sometimes the latter, (S,) the former said
by Az to be the more common, but MF says that
the latter is the more chaste, for the former was
by AAF absolutely disallowed, (TA,) The سَافِلَة,
(S,) or اِسْت, (K,) [each here app. meaning anus,]
of a human being; (S;) app. from عَوَى, aor.
يَعْوِى, signifying “ he cried,” or “ cried loudly:”
(TA:) as also ↓ عُوَّةٌ (IDrd, K, TA) and ↓ عَوَّةٌ,
(Lth, K, TA,) of which last the pl. is ↓ عَوٌّ [or
rather this is a coll. gen. n.] and [the pl. properly
so termed is] عَوَّاتٌ: but IAar is said to have expl.
العَوَّآءُ as meaning الأَسْتَاهُ [pl. of سَتَهٌ which is the
original of اِسْتٌ]. (TA.)
عَاوٍ [act. part. n. of عَوَى]. One says, مَا لَهُ عَاوٍ
وَلَا نَابِحٌ i. e. He has not belonging to him [a
howler nor a barker, meaning sheep, or goats,
among which the wolf howls and in the way to
which the dog barks [to defend them]. (TA.)
مُعَاوِيَةٌ A bitch excited by lust, (Lth, A, K, TA,)
that howls (تَعْوِى) to the dogs when she is in that
state, and to which they howl. (Lth, A, * TA.)
―
-b2-  And A fox's cub. (K.) ―
-b3-  And أَبُو مُعَاوِيَةَ is
a surname of The فَهْد [or lynx]. (K, TA.) ―
-b4-
The dim. of مُعَاوِيَةٌ is مُعَيَّةٌ; (S, K, TA;) thus
say the people of El-Basrah; for when three ى s
occur together and the first of them is the characteristic of the dim., one of them is suppressed [by
them]; (S, TA;) and مُعَيِّيَةٌ; (S, K, TA; [in the
CK مُعَيْيَةٌ;]) thus say the people of El-Koofeh,
not suppressing anything, after the manner of
those who say أُسَيِّدٌ; (S, TA;) and مُعَيْوِيَةٌ, (S,
K, TA, [in the CK مُعَيْوَةٌ,]) after the manner of
those who say أُسَيْوِدٌ. (S, TA.)
