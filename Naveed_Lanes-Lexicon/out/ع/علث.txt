علث1
عَلَثَهُ, aor.
عَلِثَ, (K,) inf. n. عَلْثٌ, (S, O,) to
which غَلْثٌ is like in its meanings (K and TA in
art. غلث) for the most part, (TA in that art.,)
He mixed it; (S, * O, * K, TA;) as also ↓ علّثهُ,
inf. n. تَعْلِيثٌ; and ↓ اعتلثهُ. (TA.) You say,
عَلَثْتُ البُرَّ بِالشَّعِيرِ, aor. as above, I mixed the
wheat with the barley. (S, O.) ―
-b2-  Also, (K, TA,)
aor. as above, (TA,) and so the inf. n., (O, TA,)
He collected it together, (O, * K, TA,) from different places. (TA.)
-A2-  عَلَثَ السِّقَآءَ He tanned
the [skin called] سقاء with the أرْطَى [q. v.], (K,)
or with any of the trees of the kind called عَلَث
[q. v.]: accord. to AHn, it is with غ [i. e. غَلَثَ].
(TA.) [But مَغْلُوثٌ, with غ, is expl. on the
authority of ISk, as meaning, applied to a سقاء,
“ Tanned with dry, or with unripe, dates. ”]
-A3-
عَلَثَ, (S, O, K, TA,) [or, perhaps, عَلِثَ, like
غَلِثَ,] as also ↓ اعتلث, (TA,) said of a زَنْد [or
piece of stick, or wood, for producing fire], It
failed to produce fire, (S, O, K, TA,) and was
difficult to use: and the subst. is ↓ عُلَاثٌ [app.
meaning The quality of failing to produce fire,
&c.]. (L, TA.)
-A4-  عَلَثٌ The fighting vehemently,
and cleaving to fight: (S, O, K:) and so غَلَثٌ.
(S, O.) One says, عَلِثَ القَوْمُ, aor.
عَلَثَ, inf. n.
عَلَثٌ, The people, or party, fought one another
[or did so vehemently and perseveringly]: and
عَلِثَ بَعْضُ القَوْمِ بِبَعْضٍ [One portion of the people,
or party, fought another portion vehemently and
perseveringly]. (TA.) And عَلِثَ الذِّئْبُ بِالغَنَمِ
The wolf kept to worrying the sheep or goats. (L.
[And so غَلِثَ.])
2
عَلَّثَ see 1, first sentence. ―
-b2-  [The inf. n.] تَعْلِيثٌ
also signifies Confusion of mind: or, as some
say, the beginning of pain. (TA. [See also 2 in
art. غلث; and see مُغَلِّثٌ, with غ.])
4
أَعْلَثَ see 8.
5
تعلّث He, or it, clung, clave, or held fast,
(O, K, TA,) بِهِ to it [or him]. (TK. [See also
5 in art. غلث.])
-A2-  Also He made, or did, [a
thing] faultily, or unsoundly. (O, K.) [Accord.
to the TK, one says, تعلّث السَّهْمَ, meaning He
made the arrow faultily, or unsoundly: but this
is perhaps a mistake: see 8.] ―
-b2-  And i. q. تَمَحَّلَ:
(K:) Fr says, تَعَلَّثْتُ لَهُ الذُّنُوبَ is like تَمَحَّلْتُ
[app. meaning I laboured, and exercised art or
management, in seeking to do to him misdeeds:
see art. محل]. (O.)
8
إِعْتَلَثَ see 1, first sentence. You say, اعتلث العُلَاثَةَ

(As, O.) ―
-b2-  And اعتلث زَنْدًا He took a زَنْد [or
piece of stick, or wood, for producing fire] from
trees, without knowing whether or not it would
produce fire: (S, O, K:) or he acted unskilfully
in selecting a زند: (A:) or he took, or made, for
himself a زند from any tree that he found in his
way: and so اغتلث, with غ. (AHn, TA.) And
one says, فُلَانٌ يَعْتَلِثُ الزِّنَادَ meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one
does not select his مَنْكِح [or wife]: (S, A, * O, K: *)
in which sense also يغتلث is a dial. var.: (TA:)
and in like manner one says اعتلث [alone], and
↓ أَعْلَثَ. (So in a copy of the A. [But I doubt
the correctness of the latter verb; and the more
so as it is not quite clear whether it be meant to
be expl. as having this meaning, or as meaning
It (a زَنْد) failed to produce fire, and therefore,
perhaps, a mistranscription for عَلَثَ.]) ―
-b3-  And
اعتلث السَّهْمَ He took [or made] the arrow from
any of the trees that were before him. (L.) And
He made the arrow faultily, or unsoundly. (L,
TA. [See also 5.])

طَرْفَآء and أَثْل [or أَسَل (see غَلَثٌ)] and حَاج and

أَغْلَاثٌ, which is somewhat similarly explained.])
―
-b4-  And A زَنْد [or piece of stick, or wood, for
producing fire] that has not produced fire. (A.)
And الأَعْلَاثُ [or أَعْلَاثُ الشَّجَرِ] signifies [also]
The promiscuous pieces of trees that one uses for
producing fire, of the [trees called] مَرْخ, and of
such as are dried up. (S, O, K.) ―
-b5-  And أَعْلَاثُ
الزَّادِ Such things as are eaten without being selected,

↓ مُعْتَلِثٌ. (O, K.)
-A2-  Also Firm, or constant,
in fight. (TA.) [رَجُلٌ عَلِثٌ is expl. in the O

cleaving, or holding fast, applied to such as is
seeking, or demanding, blood-revenge, or a debt
or the like; agreeably with what here immediately
precedes, and with the explanation in the L, which
is, مُلَازِمٌ أَىْ طَالِبٌ فِى قِتَالٍ أَوْ غَيْرِهِ cleaving, or
holding fast, i. e. seeking, or demanding, in fight
or in some other case. See عَلِثَ, of which عَلِثٌ
is the part. n.: and see also غَلثٌ.]
عُلْثَةٌ, with damm, (K, but written in the O
عَلْثَة,) i. q. عُلْقَةٌ [most probably, I think, in the
sense in which this is used in the phrase لِى فِى
هٰذَا المَالِ عُلْقَةٌ (q. v.), from تَعَلَّثَ in the first of
the senses assigned to it above, syn. with تَعَلَّقِ].
(O, K.)
عَلْثَى Food having poison mixed with it, by
which vultures are killed: mentioned by Kr: and

following paragraph.
مُعْتَلِثٌ: see عَلِثٌ: ―

-b3-  Also, (O, * L, [thus in the
latter, with kesr to the ل, but in the former without any vowel-sign to that letter, perhaps from
اِعْتَلَثَ الزَّنْدُ, but more probably ↓ مُعْتَلَثٌ, from
اعتلث السَّهْمَ,]) An arrow in which is no good.
(O, L.)
