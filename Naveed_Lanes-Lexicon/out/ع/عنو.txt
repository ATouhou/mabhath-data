عنو1
عَنَا, (S, Mgh, Msb,) first pers. عَنَوْتُ, (K,)
aor. يَعْنُو, (S, Msb,) inf. n. عُنُوٌّ, (S, Mgh, Msb,
K, *) and ↓ عَنْوَةٌ is the subst. thereof, (Mgh, K, *
TA,) [and] so is ↓ عَنَآءٌ, (Msb,) or عَنْوَةٌ is its
inf. n., (MA,) [and so, app., is عَنَآءٌ, in this sense
as well as in another sense, accord. to the K,]
He was, or became, lowly, humble, or submissive;
(S, MA, Mgh, Msb, K,) and obedient; (MA,
TA;) to the truth, &c. (TA.) You say, عَنَا لَهُ
He was, or became, lowly, humble, or submissive,
to him; or obedient to him. (MA.) And hence
the saying in the Kur [xx. 110], وَعَنَتِ الْوَجُوهُ
لِلْحَىِّ القَيُّومِ (S, TA) And the countenances shall
be lowly &c. [to the Deathless, or Ever-living, the
Self-subsisting by Whom all things subsist: or
shall be downcast; like the Hebr. phrases ending
verses 5 and 6 in Gen. iv.]: or shall be submissive
like captives: or the meaning is [shall be depressed
by] the depressing of the forehead and the knee [or
rather knees] and the hands in the lowering of the
head and the prostrating oneself [in prayer]: or
[عَنَت is here from عَنَى, belonging to art. عنى,
and الوجوه is used by a synecdoche for the persons
(as being the most noble of all the parts thereof),
and the meaning is] shall suffer fatigue, or weariness, and shall toil. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And عَنَا, inf. n. عُنُوٌّ
(M, Msb, K, TA, accord. to some copies of the
K [erroneously] عَنْوٌ) and عُنِىٌّ (TA) and عَنَآءٌ;
(K;) and عَنِىَ; (M, K;) He became a captive:
(K:) and the latter verb signifies also he stuck
fast in captivity: (K in art. عنى:) or both of
these verbs have this latter signification: (Msb:)
[or] you say, عَنَا فِيهِمْ فُلَانٌ أَسِيرًا Such a one remained among them a captive; and was in a
state of confinement: (S:) and عَنَآءٌ signifies also
confinement, or imprisonment, in hardship and
humiliation. (TA.) Hence the trad., الخَالُ وَارِثُ
مَنْ لَا وَارِثَ لَهُ يَفُكُّ عُنِيَّهُ i. e. أَسْرَهُ [The maternal
uncle is the heir of him who has no more nearlyallied heir: he shall loose his (the latter's) captivity]: meaning [he shall acquit him of] what
is incumbent on him, and clings to him, because
of the actions that require punishment or retaliation, the way [or custom] of which is that the
عَاقِلَة [q. v., of whom he is a member,] bear the
responsibility for them. (Nh, TA.) And ↓ عَنْوَةٌ
is the subst. of the verb in this sense also. (K, *
TA.)
-A2-  And عَنَا, aor. يَعْنُو, inf. n. عَنْوَةٌ, He took
a thing by force: ―
-b2-  and also he took it peaceably,
or by surrender: thus having two contr. significations. (Msb.) [But see below, where عَنْوَةٌ is
expl. as though it were the subst. of the verb in
these two senses.]
-A3-  عَنَوْتُ الشَّىْءَ I put forth,
or produced, the thing: and I made the thing
apparent, or showed it: (S:) or it has the latter
signification; (K;) as also عَنَيْتُ الشَّىْءَ: (IKtt,
TA in art. عنى:) and عَنَوْتُ بِالشَّىْءِ has the former
signification. (K.) And ↓ عَنْوَةٌ is the subst. of
the verb thus used, (K, TA,) i. e. in these two
senses, as well as in others mentioned above.
(TA.) And one says, عَنَتِ الأَرْضُ بِالنَّبَاتِ, (ISk,
S, and K in this art. and in art. عنى,) aor. تَعْنُو,
inf. n. عُنُوٌّ; (ISk, S;) and aor. تَعْنِى; (Ks, S;)
The land made apparent, or showed, [or put forth,
or produced,] its plants, or herbage; (S, K;) as
also ↓ أَعْنَتْهُ. (K.) And لَمْ تَعْنُ بِلَادُنَا بِشَىْءٍ and
لَمْ تَعْنِ Our country did not give growth to anything. (S.) And الأَرْضُ شَيْئًا ↓ مَا أَعْنَتِ The land
did not give growth, or has not given growth, to
anything. (S.) ―
-b2-  And [hence, app.,] سَأَلْتُهُ فَلَمْ
يَعْنُ لِى بِشَىْءٍ I asked him, and he did not (لَمْ يَنْدَ
and لَمْ يَبِضَّ) to me, or for me, anything. (TA.)
-A4-  عَنَتْ بِهِ أُمُورٌ Events befell him. (S, K.) [See
also 1 in art. عنى.] ―
-b2-  And عَنَا الأَمْرُ عَلَيْهِ The
event, or affair, was difficult, or distressing, to
him; distressed, or troubled, him. (ISd, K, TA.)
―
-b3-  عَنَاهُ الأَمْرُ, aor. يَعْنُوهُ: see 1 in art. عنى, first
sentence. ―
-b4-  And عَنَا فِيهِ الأكْلُ, aor. يَعْنُو, inf. n.
عُنُوٌّ: see 1 in art. عنى.
-A5-  عَنَا الكَلْبُ الشَّىْءَ, (CK,
[in the TA and in my MS. copy of the K للشىء,
but see what follows,]) aor. يَعْنُوهُ, inf. n. عنو [app.,
supposing the verb to be trans. by itself, عَنْوٌ],
(TA,) The dog came to the thing and smelt it:
(K, TA:) and one says, هٰذَا يَعْنُو هٰذَا This comes
to this and smells it. (TA.)

كَثِيرٍ, (K, TA,) aor. تَعْنُو, (TA,) The water-skin
did not keep, or retain, much water, so that it
appeared [oozing from it]: (K, TA:) or, as some
say, عَنَتِ القِرْبَةُ signifies the water-skin let flow its
water. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And عَنَا, inf. n. عُنوٌّ, said of
blood, It flowed. (IKtt, TA.)
-A7-  And عَنَا, aor.
يَعْنُو, inf. n. عُنُوٌّ, signifies also قَامَ [He, or it,

2
عنّاهُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. تَعْنِيَةٌ, (S, K,) He imprisoned him, or confined him, (S, K, TA,) long,
straitening him. (TA.) [See also 4.] ―
-b2-  And
تَعْنِيَةٌ is said to signify Any long confining or restraining: in a trad. of 'Alee, respecting the day
of Siffeen, he is related to have said, اِسْتَشْعِرُوا
الحَشْيَةَ وَعَنُّوا بِالأَصْوَاتِ i. e. [Make ye fear, or
awe, (app. of God,) to be the thing next your
hearts,] and restrain, and suppress, the voices; as
though he forbade their raising a confused and
unintelligible clamour. (TA.)
-A2-  عَنَّيْتُ البَعِيرَ,
(S,) inf. n. as above, (S, K,) I smeared the camel
with عَنِيَّة [q. v.]. (S, K.) [Hence تَعْنِيَةٌ as a

TA.) ―

as is termed عُشْب, [for قد اعشرت (to which I
cannot assign any apposite meaning) in my

pasturage had become abundant. (TA.)
-A3-  See
also Q. Q. 1.
5
تعنّى He [a camel] was, or became, smeared
with عَنِيَّة [q. v.]: whence the saying of EshShaabee, لَأَنْ أَتَعَنَّى بِعَنِيَّةٍ أَحَبُّ إِلَىَّ مِنْ أَنْ أَقُولَ
فِى مَسْأَلَةٍ بِرَأْيِى [Verily my being smeared with
عَنِيَّة would be more approvable to me than my
saying respecting a question according to my opinion]. (TA.)

an عُنْوَان [i. e. a superscription, or title,] to the
book, or writing; (K, TA;) syn. وَسَمْتُهُ: (TA:)
and one says also, الكِتَابَ ↓ عَنَا, aor. يَعْنُوهُ, meaning عَنْوَنَهُ; (IKtt, TA;) and ↓ اعناهُ and ↓ عنّاهُ
and عنّنهُ [which is said to be the original of عَنَّاهُ],
meaning the same; (K and TA in art. عنى;)
and عَنَيْتُ الكِتَابَ, inf. n. عَنْىٌ, likewise signifies
I wrote the عُنْيَان [or عُنْوَان] of the book, or
writing. (IKtt, TA in art. عنى.)
عِنًا: see the paragraph next following.
عِنْوٌ sing. of أَعْنَآءٌ as signifying The sides, regions, quarters, or tracts, (S, K,) of a country,
(S,) or of the sky; (K;) like أَحْنَآءٌ: (S in art.

the sides of the face. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And sing. of أَعْنَآءٌ
as signifying A party of men of sundry, or different, tribes. (S, K.)
عَنْوَةٌ Force, or constraint: (Mgh, K, TA:) or
the taking by force; (Msb, TA;) as inf. n. of
عَنَا [q. v.]. (Msb.) One says, فُتِحَتْ مَكَّةُ عَنْوَةً
Mekkeh was taken forcibly, or by force. (Mgh.)
And أَخَذَهُ عَنْوَةً He took it by force. (TA.) And
فُتِحَتْ هٰذِهِ المَدِينَةُ عَنْوَةً i. e. [This city was taken]
by means of conflict; its occupants having been
combated until they had it taken from them by
superior power or force, and were powerless to
keep it, so they left it without there having occurred between them and the Muslims [or invaders] a treaty of peace. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also Love,
or affection: (ISd, K, TA:) or submission, and
concession: or a consequence of submission and
concession, on the part of him from whom a thing
is taken: (TA:) or the taking peaceably, or by
surrender; as inf. n. of عَنَا [q. v.]: (Msb:) thus
it has two contr. significations. (Msb, K, TA.)
A poet (cited by Fr, TA) says,
فَمَا أَخَذُوهَا عَنْوَةً عَنْ مَوَدَّةٍ
وَلٰكِنَّ ضَرْبَ المَشْرَفِىِّ اسْتَقَالَهَا
(Msb, TA;) which is said to mean, [And they
did not take it, or her, or them,] by concession,
and obedience, [arising from love, or affection,]
without fighting: [but the smiting of the Mesh-rafee sword demanded the renouncing thereof:]
'Abd-El-Kádir Ibn-'Amr El-Baghdádee asserts
the meaning of عَنْوَةٌ to be submission and concession; adducing as evidence thereof this verse;
attributing the contr. meaning to the vulgar:
both, however, are correct; and that first mentioned occurs repeatedly in traditions: but the
most learned Yákoot Er-Roomee, in his Moajam,
says that the verse above-cited may be rendered
as meaning and they did not take it, or her, or
them, by superior power attended by [or in consequence of] love, or affection: but they did so by
fighting: and that this may be regarded as indicated by the poet's saying اخذوها; for otherwise
he would have said, فَمَا سَلَّمُوهَا: and he says, it
is a matter of common consent that عَنْوَةٌ signifies
force, and superior power. (TA.) ―
-b3-  It is also
a subst. from عَنَا in the first of senses mentioned
in this art.: [i. e. it signifies Lowliness, humility,
or submissiveness:] (Mgh, TA:) [and] so is ↓ عَنَآءٌ:
(Msb:) see 1, first sentence. ―
-b4-  And it is also a
subst. from عَنَا as meaning “ he became a captive: ” [i. e. it signifies also A state of captivity:]
(TA:) see, again, 1.
-A2-  And it is also a subst.
from عَنَا in two other senses, as stated above:
[i. e. it app. signifies also The act of putting
forth, or producing, a thing: and of making it
apparent, or showing, it:] (TA:) see, again, 1.
عُنْوَانٌ (S, K, TA) and عِنْوَانٌ (TA) The سِمَة
[meaning superscription, or title,] of a book, or
writing; (K, TA;) i. q. عُلْوَانٌ; (S;) and عُنْيَانٌ
signifies the same; (K in art. عنى;) as also
↓ مُعَنَّى: (K, TA: [in the CK, كَمَعْنَاهُ is put for
كَمُعَنَّاهُ:]) the inscription on the back, or outside,
of a book, or writing: (Har p. 163, in explanation of عُنْوَانٌ:) [and the address of a letter. And
hence,] Anything that serves as an indication of
another thing is called its عُنْوَان. (Msb and K

السَّجُودِ i. e. [On his forehead is] a mark [from
much prostration in prayer]. (TA.) [See more

is affected with mange, or scab, is smeared; on
the authority of AA: (S:) or certain mixtures of
urine and dung of camels, with which the camel
affected with mange, or scab, is smeared; also
termed ↓ تَعْنِيَةٌ: (K:) or the urine of camels that
are caused to void their urine [in my original
تُسْتَبَانُ is erroneously written for تُسْتَبَالُ] in the
[season called] رَبِيع when they are satisfied with
fresh pasture so as to be in no need of water,
cooked [app. by boiling] until it becomes thick,
when some flowers of some sorts of herbs, and حَبّ
المَحْلَب [the prunus mahaleb of Linn.], are
thrown upon it, and it becomes inspissated thereby,
then put into small [earthen vessels of the kind
called] بَسَاتِيق [pl. of بُسْتُوقَةٌ]: or urine [app. of
camels] mixed with certain things, and kept close
for some time: or any هِنَآء [generally meaning
tar, or a kind thereof, with which camels are
smeared, as a remedy for the mange, or scab].
(TA.) It is said in a prov., العَنِيَّةُ تَشْفِى الجَرَبَ;
(S, TA;) or عَنِيَّتُهُ تَشْفِى الجَرَبَ [for مِنَ الجَرَبِ,
i. e. His عنيّة cures the mange, or scab]: applied
to the man of good judgment [whose advice is
like a remedy]. (TA.)

TA:) pl. masc. عُنَاةٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb, TA;) and
pl. fem. عَوَانٍ. (S, Mgh, TA.) ―
-b3-  And عَوَانٍ signifies (assumed tropical:)  Women; (Msb, K;) sing. عَانِيَةٌ: (Msb:)
because they are confined like captives in the
abodes of their husbands; (Msb;) or because
they are treated wrongfully and not defended
against their wrongers. (K.) It occurs in a
trad. as meaning Females in the condition of
captives: (Mgh:) or women who are captives;
or like captives. (IAth, TA.) ―
-b4-  And it signifies
also عَوَامِلُ [which, as pl. of عَامِلَةٌ, is used as
meaning Workers, or labourers; and also, as a
subst., as meaning the legs of a beast or horse or
the like]: and it is said to be used by El-Jaadee
as an epithet applied to the limbs of camels, or
other beasts, used for riding. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And
hence, perhaps, it is applied to The مَكَّاسُون [or
collectors of the impost termed مَكْس, q. v.]; because they are workers, or labourers, for the
oppressors. (TA.)
-A2-  Also (the sing.) Flowing,

subst.,] see عَنِيَّةٌ.
مُعَنًّى A stallion [camel] of mean origin, which,
when excited by lust, is confined in the [enclosure
called] عُنَّة, because his exercise of the faculty of
a stallion is avoided: but it is said that it is
originally مُعَنَّنٌ, from العُنَّةُ; one of the ن being
changed into ى: (S, TA: *) or of mean origin,
of which the legs are bound with a rope, when he
is excited by lust, for that reason. (TA.) ―
-b2-
And A camel of which the people of the Time of
Ignorance used to displace the سَنَاسِن [pl. of سِنْسِنٌ,
q. v.] of one of his vertebræ, and to wound his
hump, in order that he might not be ridden, and
that no use might be made of his back: this was
done when his owner possessed a hundred camels,
he being the camel by which they became a hundred: and this act was termed الأِغْلَاقُ: it may
be from عَنَآءٌ meaning “ fatigue; ” or from the
signification of “ confinement from freedom of
action. ” (TA.)
-A2-  See also عُنْوَانٌ.
