TA,) which action is also termed مُعَايَرَةٌ [inf. n.
of ↓ عَايَرَ], (O,) as though he had made his escape
(K, TA) from his master, going to and fro:
(TA:) and the same is said of news: (IKtt,

away to others, (IKtt, L, K,) to cover them.
(IKtt, L.) In [some of] the copies of the K,
شَوْلَهَا is put in the place of شَوْلَهُ, which latter is
the reading in the Tahdheeb of IKtt [and in the
CK]. (TA.)
-A2-  عَارَهُ, aor. يَعِيرُهُ and يَعُورُهُ, (S and
K in art. عور,) or the aor. is not used, or it is
scarcely ever used, (TA in the same art.,) He, or
it, took, and went away with, him, or it: (S and
K in the same art.:) or destroyed him, or it. (K
and TA in the same art.) See art. عور. You say
عِرْتُ ثَوْبَهُ, I took, or went away with, his garment.
(TA.) And it is said in a prov., عَيْرٌ عَارَهُ وَتِدُهُ

vice, or fault, or the like. (S, O, TA.) [See also
what next follows.]
2
عيّرهُ كَذَا, (S, O, Msb, K,) and عيّره بِهِ,
though the former is the more approved, (ElMarzookee, in his Expos. of the Hamáseh, and
Msb, and MF,) or the latter is peculiar to the
vulgar, (S, and El-Hareeree in the Durrat el-Ghowwás.) and should not be used, (O, K,)
inf. n. تَعْيِيرٌ, (S, O,) He upbraided him with such
a thing; reproached him for it; declared it to be
bad, evil, abominable, or foal, and charged him
with it. (Msb.) [You also say عيّرهُ عَلَي فِعْلِهِ
He upbraided him, or reproached him, for his
deed.] And عيّر عَلَيْهِ [is an elliptical phrase, signifying the same; فِعْلَهُ or the like being understood: or He upbraided him; charged him with
acting disgracefully]. (TA, voce تعريب.) [See
also 1, last signification.]
-A2-  عيّر الدَّنَانِيرَ, (K,)
inf. n. as above, (TA,) He weighed the pieces of
gold one after another: (K:) and he put, or
threw down, the pieces of gold, one by one, and
compared them, one by one. (TA.) The verb is
[said to be] used in relation to measuring and
weighing; but, says Az, Lth makes a distinction
between عَايَرْتُ and عَيَّرْتُ, making the former to
relate to a measure of capacity, and the latter to
an instrument for weighing: and [SM adds,] F
mentions the former in art. عور, and the latter in
the present art. (TA.) See also 3, in five places.
-A3-  And عيّر المَآءُ The water became overspread
with [the green substance termed] طُحْلُب: (O,
K:) but [SM adds,] it is more probably أَغْثَرَ,
with ا and غ and ث. (TA.)
3
عاير المَكَايِيلَ, (S, Mgh, and K in art. عور,)
and المَوَازِينَ, (S, Mgh,) inf. n. عِيَارٌ; (S;) and
عاورها, (S, K,) and عوّرها; (K;) signify the same,
(S, K,) He measured, or compared, the measures
of capacity, (Mgh, K,) and the instruments for
weighing, one by, or with, another. (Mgh.) One
should not say ↓ عيّر. (S.) The saying اِسْتَعَارَ
?? ↓ دَرَاهِمَ لِيُعَيِّرَ, meaning, [He borrowed
pieces of money] that he might equalize [with them
the weights of his balance], should be, correctly,
لِيُعَايِرَ. (Mgh.) You say عَايَرْتُ المِكْيَالَ, and
المِيزَانَ, inf. n. مُعَايَرَةٌ and عِيَارٌ, meaning I tried,
or proved, the measure of capacity, and the instrument for weighing, [or gauged the former,]
that I might know its correctness [or incorrectness]:
this, says Az, is the correct form: one should not
say ↓ عَيَّرْتُ, except from العَارُ, accord. to the leading lexicologists and ISk says, عَايَرْتُ بَيْنَ
المِكْيَالَيْنِ signifies I tried, or proved, the two
measure of capacity, that I might know their
equality [or inequality]: you should not say
المِيزَانَيْنِ ↓ عَيَّرْتُ, (Msb.) [But in the TA,
الميزان ↓ عيّر and المكيال is mentioned without
any remark of disapproval, with عاورهما and
عايرهما.] You also say عاير بَيْنَهُمَا, inf. n. مُعَايَرَةٌ
and عِيَارٌ, He measured, or compared, them two.
each by, or with, the other, and examined what
[difference] was between them. (K in art. عور.)
―
-b2-  [Hence, عاير app. signifies also He assayed
gold &c.]
-A2-  See also 1, third sentence.
4
اعار الفَرَسَ, (S, K,) and الكَلْبَ, (K,) He (his
master) made the horse, and the dog, to go away
as though he had escaped, or got loose: (K:) or
made him to escape; (TA:) or made him to
escape, or get loose, and go away hither and
thither, by reason of his exceeding sprightliness.
(S.)
-A2-  أَعْيَرَ النَّصْلَ He made to the iron head or
blade of an arrow, or of a spear, or of a sword,
or of a knife, or the like, what is called عَيْرٌ. (AA,
K.)
-A3-  أَعَارَتْ حَافِرًا means She (a mare) raised
and shifted a hoof; ―
-b2-  and hence, accord. to Az,
إِعَارَةُ الثِّيَابِ [The lending of garments] &c. (L,
TA. [See 4 in art. عور.])
-A4-  And اعارهُ is also
said to signify He fattened him; namely, a horse:
―
-b2-  and He plucked out the hair of his tail; like
أَعْرَاهُ: both of which meanings are mentioned by
IKtt and others: ―
-b3-  and i. q. ضَمَّرَهُ [He made
him lean, or light of flesh, &c.]; from عَارَ “ he
went and came. ” (TA.)
5
هُمْ يَتَعَيَّرُونَ مِنْ جِيرَانِهِمُ الأَمْتِعَةَ is said to
mean يَسْتَعِيرُونَ [i. e. They ask of their neighbours the loan of the household-goods, &c.]: but
Az says that the word used by the Arabs is
يَتَعَيَّرُونَ. (TA. [See 10 in art. عور.])
6
تعايروا They blamed, upbraided, or reproached, one another; found fault, one with
another; i. q. تَعَايَبُوا, (S, O, Msb,) or عَيَّرَ بَعْضُهُمْ
بَعْضًا: (K:) or they reviled, or vilified, one another; syn. تَسَابُّوا. (AZ.)
10
استعار سَهْمًا مِنْ كِنَانَتِهِ: see art. عور.
عَارٌ A disgrace; a shame; a thing that occasions one's being reviled; a vice, or fault, or the
like; (S, O;) a thing for which one is, or is to
be, blamed, or dispraised; (B, in TA, art. عور;)
anything that necessarily occasions blame or reproach, (Msb, K,) or disgrace: (Msb:) pl. أَعْيَارٌ:
(TA:) and ↓ مَعَايِرُ, (S, O, K,) of which the sing.
is app. ↓ مَعْيَرَةٌ, (O,) [is syn. with أَعْيَارٌ, for it] signifies things for which one is, or is to be, blamed,
upbraided, reproached, or found fault with; syn.
مَعَايِبُ. (S, O, K.)
عَيْرٌ The ass; (S, O, Msb, K;) both the wild
and the domestic; (S, O, Msb;) its predominant
application is to the former: (K:) so called because he goes away hither and thither (يَعِيرُ
فَيَتَرَدَّدُ) in the desert: (TA:) fem. with ة: (S,
Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَعْيَارٌ, (S, O, Msb, K.) and
[of mult.] عِيَارٌ and عُيُورٌ (K) and عُيُورَةٌ (S, O,
Msb, K) and عِيَرَةٌ (O) and ↓ مَعْيُورَآءُ, (S, O, K,)
like مَشْيُوخَآءُ &c., or this is [properly speaking] a
quasi-pl. n., (TA,) and ↓ مَعْيُورَى, [also a quasipl. n.,] (Az, TA,) and pl. pl. عِيَرَاتٌ (O) and
عِيَارَاتٌ. (K.) [Dim. عُيَيْرٌ, q. v. intra.] ―
-b2-  It is
said in a prov., relating to contentment with that
which is present and forgetting what is absent,
إِنْ ذَهَبَ العَيْرُ فَعَيْرٌ فِى الرِّبَاطِ [If the ass has gone
away, there is an ass in the tether]. (A 'Obeyd.)
―
-b3-  You say also, of a place in which is no good,
هُوَ كَجَوْفِ عَيْرٍ [It is like the belly of an ass],
(S, TA,) or كجوف العَيْرِ [like the belly of the
ass]; (TA;) because there is nothing in his belly
of which any use is made: (S, TA:) or this
originated from the saying هُوَ أَخْلَى مِنْ جَوْفِ
حِمَارٍ [It is more empty than the valley of Himar];
(S, O, * TA;) for حمار was the name of a certain
unbeliever, who possessed a valley, which for his
infidelity, God rendered waste and unproductive;
(O, * TA;) and Imra-el-Keys, (O, TA,) as some
say, but correctly Taäbbata-sharrà, (O,) quoting
the above-mentioned saying, has substituted العير
for حمار, for the sake of the metre. (O, TA.)
―
-b4-  One says also أَذَلُّ مِنَ العَيْرِ More vile than
the ass. (TA.) [But this is doubtful: see the
same phrase expl. differently later in this paragraph. The wild ass is superior to every other
kind of animal that is an object of the chase: (see
فَرَأٌ:) and hence, app., the signification here next
following.] ―
-b5-  عَيْرٌ also signifies A lord, or chief,
(S, O, K,) of a people: (S, O:) a king: (K:)
pl. أَعْيَارٌ. (O.) ―
-b6-  The saying (S, K) of the people
of Syria, used by them proverbially, (TA,) عَيْرٌ
بِعَيْرٍ وَزِيَادَةُ عَشَرَةٍ [A lord for a lord, or a lord is
succeeded by a lord, and an increase of ten] is
expl. by the fact that, when the Khaleefeh of the
sons of Umeiyeh died, and another arose, he increased their stipends by ten dirhems: (S, O,
K:) so they said thus on that occasion. (O,
TA.) ―
-b7-  عَيْرُ السَّرَاةِ is an appellation of A certain
bird, (S, O, K, TA,) resembling the pigeon, (S,
O, TA,) short in the legs, which are coved with
feathers, yellow in the legs and bill, having the
eye bordered with black, of a clear colour inclining
to greenness, or dark dust-colour, (خُضْرَة,) yellow
in the belly and the part beneath its wings and the
inner part of its tail; as though it were a variegated بُرْد: pl. عُيُورُ السَّرَاةِ: السَّرَاةُ being a place in
the district of Et-Táïf: they assert that this bird
eats three hundred figs, from the time of their
coming forth from among the leaves, small; and
in like manner, grapes. (TA.)
-A2-  Also The prominence, or ridge, in the middle of the iron head
or blade of an arrow or of a spear or of a sword
or of a knife or the like. (S, O.) [See ذُبَابٌ.]
―

wall, (TA,) in the middle of a leaf; its middle
rib. (S, O, TA.) ―

part, in the middle of the scapula, or shoulderblade. (S, O.) ―
-b4-  The prominent, or projecting,
bone in the middle of the hand: pl. أَعْيَارٌ. (TA.)
[In the K, it is expl. simply by العَظْمُ النَّاتِئُ
وَسَطَهَا: but this is a wrong reading, app. occasioned by an omission, which is supplied in the
TA, though somewhat awkwardly: it seems that
we should read وَمِنَ الكَفِّ العَظْمُ النَّتِئُ وَسَطَهَا;
or, more probably, ومن الكَتِفِ الخ; for I incline
to think that الكفّ in the TA is a mistake for
الكتف, and that the last signification of عير, given
here, is doubtful.] ―
-b5-  The prominence, or protuberance, in the upper, or convex, part, or back,
of the foot. (S, O, TA.) ―
-b6-  Any prominent, or
protuberant, bone in the body. (TA.) ―
-b7-  An edge,
or a ridge, of a rock, naturally prominent. (TA.)
―
-b8-  Anything prominent, or protuberant, in an
even thing, (K,) or in the middle of an even thing
[or surface]. (TA.) ―
-b9-  Each of the two portions
of flesh and sinew next the back bone, one on either
side thereof: both together are called عَيْرَانِ. (K, *
TA.) [So called because it forms a kind of
ridge.] ―
-b10-  The prominent, or protuberant, part
at the pupil (بُؤْبُؤ) of the eye: (AA, TA:) or the
lid of the eye: (S, O, K:) or the inner angle [for
مَأٰقِى, in the CK, I read مَأْقَى, as in other copies
of the K,] of the eye: (Th, K:) or the image
that is seen in the black of the eye when a thing
faces it; (Aboo-Tálib, L, K; *) also called لُعْبَةٌ:
(Aboo-Tálib, L:) or the eye-ball: (TA:) or a
looking from the outer angle (لَحْظ [or perhaps
this signifies here the outer angle itself]) of the
eye. (K.) Hence the saying, (S, O,) فَعَلْتُ ذَاكَ
قَبْلَ عَيْرٍ وَمَا جَرَى I did that before a look from
the outer angle of the eye: (S, O, K: *) or before
he winked [or could wink]; عير meaning the
“ image that is seen in the black of the eye; ”
and ما جرى, “what moved,” i. e., “the eye
itself: ” (Aboo-Tálib:) or before I looked [or
could look] at thee; not used with a negative:
(Th:) nor do you say أَفْعَلُ ذاك [instead of فعلت
ذاك in this phrase]: (A O, S:) or عير here signifies the wild ass. (Lh.) You say also أَتَيْتُكَ قَبْلَ
عَيْرٍ وَمَا جَرَى, meaning I came to thee before a
sleeper awoke [or could awake]. (AA, TA.) ―
-b11-
The وَتِد [or tragus] which is in the inner part of
the ear: (S:) [see وَتِدٌ:] or the part of the interior of the ear which is below the فَرْع [or upper
portion thereof], (K,) in a man and in a horse,
like the عَيْر [of the head] of an arrow: (TA:) or
the عَيْرَانِ are the مَتْنَانِ [app. meaning the two
backs, though the word may have some other application in this case,] of the two ears of a horse:
pl. عِيَارٌ. (TA.)
-A3-  A wooden pin, peg, or stake,
which is fixed in the ground or in a wall. (S, O,
K.) Hence, as some say, the prov. فُلَانٌ أَذَلُّ مِنَ
العَيْرِ [Such a one is more vile than the wooden pin,
or peg, of a tent &c.]. (TA.) [See another explanation above: and see also مَذَلَّةٌ.] Hence also,
accord. to some, (TA,) one says, مَا أَدْرِى أَىُّ مَنْ
ضَرَبَ العَيْرَ هُوَ, meaning I known not what one of
mankind is he. (Yaakoob, S, O, K, TA.) And
hence too, as some say, the saying of El-Hárith
Ibn-Hillizeh, (O, TA,)
زَعَمُوا أَنَّ كُلَّ مَنْ ضَرَبَ العَيْ
رَ مَوَالٍ لَنَا وَأَنَّا الوَلَآءُ
of which Aboo-'Amr Ibn-El-'Alà said that he had
passed away, or died, who knew the meaning of
this verse, (S, O, TA,) and which is differently
related, some saying مَوَالٍ لَهَا, and some saying
الوِلَآءُ: (TA:) but various meanings are assigned
to العير in this instance; and some expl. it as a
proper name: (O, TA:) and some, relating this
verse, say العِيرَ [q. v.]: (TA:) [the following
explanation of the verse has been given as preferable to others:] They (the Arákim, mentioned
two verses before,) have asserted that all who have
hunted the wild ass are the sons of our paternal
uncles, and that we are the relations of them;
الولآء being for أَصْحَابُ وَلَائِهِمْ: meaning that we
are responsible for their crimes, or offences, as
though we were their heirs. (EM p. 261.)
-A4-
Also A certain piece of wood which is in the fore
part of the [vehicle called] هَوْدَج. (O, K.)
-A5-
And A drum. (O, K.) And so, as some say, in
the verse cited above. (O, TA.)
-A6-  And A mountain. (K.) And also the name of A mountain of
El-Medeeneh: (K, TA:) and, as some say, of a
mountain of Mekkeh. (TA.)
-A7-  And الأَعْيَارُ (of
which the sing. is العَيْرُ, TA) is a name of Certain
bright stars in the track of the feet of سُهَيْل [or
Canopus]. (O, K.)
عِيرٌ A caravan; syn. قَافِلَةٌ; of the fem. gen.:
(K:) from عَارَ “ he journeyed: ” (TA:) or camels
that carry provision of corn: (S, Mgh, O, Msb,
K:) then generally applied to any caravan: (Mgh,
Msb:) or a caravan of asses; and then extended
to any caravan; as though pl. of عَيْرٌ, being originally and regularly of the measure فُعُلٌ, [i. e.
عُيُرٌ,] like سُقُفٌ as pl. of سَقْفٌ; (TA;) but it has
no proper sing.: (K:) or any beasts upon which
provision of corn is brought, whether camels or
asses or mules: (K:) the عير mentioned in the
Kur xii. 94 consisted of asses; and the assertion
of him who says that عير is applied specially to
camels is false: (AHeyth, O, TA:) Nuseyr cites
the poet Aboo-'Amr El-Asadee as applying this
appellation to asses; and says that camels are
not so called unless employed for bringing provision of corn: (AHeyth, TA:) IAar says that
it is applied to camels bearing burdens, and not
bearing burdens: (Az:) but camels are not thus
called that bring corn for their owners: (TA,
voce رِكَاب:) pl. عِيَرَاتٌ, (O, K,) with ا and ت
because it is of the fem. gender, and, being a
subst., with the ى movent, accord. to the dial.
of Hudheyl, for they say جَوْزَاتٌ and بَيْضَاتٌ;
(Sb;) and عِيْرَاتٌ (S, K) is allowable, (S,) and is
the regular form, and occurs in a trad., meaning
horses or the like, and camels carrying merchandise. (TA.)
عَيْرَانٌ applied to a he-camel, (O,) and عَيْرَانَةٌ
applied to a she-camel, (S, O, K,) Resembling the
[wild] ass (العَيْر) in quickness and briskness: (S,
O:) or the latter, swift, with briskness; (K, TA;)
so termed because of her frequent going round
about [or to and fro], rather than as being
likened to the [wild] ass: and also hard, or
hardy. (TA.)
عِيرَانٌ: see عَائِرٌ in art. عور.
عِيَارٌ and ↓ مِعْيَارٌ are syn.; (S;) both signify [A
standard of measure or weight;] a thing with
which another thing is measured, or compared,
and equalized; (Mgh;) [and with which it is
assayed:] or a thing with which measures of
capacity are measured, compared, or equalized:
(Lth:) the عِيَار of a thing is that which is made,
or appointed, a standard thereof, by which to
regulate or adjust it; expl. by مَا جُعِلَ نِظَامًا لَهُ.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  The عِيَار of dirhems, and of deenárs,

(assumed tropical:)  Such a one is a person who is pleased with his
own opinion; (S, O, K;) an expression of dispraise; (S;) like as نَسِيجُ وَحْدِهِ is one of praise:
(TA:) or a person who does not consult others,
nor mix with them, yet in whom is ignobleness and
weakness; as also جُحَيْشُ وَحْدِهِ [q. v.]: (Az:)
or a person who eats by himself. (Th, K.) You
may also say عِيَيْرٌ, like شِيَيْخٌ for شُيَيْخٌ; but you
should not say عُوَيْر, nor شُوَيْخ. (S, O.)
عَيِّرٌ: see عَائِرٌ.
عَيَّارٌ: see the next paragraph, in five places.
عَائِرٌ That goes to and fro, and round about;
as also ↓ عَيَّارٌ: both are applied [to a man and]
also to a dog: (TA:) and ↓ the latter is also
expl. as follows: a man (TA) often coming and
going (K, TA) in the land: (TA:) often going
round about, (Fr, S, Msb, K,) often in motion,
(Fr, S, Msb,) and sharp, or quick, of intellect:
(S, K:) it is used as an epithet of praise and as
one of dispraise: for instance, applied to a boy,
it signifies brisk in obeying God, and brisk in acts
of disobedience: (IAar:) and ↓ عَيِّرٌ, applied to a
horse, signifies brisk, lively, or sprightly: (IAar:)
and ↓ عَيَّارٌ, so applied, mischievous; and that is
brisk, lively, or sprightly, so that he goes on one
side of the way, and then turns to the other side:
(TA:) and, applied to a man, that goes to and
fro without work: (Ajnás en-Nátifee, Mgh:) or
that leaves himself to follow his natural desire, not
restraining himself. (IAmb, Mgh, Msb.) It is
said in a prov., كَلْبٌ عَائِرٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ أَسَدٍ رَابِضٍ A
dog going to and fro and round about is better [as
a guard] than a lion lying down. (TA.) You say
also شَاةٌ عَائِرَةٌ A sheep that goes to and fro between
two flocks, not knowing which of them to follow:
to such is a hypocrite likened. (TA.) And نَاقَةٌ
عَائِرَةٌ A she-camel that goes forth from the other
camels in order that the stallion may cover her
(S, O, TA.) And جَمَلٌ عَائِرٌ A he-camel that
leaves the females seven months gone with young,
and goes to others. (S.) And بأَوْصَالٍ ↓ عَيَّارٌ A
horse that goes away hither and thither, by reason
of his sprightliness: (S, O:) or a lion that goes
away with the joints, or whole bones. of men to
his thicket. (IB.) ↓ العَيَّارُ is an appellation given
to The lion, (S, O, K,) because of his coming and
going in search of his prey. (S, O.) ―

مَا قَالَتِ العَرَبُ بَيْتًا أَعْيَرَ مِنْهُ The Arabs have not
uttered a verse more current than it. (A, O, TA.)
مُعَارٌ A horse, (S, K,) and a dog, (K.) made
to go away as though he had escaped. or got loose:
(K:) or made to escape: (TA:) or made to
escape, or get loose, and go away hither and
thither, by reason of his exceeding sprightliness.
(S.) It is also expl. as signifying, applied to a
horse, Fattened: and having the hair of is tail
plucked out: these two explanations mentioned
by IKtt and others: and made lean, or light of
flesh. (TA. [See 4, last sentence.]) See also the
next paragraph.
مِعَارٌ, (O, K,) as though originally مِعْيَرٌ, from
عَارَ, aor. يَعِيرُ, (Az, O,) A horse that turns away
from the road with his rider. (O, K.) Hence
the saying of Bishr Ibn-Abee-Házim, (K,) or
Kházim, as written by Sgh, (TA,) not Et-Tirimmáh, J having made a mistake [in ascribing it
to him (but in one of my copies of the S it is
ascribed to Bishr Ibn-Abee-Házim and in the
other to a poet unnamed)],
أَحَقُّ الخَيْلِ بِالرَّكْضِ المِعَارُ
[The most deserving, of horses, of being urged to
run by the striking with the foot is he that turns
away from the road with his rider]. (K.) Aboo-
'Obeyd, (so in my copies of the S,) or Aboo-
'Obeydeh, (so in the K and TA,) says that the
people, in relating this, say ↓ المُعَارُ, [deriving it]
from العَارِيَّة; which is a mistake: (S, K, TA:)
the truth being that this is a mistake as to the
damm and the derivation; which is the saying of
IAar alone, and is mentioned by IB also:
(TA:) or the last word is المُغَارُ. (TA in
art. غور, q. v.)
نَصْلٌ مُعْيَرٌ An iron head or blade, of an arrow
or of a spear or of a sword or of a knife or the
like, having what is termed عَيْرٌ. (AHn, from AA.)
And كَفٌّ مُعْيِرَةٌ, and ↓ مُعَيِّرَةٌ, [so in the TA, but
more probably مُعْيَرَةٌ and مُعَيَّرَةٌ,] A كَفّ [or hand]
having what is so termed. (TA. [But I think that
كَفٌّ is here a mistranscription for كَتِفٌ: see
عَيْرٌ.])
اِبْنَةُ مِعْيَرٍ Calamity, (K, TA,) and hardship.
(TA.) And بَنَاتُ مِعْيَرٍ Calamities. (S, O, TA,)
and hardships. (TA.)
مُعْيَرَةٌ, and the pl. مَعَايِرٌ: see عَارٌ
كَفٌّ مُعَيَّرَةٌ [or كَتِفٌ?]: see مُعْيَرٌ.
مِعْيَارٌ: see عِيَارٌ.
مَعْيُورَى and مَعْيُورَآءُ: see عَيْرٌ, first sentence.
مُسْتَعِيرٌ Resembling the عَيْر [i. e. ass, or wild, ass,]
in make. (O, K.)
