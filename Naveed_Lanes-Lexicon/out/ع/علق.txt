seen from what follows]; and ↓ تعلّق, (S, MA,
Mgh, O, Msb,) and ↓ اعتلق; (O, Msb, KL;) It
hung to it; it was, or became, suspended to it:
(so the first and last accord. to the KL, and the
second accord. to the MA and common usage:
[in the S and Mgh and O, it is merely said that
the first and second signify the same:]) [and] it
clung, caught, clave, adhered, held, or stuck fast,
to it; (Msb in explanation of all, and TA * in
explanation of the first;) and so ↓ تعلّقهُ. (S, * O, *
TA.) It is said in a prov., (S, O, TA,) asserted
in the K to have been mentioned before, which is
not found to be the case, (TA,)
وَصَرَّ الجُنْدَبُ ↓ عَلِقَتْ مَعَالِقَهَا
(S, O, K, [in the CK, erroneously, مُعالِقَها,]) [It
(the bucket, الدَّلْوُ, Z, TA) has become suspended
in its places of suspension, and the جندب (accord.
to the S and K a species of locust) has creaked]:
originating from the fact that a man went to a
well, and suspended his well-rope to the rope
thereof, and then went to the owner of the well,
and claimed to be his neighbour [and therefore to
have a right to the use of the well]; but the
owner refused his assent, and ordered him to
depart; whereupon he uttered these words, meaning The heat has come, [see صَرَّ الجُنْدَبُ in art.
جدب,] and I am not able to depart. (S, O. [See
more in Freytag's Arab. Prov. ii. 91.]) And one
says, عَلِقَ الشَّوْكُ بِالثَّوْبِ, aor.

(K;) or عَلِقَ الوَحْشُ بِالْحِبَالَةِ, inf. n. عُلُوقٌ, (Msb,)
[The gazelle, or the animal of the chase, became
caught, or stuck fast, in the snare; or the wild
animal became caught, or held fast, thereby, or]
became withheld from getting loose [thereby]:
whence the saying, عَلِقَ الخَصْمُ بِخَصْمِهِ and
بِهِ ↓ تعلّق [The antagonist became held fast, or
withheld from getting loose, by his antagonist;
and also the antagonist clung, or held fast, to his
antagonist]. (Msb.) [―
-b2-  The primary significations are those mentioned above in the first sentence: and hence several other significations here
following. ―

(K,) [He became attached by love to her, or to
him;] he loved (S, O, K) her, (S, O,) or him;
(K;) and so عَلِقَ حُبُّهَا بِقَلْبِهِ; (S, O;) and ↓ تعلّقها,
and تعلّق بِهَا; [the former of these two phrases
being used for the latter, agreeably with a saying
of IAmb cited in the TA in art. ارى, that تَعَلَّقْتُ
فُلَانًا is for تعلّقت بِفُلَانٍ;] like ↓ اعتلق [i. e. اعتلقها
and اعتلق بها], (K,) or اعتلقهُ, (S,) or اعتلق بِهِ;
(TA;) and ↓ عُلِّقَهَا, (S, * O, * K, TA,) from عَلَاقَةُ
الحُبِّ, (S, O, TA,) and بِهَا ↓ عُلِّقَ, (TA,) [but this
last verb is more commonly trans. by itself, for
ex.,] El-Aashà says,
عُلِّقْتُهَا عَرَضًا وَعُلِّقَتْ رَجُلًا
غَيْرِى وَعُلِّقَ أُخْرَى غَيْرَهَا الرَّجُلُ
[I became attached to her accidentally, and she
became attached to a man other than me, and the
man became attached to another female, other than
her]. (S, O. [See also another ex., in a verse of
'Antarah, cited voce زَعَمَ.]) [See also عَلَقٌ, below.] ―
-b6-  ↓ عَلِقَتْ مِنْهُ كُلَّ مَعْلَقٍ [which may be
rendered She captivated him wholly] occurs in a

[app. meaning Old age has taken hold in its holding places, or, agreeably with what is said in the
next sentence, has had its effects], in which معالق
is pl. of مَعْلَقٌ, is said to an old man. (TA.) And
of everything that has had its effect [so I here
render وَقَعَ مَوْقِعَهُ, but see art. وقع], one says, عَلِقَ
↓ مَعَالِقَهُ. (TA, and Ham p. 172.) ―
-b9-  عَلِقَتْ مَرَاسِيهَا
بِذِى رَمْرَامٍ [Their anchors have clung to a place
having the species of herbage called رمرام, meaning
they are abiding therein, (see مِرْسَاةٌ, in art. رسو,)]
is said of camels when they are at rest, or at ease,
and their eyes are refreshed by the pasturage; and
is a prov., applied to persons in the like condition
by reason of their means of subsistence. (TA.)
―
-b10-  عَلِقَ بِهِ, inf. n. عَلَقٌ, He contended with him
in an altercation [as though clinging to him];

began, or betook himself to, doing such a thing.
(S, O, K.) فَعَلِقُوا وَجْهَهُ ضَرْبًا occurs in a trad.,
meaning They set about, or betook themselves to,
smiting his face. (TA.) And a rájiz says,
عَلِقَ حَوْضِى نُغَرٌ مُكِبُّ
[Nughar (a species of birds) bending down their
heads] betook themselves to coming for the purpose
of drinking to my حوض [or watering-trough]:
or, as some say, liked it, and frequented it. (S,
O.) ―
-b13-  And مَا عَلِقْتُ أَقْولُهُ means I did not cease
saying it; like ما نَشِبْتُ. (A in art. نشب.) [Thus
عَلِقَ has two contr. meanings.] ―
-b14-  عَلِقَتِ الإِبِلُ
العِضَاهَ, (S, O, K,) aor.
عَلَقَ; (K;) and عَلَقَت likewise, aor.
عَلُقَ; (S, O, K;) inf. n. عَلْقٌ; (S, O, K; *)
The camels fed upon the upper, or uppermost, portions of the [trees called] عضاه, (S, O, K,) reaching
them with their mouths: (S and O in explanation
of the latter verb:) and يَعْلَقُ العِضَاهَ, said of a
camel, he plucks from the عضاه, [as though] hanging from it, by reason of his tallness: (S: in one
of my copies of the S, and in the TA, يَعْلُقُ:) or
one says, of camels, عَلَقَتْ مِنَ الشَّجَرِ, aor.
عَلُقَ,
inf. n. عَلْقٌ and عُلُوقٌ, meaning they ate of the
trees with their mouths: and عَلِقَتْ فِى الوَادِى,
aor.
عَلَقَ, they pastured, or pastured where they
pleased, in the valley: (Msb:) accord. to Lh,
عَلَقَتْ, aor.
عَلُقَ, inf. n. عَلْقٌ, said of beasts, means
they ate the leaves of the trees: and accord. to
As, عَلَقَتْ, aor.
عَلُقَ, inf. n. عُلُوقٌ, means they
reached and took with their mouths. (TA.)
Hence, (TA,) it is said in a trad., أَرْوَاحُ الشُّهَدَآءِ
فِى حَوَاصِلِ طَيْرٍ خُضْرٍ تَعْلُقُ مِنْ وَرَقِ الجَنَّةِ, (S,
Msb, *) or مِنْ ثِمَارِ الجَنَّةِ, (TA,) and, as some
relate it, تَعْلَقُ, (Msb, TA,) [both as meaning
The souls of the martyrs are in the crops of green
birds that eat of the leaves, or fruits, of Paradise,]
but the former relation is that which should be
followed, because the latter requires that one
should say فِى ورق الجنّة [or فى ثمار الجنّة],
though the latter is said to be the more common.
(Msb.) One says also, عَلِقَتِ الإِبِلُ, aor.
عَلَقَ,
inf. n. عَلَقٌ, meaning The camels ate of the عُلْقَة
of the trees, i. e., of the trees that remain in the

K,) inf. n. عُلُوقٌ, (Mgh,) or عَلَقٌ, (TA,) The
woman conceived, or became pregnant. (S, Mgh,
O, K.) Hence the saying, الغِرَاسُ تَبَدَّلُ بِالعُلُوقِ
(tropical:)  [The set, or shoot that is planted, becomes
changed by pullulating]; a metaphorical phrase;
meaning that what is planted becomes changed
because it increases and rises when it clings to the
earth and germinates. (Mgh.) ―
-b18-  عَلِقَتِ الدَّابَّةُ
The beast drank water and the leech (العَلَقَةُ) clave
to it: (S, O, K:) or, accord. to an explanation of
[the part. n.] مَعْلُوقٌ by Lth, one says عُلِقَت, of
the form of that whereof the agent is not named,
meaning it had leeches (عَلَق) that had taken hold
upon its fauces when it drank: (O:) or عُلِقَ,

harnessed, or attached, the horses to the carriage.]
And أَظْفَارَهُ فِى الشَّىْءِ ↓ اعلق He made his nails to
cling, catch, or cleave, to the thing. (S, TA.)
And [in like manner,] علّق يَدَهُ and ↓ اعلقها [He
made his hands to cling, &c.], followed by فى

And علّق الدَّابَّةَ, meaning علّق عَلَيْهَا [for علّق عليها
المِخْلَاةَ, agreeably with modern usage, i. e. He
hung upon the beast the nose-bag containing barley,
or the like; or he supplied the beast with عَلِيق,
which means barley, or the like, that is hung upon
the beast]. (TA.) [And hence, as is indicated
in the T and TA, علّق signifies, by a metaphor,
(tropical:)  He supplied with عَلِيق as meaning wine.] And
علّق رَاحِلَتَهُ He loosed the halter, or leading-rope,

am left in suspense, i. e.,] he leaves me like that

phrase تَعْلِيقُ أَفْعَالِ القُلُوبِ The suspending of the
verbs significant of operations of the mind from
government, as to the letter but not as to the meaning:] see مُعَلَّقٌ. ―
-b5-  [علّق البِنَآءَ He made the building, or structure, pensile, i. e. supported above the
ground, or above a stage or floor, by pillars or
piers or otherwise. Hence,] the saying نَقَبُوا
الحَائِطَ وَعَلَّقُوهُ means They dug beneath the wall

is a prov., said to a man who is thereby enjoined
to be content with a part of that which he wants,
instead of the whole thereof; like him who rides

time: [so that it means Be thou content, instead
of the riding constantly, or instead of the beast
that is ridden only, with the sending a camel to
bring corn, upon which thou mayest ride occasionally:] (TA:) or the meaning may be, be thou
content, instead of thy riding, with the hanging of
thy goods upon the beast: or the meaning may
be, be thou content, in respect of the beast that is
ridden, with the hanging [thy goods] upon him in
thy turn. (Meyd.) ―

لَيْسَ بِهَا علِقَةٌ is a phrase mentioned by Ibn-'Abbád,
(O, TA,) as meaning [app.] اصرة. (TA. [This
word, in the TA, is blurred: and in the O, the
place that it occupied has perished: I think that
it is most probably أَصِرَّةٌ, pl. of صِرَارٌ; and therefore that the phrase means Camels not having
upon them strings, or pieces of rag, bound upon
their udders or teats, to prevent their young ones
from sucking: for one says صَرَّ بِالنَّاقَةِ as well as
صَرَّ النَّاقَةَ; and in like manner, I suppose, one
may say لَيْسَ بِهَا أَصِرَّةٌ: and hence, perhaps, it
may mean not having milk: see the phrase مَا
بِالنَّاقَةِ عَلُوقٌ.])
-A4-  [For the phrase اِسْتَأْصَلَ اللّٰهُ
عِلْقَاتَهُِمْ, see the next paragraph but one.]
عَلْقَى, (S, O, K,) like سَكْرَى, (K,) A certain
plant: (S, O, K:) accord. to Sb, (S, O,) it is
used as sing. and pl.; (S, O, K;) and its alif
[written ى] is to denote the fem. gender, therefore it is without tenween: but others say that its
alif is to render it quasi-coordinate [to the quadriliteral-radical class], and is with tenween, the
n. un. being عَلْقَاةٌ: (S, O:) IJ says that the alif
in عَلْقَاةٌ is not to denote the fem. gender, because
it is followed by ة; but when they elide the ة,
they say عَلْقَى, without tenween: (L, TA: [in
both of which, more is added, but with some
mistranscription or omission rendering it inconsistent:]) its twigs are slender, difficult to be
broken, and brooms are made of it: (K: [but
this is taken from what here follows:]) Aboo-Nasr says, the علقى is a tree [or plant] of which
the greenness continues during the hot season, and
its places of growth are the sands, and the plain,
or soft, tracts: and he says, an Arab of the desert
showed me a plant which he asserted to be the
علقى; having long and slender twigs, and delicate
leaves; called in Pers. خُلْوَام [?]; those who
collect [the dung used for fuel called] جَلَّة make of
it brooms for that purpose: to which he adds,
and it is said, on the authority of the early Arabs,
that the علقاة is a certain tree [or plant] which is
found in the sands, green, having leaves, but in
which is no good: (O:) [it is said, however,
that] the decoction thereof is drunk for the dropsy.
(K.)
عِلْقَاتَهُمْ, (O, K,) like سِعْلَاتَهُمْ, (O,) in the saying اِسْتَأْصَلَ اللّٰهُ عِلْقضاتَهُمْ, (O, K, * [in the CK
عَلْقاتَهُمْ,]) is a dial. var. of عِرْقَاتَهُمْ, (K, [in the
CK عَرْقاتَهُمْ,]) [and] is said by Ibn-'Abbád to
mean أَصْلَهُمْ [i. e. May God utterly destroy their
race, stock, or family]: but some say that it is a
pl. of العِلْقُ signifying “ that which is precious,
or held in high estimation: ” and in one dial. it
is [عِلْقَاتِهِمْ,] with kesr to the ت. (O.)
عَلِقْنَةٌ: see عَلَاقِيَةٌ.
عَلَاقٌ: see عُلْقَةٌ, in eight places.
عَلَاقِ [an imperative verbal noun], like نَزَالِ
&c., (IDrd, O, K, *) means تَعَلَّقْ, (K,) or تَعَلَّقْ
بِهِ [i. e. Cling thou, cleave thou, or stick thou fast,
to him, or it]. (IDrd, O.)
عِلَاقٌ A thing that is hung, or suspended, like
the عُوذَة [or amulet]. (TA voce مَعْذُورٌ as an
epithet applied to a child affected with the pain,
of the fauces, termed عُذْرَة.)

-b2-  And [hence,] Death, or the decree of death;
syn. مَنِيَّةٌ; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ عَلَّاقَةٌ, (S, TA,)
accord. to the K, erroneously, عَلَاقَة [without
teshdeed]: in a verse in which it occurs, some
explain العَلَّاقَةُ as meaning thus; and some, as
meaning the serpent, because of its clinging.
(TA.) El-Mufaddal En-Nukree says,
وَقَدْ عَلِقَتْ بِثَعْلَبَةَ العَلُوقُ
[When death, or the decree of death, had clung to
Thaalebeh]. (S, O.) The pl. of عَلُوقٌ, in this
sense, and in the sense next following, as mentioned before, in the paragraph commencing with
the word عُلَقَ, is عُلُقٌ, with two dammehs. (TA.
See that paragraph.) ―
-b3-  And [hence, likewise,]
A calamity, or misfortune. (O, K.) It occurs in
a trad. in this sense, applied to what is termed
عُذْرَة, or to the operation performed upon it. (O,
TA. [See 4.]) ―

-A2-  Also Pasture
upon which camels feed. (S, O, K.) And Trees
that are eaten by the camels that have been ten
months pregnant, (O, K,) in consequence of which
they assume a red hue. (O.) El-Aashà speaks of
it [in a verse of which I find four different read-
ings] as occasioning a redness in she-camels: but
some say that he means thereby The young in the
bellies; and by the redness, the beauty of their
colour on the occasion of conceiving. (S, O.)
And some say that, as used by El-Aashà, it
means The sperma of the stallion; a signification
mentioned by AHeyth; because the she-camels
become altered in colours, and red, when they
conceive. (TA.) ―
-b2-  مَا بِالنَّاقَةِ عَلُوقٌ means There
is not in the she-camel aught of milk. (S. [And
عَلَاقٌ signifies the same: see an ex. voce عُلْقَةٌ.])
-A3-  Also A she-camel that is made to incline
(تُعْطَفُ [in the CK تَعْطَفُ]) to a young one not
her own, and will not keep to it, but only smells it
with her nose, and refuses to yield her milk; (S,
O, K; [see an ex. in a verse cited in the first
paragraph of art. رأم;]) as also ↓ مُعَالِقٌ: (S:) or
a she-camel that inclines to her young one, and
feels it, until it becomes familiar with her, but
when it desires to suck the milk from her, strikes
it, and drives it away. (Ham p. 206.) [Hence,]
one says of him who speaks a speech with which
is no deed, عَامَلَنَا مُعَامَلَةَ العَلُوقِ [He dealt with
us with the dealing of the علوق]. (O, K.) ―
-b2-
And A she-camel that does not become familiar
with the stallion nor affect the young one: (Lth,
O, K:) as implying a presage of good [i. e. that
she will cling to both]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And A woman
that does not love other than her husband: (Lth,
O, K:) likewise as implying a presage of good.

another. (Lth, O, K.) ―

-b2-  One
says also, لِى فِى الأَمْرِ عُلُوقٌ There is something
made obligatory to me, or in my favour, in the
affair, or case; and so ↓ مُتَعَلَّقٌ. (TA.)
عَلِيقٌ i. q. قَضِيمٌ, (S, MA, K, TA,) i. e. Barley
for a horse or similar beast, (MA,) [in which
sense and also as meaning provender of beans and
the like, the former word is now used, properly,
or originally,] that is hung upon the beast [in a
مِخْلَاة, or nose-bag]: (TA:) pl. عَلَائِقُ. (MA.)
―
-b2-  And hence, as being likened thereto, (tropical:)  Wine.
(TA.)
عَلَاقَةٌ [is originally an inf. n.: and as a simple
subst. signifies An attachment, a tie, or a connection; as also ↓ عُلْقَةٌ, mentioned in the TA, in
art. ربط, together with وُصْلَةٌ, as syn. with رَابِطَةٌ:]
a word relating to things conceived in the mind;
as love, and contention in an altercation: ↓ عِلَاقَةٌ
relating to things extrinsic to the mind; as a
bow, and a whip: (Kull p. 262:) see عَلَقٌ, last
quarter. ―
-b2-  [Hence, as denoting an attachment,
or a tie,] Love, and friendship; or such as is true,
or sincere; syn. حُبٌّ, and صَدَاقَةٌ: (K, TA:) [or
as expl. voce عَلَقٌ, last quarter:] or it means
عَلَاقَةُ حُبٍّ [an attachment, or a tie, or a clinging,
of love]: (S, O:) Lh mentions, on the authority
of Ks, and as known to As, the saying لَهَا فِى
قَلْبِى عَلَاقَةُ حُبٍّ [i. e. There is to her, in my heart,
an attachment, or a tie, or a clinging, of love];
and likewise, on the authority of the former, but
as unknown to As, حُبٍّ ↓ عِلْقُ and حُبٍّ ↓ عِلَاقَةُ,
though As knew the phrase حُبٍّ ↓ عَلَقُ: (TA:)
or عَلَاقَةُ حُبٍّ means love to which one clings.
(Msb.) ―
-b3-  And A contention in an altercation;
a dispute; or a litigation: (K: [see also عَلَقٌ,
near the end of the paragraph:]) or it means
عَلَاقَةُ خُصُومَةٍ [app. one's connection in such a
contention]: (S, O:) or عَلَاقَةُ خُصُومَةٍ means the
proportion [or share] that one holds [in such a
contention; or what pertains to one thereof; or
one's concern therein]: (Msb:) [for] ―
-b4-  عَلَاقَةٌ
also signifies A thing upon which one has, or
retains, a hold; like ↓ عُلْقَةٌ in the saying كُلُّ
بَيْعٍ أَبْقَى عُلْقَةً فَهُوَ بِاطِلٌ i. e. [Every sale that
leaves remaining] a thing upon which the seller
retains a hold [is null]. (Msb.) And one says,
مَا بَيْنَهُمَا عَلَاقَةٌ, with fet-h, meaning There is not
between them two anything upon which either of
them has a hold against the other: and the pl. is
عَلَائِقُ. (TA.) And لِفُلَانٍ فِى هٰذَا الدَّارِ عَلَاقَةٌ,
[or rather هٰذِهِ الدار,] with fet-h, i. e. [There
belongs to such a one, in this house, something
upon which he has a hold, or in which he has a
concern, or] a remaining portion of a share.
(TA.) العَلَاقَةُ مِنَ المَهْرِ means That [portion, or
amount, of the dowry, or nuptial gift,] upon
which they have a hold against him who takes
a woman in marriage: (Sh, K, TA:) pl. عَلَائِقُ
[as above]: (K, TA:) whence the saying, in a
trad., أَدُّوا العَلَائِقَ i. e., as expl. by the Prophet,
[Pay ye] what their families have agreed upon;
meaning, what attack each one of them [by an
obligation] to his companion, or fellow, like as a
thing is attached to another thing. (TA.) And
[the pl.] عَلَائِقُ likewise signifies [Obligations of
bloodwits; or] bloodwits that are attached to a
man. (TA.) [See also another explanation in

-b7-  [The pl.] عَلَائِقُ
is also expl. by Lh as meaning Articles of merchandise. (TA.) ―
-b8-  And العَلَاقَةُ is said by Sh
to signify النَبْلُ [evidently, I think, a mistranscription for التَّبْلُ, i. e. Blood-revenge; or the
seeking for blood-revenge, or the like; though it
seems to be better rendered the obligation of bloodrevenge; or the obligation of a bloodwit, attaching
to a man, agreeably with an explanation given
above]: and by Aboo-Nasr to signify التَّبَاعُدُ
[which I think to be a mistranscription for التَّنَافُدُ,
signifying contention, disputation, or litigation, a
meaning mentioned in the former half of this
paragraph]: and both of these significations are
assigned to it in the saying of Imra-el-Keys,
بِأَىِّ عَلَاقَتِنَا تَرْغَبُو
نَ عَنْ دَمِ عَمْرٍو عَلَى مَرْثَدِ
[as though meaning By reason of what bloodrevenge, &c., of ours do ye relinquish the claim for
the blood of 'Amr resting as a debt upon Marthad?
or What is our contention, &c.? Do ye relinquish

Slane's “ Diwan d'Amro'lkais,” p. 48, line 4, of
the Ar. text. (in which the former hemistich ends
with ترغبون and the latter commences with أَعَنْ);

both of these appellations signify a thorny tree
[or shrub], that does not grow large, such that
when a thing catches to it, it can hardly become
free, by reason of the numerousness of its thorns,
which are curved and sharp; and it has a fruit
resembling the فِرْصَاد [or mulberry], (O, TA,)
which, when it becomes ripe, blackens, and is eaten;
(O;) [see also تُوتٌ;] and it is called in Pers.
دَرْكَه [?]; (O, TA;) they assert that it is the
tree in which Moses beheld the fire; (O;) and
the places of its growth are thickets, and tracts
abounding with trees: (O, TA:) the chewing it
hardens, or strengthens, the gum, and cures the
[disease in the mouth called] قُلَاع; and a dressing,
or poultice, thereof cures whiteness of the eye, and
the swelling, or protrusion, thereof, and the piles;
and its root, or stem, (أَصْلُهُ,) crumbles stones in
the kidney. (K.) عُلَّيْقُ الجَبَلِ [in the CK الخَيْلِ]

-b2-  Hence, المُعَلَّقَاتُ السَّبْعُ or السَّبْعُ
المُعَلَّقَاتُ The seven suspended odes; accord. to
several writers: two reasons for their being thus
called are mentioned in the Mz (49th نوع); one,
that “ they were selected from all the poetry, and
written upon قَبَاطِىّ (pieces of fine white cloth of
Egypt) with water-gold, and suspended upon the
Kaabeh; ” the other, that “ when an ode was
deemed excellent, the King used to say, ' Suspend
ye for us this, ' that it might be in his repository: ”
that these odes were selected from all the poetry,
and that any copies of them were suspended collectively upon the Kaabeh, has been sufficiently
confuted in Nöldeke's “ Beiträge zur Kenntniss
der Poesie der alten Araber,” pp. xvii. — xxiii.:
it is not so unreasonable to suppose that they may
have been suspended upon the Kaabeh singly,
at different times, by their own authors or by
admiring friends, and suffered to remain thus
placarded for some days, perhaps during the
period when the city was most thronged by pilgrims; but the latter of the two assertions in the
Mz seems to be more probable. ―
