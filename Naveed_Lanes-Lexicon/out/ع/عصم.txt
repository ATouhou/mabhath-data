and he, or it, preserved, or kept; syn. وَقَى: (K,
TA:) and it withheld (أَمْسَكَ) a thing. (TA.)
One says, عَصَمَهُ الطَّعَامُ [for عَصَمَهُ مِنَ الجُوعِ]

from being hungry. (S, K.) And عَصَمَهُ اللّٰهُ,
(Mgh, Msb, TA,) aor. as above, (Msb, TA,) inf. n.

horse, or his camel, should throw him down; [or
rather اعصم بِشَىْءٍ has this meaning, or he laid
hold, or fast hold, upon a thing, or clung to it;]
and in like manner one says بِهِ ↓ اعتصم, and
به ↓ استعصم; (S;) بِهِ ↓ اعتصم is said by Er-Rághib, to signify thus; whence, in the Kur
[iii. 98], بِحَبْلِ اللّٰهِ ↓ وَاعْتَصمُوا [expl. in art. حبل]:
(TA:) and [hence, likewise,] اعصم بِحَبْلِهِ signifies تَمَسَّكَ بِهِ [meaning He held fast by his corenant]. (Mgh.) One says also, اعصم بِالبَعِيرِ He

as tar [with which camels are smeared when
mangy], (S,) and خِضَاب [i. e. hinnà (حِنَّآء) and
the like, with which one dyes, or tinges, the hair
&c.], and the like: (S, K:) and عُصْمٌ is also
expl. as signifying a trace of anything such as
وَرْس [q. v.] or saffron or the like. (TA.) As
says, I heard an Arab woman of the desert say to
her follow-wife, أَعْطِينِى عُصْمَ حنَّائِكِ, meaning

this last, which is said in the S to be pl. of عُصْمةٌ,
and thought by ISd to be formed from عِصْمَةٌ
after rejecting the augmentative letter [ة], and
said by some to be a pl. of which the sing. is
↓ عِصْمٌ, like as أَعْدَالٌ is of عِدْلٌ, is correctly pl.
of عِصَمٌ, which is pl. of عِصْمَةٌ, (IB, TA.) of
which أَعْصِمَةٌ is also a pl. [of pauc.] (TA.) And
أَعْصَامٌ signifies also The straps (عَذَبَات) that are

said in the Msb to be a simple subst.,] primarily
(TA) signifies مَنْعٌ [as meaning Prevention, or
hindrance: or, as seems to be indicated by most
of its subordinate applications, defence, or protection]: (S, K, TA:) or, as some say, its primary signification is the act of tying, or binding;
and hence the meaning of مَنْعٌ: or, accord. to Zj,
it primarily signifies حَبْلٌ [i. e. a rope, or cord];
and accord. to Mohammad Ibn-Neshwán El-
Himyeree, سَبَبٌ and حَبْلٌ [which mean the same].
(TA.) Defence, or protection, (TA,) or preservation, (S, Msb, K,) [in an absolute sense, and] as
an act of God, (Msb, TA,) from that which
would cause destruction of a man. (TA.) عِصْمَةُ
الأَنْبِيَآءِ signifies God's preservation of the prophets;
first, by the peculiar endowment of them with
essential purity of constitution; then, by the conferring of large and highly-esteemed excellences;
then, by aid against opponents, and rendering their
feet firm; then, by sending down upon them tranquillity (السَّكِينَة, q. v.), [see the Kur ix. 26, &c.,]
and the preservation of their hearts, or minds,
and adaptation to that which is right. (Er-Rá-
ghib, TA.) ―

hand, or power: a term used by the lawyers:]
one says, بِيَدِهِ عِصْمَةُ النِّكَاحِ i. e. [In his hand, or
power, is] the tie, or bond, of marriage: pl.
عِصَمٌ: whence, in the Kur [lx. 10], وَلَا تُمَسِّكُوا
بِعِصَمِ الكَوَافِرِ [And hold ye not to the matrimonial
ties, or bonds, of the unbelieving women; meaning
divorce ye such women: but the common reading
is ولا تُمْسِكُوا, which signifies the same]. (TA.)

binding, of the leathern bucket and of the water-skin and of the [leathern vessel for water called]
إِدَاوَة: and the loop-shaped handle that serves for
the suspending of the [bag, or other receptacle,
for travelling-provisions or for goods or utensils
&c. called] وِعَآء: (K:) and anything that serves
for the protection, or preservation, of a thing:
(TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَعْصِمَةٌ and [of mult.] عُصْمٌ,
(K, TA,) or عُصُمٌ, (Msb, and so in some copies
of the K,) and عِصَامٌ, like the sing., of the class of
دِلَاصٌ: (AZ, K:) but Az states, as what had
been heard [app. by him] from the Arabs, respecting the عُصْم of [the leathern water-bags called]
مَزَاد, that they are the cords that are fixed in the
loops of the pairs of water-bags, and with which
they are tied when they are bound upon the back
of the camel; after which the [rope called] رِوَآء is
bound over them: they are erroneously said by
Lth to be the طَرَائِق [app. meaning borders] of
the extremity of the مَزَادَة [or leathern water-bag],
at the place of the كُلْيَة [or kidney-shaped piece
of leather to which a loop is sewed]. (TA. [See
also خُصْمٌ.]) Mention is made, in a trad., of a
place where a camel was shackled with عُصْم, as
meaning that its abundance of herbage confined
him so that he would not go away in search of
pasturage. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also The cord, or bond, of
the [vehicle called] مَحْمِل, (K, * TA,) which is
bound at the extremity of [each of the transverse
pieces of wood called] the عَارِضَانِ [correctly
عَارِضَتَانِ], in the upper part of each of these: [for,]
as Lth says, there are two of such cords, or bonds:

like those of the [pair of leathern water-bags
called] مَزَادَتَانِ. (TA.) ―

عَصُومٌ Edacious; voracious; (K, TA;) applied to a she-camel; (TA;) and ↓ عَيْصُومٌ signifies the same, (K, TA,) applied to a human
being, male and female; (TA;) the latter occurring in the saying of a rájiz, applied to an old
woman, (S, TA,) and said to have this meaning,
(S,) but as some relate it, the word is there with
ض; (S, TA;) and عَيْضُومٌ signifies thus accord.
to Kr, applied to a woman: عَيْصُومٌ, however,
is of higher authority: (TA in art. عضم:) ↓ عَيْصَامٌ
also signifies the same, applied to a man. (TA.)

the road, in thickness. (TA.) ―

for اذا أَنْسَلَ]). (K.) ―
-b5-  And The leaves of trees.
(IB, TA.)
عِصَامِىٌّ [a rel. n. used as meaning Of the class
of 'Isám; and hence, self-ennobled]. عِصَامٌ is the
name of a chamberlain of En-Noamán Ibn-ElMundhir: and [in relation to him] it is said
in a prov., كُنْ عِصَامِيًّا وَلَا تَكُنْ عِظَامِيًّا, (S, K,
TA,) [the former clause meaning Be thou of the
class of 'Isám, i. e. be thou self-ennobled, and] the
latter clause meaning and be not of those who
glory in old and wasted and crumbling bones,
[i. e. in their ancestors,] (TA,) alluding to his
saying, [so in the S and K and TA, but correctly
the saying of En-Nábighah, (see Har p. 297,)]
نَفْسُ عِصَامٍ سَوَّدَتْ عِصَامَا
وَعَلَّمَتْهُ الكَرَّ وَالإِقْدَامَا
[The soul of 'Isám ennobled 'Isám, and taught him
the art of attack, and boldness]. (S, K, TA.)
And [hence] one says also, فُلَانٌ عِصَامِىٌّ وَعِظَامِىٌّ
i. e. Such a one is noble in respect of soul, or self,
and of origin. (A, TA.)
عَاصِمٌ [act. part. n. of عَصَمَ, signifying] Defending [&c.], or a defender [&c.]. (TA.) لَا
عَاصِمَ اليَوْمَ مِنْ أَمْرِاللّٰهِ, in the Kur [xi. 45], may
mean There is no defender [this day from the
decree of God]: (TA:) or the meaning may be,
no [person] defended: or no possessor of defence:
(S, TA:) so that عاصم may be an instance of
فَاعِل in the sense of مَفْعُوا: (S:) or it may thus
be a possessive epithet. (TA. [See also دَافِقٌ.])
―
-b2-  [Hence,] العَاصِمَةُ is a name of El-Medeeneh.
(K.) ―
-b3-  أَبُو عَاصِمٍ is an appellation of The meal

أَعْصَمُ A gazelle, and a mountain-goat, having
in his arms, (As, T, S, K,) or in one of them,
(AO, S, M, K,) a whiteness, (S, K,) the rest of
him being red or black: (K:) or a goat white in
the fore legs, or in the fore leg: (Az, TA:) fem.
عَصْمَآءُ: (S, K:) and pl. عُصْمٌ. (S.) ―
-b2-  And A
horse white in the fore leg: (As, TA:) or having
a whiteness in one of his fore legs, above the pastern: (ISh, TA:) or having a whiteness in his
fore shanks: (Ham p. 18:) or having a whiteness
in one of his fore legs, (S, TA,) but not in his hind
legs, (TA,) little or much; in which case he is termed
أَعْصَمُ اليُمْنَى or اليُسْرَى [white in respect of the
right fore leg or of the left]: when the whiteness is
in both of his fore legs, he is termed أَعْصَمُ اليَدَيْنِ
[white in respect of the two fore legs]; unless having
a blaze in his face, in which case he is termed
مُحَجَّلٌ, not أَعْصَمُ; (S, TA;) though a blaze
in his face does not cause him to be termed
مُحَجَّلٌ when the whiteness is in one fore leg.
(S.) ―
-b3-  And A crow having a white feather in its
wing; (S, K; [in some copies of the K, in its
two wings;]) i. e., in one of its wings: (TA:)
because the wing of the bird corresponds to the
fore leg [of the beast]: (S, TA:) or white in the
wings: (ISh, IAth, TA:) or white in the legs:
(TA:) or red (أَحْمَر) in the legs and beak; (Az,
K, TA;) and this is said by Az to be the correct
explanation; [but] he adds that the Arabs term
بَيَاض [i. e. whiteness] حَمْرَة [which properly signifies redness], saying of a woman of white complexion that she is حَمْرَآء: [so that by the last of
the foregoing explanations of أَعْصَمُ applied to a
crow is app. meant white in the legs and beak:]
the Prophet is said to have explained this epithet,
thus applied, as meaning of which one of the legs
is white: (TA:) some say that الغُرَابُ الأَعْصَمُ is
like الأَبْلَقُ العَقُوقُ and بَيْضُ الأَنوقِ, applied to
anything that is rarely found: (S, TA:) it occurs
in a number of trads.; and a righteous woman
is likened thereto. (TA.)
مِعْصَمٌ The part, of the fore arm, which is the
place of the bracelet; (S, Msb, K;) [the wrist:
pl. مَعَاصِمُ:] in a citation from a poet (voce عَرَقَ),
المَعَاصِيم is used by poetic license for المَعَاصِم.
(L in art. عرق.) ―
-b2-  And The يَد [meaning arm];
(K, TA;) used in this sense in a verse of ElAashà. (TA.)

ال, a name for The she-goat; which is called to
be milked by one's saying مِعْصَمْ مِعْصَمْ, with the
last letter quiescent. (K.)
