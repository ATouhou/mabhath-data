عذر1
عَذَرَهُ, aor.
عَذِرَ, inf. n. عُذْرٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and
عُذُرٌ (S, O, K) and عُذْرَى (O, K) and مَعْذِرَةٌ and
مَعْذُرَةٌ (K) [all of which are also used as simple
substs.]; and ↓ اعذرهُ; (S, O, Msb, K;) He
excused him; freed, cleared, or exempted, him
from blame; exculpated him: (Msb:) or he
accepted his excuse: properly, عَذَرْتُ signifies
I cancelled evil conduct. (TA.) [See also عُذْرٌ
below.] You say, عَذَرْتُهُ فِيمَا صَنَعَ (S, O, Msb)
I excused, or exculpated, him for what he did.
(Msb.) And in a trad. of El-Mikdád it is said,
اللّٰهُ إِلَيْكَ ↓ لَقَدْ أَعْذَرَ i.e. Verily God hath excused
thee, and exempted thee from the obligation to
fight against the unbelievers; for he had become
extremely fat, and unable to fight. (TA.) And
you say [also], عَذَرَهُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ He excused him
for, or from, the thing. (MA.) [And accord.
to Golius,عَذَرَهُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ, as well as فِى الشَّىْءِ:
but he has not mentioned his authority: see an
explanation of عَذِيرٌ, from which the former
phrase was perhaps derived by him.] And عَذَرْتُهُ
مِنْ فُلَانٍ [I excused him, or held him excusable,
for his conduct to such a one]; meaning, I did
not blame him, but I blamed such a one. (S, *
TA.) And مَنْ يَعْذِرُنِى مِنْهُ Who will excuse me,
or make my excuse, if I requite him (Msb, TA)
for his action, (Msb,) or for his evil action,
(TA,) and will not blame me (Msb, TA) for it?
(Msb:) or who will excuse me with respect to
his case, and will not blame me for it? (Msb.)
[And a similar ex. is mentioned in the TA with
فِى in the place of مِنْ.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,] عَذَرَ, (Az,
S, IKtt, O, Msb, K,) aor.
عَذِرَ; (O, TA;) and ↓ اعذر,
(S, IKtt, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِعْذَارٌ; (TA;) He was
vitious, or faulty, and corrupt: (Msb:) or he
was guilty of many crimes, sins, faults, offences,
or acts of disobedience, (S, O, Msb, K,) so as to
vender him excusable who punished him. (TA.)
It is said in a trad., لَنْ يَهْلِكَ النَّاسُ حَتَّى يَعْذِرُوا
مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ, (O, and so in some copies of the S
and K,) or ↓ يُعْذِرُوا, (so in other copies of the S
and K, ) both of which readings are the same in
meaning, (TA,) i. e. [Men will not perish, or
die,] until they are guilty of many crimes, or sins,
&c.; (S, O, Msb, K;) meaning, (accord. to
A 'Obeyd, S, O,) until they deserve punishment,
so as to render excusable him who punishes them.
(S, A, O, TA.) And you say, مِنْ نَفْسِهِ ↓ اعذر,
meaning He placed himself within the power of
another. (TA.)
-A2-  And عَذَرْتُهُ I aided him, or
assisted him, against an enemy. (Msb.)
-A3-  عَذَرَ,
inf. n. عَذْرٌ, He cut, or cut off. (TA: but only
the inf. n. of the verb in this sense is there mentioned.) ―
-b2-  And [hence, probably, as is implied
in a passage in the TA, (see عُذْرَةٌ,)] عَذَرَ, aor.
عَذِرَ,
(S, O, * Msb, K) inf. n. عَذْرٌ; (S, Msb;) and
↓ اعذر; (S, O, Msb, K;) both as expl. by
A 'Obeyd; (S;) (tropical:)  He circumcised a boy, (S, O,
Msb, K,) and in like manner a girl; (S, O, Msb;)
but when a girl is the object, خَفَضَ is more common. (S, O.)
-A4-  عَذَرَ الفَرَسَ بِالعِذَارِ, aor.
عَذِرَ and
عَذُرَ; and ↓ اعذرهُ; He fastened, or bound, the
horse's عِذَار [q. v.]: (S, O, K:) and الفَرَسَ ↓ اعذر
he bridled the horse; syn. أَلْجَمَهُ; (K, TA;) as
also عَذَرَهُ, and ↓ عذّرهُ: (TA:) or ↓ اعذرهُ, (K,)
or ↓ عذّرهُ, (thus in the TA,) he put to him [or
upon him] an عِذَار; (K, TA;) and so عَذَرَهُ,
aor.
عَذِرَ and
عَذُرَ, inf. n. عَذْرٌ: (Msb:) and ↓ اعذر
اللِّجَامَ he put to the لجام [i. e. bridle or bit] an
عِذَار. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And it is said in the Tahdheeb
of IKtt that عَذَرْتُ الفَرَسَ, inf. n. عَذْرٌ, signifies I
cauterized the horse in the place of the عِذَار: ―
-b3-
and also حملت على عذاره [an explanation in
which there seems to be a mistranscription or an
omission, or both; perhaps correctly جَعَلْتُ عَلَى
الفَرَسِ عِذَارَهُ I put upon the horse his عذار; a
meaning given above]; and ↓ أَعْذَرْتُهُ is a dial.
var. thereof. (TA.) ―
-b4-  عُذِرَ said of a camel
means He was branded with the mark called
عِذَار. (TA.) ―
-b5-  [Hence, app., the phrase عَذَرَهُ
بِاللَّوْمِ (assumed tropical:)  He branded him with blame; like خَطَمَهُ
باللوم, q.v.]
-A5-  عَذَرَهُ, from العُذْرَةُ, He (God, S)
caused him (i. e. a child, TA) to be affected with
the pain, in the fauces, termed عُذْرَة: and عُذِرَ
He was, or became, affected therewith: (S, K, *
TA:) inf. n. عَذْرٌ and عُذْرَةٌ. (IKtt, TA.)
2
عذّر, inf. n. تَعْذِيرٌ, He was without excuse;
(K, * TA;) as also ↓ عاذر, (K, TA,) inf. n. مُعَاذَرَةٌ:
(TA:) he affected to excuse himself, but had no
excuse: he excused himself, but did not adduce an
excuse [that was valid]. (TA.) [See also 8.] ―
-b2-
And He was remiss, wanting, deficient, or defective, (S, O, Msb, TA,) in an affair, (S, Msb,)
setting up an excuse [for being so]; (O;) fell
short, or did less than was incumbent on him,
(S, O, Msb, TA,) in it; (S, Msb;) did not exert
himself, or act vigorously, in it; (Msb, TA;)
causing it to be imagined that he had an excuse
when he had none. (Bd in ix. 91.) You say,
قَامَ فُلَانٌ قِيَامَ تَعْذِيرٍ Such a one acted remissly,
falling short, or doing less than was incumbent
on him. (TA.) And it is said in a story of the
Children of Israel, نَهَاهُمْ أَحْبَارُهُمْ تَعْذِيرًا Their
learned men forbade them remissly: the inf. n.
being here put in the place of the act. part. n. as
a denotative of state; as it is in جَآءَ مَشْيًا. (O,
TA.) [See also 4.]
-A2-  Also (tropical:)  He made, or prepared, a feast, (O, K,) such as is termed إِعْذَار
[q. v.] (O) or عِذَار: (K:) and he invited to a
feast such as is thus termed. (K. [Accord. to
the TA, these are two distinct significations of
the verb. See, again, 4.])
-A3-  عذّر الفَرَسَ: see 1,
latter half, in two places. ―
-b2-  عَذِّرْ عَنِّى بَعِيرَكَ,
(S, O,) and عَنِّى ↓ أَعْذِرْهُ, (O,) Brand thy camel
with a brand different from that of mine, in
order that our camels may be known, one from
the other. (S, O.) ―
-b3-  عذّر الغُلَامُ The hair of the
boy's عِذَار (K, TA) i. e. of his cheek (TA) grew.
(K, TA.)
-A4-  عذّر الدَّارَ (inf. n. as above, TA)
He effaced the traces of the house, or dwelling.
(K, TA.)
-A5-  عذّرهُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. as above,
(S, O,) He defiled, or besmeared, it (a thing, K)
with عَذِرَة [or human dung]. (S, O, K.)
3
عَاْذَرَ see 2, first sentence. [And see also the
last clause of the last paragraph of this art.]
4
اعذر: see 1, in five places from the commencement. ―
-b2-  Also He had an excuse; [or he
was, or became, excusable;] (S, O, K;) and so
↓ اعتذر. (S, O, K.) It is said in a prov., أَعْذَرَ
مَنْ أَنْذَرَ [He has an excuse, or is excusable, who
warns]. (S. [See also below: and see art. نذر.
It is held by some in the present day that the ا
in اعذر, in this phrase, has a privative effect, and
that the meaning is, He deprives of excuse who
warns: but for this I have not found any
authority.]) And Lebeed says, (S, O, TA,)
addressing his two daughters, (O, TA,) and
telling them to wail and weep a year for him
after his death, (TA,)
إِلَى الحَوْلِ ثُمَّ اسْمُ السَّلَامِ عَلَيْكُمَا
↓ وَمَنْ يَبْكِ حَوْلًا كَامِلًا فَقَدْ اعْتَذَرْ
[Until the end of the year: then the name of
peace be an you both: for such as weeps a whole
year has become excusable]. (S, O.) You say
also, أَعْذَرْتُ عِنْدَ السُّلْطَانِ I got excuse of the
Sultán [or ruling power]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And He
manifested an excuse: (K, TA:) in which sense,
عُذْرٌ is said to be its inf. n., as well as إِعْذَارٌ; but
the former is correctly a simple subst. (TA.)
And He pleaded that by which he should be
excused. (TA.) [See also 8.] ―
-b4-  He did that
by which he should be excused. (TA.) ―
-b5-  He did
that in which he should be excused: hence the
saying of Zuheyr,
*سَتَمْنَعُكُمْ أَرْمَاحُنَا أَوْ سَنُعْذِرُ
[Our spears shall prevent you, or shall defend
you,] or we will do that in which we shall be
excused. (S, O: but in the latter, وَتَمْنَعُكُمْ.) ―
-b6-
And He exceeded the usual bounds, (A, Mgh, O,)
or went to the utmost point, (TA,) in excuse, (A,
Mgh, O, TA,) i. e. in being excused. (A.) So
in the saying أَعْذَرَ مَنْ أَنْذَرَ [He exceeds the usual
bounds in rendering himself excused who warns].
(A, Mgh, O. [See also above, third sentence.])
And it is said in a trad., لَقَدْ أَعْذَرَ اللّٰهُ إِلَى مَنْ
بَلَغَ مِنَ العُمُرِ سِتِّينَ سَنَةً [app. meaning Verily
God hath freed himself from the imputation of
injustice to an extraordinary degree, or to the
utmost point, to him who hath attained sixty
years of age:] i. e. He hath left him no plea for
excuse [for his sins], since He hath granted him
respite for all this length of time and he hath not
excused himself. (TA. [As اعذر is here followed
by إِلَى, I do not think that this explanation is
meant to show that the ا has a privative effect, and
that the verb signifies “ he deprived of excuse. ”])
―
-b7-  [Hence,] He exerted himself, acted vigorously, took extraordinary pains, or exceeded the
usual bounds, [so as to render himself excused,] (S,
O, Msb, K, TA,) فِى الأَمْرِ in the affair; (S, O,
Msb;) as, for instance, in eating, in relation to
which it occurs in a trad., wherein one is enjoined
to do so when eating with others, [app. meaning
with guests and with a host,] such having been
the custom of the Prophet; for, when he ate
with others, he was the last in eating. (TA.)
[Hence also,] أَعْذَرْتُ إِلَيْكَ I took extraordinary
pains, or exceeded the usual bounds, in exhortation
and precept to thee. (TA.) ―
-b8-  And He was
remiss, wanting, deficient, or defective; he fell
short, or did less than was incumbent on him;
feigning (يُرِى [in the CK, erroneously, يُرىٰ])
that he was doing the contrary: as though the
verb bore two contrary significations. (K.) [See
also 2.]
-A2-  Also I. q. أَنْصَفَ: (O, K:) you say,
أَعْذِرْنِى مِنْ هٰذَا i. e. أَنْصِفْنِى مِنْهُ [Give thou me,
or obtain for me, my right, or due, from this
person]: and hence the saying of the Prophet to
Aboo-Bekr, respecting 'Áïsheh, أَعْذِرْنِى مِنْهَا إِنْ
أَدَّبْتُهَا [Obtain thou for me my right, or due, from
her if I discipline her, or chastise her]: (O:) or
this means undertake thou to excuse me [for my
conduct to her &c.]: (TA:) and the Arabs say,
أَعْذَرَ فُلَانٌ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ [Such a one became bound to
render an excuse for his conduct to himself; (see
عَذِيرٌ;)] meaning such a one was destroyed by
himself. (Yoo, TA.)
-A3-  As signifying He circumcised: see 1, latter half. It is said in a trad.,
كُنَّا إِعْذَارَ يَوْمٍ وَاحِدٍ, meaning We were circumcised in one day. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  He made a
feast on the occasion of a circumcision, (AZ,
Msb, K, TA,) لِلْقَوْمِ for the people, or party:
(K:) he prepared such a feast: from the same
verb signifying “ he circumcised. ” (TA.) [See
also 2: and see إِعْذَارٌ as a subst.]
-A4-  اعذر الفَرَسَ
and اللِّجَامَ: see 1, latter half, in five places. ―
-b2-
And أَعْذِرْ عَنِّى بَعِيرَكَ: see 2, near the end. ―
-b3-
أَعْذِرْ عَلَى نَصِيبِكَ Make a mark upon thy share.
(O.) ―
-b4-  اعذر فِى ظَهْرِهِ He beat him (O, K) with
whips (O) so as to make a mark, or marks, upon
his back. (O, K.) And ضَرَبَهُ حَتَّى أَعْذَرَ مَتْنَهُ
He beat him so that he made the beating heavy
upon his back and obtained from him relief from
his anger. (TA.) And ضُرِبَ فَأُعْذِرَ, (S, O, K,)
in the Tahdheed of IKtt فَأَعْذَرَ, (TA,) He (a man)
was beaten so that he was at the point of death.
(S, O, K, TA.) And أُعْذِرَ مِنْهُ He had wounds inflicted upon him so that fear was excited for him
in consequence thereof. (O.) And أَعْذَرَ بِهِ He,
or it, left a scar upon him. (O, * TA.) ―
-b5-  And
أَعْذَرْتُ الدَّارَ and فِى الدَّارِ I made a mark, or
marks, in, or upon, the house, or dwelling. (O.)
-A5-  اعذر also signifies He (a man, TA) voided
his ordure. (O, K.) ―
-b2-  And اعذرت الدَّارُ The
house, or dwelling, had in it much عَذِرَة [or human
ordure]. (S, O.)
5
تعذّر: see 8, in three places. ―
-b2-  Also He
went backwards; drew back; remained behind;
or held back: (K:) or he held back, or withheld
himself, for a cause rendering him excused. (TA
voce تَغَدَّرَ, q. v.) ―
-b3-  And He fled. (K.) You
say, تعذّروا عَلَيْهِ They fled from him, and abstained from aiding, or assisting, him, or held
back from him. (O.) ―
-b4-  And He resisted, and
was difficult: it is said in a trad., [respecting
Mohammad,] كَانَ يَتَعَذَّرُ فِى مَرَضِهِ He used to
resist, and be difficult, in his malady. (TA.) ―
-b5-
And تعذّر الأَمْرُ (O, K, TA) The affair was not
direct in its tendency; (K, TA;) i. e. (TA) it
was, or became, difficult: one says, تعذّر عَلَيْهِ
الأَمْرُ The affair was, or became, difficult to him.
(O, Msb, TA.) [And The affair was, or became, impracticable, or impossible.]
-A2-  تعذّر الرَّسْمُ
The رسم [i. e. trace, or relic, of an abode, or of a
place of sojourning, &c.,] became effaced; (S, O,
K;) as also ↓ اعتذر: (S, *, O, * K:) or became
altered and effaced: and المَنَازِلُ ↓ اعتذرت the
places of alighting, or abode, had their traces, or
remains, effaced. (TA.)
-A3-  And تعذّر (from
العَذِرَةُ, S, O) He, or it, became defiled, or besmeared, (S, O, K) with عَذِرَة [or human ordure].
(K.)
8
اعتذر, (S, O, Msb, &c.,) inf. n. اِعْتِذَارٌ, (S,
O, TA,) and [quasi-inf. ns.] ↓ عِذْرَةٌ and ↓ مَعْذِرَةٌ;
(TA;) and for اعتذر one says also اِعَذَّرَ, aor.
يَعَذِّرُ, inf. n. اِعِذَّارٌ; and it is allowable to say
اِعِذِّرَ, aor. يَعِذِّرُ; but the former of these two
variations is the more approved; (AHeyth, TA;)
[in the former case, the original being changed to
اِعَتْذَرَ, then to اِعَذْذَرَ, then to اِعَذَّرَ; and in the
latter case, to اِعْتْذَرَ, then to اِعِتْذَرَ, then to اِعِذْذَرَ,
then to اِعِذْرَ, and then to اِعِذِّرَ;] He excused himself; he adduced, or urged, an excuse, or a plea,
for himself; (Fr, S, * O, * TA;) as also ↓ تعذّر.
(S, O, K.) [See عُذْرٌ.] You say, اعتذر إِلَىَّ [He
excused himself to me;] he begged me to accept his
excuse; (Msb;) and AZ says, I have heard two
Arabs of the desert, one of the tribe of Temeem
and one of the tribe of Keys, say, إِلَى ↓ تَعَذَّرْتُ
الرَّجُلِ in the sense of اِعْتَذَرْتُ [i. e. I excused
myself to the man]. (TA.) And اعتذر مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ
(S, * O, * TA) and ↓ تعذّر (TA) [He excused himself, or urged an excuse, for his crime, sin, or
misdeed: or] he asserted himself to be clear of
his crime, sin, or misdeed. (TA.) And اعتذر
عَنْ فِعْلِهِ [or مِنْ فعله] He showed, or manifested,
his excuse for his deed. (Msb.) [It is said that]
the primary meaning of الاِعْتِذَارُ is The cutting a
man off from the object of his want, and from
that to which he clings in his heart. (TA.)
[Hence, perhaps, one says اعتذر meaning He
excused himself for not complying with a claim,
or request.] ―
-b2-  See also 4, in two places, near
the beginning. ―
-b3-  Also He did not adduce an
excuse. (Fr, TA.) [Thus it has two contr. significations. See also 2.]
-A2-  Also He complained,
(O, Msb, K,) مِنْهُ of him, or it. (Msb.)

10
استعذر مِنْ فُلَانٍ He asked, or desired, to
be excused if he should lay violent hands upon
such a one [or requite him for an evil action]; he
said, مَنْ عَذِيرِى مِنْ فُلَانٍ. (A, TA.) It is said
in a trad. of the Prophet, اِسْتَعْذَرَ أَبَا بَكْرٍ مِنْ
عَائِشَةَ i. e. He said to Aboo-Bekr, Undertake
thou to excuse me for my conduct to 'Áïsheh if I
discipline her, or chastise her. (O, * TA.) ―
-b2-
And one says to him who has neglected the
giving information of a thing, (A, TA,) or to
him who reproves thee for a thing before giving
thee any command, or order, or injunction, respecting it, (O, TA,) وَاللّٰهِ مَا اسْتَعْذَرْتَ إِلَىَّ وَلَا
اسْتَنْذَرْتَ By God, thou didst not offer to me
excuse, nor didst thou offer warning. (A, O,
TA.)
عُذْرٌ (Msb, K) and ↓ عُذُرٌ (Msb) and ↓ عِذْرَةٌ

(S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ مَعْذُرَةٌ and ↓ مَعْذَرَةٌ (K)
[all as simple substs., but all except the third
and the last mentioned also as inf. ns.,] An
excuse; an apology; a plea whereby one excuses
himself [or another]: accord. to the B, عُذْرٌ [as a
subst. from اِعْتَذَرَ or from أَعْذَرَ] is of three kinds;
the saying “ I did it not; ” and the saying “ I did
it for such a cause,” mentioning what might
exempt him from being culpable; and the saying
“ I did it, but will not do it again,” or the like;
which third kind is the same as تَوْبَةٌ: (TA:) the
pl. of عُذْرٌ is أَعْذَارٌ; (Msb, K;) and that of ↓ عِذْرَةٌ
is عِذَرٌ; (O;) and that of ↓ معذرة is [مَعَاذِرُ, and,
irregularly,] مَعَاذِيرُ: (TA:) and ↓ عَذِيرٌ, of which
عُذْرٌ, (Ksh,) or ↓ عُذُرٌ, (Bd,) may be pl., is syn.
with [عُذْرٌ and] معذرة; (Ksh and Bd in lxxvii. 6;)
and ↓ مِعْذَارٌ is [likewise] syn. with عُذْرٌ. (Bd in
lxxv. 15.) It is said in a prov., مَكَاذِبُ ↓ المَعَاذِرُ
[Excuses are lies]. (TA.) And it was said by
Ibráheem En-Nakha'ee, يَشُوبُهَا ↓ إِنَّ المَعَاذِيرَ
الكَذِبُ [Verily excuses, lying mixes therewith].
(S, O.) ―
-b2-  عُذْرًا أَوْ نُذْرًا, in the Kur [lxxvii. 6],
or أَوْ نُذُرًا, ↓ عُذُرًا, (Bd,) means For excusing or
terrifying; the two ns. being inf. ns.: or for
excuses or warnings; the two ns. being pls., of
↓ عَذِيرٌ in the sense of معذرة and of نَذِيرٌ in the
sense إِنْذَارٌ: or such as excuse and such as warn;
the two ns. being pls. of ↓ عَاذِرٌ and مُنْذِرٌ: (Ksh,
Bd:) or, accord. to Th, both mean the same.
(TA.) [See also نُذْرٌ.] ―
-b3-  And the Arabs say,
لَا نُذْرَاكَ ↓ عُذْرَاكَ i. e. أَعْذِرْ وَلَا تُنْذِرْ [app. meaning
Do that for which thou wilt be excused, by inflicting punishment when it is deserved, and do not
merely warn, and put in fear]. (TA in art. نذر.)
-A2-  عُذْرٌ also signifies Success; or the attainment,
or accomplishment, of one's wants, or of a thing:
(IAar, O, K:) and victory, or success in a contest. (O, K.) One says, with respect to a war
or a battle, لِمَنَ العُذْرُ Whose is the success, or
victory? (O.)
-A3-  See also عُذْرَةٌ, in five places:
and see عِذَارٌ, last quarter.

with ة, mentioned]. دَارٌ عَذِرَةٌ means A house, or
dwelling, of which there are many traces, or relics.
(O.) ―

عِذَارٌ [q. v.]. (S, O, Msb, K.)
عُذْرَةٌ The virginity, maidenhead, or hymen;
syn. بَكَارَةٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) or قِضَّةٌ; so called
from عَذْرٌ signifying the “ act of cutting,” because
a girl's hymen (خَاتَمُ عُذْرَتِهَا) is rent when she is
devirginated; (Lh, Az, TA;) العُذْرَةُ being that
whereby a girl is a virgin: (Lh, TA:) [and
↓ عُذْرٌ perhaps signifies the same: (see an ex.
voce أَرِيمٌ; and see also the next sentence here
following:)] pl. عُذَرٌ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  And Devirgination of a girl [or woman]: (Lh, K:) [and

blame me (Msb, TA) for it? or who will excuse
me with respect to the case of such a one, and not
blame me for it? (Msb: [see عَذَرْتُهُ مِنْ فُلَانٍ:
and see also 10:]) or who will aid me, or assist
me, against such a one, or to defend myself from
him? (Msb;) who will be my aider, or assistant,
against such a one? (TA:) for عَذِيرٌ is also said
to signify an aider, or assister, against an enemy.
(Msb, K, TA.) The Prophet said thus with
respect to 'Abd-Allah Ibn-Ubeí, demanding of
the people that they should excuse him for laying
violent hands upon him. (TA.) [It is a phrase
by which one asks for permission to retaliate, or
punish, &c.] And one says also, عَذِيرَكَ مِنْ فُلَانٍ,
meaning Bring him who will excuse thee [for
what thou hast done, or doest, or wilt do, to such
a one]; (S, O, TA;) i. e. bring him who will
blame him and will not blame thee. (S, O.) And
عَذيرَكَ إِيَّاىَ مِنْهُ Bring thine excuse of me [for
what I have done, &c., to him]. (TA.) A poet

نَ كَانُوا حَيَّةَ الأَرْضِ
بَغَى بَعْضٌ عَلَى بَعْضٍ
فَلَمْ يَرْعُوْا عَلَى بَعْضِ

Arabes by Caussin de Perceval, vol. ii. p. 262;)
therefore we may render the phrase, bring an
excuse for the tribe, 'Adwán, regarding مِنْ as
redundant in this instance, like as it is in فَاجْتَنِبُوا
الرِّجْسَ مِنَ الْأَوْثَانِ, in the Kur xxii. 31; and
then proceed thus: they were the serpent of the
earth (meaning cunning, guileful, malignant, or
mischievous, and strong, not neglecting to take
blood-revenge, as expl. in art. حى in the TA):
but some acted wrongfully against some, and were
not regardful of the rights of some: so they became
subjects of talk uttered by the raising of speech
and the lowering thereof]: he means, bring an
excuse for what some of them have done to some
by mutual hatred and slaughter, some of them
being not regardful of some; after their having
been the serpent of the earth, which every one
fears. (L, TA.) ―

journey which he had determined to make, asked
him, “What is this that thou repairest ? ” (TA,)

-b2-  and also, (K, TA,) in the dial. of El-Yemen,
(TA,) Veils, curtains, or coverings. (O, K, TA.)
The saying in the Kur [lxxv. 14 and 15], بَلِ
الْإِنْسَانُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ is expl.
as meaning [Nay, the man shall be witness against
himself, though he throw] his veils or coverings
[over his offences]: (TA:) or (accord. to Mujá-
hid, S, O), [though he offer his excuses; or]
though he dispute respecting it (S, O, TA) with
every plea by which he may excuse himself.
(TA.)
مَعْذُورٌ Excused; freed, cleared, or exempted,
from blame; exculpated. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  And [hence,
perhaps,] مَعْذُورَةٌ applied to a woman signifies
مُسْتَحَاضَةٌ [q. v. in art. حيض]: and sometimes
one says ↓ عَاذِرَةٌ; as meaning having an excuse:
(Msb:) the latter is said to be used in the sense
of مُسْتَحَاضَةٌ; but it requires consideration; (O,
TA;) as though it were of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ in
the sense of مَفْعُولَةٌ, [i. e. in the sense of مَعْذُورَةٌ
as meaning excused,] from إِقَامَةُ العُذْرِ. (TA.)
―
-b3-  [Golius assigns to مَعْذُورٌ the meaning of
“ Voti impos; ” as on the authority of the KL;
in which, however, I do not find it.]
-A2-  Also
(tropical:)  Circumcised. (S, A, O, Msb.)
-A3-  And A camel
branded with the mark called عِذَار. (TA.)
-A4-
And [A child] affected with the pain, of the
fauces, termed عُذْرَة. (S, O, K.)
مُعَاذِرٌ: see its pl. in the last clause of the following paragraph.
مُعْتَذِرٌ One excusing himself, whether he have,
or have not, an excuse: (TA:) the person to
whom this epithet is applied may be a speaker of
truth, and he may be not a speaker of truth:
(Msb, TA:) and so ↓ مُعَذِّرٌ, which, as applied to
a speaker of truth, signifies having an excuse,
like مُعْتَذِرٌ, (S, O, K,) [of which it is a variation,]
for the ت is changed into ذ, and this is incorporated [into the radical ذ], and its vowel is
transferred to the ع, like as is the case in
يَخَصِّمُونَ; (S, O;) and ↓ مُعِذِّرٌ is also allowable,
(S, O, TA,) and also ↓ مُعُذِّرٌ; (S, O;) but [it is
said that] ↓ مُعَذِّرٌ applied to him who does not
speak truth, (S, O, K,) being [originally] of the
measure مُفَعِّلٌ, [not a variation of مُعْتَذِرٌ,] (S, O,)
means falling short, or doing less than is incumbent on him, (S, O, K,) excusing himself (S, O)
without having any [real or valid] excuse. (S,
O, K.) In the Kur ix. 91, I'Ab read ↓ المُعْذِرُونَ
[instead of the more usual reading ↓ المُعَذِّرُونَ],
(S, O, K,) and so did Yaakoob El-Hadramee,
(Az, TA,) from أَعْذَرَ; the former asserting that
it was so revealed; app. considering ↓ مُعَذِّرٌ,
with teshdeed, to apply to one not speaking
truth, (S, O, K,) meaning pretending to excuse
himself, without having any real excuse; (S, O;)
and ↓ مُعْذِرٌ to mean having an excuse: (S, O, K:)
Ibn-Abee-Leylà and Tá-oos read ↓ المُعَاذِرُونَ, as
meaning those striving, or labouring, in seeking
excuse. (O.)
