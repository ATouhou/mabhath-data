[from the agency, or administration, or government]. (S, O, TA.) And ↓ عزّلهُ, (K, TA,) inf. n.

[In like manner also اعزل is said by Freytag
to signify Semovit, followed by عن, as on the
authority of the K; in which I do not find it.]
And عُزِلَ He was, or became, removed deposed,
or displaced, [from his office, &c.,] (S, O, Msb,)
used as quasi-pass. of عَزَلَهُ; in which sense ↓ انعزل
is [said to be] not used, because in it [i. e. عَزَلَهُ] no
labour, or exertion, is implied. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  عَزَلَ
said of the مُجَامِع means Paulò ante emissionem,
[penem suum] extraxit, et extra vulvam semen

اعتزلهُ and ↓ تعزّلهُ both signify the same, (S,
O, TA,) i. e. He went apart, away, or aside;
removed; or separated himself; from him, or it:
(O, TA:) and so اعتزل عَنْهُ and عنه ↓ تعزّل: (TA:)

or aside; removed; or separated myself; from
men, or the people; [withdrew from association,
or communion, with them; seceded from them;]
and left, forsook, or quitted, them: and both
verbs are sometimes used intransitively: (Msb:)
[i. e.] اعتزل and ↓ تعزّل [used alone sometimes]
signify he went apart, away, or aside; &c.; as
also ↓ انعزل: (K, TA: [the last omitted in this
place in the CK; but mentioned afterwards, voce
تعازلوا:]) and they said, عَنِ النَّاسِ ↓ انعزل meaning he went apart, or aside, from men, or the
people: (Msb:) and one says, of a pastor, يَعْتَزِلُ
مِنَ النَّاسِ ↓ بِمَاشِيَتِهِ وَيَرْعَاهَا بِمَعْزِلٍ [He goes apart,
or aside, with his cattle, and pastures them in a
place remote, or separate, from men, or the people].
(S, O.) وَ إِنْ لَمْ تُؤْمِنُوا لِىْ فَاعْتَزِلُونِ, in the Kur
[xliv. 20], means, accord. to Ibn-'Arafeh, [And if
ye believe me not,] leave me on equal terms, not being against me nor for me. (O.) [And you say,
اعتزلهُ إِلَى غَيْرِهِ He withdrew himself from him to
another: see Har p. 245.] And اِعْتَزَلَهَا, expl.
above, as syn. with عَزَلَ عَنْهَا: see 1. And يَعْتَزِلُ
الحَرْبَ [He withholds himself, or keeps aloof, from
war, or battle]: said of him who has no weapon.
(TA.)
عَزْلٌ What is brought to the treasury of the state
in advance, not weighed, nor picked so as to have
the bad put forth from it, to the time of the falling-due of the instalment: (O, K, TA:) [for the
second of the last three words of the explanation,
which are correctly إِلَى مَحِلِّ النَّجْمِ, the O has
محَلِ; the CK, مَحَلِّ; and my MS. copy of the
K, محل, without any vowel-sign and without
the sheddeh:] from Ibn-'Abbád; (O;) and thus
in the L. (TA.)
عُزْلٌ: see the next paragraph.
عَزَلٌ inf. n. of عَزِلَ [q. v.]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also The
state, or condition, of not having with one any
weapon; and so ↓ عُزْلٌ: (K, TA: [the latter,
by reason of an ambiguity in the K, misunderstood by Freytag as syn. with عِزَالٌ in the sense
in which this is expl. in the CK:]) they are two
dial. vars., like شَغَلٌ and شُغْلٌ, and بَخَلٌ and
بُخْلٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And A deficiency in one of the
حَرْقَفَتَانِ [app. meaning, in the crest of one of the
two hip-bones]. (IAar, O, K.) ―
-b4-  And The hinder
part of an ass: so in the saying, اِقْرَعْ عَزَلَ حِمَارِكَ
[Strike thou the binder part of thy ass]: (O, K:)
said to the driver of the ass. (O.)
عُزُلٌ: see أَعْزَلُ, in three places.
عُزْلَةٌ a subst. (S, Msb) signifying A going apart.
away, or aside; removal, or separation of oneself;
(S, * L, Msb, * K;) [a withdrawing of oneself from
association or communion; or secession: and it
seems to be sometimes used in a sense similar to
that of اِعْتِكَافٌ; for] one says, العُزْلَةُ عِبَادَةٌ [app.
meaning Retirement, or self-seclusion, is a mode of
religious service]. (S, L, TA.)
العَزَلَةُ The حَرْقَفَة [app. meaning the crest of
the hip-bone]. (K.)
عَزْلَآءُ [originally fem. of أَعْزَلُ; a subst. signifying] The lower mouth [or spout or outlet] of the
[leathern water-bag called] مَزَادَة; (S, Mgh, O,
Msb;) the part where the water pours forth from
the رَاوِيَة [a word here, as in many other instances, used as syn. with مَزَادَة,] and the like of
this, (K, TA,) such [for instance] as the قِرْبَة, in
the bottom thereof, where the water contained in it
is drawn forth: Kh says that to every مزادة there
are عَزْلَاوَانِ [dual of عَزْلَآءُ], in the bottom thereof;
but it is said in the M that the عزلآء is thus called
because it is in one of the خُصْمَان [meaning the
two lower corners] of the مزادة; not in its middle;
nor is it like its mouth, in which it receives the
water: (TA:) [the mouth, by means of which
this kind of water-bag is filled, is in the middle
of the upper edge; and the عزلآء, in every instance that I remember to have seen, is in the
binder of the two lower corners, and is tied
round with a thong: (see مَزَادَةٌ in art. زيد:)]
the pl. is عَزَالٍ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, * written with
the article العَزَالِى, and in the K [improperly]
عَزَالِى without the article,) and عَزَالَى also (S, O,
Msb, K) is allowable; (S, O;) and ↓ العَزَائِلُ
occurs in a trad. for العَزَالِى; these two words
being like الشَّائِكُ and الشَّاكِى. (TA.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] El-Kumeyt says, [describing clouds
(سَحَاب),]
مَرَتْهُ الجَنُوبُ فَلَمَّا اكْفَهَرْ
رَ حَلَّتْ عَزَالِيَهُ الشَّمْأَلُ
(assumed tropical:)  [The south wind drew them forth; and when
they became black and dense and accumulated, the
north wind loosed their spouts; i. e. caused the
rain to pour forth]. (S, O.) And one says of a
cloud (سَحَابَة), (Mgh, TA,) when it discharges
its pouring [rain], (Mgh,) or when it pours forth
copious rain, (TA,) أَرْخَتْ عَزَالِيَهَا (tropical:)  [It loosed its
spouts], (Mgh,) or قَدْ حَلَّتْ عَزَالِيَهَا [it has loosed
its spouts], and أَرْسَلَتْ عَزَالِيَهَا, (TA,) which
[means the same and] is said [also] of the sky
(السَّمَآء) by way of indicating the vehement falling
of the rain, this being likened to its descent from
the mouths [meaning spouts] of the مَزَادَة [or
rather of the مَزَاد or مَزَايِد]. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  And
[hence also,] العَزْلَآءُ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The اِسْت [i. e. the
anus; as being an outlet; and as being closed by
means of a sphincter, like as the عزلآء properly
thus termed is closed by means of a thong tied
round it]. (O, K.)
عُزْلَانٌ is a word used by the vulgar in the sense
of عَزْلٌ [app. as inf. n. of عَزَلَهُ, q. v.]. (TA.)
عِزَالٌ Weakness; syn. ضَعْفٌ. (L, K, TA: in
the CK ضَعِيف.)
-A2-  It is also a vulgar term for
The goods, or furniture and utensils, of the house
or tent. (TA.)
العَزَالَانِ [a dual of which the sing. is not mentioned] The two feathers that are at the extremity
of the tail of the eagle: (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K:) pl.
أَعْزِلَةٌ. (Ibn-'Abbád, O.)
العَزَائِلُ, for العَزَالِى: see عَزْلَآءُ.
العُزَّالُ: see المُعْتَزِلَةُ.
أَعْزَلُ Sand (رَمْل) separate, or cut off, (IAar,
O, K,) from other sands. (IAar, O.) ―
-b2-  Also A
man not having with him any weapon; (S, O,
K;) as also ↓ عُزُلٌ, (O, K,) occurring in a trad.;
(O;) and ↓ مِعْزَالٌ, (K,) or this signifies not
having with him a spear; (S, * K;) and the first
is sometimes expl. as having this particular meaning: (TA:) pl. of the first, (S, O, K,) and of
↓ عُزُلٌ, (K, TA,) عُزْلٌ and عُزْلَانٌ and عُزَّلٌ, (S, O,
K,) which is anomalous, but made to accord
with حُسَّرٌ, pl. of the epithet حَاسِرٌ, because nearly
like it in meaning, (R, MF,) and أَعْزَالٌ, (K,) or
or this is pl. of ↓ عُزُلٌ, (O, TA,) and مَعَازِيلُ, (IJ,
K,) which is anomalous, (TA,) and this is pl. of
↓ مِعْزَالٌ (S, O, K) also. (K.) Hence, the epithet الأَعْزَلُ is applied to one of the سِمَاكَانِ, (S,
O, K, TA,) i. e., to one of the two stars of which
each is called السِّمَاكُ [q. v.]; (TA;) because,
unlike [the other سماك, i. e.] الرَّامِحُ, it has no
star [near] before it that is regarded as its weapon;
(S, * O, * K, * TA;) or because in the days of its
rising [aurorally] there is no cold nor wind. (O,
K.) ―
-b3-  And A bird that cannot fly. (MF, TA.)
―
-b4-  And Clouds (سَحَاب) in which is no rain. (S,
O, K.) ―
-b5-  And A horse having his tail inclining
to one side, (S, Mgh, O, K,) by habit, (S, O, K,)
not naturally. (S, O.) [See عَزِلَ.] Hence the
saying, أَعُوذُ بِاللّٰهِ مِنَ الأَعْزَلِ عَلَى الأَعْزَلِ i. e. [I
seek protection by God] from a [or the] man
having with him no weapon, upon a [or the] horse
of which the عَسِيب [or bone of the tail, or part of
the tail where the hair grows,] is crooked. (TA.)
―
-b6-  And [app. as an epithet applied to an ass or
the like,] Deficient in one of the حَرْقَفَتَانِ [which
seems here to mean, in the crest of one of the two
hip-bones]. (IAar, O, K.) ―
-b7-  And The share, of
flesh-meat, of an absent man: (IAar, O, K: *)
pl. عُزْلٌ. (IAar, O.)
مَعْزِلٌ A place of removal, or separation of oneself: so in the saying, كُنْتُ بِمَعْزِلٍ عَنْ كَذَا وَكَذَا
[I was in a place, and hence in a state, of removal, or separation, of myself, from such and
such things; I was aloof therefrom]. (TA.) See
8. وَكَانَ فِى مَعْزِلٍ, in the Kur [xi. 44], means
And he was aloof from the ship [i. e. the ark],
or from the religion of his father. (O, TA.) And
one says, أَنَا عَنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ بِمَعْزِلٍ [I am aloof
from this affair]. (S, O.) And فُلَانٌ عَنِ الحَقِّ
بِمَعْزِلٍ Such a one is aloof from the truth. (Msb.)
مِعْزَالٌ A pastor who goes apart, or aside, with
his cattle, and pastures them in a place remote, or
separate, from men, or the people: (S, O:) or a
pastor apart from others (K, TA) with his camels
depasturing the herbage not previously pastured
upon and seeking successively the places where
rain had fallen: in this sense not an epithet
of discommendation, for the doing thus is an act
of the courageous and valiant of men: (TA:)
pl. مَعَازِيلُ. (S.) ―
-b2-  And One who alights apart,
or aloof, from the company of travellers; (K,
TA; [من السَّفَرِ in the CK should be مِنَ السَّفْرِ;])
who alights by himself; in which sense it is an
epithet of discommendation. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And One
who separates himself from the players at the game
called المَيْسِر, by reason of meanness. (S, O, K.)
―
-b4-  And One who is alone in his opinion, having
no one to share with him in it. (TA.) ―
-b5-  See
also أَعْزَلُ in two places. ―
-b6-  Also Weak and
stupid. (S, O, K.)
مَعْزُولٌ [pass. part. n. of عَزَلَهُ; Put, or set, apart,
away, or aside; &c.]. إِنَّهُمْ عَنِ السَّمْعِ لَمَعْزُولُونَ,
in the Kur [xxvi. 212], means Verily they are
debarred, or precluded, from hearing [the speech
of the angels]. (TA.)
المُعْتَزِلَةُ A sect of the قَدَرِيَّة [q. v.], who asserted
that they seceded from what were in their estimation the two parties of error, the people of the سُنَّة
and خَوَارِج: (O, K:) [therefore they were thus
called, i. e. the Seceders:] or they were thus called
by El-Hasan (K, TA) Ibn-Yesár El-Basree
(TA) when Wásil Ibn-'Atà and his companions
withdrew from him to one of the columns of the
mosque, [agreeably with a common practice of
lecturers in a mosque, each of them seating himself on the ground at the foot of a column, while
his hearers, with him, seated also on the ground,
form a ring,] and he (i. e. Wásil, TA) began to
establish the dictum of the condition between the two
conditions, that the committer of a great sin is not
a believer absolutely (K, TA) nor an unbeliever
absolutely (K, TA, but not in the CK,) but between the two conditions: (K, TA:) and they are
also called ↓ العُزَّالُ. (TA.)
