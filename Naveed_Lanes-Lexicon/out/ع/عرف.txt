عَرَفَهُ, (S, O, Msb, K, &c.,) aor.
عَرِفَ, (O, K,)
inf. n. مَعْرِفَةٌ (S, O, K) and عِرْفَانٌ (S, O, Msb, K)
and عِرِفَّانٌ (K) and عِرْفَةٌ, (Msb, K,) or مَعْرِفَةٌ is a
simple subst., (Msb,) He knew it; he had cognition of it; or he was, or became, acquainted with
it; syn. عَلِمَهُ: (K:) or he knew it (عَلِمَهُ) by
means of any of the five senses; (Msb;) [and also,
by mental perception:] Er-Rághib says, المَعْرِفَةُ
is the perceiving a thing by reflection, and by consideration of the effect thereof [upon the mind or
sense], so that it has a more special meaning than
العِلْمُ, and its contr. is الإِنْكَارُ; and one says, فُلَانٌ
يَعْرِفُ اللّٰهَ وَرَسُولَهُ [Such a one knows God and his
apostle], but one does not say يَعْلَمُ اللّٰهَ, making
the verb [thus] to have a single objective complement, since man's مَعْرِفَة [or knowledge] of God
is [the result of] the consideration of his effects,
without the perception of his essence; and one
says, اَللّٰهُ يَعْلَمُ كَذَا, but not يَعْرِفُ كذا, since
المَعْرِفَةُ is used in relation to عِلْم [or knowledge]
which is defective, to which one attains by reflection: it is from عَرَفْتُهُ meaning I found, or experienced, its عَرْف i. e. odour; or as meaning I
attained its عُرْف i. e. limit: (TA:) it is said in
the B that المَعْرِفَةُ differs from العِلْمُ, in meaning,
in several ways: the former concerns the thing
itself [which is its object;] whereas the latter
concerns the states, or conditions, or qualities,
thereof: also the former generally denotes the
perceiving a thing as a thing that has been absent
from the mind, thus differing from the latter;
therefore the contr. of the former is الإِنْكَارُ, and
the contr. of the latter is الجَهْلُ; and the former
is the knowing a thing itself as distinguished from
other things; whereas the latter concerns a thing
collectively with other things: (TA in art. علم:)
and sometimes they put ↓ اعترف in the place of
عَرَفَ; (S, O;) [i. e.] اعترف الشَّىْءَ signifies عَرَفَهُ:
(Mgh, K:) and so, sometimes, does ↓ استعرفُه.
(Har p. 486.) ―
-b2-  And عَرَفَ is also used in the
place of اعترف [in the first of the senses assigned
to the latter below]. (S, O.) See the latter verb,
in four places. ―
-b3-  عَرَفَهُ also signifies He requited
him. (O, K.) Ks read, (O, K,) and so five
others, (Az, TA,) in the Kur [lxvi. 3], (O,) عَرَفَ
بَعْضَهُ, meaning He requited her, namely, Hafsah,
for part [thereof, i. e.] of what she had done:
(Fr, O, K:) and he did so indeed by divorcing
her: (Fr, TA:) or it means he acknowledged
part thereof: (K:) but others read بَعْضَهُ ↓ عَرَّفَ,
which, likewise, has the former of the two meanings expl. above: (Bd:) or this means he told
Hafsah part thereof. (Fr, O, Bd, * TA. [See
also 2.]) As first expl. above, this phrase is like
the saying to him who does good or who does
evil, أَنَا أَعْرِفُ لأَهْلِ الإِحْسَانِ وَأَعْرِفُ لِأَهْلِ الإِسَآءَةِ,
(O,) or لِلْمُحْسِنِ وَالمُسِىْءِ, (K,) [I know how to
requite the doer of good and the doer of evil,] i. e.
the case of the doer of good and that of the doer
of evil are not hidden from me nor is the suitable
requital of him. (O, K.) لَأَعْرِفَنَّكَهَا عَنْدَ رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ
occurs in a trad., meaning I will assuredly requite
thee for it in the presence of the Apostle of God so
that he shall know thy evil-doing: and is used in
threatening. (TA.)
-A2-  عَرَفَ الفَرَسَ, (S, O, K,)
aor.
عَرِفَ, (O,) inf. n. عَرْفٌ, (O, K,) He clipped the

عَرُفَ, inf. n. عِرَافَةٌ, I was, or
became, عَرِيف over the people, or party; i. e.,
manager, or orderer, of their affairs; as also
عَرُفْتُ عَلَيْهِمْ: (Msb:) or عَرُفَ, inf. n. عَرَاعَةٌ, signifies he was, or became, an عَرِيف; (S, O, K;)
as also عَرَفَ, aor.
عَرِفَ; (K;) i. e., a نَقِيب: (S, O:)
and when you mean that he acted as an عَرِيف,
you say, عَرَفَ عَلَيْنَا سِنِينَ, aor.
عَرُفَ, inf. n. عِرَافَةٌ,
[he acted over us as an عريف during some years,]
like كَتَبَ, aor. يَكْتُبُ, inf. n. كِتَابَةٌ. (S, O, K. *)
-A4-  عَرَفَ لِلْأَمْرِ, aor.
عَرِفَ, He was patient in relation
to the affair, or event; (K;) as also ↓ اعترف,
(O, K,) as some say. (O.) And عُرِفَ عِنْدَ المُصِيبَةِ
He was patient on the occasion of the affliction,
or misfortune. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And عَرَفَ He was, or
became, submissive, or tractable; (Ibn-'Abbád,
O, TA;) and so ↓ اعترف, (IAar, O, K,) said of
a man, (IAar, O,) and of a beast that one rides.
(O.)
-A5-  عَرُفَ, inf. n. عَرَافَةٌ, He (a man) was, or

And ↓ اعرف, said of food, It was sweet in its

TA) made much use of perfume. (IAar, O, K.)

-A6-  عُرِفَ, (S, O, K,) inf. n.
عَرْفٌ, (K, TA,) accord. to one or more of the
copies of the K عِرْفَانٌ, (TA,) He (a man, S, O)
had a purulent pustule, termed عَرْفَة, come forth
in the whiteness [or palm] of his hand. (S, O, K.)
2
تَعْرِيفٌ signifies The making to know; syn.
إِعْلَامٌ: (S, O, K, TA:) [or rather it has a more
restricted signification than the latter word, as is
indicated in the preceding paragraph:] and in
this sense its verb may have two objective complements: one says, عرّفهُ الأَمْرَ He made him to
know the affair, or case; syn. أَعْلَمَهُ إِيَّاهُ: [or he
acquainted him with it; or told him of it:] and
عرّفهُ بَيْتَهُ He made him to know, or acquainted
him with, the place of his house, or tent; syn.
أَعْلَمَهُ بِمَكَانِهِ: (TA:) [and] one says عَرَّفْتُهُ بِهِ,
meaning I made him to know it by means of any
of the five senses [or by mental perception; as also
عَرَّفْتُهُ إِيَّاهُ]. (Msb.) See also 1, former half.
And see 4. ―
-b2-  Also The making known; contr.
of تَنْكِيرٌ. (O, K.) عَرَّفَ بَعْضَهُ, in the Kur [lxvi. 3],
has been expl. as meaning He made known part
thereof. (TA. [For other explanations, see 1.])
And عَرَّفْتُهُ بِزَيْدٍ means I made him known by
the name of Zeyd; like the phrase سَمَّيْتُهُ بِزَيْدٍ.
(Sb, TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence, The explaining a term:
and an explanation thereof: thus used, its pl. is
تَعْرِيفَاتٌ: it has a less restricted meaning than
حَدٌّ, which signifies the “ defining,” and “ a
definition. ” ―
-b4-  And The making a noun, or a
nominal proposition, determinate. ―
-b5-  Hence also,]
The crying a stray-beast, or a beast or some other
thing that has been lost; (S, TA;) the mentioning
it [and describing it] and seeking to find him who
had knowledge of it. (TA.) ―
-b6-  And [hence likewise,] عرّفهُ بِذَنْبِهِ He branded him, or stigmatized
him, with his misdeed. (TA.)
-A2-  Also The rendering [a thing] fragrant; (S, O, * K, * TA;)
from العَرْفُ: (S:) and the adorning [it], decorating [it], or embellishing [it]. (TA.) عَرَّفَهَا لَهُمْ,
in the Kur [xlvii. 7], is said to mean He hath
rendered it fragrant [i. e. Paradise (الجَنَّة)] for
them: (S, O:) or it means He hath described it
to them so that, when they enter it, they shall
know it by that description, or so that they shall
know their places of abode therein: (O:) or He
hath described it to them, and made them desirous
of it: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [and the like is said by
Bd:] or He hath defined it for them so that there
shall be for every one a distinct paradise. (Bd.)
―
-b2-  One says also, عرّف رَأْسَهُ بِالدُّهْنِ He moistened the hair of his head abundantly with oil, or
with the oil; syn. رَوَّاهُ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And عرّف طَعَامَهُ
He made his food to have much seasoning, or
condiment. (TA.)
-A3-  Also The halting [of the
pilgrims] at 'Arafát. (S, O, K.) You say, عرّفوا,
(S, Mgh, O, Msb,) inf. n. as above, They halted
at 'Arafát; (Mgh, Msb;) or they were present
at 'Arafát; (S, O.) And [hence], in a postclassical sense, They imitated the people of 'Arafát, in some other place, by going forth to the
desert and there praying, and humbling themselves,
or offering earnest supplication; (Mgh;) or by
assembling in their mosques to pray and to beg
forgiveness: (Har p. 672:) the first who did
this was Ibn-'Abbás, at El-Basrah. (Mgh, and
Har ubi suprá.) And عرّف بِالهَدْىِ He brought
the animal for sacrifice to 'Arafát. (Mgh.)
-A4-
عرّف الشَّرَّ بَيْنَهُمْ He excited evil, or mischief, between them, or among them: the verb in this
phrase being formed by permutation from أَ َّ ثَ.
(Yaakoob, TA.)
4
اعرف فُلَانًا He told such a one of his misdeed,
then forgave him; and so ↓ عرّفهُ. (TA.)
-A2-  اعرف

mane]. (S, O, K.)
-A3-  See also 1, near the end.
5
تعرّف It was, or became, known. (Har p. 6.)
―
-b2-  And تعرّف إِلَيْهِ He made himself known to
him; (TA;) [and so ↓ استعرف; for] you say,
أَتَيْتُ مُتَنَكِّرًا ثُمَّ اسْتَعْرَفْتُ i. e. [I came disguising
myself, or assuming an unknown appearance, then]
I made known who I was: (L:) and اِئْتِ فُلَانًا
فَاسْتَعْرِفْ إِلَيْهِ حَتَّى يَعْرِفَكَ [Come thou to such a
one and make thyself known to him, that he may
know thee]. (S, O, K. *) [See also 8.] ―
-b3-  [Hence,]
one says, تعرّف إِلَى اللّٰهِ بِالعِبَادَاتِ وَالأَدْعِيَةِ [He
made himself known to God by religious services
and prayers]. (Er-Rághib, TA.) And تَعَرَّفْ إِلَى
اللّٰهِ فِى الرَّخَآءِ يَعْرِفْكَ فِى الشِّدَّةَ, occurring in a saying of the Prophet to Ibn-'Abbás, [may be rendered Make thyself known to God by obedience
in ampleness of circumstances, then He will
acknowledge thee in straitness: or] means render
thou obedience to God [&c., then] He will requite
thee [&c.]. (O.)
-A2-  تعرّفهُ [He acquainted himself, or made himself acquainted, with it, or him;
informed himself of it; learned it; and discovered
it: often used in these senses: for an instance of
the last, see تَفَرَّسَ: it is similar to تَعَلَّمَهُ, but
more restricted in meaning. ―
-b2-  And] He sought
the knowledge of it: (Har p. 6:) [or he did so
leisurely, or repeatedly, and effectually:] you say,
تَعَرَّفْتُ مَا عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ I sought leisurely, or repeatedly,
after the knowledge of what such a one possessed
until I knew it. (S, O, K. *) ―
-b3-  And تعرّفهُ المَكَانَ,
and فِى المَكَانِ, He looked at it, endeavouring to
obtain a clear knowledge thereof, in the place;
syn. تَأَمَّلَهُ بِهِ. (TA.)
-A3-  [تَعَرُّفٌ is also expl. in
the KL by the Pers. words بعرف كارى كردن,
app. meaning The acting with عُرْف i. e. goodness,
&c.: but Golius has hence rendered the verb
“ convenienter opus fecit. ”]

-b2-  And i. q. تَفَاخَرُوا
[i. e. They vied, competed, or contended for superiority, in glorying, or boasting, or in glory, &c.;

are expl. as having this meaning. (TA.)
8
اعترف بِهِ He acknowledged it, or confessed
it, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) namely, a misdeed, (S,
O,) or a thing; (Mgh, Msb;) and so به ↓ عَرَفَ
and لَهُ, namely, his misdeed [&c.]; (K;) [for]
sometimes they put عَرَفَ in the place of اعترف;
(O;) and so ↓ عَرَفَهُ: (Ksh and Bd and Jel in
xvi. 85:) [الإِحْسَانِ ↓ عِرْفَانُ (occurring in the K
voce شُكْرٌ &c.) means The acknowledgment, or
confession, of beneficence; thankfulness, or gratitude:] and one says, لأَِحَدٍ يَصْرَعُنِى ↓ مَا أَعْرِفُ
(S, O, TA) i. e. ما أَعْتَرِفُ, (S, O,) meaning I do
not acknowledge [any one that will throw me down]:

and condition. (K.) And اعترف لَهُ He described
himself to him in such a manner as that he would
certify himself of him thereby. (TA.) [See also 5.]
―
-b3-  اعترف also signifies He described a thing
that had been picked up, and a stray-beast, in
such a manner as that he would be known to be
its owner. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And you say, اِعْتَرَفْتُ القَوْمَ,
(S, O,) or فُلَانًا, (K,) I asked the people, or
party, (S, O,) or such a one, (K,) respecting a
subject of information, in order that I might know

thing: a meaning clearly shown in the M by an

(عُرْف). (S, O, TA.) ―

man, O) mounted upon the mane (عُرْف) of the
horse. (O, K. [In the CK, والفَرَسُ عَلا عُرْفُهُ is
erroneously put for وَالفَرَسَ عَلَا عَلَى عُرْفِهِ.]) ―
-b3-
And اعرورف (said of a man, K) (assumed tropical:)  He rose upon
the أَعْرَاف [pl. of عُرْفٌ, and app. here meaning the
wall between Paradise and Hell: (see the Kur
vii. 44:) probably used in this sense in a trad.].
(Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.) ―
-b4-  Said of the sea, (tropical:)  Its
waves became high, (S, O, K, TA,) like the عُرْف
[or mane]: and in like manner said of the torrent,
(tropical:)  It became heapy and high. (TA.) ―

blood, (assumed tropical:)  It had froth (O, K) like the عُرْف [or
mane]. (O.) ―
-b6-  Said of palm-trees (نَخْل), (tropical:)  They

(tropical:)  He prepared himself for evil, or mischief, (S, O,
K, TA,) and raised his head, or stretched forth
his neck, for that purpose. (TA.) [See also 12

عَرْفٌ An odour, whether fragrant or fetid, (S,
O, K, TA,) in most instances the former, (K,
TA,) as when it is used in relation to Paradise:
(TA:) and ↓ عَرْفَةٌ signifies [the same, i. e.] رِيحٌ
(K, TK) and رَائِحَةٌ. (TK.) One says, ما أَطْيَبَ
عَرْفَهُ [How fragrant is its odour!]. (S, O.) And
لَا يَعْجِزُ مَسْكُ السَّوْءِ عَنْ عَرْفِ السَّوْءِ [The bad hide
will not lack the fetid odour]; (S, O, K;) a prov.;
(S, O;) applied to the low, ignoble, mean, or
sordid, who will not cease from his evil doing;
he being likened to the hide that is not fit for
being tanned; (O, K;) wherefore it is cast aside,
and becomes fetid. (O.) And some read, in the
Kur [lxxvii. 1], وَالْمُرْسَلَاتِ عَرْفًا, [as meaning By
the winds that are sent forth with fragrance,]
instead of عُرْفًا. (TA.)
-A2-  Also A certain plant:
or the ثُمَام [or panic grass]: (K:) or a certain
plant, not of the [kind called] حَمْض, nor of the
[kind called] عِضَاه; (Ibn-'Abbád, O, L, K;) of
the [kind called] ثُمَام. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, L.)
عُرْفٌ [Acknowledgment, or confession;] a subst.
from الاِعْتِرَافُ, (S, O, K, TA,) as meaning الإِقْرَارُ.
(TA.) Hence, (S, O,) you say, (K,) لَهُ عَلَىَّ أَلْفٌ
عُرْفًا, meaning اِعْتِرَافًا [i. e. A thousand is due to
him on my part by acknowlegment, or confession];
(S, O, * K;) the last word being a corroborative.
(S, O.) ―
-b2-  Also i. q. ↓ مَعْرُوفٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;)
as also ↓ عَارِفَةٌ, (S, O, K,) of which the pl. is
عَوَارِفُ; (O, K;) عُرْفٌ being contr. of نُكْرٌ, (S, O,
K,) and ↓ مَعْرُوفٌ being contr. of مُنْكَرٌ [as syn.
with نُكْرٌ]; (S, Mgh, O, K;) i. e. Goodness, or a
good quality or action; and gentleness, or lenity;
and beneficence, [favour, kindness, or bounty,] or
a benefit, a benefaction, or an act of beneficence
[or favour or kindness]: (Msb:) عُرْفٌ is also
expl. as signifying liberality, or bounty; (K,
TA;) and so ↓ عُرُفٌ, which is a dial. var. thereof:
(TA:) and a thing liberally, or freely, bestowed;
or given: (K:) and ↓ مَعْرُوفٌ is expl. as signifying liberality, or bounty, when it is with moderation, or with a right and just aim: [and sometimes it means simply moderation:] and sincere,
or honest, advice or counsel or action: and good
fellowship with one's family and with others of
mankind: it is an epithet in which the quality of
a subst. predominates: (TA:) and signifies any
action, or deed, of which the goodness is known by
reason and by the law; and مُنْكَرٌ signifies the
contr. thereof. (Er-Rághib, TA.) It is said in
the Kur [vii. 198], وَأْمُرْ بِالْعُرْفِ, (O,) meaning
[And enjoin thou goodness, &c., or] what is deemed
good, or approved, of actions. (Bd.) And you
say, أَوْلَاهُ عُرْفًا, (S, O,) or ↓ عَارِفَةً, (TA,) meaning
↓ مَعْرُوفًا [i. e. He did to him, or conferred upon
him, a benefit, &c.]. (S, O, TA.) وَلِلْمُطَلَّقَاتِ
↓ مَتَاعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ [in the Kur ii. 242] means [And
for the divorced women there shall be a provision
of necessaries] with moderation, or right and just
aim, and beneficence. (TA.) And ↓ قَوْلٌ مَعْرُوفٌ
وَمَغْفِرَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ صَدَقَةٍ يَتْبَعُهَا أَذًى [in the same,
ii. 265,] means Refusal with pleasing [or gracious] speech, (Bd, Jel, TA,) and prayer [expressed to the beggar, that God may sustain him,]
(TA,) and forgiveness granted to the beggar for
his importunity (Bd, Jel) or obtained by such
refusal from God or from the beggar, (Bd,) are
better than an alms which annoyance follows
(TA) by reproach for a benefit conferred and for
begging. (Jel.) And مَنْ كَانَ فَقِيرًا فَلْيَأْكُلْ
↓ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ [in the same, iv. 6,] means [And such
as is poor, let him take for himself (lit. eat)] according to what is approved by reason and by the
law, (TA,) or according to his need (Bd) and the
recompense of his labour. (Bd, Jel.) ―
-b3-  [العُرْفُ,
in lexicology, signifies The commonly-known, commonly-received, or common conventional, language;
common parlance, or common usage: mostly
meaning that of a whole people; in which case,
the epithet العَامُّ is sometimes added: but often
meaning that of a particular class; as, for instance, of the lawyers. Hence the terms حَقِيقَةٌ
عُرْفًا and مَجَازٌ عُرْفًا, expl. in arts. حق and جوز.
See also مُتَعَارَفٌ: and see عَادَةٌ.]

beast; (Msb;) as also ↓ عُرُفٌ: (K:) [see also
مَعْرَفَةٌ:] or the part, of the neck, which is the place
of growth of the hair: [see again مَعْرَفَةٌ:] and
the part, of the neck [of a bird], which is the place
of growth of the feathers: (TA:) [or the feathers
themselves of the neck; used in this sense in the
K and TA in art. برل, as is shown by the context therein:] and the [comb or] elongated piece
of flesh on the upper part of the head of a cock;
to which the بَظْر of a girl is likened: (Msb:) pl.
أَعْرَافٌ [properly a pl. of pauc.] (O, TA) and
عُرُوفٌ. (TA.) As used it in relation to a man,
explaining the phrase جَآءَ فُلَانٌ مُبْرَثِلًّا لِلشَّرِّ as
meaning نَافِشًا عُرْفَهُ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Such a one came as
though ruffling the feathers of his neck to do evil,
or mischief]. (TA.) And [hence] it is said in a
trad., جَاؤُوا كَأَنَّهُمْ عُرُفٌ (assumed tropical:)  [They came as though
they were a mane], meaning, following one another.
(TA.) And one says, جَآء القَوْمُ عُرْفًا عُرْفًا (assumed tropical:)  [The
people, or party, came] one after another: like the
saying, طَارَ القَطَا عُرْفًا (assumed tropical:)  [The sand-grouse flew] one

(S, O, K,) in the Kur [lxxvii. 1], a metaphorical
phrase, from the عُرْف of the horse, meaning (tropical:)  [By
the angels, or the winds, that are sent forth] consecutively, like [the several portions of] the عُرْف
[or mane] of the horse: (S, O:) or the meaning
is, sent forth بِالْمَعْرُوفِ, (S, O, K, TA,) i. e. with
beneficence, or benefit: (TA:) [for further explanations, see the expositions of Z and Bd or
others: and see also art. رسل:] some read عَرْفًا
[expl. in the next preceding paragraph]. (TA.)
―
-b2-  [Hence also,] (tropical:)  The waves of the sea. (K,
TA.) ―
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  Elevated sand; as also ↓ عُرُفٌ
and ↓ عُرْفَةٌ: pl. (of the last, TA) عُرَفٌ and (of

likewise (assumed tropical:)  an elevated place: (K:) and the first,
(assumed tropical:)  the elevated, or overtopping, back of a portion

-b4-  [The pl.] الأَعْرَافُ, (S, O, K,)
mentioned in the Kur [vii. 44 and 46], (S, O,) is
applied to (assumed tropical:)  A wall between Paradise and Hell:
(S, O, K:) so it is said: (S, O:) or the upper
parts of the wall: or by عَلَى الأَعْرَافِ may be
there meant عَلَى مَعْرِفَةِ أَهْلِ الجَنَّةِ وَأَهْلِ النَّارِ [i. e.,
app., and possessing knowledge of the people of
Paradise and of the people of Hell: for it seems
that مُحْتَوُونَ, or the like, is to be understood before على]. (Zj, TA.) [And hence it is the name
of The Seventh Chapter of the Kur-án.] By
أَصْحَابُ الأَعْرَافِ [The occupants of the اعراف],
there mentioned, are said to be meant persons
whose good and evil works have been equal, so
that they shall not have merited Paradise by the
former nor Hell by the latter: or prophets: or
angels. (Zj, TA.) ―
-b5-  See also عُرْفَةٌ. ―

أَعْرَافٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The higher, or highest, (K,
TA,) and first, or foremost, (TA,) of winds; (K,
TA;) and likewise of clouds, and of mists.
(TA.) ―

the speech of the people of El-Bahreyn, (As, O,)
A species [or variety] of palm-trees; (As, O, K;)
and so [the pl.] أَعْرَافٌ (O, K) is expl. by IDrd:
(O:) or when they first yield fruit, or edible
fruit, or ripe fruit; (K, TA;) or when they
attain to doing so: (TA:) or a [sort of] palmtree in El-Bahreyn, also called بُرْشُوم; (K, TA;)
but this is what is meant by As and IDrd. (TA.)

or citron]. (K.)
-A3-  Also pl. of عَرُوفٌ: ―
-b2-  and of
أَعْرَفُ and عَرْفَآءُ. (K.)
عِرْفٌ, with kesr, is from the saying, مَا عَرَفَ
عِرْفِى إِلَّا بِأَخَرَةٍ, (S, O,) which means He did not
know me save at the last, or lastly, or latterly.
(S, O, K.)
-A2-  And it signifies Patience. (IAar,
O, K.) A poet says, (namely Aboo-Dahbal ElJumahee, TA,)
قُلْ لِابْنِ قَيْسٍ أَخِى الرُّقَيَّاتِ
مَا أَحْسَنَ العِرْفَ فِى المُصِيبَاتِ
[Say thou to the son of Keys, the brother of Er-Rukeiyat, How good is patience in afflictions!].

elongated, tract of land, producing plants, or
herbage. (O, K.) ―
-b3-  Also, (O, K,) and ↓ عُرْفٌ,

(K:) [like أُرْفَةٌ:] pl. of the former عُرَفٌ. (O,
K, TA.)
عِرْفَةٌ [an inf. n.] I. q. مَعْرِفَةٌ. (O, K. [See 1,
first sentence. In the O, it seems to be regarded
as a simple subst.]) ―
-b2-  See also عَرْفَةٌ.
يَوْمُ عَرَفَهَ The ninth day of [the month] ذُو الحِجَّة
[when the pilgrims halt at عَرَفَات]: (S, Mgh, O,
Msb, K:) the latter word being without tenween,
(S, O,) imperfectly decl., because it is of the fem.
gender and a proper name, (Msb,) and not admitting the art. ال. (S, O, Msb.) ―
-b2-  See also
the next paragraph.
عَرَفَاتٌ The place [or mountain] where the pilgrims halt (Mgh, O, Msb, K) on the day of عَرَفَة
[above mentioned], (O, K,) [described by Burckhardt as a granite hill, about a mile, or a mile
and a half, in circuit, with sloping sides, rising
nearly two hundred feet above the level of the
adjacent plain,] said to be nine miles, (Msb,) or
twelve miles, (K,) from Mekkeh; (Msb, K;) said
by J to be a place in, or at, Minè, but incorrectly, (K, TA,) unless thereby be meant near
Minè; (TA;) also called by some ↓ عَرَفَةُ;
(Mgh, Msb;) but the saying نَزَلْنَا عَرَفَةَ, (S, O,
K,) or نَزَلْتُ بِعَرَفَةَ, (Msb,) [We, or I, alighted
at عَرَفَة,] is like a post-classical phrase, (S, O, K,)
and (S, O) it is said to be (Msb) not genuine
Arabic: (S, O, Msb:) عَرَفَاتٌ is a [proper] name
in the pl. form, and therefore is not itself pluralized: (S, O, K:) it is as though the term عَرَفَةٌ
applied to every distinct portion thereof: (TA:)
as Fr says, it has, correctly, no sing.; (S, O;)
and it is determinate as denoting a particular
place; (Sb, S, O, K, TA;) and therefore not admitting the article ال; (Sb, TA;) differing from
الزَّيْدُونَ [because this is a proper name common
to a number of persons]: you say, هٰؤُلَآءِ عَرَفَاتٌ
حَسَنَةً [lit. These are 'Arafát, in a good state],
putting the epithet in the accus. case because it is
indeterminate [as a denotative of state, like مُصَدِّقًا
in the saying وَهُوَ الحَقُّ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا مَعَهُمْ, in the
Kur ii. 85]: (S, O:) it is decl. (مَصْرُوفَةٌ [more
properly مُعْرَبَةٌ]) because the ت is equivalent to
the ى and و in مُسْلِمِينَ and مُسْلِمُونَ, (S, O,
K,) the tenween becoming equivalent to the ن,
therefore, being used as a proper name, it is left
in its original state, like as is مُسْلِمُونَ when
used as a proper name: (Akh, S, O, K:) [i. e.,]
it is decl. in the manner of مُسْلِمَاتٌ and مُؤْمِنَاتٌ,
the tenween being like that which corresponds to
the masc. pl. termination ن, not the tenween of
perfect declinability, because it is a proper name
and of the fem. gender, wherefore it does not
admit the article ال. (Msb.) عَرَفَاتٌ was thus
named because Adam and Eve knew each other
(تَعَارَفَا) there (IF, O, K, TA) after their descent
from Paradise: (TA:) or because Gabriel, when
he taught Abraham the rites and ceremonies of
the pilgrimage, said to him “ Hast thou known? ”
(أَعَرَفْتَ), (O, K,) and he replied “ I have known ”
(عَرَفْتُ): (K:) or because it is a place sanctified
and magnified, as though it were rendered
fragrant (عُرِّفَ i. e. طُيِّبَ): (O, K:) or because
the people know one another (يَتَعَارَفُونَ) there:
or, accord. to Er-Rághib, because of men's
making themselves known (نِتَعَرُّفِ العِبَادِ) there
by religious services and prayers. (TA.)

an epithet; (O;) occurring in a poem of Er-Rá'ee, and expl. by some as the name of a companion of his: (O, K: *) and عُرُفَّانٌ signifies the
same; (K;) but this is said by Sb to be a word
transferred from the category of proper names.

upon [one or the other of two species of plants,
i. e.] a رِمْثَة or an عُنْظُوَانَة: (AHn, K, TA:) but
AHn mentions only the latter form of the word,
عُرُفَّانٌ. (TA.)

also ↓ عَارِفٌ: (Msb:) pl. as above: (S, IAth,
Msb:) it is said that he is over a few persons, and
the مَنْكِب is over five عُرَقَآء, then the أَمِير is over
these. (Msb.) It is said in a trad. that the عُرَفَآء
are in Hell, as a caution against undertaking the
office of chief, or head, on account of the trial
that is therein; for when one does not perform
the duty thereof, he sins, and deserves punishment. (TA.) ―

عَرَّافٌ A كَاهِن [or diviner]: (S, O, Msb, K:)
or the former is one who informs of the past, and
the latter is one who informs of the past and of
the future: (Msb:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib,
[but the converse of his explanation seems to be
that which is correct,] the former is one who informs of future events, and the latter is one who
informs of past events. (TA.) Hence the saying
of the Prophet, that whoso comes to an عرّاف and
asks him respecting a thing, prayer of forty nights
will not be accepted from him. (O.) ―
