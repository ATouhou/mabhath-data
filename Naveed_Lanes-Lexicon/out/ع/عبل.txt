اعبل He, or it, was, or became, thick and
white: (K:) originally used in relation to the fore
arms. (TA.)
-A2-  اعبل الشَّجَرُ The trees put forth
their [leaves termed] عَبَل: and the trees dropped
their leaves: thus having two contr. significations: (O, K: *) or اعبل الأَرْطَى the [trees called]
ارطى became in the state in which their هَدَب [or
عَبَل (q. v.)] were thick, in the hot season, and
red, and fit to be used for tanning therewith:
and, accord. to As, اعبلت الشَّجَرَةُ signifies the
tree dropped its leaves: (S:) accord. to En-Nadr,
اعبلت الأَرْطَاةُ signifies the ارطاة put forth its leaves:
and also, dropped its leaves: (Az, TA:) and ISd
mentions, on the authority of AHn, اعبل الشَّجَرُ
as meaning the trees put forth their fruit; but he
says, “I have not found this to be known. ”
(TA.) [See also 1, last sentence.]
عَبْلٌ Large, big, bulky, or thick; (S, O, Msb,
K;) as also ↓ عَبِلٌ: (K:) fem. of the former with ة:
and pl. [masc.] عِبَالٌ, (S, O, K, TA,) like ضِخَامٌ
[pl. of the syn. ضَخْمٌ]: and the pl. of عَبْلَةٌ is
عَبْلَاتٌ, (S, O, TA,) [with the ب quiescent,] because it is an epithet. (TA.) It is applied in
this sense to anything. (K.) Thus, in a trad.,
it is applied to a man. (TA.) And one says
رَجُلٌ عَبْلُ الذِّرَاعَيْنِ A man large, &c., in the fore
arms. (S, O, Msb. *) And فَرَسٌ عَبْلٌ الشَّوَى A

woman. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K. *) And ↓ عَابِلٌ applied to a boy, or young man, signifies Fat: and

عُبُلٌ. (TA.)
عَبَلٌ i. q. هَدَبٌ i. e. (S, O) Any leaves that are
[as though they were] twisted, (S, O, K,) not expanded, (K,) [generally meaning slender sprigs,
like strings, garnished with minute, amplexicaul,
appressed, acute leaves, overlying one another like
the scales of a fish,] such as those of the طَرْفَآء (S,
O, K) and of the أَرْطَى and of the أَثْل and the
like of these: (S, O:) and, (K,) as some say,
(TA,) the fruit of the ارطى: (K, TA:) and,
(K,) as some say, (TA,) the هَدَب thereof, when
they have become thick, (K, TA,) in the hot season, and red, (TA,) and fit to be used for tanning therewith: or slender leaves: (K, TA:) or
the like of leaves, but not [what are commonly
called] leaves: (TA:) or such as are falling
thereof; (K, TA;) i. e., of leaves: (TA:) and
[in the CK “ or ”] such as are coming forth (K,
TA) thereof: (TA:) thus having two contr.
significations. (K, TA.)
عَبِلٌ: see عَبْلٌ, first sentence.
عَبَالٌ The mountain-rose (وَرْد جَبَلِىّ [one of the
appellations now applied to the eglantine, or sweet
brier, more commonly called the نِسْرِين]): (S,
Msb, K:) AHn says, and Arab of the desert informed me that the عَبَال is the rose of the mountain (وَرْدُ الجَبَلِ), of which is the white, and the
red, and the yellow; (O, TA;) having a goodly
hip (دَلِيك [thus correctly written in the O, but
afterwards altered to دِلِّيك,]) in size and redness
like the full-grown, unripe date, which, when it
becomes ripe, is sweet, and delicious, like the fresh
ripe date, and is sent from one to another as a
present: (O:) [n. un. with ة:] the عَبَالَة, he says,
has short, curved thorns, its rose is sweet-scented,
and it grows so as to compose thickets, (O, TA,)
and is depastured, (O,) and it becomes thick,
(K,) and staves (O, K) thick and good, (O,) or
thick and strong, (TA,) are cut from it: (O, K,
TA:) the staff of Moses is said to have been
from it: (K, TA:) or, as AHn says, the people
assert that the staff of Moses was an عَبَالَة. (O.)
عَبُولٌ: see عَبْلٌ, last sentence.
-A2-  عَبُولُ [said in
the K to be like صَبُور, but it is imperfectly decl.,
as a fem. proper name,] Death; or the decree of

and see also عَابِلٌ.

أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ عَبَالَّتَهُ, with teshdeed to the ل, (S,

upon him his weight. (S, O, K.)
عَابِلٌ: see عَبْلٌ, last sentence.
-A2-  ↓ عَابِلَتِى عَبُولُ

my companions is death, or shall be death alone].

عَبَنْبَلٌ Great, (AA, O, K, TA,) big, or bulky,
(TA,) and strong. (K, TA.)
أَعْبَلُ A mountain of which the stones are white:
(K:) or rough, rugged, or thick, stone, which
may be red, and may be white, and may be black,
(ISh, O, K, *) and may be a rugged, high mountain: (ISh, O:) expl. in the S as meaning
white stones; but correctly, as IB says, white
stone: and أَعْبِلَةٌ is an irreg. pl. thereof. (TA.)
―
-b2-  And [the fem.] عَبْلَآءُ signifies A rock: (K,
TA: [in the CK, أَو should be inserted after
الصَّخْرَةُ:]) or a white rock: (Th, S, K, TA:) or
a white, hard rock: (TA:) pl. عِبَالٌ, like بِطَاحٌ
pl. of بَطْحَآءُ. (S, TA.) And A white [hill, or
eminence such as is termed] أَكَمَة. (TA.) And
A narrow strip (طَرِيدَةٌ) in the midst of a land,
the stones of which are white, resembling the stones
from which fire is struck, and sometimes people
do strike fire with some of them: they are not
what are called مَرْو; [but] resembling بِلَّوْر [i. e.
crystal]. (TA.)
مِعْبَلٌ An implement with which trees are cut
[down]. (TA.)
مِعْبَلَةٌ A broad and long arrow-head: (As, S,
O, K:) or an iron [arrow-head] made broad,

مَعْبُولٌ [pass. part. n. of عَبَلَهُ; as such, Cut,
&c.: ―
-b2-  and] Repelled: thus in the following
verse, cited by IAar:
هَا إِنَّ رَمْيِى عَنْهُمُ لَمَعْبُولْ
فَلَا صَرِيخَ الْيَوْمَ إِلَّا الْمَصْقُولْ
[Now verily my shooting in defence of them is
repelled; so there is no aider to-day but the
polished sword]: the speaker was shooting at his
enemy, and the shooting availed not at all; so he
fought with the sword. (O.)
