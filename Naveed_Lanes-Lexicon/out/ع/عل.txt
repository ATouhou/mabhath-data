-b2-  [Hence, (assumed tropical:)  He dyed it a second
time; namely, a hide: see a verse cited voce
مُحْلِفٌ.] ―
-b3-  Hence [also], (TA,) عَلَّ الضَّارِبُ
المَضْرُوبَ (tropical:)  The beater plied the beaten with a
continued beating; (S, O, K, TA;) and so عَلَّهُ
ضَرْبًا. (TA.) ―

-A5-  and the
trans. verb is عَلَّهُ, [syn. with اعلّهُ,] aor. in this
case
عَلُ3َ. (Msb. See 4.)
-A6-  [عُلَّ الشَّىْءُ is mentioned in the S, with the addition ↓ فَهُوَ مَعْلُولٌ,
but without any explanation; perhaps as meaning The thing was caused; from عِلَّةٌ “ a cause,”
of which مَعْلُولٌ (q. v.) is the correlative: but the
context seems to indicate that it means the thing
was used for the purpose of diverting from some
want: Golius appears to have read عَلَّ, and to
have been led by what next precedes it in the S
to render it loco alterius rei fuit lactavitve res.]

عَالَلْتُ النَّاقَةَ I milked the she-camel in the
morning and the evening and the middle of the
day: (Lh, O, TA:) in the K, erroneously, عَالَّتِ
النَّاقَةُ [as meaning the she-camel was milked at
those times]: (TA:) and the subst. is ↓ عِلَالٌ:
(K: [but there is no reason why this should not
be regarded as a reg. inf. n.:]) Lh cites this
verse, (O,) of an Arab of the desert, (TA,)

عَنِ العِلَالِ وَلَا عَنْ قِدْرِ أَضْيَافِى

4
أَعْلَلْتُ الإِبِلَ I brought, or sent, back the
camels from the water (S, O, K) after they had
satisfied their thirst, (O,) or before they had satisfied their thirst: (S, K:) or, (S, O, K,) [if the
latter is meant,] accord. to some of the etymologists, (S, O,) it is with غ; (S, O, K; [see 4 in
art. غل;]) as though it were from the meaning
of “ thirsting; ” but the former is what has been
heard; (S, O;) and it means I gave the camels to
drink the second draught, or watered them the
second time, and then brought them, or sent them,
back from the water, having their thirst satisfied;
and thus, too, means الإِبِلَ ↓ عَلَّلَتُ; the contr. of
أَغْلَلْنُهَا. (TA.) See also 1, first sentence. ―

غَدَآء; (M voce سُلْفَةٌ, and K voce لُمْجَةٌ, &c.;)
and as a beast does with the cud: (TA:) he
occupied himself so as to divert himself, and fed
[or sustained] himself, with it: (Har p. 23:) and
he whiled away his time with it. (W p. 55.) And
تعلّل بالْمَرْأَةِ He diverted himself with the woman.
(K.) ―

himself vainly. (S and TA in art. جدب: see a

ثَدْىَ أُمِّهِ, and app. meaning The child exhausts
the عُلَالَة, or remains of milk, in the breast of his
mother]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And تَعَالَلْتُ النَّاقَةَ (assumed tropical:)  I
elicited from the she-camel what power she had
[remaining] of going on. (S, O.) ―
-b3-  And تَعَالَلْتُ
نَفْسِى signifies the same as تَلَوَّمْتُهَا [app. meaning
I waited for myself to accomplish a want, or an
object of desire, so that I might avoid blame:
for تَلَوَّمَ as signifying اِنْتَظَرَ and تَنَظَّرَ is trans. as
well as intrans.; and seems to be originally similar to تَأَثَّمَ and تَحَنَّثَ &c.]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  See
also 5, last sentence.
8
اعتلّ: see 1, latter half. ―
-b2-  [Hence, اعتلّت
الرِّيحُ (assumed tropical:)  The wind became faint, or feeble.]
-A2-  See
also 5, first sentence. ―
-b2-  Also He excused himself; or adduced, or urged, an excuse, or a plea;

عَلَيْهِ بِعِلَّةٍ (S, MA, O) He adduced, or urged, an
excuse, or a plea, or pretext, for it. (MA.)
And hence, اِعْتِلَالَاتُ الفُقَهَآءِ [The pleas, or allegations, of the lawyers, which they adduce, or
upon which they lay hold]. (Msb.)
-A3-  اعتلّهُ He
hindered, prevented, impeded, or withheld, him;

عَلَّ and لَعَلَّ (S, O, Mughnee, K) are dial. vars.;
or the former is the original, the ل being augmentative, (S, O, Mughnee,) prefixed for the purpose
of corroboration: the meaning is expectation of
a thing hoped for or feared; (S, O;) importing
hope, or eager desire, and fear, or caution: (S,
O, K:) each is a particle, like إِنَّ and لَيْتَ and
كَأَنَّ and لٰكِنَّ: (S, O:) and like عَسَى [q. v.] in
meaning; but like إِنَّ in government; (Mughnee;)
governing the subject in the accus. case, and the
predicate in the nom.: one says, عَلَّكَ تَفْعَلُ [Maybe, or perhaps, thou wilt do such a thing], and
عَلِّى أَفْعَلُ [May-be I shall do], and لَعَلِّى أَفْعَلُ;
and sometimes they said, عَلَّنِى and لَعَلَّنِى; (S,
O;) and one says also ↓ عَلْ and ↓ لَعَلْ, with the
ل quiescent, and ↓ عَلْكَ and ↓ لَعَلْكَ: (O:) [and
accord. to general usage, one says, لَعَلَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ
May-be Zeyd is standing:] and the tribe of
'Okeyl made each to govern the subject in the
gen. case, (S, O, Mughnee,) saying, لَعَلَّ زَيْدٍ قَائِمٌ;
(S, O;) and allowed the pronouncing عَلِّ and
لَعَلِّ: (Mughnee:) sometimes its subject is suppressed, as in عَلَّ أَنْ أَتَقَدَّمَ, meaning لَعَلَّنِى أَنْ
أَتَقَدَّمَ [May-be I shall precede]: (Ham p. 517:)
the Koofees allow the mansoob aor. [immediately]
after, on the authority of the reading of Hafs, [in
the Kur xl. 38,] لَعَلِّى أَبْلُغَ الأَسْبَابَ [May-be I
may reach the places of ascent, or the regions, or
tracts, of the heavens]. (Mughnee.) Other dial.
vars. of عَلّ are mentioned in art. لعل [q. v.]. (K.)

(M, K, * TA.) And A man whose skin is contracted by disease. (IDrd, O, K.) ―
-b3-  Also One
in whom is no good: Esh-Shenfarà says, وَلَسْتُ

the context seems rather to require one of the
other meanings mentioned above: and another
reading (بِفِلٍّ) is mentioned by De Sacy, in his
Chrest. Ar., 2nd ed., ii. 359]. (O, TA.) ―
-b4-  Also

عَلَّةٌ A [single] second draught. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  And
hence, (Mgh,) A woman's fellow-wife; her husband's wife: (Mgh, Msb, * K:) or, as some say,
a step-mother: but the former is the more correct
meaning: (Mgh:) pl. عَلَّاتٌ. (Msb.) Whence,
بَنُو العَلَّاتِ The sons of one father by different
mothers: as though, when he added by marriage
a second wife to the first, he took a second
draught. (S, * Mgh, O, * Msb, * K. *) أَوْلَادُ الأَخْيَافِ
means the contr. of this: and أَوْلَادُ الأَعْيَانِ, the
sons of the same father and mother. (Msb.)
Accord. to IB, one says, هُمَا أَخَوَانِ مِنْ ضَرَّتَيْنِ
[They two are brothers from two fellow-wives];
but they did not say, مِنْ ضَرَّةٍ: and accord. to
ISh, one says, هُمْ بَنُو عَلَّةٍ and أَوْلَادُ عَلَّةٍ. (TA.)
And it is said in a trad., الأَنْبِيَآءُ بَنُو عَلَّاتِ, (Mgh,)
or أَوْلَادُ عَلَّاتٍ, (TA,) meaning The prophets are
of different mothers, but of one religion: (T, Mgh,
TA:) or of one faith, but of different religious
laws or ordinances. (Nh, TA.)
-A2-  See also عُلَالَةٌ.
عِلَّةٌ An accident that befalls an object and
causes its state, or condition, to become altered.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And hence, (TA,) A disease, sickness,
or malady; (S, O, K, TA;) because, by its befalling, the state becomes altered from strength
to weakness; so says El-Munáwee in the “ Tow-
keef: ” (TA:) or a disease that diverts [from the
ordinary occupations; app. regarded as being
from what next follows]: pl. عِلَلٌ (Msb) [and
عِلَّاتٌ]. ―
-b3-  Also An accident, or event, that diverts
the person to whom it occurs from his course, (S,
O, K,) or from the object of his want: (M:) as
though it became a second occupation hindering
him from his former occupation. (S, O.) ―
-b4-  And
[hence,] an excuse; an apology; a plea whereby
one excuses himself. (TA.) Hence, (K, * TA,)
لَاتَعْدَمُ خَرْقَآءُ عِلَّةً [expl. in art. خرق]. (K, TA.)
[See also another ex. in art. سأل, conj. 3.] ―
-b5-
And A cause: [and particularly an efficient
cause:] (M, K:) one says, هٰذَا عِلَّةٌ لِهٰذَا This
is a cause of this: (M:) and هٰذِهِ عِلَّتُهُ This is
its cause: (K:) [and ↓ عِلَّةٌ وَمَعْلُولٌ Cause and
effect; a phrase of frequent occurrence in theological and other works:] and [sometimes عِلَّةٌ
signifies a pretext, or pretence:] it is said in a
trad. of 'Áïsheh, فَكَانَ عَبْدُ الرَّحْمٰنِ يَضْرِبُ رِجْلِى
بِعِلَّةِ الرَّاحِلَةِ, meaning And 'Abd-Er-Rahmán
was beating my leg with the pretence, or pretext,
of his beating the side of the camel with his leg.
(TA.) ―
-b6-  The phrase عَلَى عِلَّاتِهِ means In every
case. (S, O, K.) Zubeyr says,
إِنَّ البَخِيلَ مَلُومٌ حَيْثُ كَانَ وَاٰ
كِنَّ الجَوَادَ عَلَى عِلَّاتِهِ هَرِمُ
[Verily the niggard is blamed wherever he be; but
the liberal in all his circumstances is Herim]: (S,
O:) meaning his companion Herim Ibn-Sinán
El-Murree. (S in art. هرم.)
عَلَلٌ and ↓ عَلٌّ [both mentioned in the first
paragraph as inf. ns.] The second draught: or a
drinking after drinking, uninterruptedly: (K:) or
the former signifies a second drinking; one says
عَلَلٌ بَعْدَ نَهَلٍ [a second drinking after a first
drinking]: (S, O:) or a drinking after drinking:
(Msb:) and the second watering of camels; the
first being termed the نَهَل: (As, TA:) these two
terms are also similarly used in relation to suckling: and one of the unknown poets says,
ثُمَّ انْثَنَى مِنْ بَعْدِ ذَا فَصَلَّى
↓ عَلَى النَّبِىِّ نَهَلًا وَعَلَّا
[Then he turned, or turned away or back, after
that, and blessed the Prophet a first time and a
second time]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, the former, Food
that has been eaten. (Kr, TA.) [See also نَهَلٌ.]
عُلُلٌ: see عُلْعُلٌ.
عِلَالٌ: see 3; of which it is said in the K to
be the subst., though app. the inf. n.
عَلُولٌ Some light food with which the sick person
is diverted or occupied [so as to be rendered contented]: pl. عُلُلٌ. (TA.)
عَلِيلٌ Diseased, sick, or ill; (S, Msb;) and so
with ة applied to a woman: (Mgh:) or, the
former, rendered diseased &c. by God; [being
used as the pass. part. n. of أَعَلَّهُ in the phrase
اعلّهُ اللّٰهُ;] (K;) as also ↓ مُعَلٌّ, (Msb, K,) agreeably with rule, but this is seldom used; (Msb;)
and ↓ مَعْلُولٌ, from عَلَّهُ اللّٰهُ; (Msb;) or this last
should not be said, for, though the theologians
say it, it is not of established authority. (K, *
TA.)
-A2-  عَلِيلَةٌ also signifies A woman perfumed
repeatedly: (AA, O, K, TA:) and accord. to AA,
↓ مُعَلَّلٌ, as used in a verse of Imra-el-Keys, signifies perfumed time after time. (O.) [See also
مُعَلِّلٌ.]
عُلَالَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ تَعِلَّةٌ (S, * K) and ↓ عَلَّةٌ,

food by which the craving of his stomach is
allayed,] in order that he may be quiet. (TA.)
It is said in a trad., accord. to different relations
thereof, that dates are the ↓ تَعِلَّة of the child or
of the guest. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, the first, accord.
to the copies of the K, What is drawn from the
udder after the first فِيقَة: but accord. to IAar,
what is drawn from the udder before the first فِيقَة
[or milk that collects in the udder between two
milkings], and before the second فيقة collects: also
termed عُرَاكَةٌ and دُلَاكَةٌ: (TA:) [or] the milking that is between two milkings: (S, O:) [or] it
signifies also the middle milking of the camel that
is milked in the first part and the middle and the
last part of the day: (K:) or, as some say, the
milk that she excerns [into her udder] after the
milking of the copious flow thereof. (TA.) ―

signifying “ high,” or “ higher,”] and is said to
be A place in the Seventh Heaven, to which ascend
the souls of the believers: or the most elevated of
the Paradises; like as سِجِّين is the most elevated
of the places of the fires [of Hell]: or rather it is
properly a name of the inhabitants thereof; for
this [sort of] pl. is peculiar to rational beings:
(TA:) it is mentioned again in art. علو [in which
see other explanations]. (K, TA.)
عَلَّانٌ Ignorant: (O, K:) so in the saying, أَنَا
عَلَّانٌ بِأَرْضِ كَذَا وَكَذَا [I am ignorant of such

عَالَّةٌ and [its pls.] عَوَالُّ and عَلَّى epithets applied to camels [as meaning Taking, or having
taken, a second draught; and so the first applied
to a single she-camel]. (TA.) It is said in a
prov., عَرَضَ عَلَىَّ سَوْمَ عَالَّةٍ [He offered to me in
the manner of offering water to those (camels)
taking, or having taken, a second draught]; (S,
O, K, TA; in the CK, عُرِضَ and سَوْمُ;) applied
to one who offers food to him who does not need
it; like the saying of the vulgar, عَرْضَ سَابِرِىٍّ;
(TA;) i. e., without energy; for one does not
offer drink to the عالّة with energy, as one does
to the نَاهِلَة [or those taking, or having taken,
the first draught]. (S, O, K, TA. [See also
Freytag's Arab. Prov. ii. 84.])

مُعَلِّلٌ Giving to drink time after time. (K.)
―
-b2-  And [hence,] That diverts with the saliva him
who sucks it in [when kissing]; thus in a verse of
Imra-el-Keys, accord. to one relation thereof;
(O, and Har p. 566;) as expl. by Az; and thus,
with ة, applied to a female: (Har:) but accord.
to IAar, that aids with kindness after kindness
(بِالْبِرِّ بَعْدَ البِرِّ [in Har على البرء بعد البرء]): another reading of the word in that verse, المُعَلَّل,
has been expl. above, voce عَلِيلٌ, on the authority
of AA. (O.) ―
-b3-  Also Plucking fruit time after
time. (K.) ―
-b4-  And One who repels the collector
of the [tax called] خَرَاج with excuses. (IAar, M,

of the days called أَيَّامُ العَجُوزِ; [respecting which
see art. عجز;] (S, O, K, TA;) because it diverts
men by somewhat of an alleviation of the cold:
(S, O, TA:) or, accord. to some, it is called
مُحَلِّلْ. (TA.)
مَعْلُولٌ: see عَلِيلٌ:
-A2-  and see عِلَّةٌ: and also 1,
last sentence.
يَعْلُولٌ A pool of water left by a torrent, white,
and flowing in a regular, or continuous, course,
one portion following another: (As, O, K, TA:)
or, accord. to Suh, in the R, [simply] a pool of
water left by a torrent; so called because it
waters the ground a second time (يَعُلُّ الأَرْضَ بِمَائِهِ
[after its having been watered by the rain]): pl.
يَعَالِيلُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And A dye (صِبْغ) that is imbided (عُلَّ) one time after another: (O, K:) or,
accord. to 'Abd-El-Lateef El-Baghdádee, a garment, or piece of cloth, dyed, and dyed again.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  Accord. to AA, [app. as applied to
camels,] يَعَالِيلُ signifies That have drunk one
time after another; and has no sing.: but it is
said on other authority to signify that go away at
random to pasture (اَلَّتِى تَهْمِى) one time after
another; and to have for its sing. يَعْلُولٌ: and
some say that it signifies such as are excessive in
respect of whiteness. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Also, the sing.,
Rain after rain: (AO, O, K:) pl. as above.
(TA.) ―
-b5-  And the pl., (S, M, O, TA,) [accord.
to the context in the K the sing., which is clearly
wrong,] Bubbles (حَبَاب, M, K, TA, [in the CK
حُباب,] and نُفَّاخَات, S, O, K, [both, I think,
evidently meaning thus,]) upon water; (S, M, O,
K;) said to be from the falling of rain; and to
be used in a verse of Kaab Ibn-Zuheyr for ذَاتُ
يَعَالِيلَ as meaning having bubbles: (TA:) sing.
as above. (O.) ―
-b6-  And Clouds disposed one above
another; (S, O;) sing. as above: (S:) or [simply] clouds; so in the R; to which ISd adds containing rain: (TA:) or white clouds; (K, TA;
a meaning assigned in the K to the sing.;) but
this is said by Niftaweyh in explanation of the
phrase بِيضٌ يَعَالِيلُ in a verse of Kaab Ibn-Zuheyr
to which reference has been made above: (TA:)
or [the sing. signifies] a white portion of clouds.
(M, K.) ―
-b7-  The pl. is also said to signify Lofty
mountains; and Suh adds, from the upper parts
of which water descends. (TA.)
-A2-  Also, the
sing., A camel having two humps. (IAar, O, K.)
―
-b2-  And A camel such as is termed أَفِيل [q. v.]. (O.)
