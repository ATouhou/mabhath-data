The horse went along swiftly, (S, O, K, *) by
reason of briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness,
(O,) or from fear and the like: and ↓ مُعَاجَرَةٌ is
syn. with the inf. ns. of يَعْجِرُ used in this sense:
(K:) [so that one says in like manner ↓ مَرَّ يُعَاجِرُ:]
and one says also, الرَّجُلُ الرَّجُلَ ↓ عاجر, meaning
The man ran before the man, fleeing. (O, TA.)
―
-b5-  عَجَرَ, aor.
عَجِرَ, inf. n. عَجْرٌ, said of an ass, is

-b5-  And عَجْرٌ is also syn. with إِلْحَاحٌ; in
which sense, as in others, its aor. is said in the K

wearing it] in prayer, is forbidden: but another
explanation, which is, he wound the turban upon his
head so as to show the هَامَة [or crown of the head],
is more probable; as it is from مِعْجَرٌ, meaning
“ a piece of a cloth, like a fillet, wound upon the
round of a woman's head. ” (Mgh.) One says,
↓ هُوَ حَسَنُ المُعْتَجَرِ He is comely in respect of the
manner of winding the turban upon the head.

عَجُورٌ [A species of melon: accord. to Forskål,
(Flora Aegypt. Arab., pp. lxxvi. and 168,) this
name and عبدلّاوى are both applied to the
cucumis chate: but accord. to Delile, (Floræ
Aegypt. Illustr., no. 922,) the latter name is
thus applied; and عجور (written by him as
though it were عَجُّور, but it is without teshdeed,)
is the name of the fruit of this species of cucumis
while immature; so too says 'Abd-El-Lateef: (see
De Sacy's Transl. and Notes, pp. 35 and 127;
and p. 54 of the Ar. Text edited by White:) I
have, however, found the name عَجُور to be commonly applied to a species different from the

عبد,) as Sonnini asserts it to be, (in his Travels
in Upper and Lower Egypt, pp. 574 and 636 of
the Engl. Transl., 4to., London, 1800,) and differing therefrom in shape, being, as he describes
it, in some instances round, in some instances oval,
and in others much elongated: the name is probably derived from the Greek
ἀγγούριον (in
modern Greek a>ggouri), signifying the “ water-melon ”]: it is said in the Msb that قِثَّآء is a
name of what the [common] people call خِيَار and
عَجُور and فَقُّوس: but it is said [by some, not by
the author of the Msb,] that عَجُور signifies large

مِعْجَرٌ signifies a turban: or a turban [wound]
upon the head without a turning [of a portion
thereof] beneath the jaw: (Ham p. 709:) its pl. is
مَعَاجِرُ: whence الاِعْتِجَارُ. (L, TA.) ―
-b2-  And
مِعْجَرٌ signifies also A kind of garment, or cloth,
