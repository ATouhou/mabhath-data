عَقُ3َ, (TA,) inf. n.
عَقٌّ, (Mgh, O, Msb, TA,) He clave, split, slit,
ripped, or rent; (Mgh, O, Msb, K, TA;) and
he cut. (Mgh, O, TA.) You say, عَقَّ ثَوْبَهُ He
slit, ripped, or rent, his garment. (Msb.) And
عُقَّتْ تَمِيمَتُهُ فِى بَنِى فُلَانٍ [His amulet was cut
off among the sons of such a one]; said of a boy
when he has attained to the prime of manhood,
and become strong, with a tribe; originating
from the fact that as long as the boy was an infant, his mother hung upon him amulets to preserve him from the evil eye; and when he became
full-grown, they were cut off from him: whence
the saying of a poet,
بِلَادٌ بِهَا عَقَّ الشَّبَابُ تَمِيمَتِى
وَأَوَّلُ أَرْضٍ مَسَّ جِلْدِى تُرَابُهَا
[A country in which the attaining to the prime of
manhood cut off my amulet, and the first land of
which the dust touched my skin]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
[hence,] عَقَّتِ الرِّيحُ المُزْنَ, aor. and inf. n. as
above, The wind drew forth a shower of fine rain
from the مزن [or clouds containing water]; as
though it rent them. (TA.) And عُقَّتِ السَّحَابَةُ
The cloud poured forth its water; [as though it
were rent;] and ↓ اِنْعَقَّت [means the same];
(TA;) and ↓ اعتقّت [likewise]. (O.) ―
-b3-  And
عَقَّ عَنْ وَلَدِهِ, (S, Msb,) or عَنِ المَوْلُودِ, (K,)
aor.
عَقُ3َ (S, Msb, TA) and
عَقِ3َ, (TA,) inf. n. عَقٌّ, (S,
Msb,) He slaughtered as a sacrifice (S, Msb, K,
TA) for his child, (S, Msb,) or for the new-born
child, (K,) a sheep or goat, (T, Msb, TA,) [generally the latter,] on the seventh day after the birth.
(T, S, Msb, TA.) And He shaved the [hair
termed] عَقِيقَة [q. v.] (S, TA) of his child, (S,)
or of the new-born child. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And عَقَّ بِالسَّهْمِ
He shot the arrow towards the sky; and that
arrow was called عَقِيقَةٌ; (S, O, K;) and it was
the arrow of self-excuse: they used to do thus in
the Time of Ignorance [on the occasion of a demand for blood-revenge]; and if the arrow returned smeared with blood, they were not content
save with the retaliation of slaughter; but if it
returned clean, they stroked their beards, and
made reconciliation on the condition of the bloodwit; the stroking of the beards being a sign of
reconciliation: the arrow, however, as IAar says,
did not [ever] return otherwise than clean: (S,
O:) the origin was this: a man of the tribe was
slain, and the slayer was prosecuted for his blood;
whereupon a company of the chief men [of the
family of the slayer] collected themselves together
to the heirs [who claimed satisfaction for the
blood] of the slain, and offered the bloodwit, asking forgiveness for the blood; and if the heir
[who claimed satisfaction and who acted for himself and his coheirs] was a strong man, impatient
of injury, he refused to take the bloodwit; but if
weak, he consulted the people of his tribe, and
then said to the petitioners, “We have, between
us and our Creator, a sign denoting command
and prohibition: we take an arrow, and set it on
a bow, and shoot it towards the sky; and if it
return to us smeared with blood, we are forbidden
to take the bloodwit, and are not content save
with the retaliation of slaughter; but if it return
clean, as it went up, we are commanded to take
the bloodwit: ” so they made reconciliation; for
this arrow never returned otherwise than clean;
and thus they had an excuse in the opinion of the
ignorant of them. (L, TA.) A poet (S, O, TA)
of the family of the slain, said by some to be of
Hudheyl, by IB to be El-As'ar El-Joafee, who
was absent from this reconciliation, (TA,) says,
عَقُّوا بِسَهْمٍ ثُمَّ قَالُوا صَالِحُوا
يَا لَيْتَنِى فِى القَوْمِ إِذْ مَسَحُوا الِلُّحَى
[They shot an arrow towards the sky; them they
said, “Make ye reconciliation: ” would that I
were among the party when they stroked the
beards]: (S, O, TA:) or, as some relate it, the
first word is عَقَّوْا, with fet-h to the ق; which belongs to the class of unsound verbs [i. e. to art.
عقى]. (S, O.) ―
-b5-  One says also, عَقَّ وَالِدَهُ, (S,
O, K,) or أَبَاهُ, (Msb,) aor.
عَقُ3َ, (S, O, Msb,) inf. n.
عُقُوقٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and مَعَقَّةٌ (S, O, K) and
عَقٌّ, (TA,) He was undutiful, disobedient, refractory, or ill-mannered, to his parent, or father;
contr. of بَرَّهُ; (K;) he broke his compact of obedience to his parent, or father; (TA;) he disobeyed his father; and failed, or neglected, to behave to him in a good, or comely, manner. (Msb.)
And عَقَّ الرَّحِمَ, (TA, and Ham p. 93,) like قَطَعَهَا
[i. e. He severed the tie, or ties, of relationship, by
unkind behaviour to his kindred]. (Ham ib.) And
عَقَّ [alone], aor.
عَقُ3َ, inf. n. عُقُوقٌ, [He was undutiful, &c.; or he acted undutifully, &c.; or] he
contravened, or opposed, him whom he was under
an obligation to obey. (Har p. 158.) عُقُوقُ
الوَالِدَيْنِ [Undutiful treatment, &c., of the two
parents] is said in a trad. to be one of the great
sins. (O.) And it is said in a prov., العُقُوقُ
أَحَدُ الثُّكْلَيْنِ [Undutiful treatment of a parent is
one of the two sorts of being bereft of a child]: or,
as some relate it, العُقُوقُ ثُكْلُ مَنْ لَمْ يَثْكَلْ [Undutiful treatment of a parent is (like) the bereavement of him who is not (really) bereft of his child]:
i. e. he whom his children have treated undutifully (مِنْ عَقَّهُ وَلَدُهُ) is as though he were bereft
of his children although they are living. (O.)
[See also 3: and 4.] ―
-b6-  Hence, from عُقُوقُ
الوَالِدَيْنِ, the verb is metaphorically used in the
saying, in a trad., مَثَلُكُمْ وَمَثَلُ عَائِشَةَ مَثَلُ العَيْنِ
فِى الرَّأْسِ تُؤْذِى صَاحِبَهَا وَلَا يَسْتَطِيعُ أَنْ يَعُقَّهَا إِلَّا
بِالَّذِى هُوَ خَيْرٌ لَهَا (tropical:)  [The similitude of you and of
'Áïsheh is that of the eye in the head, when it hurts
its owner, and he cannot treat it severely save with
that which is good for it: app. meaning that her
severity was for the good of the objects thereof].
(TA.)
-A2-  عَقَّ, intrans., said of lightning: see 7.
-A3-  عَقَّتْ said of a mare, and of an ass: see 4.
-A4-
عَقَّتِ الدَّلْوُ, inf. n. عَقُّ, means The bucket came up
full from the well; and some of the Arabs say
عَقَّت as having تَعْقِيَةٌ for its inf. n.; but it is [said
to be] originally ↓ عَقَّقَت, the third ق being
changed into ى, [which is then in this case suppressed,] like as they said تَظَنَّيْتُ from الظَّنُّ: [it
is, however, mentioned in the TA in art. عقو also,
and there expl. as meaning it rose in the well
turning round: and from what here follows, it
appears to mean it rose swiftly, cleaving the air:]
a poet, cited by IAar, says, of a bucket,
عَقَّتْ كَمَا عَقَّتْ دَلُوفُ العِقْبَانٌ
meaning It clave [the air of] the well, rising
swiftly, like the hastening of the swift eagle in its
flight towards the prey. (TA in the present art.)

3
عَاقَقْتُ فُلَانًا, aor. أُعَاقُّهُ, inf. n. عِقَاقٌ, I contravened, or opposed, such a one. (TA.) [See also

did that which was an act of undutifulness, disobedience, refractoriness, or ill manners, to his
father or the like]. (S, TA.) [See also عَقَّ وَالِدَهُ,

-b2-  And
you say, مَا أَعَقَّهُ لِوَالِدِهِ [How undutiful, disobedient,
refractory, or ill-mannered, is he to his father!].
(TA.)
-A2-  اعقّت She (a mare, S, O, K, and an
ass, TA) conceived, or became pregnant; (S, O,
K;) or she did not conceive, or become pregnant,
after having been covered by the stallion, or

and ↓ عَقَّتْ, aor.
عَقِ3َ, (O, K, TA,) the verb being
of the class of ضَرَبَ, (TA,) inf. n. عَقَاقٌ and عَقَقٌ
(O, K, TA) and عُقُوقٌ, (CK, but not in other
copies,) signifies the same, (O, * K, TA,) said of
a mare, (O, K,) and of an ass; (O;) or عَقَاقٌ
signifies pregnancy itself, as also عِقَاقٌ, (K,) and
عَقَقٌ; (S, O;) or عَقَّتْ signifies she became pregnant; and اعقّت, the [hair called] عَقِيقَة grew in

and ↓ عَقَّ [of which latter the aor. is probably
يَعَقُّ, and the inf. n. عَقَقٌ, said in the K to mean
اِنْشِقَاقٌ,] signify تَشَقَّقَ and اِنْشَقَّ [as though meaning The lightning became cloven]; (TA;) [but]
the former is expl. as signifying the lightning was,
or became, in a state of commotion (تَضَرَّبَ) in the
clouds. (S, O.) [Another meaning is suggested
by an explanation of عَقِيقَةٌ (q. v.) in relation to
lightning.] ―

R. Q. 1
عَقْعَقَ بِصَوْتِهِ, (O, TA,) inf. n. عَقْعَقَةٌ,
(S, O,) said of the عَقْعَق [or magpie], It uttered
a [kind of chattering] cry, (S, * O, TA,) resembling the sound of ع and ق [or the repeated sound

accord. to the K, there said to be with kesr, but

originally an inf. n.; thus in the L. (TA.) ―
-b2-
And A blaze of lightning extending in an elongated form in the sky, (IDrd, O, K,) or in the

K, TA.)
عِقَّةٌ: see عَقِيقَةٌ, in the former half.
عَقَقٌ: see عَقَاقٌ. ―
-b2-  It is said in the K to be
syn. with عَاقٌّ; but in this sense the correct word

عُقُقٌ, as a sing. and as a pl.: see عَاقٌّ.
عَقَاقٌ is an inf. n. of عَقَّتْ said of a mare (O, K)

a [proper] name for العُقُوقُ [Undutifulness, disobedience, refractoriness, or ill manners, to a
parent, or the like]: (K, TA:) mentioned by IB,

they meant that she would become pregnant:
(TA:) it is extr.; [as being from أَعَقَّتْ;] and
one should not say ↓ مُعِقٌّ; or this is a bad dial.
var.; (S, O, K;) or, accord. to AA, it is from
اعقّت, and عَقُوقٌ is from عَقَّتْ: (TA:) the pl. is
عُقُقٌ, and عِقَاقٌ is a pl. pl., (S, O, K,) i. e. pl. of
عُقُقٌ. (S, O.) It is said in a prov., طَلَبَ الأَبْلَقَ
العَقُوقَ, meaning He sought an impossible thing;
because ابلق is applied to a male, and عقوق
means pregnant: (S, O, and K in art. بلق) or
الابلق العقوق means the dawn, because it breaks,
lit, cleaves. (O, and K in art. بلق.) ―
-b2-  نَوَى
العَقُوقِ means Date-stones that are easily broken,
(Lth, S, O, K,) soft to be chewed; (Lth, O, K;)
which are given as provender to camels, (S,) or
to the pregnant thereof, in consideration of her
state, wherefore they are thus called; and which
are eaten, or chewed, by the old woman; but
this is of the speech of the people of El Basrah,
and not known by the Arabs in their desert:
(Lth, O:) and sometimes they called a single
date-stone of this sort ↓ عَقِيقَةٌ. (S.)
-A2-  See also

Et-Teefáshee to be brought from mines thereof at
San'à, (TA,) and on the shores of the Sea of
Roomeeyeh; one kind thereof is of a turbid
appearance, like water running from salted flesh-meat, and having in it faint white lines, (K, TA,)
and this, Et-Teefáshee says, is what is known by
the appellation الرطبى [so in my original]; the
best kind is the red; then, the yellow; then, the
white; and the other kinds are bad: or, as some
say, the streaked (المُشَطَّب) is the best: (TA:)
[I omit some absurd assertions in the K and TA
respecting various virtues supposed to be possessed
by this stone:] the n. un. is with ة: and the pl.
is عَقَائِقُ. (O, K.) [العَقِيقُ اليَمَانِىُّ is an appel-lation applied by some to The agate.]
عَقِيقَةٌ [a subst. from عَقِيقٌ, made so by the affix
ة. Hence, because cleft, or furrowed, in the
earth,] A river, or rivulet. (IAar, O, K.) ―
-b2-

its being rent from a garment, or piece of cloth.
(IAar, O, K.) ―

A [leathern water-bag such as is commonly called]
مَزَادَة. (IAar, O, K.) ―
-b5-  Also The wool of a
جَذَع [or sheep in or before its second year]: (S,
O, K, TA:) that of a ثَنِىّ [or sheep in its third
year] is called جَنِيبَةٌ: (TA:) and the hair of a
young one recently born, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,
TA,) that comes forth upon his head in his
mother's belly, (TA,) of human beings, (S, Mgh,
O, Msb, K, TA,) because it is cut off on his
seventh day, (Mgh,) and of others, (Msb,) [i. e.]
of beasts likewise; (S, O, K, TA;) as also ↓ عَقِيقٌ
and ↓ عِقَّةٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;) but A 'Obeyd says
that he had not heard this last except in relation
to human beings and asses: (S, O, K: *) its pl.
(i. e. the pl. of عِقَّةٌ) is عِقَقٌ: (O, K:) [the pl. of
عَقِيقَةٌ and عَقِيقٌ is عَقَائِقُ: a law of the Sunneh
requires that the عَقِيقَة of an infant should be
weighed, and its weight in silver be given to
the poor: (and Herodotus, in ii. 65, mentions a
similar custom as obtaining among the Ancient
Egyptians:)] when the hair has once fallen from
the young [by its being cut], the term عَقِيقَةٌ ceases
to be applied to it: so says Lth: (O, TA:) but
it occurs in a trad. applied to hair as being likened
to the hair of a recently-born infant. (TA.) ―
-b6-
Hence, (S, O,) it is applied also to The sheep, or
goat, [generally the latter,] that is slaughtered (S,
Mgh, O, Msb, K) as a sacrifice for the recentlyborn infant (S, Mgh, Msb) on the occasion of the
shaving of the infant's hair (O, K) on the seventh
day after his birth, (S, Msb,) and of which the
limbs are divided, and cooked with water and salt,
and given as food to the poor: (Lth, TA:) Z
holds it to be thus called from the same word as
applied to the hair: but it is said [by some] to
be so called because it is slaughtered by cutting
the windpipe and gullet and the two external
jugular veins: (TA:) the Prophet disallowed
this appellation, (Mgh, Msb,) as being of evil
omen, (Mgh,) or as though he saw them to
regard it as of evil omen, (Msb,) and desired
them to use نَسِيكَةٌ in its stead; (Mgh, Msb, TA;)
saying I like not العُقُوق. (TA.) ―
-b7-  عَقِيقَةُ البَرْقِ
signifies What remains [for an instant] in the
clouds, of the rays, or beams, of lightning; (Lth,
O, K;) as also ↓ العُقَقُ; (K;) which, as well as
العَقِيقَةُ, is also expl. as meaning lightning which
one sees in the midst of the clouds, resembling a
drawn sword: (TA:) or عَقِيقَةُ البَرْقِ signifies
lightning in a state of commotion in the clouds:
(S, O:) or lightning extending in an elongated
form in the side, or breadth, of the clouds:
(TA:) or lightning that cleaves the clouds, and
extends high, into the midst of the sky, without
going to the right and left: (S in art. خفو:) or,
as expl. by Aboo-Sa'eed, a flash of lightning that
has spread in the horizon: (O, voce شَقِيقَةٌ:) a
sword is likened thereto: (S, O, K:) and [the
pl.] عَقَائِقُ is a name for swords: (O, K:) ↓ عَقِيقٌ,
also, signifies lightning. (TA.) ―
-b8-  And عَقِيقَةٌ
signifies also An arrow shot towards the sky;
(S, O, K;) the arrow of self-excuse; which was
used in the manner described in the explanation
of the phrase عَقَّ بِالسَّهْمِ [q. v.]. (S, O.) ―
-b9-  See
also عَقُوقٌ, last signification.
سَحَابَةٌ عَقَّاقَةٌ A cloud pouring forth its water:
(TA:) or a cloud much rent by water. (T, TA
voce هَيْدَبٌ.)
عِقَّانٌ Shoots that come forth from the أُصُول
[meaning trunks, or stems,] of palm-trees and of
grape-vines; (S, O, K;) and which, if not cut
off, cause the اصول to become vitiated, or unsound.

عَقْعَقٌ [The magpie, corvus pica; so called in
the present day;] a certain bird, (S, O, Msb,
K,) well known, (S, O,) of the size of the pigeon,
(Msb,) party-coloured, black and white, (O, Msb,
K,) having a long tail, (O, Msb,) said by Is-hák
El-Mowsilee to be the same that is called شَجَجَى,
(Th, IB, TA,) a species of crow, (IAth, Msb,
TA,) wherefore it is said in a trad. that the man
in the state of إِحْرَام may kill it; (IAth, TA;)
its cry resembles the sound of ع and ق [or the
repeated sound of عَقْ]; (O, K;) and the Arabs
regard it as an evil omen. (Msb.) [See also
صُرَدٌ.]
عَاقٌّ Undutiful, disobedient, refractory, or illmannered, to his parent, or father; (S, * O, * K;)
breaking, or one who breaks, his compact of obedience to his parent, or father; (TA;) disobeying,
or disobedient to, his father; and failing, or neglecting, to behave to him in a good, or comely,
manner; (Msb;) [and severing, or one who severs,
the tie, or ties, of relationship, by unkind behaviour
to his kindred; (see its verb;)] and ↓ عَقٌّ signifies
the same; (O, K;) as also ↓ عُقَقٌ, (S, O, TA,)
but in an intensive sense, altered from عَاقٌّ, like
غُدَر and فُسَق from غَادِر and فَاسِق, in the K erroneously said to be عَقَقٌ; (TA;) and ↓ عُقُقٌ; (L,
and TA as from the K, but not in my MS.
copy of the K nor in the CK;) which last signifies also [as a pl.] men severing, or who sever, the
ties of relationship, by unkind behaviour to their
kindred; and also remote, or distant, enemies:
(TA:) [and ↓ عَقُوقٌ is app. used (as Freytag asserts it to be) in the sense of عَاقٌّ in the Fákihet
el-Khulatà, p. 55, 1. 7 from the bottom:] the pl.
of عَاقٌّ is عَقَقَةٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) like كَفَرَةٌ, (S,)
and عُقَّقٌ, like رُكَّعٌ, a form used by Ru-beh, (O,)
and أَعِقَّةٌ, which is an extr. [meaning anomalous]
pl. (Ham p. 93.) ↓ ذُقٌ عُقَقُ, (S, O,) in a trad.,
(S,) said by Aboo-Sufyán to Hamzeh on the day
of Ohod, when he passed by him slain, (S, * O,)
means ذُقٌ جَزَآءَ فِعْلِكَ [Taste thou the recompense
of thy deed], (S,) or ذُقِ القَتْلَ [taste thou slaughter],
(O,) يَا عَاقُّ [O undutiful, &c.; or, accord. to the
explanation in the TA mentioned above, عُقَقُ,
for يَا عُقَقُ, means O very undutiful, &c.]. (S, O.)
عَوَاقُّ النَّخْلِ The shoots, or offsets, of the palmtrees, that grow forth therewith. (O, K.) [See
also عِقَّانٌ.]
أَعَقُّ مِنْ ضَبٍّ [More undutiful, &c., to kindred,
than a lizard of the species called ضبّ] is a prov.
[mentioned, but not expl., in the O]: IAar says,
the female [of the ضبّ] is meant; and its عُقُوق
consists in its eating its young ones. (TA.) [See
also Freytag's Arab. Prov. ii. 152-3. And see
an ex. of أَعَقُّ in a verse cited in art. زهد,
conj. 2.]
مُعِقٌّ: see عَقُوقٌ.
مَعْقُوقٌ: see عَقِيقٌ, first sentence.
