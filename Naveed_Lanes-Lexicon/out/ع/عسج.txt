meaning يَخْتِلُنِى بِالعَوْسَجَةِ يَحْسَبُنِى لَا أُبْصِرُهُ [He
conceals himself, to seize me, by means of the
'owsajeh: thinking that I shall not see him:

to be understood as occasioned by the terror of
the man; for the words of the explanation may

the verse]. (TA.)

says, describing his she-camel,
وَالعِيسُ مِنْ عَاسِجٍ أَوْ وَاسِجٍ خَبَبًا
يُنْحَزْنَ مِنْ جَانِبَيْهَا وَهْىَ تَنْسَلِبُ
[And the reddish, or yellowish, or dingy, white
camels, of a sort that goes the pace termed عَسْج, or
of a sort that goes the pace termed وَسْج, with a quick
running, are struck with the feet on their sides,
but she outstrips]: he means, the camels go
swiftly, struck with the feet in their course, but
do not overtake my she-camel. (S, O.)
عَوْسَجٌ [The lycium, or box-thorn; of several
species; but now particularly applied to the lycium
Europæum of Linn.: accord. to Sprengel (Hist.
rei herb. p. 252, as stated by Freytag), applied
to the zizyphus spina Christi, which is the rhamnus spina Christi of Linn.; but this is the سِدْر:]
a species of thorn: (S, O, K: *) certain trees of
the thorn-kind, (L,) having a round red fruit [or
berry] like the carnelian-bead, (O, L,) which is
sweet, and is eaten: (O:) or a species of thorntrees having a bitter red fruit in which is acidity,
called مُصْعٌ: (Msb:) or certain trees having many
thorns, and of several species, whereof is one that
produces a red fruit, called مُصْعٌ, in which is
acidity: (T:) when it grows large, it is called
غَرْقَدٌ: (O, Msb:) and because of the softness of
its wood, the women of the Arabs of the desert
make of it spindles for spinning wool: (O:) the
n. un. is with ة: (S, O, Msb: [in the K, عَوْسَجٌ
is termed the pl. of عَوْسَجَةٌ:]) and it is said that
the pl. of the n. un. is عَوَاسِجُ: (TA:) ISd says,
the genuine عَوْسَج is short between the knots, hard
in the wood, small in the leaves, and does not grow
large, and this is the best sort: thus says AHn:
(L:) some say that it is the عليق [i. e. عُلَّيْق,
q. v.]: Dioscorides says, it is a tree that grows
in tracts that exude water and produce salt,
having erect thorny branches, and leaves somewhat
long, overspread with a moist viscous substance:
and there is another species, whiter than this: and
another species, of which the leaves are blacker
than those of the former, and wider, inclining a
little to redness, and its branches are long, their
length being about five cubits, and having more
numerous thorns, and weaker, and less sharp,
and its fruit is wide and thin, as though it were in
sheaths: and the عوسج has a fruit like the توث
[or mulberry], which is eaten: it grows mostly in
cold, or cool, countries. (Avicenna [Ibn-Seenà],
book ii. p. 232. [In this extract from Dioscorides,
in the original, are some unimportant words
which I have passed over, including two imperfectly printed, and unintelligible: and what is
said in it respecting the fruit I think doubtful, as
being inapplicable to the fruit of the box-thorn.])
مِعْسَاجٌ an epithet applied to a camel [app.
meaning That stretches out his neck much in going
along: or that goes the pace termed عَسْج much or
well]. (S, O, K.)
