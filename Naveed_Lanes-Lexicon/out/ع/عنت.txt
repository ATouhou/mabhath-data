عنت1
عَنِتَ, [aor.
عَنَتَ,] inf. n. عَنَتٌ, He fell into a
difficult, hard, or distressing, case: (S, A, * O,
TA:) or عَنَتٌ signifies the meeting with difficulty,
hardship, or distress. (K.) [This is held by some
to be the primary signification: see عَنَتْ below;
by the explanations of which it seems to be indicated that the verb has several significations
that are not expressly assigned to it in the lexicons.] عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ, in the Kur [ix. last
verse but one], means, accord. to Az [and most
of the expositors], Grievous unto him is your
experiencing difficulty, or hardship, or distress:
or, as some say, the meaning is ↓ مَا أَعْنَتَكُمْ, i. e.,
what hath brought you into difficulty, or hardship,
or distress. (TA. [In the S and O, it seems to
be indicated by the context that مَا عَنِتُّمْ means
your having sinned.]) ―
-b2-  عَنِتَتِ الدَّابَّةُ The beast
limped, or halted, in consequence of hard, or
rough, treatment, such as it could not bear. (TA.)
It is said in a trad., أَنْعَلَ دَابَّتَهُ فَعَنِتَتْ He shod
his beast and it became lame: thus as some
relate it; as others relate it, فَعَتَبَتْ; but the
former relation is preferred by Kt. (TA.) ―
-b3-
عَنِتَ said of a bone, (Az, A, K, TA,) and عَنِتَتْ
said of an arm or a leg, (Az, TA,) [aor.
عَنَتَ,]
inf. n. عَنَتٌ, (TA,) It broke (Az, A, K, TA)
after its having been set and united: (A, K:)
[this is said in the Ksh and by Bd, in iv. 30, to
be the primary signification:] and the former,
said of a bone, it became weak, and broke. (K, *
TA.) ―
-b4-  عَنِتَ, (S, O, Msb, TA,) aor.
عَنَتَ, (Msb,)
inf. n. عَنَتٌ, (S, * O, * Msb, K, * TA,) He committed a sin, a crime, or an act of disobedience
deserving punishment: (S, O, K, * TA: *) or he
committed sins, crimes, or acts of disobedience
deserving punishment: (K, * TA:) or he did wrong
[intentionally or unintentionally]. (Msb.) [And
particularly He committed fornication, or adultery: see عَنَتٌ below.]
2
عنّتهُ, inf. n. تَعْنِيتٌ, He treated him with
hardness, severity, or rigour, and constrained him
to do that which was difficult to him to perform;
(IAmb, O, K, TA;) as also ↓ تعنّتهُ: and afterwards it became applied to signify he destroyed
him; or caused him to perish: (IAmb, TA:)
[and ↓ اعنتهُ has both of these significations: for
it is said that] لَوْ شَآءَ اللّٰهُ لَأَعْنَتَكُمْ, in the Kur
[ii. 219], means If God had willed, He would
assuredly have treated you with hardness, &c.,
and constrained you to do that which would be
difficult to you to perform: or it may mean,
would have destroyed you: or, accord. to IAar,
إِعْنَاتٌ signifies the requiring to do that which is
not in one's power. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also 5.
4
اعنتهُ, (inf. n. إِعْنَاتٌ, Mgh,) He caused him
to fall into difficulty, hardship, or distress; (S,
Mgh, O, Msb, K, TA;) into that which was difficult, hard, or distressing, to him to bear. (Mgh,
Msb.) See also 1, and 2. ―
-b2-  He (the rider)
treated him (i. e. a beast) with hardness, or roughness, such as the latter could not bear, and so
caused him to limp, or halt. (TA.) ―
-b3-  He (a
physician) treated him (i. e. a sick man) roughly,
or without gentleness, and so harmed, or injured,
him. (A, O. *) ―
-b4-  He, or it, broke it (i. e. a bone)
after it had been set and united: (Az, S, A,. O,
K, TA:) or he (a bone-setter) treated it (i. e. a
broken bone) roughly, or ungently, so that the
fracture became worse. (TA.)
5
تعنّتهُ: see 2. Accord. to AHeyth, (TA,)
He brought upon him annoyance, molestation,
harm, or hurt: (Msb, TA:) or he sought to occasion him difficulty, hardship, or distress. (Mgh.)
And hence, (Mgh,) He asked him respecting a
thing, desiring by doing so to involve him in confusion, or doubt; (A, Mgh, TA;) as when one
says to a witness, “Where was this, and when
was it, and what garment was upon him when
thou tookest upon thyself to bear witness? ” and
الشُّهُودَ ↓ يُعَنِّتُ and يَتَعَنَّتُ عَلَى الشُّهُودِ are also
mentioned; but these require consideration.
(Mgh.)
R. Q.1

goat a year old], It rose, or rose high. (O, K.)
―
-b2-  عنتت عَنْهُ He turned away from, avoided, or
shunned, him, or it. (O, K.)
عَنَتٌ [inf. n. of 1, q. v.: and also expl. as having
the following meanings:] Difficulty, hardship, or
distress: (A, IAth, Mgh, Msb, TA:) this is [said
to be] the primary signification: (Jel in iv. 30:)
or severe difficulty, or hardship, or distress: (Zj,
TA:) or the coming of difficulty or hardship or
distress upon a man. (K.) ―
-b2-  A state of perdition or destruction. (A, IAth, K, TA.) ―
-b3-  A
bad, an evil, or a corrupt, state: or bad, evil, or
corrupt, conduct or doing: syn. فَسَادٌ [which has
both of these meanings; and may here have the
former meaning as nearly agreeing with what
precedes it, or the latter meaning as nearly agreeing with what follows it]. (A, IAth, K, TA.)
―
-b4-  A sin, a crime, or an act of disobedience
deserving punishment; (AHeyth, S, A, IAth, O,
K, TA;) and so ↓ مَعْنَتَةٌ. (A.) ―

[intentional or unintentional]; an error; mistake. (IAth, Msb, * TA.) ―
-b6-  ―
-b7-  Fornication, or
adultery: (S, IAth, Mgh, O, Msb, K, TA:) but
this is a conventional explanation of the lecturers
of the colleges. (Mgh.) So in the Kur [iv. 30],
where it is said, ذٰلِكَ لِمَنْ خَشِىَ الْعَنَتَ مِنْكُمْ [That
is for him, among you, who fears the commission
of fornication]: (S, O, Msb, TA: [and the like
is said in the Mgh:]) this, says Az, was revealed
in relation to him who might not have the means
of taking to wife a free woman; therefore it was
allowed to him to take to wife a slave: (Msb,
TA:) or the meaning of العنت here is perdition:
or perdition in [or by means of] fornication. (TA.)
―
-b8-  Also Wrongful, unjust, injurious, or tyrannical,
conduct: and annoyance, molestation, harm, or
hurt. (AHeyth, TA.) And Distressing, grievous,
or afflicting, harm, injury, hurt, or mischief.
(TA.) ―
-b9-  And accord. to the 'Ináyeh, Contention; or contention for superiority in greatness:
and persistence in opposition, or in vain contention.
(TA.)
عَنِتٌ A bone broken after its having been set
and united; as also ↓ مُعْنَتٌ. (S, O, K.)
عَنُوتٌ A hill (أَكَمَةٌ) difficult of ascent; (O,
Msb, * K;) as also ↓ عُنْتُوتٌ: (O, K:) or high,
and difficult of ascent. (A.)
عُنْتُوتٌ: see what next precedes. ―
-b2-  With the
article ال, A mountain, (O,) or tapering mountain, (K,) in the صَحْرَآء [or desert]: (O, K:) or,
accord. to the L, a small mountain tapering into
[or towards] the sky (جُبَيْلٌ مُسْتَدِقٌّ فِى السَّمَآءِ):
and it is said to be دون الحرة [app. دُونَ الحَرَّةِ;
but there seems to be here an omission or a mistranscription; for of the various meanings that
may be assigned to this phrase, none seems to be
apposite: I incline to think that العُنْتُوتُ thus
expl. is the proper name of a particular mountain]. (TA.)
-A2-  عُنْتُوتٌ signifies also The notch
in a bow: accord. to Az, (TA,) the عُنْتُوت of the
bow is the notch into which enters the غَانَة, i. e. the
ring at the head of the string. (O, TA.)
-A3-  And
The first, or beginning, or commencement, of anything. (O, K.)
-A4-  And Dry حَلِىّ, (O, and so
in the CK, [in my MS. copy of the K حَلْى, and
thus accord. to the TA, but this is evidently a
mistake,]) which is a certain plant. (TA.)
عَانِتٌ an epithet applied to a woman, i. q. عَانِسٌ
[q. v.]: (O, K:) said to be formed [from the
latter] by substitution, or a dial. var., or a word
mispronounced. (MF, TA.)

مَعْنَتَةٌ: see عَنَتٌ. [Its primary signification
seems to be A cause of difficulty, hardship, or
distress; &c.]
جَآءَنِى فُلَانٌ مُتَعَنِّتًا Such a one came to me seeking [to cause] my fall into a wrong action, or an
error. (S, O, K. *)
