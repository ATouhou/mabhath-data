عقل1
عَقڤلَ [The inf. n.] عَقْلٌ signifies The act of withholding, or restraining; syn. مَنْعٌ. (TA.) [This
is app. the primary signification, or it may be
from what next follows.] ―
-b2-  عَقَلَ البَعِيرَ, (S, Mgh,
O, Msb, K,) aor.
عَقِلَ, (S, O, Msb,) inf. n. عَقْلٌ, (S,
Mgh, O, Msb,) He bound the camel with the [rope
called] عِقَال; (Mgh;) meaning he bound the
camel's fore shank to his arm; (K;) i. e. he
folded together the camel's fore shank and his
arm and bound them both in the middle of the
arm with the rope called عِقَال; (S, O, Msb;)
and ↓ اعتقلهُ signifies the same; as also ↓ عقّلهُ;
(K;) or you say, عَقَّلْتُ الإِبِلَ, from العِقَالُ, (S, O,)
inf. n. تَعْقِيلٌ, (O,) [i. e. I bound the camels in the
manner expl. above,] this verb being with tesh-deed because of its application to a number of
objects: (S, O:) and sometimes the hocks were
bound with the عِقَال. (TA.) The she-camel,
also, was bound with the عِقَال on the occasion of
her being covered: ―
-b3-  and hence العَقْلُ is metonymically used as meaning الجِمَاعُ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The
act of compressing a woman]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  عَقَلْتُ
القَتِيلَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *) or المَقْتُولَ, (S, O,)
aor. as above, (TA,) and so the inf. n., (Msb, TA,)
means I gave, or paid, the bloodwit to the heir,
or next of kin, of the slain person: (S, Mgh, O,
Msb, K: *) for the camels [that constituted the
bloodwit] used to be bound with the عِقَال in the
yard of the abode of the heir, or next of kin, of
the slain person; and in consequence of frequency
of usage, the phrase became employed to mean
thus when the bloodwit was given in dirhems or
deenárs. (As, S, O, Msb. * [See a verse cited in
the first paragraph of art. عيف.]) And [hence]
one says also, عَقَلْتُ عَنْهُ, (inf. n. as above, TA,)
meaning I paid for him, (the slayer, Mgh,) i. e.,
in his stead, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, *) the bloodwit
that was obligatory upon him, (S, Mgh, O, K, *)
or what was obligatory upon him of the bloodwit.
(Msb.) And عَقَلْتُ لَهُ دَمَ فُلَانٍ I relinquished in
his favour retaliation of the blood of such a one
for the bloodwit. (S, O, Msb, K. *) لَا تَعْقِلُ العَاقِلَةُ
عَمْدًا وَلَا عَبْدًا, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) in a trad.
(S, O, Msb) of Esh-Shaabee, (O,) or a saying of
Esh-Shaabee, (Mgh, * K,) not a trad., (K,) but
the like occurs in a trad. related on the authority
of I'Ab, (TA,) [meaning, accord. to an expl. of
the verb when trans. without a particle, mentioned
above, Those who are responsible for the payment
of a bloodwit in certain cases shall not pay it for
an intentional act of slaying or the like, nor for
the slaying or the like of a slave,] applies, accord.
to Aboo-Haneefeh, to the case of a slave's committing a crime against a free person: (S, O,
Msb, K: [and thus as expl. in the Mgh:]) but,
(S, O, Msb, K,) accord. to Ibn-Abee-Leylà, (S,
O, Msb,) it applies to the case of a free person's
committing a crime against a slave; for if the
meaning were as Aboo-Haneefeh says, the phrase
would be لَا تَعْقِلُ العَاقِلَةُ عَنْ عَبْدٍ; (S, O, Msb, K;)
and As pronounced this to be correct: (S, O,
Msb: *) Akmal-ed-Deen, however, in the Exposition of the Hidáyeh, says that عَقَلْتُهُ is used in
the sense of عَقَلْتُ عَنْهُ, and that the context of
the trad. indicates this meaning, which MF also
defends. (TA.) [See also the saying لَا أَعْقِلُ
الكَلْبَ الهَرَّارَ in art. هر.] ―
-b5-  عَقَلَهُ, inf. n. as above,
also means He set him up [app. a man] on one of
his legs; [app. from عَقَلَ البَعِيرَ;] as also عَكَلَهُ:
and every عَقْل is a raising. (TA.) ―
-b6-  Also,
[agreeably with the explanation of the inf. n. in
the first sentence of this art.,] and ↓ عقّلهُ, and
↓ تعقّلهُ, (TA, [see also the first paragraph of art.
عجس,]) and ↓ اعتقلهُ, (Msb, TA,) He withheld
him, or restrained him, (Msb, TA,) عَنْ حَاجَتِهِ
from the object of his want. (TA.) ―
-b7-  And
[hence,] عَقَلَ الدَّوَآءُ بَطْنَهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.
عَقِلَ
(S, K) and
عَقُلَ, (K,) inf. n. عَقْلٌ, (TA,) The medicine bound, or confined, his belly [or bowels]; syn.
أَمْسَكَهُ: (S, O, Msb, K:) accord. to some, particularly after looseness: and بَطْنَهُ ↓ اعتقل signifies the same. (TA.) And يَعْقِلُ الطَّبْعَ is said
of a medicine [as meaning, in like manner, It
binds the bowels; is astringent]. (TA in art.
حمض; &c.) And عقل البَطْنُ [app. عُقِلَ] The
belly [or bowels] became bound, or confined; syn.
اِسْتَمْسَكَ. (TA.) ―
-b8-  عَقَلَ عَلَى القَوْمِ, [aor.
عَقِلَ,]
inf. n. عِقَالٌ, means He collected, or exacted, the
poor-rates of the people, or party; [app. from
عَقَلَ البَعِيرَ; as though he bound with the rope
called عِقَال the camels that he collected;] on the
authority of IKtt. (TA.) 'Omar, when he had
deferred [collecting] the poor-rate in the year [of
drought called] عَامُ الرَّمَادَةِ, sent Ibn-AbeeDhubáb, and said, اِعْقِلْ عَلَيْهِمْ عِقَالَيْنِ فَاقْسِمْ فِيهِمْ
عِقَالًا وَاءْتِنِى بِالآخَرِ [Collect thou from them two
years' poor-rate; then divide among them one
year's poor-rate, and bring to me the other]. (O.)
One says of the collector of the poor-rate, يَعْقِلُ
الصَّدَقَةَ [He collects, or exacts, the poor-rate].
(S, O.) ―
-b9-  عَقَلَ فُلَانًا and ↓ اعتقلهُ signify He
threw down such a one [in wrestling] by twisting
his leg upon the latter's leg: (K, * TA:) [or] you
say, الشَّغْزَبِيَّةَ ↓ صَارَعَهُ فَاعْتَقَلَهُ He wrestled with
him and twisted his leg upon the leg of the latter:
(S, O:) and one says of a wrestler, ↓ لِفُلَانٍ عُقْلَةٌ
بِهَا النَّاسَ ↓ يَعْتَقِلُ, (S, O,) or يَعْقِلُ بِهَا النَّاسَ, i. e.
[Such a one has] a [mode of] twisting his leg with
another's [whereby he wrestles with men]. (TA.)
―
-b10-  عَقَلَتْ شَعَرَهَا, (inf. n. عَقْلٌ, TA,) said of a
woman, She combed her hair: (S, O:) or combed
it in a certain manner; as also ↓ عَقَّلَتْهُ. (TA.)
-A2-  عَقَلَ, aor.
عَقِلَ, inf. n. عَقْلٌ and ↓ مَعْقُولٌ, (S, O,
K,) or the latter, accord. to Sb, is an epithet, [or
a pass. part. n.,] for he used to say that no inf. n.
has the measure مَفْعُولٌ, (S, O,) He was, or became, عَاقِل [i. e. intelligent, &c.; and so ↓ تعقّل;
as though he were withheld, or restrained, from
doing that which is not suitable, or befitting:
see عَقْلٌ below]: and ↓ عقّل, (K, TA,) inf. n.
تَعْقِيلٌ, (TA,) signifies the same, (K,) or [he possessed much intelligence, for] it is with teshdeed to
denote muchness: (TA:) and عَقِلَ, aor.
عَقَلَ, is a
dial. var. of عَقَلَ, aor.
عَقِلَ, signifying he became عَاقِل.
(IKtt, TA.) ―
-b2-  And عَقَلَ الشَّىْءَ, (Msb, K, TA,)
aor.
عَقِلَ, inf. n. عَقْلٌ, (Msb, TA,) He understood,
or knew, the thing; syn. فَهِمَهُ: (K, TA:) or i. q.
تَدَبَّرَهُ [app. as meaning he looked into, considered,
examined, or studied, the thing repeatedly, until he
knew it]; and عَقِلَ, aor.
عَقَلَ, is a dial. var. thereof.
(Msb.) See also 5. ―
-b3-  مَا أَعْقِلُهُ عَنْكَ شَيْئًا, (S, and
so in the K accord. to my copy of the TA, but in
the CK and in my MS. copy of the K ↓ اَعْقَلَهُ,)
meaning دَعْ عَنْكَ الشَّكَّ [Dismiss from thee doubt],
is [said to be] mentioned by Sb; as though the
speaker said, مَا أَعْلِمُ شَيْئًا مِمَّا تَقُولُ فَدَعْ عَنْكَ الشَّكَّ
[I know not aught of what thou sayest, so dismiss
from thee doubt]; and [to be] like the phrases خُذْ
عَنْكَ and سِرْ عَنْكَ: Bekr El-Mázinee says, “I
asked AZ and As and Aboo-Málik and Akh
respecting this phrase, and they all said, 'We
know not what it is: ' ” (so in the S:) [but] it is
a mistake, for مَا أَغْفَلَهُ; (K, TA;) and thus it is
mentioned by Sb and others, with غ and ف.
(TA.) نَخْلَةٌ لَا تَعْقِلُ الإِبَارَ (tropical:)  A palm-tree that
will not receive fecundation is a tropical phrase
[perhaps from عَقَلَ meaning “ he understood ” a
thing]. (A, TA.) ―

O, K) means The woman is on a par with the
man to the third part of her bloodwit; (S, Mgh,
O;) she receives like as the man receives [up to
that point]: (Mgh:) i. e., [for instance,] his
مُوضِحَة [or wound of the head for which the
mulct is five camels] and her مُوضِحَة are equal;
(K;) but when the portion reaches to the third
of the bloodwit, her [portion of the] bloodwit is
the half of that of the man: (S, O, K:) thus, for
one of her fingers, ten camels are due to her, as
in the case of the finger of the man; for two of
her fingers, twenty camels; and for three of her
fingers, thirty; but for four of her fingers, only
twenty, because they exceed the third, therefore
the portion is reduced to the half of what is due
to the man: so accord. to Ibn-El-Museiyab: but
Esh-Sháfi'ee and the people of El-Koofeh assign
for the finger of the woman five camels, and for
two of her fingers ten; and regard not the third
part. (TA.)
-A2-  ↓ عَاقَلْتُهُ فَعَقَلْتُهُ, (S, O, K, *) inf. n.

in philosophical works as meaning He conceived
it in his mind, abstractedly, and otherwise; and
so, sometimes, ↓ عَقَلَهُ, aor.

تعاقلوا دَمُ فُلَانٍ They paid among themselves,
or conjointly, the mulct for the blood of such a one.
(K.) It is said in a trad., إِنَّا لَا نَتَعَاقَلُ المَصْعَ
Verily we will not pay among ourselves, or conjointly, the mulcts for slight wounds of the head,
[lit. the stroke with a sword,] but will oblige him
who commits the offence to pay the mulct for it:
i. e. the people of the towns or villages shall not
pay the mulcts for the people of the desert; nor
the people of the desert, for the people of the
towns or villages; in the like of the case of the
[wound termed] مُوضِحَة. (TA.) And in another

shall take and give among themselves, or conjointly,
their former bloodwits]: i. e. they shall be as they
were in respect of the taking and giving of bloodwits. (TA.) And one says, القَوْمُ عَلَى مَا كَانُوا

milk her, (S, O,) or and so milked her. (K.)
And اعتقل رُمْحَهُ He put his spear between his
shank and his stirrup [or stirrup-leather]: (S, O,
K:) or he (a man riding) put his spear beneath
his thigh, and dragged the end of it upon the

الرَّحْلَ, and ↓ تعقّلهُ; (O;) or اعتقل الرِّجْلَ, (O,
K,) accord. to one relation of a verse of Dhu-rRummeh, (O,) and ↓ تعقّلها; (K;) He [a man
riding upon a camel] folded his leg, and put it
upon the مَوْرِك: (O, K, * TA:) in the K, الوَرِك is
erroneously put for المَوْرِك: (TA:) the مَوْرِك is
before the وَاسِطَة [or upright piece of wood in the
fore part] of the camel's saddle: (AO, in TA
art. ورك:) and one says also, اعتقل قَادِمَةَ رَحْلِهِ
and ↓ تعقّلها; both meaning the same [as above]:
(TA:) and السَّرْجَ ↓ تعقّل and اعتقلهُ He folded
his leg upon the fore part of the سرج [or saddle of
the horse or the like]. (Mgh.) ―

or leather], when sewing a skin, beneath a سَيْر, in
order that it may become strong, and that the
water may not issue from it. (AA, O.)
-A2-  And
one says, اعتقل مِنْ دَمِ فُلَانٍ, (O, K,) and مِنْ
طَائِلَتِهِ, (O,) meaning He took, or received, the
عَقْل, (O, K, TA,) i. e. the mulct for the blood of
such a one. (TA.)
10
إِسْتَعْقَلَ [استعقلهُ He counted, accounted, or esteemed, him عَاقِل, i. e. intelligent, &c.: for] you
say of a man, يُسْتَعْقَلُ [from العَقْلُ], like as you
say يُسْتَحْمَقُ [from الحُمْقُ], and يُسْتَرْأَى from

called for a reason mentioned in the first paragraph in the explanation of the phrase عَقَلْتُ
القَتِيلَ; (As, S, Mgh, * O, Msb;) as also ↓ مَعْقُلَةٌ,
(S, Mgh, O, K,) of which ↓ مِعْقَلَةٌ, with fet-h to
the ق, is a dial. var., mentioned in the R; (TA;)
and of which the pl. is مَعَاقِلُ: (S, O, K:) one
says, ↓ لَنَاعِنْدَ فُلَانٍ ضَمَدٌ مِنْ مَعْقُلَةٍ i. e. We have
a remainder of a bloodwit owed to us by such a
one. (S, O.) And الأُولَى ↓ هُمْ عَلَى مَعَاقِلِهِمِ They
are [acting] in conformity with [the usages relating to] the bloodwits that were in the Time of
Ignorance; (K, TA;) or meaning عَلَى مَا كَانُوا
يَتَعَاقَلُونَ عَلَيْهِ [expl. above (see 6)]: (S, O:) or
they are [acting] in conformity with the conditions of their fathers; (K, TA;) but the former
is the primary meaning: (TA:) and [hence]
عَلَى قَوْمِهِ ↓ صَارَ دَمُ فُلَانٍ مَعْقُلَةً The blood of such
a one became [the occasion of] a debt incumbent
on his people, or party, (S, O, K, *) to be paid by
them from their possessions. (S, O.)
-A2-  And as
being originally the inf. n. of عَقَلَ in the phrase
عَقَلَ الشَّىْءَ meaning [فَهِمَهُ or] تَدَبَّرَهُ; (Msb;) or
as originally meaning المَنْعُ, because it withholds,
or restrains, its possessor from doing that which
is not suitable; or from المَعْقِلُ as meaning “ the
place to which one has recourse for protection
&c.,” because its possessor has recourse to it; (TA;)
العَقْلُ signifies also Intelligence, understanding,

الحُمْقُ; (M, TA;) or the knowledge of the
qualities of things, of their goodness and their badness, and their perfectness and their defectiveness;
or the knowledge of the better of two good things,
and of the worse of two bad things, or of affairs
absolutely; or a faculty whereby is the discrimination between the bad and the good; (K, TA;) but
these and other explanations of العَقْل in the K
are all in treatises of intellectual things, and not
mentioned by the leading lexicologists; (TA;
[in which are added several more explanations of
a similar kind that have no proper place in this
work;]) some say that it is an innate property
by which man is prepared to understand speech;
(Msb;) the truth is, that it is a spiritual light,
(K, TA,) shed into the heart and the brain, (TA,)
whereby the soul acquires the instinctive and speculative kinds of knowledge, and the commencement
of its existence is on the occasion of the young's
becoming in the fætal state, [or rather of its quickening,] after which it continues to increase until
it becomes complete on the attainment of puberty,
(K, TA,) or until the attainment of forty years:
(TA:) the pl. is عُقُولٌ: (K:) Sb mentions عَقْلٌ
as an instance of an inf. n. having a pl., namely,
عُقُولٌ; like شُغْلٌ and مَرَضٌ: (TA in art. مرض:)
IAar says, (O,) العَقْلُ is [syn. with] القَلْبُ, and
القَلْبُ is [syn. with] العَقْلُ: (O, K:) and ↓ المَعْقُولُ
is [said to be] a subst., or name, for العَقْلُ, like
المَجْلُودُ and المَيْسُورُ for الجَلَادَةُ and اليُسْرُ: (Har
p. 12:) it is said in a prov., ↓ مَا لَهُ جُولٌ وَلَا مَعْقُولٌ,
(Meyd, and Har ubi suprà,) meaning He has not
strong purpose of mind, [to withhold, or protect,
him,] like the جول [or casing] of the well of the
collapsing whereof one is free from fear because
of its firmness, nor intellect, or intelligence, (عَقْل,)
to withhold him from doing that which is not
suitable to the likes of him. (Meyd. [But see
مَعْقُولٌ below.]) [Hence, أَسْنَانُ العَقْلِ (see 1 in
art. حنك) and أَضْرَاسُ العَقْلِ (see ضِرْسٌ), both
meaning The wisdom-teeth.]
-A3-  [It is said that]
عَقْلٌ also signifies A fortress; syn. حِصْنٌ. (K.)
[But this seems to be doubtful.] See مَعْقِلٌ.
-A4-

q. v.] or a sort of figured cloth, (K,) or, as in the
M, of red figured cloth: (TA:) or such as is
figured with long forms. (Har p. 416.)
عُقْلَةٌ A bond like the عِقَال [q. v.]: or a shackle.
(Har p. 199.) ―
-b2-  [Hence it seems to signify An
impediment of any kind.] One says, بِهِ عُقْلَةٌ مِنَ
السِّحْرِ وَقَدْ عُمِلَتْ لَهُ نُشْرَةٌ [app. meaning In him is
an impediment arising from enchantment, and a

سعو and سعى.] One says, عَلَى بَنِى فُلَانٍ عِقَالَانِ
On the sons of such a one lies a poor-rate of two

refused me a year's poor-rate: (Mgh, O:) and it
is said that the phrase أَخَذَ عِقَالًا was used when
the collector of the poor-rate took the camels
themselves, not their price: (TA:) or Aboo-Bekr meant a rope of the kind above mentioned;
(Mgh, O, Msb;) for when one gave the poor-rate
of his camels, he gave with them their عُقُل: (O,
Msb:) or (Mgh, TA) he meant thereby a paltry
thing, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) of the value of the [rope
called] عقال: (TA:) or he said عَنَاقًا [“ a she-kid ”]; (Mgh, TA;) so accord. to Bkh, (Mgh,)

things: (Az, TA:) or the most excellent of every
kind of thing: (S, O, K:) and the chief of a
people: (K:) the first is the primary signification: then it became used as meaning the excel-lent of any kind of things, substantial, and also
ideal, as speech, or language: pl. عَقَائِلُ. (TA.)
And العَقِيلَةُ: (K,) or عَقِيلَةُ البَحْرِ, (S, O, TA,)

league together to defend one another, (S, O, K,
TA,) consisting of the relations on the father's
side, (S, Mgh, * O, TA,) who pay the bloodwit
(S, Mgh, O, TA) [app. in conjunction with the
slayer] for him who has been slain unintentionally:
(S, O, TA:) it was decided by the Prophet that
it was to be paid in three years, to the heirs of
the person slain: (TA:) they look to the offender's
brothers on the father's side, who, if they take it
upon them, pay it in three years: if they do not
take it upon them, the debt is transferred to the
sons [meaning all the male descendants] of his
grandfather; and in default of their doing so, to
those of his father's grandfather; and in default
of their doing so, to those of his grandfather's
grandfather; and so on: it is not transferred
from any one of these classes unless they are
unable [to pay it]: and such as are enrolled in a
register [of soldiers or pensioners or any corporation] are alike in respect of the bloodwit: (IAth,
TA:) or, accord. to the people of El-'Irák, it
means the persons enrolled in the registers [of soldiers or of others]: (S, O:) or it is applied to the
persons of the register which was that of the
slayer; who derive their subsistence-money, or
allowances, from the revenues of a particular
register: (Mgh:) Ahmad Ibn-Hambal is related
to have said to Is-hák Ibn-Mansoor, it is applied
to the tribe (قَبِيلَة) [of the slayer]; but that they
bear responsibility [only] in proportion to their
ability; and that if there is no عَاقِلَة, it [i. e. the
bloodwit] is not to be from the property of the
offender; but Is-hák says that in this case it is
to be from the treasury of the state, the bloodwit
not being [in any case] made a thing of no
account: (TA:) the pl. of عَاقِلَةٌ thus applied is
عَوَاقِلُ. (Msb.)

latter has an intensive signification [i. e. having
much intelligence &c.]: (TA: [see an ex. in a
saying cited voce أَبْلَهُ, in art. بله:]) the former
is expl. by some as applied to a man who
withholds, or restrains, and turns back, his
soul from its inclinations, or blamable inclinations: (TA:) and it is likewise applied to a
woman, as also عَاقِلَةٌ: (Msb:) the pl. masc. is
عُقَّالٌ and عُقَلَآءُ, (Msb, K,) this latter pl. sometimes used; and the pl. fem. is عَوَاقِلُ and عَاقِلَاتٌ.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  عَاقِلٌ is also applied to a mountaingoat, as an epithet, signifying That protects himself in his mountain from the hunter: (TA:) [and

(K;) because it renders itself inaccessible in a
high mountain. (S, O, K. *) ―

Linn.; common in Egypt, and there called by
this name; fully described by Forskål in his
Flora Aegypt. Arab., p. 136;] it has thorns;
camels pasture upon it; and [hence] it is called
شَوْكُ الجِمَالِ; it grows upon the dykes and the
تُرَع [or canals for irrigation]; and has a violetcoloured flower. (TA.) [See also تَرَنْجُبِينٌ;
and see حَاجٌ, in art. حيج.]

syn. مَلْجَأٌ; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ عَقْلٌ,
(S, O, K,) of which the pl. is عُقُولٌ: (S, O:) but

on any authority except that of Lth; and held
العُقُولُ, which is cited as an ex. of its pl., to signify “ the protecting oneself in a mountain: ”
(TA:) and مَعْقِلٌ signifies also a fortress; [like
as عَقْلٌ is said to do;] syn. حِصْنٌ: (Mgh:) the
pl. is مَعَاقِلُ. (TA.) Hence one says, using it
metaphorically, هُوَ مَعْقِلُ قَوْمِهِ (tropical:)  He is the refuge

termed in a trad. مَعَاقِلُ الأَرْضِ, meaning The
fortresses [or refuges] of the land. (TA.) ―

camels; for] مَعَاقِلُ الإِبِلِ means The places in

مُعَقَّلَةٌ is applied to camels (إِبِلٌ) as meaning
Bound with the rope called عِقَال. (O, TA.) And
also to a she-camel bound therewith on the occasion of her being covered: and hence the epithet
مُعَقَّلَاتٌ is applied by a poet, metonymically, to
women, in a similar sense. (TA.)
مَعْقُولٌ [pass. part. n. of عَقَلَ in all its senses as
