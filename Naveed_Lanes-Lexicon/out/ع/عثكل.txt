Q. 2
تَعَثْكَلَ العِذْقُ The عذق [or raceme of a
palm-tree or of dates] had many شَمَارِيخ [or
fruit-stalks, also called عَثَاكِيل, whence the verb].
(S, TA.)
عِثْكَالٌ and ↓ عُثْكُولٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and
↓ عُثْكُولَةٌ (K) i. q. شِمْرَاخٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and
شُمْرُوخٌ, (Msb,) i. e. [A fruit-stalk of the raceme
of a palm-tree; or] a stalk, of a كِبَاسَة, upon
which are the ripening dates: (S, O:) or [so in
some copies of the K and in the TA, but in other
copies of the K “ and,”] i. q. عِذْقٌ [i. e. a raceme
of a palm-tree or of dates]; (K;) [i. e.] an عُنْقُود
of a palm-tree, of which the شِمْرَاخ is a single
branching stalk: (Mgh:) [agreeably with this
last explanation and the latter of the two here
given from the K, it is said,] and it is, in relation
to the palm-tree, like the عُنْقُود in relation to the
grape-vine: (S, O:) and in one dial., the ع is
changed into ء, so that one says إِثْكَالٌ [and
أُثْكُولٌ]: the pl. is عَثَاكِيلُ. (Msb.) It is said in
a trad., خُذُوا عِثْكَالًا فِيهِ مِائَةُ شِمْرَاخٍ فَاضْرِبُوهُ بِهَا
ضَرْبَةً [i. e. Take ye a raceme of a palm-tree in
which are a hundred fruit-stalks, and strike him
therewith a single stroke]. (O.)
عُثْكُولٌ: see the next preceding paragraph: ―
-b2-
and that here following.
عُثْكُولَةٌ: see عِثْكَالٌ. ―
-b2-  Also, (K,) and ↓ عُثْكُولٌ,
(TA,) (assumed tropical:)  A kind of pendant, of عِهْن [i. e. wool,
or dyed wool], or some [other] ornament, (K, TA,)
suspended to a هودج [or women's camel-vehicle],
(TA,) so as to dangle in the air: (K, TA:) pl.
عَثَاكِلُ occurring in a verse [by poetic license for
عَثَاكِيلُ]. (TA.)
عِدْقٌ مُعَثْكَلٌ [A raceme of a palm-tree or of
dates] having many شَمَارِيخ [or fruit-stalks].
(TA.) [See also the following paragraph.] ―
-b2-
And, by way of comparison [thereto], هَوْدَجْ
مُعَثْكَلٌ (assumed tropical:)  A هودج [or women's camel-vehicle]
having much wool [in the form of pendants, suspended to it]. (TA.)
عِذْقٌ مُتَعَثْكِلٌ and مُتَعَثْكَلٌ [A raceme of a palm-
tree or of dates] having عَثَاكِيل [i. e. fruit-stalks].
(K.) [See also the next preceding paragraph.]
