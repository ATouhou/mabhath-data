used in the sense of an inf. n., like as كَاذِبَةٌ is
[said to be] in the Kur lvi. 2, (S, O,) or it is an
inf. n. syn. with عَقْبٌ, (Msb in art. عفو,) Such a
one succeeded, or took the place of, his father; (S,
O, TA;) as also ↓ عقّب. (TA.) [Hence also
several phrases here following.] ―
-b3-  It is said in a
trad., كُلُّ غَازِيَةٍ غَزَتْ يَعْقُبُ بَعْضُهَا بَعْضًا i. e.

with his wife]: (S, O:) or عَقَبَهُ signifies [simply]
بِغَاهُ بِشَرٍّ [he sought to do evil to him]: (K: [in
which وَخَلَفَهُ seems to have been inadvertently
omitted: but SM immediately adds what here
follows:]) and one says also, عَقَبَ فِى إِثْرِ الرَّجُلِ
بِمَا يُكْرَهُ, aor.
عَقُبَ, inf. n. عَقْبٌ, meaning He accused the man [app. behind his back] of a thing

من مالك,]) Whatever evil consequence happen
to me, with respect to it, (referring to merchandise,) the responsibility for it will be on thee [and
compensation shall be made from thy property]:
and [تَعْقِبَةٌ (thus in the O) appears, from what
follows, to be an inf. n. of the latter verb in this
sense; or it may perhaps be from the former
verb, like تَهْلِكَةٌ from هَلَكَ; for] one says, بَاعَنِى
سِلْعَةً وَعَلَيْهِ تَعْقِبَةٌ إِنْ كَانَت فِيهَا [He sold me an
article of merchandise, and was responsible for an
evil consequence, (or for damage afterwards found

After the words in the Kur lx. 11, وَإِنْ فَاتَكُمْ شَىْءٌ
مِنْ أَزْوَاجِكُمْ إِلَى الْكُفَّارِ, there are three different
readings, ↓ فَعَاقَبْتُمْ, and ↓ فَعَقَّبْتُمْ, and فَعَقَبْتُمْ:
(TA:) the first means and ye take, or carry off,
spoil: (Masrook Ibn-El-Ajda', S, TA:) or the
second has this meaning; and the first means
and ye punish them so that ye take, or carry off,
spoil: and the third means and ye have a requital:
the second is the best; and the third is also good;
but the second has a more intensive meaning:
(Aboo-Is-hák the Grammarian, L, TA:) accord.
to Fr, the first and second signify the same: (L,
TA:) and As says that عَقْبٌ [inf. n. of عَقَبَ] is
syn. with عِقَابٌ [inf. n. of عَاقَبَ; but whether
with reference to this case, I do not find]. (TA.)

a خَوْق. i. e. the ring of an ear-drop, fearing lest
it should incline on one side: or he bound an earring with a thread called عُقَاب: (TA:) and he
wound round a bow, (S, O, K,) and an arrow,
(S, O,) with [the kind of sinew, or tendon, called]
عَقَب, (O,) or with somewhat thereof: (S, K:)
or عَقَبَهُ بِالعَقَبِ he bound it, namely, the [arrow

عَقِبٌ,)] We lined the well with stones behind [the
other] stones. (TA. [See also 4.])
-A4-  [The inf. n.]
العَقْبُ also signifies الرَّجْعُ, [which generally
means The making, or causing, to return, or go
back; but this may perhaps be a mistake for
الرُّجُوعُ, for it is immediately added,] Dhu-rRummeh says,
كَأَنَّ صِيَاحَ الكُدْرِ يَنْظُرْنَ عَقْبَنَا
تَرَاطُنُ أَنْبَساطٍ عَلَيْهِ طَغَامِ

thing and then returning to doing it: (IAth, TA:)
the performing an act of prayer, or another act,

every year, to call back one party of the forces
and to send another to take its turn after the
former. (O, TA.) ―
-b3-  Also The performing of
prayer (IAth, O, K, TA) as a supererogatory
act (TA) after the [prayers called] تَرَاوِيح:

not in the mosque. (IAth, TA.) ―
-b4-  And The
waiting (K, TA) in prayer; or remaining in one's
place in prayer waiting for another prayer. (TA.)
And you say, عقّب فِى الصَّلَاةِ, (S, O,) inf. n. as
above, (S, A, O, Msb, K,) He sat after the performing of the [ordinary] prayer for the purpose
of a supplication (S, A, O, Msb, K) or a petition. (S, O, Msb.) وَلَّى مُدْبِرًا وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ, in the
Kur [xxvii. 10 and xxviii. 31], means [He did
did not turn back retreating] and did not wait;
(O, TA;) properly, did not make advancing to
follow his retreating: (O:) or and did not turn
aside (S, Msb) nor wait in expectation: (S:) or
and did not turn aside nor return: (O:) or and
did not look aside: (K, * TA.) or and did not
return; from عقّب said of a combatant, meaning
He returned after fleeing: (Bd in xxvii. 10:)
you say, عقّب عَلَيْهِ He returned against him;
syn. كَرَّ, and رَجَعَ: and تَعْقِيبٌ signifies also The

بِأَخْلَاقٍ حَسَنَةٍ [app. means He had latterly, in the
time of hoariness, good dispositions]. (O. [The
meaning that I have assigned to this phrase
seems to be there indicated by the context: but
I incline to think that the right reading is عُقِّبَ,
(assumed tropical:)  lit. He was made to be followed, in hoariness,
by good dispositions; agreeably with what next
follows.]) ―
-b6-  آتَى فُلَانٌ إِلَىَّ خَيْرًا فَعُقِّبَ بِخَيْرٍ مِنْهُ
[means Such a one caused good to betide me, and
it was made to be followed by what was better
than it]. (A, TA. [In the former it is followed
by the words وَأَرْدِفَ بِخَيْرٍ مِنْهُ, evidently for the
purpose of explanation.]) ―
-b7-  [Hence,] one says,
تَصَدَّقَ بِصَدَقَةٍ لَيْسَ فِيهَا تَعْقِيبٌ, meaning اِسْتِشْنَآءٌ [i. e.

exerting himself. (S, O, L, TA.) In the K,
التَّعْقِيبُ [the inf. n.] is expl. as signifying التَّرَدُّدُ
فِى طَلَبِ المَجْدِ: but the right reading is فِى
طَلَبٍ مُجِدًّا. (TA.) [See also مُعَقِّبٌ.]
-A2-  عقّب
said of the [plant called] عَرْفَج, (S, O,) inf. n.

alternation between the two things; he made the
two things interchangeable, or commutable;] he
brought, or did, the two things interchangeably, or
alternately, i. e. one of them one time and the
other of them another time. (TA.) [Thus, for
instance,] العَرَبُ تُعَاقِبُ بَيْنَ الفَآءِ والثَّآءِ [The Arabs
make an interchange between ف and ث; make
ف and ث interchangeable, or commutable; i. e.
put ف in the place of ث, and ث in the place of
ف]; as in جَدَفٌ and جَدَثٌ; and ↓ تُعْقِبُ signifies the same. (S, O.) ―
-b4-  And عاقب signifies
also He stood upon one of his legs one time and
upon the other another time; or moved his legs

(S, Msb, * TA,) inf. n. عِقَابٌ (S, Msb, TA) and
مُعَاقَبَةٌ, (Msb, TA,) He punished him for his
crime, sin, fault, or offence: (S, * Msb, * TA:)
and [in like manner] ↓ تعقّبهُ He punished him
(i. e. a man, S, O) for a crime, a sin, a fault, or
an offence, that he had committed. (S, O, K.)
In the saying in the Kur [xvi. last verse but one],
وَإِنْ عَاقَبْتُمْ فَعَاقِبُوا بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبْتُمٌ بِهِ [And if ye
punish, then punish ye with the like of that with
which ye have been afflicted, lit. punished], the
verb first denotes punishment, and is afterwards
used for the purpose of assimilation: and similar
to this is the saying in the same [xxii. 59],
وَمَنْ عَاقَبَ بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبَ بِهِ [And whoso punisheth
with the like of that with which he hath been afflicted, lit. punished]. (O.) For another ex.,
from the Kur lx. 11, [where it implies retaliation
or retribution,] see 1, latter half. [In like manner,]
it is said in a trad., أَبْطَلَ النَّفْحَ إِلَّا أَنْ يُضْرَبَ
فَيُعَاقِبَ [He made the kicking of a beast with the
hind leg to be of no account unless it were beaten
by its master, or rider, and retaliated by kicking
another person]; meaning, he made nothing to
be incumbent on the master of the beast unless
the latter made the kicking to be a consequence
of that [i. e. unless the beast kicked in consequence of its being beaten by the master, or
rider]. (TA.) [See also 4, which has a similar
meaning, that of requital.] ―
-b6-  عُوقِبَتْ said of a
mare means She was required to perform run
after run. (Ham p. 277.)

اعقبهُ: see 1, first quarter, in three places:
―
-b2-  and see 3, in three places. ―
-b3-  [Also He made
him to take his place. And hence,] He descended
from his beast in order that he (another) might
ride in his turn: and one says also أَعْقِبْ meaning
Descend thou in order that I may ride in my turn:
and in like manner with respect to any kind of
action: thus, when the office of Khaleefeh became
transferred from the sons of Umeiyeh to the
Háshimees, Sudeyf, the poet of the 'Abbásees,
said,
أَعْقِبِى آلَ هَاشِمٍ يَا مَيَّا
meaning Descend from the station of the Khaleefehs that the family of Háshim may mount, O
Meiyà [for O sons of Umeiyeh]. (TA.) ―
-b4-
[And It made a thing to follow as a consequence
to him: the verb in this sense being doubly
trans.] One says, اعقبهُ نَدَمًا It occasioned him
as its consequence repentance, (Mgh, Msb, TA,)
and هَمًّا anxiety. (TA.) And أَكَلَ أَكْلَةً أَعْقَبَتْهُ
سَقَمًا He ate a repast that occasioned him as its
consequence a sickness. (S, O.) And [hence] أُعْقِبَ
عِزُّهُ ذُلًّا His might was exchanged for, or changed
into, [lit. made to be followed by,] abasement.
(TA.) See also 2, first quarter, for another ex.
[Hence, likewise,] فَأَعْقَبَهُمْ نِفَاقًا, in the Kur
[ix. 78], means [Therefore He caused hypocrisy
to follow as a consequence to them; or] He caused
them to err, because of their evil deed, as a punishment to them. (O.) And [in like manner] one
says, أَعْقَبَهُ اللّٰهُ بِإِحْسَانِهِ خَيْرًا [God gave him, or
may God give him, as a recompense, or requital,
for his beneficence, good, or prosperity]. (TA.)
And اعقبهُ بِطَاعَتِهِ He recompensed, or requited,
him for his obedience, (S, O, K, *) and عَلَى مَا صَنَعَ
for what he did. (TA. [See also 3, which has a
similar meaning, that of retribution.]) اعقبهُ خَيْرًا
means also He gave him in exchange good. (TA.)
See also 1, latter half, where the verb is expl. in
the contr. sense, that of taking, or receiving, in
exchange. ―
-b5-  اعقبهُ الطَّائِفُ The diabolical visitation, or insanity, returned to him at times. (S, O.)
―
-b6-  اعقب طَىَّ البِئْرِ بِحِجَارَةٍ مِنْ وَرَائِهَا [is app. from

compactly together at the back [behind the regular
casing] of the well. (TA. [See also 1, near the
end.])

مِنْهُمْ رَجُلَانِ وَدَرَجَ وَاحِدٌ [Two men of them died
and left offspring, and one died and left no offspring]: and Tufeyl El-Ghanawee says,
كَرِيمَةُ حُرِّ الوَجْهِ لَمْ تَدْعُ هَالِكًا
↓ مِنَ القَوْمِ هُلْكًا فِى غَدٍ غَيْرَ مُعْقِبِ
[A female noble of countenance, (or whose nobility
was manifest in what appeared of her countenance,)
she did not invoke one of the people dead, on a
morrow after an engagement, as having perished
without leaving a successor, or one to fill his place:]
i. e. when a chief of her people died, another
chief came; so that she did not bewail a chief
who had not his equal. (TA.) ―
-b2-  He (a borrower of a cooking-pot) returned a cooking-pot
with the remains termed عُقْبَة in it. (S, O, K.) ―
-b3-

أَمْرِهِ He repented of his affair. (TA.) ―
-b3-  تعقّب
عَنِ الخَبَرِ He doubted of the information, or questioned it, and asked again respecting it. (S, O, K,
TA. [In my copies of the S, and in the O, الخَيْرِ:
but see what follows; in which مُتَعَقَّب is used as
a noun of place of the verb in this sense.]) Tufeyl
says,
↓ وَلَمْ يَكُ عَمَّا خَبَّرُوا مُتَعَقَّبُ
[And there was no place of, or ground for, doubting, and asking again, respecting what they told].
(S, O, TA.) And one says, لَمْ أَجِدْ عَنْ قَوْلِكَ
↓ مُتَعَقَّبًا, (A, TA,) i. e. [I found not] any place
of, or ground for, inquiring into, or investigating,
thy saying; syn. مُتَفَحَّصًا; (A, TA;) [or questioning it; or returning to examine it;] meaning,
thy saying was right and true, so that it did not
require التَّعَقُّب; (A;) or I did not allow myself
to doubt, and ask again, respecting it, that I
might see whether I should do what thou saidst
or abstain from it. (TA.) ―
-b4-  [And the verb is
used transitively in a similar sense.] You say,
تعقّب الخَبَرَ He searched after the information
repeatedly, or time after time; (Mgh, * TA;)
syn. تَتَبَّعَ: (Mgh, TA:) and ↓ اعتقب has a like
meaning. (Ham p. 287.) And He asked respecting the information another person than the one
whom he asked the first time. (A, TA.) ―
-b5-  And
تَعَقَّبْتُ الرَّجُلَ I sought to discover in the man that
which he would be ashamed to expose; or the slip,
or fault, that he had committed: and ↓ اِسْتَعْقَبْتُهُ
signifies the same. (O, K. *) [In critical observations and the like, تعقّبهُ is often used as meaning He found fault with him; animadverted upon
him; or impugned his judgment or assertion;
بِقَوْلِهِ كَذَا وَكَذَا by his saying so and so. And
تعقّب عَلَيْهِ seems to be similarly used as meaning
He animadverted upon his saying: (compare
اِعْتَرَضَ عَلَيْهِ:) but more commonly as meaning
he animadverted upon it, i. e. a saying, and the
like.] ―
-b6-  See also 3, near the middle of the para-
graph. ―
-b7-  تعقّب الأَمْرَ He thought repeatedly upon

may be rendered, nearly in accordance with an
explanation by Et-Tebreezee, And if a speech

يَتَعَاقَبَانِ (T, S, O, Msb, TA) They follow
each other [by turns]; or alternate; (T, Msb,
TA;) one coming and the other going; (TA;)
said of the night and the day; (T, Msb;) or as
the night and the day; (S, O, TA;) as also
↓ يَعْتَقِبَانِ. (TA.) You say, تَعَاقَبَ المُسَافِرَانِ
عَلَى الدَّابَّةِ The two travellers rode upon the beast,
each of them in his turn. (TA: and the like is
said in the Msb.) And تعاقبا عَمَلًا They two did
a work, or deed, by turns, or alternately: syn.
اِرْتَوَحَاهُ, (K and TA in art. روح,) and تَرَاوَحَاهُ
(TA in that art.) And تعاقبا They helped each
other by turns. (TA.) And بِالضَّرْبِ ↓ يَعْتَقبَانِهِ
They two ply him by turns with beating (A.) See
also 3, near the beginning. التَّعَاقُبُ also signifies
The coming to water [by turns, or] time after time.
(TA.)

إِعْتَقَبَ see 1, former half, in two places: ―
-b2-  and
see 3, near the beginning, in two places; and 6,
also in two places. ―
-b3-  [اعتقبهُ signifies also He
took it, or had it, subsequently. Thus one of the
meanings of العُقْبَةُ is expl. in the A and TA by
the words مَا يَعْتَقِبُونَهُ بَعْدَ الطَّعَامِ مِنَ الحَلَاوَةِ i. e.
What they have, or take, after the main portion
of the meal, consisting of sweetmeat. ―
-b4-  And He
had it, or experienced it, as a consequence of an
act &c.: and that it may have ↓ مُعْتَقَبُ for an
inf. n. in this sense (as well as in other senses
agreeably with analogy) seems to be meant by
its being said (in the Ham p. 287) that المُعْتَقَبُ
signifies أَخْذُ عُقْبَةِ الشَّىْءِ i. e. آخِرِهِ. See also a
somewhat similar signification of 5.] One says,
فَعَلْتُ كَذَا فَاعْتَقَبْتُ مِنْهُ نَدَامَةً i. e. [I did such a
thing and] I found, or experienced, in consequence
thereof repentance; (S, O;) as also ↓ اِسْتَعْقَبْتُ.
(A, O.) And مِنْ كَذَا خَيْرًا ↓ استعقب He found,
or experienced, in consequence of such a thing, or
after such a thing, good. (T, Msb.) And hence,
perhaps, the saying of the lawyers, يَصِحُّ الشِّرَآءُ
عِتْقًا ↓ إِذَا اسْتَعْقَبَ [as meaning The sale, or purchase, is valid when it has emancipation as an
after-event]: but this does not agree with the
former phrase unless by a far-fetched interpretation; and therefore one should say, إِذَا عَقَبَهُ العِتْقُ
i. e. when emancipation follows it. (Msb.) ―
-b5-
اعتقب also signifies He withheld, or detained, a
thing in his possession. (TA.) And [particularly]
He (a seller) withheld, or detained, an article of
merchandise from the purchaser until he should
receive the price: (S, A, O, K:) for the doing
of which he is said in a trad. to be responsible;
meaning, if it perish in his keeping. (S, A, O.)
And He detained, confined, or imprisoned, a man.

إِسْتَعْقَبَ see the next preceding paragraph, in three
places: ―
-b2-  and see also 1, latter half: ―
-b3-  and 5.
―
-b4-  [Accord. to Reiske, as mentioned by Freytag,
استعقبهُ signifies also He followed his footsteps.]
عَقْبٌ: see عَقِبٌ, in eight places.
عُقْبٌ: see عَقِبٌ, in seven places.
عَقَبٌ The عَصَب [meaning sinews, or tendons,]
of which أَوْتَار [i. e. strings for bows or the like]
are made: (S, O, K: [see also 1, last quarter:])
n. un. with 3: (S, O:) or such as are white of the
أَطْنَاب of the joints; (Mgh, Msb; [see عَصَبٌ;])
the عَصَب being such as are yellow: (Mgh and
Msb in art. عصب:) accord. to IAth, the عَصَب
[or sinews, or tendons,] of the two portions of
flesh next the back-bone on either side, and of the
سَاقَانِ and وَظِيفَانِ [meaning the hind and fore
shanks], that are intermingled with the flesh, of
any animal; the half of one whereof, divided
lengthwise from the other half, is extended, or
drown out, and trimmed, and cleansed of the
flesh, and the وَتَر [or string for the bow or the
like] is made thereof; and they are sometimes in
the two sides of the camel; but [properly speaking]
there is a difference between the عَصَب and the
عقَب; the former being such as incline to yellow,
whereas the latter incline to white, and are the
harder, and firmer, or stronger, of the two:
AHn says, on the authority of Aboo-Ziyád, that
the عَقَب are [the sinews, or tendons,] of the two
portions of flesh next the back-bone on either side,
of the sheep or goat, and of the camel, and of the
ox or cow,(TA.) [See also عِلْبَآءٌ.]
عَقِبٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, &c.) and ↓ عَقْبٌ,
(Msb, TA,) the latter being a contraction of the
former, (Msb,) [The heel of a human being;] the
hinder part of the foot of a human being: (S,
Mgh, O, Msb, K:) of the fem. gender: (S, O,
Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَعْقُبٌ (TA) and [of mult.
as well as of pauc.] أَعْقَابٌ: (Msb, TA:) and
↓ عَقِيبٌ is said to signify the same; but MF
cites an assertion that this is a word of a bad
dialect. (TA.) وَيْلٌ لِلْأَعْقَابِ مِنَ النَّارِ [Wo to
the heels from the fire of Hell], (O, Msb, TA,)
and ويل لِلْعَقِبِ من النّار [Who to the heel &c.],
(TA,) occurring in a trad., means wo to him who
neglects the washing of the heels in the ablution
preparatory to prayer. (O, * Msb, TA. *) عَقِبُ
الشَّيْطَانِ, (O, Msb, TA,) or, as some say, ↓ عُقْبَةُ
الشيطان, (Msb, TA,) with damm, (TA,) which
is forbidden in prayer, is expl. as meaning The
placing the buttocks upon the heels between the two
prostrations; which is what some term الإِقْعَآءُ:
(Mgh, * O, Msb, TA:) so says A'Obeyd: (Msb:)
or, accord. to some, this means the leaving the
heels unwashed in the ablution preparatory to
prayer. (O.) وَطِئَ النَّاسُ عَقِبَ فُلَانٍ [lit. The
people trod upon the heel of such a one] means
the people walked after, or near after, such a
one: and in like manner, هُوَ مُوَطَّأُ العَقِبِ [lit. He
is one whose heel is trodden upon]: (O, TA; *)
because of his having command over people, and
their being submissive to him: (O:) the latter
phrase means he is one who has many followers:
(A, TA: [see also art. وطأ:]) جَآءَ زَيْدٌ يَطَأُ عَقِبَ
عَمْرٍو primarily signifies Zeyd came putting his
foot in the place of the foot [or heel] of 'Amr
every time that the latter raised his foot. (Msb.)
And one says, مِنْ أَيْنَ عَقِبُكَ, (A, O,) or مِنْ أَيْنَ
كَانَ عَقِبُكَ, (TA,) meaning Whence camest thou?
or Whence hast thou come? (A, O, TA.) And
رَجَعَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى عَقِبِهِ Such a one returned by the
way of his heel; i. e., by the way that was behind
him, and whence he had come; quickly. (Msb.)
And وَلَّى عَلَى عَقِبِهِ, and عَلَى عَقِبَيْهِ, He turned
back, or receded, from a thing to which he had
betaken himself. (TA.) لَا تَرُدَّهُمْ عَلَى أَعْقَابِهِمْ,
occurring in a trad., means Turn not thou them
back to their former condition of not emigrating
[for the sake of religion]: and مَا زَالُوا مُرْتَدِّينَ
عَلَى أَعْقَابِهِمْ, in another trad., means They ceased
not to return to infidelity: as though they went
back wards. (TA.) ―
-b2-  The عَقِب of the نَعْل [or
sandal] is The part [or wide strap] that embraces
the heel. (AO, in an anom. MS. in my possession.) ―
-b3-  [And عَقِبُ البَابِ means The pivot
(generally of wood) at the bottom of the door,
turning in a socket in the threshold.] ―
-b4-  And
عَقِبٌ and ↓ عَقْبٌ (TA) and ↓ عُقُبٌ and ↓ عُقْبٌ
(S, O, Msb, K, TA) and ↓ عُقْبَى and ↓ عُقْبَةٌ and
↓ عُقْبَانٌ and ↓ عِقْبَانٌ and ↓ عَاقِبٌ (TA) are syn.
with ↓ عَاقِبَةٌ, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) which signifies,
(S, O, Msb, K,) i. e. as signifying, (TA,) The
end; or the last, or latter, part or state; [but
generally as explanatory of this last word, and
often as explanatory of عُقُبٌ and عُقْبٌ and عُقْبَى,
as meaning the consequence, or result, or issue;]
of anything: (S, O, Msb, K, TA:) [and the same
words, app. with the exception of عُقْبَى and عَاقِبَةٌ,
signify also a time, or state, of subsequence:] the
pl. [of the first four words is أَعْقَابٌ, and] of the
last عَوَاقِبُ. (TA.) Hence, (S,) it is said in the
Kur [xviii. 42], ↓ هُوَ خَيْرٌ ثَوَابًا وَخَيْرٌ عُقُبًا [or ↓ عُقْبًا
or ↓ عُقْبَى, accord. to different readings, i. e. He
is the best in respect of recompense, or reward,
and the best in respect of consequence, or result,
or issue; i. e., the consequence of the actions &c.
of believers]. (S, O.) And in the same [xci. last
verse], ↓ وَلَا يَخَافُ عُقْبَاهَا i. e. And He feareth not
the consequence thereof. (Th, TA.) And they
said, لَكَ فِى الخَيْرِ ↓ العُقْبَى meaning العَاقِبَةُ [i. e.
May the end to thee be in that which is good; or
may thy case end in good]. (TA.) And it is
said in a trad., سَافَرَ فِى عَقِبِ رَمَضَانَ, (T, O, Msb,)
meaning He journeyed in the end, or the last, or
latter, part, of Ramadán: (T, Msb:) or, when
Ramadán had almost ended. (O.) One says,
جِئْتُ فِى عَقِبِ رَمَضَانَ, (ISk, S, O, * Msb, *) with
kesr to the ق, (ISk, S,) meaning [I came] when
there was somewhat remaining of Ramadán.
(ISk, S, O, * Msb.) And جِئْتُكَ فِى عَقِبِ الشَّهْرِ,
and ↓ فى عَقْبِهِ, and عَلَى عَقِبِهِ, I came to thee in
the latter part of the month, when ten days of it,
or less, remained. (L.) هُوَ فِى عَقِبِ المَرَضِ He
is in the state of convalescence in which somewhat
remains of the disease: (Msb:) and فِى أَعْقَابِ
المَرَضِ in the [state in which there are some] remains of the disease. (TA.) One says also, جَآءَ
فِى عَقِبِهِ and ↓ عَقْبِهِ, meaning He came after him;
or near after him; [as though at his heel; and
hence, properly, close after him;] and جَآءَ عَقِبَهُ;
from the phrase جَآءَ زَيْدٌ يَطَأُ عَقِبَ عَمْرٍو, meaning
as expl. above. (Msb.) And بَنُو فُلَانٍ سَقْىُ إِبِلِهِمْ
عَقِبَ بَنِى فُلَانٍ i. e. [The sons of such a one, the
watering of their camels is] after [that of] the
sons of such a one; a saying mentioned by ISk.
(Msb.) And صَلَّيْنَا أَعْقَابَ الفَرِيضَةِ تَطَوُّعًا i. e.
[We performed prayer] after the obligatory [by
way of supererogation]. (Lh, IF, Msb, TA.)
And جِئْتُ فِى عَقِبِ الشَّهْرِ i. e. I came after the
month had passed. (El-Fárábee, Msb.) And خَلَفَ
فُلَانٌ بعَقِبِى Such a one remained, or stayed, after
me. (Msb.) Er-Rázee says, in the Mukhtár es-
Siháh, that he had found no authority in the T
nor in the S for the phrase جَآءَ فُلَانٌ عقبَ فُلَانٍ
[app. عَقِبَ], meaning Such a one came after such
a one, except a similar saying of ISk, cited by
Az, in which عقبَ is expl. as signifying after.
(TA.) [But if the word in question be عَقِبَ,
sufficient authorities for its use in this sense have
been cited above: though it seems from what
here follows that عُقُبَ or عُقْبَ in this sense is
preferable.] One says, شَهْرِ ↓ جِئْتُ فِى عُقْبِ
رَمَضَانَ, (S,) or ↓ عُقُبِهِ, (O,) and ↓ عَلَى عُقْبِهِ and
↓ عُقُبِهِ, (L,) and ↓ فِى عُقْبَانِهِ, (S, O,) meaning I
came when the whole of the month of Rama-
dán had passed: (S, O, L:) and ↓ جِئْتُكَ عُقْبَ
رَمَضَانَ I came to thee at the end of Ramadán:
and مَمَرِّهِ ↓ جِئْتُ فُلَانًا عَلَى عُقْبِ and ↓ عُقُبِهِ and
عَقِبِهِ and ↓ عُقْبَانِهِ I came to such a one after he
had gone: and ذَاكَ ↓ أَتَيْتُكَ عَلَى عُقُبِ and عَقِبَ
ذاك and ذاك ↓ عَقْبِ and ذاك ↓ عُقْبَانِ I came to
thee after that: and قُدُومِهِ ↓ جِئْتُهُ عُقْبَ I came
to him after his arrival. (Lh, TA.) One says
also, آلِ فُلَانٍ ↓ فُلَانٌ يَسْتَقِى عَلَى عُقْبَةِ Such a one
draws water after the family of such a one. (TA.)
And MF mentions ↓ جِئْتُكَ عَلَى عَاقِبِهِ [app. meaning I came to thee after him, or it]: and Aboo-Mis-hal mentions [app. in this sense] ↓ عِقْبَانِهِ,
with kesr. (TA.) ―
-b5-  عَقِبٌ (S, A, Mgh, O, Msb,
K) and ↓ عَقْبٌ (S, O, Msb, K) also signify The
child, or children, (S, A, O, Msb, K,) of a man;
(S, O;) as also ↓ عَاقِبَةٌ: (S, O, K:) and the
child, or children, of the child or children, (S, A,
O, Msb, K,) of a man: (S, O:) applied to such
as remain after the father: (TA:) or a man's
offspring; (Mgh;) and so ↓ عَاقِبَةٌ: (Msb:) or
his male children: and, accord. to some of the
lawyers, the children of the daughters [of a man,
also]: (Mgh:) of the fem. gender, on the authority of Akh: (S, O:) pl. أَعْقَابٌ. (TA.) The
Arabs say, لَا عَقِبَ لَهُ, meaning There is, or are,
no male offspring remaining to him: (TA:) and
↓ لَيْسَتْ لِفُلَانٍ عَاقِبَةٌ There is, or are, to such a one,
no [remaining] child, or children. (S, O, Msb.)
―
-b6-  شَىْءٍ ↓ عَقْبُ [or عَقِبُ شَىْءٍ] signifies A thing,
whatever it be, that follows, succeeds, comes after,
or takes the place of, a thing; as the water of a
well, and the blowing of the wind, and the flying
of the sand-grouse (القَطَا), and the running of a
horse. (TA. [See also عَاقِبٌ.]) ―
-b7-  And عَقِبٌ,

As says, each of these, some of the Arabs using
the latter form, by way of contraction, (Msb,) A
run after another run, (As, IF, S, Msb, K,) of
a horse: (As, IF, S, Msb:) or the last, or latter,
run, of a horse: (IAar, Msb:) or one says of a
courser, هُوَ ذُوْ عَفْوٍ وَعَقِبٍ meaning He has a first
run, and a subsequent, and more vehement, run:
(A:) and ↓ عِقَابٌ is said in the L to have the first
of these meanings: (TA:) or it is pl. of عَقْبٌ [or
عَقِبٌ] as having that meaning: (Ham p. 358:)
an ex. of it occurs in the following verse, (Ham,
TA,) cited by IAar: (TA:)
يَمْلَأُ عَيْنَيْكَ بِالفِنَآءِ وَيُرْ
ضِيكَ عِقَابًا إِنْ شِئْتَ أَوْ نَزَقَا
[That would satisfy thine eye by his beauty, in the
area before the dwelling, and content thee by run
after run, or by runs after runs, if thou wilt, or
by lightness, or agility]: (Ham, TA:) [or it may
be here an inf. n., (of 3,) meaning on an occasion
of being required to perform run after run: (see
3, last sentence:)] or, accord. to IAar, the meaning in this instance is, by his owner's making, upon
him, warring, or warring and plundering, expeditions time after time: (TA:) accord. to Kh,
لَهُ عِقَابٌ, said of a horse, means he has a recovering of strength (جمام [i. e. جَمَامٌ]) after ceasing
to run. (Ham ubi suprà.) ―
-b8-  Hence, A reply:
so in the saying, relating to him who stops, or

had a reply, assuredly he would have spoken].

as also عَقْمَةٌ: (O, TA:) accord. to Yaakoob, the
ب is a substitute for م. (TA.)
عُقْبَةٌ: see عَقِبٌ, in three places. ―
-b2-  Also The
last that remains: so in the saying, فُلَانٌ عُقْبَةُ
بَنِى فُلَانٍ [Such a one is the last that remains of
the sons of such a one]. (L.) ―
-b3-  And A turn; or
time at which, or during which, anything is, or is
to be, done, or had, in succession: (S, Mgh, O,
Msb, K:) pl. عُقَبٌ. (Msb.) One says, تَمَّتْ
عُقْبَتُكَ Thy turn is completed. (S, O.) And دَارَتْ

دَابَّتِةِ عُقْبَةً فَلَهُ كَذَا Whoso walks a turn to a certain point, instead of his beast, to him shall be
given such a thing. (TA.) عُقْبَةُ الأجِيرِ means
The hired-man's turn to ride; when the hirer
dismounts, for example in the morning, and he
(the former) rides. (Mgh.) And [the pl.] عُقَبٌ
means [particularly] The turns of camels, when
they are being watered: the watering of a number
of camels together after another number is termed
their عُقْبَة. (TA.) [See also عُقْبَى.] ―

is said that] it means also Camels which a man
pastures and waters in his turn; and IAar cites
as an ex.
إِنَّ عَلَىَّ عُقْبَةً أَقْضِيهَا
لَسْتُ بِنَاسِيهَا وَلَا مُنْسِيهَا
[but this I would rather render, Verily I have
incumbent on me a turn to pasture and water
camels; and I perform it; I am not a neglecter
thereof nor a delayer of it]; meaning I drive the
camels which I pasture and water in my turn,
and I tend them well: مُنْسِيهَا is for مُنْسِئِهَا, for
the sake of the rhyme. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Also The place

says, أَخَذْتُ مِنْ أَسِيرِى عُقْبَةً I took, or received,
for my captive, a substitute, or something in exchange. (S, O.) And ↓ سَأُعْطِيكَ مِنْهَا عُقْبَى occurs in a trad., meaning I will give thee something
in exchange [for her, i. e.] for sparing her life,
and liberating her. (L, TA.) ―
-b10-  And Pasture,
or food, of an ostrich, that is eaten after other

men:] pl. as above. (AA, S, O.) One says of
camels, رَعَتْ عُقْبَتَهَا i. e. They pastured upon the
[kind of plants termed] حَمْض after the [kind

cooking-pot, adhering to the bottom. (TA.) And
Somewhat of broth which the borrower of a cooking-pot returns when he returns the pot. (S, O,

of this I know not.]) ―
-b13-  One says also, لَقِيتُ مِنْهُ
عُقْبَةَ الصُّنْعِ, meaning I experienced from him, or
it, difficulty: [as though lit. signifying, the result
of the deed that I had done:] and [simply]
لَقِىَ مِنْهُ عُقْبَةً He experienced from him, or it,
difficulty. (TA. [But in a copy of the A, and
in my opinion correctly, the last word in this
phrase is written ↓ عَقَبَةً: see عَقَبَةٌ, below.]) ―

is the mark &c. [of generosity and manliness, and
of beauty]. (S, O, K.) ―
-b2-  عِقْبَةُ القَمَرِ and ↓ عَقْبَةُ
القمر mean The return of the moon, when it has
set, or disappeared, and then risen: (L:) [or the
return of the moon after the change; for] one
says, مَا يَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ إِلَّا عِقْبَةَ القَمَرِ, (S,) or ↓ عُقْبَةَ
القمر, (so in the O,) meaning He does not that
save once in each month: (S, O:) but, accord. to
IAar, القَمَرِ ↓ عُقْبَةُ, with damm, is a certain star,
or asterism, which is in conjunction with the moon
once in the year; and عُقْبَةَ القَمَرِ means once in
the year: so in the following verse, of one of the
Benoo-'Ámir:
لَا يُطْعِمُ المِسْكَ وَالكَافُورَ لِمَّتَهُ
وَلَا الذَّرِيرَةَ إِلَّا عُقْبَةَ القَمَرِ
[He will not apply to his hair that descends below
the ear musk and camphor, nor the perfume called
ذريرة, save once in the year]: or, as Lh relates
it, عِقْبَةَ القمر: thus in the L; in which it is added
that this saying of IAar requires consideration,
because the moon cuts [a meridian of] the celestial
sphere once in every month: but MF replies that
it may be in conjunction with the said star only
once in the year, as the moon's path varies in
each successive month. (TA. [See also عَقْمَةٌ.])
-A2-  See also عَقْبَةٌ.
عَقَبَةٌ [A mountain-road;] a road in [or upon]
a mountain: (Bd in xc. 11:) or a road in the
upper part of a mountain: (Ham p. 287:) or a
difficult place of ascent of the mountains: (K:)
or it is in a mountain and the like thereof: (Msb:)
or [it sometimes signifies] a long mountain that
lies across the way, and over which the way therefore leads; long, or high, and very difficult; so
called, too, when it is further impassable after it
is ascended; rising high towards the sky, ascending and descending; most difficult of ascent; but
sometimes its height is one [or uniform]; and its
acclivity is in appearance like a wall: (TA:)
[generally it means a road over, or up, or down,
or over some part of, a mountain:] pl. عِقَابٌ.
(S, O, Msb, K.) اِقْتَحَمَ العَقَبَةَ [properly signifying He attempted the mountain-road] is metaphorically used as meaning He entered upon a
hard, or difficult, affair. (Bd in xc. 11.) See
also عُقْبَةٌ, near the end. ―
-b2-  It is also n. un. of
عَقَبٌ [q. v.]. (S, O.)

fear; in which it is said of that prayer, كَانَتْ
عُقْبَى [It was an affair of turns]; meaning that

several companies performing it successively, by
turns. (TA. [Compare عُقْبَةٌ as expl. in the
third sentence of the paragraph on that word.])

رَجُلٌ عِقِبَّانٌ A rough, coarse, or rude, man;
syn. غَلِيظٌ: pl. عقبان [so in the TA, either عِقْبَانٌ
or عُقْبَانٌ]: mentioned by Kr: but Az doubted
its correctness. (TA.)
عُقَابٌ [The eagle;] a certain bird, (S, O, K,)
of those that prey, (Msb,) well known: (K:) of
the fem. gender: (S, O, Msb:) [though] applied
to the male and the female; but with this distinction, that you say of the male, هٰذَا عُقَابٌ ذَكَرٌ
[This is a male eagle]: or it is only female; and
a bird of another kind couples with it; whence
Ibn-'Oneyn says, satirizing a person named Ibn-Seyyideh, Say thou to Ibn-Seyyideh,
مَا أَنْتَ إِلَّا كَالْعُقَابِ فَأُمُّهُ
مَعْرُوفَةٌ وَلَهُ أَبٌ مَجْهُولُ
[“ Thou art not other than the like of the eagle; ”
for his mother is known, but he has a father unknown]: (MF, TA:) the pl. (of pauc., S, O) is
أَعْقُبٌ, (S, O, K,) because it is of the fem. gender
and the measure أَفْعُلٌ specially belongs to pls. of
fem. nouns [though not to such exclusively], (S,
O,) and أَعْقِبَةٌ, (Kr, TA,) and (of mult., S, O)
عِقْبَانٌ (S, O, K) and عَقَائِبُ accord. to AHei, but
Ed-Demámeenee thinks this to be strange; and
pl. pl. عَقَابِينُ. (TA.) عِقْبَانُ الجِرْذَانِ [The eagles
that prey upon the large field-rats] are not black,
but of the colour termed كُهْبَة; and no use is
made of their feathers, except that boys feather
with them round-topped pointless arrows. (AHn,
TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] العُقَابُ is the name of (assumed tropical:)  One of
the northern constellations, [i. e. Aquila,] the stars
of which are nine within the figure, and six without, of the former of which are three well known,
called النَّسْرُ الطَّائِرُ [q. v.]. (Kzw.) ―
-b3-  [Hence
also,] (assumed tropical:)  The عُقَاب of the banner, or standard; (S,
O;) [app. meaning the flag attached to a lance;]
what is bound [to a lance] for a prefect, or governor; likened to the bird so called; and of the
fem. gender. (L, TA.) It is also the name of
(assumed tropical:)  The banner, or standard, of the Prophet. (O,
K.) And عُقَابٌ also means (assumed tropical:)  A large banner or
standard. (TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  i. q. غَايَةٌ: so in the
saying of Aboo-Dhu-eyb, describing wine,
لَهَا غَايَةٌ تَهْدِى الكِرَامَ عُقَابُهَا
[meaning It has a banner, which guides the generous; like as the military banner guides and attracts warriors: for غَايَةٌ sometimes signifies a
sign which the vintner used to set up to attract
customers]: the repetition is approvable because
of the difference of the two words in themselves:
pl. عِقْبَانٌ. (TA.) ―
-b4-  عُقَابٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A
black she-camel; as being likened to the bird. [so
called], (AA, O.) ―
-b5-  And A stone (or piece of
rock, L) protruding in the inside of a well, which
lacerates the [leathern] bucket; (S, O, K, TA;)
sometimes it is before [i. e. above] the casing [of
stones or bricks]: it is when a mass of stone becomes displaced; and sometimes the water-drawer
stands upon it: it is of the fem. gender: pl. as
above. (TA.) And The stone upon which the
waterer stands, (O, K,) [accord. to SM,] projecting beyond the casing in a well, the same that
is meant in the next preceding sentence, (TA,)
[but this I think doubtful, for Sgh adds,] between
two stones which support it. (O.) Accord. to
IAar, the قَبِيلَة is a mass of stone, or rock, at the
mouth of a well; and the عُقَابَانِ are [two masses
of stone] at the two sides of the قبيلة, supporting
it. (TA.) And A rock, or mass of stone, projecting in the side of a mountain, like a stair, or
series of steps: (S, O, K:) or an ascent, like

latter is bound, or fastened: (O:) or, accord. to
Az, the thread that binds the two extremities of the
ring of the قُرْط. (TA.) ―

to divorcement], i. e., one follows the other;
(Msb;) and [by alternation,] as when one says of
the night and the day, كُلُّ وَاحِدٍ مِنْهُمَا عَقِيبُ
صَاحِبِهِ [Each of them is the alternating sequent
of its correlative]: (Az, Msb, TA:) you say of
the night and the day, هُمَا عَقِيبَانِ [They are two
alternating sequents]; and عَقِيبُكَ signifies He
who does a deed, or work, with thee by turn, he
doing it one time and thou another: (A, * TA:)
and ↓ مُعَاقِبٌ signifies the same, (S, Msb,) as also
[↓ مُعْقِبٌ and ↓ مُعْتَقِبٌ and] ↓ مُعَقِّبٌ. (Msb.) As
for the saying of the lawyers, يَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ عَقِيبَ
الصَّلَاةِ [meaning He does that after the prayer],
and the like thereof, there is no reason to be
given but a suppression; the meaning being, فِى
وَقْتٍ عَقِيب وَقْتِ الصَّلَاةِ [in a time following that of
prayer], عقيب being an epithet qualifying وقت:
(Msb:) and Er-Rázee says, in the Mukhtár es-
Siháh, that he had found no authority in the T
nor in the S for the phrase جَآءَ عَقِيبَهُ meaning
He came after him. (TA.) See also عَقِبٌ, first

feed freely, after eating of the [kind of plants
called] حَمْض: [or] they are not so called unless
they be camels that, in a severe year, eat of trees,
and then of the حمض; not when they pasture
upon fresh, juicy, or tender, herbage. (IAar,
TA.) And إِبِلٌ عَوَاقِبُ Camels that drink water,

some of the Arabs of the desert read مَعَاقِيبُ:
(TA:) this [may be an anomalous pl. of عَقِيبٌ,
like as مَهَاجِينُ is of هَجِينٌ, or it] is pl. of مُعَقِّبٌ

female,
حَتَّى تَهَجَّرَ بِالرَّوَاحِ وَهَاجَهَا
طَلَبَ المُعَقِّبِ حَقَّهُ المُظْلُومُ
(S, O, but in the latter فِى الرَّوَاحِ,) i. e. [Until he
went along in the midday heat, (بالرواح or فى
الرواح being redundant,)] and drove her on [by
a pursuit] like the seeking of him who is making repeated efforts, having been wronged, to obtain his
due: (O:) المظلوم is an epithet qualifying
المعقّب, and is in the nom. case agreeable with
the meaning, (S, O,) because it is put after its
proper place; (O;) and المعقّب is literally in the
gen. case, but as to the meaning is an agent: (S,
O: *) or, accord. to some, المعقّب [here] signifies
the debtor who puts off the payment of his debt; so
that المظلوم is an agent and المعقّب is an objective
complement: (S:) or, as some say, المعقّب signifies
he who demands the payment of a debt and repeats
his demand thereof. (TA.) ―

meaning [And we slew, in El-Mahárik, (app. the

a sneeze and the prayer for the sneezer [which is
usually “ God have mercy on thee ”]: the memory
of the blood-revenger shall not die. (TA. [It is
there also said that العقب (app. a mistranscription
for ↓ المُعَقِّبُ, as may be conjectured from the fact
that the م after the article is often indistinctly
written, and inferred on other grounds,) is syn.
with المُعَاقِبُ as here explained.])

يَعْقُوبٌ, perfectly decl., because it is an Arabic
word, not altered, and, although having an augmentative letter at the beginning, not of the
measure of a verb; whereas يعقوب as a proper
name of foreign origin is imperfectly decl.; (S,
O;) The حَجَل [or partridge]: (K:) or the
male of the حَجَل; (S, O, Msb;) or of the قَبْج;
(Lh, Mgh;) but ISd says, I know not whether
Lh mean by this the حَجَل or the قَطَا or the
كَرَوَان, nor do I know that the قَبْح is the same
as the حَجَل: (TA:) and the male of the قَطَا [or
sand-grouse]: (TA:) pl. يَعَاقِيبُ. (S, Mgh, O,
Msb.) كَأَنَّكُمْ يَعَاقِيبُ الحَجَلِ, occurring in a
trad., means [As though ye were the males of
partridges] in your haste, and your flying into
destruction: for they are such that, when they
see the female in the possession of the fowler,
they throw themselves upon him, so as to fall
into his hand. (Z, TA in art. ركب.) ―
-b2-  And
accord. to some, (TA,) the pl. also signifies
Horses: they being thus termed as being likened
to the يعاقيب of the حَجَل, (O, TA,) because of
their swiftness: (TA:) so in the phrase رَكْضَ
اليَعَاقِيبِ [As the running of the horses, or of the
swift horses]; in a verse of Selámeh Ibn-Jendel:
(O, TA:) but others say that the meaning [here]
is, the males of the حَجَل. (TA.) It is said in
the L that فَرَسٌ يَعْقُوبٌ means A horse that has a
run after another run [or the power of repeating
his running] (ذُو عَقْبٍ [or عَقِبٍ]). (TA.) ―
-b3-  J has
cited [in the S] the words of a poet,
عَالٍ يُقَصِّرُ دُونَهُ اليَعْقُوبُ
[High, so that the يعقوب falls short of reaching
it] as an ex. of the last word meaning the male of
the حَجَل: but IB says that it appears to mean
in this case the male of the عُقَاب [or eagle]; like
as اليَرْخُومُ means the male of the رَخَم; and
اليَحْبُورُ, the male of the حُبَارَى; for the حَجَل is
not known to have so high a flight: and ElFarezdak describes يَعَاقِيب as congregating with
vultures over the slain. (TA.)
اليَعْقُوبِيَّةُ [a coll. gen. n., n. un. يَعْقُوبِىٌّ,] the
name of A sect of the خَوَارِج, followers of Yaakoob
Ibn-'Alee El-Koofee. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And A sect of
the Christians; the followers of Yaakoob ElBarádi'ee [or Jacobus Baradæus], who assert
the unity of the divine and human natures [in the
person of Christ], and who are the most unbelieving
and stubborn of the Christians: so says El-Mak-
reezee, in one of his tracts. (TA.)
