عشر1
عَشَرَ, (K,) aor.
عَشُرَ, as is expressly stated by
the expositors of the Fs and by others, but F,
confounding two usages of the verb, says
عَشِرَ,
(TA,) inf. n. عَشْرٌ, (TA,) He took one from ten.
(K.) ―
-b2-  And عَشَرَهُمْ He took one from among
them, they being ten. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  And عَشَرَهُمْ, (S,
K,) aor.
عَشُرَ, (S, O, TA,) accord. to the K
عَشِرَ, but
this is at variance with other authorities, as mentioned above, (TA,) inf. n. عَشْرٌ, (K,) or عُشْرٌ, with
damm, (S, O,) the former correct, but the latter
is preferred by MF, who quotes it from the
Expositions of the Fs, (TA,) and عُشُورٌ; (K;)
and ↓ عشّرهُمْ, (O, K,) inf. n. تَعْشِيرٌ; (TA;) He
took from them the عُشْر [i. e. the tenth, or, by extension of the term in the Muslim law, the half of the
tenth, or the quarter of the tenth,] of their several
kinds of property. (S, O, K.) And in like manner you say, (TA,) عَشَرَ المَالَ, (Msb, TA,) aor.
عَشُرَ,
inf. n. عَشْرٌ and عُشُورٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ عشّرهُ; (TA;)
He took the عُشْر of the property. (Msb, TA.) It
is said in a trad., respecting women, لَا يُعْشَرْنَ,
meaning, They shall not have the tenth of the
value of their ornaments taken. (TA.) ―
-b4-  عَشَرَ,
aor.
عَشِرَ, He added one to nine. (L, K.) [In the
TA and CK, this signification is connected with
the first mentioned above, at the commencement
of this art., by أَوْ, instead of وَ, which latter is
evidently the right reading.] ―
-b5-  And عَشَرَهُمْ,
aor.
عَشِرَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. عَشْرٌ, (S, O, Msb,)
He became the tenth of them: (S, O, Msb, K:)
or he made them ten by [adding to their number]
himself. (TA.) [See also 2: and see Q. Q. 1.]

عَشَّرَ see 1, in two places. ―
-b2-  عشّرهُمْ, (O, Msb,
TA,) inf. n. تَعْشِيرٌ, (TA,) also signifies He made
them ten, by adding one to nine. (O, Msb, TA.
[See وَحَّدَهُ.]) And العَدَدَ ↓ اعشر He made the
number ten. (TA.) ―
-b3-  عشّر المُصْحَفَ, inf. n. تَعْشِيرٌ,
He put, in the copy of the Kur-án, [the marks
called] the عَوَاشِر [pl. of عَاشِرَةٌ]. (S, O, K. *) ―
-b4-
اَللّٰهُمَّ عَشِّرْ خُطَاىَ O God, write down ten good
deeds for every one of my steps. (Lh, TA.) ―
-b5-
عشّر لِامْرَأَتِهِ, or عِنْدَهَا, He remained ten nights
with his wife: and in like manner the verb is
used in relation to any saying or action. (TA
voce سَبَّعَ.) ―
-b6-  عشّرت, (S, Msb, K, [in the CK
عَشَرَت,]) inf. n. تَعْشِيرٌ; (S;) and ↓ اعشرت; (K;)
She (a camel) became what is termed عُشَرَآء; (S,
K;) she completed the tenth month of her pregnancy. (Msb.) ―
-b7-  And عشّروا Their camels became such as are termed عِشَار [pl. of عُشَرَآءُ]. (O.)
―
-b8-  See also 4. ―
-b9-  عشّر القَدَحَ He broke the قدح
[or drinking-bowl] into ten pieces. (O, TA.) ―
-b10-
And [hence, app.,] عشّر الحُبُّ قَلْبَهُ (assumed tropical:)  Love emaciated him [as though it broke his heart into ten
pieces]. (TA.) ―
-b11-  And عشّر, (A, K,) inf. n.
تَعْشِيرٌ, (S, O, K,) He (an ass) brayed with ten
uninterrupted reciprocations of the sound. (S, A,
O, K. *) They assert that, when a man arrived
at a country of pestilence, he put his hand behind
his ear, and brayed in this manner, like an ass,
and then entered it, and was secure from the pestilence: (S, * O, TA:) or he so brayed at the gate
of a city where he feared pestilence, and conse-
quently it did not hurt him. (A.) ―
-b12-  Also He
(a hyena) cried, or howled, in the same manner.
(A.) And He (a raven) croaked in the same
manner. (K.)

-b7-  And اعشر He was, or became, one whose camels came to water on the tenth
day, counting the day of the next preceding water-ing as the first; expl. by the words وَرَدَتْ إِبِلُهُ

-b8-  And He came
to be within [the period of] the [first] ten [nights]
of Dhu-l-Hijjeh (فِى عَشْرِ ذِى الحِجَّةِ). (T, TA.)

Q. Q. 1
عَشْرَنَهُ He made it twenty: an extr.
word [with respect to formation, and post-classical, like سَبْعَنَ, q. v.]. (K, TA.) [In the CK,
عَشَرْتُهُ, and expl. there as signifying I made it
twenty: but this is evidently a mistranscription.]
عَشْرٌ fem. of عَشَرَةٌ [q. v.].
عُشْرٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ عُشُرٌ (TA) A tenth;
a tenth part; one part of ten parts; as also
↓ عَشِيرٌ and ↓ مِعْشَارٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;) which last
is [of a form] not used [to denote a fractional
part] except as applied to the tenth part (S, O) and
[in the instance of مِرْبَاعٌ applied to] the fourth part:
(O:) or, as some say, مِعْشَارٌ is the tenth of the
tenth [i. e. a hundredth part]: and as some say,
مِعْشَارٌ is the tenth of the ↓ عَشِير, which latter is
the tenth of the عُشْر; so that, accord. to this, the
معشار is one of a thousand; for it is the tenth of
the tenth of the tenth: (Msb:) [in the TA, “and
as some say, معشار is pl. of عشير, which latter is
pl. of عُشْرٌ: ” but this is evidently a mistake:] the
pl. of عُشْرٌ is أَعْشَارٌ (Msb, K) and عُشُورٌ; (K;) and
that of ↓ عَشِيرٌ is أَعْشِرَآءُ: (S, O, Msb:) it is said
in a trad., تِسْعَةُ أَعْشِرَآءِ الرِّزْقِ فِى التِّجَارَةِ وَجُزْءٌ مِنْهَا
فِى السَّابِيَآءِ, i. e. [Nine tenths of the means of subsistence consist in merchandise, and one part of
them consists in] the increase of animals. (S, A, *
O. *) ―
-b2-  أَخَذَ عُشْرَ أَمْوَالِهِمْ [means He took the
tenth, or tithe, or by extension of the term in the
Muslim law, the half of the tenth, or the quarter
of the tenth, of their several kinds of property].
(S, K.) [See 1, and see عَشَّارٌ.]
-A2-  عُشْرٌ [as a pl. of
which the sing. is not mentioned], applied to she-camels, That excern into the udder (تُنْزِلُ) a
scanty دِرَّة [or quantity of milk (in the CK دَرَّة)]
without its collecting [and increasing]. (O, K.)
عِشْرٌ A period of eight days between [camels']
twice coming to water; for they come to water
on the tenth day [counting the day of the next
preceding watering as the first]; and in like manner, the term for every one of the periods between
two waterings is with kesr: [see ثِلْثٌ:] (S, O:)
or camels' coming to water on the tenth day [after
the next preceding period of abstinence, i. e., counting the day of the next preceding watering as the
first]: or on the ninth day [not counting the day of
the next preceding watering; for it is evident that
these two explanations are virtually one and the
the same]; (K;) as in the Shems el-'Uloom, on
the authority of Kh, where it is added that they
keep them from the water nine nights and eight
days, and then bring them to water on the ninth
day, which is the tenth from [by which is meant
including] the former [day of] watering: (TA:)
after the عِشْر, there is no name for a period between the two waterings until the twentieth
[day]; (S, O;) but you say, هِىَ تَرِدُ عِشْرًا وَغِبًّا,
and عِشْرًا وَرِبْعًا, [and so on,] to the twentieth [day
counting the day of the next preceding watering
as the first]; (As;) and then you say, that their
period between two waterings is عِشْرَانِ, (As, S,
O,) i. e., eighteen days; (S, O;) and when they
exceed this, they are termed جَوَازِئُ [meaning
“ that satisfy themselves with green pasture so as
not to need water ”]. (As, S, O.) ―
-b2-  Also The
eighth young one, or offspring. (A in art. ثلث.)
-A2-  And A piece that is broken off from a cooking-pot, (K, TA,) or from a drinking-cup or
bowl, (TA,) and from anything; (K, TA;) as
though it were one of ten pieces; (TA;) as also
↓ عُشَارَةٌ, (K, TA,) which signifies a piece of anything: (O, TA:) pl. of the former, أَعْشَارٌ [and
pl. pl. أَعَاشِيرُ]; (TA;) and of ↓ the latter, عُشَارَاتٌ.
(O, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] بُرْمَةٌ أَعْشَارٌ A cookingpot, or one of stone, broken in pieces: thus [we
find the latter word] occurring in the pl. form
[and used as an epithet]. (S, O.) And قِدْرٌ أَعْشَارٌ
A cooking-pot broken into ten pieces: (K:) or a
large cooking-pot, of ten pieces joined together by
reason of its largeness: (A:) or a cooking-pot so
large that it is carried by ten men, (K,) or by ten
women: (TA:) or [simply] a cooking-pot broken
in pieces; not derived from anything: (TA:) pl.
قُدُورٌ أَعْشَارٌ, (A,) and أَعَاشِيرُ. (A, K.) And جَفْنٌ
أَعْشَارٌ [A scabbard of a sword, or a sword-case,]
broken in pieces. (O.) And قَلْبٌ أَعْشَارٌ [(assumed tropical:)  A
broken heart.] (S, K.) And أَعْشَارُ جَزُورٍ The
portions of a slaughtered camel [for which players
at the game called المَيْسِر contend, and which are
ten in number; not seven, as is said in one place
in the TA. In Har p. 579, اعشار in this case is said
to be pl. of عُشْرٌ; but I think that we have better
reason for regarding it as a pl. of عِشْرٌ]. (Az, S,
O, K.) Imra-el-Keys says,
وَمَا ذَرَفَتْ عَيْنَاكِ إِلَّا لِتَضْرِبِى
بِسَهْمَيْكِ فِى أَعْشَارِ قَلْبٍ مُقَتَّلِ
[And thine eyes did not shed tears but that thou
mightest play with thy two arrows for the portions
of a heart subdued and killed by the passion of
love]: he means, by the two arrows, the two
called المُعَلَّى and الرَّقِيب; to the former of which
are assigned seven portions, and to the latter,
three; so that both together gain all the portions;
for the slaughtered camel is divided into ten portions: therefore he means that she has played
for his heart with her two arrows, [alluding to
the glances shot from her eyes,] and gained possession of it altogether: (Az, S, * O: * [see also a
verse cited voce رَقِيبٌ:]) or accord. to some, he
means that his heart had been broken, and then
repaired like as cooking-pots are repaired: but
Az says that the former explanation, which is
mentioned by Th, pleases him more. (TA.) Hence
the saying, ضَرَبَ فِى أَعْشَارِهِ وَلَمْ يَرْضَ بِمِعْشَارِهِ
[He played for all the portions of it, and was not
content with the fifth of it]; meaning he took the
whole of it. (A.) ―
-b3-  And أَعْشَارٌ alone means
Cooking-pots that boil the ten portions [of a جَزُور].
(Har. p. 579.)
-A3-  أَعْشَارٌ also signifies The primary feathers of the wing of a bird; (S, O, TA;)
and so ↓ عَوَاشِرُ. (TA.)
عُشَرٌ Three nights of the [lunar] month, [the
tenth, eleventh, and twelfth,] after the تُسَع [q. v.].
(S, O.)
-A2-  Also [The asclepias gigantea of Linnæus; or gigantic swallow-wort;] a species of
tree [or shrub] in which is a substance answering
the purpose of tinder, (K,) like cotton, (TA,) than
which there is nothing better wherein to strike fire,
and with which cushions are stuffed, (K,) on account of its softness: (TA:) [see رَآءٌ, in art. روأ:]
accord. to AHn, (TA,) a large species of tree [or
shrub], of the kind called عِضَاه, having a sweet gum,
(AHn, S, O, *) and milk, (O,) and broad leaves,
growing up high, (AHn,) from the flowers and
shoots of which, (AHn, K,) or from the joints of
the branches and from the places of the flowers
whereof, (O,) there comes forth a well-known kind
of sugar, (AHn, O, * K,) in which is somewhat of
bitterness, (O, K,) called سُكَّرُ العُشَرِ; (AHn, TA;)
[or this is a kind of red sugar, which falls like
dew upon this tree; (Golius, from Ibn-Maaroof
and the Mj;)] it produces also bladders, resembling
the شَقَاشِق [or faucial bags] of camels, in which
they bray, [blowing them out from their months,
with a gurgling sound,] (AHn, TA,) [and] like
the bladder of the smaller قَتَاد [q. v.]; (S, O;)
and it has a blossom like that of the دِفْلَى, tinged,
[but with what hue is not said,] and shining, and
beautiful in appearance, as well as a fruit:
(AHn, TA:) n. un. with ة: and pl. [of this
latter] عُشَرٌ [or rather this is a coll. gen. n.] and
عُشَرَاتٌ. (S, O.) [See also سَلَعٌ.]
عُشُرٌ: see عُشْرٌ.
عِشْرَةٌ Social, or familar, intercourse; fellowship; i. q. مُخَالَطَةٌ; (O, * K;) or a subst. from
the latter word. (S, Msb.) Sometimes it governs
as a verb, [like the inf. n.,] accord. to some grammarians, as in the following ex.:
بِعِشْرَتِكَ الكِرَامَ تُعَدُّ مِنْهُمْ
[By thine associating with the generous thou will
be reckoned as one of them]. (I'Ak p. 211.)
عَشَرَةٌ [Ten;] the first of the عُقُود; (A, K;)
with ة, (Msb,) and with fet-h to the ش, (TA,)
for the masc.; (Msb, TA;) and عَشْرٌ, without ة,
(Msb, TA,) and with one fet-hah, (TA,) for the
fem. (Msb, TA.) You say, عَشَرَةُ رِجَالٍ [Ten
men]: and عَشْرُ نِسْوَةٍ [ten women]. (S, O, Msb,
TA.) [In De Sacy's Arabic Grammar, for the
former is inadvertently put عَشْرَةٌ; and for the
latter, عَشَرٌ; and in Freytag's lexicon we find
عَشَرٌ instead of عَشْرٌ.] عَشَرَاتٌ [is the pl. of عَشَرَةٌ:
and also] signifies Decimal numbers. (M in art.
ست.) The vulgar make عَشْرٌ masc., as meaning
a number of days, saying العَشْرُ الأَوَّلُ, and العَشْرُ
الأَخِيرُ; but this is wrong [unless thereby they mean
to speak of nights with their days, as will be shown
by what follows]: the month consists of three
عَشَرَات; namely, العَشْرُ الأُوَلُ [The first ten nights.
with their days], pl. of أُولَى; and العَشْرُ الوُسَطُ [The
middle ten nights, with their days], pl. of وُسْطَى;
and العَشْرُ الأَخَرُ [The last, lit. the other, ten nights,
with their days], pl. of أُخْرَى; or العَشْرُ الأَوَاخِرُ
[The last ten nights, with their days], pl. of آخرَةٌ.
(Msb.) [العَشْرُ الأَوَاخِرُ is also especially applied
to The last ten nights of Ramadán, with their
days: and عَشْرُ ذِى الحِجَّةِ to The first ten nights
of Dhu-l-Hijjeh, with their days: and العَشْرُ,
alone, to The first ten nights of El-Moharram,
with their days.] The Arabs also said, سِرْنَا عَشْرًا,
meaning We journeyed ten nights, with their
days; making the fem. [لَيَالٍ] to predominate
over the masc. [أَيَّام]; as is the case in the Kur
ii. 234. (Msb.) And أَيَّامُ العَشْرِ is used for أَيَّامُ
اللَّيَالِى العَشْرِ [The days of the ten nights].
(Mgh.) [See some other observations applying
to the syntax of عَشَرَةٌ and عَشْرٌ, voce خَمْسَةٌ. And
respecting a peculiar pronunciation of the people
of El-Hijáz, and a case in which عَشَرَة is imperfectly decl., see ثَلَاثَةٌ.] ―
-b2-  [عَشْرٌ is also applied to
A portion, or paragraph, of the Kur-án properly
consisting of ten verses; but it is often applied to
somewhat more, or less, than what is considered by
some, or by all, as ten verses, either because there
is much disagreement as to the divisions of the
verses or for the sake of beginning and ending
with a break in the tenour of the text: (see
عَاشِرَةٌ:) pl. أَعْشَارٌ. These divisions have no mark
to distinguish them in some MSS.: in others,
each is marked by a round ornament at the end;
or by the word عشر, or the letter ع, over, or over
against, the commencement.] ―
-b3-  When you have
passed the number ten, you make the masc. fem.,
and the fem. masc. [to nineteen inclusively]: in
the masc., you reject the ة in عَشَرَة; and from
thirteen to nineteen [inclusively], you add ة to
the former of the two nouns; and [in every case]
you pronounce the ش with fet-h; and you make
the two nouns one noun, [and, as such,] indecl.,
with fet-h for the termination: (TA:) you say,
أَحَدَ عَشَرَ [Eleven], (S, O, Msb,) [and اِثْنَا عَشَرَ
Twelve,] and ثَلَاثَةَ عَشَرَ [Thirteen], and so on;
(Msb, TA;) with fet-h to the ش; and in one
dial. with sukoon [أَحَدَ عَشْرَ, &c.]; (Msb;) or
the former only: (S, O:) and, as ISk says, some
of the Arabs make the ع quiescent, [as many do
in the present day,] saying أَحَدَ عْشَرَ, and so on
to تِسْعَةَ عْشَرَ [inclusively] except in the instance
of اِثْنَا عَشَرَ and اِثْنَىْ عَشَرَ, because of the quiescence
of the ا and ى; and Akh says that they make
the ع quiescent because the noun is long and its
vowels are many: (S, O) in the fem., you add
ة to the latter of the two nouns, and reject the ة
in the former of them, and make the ش in عشرة
quiescent: you say إِحْدَى عَشْرَةَ (TA,) [and اِثْنَتَا
عَشْرَةَ,] and so on to تِسْعَ عَشْرَةَ [inclusively]: and
if you choose, you say إِحْدَى عَشِرَةَ, [&c.,] with
kesr to the ش: the former is of the dial. of the
people of El-Hijáz, [and is the more common,]
and the latter is of the dial. of the people of
Nejd: (S, O, TA:) but fet-h to the ش in this
case is unknown to the grammarians and lexicologists, as Az says, though an instance has
been adduced in an unusual reading of the Kur
ii. 57, and another in vii. 160. (TA.) Every
noun of number, from eleven to nineteen [inclusively], is mansoob, [or more properly speaking,
each of the two nouns of which it is composed is
indecl., with fet-h,] in the cases of refa and nasb
and khafd, except that of twelve; for اِثْنَا and اِثْنَتَا
are decl. [i. e. you say, in a case of nasb or khafd,
اِثْنَىْ عَشَرَ and اِثْنَتَىْ عَشْرَةَ]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  [In the
same manner also عَشَرَ and عَشْرَةَ are used in the
ordinal compounds,]
عُشَرَآءُ A she-camel that has been ten months
pregnant, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) from the day of
her having been covered by the stallion: she then
ceases to be [of those] called مَخَاضً, and she is
called عشرا until she brings forth, and also after
she has brought forth, (S, O,) or when she has
brought forth, at the completion of a year: or
when she has brought forth she is termed عَاتِذٌ:
(TA:) or that has been eight months pregnant:
or, applied to a she-camel, i. q. نُفَسَآءُ applied to a
woman: (K:) it is applied also to any female
that is pregnant, but mostly to the female of the
horse and camel: (IAth:) it is the only sing.
word of this measure, which is a pl. measure,
except نُفَسَآءُ: (MF:) the dual is عُشَرَاوَانِ: (S,
O, TA; in one copy of the S عُشْرَاوَانِ:) and pl.
عُشَرَاوَاتٌ; (S, O, K, TA; in one copy of the S,
and in the CK عُشْراوات;) but some disallow
this; (MF;) and عِشَارٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;) like as
نِفَاسٌ is pl. of نُفَسَآءُ; (Msb;) and عُشَارٌ: (K in
art. نفس:) or عِشَارٌ is applied to she-camels until
some of them have brought forth and others are
expected to bring forth. (K.) Some say that
عِشَار have no milk; though El-Farezdak applies
this term to camels that are milked, because of
their having recently brought forth; and it is
said that camels are most precious to their owners
when they are عشار. (TA.) عَشَائِرُ, as pl. of عِشَارٌ,
which is pl. of عُشَرَآءُ, signifies Gazelles that have
recently brought forth. (O.)
لَبَنٌ عُشَرِىٌّ Milk of camels that feed upon the
عُشَر, q. v. (TA.)
عِشْرُونَ Twenty; twice ten: (K:) applied alike
to a masc. and a fem.: (Msb:) you say عِشْرُونَ
رَجُلًا [Twenty men], and عِشْرُونَ امْرَأَةً [Twenty
women: the noun following it being in the accus.
case as a specificative]: (TA:) it is decl. with
و and ى [like a pl. formed by the addition of و
and ن]; (Msb;) and when you prefix it to
another noun, making it to govern the latter in
the gen. case, you drop the ن, (S, Msb,) and
say, عِشْرُو زَيْدٍ [The twenty of Zeyd], (Msb,) and
عِشْرُوكَ [Thy twenty], (S, O, Msb,) and عِشُرِىّ
[My twenty], changing the و into ى [in this last
case], because of the letter following it, and these
incorporating: (S, O:) so says Ks; but most
disallow this mode of prefixing in the case of a
decimal number [of this kind], (Msb.) [It signifies also Twentieth.] It is not a pl. of عَشَرَةٌ, (so
in a copy of the S and in the O and in the TA.)
or عَشْرٌ, (so in another copy of the S,) [or perhaps
the right reading is عِشْرٌ, as may be inferred from
what will be presently added: but first it should
be observed that if it were pl. of عَشَرَةٌ, or of عَشْرٌ,
it would signify at least three times ten: some
hold it to be a pl. of عِشْرٌ, saying, (TA.) as عِشْرٌ
signifies camels' coming to water on the ninth
day, they do not say عِشْرَانِ [for twenty], but
they say عِشْرُونَ, (in the K, لَمْ يُقَلْ عِشْرَيْنِ وَقَالُوا
عِشْرِينَ: but the correct reading seems to be لَمْ
يَقُولُوا: TA: [in the CK it is more incorrect, لم
يقل عِشْرِينَ وقالوا عِشْرَيْنِ:]) making eighteen
days to be عِشْرَانِ, and the nineteenth and twentieth a portion of the third عِشْر; and so, [regarding the portion as a whole,] forming the pl.
عِشْرُونَ; (K, * TA;) agreeably with a well-known
license, which allows the calling two and a part
of the third a pl: (TA:) this is the opinion of
Kh and IDrd and some others: but J and most
of the lexicologists hold that عِشْرُونَ is not a pl.
of عَشَرَةٌ nor of عِشْرٌ nor of any other word, and
their opinion I hold to be correct, applying as
it does to the other similar nouns of number.
(MF.)
عُشَارَ Ten and ten; [or ten and ten together; or
ten at a time and ten at a time;] (MF;) changed
from عَشَرَة, (S,) or rather عَشَرَةً عَشَرَةً; as also
↓ مَعْشَرَ; (MF;) [for which reason, and its
having the quality of an epithet, each is imperfectly decl.] You say, جَاؤُوا عُشَارَ عُشَارَ, (S, M,
O, L, K,) and ↓ مَعْشَرَ مَعْشَرَ, (M, O, L, K,) and
عُشَارَ once, and ↓ مَعْشَرَ once, (M, L, TA,) They
came ten [and] ten. (S, M, O, L, K.) MF says
that the repetition is manifestly wrong; but it is
allowed by the M and L, as well as the K; [and
is for the purpose of corroboration;] and مَعْشَرَ
↓ مَعْشَرَ is also authorized by the TS. (TA.)
A'Obeyd says that more than أُحَادَ and ثُنَآءَ and
ثُلَاثَ and رُبَاعَ has not been heard, except عُشَارَ
occurring in a verse of El-Kumeyt. (O, TA.)
[But خُمَاسَ is mentioned in the K.]
عَشِيرٌ: see عُشْرٌ, in three places. ―
-b2-  Also A certain measure of land, a tenth of the قَفِيز, (O,
Msb, K,) which is the tenth of the جَرِيب [q. v.]:
(O, TA:) pl. أَعْشِرَآءُ. (TA in art. جرب.)
-A2-  And
An associate; i. q. مُعَاشِرٌ. (S, O, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-
And A husband; (S, O, Msb, K;) because he
and his wife are associates, each of the other. (S,
O.) يَكْفُرْنَ العَشِيرَ means They are ungrateful to
the husband. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  And A wife. (Msb.)
―
-b4-  And A relation. (K.) ―
-b5-  And A friend.
(K.) Pl. عُشَرَآءُ. (K.) ―
-b6-  See also عَشِيرَةٌ.
-A3-
Also The cry of the ضَبُع [or hyena, or female
hyena]: (K:) in this sense, a word not derived.
(TA.)
عُشَارَةٌ; and its pl.: see عِشْرٌ.
عُشَارِىٌّ A garment, or piece of cloth, (A, K,)

-b2-  And A
boy ten years old: fem. with ة. (TA.)
عَشُورَى and عَشُورَآءُ: see عَاشُورَآءُ.
عَشِيرَةٌ A man's kinsfolk: (Bd and Jel in ix. 24:)
or his nearer or nearest relations, or next of kin,
by descent from the same father or ancestor:
(K:) or a small sub-tribe; a small portion, or
the smallest subdivision, of a tribe, less than a
فَصِيلَة: (TA voce شَعْبٌ, q. v.:) or a tribe; syn
قَبِيلَةٌ; (S, O, Msb;) a man's قَبِيلَة; (K;) as also
↓ عَشِيرٌ, without ة: (TA:) or a community, such
as the Benoo-Temeem, and the Benoo-'Amr-Ibn-Temeem: (ISh:) a word having no proper sing.:
(Msb:) accord. to some, from عِشْرَةٌ: accord. to
others, from عَشَرَةٌ, the number so called: (Bd ubi
suprà, and MF:) pl. عَشَائِرُ (Msb, K) and عَشِيرَاتُ.
(Msb.) [See also مَعْشَرٌ.]
-A2-  عَشَائِرُ is also a pl.
pl. of عُشَرَآءُ [q. v., last sentence]. (O.)
عَشَّارٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ عَاشِرٌ (O, Msb, K)
and ↓ مُعَشِّرٌ (TA) One who takes, or receives, the
عُشْر [q. v.] of property. (S, Msb, K.) Where
the punishment of the عَشَّار, or عَاشِر, is mentioned
in traditions, as where it is said that the عَاشِر is to
be put to death, the meaning is, he who takes the
tenth as the people in the Time of Ignorance used
to do: such is to be put to death because of his
unbelief; or because, being a Muslim, he holds
this practice to be lawful: but such as performed
the like office for the Prophet and for the Khaleefehs after him may be thus called because of the
relation of what he takes to the tenth, as the
quarter of the tenth, and the half of the tenth,
and as he takes the tenth wholly of the produce
that is watered [only] by the rain, and the tenth
of the property in merchandise [of foreigners, and
half the tenth of that] of non-Muslim subjects.
(TA.) [There is either a mistake or an omission
in the last part of the statement above, in the
TA, which I have rectified by inserting “ of
foreigners ” &c.]
عَاشِرٌ: see عَشَّارٌ. ―
-b2-  One says also, صَارَ عَاشِرَهُمْ
[meaning he became the tenth of them]. (S,
Msb, K.)
عَاشِرَةٌ The circular sign which marks a division
of an 'ashr (عَشْر) in a copy of the Kur-án: (O,
L, K:) a post-classical term: (O, L:) pl. عَوَاشِرُ.
(S, K.) ―
-b2-  And عَوَاشِرُ القُرْآنِ means The verses
that complete an عَشْر of the Kur-án. (K.) ―
-b3-  And
إِبِلٌ عَوَاشِرُ Camels coming to water after an interval of eight days; (S, O;) on the tenth day [counting the day of the next preceding watering as the
first]: or on the ninth day [not counting the day
of the next preceding watering: see عِشْرٌ]. (K.)
-A2-  For another signification of the pl., عَوَاشِرُ, see
عِشْرُ, last sentence.
-A3-  عَاشِرَةُ is a proper name of
The ضَبُع [i. e. hyena, or female hyena]; a determinate noun: [but it has for] pl. عَاشِرَاتٌ. (O.)
عَاشُورٌ: see what next follows.
عَاشُورَآءُ and ↓ عَشُورَآءُ (Msb, K) and عَاشُورَى
(Msb, K) and ↓ عَشُورَى (K) and ↓ عَاشُورٌ, (Msb,
K,) or يَوْمُ عَاشُورَآءَ (S, O, and K in art. تسع, &c.)
or يَوْمُ العَاشُورَآءِ (S in that art., &c.) and يَوْمُ عَشُورَآءَ,
(S, O,) The tenth day of the month El-Moharram:
(S, Msb, K:) or the ninth thereof, (K,) accord. to
some; but most of the learned, of old and late
times, agree that it is the former; (Msb in art.
تسع;) and AZ says that by the ninth may be
meant the tenth; after the same manner as the
term عِشْرٌ, relating to camels' coming to water, is
[said to be] applied to a period of nine days, [but
means the coming to water on the tenth day,
counting the day of the next preceding watering
as the first,] as Lth says, on the authority of Kh.
(TA.) Few nouns of the measure فَاعُولَآءُ have
been heard. (Az, TA.)
مَعْشَرٌ A company, or collective body, (Az, S, O,
Msb, K,) of people, (S,) consisting of men, exclusive of women; like نَفَرٌ and قَوْمٌ and رَهْطٌ; (Az,
Msb;) having no proper sing.: (Az:) or any
company, or collective body, whose state of circumstances is one; a community; as the معشر of the
Muslims and that of the Polytheists: (Lth:) or
a great company, or collective body; so called
[from عَشَرَةٌ,] because they are many; for عشرة is
that large and perfect number after which there
is no number but what is composed of the units
comprised in it: (MF:) or the family of a man:
or jinn (i. e. genii) and mankind: (K: [or the
author of the K may mean, or jinn: and also
mankind:]) in the Kur [vi. 130, and lv. 33], we
find the expression يَا مَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالْإِنْسِ; but this
means O معشر consisting of the jinn and of mankind: and [vi. 128], يَا مَعْشَرَ الجِنِّ, without the
mention of الانس: (MF:) pl. مَعَاشِرُ. (S, Msb.)
[See also عَشِيرَةٌ.]
-A2-  مَعْشَرَ: see عُشَارَ, in four
places.
مُعْشِرٌ (tropical:)  A woman who has completed her full
time of pregnancy. (TA.)
