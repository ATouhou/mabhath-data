عظم1
عَظُمَ, [aor.
عَظُمَ,] inf. n. عِظَمٌ (S, Msb, K) and
عَظَامَةٌ, (Msb, K,) accord. to El-Isbahánee, primarily signifies He was, or became, great in his
bone: then metaphorically said of anything كَبِير
[or great], whether an object of sense or of intel-lect, a substance or an accident: (TA:) i. q. كَبُرَ,
(S, TA,) said of a thing [as meaning it was, or
became, great, big, or large], (S, Msb, TA,) in
length and breadth and thickness: (TA:) [and in
like manner, metaphorically, said of an object of
intellect; meaning it was, or became, great in
estimation or rank or dignity; and thus also said
of a man: or it imports more than كَبُرَ; signifying it was, or became, great in comparison with
other things of its kind; huge, enormous, or vast;
and in a similar sense it is said of a man; and in
an incomparably higher sense, of God: (see عَظِيمٌ,
below:)] and ↓ اعظم said of an affair, or event,
signifies [like عَظُمَ] it became عَظِيم. (TA.) عِظَمٌ
is the contr. of صِغَرٌ. (K.) ―
-b2-  عَظُمَ عِنْدَهُ, and
عَظُمَ عَلَيْهِ: see 6, in three places: and see also 4.

-b3-  In the case of expressing
wonder, one says, عُظْمَ البَطْنُ بَطْنُكَ [How great
is the belly, thy belly !], contracting عَظُمَ, and
transferring the vowel of its middle letter to [the
place of] its first; and thus one does in the case
of that which denotes praise or blame, and of
whatever [verb] may be well used in the manner
of نِعْمَ, and بِئْسَ: but what may not be thus used
does not admit of the transferring, though it may
be contracted; so that you may say, حَسُنَ الوَجْهُ
وَجْهُكَ and حَسْنَ الوَجْهُ وَجْهُكَ and حُسْنَ الوَجْهُ
وَجْهُكَ, but not قَدْ حُسْنَ الوَجْهُ وَجْهُكَ. (S.)

(TA:) or عَظِيمٌ signifies esteemed great &c. by

signifies “ great &c. in itself: ” (El-Fakhr Er-Rázee, TA:) or the former is the contr. of حَقِيرٌ;

and as حَقِيرٌ is inferior to صَغِيرٌ, so عَظِيمٌ is superior to كَبِيرٌ; (Ksh and Bd in ii. 6;) and signifies great, or the like, in comparison with other
things of its kind: (Bd ibid:) [it may therefore
often be rendered huge, enormous, or vast: used
metaphorically, as applied to an object of the intellect, it means great in estimation or rank or
dignity; and thus as applied to a man: also of
great magnitude or moment or importance: of
great gravity: difficult, hard, severe, grievous,
distressing, afflictive, troublesome, or burdensome:
