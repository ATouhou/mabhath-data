(A 'Obeyd, as cited in the TA: [but for عَيْشِ غَزِىّ
in my original, we should perhaps read عَيْشٍ عَزِيزٍ,
i. e. a difficult state of life:) or thou benefitest at
one time, and injurest at another (TA. And a
man to whom IAar said “ How is such a one '”
answered عَيْشٌ وَجَيْشٌ, meaning At one time with

مَعَاشٌ and ↓ مَعِيشٌ may be used as substantives

TA;) and signify, like مَعِيشَةٌ, That whereby one
lives: or that [place and time] in which one lives:
(TA:) [or rather, they have both these significations; but معاش has generally the latter. whereas
معيشة, q. v., and معيش, are generally used in the
former sense, or one similar to it:] مَعَاشٌ also
signifies the place of subsistence; or the known,
or usual, place thereof: and the time wherein one
seeks sustenance. (TA.) Thus, (TA,) الأَرْضُ
مَعَاشُ الخَلْقِ [The earth is the place of subsistence
of mankind, or of the created beings]. (A, O, TA.)

-b2-  Also
Victuals, living, sustenance, or food and drink by
which one lives; (Lth, A, O, K;) as also ↓ عَيْشٌ;
(A;) whence you say that dates are the عَيْش of
such a family: (TA:) that whereby life subsists;
the means of life or subsistence; (A, K;) as also
↓ عَيْشٌ: (A, TA:) that whereby one lives; as
also ↓ عَيْشٌ (A, K, TA) and ↓ مَعَاشٌ and ↓ مَعِيشٌ;
(TA;) or [the state] wherein one lives; (A, K,
TA;) as also ↓ عَيْشٌ (A) and ↓ مَعَاشٌ and ↓ مَعِيشٌ:
(TA:) the means of obtaining that whereby one
lives: (Aboo-Is-hák, TA:) the gain, or earnings,
by means of which a man lives; (Mgh, Msb;)
as also ↓ مَعِيشٌ: (Msb:) the pl. is مَعَايِشُ, (S,
O, Msb,) accord. to general opinion, (Msb,) without ء, (S, O, Msb,) when formed from the original
of the sing., which is مَعْيِشَةٌ, of the measure
مَفْعِلَةٌ; (S, O;) or because it is from عَاشَ, so
that the measure of the pl. is مَفَاعِلُ: (Msb:)
but when it is formed from the secondary form of
the sing., it is with ء, [مَعَائِشُ,] مَفْعِلَةٌ being in
this case likened to فَعِيلَةٌ, like as مَصَائِبُ is with ء
because the ى [in its sing.] is quiescent; but
some of the grammarians hold this latter pl. to be
incorrect: (S, O:) all the Basree grammarians
hold it to be so: (TA:) or, accord. to some,
↓ مَعِيشٌ and مَعِيشَةٌ are from معش; and the pl.
in question is therefore of the measure فَعَائِلُ,
with ء. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  مَعِيشَةٌ ضَنْكٌ The punishment
of the grave: (O, K:) so, accord. to most of the
expositors, in the Kur xx. 123: or, as some say,
[strait sustenance] in the fire of hell. (O, TA.)
مُتَعَيِّشٌ One who constrains himself to obtain the
means of life: (TA:) or who has what is barely
sufficient, of sustenance, nothing remaining over
and above it. (Lth, A, O, K.)
