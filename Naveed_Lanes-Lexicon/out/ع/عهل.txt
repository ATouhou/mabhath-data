عهلQ. Q. 1
عَيْهَلْتُ الإِبلَِ I left the camels to pasture by themselves, without a pastor, by night and
by day: mentioned by IB, on the authority of
A'Obeyd: and he cites as an ex.,
عَيْهَلَهَا الذُّوَّادُ ↓ عَيَاهِلُ
[app. meaning Camels left to pasture by themselves,
the drivers having left them to do so]. (TA.)
عَاهِلٌ A paramount sovereign, like a خَلِيفَة.
(S, O, K.) ―
-b2-  And A woman having no husband:
[probably because of her independence:] (AO, S,
O, K:) pl. عَوَاهِلُ. (O.)
عَيْهَلٌ A swift she-camel; as also هَيْهَلَةٌ; (S, O,
K;) and so ↓ عَيْهُولٌ and ↓ عَيْهَالٌ: (IDrd, * O, * K:)
or all signify an excellent, strong, she-camel: (K:)
or عَيْهَلٌ signifies a large, big, she-camel; or a tall
she-camel: (TA:) [see an ex. in a verse cited in
the first paragraph of art. جهم:] and it is also
applied to the male of camels, (K, TA,) as some
say; (TA;) and عَيْهَلَةٌ to the female; (K, TA;)
but, (TA,) accord. to AHát, one should not say
جَمَلٌ عَيْهَلٌ; (S, O, TA;) and some say that one
should apply to a she-camel the epithet عَيْهَلَةٌ
only: (TA:) sometimes, by poetic license, they
said عَيْهَلٌّ. (S, O.) ―
-b2-  Also, applied to a man,
and عَيْهَلَةٌ applied to a woman, (K,) or both
applied to a woman, (S,) That will not remain
in one place, by reason of lightness, or unsteadiness, or lightwittedness, (S, K, TA,) going to and
fro, forwards and backwards. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And
the former, A tall woman: (K, TA:) or a strong
woman. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And عَيْهَلَةٌ An old, aged,
woman. (O, K, * TA.) ―
-b5-  And رِيحٌ عَيْهَلٌ A
strong, or violent, wind. (S, O, K. *) ―
-b6-  عَيَاهِلُ
[a pl., of which the sing. is probably عَيْهَلٌ or
عَيْهَلَةٌ,] see in the first paragraph.
