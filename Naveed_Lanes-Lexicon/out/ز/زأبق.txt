زأبقQ. 1
زَأْبَقَ He did over dirhems, or pieces of
money, with زِئْبِق [i. e. quicksilver]. (Mgh.) [It
is said that] the verb [from زئبق, or rather its
inf. n.,] is التَّزْبِيقُ: (TA:) [but see مَزَأْبَقٌ, below.]
زِئْبِقٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) thus pronounced by
some, (S,) and this is the form preferred by ElMeydánee, and that which is in the Fs and its
Expositions, (TA,) rendered quasi-coordinate to
زِئْبِرٌ and ضِئْبِلٌ, (S, in which it is mentioned in
art. زبق,) also pronounced زِئْبَقٌ, (S, K, [in both
of which it is implied that this is the more common form, and such is the case now,]) and it
is allowable to pronounce it زِيبِقٌ, (Msb,) an
arabicized word, (S, K,) of well-known meaning,
[i. e. Quicksilver,] (Msb, K,) originally Pers.
[Cِيوَهْ and زِيبَقْ or زِيبِقْ]; (S;) i. q. زَاوُوقٌ: (Mgh,
TA:) some of it is drawn in a fluid state from
its mine, and some is extracted from stones of the
mine by means of fire: its smoke, or vapour, puts
to flight serpents and scorpions from the house,
or kills such of them as remain [therein]. (K.)
―
-b2-  Hence, as being likened thereto, (TA,) زِئْبِقٌ
and زِئْبَقٌ signify also (tropical:)  A man who is light, inconstant, unsteady, irresolute, or fickle. (Ibn-
'Abbád, TA.)
[
زِئْبَقِىٌّ Of, or relating to, quicksilver. ―
-b2-  And
A seller of quicksilver.]
دِرْهَمٌ مُزَأْبَقٌ, (Lth, S, Mgh, TA,) said by Th to
be correctly مَزَأْبِقٌ, with kesr to the ب, (TA in
art. زبق, [but this is app. a mistake,]) or مُزَيْبَقٌ,
with fet-h to the ب, (Msb,) A dirhem, or piece
of money, done over with زئبق [i. e. quicksilver]:
(Lth, Mgh, Msb, TA:) the vulgar say مُزَبَّقٌ.
(S, Mgh.)
