زرب1
زَرْبٌ [as an inf. n.] signifies The constructing
a زَرِيبَة, (K, TA,) i. e. an enclosure of wood, (TA,)
for sheep, or goats: (K, TA:) you say, زَرَبْتُ
الغَنَمَ, aor. أَزْرُبُهَا, inf. n. زَرْبٌ: (TA:) [or this, I
think, is a mistake for what here follows:] زَرَبْتُ
لِلْغَنَمِ, aor. أَزْرُبُ, inf. n. زَرْبٌ (Ks, S:) [i. e. I constructed an enclosure of wood for the sheep or
goats: this meaning is plainly indicated, though
not expressed, in the S and TA:] but in some
copies of the K, in the place of بِنَآءُ الزَّرِيبَةِ لِلْغَنَمِ,
as explaining الزَّرْبُ, we find بنات الزريبة الغنم
[meaning that ↓ بَنَاتُ الزَّرِيبَةِ signifies sheep, or
goats]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And زَرَبَ البَهْمَ فِى زَرْبِهَا or
زَرِيبَتِهَا He put the بهم [i. e. lambs or kids, or young
lambs or kids,] into their place [or enclosure of
wood]. (A. [And the like is said in the Ham
p. 195.])
-A2-  زَرِبَ, aor.
زَرَبَ, (K, TA,) said of water,
(TA,) It flowed; (K, TA;) like سَرِبَ. (TA.)
7
انزرب البَهْمُ فِى الزَّرْبُ The بهم [i. e. lambs or
kids, or young lambs or kids,] entered into the
زرب [or enclosure of wood]. (A, TA. *) ―
-b2-  And
انزرب الصَّائِدُ (S, TA) فِى قُتْرَتِهِ (TA) (assumed tropical:)  The hunter,
or sportsman, entered into his lurking-place.
(S, TA.)
9
ازربّ, inf. n. اِزْرِبَابٌ, It (a plant, or herb,)
became yellow, or red, while having in it greenness. (K, TA.)
زَرْبٌ A place of entrance. (AA, S, A, K.) ―
-b2-
And hence, accord. to AA, (S,) the same word,
(S, A, K,) and ↓ زِرْبٌ, (ISk, S, K,) as some pronounce it, (ISk, S,) and ↓ زَرِيبَةٌ, (S, A, K,) (assumed tropical:)  The
place of sheep or goats; (A, K, TA;) [i. e.] an
enclosure of wood for sheep or goats: (S:) [said
in the TA to be tropical; but not so accord. to
the A:] pl. of the first (A, K) and second (K)
زُرُوبٌ, (A, K,) and of the last زَرَائِبُ. (A.) ―
-b3-
And, as being likened thereto, (A,) زَرْبٌ and
↓ زَرِيبَةٌ signify also (tropical:)  The lurking-place (قُتْرَة) of
a hunter, or sportsman, (S, A, K,) or of an
archer, or a shooter: (TA in explanation of the
former word:) both signify a well [or pit] which
the hunter, or sportsman, digs for himself that he
may lie in wait therein for the game. (TA.) ―
-b4-
See also the next paragraph.
زِرْبٌ: see the next preceding paragraph. ―
-b2-
Also A channel in which water flows; (K;) and
so ↓ زَرْبٌ. (TA.) It is said in a rejez of Kaab,
تَبِيتُ بَيْنَ الزِّرْبِ وَالكَنِيفِ
She passes the night between the channel of water
and the concealing, or protecting, place: meaning
that she is fed in the enclosures for camels &c.,
[فِى الحظائر, thus I read for الحضائر (an evident
mistranscription) in the TA,] and among the tents,
or houses; not in the pasture-land. (TA.)
زِرْبِىٌّ and زُرْبِىٌّ, (K,) or, accord. to the L [and
the A], on the authority of IAar, ↓ زَرْبِيَّةٌ, also said
to be written زِرْبِيَّةٌ and زُرْبِيَّةٌ, (TA,) are sings. of
↓ زَرَابِىُّ, (K, TA,) which signifies نَمَارِقُ [app. as
meaning Small pillows]: (S, A, K:) and carpets:
or any things which are spread, and upon which one
leans, or reclines: (A, K:) the like of this is said
by Zj in explaining a phrase in which it occurs in
the Kur lxxxviii. 16: or, accord. to Fr, it signifies carpets (طَنَافِس) having a fine nap, or pile:
(TA:) also, [particularly,] (A,) carpets (قُطُوع,
A, or طَنَافِس, Har p. 377) of the fabric of El-
Heereh; and the like thereof in fabric: (A, and
Har ubi suprà:) or ↓ زربيّة signifies [simply] a
carpet (طِنْفِسَةٌ): and a carpet (بِسَاط) having a
nap, or pile: and a [piece of leather that is
spread upon the ground, such as is called] نِطَع:
and the like thereof in make. (TA. [See also the
last sentence of this paragraph.]) [Hence,] one
says, البَغْضَآءِ بَيْنَهُمْ مَبْثُوثَةٌ ↓ زَرَابِىُّ (tropical:)  [The embellished
coverings of vehement hatred are spread between
them; i. e. vehement hatred concealed by fair
professions &c. subsists between them]. (A.) The
following saying, of Artáh Ibn-Suheiyeh,
وَنَحْنُ بَنُو عَمٍّ عَلَى ذَاتِ بَيْنِنَا
فِيهَا بِغْضَةٌ وَتَنافُسُ ↓ زَرَابِىُّ
is expl. by En-Nemiree as meaning (assumed tropical:)  [And we
are sons of a paternal uncle, but] upon our enmity
is a comely covering beneath which it is latent;
[therein are vehement hatred and envious competition;] زَرَابِىُّ signifying [properly] carpets of
sundry colours: (Ham p. 196:) it is also said to
mean, in this instance, (assumed tropical:)  [concealed] enmities, and
sayings that give pain; [the former of these two
meanings being] from زَرَبْتُ البَهْمَ فِى الزَّرِيبَةِ, i. e.
أَدْخَلْتُهُ: [the latter of them app. suggested by
another reading, namely, زَأَانِبُ in the place of
زَرَابِىُّ; mentioned and thus explained in the Ham
ubi suprà: the poet, therefore, is supposed to have
meant, upon our state of union, or concord, (ذات
بيننا having two contr. significations,) have supervened concealed enmities, &c.:] or, as some say,
the reading in the deewán of Artáh is زَرَائِبُ, as
though pl. of ↓ زَرِيبَةٌ, which is likewise made to
denote enmity because it is made to enter (تُزْرَبُ,
i. e. تُدْخَلُ,) into the heart; or which may be
metaphorically applied to a place of enmity latent
in the bosom, from the same word as signifying the
“ place in which are put lambs, or kids, and sheep,
or goats: ” or, supposing the right reading to be
↓ زَرَابِىُّ, the poet may very properly mean, upon
the vacant space between our tents, or houses, are
carpets (طَنَافِس and بُسُط) spread for us, and we
sit thereon, near together in the places, but with
the hearts remote: (idem p. 195:) but with the
reading زَأَانِبُ, mentioned above, occurs another
variation, thus: عَلَى ذَاكَ بَيْنَنَا زَأَانِبُ; meaning,
notwithstanding that, between us are sayings that
give pain. (Idem p. 196.) ―
-b2-  ↓ وَيْلٌ لِلزَّرْبِيَّةِ, occurring in a trad., is said to mean (tropical:)  Wo to those who
go in to lords, or princes, and, when they say
what is evil, or say anything, say, He has spoken
truth: such persons being likened, in respect of
their variable conduct, to one of the زَرَابِىّ mentioned above in the first sentence of this paragraph; or to sheep, or goats, which are thus
called in relation to the زَرْب, i. e. the enclosure to
which they repair, because they are obsequious to
the lords, or princes, and follow their steps with
the submissiveness of sheep or goats to their
pastor. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Accord. to El-Muärrij, (TA,)
↓ زَرَابِىُّ is applied to plants, as meaning Such as
have become yellow, or red, while having in them
greenness: (K, TA:) and when they saw the
colours in carpets and other articles of furniture
that are spread, they likened them to such plants.
(TA.)
زَرْبِيَّةٌ and زِرْبِيَّةٌ and زُرْبِيَّةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in three places. ―
-b2-  [Golius, finding the second and third of these words expl. by
the Pers. شادروان, (which is often applied by
Arabs in the present day to “ an artificial fountain
that throws up water,”) has erroneously, as Freytag has observed, supposed that they may signify
“ Euripus, fons in altum saliens. ”]
زَرِيبَةٌ: see زَرْبٌ, in two places: and see 1, first
sentence. ―
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The lurking-place of a beast
of prey. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  See also زِرْبِىٌّ.
زَرَابِىُّ: see زِرْبِىٌّ, in five places.
زِرْيَابٌ, (in the CK زِرْباب,) an arabicized word,
(K, TA,) from [the Pers.] زَرْ آبْ, the hemzeh [in
آبْ, for أَابْ,] being changed into ى, (TA,) Gold:
(IAar, K:) or the water thereof [i. e. water-gold;
which may be deemed the more correct, as agreeing with the original]. (K.) ―
-b2-  And Anything
yellow. (K.)
-A2-  Also A certain black singingbird; (MF, TA;) called also ابو زولق, [app. a
mistranscription for ابو زريق, as in Freytag's
Lex., i. e. أَبُو زُرَيْقٍ,] accord. to the book entitled
“ Mantik et-Teyr. ” (TA.)
مِزْرَابٌ i. q. مِرْزَابٌ [q. v., said to be not a chaste
word]. (K.)
مَزْرُبَانٌ: see مَرْزُبَانٌ, in art. رزب.
