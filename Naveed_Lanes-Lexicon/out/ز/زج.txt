of the hair thereof: or lengthened it [in appearance] with إِثْمِد [i. e. antimony, or ore of antimony, or a black collyrium; like as the ancient

from their paintings and sculptures; and like as
some of the Arab women still do; extending a
black line towards the ear, and also a similar line
from the outer angle of the eye]. (TA.) In the
following verse of the poet Er-Rá'ee,
إِذَا مَا الغَانِيَاتُ خَرَجْنَ يَوْمًا

shall lengthen (or lengthened) with black collyrium
the eyebrows and the eyes: or] كَحَلْنَ is meant

of the redundant portions of the hair of the eyebrows,” زجّج مَوْضِعَهَا, occurring in a trad., referring to a hole made in a piece of wood in
which a thousand deenars and a writing had been
inserted, is expl. as meaning He made even, and
adjusted, the place thereof: or, accord. to IAth,
it may be that the hole was in the end of the
piece of wood, and so it may mean he made a زُجّ
[q. v.] upon the place thereof, to hold it fast, and
to preserve what was in it. (TA.)

and with which one pierces, being called سِنَانٌ:

Msb, K) and [of pauc.] أَزْجَاجٌ and أَزِجَّةٌ, (TA,)
or this last is not allowable, (S, Msb, TA,) accord. to ISk. (Msb.) Zuheyr says,
وَمَنْ يَعْصِ أَطْرَافَ الزِّجَاجِ فَإِنَّهُ
يُطِيعُ العَوَالِى رُكِّبَتْ كُلَّ لَهْذَمِ
[And he who refuses to yield to the points of the
iron feet of the spears shall yield to the upper
extremities thereof mounted with every sharp
spear-head]: ISk says, he means that he who
refuses to yield to a small thing will encounter a
great thing: and Khálid Ibn-Kulthoom says,
they used to meet their enemies, when they
desired peace, with the iron feet of their spears
turned towards them; and if they refused peace,
they turned their spears' heads to them, and
combated them. (TA.) [By a synecdoche, the
pl.] زِجَاجٌ is also used to signify Spears, altogether. (Ham p. 147.) ―
