زغبرQ. 1
زَغْبَرَ It (a garment, or piece of cloth,)
had what is termed زِغْبِر, or زِغْبُر, &c., i. e. زِئْبِر [or
nap]. (O, K.)
زِغْبِرٌ, (O and TA, and so in a copy of the K,)
or زَغْبَرٌ, or زِغْبَرٌ, (as in two different copies of the
K,) and زِغْبُرٌ, (O and TA, and so accord. to a
copy of the K,) or زَغْبُرٌ, (accord. to another copy
of the K,) of a garment, or piece of cloth, i. q.
زِئْبِرٌ [i. e. The nap: see زِئْبِرٌ, in art. زبر]. (O, K.)
[Hence, app., supposing زَغْبَرٌ to be a dial. var.,
having the signification expl. above,] أَخَذَ الشَّىْءَ
بِزَغْبَرِهِ He took the thing altogether, (O, K, * TA,)
leaving nothing of it; as also بِزَأْبَرِهِ, and بِزَوْبَرِهِ.
(O, TA.)
