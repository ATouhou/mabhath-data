He, or it, (a thing, Msb,) declined, deviated,
swerved, or turned aside, (S, O, Msb, K,) from the
right course or direction, accord. to an explanation of زَيْغٌ by Er-Rághib; and from the truth:
(TA:) and زاغ, aor. يَزُوغُ, inf. n. زَوْغٌ, is a
dial. var. thereof. (Msb, TA. *) In the Kur iii. 5,
(O,) زَيْغٌ means A doubting, and a declining, or
deviating, from the truth. (O, K.) ―

زَاغَتِ الأَبْصَارُ signifies the eyes turned aside from
their places; as in the case of a man in fear. (TA.)

inf. n. إِزَاغَةٌ, (Msb,) He made him to decline,
deviate, swerve, or turn aside, (S, O, Msb, K,)

(O, TA,) meaning O our Lord, make us not [or
make not our hearts] to decline from the right
way and course: make us not to err, or go astray.
(TA. [See another reading in the first paragraph
of art. زوغ.]) ―

الزَّيْغ [app. as meaning deviation from the truth,

فَلَمَّا زَاغُوا أَزَاغَ اللّٰهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ, in the Kur [lxi. 5],

hearts from the acceptance of the truth, and the
inclining to the right course. (Bd.)

adorned, herself, and showed, or displayed, her
finery, or ornaments, and beauties of person or

تَزَايُغٌ i. q. تَمَايُلٌ, (JK, S, O, K,) An inclining

زَاغٌ [The rook;] a small غُرَاب [or bird of the
crow-kind], inclining to white, (O, Mgh, K, TA,)
that does not eat carrion, (O, Mgh, TA,) and is
allowed to be eaten; now called in Egypt the
غُرَاب نُوحِىّ [or Noachian crow]: (TA:) or a
غُرَاب like the pigeon, black, with a dusty colour
in its head; or, as some say, inclining to white;
that does not eat carrion: (Msb in art. زوغ:) or
a small black غُرَاب, that is eaten; also called
حَذَفٌ, of which the n. un. is with ة: (ISh, TA
in art. حذف:) [these descriptions correctly apply
to different varieties of the rook; some of which
are distinguished by more or less whiteness in the
head and other parts: in the present day, the
word is, by some, perhaps generally, erroneously
applied to the carrion-crow:] Az says, “I know
not whether it be Arabic or arabicized: ” (Msb
in art. زوغ, and TA:) the truth is, that it is a
Pers. word, [زَاغْ,] arabicized; originally applied
to crows (غِرْبَان), whether small or large; but when
arabicized, applied peculiarly to one species thereof:
(TA:) pl. زِيغَانٌ. (O, Mgh, Msb, K.)
زَائِغٌ Declining, deviating, swerving, or turning
aside: (TA:) pl. زَاغَةٌ, applied to a number of
men, (S, O, K, TA,) i. q. زَائِغُونَ, (S, O, TA,)
like بَاعَةٌ meaning بَائِغُونَ. (O, TA.)
