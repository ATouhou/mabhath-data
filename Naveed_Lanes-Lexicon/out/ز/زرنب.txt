زرنبزَرْنَبٌ A certain perfume: or certain sweetsmelling trees: (K:) or a species of sweet-smelling
plant: (S:) it consists of slender round twigs,
between [مَا بَيْنَ, misprinted ملين,] the thickness
of the large needle and the thickness of writingreeds, black inclining to yellowness, not having
much taste nor odour, its little odour being of a
fragrant kind like that of the citron: (Ibn-Seenà, book ii. p. 168:) [Freytag says, as on the
authority of the K, but he seems to have taken it
from the TK, that, “accord. to some, it signifies
the leaves of a sweet-smelling plant, which has the
name of رجل الجراد, locusts' foot: ” and he adds,
as though on the authority of Ibn-Seenà ubi suprá,
“ salix Aegyptiaca: ” referring also to Sprengel,
Hist. rei. herb., t. i. p. 270:] also saffron: (K:)
it is of the measure فَعْلَلٌ; (S, TA;) and is a
genuine Arabic word, though asserted by Ibn-El-Kutbee to be arabicized. (TA.) A rájiz says,
يَا بِأَبِى أَنْتِ وَفُوكِ الأَشْنَبُ
كَأَنَّمَا ذُرَّ عَلَيْهِ الزَّرْنَبُ
[O, with my father thou shouldst be ransomed,
and thy mouth that is cool and sweet, as though
زَرْنَب were sprinkled upon it]. (S.) In the trad.
of Umm-Zara, where it is said, المَسُّ مَسُّ أَرْنَبٍ
وَالرِّيحُ رِيحُ زَرْنَبٍ [The feel is the feel of a hare,
and the odour is the odour of زَرْنَب], IAth says
that it signifies saffron; and she may mean the
sweetness of his odour, or the perfume of his
garments among the people. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also The
[dung such as is termed] بَعْر of wild animals.
(K.)
-A2-  Also, [and, as appears from what follows,
↓ زَرْنَبَةٌ likewise, if this be not a mistranscription,]
The vulva of a woman: (K, * TA:) or such as is
large: or the external portion thereof: (K:) or
a piece of flesh (K, TA) within the زروان [a mistranscription for زَرَدَان, a name for the vulva],
(TA,) behind the كَيْنَة [or كَيْن, q. v.]: (K, TA:)
behind the ↓ زَرْنَبَة is another piece of flesh: so
says IAar. (TA.)
زَرْنَبَةٌ: see the next preceding sentence, in two
places.
