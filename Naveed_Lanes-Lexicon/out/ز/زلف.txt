زَلَفَ: see 2:
-A2-  and see also 8, in three places.
2
زلّفهُ, (O, TA,) inf. n. تَزْلِيفٌ, (O,) He did it
previously, or beforehand; namely, a thing;
(IAar, O, TA;) as, for instance, an evil action;
(O, TA;) and so ↓ زَلَفَهُ; (IAar, TA;) syn. أَسْلَفَهُ,
(O, TA,) and قَدَّمَهُ. (IAar, O, TA.) ―
-b2-  زلّف
النَّاسَ, inf. n. as above, He disquieted, or agitated,
the people, step by step: (Ibn-'Abbád, Z, O, TA:)
accord. to Z, said of a guide. (TA.) ―
-b3-  زلّف فِى
حَدِيثِهِ, (inf. n. as above, K,) He added, or exaggerated, in his discourse, or narration; (IDrd,
O, K;) as also ذرّف. (IDrd, O.)
4
ازلفهُ He made, brought, or drew, him, or it,
(namely, a thing, TA,) near. (S, Mgh, Msb, TA.)
Hence, in the Kur [xxvi. 90 and 1. 30], وَأُزْلِفَتِ
الْجَنَّةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ And Paradise shall be brought
near to the pious: meaning, accord. to Zj, that
their entrance thereinto shall become near, and
their view thereof. (TA.) [بِهِ ↓ ازدلف also signifies the same as ازلفه (agreeably with analogy);
as is shown by what here follows:] it is said in a
trad. of Mohammad El-Bákir, مَا لَكَ مِنْ عَيْشِكَ إِلَّا
لَذَّةٌ تَزْدَلِفُ بِكَ إِلَى حِمَامِكَ [i. e. There is not remaining to thee, of thy life, save a pleasure that
brings thee near to thy predestined term]. (O,
TA.) And ↓ ازدلفهُ means He, or it, brought him
near to destruction. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also He collected
it together; (Msb, TA;) namely, a thing. (Msb.)
Hence, in the Kur [xxvi. 64], وَأَزْلَفْنَا ثَمَّ الآخَرِينَ
[And we collected there the others]. (TA.)

تَزَلَّفَ see the next paragraph.
8
اِزْدَلَفَ, (Mgh, Msb,) originally اِزْتَلَفَ, (Msb,)
or اِزْدَلَفُوا, and ↓ تزلّفوا, (S, O, L, K,) He, or they,
approached, or drew near: (Mgh, O, L, Msb,
TA: in the K, تَفَرَّقُوا is erroneously put for تَقَرَّبُوا:
TA:) or (O, accord. to the K “ and ”) advanced;
or went forward, or before: (S, O, K:) إِلَيْهِ [to
him, or it], (Mgh, K,) and مِنْهُ [which means the
same, as after دَنَا &c.]: (TA, and Har p. 452:)
[and ↓ زَلَفَ and زَلَفُوا, inf. n. app. زَلْفٌ and زَلَفٌ,
signify the same: for] you say also, إِلَيْهِ ↓ زَلَفَ
He drew near to him, or it: and لَهُ ↓ زَلَفْنَا We
advanced, or went forward, to him, or it: (TA:)
and زَلْفٌ signifies the act of advancing, or going
forward, (A'Obeyd, S, TA,) from place to place;
as also زَلَفٌ. (TA.) One says, ازدلف السَّهْمُ إِلَى
كَذَا The arrow approached, or drew near, to
such a thing. (Msb.) And it is said in a trad.,
فَإِذَا زَالَتِ الشَّمْسُ فَاْزْدَلِفْ إِلَى اللّٰهِ فِيهِ بِرَكْعَتَيْنِ,
meaning تَقَرَّبْ [i. e., When the sun declines from
the meridian, then seek thou to draw near unto
God therein by means of the prayers of two
rek'ahs]. (TA.)
-A2-  See also 4, in two places.
زَلْفٌ: see زُلْفَةٌ.
زُلْفٌ: see its accus. case voce زُلْفَةٌ, near the end
of the paragraph.
زِلْفٌ A meadow; syn. رَوْضَةٌ; (TS, K;) and so
↓ زَلَفَةٌ: (IB, TA:) thus the latter is expl. as occurring in a trad. relating to Ya-jooj and Ma-jooj,
in which it is said, ثُمَّ يُرْسِلُ اللّٰهُ مَطَرًا فَيَغْسِلُ الأَرْضَ
حَتَّى يَتْرُكَهَا كَالزَّلَفَةِ [Then God will send rain,
and it will wash the earth so that it will leave
it like the meadow]: but in this instance, several
other meanings are assigned to it: see زَلَفَةٌ below.
(TA.)
زَلَفٌ: see زُلْفَةٌ, in two places:
-A2-  and see also
زَلَفَةٌ, in five places.
زُلُفٌ: see its accus. case voce زُلْفَةٌ, near the end
of the paragraph.
زُلْفَةٌ i. q. قُرْبَةٌ [i. e. Nearness, with respect to
rank, degree, or station]; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;)
as also ↓ زُلْفَى, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,) and ↓ زَلَفٌ.
(IDrd, O, K.) [It would seem that it means also
Nearness with respect to place or situation: for
SM immediately adds,] hence, in the Kur [lxvii. 27],
فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ زُلْفَةً, [as though meaning But when they
shall see it in a state of nearness: but] Zj says
that the meaning is, but when they shall see it
(i. e. the punishment) near (قَرِيبًا): and several
authors say that زُلْفَةٌ is sometimes used in the
sense of قَرِيبٌ, as is stated in the 'Ináyeh. (TA.)
And Station, rank, grade, or degree; as also
↓ زُلْفَى, (S, O, K, TA,) and ↓ زَلْفٌ, (TS, K,) and
↓ زَلَفٌ: (K, TA:) pl. of the first زُلَفٌ: (S, * TA:)
or (K) ↓ زُلْفَى is a quasi-inf. n.; (S, K;) and such
it is in the saying in the Kur [xxxiv. 36], وَمَا
أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَلَا أَوْلَادُكُمْ بِالَّتِى تُقَرِّبُكُمْ عِنْدِنَا زُلْفَى, as
though meaning ازْدِلَافًا [i. e. And neither your
riches nor your children are what will bring you
near to us in advancement: but here it may be
well rendered, in station]: (S:) accord. to Ibn-
'Arafeh, زُلْفَى signifies the bringing very near:
(TA:) the saying of Ibn-El-Tilimsánee that it is
pl. of زُلْفَةٌ is very strange, and unknown; the
correct pl. of this last word being زُلَفٌ. (MF,
TA.) ―
-b2-  Also A portion (S, K) of the first part
(S) of the night, (S, K,) whether small or large:
so accord. to Th: or, accord. to Akh, of the
night absolutely: (TA:) pl. زُلَفٌ and زُلَفَاتٌ (S, K)
and زُلُفَاتٌ and زُلْفَاتٌ: or زُلَفٌ signifies the hours,
or periods, (سَاعَات,) of the night, commencing
from the daytime, and the hours, or periods, of
the daytime, commencing from the night: (K:)
and its sing. is زُلْفَةٌ. (TA.) وَزُلَفًا مِنَ اللَّيْلِ, in
the Kur [xi. 116], means And at sunset and nightfall (the مَغْرِب and the عِشَآء): (Zj, TA:) some
read ↓ زُلُفًا, with two dammehs; which may be a
sing., like حُلُمٌ; or a pl. of زُلْفَةٌ, like as بُسُرٌ is of
بُسُرَةٌ, with damm to the س in each: [but this is
not a parallel instance; for بُسُرٌ is a coll. gen. n.
of which بُسُرَةٌ is the n. un., and the latter is not
of the same measure as زُلْفَةٌ:] and some read
↓ زُلْفًا, which is a pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.] of
زُلْفَةٌ, like as دُرٌّ is of دُرَّةٌ; (K, TA;) or pl. of
↓ زَلِيفٌ, like as قُرْبٌ is of قَرِيبٌ, and غُرْبٌ of
غَرِيبٌ: (TA:) and some read ↓ زُلْفَى, in which
the alif [written ى] is a denotative of the fem.
gender. (K, TA.)
-A2-  See also the next paragraph.
زَلَفَةٌ A full [reservoir of water such as is called]
مَصْنَعَة: (S, K:) pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]
↓ زَلَفٌ: (S:) so, accord. to Sh, in the trad. mentioned voce زِلْفٌ: (TA:) or ↓ زَلَفٌ signifies full
watering-troughs, (K,) as pl. [or coll. gen. n.] of
زَلَفَةٌ: (TA:) or a full watering-trough. (K.)
Also A [bowl such as is called] صَحْفَة: (K;) and
so ↓ زُلْفَةٌ; (Ibn-'Abbád, K;) of which the pl. is
زُلَفٌ: (TA:) or a full صَحْفَة; and its pl. [or coll.
gen. n.] is ↓ زَلَفٌ. (Lth, TA.) Also A green
[vessel of the kind called] إِجَّانَة: (K:) so says
AO: pl. [or coll. gen. n.] ↓ زَلَفٌ; and ↓ مَزَالِفُ
likewise signifies green أَجَاجِين [app. as an anomalous pl. of زَلَفَةٌ or of زَلَفٌ, like as مَشَابِهُ is of
شَبَهٌ]; both, also, mentioned on the authority of
AO. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also A mother-of-pearl-'shell, or
an oyster-shell; syn. صَدَفَةٌ: (K:) Kt says that
الزَّلَفَة in the trad. mentioned above voce زِلْفٌ has
been expl. as meaning the مَحَارَة, i. e. the صَدَفَة;
but he adds, I know not this explanation, unless a
pool of water be called محارة because the water
returns (يَحُورُ) to it and collects in it. (TA.) ―
-b3-
Also A smooth rock: (K:) so, too, said to mean
in the same trad.: and some read الزلقة. (TA.)
And Rugged ground. (K.) And Swept ground.
(K.) And An even part of a soft mountain. (K.)
Pl. (K) [or rather coll. gen. n.] in all these senses
(TA) ↓ زَلَفٌ. (K.) ―
-b4-  See also زِلْفٌ. ―
-b5-  Also A
mirror: (O, K: [in the CK, المَرْأَةُ is put in the
place of المِرْآةُ:]) [like زَلَقَةٌ:] mentioned by IB
on the authority of Aboo-'Amr Ez-Záhid, and by
Sgh on that of Ks: and so, too, it is said to mean
in the trad. mentioned above; the earth being
likened thereto because of its evenness and cleanness: (TA:) or the face thereof; (K;) as is said
by IAar. (TA.)
زُلْفَى: see زُلْفَةٌ, in four places.
عُقْبَةٌ زَلُوفٌ [A stage of a journey] far-extend-
ing: (O, K:) so says IF. (O.) [In the CK,
عَقَبَةٌ is erroneously put for عُقْبَةٌ.]
زَلِيفٌ Advancing; or going forward, or before.
(O, K. [It is said in the TA that المُتَقَدِّمُ as the
explanation of الزَّلِيفُ is erroneously put in the
copies of the K for التَّقَدُّمُ: but this assertion is
app. itself erroneous.]) See زُلْفَةٌ, near the end of
the paragraph.
[
أَزْلَفُ expl. by Golius as on the authority of the
KL, and by Freytag after him, as meaning Parvo
naso præditus ejusque recto ac parvo mucrone, is
a mistake for أَذْلَفُ, thus written in my copy of
the KL.]
[
أَزْلَفَةٌ and أَزْلَفَى expl. by Freytag as meaning
Copia parva, cœtus hominum parvus, as on the
authority of El-Meydánee, are app. mistakes for
أَزْفَلَةٌ and أَزْفَلَى.]
مَزْلَفَةٌ Any town (قَرْيَةٌ) that is between the desert
and the cultivated land: pl. مَزَالِفُ: (S, * K:)
the latter is syn. with بَرَاغِيلُ, signifying the towns
(بِلَاد) that are between the cultivated land and
the desert; (S;) or, between the desert and the
بَحْر [i.e. sea or great river]; such as El-Ambár
and El-Kádiseeyeh. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-  [The pl.] مَزَالِفُ
also signifies Places of ascent; or steps, or stairs,
by which one ascends: (K:) because they bring
one near to the place to which he ascends. (TA.)
-A2-  For the pl. مَزَالِفُ, see also زَلَفَةٌ.
