or the thong to which the شِسْع is attached, or
tied: the شِسْع being the thong that passes through
the sole, and between two of the toes, and to which

others the شِرَاك, extending between the leg and the
toes: and by some, to what is called by others the
شِسْع, or قِبَال: to the latter as being likened to
the cord that is tied to the camel's nose-ring; and
to the former as being likened to the leading-rope
which is tied to that cord: it being] a metaphorical
term, from the زِمَام of the camel: (Mgh:) it is
[said to be] the thong lies upon the back
[meaning upper side] of the foot, [extending]
from, or [consisting] of, the fore part of the
شِرَاك, lengthwise: [for the term شِرَاك (q. v.) is
sometimes used in a larger sense than that above
assigned to it:] or it is like the قِبَال, [which is
expl. in the same manner as the شِسْع, i. e., as]
being between the middle toe and that next to it:
(Har p. 539:) [and thus it is expl. by J and Mtr

its زِمَام, (S, and Mgh and K in art. قبل,) i. e.
