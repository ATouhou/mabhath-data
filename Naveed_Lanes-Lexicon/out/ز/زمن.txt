عَامَلَهُ مُزَامَنَةً (S, K) and زِمَانًا (Lh, TA) [He
bargained, or made an engagement, with him, to
work, for a time], (S, K,) from الزَّمَنُ. (S,) is
like مُشَاهَرَةً [and شِهَارًا] (S, K) from الشَّهْرُ. (S.)
4
ازمن [He, or it, continued a long time;] a
long time passed over him, or it, (K, * TA,) i. e.
a thing. (TA.) You say, ازمن بِالمَكَانِ He remained, staid, dwelt, or abode, a long time (زَمَانًا)
in the place. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And [hence,] ازمن عَنِّى
عَطَاؤُهُ (tropical:)  His gift [was a long time kept back from
me, or] was slow, or tardy, in coming to me.
(TA.)
-A2-  ازمن فُلَانًا He (God) made such a one
to be such as is termed زَمِن, i. e. affected with a
protracted disease; (Msb, TA;) or crippled, or
deprived of the power to move or to stand or to
walk, by disease, or by a protracted disease: or
made him to be affected with what is termed
[زَمَانَةٌ, expl. below, as meaning] عَاهَةٌ [&c.].
(TA.) It is said also of a disease [as meaning It
deprived him of the power to move &c.]. (TA in
art. عضب.)
زَمَنٌ an inf. n. of زَمِنَ [q. v.]. (Msb, K.) ―
-b2-
And a simple subst. [meaning Continuance for a
long time,] from أَزْمَنَ in the first of the senses
assigned to it above; and so ↓ زُمْنَةٌ, with damm.
(IAar, TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, and ↓ زَمَانٌ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,)
the former a contraction of the latter, (Msb,) A
time, whether little or much; (S, Msb, K;) thus
accord. to Er-Rághib; (TA in art. دهر;) as being
a space capable of division: (Msb:) and so says
El-Munáwee: (TA:) a time considered with
respect to its beginning and its end: (Er-Rághib,
MF voce أَمَدٌ:) or i. q. عَصْرٌ [as meaning a space,
or period, of time]: (M, K:) [often meaning,
without any addition to qualify it, a long time;
as in an instance of the usage of the latter word
above: (see 4:) what follows here applies to each
of these words:] زَمَانٌ differs in some respects
from آنٌ and from أَمَدٌ: Sh asserts it to be syn.
with دَهْرٌ; but AHeyth says that this is a mistake:
(TA:) [it is so, however, sometimes, accord. to
several authorities, as has been shown in art. دهر;
and particularly as meaning fortune, or fate:]
IAth says that it is applied to the whole of what
is termed الدَّهْرُ [as meaning time], and to a
portion thereof: AHeyth says that it is the زمان
[i. e. season] of fruit, of ripe dates, and of heat
and cold: and that it may be [a period of] two
months [as meaning any one of the six seasons of
the solar year] to six months [as meaning the
half-year often termed summer and the half-year
often termed winter]: (TA:) [thus] it is applied
to any one of the four quarters of the year;
(Msb, TA;) the first of which [in the order in
which they are commonly mentioned by the
Arabs, i. e. autumn,] is called by the Arabs [of
the classical age] الرَّبِيعُ, but vulgarly الخَرِيفُ;
called by the former name because the first rain
is therein, giving growth to [the herbage called]
the رَبِيع; and called by the latter name because
the fruits are gathered therein; and it commences
when the sun enters Libra: the second [i. e.
winter] is called الشِّتَآءُ; and commences when the
sun enters Capricornus: the third [i. e. spring] is
الصَّيْفُ, vulgarly called الرَّبِيعُ; and commences
when the sun enters Aries: the fourth [i. e.
summer] is القَيْظُ, vulgarly called الصَّيْفُ; and
commences when the sun enters Cancer: (Msb:) *
* The two following tables exhibit the principal
divisions of the Arabian Calendar. The latter of
them shows the places of the months in relation
to the solar year at the period when they received
the names by which they are here designated.

it is also applied to the time, or period, of the
reign, rule, prefecture, or the like, of a man:
[and to the life-time of a man:] with the philosophers, it signifies the measure of the motion of
the ninth (or greatest) sphere (الفَلَك الأَطْلَس):
(TA:) [and there are various other explanations
belonging to the conventional language of the
schools, not to the proper language of the Arabs:
(see the “ Dict. of the Technical Terms used in the
Sciences of the Musalmans: ”)] the pl. (of زَمَنٌ,
Msb) is أَزْمَانٌ and أَزْمُنٌ and (that of زَمَانٌ, Msb)
أَزْمِنَةٌ. (S, Msb, K.) [The dim. of زَمَنٌ, i. e. زُمَيْنٌ,
see below.] In the following trad., إِذَا تَقَارَبَ
لَمْ تَكَدْ رُؤيَا المُؤْمِنِ تَكْذِبُ ↓ الزَّمَانُ [When the time
becomes contracted, the dream of the believer will
scarcely ever, or never, be false], what is meant
is the end of time; and the approach of the resurrection; because when a thing becomes little,
its extremities contract: or what is meant is the
day's and the night's becoming equal; for the
interpreters of dreams assert that the times [of
dreams] most true of interpretation are the season
of the breaking forth of the blossoms and that of
the ripening of the fruit, which is when the day
and the night become equal: or what is meant is
the coming forth of El-Mahdee, when the year
will be like the month, and the month like the
week, and the week like the day, and the day
like the hour, deemed short because deemed
delightful: (K in art. قرب:) or it alludes to the
shortness of lives and the scantiness of blessings.
(TA in that art.) In another trad. it is said,
كَانَتْ تَأْتِينَا أَزْمَانَ خَدِيجَةَ, meaning [She used to
come to us] in the life-time [lit. times] of Khadeejeh. (TA.) And one says also, مَا لَقِيتُهُ مُذْ
↓ زَمَنَةٍ, meaning ↓ مذ زَمَانٍ [i. e. I have not met
him for a long time past: but in this case, accord.
to the more approved usage, one should say مُذْ
زَمَنَةٌ and مُذْ زَمَانٌ, or مُنْذُ زَمَنَةٍ and مُنْذُ زَمَانٍ].
(Lh, K, * TA.)
(For authorities, and further information, see the
words here mentioned, and more particularly نَوْءٌ
and رَبِيعٌ; under the latter of which it is said that
the third and last of the Six Seasons are called by
some, respectively, الرَّبِيعُ الثَّانِى and الرَّبِيعُ الأَوَّلُ;
and also that the appellations of the 3rd and 4th
months are differently pronounced by different
persons; and that some exclude the وَسْمِىّ from
the rains called الرَّبِيعُ: and for the Calendar of
the Mansions of the Moon, see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in
art. نزل.) The months are said to have received
the names here given to them from Kiláb Ibn-Murrah, an ancestor of Mohammad, about two
centuries before El-Islám. These months were
lunar; and from this period, with the view of
adapting their year to the solar, the Arabs added
a month, which they called النَّسِىْءُ, at the end of
every three years, until they were forbidden to do
so by the Kur-án (ch. ix.): but the months still
retrograded through the seasons, though much
more slowly. The abolition of the intercalation
was proclaimed by Mohammad at the pilgrimage
in the tenth year of the Flight.
زَمِنٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ زَمِينٌ, (K, TA,)

[expl. below], i. e. عَاهَةٌ: (K, TA:) or afflicted
[with what is so termed]: (S:) pl. زَمِنُونَ, (K,
TA,) of the former, (TA,) and زَمْنَى, (Msb, K,
TA,) [likewise] of the former, (Msb,) or of the
latter, as also زَمَنَةٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] هُوَ فَاتِرُ

briskness or promptness, powerless in respect of
desire]. (TA.)
زُمْنَةٌ: see زَمَنٌ, second sentence.
زَمَنَةٌ A space, or period, or a long space or

زُمَيْنٌ [dim. of زَمَنٌ]. You say, لَقِيتُهُ ذَاتَ الزُّمَيْنِ,
meaning thereby تَرَاخِى الوَقْتِ; (S, K;) [i. e.
I met him some time ago;] like as one says
ذَاتَ العُوَيْمِ, meaning بَيْنَ الأَعْوَامِ: (S:) or meaning فِى سَاعَةٍ لَهَا أَعْدَادٌ [in a time consisting of
some, or several, subdivisions]: (TA:) or ذَاتَ
الزُّمَيْنِ means مُذْ ثَلَاثَةٌ أَزْمَانٍ [three seasons ago;
or, app., three or more, to ten; (agreeably with
an explanation of ذَاتَ العُوَيْمِ voce ذُو;) by ازمان
being app. meant periods of two, or three, or six,
months]; (T in art. ذُو;) and the like is said by
IAar. (TA in art. صبح.)
زَمَانَةٌ an inf. n. of زَمِنَ [q. v.]. (S, * Msb, K.) ―
-b2-
[Used as a simple subst.] it signifies also A
disease, or an evil affection, syn. آفَةٌ, (S,) or عَاهَةٌ,
(K,) in animals: (S:) [and particularly, in a
man, a disease of long continuance: or such as
cripples, or deprives of the power to move or to
stand or to walk: (see زَمِنَ and زَمِنٌ:)] or want
of some one or more of the limbs, or members;
and privation of the powers, or faculties. (Har
p. 315.) And i. q. دَهْرٌ [app. as meaning An evil
event or accident, a misfortune, or a calamity].

over which a long time has past. (TA.) [You
