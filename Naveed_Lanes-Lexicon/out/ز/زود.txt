laid in a stock of provisions for travelling or for
a fixed residence; syn. أَسَّسَ زَادًا: (L, K:) or

المَزَاوِدِ [He furnished them with what filled the
provision-bags for travelling-provision]: (A:)
and زوّدهُ الزَّيْتُ [He furnished him with olive-oil
for travelling-provision]. (S in art. زيت.) And

تزوّد [He became furnished, or he furnished
himself, with provisions for travelling or for a
fixed residence;] he took, or prepared, for himself provisions (S, * KL, TA) for travelling or for
a fixed residence: (TA: [Golius makes it to be
trans. by means of بِ as on the authority of the
KL; in which the only explanation, as that of
the inf. n., is توشه برگرفتن:]) and he chose a
thing as زَاد [or provision] for himself. (Har p.
92.) You say, تَزَوَّدَ مِنَّا فُلَانٌ [Such a one was
furnished, or such a one furnished himself, with
provisions from us]. (A.) And تزوّد لِسَفَرِهِ [He
was furnished, or he furnished himself, with
provisions for his journey]. (Msb.) And see
another ex. voce زَادٌ. You say also, تَزَوَّدَ مِنَ
الدُّنْيَا لِلْآخِرَةِ (tropical:)  [Take thou provisions from the
present world, i. e. make thou provision in it,
for the world to come]. (A, TA.) And تَزَوَّدَ
مِنَ الأَمِيرِ كِتَابًا لِعَامِلِهِ (tropical:)  [He provided himself
with a letter from the commander, or governor,
or prince, to his prefect]. (A, TA.) And تَزَوَّدَ
مِنِّى طَعْنَةً بَيْنَ أُذُنَيْهِ (tropical:)  [He got from me a stab,
or spear-wound, or the like, between his ears].
(A, TA.)
زَادٌ Provisions, or a stock of provisions, for
travelling (S, L, Msb, TA) and for a fixed residence: (L, TA:) pl. أَزْوَادٌ (L, Msb) and أَزْوِدَةٌ;
the latter anomalous. (L.) ―
-b2-  And hence, as
being likened thereto, (tropical:)  Any deed, or acquirement,
whether good or evil, whereby one becomes changed
in state, or condition; (L;) [or rather, whereby
one provides for a change of state, or condition,
like as a traveller provides for a journey.] It is
said in the Kur [ii. 193], فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ ↓ وَتَزَوَّدُوا
التَّقْوَى (L) meaning, [as is implied in the L,
(tropical:)  And make ye provision; but verily the best
acquirement whereby to provide for a change of
state, or condition, is fear of God, or piety: or
the meaning is] and prepare ye provisions for
your journey; and verily the best provision is
that whereby one provides against begging from
others, &c. (Jel.) ―
-b3-  [It is also said to be used
as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Salutation and the returning of a
greeting. (De Sacy's Chrest. Ar., ii. 415, q. v.)]
مَزَادٌ: see مَزَادَةٌ.
مِزْوَدٌ A bag, or other receptacle, (S, * Msb, K,
TA,) for travelling-provisions, (S, K, TA,) or
for dates, made of leather: (Msb:) pl. مَزَاوِدُ.
(S, A, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] رِقَابُ المَزَاوِدِ [lit.
The necks of provision-bags;] a nickname applied
to the عَجَم [or Persians, or foreigners in general,]
(S, K) by the Arabs. (S.) [See art. رقب.]
مَزَادَةٌ [A leathern water-bag, one of a pair
which is borne by a camel or other beast;;] the
half (شَطْر) of a رَاوِيَة: pl. مَزَائِدُ; [regularly مَزَاوِدُ;
or the medial radical is ى and therefore the reg. pl.
is مَزَايِدُ;] and sometimes they said ↓ مَزَادٌ, [a
coll. gen. n.,] without ة: [accord. to some,] it is
of the measure مَفْعَلَةٌ, [originally مَزْوَدَةٌ,] from
الزَّادُ, because one furnishes himself with water in
it for travelling-provision: (Msb:) [and therefore
it is mentioned in this art.:] but this is a mistake.
(TA in art. زيد, q. v.)
