spear, (A,) and spears, (A, K,) so called in relation to a certain man named Zá'ib (زَاعِبٌ),
(A, K,) of El-Khazraj, who made spear-heads:
(A:) so says Mbr: (TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  the spears thus
termed are such as quiver much (عَسَّالَةٌ), which,
when shaken, have a motion like the torrent
termed زَاعِبٌ, of which one portion impels another:
the ى being that of the rel. n.; to give intensiveness to the signification, as in أَحْمَرِىٌّ: (A:) or
(tropical:) such that, when they are shaken, their كُعُوب
[i. e. knots, or joints, or their internodal portions,]
are as though they ran one into another, (K,
TA,) by reason of its pliancy: so says As: and
this meaning is tropical; for it is from the phrase
مَرَّ يَزْعَبُ بِحِمْلِهِ meaning “ he went along [impelled by his load, or] easily with his load: ”
accord. to another explanation, زاعبىّ applied to a
spear means such that, when it is shaken, the whole
of it is [in appearance] impelled in its several
parts by the impetus of one part acting upon
another, as though its hind part ran into its fore
part: (TA:) or زَاعِبِيَّةٌ signifies spears, (S, TA,)
universally. (TA.) You say also سِنَانٌ زَاعِبِىٌّ
(S, TA) A spear-head of Zá'ib. (TA.)
مُزْلَعِبٌّ: see زَاعِبٌ; and see also art. زلعب.
