زمرذزُمُرُّذٌ (T, S, Mgh, L, Msb, K) and زُمُرَّذٌ, (Az,
TA,) and accord. to some زُمُرُّدٌ, with the unpointed د (TA,) or, accord. to IKt, this is a
mistranscription, and As says that it is correctly
written with the pointed ذ (Msb,) [The emerald:
accord. to some] i. q. زَبَرْجَدٌ; (Sudot;, L, Msb, K;)
but Et-Teyfáshee [rightly] says that the زبرجد is
a different kind of stone: [see this word:] and
Ibn-Sá'id El-Ansáree says that the mine of the
زبرجد is said to be near to that of the زمّرذ:
(TA:) several authors say that the زمّرذ differs
from the زبرجد in being more green: (MF,
TA:) it is an arabicized word [from the Pers.
زُمْرُدْ]: (S, L, Msb, K:) [a coll. gen. n.:] n. un.
with ة. (Msb.)
