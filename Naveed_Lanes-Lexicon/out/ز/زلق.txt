زلق1
زَلِقَ, aor.
زَلَقَ, (K,) inf. n. زَلَقٌ; (TA;) and
زَلَقَ, aor.
زَلُقَ, (K,) inf. n. زَلْقٌ; (TA;) He slipped;
syn. زَلَّ; (K, TA;) for which ذَلَّ is erroneously
put in [some of] the copies of the K. (TA. [See
also 5.]) And زَلِقَتْ رِجْلُهُ, (S,) or القَدَمُ, (Msb,)
aor.
زَلَقَ, inf. n. زَلَقٌ, (S, Msb,) His foot, (S,) or
the foot, (Msb,) slipped, (S,) or did not remain
firm, or fixed, in its place. (Msb.) The former
is also said of an arrow, [app. as meaning It slid
along the ground,] like زَهِقَ [q. v.]. (JK in art.
زهق.) ―
-b2-  زَلِقَ بِمَكَانِهِ and زَلَقَ, He was, or became,
disgusted by, or with, his place, or he loathed it,
and removed, withdrew, or retired to a distance,
from it. (K, TA.) ―
-b3-  زَلَقَتْ, said of a she-camel,
She was, or became, quick, or swift. (O, TA.)
-A2-  زَلَقَهُ: see 4. ―
-b2-  زَلَقَهُ عَنْ مَكَانِهِ, aor.
زَلِقَ, (K,)
inf. n. زَلْقٌ, (TA,) He removed him from his
place. (K, TA.) Hence the reading of Aboo-Jaafar and Náfi', [in the Kur lxviii. 51,] وَإِنْ
يَكَادُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَيَزْلِقُونَكَ بِأَبْصَارِهِمْ, meaning
[And verily they who have disbelieved almost]
smite thee with their evil eyes so as to remove
thee from thy station in which God has placed
thee, by reason of enmity to thee. (TA. [Or
this reading may be rendered agreeably with the
common reading: see 4.]) ―
-b3-  زَلَقَ رَأْسَهُ, (S, K,)
aor.
زَلِقَ, inf. n. زَلْقٌ, (S,) He shaved his head; as
also ↓ ازلقهُ; and ↓ زلّقهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَزْلِيقٌ: (S:)
IB says that, accord. to 'Alee Ibn-Hamzeh, it is
only زَبَقَهُ, with ب; and that الزَّبْقُ means the
plucking out; not the shaving: but accord. to
Fr, one says of him who has shaved his head قد
زلقه, [whether with or without teshdeed is not
shown,] and ازلقه. (TA.)
2
زلّق, [inf. n. تَزْلِيقٌ,] He made a place slippery, (K, TA,) so that it became like the مَزْلَقَة;
and thus too though there be no water therein.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Accord. to the O and K, [the inf. n.]
تَزْلِيقٌ also signifies The anointing the body with
oils and the like, so that it becomes like the مَزْلَقَة;
to which is added in the O, and though it be
without water: but this is a confusion of two
meanings; one of which is the first expl. above in
this paragraph; and the other is, the anointing
the body with oils and the like; as in the L and
the Tekmileh. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See also 4. ―
-b4-  And see
1, last sentence. ―
-b5-  زلّق الحَدِيدَةَ He made the
iron thing to be always sharp. (K.) ―
-b6-  رلّقهُ بِبَصَرِهِ,
inf. n. as above, He looked sharply, or intently,
at him, or it. (Ez-Zejjájee, TA.) ―
-b7-  See also 2,
last sentence, in art. دلص.

ازلقهُ He made him to slip; as also ↓ زَلَقَهُ.

الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَيُزْلِقُونَكَ بِأَبْصَارِهِمْ, meaning [And
verily those who have disbelieved] almost make
thee to fall by their looking hard at thee, with
vehement hatred: so accord. to El-'Otbee: or the
meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  [almost] smite thee with their [evil]
eyes: (TA:) [it is also said that] ازلق فُلَانًا بِبَصَرِهِ
means (tropical:)  he looked at such a one with the look of a
person affected with displeasure, or anger: (K:)
or so نَظَرَ إِلَى فُلَانٍ فَأَزْلَقَهُ بِبَصَرِهِ: (Jm, TA:) and
in this sense, also, is expl. the saying in the Kur
mentioned above. (TA.) One says also ازلق
رِجْلَهُ, (S,) or القَدَمَ, (Msb,) He made his
(another's) foot to slip, (S,) or he made the foot
not to remain firm, or fixed, in its place; and so
↓ زَلَّقَهَا. (Msb.) ―

TA,) and of a mare, (TA,) She cast her young
one; syn. أَسْقَطَتْ; (S, TA;) or أَجْهَضَتْ [q. v.]:
(K:) or she (a mare) cast forth her young one
completely formed: or, as some say, [her fœtus]
not completely formed: (JK:) and you say also,
ازلقت بِجَنِينِهَا, like أَمْلَصَتْ به [q. v.]: (Abu-l-
'Abbás, TA in art. ملص:) or ازلقت وَلَدَهَا is said
of a female [of any kind], and means she cast
forth her young one before it was completely
formed. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  See also 1, last sentence.

[The ganglion slipped about between the skin and
the flesh]. (M in art. ديص.) ―
-b2-  [Also It was, or
became, smooth, or slippery: a signification indicated in the M, in art. ملس, where it is coupled

فَمَنْ عَلَا زَلَقًا عَنْ غِرَّةٍ زَلَجَا
[Appoint for thy foot, before the stepping, its
