زأنزِئْنِىٌّ, applied to a dog, Short: (S, K:) one
should not say صِينِىٌّ. (S.)
زُؤَانٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and زُوَانٌ (M, Msb) and
زِئَانٌ (M, K) and زِوَانٌ (M, Msb) and زَآنٌ (K)
and زَوَانٌ, (K in art. زون, q. v.,) but the like of
سَحَابٌ is said by ISd to be a form not seen by
him on the authority of anyone, (TA,) [A noxious
weed, that grows among wheat; app. darnel-grass; the lolium temulentum of Linn.; so in the
present day;] a certain grain, (Msb,) the bitter
grain, (M,) that mingles with wheat, (S, M, Msb,
K,) and gives a bad quality to it: (Msb:) [the
grain thus called is often, accidentally, or carelessly,
mixed with wheat, and causes giddiness: the plant
resembles that now called شَيْلَم, a decoction of which
is used as an anæsthetic: it is said in the K in
art. شلم that the زؤان is the same as the شَيْلَم:
but it is said in the TA in that art., on the authority of AHn, that the grain of the شَيْلَم does not
intoxicate, (as that of darnel-grass is well known
to do in a certain manner,) and that it is very
bitter: and in the K in art. دنق it is said that the
دَنْقَة is the زُوَان, and the دَنَقَة is the شَيْلَم: the
TA states more fully in that art. that the دَنْقَة is
said by AHn to be the زُوَان that is in wheat,
which is cleared therefrom; and that the دَنَقَة is
said by AA to be the شَيْلَم: Forskål mentions the
زِوَان and the شَيْلَم, as different species, among
undetermined plants, and describes the former
thus: zizania Aleppensibus notissima: inter triticum viget: si semina restant farinæ [sic] mixta,
hominem reddunt ex panis esu temulentum: messores plantam non separant; sed post triturationem
vanni aut cribri ope semina rejiciunt: (Flora
Aegypt. Arab. p. 199:)] the n. un. is with ة.
(Msb.)
أَزْأَنِىٌّ: see what next follows.
يَزْأَنِىٌّ and ↓ أَزْأَنِىٌّ, applied as epithets to a spear,
are dial. vars. of يَزَنِىٌّ (K, TA) and أَزَنِىٌّ: (TA:)
spears being thus called in relation to ذُو يَزَنٍ, one
of the Kings of Himyer: (S in art. يزن:) as also
آزَنِىٌّ and أَيْزَنِىٌّ, both formed by transposition.
(TA.)
