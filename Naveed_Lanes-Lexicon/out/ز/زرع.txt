زرع1
زَرَعَ, aor.
زَرَعَ, (K,) inf. n. زَرْعٌ (S, TA) and
زِرَاعَةٌ, (TA,) He sowed, or cast seed; (S, K, TA;)
as also ↓ اِزْدَرَعَ, (S, Msb, K,) originally اِزْتَرَعَ, the
ت being changed into د in order that it may
agree with the ز, (S, K,) for د and ز are pronounced with the voice as well as the breath,
whereas ت is pronounced with the breath only:
(S, TA:) [or the latter verb, as appears from an
explanation of it to be found below, may signify
he sowed for himself.] They say, مَنْ زَرَعَ حَصَدَ
[He who sows reaps]. (TA.) And [they use
this verb transitively, saying,] زَرَعْتُ البُرَّ وَالشَّعِيرَ
[I sowed wheat and barley]: and in like manner,
زَرَعْتُ الشَّجَرَ [I sowed the trees; or sowed the seeds
which should produce the trees: or it may signify
I planted the trees]. (Ibn-Abi-l-Hadeed.) And
زَرَعَ الحُبَّ لَكَ فِى القُلُوبِ كَرَمُكَ وَحُسْنُ خُلُقِكَ
(tropical:)  [Thy generosity and the goodness of thy disposition have sown love for thee in the hearts].
(TA.) And it is said in a trad., مَنْ كَانَتْ لَهُ أَرْضٌ
فَلِيَزْرَعْهَا أَوْ لِيَمْنَحْهَا أَخَاهُ فَإِنْ أَبَى فَلِيُمْسِكْ أَرْضَهُ
[Whoso hath land,] let him sow it [or let him lend
it, or give it, to his brother; and if he refuse, let
him retain his land]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  زَرَعَ الأَرْضَ,
(Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. زَرْعٌ, (Msb,) signifies [also]
(tropical:)  He ploughed up, or tilled, or cultivated, the
land, or ground, for sowing. (Mgh, Msb.)
Hence [the saying in a trad.], إِذَا زَرَعَتْ هٰذِهِ الأُمَّةُ
نُزِعَ مِنْهَا النَّصْرُ (tropical:)  When this nation shall employ
itself altogether with agriculture and the affairs
of the present world, and turn away from warring
against unbelievers and the like, aid shall be withdrawn from it. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  زَرَعَهُ اللّٰهُ signifies
God caused it, or made it, to grow, vegetate, or
germinate; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) and, to increase;
(Mgh;) namely, الحَرْثَ [the seed-produce]. (Mgh,
Msb;) The verb is properly thus used of divine
affairs, exclusively of human: (Er-Rághib:) and
hence the saying in the Kur [lvi. 63-4], أَفَرَأَيْتُمْ مَا
تَحْرُثُونَ أَأَنْتُمْ تَزْرَعُونَهُ أَمْ نَحْنُ الزَّارِعُونَ (S, * Er-Rághib) Now think ye, what ye sow, do ye cause
it to grow, or are We the causers of growth?
(Bd:) or, as some say, do ye cause it to increase,
or are We the causers of its increase? the حَرْث
[or sowing] being ascribed to them, and the زَرْع
[or causing to grow] exclusively to God: when
the latter is ascribed to a man, it is because he
is an agent as a means of making to grow; as
when you say, أَنْبَتُّ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  I was a means of
causing such a thing to grow. (Er-Rághib.) [In
like manner,] you say, زَرْعًا ↓ اِزْدَرَعَ, meaning
(tropical:)  [He raised seed-produce, i. e., was a means of
causing it to grow,] for himself, in particular.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  [Hence,] one says, with respect to a
child, زَرَعَهُ اللّٰهُ (tropical:)  May God render him sound and
strong; syn. جَبَرَهُ: (S, K, TA:) like as one says
أَنْبَتَهُ اللّٰهُ: and in like manner, زَرَعَ اللّٰهُ وَلَدَكَ لِلْخَيْرِ
(tropical:)  [May God render thine offspring sound and
strong, or rather, cause thine offspring to grow
up, for the doing, or enjoyment, of what is good].
(TA.) ―
-b5-  [Hence also,] زُرِعَ لَهُ بَعْدُ شَقَاوَةٍ (tropical:)  [An
increase was made for him after adversity; or]
he obtained property after want; for the verb in
this instance is like عُنِىَ. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
3
مُزَارَعَةٌ is of the measure مُفَاعَلَةٌ, [denoting a
mutual action,] from الزِّرَاعَةُ, (Mgh,) and its signification is well known; (S;) i. e. (tropical:)  The making
a contract, or bargain, with another, for labour
upon land, [to till and sow and cultivate it, as is
indicated in the Mgh and Msb,] for a share, or
portion, of its produce, (Msb, K, TA,) the seed
being from the owner of the land. (K, TA.)
[You say, زَارَعَهُ (tropical:)  He made with him a contract,
or bargain, such as is above described; and in like
manner, خَابَرَهُ, and آكَرَهُ. The doing this is forbidden, because of the uncertainty of the result.]
4
ازرع It (a plant, or herbage,) had, or became
in the state of having, زَرْع [i. e. produce of its
seed; i. e. it grew from its seed]: (TA:) and,
said of زَرْع [or seed-produce], it became tall:
(K:) or, as some say, it produced its leaves: and
it attained to the proper time for its being reaped.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  ازرع النَّاسُ signifies أَمْكَنَهُمُ الزَّرْعُ [expl.
in the TK as meaning The men, or people, became
able to sow seed; i. e., became possessors of seed:
but I rather think that it means they had seedproduce within their power, or reach; they became able to avail themselves thereof; or they
attained to a season when they had seed produce]. (K.)

TA,) used as a subst. properly so termed, signitying Seed-produce; what is raised by means of
sowing; (Mgh, Msb;) what is sown; (K, TA;)
while in growth, [i. e. standing corn, and the
like,] (K and TA voce أَزْرَعَ,) and also after it has
been reaped; (S and Msb and K in art. رفع, &c.;)
its predominant application is to wheat and barley;
