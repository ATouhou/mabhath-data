زيبأَزْيَبُ is of the measure أَفْعَلُ, (S,) like أَحْمَرُ:
(K:) or, as some say, of the measure فَعْيَل; but
this is a weak assertion, for it is said that there
is no Arabic word of this measure; مَرْيَمُ being a
foreign proper name, and ضَهْيَأ being disputed.
(MF, TA.) [In some of its senses it is an epithet, and used as such: in some, app. an epithet
in which the quality of a subst. is predominant:
and in some, a simple subst.: but in all its senses
it is imperfectly decl.; and therefore seems to be
originally an epithet.] ―
-b2-  Brisk, lively, sprightly,
agile, or quick. (K.) ―

short steps: (TA:) and short in stature and in
step; (K, TA;) likewise applied to a man.

father; or who is claimed as a son by a person

-b10-  [A south-easterly
wind; i. e.] the [wind termed] نَكْبَآء [q. v.] that blows
between the صَبَا and the جَنُوب: (S, M, K:) or
the south wind, or a southerly wind; syn. جَنُوبٌ;
(M, K;) of the dial. of Hudheyl; so affirm Mbr
in his “ Kámil ” and IF and Et-Tarábulusee:
IAth says that the people of Mekkeh use this
appellation much; and it is related to be God's
name for what men call the جنوب: Sh says that
the people of El-Yemen, and those who voyage
upon the sea between Juddah and 'Adan, cali
the جنوب by the name of الأَزْيَبُ, and know not
any other name for it; and that is because it is
boisterous, and stirs up the sea, turning it upsidedown: [whence it seems to mean the boisterous,
or violent:] ISh says that ذَاتُ أَزْيَبَ signifies
any violent wind. (L,TA.) ―
-b11-  [Hence it appears
that it signifies also Violence.] ―
-b12-  Also Enmity.
(S, K.) ―

وَلَهُ أَزْيَبُ مُنْكَرَةٌ [Such a one passed having a disapproved briskness, &c.]: this is said when one
passes quickly by reason of briskness, &c. (ISk,
S.) ―
-b14-  And Fear, or fright: (AZ, S, K:) and so
أَذْيَبُ. (K in art. ذيب.) One says, أَخَذَنِى مِنْ
فُلَانٍ الأَزْيَبُ [Fear, or fright, arising from such
a one, seized me]. (AZ, S.)
