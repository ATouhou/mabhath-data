زرنقQ. 1
زَرْنَقَةٌ [as inf. n. of زَرْنَقَ] The irrigating
[land] by means of the زُرْنُوق [here app. meaning
rivulet]. (Mgh, K.) ―
-b2-  And The setting up a
[pillar-like structure such as is termed] زُرْنُوق by
a well. (K.)
-A2-  One says also, زَرْنَقْتُهُ, (K,) inf. n.
as above, (TK,) meaning I clad him [app. فِى
الثِّيَابِ in the clothes: see Q. 2]: or زَرْنَقْتُ اللِّبَاسِ
إِيَّاهُ I put the clothing upon him; or clad him
therewith. (TK)
-A3-  And لَا يُزَرْنِقُكَ أَحَدٌ عَلَى
فَضْلِ زَيْدٍ [No one will exceed to thee the excel-lence of Zeyd]. (TA. [It is there indicated that
this is from زَرْنَقَةٌ as syn. with زِيَادَةٌ.])
-A4-  [See
زَرْنَقَةٌ as a simple subst. below.]
Q. 2
تَزَرْنَقَ He drew water by means of the
زُرْنُوق, (Mgh, K, TA,) or the زُرْنُوقَانِ, (TA,) for
hire. (Mgh, K, TA.) Hence the saying of 'Alee,
لَا أَدَعُ الحَجَّ وَلَوْ تَزَرْنَقْتُ, meaning I will not omit,
or neglect, the pilgrimage, though I should draw
water by means of the زرنوق, or زرنوقان, and perform it with the hire obtained thereby: thus it is
explained: another explanation will be found in
what follows. (Mgh, TA.)
-A2-  تزرنق فِى الثِّيابِ
He clad, and covered, himself in the clothes.
(K.) ―
-b2-  And hence, [it is said,] because implying
concealment of the excess [of the price] in the
sale, (TA,) تزرنق also signifies تَعَيَّنَ, (Mgh, K,
TA, [in the CK, erroneously, تَغَيَّرَ,]) from الزَّرْنَقَةُ
meaning العِينَةُ; (Mgh;) i. e. He bought on credit,
for an excess [in the amount of the price]. (TK.)
And accord. to some, وَلَوْ تَزَرْنَقْتُ, in the saying of
'Alee mentioned above, means وَلَوْ تَعَيَّنْتُ, (Mgh,)
i. e. وَلَوْ تَعَيَّنْتُ عِينَةَ الزَّادِ وَالرَّاحِلَةِ [though I should
buy on credit, for more than the current price,
the travelling-provision and the camel to be ridden]:
(TA:) but the former explanation is the more
likely. (Mgh.)
زَرْنَقَةٌ inf. n. of زَرْنَقَ. (TK. [See Q. 1, above.])
-A2-  Also i. q. عِينَةٌ; (IAar, JK, Mgh, K;) i. e.
The buying of a thing from a man on credit, for
more than its [current] price: (JK, Fáïk:) or
the doing thus, and then selling it to him, or to
another, for less than the price for which it was
purchased. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And Increase, excess, or
addition; syn. زِيَادَةٌ. (K.) [For زَرْنَقَةٌ in this and
the following senses, Freytag, in his Lex., has
written زَرْنَق.] ―
-b3-  And Debt. (K, TA. [In the
CK, الدِّينُ is erroneously put for الدَّيْنُ: and it
is there added, “as though arabicized from زَرْنَهْ;
i. e. الذَّهَبَ لَبِسَ: ” but what this should be I know
not, unless it be a mistranscription for الذَّهَبُ لَيْسَ;
for, in Pers., زَرْ means “ gold,” and نَهْ is a negative.])
-A3-  Also Perfect, or consummate, beauty.
(K.)
زُرْنُوقٌ, as some pronounce it, is by others pronounced زَرْنُوقٌ, which is of a strange form, [said
to be] of the measure فَعْنُولٌ, (IJ, TA,) mentioned
by Kr on the authority of Lh: (TA:) [the dual]
زُرْنُوقَانِ, (S, Mgh, K,) mentioned by J in art.
زرق, the ن being regarded by him as augmentative, but by the author of the K as radical, (TA,)
also pronounced زَرْنُوقَانِ, (K,) signifies Two pillarlike structures (مَنَارَتَانِ) constructed by the head
of a well, (S, Mgh, K,) on the two sides thereof;
(K;) or two walls; or two posts; (Mgh;) across
which is placed a piece of wood, (S, Mgh,) called
the نَعَامَة; (S;) and to this is suspended the pulley
by means of which the water is drawn: (S, Mgh:)
or two structures like the signs set up to show
the way, by the brink of a well, of clay or of
stones: (TA:) accord. to the S, (TA,) if of wood,
they are called دِعَامَتَان: or, as El-Kilábee says,
if of wood, they are called نَعَامَتَانِ, and the crosspiece is called the عَجَلَة, and to this the large
bucket is suspended: (S, TA:) pl. زَرَانِيقُ. (TA.)
―
-b2-  زُرْنُوقٌ also signifies A rivulet; (Sh, Mgh, K;)
app. a rivulet in which runs the water that is
drawn by means of the زرنوق. (Sh, Mgh,* TA.)
زِرْنِيقٌ i. q. زِرْنِيخٌ [i. e. Arsenic]; an arabicized
word; (K;) as is also the latter [q. v.]. (TA.)
مُزَرْنِقٌ A setter-up of what are termed زَرْنُوقَانِ.
(TA.)
