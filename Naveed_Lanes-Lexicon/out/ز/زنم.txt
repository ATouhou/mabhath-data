[in the latter of which is added, “because the
cutting of the ear is a mark: ” but by its زنمة is
here meant “ its wattle; ” for the cutting of the

[Sundry spoils consisting of the young camels the
offspring of Muzennem]: (S:) thus A'Obeyd
read, instead of إِفَالٍ مُزَنَّمِ, in which the latter
word is used for مُزَنَّمَةٍ, [by poetic license,] because
إِفَالٌ is of a measure common to masc. and fem.
words. (EM p. 120.)
