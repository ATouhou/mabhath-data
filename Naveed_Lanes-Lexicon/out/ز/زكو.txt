زكو1
زَكَا, aor. يَزْكُو, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) inf. n.
زَكَآءٌ, (S,) or زُكُوٌّ, (Msb, [accord. to which the
former seems to be a simple subst.,]) or both,
(K, TA,) the latter like عُلُوٌّ, as in the M, but
accord. to [some of] the copies of the K زَكْوٌ,
(TA,) It increased, or augmented; (S, Msb, K,
TA;) it received increase and blessing from God;
it throve by the blessing of God; (Er-Rághib,
TA;) and produced fruit; (TA in art. زكى;)
and زَكِىَ, (K in that art.,) aor. يَزْكَى, inf. n.
زَكَاةٌ, (TA in that art.,) signifies the same, (K, TA,)
mentioned by ISd, on the authority of Lh, as a dial.
var. of زَكَا, aor. يزكو; (TA;) and so ↓ ازكى;
(Msb, K;) and ↓ تزكّى: (K in art. زكى:) it is said
of seed-produce, (S, Msb, Er-Rághib, TA,) and of
wealth, or cattle &c., and of other things: of anything that increases, or augments, one says يَزْكُو,
inf. n. زَكَآءٌ. (TA.) [This is the primary meaning: or, accord. to some, the primary meaning is,
It was, or became, pure:] some say that the root
denotes purity: and some, that it denotes a state
of increase, or augmentation. (Mgh.) You say
also زَكَتِ الأَرْضُ The land throve, or yielded
increase. (Msb.) And زَكَا الغُلَامُ [The boy grew,
or throve], inf. n. زُكُوٌّ and زَكَآءٌ, on the authority
of Akh. (S.) And زَكَا عَمَلُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [His deed, or
work, throve]. (K in art. در.) It is said in a
trad. of 'Alee, المَالُ تَنْقُصُهُ النَّفَقَةُ وَالعِلْمُ يَزْكُو عَلَى
الإِنْفَاقِ (assumed tropical:)  [Wealth, what one expends diminishes it,
but knowledge increases by expending]: زَكَآء being
thus predicated of knowledge, though this is not a
corporeal thing. (TA.) Accord. to El-Umawee,
(S,) said of a man, زَكَا, (S, K,) aor. يَزْكُو, inf. n.
زُكُوٌّ, (S,) means He enjoyed, or led, a plentiful,
and a pleasant or an easy, and a soft or delicate,
life; (S, K;) was in a state of abundance of the
goods, conveniences, or comforts, of life. (S.)
And likewise said of a man, (having the same
aor. and inf. n., TA,) it means also He was, or
became, good, or righteous; (Jel in xxiv. 21,
Msb, K, TA;) and pure from sin. (Jel ibid.)
[Hence,] هٰذَا الأَمْرُ لَا يَزْكُو بِفُلَانٍ means This
thing, or affair, will not be suitable to such a
one; will not befit him. (S.)
2
زكّاهُ, inf. n. تَزْكِيَةٌ: see 4. ―
-b2-  Also He
purified him, or it. (Er-Rághib, TA.) Sometimes the agent of the verb in this sense is a man;
as in the saying in the Kur [xci. 9], قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَنْ
زَكَّاهَا [Verily he prospereth who purifieth it;
namely, his soul]: sometimes it is God; as in
[the saying in the Kur xxiv. 21,] وَلٰكِنَّ اللّٰهَ يُزَكِّى
مَنْ يَشَآءُ [But God purifieth whom He willeth]:
and sometimes it is the Prophet; as in the saying
[in the Kur ix. 104], خُذْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ صَدَقَةً تُطَهِّرُهُمْ
وَتُزَكِّيهِمْ بِهَا [Take thou, from their possessions, a
poor-rate, whereby thou shalt cleanse them and
purify them; where (J says in the S) they say
that تُزَكِّيهِمْ means the same as تُطَهِّرُهُمْ]; and in
the saying [in the Kur ii. 146], يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتِنَا
وَيُزَكِّيكُمْ [Who reciteth to you our signs, and
purifieth you]. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence,
accord. to what is said in the Kur ix. 104, i. e.
because the act which it signifies is believed to
purify the performer, or because it is believed to
purify, or to occasion an increase of, the rest of
his property,] زكّى مَالَهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n.
as above, (S, Msb,) He gave the زَكَاة [or poorrate] from his property. (S, Mgh.) And زكّاهُ,
(S,) or زكّاهُمْ, (Mgh,) He took (S, Mgh) his,
(S,) or their, (Mgh,) زَكَاة [or poor-rate]. (S,
Mgh.) ―
-b4-  زَكَّيْتُهُ also signifies I attributed to him
زَكَآء, i. e. [purity, or] goodness, or righteousness.
(Msb.) [And hence, I praised him.] And زكّى
نَفْسَهُ, (S, Mgh,) inf. n. as above, (S,) He praised
himself. (S, Mgh.) The doing this is forbidden
in the Kur liii. 33. (Er-Rághib, TA.) Hence,
also, تَزْكِيَةُ الشُّهُودِ The pronouncing the witnesses
to be veracious, and good, or righteous. (Mgh.)
-A2-  هُوَ يُخَسِّى وَيُزَكِّى He plays, and says, “Is
it even or odd [or rather odd or even]?” (TA in
art. خسو;) he takes, or holds, something in his
hand, and says, “Is it even or odd [or odd or
even]?” (TA in the present art.) [See زَكَا
below.]
4
ازكاهُ He (God) made it to increase, or
augment; (S, Msb, K;) [made it to thrive; and
put it into a good, or right, state, or condition;] namely, seed-produce, (S, Msb, TA,) and
wealth, or cattle &c, and any other thing capable
of increase; (TA;) as also ↓ زكّاهُ, (Msb, K, TA,)
inf. n. تَزْكِيَةٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also He put it into a
bag, or some other receptacle; namely, property:
thus expl. by Aboo-Moosà. (Nh, TA.)
-A2-  See
also 1, first sentence.
5
تزكّى: see 1, first sentence. ―
-b2-  Also He
became purified; or he purified himself: (TA:)
also pronounced اِزَّكَّى, aor. يَزَّكَّى. (Bd in
xxxv. 19.) ―
-b3-  And He endeavoured to attain
much piety; from الزَّكَآءُ. (Bd in lxxxvii. 14.) ―
-b4-
And He gave the poor-rate. (S.)
زَكَا, (S, K, * TA,) without tenween, and accord.
to some with tenween, and not having the article
ال prefixed to it; and in like manner خَسَا, which
is coupled with the former, is without tenween,
and accord. to some with tenween, and not having
the article ال prefixed to it; (TA;) [but each has
ال prefixed to it in the K;] i. q. الشَّفْعُ (S, K) مِنَ
العَدَدِ (K) [or شَفْعٌ, as meaning An even number;
a number consisting of pairs; or a single
pair]: said to be so called because the pair
are more, or more perfect, or better, (↓ أَزْكَى,)
than is the one. (TA.) You say خَسَا أَوْ زَكَا or
خَسًا أَوْ زَكًا [Odd or even?]. (TA.) [See more
voce خَسَا.]
زَكَاةٌ. or زَكٰوةٌ, [accord. to El-Hareeree, to be
written with ا when prefixed to a pronoun, and
also in the dual number, (see De Sacy's Anthol.
Gram. Arabe, p. 67 of the Arabic text,) but this
rule I have not found to be generally observed,
even in the best MSS., nor have I in the similar
cases of صَلٰوةٌ and حَيٰوةٌ, (to which it is also
applied,) in the best copies of the Kur-án,] of the
measure فَعَلَةٌ, [i. e., originally زَكَوَةٌ,] like صَدَقَةٌ
[which is one of its syns.]; a noun of the class of
homonyms: (IAth, TA:) it signifies Increase, or
augmentation, (IAth, Er-Rághib, TA,) as also
↓ زَكَآءٌ [mentioned in the first paragraph as an
inf. n.], (Msb,) resulting from the blessing of
God; and this is [said to be] the primary meaning; and is considered as relating to the things of
the present world and to those of the world to
come. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―
-b2-  And Purity. (IAth,
TA.) And [particularly] The dryness of the earth
or ground; which is its purity from defilement.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And Purification: a meaning which it
is said to have in the saying in the Kur [xxiii. 4],
وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِلزَّكٰوةِ فَاعِلُونَ, (IAth, Mgh, Er-Rághib, TA,) i. e. And who are acting in their
religious service for God's purification of them;
or for their purification of themselves: for
لِلزَّكٰوة is not here an objective complement of
فَاعِلُونَ; the ل therein denoting the aim and the
cause. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―
-b4-  Also, [as being a
mode of purification of oneself,] Good, or righteous,
conduct: and in this sense it has been expl. as
used in the Kur xviii. 80: or as meaning goodness, or righteousness: (TA:) which ↓ زَكَآءٌ [also]
signifies. (Msb.) And Religious service; as being
the means of purification: so [accord. to some] it
signifies in the saying [in the Kur xix. 14],
وَحَنَانًا مِنْ لَدُنَّا وَزَكٰوةً [And the disposition to
mercy, or compassion, from us, and religious
service]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or it here means طُهْرَة
[i. e. purification, or purity]: and [accord. to some,
if we except the instances mentioned above in the
next two preceding sentences,] this is the only
instance in the Kur-án in which it is used in any
other sense than that which next follows. (Kull
p. 199.) ―
-b5-  And [The poor-rate;] the portion,
or amount, of property, that is given therefrom,
(M, IAth, Mgh, Msb, K, Er-Rághib, TA,) as the
due of God, (Er-Rághib, TA,) by its possessor,
(M, K, TA,) to the poor, (M, Mgh, Er-Rághib,
TA,) in order that he may purify it thereby:
(M, IAth, K, TA:) [in the S it is merely said
that “ the زَكٰوة of property is well known: ” the
giving it is obligatory, provided that the property
is of a certain amount, and has been in possession
eleven months: the portion given varies according to the nature and amount of the property;
but is generally a fortieth part thereof, or of its
value; i. e. two and a half per cent.:] it is thus
termed [for the reason assigned above; or] as
being a cause of the hope of increase, (Msb, Er-Rághib, TA,) or as causing the soul, or person,
to thrive, or grow, by means of good things and
blessings [procured thereby], or for both of these
reasons. (Er-Rághib, TA.) زَكَاةُ الفِطْرِ [The alms
of the breaking of the fast, given at the end of
Ramadán,] is obligatory upon every person of the
Muslims, the free and the slave, the male and the
female, the young and the old, the poor and the
rich; and purifies the faster from unprofitable and
lewd discourse: it consists of a صَاع [q. v.] of
dates, or of barley, [or of raisins or some other
ordinary kind of food,] or half that quantity of
wheat. (El-Jámi' es-Sagheer, voce زَكَاة.) [The
pl. is زَكَوَاتٌ.] ―
-b6-  Also, [as being an attribution
of purity or goodness or righteousness,] Praise.
(IAth, TA.) ―
-b7-  And The pure, or best, part of
a thing: (K, TA:) on the authority of Aboo-'Alee.
(TA.)
زَكَآءٌ an inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (S, K.) See also
the next preceding paragraph, in two places. ―
-b2-
Also [The increase of the earth; or] the fruits
caused to come forth by God. (TA.)
زَكِىٌّ i. q. ↓ زَاكٍ, (Akh, S,) which signifies Increasing [&c., as act part. n. of زَكَا, q. v.]: (Ham
p. 722:) [and growing, or thriving]: applied in
this sense to a boy. (Akh, S.) ―
-b2-  غُلَامًا زَكِيًّا in
the Kur xix. 19 means [A boy] pure from sins:
or growing, or increasing, in goodness and righteousness: (Bd:) or purified by nature: or such
as shall in the future become purified. (TA.) And
نَفْسًا زَكِيَّةً in the Kur xviii. 73 means [A soul, or
person,] pure from sins: some read ↓ زَاكِيَةً; but
the former is more forcible: [or,] accord. to AA,
↓ the latter means that has never sinned: and the
former, that has sinned and then been forgiven.
(Bd.) [Or] رَجُلٌ زَكِىٌّ signifies A good, or
righteous, man: and the pl. is أَزْكِيَآءُ. (Msb, K, *
TA.) And also A man enjoying, or leading, a
plentiful, and a pleasant or an easy, and a soft or
delicate, life: pl. as above. (K, TA.) ―
-b3-  And
أَرْضٌ زَكِيَّةٌ Good, fat land. (TA in art زكى.)
زَكَوِىٌّ [generally meaning Of, or relating to,
the poor-rate] is the rel. n. of زَكَاةٌ; like as
حَصَوِىٌّ is that of حَصَاةٌ; because the rel. n. reduces the word to its original form: زَكَائِىٌّ is
vulgar and wrong. (Msb.)
زَاكٍ, and its fem. زَاكِيَةٌ: see زَكِىٌّ, in three
places.
أَزْكَى More, or most, profitable: (Bd in
ii. 232:) or better, or best: (Jel ibid:) more, or
most, pure: (Bd in xxiv. 28:) more, or most,
lawful, (Bd and Jel in xviii. 18,) and good, or
pleasant: or more, or most, abundant and cheap.
(Bd ibid.) See also زَكَا as a noun.
