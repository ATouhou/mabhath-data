زوق2
زوّقهُ, (O, Msb, TA,) inf. n. تَزْوِيقٌ, (Msb, K,)
[seems to signify primarily He washed it over
with زَاوُوق, i. e. quicksilver; he silvered it therewith.] One says, زوّق الدَّرَاهِمَ [He washed over
the dirhems with quicksilver]; from الزَّاوُوقُ. (MA.)
―
-b2-  [Then, He gilded it with an amalgam of
quicksilver and gold: see زَاوُوقٌ. ―
-b3-  And hence,]
He decorated it, and embellished it; namely, a
thing [of any kind: and particularly he painted
it]: but IF says that زوّقهُ, meaning thus, is without foundation; that they say it is from الزَّوُوقُ
meaning الزِئْبَقُ; [as it is said to be in the K;]
but that this is [mere] assertion. (O, TA.)
[Whether properly or improperly, however,] one
says, زَوَّقَ البَيْتَ بِالزَّاوُوقِ, i. e. He decorated the
house, or chamber, [perhaps meaning the House
of God, at Mekkeh, i. e. the Kaabeh, as appears
to be probable from what here follows,] and
changed its colour and its fashion or semblance,
with زاووق, i. e. زئبق. (Har p. 107.) And it is
related in a trad. that he [Mohammad] said to
Ibn-'Omar, إِذَا رَأَيْتَ قُرَيْشًا قَدْ هَدَمُوا البَيْتَ ثُمَّ بَنَوْهُ
فَزَوَّقُوهُ فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتَ المَوْتَ فَمُتْ [When thou seest
Kureysh shall have demolished the House of God,
then built it again, and decorated it, if thou be
able to die, then die]: he disliked the تَزْوِيق of
mosques because of its inducing desire for the
things of the present world, and its finery, or
because of its diverting the person praying. (TA.)
―
-b4-  One says also, (TA,) زَوَّقْتُ الكَلَامَ, and الكِتَابَ,
(assumed tropical:)  I embellished the speech, or language, and the
writing, or book; and (tropical:)  I rectified, or corrected,
it. (S, TA.) And زَوَّرَ فُلَانٌ كِتَابَهُ and زَوَّقَهُ both
mean (tropical:)  Such a one rectified, or corrected, his
writing, or book. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And زَوَّقُوا الجَارِيَةَ
They embellished the girl, or young woman, with
نُقُوش [or decorations, app. such as are made by
tattooing, or staining with حِنَّآء]: such decoration
is termed ↓ زَوَاقٌ, like سَحَابٌ: and hence, ↓ تَزَيَّقِى,
[Embellish thyself &c.,] said to a woman; [so
that it is originally ↓ تَزَوَّقِى;] or this is from زيق,
[i. e. زِيقٌ,] with ى. (TA.)

تَزَوَّقَ see the last sentence above, in two places.
زُوَقٌ: see زَاوُوقٌ.
زَوَقَةٌ [pl. of زَائِقٌ, act. part. n. of the unused verb
زَاقَ,] Decorators, or embellishers, of the ceilings of
houses or chambers. (AA, TA.) [See also زَوَّاقٌ.]
زَوَاقٌ: see 2, last sentence.
[
زَوَّاقٌ A decorator; an embellisher: and particularly a painter. See also زَوَقَةٌ, above.]
زَاوُوقٌ, (S, O, K, [in the CK written زاؤُقْ, as though
it were زَاؤُوقٌ, the quiescent و being indicated by the
sign of sukoon after the dammeh,]) of the dial. of
the people of El-Medeeneh, (AA, S, O,) i. q. زِئْبَقٌ
[i. e. Quicksilver]; (AA, S, O, K;) as also ↓ زُوَقٌ;
(AA, O, K;) but from what is said by IB, it
would seem that this last word is pl. of زَاوُوقٌ:
(TA:) it is used in ↓ تَزَاوِيق [meaning decorations, or embellishments, pl. of تَزْويقٌ used as a
simple subst., or of the n. un. تَزْوِيقَةٌ]; (S, O;)
and hence, [accord. to some,] التَّزْوِيقُ signifying
“ the act of decorating, and embellishing; ” (K;)
for it is put, together with gold, (S, O, K,) for
overlaying therewith, (K,) upon iron, (S, O,) and
then it is put into the fire, whereupon the زئبق
[or quicksilver] goes from it [by evaporation],
and the gold remains: (S, O, K:) and hence
anything decorated, or embellished, is termed
↓ مُزَوَّقٌ, (S, O,) though not having in it زئبق. (S.)
تَزْوِيقٌ inf. n. of 2. (Msb.) [Used as a simple
subst., this, or the n. un. تَزْوِيقَةٌ, has for its pl.
تَزَاوِيقُ:] see the next preceding paragraph.
مُزَوَّقٌ Washed over with [زَاوُوق or] زِئْبَق [i. e.
quicksilver]; applied to a dirhem. (TA.) Decorated therewith (TA) [or with an amalgam of
quicksilver and gold subjected to the action of fire
so that the quicksilver is evaporated]. ―
-b2-  And
hence, (TA,) Anything decorated, or embellished,
(S, O, Msb, K, TA,) though not having in it
زِئْبَق. (S, O.) See زَاوُوقٌ. ―
-b3-  Also, applied to
speech, or language, (assumed tropical:)  Embellished: (Kr, TA:)
and applied to a book, or writing, [in the same
sense: (see 2:) or] as meaning (tropical:)  rectified, or corrected; like مُزَوَّرٌ. (AZ, TA.)
