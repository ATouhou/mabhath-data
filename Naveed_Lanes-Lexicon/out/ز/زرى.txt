in the CK and in one of my copies of the S and

ازرى بِهِ, inf. n. إِزْرَآءٌ, He held it (i. e. a thing,
S, Msb, or a case, or an affair, K) in little, or
light, or mean, estimation, or in contempt; (S,
Mgh, Msb, K;) as also ↓ اِزْدَرَاهُ. (Mgh.) And
i. q. قَصَّرَ بِهِ [app. here meaning (in like manner
as it is rendered below in this paragraph) He fell
short of that estimation which was required by
him, or due to him]; and ↓ اِزْدَرَاهُ, i. e. he contemned, or despised, him; [and so, app., ↓ استزراهُ;
(see مُزْدَرٍ;)] or made him to be contemned or
despised; syn. حَقَرَهُ or حَقَّرَهُ. (S, accord. to different copies. [But whether this last explanation be
here meant to relate to ازرى به and ازدراه or to
the latter alone, is not clear.]) He lowered his
condition, or estimation. (Ham p. 117.) He
brought against him the imputation of a fault, or
vice, or the like, ('Eyn, K, TA,) or a thing, or
an affair, or an action, whereby he desired to
involve him in confusion. (ISd, K, TA.) ازرى
بِعِلْمِهِ and بِهِ ↓ زَرَى, mentioned, but not explained,
by Lh, are thought by ISd to signify قَصَّرَ بِهِ [app.
meaning He fell short of that estimation which
was required by, or due to, his knowledge]. (TA.)
