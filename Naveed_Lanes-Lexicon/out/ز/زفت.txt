زفت2
زفّت He smeared a receptacle [such as a
wine-skin and a wine-jar] with زِفْت. (Msb.)
زِفْتٌ [Pitch: or tar: or a sort of pitch: or
crude pitch:] i. q. قَارٌ: (A, Mgh, K:) or قِيرٌ:
(Msb:) or قَطِرَانٌ: (A, Msb:) or it is like قِيرٌ:
(S:) it is not the قِير with which ships are smeared,
but [like this inasmuch as] it is also a black substance, with which wine-skins are seasoned; for
the قير of ships dries upon them, whereas the زفت
of skins does not dry: (TA:) or [crude pitch;
i. e.] a produce of the pine, or pitch-tree; which
is of two sorts, moist and dry; the latter being
either cooked, or congealed of itself; such as
flows of itself from the trees is called زفت; such
as is prepared by cooking, and art, قَطِرَانٌ. (TK.)
[See also كُفْرٌ: and see De Sacy's “ Abd-allatif,”
p. 273.] ―
-b2-  Also, (K, * TA,) i. e. زِفْتٌ, (TA,)
[not مُزَفَّتٌ, which Freytag has supposed to be
here intended in the K, and not without some
reason, for the passage is ambiguous,] A certain
medicine; (K, TA;) a thing that comes forth
from the earth, [app. a sort of bitumen, perhaps
another name for قَفْرٌ يَهُودِىٌّ bitumen Judaicum,
or Jew's pitch,] that is an ingredient in medicines:
not the زفت commonly known. (TA.)
مُزَفَّتٌ Smeared with زِفْت; (S, A, * Mgh, K;)
applied to a wine-skin, (A,) or a vessel, or receptacle for wine; i. q. مُقَيَّرٌ. (TA.) The receptacle
thus termed quickly occasions alteration [or fermentation] in the wine [contained in it]. (Mgh.)
You say جَرَّةٌ مُزَفَّتَةٌ A jar smeared with زِفْت.
(S.) And it is said in a trad., نَهَى عَنِ المُزَفَّتِ
[He forbade the use of that skin, or vessel, which
is smeared with زفت, for the beverage called
نَبِيذ]. (TA.)
