زنجفرزُنْجُفْرٌ A certain dye, [or pigment,] well known,
(K,) of a red colour, with which one writes as
well as dyes; [namely, cinnabar:] its virtue is
similar to that of white lead; or, as some say, of
شَادَنْج [a kind of stone, used medicinally, from
the Persian شَادْنَهْ]: it is of two kinds, native and
factitious: the native is [formed by] the transition of a sulphureous substance into quicksilver:
[it is a sulphureous ore of quicksilver:] the factitious [is what is called vermilion, and] is of
various sorts. (TA.)
