زَلَلْتَ, [third pers. زَلَّ,] aor. تَزِلُّ; (S, K;)
and زَلِلْتَ, [third pers. likewise زَلَّ,] aor. تَزَلُّ;
(Fr, S, K;) inf. n. زَلِيلٌ, (Lh, S, K,) which is of
the former verb, (S,) and زَلٌّ, (Lh, K,) also of
the former verb, (Msb,) and زُلُولٌ and زِلِّيلَى [or,
accord. to the S, this is a simple subst.,] and

former verb,] and زَلَلٌ, (Fr, S, K,) which is of the
latter verb; (Fr, S;) Thou slippedst (K) in mud,

aor. يَزِلُّ, inf. n. زَلٌّ [&c. as above]; and زَلَّ, aor.
يَزَلُّ, inf. n. زَلَلٌ; the former verb of the class of
ضَرَبَ; and the latter, of the class of تَعِبَ; meaning he, or it, moved away, or aside, [or slipped,]

(Msb.) فَإِنْ زَلَلْتُمْ, in the Kur ii. 205, means But

fully: (Jel:) this is the common reading: but
some read زَلِلْتُمْ. (TA.) And you say, زَلَّ زَلَّةً He
committed a slip in speech and the like. (TA.)
Accord. to IAth, زَلِيلٌ signifies The passing of a
body from one place to another: and ―
-b2-  hence it
is metaphorically used in like manner in relation
to a benefit: one says, زَلَّتْ مِنْهُ إِلَى فُلَانٍ نِعْمَةٌ,
inf. n. زَلِيلٌ, meaning (tropical:)  A benefit passed, or was
transferred, from him, (i. e. a benefactor,) to such
a one. (TA.) ―
-b3-  زَلَّ, inf. n. زَلِيلٌ and زُلُولٌ, also
signifies He (a man) passed along quickly: (ISh,
K:) and زَلَّ, inf. n. زَلِيلٌ, he ran: and زَلِيلٌ, a
light, or an agile, walking or pacing: (TA:)
[and زَلَلٌ, mentioned above as an inf. n., seems to
have the same, or a similar, signification:] a
rájiz says, (S,) namely, Aboo-Mohammad El-
Hadhlemee, (TA,) or Aboo-Mohammad ElFak'asee, (O,)
إِنَّ لَهَا فِى العَامِ ذِى الفُتُوقِ
وَزَلَلِ النِّيَّةِ وَالتَّصْفِيقِ
رِعْيَةَ مَوْلًى نَاصِحٍ شَفِيقِ
(S in the present art., * and in art. صفق, * and art.
فتق, but in this last with رَبٍّ in the place of
مَوْلًى, and TA,) [i. e. Verily they have, in the
year of little rain, (thus الفتوق, as here used, is
expl. in the S in art. فتق,) and in the passing
along lightly to the place which is the object of
the journey, and in the being removed from a
tract which they have depastured to a place in
which is pasture, (thus التصفيق, as here used, is
expl. in the S in art. صفق,) the tending of a
master honest in his conduct, or desirous of their
good, benevolent, or compassionate]: he is speaking of his camels: (S in art. فتق:) he means
that they pass along lightly [so I render تَزِلُّ]
from place to place in search of herbage: and
النيّة means the place to which they purpose
journeying. (S.) ―
-b4-  [Hence,] زَلَّ عُمُرُهُ (assumed tropical:)  His life
went, or passed, [or glided,] away. (K, TA.) ―

became, light [of flesh] in the hips, or haunches:
(K:) or زَلَلٌ signifies a woman's having little
flesh in the posteriors and thighs. (S.)
-A2-  زَلَّ,
aor. يَزِلُّ, accord. to analogy, as an intrans. v.,
from أَزْلَلْتُ إِلَيْهِ meaning “ I gave to him ” of
food &c., should signify He took, or received:
and hence the saying of the lawyers, وَيَزِلُّ إِنْ عَلِمَ
الرِّضَى And he shall take, or receive, or the food
[if he have knowledge of permission, or consent].
(Msb.)
-A3-  زُلَّ i. q. دُقِّقَ [app. as meaning He, or

made him, or caused him, to slip in mud, (K,
TA,) or in speech, or in judgment, or opinion,

latter, see what follows.]) It is said in the Kur
[ii. 34], فَأَزَلَّهُمَا الشَّيْطَانُ عَنْهَا [And the Devil made
them, or caused them, both, to slip, or fall, from
it, namely, Paradise (الجَنَّة)]; and one reading is
أَزَالَمُهَا, i. e. removed them: or, as some say, it
means caused them to commit a slip, or wrong
action, in consequence of it [referring to the tree]:
or, accord. to Th, caused them to slip in judgment. (TA.) And in the same, iii. 149, ↓ اسْتَزَلَّهُمُ
الشَّيْطَانُ The Devil made them, or caused them,
to slip: (Jel:) or, as some say, sought to make
them commit a slip, or wrong action. (TA.) ―
-b2-
One says also, أَزَلَّ فُلَانًا إِلَى القَوْمِ He sent forward such a one to the people, or party. (TA.)
―
-b3-  And أَزَلَّهُ عَنْ رَأْيِهِ He made him to turn from
his opinion. (MA.) ―
-b4-  And as زَلِيلٌ signifies the

one says, speaking metaphorically, (IAth, TA,)
أَزَلَّ إِلَيْهِ نِعْمَةً (tropical:)  He did to him a benefit: (S,

زَلْزَلَهُ, (S, * Msb, K, &c.,) inf. n. زَلْزَلَةٌ
and زِلْزَالٌ and زَلْزَالٌ and زُلْزَالٌ, (K,) or the first of
these is an inf. n. [by universal consent], (S,) and
so is the second, but the third is a simple subst.,
(Zj, S, Msb,) though this and the fourth [which
is the least known] have the authority of certain
readings of passages of the Kur, namely, xcix. 1
for both of these, and xxxiii. 11 for the latter of
them, (TA,) He put it, or him, into a state of
motion, commotion, or agitation: (Msb, K, TA:)
or into a state of convulsion, or violent motion.
(Zj, TA.) You say, زَلْزَلَ اللّٰهُ الأَرْضَ [i. e. God

them with roughness, violence, or vehemence.
(TA.) Some say that زَلْزَلَةٌ is from الزَّلَلُ فِى الرَّأْىِ
[i. e. “ the making a slip in judgment, or opinion ”]: so when one says, زُلْزِلَ القَوْمُ the meaning is, The people, or party, were turned away
from the right course, and fear was cast into
their hearts. (TA.) It is said in a trad., اَللّٰهُمَّ
اهْزِمِ الأَحْزَابَ وَزَلْزِلْهُمْ i. e. [O God, rout, defeat, or
put to flight, the combined forces, and] make their
state of affairs to be unsound, or unsettled. (TA.)
Accord. to IAmb, أَصَابَتِ القَوْمَ زَلْزَلَةٌ means An
affrighting befell the people, or party; from the
saying in the Kur [ii. 210], وَزُلْزِلُوا حَتَّى يَقُولَ
الرَّسُولُ i. e. And they were affrighted [so that the
Apostle said]: (L, TA:) or were vehemently
agitated. (Ksh, Bd.) ―
-b2-  مَا زَلْزَلْتُ قَطُّ مَآءً أَبْرَدَ مِنْ
مَآءِ الثغوبِ [or الثَّغَبِ, as it is written in the explanation of this saying, the latter being app. the
right reading], said by Aboo-Shembel, means I
have not put into my throat, or fauces, ever, water
slipping into it cooler than the water of the ثَغَب [or
pool left by a torrent in the shade of a mountain].
(Az, TA.)
R. Q. 2
تَزَلْزَلَ It was, or became, in a state of
motion, commotion, agitation, convulsion, or violent motion. (Msb, TA.) You say, تَزَلْزَلَتِ الأَرْضُ
(S, Msb, TA) The earth [quaked: or quaked violently:] was, or became, in a state of motion,
commotion, &c.: (Msb:) the verb in this phrase
[and in others] is quasi-pass. of R. Q. 1. (S, TA.)
And تَزَلْزَلَتْ نَفْسُهُ His soul reciprocated in his
chest at death. (TA.)
زُلٌّ Slippery: (S:) a place in which one slips;
(K;) and ↓ زَلَلٌ signifies the same; (S, K;) and
↓ زَلُولٌ [likewise, i. e.] a place in which the foot
slips. (TA.) You say مَقَامٌ زُلٌّ and ↓ زَلَلٌ, and

wrong action, a mistake, or an error; (Msb, K;)
or a sin, or crime; (K, * TA;) a fall into sin or
crime. (Msb in art. عثر.) One says, زَلَّ الرَّجُلُ
زَلَّةً قَبِيحَةً The man [made a foul slip; or] fell
into the commission of a disapproved, or hateful,
or foul, act; or committed an exorbitant, an
abominable, or a foul, mistake: whence the trad.,
نَعُوذُ بِاللّٰهِ مِنْ زَلَّةِ العَالِمِ [We seek protection by
God from the slip of the learned man]: and the
well-known saying, زَلَّةٌ العَالِمِ زَلَّةُ العَالَمِ [The slip
of the learned man is the slip of the world at
large]. (TA.) ―

(Mgh, * K;) as also ↓ زُلَّةٌ: (K:) a gift. (Msb.)

(Lth, O, Msb.) One says, اِتَّخَذَ فُلَانٌ زَلَّةً [Such
a one made, or prepared, a feast for guests].
(Lth, O, Msb.) Hence, (Lth, TA,) it is also a
name for Food that is carried from the table of
one's friend or relation: a word of the dial. of
El-'Irák: (Lth, Msb, K:) or in this sense it is a
vulgar word, (K, TA,) used by the common
people of El-'Irák (TA.) And i. q. عُرْسٌ [as
meaning A marriage-feast]. (ISh, Az, Msb, K.)
So in the saying, كُنَّا فِى زَلَّةِ فُلَانٍ [We were at

Msb, TA.)

speaks in his Hist. Animalium, l. ↓. 19; and he

alarm, or of distress: the Turkish translator of the
K thinks that it is originally أَزُلْزِلَ, contracted and
altered in the vowels for the purpose of alleviating
the utterance on account of the straitness of the
time:] but IJ says that a word of four radical
letters does not receive an augmentative like this

distress,” &c.], and of the measure فِعِلْعِلْ. (TA.)
