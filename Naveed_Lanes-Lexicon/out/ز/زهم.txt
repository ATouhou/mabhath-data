its fem. with ة meaning, if an epithet,] signifies
[the same, or] satiated, sated, or satisfied in
stomach; as also ↓ زُهْمَانِىٌّ. (Z, cited by Freytag
in his Arab. Prov., ii. 196.) And [hence, app.,]
زَهْمَانُ, (Abu-n-Nedà, IAar, TA,) or ↓ زُهْمَانُ,
[imperfectly decl. (like the first word) as a proper
name ending with ان] (AHeyth, IDrd, S, TA,)
or each, (K,) the name of A certain dog. (S,
K, &c.) It is said in a prov., زَادُهُ ↓ فِى بَطْنِ زَهْمَانَ
In the belly of the dog زهمان is his provision: applied to a man who has with him his apparatus, and
what he needs: or, accord. to AA, the case was
this: a man slaughtered a camel, and divided it,
and gave to [one whose name was] زهمان his
share, and then زهمان returned to receive again
with the [other] people; and it is applied to a
man who seeks a thing when he has received
once: (Meyd:) Z says that زَهْمَانُ is the name of
a man who came to a people that had slaughtered
a camel, and asked them to give him some food
thereof, and they gave it him: then he returned
to them, and they said to him thus, meaning
“ Thou has had thy provision thereof, and it is in
thy belly; ” and it is applied to any one who has
received his share of a thing, and then come, after
that, seeking it: or, as some relate it, it is with
damm, [↓ زُهْمَان] and is applied to one who is
invited to a repast when he is satiated: or it
relates to one suffering from indigestion: or زهمان
is the name of a dog; and it originated from the
fact that a man prepared for himself some provision, and was unmindful of it, and a dog ate it;
and it is applied to him for whom there is no
share. (Z cited by Freytag ubi suprà.)

زُهُومَةٌ The odour of fat and stinking flesh-meat;
(JK, K; [and mentioned also, but not explained,
in the S;]) as also ↓ زُهْمَةٌ: (K:) or the latter
signifies a fetid odour [in a general sense]: (S:)
but accord. to Az, the former signifies the disagreeableness of odour, without the being fetid,
or altered [for the worse]; such as the odour of
lean flesh-meat, or the odour of the flesh of a beast
of prey, or strong-smelling sea-fish; the fish of the
rivers having no زهومة. (TA.) [See also 1, first
sentence; and رُهْمٌ, last signification; and زَهَمٌ.]
