kesr; (A;) and السَّوِيقَ ↓ تَزَبَّدْتُ. (TA. [Both
these phrases are mentioned together, as though
to indicate that both signify the same: but Ibr D
thinks that the latter means I swallowed the سويق
like as one swallows fresh butter: in my copy of
the A, it is written تَزَبَّدَتِ السَّوِيقُ, which is evidently wrong: perhaps the right reading is تَزَبَّدَ
السَّوِيقُ; and the verb in this phrase, quasi-pass.

↓ زُبْدَةٌ is a more particular term, (S, M, L, Msb,)
meaning a piece, bit, portion, or somewhat, of
زُبْد: (L:) and زُبْدُ اللَّبَنِ signifies also the froth
(رَغْوَة) of milk [if this be not a mistake occasioned
by finding الزُّبْدُ expl. as meaning زَبَدُ اللَّبَنِ instead of زُبْدُ اللَّبَنِ]. (L.) قَدْ صَرَّحَ المَحْضُ عَنِ
الزُّبْدِ [The clear milk has become distinct from

زَبَادٌ [Civet;] a certain perfume, well known:
the lawyers and the lexicologists err in saying
that it is a certain beast, [meaning the civet-cat,]
from which the perfume is milked: (K:) or this
assertion is not to be reckoned as a mistake, the
word being tropically thus applied: so says El-
Karáfee: and Z and other authors worthy of confidence thus apply it [as a coll. gen. n.]: Z also
mentions a saying in which ↓ زَبَادَةٌ is applied [as a
n. un.] to an animal of the kind from which the
perfume is obtained: (TA:) this animal is the
cat, (K,) i. e. the wild cat, which is like the tame,
but longer and larger, and its hair inclines more
to blackness: it is brought from India and Abyssinia: (TA:) the perfume above mentioned is a
fluid, or matter, exuded, (رَشَحٌ, thus in the TA
and in my MS. copy of the K, but in the CK
وَسَخٌ [i. e. dirt],) resembling black viscous dirt,
(TA,) which collects beneath the animal's tail,
upon the anus (المَخْرَج), (K,) and in the inner
sides of the thighs also, as says Ed-Demámeenee:
(TA:) [see also زُهْمٌ:] the beast is taken, and
prevented from struggling, and the said exuded
fluid or matter, or dirt, (رَشَح, or وَسَخ, accord. to
different copies of the K,) collected there, is
scraped off with a piece of the exterior part of a
cane, (K,) or, more commonly, with a spoon,
(TA,) or with a piece of rag, (K,) or a thin
[silver coin such as is called] دِرْهَم. (TA. [Other
accounts of this perfume, which are less correct,
I omit.])

زُبَادٌ, like غُرَابٌ [in measure], Fresh butter
(زُبْد) that has become bad, or spoiled, in the
churning: or, as some say, thin milk. (TA voce
اِخْتَلَطَ, q. v.) [See also زُبَّادُ اللَّبَن, below.]
زَبَادَةٌ: see زَبَادٌ.
زُبَّادُ اللَّبَنِ [The watery part of milk;] that
[part] in which is no good, of milk. (S, K. [See

بِالزُّبَّادِ (S) [The thick milk became mixed with the
thin watery part: or] (tropical:)  the good became mixed
with the bad: relating to a case of difficulty, and
applied to the mixture of truth with falsehood.

-A2-  زُبَّادٌ and ↓ زُبَّادَى A
certain plant, (S, K,) growing in the plains, or
soft land, having broad leaves, and a [pericarp
such as is called] سِنْفَة: it sometimes grows in
hard ground, is eaten by men, and is good, or
pleasant: AHn says that it has small, contracted,
dust-coloured leaves, like those of the مَرْزَنْجُوش,
and its branches, or twigs, spread out: and he
adds, AZ says that the زُبَّاد, as also ↓ زَبَاد, the
latter like سَحَاب [in measure], is of the [kind of
plants called] أَحْرَار [pl. of حُرٌّ, q. v.]: (TA:)
[some say that it is the psyllium. (Freytag's
Lex.) See, again, اِخْتَلَطَ.]
زُبَّادَى: see the next preceding paragraph.
زَابِدٌ Possessing, or a possessor of, زُبْد [or
fresh butter]; (L;) as also ↓ مُزْدَبِدٌ. (K.)
