-b2-  زَنَأَ is also
expl. in the K as signifying خَنَقَ [He throttled,

meaning assigned to this verb below: see 4].
(TA.)

occurs without ء, written زَنَّى, by poetic license,
in a saying of a rájiz cited in art. شدخ, as an ex. of
the word شَادِخَةٌ. (S.) And عَلَيْهِ الحِجَارَةَ ↓ زَنَؤُوا
occurs in a trad. as meaning They made the stones

زَنَآءٌ [A strait, or narrow, place]: and بِئْرٌ زَنَآءٌ [A

that a man is forbidden to pray when he is زنآء;
(S, TA;) or where it is said that the prayer of one
who is ↓ زَانِئ will not be accepted: (Msb:) or the
latter word in this case means one who is ascending
