زيد1
زَادَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. يَزِيدُ, (S,
Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. زِيَادَةٌ (S, A, * Msb, K *) and
زَيْدٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *) with which are syn.
زِيدٌ (S, K) and زَيَدٌ (K) and مَزِيدٌ (S, K) and
زَيْدَانٌ, which last is anomalous, like شَنْآنٌ (K)
and لَيَّانٌ, said to be the only instances of the kind,
(TA,) all as inf. ns., (TK,) and so is مَزَادٌ, (TA,)
and J adds that زُوَادَةٌ is mentioned by Yaakoob,
from Ks, from El-Bekree, as syn. with زِيَادَةٌ, but
this is a mistake, which is unfairly imputed to J
by the author of the K, (MF,) [who says,] as to
الزُّوَادَةُ, it is a mistranscription by J, for the
words are الزُّوَارَةُ and الزِّيَارَةُ, [in the CK الرُّوادةُ
and الرِّيادةُ,] with ر, and without the mention of
[the signification of] النُّمُوُّ, (K, TA,) It (a thing,
S, Mgh, Msb, [as, for ex.,] water, and property,
A) increased, or augmented, or grew; (S, A, TA;)
[and in like manner said of a man, and of any
animal;] as also ↓ اِزْدَادَ: (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K:)
or this latter has a more intensive signification
than the former, like اِكْتَسَبَ in relation to كَسَبَ.
(MF. [See also 5.]) In this sense it has a single
objective complement; as in زَادَ كَذَا It, or he,
increased, or augmented, or grew, in such a thing;
as also ↓ اِزْدَادَ. (TA.) [The latter is more commonly used in this manner.] You say, ↓ اِزْدَدْتُ
مَالًا (A, Mgh, Msb) [I increased in property:
also] meaning I increased to myself, or for myself, property. (Mgh, * Msb.) And الأَمْرُ ↓ ازداد
صُعُوبَةً [The affair increased in difficulty]. (A.)
―
-b2-  [Also It exceeded; it was, or became, redundant, or superfluous; it remained over and above.
And زَادَ عَلَيْهِ It exceeded it; as also ↓ تزايد.]
You say, زَادَ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ ضِعْفَهُ [It exceeded the
thing by the like thereof, or more]. (A.) And
زَادَ عَلَى مَا أَرَادَ [It exceeded what he desired].
(A.) ―
-b3-  Also He gave an addition: so in the
saying, فَقَدْ أَرْبَى ↓ مَنْ زَادَ وَازْدَادَ He who gives an
addition, and who takes it, [each of these] practises usury. (Msb.) ―
-b4-  [And He added, or exaggerated.] يَزِيدُ فِى حَدِيثِهِ [He adds, or exaggerates, in his narration, or talk, or discourse,]
is said of a liar. (A and TA voce سَرَّاجٌ. [See
also 5.])
-A2-  It is also trans.: (Msb:) you say,
زَادَهُ, aor. يَزِيدُهُ, inf. n. زِيَادَةٌ, He increased it, or
augmented it. (L.) And in this sense it is doubly
trans.: (MF:) you say, زَادَهُ اللّٰهُ خَيْرًا, (S, K,) or
مَالًا, (A,) [God increased to him, or added to
him, good fortune or prosperity or the like, or
property; increased, or added to, his good fortune, &c.; or may God increase &c.;] as also
↓ زَيَّدَهُ: (K:) and زَادَ فِيمَا عِنْدَهُ, (S,) or فِى مَالِهِ,
(A,) [He increased, or added to, what he possessed or his possessions, or his property; or may
He (i. e. God) increase &c.] ―
-b2-  زَادَهُ also signifies He gave him an increase, or an addition,
or more. (Msb.) See 10. ―
-b3-  You say also, مَا
يَزِيدُكَ أَحَدٌ عَلَيْهِ [No one is more sufficient for
thee than he]. (K in art. زند. [See 4 in that
art.]) And لَا يَزِيدُكَ عَلَيْهِ جَمَلٌ No camel will
be more sufficient for thee than he; i. q. لَا يَضُرُّكَ.
(ISk, S in art. ضر [in which see other exs.].)
2
زيّد, [inf. n. تَزْيِيدٌ,] said of property, It
increased, or augmented, much. (A.)
-A2-  See
also 1, latter part.
3
زايد أَحَدُ المُتَبَايِعَيْنِ الآخَرَ, inf. n. مُزَايَدَةٌ,
[One of the two persons buying together outbade
the other: see also 6.] (A.)
5
تزيّد It (a price, S, A) was, or became,
excessive, or dear; (S, A, K;) as also ↓ تزايد.
(A, TA.) ―
-b2-  He added, or exaggerated, (MA,)
or lied, (S, MA, K,) in narration, or discourse.
(S, MA. [See also 1, latter half.]) And He
affected to exceed the due bounds in his narration,
or discourse, and his speech; (TA;) he affected
excess in speech, &c.; (K, TA;) i. e. in speech
and in action; (TA;) as also ↓ تزايد: (K:) or
التَّزَيُّدُ فِى الحَدِيثِ means the embellishing narration, or discourse, with lies, and adding in it
what does not belong to it. (Har p. 195.) In the
verse of 'Adee cited in art. زند, the last word is
تَزَيَّدِ as some relate it, or تَزَنَّدِ as others relate it.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  He went a pace exceeding that termed
العَنَق. (S, K. [See also ذَمَلَ, and نَصَبَ السَّيْرَ,
and وَسَجَ.]) And تزيّدت She (A camel) stretched
forth her neck, and went a pace exceeding that
termed العَنَق, as though she were swimming with
her rider?? (A, TA:) and in like manner one
says of a mare, or horse. (TA.) And تزيّدت
الإِبِلُ فِى سَيْرِهَا The camels tasked themselves in
their pace beyond their ability. (TA.)
6
تزايد [It increased, augmented, or grew,
gradually; contr. of تَنَاقَصَ]. See also 1. And
see 5, in two places. تزايدوا عَلَى السِّلْعَةِ [They
bade, one against another, for the commodity, or
article of merchandise, successively raising the
price]: said of the people of a market when a
commodity is sold to him who bids more than
others. (L.) And تزايدوا فِى الثَّمَنِ حَتَّى بَلَغَ مُنْتَهَاهُ
[They augmented the price, one outbidding another,
until it attained its utmost]. (A, TA.)
8
اِزْدَادَ [originally اِزْتَادَ]: see 1, in four places.
―
-b2-  Also He took an addition. (Msb.) See,
again, 1. ―
-b3-  Also He took in addition: so in the
saying, إِذَا ازْدَادَ الرَّاهِنُ دَرَاهِمَ مِنَ المُرْتَهِنِ [When
the pledger takes money in addition from the
receiver of the pledge]. (Mgh.) One says also,
اِزْدَدْ مِنَ الخَيْرِ [Obtain thou, or gain thou, somewhat in addition of what is good: or it may
mean seek thou, or desire thou, an increase, or
addition, of what is good]. (A.) See what next
follows, in two places.
10. استزاد He sought, or desired, or demanded,
an increase, an addition, or more; (A, Mgh,
Msb;) as also ↓ اِزْدَادَ; whence the saying, to a
man to whom a thing has been given, ↓ هَلْ تَزْدَادُ
Dost thou seek, or desire, or demand, more than
what I have given thee? (L.) ―
-b4-  [Hence,] هُوَ
يَسْتَزِيدُ فِى حَدِيثِهِ [He seeks, or desires, to add,
or exaggerate, or to exceed the due bounds, or to
embellish with lies and additions, in his narration,
or discourse]. (A, TA. [See also 5.]) ―
-b5-  استزادهُ
He sought, or desired, or demanded, of him an
increase, an addition, or more. (Msb, K.) You
say, ↓ لَوِ اسْتَزَدْتُهُ لَزَادَنِى If I had sought, or desired,
or demanded, an increase, &c., he had given me
an increase, &c. (Msb.) ―
-b6-  [And hence,] (tropical:)  He
reckoned him, or held him, to have fallen short of
doing what he ought to have done, (S, A, K,
TA,) and complained of him, (A, TA,) or reproved him, for a thing that he did not approve.
(TA.) And كَتَبَ إِلَيْهِ كِتَابَ اسْتِزَادَةٍ (tropical:)  [He wrote
to him a letter of complaint, or reproof, for his
having fallen short, &c.; requiring him to do
more]. (A.)
زَيْدٌ an inf. n. of زَادَ. (S, Mgh, Msb.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] هُمْ زَيْدٌ عَلَى مِائَةٍ (S, A, L) and ↓ زِيدٌ
(S, L) and ↓ زِياَدَةٌ (A) (tropical:)  [They are more than a
hundred].
زِيدٌ an inf. n. of زَادَ. (S, * K, * TK.) ―
-b2-  See
the next preceding paragraph.
زِيَادَةٌ an inf. n. of زَادَ. (S, Msb.) Using it as
an inf. n., (Msb,) you say, اِفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ زِيَادَةً [meaning Do thou that in addition]: (S, Msb:) the
vulgar say ↓ زَائِدَةً, (S,) which one should not say.
(Msb.) [Hence also,] حُرُوفُ الزِّيَادَةِ [The letters
of augmentation; or the augmentative letters;
i. e. the letters that are added to the radical
letters in Arabic words]: they are ten, and are
comprised in the saying, سَأَلْتُمُونِيهَا [“ Ye asked
me for them ”], (TA,) and in أَلْيَوْمَ تَنْسَاهُ [“ Today thou wilt forget it ”]; (K, TA;) and more
than a hundred and thirty other combinations
comprising them have been mentioned: (MF:)
[these letters are also called زَوَائِدُ, of which the
sing. is ↓ زَائِدَةٌ.] See also زَيْدٌ. ―
-b2-  [As a simple
subst., or a subst. properly so termed, it signifies
An increase, or increment; and augmentation, or
augment; an addition, additament, adjunct, or
accessory: an accession: excess, redundance, or
superfluity: and a redundant part or portion or
appertenance; a surplus; a residue: an excrescence: pl. زِيَادَاتٌ and زَيائِدُ. ―
-b3-  Hence,] إِبِلٌ
كَثِيرَةُ الزَّيَائِدِ i.e. الزِّيَادَات [Camels having much
increase; lit., much, or many, increases]. (K.)
A poet says,
بِهَجْمَةٍ تَمْلَأُ عَيْنَ الحَاسِدِ
ذَاتِ سُرُوحٍ جَمَّةِ الزَّيَائِدِ
[With a herd of forty or more camels, that fill,
or glut, the eye of the envier, enjoying pasturing
by themselves, having much increase]: some say,
[in citing this verse,] الزَّوَائِدِ, which is pl. of ↓ زَائِدَةٌ;
but الزوائد is said only in relation to the legs of a
beast. (L.) ―
-b4-  [Hence also,] زِيَادَةُ الكَبِدِ, (so in
a copy of the S, and in the A and L, and in
several places in the K,) or الكَبِدِ ↓ زَائِدَةُ, (so
termed by Zj, and so in the T, and in two copies
of the S, and in the L,) both of which are correct,
(TA,) [The redundant appertenance of the liver;]
a certain small piece to which the liver is attached,
or suspended: (Zj, in his “ Khalk el-Insán: ”)
or a certain small appertenance of the liver
(هُنَيَّةٌ مِنْهَا صَغِيرَةٌ), at its side, going away from it
(مُتَنَحِّيَةٌ عَنْهَا): (S, L:) or a certain piece appended,
or attached, to the liver (مُعَلَّقَةٌ بِهَا): (A:) or a
certain appendage of the liver; [so I render هَنَةٌ
مُتَعَلِّقَةٌ مِنْهَا, agreeably with the next preceding
explanation; though it may be rendered a thing
suspended from it, i.e. from the liver; or the
right reading may be هنة متعلّقة بِهَا, which is
virtually the same as the explanation in the A,
and agreeable with what here follows: so called]
because it is a redundance (تَزِيدُ) upon its upper
surface: (L:) [all of these explanations seem to
denote the round ligament of the liver: the Hebrew
יֹחֶרֶח הַכּבֵד, in Ex. xxix. 22, literally signifies the same; like the slightly-varying appellations in Ex. xxix. 13 and Lev. iii. 4, and Lev.
ix. 10: but the real meaning thereof is much
disputed: the rendering of the LXX. is lobo\s tou*
h>/patos; which is said to mean extrema pars
hepatis: that of the Vulg., reticulum hepatis:
that of our authorized Engl. Vers., the caul above
the liver; (with this marginal note: “ it seemeth
by anatomy, and the Hebrew Doctors, to be the
midriff: ”) and it is remarkable that this is one
of the meanings assigned to الخِلْبُ, which some
hold to be syn. with زَيَادَةُ الكَبِدِ: (see خِلْبٌ:)
Bochart (in his Hieroz. t. i., p. 498, seq.,) and
Gesenius (in his Lex.) explain the Hebrew term
as meaning the greater lobe of the liver: but this
is hard to reconcile with the Hebrew or the
Arabic; and utterly irreconcileable with the explanations given by the Arabs; among whom, it
should be observed, were many of the Jewish
religion, who cannot reasonably be supposed to
have not known the correct meaning of a term
relating to their sacrifices:] the pl. of زيادة is
زَيَائِدُ, (L,) and that of ↓ زائدة is زَوَائِدُ. (S, L.)
Hence the saying, الوَلَدُ كَبِدُ ذِى الوَلَدِ وَوَلَدُ الوَلَدِ
زِيَادَةُ الكَبِدِ [The child is as the liver of the parent,
and the grandchild is as the redundant appertenance of the liver]. (A, TA.)
زَائِدٌ act. part. n. of زَادَ, (Msb,) [Increasing,
augmenting, or growing. ―
-b2-  Exceeding; in excess; redundant; superfluous; remaining over
and above: excrescent: additional; in addition;
adscititious.] You say, أَخَذْتُهُ بِدِرْهَمٍ فَزَائِدًا [I
took it, i. e. bought it, for a dirhem and more].
(A.) [See also the next paragraph.]
زَائِدَةٌ [fem. of زَائِدٌ: and also a subst.; being
transferred from the category of epithets to that
of substs. by the affix ة: pl. زَوَائِدُ]: see زِيَادَةٌ, in
five places. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] الزَّوَائِدُ [Certain excrescences, or pendent hairs, termed] زَمَعَات, in the
hinder part of the kind leg or foot. (K. [In the
explanations there given, I read الرِّجْل, as in one
copy, instead of الرَّحْل. It has been stated above,
voce زِيَادَةٌ, on the authority of the L, that الزَّوَائِد
is said only in relation to the legs of a beast.]) ―
-b3-
[But] ذُو الزَّوَائِدِ means The lion: (S, K:) by the
زوائد being mean this claws and his canine teeth and
his roaring and his impetuosity. (S.) ―
-b4-  زَائِدَةُ السَّاقِ
The shin-bone. (L.)
[
زَوَائِدِىٌّ a rel. n. from زَوَائِدُ pl. of زَائِدَةٌ; and
used, app., as meaning Having something redundant; for] Sa'eed Ibn-'Othmán was surnamed
الزَّوَائِدِىُّ because he had three بَيْضَات: so they
assert. (S.)
بُرُودٌ تَزِيدِيَّةٌ, (S, K,) and تَزِيدِيَّاتٌ [alone], (S,)
[Garments of the kind termed] بُرُود having in
them red stripes, (S, K,) to which streaks of
blood are likened: (S:) so called in relation to
تَزِيد the son of حُلْوَان, the father of a tribe: (S,
K:) or, as some say, تَزِيد the son of حَيْدَان:
(MF:) or from تَزِيد, a city, or town, of ElYemen, in which such برود were woven: (TA:)
or, accord. to some, J and F are in error; and the
truth is, that there were some merchants in Mekkeh, called بَنُو يَزِيدٍ, thus with ى and in relation
to them certain [camel-vehicles for women of the
kind called] هَوَادِج were termed ↓ يَزِيدِيَّةٌ. (MF.)
مَزَادٌ: see مَزَادَةٌ, in two places.
مَزِيدٌ an inf. n. of زَادَ. (S, K.) You say, لَا
مَزِيدَ عَلَى مَا فَعَلْتَ and ↓ لَا مُسْتَزَادَ, (A, Msb,)
both meaning the same [i.e. There is no exceeding what thou hast done: or rather the latter
means there is no desire for more than thou hast
done, or there is no one of whom is desired more
than thou hast done; for ↓ مُسْتَزَاد may be here
an inf. n., and it may be a pass. part. n.]. (Msb.)
-A2-  [It is also the pass. part. n. of زَادَ, signifying
Increased, or augmented; as also مَزِيدٌ فِيهِ.]
مَزَادَةٌ [A leathern water-bag, one of a pair
which is borne by a camel or other beast;] the
half (شَطْر) of a رَاوِيَة: (Msb in art. زود:) [a
water-bag of this kind is represented in a sketch
of “ Sakkàs ” in my work on the Modern Egyptians:] it has two loops, and two kidney-shaped
pieces of leather (كُلْيَتَانِ), the former of which
are sewed to the latter: (TA voce خُرْبَةٌ:) the
رَاوِيَة consists of two mezádehs (مَزَادَتَانِ), which
are bound upon the two sides of the camel with
the [cord called] رِوَآء: the pl. is مَزَايِدُ [often
written مَزَائِدُ]; and sometimes the Arabs elided
the ة, saying ↓ مَزَادٌ: (T, TA:) [both of these
forms are mentioned in the S and K as pls.:] and
↓ مَزَادٌ without ة, is [also] applied to the single
one (فَرْدَة [meaning the single water-skin]) which
the rider attaches behind his camel's saddle, having
no عَزْلَآء, [or spout (which is closed by means of a
thong tied round it) at one of the lower extremities for pouring out the water; thus] differing
from the مَزَادَة: (T, TA:) or the مزادة is a رَاوِيَة,
[app. accord. to some who applied this latter term
to a single water-bag,] (S, A, K,) or only (K)
such as is composed of two skins with a third
inserted between them to widen it: (A 'Obeyd, S,
M, A, K:) and so are the سَطِيحَة and the شَعِيب:
(A 'Obeyd, S:) or the سَطيحة is made of two
skins put face to face; and the مزادة is of two
skins and a half, or of three skins: (ISh, TA:)
or it is [a water-bag] joined (مَشْعُربَة) at one side;
if consisting of two faces (ان خرجت من وجهين
[i. e. of two pieces of skin whereof each forms one
face or side]) it is called a شَعِيب: or it is like a
راوية having no عَزْلَآء [expl. above]: AM and the
author of the Msb and some others assert that its
medial radical letter is و, and that it is from
الزَّوْدُ, (TA,) being so called because one furnishes himself with water in it for travellingprovision: (Msb in art. زود:) but this is a mistake: (TA:) it is thus called because it is
enlarged by the addition of a third skin: (AO,
El-Khafájee, TA:) [Fei says that] accord. to
analogy it should be مِزَادَةٌ. (Msb in art. زود.)
مُسْتَزَادٌ: see مَزِيدٌ, in two places.
يَزِيدِيَّةٌ, applied to هَوَادِج: see تَزِيدِيَّةٌ.
