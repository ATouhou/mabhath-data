زعم1
زَعَمَ, (S, Msb,) aor.
زَعُمَ, (Msb, MS, JM, [not
mentioned in the S nor in the K, app. because
well known,]) inf. n. زَعْمٌ and زُعْمٌ and زعْمٌ, (S,
Msb, K,) the first of the dial. of El-Hijáz, (Msb,
TA,) the second of the dial. of [the tribe of] Asad,
(Msb,) or Benoo-Temeem, (TA,) and the third
of the dial. of some of [the tribe of] Keys; (Msb;)
[generally best rendered He asserted; for it mostly
relates to a thing not certainly known: or] he
said; (S, Msb, K;) as in the phrases زَعَمَتِ
الحَنَفِيَّةٌ [The Hanafees said or asserted, or have
said or asserted,] and زَعَمَ سِيبَوَيْهِ [Seebaweyh said
or asserted, or has said or asserted]; (Msb;)
[and زَعَمَ أَنَّهُ كَذَا He said, or asserted, that it
was thus;] either truly or falsely: (K:) mostly
used in relation to a thing respecting which there
is doubt, (Sh, Az, Msb, K,) and which is not
certainly known: (Sh, Az, Msb:) or it is mostly
used in relation to that which is false, or that
respecting which there is doubt, or suspicion:
(El-Marzookee, Msb:) or, as those skilled in the
language of the Arabs say, in relation to a thing
of which the speaker doubts, and does not know
whether it may not be false: (Lth:) or زَعَمَ زَعْمًا
means he related a piece of information not knowing whether it were true or false. (IKoot, Msb.)
Hence the saying, زَعَمَ مَطِيَّةُ الكَذِبِ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  زَعَمَ is
the conveyer, or vehicle, (properly the camel, or
beast, that serves as the conveyer,) of lying]. (Msb.)
It is said in a trad., بِئْسَ مَطِيَّةُ الرَّجُلِ زَعَمُوا [(assumed tropical:)  Very
evil, or bad, is the man's conveyer زَعَمُوا]: i. e.,
when a man desires to journey to a country, or
town, he mounts his camel, or beast, that serves
to convey him, and journeys until he accomplishes the object of his want: therefore, that
with which the speaker prefaces his speech, and
by means of which he attains the object of his
desire, when he says زَعَمُوا كَذَا وَكَذَا, is likened
to the camel, or beast, by means of which he
attains the object of want: for زَعَمُوا is [generally]
said only in the case of a narration that has no
authority whereon to rest, and that contains no
proof. (TA.) IKh says that الزَّعْمُ is used in relation to that which is discommended; and that its
primary signification is said by some of the expositors of the Kur-án to be The act of lying:
(TA: [this signification is also given in the K,
as being contr. to the first:]) some say that it is
metonymically used in this sense: (Msb:) and
it is expl. as having this meaning in the Kur
[vi. 137], where it is said, فَقَالُوا هٰذَا لِلّٰهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ,
i. e. [And they have said, “This belongeth unto
God,”] with their lying. (Lth, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Sometimes] زَعَمَهُ signifies He described him, or it.
(Har p. 204.) ―
-b3-  And sometimes زَعَمَ signifies
He promised: whence the saying of ' Amr Ibn-Sha-s,
تَقُولُ هَلَكْنَا إِنْ هَلَكْتَ وَإِنَّمَا
عَلَىاللّٰهُ أَرْزَاقُ العِبَادِ كَمَا زَعَمْ
[Thou sayest, or she says, “We perish if thou
perish: ” but verily upon God lie the means of
subsistence of mankind, i. e. it lies upon Him to
supply these, as He has promised]. (TA.) ―
-b4-
الزَّعْمُ is used also in the sense of الظَّنُّ: (Msb,
TA:) one says, فِى زَعْمِى كَذَا [In my opinion
it is thus]. (Msb.) [Hence, likewise,] زَعَمْتَنِى
كَذَا, (K,) aor. تَزْعُمُنِى, (TA,) Thou thoughtest
me to be thus. (K, TA.) Aboo-Dhu-eyb says,
فَإِنْ تُزْعُمِينِى كُنْتُ أَجْهَلُ فِيكُمُ
فَإِنِّى شَرَيْتُ الحِلْمَ بَعْدَكِ بِالجَهْلِ
[And if thou think me such that I used to be
ignorant, or to act ignorantly, among you, know
that I have purchased intelligence since I was
with thee (بَعْدَكِ being for بَعْدَ عَهْدِى بِكِ) in exchange for ignorance]. (TA. [The meaning of
تزعمينى is there indicated by the context.]) ―
-b5-  It
is also used in the sense of الاِعْتِقَادُ: whence the
saying in the Kur [lxiv. 7], زَعَمَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُو أَنْ
لَنْ يُبْعَثُوا [They who have disbelieved our revelations have believed, or firmly believed, that they
shall not be raised from the dead]. (Msb.) ―
-b6-
Sometimes, also, زَعَمَ is used in the sense of شَهِدَ:
as in the saying of En-Nábighah,
زَعَمَ الهُمَامُ بِأَنَّ فَاهَا بَارِدٌ
[app. meaning The magnanimous chief bore witness that her mouth was cool]. (TA.)

says, ↓ زَعِمَ فُلَانٌ فِى غَيْرِ مَزْعَمٍ, i. e. طَمِعَ فى غَيْرِ
مَطْعَمٍ [Such a one coveted a thing not to be
coveted; meaning, a thing of which the attainment was remote, or improbable: see art. طمع].
(TA.) And ' Antarah says,
عُلِّقْتُهَا عَرَضًا وَأَقْتُلُ قَوْمَهَا
زَعَمًا لَعَمْرُ أَبِيكَ لَيْسَ بِمَزْعَمِ
(S,) i. e. I became enamoured of her unintentionally, [or accidentally,] while I was slaying her
people; eagerly desiring her love: by the life of
thy father, I swear, this is not a [fit] occasion
for eager desire: i. e. I can not attain to holding
communion of love with thee, [or with her,] any
day, while there is this conflict and hostility between the two tribes: (EM p. 222:) لَيْسَ بِمَزْعَمٍ
meaning لَيْسَ بِمَطْمَعٍ : (S:) or, [as some relate it,]
زَعْمًا وَرَبِّ البَيْتِ لَيْسَ بِمَزْعَمِ
[eagerly desiring: by the Lord of the House (i. e.
the Kaabeh), &c.]. (TA. [زَعْمًا is there expressly
said to be thus: but the measure does not require
its being so.])

ambiguous) in this sense and the first mentioned

5
تزعّم i. q. تَكَذَّبَ [q. v.]: (S, K:) [it seems

[app. meaning O thou asserter of that which thou
hast spoken falsely]. (TA. [This hemistich is
there cited as an ex. of تزعّم as expl. in the K;
and I find no other explanation of this verb.])
6
تَزَاعَمَا They two competed in discoursing of
a thing, and differed respecting it: accord. to Z,
it means they talked of, or related, زَعَمَات, i. e.
[mere assertions, or] stories in which no confidence was to be placed. (TA.) Sh says that
التَّزَاعُمُ is mostly used in relation to a thing respecting which there is doubt. (TA.)
-A2-  One
says also, تزاعم القَوْمُ, meaning The people, or
party, became responsible, one for another: and
hence, تزاعموا عَلَى كَذَا they leagued together,
and aided one another, against such a thing. (TA.)
زُعْمٌ [originally an inf. n. of زَعَمَ, like زَعْمٌ and
زِعْمٌ,] is a word used by the vulgar as meaning
كِبْرٌ [i. e. Pride; and, as often used in the present
day, pretension: because implying false, or vain,
assertion]. (TA.)

زَعَمَاتِكَ [meaning This I think, and I think not
to be true thine assertion and thine assertions];
أَتَوَهَّمُ being understood after لا : these words are
used as meaning the rejection of what has been
said by the person to whom they are addressed.
(K, TA. [In the CK, erroneously, زَعْمَتِكَ and
زَعْمَاتِكَ.]) They said also, زَعْمَةٌ صَادِقَةٌ لَآتِيَنَّكَ [i. e.
It is a true assertion: I will assuredly come to
thee]; using the nom. case : though they said,
يَمِينًا صَادِقَةً لَأَفْعَلَنَّ [i. e. I swear “ a true oath :
I will assuredly do ” such a thing]; using the
accus. case. (Ks, TA.) And one says, تَحَادَثَا
بِالزَّعَمَاتِ, meaning They two talked of, or related,
each to the other, [mere assertions, or] stories in
which no confidence was to be placed. (Z, TA.)
زُعْمِىٌّ (with damm, TA) Mendacious: and
veracious: (K:) thus bearing two contr. significations. (TA.)
زُعْمُومٌ : see the next paragraph.
زَعُومٌ, a fem. epithet, (S, K, &c.,) applied to a
she-camel, and to a sheep or goat, Of which one
doubts whether there be in her fat or not, (S, K,)
and which is therefore felt with the hands, in
order that one may know if she be fat or lean:
(S:) or a sheep or goat of which one knows not
whether there be in her fat or not: (As, TA:)
or, as some say, of which men assert that there
is in her marrow. (TA.) And, as a fem. epithet,
Having little fat: and having much fat: thus
bearing two contr. senses: as also ↓مُزْعَمَةٌ [app.
in both senses]: (M, K:) and ↓مَزْعُومَةٌ also
signifies having little fat; of which people, when
they eat of her, say to her owner, “Didst thou
assert her to be fat? ” applied to a she-camel.
(TA.)
-A2-  Also Impotent in speech; (K;) and so
↓زُعْمُومٌ. (S, * K.)
زَعِيمٌ Responsible, answerable, amenable, surety,
or guarantee. (S, Msb, K.) Hence, in the Kur
[xii. 72], وَأَنَا بِهِ زَعِيمٌ [And I am responsible for
it]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also The chief, lord, master, or
prince, or a people; (Msb, K;) or [in the CK
“ and ”] their spokesman: (K:) their chief is thus

this sense:] thus expl. by IAar as occurring in
the following verse of Lebeed: (TA:)
وَوِتْرًا وَالزَّعَامَةُ لِلْغُلَامِ  تَطِيرُ عَدَائِدُ الأَشْرَاكِ شَفْعًا
(S and TA in the present art. and in art. عد)
[The portions of inheritance of the sharers fly
away, two together and singly; but the chiefdom
is for the boy]: by his saying شَفْعًا وَوِتْرًا, he
means that the male's share of inheritance is like
that of two females [so that he has two portions
when the female has one]: but other explanations, those here following, are given of الزعامة
as used in this verse. (TA. [See also عَدِيدَةٌ.])
―
-b3-  A weapon, or weapons; syn. سِلَاحٌ. (S, K.)
So, accord. to J, in the verse of Lebeed: for, he
says, they used, when they divided the inheritance, to give the weapon, or weapons, to the son,
exclusively of the daughter. (TA.) ―
-b4-  A coat of
mail: (K:) or coats of mail: and thus it is
expl. by IAar as used in the verse of Lebeed.
(TA.) ―
-b5-  The chief's share of spoil. (K.) ―

And The best and most of the property of an
inheritance and the like: (K:) and thus, also, it

ox-kind; [probably meaning one of the wild
species;] syn. بَقَرَةٌ. (K.)
زَعَّامَةٌ: see the next preceding sentence.
مَزْعَمٌ A thing, or an affair, -in which no confidence is to be placed; (S, K;) this saying, or
asserting, it to be thus, and this saying, or asserting, it to be thus: (S:) [pl. مَزَاعِمُ.] One says,
فِى قَوْلِهِ مَزَاعِمُ (S, TA) i. e. [In his saying are
things in which no confidence is to be placed; or]
no confidence is to be placed in his saying. (TA.)
And هٰذَا أَمْرٌ فِيهِ مَزَاعِمُ This is an affair that is
not right; (TA;) [wherein are things] respecting
which there is dispute. (K, TA.) And زَعَمَ غَيْرَ
مَزْعَمٍ He said that which was not good, or right,
or just; and asserted what was impossible. (Msb.)
-A2-  Also A thing that is, or is to be, coveted, or

a mistranscription for فِيهِ مَزَاعِمُ. See مَزْعَمٌ.])
