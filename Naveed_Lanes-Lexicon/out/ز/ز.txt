زalphabetical letter
ز
The eleventh letter of the alphabet; commonly
called زَاىٌ, and sometimes زَآءٌ, [and زًا, and زَا,
(see زَاىٌ in art. زوى,)] and زَىٌّ, and زَىْ. (MF.)
It is one of the letters termed مَجْهُورَة [or vocal,
i. e. pronounced with the voice, and not with the
breath only]; and of the letters termed أَسِلَيَّة,
because proceeding from the tip of the tongue.
(TA.) Az says that it is not conjoined with ص
in any Arabic word. (TA.) It is substituted for
س and for ص; as in يَزْدِلُ for يَسْدِلُ, and يَزْدُقُ
for يَصْدُقُ: and in the Tes-heel it is said that it is
sometimes interchanged [with س] after ج, as in
جُسْتُ خِلَالَ الدِّيَارِ for جُزْتُ; and after ر, as in
رَسَبَ and رَزَبَ: which interchange, accord. to MF,
is said to be of the dial. of Kelb; or, as Et-Toosee
says, of the dial. of 'Odhrah and Kaab and Benul-' Ambar. (TA.)
-A2-  [As a numeral, ز denotes
Seven.]
