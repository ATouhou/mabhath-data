زلغبQ. 4
اِزْلَغَبَّ, said of a young bird, Its feathers
came forth: (S in art. زغب, and K:) or its
feathers began to come forth, (Lth, TA,) before
their becoming black. (TA.) Also said of plumage, It began to come forth. (Lth, TA.) And
said of hair, (S in art. زغب, and K,) as also
ازلعبّ, (TA,) It grew forth after having been
shaven: (S, K:) it began to grow forth, soft:
and said of the hair of an old man, i. q. اِزْغَابَّ [it
was, or became, downy]. (TA.) Accord. to the
S, and AHei and IKtt and others, it belongs to
art. زغب, like as اِزْلَعَبَّ is held by them to belong
to art. زعب; but accord. to the K, the ل is radical,
and therefore this is its proper place. (TA.)
