زين1
زَانَهُ, (S, MA, Msb, K,) aor. يَزِينُهُ, (Msb,)
inf. n. زَيْنٌ; (MA, Msb, KL, TA;) and ↓ زيّنهُ,
(S, MA, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَزْيِينٌ; (Msb, KL,
TA;) and ↓ أَزَانَهُ, (Msb, K,) and ↓ أَزْيَنَهُ, (K,)
which is its original form, (TA,) inf. n. إِزَانَةٌ;
(Msb;) signify the same; (S, MA, Msb, K;)
He, or it, adorned, ornamented, decorated,
decked, bedecked, garnished, embellished, beautified, or graced, him, or it. (MA, KL, PS: [and
the like is indicated in the S and Msb and K.])
[زَانَهُ said of a quality, and of an action, and of a
saying, is best rendered It adorned him, or
graced him, or was an honour to him; contr. of
شَانَهُ; as is indicated in the S and K: and sometimes means it was his pride: and ↓ زيّنهُ means
as expl. above: and he embellished it, dressed it
up, or trimmed it; said in this sense as relating
to language: and he embellished it, or dressed it
up, namely, an action &c. to another (لِغَيْرِهِ);
often said in this sense of the Devil; (as in the
Kur vi. 43, &c.;) i. e. he commended it to him:]
زَانَهُ كَذَا and ↓ زيّنهُ [Such a thing adorned him,
&c.,] are expl. as said when one's excellence
[فَضْلُهُ, as I read for فعله, an evident mistranscription,] appears either by speech or by action:
and اللّٰهِ لِلْأَشْيَآءِ ↓ تَزْيِينُ [God's adorning, &c., of
things] is sometimes by means of his creating
them مُزَيَّنَة [i. e. adorned, &c.]; and النَّاسِ ↓ تَزْيِينُ
[The adorning, &c., of men], by their abundance
of property, and by their speech, i. e. by their
extolling Him. (Er-Rághib, TA.) One says,
زَانَهُ الحُسْنُ [Beauty adorned, or graced, him, or
it]. And Mejnoon says,
فَيَا رَبِّ إِذْ صَيَّرْتَ لَيْلَى لِىَ الهَوَى
فَزِنِّى لِعَيْنَيْهَا كَمَا زِنْتَهَا لِيَا
[And, O my Lord, since Thou hast made Leylà
to be to me the object of love, then grace Thou me
to her eyes like as Thou hast graced her to me].
(S, TA: but in the former, مِنَ الهَوى in the place
of لِىَ الهَوَى. [The reading in the S means of the
objects of love: for هَوًى, being originally an
inf. n., may be used alike as sing. and pl.])
السِّلْعَةِ فِى البَيْعِ ↓ تَزْيِينُ [means The setting off,
or commending, of a commodity in selling; and]
is allowed, if without concealment of a fault, or
defect, from the purchaser, and without lying in
the attribution and description of the article.
(TA.)

تزيّن and ↓ اِزْدَانَ, (S, K,) the latter of the
measure اِفْتَعَلَ, [originally اِزْتَيَنَ, and then اِزْتَانَ,]
(S,) quasi-pass. verbs, [the former of زَيَّنَهُ and
the latter of زَانَهُ,] (K,) signify the same; (S;)
[He, or it, was, or became, adorned, ornamented,
decorated, decked, bedecked, garnished, embel-lished, beautified, or graced;] as also اِزَّيَّنَ, (S, *
K,) [a variation of the first, being] originally
تَزَيَّنَ, the ت being made quiescent, and incorporated into the ز, and the ا being prefixed in order
that the inception may be perfect; (S, TA;)
and ↓ ازيانّ; and ↓ ازينّ. (K.) One says, ↓ أَزْيَنَتِ
الأَرْضُ بِعُشْبِهَا [perhaps a mistranscription for
↓ اِزْيَنَّتِ The earth, or land, became adorned,
&c., with, or by, its herbage]; as also اِزَّيَّنَت,
originally تَزَيَّنَت [as expl. above]; (S;) and
some, in the Kur x. 25, read تَزَيَّنَت; and some,
↓ ازيانّت. (Bd.) And they said, إِذَا طَلَعَتِ الجَبْهَةُ
تَزَيَّنَتِ النَّخْلَةُ [When الجبهة (the Tenth Mansion
of the Moon) rises aurorally, the palm-tree
becomes garnished with ripening dates: that
Mansion thus rose in central Arabia, about the
commencement of the era of the Flight, on the
12th of August, O. S; and in that region, at, or
soon after, that period, the dates begin to ripen].
(TA.) [تزيّن is said of language, as meaning It
was embellished, dressed up, or trimmed: and of
an action &c., as meaning it was embellished, or
dressed up, i. e. commended, to a person, by
another man, and, more commonly, by the
Devil.] ―
-b2-  And تزيّن also signifies He adorned,
ornamented, decorated, decked, &c., himself.
(MA, KL.) [Hence,] تزيّن بِالبَاطِلِ [He invested himself with that which did not belong to
him]. (S and TA in art. شبع.)

11
إِزْيَاْنَّ see 5, each in two places.
زَانٌ: see art. زون.
زَيْنٌ [as an inf. n., and also as a simple subst.,]
is the contr. of شَيْنٌ: (S, Msb, K:) [as a simple
subst.,] i. q. زِينَةٌ, q. v.: (Har p. 139:) [and
commonly signifying A grace; a beauty; a
comely quality; a physical, and also an intel-lectual, adornment; an honour, or a credit; and
anything that is the pride, or glory, of a person
or thing: in these senses contr. of شَيْنٌ:] pl. أَزْيَانٌ.
(K.) ―
-b2-  Az says, I heard a boy of [the tribe
called] Benoo- 'Okeyl say to another, وَجْهِى زَيْنٌ
وَوَجْهُكَ شَيْنٌ, meaning My face is comely and thy
face is ugly; for وَجْهِى ذُو زَيْنٍ وَوَجْهُكَ ذُو شَيْنٍ
[my face is possessed of comeliness and thy face
is possessed of ugliness]; using the inf. ns. as
epithets; like as one says رَجُلٌ صَوْمٌ and عَدْلٌ.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  Also The comb of the cock. (S.)
زَانَةٌ [mentioned in this art. in the K]: see art.
زون.
زِينَةٌ, the subst. from زَانَهُ, (Msb,) signifies
مَا يُتَزَيَّنُ بِهِ [i. e. A thing with which, or by which,
one is adorned, ornamented, decorated, decked,
bedecked, garnished, embellished, beautified, or
graced; or with which, or by which, one adorns,
&c., himself]; (T, S, K;) any such thing; (T,
TA;) [any ornament, ornature, decoration, garnish, embellishment, or grace;] and so ↓ زِيانٌ;
(K;) and ↓ زَيْنٌ, also, [which see above,] signifies
the same as زِينَةٌ: (Har p. 139:) accord. to El-
Harállee, زِينَةٌ denotes the [means of] beautifying,
or embellishing, a thing by another thing; consisting of apparel, or an ornament of gold or
silver or of jewels or gems, or aspect: or, as some
say, it is the beauty [seen] of the eye that does
not reach to the interior of that which is adorned
[thereby]: accord. to Er-Rághib, its proper mean-
ing is a thing that does not disgrace, or render
unseemly, a man, in any of his states or conditions,
either in the present world or in that which is to
come: but that which adorns him in one state or
condition, exclusively of another, is in one point
of view شَيْنٌ: summarily speaking, it is of three
kinds; namely, mental, such as knowledge or
science, and good tenets; and bodily, such as
strength, and tallness of stature, and beauty of
aspect; and extrinsic, such as wealth, and rank
or station or dignity; and all these are mentioned
in the Kur: (TA:) the pl. is زِيَنٌ. (Bd in x. 25.)
زِينَةُ الحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا [or simply زِينَةُ الدُّنْيَا generally
means The ornature, finery, show, pomp, or
gaiety, of the present life or world; and] particularly includes wealth and children. (Kur
xviii. 44.) زِينَةُ الأَرْضِ [The ornature of the
earth] means the plants, or herbage, of the earth.
(TA.) يَوْمُ الزِّينَةِ [The day of ornature] is the
festival (العِيدُ); (S, K;) when men used [and
still use] to adorn themselves with goodly articles
of apparel. (TA.) And also The day of the
breaking [of the dam a little within the entrance]
of the canal of Misr [here meaning the present
capital of Egypt, El-Káhireh, which we call
“ Cairo ”], (K, TA,) i. e. the canal which runs
through the midst of Misr, and [the dam of]
which is broken when the Nile has attained the
height of sixteen cubits or more: this day is said
to be meant in the Kur xx. 61: it is one of the
days observed in Egypt with the greatest gladness
and rejoicing from ancient times; and its observance in the days of the Fátimees was such as is
inconceivable, as it is described in the “ Khitat ”
of El-Makreezee. (TA. [The modern observances
of this day, and of other days in relation to the
rise of the Nile, are described in my work on the
Modern Egyptians.])
قَمَرٌ زَيَانٌ A beautiful moon. (K.)

-b2-  [Also,] applied to a man,
Having his hair trimmed, or clipped, [or shaven,
by the مُزَيِّن.] (S, TA.)
مُزَيِّنٌ i. q. حَجَّامٌ [i. e. A cupper; who is
generally a barber; and to the latter this epithet
(مُزَيِّنٌ) is now commonly applied; as it is also
in the MA]. (S, TA.)
-A2-  See also مُتَزَيِّنٌ.
مُزَيِّينٌ: see مُتَزَيِّنٌ.
مُزَّانٌ: see each in two places in what
follows.
مُزْدَانٌ: see each in two places in what
follows.
مُتَزَيِّنٌ and ↓ مُزْدَانٌ and ↓ مُزَّانٌ signify the same
[i. e. Adorned, ornamented, decorated, decked,
bedecked, garnished, embellished, or graced; as
also ↓ مُزَيَّنٌ: and the first signifies also selfadorned &c.]: (TA:) the second and third are
part. ns. of اِزْدَانَ; the third being formed from
the second by incorporation [of the د into the ز]:
and the dim. of مُزْدَانٌ is ↓ مُزَيِّنٌ, like مُخَيِّرٌ the
dim. of مُخْتَارٌ; and if you substitute [for the د],
↓ مُزَيِّينٌ: and in like manner in forming the pl.
you say مَزَايِنُ and مَزَايِينُ. (S.) You say, أَنَا
بِإِعْلَامِكَ ↓ مُزَّانٌ and ↓ مُزْدَانٌ, meaning مُتَزَيِّنٌ
بِإِعْلَامِ أَمْرِكَ [i. e. I am graced by the making
known of thy command, or affair]. (TA.) And
↓ اِمْرَأَةٌ زَائِنٌ means مُتَزَيِّنَةٌ [i. e. A woman adorned,
&c.; or self-adorned &c.]: (K, TA:) in [some
of] the copies of the K, erroneously, مُتَزَيِّنٌ.
(TA.)
