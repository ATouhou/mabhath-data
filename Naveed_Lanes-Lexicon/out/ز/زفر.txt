زفر1
زَفَرَ, aor.
زَفِرَ, (S, K,) inf. n. زَفِيرٌ (S, A, K) and
رَفْرٌ (K) and إِزْفِيرٌ, (M, [like إِرْزِيزٌ, app. an inf. n.,
or perhaps a simple subst.,]) He drew in his
breath to the utmost, by reason of distress: (S:)
it originally signifies he drew back his breath
vehemently, so that his ribs became swollen out:
(Er-Rághib:) زَفِيرٌ is the beginning of the cry of
the ass, (Lth, S, A, Er-Rághib,) and of the like,
(Lth,) and is generally used in this sense; (Er-Rághib;) and شَهِيقٌ is the ending thereof; (Lth,
S, A, Er-Rághib;) for the former is the drawing
in of the breath, and the latter is the sending it
forth: (Lth, S:) or the verb signifies he sent forth
his breath, after prolonging it: (M, K:) or he
sent forth his breath with a prolonged sound:
[i. e., he sighed, or uttered a long sigh, or sighed
vehemently; or he groaned:] or he filled his
chest, by reason of grief, and then sent forth his
breath: (TA:) or he breathed, raising his voice,
like one moaning, or in grief. (Har p. 20.) ―

زَفَّرَ see the next paragraph.

تزفّر occurs in the Saheeh of El-Bukháree
as meaning تَخَبَّطَ [q. v.]: but El-Jelál says, in
the Towsheeh, that this is not known in the language of the Arabs. (MF.)
-A2-  [Freytag explains
it as meaning He ate fat food, breaking the fast;
like ↓ زفّر; (which latter generally means, in the
present day, he rendered greasy;) but this I
believe to be post-classical. See De Sacy's Chrest.
Ar., sec. ed., i. 270.]

Arabic, it means Grease, greasy food, or flesh-meat: app. from the Pers. زَفَرْ or زَفْر, signifying
