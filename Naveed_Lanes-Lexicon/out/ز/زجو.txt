زجو1
زَجَا, (S, K,) aor. يَزْجُو, (S,) inf. n. زَجَآءٌ (S,
K, and Ham p. 78) and زَجْوٌ (K and Ham) and

or along, quickly. (Ham ubi suprà: there indicated by the context, but not expressed.) ―
-b2-  It
(a bad piece of money) passed, or had currency.
(Er-Rághib, TA.) ―
-b3-  It (an affair) was, or became, easy; and right, in a right state, or right
in its direction or tendency. (K, TA.) Hence
the trad., لَا تَزْجُو صَلَاةٌ لَا يُقْرَأُ فِيهَا بِفَاتِحَةِ الكِتَابِ
i. e. [A prayer in which the opening chapter of
the Book (meaning the Kur-án) is not recited]

said of the [tax called] خَرَاج, It was, or became,
easy of collection. (S.) ―
-b5-  زَجَآءٌ also signifies The
acting with penetrative energy, and effectiveness,
in an affair. (S, K.) One says, هٰذَا الأَمْرُ قَدْ
زَجَوْنَا عَلَيْهِ [app. meaning This affair, we have
effected it, or accomplished it; like as one says,
مَضَيْنَا عَلَى الأَمْرِ]. (T, TA.) And عَطَآءٌ قَلِيلٌ يَزْجُو
خَيْرٌ مِنْ كَثِيرٍ لَا يَزْجُو [A small gift that is effective is better than much that will not be effective].

زجّاهُ, (S, Msb, TA,) inf. n. تَزْجِيَةٌ, (S, TA,)
He pushed it gently, (S, Msb, TA,) in order that
it might go on; as also ↓ ازجاهُ; and ↓ زَجَاهُ, aor.
يَزْجُوهُ, inf. n. زَجْوٌ: and this last, he drove it, or
urged it on, gently; (TA;) [and so زجّاهُ and
↓ ازجاهُ, as will be shown by what follows:] or
↓ زَجَاهُ signifies [simply] he drove it, or urged it
on: and he pushed it: and so [app. in both of
these senses] زجّاهُ and ↓ ازجاهُ. (K.) Hence, i. e.
from زَجَّيْتُهُ meaning “ I pushed it gently,” (Har
p. 304,) one says, كَيْفَ تُزَجِّى الأَيَّامَ (S, Har) i. e.
كَيْفَ تُدَافِعُهَا [How dost thou strive with the days in
pushing them on, or making them to pass away?]:
(S:) or كيف تَدْفَعُهَا [how dost thou push on the
days? and thus may mean also كيف تدافعها]:
(Har:) [or how dost thou make the days to pass
away? for] زجّى الأَيَّامَ means he made the days
to pass away: (MA:) [or how dost thou pass the
days? for it is also said that] تَزْجِيَةٌ signifies the
passing [one's] days. (KL.) [زجّى الأَيَّامَ may
be well rendered He made the days to pass away
by means of exertion; and so دَفَعَهَا and دَافَعَهَا.
Har (ubi suprà) uses the phrase أُزَجِّى أَيَّامًا مُسْوَدَّةً
as meaning I push on evil and hard days.] ↓ ازجى
الشَّىْءَ, also, inf. n. إِزْجَآءٌ, is expl. by Az as signifying دَافَعَ بِقَلِيلِهِ [app. meaning He strove to
push on life, or to repel want or the like, with
little of the thing]: and accord. to a saying heard
by him from a man of the tribe of Fezárah,
نُزَجِّىدُنْيَانَا [or the correct reading may be
↓ نُزْجِى, and accord. to either reading the phrase
may be rendered We strive to push on life, or to
repel want &c., with little of our worldly possessions,] means we content ourselves in respect of
our worldly possessions with scanty sustenance.
(TA. [See also 5.]) One says also CCC الإِبِلَ ↓ أَزْجَيْتُ
I drove the camels. (S.) And CCC وَلَدَهَا ↓ البَقَرَةُ تُزْجِى
The [wild] cow drives her young one. (S.) الرِّيحُ
السَّحَابَ ↓ تُزْجِىِ CCC The wind drives along the clouds:
(S:) or drives along gently the clouds; as also
تُزَجِّيهِ, but in an intensive sense. (Msb.) In like
manner, سَحَابًا ↓ يُزْجِى is said of God, in the Kur
[xxiv. 43]: and in the same [xvii. 68], رَبُّكُمُ الَّذِى
لَكُمُ الْفُلْكَ فِى البَحْرِ ↓ يُزْجِى CCC [Your Lord is He
who driveth along for you the ship in the sea].
(TA.) And a poet says,
↓ زَجَّيْتُهُ بِالقَوْلِ وَازْدَجَيْتُهُ
i. e. [I drove him with speech, and] urged him
on: for اِزْدَجَاهُ signifies سَاقَهُ [like زَجَّاهُ &c.].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And زجّى حَاجَتِى He made easy the
attainment of my want. (TA.)
-A2-  زجّى الرُّمْحَ
i. q. أَزَجَّهُ q. v. in art. زج. (TA in that art.)

أَزْجَوَ see 2, in ten places. ازجى also signifies
He made money, or bad money, to pass, or be
current. (Er-Rághib, TA.)

تَزَجَّيْتُ بِكَذَا I contented myself with such a
thing: a rájiz says,
تَزَجَّ مِنْ دُنْيَاكَ بِالبَلَاغِ
[Content thyself with what is sufficient of thy
worldly possessions]. (S. [See also 2.])

إِزْتَجَوَ see 2, near the end of the paragraph.
أَزْجَى More penetrating and effective in an
affair than another: (S, K:) so in the saying,

more penetrating and effective in this affair than
such a one]. (S, K. *)
مُزْجًى, applied to a horse [or other beast], That

A small, or scanty, thing; (S, Er-Rághib, TA;)
or such as is mean, or paltry; that may be
pushed and driven away because of the little
account that is made of it. (Er-Rághib, TA.)
بِضَاعَةٌ مُزْجَاةٌ means Small, or scanty, merchandise; little in quantity: (S, K:) and so it is
said to mean in the Kur [xii. 88]: or, as in some
copies of the S, little, or mean, or paltry, merchandise: (TA:) or mean, or paltry, merchandise, rejected by every one to whom it is
offered: (A, TA:) or merchandise wherewith the
days are pushed on (تُدْفَعُ [i. e. made to pass away
by means of exertion]) because of its scantiness:
(Msb, TA: [for مُزْجَاةٌ بِهَا:]) or, accord. to the
shereef El-Murtadà, merchandise driven along
portion after portion, scantily and feebly: (TA:)
or merchandise in respect of which a lowering of
the price is demanded on account of its badness
(فِيهَا إِغْمَاضٌ); (Th, TA;) not in perfect condition: (Th, K, TA:) thus, too, it is expl. as used
in the Kur: and some say that what is there
mentioned consisted of fruit of the terebinth-tree,
or of صَنَوْبَر [app. here meaning pine-cones]: some
say, of commodities of the Arabs of the desert,
wool, and clarified butter: and some say, of deficient pieces of money. (TA.)
مُزَجًّى Weak: so termed because of his lagging
behind, and requiring to be urged on: (Ham
p. 441:) or anything not perfect in nobility, nor
in any other praiseworthy quality: or, as some
say, one driven to generosity against his will:
(TA:) and also, (TA,) applied to a man, i. q.
مُزَلَّجٌ [q. v., app. here meaning deficient in manliness, or manly virtue, or the like]. (S, TA.)
[الزَّمَانُ المُزَجَّى, a phrase used by Har, is expl.
(p. 429) as meaning حَقُّهُ أَنْ يُزَجِّيهِ النَّاسُ, i. e.
Time that requires men to push it on, or to make
it to pass away by means-of exertion.]
مِزْجَآءٌ A man who urges on much the camel, or
beast, that he rides. (TA.)
