said in the A to be tropical: app. because it is an
inf. n. used as an epithet.]) It is also applied to a
well (رَكِيَّة), meaning Smooth and slippery at its
top [or mouth], so that he who stands upon it
slips into it; (TA;) and so ↓ زَلُوخٌ, (S, TA,) and

to which an arrow is shot: (S, K:) a rájiz says,
مِنْ مَائَةٍ زَلْخٍ بِمِرِّيخٍ غَالْ
[app. meaning From a hundred fathoms, a limit,
or an extreme limit, to which one shoots with a
long four-feathered arrow rising in its flight so
as to exceed the usual limit; from three hundred
to four hundred cubits being said to be the limit,
or extreme limit, to which an arrow is shot; and
غَالْ being used by poetic license for غَالٍ]: (S:)
or, accord. to ADk, زلخ here signifies the furthest limit to which an arrow is shot by him who
endeavours to shoot it to the utmost distance: or,
accord. to Lth, the raising the hand, or arm, in
shooting an arrow to the furthest possible distance: so says Az; who adds that he had not
heard this last explanation on any other authority
than that of Lth, but hoped it might be correct.

as also زلجان [i. e. زَلَجَانٌ, which is an inf. n.;
and in like manner زَلَخَانٌ and زَلْخَانٌ, accord. to
the TK, are inf. ns., of which the verb is زَلَخَ,
aor.
زَلُخَ; though it is more probably
زَلَخَ]. (TA.)

مِنْهَا الصِّيبَانُ: in two other copies, يَتَزَلَّجُ: and in
one of these, عَلَيْهَا is put in the place of مِنْهَا.]) ―
-b2-
Also (tropical:)  A pain that attacks in the back, (A, K,)
which consequently becomes hard, or rigid, and
rough, (K,) depriving one of the power of motion
(A, K) by reason of its violence: (A:) and some
pronounce the word ↓ زُلَخَةٌ, without teshdeed to
the ل; and some, erroneously, with ج: (TA:)
or it is a disease that attacks in the back and the
side: (ISd, TA:) [and ↓ زُلَّخٌ appears to signify
the same, or to be a coll. gen. n.: for] AA cites
the following verse:
وَصِرْتُ مِنْ بَعْدِ القَوَامِ أَبْزَخَا
الدَّهْرُ بِظَهْرِى زُلَّخَا ↓ وَزَلَّخَ
[app. meaning, And I have become, after goodliness
