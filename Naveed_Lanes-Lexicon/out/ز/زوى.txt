زوّى, inf. n. تَزْوِيَةٌ: see 5.
-A2-  زَيَّيْتُهُ, (S, Msb,
K,) which by rule should be زَوَّيْتُهُ, (S, Msb,) but
is made to accord with زِىٌّ in order to facilitate
the pronunciation, (Msb,) inf. n. accord. to the K
تَزْيِيَةٌ, but correctly, as Lth says, تَزِيَّةٌ, in measure
like تَحِيَّةٌ, (TA,) I invested him with, or made
him to have, a زِىّ [i. e. garb, guise, &c.]; (S, *
Msb, K, * TA;) by means of, or with, such a
thing: you say, زَيَّيْتُهُ بِكَذَا [which may be rendered I invested, decked, or adorned, him with
such a thing; agreeably with what follows].
(Msb.) Accord. to Fr, they say, زَيَّيْتُ الجَارِيَةَ,
meaning I invested the girl, or young woman,
with a garb, or guise, &c.; and decked, or adorned,
her. (TA.) ―
-b2-  You say also, زوّى الكَلَامَ, meaning He prepared the speech in his mind; like
زَوَّرَهُ. (TA.)
-A3-  زَيَّيْتُ زَايًا and زَوَّيْتُ زَايًا [mean
I wrote, or uttered, a ز]: some [hold the ا in
زاى to be originally ى, and therefore] say زَيَّيْتُ:
others [hold it to be originally و, and therefore]
say زَوَّيْتُ. (IB, on the letter أَلِف.) Zeyd Ibn-Thábit said, in relation to the expression in the
Kur [ii. 261] نُنْشِزُهَا, [accord. to one reading, or
reciting,] هِىَ زَاىٌ فَزَيِّهَا, meaning [It is زاى, therefore make thou it زاى in thy reading, or reciting;
or] read thou it, or recite thou it, with the
زاى. (S.)

ازوى: see art. زو.

تزوّى He was, or became, [or placed himself,] in a زَاوِيَة, i. e. corner, of a house or
chamber; as also ↓ زوّى, (K,) inf. n. تَزْوِيَةٌ;
(TA;) and ↓ انزوى. (K.)
-A2-  تَزَيَّا, from الزِّىُّ;

himself with a garb, guise, or dress; [or with an
external appearance;] (MA, KL;) he decked, or
adorned, himself. (MA.) You say of a man,
تزيّا بِزِىٍّ حَسَنٍ [He invested himself with a beautiful, or goodly, garb, &c.]. (Lth, TA.) Hence
the saying of El-Mutanebbee,
وَقَدْ يَتَزَيَّا بِالهَوَى غَيْرُ أَهْلِهِ
وَيَسْتَصْحِبُ الإِنْسَانُ مَنْ لَا يُلَائِمُهْ
(TA:) i. e. [And verily, or sometimes, or often,
one who is not entitled to it] assumes the guise of
love; and the man asks to be his companion him
who is not suited to him: (W p. 374:) his disciple Ibn-Jinnee, however, objected to him his
saying يتزيّا, and expressed his opinion that the
correct word is يَتَزَوَّى; and El-Mutanebbee admitted that he did not know the former word in
any [classical] poetry, nor in any lexicological
book, but asserted the verb in use to be only
تَزَيَّا: (MF, TA:) in the M it is said that IJ
held تَزَيَّا to be originally تَزَوْيَا, and the و to be
changed into ى because quiescent, and incorporated into the ى preceded by it. (TA.)
7

people, or party, drew together, one portion of
them to another portion. (TA.) ―

first sentence.
زَا and زًا and زَآءٌ and see زَاىٌ, below.
زَىْ and زَىٌّ: see زَاىٌ, below.
زِىٌّ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) originally زِوْىٌ, (S,
Msb,) Garb, guise, dress, habit, fashion of dress,
and aspect, or outward appearance; syn. لِبَاسٌ,
(S, TA,) and هَيْئَةٌ, (Fr, Msb, K, TA,) and مَنْظَرٌ:
(Fr, TA:) pl. أَزْيَآءٌ. (K.) [In the Kur xix. 75,]
some read أَحْسَنُ أَثَاثًا وَزِيًّا [Better in respect of
household-goods and in respect of garb, &c.]:
others read رِيًّا, with ر: (TA:) and رِئْيًا: and
رِيْئًا: and رِيًا. (Bd.)
زَاىٌ, (Kr, S, K, &c.,) in which the ا, accord. to
Lth, is originally ى, but accord. to Sb and IJ
it is و, (TA,) A certain letter (i. e. ز); (S, TA;)
[in spelling, pronounced زَاىْ; and] also called
↓ زَآءٌ, (Kr, S, K,) and ↓ زًا, and [in spelling (see
the first sentence of art. ب)] ↓ زَا, (Kr, K, but
omitted in some copies of the K,) this last being
indecl., (Kr, TA,) and ↓ زَىٌّ (K) and [in spelling]
↓ زَىْ: (Kr, K:) of all which, the first is that
which is held in [most] repute: (TA:) and this
and زَآءٌ may be meant by J's saying, الزَّاىُ حَرْفٌ
يُمَدُّ وَيُقْصَرُ وَلَا يُكْتَبُ إِلَّا بِيَآءٍ بَعْدَ الأَلِفِ; though
the author of the K asserts J to have erred in
saying this: (MF, TA:) the pl. is أَزْوَآءٌ and أَزْيَآءٌ,
(Kudot;,) the former or the latter accord. to different
opinions, (TA,) and أَزْوٍ and أَزْىٍ, (K,) each [originally] of the measure أَفْعُلٌ. (TA.) One says,
هٰذِهِ زَاىٌ حَسَنَةٌ [This is a beautiful; ز]: and كَتَبْتُ
زَايًا صَغِيرَةً [I wrote a small; ز]: and the like. (IJ,
TA.)
-A2-  زَاىْ is also said by the vulgar on an
occasion of wonder, and of disapproval: but [SM
says,] I know not what is its origin. (TA.) [It
may be from the Pers. زَىْ, or زِهِى; which are
likewise said on an occasion of wonder. إِزَّاىْ and
إِزَّىّ and إِزَّىْ, and with أَ in the place of إِ, are also
said by the vulgar in Egypt on an occasion of
wonder, and of denial, meaning How? And زَىْ
is used by them for the prefix كَ, meaning Like.]
زُوَيَّةٌ: see what next follows.
زُيَيَّةٌ dim. of زَاىٌّ [accord. to those who hold
the ا in the latter to be originally ى, or ↓ زُوَيَّةٌ

the first column]. (TA.)
زَاوِيَةٌ A corner, or an angle, (رُكْن,) of a house
or room or the like: (K:) of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ
from زَوَى signifying جَمَعَ; because of its em-
bracing (لِأَنَّهَا جَمَعَتْ) a part, or portion, (قُطْرًا,)
thereof: (Msb, TA:) pl. زَوَايَا [which is irreg.;
for by rule it should be زَوَآءٍ, being originally of
the measure فَوَاعِلُ, not فَعَائِلُ]. (S, K.) They
say, كَمْ فِى الزَّوَايَا مِنَ الخَبَايَا [How many hidden
things are there in the corners!]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [In
geometry, An angle. ―
-b3-  And hence, زَاوِيَةُ العَوَّآءِ

cited voce رَاوِيَةٌ, the pl. زَوَايَا is used as meaning
Houses, or tents. (T in art. روى.) ―
-b5-  [And in the
present day, the term زَاوِيَةٌ is also applied to A
small mosque, or chapel: and in some instances,
a building of this kind, thus called, serves as a
hospice, or an asylum for poor Muslims, students
and others; like رِبَاطٌ.]
