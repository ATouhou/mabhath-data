but in the K “ and ”) a party in a state of dispersion: (K:) pl. زُمَرٌ: (S, A, K:) you say,
جَاؤُوا زُمَرًا They came in parties in a state of dispersion, one after another: (A:) some say that
زُمْرَةٌ is from ↓ زَمْرٌ [originally an inf. n., (see 1,
first sentence,) and hence] signifying “ sound,”
because a company of men is not without sound:
others, that it signifies a company of few persons;
from شَاةٌ زَمِرَةٌ: (MF:) but the former is the
proper derivation, and is confirmed by what is
said in the B. (TA.)
زَمُورٌ: see the next paragraph.

Msb,) applied to a woman; (S, Msb, K;) A

-b2-  Also زَمَّارَةٌ,
(assumed tropical:)  A fornicatress, or an adulteress: (Th, A'Obeyd,
Az, S, K:) so in a trad., in which it is said
نَهَى عَنْ كَسْبِ الزَّمَّارَةِ He prohibited the gain
of the fornicatress: (Th, A'Obeyd, Az, S:) so
called because she publishes her business: (Th:)
some say that the correct word is here رَمَّازَة,
because such a woman makes signs with her lips
and her eyes and her eyebrows: Az says that
he holds the former to be the right; and Abu-l-
'Abbás Ahmad says that the latter is wrong, and
that the former signifies a beautiful prostitute:
but Az adds that the trad. may mean as above, or
he prohibited the gain of the female singer, as
AHát relates on the authority of As. (TA.)

the two rings of the [shackle called] غُلّ: (M, O,
K:) so termed because of its sound. (O.) ―
-b5-
Also A she-ostrich. (Har p. 408.)

مِزْمَارٌ A musical reed, or pipe; (S, * A, Msb, *
K, * TA;) what is called in Persian نَاىْ [now
generally meaning a flute]; (marginal note in a
copy of the KT;) as also ↓ زَمَّارَةٌ, (K,) [which
latter, by many pronounced زُمَّارَة, and generally
so pronounced in Egypt, is applied to a double
reed-pipe, figured and described in my work on
the Modern Egyptians,] and ↓ مَزْمُورٌ and ↓ مَزْمُورٌ,

(S, * A.) It is related in a trad., that Mohammad,
on hearing Aboo-Moosà El-Ash'aree reciting,
said to him, لَقَدْ أُعْطِيتَ مِزْمَارًا مِنْ مَزَامِيرِ آلِ دَاوُودَ
(tropical:)  [Verily thou hast been gifted with a pipe like
that of David himself]; likening the sweetness
of his voice and melody to the sound of the مِزْمَار;
(TA;) as though he had musical pipes in his
throat: or مزاميرآل داوود is here the same as
مَزْمُورَات دَاوُود: (A:) for, ―
-b2-  مَزَامِيرُ دَاوُودَ also
signifies [The Psalms of David;] what David
used to sing, or chant, (يَتَغَنَّى بِهِ, in the CK
يُتَغَنَّى به,) of the Psalms: (K:) and to such is
likened the utmost sweetness of voice in reciting:
and آل is said to be here redundant or pleonastic;
meaning the person: (TA:) or (so in the TA,
but in the K “ and ”) مزامير داوود signifies kinds
of prayer, or supplication: it is pl. of مِزْمَارٌ and
of ↓ مَزْمُورٌ or مُزْمُورٌ. (So in different copies of
the K.)
مَزْمُورٌ and مُزْمُورٌ: see مِزْمَارٌ, in two places.
مُسْتَزْمِرٌ (tropical:)  Shrinking, and abject, or ignominious,
in his own estimation. (K, TA.) [See also its
verb.]
