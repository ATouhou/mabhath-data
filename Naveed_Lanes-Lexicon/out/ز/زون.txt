زون1
زَوڤنَ [زَانَهُ, aor. يَزُونُهُ, is a dial. var. of زَانَهُ having
for its aor. يَزِينُهُ.] An Arab woman of the desert
is related to have said to IAar, إِنَّكَ لَتَزُونُنَا إِذَا
طَلَعْتَ, meaning تَزِينُنَا [i. e. Verily thou gracest
us when thou comest to us (عَلَيْنَا)]. (TA.)
زَانٌ Indigestion; syn. بَشَمٌ; for النَّشَمُ in the
copies of the K is a mistranscription for البَشَمُ;
(TA;) expl. by Ed-Dubeyreeyeh as syn. with
تُخْمَةٌ; as in the phrase, لَيْسَ يَشْكُو الزَّانَ [He does
not complain of indigestion]: (Fr, TA:) and so
↓ زَانَةٌ: (K and TA in art. زين:) or this signifies
a single fit of indigestion. (TA in that art.)
