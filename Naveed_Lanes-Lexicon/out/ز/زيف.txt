تَزْيِيفٌ is said to signify primarily The separating, or setting apart, such [money] as is passable, or current, from such as is termed زَائِف:
and hence, the rejecting [money], or returning
[it]: and the making [it], or proving [it] to be,
false, or spurious. (TA.) One says, زيّف الدَّرَاهِمَ,
(S, MA, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَزْيِيفٌ, (Msb,) He
made, (MA, K,) or pronounced, (K,) or showed,
(Msb,) the dirhems, or pieces of money, to be
bad, (MA, Msb,) or to be such as are termed
زُيُوف; (K;) as also ↓ زَافَهَا. (Lh, K.) See also 1,
near the end of the paragraph. ―

by a mulct; or made it allowable to take, or shed,
his blood: (TA:) or he made him to be contemptible, ignominious, base, or vile, in the estimation of others: (Kr, TA:) from دِرْهَمٌ زَائِفٌ
“ a bad dirhem, or piece of money. ” (TA.)

تزيّفت, said of a woman, [like تزيّقت,] She
ornamented, or adorned, herself. (O.) ―
-b2-  [Accord.
to Freytag, تزيّف signifies It was adulterated:
and in Har p. 612 it is expl. as signifying صار
زيّفا فى احواله, which seems to have this or a
similar meaning; زيّفا being app. a mistranscription for زَيْفًا or مُزَيَّفًا.]
زَيْفٌ: see زَائِفٌ, in four places.
-A2-  Also The
إِفْرِيز, i. e., (Kr, TA,) the طَنَف, (Kr, O, K, TA,)
[meaning the coping, or ledge, or cornice,] that
protects a wall, (O, K, TA,) surrounding the

O, in the K “ and,”) i. q. شُرَفٌ [meaning acroterial ornaments forming a single member of a
cresting of a wall, or of the crown of a cornice]:
n. un. with ة. (Kr, O, K.)
زَيَّافٌ, and with ة: see the next paragraph, in
three places.
زَائِفٌ One who walks in the manner described
in the first sentence of this art.; as also ↓ زَيْفٌ,
which is an inf. n. used as an epithet: (TA:)
[and so ↓ زَيَّافٌ, but properly in an intensive
sense:] and ↓ زَيَّافَةٌ a she-camel proud and self-
conceited [in her gait]. (S.) Hence, (TA,)
الزَّائِفُ signifies The lion; as also ↓ الزَّيَّافُ; (O,
K;) but the latter has an intensive meaning:
(TA:) so called because of his proud and selfconceited walk. (O, TA.)
-A2-  Also, and ↓ زَيْفٌ,
(S, Kr, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) the latter an inf. n.
used as an epithet, (Msb,) or, accord. to IDrd,
this is a vulgar term, (O,) or bad, (K,) applied
to a dirhem, or piece of money, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,
K,) to gold and to silver, (Har p. 369, referring
to the latter word,) Bad: (Kr, Msb, and Har
ubi suprà:) or such as are rejected, or returned,
because of adulterating alloy therein: (Mgh, O,
K:) or, as some say, such as are less bad than
what are termed بَهْرَج, being such as are rejected
by [the officers of] the government-treasury;
whereas the بهرج are such as are rejected by the
merchants, or traders: (Mgh:) the pl. is زِيَافٌ
and أَزْيَافٌ, (O, K,) [the latter a pl. of pauc.,] or
the pl. of ↓ زَيْفٌ is زُيُوفٌ, and the pl. of زَائِفٌ is
زُيَّفٌ: (Mgh, * Msb:) accord. to some, the زُيُوف
are such as are done over with a compound of
quicksilver and sulphur. (Msb.) [It is implied
in the Msb that ↓ زَيْفٌ is the more common term,
though, as has been stated above, it is said by
IDrd to be vulgar: and it is also applied to
human beings: for ex.,] a poet says,
تَرَى القَوْمَ أَشْبَاهًا إِذَا نَزَلُوامَعًا
وَفِى القَوْمِ زَيْفٌ مِثْلُ زَيْفِ الدَّرَاهِمِ
[Thou seest the people to be likes when they alight
together; but among the people are bad like the
bad of dirhems.] (TA.)
