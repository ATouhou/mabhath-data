زن1
زَنڤ3َ see 4, in five places.
-A2-  زَنَّ عَصَبُهُ, [aor.,
accord. to rule,
زَنِ3َ, or the sec. pers. may be زَنِنْتَ,
and the aor.
زَنَ3َ, and the inf. n., in this case, رَنَنٌ,
which see below, but the TK makes its aor. to
be
زَنُ3َ, and the inf. n. زَنٌّ,] His sinews dried up.
(K.) ―
-b2-  زَنَّ فَذَنَّ means حقن فقطر [which may
be rendered He kept in, or retained, his urine,
and then dribbled it, or his urine was kept in, or
retained, and then dribbled]. (TA. [See زِنِّينٌ.])
4
أَزْنَنْتُهُ I thought him to possess good or evil;
as also ↓ زَنَنْتُهُ, aor.
زَنُ3َ, inf. n. زَنٌّ: or both mean I
imputed, or attributed, to him good or evil:
(Msb:) or فُلَانًا بِخَيْرٍ ↓ زَنَّ or بِشَرٍّ he thought such
a one to possess good or evil; like أَزَنَّهُ; syn. ظَنَّهُ بِهِ:
(K:) or, accord. to Lh, one says, أَزْنَنْتُهُ بِمَالٍ and
بِخَيْرٍ I thought him to possess [property and (as
appears from what is said below on his authority)
wealth]: but ↓ زَنَنْتُهُ is what the vulgar say, and is
wrong. (TA.) And أَزْنَنْتُهُ بِشَىْءٍ, (S,) or بِكَذَا,
(K,) and also بكذا ↓ زَنَنْتُهُ, (Har p. 112,) [and
accord. to Golius ↓ اِزْتَنَنْتُهُ, mentioned by him as
from the S, but not found therein by Freytag,
nor by me in either of my copies,] I suspected
him of a thing, or of such a thing: (S, K, and
Har ubi suprà:) [but] Lh says, لَا يَكُونُ الإِزْنَانُ
فِى الخَيْرِ [app. meaning that أَزَنَّ is not said in
relation to that which is good: see what is cited
on his authority above]. (TA.) And ازنّهُ بِالأَمْرِ
He suspected him of the thing, or affair; like
أَظَنَّهُ. (S.) And هُوَ يُزَنُّ بِكَذَا [He is suspected of
such a thing]. (S.) Hassán says,
حَصَانٌ رَزَانٌ مَا تُزَنُّ بِرِيبَةٍ
i. e. [Chaste, staid,] she is not suspected of evil:
[in which تُزَنُّ may be from ↓ زُنَّتْ or from أُزِنَّتْ:]
but some restrict themselves to the quadriliteral
verb [ازنّ]. (Msb.)

إِزْتَنَ3َ see 4.
زَنَّةٌ A suspicion: whence the saying, ↓ أَبُو زَنَّةٍ
شَرٌّ مِنْهُ أَخُو زَنَّةٍ The ape, or baboon, or monkey,
(القِرْدُ,) worse than he is the person who has conceived a suspicion: (A, TA:) [for] ―
-b2-  أَبُو زَنَّةٍ, (so
in three copies of the S and in my MS. copy of
the K,) or ↓ ابو زِنَّةٍ, (thus in the CK and TK and
JM, [in the second and third of which it is expressly said to be “ with kesr,” which, however,
the author of the K should have added, accord. to
his usual practice, if he meant it to be thus,])
signifies القِرْدُ. (S, K.)
أَبُو زِنَّةٍ: see what next precedes, in two places.
مَآءٌ زَنَنٌ, and مِيَاهٌ زَنَنٌ, [which suggests that زَنَنٌ
is an inf. n. used as an epithet,] A water, and
waters, small in quantity, and narrow: (K:)
[for] زَنَنٌ signifies strait, or narrow; like زَنَآءٌ and
زَنِىٌّ [which do not belong to this art.]: (TA:) or
مَآءٌ زَنَنٌ means [a place of water] of which one
knows not whether there be in it water or
not. (K.)
ظِلٌّ زَنَانٌ Short [or contracted] shade; like زَنَآءٌ
[mentioned in art. زنأ]. (K.)
زُنَانَى A fluid like mucus, that falls from the
noses of camels: (K:) but the more approved
word is ذُنَانَى. (TA.)
زَنَانِىٌّ A man who suffices for himself, without
any other. (K.)
زَنَّانٌ One who opines, or conjectures, much;
i. q. ظَنَّانٌ. (TA.)
زِنِّينٌ One suppressing his urine and his ordure:
occurring in a trad.: or, as some say, it is زِبِّينٌ,
[q. v.,] with ب. (TA. [But see 1, and see also
what here follows.])
أَزَنُّ One suppressing his urine [or his ordure];
syn. حَاقِنٌ: such is one of the persons forbidden,
in a trad., to act as إِمَام to others. (TA in art.
نصر: mentioned also, but not expl., in the present
art. in the TA.) [See also the next preceding
paragraph.]
