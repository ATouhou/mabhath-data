زرفزَرَافَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ زُرَافَةٌ (Msb as on the
authority of A'Obeyd [but not found by me
elsewhere in the sense here assigned to it]) and
↓ زَرَافَّةٌ, [which is of a rare form, like حَمَارَّةٌ, q. v.,]
(A'Obeyd, IF, S, Msb, K,) this last mentioned
by El-Kanánee, (A'Obeyd, S,) and by Kzz in his
Jámi', but not known to A'Obeyd on any other
authority than that of El-Kanánee, and the first is
said by him (A'Obeyd) to be preferable, (TA,)

Msb, K:) or ten thereof: (K, TA:) accord. to
some copies of the K what is termed an عَشِيرَة

(TA:) pl. زَرَافَاتٌ (IF, S, Mgh, Msb) and زَرَافَّاتٌ:
(IF, Msb:) in a poem of Lebeed, زَرَّافَات, with
teshdeed to the ر. (TA.) One says, أَتَانِى القَوْمُ
↓ بِزَرَافَّتَهِمْ [or بِزَرَافَتِهِمْ, i. e. The people, or party,
came to me with their whole company; meaning,
all together]. (TA.)

(S, O, Mgh, L, Msb, K,) the latter, only, mentioned by IDrd, (TA,) who says, I doubt whether
it be a genuine Arabic word, or not, (Msb, TA,)
but some say that the latter is vulgar, (TA,) and
↓ زَرَافَةٌ and ↓ زُرَافَّةٌ, (O, L, Msb, K,) but the first
of these four is the most chaste, (L, TA,) [The
camelopard, or giraffe;] a certain beast, (S, K,
[in the Mgh erroneously said to be a beast of
prey,]) of beautiful make, the fore legs of which
are longer than its kind legs; (TA;) said to be
called by a name signifying جَمَاعَةٌ because it has
the form of an assemblage of animals; (Msb;)
in Pers. called أُشْتُرْ گَاوْ پَلَنْك, (S, Mgh, K,) i. e.
camel-ox-leopard, (TA,) because it has resemblances to the camel and the ox and the leopard:
(K, TA:) pl. زَرَافَى, or زُرَافَى, or زَرَافِىُّ, (accord.
to different copies of the K, the last accord. to the
TA,) like زَرَابِىُّ. (TA.)
