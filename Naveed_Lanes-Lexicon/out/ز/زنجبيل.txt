زنجبيلزَنْجَبِيلٌ [Ginger; amomum zinziber;] a certain
plant growing in the country of the Arabs, in the
land of 'Omán, (AHn, TA,) and in El-Yemen
also; (TA;) well known: (S:) [or the root
thereof;] a certain root, or roots, (accord. to different copies of the K,) creeping beneath the
ground; (K, TA;) burning, or biting, to the
tongue; (TA;) growing like the stalks of the
papyrus, (K, TA,) and the رَاسَن [mentioned
below]: there is no wild sort of it; nor is it a
tree that is eaten fresh like as herbs, or leguminous
plants, are eaten; but it is used in a dry state;
and its conserve is the best of conserves; and the
best thereof is what is brought from the country
of the Zinj and China: (TA:) it has a property
that is heating, or warming, digestive, lenitive in
a small degree, strengthening to the venereal
faculty, (K, TA,) clearing to the phlegm, (TA,)
sharpening to the intellect, (K * TA,) and exhilarating: (TA:) if mixed with the moisture
of the liver of the goat, and dried, and pulverized,
and used as a collyrium, it removes the film [upon
the eye], and obscurity of the sight. (K, TA.) ―

It is mentioned in the Kur, where it is said,
[lxxvi. 17 and 18,] كَانَ مِزَاجُهَا زَنْجَبِيلًا عَيْنًا فِيهَا
تُسَمَّى سَلْسَبِيلًا [The admixture whereof shall be
زنجبيل, a fountain therein named Selsebeel]:
i. e. it shall have the flavour of زنجبيل [or ginger],
which the Arabs esteem very pleasant: it may
mean that زنجبيل is [essentially] in the wine of
Paradise: or that it is the admixture thereof: or
that it is a name for the fountain whence this
wine is taken, and which is named Selsebeel also.
(Az, O, TA.) As some assert, (ISd, TA,) it
means also Wine [absolutely]. (S, ISd, K.) ―
-b3-
زَنْجَبِيلُ الكِلَابِ A certain herb, or leguminous
plant, the leaves of which are like [those of] the
خِلَاف [or salix Aegyptia], and the twigs are
red: it clears the [discoloration of the face termed]
كَلَف, and the [spots in the skin termed] نَمَش;
and it kills dogs; (K;) wherefore it is named in
relation to them. (TA.) ―
-b4-  زَنْجَبِيلُ العَجَمِ i. q.
الأُشْتُرْغَازُ [a word of Persian origin, now applied
by Arabs to A species of carline thistle]. (K.)
[Accord. to Freytag, Horminum, or salvia silvestris: but this, I believe, is what is called in
Pers. أُشْتُرْغَان.] ―
-b5-  زَنْجَبِيلُ الشَّامِ i. q. الرَّاسَنُ [Inula
helenium, common inula, or elecampane]. (K.)
