to others of the leading lexicologists it seems to

knots of the shoots, whence the bunches of grapes
would grow: (TA:) this it does when the sap

leaves. (K, TA.) ―

in the T and S and M ↓ مُزَغِّبَةٌ, but in the present
art. in the TA it seems to be indicated that it is
probably ↓ مُزْغِبَّةٌ,] signifying having زَغَب [i. e.
