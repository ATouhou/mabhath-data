زول1
زَالَ, aor. يَزُولُ, (K,) and, accord. to the K,
also يَزَالُ, which is rare, on the authority of Aboo-
'Alee, but this is the aor. of زَالَ like خَافَ, [which
has a different meaning from the former verb,]
(MF, TA,) inf. n. زَوَالٌ (K) and زُوُولٌ (Lh, K)
[which in all its senses except one mentioned
below may app. be pronounced also زُؤُولٌ, like
حُؤُولٌ for حُوُولٌ, pl. of حَوْلٌ,] and زَوِيلٌ and زَوْلٌ,

الدُّنْيَا وَشِيكَةُ الزَّوَالِ [The world, or worldly enjoyment or good, is quick in passing away, or coming
to nought]. (TA.) And زال زَوَالُهُ, and زَوَالُهَا:
see زَوَالٌ: and for the former see also زَوِيلٌ. And
زال زَوِيلُهُ, and زَوِيلُهَا: see زَوِيلٌ. And زال الشَّىْءُ

see not why.]) ―
-b2-  Hence, زالت الشَّمْسُ, inf. n.

and زِيَالٌ and زَوَلَانٌ, (tropical:)  The sun declined from the

(ed. of Boolák), i. e. ظَعْنُهُمْ, thus in the K, and
thus only, the verb being indicated by a preceding
phrase; in the TA زالت ظعنهم. which is an evident
mistranscription;] inf. n. زَيْلُولَةٌ, (K,) like قَيْلُولَةٌ
[an inf. n. of قَالَ, aor. يَقِيلُ; but more properly
compared to دَيْمُومَةٌ, an inf. n. of دَامَ, aor. يَدُومُ];

place: then an opinion occurred to them different

in the K is added عَنْهُ; but this should be omitted:
the passage is taken from the M; in which عَنْهُ
refers to Lh as the authority. (TA.) ―

ingeniousness, skilfulness, knowledge, or intelligence: or did so, not having it: syn. تَظَرَّفَ.
(IAar, TA.) [See also 5.]

meaning I have not found any ex.]: and حَاوَلَهُ
[as meaning he sought to obtain it, or effect it;
or did so by artful, or skilful, management]:
(S, * K:) and طَالَبَهُ [he made a demand on him,

to the TA, it seems to be used properly in relation
to real things, and tropically in relation to ideal
things. One says, زاول الصَّيْدَ He strove to gain
possession of, or to catch, i. e. he hunted, the
animals of the chase. (See طَرَدَ.)] And زَاوَلْتُهُ
عَنِ الأَمْرُ [I strove with him to avert him, or to

appointed for a fixed time; i. e., to preserve my
life though its term is fixed: see the Kur iii. 139].

or cease, from him; or to leave him, or quit him;
he freed him from it, or rid him of it. And

تزوّلهُ and ↓ زوّلهُ i. q. أَجَآءَهُ [He made him,

with whom they sit, and of whom they talk, and
who abstains from what is unlawful and indecorous, and is intelligent; &c.: see art. برز]:
(TA:) pl. masc. أَزْوَالٌ (K, TA) and fem. زَوْلَاتٌ;
the former applied to young men, and the latter
to young women. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Courageous; (K,
TA;) in consequence of whose courage, men are
abashed (يَتَزَايَلُوا [as though زَوْلٌ in this sense belonged to art. زيل]). (TA.) ―

(TA.)
-A3-  (tropical:)  A wonder, or wonderful thing: (S,
K, TA:) pl. أَزْوَالٌ. (S.) One says, هٰذَا زَوْلٌ مِنَ

And one says also, [using it as an epithet,] سَيْرٌ زَوْلٌ

زَوَالٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ زَوِيلٌ and ↓ زَوْلٌ (K)
are inf. ns. of زَالَ [q. v.]. (S, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  And
all signify Motion, commotion, or agitation.
(TA in explanation of the first and last, and K
in explanation of the second.) [Hence,] ↓ زَالَ
زَوَالُهُ, or زَوَالَهُ ↓ زَالَ, (accord. to different copies
of the K,) or اللّٰهُ زَوَالَهُ ↓ زَالَ, (S in art. زيل, and
TA,) and اللّٰهُ زَوَالَهُ ↓ أَزَالَ, (S in art. زيل, and K
and TA,) are imprecations of destruction, or
perdition, or death, (S, K,) and trial, or affliction,
upon him to whom they relate: (S:) or such are
the [second and] third and fourth of these phrases:
but the first is a prayer for one's continuance
where he is, [or his continuance in life; lit.]
meaning May his motion cease; [and hence, may
he continue where he is, or continue in life:] and,
as expl. by ISk, the [second and] third and
fourth [lit.] signify May [He i. e.] God cause
his motion to cease; [and hence, may He, or God,
put an end to his life;] these phrases being
similar to the saying أَسْكَتَ اللّٰهُ نَامَّتَهُ. (TA.)
[Thus all four have virtually the same lit. signification. And the first has also another meaning;
as will be seen below.] El-Aashà says,
هٰذَا النَّهَارُ بَدَا لَهَا مِنْ هَمِّهَا
زَوَالَهَا ↓ مَا بَالُهَا بِاللَّيْلِ زَالَ
(S, TA,) [app. meaning This is the day-time:
an opinion has arisen in her mind such as to
turn her from her former opinion and induce her
to absent herself, (بَدَآءٌ, I suppose, being understood after بَدَا لَهَا, like as it is after بَدَا لَهُمْ in the
Kur xii. 35,) in consequence of her anxiety: what
will be her case in the night? may it (her
phantom) be absent, like as she is absent: for]
the meaning is said to be, زَالَ الخَيَالُ زَوَالَهَا: IAar
says, he disliked the phantom only because it
roused his desire: or [زَالَ may be here syn. with
أَزَالَ, so that] the meaning may be اللّٰهُ زَوَالَهَا ↓ أَزَالَ
[may God make her motion to cease]; and this
is corroborated by the reading of AA, زَوَالُهَا, in
the nom. case, [i. e. زَوَالُهَا ↓ زَالَ may her motion
cease;] which makes this an instance of [the
license termed] الإِقْوَآء: this, he says, is an old
proverbial phrase of the Arabs, and El-Aashà
has used it as he heard it: others than AA read
[زَوَالَهَا,] in the accus. case, without إِقْوَآء, holding
the meaning to be, may her phantom be absent
from us in the night like as she herself is absent
in the day-time. (TA.) ↓ زَوِيلُهُ ↓ زِيلَ, likewise,
means His motion ceased, or may his motion
cease: or, accord. to Z, he became fixed, or motionless, from fear; or may he become so. (TA
in art. زيل.) [See also another rendering of this
phrase in the next paragraph.] One says also,
وَالعَوِيلُ ↓ أَخَذَهُ الزَّوِيلُ Commotion, or agitation,
(K, TA,) and disquietude of mind, (TA,) and
wailing, or raising of the voice in weeping, overcame him. (K, TA.)
-A2-  See also the next paragraph, in three places.
زَوِيلٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
three places.
-A2-  Also The side; syn. جَانِبٌ; and
so ↓ زَوَالٌ: thus in the sayings, زَوِيلُهُ ↓ زَالَ and
↓ زَوَالُهُ ↓ زَالَ, meaning [app. His side became in a
state of commotion, or it quivered,] by reason of
fright: (K:) [or] زَوِيلٌ signifies the heart: so
in the saying, زَوِيلُهُ ↓ زِيلَ [His heart became removed from its place]: (S:) a prov., applied to
one whom an event that has disquieted him has
befallen: as also ↓ زَوَالُهُ ↓ زِيلَ: (Meyd:) [see
also two other renderings of the former phrase in
the next preceding paragraph:] Dhu-r-Rummeh
says, describing the egg of an ostrich,
وَيَيْضَآءُ لَا تَنْحَاشُ مِنَّا وَأُمُّهَا
مِنَّا زَوِيلُهَا ↓ إِذَا مَا رَأَتْنَا زِيلَ
meaning زِيلَ قَلْبُهَا مِنَ الفَزَعِ [i. e. And a white
thing (the egg which he is describing) will not
take fright, and flee from us, or will not shrink
from us, while its mother, when she sees us, her
heart becomes removed from its place by fright in
consequence of the approach of us]: (S in art.
زيل, and Meyd:) or, as some relate it, مِنَّا ↓ زَالَ
زَوِيلُهَا [which means her heart quits its place &c.]:
(TA:) and the former reading may mean the
same as this. (IB, TA in art. زيل.)
زَوَّالٌ Having much زَوْل, i. e. motion. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Accord. to J, it occurs in an أُرْجُوزَة, cited by AA,
as meaning That moves much in his gait, but
traverses a short space: but the right word in
this case is زَوَّاك, as is shown by the rhyme.
(IB, K.)
زويلى, with damm, [app. زُوَّيْلَى, like قُبَّيْطَى
&c., for, as it is not said to be a dim., I know no
other form of word with which to compare it,] A
thing like a ladle, belonging to sailors. (TA.)
زَائِلٌ [Going away; passing away; departing;
transient; shifting; becoming remote, or absent;
ceasing to be or exist; nonexistent: &c.: part. n.
of زَالَ, q. v.]. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] لَيْلٌ زَائِلُ النُّجُومِ [properly A starless night, or night of which the stars
are absent: but expl. as meaning] (assumed tropical:)  a long night.
(Z, TA.) ―
-b3-  زَالَ زَائِلُ الظِّلِّ: see 1.
زَائِلَةٌ [from زَائِلٌ, the ة being affixed to transfer
the word from the category of epithets to that of
substantives,] Whatever has a soul, (K, TA,) of
animals; that moves (يَزُولُ) from its place:
(TA:) or anything that moves; (K, TA;) that
does not remain fixed in its place; applied to a
man and to other things. (TA.) ―
-b2-  زَوَائِلُ is its
pl.: (TA:) and signifies [particularly] Animals
of the chase. (K, TA.) ―
-b3-  And [hence,] (tropical:)  Women.
(O, K, TA.) One says رَجُلٌ رَامِى الزَّوَائِلِ (assumed tropical:)  A
man knowing in respect of the diseases, or faults,
(أَدْوَآء,) of women: (O:) or (tropical:)  skilful in the making
of women to incline to him: whence the saying
of Ibn-Meiyádeh,
وَكُنْتُ امْرَأً أَرْمِى الزَّوَائِلَ مَرَّةً
فَأَصْبَحْتُ قَدْ وَدَعْتُ رَمْىَ الزَّوَائِلِ
(tropical:)  [And I was a man having the art of making
women to incline to me, once; but I have become
such that I have relinquished the art of making
women to incline to me]: this was a man who
used to beguile women in his time of youthful
vigour by his beauty; but when he became hoary
and aged, no woman inclined to him. (TA.) ―
-b4-
Also (tropical:)  The stars: (K, TA:) because of their
motion from the east and the west in their revolving. (TA.) ―
-b5-  See also 1, near the end of the
paragraph; and زَوْلٌ, last sentence but three.
زَوْلٌ أَزْوَلُ (S, * TA) has an intensive signification [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  A great wonder; or a very wonderful
thing]: (TA:) [or a wonderful event that happens
to one, preventing his fleeing;] accord. to Abu-sSemh, أَزْوَلُ denotes the happening to one of an
event such as prevents him from fleeing. (IB, TA.)
مِزْوَلَةٌ A certain instrument pertaining to astronomers, by means of which is known the declining
of the sun from the meridian: [a sun-dial: used
in this sense in the present day:] a vulgar term:
pl. مَزَاوِلُ. (TA.)
مُزَاوَلٌ pass. part. n. of 3: one says, مَا زَالَ هٰذَا

be striven, or sought, to be accomplished by means
of their hands]. (TA.)
