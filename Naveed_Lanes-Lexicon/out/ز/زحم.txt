زحم1
زَحَمَهُ, (Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
زَحَمَ, inf. n. زَحْمٌ
(Msb, K) and زَحْمَةٌ (Msb) and زِحَامٌ, with kesr;
(K; [but see what here follows, and see also زَحْمَةٌ
below;] and ↓ زاحمهُ, (S, Msb, TA,) inf. n. مُزَاحَمَةٌ
(Msb, TA) and زِحَامٌ; (Msb;) i. q. ضَايَقَهُ [i. e.
He straitened him, meaning, in this instance, by
pressure; and properly, being in like manner
straitened by him]: (K in explanation of زَحَمَهُ,
and TA in explanation of زاحمهُ:) or i. q. دَفَعَهُ
[he pushed him, or repelled him]; generally
meaning [he pushed against him] in a strait, or
narrow, [or crowded,] place: (Msb in explanation
of زَحَمَهُ, and app. in explanation of زاحمهُ also:)
[or i. q. دَافَعَهُ, which often signifies the same as
دَفَعَهُ; but more properly, he pushed him, &c.,
being pushed, &c., by him: for] زَحَمَنِىَ النَّاسُ
means دَافَعُونِى [i. e. The people pushed against
me; or pushed me, &c., being pushed, &c., by me;]
in a strait, or narrow, [or crowded,] place: (Mgh:)
[or pressed, crowded, or thronged, me:] and
مُزَاحَمَةٌ is syn. with مُدَافَعَةٌ: (TA in art. دفع:)
↓ اِزْدَحَمَهُ in the place of زَحَمَهُ is a mistake.
(Mgh.) One says, زَحَمَ القَوْمُ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا The
people straitened one another; syn. تَضَايَقُوا; [or
pressed, crowded, or thronged, one another;] in a
sitting-place, or place of assembly: (Msb:) as
also ↓ ازدحموا, (Msb, K, * TA,) in whatever place
it be; (Msb;) and ↓ تزاحموا. (K, * TA.) One
may also use the pass. form of زَحَمَ, i. e. زُحِمَ
[meaning He was straitened, by pressure; &c.];
and that of زَاحَمَ, i. e. ↓ زُوحِمَ [meaning the same].

says, زَاحَمَ عَلَى الرِّئَاسَةِ وَأَرَادَهَا (assumed tropical:)  [He strove for

TA in art. رأس.) [And hence the prov. زَاحِم
بِعَوْدٍ أَوْ دَعْ: see art. عود.] ―
-b3-  [Hence, likewise,]
زاحمهُ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He treated him, or behaved
towards him, with roughness, rudeness, hardness,

TA, but without any reference to the art. from
which I obtained it. It is not in the present art.])

المَوْجِ إِذَا المَوْجُ الْتَطَمْ ↓ تَزَاحُمَ
[He brought a crowd with a crowd, and they
pressed, one against another, like the dashing
together of the waves when the waves beat one
another]: he uses [here] an inf. n. not conformable to the verb. (ISd, TA.)
زُحْمٌ, with damm, a name of Mekkeh: (K, *
TA:) so says Th: but ISd says that the name
commonly known is رُحْم [or أُمُّ رُحْمٍ or أُمُّ الرُّحْمِ]:
(TA:) or it is أُمُّ الزُّحْمِ [probably, I think, a
mistranscription for أُمُّ الرُّحْمِ]. (K, TA.)

i. q. ↓ زِحَامٌ [likewise an inf. n. of زَحَمَهُ accord. to

signify A straitening, pushing, pressing, crowding,
or thronging]. (S.) ―
