زبرجدزَبَرْجَدٌ [The chrysolite; a certain green diaphonous gem;] a well-known gem; (S, Msb, K;) as
also زَبَرْدَجٌ; (TA;) i. q. زُمُرُّذٌ; (S and K in art.
زمرذ;) or said to be so; (Msb;) [but this appears
to be a mistake;] or it is a kind of زُمُرُّذ: (TA:)
the mine in which it receives its being is in the
mine of the زمرّذ, with which it is found; but it is
very rare, more so than the زمرّذ: at the present
period, the year 640 [of the Flight], none whatever of it is found in the mine: some species of it
are of a dark green colour; some, light green;
and some, of a middling hue of green, of a good
water, and very transparent, and these are the
best and the most costly species thereof. (ElTeyfáshee, in De Sacy's Chrest. Arabe, 2nd ed.,
i. 267, q. v.)
