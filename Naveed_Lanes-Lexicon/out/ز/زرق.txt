2
زرّق, accord. to Golius, as on the authority
of the KL, “i. q. Pers. چكانيد, Fecit ut stillaret,
stillatim emisit: ” but it appears from my copy of
the KL that this should be زهّق; for I there find
تَزْهِيقٌ (not تَزْرِيقٌ) expl. by the Pers. چكانيدن:
then, however, immediately follows, in that copy,
another explanation: ―
-b2-  and The shifting backwards of a camel's saddle from his back: therefore it seems that either تَزْرِيقٌ is there omitted
before this second explanation, (see 1, last sentence but one, and see 7,) or تَزْهِيقٌ is there a
mistake for تَزْرِيقٌ.]
