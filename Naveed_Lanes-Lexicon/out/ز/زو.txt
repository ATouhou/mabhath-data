زو1
زُىَّ عَلَيْنَا, or زِىَّ, (accord. to different copies
of the S, in the TA زُىَّ,) [from زَوٌّ, originally
زُوِوَ, then زُوِىَ, and then زُىَّ or زِىَّ,] or it is زُوِىَ,
(thus in some copies of the S,) It was decreed
against us. (S.)

أَزْوَى, (K,) said of a man, (TA,) [from زَوٌّ,]
He came having with him another: (K, and T
in art. تو:) mentioned by Az and Sgh on the
authority of IAar: (TA:) opposed to أَتْوَى meaning “ he came alone; by himself. ” (T in art. تو.)
زَوٌّ A pair, or couple; two coupled together;
(S, K, TA;) [of men, and] of ships and other
things; (TA;) i. q. زَوْجٌ: (K, and T in art. تو:)
opposed to تَوٌّ meaning “ one, and no more. ” (K,
and TA in this art. and in art. تو.) You say,
جَآءَ فُلَانٌ زَوًّا, meaning Such one came with
his companion. (S.) [See also art. تو.]
-A2-  الزَّوُّ
is also the name of A ship constructed by ElMutawekkil, (K, TA,) the 'Abbásee; in which
he associated in drinking with the poet El-Boh-
turee. (TA.) Accord. to the S, it is the name of
a mountain in El-'Irák: but Aboo-Zekereeyà EtTebreezee, and after him the author of the K,
deny this, and suppose J to have been led into
error in asserting such to be the case by the following saying of the poet above mentioned:
وَلَا جَبَلًا كَالزَّوِّ يُوقَفُ تَارَةً
وَيَنْقَادُ إِمَّا قُدْتَهُ بِزِمَامِ
[Nor have I seen a mountain like الزَّوّ, that is
made stationary at one time, and becomes led on
at another time if thou draw it along with a
leading-rope]: J, however, does not say that he
took this from the poetry of El-Bohturee. (TA.
[In the CK, in the verse above cited, اِذْ ما is put
in the place of إِمَّا.])
-A3-  [J also says that,] accord.
to As, زَوُّ المَنِيَّةِ signifies What happens of decreed
perdition or death: and زَوٌّ is also said to signify
a decree [of God]: (S, TA:) and in the M it is
said that زَوٌّ signifies perdition, or death: and زَوُّ
المَنِيَّةِ, the accidents, or calamities, of destiny or
death: but accord. to the T, As said زَوْءُ المَنِيَّةِ,
withء (TA.)
