-b3-  زَبْنٌ also signifies
The selling any fruit upon its trees for [other]
fruit by measure: (K:) whence ↓ المُزَابَنَةُ (see 3):
it has been forbidden, because of the fraud, or
deceit, and the ignorance, attending it: and is thus
termed because either of the two parties, when
he repents, repels the other [if able to do so]
from the obligation that he has imposed upon
him. (TA.)

their fresh ripe state (S, K) upon the heads of
the palm-trees for dried dates (S, Mgh, Msb, K)
by measure; (Mgh, Msb;) which is forbidden,
because it is a sale by conjecture, [or] without measuring and without weighing: (S, TA:) it is from
الزَّبْنُ; because it leads to contention and mutual
repulsion: (Mgh:) and in like manner, the selling
any fruit upon its trees for fruit by measure:

which is a mutual endeavour to endamage, or
overreach, (بَيْعُ مُغَابَنَةٍ,) in a kind in which endamaging, or overreaching, is not allowable; (K;)

overreached, desires to annul the sale, and he who
endamages, or overreaches, desires to make it take
effect, so they repel one another, and contend.

[both app. meaning he esteemed him غَبِين, i. e.
weak in judgment, and therefore liable to be endamaged, or overreached, defrauded, or deceived;
like as استضعفهُ and تضعّفهُ both signify “ he
esteemed him ضَعِيف, i. e. weak ”]; or like اِسْتَغْبَاهُ
and تَغَبَّاهُ [both app. meaning he esteemed him unintelligent, or one having little intelligence]. (TA.)

[He has taken] what he wanted [of the property],
(K,) and مِنَ الطَّعَامِ [of the food]. (TA.)
زَبَنٌ A side; a lateral, or an adjacent, part or
tract or quarter: (K:) [and so, app., ↓ زَبْنٌ and
↓ زِبْنٌ: for] you say, حَلَّ زَبْنًا مِنْ قَوْمِهِ, with
fet-h, [as well as زَبَنًا, with two fet-hahs,] and زِبْنًا,
with kesr, meaning He alighted aside, or apart,

زُبُنَّةٌ The hind leg of a she-camel: (TA:) the
hind legs of the she-camel are called زُبُنَّتَاهَا (K,

(TA.)
زَبُونٌ One who pushes, or thrusts, or who
pushes, or thrusts, away, [or who pushes &c.
much or vehemently, or who is wont to push &c.,]
a thing. (Msb.) A she-camel that pushes, or
thrusts, or that pushes, or thrusts, away, (Mgh,
Msb, K,) or that kicks, or strikes, and pushes,
&c., (S, TA,) her milker, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *)
with her hind leg (Msb) [or with her stifle-joint:
see 1]: or that is wont, or accustomed, to push,
&c., her milker. (TA.) Hence, (A,) one says
حَرْبٌ زَبُونٌ (S, A, Msb, K) meaning (tropical:)  A difficult,
or stubborn, war or battle; likened to the she-camel
termed زبون: (A, TA:) or that dashes men [one
against another], and pushes, or thrusts, them: (S:)
or in which one portion pushes, or thrusts, or pushes
or thrusts away, another, by reason of multitudinousness: (K:) or it is thus called because
it repels the valiant men from advancing, through
fear of death. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  As meaning غَبِىٌّ [i. e.
(assumed tropical:)  Unintelligent, or having little intelligence], and
حَرِيفٌ [syn. with مُعَامِلٌ, and hence, as will be
seen from what follows, app. here used in the
sense of (assumed tropical:)  a dealer with others in buying and
selling, a meaning which مُعَامِلٌ often has, though,
as I have shown in art. حَرف, I do not know any
authority for assigning this meaning to حَرِيفٌ],
(S, K, [the latter explanation thus written in my
copies of the S and in my MS. copy of the K and
in the CK, but in the TA, and hence in the TK,
خريف, which has no meaning, that I know of,
appropriate in this instance,]) it is post-classical,
(K,) not of the language of the people of the
desert: (S:) it signifies (tropical:)  a simpleton, or fool,
who is endamaged, or defrauded, (يُغْبَنُ,) much;
by a tropical attribution [of the meaning of a
pass. part. n. to a word which has properly the
meaning of an act. part. n.; because the person
thus termed is as though he were pushed, or
thrust, away]: (Mgh:) it signifies also (assumed tropical:)  a purchaser; because he pushes away another from the
thing that is sold; [or because he is often duped;]
and in this sense, [a sense in which it is commonly
now used, or as meaning a customer, and also a
dupe,] it is a post-classical word, not of the language of the people of the desert. (Msb.) [The
pl. now commonly used is زَبَائِنُ, and some say
زَبُونَاتٌ.] It is said in a post-classical prov., الزَّبُونُ
يَفْرَحُ بِلَا شَىْءٍ [which I would render (assumed tropical:)  The dupe
rejoices without anything, or at nothing]: (Meyd:)
or الزَّبُونُ يَفْرَحُ بِأَدْنَى شَىْءٍ, meaning [(assumed tropical:)  The dupe
rejoices at the least, or the meanest, thing: or]
the dealer (المُعَامِلُ), or the purchaser (المُشْتَرِى),
as the word signifies in the dial. the people of
El-Basrah. (Har p. 76, q. v. [The editors of the
sec. ed. of De Sacy's Har, to which reference is
here made, say, (Notes, p. 90,) “ Nous pensons
que le mot الزبون, dans l'acception qu'il prend
dans ce proverbe dérive du chaldéen
זַבֵּן 'vendre.'”
(This verb is written in the Lex. of Gesenius
זְבַן.) See also De Sacy's Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed.,
pp. 186 — 190.]
-A2-  Also A well in which is a receding in its مَثَابَة [or place where the water
collects, or place reached by the water when it
returns and collects after one has drawn from it,
&c.; (see art. ثوب;) as though its casing were
pushed back in that part]. (K.)
-A3-  And [An
inner vest; so in the present day; pl. أَزْبِنَةٌ;] a
thing that is cut so as to fit the body, and worn.
(TA.)
زُبَانَى is the sing. of which زُبَانَيَانِ is the dual.
(Mz, 40th نوع.) زُبَانَى العَقْرَبِ signifies The horn
[or claw] of the scorpion: (Msb:) its two horns
[or claws] are called زُبَانَيَا العَقْرَبِ; (S, K;) because it pushes with them. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
الزُّبَانَيَانِ, (Ibn-Kunáseh, S, Kzw,) or زُبَانَيَا العَقْرَبِ,
(K,) [the former the more common,] (assumed tropical:)  The two
horns [or claws] of Scorpio; [which, like the
constellation Leo, the Arabs extended much beyond
the limits that we assign to it, and which they
thus made to include a portion of Libra;] (Kzw;)
two stars, widely separated, (Ibn-Kunáseh, Kzw,)
[that rise] before الإِكْلِيل [q. v.]; (Ibn-Kunáseh;)
between which (Ibn-Kunáseh, Kzw) is the measure
of a spear (رُمْح [q. v.]), more than the stature of
a man, (Ibn-Kunáseh,) [or,] in appearance, the
measure of five cubits: (Kzw:) two bright stars,
(S, K,) in, or upon, (K,) the two horns [or claws]
of Scorpio: (S, K:) [a and g of Libra, accord.
to those who make النَّوْء to mean “ the auroral
setting; ” and perhaps the same, or
α and
β of
Libra, accord to those who make النَّوْء to mean
“ the auroral rising: ”] one of the Mansions of
the Moon, (S, Kzw,) namely, the Sixteenth
Mansion. (Kzw. [See مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل.])
The saying
عَضَّ بِأَطْرَافِ الزُّبَانَى قَمَرُهْ
[lit. His moon bit the extremities of the claw of
Scorpio], cited by IAar, is expl. as meaning “ he
is uncircumcised, except the part from which the
قَمَر has contracted; ” his قُلْفَة being likened to
the زُبَانَى [and his كَمَرَة to the قَمَر]: and he is
related to have said that he who is born when the
moon is in Scorpio is unprosperous: but Th says,
I asked him respecting this saying, and he disallowed it, and said, No, but he is a low, or mean,
or sordid, person, who does not give food in
winter; and when the moon [in winter] bites the
extremities of the زُبَانَى, [i. e. enters Scorpio,] it
is most intense cold. (TA.)
-A2-  See also زَبَانِيَةٌ.
زَبَانٍ: see the next paragraph.
زَبَانِيَةٌ is a pl., of which the sing. is ↓ زِبْنِيَةٌ,
(Akh, Zj, S, K,) as some say, or ↓ زَبَانٍ, (Akh, S,)
or ↓ زُبَانَى, like سُكَارَى, (TA,) or ↓ زَابِنٌ, (Akh, S,)
or ↓ رِبْنِىٌّ, (Ks, K,) the pl. of this last being originally زَبَانِىُّ, the ة [in زَبَانِيَةٌ] being substituted
for the [last] ى: (Bd in xcvi. 18:) but the Arabs
hardly, or in nowise, know this [attribution of a
sing. to زَبَانِيَةٌ], holding it to be a pl. having no
sing., like أَبَابِيلُ and عَبَادِيدُ. (Akh, S.) With
the Arabs [of the classical age] it signifies The
شُرَط [app. in the earlier sense of the braves of an
army, or in the later sense of the armed attendants,
officers, or soldiers, of the prefect of the police]:
(S:) this is the primary signification: (Bd in
xcvi. 18:) the sing. being syn. with شُرْطِىٌّ: and
also signifying the مُتَمَرِّد [i. e. one who exalts
himself, or is insolent and audacious, in pride and
in acts of rebellion or disobedience, &c.,] of the
jinn, or genii, and of mankind: (K:) and i. q.
شَدِيدٌ [i. e. strong, &c.]: (Secr, K:) each of these
two significations [and the first also] being from
the meaning of “ pushing,” or “ thrusting. ” (TA.)
―
-b2-  الزَّبَانِيَةُ signifies also Certain angels, [the tormentors of the damned in Hell,] so called because
of their thrusting the people of the fire thereto;
(Katádeh, S, Msb; *) the angels mentioned in the
Kur [lxvi. 6] as غِلَاظٌ شِدَادٌ, (Zj,) i. e. rough in
speech or in disposition, strong in deeds or in
make. (Bd.)
[
زَبَّانٌ is said by Freytag to signify a foot
(“ pes ”), as on the authority of J; as though he
had found it expl. by the word رِجْل: but this is
a mistake: it is said in the S that زَبَّانٌ is the
name of a man (اِسْمُ رَجُلٍ).]
زِبِّينٌ One striving to suppress the urine and
ordure: (K, * TA: [the word, with the article ال,
is expl. by مُدَافِعُ الأَخْبَثَيْنِ: see 3 in art. دفع, and
see also أَخْبَثُ:]) such is said in a trad. to be one
of those from whom prayer will not be accepted;
or, as some relate it, it is the زِنِّين, with ن [in
the place of the ب]: (TA:) or it means one
withholding them against his will. (K.) ―
-b2-  One
says also, مَا بِهَا زِبِّينٌ, meaning There is not in it
[i. e. the house, الدَّار,] any one: so says Aboo-Shubrumeh. (TA.)
زَبُّونَةٌ Pride; syn. كِبْرٌ. (S.) ―
-b2-  And [hence,
probably,] رَجُلٌ ذُو زَبُّونَةٍ i. q. مَانِعٌ جَانِبَهُ [app.
meaning A man who defends his honour, or reputation: see جَانِبٌ]: (S, TA:) or a man who
defends what is behind his back (مَا وَرَآءَ ظَهْرِهِ
[perhaps meaning his household: see ظَهْرٌ]). (TA,
and so in a copy of the S.)
-A2-  Also, and ↓ زُبُّونَةٌ,
The neck; (IAar, K;) as in the saying خُذْ
بِقُرُونِهِ وَبِزَبُّونَتِهِ [Take thou hold of his horns and
his neck]: (IAar, TA:) or زَبُّونَةٌ may signify the
ear; and the pl. زَبُّونَاتٌ, the head and neck of a
horse, by a metonymy, because the ears are
therein. (Ham p. 58, q. v.)
زُبُّونَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
زَابِنٌ: see زَبَانِيَةٌ, first sentence.
زَابِنَةٌ An [eminence such as is termed] أَكَمَة,
(K, TA,) raised high (TA) in a valley that bends,
or turns, from it; (K, TA;) as though it pushed
it, or thrust it, away. (TA.)
