زنى1
زَنَى, aor. يَزْنِى, inf. n. زِنًى [often written زِنًا]
and زِنَآءٌ, (S, Mgh, * Msb, K,) the latter an inf. n.
of 3 (S, Mgh, Msb, K) also, (S, Mgh, K,) but said
by some to be a dial. var. of the former, (Msb,) the
former being of the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz,
(Lh, S, Msb, TA,) and the latter of the dial. of
Benoo-Temeem, (Lh, TA,) or of the people of
Nejd, (S, Msb, TA,) He committed fornication
or adultery; (El-Munáwee, Er-Rághib, TA;) بِهَا
with her: (MA:) but accord. to El-Munáwee,
[it seems to be properly a dial. var. of زَنَأَ as
meaning he mounted; for he says that,] in the
proper language of the Arabs, الزِّنَا signifies the
mounting upon a thing; and in the language of
the law it signifies the commission of the act
first mentioned above: it is [thus] syn. with فَجَرَ:
and in like manner one says of a woman [زَنَتْ]:
(TA:) ↓ زنّى, inf. n. تَزْنِيَةٌ, also signifies the same:
(TA:) and so does ↓ زانى, inf. n. مُزَانَاةٌ and زِنَآءٌ:
(K:) one says of a woman, ↓ تُزَانِى, inf. n. مُزَانَاةٌ
and زِنَآءٌ, meaning تُبَاغِى [i. e. She commits fornication or adultery; or prostitutes herself]. (S.)
It is said in a prov., لَا حُصْنُهَا حُصْنٌ وَلَا الزِّنَآءُ زِنَآءٌ
[Her continence is not continence, nor the fornication, or adultery, that she commits, fornication,
or adultery]: applied to him who does not remain
in one state, or condition; neither in good nor in
evil: (Meyd:) or to him who refrains from doing
good and then is excessive [therein], or from evil
and then is excessive therein; not continuing to
pursue one way. (TA.) [See also زَنْيَةٌ.]

زنّاهُ, inf. n. تَزْنِيَةٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) He
said to him يَا زَانِى [O fornicator or adulterer]:
(S, TA:) or he imputed to him الزِّنَا [i. e. fornication or adultery]; (Mgh, Msb, TA;) and so
↓ زاناهُ, accord. to the copies of the K; but in the
M, ↓ ازناهُ, which, it is there said, has not been
heard except in a trad. of the daughter of El-
Hasan. (TA.)

زِنًى, often written زِنًا: see the next paragraph,
in two places.
زَنْيَةٌ A single act of الزِّنَى [i. e. fornication or
adultery]: (Msb, TA:) and ↓ زِنًى is [used in the
same sense, (though properly an inf. n., not of
un.,) as is shown by its being] dualized: they say
زِنَيَانِ: (TA:) [but this is post-classical:] thus
using the dual of زِنًى, the lawyers say, قَذَفَهُ بِزِنَيَيْنِ
[He reproached him with two acts of fornication
or adultery]: (Msb, TA:) but [in this instance,
and] in the saying ↓ شَهِدَ عَلَى زِنَاءَيْنِ, [which is
dual of زِنَآءٌ, properly an inf. n. like زِنًى,] or زِنَيَيْنِ,
[He testified, or gave decisive information, respecting two acts of fornication or adultery,] the
right word is زَنْيَتَيْنِ. (Mgh.) One says also, هُوَ
ابْنُ زَنْيَةٍ, and sometimes ↓ زِنْيَةٍ, (K,) but the
former is the more chaste, (Az, TA,) meaning
↓ ابْنُ زِنًى [i. e. He is a son of fornication or
adultery]: (K:) or هُوَ وَلَدُ زَنْيَةٍ and ↓ زِنْيَةٍ, (Mgh,
Msb,) and لِزَنْيَةٍ [هُوَ] and ↓ لِزِنْيَةٍ, (Mgh,) with fet-h
and with kesr, [meaning as above, or وُلِدَ لِزَنْيَةٍ
He is, or was, born of fornication or adultery,]
contr. of وَلَدُ رِشْدَةٍ and لِرِشْدَةٍ, (Mgh,) or contr. of
هُوَ لِرِشْدَةٍ: (Msb:) or ↓ هُوَ لِزِنْيَةٍ and لِزَنْيَةٍ, [He
is the offspring of fornication or adultery,] contr.
of لِرِشْدَةٍ and لِرَشْدَةٍ: (S:) accord. to Fr, one says,
هُوَ لِغَيِّةٍ and لِزَنْيَةٍ and لِغَيْرِ رَشْدَةٍ, [all meaning the
same, and] all with fet-h: accord. to Ks, however, one may say ↓ زِنْيَة and رِشْدَة, with kesr, but
غَيَّة only with fet-h: (TA:) ISk says that زنية
and غيّة are both with kesr and fet-h. (Msb.)
زِنْيَةٌ [accord. to analogy signifies A mode, or
manner, of fornication or adultery]. See the next
preceding paragraph, in five places.
-A2-  Also The
last of a man's children; (K;) like as فِجْرَةٌ signifies the “ last of a woman's children. ” (TA.)
زِنَآءٌ [properly an inf. n., but having a dual
assigned to it]: see an instance of its dual voce
زَنْيَةٌ
زِنَوِىٌّ [meaning Of, or relating to, fornication
or adultery] is the rel. n. from زِنًى; (S, Msb;)
the [radical] ى being changed into و because
three ىs are deemed difficult of pronunciation:
(Msb:) and the rel. n. from زِنَآءٌ [having the same
meaning] is ↓ زِنَآئِىٌّ. (S.)
زِنَائِىٌّ: see what next precedes.
زَنَّآءَةٌ an appellation applied to A female ape
(قِرْدَةٌ). (S.)
زَانٍ act. part. n. of زَنَى: [signifying Committing fornication or adultery: and also a fornicator or an adulterer:] (Msb:) fem. زَانِيَةٌ:
(Kur xxiv. 2 and 3:) pl. masc. زُنَاةٌ, like قُضَاةٌ pl.
of قَاضٍ: (Msb:) [and pl. fem. زَوَانٍ.] يَا زَانِى
said to a woman is correct as being [for يَا زَانِيَةُ,
O fornicatress, or adulteress,] apocopated. (Mgh.)
زَانِيَةٌ fem. of زَانٍ [q. v.] ―
-b2-  Applied to a man,
it has an intensive meaning [i. e. One much addicted to fornication or adultery]. (Mgh.)
