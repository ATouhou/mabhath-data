religion; (KL;) [a disbeliever in the world to
come and in the Deity, or the unity of the Creator: (see زَنْدَقَةٌ:) and an asserter of the endlessness of time: see زِنْدِيقٌ.]
زَنْدَقٌ, (Th, O, L, K, [in some of the copies of
the K, and in my copy of the Msb, زِنْدِيقٌ,
which, as is said in the TA, is a mistake,]) and
↓ زَنْدَقِىٌّ, A man very niggardly or avaricious.
(Th, O, L, K, Msb.)
زَنْدَقَةٌ a subst from the verb above mentioned;
(S, K;) [The adoption, or belief, or profession, of
the tenets of the زِنْدِيق: generally, deviation from
the right religion, or the impugning of religious,
and the state of him who is without religion;]
disbelief in the world to come and in [the Deity,
or] the unity of the Creator: (T, Mgh, Msb:)
[and the assertion of the endlessness of time: see
زِنْدِيقٌ.] ―
-b2-  Also i. q. ضِيقٌ [as meaning Niggardliness, or avarice: see زَنْدَقٌ]. (L, TA.)
زَنْدَقِىٌّ: see زَنْدَقٌ.
زُنْدُوقٌ a dial. var. of صُنْدُوقٌ [q. v.]; (K;) like
as قَزْدٌ is of قَصْدٌ. (TA.)
زِنْدِيقٌ One who is of the ثَنَوِيَّة [or asserters of
the doctrine of Dualism]: (S, O, K:) or one who
asserts his belief in [the two principles of] Light
and Darkness: or one who does not believe in the
world to come, nor in the Deity: (O, K:) or one
who does not believe in the world to come nor in
the unity of the Creator: (T, Msb:) or one who
conceals unbelief and makes an outward show of
belief: (K:) an arabicized word, (S, Msb,) originally Pers., so they say, (Msb,) from الزَّنْدُ, which
is a book belonging to them [i. e. the book of
Zoroaster]: (PS:) [or from the Pers. زَنْدِيك,
meaning magian, or fire-worshipper: and this
seems to be its primary meaning; as De Sacy
says in his “ Chrest. Ar.,” 2nd ed., ii. 274:] or,
accord. to IDrd, it is an arabicized word from the
Persian زِنْدَه, (Mgh, [thus in my copy, app. for
زَنْدَهْ, in which the ه may be, as it is in many
other instances, an affix denoting some kind of
relationship,]) or زَنْدَ كِرْ, (TA, as from the L,
[but not very clearly written, and with an erasure,
such as to suggest that the original and right
reading may be زَنْدْ گِيرْ, which may be rendered
holder of the Zend, but]) which is expl. as meaning he [who] asserts his belief in the eternity, or
the endlessness, of the present world: (Mgh, TA:)
or it is arabicized from زَنْ دِين i. e. woman's
religion: (O, K:) or the right explanation is
this: that it is a term of relation to the زَنْد, which
is the book of Mánee the Magian, who was in
the time of Bahrám the son of Hurmuz the son of
Sáboor [or Shápoor], and who claimed to be
successor to the Messiah, on whom be peace;
and, desiring fame, composed this book, which
he hid in a tree, and then took forth: الزَّنْدُ, in
their language, is “ explanation; ” and he meant
that this was the explanation of the book of Zará-
dusht [or Zoroaster] the Persian; and in it he
held that there are two gods, Light and Darkness,
Light creating good, and Darkness creating evil:
(TA:) or, accord. to the “ Mefáteeh el-'Uloom,”
زِنْدِيقٌ means a follower of Mánee, and also a
follower of Mezdek, who (i. e. Mezdek) appeared in the days of Kubádh, and asserted that
possessions and women were in common, and put
forth a book which he called زند, which is the
book of the Magians, that was brought by Zará-
dusht, whom they assert to have been a prophet:
and the companions of Mezdek were named in
relation to [this] زند; which word, being arabicized, was converted into زِنْدِيقٌ: (Mgh:) Th says
that زِنْدِيقٌ is not of the [genuine] language of the
Arabs; (Mgh, TA;) and when the Arabs desire
to express the meaning in which it is commonly
used, (Mgh, * Msb, TA,) which is one who does
not hold any religion, and who asserts his belief
in the endlessness of time, (Msb,) they say مُلْحِدٌ,
(Mgh, Msb, TA,) i. e. [a deviater from the right
religion, or] an impugner of religions, (Msb,)
and دَهْرِىٌّ: (Mgh, TA:) some say that it is from
الزَّنْدَقَةُ; because the زنديق straitens himself: (L,
TA:) an Arab of the desert is related to have explained it as meaning one who looks much into
things, or affairs: (Msb:) the pl. is زَنَادِقَةٌ and
زَنَادِيقُ; (S, O, Msb, K;) the latter being the
original pl., and the ة of the former being a
substitute for the suppressed ى of the latter.
(S, O.)
