زعج1
زَعَجَ: see 4. ―
-b2-  Also i. q. طَرَدَ [He drove
away, &c.]. (K.)
-A2-  And [i. q. زَعَقَ, meaning]
He called, called out, cried out, or shouted. (K.)
4
ازعجهُ He disquieted, disturbed, agitated, or
flurried, him; (IDrd, S, K;) and removed him
from his place: (S, A, Msb, K:) and ↓ زَعَجَهُ
signifies the same. (IDrd, K.) You say, أَزْعَجْتُهُ
عَنْ مَوْضِعِهِ, (Msb,) or مِنْ مَحَلِّهِ, (A,) and مِنْ
بِلَادِهِ, (L,) I removed him, or unsettled him,
from his place, and from his country. (A, L,
Msb.) And it is said in a trad., رَأَيْتُ عُمُرَ يُزْعِجُ أَبَا
بَكْرٍ, meaning I saw 'Omar rousing Aboo-Bekr,
and not suffering him to remain still. (TA.)
And in another, الحَلِفُ يُزْعِجُ السِّلْعَةَ وَيَحْمَقُ البَرَكَةَ,
meaning, accord. to Az, [Swearing] lowers in
estimation [the commodity that one desires to
recommend thereby and does away with the
blessing thereof]: or, accord. to IAth, causes it to
be easy of sale and to go forth from the hand of
its owner [but does away with the blessing thereof]. (TA.) إِزْعَاجٌ [is the inf. n.; and as inf. n. of
the pass. verb,] signifies [The being disquieted, &c.;
and hence,] the quitting of home. (Har p. 392.)
7
انزعج He was, or became, disquieted, disturbed, agitated, or flurried; (S, K;) and was,
or became, removed, or unsettled, from his place:
(S, A, L, Msb, K:) it may be thus used as quasipass. of ازعج: (Kh, Msb:) or it should not be
so used: (Msb:) it is, however, agreeable with
analogy, as is also ↓ ازدعج: (L:) but the word
commonly used in its stead is شَخَصَ: (L, Msb:)
زَعَجَ in this sense is not allowable. (L.)
8
ازدعج: see what next precedes.
زَعَجٌ Disquietude, disturbance, or agitation:
(K, TA:) a subst. [not an inf. n.] in this sense.
(TA.)
مِزْعَاجٌ An unquiet woman, who remains not
still, or settled, in one place. (S, A, K.)
