زيل1
زَالَهُ is syn. with أَزَالَهُ, q. v. (S, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-
زال زَوَالَهُ, or زال اللّٰهُ زَوَالَهُ; and زال زَوَالَهَا: see
زَوَالٌ, in art. زول. And زِيلَ زَوِيلُهُ and زَوِيلُهَا and
زَوَالُهُ: see زَوِيلٌ, in art. زول; and for the first,
see also زَوَالٌ, in that art. ―
-b3-  زِلْتُهُ, (S, K,) aor.
أَزِيلُهُ, inf. n. زَيْلٌ, (S,) [first pers. of زَالَهُ,] signifies
also I put it, or set it, apart, away, or aside;
removed it; or separated it; (S, K, TA;) namely,
a thing, (S, TA,) from another thing: (TA:)
and ↓ ازالهُ also signifies he separated it; like زَالَهُ.
(TA.) See also 4. One says, زِلْ ضَأْنَكَ مِنْ مِعْزَاكَ
Remove, or separate, thy sheep from thy goats.
(S, * TA.) And ↓ زِلْتُهُ فَلَمْ يَنْزَلْ I separated it
[partly], but it did not become [wholly] separated.
(S, K.)
-A2-  مَا زَالَ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا (S in art. زول, and
Msb,) is like مَا بَرِحَ, both in its [original] measure,
[which is مَا زَيِلَ accord. to most authorities,] and
in its meaning, which is [He ceased not to do
such a thing, or he continued to do such a thing,
for it denotes] the continuing to do a thing [as in
the ex. above], and a constant state [as in the
phrase مَا زَالَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا Zeyd ceased not to be, or
continued to be, standing]: (Msb:) [using the
first pers.,] one says, مَا زِلْتُ أَفْعَلُهُ [and مَا زَلْتُ,
as appears from what follows], meaning مَا بَرِحْتُ
[i. e. I ceased not to do it,  or I continued to do
it], (K,) aor. أَزَالُ [supposing the measure of the
pret. to be originally فَعِلْتُ] (Msb, K) and أَزِيلُ
[supposing the measure of the pret. to be originally
فعَلْتُ]: (K:) the verb is seldom [in the Msb
“ never ”] used without a negative particle: (Az,
TA:) one says زِلْتُ أَفْعَلُ meaning مَا زِلْتُ أَفْعَلُ;
but this is rare: (K:) and مَا زِيلَ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا,
(S, Msb, K,) a phrase used by some of the Arabs,
(Msb,) mentioned by Akh, (S, TA,) as is meant
in [some of the copies of] the K by the addition
عَنْهُ, though Akh is not mentioned in what precedes. (TA.) The verb in مَا زَالَ and لَا يَزَالُ is
used in the manner of كَانَ in governing the
noun [which is its subject] in the nom. case and
the predicate in the accus. case [as in مَا زَالَ زَيْدٌ
قَائِمًا, expl. above]; but one may not say, مَا زَالَ
زَيْدٌ إِلَّا مُنْطَلِقًا, like as one says, مَا كَانَ زَيْدٌ إِلَّا
مُنْطَلِقًا; for زَالَ denotes a negation, [meaning he
did not a thing, or he was not doing &c.,] and
مَا and لَا denote negation, and two negations together denote an affirmation; so that ما زال is
affirmative like كَانَ; and as one may not say,
كَانَ زَيْدٌ إِلَّا مَنْطَلِقًا, so one may not say, مَا زَالَ
زَيْدٌ إِلَّا مُنْطَلِقًا. (Er-Rághib, TA.) One says also,
مَا زِلْتُ بِزَيْدٍ حَتَّى فَعَلَ ذٰلِكَ and مَا زِلْتُ وَزَيْدًا [I
desisted not with Zeyd until he did that], (Sb, K, *
TA,) inf. n. زِيَالٌ. (Sb, TA.) لَمْ يَزَلْ [He,  or it,
has not ceased to be &c., i. e., has ever been &c.,
(see أَزَلٌ,)] is said of God, as meaning He has
never been nonexistent; and لَا يَزَالُ, said of Him,
He will never be nonexistent. (Kull p. 31.) This
[incomplete i. e. non-attributive] verb and the complete [i. e. attributive, which signifies “ it ceased
to be ” or “ exist,” &c.,] differ in their components; the latter being composed of ل و ز; and
this, of ل ى ز: or the incomplete is altered from
the complete; being made to be with kesr to its
medial radical letter, [for it is generally held to be
from زَيِلَ or زَوِلَ,] after its having been [originally زَوَلَ,] with fet-h: or it is from زَالَهُ, aor.
يَزِيلُهُ, meaning “ he put it,” or “ set it, apart,” &c.
(K.)
2
زيّلهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَزْيِيلٌ, (S,) He separated
it [i. e. acompany of men, or an assemblage of things,]
much (Fr, Az, S, * K, * TA,) [or greatly, or widely;
or dispersed it;] differing in degree from زَالَهُ like as
مَيَّزَهُ does from مَازَهُ. (TA.) Hence, فَزَيَّلْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ
[And we will separate them widely, one from
another], (Fr, Az, S, K, TA,) in the Kur [x. 29];
(Fr, Az, S, TA;) where some read بَيْنَهُمْ ↓ فَزَايَلْنَا;
like لَا تُصَعِّرْ and لا تُصَاعِرْ [in the Kur xxxi. 17].
(Fr, Az, TA.) [See also an ex. in a verse cited
voce دُونَ.] زَيَّلْتُ is of the measure فَعَّلْتُ because
its inf. n. is as above; for were it فَيْعَلْتُ, one
would say زَيَّلَةٌ [of the measure فَيْعَلَةٌ]. (S.)
-A2-
تَزْيِيلٌ is also [said to be] an [irreg.] inf. n. of 5,
q. v. (Lh, K.)
3
زايلهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. مُزَايَلَةٌ and زِيَالٌ,
(S, K,) He separated himself from him. (S, Msb,
K. [See also 1 in art. زول, last signification.])
One says, خَالِطُوا النَّاسَ وَزَايِلُوهُمْ, meaning [Mix
ye with men in familiar, or social, intercourse,
and] separate yourselves from them in deeds, or
actions. (TA.) ―
-b2-  زَايَلَتْهُ بِوَجْهِهَا She veiled her
face from him. (IAar on the authority of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr, TA in art. بزر.) [See also 6.] ―
-b3-
زَايَلْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ: see 2. And see also what next
follows.
4
ازالهُ (S, Msb, K) مِنْ مَكَانِهِ (S) or عَنْ مَكَانِهِ,
(K,) inf. n. إِزَالَةٌ (K) and إِزَالٌ; (Lh, K;) and
↓ زَالَهُ, (S, Msb, K, and Har p. 393,) aor. يَزِيلُهُ,
(S, K, and Har ubi suprà,) or يَزَالُهُ, like يَنَالُهُ,
(Msb,) inf. n. زَيْلٌ, (S, K, Har,) or زِيَالٌ; (Msb;)
both signify the same; (S, Msb, K;) He removed
it [from its place; as the former is expl. in art.
زول]; (Msb in explanation of both, and Har
ubi suprà in explanation of the latter;) and so
↓ زَايَلَهُ, of which the primary signification is that
first assigned to it in the next preceding paragraph. (Har ubi suprà.) See also 1, fourth sentence. [And see 4 in art. زول.]
5
تزيّلوا, (S, * Msb, K,) inf. n. تَزَيُّلٌ and ↓ تَزْيِيلٌ,
(K,) the latter [irreg., being properly inf. n. of
2,] of the dial. of El-Hijáz, mentioned by Lh;
(TA;) and ↓ تزايلوا, inf. n. تَزَايُلٌ; (K;) i. q.
تَفَرَّقُوا [i. e. They became separated much, or
greatly, or widely; or became dispersed: or rather,
the former verb, being quasi-pass. of 2, has this
meaning; and the latter verb, as quasi-pass. of 3,
means simply they became separated, one from
another]: (S, K:) [for] ↓ التَّزَايُلُ signifies التَّبَايُنُ:
(S, K:) تزيّلوا is syn. with تَمَيَّزُوا: thus in the
Kur [xlviii. 25], where it is said, لَوْ تَزَيَّلُوا لَعَذَّبْنَا
الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا [Had they been widely separated,
one from another, we had assuredly punished
those who disbelieved]: (Msb, * TA:) and some
here read ↓ تَزَايَلُوا. (Bd.) [See also 7.]
6
تَزَاْيَلَ see 5, in three places. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] التَّزَايُلُ
signifies also الاِحْتِشَامُ; (K, TA;) a tropical meaning: (TA:) one says, تزايل عَنْهُ, meaning اِحْتَشَمَهُ
[i. e. (tropical:)  He was, or became, abashed at him]: (O,
TA:) because the مُحْتَشِم separates himself, and
shrinks, from another. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [See also مُتَزَايِلَةٌ,
whence it seems that one says, of a woman,
تَزَايَلَتْ, meaning She veiled her face from men:
see likewise 3.]
7
انزال It was, or became, put, or set, apart,
away, or aside; removed; or separated; (S, K;)
عَنْهُ [from him, or it]. (TA.) One says, زِلْتُهُ
فَلَمْ يَنْزَلْ: see 1. (S, K.) [See also 5. And see
7 in art. زول.]
زَيَلٌ Width between the thighs; (S, K;) like
فَجَجٌ. (S.)
أَزْيَلٌ, (K,) or أَزْيَلُ الفَخِذَيْنِ, occurring in a
trad., (TA,) Having the thighs wide apart.
(K, TA.)
مِزْيَلٌ A man acute or sharp or quick in intellect, clever, ingenious, skilful, knowing, or
intelligent; knowing with respect to the subtilties,
niceties, abstrusities, or obscurities, of things,
affairs, or cases; as also ↓ مِزْيَالٌ: (K:) or vehement in altercation, or litigation, who shifts
(يَزُولُ) from one plea, or argument, to another:
occurring in a trad., in which it is said, with
reference to two claimants, كَانَ أَحَدُهُمَا مِخْلَطًا
مِزْيَلًا [One of them two was a person who mixed
in, or entered into, affairs; vehement in altercation, &c.]: (IAth, TA:) accord. to which latter
explanation, it should be mentioned in art. زول,
as it is by the author of the L; but Z mentions it
in the present art., like F. (TA.)
مِزْيَالٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
الجيب المُزَايِلُ [a mistranscription for الحَبِيبُ]
means البَائِنُ [i. e. The beloved, or the friend, who
is in a state of separation, or disunion]. (TA.)
مُتَزَايِلَةٌ A woman who veils her face from men.
(IAar on the authority of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr, TA in
this art. and in art. برز.)
