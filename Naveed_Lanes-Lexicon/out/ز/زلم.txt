زلم1
زَلَمَ, (aor.
زَلُمَ, inf. n. زَلْمٌ, TK,) He cut off one's
nose [and app. anything projecting, or prominent:
see 2: and see also 8]. (ISh, K.) ―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  He made
his gift little, or small, in quantity or amount;
(S, K;) [as though he cut off something from it;]
in [some of the copies of] the S, [but not so in
mine,] ↓ زلّم. (TA.) ―
-b3-  He filled (S, K) a water-ing-trough, or tank, (S,) or a vessel; (K;) as

2
زلّم السَّهْمَ, (S, K, *) inf. n. تَزْلِيمٌ, (K,) He cut
[or pared] the arrow, and made its proportion or
conformation, and its workmanship, good: (S:)
[he shaped it well:] or he made it even and
supple. (K.) And زُلِّمَ is said of anything as
meaning Its edges were pared off. (TA.) [Hence,]
زلّم الرَّحَى He made the mill-stone round, and took
from its edges. (K.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says,
كَأَرْحَآءِ رَقْدٍ زَلَّمَتْهَا المَنَاقِرُ
[Like the mill-stones of Rakd (a mountain so
called) which the picks have rounded by taking
from their edges]: he likens the foot of the camel
to a mill-stone from the edges of which the مَعَاوِل
have taken, (S, TA,) and which they have made
even. (TA.) And زَلَّمْتُ الحَجَرَ signifies I cut
the stone, and prepared it properly for a millstone. (TA.) ―

And He extirpated one's nose. (K.)
زَلْمٌ or زُلْمٌ, whence the phrase هُوَ العَبْدُ زَلْمًا:
see زَلْمَة.
زَلَمٌ and ↓ زُلَمٌ An arrow without a head and
without feathers: pl. أَزْلَامٌ: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:)
which was applied to those [divining-] arrows by
means of which the Arabs in the Time of Ignorance sought to know what was allotted to
them: (S, K:) they were arrows upon which the
Arabs in the Time of Ignorance wrote “ Command ” and “ Prohibition; ” (Mgh, Msb;) or
upon some of which was written “ My Lord hath
commanded me; ” and upon some, “My Lord
hath forbidden me; ” (Har p. 465;) or they were
three arrows; upon one of which was written
“ My Lord hath commanded me; ” and upon
another, “My Lord hath forbidden me; ” and
the third was blank; (Bd in v. 4;) and they put
them in a receptacle, (Mgh, Msb,) and when any
one of them desired to make a journey, or to
accomplish a want, (Mgh,) or when he desired to
perform some affair, (Msb,) he put his hand into
that receptacle, (Mgh, Msb,) and took forth an
arrow; (Msb;) and if the arrow upon which was
“ Command ” [or “ My Lord hath commanded
me ” (Har ubi suprà)] came forth, he went to
accomplish his purpose; but if that upon which
was “ Prohibition ” [or “ My Lord hath forbidden me ” (Har)] came forth, he refrained;
(Mgh, Msb;) and if the blank came forth, they
shuffled them a second time: (Bd ubi suprà:) or,
as some say, the ازلام were white pebbles, upon
which they thus wrote, and by means of which
they sought to know what was allotted to them in
the manner expl. above: (Har ubi suprà:) or,
accord. to Az, the ازلام [were arrows that] belonged to Kureysh, in the Time of Ignorance,
upon which were written “ He hath commanded ”
and “ He hath forbidden,” and “ Do thou ” and
“ Do thou not; ” they had been well shaped
(زُلِّمَتْ) and made even, and placed in the Kaabeh,
the ministers of the House taking care of them;
and when a man desired to go on a journey, or to
marry, he came to the minister, and said, “Take
thou forth for me a زلم; ” and thereupon he would
take it forth, and look at it; and if the arrow of
command came forth, he went to accomplish that
which he had purposed to do; but if the arrow of
prohibition came forth, he refrained from that
which he desired to do: [it is said that] there
were seven of the arrows thus called with the
minister of the Kaabeh, having marks upon them,
and used for this purpose: (Jel in v. 4:) and
sometimes there were with the man two such
arrows, which he put into his sword-case; and
when he desired to seek the knowledge of what
was allotted to him, he took forth one of them.
(TA.) Some say that the أَزْلَام are The arrows of
the game called المَيْسِر: but this is a mistake.
(TA.) The seeking to obtain the knowledge of
what is allotted to one by means of the ازلام is
forbidden in the Kur v. 4. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence,
أَزْلَامُ البَقَرَةِ (tropical:)  The legs of the [wild] ox or cow:
likened to the arrows called ازلام because of their
slenderness: or, accord. to the A, because of their
strength and hardness. (TA.) [Hence, likewise,]
the former of the two words (زَلَمٌ) signifies also
(assumed tropical:)  A strong and light or active boy: pl. as above:
(TA:) [app. because] a poet likens [such] a boy
to an arrow of the kind thus called. (S, TA. *)
-A2-  Also, both words, (K,) the latter on the authority of Kr, (TA,) A cloven hoof: (K:) accord.
to some, peculiarly of the ox-kind: (TA:) or the
[projecting] thing that is behind it: (S, K:) pl.
as above. (K, * TA.)
-A3-  And the latter of the
same two words, (AA, S,) or each of them, (K,)
[The hyrax Syriacus;] one of the [animals
called] وِبَار [pl. of وَبْرٌ]: pl. as above. (AA, S, K.)
زُلَمٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, throughout.
هُوَالعَبْدُ زَلْمَةً and ↓ زُلْمَةً and ↓ زَلَمَةً and ↓ زُلَمَةً,

or conformation, (S, K,) or whose cut, (K,) is
that of the slave: (S, K:) or he is the slave in
truth: (Ks, S:) or he resembles the slave as

said, ↓ هو العبد مَزْلُومًا, i. e. he is the slave, being
thus created by God, so that every one who looks
at him sees the characteristics of the slaves impressed upon him: and it is a prov. applied to
him who is low, ignoble, or mean: (Meyd:)
[i. e.,] one says thus in disapproval (فى النكرة
[i. e. فِى النَّكَرَةِ] or فى النَّكِرَةِ): (Lh: so in different
copies of the S:) and in like manner one says of
the female slave [هِىَ الأَمَةُ زَلْمَةً &c.]: (Lh, S, K:)
As said, هُوَ العَبْدُ زَلْمَةُ, using the nom. case, without tenween; but IAar said, هو العبد زَلْمَةً, using
the accus. case, with tenween: so in the handwriting of 'Abd-Es-Selám El-Basree: (TA:) and
accord. to Lh, one says, يَا فَتَى ↓ هٰذَا العَبْدُ زَلْمًا,
(so in some copies of the S,) or ↓ زُلْمًا, (so in other
copies of the S, and in the TA,) with damm,
(TA,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  This is the slave in proportion,
or conformation, and in cut, O young man: (S,
TA:) or, as some say, the meaning is, truly.
(TA.)
زُلْمَة: see the next preceding paragraph.
زَلَمَةٌ [A kind of wattle]: زَلَمَتَا العَنْزِ means the

زَلَمَةٌ signifies a certain appertenance of goats; a
thing hanging from their حُلُوق [here meaning
throats, externally,] like the [kind of ear-ring
called] قُرْط; the animal having two of such things:

of زَلَمَةٌ expl. above]. (S.) ―

original meaning; (TA;) and so ↓ المُزَلَّمُ: (K:

words الوَعِلُ and الصَّغِيرُ الجُثَّةِ:]) and الزَّلْمَآءُ signifies The female mountain-goat. (Kr, K.) ―
-b3-  And

though it were] always جَذَع, not becoming old,
(TA,) (tropical:)  Time, or fortune, (S, K,) that is hard, or
rigorous, (K,) in its course, (TA,) abounding
with trials (K) and deaths: accord. to Yaakoob,
