زهو1
زَهَا, said of seed-produce, It increased, or
augmented; received increase and blessing from
God; or throve by the blessing of God: (JK,
TA:) [or,] said of herbage, aor. يَزْهُو, inf. n. زَهْوٌ,
it attained its full growth: (Msb:) or it put
forth its fruit: or it became tall: (TA:) and,
said of palm-trees, (نَخْلٌ, S, Msb, K, TA,) and
likewise of plants, (TA,) aor. as above, (Msb,
TA,) and so the inf. n., (S, Msb, TA,) they
became tall; (K, TA;) became tall and fullgrown; or became of their full height, and
blossomed; (TA;) and ↓ ازهى signifies the same:
(K:) or both signify they (i. e. palm-trees) showed
redness, and yellowness, in their fruit; (S, Msb;)
the latter verb mentioned by AZ, but [it is said
that] As did not know it: (S: [see, however,
what follows:]) or, as some say, the former signifies they put forth their fruit; and ↓ the latter,
as expl. next before: (Msb:) accord. to Abu-lKhattáb and Lth, one says of palm-trees (نَخْل)
only يُزْهِى; not يَزْهُو: and As [is related to have]
said, [contr. to what has been asserted of him
above,] that when redness appears in [the fruit
of] palm-trees, one says ازهى. (TA.) And زَهَا
التَّمْرُ, (JK,) or البُسْرُ; and ↓ ازهى; (Mgh, K;)
and ↓ زهّى, (K,) inf. n. تَزْهِيَةٌ; (TA;) [The dates,
or dates beginning to ripen,] showed their goodness by redness, and yellowness: (JK:) became
red, and yellow: (Mgh:) became coloured. (K.)
Hence the trad., نَهَى عَنْ بَيْعِ ثَمَرِ النَّخْلِ حَتَّى يَزْهُوَ,
or ↓ يُزْهِىَ, [He forbade the selling of the fruit of
the palm-trees until its becoming red or yellow],
thus differently related. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  You say also,
زَهَا الغُلَامُ, (K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,)
The boy grew up; or attained to youthful vigour,
or the prime of manhood. (K.) ―
-b3-  And زَهَتِ
الشَّاةُ, (JK, S, K,) aor. as above, (S,) and so the
inf. n., (JK, S,) The ewe, or she-goat, became
large in her udder: (JK:) or secreted milk in
her udder, and was near to bringing forth. (AZ,
S, K. *) ―
-b4-  And زَهَتِ الرِّيحُ The wind rose, blew,
or became in a state of commotion. (S.) ―
-b5-  And
زَهَتِ الإِبِلُ, (JK, S, M, K,) aor. as above, (JK,
M,) and so the inf. n., (S, M,) The camels journeyed, after coming to water, (JK, S, M, K,) a
night or more, (JK, S, M,) so says A'Obeyd, (S,)
or a night or two nights. (K.) And The camels
passed along, (مَرَّت,) so in the copies of the K,
but correctly مَدَّت [i. e. made much advance in
journeying], as in the M, (TA,) in search of
pasturage, after they had drunk, (K, TA,) not
pasturing around the water. (TA.) The verb
used in relation to camels is also trans., as will
be shown below. (S, &c.)
-A2-  زَهْوٌ [as inf. n. of the
trans. v. زَهَا, aor. يَزْهَى,] primarily signifies The
act of raising, or elevating: and the act of shaking;
or putting in motion, or into a state of commotion:
whence زَهَاهُ السَّرَابُ and زَهَتِ الرِّيحُ النَّبَاتَ [both
expl. in what follows]. (Har p. 171.) You say,
زَهَتِ الأَمْوَاجُ السَّفِينَةَ The waves raised the ship.
(TA.) And زَهَا السَّرَابُ الشَّىْءَ, aor. يَزْهَاهُ, The
mirage raised, or elevated, [to the eye,] the thing
[seen in it or beyond it; or rather, made it to
appear tall, and as though quivering, vibrating,
or playing up and down; as is perhaps meant to
be indicated by the citation above from Har];
syn. رَفَعَهُ; written only [thus] with ا [in the pret.
and in the aor.]: (S:) and السَّرَابُ يَزْهَى القُبُورَ
وَالحُمُولَ The mirage is as though it raised the
tombs and the women's camel-vehicles; or elevated
them; expl. by the words كَأَنَّهُ يَرْفَعُهَا. (TA.) ―
-b2-
And زَهَا المِرْوَحَةَ, said of a person fanning, He
put in motion the fan; or put it into a state of
commotion; as also ↓ زَهَّاهَا. (TA.) And زَهَتِ
الرِيحُ الشَّجَرَ, (S,) or النَّبَاتَ, (K, * TA,) aor. تَزْهَاهُ,
(S, TA,) inf. n. زَهْوٌ, (K, TA,) The wind shook,
or put in motion or into a state of commotion,
(S, K, * TA,) the trees, (S,) or the plants, or
herbage, after the dew or rain (غِبَّ النَّدَى). (K,
TA.) ―
-b3-  And زَهَاهُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. زَهْوٌ; (K, TA;)
and ↓ ازدهاهُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. اِزْدِهَآءٌ; (K, TA;)
[not ازهاهُ, as in the TK, followed by Freytag;]
i. q. اِسْتَخَفَّهُ: (S, K, * TA:) and تَهَاوَنَ بِهِ: (S:)
[the former of these two explanations as meaning
He, or it, incited him, or excited him, to briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness; or to lightness,
levity, or unsteadiness: and the latter of them,
or both of them, for the former is often syn. with
the latter, as meaning he held him, or it, in little,
or light, estimation or account, or in contempt;
he contemned, or despised, him, or it: but of this
latter meaning I do not remember to have met
with any ex.:] and بِهِ ↓ ازدهى signifies the same
as ازدهاه (TA) meaning تَهَاوَنَ بِهِ. (JK.) You
say, زَهَاهُ الشَّىْءُ and ↓ ازدهاهُ, meaning [agreeably
with the former of the two explanations in the
sentence immediately preceding] اِسْتَخَفَّهُ طَرَبًا:
(Har p. 359:) and ↓ يَزْدَهِينِى as meaning [agreeably with the same explanation] يَسْتَفِزُّنِى and
يَسْتَخِفُّنِى: (Id. p. 131:) and القَوْمَ ↓ ازدهى as
meaning [in like manner] اِسْتَخَفَّهُمْ مِنَ الطَّرَبِ;
and also as meaning He pleased the people, or
party: (Id. p. 427:) and ↓ اِزْدَهَاهُ also as meaning حَمَلَهُ عَلَى الزَّهْوِ [He incited him, or excited
him, to pride, or conceit, or the like]: (Id. p. 131:)
and زَهَاهُ الكِبْرُ (K) Pride rendered him self-conceited. (TK.) 'Omar Ibn-'Abee-Rabeea says,
وَلَمَّا تَقَاوَضْنَا الحَدِيثَ وَأَسْفَرَتْ
وُجُوهٌ زَهَاهَا الحُسْنُ أَنْ تَتَقَنَّعَا
meaning And when we discoursed together, and
faces shone, beauty excited the possessors of them
to levity (اِسْتَخَفَّ أَرْبَابَهَا) and prevented their veiling them with the قِنَاع [or head-covering], by
reason of self-admiration: or, as some say, the ها
in زهاها refers to a woman mentioned before, not
to وجوه; and the meaning is, beauty excited
her &c.: and thus the women of the Arabs used
to do when they were beautiful: or you may consider the complement of لَمَّا as suppressed; as
though he said, when we did all that, we behaved
with mutual familiarity, or the like; for the complements of لَوْ and لَمَّا and حِينَ may be suppressed, and their vagueness by reason of their
suppression is more forcible in respect of the
meaning: أَنْ تَتَقَنَّعَا means مِنْ أَنْ تَتَقَنَّعَا; for
they often suppress the preposition with أَنْ:
(Ham pp. 552-3:) [J gives two readings of this
verse, accord to one of my copies of the S: one
is with تَنَازَعَا in the place of تَقَاوَضْنَا, and أَشْرَقَتْ
in the place of أَسْفَرَتْ; which make no difference
in the meaning: but this is omitted in my other
copy: the other is as follows:]
فَلَمَّا تَوَافَقْنَا سَلَّمْتُ أَقْبَلَتْ
وُجُوهٌ زَهَاهَا الحُسْنُ أَنْ تَتَقَنَّعَا
[And when we agreed together, and I saluted,
faces advanced, which beauty excited &c, or the
possessors of which beauty excited &c.]. (S.)
And hence their saying, بِخَدِيعَةٍ ↓ فُلَانٌ لَا يُزْدَهَى
[Such a one will not be incited, or excited, to
briskness, &c., by means of deceit, or guile]. (S.)
And الفَرَحُ ↓ ازدهاهُ, meaning اِسْتَخَفَّهُ [Joy incited
him, &c.]. (MA.) [And hence, perhaps, may
be derived most of the following significations.]
―
-b4-  زَهَا الطَّلُّ النَوْرَ The طلّ [or fine drizzling rain]
made the flowers, or blossoms, to increase in
beauty of aspect. (TA.) ―
-b5-  زَهَا السِّرَاجَ, (K,) aor.
يزهوهُ [perhaps a mistranscription for يَزْهَاهُ], inf. n.
زَهْوٌ, (TA,) He made the سراج [or lamp, or lighted
wick,] to give a bright light. (K.) ―
-b6-  زَهَوْتُ الإِبِلَ
I made the camels to journey, after coming to
water, (A 'Obeyd, JK, S, K,) a night or more,
(A 'Obeyd, JK, S,) or a night or two nights. (K.)
Thus the verb in relation to camels is trans. as
well as intrans. (S.) ―
-b7-  زَهَا بِالسَّيْفُ He made a
sign with the sword by waving it, or brandishing
it. (K, TA.) ―
-b8-  زَهَا بِالعَصَا He struck with the
staff, or stick. (K.) ―
-b9-  زَهَا بِمِائَةِ رِطْلٍ He computed, or computed by conjecture, [to be of the
weight of] a hundred pounds. (K.) You say,
زَهَاهُ بِمِائَةِ رِطْلٍ meaning خرزه [a mistake for حَزَرَهُ
i. e. He computed it, &c., to be of the weight of
a hundred pounds]. (TK. In the TA, زها فلان
بمائة رطل, [الشَّىْءَ or the like being omitted by
an oversight,] aor. يَزْهَاهُ [which indicates an
omission after فلان].) And زَهَوْتُ القَوْمَ I computed, or computed by conjecture, the number of
the people, or party. (JK.)
-A3-  زُهِىَ, (JK, S, K,)
like عُنِىَ; (S, K;) and زَهَا, (IDrd, S, K,) like دَعَا,
but this is rare, (K,) and was dissallowed by As
in the sense of زُهِىَ, (TA in art. نخو,) aor. يَزْهُو,
inf. n. زَهْوٌ; (IDrd, S;) and ↓ أَزْهَى; (K;) said of a
man, (JK, S,) He behaved proudly, haughtily,
or insolently; (S, K, * TA;) he was proud, vain,
and boastful; (K;) or was pleased with himself,
or self-conceited: (JK:) ازدهى [i. e. ↓ اُزْدُهِىَ], in
like manner, means تَكَبَّرَ: (Har p. 264: [but this
more properly signifies, as shown above by an
explanation of اِزْدَهَاهُ, he was incited, or excited,
to lightness, levity, or unsteadiness:]) the first of
these verbs [may be originally pass. of زَهَا in the
phrase زَهَاهُ الكِبْرُ, mentioned before, but, as J says,]
is one of a class of verbs used in the pass. form
though having the sense of the act. form: in
using it imperatively, you say, لِتُزْهَ يَا رَجُلُ [Behave thou proudly, &c., O man; see art. ت];
and like this is the aor. [used as an imperative]
of every verb of which the agent is not named;
for when it is reduced to its essential import, you
thereby command something, other than the
person whom you address, to affect, or befall,
that person; and the third person of the [aor.
used as an] imperative is never without ل, as
when you say, لِيَقُمْ زَيْدٌ: (S, TA:) J also says,
(TA,) I said to an Arab of the desert, of [the
tribe of] Benoo-Suleym, What is the meaning of
زُهِىَ الرَّجُلُ? and he answered, The man was
pleased with himself, or self-conceited: I said,
Dost thou say, زَهَا as meaning اِفْتَخَرَ [He gloried,
or boasted, &c.]? and he answered, As for us, we
do not say it. (S, TA.) One says also, زُهِىَ فُلَانٌ
بِكَذَا i. e. نُخِىَ [Such a one gloried, or boasted,
and magnified himself, or behaved proudly, by
reason of such a thing]; as though meaning زَهَاهُ
الإِعْجَابُ بِنَفْسِهِ [i. e. self-conceit elevated him by
reason of such a thing]. (Har p. 171.) ―
-b2-  And
one says, زُهِىَ الشَّىْءُ بِعَيْنَيْكَ or لِعَيْنَيْكَ The thing
was beautiful in aspect in, or to, thine eyes. (S,
accord. to different copies. [The meaning is
there shown by what immediately precedes. In
three copies of the S, I find the verb in this
phrase thus written, زُهِىَ; and only in the PS,
زها, for زَهَا, which is the form given by Golius:
Freytag writes the phrase زَهَى الشى بعينك.])

زَهَّوَ see 1, in two places, in the former half of
the paragraph.
4
أَزْهَوَ see 1, in four places, in the first three
sentences: ―
-b2-  and again, in one place, in the
last quarter of the same paragraph.
-A2-  مَا أَزْهَاهُ
[meaning How proud, vain, boastful, or selfconceited, is he!] is from زَهَا as syn. with زُهِىَ;
not from the latter of these two verbs, because
the verb of wonder is not formed from a verb of
which the agent is not named. (S.)
8
اِزْدَهَى [originally اِزْتَهَى]: see 1, as a trans.
verb, in eight places. And اُزْدُهِىَ: see 1, in the
last quarter of the paragraph.
زَهْوٌ [is the inf. n. of زَهَا (q. v.): and also has
the significations here following. ―
-b2- ] Pride [as
implying self-elevation]: (JK, S, K:) vanity, or
vain behaviour: (K:) boasting, or glorying:
(S, K:) and wrongdoing, injustice, injuriousness,
or tyranny. (TA.) ―
-b3-  A false, or vain, saying;
syn. بَاطِلٌ; (S, K, and Ham p. 24;) a lie, or
falsehood; (JK, S, K, and Ham * ubi suprà;)
or an exaggeration in speech. (Ham ubi suprà.)
You say, قَالَ زَهْوًا [He said a false, or vain,
saying, &c.]. (Ham ubi suprà.) ―
-b4-  A beautiful
aspect. (S, K.) ―
-b5-  The blossoms, or flowers, of a
plant. (Lth, K.) ―
-b6-  The brightness of a plant
(K, TA) by its becoming red or yellow; (TA;)
as also ↓ زُهُوٌّ, (K, TA,) like عُلُوٌّ, (TA,) [in the
CK كالزَّهْوِ is here put in the place of كَالزُّهُوِّ,]
and ↓ زَهَآءٌ, (K, TA,) like سَحَابٌ, as the unrestricted mention of it requires, but in some of the
copies of the K with damm [i. e. زُهَآءٌ]. (TA.)
―
-b7-  Also, [or نَبَاتٌ زَهْوٌ, as in the TK,] A plant
beautiful and bright, (K,) or fresh. (TA.) ―
-b8-
And Dates beginning to ripen (بُسْرٌ) that are
becoming coloured (مُلَوِّنٌ), (so in some copies of
the S and K, and in the Mgh, or مُتَلَوِّنٌ [which
signifies the same], Har p. 416), or that have
become coloured (مُلَوَّنٌ); (so in other copies of
the S and K;) as also ↓ زُهُوٌّ, (K, TA,) like عُلُوٌّ,
thus in the handwriting of Az in the T: (TA:) [here,
again, in the CK we find كالزَّهْوِ put in the place
of كَالزُّهُوِّ: or perhaps it should be ↓ كَالزُّهْوِ; as
appears from what follows in the next sentence:]
in this sense, زَهْوٌ is an inf. n. used as a subst.
(Mgh.) One says, when redness and yellowness
appear in palm-trees, قَدْ ظَهَرَ فِيهِ الزَّهْوُ [Dates
becoming, or become, red, or yellow, have appeared in them; i. e. فِى النَّخْلِ]: and the people
of El-Hijáz say, ↓ الزُّهْوُ, with damm: (S:) [Fei
says,] the subst. from زَهَا النَّخْلُ meaning “ the
palm-trees showed redness and yellowness in
their fruit ” is الزهو [i. e. ↓ الزُّهْوُ], with damm;
and AHát says that this term is used only when
the colour of the date has become free from admixture in redness or yellowness. (Msb.) ―
-b9-  You
say also ثَوْبٌ زَهْوٌ A red and beautiful garment or
piece of cloth: and ثِيَابٌ زَهْوَةٌ and ↓ زَاهِيَةٌ [red
and beautiful garments &c.]. (JK.)
زُهْوٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, latter
half, in three places.
زُهَا الدُّنْيَا The ornature, finery, show, pomp, or
gaiety, of the present life or world. (K, TA.)
The former noun [when indeterminate] is [with
tenween, زُهًا,] like هُدًى. (K.)
زَهْوَةٌ A shining, glistening, or brilliancy; whatever be the colour. (TA.)
زَهَآءٌ: see زَهْوٌ, in the former half of the paragraph.
زُهَآءٌ Number, or amount. (JK, Msb.) You
say, كَمْ زُهَاؤُهُمْ How many is their number? or
how much is their amount? (Msb, TA:) or, the
computation of them? (TA.) And هُمْ زُهَآءُ مِائَةٍ
[They are as many as a hundred;] they are the
number, or amount, of a hundred; (El-Fárábee,
S, Mgh, Msb, K; *) or their number, or amount,
is a hundred: (Mgh:) and مِائَةٍ ↓ زِهَآءُ, also, with
kesr: (El-Fárábee, Msb:) but the saying of
the [common] people هُمْ زُهَآء عَلَى مِائَة is not
[correct] Arabic. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  Also A large number: whence in a trad. respecting the time of the
resurrection, إِذَا سَمِعْتُمْ بِنَاسٍ مِنْ قِبَلِ المَشْرِقِ
أُولِى زُهَآءٍ i. e. [When ye hear of men coming
from the direction of the east,] having a large
number. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And زُهَآءُ الشَّىْءِ signifies The
شَخْص [i. e. corporeal form or figure or substance,
which one sees from a distance,] of the thing.
(TA.)
زِهَآءُ مِائَةٍ: see the next preceding paragraph.
زُهُوٌّ: see زَهْوٌ, in two places. ―
-b2-  Also The redness of colour, and beauty, of garments or cloths.
(JK.)
زَاهٍ [act. part. n. of زَهَا]. ―
-b2-  إِبِلٌ زَاهِيَةٌ Camels
that will not pasture upon the [plants, or trees,
termed] حَمْضِ: (ISk, S:) pl. زَوَاهٍ. (TA.) ―
-b3-
زَاهِى اللَّوْن Bright in respect of colour. (TA.)
ثِيَابٌ زَاهِيَةٌ: see زَهْوٌ, last sentence.
أَزْهَى [meaning More, and most, proud, vain,
boastful, or self-conceited, is, like مَا أَزْهَاهُ (q. v.),
from زَهَا as syn. with زُهِىَ; not from the latter of
these two verbs]. You say أَزْهَى مِنْ غُرَابٍ [More
proud, &c., than a crow]; (S, Meyd;) because
the crow, in walking, ceases not to go with a
proud, or self-conceited, gait, and to look at
itself: and مِنْ وَعِلٍ [than a mountain-goat]: and
من طَاؤُوسٍ [than a peacock]: and دِيكٍ and ذُبَابٍ
and ثَوْرٍ and ثَعْلَبٍ [a cock and a fly and a bull
and a fox]: all these are provs. (Meyd.)
إِنْزَهْوٌ, in which each of the first two letters is
augmentative, and which is said to be the only
word of its kind except إِنْقَحْلٌ from قَحَلَ, (MF,
TA,) applied to a man, Proud, haughty, or
insolent; (Lh, K;) as also ↓ مُزْدَهًى [which more
properly means incited, or excited, to lightness,
levity, or unsteadiness]; (Har p. 264:) pl. of the
former إِنْزَهْوُونَ. (Lh, TA.) [See also what next
follows.]
مَزْهُوٌّ, from زُهِى, applied to a man, Proud,
haughty, or insolent; (S, TA;) [vain, and boast-
ful;] pleased with himself, or self-conceited.
(TA.) [See also what next precedes.]
مُزْدَهًى: see إِنْزَهْوٌ, above.
