زبر1
زَبَرَ البِئْرَ, (A, TA,) [aor.
زَبُرَ, and perhaps
زَبِرَ
also,] inf. n. زَبْرٌ, (S, K,) He cased the well, or
walled it internally, with stones. (S, A, K.) ―
-b2-
زَبْرٌ also signifies The disposing a building, or
construction, one part upon another; (K;) [as is
done in casing a well;] and in this sense likewise
it is an inf. n., of which the verb is زَبَرَ. (TK.)
―
-b3-  And زَبَرَهُ بِالحِجَارَةِ, (TA,) inf. n. زَبْرٌ, (K,) He
threw stones at him; or pelted him with stones.
(K, TA.) ―
-b4-  And [hence, perhaps, or] from زَبَرَ
in the first of the senses expl. above, because him
whom you restrain from error you strengthen like
as a well is strengthened by its being cased, (TA,)
زَبَرَهُ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
زَبُرَ (S, Mgh, Msb,
K) and
زَبِرَ, (Ks, K,) inf. n. as above, (S, Mgh,
Msb, K,) He chid him; or checked, restrained,
or forbade, him with rough speech: (S, A, Mgh,
Msb, K:) he prevented, hindered, or withheld,
him: (S, Mgh, K:) he forbade, or prohibited,
him: (K:) he repelled him with strength. (MF
in art. هزبر.) You say, زَبَرَهُ عَنِ الأَمْرِ He restrained him with rough speech, or forbade and
prevented him, from doing the thing. (TA.)
And زَبَرَ السَّائِلَ He chid and repelled the beggar
with rough speech. (TA.)
-A2-  زَبَرَ, (S, A, Msb, K,)
aor.
زَبُرَ and
زَبِرَ, (S, K,) inf. n. as above, He wrote
(S, A, Msb, K) a writing, or book: (A, Msb:)
or he wrote it firmly, skilfully, or well: (TA:)
and he inscribed, or engraved, upon stones: (Az,
TA:) and ↓ تَزْبِرَةٌ, also, is syn. with كِتَابَةٌ, like
زَبْرٌ, (S, K,) and خَطٌّ: As says, I heard an Arab
of the desert say, أَنَا أَعْرِفُ تَزْبِرَتِى, meaning
خَطِّى and كِتَابَتِى [i. e. I know my writing, or
handwriting]: (S:) and Fr says, It is either an
inf. n. of ↓ زَبَّرَ, meaning he wrote, though I know
not the verb with teshdeed, or it is a simple subst.
like تَوْدِيَةٌ: (TA:) thus زَبَرَ is syn. with ذَبَرَ:
(A 'Obeyd, T and S in art. ذبر:) [and so, perhaps,
is ↓ زَبَّرَ with ذَبَّرَ.] ―
-b2-  And زَبَرْتُهُ signifies also I
read it, or recited it; [or did so with a low, or
faint, voice;] like ذَبَرْتُهُ [q. v.]. (As, TA.) ―
-b3-
زَبْرٌ is also syn. with كَلَامٌ [as meaning The act of
speaking, or speech as a subst.]: (K:) [SM says,]
thus it is found in all the copies: but [he adds] I have
not found any authoritative ex. of it, so it requires
consideration. (TA.) [Accord. to the TK, however, one says, سَأَلْتُهُ فَمَا زَبَرَ لِى بِزَبْرٍ, meaning I
asked him, and he spoke not to me a speech, or
sentence]
-A3-  Accord. to the K, زَبْرٌ is also syn.
with صَبْرٌ [meaning The being patient, or patience]:
one says, مَا لَهُ زَبْرٌ وَلَاصَبْرٌ: ISd says, This is mentioned by IAar; but in my opinion, the meaning
here is عَقْلٌ. (TA. [See زَبْرٌ below.]) [Or, as
syn. with صَبْرٌ, it may be an inf. n.: for, accord. to
the TK, one says, لم يزبر عليه, meaning He did
not endure it with patience (لَمْ يَصْبِرْ).]
-A4-  زَبُرَ,
inf. n. زَبَارَةٌ, He (a ram) was, or became, bulky.
(Lth, TA.)
2
زَبَّرَ see 1, in two places.
4
ازبر He (a man, TA) was, or became, large
in body. (K.) ―
-b2-  And He was, or became,
courageous, brave, or strong-hearted. (K.)
-A2-
أَزْبَرْتُهُ, inf. n. إِزْبَارٌ, I rendered him (a ram) bulky.
(Lth, TA.)
5
تزبّر He (a man) quaked, or trembled, by
reason of anger. (TA. [See also Q. Q. 4.])
Q. Q. 1
زَأْبَرَ (S, A, K) and زَوْبَرَ (K) [and app.
زَيْبَرَ (see مُزَأْبِرٌ)], said of a garment, or piece of
cloth, (S, A, K,) Its زِئْبِر [or nap] came forth;
(S, K; *) it had زِئْبِر. (TA.)
-A2-  Also the first,
[and app. the second and third likewise,] He
made a garment, or piece of cloth, to have its زِئْبِر
[or nap] come forth. (K.) [This verb and
other similar words with hemzeh next after the ز
are mentioned in the K in a separate art. before
art. زبر.]
Q. Q. 4
اِزْبَأَرَّ It (fur, or soft hair, and a plant,
or herbage) grew forth. (S, K, TA.) ―
-b2-  It (hair)
bristled up. (S, A, K.) ―
-b3-  He (a dog [and a
horse]) bristled up his hair. (S, K.) Marrár
Ibn-Munkid El-Handhalee says, (S, TA,) describing a horse, (TA,)
فَهْوَ وَرْدُ اللَّوْنِ فِى ازْبِئْرَارِهِ
وَكُمَيْتُ اللَّوْنِ مَا لَمْ يَزْبَئِرْ
[And he is of a yellowish red colour on the occasion of his bristling up his hair, and of a dark
bay colour as long as he does not bristle up his
hair]. (S, TA.) ―
-b4-  Also He (a cat) had abundance of hair. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And He (a man) prepared for evil, or mischief: (K, TA:) or became
affected by a quaking, or trembling, and a bristling-up of the hair. (TA)
زَبْرٌ Stones. (K.) ―
-b2-  [The stone casing of the
interior of a well: see جُولٌ. ―
-b3-  And hence,]
(tropical:)  Understanding, intellect, or intelligence, (S, A,
K,) and judgment, (TA,) and self-restraint: (S,
A:) originally an inf. n. [accord. to some; but
this is evidently a mistake, as is shown by phrases
in which it is coupled with جُولٌ]. (S.) One
says, مَا لَهُ زَبْرٌ (tropical:)  He has not understanding, or intellect, or intelligence, nor self-restraint: (S, A:)
or judgment: or understanding to be relied upon.
(TA.) And لَهُ زَبْرٌ وَجُولٌ: and مَا فَوْقَ ↓ هُوَ مَزْبُورٌ
الجُولِ مِنْهُ وَصُلْبٌ مَا تَحْتَ الزَّبْرِ مِنَ الجُولِ: see
جُولٌ. One says also of the wind, when it veers,
or shifts, and does not continue to blow from one
point, لَيْسَ لَهَا زَبْرٌ (tropical:)  [It has not steadiness]. (TA.)
-A2-  See also زِبِرٌّ.
زِبْرٌ [A thing] written; as also ↓ زَبِيرٌ: (K:)
[or] a writing, or book; (S;) as also ↓ زَبُورٌ, of
the measure فَعُولٌ in the sense of the measure
مَفْعُولٌ, (S, Msb, K,) like رَسُولٌ: (Msb, TA:)
زَبُورٌ signifying any writing or book: or any
divine book with which it is difficult to become
acquainted: or a book that is confined to intel-lectual science, exclusive of legal statutes or ordinances: (TA:) ↓ الزَّبُورُ signifies particularly the
Book [of the Psalms] of David: (S, Mgh, Msb,
K:) and also, and لُغَةُ الزَّبُورِ, the Syriac [or
Hebrew] language: (Mgh:) the pl. of زِبْرٌ is زُبُورٌ;
(S, K;) and the pl. of ↓ زَبُورٌ is زُبُرٌ. (S, Msb, K.)
It is said in the Kur [xxi. 105], وَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِى
مِنْ بَعْدِ الذِّكْرِ ↓ الزَّبُورِ, meaning And we have
written in the book sent down to David, after
the تَوْرَاة [or Book of the Law revealed to Moses]:
(Aboo-Hureyreh, TA:) Sa'eed Ibn-Jubeyr read
الزُّبُور, [pl. of الزِّبْرُ,] and said that it means the
Book of the Law revealed to Moses (التوراة) and
the Gospel and the Kur-án [together]; and that
الذكر means what is in heaven: (TA:) and
some also read زُبُورًا in the Kur iv. 161 and
xvii. 57. (S, TA.)
زَبَرٌ, syn. with زَوْبَرٌ &c.: see زِئْبِرٌ.
زُبْرَةٌ A piece of iron: (S, Msb, K:) or a big
piece of iron: (TA:) pl. زُبَرٌ (S, Msb, K) and زُبُرٌ.
(S, K.) The former pl. occurs in the Kur xviii.
95. (S.) It is also said in the Kur [xxiii. 55],
فَتَقَطَّعُوا أَمْرَهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ زُبُرًا, (S, TA,) and زُبَرًا;
(TA;) meaning قِطَعًا, (S, TA,) in both cases;
(Fr;) [i.e., But they have become divided, in
their state, among themselves, into parties:] or
he who reads زُبُرًا makes it pl. of ↓ زَبُورٌ, not of
زُبْرَةٌ; for the measure فُعْلَةٌ does not assume the
measure فُعُلٌ in the pl.; and the meaning is, they
have made their religion [to be founded upon]
various books: and زُبَرٌ is pl. of زُبْرَةٌ: or it may be
also pl. of ↓ زَبُورٌ, and originally زُبُرٌ, being changed
therefrom, like as some of the Arabs are related to
have said جُدَدٌ for the pl. of جَدِيدٌ, which is
originally and regularly جُدُدٌ; after the same
manner as when one says رُكَبَاتٌ for رُكُبَاتٌ, and
غُرَفَاتٌ for غُرُفَاتٌ: and this opinion is strengthened
by AA's allowing the reading زُبُرًا and زُبْرًا and
زُبَرًا; زُبْرًا being a contraction of زُبُرًا, like as عُنْقٌ is
of عُنُقٌ. (IB, TA.) ―
-b2-  The anvil (K) of a blacksmith. (TA.)
-A2-  The upper part of the back,
next the neck; or the part between the two
shoulder-blades; or the part where the neck is
joined to the back-bone; syn. كَاهِلٌ: (K:) or
the place of the كاهل: (S:) or a certain thing
rising from the كاهل: (TA:) pl. in this sense,
أَزْبَارٌ; or this is a pl. pl., as though it were pl.
of زُبَرٌ, and this were pl. of زُبْرَةٌ in this sense.
(TA.) One says, شَدَّ لِلْأَمْرِ زُبْرَتَهُ He strengthened
his كَاهِل and his back for the affair. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Also, hence, (S,) The accumulation, or mass, of
hair which is between the shoulder-blades of the
lion; (S in art. لبد;) [the mane of a lion;] the
collection of hair (Lth, A, K) between the shoulderblades of the lion &c., (K,) or upon the place of
the كَاهِل [expl. above], and upon the elbows, of
the lion; (Lth, A;) and any hair in a similar
collected state. (Lth, TA.) ―
-b3-  And [hence,] الزُّبْرَةُ
(tropical:)  A certain asterism; (K;) two bright stars [d
and q], (S, K,) in the كَاهِل [or part of the back
next the neck], (K,) or which are the كَاهِلَانِ,
(S,) of Leo; (S, K;) one [namely the Eleventh]
of the Mansions of the Moon: (S, K:) [also
called الخَرَاتَانِ: see this word: and see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ,
in art. نزل:] it is of the dial. of El-Yemen. (TA.)
[This description is incorrect if applied to the
constellation as at present figured; but doubtless
correct when applied to it as figured by the Arabs.
Kzw, in his description of Leo, says that they are
two stars, on the belly, and on the projecting part
of the haunch-bone, of Leo.] ―
-b4-  Also The breast,
or what projects of its upper part, (syn. صُدْرَةٌ,)
of any beast. (TA.)
زِبِرٌّ, applied to a lion, (S, TA,) and to a man,
(TA,) Strong; (AA, S, K, TA;) as also ↓ زَبْرٌ.
(K.)
زَبُورٌ: see زِبْرٌ, in four places; and see زُبْرَةٌ, in
two places.
زَبِيرٌ: see زِبْرٌ.
-A2-  Applied to a ram, Bulky:
(Lth, TA:) or large in the زُبْرَة [q. v.]: or compact. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Applied to a man, Strong: and
also acute, sharp, or quick, in intellect; clever,
ingenious, skilful, knowing, or intelligent. (TA.)
-A3-  Also A calamity, or misfortune; (Fr, K;)
and so ↓, زَوْبَرٌ, (Mohammad Ibn-Habeeb, TA,)
which has been said to have this meaning in a
verse of Ibn-Ahmar cited below voce زِئْبِرٌ. (TA.)
-A4-  And Black mud; or black fetid mud. (Sgh,
K.)
زَأْبَرٌ: see the next paragraph.
زُؤْبُرٌ: see the next paragraph.
زِئْبِرٌ (S, and K in art. زأبر, in the CK [erroneously] written زِئْبَر,) and زِئْبُرٌ, (S, K,) sometimes
thus pronounced, (S,) or this, which is mentioned
by IJ and ISd, is incorrect, (K, * TA,) and ↓ زُؤْبُرٌ
and ↓ زُوبُرٌ and ↓ زَوْبَرٌ, (K in arts. زأبر and زبر,)
as also زَغْبَرٌ or زِغْبَرٌ (as in two different copies of
the K in art. زغبر) or زِغْبِرٌ (as in another copy of
the K and in the O and TA in the same art.)
and زَغْبُرٌ (accord. to a copy of the K in that art.)
or زِغْبُرٌ, (O and TA in that art., and so accord. to
one copy of the K,) [The nap, or villous substance, upon the surface of a garment, or piece of
cloth;] what is upon the surface of a new garment, or piece of cloth, like what is upon the
surface of [the kind of cloth called] خَزّ; (S, TA;)
the زِئْبِر of [the kind of cloth called] خَزّ, and of a
قَطِيفَة, and of any garment, or piece of cloth;
(Lth, TA;) the زغبر of a garment, or piece of
cloth; (AZ, TA;) or what appears of the دَرْز
[q. v., here meaning nap, or villous substance,]
of a garment, or piece of cloth. (IJ, K.) [Hence]
one says, ذَهَبَتِ الأَيَّامُ بِطَرَاوَتِهِ وَنَفَضَتْ زِئْبِرَهُ (tropical:)  [lit.
Days took away its freshness, and shook off its
nap]; meaning its age became old. (A, TA.)
And ↓ أَخَذَهُ بِزَوْبَرِهِ (S, A, K) and ↓ زَأْبَرِهِ (S, K)
and ↓ زَبَرِهِ, (K,) as also زَغْبَرِهِ, (S, and K * in art.
زغبر,) and ↓ زَنَوْبَرِهِ, incorrectly written in the K
زَبَوْبَرِهِ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He took it altogether, (S, A, K,)
leaving nothing of it. (S.) Ibn-Ahmar says,
وَإِنْ قَالَ عَاوٍ مِنْ مَعَدٍّ قَصِيدَةً
بِهَا جَرَبٌ عُدَّتْ عَلَىَّ بِزَوْبَرَا
i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [And if a howler of Ma'add utters an ode
in which is a fault,] it is attributed to me altogether, (S, * L,) when I have not been the
author of it: (L:) the last word, accord. to
Aboo-'Alee [El-Fárisee], being imperfectly decl.
because made a proper name for the قصيدة, and
therefore combining the two qualities of being
determinate and being of the fem. gender: so he
said in answer to a question of IJ: but some say
that the said word there means a calamity, or
misfortune: and IB says that it is a proper name
for a bitch (كلبة [if this be not a mistranscription]), of the fem. gender. (TA. [In one copy
of the S, I find only the last three words of this
verse: in another, it commences thus: إِذَا قَالَ
غَاوٍ مِنْ تَنُوخَ: in the TA, the former reading is
given, except that غَاوٍ is put in the place of عَاوٍ.])
One says also, ↓ رَجَعَ بِزَوْبَرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He returned disappointed, or unsuccessful; (TA;) without having
obtained anything; (K, TA;) and without having
accomplished his want. (TA.)

أَزْبَرُ and ↓ مَزْبَرَانِىٌّ (the latter written in [some
of] the copies of the K, [not in all of them, for
in the CK it is written as above,] مُزْبِرٌ, which is
a mistake, TA) Large in the زُبْرَة [q. v.]: (S, K:)
the former applied to a man, and the latter to a
lion: (S:) or, accord. to ISd, Khálid Ibn-Kulthoom is in error in saying that the latter is an
epithet applied to the lion; and that the correct
word is مَرْزُبَانِىٌّ: the fem. of the former is زَبْرَآءُ.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Also the former, Annoying, or hurting.
(Sgh, K.) ―
-b3-  قَدْ هَاجَتْ زَبْرَآءُ [Zebrà has become
excited], (S,) or هَاجَتْ زَبْرَآؤُهُ His anger has
become excited, is said of any man when this has
been the case: (TA:) [it is said that] Zebrà was
a clamorous and foul-tongued slave-girl of ElAhnaf Ibn-Keys; and when she was angry, he
used to say, قد هاجت زبرآء: and it became a
proverb. (S, TA.)

second, (Sgh, TA,) A garment, or piece of cloth,
having nap (زِئْبِر) upon it: (S, K:) [or the
second and fifth and sixth, having its nap made
to come forth:] or the first is applied to a man
[as meaning making to have its nap come forth;

fifth and sixth]. (TA.)
