زرجنQ. 1
زَرْجَنَةٌ (as an inf. n. TK) i. q. تَخَارُجٌ
[q. v.]: (K) one says, زَرْجَنُوا, meaning تَخَارَجُوا.
(TK.) ―
-b2-  And The being deceitful, wicked, dishonest, or dissimulating, and mischief-making; or
very deceitful &c.: and the act of deceiving, deluding, beguiling, circumventing, or outwitting:
(K:) one says, زَرْجَنَهُ, meaning He deceived him,
deluded him, &c. (TK.)
زَرَجُونٌ, (S, K,) which is also written زُرْجُونٌ,
like عُصْفُورٌ, is mentioned in art. زرج and also in
the present art. by the author of the K, though
he charges J with error in mentioning it in this
art. because مُزَرَّجٌ is used by a rájiz as meaning
“ intoxicated: ” whereas J is not in error, but is
right, in doing thus; for the ن is radical accord.
to the generality of the lexicologists and the
authors on inflection, like the س in قَرَبُوسٌ; and
the rájiz above referred to elided the ن in forming
مُزَرَّجٌ because he imagined it to be augmentative:
(MF in art. زرج:) it signifies Wine; (S, K;)
and is a Pers. word, (As, Sh, Seer, S,) originally
زركون, [i. e. زَرْگُونْ,] (Sh, TA,) meaning “ goldcoloured: ” (As, Sh, Seer, S:) or it signifies, (S,
Mgh,) or signifies also [like as does عِنَبٌ, of
which the primary signification is “ grapes ”],
(K,) the grape-vine; (ISh, S, Mgh, K;) n. un.
with ة; (ISh, TA;) and pl. زَرَاجِينُ: (Mgh:) it
has this meaning in the dial. of Et-Táïf: (ISh,
TA in art. زرج:) or the shoots of a grape-vine:
(Mgh, K:) thus in the dial. of Et-Táïf and ElGhowr: (TA in the present art.:) or a shoot that
is planted, of a grape-vine. (AHn, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also
A certain red dye. (El-Jarmee, S, K.) ―
-b3-  And
Water that remains or stagnates, or collects, or
remains long and becomes altered, or becomes
yellow and altered, in a rock: (K in art. زرج:)
or clear water that remains or stagnates, &c., in
a mountain. (MF, TA.)
