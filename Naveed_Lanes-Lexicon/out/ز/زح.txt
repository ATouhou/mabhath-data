it, from his, or its, place: (S, L, K:) and he
pushed, or thrust, away, him, or it: (L, K:) or
the latter, he removed him, or it, far away;
placed, or put, him, or it, at a distance, far away,
or far off: (S, A, Mgh, L, Msb:) and the former
signifies also he drew, dragged, or pulled, away,

عَنْهُ He removed him, or it, far away; (S, K;)
or pushed, or thrust, away; and removed; him,
or it; (TA;) from it; (S, K;) i. e. from his, or
its, place. (TA.) It is said in the Kur [iii. 182],
عَنِ النَّارِ وَأُدْخِلَ الجَنَّةَ فَقَدْ فَازَ ↓ فَمَنْ زُحْزِحَ, i. e.
[And he] who shall be removed [from the fire

R. Q. 1
زَحْزَحَ: see above, in three places:
-A2-
and see also the paragraph here following.
R. Q. 2
تَزَحْزَحَ He, or it, removed, or became
removed; (S, A, Mgh, Msb;) and (Mgh, Msb)
removed, or became removed, far away: (Mgh,
Msb, K:) and accord. to Es-Semeen, ↓ زَحْزَحَ is
likewise used in an intrans. sense, as well as a
trans.; but MF says that its use in an intrans.
sense is strange. (TA.) You say, دَخَلْتُ عَلَى
فُلَانٍ فَتَزَحْزَحَ لِى عَنْ مَجْلِسِهِ, i. e. [I went in to
such a one, and] he removed [for me from his
sitting-place]. (Mgh, Msb. *)
زَحْزَحٌ Distance: so in the saying, هُوَ بِزَحْزَحٍ مِنْهُ
[He, or it, is at a distance from him, or it].
(S, K.) Az says that, accord. to some, this is a
reduplicative word from زَاحَ, aor. يَزِيحُ, meaning
تَأَخَّرَ; and some hold it to be from الزَّوْحُ meaning
“ the driving vehemently,” as also الذَّوْحُ. (TA.)
زَحْزَاحٌ Distant; remote. (K.)
مُتَزَحْزَحٌ A place to which one removes, or may
remove, [in an absolute sense, as is implied in the
A, or] far away. (Ham p. 655.) One says, مَالِى
عَنْهُ مُتَزَحْزَحٌ [There is not for me any place to
which to remove from him, or it]. (A.)
