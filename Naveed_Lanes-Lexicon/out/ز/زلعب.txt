زلعبQ. 4
اِزْلَعَبَّ, (K,) inf. n. اِزْلِعْبَابٌ, (S in art.
زعب,) said of a torrent, It was, or became,
copious, and impelled in its several parts, or
portions, by the impetus of one part, or portion,
acting upon another. (S, K.) Accord. to the S,
and AHei, the ل is augmentative; [as it is said
with equal reason to be in اِزْلَغَبَّ;] but accord. to
the K, it is radical, and therefore this is its
proper place, not art. زعب. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also i. q.
اِزْلَغَبَّ, [q. v.,] said of hair. (TA in art. زلغب.) ―
-b3-
And ازلعبّ السَّحَابُ The clouds were, or became,
dense, or thick. (K.)
مُزْلَعِبٌّ A torrent that is copious, and impelled
in its several parts, or portions, by the impetus of
one part, or portion, acting upon another, (S in
art. زعب, and K, and TA,) having much rubbish
or many small particles or fragments [borne on
its surface]. (TA.) [See also زَاعِبٌ.] ―
-b2-  Also a
dial. var. of مُزْلَغِبٌّ, [q. v.,] applied to a young
bird. (TA.)
