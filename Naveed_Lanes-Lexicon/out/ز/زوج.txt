زوج2
زوّج شَيْئًا بِشَىْءٍ, and زوّجهُ إِلَيْهِ, [inf. n. تَزْوِيجٌ,]
He coupled, or paired, a thing with a thing;
united it to it as its fellow, or like. (TA.) So in
the Kur [xliv. 54 and lii. 20], زَوَّجْنَاهُمْ بِحُورٍ عِينٍ
We will couple them, or pair them, [with females
having eyes like those of gazelles:] (S, Mgh, K,
TA:) the meaning is not the تَزْوِيج commonly
known, [i. e. marriage,] for there will be no
[such] تزويج in Paradise. (MF, TA.) And so
in the Kur [lxxxi. 7], وَإِذَا النُّفُوسُ زُوِّجَتْ And
when the souls shall be coupled, or paired, or
united with their fellows: (TA:) i. e., with their
bodies: (Bd, Jel:) or, each with its register:
(Bd:) or with its works: (Bd, TA:) or the souls
of the believers with the حُور, and those of the
unbelievers with the devils: (Bd:) or when each
sect, or party, shall be united with those whom
it has followed. (TA.) And so in the phrase,
زَوَّجْتُ إِبِلِى I coupled, or paired, my camels, one
with another: (A:) or زَوَّجْتُ بَيْنَ الإِبِلِ I coupled,
or paired, every one of the camels with another.
(TA.) So too in the Kur [xlii. 49], أَوْ يُزَوِّجُهُمْ
ذُكْرَانًا وَإِنَاثًا Or He maketh them couples, or
pairs, males and females: or, accord. to AM,
maketh them of different sorts [or sexes], males
and females: for ―
-b2-  تَزْوِيجٌ signifies [also] The
making to be of different sorts or species [&c.].
(TA.) ―
-b3-  زَوَّجْتُهُ امْرَأَةً, (T, S, A, * Mgh, Msb, K,)
thus the Arabs say accord. to Yoo (S, Mgh) and
ISK, (Mgh,) making the verb doubly trans. by
itself, [without a particle,] meaning I married
him, or gave him in marriage, to a woman;
(Msb, TA;) as also بِامْرَأَةٍ; (A, K;) Akh says
that this is allowable [app. as being of the dial.
of Azd-Shanooäh (see 5)]: (Msb, TA:) [when
the verb is trans. by means of بِ, it generally
has the meaning expl. in the first sentence of this
art.:] زَوَّجْتُ مِنْهُ امْرَأَةً is not of the language of
the Arabs: (T, Mgh, TA:) [but see a similar
phrase in a verse cited in art. حصن, conj. 4:] the
lawyers say, زَوَّجْتُهُ مِنْهَا [meaning I married him
to her]; but this is a phrase for which there is no
reasonable way of accounting, unless that it is
accord. to the opinion of those who hold that مِنْ
may be redundant in an affirmative proposition, or
that of those who hold that it may be substituted
for بِ. (Msb.)
3
زاوجهُ, [inf. n. مُزَاوَجَةٌ and زِوَاجٌ] It, or he,
was, or became, a couple, or pair, with it, or
him: or made a coupling, or pairing, with it, or
him. (MA.) [And زَاوَجَا They two formed
together a couple, or pair.] ―
-b2-  [And زاوجا, inf. n.
as above, They married each other.] You say,
هُذَيْلٌ يُزَاوِجُ عِكْرِمَةَ [The tribe of Hudheyl intermarry with that of 'Ikrimeh]. (A. [See also 6.])
―
-b3-  زاوج بَيْنَهُمَا and ↓ ازوج (tropical:)  [He made them two
(referring to sentences or phrases) to have a
mutual resemblance in their prose-rhymes, or in
measure: or to be connected, each with the other;
or dependent, each on the other]. (A, TA.) See
also 8, in three places.

أَزْوَجَ see the next preceding paragraph.
5
تَزَوَّجْتُ امْرَأَةً, (T, S, A, * Mgh, Msb, K,)
thus the Arabs say accord. to Yoo (S, Mgh) and
ISK, (Mgh,) meaning I married a woman; i. e.,
took a woman in marriage; took her as my wife;
(Msb, TA;) as also بِامْرَأَةٍ; (A, * K;) or this is
rare; (K;) Akh says that it is allowable; (Msb,
TA;) and it is said to be of the dial. of AzdShanooäh, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) by Fr; (S, TA;)
but accord. to Yoo (S, Mgh) and ISK, (Mgh,)
it is not of the language of the Arabs. (T, S,
Mgh.) And تزوّج فِى بَنِى فُلَانٍ (A, Msb, TA)
He married, or took a wife, among the sons of
such a one. (Msb, TA.) And تزوّج إِلَيْهِ i. q. خَاتَنَهُ
[He allied himself to him by marriage]. (K in
art. ختن.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] تزوّجهُ النَّوْمُ (assumed tropical:)  Sleep pervaded him; syn. خَالَطَهُ. (K.)
6
تزاوج القَوْمُ and ↓ اِزْدَوَجُوا The people, or
party, married one another; intermarried. (TA.
[See also 3.]) ―
-b2-  See also the next paragraph, in
three places.
8
اِزْدَوَجَتِ الطَّيْرُ [The birds coupled, or paired,
one with another]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also 6. ―
-b3-
اِزْدَوَجَا and ↓ تَزَاوَجَا [and ↓ زَاوَجَا], said of two
phrases, or sentences, (A, TA,) (tropical:)  They bore a
mutual resemblance in their prose-rhymes, or in
measure: or were connected, each with the other;
or dependent, each on the other: and in like
manner, ازدوج and ↓ تزاوج, said of a phrase, or
sentence, (tropical:)  It was such that one part of it resembled another in the prose-rhyme, or in the
measure: or consisted of two propositions connected, each with the other; or dependent, each on
the other: (TA:) اِزْدِوَاجٌ and ↓ مُزَاوَجَةٌ (S, A, K)
and ↓ تَزَاوُجٌ (S) are syn.: (S, A, * K:) ازدواج signifies A conformity, or mutual resemblance, [with
respect to sound, or measure,] of two words occurring near together; as in the phrase مِنْ سَبَأٍ بِنَبَأٍ
[in the Kur xxvii. 22]: (Kull p. 31:) and this
is also termed ↓ مُزَاوَجَةٌ and مُحَاذَاةٌ and مُوَازَنَةٌ
and مُقَابَلَةٌ and مُؤَازَاةٌ. (Marginal note in a copy
of the Muzhir, 22nd نوع.)
زَاجٌ [Vitriol;] a well-known kind of salt; (K,
TA;) called شَبٌّ يَمَانِىٌّ; [but see شَبٌّ;] which is
a medicinal substance, and one of the ingredients
of ink: (Lth, TA:) [pl. زَاجَاتٌ, meaning species,
or sorts, of vitriol; namely, green, or sulphate of
iron, which is an ingredient in ink, and is generally meant by the term زاج when unrestricted by
an epithet; blue, or sulphate of copper; and
white, or sulphate of zinc:] it is a Pers. word,
(S,) arabicized, (S, K,) originally زاگ. (TA.)
زَوْجٌ primarily signifies A sort of thing of any
kind [that is one of a pair or couple]: and زَوْجَانِ
signifies a pair, or couple, i. e. any two things
paired or coupled together, whether they be likes
or contraries: زَوْجٌ signifying either one of such
two things: (Az, TA:) or, accord. to 'Alee Ibn-
'Eesà, a sort of thing [absolutely]: (Mgh:) or a
sort of thing having its like, (El-Ghooree, Mgh,
Msb,) as in the case of species; (Msb;) or having
its contrary, (El-Ghooree, Mgh, Msb,) as the
moist and the dry, and the male and the female,
and the night and the day, and the bitter and the
sweet; (Msb;) though sometimes applied to any
sort of thing; and to a single thing: (El-Ghooree,
Mgh:) or it is applied to a single thing only
when having with it a thing of the same kind;
(Mgh, Msb;) زَوْجَانِ signifying a pair, or couple,
of such things: (Mgh:) the pl. is أَزْوَاجِ: (TA:)
you say زَوْجَانِ مِنْ حَمَامٍ and زَوْجَا حَمَامٍ [A pair
of pigeons]: (A:) and اِشْتَرَيْتُ زَوْجَى حَمَامٍ [I
bought a pair of pigeons], meaning a male and a
female: (S:) and زَوْجَا نِعَالٍ [A pair of sandals]:
(S, A:) and in like manner زَوْجَيْنِ is used in the
Kur xi. 42 and xxiii. 28; (S;) meaning a male
and a female: (Bd, Jel:) or, accord. to the M,
زَوْجٌ signifies one of a pair or couple: and also
a pair or couple together: (TA:) and in like
manner says AO, (Mgh, Msb,) and IKt, and
IF: (Msb:) and ISh says that it signifies two;
(Mgh;) and so says IDrd: (Msb:) so that you
say, هُمَا زَوْجٌ as well as هُمَا زَوْجَانِ [meaning They
two are a pair, or couple]; (S, K, TA;) like as
you say, هُمَا سَوَآءٌ and هُمَا سِيَّانِ: (S, TA:) and
عِنْدِى زَوْجُ نِعَالٍ, meaning [I have] two [sandals]; and زَوْجَانِ, meaning four: (Msb:) or
زَوْجُ حَمَامٍ as meaning a male and a female [of
pigeons] is a phrase which should not be used;
one to which the vulgar are addicted: (TA:)
IAmb says, the vulgar are wrong in thinking
that زَوْجٌ signifies two; for the Arabs used not to
employ such a phrase as زَوْجُ حَمَامٍ, but used to
say زَوْجَانِ مِنَ الحَمَامِ, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) meaning
a male and a female; (TA;) and زَوْجَانِ مِنَ الخِفَافِ,
(Mgh, Msb, TA,) meaning the right and the
left [of boots]: (TA:) nor did they apply the
term زَوْجٌ to one of birds, like as they applied the
dual, زَوْجَانِ, to two; but they applied the term
فَرْدٌ to the male, and فَرْدَةٌ to the female: (Mgh,
Msb:) Es-Sijistánee, also, says that the term زَوْجٌ
should not be applied to two, neither of birds nor
of other things, for this is a usage of the ignorant;
but to every two, زَوْجَانِ: (Msb:) Az says that
the grammarians disapprove the saying of ISh
that زَوْجٌ signifies two of any things, (Mgh, *
TA,) and that زَوْجَانِ مِنْ خِفَافٍ signifies [Two
pairs of boots, or] four [boots]; for زَوْجٌ with
them signifies one [of a pair or couple]: a man
and his wife [together] are termed زَوْجَانِ: and
ثَمَانِيَةَ أَزْوَاجٍ in the Kur [vi. 144 and xxxix. 8]
means Eight ones [of pairs or couples]: the
primary meaning of زَوْجٌ being that first mentioned in this paragraph; (TA:) in the Kur
xxii. 5 and 1. 7 [it seems to be implied that it
means pair or couple; but more probably in these
instances] it means sort, or species: (Bd, Jel:)
it is also expl. by the word لَوْنٌ [used in this last
sense]: (T, TA;) in the Kur xxxviii. 58, its pl.
أَزْوَاجٌ means أَلْوَانٌ and أَنْوَاعٌ [i. e. sorts, or species]
of punishment: F explains the sing. as meaning
لَوْنٌ مِنَ الدِّيبَاجِ وَنَحْوِهِ [a sort, or species, of silk
brocade and the like]; but his restricting the
signification by the words من الديباج ونحوه is
not right, as is shown by a citation, in the T, of
a verse of El-Aashà, in which he uses the phrase
كُلُّ زَوْجٍ مِنَ الدِّيبَاجِ [every sort, or species, of
silk brocade], as an ex. of زوج in the sense of
لون. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] A woman's husband:
and a man's wife: in which latter sense ↓ زَوْجَةٌ
is also used; (S, M, A, Mgh, * Msb, K; *) as in a
verse of El-Farezdak cited in art بول, conj. 10;
(S, Mgh;) but it is disallowed by As; (TA;)
and the former word is the one of high authority,
(Mgh, Msb,) and is that which occurs in the
Kur, in ii. 33 and vii. 18, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,)
and in iv. 24, (Mgh, TA,) and in xxxiii. 37:
(Mgh:) AHát says that the people of Nejd call a
wife ↓ زَوْجَةٌ, and that the people of the Haram
use this word: but ISk says that the people of
El-Hijáz call a wife زَوْجٌ; and the rest of the
Arabs, ↓ زَوْجَةٌ: the lawyers use this latter word
only, as applied to a wife, for the sake of perspicuity, fearing to confound the male with the
female: (Msb:) the pl. of زَوْجٌ is أَزْوَاجٌ (Msb,
K *) and زِوَجَةٌ; (K;) and the pl. of ↓ زَوْجَةٌ is
زَوْجَاتٌ (A, Mgh, Msb) and أَزْوَاجٌ also; (A,
Msb;) and أَزَاوِيجُ occurs [as a pl. pl., i. e. pl. of
أَزْوَاجُ,] in a verse cited by ISk. (TA in art. نأج.)
―
-b3-  [Hence also,] A consociate, an associate, or a
comrade: (A:) its pl. in this sense is أَزْوَاجٌ, (S,
A, K,) occurring in the Kur xxxvii. 22. (S, A.)
―
-b4-  And A fellow, or like: pl. أَزْوَاجٌ: in this
sense, each one of a pair of boots is the زوج of
the other; and the husband is the زوج of the
wife; and the wife, the زوج of the husband.
(TA.) You say, عِنْدِى مِنْ هٰذَا أَزْوَاجٌ I have, of
this, fellows, or likes. (TA.) ―
-b5-  As used by
arithmeticians, (Mgh, Msb,) contr. of فَرْدٌ; (S,
Mgh, Msb, K;) i. e. it signifies An even number;
a number that may be divided into two equal
numbers; (Msb;) as, for instance, four, and
eight, as opposed to three, and seven: (Mgh:) pl.
أَزْوَاجٌ. (S, Mgh.) One says زَوْجٌ أَوْ فَرْدٌ [Even
or odd?], like as one says خَسًا أَوْ زَكًا [or rather
زَكًا أَوْ خَسًا] and شَفْعٌ أَوْ وِتْرٌ. (S, Mgh.) ―
-b6-  Also
A [kind of cloth such as is termed] نَمَط [q. v.]:
or silk brocade; syn. دِيبَاجٌ: (TA:) or a نَمَط
that is thrown over the [kind of vehicle called]
هَوْدَج. (S, K, TA.)
زِيجٌ: see art. زيج.
زَوْجَةٌ: see زَوْجٌ, in four places, in the latter
half of the paragraph.
زَوْجِيَّةٌ and ↓ زَوَاجٌ [The marriage-state, or
simply marriage]: the latter is a subst. from
زَوَّجَ, [i. e. a quasi-inf. n.,] like سَلَامٌ from سَلَّمَ,
and كَلَامٌ from كَلَّمَ. (Msb.) You say, بَيْنَهُمَا
حَقُّ الزَّوْجِيَّةِ and ↓ الزَّوَاجِ [Between them two is
the right of the marriage-state, or of marriage]:
(A, Msb:) and الزِّوَاجِ is also allowable as [an
inf. n. of 3,] coordinate to المُزَاوَجَة. (Msb.)
زَوَاجٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two
places.
زَائِجَةٌ: see art زيج.
مِزْوَاجٌ A woman who marries often: (S, K:)
one who has had many husbands. (K.)
