instance, صَوْغ is an inf. n. (O, K, TA) used as a
subst., (O, TA,) in the sense of ↓ المَصُوغ, which
means مَاصِيغَ [i. e. the thing that has been melted,

صِيغَةٌ is originally صِوْغَةٌ, (S, O, Msb,) the و

it: (S O:) it is like قِيمَةٌ. (Msb.) [Its primary
signification is A mode, or manner, of صَوْغ i. e.
melting, and pouring forth into a mould; &c.:
and hence it signifies a make, form, fashion,
mould, or cast:] and it is syn. with صِيَاغَةٌ, q. v.:
(TA:) and signifies the making [a thing]; and
making according to a certain measure or proportion [and the like]. (Msb.) One says سِهَامٌ صِيغَةٌ

(TA;) of the make of one man. (S, O, K, * TA.)

(Msb.) And هُوَ حَسَنُ الصِّيغَةِ (tropical:)  He is goodly in

And هُوَ مِنْ صِيغَةٍ كَرِيمَةٍ (tropical:)  He is of a generous
origin. (Ibn-' Abbád, Z, O, K, TA.) And صِيغَةُ

Hijáz, (S, O,) originally صَيْوَاغٌ, (IJ, O, TA,) thus
altered by some, from صَيْوَاغٌ to صَيَّاغٌ, because of
their disliking the double و, (IJ, TA,) One who
practises, or performs, the craft, art, work, or
operation, termed صِيَاغَة [or melting gold &c., and
pouring it forth into a mould; &c.; as expl. in
the first sentence of this art.]; (S, O, Msb, K,
TA;) [generally meaning] a goldsmith, or worker
in gold: (MA, KL:) the pl. of صَائِغٌ is صَاغَةٌ
[originally صَوَغَةٌ] and صُوَّاغٌ and صُيَّاغٌ. (TA.)
One says, الحُلِىِّ ↓ هُوَ صَوَّاغُ [and صَائِغُهَا i. e. He
is the moulder of ornaments, or of women's ornaments, of gold or of silver &c.]. (TA.) [And
hence مِلْحُ الصَّاغَةِ lit. Goldsmiths' salt; meaning
chrysocolla, i. e. borax: thus termed in the language of the present day.] Aboo-Ráfi' the صَائِغ
is related to have said, كَانَ عُمَرُ يُمَازِحُنِى يَقُولُ
يَقُولُ اليَوْمَ وَغَدًا ↓ أَكْذَبُ النَّاسِ الصَّوَّاغُ [' Omar

men is the goldsmith, who says, To-day, and Tomorrow]. (TA.) And ↓ كَذِبَةٌ كَذَبَهَا الصَّوَّاغُونَ
[lit. A lie which the goldsmiths have told] is a
saying (of Aboo-Hureyreh, O) occurring in a
trad. (S, O.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] the pl. صُوَّاغٌ means
(tropical:)  Persons who alter speech, [embellish it with lies,]
and falsify it, or forge it: and ↓ صَوَّاغٌ, (tropical:)  one who
