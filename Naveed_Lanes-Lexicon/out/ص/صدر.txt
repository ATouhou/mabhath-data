and صُدُورٌ (A, TA) and مَصْدَرٌ (M, K) and مَزْدَرٌ
because of the similarity [of the letters ص and ز],

the meaning is, he tied a cord from the تَصْدِير
[or breast-girth] to the part behind [or beyond]
the callous lump on the breast of his camel, to keep
the تصدير in its place, when it had become loose

also ↓ صدّر, (S, * M, MA, K,) inf. n. تَصْدِيرٌ: the
latter verb is afterwards expl. in the K as meaning
بَرَزَ بِرَأْسِهِ; but this is a mistake. (TA.) Tufeyl
says, describing a horse,
مِنْ عَرَقٍ ↓ كَأَنَّهُ بَعْدَ مَا صَدَّرْنَ
سِيدٌ تَمَطَّرَ جِنْحَ اللَّيْلِ مَبْلُولُ
As though he were, after they had outreached
with their chests, from a row of [other] horses,
[a wolf that had exposed himself to rain during
a portion of the night, and had become wetted:]
but accord. to one relation, it is ↓ صُدِّرْنَ, meaning

sweat: the former reading, however is the better.

كَمَا شَرِقَتْ صَدْرُ القَنَاةِ مِنَ الدَّمِ
[And thou becomest, or wilt become, red by reason
of the saying that I have published, like as the
fore part of the spear becomes red from blood],
(S, * M,) he has made صدر fem. because the صدر
of the قناة is a part of the قناة; for they [sometimes] make a noun fem. when it is prefixed to a
fem. noun: (S:) or if you will, you may say that
he has made صدر fem. because he meant [thereby]
the قناة; and if you will, you may say that the

if it be correct, the prefixed noun [دآء] is suppressed. (Mgh.) [صَدْرُ الدَّجَاجَةِ, as said by Freytag, is the name of (assumed tropical:)  The star
γ of Cygnus.] ―

الصَّدَرِ, (K, TA, in the CK الصَّدْرِ,) i. e. The compassing of the Kaabeh on the occasion of the return
of the pilgrims from ' Arafát. (TA.) [Hence
also,] الصَّدَرُ The fourth day of the days of the

(S, TA,) or of going, or turning, away [from

―
-b2-  [Hence, مَصْدَرُ أَمْرٍ (tropical:)  The way of return from,
or of completing, a thing or an affair: opposed
to مَوْرِدُهُ.] One says, هُوَ يَعْرِفُ مَوَارِدَ الأُمُورِ وَمَصَادِرَهَا
(tropical:)  [He knows the ways of betaking himself to
things or affairs, and the ways of withdrawing
himself from them; or of commencing them and
of completing them]. (A.) [See also another ex.
in art. رحب, conj. 6.] ―
-b3-  And hence [also], the
مَصَادِر [pl. of مَصْدَر] of verbs: (S, TA:) مَصْدَرٌ
signifies (assumed tropical:)  The root of a word, from which proceed
the derivatives of verbs: (Lth, TA:) [in this sense
it is a conventional term of grammar and lexicology, not belonging to the classical language;
but on account of the importance of understanding
its true application in lexicology, it is necessary
to give here a full explanation of it: it is, agreeably with its etymology, the source (lit. place) of
derivation, accord. to the grammarians of ElBasrah; and is what I term an infinitive noun:
it is defined as] a noun signifying, by its original
application, an accident as subsisting in, or proceeding from, an agent (as الفَرَحُ [“ the being
joyful ”], الضَّرْبُ [“ the act of beating ”], and
القُعُودُ [“ the act of sitting ”]), or affecting an
object of action, (as الجُنُونُ [“ the being possessed by a jinnee ”]), conformable to its verb, so
as to comprise all the letters in that verb, either
literally (as in the instances above) or virtually
(as in القِتَالُ [“ the act of fighting ”], which wants
the ا that is before the ت in the verb, yet wants
it as to the letter only, and not virtually, wherefore
it is sometimes pronounced as if with the said
letter, as in قَاتَلَ قِيتَالًا, but the ا is changed into
ى on account of the kesr of the letter before it),
or substituting another letter for any of those
letters that it wants (as in العِدَةُ [“ the act of
promising ”], which wants the و that is in its
verb as to the letter and virtually, but has ة substituted for it [by way of compensation]): (from
a comparison of definitions &c. in the Expos. of
the “ Kitab Hodood en-Nahw ” by the author of
the work thus entitled, arts. مصدر and اسم مصدر;
the Expos. of the “ Shudhoor edh-Dhahab ” by
the author of the work thus entitled, section on
the nouns that govern as verbs; I' Ak; &c.:)
but the grammarians of El-Koofeh hold that the
verb is the root, and that the مصدر is derived
from it: (I' Ak p. 148:) some مصادر, moreover,
are derived from real (as opposed to ideal) substantives, as التَّحَجُّرُ [“ the becoming stone ”]
from الحَجَرُ [“ stone ”]. (Kull p. 327.) The
مصدر has the same government as its own verb:
it is often, and may be at pleasure, used as an
ideal subst. or abstract noun: and it is often
employed in the place of an act. or a pass. part. n.:
(Kull, &c.:) [when thus used as an epithet, it is
employed alike as sing. and pl. and masc. and
fem.:] accord. to Zj, every مصدر used as an
epithet is for ذُو [or ذَات &c.] followed by the
مصدر, and therefore it has no dual nor pl. [nor
fem.] form. (TA voce حَرَضٌ.) [It has also other
uses, which are expl. in the grammars. Used as
a مَصْدَر, it is sometimes made fem.; as it is also
when used in the sense of a noun that is properly
fem.: see صَرْفٌ, third sentence.] ―
-b4-  اِسْمُ مَصْدَرٍ,
called by some اِسْمٌ لِلْمَصْدَرِ, is a term applied to
[(assumed tropical:)  A quasi-infinitive noun; i. e.] a noun which is
not a مصدر, but which is occasionally used in the
place of a مصدر; like as a مصدر is used in the
place of an act. part. n., and in that of a pass.
part. n.: such as الوُضُوْءُ for التَّوَضُّؤُ [“ the performing of the ablution preparatory to prayer ”],
and الغُسْلُ for الاِغْتِسَالُ [“ the washing of oneself ”]; each of which wants somewhat that is in
its verb without substituting anything for that
which is wanting. (Expos. of the “ Kitáb el-
Hodood,” cited above.) This kind of noun the
grammarians of El-Koofeh and Baghdád allow
to govern as a مصدر; but the grammarians of ElBasrah hold that the noun governed in the accus.
case in each of the exs. adduced by the former as
confirmatory of their opinion is so governed by a
verb understood. (Expos. of the “ Shudhoor,”
ubi suprà.) It is also applied to A proper name
signifying an accident [or attribute]; as فَجَارِ
and حَمَادِ, proper names, by original application,
for الفَجْرَةُ and المَحْمَدَةُ [“ vice ” and “ praise ”]
and the like: and this kind does not govern as a
مصدر. (Expos. of the “ Kitáb Hodood enNahw,” ubi suprà; and Expos. of the “ Shudhoor,” ubi suprà.) It is also applied to [what is
more properly termed اِسْمٌ لِلْمَعْنَى الحَاصِلِ بِالمَصْدَرِ,
by some termed simply حَاصِلٌ بِالمَصْدَرِ, i. e. An
ideal substantive, or abstract noun;] a noun
applied to signify an accident [or attribute] considered abstractedly [such as صَدَرٌ signifying
“ return; ” and this kind is commonly termed in
the lexicons simply an اِسْم as distinguished from
a مصدر]. (Kull p. 327.) Some apply it also to
what is [properly] termed مَصْدَرٌ مِيمِىٌّ [i. e. A
مصدر commencing with an augmentative م], if
not of the measure مُفَاعَلَةٌ: but such is really a
مَصْدَر. (Expos. of the “ Shudhoor,” ubi suprà.)
