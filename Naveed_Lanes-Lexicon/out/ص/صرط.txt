-b2-  الصِّرَاطُ, also written with س, is likewise
[The name of] a bridge extended over the midst
of Hell, (K, TA,) sharper than a sword, and
thinner than a hair, over which the creatures
will pass, the people of Paradise passing over it
with their works, some like the blinding lightning,
and some like the wind sent forth, and some like
coursers, and some running, and some walking,
and some dragging themselves along; and a crier
will cry, from the lower parts of the empyrean,
“ Lower your eyes until Fátimeh, the daughter
of Mohammad, (may God bless and save him, and
may God be well pleased with her and her two
sons,) pass over; ” and the fire will say to the
believer, “Pass thou over, O believer, for thy
light hath extinguished my flame; ” and thereupon, the feet of the people of the fire will slip.
