صم1
صّمَّ, (S, M, Msb, K,) and صَمِمَ, which is
extr., (M, K,) [first pers. of each صَمِمْتُ,] aor.
يَصَمُّ, (M, Msb, K,) inf. n. صَمَمٌ (S, * M, Msb, K)
and صَمٌّ; (M, K;) and ↓ أَصَمَّ; (S, M, Msb, K;)
He was, or became, deaf; (M, * Msb, K; *) [or]
he had a stoppage of the ear, and a heaviness of
hearing. (M, K.) And صَمَّتِ الأُذُنُ, aor. as
above, inf. n. صَمَمٌ, The ear was, or became, deaf.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  [And He was, or became, as though
he heard not.] One says, صَمَّ عَنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  [He was as
though he heard not him, or it; he was deaf to
him, or it]; (M;) and عَنْهُ ↓ أَصَمَّ [meaning the
same]. (S, M.) ―
-b3-  [Hence صَمَّ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  He
or it, uttered, or made, no sound or noise; like
him who, not hearing, returns no reply to a call
or question; (assumed tropical:)  was dumb, or mute.] One says,
صَمَّتْ حَصَاةٌ بِدَمٍ (tropical:)  [A pebble made no sound in
falling upon the ground by reason of blood]; i. e.
the blood was so copious that if one threw a pebble
into it no sound would be heard in consequence
thereof, (As, S, M, Meyd, K, TA,) because it
would not fall upon the ground: (As, S, Meyd:)
the saying is a prov. (Meyd.) And hence the
saying of Imra-el-Keys, صمِّى ابْنَةَ الجَبَلِ, (S, K,)
in the following verse:
بُدِّلْتُ مِنْ وَائِلٍ وَكِنْدَةَ عَدْ
وَانَ وَفَهْمًا صَمِّى ابْنَةَ الجَبَلِ
(assumed tropical:)  [I have been given in exchange, for Wáïl and
Kindeh,' Adwán and Fahm: make no sound, O pebble: app. meaning that he would shed much blood]:
(S, TA: but this verse is omitted in one of my
two copies of the S:) or the meaning is, O echo;
(S, M, Meyd, K;) so they assert: (AHeyth,
TA:) or O calamity; the saying being a prov.;
(Meyd, TA;) applied to the case of a severe
calamity; as though meaning be dumb, O calamity; said by As to be applied in relation to an
event deemed excessively foul or evil: (TA:) or
O serpent; (Meyd, TA;) which is said to be the
primary meaning: (Meyd:) or O rock. (A Heyth,
K, TA. [See also the second of the sentences
here following.]) One says also, صَمَّ صَدَاهُ (tropical:)  [His
echo became dumb, or may his echo become
dumb;] meaning he perished, or may he perish.
(S, K, TA.) And ↓ صَمِّى صَمَامِ [in the CK erroneously written صُمِّى] meaning (tropical:)  Increase, O
calamity: (S, K, TA:) or it is applied to a man
who brings to pass a calamity, and means be
dumb, O calamity: (TA:) or صَمَامِ means calamity, and war; but primarily, the serpent; and
this saying, like صَمِّى ابْنَةَ الجَبَلِ, is a prov. said
when two parties refuse to make peace, and persist in opposition; meaning answer not the charmer,
O serpent, but continue as thou art wont to be.
(Meyd.) ―
-b4-  صَمَمٌ in relation to stones, (Lth, TA,)
or stone, (M,) [app. as an inf. n.,] signifies The

and in relation to a spear-shaft, the being compact; or compactness. (M.) One says, صَمَّ
الحَجَرُ, inf. n. صَمَمٌ, The stone was hard [and
solid]. (MA.) And صَمَّتِ الفِتْنَةُ, meaning [The
trial, or civil war, &c.,] was, or became, hard,
vehement, or severe. (Msb.)
-A2-  صَمَّ القَارُورَةَ, (S,
K,) or صَمٌّ رَأْسَ القَارُورَةِ, (M,) aor.
صَمُ3َ, (PS, [in a
copy of the M
صَمِ3َ, contr. to a general rule in the
case of a trans. verb of this class, and app. a
mistranscription,]) inf. n. صَمٌّ, (M,) He stopped
the flask or bottle [app. with a صَمَام]: (S, K:)
or he stopped the head of the flask or bottle, and
bound it; as also ↓ اصمّهُ: (K:) or اصمّ القَارُورَةَ
signifies he put a صِمَام to the flask or bottle. (S,
K.) ―
-b2-  And صَمَّ الجُرْحَ, aor.

struck vehemently. (IAar, TA.)
2
صمّم, said of a sword, (S, M, K, TA,) accord. to the K, signifies It struck the joint, and
cut, or severed, it: or i. q. طَبَّقَ: but this is at
variance with what is said by J and other leading
authorities; which is as follows: (TA:) it penetrated into the bone, and cut, or severed, it; but
when it strikes the joint, and cuts, or severs, it,
one says طَبَّقَ; a poet says, describing a sword,
يُصَمِّمُ أَحْيَانًا وَحِينًا يُطَبِّقُ
[It penetrates into the bone, &c., sometimes, and
at one time it strikes the joint, &c.]: (S, TA:) or
it passed into the bones: (M:) and ↓ صَمْصَمَ, said
of a sword, signifies the same: (M, TA:) or
تَصْمِيمٌ signifies a sword's penetrating into that
which is struck with it without its causing any
sound to be heard; from الصَّمَمُ in the ear. (Ham
p. 326.) ―
-b2-  And hence تَصْمِيمٌ signifies also (tropical:)  A
man's keeping constantly, or perseveringly, to the
thing that he purposes, until he attains [it].
(Ham ubi suprà.) One says, صَمَّمَ عَلَى كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He
kept constantly, or perseveringly, to his opinion
in respect of such a thing, after his desiring to do

with penetrative energy, or with sharpness, vigorousness, and effectiveness, (S, M, Msb, K, TA,)
in an affair, (M, Msb, K, TA,) and in journeying,
(S, K, TA,) in this case said of a horse, (Z, TA,)
and in other things; (S;) as also ↓ صَمْصَمَ. (K.)
―
-b4-  And (tropical:)  He bit, and infixed his canine teeth,
(S, K, TA,) and did not let go what he bit: (S,
TA:) or صمّم فِى عَضَّتِهِ he infixed his teeth [or

disease, M,) rendered him deaf; (S, * M, * Msb,

-b2-
[Hence,] أَصَمَّنِى الكَلَامَ (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, diverted me
from hearing the speech; as though he, or it,
rendered me deaf. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence, اصمّهُ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, caused him to be as though
he heard not. ―
-b4-  And hence, (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, caused
him, or it, to utter, or make, no sound or noise;
like him who, not hearing, returns no reply to a
call, or question; to be dumb, or mute.] One says,
أَصَمَّ اللّٰهُ صَدَاهُ (tropical:)  [May God make his echo to return
no sound;] meaning may God destroy him:
(TA:) a prov., said in imprecating death upon a
man; the صدي being that which returns the like
of his voice, or cry, from the mountains &c.; and
when a man dies, the صدي hears not from him
anything that it should answer him, so that it is
as though it were deaf. (Meyd.) [In the vulgar
language, ↓ صَمَّمَ likewise signifies (assumed tropical:)  He silenced
him, reduced him to silence, or closed his mouth:
so says De Sacy, in his Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed.,
iii. 379.] ―
-b5-  And اصمّهُ [in the CK اَصْمَمَهُ] also
signifies He found him to be أَصَمّ [i. e. deaf]. (S,
M, K.) One says, نَادَاهُ فَأَصَمَّهُ [He called him,

was deaf. (M.) And تصامّ عَنِ الحَدِيثِ (M, K)
and تصامّهُ (M) He feigned (M, K) to his companion (M) that he was deaf to the narrative, or
story. (M, K. *) تَصَامَمْتُهُ means تَصَامَمْتُ مِنْهُ
[or عَنْهُ], i. e. I made a show of being deaf [to it],
and feigned myself inattentive [to it]. (Ham p.
169.)

K,) the month thus named, (Msb,) which the
people of the Time of Ignorance called شَهْرُ اللّٰهِ

shouting يَا لَفُلَانٍ and يَا صَبَاحَاهْ, (M, K,) nor the
commotion of fight, (Kh, S, Msb,) nor the clash
of arms, it being one of the sacred months: (Kh,
S:) thus applied it is tropical, like نَائِمٌ in the
phrase لَيْلٌ نَائِمٌ; as though, in it, the man were
deaf to the sound of arms: (TA:) and in like
manner it is also called مُنْصِلُ الأَلِّ. (M. [See

right reading is evidently عِفَجَة, which is said in
the TA, in art. عفج, to be, like أَعْفَاجٌ, a pl. of
عَفَجٌ and its dial. vars.: see this last word:] thus
called [in my opinion because resembling a
meatus auditorius that is closed, and therefore
deaf; though said to be so called] because of its
hardness. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And نَاقَةٌ صَمَّآءُ (tropical:)  A fat she-camel: (K, TA:) and, (K,) or as some say,
(TA,) one that has just conceived, or become

K, TA,) which is forbidden in a trad., (TA,) is

is done in the case of] the شِمْلَة of the Arabs of
the desert with their [garments called] أَكْسِيَة [pl.
of كِسَآء]; (A'Obeyd, S;) i. e. the turning the
كِسَآء, from the direction of one's right, upon his
left arm and the part between his left shoulderjoint and neck, and then turning it a second time,
from behind him, upon his right arm and the
part between his right shoulder-joint and neck, so
as to cover them both: (A'Obeyd, S, K:) or the
wrapping oneself with the garment without making
to it a place from which to put forth the hand:
(Msb:) or, (K,) as the lawyers explain it,
(A'Obeyd, S,) it is the wrapping one's body and
arms with one garment, not having upon him
another, and then raising it [in the K, as is said
in the TA, يَضَعُهُ is erroneously put for يَرْفَعُهُ] on
one of its sides, and putting it upon his shoulder,
so that his pudendum appears from it: (A'Obeyd,
S, K:) [but] with the Arabs, لِبْسَةُ الصَّمَّآءِ means
the covering one's whole body with his garment,
and not raising a side from which to put forth
his hand: (Mgh:) when you say, of a man,
اِشْتَمَلَ الصَّمَّآءَ, it is as though you said, اِشْتَمَلَ
الشِّمْلَةَ الصَّمَّآءَ; for الصَّمَّآء is a sort of اِشْتِمَال. (S.
[See also اِشْتَمَلَ, and الشِّمْلَةُ الصَّمَّآءُ, in art. شمل.])
