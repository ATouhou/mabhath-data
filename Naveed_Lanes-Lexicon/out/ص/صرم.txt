[Now deliver thou to Benoo-Saad a message, and
to their chief, that the last milk in the udder
has been drawn]: (S:) the last two words [the
latter of which is written in the CK ↓ صَرامِ] are a
prov., meaning (assumed tropical:)  the excuse has reached its uttermost: (S, K:) thus says AO: (S:) IB says that
صُرَامُ in the saying of Bishr means the she-camel
that is termed ↓ الصَّرْمَآءُ, that has no milk; [i.e.
that the phrase means the she-camel that has now
