صمغ2
صمّغهُ, inf. n. تَصْمِيغٌ, He put صَمْغ [i. e.
gum] into it; (O, K;) meaning, into ink. (O.)
―
-b2-  And صمّغ بِالصَّمْغِ, inf. n. as above, He compacted the hair of his head [with gum]. (Msb.)
4
اصمغت الشَّجَرَةُ The tree produced صَمْغ
[i. e. gum]. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  Hence
one says, يُصْمِغُ فُوهُ His mouth is discharging
like a tree producing gum, and in like manner
أُذُنَاهُ his two ears, and عَيْنَاهُ his two eyes, and
أَنْفُهُ his nose. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.) And اصمغ
شِدْقُهُ The side of his mouth produced much
spittle. (O, K.) And اصمغ الرَّجُلُ (tropical:)  The man had
foam coming forth upon the sides of his mouth.
(Har p. 618.) And اصمغت الشَّاةُ is said of the
sheep or goat when her biestings are fresh (كَانَ
لِبَؤُهَا طَرِيًّا, Ibn-'Abbád, O, TA, in the K لَبَنُهَا, but
the former is the right, TA) [i. e. The sheep, or
goat, yielded fresh biestings] on the first occasion
of her being milked. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, TA.)
10
استصمغ الصَّابَ He scarified the species of
tree that produces صاب [q. v.] (S, O, K) in order
that its غِرَآء [meaning mucilage] might issue, (K,
TA,) i. e. (TA) in order that a certain bitter
substance might issue from it, and concrete like
صَبِر [i. e. aloes]: (S, O, TA:) thus expl. by Abu-I-Ghowth. (S.)
-A2-  And استصمغ He had a
صَمْغَة, i. e. a small swelling, or pustule. (Ibn-
'Abbád, O, K.)
صَمْغٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ صَمَغٌ, (K,) the
latter mentioned by ISd on the authority of AHn,
(TA,) [Gum; i. e.] the fluid that exudes from
the trees called عِضَاه and the like of these: (Msb:)
it is of many sorts: (S, O:) that which is called
الصَّمْغُ العَرَبِىُّ is the صَمْغ of the طَلْح, (S, O,
Msb,) which is said to be the same [tree] that is
called أُمُّ غَيْلَانَ: (Msb:) or the mucilage (غِرَآء)
of the [tree called] قَرَظ [and more commonly
سَنْط, i. e. the mimosa Nilotica, also called acacia
Nilotica]; and this is what is called الصَّمْغُ العَرَبِىُّ;
not the صَمْغ of the طَلْح; J [and others] having
erred [in asserting it to be this]: [but] every tree
also has صَمْغ: (K: [this last assertion, however,
is questionable; for صَمْغ seems to signify properly
gum, or juice that exudes from certain trees
and concretes:]) the n. un., (Msb, TA,) or term
applied to a portion thereof, (S, O,) is صَمْغَةٌ (S,
O, Msb, TA) and صَمَغَةٌ: (TA:) and the pl. is
صُمُوغٌ: (S, O, Msb, K:) among صُمُوغ [i. e. sorts
of صَمْغ], the مُقْل [q. v.] is said to be included;
but this is not known. (AHn, TA.) It is said in
a prov., تَرَكْتُهُ عَلَى مِثْلِ مَقْرِفِ الصَّمْغَةِ [I left him
in a condition like that of the place where the
piece of gum has been pared off]: this is when
one has left a person nothing; for the صمغة is
plucked off from its tree until there remains not
upon it what would retain one's life: (S, O:) or,
as some relate it, عَلَى مِثْلِ مَقْلَعِ الصَّمْغَةِ [in a
condition like that of the place where the piece of
gum has been plucked off]; (O, and so Meyd;)
meaning, without anything remaining to him;
because, when the gum is plucked off, there
remains not any trace of it. (Meyd.) And in a
trad. of El-Hajjáj occurs the saying, لَأَقْلَعَنَّكَ قَلْعَ
الصَّمْغَةِ [I will assuredly pluck thee away with the
plucking away of the piece of gum]; meaning I
will assuredly extirpate thee. (TA.) [―

صِمَغٌ (AZ, O, K) and ↓ صِمَغَةٌ, (K,) or the
latter is the n. un. of the former, and in like
manner صِمَخٌ and صِمَخَةٌ, the latter being the
n. un., (AZ, O,) or ↓ صِمْغٌ and صِمْخٌ, of which
↓ صِمْغَةٌ and صِمْخَةٌ are the ns. un., (Az, on the
authority of A 'Obeyd, TA,) A dry substance
which is found upon the teats (AZ, Az, O, K) of
a she-camel (AZ, O, K) or of a ewe or she-goat,
(Az, TA,) when she is milked on the occasion of

rent asunder (إِذَا فُطِرَ ذٰلِكَ [in the CK قُطِرَ]), the
milk is clear and sweet. (AZ, O, K.)
صَمْغَةٌ A small swelling, or pustule; syn. قَرْحَةٌ.

لَقِيتُ صَمْغَانَ, (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K,) and أَبَا
↓ صِمْغَةَ, (K,) I met him whose mouth and ears
and eyes and nose were discharging like the tree
producing gum. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.)
الصِّمَاغَانِ: see what next follows, in two places.
الصَّامِغَانِ, (IDrd, S, O, K,) like السَّامِغَانِ,
[q. v.,] (IDrd, O,) but the former is said by Mtr

(AO, O, K,) and ↓ الصِّمْغَانِ, (Lth, O, K,) The
two sides of the mouth, (S, O, K,) where the lips
meet [and conjoin], next the شِدْقَانِ: (O, K:) or
the two places where the spittle collects in the
two sides of the lip; (IAar, O, K;) called by the
vulgar الصَّوَارَيْن, (O in this art.,) or الصَّوَّارَيْن,
for الصِّوَارَانِ: (O and TA in art. صور:) or, as
some say, [strangely,] the hinder part of the
mouth. (TA.) It is said in a trad. that the
↓ صِمَاغَانِ are the two places where sit the two
angels [that note and record the actions of a
man]: a saying enjoining the use of the سِوَاك.
(TA.)
لَبَنٌ مُصْمِغٌ [app. Milk that is gummy; describing biestings not yet clear]. (TA voce
صُعْرُورٌ, q. v.) ―

first occasion of her being milked. (O, K, * TA.)
