صَاصَتِ النَّخْلَةُ, [aor. تَصِيصُ,] The palm-tree
bore dates which had become such as are termed
صِيص, i. e., شِيص; (K, * TA;) as also ↓ صيّصت,
(K,) inf. n. تَصْيِيصٌ; (TA;) and ↓ اصاصت, (K,)
inf. n. إِصَاصَةٌ; (TA;) all three on the authority of
IAar, and the first mentioned by Sgh, in the O;
and صَأْصَأَت, from صِئْصَآءٌ [a dial. var. of صِيصَآءٌ,
i. q. صِيصٌ]. (TA.)

صِيصٌ, in the dial. of Belhárith Ibn-Kaab, The
[bad] kind of dates called حَشَفٌ; (S;) i. q. شِيصٌ;
as also ↓ صِيصَآءٌ; (K;) صِيصٌ and صِيصَآءٌ being
dial. vars. of شِيصٌ and شِيصَآءٌ. (S.)
صِيصَةٌ: see صِيصِيَةٌ, throughout.
صِيصَآءٌ: see صِيصٌ. [It is also said to signify]
Dates without stones. (L in art. لقح.) ―
-b2-  Also
The pips of a colocynth that have no hearts,
(AHn, S, K,) being husks only; (AHn;) to
which a poet likens ticks that have been long left
in a desolate place: (AHn, S: *) and so, accord.
to some, of anything, such as the melon and the
cucumber and the like. (AHn.)
صِيصِيَةٌ, (S, IB, O,) or ↓ صِيصَةٌ, (K,) thus in all
the copies of the K, but it is a mistake, or a contracted form, (TA,) The weaver's [implement
called] شَوْكَة, with which he makes the warp and
the woof even: (S, IB, K:) but IB says that its
last radical letter is ى, not ص; so that it should
be mentioned among the class of infirm words:
(TA;) pl. صَيَاصٍ. (S.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (S,) The spur
of the cock. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also,] The horn
of the bull or cow, and of the gazelle: (K:) pl.
as above, (TA,) signifying the horns of bulls or
cows; which were sometimes fixed upon spears,
instead of the iron heads: (S:) and to such horns,
called by this name, conflict and faction, or sedition, (فِتْنَة,) is likened in a trad., because of its
grievousness: some say that the sing. is صِيصَةٌ,
[as in the K,] contracted. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And hence,
(TA,) A wooden pin, or peg, with which dates
are plucked out [when they are compacted in a
mass, closely adhering together, in the receptacle
of woven palm-leaves, or the like, in which they
are packed]: (K:) likened to the horn of a bull
or cow: in this sense, the word is written صِيصَةٌ:
and a certain poet changes it to صِيصَجّ. (TA.)
―
-b5-  [Hence also,] Anything with which one defends himself: pl. as above, (K,) [in the CK
erroneously written صَيَاصِى, as though it had the
article ال prefixed to it, or were itself prefixed to
another noun, for otherwise it is written and pronounced] with the [final] ى elided. (TA.) ―
-b6-
[Hence also,] A fortress: (K:) pl. in this sense
as above. (S, TA.) ―
-b7-  [Hence also,] A pastor
who manages [and protects] well his herds or
flocks: (AA, K:) in this sense also written صِيصَةٌ.
(AA, as in the TA.)
