[And they bade farewell to one affected with
desire, whose heart they had smitten; the love of
them, if God had not prevented it, had been his
slayer]. (S. [But this verse may be well rendered as an ex. of صَرَاهُ in the sense next following,
which is also a meaning of مَنَعَهُ: in the M, it is
cited as an ex. of صَرَاهُ in the sense of دَفَعَهُ.]) ―

بِالأَعْنَاقِ [They bent, or inclined, with the necks].

عَطَفَهُ He bent, or inclined, it.] Accord. to Ibn-Buzurj, صَرَتِ النَّاقَةُ عُنُقَهَا means The she-camel

ex. in a verse of Suleyk there cited: in the M and
TA صَرَايَا, which I think a mistranscription]: in
the other of my copies of the S omitted:) one
thereof is termed ↓ صَرَايَةٌ. (S, M, K. *) [In the
