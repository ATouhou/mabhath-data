صمجصَمَجٌ [Lamps of the kind called] قَنَادِيلُ [pl. of
قِنْدِيلٌ]: one of which is called صَمَجَةٌ: (S, K:
[in the K, the former word is called pl. of the
latter; but it is a coll. gen. n:]) an Arabic word,
an exception to the rule that ص and ج cannot
both occur in a genuine Arabic word: (TA:) or
of Greek origin (رُومِىٌّ), arabicized: (S:) EshShemmákh says,
وَالنَّجْمُ مِثْلُ الصَّمَجِ الرُّومِيَّاتْ
[And the asterism, meaning the Pleiades, like the
Greek lamps]: (S, MF:) but this does not show
the word to be Greek, as the epithet may be added
for the purpose of restriction. (MF.)
