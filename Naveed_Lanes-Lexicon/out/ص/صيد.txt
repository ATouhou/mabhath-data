Sb mentions, as a phrase of the Arabs, صِدْنَا قَنَوَيْنِ
meaning صِدْنَا وَحْشَ قَنَوَيْنِ: قَنَوَانِ being the name
of a certain land [or of two mountains]. (M.)
And الصَّقْرُ يَصِيدُ [The hawk preys]. (Msb and
K in art. صقر.) ذَوَاتُ الصَّيْدِ is applied to beasts

-b2-  [Hence,] one says,
هُوَ يَصِيدُ النَّاسَ بِالمَعْرُوفِ (tropical:)  [He captivates men by
goodness, beneficence, or kindness]. (A.) ―
-b3-  And
اِقْتَصِدْ تَصِدْ (tropical:)  Aim thou at that which is right and

M, L;) and صَادَ, (Lth, M, L,) [aor. يَصِيدُ;] He
(a camel) had the disease termed صَيَدٌ [expl.
below]: (Lth, S, M, L:) the ى in صَيِدَ is preserved unchanged because it is so preserved in the
original form, which is ↓ اِصْيَدَّ, (S,) though they
may not have said اِصْيَدَّ; (Sb, M;) and the like
is the case in عَوِرَ: (Sb, * S, M: *) the augmentative letters are rejected for the purpose of alleviation: hence, one does not say, in the case of verbs
of this class, مَا أَفْعَلَهُ, [i. e. مَا أَصْيَدَهُ, and مَا أَعُوَرَهُ,
and the like,] forming thus verbs of wonder,
because the original form is augmented, and a
verb of four letters cannot be formed from a verb
of four letters, for a measure can only be formed
from a measure that is less. (S.) Also, both
verbs, (the former accord. to the S and M, and
↓ the latter likewise accord. to the M,) (assumed tropical:)  He (a
man) was unable to look aside, (S, M,) by reason
of disease. (S.) And صَيِدَ, inf. n. صَيَدٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He
raised his head, by reason of pride: and (assumed tropical:)  he (a

neck. (K, TA.)

neck. (K, TA. [See also 4.])

اصادهُ He made him, incited him, or induced

(K;) namely, a camel. (TK.) ―
-b2-  And He cured
him (i. e. a camel, TK) of the disease termed صَيَد,
(K, TA,) by burning with a hot iron. (TA.)
Thus it has two contr. significations. (K.) ―

have the disease termed صَيَد. (M.)

to seize an opportunity, (A,) applied to a man
who seeks another to execute blood-revenge upon

suffer him to escape, or rather be not thou rendered hopeless of him]. (Meyd. [See also Freytag's Arab. Prov. i. 712; where تُحْرَمُهُ is put in
