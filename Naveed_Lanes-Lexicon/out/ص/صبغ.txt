and صِبَغٌ (As, O, K) and صِبَغَةٌ, (AHn, TA,) [of
which last, صِبْغَةٌ (q. v.), also said to be an inf. n.,

He dyed it, or coloured it; (K TA;) namely,
a garment, or piece of cloth; (S, O, Msb, TA;)

to blackness or redness or yellowness [&c.].

يَدَهُ بِالمَآءِ (As, O, K) and فِى المَآءِ (TA) (tropical:)  He
dipped, or immersed, his hand, or arm, in the

عِنْدَكَ mean They pointed me out to thee as one
who would accomplish what thou desiredst of me;
from the saying of the Arabs, صَبَغْتُ الرَّجُلَ بِعَيْنِى
and بِيَدِى I pointed at the man with my eye and

a mistake; that the Arabs when they mean thus

(S, Msb,) which is the meaning of فِطْرَةَ اللّٰهِ;
(Msb;) the religion of God, with an adaptation
to which mankind are created; because its effect
appears in him who has it like the dye in the garment; (Bd, Jel;) or because it intermingles in
the heart like the dye in the garment; (Bd;) and
it is said to be from the Christians' صَبْغ [or صَبْغَة
i. e. baptism] of their children in a sort of water
that they have; (S; [and the like is said in the
O, and Ksh, & c.;]) صبغة being in this instance in

to the baptism of the Christians, (Ksh, Bd,) a
corroborative of the saying آمَنَّا [in verse 130], as

by reason of a verb understood, (Jel,) the meaning being صَبَغَنَا اللّٰهُ صِبْغَتَهُ [God hath baptized us
with his baptism]; (Ksh, Bd, Jel; *) [so that
صِبْغَةَ اللّٰهِ signifies the baptism of God, and may
here be rendered We have received the baptism
of God;;] the Muslims being hereby commanded
to say to the Christians, “Say ye, God hath baptized us (صَبَغَنَا) with the faith, with a baptism
(صَبْغَة) not like ours [i. e. not like our Christian
baptism], and purified us with a purifying not like
ours; ” or the Muslims being hereby commanded
to say [of themselves], “God hath baptized us
(صَبَغَنَا) with the faith, as a baptism (صِبْغَةً), and
we have not been baptized with your baptism
(لَمْ نُصْبَغْ صِبْغَتَكُمْ). ” (Ksh.)

[Which may mean The most lying of men, or of
the most lying of men, are the dyers and the goldsmiths; or (assumed tropical:)  those who colour, and those who
transform, information, or discourse]: El-Khat-
tábee says, the meaning is, that the persons who
practise the two crafts to which these words relate
make many promises as to returning the goods,
and often break their promises; wherefore they
are said to be of the most lying of men; not that
every one of them is one who lies: but he adds
that it has been said to mean the moulding and
colouring of speech with falsehood. (O.)

that grows in the sands, resembling the ضَعَة
[which is applied to a species of the ثُمَام], which
is one of the abodes of the gazelles in the hot season,
lurking-places being excavated by them at its
roots: accord. to another, of the Arabs of the

simply dyed garments]. (S.)
