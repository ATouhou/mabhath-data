تَصْدِيَةٌ signifies The clapping with the
hands; syn. تَصْفِيقٌ; (S, K;) accord. to Er-Rághib, as being like the echo (الصَّدَى), inasmuch
as there is no profit in it; (TA;) or it is from
الصَّدُّ, because they [who practised it in their
worship] used to turn away (كَانُوا يَصُدُّونَ) from
El-Islám; (K;) [see more in the second paragraph
of art. صد;] and صَدْوٌ [an inf. n. of which the verb
is ↓ صَدَا] signifies the same; (K;) and so ↓ تَصَدٍّ,
of which AHeyth cites as an ex. the saying of
Hassán
صَلَاتُهُمُ التَّصَدَّى وَالمُكَآءُ
[Their prayer is the clapping with the hands, and
whistling: like the saying in the Kur viii. 35]:
(TA:) one says of a man, صدّى, (M,) or صدّى
بِيَدَيْهِ, (TA,) meaning He clapped with his
hands; (M, TA;) [said to be] originally صَدَّدَ;
(M;) and بِيَدَيْهِ ↓ صَدَا, inf. n. صَدْوٌ [mentioned
above], meaning the same. (TK.)
-A2-  also
مُصَدِّيَةٌ.

صاداهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُصَادَاةٌ, (S,) He imitated
him, or it; syn. عَارَضَهُ: (S, * K:) and he, or it,
corresponded, and was equal, to him, or it. (TA.)
In the Kur xxxviii. 1, some read صَادِ, with kesr,
as an imperative from المُصَادَاةُ (Bd, TA) as
meaning المُعَارَضَةُ; and hence الصَّدَى [i. e. the
echo], because it imitates (يُعَارِضُ) the first sound:
so that the meaning is, Imitate thou (عَارِض) the
Kur-án by thy works. (Bd.) ―
-b2-  [And] i. q. دَبَّرَهُ
[i. e. He considered, or forecast, its issues, or
results; did, performed, or executed, it with
thought, or consideration; or managed, conducted,
ordered, or regulated, it]; relating to an affair:
(M:) [or] المُصَادَاةُ signifies the turning about, or
revolving, the opinion, or idea, [that one forms]
respecting the management (تَدْبِير) of a thing,
and the doing of it: (Ham p. 35:) [or,] accord.
to As, the minding a thing attentively, carefully,
or solicitously: a man who had assisted his she-camel in her bringing forth said, بِتُّ أُصَادِيهَا طُولَ
لَيْلِى [I passed all my night minding her attentively, carefully, or solicitously]; because he disliked binding her fore shank to her arm, as it
would distress her; or leaving her, as she might
go away at random and the wolf might devour
her young one: and in like manner one says of
the pastor, يُصَادِى إِبِلَهُ [He minds attentively,
&c., his camels]; when they thirst before the
completion of their usual period of being kept
from drinking, he restricts them to journeying by
night so as to arrive at water on the morrow.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And He soothed, coaxed, wheedled, or
cajoled, him; or deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or outwitted, him; or strove, endeavoured, or desired, to do so: syn. دَارَاهُ, (S, M, K,
TA,) and دَاجَاهُ, and سَاتَرَهُ, (S, K, TA,) all of
which have one meaning, (TA,) [though the last
implies concealing enmity,] and لَايَنَهُ. (M.)
مَنْ صَادَاكَ فَقَدْ صَادَكَ [He who soothes thee, or
coaxes thee, surely ensnares thee] is a saying
mentioned in the A. (TA.)
4
اصدى It (a mountain) returned an echo.
(S, * K.) ―
-b2-  And He (a man, TA) died; (K,
TA;) as though [meaning] his echo ceased; the
| having a privative effect. (TA.)
5
التَّصَدِّى, accord. to Er-Rághib, signifies
The corresponding to a thing like as does the echo
returning from the mountain. (TA.) [But
accord. to others,] تصدّى لَهُ is originally تَصَدَّدَ;
(Az and L in art. صد;) and signifies تَعَرَّضَ, (S,
M, K,) and تَضَرَّعَ. (M.) [See 5 in art. صد;
where the usages of this verb, except in the senses
mentioned and indicated here below, are fully
explained.] ―
-b2-  It signifies also The feigning oneself unmindful, negligent, inattentive, inadvertent,
inconsiderate, or heedless, not being really so.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And The diverting oneself. (TA.) ―

صَدًى [sometimes written صَدًا] An echo; i. e.
الصَّدَى signifies what the mountain returns to
him who utters a sound, or voice, or cry, therein;
(K;) or the sound of the mountain and the like
that responds to one; (M;) or what responds to
one with the like of his voice, or cry, in the
mountains &c. (S.) One says, صَمَّ صَدَاهُ (tropical:)  [His
echo became dumb, or may his echo become dumb];
(S, TA;) meaning he perished, or may he perish:
(S and K and TA in art. صم:) and أَصَمَّ اللّٰهُ صَدَاهُ
(tropical:)  [May God make his echo to return no sound];
(S, K, TA;) meaning may God destroy him: (S,
K, and TA in art. صم:) for when a man dies, the
صدى hears not from him anything, that it should
respond to him. (S. [See also another explanation of this saying in what follows.]) ―
-b2-  And A
sound, voice, or cry, (M, TA,) in an absolute
sense. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also The part of the head,
(M,) or the part of the brain, (TA,) which is the
place [or seat] of hearing. (M, TA.) And therefore one says, أَصَمَّ اللّٰهُ صَدَاهُ [May God render
deaf the part of his brain which is the seat of
hearing]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And The brain, (M, K, TA,)
itself. (TA.) And The [entire] contents (lit. the
stuffing, حَشْو,) of the head; (M, K, TA;) also
called the هَامَة. (TA.) One says, صَدَعَ اللّٰهُ صَدَاهُ

head]. (M.) ―
-b5-  And A bird that cries in the
هَامَة [or head] of the slain when his blood has not
been avenged by retaliation: (M:) or a bird that
comes forth (M, K) from his head, (مِنْ رَأْسِهِ, M,)
or from the head of the slain, (K,) when he, or it,
has become consumed, or decayed, (M, K,) also
called the هَامَة; (M;) accord. to the assertion of
the people of the Time of Ignorance; (M, K;)
mentioned by A 'Obeyd; and some of them used
to say that the bones of the dead became a هَامَة,
which flew: pl. أَصْدَآءٌ: (TA:) and [this may be
meant by the saying that it signifies] the male of
the بُوم (S, M, K, TA) and هَام: pl. أَصْدَآءٌ: (M:)
they used to say that when a man was slain and
his blood was not avenged by retaliation, there
came forth from his head a bird like the بُومَة,
i. e. the هَامَة, the male being called the صدى;
and it cried upon his grave, اِسْقُونِى اِسْقُونِى [Give
ye me to drink, give ye me to drink, meaning, of
the blood of the slayer]; and if the slayer was
slain, it abstained from its crying: (TA:) and [it
is said that] it signifies also the body [itself] of a

corpse]. (Jm, TA.) ―

'Adebbes, (S,) [A cricket;] a certain flying
thing, that creaks by night, and hops, (S, K,)

TA,) and bulky: n. un. صَدَاةٌ. (TA.) ―

Az. (TA. [See also صَدْعٌ and صَدَعٌ.]) ―
-b9-  And
Knowing in respect of what is conducive to the
good of cattle: (K:) or صَدَى مَالٍ means thus:
(M:) or gentle in the management of cattle; like
إِزَآءُ مَالٍ: so in the Jm: (TA:) or, as some particularly say, of camels: (M, TA:) [i. e.] you say,
إِنَّهُ لَصَدَى إِبِلٍ, meaning Verily he is knowing in
respect of camels, and of what is conducive to
their good. (S.)
-A2-  Also Thirst: (S, M, K:) or
vehement thirst: (M:) [see the first paragraph,
in which it is mentioned as an inf. n.:] it is said
that thirst does not become vehement but the
brain dries, and therefore the skin of the forehead
of him who dies of thirst cracks. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See
also the next paragraph.
-A3-  And The act of the

thirsting vehemently: (M:) fem. [of the first]
صَدِيَةٌ (Msb) and [of the second] صَادِيَةٌ (Msb, K)
and [of the third] ↓ صَدْيَا: (S, M, Msb, K:) and
the pl. of صَادِيَةٌ is صَوَادٍ. (Ham p. 329.)

the leather [that forms its covering]. (TA.)
