صalphabetical letter
ص
The fourteenth letter of the alphabet; called صَادٌ.
It is one of the letters termed مَهْمُوسَة [or nonvocal, i. e. pronounced with the breath only,
without the voice]; and of the letters termed
أَسَلِيَّة, as also ز and س, because proceeding from
the tip of the tongue; (TA;) and is one of the
letters termed مُسْتَعْلِيَة, which are obstacles to
إِمَالَة: (M in art. صود:) it is not conjoined with
س, nor with ز, [nor, as some say, with ج, (see
إِجَّاصٌ,)] in any Arabic word. (TA. [See also
art. صود.]) It is a radical, and a substitute; not
an augmentative. (M in art. صود.) It is sometimes substituted for س; and, as MF observes,
what Ibn-Umm-Kásim says appears to mean that
this substitution is allowable unrestrictedly; but
Ibn-Málik, in the Tes-heel, makes it subject to
conditions, saying that it is allowable accord. to a
certain dial. when the س is followed by غ or خ
or ق or ط, even when separated therefrom by a
letter or by two letters: MF says that the dial.
above mentioned is that of Benu-l-'Ambar,
accord. to Sb and others; who give as exs.
صَغِبَ for سَغِبَ, and صَخِرَ for سَخِرَ, and صَقَبٌ for
سَقَبٌ, and صَطَعَ for سَطَعَ. (TA.)
-A2-  [As a numeral, ص denotes Ninety.]
