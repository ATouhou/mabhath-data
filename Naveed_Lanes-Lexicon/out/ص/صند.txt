of an army: (IAar, L:) جَمَاعَةُ العَسْكَرِ, by which
the pl. الصَّنَادِيدُ is expl. in the K, is a mistake
for حُمَاةُ العَسْكَرِ, the words used by IAar: (TA:)
a nobleman: a great man: (L:) or a great chief:
(Kf:) one who presides over a people and their
affairs of importance and things in general: or
a lord, or chief, eminent among his people, possessing the qualities of courage and liberality or
munificence or generosity, who overcomes those
that act with hostility and opposition towards
him: (MF:) pl. صَنَادِيدُ. (IAar, A, L.) Accord.
to some, the ن is augmentative; and the word is
derived from الصَّدُّ, “the act of turning away; ”
and seems to have been formed to denote an intensive signification. (MF.) Also Overcoming,
