صَلِفَ, (M, MA,) inf. n. صَلَفٌ, (M,) meaning

(TA:) [you say, تصلّف بِمَا لَيْسَ عِنْدَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He commended, or praised, himself for, or he boasted of,

epithet from the former verb is ↓ صَلِفٌ, (AZ, S,
M, O, K,) applied to a man, (AZ, S, M, O,) and
صَلِفَةٌ applied to a woman; (M;) and the pl. of
صَلِفٌ is صَلَافَى (AZ, M, K) and صُلَفَآءُ and صَلِفُونَ:
(AZ, O, K:) it is said to be from صَلِفٌ applied
to a vessel, accord. to IAar as meaning “ that
takes little water; ” but rather, as others say, as
meaning “ thick and heavy: ” the vulgar misapply it [app. by using it in the sense assigned
to it by IAar]. (TA.)

-A3-  اصلف القَوْمُ, (thus in the
O, on the authority of Ibn-'Abbád, [like أَحْزَنَ,
and its contr. أَسْهَلَ, &c.,]) or ↓ تصلّف, (thus in
the K, [but the former is preferable on the ground
of analogy, and the latter I think a mistake,])

صَلِفٌ, applied to clouds (سَحَاب, S, M, O, K),
Containing no water: (M:) or having little

so in some copies of the K,) or ↓ رُبَّ صَلَفٍ, (M,
O, and so in some copies of the K, [with an

cloud is there, [or many clouds are there, lacking
rain, or] having much thunder with little rain,
[beneath that which thunders:] (A'Obeyd, O:)
applied to the wealthy niggard: (A'Obeyd, O, K:)

with, or not beloved by, (S, M, O, K,) her husband,

صَلْفَآء and صِلْفَآء, and each with ة: see أَصْلَفُ,
in five places.
صَلِيفٌ The side (عُرْض [in one of my copies of
the S عَرْض, and in the other copy عِرق,]) of the
neck; the two being called صَلِيفَانِ; (S, O, K;)
[i. e.] الصَّلِيفَانِ signifies the two sides of the neck
(جَانِبَا العُنُقِ): or this signifies what are between
the لِيت [or part beneath the earring] and the
قَصَرَة [or base of the neck, on the two sides]: (M:)
or the two heads of the vertebra that is next to the
head, in the two sides of the neck. (AZ, O, * K, *
TA.) In this last explanation, in the copies of
the K, رأس is put for رأسا. (TA. [And in some
copies of the K, شِقَّيْهِمَا is there erroneously put for
شِقَّيْهَا, which, as is said in the TA, refers to the
neck.]) أَخَذَ بِصَلِيفِهِ and ↓ بِصَلِيفَتِهِ mean, accord.
to As, He took hold of the back of his neck:
(O, TA:) and one says also, ↓ أَخَذَهُ بِصَلِيفَتِهِ
meaning He took him, or it, altogether. (TA.
[But I think it not improbable that ↓ بِصَلِيفَتِهِ in
these two instances may be a mistranscription for
بِصَلِيفَيْهِ.]) ―
-b2-  الصَّلِيفَانِ signifies also Two staves,
or pieces of wood, which are placed across [horizontally] upon the [camel's saddle called] غَبِيط, by

O;) and the pl. is صَلَافٍ, (M, O, K, * [in the last,
erroneously, صَلَافِى, and in the O, correctly,
الصَّلَافِى, being made determinate,]) thus pluralized
in the same manner as صَحْرَآء because the quality
of a subst. is predominant therein, (M,) and [for
the same reason] أَصَالِفُ also; (O, K;) [the former
pl. of صلفآء, and the latter of اصلف:] or ↓ صَلْفَآء
(Ibn-'Abbád, O, K) and ↓ صِلْفَآء, [each, app.,
with tenween, the latter because of the measure
فِعْلَآء, and each because receiving the affix ة, for

ground: (K:) or a smooth rock, or a hard, smooth,
