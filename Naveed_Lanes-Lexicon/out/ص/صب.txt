بَعْدَ فُلانٍ [lit. Such a one drank the remains of
life after such a one], meaning (tropical:)  such a one
outlived such a one: (A, * TA:) and تَصَابَبْتُهُمْ

انصبّ It (water, S, M, and the like, M)
poured out or forth, or became poured out or
forth; (S, M, A, K;) as also ↓ صَبَّ, (M, Msb,
K,) aor.
صَبِ3َ, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. صَبِيبٌ; (Msb;)
and ↓ تصبّب, (M, K,) which is of a form rarely
occurring as that of a quasi-pass. of an unaugmented triliteral verb, being generally that of the
quasi-pass. of a verb of the form فَعَّلَ; (MF,
TA;) [but this app. denotes its doing so repeatedly;
and abundantly, like تَدَفَّقَ, q. v.;] and ↓ اصطبّ.

and من الجبل ↓ يَتَصَبَّبُ, (S, TA,) The water

TA.) And العَرَقُ ↓ تصبّب [The sweat flowed],
and الدَّمُ [the blood]. (A.) And عَرَقًا ↓ تَصَبَّبْتُ
[which may be rendered I flowed with sweat] is
a phrase of the Arabs, meaning تصبّب عَرَقِى [my
sweat flowed]: thus the act is literally ascribed to
the speaker, and what is essentially the agent
becomes a specificative: it is not allowable to say
عَرَقًا تَصَبَّبْتُ; for, as it is not allowable to put the
agent before the verb, so it is not allowable to put
the specificative, when it is virtually the agent,
before the verb. (IJ, M.) ―

اصطبّ المَآءَ is expl. by Sb as signifying He
took for himself the water; agreeably with general
analogy: (M:) [but it is more properly rendered

اِصْطَبَبْتُ لِنَفْسِى مَآءً مِنَ القِرْبَةِ لِأَشْرَبَهُ [I poured
out for myself water from the skin that I might
drink it]: and اِصْطَبَبْتُ لِنَفْسِى قَدَحًا [I poured

was, or became, intensely hot. (M, K, * TA.)
صَبٌّ is an inf. n. [and is] used [as an epithet]
in the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ, or of the
measure مَفْعُولٌ: (TA:) [thus it is used as an
epithet] applied to water, [meaning Pouring out
or forth, or poured out or forth,] like as are
سَكْبٌ and غَوْرٌ: (S, TA: [see also صَابٌّ and
صَبِيبٌ:]) and hence, in 'Alee's description of
Aboo-Bekr, when he died, كُنْتَ عَلَى الكَافِرِينَ
عَذَابًا صَبًّا (assumed tropical:)  [Thou wast, against, or upon, the
unbelievers, a punishment pouring forth, or
poured forth]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And [hence, app.,] one
says, ضَرَبَهُ ضَرْبًا صَبًّا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He smote him
with the edge of the sword [as though with a
smiting pouring down, or poured down]; as also
حَدْرً. (IAar, L, TA.) ―
-b3-  One says also, ضَرَبَهُ
مِائِةً فَصَبًّا, (TA,) or أَخَذَ مِائَةً فَصَبًّا, (A,) meaning,
(tropical:)  [He smote him with a hundred blows, or he took
a hundred,] and less than that, i. e. فَدُونَ ذٰلِكَ,
(TA,) contr. of فَصَاعِدًا; (A;) or and more [than
that], or above [that], i. e. like فَصَاعِدًا, (A, TA,)
i. e. مَا فَوْقَ ذٰلِكَ. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And عَلَيْهِ البَلَآءُ ↓ صُبَّ,
مِنْ صَبٍّ, meaning (tropical:)  [Trial, or affliction, was
poured upon him] from above. (A, TA.)
-A2-  Also,
applied to a man, Affected with excessive love, or
with attachment, or admiring love, (IAar, S, A, *
TA,) and desire: (S:) or with desire: (M, A, *
K:) or with tenderness of desire, (S, * M, A, * K,)
and ardour thereof: (S: * [see صَبَّ:]) or with
tenderness of love. (M, K.) One says, هُوَ صَبٌّ بِهَا
(and إِلَيْهَا (see صَبَّ)] He is affected with excessive
love of her; &c.: (A:) fem. صَبَّةٌ: (M, K:) dual
masc. صَبَّانِ, pl. masc. صَبُّونَ; dual. fem. صَبَّتَانِ,
pl. fem. صَبَّاتٌ: thus accord. to those who hold
رَجُلٌ صَبٌّ to be similar to رَجُلٌ فَهِمٌ and حَذِرٌ,
originally صَبِبٌ: (TA:) [hence it appears that
some hold صَبٌّ to be originally an inf. n., and
therefore use it as an epithet in its original form,
without regard to gender or number: but] accord.
to Sb, صَبٌّ is [originally] of the measure فَعِلٌ,
because you say صَبِبْتُ صَبَابَةً, like as you say
قَنِعْتُ قَنَاعَةً. (M.) See also 1, last sentence.
صُبٌّ: see صُبَّةٌ. ―
-b2-  Accord. to AO, it may also
be pl. of ↓ صَبُوبٌ or of ↓ صَابٌّ: but Az says that,
accord. to others, it is not pl. of either of these
two words; their pl. being صُبُبٌ: (L, TA:) it is
said in a trad., (S, L, TA,) respecting conflicts and
factions, or seditions, (L, TA,) لَتَعُودُنَّ فِيهَا أَسَاوِدَ
صُبًّا يَضْرِبُ بَعْضُكُمْ رِقَابَ بَعْضٍ: (S, L, TA:) here
by أَسَاوِد are meant “ [great and noxious] serpents: ” (L, TA:) and صُبًّا, accord. to Ez-Zuhree,
is from الصَّبُّ [“ the act of pouring out or forth ”];
for the serpent, he says, when it desires to bite,
raises itself, and then darts down (lit. pours down)
upon him that is bitten: (S, L, TA:) [as though
the meaning were, Ye will be, therein, like great
and noxious serpents, one portion of you smiting
the necks of another portion:] Ez-Zuhree says
that صُبًّا is pl. of ↓ صَبُوبٌ, and originally صُبُبًا;
like as رَجُلٌ صَبٌّ is originally صَبِبٌ; and so says
IAmb: but IAar is related to have said that
أَسَاوِد means companies, pl. of سَوَادٌ; and صُبًّا,
pouring, one upon another, with slaughter: and
some say that it is صُبَّى, in measure like حُبْلَى;
and it is said to be from صَبَا, [for صَبَا إِلَى الدُّنْيَا,]
aor. يَصْبُو, meaning “ he inclined to the things of
the present world; ” and thus to be like غُزَّى, pl.
of غَازٍ: [see صَابٍ, in art. صبو:] IAar used also
to say that it is originally صُبَّأً, with ء, [pl. of
صَابِئٌ,] from صَبَأً عَلَيْهِ “ he came, or came forth,
upon him unexpectedly. ” (L, TA.)
صُبَّةٌ A quantity of wheat or food, &c., that is
poured out or forth (M, K) together, or collectedly; (M;) also (M, K) sometimes (M)
termed ↓ صُبٌّ. (M, K.) See also 1, near the beginning. ―
-b2-  And A سُفْرَة [or piece of skin in
which the traveller puts his food; or the thing
upon which one eats]; (M, K;) so called because
the food is poured into it, or upon it: (M:) or a
thing like the سُفْرَة: (M, K:) and صُنَّةٌ, with ن,
signifies the same. (M.) ―
-b3-  See also صُبَابَةٌ, with
which it is syn. ―
-b4-  Also A company of men:
(M, Msb, K:) [app. tropical; but it is said that]
this is the primary meaning, and it is used in
relation to camels, and sheep or goats, and the
like, tropically. (TA.) ―
-b5-  (tropical:)  A detached number
of horses, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) and of camels, (A,
K,) and of sheep or goats, (A, Msb, K,) and of
dirhems, or pieces of money: (A:) or from ten to
forty: (A, K:) or from twenty to thirty and
forty of camels and of sheep or goats: or less
than a hundred (M, A, K) of camels: (M, K:)
or of camels i. q. صِرْمَةٌ: (S:) and from ten to
forty of goats: (AZ, S:) or a flock of sheep or
a herd of goats, as being likened to a company of
men: (TA:) or from twenty to forty of sheep and
of goats; or peculiarly of goats: or about fifty:
or from sixty to seventy: and of camels about
five or six: (IAth, TA:) and a collection of
dirhems, or pieces of money, and of wheat, or
food, &c.: and a piece of a thing: (Msb:) [or] a
small quantity or portion of wealth or property.
(M, K.) ―
-b6-  And (assumed tropical:)  A part, or portion, of the
night: so in the saying, مَضَتْ صُبَّةٌ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ (assumed tropical:)  [A
part, or portion, of the night passed]. (S.)

erroneously written تَصَبُّب, TA,) of a river, or
rivulet, or channel of water, or of a road, down a
declivity. (M, L, K, TA.) ―
-b2-  And A declivity,
declivous place, or ground sloping down; (M, A,
K, TA;) and (TA) so ↓ صَبِيبٌ, of which the pl.
is أَصْبَابٌ; (S, TA;) so too ↓ صَبُوبٌ and ↓ صُبُوبٌ,
with fet-h and with damm; (TA;) [i. e.] ↓ الصَّبُوبُ
signifies that down which you descend, or have
descended, (مَا انْصَبَبْتَ فِيهِ,) and its pl. is صُبُبٌ
[like عُمُدٌ pl. of عَمُودٌ]; (M, TA;) [and so
↓ الصُّبُوبُ;] or, as some say, ↓ الصَّبُوبُ, with fet-h,
is a name for the water, &c., that is poured out upon
a man, like طَهُورٌ and غَسُولٌ; and ↓ صُبُوبٌ, with
damm, is pl. of صَبَبٌ: but AZ mentions his
having heard the Arabs apply ↓ صَبُوبٌ to a
declivity, or declivous place; and says that its pl.
is صُبُبٌ: (TA:) and الصَّبَبُ مِنَ الرَّمْلِ signifies
what has poured out or forth or down, of sand:
(M, K: *) and the pl. of صَبَبٌ is أَصْبَابٌ. (M, K.)
صُبَابٌ: see صُبَابَةٌ.
صَبُوبٌ [app. syn. with ↓ صَابٌّ as part. n. of the

colour of which juice is red tinged with blackness:
and some say, it is the expressed juice of the leaves
of the حِنَّآء [q. v.]. (S, TA.) ―

(tropical:)  [During many a night have I guided in the right
way young men infused with the remains of

may be pl. of the latter, [or rather a coll. gen. n.
of which صُبَابَة is the n. un.,] like as شَعِيرٌ is of
