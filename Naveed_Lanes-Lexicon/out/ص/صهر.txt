And A relation, or kinsman, or kinswoman, of a
man's wife: (Kh, S, A, Msb:) and of a woman's
husband: (A:) or the father or brother or other
kinsman of a woman's husband; syn. حَمْءٌ [and
حَمٌ &c. (see art. حمو)]: (Kh, As, ISk, Msb:)

to some of the Arabs: (Kh, As, S, Msb:) or none

and the husband of a man's daughter: and the
husband of a man's sister: (IAar, K:) Fr says
that, in the Kur xxv. 56, it signifies, a relation
whom it is lawful to marry; as the daughter of a
paternal uncle, and of a maternal uncle, and the
like: and نَسَب in the same, a relation whom it is
unlawful to marry: Zj, that the former signifies a
relation whom it is unlawful to marry: and the
latter, such as is not a صِهْر, of those mentioned in
the Kur [iv. 27], from the words “ your mothers
are forbidden unto you ” to the words “ and your
combining [as your wives] two sisters: ” I'Ab
explains نسب and صهر in the former passage of
the Kur differently from Fr [altogether], and
differently in part from Zj; saying that the former
applies to the seven relations first mentioned in
iv. 27 in the Kur, and صهر to the remaining six
there mentioned and that mentioned in the next
preceding verse; [so that it includes a man's
foster-mother, who has suckled him; his fostersister, who has been suckled with him; his wife's
mother; his step-daughter under his guardianship, born of his wife unto whom he has gone in;
his son's wife; his wife's sister combined with that
wife; and his father's wife;] and this, says Az,
is correct: (Mgh:) in the Kur xxv. 56, it means
ذُو صِهْرٍ, whether male or female: (Jel:) or ذَوَاتُ
صِهْرٍ: (Bd:) pl. أَصْهَارٌ (S, A, Msb, K, &c.) and
صُهْرَآءُ; (K;) which latter is extr. (TA.) [صِهْرَةٌ,
applied to a female, pl. ضِهَرَاتٌ, is app. postclassical.] ―
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A grave, or sepulchre: (ISd,
K:) for they used to bury their daughters alive,
and say, “We have married them to the grave: ”
then, in the time of El-Islám, this expression was
used, and it was said, نِعْمَ الصِّهْرُ القَبْرُ [An excel-lent son-in-law is the grave]: or it means, correctly, that which supplies the place of the صهر.
(ISd.)
صِهْرِىٌّ i. q. صِهْرِيجٌ [q. v.]; (K;) a dial. var. of
the latter word; signifying A thing like a حَوْض

is meant thereby voce سَاهُورٌ; of which it is a dial.
var. in this sense, and app. in other senses also.])
