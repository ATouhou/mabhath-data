صَكٌّ, (Mgh, * Msb, TA,) He struck him, or it:
(S, Mgh, O:) or he struck him, or it, vehemently,
with a broad thing; or in a general sense, (K,
TA,) with anything whatever: (TA:) or he
slapped him with his hand, i. e. struck him with
his expanded hand, (Msb,) like لَطَمَهُ, (TA in art.
لطث, &c.,) upon the back of his neck, and upon
his face. (Msb.) Hence, in the Kur [li. 29],
فَصَكَّتْ وَجْهَهَا (S, TA) And she slapped her face
with her hand; syn. لَطَمَتْهُ. (Jel.) And صَكَّ
البَازِى صَيْدَهُ The hawk, or falcon, struck his prey
with his foot, and so cast it down. (Ham p. 799.)
And [hence, app.,] one says, خُذْ هٰذَا أَوَّلَ صَكٍّ,
meaning أَوَّلَ مَا أَصُكُّ بِهِ [Take thou this on my
first striking with it]: and so أَوَّلَ صَوْكٍ (O,

are extr.,] a verb of the class of تَعِبَ, (Msb,)
inf. n. صَكَكٌ, (S, Mgh, * O, Msb, K, TA,) [in the
CK صَكِيكًا is erroneously put for صَكَكًا, and it
seems from what follows that صَكٌّ is also an inf. n.
like صَكَكٌ,] Thou wast knock-kneed: (S, O,
Msb:) or thou hadst a colliding (اِضْطِرَاب) of the
knees, and [when used in relation to an ostrich or
a horse or the like] of the عُرْقُوبَانِ [which evidently means here, as in many other instances,
the hocks]: (K:) [for] the verb is used in relation
to a man, (S, O, K, TA,) and to other than man:
(TA: [and the same is implied in the S and O,
as is shown voce أَصَكُّ:]) صَكَكٌ [sometimes
particularly] signifies the colliding of the knees
[or of the hocks] in running, so that it makes a
mark, or scar, upon each of them: (TA:) [and it
is said that] this word, (Mgh,) or صَكٌّ, (TA,
[perhaps a mistranscription for صَكَكٌ,]) signifies
the colliding of the عُرْقُوبَانِ. (Mgh, TA.)

knock together]. (S, O, Msb. *) And اِصْطَكُّوا
بِالسُّيُوفِ They struck one another with the swords.

The night of the middle [of the month] of Shaa-
bán; because in it are written the صِكَاك of the
allowances of subsistence [of individuals]: also
called لَيْلَةُ البَرَآءَةِ. (O, TA.) [Hence also] صَكُّ

prov., meaning I met him in the most vehement
heat of midday in summer when the heat almost
blinded by its vehemence: (Lh, O, TA:) for عُمَىّ
is said to be an abbreviated dim. of أَعْمَى: (S, O,
TA:) and by it is said to be meant the gazelle,
because he is dazzled and confounded in the
midday-heats of summer, and knocks against the
thing that is before him: some say, صَكَّةَ حُمَىٍّ,
from حَمِيَتِ الشَّمْسُ: and some assert that عُمَىّ

name of a certain man [as will be found expl. in
art. عمى, with variations of this saying]. (S, O,
K, TA.)

colliding (اِضْطِرَاب) of the knees, and [when used
in relation to an ostrich or a horse or the like] of
the عُرْقُوبَانِ [which evidently means here, as in
many other instances, the hocks]; as also ↓ مِصَكٌّ;
(K;) which latter [in this sense is rare, and is
written in the CK مَصَكٌّ, but] is with kesr to the
م: (TA:) thus applied to a man; (S, O, K, TA;)
and to other than man; (TA;) [i. e.] applied
also to a horse; (O;) and to an ostrich, because
he is long in step, long-legged, and sometimes,
or often, his رُكْبَتَانِ [here improperly used as
meaning “ hocks ”] being near together, his legs
strike each other: (S, O:) and a man is also said

the last paragraph of art. سهر; (O;) and ↓ أَصَكُّ
signifies the same: (K:) the fem. of the former is
with ة; (S, O, TA;) which is held by Sb to be
rare; for epithets of the measures مِفْعَلٌ and مِفْعَالٌ
seldom have ة affixed to denote the fem. (TA.)
―
