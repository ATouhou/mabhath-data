صَفَّ, (S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) aor.
صَفُ3َ,
(Msb, TA,) inf. n. صَفٌّ, (O, Msb, K, TA,) He
set, or placed, or stationed, (S, M, Mgh, O, K,)
a company of men, (S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) in
war (S, O, K) &c., (O, K,) and a military force,
(TA,) and also [in a similar sense] a thing, (Msb,)
in a rank, or row, or line: (S, M, Mgh, O, K:)
and likewise ↓ صفّف, (TA,) inf. n. تَصْفِيفٌ; (IDrd,
O, K, TA;) but this has an intensive signification.
(IDrd, O, TA.) ―
-b2-  One says also of a she-camel,
تَصُفُّ يَدَيْهَا عِنْدَ الحَلَبِ [She sets her fore legs
evenly, side by side, not putting one of them in
advance of the other, as if about to go onward,
on the occasion of being milked]. (S, M, O, K.)
[See also صَفَنَ, said of a man: and see صَانَ in
art. صون.]) And [in like manner] one says,
صَفَّتِ الإِبِلُ قَوَائِمَهَا [The camels set their legs in
an even row]. (S, O.) ―
-b3-  And of a she-camel
one says also, تَصُفُّ أَقْدَاحًا مِنْ لَبَنِهَا إِذَا حُلِبَتْ [as
though meaning She yields a row of bowls of
her milk when she is milked], because of the abundance of her milk. (S, O, K *.) And تَصُفُّ بَيْنَ
مِحْلَبَيْنِ أَوْ ثَلَاثَةٍ, (S, O,) or simply تَصُفُّ, (M,)
She combines two milking-vessels, or three, at one
milking; (S, * M, O; *) الصَّفُّ meaning her being
milked into two milking-vessels, or three, (S, O,
K,) so as to combine them. (S, O. [In the CK,
أَنْ تَحْلُبَ is a mistake for أَنْ تُحْلَبَ.]) And a
rájiz, cited by AZ, says, referring to a she-camel,
تَصُفُّ فِى ثَلَاثَةِ المَحَالِبِ
[She is milked into three milking-vessels at one
milking]. (S, O.) One says also صَفَّهَا, i. e. حَلَبَهَا صَفًّا
[app. meaning He milked her into two bowls, or
three, at one milking; or into two bowls; the
pronoun referring to a she-camel]. (M. [One or
the other of these two meanings appears to be
indicated by what there precedes this.]) ―
-b4-  صُفَّ
عَلَى الجَمْرِ لِيَنْشَوِىَ (S, K) is said of flesh-meat
(S) [app. meaning It was laid, cut into a strip,
or into strips, upon the live coals to broil]; and
فِى الشَّمْسِ لِيَجِفَّ [in like manner, in the sun to
dry]: (K:) for one says of him who has prepared
flesh-meat cut into strips, or oblong pieces, and
dried in the sun, صَفَّ اللَّحْمَ; and [in like manner]
one says also, صَفَّهُ عَلَى النَّارِ لِيَنْشَوِىَ: (Msb:) or
صَفَّ اللَّحْمَ, aor.
صَفُ3َ, inf. n. صَفُّ, means he cut
the flesh-meat into broad slices: (M:) and accord.
to ISh, ↓ التَّصْفِيفُ is like التَّشْرِيحُ, i. e. the cutting
a piece of flesh-meat thin, so that it is translucent: (TA in the present art:) or التصفيف is a
kind of تَشْرِيح; i. e. the cutting a piece of flesh-meat thin, so that it is translucent by reason of
its thinness, and then throwing it upon the live
coals. (TA in art. شرح.) [See صَفِيفٌ.]

also 8, in three places. ―
-b2-  صَفَّ said of a bird,
(M, O, Msb, K,) aor.
صَفُ3َ, (M, Msb,) inf. n. صَفٌّ,
(Msb, K,) It extended its wings in a line, (M,)
or it expanded its wings, (O, Msb, K,) in the sky,
and did not move them, (M,) or and struck [an
evident mistake for and did not strike] with them
its sides like the pigeon: (Msb:) such as do so
are not to be eaten; (Msb, K;) as the vulture
and the hawk: (Msb:) it is said in a trad.,
يُؤْكَلُ مَا دَفَّ وَلَا يُؤْكَلُ مَا صَفَّ. (O, K, TA. See
art. دف.)
-A3-  صَفَفْتُ لِلسَّرْجِ, (S,) or صَفَفْتُ لِلسَّرْجِ
صُفَّةً, (O,) or صَفَفْتُ السَّرْجَ, (K, and so in one
place in the O,) and ↓ أَصْفَفْتُهُ, (O, K,) but this
latter verb is of weak authority, (O,) (tropical:)  I put to
the horse's saddle a صُفَّة [q. v.]: S, O, K, TA:)
[and] صَفَّ الدَّابَّةَ, and صَفَّ لَهَا, He made for the
beast a صُفَّة. (M.)

صَفَّ3َ see above, first sentence: ―
-b2-  and also in the
latter half of the paragraph.

صَافُّوهُمْ (S, MA, O,K) فِى القِتَالِ (S, O, K)

صُفَّة of his house over against, or facing, his
(another's) صُفَّة. See هُوَ مُصَافِّى, below.]

تَصَاْفَ3َ see 8. ―
-b2-  One says also تصافّوا عَلَيْهِ They
collected themselves together in a rank, or row, or
line, against him. (M, TA.) And تصافّوا عَلَى المَآءِ
They collected themselves together at the water;
as also تضافّوا عَلَيْهِ: like as one says تصوّك فِى
خُرْئِهِ and تضوّك, and صَلَاصِلُ المَآءِ and ضَلَاضِلُهُ.
(Lh, TA.)
8
اصطفّوا They stood in, (S, Mgh, O, K,) or
became, (M,) [or set, placed, or stationed, themselves in,] a rank, or row, or line; (S, M, Mgh,
Msb; *) or ranks, or rows, or lines; (O, K;) as
also ↓ تصافّوا; (M, O, * K; * [التَّصَافُّ being expl.
in the O and K by التَّسَاطُرُ; in the CK, erroneously, التَّشاطُرُ;]) and so ↓ صَفُّوا, (M, Mgh, Msb,)
aor.
صَفُ3َ, (M, Mgh,) inf. n. صَفٌّ and صَفَّى, but
[ISd says] this latter inf. n. I have not heard except in a phrase mentioned in what follows. (M.)
Hence the saying,تَصُفُّ ↓ النِّسَآءُ خَلْفَ الرِّجَالِ وَلَا  
تَصُفُّ مَعَهُمْ [The women shall stand in a rank behind the men in the mosque, and shall not stand
in a rank with them]. (Mgh.) And hence the
saying of a woman of the desert to her sons,
↓ إِذَا لَقِيتُمُ العَدُوَّ فَدَغَرَى وَلَا صَفَّى i. e. [When ye
meet the enemy, rush upon them without consideration, and] do not set yourselves in a rank.
(M. [See also 1, in art. دغر.])
R. Q. 1
صَفْصَفَ He journeyed, (سَارَ, O, and
so in copies of the K,) or became, (صَارَ, so in the
CK,) alone in a صَفْصَف, or level tract of land.
(O, K.)
-A2-  And He pastured upon the trees
called صَفْصَاف. (O, K.)
-A3-  And صَفْصَفَةٌ [as an
inf. n., or as a simple subst.,] signifies The crying
or cry, (صَوْت,) of the sparrow, which is called
صُفْصُف (O, K) in some one or more of the
dialects. (O.)
صَفٌّ A rank, row, or line [of things]; (KL,
PS;) or an even صَدْر [i. e. front, or fore part,]
of any things: (M:) and a company of men
standing in a rank, or row, or line: (O, K:)
pl. صُفُوفٌ; (S, M, O, Msb, K;) and the sing.
may also be used in the sense of the pl.; it may
be used either thus in the sense of the pl. or as a
sing. in the Kur xviii. 46. (O.) Hence, in a
trad., سَوُّوا صُفُوفَكُمْ [Make even your ranks] in
prayer. (O, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also A station of صُفُوف
[or ranks of men]. (M. [See also مَصَفٌّ.]) And
hence, (M,) as used in the Kur xx. 67, i. q. مُصَلًّى
[i. e. A place of prayer, or a place of prayer on
the occasion of the عِيد, or festival]; (Az, M, O;)
because the people stand there in ranks: (M:)
i. e. a place where people assemble for their عِيد:
(Az, O:) or, in that instance, صَفًّا may mean
مُصْطَفِّينَ [i. e. standing in ranks], (Az, M, O,)
as a denotative of state. (M.) ―
-b3-  And A pair of
bowls (قَدَحَانِ) [app., as seems to be indicated,
that are filled at one milking of a camel]; because they are put together. (M.)

certain medicament with which the teeth are
whitened. (O.)
صُفَّةٌ An appertenance of a house, (S, Mgh, O,
Msb, K, [in none of which is it explained,]) or of
a building, like a wide بَهُو [here used in a postclassical sense, as meaning a kind of vestibule, or
portico, for shade and shelter, open in front], with
a long roof or ceiling; (Lth, TA;) the طُرَّة of a
building [app. meaning what is above described];
(M;) i. q. سَقِيفَةٌ: (S and Msb and K in art.
سقف:) [see سَفِيفَةٌ; and see also سُدَّةٌ:] and i. q.
ظُلَّةٌ [i. e. a roof, or covering, for shade and
shelter, over the door of a house; or extending
from a house to another house opposite; like
سُدَّةٌ and سَقِيفَةٌ]: (M:) [for the meaning assigned
to it by Golius as from the S, and by Freytag as
from the K and S, (“ scamnum discubitorium,
fere ex lapidibus structum,”) I find no authority
in any Arabic work: in Egypt, it is applied to a
shelf of marble or of common stone, about four
feet high, supported by two or more arches, or by
a single arch, figured and described in the Introduction to my work on the Modern Egyptians;
this being app. so called because resembling in
form, though not in size, a porch:] the pl. is
صُفَفٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and صِفَافٌ and صُفَّاتٌ.
(Mgh.) أَهْلُ الصُّفَّةِ [The people of the صُفَّة] was
an appellation applied to certain persons who were
the guests of El-Islám, [i. e. supported by the
charity of the Muslims,] (O, K, TA,) consisting
of poor refugees, and houseless men, (TA,) who
passed the night in the صُفَّة of the mosque of the
Prophet [in El-Medeeneh], which was a covered
place, an appertenance of the mosque, (O, K,
TA,) roofed over with palm-sticks; (Har p. 379;
[where see more;]) thither they resorted for
lodging; and sometimes they were few, and sometimes they were many: [SM says,] I have drawn
up a list of their names, in a tract, to the number
of ninety-two, (TA in the present art.,) or ninetythree. (TA voce أَوْفَاضٌ.) [ISd says,] عَذَابُ يَوْمِ
الصُّفَّةِ [The punishment of the day of the صُفَّة] is
the same as عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ [mentioned in the
Kur xxvi. 189]: (M, TA:) Lth says that the
former was a day on which a certain people disobeyed their apostle, wherefore God sent upon
them heat and clouds which overspread them, so
that they perished: and Az says that it is not the
same as that mentioned in the Kur, and that he
knew not what is meant by عذاب يوم الصفّة: (O,
(TA:) it seems, however, that both mean the
same, as الصُّفَّةُ and الظُّلَّةُ are one in meaning.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  An appertenance of the سَرْج
[or horse's saddle]; (S, M, IAth, Mgh, O, K,
TA;) like the مِيثَرَة [q. v. in art. وثر] of the رَحْل
[or camel's saddle]; (IAth, L, TA; *) the thing
with which it is covered, between the قَرَبُوسَانِ,
which are its fore part and its hinder part:
(Mgh:) or, (M, TA,) as also of the رَحْل, (M,)
the thing that comprises within it (تَضُمُّ) the [two
pieces of wood called the] عَرْقُوَتَانِ and the [two pads,
or stuffed things, called the] بِدَادَانِ, above them and
beneath them: (M, TA:) pl. صُفَفٌ (S, M, O, K)
and صِفَافٌ, the latter mentioned by Sb. (M.) ―
-b3-
Also (tropical:)  A long period (زَمَانٌ) of time. (O, K,
TA.) So in the saying, عِشْنَا صُفَّةٌ مِنَ الدَّهْرِ (tropical:)  [We
lived, or have lived, a long period of time]. (O,
TA.) ―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  The quantity of grain that is put
upon the palm of the hand: occurring in a trad.
of Abu-d-Dardà, in the saying, أَصْبَحْتُ لَا أَمْلكُ
صُفَّةً وَلَا لُفَّةً [I became so that I possessed not the
quantity of grain that might be put on the palm
of the hand, nor a morsel of food]; اللُّفَّةُ meaning
اللُّقْمَةُ. (TA.)
صَفَفٌ A thing that a man wears beneath the
coat of mail (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K) in the day of
battle. (Ibn-'Abbád, O.)
صَفُوفٌ A she-camel that yields a row of bowls
of her milk (تَصُفُّ أَقْدَاحًا مِنْ لَبَنِهَا S, O, K) when
she is milked, (S, O,) because of the abundance of
her milk: (S, O, K:) or for which two vessels are
set side by side (يُصَفُّ), and which fills them:
(Ham p. 535:) or that sets her fore legs evenly,
side by side, (تَصُفُّ يَدَيْهَا, [see 1,]) on the occasion
of being milked. (S, M, O, K.) [See an ex. in a
verse cited voce صُوفٌ. And see also ضَفُوفٌ.]
صَفِيفٌ Flesh-meat (S, M) such as has been laid,
cut into a strip, or into strips, (صُفَّ, S, K, and
the like in the M and O, or شُرِحَ وَصُفَّ, Mgh,)
upon the live coals (S, Mgh, O, K) to broil (S,
Mgh, K) or to become thoroughly cooked, (O,) or
upon the pebbles, and then roasted, or broiled,
(M,) or in the sun, to dry: (O, K:) or flesh-meat cut into strips, or oblong pieces, and dried
in the sun, (M, * Mgh, Msb,) or, as Lth says, and
in like manner Ks, spread in the sun [to dry]:
(Mgh:) or flesh-meat cut into broad slices: (M:)
or, accord. to Khálid Ibn-Jembeh, flesh-meat cut
into slices, not in the manner of قَدِيد, but made
broad, like cakes of bread [which are generally
about a span, or somewhat less, in width, round
and flat]: (TA:) [or cut thin so as to be translucent: (see 1, latter half:)] or flesh-meat made
to boil once, and then taken up [from the fire].

called أَهْلُ الصُّفَّةِ. (TA. (See art. صوف.])

applied to camels [as meaning Setting their legs
in an even row], from صَفَّتْ قَوَائِمَهَا: (S, O:) [or]

[i. e. set in a row], (M, O, K, TA,) to be
slaughtered; (M, TA;) of the measure فَوَاعِل in
the sense of the measure مَفَاعِل [thus in the O, and
also (probably copied therefrom) in the copies of
the K; but correctly مَفَاعِيل]: or it means مُصْطَفَّةً
[i. e. standing in a row]: (O, K:) or, as related
by I 'Ab, it is صَوَافِنَ. (TA.) In the phrase
وَالصَّافَّاتِ صَفًّا in the Kur [xxxvii. 1], by الصَّافَّات
are meant The angels standing in ranks in
Heaven, glorifying God. (M, O, K.) ―
-b2-  Applied
to a bird, it means Expanding its wings and not
moving [or flapping] them [in its flight]: opposed
to دَافٌّ. (M and TA in art. دف.)
