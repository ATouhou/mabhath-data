صَبَعَ بِهِ, aor.
صَبَعَ, (AZ, S, K,) inf. n. صَبْعٌ,
(AZ, S,) He pointed at him, or towards him,
with his finger, (بِإِصْبَعِهِ,) disparagingly: (AZ, S,
K:) or, as some say, he meant some evil thing to
him when he (the latter) was inadvertent, not
knowing. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And صَبَعَ فُلَانًا عَلَى فُلَانٍ
He directed such a one to such a one by pointing,
or indication: (S, K:) because, when one directs
a man to a way, or road, or to a thing that is
latent, or obscure, he points towards it with the
finger. (TA.) One says, مَا صَبَعَكَ عَلَيْنَا What
directed thee to us? (TA.) And صَبَعَ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ
He directed others to the people, or party. (TA.)
Of one who magnifies himself, or acts proudly,
in his government, or administration, one says,
صَبَعَهُ الشَّيْطَانُ (assumed tropical:)  [app. meaning The Devil has
directed him]: and أَدْرَكَتْهُ أَصَابِعُ الشَّيْطَانِ [The
fingers of the Devil have reached him]. (TA.
[See the pass. part. n. below.]) ―

قُرِّبَ إِلَيْهِ طَعَامٌ فَمَا صَبَعَ فِيهِ i. e. [Food was presented, or offered, to him, or was placed, or put,
before him, and] he did not put his finger into it.

الدَّجَاجَةَ, (O, K,) inf. n. as above. (TA,) He
inserted his finger into the hen in order that he
might know if she were [near] laying an egg or not:

-b5-  And صَبَعَ
الإِنَآءَ He put his finger upon the vessel so that
what was in another vessel flowed upon it [into
the former vessel]: (A'Obeyd, S, O, K:) or, as
some say, he put together his two fingers, [or two
of his fingers,] then discharged, or let flow, what
was in the vessel, of wine, or beverage, into a
thing with a narrow head [or mouth]: or, accord.
to Az, he discharged, or let flow, what was in the
vessel, of wine, or beverage, between the extremities of [either of] his two thumbs and fore
fingers, in order that it might not become scattered, and pour forth copiously. (TA.) ―
-b6-  And
صَبَعَهُ, inf. n. as above, He hit, or hurt, his finger.
(TA.)
-A2-  صَبَعَ عَلَى القَوْمِ, inf. n. as above, meaning He came forth upon the people, or party, is
said to be originally صَبَأَ, with ء. (TA.)

اصبع, followed by عَلَى, is said by Freytag,
as on the authority of Meyd, to signify He (a
pastor) fed and managed well his cattle: but this
is perhaps taken from a mistranscription of the
saying, mentioned by Meyd, لِلرَّاعِى عَلَى مَاشِيَتَهِ
إِصْبَعٌ, q. v. infrà.]
صَبْعٌ (tropical:)  Self-magnification, or pride; (O, K,

vowelled, and the ب likewise (Msb, K) with
every one of the vowellings of the ء, (K,) and
↓ أُصْبُوعٌ also, (Msb, K,) of all which forms the
first is the [only] one commonly known and the
one approved by persons of chaste speech, (Msb,)
all mentioned by Kr, (K,) and by Lh also on the
authority of Yoo, (TA,) A finger: and a toe:

of their state or condition]. (IAar, TA.) ―

(tropical:)  [The heart of the believer is between two of the
fingers of God: He turneth it about as He
pleaseth]. (O.) ―
-b7-  And a man says, in respect of
a difficult affair, when he has been made to have
recourse to a strong man, able to bear his burden,
إِنَّهُ يَأْتِى عَلَيْهِ بِإِصْبِعٍ وَاحِدَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily he will make
an end of it with one finger]: and إِنَّهُ يَكْفِيهِ
بِصُغْرَى أَصَابِعِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily the smallest of his fingers
will suffice him for its accomplishment; the ب
thus prefixed to the agent being redundant, as in

without whiteness: (O, TA:) so says Ibn-Jezleh:
(TA:) it is beneficial as a remedy for madness, or
diabolical possession, and for poisons, (K, TA,)

reptiles, or the like, and it acts as a dissolvent
of thick excrescences. (TA.) ―
