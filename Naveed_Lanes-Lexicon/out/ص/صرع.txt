madness, or diabolical possession, (Msb,) accord.
to the Ra-ees [Ibn-Seenà, whom we call “ Avicenna ”], (TA,) preventing, but not completely,
the vital organs from performing their actions
[or functions]; the cause of which is an obstruction that occurs in one or more of the venters
(بُطُون) of the brain and in the ducts of the
أَعْصَاب [here meaning nerves] by which the
members are moved, [arising] from an abundant
thick or viscous خِلْط [or humour], whereby the
رُوح [by which is here meant, as in many other
instances, the vital spirit, or nervous fluid,] is
prevented from pervading them in the natural
manner, and consequently the members become
[spasmodically] contracted. (K, TA.)

water when the other returns from it, by reason
of their [the camels'] multitude. (S, O, K.) ―

And [hence, perhaps,] الصَّرْعَانِ signifies The
night and the day; (K;) [and] so ↓ الصِّرْعَانِ,
with kesr, like الصِّرْفَانِ: (TA in art. صرف:) or
the forenoon and the afternoon; from the first

or the morning, between daybreak and sunrise,

also العَصْرَانِ; (S and K in explanation of الأَبْرَدَانِ;)
and some assert that it is formed by transposition

the day. (A, TA.) And one says, أَتَيْتُهُ صَرْعَىِ

صَرْعَانِ رَائِحَةً عَقْلٌ وَتَقْيِيدُ
meaning As though I were one, i. e. a camel,
yearning towards his place of abode, which an
evening and a morning, in evening a binding of

from a settled abiding-place: or, as Aboo-'Alee
relates it, رَائِحَةٌ, [as a partial substitute for
صَرْعَانِ,] meaning, an evening, when there is a
binding of the fore shank to the arm, and a
morning, when there is a shackling of the legs;
for they bind the camel's fore shank to his arm
in the evening when he is lying down, and they
shackle his legs in the morning so that he may
pasture [but not stray]: another reading is صَرْعَاهُ
[his morning and evening]. (TA.) ―

such a one, an object of want, and then turned
away, and I know not in which of the two opposite conditions he was in respect of his affair, or
case]; i. e., his affair, or case, did not become
apparent, or clear, or known, to me. (S, O, K. *)
And a poet says,
فَرُحْتُ وَمَا وَدَّعْتُ لَيْلَى وَمَا دَرَتْ
عَلَى أَىِّ صِرْعَىْ أَمْرِهَا أَتَرَوَّحُ
[And I went, and bade not farewell to Leylà,
and she knew not in which of the two opposite
conditions in respect of her affair, or case, I was

هُوَ يَفْعَلُهُ فِى كُلِّ صِرْعَةٍ [He does it in every
state, or condition]: (O:) [see also صَرْعٌ:] or,
accord. to the “ Mufradát ” [of Er-Rághib], the
state, or condition, of him who is thrown down,
or prostrated. (TA.)
صُرْعَةٌ One who is often thrown down, or prostrated, by men. (K.)
صِرْعَةٌ A mode, or manner, of throwing down,
or prostrating; or of being thrown down, or
prostrated: (S, * K, TA:) a word similar to رِكْبَةٌ
and جِلْسَةٌ. (S.) Hence, (K,) one says, سُوْءُ
الاِسْتِمْسَاكِ خَيْرٌ مِنْ حُسْنِ الصِّرْعَةِ [The bad manner
of holding fast upon one's beast is better than the
good manner of being thrown down, or prostrated]: (S, K:) i. e., when one holds fast, though
he ride not well, it is better than one's being
thrown down, or prostrated, in a manner that
does not hurt him; because he who holds fast
sometimes overtakes, but he who is thrown down
will not attain: (TA:) a prov.: or, as some relate

of the single suffering of prostration. (K, * TA.
[See also Freytag's Arab. Prov. i. 623.])

teshdeed, mentioned by Ks: (O:) or ↓ صِرِّيعٌ
signifies one who throws down, or prostrates,
vehemently, though he be not well known for doing
so; as also ↓ صَرَّاعٌ and ↓ صَرِيعٌ, the latter like أَمِيرٌ
[in measure, but this I think doubtful, probably
added from finding صِرِّيعٌ mistranscribed]: or
↓ صِرِّيعٌ, accord. to the T, one whose occupation,
whereby he is known, is the throwing down, or
prostrating, others [as a wrestler]. (TA.) It is
said in a trad. that the Prophet asked, Whom do
ye reckon the صُرَعَة among you? they said,
Him whom men will not throw down: and he
said, He is not such, but is (assumed tropical:)  he who governs

to occur in a verse of Lebeed as pl. of the latter

sing. signifies a twig, or rod, that falls from the
tree called بَشَام [q. v.]; and the pl. is صُرْعَانٌ: the
former pl. occurs in a trad., in which it is said
that the Prophet was pleased to rub and clean his
teeth with صُرُع. (TA.) ―
-b8-  Also (tropical:)  A bow from
which nothing has been pared off: or of which

Aboo-Is-hák says, the مِصْرَاعَانِ are the two doors
