صمت1
صَمَتَ, (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb,) aor.
صَمُتَ, (S, M,
Msb,) inf. n. صَمْتٌ (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and
صُمْتٌ (M, L, TA) and صُمُوتٌ and صُمَاتٌ, (S, M,
Mgh, Msb, K,) or the first of these is the inf. n.
and the rest are simple substs.; (M;) and
↓ اصمت, (S, M, Msb,) inf. n. إِصْمَاتٌ; (K;) and
↓ صمّت, inf. n. تَصْمِيتٌ; (S, K; but only the
inf. n. is mentioned;) He was, or became, silent,
mute, or speechless; syn. سَكَتَ: (S, A, Msb, K:)
or he was, or became, long silent or mute or speechless: (M, Mgh:) but there is a difference between
سَكَتَ and صَمَتَ; for the former is said of him
who has the power, or faculty, of speech, but
abstains from making use of it; whereas the latter
is sometimes said of that which has not the power,
or faculty, of speech. (Er-Rághib, MF and TA
in art. سكت.) The Arabs say, (Ks, TA,) and it is
said in a trad., (TA,) لَا صَمْتَ يَوْمًا إِلَى اللَّيْلِ, or
يَوْمٌ, or يَوْمٍ, i. e. There shall be no keeping silence
a whole day [until night]. (Ks, K, TA. [In the
“ Jámi' es-Sagheer,” we find لا صُمَاتَ instead of
لا صَمْتَ: and El-Munáwee, in his Commentary
on that work, says that the keeping silence for a
whole day is forbidden by the words of this trad.
because it is an imitation of a Christian custom.])
And إِذْنُهَا صُمَاتُهَا [in another trad., relating to the
asking a virgin if she consent to be married, lit.
Her permission is her silence,] means her silence
is like her permission, i. e. it suffices. (Msb.)
One says also, جَآءَ بِمَا صَآءَ وَصَمَتَ (assumed tropical:)  [He brought
what was vocal and what was mute]; مَا صَآءَ
meaning sheep, or goats, and camels; and مَا صَمَتَ,
gold and silver: (IAar, TA:) صَآءَ in this saying is
formed by transposition from صَأَى [q. v.]. (S in
art. صأى.)
2
صمّتهُ, (M, A, K,) inf. n. تَصْمِيتٌ; (S;) and
↓ اصمتهُ; (M, A, Msb, K;) He made him, or
rendered him, silent, mute, or speechless: (S, A,
Msb, K:) or he made him, or rendered him, long
silent or mute or speechless. (M.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
صَمِّتِى صَبِيَّكِ Feed thy child with that which
will silence it [or quiet it]. (A, TA.) ―
-b3-  And
صمّت الرَّجُلَ He inclined to the man who complained to him by reason of his complaint [and so
quieted him; or he cared for the complaint of the
man and so quieted him; see مُصَمِّتٌ]. (M, TA.)

اصمتهُ: see 2. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] لَمْ يُصْمِتْهُ ذٰلِكَ
That did not suffice him [so as to quiet him]: said
only of what is eaten and drunk. (TA.) ―

اصمتهُ He made it to be solid, not hollow; without
a cavity. (A'Obeyd, S, K.) [For that which is
without a cavity is generally non-sonorous.] ―
-b4-
And أُصْمِتَتِ الأَرْضُ, or أَصْمَتَت, (accord. to different copies of the K, the latter accord. to the O,)
The land became altered (أَحَالَت) [so as to be
rugged, or hard, app. in consequence of its having
been left untilled and unsown,] at the end of two
years, (O, K,) and had rugged patches of urine
and dung. (O.)
-A2-  See also 1, first sentence. ―
-b2-
أَصْمَتَ also signifies He was, or became, tonguetied, (O, TA,) and spoke not; (TA;) said of a
sick man. (O, TA.)
صُمْتَةٌ a subst. from صَمَتَ [as such signifying
Silence, muteness, or speechlessness; like صَمْتٌ
used as a subst., and صُمْتٌ &c.; and like سُكْتَةٌ
and سِكْتَةٌ]. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-  And (M, TA) A thing,
(M, A, K, TA,) i. e. food, (A, K, TA,) or the
like, (K, TA,) such as a date, or something pretty,
(TA,) with which one silences [or quiets] (M, A,
K, TA) a child; (A, K, TA;) as also ↓ صِمْتَةٌ;
(Lh, M, TA;) like سُكْتَةٌ [in this sense as well as
in the former sense]. (S.) A date is called صُمْتَةُ
الصَّبِىِّ [The quieter of the child], (M, TA,) and
صُمْتَةُ الصَّغِيرِ [The quieter of the little one], so in
a trad., because when the little one cries, or weeps,
he is silenced with it. (TA.) One says, مَا عِنْدَهَا
صُمْتَةُ لَيْلَةٍ She has not as much as would silence
[or quiet] her child during one night. (A.) And

tasted,] anything. (K.)
رَمَاهُ بِصُمَاتِهِ, (AZ, K, A, K, [in a copy of the
M بصِمَاتِه, but this I think a mistranscription,])
or ↓ بِصُمَاتَةٍ, (K accord. to the TA, and so in the
M in art. سكت,) [both probably correct, for] one
says also بِسُكَاتِهِ (AZ, S) and بِسُكَاتَةٍ, (S, M, A, K,
in art. سكت,) He (a man, AZ, S, or God, A)

صِمَاتِ أَمْرِهِ He passed the night resolved upon his
affair. (TA.) And هُوَ بِصِمَاتِهِ He is at the point
of [attaining] his purpose: (M, TA:) Aboo-Málik says that صِمَاتٌ signifies قَصْدٌ [i. e. purpose,

woman, having thick legs, form whose pair of
anklets no sound is heard to proceed, (K, TA,)
by reason of their being depressed in her legs.

And سَيْفٌ صَمُوتٌ (assumed tropical:)  A sword that penetrates deeply
into the thing struck with it [so as not to make a
sound by its being repelled by a bone]. (K, TA.)
And ضَرْبَةٌ صَمُوتٌ (assumed tropical:)  A blow [with a sword or the

صِمِّيتٌ, applied to a man, (S,) i. q. سِكِّيتٌ, (S,
K, TA,) [i. e. Much, or often, silent or mute or
speechless; or] long silent &c. (TA.)
صَامِتٌ Silent, mute, or speechless: (Msb:) pl.
صَامِتُونَ (Kur vii. 192) [and صُمُوتٌ, occurring in
the K in art. زم]. [Hence,] one says, مَا لَهُ صَامِتٌ
وَلَا نَاطِقٌ (tropical:)  [He has not mute nor vocal property;
or he has not dead nor live stock]: (S, M, A:) by
the former are meant gold and silver; (S, M,
Msb, K;) and by the latter, camels, (S, K,) and
sheep or goats, (S,) or animals: (M:) i. e. he has
not aught. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also, of camels, (assumed tropical:)  Twenty,
(O, K,) and the like. (O.) ―
-b3-  And of milk,
(assumed tropical:)  Such as is thick. (S, O, K.)
أَصْمَتُ: see مُصْمِتٌ.
لَقِيتُهُ بِوَحْشِ إِصْمِتَ and بِبَلْدَةِ إِصْمِتَ AZ explains as meaning [I met him, or met with him,
or found him,] in a desert place, in which was no
one to cheer by his company: (S: [and in like
manner the latter phrase is expl. in the M:])
accord. to Kr, بِبَلْدَةٍ إِصْمِتَ; but the phrase
commonly known is بِبَلْدَةِ إِصْمِتَ: (M:) or
تَرَكْتُهُ بِبَلْدَةِ إِصْمِتَ [I left him] in the desert, or
waterless desert: or in such a place that it was
not known where he was: (K:) and بِصَحْرَآءِ إِصْمِتَ
(M, K) meaning as above, (K,) or having the
latter of these two meanings: (M:) and بِوَحْشِ
إِصْمِتَ and ↓ إِصْمِتَةَ, (M, K,) mentioned, but not
expl., by Lh, (M,) meaning as above, (K,) or
app. meaning in the desert, or waterless desert:
(M:) and some say, بِوَحْشِ الإِصْمِتَيْنِ: (TA:)
اصمت is as above, with the disjunctive alif; and
also with the conjunctive [i. e. اصْمِتَ]: (O, K:)
it is imperfectly decl., (S, MF, TA,) because combining the quality of a proper name with the fem.
gender or with the measure of a verb: (MF,
TA:) it is said that the desert, or waterless desert,
is thus called because in it one fears much; as
though everyone [therein] said to his companion,
اصمت [i. e. اُصْمُتْ or أَصْمِتْ, “Be thou silent ”];
like as they say of a مَهْمَه that it is so called
because a man [therein] says to his companion,
مَهْ مَهْ: (MA:) [for] accord. to some the word
إِصْمِت is an imperative changed into a subst., and
hence the ء is disjunctive, and it may be with kesr
accord. to a dial. var. [of the imperative] that has
not reached us: accord. to Yákoot, it is the name
of a particular desert; but others say that the
proper name [of that desert] is وَحْشُ إِصْمِتَ.
(TA in art. وحش.)
إِصْمِتَة: see the next preceding paragraph.
مُضْمَتٌ [primarily signifies Made, or rendered,
silent, mute, or speechless. ―

وَمِنْ دُونِ لَيْلَى مُصْمَتَاتُ المَقَاصِرِ
[And in the way to Leylà are what are closed,
&c., of chambers to which the owner alone has
access: مَقَاصِر being used by poetic license for
مَقَاصَير, pl. of مَقْصُورَةٌ]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Also A garment, or piece of cloth, of one, unmixed, colour.
(M, Mgh, K.) The garment thus termed that is
disliked is That of which the warp and woof are
both of silk: or such as is woven of undressed silk,
and then dressed, and dyed of one colour:
(Mgh:) [or] such as is termed مُصْمَتٌ مِنْ خَزٍّ,
i. e. consisting entirely of silk, not mixed with
cotton nor with other material, was forbidden by
the Prophet. (TA.) ―

-b7-  The فَهْد
[or lynx, an animal proverbial for much sleeping,]
is said to be مُصْمتُ النَّوْمِ (tropical:)  [app. meaning A
heavy sleeper]. (A, TA.) ―
-b8-  الحُرُوفُ المُصْمَتَةُ are
All the letters [of the Arabic alphabet] except
those called حُرُوفُ الذَّلَاقَةِ [or الحُرُوفُ الذُّلْقُ];
(M, TA;) i. e. (TA) all the letters except those
comprised in the phrase مُرْ بِنَفْلٍ. (K, TA.)
[What is here rendered “ except ” (i. e. مَا عَدَا) is
said by MF to be omitted in most of the copies of
the K.] ―
-b9-  See also مُصَمَّتْ.

art. بهم. [In one of the explanations which I have
given of مُبْهَمٌ in consequence of an omission (to
be supplied in Book II.), أَصْمَتُ is made syn.
with مُصْمَتٌ.])
أَلْفٌ مُصَمَّتٌ (assumed tropical:)  A thousand completed; (M, K;)
like مُصَتَّمٌ; (M;) as also ↓ مُصْمَتٌ. (K.)
مُصَمِّتٌ [A silencer, or quieter: and hence, ―
-b2- ]
One who cares for another's complaint. (M, *
Meyd, TA.) One says, (M, Meyd, TA,) i. e. a
rájiz says, addressing a camel belonging to him,
(Har p. 642,)
إِنَّكَ لَا تَشْكُو إِلَى مُصَمِّتِ
فَاصْبِرْ عَلَى الحِمْلِ الثَّقِيلِ أَوْ مُتِ
[Verily thou complainest not to one who cares for
thy complaint; therefore endure with patience
the bearing of the heavy burden, or die]. (M,
Meyd, TA.) تَشْكُو إِلَى غَيْرِ مُصَمِّتٍ, i. e. [Thou
complainest] to one who cares not for thy case, is
a proverb. (Meyd.)
