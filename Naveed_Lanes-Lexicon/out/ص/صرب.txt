الصَّبِىِّ لِيَسْمَنَ, to which, written without the syll.
signs, the TA assigns the last of the meanings
above; therefore, I doubt not, the right reading is
بَطْنُ, agreeably with the explanation of صَرَبَ
بَطْنُ الصَّبِىِّ in the M, given above: otherwise, the
meaning must be (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, caused the boy's

Q. Q. 4
اِصْرَأَبَّ: see what next precedes.
صَرْبٌ and ↓ صَرَبٌ (S, M, &c.) Sour milk (M,
Mgh, K) that has been collected in a skin: (M,
K:) or very sour milk: (S, Msb:) or milk that
has been collected in a skin for some days so that
it has become very sour: (As, M:) n. un. ↓ صَرْبَةٌ
and ↓ صَرَبَةٌ: (M, TA:) صِرَابٌ, occurring in some
of the Expositions of the Jámi' es-Sagheer, is a
mistranscription; or it may be a pl. of صَرْبٌ
accord. to the analogy of حَبْلٌ and حِبَالٌ, and رَمْلٌ
and رِمَالٌ. (Mgh.) One says, تَزْوِى ↓ جَآءَنَا بَصَرْبَةٍ
الوَجْهَ [He brought us some sour milk, or very sour
milk, that had been collected in a skin, making
the face to contract in wrinkles]. (S.) [SM here
adds,] Az says that الصَّرْمُ is like الصَّرْبُ, and is
better known. (TA. [But this evidently relates
to the signification of “ the act of cutting,” or
“ cutting off; ” not to الصَّرْبُ as applied to milk.])
―
-b2-  Also, (K,) or the former word, (M,) Milk
that is provided in a skin for a journey, (M, K,)
whether fresh or sour. (M.) ―
-b3-  And both words,
(M, K, TA,) or ↓ صَرَبٌ [only], (S, Msb,) Gum:
(Msb:) or red gum: (T, S, M, L, TA: in the K,
الصِّبْغُ الأَحْمَرُ is erroneously put for الصَّمْغُ
الأَحْمَرُ: TA:) some say (M) it is the gum of the
طَلْح (S, M) and of the عُرْفُط, peculiarly; the
pieces of which are red, as though they were ingots
[of gold], and they are broken with stones: (M:)
the n. un. is ↓ صَرَبَةٌ: (S, M: [صَرْبَةٌ as a n. un. in
this sense I do not find mentioned:]) and sometimes it [i. e. صَرْبٌ or صَرَبٌ] has صِرَابٌ for pl.:
(M:) sometimes, (S,) what is called ↓ صَرَبَةٌ is a
thing like the head of the cat [in size], within
which is a thing [or substance] like دِبْس [or honey
of dates], (S, K,) and like glue, (S,) which is
sucked and eaten. (S, K.)
صِرْبٌ A few tents (بُيُوت [in the O, erroneously,
بُتُوت]) of the weak sort of the Arabs of the desert:
(IAar, O, * K, TA:) and so صِرْمٌ. (O.)
صَرَبٌ: see صَرْبٌ, in two places. ―
-b2-  Also Red
honey. (TA in art. ضرب.) ―
-b3-  See also صَرَبَةٌ.
صَرْبَةٌ: see صَرْبٌ, in two places. ―
-b2-  Hence,
(tropical:)  The water [by which is meant the seminal fluid]
that collects in the back [of a man]; as being
likened to the [sour] milk that is collected in a
skin. (M, TA.)
صَرَبَةٌ: see صَرْبٌ, in three places. ―
-b2-  Also A
herb, (M, K,) and tree, (M,) that becomes green,
and puts forth leaves, when dry, or that has
grown, or become somewhat restored to a good
state, after having been eaten [or depastured],
(يَتَجَبَّرُ, so in the M, [in the K يَتَخَيَّرُ, which, as
is remarked in the TK, is a mistake,]) after men
[have fed their cattle therefrom]: pl. [or rather
coll. gen. n.] ↓ صَرَبٌ. (M.)
صَرْبَى, (S, K,) accord. to Sa'eed Ibn-El-Museiyib, (TA,) The [she-camel called] بَحِيرَة, (S,
K,) whose milk was forbidden [by the pagan
Arabs] for the sake of the idols (الطَّوَاغِيت), no
man milking her [for himself]: (TA:) thus
called, (S, K, TA,) it is said, (TA,) because they
used not to milk her save for the guest, so that
her milk became collected [and retained] (S, K,
TA) in her udder: (S, TA:) Kt says, it is from
صَرَبْتُ اللَّبَنَ فِى الضَّرْعِ [expl. above]; or, as some
say, from [الصَّرْبُ as signifying] “ the act of cutting,” or “ cutting off; ” and this seems to be the
more correct of the two explanations: accord. to
IAar, it signifies a she-camel having the ear slit,
like the بَحِيرَة, or cut off: and its pl., he says, is
صُرْبٌ. (TA.)
صِرَابٌ See-produce, or corn, which has been
sown after that which has been carried off to the
place where it is trodden in the autumn. (O, K.)
صَرِيبٌ Milk that has been made what is termed
صَرْب; as also ↓ مَصْرُوبٌ: (M, TA:) or sour milk:
(A, K, TA:) pl. صُرْبٌ. (K.) So in the saying
الضَّرِيبَ لَا الصَّرِيبَ, i. e. [Give me] the thick [milk],
from a number of milch camels, that has been
mixed together; not the sour. (A, TA.)
صَرَابَةٌ Clearness, and smoothness: thus in the
phrase صَرَابَةُ حَنْظَلٍ in a verse of Imra-el-Keys;
as some relate it: (M, TA:) as others relate it,
صَرَايَة, (M,) or صَلَايَة. (TA.)
مِصْرَبٌ A vessel in which milk is collected,
portion after portion, and left to become sour:
(S, K: *) and so مِكْرَصٌ and مِقْرَعٌ: pl. مَصَارِبُ.
(TA.)
مَصْرُوبٌ: see صَرِيبٌ.
مُصَرَّبَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A she-camel that is kept from being
milked, in order that she may become fat. (L in
art. صفح, from the T.)
