or of عِظَمٌ, as also صَغَارَةٌ [&c.]: (M, K:) or صِغَرٌ

(a form used in poetry, S,) and ↓ مَصْغُوَرآءُ, (S, K,)
or the last is [correctly speaking] a quasi-pl. n.:
(TA:) and pl. fem. صِغَارٌ, but not صَغَائِرُ when used
as an epithet: (Msb:) the dim. of صَغِيرٌ is ↓ صُغَيِّرٌ

(Sb, S, K) and أَصَاغِرَةٌ, (M, K,) though the sing.
is not of the nouns which regularly add ة to the
pl., and it is added in this case because the sing.
resembles in form قَشْعَمٌ, of which قَشَاعِمَةٌ is a pl.,
(ISd,) and أَصْغَرُونَ: (Sb, S:) and pl. fem. صُغَرٌ (Sb,

or of one of his lips; thus correctly, as in the M

(TA.) You say, صَغَتْ إِلَيْهِ أُذُنُهُ His ear inclined to him, or it. (TA.) And hence, in the
Kur [lxvi. 4], فَقَدْ صَغَتْ قُلُوبُكُمَا [For the hearts

إِنَآءَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [I. q. اصغى حَقَّهُ expl. in what follows:
(see also مُصْغًى:) or] he detracted from his reputation; spoke evil of him; or slandered him. (Z,
TA.) اصغى حَقَّهُ, (A, TA,) or الشَّىْءَ, (K,) means

agreeable with thine]. (AZ, S, K.) In [some of]
the copies of the K صَغْوُهُ and صِغْوُهُ are written
صَغْوَةٌ and صِغْوَةٌ, which would lead the inadvertent to imagine these two words to be syn.
with the word there next preceding, namely,
صَغْوَآءُ as an epithet applied to the sun. (TA.)
صَغْوٌ: see the next preceding paragraph. [هٰذَا
