صنو4
اصنى النَّخْلُ The palm-trees had pairs, or
triplets, or more, growing together from single
roots. (IKtt, TA.)
صَنْوٌ: see the next paragraph.
صُنْوٌ: see the next paragraph.
صِنْوٌ One of a pair, (AHn, S, M, K,) or of three,
(S, M,) or of more than two, (K,) or of more than
three, (M,) or of five, or of six, (TA,) of palmtrees, (S, M, K,) or of any trees, (AHn, M, K,) or of
trees resembling one another, (M,) growing from
one root; (AHn, S, M, K;) each [or every one] of
such being called the صِنْو of the other [or others
growing with it]; (AHn, M;) as also ↓ صُنْوٌ, (M,
K,) mentioned by Zj: (M:) two of such are
termed صِنْوَانِ (S, K) and صُنْوَانِ and صَنْوَانِ,
[which last implies that ↓ صَنْوٌ as well as صُنْوٌ is a
dial. var. of صِنْوٌ,] and also صِنْيَانِ and صُنْيَانِ and
صَنْيَانِ, [which imply that صِنْىٌ and صُنْىٌ and
صَنْىٌ are also dial. vars. of صِنْوٌ and صُنْوٌ and صَنْوٌ;]
(K;) and the pl. is صِنْوَانٌ (AZ, S, M) and [of
pauc.] أَصْنَآءٌ, (M,) the former pl. differing from
the first of the duals mentioned above by being
perfectly decl. (AZ, S, * TA.) Hence, in the Kur
[xiii. 4], صِنْوَانٍ وَغَيْرُِ صِنْوَانٍ, (TA,) i. e. Palmtrees having one root and [others] having distinct
roots: Hafs read صُنْوَان, like قُنْوَان pl. of قِنْوٌ; of
the dial. of Temeem. (Bd.) ―
-b2-  And hence, (TA,)
(assumed tropical:)  A brother; but not so called unless coupled
with another: (Sh, TA:) or a brother by the same
father: (Az, TA:) [or a brother by the same
mother; as is indicated by an explanation of one
of the pls in what follows:] or a brother such as
is termed شقِيق, (M, K,) which means by the
father and mother: (TA in art. شق:) and a
son; (M, K;) because he has branched forth
from one stock [with his father]: (TA:) and a
paternal uncle; (M, K;) but this last meaning is
taken from a trad. cited in what follows: (TA:)
the fem. is with ة: and the pl. is أَصْنَآءٌ [a pl. of
pauc.] and صِنْوَانٌ [as above]. (M, K.) It is said
in a trad., عَمُّ الرَّجُلِ صِنْوُ أَبِيهِ (tropical:)  [The paternal
uncle of the man is the صِنْو of his father]; (T, S;)
meaning that the stock of both is one. (T, TA.)
[And it is said that] صَنْوَانٌ وغَيْرُ صِنْوَانٍ, relating
to a man's children, means (assumed tropical:)  Sons of one mother
by different fathers, and children of different
mothers by one father. (Har p. 608.) ―
-b3-  [Hence
the pl.] أَصْنَآءٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  Likes, or fellows.
(IAar, TA.) ―
-b4-  And رَكِيَّتَانِ صِنْوَانِ (tropical:)  Two wells
near together, (AZ, S, M, K, TA,) or (so in the
TA and in some copies of the K) that yield water
from one spring. (AZ, S, K, TA.) ―
-b5-  صِنْوٌ also
signifies A widened well (حَفَرٌ) from which water
is not drawn and of the water of which no use is
made: (Ibn-Buzurj, K:) pl. صِنْوَانٌ. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA.) ―
-b6-  See also what follows.
صُنَىٌّ A small حِسْى [q. v.] to which no one
comes for water, (S, K,) and for which no one
cares: dim. of ↓ صِنْوٌ: (S:) or, as some say, (S,)
a cleft in a mountain: (S, TA:) or a ravine, or
gap, (شِعْبٌ,) in which water flows, between two
mountains. (TA.)
