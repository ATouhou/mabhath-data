صحر1
صَحَرَهُ, aor.
صَحَرَ, (S, K,) inf. n. صَحْرٌ, (S, TA,)
namely, milk, He made it to become what is
termed صَحِيرَة: (S, TA:) or he cooked it, (K,
TA,) and then gave it to a sick person to drink.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  صَحَرَتْهُ الشَّمْسُ The sun pained his
brain: (K:) it is like صَهَرَتْهُ; (A;) or, as some
say, melted him. (TA.)
-A2-  صَحَرَ, aor.
صَحَرَ, inf. n.
صَحِيرٌ and صُحَارٌ, He (an ass) uttered a sound
[or braying] more vehement than the neighing of
horses. (TA.)
-A3-  [Golius explains صَحَرَ as meaning It spread out wide, said of a place, on the
authority of J: but the verb is اصحر, q. v.; and
the authority is not J.]

صَاْحَرَ [صِحَارٌ is an inf. n. of صَاحَرَ, a verb not
mentioned: hence,] أَبْرَزَ لَهُ مَا فِى نَفْسِهِ مِنَ الأَمْرِ
صِحَارَا (assumed tropical:)  [He showed to him what was in his
mind, of the thing, or affair, openly]: a saying
like جَاهَرَهُ بِهِ جِهَارًا. (K, * TA. [See also 4.])

اصحر, (S, A, Mgh, K,) or اصحر الصَّحْرَآءَ,
(Msb, [but I think that this is a mistake for
اصحر إِلَى الصَّحْرَآءِ,]) inf. n. إِصْحَارٌ, (Msb,) He
went forth to the صحرآء [or desert, &c.], (S, A,
Mgh,) or into the صحرآء: (Msb, K:) تصحّر [in
this sense] has not been heard. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-
Hence, in a trad., the saying of Umm-Selemeh to
'Áïsheh, سَكَّنَ اللّٰهُ عُقَيْرَاكِ فَلَا تُصْحِرِيهَا [app.
meaning, accord. to explanations of it in the TA
in art. عقر, God hath made thy dwelling and
estate, or, as Z explains it, thy person (نَفْسَكِ), to
be quietly settled, therefore do not thou remove it
forth to the desert]; i. e. لَا تُبْرِزِيهَا إِلَى الصَّحْرَآءِ;
the verb, accord. to IAth, being made trans. by
the suppression of the prep.; [i. e. تُصْحِرِيهَا being
for تُصْحِرِى بِهَا;] for it is [properly] intrans.
(TA. [See also the next sentence but one, in
which the verb is tropically made trans.]) ―
-b3-
أَصْحِرْ لِعَدُوِّكَ means (assumed tropical:)  Be thou in a state of clearness [or certainty] with respect to the case of thy
enemy: (JM, TA:) occurring in a trad. of 'Alee.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  One says also, أَصْحَرَ بِالأَمْرِ and أَصْحَرَهُ
(tropical:)  He revealed, or made manifest, the affair, or
case: and لَا تُصْحِرْ أَمْرَكَ (tropical:)  [Reveal not thy affair,
or case]: and أَصْحِرْهُ بِمَا فِى قَلْبِكَ (tropical:)  [Reveal to
him what is in thy mind]. (A, TA.) ―
-b5-  اصحر
said of a place, It was, or became, wide, or
spacious; (O, K, TA;) i. e. it became like the
صَحْرَآء. (TA.)
-A2-  Said of a man, He was, or
became, blind of one eye. (K.)
11
اصحارّ It (a plant) dried up; or became
yellow; or dried up and became yellow: (S:) or
became of a dingy red colour, and then dried up
and became yellow: (TA:) and (TA) it (a plant,
K, or an ear of corn, TA) became red: or its first
parts became white. (K, TA.)
صِحْرٌ an imitative sequent to صِفْرٌ [q. v.]. (Kh,
Ham p. 354.)
صَحَرٌ: see صُحْرَةٌ.
لَقِيتُةُ صَحْرَةَ بَحْرَةَ, in which the two nouns are
imperfectly decl., (S, L,) being regarded as one,
(L,) and صَحْرَةً بَحْرَةً, (K in art. بحر,) and
بُحْرَةَ ↓ صُحْرَةَ, with damm, (O,) and صُحْرَةً بُحْرَةً,
(MF in art. بحر,) and صَحْرَةً بَحْرَةً نَحْرَةً, (O, K,)
and صَحْرَةَ بَحْرَةَ نَحْرَةَ, (K, [but this last is implicitly disallowed in the O, and expressly by
MF in art. بحر,]) and with damm also in all
these words, [i. e. صُحْرَة &c.,] (K,) I met him
openly, or in open view, nothing intervening to
conceal him. (S, L, K. [See also بَحْرَةٌ; and see
صَرْحَةٌ.]) And one says likewise, أَخْبَرَهُ بِالأَمْرِ
صحرة بحرة [He acquainted him with the affair,
or case, openly]. (TA.)
صُحْرَةٌ (S, K, in the CK, صُحَرَةٌ [which is a
mistake,]) and ↓ صَحَرٌ (K [in some copies of the
K صَحْرٌ, which, as observed in the TA, is wrong,])
A colour in which is [the kind of red termed]
شُقْرَةٌ: (S:) or a colour nearly the same as [the
kind of red termed] صُبْهَةٌ: (K:) or the latter,
(TA, [and app. the former also,]) a dust-colour
with a slight redness, (in the K, in حُمْرَة خَفِيَّة,
the latter of these two words is a mistake for
خَفِيفَة, TA,) inclining to a little whiteness: (K,
TA:) or the former, redness inclining to dustcolour: (TA:) or dust-colour with redness: (A:)
and [redness of the kind termed] شُقْرَة in the
head: (As, TA:) and both words, a colour in
which is whiteness and redness: (TA:) and
whiteness overspreading blackness; like سُحْرَةٌ and
سَحَرٌ: (TA in art. سحر:) and the latter, accord.
to Sgh, whiteness. (TA.)
-A2-  Also, both words,
The quality of a صَحْرَآء [q. v.]. (ISh.) ―
-b2-  And
the former, A clear space in a [stony tract such
as is called] حَرَّة, (S, K,) consisting of soft and
clean soil with stones in it: (TA:) pl. صُحَرٌ; (S,
K;) the only pl. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See also صَحْرَة.
صَحْرَآءُ, imperfectly decl., (S, K,) though not
an epithet; (S;) or it is an epithet in which the
quality of a subst. predominates; (TA;) and is
imperfectly decl. because it is of the fem. gender,
(S,) and because the letter characteristic of the
fem. gender [namely the long ا] is inseparable
from it, (S, K,) A desert; a waste; syn. بَرِّيَّةٌ:
(S, Msb:) or a tract of land like the back of a
beast, bare, or destitute of herbage, without trees
and without hills and without mountains; smooth
[throughout]: (ISh:) or a plain, or level tract of
land, with smoothness and ruggedness, (A, K,)
less [rugged] than what is termed قُفّ: (K:) or a
spacious tract of ground in which is no herbage:
(M, A, K:) or the most plain and even of land,
whether it have produced herbage or not, not
having any mountain or hill near it; as also
جَهَادٌ: (ISh, TA in art. جهد:) you say صَحْرَآءُ
وَاسِعَةٌ [a wide desert &c.]; (S;) but you do not
say صَحْرَآءَةٌ, adding one fem. sign after another:
(S, Msb:) the pls. are صَحَارِىُّ (S, Msb, K) and
صَحَارٍ (S, M, Msb) [in the K, صَحَارِى, which,
without the art. ال, and except when it is prefixed to another noun, and in a case of pausing,
is a manifest mistake, as is shown in every complete treatise on inflection,] and صَحَارَى (S, Msb,
K) and صَحْرَاوَاتٌ: (S, K:) the first of which
four pls. occurs in poetry, and is the original
form of the second: for when you form the pl. of
صَحْرَآءُ, [which is originally صَحْرَاا,] you introduce
an ا between the ح and the ر, and give kesr to the
ر as in all similar cases: then the first ا which is
after the ر [in صحراا] is changed into ى, because
of the kesreh preceding it; and the second ا,
which is the characteristic of the fem. gender, is
also changed into ى, and incorporated into the
former: then they reject the first ى, and change
the second into ا, [though still writing it ى,] and
say صَحَارَى, with fet-h to the ر, that the ا may
not be elided in the case of tenween, [which the
word would have if the ر were with kesr]; and
this they do to distinguish between the ى that is
changed from the ا which is a characteristic of the
fem. gender and the ى that is changed from the
ا which is not a characteristic of the fem. gender
as the ا of مَرْمًى when they say مَرَامٍ: some of the
Arabs, however, do not reject the first ى [in
صَحَارِىُّ], but reject the second ى, and say
الصَّحَارِى, with kesr to the ر, and هٰذِهِ صَحَارٍ, like
as you say جَوَارٍ (S. [In the Ham, p. 54, صُحَرٌ
is mentioned as a pl. of صَحْرَآءُ; but I think it
doubtful.])
صُحَارٌ The sweat of horses: (O, K:) or the
fever of horses. (K.) [―
-b2-  See also 1.]
صَحُورٌ: see أَصْحَرُ.
صَحِيرٌ A certain uttering of the voice of the
ass, (A, K,) of a vehement kind, (A,) more
vehement than the neighing of horses: an inf. n.
(TA. [See 1.])
صَحِيرَةٌ Milk into which heated stones are
thrown, so that it boils, after which some clarified
butter is poured upon it, and it is drunk; and
sometimes some flour is sprinkled upon it, and
then it is supped: or, accord. to Abu-l-Gheyth, it
is called صَخِيرَةٌ, from الصَّخْرُ; like فَهِيرَةٌ, from
الفِهْرُ: (S:) or fresh milk into which heated stones
are thrown, or which is put in the cooking-pot
and made to boil in it once, until it burns; and
sometimes flour is put into it, and sometimes
clarified butter: (TA:) or fresh milk which is
made to boil, after which some clarified butter is
poured upon it, (K,) and it is drunk: (TA:) or
fresh milk which is heated until it burns: (A:)
or pure milk of camels, or of sheep, or of goats,
which, when they want soup, and have not flour,
it not being found in their land, they cook, and
then give to drink to a sick person, hot. (TA.)
ثَوْبٌ صُحَارِىٌّ A kind of garment, so called in
relation to صُحَار, a town of El-Yemen: or, as
some say, of the colour termed صُحْرَة, like ↓ أَصْحَرُ.
(TA, from a trad.)
صُحَيْرَآءُ A certain sort of milk: (K:) so says
Kr, without particularizing it. (TA.)
أَصْحَرُ Of the colour termed صُحْرَة: (S, K:) or
similar to أَصْبَحٌ: (As:) a man of a red colour
inclining to dust-colour: (TA:) or having a
colour such as is termed شُقْرَة upon his head:
(As:) and an ass in which is a red colour: (S:)
or of a dust-colour with redness: (A:) or in
which is whiteness and redness; (TA;) and so
↓ صَحُورٌ applied to a she-ass; or this signifies
wont to kick with her hind leg: (K, TA:) fem.
صَحْرَآءُ: (S, TA:) and pl. صُحْرٌ. (TA.) See also
صُحَارِىٌّ. ―
-b2-  الأَصْحَرُ and ↓ المُصْحِرُ The lion. (Sgh,
K.)
المُصْحِرُ: see what next precedes.
مُصَاحِرٌ One who fights with his adversary in
the desert (الصَّحْرَآء), and does not act deceitfully
with him. (S.)
