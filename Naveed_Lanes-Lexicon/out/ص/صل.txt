sound], as also ↓ صَلْصَلَ; (TA;) of a nail &c.,

flesh-meat that is chewed], which indicates that it
is used in relation to that which is cooked and
roasted; or, accord. to some, the verb here means
أَثْقَلَت [which has rendered heavy the eater]:
(M:) and one says also اللِّحَامُ ↓ صَلَّلَتِ [the
flesh-meats were, or became stinking (in both of
my copies of the S اللِّجَامُ is erroneously put for
اللِّحَامُ, the reading in other copies of the S and in

teshdeed لِلْكَثْرَةِ [i. e. because of its relation to
many subjects, or to a pl.]. (S, O.) In the Kur
[xxxii. 9], some read أَإِذَا صَلَلْنَا فِى الْأَرْضِ, (M,
O, TA,) [instead of the common reading, which
is ضَلَلْنَا, with ض,] and some read صَلِلْنَا, (O,

in ourselves and in our forms? and when we shall
have become dried up? from صَلَّةٌ meaning “ dry
ground. ” (TA.) ―

of skin such as is termed صَلَّة to the boot, app., to
its sole (see صَلَّةٌ): or, as is indicated by what
immediately precedes in the TA, he put a lining
(termed صَلَالَة) to the boot: the verb without
teshdeed (written in the O صَللْتُ) I think to be
a mistranscription, notwithstanding the inf. n.
assigned to it in the TA: general analogy is in
favour of its being with teshdeed; and it is said
that] تَصْلِيلٌ signifies The putting skin upon a
thing. (KL.)

خُفٌّ جَيِّدُ الصَّلَّةِ means [A boot good] in respect
of the sole; which is thus called by the name of
