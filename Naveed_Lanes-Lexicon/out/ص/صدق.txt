صدق1
صَدَقَ, (S, M, O, Msb, K,) aor.
صَدُقَ, (M, TA,)
inf. n. صِدْقٌ (S, * M, O, * Msb, K, TA) and صَدْقٌ,
(M, K,) the former of which is the more chaste,
(TA,) or the latter is an inf. n. and the former is
a simple subst., (K,) and تَصْدَاقٌ (M) and مَصْدُوقَةٌ,
(O, K, TA,) which is one of the [few] inf. ns. of
the measure مَفْعُولَةٌ, (O, TA,) [or a fem. pass.
part. n. used as an inf. n. like as is said of its contr.
مَكْذُوبَةٌ,] he spoke, said, uttered, or told, truth,
or truly, or veraciously; contr. of كَذَبَ: (Msb:
[and in like manner it is said in the S and M and
O and K that صِدْقٌ is the contr. of كَذِبٌ:]) Er-Rághib says that صِدْقٌ and كَذِبٌ are primarily
in what is said, whether relating to the past or to
the future, and [in the latter case] whether it be a
promise or other than a promise; and only in
what is said in the way of information: but sometimes they are in other modes of speech, such as
asking a question, and commanding, and supplicating; as when one says, “Is Zeyd in the
house? ” for this implies information of his being
ignorant of the state of Zeyd; and when one says,
“ Make me to share with thee, or to be equal with
thee,” for this implies his requiring to be made to
share with the other, or to be made equal with
him; and when one says, “Do not thou hurt
me,” for this implies that the other is hurting
him: صِدْقٌ, he says, is [by implication] the
agreeing of what is said with what is conceived in
the mind and with the thing told of, together;
otherwise it is not complete صِدْق, but may be
described either as صِدْق or sometimes as صِدْق and
sometimes as كَذِب according to two different
points of view; as when one says without believing it, “Mohammad is the Apostle of God,”
for this may be termed صِدْق because what is told
is such, and it may be termed كَذِب because it
is at variance with what the speaker conceives in
his mind. (TA.) One says, صَدَقَ فِى الحَدِيثِ
[He spoke truth in the information, or narration].
(S, O, K.) And صَدَقَهُ i. e. He told him, or informed him, with truth, or veracity, (AHeyth, *
M, Msb, *) فِى القَوْلِ [in the saying]; for it is
trans. as well as intrans. (Msb.) And صَدَقَهُ
الحَدِيثَ (S, O, K, in the CK [erroneously] صَدَّقَ
فُلانًا الحَدِيثَ) He told him with truth, or veracity,
the information, or narration; for it is sometimes
doubly trans. (TA.) And صَدَقَنِى سِنَّ بَكْرِهِ [He
hath told me truly the age, or as to the age, of his
youthful camel; or صَدَقَنِى سِنُّ بَكْرِهِ the age of
his youthful camel has spoken truly to me]: (S,
O, K:) a prov., (S, O,) expl. in art. بكر [q. v.].
(K.) And فُلَانٌ لَا يَصْدُقُ أَثَرُهُ and أَثَرَهُ, meaning
Such a one, when asked, will not tell truly whence
he comes. (M.) And صَدَقَتْ يَمِينُهُ His oath was,
or proved, true. (Msb in art. بت.) صَدَقْتُ اللّٰهَ
حَدِيثًا إِنْ لَمْ أَفْعَلْ كَذَا is an oath of the Arabs,
meaning لَا صَدَقْتُ الخ [May I not utter truly to
God a saying, i. e. may I not speak truth to God,
if I do not such a thing]. (AHeyth, O, K.) One
says also, صَدَقَهُ النَّصِيحَةَ, and الإِخَآءَ, He rendered
to him truly, or sincerely, good advice, and
brotherly affection. (M.) And صَدَ قُوهُمُ القِتَالَ
(S, M, K, * TA) [They gave them battle earnestly,
not with a false show of bravery; as is implied
in the S, and M, and K; i. e.] they advanced
against them boldly in fight: (M, TA:) and in
like manner, صَدَقُوا فِى القِتَالِ they advanced
boldly in fight: or, accord. to Er-Rághib, the
former means they gave them battle so as to fulfil
their duty: and hence, in the Kur [xxxiii. 23],
رِجَالٌ صَدَقُوا مَا عَاهَدُوا اللّٰهَ عَلَيْهِ, Men who fulfilled
the covenant that they had made with God. (TA.)
And صَدَقَ اللِّقَآءَ, inf. n. صِدْقٌ, He was firm, or
steady, in encounter, or conflict. (M, TA.) And
صَدَقَ ظَنِّى My opinion was, or proved, true, or
correct, like as one says [in the contrary case],
كَذَبَ: (Er-Rághib, TA:) whence, in the Kur
[xxxiv. 19], وَلَقَدْ صَدَقَ عَلَيْهِمْ إِبْلِيسُ ظَنَّهُ, meaning
فِى ظَنِّهِ [i. e. And assuredly Iblees was, or
proved to be, correct in his opinion that he had
formed against them]: but some read ↓ صَدَّقَ,
meaning, as Fr says, حَقَّقَ [i. e. Iblees proved, or
found, to be true, his opinion &c.]. (TA.) And
صَدَقَتْهُ نَفْسُهُ His soul [told him truth; meaning,]
diverted him, or hindered him, or held him back,
from an undertaking, causing him to imagine
himself unable to prosecute it. (TA in art. كذب.)
And صَدَقَ الصُّبْحُ [The dawn shone clearly]. (S in
art. سقط.) [And one says of a word or the like,
يَصْدُقُ عَلَى كَذَا, meaning It applies correctly to
such a thing.] ―
-b2-  صَدَقَ الوَحْشِىُّ: see 2, near the
end.
2
صدّقهُ, (S, M, O, &c.,) inf. n. تَصْدِيقٌ, contr.
of كَذَّبَهُ. (O, * K.) [This explanation implies
several meanings here following.] He attributed,
or ascribed, to him truth, veracity, or the speaking
truth. (Msb.) And He said to him, “Thou hast
spoken truth. ” (Msb.) He accepted, or admitted,
[or assented to, or believed,] what he said: (M:)
you say, صدّقهُ فِى حَدِيثِهِ [He accepted, &c.,
what he said in his information, or narration]:
(S:) and you say صدّق بِلِسَانِهِ [He assented to the
truth of what was said with his tongue]; as well
as بِقَلْبِهِ [with his heart, or mind]. (T in art.
اَمن.) He held him to be a speaker of truth.
(MA.) [He found him to be a speaker of truth.
He, or it, proved him to be a speaker of truth;
verified him; or confirmed the truth of what he
said: see an ex. in a verse cited voce بَيْنٌ.] He
found it (an opinion) to be true, or veritable.
(Ksh and Bd and Jel, in xxxiv. 19.) He verified
it; confirmed its truth; or proved it to be true,
or veritable; i. e. an opinion [&c.]; syn. حَقَّقَهُ:
(Ksh and Bd, ibid.:) one says, صَدَّقَ الخَبَرَ الخُبْرُ
[The trial, proof, or test, verified the information].
(S in art. خبر.) See 1, near the end. In the
saying in the Kur [xxxix. 34], وَالَّذِى جَآءَ بِالصِّدْقِ
وَصَدَّقَ بِهِ, [which seems to be best rendered But
he who hath brought the truth and he who hath
accepted it as the truth, (see كَذَّبَ بِالأَمْرِ,)] 'Alee
the son of Aboo-Tálib is related to have said that
by الذى جآء بالصدق is meant Mohammad; and
by الذى صدّق به, Aboo-Bekr: or, as some say,
Gabriel and Mohammad [are meant by the former
and the latter respectively]: or by the former,
Mohammad; and by the latter, [every one of]
the believers: (M:) accord. to Er-Rághib, by
وصدّق به is meant and hath found, or proved, to
be true (حَقَّقَ) that which he hath brought by
word, by that which he hath aimed at (بِمَا تَحَرَّاهُ)
by deed. (TA.) ―
-b2-  صدّق is also said to signify
He said, “This thing is the truth; ” like حَقَّقَ.
(TA in art. حق.) ―
-b3-  And this verb also denotes
المُبَالَغَةُ فِى الصِّدْقِ: thus in the saying,
صَدَّقَتْ فِيهِمْ ظُنُونِى
[My opinions respecting them were, or proved to
be, very true or correct]. (Ksh, in xxxiv. 19.) ―
-b4-
صدّق الوَحْشِىُّ, (O, K, TA,) or ↓ صَدَقَ, (so in a
copy of the M,) (tropical:)  The wild animal ran without
looking aside, when charged upon, or attacked:
(M, O, K, TA:) mentioned by IDrd. (O, TA.)
-A2-  صَدَّقَهُمْ He exacted from them the poor-rate.
(TA. [See صَدَقَةٌ.]) ―
-b2-  See also 5.
3
صَادَقْتُهُ, (M,) inf. n. مُصَادَقَةٌ (S, M, O, K)
and صِدَاقٌ, (M, O, K,) the latter like كِتَابٌ,
(TA, [in the CK erroneously written صَداق,]) I
acted, or associated, with him as a friend, or as
a true, or sincere, friend. (S, * M, O, * K. *) [See
also 6.]
4
اصدق المَرْأَةَ He named for the woman a
صَدَاق [or dowry]: (S, M, * O, K:) or he gave
her her صَدَاق: (M, * Msb:) or he appointed her,
or assigned her, a صَدَاق, on taking her as his
wife: (TA:) and he married her, or took her as
his wife, on the condition of his giving her a
صَدَاق. (Msb.) And sometimes this verb is
doubly trans.; whence, in a trad., مَا ذَا تُصْدِقُهَا
فَقَالَ إِزَارِى [It was said, “What is it that thou
meanest for her, or givest her, as her dowry? ” and
he said, “My waist-wrapper ”]. (Mgh.)
5
تصدّق عَلَيْهِ He gave him (i. e. the poor,
Mgh, Msb) what is termed صَدَقَة, (M, Mgh,
Msb,) meaning [an alms, or] what is given for
the sake of God, (M,) or what is given with the
desire of obtaining a recompense from God:
(M, * Mgh:) and عليه ↓ صَدَّقَ signifies the same;
(M, TA;) and in this sense صدّق is [said by
some to be] used in the Kur lxxv. 31. (TA.)
Hence, in the Kur [xii. 88], وَتَصَدَّقْ عَلَيْنَا: (TA:)
or this means (assumed tropical:)  And do thou confer a favour
upon us by giving that which is [not like the
mean merchandise that we have brought, but of
middling quality,] between good and bad. (M.)
One says, تَصَدَّقْتُ بِكَذَا, meaning I gave such a
thing as a صَدَقَة. (Msb.) See an ex. voce شِقٌّ.
The saying, in a trad., إِنَّ اللّٰهَ تَصَدَّقَ عَلَيْكُمْ بِثُلُثِ
أَمْوَالِكُمْ, meaning (tropical:)  [Verily God] hath conferred
a favour [upon you by giving you a third of your
possessions to bequeath to whom ye will], if
correct, is tropical. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  It is said by Ibn-Es-Seed, on the authority of AZ and IJ, and
mentioned by IAmb, that تصدّق signifies also
He asked, or begged, for what is termed صَدَقَة
[or alms]: but Fr and As and others disallow the
beggar's being called مُتَصَدِّق: (Az, TA:) IKt
says that the verb is improperly used in this sense
by the vulgar: (Msb:) [and accord. to J and
Sgh,] one says, مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ يَسْأَلُ, and one should
not say يَتَصَدَّقُ. (S, O.)
6
تَصَادُقٌ signifies The acting, or associating,
as friends, or as true, or sincere, friends, one with
another. (K. [See also 3.]) And I. q. صِدْقٌ:
(TA:) [or rather mutual صِدْق; contr. of تَكَاذُبٌ:]
one says, تَصَادَقَا فِى الحَدِيثِ and فِى المَوَدَّةِ (S,
O, TA) They were true, or sincere, each to the
other, in information, or narration, and in love,
or affection; contr. of تَكَاذَبَا. (O, TA.)
صَدْقٌ is an inf. n. of صَدَقَ [q. v.]: (M, K:) ―
-b2-
and is used as an epithet, applied to a man &c.:
(S, M, O, K, TA:) [and] ↓ صِدْقٌ [also, if not a
mistranscription for صَدْقٌ,] is an inf. n. used as an
epithet, applied to a man and to a woman: (so in
a copy of the M and in the TA:) [it is said that]
the former signifies Hard, (S, M, O, Msb,)
applied to a spear, (S, M, O,) and to other things:
(M:) or even, or straight; (S, O;) or it signifies
thus also, applied to a spear, and to a sword:
(M:) or hard and even or straight, applied to a
spear, (K, TA,) and to a man, (K,) or to the
latter as meaning hard: or, as IB says, on the
authority of IDrst, it is not from hardness, but
means combining those qualities that are commended; and it is applied to a spear as meaning
long and pliant and hard, and the like; and to a
man, and to a woman likewise [without ة, but see
what follows], as meaning true in hardness and
strength and goodness; for, IDrst says, if it meant
hard, one would say حَجَرٌ صَدْقٌ and حَدِيدٌ صَدْقٌ,
which one does not: (TA:) and, applied to anything, (O, K, TA,) it means complete, or perfect,
(Kh, O, K, TA,) thus applied to a man, (TA,)
such as is commended; (O;) fem. with ة, (O, K,
TA,) applied to a woman: (O:) the pl. is صُدْقٌ,
applied to a company of men, (S, O, K,) and
صُدُقٌ (K) and صَدْقُونَ, so applied, and صَدْقَاتٌ
applied to women: (O, K:) and Ru-beh says,
describing asses,
مَقْذُوذَةُ الآذَانِ صَدْقَاتُ الحَدَقْ
meaning [Rounded, as though pared, in the ears,]
penetrating in the eyes; (O, TA;) which is [said
to be] tropical. (TA.) صَدْقٌ signifies also Firm,
or steady, in encounter, or conflict: (M:) or one
says صَدْقُ اللِّقَآءِ, applying this epithet to a man,
(S, O, K, TA,) meaning thus: (TA:) and صَدْقُ
النَّظَرِ [firm, or steady, in look]. (S, O, K, TA.
[Said in the TA to be tropical.])
صِدْقٌ is an inf. n. of صَدَقَ [q. v.]: (M, K, &c.:)
or a simple subst., (K,) signifying [Truth;
veracity; or] agreement of what is said with what
is conceived in the mind and with the thing told
of, together; otherwise it is not complete صِدْق,
as expl. above in the first paragraph of this art.
(Er-Rághib, TA.) ―
-b2-  It is also syn. with شِدَّةٌ
[meaning Hardness; firmness, compactness, or
soundness; strength, power, or force; vigour,
robustness, sturdiness, or hardiness; and courage,
bravery, or firmness of heart]: (K, TA: [in the
latter of which it is said to be tropical; but this is
evidently not the case accord. to the O, in which
it is said that it radically denotes قُوَّةٌ (i. e.
strength, force, &c.,) in a saying &c.: in the K
it is implied by the context that it is syn. with
شِدَّة when used as the complement of a prefixed
n. in instances mentioned in what here follows:
but Sgh says, more correctly,]) a noun signifying
anything to which goodness is attributed is prefixed to صِدْق, governing it in the gen. case; so
that one says (O) رَجُلُ صِدْقٍ (Sb, M, O, K) [A
man of good nature or disposition or character
&c.], contr. of رَجُلُ سَوْءٍ; (Sb, M;) and صَدِيقُ
صِدْقٍ [a friend of good nature &c.]; (O, K;)
and likewise اِمْرَأَةُ صِدْقٍ [a woman of good nature
&c.]; (K;) and in like manner also حِمَارُ صِدْقٍ
[an ass of a good kind]; (Sb, M, K;) and ثَوْبُ
صِدْقٍ [a garment, or piece of cloth, of good
quality]. (Sb, M.) The saying in the Kur [x.
93], (O,) وَلَقَدْ بَوَّأْنَا بَنِى اِسْرَائِيلَ مُبَوَّأَ صِدْقٍ means
And verily we assigned to the Children of Israel
a good place of abode. (O, K.) ―

صَدَقَةٌ [An alms; i. e.] a gift (S, M, Mgh,
O, Msb, K) to the poor (S, O, Msb) for the sake
of God, (M, K,) or to obtain a recompense from
God; (M, * Mgh, K; *) a portion which a man
gives forth from his property by way of propitiation, [to obtain the favour of God,] like
زَكَاةٌ, except that the former is primarily applied
to such as as is supererogatory, and the latter to such
as is obligatory: but it is said to be applied to
such as is obligatory [i. e. to the زَكَاة, q. v.,
meaning the poor-rate, which is the portion, or
amount, of property, that is given therefrom, as
the due of God, by its possessor, to the poor,
according to a fixed rate,] when the person who
does so aims at conformity with the truth in his
deed: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [in this latter sense,
which is indicated in the S and O &c., and more
plainly in the M, it is very frequently used:] and
thus it is used in the Kur ix. 104, and in like
manner its pl. in ix. 60: (Er-Rághib, TA:) the
pl. is صَدَقَاتٌ. (S, M, O, Msb.) It is said in a
trad., لَا صَدَقَةَ فِى الإِبِلِ الجَارَّةِ [There is no poorrate in the case of working camels], because they
are the riding-camels of the people; for the poorrate is in the case of pasturing camels, exclusively
of the working. (S in art. جر.) ―

for, a bride:] the pl. of صداق is صُدُقٌ, (M,

this is accordant to analogy, but has not been
heard; (Mgh;) the pl. of ↓ صَدُقَةٌ is صَدُقَاتٌ; (S,

and صُدُقَاتٌ, (O, * Msb, K,) which last is the

named السُّهَا and الصَّيْدَقُ; and the third is الحَوَرُ:

أَصْدَقُ [More, and most, true or veracious].
One says أَصْدَقُ مِنْ قَطَاةٍ [More veracious than
a katáh]; because the bird thus called cries
قَطَا قَطَا; [thus telling where it is to be found;]
its name being imitative of its cry: (Meyd, and
TA in art. قطو:) hence it is called by the Arabs
↓ الصَّدُوقُ: the saying is a prov. (Meyd.)
ذُو مَصْدَقٍ, (JK, S, M, O,) with fet-h, (S,) or
↓ ذُو مِصْدَقٍ like مِنْبَر, (K,) applied to a man,
(JK, M,) [i. e.] applied to a courageous man,
(S, O, K,) means الحَمْلَةِ ↓ صَادِقُ [Earnest, not
making a false show of bravery, in the charge, or
assault]; (JK, S, M, O, K;) or courageous [in
the charge, or assault]: (JK:) مَصَادِقُ, occurring
in a verse of Aboo-Dhu-eyb, may be for ذَوُو
مَصَادِقَ; or it may be an anomalous pl. of صِدْقٌ
[used as an epithet], like مَلَامِحُ and مَشَابِهُ [pls.
of لَمْحَةٌ and شَبَهٌ]. (M.) Also, (S, M, O, K,)
applied to a horse, (M,) [i. e.] applied to a fleet
and excellent horse, (S, O,) in like manner, (M,)
meaning الجَرْىِ ↓ صَادِقُ [Earnest in running];
(S, O, K;) as though fulfilling his promise of
running: (S, O: [said in the TA to be tropical:])
Khufáf Ibn-Nudbeh says,
إِذَا مَا اسْتَحَمَّتْ أَرْضُهُ مِنْ سَمَائِهِ
جَرَى وَهْوَ مَوْدُوعٌ وَوَاعِدُ مَصْدَقِ
meaning When his hoofs are wetted with the
sweat of his upper parts, he runs, being left to
himself, not beaten nor chidden, and a fulfiller of
his promise to do his utmost. (S, O.) And sometimes it is applied to an opinion, in like manner
[as meaning True, or sincere]. (M.) ―
-b2-  مَصْدَقٌ
also signifies Hardness. (Th, M.) ―
-b3-  Also i. q.
حَدٌّ [as meaning The edge of a sword]: (TA:) [in
a copy of the M written جِدّ, which I think an
evident mistake; for it is added,] and it is said to
have this meaning in a verse of Dureyd Ibn-Es-
Simmeh [relating to a sword]. (M, TA.)
مِصْدَق: see the next preceding paragraph.
مُصَدَّقٌ A man from whom the poor-rate (صَدَقَة)
of his cattle is exacted. (TA.)
مُصَدِّقٌ One who accepts, admits, assents to, or
believes, another in his information, or narration.
(S, TA.)
-A2-  Also The exactor, or collector, (S,
M, O, Msb, K, TA,) of the صَدَقَات, (S, O, Msb,
K, TA,) i. e. (TA) of the حُقُوق [or dues, meaning
poor-rates], (M, TA,) of the cattle, (Msb,) or of
the sheep or goats, (S, M, O, TA,) and of the
camels, (M, O, TA,) for the persons to whom
pertain the shares [thereof]. (TA.)
مُصَّدِّقٌ: see مُتَصَدِّقٌ.
مِصْدَاقٌ A thing that confirms, or proves, the
truth of a thing: (S, K:) [and] a verbal evidence
of the truth, or veracity, of a man. (Har p. 106.)
One says, هٰذَا مِصْدَاقُ هٰذَا This is what confirms,
or proves, the truth of this. (S.) And شَىْءٌ لَيْسَ
لَهُ مِصْدَاقٌ [A thing having nothing to verify it].
(IAar, TA in art. برق.)
مَصْدُوقَةٌ [see 1, near the beginning]. One says
لَيْسَ لِحَمْلَتِهِ مَصْدُوقَةٌ [meaning There is no earnestness attributable to his charge, or assault];
like as one says [in the contr. case], ليس لَهَا مَكْذُوبَةٌ.
(M.)
مُتَصَدِّقٌ One who gives what is termed صَدَقَة
[meaning alms]: (S, O, Msb, K:) accord. to Kh,
it means thus, and also one who asks [alms]; (O,
TA;) and IAmb says the like; but Az says that
the skilful of the grammarians disallow this; and
thus say Fr and As and others: (TA:) [J, also,
and Sgh and Fei, say that] it has only the former
meaning: (S, O, Msb:) it is also pronounced
↓ مُصَّدِّقٌ, by substitution [of ص for ت] and incorporation [of one ص into the other]; (S, * O, *
Msb, K; *) and this pronunciation of the pl. both
masc. and fem. occurs in the Kur lvii. 17, (S, O,
K,) where Ibn-Ketheer and Aboo-Bekr, differing
from others, read without teshdeed to the ص. (O.)
