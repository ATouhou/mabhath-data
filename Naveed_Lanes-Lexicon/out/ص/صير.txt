صير1
صَارَ كَذَا, (T, S, Msb,) aor. يَصِيرُ, (S,) inf. n.
صَيْرُورَةٌ (S, Msb) and صَيْرٌ, (S,) He, or it, attained to the state, or condition, of such a thing;
(T;) became such a thing; (T, Msb;) in which
sense the verb is like كَانَ [in meaning, when the
latter is non-attributive, and in having its subject
in the nom. case and its predicate in the accus.].
(T.) You say, صَارَ زَيْدٌ رَجُلًا Zeyd became a man;
or attained to the state, or condition, of a man.
(TA.) And صَارَ زَيْدٌ غَنِيًّا Zeyd became rich, not
having been so. (Msb.) And صَارَ العَصِيرُ خَمْرًا
The expressed juice became wine. (Msb.) [And
صَارَ لَا شَىْءَ عِنْدَهُ He became in a state, or condition, in which there was not anything in his
possession. And صَارَ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا He became in the
state, or condition, of doing such a thing; i. e. he
became occupied, or engaged, in doing such a
thing; or he set about, began, commenced, took
to, or betook himself to, doing such a thing; like
جَعَلَ. And صَارَ لَا يَفْعَلُ شَيْئًا He became in the
state, or condition, of not doing anything; or he
became unoccupied in doing anything. And
صَارَ لَا يَتَكَلَّمُ He became in the state of not
speaking; he became speechless. And صَارَ يَتَفَكَّرُ
فِى كَذَا He became in a state of reflection upon
such a thing; he began to reflect upon such a
thing.] ―
-b2-  One says also, صَارَ الأَمْرُ إِلَى كَذَا, (M,
A, Msb, K,) aor. as above, (TA,) inf. n. مَصِيرٌ,
(S, M, A, Msb, K,) which is anomalous, being
regularly مَصَارٌ, like مَعَاشٌ, (S,) and صَيْرٌ and
صَيْرُورَةٌ, (M, A, K,) i. e. رَجَعَ إِلَيْهِ: (Msb:) [but
this is a loose explanation; the meaning being,
The thing, or affair, or case, came eventually (see
صِيرٌ) to such a state, or condition:] the difference
between مَصِيرٌ and مَرْجِعٌ is, that the former word
necessarily implies a difference [of the latter state
or condition] from the former state or condition;
but the latter word does not. (Bd in iii. 156.)
[In this case, the ulterior state or condition is
likened to a place: for] ―
-b3-  صَارَ also signifies He,
or it, attained in respect of place: so in the
saying, صَارَ زَيْدٌ إِلَى عَمْرٍو [Zeyd came, or went,
or pursued a course that brought him, to 'Amr].
(TA.) صِرْتُ إِلَى فُلَانٍ [I came, &c., to such a
one] is similar to the phrase in the Kur [iii. 27]
وَإِلَى اللّٰهِ الْمَصِيرُ [And to God, as the ultimate
object, is the transition, or course, of every human
being]. (S.) [Hence, أًلَا إِلَى اللّٰهِ تَصِيرُ الْأُمُورُ, in
the Kur xlii. last verse, which Bd explains by
adding the words بِارْتِفَاعِ الوَسَائِطِ وَالتَّعَلُّقَاتِ; the
meaning being, Verily to God are things, or
events, referrible, mediately and dependently: in
the Expos. of the Jel expl. as meaning تَرْجِعُ.] ―
-b4-
[And in like manner one says, صَارَ لَهُ كَذَا Such a
thing came to, betided, or befell, him, or it: and
hence, he, or it, came to have, or became possessed
of, such a thing.] ―
-b5-  And صَارَ فِى أَرْضِ فَلَاةٍ [He
became, or came to be, meaning he found himself,
in a desert, or waterless, land]; i. q. وَقَعَ فِيهَا.
(Msb in art. وقع.) And صَارَ فِى الرَّبِيعِ [He
entered, lit. became in, the season called ربيع];
i. q. أَرْبَعَ [which is expl. in the S as signifying
دَخَلَ فِى الرَّبِيعِ]. (K in art. ربع.)
-A2-  صَيْرٌ signifies also The returning of seekers after herbage to
the watering-places. (O, K.) And one says,
صَارَ الرَّجُلُ, aor. يَصِيرُ, [inf. n. صَيْرٌ,] The man
stayed, or abode, at the water. (TA.) And
صَارَ النَّاسُ المَآءَ The people stayed, or abode, at the
water. (M, K, TA.)
-A3-  صَارَهُ, (S,) first pers. صِرْتُهُ,
(M,) aor. as above, (S,) inf. n. صَيْرٌ, (K,) a dial.
var. of صَارَهُ having for its aor. يَصُورُهُ, [q. v.,] (S,)
He cut it; (S, M, K;) and clave it, or split it.
(M.) ―
-b2-  And in like manner, [i. e. as a dial. var.
of صَارَهُ having for its aor. يَصُورُهُ,] He made it to
incline, or lean. (S.) You say, صَارَ وَجْهَهُ, aor.
يَصِيرُ, (M,) as also يَصُورُ, (M and K in art. صور,)
He turned his face towards a person or thing.
(M.) And صِرْتُ عُنُقَهُ I twisted his neck. (M.)
[Respecting the phrase فَصِرْهُنَّ إِلَيْكَ in the Kur ii.
262, accord. to one reading, see 1 in art. صور.] ―
-b3-
صَارَهُ, aor. يَصِيرُ, inf. n. صَيْرٌ, signifies also حَبَسَهُ
[He confined, restricted, &c., him, or it]. (Msb.)
2
صيّرهُ كَذَا He made him, or it, to be in such
a state, or condition; or he made him, or it, to be
such a thing; [as also ↓ أَصَارَهُ;] syn. جَعَلَهُ. (S.)
You say, صَيَّرَنِى لَهُ عَبْدًا and ↓ أًصَارَنِى [He made
me to be to him a slave]. (A.) ―
-b2-  [And صَيَّرَهُ إِلَى
كَذَا and ↓ أَصَارَهُ He, or it, made, or caused, him,
or it, to come, or to pursue a course that led, to
such a state, or condition; brought, or reduced,
him, or it, thereto.] 'Omeyleh El-Fezáree said
to his paternal uncle Ibn-'Ankà, ↓ مَا الَّذِى أَصَارَكَ
إِلَى مَا أَرَى يَا عَمِّ [What hath made thee to come,
or brought thee, or reduced thee, to the state, or
condition, that I see, O my paternal uncle?].
(M.) [In this case, the ulterior state or condition
is likened to a place: for] you say, صَيَّرَهُ إِلَيْهِ and
↓ أَصَارَهُ [meaning He, or it, made him to come, or
brought him, to him, or it; i. e., to a person, or
place, or to a state, or condition:] (M, K:) and
صَيَّرَتْنِى إِلَيْهِ الحَاجَةُ and ↓ أَصَارَتْنِى [Want, or
need, or necessity, made me to come, or brought
me, to him, or it]. (A.) And [hence,] صَيَّرَ إِلَيْهِ
الأَمْرَ He committed to him the thing, or affair;
syn. فَوَّضَهُ اليه. (M in art. فوض.) [And صَيَّرَ لَهُ
كَذَا He made such a thing to come to, betide, or
befall, him, or it: and consequently, he made
him, or it, to have, or become possessed of, such a
thing.] ―
-b3-  تَصْيِيرٌ is also by word, or covenant, as
well as by deed. (Bd in ii. 20.) [You say, صَيَّرَهُ كَذَا
meaning He asserted, or pronounced, him, or it,
to be in such a state, or condition; or to be such a
thing: in which case, also, it is syn. with جَعَلَهُ,
whereby it is expl. in the S. And صَيَّرَ لَهُ كَذَا
He asserted, or pronounced, such a thing to belong to him, or it; asserted, or pronounced, him,
or it, to have such a thing; attributed to him, or
it, such a thing: and appointed or assigned, to
