صَدَّعَ see 1, in three places.
-A2-  [Freytag adds two
other explanations of صدّع: namely, “Immisit,”
followed by an accus. and فى; taken by inference
from the Ham p. 196, l. 12 from the bottom: and
“ Rupit, perdidit; ” from Reiske's additions to
Golius: but both of these require consideration.]

مِثْلُ الزُّجَاجَةِ صَدْعُهَا لَمْ يُجْبَرِ

a thing, (O, K, TA,) of sheep or goats, and the
like: (TA:) an inf. n. used as a subst. [properly

-b3-  And The
plants of the earth; (K;) because they cleave it:
(TA:) [i. e.] the plants from over which the

means And the earth which is cloven by the
plants (Th, Bd, TA) and by the springs. (Bd.)
-A2-  And i. q. إِلْبٌ: (TA:) you say, النَّاسُ عَلَيْهِمْ

Penetrating, sharp, or effective, in his affair.
(TA.)
-A2-  [It is said that] صَدَعٌ signifies also The
صَدَأ [i. e. rust] of iron. (K.) [But this seems to
be a mistake, which has arisen from what here
follows.] It is said that [a certain person called]
El-Uskuff [which generally means “ the bishop ”],
being asked by 'Omar respecting the Khaleefehs, designated [him who was afterwards]
the fourth of them ['Alee] as صَدَعٌ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ,
meaning [lit.] thereby A mountain-goat of iron;
using it as a hyperbolical appellation to denote
his might and courage and endurance and hardness: or the phrase, as some relate it, is صَدَأٌ حَديدٌ
[which may be rendered, “light or active in
body ” (a meaning assigned to صَدَأٌ and صَدَعٌ,
the latter of which is said to be in this sense the
original), and “ sharp ”]; or صَدَأُ حَدِيدٍ [i. e.
“ rust of iron,” app. alluding to his frequent and
long-continued wearing of mail and bearing of
weapons]; which last is thought by As to be
most probably correct. (O, * TA.)

[See also صِدْعٌ.]) ―

termed] صِرْمَة of camels; (S, O, K;) and so
↓ صَدِيعٌ: (S, O, K: *) or, accord. to AZ, a herd
of camels amounting to sixty. (O, TA.) And
A separate flock, or herd, of sheep or goats; as
also ↓ صَدِيعٌ: (S, O, K:) or, as some say, of
these also, amounting to sixty: and it is said to
signify also a herd of gazelles: (TA:) and ↓ صَدِيعٌ
signifies also a herd of oxen [probably meaning
wild oxen]. (O, TA.) ―

صِدْعَةٌ مِنْ مَالٍ i. e. [On him lies a debt of] a

says, بَيْنَهُمْ صَدَعَاتٌ فِى الرَّأْىِ وَالهَوَى (tropical:)  Between

they, notwithstanding the divisions that are among
them, are intelligent and generous]. (TA.) [It
is stated in the TA, among the additions to the
K in this art., that one says also, إِنَّهُمْ عَلَى مَا تَرَى
لَكِرَامٌ ↓ مِنْ صَدَاعَتِهِمْ app. as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Verily
they, notwithstanding what thou seest of their
disunion, are generous: but I think it most
probable that صَدَاعَتِهِمْ is a mistranscription for
صَدَعَاتِهِمْ.]
-A2-  [Reiske, as stated by Freytag,
explains it as signifying also Camels going
swiftly.]
صُدَاعٌ (assumed tropical:)  Headache: (S, O, Msb, K:) Er-Rághib
says that it is like a splitting in the head by reason
of pain; and is a metaphorical term. (TA.)
صَدِيعٌ Either half of a garment, or piece of
cloth, (O, K,) that is slit in halves: (O:) and a
thing [شَىْءٌ accord. to the copies of the K, but I
think that the right reading is شَىْءٍ i. e. “ of a
thing,”] that is cloven, or split, or slit, in halves:
pl. صُدُعٌ. (K.) See also صِدْعَةٌ, first sentence.
It is also said to signify A [garment of the kind
called] رِدَآء, that is slit in halves. (TA.) And A
new patch in an old and worn-out garment. (O,
K.) And A garment much rent. (TA.) And

K.) And A shirt [of a middling size] between
two shirts, neither large nor small. (TA.) ―
-b2-
See also صِدْعَةٌ, second and third sentences, in

applied to a mountain-goat, it signifies Youthful:

الخَلْقِ; (O, K, TA;) i. e. between two [in size];
like صَدَعٌ [q. v.]. (TA.)

(S, O, K:) because it cleaves the night. (O.)
-A3-
And Fresh milk which is put in a place, and
becomes cool, and overspread by a thin skin: (O,
K:) so called because you skim off (تَصْدَعُ, lit.
“ cleave,”) that thin skin from the clear milk.
(O.)
صَدَاعَةٌ: see a saying mentioned above, voce
صَدَعَاتٌ.
صَادِعٌ [act. part. n. of صَدَعَ; Cleaving, splitting,

[i. e. And when separation from her appeared,
like as appear the cleaving cracks in the surface
of the hard and smooth rock]: it may be that
↓ صَدَعَ is syn. with تَصَدَّعَ in some dial. [and that
صَوَادِع is pl. of its part. n.]: or this may be an
instance of a possessive epithet, meaning having a
cleaving. (TA.)
هُوَ أَصْدَعُهُمْ بِالصَّوَابِ فِى أَسْرَعِ جَوَابٍ (assumed tropical:)  [app.
