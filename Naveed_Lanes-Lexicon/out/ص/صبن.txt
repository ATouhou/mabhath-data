Q. Q. 1
صَبْيَنَ or صَيْبَنَ: see what next precedes.
صَبْنَآءُ The hand of a player at a game of hazard
inclined for acting treacherously to a companion.
(IAar, K.)
صَابُونٌ a word of well-known meaning, (S, M,
K,) [Soap;] a compound with which clothes [&c.]
are washed: the best of which is made of pure
olive-oil and clear potash and good جِير [meaning
lime], well cooked [i. e. boiled], and dried, and
cut into particular shapes: the مَغْرِبِىّ sort is not
cut, nor well cooked [or boiled], but is like cooked
starch: (TA:) it is hot and dry; and produces
a pleasurable sensation in the body; (K;) but the
washing the head with it hastens hoariness: (TA:
[in which many other supposed properties of it
are mentioned:]) IDrd says the word is not of the
language of the Arabs: (TA:) [Fei, in the Msb,
fancifully derives it from صَبَنَ الكَأْسَ, because it
removes filths and impurities:] MF says that it is
one of the words common to all languages, Arabic
and Persian and Turkish and others [as Greek
&c.]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] صُابُونُ الهُمُومِ is a term

[
صَابُونِىٌّ Of, or relating to, soap; saponaceous.
