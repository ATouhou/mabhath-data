صحف2
تَصْحِيفٌ signifies (primarily, Msb) The
making a mistake (S, O, Msb, K, TA) in a
صَحِيفَة, (S, O, K, TA,) by reason of the ambiguity, or dubiousness, of the letters: a postclassical term: (TA:) or the reading a thing in a
manner at variance with what the writer intended, or at variance with the conventional
usage thereof: (Mgh:) a secondary signification
is the altering a word, or an expression, in such
a manner that the meaning intended by the application [thereof] becomes altered: (Msb:) or
it consists in the altering of a diacritical point
[or points]; as in النفى for النقى, or vice versâ:
(KT, after التَّحْرِيفُ:) one says, صحّف اللَّفْظَ He
altered the word, or expression, [in such a manner
that the meaning intended by the application
thereof became altered, or] so that it became
dubious [to the reader]. (Msb.) [See also تَحْرِيف,
in the first paragraph of art. حرف.]

أُصْحِفَ It had صُحُف [i. e. written pieces of
paper or of skin] (S, O, K, TA) collected in it,
(S, O,) or put in it (K, TA) between two boards.
(TA.)

تصحّف, said of a word, or an expression, It
became altered [so as to have a meaning different
from that intended by the application thereof,
(see 2,) or] so as to be dubious. (Msb.) One
says, تصحّف عَلَيْهِ لَفْظُ كَذَا [Such a word, or
such an expression, became altered so as to be
dubious to him]. (O, K. *)
صَحْفَةٌ [A sort of bowl;] a vessel like the قَصْعَةٌ,
(S, ISd, O, Msb, K, * TA,) expanded, wide, (ISd,
TA,) or a large, expanded قَصْعَة, (Mgh,) or,
accord. to Z, an oblong قَصْعَة, (Msb,) that
satisfies the hunger of five [men] (Ks, S, ISd,
Mgh, O, TA) and the like of them: (ISd, TA:)
Ks says, (S, O,) the largest sort of قَصْعَة is the
جَفْنَة; next to which is the قَصْعَة [properly so
called], (S, O, K,) which satisfies the hunger of
ten [men]; (S, O;) then, the صَحْفَة, (S, O, K,)
which satisfies the hunger of five; (S, O;) then,
the مِئْكَلَة, (S, O, K,) which satisfies two men,
and three; (S, O;) and then, the ↓ صُحَيْفَة, (S,
O, K,) which satisfies one man: (S, O:) the pl.
of صَحْفَةٌ is صِحَافٌ. (S, O, Mgh, Msb.) It is
said in a prov., اِسْتَفْرَغَ فُلَانٌ مَا فِى صَحْفَتِهِ Such
a one chose for himself, as his share, [or exhausted, all of] what was in his صحفة. (TA.)
صَحَفِىٌّ One who makes mistakes in reading the
صَحِيفَة [or writing, or written piece of paper or
of skin]; incorrectly termed by the vulgar صُحُفِىٌّ,
with two dammehs; (O, K;) [for the formation
of a rel. n. from a pl. of this kind (i. e. from
صُحُفٌ) is not allowable,] though the pl. is not
restored to the sing. in forming the rel. n. in the
case of proper names, such as أَنْمَارِىٌّ &c., nor in
the case of words that are used in a manner like
that of proper names, such as أَنْصَارِىٌ &c.: (O:)
or a learner, or one who acquires knowledge,
(Mgh, Msb,) from the صَحِيفَة, (Mgh,) inferior
[in rank] to the مَشَايِخِ [pl. of شَيْخٌ]: (Msb:) a
rel. n. from صَحِيفَةٌ; (Mgh, Msb;) like حَنَفِىٌّ and
بَجَلِىٌّ from حَنِيفَةُ and بَجِيلَةُ: (Msb:) and
↓ مُصَحِّفٌ signifies the same as صَحَفِىٌّ [in the
former of these senses]. (TA.)
صِحَافٌ Small places that are made for water
to collect and remain therein (مَنَاقِعُ صِغَارٌ تُتَّخَذُ
لِلْمَآءِ): pl. صُحُفٌ. (Esh-Sheybánee, O, K.)
صَحِيفٌ [appears from what here follows, to be
syn. with ↓ صَحِيفَةٌ, or rather it is a coll. gen. n.
of which the latter is the n. un.:] (tropical:)  The surface of
the ground or earth; (O, K, TA;) as being
likened to the thing [i. e. paper or skin] that is
written upon. (TA.) ―

Msb) or of skin; (Msb;) a writing, or thing
written; a book, or volume; a letter, i. e. an
epistle; syn. كِتَابٌ; (S, O, K;) [syn. with كِتَابٌ
in all of these senses; in the last of them in an
anecdote related in Freytag's Arab. Prov. i.
721-2, and in Har p. 119, q. v.;] and a [portion
of a book, such as is termed] كُرَّاسَة; and a
register; [for] in the إِنْقَاع [a title of several
books, it is said that] the كُرَّاسَة and ↓ مُصْحَف
and صَحِيفَة and كِتَاب and دَفْتَر are one: (MA:)
pl. صُحُفٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and صُحْفٌ, a
contraction of the former, (TA,) and صَحَائِفُ,
(S, O, Msb, K,) like سَفَائِنُ pl. of سَفِينَةٌ; (Lth, O;)
the first of these pls. anomalous, (Lth, Sb, O,
K,) the sing. being likened to قَضِيتٌ (Sb, O, TA)
and قَلِيبٌ (Sb, TA) and رَغِيفٌ, (O,) of which the
pls. are قُضُبٌ (Sb, O, TA) and قُلُبٌ (Sb, TA)
and رُغُفٌ: (O:) [or صَحِيفٌ may be its original,
as well as regular, sing.:] see the next preceding
paragraph. صُحُفِ إِبْرٰهِيمَ وَمُوسَى, in the Kur
[lxxxvii. last verse], means [In the books of
Abraham and Moses; i. e.] the books revealed to
Abraham and Moses. (O.) [صَحِيفَةٌ also means
The record of the actions of anyone, that is kept
in heaven: (see رَقٌّ:) one says, صَحِيفَنُهُ سَوْدَآءُ,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  The record of his actions is black; a
phrase often used in the present day, in speaking
of a bad man.] Mohammad [the Hanafee Imám]
speaks of صُحُف not written upon; saying, فَإِنْ
كَانَتِ السَّرِقَةُ صُحُفًا لَيْسَ فِيهَا كِتَابٌ [And if the
stolen property be papers, or books, not having
any writing upon them]. (Mgh. [See, again,
رَقٌّ.]) ―
-b2-  صَحِيفَةٌ signifies also A plank, board, or
leaf, of a door; like صَحَائِفُ [from which it is
perhaps formed by transposition, or it may be
tropical in this sense]: pl. صَحِيفٌ. (MA.) ―
-b3-
Also (tropical:)  The external skin, or scarf-skin, of the
face: (O, TA:) or as some say, the part thereof
that fronts one: pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]
↓ صَحِيفٌ; or this may be used, in a verse in
which it occurs, for صَحِيفَة. (TA.) ―
-b4-  One says
also صَحَائِفُ مِنْ شَحْمٍ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  Layers of fat].
(A in art. نير.)
صُحَيْفَةٌ: see صَحْفَةٌ.
صَحَّافٌ [A bookseller;] a seller of صُحُف: or
[a bookbinder;] a maker [meaning binder] of
صُحُف. (TA.)
مَصْحَفٌ: see what next follows.
مُصْحَفٌ (Th, S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and ↓ مِصْحَفٌ
(Th, S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ مَصْحَفٌ; (Th, O, K;)
the first of which is the original, (Fr, S, O, Msb,)
being from أُصْحِفَ meaning as expl. above, and
one of certain words that are pronounced by
[some of] the Arabs with kesr to the م instead of
damm because the latter is deemed by them
difficult of utterance, of which words are also
مِخْدَعٌ and مِطْرَفٌ and مِغْزَلٌ and مِجْسَدٌ, (Fr, S,
O,) or, accord. to AZ, Temeem pronounce the م
with kesr, and Keys pronounce it with damm,
[as do most persons in the instance of مصحف in
the present day,] and Th says that مَصْحَفٌ, with
fet-h, is correct and chaste; (O;) [A book, or
volume, consisting of] a collection of صُحُف, (S,
Mgh, O, K, TA,) written upon, and put between
two boards: (TA:) [generally applied in the
present day to a copy of the Kur-án:] and also
signifying a [portion of a book, such as is termed]
كُرَّاسَة: but the former is the primary [and more
common] signification: (Mgh:) pl. مَصَاحِفُ.
(KL.) See also صَحِيفَةٌ.
مِصْحَفٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
مُصَحِّفٌ: see صَحَفِىٌّ.
