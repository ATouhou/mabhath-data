صأى1
صَأَى, (S, M, K,) aor. يَصْئِى, (M,) like
صَعَى aor. يَصْعِى, (S, [in one of my copies of the
S يَصْعَى, which is wrong, or, accord. to the TA,
both are correct, and in the K the pret. is said to
be like سَعَى, which implies that the aor. is like
يَسْعَى,]) inf. n. صَئِىٌّ (S, M, K) and صِئِىٌّ (Ks,
M, K, TA) and صُئِىٌّ, (Ks, K, TA,) said of a
young bird and the like, (S, K,) of a bird and of
a young bird (M) and of a rat or mouse (S, M)
and of a jerboa (S) and of a cat and of a dog (M)
and of a pig and of an elephant, (S, M,) It uttered a cry, or sound; (S, M, K;) as also
↓ تَصَآءَى: (M, K:) and accord. to Fr, one says
also of the scorpion, تَصِىْءُ and تَصْئِى. (S.) It
is said in a prov., تَلْدَغُ العَقْرَبُ وَتَصْئِى or وَتَصِىْءُ,
(As, S, Meyd,) this latter verb being formed by
transposition, (Meyd,) i. e. The scorpion stings
while uttering a cry; (S, Meyd;) the و being a
denotative of state: (As, S:) applied to him who
does wrong in the guise of him who complains of
wrongdoing. (Meyd.) And one says also, جَآءَ
بِمَا صَأَى وَصَمَتَ, (S, K,) and بِمَا صَآءَ وَصَمَتَ
(IAar, S, TA,) صَآءَ being formed by tranposition
from صَأَى, (S,) He brought what was vocal and
what was mute; (S, K;) such as slaves and beasts,
and clothes and silver; (As, TA;) or sheep or
goats, and camels, and gold and silver; (IAar,
TA;) meaning he brought much property: and
this is likewise a prov. (S.)

صَئِىٌّ, of the measure فَعِيلٌ, (TA, [originally an
inf. n., written in a copy of the M صِئْىٌ, but the
former is evidently the right,]) The bitch: so
called because of her cry. (TA.)
