صُوفٌ [Wool;] an appertenance of sheep, (in the
S لِلشَّاةِ, in the M لِلْغَنَمِ, and in the O and Msb
[more definitely] لِلضَّأْنِ,) which is to them like
شَعَرٌ to goats and وَبَرٌ to camels: (M:) [in the
K only said to be well know:] n. un. صُوفَةٌ,
(M,) [i. e.] this latter has a more particular signification [meaning a portion, flock, tuft, or wisp,
of wool]: (S, O, Msb, K:) and sometimes صُوفٌ
is used in the sense of the n. un., as mentioned by
Sb: (M:) the pl. of صُوفٌ is أَصْوَافٌ [meaning
sorts of wool]: (M:) and the dim. of the n. un. is

[An unskilful woman that has found wool]: (As,
O, K:) a prov. (As, O) relating to property
possessed by such as does not deserve to have it:
(As, TA:) because the unskilful woman, when
she lights upon wool, mars it, (O, K,) not spinning it well: (O:) applied to the stupid person
who finds property and wastes it; (O, K;) or to
him who finds that of which he knows not the
value, and wastes it. (Z, TA.) And one says,
فُلَانٌ يَلْبَسُ الصُّوفَ وَالقُطْنَ, meaning Such a one
wears what is made of wool and of cotton. (A,
TA.) In the saying of a poet,
حَلْبَانَةٍ رَكْبَانَةٍ صَفُوفِ
تَخْلِطُ بَيْنَ وَبَرٍ وَصُوفِ
[Of one that is milked and ridden, that yields a
row of bowls of her milk, (but see صَفُوفٌ, of which
other explanations have been given,) that mingles
camels' fur and wool], the latter hemistich means,
as Th says, accord. to IAar, that is sold, and with
the price whereof are purchased camels and sheep:
or, accord. to As, that is quick in her pace; the
drawing back of her fore legs being likened to
[the motion of] the bow of the نَدَّاف who mixes
camels' fur and wool. (M.) One says also,
أَخَذْتُ بِصُوفِ رَقَبَتِهِ (S, M, K, but in the M أَخَذَ,)

the downy hairs upon the back of his neck: (M,
O:) or the skin of his neck: (IAar, S, O, K:) or
the back of his neck, altogether: (Fr, S, O, K:)
or I took him by force: (Abu-l-Ghowth, S, O,
K:) or I followed him, thinking that I should
not reach him, and overtook him; and this one
says whether he lay hold upon his neck or not.
(Abu-s-Semeyda', S, O, K.) And أَعْطَاهُ بِصُوفِ
رَقَبَتِهِ (tropical:)  [He gave it altogether]; like أَعْطَاهُ بِرُمَّتِهِ:
or (as expl. by A' Obeyd, S, O) he gave it gratuitously; not taking a price. (S, O, K.) ―
-b2-
صُوفُ البَحْرِ [lit. The wool of the sea] is a thing
[or substance] in the form of the animal صُوف
[i. e., of wool; evidently meaning sea-weed resembling wool; such as is found in abundance
thrown up on the beaches of the Red Sea: and
that this is generally, if not in every instance,
meant by the identical Hebrew word
סוּף, as used
in the Bible, has been most satisfactorily shown
in art. “ Red Sea ” (by my deeply-lamented
nephew Edward Stanley Poole) in Dr. William
Smith's “ Dictionary of the Bible ”]: it is said in
one of the أَبَدِيَّات, [see art. ابد,] لَا آتِيكَ مَا بَلَّ
بَحْرٌ صُوفَةً [I will not come to thee as long as a
sea wets a portion of صُوف], or, as Lh relates it,
مَا بَلَّ البَحْرُ صُوفَهُ [as long as the sea wets its
صُوف; meaning, ever]. (M, TA.)
صَوِفٌ: see صَافٌ.
صُوفَةٌ n. un. of صُوفٌ [q. v.]. (M &c.) ―
-b2-  [Also
applied by physicians to A pessary, or suppository, of wool, containing a medicament of some
kind, to be inserted into the vagina or rectum.]
-A2-
Also Any of those who had the management of
aught of the work of the بَيْت [meaning the
House of God, i. e. the Kaabeh], and who were
called ↓ الصُّوفَانُ: (M:) [accord. to the TA, it is
said that الصُّوفَانُ and الصُّوفَةُ are both alike appel-lations applied to any of such persons:] J and
others say that صُوفَةٌ was the father of a tribe of
Mudar, who used to serve the Kaabeh, and to
return with the pilgrims from ' Arafát, in the Time
of Ignorance; and it is implied in the S [that they
were also called آلُ صُوفَانَ, or] that صُوفَة was
also called صُوفَان; and in a saying of Z, that
الصُّوفَان and آلُ صُوفَان were appellations of one
and the same people: [hence, app., the applications of صُوفَةٌ and صُوفَانٌ to any servants of the
Kaabeh:] but accord. to Sgh and the K, آلُ
صُوفَانَ is a mistake for آلُ صَفْوَانَ. (TA.)
صُوفَانٌ, and its fem., with ة: see صَافٌ:
-A2-  and
for the former see also صُوفَةٌ.
-A3-  Also [A species
of agaric, i. e., of the kind of fungus thus called;]
a certain thing [or substance] that comes forth

the purpose of those who strike fire. (TA.)
صُوفَانَةٌ, applied to a ewe, is fem. of صُوفَانٌ:
see صَافٌ. (AHeyth, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also A certain
herb, or leguminous plant, (بَقْلَةٌ,) downy, (M,
K,) and short, (K,) mentioned by Aboo-Nasr as
of the kind termed أَحْرَار [pl. of حُرٌّ], but not
specifically described by him. (AHn, M.)
صُوفِىٌّ, a post-classical word, A man of the
people called the صُوفِيَّة: (Msb:) [formerly applied to any devotee: afterwards, particularly, to
a mystic; one who seeks to raise himself to a high
degree of spiritual excellence by contemplation of
divine things so as to elicit the mysteries thereof:]
the صُوفِيَّة may be so called [from the Greek
sofo\s: or] in relation to the people called آلُ
صُوفَان, [see صُوفَةٌ,] as resembling them in the
devotion of themselves to religious exercises: or in
relation to those called أَهْلُ الصُّفَّةِ, wherefore they
are also called الصُّفِّيَّةُ: or in relation to الصُّوف
[i. e. wool], which is proper to devotees and
recluses: this last is the derivation commonly
received. (TA.)
صُوفَانِىٌّ; and its fem., with ة: see صَافٌ.
