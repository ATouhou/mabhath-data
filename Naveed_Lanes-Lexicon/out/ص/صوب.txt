فَكَيْفَ تُرَجِّى العاذِلَاتُ تَجَلُّدِى
حَمِيمُهَا ↓ وَصَبْرِى إِذَا مَا النَّفْسُ صِيبَ
he explains صِيبَ as being like قُصِدَ, and says that
it may be of the dial. of him who says صَابَ السَّهْمُ;
but [ISd remarks,] I know not how this is, for
صَابَ السَّهْمُ is not trans.; [though, as shown
above, he has mentioned it as being trans.;] and
in my opinion, [he says,] صيب here is from the
phrase صَابَتِ السَّمَآءُ الأَرْضَ [expl. above; the
meaning of the verse being, But how should the
censuring women hope for my constraining
myself to behave with hardiness, and for my
being patient, when the beloved of the soul has
been smitten by death, or by the decree of death;
for ISd adds,] كَأَنَّ المَنِيَّةَ صَابَتِ الحَمِيمَ فَأَصَابَتْهُ
بِصَوْبِهَا. (M, TA. *) ―
-b4-  [اصاب is also used in
many phrases in which its agent is likened to an
archer.] One says, اصاب الصَّوَابَ (tropical:)  [He hit the

in his opinion; contr. of أَخْطَأَ. (A.) And
اصاب بِغْيَتَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He attained, or obtained, the thing
that he sought, or wanted: whence the saying,
اصاب مِنْ زَوْجَتِهِ [and so app. أَصَابَهَا (see سَفَقَ)]
(assumed tropical:)  He obtained his desired enjoyment of his wife:
(Msb:) اصاب مِنِّى occurs in a trad., [as a
euphemism,] said by the wife of Handhaleh,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  He compressed me: (Mgh:) and it
is said in a trad., كَانَ يُصِيبُ مِنْ رَأْسِ بَعْضِ نِسَائِهِ
وَهُوَ صَائِمٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He used to kiss [the head of

And اصاب مِنَ المَالِ وَغَيْرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He took, or took

[See also 10.]) And (assumed tropical:)  He aimed at it; (As, TA;)
(tropical:)  he desired, wished, willed, intended, or meant,
it. (As, M, A, Msb, TA.) One says, أَصَابَ فُلَانٌ
الصَّوَابَ فَأَخْطَأَ الجَوَابَ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one aimed at, and
desired, [to say] that which was right, (As, Msb, *
TA,) and failed of giving rightly the reply. (As,
TA.) And أَيْنَ تُصِيبَانِ (assumed tropical:)  [Whither do ye two
desire to go?]; a saying of Ru-beh. (TA.)
تَجْرِى بِأَمْرِهِ رُخَآءً حَيْثُ أَصَابَ, in the Kur [xxxviii.
35, referring to the wind], has been expl. as
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Running by his command softly, or
gently,] whithersoever He desireth. (M, * TA.)
And اصاب اللّٰهُ الَّذِى أَرَادَ, said in a trad., in reply
to a question respecting the interpretation of a
text, means (assumed tropical:)  God desireth, or meaneth, [thereby,]
what He desireth, or meaneth. (TA.) And
اصاب اللّٰهُ بِكَ خَيْرًا means أَرَادَهُ (tropical:)  [i. e. May God
intend thee good]. (A.) And اصاب alone (assumed tropical:)  He
desired, or intended, or meant, that which was
right. (M, K. *) One says also, اصابهُ بِخَيْرٍ
(assumed tropical:)  [meaning He did good to him]. (El-Muärrij,
TA in art. اسو.) [But] اصابهُ بِكَذَا, (M,) inf. n.
إِصَابَةٌ, (K,) with which are syn. ↓ مُصَابٌ [in
accordance with a usage generally allowable]
(S, TA) and ↓ مُصَابَةٌ, (K, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  [generally]
means He afflicted him with, or by, such a thing;
or gave pain to him thereby. (M, K: * in the
latter, only the inf. n. of the verb in this sense;
and so in other senses.) [Thus one says, اصابهُ بِشَرٍّ
(assumed tropical:)  He afflicted him with evil; or did evil to him:
and اصابهُ بِمَكْرُوهٍ (assumed tropical:)  He afflicted him with, or did
to him, an abominable, or an evil, thing or action:
and اصابهُ بِقَوْلٍ قَبِيحٍ (assumed tropical:)  He afflicted him with, or
said to him, a foul saying: and اصابهُ بِذَحْلٍ
(assumed tropical:)  He punished him by blood-revenge: and اصابهُ
بِمَرَضٍ (assumed tropical:)  He, (i. e. God,) or it, (a thing,) affected
him with disease; or rendered him diseased: and
in many similar cases, the phrase may be well
rendered with a verb derived from the noun; like
phrases in which “ affecit ” (a Latin equivalent of
اصاب) occurs; as in “ honore affecit,” meaning
“ honoravit. ”] El-Hárith Ibn-Khuld El-Makhzoomee says,
رَجُلًا↓أَظُلَيْمُ إِنَّ مُصَابَكُمْ
أَهْدَى السَّلَامَ تَحِيَّةً ظُلْمُ
(assumed tropical:)  [O Dhuleymeh, verily your afflicting a man
who has given the salutation of peace, greeting, is
tyranny]: IB says that this verse is not of El-
'Arjee, as El-Hareeree imagined it to be: the
correct reading is أَظُلَيْمُ, as above: ظليم is an
apocopated from of ظُلَيْمَةُ; which is the dim. of
ظَلُوم: some read أَظَلُومُ: and some, أَسُلَيْمُ: [the
verse is cited accord. to this last reading in the S:]
رَجُلًا is governed in the accus. case by مُصَاب [as
an inf. n.]: and ظُلْمُ is the enunciative of إِنَّ. (L,
TA.) أَصَابَهُمُ الدَّهْرُ بِنُفُوسِهِمْ وَأَمْوَالِهِمْ (assumed tropical:)  means
Time, or fate, afflicted them by destruction, or
extirpation, among themselves and their cattle, or
possessions. (M.) [In the K, الإِصَابةُ is expl. as
signifying الاِحْتِيَاجُ: but the right reading is
evidently الاِجْتِيَاحُ, as Ibr D has remarked in the
margin of my copy of the TA; so that اصاب
signifies (assumed tropical:)  He destroyed, or extirpated; agreeably
with an explanation in the sentence next preceding
above, from the M.] مَنْ يُرِدِ اللّٰهُ بِهِ خَيْرًا يُصِبْ مِنْهُ,
(assumed tropical:)  occurring in a trad., means Him whom God
intendeth good He trieth with afflictions, that He
may recompense him for them. (TA.) And one
says, مَا كُنْتُ مُصَابًا وَلَقَدْ أُصِبْتُ (assumed tropical:)  [app. meaning
I was not affected with weakness of intellect, or
madness, and I have become affected therewith:
see مُصَابٌ, below]. (IAar, TA.)

10
اِسْتَصْوَبَهُ and
اِسْتَصَابَهُ signify the same, (S,
M, A, Msb, K,) (tropical:)  He saw it, considered it, or
held it, to be right; (M, Msb, TA;) namely, his
deed, (S, Msb,) or his opinion, (M, TA,) or his
saying: (A:) Th says, اِسْتَصَبْتُهُ is the regular
form; but the Arabs say, اِسْتَصْوَبْتُ رَأْيَكَ. (M,
TA. [See also 4, latter half.])
صَابٌ A certain species of tree, from which, when
it is pressed, there issues what resembles milk, a
drop of which sometimes spirts into the eye,
producing an effect like that of a flame of fire,
and in some instances weakening the sight: (M,
TA:) or a certain kind of bitter tree; (As, T, M,
K, TA;) one of which is termed ↓ صَابَةٌ: (M, K: *
[in the latter it is said that صَابٌ is the pl. of صَابَةٌ;
but properly speaking, the former is a coll. gen. n.,
and the latter is its n. un.:]) or the expressed
juice of a kind of bitter tree: (S:) but accord. to
the K, this is a mistake, though it is the saying of
leading lexicologists: (TA:) or, as some say, the
expressed juice of the صَبِر [or aloes]. (M.)
صَوْبٌ an inf. n. used as a subst. (Msb) meaning Rain; (Lth, Msb;) and so ↓ صَيِّبٌ, which is
originally [صَيْوِبٌ, i. e.] of the measure فَيْعِلٌ from
الصَّوْبُ: (Bd in ii. 18:) or صَيِّبٌ is an epithet
applied to clouds (غَيْمٌ, Sh, O, or سَحَابٌ, S, Msb)
meaning having rain, (O,) i. q. ذُو صَوْبٍ: (S,
Msb:) or صَوْبٌ and ↓ صَيِّبٌ and ↓ صَيُّوبٌ [the
last of which is written in the CK صَيُوبٌ] all
signify the same, (M, K,) as epithets applied to
rain, meaning pouring forth: (M:) or ↓ صَيُّوبٌ,
which is originally of the measure فَيْعُولٌ, [being
altered from صَيْوُوبٌ,] means rain pouring forth
much, or abundantly: (IDrd, O:) [↓ صَائِبٌ, also,
is applied as an epithet to rain, like صَوْبٌ and
صَيِّبٌ; and] in the phrase صِيبَانُ المَطَرِ, accord. to
Abu-l-'Alà, صِيبَان is pl. of صَائِب; or it may be
an inf. n., like حِرْمَان: and if one say ↓ صَيْبَان,
with fet-h, the meaning is, what has poured forth
of rain, notwithstanding the ى in it, for similar to
this are رَيْحَان from الرَّوْح and عَيْدَان (meaning
“ tall ” palm-trees) from العُوْد. (Ham p. 796.)
-A2-  Also Course, or tendency; syn. قَصْدٌ: so in
the saying, to one who is traversing a desert in
uncertainty and has declined from the right way,
أَقِمْ صَوْبَكَ [Rectify thy course]: and in the phrase
فُلَانٌ مُسْتَقِيمُ الصَّوْبِ [Such a one is pursuing the
right course], said of a person when he is not
declining from his way to the right or left. (TA.
[See also another ex. voce أَوْبٌ.]) ―

a thing; and in this sense صَوْبٌ is used in the
present day]; and جَانِبٌ [which generally has
the latter of these meanings]. (TA.) ―

and of dates, and of other things: (M:) a quantity
collected together of dust or earth: (TA:) or anything collected together: (Kr, M, K:) a place in
which dates are collected and dried is thus called
by the people of El-Felj. (ISk, S.) One says,
دَخَلْتُ عَلَى فُلَانٍ فَإِذَا الدَّنَانِيرُ صُوبَةٌ بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ i. e.
[I went in to such a one, and lo, the deenárs
were] a heap poured out without measure before
him: (S, M, * A: *) or, as some relate the saying,
الدِّينَارُ, which is thus used as a gen. n. (M.)
صَيْبَانٌ: see صَوْبٌ.
صَوَابٌ (assumed tropical:)  A thing that is right, or what is said
and of what is done; [like سَدَادٌ;] (Msb;) contr.
of خَطَأٌ; (S, M, Msb, K;) as also ↓ صَوْبٌ. (S,
Msb, K.) One says, ↓ دَعْنِى وَعَلَىَّ خَطَئِى وَصَوْبِى
i. e. صَوَابِى [meaning (assumed tropical:)  Leave thou me, and on me
be the consequence of my wrong saying or deed,
and my right]. (S.) [And hence the phrase,
frequent in some of the lexicons &c., الصَّوَابُ كَذَا
meaning (assumed tropical:)  The right, or correct, word or wording
or reading is thus: and صَوَابُهُ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  The right,
or correct, writing or wording or reading of it is

↓ مُصِيبٌ (A) and ↓ صَيُوبٌ and ↓ صَوِيبٌ, (M, K,)

epithet, known to IJ, of the measure فَعِيلٌ having
the ف and ل sound and having و for its ع, except
طَوِيلٌ and قَوِيمٌ; for عَوِيصٌ is [held by him to be
only] used as a subst.: صِيَابٌ is pl. of صَائِبٌ, like
صِيَامٌ and قِيَامٌ pls. of صَائِمٌ and قَائِمٌ; either from
الصَّوَابُ فِى الرَّمْىِ or from صَابَ السَّهْمُ الهَدَفَ
having يَصِيبُ for its aor. (M.) [See also صَيُوبٌ
in art. صيب.] One says, إِنَّهُ لَسَهْمٌ صَائِبٌ Verily
it is an arrow that goes right. (TA.) مَعَ
الخَوَاطِئِ سَهْمٌ صَائِبٌ is a prov. [expl. in art. خطأ].

مَصُوبَةٌ: see the next paragraph.
مُصِيبَةٌ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) said by Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà to be originally مُصْوِبَةٌ, (TA,) and ↓ مَصُوبَةٌ

Msb) and ↓ صَابَةٌ, (M, K,) signify the same,
(S, M, A, Msb, K,) An affliction, a calamity, a
misfortune, a disaster, or an evil accident: (M,
Msb, TA:) it is said in the Towsheeh that the
primary signification of مُصِيبَةٌ is a shot with an
arrow: (TA:) the pl. is مَصَائِبُ, (S, M, A, Msb,)
the form commonly obtaining, (Msb,) but irregular, (M,) the Arabs agreeing in pronouncing it
with ء, as though they likened the radical letter to
the augmentative, (S,) or they imagined what is
of the measure مُفْعِلَةٌ to be of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ
without a radical ى or و, (M,) and it is thought
by As to be of the speech of the people of the
cities, (Msb,) and مَصَاوِبُ, (M,) which is the
original form, (S,) or is said to be so, (Msb,) and
is said by Zj to be the form preferred by the
grammarians, (TA,) and مُصِيبَاتٌ. (As, A, Msb.)
قَطٌّ مُصَوَّبٌ A nibbing in which the exterior of
the writing-reed is made to extend beyond the pith:
