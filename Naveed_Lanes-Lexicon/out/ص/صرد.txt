half white and half black, found in trees,] large
in the head and beak, having a talon with which
it preys upon sparrows and other small birds, as
large as the point of a spear: (Mgh, Msb:) some
add to this that it is called المُجَوَّفُ, because of the
whiteness of its belly; and الأَخْطَبُ, because of
the dark, or ashy, dust-colour of its back; and
الأَخْيَلُ [a name now applied to the green woodpecker, picus viridis], because of its diversity of
colour; that it is never seen but upon a branch
(فِى شُعْبَةٍ, and so in the L,) or a tree, (Mgh,
Msb,) and can scarcely ever, or never, be taken,
(Msb,) or can never be taken: (Mgh, L:) it is

it is called سُمَيْطٌ, [perhaps a mistranscription for
شُمَيْطٌ, because black and white,] in the dim. form:

dark, or an ashy, dust-colour, (أَخْضَرَانِ, Lth, Ks,

of which the tongue moves about, (Lth, Ks, L,)
or penetrating within (يَسْتَبْطِنَانِ) the tongue: (S,
M, K:) or two veins, on the right and left of the
tongue: (L:) or, as some say, two bones, which
erect (يُقِيمَانِ) the tongue. (M.) Yezeed Ibn-Es-
Sa'ik in his saying
لَهُ صُرَدَانِ مُنْطَلِقَا اللِّسَانِ
means ذَرِبَانِ [i. e. ذَرِبَا اللِّسَانِ, for ذَرِبٌ لِسَانُهُمَا, as

unbridled, tongue; the phrase that he uses being
