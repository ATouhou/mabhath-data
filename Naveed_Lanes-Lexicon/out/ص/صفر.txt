in the belly, (S, K,) which sticks to the ribs, and
bites them, (M, K,) or, as the Arabs assert, which
bites a man when he is hungry, its bite occasioning
the stinging which a man feels when he is hungry:
(S:) used alike as sing. and pl.; or one is termed
صَفَرَةٌ: (M:) and it is said to be what is meant by
the word in a trad., in which it is disacknowledged: (S, TA:) or a certain reptile (دَابَّة) which
bites the ribs and their cartilages: (M, K:) or a
certain serpent in the belly, which attacks beasts
and men, and which, accord. to the Arabs [of the
time of Ignorance], passes from one to another
more than the mange or scab; (Ru-beh:) the
Prophet, however, denied its doing so: it is said
also that it oppresses and hurts a man when he is
hungry: (A'Obeyd:) this is the explanation approved by Az: (TA:) or, as also ↓ صُفَارٌ, worms
in the belly, (M, K, TA,) and in the cartilages of
the ribs, which cause a man to become very
yellow, and sometimes kill him. (TA.) You say,

hungry. (A.)
-A2-  Accord. to some, (M,) in the

will my soul accept it: (S, TA:) said of that
which one does not love. (A.)

responsibility: syn. عَقْدٌ. (M, L, K. [In some
copies of the K, فقد.])
-A5-  Also (S, M, Msb, K)
and sometimes [صَفَرُ,] imperfectly decl., (K,) but
all make it perfectly decl. except AO, who makes
it imperfectly decl. because it is determinate [or a
proper name] and similar in meaning to سَاعَةٌ,
which is fem., meaning that all nouns signifying
times are سَاعَات, (Th, M,) and, accord. to some,
الصَّفَرُ, (Msb,) [The second month of the Arabian
calendar;] the month that is [the next] after ElMoharram (المُحَرَّمُ): (S, M, K:) so called
because in it they used to procure their provision
of corn from the places [in which it was collected,
their granaries having then become empty (صِفْر);
agreeably with the opinion of my learned friend
Mons. Fulgence Fresnel, that it was so called
from the scarcity of provisions in the season in
which it fell when it was first named; for it then
fell in winter: see the latter of the two tables in
p. 1254; and see also نَسِىْءٌ]: or because Mekkeh
was then empty, its people having gone forth to
travel: or, accord. to Ru-beh, because the Arabs
in it made predatory expeditions, and left those
whom they met empty: (M:) or because they
then made predatory expeditions, and left the
houses of the people empty: (Msb in art. جمد:)
