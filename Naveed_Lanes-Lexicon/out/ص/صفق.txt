of the K,) إِذَا مَخَضَتِ النَّاقَةُ صَافَقَتْ, which evidently means When the she-camel is taken with

or with the option of returning. (Mgh.) And it
is said in a trad. (of Ibn-Mes'ood, TA), صَفْقَتَانِ
فِى صَفْقَةٍ رِبًا i. e. Two bargains in a [single]
bargain [are an unlawful gain]: this is of two
kinds: one is the seller's saying to the buyer, “I
sell to thee such a thing for a hundred dirhems on
the condition of thy buying of me this garment,
or piece of cloth, for such a sum: ” the other kind
is his saying, “I sell to thee this garment, or
piece of cloth, for twenty dirhems on the condition of thy selling to me thy commodity for ten
dirhems. ” (O.) And it is said in another trad.,
إِنَّ أَكْبَرَ الكَبَائِرِ أَنْ تُقَاتِلَ أَهْلَ صَفْقَتِكَ i. e. [Verily
the greatest of great sins is] thy fighting those
with whom thou hast made a covenant: because

(TA,) [i. e. the liver,] and which is the part
where the farrier perforates the beast (بَنْقُبُ مِنَ
الدَّابَّةِ) [at the navel, in order that a yellow fluid
may issue forth]: (M, TA:) or the صَفَاق is the
part around the navel, where the farrier performs
the operation above mentioned: (AA, TA:) or
the skin which, when the مَسْك [or hide] is stripped
off, remains cleaving to the belly, and the rending
of which occasions a [rupture termed] فَتْق; so
says As, in the “ Book of the Horse: ” (TA:)
or what is between the جِلْد [or outer skin] and
the مُصْرَان [or intestines into which the food
passes from the stomach]; (ISh, O, K;) com-

(Fr, O, K.) ―
-b2-  [In the TA, in a verse of Aboo-Dhu-eyb describing a bow, to which it seems to
be there applied as an epithet, it is expl. as signifying راجعة; but I think that this is a mistranscription for رَاجِفَةٌ, meaning Quivering. ―

to صِفَاقٌ.]
صَفِيقٌ, applied to a garment, or piece of cloth,
