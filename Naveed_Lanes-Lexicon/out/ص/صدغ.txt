my صُدْغ [or temple] over against his (another
man's) in walking, or going along. (A'Obeyd,
S, O, K *) [See also 3. Accord. to Golius, it
means also I overtook him, and joined myself to
him by his side: but for this explanation he names

but he has app. taken this from a mistranscription
in a copy of the S.]) One says, مَا صَدَغَكَ عَنْ
هٰذَا الأَمْرِ What turned thee away, or back, from
this affair? (As, S, O:) and صَدَعَكَ also: (S and
O in art. صدع:) but the former is the better. (O
in that art.) And اِتَّبَعَ فُلَانٌ بَعِيرَهُ فَمَا صَدَغَهُ i. e.
[Such a one followed his camel, and] he did not
turn him aside: this is said when he has taken
fright, or become refractory, and run away. (As,

صادغهُ i. q. دَارَاهُ [He treated him with
gentleness, or blandishment; soothed, coaxed,
wheedled, or cajoled, him; &c.]: or عَارَضَهُ فِى
المَشْىِ [he went along over against him]: (K:)
Ibn-'Abbád says that صَادَغْتُ الرَّجُلَ means دَارَيْتُهُ:
and he adds, وَهِىَ المُعَارَضَةُ فِى المَشْىِ: (O: [but
the right reading seems to be أَوْ هِىَ:]) accord. to
the A, one says, صَادَغْتُهُ فِى المَشْىِ صُدْغِى لِصُدْغِهِ
[I walked, or went along, with him, my temple
towards his temple]. (TA.) [See also 1, first
sentence.]
صُدْغٌ [The temple; i. e.] the part between the
eye and the ear; (S, O, K;) the part between the
outer angle of the eye and the root (أَصْل) of the
ear; (A, Msb;) the part of the head that slopes
down to the place of attachment of the jaws; as
expl. by AZ, it is [from] the place of juncture
between the لحية [app. a mistranscription for
لَحْى i. e. jaw, agreeably with the explanation
next preceding,] and [the main portion of] the
head, to the part beneath the قَرْن [which is the
temporal ridge]; (TA;) each of what are termed
the صُدْغَانِ: (AZ, A, TA:) ISd mentions also
↓ صُدُغ, as occurring in poetry, and expresses a
doubt whether it be, or be not, peculiar to poetry:
(TA:) and sometimes they said سُدْغٌ, with س:
Ktr says that certain persons of the Benoo-Temeem,
called Bel'ambar [a contraction of Benu-l-'Ambar],
change س into ص [or use these two letters indiscriminately] when followed by any of the
letters ط and ق and غ and خ, whether the latter
be second or third or fourth; saying سِرَاطٌ and
صِرَاطٌ, and بَسْطَةٌ and بَصْطَةٌ, and سَيْقَلٌ and صَيْقَلٌ,
&c.: (S, O:) the pl. is أَصْدَاغٌ (S, O, Msb, TA,
[in all except the Msb mentioned after the signification expl. in the next sentence, and properly
a pl. of pauc.,]) and also أَصْدُغٌ [which is probably used only as a pl. of pauc.]. (TA.) ―
-b2-
And (tropical:)  The hair that hangs down upon the place

صَدَاغٌ A mark made with a hot iron upon the
صُدْغ [or temple, of a camel], (S, O, K, TA,) or,
as in the A, upon the even part of the صُدْغ,
lengthwise. (TA.)
صَدِيغٌ an epithet applied to a child (S, K) In
the stage extending to his completion of seven
days: (S:) or that is seven days old: (Mgh, O,
K:) because his temple becomes firm (يَشْتَدُّ صُدْغُهُ)
only to this period, (so in the O, [and the like is
said in the Mgh,]) or because his temples are not
bound (لَا يُشَدُّ صُدْغَاهُ) save for seven days: (so in
the TA:) or it may be an instance of فَعِيلٌ in the
sense of مَفْعُولٌ from صَدَغَهُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ meaning
“ he turned him away, or back, from the thing. ”
(O.) ―
-b2-  And [hence, perhaps,] Weak. (S, O, K.)
الأَصْدَغَانِ [The two temporal arteries;] two
veins beneath the صُدْغَانِ [or two temples], (O,
K,) which, as is said by As, are always pulsing,
in everyone in the world: a word having no sing.,
like as they say of المِذْرَوَانِ. (O.)
مِصْدَغٌ: see what next follows.
مِصْدَغَةٌ A pillow, or cushion; (S, O, K;) because placed beneath the صُدْغ [or temple]; also
pronounced مِسْدَغَةٌ; and sometimes they said
مِزْدَغَةٌ; (S, O;) and [↓ مِصْدَغٌ and] مِسْدَغٌ and
مِزْدَغٌ signify the same. (TA in art. سدغ.)
مَصْدَّغٌ, and its fem.: see what follows.
مَصْدُوغٌ, A camel marked with the mark termed
صِدَاغ; as also ↓ مُصَدَّغٌ: (K, * TA:) or the former
is applied in this sense to a camel, and ↓ مُصَدَّغَةٌ
in like manner to camels. (ISh, O, TA.)
