crying out, vehemently; [or screaming;] (L, K;)

affliction, or evil accident: (L:) one says, صَرَخَ,
inf. n. صَرْخَةٌ; and ↓ اصطرخ; [He called or called
out, &c.;] both meaning the same. (S.) And
صُرَاخٌ is also an inf. n. of صَرَخَ, (A, Mgh, Msb,)
and signifies The raising the voice, calling or
calling out, crying or crying out: (S, A, L, K:)
or doing so vehemently: (L, K:) and the calling,

regarded as proper; (MF;) as also صَرِيخٌ, (S,
TA,) which is likewise an inf. n. of صَرَخَ: (A,
Mgh:) one says, صَرَخَ, aor.
صَرُخَ (A, MA, Mgh, L,

a crying for aid!] and وَا صَرْخَتَاهْ [Alas, a crying
of alarm!]; (L;) and ↓ استصرخ signifies the
same: (AHát, L:) and ↓ اصطرخوا is syn. with
↓ تصارخوا; (S, TA;) meaning صَرَخُوا; as also
↓ استصرخوا; (TA;) or [rather] meaning They
called or called out, &c., (صَرَخُوا,) one to another.

اصرخ He aided, or succoured, another; in
answer to a call, or cry; (S, A, Mgh, Msb;) as
also ↓ استصرخ: (AHát, L:) the | in the former

أَصْرَخْتُهُ signifies I made his crying, or vehement
crying, &c., to cease: (TA:) and ↓ صَارِخَةٌ has
the signification of the inf. n. of this verb, as an
inf. n. [or rather quasi-inf. n.] of the measure

signification in the Kur xxxvi. 43, as is said in
the Ksh [and by Bd]. (TA.)
