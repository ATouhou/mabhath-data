صلو1
صَلَوْتُهُ, (K,) or صَلَوْتُ الظَّهْرَ, (M,) I struck,
or beat, that part, [of him, or] of the back, which
is called صَلًا: (M:) or I hit that part (M, K)
with a thing, or with an arrow or some other
thing: on the authority of Lh, who says that it is
of the dial. of Hudheyl: and one says also صَلَيْتُهُ;
which is extr. [with respect to derivation], unless
it be an instance of interchangeableness [of و and
ى]. (M.)
-A2-  صَلِيَتْ and صَلَتْ, said of a mare,
or she-camel: see 4.

صلّى, (S, M, K,) quasi-inf. n. صَلَاةٌ or صَلٰوة,
for which one should not say تَصْلِيَةٌ, (S, K,) or
the latter is allowable as agreeable with rule and
as occurring in old poetry, (MF, TA,) He prayed,
supplicated, or petitioned: (S, M, K:) and [particularly] he performed the divinely-appointed act
[of prayer commonly] termed صَلَاة or صَلٰوة. (S.)
Hence, in the Kur [ix. 104], (TA,) وَصَلِّ عَلَيْهِمْ
And pray thou for them. (Msb, TA.) صَلَّى عَلَى
فُلَانٍ means He prayed for such a one, and
praised him. (TA.) And hence the verse of ElAashà cited in art. رسم, conj. 8. (S, Mgh, * TA.)
It is said in a trad., مَنْ دُعِىَ إِلَى وَلِيمَةٍ فَلْيُجِبْ
وَإِلَّا فَلْيُصَلِّ [i. e. Whoso is invited to a banquet, or
a marriage-feast, let him comply, or, if not, let
him pray for the inviter]. (M.) And the saying,
in a verse of El-Aashà, عَلَيْكِ مِثْلَ الَّذِى صَلَّيْتِ
means Keep thou to the like of thy prayer; i. e.
he enjoined her to repeat the prayer for him: or,
as some relate it, عَلَيْكِ مِثْلُ الَّذِى صَلَّيْتِ, meaning
upon thee be the like of that for which thou hast
prayed: (M:) these words he addressed to his
daughter, on the occasion of her saying, “O my
Lord, ward off from my father diseases and pain. ”
(Mgh.) The saying عَبِيدُ فُلَانٍ يُصَلُّونَ [The slaves
of such a one perform the divinely-appointed act
of prayer] means that they have attained to the
age of virility. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  صلّى عَلَيْهِ, said of an
angel, means He prayed for, or begged, forgiveness, or pardon, for him: and thus the verb
sometimes means when said of other than an
angel; as in the trad. of Sowdeh, in which it is
said, إِذَا مِتْنَا صَلَّى لَنَا عُثْمَانُ بْنُ مَظْعُونٍ [When
we die, 'Othmán Ibn-Madh'oon will pray for
forgiveness for us]; he having then died. (TA.)
―
-b3-  [And, said of a man, He blessed him, meaning
he invoked God's blessing upon him; namely, the
Prophet; or he said, اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَيْهِ (expl. by
what here follows) accord. to the rendering of
صَلُّوا عَلَيْهِ, i. e. عَلَى النَّبِىِّ, by Bd and others in
the Kur xxxiii. 56.] One says, صَلَّيْتُ عَلَى النَّبِىِّ
[I blessed the Prophet; &c.]. (S.) ―
-b4-  And, said
of God, He blessed him, meaning He conferred
blessing upon him: and He had mercy on him:
and He magnified him, or conferred honour upon
him: hence the saying, اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى آلِ أَبِى أَوْفَى,
meaning O God, bless the family of Aboo-Owfà:
or have mercy on &c.: but in the saying [in the
Kur xxxiii. 56], إِنَّ اللّٰهَ وَمَلَائِكَتَهُ يُصَلُّونَ عَلَى النَّبِىِّ,
the verb does not import two meanings; for it has
there only one meaning, which is “ magnification ”
[i. e. these words mean Verily God and his
angels magnify the Prophet; or rather I would
render them, bless the Prophet, as this rendering
implies magnification and also a meaning of the
quasi-inf. n. given in the M and K, which is
“ eulogy,” or “ commendation,” bestowed by
God upon his apostle, while it imports God's
“ conferring of blessing ” and the angels' “ invoking thereof ” ]: (Msb, TA:) [it is said that]
اللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ means O God, magnify
Mohammad in the present world by exalting his
renown and manifesting his invitation [to ElIslám] and rendering permanent his law, and in
the world to come by accepting his intercession for
his people and multiplying his reward: and it is
disputed whether or not this form of prayer may
be used for any but the Prophet [Mohammad]:
El-Khattábee says that it may not, though he
himself used it for others. (TA.) [صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ
وَسَلَّمَ is a phrase commonly used by the Muslims
after the mention of their prophet: see art. سلم.
See also صَلَاةٌ below.]
-A2-  صلّى said of a horse,
(S, K,) inf. n. تَصْلِيَةٌ, (TA,) He followed next
after the foremost [in a race, at the goal]. (S,
K.) Hence the saying [in a trad. of 'Alee], سَبَقَ
رَسُولُ اللّٰهِ وَصَلَّى أَبُو بَكْرٍ وَثَلَّثَ عُمَرُ [expl. in art.
سبق]. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  And صلّى الحِمَارُ أُتُنَهُ, (Sgh,
K,) inf. n. تَصْلِيَةٌ, (Sgh, TA,) The [wild] ass
drove together his she-asses, and made them to
take the way [that he would follow]. (Sgh, K,
TA.)

أَصْلَتْ, (T, S, K, TA,) and ↓ صَلِيَتْ, (Fr, K,
TA,) and ↓ صَلَتْ, (Zj, TA,) said of a mare, The
parts on the right and left of her tail, (صَلَوَاهَا, S,)
or the part on either side of her tail, (صَلَاهَا, K,
[see صَلًا, below,]) became relaxed, she being near
to bringing forth: (S, K:) or, said of a she-camel, her young one fell into the part of her
called صَلًا, and she was near to bringing forth.
(T, TA.)
صَلًا The middle of the back of a human being
and of any quadruped: (M, K:) and, (K,) or as
some say, (M,) [app. in a beast,] the part that
slopes down from the hips, or haunches: or the
space intervening between the جَاعِرَة [app. meaning
the hinder projection of the haunch or rump of a
beast] and the tail: (M, K:) or the part on the
right and left of the tail; (S, M, K;) the two
together being called [the] صَلَوَانِ, (S, K,) which
is similarly expl. by Zj in relation to a she-camel;
app. properly meaning the two parts bordering
upon the tail-bone: (TA:) or the place in which
is set the tail of the horse; dual as above: (Msb:)
or the bone upon which are the two buttocks:
(Mgh: [there thus expl. in relation to a man:])
or the bone in which is the place of setting of the
tail-bone; thus expl. by IDrd: or the صَلَوَانِ are
the two bones projecting from the two sides of the
rump: or, accord. to some of the lexicologists,
two veins (عِرْقَانِ) in the place of the رِدْف [i. e. in
the rump]: (Ham p. 46:) the pl. is صَلَوَاتٌ, (M,
K,) an instance of a pl. formed by the addition of
ا and ت from a masc. sing., (M,) and أَصْلَآءٌ. (M,
K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, جِئْتُ فِى أَصْلَائِهِمْ,
meaning I came at their rears. (TA.)
صَلَاةٌ, or صَلٰوة, [accord. to El-Hareeree, to be
written with ا when prefixed to a pronoun, and
also in the dual number, (see De Sacy's Anthol.
Gram. Arabe, p. 67 of the Arabic text,) but this
rule I have not found to be generally observed,
even in the best MSS., nor have I in the similar
case of حَيٰوةٌ, (to which it is also applied,) in the best
copies of the Kur-án,] is said to be [originally
صَلَوَةٌ,] of the measure فَعَلَةٌ, (Mgh, MF, TA,) or,
accord. to some, [صَلْوَةٌ,] of the measure فَعْلَةٌ:
(MF, TA:) it is a quasi-inf. n. of صَلَّى [q. v.]:
(S, K:) and [used as a simple subst.] it signifies
Prayer, supplication, or petition: (S, M, Msb,
K:) this is said to be its primary signification:
and ↓ مُصَلًّى is said to have the same meaning.
(Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  Then applied to signify A certain
well-known mode, or manner, [of religious service,]
because comprising prayer; (Msb;) [the divinelyappointed act of prayer;] one of the divinelyappointed صَلَوَات; (S;) a certain religious service
in which are رُكُوع [or lowering of the head so
that the palms of the hands reach the knees] and
سُجُود [or prostration of oneself in a particular
manner expl. voce سَجَدَ]: (M, * K:) and ↓ مُصَلًّى
is said to have the same meaning. (TA.) [The
performance of this act is fully described in my
work on the Modern Egyptians.] It is said to be,
in this sense, a proper term of the law, not indicated by the language of the Arabs [before
El-Islám] except as importing prayer, which is its
primary signification: what Esh-Shiháb says respecting it necessarily implies its being a proper
term of the law known to the Arabs [before ElIslám]: in the Mz it is said to be one of the words
of El-Islám: but all of these sayings require consideration. (MF, TA, [Much more, which I
omit as being unprofitable, is added on this point
in the TA, partly from the Msb; as well as
several different opinions respecting the derivation
of the word as used in this sense, which are fanciful
or absurd.]) The saying of the Prophet, لَا صَلٰوةَ
لِجَارِ المَسْجِدِ إِلَّا فِى المَسْجِدِ means There is no
صلوة [or divinely-appointed act of prayer] that
is excellent or complete [to the neighbour of the
mosque unless in the mosque]. (M.) And his
saying, to Usámeh, الصَّلٰوةُ أَمَامَكَ means The time
of the صلوة [or divinely-appointed prayer], or the
place thereof, [is before thee,] alluding to that of
sunset. (Mgh.) And he used the term الصَّلٰوةُ as
meaning سُورَةُ الصَّلٰوةِ, i. e. The فَاتِحَة [or Opening
Chapter of the Kur-án, because it is a form of
prayer, or] because the recital thereof is excellent,
or satisfactory. (Mgh.) In the Kur xxii. 41,
(I' Ab, S, M, Ksh, Bd,) [the pl.] صَلَوَاتٌ means
Places of worship of the Jews: (I' Ab, S, M,
Ksh, Bd, K:) said to be (Ksh, Bd) originally
صَلُوتَا, a Hebrew word, (Ksh, Bd, K,) arabicized:
(Ksh, Bd:) this is the common reading of the
word, and the most valid: other readings are
صُلُوَاتٌ and صُلَوَاتٌ and صِلَوَاتٌ; and beside these,
some others which are perverted forms. (TA.)
―
-b3-  Also Prayer for forgiveness or pardon. (M,
Mgh, K.) ―
-b4-  [And A blessing, as meaning an invocation of God's blessing upon any one. See 2.]
―
-b5-  And i. q. بَرَكَةٌ [as meaning A blessing, such
as is bestowed by God]: (Msb:) and mercy (S,
M, Mgh, Msb, K) of God (S, M) on his apostle:
(M:) and magnification; and this is [said to be]
specially denoted by its verb when the Prophet is
the object: (Msb:) and God's eulogy, or commendation, bestowed upon his apostle. (M, K.)
-A2-  الصَّلَاةُ [from صَلًا] also means إِتْيَانُ المَرْأَةِ فِى
دُبُرِهَا. (TA in art. صوم.)
مُصْلِيَةٌ part. n. of أَصْلَتْ [q. v.] said of a she-camel [or of a mare]. (T, TA.)
مُصَلًّى A place of الصَّلَاة [as meaning the performance of the divinely-appointed act of prayer];
(Mgh, Msb, K;) or of any prayer or supplication: (Mgh:) [and particularly] a place of the
performance of the divinely-appointed prayer on
the occasion of the [festival termed] عِيد: (MA:)
[and also such a place at a burial-ground: the
place for this purpose is particularly termed
مُصَلَّى الأَمْوَاتِ: see De Sacy's Chrest. Arabe,
sec. ed., i. 192.] ―
-b2-  And A carpet upon which one
performs the divinely-appointed act of prayer.
(MA.) ―
-b3-  See also صَلَاةٌ, former half, in two
places.
مُصَلٍّ Any one praying [in any manner: and
particularly performing the divinely-appointed act
of prayer]. (TA.)
-A2-  And المُصَلَِّى signifies, as
applied to a horse, The one that follows next after
the foremost [at the goal] (S, M, Mgh, Msb) in a
race: (Mgh, Msb:) because his head is next to
the part called صَلًا, (Lh, S, M, Msb,) or next to
the صَلَوَانِ, (Mgh,) of the foremost. (Lh, S, M,
Mgh, Msb.)
