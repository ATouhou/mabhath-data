(TA:) the صَوْمَعَة of the Christians is thus called
because it is slender in the head; (S, O, K;) or
because contracted; (Msb;) or, as As says, from
the epithet أَصْمَعُ, meaning [that it is] pointed at

or, applied to a she-goat, whose ear is like that of

best of the feathers of a bird. (O.) ―
-b6-  Applied to
a plant, it means Having fruit come forth that
