صنبرQ. 1
صَنْبَرَتِ النَّخْلَةُ The palm-tree became
solitary, or apart from others: (M:) or became
slender in its lower part, and bared of the stumps
of its branches, and scanty in its fruit. (M, K.)
And صَنْبَرَ أَسْفَلُ النَّخْلَةِ The lower part of the
palm-tree became slender, and stripped of the
external parts [or of the stumps of the branches].
(AO, and S in art. صبر, and TA.)
صَنْبَرٌ, (K, TA,) or ↓ صُنْبُورٌ, (O,) [both probably
correct,] Anything slender and weak, (O, K, TA,)
of animals and of trees [&c.]: (O, TA:) [the reg.
pl. of the former is صَنَابِرُ: and hence, app.,] ―
-b2-
↓ صَنَابِرُ signifies Slender arrows; (T, M;) accord.
to IAar: [ISd says,] I have not found it save on
his authority; and he has not mentioned a sing.
thereof: (M:) [but] accord. to the T, they are so
called as being likened to the صَنَابِر [a pl. of صُنْبُورٌ]
of the palm-tree: (TA:) occurring in this sense in
a verse cited voce ذِلَّةٌ. (IAar, T, M.)
صِنْبِرٌ, and صِنَبْرٌ, and الصِّنَبْرُ: see صِنَّبْرٌ.
صَنْبَرَةٌ Ground that has become rough by reason
of urine and of dung, or compacted dung, of oxen
or sheep &c., (K, TA,) and the like. (TA.) ―
-b2-
أَخَذْتُ الشَّىْءَ بِصَنْبَرَتِهِ and بِصِنْبِرَتِهِ and بِصَنْوَبِرِهِ
[which last is evidently, I think, a mistranscription
for ↓ بِصَنَوْبَرِهِ] is a saying mentioned by Ibn-
'Abbád as meaning I took the thing altogether.
(O.)
صِنَّبْرٌ, (S, in art. صبر, M, O, K,) originally
↓ صِنَبْرٌ, (O,) Cold, as a subst.; (M, O;) as also
صِنِّبْرٌ: (O:) or cold clouds: (IDrd, O:) or a cold
wind (M, K) with mist or clouds: (M:) occurring in a verse of Tarafeh with kesr to the ب:
(M:) [see also صُنْبُورٌ:] or صِنَّبِرٌ, occurring in that
verse, signifies the intense cold of winter; (S in
art. صبر;) as also ↓ صَنَابِرُ, (S, K,) of which the
sing. is ↓ صُنْبُورٌ. (TA.) On the expression of
Tarafeh, حِينَ هَاجَ الصِّنَّبِرْ, [when the cold wind,
with mist, rises,] ending a verse, IJ says that the
poet means الصِّنَّبْرُ; but requiring to make the ب
movent, he transfers to it the final vowel, as in the
phrases هٰذَا بَكُرْ and مَرَرْتُ بِبَكِرْ: he should therefore have said الصِّنَّبُرْ; but regarding the expression as meaning حِينَ هَيْجِ الصِّنَّبْرِ, he makes the
ب to be with kesr, as though he transferred to it
the kesreh of the ر: this, he adds, is more probable than the opinion that the change is merely
one of poetic necessity. (M.) For this last reason,
another poet uses the word with teshdeed to the ن
and ر, and with kesr to the ب; saying,
نُطْعِمُ الشَّحْمَ وَالسَّدِيفَ وَنَسْقِى الْ
مَحْضَ فِى الصِّنَّبِرِّ وَالصُّرَّادِ
[We give to eat fat and the hump of the camel,
and we give to drink pure milk, in the time of
cold wind and chill mist]. (K.) ―
-b2-  Also الصِّنَّبْرُ,
(M, K,) or ↓ الصِّنَبْرُ, (as in two copies of the S in
art. صبر,) and صِنَّبْرٌ, [without the article ال, occurring in a verse of which the metre requires it to be
thus written, with teshdeed to the ن,] (TA,) One,
(S,) namely, the second, (M, K,) of the days called
أَيَّامُ العَجُوزِ: (S, M, K: [see عَجُوزٌ:]) الصِّنَبْرُ [or
الصِّنَّبْرُ] and الصِّنَّبِرُ may have the same meaning,
[or meanings, or may both be applied to the day
above mentioned, for the application of صِنَّبْرٌ to
that day is certain;] poetic necessity requiring
the ب to be movent. (S.) ―
-b3-  صِنَّبِرٌ has also two
contr. significations, namely, Hot: and cold:
accord. to Th, on the authority of IAar. (M.)
You say غَدَاةٌ صِنَّبِرٌ, (M,) or صِنَّبْرٌ, (K,) and ↓ صِنْبِرٌ,
(as in a copy of the M,) or صِنِّبْرٌ, (K,) A cold
morning: (M, K:) and a hot morning. (K.)
صُنْبُورٌ A solitary palm-tree, apart from others,
(AO, S in art. صبر, and M, A in art. صبر, and
K,) the lower part of which becomes slender, (S
and A in art. صبر,) and stripped of the external
parts [or the stumps of the branches]: (S ubi
suprà:) and a palm-tree slender in its lower part,
and bared of the stumps of its branches, and
scanty in its fruit; (M, K;) as also ↓ صُنْبُورَةٌ:
(M:) and a palm-tree that comes forth from the
root, or lower part, of another palm-tree, without
being planted: (M:) or a little palm-tree that
does not grow from its mother-tree: (Ibn-Sim'án:)
and the lowest part of a palm-tree, (AHn, Ibn-Sim'án, M, K,) from which the roots branch off:
(AHn, M:) and branches that come forth from
the lowest part of a palm-tree: (M, K:) or a
branch that comes forth from the trunk of a palmtree, not from the ground: this is [said to be] the
original signification: (T, TA:) or branches that
come forth from the trunk of a palm-tree, not
having their roots in the ground: such branches
weaken the mother-tree, which is cured by pulling
them off: the pl. is صَنَابِيرُ (IAar) and ↓ صَنَابِرُ:
(T, TA:) and the صَنَابِير are also called رَوَاكِيبُ
and عِقَّانٌ. (Ibn-Sim'án.) ―

(M, TA,) or they called him صُنْبُورٌ, (O,) meaning
that he had no offspring nor brother, so that, when
he should die, his name would be lost; (M, TA;)
likening him to a [solitary] palm-tree, of which
the lower part had become slender, and the
branches few, and which had become dry;
(AO;) or to a branch growing from the trunk
of a palm-tree. (TA.)

green in winter and summer, (M,) the fruit of

app. a mistranscription], and the leaves whereof
are [of the kind called] هَدَب [q. v.]: (Mgh:) or
the fruit [i. e. the cone] (S, M, K) of that tree,
(S,) [i. e.] of the أَرْز; (M, K;) the trees being
