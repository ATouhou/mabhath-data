صه1
صَهَّ القَوْمَ He chid the people or party [app.
saying to them صَهْ: see what next follows].
(TA.)
R. Q. 1
صَهْصَهَ بِهِمْ He silenced them, saying
to them صَهْ صَهْ: (K, TA:) and they said also
صَهْصَيْتُ [for صَهْصَهْتُ], like as they said دَهْدَيْتُ
for دَهْدَهْتُ. (TA.)
صَهْ, as also صَهٍ, (S, IAth, K,) and صَهِ, and صَهًا,
(TA,) a word used in chiding the person [or
persons] to whom it is said, (K, TA,) thus in the
M, or rather (TA) it is a verbal noun, (S, IAth,
TA,) used in commanding silence, (S, TA,)
meaning Be silent, (S, IAth, K, TA,) addressed
to a single person, and to two persons, and to a
pl. number, and to a male, and to a female:
(IAth, TA:) and one says also صَهٍ صَهْ: Mbr
says, if you say, صَهٍ يَا رَجُلُ [Be silent, O man],
it is to distinguish between that which is determinate and that which is indeterminate; صَهٍ being
indeterminate: (S, TA:) [i. e.,] as IJ says, the
saying صَهٍ, with tenween, is as though you said
سُكُوتًا; and when you pronounce it without tenween, it is as though you said السُّكُوتَ: or, as
IAth says, when with tenween, it is as though
you said, اُسْكُتْ سُكُوتًا; and when without tenween,
as though you said, اُسْكُتِ السُّكُوتَ المَعْرُوفَ مِنْكَ.
(TA.)
