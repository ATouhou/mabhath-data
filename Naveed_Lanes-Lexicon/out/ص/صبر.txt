صبر1
صَبَرَهُ, aor.
صَبِرَ, (S, M, A, K,) inf. n. صَبْرٌ, (M,
K,) He confined him; held him in custody;
detained, retained, restrained, or withheld, him,
or it; (S, M, A, K;) عَنْهُ from it. (M, A, K.)
[Accord. to a copy of the A, ↓ صبّرهُ signifies the
same; but this may be a mistranscription.
Hence,] صَبَرْتُ نَفْسِى I restrained, or withheld,
myself, or my soul; (S, Mgh;) عَلَى كَذَا [to
endure such a thing]. (Mgh.) 'Antarah says,
mentioning a battle in which he was engaged,
فَصَبَرْتُ عَارِفَةً لِذٰلِكَ حُرَّةً
تَرْسُوا إِذَا نَفْسُ الجَبَانِ تَطَلَّعُ
meaning حَبَسْتُ نَفْسًا صَابِرَةً [i. e. And I restrained
thereat a soul patient and ingenuous, that is firm
when the soul of the coward yearns: the last
word (for تَتَطَلَّعُ) I have here rendered on the
supposition that the poet describes the soul of the
coward as one that is yearning for home]. (S.)
[And hence,] صَبَرَ is also used intransitively:
(Msb:) [or as a trans. verb of which the objective
complement, namely, نَفْسَهُ, is understood:] you
say, صَبَرَ, aor. and inf. n. as above, (S, M, Msb,
K,) He was, or became patient, or enduring;
contr. of جَزِعَ: (M, K:) or he restrained, or
withheld, himself, or his soul, from impatience:
(S, Msb:) or he restrained, or withheld, himself,
or his soul, from impatience, and his tongue from
complaint, and his members from broil: or,
accord. to Dhu-n-Noon, he shunned acts of opposition, and was calm in suffering the pangs of
afflictions, and made a show of competence in a
state of protracted poverty in places where the
means of subsistence were found: or, as some say,
he endured trial, or affliction, with good manners:
or he was contented in trial, or affliction, without
show of complaint: or he constrained himself to
attempt things that he disliked: or, accord. to
'Amr Ibn-'Othmán, he maintained constancy with
God, and received his trials with an unstraitened
mind: or, accord. to El-Khowwás, he steadily
adhered to the statutes of the Kur-án and the
Sunneh: or, as some say, he was content to
perish for gaining the approval of him whom he
loved: or, accord. to El-Hareeree, he made no
difference between a state of ease, comfort, and
affluence, and a state of affliction; preserving
calmness of mind in both states: (B:) and you
also say ↓ اِصْطَبَرَ, (S, M, Msb, K,) and ↓ اِصَّبَرَ, (S,
M, K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously, اصْبَرَّ,])
changing the ط into ص, but not اِطَّبَرَ, for ص is not
to be incorporated into ط; (S;) and likewise
↓ تصبّر; (M, K;) both syn. with صَبَرَ; (M;) or
↓ تصبّر signifies he constrained himself to be patient;
(S, TA;) [or he took patience: and ↓ اصطبر, he
acquired patience; and he was tried with patience:
see صَابِرٌ.] One says, صَبَرَ فُلَانٌ عِنْدَ المُصِيبَةِ Such
a one was patient on the occasion of affliction.
(S.) And صَبَرْتُ عَلَى مَا أَكْرَهُ [I was patient of,
or I endured with patience, or bore with, what
I dislike]. (A.) And صَبَرْتُ عَمَّا أُحِبُّ [I endured
with patience the withholding of myself, or the
being debarred, from what I love, or like; or I
was patient of the loss, or want, of what I love,
or like]: (A:) and عَنْهُ ↓ تَصَبَّرْتُ [I constrained
myself to endure with patience the withholding
myself, or the being debarred, from it, or him;
or I constrained myself to be patient of the loss,
or want, of it, or him]. (L, voce تَجَلَّدَ.) And
↓ أَفْضَلُ الصَّبْرِ التَّصَبُّرُ [The most excellent kind of
patience is the constraint of oneself to be patient]:
a saying of 'Omar. (IAar.) And بَدَنِى لَا يَصْبِرُ
عَلَى البَرْدِ (tropical:)  [My body will not be patient of cold,
or will not endure patiently cold]. (A.) And
صَبْرٌ signifies also The being bold or daring [in
enduring, or attempting, a thing]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also
He made him, or it, firm, or fast; or bound, or
tied, him, or it, firmly, or fast. (TA.) [Hence,]
صَبَرَهُ عَلَى القَتْلِ, inf. n. as above, He confined
him, namely, a man, and other than man, [with
bonds or otherwise,] (K, TA,) alive, (TA,) and
shot, or cast, at him until he died: (K, TA:) or
he set him up for slaughter: (M:) and you say
also, قَتَلَهُ صَبْرًا; (S, M, Msb, K;) and صَبَرَهُ;
meaning he confined him (i. e. a man) to die,
until he died; and in like manner you say ↓ اصبرهُ;
(S;) which latter signifies also he slew him in
retaliation. (T in art. بوأ.) And قُتِلَ صَبْرًا He
(i. e. any living thing) was confined alive, and
then shot at, or cast at, until he was put to death:
(S:) or he (any living thing) was bound until he
was put to death: (Msb:) or he (a man) was
bound hand and foot, or held by another man,
until he was beheaded: (Mgh:) or he was slain
[deliberately,] not on the field of battle, nor in
war or fight, nor by mistake: (A 'Obeyd:) and
صُبِرَ he was confined, (A,) or held and confined,
(B,) to be put to death. (A, B.) صَبْرُ الرُّوحِ [signifies The confining the living, and shooting, or
casting, at him until he dies; as is shown in the
TA: but it] occurs in a trad., in which it is forbidden, as meaning the act of gelding, or castrating. (A, TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, (S, Msb,) aor. and inf. n.
as above, (Msb,) He confined him to make him
swear, until he swore, or took an oath; as also
↓ اصبرهُ: (S:) or he made him to swear a most
energetic oath; (Msb;) as also صَبَرَ يَمِينَهُ, (A,
Mgh,) which is a tropical phrase: (A:) and
↓ اصبرهُ, (TA in art. بلت,) or عَلَى يَمِينٍ ↓ اصبرهُ,
(TA in the present art.,) he (the judge, or
governor,) constrained him to swear, or take an
oath. (TA.) And صُبِرَ He was confined, or held
in custody, in order that he might be made to
swear, or take an oath. (A.) And حَلَفَ صَبْرًا He
swore, or took an oath, being confined, or held in
custody, (S, M,) by the judge, or governor, (M,)
in order that he might be made to do so. (S, M.)

-A4-
صَبَرُوا طَعَامَهُمْ, (so in the CK, [agreeably with
an explanation of the pass. part. n. مَصْبُورٌ, q. v.,])
or ↓ صَبَّرُوهُ, (so in the M, and in my MS. copy of
the K, [both probably correct,]) They collected
their wheat together without measuring or weighing it; made it a صُبْرَة [q. v.] (M, K.)
2
صبّرهُ, (M, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَصْبِيرٌ, (TA,)

K:) and the first, he required of him that he
should be patient: (Sgh, TA:) and ↓ اصبرهُ, he

-A4-  Also He
ballasted a ship: used in this sense in the present
day. See صَابُورَةٌ.]
3
صابرهُ, (A, MA,) inf. n. مُصَابَرَةٌ (A, K) and
صِبَارٌ, (K,) [He vied with him in patience, or
endurance; as shown in what follows: or] he
acted patiently with him: (MA:) صَابِرُوا in the
Kur iii. last verse means Vie ye in patience, or
endurance: (Ksh, Bd, Jel: *) or in this instance,
in the saying اِصْبِرُوا وَصَابِرُوا وَرَابِطُوا, the three
verbs are progressive in meaning; the first meaning less than the second; and the second, less than
the third: or the meaning is, [be ye patient] with
yourselves, and [vie ye in patience] with your
hearts in enduring trial with respect to God, and
[remain ye steadfast] with your minds in desire
for God: or [be ye patient] with respect to God,
and [vie ye in patience] with God, and [remain
ye steadfast] with God. (B, TA.) [See also 3 in

swearer is compelled to take, (Mgh, K,) he being
confined by the Sultán until he do so: (Mgh, *
TA:) such an oath is also termed ↓ يَمِينٌ مَصْبُورَةٌ:
(Mgh:) [i. e.] the term مَصْبُورَةٌ is applied to an
oath, (S, K, TA,) meaning one on account of
which a man is confined, in order to make him
swear it; (TA; [and this seems to be indicated
by the context in the S and K;]) but the man
being مَصْبُور, and not the oath, the latter is thus

صُبَارَةٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ صَبَارَةٌ and ↓ صِبَارَةٌ (K)

(M, K.) A poet says, (S,) namely, El-Aashà,
(M,) or 'Amr Ibn-Milkat Et-Tá-ee, addressing
'Amr Ibn-Hind, who had a brother slain, (IB,)
مَنْ مُبْلِغٌ عَمْرًا بِأَنَّ المَرْءَ لَمْ يُخْلَقْ صُبَارَهْ
(so in the S; but in the M and TA this verse is
given differently, with شَيْبَانَ and أَنَّ in the places
of عَمْرًا and بِأَنَّ; and it is said in the M that
accord. to one relation the last word is صِيَارَهْ,
[with ى,] which, it is added, is like صُبَارَه in
meaning;) [i. e. Who will tell 'Amr, or Sheybán,
that man was not created stones?] but IB says
that the last word is correctly صِبَارَهْ, with kesr to
the ص; and the poet means, man is not stone,
that he should patiently endure the like of this:
(TA:) [J says,] accord. to one relation, the last
word is صَبَارَهْ, with fet-h, which is pl. of ↓ صَبَارٌ,
the صَبَارٌ being affixed to denote its being a pl. pl.,
for صَبْرَةٌ is pl. of ↓ signifying strong, or hard,
stones: [and he adds,] El-Aashà says,
↓ قُبَيْلَ الصُّبْحِ أَصْوَاتُ الصَّبَارِ
(S:) but IB says that صَبَارٌ and صَبَارَةٌ are not pls.
of صَبْرَةٌ; for فَعَالٌ is not a pl. form, but فِعَالٌ, with
kesr, like حِجَارٌ and جِبَالٌ: (TA:) [and it is said
that] the verse from which this is cited is not by
El-Aashà, and is correctly and completely as
follows:
كَأَنَّ تَرَنُّمَ الهَاجَاتِ فِيهَا
قُبَيْلَ الصُّبْحِ أَصْوَاتُ الصِّيَارِ
by الصيار being meant the صَنْج, (TS, K, TA,)
