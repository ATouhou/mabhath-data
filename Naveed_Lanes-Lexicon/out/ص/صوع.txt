صوع1
صُعْتُهُ, (O, K,) [from صَاعَهُ,] aor. أَصُوعُهُ,
(K,) inf. n. صَوْعٌ, (TA,) I measured it with the
صَاع [q. v.]. (O, K.) One says, هٰذَا طَعَامٌ يُصَاعُ
i. e. [This is wheat] that is measured [with the
صاع]. (O.) ―
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  [I collected it together,
like as the measurer collects the corn &c. in the
measure: and the contr., i. e.] I dispersed it, or
scattered it; (S, O, K;) in which sense it is [said
to be] tropical; (TA;) and صِعْتُهُ, aor. أَصِيعُهُ, (K
in art. صيع,) inf. n. صَيْعٌ, (TA in that art.,)
signifies the same. (K in that art.) One says,
صُعْتُ الأَقْرَانَ, and غَيْرَهُمْ, (tropical:)  I came to the antagonists, and others, from their sides: (K, TA:)
of a courageous man, or a courageous armed man,
one says, يَصُوعُ أَقْرَانَهُ (tropical:)  He comes to his antagonists from their sides; (S, O, TA;) and the like
is cited in the T from Lth; or as meaning he
encompasses their sides; (TA;) or he collects
together his antagonists (IKtt, Z, TA) from every
side, (IKtt, TA,) like as the measurer collects
together that which is measured: (Z, TA:) and of
a man, (S, O,) or a pastor, (Lth, IKtt, Z,) يَصُوعُ
الإِبِلَ, (S, O,) or مَاشِيَتَهُ, (Lth,) or إِبِلَهُ, (IKtt, Z,)
(tropical:)  He comes [to the camels or] to his cattle [or to
his camels] from their sides; or he encompasses
their sides; (Lth, TA;) or he collects them together (IKtt, Z, TA) from every side, (IKtt,
TA,) like as the measurer collects together that
which is measured: (Z, TA:) but Az says that the
foregoing explanations by Lth are wrong; that
يَصُوعُ أَقْرَانَهُ, said of a courageous man, or a
courageous armed man, means he charges upon his
antagonists and disperses them; and يَصُوعُ إِبِلَهُ,
said of a pastor, he disperses his camels in the
place of pasture; and يَصُوعُ المَعَزَ, said of a hegoat, he disperses the [she-] goats; and صَاعَ الغَنَمَ,
aor. as above, and so the inf. n., he dispersed the
sheep or goats; (TA;) and الغَنَمَ ↓ اصاع, inf. n.
إِصَاعَةٌ, signifies thus likewise: (Lh, TA in art.
صيع:) Lh also says that صُعْتُ الغَنَمَ, aor. أَصُوعُهَا,
inf. n. صَوْعٌ, and صِعْتُهَا, aor. أَصِيعُهَا, inf. n. صَيْعٌ,
both signify I dispersed the sheep or goats: (O in
art. صيع:) or, accord. to IKtt, صاع إِبِلَهُ, said of
a pastor, has two contr. meanings; he collected
together his camels from every side; and also he
dispersed his camels. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also I frightened
him. (Ibn-'Abbád, * O, * K.) ―
-b4-  And صُعْتُ القَوْمَ,
aor. أَصُوعُهُمْ, (Lh, O in art. صيع,) inf. n. صَوْعٌ,
(TA in that art.,) I urged, or incited, the people,
or party; (Lh, O and TA in that art.;) and so
صِعْتُ القَوْمَ, (Lh, O and K in that art.,) aor.
أَصِيعُهُمْ, (Lh, O ibid.,) inf. n. صَيْعٌ. (TA ibid.) ―
-b5-
―
-b6-  [And صاع الكُرَةَ He propelled the ball with the
صَوْلَجَان. (See صَاعٌ below, last sentence.)] ―

بَعْضُهَا بَعْضًا,] aor. تَصُوعُ, (O,) inf. n. صَوْعٌ, (TA,)

another. (O, K.) ―
-b8-  And صاع الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. صَوْعٌ,
He folded, or doubled, the thing; twisted it; or
bent it. (IKtt, TA.)

She (a woman) prepared a place, such as is
termed صَاعَة, (O, K, TA,) and made it even,

up, or caused to dry up, the plants, or herbage;
(O, K;) as also صَوَّحَتْهُ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  صوّع الشَّىْءَ
He made the thing pointed in its head. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.) ―

sides. (O, K.) ―
-b5-  صّوع, (K,) inf. n. as above,
(O,) said of an ass, [meaning a wild ass,] He
drove his she asses to the right and left: (O, K:)
so expl. by Ibn-'Abbád. (O.) And, said of a
horse, He went at random, and resisted his owner
[or rider]. (TA.) ―
-b6-  صوّع إِلَيْهِ [said of a man, as
is indicated in the O,] He turned about his head
towards him: and he turned his face towards him.
(O, TA.) ―
-b7-  And صوّع رَأْسَهُ, said of a bird, It
moved, or moved about, its head. (TA.)

تصوّع It became dispersed, or scattered; as
also ↓ انصاع. (S.) You say, تصوّع القَوْمُ The
people, or party, became dispersed, or scattered,
and remote, all of them, one from another. (O,
K.) ―
-b2-  Also, said of hair, It became contracted,
and much split: [app. by reason of dryness: like
تصوّح:] (Lth, O, K:) or it became dispersed, or
scattered; (Lh, O, K;) and it fell off by degrees.
(O, K.) ―
-b3-  And, said of herbage, It became dried
up; (S, O, K;) like تصوّح; (O;) as also تصيّع.
(S; and O and K in art. صيع.)
7
انصاع: see 5. ―
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  He turned away,
or back, retreating, or returning, (S, O, K, TA,)
and went (S, TA) quickly, or hastening: (S, O,
K, TA:) or you say, انصاع القَوْمُ (tropical:)  The people, or
party, went away quickly: and مُدْبِرًا (tropical:)  He
went away [turning back] quickly. (TA.) [See
an ex. voce صَارَّةٌ.] ―
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  It (a bird) ascended,
or mounted, into the air, between the earth and
sky, or into the middle of the sky. (TA in art.
صيع, from the book entitled “ Ghareeb el-
Hamám ” by El-Hasan Ibn-' Abd-Alláh El-Kátib
El-Isbahánee.)
صَاعٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and ↓ صُوعٌ and
↓ صَوْعٌ (O, K) and ↓ صُوَاعٌ (S, O, K) and ↓ صِوَاعٌ,
(O, K,) thus accord. to five different readers of
the Kur in xii. 72, (O, K, * TA,) A certain measure used for measuring corn (& c.], (S, O, Msb,
K,) and upon which turn [or depend] the decisions of the Muslims [relating to measures of
capacity]: (K:) or the صاع is different from the
↓ صُوَاع; (S, K;) the latter being a certain vessel,
in [or from] which one drinks [as will be expl.
hereafter in this paragraph]: (S, TA:) the former
is four أَمْدَاد [pl. of مُدٌّ]; (S, O, Msb, K;) i. e.
(Msb) five أَرْطَال [or pints] and a third, (Mgh,
Msb, TA,) by the measure of Baghdád; (Msb;)
the مُدّ being a pint and a third: (K, TA:) so
with the people of El-Hijáz, (Mgh, TA,) [i. e.]
so with the people of the Harameyn, as was
proved by a number of specimens of the صاع
used in dealings with the Prophet, (Msb,) and
so accord. to Esh-Sháfi'ee: (TA:) but with the
people of El-' Irák it was eight pints, (Mgh, Msb,
TA,) with whom agreed Aboo-Haneefeh; the
مُدّ with them being two pints; (Msb, TA;) but
the addition was made by El-Hajjáj; and their
صاع was the قَفِيز حَجَّاجِىّ, and was unknown to
the people of El-Medeeneh, as is said by Az:
(Msb:) accord. to Ed-Dáwoodee, its invariable
measure is four times the quantity [of corn & c.]
that fills the two hands, that are neither large nor
small, of a man; for the صاع of the Prophet is
not found in every place; and this (the author of
the K says, TA) I have tried, and found to be
correct: (K, TA:) the word is masc. and fem.:
(Zj, Msb, K, TA:) accord. to Fr, the people of
El-Hijáz make it fem.; and Benoo-Asad, except
some of them, make it masc., as do the people of
Nejd; and Zj says that the more chaste way is to
make it masc.: (Msb:) the pl. (of pauc., used
by those who make the sing. fem., O, Msb) is
أَصْوُعٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) for which one may
say أَصْؤُعٌ, (S, O, K, *) changing the و into hemzeh, (S, O,) and accord. to AAF some say آصُعٌ,
like آدُرٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) a pl. of دَارٌ, (Mgh,) but
AHát says that this is a vulgar mistake, (Msb,)
and أَصْوَاعٌ, (O, Msb, K,) which is used by those
who make the sing. masc., (O, Msb,) and [of
mult.] صُوعٌ, (K,) which is app. pl. of ↓ صِوَاعٌ,
with kesr, (TA,) and صِيعَانٌ, (Mgh, O, Msb, K,)
which is [likewise] a pl. of mult., (Msb,) or this
last is pl. of ↓ صُوَاعٌ: and this sing. signifies a
[vessel of the kind called] جَام, [app. here used in
the sense which this word commonly has in Pers.,
i. e. as meaning a cup,] in which, (K, TA,) or
from which, (TA,) one drinks: (K, TA:) Sa'eed
Ibn-Jubeyr says that the صواع of the king [mentioned in the Kur xii. 72] was the Persian مَكُّوك,
of which the two extremities [are compressed so
that they] meet together [app. in such a manner
that the whole vessel resembles a small boat, the
word مكّوك being expl. in several dictionaries as
applied to a drinking-vessel of this form, probably
from the Pers. مَكُّوكْ signifying “ a shuttle ” and
used in this sense in modern Arabic]: El-Hasan
says that the صُوَاع and the سِقَايَة are one thing, as
Zj also says; and that the صواع of the king is said
to have been of وَرِق [meaning silver], and that
they used to measure with it and sometimes they
drank with it: Zj says that it is explained as an
oblong vessel, resembling the مَكُّوك, with which
the king used to drink; and said by some to have
been of مِسّ [which (as is said in the TA in art.
مس) means copper, from the Pers. مِسْ]. (TA.)
[See also صَوْغٌ, with غ.] ―
-b2-  صَاعٌ signifies also
(assumed tropical:)  The place [or plot] in which a صاع [of seed] is
sown: so in a trad. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A depressed
piece of ground; (S, O, K, TA;) as also ↓ صَاعَةٌ;
(O, K, TA;) like an excavation: or, as some say,
a depressed place, sloping down from its surrounding borders: (TA:) or a narrow, depressed place.
(TA in art. طأ.) ―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A place that is swept
and in which one then plays: (Ibn-' Abbád, O,
K:) [see the verse cited in what follows:] and
↓ صَاعَةٌ is said to signify a piece of ground which
a boy sweeps, removing its pebbles, and in which
he plays with the ball: and a bare place, in which
is nothing. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And The place of the breast
of the ostrich when she puts it upon the ground:
(K:) or such a place is called صَاعُ جُؤْجُؤِ النَّعَامِ.
(IF, O.) And one says, ضَرَبَهُ فِى صَاعِ جُؤُجُؤِهِ
and فى صاعِ صَدْرِهِ meaning (tropical:)  He struck him in
the middle of his breast. (Z, TA.)
-A2-  And it is
said that] صَاعٌ also signifies The [kind of goffstick called] صَوْلَجَان. (K.) In the following
verse of El-Museiyab Ibn-' Alas, describing a she-camel,
مَرِحَتْ يَدَاهَا لِلنَّجَآءِ كَأَنَّمَا
تَكْرُو بِكَفَّىْ لَاعِبٍ فِى صَاعِ
[the most obvious meaning of which is, Her
fore legs moved briskly for the purpose of hastening, as though she were propelling a ball with the
hands of a player in a piece of ground cleared for
that exercise,] or, as some relate it, بِكَفَّىْ مَاقِطٍ,
meaning with the hands of a player with the
ball, it is said by some that he means بِصَاعٍ,
[though it is not easy to see why, if so, he did
not say بِالصَّاعِ,] and that by the صاع he means
the صَوْلَجَان, because it is bent (يُعْطَفُ [see 1, last
sentence,]) for the purpose of striking with it, that
the ball may be propelled (تُصَاعُ) with it. (O.)
صَوْعٌ and صُوعٌ: see صَاعٌ, first sentence. ―
-b2-  The
latter is also a pl., (K, TA,) app. of صِوَاعٌ, with
kesr. (TA.)
صُوَعٌ Portions of herbage beginning to dry up.
(Ibn-' Abbád, O, K.) ―
-b2-  And of the flesh of a
horse, Such as is scattered, or sparse; not collected together in one place. (Ibn-' Abbád, O.)
صَاعَةٌ: see صَاعٌ, latter half, in two places. ―
-b2-
Also (tropical:)  A place prepared by a woman for the
separating and loosening of cotton: (Lth, O, K,
TA:) and (assumed tropical:)  a skin, like a نِطْع, which a woman
sometimes makes, or prepares, for the separating
and loosening of cotton and of wool upon it.
(ISh, O, TA.) ―
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A place specially made,
or prepared, for guests. (Z, TA.)
صُوَاعٌ and صِوَاعٌ: see صَاعٌ, former half, in five
places.
أُصَيَّاعٌ occurs as a dim. of صِيعَانٌ [or rather of
أَصْوَاعٌ, pl. of صَاعٌ, regularly formed therefrom].
(IB, TA.)
مُنْصَاعٌ [part. n. of 7] Turning away or back,
retreating, &c. (TA.)
