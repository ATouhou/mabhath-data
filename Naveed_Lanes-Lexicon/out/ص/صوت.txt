صَاتٌ: see صِيتٌ: ―
-b2-  and see also صَيِّتٌ, in two
places.
صَوْتٌ [an inf. n. (see 1): and also a simple
subst., signifying] A sound, (M, MA, TA, PS,)
a noise, a voice, a cry, a shout, an exclamation,
or a vociferation; (MA, PS;) of a human being
and of other things: (ISk, TA:) conventionally,
the sound of speech: (Msb:) [also a tone, considered with regard to the degree of elevation or
depression of the voice:] and any sort of singing:
(M, TA:) [and an air, or a song:] and it is used
to signify a clamour, or confused noise, or mixture
of sounds, (S,) and a cry for aid or succour: (S,
M:) the pl. is أَصْوَاتٌ: (M, Msb, TA:) it is
masc.: (S, * M, Msb, TA:) in the following verse,
(S, M, Msb,) of Ruweyshid Ibn-Ketheer (S, M)
Et-Tá-ee, (S,)
يَا أَيُّهَا الرَّاكِبُ المُزْجِى مَطِيَّتَهُ
سَايِلْ بَنِى أَسَدٍ مَا هٰذِهِ الصَّوْتُ
[O thou, the rider urging on his beast, ask the
sons of Asad what is this clamour?], (S, M,
Msb,) the poet has made الصوت fem. because
meaning thereby. الضَّوْضَآء and الجَلَبَة and الاِسْتِغَاثَة,
(S,) or he has made it fem. as meaning الصَّيْحَة,
(M, Msb,) or الاِسْتِغَاثَة: (M:) the like is often
done by the Arabs, when two words, masc. and
fem., are syn.: thus they say, أَقْبَلَتِ العِشَآءُ,
meaning العَشِيَّةُ; and هٰذَا العَشِيَّةُ, meaning العِشَآءُ:
(Msb:) but the making a masc. n. fem. for this
reason is bad; though the reverse is held to be
allowable. (M.) The Arabs say, أَسْمَعُ صَوْتًا
وَأَرَى فَوْتًا, meaning I hear a sound, or voice, but
I see not a deed. (TA.) بِصَوْتِكَ in the Kur
xvii. 66 is said to mean With the sounds of [thy]
singing, and musical pipes. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-  اِسْمُ
صَوْتٍ is a term applied to A noun significant of a
sound: nouns of this kind being of two classes;
namely, nouns applied to the purpose of addressing
irrational beings, or what are virtually in the
predicament of irrational beings, as young infants; and onomatopœias, or nouns imitative of
sounds: the former class consists of two descriptions of words; namely, ejaculations used for the
purpose of chiding, as هَلَا (to horses) and عَدَسْ
(to mules) and كِخْ كِخْ (to a young infant);
and ejaculations used for the purpose of calling,
as جِىْء (to camels) and تُشَأْ (to an ass): of the
other class are غَاقِ (imitative of the cry of the
crow) and طَقْ (imitative of the sound produced by
the falling of stones) and قبْ (imitative of the
sound produced by the fall of a sword) &c.:
nouns significant of sounds are generally indecl.,
because they resemble certain particles in neither
governing nor being governed; but some of them
are occasionally decl. [like other nouns]. (ElAshmoonee's Expos. of the Alfeeyeh of Ibn-Málik, section اسماء الافعال والاصوات.) ―
-b3-  See
also the next paragraph, in four places.
صِيتٌ (S, M, A, Msb, K) and ↓ صَوْتٌ (S, M, A,
K) and ↓ صَاتٌ (M, K) and ↓ صِيتَةٌ (K) Fame,
report, repute, or reputation, whether good or
evil: (TA:) or good fame, good report, good
repute or reputation, (S, M, Msb, K,) that spreads
(S) among the people; (S, Msb;) so some say;
(TA;) not evil: (S:) [they may often be well
rendered renown:] صِيتٌ is originally صِوْتٌ; the
و being changed into ى on account of the kesreh
preceding it: it seems as though they made it to
be of the measure فِعْلٌ to distinguish between the
صَوْت that is heard and the fame &c. that is
known: but sometimes they said, فِى ↓ اِنْتَشَرَ صَوْتُهُ
النَّاسِ in the sense of صِيتُهُ [i. e. His fame &c., or
good fame &c., spread among the people]: (S,
TA:) and فِى النَّاسِ ↓ لَهُ صَوْتٌ and صِيتٌ [He
has fame &c., or good fame &c., among the
people]: and ذَهَبَ صِيتُهُ فِيهِمْ [His fame &c., or
good fame &c., went among them]. (A.) It
is said in a trad., مَا مِنْ عَبْدٍ إِلَّا لَهُ صِيتٌ فِى السَّمَآءِ,
meaning [There is no servant of God, i. e. no man,
but he has] a report by which he is known [in
Heaven]; and it may be in respect of good and
evil. (TA.) And in another trad., فَصْلُ مَا بَيْنَ
وَالدَّفٌ ↓ الحَلَالِ وَالحَرَامِ الصَّوْتُ [The distinction
between the lawful (i. e. marriage) and the
unlawful (i. e. fornication) is the report that is
made in the case of the former, and the tambourine that is used in that case], meaning the
publication of the marriage, and the going of the
report thereof among the people. (TA.)

―
-b2-  And An artificer, or a handicraftsman; syn.
صَانِعٌ: (K accord. to the TA:) or a goldsmith;
syn. صَائِغٌ. (So in the CK and in my MS. copy
of the K.)
صِيتَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
صَائِتٌ [Sounding; making, producing, emitting,
sending forth, or uttering, a sound, noise, voice,
or cry; (see its verb, صات;)] raising his voice,
calling or calling out, crying or crying out,
shouting, exclaiming, or vociferating; (S, Msb,
TA;) as also ↓ صَيِّتٌ; the two words being like
مَائِتٌ and مَيِّتٌ; the latter originally صَيْوِتٌ.
(TA. [But see the next paragraph: and see also
مِصْوَاتٌ.])
صَيِّتٌ, applied to a man, (S, M, A, Msb, K,)
and ↓ صَاتٌ, so applied, (S, M, K,) and the latter
likewise applied to an ass, (S,) both signify the
same, (K,) Vehement, strong, or loud, of voice:
(S, M, Msb:) ↓ رَجُلٌ صَاتٌ is like رَجُلٌ مَالٌ “ a
man having much property,” and رَجُلٌ نَالٌ “ a
man who gives much,” and كَبْشٌ صَافٌ [“ a ram
having much wool ”], &c., all of these epithets
being originally of the measure فَعِلٌ: (S:) or
صَاتٌ may be of the measure فَاعِلٌ from which
the medial radical has gone; or it may be [originally صَوِتٌ,] of the measure فَعِلٌ. (M.) One says
also صَوْتٌ صَيِّتٌ [A vehement, strong, or loud,
voice]. (A.) See also صَائِتٌ.
صَوَّاتٌ: see مِصْوَاتٌ.
مُصَوِّتٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.
مِصْوَاتٌ One who raises his voice, calls or calls
out, cries or cries out, shouts, clamours, exclaims,
or vociferates; i. q. ↓ مُصَوِّتٌ: (K, TA:) [or, as
also ↓ صَوَّاتٌ, often occurring, who does so much,
or is in the habit of doing so; each being of a
measure denoting intensiveness of the signification.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, مَا بِالدَّارِ مِصْوَاتٌ,
meaning There is not in the house any one (K,
TA) that raises his voice, &c.: in some copies of
the K ↓ مُصَوِّتٌ, which has the same meaning.
(TA.)
مُنْصَاتٌ Straight in stature. (S.)
