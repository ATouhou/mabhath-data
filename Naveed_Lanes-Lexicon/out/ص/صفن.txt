صَافِنٌ A horse standing upon three legs and the
extremity of the hoof of the fourth leg: (A'Obeyd, *
S, TA:) or standing upon three legs, and turning
back the extremity of the fore part of the fourth
hoof, that of his fore leg: (M, TA:) or standing
upon three legs, and otherwise: thus, says Fr, I
have found the Arabs use the word: (TA: [see
1, first sentence:]) pl. صُفُونٌ (M, TA) and صَوَافِنُ
and [the pl. of صَافِنَةٌ is] صَافِنَاتٌ. (TA.) صَافِنَاتٌ
occurs in the Kur xxxviii. 30. (M, TA.) And
in the same, xxii. 37, I'Ab and Ibn-Mes-'ood
used to read صَوَافِنَ [instead of صَوَافَّ]; the
former explaining it as meaning Having the shank
of one fore leg tied up to the arm; for thus is done
with the camel when he is slaughtered: the latter,
as meaning standing, or standing still. (TA.) ―
-b2-
And applied to a man, it means صَافٌّ قَدَمَيْهِ
[setting his feet evenly, side by side], (A'Obeyd,
M, TA, and the like is said in the S and Msb,)
standing. (A'Obeyd, Msb, TA.) It is said in a
trad., (S, M, Msb, TA,) referring to the Prophet
mentioned as praying, (S, M,) قُمْنَا خَلْفَهُ صُفُونًا
[app. meaning We stood behind him setting our
feet evenly, side by side; for so the context seems
to indicate]. (S, M, Msb, K.) [But] in another
trad., صَلٰوةُ الصَّافِنِ is said to be forbidden; meaning [The praying] of him who puts his feet close
together: or, as some say, of him who turns back
his foot [i. e. one of his feet] like as the horse turns
his hoof [i. e. one of his hoofs, when standing upon
three legs]. (TA.)
-A2-  الصَّافِنُ signifies [The saphena, or crural vein; so in the present day;
i. e.] the vein of the سَاق: (S: [see أَبْهَرُ, and see
also النَّسَا:]) or a vein lying deep in the arm
(الذِّرَاع) [and] amid the sinews of the [fore] shank
of a beast: or the صَافِنَانِ are two veins penetrating into the interior of the two shanks: or two
veins in the legs: or two branches [of veins] in
the two thighs: and the صافن is [strangely said
to be] a vein in the interior of the back bone, extending lengthwise, uniting with the نِيَاط [q. v.]
of the heart, also called the أَكْحَل. (M.)
