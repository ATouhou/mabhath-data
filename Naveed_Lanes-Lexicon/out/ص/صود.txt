صود2
صوّد الصَّادَ, inf. n. تَصْوِيدٌ, He wrote the صاد
[i. e. the letter ص]. (K.)
صَادٌ The name of one of the letters of the alphabet. (M, L. [See art. ص.]) ―
-b2-  [It is also The
title of a سُورَة, the thirty-eighth chapter of the
Kur-án.] If you make it a sign of the سورة, you
write it as a single letter, and make it indeclinable
with its last letter quiescent [in pronunciation]:
if you make it a name for the سورة, you write it
as [it is pronounced] in spelling; and say صَادِ,
with kesr, because of the concurrence of two
quiescent letters [in the former case]; and you
may say صَادَ, because this is easier of pronunciation: some make it imperfectly decl., considering
it as fem. [and a proper name]: and some make it
perfectly decl., considering it as masc.; and say,
قَرَأْتُ صَادًا [I read, or recited, the chapter ص]:
and the like is done in the cases of ق [the title of
the fiftieth chapter] and ن [the title of the sixtyeighth chapter]. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  Accord. to ISd, its
medial radical letter is originally و: (L:) accord.
to IJ, it is ى. (MF.)
-A2-  See also art. صيد.
