but in a case of this kind one should not say
اصعد. (L.) And صَعِدَ السَّطْحَ and إِلَى السَّطْحِ
(A, Msb) He ascended, or ascended to, the flat
house-top. (Msb.) And صَعِدَ المَكَانَ, and فِى

الجَبَلِ, (S, A, Msb, K,) and عَلَى الجَبَلِ, inf. n.

(Msb,) disallowed by AZ, (S, TA,) and said by
him to have been unknown, (S,) or unheard,
(K,) but he afterwards authorized it, and it is also
authorized by IAar and ISk, (TA,) and صَعِدَ
الجَبَلَ; (S in art. دخل; [for صَعِدَ فِى الجَبَلِ,

-b2-  And see also 4, in four places.
-A2-  صعّدهُ He made him, or caused him, to ascend,
or mount; syn. عَلَّاهُ; (K and TA in art. علو;)
and رَقَّاهُ; (TA in art. رقى;) [and so ↓ اصعدهُ; and
↓ استصعدهُ; like as one says in the contr. sense

and دَابَّةٌ [He made him to ascend, or mount, a
mountain and a beast]. (TA in art. علو.) And
فِى الجَبَلِ ↓ يُصْعِدُونَهَا is said with reference to
wild bulls or cows [as meaning They make them
to ascend upon the mountain]. (S and TA in art.
سلع.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] one says also, صَعَّدَ فِىَّ النَّظَرَ
وَصَوَّبَهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He looked at me from head to
foot, contemplating me. (L, from a trad. [And
a similar phrase occurs in Har p. 640.]) ―

اصعد فِى المَكَانِ: see 1. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] اصعد
فِى الأَرْضِ He went through the land towards a
land higher than the other [from which he came]:
(A, TA:) taken from the saying of Lth, that
اصعد, inf. n. إِصْعَادٌ, signifies He went towards a
declivity, or a river, or a valley, higher than the
other [from which he came]. (TA.) And اصعد
فِى البِلَادِ He went up, or upwards, through the
countries, or lands. (AA, Msb.) And اصعد
مِنْ بَلَدِ كَذَا إِلَى بَلَدِ كَذَا He journeyed [upwards] from such a region, or town, to such
another region, or town; from one that was lower
to one that was higher. (Msb.) [And hence,]
اصعد, inf. n. إِصْعَادٌ, He journeyed, or went,
towards Nejd, and El-Hijáz, and El-Yemen:
[or towards a higher region:] and اِنْحَدَرَ signifies
“ he journeyed, or went, towards El-'Irák, and
Syria, and 'Omán: ” (ISk, on the authority of
'Omárah:) or the former, he journeyed, or went,
towards the Kibleh: and the latter, “he journeyed, or went, towards El-'Irák: ” (Aboo-
Sakhr, T:) or the former, he came to Mekkeh;
(K;) but this is a defective explanation: (TA:)
and مُصْعَدٌ, also, is used as an inf. n. of this verb;
and مُنْحَدَرٌ, as an inf. n. of انحدر: (T, TA:)
or اصعد, inf. n. إِصْعَادٌ, he commenced a journey,
or went forth; as from Mekkeh, and from ElKoofeh to Khurásán, and the like: (Fr:) or he
commenced a journey, or the like, in any direction:
and انحدر signifies “ he returned, from any
town or country. ” (Ibn-'Arafeh.) And اصعد
فِى الأَرْضِ, (Akh, S, K,) or فى البِلَادِ, (Akh
accord. to the T,) He went away, and journeyed,
through the land, (Akh, S, K,) or through the

(Akh, S, Msb, K;) and ↓ اِصَّعَّدَ, (Lth,) but this
last is disapproved by Az; (TA;) He descended,
or went down, into the valley, (Akh, S, L, Msb,
K,) from the part whence the torrent comes; not
going to the bottom of the valley: and in like
manner, اصعد فِى الأَرْضِ He descended, or went
down, into the land: (L:) and فِى الجَبَلِ ↓ صعّد
He descended the mountain; as well as he ascended it. (IB, L.) Akh cites the following
words of 'Abd-Allah Ibn-Hemmám Es-Saloolee,
طَوْرًا فِى البِلَادِ وَأُفْرِعُ ↓ أُصَعِّدُ
(S, L,) as meaning I descending, or going down,
at one time, through the countries, and [another
time] ascending, or going up: this, says IB, is
what induced Akh to explain صعّد as he has done;
but it presents no proof, because إِفْرَاعٌ has two
contr. significations, that of إِصْعَادٌ and that of
اِنْحِدَارٌ: and accord. to AZ, by أُصَعِّدُ the poet
means I ascending, or going up, to high places;
and by أُفْرِعُ, the contrary. (L.) ―

signifies He advanced towards another. (L.) ―

as is termed صَعُود. (IAar, S, L, K.)

as an epithet. (TA.)
صُعُدٌ an inf. n. of صَعِدَ [q. v.]. (Ham p. 407.)
[Hence,] ذَهَبَ السَّهْمُ صُعُدًا [The arrow went
upwards]. (A.) And هٰذَا النَّبَاتُ يَنْمِى صُعُدًا
This plant increases in height. (S.) And تَنَفَّسَ

-b2-  And A she-ass: (L,
K:) or a long-backed she-ass: (L:) or long [in
the back], applied to a she-ass as an epithet, and

(Ham p. 385.) And بَنَاتُ صَعْدَةَ Wild asses: (S,
K:) said to be so called from صَعْدَةُ meaning as
expl. above; and if this be correct, it is like the
appellation بَنَاتُ البَرِّ: (Ham p. 22:) or as being
likened to the women [or rather woman (as will
be shown in what follows)] termed صعدة; and in
like manner, أَوْلَادُ صَعْدَةَ: (Har p. 471:) the
rel. n. [applied to a single wild ass] is ↓ صَاعِدِىٌّ,
(S, L, K,) irregularly formed: thus in the saying
of Aboo-Dhu-eyb,
فَرَمَى فَأَلْحَقَ صَاعِدِيًّا مِطْحَرًا

the spears. (A.) ―
-b4-  [Hence,] جَارِيَةٌ صَعْدَةٌ (tropical:)  A
girl, or young woman, straight in figure, (A, L,)
like a spear, or spear-shaft: (L:) pl. جَوَارٍ صَعْدَاتٌ,

difficulty: (L:) a long breathing: (K:) or a
prolonged breathing: (S:) or a loud breathing:
(A:) accord. to some, a breathing emitted

upwards: (K, TA:) and أَخَذْتُهُ بِدِرْهَمٍ فَصَاعِدًا
(tropical:)  I got it for a dirhem and upwards; an elliptical
phrase, for أَخَذْتُهُ بِدِرْهَمٍ فَزَادَ الثَّمَنُ صَاعِدًا I got
it for a dirhem and the price increased upwards,
or ذَهَبَ صَاعِدًا went upwards: you may not say
وَصَاعِدًا, because you do not mean to tell that the
dirhem with something more made the price, as
when you say بِدِرْهَمٍ وَزِيَادَةٍ; but you mention the
lowest price that you offered, and mean that you
then offered more and more. (Sb, L.) And
