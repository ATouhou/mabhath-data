the صَرِيف of the door, (M, K,) and of the writingreed (M, Msb) and the like, (M,) is a creaking, or
grating; (M, Msb, * K;) and so that of the tush
of the camel: (K: [ونابُ البَعِيرِ in the CK is a
mistake for ونابِ البعير:]) one says of a man, and
of a camel, صَرَفَ بِنَابِهِ, (M, TA,) and صَرَفَ نَابَهُ,
(TA,) aor.
صَرِفَ, inf. n. صَرِيفٌ, He grated his canine
tooth [against its opposite] so as to cause a sound
to be heard: (M, TA:) the صَرِيف of the stallioncamel is [indicative of] his threatening: (M:)

of the he-camel, his lust: (IKh, TA:) or the
صَرِيف of the stallion is from briskness, liveliness,

65 and 105, and xlvi. 26]. (O, K.) ―
-b2-  It signifies
also The deriving one word from another [by
modification of the form for the purpose of
modifying the meaning; including what we term

inf. n. as above, (TA,) meaning He employed the
thing in other [i. e. more] than one way; as
though he turned it from one way to another way.

or فِى أَمْرِى, speaking of a man, (S, O,) i. q.
قَلَّبْتُهُ [meaning I employed him to act in whatsoever way he pleased, according to his own judgment or discretion or free will, or I made him a
free agent, in the disposal, or management, of the
affair, or my affair: or (assumed tropical:)  I made him, or employed him, to practise versatility, or to use art
or artifice or cunning, in the affair, or in my
affair; for the quasi-pass., تصرّف, is said to be
from الصَّرْفُ as signifying الحِيلَةُ, and is expl. as
syn. with اِحْتَالَ: but the former meaning is the
more common: and it is also used as meaning
simply I employed him in the managing of the
affair, or my affair]. (K.) ―
-b7-  [Hence also, صرّف
الفَرَسَ He exercised the horse.]
-A2-  صرّف الشَّرَابَ:
and صرّف الخَمْرَ: see 1, latter half.
3
صَاْرَفَ see 1, third sentence. ―

signifies also (assumed tropical:)  The dealing, or buying and selling,

-b2-
And It (a thing) was, or became, employed in
other [i. e. more] than one way; as though it

―
-b3-  [Hence,] تصرّف فِى الأَمْرِ, (K,) or فِى أَمْرِى,
(S,) quasi-pass. of صَرَّفْتُهُ فِيهِ, (S, * O, K,) thus
syn. with تقلّب [meaning He acted in whatsoever
way he pleased, according to his own judgment or
discretion or free will, or as a free agent, in the
disposal, or management, of the affair, or my
affair; or he was, or became, employed to do so]:
(K:) or it is from الصَّرْفُ as signifying الحِيلَةُ;
(S, M, TA;) i. e. it means (tropical:)  [he practised versatility, or] he used art or artifice or cunning, in
the affair, or in my affair; syn. اِحْتَالَ. (TA
[and in like manner Bd in xxv. 20: but the
former meaning is the more common: see also
8].) [It is also used as meaning simply He employed himself, or was employed, in the managing
of the affair, or my affair; because the management of affairs generally requires the practice of
versatility, or the use of art or artifice or cunning.]

7
انصرف, (S, M, O, K,) inf. n. اِنْصِرَافٌ, (O,)

or became, turned, or sent, or put, away, or back,
therefrom; or averted, or repelled, therefrom:
(M:) [or shifted from one state, or condition, to
another: (see 1, first sentence:)] or i. q. اِنْكَفَّ;
so in the copies of the K; but [this is an inadequate explanation;] the right [or better] explanation is انْكَفَأَ [i. e. he, or it, reverted, or returned;
or was, or became, turned away or back]; agreeably with what is said in the O. (TA.) ثُمَّ انْصَرَفُوا
in the Kur [ix. 128] means Then they return, or
go back, from the place in which they have listened: or then they turn away from doing aught
of that which they have heard. (M.) ―

صَرِفَ; you say, صَرَفَ لِأَهْلِهِ [as though
meaning صَرَفَ نَفْسَهُ لِأَهْلِهِ] and اصطرف: (M:) or
he used art or artifice or cunning (تصرّف) in the
seeking of gain: (O, K, TA:) or [meaning thus]
you say, اصطرف فِى طَلَبِ الكَسْبِ. (S.)
-A2-  It is
also trans.: you say, اصطرف وَجْهَهُ: see 1, first
quarter. ―

صَرْفٌ [as an inf. n.: see 1]. ―
-b2-  Used as a subst.,
The evil accidents, mishaps, or calamities, of
time, or fortune; [thus expl. as having a pl. signification;] صَرْفُ الدَّهْرِ meaning حَدَثَانُهُ, (S, M,
O, K,) and نَوَائِبُهُ, (S, O, K,) or حَوَادِثُهُ; (Msb;)
because it [i. e. time, or fortune,] turns things
from their way, or course: (M:) [but it seems
to be more properly rendered the shifting of
fortune, or its shifting about; and to be an inf. n.
sometimes used as a simple subst., and therefore
having a pl., for] its pl. is صُرُوفٌ. (M, Msb.)
In the phrase قَدْ شَحَطَتْ صَرْفُ نَوَاهَا, in a verse
of Sakhr-el-Ghei, [ISd says,] he has made it
fem. because of its dependance upon النَّوَى [which
is fem.; as though the meaning were The afflictions that are the consequence of the course
taken by her in her journey have exceeded the
bounds of moderation]: (M:) [or it is here made
fem. because having the signification of a broken
pl., which is fem.:] or the meaning is, قَدْ بَعُدَتْ
تَصَرُّفُ وَجْهِهَا الَّذِى أَخَذَتْ فِيهِ [i. e. the shiftingabout of her course that she has taken has become
far-extending; صَرْف being thus used as an
inf. n.; for the Arabs sometimes make the inf. n.
fem., saying أَوْجَعَتْنِى ضَرْبُكَ as well as أَوْجَعَنِى
ضَرْبُكَ; (see EM p. 157;) and this I think the
most preferable explanation]. (Skr in his Expos.
of the Poems of the Hudhalees, p. 14 of the vol.
edited by Kosegarten.) ―
-b3-  Also Repentance. (S,
M, O, Msb, K.) [See a phrase below, in which

to put in practice art or artifice or cunning, nor
aid]: (S, TA:) or this means and they are not
able to avert, or repel, from themselves punishment, (O, K, TA,) nor to aid themselves. (O,
TA.) ―
-b5-  And Excellence, or superiority, of a
dirhem, (S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) and of a deenár,
(M,) over another, (S, M, &c.,) in goodness, (S,
Mgh, Msb,) or in value; (M, Mgh, O, K;) as
in the saying, بَيْنَ الدِّرْهَمَيْنِ صَرْفٌ [Between the
two dirhems is a difference of excellence], because
of the [superior] goodness of the silver of one of
them: (S:) and in like manner, of speech; (O,
K;) as in the saying فُلَانٌ لَا يَعْرِفُ صَرْفَ الكَلَامِ
Such a one knows not the excellence of speech over
other speech: (O:) and [in like manner] one says,
لِهٰذَا عَلَى هٰذَا صَرْفٌ There is, or pertains, to this,
an excess, and an excellence, over this; for when
one is judged to excel, it, or he, is turned aside
from its, or his, likes, or fellows. (O, K. *) ―
-b6-
And The night; and the day: (K:) [because of
their interchanging:] الصَّرْفَانِ signifies the night
and the day; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ الصِّرْفَانِ; (K;)
the latter accord. to Ibn-'Abbád; (O;) like
الصِّرْعَانِ, with kesr also [as well as with fet-h].
(TA.) ―
-b7-  In the saying (S, M, O, Msb) of the
Arabs, (M,) or of the Prophet, (O, Msb,) in a
certain trad., (K,) لَا يُقْبَلُ مِنْهُ صَرْفٌ وَلَا عَدْلٌ
[Neither صَرْف nor عَدْل shall be accepted from
him], (S, M, * O, Msb, *) by صَرْف is meant
repentance; (S, M, O, Msb, K;) and by عَدْل,
ransom: (M, Msb, K:) or by the former, art, or
artifice, or cunning; (Yoo, S, M, O, K;) and by
the latter, ransom: (M:) or by the former,
acquisition of gain; and by the latter, ransom:
(K:) or by the former, a supererogatory act;
(A'Obeyd, M, O, K;) and by the latter, an obligatory act: (A'Obeyd, M, K:) or vice versâ:
(K:) or by the former, weight; and by the latter,
measure: (M, O, K:) or by the former, deviation;
and by the latter, a right, or direct, course:
(IAar, M:) or by the former, مَا يُتَصَرَّفُ فِيهِ [app.
meaning an evasive artifice]; and by the latter,
a like: (Th, M:) or by the former, value, or
price; and by the latter, a like; the saying
originally relating to the bloodwit (الدِّيَة): one
says, لَمْ يَقْبَلُوا مِنْهُمْ صَرْفًا وَلَا عَدْلًا, i. e. They did
not accept from them a bloodwit, nor did they
slay one man for him, of their people, who had
been slain; but they required from them more
than that; for the Arabs used [often] to slay two
men, and three, for one man; when they slew a
man for a man, that was العَدْل with them; and
when they took a bloodwit, having turned from
the blood to another thing, that was صَرْف, i. e.
the value, or price, was صَرْف: then the saying
was applied in relation to anything, so as to be
proverbially used in the case of him who was to
render more than was incumbent on him: it has
also been said that by صَرْف is meant [in the
saying cited above] something additional, or in
excess; but this is nought. (M.)
صِرْفٌ: see its dual in the next preceding paragraph, near the middle.
-A2-  Also Pure, unmixed,
or free from admixture; (S, M, Mgh, O, Msb,
K;) applied to wine, (S, M, O, Msb, K,) or
beverage, as meaning unmixed, (S, M, O, Msb,)
and so ↓ مَصْرُوفٌ, (O, K,) and to other things,

sandals are dyed, (S, O,) or with which the hide
is dyed: (Msb:) or a certain red thing with
which the hide is tanned (يُدْبَغُ [perhaps a mistranscription for يُصْبَغُ]). (So in a copy of the M.)
الصَّرْفَةُ One of the Mansions of the Moon; [the
Twelfth Mansion;] a single very bright star,
[
β of Leo,] (S, O, K, and Kzw in his Descr.
of the Mansions of the Moon,) by which are some
small evanescent stars; (Kzw;) over against,
(بِتِلْقَآء, so in my copies of the S,) or following,
(O, K and Kzw ubi suprà,) الزُّبْرَة; (S, O, K,
Kzw;) [i. e.] it is a single star behind the خَرَاتَانِ
of the Lion; (M;) it is on the hinder part of the
tail (ذَنَب) of the Lion; [wherefore it is called
by our astronomers Deneb;] and is also called the
قُنْب, which means the sheath of the penis, of the
Lion: (Kzw in his Descr. of Leo: [in the S and
O, erroneously, “the قَلْب of the Lion: ”]) [it
rose aurorally, in Central Arabia, about the
commencement of the era of the Flight, on the
8th of Sept., O. S.; and set aurorally on the
9th of March:] Ibn-Kunáseh says, (M,) it is
called الصَّرْفَةُ because of the turning away of the
cold (S, M, O, K) from the heat, (M,) and the
coming of the heat, (S, O,) accord. to the [O and]
K at its rising, but [as] IB says, correctly because of the turning away of the heat [at its
rising], and the coming of the cold: (TA:) [i. e.,
correctly,] it is thus called because of the turning
away of the cold at its setting in the early mornings, and the turning away of the heat at its
rising from beneath the rays of the sun in the
early mornings: (Kzw in his Descr. of Leo:)
when it rises before the dawn, that is the beginning of autumn; and when it sets with the
rising of the dawn, that is the beginning of spring.
(M.) [Hence,] الصَّرْفَةُ is [called] نَابُ الدَّهْرِ الَّذِى
يُفْتَرُّ, (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K,) or نَابُ الدَّهْرِ الَّذِى يَفْتَرُّ
عَنْهُ [The dog-tooth of time, or fortune, which it
shows smiling]: for when الصرفة rises, [a mistake
for “ sets, aurorally,”] the blossoms come forth
and the herbage attains its full height: (M and
K in art. فر:) in the T it is said that الصَّرْفَة is
called by the Arabs نَابُ الدَّهْرِ [the dog-tooth of
time, or fortune,] لِأَنَّهُ يَفْتَرُّ عَنِ البَرْدِ وَعَنِ الحَرِّ فِى
الحَالَتَيْنِ [i. e. because it smiles revealing (the
advent of) the cold and (that of) the heat, in its
two states (of auroral rising and setting)]. (TA.)
-A2-  صَرْفَةٌ also signifies A certain kind of bead
(خَرَزَةٌ); (Lh, S, M, O, K;) mentioned among

are conciliated, so as to be turned thereby from
their ways of acting or conduct or the like. (Lh,
M.)
-A3-  And A bow having upon it a black mark or
spot (شَامَةٌ سَوْدَآءُ), the arrows of which, when they

milked the she-camel in the early morning, between dawn and sunrise, and then left her until
the like time of the morrow. (O, K. *)
الصَّرَفَانُ Death; (M, K;) a name of death.
(IAar, O.)

dates; (S, M, O, Msb;) a heavy sort of dates:
(K:) n. un. with ة: (M:) AHn says, (M, O,) on
the authority of certain of the Arabs, (O,) that
the صَرَفَانَة is a red date, like the بَرْنِيَّة, (M, O,
Msb,) but (M, O) hard to be chewed, (M, O, K,)
tough, (M, O,) and the heaviest of all dates: (M,
O, Msb:) persons having households and slaves
and hired men provide it, because of its satisfying
quality, (O, K, [but for لجرآتِهَا in the O, referring
to the n. un., and لِجَزَاتِهَا in copies of the K, and
لجِزايَتِها in the CK, I read لِجَزَائِهَا, which is evidently the right reading, and agrees with what
here follows,]) and its standing in great stead:
(O, K:) or it is the [sort of dates called] صَيْحَانِىّ
[q. v.]: (K:) AHn says, En-Nowshajánee told
me that the صَرَفَانَة is [called] الصَّيْحَانِيَّةُ in El-
Hijáz, and in like manner its palm-tree. (O.)
صَرَفَانَةٌ رِبْعِيَّهْ تُصْرَمُ بِالصَّيْفِ وَتُؤْكَلُ بِالشَّتِيَّهْ is one
of their proverbs [expl. in art. ربع]. (AHn,
O, K.)

O, K;) a rel. n.: (O, K:) or it is correctly with

that it is with د; and this is the right. (M.)
صَرُوفٌ A she-camel that makes a grating, or
creaking, sound with her tushes, or canine teeth.

↓ صَرِيفَةٌ signifies a dry سَعَفَة. (K.) And AHn
says, (M, O,) in one place, (M,) الصَّرِيفُ signifies,
(M, O, K,) as some assert, (O,) What has become dry, of trees; (M, O, K;) like الضَّرِيعُ;
(M;) called in Pers. حُذْخُوش, (so in copies of
the K, in the CK خُدْخُوش, and in the O
الخَذْخُوَش, [all app. mistranscriptions, for I find
nothing like them in Pers. except partially, i. e.
خُوش meaning “ dry,” like خُشْك,]) and also
called [in Arabic] القَفْلَةُ [the tree that has become
dry]. (O.) [See also صَرِيعٌ, with the unpointed
ص.]

صَارِفٌ [act. part. n. of 1: as such having, among
other meanings, the meaning of Grating, or
creaking; or making a grating, or creaking,
sound: and so ↓ صَرَّافٌ, but properly in an intensive sense; for] the dual of صَرَّافٌ is used by the
poet Aboo-Khirásh as meaning two thongs of a
sandal that make a creaking sound: (M:) [and
↓ صِرِّيفٌ likewise means making a creaking sound
with the teeth: so accord. to Freytag, from Jereer.] One says, مَا فِى فَمِهِ صَارِفَةٌ, meaning
He has not in his mouth a canine tooth [lit. a
grater or creaker; for سِنٌّ صَارِفَةٌ a tooth that
makes a grating, or creaking, sound]. (M.)

صَارِفَةٌ: pl. صَوَارِفُ: see تَصَارِيفُ, below.
صَيْرَفٌ One who practices art or artifice or
cunning, in the disposal, or management, of
affairs; (S, M, O, K;) as also ↓ صَيْرَفِىٌّ; (S, O,
K;) which latter is applied by the poet Suweyd
Ibn-Abee-Káhil El-Yeshkuree [in the like sense]
as an epithet to a tongue, in his saying,
وَلِسَانًا صَيْرَفِيًّا صَارِمًا
كَحُسَامِ السَّيْفِ مَا مَسَّ قَطَعْ
[And a cunning, sharp tongue, like the edge of the
sword, what it touches it cuts]. (S, O.) ―

also what next follows.
صَيْرَفِىٌّ i. q. ↓ صَرَّافٌ, (S, M, O, Msb,) or صَرَّافُ
دَرَاهِمَ, (K,) and so ↓ صَيْرَفٌ, (M, Msb, K,) i. e.
A money-changer; (M, Msb, TA;) except that
صَرَّافٌ has an intensive signification [app. as
meaning a skilful money-changer, and hence it is
often used in the present day as meaning a banker]:
(Msb:) all are applied to him who knows and
distinguishes the relative excellence, or superiority,
of pieces of money: (Mgh:) these appellations
are from المُصَارَفَةُ, (S, O,) or from التَّصَرُّفُ, (M,)
or from صَرْفٌ meaning “ excellence,” or “ superiority,” of one dirhem [or deenár] over another,
(Mgh, and Msb on the authority of IF in relation
to the first,) because such as excels, or is superior,
is turned aside from the deficient: (Mgh:) the
pl. is صَيَارِفَةٌ (S, M, O, K) and صَيَارِفُ (M) and
صَيَارِيفُ, this last occurring in poetry, (S, M, O,
K,) by poetic license, for the sake of the measure.

يَجِدُوا عَنْهَا مَصْرِفًا, (TA,) meaning [And they shall
not find] a place to which to turn away, or back,
from it: (Bd, Jel:) or, a turning away, or back,
from it: (Bd:) pl. مَصَارِفُ. (TA.)

[q. v.]; and so in the Fáïk.)

and طَرْفٌ غَيْرُ مُتَصَرِّفٍ signify the same, respectively, as ظَرْفٌ مُتَمَكِّنٌ and ظَرْفٌ غَيْرُ مُتَمَكِّنٍ: see

sorts of nouns, (O, K,) meaning, respectively,
[like ↓ مَصْرُوفٌ and غَيْرُ مَصْرُوفٍ,] Inflected, or
declined, with tenween, and not so inflected or
declined. (O, TA.)
