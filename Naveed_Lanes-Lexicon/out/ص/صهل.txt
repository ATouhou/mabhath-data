صهل1
صَهَلَ, said of a horse, aor.
صَهِلَ (S, O, Msb, K)
and
صَهَلَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. صَهِيلٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,)
[and تَصْهَالٌ is an intensive inf. n., (see صَهِيلٌ
below,)] He neighed; lit. uttered his voice; or
voiced. (S, O, K.)
6
تَصَاهَلَتِ الخَيْلُ The horses neighed, one to
another. See an ex. in a verse cited voce رُودٌ,
where تَصَاهَلْ occurs for تَتَصَاهَلْ.]
صَهْلٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.
صَهَلٌ A voice with hoarseness, roughness, harshness, or gruffness; [this is app. correct, or nearly
so; but what follows I think evidently wrong;
and probably taken from a copy of the O, in this
instance incorrect;] like ↓ صَهْلٌ: and صَهْلٌ is syn.
with صَحْلٌ: (K accord. to the CK and TA: [to
which is added in the TA, i. e. hoarseness, roughness, harshness, or gruffness, in the voice:]) or syn.
with صَحَلٌ: (so in my MS. copy of the K:)
[the explanation given by Sgh appears to be correctly as follows:] one says, فِى صَوْتِهِ صَهَلٌ and
صَحَلٌ, i. e. [In his voice is] sharpness and hardness: it is said in a trad. of Umm-Maabad, فِى
صَوْتِهِ صَهَلٌ or صَحَلٌ, accord. to different relations:
and A'Obeyd says that الصَّهَلُ is like البَحَحُ [i. e.
hoarseness, &c.], not intense, but pleasing. (Thus
I find in the O.) [It is said in Har p. 646
that الصحل and ↓ الصهل signify المَآء القليل: but
I think that this has been taken from some commentator who had found الصحل and الصهل erroneously written for الضَّحْلُ and الضَّهْلُ, with ض.]
صَهَالٌ: see the next paragraph.
صَهِيلٌ [an inf. n., see 1,] and ↓ صُهَالٌ (S, O, K)
and ↓ صَاهِلَةٌ, of which the pl. is صَوَاهِلُ, (O, K,)
and ↓ تَصْهَالٌ, [which last is an intensive inf. n.,]
(O,) The neighing or neigh, lit. the voicing or
voice, of the horse: (S, O, K:) similar to نَهِيقٌ
and نُهَاقٌ (S, TA) in relation to the ass. (TA.)
أَهْلُ صَهِيلٍ وَأَطِيطٍ means Possessors of horses and
of camels: (TA in art. اط:) it is said in a trad.
of Umm-Zara, فَجَعَلَنِى فِى أَهْلِ صَهِيلٍ وَأَطِيطٍ
[And he set me among possessors of horses and of
camels]: (O, TA:) she meant that she was among
people of little property, and he transferred her to
people of much wealth; for the possessors of
horses and of camels are more [rich] than the
possessors of sheep or goats. (TA in the present
art.)
صَهَّالٌ Neighing, lit. uttering his voice; [or
rather that neighs much or often;] an epithet
applied to a horse; (JK, * S, Msb, * K;) and so
↓ صَاهِلٌ and ↓ ذُو صَاهِلٍ. (JK. [But these two
I find not elsewhere in this sense.]) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
بَنَاتُ صَهَّالٍ Horses. (TA in art. بنى. [It should
be observed that بَنَات applied to irrational beings
is pl. of اِبْنٌ as well as of اِبْنَةٌ.])
صَاهِلٌ and ذُو صَاهِلٍ: see صَهَّالٌ. ―
-b2-  صَاهِلٌ applied to a he-camel signifies That strikes, or beats,
(O, K,) with his fore leg and his hind leg, (K,) and
bites, and does not ever utter a grumbling cry, in
consequence of his disdainfulness, (O, K,) but whose
inside makes a confused and continued, or rumbling,
sound, (K, TA,) by reason of his disdainfulness:
(TA:) so expl. by Lth: one says جَمَلٌ صَاهِلٌ and
ذُو صَاهِلٍ: (O, TA:) and نَاقَةٌ ذَاتُ صَاهِلٍ (O, K)
and بِهَا صَاهِلٌ: (O, TA:) or ذُو صَاهِلٍ signifies a
stallion camel excited by lust, assaulting [the
she-camels], and causing a sound to be heard from
his inside; as also ذُو شَاهِقٍ. (TA in art. شهق.)
And ذُو صَاهِلٍ applied to a man, (assumed tropical:)  Vehement in
springing or rushing, or in assaulting or attacking, and in excitement or provocation: (M, K,
TA:) or a man whose anger is vehement; as also
ذُو شَاهِقٍ. (TA in art. شهق.)
[
صَيْهَلٌ is expl. by Reiske as signifying Firma
ac tenax durities: so says Freytag: but I find
not any authority for this.]
صَاهِلَةٌ: see صَهِيلٌ: and see also ثُغَآءٌ, in art.
ثغو. ―
-b2-  Its pl., صَوَاهِلُ, is also applied (by the poet
Aboo-Zubeyd Et-Tá-ee, O, TA) to The sounds of
مَسَاحٍ [i. e. iron shovels or spades]. (O, K.) Also
(by the poet Temeem Ibn-Abee-Mukbil, O, TA)
to The sounds of flies among herbage; (O, K;)
app. meaning the humming or buzzing, [sounds]
of their flying. (O, TA.)
