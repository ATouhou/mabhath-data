صوخ4
اصاخ لَهُ (S, A, K, TA) and إِلَيْهِ, (A, TA,)
inf. n. إِصَاخَةٌ, (TA,) He listened to him, or it.
(S, K, TA.) [See a verse of Aboo-Du-ád (cited
here as an ex. in the S and TA) voce نَاشِدٌ.]
―
-b2-  And اصاخ signifies also (tropical:)  He was silent, or
spake not, or ceased from speaking: so in the
saying, أَصَاخَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى حَقِّ فُلَانٍ, meaning
(tropical:)  Such a one was silent respecting the right, or
due, of such a one, that he might take it away.
(A, TA.) [And it is said that] it signifies thus in
the prov., أَصَاخَ إِصَاخَةَ المِنْدَهِ لِلنَّاشِدِ, i. e. He was
silent with the silence of the frequent chider of
camels [or of him who drives and chides many
camels] to one making known, or giving information of, a thing lost: applied to him who strives,
or labours, in seeking [a thing] and then lacks
ability, and desists. (Meyd. [But the verse cited
voce نَاشِدٌ suggests another rendering, which I
think preferable. In Freytag's “ Arab. Prov. ”
i. 718, للناشد is omitted.])
