صلى1
صَلَاهُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) aor. يَصْلِيهِ, (S,
Msb, K,) inf. n. صَلْىٌ, (S, M, K,) He roasted,
broiled, or fried, it, namely, flesh-meat, (S, M,
Msb, K,) &c.; (S;) and صَلَاهُ فِى النَّارِ and عَلَى
النَّارِ signify the same; and also he burned it. (TA.)
And (so in the M, but in the K “ or ”) صَلَاهُ (M, K)
فِى النَّارِ (M) He threw it into the fire to be burned;
as also ↓ اصلاهُ; and ↓ صلّاهُ, (M, K,) inf. n. تَصْلِيَةٌ;
(TA;) namely, flesh-meat. (M, K. [But see the
next sentence.]) And صَلَاهُ النَّارَ and فِى النَّارِ and
عَلَى النَّارِ, (M, K,) inf. n. صَلْىٌ and صُلِىٌّ and
صِلِىٌّ; (M;) and النَّارَ ↓ اصلاهُ, and النَّارَ ↓ صلّاهُ;
He made him to enter into the fire, and to remain,
stay, dwell, or abide, therein: (M, K:) and
فُلَانٌ النَّارَ ↓ صُلِّىَ [Such as one was made to enter
into the fire, &c.]: (M:) [or] you say, صَلَيْتُ
الرَّجُلَ نَارًا, meaning I made the man to enter fire
and to be burned: and ↓ أَصْلَيْتُهُ, with ا, when you
mean I threw him, or cast him, into the fire, as
though intending burning [him]; as also ↓ صَلَّيْتُهُ,
inf. n. تَصْلِيَةٌ. (S.) ―
-b2-  And صَلَيْتُ فُلَانًا, (T, TA,)
or لِفُلَانٍ, (S, TA,) (tropical:)  I laboured in a case, or an
affair, desiring to calumniate, or slander, such a
one therein, and to cause him to fall into destruction: (T, S, TA:) or صَلَيْتُهُ and صَلَيْتُ لَهُ both
signify I calumniated, or slandered, him, and
caused him to fall into destruction, (M, TA,) in consequence thereof: (M:) or, accord. to the K, صَلَى
فُلَانًا, of which the inf. n. is صَلْىٌ, signifies he
soothed, coaxed, wheedled, or cajoled, such a one:
or deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or
outwitted, him: which meanings are not in any
of the three lexicons above mentioned: accord. to
the A, صَلَيْتُ بِفُلَانٍ [probably a mistranscription
for لِفُلَانٍ] means (tropical:)  I framed a stratagem, or plot,
to cause such a one to fall; there said to be tropical. (TA.) ―
-b3-  صَلَى يَدَهُ بِالنَّارِ [said in the TA
to be a mistake]: see 2.
-A2-  صَلِىَ النَّارَ, (S, M, Msb,
K,) and بِالنَّارِ, (M, Msb, K,) aor. يَصْلَى, (S, Msb, *
K, *) inf. n. صَلًى, (Msb,) or صُلِىٌّ, (S, K, [صَلْيًا
in the CK being a mistranscription for صُلِيًّا,])
or both, (M,) and صِلِىٌّ and صِلَآءٌ, (M, K,) and
accord. to the K صَلَآءٌ, but this is a mistake for
صَلًى, (TA,) He was, or became, burned [by the
fire]: (S:) or he endured, or suffered, the heat of
the fire; as also النَّارَ ↓ تصلّى: (M, K:) or he felt
the heat of the fire: (Msb:) and one says ↓ تصلّى
حَرَّ النَّارِ and ↓ اصطلاهُ [in this last sense or in the
sense next preceding]: (Ham p. 792:) and صَلِىَ
النَّارَ he entered into the fire: (TA in art. بله: see
an ex. voce بَلْهَ:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib, صَلِىَ
بِالنَّارِ means he was tried (بُلِىَ) by fire, or by the
fire; and so بِكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  [by such a thing, as though
by fire]. (TA.) [In the Kur, in which are many
exs. of it, (iv. 11, xiv. 34, xvii. 19, &c.,) it is always
trans. by itself, without بِ.] And صَلِىَ بِالأَمْرِ, (S,
M, *) and بِالحَرْبِ; (S;) and الأَمْرَ ↓ تصلّى, and
الحَرْبَ; (M;) He endured, or suffered, the heat,
and severity, or vehemence, of the affair, or case,
and of the war, or fight: (S, M:) Aboo-Zubeyd
says,
حَرَّ حَرْبِهِمُ ↓ فَقَدْ تَصَلَّيْتُ
المَقْرُورُ مِنْ قَرَسِ ↓ كَمَا تَصَلَّى
[And I have suffered the heat and vehemence of
their war, like as he who is affected with cold
suffers in consequence of coldest and most abundant hoar-frost]. (M.)
-A3-  [It is said that] صَلِىَ
الرَّجُلُ signifies also لَزِمَ [i. e. The man kept to, or
clave to, a thing]; and so ↓ اصطلى: whence Zj
holds صَلَاةٌ [expl. in art. صلو] to be derived;
because it is a keeping, or cleaving, to that which
God has appointed: and hence also, [it is said,]
فِى النَّارِ ↓ مَنْ يُصَلَّى, i. e. يلزم [app. يُلْزَمُ, meaning
مَنْ يُلْزَمُ النَّارَ He who is made to keep, or cleave,
to the fire; nearly agreeing with صَلَّاهُ النَّارَ as
expl. above from the M and K]. (TA.)
-A4-  And
صَلَيْتُ الظَّهْرَ means I struck, or beat, that part
of the back which is called صَلًا: or I hit that
part: but this is extr.; for by rule it should be
صَلَوْتُهُ, like as Hudheyl say. (M. [See 1 in art.
صلو.])

صَلَّىَ see 1, second sentence; and third sentence
in three places; and last sentence but one. ―
-b2-
One says also, صلّى يَدَهُ بِالنَّارِ, (M, TA,) accord.
to the K ↓ صَلَى, [without teshdeed,] but this is
wrong, as is shown by a verse cited in the M,
(TA,) He warmed his hand with the fire. (M,
K, TA.) [And it is said in the TA that صلا
ظَهْرَهُ بالنهر means أَدْفَأَهُ: but I think that the right
reading is صلّى ظَهْرَهُ بِالنَّمِرَةِ, i. e. He warmed his
back with the woollen garment called نَمِرَة.] ―
-b3-
And صَلَّيْتُ العَصَا بِالنَّارِ I made the staff supple,
and straightened it, by means of fire: (S:) or
صلّى العَصَا عَلَى النَّارِ, (M, K,) inf. n. تَصْلِيَةٌ;
(K;) and ↓ تصلّاها; he parched and darkened the
staff upon the fire; syn. لَوَّحَهَا: (M, K:) or صلّى
العَصَا he straightened the staff by turning it round
over the fire: (T in art. دوم: see an ex. in a verse
cited in that art., conj. 10:) and صَلَّيْتُ القَنَاةَ I
straightened the spear-shaft by means of fire:
(A, TA:) and صَلَّيْتُ العُودَ بِالنَّارِ I rendered supple
the stick, or branch, by means of fire. (Msb.)

اصطلى He warmed himself (M, K) بِالنَّارِ
[by means of the fire]: (M:) one says, اِصْطَلَيْتُ
بِالنَّارِ and بِهَا ↓ تَصَلَّيْتُ [app. meaning I warmed
myself by means of the fire]: (S:) or اصطلى النَّارَ
and بِالنَّارِ mean he became warm by means of the
fire: and بِالنَّارِ ↓ تصلّى, he became burnt by the
fire. (MA.) Hence, in the Kur [xxvii. 7 and
xxviii. 29], لَعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ [May-be ye will warm
yourselves]: (TA:) in relation to which it is said
that the time was winter, and therefore الاِصْطِلَآء
was needed. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-  It is also said of the
chameleon, as meaning He repaired to the sun.
(M and L in art. شقذ: see an ex. in a verse cited
voce شَقَذَانٌ.) ―
-b3-  And one says of a courageous
man, with whom one cannot cope, لَا يُصْطَلَى بِنَارِهِ
[lit. One cannot warm himself by means of his
fire; meaning (assumed tropical:)  one cannot approach him when
he is inflamed with rage, especially in fight, or
battle]. (S.) The phrase may be also used
satirically, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  One will not seek his
hospitality. (Meyd. [See Freytag's Arab. Prov.
ii. 588.]) ―
-b4-  See also 1, latter half, in two places.
صَلًى: see صَلَآءٌ.
صَلَآءٌ: see صَلَايَةٌ.
صِلَآءٌ Roasted, broiled, or fried, flesh-meat.
(S, M, K.) ―
-b2-  And, as also ↓ صَلًى, (S, M, K,)
the former with kesr and the latter with fet-h,
(S,) Fuel; (S, * M, K;) syn. وَقُودٌ; (M, K, TA;
[in the CK, erroneously, وُقُود;]) i. e. مَا تُوقَدُ
بِهِ النَّارُ; (TA;) you say صِلَآءُ النَّارِ and صَلَى النَّارِ:
(S:) or both signify fire: (M, Mgh, K:) or صِلَآءٌ
signifies the heat of fire. (Msb.) One says, هُوَ
أَحْسَنُ مِنَ الصِّلَآءِ فِى الشِّتَآءِ [It, or he, is better
than fire in winter]. (TA.)
صَلِىٌّ: see مَصْلِىٌّ.
صَلَآءَةٌ: see what next follows.
صَلَايَةٌ and ↓ صَلَآءَةٌ, (S, M, Mgh, K,) the latter
with ء because ↓ صَلَآءٌ is used as the pl., [or rather
coll. gen. n.,] but not by those who say صَلَايَةٌ,
(Sb, M,) [for] the pl. [of this] is صُلِىٌّ and صِلِىٌّ
(K) and صَلَايَاتٌ, (MA,) i. q. فِهْرٌ [i. e. A stone
such as fills the hand; or of the size of that with
which one bruises and breaks walnuts and the
like]: (S:) or a thing with which perfume is
bruised, brayed, or pounded: (M, K:) or a stone
upon which one bruises, or powders, (MA, Mgh,)
perfume or some other thing; (Mgh;) that with
which [not upon which] one does so being called
مِدْوَكٌ. (MA.) Imra-el-Keys [in a verse of his
Mo'allakah, (see EM p. 45,) as some relate it,]
uses the phrase صَلَايَةُ حَنْظَلِ, because colocynths,
when they have become dry, are split therewith.
(S. [But there are two other readings, صَرَايَة and
صَرَابَة.]) ―
-b2-  Also, (K,) as being likened thereto,
(TA,) (assumed tropical:)  The forehead. (K.) ―
-b3-  And the former
word, A rough, rugged, سَرِيحَة [or long strip] of
[high ground such as is termed] قُفّ. (ISh, Az,
TA.)
صِلِّيَانٌ: see art. صل.
[
صَالٍ is expl. by Freytag as meaning Heated
or warmed (“ calefactus ”), and burnt: and the
pl. is said by him to be صُلِىٌّ: but he names no
authority: if this be correct, it must be a possessive epithet from صَلِىَ.]
صَالِيَةٌ A support for the cooking-pot, such as is
termed أُثْفِيَّةٌ. (MA.)
مَصْلِىٌّ Roasted, broiled, or fried; as also
↓ صَلِىٌّ. (Ham pp. 13-14. [Both of these words
are there without any syll. signs.]) It is said in
a trad., أُتِىَ بِشَاةٍ مَصْلِيَّةٍ i. e. A roasted sheep, or
goat, was brought. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  And صَيْحَانِيَّةٌ
مَصْلِيَّةٌ means [A date of the sort called صَيْحَانِىّ]
dried in the sun. (A, TA.)
أَرْضٌ مَصْلَاةٌ A land abounding with the plant
called صِلِّيَان. (K.)
مِصْلَاةٌ A snare that is set up for birds &c.:
(S, M: *) pl. مَصَالٍ. (S, M.) It is said in a trad.,
إِنَّ لِلشَّيْطَانِ فُخُوخًا وَمَصَالِىَ (S) or مَصَالِىَ وَفُخُوخًا
i. e. [Verily to the Devil belong snares and traps]
with which he catches men. (M.)
مُصْطَلًى The limbs of a man, or his arms and
legs and face and every prominent part, which
become cold at the time of death, and which are
warmed at the fire: (AHeyth, L in art. برد:) or
the face and extremities. (Z, TA.) One says,
بَرَدَ المَوْتُ عَلَى مُصْطَلَاهُ. (AHeyth, L in art. برد:
see 1 in that art.)
