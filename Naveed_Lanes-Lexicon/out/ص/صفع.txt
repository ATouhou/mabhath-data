صَفَعَهُ, aor.
صَفَعَ, (O, Msb, K,) inf. n. صَفْعٌ, (S, *
O, Msb, TA,) accord. to Lth, (O, TA,) He
struck him with his fist, not vehemently, on the
back of his neck: (O, K, TA:) or, (O, K,)
accord. to Az (O, Msb, TA) and others, (Msb,)
he struck him [i. e. slapped him] with his
expanded hand (O, Msb, K, TA) on the back of
his neck, or on his body; not with the fist: (O,
Msb, TA:) or it is post-classical: (S, K:) [but
Fei says,] the assertion that it is post-classical is not
to be regarded: (Msb:) Az adds, IDrd says that
it is from ↓ صَوْفَعَةٌ, (O, TA,) which signifies the
top, or uppermost part, of the [cap called] كُمَّة,
and of the turban: (O, K, TA:) or this is a mistranscription, and is correctly with ق: (K, TA:)
[Sgh says,] this which Az mentions, [as] on the
authority of IDrd, I have not found in the Jm;
and it is correctly with ق. (O.)
صَفْعَةٌ A single act of striking [or slapping]
with the expanded hand upon the back of the neck,
or upon the body. (Msb.)
صَفْعَانُ or صَفْعَانٌ (accord. to different copies of
the S and K) A man who is struck [or slapped]
in the manner expl. above in the first paragraph;
