pauc.] أَصْلُبٌ and أَصْلَابٌ, (M, K,) each of which
two is used in poetry in a sing. sense, as though
every part of the صُلْب were regarded as a صُلْب
in itself, and صِلْبَةٌ, (M, TA,) of which last ISd
says, [but this I do not find in the M,] I do not
think it to be of established authority, unless it be
a contraction of صِلَبَةٌ. (TA.) Lh mentions, as a
phrase of the Arabs, هٰؤُلَآءِ أَبْنَآءُ صِلَبَتِهِمْ [These are
the sons of their loins: because the sperma of the
man is held to proceed from the صُلْب of the man,
as is said in the Ksh &c. in lxxxvi. 7]. (M. [See

فَوْقَ مَا أَحْكِى بِصُلْبٍ وَإِزَارْ
(assumed tropical:)  [Because God hath made you to have excellence
above what I can relate, in rank or quality, or in
power, and abstinence from unlawful things]: (S,
M, TA:) AA says that صُلْب here signifies حَسَب;
(S;) and إِزَار here signifies عَفَاف: (S, M, TA:)
but some expl. صُلْب here by both حَسَب and قُوَّة:
and some relate the latter hemistich otherwise, i. e.
فَوْقَ مَنْ أَحْكَأَ صُلْبًا بِإِزَارْ
meaning above such as binds the back with an
izár. (M, TA.) And it is said in a trad., إِنَّ

signifies also ichor, or watery humour, mixed
with blood, that flows from the dead: (M:) pl.
[of the former accord. to analogy, and perhaps
of the latter also,] صُلُبٌ. (K.) Hence, in a
trad., the phrase أَصْحَابُ الصُّلُبِ [in the CK

-b4-  And i. q.
عَلَمٌ [as meaning A banner, or standard; properly, in the form of a cross]: (O, K:) En-Nábighah Edh-Dhubyánee is said to have thus
called the عَلَم because there was upon it a صَلِيب
[i. e. a cross]; for he was a Christian. (O.) ―
