of origin, and of honour, or reputation. (Har
p. 135.) And دِرْهَمٌ صَحِيحٌ means A dirhem free

[which I find as syn. with صَحِيحٌ in my copy of

يُورِدَنَّ ذُو عَاهَةٍ عَلَى مُصِحٍّ (S, L) i. e. One whose
camels are affected by a murrain, or distemper,
shall by no means bring them to water immediately
after one whose camels are in a healthy, or sound,
state, so as to water the former beasts with the
latter: a prohibition apparently given for fear
that the latter beasts should become diseased like
the former, and it should be supposed that the
disease had passed by contagion, which ought not
to be imagined. (L. [See also مُمْرِضٌ.])
مَصَحَّةٌ A cause of one's being rendered healthy,
or sound in body. (L, K.) So in the saying,
الصَّوْمُ مَصَحَّةٌ [Fasting is a cause of one's being
rendered healthy]. (L, K.) One says also,
السَّفَرُ مَصَحَّةٌ [Travel is a cause of one's becoming

Counselling, or admonishing, or one who counsels
or admonishes, faithfully, or sincerely: so in a
verse of Meleeh El-Hudhalee; as though used by
poetic license for مُصَحِّحٌ. (L.)

who does, or says, vain, or false, things. (A, K.)
