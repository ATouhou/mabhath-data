تَصْوِى, (S, K,) inf. n. صُوِىٌّ; (Lth, Az, S, M, K;)
and صَوِيَت, (Az, M, K,) which is the form
preferred by Az, [aor. تَصْوَى,] inf. n. صَوًى;
(TA;) The palm-tree needed irrigation, and
became slender: (Az, TA:) or became dry, or
dried up; (S, M, K;) as also ↓ أَصْوَت, and
↓ صَوَّت: (K:) and in like manner one says of
other trees: and sometimes, of animals. (M.)

صوّى, (M,) inf. n. تَصْوِيَةٌ, (K,) primarily,
(M,) is used in relation to females, meaning He
abstained from milking her, in order that she
might become fat, (M, K,) and not be weak.
(M.) You say, صَوَّيْتُ النَّاقَةَ I abstained from
milking the she-camel for some days in order that
the milk might collect in her udder so that she might
become fat: or I made her milk to dry up, that
she might become fatter. (M.) And صَوَّيْتُ الشَّاةَ,
inf. n. as above, I made the udder of the ewe, or
goat, to become dry, that she might become
fatter: (S:) or صوّيت الغَنَمَ I made the milk of
the ewes, or goats, to dry up, purposely, that they
might become fatter; like as one says in relation
to camels: the subst. from the verb thus used is
↓ صَوًى; and this is said to mean The leaving an
animal and not milking her. (M.) Some say
that تَصْوِيَةٌ is like تَصْرِيَةٌ; and hence the trad.,
التَّصْوِيَةُ خِلَابَةٌ [i. e. The causing the milk to
collect in the udder of an animal by abstaining
from milking her for some days, when one desires
to sell her, is an endeavouring to deceive: but I
think that the right reading in this instance is
probably التَّصْرِيَةُ, with ر]. (TA.) ―

used in relation to a stallion (S, M, K) of the

(M.) One says, صَوَّيْتُ الفَحْلَ, (M,) inf. n. as
above, (S, K,) I put no burden upon the stallion
[camel], and did not bind him with a rope, in
order that he might become more brisk in covering, and more strong; (S, * M, K; *) thus expl.
by El-'Adebbes El-Kinánee: (S:) or I exempted
him from work, and fed him, until his spirit
returned to him, and he became fat. (M.) And
صَوَّيْتُ لِإِبِلِى فَحْلًا I chose for my camels a
stallion, and fed and nourished him for the office
of the stallion. (S.)
