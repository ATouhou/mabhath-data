صنم2
صنّم, inf. n. تَصْنِيمٌ, i. q. صَوَّرَ [He formed,
fashioned, figured, shaped, sculptured, or pictured: app. from the noun here following]. (K.)
صَنَمٌ [An idol: or an idol of a particular kind:]
a وَثَن: (S:) or a وَثَن that is worshipped: (K:)
or a وَثَن that is made of stones, and of wood; as
is said on the authority of I'Ab: (Msb:) or a
thing well known, that is carved of wood, and
that is made of molten and cast silver and copper
or brass: (M; and the like is said in the Msb on
the authority of IF:) or the صنم is made of
metals that melt; and the وثن is made of stone or
of wood: (Msb:) or, accord. to Hishám ElKelbee, the former is made of wood or of gold or
of silver or of other metal; and the latter, of
stones: or, accord. to Ibn-'Arafeh and El-Fihree,
the former is an image; and the latter is a shapeless thing: or, as some say, the former is a thing
having corporeal from, carved of wood or of stone
or of silver, and worshipped; and [the latter (in
the TA the صنم, but this I suppose to be a mistake
for the وثن,)] is a incorporeal form: or the former is a thing having the form of a human being;
and the latter, a thing having some other form:
or the former is a thing having material substance
or shape; and the latter, a thing not having
material substance or shape: or the former is of
stones or other material; and the latter, an
embodied form: (TA:) or, accord. to IAth, the
latter [?] is anything having corporeal form, made
of metal or of wood and stones, like the form of a
human being, made, and set up, and worshipped;
and the former [?] an incorporeal form: (TA in
art. وثن: [from explanations given above, it
seems that the reverse of this is the case:]) and
Abu-l-'Abbás states, on the authority of IAar,
that ↓ صَنَمَةٌ and نَصَمَةٌ signify an image (صُورَةٌ)
that is worshipped; (TA in the present art.;)
each of these two words is thus (بِالتَّحْرِيك), though
it would seem that accord. to the K the latter is
نَصْمَةٌ: (TA in art. نصم:) صَنَمٌ (S, K) it is said
(S) is an arabicized word, from شَمَن (S, K)
[which is Pers., though SM says,] I know not in
what language, for in Pers. it is بت [i. e. بُتْ]:
(TA:) the pl. is أَصْنَامٌ; (S, M, Msb;) which, as
used in the Kur xiv. 38, is said by Er-Rághib to
mean things that divert one from God. (TA.)
صَنَمَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
-A2-
Also A calamity; a dial. var. of صَلَمَةٌ; (K, TA;)
which is mentioned by Az, but omitted in the K
in art. صلم. (TA.)
-A3-  And The قَصَبَة [or quill]
of any feather. (K.)
