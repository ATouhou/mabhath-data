صبو1
صَبَا, (S, M, K,) aor. يَصْبُو, inf. n. صَبْوَةٌ, (S,)
or صَبْوٌ, (M, K,) and صُبُوٌّ (S, M, K) and صِبًا [also
written صِبًى, in the CK (erroneously) صَبًى,] and
صَبَآءٌ, (M, K,) [app., in its primary acceptation,
He was a youth, or boy, or child; agreeably with
an explanation of a phrase in what follows, and
with explanations of صِبًا and صَبَآءٌ which will be
found below: ―
-b2-  and hence,] He was, or became,
youthfully ignorant, or foolish, or silly: (M, K:)
[and, as seems to be indicated in the TA, he indulged in amorous dalliance; a sense in which
the verb, more especially with صِبًا (q. v. infrà)
for its inf. n., is very frequently used:] or he inclined to ignorant, or foolish, or silly, and youthful,
conduct; and in like manner ↓ تصابى; from
الصِّبَا, which is from الشَّوْق [i. e. “ desire ”]: (S:
[see an ex. of the inf. n. of the latter verb in a
verse cited voce شَابَ, in art. شيب:]) or صِبًا and
صَبَآءٌ, as inf. ns., signify the inclining the heart to
any one; and have other significations expl. in
what follows: and ↓ تَصَابٍ signifies the manifesting passionate love, and desire: (KL:) [but صِبًا
and صَبَآءٌ are often used in different senses: thus
Et-Tebreezee says that] in the following hemistich
of a poem by Dureyd Ibn-Es-Simmeh,
صَبَا مَا صَبَا حَتَّى عَلَا الشَّيْبُ رَأْسَهُ
the first صبا may be from الصِّبَى [or الصِّبَا], and
the second صبا from الصَّبَآءُ signifying الفَتَآءُ; so
that the meaning may be, He engaged in play, or
sport, and الصِّبَى [or amorous dalliance, &c.],
as long as he was a youth, [until hoariness came
upon his head;] or the meaning may be, he
engaged in الصِّبِى as long as he engaged therein,
&c. (Ham p. 380.) And صَبِىَ, (S, M, K,) [aor.
يَصْبَى,] inf. n. صَبَآءٌ, (S,) or صِبًا, (M,) [or both, as
will appear from what follows,] signifies He
played, or sported, with the صِبْيَان [i. e. youths,
or boys, or children]: (S:) or he acted in the
manner of the صِبْيَان: (M, K: *) or both صِبًا and
صَبَآءٌ, as inf. ns., signify the acting as a youth, or
boy, or child; and the playing, or sporting, with
youths, or boys, or children: (KL:) and ↓ تصبّى
and ↓ تصابى, said of an old man, signify he acted
in a youthful, boyish, or childish, manner. (TA.)

صَبًا [is of the fem. gender, and] is a subst. and
an epithet, [so that one says رِيحٌ صَبًا, as well as
صَبًا alone and رِيحُ الصَّبَا,] (M, TA,) [and signifies The east wind: or an easterly wind:] the
wind that blows from the place of sunrise:
(Msb:) or the wind of which the mean place
whence it blows is the place where the sun rises
when the night and day are equal; the opposite
wind of which is the دَبُور: (S:) or the wind that
faces the House [of God, i. e. the Kaabeh; app.
meaning that blows from the point opposite to the
corner, of the Kaabeh, that is between the Black
Stone and the door]; as though yearning towards
the House: (M, TA:) or, accord. to IAar, (M,)
the wind of which the place whence it blows
extends from the place of rising of الثُّرَيَّا [or the
Pleiades] to [the place of] بَنَات نَعْش [meaning
the tail of Ursa Major]: (M, K:) [it is often
commended by poets as a gentle and pleasant
gale, like the Zephyr with us:] the dual is
صَبَوَانِ and صَبَيَانِ: (Lh, M, K:) and pl. صَبَوَاتٌ
and أَصْبَآءٌ. (M, K.)
صِبًا [also written صِبًى] and ↓ صَبَآءٌ, the former

fet-h and the long alif, (S, Msb,) [both mentioned
before as inf. ns.,] Youth, or boyhood; the state
of the صَبِىّ [q. v.]: (S:) or childhood. (Msb.)
One says, كَانَ ذٰلِكَ فِى صِبَاهُ and صَبَائِهِ [That was
in his youth or boyhood: or in his childhood].
(Msb.) [See also an ex. in a verse cited in the
first paragraph of art. شفع.] ―
-b2-  And the former
[or each, as is shown in the first sentence of this
art.,] has also a signification derived from الشَّوْقُ
[or “ desire; ” i. e., each signifies also An inclining
to ignorant, or foolish, or silly, and youthful,
conduct; and amorous dalliance]: (S:) and ↓ صَبْوَةٌ
signifies [the same, as is also shown in the first
sentence of this art., or, like صِبًا and صَبَآءٌ,] the
ignorance, or foolishness, or silliness, of youth;
(Lth, M, K;) and amorous dalliance. (Lth, TA.)
[See an ex. of the first in a verse cited in the first
paragraph of art. ادى; and another in a verse
cited voce عَارَضَ.]
صَبْوَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
صَبَآءٌ: see صَبًا.
صَبِىٌّ A youth, boy, or male child; syn. غُلَامٌ:
(S:) or a young male child; (Mgh, Msb;) before he is called غُلَام: (Mgh:) or one that has
not yet been weaned, (M, K,) so called from the
time of his birth: (M:) and ↓ صَابٍ signifies the
same as صَبِىٌّ; these two words being like قَادِرٌ
and قَدِيرٌ: (TA:) the pl. of the former is صِبْيَةٌ [a
pl. of pauc., in which the و is changed into ى
because of the kesreh before it, like as is said in
the M respecting another of the pls.,] (S, M, Msb,
K, but not in the CK,) and صِبْوَةٌ (M, K, TA, in
the CK صَبْوَةٌ,) and صُبْيَةٌ (M, K) and صَبْيَةٌ, (K,
TA, but not in the CK,) [or rather the last two
are quasi-pl. ns.,] and أَصْبٍ [another pl. of pauc.]
(K) and أَصْبِيَةٌ [also a pl. of pauc.], (M, K,) but
this last is said by J to have been unused, because
the usage of صِبْيَةٌ rendered it needless, (TA,) and
صِبْيَانٌ, (S, M, Msb, K, but not in the CK,) in
which the و is changed into ى because of the
kesreh before it, (M,) and صُبْيَانٌ, (M, K,) as
some say, preserving the ى notwithstanding the
dammeh, (M,) and صِبْوَانٌ (M, K, but not in the
CK,) and صُبْوَانٌ: (M, K:) and [ISd says,]
accord. to Sb, the dim. of صِبْيَةٌ is ↓ أُصَيْبِيَةٌ, and
that of أَصْبِيَةٌ is ↓ صُبَيَّةٌ, each irreg.; but in my
opinion, صُبَيَّةٌ is the dim. of صِبْيَةٌ, and أُصَيْبِيَةٌ is
that of أَصْبِيَةٌ: (M:) [J says,] أُصَيْبِيَةٌ occurs in
poetry as being the dim. of أَصْبِيَةٌ. (S.) ↓ صَبِيَّةٌ
signifies A young woman, girl, or female child;
(S, TA;) and so too, [sometimes,] صَبِىٌّ: (TA:)
and the pl. is صَبَايَا. (S TA.) ―

term applied to The flatus, or flatulence, (الرِّيحُ,)
that is incident to children. (TA in art. ام.)

Meyd.: and also as meaning Epilepsy; on the
authority of Ibn-Beytár.] ―

i. e. (TA) الصَّبِيَّانِ signifies the two extremities of
the two jaw-bones (S, M, TA) of the camel and of
other animals: or, as some say, the two edges
curving outwards from the middle of the two
jaw-bones: (M, TA:) or, accord. to the A, the
thin portions of the two extremities thereof: and
it is [said to be] tropical. (TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  A bone
below the lobe, or lobule, of each of the two ears:

(tropical:)  The grains of hoar-frost that resemble pearls:
and صِبْيَانُ المَطَرِ (tropical:)  the small drops of rain: but
accord. to the author of the “ Khasáïl,” it is
صِئْبَان [pl. of صُؤَابَةٌ, q. v.], with ء and then ب.

-b3-  Kureysh, (M,) or the Jews, (TA,) used to call the
Companions of the Prophet صُبَاةٌ. (M, TA. [See
