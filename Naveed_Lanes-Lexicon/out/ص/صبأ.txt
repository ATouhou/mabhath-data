صبأ1

صَبَاَ, (M, K,) inf. n. صُبُوْءٌ,
(S, M, K, [in the last of which it is implied that
this verb in all its senses except the last has صَبْءٌ
also for an inf. n., and likewise صَبُؤَ as a syn.
form, but this I do not find authorized by any
other lexicon,]) said of the tush (S, M, K) of a
camel (S, M) and of a cloven-hoofed animal and
of a solid-hoofed animal, (M,) and said of a
cloven hoof, (K, [but this, I doubt not, is a
mistake, for in the place of صَبَأَ الظِّلْفُ والنَّابُ, the
reading in the K, I find in the M صَبَأَ نَابُ الظِّلْفِ
وَالخُفِّ وَالحَافِرِ, and the like in the L,]) It grew
forth; (M, K;) or its point, or extremity, grew
forth: (S:) and accord. to the K, it appears that
↓ اصبأ signifies the same; but this is not the case.

incisor] of a boy, It grew forth. (S.) ―

accord. to IAar, صَبَأَ عَلَيْهِ he came forth, or went
forth, upon him, or against him: and he inclined
against him with enmity: (TA:) or he came, or
came forth, upon him unexpectedly: whence, he
says, the word صُبًّا in the saying of the Prophet,
لَتَعُودُونَّ فِيهَا أَسَاوِدَ صُبًّا, [which see in art. صب,]
the said word being of the measure فُعَّلًا, [originally صُبَّأً,] and the ء being suppressed: (L in art.
صب:) and ↓ أَصْبَأَهُمْ signifies he came upon them

صَابِئٌ [part. n. of صَبَأَ: and as such signifying]
One who departs from his religion to another
religion. (Msb.) The Arabs used to call the
Prophet الصَّابِى [for الصَّابِئُ], because he departed
from the religion of Kureysh to El-Islám; and
him who entered the religion of El-Islám, مَصْبُوٌّ,
changing the ء to و; and the Muslims [collectively], الصُّبَاةٌ, as though pl. of الصَّابِىِ, without ء,
like قُضَاةٌ and غُزَاةٌ pls. of قَاضٍ and غَازٍ. (TA.)
And [the pl.] الصَّابِئُونَ in the Kur [v. 73, &c.,] is
said by Zj to mean Those who depart from one
religion to another. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Then this appellation, صَابِئٌ, was applied to [Any individual of] a
certain sect of the unbelievers, [the Sabians,] said
to worship the stars secretly, and openly to profess themselves to belong to the Christians: they
are called الصَّابِئَةُ and الضَّابِئُونَ: and they assert
that they are of the religion of Sábi the son of
Sheyth [or Seth] the son of Adam: their appellation may also be pronounced الصَّابِيُونَ, and thus
Náfi' read it [in the Kur]: (Msb:) or the
صَابِئُونَ are a certain class of the people who
possess revealed scripture: (S:) or a people whose
religion resembles that of the Christians, except
that their kibleh is towards the place whence blows
the [south, or southerly, wind called] جَنُوب:
(Lth, T, TA:) [or] whose kibleh is from (مِنْ [or
this may mean some point of]) the place whence
blows the [north, or northerly, wind called] شَمَال
at midday: (M, K:) or, accord. to some, their
kibleh is the Kaabeh: (MF:) and they assert that
they are of the religion of Noah, (Lth, T, M, K,)
lyingly: (Lth, T, M:) in the R it is said that
they are thus called in relation to Sábi the son of
Lámak [or Lamech], the brother of Noah: Bd
says, it is said that they are worshippers of the
angels: and it is said that they are worshippers of
the stars: and that their appellation is Arabic;
from صَبَأَ “ he departed from a religion; ” or from
صَبَا “ he inclined,” because of their inclining from
truth to falsehood. (MF, TA.)
