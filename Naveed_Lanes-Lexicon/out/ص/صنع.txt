صنع1
صَنَعَ الشَّىْءَ, aor.
صَنَعَ, inf. n. صُنْعٌ and صَنْعٌ,
He made, wrought, manufactured, fabricated, or
constructed, the thing; syn. عَمِلَهُ: (K:) [or he
made it, &c., skilfully, or well; for] الصُّنْعُ signifies إِجَادَةُ الفِعْلِ; and every صُنْع is a فِعْل, but
every فِعْل is not a صُنْع; and it is not predicated
of [irrational] animals [unless tropically, (see
أَصْنَعُ,)] nor of inanimate things, like as الفِعْلُ is.
(Er-Rághib, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] صَنَعَ signifies also
(assumed tropical:)  [He fabricated speech or a saying or sentence
or the like:] he forged a word; and poetry, عَلَى
فُلَانٍ in the name of such a one. (Mz, 8th نوع.)
―
-b3-  And صَنَعَ, inf. n. صَنْعٌ [and صُنْعٌ] and صَنِيعٌ,
[with the objective complement understood,] He
worked, or wrought; he practised, or exercised,
an art, a craft, or a manufacture. (MA.) ―
-b4-
And صَنَعَ إِلَيْهِ مَعْرُوفًا, (S, O, K,) aor. as above,
(K,) inf. n. صُنْعٌ, with damm, He did to him a
benefit, favour, or kind act: and صَنَعَ بِهِ صَنِيعًا
قَبِيحًا he did to him an evil, or a foul, deed: syn.
فَعَلَهُ: (S, O, K:) and one says also [in the former
of these two senses], عِنْدَهُ صَنِيعَةً ↓ اِصْطَنَعَ; (S,
Mgh, K;) syn. اِتَّخَذَهَا; (K;) or أَحْسَنَ إِلَيْهِ.
(Mgh.) The saying مَا صَنَعْتَ وَأَبَاكَ means مَعَ
أَبِيكَ [i. e. What didst thou together with thy
father?]. (S.) The saying of the Prophet,
إِذَا لَمْ تَسْتَحْىِ فَاصْنَعْ مَا شِئْتَ [If thou be not
ashamed, do what thou wilt,] is said to be an
instance of an imperative phrase of which the
meaning is predicative; i. e. it is as though he
said, he who is not ashamed does what he will:
(O, L, TA: *) and other explanations of it are
mentioned in the O and L: (TA:) [but] this is
held by A 'Obeyd to be the right meaning. (L.)
In the phrase صُنْعَ اللّٰهِ, in the Kur [xxvii. 90,
which may be rendered By the doing of God],
صنع is in the accus. case as an inf. n.: but one
may read it in the nom. case, meaning ذٰلِكَ to be
understood before it. (Zj, O, TA.) One says also,
مَا أَحْسَنَ صُنْعَ اللّٰهِ عِنْدَكَ and صَنِيعَ اللّٰهِ [How good
is the doing of God with thee, or at thine abode!].
(K.) ―
-b5-  And صَنَعْتُ فَرَسِى, inf. n. صَنْعٌ and صَنْعَةٌ,
(tropical:)  I tended well my horse; or took good care of
him; (S, O, K, TA;) supplied him with fodder,
and fattened him: and صَنَعَ جَارِيَتَهُ (tropical:)  he reared,
or nourished, his girl, or young woman: (TA:)
and صُنِعَتِ الجَارِيَةُ (tropical:)  the girl, or young woman,
was treated [or nourished] well, so that she became
fat; as also ↓ صُنِّعَت, inf. n. تَصْنِيعٌ: (K, TA:)
or you say اِصْنَعِ الفَرَسَ, (so accord. to my MS.
copy of the K,) or الفَرَسَ ↓ أَصْنَعَ, (so accord. to
other copies of the K, and in the O, [in the CK
اُصْنِعَ الفَرَسُ,]) without teshdeed; [which seems to
indicate that the right reading is صَنَعَ, agreeably
with the reading in my MS. copy of the K which
gives the imperative form; though it is stated in
the TA that أَصْنَعَ الفَرَسَ is said by IKtt to be a
dial. var. of صَنَعَهُ;] (O, K;) and الجَارِيَةَ ↓ صَنَّعَ,
with teshdeed, meaning he treated [or nourished]
well the girl, or young woman, and fattened her;
(O, K; [in my MS. copy of the K صَنِّعِ الجَارِيَةَ;])
because the تصنيع of the girl, or young woman,
is by means of many things, and by careful
tending: (O, K:) so says Lth: (O:) but Az says
that by other, or others, than Lth, it is allowed to
say صَنَعَ جَارِيَتَهُ, without teshdeed: and hence the
phrase in the Kur [xx. 40.], وَلِتُصْنَعَ عَلَى عَيْنِى,
(TA,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  [And this I did] that thou
mightest be reared and nourished in my sight;
(O, TA;) for which some read وَلِْتُصْنَعْ, as an
imperative; and some, وَلِتَصْنَعَ, meaning and that
thou mightest work in my sight, (Ksh, Bd,) lest
thou shouldst do so contrary to my command.
(Bd.) You say likewise, of a woman, صَنَعَتْ نَفْسَهَا:
see 5. And you say also ↓ اِصْطَنَعْتُهُ, meaning (tropical:)  I
reared him; and educated, disciplined, or trained,
him well. (S, * O, K, TA.)
-A2-  Accord. to IDrst,
صَنِعَ, inf. n. صَنَعٌ, signifies He was, or became,
skilled, or skilful: but IB says that صَنِعَ has not
been heard. (TA.)
2
صَنَّعَ see 1, latter half, in two places.
3
مُصَانَعَةٌ primarily signifies The doing to one
a thing in order that he may do another thing to
the doer of the former thing. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence,
(TA,) (assumed tropical:)  The treating with gentleness, or blandishment; soothing, coaxing, wheedling, or cajoling;
and endeavouring to conciliate. (O, K, TA.) Or
this is from the last of the following significations.
(TA.) You say صانعهُ (assumed tropical:)  He treated him with
gentleness, or blandishment; &c. (O, TA.) And
(assumed tropical:)  He acted hypocritically with him. (TA.) And
صانعهُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ (assumed tropical:)  He strove, or endeavoured, to
turn him from the thing by deceit, or guile.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And hence, (A, TA,) or from the last
signification in this paragraph, (TA,) (tropical:)  The act of
bribing. (S, O, Msb, * K, * TA.) One says, صانع
الوَالِىَ (tropical:)  He bribed [the prefect, ruler, judge, or the
like]. (TA.) And صانعهُ بِالمَالِ (tropical:)  He bribed him
with property, wealth, or money. (Mgh, TA. *)
And it is said in a prov., مَنْ صَانَعَ بِالمَالِ لَمْ
يَحْتَشِمْ مِنْ طَلَبِ الحَاجَةِ (tropical:)  [He who bribes with
property is not ashamed of demanding the thing
wanted]. (S, O, TA.) ―
-b4-  Also (tropical:)  A horse's not
putting forth, or giving, the whole of his strength
in going; reserving somewhat thereof: one says,
يُصَانِعُكَ بِبَذْلِهِ سَيْرَهُ (tropical:)  [He keeps back from thee
somewhat by the manner in which he exerts his
power of going]. (O, K, TA.)
4
اصنع He (a man, O) aided, or assisted,
another. (O, K.) And accord. to Ibn-'Abbád,
followed in the O and TS and K, one says also,
اصنع الأَخْرَقُ, meaning The unskilful learned, and
did soundly, thoroughly, skilfully, or well: but
this is a mistake, occasioned by his deeming
dubious, or obscure, a passage in the Nawádir of
IAar, where the latter says that اصنع الرَّجُلُ
means أَعَانَ الأَخْرَقَ [i. e. The man aided, or
assisted, the unskilful]. (TA.)
-A2-  اصنع الفَرَسَ:
see 1, latter half. [Freytag states, as on the
authority of the K, that أَصْنَعَ, said of a horse,
signifies “ Non omnibus viribus usus cucurrit, sed
ita tamen ut eques eo contentus esset ” (which is
nearly the same as a signification of صَانَعَ likewise
mentioned by him): but this is a mistake.]
5
تَصَنُّعٌ signifies The affecting a goodly way,
mode, or manner, of acting, or conduct, or the
like; (S, O, K, TA; [الصَّمْت in the CK is a mistranscription for السَّمْت;]) and the making a show
thereof; (TA;) and the adorning oneself (K, TA)
thereby, while internally unsound in the grounds
of pretension to respect. (TA.) And تصنّعت,
said of a woman, means نَفْسَهَا ↓ صَنَعَتْ [She cultivated and improved her person, so as to render
herself comely, by art, and good nurture]: (S,
O:) or she adorned, or embellished, herself.
(PS.)
8
إِصْتَنَعَ see 1, former half. ―
-b2-  Accord. to Er-Rághib,
اِصْطِنَاعٌ signifies The exceeding the usual, or
ordinary, bounds, or degree, in putting a thing
into a good, sound, right, or proper, state.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And hence, he says, the phrase in the
Kur [xx. 43], وَاصْطَنَعْتُكَ لِنَفْسِى, which means
(assumed tropical:)  And I have chosen thee [for myself] to establish my evidence and to serve as my spokesman
between me and my creatures so that thy doing
thus shall be as though I did it: (TA:) or it
means I have reared thee, (Az, TA,) or I have
chosen thee, (O, K, TA,) [for myself,] for a
special affair which I require thee to accomplish
in a sufficient manner, (Az, O, K, TA,) concerning Pharaoh and his forces. (Az, TA.) See
also 1, last sentence but one. ―
-b4-  One says also,
اصطنع خَاتَمًا He ordered that a signet-ring
should be made for him. (O, K.) [See also 10.]
―
-b5-  And اصطنعهُ [in which the pronoun seems to
refer to رِزْق i. e. sustenance, &c.,] also signifies
قَدَّمَهُ [app. meaning He offered it]. (TA.) ―
-b6-
And اصطنع [alone, for اصطنع مَصْنَعَةً,] (tropical:)  He
made, or prepared, a repast, feast, or banquet,
to which to invite friends. (O, K, TA.) And
(tropical:)  He prepared food to be dispensed in the way, or
cause, of God. (O and TA, from a trad.; mentioned also in the CK, but not in other copies of
the K.)
10
استصنعهُ, accord. to the O, signifies He
asked for it to be made for him: accord. to the L,
استصنع الشَّىْءَ signifies he invited, or he induced,
or caused (دَعَا,) [another] to make the thing.
(TA.) In the saying of Es-Sarakhsee, اِسْتَصْنَعَ
عِنْدَ الرَّجُلِ قَلَنْسُوَةً [app. meaning He asked, or
desired, the man to make for him a قلنسوة (q. v.)],
عند is redundant. (Mgh.) [See also 8.]

-A2-  Also, and
↓ صَوْنَعٌ, A certain small creeping thing, or insect,
(دُوَيْبَّةٌ,) or a flying thing (طَائِرٌ): (K, TA:) mentioned by Sgh: (TA:) also written in the K (in

other mistranscribed. (TA in art. ضتع.)

delicate, (رَقِيق, so in the copies of the K,) or
slender, or small, (دَقِيق, so in the TA,) [of which
readings that in the O is app. the right,] in
respect of the hands. (O, K.) See also صَنَعٌ, in
five places.
-A2-  Also A ↓ مَصْنَعَة of water; (O,
K, TA;) i. e. a piece of wood [app. a plank or
board] by means of which water is confined, and
retained for a while: (TA:) pl. أَصْنَاعٌ: (O, K:)
[but this explanation in the TA seems to have
been founded upon a statement there made, that
Az heard the Arabs call أَحْبَاس of water أَصْنَاع;
(see حِبْسٌ, of which احباس is the pl.;) for I do
not find ↓ مَصْنَعَةٌ thus expl. in any lexicon except
the TA:] and ↓ صَنَّاعَةٌ, with teshdeed, and ↓ صَنَاعٌ,
(O, K,) like سَحَابٌ, (K,) accord. to Lth, (O,)
signify pieces of wood [or planks or boards] put
together in water, to confine the water, and retain
it for a while; (O, K;) like the حِبَاسَة [q. v.].

TA.) ―
-b5-  And (tropical:)  A turban. (IAar, O, K, TA.) ―

And The [iron instrument with which flesh-meat
is roasted, called] سَفُّود. (O, TS, K.) El-Marrár

وَجَآءَتْ وَرُكْبَانُهَا كَالشُّرُوبِ
وَسَائِقُهَا مِثْلُ صِنْعِ الشِّوَآء
[And they came, their riders being like drinkers,
or drunkards, and their driver like the سَفُّود of
roasted flesh-meat]. (O.) In the L, السود is put
in the place of السفّود; and after citing the verse
above, [and app. reading مِثْلَ, regarding it as
relating to the camels,] the author says that the
poet means, سُودَ الأَلْوَانِ. (TA.) ―
-b7-  And Roasted
flesh-meat [itself]; syn. شِوَآءٌ. (So in copies of
the K. [SM says that the right reading, as the
explanation of الصِّنْعُ in this instance, is الشَّوَا; and
cites IAar as saying الصِّنْعُ الشَّوَا نَفْسُهُ: but I
think that the right reading is indicated by the
addition نَفْسُهُ to be الشِّوَآءُ; and that IAar gives
this signification after mentioning that which here
next precedes it.])

إِنَّ الصَّنِيعَةَ لا تَكُونُ صَنِيعَةً
حَتَّى يُصَابَ بِهَا طَرِيقُ المَصْنَعِ
[which may be rendered Verily that which is a
good deed considered abstractedly, or without relation to the manner or object &c., will not be a
good deed in effect except, or unless, the way of
the doing, or the way that leads to the place (here
meaning the object) of the doing, be rightly hit
upon therewith]. (O, TA.) ―
-b2-  In the following
verse of Náfi' Ibn-Lakeet, (TA in this art. and
in art. ريش,) wrongly ascribed by J [in arts.
ريش and مرط] to Lebeed, (TA in art. ريش,) and
ascribed by others to other poets, (TA in art.
مرط,) it is expl. by IAar as signifying A place
that is deemed goodly [in workmanship]; syn.
مُسْتَمْلَحٌ [a n. of place, accord. to a general rule,
as well as pass. part. n.: or مَصْنَعٌ may be here
more literally rendered a place of skilful workmanship]: the poet says,
مُرُطُ القِذَاذِ فَلَيْسَ فِيهِ مَصْنَعٌ
لَا الرِّيشُ يَنْفَعُهُ وَلَا التَّعْقِيبُ
(TA in the present art.) meaning Having no
feathers upon it, [and having in it no place exhibiting skilful workmanship, neither the feathers
being of use to it] nor the binding around with
sinews. (TA in art. ريش.) ―

مَصَانِعُ, (O, Msb, K, TA,) a pl. of all the three
words above, expl. by As as meaning excavations
which people make for the rain-water, which
they fill therewith, and from which they drink;
and مَصَانِيعُ is another pl. of مَصْنَعَةٌ, the ى being
inserted by poetic license; or it may be pl. of
↓ مَصْنُوعٌ or مَصْنُوعَةٌ: and ↓ صِنْعٌ [in like manner]
signifies a حَوْض or a thing like a صِهْرِيج: and
صُنُوعٌ is said to be a pl. thereof: (TA:) or صِنْعٌ

the rain-water, and not cased with baked bricks;
and its pl. is أَصْنَاعٌ. (TA voce بِرْكَةٌ.) See also

also Constructions such as قُصُور [or pavilions,
&c.], (O, K,) and fortresses; (S, O, K;) and
↓ صِنْعٌ also signifies a fortress: and the former,
wells also. (TA.) And Towns, or villages, are
thus called, (O, K,) by the Arabs, accord. to As:
sing. مَصْنَعَةٌ: (O, TA:) one says, هُوَ مِنْ أَهْلِ
المَصَانِعِ, meaning He is of the people of the towns,
or villages, and of the cultivated land. (A, TA.)
Also Places set apart for horses, away from the
