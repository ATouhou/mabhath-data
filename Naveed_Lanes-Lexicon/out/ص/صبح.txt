indicated, but not expressed:]) or he entered upon
the time of daybreak, or dawn, the time termed
صُبْح. (L, K.) By the following words of EshShemmákh,

is meant, [And the saying of the crier is,] The
people, or party, have nearly entered upon the
time of dawn: prosecute the night-journey: for
the Arabs, when they have nearly arrived at a
place which they desire to reach, say, قَدْ بَلَغْنَاهُ;

victorious. (Bd.) And فَأَصْبَحَ يُقَلِّبُ كَفَّيْهِ, in

thou wouldst not see aught save their dwellingplaces; or, as Hamzeh and Ks read, لَا يُرَى إِلَّا
مَسَاكِنُهُمْ [there was not to be seen aught save their
dwelling-places]. (Bd.) [أَصْبَحَ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا is of
frequent occurrence, meaning He became occupied, or engaged, in doing such a thing; he betook,
set, or applied, himself to doing such a thing; set
about, or commenced, doing such a thing; or
began to do such a thing.] ―

the former: see صَبُحَ]. (A, TA.)
8
اصطبح He drank a morning-draught, or
what is termed a صَبُوح; (S, K, TA;) [and] so
↓ اصبح. (Msb. [Thus in my copy of the Msb,
but probably a mistranscription, for the former is
the verb well known in this sense, and is not in
that copy.]) It is said in a trad., مَالَنَا صَبِىٌّ يَصْطَبِحُ
[We have not a child that drinks a morningdraught]; meaning we have not as much milk as
a child may drink in the early morning, in consequence of the drought. (TA.)
-A2-  And i. q. أَسْرَجَ
[as meaning He lighted a lamp or wick, or himself or another with a lamp &c.]; (K, TA;) and
so ↓ اصبح (A, TA) [in the former sense], as in
the phrase اصبح مِصْبَاحًا [he lighted a lamp or
wick]; (A;) and اصبح alone has this meaning,
i. e. أَسْرَجَ سِرَاجًا. (TA, from a trad.) [But it is
used often in the latter sense:] one says, الشَّمْعُ
مِمَّا يُصْطَبَحُ بِهِ Candles are of the things with
which one lights [himself, or others]; syn. يُسْرَجُ:
(S:) [and in like manner ↓ تصبّح; for] one says,
هُوَ يَتَصَبَّحُ بِالشُّمُوعِ [He lights himself, or others,
with candles]: (A:) [and in like manner also
↓ استصبح; for] one says, استصبح بِالمِصْبَاحِ (S,
MA, Mgh, Msb, K *) He lighted [himself, or
another,] with the lamp, or wick; (MA;) syn.
أَسْرَجَ; (S;) or اِسْتَسْرَجَ: (K:) [hence it appears
that اصطبح بِهِ and به ↓ استصبح and به ↓ تصبّح
may be aptly rendered he employed it as a means
of light; and thus the second of these three verbs,
is expl. in treatises on practical law:] one says
also, بِالدُّهْنِ ↓ استصبح [He employed oil as a
means of light; or] he made the lamp, or wick, to
give light by means of oil: (Mgh, Msb:) and it
is said in a trad. respecting the several sorts of
fat (شُحُوم) of carrion, بِهَا النَّاسُ ↓ يَسْتَصْبِحُ The
people [employ them as means of light; or] make
their lamps, or wicks, to give light by means of
them. (TA.)

“ or ”) the beginning, or first part, of day: (Msb,
K:) ↓ إِصْبَاحٌ is an inf. n. [inf. n. of أَصْبَحَ] used
in the sense of صُبْح, in the Kur vi. 96, (Jel,) and
is similar to إِبْكَارٌ; (TA;) [and ↓ مُصْبَحٌ is the n. of
place and time from أَصْبَحَ:] the pl. of صُبْحٌ is
أَصْبَاحٌ; (K;) and thus some read in the Kur vi. 96.
(Bd.) See also أَصْبَحُ. One says, أَتَيْتُهُ لِصُبْحِ
خَامِسَةٍ and خامسة ↓ لِصِبْحِ, (S, K,) meaning [I
came to him] in the morning (صَبَاح) [of the last]
of five days; (K;) i. e., of a fifth day; (TK;)

sunrise; syn. ضُحًى; as also ↓ صَبْحَةٌ: (Msb:) or

upon the dawn or forenoon]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And A
sleep in the morning, or first part of day, before
sunrise; as also ↓ صَبْحَةٌ; (S, * K;) or both signify
a sleep in the ضُحَى [expl. above]; (A;) but the
latter is by some disapproved: such sleep is forbidden in a trad., because it is in a time for the
commemoration of the praises of God and then
for seeking gain. (TA.) One says, فُلَانٌ يَنَامُ
الصُّبْحَةَ and ↓ الصَّبْحَةَ [Such a one sleeps in the

صَبِحَ,] Blackness inclining to redness: (K:) or
intense redness in the hair: (Lth, TA:) or a colour

or nearly the same as صُهْبَة: (Lth, * S, * TA:) or
a colour inclining to that termed شُهْبَة: (K,
TA:) or whiteness that is not clear, or pure; so
the former is expl. by Suh. (TA. [See also
أَصَبَحُ.])
صَبْحَانُ A man who has drunk a morningdraught, or what is termed a صَبُوح; (TA;) or
who has done so, and satisfied his thirst thereby:
(Aboo-'Adnán, TA:) [in the S and K it is implied that it is syn. with مُصْطَبِحٌ, q. v.:] fem.
صَبْحَى. (S, TA.) Hence the prov., أَكْذَبُ مِنَ
الأَخِيذِ الصَّبْحَانِ (Aboo-'Adnán, S, TA) More
lying than the captive who had satisfied his thirst
with a morning-draught: (Aboo-'Adnán, TA:)
the person thus alluded to was a man who was
among a people that gave him a morning-draught,
after which he arose and quitted them, and was
taken by another people, who said to him,
“ Guide us to the place where thou wast; ” to
which he replied, “I have passed the night in
the bare desert: ” but presently he sat down to
make water, so they knew that he had passed the
night with a people near by; and by his means
they found their way to them, and exterminated
them: (IAar, TA:) or the prov. is أَكْذَبُ مِنَ
الأَخِدِ الصَّبْحَانِ More lying than the young unweaned camel that has satisfied its thirst with
drinking [its mother's milk in the morning];
which [seems to be thirsty but] will not drink of
its mother's milk when one desires it to do so:
(IAar, Sh, TA:) or, accord. to Fr, than the young
unweaned camel that is affected with indigestion,
or heaviness of the stomach, from drinking much
milk, and therefore craves for milk again. (Meyd.

have followed a faulty text.]) ―

Morning, or forenoon, counted from sunrise to

some, from midnight to noon: (TA in art. مسو:)
or, accord. to the Arabs, from the beginning of
the latter half of the night to the time when the
sun declines from the meridian; then commences
the مَسَآء, extending to the end of the former half
of the night; thus expl. by Th; so says El-Jawá-
leekee. (Msb.) The Arabs say, when they
regard a man, &c., as ominous of evil, صَبَاحُ
اللّٰهِ لَا صَبَاحُكَ [God's morning: not thy morning]:
and if you will, you may say, صَبَاحَ اللّٰهِ لَا صَبَاحَكَ.
(Lh, TA.) And عِمْ صَبَاحًا, (S,) or عِمُوا صَبَاحًا,
(K,) lit. imperative, but meaning a prayer, i. e.
May thy life, or your life, be pleasant during the
morning, (Har p. 32, and TA * in arts. نعم and
وعم,) is a salutation of the people of the Time of
Ignorance. (TA.) One says also, لَقِيتُهُ صَبَاحًا,
and ذَا صَبَاحٍ, (S,) or أَتَيْتُهُ ذَا صَبَاحٍ, (K,) which
[i. e. ذا صباح] is only used adverbially, (Sb, S,
K,) except in the dial. of Khath'am, (Sb, S,)
meaning [I met him, or I came to him,] in a
morning, [or] between daybreak and sunrise:
(K:) the following verse (S, TA) by Anas Ibn-Nuheyk, of Khath'am, (TA,) or, as some say,
by Iyás Ibn-Mudrikeh El-Hanafee, (so in a marg.
note in a copy of the S,) presents an exception to
the adverbial usage:
عَزَمْتُ عَلَى إِقَامَةِ ذِى صَبَاحٍ
لِأَمْرٍ مَّا يُسَوَّدُ مَنْ يَسُودُ
(S, TA:) the poet means, I determined to stay
until the time of the صباح [i. e. either dawn or
forenoon]: for it is on account of some particular
thing, i. e. some good quality, or some praiseworthy thing, that he is made a chief who becomes
a chief: thus Ibn-Es-Seeráfee explains this verse.
(TA.) And one says, ↓ أَتَيْتُهُ ذَا صَبُوحٍ, not used
otherwise than adverbially, meaning the same as
ذَا صَبَاحٍ, expl. above; (K;) and ↓ ذَاتَ الصَّبُوحِ in
the morning, or first part of day, before sunrise: (IAar, TA:) or ↓ ذَا صَبُوحٍ [properly means]
in a time of drinking the [morning-draught called]
صَبُوح. (TA.) And يَوْمِ كَذَا ↓ أَتَيْتُهُ صَبِيحَةَ [I
came to him in the dawn, or in the morning, or
forenoon, of such a day]: (A:) and ↓ أُصْبُوحَةَ
كُلِّ يَوْمٍ [in the morning of every day]; and in
like manner, أُمْسِيَّةَ كُلِّ يَوْمٍ. (S.) And أَتَيْتُهُ
صَبَاحَ مَسَآءَ, (Sb, A, TA,) for صَبَاحًا وَمَسَآءً, [I came
to him morning and evening,] meaning every
morning and evening: (Sharh esh-Shudhoor, p.
31:) the two nouns are thus constructed by some
of the Arabs, after the manner of خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ: but
some prefix the former noun to the other, putting
the latter in the gen. case, except when the expression is used as a denotative of state, or adverbially: (TA:) [or, accord. to IHsh,] صَبَاحَ
مَسَآءٍ is allowable as [an adverbial expression]
meaning صَبَاحَ ذَا مَسَآءٍ [lit. in a morning having
an evening, or in a forenoon having an afternoon];
and a similar instance occurs in the Kur, ch.
lxxix. last verse. (Sharh esh-Shudhoor, ubi
suprà.) ―
-b3-  يَوْمُ الصَّبَاحِ means (tropical:)  The day of the
hostile, or predatory, incursion. (S, A, K.) The
Arabs, when suddenly attacked in the morning
by a troop of horsemen, cry aloud, يَا صَبَاحَاهْ
(assumed tropical:)  [O! a hostile, or predatory, incursion!]; warning the whole tribe: (TA:) this is said by him
who calls for aid: (JM:) for they generally made
a hostile, or predatory, incursion in the morning:
(TA, JM:) or, as some say, the two conflicting
parties used, when night came, to abstain; and
when day returned, they recommenced; so that
the case is as though he who said thus meant,
The time of the صَبَاح [or morning] has come,
therefore prepare yourselves for fighting. (JM.)

[or lamp]. (K.) [See also مِصْبَاحٌ.]

thou make a delicate allusion to a morningdraught?] is a prov., [the origin of which is expl.
in art. رق, q. v.,] applied to him who speaks
obscurely, not plainly; and to him who alludes
ambiguously to some great thing or affair; and to
him who by blandishing expressions makes a
thing incumbent on thee which is not really so.
