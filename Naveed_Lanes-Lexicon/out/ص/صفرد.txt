صفردصِفْرِدٌ A certain bird, (S, M, K,) of a cowardly
nature, (K,) larger than the sparrow, (M,) that
frequents houses, and is the most cowardly of
birds; (Lth;) it is afraid of the [little bird called]
صَعْوَة; (IAar;) and is by the vulgar (S) called
أَبُو المَلِيحِ. (S, K. [Accord. to Golius, the
nightingale: but this I think a mistake.]) أَجْبَنُ
مِنْ صِفْرِدٍ [More cowardly than a sifrid] is a
prov., (S, Meyd,) asserted by AO to be postclassical. (Meyd. [See Freytag's Arab. Prov. i.
