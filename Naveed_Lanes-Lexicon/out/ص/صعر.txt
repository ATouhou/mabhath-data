to AA: (S:) or the pl. signifies concrete gum
resembling fingers: and صعرور is said to signify

a mark of the people of El-Yemen, only made
upon she-camels: (Tedhkireh of Aboo-'Alee:)
not upon a camel whether male or female, (K,) as
it is said to be by A'Obeyd [and J]. (TA.) J
was led into error by a verse of El-Museiyab (K)
Ibn 'Alas; wherein he uses the phrase بِنَاجٍ عَلَيْهِ
الصَّيْعَرِيَّةُ [With a swift he-camel marked with the
صيعريّة]; (TA;) on hearing which, Tarafeh (K)
Ibn-El-'Abd (TA) said, قَدِ اسْتَنْوَقَ الجَمَلُ [The
male camel has assumed the characteristic of the
female camel]. (K, TA.) El-Bedr El-Karáfee
urges that the term بَعِير, used by J, includes the
female; and that the masc. epithet [نَاجٍ] is used
[by the poet] because the male is the more honourable, being more hardy, and stronger than the
female: but this demands consideration. (TA.)
أَصْعَرُ Having a wryness, or distortion, in the
cheek, (S,) or in the face, (A, K,) or in either side
[thereof], (K,) or in the neck, (A, Msb,) by
reason of pride, (A,) with a turning of the face
on one side: (Msb:) or a camel having a disorder
by reason of which he twists his neck, (K,) and
distorts it: (TA:) sometimes the being so is
natural (S, A, Msb, K) in a man (S, Msb) and in
an ostrich; (S, A, Mgh;) and sometimes it is
accidental: (Msb:) pl. صُعْرٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  It occurs
in a trad. as signifying Such as withdraws himself [from others, through pride]; syn. ذَاهِبٌ
بِنَفْسِهِ: (S, TA: [thought by Ibr D to be a
mistake for زَاهٍ بِنَفْسِهِ: but this seems to me
improbable:]) or such as turns away his face, by
reason of pride: (IAth:) and in another trad. as
signifying such as turns away from the truth, and
is faulty. (TA.)
مُصْعَرٌّ, (S,) in the K مُصْعَرٌ, said to be like مُكْرَمٌ,
but the former is the right, as is shown by the
ex. below, (TA,) applied to a night-journey to
water, Hard, or severe. (S, K.) A poet says,
وَقَدْ قَرَبْنَ قَرَبًا مُصْعَرَّا
[And they had performed a hard night-journey

مُصَعْرَرٌ [Made round: and simply, round]. A
rájiz says,
سُودٌ كَحَبِّ الفُلْفُلِ المُصَعْرَرِ
[Black, like the round grains of pepper]. (S.)
