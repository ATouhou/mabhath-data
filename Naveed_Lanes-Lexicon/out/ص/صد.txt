صدّدهُ عَنْهُ: see 1.
-A2-  And صدّد, (T, TA,)
inf. n. تَصْدِيدٌ; for which one says صدّد, inf. n.
تَصْدِيَةٌ, (T, M, * K, * TA,) changing one of the
دs into ى, (T, K, TA,) like as one says قَصَّيْتُ
أَظْفَارِى, which is originally قَصَّصْتُ; (T, TA;)
and صَدَّى بِيَدَيْهِ; (TA in art. صدى;) He
clapped with his hands; (T, M, K;) because, in
the action of clapping the hands together, the
صَدّ, i. e. “ face,” of one hand fronts that of the
other; or, accord. to Aboo-Jaafar Er-Rustamee,
التَّصْدِيَةُ is from صَدًى meaning “ a sound ” [or
“ an echo ”]; but the former derivation is the
more probable: (TA:) [see art. صدى:] also he
raised his voice, or called out, or cried out. (M,
TA.) It is said in the Kur [viii. 35], وَمَا كَانَ
صَلَاتُهُمْ عِنَدْ الْبَيْتِ إِلَّا مُكَآءً وَتَصْدِيَةً And their
prayer at the House [of God] is nought but
whistling, and clapping with the hands: (M, *

they have been commanded to do. (Jel.)

(Az, L;) He addressed, or applied, or directed,
himself, or his regard, or attention, or mind, to

originally تَتَصَدَّدُ, (L,) and accord. to one reading
تَصَّدَّى, (Jel,) means To him thou addressest
thyself, or directest thine attention, and inclinest;
syn. تَتَعَرَّضُ لَهُ, (L,) and تُقْبِلُ عَلَيْهِ, (Zj,) and
تَمِيلُ إِلَيْهِ; (L;) or تَتَعَرَّضُ لَهُ بِالْإِقْبَالِ عَلَيْهِ: (Bd:)

(M in art. صدى: [in which, however, this explanation is not given with express reference to
