صَيْفٌ as signifying A certain portion of the
year is said by ISk to be fem.: (TA, voce شِتَآءٌ;
q. v.:) [but by others I find it treated as masc.:]
the صَيْف as meaning one of the seasons is well
known: (M:) Lth says, it is one of the quarters
of the year; and is applied by the vulgar to a
half of the year [i. e. to the half-year commencing
at the vernal equinox; the other half-year being
called by them the شِتَآء]: Az says, it is, with the
Arabs, the division which the vulgar in El-'Irák
and Khurásán call the رَبِيع [i. e. the spring]; it
consists of three months; and the division that
next follows it is with the Arabs the قَيْظ; and in
it is the جَمْرَة [q. v.] of the قِيْظ; then, after this,
is the division called the خَرِيف; and then, after
this, the division called the شِتَآء: (TA:) [i. e.] it
is the quarter of the year vulgarly called the رَبِيع,
commencing when the sun enters Aries: but is
applied by the vulgar to the قَيْظ, which is the
[summer, i. e.] the quarter commencing when the
sun enters Cancer: (Msb in art. زمن; q. v.:) [F
says,] the صَيْف is the قَيْظ [i. e. summer, or the
hot season]; or [the season] after the رَبِيع: (K:)
and [Sgh says,] the صَيْف is one of the divisions
of the year; which is after the رَبِيع: (O:) [but
unless this explanation in the O denote only a
vulgar meaning, and the latter of the two explanations in the K be virtually a repetition, we
must suppose that, in each of them, by the ربيع is
meant the season of rain thus termed, which ends
in March: (see the latter of the two tables which
I have inserted voce زَمَنٌ:) most probably, I
think, both have been faultily transcribed from
what here follows; for the S is largely copied in
the O, and the S and O are among the principal sources of the K, which generally follows
the O when it differs (rightly or wrongly) from
the S:] the صَيْف is one of the divisions of the
year; which is after [that called] الرَّبِيعُ الأَوَّلُ and
before [that called] القَيْظُ: (S:) [this admits of two
renderings, both of which are correct; namely,
the quarter after the season of two months called
الربيع الاوّل (which ends in March) and before
the quarter called القيظ (which is summer); and
also the season of two months after that called
الربيع الاوّل and before the similar season called
القيظ: (see the former of the two tables to which
I have referred above:) but probably the latter
only was meant by him who first gave. this
explanation:] the pl. is أَصْيَافٌ (M, O, K) and
صُيُوفٌ: (M, Msb:) ↓ صَيْفَةٌ is a more particular
term [app. meaning A single صَيْف; (see 2;)];
it is like شَتْوَةٌ [q. v.]; (O, K;) and its pl. is صِيَفٌ,
like بِدَرٌ pl. of بَدْرَةٌ. (Fr, O, K.) الصَّيْفَ ضَيَّعْتِ
اللَّبَنَ is a saying expl. in art. ضيع [q. v.]. (O,
K.) ―
-b2-  الصَّيْفُ also signifies The rain that comes
in the [season called] صَيْف; (S, O, Msb, K;)
[see, again, the second of the tables to which I
have referred above, and see also نَوْ ٌ;] and (O,
K) so ↓ الصَّيِّفُ; (M, O, K;) also signifying the
herbage thereof: (M:) or, (K,) accord. to Lth,
(O,) the latter signifies the rain that falls after
the division [a mistake for the rain] called the
رَبِيع; (O, K;) and so the former; (K;) and it is
also called ↓ الصَّيْفِىُّ; (O, K;) which likewise
signifies the herbage thereof. (TA.) Hence the
prov., relating to the completing of the performance of a needful affair, تَمَامُ الرَّبِيعِ الصَّيْفُ [The
completion of the rain called the ربيع is that called
the صيف]: for the rain called the ربيع is the first
rain, and the صيف is that which is [next] after it.

-b3-  آيَةُ الصَّيْفِ is [A verse] in the end (آخِر)

or goat: see صَفَرِىٌّ.] ―
-b3-  And [hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A son

old, or advanced in age. (S, M, O.) [See an ex.
in a verse cited voce رِبْعِىٌّ.] ―

near the end of the paragraph. ―
-b5-  صَيْفِيَّةٌ [used as
a subst., or as an epithet in which the quality of
a subst. is predominant, for مِيرَةٌ صَيْفِيَّةٌ,] and
↓ صَائِفَةٌ signify The مِيرَة [or provision of corn &c.]
in the first part of the صَيْف [here meaning
spring]; i. e. the second ميرة; for the first of the
مِيرَ is the رِبْعِيَّة, then the صَيْفِيَّة, then the دَفَئِيَّة,
and then the رَمَضِيَّة: (M:) or the ↓ صَائِفَة of a
people is their مِيرَة in the صَيْف. (S, O, K.) [See
مِيرَةٌ.] ―
-b6-  [صَيْفِيَّةٌ is also applied to The latter, or
last, season of the bringing forth of camels; so in
an explanation of هُبَعٌ in the S and TA.]
صَيْفِيَّةٌ [fem. of صَيْفِىٌّ: and also used as a subst.,
or as an epithet in which the quality of a subst. is
predominant: see the latter word].
صَائِفٌ is used as an imitative sequent in the
phrase صَيْفٌ صَائِفٌ, (S, O, K,) meaning A warm,
or hot, [spring or] summer: (PS:) a phrase like
لَيْلٌ لَائِلٌ &c. (S, O.) And one says يَوْمٌ صَائِفٌ,
(S, M, O, Msb, K,) meaning A hot day; (O,
K;) and ↓ يَوْمٌ صَافٌ (S, O, K) was sometimes
said, meaning صَائِفٌ; like يَوْمٌ رَاحٌ [as meaning
رَائِحٌ]: (S:) and لَيْلَةٌ صَائِفَةٌ [a hot night]. (S, O,
Msb.) ―
-b2-  And مَطَرٌ صَائِفٌ [app. Rain coming in
the صَيْف, meaning spring; as also ↓ مُصِيفٌ,
occurring in a verse cited voce رَسَمَ, q. v.]. (M.)
See also صَافٍ in art. صفو.
صَائِفَةٌ [fem. of صَائفٌ, q. v. ―
-b2-  Also, as a subst.,]
A warring, or warring and plundering, expedition in the صَيْف [i. e. either spring or summer]: (M, Mgh, and Ham p. 239:) pl. صَوَائِفُ.
(Mgh, and Ham ib.) And [particularly] (Mgh)
A warring, or warring and plundering, expedition against the Greeks (الرُّوم): because they
[i. e. the Arabs] used to go on expeditions of this
kind in the صيف, (S, Mgh, O, K,) and to return
in the winter, (Mgh,) on account of the cold and
snow. (S, O, K.) And they said, وَلِىَ فُلَانٌ
الصَّائِفَةَ, meaning Such a one was commander of
the army going on a warring, or warring and
plundering, expedition in the صَيْف: (Ham ubi
suprà:) [but Mtr says,] he who explains صَائِفَةٌ as
meaning the place [of], or the army [engaged in,
such an expedition], errs: [adding that the
Hanafee Imám] Mohammad has used the phrase
الصَّوَائِفُ وَنَحْوُهَا مِنَ العَسَاكِرِ العِظَامِ either by
surmise or by extension of the [proper] meaning.
(Mgh.) ―
