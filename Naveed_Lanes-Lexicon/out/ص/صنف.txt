صنف2
صنّفهُ, (M, K,) inf. n. تَصْنِيفٌ, (S, M, O, K,)
He assorted it; i. e. made it into, or disposed it
in, sorts, or species; (S, O, K;) and separated, or
distinguished, its several parts or portions or
constituents, one from another: (S, M, O, K:)
التَّصْنِيفُ is the separating, or distinguishing, of
things, one from another. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  And hence,
(Z, Msb, * TA,) تَصْنِيفُ الكُتُبِ (Z, TA) or الكِتَابِ:
(Msb:) you say, صنّف الكِتَابَ, inf. n. as above,
He composed the book. (MA.)
-A2-  صنّفت العِضَاهُ
The [trees called] عضاه became green: (M:) and
صنّف الشَّجَرُ the trees put forth their leaves: (O,
K: [and the like is said in the Msb:]) AHn says
that this signifies the trees began to leaf, so that
they were of two sorts, one sort that had leaved
and one sort that had not leaved; but this is not
a valid saying; and in like manner ↓ تصنّف:
(M:) accord. to the A, both signify the trees
became of different sorts; and in like manner
النَّبَاتُ [the plants, or herbage]: (TA:) and صنّف
الثَّمَرُ, inf. n. as above, signifies the fruits became
so that some of them were ripe exclusively of
others, and some of them coloured exclusively of
others: (Msb:) and الأَرْطَى ↓ تصنّف, and النَّبْتُ,
the [trees called] ارطى, and the plants, or herbage,
broke forth to leaf. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.) 'ObeydAlláh Ibn-Keys-er-Rukeiyát says,
سَقْيًا لِحُلْوَانَ ذِى الكُرُومِ وَمَا
صَنَّفَ مِنْ تِينِهِ وَمِنْ عِنَبِهْ
[May there be a sending down of rain to Hulwán, the possessor of vines, and of such as have
put forth their leaves, of the fig-trees and the
grape-vines thereof]: (O, K:) it is said in the K
that the verb in this verse is thus, from صنّف
الشَّجَرُ, not from صنّفهُ; and that J has erred in
the reading that he has given; for the reading
given by J, who ascribes this verse to Ibn-Ahmar, is صُنِّفَ; but this is the reading of
Fr, [as is said in the O,] and both readings are
correct; and of the latter, [accord. to which the
meaning is, and of such as have been made to
consist of various sorts or species, of the fig-trees
and the grape-vines thereof,] MF says, it is that
which the case requires, the commendation being
for the abundance and variety of the fruits of the
trees, rather than for the trees putting forth their
leaves. (TA.)

تصنّفت شَفَتُهُ His lip became chapped. (Ibn-
'Abbád, O, K.) And تصنّف سَاقُ النَّعَامَةِ The
shank of the ostrich became chapped. (TA.)
