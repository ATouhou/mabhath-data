is a custom of the Arabs to bind the صرار upon

صَرَارَةٌ: see the next paragraph, in three places.
صَرُورَةٌ (S, M, A, Msb, K) and ↓ صَارُورَةٌ (S, M,
Msb, K) and ↓ صَرُورٌ and ↓ صَارُورٌ (M, K) and
↓ صَرَارَةٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ صَرُورِىٌّ (S, M, Msb, K)
and ↓ صَارُورِىٌّ (M) or ↓ صَارُورَآءُ, (Sgh, K,) the last
like عَاشُورَآءُ, mentioned on the authority of Ks,
(TA,) A man who has not performed the pilgrimage to Mekkeh: (S, M, A, Msb, K:) so called
from صَرٌّ, signifying the “ act of confining, withholding, hindering, or preventing; ” (TA;) or
because the person so called refrains from expending of his property in pilgrimage: (Msb:) you
say also, اِمْرَأَةٌ صَرُورَةٌ a woman who has not performed the pilgrimage to Mekkeh: (S, Msb:)
pl. ↓ صَرَارٌ and ↓ صَرَارَةٌ: (K:) [or, rather, the
former is a coll. gen. n., of which صَرَارَةٌ is the n.
of un.; and the latter is a quasi-pl. n., like صَحَابَةٌ,
as well as n. un. of صَرَارٌ:] Fr cites, from certain
of the Arabs, ↓ صَرَارٌ as used collectively; and one
of the number is termed ↓ صَرَارَةٌ: (S:) each of the
forms ending with the relative ى receives the
dual and pl. and fem. inflections: and accord. to
IAar, the forms preceding those receive also the
dual and pl. inflections: (M, * TA:) and some say
that صَوَارِيرُ is pl. of ↓ صَارُورَةٌ: (TA:) or ↓ صَارُورَةٌ
and ↓ صَارُورٌ, (M,) or صَرُورَةٌ, (Lh, S, M, A, Msb,)
as occurring in the poetry of En-Nábighah,
(Yaakoob, S,) not used without ة, (Lh, M,) or all
the sing. forms above mentioned, (K,) signify one
who has not married: (M, A, K:) or who has not
had intercourse with women: as though he had
determined (أَصَرَّ) upon relinquishing them:
(Yaakoob, S, Msb: *) applied in like manner to a
woman, and to a plurality of persons: (M, K:)
the ة in صَرُورَةٌ applied to a man and to a woman
is not to denote the fem. gender, but to give the
utmost intensiveness to the signification. (IJ,
M.) ―
-b2-  It is said in a trad., لَا صَرُورَةَ فِى الإِسْلَامِ,
(S, M,) meaning, accord. to A 'Obeyd, There is
no abstinence from intercourse with women in
El-Islám: (M, TA:) i. e., no one should say, I
will not marry: (TA:) thus he makes صرورة a
noun signifying an accident: but it is better known
as an epithet: (M:) and IAth says that the meaning is, he who slays another in the حَرَم [or sacred
territory of Mekkeh] shall be slain: his saying,
“ I am a صرورة; I have not performed the pilgrimage, and I know not the sacredness of the
حَرَم; ” shall not be accepted of him: for in the
Time of Ignorance, the Kaabeh was a place of
refuge. (TA.)
دَرَاهِمُ صَرِيرَةٌ i. q. مَصْرُورَةٌ [i. e. Dirhems, or
pieces of money, tied up in a purse]: (K:) termed
in the present day ↓ صَرٌّ. (TA.)
-A2-  See also
صَارَّةٌ.
صَرَارِىٌّ A sailor: (S, M, K:) like صَارٍ: (S:)
pl. صَرَارِيُّونَ: (S, M, K:) it has no broken pl.:
(M:) or صَرّارِىّ should be [without tenween, imperfectly decl., and] mentioned in art. صرى; for
it is pl. of صُرَّآءٌ, which is pl. of صَارٍ, which J has
mentioned in art. صرى: AHát used to say that
صُرَّآءٌ is a sing., like حُسَّانٌ; but without sufficient
authority: and J has regarded صَرَارِىّ as a sing.
in consequence of his finding it to have the same
construction as a sing, in verses of Arabs;
whence he imagined the ى in it to be the relative
ى, as is shown by his mentioning the word in this
place. (IB.)
صَرُورِىٌّ: see صَرُورَةٌ.
صُرَّى: see صِرَّى:
-A2-  and see also art. صرى.
صُرِّى: see the next paragraph.
هِىَ مِنِّى صِرَّى, said of an oath, (S,) or هُوَ مِنِّى,
صِرَّى, (M, K,) and ↓ أَصِرَّى, and ↓ صِرِّى, and
↓ أَصِرِّى, (Yaakoob, S, M, K,) and ↓ صُرَّى and
↓ صُرِّى, (K, TA,) or ↓ صُرِّىٌّ and ↓ صِرِّىٌّ, (as in a
copy of the M,) It is a determination, or resolution,
from me; (S, M, K;) a serious assertion; not a
jest. (S, K.) Aboo-Semmál El-Asadee, his
she-camel having strayed, said, “I swear to
Thee, [O God,] that, if Thou restore her not
to me, I will not serve Thee: ” (S:) or, “O
God, if Thou restore her not to me, I will not
say a prayer to Thee: ” (TA:) and he found
her, her nose-rein having caught to a thorntree (عَوْسَجَة); and he took her, and said, عَلِمَ
رَبِّى أَنَّهَا مِنِّى صِرَّى My Lord knew that it was a
determination, or resolution, or serious assertion,
from me: (S:) or a confirmed determination:
(ISk:) it is derived from أَصْرَرْتُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ “ I
persevered, or persisted, in the thing: ” (S:) [or
“ I determined, or resolved, upon the thing: ”]
AHeyth says, ↓ صِرِّى, i. e., Determine thou, or
resolve thou; as though he addressed himself;
from أَصَرَّ عَلَى فِعْلِهِ “ he determined, or resolved,
upon going on in doing it, and not turning back: ”
it is also said that ↓ أَصِرّى is changed into ↓ أَصِرَّى,
like as they say بِأَبِى أَنْتَ and بِأَبَا أَنْتَ: and in
like manner, ↓ صِرِّى is changed into صِرَّى; the
ا in أَصِرِّى being elided: not that they are two
dial. vars., صَرَرْتُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ and أَصْرَرْتُ: and Fr.
says that صِرَّى and ↓ أَصِرَّى are originally imperatives; and that, when they desired to change
them [i. e. the imperatives] into nouns, they
changed the ى into | [written ى after fet-h]: and
in like manner, [changing verbs into nouns,] they
say, نُهِىَ عَنْ قِيلٍ وَقَالٍ; &c. (TA.) Accord. to
AZ, one says, ↓ إِنَّهَا مِنِّى لَأَصِرَّى meaning Verily,
it is a truth, or reality, from me; and Aboo-Málik says the same of ↓ أَصِرِّى. (TA.)
صِرِّى: see the next preceding paragraph, in
three places.
صَرِّىٌّ and ↓ صِرّىٌّ A dirhem, (S, M, A, K,)
and a deenár, (A,) that sounds, (S, M, K,) or
rings, (A,) when struck: (S, M, A, K; in some
copies of the last of which, in the place of إِذَا
نُقِرَ, is put اذا نُقِدَ: TA:) accord. to some, used
only in negative phrases: (IAar, M:) thus used
in the phrase, مَا لِفُلَانٍ صَرِّىٌّ, [expl. as] meaning
Such a one has not a dirhem nor a deenár:
(IAar, A: *) and so used, as meaning a dirhem,
by Khálid Ibn-Jembeh; who does not assign to
it a dual nor a pl. (TA.)

the صَرَّار in the present day]; (S, M, Mgh, L;)
a certain thing that creaks (يَصِرُّ); (Msb;) a
small flying thing; (K;) it is larger than the
جُنْدَب, and is called by some of the Arabs الصَّدَى:
(S, Mgh:) A 'Obeyd says that this last term
signifies a certain flying thing that creaks (يَصِرُّ)
by night, and hops, and flies, thought by the
[common] people to be the جُنْدَب, and found in
the deserts. (Msb.)
