صو2
صَوَّى صُوًى He made صُوًى [i. e. signs set
up for the guidance of travellers] in the way.
(TA. [The verb is originally صَوَّوَ: and صُوًى is
pl. of صُوَّةٌ.])
-A2-  [See also art. صوى.]

اصوى القَوْمُ The people, or party, alighted
in what are termed صُوًى, meaning elevated [or
rugged and elevated] tracts of land. (IKtt, TA.)
-A2-  [See also art. صوى.]
صَوٌّ i. q. فَارِغٌ, (K,) so in the Tekmileh, (TA,)
applied to a thing, meaning Empty, void, or
vacant. (TK.)
صَوَّةٌ: see what follows, near the end.
صُوَّةٌ A sign for the guidance of travellers, consisting of stones, (AA, S, IAth, Msb,) set up
(IAth, Msb) in the way (Msb) in an unknown
desert: (IAth:) or a stone that is a sign [for
guidance] in the way: (M, K:) or an elevated
sign of the way, set up in rugged ground: (M:)
pl. صُوًى (AA, S, M, IAth, Msb) and pl. pl.
أَصْوَآءٌ, (M, Msb, K,) the latter like أَرْطَابٌ pl. of
رُطَبٌ, (Msb, TA,) or, as some say, this is a pl.,
not a pl. pl. (TA.) It is said in a trad., إِنَّ
لِلْإِسْلَامِ صُوًى وَمَنَارًا كَمَنَارِ الطَّرِيقِ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily ElIslám has signs and marks of guidance like those
of the way]. (S.) ―
-b2-  Hence [the pl.] أًصْوَآءٌ is
applied to signify Graves: (S:) occurring in a
trad. in this sense. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And the sing., (S,
K,) accord. to As, (S,) signifies Rugged and
elevated ground, (S, K,) but inferior to a mountain: (S:) or an elevated and a rugged spot, upon
which, sometimes, stones are set up in order that
one may be directed thereby to the right way;
like ثُوَّةٌ. (M in art. ثو.) ―
-b4-  And A place of
varying, or of coming and going, (مُخْتَلَف) of
the wind: (S, K:) a poet says, (namely, Imra-el-
Keys, TA,)
وَهَبَّتْ لَهُ رِيحٌ بِمُخْتَلَفِ الصُّوَى
[meaning, if the explanation be correct, and the
citation appropriate, And a wind blew them
(referring to the word جَمْر, i. e. live coals, in a
verse immediately preceding) in the place of
varying of the places of varying of the wind]:
(S:) but Aboo-Zekereeyà, in the margin of his
book [or his copy of the S], throws doubt upon
the word meaning “ wind ” [in this explanation].
(TA. [See De Slane's “ Diwan d'Amro'lkais,”
p. 20 of the Arabic text and p. 34 of his translation.])
-A2-  Also An assemblage of beasts, or birds,
of prey: (M, K:) on the authority of Kr. (M.)
-A3-  And The sound of the echo: (K:) mentioned
by Az; but written by him with fet-h [i. e.
↓ صَوَّةٌ]. (TA.)
-A4-  أَخَذَهُ بِصُوَاهُ, expl. in the K as
meaning He took it in its fresh state (بِطَرَآءَتِهِ [in
the CK erroneously باَطْرافِه]), is a mistranscription; correctly, بِصَرَاهُ, with fet-h to the ص, and
with ر, as written by Az. (TA. [صَرًا and صَرَاوَةٌ,
both omitted in the K, are expl. in their proper
place in the TA as syn. with جِدَّةٌ and غَضَاضَةٌ.])
