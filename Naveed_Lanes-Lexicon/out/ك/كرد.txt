respecting their origin authors differ: it is said
that their ancestor was Kurd the son of 'Amr
Muzeykiyà the son of 'Ámir Má-es-Semà, not
'Ámir the son of Má-es-Semà, as in the K, for
Má-es-Semà was a surname of 'Ámir: (TA:)

Beewarásf, also called Ed-Dahhák, used to eat:
(IKt, MF, TA:) or their ancestor was Kurd
the son of Ken'án (or Canaan) the son of Koosh
(or Cush) the son of Hám (or Ham) the son of
Nooh (or Noah): they consist of countless tribes,
differing in language and condition, but all are
reduced to four principal tribes, the سوران and the
كوران and the كُلهر and the لُر: (Mohammad
Efendee El-Kurdee:) or their ancestor was Kurd
the son of 'Amr the son of 'Ámir the son of
Saasa'ah: (Abu-l-Yakdhán:) El-Mes'oodee says,
that some assert them to be of the descendants of
Rabee'ah the son of Nizár: others, that they are
of the descendants of Mudar the son of Nizár:
others, that they are descended from Kurd the
son of Ken'án the son of Koosh the son of Hám:
and he adds, that they are apparently of the
offspring of Hám, like the Persians: that among
the known tribes of which they consist are the
سورانيّة, the كورانية, the عمادية, the حكارية, the
محمودية, the بختية, the بشوية, the جوبية, the
زرزائية, the مهرانية, the جاودانية, the رضائية, the
سروجية, the هارونية, and the لرية: and that their
countries are Persia, and 'Irák el-'Ajam, and
Ádharbeeján, and Irbil, and El-Mósil. (Mo-
hammad Efendee El-Kurdee.) [Many other
assertions as to the origin of this people are
made by other authors.]
