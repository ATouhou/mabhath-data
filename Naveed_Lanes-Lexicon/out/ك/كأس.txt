كأسكَأْسٌ, (ISk, S, A, Msb, K,) and كَاسٌ,
with the ء suppressed, is allowable, (Msb,)
and sometimes occurs, (TA,) A drinking-cup:
(A, K:) or [a cup of wine; i. e.] a cup containing
wine; (S, A, K;) or a cup full of wine: (Msb:)
when not containing wine, it is not thus called;
(IAar, S, Msb;) being in this case called قَدَحٌ:
(TA:) or it has the first and the second of these
significations: (TA:) or it signifies wine itself:
(As, AHát, Ibn-'Abbád:) or has this signification also: (K:) and is of the fem. gender:
(S, A, Msb, K:) pl. [of pauc.] أَكْؤُسٌ and [of
mult.] كُؤُوسٌ and كِئَاسٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the last
with ء, (TA, [but written without ء in the CK,])
and, accord. to AHn, كِيَاسٌ, without ء, which,
if correct, is originally كِوَاسٌ, from كَاسٌ, with
the ء changed into ا as representing و, (TA,) and
كَاسَاتٌ, (K,) without ء. (TA.) It is used
metaphorically in relation to every kind of disagreeable, hateful, or evil, things. Thus you say,
سَقَاهُ كَأْسًا مِنَ الذُّلِّ (tropical:)  [He gave him to drink a
cup of abasement]: and مِنَ الفُرْقَةِ (tropical:)  [of separation]: and مِنَ المَوْتِ (tropical:)  [of death]: and مِنَ
الحُبِّ (tropical:)  [of love]. (TA.) You say also, سَقَاهُ
الكَأْسَ الأَمَرَّ (tropical:)  [He gave him to drink the most
bitter cup]; meaning death: (A, TA:) and
كُؤُوسَ المَنَايَا (tropical:)  [The cups of death; lit., deaths].
(A.) Az. thinks that it may be derived from
كَاصَ فُلَانٌ مِنَ الطَّعَامِ وَالشَّرَابِ, meaning, “ Such
a one ate and drank much ”; because ص and س
are interchangeable in many words on account
of the nearness of their places of utterance.
(TA.)
