كيت2
كيّت, inf. n. تَكْيِيتٌ, He stuffed, or filled,
a bag or other receptacle for travelling-provisions
or for goods or utensils &c. (En-Nawádir, TS,
K.) ―
-b2-  Also, He made his travelling-apparatus
light, or easy of conveyance; syn. يَسَّرَ. (S, K.)
A poet says,
كَيِّتْ جِهَازَكَ إِمَّا كُنْتَ مُرْتَحِلًا
إِنِّى أَخَافُ عَلَى أَذْوَادِكَ السَّبُعَا
[Make thy travelling apparatus light, when thou
art departing on a journey; for I fear for thy
droves, or troops, of camels, on account of the
beast of prey]. (S.)
أَكْيَاتٌ i. q. أَكْيَاسٌ, [pl. of كَيِّسٌ:] (K:) the
Rájiz says,
غَيْر أَعِفَّاءِ وَلَا أَكْيَاتِ
[Not such as abstain from things unlawful and
unbecoming, nor ingenious, or acute in mind, &c.].
(TA.) See art. س p. 1281 a. Some say, that it
it is a word mispronounced: others, that it is
formed by the change of س into ت, as in the
case of طَسٌّ and طَسْتٌ. (TA.)
كَانَ مِنَ الأَمْرِ كَيْتَ وَكَيْتَ, and كَيْت
وَكَيْتِ, (AO, S, K, &c.,) and كيْتُ وَكَيْتُ,
(IAth, ISd, IKtt,) i. e. كَذَا وَكَذَا, [Some of
the circumstances of the case were thus and thus;
or so and so; or such and such things]. (Lth,
K.) The ت in كيت is originally ة; (S, K:)
as in the case of ذَيْت; these two words being
originally كَيَّة and ذَيَّة: (TA:) or the ت in
كيت and ذيت is substituted for ى: they are
originally كَيَّة and ذَيَّة; and the ة is elided,
and the ى which is the last radical letter is
changed into ت: so accord. to AHei; and most
of the leading authorities on inflexion assert the
same. (MF. voce ذَيْتَ.) See ذيت.
