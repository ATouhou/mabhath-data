كلأ1
كَلَأَهُ, (S, K,) aor.
كَلَاَ, inf. n. كَلْءٌ (K) and
كِلَآءَةٌ (S, K) and كِلَآءٌ (K) [but respecting this
last see a verse of Jemeel cited below], He (i. e.
God, S) guarded him, or kept him, or kept him
safely. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  إِذْهَبُوا فِى كِلَآءَةِ اللّٰهِ Go ye
in the safe keeping of God. (S, TA.) ―
-b3-  In
the following verse of Jemeel,
فَكُونِى بِخَيْرٍ فِى كِلَآءِ وَغِبْطَةٍ
وَإِنْ كُنْتِ قَدْ أَزْمَعْتِ صَرْمِى وَبِغْضَتِى
[Then be thou in prosperity, in safe keeping (of
God), and in happy condition, even if thou have
firmly resolved to cut me and to detest me],
كِلَآءٌ may be an inf. n.; or it may be pl. of
كِلَأءَةٌ; or it may be put for كِلَآءَةٌ, the ة being
elided by a necessary poetical licence. (Abu-l-
Hasan.) ―
-b4-  The verb is also used without hemzeh, thus; كَلَاتُ, يَكْلُوكُمْ; and كَلَيْتُ, يَكْلَاكُمْ;
in the dial. of Kureysh; inf. n. كِلَايَةٌ: as the
pass. part. n. of both, مَكْلُوٌّ is more commonly
used than مَكْلِىٌّ, which is correctly used as the
pass. part. n. of كَلَيْتُ. (TA.) ―

(assumed tropical:)  He acted as a scout (رَبِيْئَة) for the party, or

of postponement or delay is involved: for he
who pays in advance for a thing grants a delay
in the delivery thereof.] IAar cites the following
verse:
فَمَنْ يُحْسِنْ إِلَيْهِمْ لَا يُكَلَِّئْ
إِلَى جَازٍ بِذَاكَ وَلَا كَرِيمِ
[So that he who does a good action to them does

life to its close. (K.) See 1.
5
تكلّأ; and ↓ كلّأ, inf. n. تَكْلِىْءٌ; He bought
on credit. [This is the explanation given in the
TK, and it appears to be correct. It is also
there said, that تَكَلَّأْتُهُ signifies أَخَذْتُهُ نَسْيْئَةً,
I took it, or bought it, on credit: and كَلَّأْتُ فِى
الطَّعَامِ, اخذته بالنّسيئةِ, I took, or bought, the
food on credit, but the latter I render differently. (See 2, above.) In the K we read الكَالِئُ
والكُلْأَةُ بِالضَّمِّ النَّسِيْئَةُ والعُرْبُونُ وتَكَلَّأْتُ وكَلَّأْتُ تَكْلِيْئًا
أخَذْتُهُ. IbrD thinks that the last word should
be أخَّرْتُ “ I postponed, or delayed ”: but I
rather think that it should be أَخَذْتُهَا, meaning
أَخَذْتُ نَسِيْئَةً I took, or bought, on credit. in the
TA we read, AO says, تَكَلَّأْتُ كُلْأَةً وكَلَّأْتُ
تَكْلِيْئًا إِسْتَنْسَأْتُ نَسِيْئَةَ أَىْ أَخَذْتُهُ وَالنَّسِيْئَةُ التَّأْخِيرُ
وَكَذٰلِكَ إِسْتَكْلَأْتُ كُلْأَةً: but the words اى
اخذته seem to have been added by SM; for
in the S we find, on the authority of AO,
تَكَلَّأْتُ أَىْ ا@سْسَنْسَأْتُ نَسِيْئَةً وَكَذٰلِكَ ا@سْتَكْلَأْتُ كُلْأَةً
بِالضَّمِّ وَهُوَ مِنَ التَّأْخِيرِ: whence it seems, that
تكلّأ, (or تكلّأ كُلْأَةً, and كُلْأَةً ↓ كلّأ, see above,)
and كُلأَةً ↓ الستكلأ, signify He asked for a delay
of the period of the payment of a debt.] See 8.
8
اكتلأ مِنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  He preserved, or guarded, himself from him or it; had a care of, or was
cautious of, him or it. (S, K. *) ―

-A2-  اكتلأ كُلْأَةً, and ↓ تكلّأها, He received a كُلْأَة

فَعَّالٌ; and therefore masc., and perfectly declinable: (S:) so called because it keeps the vessels
safe (يَكْلَؤُهَا) from the wind: but accord. to Th,
it is of the measure فَعْلَآءُ; and therefore fem.,

called because the wind there becomes slackened:
or a place where ships are moored, near the bank
of a river: (TA:) or a place sheltered from the
wind. (S.) ―

to be paid at a future time for a similar debt.
(S, TA.) [See the Jámi' es-Sagheer, and Mishkát el-Masábeeh, ii., 21.] What is forbidden
by this is, a man's buying a thing on credit for
a certain period, and, when the period of payment
is come, and he finds not that wherewith to pay
the debt, his saying, Sell it to me on credit for a
further period, for something additional: whereupon he [thus] sells it to him: (TK:) or, a
