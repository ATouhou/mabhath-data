وَأَكْسَدُوا كَسَدَتْ سُوقُهُمْ, which is the right
reading, as is indicated in the TA.]
كَسِيدٌ: see كَاسِدٌ. ―
-b2-  Also, of inferior condition; ignoble: syn. دُونٌ. (S, L, K.) So in
the saying of the poet, (S, L,) Mo'áwiyeh Ibn-Málik, surnamed Mo'owwidh-el-Hukamà, (IB,

إِذْ كُلُّ حَىٍّ نَابِتٌ بِأَرُومَةٍ
نَبْتَ العِضَاهِ فَمَاجِدٌ وَكَسِيدٌ
(S, L) meaning, Since every living man grows
from a root, like the growth of the 'idáh, there is
he who is noble, and he who is ignoble. (IB, L.)

respect to traffic; (L, Msb, K;) i. e., ذَاتُ كَسَادٍ.
