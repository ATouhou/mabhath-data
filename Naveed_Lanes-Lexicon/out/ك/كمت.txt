كُمْتَةٌ [A dark bay colour:] a red colour
mixed with blackness: (Kh, Sb:) or a red colour
mixed with قُنُوْء, (As, S, K,) which latter is
blackness that is not pure, or clear: (see كُمَيْتٌ:)
or a colour between black and red: (ISd:)
there are two kinds of كمتة; namely كُمْتَةُ
صُفْرَةٍ [yellow bay, or gilded bay,] and كُمْتَةُ حُمْرَةٍ
[red bay, or chestnut-bay]. (IAar.)
كُمَيْتٌ, masc. and fem., (S, K,) [A bay, or
dark bay, or brown, horse &c.:] of a red colour
mixed with blackness: (Kh, Sb:) or of a red
colour mixed with قُنُوْء, (As, S, K,) which latter
is blackness that is not pure, or clear:
(TA [app. from As]:) [see كُمْتَةٌ, above:]
a camel is called أَحْمَرُ if of an unmixed red;
but if of a red colour mixed with قنوء, it is
called كميت: (As, S:) the difference between
كميت and أَشْقَرُ, as applied to horses, is in the
mane and the tail: if these are red, the animal
is called اشقر [i. e. sorrel]; and if they are black,
it is called كميت; (AO, S, TA;) and the وَرْد
is between these two: (AO, TA:) [all bay horses
have black manes, which distinguish them from the
sorrel, that have red or white manes: (Farrier's
Dict., quoted in Johnson's Dict., voce “ bay ”:)]
an epithet applied to the horse and the camel
and other animals: (ISd:) you say فَرَسٌ كميتٌ,
and مُهْرَةٌ كميتٌ, and بَعِيرٌ كميتٌ, and نَاقَةٌ
كميتٌ: (TA:) accord. to the Kh, as cited by
Sb, it is of the dim. form because it denotes a
colour between black and red, as though to
imply that it signifies what is near to each of
these two colours. (S.) In a marginal note
in the S, it is said to be a foreign word arabicized.
(TA.) [Perhaps from the Persian كُمِيCَهْ:
Freytag says, accord. to some from the Persian
كُميته.] See also أَكْمَتُ, and كُمْتَةٌ. The
Arabs say, that the كميت is the most powerful
of horses, and the strongest in the hoofs. (TA.)
