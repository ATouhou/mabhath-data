[and if so must be written كَرَوْيًا]: (K:) or it
may be فَعَوْلًى: [but see what follows:] AHn
says that, if with medd, it is fem. [and therefore
كَرَوْيَآءُ]: but it is not Arabic [and therefore,
without medd, it is probably كَرَوْيَا]. (TA.)
كَرَوَانٌ

مُكَارٍ
One who lets beasts of carriage, &c., on
hire; like كَرِىٌّ, q. v.; an owner, and letter on
