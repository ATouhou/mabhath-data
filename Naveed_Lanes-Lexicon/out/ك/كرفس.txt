كرفسكَرَفْسٌ, (S, Msb, K,) so written in the Bári'
and the T, but in some copies of the S, كَرْفَسٌ,
[which is wrong,] (Msb,) [The herb smallage;
apium graveolens of Linnæus,] a well known
herb, or leguminous plant, (S, Msb, K,) of the
hottest of leguminous plants (منْ أَحَرِّ البُقُولِ, TA,
[but this is probably a mistake for مِنْ أَحْرَارِ البُقُولِ
of the leguminous plants that are eaten without
being cooked, or that are slender and succulent or
soft or sweet,]) the utilities of which are great;
diuretic; a disperser of winds and flatulence; a
cleanser of the kidneys and liver and bladder,
opening obstructions thereof; a strengthener of
the venereal faculty, especially its seeds pounded
with sugar and clarified butter, wonderful when
drunk three days, (K,) upon an empty stomach,
with avoidance of hurtful things, (TA,) but injurious to the young in the womb, and to the
pregnant, and to those affected with epilepsy:
(K:) said by Lth to be a foreign word
introduced into the Arabic language, (TA.) and
thought to be so by Az: (Msb:) in the O said
to be arabicized; and, in the language of the
people of Ghazneh, called كرفح [or كرفج?]
(TA.)
كُرْفُسٌ Cotton: (K:) [like كُرْسُفٌ, from which
it appears to be formed by transposition: see also
كِرْبَاسٌ.]
