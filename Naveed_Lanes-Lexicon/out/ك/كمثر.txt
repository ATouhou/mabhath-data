كمثرQ. 1
كَمْثَرَ, inf. n. كَمْثَرَةٌ, It became compact,
one part of it entering into another, or parts into
parts: (K: [but only the inf. n. is there
mentioned:]) an obsolete verb: (TA:) whence
the following word, (IDrd, K,) if it be Arabic.
(IDrd.)
كُمَّثْرًى (S, Msb, K,) a [coll.] gen. n., with
tenween, and, accord. to some, كُمَثْرًى, without
teshdeed, but others disallow this, (Msb,) A
certain kind of fruit; (T, S;) well known;
[namely, the pear;] called by [some of] the
vulgar إِجَّاصٌ: (T:) [it is called by this latter
name, and also إِنْجَاص and إِنْجَاس, in Syria;
but in Egypt and some other countries, كُمَّثْرَى:]
n. un. كُمَّثْرَاةٌ: (S, Msb, K:) pl. كُمَّثْرَيَاتٌ:
(K:) [here I find added in the TA, it is fem.,
imperfectly decl.; and in the K, “ and sometimes
it is masc. ”: but this is evidently wrong: it is
masc., and with tenween, as is shown by its
n. un.; but it is sometimes made fem., and then
it must be written كُمَّثْرَى, without tenween:
for it is added,] and one says, هٰذِهِ كُمَّثْرَى وَاحِدَةٌ
[this is one pear: in the copies of the K in my
possession erroneously written كُمَّثْرًى]: and
هٰذِهِ كُمَّثْرَى كَثِيرَةٌ [these are many pears]. (K.)
Its dim. has the following forms: كُمَيْمِثْرَةٌ, (K,)
which is the most agreeable with analogy, (ISd,
TA,) and كُمَيْمِثْرِيَةٌ, (K,) which is the form
adopted by those who make the pl. كمَّثْرَيَاتٌ,
(ISk, TA,) and كُمَيْثِرَةٌ, (K,) which is the best
form, (ISk, TA,) and كُمَيْمِثْرَاةٌ. (K.) Az
says, I have asked a number of Arabs of the
desert respecting the كمثرّى, but they knew it
not. (TA.)
