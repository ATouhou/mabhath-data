كفر1
كَفَرَ الشَّىْءَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, &c,) aor.,
in the sense first explained below
كَفِرَ, (S, K,
&c.;) [respecting which Fei observes,] ElFárábee, whom J follows, says that it is like
يَضْرِبُ, but in a trustworthy copy of the T it
is written
كَفُرَ, and this is the proper form, because
they say that كَفَرَ النِّعْمَةَ [of which the aor. is
كَفُرَ]
is borrowed from كَفَرَ الشَّىْءَ in the sense which is
first explained below; (Msb;) and MF says,
that the saying of J, following his maternal
uncle Aboo-Nasr El-Fárábee, that the aor. of
this verb is
كَفِرَ, is doubtless a mistake; but to
this, [says SM,] I reply, that it is correctly
كَفِرَ, as
J and F and other leading lexicologists have said;
though the aor. of the verb of كُفْرٌ as meaning
the contr. of إِيْمَانٌ is
كَفُرَ; (TA;) [or, if this latter
verb be taken from the former, the aor. of the
former may have been originally
كَفِرَ and
كَفُرَ, and
general usage may have afterwards applied the
aor.
كَفِرَ to one signification, while the aor.
كَفُرَ has
been applied by very few persons to that signification, but by all to the significations thence
derived;] inf. n. كَفْرٌ; (S, Msb;) and ↓ كفّرهُ,
(A, Mgh, K,) inf. n. تَكْفِيرٌ; (TA;) He veiled,
concealed, hid, or covered, the thing: (S, A, *
Mgh, * Msb, K: *) or he covered the thing so as to
destroy it: (Az, TA:) and كَفَرَ عَلَيْهِ, aor. [and
inf. n.] as above, he covered it; covered it over.
(K,) You say كَفَرَ البَذْرَ الْمَبْذُورَ CCC He covered
the sown seed with earth. (TA.) And كَفَرَ
السَّحَابُ السَّمَآءَ The clouds covered the sky. (A.)
Lebeed says,
فِى لَيْلَةٍ كَفَرَ النُّجُومَ غَمَامُهَا
In a night whereof the clouds that covered the
sky concealed the stars. (Msb.) You say also
كَفَرَهُ اللَّيْلُ, and كَفَرَ عَلَيْهِ, The night covered it
with its blackness. (TA.) And كَفَرَتِ الرِّيحُ
الرَّسْمَ The wind covered the trace or mark [with
dust.] (A.) And كَفَرَ فَوْقَ دِرْعِهِ He clad himself with a garment over his coat of mail. And
دِرْعَهُ بِثَوْبٍ ↓ كَفَّرَ He covered his coat of mail
with a garment. (TA.) And كَفَرَ مَتَاعَهُ He
put his goods in a receptacle. (TA.) And
كَفَرَ الْمَتَاعَ فِى الوِعَآءِ CCC He covered, or concealed,
the goods in the receptacle. (A.) And ↓ كَفَّرَ
نَفْسَهُ بِالسِّلَاحِ He covered himself with the arms.
(A.) And كَفَرَ الجَهْلُ عَلَى عِلْمِ فُلَانٍ Ignorance
covered over the knowledge of such a one. (TA.)
وَكَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ, [thus, with damm as the vowel
of the aor.,] in the Kur, iii. 96, has been explained as signifying And wherefore do ye cover
the familiarity and love in which ye were living?
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (Msb, TA,) كَفَرَ, (S,) and
كَفَرَ النِّعْمَةَ, and بِالنِّعْمَةِ; (Msb;) and كَفَرَ
نِعْمَةَ ا@للّٰهِ, and بِنِعْمَةِ ا@للّٰهِ; (K;) aor.
كَفُرَ, (TA,)
inf. n. كُفْرَانٌ. (S, K,) which is the most common
form in this case, (El-Basáïr,) and كُفُورٌ, (S,
K,) and كُفْرٌ; (El-Basáïr;) He covered, or
concealed, (Msb,) and denied, or disacknowledged,
the favour or benefit [conferred upon him]; (S,
Msb;) he was ungrateful, or unthankful, or
behaved ungratefully or unthankfully; contr. of
شَكَرَ; (S;) and he denied, or disacknowledged,
and concealed, or covered, the favour or benefit of
God: (K:) God's favours or benefits are the
signs which show to those who have discrimination that their Creator is one, without partner,
and that He has sent apostles with miraculous
signs and revealed scriptures and manifest
proofs. (Az, TA.) وَلَا نَكْفُرُكَ, in the prayer
[termed القُنُوتُ], means وَلَا نَكْفُرُ نِعْمَتَكَ [And we
will not deny, or disacknowledge, thy favour; or
we will not be ungrateful, or unthankful, for it].
(Msb.) [The verb when used in this sense,
seems, from what has been said above, to be a
حَقِيقَة عُرْفِيَّة, or word so much used in a particular tropical sense as to be, in that sense,
conventionally regarded as proper.] ―
-b3-  And
hence, كَفَرَ, inf. n. كُفْرَانٌ, is used to signify
[absolutely] He denied, or disacknowledged. (TA.)
[See the act. part. n., below: and see 3. See
also art. ف, p. 2322 a.] You say كَفَرَ بِالصَّانِعِ
He denied the Creator. (Msb.) ―
-b4-  Hence also,
(TA.) كَفَرَ, (S, Msb,) aor.
كَفُرَ, (Msb, TA,) inf. n.
كُفُرٌ, (S, Msb, K,) which is the most common
form in this case, (El-Basáïr,) and كَفْرٌ (K)
and كُفْرَانٌ (Msb, K) and كُفُورٌ, (K,) He disbelieved; he became an unbeliever, or infidel;
contr. of آمَنَ, inf. n. إِيْمَانٌ. (S, K.) You say
كَفَرَ بِا@للّٰهِ (S, Msb) He disbelieved in God: (S:)
because he who does so conceals, or covers, the
truth, and the favours of the liberal Dispenser of
favours [who is God]. (MF.) [Also, as shown
above, He denied God.] It is related in a
trad. of 'Abd-El-Melik, that he wrote to El-
Hajjáj, مَنْ أَقَرَّ بِالكُفْرِ فَخَلِّ سَبِيلَهُ, meaning,
Whosoever confesses the unbelief of him who
opposes the Benoo-Marwán, and goes forth
against them, let him go his way. (TA.) See
also كُفْرٌ, below. ―
-b5-  [He blasphemed: a signification very common in the present day.] ―
-b6-
Also, كَفَرَ بِكَذَا He declared himself to be clear,
or quit, of such a thing. (Msb.) In this sense
it is used in the Kur xiv. 27. (Msb, TA.) ―
-b7-
And كَفَرَ also signifies He was remiss, or fell
short of his duty, with respect to the law, and
neglected the gratitude or thankfulness to God
which was incumbent on him. So in the Kur
xxx. 43; as is shown by its being opposed to
عَمِلَ صَالِحًا. (TA.)
-A2-  كَفَرَ لَهُ, inf. n. كَفْرٌ:
see 2.
2
كفّرهُ, inf. n. تَكْفِيرٌ: see 1, first signification,
in three places.
-A2-  Hence, كَفَّرَ الذَّنْبَ It (war
in the cause of God [or the like]) covered, or
concealed, the crime or sin: (Mgh:) (or expiated it: or annulled it; for] تكفير with respect
to acts of disobedience is like إِحْبَاطٌ with respect
to reward. (S, K.) The saying in the Kur
[v. 70.] لَكَفَّرْنَا عَنْهُمْ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ means, We would
cover, or conceal, their sins, so that they should
become as though they had not been: or it may
mean, We would do away with their sins; as is
indicated by another saying in the Kur [xi. 116,]
“ good actions do away with sins. ” (El-Basáïr.)
كَفَّرَ ا@للّٰهُ عَنْهُ الذَّنْبَ signifies God effaced his
sin. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  And كَفَّرَ عَنْ يَمِينِهِ [He expiated his oath;] he performed, (Msb,) or gave,
(K,) what is termed كَفَّارَة [i. e. a fast, or alms,
for the expiation of his oath]: (Msb, K:)
تَكْفِيرٌ of an oath is the doing what is incumbent,
or obligatory, for the violation, or breaking,
thereof: (S:) كَفَّرَ يَمِينَهُ is a vulgar phrase.
(Mgh.)
-A3-  كَفَّرَهُ as syn. with أَكْفَرَهُ: see 4.
-A4-
كَفَّرَ لَهُ, inf. n. تَكْفِيرٌ, (A, Mgh, TA,) He did
obeisance to him, lowering his head, or bowing,
and bending himself, and putting his hand upon
his breast: (Mgh:) or put his hand upon his
breast and bent himself down to him: (TA:)
or he made a sign of humbling himself to him;
did obeisance to him: (A:) namely, an عِلْج
[or unbeliever of the Persians or other foreigners]
(A, Mgh) or a ذِمِّىّ [or free non- Muslim subject
of a Muslim government, i. e., a Christian, a Jew,
or a Sabian] (Mgh) to the king; (A, Mgh;) or
a slave to his master, or to his دِهْقَان [or chief]:
(TA:) and ↓ كَفَرَ, [aor.
كَفُرَ, accord. to the rule of
of the K,] (TK,) inf. n. كَفْرٌ, (K,) he (a Persian,
فَارِسِىٌّ, K, and so in the L and other lexicons,
but in the TS فَارِس, without ى, which is
probably a mistake of copyists, TA) paid honour
to his king, (K, TA,) by making a sing with his
head, near to prostration: (TA:) تَكْفِيرٌ is a
man's humbling himself to another, (S, K, TA,)
bending himself, and lowering his head, nearly in
the manner termed رُكُوعٌ; as one does when he
desires to pay honour to his friend; (TA;) or
as the عِلْج does to the دِهْقَان: (S:) and the
تكفير of the people of the scriptures [or Christians
and Jews, and Sabians] one's lowering his head
to his friend, like the تَسْلِيم with the Muslims:
or one's putting his hand, or his two hands, upon
his breast: (TA:) and تكفير in prayer is the
bending one's self much in the state of standing,
before the action termed رُكُوعٌ; the doing of
which was disapproved by Mohammad, accord.
to a trad. (TA.) It is said in a trad., إِذَا أَصْبَحَ
ا@بْنُ آدَمَ فَإِنَّ الأَعْضَآءَ تُكَفِّرُ كُلُّهَا لِلِّسَانِ When the
son of Adam rises in the morning, verily all the
members abase themselves to the tongue, (Mgh,
TA,) and confess obedience to it, and humbly
submit to its command. (TA.) ―
-b2-  تَكْفِيرٌ also
signifies The crowning a king with a crown,
[because] when he, or it, is seen, obeisance is
done to him (إِذَا رُئِىَ كُفِّرَ لَهُ). (K.) ―
-b3-  See also
تَكْفِيرٌ below.
3
كَافَرَنِى حَقِّى He denied, or disacknowledged,
to me my right, or just claim. (A, Mgh, K.)
Hence the saying of 'Ámir, إِذَا أَقَرَّ عِنْدَ القَاضِى
بِشَىْءٍ ثُمَّ كَافَرَ [When he confesses a thing in the
presence of the Kádee, then denies, or disacknowledges: كَافَرَ being thus used in the sense of
كَفَرَ]. But as to the saying of Mohammad
[the lawyer], رجُلٌ لَهُ عَلَى آخَرَ دَيْنٌ فَكَافَرَهُ بِهِ سِنِينَ
[A man who owed to another a debt, and denied
to him, in the case of it, for years], he seems to
have made it imply the meaning of المُمَاطَلَة,
and therefore to have made it trans. in the same
manner as المماطلة is trans. (Mgh.)
4
اكفرهُ, (S, A, Mgh, K,) and ↓ كفّرهُ, (A,
Mgh, Msb,) [the latter of which is the more
common in the present day,] He called him a
كَافِر [i. e. a disbeliever, an unbeliever, or an
infidel]: (S, Mgh, K:) he attributed, or imputed
to him, charged him with, or accused him of,
disbelief, or infidelity: (S, A, Msb:) or he said
to him كَفَرْتَ [Thou hast become an unbeliever,
or infidel, or Thou hast blasphemed: in this last
sense, “ he said to him Thou hast blasphemed, ”
كفّرهُ, to which alone it is assigned in the Msb,
is very commonly used in the present day].
(Msb.) Hence the saying, لَا تُكْفِرْ أَحَدًا مِنْ أَهْلِ
قِبْلَتِكَ Do not thou attribute or impute disbelief
or infidelity to any one of the people of thy
kibleh; (S, TA;) i. e., do not thou call any such
a disbeliever, &c.; or do not thou make him such
by thine assertion and thy saying. (TA.)
لَا تُكَفِّرُوا أَهْلَ قِبْلَتِكُمْ is not authorized by the
relation, though it be allowable as a dial. form.
(Mgh.) ―
-b2-  [Also] أَكْفَرْتُهُ, inf. n. إِكْفَارٌ, I made
him a disbeliever, an unbeliever, or an infidel;
I compelled him to become a disbeliever, &c.
(Msb.) And أَكْفَرَ فُلَانٌ صَاحِبَهُ Such a one
compelled his companion by evil treatment to
become disobedient after he had been obedient.
(Mgh.) And أَكْفَرَ الرَّجُلُ مُطِيعَهُ The man compelled him who had obeyed him to disobey him:
(T, TA:) or he made him to be under a necessity
to disobey him. (TA.)
-A2-  اكفر He (a man,
TA) kept, or confined himself, to the كَفْر, (K,)
i. e. قَرْيَة [town or village]; (TA;) as also ↓ اكتفر.
(IAar, K.)
5
تكفّر بِالسِّلَاحِ He covered himself with the
arms. And تكفّر بِالثَّوْبِ He enveloped himself
entirely with the garment. (A.)
8
إِكْتَفَرَ see 4, last signification.
كَفْرٌ The darkness and blackness of night;
[because it conceals things;] as also, sometimes,
↓ كِفْرٌ. (S, K.) [See also كَافِرٌ.] See a verse
cited voce ذُكَآءُ.
-A2-  Earth, or dust; because
it conceals what is beneath it. (Lh.)
-A3-  [Hence
also] A grave, or sepulchre: (S, K:) pl. كُفُورٌ.
(S.) Whence the saying, أَللّهُمَّ ا@غْفِرْ لِأَهْلِ الكُفُورِ
[O God, pardon the people of the graves]. (S.)
-A4-  [And hence, perhaps,] A town, or village;
[generally the latter;] syn. قَرْيَةٌ: (S, Mgh, Msb,
K:) a Syriac word, and mostly used by the
people of Syria [and of Egypt]: or, accord. to
El-Harbee, land that is far from men, by which
no one passes: (TA:) pl. كُفُورٌ: (S, Msb:)
in the present day, it is applied in Egypt to
any small قَرْيَة [or village] by the side of a great
قَرْيَة [or town]: they say القَرْيَةُ الفُلَانِيَّةُ وَكَفْرُهَا
[Such a town and its village]: and sometimes
one قَرْيَة has a number of كُفُور. (TA.) Hence
the saying of Mo'áwiyeh, أَهْلُ الكُفُورِ هُمْ أَهْلُ القُبُورِ
[The people of the villages are the people of the
graves]; meaning, that they are as the dead;
they do not see the great towns and the performance of the congregational prayers of Friday:
(S, Mgh:) by الكفور he meant the villages
(القُرَى) remote from the great towns and from
the places where the people of science assemble,
so that ignorance prevails among their inhabitants, and they are most quickly affected by
innovations in religion and by natural desires
which cause to err. (Az, TA.) Hence also
the trad. (of Aboo-Hureyreh, TA), لَيُخْرِجَنَّكُمُ
ا@لرُّومُ مِنْهَا كَفْرًا كَفْرًا [The Greeks will assuredly
expel you from them, town by town, or village by
village]; (S, * TA;) i. e. from the فُرًى of Syria.
(S, TA.) ―
-b2-  كَفْرٌ عَلَى كَفْرٍ also signifies One
upon another; or one part upon another. (TA.)
كُفْرٌ: see 1. [As a simple subst., Ingratitude,
&c. ―
-b2-  And particularly Denial, or disacknowledgment, of favours or benefits, and especially
of those conferred by God: and disbelief, unbelief; infidelity.] It is of four kinds: كُفْرُ إِنْكَارٍ
the denial, or disacknowledgment, of God, with
the heart and the tongue, having no knowledge of
what is told one of the unity of God [&c.]:
and كُفْرُ جُحُودٍ the acknowledgment with the
heart without confessing with the tongue: [or
the disacknowledgment of God with the tongue
while the heart acknowledges Him:] and كُفْرُ
المُعَانَدَةِ the knowledge of God with the heart,
and confession with the tongue, with refusal to
accept [the truth]: and كُفْرُ النِّفَاقِ the confession with the tongue with disbelief in the heart:
all of these are unpardonable: (L, TA:) the
greatest كُفْر is the denial, or disacknowledgment,
of the unity [of God], or of the prophetic office
[of Mohammad and others], or of the law of
God. (El-Basáïr.) [Also, Blasphemy. Its pl.,
as a simple subst. in all these senses, is said
to be كُفُورٌ.]. Akh says, that كُفُورًا [in the
accus. case] in the Kur xvii. 101, [to which may
be added v. 91 of the same ch., and xxv. 52,]
is pl. of كُفْرٌ, like as بُرُودٌ is pl. of بُرْدٌ. (S.)
-A2-
Tar, or pitch, syn. قِيرٌ; with which ships are
smeared; (K;) of which there are three sorts,
كُفْرٌ and قِيرٌ and زِفتٌ: كفر is melted, and
then ships are smeared with it: [whence, app.,
its name, from its being a covering:] زفت is
used for smearing skins for wine, &c. (ISh.)
كِفْرٌ: see كَفْرٌ.
كَفَرٌ: see كَافُورٌ.
كَفْرَةٌ: see كَافِرٌ.
كُفَرَّى, and its variations: see كَافُورٌ.
كَفُورٌ: see كافر.
كَفَّارٌ: see كافر.
كَفَّارَةٌ a subst. from تَكْفِيرُ اليَمِينِ, (S,) or an
intensive epithet in which the quality of a subst.
predominates; signifying [An expiation for a
sin or crime or a violated oath;] an action, or a
quality, which has the effect of effacing a wrong
action or sin or crime; (TA;) that which covers,
or conceals, sins or crimes; such as the كفّارة of
oaths [violated], and that of [the kind of divorce
termed] ظِهَار, and of unintentional homicide;
(T, TA;) an expiation (مَا كُفِّرَ بِهِ), such as an
alms-giving, and a fasting, and the like: (K:)
pl. كَفَّارَاتٌ. (T, TA.)
كَافِرٌ A sower: (S, K:) or a tiller of the
ground: (Msb:) because he covers over the seed
with earth: (S, Msb: *) pl. كُفَّارٌ. (S, TA.)
The pl. is said by some to be thus used in the
Kur lvii. 19. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Dark clouds, or a dark
cloud; (K;) because it conceals what is beneath
it. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Night: (K:) or intensely black
night; because it conceals everything by its
darkness. (S.) ―
-b4-  The darkness; (K;) because
it covers what is beneath it; (TA;) as also
↓ كَفْرَةٌ, accord. to the copies of the K; but in
the L, كَفْرٌ, q. v. (TA.) ―
-b5-  The sea; (S, A, K;)
for the same reason. (TA.) Thaalabeh Ibn-
So'eyr El-Mazinee says, (S, TA,) describing a
male and a female ostrich and their returning to
their eggs at sunset, (TA,)
فَتَذَكَّرَا ثَقَلًا رَثِيدًا بَعْدَمَا
أَلْقَتْ ذُكَآءُ يَمِينَهَا فِى كَافِرِ
[And they remembered goods placed side by side,
after the sun had cast its right side into a sea];
i. e., the sun had begun to set: or the poet may
mean [by كافر] night: (S, TA:) but Sgh says,
that the right reading is تَذَكَّرَتْ; the pronoun
referring to the female ostrich. (TA.) ―
-b6-  Also,
A great river: (S, K:) used in this sense by
El-Mutalemmis: (S:) and a great valley. (K.)
―
-b7-  [A man] staying, or abiding, [in a place,]
and hiding himself. (TA.) [See an ex. voce
عَرْشٌ.] ―
-b8-  [A man] wearing arms; covered with
arms: (Az, K:) as also ↓ مُكَفِّرٌ (A, K) and ↓ مُتَكَفِّرٌ
(S, A) and ↓ مُكَفَّرٌ: (A:) or this last signifies
bound fast in iron; (K, TA;) as though covered
and concealed by it: (TA:) pl. of the first,
كُفَّارٌ. (K.) Hence the following, (K,) said by
Mohammad during the pilgrimage of valediction,
(TA,) لَا تَرْجِعُوا بِعْدِى كُفَّارًا يَضْرِبُ بَعْضُكُمْ رِقَابَ
بَعْضٍ (K) [Do not ye become again, after me,
i. e., after my death,] wearers of arms, preparing yourselves for fight, [one party of you
smiting the necks of others;] as though he meant
thereby to forbid war: (AM, TA:) or [do not
ye become unbelievers, after me, &c.; i. e.,] do
not ye call people unbelievers, and so become
unbelievers [yourselves]. (AM, K, TA.) ―
-b9-  A
coat of mail; (Sgh, K;) because it conceals
what is beneath it. (TA.) ―
-b10-  One who has
covered his coat of mail with a garment worn
over it. (S.) ―
-b11-  كَافِرُ الدُّرُوعِ A garment that
is worn over the coat of mail. (A.)
-A2-  One
who denies, or disacknowledges, the favours or
benefits of God: (K:) [ungrateful; unthankful;
especially to God:] one who denies, or disacknowledges, the unity [of God], and the prophetic office [of Mohammad and others], and the
law of God, altogether, accord. to the common
conventional acceptation: a disbeliever; an unbeliever; an infidel; a miscreant; contr. of
مُؤْمِنٌ: (El- Basáïr:) because he conceals the
favours of God: (S:) or because his heart is
covered; as though it were of the measure
فَاعِلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: (IDrd,
TA:) or because كُفْر covers his heart altogether:
(Lth, TA:) i. e. having a covering to his heart:
or because, when God invites him to acknowledge
his unity, He invites him to accept his favours;
and when he refuses to do so, he covers the
favour of God, excluding it from him: (Az,
TA:) fem. with ة: (S, Msb, K:) pl. masc.
كَفَرَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the most common pl. of
كافر in the first of the senses explained above,
(El-Basáïr,) and كُفَّارٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the most
common pl. of the same in the last of those
senses, as contr. of مؤمن, (El-Basáïr,) and
كِفَارٌ (S, K) and كَافِرُونَ: (Msb:) and pl. fem.
كَوَافِرُ (S, Msb, K) and كَافِرَاتٌ: (Msb:) and
↓ رَجُلٌ كَفَّارٌ, and ↓ كَفُورٌ signify the same as كَافِرٌ:
(K:) or كَفُورٌ is an intensive epithet, meaning
very ungrateful, or unthankful, [&c., especially
to God]: so in the Kur xxii. 65, and xliii. 14:
and كَفَّارٌ has a more intensive signification than
كَفُورٌ, [meaning habitually ungrateful, &c.:] os
in the Kur ا 23: but sometimes it is used in
the sense of كَفُورٌ; as in the Kur xiv. 37: (ElBasáïr:) ↓ كَفُورٌ is fem. as well as masc.; (TA;)
and its pl. is كُفُرٌ, (K, * TA,) also both masc. and
fem.; and it has no unbroken pl. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Also, simply, Denying, or disacknowledging; a
denier, or disacknowledger: followed byبِ
before the thing denied: pl. كَافِرُونَ: (S, TA;)
so in the Kur ii. 38, (TA,) and xxviii. 48. (S,
TA.) ―
-b3-  [Also, Blaspheming; a blasphemer.]
-A3-  See also كَافُورٌ.
كَافُورٌ The spathe, or envelope of the طَلْع [or
spadix], (As, S, K, TA,) or upper covering
thereof, (TA,) of a palm-tree; (As, S, K, TA;)
the كِمّ of a palm-tree: (Mgh, Msb:) as also
↓ كُفَرَّى, (S, Mgh, Msb,) with damm to the ك
and fet-h to the ف and teshdeed to the ر, (Mgh,
Msb,) or كُفُرَّى, [so in the copies of the K, and
so I have found it written in other works, so
that both forms appear to be correct,] and
كَفَرَّى and كِفِرَّى, (K, * TA,) and ↓ كَافِرٌ (AHn,
K) and ↓ كَفَرٌ: (K:) so called because it conceals
what is within it: (Mgh, Msb:) or, accord. to
AA and Fr, the طَلْع [by which they probably
mean the spathe, for, as is said in the Mgh,
it is applied by some to the كِمّ (or spathe)
before it bursts open]: (S:) [↓ كفرّى is sometimes
masc., though more properly and commonly
fem.:] IAar says, I heard Umm-Rabáh say.
هٰذِهِ كفرّى and هٰذَا كفّرى: (TA:) the pl. of
كَافُورٌ is كَوَافِيرُ; and the pl. of كَافِرٌ is كَوَافِرُ.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  The زَمَع of the grape-vine;
(K, TA;) i. e., the leaves which cover what is
within them of the raceme; likened to the كافور
of the طلع; (TA;) the كِمّ [or calyx] of the
grapes, before the blossom comes forth; because
they cover the unopened raceme; accord. to IF,
as also ↓ كُفَرَّى: (Msb:) pl. كَوَافِيرُ and كَوَافِرُ,
accord. to the K; but it is well known that the
former is pl. of كافور, and the latter of كافر.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And, accord. to some, (assumed tropical:)  The envelope
[or calyx] of any plant. (TA.)
-A2-  [Camphor;]
a kind of perfume, (S, K,) well known, from
certain trees [the laurus camphora of Linn.] in
the mountains of the sea of India and China,
which afford shadow to many people or creatures,
(K,) by reason of its greatness and its many
spreading branches, (TA,) which leopards or
panthers frequent, and the wood of which is
white and easily broken; the كافور is found
within it, and is of various kinds, in colour red,
and becoming white only by تَصْعِيد [or sublimation]. (K.)
-A3-  Accord. to the M, A mixture of
perfume, composed of the spathe (كافور) of the
spadix of the palm-tree. (TA.)
-A4-  A certain
spring, or fountain, in paradise. (Fr. K.) So
in the Kur [lxxvi. 5,] إِنَّ ا@لْأَبْرَارَ يَشْرَبُونَ مِنْ
كَأْسٍ كَانَ مِزَاجُهَا كَافُورًا [Verily the pious shall
drink a cup of wine whereof the mixture is
Káfoor]. (Fr.) IDrd says, that it should be
imperfectly decl., because it is a fem. [proper]
name, determinate, of more than three letters;
but it is made perfectly decl. for the conformity
of the ends of the verses: Th says, that it is
made perfectly decl. because it is used by way of
comparison; and that if it were a [proper] name
of the spring, or fountain, it would be imperfectly decl.: Th means, says ISd, whereof the
mixture is like كافور [or camphor]: and Zj says,
that it may mean that the taste of perfume and
كافور is in it, or that it is mixed with كافور.
(TA.)
-A5-  A certain plant, (Lth, K,) [which I
believe to he the same as the camphorata Monspeliensis, see my “ Thousand and One Nights, ”
ch. xxviii. note 6,] of sweet odour, (ISd, K,)
the flower of which is (Lth, K) white, (Lth,)
like the flower of the أُقْحُوَان [or camomile].
(Lth, K.)
-A6-  IDrd says, I do not think the
كافور is Arabic, because they sometimes say
قَفُورٌ and قَافُورٌ. (TA.)
أَكْفَرُ [More, or most, ungrateful or unthank-
ful, especially to God; or disbelieving or unbelieving]. (TA.)
تَكْفِيرٌ, as a subst., The crown of a king.
(ISd, K.)
مُكْفَّرٌ A bird covered with feathers. (A.) See
also كَافِرٌ: and see مَكْفُورٌ.
-A2-  One who, though
beneficent, is regarded, or treated, with ingratitude; (K;) a benefactor whose beneficence
is not gratefully acknowledged. (A.)
مُكَفِّرٌ: see كَافِرٌ.
رَمَادٌ مَكْفُورٌ Ashes upon which the wind has
swept the dust so that it has covered them. (S.)
See also مُكَفَّرٌ.
