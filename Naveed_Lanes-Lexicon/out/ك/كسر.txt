النَّجَاشِىُّ, a name of the king of Abyssinia, (TA),

“ possessing ample dominion, ” (K,) in the Persian language: so they say: but خُسْرَوْ is itself
arabicized from خُوشْ رُوْ, which means, in that
language, “ goodly in countenance ”: (TA:)
[but that خسرو is an arabicized word may reasonably be doubted:] accord. to IDrst, it is changed
into كسرى because there is no word in Arabic
having the first letter with damm and ending
with و; and the خ is changed into ك to shew
that it is Arabicized: (MF:) the pl. is أَكَاسِرَةٌ,

of مَرِيضٌ, (S,) and كَسَارَى: (K:) [and مَكَاسِيرُ
is pl. of مَكْسُورٌ:] Abu-l-Hasan says, that Sb
mentions the pl. مَكَاسِيرُ because it is of a kind
proper to substs. (TA.) ―
-b2-  ناقة كَسِيرٌ (S, K)
i. q. مَكْسُورَةٌ [lit., A broken she-camel,] (K,) is like
the phrase كَفٌّ خَضِيبٌ, (S, TA,) meaning
مَخْضُوبَةٌ: (TA;) or a she-camel having one of
its legs broken: (Mgh:) and شَاةٌ كَسِيرٌ a sheep,
or goat, having one of its legs broken: كسير
being of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the
measure مَفْعُولٌ: (Mgh, Msb:) and كَسِيرَةٌ also,
[app. as an epithet in which the quality of a
subst. is predominant,] like نَطِيحَةٌ: (Msb:)
كَسِيرٌ, occurring in a trad. is explained as signifying a sheep, or goat, having a broken leg,
that cannot walk; (IAth, * Mgh;) but this
requires consideration. (Mgh.)

changed; (K;) the change being either apparent,
as in رِجَالٌ, pl. of رَجُلٌ, or understood, as in فُلْكٌ,
which is both sing. and pl., for the dammeh in
the sing. in this case is like the dammeh of
قُفْلٌ, and that in the pl. is like that of أسْدٌ. (Ibn-
'Akeel: see Dieterici's “ Alfijjah ” &c.; pp.
329 and 330.) ―

by the half of the دور: and it is sometimes called مِسَاحَةٌ. You say, مَا تَكْسِيرُ دَائِرَةٍ
قُطْرُهَا سَبْعَةٌ وَدَوْرُهَا ا@ثْنَانِ وَعِشْرُونَ [What is the
area of a circle of which the diameter is seven
and its circumference two-and-twenty?]: and the
answer is ثَمَانِيَةٌ وَثَلَاثُونَ وَنِصْفٌ [Eight-and-thirty

add that this is not perfectly exact.]
مَكْسِرٌ A place of breaking, (K, TA,) of anything. (TA.) You say, عُودٌ صُلْبُ المَكْسِرِ [Wood,
or a piece of wood, or a branch, or twig, hard
in the place of breaking,] when you know its
goodness by its breaking: (S, A:) and عُودٌ
طَيِّبُ المَكْسِرِ [Wood, &c., good in the place of
breaking,] i. e. approved. (K.) ―
-b2-  Hence, رَجُلٌ
صُلْبُ المَكْسِرِ (A, L) (tropical:)  A man who bears up
