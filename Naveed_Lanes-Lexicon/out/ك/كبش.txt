كَبَشَهُ, [aor.
كَبِشَ, accord. to present usage,]
inf. n. كَبْشٌ, He took it with his hand having the
fingers contracted; (TA;) [he took by the handful, so used in the present day.]
كَبْشٌ A ram, or male sheep, whatever be his
age: (M, TA:) or a male sheep [that has entered
his third year,] when he has cast his central
incisors: or when his tooth that is next to the
central pair of incisors has come forth: (Lth,
K:) [also applied in the present day to the wild
sheep of the Arabian and Egyptian deserts and
mountains; ovis tragelaphus:] pl. [of pauc.]
أَكْبُشٌ and أَكْبَاشٌ (K) and [of mult.] كِبَاشٌ
(S, A, K) [and app. كُبُوشٌ] and كُبُوشَةٌ, like
صُقُورَةٌ from صَقْرٌ. (TA.) The female is not
called كَبْشَةٌ, but نَعْجَةٌ. (IJ. [See رَاجِلَةٌ.]) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] (tropical:)  The chief, or lord, of a people, or
company of men; (S, K;) their leader: (K:)
or their strenuous defender, or protector, and the
one of them to whom others look. (TA.) You say,
هُوَ كَبْشُ الكَتِيبَةِ (A, TA) (tropical:)  He is the leader of
the army, or troop: (TA:) and هُمْ كِبَاشُ
الكَتَائِبِ (tropical:)  [They are the leaders of the armies,
or troops]. (A, TA.) And كِبَاشٌ also signifies
(tropical:)  Heroes, or brave men. (TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  Aged
and learned persons. (TA in art. خرف.) ―
-b3-
[Hence also, (tropical:)  A buttress: and a corbel which
juts out from a wall to support a superstructure:
so in the present day: pl. كُبُوشٌ.] You say,
بَنَوْا سُورًا حَصِينًا وَوَثَّقُوهُ بِالكُبُوشِ (tropical:)  [They built a
strong town-wall, and made it firm with the
buttresses]. (A, TA.) [See also another ex.
voce فَصِيلٌ.]
كَبْشَةٌ [A handful: a heap: so applied in the
the present day. ―
-b2-  And hence, (assumed tropical:)  A gang, or
crew: thus, also, applied in the present day.
Whence the sayings,] بَنُو فُلَانٍ كَبْشَةُ رُذَلَآءَ (assumed tropical:)  [The
sons of such a one are a gang of vile persons]: and
كَبْشَةُ دُنَسَآءَ (assumed tropical:)  [a gang of dirty, or filthy,
persons]: thus they use this word to intimate
dispraise: but [SM adds,] I know not how this
is. (TA.) [Perhaps SM means that he doubts
whether the word thus used be classical or not:
for as to its signification, it is well known.]
كَبَّاشٌ An owner, [or a tender] of كِبَاش [or
rams]. (TA.)
