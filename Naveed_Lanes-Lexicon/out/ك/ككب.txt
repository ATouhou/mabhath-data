Accord. to Lth, كوكب is a quadriliteral-radical
word; the و being a radical letter: it is also said to
be from وكب, or from كوب; though ك is not
one of the letters of augmentation; so that here it
must be augmentative contrary to rule. (TA.)
[But I rather think that it is an arabicized
word, from the Hebrew
כוֹכָב; and that ignorance
of its being so has caused the Arabs to dispute
respecting its formation.] ―
