كَثْءٌ A kind of أَقِط; what rises (from the

beneath it; or what becomes thick, or coagulated,
its oily matter floating upon the surface, (يَكْثَأُ,)
in the pot, and is poured out; the upper part
whereof is gross, or thick. So says AHát; and
he adds, What is termed مصرع [evidently, I
think, a mistranscription for مُضَرِّعٌ,] is what
becomes thick, or coagulated, and almost
thoroughly cooked: عاقد is that of which the
water has gone, and which is thoroughly cooked:
كَرِيص is that which is cooked with نَهْق or
حَمَصِيص: مَصْل is a kind of اقط cooked again:
and ثَوْر is a great piece of it. (TA.)
كَثْأَةٌ and كَثْأَةٌ (like كثعة, TA) Oily scum, or
floating curd, of milk; or what floats above the
water: (S, K, TA:) scum of a pot, after boiling.
