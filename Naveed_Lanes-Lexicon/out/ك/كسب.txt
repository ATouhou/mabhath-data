كسب1
كَسَبَ, aor.
كَسِبَ, inf. n. كَسْبٌ (S, K, Msb)
and كِسْبٌ (K), He collected (wealth &c.]; (S,
K;) as also ↓ اكتسبهُ. (S.) This is the original
signification. (S.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] He gained, acquired, or earned, wealth or the like; as also
↓ اكتسب. (Msb.) كَسَبْتُ شَيْئًا and ↓ اكْتَسَبْتُهُ are
syn., [signifying I gained a thing]. (S.) ―
-b3-
Hence [also], كَسَبَ and ↓ اكتسب (S, K, Msb)
and ↓ تكسّب (K) He sought, sought after, or
sought to gain, sustenance, or the like, (S, K,)
for his family: (Msb:) or كَسَبَ signifies he
got, or obtained, or gained, acquired, or earned,
[sustenance, &c.]; and ↓ اكتسب, he applied
himself with art and diligence [to get, or obtain,
or gain, acquire, or earn, sustenance &c.; he
laboured to earn, or gain, sustenance]: (Sb, K:)
[so] also ↓ تكسّب is explained by تَكَلَّفَ الكَسْبَ
he applied himself, as to a task, to gain, &c. (S.)
―
-b4-  كَسَبَ is also said to signify, and originally,
both he sought, or sought after, [sustenance]; and
he laboured in seeking, or seeking after, sustenance. (TA.) ―
-b5-  ↓ اكتسب has a more intensive signification than كَسَبَ; and hence, in
the last verse of the second chap. of the Kur
[لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَعَلَيْهَا مَا ا@كْتَسَبَتْ To it shall be
given what reward it hath earned, and upon it
shall be executed what punishment it hath drawn
upon itself], the latter is used with reference to
what is good; and the former, with reference to
what is evil. (IJ.) You say, كَسَبَ خَيْرًا (tropical:)  [He
gained, or earned, or did, good]: and ↓ اكتسب
شَرًّا (tropical:)  [He gained, or earned, or did, evil]. (A.)
―
-b6-  [This distinction, however, is not always
observed: for] كَسَبَ signifies, He did either a
good or an evil deed: [because he who does so
earns, or draws upon himself, reward or punishment.] (Jel in ii. 281; and iii. 24; &c.) And
↓ اكتسب He committed an act of which he was
accusable. (Jel in xxxiii. 58.) كَسَبَ إِثْمًا and
↓ اكتسبهُ signify He [committed, or] burdened
himself with (تَحَمَّلَ), a sin, or crime. (Msb.)
―
-b7-  كَسَبَهُ مَالًا, (S, K,) and مالا ↓ اكسبهُ, (IAar,
IAth, K,) but the former is the more approved:
the latter is by Fr and some others rejected:
(TA:) He caused him to gain, acquire, or earn,
wealth: (IAth, Msb:) or he assisted him to
gain, acquire, or earn, wealth. (IAth.) كسبهُ
عِلْمًا He caused him to gain, or acquire, knowledge. (Msb.) [In like manner,] العَبْدَ ↓ اسْتَكْسَبْتُ
I caused the slave to gain, or make gain; the
verb having here the sense of the measure أَفْعَلْتُهُ;
like as اِسْتَخْرَجْتُهُ signifies أَخْرَجْتُهُ. (Msb.) [See
an ex. voce أَدِيمٌ.] ―
-b8-  نَهَى عَنْ كَسْبِ الإِمَاءِ [He
(Mohammad) forbade the making female slaves
to earn money, or the like, (by prostitution)].
(TA, from a trad.) ―
-b9-  مَا كَسَبَ in the Kur
cxi, 2, is said to signify His children. A man's
children are among the things termed his كَسْب.
(TA.) ―
-b10-  كَسَبَهُ عَجَبًا It occasioned, or caused,
him to wonder. (TA, voce أَعْجَبَ.)

كَسْبٌ inf. n. of 1. q. v. ―

(S, K,) and ↓ المَكْسَبِ, and ↓ المَكْسِبِ, (K,) and

كُسْبٌ i. q. كُنجارق [or كَنْجَارَهُ], a Persian
word, called by some of the people of Es-Sawád
كُسْبَج [or كُسْبَه; i. e., The dregs of sesamegrain, or the like, from which the oil has been
expressed]; (TA;) dregs remaining after the
expression of oil: (S, K:) [as also كُزْبٌ:] from
the Persian كشب, (AM,) [or rather كُسْبَه, or
كُسْبَج]. See also تَخٌّ.

a name of the dog; i. e., of the male: (K:)
names thus used as ominous of gain, [or of
capturing game]: (IM:) كَسَابِ, as a name of
a hunting bitch, means كَاسِبَةٌ. (TA, art. برح.)
كَسُوبٌ [so in the copies of the K in my
hands; but by the place in which it is mentioned
in the TA, it is implied that it is ↓ كَسُّوبٌ: see
also لَسُوبٌ] A thing; anything. مَا لَهُ كَسُوبٌ
He has not anything. (K.)

الكَوَاسِبُ i. q. الجَوَارِحُ, (S, K,) here meaning
The members (either of a man or of a bird) by
means of which is gained, acquired, or earned,
sustenance, or the like. (MF.) [The explanation
in the TA, الجَوَارِحُ مِنَ الإِنْسَانِ وَالطَّيْرِ, seems,
at first sight, to signify preyers, whether men or
birds: but this meaning I do not think to be the
one intended.]
أَبُو كَاسِبٍ The wolf. (K.)
اِكْتِسَابِىٌّ [Acquired knowledge, such as is acquired by study: as also ↓ كَسْبِىٌّ:] opp. to
