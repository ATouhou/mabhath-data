تكامأنا فى أَرْضِهِمْ [We, together, gathered
the truffles called كَمْء in their land]. (A.)
كَمْءٌ A well-known vegetable, (K,) [the
truffle,] which comes forth from the earth like
the فُطْر: or what is called شَحْمُ الأَرْضِ [the
fat of the earth]; and the Arabs also call it
جُدَرِىُّ الأَرْضِ [the small-pox of the earth]: it
is also said that the name of كَمْأَةٌ is given to
those [truffles] that incline to dust-colour and
black; and جبأة (q. v.) to those that incline to
red: كُحْل and تُوتِيَا are compounded with the
juice of this vegetable [to apply to the eye]:
Th also mentions كَمَاةٌ [as used for كَمْأَةٌ].
(TA.) The dual of كَمْءٌ is كَمْآنِ; (S;) the
pl. (of pauc., S) أَكْمُؤٌ; (S, K;) and [pl. of
mult.] كَمْأَةٌ: (K:) this last is not a pl. of كمء,
but a quasi-pl. n.: (Sb, K:) [or كَمْأَةٌ is rather a
coll. gen. n. of which the n. un. is without the
ة, contr. to analogy: (see جَبْءٌ:)] in speaking
of many, you say كَمْأَةٌ, contr. to analogy:
(S:) or كَمْأَةٌ is the sing., and كَمْءٌ pl.: or
[accord. to some,] كَمْأَةٌ is both sing. and pl.:
(K:) AHn mentions كَمْأَةٌ as sing., and كَمْأَتَانِ
as dual, and كَمْآتٌ as pl.: but the right opinion
is that of Sb. (TA.) [كَمْأَةٌ also signifies Any
kind of fungus, such as the mushroom, and
toadstool. See فُطْرٌ.]
كَمَّاءٌ One who sells, and who gathers for sale,
[the truffles called] كَمْء. (K.)
مَكْمَأَةٌ and مَكْمُؤَةٌ A place in which [the truffles
called] كَمْء grow. (K.)
