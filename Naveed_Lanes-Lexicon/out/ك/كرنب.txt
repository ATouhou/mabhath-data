كرنبQ. 1
كرنب, inf. n. كَرْنَبَةٌ, He fed a guest
with كَرْنِيب. (K.) Ex. كَرْنِبُوا لِضَيْفِكُمْ فَإِنَّهُ
لَتَْحَانُ Feed your guest with كرنيب, for he is
hungry. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, He ate [كرنيب, or]
dates with milk. (K.) ―
-b3-  AHei and others assert
the ن to be augmentative; but in the T, L, and
K it is implied that it is radical. (MF.)
كُرْنُبٌ, with damm; [so in the copies of the
K in my hands, and in the O, and so accord. to
the TA; but I think that the correct reading is
كُرُنْبٌ, as the word is written by Golius, in one
place, and by Freytag; although, in the K, by
the words “ with damm, ” in the case of a quadriliteral word, is generally meant “ with damm
to the first and third letters ”;] and كَرَنْبٌ;
(K;) but it is commonly pronounced with damm
[app. meaning to the first and second letters:
كُرُنْب being the name now commonly given to
the brassica oleracea, or cabbage; in Greek
kra/mbh]: (TA:) the [vegetable also called] سِلْقٌ
[properly beet; for which, possibly, cabbage
may have been mistaken]: (AHn, K:) or a
species thereof, (L, K,) sweeter and more tender
than the قُنَّبِيط; of which the wild kind is bitter;
and the quantity of two drachms of its roots,
dried and pulverized, mixed with wine (شَرَاب),
is a tried antidote against the bite of a viper.
(Ibn-El-Beytár, K.) It is said, by the botanists,
to be a Nabathean word, arabicized. (MF.)
كَرْنِيبٌ and كِرْنِيبٌ (K) and كرناب (so in the
TA) i. q. مَجِيعَ, (K,) which is the same as كُدَيْرَاءُ:
(IAar:) Dates with milk. (T.)
