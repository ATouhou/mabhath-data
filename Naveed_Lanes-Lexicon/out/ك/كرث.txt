كرث1
كَرَثَهُ, aor.
كَرُثَ (and
كَرِثَ, TA, as from the K,
inf. n. كَرْثٌ; TA) and ↓ اكرثهُ; It (grief, S,
and an affair, TA) pressed severely upon him;
oppressed him; afflicted him; distressed him;
vexed him: (S, K, TA:) [as also قَرَثَهُ]. As
rejects the first form, although Ru-beh uses the
expression. [You say,] كَرَثَنِى الأَمْرُ The thing
grieved and oppressed me: (As, in TA [but see
above:] or pained me. (AA, Skr. p. 20.) ―
-b2-
كَرَثَهُ الأَمْرُ The affair moved him. (A)
4
أَكْرَثَ see 1.
7
انكرث It (a rope) broke. (K.)
8
اكترث He was oppressed, afflicted, distressed, or vexed. (Lth.) ―
-b2-  مَا أَكْتَرِثُ لَهُ (in
some copies of the S, بِهِ, which is more common,
MF) I care not for him, or it: (S, K:) or
I am not moved by, and do not care for, mind,
heed, or regard, him, or it: (A:) or, as some say,
I turn not my face towards him, or it: like
أَلْتَفِتُ. (TA.) The affirmative phrase أَكْتَرِثُ لَهُ
is a deviation from ordinary usage. (Nh.)
كَرَاثٌ [coll. gen. n.] A certain kind of large
trees, (K,) growing on the mountains. (AHn.)
[F mentions his having seen them on the mountains of Et-Táïf.]
-A2-  And see كُرَّاثٌ.
كَرِيثٌ: see كَارِثٌ. ―
-b2-  إِنَّهُ لَكَرِيثُ الأَمْرِ [Verily
he is in oppressive, afflicting, or distressing, circumstances; or timid, and retiring]: said when
one is timid, or cowardly, and draws back, or
desists [from an affair]. (K.) And فُلَانٌ
كَرِيثٌ عَنِ الأَمْرِ Such a one is a recoiler, or
shrinker, from the affair. (A in art. ربث.)
-A2-
كَرِيثٌ is also syn. with ↓ مَكْرُوثٌ [Oppressed,
afflicted, distressed, or vexed: and app. attended
with difficulty: see رَبِيثٌ] (T in art. ربث:) or
كَرِيثٌ and ↓ مَكْرُوثٌ both signify pained. (AA,
Skr, p. 20.)
بُسْرٌ كَريثَآءُ, and كَرَاثَآءُ, [in the copies of the
K, both words are written without tenween;
if rightly introduced here they would be with
tenween,] (like قَرِيثَآءُ and قَرَاثَآءُ, TA,) Good, or
sweet, dates, (K.) full-grown, and ripening.
(TA.) The leading lexicologists [except the
author of the K] agree in mentioning كريثاء
[only] in art. كرث; like قريثاء in قرث: and
the author of the K mentions both again in
chapter ث. Ibn-Esh-Sheybánee says, قريثاء and
كريثاء signify a kind of date (تَمْر): and some
say, a kind of full-grown, ripening date (بُسْر),
of a black colour, the skin of which quickly falls
off: accord. to the Fs, a well-known kind of
full-grown, green date; and said to be the best,
or sweetest, kind of date in the full-grown, green
state (TA.)
كَرَّاثٌ: see كُرَّاثٌ.
كُرَّاثٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ كَرَّاثٌ (Kr, K) and
↓ كَرَاثٌ (Aboo-'Alee El Kálee) [each a coll. gen.
n.,] A certain herb, or leguminous plant, (S, Msb,
K,) well-known, of foul odour, (Msb, TA,) and
of disagreeable juice; (TA;) [the common leek;
or allium porrum of Linn; or leeks:] كُرَّاثَةٌ is a
more particular term; (Msb;) [i. e. it is the
n. un. of كَرَّاثٌ, signifying a single leek.]
أَمْرٌ كَارِثٌ, and ↓ كَرِيثٌ, An affair that presses
severely upon one; that oppresses, afflicts, distresses, or vexes. (K.) ―
-b2-  كَرَثَتْهُ الكَوَارِثُ Affairs
pressed heavily upon him; or oppressed him. (A.)
الكُرْبُ الكَوَارِثُ [Oppressive sorrows, or anxieties.]
(S.) (See Har. p. 245)
مَكْرُوثٌ: see كَرِيثٌ.
