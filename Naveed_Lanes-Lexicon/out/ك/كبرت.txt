كبرتQ. 1
كَبْرَتَ بَعِيرَهُ He smeared his camel over
with كِبْرِيت [or sulphur], (K,) mixed with
grease, and with خَضَخَاض, which is a kind of
نِفْط [or naphtha], black, and of a thin consistence;
not قَطِرَان; for this is the black, thick, expressed
juice of a certain tree. (TS.) This is done to
cure the scab, for the removal of which it is
very efficacious. (TA.)
كِبْرِيتٌ [Brimstone, or sulphur;] a thing well
known; (S, art. كبر;) one of the kinds of stone
with which fire is kindled, or it (red كبريت TA)
is a mineral whereof the mine is beyond EtTubbat, [or the country of Et-Tibbet, in Tartary,] in the Valley of the Ants, (K,) by which
Solomon passed, (TA,) [as related in the Kur,
xxvii. 18]: or [the product of] a spring, or
source, whereof the water, when it congeals,
becomes white, and yellow, and dusky-coloured,
كبريت: (Lth, in the T:) MF says, I have
seen it in several places; among these, in one
which is near El-Maláleeh, between Fás and
Miknáseh; by swimming in which, persons are
cured of the venereal disease, and other disorders:
also in Africa Proper, in the midst of Barkah,
in a place called البرج; and in other places:
(TA:) Aristotle says, that, among the different
kinds of كبريت are the red, of an excellent
colour; and the white, which resembles dust; and
the yellow: the source of the red is in the West:
it does not appear in its place: the yellow is found
near the ocean, a league (or leagues, as in the
TA,) from it: it is useful in cases of epilepsy,
and apoplexy, and megrim, and palpitation:
and it enters into the preparations of gold: the
white blackens white substances; and it is sometimes mixed and concealed in the sources of
running water, which sources have a fetid odour:
the person who plunges into these waters in times
when the air is temperate is cured by them of
wounds, and swellings, and scab, and wind in the
womb, and [the leprosy called] سَلَع, that arises
from black bile: Ibn-Seenà [Avicenna] also says,
that كبريت, untouched by fire, is one of the
remedies for the leprosy (بَرَص): that, mixed with
the gum of the turpentine-tree, it removes marks
on the nails: that, mixed with vinegar, it removes
the [leprous-like discolouration of the skin called]
بَهَق, and the ringworm, or tetter, (قُوَبَاء,) especially
with the gum of the turpentine-tree: that, with
natron and water, it is an embrocation for the
بَرَص [or, as in the TA, for the نِقْرِس, or gout):
and that fumigation therewith stops a rheum:
and others say, that, if yellow كبريت be powdered, and sprinkled upon a place affected with
سلعة, it has a good effect: that fumigation
therewith whitens the hair: that serpents and
fleas flee from the scent of it, especially if [mixed]
with an unguent, or with the hoof of an ass; and
that the fumigation therewith beneath a citrontree of the kind called أُتْرُجّ causes all the fruits of
it to fall. (El-Kazweenee.) Several authors
say, that the ت in كبريت is an augmentative
letter, and that the proper place of the word is
in art. كبر. IDrd thinks it to be not genuine
Arabic. (TA.) [Golius thinks it to be from
the Persian كُوكُرْدْ (or كُوكُرْدْ): or rather, he
adds, from the Hebrew
נּפְּרִיח Gen. xix. 24.] ―
-b2-
أَعَزُّمِنَ الكِبْرِيتِ الأَحْمَرِ [More rare than red
brimstone, or sulphur]. A proverb. Some say,
that كبريت احمر [meaning as above] is a thing
that does not exist: others, that by it is meant
gold. (Meyd.) This phrase is similar to أَعَزُّ
مِنْ بَيْضِ الأَنُوقِ. (S, art. كبر.) ―
-b3-  كِبْرِيتٌ also
signifies gold: (K:) [see above:] or red gold:
or red [as an epithet applied to gold]: (TA:) or
pure, as an epithet applied to gold. (S, art.
كبر.) Ru-beh says,
هَلْ يَنْفَعَنِّى كَذِبٌ سِخْتِيتُ
أَوْ فِضَّةٌ أَوْ ذَهَبٌ كِبْرِيتُ
[Will vehement lying profit me, or silver, or
pure gold?] (S, art. كبر.) IAar says, Ru-beh
imagined that كبريت meant gold: upon which
MF observes, that the ancient Arabs erred with
respect to meanings, though not with respect to
words. The latter author, however, supposes
كبريت to be fig. used as signifying gold; for
they use the expression الكبريت الاحمر [as applied
to gold] because gold is [said to be] prepared
therefrom, and it is used in alchymical processes.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  كِبْرِيتٌ also signifies The red jacinth,
or ruby; syn. يَاقُوتٌ أَحْمَرُ. (K.)
