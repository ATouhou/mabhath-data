كر1
كَرڤ3َ [كَرَّ, i. e.] كَرَّ بِنَفْسِهِ, as distinguished from
the trans. كَرَّ, [aor.
كَرُ3َ,] (S, Mgh,) inf. n. كرٌّ,
(S,) or كُرُورٌ, (Mgh,) [or both,] He returned.
(S, Mgh.) You say كَرَّ عَلَيْهِ, (A, K,) aor,
كَرُ3َ,
(TA,) inf. n. كَرٌّ and كُرُورٌ and تَكْرَارٌ (A, K)
and كَرِيرٌ, (CK,) He turned to, or against, him,
or it: (A, K:) he returned to or against, it:
(TA:) the primary signification is the turning
to, or against, a thing, either in person, or in
act. (El-Basáïr.) And اِنْهَزَمَ ثُمَّ كَرَّ عَلَيْهِ [He
was put to flight: then he returned, or turned
back, against him]. (A.) And كَرَّ الفَارِسُ,
aor.
كَرُ3َ, inf. n. كَرٌّ, The horseman [wheeled round,
or about, or] fled, to wheel round, or about, and
then returned to the fight: (Msb:) [or returned
to the fight after wheeling round, or about, or
retiring, or being put to flight; as is implied in
the phrase next preceding, from the A, and in
many other examples: and simply, he charged,
or assaulted: opposed to فَرَّ: see كَرَّةٌ, below.]
You say also الجَوَادُ يَصْلُحُ لِلْكَرِّ وَا@لْفَرِّ [The courser
is suitable, or fit, for returning to the fight, or
for charging, or assaulting, and fleeing]. (Msb.)
[And كَرَّ signifies He, or it, returned time after
time.] You say أَفْنَاهُ كَرُّ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ The
returning of night and day time after time caused
him to come to an end. (Msb.) Also كَرَّ عَنْهُ
He returned from him, or it. (A, K.) And
عَنْ ذٰلِكَ ↓ تَكَرْكَرَ He returned from that. (TA.)
-A2-  كَرَّ is also trans., as well as intrans.; (S,)
TA;) كَرَّهُ, (aor.
كَرُ3َ, TA,) inf. n. كَرٌّ, signifying
He made, or caused, him, or it, to return: (S,
Mgh, TA:) and [in like manner,] عَنْ ↓ كَرْكَرَهُ
كَذَا, inf. n. كَرْكَرَةٌ, he made him to return, or
revert, from such a thing. (TA.) You say
كَرَّ عَلَيْهِ رُمْحَهُ, and فَرَسَهُ, inf. n. كَرٌّ, [He turned

TA,) He uttered a sound like that of one throttled,
or strangled: (S, K:) or like that of one harassed, or fatigued, or overburdened: (TA:)
or he rattled in his throat (حَشُرَجَ) in dying:
(AZ, S:) or he made a sound in his breast like
حَشْرَجَةٌ [or rattling in the throat in dying], (A,
TA) but not the same as this latter: and thus
do horses, in their breasts. (TA.) [See شَخَرَ.]
―
-b2-  Also, He (a sick man) gave up his spirit, at
death. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See also كَرِيرٌ, below.

كرّرهُ, inf. n. تَكْرِيرٌ (S, Msb, K) and تَكْرَارٌ,
(S, K,) or the latter is a simple subst., (Msb,)
or, as AA said to Aboo-Sa'eed Ed-Dareer, in
reply to a question respecting the difference
between the measures تَفْعَالٌ and تِفْعَالٌ, the
latter is a simple subst., and the former, with
fet-h, is an inf. n., (S, TA,) [but there are two
inf. ns. of the measure تِفْعَالٌ, both of unaugmented verbs, namely تِبْيَانٌ and تِلْقَآءٌ,] and تَكِرَّةٌ,
(Ibn-Buzurj, K,) [He repeated it, or reiterated
it, either once or more than once:] he repeated
it several times; reiterated it: (Msb:) or he
repeated it one time after another; (K;) which
may mean he tripled it, unless the “ other ” time
be not reckoned as a repetition; (TA;) as also
↓ كَرْكَرَهُ; (K; [in the CK, كَرْكَرَةً is put by
mistake for كَرْكَرَهُ;]) either by act or by speech:
(MF:) it differs from أَعَادَهُ, which signifies
only “ he repeated it once; ” for none but the
vulgar say أَعَادَهُ مَرَّاتٍ; whereas كَرَّرَهُ may
signify [not only the same as أَعَادَهُ, as it does in
many instances, but also] he repeated it time
after time: (Aboo-Hilál El-'Askeree:) some explain كَرَّرَهُ as signifying he mentioned it twice,
and he mentioned it one time after another:
(Sadr-ed-Deen Zádeh:) when it is used in the
former of these two senses, the term تَكْرَارٌ applies
to the second, and to the first [with respect to
the second]: ('Ináyeh, in the early part of
chap. ii.; and TA:) but its explanation as
signifying the mentioning a thing one time after
another is a conventional rendering of the
rhetoricians: (MF:) Es-Suyootee says, that
تَكْرَارٌ signifies the renewing the first word or
phrase; and it denotes a sort of تَأْكِيد [or corroboration]: but it is said to be a condition of
تأكيد that the words or phrases [which are
repeated] be without interruption, and occur not
more than three times; and that تكرار differs
from it in both these particulars; so that the
phrase in the Kur, [chap. lv.,] فَبِأَىِّ آلَآءِ رَبِّكُمَا
تُكَذِّبَانِ is an instance of تكرار, not of تأكيد,
because it occurs [with interruptions and] more
than three times; and so another phrase in the
Kur, [chap. lxxvii.,] وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِلْمُكَذِّبِينَ. (TA.)
You say كَرَّر عَلَى سَمْعِهِ كَذَا [He repeated, or
reiterated, such a thing, or saying, to his ear, or
ears, or hearing]. (A.)
5
تكرّر [It became repeated, or reiterated:
and it recurred]. You say تكرّر عَلَيْهِ [It (a
saying) became repeated, or reiterated, to him].

R. Q. 1
كَرْكَرَهُ: see 1: and 2.
R. Q. 2
تَكَرْكَرَ: see 1.
كَرٌّ A rope [made in the form of a hoop] by
means of which one ascends a palm-tree; (S, K;)
accord. to A'Obeyd, a name not applied to any
other rope; and so, says Az, I have heard from
the Arabs; it is made of the best of [the fibres
of the palm-tree called] لِيف: (TA:) or a thick
rope; (K;) accord. to AO, made of لِيف, and of
the outer covering (قِشْر) of the [portions of the
racemes of the palm-tree called] عَرَجِين and of
the [portion of the branch called] عَسِيب: (TA:)
or a rope, in general: (Th, K:) and the rope
[or sheet] of a sail: (S:) or the rope of a ship:
or the rope by which a ship is drawn: (TA:)
and a قَيْد [or pair of shackles, or hobbles,] made
of لِيف or of palm-leaves: (K:) pl. كُرُورٌ. (S,
TA.)
-A2-  The thing that connects the [two pieces
of wood called] ظَلِفَتَانِ of the [kind of camel's
saddle called] رَحْل, (S, K,) and that enters [or
is inserted] into them: (S:) [See شَجْرٌ and
شَخْرٌ:] or the skin, or leather, into which the
ظَلِفَات of the رَحْل enter; occupying the same
place in the رَحْل as the بِدَادَانِ have in the قَتَب,
excepting that the بدادان do not appear before
the ظَلِفَة: (TA:) pl. أَكْرَارٌ. (S, TA.)
كُرٌّ A certain measure of capacity, (Mgh,
Msb, K,) of the people of El-'Irák, (Mgh, K,)
for wheat; (S;) well known; (Msb;) consisting
of six ass-loads, (K,) that is, sixty times the
quantity called قَفِيز, (Az, Mgh, Msb, K,) accord.
to the people of El-'Irák, (TA,) the قفيز being
eight مَكَاكِيك, [in the TA, six, but this is a
mistake,] and the مَكُّوك being a صَاع and a half,
which is three كِيلَجَات; so that the كُرّ, accord.
to this reckoning, is twelve times the quantity
called وَسْق, (Az, Mgh, Msb,) each وسق being
sixty times the quantity called صاع: (Az, Mgh:)
in the Kitáb Kudámeh, it is said that the
كُرّ called المُعَدَّلُ is sixty times the quantity
called قفيز, and the قفيز is ten أَعْشِرَآء: and the
كُرّ called القَنْقَلُ is twice the quantity of the
كُرّ مُعَدَّل, that is, by the قفيز of the معدّل, a
hundred and twenty times the quantity of the
قفيز; with this كرّ are measured unripe dates
and dried dates and also olives, in the districts of
El-Basrah; and the قفيز used for measuring
dates is twenty-five times the رِطْل of Baghdád;
so that the كُرُّ القَنْقَلِ is three thousand times as
much as the رطل: and the كُرّ called الهَاشِمِىُّ is
the third part of the معدّل, that is, twenty times
as much as the قفيز, by the measure of the
معدّل; with this كُرّ, rice is measured: and the
كُرّ called الهَارُونِىُّ is equal to them two [but what
these two are is not shown]: and the أَهْوَازِىّ is
equal to them two: and the مَخْتُوم is sixth
part of the قفيز: and the قفيز is the tenth part
of the جَرِيب: (Mgh:) or the كُرّ is forty times
as much as the quantity called إِرْدَبّ; (K;) by
the reckoning of the people of Egypt, as ISd
says: (TA:) the pl. is إِكرَار. (S, Msb.) [It
is app. connected with the Hebrew
כֹּר, whence
the Greek ko/ros (a measure containing, accord.
to Josephus, six Attic medimni,) occurring
in Luke xvi. 7.]
كَرَّةٌ A return. (Msb.) So in the Kur,
[ii. 162,] لَوْ أَنَّ لَنَا كَرَّةً [Would that there were
for us] a return to the world, or former state.
And so in xxvi. 102, and xxxix. 59. (Jel.)
And so in the saying of Mohammad, اللّٰهَ اللّٰهَ
وَا@لْكَرَّةَ عَلَى نَبِيِّكُمْ Fear ye God, [fear ye God,]
and return to your prophet. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,
The return to life;] the resurrection; the renewal
of mankind, or of the creation, after perishing.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also, A return to the fight,
after wheeling away, or retiring: and simply,]
a charge, or an assault, (Mgh, K,) in war;
(TA;) as also ↓ كُرَّى: (Sgh, K:) pl. كَرَّاتٌ.
(K.) ―
-b4-  [Hence also,] A time; one time; [in
the sense of the French “ fois ”; generally
repeated, or used in the pl. form, so as to denote
a returning to an action, once, or more; i. e.,
repetition, or reiteration, thereof, agreeably with
the primary signification;] syn. مَرَّةٌ: (S, K:)
pl. as above. (S.) You say فَعَلَهُ كَرَّةً بَعْدَ كَرَّةٍ
[He did it time after time]. And فَعَلَهُ كَرَّاتٍ
[He did it several times]. (A.) ―
-b5-  [Hence also,]
A turn to prevail against an opposing party;
victory. So in the Kur, [xvii. 6,] ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَا لَكُمُ
الكَرَّةَ عَلَيْهِمْ [Then we gave to you the turn to
prevail against them; the victory over them].
(Bd, Jel.)
كُرَّى: see كَرَّةٌ.
كَرِيرٌ, an inf. n.: see 1. ―
-b2-  Also, A hoarseness
or roughness of the voice, occasioned by dust. (K.)
كَرَّارٌ: see مِكَرٌّ.
كِرْكِرَةٌ The callosity, or callous protuberance,
upon the breast of the camel, (رَحَى زَوْرِ البَعِيرِ,
S, K,) which, when the animal lies down, touches
[and rests] upon the ground, projecting from his
body, like a cake of bread; (TA;) it is one of
the five ثَفِنَات [of which there is one at each
knee and one at each stifle-joint]: (S, TA:) or
the breast of any animal of which the foot is of
the kind called خُفّ: (K:) pl. كَرَاكِرُ. (TA.)
حَزُّ الكَرَاكِرِ [lit. The incision of the كراكر] is
when a camel has a disease, so that he is not
even when he lies down upon his breast; in
consequence of which, a vein is gently drawn
forth from the كركرة, and then he [or it] is
cauterized. Hence the following, in a trad. of
Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr:
عَطَاؤُكُمُ لِلضَّارِبِينَ رِقَابَكُمْ
وَنُدْعَى إِذَا مَا كَانَ حَزُّ ا@لْكَرَاكِرِ
[Your bounty is for those who smite your necks,
and we are invited when there is a difficult undertaking to be accomplished, like the incision of
the كراكر:] meaning, ye invite us only when
ye are distressed, because of our skill in war;
and on occasions of bounty, and ampleness of the
means or circumstances of life, others. (IAth.)
مَكَرٌّ A place of war or fighting [where the combatants return time after time to the conflict,
wheeling away and then turning back]. (S)
مِكَرٌّ One who returns often [to the fight, after
wheeling away, or retiring, or being put to flight];
as also ↓ كَرَّارٌ. (K) ―
-b2-  فَرَسٌ مِكَرٌّ A horse that
is suitable, or fit, for returning to the fight, and
for charging, or assaulting. (S.) And فَرَسٌ
مِكَرٌّ مِفَرٌّ A horse well trained, willing, and active,
ready to return to the fight and to flee. (TA.)
―
-b3-  نَاقَةٌ مِكَرَّةٌ A she-camel that is milked twice
every day. (A, Sgh, K.)
مُكَرَّرٌ [Repeated; reiterated]. ―
-b2-  المُكَرَّرُ The
letter ر: (K:) because of the faltering of the
tip of the tongue which is observable when one
pauses after uttering it, occasioned by the reiteration with which that is done; wherefore,
with respect to إِمَالَة, [as an obstacle thereto,]
it is reckoned as two letters. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [مُكَرَّرٌ,
in the present day, also signifies Refined, as an
epithet applied to sugar, &c.]
