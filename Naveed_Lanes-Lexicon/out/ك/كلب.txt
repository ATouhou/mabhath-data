(TA,) or الكِرَابُ and الكِرَابَ; (Kh, S, art. كرب,
K;) of which readings, that of الكلاب is the
one generally adopted; (TA;) or they are two
distinct proverbs, each having its proper meaning;
(Meyd;) the former signifying, [if we read
الكِلَابَ,] Send the dogs against the wild oxen:
i. e., leave a man and his art: (S, K:) [but
accord. to MF, this is the meaning if we read
كراب; but if we read كلاب, the signification
is, as explained above, “ Send the dogs &c., ”
and the proverb is applied on the occasion of
instigating one set of people against another set,
without caring for what may happen to them:]
or it alludes to a man's having little care or
solicitude for the state, or case, or affair, of his
companion. (A 'Obeyd.) If we read الكلابُ,
the meaning is The dogs are upon, or against,
the wild oxen: and in like manner, if we read
الكرابُ, the meaning is “ The turning over of the
soil is the work of the oxen: ” if الكرابَ,
“ Leave the turning over of the soil to the oxen. ”

until he dies of thirst: the Arabs concur in the
assertion that its cure is a drop of the blood of
a king, mixed with water, and given to the
patient to drink. (TA.) Accord. to El-Mufaddal,
it originates from a disease which befalls the
standing corn &c., and which is not removed
until the sun rises upon it: if cattle eat of it
before that, they die: wherefore Mohammad
forbade pasturing by night: but sometimes a
camel runs away, and eats of such pasture before
sunrise, and dies in consequence: then a dog

some reject this explanation, and assert the
meaning to be, that, when a man is enraged [by
desire of obtaining revenge], and takes his blood
revenge, the blood is the cure of his rage,
though not really drunk. (TA.) See also

give to drink to the patient, and he becomes
cured. (Lh.) See also كَلَبٌ and كَلِبَ. ―
