-b2-  [You say]
هٰذَهِ إِبِلٌ مِائَةٌ أَوْ كَرْبُهَا (this is the right reading;

latter is the reading in the CK:]) There are a
hundred camels, or about that number; or
nearly so. (K.) كرب is syn. with قُرْبٌ. (L.)
-A2-  كَرْبٌ (S, O, K) and ↓ كُرْبَةٌ (S, O, Msb, K)
Grief [or distress, that affects the breath or respiration, [lit.] that takes away the breath: (S, O,
and so accord. to some copies of the K, [agreeably with present usage, see بَهْرٌ, last sentence:])
or the soul: (so [erroneously] accord. to some
copies of the K) or anxiety, solicitude, or disquietude of the mind: (Msb:) [or grief, or
anxiety, that presses heavily upon the heart:] or
both signify anxiety, grief, or intense grief:
(MA:) pl. of the former كُرُوبٌ, (K,) and of the
latter كُرَبٌ. (Msb.)
كُرْبٌ: see كَرْبٌ.
كَرَبٌ The rope that is tied to the bucket after
the مَنِين, which is the first [or main] rope, so
that it (the كرب) remains if the منين break: or
the rope that is tied to the middle of the cross-bars
of the bucket, (and is then doubled, and then
trebled, S,) so as to be that which is next the
water, in order that the great rope may not rot:
(S, K:) but in a marginal note in a copy of the
S, it is said that this latter explanation properly
applies to the دَرَك; not to the كرب: (IM:) pl.
أَكْرَابٌ. (TA.)
-A2-  كَرَبٌ [coll. gen. n.] The
lower parts, or ends, of palm-branches, (S, K,)
which are thick and broad, (K,) like shoulderblades: (S:) or the stumps of the branches, or
what remain upon the palm-tree, of the lower
parts, or ends, of the branches, after the lopping,
like steps: n. un. with ة. (TA.) Hence the
proverb,
مَتَى كَانَ حُكْمُ اللّٰهِ فِى كَرَبِ النَّخْلِ
[When was the wisdom of God in the stumps, or
lower ends, of palm-branches?] (S.) Said by
Jereer, in reply to Es-Salatán El-'Abdee, who
had pronounced El-Ferezdak superior to Jereer
in point of lineage, and Jereer superior to ElFerezdak as a poet. IB denies it to be a proverb; but IM contends against him that it is,
[The meaning is, When was God's wisdom in
husbandmen, and possessors of palm-trees? for
the region of Es-Salatán's tribe abounded in
palm-trees. The words are applied to a man
who provokes another to a contest for excellence,
being unworthy of the contest. See Freytag,
Arab. Prov., ii. 628.]
كُرْبَةٌ: see كَرْبٌ.
كَرَبَةٌ sing. of كِرَابٌ, which latter signifies The
channels in which water flows (S) in a valley:
(K:) or the upper parts (صُدُور) of valleys.
(AA.) Aboo-Dhu-eyb says, describing bees,
جَوَارِسُهَا تَأْوِى الشُّعُوفَ دَوَائِبًا
وَتَنْصَبُّ أَلْهَابًا مَصِيفًا كِرَابُهَا
[The eaters, or feeders, among them, resort to the
upper parts of the mountains, busily engaged, and
pour down (into) ravines with crooked water-channels]. (S.) [جوارس, شعوف, and مصيف,
are explained as above in the TA: and الهاب is
said in the S and TA, art. لهب, to be here pl. of
لِهْبٌ. In a copy of the S, this last is erroneously
written إِلْهَابًا.]
-A2-  كَرَبَةٌ (in the TA, written
كَرَبٌ,) The piece of wood (زِرّ) in which is inserted
the head of a tent-pole. (K.)
كَرْبَانُ A vessel nearly full: (S:) fem. كَرْبَاءُ;
pl. كَرْبَى and كِرَابٌ. (TA.) Yaakoob asserts,
that the ك in this word is a substitute for the ق
in قَرْبَانُ; but ISd denies this. (TA.)
كرابُ إِنَاءٍ [app. كِرَاب or كُرَاب] What is less
than جُمَامُ إِنَاوِ; [i. e., what is nearly equal to the
full, or piled-up, contents, or measure, of a vessel].
(TA.) See قِرَابٌ.
الكِرَابُ عَلَى البَقَرِ [The turning over of the soil is
the work of the oxen]: a proverb. (S, K.)
See art. كِلب: [where other readings, namely
الكِرَابَ and الكِلَابَ and الكِلَابُ, are mentioned].
(K.)
كَرِيبٌ i. q. قَرَاحٌ [Land which has neither
water nor trees: or land that is cleared for
sowing and planting: pl., app., كِرَابٌ: see an
ex. near the end of the first paragraph of art.
ختم:] (K:) and جَادِسٌ [land that is not
cultivated nor ploughed], that has never been
sowed. (TA.) See also جَرِيبٌ.
-A2-  A wooden
implement of a baker, or maker of bread, with
which he forms the cakes of bread (يُرَغِّفُ). (K.)
[In the TA is added “ in the oven ”: but I doubt
the propriety of this addition.]
-A3-  A knot, or
joint, (كَعْبٌ), of a reed or cane. (K.)
-A4-
Accord. to IAar, i. q. شُوبَقٌ, which is the same
as فَيْلَكُونٌ. [شوبق is an arabicised word, from
the Persian شُوبَجْ, or چُوبَهْ, both of which
signify a rolling-pin, and this meaning is given
to شوبق and شوبك in the present day. It should
be remarked, however, that كَرْنِيب (with ن),
which is probably a corruption of كَرِيبٌ, is a
name often given in Egypt, in the present day,
to a baker's peel.] In the L, كريب is explained,
as on the authority of Kr, by سَوِيقٌ; but this is
probably a mistake for شوبق. (TA.) See مَكْرُوبٌ.
كَرَابَةٌ: see كُرَابَةٌ
كُرَابَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ كَرَابَةٌ (K), but the former
is the more approved word, (TA,) Dates that
are picked from among the roots of the branches
(S, K) after the racemes of fruit have been cut
off: (S:) the scattered dates that remain at the
roots of the branches: (AHn, TA voce خُلَالَةٌ,
which signifies the same:) pl. أَكْرِبَةٌ, in the
formation of which, the augmentative letter
(meaning the fem. ة, TA,) seems to have been
rejected [or disregarded]; for فُعَالَةٌ (this is the
right reading; TA; but in some copies of the K
we read فُعَالَى, and in others فُعَال;) does not
form a pl. on the measure أَفْعِلَةٌ. (K.) ―
-b2-  AHn
says, that in this verse of Aboo-Dhu-eyb,
كَأَنَّمَا مَضْمَضَتْ مِن مَّاءِ أَكْرِبَةٍ
عَلَى سَيَابَةِ نَخلٍ دُونَهُ مَلَقُ
اكربة signifies Mountain-tops, from which the
water of the mountains flows down; and that its
pl. is كَرْبَةٌ: but ISd remarks, that this assertion
is not valid; because a sing. of such a measure
does not form a pl. on the measure أَفْعِلَةٌ. He
also says, in one place, that اكربة is [said to be]
pl. of كرابة, which signifies “ dates that fall
among the roots of the palm-branches; ” but
[that] this is a mistake: upon which ISd remarks, In like manner, [this] his saying is in
my opinion a mistake. (TA.)
كَرِيبَةٌ A misfortune; a calamity: (S:) or a
severe misfortune, or calamity: (K:) pl. كَرَائِبُ.
(S.)
الكَرُوبِيُّونَ (K) and الكَرُّوبِيُّونَ, or this latter is a
mistake, and الكَرُوبِيَّةُ, (TA,) [Hebr.
כְּרֻבִי�
Cherubim,] the chiefs, or princes, of the angels;
the archangels; (K;) of whom are Jebraeel and
Meekáeel and Isráfeel; who are also called
المُقَرَّبُونَ, accord. to Abu-l-'Áliyeh: (TA:) the
nearest of the angels to the bearers of the throne:
so called from كرب as signifying “ nearness ” or
the “ being near: ” (L:) or from their firmness,
or compactness, of make; [see مُكْرَبٌ] because of
their strength, and their patience in worship: or
from كَرَبٌ, “ sorrow &c., ” because of their fear
and awe of God. (MF.) Sh quotes the following of Umeiyeh:
كَرُوبِيَّةٌ مِنْهُمْ رُكُوعٌ وَسُجَّدٌ
[Archangels, among whom are (some) that bend
down the body, and (some) that prostrate
themselves]. (TA.)
مَا بِالدَّارِ كَرَّابٌ There is not any one in the
house. (S, K.)
كَارِبٌ [Becoming near; drawing near; approaching]: near; nigh. (TA.) ―
-b2-  'Abd-Keys
Ibn-Khufáf El-Burjumee says,
أَبُنَىَّ إِنَّ أَبَاكَ كَارِبُ يَوْمِهِ
فَإِذَا دُعِيتَ إِلَى المَكَارِمِ فَا@عْجَلِ
[O my child, verily thy father is near to his day
(of death): therefore when thou shalt be called to
(the performance of ) generous actions, make
haste]. (S.)
-A2-  أَمْرٌ كَارِبُ An afflicting, distressing, or oppressive, affair. (TA.)
مُكْرَبٌ (assumed tropical:)  A joint full of sinews (K.) ―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A

beast of carriage: (S:) a horse of strong and
firm make: (AA:) a firm, or compact, (or

-b4-  مُكْرَبُ
المَفَاصِلِ, (A,) and المفاصل ↓ مَكْرُوبُ, (Lth,)
(tropical:)  An animal of firm joints. (Lth, A.) ―
-b5-  مُكْرَبُ
الخَلْقِ (assumed tropical:)  Of firm make. (TA.)
-A2-  مُكْرَبَاتٌ
Camels that are brought to the doors of the tents,
or dwellings, in the season of severe cold, in order
that they may be warmed by the smoke: (K:)
[or] i. q. مُقْرَبَاتٌ: see مُقْرَبٌ. (TA.)
-A3-  دَلْوٌ مُكْرَبَةٌ
A bucket having a كَرَب attached to it. (S.)
