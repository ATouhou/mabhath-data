كيركِيرٌ [A blacksmith's bellows;] a blacksmith's
[skin, of the kind called] زِقّ, into which he blows:
(Mgh, K:) or a blacksmith's skin (زِقّ), with
which he blows [his fire]: (Msb:) also, (Msb,)
composed of a thick skin (جِلْد, S, Msb, or زِقّ,
S), with حَافَات [or edges, forming a wide mouth,
which being opened and closed by means of two
pieces of wood to which the edges are sewed, the
skin becomes filled with air, which is then forced
out through a pipe at the end opposite the mouth:
such, at least, is the most common kind of
bellows used by the Arabs of the present day
with which I am acquainted]: but the thing
constructed of clay [in which the blacksmith
kindles his fire] is called كُورٌ: (S, Msb:) so
ISk says he heard AA say: (Msb:) [but see
كُورٌ: and see a verse cited in the last paragraph
of art. عور:] the pl. [of pauc.] is أَكْيَارٌ, and
[of mult.] كِيَرَةٌ (Msb, K) and كِيرَانٌ; (K;)
the last on the authority of Th; but doubtful;
for it is not known in the lexicons, and is
[properly] pl. of كُورٌ. (TA.)
