كسج1
كسج, [app. كَسِجَ, aor.
كَسَجَ,] inf. n. كسج,
[app. كَسَجٌ,] He had no beard grown; [was
naturally beardless]. From this it would seem
that كوسج is an Arabic word. (IKoot, Msb.)
Q. Q. 1
كَوْسَجَ He was, or become, what is
termed كَوْسَجٌ; (K;) from which latter word
the verb is derived. (Shifa el-Ghaleel.)
Q. Q. 2
مَنْ طَانَتْ لِحْيَتُهُ تَكَوْسَجَ عَقْلُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [He
whose beard becometh long, his intellect becometh
small.] (TA.)
كَوْسَجٌ (Th, S, K, &c.) and كُوسَجٌ, (Fr, K,)
thus pronounced by some of the Arabs agreeably
with its Persian original, (Fr,) but this latter
form is disapproved by Yaakoob and ISk and
IDrst, (TA,) and AHei says that صُوبَجٌ and
سُوسَنٌ are the only words of the measure فُوعَلٌ,
(MF,) and كُوسُجٌ, (Ibn-Hishám El-Lakhmee,)
a more strange form than that immediately preceding, (MF,) a word of well-known meaning,
(K,) A man having no hair upon the side of his
face [but only upon his chin]; (M;) i. q. أَثَطُّ;
(M, S;) whose cheeks are clear of hair; (Expositions of the Fs) [used in the present day to
signify having a scanty, or small, beard, and that
only on the chin:] an arabicized word, (S, &c,)
originally كوسق, (Msb,) [or rather كُوسَهْ, which
is Persian]. ―
-b2-  Also, Deficient in the teeth:
(As, K:) from the Persian كوزه, (Sb,) [or
rather كُوسَهْ]: [pl. كَوَسِجُ, occurring in the
TA in art. ثط.] A woman said to her husband
Thou art كوسج: to which he replied, if I be
كوسج, thou art divorced. And the matter being
referred to the Imám Aboo-Haneefeh, he said,
Let his teeth be numbered; and if they be
twenty-eight, he is كوسج, and his wife is
divorced from him; but if they be thirty-two, he
is not so, and she is not divorced. And they
were numbered, and found to be thirty-two
(MF.) ―
-b3-  Also, [The Xiphias, or sword-fish;]
a certain fish (of the sea, S) that has a snout like
a saw, (S, K,) and eats men; i. q. لَخْمٌ, (TA,)
and جَمَلُ المَآءِ, (Mgh in art. جمل,) or جَمَلُ البَحْرِ.
(TA in that art.) ―
-b4-  Also, A slow hackney, or
nag. (A, K.)
