He used as the رَوِىّ two letters having their

to general usage in the present day:] or, accord.
to the Ahkám el-Asás, he changed the روىّ from

of one letter to another having its place of
utterance near to that of the former: or it has
another signification, given below, accord. to the
same authority: (TA:) or he used different
letters in the rhymes; (S, K;) whether letters

other, or the contrary; (TA;) or in some م and

and this is the meaning known to the Arabs:
(S:) or he used different vowels in the روىّ:
(Fr, S:) or i. q. أَقْوَى: (S, K:) or, accord. to
the Ahkám el-Asás, it signifies either as explained above on that authority, (TA,) or he used
different final inflections in the rhymes: (K:)

كَسْرَة, [which are the two vowels that resemble
each other]: (TA:) [see a verse cited in the
