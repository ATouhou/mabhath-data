a horse; (S;) and the cover from a thing; (S;)
and the skin from a slaughtered camel: (TA:)
and قَشَطَ is a dial. var. thereof; (Yaakoob, S;)
the former being of the dial. of Kureysh,
(Yaakoob, accord. to the TA,) or of Keys, (M
in art. قشط,) and the latter of the dial. of Temeem
and Asad; the ك not being a substitute for the
ق: (Yaakoob, TA:) and ↓ استكشط signifies the
same. (Ham., p. 693.) It is said in the Kur,
[lxxxi. 11,] وَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ كُشِطَتْ And when the
heaven shall be removed from its place, like as a
roof is removed from its place; (Zj, K;) and in
like manner قُشِطَتٌ, (Zj, S, *) accord. to the
reading of 'Abd-Allah [Ibn-Mes'ood]: (S:) or
shall be pulled off and folded together. (Fr.)
And you say also, كَشَطَ الحَرْفَ He removed the
letter from its place. (TA.) And كُشِطَ رَوْعُهُ,
(TA,) inf. n. كِشَاطٌ, (K, * TA,) (tropical:)  His fright, or
fear, became removed; (K, * TA;) and so ↓ انكشط

or fear, went away. (S, K, TA.) And كَشَطَ
الدَّابَّهَ and قَشَطَهَا [He removed the housing, or

as above, (Msb,) and so the inf. n., (S, Msb,)
I skinned the camel: (S, Msb:) you should not
say سَلَخْتُ; for the Arabs, in speaking of a
camel, say only كَشَطْتُهُ and جَلَّدْتُهُ. (S.)
