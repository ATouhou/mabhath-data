word [from the Persian كُوسٌ, pronounced
“ kós, ” but in Arabic “ koos, ” and applied in
the present day to a kettle-drum; accord. to
Golius, a kettle-drum that used to be beaten in
the camps and palaces of kings]. (S, K.) [The
modern pl. is كُوسَات.]
-A2-  Hence, A فَرْسَخ [or
parasang, or league, in which sense also it is of
Persian origin]: because this is the utmost
distance at which may be heard the beating of
the كوس. (TA.)

of wood with which a carpenter measures the
