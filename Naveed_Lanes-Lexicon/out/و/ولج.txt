ولج1
وَلَجَ, aor. يَلِجُ, inf. n. وُلُوجٌ and لِجَةٌ; and
↓ إِتَّلَجَ; (S, K;) and ↓ تولّج; (L;) He, or it,
entered. (S, K.) You say وَلَجَ البَيْتَ, and
↓ اتّلجه, and ↓ تولّجهُ, He entered the house.
(L.) And وَلَجَ الشَّىْءُ فِى غَيرِهِ The thing entered
into another thing. (Msb.) As is said in the S
and L, Sb says that وَلَجَ has for its inf. n. وُلُوجٌ,
which is of one of the measures of the inf.
ns. of intrans. verbs, because the meaning [of
وَلَجْتُ البَيْتَ] is وَلَجْتُ فِيهِ: and it is said in
the M, that Sb holds the intermediate particle to
be dropped: but Mohammad Ibn-Yezeed holds
the verb to be trans. without an intermediate
particle. MF observes, that Sb's words appear
to make ولج a trans. verb, which no one asserts
it to be: that if he mean that it has as its
complement a noun in the acc. case as an adverbial noun of place, it is like دَخَلْتُ and
other intrans. verbs: but if he mean that it
governs a simple objective complement, like
ضَرَبْتُ زَيْدًا, his opinion is not correct. (TA.)

and it is applied to one and to more than one:
(TA:) or one whom a person takes to rely upon,

antelope, TA,) among trees, (S, K,) into which
he enters (الَّذِى يَلِج فِيهِ); like دَوْلَجٌ: the ت,
