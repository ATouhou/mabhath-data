motion of his penis in its prepuce. (TA.) ―
-b7-
وَقَبَ, aor. يَقِبُ, inf. n. وَقْبٌ It (a thing) entered:
(S:) but it is said in a marginal note in a copy
of the S, that the inf. n. is correctly وُقُوبٌ, because
the verb is intrans.: accord. to some, it signifies
he, or it, entered into a وَقْبٌ, q. v.; and in the

this sense. (TA.) [In the CK, وَقْت is put by

is imputed: but the former is evidently the
