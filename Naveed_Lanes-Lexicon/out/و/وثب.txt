وَثَبَ, aor. يَثِبُ, inf. n. وَثْبٌ and وُثُوبٌ (the
latter agreeable with analogy, TA,) and وَثَبَانٌ
and وَثِيبٌ (S, K) and وِثاَبٌ (K; but this is
generally affirmed to be an inf. n. of وَاثَبَ, TA;)
and ثِبَةٌ, (Ibn-Málik and others) He leaped;
jumped; sprang; bounded: (S, K:) or he leaped

The act of rising, or standing up. (TA.) ―
-b6-  It
is also much used by the vulgar as signifying
The act of hastening to a thing; as observed by
MF, who is wrong in saying that there is nothing
in the lexicons that favours its being so used.
(TA.)
-A2-  وَثَبَ, [aor. يَثِبُ,] inf. n. وَثْبٌ, in the
dial. of Himyer signifies He sat; sat down.
(K, TA, from a trad.) ثِبْ in that dial. signifies
Sit; sit down. (S.) It is related that Zeyd
Ibn-Abd-Allah Ibn-Dárim came as an envoy to
one of the kings of Himyer, and found him at a
hunting-place belonging to him, on a high
mountain, and he saluted him, and mentioned to
him his lineage, or relationship; whereupon the
king said to him ثِبْ, meaning إِجْلِسْ, Sit; but
the man thought that he commanded him to leap
from the mountain; and he said, “Thou shalt
find me, O king, very obedient: ” then he leaped
from the mountain, and perished. So the king
said, “What ailed him? ” And they explained
to him his case, and his mistake respecting the
word: upon which he said لَيْسَتْ عِنْدَنَا عَرَبِيَّتْ مَنْ
دَخَلَ ظَفَارِ حَمَّرَ i. e., [“ Arabic is not current with
us: ” (for, probably, in the time of this king, the
term عَرَبِيَّة was only applied to the general language of Arabia:) “ whoso entereth Dhafári,]
let him learn [or, rather, speak, as MF says,]
the Himyeree language. ” (Mz., 16th نوع.) [The
principal facts of this anecdote are also mentioned
in the S, on the authority of As.] By the king's
saying عَرَبِيَّتْ was meant العَرَبِيَّةُ: the ة is pronounced ت in the case of a pause (which is the
case here) in their dialect. (S.) Or, accord. to
another relation of the above anecdote, the king
said لَيْسَ عِنْدَنَا عَرَبِيَّتْ كَعَرَبِيَّتْكُمْ [“ Arabic like
your Arabic is not current with us: ”] and this,
says ISd, is the right reading in my opinion:
for the king did not mean to exclude himself
from the Arabs. (MF.)
