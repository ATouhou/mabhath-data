وضنوَضِينٌ
A girth (بِطَان) wide, woven of thongs
or hair, or only of skin; (M, K;) said to be
adapted for the
رَحْل
and the
هَوْدَج; the بِطَان
being peculiarly for the قَتَب: (M:) or it is for
the
هَوْدَج, like the
بِطَان
for the
قَتَب
and the
تَصْدِير
for the
رَحْل
and the
حِزَام
for the
سَرْج;
and both [but to what this refers is doubtful]
are like the
نِسْع, except that they are of thongs
woven one upon another, doubly or more. (S.)
