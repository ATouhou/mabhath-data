استورأتِ الإِبِلُ The camels took fright and
ran away, in a body, one after another: (As:)
accord. to AZ, this is said when they have taken
fright and ascended a mountain; but if they
have taken fright and run away in a plain, one
says استأورت: so in the dial. of the tribe of
'Okeyl. [Thus in the TA in this art.: but see
إِسْتَؤَرتْ.]
وَرَآءَ and وَرَآءُ and وَرَآءِ, indecl., (K,) an adverbial
noun of place or time: (Bd, &c.:) J mentions
it in art. ورى, regarding the
وَرُاَ as substituted for
ى; and this is the opinion of the Koofees, and
of all writers on inflexion, though disapproved
by F, who, however, mentions it again in art.
ورى as though belonging to that art.: (TA:)
Behind: and, contr., before. (K.) In like
manner, الوَرَآءُ [The location that is behind, or
beyond; and the time past: and, contr. that is
before, or preceding]. (K.) Or it does not bear
contr. meanings; but one meaning; namely,
what is concealed from one. (K, art. ورى.) Or
it is a homonym; [but not a word of contr.
meanings; as it signifies what is behind, or beyond, in respect of place, and what is before in
respect of time]. Fr. says, It is not allowable to
say, of a man behind thee, that he is بَيْنَ يَدَيْكَ;
nor of a man before thee, that he is وَرَآءَك; these
expressions being only allowable [as synonymous]
in cases relating to particular times of events or
actions: thus one may say, وَرَآءَكَ بَرْدٌ شَدِيدٌ and
بَيْنَ يَدَيْكَ برد شديد [meaning Before thee is
intense cold]: each of these expressions is allowable because the intense cold is a thing that is
coming; so, as it will overtake thee, it is, as
it were, behind thee; and as thou wilt attain
to the period thereof, it is, as it were, before
thee. It is said in the Kur, [xviii. 78,] كَانَ
وَرَآءَهُمْ مَلِكٌ There was before them a king:
[because it has reference to a certain period,
which might be said to be before them as they
would attain to it, and behind them as it would
overtake them: this passage Jelál-ed-Deen explains by saying, “there was behind them when
they returned, and before them now, a king. ”]
Of the same kind also is the phrase مِن وَرَائِهِ جَهَنَّمُ
[Kur, xiv. 19,] Before him is hell: [for the same
reason]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  وَيَكْفُرُونَ بِما وَرَآءَهُ, [Kur,
ii. 85,] signifies And they disbelieve in what
[hath been revealed] beside that: syn. سِوَاهُ:
(IAar:) or it may mean after that. (Jel.)
―
-b3-  وراء is masc. and fem. (TA.) Its dim. is
وُرَيِّئَةٌ, (K,) accord. to those who hold the
وَرُاَ to be
a radical letter, not substituted for ى; namely,
the Basrees: accord. to others, وُرَيَّةٌ and وُرَىٌّ.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  [See also art. ورى.] ―
-b5-  رَجُلٌ مَانِعٌ مَا
وَرَآءَ ظهْرِهِ: see زَبُّونَةٌ. ―
-b6-  وَرَآءٌ A son's son, or
son's offspring. (K.) ―
-b7-  وَرَآءٌ Bulky, and thick
in the أَلْوَاح, or shoulder-blades. (AAF.)
