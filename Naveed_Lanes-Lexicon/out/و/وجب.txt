-b2-  Accord. to [the
Imám] Aboo-Haneefeh, وَاجِبٌ [in matters of
religion] is not so strong a term as فَرْضٌ: [and
so may be rendered incumbent, or obligatory;
or that which is a necessary, or indispensable,
duty; yet not so decisively or manifestly shown
to be such as that which is termed فرض:] or,
accord. to Esh-Sháfi'ee, these two terms are
syn., signifying [binding, incumbent, or obligatory, by God's express appointment, as] a
thing for neglecting which one will be punished:
and واجب signifies that which should be preferred and approved; thus explained by ElKhattábee as occurring in the following trad.:
غُسْلُ الجُمْعَةِ وَاجِبٌ عَلَى كُلِّ مُحْتَلِمٍ The

an act which every one who has experienced a

an operating cause; a result; a consequence.

dies; where one dies]. ―
-b2-  خَرَجَ القَوْمُ إِلَى
مَوَاجِبِهِمْ, i. e. الى مَصَارِعِهِمْ; The people went

to it; deserves it; merits it: syn. هُوَ وَلِيُّهُ, and
مُسْتَحِقُّهُ. (TA.)
