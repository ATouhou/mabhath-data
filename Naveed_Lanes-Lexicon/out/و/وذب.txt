وذبوِذَابٌ The stomach of a ruminant beast, (or,
as in some lexicons, the stomachs of such beasts,
TA,) with the intestines, or guts, into which milk
is put, and which are then cut in pieces, [and
eaten]: a pl. which has no sing. (ISd, K.) ―

Also The perforations, or punctures, made in
sewing, or the loops, (the word in the original is
خُرَبٌ, pl. of خُرَبْةٌ: in some of the lexicons, خُرَزٌ:
but both these words relate to the same things:
TA: [whence it appears that, accord. to the
author of the TA, &c., the former of the above
two meanings is the one intended:]) of a
مَزَادَة. (K.)
