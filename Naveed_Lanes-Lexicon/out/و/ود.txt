ود1
وَدَّهُ, first pers. وَدِدْتُ, (S, M, L, Msb,
K, &c.) and وَدَدْتُ, (Ks, Z, K,) [but most disallow this] aor. يَوَدُّ, inf. n. وُدٌّ and وِدٌّ and وَدٌّ,
(S, M, L, K,) of which three forms the first is
the most common, (MF,) and مَوَدَّةٌ, (S, M, L,
K,) or this last is a simple subst., (Msb,) and
مِوَدَّةٌ (CK and some MS. copies of the K) and
مَوِدَّةٌ, (accord. to some other copies of the K,
this and the next preceding deviating from the
common forms of inf. ns., TA,) and مَوْدِدَةٌ (M,
Kz, K) and مَوْدَدَةٌ, (TA,) but these last two are
allowable only in poetry, and deviate from constant rule, the former doubly, (Kz, MF, TA,)
and وِدَادٌ and وَدَادٌ and وُدَادٌ, (M, L, K,) the first
of which last three forms is the most common,
(MF,) and وَدَادَةٌ (M, L, K) and, accord. to some,
وِدَادَةٌ and وُدَادَةٌ, (MF, TA,) and, as in a copy
of the K esteemed of good authority, مَوْدُودَةٌ,
(TA,) He loved, or affected, him, or it, (S, M,
L, Msb, K,) i. e. any means of attaining or doing
good. (AZ, M, L.) The form وَدَدْتُ is disallowed by the Basrees who hold it to be erroneous: and Zj says, We know that Ks did not
mention وَدَدْتُ without having heard it; but he
heard it from him who was no authority. (T, L.)
―
-b2-  أَوْدِدْهُ, an imp. form [of ↓ أَوَدَّهُ], without
idghám, accord. to the dial. of El-Hijáz, occurs
in a trad., meaning Love thou it, or affect it.
(L.) ―
-b3-  وَدِدْتُ لَوْ تَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ. and وَدَدْتُ لَوْ أَنَّكَ
تَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ, (S, L,) aor. as above, inf. n. وُدٌّ and
وَدٌّ and وَدَادَةٌ (S, L, Msb) and وَدَادٌ (S, L) or
وِدَادٌ, (T, in TT,) I wished that thou wouldest do
that. (S, L.) ―
-b4-  وَدِدْتُ لَوْ كَانَ كَذَا I wished
that it had been so. (Msb.) ―
-b5-  وَدِدْتُ الشَّىْءَ I
wished for the thing. Fr says, This is the more
approved form; but some say وَدَدْتُ: in both
cases the aor. is يَوَدَّ only. (L.) [Respecting
the latter form of the pret., see above.] This is
a secondary signification of the verb. (TA.)

the second of the above senses, (S, K,) [and the
third]; and وَدِيدٌ is also mentioned as a pl. in
the second of the above senses in the K; but
this is probably a mistake for وِدَادٌ. (TA.) ―
-b5-

ذُو وُدٍّ; but وِدٌّ does not require ذو to be understood, being syn. with صَدِيقٌ. (L.)

interpretation. (TA.)
