وذر1
وَذِرَهُ, of the same measure as وَسِعَهُ, (S, K,
TA,) or وَذَرَهُ, (Lth, ISk, T, TA,) is the original
pret. of which the aor. is يَذَرُهُ (Lth, ISk, T, S,
K, TA) signifying, He leaves, lets alone, or
ceases or desists from, it, or him; he leaves it
undone; syn. يَدَعُهُ, (ISk, T, S, K, TA,) and
يَتْرُكُهُ; (Msb;) imp. ذَرْهُ, syn. دَعْهُ: (ISk, T, S,
K, TA:) but the pret. is not used, (Lth, Sb,
ISk, T, S, M, Msb, K,) تَرَكَهُ being used in its
stead; (Lth, T, S, TA;) and because its pret.
is not used, the aor. is of the measure يَفْعَلُ; for
if there were a pret., [it would most probably be
of the measure فَعَلَ, as this is the regular measure
of trans. unaugmented triliteral verbs, and] the
aor. would be of the measure يَفْعُلُ or يَفْعِلُ: (Sb,
M, TA:) nor is the inf. n. used, (Lth, T, M,
Msb, K, TA,) تَرْكٌ being used in its stead, (Lth,
T, M, TA,) i. e., instead of وَذْرٌ: (K:) nor is the
act. part. n., (ISk, T, S, Msb, K,) namely وَاذِرٌ,
instead of which تَارِكٌ is used: (ISk, T, S:) or
the pret. is sometimes used, (Msb, K,) though
rarely, (Msb,) or by the deviation from the constant course of speech: (K:) so in the K; but
in the M it is said, that the phrase لَمْ أَذِرْ وَرَآئِى
شَيْئًا [I left not behind me anything, with kesr
to the ذ, and so in the original copy of the TT,]
is related on the authority of some of the Arabs.
(TA.) You say, ذَرْ ذَا and دَعْ ذَا [Leave thou, or
let alone, or cease or desist from, this]. (ISk,
T.) It is said in the Kur, [lxxiii. 11,] وَذَرْنِى
وَالْمُكَذِّبِينَ And leave me, or let me alone, with
the beliers, or descrediters; (Bd;) commit their
case to me, (Bd, TA,) and busy not thy heart
respecting them; (TA;) for I will stand thee
in stead to recompense them. (Bd.)
