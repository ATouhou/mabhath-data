The verse of Lebeed,
تَسْلُبُ الكَانِسَ لَمْ يُوأَرْ بِهَا
شُعْبَةَ السَّاقِ إِذَا الظِّلُّ عَقَلْ
means She carries off from the gazelle entering
his covert, he not being frightened by her. the
branch of the trunk of the tree above him, when
the shade contracts, or decreases, or goes away,
at midday: he is describing his swift she-camel.
