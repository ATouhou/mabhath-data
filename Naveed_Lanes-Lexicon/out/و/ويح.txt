ويحوَيْحٌ a word denoting compassion, or pity:
(AZ, As, S, K:) وَيْلٌ denotes [an imprecation
of] punishment; (S;) or [of] removal from
good, or from prosperity: (AZ, As:) or [of]
destruction: (AZ:) and وَيْسٌ denotes the same
as ويح; (AZ;) or less than ويح: (As:) or
ويح and ويس denote compassion, or pity, and
admiration of one's beauty; as when you say of
a child, وَيْحَهُ مَا أَمْلَحَهُ, and وَيْسَهُ ما املحه,
[Mercy on him! or the like: how beautiful is
he!] (Kh) or, accord. to most of the lexicologists, ويل is a word said to, or of, any one
who falls into destruction or trial, or misfortune,
and on whom one does not wish God's mercy:
and ويح is said to, or of, any one who falls into
trial or misfortune, and for whom one wishes
God's mercy, and his escape therefrom: the
former word being so used in the Kur-án, and
the latter by the Prophet: (T:) or ويل is said
to, or of, him who falls into destruction: and
ويح is a word by which one chides him who is
at the point of falling into destruction: (Sb:)
or ويح and ويل are syn., (Yz, En-Nadr, S,
Ibn-Et-Faraj,) and ويس signifies the same:
(Ibn-El-Faraj:) or ويح is a little softer, or
more gentle, than ويل: (En-Nadr:) [if so,
وَيْحَهُ signifies woe to him: in the same, or in a
milder, manner than وَيْلَهُ:] or the original of
ويح is وَيْ; sometimes ح being added to this
latter word, and sometimes ل and sometimes
ب, and sometimes س; (K;) so that it becomes
ويح and ويل and ويب and ويس. (TA.) [See
ويل and ويب and ويس and وي.] You say وَيْحٌ
لِزَيْدٍ [Mercy on Zeyd! or woe to Zeyd!]; putting
ويح in the nom. case as an inchoative; (S, K;)
and in like manner, وَيْلٌ لِزَيْدٍ: (S:) and also
وَيْحًا لِزَيْدٍ; putting ويح in the acc. case because
of a verb understood; (S, K;) as though you
said أَلْزَمَهُ اللّٰهُ وَيْحًا [May God make mercy, or
woe, to attend him constantly!]; and in like
manner, وَيْلًا لِزَيْدٍ: (S:) or [it is put in the
acc. case as an absolute complement of a verb
understood, i. e., as an inf. n., and] the meaning
is أَتَرَحَّمُهُ تَرَحُّمًا. [I say, May God have mercy
on him! emphatically]: (Z, in the Fáïk:) you
also say وَيْحَكَ, and وَيْحَ زَيْدٍ; (S, K;) making
ويح a prefixed n.; (S;) and putting it in the
acc. case again because of a verb understood;
(S, K;) and in like manner, وَيْلَكَ, and وَيْلَ زَيْدٍ:
(S:) and also وَيْحَمَا زَيْدٍ in the same sense.
(K.)
