(S, A, K:) said to him who pretends one thing
and means another: (A, K:) originating from
the fact that some people employed a slave belonging to them to guard the fresh ripe dates of
their palm-trees, and he used to eat them, and,
when reproved for his evil conduct, laid the
blame upon the warashán; wherefore this was
said to him. (Sgh.)

but others say, that وارش has the first signification only, relating to food: and that of a sponger
desiring food. (TA.) See رَاشِنٌ and طُفَيْلِىٌّ.
