ورب1
وَرِبَ, aor. يَوْرَبُ, inf. n. وَرَبٌ, It, or he, (a
root, origin, or stock, S, or a man, TA,) was, or
became, corrupt. (S, K.)
2
ورّب, inf. n. تَوْرِيبٌ, [app., He expressed
himself respecting a thing equivocally, or ambiguously, by words objectionable in one sense,
and allowable in another: so thinks IbrD:]
the inf. n. is thus explained: أَنْ تُوَرِّىَ عَنِ
الشَّىْءِ بِالمُعَارَضَاتِ وَالمُبَاحَاتِ. (T, K, but in the
latter, the و before the last word is omitted.)
3
وارب, inf. n. مُوَارَبَةٌ He strove to outwit,
deceive, beguile, or circumvent [another]: syn.
دَاهَى and خَاتَلَ. (K.) Accord. to IAth, it is
from الوَرَبُ “ the being corrupt: ” or it may be
from الارب “ intelligence, &c.; ” the أ being
changed into و. The latter is the opinion of
AM. (L.) ―
-b2-  One of the sages says, مُوَارَبَةُ
الأَرِيبِ جَهْلٌ وَعَنَاءٌ [The striving to outwit the
cunning, or intelligent, or sagacious, is ignorance
and labour without profit]. (TA.) [See art.
أرب, where this saying, but with مؤاربة in the
place of مواربة, is given as a trad.] ―
-b3-  It is
said in a trad., إِنْ بَايَعْتَهُمْ وَارَبُوكَ, i. e., خَادَعُوكَ,
If thou buy and sell with them, they will deceive
thee, or endeavour to deceive the. (IAth.)
وَرْبٌ The hole of a wild beast: pl. أَوْرَابٌ.
(K, TA.) ―
-b2-  وَرْبٌ The space between two ribs;
مَا بَيْنَ الضِّلَعَيْنِ: (K:) but this (says SM) I find
not in any other book than the K; and probably
it should be ما بين إِصْبَعَيْنِ the space between
two fingers; for we read in the L that ورب is
said to signify مابين الأَصَابِعِ: (TA:) pl. أَوْرَابٌ.
(K, TA.) [See also أَرْبٌ.] ―
-b3-  وَرْبٌ The space
measured by the extension of the thumb and forefinger; syn. فِتْرٌ: pl. أَوْرَابٌ. (K, TA.)
-A2-  وَرْبٌ
A member; a limb: pl. أَوْرَابٌ. (K, TA.) ↓ وِرْبٌ
[also] is a dial. from of إِرْبٌ, (K,) as signifying
“ a member, or limb. ” (TA.) The form of
word commonly known, says AM, is إِرْبٌ; but
I do not deny that ورب may be a dial. form,
like as وِرْثٌ and إِرْثٌ are two words whereof one
is a dial. form of the other. (TA.) ―
-b2-  وَرْبٌ
and ↓ وَرْبَةٌ The podex: syn. إِسْتٌ: pl. of the
former أَوْرَابٌ. (K, TA.) ―
-b3-  ↓ وَرْبَةٌ The pit, or
hollow, that is in the lower part of the side, i. e.,
the hypochondre, or flank. (TA.) ―
-b4-  وَرْبٌ The
mouth of the hole of a rat, or mouse, (فَأْرَة,) and
of a scorpion: pl. أَوْرَابٌ. (K.)
وِرْبٌ: see وَرْبٌ.
وَرْبَةٌ: see وَرْبٌ.
وَرِبٌ Corrupt. (K.) ―
-b2-  عِرْقٌ وَرِب A corrupt
root, origin, or stock. (S, K.) Aboo-Dharrah
El-Hudhalee says,
إِنْ تَنْتَسِتْ تُنْسَبْ إِلَى عِرْقٍ وَرِبْ
[If thou mention thy lineage, thy lineage is
traced up to a corrupt origin, or stock]. (S.) ―
-b3-
رَجُلٌ وَرِبٌ A corrupt man. (TA.) ―
-b4-  وَرِبٌ A
