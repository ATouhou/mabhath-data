وحش1
وَحُشَ, aor.
وَحُشَ, [inf. n., probably, وُحُوشَةٌ or
وَحَاشَةٌ or both,] It (a place) abounded with wild
animals. (IKtt.) [The meaning assigned to this
verb in Freytag's Lex. belongs not to it, but to
وَخُشَ.]
-A2-  وَحَشَ بِهِ, or بِهَا,] aor. يَحِشُ, (IAar,
K,) inf. n. وَحْشٌ; (TK;) and بِهِ ↓ وحّش, (S,
K,) or بِهَا, (S, A,) which latter form of the verb
is disapproved by IAar, but both are correct;
(TA;) and ↓ توحّش [app. used alone, the objective complement being understood]; (TA;)
He threw it, or them, away, (S, K,) or to a
distance, (A,) namely, his garment, (S, K,) or
his garments, (A,) and his sword, (TA,) and his
spear, (S, TA,) and his weapon, or weapons,
(S, A,) or anything, (TA,) to lighten himself,
(A,) or his beast of carriage, (TA,) in fear of
his being overtaken: (S, K:) [or in any case;
for] it is said in a trad. of El-Ows and ElKhazraj, فَوَحَشُوا بِأَسْلِحَتِهِمْ واعْتَنَقَ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا
[Then they threw away their weapons, and embraced one another]. (TA.)

اوحش It (a place, A, Msb, or a place of
alighting or abode, S, K) was, or became, desolate,
deserted, or destitute of human beings; (S, A,
Msb, K,) the people having gone from it; (S,
K;) as also ↓ توحّش. (A, Msb, K.) And [in
like manner you say of a land,] الأَرْضُ ↓ توحّشت,
[and ↓ استوحشت, (see أَرْضٌ وَحْشَةٌ, voce وَحْشٌ,)]
The land was, or became وَحْشَة (S, TA) [i. e.
desolate, deserted, &c.] ―
-b2-  He (a man) was, or
became, hungry; (S, A, K, TA;) not having
eaten anything, so that his inside was empty;
(TA;) as also ↓ توحّش: (A:) or the latter
signifies his belly became empty by reason of
hunger. (S, K.) Also the former, His provisions
became spent, or exhausted. (S, K.) You say,
قَدْ أَوْحَشْنَا مُنْذُ لَيْلَتَيْنِ Our provisions have been
spent for two nights. (S.) You say also, ↓ توحّش
لِلدَّوَآءِ (S, A, K *) He made himself hungry;
(A;) or made his inside, (S,) or his stomach,
(K,) empty of food (S, K) and beverage; (K;)

-b2-  اوحش الرَّجُلَ (S,
A) He made the man lonely, or solitary; and
sad, sorrowful, or disquieted or troubled in mind;
[by his absence, or withdrawal of himself; and
afraid;] or he made him to feel, or experience,
وَحْشَة [i. e. loneliness, or solitude, &c.]; (S;)
contr. of آنَسَهُ, (S, K, in art. أنس,) inf. n. إِينَاسٌ.
(S, in that art.) Hence the saying of the people
of Mekkeh, [and of Egypt,] أَوْحَشْتَنَا [Thou hast
made us lonely, &c., by thine absence]. (TA.)
[See also an ex. from a poet, voce أُنْسٌ: And
see its quasi-pass., 10.]

توحّش He (a beast) became wild, or shy;
syn. أَبَدَ, (S, A, K, &c., in art. أبد,) and تَأَبَّدَ.
(A, L, in that art.) And He (a man) became
unsocial, unsociable, unfamiliar, or shy; like a
wild animal; syn. أَبِدَ, (S, K, ubi supra,) and
تَأَبَّدَ: (A, K, ubi supra;) and ↓ استوحش signifies the same; (see this verb below;) or he
became, or made himself, as though on a par with
the wild animals; expl. by لَحِقَ بَالْوَحْشِ. (TA.)
[See exs. of both voce أَنِسَ.] ―
-b2-  See also 4, in
five places. ―
-b3-  And see 1.
10
استوحش: see 5. ―
-b2-  It is also quasi-pass.
of أَوْحَشَ الرَّجُلَ, (S, TA,) and [thus] signifies
He felt, or experienced, وَحْشَة [i. e. loneliness, or
solitude, &c.; and sadness, grief, sorrow, or disquietude or trouble of mind, &c.; and fear, &c.].
(S, * K, TA.) And استوحش إِلَى الشَّىْءِ [He felt

say also استوحش مِنْهُ, (A, TA,) or عَنْهُ, (Msb,)
[meaning He was afraid of, or feared, him, or
it; agreeably with an explanation of the inf. n.
in Har, p. 331: see also an instance below, voce
وَحْشٌ: or] meaning he was shy of him; averse
from him; unsocial, unsociable, or unfamiliar,
with him; and like a wild animal. (TA.) ―
-b3-
استوحشت الأَرْضُ: see 4.
-A2-  [He deemed a word,
or sound, &c., strange, or uncouth.]
حِشَةٌ: pl. حِشُونَ: see وَحْشٌ.
وَحْشٌ, applied to a country, or region, (S, K,)
and a place, (TA,) and a house (داَرٌ), (A,) and
[its fem.] وَحْشَةٌ, applied to a land (أَرْضٌ), (S,
TA,) to a house (دار); (A;) Desolate, deserted,
or destitute of human beings or inhabitants; (S,
K, TA;) as also ↓ مُوحِشٌ and ↓ مُتَوَحِّشٌ: (A:)
and أَرْضٌ وَحْشَةٌ and ↓ مُسْتَوْحِشَةٌ signify the same.
(K, TA.) You say also, بِلَادٌ حِشُونَ Countries,
or regions, desolate, deserted, &c.; after the
manner of سِنُونَ; and in the accus. and gen.,
حِشِينَ: pl., as Az says, of ↓ حِشَةٌ, originally
وَحْشٌ, [So I read instead of وَحْشَة, which is
evidently a mistranscription,] the و being wanting, as it is in زِنَةٌ and صِلَةٌ and عِدَةٌ. (TA.)
You also say, لَقِيتُهُ بِوَحْشِ إِصْمِتَ, (S, K,) and
إِصْمِتَةَ, (TA,) i. e., I found him, or met him, in
a desolate, or deserted, country, or region. (S,
K.) [See remarks on the last word in the
former phrase in art. صمت.] And in like
manner, تَرَكْتُهُ بِوَحْشِ المَتْنِ I left him in the
desert part of the elevated plain, where one could
not reach him. (L, TA. *) And [hence] حِمَارُ
وَحْشٍ An ass of a desert; [i. e. a wild ass;] as
also حِمَارٌ وَحْشِىٌّ. (S, K.) [And بَقَرُ الوَحْشِ
The bull and cow, or bulls and cows, collectively,
of the desert; i. e., the wild bull and cow, or
bulls and cows.] ―
-b2-  [Hence also] Animals (حَيَوَان
[which is used as a sing. and a pl., but is here
meant to be understood collectively, as appears
from what follows,]) of the desert, (S, A, K,
TA,) such as are not tame; (TA;) [i. e. wild
animals;] of the fem. gender; (TA;) as also
وُحُوشٌ (S) and ↓ وَحِيشٌ: (K:) these three words
are all used in a collective sense: (ISh:) and
↓ وَحْشِىٌّ signifies a single one of such animals;
(S, K;) like زَنْجِىٌّ in relation to زَنْجٌ, and رُومِىٌّ
to رُومٌ: (TA:) or وَحْشٌ signifies such as is not
tame, of beasts of the desert; and everything that
is afraid of human beings (كُلُّ شَىْءٍ يَسْتَوْحِشُ
عَنِ النَّاسِ); as also ↓ وَحْشِىٌّ, as though the ى
were a corroborative, as in دوَّارِىٌّ: or, accord.
to El-Fárábee, وَحْشٌ in the pl. [lexicologically,
but not in the language of the grammarians] of
↓ وَحْشِىٌّ, like as رُومٌ is of رُومِىٌّ: (Msb:) or it
is used as a sing., as well as collectively; for
you say, هٰذَا وَحْشٌ ضَخْمٌ [this is a bulky wild
animal], and هٰذِهِ شَاةٌ وَحْشٌ [this is a wild sheep
or goat, &c.]: (ISh:) وُحُوشٌ is a pl. of وَحْشٌ,
(Msb, K,) and so is وُحْشَانٌ, (Sgh, K,) and so
is وَحِيشٌ, [lexicologically, but grammarians
term it a quasi-pl. n.,] like as ضَئِينٌ is of ضَأْنٌ:
(Sgh, TA:) or وُحُوشٌ is its only broken pl.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also, Wild, or shy; applied
to girls or women: see an ex. of the word in
this sense voce تَوٌّ, where it has a redundant ن
affixed to it.] ―
-b4-  [Hence also] Lone; solitary;
without company. You say. مَشَى فِى الأَرْضِ
وَحْشًا He walked, or went, in the land alone,
having no other with him. (TA.) ―
-b5-  [Hence
also] Hungry; (S, A, K;) as also ↓ مُوحِشٌ,
(AZ, A,) and ↓ مُتَوَحِّشٌ, (A,) and ↓ وَحِشٌ:
(TA:) pl. of the first, أَوْحَاشٌ (S, A, K) [and
وَحْشُونَ]. You say, بَاتَ فُلَانٌ وَحْشًا, (S, A, *
K, *) and مُوحِشًا, and مُتَوَحِّشًا, (A,) Such a one
passed the night hungry, (S, A, K,) not having
eaten anything, so that his inside was empty.
(TA.) And بِتْنَا وَحْشِينَ We passed the night
without food. (TA.) [In another place in the
TA, we find لَقَدْ بِتْنَا لَيْلَتَنَا هٰذِهِ وَحْشِى, and so
in the L; the last word being evidently a
mistranscription, for وَحْشِينَ: and it is added,
as though the speaker meant, جَمَاعَةَ وَحْشَى;
doubtless a mistake for جَمَاعَةَ وَحْشٍ so that the
saying seems to mean, We have passed this our
night like a company of wild animals.]
وَحِشٌ: see وَحْشٌ, last signification.
وَحْشَةٌ Loneliness; solitude; lonesomeness; solitariness; desolateness; syn. خَلْوَةٌ: (S, K:)
sadness; grief; sorrow; disquietude, or trouble,
of mind: (S, K, TA:) or sadness, &c., arising
from loneliness or solitude: (TA:) fear: (K,
TA:) or fear, or fright, arising from loneliness
or solitude: (TA:) a state of disunion between
men, and remoteness of hearts from feelings of
love or affection; from وَحْشٌ signifying “ a
wild beast,” or “ wild beasts, of the desert: ”
(Msb:) unsociableness; unfriendliness; unsocialness; unfamiliarity; shyness; wildness: [in all
the above senses] contr. of أُنْسٌ. (T, S, A, K,
in art. أنس.) [Hence, لَيْلَةُ الوَحْشَةِ The night of
loneliness, &c.; the first night after burial: also
called لَيْلَةُ الوَحْدَةِ, q. v.] You say, تَرَكْتُهُ فِى
وَحْشَةٍ I left him in loneliness, or solitude. (TK.)
And أَخَذَتْهُ الوَحْشَةُ Sadness, grief, sorrow, or
disquietude or trouble of mind, or sadness, &c.,
arising from loneliness or solitude, laid hold upon
him. (TA.)
وَحْشِىٌّ [Of, or belonging to, or relating to, the
desert: and hence, wild; untamed; undomesticated; uncivilized; unfamiliar: and often used
as an epithet in which the quality of a subst. is
predominant]: see وَحْشٌ, in three places: i. q.
حُوشِىٌّ; (S, Msb, art. حوش;) contr. of أَهْلِىٌّ.
(TA, in art. اهل.) ―
-b2-  كَلَامٌ وَحْشِىٌّ (tropical:)  i. q. حُوشِىٌّ,
q. v. (S, A, art. حوش:) and in like manner,

―
-b3-  The right side of anything: (AZ, AA, S,
K, &c.:) or the left side (As, S, A, K,) of anything. (As, S.) [For more full explanations of
this term, and its contr. إِنْسِىٌّ, in relation to a
beast and to a man, see the latter term: of a
beast, accord. to most authorities, it is The right,
far or off, side. See an ex. in a verse cited
voce دَفٌّ.] Of the arm or hand, and of the leg
or foot, The back; إِنْسِىٌّ signifying the side that
is towards the man: (S:) or of the foot, the
former means [the outer side, or] the side that is
the more remote from the other foot; the latter
being the contr., or that which is towards the
other foot. (TA.) Of a bow, (S, K,) or of a
Persian bow, (TA,) The back; and إِنْسِىٌّ, the
side that is towards thee: (S, K:) or of a bow,
whether Persian or not is not said, the former
means the side against which the arrow does not
lie. (TA.) And ↓ الجَانِبُ الوَحِيشُ signifies the
same as الوَحْشِىُّ. (IAar.) ―

end.
أَرْضٌ مَوْحُوشَةٌ A land having, (Fr, S, A,) or
