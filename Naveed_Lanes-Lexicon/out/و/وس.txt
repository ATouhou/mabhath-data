وسR. Q. 1
وَسْوَسَ, [inf. n. وَسْوَسَةٌ and وِسْوَاسٌ,
and simple subst. وسْوَاسٌ, but see ظأْظَأَ,] He
spoke, or talked, indistinctly: (TA:) [or in a
low, faint, gentle, or soft manner, with confusedness: for] Aboo-Turáb is related to have said,
that he heard Khaleefeh say, وَسْوَسَةٌ signifies the
speaking in a low, faint, gentle, or soft, manner,
with confusedness: or, accord. to one relation, it
is [وَشْوَشَةٌ,] with ش. (TA.) [It is generally
intrans., agreeable with the above explanations:
but sometimes trans.; for you say,] وَسْوَسَ الرَّجُلَ
He spoke to the man with low, faint, gentle, or
soft, speech. (M.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] وَسْوَسَتٌ إِلَيْهِ نَفْسُهُ,
(S, M, * A, * Msb, K, *) and وَسْوَسَ إِلَيْهِ الشَّيْطَانُ,
(S, A, * Msb, K,) and لَهُ, (S, Msb, K,) and فِيهِ,
(TA,) or فِى صَدْرِهِ, (M,) inf. n. وَسْوسَةٌ (S, M,
A, Msb, K) and وِسْوَاسٌ, with kesr, (S, A, Msb,
K,) and وَسْوَاسٌ, with fet-h, is also allowable in
the case of this and similar reduplicative verbs,
(MF, voce ظَأْظَأَ,) or this last is a simple subst.,
(S, Msb, K,) His mind, or soul, (S, M, A, &c.,)
and the devil, (S, A, Msb, K,) prompted, or
suggested to him [something], or talked to him,
(S, M, Msb,) and [in him, or] in his bosom:
(M:) or suggested to him, or talked to him of,
(A, * K,) and suggested in him, or talked in him
of, (TA,) what was vain, or unprofitable, and
destitute of good: (A, K, TA:) and in like
manner one says of the thoughts. (TA.) By
the prep. ل by which it is made trans. in the
Kur, in vii. 19, is meant إِلَى. (S, Msb.) You
say also, وُسْوِسَ بِهِ [as though signifying properly
He had vain things suggested in him by the devil,
so that his mind was disturbed thereby, and] his
speech became confused, and he became stupified,
or deprived of his reason. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence
also,] وَسْوَسَ الحَلْىُ, (M, A, Bd, in vii. 19,) inf.

(M:) or made a low, or gentle, sound; or a
chinking. (Bd, [who holds this to be a primary
signification: but it is said in the A to be tropical.]) And وَسْوَسَ القَصَبُ (tropical:)  [The reeds made a
low sound; or rustling]. (A.) And سَمِعْتُ
وِسْوَاسَهُ (tropical:)  I heard its low sounding, or its chinking;
or its rustling]. (A.) See also وَسْوَاسٌ.

-b2-  And hence,] The soul's, or
mind's, (S, M, Msb, K,) and the devil's, (K,)
prompting, or suggestion, or talk, (S, M, Msb,
K,) of what is vain, or unprofitable, and destitute
of good; (K;) as also ↓ وَسْوَسَةٌ [used as subst.,

the black bile, attended with confusion of the
intellect. (Msb.) ―

signification seem to be derived those which here
follow.] (assumed tropical:)  The low, or faintly heard, sound of

-A2-  Also, الوَسْوَاسُ
The devil; (M, K;) a name of the devil: (S:)
it occurs in verse 4 of the last chap. of the Kur;
and is said to mean there ذُو الوَسْوَاسِ [the
prompter, or suggester, of what is vain, or unprofitable, and destitute of good. (M.)
مَرَضٌ وَسْوَاسِىٌّ [A disease of the nature of

مُوَسْوِسٌ, with kesr, A man subject to وَسَاوِس
[or diabolical promptings, or suggestions, of vain,
or unprofitable, things, and thereby confused in

because he to whom it is applied talks to himself: and one also says مُوَسْوَسٌ, [or مُوَسْوَسٌ إِلَيْهِ,]
like المَغْضُوبُ عَلَيْهِمْ: (Msb.) or, accord. to
IAar, one should not say مُوَسْوَسٌ. (TA.)
