وَجَسَانٌ: see 1, and وَجْسٌ.
وَجَّاسٌ is syn. with عَالِمٌ [Knowing, &c.]; and
therefore made trans. by means of بِ in the saying of Aboo-Dhu-eyb,
ذُو مِرَّةٍ بِدِوَارِ الصَّيْدِ وَجَّاسُ
[An intelligent person, acquainted with the circumvention of game: see دَاوَرَهُ]: (M, art. دور:)
(ISd holds it to be a possessive epithet, since it
has no known verb [of a suitable meaning that
is unaugmented]: or [the meaning of these
words is, a person possessing skill in circumventing game, a listener, or attentive, to their sounds
and motions; for], accord. to Es-Sukkaree, رجّاس
means يَتَوَجَّسُ. (TA.)

One says, مَا دُقْتُ عِنْدَهُ أَوْجَسُ I tasted not, at
his abode, any food; (El-Umawee, S;) and [in
like manner] ↓ وَجْسًا. (TA.) And مَافِى سِقَائِهِ
أَوْجَسُ There is not in his skin a drop: thus the
phrase is given, without the mention of beverage:
or a drop of water. (TA.) It is said that the word
is not used except in negative phrases. (TA.)
―
-b2-  Also, الأَوْجَسُ and الأَوْجُسُ (S, K) the latter
on the authority of Yaakoob, (S, TA,) but the
former is the more chaste, (TA,) Time; syn.
الدِّهْرَ. (S, K.) Hence the saying, (TA,) لَاأَفْعَلُهُ
سَجِيسَ الأَوْجَسِ, (S, K,) and الأَوْجُسِ, (S,) I
will not do it ever. (ISk, S, K.) And أَفْعَلُهُ
سَجِيسَ عُجَِيْسَ الأَوْجَسٍ I will not do it while
time lasts. (El-Fárisee.)
