Thou art my prophet, and I reared thee:

of any kind: [often applied to an unborn child,
&c.; a fœtus:] (M, L, Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] of
وَلَدٌ, (M, L, Msb, TA,) and of وُلْدٌ, (M, L,)
أَوْلَادٌ; (M, L, Msb, K;) and [pl. of pauc. of
وَلَدٌ,] وِلْدَةٌ and إِلْدَةٌ: (M, L, K:) and pl. of وَلَدٌ,
وُلْدٌ, (S, M, L, Msb, K, *) like as أُسْدٌ is pl. of
أَسَدٌ, (S, L, Msb,) in the dial. of the tribe of
Keys, (T, Msb,) who make وَلَدٌ singular. (T.)
―
-b2-  مَنْ دَمَّى عَقِبَيْكِ ↓ وُلْدُكِ, a proverb, (T, S,

(S, L,) Thy son is he who made thy two heels to
be smeared with blood; (TA;) i. e., whom thou
thyself broughtest forth; (K, TA;) he is thy
son really; not he whom thou hast taken from
another, and adopted. (TA.) ―

(S, K.)
لِدَةٌ, in which the ة is a substitute for the
و that is elided from the beginning, for it is
from الوِلَادَةُ, (S, L,) or, accord. to some, it is
from لَدى, q. v., (TA,) applied to a male and
to a female, (TA, voce تِرْبٌ,) i. q. تِرْبٌ; (S, L,
K;) meaning One born at the same time with
another; coëtanean, or a contemporary in birth
(TA) of a man: (S, L:) dual لِدَانِ; (S, L;)
[but لِدَةٌ occurs in a dual sense in the Jm and O
and K, voce صَوْغٌ, q. v.;] pl. لِدَاتٌ and لِدُونَ: (S,
L, K:) AHei and other expositors of the Tesheel say, that words like لدة have the latter
form of pl. when they become proper names.
(TA.) The dim. [of the pl.] is وُلَيْدَاتٌ and
وُلَيْدُونَ, (K,) because the formation of a dim.
restores a word to its original form; (TA;)
not لُدَيَّاتٌ and لُدَيُّونَ, as some of the Arabs
erroneously make it: (K:) but this which F
pronounces an error is accordant to the authority
of the leading writers on inflexion, who say
that by regarding the original form, and restoring it thereto, the word is made to depart
from the meaning intended by it; for if its
dim. were made وُلَيْدٌ, there would be no difference between it and the dim. of وَلَدٌ. (TA.)

(M, L:) a young infant: (the former in the
L, and the latter in the Msb:) the former, as
well as the latter, masc.: (M, L:) or, accord.
to some, the former is applied also to a female:
as also ↓ وَلِيدَةٌ and ↓ مَوْلُودَةٌ: pl. of وليد, وِلْدَانٌ;
and of وليدة. (L.) ―

[They are in a case, or an affair, wherein (lit.
whereof) the boy, or servant-boy, or slave, will
not be called out to]: a proverb, (L,) originally
meaning, they are in a case of difficulty or
distress, such that the mother forgets her child,
and does not call out to him: and afterwards
applied to any case of difficulty or distress:
(M, L:) or they are in a formidable case, in
which children are not called out to, but those
advanced in age: (AO, or As, M, L:) and
sometimes it means, they are in such a state of
abundance and affluence that if a وليد put forth
his hand to take a thing he is not chidden away
from it: (M, L:) or it is applied to a case of
good and to one of evil, and means, they are so
occupied with their case or affair that if a وليد
put forth his hand to the most valuable of
things he is not called out to for the purpose of
chiding him: (K:) some say, that its original
reference is to the running of horses; because a
fleet and excellent horse goes without being
called out to; and that it is secondarily applied
to any case of great moment, and to any case
of abundance. (S, L.) ―
-b7-  One also says, فِى
الأَرْضِ عُشْبٌ لَا يُنَادَى وَلِيدُهُ [In the land is fresh
herbage respecting which the servant-boy, or slave,
will not be called out to]; because it matters not
in what part of such land the beasts are; the
whole abounding with herbage: and جَاؤُوا بِطَعَامٍ
لَا يُنَادَى وَلِيدُهُ [They brought food respecting
which the servant-boy, or slave, would not be
called out to]; meaning, that one would not
care what injury he might do to it, nor when he
ate of it. (ISk, L.) ―
-b8-  Muzarrid Eth-Thaalebee
says,
تَبَرَّأْتُ مَنْ شَتْمِ الرِّجَالِ بِتَوْبَةٍ
إِلَى اللّٰهِ مِنِّى لَا يُنَادَى وَلِيدُهَا

-b2-  شَاعِر مُوَلَّدٌ
(tropical:)  [A post-classical poet;] a poet of the last of
the four classes; of the class next after the
إِسْلَامِيُّون; also called مُحْدَثٌ: (Mz, 49th نوع:)
called by the former appellation [as well as the
latter] because of his recent age. (L, K.) [It
is difficult to mark the exact line of distinction
between the Islámees and the Muwelleds, so as
always to be certain to which of these two classes
a poet belongs. The latter are those born, not
merely since the first corruption of the Arabic
language, which happened in, or before, the
age of Mohammad, (see Mz, 44th نوع,) but
since the extensive corruption which happened
after the Arabs had spread themselves, by their
conquests, among foreigners, in consequence of
which their language became simplified. This
change took place in the latter half of the first
century of the Flight. Hence the poetry of
the Muwelleds in not cited as authoritative in
lexicology or grammar, or as to the metres of
verse, or rhymes. (See شَاهِدٌ.)] Ibn-Rasheek
mentions, as the most famous of the Muwelleds,
El-Hasan (surnamed Aboo-Nuwás) Habeeb, ElBohturee, Ibn-Er-Roomee, Ibn-El-Moatezz, and
El-Mutanebbee: [the first of whom died in
the year of the Flight 195, or -6, or -8]. Aboo-
'Amr Ibn-El- 'Alà [who died in the year of the
Flight 154, or -9,] termed El-Farezdak and Jereer
Muwelleds, in comparison with the Pagan poets
and the Mukhadrams, though others call them
Islámees. (Mz, 49th نوع.) ―
-b3-  كَلَامٌ مُوَلَّدٌ (tropical:)  [Postclassical,] or innovated, or modern, or modernized,
language; (L;) language which is not of the
original dialect of the Arabs; (A;) language
which is not genuine Arabic. (Msb.) And
simply مُوَلَّدٌ (tropical:)  [A post-classical phrase or word;]
a modernism; an innovated, or a modern, or
modernized, phrase or word; a phrase or word
innovated by any of the Muwelleds, whose
phrases or words are not cited as authoritative
[in lexicology, or grammar, or as to the metres
of verse, or rhymes: see above]: the difference
between it and the مَصْنُوع is, that the latter is
given by its author as chaste (فصيح) Arabic;
whereas this is the contrary [i. e., confessedly
innovated]. (Mz, 21st نوع.) It is opposed to
لُغَةٌ. The lexicons passim.) ―
-b4-  Also مُوَلَّدٌ, (L,)
