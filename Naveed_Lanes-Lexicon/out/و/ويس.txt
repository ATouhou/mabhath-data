ويسوَيْسٌ a word used to. denote compassion, or
pity, and admiration of one's beauty; (M, K;)
the object being a child; (K;) as when one
says of a child, وَيْسَهُ مَا أَمْلَحَهُ [Merry on him!
or the like: how beautiful is he!]: (TA:) or
وَيْسٌ and وَيْحٌ are used in the place of وَيْلٌ;
(TA;) and وَيْسٌ لَهُ signifies وَيْلٌ لَهُ [Woe to
him!]: (M, TA:) or, as some say, وَيْسٌ is a
word denoting contempt; and has no verb;
analogy forbidding that it should have one:
(IJ, M:) Aboo-Turáb says, I heard Abu-sSemeyda' say, وَيْسٌ and وَيْحٌ and وَيْلٌ have one
meaning: (TA:) or وَيْسَكَ is not said except to
children; and وَيْلَكَ is an expression in which is
roughness and reproach; and ويح is a gentle and
good expression. (AHát, TA.) See ويْحٌ and
وَيْلٌ and وَيْبٌ. ―
-b2-  It also signifies Poverty.
(ISk, M.) And one may say, if it be right to
say so to one, وَيْسٌ لَهُ as meaning Poverty be to
him. (ISk.) ―
-b3-  Also, What a man desires.
(M, K.) So in the phrase لَقِىَ وَيْسًا He found,
or met with, or experienced, what he desired;
(M, K;) accord. to an explanation given by
IAar; so that it means much: but in one place
he says that this phrase signifies he found, &c.,
what he did not desire. (M.)
ويل &c.
