وطأ1
وَطِئَ, aor. يَطَأُ; (S, K;) the و, falls out
from the aor. of this verb, and from that of
وَسِعَ, because they are transitive; for other
verbs of the class فَعِلَ, having the aor. of the
measure يَفْعَلُ, and the first radical letter infirm,
are intransitive; and as these two differ from
their class in being transitive, they are also
made to differ in the aor.; (S;) or يَطَأُ was
originally يَطِئُ, and therefore the و, falls out
from it; (TA;) inf. n. وَطْءٌ, (TA) [and طِئَةٌ, q.v.
infra]; and ↓ وطّأ, (K, but this has an intensive
signification, MF;) and ↓ توطّأ (S, K) He trod;
trod upon; (بِرِجْلِهِ with his foot; S) trod under
foot; trampled upon: (S, K, TA:) or وَطِئَهُ
signifies he pressed, or bore, upon him, or it,
with his hand or his foot. (TA, in art. ثطأ.)

-b3-  هُمْ يَطَؤُهُمُ الطَّرِيقُ (tropical:)  They (i. e. the
sons of such a one) sojourn, or encamp, near the
road, so that its passengers tread upon them
[i. e., became their guests]: (Sb, K:) a tropical
phrase, in which الطريق is put for أَهْلُ الطَّرِيقِ;
this being done to give greater force to the
phrase, as it is one expressive of praise; for the
road is a thing that is constant; whereas its
passengers are sometimes upon it, and sometimes
absent. (L.) [It means They are a people who
take up their abode near the road in order that
many passengers may enjoy their hospitality.]
―

it is only deemed a fault if it occur two, or
three, or more, times. (TA.)
