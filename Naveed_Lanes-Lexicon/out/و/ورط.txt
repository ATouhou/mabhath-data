ورط1
وَرَطَهَا He veiled, concealed, hid, or covered,
her, or it, or them; [to what the pronoun relates
is not said; but I incline to think that the right
reading is وَرَّطَهَا, and that the pronoun relates to
camels; (see 2;) as also ↓ اورطها: (L, TA:)
from IAar. (TA.)

ورّطهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَوْرِيطٌ, (S, Msb,)
He made him to fall into what is termed وَرْطَة
[properly and also tropically, or in its primary
sense and also in any of its subordinate senses];
as also ↓ اورطهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِيرَاطٌ:
(Msb:) both signify (assumed tropical:)  he made him to fall into
that from which he could not extricate himself:
(TA:) or into that from which he could not
easily extricate himself. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  ورّط إِبِلَهُ
فى إِبِلٍ أَخْرَى (assumed tropical:)  He hid, or concealed, his camels
among other camels [in order that they might
escape the notice of the collector of the
poor-rates]; as also ↓ اورط. (K.) [See also
1, and 3.]

وِرَاطٌ (S, Msb, TA) and مُوَارَطَةٌ (TA) [The
act of mutually making to fall into what is termed
وَرْطَة.
-A2-  And hence,] (assumed tropical:)  The act of mutually
deceiving, beguiling, or circumventing; or endeavouring to deceive, beguile, or circumvent;
(TA;) or the act of deceiving, beguiling, or circumventing; (S, Msb;) and the acting, or
advising, or counselling, dishonestly, or insincerely; (S, Msb, TA;) and ↓ وَرْطٌ and ↓ وِرَاطَةٌ,
the latter on the authority of J, [accord. to some
copies of the S, but in other copies وِرَاطٌ,] signify
the same [as substs.] (TA.) You say, لَا تُوَارِطْ
جَارَكَ فَإِنَّ الوِرَاطَ يُورِدُ الأَوْراَطَ (assumed tropical:)  [Do not thou
practise mutual deceit with thy neighbour, or
endeavour to deceiving him, &c., for the doing so
brings upon its author things, or affairs, from
which it is difficult to escape]. (Z, TA.) And
it is said in trad, لَا خِلَاطَ وَلَا وِرَاطَ, which is like
his [Mohammad's] saying, (assumed tropical:)  There shall be no
putting together what is separate, nor separating
what is put together, from fear of the poor-rate:
(S:) خلاط has been explained in its place:
(TA:) وراط [has also been variously explained
in that place, and, it is said,] signifies the putting
together what is separate: and the reverse: (K:)
or the dispersing camels (K, TA) among other
camels: (TA:) or the hiding camels among
other camels; (Th, K;) or in a low, or depressed,
piece of ground; in order that the collector of
the poor-rate may not see them: (K:) or the
making one another to fall into a وَرْطَة, (TA,)
one saying to the collector of the poor-rate,
“ Such a one has that for which a poor-rate is
due,” when he has not; (K, TA;) so accord. to
IAar: accord. to Ibn-Háni, it is from أَوْرَطَ
الجَرِيرَ فِى عُنُقِ البَعِيِرِ. (TA.) See 4.

أَوْرَطَ see 2, in two places; and 1. ―
-b2-  اورط
الجَرِيرَ فِى عُنُقِ البَعِير (assumed tropical:)  He put the end of the
جرير [q. v.] of the camel into its ring, and then
pulled it so as to throttle him. (Ibn-Háni. K.)
5
تورّط فِى وَرْطَةٍ He fell into what is termed
وَرْطَة [properly and also tropically, or in its
primary sense, and also in any of its subordinate
senses]. (S.) You say, تورّطتِ الغَنَمُ وَغَيْرُهَا The
sheep, or goats, &c., fell into mud from which they
could not extricate themselves; or into a depressed
piece of ground in which was no way directing
to escape: and hence the verb is used in relation
to any straitness or difficulty. (Msb.) Thus you
say, تورّط فُلَانٌ فِى الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one undertook,
or embarked in, the affair, and could not easily
extricate himself; and so فيه ↓ استورط: (Msb:)
or the former signifies (assumed tropical:)  he fell into the affair,
or case: (K:) or (assumed tropical:)  he became entangled in the
affair, and could not easily extricate himself
from it; (TA;) and so ↓ the latter: (Sh, K,
TA:) and تورّط and ↓ استورط both signify he
stuck fast: or (assumed tropical:)  he perished; or died. (TA.)

إِسْتَوْرَطَ see 5, in three places. ―
-b2-  استورط مَعَ فُلَانٍ
(assumed tropical:)  He behaved proudly, haughtily, or insolently,
in speech, with such a one. (TA.)
وَرْطٌ: see 3.
وَرْطَهٌ Slime, or thin mud, [in the CK, الرَّحْلُ
is erroneously put for الوَحْلُ,] into which sheep or
goats fall, and from which they cannot extricate
themselves: (Msb, K:) this, or, as some say,
what here next follows, is the primary signification: (Msb:) a low, or depressed, piece of ground
or land, in which is no way, or road, (S, Msb,
K,) directing to escape: (Msb:) this is said by
A'Obeyd to be the primary signification: (S:)
a deep hollow, cavity, or pit, in the ground:
(TA:) a deep hollow, cavity, or pit, formed for
the purpose of a stratagem, such as may be in a
mountain, occasioning difficulty to him who falls
into it: (As:) and hence, (TA,) a well: (K,
TA:) and anything that is غَامِض [app. here
meaning low, or depressed]: (K:) also, by
derivation from the first of these significations, (Msb,) or from the second, (S, Msb,)
[or some other,] (assumed tropical:)  perdition; or destruction;
or death: (S, Msb, K:) and (assumed tropical:)  [any embarrassing, or difficult, case, or affair;] any
case, or affair, from which escape is difficult: (K:) pl. [of pauc.] أَوْرَاطٌ, (S, IS,) the
ة in the sing. being app. regarded as elided;
(IS;) and [of mult.] وِرَاطٌ, (K,) and وَرَطَاتٌ.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, (tropical:)  The podex: or the anus: syn.
إِسْتٌ. (K, TA.)
وِرَاطَةٌ: see 3.
