وخز1
وَخَزَهُ, (S, A, Msb,) aor. يَخِزْهُ, (Msb,) inf.
n. وَخْزٌ (S, A, Msb, K) He pierced, stabbed, or
pricked him, with a spear, (S, A, Msb, K,) or
other thing, (K,) or with the like of a spear, as
a dagger, (S,) and a needle, (A, Msb,) &c.,
(Msb,) not making the instrument to pass through:
(S, A, Msb, K:) or, as some say, he did so
making the instrument to pass through: in a
trad., the plague (الطَّاعُون) is said to be a وَخْز
inflicted by jinn, or genii; and the word in this
instance is explained by some agreeably with
the former rendering, and by some agreeably
with the latter: or وَخْزٌ signifies a slight piercing,
and is like a goading: so accord. to Khálid
Ibn-Jembeh, who uses the expression وَخَزَ فِى
سَنَامِهَا بِمِبْضَعِهِ [He made a slight stab in her
hump with his scarifier]. (TA.) وَخْزٌ also signifies The act of scarifying; syn. تَبْزِيغٌ. (K.
[So in a MS copy of the K, and this is the right
reading: in the TA, تَبْزِيع, written with ع,
unpointed: in the CK, تَنْزِيع, with ن and ع
instead of ب and غ.]) You say of a farrier,
وَخَزَهُ بِمِبْضَعٍ وَخْزًا خَفِيفًا لَا يَبْلُغُ العَصَبَ [He
scarified it with a scarifier slightly, not penetrating to the sinews]; the pronoun referring to the
hoof of a horse or the like, and the place of the
operation being the part called the أَشَاعِر. (Aboo-
'Adnán, TA.)
وَخْزٌ The plague; syn. طَاعُونٌ. (TA.) See
above. ―
-b2-  Pain: [or, app., a piercing, or pricking, pain:] as in the following ex.: إِنِّى لَأَجِدُ
فِى يَدِى وخْزًا [Verily I feel, in my arm, or
hand, a pain, or a piercing, or pricking, pain].
(IAar, TA.)
