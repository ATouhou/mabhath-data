اورس المَكَانُ The place produced the plant
called وَرْس. (S.) ―
-b2-  اورس الرِّمْثُ The [trees
called] رمث produced وَرْس, a thing yellow like
the [garments termed] مُلَآء; as also ↓ وَرَسَ: so
it is asserted, on trustworthy authority: (M:)
or became yellow in their leaves, (S, K,) after
attaining to maturity, (S,) and had upon them
what was like yellow مُلَآء; (S, K;) and in like
manner one says of a place, اورس المَكَانُ: (TA:)
or became yellow in its fruit: (A:) ―
-b3-  اورس
الشَّجَرُ The trees put forth leaves; (K;) as also
↓ وَرِسَ. (IKtt.)
وَرْسٌ A certain plant, (S, A, Msb, K,) of a
yellow colour, (S, Msb,) resembling sesame, (A,
K,) with which one dyes, (A, Msb,) and of which
is made the [liniment called] غُمْرَة for the face,
(S,) existing in El-Yemen, (S, K,) and nowhere
else, (K,) being there sown; (Msb;) it is not
wild, but is sown one year, and remains ten years,
(AHn, M,) or twenty years, (K,) without ceasing
to be profitable, resembling sesame in its manner
of growth; and when it dries, on its attaining to
maturity, its pericarps (خَرَائِط) burst, and it is
shaken, and the وَرْس shakes out from it: (AHn,
M,) it is useful for the [discolouration of the face
termed] كَلَف, used as a liniment; and for the
[leprous-like discolouration of the skin termed
بَهَق, [prepared] as a drink; and the wearing
of a garment dyed with it strengthens the venereal
faculty: (K:) or a certain yellow dye: or, as
some say, a certain plant, of sweet odour: or, as
is said in the قَانُون [of Ibn-Seenà, or Avicenna,]
a certain thing of an intensely red colour, resembling powdered saffron, brought from El-Yemen,
and said to be scraped or rubbed off, or to fall
off, from its trees: (Mgh:) or, as some say, a
species of كُرْكُم, q. v.: or, as some say, resembling كُرْكُم: (Msb:) or a certain thing, yellow,
like the [garments of the kind called مُلَآء, that
comes forth upon the [trees called] رِمْث, between
the last part of summer and the first part of
winter, (M, TA,) which, when it touches a garment, soils it: (TA:) or it also, sometimes, [accord.
to certain persons who seems to misapply the
word, is a substance which] pertains to the [trees
called] عَرْعَر and رِمْث, and to other trees, above
all in Abyssinia; but this is inferior to that first
mentioned (K, TA) in virtue and properties: as
to that of the عرعر, it is found between its rind
and the main substance, when it dries up; and
when it is rubbed, it rubs off; and there is no
good in it; but ورس [properly so called] is adulterated with it: and as to that of the رمث, when
it is the end of summer, and it has attained its
utmost state, it becomes intensely yellow, so that
what envelops it becomes yellow, and with this
also one adulterates: so says AHn: (TA:) ورس
is called in Persian اسپرك [إِسْپَرِكْ]; and in
Turkish, آلاجهره. (TK.) [Freytag adds to what
he has given on this word from the K, S, TK.
as follows: “ Memecylon tinctorium. Sprengel.
hist. med., t. ii., p. 444, ed. tert. (ubi ورز scriptum est). Spreng. hist. rei herb., t. i., p. 258.
Avicenn. p. 165 ”]

yellowness. (K.) ―

وَرِيسٌ A garment dyed with وَرْس; as also
↓ وَرِسٌ and ↓ وَارِسٌ (M) and ↓ مُوَرَّسٌ. (M, A.)
You say, مَلْحَفَةٌ وِرِيسَةٌ, (so in some copies of
the S and K) or ↓ وَرْسِيَّةٌ, (as in other copies of
the S and K, and thus in a copy of the Msb,)

kind called رِمْث, Producing وَرْس, a thing yellow
like the [garments termed] مُلَآء: (M:) or becoming yellow in the leaves, (S, K,) after attaining to maturity, (S,) and having upon it what is
like yellow مُلَآءُ: (S, K:) or becoming yellow
in its fruit: (A:) or, app., having وَرْس, like as
تَامِرٌ signifies “ possessing dates; ” (AHn;) and
↓ وَرِيسٌ likewise has the last of these significations: (TA:) ↓ مُورِسٌ also signifies the same
as وَارِسٌ, applied to a tree of the kind abovementioned; (A, K;) but is very rare, though
agreeable with analogy: (K:) it is said (M)
one should not say مُوْرِسٌ; (S, M;) but it occurs
in a poem of Ibn-Harmeh. (M.) ―
