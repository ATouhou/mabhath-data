وَدَجٌ, (S, K,) also written with kesreh, [app.
وِدْجٌ, but perhaps وَدِجٌ,] (Msb,) and وِدَاجٌ, (S,
K,) [A name given to each of the external
jugular veins;] a certain vein in the neck; (S,
K;) one of two veins, which are called the
وَدَجَانِ: (T, S, &c.:) these are two veins extending from the head to the lungs; and the pl.
is أَوْدَاجٌ: (M:) or two great veins on the right
and left of the pit between the clavicles: (Msb,
TA:) they are by the side of the وَرِيدَانِ, [here
app. meaning the two carotid arteries,] and are
of the number of the veins in which the blood
[merely] runs, whereas the وريدان are for pulsation and for [the diffusion of] the soul, النفس
[i. e النَّفْس, not النَّفَس; for, accord. to the Arabs,
the animal soul (الرُّوحُ الحَيْوَانِىُّ, as is said in
the KT,) diffuses itself throughout the body,
from the heart, by means of the pulsing veins,
or arteries]: (T, Msb, TA:) accord. to some,
the ودج and وريد are the same; [meaning, that
each of these names is applied to the external
jugular vein:] (Msb:) or the اوداج are the
veins which surround the windpipe: (TA:) or
the ودج is the vein called the أَخْدَع, [elsewhere
said to be a branch from the وريد, in the place
where one is cupped,] which the slaughterer
[of an animal] cuts through, thereby putting an
end to life. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  وَدَجَانِ (tropical:)  Two brothers:
(S, K:) two persons mutually attached; likened

حَرْبٍ هُمَا Two evil brothers of war are they
two. (S.)
-A2-  وَدَجٌ (tropical:)  A cause; a means whereby
one attains to a thing; syn. سَبَبٌ and وَسِيلَةٌ;

Ex. كَانَ فُلَانٌ وَدَجِى إِلَى كَذَا Such a one was
my means of attaining to such a thing. (TA.)
