kesr, (K,) He bore, or carried, a heavy load,

Kur, [vi. 164, &c.,] وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى
Nor shall any [soul] bearing [a heavy burden]
bear the [heavy] burden of another soul; (S;) i. e.,
its burden of sin: (Mgh, Msb:) meaning, that
no one shall be punished for the sin of another;
nor shall any sinning soul bear the heavy burden
of another soul; every one shall be requited for
his [own] deeds: (TA:) or nor shall any sinning
[soul] sin by the sin of another. (Akh, S, TA.)

(Msb.) See also 8. ―

TA.) ―
-b4-  وَزَرَ لِلْأَمِيرِ, (A,) and لِلْسُّلْطَانِ, (Msb,
[this I believe to be the right reading; but in
the only copy of the Msb, that I have, I find it

[in which the syn. is written ثِقْل: so in two
copies; and so app. accord. to A 'Obeyd, who
makes its pl. أَثْقَال:] and Msb [in which, in my
copy, the syn. is written without syll. signs:]
and K [in which it is written ثِقَل:]) pl. أَوْزَارٌ.
(Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  (tropical:)  A weapon; an instrument of
war: or weapons; arms: syn. سِلَاحٌ: (S, Mgh,
Msb, K:) because heavy upon the wearer:
(Mgh, Msb:) or أَوْزَارٌ signifies the burdens and
instruments of war, &c.; and the sing. is وِزْرٌ;
(A 'Obeyd, TA;) or it has no sing., accord. to
some. (TA.) A poet says, (S,) namely El-Aashà,
(Mgh, TA.)
وَأَعْدَدْتُ لِلْحَرْبِ أَوْزَارَهَا
رِمَاحًا طِوَالًا وَخَيْلًا ذُكُورَا
[And I prepared for the war its weapons and
other apparatus; long lances and male horses].

[xlvii. 5,] حَيَّى تَضَعَ الْحَرْبُ أَوْزَارَهَا, meaning,
(tropical:)  Until the war terminates: (Mgh, Msb:) because
then the people thereof lay down their arms:
(Mgh:) properly, until the people of the war lay
down their burdens: (Msb:) their weapons and
burdens: or, as some say, their sins. (Bd.) ―

(tropical:)  A sin: (S, Bd, ubi supra, and Msb, K:) and

which it is most frequently used in the traditions.
(IAth.)
وَزَرٌ A mountain: this is the primary signification: (S:) or a mountain difficult of access, or
strong: (K, TK:) or a mountain to which one
betakes himself for refuge: this is the primary
signification. (Aboo-Is-hák.) ―
-b2-  A place of
refuge: (S, Msb, K:) any such place. (Aboo-Is-hák, K.) So in the Kur, lxxv. 11. (TA.)
―

وَزِيرٌ i. q. مُوَازِرٌ [One who bears a burden or
burdens with another: or one who aids, assists or
helps, and strengthens, another: see 3:] (S, A, K:)
like as أَكِيلٌ signifies i. q. مُؤَاكِلٌ, (S,) and
جَلِيسٌ i. q. مُجَالِسٌ. (A.) ―
-b2-  (tropical:)  [A vicegerent of
a king or the like: or a confidential minister of
state: in English commonly written vizier, in
imitation of the Turkish pronunciation; but properly, wezeer:] the familiar of the king, who
bears his master's burden, and aids him by his
counsel: (K:) or the وزير of the king is the
person who bears with him (يُوَازِرُهُ, i. e. يُحَامِلُهُ,)
the burdens of the regal office: not from مُوَازَرَةٌ,
signifying the “ act of aiding or the like,” because
the و in this latter word is substituted for ء, and
the derivative from it of the measure فَعِيلٌ is
أَزِيرٌ: (A:) ISd says, some hold that the و in وزير
is substituted for ء; but Abu-l-'Abbás says, that
this is not agreeable with analogy; for the substitution of ء for و in a word of this measure is
rare, and that of و for ء is more strange: (TA:)
the وزير is so called because he bears for the king
the burden of administration: (S, * Msb:) or it
is from ↓ وَزَرٌ, signifying “ a mountain to which
one has recourse to save himself from destruction: ” so the وزير of the khaleefeh is one upon
whose counsel the khaleefeh relies in his affairs,
and to whom he betakes himself for refuge or
safety: (Aboo-Is-hák, TA:) pl. وُزَرَآءُ (A, Msb,
K) and أَوْزَارٌ; (A, K;) the latter like أَشْرَافٌ and
أَيْتَامٌ, (A, TA,) pls. of شَرِيفٌ and يَتِيمٌ. (TA.)
وِزَارَةٌ and وَزَارَةٌ The condition, or office, of a
وَزِير: (S, Msb, K:) the former word is the more
approved. (ISk, Msb.)
وَازِرٌ Bearing, or carrying, a heavy load, or
burden. (A.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] also, (A,) and ↓ مَوْزُورٌ,
(S, A, Msb, K,) (tropical:)  Sinning: (S, A, K:) or bearing [a burden of] sin. (Msb.) مَأْزُورَاتٍ occurs
in a trad., for مَوْزُورَاتٍ, the regular form, because
it is there coupled with مَأْجُورَاتٍ, to which it is
opposed. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.)
مَوْزُورٌ: see وَازِرٌ.
وزع &c.
