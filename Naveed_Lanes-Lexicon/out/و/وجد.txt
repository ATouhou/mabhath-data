وجد1
وَجَدَهُ, aor. يَجِدُ and يَجُدُ, (S, L, Msb, K,)
the latter of the dial. of the tribe of 'Ámir (S, L,
Msb) Ibn-Saasa'ah, (MF,) and without a parallel
(S, L, Msb, K) in verbs of this class, (S, L, Msb,)
the و in it being dropped because it falls out in
the original form of the aor., (Msb,) both of
which forms are said by several authors to apply
to the verb in all its significations, though F
seems to restrict the latter to two significations,
(TA,) inf. n. وُجُودٌ (S, L, Msb, K) and وِجْدَان
(L, Msb, K,) and إِجْدَانٌ, (IAar, L, K,) in
which the و is changed into ء, (L,) and وَجْدٌ
and وُجْدٌ and جِدَةٌ; (L, K;) and وَجِدَهُ, aor.
يَجِدُ; (K;) but this form of the verb is not
found in the lexicons, [the K only accepted,]
(MF,) in the sense here assigned to it; (TA;)
He found it; lighted on it; attained it; obtained
it by searching or seeking; discovered it; perceived it; saw it; experienced it, or became
sensible of it; (F, in the K and in the Basáïr,
on the authority of Abu-l-Kásim El-Isbahánee;)
namely, a thing sought, sought for or after, or
desired; (S, L, K;) and simply a thing. (L.)
وُجُود is of several kinds. It is The finding, &c.,
by means of any one of the five senses: as when
one says وَجَدْتُ زَيْدًا [I found, &c., Zeyd]:
and وَجَدَتُ طَعْمَهُ, and رَائِحَتَهُ, and صَوْتَهُ, and
خُشُونَتَهُ, [I found, or perceived, &c., its taste,
and its odour, and its sound, and its roughness].
Also, The finding, &c., by means of the faculty
of appetite, [or rather of sensation, which is the
cause of appetite:] as when one says وَجَدْتُ
الشِّبَعَ [I found, experienced, or became sensible
of, satiety]. Also, The finding, &c., by the
intellect, or by means of the intellect: of which
kind is one's knowing God: and here it should
be observed, that وجود attributed to God is
simple knowledge: (Abu-l-Kásim El-Isbahánee,
cited in the Basáïr:) وَجَدَ اللّٰهُ, wherever it
occurs, means God knew. (Er-Rághib, Z, &c.)
i. e., in the Kur-án. (TA.) ―
-b2-  وَجَدَ [He found,
in the sense of] he knew [by experience]. (A,
TA, &c.) [In this sense, it is a verb of the
kind called أَفْعَالُ القُلُوبِ; having two objective
complements; the first of which is called its
noun, and the second its predicate.] Ex. وَجَدْتُ
زَيْدًا ذَا الحِفَاظِ I [found, or] knew Zeyd to
possess the quality of defending those things
which should be sacred, or inviolable. (A.)
Used in this sense, as doubly trans., its inf. n.
is وَجْدَانٌ (Akh) and وُجُودٌ. (Seer.) It is also
used as singly trans., as syn. with عَلِمَ. (TA.)
―
-b3-  When وَجَدَ signifies he found, or lighted on,
a thing after it had gone away, its inf. n. is
وِجْدَانٌ. (IKtt.) ―

aor. يَجِد (Msb) and يَجُدُ, (MF,) inf. n. وَجْدَانٌ
(S, Msb) and لَمْ أَجِدْ مِنْ ذٰلِكَ بُدًّا (Msb) [He found the stray
beast]. ―
-b5-  لَمْ أَجِدْ مِنْ ذٰلِكَ بُدًّا, for which one
also says لَمْ اجدِ, I found no means of avoiding,
or escaping, that. (Kz, TA.) ―
-b6-  وَجَدَ, (L,)
and وَجَدَ فِى المَالِ, (Fs, T, S, L, Msb,) and
وَجَدَ المَالَ وَغَيَرَهُ, (Lh, M, K,) aor. يَجِدُ, (Lh,
M, L, K,) inf. n. وُجْد and وِجد and وَجْدٌ- and

(Exps. of the Fs.) Hence the saying of the

possession of money hides the weakness of judgment of the weak in judgment]. (T, L.)
-A2-

and وِجْدَانٌ (Lh, S, M, L) and وُجُودٌ (Fr, Kzz)
