وعد1
وَعَدَ, aor. يَعِدُ, inf. n. وَعْدٌ and عِدَةٌ, (S, L,
Msb, K,) [in which the ة is a substitute for the
elided و,] or the latter is a quasi-inf. n., (L,)
and مَوْعِدٌ and مَوْعِدَةٌ, (L, Msb, K,) or the last
is a quasi-inf. n., (L,) and مَوْعُودٌ and مَوْعُودَةٌ,
(L, K,) the last two being instances of inf. ns.
of the measures مَفْعُولٌ and مَفْعوُلَةٌ, (L,) He
promised. (TA.) It is trans. immediately, and
by means of the prep. ب; (L, Msb, K;) but
some say that the ب is redundant in this case;
and most of the lexicologists disallow it with
this form of the verb, allowing it only with أَوْعَدَ.
(TA.) It is also used with reference to good
and evil: (S, L, Msb, K:) you say وَعَدَهُ خَيْرًا
[He promised him good]: and وَعَدَهُ شَرًّا (tropical:)  [He
threatened him with evil]: (Fr, Fs, S, L, Msb,
K, &c.:) and, [accord. to some,] وعده بِخَيْرٍ,
and بِشَرّ. (IKoot, Msb.) When neither good
nor evil is mentioned, if you mean the former,
you say وَعَدَ [He promised good]: and if you
mean the latter, ↓ أَوْعَدَ, (Fr, T, S, L, Msb, K,)
inf. n. إِيعَادٌ, with which وَعِيدٌ is syn., (S, L,
Msb, K,) being one irregular inf. n., [or quasiinf. n.,] (Msb,) [He threatened,] or threatened
with, evil]; and ↓ أَوْعَدَهُ [He threatened him,
menaced him, or threatened him with evil];
(Msb;) as also ↓ توعّدهُ, (L, Msb,) inf. n. تَوَعُّدٌ;
(S, L, K;) and ↓ اتّعدهُ. (L.) You also say
خَيْرًا ↓ اوعد [He promised good]; (IAar, T,
ISd, Msb, K;) but this is extr.: (L:) and
بِشَرٍّ ↓ اوعد [He threatened, or threatened with,
evil]: (S, L, Msb, K:) when ب is introduced
after this form of the verb, it relates only to
evil: (Fs, Msb:) but you also say شَرًّا ↓ اوعده.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  Failure of performance, with respect
to a promise, the Arabs regard as a lie; but
with regard to a threat, as generosity. A poet
says,
وَإِنِّى وَإِنْ أَوْعَدْتُهُ أَوْ وَعَدْتُهُ
لَمُخْلِفُ إِيعَادِى وَمُنْجِزُ مَوْعِدِى
[And verily I, if I threaten him or promise him,
fail to perform my threat, but fulfil my promise].
(Msb.) Nay, they do not apply the term خُلْفٌ
to the failure of performing a threat. (TA.) ―

in promising, and surpassed him therein, by promising more. (L, K. *) ―
-b3-  وَاعَدهُ الوقْتَ, and
المَوْضِعَ, [He appointed with him the time, and
the place]. (L, K.) أَوْعَدَنِى مَوْعِدًا is a vulgar
mistake. (Aboo-Bekr, L.)

أَوْعَدَ see 1 throughout.
-A2-  اوعد, (A, L,) inf. n.

تواعدوا and ↓ اتّعدوا signify the same,
[They promised one another]: (K *, TA:) or
the former relates to good, (S, Msb, K,) signifying they promised one another something good:
(S, Msb,) and the latter, to evil, (S, L, K,) signifying they threatened one another: (L:) and
this distinction is commonly admitted and observed. (TA.) ―

اتّعد, (A,) [aor. يَتَّعِدُ,] inf. n. إِتِّعَادٌ, (S, L,
K,) He accepted a promise: (S, A, L, K:)
originally إِوْتَعَدَ; the و being changed into ت
and then incorporated [into the augmentative
ت]: some persons say ائْتَعَدَ, aor. يَأْتَعِدُ, (inf. n.
ائْتِعَادٌ, TA) and pronounce the act. part. n.
مُؤْتَعِدٌ, with ء; (S, L, K;) like as they say
يَأْتَسِرُ: (S, L:) but [if they do not change the و
into ت] they should say إِيتَعَدَ, and يَاتَعِدُ, and
مُوتَعِدٌ, without
وَعُدَ. (IB, L.) ―
-b2-  Also, He confided in the promise of another. (L.) ―

of ↓ موعود, مَوَاعِيدُ. (L.) When عِدَة is used
as a prefixed n., [in a case of wasl,] the ة is
elided, (Fr, S, L,) and ى is substituted for it:
(Fr, L:) a poet says,
وَأَخْلَفُوكَ عِدَى الْأَمْرِ الَّذِى وَعَدُوا
[And they have broken to thee the promise of the
thing which they promised]. (Fr, S, L.) ―
-b2-
عَطِيَّةٌ ↓ العِدَةُ [A promise is equivalent to a gift]:
i. e., it is base to break it as it is to take back a
gift. A proverb. (TA.) ―
-b3-  الثريَّا ↓ وَعَدَهُ عِدَةَ
بِالقَمَرِ [He promised him as the moon promises
the Pleiades]: for the moon and the Pleiades
are in conjunction once in every month. Another
proverb. (TA.) [Perhaps we may also read
عِدَّةَ الثُّزَيَّا القَمَرَ: see مدَاد, in art. عد.] ―
-b4-
