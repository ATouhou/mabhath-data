ودأ1
وَدَأَهُ, aor. يَدَأُ, He made it even or plain.
(K.)
-A2-  See 5.
-A3-  ودأ (aor. يَدَأُ, T) Veretrum
exseruit equus: (T, K:) but AHeyth says that
this is an error, and that the correct word is
without ء: [i. e., وَدَى, q.v.]. (TA.)
-A4-  دَأْنِى
[imp.], i. q. دَعْنِى, Let me &c. (K.) Said by
some to be of weak authority. (TA.)
2
ودّأ عليه الأَرْضَ, inf. n. تَوْدِىْءٌ, He made
the earth even, or plain, over him. (AZ, S, K.)
―
-b2-  وَدَّأَتْهُ الأَرْضُ The earth, or the land, hid, or
concealed, him. (TA.) [See also 5.] ―
-b3-  ودّأ,
He, or it, buried. (IAar.) ―
-b4-  ودّأ بِهِمْ, inf. n.
تَوْدِئَةٌ; (S, L;) accord. to the K, وَدَأَ; but this
is incorrect; (TA;) He covered, or overwhelmed,
them with evil, or with ill treatment. (L, K.)

تودّاتُ عَلَيْهِ الأَرْضُ The earth became even,
or plain, over him, (K,) as over a dead body in
the grave: (TA:) or enclosed him: or was
overturned over him: or was broken in pieces
over him. (K.) ―
-b2-  The earth, or the land, hid,
or concealed, him. (TA.) [See also 2.] This
phrase is used when a person has gone away to
the more distant parts of the earth, or land,
so that it is not known what he has done: also,
when a man has died; even if among his family.
(ISh.) ―
-b3-  تودّأت عَنْهُ الأَخْبَارُ News, or tidings,
of him were cut off, or ceased to come; like
↓ وَدِئَتْ, and were hid. (K.) [In the K we
read, عنه الاخبارُ انقطعت [تودّأت] عليه و [تودّأت] و
الخ: whence it seems that تودّأت عليه الاخبار
also has the above signification. But in the
TA, after عليه, in the passage above quoted from
the K, is inserted الارض. This word, however,
has, I think, been inserted through inadvertence:
if not, تودّأت عليه الارضُ signifies The land was
interrupted to him, and hid: as also ↓ وَدِئَت.]
―
-b4-  تودّأ عَلَى مَالِهِ He took his property or wealth,
and kept it carefully. (K.)
-A2-  تودّأ عَلَيْهِ He,
or it, destroyed him. (S, K.)
وَدَأٌ Perdition; destruction. (K.)
مُوَدَّأٌ [Earth made even, or plain, over a person: or earth hiding, or concealing, him;] like
مُحْصَنٌ for مُحْصِنٌ, &c. (TA.) ―
-b2-  A grave.
(See below.) ―
-b3-  Zuheyr Ibn-Mes-ood Ed-Dabbee
says, in an elegy on his brother Ubeí,
أَ أُبَىُّ إِنْ تُصْبِحْ رَهِينَ مُوَدَّأٍ
زَلْجِ الجَوَانِبِ قَعْرُهُ مَلْحُودُ
[O Ubeí ! if thou become a deposit in a place
over which the earth is made even, or plain, (or
in a place that hideth thee, or in a grave,)
with smooth, or slippery, sides, and having its
bottom hollowed out laterally, ―
-b4- ] (S, TA. See
Ham, p. 466.) ―
-b5-  مُوَدَّأَةٌ A place of destruction,
or perdition; or a desert in which is no water.
(AA, S, K.) ―
-b6-  Also, accord. to IAar, or without ة, as in an example which he quotes, A
grave. (TA.)
