وبأ1
وَبِئَتِ الأَرْضُ, (S, K,) aor. تِيبَأُ, (K, TA,)
or تَيْبَأُ, (CK,) and تَوْبَأُ, (accord. to the K: in
the (S and) L and other lexicons, only this last aor.
is mentioned; but it is asserted on the authority
of AZ, who says that this form of the pret. is of the
dial. of the Kusheyrees, that the aor. is تِيبَا, with
kesr to the ت, [contr. to analogy,] TA,) inf. n. وَبَأٌ;
(K;) or وَبَآءَةٌ; (S;) and وَبِيَت, aor. تَيْبَا and تَوْبَا;
(Moo'ab and Jámi') and وَبُؤَت, inf. n. وَبَآءٌ and
وَبَآءَةٌ and أَبَآ and أَبَآةٌ (K, the و being changed
into أ in the latter two); and with و without
وَبُاَ,
[i. e., وَبُوَت]; (Moo'ab and Jámi'] and وُبِئَت,
(S, K,) like عُنِىَ, [i. e., pass. in form, but neut.
in signification,] (K,) aor. تِيبَأُ, (L and other
lexicons,) in which, the و being changed into ى,
the vowel of the first letter necessarily becomes
kesr, (TA,) or تُوبَأُ, (S,) inf. n. وَبْءٌ, (K, TA:
in the CK وَبَأٌ,) or وَبَآءٌ; (S, L, &c.;) and ↓ أَوْبَأَت,
(S, K,) inf. n. إِيبَآءٌ; (TA;) The land was,
or became, afflicted with وَبَأ: (K:) or, much
afflicted with disease. (S.)
-A2-  وَبَأَ, aor. يَوْبَأُ;
(K; contr. to rule, which requires that the
aor. should be يَبَا; MF;) and ↓ وبّأ; He
put the utensils, or goods, one upon another;
or packed them up: or he prepared, set in
order, or arranged, them; syn. عَبَأَ. (K.)
-A3-  وَبَأَ إِلَيْهِ; (S, K: Ibn-El-Mukarram says, I
think that Th has mentioned وَبَأْتُ, without tesh-deed; but I am not confident of it; TA;) and
↓ اوبأ, inf. n. إِيْبَآءٌ; (S, K;) dial. vars. of وَمَأَ
and أَوْمَأَ; (S;) He made a sign to him: (S, K:)
or اوبأ اليه signifies he made a sign to him
with his fingers, forwards, that he should
approach; and اومأ اليه “ he made a sign to him
with his fingers, backwards, that he should retire,
or remain behind. ” So accord. to the K; but
this is at variance with what the leading lexicographers have transmitted. In the L it is said,
وبأ اليه and اوبأ are dial. syns. of ومأ and اومأ
he made a sign to him: or, accord. to some, اومأ
اليه signifies “ he made a sign with his hand to
him, (i. e., to a person before him,) turning his
fingers towards the palm of his hand, in order
that he should approach him; ” [in doing which,
the palm of the hand is held towards the person
beckoned;] and ↓ اوبا أليه he made a sign
to him; (i. e., to a person behind him,) opening
his fingers [from the palm] towards the back
of the hand, in order that he should retire,
or remain behind; [in doing which, the palm
of his hand is towards himself]. El-Ferezdak
says,
تَرَى النَّاسَ إِنْ سِرْنَا يَسِيرُونَ خَلْفَنَا
النَّاسِ وَقَّفُوا ↓ وَإِنْ نَحْنُ وَبَّأْنَا إِلَى
[If we journey on, thou seest the people journey
on behind us; and if we make a sign to the
people to remain behind, they stop, one after
another]. ↓ أَوْبَأْنَا is also read in this verse for
وَبَّأْنَا. Ibn-Buzruj says, that اومأ signifies “ he
made a sign with the eyebrows, and the eyes; ”
and ↓ وبّأ, he made a sign with the hands, and a
garment, and the head. (TA.) ―
-b2-  وَبَأَتْ إِلَيْهِ, aor.

استوبا (S, K,) and ↓ توبّأ (TA) He found,
or deemed, a country, (S, K,) or water, (TA,)
unhealthy, or unwholesome: (K, TA:) [see وَبَأٌ:]
or, much afflicted with disease. (S.)
وَبَأٌ and ↓ وَبَآءٌ, (S, K,) and also without
وَبُاَ,
[وَبًا,] (TA,) Plague, or pestilence; syn.
طَاعُونٌ: (K:) or a common, or general, [or
an epidemic,] disease: (S:) or any such
disease: (K:) or a quickness, and commonness, of death among men. (TA.) Accord.
to Ibn-En-Nefees, it is a corruption happening to the substance of the air, by reason
of causes in the heavens or the earth; as
stinking water, and carcases, such as are the
result of bloody battles. Accord. to the hakeem
Dá-ood, it is a change effected in the air by
events in the higher regions, as the conjunction of
beaming stars; and by events in the lower
regions, as bloody battles, and the opening of
graves, and the ascending of putrid exhalations;
with which causes conspire the changes of the
seasons and elements, and the revolutions of the
universe. They mention also its signs; among
which are fever, small-pox, defluxions, itch or
scab, tumours, &c. What is said in the Nuzheh
necessarily implies that the طاعون is one of
the different kinds of وبا; as the physicians
hold to be the case: but the opinion which the
critics among the professors of practical law and
the relaters of traditions hold is, that these two
diseases are distinct, the one from the other; the
وبا being an unwholesomeness in the air, in consequence of which diseases become common among
men; and the طاعون being that kind [of disease]
with which men are smitten by the jinn, or genii:
an opinion which they corroborate by the words
in a trad. إِنَّهُ وَحْزُ أَعْدَائِكُمْ مِنَ الجِنِّ [Verily it
is the unpenetrating thrusting of your enemies
among the jinn]. (TA.) The pl. of وَبَأٌ is أَوْبَآءُ;
and of ↓ أَوْبِيَةٌ, وَبَآءٌ (S, K, TA) or أَوْبِئَةٌ. (CK.)
بِئَةٌ The state of a land being afflicted with
وَبَأ. (K.)
أَرْضٌ وَبِئَةٌ, and ↓ وَبِيْئَةٌ, (S, K,) and ↓ مَوْبُوْءَةٌ,
(S, L,) and مُوبِئَةٌ, (S, K,) a land much, or often,
afflicted with وَبَأ: (K:) or, much afflicted with
disease. (S.)

-b2-  جُرْعَةَ شَرُوبٍ
أَنْفَعُ مِنْ عَذْبٍ مُوبٍ A draught of brackish water
is more profitable than sweet water that engenders
وَبَأ. (A trad.) Here the
وَبُاَ is omitted in the last
word to assimilate it to شروب. It is a proverb,
applied to two men; one, superior in station,
and more slim; the other, inferior in station, but
more useful. (TA.) ―
