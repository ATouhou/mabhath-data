ولب1
وَلَبَ, aor. يَلِبُ, inf. n. وُلُوبٌ, He entered
(K) into a house or tent, or into a tract, or
quarter, or the like. (TA.) ―

-b3-  وَلَبَ إِلَيْكَ الشَّىْءُ,
aor. يَلِبُ, inf. n. وُلُوبٌ, The thing, of whatever
kind it was, came to thee, or reached thee.
(A'Obeyd, S.) In the copies of the K, وَلَبَ
الشَّىْءَ وإِلَيْكَ; accord. to which, the verb, in the
sense of وَصَلَ, there assigned to it, is trans.
both immediately and by means of إِلَى: but
the correct reading is ولب اليكالشىء, as above.
In an old, and generally correct, copy of the
Tahdheeb el-Af'ál of IKtt, it is said that
ولب اليك الشَّرُّ signifies The evil reached thee:
syn. تَوَصَّلَ. (TA.) ―

وَلْبٌ, It (corn or the like) germinated in offsets
around the older plants. (IKtt.) ―
-b5-  وَلَبَ بنو
فُلَانٍ The sons of such a one multiplied, or
increased. (IKtt.)
وَالِبٌ, Going into a thing; entering into it.
(Esh-Sheybánee, S.)
وَالِبَةٌ The offsets of the corn and the like:
(K:) so called because they enter into the roots
of the parent-plants: (TA:) or corn or the like
growing from the roots of that which has preceded it: (S:) pl. أَوَالِبُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  وَالِبَةٌ The
offspring of camels, (IAar, S,) and of sheep or
goats, (IAar, K,) and of cows, (K,) and of a
people. (IAar.)
تَوْلَبُ: see art. تلب. Accord. to Suh, the ت
is substituted for و, and the word is derived
from والية, the “ offsets of corn and the like: ”
and Ibn-'Osfoor and IKtt assert the same.
(TA.)
