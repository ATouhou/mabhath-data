وهب1
وَهَبَ لَهُ شَيْئًا, (aor. يَهَبُ, K; said to be
originally يَوْهِبُ; which is changed into يَهِبُ
because of the kesr; and then, into يَهَبُ because
of the medial guttural letter; Msb, voce وَسِعَ;)
inf. n. وَهْبٌ and وَهَبٌ and هِبَةٌ (S, K) and مَوْهِبٌ
and مَوْهِبَةٌ, (Msb,) or the last two are substs.,
(S, K, &c.) He gave him a thing; properly, as
a free gift, disinterestedly, and not for any
compensation. (Msb, TA.) You should not
say وَهَبَكَهُ [he gave it to thee], (K, &c.,) making
the verb doubly trans.: (TA:) or [this is
allowable, as it is said that] AA has related this
on the authority of an Arab of the desert: so in
the K: but in the L, it is said that Seer has
related this, from 'Amr, (meaning Sb,) from an
Arab of the desert. (TA.) En-Nawawee allows
the expression وَهَبُتُ كَذَا مِنْهُ, meaning, I gave
such a thing to him, &c.; (من being redundant,
as in بِعْتُ كَذَا مِنْهُ “ I sold such a thing to
him; ”) as occurring in several trads. (MF.) ―
-b2-
See 3. ―
-b3-  وَهَبَنِىاللّٰهُ فِدَاكَ May God make me
[or give me as] thy ransom! (IAar, K.)
وُهِبْتُ فِدَاكَ May I be made [or given as] thy
ransom! Ibn-Umm-Kásim says, that وهب is
one of the verbs which signify He caused to be,
or to become: and he cites the above phrase
from IAar; and adds, that the verb is only used
in the pret. tense. Others assert it to be rare.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  هَبْنِى فَعَلْتُ ذٰلِكَ Suppose me; syn.
ظُنَّنِى; (AHei, cited by Fei;) or count me, or
reckon me; syn. أُحْسُبْنِى وَاعْدُدْنِى; (M, K;)
[or grant me;] to have done that. (M, K. *)
هَبْ زَيْدًا مَنْطَلِقًا Suppose Zeyd to be going away,
or gone away; syn. إِحْسَبْ. (So in two copies
of the S: in another, أُحْسُبْ.) Thus this verb is
doubly trans.: (S:) but it is not used in this
sense in the pret., nor in the aor.: (S, K:) you
do not say وَهَبْتُكَ فَعَلْتَ ذٰلِكَ [I supposed thee to
have done that]: nor (as some assert, Msb,) do
you say هَبْ أَنِّى فَعَلْتُ, (TA,) as say the vulgar,
though what the grammarians say, respecting
the class of verbs to which ظَنَنْتُ belongs, that
أَنَّ and إِنَّ [with what follows them] may supply
the place of the two objective complements, [as
when you say ظَنَنْتُ أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ, and ظننت إِنَّ
زَيْدًا لَقَائِمٌ, “I thought Zeyd to be standing,”]
affords matter for controverting this. (Msb.)

وَاْهَبَ ↓ وَاهَبَهُ فَوَهَبَهُ, aor. of the latter verb يَهَبُ
and يَهِبُ, He strove to surpass him in giving,
freely, or disinterestedly, and he surpassed him
therein. (K.) [The former of the above aors.,
accord. to general opinion, is irregular; and the
latter, regular; because the first radical letter is
و; as in the case of وَاعَدَهُ فَوَعَدَهُ, aor. يَعِدُ:
or, accord. to the rule laid down by Ks, the
reverse is perhaps the case, because the medial
radical letter is a guttural. See Lumsden's Ar.
Gram., p. 171.]

اوهب لَهُ الشَّىْءَ He prepared, or made
ready, the thing for him. (K.) ―
-b2-  أَوْهَبْتُكَ الطَّعَامَ
وَالشَّرَابَ I prepared, or made ready, for thee the
food and beverage, and abundance of them.
(Tahdheeb el-Af'ál.) But see this verb in an
intrans. sense. ―
-b3-  أَوْهَبَ الطَّعَامُ (tropical:)  The food, or
corn, or the like, became abundant and ample, so
that some of it was given away. (A.)
-A2-  أَوْهَبْتُ
لِأَمْرِ كَذَا (tropical:)  I became capable of such a thing
and able to do it. (A.) ―
-b2-  أَوْهَبَ لَكَ الشَّىْءُ The
thing was, or became, within thy power, or reach,
so that thou mightest take it. (K. *) Related on
the authority of IAar alone, who says, They
did not say أَوْهَبْتُهُ لَكَ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  أَوْهَبَ لَهُ الشَّىْءُ
The thing was lasting to him. (A'Obeyd, AZ,
S, K.) J cites the following verse:
عَظِيمُ القَفَا رِخْوُ الخَوَاصِرِ أَوْهَبَتْ
لَهُ عَجْوَةٌ مَسْمُونَةٌ وَخَمِيرُ
[Large in the back of the neck, soft (or loose or
flabby) in the flanks: dates of the best that ElMedeeneh produces, prepared with clarified butter,
and leaven, are lasting (provisions) to him].
But 'Alee Ibn-Hamzeh says, that this is a mistake, and that the right reading is أُرْهِنَتْ,
meaning “ are prepared, and continued. ” So in
a marginal note in a copy of the S. (TA.) [So
too in the margin of one of my MS. copies
of the S.]

do not give by constraint. (TA, from a trad.)

first signifies Giving; properly, as a free gift,
disinterestedly; and not for any compensation:
or one who gives; &c.:] the others are intensive
epithets, [as is said in the S of the third and
fourth,] signifying one who gives liberally, or
bountifully; &c.: and in this sense ↓ الوَهَّابُ is
used as an epithet of God; or, accord. to the
Nh, it signifies He who dispenses his bounties
universally and perpetually, freely, or without
constraint, and disinterestedly, for no compensation. The ة in ↓ وهّابة is added to give more
force to the intensiveness; as in عَلَّامَةٌ. (TA.)
