وصروِصْرٌ A covenant, compact, or contract: (S,
K:) a dial. form of إِصْرٌ; like as they said إِرْثٌ
and وِرْثٌ, and إِسَادَةٌ and وِسَادَةٌ. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also,
(S, A, K,) and ↓ وَصَرَّةٌ (Lth, A, K) and ↓ وَصِيرَةٌ (K)
and ↓ أَوْصَرٌ, (Lth, TS, L,) A written statement of
a purchase or sale, transfer, bargain, or contract:
(S, A, K, TA:) the first is from إِصْرٌ, and is
generally used in this sense: pl. of the first,
أَوْصَارٌ; and of the second, وَصَرَّاتٌ: Lth says,
that the second is an arabicized word; and
others say, that the first and second are Persian
words, arabicized. (TA.) One says, أَقْطَعَهُ
الأَرْضَ وَكَتَبَ لَهُ الوِصْرَ, and ↓ الوَصَرَّةَ, [He made
him a grant of the land to be held in fee, and
wrote for him the statement of the transfer.] (A.)
And it is said in a trad., هٰذَا اشْتَرَى مِنِّى أَرْضًا
وَقَبَضَ مِنِّى وِصْرَهَا فَلَا هُوَ يَرُدُّ عَلَىَّ الوِصْرَ وَلَا
يُعْطِينِى الثَّمَنَ [This man purchased of me some
land (or دَارًا a house, as in the TA) and received
of me the written statement of its sale, but he will
not restore to me the written statement of the sale,
nor will he give me the price]. (S.)
