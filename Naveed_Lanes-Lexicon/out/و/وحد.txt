وَحَدَ, aor. يَحِدُ; (T, L, Msb;) and وَحِدَ,
(Lh, M, L, K,) aor. يَوْحَدُ (Lh) and يَحِدُ; (K;)
with the latter aor., like وَرِثَ, aor. يَرِثُ; but وَحِدَ
with this aor. is not mentioned by the lexicologists or grammarians [except F]; (MF;) [and
its aor. is therefore probably يَوْحَدُ, only, agreeably with analogy, for which reason it seems to
be omitted in the M;] and وَحُدَ, (Lh, M, L,
Msb, K,) aor. also يَحِدُ; (K;) but this is
without a parallel, and without any authority
[except F]; (MF;) or يَوْحَدُ; (L;) [but this is
also extr., and is probably a mistake for يَوْحُدُ,
which is the form agreeable with analogy;]
inf. n. حِدَةٌ (T, M, L, Msb, K) and وَحْدٌ (M,
L, K) and وَحَدٌ (L) and وَحْدَةٌ, (L, K,) or
وُحْدَةٌ, (as in some copies of the K and in the
TA) and وُحُودٌ (K) and وَحَادَةٌ (M, L, Msb, K)
and وُحُودَةٌ; (K;) He, or it, was, or became,
alone, by himself or itself, apart from others;
(T, L, Msb;) as also [↓ إِتَّحَدَ; and ↓ توحّد;
and] ↓ استوحد; (A:) he was, or became, alone,
without anyone to cheer him by his society, company, or conversation: (L:) he remained alone,
by himself, apart from others; (Lh, M, L,
K;) as also ↓ توحّد. (M, L, K.) See also 5,

وحّدهُ, (inf. n. تَوْحِيدٌ, K,) He made it one;
or called it one: (K:) like as one says ثَنَاهُ, and
ثَلَّثَهُ: (S, L:) as also أَحَّدَهُ. (TA.) Similar
verbs are formed from the other nouns significant of numbers, to عَشَرَةٌ. (Esh-Sheybánee,
K.) ―
-b2-  وحّد لِامْرَأَتِهِ, or عِنْدَهَا, He remained one
night with his wife: and in like manner the verb
is used in relation to any saying or action.
(TA, voce سَبَّعَ.) ―
-b3-  وحّد اللّٰهَ, inf. n. تَوْحِيدٌ, He
asserted, or declared, God to be one: he asserted,
declared, or preferred belief in, the unity of God:
as also احّدهُ. (T, L.) ―
-b4-  التَّوْحِيدُ The belief in
God alone; (L, K;) in his unity. (L.)

him alone, or by himself. (L.) ―
-b5-  أَوْحَدْتُهُ بِرُؤْيَتِى,
inf. n. إِيحَادٌ, [I singled him by my sight;] I
saw none save him. (S, L.) ―
-b6-  اوحدت She
(a ewe) brought forth one only: (S, K:) like
أَفَذَّتْ. (S.) ―
-b7-  اوحدت بِهِ She (a woman)
brought him forth an unequalled one. (L, from

حِدَةٌ: see وَحْدٌ. ―
-b2-  فَعَلَهُ مِنْ ذَاتِ حِدَتِهِ, and
عَلَى ذات حدته, and من ذِى حدته, and من
ذات نَفْسِهِ, and من ذات رَأْيِهِ, He did it of himself; of his own accord; of his own judgment.
(AZ, L, K.)
وَحْدٌ: see 1, and وَحِيدٌ. ―
-b2-  رَأَيْتُهُ وَحْدَهُ
(S, L, K) I saw him alone. (S, L.) وحد is
here an inf. n., having no dual nor pl. (K.)
The Koofees hold it to be in the acc. case as
an adv. n. of place: the Basrees, as an inf. n.,
in every instance; as though thou saidst أَوْحَدْتُهُ
بِرُؤْيَتِى إِبحَادًا, meaning “ I saw none save him,”
and then substituted وحده: or, as Abu-l-'Abbás
says, it may mean the man's being himself
alone; as though thou saidst رَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا مُنْفَرِدًا
اِنْفِرَادًا, and then substituted وحده. (S.) Or
it is in the acc. case as a denotative of state
accord. to the Basrees [and the grammarians in
general]; not as an inf. n., J being in error in
what he says on this matter: (IB, K:) the
Basrees hold it to be a noun occupying the
place of an inf. n. in the acc. case as a denotative
of state; like جَآءَ زَيْدٌ رَكْضًا, meaning رَاكِضًا:
(IB:) excepting some of them, as Yoo, who
holds it to be in the acc. case as an adv. n. of
place, for عَلَى وَحْدِهِ, (IB, K,) like عِنْدَهُ: (TA:)
and there is a third opinion, that of Hishám;
that it is in the acc. case as an inf. n. (L.) Or,
(accord. to IAar, L,) it is a noun used as a
noun absolutely: (L, K:) so in the dial. of the
Benoo-Temeem: (Msb:) you say جَلَسَ وَحْدَهُ,
and عَلَى وَحْدِهِ, and جَلَسَا عَلَى وَحْدِ هِمَا, and
وَحْدَيْهِمَا, and جَلَسُوا عَلَى وَحْدِهِمْ, [He sat
alone, and they two sat alone, and they sat
alone]. (L, K.) When not preceded by a prefixed n. [or a prep.], it is always in the acc.
case: (Lth, L:) you say, لَا إِلَاَه إِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَحْدَهُ
[There is no deity but God alone]: and مَرَرْتُ
بِزَيْدٍ وَحْدَهُ [I passed by Zeyd alone]: (L:)
[excepting in a few cases, such as the phrases]
قُلْنَا هٰذَا الأَمْرَ وَحْدَيْنَا [We two alone said this
thing], and قَالَتَاهُ وَحْدَيْهُمَا [They two women
alone said it]; mentioned by AZ. (L.) You
say also, هٰذَا عَلَى وَحْدِهِ, and ↓ عَلَى حِدَتِهِ, This
is by itself; (L, K;) and هُمَا عَلَى حِدَتِهِمَا They
two are by themselves: and هُمْ عَلَى حِدَتِهِمْ
They are by themselves: (L:) and أَعْطِ كُلَّ وَاحِدٍ
مَنْهُمْ عَلَى حِدَتِهِ Give thou to every one of them
by himself; syn. على حِيَالِهِ. (S.) The ة in حِدَةٌ
is a substitute for the و (S, L) which is cut off
from the beginning. (L.) ―
-b3-  وَحْدٌ, (K,) or
↓ وَحَدٌ, (L,) A wild animal alone, by itself, or
apart from others. (L, K.) ―
-b4-  وَحَدٌ, (K,) or
↓ وَحَدٌ, (L,) A man whose lineage and origin are
unknown. (Lth, L, K.) ―
-b5-  وَحْد is used as the
complement of a prefixed n. only in the following phrases: (A'Obeyd, S, L:) هُوَ نَسِيجُ وَحْدِهِ,
which is an expression of praise; (S, L, K;)
meaning, (tropical:)  He is one unequalled; one who has
no second: (L:) or he is a man of right judgment: you say also هُمَا نَسِيجَا وَحْدِهِمَا, and
هُمْ نُسَجَآءُ وَحْدِهِمْ, and هِىَ نَسِيجَةُ وَحْدِهَا, and
هُنَّ نَسَائِجُ وَحْدِهِنَّ: (Lth, L:) [see art. نسج:]
it is as though you said نَسِيجُ إِفْرَادٍ: you put
وحده in the place of an inf. n. in the gen. case:
(S:) and رَجُلُ وَحْدِهِ, (IAar, L,) and رُجَيْلُ وَحْدِهِ,
(S, L,) [A man unequalled; who has no second,
and a little man (probably meaning the contr.)
&c.]: and قَرِيعُ وَحْدِهِ A man with whom no one
contends in excellence: (Lth, L:) and عُيَيْرُ وَحْدِهِ,
and جُحَيْشُ وَحْدِهِ, which are expressions of
dispraise; (S, L, K;) meaning, (tropical:)  One who does
not consult, nor mix with, any one, and who is
contemptible and weak: (Sh, L:) وَحْد being
used in the manner of an inf. n., not being an
epithet nor an enunciative so as to be in concordance with the preceding noun, would be
more properly in the acc. case; but the Arabs
use it in these instances as the complement of a
prefixed n.: (Lth, L:) these expressions are
indeterminate: for the Arabs say, رُبَّ نَسِيجِ وَحْدِهِ
قَدْ رَأَيْتُ (tropical:)  [Few unequalled men have I seen].
(Hishám, Fr., L.)
وَحَدٌ: see وَحْدٌ and وَحِيدٌ.
وَحِدٌ: see وَحِيدٌ.
وَحْدَةٌ The state of being alone, or apart from
others; solitariness; solitude. (Sb, S.) See 1.
―
-b2-  وَحْدَةُ القَبْرِ [The solitude of the grave]. (A.)
―
-b3-  [لَيْلَةُ الوَحْدَةِ The night of solitude; the first
night after burial: so called because the soul is
believed to remain in the grave during this
night, and then to depart to the place appointed
for the residence of good souls until the last day,
or to the appointed prison in which wicked souls
await their final doom. See also لَيْلَةٌ الوَحْشَةِ.]
وَحْدَانِيَّةٌ The unity of God: (L, K: *) as
also أَحْدِيَّةٌ. (Msb.)
وَحْدَانِيٌّ One who is singular in his religious
opinions; who separates himself from the general
body of believers: a rel. n. from الوَحْدَةُ; the
ا and ن being added to give intensiveness to the
signification. (L.)
وُحَادَ: see مَوْحَدَ.
وَحِيدٌ (S, L, Msb, K) and ↓ مُتَوَحِّدٌ (L, K)
and ↓ وَحَدٌ and ↓ وَحِدٌ (S, L, Msb, K) and ↓ وَحْدٌ
(M, L) and ↓ وَاحِدٌ (L) A man alone; by himself; apart from others; solitary; lonely: (S,
M, L, Msb, K;) as also أَحَدٌ: (M, L, K:) or,
accord. to Az, one should not say رَجُلٌ أَحَدٌ,
nor دِرْهَمٌ أَحَدٌ, nor شَىْءٌ أَحَدٌ, though some of
the lexicologists assert that أَحَدٌ is originally
وَحَدٌ: for أَحَدٌ is an epithet applied to God
alone: (L:) the fem. epithet used in this sense is
وَحِدَةٌ: (K:) and ↓ وَاحِدٌ in this sense receives
the dual form: and the pl. is وُحْدَانٌ and أَحْدَانٌ
and وِحَادٌ. (L.) رَجُلٌ وَحِيدٌ A man who has
no one to cheer him by his society, conversation,
or company. And ↓ رَجُلٌ مُتَوَحِّدٌ A man who
remains alone, by himself, apart from others,
or solitary, not mixing with other people, not
sitting with them. (L.) See also وَحْدٌ.
وَاحِدٌ One; the first of the numbers: (S, L,
Msb, K:) syn. [in many cases, which will be
shown below,] with أَحَدٌ: (K:) [and one alone:
a single person or thing:] fem. وَاحِدَةٌ: (L,
Msb:) it sometimes receives the dual form;
(L, K;) as in the expression إِلْتَقَيْنَا وَاحِدَيْنِ
[We met, we being each of us one alone]; cited
from a poet by IAar: or the dual form pertains
to it in another sense, explained below, namely
“ alone: ” (L:) pl. وَاحِدُونَ (S, L, K) and
وُحْدَانٌ and أُحْدَانٌ; (S, L;) in the last of
which, أ is substituted for و because of the
dammeh: (L:) one says, أَنْتُمْ حَىٌّ وَاحِدٌ, and
حَىٌّ وَاحِدُونَ, (Ye are one tribe, L) like as one
says شِرْذِمَةٌ قَلِيلُونَ: (Fr, S, L:) آحَادٌ may also
be a pl. of وَاحِدٌ [and therefore originally أَوْحَادٌ,]
like as أَشْهَادٌ is pl. of شَاهِدٌ. (Th, Msb.) Its
proper signification is A thing having no subdivision: and it is secondarily applied to any
existing thing; so that there is no number to
which it may not be applied as an epithet;
wherefore one says, عَشَرَةٌ وَاحِدَةٌ [One ten], and
مِائَةٌ وَاحِدَةٌ [One hundred]. (Er-Rághib.) It
is interchangeable for أَحَدٌ when used as an
epithet applied to God; and in certain nouns
of number. [See art. أحد.] In most cases
differing from these two, there is a difference in
usage. The latter is used in affirmative phrases
as a prefixed noun only, governing the noun
which follows it in the gen. case; and is used
absolutely in negative phrases: whereas the
former is used in affirmative phrases as a prefixed
n. and otherwise. (Msb.) [See, again, art.
أَحد.] ―
-b2-  ↓ لَسْتُ فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ بأَوِْحَدَ I am not
alone, without a parallel, or watch, in this
affair: (S, * L, K: *) or simply, I am not alone
in it. (T, L.) The fem. وَحْدَآءُ is not used.
(S, L.) ―
-b3-  أُحْدَانٌ, the pl. of ↓ اوحد, is applied
by a poet to dogs having no equals or matches.
(S, L.) ―
-b4-  فُلَانٌ لَا وَاحِدَ لَهُ Such a one has no
equal, like, parallel, or match. (S, M, L.) ―
-b5-
Also, One that has no equal; one unequalled.
(L.) ―
-b6-  فُلَانٌ وَاحِدُ دَهْرِهِ Such a person is the
unequalled one of his age. (S, L.) And in like
manner, (TA,) أَهْلِ زَمَانِهِ ↓ فُلَانٌ أَوْحَدُ (S, L)
Such a person is the unequalled one of the people
of his time. (TA.) The pl. of ↓ اوحد [as well
as of واحد in the same sense] is أُحْدَانٌ,
(originally وُحْدَانٌ, S) like as سُودَانٌ is pl. أَسْوَدُ.
(S, L.) ―
-b7-  وَاحِدُ أُمِّهِ [An unequalled son of his
mother], is an indeterminate expression, like
نَسِيجُ وَحْدِهِ, q. v. (Hishám, Fr. L.) ―
-b8-  Also,
A man pre-eminent in knowledge or science, or in
valour in war, (L, K [in the CK, for بَأْس is put
ناس]) or in other qualities; as though having
no equal, and thus being alone: (L:) pl.
وُحْدَانٌ and أُحْدانٌ. (L, K.) ―
-b9-  الوَاحِدُ and
الأَحَدُ (T, L) and ↓ الأَوْحَدُ and ↓ المُتَوَحِّدُ, (M,
L, K,) epithets applied to God, The One, the
Sole; He whose attribute is unity: (M, L, K:)
or the first signifies the One in essence, who has
no like nor equal; and the second, the One in
attributes, beside whom there is no other: or
the first, the One who is not susceptible of division
into parts or portions, nor of duplication, and
who has no equal nor like: (TL:) or the One
who has ever been alone, without companion:
(IAth, L:) and there is no being but God to
whom the first and second of these epithets are
applicable together, or to whom the second is
applicable alone. (T, L.) See also أَحَدٌ, in art.
أحد. ―
-b10-  الإِنْسَانُ وَالفَرَسُ وَاحِدٌ فِى الجِنْسِ The
human being and the horse are one in genus.
And زَيْد وَعَمرْوٌ وَاحِدٌ فِى النَّوْعِ Zeyd and 'Amr
are one in species. (Er-Rághib.) ―
-b11-  وَاحِدٌ Singular, as opposed to plural: pl. وُحْدَانٌ. (The
lexicons, passim.) ―
-b12-  أَصْحَابِى وَأَصْحَابُكَ وَاحِدٌ
[Thy companions and my companions are one
and the same]. And الجُلُوسُ وَالقُعُود وَاحِدٌ
[الجلوس and القعود are one and the same].
(L.) ―
-b13-  See وَحِيدٌ. ―
-b14-  حَادِىَ عَشَرَ, masc., and
حَادِيَةَ عَشْرَةَ, fem., Eleventh. In this case, [and
in similar instances, as حَادِى وَعِشْرُونَ Twentyfirst, &c.,] حادى and حادية are formed by transposition from وَاحِدٌ and وَاحِدَةٌ, by putting the
first radical letter after the second. [When
without the article, it is indecl.: but when rendered determinate by the article, the first word
is decl.] You say, هُوَ حَادِىَ عَشَرَهُمْ [He is the
eleventh of them]: and اليَوْمُ الحَادِى عَشَرَ [The
eleventh day]: and اللَّيْلَةُ الحَادِيَةُ عَشْرَةَ [The
eleventh night]. (ISd, L.) [The rules respecting حَادِىَ عَشَرَ and its fem. are the same as those
respecting ثَالِثَ عَشَرَ and its fem., explained in
art. ثلث, q. v.] ―
-b15-  بِوَاحِدَةٍ signifies i. q. فَقَطْ:
and is often used in the sense of البَتَّةَ. (MF,
voce ذُرُّوحٌ.)
إِحْدَى: see art. أحد.
أُحَادَ: see مُوْحَدَ.
أَوْحَدُ: see وَاحِدٌ.
مُوحِدٌ A ewe bringing forth, or that brings
forth, one ewe only. (S, K.) [See مُغْرِدٌ.]
مَوْحَدَ and ↓ وُحَادَ and أُحَادَ [used adverbially]
are imperfectly decl. because of their having the
quality of an epithet and deviating from their
original form, (S, L,) which is وَاحِدًا: (L, K:)
or because they differ from their original both as
to the letter and the meaning; the original word
being changed as above stated, and the meaning
being changed to وَاحِدًا وَاحِدًا: (S, L:) you say
دَخَلُوا مَوْحَدَ مَوْحَدَ, (S, L, K,) [and وُحَادَ وُحَادَ,]
and أُحَادَ أُحَادَ, (L, K,) They entered one [and]
one, [one and one]; or one [by] one, [one by
one]; (K;) or one at a time; one after another.
(S, L.)
[
مُوَحَّدَةٌ, (not مُوحَدَةٌ,) conv. term in lexicology, Having one diacritical point; one-pointed:
an epithet added to باء to prevent its being
mistaken for تاء, ثاء, or ياء. (The lexicons,
passim.)]
مِيحَادٌ One of several hills, such as are called
أَكَمَات, separate or remote, one from another:
pl. مَوَاحِيدُ. (L, K.) F remarks, that J is in
error in saying, المِيحَادُ مِنَ الوَاحِدِ كَالمِعْشَارِ مِنَ
العَشَرَةِ: (TA:) but the meaning of this is, that
it denotes one part or portion; like as مِعْشَارٌ
signifies one of ten: (L:) [i. e., the former signifies one of several things whereof each is
alone, or by itself:] and the same explanation
is given by [several] old authors. (TA.) [In
one copy of the S, instead of العَشَرَة, I find العُشْر;
which affords a good sense, i. e., that ميحاد, is
syn. with وَاحِدٌ; and may be the true reading.]
