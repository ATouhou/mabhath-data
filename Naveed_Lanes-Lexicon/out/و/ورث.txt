ورث1
وَرِثَ, aor. يَرِثُ, (S, K,) an instance of
deviation from a constant rule, there being only
the following verbs of the measure فَعِلَ which
have the aorists of the measure يَفْعِلُ only,
namely, وَثِقَ, وَرِثَ, وَرِعَ, وَرِمَ, وَرِىَ, وَفِقَ, وَلِىَ,
and وَمِقَ, (Ibn-Málik and others,) and وَصِبَ:
(TA, art. وَصب:) the و falls out in يَرِثُ [&c.]
because it occurs between ى and kesreh; and in
those persons of the aor. which begin with ا and
ت and ن because these letters are changed from
ى, which is the original: (S:) inf. n. وِرْثٌ and
إِرْثٌ, (S, K,) in which the و is changed into أ,
(S,) and رِثَةٌ, (S, K,) in which the ة is a substitute for the [elided] و, (S,) and وِرَاثَةٌ (S, K,)
[the most common form] and إِرَاثَةٌ, (TA,) and
accord. to some مِيرَاثٌ, but this is an error, for
مِفْعَالٌ is not one of the measure of inf. ns.,
(ISd,) [but it is used by some of the professors
of practical law as an inf. n.,] and تُراثٌ: (Msb
[but see وِرْثٌ below]:) He inherited. (S, K,
&c.) You say وَرِثَ أَبَاهُ He inherited [the property of] his father: (S, K:) but the original
phrase is وَرِثَ مَالَ أَبِيهِ He inherited the property of his father. (Msb.) Also وَرِثَ مِنْ أَبِيهِ
(and عَنْهُ, A,) He inherited of his father: (K:)
or he inherited part of the property of his father.
(Msb.) And وَرِثَ الشَّىْءَ مِنْ أَبِيهِ He inherited
the thing of, or from, his father. (S.) When
you say وَرِثَ زَيْدٌ أَبَاهُ مَالًا [Zeyd inherited of his
father property], the word مالا is a second
objective complement, if the verb be doubly
trans.; or it is a substitute of implication
(بَدَلُ اشْتِمَالٍ) for زيد. (MF.) You say وَرِثْتُهُ
مَالَهُ, and مَجْدَهُ, I inherited his property, and,
(tropical:)  his glory: and وَرِثْتُهُ عَنْهُ I inherited it from
him. (TA.)

ورثّهُ, inf. n. تَوْرِيثٌ, He included him among

not being one of them, and assigned him a portion:
(AZ, Msb:) [in like manner,] ورّث فِى مَالِهِ he
included among his heirs of his property one or
more not of them. (TA.) ―

وِرْثٌ and ↓ إِرْثٌ [see 1] and ↓ تُرَاثٌ (in which
the ت is originally و, S,) and مِيرَاثٌ (originally
مِوْرَاثٌ, the و being changed to ى because of the
kesreh immediately preceding it, S.) What is
inherited; an inheritance, or a heritage: or,
accord. to some, ورث and ميراث are used with
reference to property, or wealth; and ارث with
reference to rank or quality, nobility or eminence,
reputation, or the like, in Arabic, حَسَب: (M:)
[the pl. of ميراث is مَوَارِيثُ.] [See also art.

-b2-  It is said in a prayer (of Mohammad,
TA) أَللّٰهُمَّ أَمْتِعْنِى بِسَمْعِى وَبَصَرِى وَاجْعَلْهُ الوَارِثَ
منِّى [O God, cause me to enjoy my hearing and
my sight, and make it (i. e. the enjoyment that
I pray for, TA) survive me: or,] make it to continue with me until I die. (K.) Or, accord. to
another relation, which substitutes وَاجْعَلْهُمَا for
واجعله, make them both to continue with me,
sound, until I die. Or, as some say, what is
meant is the continuance and strength of those
two faculties in old age, so that they may
survive all the other powers: so says ISh.
Some say, that by سَمْع is meant the remembering of what is heard, and the acting according
thereto; and by بَصَر, the being admonished by
what is seen, and the light of the heart, whereby
one escapes from perplexity and darkness to the
right course. (TA.) ―
-b3-  الوَارِثُ (as an epithet
applied to God, TA.) He who remains after
the creatures have perished. (K.) He remains
after everything beside Him has perished; and
thus, what was the property of mankind, his
servants, returns to Him. (TA.)
