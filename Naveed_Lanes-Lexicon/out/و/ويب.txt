ويبوَيْبٌ a word like وَيْلٌ (S, K) and وَيْحٌ and
وَيْسٌ: these four words agree in form and meaning, and have no fifth; although some of the
lexicologists differ, in holding that some of them
relate to what is good, and others to the falling
into destruction. Accord. to what is said by
Z, in the Fáïk, ويب and ويح and ويس denote
compassion: but ويل is used in reviling, and
imprecating destruction. (MF.) IKtt says, in
the Tahdheeb el-Af'ál, that the invariable verbs
are nine in number: نِعْمَ and بِئْسُ and لَيْسَ and
عَسَى and the verb of wonder and وَيْحَ زَيْدٍ and
وَيْبَهُ and وَيْلَهُ and وَيْسَهُ; but that El-Mázinee
asserts the last four to be inf. ns. (TA.) You
say وَيْبَكَ, (S, K,) and وَيْبٌ لَكَ, and وَيْبٌ لِزَيْدٍ,
and وَيْبًا لَهُ, and وَيْبٍ لَهُ, (K,) with the three
different vowel-terminations, both in addressing
a person and in speaking of one who is absent,
(TA,) and وَيْبِهِ, and وَيْبِ غَيْرِهِ, (K,) [and وَيْبَ
غَيْرِكَ, (see below,)] and وَيْبَ زَيْدٍ, (S, K,) and
وَيْبِ زَيْدٍ, (TA,) [and وَيْبُ زَيْدٍ, (see below,)] and
وَيْبِ فُلَانٌ on the authority of IAar, (K,) who
adds, except the بنو اسد, who, it appears, from
his saying this, give fet-h to the ب: (TA:) the
meaning of all which is, May God make woe
(ويل) to cleave to thee! [and ―
-b2-  to Zeyd! &c.:
or Woe to thee! &c.: but see what is said
above.] (S, K.) Dhu-l-Khirak Et-Tuhawee uses
ويب in the sense of ويل, addressing to a wolf
the ejaculation وَيْبَ غَيْرِكَ, [which is therefore the
same in meaning as وَيْبَكَ]: (TA:) but accord.
to what is said by Z, in the Fáïk, وَيْبَكَ and
وَيْبٌ لَكَ &c. signify Mercy on thee! or the like.
(MF.) When ويب is put in the acc. case, it is
so put as an inf. n. (S.) This is the opinion
generally obtaining: the opinion that وَيْبَ is a
verb is extraordinary. (TA.) When you use
the prep. ل, you [generally say] وَيْبٌ لِزَيْدٍ (or
وَيْبًا لِزَيْدٍ, L): when you use ل, it is more
elegant to put ويب in the nom. case, as an inchoative, than in the acc. case: but when you
use ويب as a prefixed noun, with its complement,
the acc. is more elegant than the nom. case:
[i. e., it is more elegant to say وَيْبَ زَيْدٍ than
وَيْبُ زَيْدٍ]. (S, L.) Ks says, Some of the Arabs
say وَيْبَكَ and وَيْبَ غَيْرِكَ; and some of them say
وَيْبًا لِزَيْدٍ, like وَيْلًا لِزَيْدٍ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  وَيْبًا لِهَذَا الأَمْرِ
(K, * TA) i. q. عَجَبًا لَهُ, [I] wonder at, or with
respect to, this thing! (K,) and so وَيْبَهُ. (TA.)
وَيْبَةٌ A measure consisting of twenty-two, or
twenty-four, أَمْدَاد (pl. of مُدٌّ), which see in art.
مك. (K.) Not mentioned by J nor by IF;
and IDrd doubted respecting it. In truth it is
a post-classical word, used by the people of
Syria and Egypt and Africa Proper. (TA.)
[At present, the ويبة in Cairo is the sixth part
of an إِرْدَبّ, which latter is equivalent, very
nearly, to five English bushels.]
