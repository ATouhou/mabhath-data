(TA, from a trad.)
وَقْصٌ: see what next follows.
وَقَصٌ (tropical:)  Fragments, or broken pieces, of sticks,
which are thrown upon, (S,) or into, (K,) a fire:
(S, K:) or small pieces of fire-wood with which
a fire is made to burn more vehemently; (A,
TA;) as also وَقَشٌ: so, says Aboo-Turáb, I
heard Mubtekir say. (TA.)
-A2-  Also, sing. of
أَوْقَاصٌ, as used in relation to the [tax called
صَدَقَة; signifying (tropical:)  What is between one فِرِيضَة
and the next فَرِيضَة: (S, K:) as, for instance,
when camels amount in number to five, one sheep
or goat is to be given for them; and nothing is
to be given for such as exceed that number until
they amount to ten: thus, what is between the
five and the ten is termed وَقَصٌ: (S:) sometimes pronounced ↓ وَقْصٌ: (Msb:) and in like
manner, شَنَقٌ: (S:) or (accord. to some of the
learned, S) وقص relates to bulls and cows particularly, (S, Mgh, Msb,) or to these and to
sheep and goats, (Msb,) and شنق [q. v.] to camels:
(S, Mgh, Msb:) both signifying what is between
one فريضة and the next: (S, Mgh, Msb: *) or,
accord. to Aboo-'Amr, (Mgh, L,) i. e. Esh-Sheybánee, (L,) وَقَصٌ signifies camels for which
it is incumbent to give sheep or goats in payment
of the صَدَقَة, (Mgh, L,) when the camels are
between five and twenty in number; (L;) but
some disapprove of this: (Mgh, L:) accord. to
IB, it signifies sheep or goats taken in payment
of the صَدَقَة for camels. (L.)
-A3-  You also say,
صَارُوا أَوْقَاصًا (assumed tropical:)  They became scattered, or dispersed: and أَتَانَا أَوْقَاصٌ مِنْ بَنِى فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  There
came to us separate portions of the tribe of the
sons of such a one: (Ibn-'Abbád, K: *) اوقاص
in these cases being a pl., [namely of وَقَصٌ,] like
أَسْبَابٌ, pl. of سَبَبٌ. (TA.)
وَقِيصَةٌ: see مَوْقُوصٌ.
وَاقِصَةٌ: see مَوْقُوصٌ.
أَوْقَصُ A man (S, Mgh) short in the neck; (S,
A, Mgh, K;) naturally so: (TA:) or having
the neck inclining and short: (A'Obeyd, TA:)
fem. وَقْصَآءُ. (A, TA.)
-A2-  خُدْ أَوْقَصَ الطَّرِيقَيْنِ
(tropical:)  Take thou the nearer of the two ways: (Ibn-
'Abbád, K: *) or shorter thereof. (A, TA.)
مَوْقُوصٌ A man (S) having his neck broken:
(S, K:) and so مَوْقُوصُ العُنُقِ: (A:) the fem. is
with ة: and ↓ وَاقِصَةٌ occurs in the sense of مَوْقُوصَةٌ
in a trad. of 'Alee, in which he is said to have
given judgment in the case of the قَارِصَة and the
قَامِصَة and the ↓ وَاقِصَة, that the price of blood,
or fine for homicide, should be paid in thirds;
these being three girls, who were playing together, and mounted, one upon another; and
the lowest pinched the middle one, who thereupon leaped off, so that the uppermost fell, and
her neck broke; wherefore he imposed a third
of the fine for the killing of the uppermost upon
the lowest, and the like upon the middle one,
annulling the third of the uppermost because she
aided against herself: (Mgh, TA, in art. قرص,
and Msb,) here, [accord. to those who hold that
وَقَصَ is trans. only,] ↓ واقصة is like رَاضِيَةٌ, in
the phrase عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ; (TA, in art. قرص and in
the present art.;) and is used in the place of
موقوصة for the sake of agreement in form with
the two other epithets: (Mgh, in art. قرص, and
Msb:) ↓ وَقِيصَةٌ, also, signifies having her neck
broken; and its pl. is وَقَائِصُ. (Meyd, as in
Freytag's Lex., excepting that the pl. is there
written وَقَايِصُ.) You say also عُنُقٌ مَوْقُوصَةٌ A
broken neck. (Msb.) And مَوْقُوصٌ is also applied
to a camel, signifying, Become diseased in his
back, and without motion. (Khálid Ibn-Jembeh.)
