above, (M, Msb,) and so the inf. n., (M,) He
walked with an elegant and a proud and self-conceited gait, dragging his ذَيْل [or skirt, or the

6
تَذَاْيَلَ see 1, last sentence but one.
ذَيْلٌ The latter, or kinder, or the last, or kindmost, part of anything. (M, K.) Accord. to
MF, this is the proper signification, and the
other significations here following are tropical.
(TA.) [But in my opinion, the word in each of
the next two senses, or at least in the former of
them; if not strictly proper, is what is termed
حَقِيقَةٌ عُرْفِيَّةٌ, i. e. a word so much used in a
tropical sense as to be, in that sense, conventionally regarded as proper.] ―
-b2-  [A skirt, or lower
extremity, of a garment, reaching nearly, or
quite, to the ground, or that is dragged upon
the ground, when made to hang down:] the
extremity, of a garment, that is next the ground,
and so if not touching it [as well as if touching
it]; an inf. n. used in this sense: (Msb:) or the
part of a waist-wrapper (إِزَار), and of a garment
[of any kind], that is dragged [upon the ground],
(M, K,) when it is made to hang down: (M:)
or the part, of an إِزَار, and of a [garment of the
kind called] رِدَآء, that is made to hang down, and
touches the ground: and the part, of any kind of
garment worn by a woman, that the wearer drags
upon the ground behind her: (Lth, T:) or the
parts, all round, of a woman's garment, that fall
upon the ground: and the portion that is made
to hang down, of a woman's shift and of her
قِنَاع [or head-covering]: you do not [properly]
say of a man that he has a ذَيْل [but only when
you liken the lower part of his garment to the
similar part of a woman's garment]: a man's
having a long garment, such as a shirt and a
جُبَّة, [or his dragging the skirt thereof,] is termed
إِرْفَالٌ: (Khálid Ibn-Jembeh, T:) the pl. of ذَيْلٌ
(in this sense, T, Msb, as relating to a shirt [&c.],
S, and in all its senses, T, M) is أَذْيَالٌ (T, S, M,
Msb, K) and أَذْيُلٌ (El-Hejeree, M, K) [both pls.
of pauc.] and ذُيُولٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) which is a
pl. of mult. (M.) Hence طُولُ الذَّيْلِ is a metonymical expression meaning (tropical:)  Richness, or
competency; because long أَذْيَال generally pertain
to the rich and the prodigal and the proud and
self-conceited: (Er-Rázee, Har p. 493:) and you
say, طَالَ ذَيْلُ فُلَانٍ, meaning (tropical:)  The state, or condition, of such a one became good, and his wealth
became abundant: and هُوَ طَوِيلُ الذَّيْلِ, meaning
(tropical:)  He is rich. (Har p. 319.) ―
-b3-  Of a horse (T,
K) &c., (K,) [i. e.] of a horse and a camel and
the like, (M,) The tail: (T, M, K:) or the tail
when long: (TA:) or the part, of the tail, that is
made to hang down. (M, K.) ―
-b4-  [(assumed tropical:)  Of a cloud,
The skirt; or lower, pendent, part: used in this
sense in the K voce هَيْدَبٌ.] ―
-b5-  ذَيْلُ الرِّيحِ (assumed tropical:)  What
is dragged along, (T, S, O,) or drawn together,
(M,) by the wind, upon the ground, (T, S, O, M,)
of dust (T, M, O) and rubbish: (T, O:) or what
the wind leaves upon the sand, (M, K,) in the
form of a rope, (M,) resembling the track of a
ذَيْل [or skirt] dragged along: (M, K:) or, as
some say, أَذْيَالُالرِّيحِ means (assumed tropical:)  the after-parts of
the wind, with which it sweeps what is light to it.
(M.) ―
-b6-  ذَيْلُ جَبَلٍ (assumed tropical:)  The foot, bottom, base, or
lowest part, of a mountain. (A and TA voce
جَرٌّ.) ―
-b7-  أَذْيَالُ النَّاسِ (assumed tropical:)  The hindmost of the people.
(K.) You say, جَآءَ أَذْيَالٌ مِنَ النَّاسِ (assumed tropical:)  Some few
of the hindmost of the people came. (S, Sgh.) ―

-b2-  Also That
behaves proudly, conceitedly, or vainly, and walks
with an elegant and a proud and self-conceited
gait. (TA.) Applied to a horse, That carries
himself in an elegant and a proud and self-conceited manner, in his step, and in curvetting, or
raising his fore legs together and putting them
down together, and kneading with his hind legs,
or in prancing, as though he dragged along the
ذَيْل [or pendent portion] of his tail. (M.)
ذَائِلٌ, applied to a horse, Having a ذَيْل, (T,
K,) i. e. tail: (T:) and ↓ ذَيَّالٌ having a long ذَيْل:
(T, K:) or the former word has the latter signification; (IKt, T, M;) it means having a long tail:
(S:) and ↓ the latter word, tall, and having a long
ذَيْل, (M, K,) and that carries himself in an
elegant and a proud and self-conceited manner, in
his step; (K;) and is applied in the same sense to a
wild bull: (M:) or the former word signifies short,
and having a long tail; and its fem. is with ة: (T:)
or when a horse is of this description, they say
الذَّنَبِ ↓ ذَيَّالُ, mentioning the ذَنَب. (T, S.) ―
-b2-
Also, applied to a دِرْع, (S, M, K,) [i. e. a coat of
mail, as is shown in the S and TA,] Long (S, M,
K) in the ذَيْل [or shirt]; (S;) and so ذَائِلَةٌ and

or ignominiousness. (S.)
مُذَالٌ; fem. with ة: see the latter in the next
preceding paragraph, in two places. ―
-b2-  The fem.
also means (assumed tropical:)  A female slave: (T, S, M:) because
she is held in low, or mean, estimation, while she
carries herself in an elegant and a proud and selfconceited manner: so in the prov., أَخِيلُ مِنْ مُذَالَةٍ
[More proud and self-conceited than a female
slave]. (S, K.)
مُذْيِلٌ [so in my MS. copy of the K, as in the
M, but in other copies of the K مُذَيَّلٌ,] and
↓ مُتَذَيِّلٌ [in the CK مُتَذَيَّلٌ] i. q. مُتَبَذِّلٌ [One
who performs his own work; or who is careless
of himself or his honour or reputation]. (M, K.)
