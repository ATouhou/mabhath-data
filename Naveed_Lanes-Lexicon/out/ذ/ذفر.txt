-b3-  And
↓ ذَفْرَآءٌ A certain herb, or leguminous plant, (K,)
which remains green until the cold smites it:
[a coll. gen. n.; and with tenween; for] the
n. un. is ذَفْرَآءَةٌ: (TA:) [but it is from ذَفْرَآءٌ, fem.
of أَذْفَرُ:] a certain herb, of foul odour, which
camels &c. scarcely ever eat: (Yaakoob, S:) or a
certain tree, also called عِطْرُ لأَمَةِ: or, accord. to
AHn, a species of [the trees called] حَمْض: or, as
he says in another place, a certain green herb,
which rises a span high, with round leaves, and
with branches, having no flower; the odour of
which is like that of a slight wind from the anus:
it makes the breath of camels to stink; and they
desire it eagerly: it is bitter; and grows in rugged
places: and Abu-n-Nejm describes it as in meadows. (TA.) [Ruta sylvestris. (Golius, from
Er-Rázee.)]
ذَفرَةٌ A single emission of pungent, or strong,
odour. (Msb.)
ذُفْرَةٌ: see ذَفَرٌ.
ذَفَرَةٌ: see ذَفَرٌ.

alif [written ى] is the characteristic of the fem.
gender, (S,) and sometimes, (S, K,) more rarely,
(Sb,) ذِفْرًى, with tenween, (S, K,) when indeterminate, (S,) the alif in this case being considered
as making the word quasi-coordinate to دِرْهَمٌ
(S, K,) The place that sweats, in the back of a
camel's neck, behind the ear: (Lth, S:) or, in a
man, (M,) and in any animal, the part extending
from the مَقَدّ [or part between the two ears,
erroneously written in the CK مُقَدَّم,] to the half
of the قَذَال [or entire back of the head]: or the
prominent bone behind the ear: (M, K:) or a
bone in the upper part of a man's neck, on the
right and left of the small hollow which is in the
middle: (Sh:) or the ذِفْرَيَانِ [which is the dual]
are the two protuberances on the right and left of
the small hollow in the middle of the back of the
neck: (M:) it is from ذَفَرُ العَرَقِ [“ the pungency of
the odour of sweat ”], because it is the first part
that sweats in a camel: (S:) pl. ذِفْرَيَاتٌ and
ذَفَارَى, (S, K,) and some say ذَفَارٍ. (S.)
ذِفَرٌّ: see what next follows.

(AA:) or (so in the TA; but in the K, “and ”)
hard, or firm, and strong: as also ↓ ذِفَرٌّ: (K:)
but the former (ذِفِرٌّ) is of higher authority: also
applied to a camel; fem. with ة: and in like
manner to an ass: (TA:) or (so in the TA; but
in the K, “and ”) great in make: (K:) also a
young man tall, perfect [in make], and hardy,
strong, or sturdy: (S, K:) and ذِفِرَّةٌ an excellent
she-camel, (K,) long-necked: (TA:) and, accord.
to the K, a bulky, or thick, ass: but this is at
variance with what is found in other lexicons.
