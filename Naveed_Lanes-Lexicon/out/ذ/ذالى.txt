ذالى1
ذَلَىالرُّطَبَ, like سَعَى, (K,) [i. e.,] aor.
ذَاَلَ,
inf. n. ذَلْىٌ, (TA,) He gathered the fresh ripe
dates: (K:) so in the copies of the K; in which
is added, فَانْذَلَى مَعَهُ: but what we find in the
Tekmileh is this: ظلّ يذلى الرطب اى يجنيه
فينذلى معه: and يذلى is written as [the aor. of]
a quadriliteral [i. e. as the aor. of اذلى, for it is
without a sheddeh]: (TA:) [here, however,
فينذلى is evidently, in my opinion, a mistranscription for فَيَتَدَلَّى; and the right reading and
rendering I therefore hold to be as follows:
الرُّطَبَ ↓ ظَلَّ يُذْلِى, or perhaps يَذْلَى, means He
continued gathering the fresh ripe dates, they
hanging down with him: for the gatherer laying
hold upon the raceme, it hangs down with his
weight. In the TK, this passage in the TA has
been misunderstood and misrepresented, as though
it meant that أَذْلَى مَعَهُ signifies “ he gathered
with him. ”]
4
أَذْاَلَ see the preceding paragraph.
5
تذلّى i. q. تذلّل [He became lowly, humble,
or submissive; or he lowered, humbled, or submitted, himself]: (T, K:) the latter verb is the
original: the former being like تظنّى, originally
تظنّن. (T.) [See also the next paragraph.]
12
اِذْلَوْلَى, (T, S, M, K,) inf. n. اِذْلِيلَآءٌ, (S,)
He went away hiding himself; stole away
secretly. (T, S, M, K.) ―
-b2-  He hastened, made
haste, sped, or went quickly; (TA;) [like ادلولى;]
and (TA) he did so in fear lest a thing should
escape him. (T, TA.) And اذلولى فَذَهَبَ He
went back, or away, running quickly. (T.) ―
-b3-
He was, or became, easy, tractable, submissive,
or manageable. (M, K.) [See also 5.] ―
-b4-  He
(a man) was, or became, broken-hearted. (T, K.)
―
-b5-  It (the ذَكَر) stood in a lax state. (T, K.)
ذَلَوْلًى, [in copies of the K ذَلَولَى,] applied
to a man, i. q. مُذْلَوْلٍ [part. n. of 12, q. v.]:
(K, TA: [in some copies of the K مَذْلُولٌ:]) of
the measure فَعَوْعَلٌ; or, as some say, فَعَلْعَلٌ.
(TA.)
رِشَآءٌ مُذْلَوْلٍ [A well-rope] unsteady; or moving
about, or to and fro, or from side to side. (T.)
