from the signification next following. (Ham

ذَبٌّ, (M, L,) or ↓ ذَابٌّ, (K,) [the former correct,
and perhaps the latter also,] applied to a camel,
That does not, or will not, remain still, or motionless, in a place. (M, L, K.) A poet says,
فَكَأَنَّنَا فِيهِمْ جِمَالٌ ذَبَّةٌ
[And it was as though we were, among them,
camels that would not remain still in a place]:
which shows that ذَبٌّ is not an inf. n. used as an
epithet; for, were it so, he had said جِمَالٌ ذَبٌّ.
(M, L.) ―
-b2-  الذَّبُّ (tropical:)  The wild bull; [a species of
bovine antelope;] also called ذَبُّ الرِّيَادِ; (T, S,

away: (TA:) and likewise applied to the bee;
(M, K;) which is also called ذُبَابُ الغَيْثِ [the fly
of the rain], (IAth, TA,) or ذُبَابُ غَيْثٍ [the fly
of rain]; because the rain is the means of producing herbage, and by herbage it is fed; (Mgh;)
or because it accompanies rain, and lives upon
that which the rain causes to grow: (IAth, TA:)
[accord. to some, it is a coll. gen. n.; and] the n.
un. is ↓ ذُبَابَةٌ: (S, Msb, K:) one should not say
ذِبَّانَةٌ [as the vulgar do in the present day]: (S:)
or one should not say ↓ ذُبَابَةٌ, though El-Ahmar
and Ks are related to have used this word [as
meaning a kind of fly]; for ذُبَابٌ is a sing. [properly speaking], and is used as such in the Kur
xxii. 72: (M:) the pl. (of pauc., S, Msb) is
أَذِبَّهٌ and (of mult., S, Msb) ذِبَّانٌ (S, M, Msb, K)
and ذُبٌّ, (M, K,) the last mentioned by Sb,
accord. to the dial. of Temeem. (M.) One says,
إِنَّهُ لَأَوْهَى مِنَ الذُّبَابِ [Verily he is more frail
than the fly]. (A.) And هُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَىَّ مِنْ طَنِينِ
الذُّبَابِ [He is more contemptible to me than the
buzzing of the fly]. (A.) مَنْجَى الذُّبَابِ [The
refuge of the fly] is a prov., applied to him who
is protected by his ignobleness. (Har p. 332:
there written مَنْجَا; and in two places, منجأ.)
And أَبُو الذُّبَابِ [The father of the fly] is an
appellation used as meaning (assumed tropical:)  He who has stinking breath; and some say أَبُو الذِّبَّانِ [the father
of the flies]: (M, TA:) and is especially applied
to 'Abd-El-Melik Ibn-Marwán: (M, A, TA:)
whence the saying, أَبْخَرُ مِنْ أَبِى الذُّبَابِ (A, TA)
and أَبِى الذِّبَّانِ (TA) [More stinking in breath
than Abu-dh-Dhubáb and Abu-dh-Dhibbán]. ―

part wherewith one strikes: (S, Msb:) or its
extremity with which one is pierced, or transpierced; and the حَدّ [here meaning edge] with
which one strikes is called its غِرَار: (En-Nadr, T:)
or its tapering, or pointed, extremity; expl. by
طَرَفُهُ المُتَطَرِّفُ: (M, K:) or the point (حَدّ) of its
extremity (M, A) which is between its شَفْرَتَانِ:
(M:) the parts of its two edges that are on either
side of it are its ظُبَتَانِ: the ridge in the middle
of it, on the inner and outer sides, is called the عَيْر;
and each has what are termed غِرَارَانِ, which are the
part between the عَيْر and each one of the ظُبَتَانِ
on the outer side of the sword and the corresponding portion of the inner side, each of the غِرَارَانِ
being on the inner side of the sword and its outer
side. (AZ, T, TA.) [The swords of the Arabs,
in the older times, were generally straight, twoedged, and tapering to a point; and so are many
of them in the present day; a little wider towards
the point than towards the hilt.] Hence the
