ذود1
ذَادَ, (M, A,) first pers. ذُدْتُ, (T, S,) aor.
يَذُودُ, (T, A,) inf. n. ذَوْدٌ, (T,) or ذِيَادٌ, (S,) or
both, (M, A, K,) He drove: (S, M, K:) he
drove away: (T, S, M, A, K:) and he repelled.
(M, K.) You say, ذَدْتُ الإِبِلَ I drove the camels:
(S:) and I drove them away: (T, S:) and [so
↓ ذَوَّدْتُهَا, for] تَذْوِيدٌ signifies the same as ذِيَادٌ.
(S.) And ذاد الإِبَلِ عَنِ المَآءِ, (A, Msb,) aor.
يَذُودُ, inf. n. ذَوْدٌ and ذِيَادٌ, He (the pastor)
[drove away, or repelled, or] kept back, or debarred, the camels from the water; or prevented
them from coming to it. (Msb.) And ذادهُ عَنْ
كَذَا, (A,) and ذُدْتُهُ, (S,) He, and I, drove him
away from such a thing. (S, A. [And the like is
said in the M.]) And ذاد عَنِ الحَرَمِ He repelled
from, or defended, the sacred territory. (L.)
And الثَّوْرُ يَذُودُ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ بِمِذْوَدِهِ, i. e. (tropical:)  [The bull
repels from, or defends, himself] with his horn:
and الفَارِسُ بِمِذْوَدِهِ, i. e. (tropical:)  [the horseman] with
his spear, or short spear. (A.) And ذاد عَنْ

ذَوَّدَ see above.

اذادهُ He aided, or assisted, him to drive, or
drive away, (T, S, M, A,) his camels. (T, S, A.)
[In the K, أَذَدْتُهُ is said to signify أَعَنْتُهُ عَلَى ذِيَادِ
أَهْلِهِ: but اهله is app. a mistake for إِبِلِهِ: or عَنْ
is omitted before اهله; and if so, the meaning is
I aided, or assisted, him to defend his family;
but in this latter case, we should read ذِيَادٍ, which
would be less chaste than الذِّيَادِ.]
ذَوْدٌ A number of camels, from three to ten:
(Lth, AZ, As, T, S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K:) this is
the meaning that is of best repute: (TA:) [in this
explanation in the T from AZ, and in the K, the
nouns of number are mase.; and so in the next
here following: in the rest, fem.:] or from three
to ten: and a little more: (IAar, M:) or from
three to nine: (M, L:) or from three to fifteen:
or from three to twenty; (M, L, K;) and a little
more: (L:) or from three to thirty: (M, L, K:)
or from two to nine: (M, Mgh, L, K:) [said to
be] applied only to females: (Lth, A'Obeyd, T,
M, Mgh, Msb, K:) so in the Bári': (Msb:)
and it is of the fem. gender; (T, S, M, Msb, K;)
i. e., the word is fem.: (MF:) but its dim. is
[↓ ذُوَيْدٌ,] without ة; contr. to analogy: (M:)
the word ذَوْدٌ is a pl., (M, K,) meaning a quasipl. n., (MF,) having no sing. (S, M, K) of the
same root: (S:) or a sing.; (K;) and its pl. is
أَذْوَادٌ: (T, S, M, A, Msb, K:) or a sing. and pl.:
(M, K:) the Arabs said ثَلَاثُ أَذْوَادٍ and ثَلَاثُ ذَوْدٍ
and so with all the inferior ns. of number, making
ذَوْد a substitute for أَذْوَاد: and they also said
ثَلَاثُ ذَوْدٍ meaning thereby three she-camels.
(M, L.) It is said in a trad., لَيْسَ فِيمَا دُونَ خَمْسِ
ذَوْدٍ مِنَ الإِبِلِ صَدَقَةٌ, (T, L,) or لَيْسَ فِىأَقَلَّ مِنْ
خَمْسٍ ذَوْدٍ صَدَقَةٌ, (T, Msb,) meaning [There is not
in the case of less than five] camels [any poorrate]: for the poor-rate is incumbent on him who
possesses five camels whether they be males or
females. (L.) And in another trad. it is said,
فِى خَمْسِ ذَوْدٍ شَاةٌ [In the case of five camels, a
sheep or goat shall be given]. (Mgh.) And it is
said in a prov., الذَّوْدُ إِلَى الذَّوْدِ إِبِلٌ [A few she-camels with a few she-camels are a herd of
camels]; (T, S, M, A;) meaning that a little with
a little is much; الى being here used in the sense
of مَعَ: (S, A:) or الى is here used in its proper
sense; a word signifying “ joined ” or the like
being understood; (TA;) i. e. a few joined to a
few becomes much: (M:) [or,] accord. to the K
[and the T], this prov. shows that ذود is here
used in the place of اِثْنَتَانِ [i. e. two she-camels];
for two added to two are a pl.; but this requires
consideration. (MF.)

―
-b4-  (tropical:)  The tongue: (S, M, A, K:) because with it
a man defends his honour. (M.) Hassán Ibn-Thábit says,
لِسَانِى وَسَيْفِى صَارِمَانِ كِلَاهُمَا
وَيَبْلُغُ مَا لَا يَبْلُغُ السَّيْفُ مِذْوَدِى
(tropical:)  [My tongue and my sword are sharp, both of
them; and my tongue reacheth what my sword
will not reach]. (S, TA.) ―
