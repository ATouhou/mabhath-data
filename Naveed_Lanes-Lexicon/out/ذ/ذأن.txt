ذأن1
ذَأَنَهُ, [aor.
ذَاَ^َ,] inf. n. ذَأْنٌ, [app. from ذُؤْنُونٌ,
q. v.,] He held his state, or condition, to be contemptible and weak. (TA.)
R. Q. 1
ذَأْنَنَتِ الأَرْضُ The land produced the
kind of plant called ذُؤْنُون. (IAar, M.)
R. Q. 2
خَرَجُوا يَتَدَأْنَنُونَ (S, so in both of my
copies, and K and TK, but [erroneously] written
in the TT as from the M يتذأْنون, and in some
copies of the K يَتَذَآئَنُونَ, or يَتَذَآءَنُونَ, [the verb
being evidently a denominative from ذُؤْنُونٌ like
تَجَلْبَبَ from جِلْبَابٌ,]) They went forth (S, M,
K) to take, (S,) or to seek and take, (M,) or to
gather, (K,) the kind of plant called ذُؤْنُون
(S, M, K.)
ذُؤْنُونٌ [A kind, or species, of fungus; perhaps
a species of phallus;] a certain plant, (T, S, K,)
of the same kind as the عُرْجُون and the طُرْثُوثِ,
which grows in the winter, and, when the day
becomes hot, rots, and goes away; (IAar, T;)
said by Abu-l-'Omeythil to be, in form, like the
هِلْيَوْن [or asparagus]: (T:) pl. ذَآنِينُ: (T, S:)
and some pronounce the sing. ذُونُونٌ, without ء;
and make the pl. ذَوَانِينُ: (T, TA:) a certain
plant that grows at the roots of the أَرْطَى and
رِمْث and أَلَآء; the ground cleaving, and disclosing
it, it comes forth like the سَوَاعِد [app. here
meaning the upper arms, above the elbows,] of
men; has no leaves; is black (أَسْحَمُ), and dustcoloured; is pointed [and roundish] in its extremity, like the glans of the penis in form; has
envelopes (أَكْمَامُ) like those of the [bean called]
بَاقِلَّى; and has a yellow fruit at its upper part:
some say that it is a plant that grows like the
[fungi called] عَرَاجِين, of the plants termed فُطْر:
AHn says that what are termed ذَآنِين are things
of the [fungi called] فُقُوع, that come forth from
beneath the ground like thick عُمُد [or poles];
nothing eats them, except that camels feed upon
them in the year of drought, and goats eat them
and fatten upon them; they have a root-stock
(أَرُومَة); and are used as medicines; and none
but the hungry will eat them, because of their
bitterness: he also says in one place, they grow
at the roots of trees, most like to the asparagus
(هِلْيَوْن), except that they are larger and thicker;
and have no leaves; but they have a بُرْعُومَة [app.
here meaning a head, such as is termed a pileus,
or cap], which assumes a roseate colour, and then
changes to yellow: the ذؤنون is all [full of]
water [or juice]; and is white, except what
appears thereof, of that بُرْعُومَة; and nothing eats
it, except when men are afflicted with drought
and have nothing [else] to eat: the n. un. is with
ة: (M:) ISh says that it is of a tawny colour,
smooth and round, having leaves that stick to it,
tall like the طُرْثُوث, not eaten save by sheep or
goats, [and grows] in plain, or soft, tracts: IB
says that it is the wild هِلْيَوْن. (TA.) One says
of a people who were characterized by courage
and excellence, and who have perished, their state
having changed, ذَآنِينُ لَا رِمْثَ لَهَا وَ طَرَاثِيثُ لَا أَرْطَى
[Dhu-noonehs having no rimthehs, and turthoothehs having no artáhs]: meaning that they have
been extirpated, and that none of them remains:
(TA:) or ذآنين لا رمث لها is a prov. applied
to him who is ruined, and has nothing remaining,
after having had a family and dignity and wealth.
(TA voce طُرْثُوثٌ.)
