ذalphabetical letter
ذ
The ninth letter of the alphabet; called ذَالٌ:
it is one of the letters termed مَجْهُورَة [or vocal,
i. e. pronounced with the voice, and not with the
breath only]: and of the letters termed لِثَوِيَّة [or
gingival], which are ث and ذ and ظ; wherefore
it is substituted for ث in تَلَعْذَمَ for تَلَعْثَمَ; and it
is said to be substituted for the unpointed د in
فَشَرِّذْ بِهِمْ, [as some read] in the Kur [viii. 59,
for فَشَرِّدْ بهم]. (TA.)
-A2-  [As a numeral, it denotes
Seven hundred.]
