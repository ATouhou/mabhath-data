the measure of the first being فُعُّولَةٌ or فُعِّيلَةٌ; [so
that it is originally ذُرُّوءَةٌ or ذُرِّيْئَةٌ;] (TA;) but the ء
is suppressed because of frequency of usage: (M:)
accord. to others, from الذَّرُّ, signifying “ the act of
scattering; ” because God scattered the ذرّيّة upon the
earth; and the measure is فُعْلِيَّةٌ or فُعُّولَةٌ, [if the
latter,] the word being originally ذُرُّورَةٌ, the last
ر being changed into ى, in a manner similar to
the case of تَقَضَّتِ العُقَابِ [in which تَقَضَّضَت
becomes تَقَضَّيَت and then تَقَضَّت; so that ذُرُّورَةٌ
becomes ذُرُّويَةٌ and then ذُرِّيَّةٌ]: (TA:) Children,

from Thee, a good offspring]. (Mgh.) And in a

And he put me among the little ones, or young
ones. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  It is also applied to signify

[We carried their progenitors in the laden ark].
(T.) ―
-b3-  And it is used also to signify Women;
[because they are the sources of offspring;] (T,
Mgh, TA;) like as سَمَآءٌ is used to signify “ rain: ”
(TA:) as in the saying of 'Omar, حُجُّوا بِالذُّرِّيَّةِ
[Perform ye the pilgrimage with the women].
(T, Mgh, TA. [See his saying in full, voce
رِبْقٌ.])

(T.)
أَذْرَأُ; fem. ذَرْآءُ: see 1, last sentence. Applied to
a ram, Having whiteness in the head; (M, K;)
and so the fem. applied to a ewe: (M:) or having
the ears variegated, or speckled, with black and
white, and the rest black: (K:) or it has this
latter meaning when applied to a horse, and to a
kid; and so the fem. applied to a female kid,
(S, O,) or to a she-goat: (M:) and is not applied
to the sheep-kind. (S, O.)
