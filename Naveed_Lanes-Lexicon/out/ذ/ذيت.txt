ذيتذَيْتَ وَذَيْتَ (AO, S, M voce ذَا, Msb, * K) and
ذَيْتِ وَذَيْتِ and ذَيْتُ وَذَيتُ, (K,) the last of which
is unknown, except as mentioned by IKtt, (TA,)
and ذَيَّةَ وَذَيَّةَ (M, K) and ذَيَّآءَ وَذَيَّآءَ, (K,) i. q.
كَيْتَ وَكَيْتَ: (AO, S, M, Msb, * K:) so in the
saying, كَانَ مِنَ الأَمْرِ ذَيْتَ وَذَيْتَ [&c., Some of
the circumstances of the case were thus and thus,
or so and so, or such and such things]. (AO, S,
M.) It is plainly implied in the K [and the S]
that the ت in ذيت is a radical letter, the last
radical letter of the word: but AHei says that the
ت in ذيت and كيت is substituted for ى; that
they are originally ذَيَّةَ and كَيَّةَ; and that the ة
is elided, and the ى which is the last radical
letter is changed into ت: [in like manner also
says ISd in the M, voce ذَا:] and most of the
leading authorities on inflection assert the same:
therefore, [though most persons would look for
them among words of which the last radical letter
is ت,] they are incorrectly placed in the K [and
in the S]. (MF.) Or ذَيْتَ is formed from ذَيْوٌ,
by eliding the و and doubling the ى and then
substituting for the teshdeed ت; and if you elide
the ت and replace it by ه, you must restore the
teshdeed, and say, كَانَ ذَيَّهْ وَذَيَّهْ. (S at the end
of art. ذو.)
