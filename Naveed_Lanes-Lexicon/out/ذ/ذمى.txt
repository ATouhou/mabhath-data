last gasp. (T, K.) And اذمى رَمِيَّتَهُ He failed
of hitting the animal at which he shot, or cast, in

and Meyd in explanation of a prov. cited in
what follows,) in a slaughtered animal: (S:) or
strength of heart: (M, K:) or the state between
slaughter and the exit of the soul; but there is no
ذَمَآء in the case of a human being: or strong
tenaciousness of life after slaughter. (Meyd in
explaining the prov. above referred to.) It is
said, الضَّبُّ أَطْوَلُ شَىْءٍ ذَمَآءً [The lizard called
ضبّ is the longest thing in retaining the remains
of life, &c.]. (T, S.) Hence the prov., أَطْوَلُ
ذَمَآءً مِنَ الضَّبِّ [Longer in retaining the remains
of life, &c., than the ضبّ]. (Meyd, TA.) ―
