ذخر1
ذَخَرَهُ, aor.
ذَخَرَ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) inf. n. ↓ ذُخْرٌ,
(S, K,) or this is a simple subst., and the inf. n. is
ذَخْرٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ اِدَّخَرَهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) of the
measure اِفْتَعَلَ, (S, Msb,) originally اِذْتَخَرَهُ, the
ت being changed into د, and the ذ being incorporated into it; and some of the Arabs say ↓ اِذَّخَرَهُ,
which is allowable; but the former is more common; (Zj;) He hoarded it, treasured it, or laid
it up for the future; reposited it, or stored it, in
secret; (A;) or he prepared it, or provided it;
(Msb;) for a time of need: (A, Msb:) or he
chose it, or selected it, and (so in some copies of the
K and in the TA, but in other copies of the K “ or ”)
took it for himself, or prepared it. (K.) Some
have made a distinction between ذخر and دخر,
saying that the former relates to the world to
come, and the latter to the present world; but
this is a manifest mistake. (MF and others.) ―

ذَخِيرَةٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ ذَخْرٌ (A, Msb, * K)
A thing hoarded, treasured, or laid up; reposited,
or stored, in secret; (A;) or prepared, or provided;
(Msb;) for a time of need: (A, Msb:) or taken
for one's self, or prepared: (K:) pl. of the

the believer are things laid up for the time of

ذَاخِرٌ (assumed tropical:)  Fat; as an epithet. (AA, K.)
إِذْخِرٌ [A kind of sweet rush; juncus odoratus;
or schœnanthum;] a certain plant, (S, Mgh, Msb,)
or herb, (K,) well known, (Msb,) in form resembling the كَوْلَان [or papyrus-plant], (Mgh,)
sweet-smelling, (K,) or of pungent odour; (Mgh,
Msb;) which, when it dries, becomes white; (Msb;)
used for roofing houses, over the wood, and for
graves: (TA:) it has a root hidden in the ground,
slender, pungent in odour; and is like the straight
stalks of the كَوْلَان [or papyrus-plant], save that
it is wider, and smaller in the كُعُوب [which
means either the joints or the internodal portions];
and it has a fruit resembling the brooms of reeds,
but more slender, and smaller: it is ground, and
is an ingredient in perfumes: it grows in rugged
and in smooth grounds; but seldom does more
than one grow on the same spot: when it dries, it
becomes white: (AHn:) 'Iyád asserts that its ء is
a radical letter; but this is a mistake: (MF:) the
n. un. is إِذْخِرَةٌ; (S;) which is applied to a single
plant, (AHn,) or to a single fascicle thereof.
(Mgh.)
مِذْخَرٌ (tropical:)  The [part of the intestines called] عَفَج:
(TA:) [its pl.] مَذَاخِرُ is also explained as signifying the intestines; and bellies; (S, K;) and
veins: (K:) or the lower part of the belly: (As,
K:) or the parts of the inside of a beast in which
he stores his fodder and water. (A.) You say
فُلَانٌ مَلَأَ مَذَاخِرَهُ (tropical:)  Such a one filled the lower parts
of his belly. (As.) And مَلَأَتِ الدَّابَّةُ مَذَاخِرَهَا
(tropical:)  The beast satiated itself. (TA.) And تَمَلَّأَتْ
مَذَاخِرُهُ (tropical:)  He became satiated. (A.) And مَلَأَ
لَنَا فِى مَذَاخِرِهِ عَدَاوَةً (tropical:)  [He filled his heart with
enmity towards us]. (A.)
مُدَّخِرٌ, or مُذَّخِرٌ, (accord. to different copies of
the K,) (assumed tropical:)  A horse that reserves his run; expl. by
المُبْقِى لِحُضْرِهِ: (AO, K, TA:) [Freytag's reading
of مُذَخَّرٌ for مُدَّخِرٌ or مُذَّخِرٌ, and his proposed
emendation, of المَنْقِىُّ for المُبْقِى, both taken from
the TK, but neither found by me in any copy of
the K, are evidently wrong: see ذَخَرَ مِنْ عَدْوِهِ,
above:] such is the مِسْوَاط, a horse “ that will
not give what he has without the whip: the fem.
is with ة. (TA.)
