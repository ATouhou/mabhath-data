heavily-burdened, or overburdened, camel sought

(S, M, K:) a prov., applied to a low, base, or

one who has no power of defending, and by
means of one more low, base, or mean, and weak,
than he: (M:) or to him who seeks to help

the language of the Nabathæans. (TA.)

the تَرْقُوة [ or collar-bone; or it may here mean
the fore part of the throat, next the chest; or the
uppermost part of the chest]: (K:) but this, in

by ISd and by Z: (TA:) or the pit of the uppermost part of the breast, or chest: or the upper
part of the belly: (K:) and the stomach: (JK:)

lower part of the belly. (S.)
