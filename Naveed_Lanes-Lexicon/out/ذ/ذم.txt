and ↓ ذمّمهُ, (MA,) inf. n. تَذْمِيمٌ, (KL,) signifies
the same: (MA, KL:) [or this has an intensive

the saying, اِفْعَلْ كَذَا وخَلَاكَ ذَمٌّ, (T, S, K,) i. e.
خَلَا مِنْكَ ذَمٌّ, meaning [Do thou such a thing,
and] thou wilt not be blamed; (ISk, S, K;) or

إِلَيْهِ ↓ استذمّ, (M, K,) or إِلَى النَّاسِ, (S,) He did

though she made the people to blame her. (TA.)
And أَذَمَّتْ رِكَابُهُمْ (tropical:)  Their camels upon which

from ذَمَّةٌ meaning “ a well having little water. ”
(TA.) And اذمّ بِهَ بَعِيرُهُ (tropical:)  [His camel became
jaded, and lagged behind with him]. (S, TA.)
And أَذَمَّتْ بِالرَّكْبِ, said of a she-ass, (tropical:)  She kept

weakness and her ceasing to go on. (TA from
a trad.)
-A2-  اذمّهُ He found him, or it, to be such

تذمّم He shunned, or avoided, (T, * Mgh,)
or he preserved, or guarded, himself from, (MA,)
blame, dispraise, &c.: (T, * MA, Mgh:) this is
the proper meaning; and hence, (Mgh,) he felt
disdain, or scorn, and shame. (S, MA, Mgh, K,
KL.) One says, لَوْ لَمْ أَتْرُكِ الكَذِبَ تَأَثُّمًا لَتَرَكْتُهُ
تَذَمُّمَا [If I did not refrain from lying for the
purpose of abstaining from sin, I would refrain
from it from a feeling of disdain, or scorn, or
shame]. (S, K.) And تذمّم مِنْهُ [He abstained,
or refrained, from it to avoid blame, or through
disdain, or scorn, or shame; disdained, or scorned,
it; or was ashamed of it]. (K in art. حشم.)
And Aboo-'Amr Ibn-El-'Alà mentions his having
heard an Arab of the desert use the expression لا
يذمّون [app. ↓ لَا يُذِمُّونَ, for the ا in the measure
أَفْعَلَ sometimes has a privative property,] meaning They do not shun, or avoid, blame;
(لَا يَتَذَمَّمُونَ;) and are not affected with shame.
(TA.) It is said in a trad., مِنْ خِلَالِ المَكَارِمِ
التَّذَمُّمُ لِلصَّاحِبِ, meaning [Of the properties of
generous, or honourable, practices, is] the being
regardful of everything that is entitled to reverence, respect, honour, or defence, in the character
and appertenances of the companion, or friend,
and dispelling from oneself the blame that he would
incur from men if he were not regardful thereof.

ذَمِيمَةٌ; (M, K;) A well containing little water;
(T, S, M, Mgh, K;) because discommended: (M,

(T, TA,) [or rather the latter is a coll. gen. n., of
which ذَمَّةٌ is the n. un.] A poet says, (S,)
namely, Dhu-r-Rummeh, describing camels whose
eyes were sunk in their sockets by reason of
fatigue, (T,)
عَلَى حِمْيَرِيَّاتٍ كَأَنَّ عُيُونَهَا
ذِمَامُ الرَّكَايَا أَنْكَزَتْهَا المَوَاتِحُ
[Upon camels of Himyer that were as though
their eyes were wells containing little water which
the camels employed to draw it had exhausted].
(T, S.)
ذِمَّةٌ A compact, a covenant, a contract, a
league, a treaty, an engagement, a bond, or an
obligation; (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) because
the breaking thereof necessitates blame: (Mgh:)
and a right, or due, (حَقٌّ,) for the neglect of
which one is to be blamed: (Bd in ix. 8:) [an
inviolable right or due:] and ↓ ذِمَامٌ and ↓ مَذِمَّةٌ
and ↓ مَذَمَّةٌ signify in like manner a compact, a
covenant, &c. as above, for the neglect, or nonobservance, of which a man is to be blamed:
(Msb:) or these three words [in the CK the
first and last only] signify a right, or due; syn.
حَقٌّ: (M, K:) or so the first of them: (T, * S:)
and each of them, (M, K,) or the first of them,
i. e. ذِمَامٌ, (T, S, Mgh,) i. q. حُرْمَةٌ [which includes
all the significations of ذِمَّةٌ likewise, those above
and those which follow, but appears here to be
used as meaning especially a thing that should be
sacred, or inviolable; or which one is under an
obligation to reverence, respect, or honour, and
defend; everything that is entitled to reverence,
respect, honour, or defence. in the character and
appertenances of a person]; (S, M, Mgh, K;) every
حُرْمَة for the neglect, or non-observance, of which
one is to be blamed: (T:) ↓ ذَمَامَةٌ, also, and
↓ ذِمَامَةٌ, are syn. with حَقٌّ and حُرْمَةٌ: (TA:)
and ذِمَّةٌ signifies also i. q. أَمَانٌ [as meaning
security, or safety; security of life and property;
protection, or safeguard; a promise, or an assurance, of security, safety, protection, or safeguard;
indemnity; or quarter]; (S, Mgh, Msb, KL,
TA;) and so ↓ ذِمَامٌ: (MA, KL: [explained in
both by the Pers. زِنْهَارْ; and in the latter by
حُرْمَةٌ and حَقٌّ also:]) and responsibility [for the
fulfilment of an obligation, for the payment of a
sum of money, for the restitution of a thing, or
for the safety, or safe-keeping, of a thing or
person]; suretiship; (M, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also
↓ ذَمَامَةٌ and ↓ ذِمَامَةٌ; (M, K; [in the former of
which, these two words are said to be syn. with
ذِمَّةٌ, app. meaning, in all the senses mentioned
above;]) and ↓ ذِمٌّ: (M, K: [said in the M to
be syn. with ذِمَّةٌ in the first only of the senses
mentioned above in this paragraph: in the CK,
والذِّمُّ is erroneously put for وَ الذِّمِّ:]) the pl. of
ذِمَّةٌ is ذِمَمٌ (T, Msb) and ذِمَامٌ: (T:) and the pl.
of ↓ ذِمَامٌ as [a sing.] syn. with [ذِمَّةٌ and] مَذَمَّةٌ
and مَذِمَّةٌ is أَذِمَّةٌ. (M, K.) Hence, i. e. from
ذِمَّةٌ in the first of the senses explained above,
أَهلُ الذِّمَّةِ, (S, Mgh, TA.) and الذِّمِّةُ, (T, M, *
Mgh, K, TA,) with the prefixed noun اهل suppressed, (TA,) The people with whom a compact,
or covenant, &c., has been made; (T, S, M, K,
TA;) [and particularly] those, of the believers
in a plurality of Gods, [by which are here meant
the Christians, Jews, and Sabians, but no others,]
who pay the [tax called] جِزْيَة; (T, TA;) [i. e.
the free non-Muslim subjects of a Muslim government, who pay a poll-tax for which the Muslims
are responsible for their security and freedom
and toleration: see أَهْلٌ:] the appellation ↓ ذِمِّىٌّ,
(Mgh, Msb,) a rel. n. from الذِّمَّةُ, (Msb;) is
applied to a person of this class; (Mgh, Msb;)
because he is rendered secure, or free from fear,
for his property and his blood, by means of the
جِزْيَة. (Mgh.) جَعَلَ عُمَرُ أَهْلَ السَّوَادِ ذِمَّةً means
'Omar treated [lit. made] the people of the Sawád
as those who are termed أَهْلُ الذِّمَّةِ. (Mgh.) And
أَقْبِلْنَا بِذِمَّةٍ [or أَقْلِبْنَا?], in the prayer of the traveller,
means Restore us to our family in safety. (TA.) It
is related in a trad. of 'Alee, that he said, ذِمَّتِى بِمَا
أَقُولُ رَهِينَةٌ وَ أَنَا بِهِ زَعِيمٌ, meaning My responsibility is pledged for [the truth of] what I say,
and I am answerable for it; (Mgh, TA; *) i. e.
this my saying is true, and I am responsible for
it. (Mgh.) And it is said in another trad., فَقَدْ
بَرِئَتْ مِنْهُ الذِّمَّة [Then the responsibility of God
is clear, or quit, of him]; i. e. there is given to
every one, by God, a covenant whereby He
binds Himself to preserve and protect him; and
when he throws himself into destruction, or does
that which is unlawful for him to do, or acts at
variance with that which he is commanded to do,
the covenant of God fails to aid him. (TA.)
فِى ذِمَّتِى كَذَا means فى ضَمَانِى [virtually I am
responsible for such a thing; i. e. for paying it,
or restoring it, &c.; but lit. in my responsibility
is such a thing; or on my responsibility rests, or
lies, or be, such a thing; for فى may be here
used, as it is in many other instances, in the
sense of عَلَى]: (Msb:) [or,] in the saying
ثَبَتَ فِى ذِمَّتِى كَذَا, [which means Such a thing
became, or has become, binding, obligatory, or
incumbent, on me,] the term ذِمَّة is applied to
designate [the moral sense considered as] the seat
[of the sense] of obligation to fulfil what is [properly] termed ذِمَّة [i. e. a compact, or covenant,
or the like]. (Mgh.) الرَّضَاعِ ↓ مَا يُذْهِبُ عَنِّى مَذِمَّةَ
(T, S, Mgh, *) or الرَّضَاعِ ↓ مَذَمَّةَ, (T, Mgh,) meaning [What will put away from me the obligation
of] the right, or due, of the woman who has
suckled for the sucking? is a question occurring
in a trad., (T, S, Mgh, *) as put by a man to the
Prophet: (T:) and the answer was, “A slave,
male or female: ” (T, S, Mgh:) En-Nakha'ee
says, (S,) they liked, on the occasion of the weaning of a child, to give the woman who had
suckled it something beside the hire: (S, Mgh:)
↓ مَذَمَّةٌ in this case is a dial. var. of ↓ مَذِمَّةٌ:
(Mgh:) or, as IAth says, the former is from
الذَّمُّ; and the latter, from الذِّمَّهُ. (TA.) You
say also, الرَّضَاعِ بِشَّىْءٍ تُعْطِيهِ ↓ أَذْهِبْ عَنْكَ مَذَمَّ
الظِّئْرَ and الرَّضَاعِ ↓ مَذِمَّ, meaning [Put away from
thee the obligation of] the right, or due, that is
incumbent on thee to render her for the sucking
of thy child [by something that thou shalt give to
her who has suckled]. (T.) And أَذْهِبْ عَنْكَ
بِشَىْءٍ ↓ مَذِمَّتَهُمْ and ↓ مَذَمَّتَهُمْ, (T, and so accord. to
different copies of the S and K, in which عنك is
omitted,) مَذَمَّة being a dial. var., (T,) i. e. [Put
away from thee the obligation of their right, or
due, by something; meaning] feed them with
something, (T,) or give to them something, (S, K,)
for they have a right, or due. (T, S, K.) And
↓ قَضَى مَذِمَّتَهُ and ↓ مَذَمَّتَهُ [He paid his right,
or due;] meaning he did good to him, or conferred upon him a benefit or benefits, in order
that he might not be blamed. (M, K.) And رَجُلٌ
↓ ذُو مَذِمَّةٍ and ↓ مَذَمَّةٍ [in the CK the latter only,

عَلَى النَّاسِ (tropical:)  [a man who is a burden upon people,
to be maintained, or supported, by them]. (M, K,
