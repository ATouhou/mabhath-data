ذول2
ذَوَّلْتُ ذَالًا I wrote a ذ; (Az, Sgh, K;) or
ذَالًا حَسَنَةٌ [a beautiful ذ]. (B, TA.) [See also 2
in art. ذيل.]
ذَالٌ A certain letter of the alphabet, (Lth,
ISd, K,) [ذ,] pronounced with the voice, [not
with the breath only,] and always a radical, not
a substitute for another letter, nor augmentative;
(ISd, TA;) its place of utterance is at the roots
of the teeth, near the place of utterance of ت [or
ث]; and it may be masc. and fem.; (B, TA;)
[but generally it is fem.; and therefore] the dim.
is ↓ ذُوَيْلَةٌ: (K:) the pl. is أَذْوَالٌ and ذَالَاتٌ.
(TA.)
-A2-  Also The comb of a cock. (Kh, TA.)
ذَوِيلٌ, explained by IDrd as signifying What
is dry, of plants &c., and so in the K, is said by
ISd to be correctly دَوِيلٌ [q. v.]. (TA.)
ذُوَيْلَةٌ: see ذَالٌ, above.
