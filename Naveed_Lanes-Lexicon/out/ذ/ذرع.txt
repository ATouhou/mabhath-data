ذرع1
ذَرْعٌ, [inf. n. of ذَرَعَ,] in its primary acceptation, signifies The stretching forth, or extending,
the arm, or fore leg: (S, TA:) [or rather, when
said of a man, the fore arm; and of a beast, the
arm; though the whole arm of a man is generally
stretched forth with his fore arm, and the whole
fore leg of a beast with his arm: and ↓ تَذْرِيعٌ
and ↓ إِذْرَاعٌ and ↓ تَذَرُّعٌ signify the same, as will
be shown by explanations of their verbs.] You
say, ذَرَعَ البَعِيرُ يَدَهُ The camel stretched forth, or

also ↓ ذرّعهُ: (K:) or the latter, inf. n. تَذْرِيعٌ,
signifies, simply, he strangled, or throttled, him;
(S, L;) but more properly, he put his neck between
his fore arm and neck and upper arm, and so
strangled, or throttled, him; and لَهُ ↓ ذرّع, also,
has both of these significations. (L.) ―

K,) inf. n. as above, (Ibn-'Abbád,) (tropical:)  He made

الأَمِيرِ (tropical:)  I made intercession for such a one with
the prince. (Z, TA.) And ذَرِعَ إِلَيْهِ, like فَرِحَ,

تَذَرَّعَ see 1; first and second sentences: ―

-b3-  تَذَرُّعٌ also signifies The measuring a
thing with the fore arm. (S, K.) [See also 1.] A
poet says, (S,) namely Keys Ibn-El-Khateem
El-Ansáree, (TA,)
تَرَى قِصَدَ المُرَّانِ تُلْقَى كَأَنَّهَا
تَذَرُّعُ خِرْصَانٍ بِأَيْدِىالشَّوَاطِبِ
[Thou seest the fragments of the hard and pliant
spears thrown as though they were what is seen
in the measuring, with the fore arm, of rods of
palm-sticks in the hands of the females who pare
them]: (S, TA:) or, accord. to As, تَذَرَّعَ فُلَانٌ
الجَرِيدَ signifies Such a one put the palm-sticks
upon his fore arm, and pared them: and خِرْصَانٌ
means, originally, rods of palm-sticks: and
شَوَاطِبُ is pl. of شَاطِبَةٌ; meaning a woman who
peels the عَسِيب, and then throws it to the مُنَقِّيَة,

-b5-  تَذَرَّعَتِ المَرْأَةُ
The woman split palm-leaves to make of them a

of Ibn-El-Khateem, quoted above. (TA.) ―

ذَرِيعَة [q. v.] for him. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
ذَرْعٌ, in its primary acceptation, has the signification explained in the first sentence of this
article. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, it is used in the
sense of] (tropical:)  Power, or ability; as also ↓ ذِرَاعٌ; (TA;)
or a man's reach, or extent of power or ability.
(Msb.) And hence the phrases, ضَاقَ بِالأَمْرِ ذَرْعُهُ,
and ↓ ذِرَاعُهُ, (K,) and ضَاقَ بِالأَمْرِ ذَرْعًا, (S, Msb,
K,) in which the last word is in the accus. case
as an explicative, for the original form of the
phrase is that first mentioned, (TA,) and sometimes they said ↓ ذِرَاعًا, (S, TA,) (tropical:)  He was unable
to do, or accomplish, the thing, or affair; as
though meaning, he stretched forth his arm to it
and it did not reach it; (S, TA; *) or these phrases
are thus used because he who is short in the fore
arm will not reach that which he who is long
therein reaches, nor will the power of the former
equal that of the latter; therefore they are proverbially applied to him whose power falls short
of the attainment, or accomplishment, of an affair:
(TA:) or he lacked strength, or power, or ability,
to do, or accomplish, the thing, or affair, and
found not any way of escape from what was
disagreeable therein: (K:) or he was unable to
bear, or endure, or undertake, the thing, or affair.
(Msb.) You say also, مَا لِى بِهِ ذَرْعٌ, and ↓ ذِرَاعٌ,
(tropical:)  I have not power, or ability, to do it. (TA.)
And كَسَرَ ذٰلِكَ مِنْ ذَرْعِى (tropical:)  That disabled, hindered, prevented, or withheld, me from doing that
which I desired. (TA.) And اِقْصِدْ بِذَرْعِكَ
(tropical:)  Deal thou gently with thyself; moderate thyself
restrain thyself; i. q. اِرْبَعْ عَلَى نَفْسِكَ; (S, TA;)
and let not thy soul, or mind, carry thee beyond
thy measure or extent [of power or ability].
(TA.) And أَبْطَرْتُ فُلَانًا ذَرْعهُ (tropical:)  I imposed upon
such a one more than he was able to do: (S, TA:)
but ذَرْعٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  the body: and [accord. to
IAar] أَبَطَرَنِى ذَرْعِى means (tropical:)  He wasted my body,
and cut off my means of subsistence. (TA.)
[See also art. بطر.] You likewise say, رَجُلٌ
↓ رَحْبُ الذِّرَاعِ [and الذَّرْعِ] (tropical:)  A man having ample
strength, and power, and might in war or fight,
courage, valour, or prowess. (TA. [See also
رَحْبٌ.]) And ضَعِيفُ الذَّرْعِ (tropical:)  Impotent. (KL.)
―
-b3-  And hence, فُلَانٌ خَالِى الذَّرْعِ (tropical:)  Such a one
has his heart devoid of anxieties, or solicitudes,
and griefs; because the heart is sometimes one of
the seats of power: or it may mean, agreeably
with the original signification of ذَرْعٌ, such a one
is free from the causes of occupation which require the stretching forth of the fore arm and
extending of the hand. (Har p. 131.) And
رَجُلٌ وَاسِعٌ الذَّرْعِ, and ↓ الذِّرَاعِ, (tropical:)  A man large, or
liberal, in disposition. (K.) And كَبُرَ فِى ذَرْعِى
(assumed tropical:)  Its occurrence, or befalling, was of great moment, momentous, grievous, or distressing, to
me. (TA.) ―
-b4-  ذَرْعٌ also signifies The measure of
anything: and نَخْلَةٌ ذَرْعُ رَجَلٍ, A palm-tree of the
measure of the stature of a man. (TA.)
ذَرَعٌ A coveting; desiring eagerly; or lusting.
(S, K.) [Perhaps an inf. n. of which the verb is
ذَرِعَ.]
-A2-  See also ذَرِيعَةٌ.
ذَرِعٌ: see ذَرِيعٌ, in two places. ―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  That journeys by night and by day. (K.) ―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  Longtongued with evil speech. (K.)
-A2-  (assumed tropical:)  Good in
social, or familiar, intercourse. (K, TA.)

(S) light, or active, with the hands in spinning:
(S, K:) or one who spins much; who has ability
to do so. (TA.)
ذِرَاعٌ, of a man, (Msb,) [The part] from the
elbow to the extremities of the fingers; (Mgh,
Msb;) the fore arm; syn. سَاعِدٌ [q. v.; thus
corresponding to the سَاق of the leg]: (Lth, K:)
and (tropical:)  [the space] from the extremity of the elbow
to the extremity of the middle finger: (M, Mgh, *
K: [in the last of which, the space is plainly
shown to be meant, like as the part is shown in
the Msb to be meant in the explanation cited
above from that work and the Mgh: see also
جَرِيبٌ:]) in both these senses, sometimes masc.,
(K,) accord. to Kh: (TA:) J says, (TA,) as
relating to the arm, it is masc. and fem.; but Sb
says that it is fem.: (S, TA:) [Mtr says,] it is
fem.: (Mgh:) [Fei says,] the measure so called
is in most instances fem.: accord. to ISk, it is
fem.; but some of the Arabs make it masc.: Fr
says that it is fem.; but that some of [the tribe
named] 'Okl make it masc.: As did not know an
instance of its being masc.: and Zj says that such
an instance is extr.; not choice: (Msb:) the
measure thus called, [i. e. the cubit,] (Msb,) the
ذِرَاعٌ مُكَسَّرَة [or cubit which is divided into fractions], (Mgh,) is six قَبَضَات [or fists] (Mgh,
Msb) of middling measure; (Msb;) and this is
called ذِرَاعُ العَمَامَّةِ [the cubit of the common people,
or the common cubit], because it wants one قَبْضَة
[or fist] of what is called ذِرَاعُ المَلِكِ [the cubit of
the king], namely one of the Kisràs, (Mgh, Msb,)
not the last of them, whose ذراع was seven قَبَضَات:
(Mgh:) [see also مِيلٌ: it is also an astronomical
measure; and as such, it seems, from several
instances in which it is mentioned by Kzw and
other writers, to be, probably, by rule, two
degrees; nearly the half, or quarter, of the length
assigned in different instances to the measure termed
رُمْحٌ; but, like the latter, not precise nor uniform
in every instance:] the dim. is ↓ ذُرِيَّعَةٌ, with ة
because it is fem.; (TA;) or ↓ ذُرَيْعٌ [or ↓ ذُرَيِّعٌ,
without ة, accord. to those who make it masc.]:
(L voce حَرْبٌ:) the pl. is أَذْرُعٌ and ذُرْعَانٌ; (O,
Msb, K;) or, accord. to Sb, the former only;
(S, Msb;) and Sb adds, they have given it this
form of pl. because it is fem.; meaning, that
فِعَالٌ and فُعَالٌ and فَعِيلٌ, when fem., have the pl.
of the measure أَفْعُلٌ. (TA.) In the phrase
الثَّوْبُ سَبْعٌ فِى ثَمَانِيَةٍ [The garment, or piece of
cloth, is seven cubits by eight spans], they say
سبع because أَذْرُع is fem., and ثمانية because أَشْبَار
is masc.; (S; [and the like is said in the Mgh;])
and because the length is measured by the ذراع,
and the breadth by the شِبْر. (S in art. ثمن.)
ذِرَاعٌ is also used as an epithet, applied to a masc.
n.: thus they say, هٰذَا ثَوْبٌ ذِرَاعٌ [This is a garment, or piece of cloth, a cubit in length]. (Kh.)
You say also, هُوَ مِنِّى عَلَى حَبْلِ الذِّرَاعِ It is
prepared, or made ready, on my part: (S:) and
هُوَ لَكَ عَلَى حَبْلِ الذِّرَاعِ I will pay it to thee in
ready money: or it is prepared, or made ready,
for thee: the حبل being a certain vein in the
ذراع. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence several tropical significations:] see ذَرْعٌ, in six places: and see also ذَرَاعٌ.
―
-b3-  Hence also, (Z, TA,) (tropical:)  The instrument with
which one measures the length of the ذراع [or
cubit], (S, Z, O, Mgh, K,) made of a piece of
wood, (Mgh,) or whether it be iron or a rod of
wood. (O, K.) ―
-b4-  [Hence also,] (assumed tropical:)  A sleeve: as in
the phrase ثَوْبٌ مُوَشَّى الذِّرَاعِ (assumed tropical:)  [a garment, or
piece of cloth, variegated, or figured, in the
sleeve]: pl. ↓ مَذَارِعُ, a pl. not agreeing with its
sing., like مَلَامِحُ and مَحَاسِنُ. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Of the
fore legs of bulls or cows, and of sheep or goats,
[The arm; i. e.] the part above the كُرَاع: and of
the fore legs of camels and horses and mules and
asses, [likewise the arm; i. e.] the part above
the وَظِيف: (K:) [also the arm-bone of any of the
animals here mentioned:] accord. to Lth, (TA,)
of any animal, [but this is by synecdoche, (assumed tropical:)  the
fore leg;] i. q. يَدٌ; (Msb, TA;) applying to the
whole of whatever is called thus: (TA:) [thus,
again, corresponding to سَاقٌ; this latter term, in
like manner, having a proper and a synecdochical
acceptation. Hence the prov.] لَا تُطْعِمِ العَبْدَ
الكُرَاعَ فَيَطْمَعَ فِى الذِّرَاعِ [Feed not thou the slave
with the shank, lest he covet the arm]. (K.) ―
-b6-
[Hence,] الذِّرَاعُ, also called ذِرَاعُ الأَسَد (assumed tropical:)  Two
bright stars, which are one of the Mansions of the
Moon: (S:) [there are two asterisms thus called;
together, الذِّرَعَانِ: one of them is] الذِّرَاعُ المَبْسُوطَةُ,
[also called ذِرَاعُ الأَسَدِ المَبْسُوطَةُ,] the two bright
stars [
α and
β] in the heads of Gemini: (Kzw in
his description of Gemini:) [the other is called
الذِّرَاعُ المَقْبُوضَةُ, and] ذِرَاعُ الأَسَدِ المَقْبُوضَةُ, the
two bright stars [
α and
β] of Canis Minor:
(Kzw in his description of Canis Minor:) [hence
it appears that the ancient Arabs, or many of
them, extended the figure of Leo (as they did
also that of Scorpio) far beyond the limits which
we assign to it: the former ذراع accord. to those
who make النَّوْءُ to signify “ the auroral rising,”
but the latter accord. to those who make it to
signify “ the auroral setting,” is the Seventh
Mansion of the Moon: the following descriptions
in Kzw's account of the Mansions of the Moon,
and in the O and K and TA, are obscure and
inaccurate:] الذِّرَاعُ is one of the Mansions of the
Moon, (O, Kzw, K,) and is called ذراع الاسد
المقبوضة, (O, Kzw,) or ذراع الاسد المبسوطة:
(K:) the lion has a ذراع which is مبسوطة and a
ذراع which is مقبوضة, (O, Kzw, K,) and this is
the one next to Syria, (O, K,) or on the left,
(Kzw,) and in it the moon has a mansion; the
مبسوطة being next to El-Yemen, (O, K,) or on
the right; (Kzw;) [but this description of their
relative positions should be reversed, as is shown
by what precedes and by what follows;] each
being two stars, between which is the measure of
a سَوْط [or whip]; (O;) and the latter is higher
in the sky, and more extended, than the other,
(O, K,) wherefore it is called مبسوطة; (O;) and
sometimes the moon deviates, and so has a mansion
in it: (O, K:) [it is said in the TA that الذراع is
also a name of one of the asterisms (نُجُوم) of
الجَوْزَآء; but this is the same that is called the
مبسوطة:] it rises [at dawn] on the fourth of تَمُّوز
[or July O. S.], and sets [at dawn] on the fourth
of كَانُون الآخِر [or January, O. S.]: (O, Kzw:
[and so in the K, except that in this last, it is
erroneously said to set in كَانُون الأَوَّل:]) so says
IKt: but Ibráheem El-Harbee says that it rises on
the seventh of تمّوز, and sets on the sixth of كانون
الآخر. (O, TA.) [See مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل;
and see also نَوْءٌ, and نَكْبَآءُ.] The rhyming prosaist
of the Arabs says, إِذَا طَلَعَتِ الذِّرَاعْ حَسَرَتِ الشَّمْسُ
القِنَاعْ وَاسْتَعْلَتْ فِى الأُفُقِ الشُّعَاعْ وَ تَرَقْرَقَ السَّرَابُ فِى
كُلِّ قَاعْ [When the Dhiráa rises at dawn, the
sun puts off the veil, and the rays ascend in the
horizon, and the mirage flickers, or glistens, in
every plain]. (TA.) And the Arabs assert that
when there is no rain [at any other season] in the
year, the ذراع does not break its promise, though
it be but a بَغْشَة [or weak shower of rain]: (Kzw,
TA:) [or] its نَوْء is approved, and seldom does it
break its promise. (Kzw.) ―
-b7-  ذِرَاعٌ also signifies
(assumed tropical:)  A certain mark made with a hot iron upon the
arm (ذراع) of a camel: (S, K:) and is a mark of
the Benoo-Thaalebeh in El-Yemen, and of some
persons of the Benoo-Málik-Ibn-Saad. (K.) ―
-b8-
Also (tropical:)  The fore part of a spear or spear-shaft:
(K, TA:) this is called (S, TA) also (TA)
ذِرَاعُ الَعَامِلِ. (S, TA.)
ذَرُوعٌ: see what next follows.
ذَرِيعٌ Wide in step, (S, K,) and light, or active,
in pace, or going; (K;) applied to a horse, (S,
K,) and to a camel; as also ↓ ذَرُوعٌ: (K:) and
quick: (S, Msb, K:) [and so ↓ ذَرِعٌ; for] ↓ ذَرِعَاتٌ,
(S, O, K,) applied to the legs of a quadruped
(قَوَائِمٌ), (S, TA,) signifies quick, (S, K,) wide in
step, taking much of the ground: (O, K:) or, as
some say, this last word signifies the legs of a
beast, (TA,) like ↓ مَذَارِعُ, (S, K,) pl. of مِذْرَاعٌ.
(K.) It is said of Mohammad, in a trad., كَانَ
ذَرِيعَ المَشْىِ (assumed tropical:)  He was quick, and wide of step, in
