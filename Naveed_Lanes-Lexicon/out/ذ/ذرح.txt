(Kr,) [The cantharis, or Spanish fly;] a kind of
insect of a red colour, (S, A, K,) spotted, or
speckled, with black, which flies, (S, K,) and is
of a poisonous nature; (S, K;) a kind of insect
larger than the common fly, variegated with red
and black and yellow, having a pair of wings
with which it flies, and of a deadly poisonous
nature: when they desire to allay the heat of its
poison, they mix it with lentils, and so mixed it
becomes a remedy for him who has been bitten
by a mad dog: (IO:) Ibn-Ed-Dahhán the Lexicologist says that the ذرّوح is a kind of fly variegated with yellow and white; and what is called
فَرْخَةُ الدَّيْلَمِ: by certain of the acute physicians
it is described as حَيَوَانٌ دُودِىٌّ, app. meaning
a worm-like animal, of the size of the finger, and
of a conical shape, the head of which is at the
thickest part of it: and IDrst says that it is a
flying insect, resembling the زُنْبُور [or hornet],
and of a deadly poisonous nature. (TA.) It is
observed in the S, with reference to ذُرُّوحٌ, that,
in the opinion of Sb, لَيْسَ فِى الكَلَامِ فُعَّوْلٌ بِوَاحِدَةٌ;
meaning, there is not in the language a subst.
(as distinguished from an epithet) of the measure
فُعَّوْلٌ; (marg. note in a copy of the S;) or his
meaning is, [there is not a word of this measure]
with damm alone; (MF;) or with a single
dammeh, that is, to the ف; but with dammeh to
the ف and to the ع: (IB:) and it is added in
the S, that he (Sb) used to say سَبُّوحٌ and قَدُّوسٌ:
Sb, however, also mentions the forms سُبُّوحٌ and
قُدُّوسٌ. (MF.) The pl. is ذَرَايِحُ: (S, K:) in
the L, ذُرَّاحٌ is also said to be a pl.: and Kr
mentions ذَرَارِحُ; but AHát says that this last is
only used in poetry. (TA.) Sb says that the
sing. of ذَرَارِيحُ is ذُرَحْرَحٌ, (or, in other words, that
one of the [insects called] ذراريح is [called]
ذرحرح,) which is of the measure فُعَلْعَلٌ, and of
which the dim. is ↓ ذُرَيْرِحٌ, formed by throwing
out the first ذُريْرِحٌ; [not ح, as it would be by
rule, making it of the measure ذُرَيْحِرٌ, and its
curtailed original فُعَيْلِعٌ;] for there is not in the
language a word of the measure فعلع, except
فعلع, (S,) which is the proper name of a man.
(MF.) AHát cites a verse in which حَدْرَدٌ occurs
as pl. of ذَرَانِحُ; but the correct reading is ذرنوح.
