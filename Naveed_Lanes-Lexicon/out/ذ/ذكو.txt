ذَكَتِ النَّارُ, (S, K, &c.,) aor. تَذْكُو, (S,)
inf. n. ذَكًا (S, Mgh, K, &c.) and ذَكَآءٌ accord. to
Z (K) and ذُكُوٌّ, (M, K, TA,) like عُلُوٌّ; (TA;

the primary signification of the root, which is
“ completeness. ” (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  ذَكَا المِسْكُ The
mush gave forth odour, or fragrance; (MA;)
[or a strong, or pungent, odour; for] the primary
signification of ذَكًا in relation to odour is the
being strong, [or pungent,] in sweetness or in
fetidness. (TA.) ―
-b3-  ذَكِىَ, aor. يَذْكَى; (S, Msb,
K) and ذَكَا, (Msb, K,) aor. يَذْكَى, (K,) or
يَذْكُو; (Msb;) and ذَكُوَ, (MA, K,) aor. يَذْكُو;
(K;) all three mentioned by ISd; (TA;) inf. n.
ذَكَآء; (S, MA, K, * TA; [in my copy of the Msb,
the inf. n. of the first is said to be ذَكًى; but this
is app. a mistranscription; or the author perhaps
held ذَكًى, more properly written ذَكًا, to be the
inf. n.; for he says that ذَكِىَ is of the class of
تَعِبَ, of which the inf. n. is تَعَبٌ, and afterwards
mentions ذَكَآءُ as though he held this to be a
simple subst.;]) said of a man, (S, Msb,) He
was, or became, sharp, or acute, in mind, (S,
TA,) with quickness of perception, and of intelligence, understanding, sagacity, skill, or knowledge: (TA:) or quick of understanding, (Msb,
K,) or intelligence, sagacity, skill, or knowledge:
(K:) or quick of perception, and sharp, or acute,
in understanding: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or quick in
drawing conclusions. (TA. [See ذَكَآءُ, below.])
[Also, app., said of a camel, and the like, meaning
He was, or became, sharp in spirit. See ذَكِىٌّ.]
-A2-  [ذَكَا seems to have been also used by some as
meaning He (a beast) was, or became, legalty
slaughtered; and consequently, legally clean: or
to have been supposed to have this signification.
―
-b2-  And hence,] أَيُّمَا أَرْضٍ جَفَّتْ فَقَدْ ذَكَتْ means
(assumed tropical:)  Whatever ground has become dry, it has become
clean, or pure: but [Mtr, after mentioning this,
adds,] I have not found it in the lexicons. (Mgh.
[See also ذَكَاةٌ, below.])

ذكّى النَّارَ, (T, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَذْكِيَةٌ, (S,
TA,) He made the fire to blaze or flame, to burn
up, or to burn brightly or fiercely; (T, S, K;) as
also ↓ اذكاها: (S, K:) or he supplied the fire
fully with fuel: (Msb, TA:) and السِّرَاجَ ↓ اذكى
He lighted the lamp. (Har p. 53.) ―
-b2-  [ذكّى العَقْلَ,
and ذكّى alone, said of a medicine &c., It sharpened the intellect.]
-A2-  ذكّى, (Mgh, Msb,) inf. n.
as above, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) He slaughtered
(S, Mgh, Msb, K) an animal, (Mgh,) or a camel
and the like, (Msb,) in the manner [prescribed by
the law,] termed ذَبْحٌ, (S, Mgh, K,) i. e., (Mgh,
K,) in the manner termed ذَكَاةٌ [q. v. infrà].
(Mgh, Msb, K.) The proper signification of
التَّذْكِيَةُ is The causing the natural heat to pass
forth: but it is peculiarly applied in the law to
signify the destroying of life in a particular
manner, exclusive of any other manner. (Er-Rághib, TA.) إِلَّا مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ, in the Kur [v. 4],
means Except that whereof ye shall attain to the
ذَكَاة [or slaughter in the manner prescribed by
the law] (Bd, Msb, TA) said of a man, (S,)
He became old, or advanced in age, (S, K,) and
big-bodied, or corpulent: (K:) [or he attained to
full growth or age: said of a man, and of a horse
and the like:] see ذَكَآءٌ, last sentence. [See also
مُذَكٍّ, below.])

-b2-  [Hence,] أَذْكَيْتُ
الحَرْبَ (assumed tropical:)  I kindled war. (TA.) ―
-b3-  أَذْكَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ
العُيُونَ I sent against him the scouts. (S.)

إِسْتَذْكَوَ see 1, first sentence. ―
-b2-  [Hence, app.,]
استذكى الفَحْلُ عَلَى الأُنْثَى (assumed tropical:)  The stallion pressed vehemently upon the female. (TA.)
ذَكًا an inf. n. of 1; The blazing, or flaming,
&c., of fire. (S, K, &c. [See 1, first sentence.])
―
-b2-  See also ذُكْوَةٌ.
-A2-  And see ذَكَاةٌ.
ذَكٍ a possessive epithet: (ISd, TA:) you say
نَارٌ ذَكِيَةٌ, (K, TA,) without teshdeed, (TA, [in
the CK ذَكِيَّةٌ,]) A fire blazing, or flaming, &c.
(K, TA.)
ذَكَاةٌ: see ذُكْوَةٌ.
-A2-  [Also] a subst. (Mgh,
Msb, TA) syn. with تَذْكِيَةٌ (Mgh, Msb, K, TA)
as signifying ذَبْحٌ [i. e. The slaughter of an animal
for food in the manner prescribed by the law];
(Mgh, K, TA;) as also ↓ ذَكًا, (K, TA, [in the
CK ذَكاء,) which is likewise said to be a simple
subst.: (TA: [in the TK, ذَكًا and ذَكَاةٌ are both
said to be inf. ns., of which the verb is ذَكَا,
signifying ذَبَحَ; but this I do not find in any
lexicon of authority:]) it is satisfactorily performed by the severing of the windpipe and gullet,
as is related on the authority of Ahmad [Ibn-
Hambal], or, as is also related on his authority,
by severing them an also the وَدَجَانِ, [or two
external jugular veins], less than which is not
lawful; or, accord to A boo-Haneefeh, the severing
of the windpipe and gullet and one of the ودجان;
or, accord. to Málik, the severing of the أَوَدَاج [or
external jugular veins] though it be without the
severing of the windpipe. (Msb.) The saying
ذَكَاةُ الجَنِينِ ذَكَاةُ أُمِّهِ is for ذَكَاةُ الجَنِينِ هِىَ
ذَكَاةُ أُمِّهِ [The legal slaughter of the fœtus, or young
in the belly, it is the legal slaughter of its mother]:
(Msb, TA:) or it is an instance of the transposition of the inchoative and enunciative, (Mgh,
Msb,) its implied meaning being ذَكَاةُ أُمِّ الجَنِينِ
ذَكَاةٌ لَهُ [The legal slaughter of the mother of the
fœtus, or young in the belly, is a legal slaughter
of it also; so that the latter, like the former, may
be lawfully eaten]; (Msb;) i. e., when she is
legally slaughtered, it is legally slaughtered:
(TA:) the use of the accus. case (Mgh, TA) in
the like thereof, (Mgh,) [or] in the phrase ذكاة
امّه, [i. e., the saying ذَكَاةَ أُمِّهِ,] is a mistake.
(Mgh, TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence the saying of Mohammad
Ibn-El-Hanafeeyeh, ذَكَاةُ الأَرْضِ يُبْسُهُا (assumed tropical:)  [The
cleanness, or purity, of the ground is its becoming
dry]; i. e., when it becomes dry from the moisture
of uncleanness, it becomes clean, like as a beast
becomes clean by means of legal slaughter. (Mgh.
[See also 1, last sentence.])
ذُكْوَةٌ, (T, TA, &c.,) with damm, not ذَكْوَةٌ as
the text of the K indicates it to be (TA) [and as
it is written in the copies thereof], and ذُكْيَةٌ,
(S, TA,) also with damm, (TA,) [in the copies of
the K ذَكْيَة,] What is thrown upon the fire,
(T, S, K, *) of firewood, or of camel's or similar
dung, (T,) to make it blaze, or flame, or burn
up, or burn brightly or fiercely. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  Also
the former, A blazing, or flaming, coal of fire;
and so ↓ ذَكًا, (K, TA,) with the short ا, on the
authority of IDrd; [in the CK ذَكَاء;] or, as in
the M, ↓ ذَكَاةٌ. (TA.)
ذَكْوَانٌ A kind of trees: n. un. with ة: (IAar,
TA:) the pl. of the latter is ذَكَاوِينُ, and signifies small [trees of the kind called] سَرْح [q. v.].
(M, K, TA. [In the CK, السَّرْج is erroneously
put for السَّرْح.])
ذَكَآءُ Sharpness, or acuteness, of mind, (S,
Msb, TA,) with quickness of perception, and of
intelligence, understanding, sagacity, skill, or
knowledge: (TA:) or completeness of intelligence, with quickness of apprehension: (Msb:)
or quickness of intelligence, understanding, sagacity, skill, or knowledge: (K:) or quickness of
perception, and sharpness, or acuteness, of understanding: thus applied, it is like the phrase
فُلَانٌ شُعْلَةُ نَارٍ: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or quickness
in drawing conclusions. (TA. [See ذِهْنٌ: and
see also 1.]) [It app. signifies also Sharpness of
spirit; as a quality of a camel and the like.
See ذَكِىٌّ.] ―
-b2-  Also Age: (S, K:) or full, or
complete, age: so says Mbr in the “ Kámil: ”
(TA:) contr. of فَتَآءٌ: (Ham p. 217:) accord. to
Az, its primary signification, universally, is a
state of completeness: and الذَّكَآءُ فِى السِّنّ means
completeness of age: accord. to Kh, it means the
age of completeness of strength, [app. in a horse,
or any solid-hoofed animal, for he says that it is]
when a year has passed after the قُرُوح [or
finishing of teething]: (TA:) or ذَكَآءُ السِّنِّ
means the utmost term of youthfulness; from the
primary signification of the root, which is “ a
state of completeness. ” (Mgh.) Hence the saying
of El-Hajjáj, فُرِرْتُ عَنْ ذَكَآءٍ [I have been examined as to age; app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  my abilities
have been tested and proved]: and بَلَغَتِ الدَّابَّةُ
الذَّكَآءَ The beast attained to [fulness of] age
(S, TA.) [Hence, also,] one says, فَتَآ فُلَانٍ
كَذَكَآءِ فُلَانٍ and فُلَانٍ ↓ كَتَذْكِيَةِ [The youthfulness of such a one is like the fulness of age of
such a one], i. e., the prudence, or discretion, of
such a one notwithstanding his deficiency of age
is like the prudence, or discretion, of such a one
with his fulness of age. (Ham p. 217.)
ذُكَآءُ, imperfectly decl., The sun: (S, K:)
determinate, and not admitting the article ال:
you say, هٰذِهِ ذُكَآءُ طَالِعَةٌ [This is the sun rising]:
(S:) derived from ذَكَتِ النَّارُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence,
(S,) اِبْنُ ذُكَآءَ The dawn, or daybreak: (S, K:)
because it is from the light of the sun. (S.)
Homeyd says, [or, accord. to some, Besheer
Ibn-En-Nikth, as in one of my copies of the S,
in art. كفر,]
فَوَرَدَتْ قَبْلَ انْبِلَاجِ الفَجْرِ
وَابْنُ ذُكَآءَ كَامِنٌ فِى الكَفْرِ
[And she, or they, came to the water before the
bright shining of the daybreak, while the dawn
lay kid in the darkness of night]. (S.)
ذَكِىٌّ, applied to musk, and so ذَكِيَّةٌ, (K, TA,)
for مِسْكٌ, as is said by IAmb, is both masc. and
fem., and so is عَنْبَرٌ, (TA,) and ↓ ذَاكٍ, Diffusing
odour: (K:) or having a strong [or pungent]
odour. (TA. [See 1, second sentence.]) You
say also رَائِحَةٌ ذَكِيَّةٌ A sharp [or pungent, or a
strong,] odour [whether sweet or fetid]; syn. حَادَّةٌ.
(K in art. حد.) ―
-b2-  Applied to a man, Having
the attribute, or quality, termed ذَكَآء, (S, Msb,
K,) as meaning sharpness, or acuteness, (S, Msb,)
or quickness, (K,) of mind, (S, Msb,) or of intel-ligence, &c.: (K, TA, &c.:) pl. أَذْكِيَآءُ. (Msb,
TA.) It is also, sometimes, applied to a camel
[or the like, as meaning Sharp in spirit: see
فُؤَادٌ]. (TA.)
-A2-  Also i. q. ذَبِيحٌ [meaning
Slaughtered in the manner prescribed by the
law, termed ذَبْحٌ and ذَكَاةٌ]: (K:) it is of the
measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ:
(Msb:) and [therefore] you say شَاةٌ ذَكِىٌّ, meaning [a sheep, or goat, slaughtered in the manner
above mentioned; and also,] to whose ذَكَاة [or
slaughter in that manner] one has attained
[while life yet remained therein: see 2]: (Mgh,
Msb:) ذَكِيَّةٌ [as its fem.] is extr. [like ذَبِيحَةٌ].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, جِلْدٌ ذَكِىٌّ (tropical:)  A skin stripped
from an animal that has been slaughtered in the
manner mentioned above. (Mgh.)
ذَاكٍ: see the next preceding paragraph.
مُذْكٍ; and the fem., مُذْكِيَةٌ: see the following
paragraph, in three places.
مُذَكٍّ, applied to a man, (TA,) Old, or advanced
in age, and big-bodied, or corpulent: (K, TA:)
[or full-grown, or of full age: see ذَكَآءٌ:] or an
old man, but only such as is much experienced
and disciplined: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and accord.
to ISd, anything [i. e. any animal] old, or advanced in age: by some especially applied to a
solid-hoofed animal; and said to mean one that
has passed the قُرُوح [or finishing of teething] by
a year: (TA:) or مَذَاكٍ, (S, K, TA,) which is
its pl., (S, TA,) [(like as مُذَكِّيَاتٌ is pl. of the
fem.,) and also pl. of its syn. ↓ مُذْكٍ,] signifies,
applied to horses, (S, K, TA,) of generous race,
advanced in age, (TA,) that have passed a year,
or two years, after their قُرُوح: (S, K, TA:) the
sing. is like مُخْلِفٌ applied to a camel: (S, TA:)
or مُذَكٍّ signifies a horse of full age and of complete strength; as also ↓ مُذْكٍ: (Ham p. 217:)
or a horse whose run becomes spent (يَذْهِبُ), and
[then, but not before he has exhausted his power,]
stops. (TA.) It is said in a prov., جَرْىُ
المُذَكِّيَاتُ غِلَابٌ [The running of the horses that
have attained to their full age and strength is a
contending for superiority]: (Meyd, and so in
some copies of the S:) it may mean that the
horse in this case contends for superiority with
him that runs with him; or that his second run
is always more than his first, and his third than
his second: (Meyd:) or, as some relate it, غِلَآءٌ;
(Meyd, and so in other copies of the S in this
art., and in the S and K in art غلو;) meaning
that the running of such horses is several bowshots: (Meyd, and S and K in art. غلو:) it is
applied to him who is described as entering into
contests for excellence with his compeers. (Meyd.)
―
-b2-  [Hence,] ↓ سَحَابَةٌ مُذْكِيَةٌ, (K,) or, as in the
Tekmileh, مُذَكِّيَةٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  A cloud that has
rained time after time. (K, TA.)
