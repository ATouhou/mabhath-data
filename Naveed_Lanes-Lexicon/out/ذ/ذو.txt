ذوذُو meaning صَاحِب [i. e. A possessor, an
owner, a lord, or a master, but often better rendered having, possessing, possessed of, or endowed
with], (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K, but omitted in
the CK,) used as a prefixed noun, (S, Mgh, Msb,
&c.,) is originally ذَوًا, like عَصًا, the ا being
changed from و; (S;) or it is originally ذَوَّى;
and if one used it as a proper name, he would
say, هٰذَا ذَوَّىقَدْ جَآءَ [This is Dhawà, he has
come]; (M;) [not ذَوًا, as in copies of the S; i. e.,]
its third radical letter is ى, not, as J says,
و; this ى being afterwards suppressed; (IB;)
[so that the word becomes ذَوٌ, and then, by reason
of its being prefixed to another noun, ذُو, like as
أَبَوٌ, the original form of أَبٌ, becomes أَبُو:] it is
declined [like أَبُو] with و and | and ىِ; (Msb;)
[i. e.,] the nom. case is ذُو, accus. ذَا, and gen.
ذِى: (Mgh:) the fem. is ذَاتُ; (T, S, M, Mgh,
Msb, K; in a copy of the M, ذاة, and the CK,
ذَاةٌ [as though it were not a prefixed noun];) and
in the case of a pause, some say ذَاتْ, and others
say ذَاهْ: (Lth, T: the latter usage, only, is mentioned in the S:) dual. masc., ذَوَا, (S, * M,)
[accus and gen. ذَوَىْ;] fem. ذَوَاتَا, (T, M, Mgh,
Msb, K,) for which ذَاتَا is allowable in poetry,
but ذَوَاتَا is better, (T,) [accus, and gen. ذَوَاتَىْ:]
pl., masc., ذَوُو, (T, *, S, * M, Msb, K, but omitted
in the CK,) [accus, and gen. ذَوِى;] fem. ذَوَاتُ,
(T, S, * M, Mgh, Msb, K,) accus. and gen. ذَوَاتِ;
(S;) and أُولُو and أُولَات are like ذَوُو and ذَوَات
[in signification]. (T. [See art. الو.]) In this
sense it is not used otherwise than as a prefixed
noun: when used to characterize an indeterminate
noun, prefixed to an indeterminate noun; and
when used to characterize a determinate noun,
prefixed to [a noun rendered determinate by] the
article ال. (S.) [Thus you say رَجُلٌ ذُو مَالٍ A
man a possessor of wealth; and الرَّجُلُ ذُو المَالِ
The man the possessor of wealth.] In the phrase
غَيْرَ ذَاتِ الشَوْكَةِ [Not those possessed of weapons,
&c.], in the Kur [viii. 7], the fem. form is used
as meaning the طَائِفَة [or party]. (T.) صَارَ ذَا ذَنْبٍ
[He became one having a sin, or crime, &c.,
attributable to him, i. e. he had a sin, &c., attributable to him,] means تَحَمَّلَ ذَنْبًا [he became
chargeable with a sin, &c.]. (Msb in art. ذنب.)
―
-b2-  Accord. to the S, it is not prefixed to a pronoun (مُضْمَر); nor to a proper name, such as زَيْد
and عَمْرو and the like: but there are several
instances of its being prefixed, in its pl. form, to
a pronoun; among which is the saying of a poet,
إِنَّمَا يَصْطَنِعُ المَعْرُوفُ فِى النَّاسِ ذَوُوهُ
[Only they who are possessors thereof do that
which is good among men]: (TA:) [this usage,
however, is perhaps only allowable by poetic
license: see another ex. (also here cited in the
TA) in the Ham p. 442, and the remarks there
appended to it:] and it is also prefixed to proper
names, as is shown by the phrase, (TA,) هٰذَا ذُو
زَيْدٍ (M, K, TA,) mentioned, as heard from the
Arabs, by Ahmad Ibn-Ibráheem, the preceptor of
Th, meaning This is Zeyd, (M, TA,) i. e., this is
the owner of the name Zeyd; (M, K, TA;) and
[perhaps] by the name ذُو الخَلَصَةِ, for الخلصة is
[said by some to be] the name of a certain idol,
and ذو is a metonymical appellation of its بَيْت;
and by the proper names ذُو رُعَيْنٍ and ذُو يَزَنَ and
[accord. to some] ذُو جَدْنٍ [and the like, of which
several are mentioned in the S, as well as in the
M &c.]. (IB, TA.) [But see a later portion
of this paragraph, where, prefixed to a proper
name, it is said to be redundant.] ―
-b3-  ذَوُو الأَرْحَام,
[or, as in the Kur viii. last verse, and xxxiii. 6,
أُولُو الأَرْحَامِ, pls. of ذُو الرَّحِمِ,] in the classical
language, means [The possessors of relationship;
i. e.] any relations: and in law, any relations that
have no portion [of the inheritances termed فَرَائِض]
and are not [such heirs as are designated by the
appellation] عَصَبَة [q. v.: they are so called because they are relations by the women's side: see
رَحِمٌ]. (KT, TA.) ―
-b4-  If you form a pl. from
ذُومَالٍ, you say, هٰؤُلَآءِ ذَوُونَ [These are possessors
of wealth]; because in this case the pl. is not a
prefixed noun. (S.) Accord. to Lth, الذَّوُونَ
signifies The former, or first, [of persons,] and
the more, or most, distinguished. (T, TA. *)
Also, (S, M,) and الأَذْوَآءُ, [which is another pl.
of ذُو,] (S,) The kings (S, M) of El-Yemen, of
the tribe of Kudá'ah, (S,) whose surnames commenced with ذُو, (M,) [i. e.] who were named [or
rather surnamed] (S) ذُو يَزَنَ (S, M) and ذُو جَدَنٍ
and ذُو نُوَاسٍ (S) and the like. (S, M.) قُرَشِىٌّ
لَيْسَ مِنْ ذِى وَلَا ذُو, occurring in a trad., means
A Kurashee in respect of lineage, not of the
أَذْوَآء [above mentioned]. (TA.) ―
-b5-  [ذُو and ذَات
and ذَا and ذِى are also used as prefixed nouns
in various expressions here following, in several
thereof as meaning Something in possession, or the
like; not a possessor: or, in these instances, as is
said in explanation of the first of the following
phrases, and also of the phrase ذَاتُ اليَدِ (mentioned below) in Har p. 93, that which is contained
is made to be as though it were the possessor
(صَاحِب) of that which contains.] ―
-b6-  مَوَّتَ ذَابَطْنِهَا
[He killed what was in her belly]. (Har ubi
suprá.) And وَضَعَتِ المَرْأَةُ ذَا بَطْنِهَا, (T,) or ذَاتَ
بَطْنِهَا, (TA,) The woman brought forth [her
child]. (T, TA.) And نَثَرَتْ ذَا بَطْنِهَا She brought
forth many children. (T in art. نثر; and Mgh
there and in the present art., in the latter of which
it is added that the usual phrase is نَثَرَتْ بَطْنَهَا.)
And أَلْقَتِ الدَّجَاجَةُ ذَا بَطْنِهَا The hen laid her egg,
or eggs: or muted. (Mgh.) And أَلْقَى الرَّجُلُ ذَا
بَطْنِهِ The man ejected his excrement, or ordure.
(T.) And الذِّئْبُ مَغْبُوطٌ بِذِى بَطْنِهِ The wolf is
envied [for what is in his belly, or] for his distention of the belly [with food]. (TA.) ―
-b7-  [In
like manner,] ذَاتُ اليَدِ means (tropical:)  Wealth; as though
it were the possessor of that which contains it:
(Har ubi suprá:) [or what is in the possession of
the hand:] or what one possesses, of wealth;
because gained by the hand and disposed of by
the hand. (Har p. 66.) You say, قَلَّتْ ذَاتُ يَدِهِ
(assumed tropical:)  What his hand possessed became little in quantity; (Lth, T;) or the possessions accompanying
his hand; (Mgh;) app. meaning his riches.
(Lth, T.) ―
-b8-  ذَاتُ الرِّئَةِ and ذَاتُ الجَنْبِ are Two
well-known diseases. (TA. [See arts. رأى and
جنب.]) ―
-b9-  عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ, in the Kur iii. 115,
means [Acquainted, or well acquainted,] with
what is in the minds: (Ksh, Bd, Jel: [and the
like is indicated in the Mgh:]) or with the true,
or real, nature of the notions that are concealed
in the minds: (IAmb, T:) or with the hidden
things of the minds: or with the minds themselves.
(Msb. [If the last meaning be correct, the phrase
should be mentioned with others later in this
paragraph.]) [And similar to this is the saying,]
عَرَفَهُ مِنْ ذَاتِ نَفْسِهِ He knew it from what he
conceived in his mind [without his being informed
thereof; i. e. he knew it of himself]. (Lth, T.)
And جَآءَ مِنْ ذِىنَفْسِهِ and مِنْ ذَاتِ نَفْسِهِ (M,
K) He came [from a motive in his own mind;
of himself;] of his own accord; or willingly;
syn. طَيِّعًا: (M, TA:) in the copies of the K,
طَبْعًا; but the former is the right explanation.
(TA.) And مَا كَلَّمْتُ فُلَانًا ذَاتَ شَفَةٍ and ذَاتَ فَمٍ
I spoke not to such a one a word. (AZ, T.) ―
-b10-
ذَاتَ اليَمِينِ and ذَاتَ الشِّمَالِ [are adverbial expressions, and] mean In the direction of the right
hand and of the left: properly in the direction
that has the name of the right hand [and that has
the name of the left hand]. (Bd in xviii. 16.)
And أَتَيْنَا ذَا يَمِينٍ means We came on the right
hand. (TA.) ―
-b11-  ذَاتَ مَرَّةٍ and ذَا صَبَاحٍ [also, and
the like,] are adverbial expressions, which may
not be used otherwise than as such: (S:) you say,
لَقِيتُهُ ذَاتَ مَرَّةٍ [I met him once, or once upon a
time], (S,) and ذَاتَ المِرَارِ many times, (M and K
in art. مر,) or sometimes, (S in that art.,) and
ذَاتَ يَوْمٍ (Fr, T, S) i. e. مَرَّةً فِى يَوْمٍ [once upon a
day, or one day], therefore you use the fem. form,
(T,) and ذَاتَ لَيْلَةٍ [one night], (Fr, T, S,) and
ذَاتَ غَدَاةٍ [one morning, or one morning between
daybreak and sunrise], and ذَاتَ العِشَآءِ [once in
the evening at nightfall], (S,) meaning, accord.
to Th, in the hour, or time, in which is nightfall,
(T,) and ذَاتَ الزُّمَيْنِ (Fr, T, S) [some time ago,
or] three [or more, to ten,] seasons ago, (مُذْ ثَلَاثَةُ
أَزْمَانٍ, T, [by ازمان being app. meant periods of
two, or three, or six, months,]) and ذَاتَ العُوَيْمِ
(Fr, T, S) [some years ago, or] three years ago
(T,) or three years ago or more, to ten; (Az
on the authority of AZ, TA in art. عوم;) and
ذَا صَبَاحٍ [one morning], and ذَا مَسَآءٍ [one evening],
(T, S,) and ذَا صَبُوحٍ [lit, at a time of drinking
the morning-draught], and ذَا غَبُوقٍ [lit. at a time
of drinking the evening-draught]; in these four
instances without ة: and this mode of expression
has been heard only in the cases of the times here
mentioned: they did not say ذَاتَ شَهْرٍ nor ذَاتَ سَنَةٍ:
(S:) or one may also well say ذَاتَ صَبَاحٍ, like
ذَاتَ يَوْمٍ; for ذا and ذات both mean the time:
and accord. to IAar, one says, أَتَيْتُهُ ذَاتَ الصَّبُوحِ
and ذَاتَ الغَبُوقِ, as meaning I came to him in the
morning, or in the morning between daybreak and
sunrise, and in the evening, or in the evening
between sunset and nightfall. (T.) ―
-b12-  You say
also, لَقِيتُهُ ذَاتَ يَدَيْنِ, (TA,) or لَقِيتُهُ أَوَّلَ ذِى
يَدَيْنِ (M) and ذَاتِ يَدَيْنِ, (AZ, M, Msb, [whence
it seems to be not improbable that the phrase in
the TA is imperfectly transcribed,]) meaning I
met him the first thing, (M,) or first of everything.
(AZ, Msb, TA.) And أَفْعَلُهُ أَوَّلَ ذِى يَدَيْنِ and
ذَاتِ يَدَيْنِ [I will do it the first thing, or first of
everything]. (M.) And أَمَّا أَوَّلَ ذَاتِ يَدَيْنِ فَإِنَّنِى
أَحْمَدُ اللّٰهَ, (AZ, M, Msb,) i. e. [Whatever be the
case, the first thing, or] first of everything, I
praise God. (AZ, Msb.) ―
-b13-  [Respecting the
phrase ذَاتُ البَيْنِ, which has two contr. meanings,
see art. بين. It is inadequately explained in this
art. in the T and M and K, as follows.] وَأَصْلِحُوا
ذَاتَ بَيْنِكُمْ, (T, M, K, *) in the Kur [viii. 1],
accord. to Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà, means [And do
ye rightly dispose, or arrange, or order,] the
case that is between you: (T:) or, accord. to
Zj, (M,) that wherein consists your union;
(حَقِيقَةَ وَصْلِكُمْ, M, K;) i. e. be ye of one accord,
or in unison, respecting that which God and his
Apostle have commanded: (M:) or ذَاتُ البَيْنِ
means the state of circumstances whereby the
Muslims become of one accord, or in unison:
(K:) this is the meaning in the saying, اَللّٰهُمَّ
أَصْلِحْ ذَاتَ البَيْنِ [O God, do Thou rightly dispose &c.]. (M.) ―
-b14-  ذَاتٌ is sometimes used as a
noun independent in its meaning, (Mgh, Msb,)
so as to denote material [or real] things; (Msb;)
and is described by the epithets مُتَمَيِّزَةٌ [or “ distinct ”] (Mgh, Msb) and قَدِيمَةٌ [as meaning
“ that has existed from eternity ”] (Mgh) and
مُحْدَثَةٌ [as meaning “ that has been brought into
existence ”]. (Mgh, Msb.) Thus used, (Msb,)
it signifies The essence of a thing, meaning that
by being which a thing is what it is, or that in
being which a thing consists; or the ultimate and
radical constituent of a thing: and the essence as
meaning the peculiar nature of a thing: syn.
حَقِيقَةٌ, (T, IB, Msb, TA,) and مَاهِيَّةٌ, (Msb,)
and خَاصَّةٌ: (T, IB, TA:) it is also used as
meaning a thing's self: (Mgh, * Msb:) [a man's
self, or person: (see شَخْصٌ:)] and a thing; a
being; anything, whatever it be; every شَىْء being
a ذَات, and every ذات being a شىء: (Aboo-Sa'eed,
Mgh, Msb:) and particularly a substance, or thing
that subsists by itself: [hence اِسْمُ ذَاتٍ meaning
a real substantive; also termed اِسْمُ عَيْنٍ: opposed
to اِسْمُ مَعْنًى, i. e. an ideal substantive:] and
[hence] it signifies also a word that is independent
in its meaning; [i. e. ذَاتٌ (alone), though oftener
used in the sense assigned above to اِسْمُ ذَاتٍ,
signifies also, absolutely, a substantive;] opposed
to صِفَةٌ as signifying a word that is not independent in its meaning. (Kull p. 187.) Its application to God, in the sense of حَقِيقَةٌ and خَاصَّةٌ,
is forbidden by most persons: (TA:) [for]
ذَاتُ اللّٰهِ [as meaning The essence of God], used
by the scholastic theologians, is said to be an
ignorant expression, because the names of God
do not admit the fem. affix ة; so that one does
not apply to Him the epithet عَلَّامَةٌ, though He
is the all-surpassing in knowledge. (Msb.) The
phrase فِى ذَاتِ اللّٰهِ is like فِى جَنْبِ اللّٰهِ [In, or
in respect of, that which is the right, or due, of
God; or in, or in respect of, obedience to God, or
the means of obtaining nearness to God, or the
way of God]: and like لِوَجْهِ اللّٰهِ [for the sake of
God; or to obtain the countenance, or favour,
or approbation, or recompense, of God]: (Msb:)
or it means in obedience to God; and in the way
of God or his religion: (TA:) [or it may be
rendered for the sake of God Himself; and so
لِوَجْهِ اللّٰهِ: it is said to have been used by the
Arabs [of the classical age], as well as by Aboo-Temmám, [who was a Muwelled;] (Mgh, Msb, *)
but some deny that it occurs in the old language.
(Msb. [See, however, an ex. from a trad. voce
أُخَيْشِنُ.]) [It is said that] the phrase مَجَلَّتُهُمْ ذَاتُ
الإِلٰهِ, used by En-Nábighah, (Msb,) i. e. EdhDhubyánee, (TA in art. جل,) means Their book
is the service of God Himself: (Msb:) [but
it seems more reasonable to render this phrase
agreeably with the primary signification of ذات
as meaning their book is that of God, in a sense
like that in which a house of worship is said to be
a house of God; for,] as some relate it, the phrase
used by En-Nábighah is مَحَلَّتُهُمْ ذَاتُ الإِلٰهِ, with
حاء, [i. e. their abode is in a peculiar manner that
of God,] meaning, their abode is one of pilgrimage
and of sacred sites. (S and TA in art. جل.) ―
-b15-
ذُو is sometimes redundant [in respect of meaning,
though governing as a prefixed n.]; and so is its
pl. (T, * TA.) Az says, (TA,) I have heard more
than one of the Arabs say, كُنَّا بِمَوْضِعِ كَذَا مَعَ
ذِى عَمْرٍو, i. e. We were in such a place with
Amr: (T, TA:) and كَانَ مَعَنَا ذُو عَمْرٍو, i. e.
'Amr was with us: and أَتَيْنَا ذَا يَمَنٍ, meaning
أَتَيْنَا اليَمَنَ [We came to El-Yemen]. (T.) [See
an ex. similar to this last, and evidently belonging
to the present art., in the latter half of art. ذا.
And see لَا ذَا جَرَمَ and لَا أَنْ ذَا جَرَمَ and لَا عَنْ ذَا
جَرَمَ and لَا ذَا جَرَ (in which ذا is in like manner
redundant, as are also أَنْ and عَنْ, the latter of
which is a dial. var. of the former of them,) in
art. جرم: perhaps belonging to the present art.,
like أَتَيْنَا ذَايَمَنٍ; or perhaps to art. ذا. See also
what is said respecting ذُو prefixed to a proper
name in an early portion of this paragraph.] ―
-b16-
It is also used in the sense of اَلَّذِى, (T, S, M, K,)
in the dial. of Teiyi, (T, S, TA,) for the purpose
of qualifying a determinate noun (S, M, K) by
means of a proposition which it connects with
that noun: (M, K:) and when thus used, it
[generally] retains the same form when it denotes
a dual and a pl. (S, M, K) and a fem., (S,)
and exhibits no sign of case: (M, K:) you say,
أَنَا ذُو عَرَفْتُ [I who knew], and ذُو سَمِعْتُ [who
heard]; and هٰذِهِ المَرْأَةُ ذُو قَالَتْ كَذَا [This is the
woman who said such a thing: (S:) and أَتَانِى ذُو
قَالَ ذٰلِكَ [He who said that came to me]; and
أَتَانِى ذُو قَالَا ذٰلِكَ [They two who said that came
to me]; and أَتَانِ ذُو قَالُوا ذٰلِكَ [They who said
that came to me]. (M.) But Fr says, I heard
an Arab of the desert say, بِالفَضْلِ ذُو فَضَّلَكُمْ اللّٰهُ بِهِ
وَالكَرَامَةِ ذَاتُ أَكْرَمَكُمُ اللّٰهُ بِهَا [By the excellence
wherewith God hath made you to excel, and the
honour wherewith God hath honoured you]; thus
they use ذَاتُ in the place of اَلَّتِى, and they make
it to be with refa in every case: and they confuse
[numbers and genders] in speaking of a dual
number and a pl. number [and a fem.]; they
sometimes say, [for ex.,] in the case of the dual,
هٰذَانِ ذُو تَعْرِفُ and هَاتَانِ ذُو تَعْرِفُ [These two
whom, or which, thou knowest]; and a poet says,
[namely, Sinán Ibn-El-Fahl, of the tribe of Teiyi,
(Ham p. 292,)]
فَإِنَّ المَآءَ أَبِى وَجَدِّى
وَبِئْرِى ذُو حَفَرْتُ وَذُو طَوَيْتُ
[For verily the water is the water of my father
and my grandfather, and my well which I dug
and which I cased; making ذو to relate to a fem.
noun]: and some, he adds, use the dual and pl.
and fem. forms; thus they say, هٰذَانَ ذَوَا قَالَا ذَاكَ
[These two who said that], and هٰؤُلَآءِ ذَوُوا قَالُوا
[These who said], and هٰذِهِ ذَاتُ قَالَتْ [This
female who said]; and he cites the saying of
a poet,
جَمَعْتُهَا مِنْ أَيْنُقٍ سَوَابِقْ
ذَوَاتُ يَنْهَضْنَ بِغَيْرِ سَائِقْ
[I collected them from outstripping she-camels,
that rise and hasten in their pace without a
driver]; and the prov., أَتَى عَلَيْهِ ذُو أَتَى عَلَى
النَّاسِ, meaning الَّذِى أَتَى [i. e. What has come
upon men in general has come, or came, upon
him]. (T.) Accord. to the usage most in repute,
ذُو in this sense is indecl., and has no variation of
gender or number; but some decline it, like ذو
in the sense of صَاحِب, except that they make
ذَات and ذَوَات indecl., with damm for the termination, saying ذَاتُ and ذَوَاتُ in every case, if
they adopt the chaste mode; otherwise, in the
accus. and gen. cases, saying ذَاتِ, and in like
manner ذَوَاتِ (I' Ak pp. 40 and 41.) ―
-b17-  They
said also, لَاأَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ بِذِى تَسْلَمُ (M, K) and
بذى تَسْلَمِينَ, (M,) and بذى تَسْلَمَانِ, (M, K,)
and بذى تَسْلَمُونَ and بذىتَسْلَمْنَ, (M,) meaning I will not do that by thy, and by your,
safety: (M, K:) or by God who, (M,) or by
Him who, (K,) maketh thee, and you, to be in
safety. (M, K.) [See also art. سلم.]
ذَاتٌ fem. of ذُو [q. v. passim]. (T, S, M, &c.)
ذَاتِىٌّ: see ذَوَوِىٌّ, below, in three places.
ذَاتِيَّةٌ [a post-classical word, used in philosophy,
The essential property or quality, or the aggregate of the essential properties or qualities, of a
thing]. The ذَاتِيَّة of a human being is [the
essential property or quality of] rational animality; and is also termed مَاهِيَّةٌ. (Kull p. 148.)
ذَوَوِىٌّ the rel. n. of ذُو; (S, TA;) and of ذَاتٌ
also, (S, M, Msb, TA,) the ة of the original being
rejected in forming the rel. n.: (S, Msb, * TA:)
↓ ذَاتِىٌّ, as rel. n. of ذَاتٌ, is not allowable: (M:)
[but it is much used, mostly in philosophical and
religious writings, as meaning Essential, &c.:]
they say ↓ الصِّفَاتُ الذَّاتِيَّةُ [meaning The essential
attributes]; (Mgh, Msb;) but this is a wrong
expression: and ↓ عَيْبٌ ذَاتِىٌّ [An essential, or] a
natural, an innate, an original, or a constitutional, fault or imperfection &c. (Msb.)
