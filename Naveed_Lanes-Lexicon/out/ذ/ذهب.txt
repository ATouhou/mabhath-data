ذهب1
ذَهَبَ, (S, A, &c.,) aor.
ذَهَبَ, (A, K,) inf. n.
ذَهَابٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ذِهَابٌ (TA) and ذُهُوبٌ
(S, A, K) and مَذْهَبٌ, (A, K,) He (a man, S,
[and a beast,]) went [in any manner, or any pace];
went, or passed, along; marched; journeyed;
proceeded: went, or passed, away; departed:
syn. مَشَى, (A,) or سَارَ, (K,) or مَرّ: (S, A, K:)
and said of a mark or trace or the like [as
meaning it went away]. (Msb.) [And hence,
(assumed tropical:)  It wasted away; became consumed, destroyed,
exhausted, spent, or expended.] ―
-b2-  ذَهَبَ إِلَيْهِ He
went, repaired, betook himself, or had recourse,
to him, or it. (TA.) And they say also, ذَهَبَ الشَّأْمَ
[He went to Syria]; making the verb trans.
without a particle; for although الشأم is here a
special adv. n., they liken it to a vague locality.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  ذَهَبَ عَنْهُ He, or it, went from, quitted,
relinquished, or left, him, or it. (TA.) ―
-b4-
ذَهَبَ فِىالأَرْضِ, (A, Msb,) inf. n. ذَهَابٌ and
ذُهُوبٌ and مَذْهَبٌ, He went away [into the
country, or in the land]: (Msb:) [but it often
means (assumed tropical:)  he went into the open country, or out of
doors, to satisfy a want of nature: or simply]
(tropical:)  he voided his excrement, or ordure. (A.) ―
-b5-
ذَهَبَ بِهِ He went, or went away, with him, or it:
(A:) and he made him, or it, to go, go away,
pass away, or depart; (A, Msb, K;) as also
↓ اذهبهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) and بِهِ ↓ اذهب, (K,) but
this is rare; (Zj, TA;) and ↓ ذهّبهُ, inf. n. تَذْهِيبٌ:
(MF:) [all may likewise be rendered he removed,
dispelled, put away, or banished, it; properly and
tropically: and (assumed tropical:)  he made it to cease; made away
with it, did away with it, made an end of it;
wasted, consumed, destroyed, exhausted, spent, or
expended, it; and these meanings may perhaps
be intended by أَزَالَهُ, whereby the first is explained
in the A and K, as are also the second and third
in the K:] or, accord. to some, when ذَهَبَ is
trans. by means of بِ, accompaniment is necessarily signified; but not otherwise; so that if you
say ذَهَبَ بِهِ, the meaning is, he went away with
him, or it; i. e., accompanying him, or it; [he
took away, or carried off or away, him, or it;]
but if you say ↓ اذهبهُ or ↓ ذهّبهُ, the meaning is,
he made him, or it, to go, go away, pass away,
or depart, alone, without accompanying him, or
it: this, however, is not agreeable with the phrase
in the Kur [ii. 16], ذَهَبَ اللّٰهُ بِنُورِهِمْ [though this
may be well rendered God taketh away their
light]. (MF, TA.) [Hence,] one says, أَيْنَ
يُذْهَبُ بِكَ, which may mean (assumed tropical:)  Where, or whither,
wilt thou be taken away, and what will be done
with thee and made to come to pass with thee, if
this be thine intellect? or, accord. to Mtr, it is a
saying of the people of Baghdád, addressed to
him whom they charge with foolish judgment or
opinion, as meaning أَيْنَ يُذْهَبُ بِعَقْلِكَ (assumed tropical:)  [Where,
or whither, is thine intellect taken away?]. (Har
p. 574.) [In like manner one says, ذَهَبَ عَقْلُهُ
(assumed tropical:)  His reason, or intellect, quitted him, or forsook
him; he became bereft of his reason, or intellect.
And ذَهَبَ فُؤَادُهُ (assumed tropical:)  His heart forsook him, or
failed him, by reason of fear or the like.] And
ذَهَبَ لَحْمُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [His flesh wasted away]. (K in
art. بحر, &c.) And ذَهَبَ الرَّجُلُ فِى القَوْمِ (tropical:)  The
man became lost [or he disappeared] among the
people, or party. (A.) And ذَهَبَ المَآءَ فِى اللَّبَنِ
(tropical:)  The water became lost [or it disappeared] in the
milk. (A.) ―

he forgot it. (A, TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  It was, or became,
dubious, confused, or vague, to him. (MA.) ―
-b7-
ذَهَبَ مَذْهَبًا حَسَنًا (S, A, TA) (tropical:)  He pursued a good
way, course, mode, or manner, of acting or conduct
or the like. (TA.) And ذَهَبَ فِى الدِّينِ مَذْهَبًا
(assumed tropical:)  He formed, or held, an opinion, or a persuasion,
or a belief, respecting religion: or, accord. to
Es-Sarakustee, he introduced an innovation in
religion. (Msb.) And ذَهَبَ مَذْهَبَ فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  He
pursued the way, course, mode, or manner, of
acting &c. of such a one. (Msb.) And ذَهَبَ لِذَهْبِهِ
and لِمَذْهَبِهِ (tropical:)  He pursued his way, course,
mode, or manner, of acting &c. (JK, TA.) And
ذَهَبَ إِلَى مَذْهَبٍ (tropical:)  He betook himself to [or took
to or held] a belief, a creed, a persuasion, a
doctrine, an opinion, a tenet, or a body of tenets
or articles of belief. (K, TA.) And فُلَانٌ يَذْهَبُ
إِلَى قَوْلِ أَبِى حَنِيفَةَ (tropical:)  Such a one takes to, or
holds, [the saying, or] the belief, creed, persuasion,
doctrine, &c., of Aboo-Haneefeh. (A.) [And
ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَنَّ الأَمْرَ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He held, or was of
opinion, that the thing, or affair, or case, was
so. And ذَهَبَ بِلَفْظٍ إِلَىلَفْظٍ آخَرَ (assumed tropical:)  He regarded
a word, or an expression, in his manner of using
it, as equivalent to another word, or expression;
as, for instance, when one makes a fem. noun
masc. because it is syn. with a noun that is masc.,
or makes a verb trans. by means of a certain perticle because it is syn. with a verb that is trans. by
means of that same particle: and also (assumed tropical:)  he regarded a word, or an expression, as etymologically
relating, or traceable, to another word, or expression. And ذَهَبَ بِهِ إِلَى مَعْنَى كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He
regarded it, or used it, (i. e. a word, or an expression,) as relating to such a meaning, or as
meaning such a thing.] ―

ذَهِبَ, (S, K,) aor.
ذَهَبَ, (K,) inf. n. ذَهَبٌ; (TA;)
and ذِهِبَ, with two kesrehs, (IAar, K,) of the
dial. of Temeem, held by AM to be a variation
generally allowable in the case of a verb of which
the medial radical letter is a faucial and with
kesr; (TA;) He (a man) saw gold in the mine,
(S,) or came suddenly, in the mine, upon much
gold, and his reason departed in consequence
thereof, (K,) and his eyes became dazzled, so as
not to close, or move, the lids, or became confused,
so as not to see, (S, K,) by reason of the greatness
thereof in his eye: (S:) it is derived from ذَهَبٌ:
and the epithet applied to a man in this case is
↓ ذَهِبٌ. (TA.)

a certain religious persuasion or the like.]
ذَهْبٌ: see مَذْهَبٌ:

sentence of the paragraph here following.
ذَهَبٌ [Gold;] a certain thing well known;
(S, Msb, &c.;) accord. to several of the leading
lexicologists, (TA,) i. q. تِبْرٌ; (A, L, K, &c.;)
but it seems to have a more general meaning; for
تِبْرٌ is specially applied to such [gold] as is in the
mine, or such as is uncoined and unwrought:
(TA:) [it is a coll. gen. n.; and therefore] it is
masc. and fem.: (S, * Msb, K, * TA:) or it is fem.
in the dial. of El-Hijáz: or, accord. to Az, it
is masc., and not to be made fem. unless regarded
as pl. of ↓ ذَهَبَةٌ, (Msb, TA,) [or rather as a coll.
gen. n., for] ذَهَبَةٌ is the n. un., (K,) signifying
a piece of ذَهَب [or gold]: (S, A, L, TA:) or,
accord. to El-Kurtubee, it is fem., and sometimes
masc., but more commonly fem.: ↓ ذُهَيْبَةٌ is the
dim. of ذَهَبٌ, the ة being added because the
latter word is fem., like as it is in قُوَيْسَةٌ and
شُمَيْسَةٌ; or it is the dim. of ذَهَبَةٌ, and signifies a little piece of ذَهَب [or gold]: (TA:) the pl. of ذَهَبٌ is
أَذْهَابٌ [a pl. of pauc.] (S, A, Msb, K) and ذُهُوبٌ
(S, K) and ذُهْبَانٌ (Nh, Msb, K) and ذِهْبَانٌ. (Nh,
