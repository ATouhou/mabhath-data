ذَهَلَ, (S, K,)

ذَهَلَ, (Msb,) inf. n.
ذُهُولٌ; (S;) He forgot it, or neglected it; (S;)
he was, or became, unmindful of it; (S, Msb:) or
he neglected it intentionally; (JK, T, M, K, *
TA; عَلَى عَهْدٍ in the K being a mistake for
على عَمْدٍ, as in the [JK and T and] M; TA;) or
in consequence of his being diverted by something:
(T, K:) or he forgot it, or dismissed it from his
mind, intentionally, and became diverted from it:
(Z, Msb:) ذُهُولٌ is the neglecting a thing, dismissing it from the mind: (Ham p. 31:) or the
quitting a thing, with confusion, or perplexity, or
alienation of mind, such as arises from fear &c.:
(Ksh and Bd in xxii. 2:) or the being diverted
from one's constant companion, or familiar, so
as to forget him; and being content to relinquish
him: (K;) or diversion that occasions grief and
forgetfulness. (Er-Rághib, TA.) Hence, in the
Kur [xxii. 2], يَوْمَ تَرَوْنَهَا تَذْهَلُ كُلُّ مُرْضِعَةٍ عَمَّا
أَرْضَعَتٌ [On the when thou shalt see it, every
woman giving suck shall forget, or neglect, &c.,
what she has suckled]. (TA.)
