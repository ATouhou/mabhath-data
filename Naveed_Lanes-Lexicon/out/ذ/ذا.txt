ذاذَا is said by Aboo-'Alee to be originally ذَىْ;
the ى, though quiescent, being changed into ا:
(M:) or it is originally ذَيَى or ذَوَى; the final
radical letter being elided: some say that the
original medial radical letter is ى because it has
been heard to be pronounced with imáleh [and so
it is now pronounced in Egypt]; but others say
that it is و, and this is the more agreeable with
analogy. (Msb.) It is a noun of indication,
[properly meaning This, but sometimes, when
repeated, better rendered that,] relating to an
object of the masc. gender, (S, M, K,) such as is
near: (I'Ak p. 36:) or it relates to what is
distant [accord. to some, and therefore should
always be rendered that]; and هٰذَا, [which see in
what follows,] to what is near: (K in art. هَا:
[but the former is generally held to relate to what
is near, like the latter:]) or it is a noun denoting
anything indicated that is seen by the speaker
and the person addressed: the noun in it is ذَ, or
ذ alone: and it is a noun of which the signification
is vague and unknown until it is explained by
what follows it, as when you say ذَا الرَّجُلُ [This
man], and ذَا الفَرَسَ [This horse]: and the nom.
and accus. and gen. are all alike: (T:) the
fem. is ذِى (T, S, M, K, but omitted in the CK)
and ذِهْ, (S, M, K, but omitted in the CK,) the
latter used in the case of a pause, (S,) with a
quiescent ه, which is a substitute for the ى, not a
sign of the fem. gender, (S, M,) as it is in طَلْحَهْ
and حَمْزَهْ, in which it is changed into ة when
followed by a conjunctive alif, for in this case the
ه in ذِه remains unchanged [but is meksoorah, as
it is also in other cases of connexion with a
following word]; and one says also ذهِى; (M;)
and تَا and تِهْ: (S and K &c. in art. تا:) for the
dual you say ذَانِ and تَانِ; (M;) ذَانِ is the dual
form of ذَا (T, S) [and تَانِ is that of تَا used in the
place of ذِى]; i. e., you indicate the masc. dual
by ذَانِ in the nom. case, and ذَيْنِ in the accus.
and gen.; and the fem. dual you indicate by تَانِ
in the nom. case, and تَيْنِ in the accus. and gen.:
(I'Ak p. 36:) the pl. is أُلَآءِ [or أُلَآءِ] (T, S, and
I'Ak ib.) in the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz,
(I'Ak,) and أُولَى [or أُلَى] (T, I'Ak) in the dial.
of Temeem; each both masc. and fem. (I'Ak ib.
[See art. الى.]) You say, ذَا أَخُوكَ [This is thy
brother]: and ذِىأُخْتُكَ [This is thy sister]: (T:)
and لَاآتِيكَ فِى ذِى السَّنَةِ [I will not come to thee
in this year]; like as you say فى هٰذِهِ السَّنَةِ and
فى هٰذِى السَّنَةِ; not فى ذَا السَّنَةِ, because ذا is
always masc. (As, T.) And you say, ذَانِ أَخَوَاكَ
[These two are thy two brothers]: and تَانِ أُخْتَاكَ
[These two are thy two sisters]. (T.) And
أُولَآءِ إِخْوَتُكَ [These are thy brothers]: and أُولَآءِ
أَخَوَاتُكَ [These are thy sisters]: thus making no
difference between the masc. and the fem. in the
pl. (T.) ―
-b2-  The هَا that is used to give notice, to
a person addressed, of something about to be said
to him, is prefixed to ذَا [and to ذِى &c.], (T, S,
M, K,) and is a particle without any meaning but
inception: (T:) thus you say هٰذَا, (T, S, M,) and
some say هٰذَاا, adding another ا; (Ks, T;) fem.
هٰذِى, (T, S, M,) and [more commonly] هٰذِهْ in
the case of a pause, (M,) and هٰذِهِ in other cases,
(T, S,) and هَاتَا, and some say هٰذَاتِ, but this is
unusual and disapproved: (T:) dual هٰذَانِ for the
masc., and هَاتَانِ for the fem.; (T;) said by IJ
to be not properly duals, but nouns formed to
denote duals; (M;) and many of the Arabs say
هٰذَانِّ; (T;) some, also, make هٰذَانِ indecl., like
the sing. ذَا, reading [in the Kur xx. 66] إِنَّ هٰذَانِ
لَسَاحِرَانِ [Verily these two are enchanters], and it
has been said that this is of the dial. of Belhárith
[or Benu-l-Hárith] Ibn-Kaab; but others make it
decl., reading إِنَّ هٰذَايْنِ لَسَاحِرَانِ: (S, TA: [see,
however, what has been said respecting this
phrase voce إِنَّ:]) the pl. is هٰؤُلَا in the dial. of
Temeem, with a quiescent ا; and هٰؤُلَآءِ in the
dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, with medd and
hemz and khafd; and هٰؤُلَآءٍ in the dial. of Benoo-
'Okeyl, with medd and hemz and tenween.
(AZ, T.) The Arabs also say, لَا هَا اللّٰهِ ذَا, introducing the name of God between هَا and ذَا;
meaning No, by God; this is [my oath, or] that
by which I swear. (T.) In the following verse,
of Jemeel,
وَأَتَى صَوَاحِبُهَا فَقُلْنَ هٰذَا الَّذِى
مَنَحَ المَوَدَّةَ غَيْرَنَا وَجَفَانَا
[it is said that] هَذَا is for أَذَا, (M,) i. e., ه is here
substituted for the interrogative hemzeh (S * and
K in art. ها) [so that the meaning is, And her
female companions came, and said, Is this he who
gave love to other than us, and treated us unkindly?]: or, as some assert, هَذَا is here used for
هٰذَا, the ا being suppressed for the sake of the
measure. (El-Bedr El-Karáfee, TA in art. ها.)
―
-b3-  One says also ذَاكَ, (T, S, M, K,) affixing to ذَا
the ك of allocution, [q. v., meaning That,] relating
to an object that is distant, (T, *, S, and I'Ak
p. 36,) or, accord. to general opinion, to that which
occupies a middle place between the near and the
distant, (I'Ak pp. 36 and 37,) and this ك has no
place in desinential syntax; (S, and I'Ak p. 36;)
it does not occupy the place of a gen. nor of an
accus., but is only affixed to ذا to denote the
distance of ذا from the person addressed: (T:)
for the fem. you say تِيكَ (T, S) and تَاكَ; (S and
K in art. تا, q. v.;) but not ذِيكَ, for this is wrong,
(T, S,) and is used only by the vulgar: (T:) for
the dual you say ذَانِكَ (T, S) and ذَيْنِكَ, as in the
phrases جَآءَنِى ذَانِكَ الرَّجُلَانِ [Those two men
came to me] and رَأَيْتُ ذَيْنُكَ الرَّجُلَيْنِ, [I saw those
two men]; (S;) and some say ذَانِّكَ, with teshdeed,
(T, S,) [accord. to J] for the purpose of corroboration, and to add to the letters of the noun, (S,)
but [accord. to others] this is dual of ذٰلِكَ, [which
see in what follows,] the second ن being a
substitute for the ل; (T on the authority of Zj
and others;) and some say تَانِّكَ also, with tesh-deed, (T, S,) as well as تَانِكَ: (T in this art., and
S and K in art. تا, but there omitted in some
copies of the S:) the pl. is [أُولَاكَ and] أُولٰئِكَ.
(T, S.) هَا is also prefixed to ذَاكَ; so that you say,
هٰذَاكَ زَيْدٌ [That is Zeyd]: (S, TA:) and in like
manner, for the fem., you say هَاتِيكَ and هَاتَاكَ:
(S and K in art. تا:) but it is not prefixed [to the
dual nor] to أُولٰئِكَ. (S.) ―
-b4-  You also add ل in
ذَاكَ, (T, S, M, K,) as a corroborative; (TA;)
so that you say ذٰلِكَ, [meaning That,] (T, S, M,
K,) relating to an object that is distant, by common consent; (I'Ak pp. 36 and 37;) or hemzeh,
saying ذَائِكَ, (K,) but some say that this is a
mispronunciation: (TA in art. ذوى:) for the fem.
you say تِلْكَ and تَالِكَ: the dual of ذٰلِكَ is ذَانِّكَ,
mentioned above; and that of the fem. is ثَانِّكَ:
(T: [and in the K in art. تا, تَالِكَ is also mentioned as a dual, as well as a sing.:]) and the pl.
is أُولَالِكَ. (S and M and K voce أُولَى or أُلَى or
أُلَا. [See art. الى.]) هَا is not prefixed to ذٰلِكَ
(S) nor to تِلْكَ [nor to أُولَالِكَ] because, as IB
says, the ل denotes the remoteness of that which
is indicated and the ها denotes its nearness, so that
the two are incompatible. (TA in art. تا.) ―
-b5-  In
the saying in the Kur [ii. 256, the Verse of the
Throne], مَنْ ذَا الَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ, (T,
TA,) accord. to Th and Mbr, (TA,) هٰذَا is syn.
with ذا [so that the meaning is, Who is this
that shall intercede with Him but by his permission?]: (T, TA:) or it may be here redundant
[so that the meaning is, Who is he that &c.?].
(Kull.) ―
-b6-  It is sometimes syn. with اَلَّذِى. (T,
S, M.) So in the saying, مَا ذَا رَأَيْتَ [What is it
that thou sawest?]; to which one may answer,
مَتَاعٌ حَسَنٌ [A goodly commodity]. (Sb, S.) And
so in the Kur [ii. 216], وَ يَسْأَلُونَكَ مَا مَا ذَا يُنْفِقُونَ
[And they ask thee what amount of their property
is it that they shall expend in alms]; (T, M, TA;)
accord. to those who make the reply to be in the
nom. case; for this shows that ما is [virtually] in
the nom. case as an inchoative, and ذا is its
enunciative, and ينفقون is the complement of ذا;
and that ما and ذا are not to be regarded as one
word: [or] this is the preferable way of explanation
in the opinion of Sb, though he allowed the other
way, [that of regarding ما and ذا as one word,
together constituting an inchoative, and ينفقون
as its enunciative, (see Ham p. 521,)] with [the
reply in] the nom. case: (M:) and هٰذَا, also, is
used in the same sense: (TA:) so too ذا in
مَا ذَا هُوَ and مَنْ ذَا هُوَ may be considered as syn.
with الذى; but it is preferable to regard it as
redundant. (Kull.) ―
-b7-  It is [said to be] redundant
also in other instances: for ex., in the trad. of
Jereer, as related by Aboo-'Amr Ez-Záhid, who
says that it is so in this instance: يَطْلُعُ عَلَيْكُمْ
رَجُلٌ مِنْ ذِى يَمَنٍ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ مَسْحَةٌ مِنْ ذِى مُلْكٍ
[There will come to you a man from El-Yemen,
having upon his face an indication of dominion].
(TA. [But this evidently belongs to art. ذُو; in
which see a similar ex. (أَتَيْنَا ذَا يَمَنٍ). See also
other exs. there.]) ―
-b8-  [كَذَا lit. means Like this:
and hence, thus: as also هٰكَذَا. ―
-b9-  It is also often
used as one word, and, as such, is made the complement of a prefixed noun; as in سَنَةَ كَذَا and
فِى سَنَةِ كَذَا In such a year. See also art. كَذَا:
and see the letter ك.] ―
-b10-  هٰذَا is sometimes used to
express contempt, and mean estimation; as in the
saying of 'Áïsheh respecting 'Abd-Allah Ibn-
'Amr Ibn-'Abbás, يَا عَجَبًا لِابْنِ عَمْرٍو هٰذَا [O
wonder (meaning how I wonder) at Ibn-'Amr,
this fellow!]. (Kitáb el-Miftáh, cited in De
Sacy's “ Gram. Ar.,” 2nd ed., i. 442.) [يَا هٰذَا
often occurs as addressed to one who is held in
mean estimation: it is like the Greek
ὦ οὗτο�, and
virtually like the vulgar Arabic expression يَا أَنْتَ,
and the Latin heus tu; agreeably with which it
may be rendered O thou; meaning O thou fellow;
an appellation denoting mean estimation being
understood: in the contrary case, one says يَا فَتَى.
See also, in what follows, a usage of ذَاكَ and ذٰلِكَ.
―
-b11-  هٰذَا in a letter and the like is introduced when
the writer breaks off, turning to a new subject;
and means “ This is all that I had to say on the
subject to which, it relates: ” what follows it is
commenced with the conjunction وَ.] ―
-b12-  One says,
لَيْسَ بِذَاكَ [and لَيْسَ بِذٰلِكَ], meaning It is not
approved: for, [like as a person held in mean
estimation is indicated by هٰذَا, which denotes a
thing that is near, so,] on account of its high
degree of estimation, a thing that is approved is
indicated by that whereby one indicates a thing
that is remote. (Kull voce ليس.) [See also what
next follows.] ―
-b13-  ذٰلِكَ الكِتَابُ in the Kur ii. 1 is
said by Zj to mean هٰذَا الكِتَابُ [This book]: but
others say that ذلك is here used because the book
is remote [from others] in respect of highness and
greatness of rank. (TA.) ―
-b14-  كَذٰلِكَ [lit. Like
that, often means so, or in like manner: and ―
-b15- ]
Let that suffice [thee or] you. (TA in art. ذعر,
from a trad.) ―
-b16-  The dim. of ذَا is ذَيَّا: (T, S, M:)
you form no dim. of the fem. ذِى, using in its
stead that of تَا, (S,) which is تَيَّا: (T:) the dim.
of the dual [ذَانِ] is ذَيَّانِ: (S:) and that of [the
pl.] أُولَآءِ [and أُولَى] is أُولَيَّآءِ [and أُولَيَّا]: (T:) ―
-b17-
that of هٰذَا is ذَيَّا, like that of ذَا; [and you may
say هٰذَيَّا also; for] that of هٰؤُلَآءِ is هٰؤُلَيَّآءِ: (T:) ―
-b18-
that of ذَاكَ is ذَيَّاكَ: (S, K: *) and that of تَاكَ is
تَيَّاكَ: (K in art. تا:) ―
-b19-  that of ذٰلِكَ is ذَيَّالِكَ:
(S, K: *) and that of تِلْكَ is تَيَّالِكَ. (S.) A rájiz
says,
أَوْ تَحْلِفِى بِرَبِّكَ العَلِىِّ
إِنِّى أَبُو ذَيَّالِكِ الصَّبِىِّ
[Or thou shalt swear by thy Lord, the High,
that I am the father of that little child]: (S,
TA:) he was an Arab who came from a journey,
and found that his wife had given birth to a boy
whom he disacknowledged. (TA.)
-A2-  ذَا is also
the accus. case of ذُو, q. v.
