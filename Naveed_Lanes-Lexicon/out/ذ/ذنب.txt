second is sometimes, metaphorically, of the horse:
(Er-Riyáshee, TA:) or, as some say, the second
signifies the place of growth of the ذَنَب [or tail]:
(M:) the pl. of ذَنَبٌ is أَذْنَابٌ. (S, M, A, Msb,
K.) [Hence the following phrases &c.] ―

find in the M حَوَّ الرُملِ,] and growing upon one
stem and two stems: (M, TA:) or, accord. to
AHn, a certain herb, having a جزرة [app. meaning rhizoma like the carrot], which is not eaten,

and having a small dust-coloured blossom upon
which bees feed; (M, TA;) rising about the
height of a man, (TA,) or half the height of a
man; (M;) two whereof suffice to satiate a

فَإِنْ أَبَيْتُمْ فَلَنَا القَلِيبُ
[as meaning For you shall be a great bucket, and
for us a great bucket: or, if ye refuse this, for
us shall be the well]. (T.) [Accord. to the K, it
also signifies A grave: but this is evidently a
mistake, which seems to have arisen from a misunderstanding of a statement by ISd, who says,]
Aboo-Dhu-eyb uses it metaphorically in relation
to a grave, calling it [i. e. the grave] a well, in
his saying,
فَكُنْتُ ذَنُوبَ البِئْرَ لَمَّا تَبَسَّلَتْ
وَسُرْبِلْتُ أَكْفَانِى وَوُسِّدْتُ سَاعِدِى
[app. meaning (tropical:)  And I was as though I were
the corpse of the grave (lit. the bucket of the well)
when she frowned, and clad with my grave-clothes,

or so inclined that the face is turned towards
Mekkeh]. (M.) [And Umeiyeh Ibn-Abee-
'Áïdh El-Hudhalee, describing a wild he-ass
and she-asses, likens to it a certain rate of running

him to a well such as is termed خَسِيفٌ: see
