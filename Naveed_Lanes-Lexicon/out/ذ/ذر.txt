(Fr, S, K.) Hence the saying of Hoteiäh, satirizing Ez-Zibrikán, and praising the family of
Shemmás Ibn-Láy,
وَكُنْتَ كَذَاتِ البَوِّ ذَارَتْ بِأَنْفِهَا
فَمِنْ ذَاكَ تَبْغِى بُعْدَهُ وَتُهَاجِرُهْ
i. e. [And thou wast like her who has a stuffed
skin of a young camel made for her and placed
near her that she may incline to it and yield her
milk,] that has inclined to the young one of
another; [and on that account desires its distance
from her, and severs herself from it:] in the S
we find, for البَوِّ, البَعْلِ; and for بُعْدَهُ, غَيْرَهُ; but
the former are the correct readings: ذَارَتْ is a
contraction of ذَارَّتْ: or, accord. to some, it is for
ذَآءَرَتْ: see art. ذأر. (IB and TA.) ―
-b2-  One says
also, فِى فُلَانٍ ذِرَارٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  In such a one is
