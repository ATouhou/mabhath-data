lowered, humbled, or submitted, himself,] to him;

trained: and said of any animal, he tamed. ―
-b2-
Hence, (assumed tropical:)  He beat, or trod, a road, so as to render

upon: see ذَلِيلٌ.] ―
-b3-  And ذلّل لَهُ أَمْرًا (assumed tropical:)  He made

التَّذْلِيلُ signifies the disposing evenly the bunches

the bunch will rise to him; and if one sit, it will
hang down to him. (TA.) [In like manner,]
التَّذْلِيلُ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The putting the raceme of
the palm-tree upon the branch [near it] in order
that it [the branch] may support it: (AHn, M:)
or تَذْلِيلُ العُذُوقِ, as practised in the present
world, is (assumed tropical:)  the trimmer's making straight, and
fecundating before the usual time, the racemes of
the palm-tree, when they come forth from their
spathes that covered them, these having slit open
and disclosed them, by which means one makes
them to hang out from among the branches and
prickles, so that the fruit is easily plucked when
it ripens. (T. [See also مُذَلَّلٌ.]) [Hence it is
said in the K that ذُلِّلَ النَّخْلُ signifies وُضِعَ
عِذْقُهَا عَلَى الجَرِيدَةِ لِتَحْمِلَهُ: the explanation
should be وُضِعَتْ عُذُوقُهَا عَلَى الجَرِيدِ لِتَحْمِلَهَا, i. e.
(assumed tropical:)  The palm-trees had their racemes put upon the
branches in order that these might support them.]

became, in a state of commotion, or agitation, and
lax, slack, or pendulous. (K.)

لَهُ وَلِىٌّ مِنَ الذُّلِّ, in the Kur [xvii. last verse],
means Nor hath taken to himself any aider to
assist Him and league with Him by reason of any
lowness of condition in Him, as is the custom of
the Arabs to do: (K, TA: [in the CK, يُخالِفُهُ is
erroneously put for يُحَالِفُهُ:]) for they used to
league, one with another, seeking thereby to
become strong and inaccessible. (TA.) See also
ذَلِيلٌ. ―
-b2-  And see the paragraph here following,
in five places.
ذِلٌّ Easiness, tractableness, submissiveness, or
manageableness; (S, M, K, and Ham p. 50;
[mentioned in the M and Msb and K as an
inf. n.;]) as also ↓ ذُلٌّ. (M, K, and Ham ubi
suprà.) Hence the saying, بَعْضُ الذِّلِّ أَبْقَى لِلْأَهْلِ
وَالمَالِ [Somewhat of submissiveness is most
preservative of the family and the property]:
(S:) or أَبْقَى لِلْأَهْلِ وَالمَالِ ↓ الذُّلُّ, occurring in a
trad. of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr; meaning that abjectness
betiding a man when he bears patiently an injury
that has befallen him is most preservative of him
and of his family and his property. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Also Gentleness; and mercy; and so ↓ ذُلٌّ: thus in
the phrase, ↓ وَاخْفِضْ لَهُمَا جَنَاحَ الذُّلِّ or الذِّلِّ,
(M, K,) in the Kur [xvii. 25, lit. And make soft
to them (thy two parents) the side of gentleness;
meaning treat them with gentleness]: the former
is the common reading: (TA:) or the latter
means easiness, tractableness, or submissiveness:
(K:) [and so the former, as has been stated above:]
Er-Rághib says that ↓ الذُّلُّ is a consequence of
subjection; and الذِّلُّ is what is after refractoriness:
so that the phrase means, [accord. to the former
reading,] be gentle like him who is subjected to
them; and accord. to the latter reading, be gentle
and tractable, or submissive, to them. (TA.)
-A2-
Also The beaten track, (K,) or part that is trodden
and made even, (M,) of a road. (M, K.) Its pl.
أَذْلَال occurs in the saying, أَجْرِ الأُمُورَعَلَى أَذْلَالِهَا

ways, or manners, that are fit, or proper, for

[Let fate take its ways after the youth left behind
in El-Mahw]; (S, M;) meaning I mourn not
for any thing after him: cited by AA: (S in the
present art. and in art. محو:) المحو is here the
name of a place. (S in the latter art.) And one
says, أُمُورُ اللّٰهِ جَارِيَةُ عَلَى أَذْلَالِهَا, (S, M, K,) and
جَارِيَةٌ أَذْلَالَهَا, (M, K,) The decrees of God take
their [appointed] courses: (S, M, K:) here, also,
اذلال is pl. of ذِلٌّ. (M, K.) And ↓ دَعْهُ عَلَى أَذْلَالِهِ
Leave thou him, or it, in his, or its, [present]
state, or condition: (S, M, K:) in this case it
has no sing. (M, K.) [And so in the saying,]
↓ جَآءَ عَلَى أَذْلَالِهِ It came in its [proper] manner.
(S, K.) ―

man: (TA, as from the M: [but not found by me
in the latter; and I believe that the right reading
is ذَلَوْلًى, belonging to art. ذلى, q. v.:]) the
former alike masc. and fem.: (M, TA:) pl. ذُلُلٌ
(S, M, Msb, K) and أَذِلَّةٌ. (K.) A poet applies
the epithet ذُلُل to spear-heads, as meaning Made
easy [to pierce with] by being sharpened, and
made thin and slender. (M.) ―

Msb, K) and ذِلَالٌ. (M, K.) ―

↓ ذُلَذِلَةٌ all signify the lower, or lowest, parts of a
long shirt (M, K) when it dangles and becomes

of the K, erroneously, ذَلْذَل, or ذَلْذُل, and ذَلْذَلَة,]
signify the same; (K;) [or rather] the former of
these two is a contraction of the pl. ذَلَاذِلُ (S, M)

nose-rein of [twisted] leather, thin; and a shank

stalk (lit. internodal portion) of the papyrus
(بَرْدِىّ) growing among irrigated palm-trees
having their racemes bent down (ذُلِّلَتْ) by reason
of the abundance of their fruit; so that their
branches overshade these papyrus-plants: or,
accord. to some, and a shank resembling the stalk
of the irrigated papyrus that is bent down (مُذَلَّل)
by saturation: (EM pp. 28 and 29:) As says that
it means, [agreeably with the former explanation,]
سَاقٍ كَأُنْبُوبِ بَرْدِىٍّ بَيْنَ هٰذَا النَّخْلِ المُذَّلَلِ: AO
says that سَقِىّ means watered [naturally,] without
occasioning one's taking any trouble to water:
IAar explained المُذَلَّل as meaning having the
way of the water thereto made easy: and some
