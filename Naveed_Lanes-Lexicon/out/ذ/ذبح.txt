ذبح1
ذُبَحَ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) aor.
ذَبَحَ, (K,) inf. n.
ذَبْحٌ (S, Msb, K, &c.) and ذُبَاحٌ, (K,) He cut, or
divided, lengthwise; clave; split; slit; rent, or
rent open; ripped, or ripped open. (S, Msb, K.)
[Accord. to Fei,] this is the primary signification.
(Msb.) [But see what follows.] You say, ذَبَحَ
فَأْرَةَ المِسْكَ (assumed tropical:)  He (a perfumer, A) ripped open the
follicle, or vesicle, of mush, (A, TA,) and took
forth the mush that was in it. (TA.) [In the A
and TA this is said to be tropical; the authors
evidently holding it to be from ذَبَحَ in the sense
here next following.] ―
-b2-  He slaughtered [for
food, or sacrificed,] (L, TA) and animal, (Msb,)
or a sheep or goat, (S, TA,) or an ox or a cow,
and a sheep or goat, and the like, (Mgh,) [in the
manner prescribed by the law, i. e.,] by cutting
the وَدَجَانِ [or two external jugular veins], (Mgh,)
or by cutting the throat, from beneath, at the
part next the head: (L, TA:) accord. to the K,
i. q. نَحَرَ: but correctly, الذَّبْحُ is in the throat; and
النَّحْرُ is in the pit above the breast, between the
collar-bones, where camels are stabbed: the latter
word is used in relation to camels and bulls and
cows; and the former, in relation to other animals:
or, not improbably, both may have originally
signified the causing the soul to depart by wounding
the throat, or the pit above the breast, which is
the stabbing-place in the camel; and may then
have been applied in peculiar [and different]
senses by the lawyers. (MF. [See also ذَكَاةٌ, in
art. ذكو.]) Also (assumed tropical:)  He slaughtered, or slew, in
any manner. (L.) [You say, ذَبَحَ عَنْهُ He
slaughtered, or sacrificed, for him, by way of expiation.] And ذَبَحَ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا (assumed tropical:)  [They slaughtered,
or slew, one another]. (S, K.) And أَخَذَهُمْ بَنُو
فُلَانٍ بِالذُّبَاحِ (assumed tropical:)  The sons of such a one slaughtered,
or slew, them. (TA.) And ↓ ذبّح (inf. n. تَذْبِيحٌ,
KL) signifies the same as ذَبَحَ, except that it
applies [only] to many objects; whereas the latter
applies to few and to many: thus it is said in the
Kur [ii. 46, and in like manner in xiv. 6],
يُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [They slaughtering, or slaying,
your sons], accord. to the reading commonly
obtaining. (Aboo-Is-hák, TA.) ―
-b3-  Hence, (tropical:)  He
killed; because الذَّبْحُ [in its proper sense, when
the object is an animal,] is one of the quickest
modes of killing. (TA.) It is said in a trad.,
(Mgh, TA,) cautioning against accepting the
office of a Kádee, (Mgh,) مَنْ جُعِلَ قَاضِيًا بَيْنَ
النَّاسِ فَكَأَنَّمَا ذُبِحَ بِغَيْرِ سِكِّينٍ (tropical:)  [Whoso is made a
Kádee among the people, he is as though he were
slaughtered without a knife]: (Mgh, TA: *) expl.
by some as meaning, (tropical:)  he is as though he were
killed [&c.]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  [Hence, also, because
الذَّبْحُ renders the flesh of an animal allowable, or
lawful, as food,] (tropical:)  It rendered allowable, or lawful: as salt and the sun and the fishes called
نِينَان (pl. of نُونٌ) do wine, by changing its
quality, as is said in a trad. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Also (tropical:)  He
broached, or pierced, a دَنّ [or wine-jar, making
a hole in the mouth, or removing the clay that
closed the mouth], so as to draw forth the contents. (S, A, Msb, K.) ―
-b6-  And (tropical:)  He, or it,
choked. (K, TA.) You say, ذَبَحَتْهُ العَبْرَةُ (tropical:)  Weeping choked him. (A, TA.) ―
-b7-  And, said of thirst,
(tropical:)  It affected him severely, or distressed him.
(A, TA.) ―
-b8-  ذَبَحَتِ اللِّحْيَةُ فُلَانًا (tropical:)  The beard
flowed down beneath the chin of such a one so
that the anterior portion of the part beneath his
lower jaw was apparent: in which case, the man
is said to be بِلِحْيَتِهِ ↓ مَذْبُوحٌ. (K, TA.)
2
ذَبَّحَ see 1.
-A2-  تَذْبِيحٌ is [said to be] syn. with
تَذْبِيحٌ, (K, TA,) in prayer: accord. to Hr, ذبّح
رَأْسَهُ signifies He lowered his head, in inclining
his body in prayer; like دبّح: and accord. to
Lth, ذبّح signifies he lowered his head, in
inclining his body in prayer, so that it became
lower than his back: but Az says that this is a
mistake, and that the correct word is دبّح, with
the unpointed د. (TA.)
6
تذابحوا (assumed tropical:)  They slaughtered, or slew, one
another. (S, MA, K.) One says, التَّمَادُحُ التَّذَابُحُ
(tropical:)  [Mutual praising is mutual slaughtering].
(S, A.)
8
اِذَّبَحَ He took, or prepared, for himself a
slaughtered [or sacrificed] animal. (S, K.)
ذِبْحٌ An animal prepared for slaughter [or
sacrifice; i. e. an intended victim]: (T, A, Msb,
TA:) [see also ذَبِيحٌ, which occurs in this sense
in a trad. as applied to a human being:] or an
animal that is slaughtered [or sacrificed]; (S,
Mgh, K, TA;) and so ↓ ذَبِيحَةٌ; (Mgh, Msb;)
or this signifies a slaughtered [or sacrificed] sheep
or goat; (TA;) and is [nominally] fem. of ذَبِيحٌ,
but the ة is affixed only because the quality of a
subst. is predominant in it: (S:) or the ذَبِيحٌ is added
to denote that the word is applied to a sheep, or
goat, [to be slaughtered or sacrificed,] not yet
slaughtered [or sacrificed]; and when the act has
been executed upon it, it is [said to be] ذَبِيحٌ:
(M, voce رَمِيَّةٌ:) ذِبْحٌ is applied to an animal that
is slaughtered either as a sacrifice on the occasion
of the pilgrimage or otherwise; and is like طِحْنٌ
in the sense of مَطْحُونٌ, and عِطْفٌ in the sense of
مَعْطُوفٌ, &c.: (TA:) the pl. of ↓ ذَبِيحَةٌ is ذَبَائِحُ.
(Mgh, Msb.) It is said in the Kur [xxxvii. 107],
وَفَدَيْنَاهُ بِدِبْحٍ عَظِيمٍ [And we ransomed him with
a great victim]. (S, A.) الجِنِّ ↓ ذَبَائِحُ means
Animals sacrificed to the Jinn, or Genii: for it
was customary for a man, when he bought a
house, or drew forth [for the first time] the water
of a spring, and the like, to sacrifice an animal
to the Jinn with the view of avoiding ill luck,
(A, TA,) lest some disagreeable accident should
happen to him from the Jinn thereof: (A:) and
the doing this is forbidden. (A, TA.)
-A2-  See
also ذُبَحَةٌ.
ذُبَحٌ A certain plant which ostriches eat: (S:)
this word and ↓ ذِبَحٌ signify the plant called الجَزَرُ
البَّرىُّ, (K, TA,) which is of a red colour: and,
accord. to the K, another plant: but correctly a
red plant (نَبْتٌ أَحْمَرُ, not نبت آخَرُ,) having a
stem, or root, (أَصْلٌ) from which is peeled off a
black peel, whereupon there is taken forth a
white substance, resembling a white خزرة [or
bead, but perhaps this is a mistranscription for
جَزَرَة, i. e. a carrot], which is sweet and good, and
is eaten: [each word is a coll. gen. n.;] and the
n. un. is ذُبَحَةٌ and ذِبَحَةٌ: so says AHn, on the
authority of Fr: and he says also, on the authority
of AA, that the ذُبَحَة is a tree that grows upon a
stem, and in a manner resembling the كراث [app.
كَرَاث, not كُرَّاث], and then has a yellow flower;
its root is like a جزرة [i. e. جَزَرَة, or carrot], and it
is sweet, and of a red colour: (TA:) or the ذُبَح
is a plant having a stem, or root, (أَصْلٌ,) which
is peeled, and there comes forth what resembles
the جِزر [i. e. جِزَر or جَزَر, meaning carrot]; and a
black skin is peeled from it; and it is sweet, and
is eaten; and has a red flower. (Ham p. 777.) ―
-b2-

common, (Th, TA,) A species of the كَمْأَةٌ [or
truffle], (K,) of a white colour. (TA.) ―

art.]. (Mgh.)
-A2-  See also what here next follows.
ذُبَحَةٌ (AZ, S, A, K) and ↓ ذُبْحَهٌ, (As, A, K,)
but this latter, which is used by the vulgar, was
unknown to AZ, (S,) and ↓ ذُبَاحٌ (A, K) and

the حَلْق [or fauces], (AZ, T, S, A, K,) which
sometimes kills: (T:) or blood which chokes and
kills: (K:) or an ulcer that comes forth in the
حَلْق [or fauces] of a man, like the ذِئْبَة that
attacks the ass: (ISh, TA:) or an ulcer that
appears in that part, obstructing it, and stopping
the breath, and killing. (TA.) One says, أَخَذَتْهُ
الذُّبَحَةُ [The ذبحة attacked him]. (S.) And
↓ الطَّمَعُ ذُبَاحٌ (tropical:)  Covetousness is [like] a disease in
the fauces: or a poisonous plant. (A.) And
كَانَ ذٰلِكَ مِثْلَ الذُّبَحَةِ عَلَى النَّحْرِ [That was like
the disease called ذبحة in the uppermost part of
the breast]: a prov., applied to the case of a man
whom one imagines to be a sincere friend, and
who proves to be an evident enemy: (TA:) or
كَانَ مِثْلَ الذُّبَحَةِ الخ He was like the ذبحة &c.,
a disease in the حَلْق, which does not quit the
patient externally, and hurts him internally: said
by him to whom you complain of one whom you
imagined to be a sincere friend, and whose affection was outward, when his deceit has become
manifest. (Meyd.)
-A2-  دُبَحَةٌ is also the n. un. of
ذُبَحٌ [q. v.]. (Fr, AHn.)
ذِبَحَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
-A2-
It is also the n. un. of ذِبَحٌ [q. v. voce ذَُبَحٌ].
(Fr, AHn.)
ذُبَاحٌ A certain poisonous plant, (A, K, TA,)
that kills the eater of it; as also ↓ ذُبَحٌ. (TA.)
One says, الطَّمَعُ . ذُبَاحٌ: see ذُبَحَةٌ, in two places.
―
-b2-  [Hence,] مَوْتٌ ذُبَاحٌ (assumed tropical:)  A quick, or sudden,
death. (L.)
-A2-  See also ذُبَّاحٌ.
ذِبَاحٌ: see ذُبَحَةٌ.
ذَبِيحٌ and ↓ مَذْبُوحٌ signify the same [i. e. Cut,
or divided, lengthwise; &c.: see 1]. (S, Msb, K,
TA.) You say مِسْكٌ ذَبِيحٌ [for ذَبِيحٌ فَأْرَتُهُ],
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Musk of which the follicle, or vesicle,
is] ripped open. (A. [It is there said to be
tropical: but see 1.]) ―
-b2-  Both are [also] applied
to an animal, (Msb,) or a sheep or goat, (TA,)
[or an animal of the ox-kind, and a sheep or goat,
and the like, (see 1,)] as meaning Slaughtered, in
the manner described in the first paragraph of
this art.: (TA:) the fem. of ذَبِيحٌ is with ة: (S,
TA: [see ذَبِيحَةٌ below:]) but ذَبِيحٌ is used as a
fem. epithet without the addition of ة: you say
شَاةٌ ذَبِيحٌ as well as كَبْشٌ ذَبِيحٌ, because ذَبِيحٌ is
an instance of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of
the measure مَفْعُولٌ; though you say شاة ذَبِيحَةٌ
also; and in like manner نَاقَةٌ: the pl. [of ذَبِيحٌ] is
ذَبْحَى and ذَبَاحَى and [that of ذَبِيحَةٌ is] ذَبَائِحُ.
(TA.) Aboo-Dhu-eyb says, describing wine,
يُقَالُ لَهَا دَمُ الوَدَجِ الذَّبِيحُ
meaning المَذْبُوحُ عَنْهُ, i. e. [One would call it the
blood of the external jugular vein,] for which it
had been slit [to let it flow]. (AAF, TA.) And
again he says,
وَسِرْبٍ تَطَلَّى بِالعَبِيرِ كَأَنَّهُ
دِمَآءُ ظِبَآءُ بِالنُّحُورِ ذَبِيحُ
[app. meaning And many a bevy of women rubbed
over with perfume compounded with saffron, as
though it were the blood of gazelles, the gazelles
whereof had been slaughtered in the upper parts
of the breasts]: he applies ذبيح as an epithet to
دمآء, meaning ذَبِيحٌ ظِبَاؤُهُ; and he applies it as an
epithet to a pl. n. because it is of the measure
فَعِيلٌ [in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ], for
such an epithet is applicable to masc. and fem.
and sing. and pl. nouns. (TA.) ―
-b3-  ذَبِيحٌ also
signifies An animal that is fit, or proper, to be
slaughtered as a sacrifice: (ISk, S, K:) [or that
is destined, or prepared, for sacrifice; i. e., an
intended victim; like ذِبْحٌ; as appears from the
fact that] الذَّبِيحُ is (assumed tropical:)  a surname of Ismá'eel, or
Ishmael; (K, * TA;) for, accord. to some [or
rather the generality] of the Muslims, he was the
son whom Abraham designed to sacrifice, though
others say it was Isaac: (TA:) and أَنَا ابْنُ
الذَّبِيحَيْنِ occurs in a trad. [as said by Mohammad,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  I am the son of the two intended
victims; namely, Ismá'eel and 'Abd-Allah]; for
'Abd-El-Muttalib incurred the obligation to sacrifice his son 'Abd-Allah, the father of the Prophet,
by reason of a vow, and ransomed him with a
hundred camels. (K, * TA.) ―
-b4-  Also (tropical:)  A slain
man. (A.)
ذَبِيحَةٌ, and its pl. ذَبَائِحُ: see ذِبْحٌ, in three
places.

ذَبَّاحٌ One whose occupation, or habit, is that
of slaughtering sheep or the like. ―
-b2-  And, in the
present day, (assumed tropical:)  An executioner.]
ذُبَّاحٌ (T, S, K) and sometimes ↓ ذُبَاحٌ, without
teshdeed, (T, K,) the former the more common,
(T, K,) but disallowed by AHeyth, who holds it
to be one of the words of the measure فُعَالٌ
denoting diseases, (TA,) (tropical:)  Cracks in the inner
[i. e. lower] sides of the toes, (S, K, TA,) next the
fore part of the foot: (TA:) or a cut across the
inner sides of the toes: (Ibn-Buzurj, T:) or a
crack in the inner side, or sole, of the foot:
(IAar, TA voce نَكْبَةٌ:) pl. ذَبَابِيحُ. (TA.) Hence
the saying, مَا دُونَهُ شَوْكَةٌ وَلَا ذُبَّاحٌ (tropical:)  [There is not
in the way of its attainment a thorn nor are
there any cracks in the inner sides of the toes, &c.:
see also نَكْبَةٌ]. (S, TA.)
ذَابِحٌ [act. part. n. of 1]. سَعْدُ الذَّابِحِ, (S, K,)
or سَعْدٌ الذَّابِحُ, (so in one copy of the S,) (assumed tropical:)  Two
bright stars, between which is the space of a cubit
(ذِرَاع), over against one of which (فِىنَحْرِ وَاحِدٍ
مِنْهُمَا) is a small star that, by reason of its nearness, is as though it [app. meaning the bright
star, or the pair of bright stars,] were about to
slaughter it; (S, K;) whence the appellation of
الذَّابِح: (S:) the two stars [alpha and beta] which are
in one of the horns of Capricornus; so called
because of the small adjacent star, which is said
to be the sheep or goat (شاة) of الذابح, which he
is about to slaughter: (Kzw:) it is one of the
Mansions of the Moon; (S, Kzw;) [namely,
the Twenty-second Mansion: see also art. سعد:
some give this appellation to the Twenty-third
Mansion: and some, to the Twenty-fifth; but
the two stars above mentioned are clearly the
Twenty-second, with the place of which they
agree accord. to those who make النَّوءُ to signify
“ the auroral rising ” and those who make it to
signify “ the auroral setting: ” see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in
art. نزل.] The Arabs [used to] say, إِذَا طَلَعَ
الذَّابِحُ انْجَحَرَ النَّابِحُ (assumed tropical:)  [When الذابح rises aurorally, the barker enters, or betakes itself to, its
hole: the period of its auroral rising, in Central
Arabia, about the commencement of the era of
the Flight, being the 16th of January, O. S.].

-b2-
(tropical:)  The chancel of a church; i. e. the part of a
church that is like the مِحْرَاب of a mosque:
(A, * K, * Msb:) pl. مَذَابِحُ: (A, Msb, K:) the
مَذَابِح are the مَحَارِيب (S, A, K) of the Christians; (A;) so called because of the oblations
(قَرَابِين) there offered; (S, TA;) the مَقَاصِير
(K, TA) in churches, pl. of مَقْصُورَةٌ; said to be
