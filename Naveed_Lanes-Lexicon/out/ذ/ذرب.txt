A poet says, (S,) namely, Hadramee Ibn-'Ámir

وَ عَرَفْتُ مَا فِيكُمْ مِنَ الأَذْرَابِ
(tropical:)  [And I have borne with you not withstanding

is in you of foul, or obscene, qualities of the
tongue]; (AZ, S:) [or] على بُلَلَاتِكُمْ (IAar, M,
TA) means notwithstanding what is in you of
annoyance and enmity: (TA:) but accord. to Th,
he said, الأَعْيَابِ, pl. of عَيْبٌ. (M, TA.) [Accord.

or became, in a good, or right, state: (K; but
only the inf. ns. of the verb in this sense, and in
the next, and not the verb itself, is there mentioned:) and also, (M, K,) (tropical:)  his stomach was, or
became, in a bad, or corrupt, state: (T, S, M, A,
Msb, K:) thus having two contr. significations.

ذَرُبَ, (M, L, Msb, TA,)
accord. to the K
