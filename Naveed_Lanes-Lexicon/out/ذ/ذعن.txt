اذعن لَهُ, (S, Msb, * K, &c.,) inf. n. إِذْعَانٌ,
(Msb,) He was, or became, quick in obedience to
him, or it: (K:) this is its [proper, or primary,]
meaning, accord. to Aboo-Is-hák, in the language
of the Arabs: (TA:) and he acknowledged, or
confessed, to him: (K:) and he was, or became,
lowly, or humble, and abject, to him: (S, K:)
and he was, or became, tractable, submissive, or
manageable, to him; (S, * Msb, * K, TA;) and
easy; (K, * TA;) not disobedient; (Msb;) as also
↓ ذَعِنَ, aor.
ذَعَنَ, (K,) inf. n. ذَعَنٌ. (TA.) You
say, اذعن لِى بِحَقِّى He obeyed me with respect
to that [right, or due,] which I sought to obtain
from him, and hastened to render it: and he
acknowledged, or confessed, to me my right, or
due, willingly, not against his will; as also أَمْعَنَ.
(TA.) Some have used إِذْعَانٌ as meaning Perception, and understanding: but there is no
foundation for this in the language of the Arabs;
and its being tropical, as some of the sheykhs
have endeavoured to show it to be, is improbable.
(MF.)
