ذوق1
ذَاقَهُ, (K,) first pers. ذُقْتُهُ, aor. أَذُوقْهُ, (S,
Msb,) inf. n. ذَوْقٌ and ذَوَاقٌ and مَذَاقٌ (S, Msb, K)
and مَذَاقَةٌ, (S, K,) He tasted it; i. e., perceived
its taste, by means of the moisture of the tongue:
(Msb:) or he tried, or knew, its taste: (K:)
it is originally said of that of which little is taken:
when much is taken, the term أَكْلٌ is used [and
one says أَكَلَهُ]: and ↓ تذاوقهُ signifies the same
as ذَاقَهُ. (TA.) You say, ذُقْتُ الشَّىْءَ [I tasted
the thing], (S,) or الطَّعَامَ [the food]. (Msb.)
And يَوْمٌ مَا ذُقْتُهُ طَعَامًا, meaning مَا ذُقْتُ فِيهِ [i. e.
A day in which I tasted not food]. (TA.) ―
-b2-
By amplification, الذَّوْقُ is used to signify (assumed tropical:)  The
perceiving, beside tastes, all other objects of the
senses, and states or conditions: (Bd in iii. 177:)
it is not restricted to the sense of the mouth [or
tongue] in the language of the Kur-án nor in the
[genuine or classical] language of the [Pagan]
Arabs. (TA.) Hence, in the Kur iii. 177,
ذُوقُوا عَذَابَ الحَرِيقِ (assumed tropical:)  [Taste ye the punishment of
burning]: (Bd, TA:) for, although, in the common conventional acceptation, the verb relates to
what is little in quantity, it is regarded as suitable
to be used in relation to what is much. (TA.)
One says also, فُلَانٌ ذَاقَ كَذَا وَأَنَا أَكَلْتُهُ [lit.
Such a one tasted such a thing, and I ate it;]
meaning (assumed tropical:)  such a one knew, or tried or tested,
such a thing, and I knew it, or tried it or tested
it, more. (TA.) ذُقْتُ الشَّىْءَ means (assumed tropical:)  I tried, or
tested, the thing. (Msb.) And hence one says,
ذاق فُلَانٌ البَأْسَ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one experienced harm,
&c.; i. e., knew it by its befalling him. (Msb.)
And ذُقْتُ مَا عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  I knew, or tried or
tested, what [qualities &c.] such a one possessed;
(S, TA;) and so ذُقْتُ فُلَانًا. (TA.) And ذَاقَ
الرَّجُلُ عُسَيْلَةَ المَرْأَةِ وَ ذَاقَتْ عُسَيْلَتَهُ (assumed tropical:)  The man
[tasted or] experienced the sweetness of the carnal
enjoyment of the woman, and she in like manner.
(Msb.) And ذاق طَعْمَ الإِيمَانِ (assumed tropical:)  He tasted, or
experienced, the savour of faith with his heart,
like as the mouth tastes, or experiences, the
savour of food and drink. (TA from a trad.)
And ذُقْتُ كَذِبَهُ وَخَبَرْتُ حَالَهُ (tropical:)  [I experienced
his lying, and knew his condition]. (TA.) And
ذَاقَتْهَا يَدِى, and ذَاقَتْ فُلَانَةَ, (tropical:)  My hand felt her,
and felt such a female. (TA.) ―
-b3-  ذاق القَوْسَ,
(S, K,) inf. n. ذَوْقٌ; (TA;) [and ↓ ذَوَّقَهَا; (so in
Freytag's Lex. from the Deewán el-Hudhaleeyeen;)] (tropical:)  He pulled the string of the bow
(S, K, TA) for the purpose of trial, (K, TA,)
that he might see what was its strength. (S, TA.)
―
-b4-  ↓ الذَّوْقُ is also employed to signify (assumed tropical:)  [Taste,
as meaning intellectual discernment and relish;
i. e.] the faculty that is adapted to the acquisition of matters of knowledge, considered as being,
in its perfection of perception, like sensation,
regarded as a natural property; and particularly
that [faculty] which concerns the niceties of language; because it [i. e. nice language] is, to the
soul of man, like delicious intellectual food.
(Kull. [When used as a subst in this sense, its
pl. is أَذْوَاقٌ.]) One says, هُوَحَسَنُ الذَّوْقِ لِلشِّعْرِ,
meaning (tropical:)  He has a good [taste or] natural
faculty for poetry. (TA.) ―
-b5-  [Also (assumed tropical:)  Voluptuousness; sensuality: see ذَوَّاقٌ.]

أَذَقْتُهُ الطَّعَامَ, (Msb, K, *) inf. n. إِذَاقَةٌ, (TA,)

its taste by means of the moisture of the tongue:
(Msb:) or I made him to try, or know, the

-b2-  [Hence,] أَذَاقَهُ اللّٰهُ
وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [God made him to taste, or experience, the evil result of his affair]. (S.) It is
said in the Kur [xvi. 113], فَأَذَاقَهَااللّٰهُ لِبَاسَ الجُوْعِ
وَالخَوْفِ (assumed tropical:)  [So God made her to taste, or experience, the utmost degree of hunger and of fear]:
the verb is here used with لِبَاس because meant to
convey the meaning of experiencing: or the sentence is elliptical, and means, made them to taste,
or experience, hunger and fear, and clad them
with the clothing thereof. (TA.) And in the same
[xlii. 47], إِذَا أَذَقْنَا الإِنْسَانُ مِنَّا رَحْمَةً (assumed tropical:)  [When
we make man to taste, or experience, mercy from
us]; where, afterwards, الإِصَابَةٌ is opposed to
الإِذَاقَةٌ, in the words وَإِنْ تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-
أَذَاقَ زَيْدٌ بَعْدَكَ كَرَمًا means (tropical:)  Zeyd became generous

i. q. تَنَاوَلُوهَا (tropical:)  [They took the spears, one from
another, app. to test their qualities: see ذَاقَ القَوْسَ,
above]. (K, TA.) Ibn-Mukbil says,
