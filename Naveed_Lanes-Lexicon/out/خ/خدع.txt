خدع1
خَدَعَهُ, (TA,) [aor.
خَدَعَ,] inf. n. خَدْعٌ, (Bd in
ii. 8,) He hid it, or concealed it; (TA;) as also
↓ اخدعه, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. إِخْدَاعٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-
[And hence, app.,] (Lh, K,) inf. n. as above,
(Lh,) (tropical:)  He doubled it, or folded it, one part upon
another; namely, a garment, or piece of cloth.
(Lh, K, TA.) ―
-b3-  [And hence, also, accord. to
some,] خَدَعَهُ, aor.
خَدَعَ, inf. n. خَدْعٌ (S, Mgh, Msb,
K) and خِدْعٌ, (AZ, S, K,) or the latter is a simple
subst., (Msb, TA,) and خَدِيعَةٌ, (TA,) or this
[also] is a simple subst., (Msb, TA,) like خِدَاعٌ,
[which is also an inf. n. of 3,] and like خُدٌعَةٌ, (TA,)
He deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or
outwitted, him; syn. خَتَلَهُ; (S, Mgh, K;) and
desired to do to him a foul, an abominable, or an
evil, action, without his knowing whence it proceeded: (S, K:) or he dissembled [or acted deceitfully] with him; pretended to him the contrary of what he concealed: (TA:) or he made
him to resign, or relinquish, the object that he had
in view, by pretending to him something the contrary of what he concealed: (Er-Rághib, B:)
and ↓ خادعهُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. مُخَادَعَةٌ (S) [and
خِدَاعٌ], signifies the same; (S, * TA;) as also
↓ اختدعهُ; and ↓ تخدّعهُ; and ↓ خدّعهُ, inf. n.
تَخْدِيعٌ: (TA:) or this last signifies he deceived
him, deluded him, beguiled him, circumvented
him, or outwitted him, much: (KL:) [and of
another of these verbs we find the following various explanations:] ↓ خادعهُ is syn. with كَايَدَهُ
[which has the first of the meanings assigned
in this sentence to خَدَعَهُ; or signifies he practised
with him mutual deceit, delusion, guile, or circumvention; he deceived him, &c., being deceived,
&c., by him; and this latter meaning, if not each
meaning, may be intended here by كايده; for
Bd says, (in ii. 8,) that مُخَادَعَة is between two]:
(TA:) or it signifies he strove, endeavoured, or
desired, to deceive, delude, beguile, circumvent,
or outwit, him; (AAF, L;) [agreeably with
what is said by Kemál Páshá Zádeh, (as I find
in a marginal note in a copy of the MS, and also
in the Kull p. 178,) that one says of a man
خادع when he has not attained his desire, and
خَدَعَ when he has attained his desire;] for many
a verb of the measure فَاعَلَ relates to one only;
as in the instances of عَاقَبْتُ اللِّصَّ and طَارَقْتُ
النَّعْلَ: (L:) or it signifies, [like خَدَعَهُ,] he pretended to him something different from that which
was in his mind. (K.) It is said in the Kur
[ii. 8], اللّٰهَ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ↓ يُخَادِعُونَ, (TA,) meaning They pretend, to God and to those who have
believed, something different from that which is
in their minds, by concealing unbelief and pretending belief; for when they do thus to the
believers, they do thus to God: (K:) and again,
[in iv. 141], اللّٰهَ وَهُوَ خَادِعُهُمْ ↓ يُخَادِعُونَ [They
strive, endeavour, or desire, to deceive God, or]
they think that they deceive God, but He is [their
deceiver, i. e.,] the requiter, to them, of their
خِدَاع [or deceit, &c.]: (TA:) or the meaning is
[they deceive] the friends of God: (S:) and
[agreeably with this last rendering, and that given
in the K,] Aboo-Hayáh reads, in the former passage, يَخْدَعُونَ اللّٰهَ: (TA:) [which passage continues thus:] إِلَّا أَنْفُسَهُمْ ↓ وَمَا يُخَادِعُونَ [but they
do not deceive any save themselves]; i. e., the re-
sult of their خِدَاع [or deceit] does not befall any
save themselves: (K:) here, again, Aboo-Hayáh
reads يَخْدَعُونَ: (TA:) Muärrik reads وَمَا
↓ يَخَدِّعُونَ, meaning يَخْتَدِعُونَ. (K.) Accord.
to IAar, الخَدْعُ signifies مَنْعُ الحَقِّ [meaning The
preventing from discovering, or accepting, the
truth]. (L.) [“ He deceived him,” or the like,
seems to be generally regarded as the primary
signification of خَدَعَهُ, for it occupies the first
place in all the lexicons to which I have access:
but Bd says (in ii. 8) that this meaning is from
خَدَعَ said of the ضَبِّ, and that the primary signification of خَدْعٌ is the act of “ concealing: ”
the action of the ضبّ, however, as will appear in
what follows, implies, and originates from, a
desire of deceit; and so, often, does the act of
concealing.] ―
-b4-  [Hence, app.,] خَدَعْتُهُ I gained
the mastery over him. (TA.) ―
-b5-  خَدَعَ, (Lth, TA,
&c.,) aor.
خَدَعَ, inf. n. خَدْعٌ, (TA,) said of a [lizard
of the kind called] ضَبّ, [as though meaning
either خَدَعَ المُحْتَرِشَ It deceived the hunter, or
خَدَعَ نَفْسَهُ it concealed itself,] signifies it entered
into its hole; (Lth;) as also خَدَعَ فِى حُجْرِهِ:
(S, K:) or it scented a man, and therefore entered its hole, in order that it might not be caught;
as also ↓ انخدع: (TA:) or it entered into its
hole in a tortuous manner: and in like manner,
a gazelle into its covert: but mostly said of a
ضبّ: (Abu-l-'Omeythil:) also said of other
things: (Lth:) of a fox, meaning he took to
going to the right and left, deceitfully, or guilefully: and of a man, meaning he hid himself
from another: and he assumed a disposition not
his own. (TA.) [See also خِدَاعٌ, below.] ―
-b6-
Hence, i. e. from خَدَعَ said of the ضبّ, (A, TA,)
خَدَعَتْ عَيْنُ الشَّمْسِ (tropical:)  The disc of the sun set; (A,
K, TA;) like خَضَعَتْ. (TA in art. خضع.) ―
-b7-
[And] خَدَعَتْ عَيْنُهُ (tropical:)  His eye sank, or became
depressed, in his head. (Lh, K, TA.) [Also
meaning (assumed tropical:)  His eye did not sleep: for] خَدَعَتِ
العَيْنُ signifies (assumed tropical:)  the eye did not sleep. (TA.) ―
-b8-
[Hence also, as indicated in the S,] مَا خَدَعَتْ
فِى عَيْنِى نَعْسَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [A slumber did not enter my
eye]: (S:) or مَا خَدَعَتْ بِعَيْنِهِ نَعْسَةٌ, (so in the
L,) or خَدْعَةٌ, i. e. نَعْسَةٌ, (so in the TA,) meaning
(tropical:)  a slumber did not pass by his eye. (L, TA.)
[And from the same source have originated
several other tropical significations, of which exs.
here follow.] ―
-b9-  خَدَعَتِ الأُمُورِ (tropical:)  The affairs varied in their state; or were, or became, variable.
(Ibn-'Abbád, K.) ―
-b10-  خَدَعَتِ السُّوقُ, (S, K,) inf. n.
خَدْعٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  [The market varied in its state;
at one time being brisk, and at another time dull,
in respect of traffic: (see خَادِعٌ, below:) or] the
market became dull in respect of traffic; (S, K;)
as also ↓ انخدعت; (Lh, TA;) or انخدع: (K:
[but سوق is generally fem.:]) and, as some say,
it became brisk in respect of traffic: thus it appears to have two contr. significations: (TA:)
and خَدَعَ السِّعْرُ (tropical:)  The price became high, or dear.
(TA.) ―
-b11-  Said of a man, خَدَعَ also signifies (tropical:)  His
wealth, (K, TA,) and the like, (TA,) became
small in amount, or little. (K, TA.) ―
-b12-  Said of
a time, inf. n. خَدْعٌ, (tropical:)  Its rain became little:
(TA:) and of rain, (tropical:)  It became little. (K, TA.)
―
-b13-  Said of spittle, or saliva, (tropical:)  It dried: (S, K,
TA:) or it became little, and dried, in the mouth:
(A, TA.) or it became deficient; and when it
becomes deficient, it becomes thick; and when it
becomes thick, it becomes stinking: (TA:) or
it became corrupt: (IAar, TA:) and in like
manner, said of a thing, it became corrupt, or
bad. (TA.) [See also خَادِعٌ, below.] ―
-b14-  Said of
a generous man, (K,) (tropical:)  He refrained [from
giving], (S, L, K,) and refused. (L.) You say,
كَانَ فُلَانٌ يُعْطِى ثُمَّ خَدَعَ (tropical:)  [Such a one used to
give; then he refrained, and refused]. (S.)
-A2-
خَدَعَهُ aor.
خَدَعَ, inf. n. خَدْعٌ, He cut, or severed,
his [vein called the] أَخْدَع. (TA.)

quoted above, Yahyà Ibn-Yaamar reads, وَمَا

places.

خَدِعٌ: see خَادِعٌ, in two places.
خَدْعَةٌ A single act of deceit, delusion, guile,
circumvention, or outwitting. (Mgh.) It is said
in a trad., (Mgh, TA,) الحَرْبُ خَدْعَةٌ, and ↓ خُدْعَةٌ,
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and ↓ خِدْعَةٌ, (K,) and ↓ خُدَعَةٌ,
(AZ, Ks, S, Mgh, K,) accord. to different relaters;
(Th, Mgh, K;) the first being the most chaste,
(S, Mgh, Msb,) said to be the form used by Mo-
hammad; (Th, Mgh, Msb;) the second ascribed
by El-Khattábee to the vulgar; (TA;) the last
the best in point of meaning: (Mgh:) i. e., accord. to the first reading, (Mgh,) War is finished
by a single act of deceit, &c.; (Mgh, O, K;)
accord. to the second, war is a thing by which
one is deceived; (Mgh, Msb;) or war is deceived;
for when one of the two parties deceives the
other, it is as though the war itself were deceived;
(IAth, TA;) [accord. to the third, war is a mode,
or manner, of deceiving;] and accord. to the

―
-b2-  One whom people deceive, delude, beguile, circumvent, or outwit, (S, K,) much; (K;) like
as لُعْنَةٌ signifies one “ who is much cursed. ”
(TA.) [See, again, خَدْعَةٌ. The comparison of
خُدْعَةٌ in one sense with لُعْبَةٌ, and in another
sense with لُعْنَةٌ, suggests that one of the explanations above may perhaps be founded upon a
mistranscription. On فُعْلَةٌ as the measure of a
word having the sense of a pass. part. n., see a
remark of IB voce لَقَطٌ.] ―

الضَّبِّ signifies The procedure of the [lizard

hunted by a man feeling the head of its hole in
order that it may imagine him to be a serpent:
if the ضب be experienced, it puts forth its tail to
half the length of the hole, and if it feel a serpent,
it strikes it, and cuts it in halves; and if it be a
hunter, it does not suffer him to lay hold upon its
tail, and so it escapes, for the hunter does not
dare to put his hand into its hole, because it may
not be free from a scorpion, of which he fears the
sting, as a strong friendship subsists between the
ضب and the scorpion, and the former makes use
of the latter to defend itself from the hunter:
or, as some say, it signifies its concealing itself,
and remaining long in its hole, and seldom appearing, and being very cautious. (O, TA.)
خَدُوعٌ: see خَادِعٌ, in three places. ―

and ↓ خَدَّاعُ, (Msb, TA,) and ↓ خَدِعٌ, and ↓ خَيْدَعٌ;
(TA;) [but these three are also intensive epithets,
like خَدُوعٌ;] and ↓ خُدَعَةٌ signifies one who deceives, &c., other men; (S;) or [rather] this last
