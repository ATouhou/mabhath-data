خضّرهُ, [inf. n. تَخْضِيرٌ,] He rendered it أَخْضَر
[i. e. green, &c.]. (S.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] it is said in
a trad., إِذَا أَرَادَ اللّٰهُ بِعَبْدٍ شَرًّا خَضَّرَ لَهُ فِى اللَّبِنِ
وَالطِّينِ حَتَّى يَبْنِىَ, (TA,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [When God
desires evil to befall a man,] He makes him to
have pleasure in unburnt bricks and clay, so that
he may build, and thus be diverted from the
things of the world to come, if his building be
beyond his need, or not such a structure as a
mosque or the like. (Marginal note in a copy of
the “ Jámi' es-Sagheer ” of Es-Suyootee.) [Hence
also,] خُضِّرَ لَهُ فِيهِ, inf. n. as above, (tropical:)  He was
blessed in it. (L, K.) You say, مَنْ خُضِّرَ لَهُ فِى
شَىْءٍ فَلْيَلْزَمْهُ, (L,) or مَنْ خُضِّرَ مِنْ شَىْءٍ فليلزمه,
(so in a copy of the Mgh,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Whosoever is
blessed in a thing, (Mgh, L,) meaning an art or a
trade or traffic, or a means of subsistence, let him
keep to it. (L.)

Msb, K,) He sold to him fruits before they were
in a good, or sound, state: (A:) or before their
goodness, or soundness, became apparent: (S,
Mgh, Msb, K, TK:) the doing of which is forbidden: (S:) accord. to some, (TA,) the prohibition includes the sale of fresh ripe dates,
[app. if not fully ripe,] and herbs, or leguminous
plants, and the like; and therefore some disapprove of selling a greater quantity of fresh ripe
dates than is cut at once. (S.)
4

height. (TA.) See also 9, last sentence. ―
-b2-
Hence, (S, TA,) the pass. form, (assumed tropical:)  He died in his
youth; (S, K;) in his fresh and flourishing
state. (S.) Young men used to say to an old
man, أَجْزَرْتُ يَا شَيْخُ (assumed tropical:)  [Thou hast attained to the
time for dying, (lit. for being cut,) O old man]:
and he replied, أَىْ بَنِىَّ وَتُخْتَضَرُونَ (assumed tropical:)  [O my sons,
and ye shall be cut off, or die, in your youth]. (S.
[See also أَجْزَرَ.]) ―

the green branches of a palm-tree with his مِخْلَب;
(TA;) and so ↓ خَضَرَ, (K, * TA,) aor.

(TA:) and he cut off a thing, as a man's nose, entirely: (TA:) or, simply, he cut off a man's nose.
(IAar.) ―
-b4-  And He ate fruit [while it was green,
or] before it was ripe. (A.) ―
-b5-  And hence, (TA,)
(tropical:)  He deflowered a girl: (K, TA:) or, before she
had attained to puberty; (Msb in art. قض, and
K;) as also اِبْتَسَرَ and اِبْتَكَرَ. (TA.) ―

tawny, or brownish, colour; or blackish; or of
a blackish hue inclining to green; or black; or
intensely black: see خُضْرَةٌ and أَخْضَرُ]. (S, A,
Msb, K.) [Hence,] اخضرّ إِزَارَى (The place of)
my ازار became black: or, rather, became of a
[blackish] hue inclining to green: because the
hair when it first grows is of that hue. (Har
p. 494.) And اخضرّ شَارِبُهُ [His mustache grew
so as to appear dark]; said of a boy; a phrase
similar to بَقَلَ وَجْهُهُ. (Mgh in art. بقل.) And
اخضرّاللَّيْلُ (tropical:)  The night became dark and black.
(K, * TA.) And اخضرّت الظُّلْمَةُ (tropical:)  The darkness

and مَضِرًا ↓ خَضِرًا, He took it without price: or
in its fresh, or juicy, state: (K:) مضرا being an
imitative sequent. (TA.) Whence the saying,
مَضِرَةٌ ↓ الدُّنْيَا خَضِرَةٌ [in the S حُلْوَةٌ خَضِرَةٌ] The
goods of this world are delicate, fresh, and pleasant: or pleasing. (TA.) And ↓ الغَزْوُ حُلْوٌ خَضِرٌ
[Predatory warfare is sweet and] fresh [or refreshing] and loved; because of the victory and

مِضْرًا, (S, K,) and مَضِرًا ↓ خَضِرًا, (K,) His blood
went unrevenged, or unretaliated, or unexpiated
by a mulet: (S, K:) مضرا being an imitative
sequent [here as in the former instance]. (TA.)

-b2-
and last sentence but one; and] see also خُضْرَةٌ.

خَضِرٌ: see أَخْضَرُ. ―
-b2-  Also A place having much
verdure; and so ↓ يَخْضُورٌ and ↓ مَخْضَرَةٌ. (K.)
And أَرْضٌ خَضِرَةٌ and ↓ يَخْضُورٌ Land in which is
much verdure: and ↓ ارض مَخْضَرَةٌ, as in the Kur
xxii. 62, accord. to one reading, verdant land.

And الخَضِرُ The plant called ↓ البَقْلَةُ الخَضْرَآءُ; as

fills the mouth of the camel. (TA.) Also A
species of plant of the kind called جَنْبَة; (K;)
which latter term is applied to herbage whereof
the root is deep in the earth, like the نَصِىّ and
صِلِّيَان: (TA:) [a coll. gen. n.:] n. un. with ة:
(K:) it is not of the slender and succulent herbs
or leguminous plants, which dry up in summer.
(TA.) Hence آكِلَةُ الخَضِرِ, occurring in a trad.,
[properly signifying A she-camel that eats the
plant above mentioned,] applied to a man who
acts justly and moderately with respect to worldly
enjoyments: for the خضر is not of the slender
and succulent herbs, as above observed, nor of
those excellent plants which the spring produces
by its consecutive rains, and which therefore become goodly and soft or tender; but of those
upon which beasts pasture after others have dried
up, because they find no others, and which the
Arabs call جَنْبَة; and the beasts do not eat much
of it, nor do they find it wholesome. (IAth,
TA.)

colour; syn. سُمْرَةٌ: (S:) [and a blackish hue:

(S, K:) AZ says that it is like سَمَارٌ, meaning as
above, diluted so as to be of a dark, or an ashy,
dust-colour (حَتَّى اخْضَرَّ): like as the rájiz says,
جَاؤُوا بِضَيْحٍ هَلْ رَأَيْتَ الذِّئْبَ قَطْ
[They brought milk mixed with much water.
Hast thou ever seen the wolf?]: meaning that
the milk was of an ash-colour (أَوْرَق), like the
colour of the wolf, by reason of the great quantity
of the water: or, as some say, milk and water
in the proportion of one third of the former to
two thirds of the latter: it is of any milk, that
has been kept in a skin or that is fresh, and from
any beast: some say that the word is a pl., [or

n. un., is with ة. (TA.)

proper name; for] you say, هٰذَا خُضَارَةُ طَامِيًا

one copy of the S, I find هٰذِهِ; but in others,

(طَيْرٌ خُضْرٌ,) also called قَارِيَة: A 'Obeyd asserts
that the Arabs loved them, and likened to them a
liberal, or bountiful, man: but ISd says, on the
authority of the 'Eyn, that they regarded them as
of evil omen: (TA:) [Golius states, on the
authority of Meyd, that the خضارىّ is a bird of a
blackish colour, called in Persian كَرايَهْ. See
Bochart's Hieroz. p. ii. col. 61; referred to by
Freytag.] ―

(K.)
أَخْضَرُ [Green; verdant;] of the colour termed

and أَخْضَرُ أَطْحَلُ and أَخْضَرُ أَوْرَقُ: (TA: [see
the latter epithet in each of these cases:]) applied to a man, [and to other things,] tawny, or
brownish: (S:) [and blackish: and of a blackish
hue inclining to green:] and black; (S, K;)
black-complexioned: (TA:) [and intensely black:
it is said in the Msb, art. حتم, that الأَخْضَرُ is,
with the Arabs, أَسْوَدُ; which may mean either
that green is, with the Arabs, termed اسود, or
that الاخضر is, with the Arabs, black: but the
truth is, that each of the epithets أَخْضَرُ and أَسْوَدُ
is sometimes used for the other: see what here
follows, and see أَسْوَدُ: in Har p. 495, it is erroneously said, on the authority of Er-Rázee, that
the اسود is not termed by the Arabs اخضر, although
the اخضر is termed by them اسود because of its
intense خُضْرَة and رِىّ:] the fem. is خَضْرَآءُ: and
the pl. is خُضْرٌ. (Msb, TA.) You say شَجَرَةٌ خَضْرَآءُ
A green, and fresh, or juicy, tree. (TA.) And
مَآءٌ أَخْضَرُ Water inclining to a green colour, by
reason of its clearness. (TA.) And أَخْضَرُ الجِلْدَةِ
[lit. Tawny of skin:] meaning (assumed tropical:)  of pure race;
because the complexions of the Arabs are tawny;
(S;) of genuine Arab race: (IB:) as in the saying of El-Lahabee, (S, TA,) El-Fadl Ibn-'Abbás,
(TA,)
وَأَنَا الأَخْضَرُ مَنْ يَعْرِفُنِى
أَخْضَرُ الجِلْدَةِ فِى بَيْتِ العَرَبْ
[And I am the tawny: who knows me? the
tawny of skin (or pure of race), of the family
that comprises the nobility of the Arabs]. (S,
IB.) And فُلَانٌ أَخْضَرُ القَفَا [lit. Such a one is
blackish, or black, in the back of the neck:] meaning (tropical:)  such a one is the son of a black woman:
(Az, A:) or (tropical:)  one who is slapped on the back of
his neck: (A:) or (tropical:)  a freedman, or an emancipated slave. (TA.) And أَخْضَرُ البَطْنِ (tropical:)  A
weaver: (A, TA:) because his belly, being stuck
close to his loom, becomes blackened by it. (TA.)
And أَخْضَرُ النَّوَاجِذِ (tropical:)  An eater of onions and leeks:
or a tiller, or cultivator, of the ground; because
he eats herbs, or leguminous plants. (A.) And
هُمْ خُضْرُ المَنَاكِبِ [lit. They are green in the
shoulders, from carrying the produce of their
land:] meaning (tropical:)  they are in a state of great
plenty. (K, TA.) And [hence, perhaps,] فُلَانٌ
أَخْضَرُ (tropical:)  Such a one possesses abundant خَيْر [or
wealth, or prosperity]: (A, TA:) [or it may
mean goodness: for] الأَخْضَرُ, applied to a man,
is an epithet of praise, whereby he may be likened
to the sea, because it is described as green, or to
the [rain or herbage called] رَبِيع; in both cases
meaning (assumed tropical:)  liberal, or bountiful; and it is so applied because خُضْرَةٌ is of the colours of the Arabs:
and it is also an epithet of dispraise, as meaning
(assumed tropical:)  black by reason of baseness, ignobleness, or meanness. (Ham p. 282.) And شَابٌّ أَخْضَرُ (tropical:)   A young
man whose hair has begun to grow upon the sides
of his face. (TA.) And كَتِيبَةٌ خَضْرَآءُ (tropical:)  An army,
or a troop of horse, overspread with the blackness
of iron: (S, TA:) or a great army or troop of
horse (K, TA) of which most of the men are clad
in iron; like جَأْوَآءُ: (TA:) because of the خُضْرَة
of the iron: (A:) [i. e.] because of the blackness
thereof. (TA.) And اللَّيْلُ أَخْضَرُ (tropical:)  Night is black.
(TA.) And [hence,] جَنَّ عَلَيْهِ أَخْضَرُ الجَنَاحَيْنِ
(tropical:)  Night [lit. the black-winged] veiled him, concealed him, or covered him with its darkness.
(A.) مُدْهَامَّتَانِ, in the Kur [lv. 64, relating to
two gardens of Paradise], is explained by خَضْرَاوَانِ
because it means Inclining to blackness, by reason
of abundance of moisture, or irrigation. (S.) ―
-b2-
الأَخْضَرُ used as a subst.: see خُضَارَةٌ. ―
-b3-  The fem.
خَضْرَآءُ [is also used as a subst., and] signifies
Gree herbs or leguminous plants; (Msb, K;) as
also ↓ خُضَارَةٌ: (K:) pl. خَضْرَاوَاتٌ: by rule it
should be خُضْرٌ; but as the quality of a subst.
predominates in it, it has a pl. like the pl. of a
subst., like صَحْرَاوَاتٌ pl. of صَحْرَآءٌ: (Msb:) this
pl. occurs in the saying (in a trad., TA) لَيْسَ فِى
الخَضْرَاوَاتِ صَدَقَةٌ There is no poor-rate in the case
of green herbs or leguminous plants; (Msb;) or
fresh fruits and herbs or leguminous plants;
(TA;) or fruits, such as the apple and the pear
&c.; or herbs or leguminous plants, such as leeks
and smallage and rue and the like; and خُضَرٌ,
pl. of خُضْرَةٌ, is sometimes substituted for it.
(Mgh.) [Hence,] إِيَّاكُمْ وَخَضْرَآءُ الدِّمَنِ, meaning (tropical:)  Avoid ye the beautiful woman that is of bad
origin: (S, A, Msb:) because what grows in a
دِمْنَة [or place which men have blackened by
their cooking, and where their camels or other
beasts have staled and dunged], though it may be
beautiful and bright, does not bear fruit [because
it is neglected, and left unwatered], (S, Msb,)
and soon becomes corrupt, or bad. (Msb. [See
also دِمْنَةٌ: and see عُشْبَةٌ الدَّارِ, in art. عشب.]) ―
-b4-
And الخَضْرَآءُ, as an epithet in which the quality
of a subst. predominates, (TA,) (tropical:)  The sky, or
heaven; (S, A, K;) because of its greenness;
like as the earth is called الغَبْرَآءُ. (TA.) You say,
مَا تَحْتَ الخَضْرَآءِ أَكْرَهُ مِنْهُ (tropical:)  [There is not under
the sky one more hateful than he]. (A.) ―
-b5-  And
خَضْرَآءُ (tropical:)  A bucket (A, K) with which water has
been drawn long, so that it has become green or
blackish &c. (حَتَّى اخْضَرَّتْ). (K.) ―
-b6-  And (assumed tropical:)  The
congregated or collective body, and mass, or bulk,
of a people. (S, K.) So in the saying, أَبَادَ اللّٰهُ
خَضْرَآءَهُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [May God destroy the congregated or
collective body, mass, or bulk, of them]: (S:) or
this means, (tropical:)  their stock (شَجَرَة) from which they
have branched off; (A;) [for] خَضْرَآءُ signifies
the origin of anything: (TA:) or, their life in
this present world: (Fr, TA:) or, as some say,
their enjoyment and plenty; (TA;) [for] خَضْرَآءُ
signifies prosperity, and plenty, and enjoyment:
(TA in a later part of this art.:) or the right
reading is غَضْرَآءَهُمْ, meaning “their prosperity,
and their pleasantness of life, or plenty and prosperity.” (S. [See art. غضر.]) ―
-b7-  البَقْلَةُ الخَضْرَآءُ:
see خَضِرٌ. ―
-b8-  الخُضْرُ, (T,) or الخَضْرَآءُ, (K,) The
domestic pigeons; (T, K;) so called although of
various colours, because their predominant colour
is وُرْقَة [or ash-colour], or خُضْرَة [meaning a dark,
or an ashy, dust-colour]: the خُضْر and the نُمْر
[or spotted with white and black, &c.,] are especially characterized by the faculty of rightly
directing their course. (T, TA.) ―
-b9-  الأَخَاصِرُ [a
pl. of الأَخْضَرُ used as a subst.] (tropical:)  Gold and flesh-meat and wine; as also الأَحَامِرَةُ [as some explain
this latter]. (TA.) ―
