خبط1
خَبَطَ, aor.
خَبِطَ, (Msb, K, TA,) inf. n. خَبْطٌ,
(Msb, TA, &c.,) He struck, or beat, (Msb, TA,)
anything: (TA:) or he struck, or beat, it, or
him, vehemently: (M, K, TA:) or خَبْطٌ signifies
a camel's striking, or beating, a thing with his
fore foot: (T, TA:) or in the cases of beasts,
(دَوَابّ, [generally meaning horses and mules and
asses,]) the striking, or beating, with the fore
feet; not with the hind feet: and in the case
of the camel, with the fore foot and the hind
foot: or vehement treading; or of the fore feet
of beasts (دوابّ): (TA:) or, accord. to the
Keshsháf, the act of striking, or beating, in a way
that is not right: or, as some say, the going,
or journeying, upon what is not the middle, or
main part, of the road, or what is not the main
road, or upon a road not open to view: or continuous, or consecutive, striking, or beating, in
different ways: and afterwards tropically applied
to any (tropical:)  beating, or striking, that is not approved:
or originally, the striking, or beating, with the
fore foot or the hind foot, and the like: (MF,
TA:) with the fore feet or legs, it is like رَمْحٌ
with the hind feet or legs. (TA.) You say, of
a camel, خَبَطَ الأَرْضَ, (Msb,) or خَبَطَ الأَرْضَ بِيَدِهِ,
(S, K,) inf. n. as above, (S,) He struck, or beat,
the ground with his fore foot: (S, Msb:) or he
struck, or beat, vehemently the ground with his
fore foot; and ↓ تخبّط and ↓ اختبط signify the
same: (K:) it is said in the O that خَبَطَهُ signifies he struck him with his fore foot, or hand,
and prostrated him, as also ↓ تخبّطهُ: and ↓ اختبط,
said of a camel, is syn. with خَبَطَ: and in the
T, that بِرِجْلِهِ ↓ تَخَبَّطَنِى is syn, with خَبَطَنِى.
(TA.) Hence the trad., لَا تَخْبِطُوا خَبْطَ الجَمَلِ
[lit. Ye shall not beat the ground as the camel
does with his fore foot in rising]; meant to forbid
a man's putting forward his foot in rising from
prostration [in prayer]. (TA.) And خَبَطَهُ, (K,
TA,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,) signifies
also He trod him, or it, vehemently, (K, TA,)
as the camel does with his fore foot. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Hence, (S,) فُلَانٌ يَخْبِطُ خَبْطَ عَشْوَآءَ (S, * TA)
(tropical:)  [Such a one goes at random, in a headstrong
and reckless manner,] like the weak-sighted she-camel that beats the ground with her fore feet
(تَخْبِطُ) as she goes along, not guarding herself
from anything. (S, TA.) It is a prov., applied
to him who turns away from a thing as though
he were not cognizant of it: or to him who is
continually falling into a thing. (Har p. 239.)
Zuheyr says,
رَأَيْتُ المَنَايَا خَبْطَ عَشْوَآءَ مَنْ تُصِبْ
تُمِتْهُ وَمَنْ تُخْطِئْ يُعَمَّرْ فَيَهْرَمِ
I saw the fates [treading mankind] like the treading of the weak-sighted she-camel; whom they
smote, him they killed: and whom they missed,
he was made to continue in life so that he lived to
extreme old age. (TA, and EM p. 132.) In like
manner you say, فُلَانٌ يَخْبِطُ فِى عَمْيَآءَ (tropical:)  Such a
one undertakes what he undertakes with ignorance.
(TA.) And خَبَطَ أَمْرَهُ عَلَى غَيْرِ بَصيرَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [He prosecuted his affair without mental perception, or
without certainty]. (S in art. عشو, q. v.) And
يَخْبِطُ فِى الظَّلَامِ (tropical:)  He goes in the night without a
lamp, and so becomes confounded and perplexed,
and unable to see his right course, and errs from
the way, and perchance may fall into a well.
(TA.) And خَبَطَ اللَّيْلَ, (K, TA,) aor. and inf. n.
as above, (TA,) (tropical:)  He went, or journeyed, in the
night without direction. (K, TA.) And بَاتَ
يَخْبِطُ الظَّلْمَآءَ (tropical:)  [He passed the night traversing the
darkness without direction]. (TA.) خَبْطٌ is said
to signify (assumed tropical:)  The act of journeying, or going, without direction: or upon what is not the middle,
or main part, of the road, or what is not the main
road. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [And hence, perhaps,] خَبَطَهُ
(tropical:)  He asked of him a benefit, or favour, without
any tie of relationship; (K, * TA;) as also
↓ اختبطهُ: (IB, K:) or this is from خَبْطُ وَرَقِ الشَّجَرِ
[explained in what follows]: (Har p. 425:) or
the latter, [or both,] he came to him seeking his
beneficence without any such tie: (S:) or he came
to him seeking a gift; because he who does so
must beat the ground with his feet: (IF:) and
you also say, مَعْرُوفَهُ ↓ اختبط. (Aboo-Málik,
TA.) [The latter verb is the more common.
See also 10.] ―
-b4-  And (tropical:)  He conferred a benefit
upon him without there having been any acquaintance between them, (S, K, TA,) and without
there being anything to draw them near, and
without there being any relationship: (TA:) and
خَبَطَهُ بِخَيْرِ signifies the same: (TA:) or he bestowed on him a benefit, (K, TA,) being asked:
(TA:) and you say also, بِخَيْرٍ ↓ اختبطهُ: (Aboo-Málik, TA:) and خَبَطَ فِيهِمْ بِخَيْرٍ signifies (assumed tropical:)  He
benefited them. (TA.) 'Alkameh Ibn-'Abadeh
says, (S, TA,) praising El-Hárith Ibn-AbeeShemir, (TA,)
وَفِى كُلِّ حَىٍّ قَدْ خَبَطْتَ بِنِعْمَةٍ
(assumed tropical:)  [And upon every tribe thou hast conferred benefit, app. meaning without being related to them]:
(S, TA:) but it is said in a marginal note to the
S, that خَبَطَّ would be better; and so it is accord.
to one relation: in the L, however, it is said that
خَبَتَّ would be more agreeable with analogy.
(TA.) Accord. to AZ, خَبَطْتُ الرَّجُلَ, inf. n. خَبْطٌ,
signifies (assumed tropical:)  I held loving communion, commerce, or
intercourse, with the man. (TA.) ―
-b5-  [In respect
of the places which I have given to the abovementioned significations of asking and conferring
a benefit, I have followed the opinion of IF; but
it is said in the TA, and, I think, with greater
probability, that they are from what here next
follows.] ―
-b6-  خَبَطَ الوَرَقَ مِنَ الشَّجَرِ, aor.
خَبِطَ, (Msb,)
inf. n. خَبْطٌ, (Lth, T, Msb,) He made the leaves
to fall from the trees: (Msb:) or he beat the
leaves of the trees, (Lth, T,) meaning large trees
of the kind called طَلْح, [acacia, or mimosa, gummifera,] with a staff, or stick, (Lth,) so that they
fell off, or became scattered, (Lth, T,) after which
he gave them as food to camels; (Lth;) refrainfrom injuring thereby the trunks and branches
of the trees: (T:) and لَهُ خَبَطًا ↓ اختبط signifies
the same as خَبَطَ. (TA.) And خَبَطَ الشَّجَرَةَ, (S,
K,) aor. as above, (TA,) and so the inf. n., (S,)
He beat the tree with a staff, or stick, in order
that its leaves might fall off: (S:) or he bound
the tree, and then made its leaves to fall, (K, TA,)
by beating it with a staff, or stick, to give them
as food to camels and other beasts. (TA.) The
leaves are stored up for the camels; and in wintertime are bruised, or broken up, for them, and
moistened with water, and given to them as
fodder. (Har p. 218.) Mohammad was asked,
Does الغَبْط [i. e. “ the wishing for a blessing on
the condition that it shall not become transferred
from its possessor ”] injure [its author]? and he
answered, لَا إِلَّا كَمَا يَضُرُّ العِضَاهَ الخَبْطُ [No, save
as the beating off the leaves injures the trees called
'idáh]; i. e., it only diminishes, without annulling,
its author's recompense, like the beating off the
leaves of the 'idáh, without cutting them down and
extirpating them; for the leaves will grow again.
(TA.) [See also art. غبط.] ―
-b7-  Hence, (A, TA,)
خَبَطَ القَوْمَ بِسَيْفِهِ (tropical:)  He struck the people with his

touched him with a hurt, (K, TA,) so as to corrupt him, or disorder him, and render him insane;

[which is the more common,] the devil corrupted
him, or disordered him: (S, Mgh, Msb: *) lit.,
struck him: (Mgh, Msb:) or prostrated him,
and sported with him: or trampled upon him,
and prostrated him. (TA.) It is said in the Kur
[ii. 276], ↓ لَا يَقُومُونَ إِلَّا كَمَا يَقُومُ الَّذِى يَتَخَبَّطُهُ
الشَّيْطَانُ مِنَ الْمَسِّ (tropical:)  [They shall not rise save as he
riseth whom the devil prostrateth by reason of
possession, or insanity]; i. e., as he who is affected by diabolical possession rises, in his state
of possession, when he is prostrated, and falls:
or it means, whom the devil corrupts, or disorders,
by rendering him insane. (K, * TA.) [You say
also, of a drug, العَقْلَ ↓ خبّط (assumed tropical:)  It disordered the
intellect: see the act. part. n., below.] ―
-b9-  خَبَطَ
also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He (a man) threw himself down
(S, L, K) where he was, (S, L,) to sleep, (S, K,)
