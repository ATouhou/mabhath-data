خوف1
خَافَ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) originally خَوِفَ,
(Lth, L, &c.,) first pers. خِفْتُ, (TA,) aor. يَخَافُ,
(S, K, &c.,) originally يَخْوَفُ, (L,) imperative
خَفْ, (S,) inf. n. خَوْفٌ (S, Msb, K, &c.) and
↓ خِيفٌ, [originally خِوْفٌ,] (Lh, TA,) erroneously
written in the K with fet-h [to the خ], but some
say that this is a simple subst., not an inf. n.,
(TA,) and ↓ خِيفَةٌ, (Lh, S, Msb, K, &c.,) originally خِوْفَةٌ, (K,) but some say that this also is
a simple subst., not an inf. n., (TA,) and [therefore] its pl. is خِيفٌ, (Lh, JK, S, and so in the
CK,) in [some of] the copies of the K erroneously
written خِيَفٌ, (TA,) or this [as well as the next
preceding] may be an inf. n., for some few inf. ns.
have pls., (ISd, TA,) and مَخَافَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,
&c.,) originally مَخْوَفَةٌ, for which last, the first
of these inf. ns. is used by a poet, and therefore
made fem., (TA,) He feared; he was afraid or
frightened or terrified; syn. فَزِعَ. (K.) It is
also trans.: (Msb:) you say, خَافَهُ and ↓ تخوّفهُ
[He feared, or was afraid of, him, or it]; (Msb,
TA;) both signifying the same: (TA:) [and so
خَافَ مِنْهُ; or this may mean he feared what
might happen to him from him, or it:] and
عَلَيْهِ شَيْئًا ↓ تخوّف, meaning خَافَهُ [i. e. خَافَ عَلَيْهِ
شَيْئًا He feared for him a thing]: (S, K:) and
خَاَفَهُ عَلَى مَالِهِ and عَلَيْهِ ↓ تخوّفهُ [He feared him,
or it, for his property]. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] it
is also used in the sense of ظَنَّ [He thought, or
opined]: and in this case, the Arabs sometimes
use it in the same manner as a verb signifying an
oath, and give it the same kind of complement;
as in an ex. cited voce دَرِدَ [q. v.]. (S in art. درد.)
And He knew. (Lh, Kr, K.) Hence, وَإِنِ امْرَأَةٌ
خَافَتْ مِنْ بَعْلِهَا نُشُوزًا [And if a woman know that
there is, on the part of her husband, injurious
treatment, or unkindness, or estrangement], (K,)
in the Kur [iv. 127]. (TA.) And hence also,
فَمَنْ خَافَ مِنْ مُوصٍ جَنَفًا [And he who knoweth
that there is, on the part of the testator, an inclining to a wrong course, or a declining from the
right course, &c.], (K,) in the Kur [ii. 178];
thus explained by Lh. (TA.)
-A2-  خَافَهُ, (S,) first
pers. خُفْتُهُ, (K,) aor. يَخُوفُهُ, (S,) He exceeded
him in fear. (S, K. *) You say, فَخَافَهُ ↓ خَاوَفَهُ,
(S,) inf. n. of the former مُخَاوَفَهُ, (TA,) i. e. [He
vied with him to see which of them would exceed
the other in fear, and] he exceeded him in
fear. (S.)
2
خوّفهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. تَخْوِيفٌ, (TA,) i. q.
أَخَافَهُ. (Msb, K.) See the latter, in two places.
He put fear into him. (JK, TA.) خَوِّفْنَا [app.
addressed to God] is mentioned by Lh as meaning
Render the Kur-án and the Traditions beautiful
to us in order that we may [give heed thereto and]
fear. (TA.) ―
-b2-  He made him to be in such a
state, or condition, that men feared him; (JK,
K;) he made him to be feared by men. (M.)
Hence, in the Kur [iii. 169], إِنَّمَا ذٰلِكُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ
يُخَوِّفُ أَوْلِيَآءَهُ, i. e. [Verily that is the devil:] he
causeth his friends to be feared by you: [or that
devil causeth &c.:] or, as Th says, causeth you
to fear by his friends. (TA.)
-A2-  He diminished
it, lessened it, or took from it; and so خوّف مِنْهُ.
(TA.) [See also 5.] ―
-b2-  خوّف غَنَبَهُ He sent away
his sheep, or goats, flock by flock. (TA.)

خَاْوَفَ see 1, last sentence.

اخافهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. إِخَافَةٌ (S) and إِخَافٌ,
like كِتَابٌ, (Lh, TA,) [but the latter is irreg. and
rare,] He, or it, (an affair, a case, or an event,
Msb,) caused him, or made him, to fear, or be
afraid; put him in fear; frightened, or terrified,
him; (TA;) and ↓ خوّفهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.
تَخْوِيفٌ, (S, TA,) signifies the same. (S, Msb,
K.) So in the phrase اخاف الثَّغْرُ [The enemies'
frontier caused to fear, &c.; was insecure:] or
fear entered from it. (TA.) You say also, مَالَ
الحَائِطُ فَأَخَافَ النَّاسَ [The wall leaned, and caused
the people to fear]. (Msb.) And أَخَافَ اللُّصُوصُ
الطَّرِيقَ [for أَخَافَ اللُّصُوصُ أَهْلَ الطَّرِيقِ The robbers caused the people of the road, or the passengers thereof, to fear, &c.; or it may be
rendered the robbers caused the road to be insecure]. (Msb.) And أَخَفْتُهُ الأَمْرَ فَخَافَهُ [I caused
him to fear the thing, or affair, &c., and he
feared it; making the verb doubly trans.]; as
also إِيَّاهُ فَتَخَوَّفَهُ ↓ خَوَّفْتُهُ. (Msb.) It is said in a
trad., أَخِيفُوا الهَوَامَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ تُخِيفَكُمْ Make ye the
venomous reptiles and the like to fear before they
make you to fear; (TA;) i. e. kill ye them before they kill you. (JM, TA.) ―
-b2-  مَا أَخْوَفَنِى
عَلَيْكَ [How greatly do I fear for thee!]. (TA.)
5
تخوّفهُ: see 1, in three places.
-A2-  Also He
took by little and little (S, L, K) from it, (S, K,)
or from its sides; (L;) as also تحوّفهُ: (S and
K * in arts. حوف and حيف:) or he took from its
extremities; so in the A; in which it is said to
be tropical: accord. to IF, it is originally [تخوّن,]
with ن [in the place of the ف]. (TA.) Dhu-rRummeh says, (S,) or not he, but some other
poet, for it is ascribed to several different authors,
(L,)
تَخَوَّفَ الرَّحْلُ مِنْهَا تَامِكًا قَرِدًا
كَمَا تَخَوَّفَ ظَهْرَ النَّبْعَةِ السَّفَنُ
[Her saddle abraded from a long and high, compact hump, like as when the piece of skin used for
smoothing arrows has abraded from the back of a
rod of the tree called نبعة]. (S. [See also 5 in
art. حوف, where another reading of this verse is
given. In the TA, in the present art., in the
places of الرحل and ظهر, I find السَّيْرُ and عُود.])
Hence, (S, K,) accord. to Fr, (TA,) أَوْيَأَخَذِهِمْ
عَلَى تَخَوُّفٍ, (S, K,) in the Kur [xvi. 49], (S,)
which Az explains as meaning [Or are they
secure from his destroying them] by causing them
to suffer loss [by little and little] in their bodies
and their possessions, or cattle, and their fruits:
or, accord. to Zj, it may mean, after causing
them to fear, by destroying a town, so that the
one next to it shall fear. (TA.) You say also,
تخوّف مِنْ مَالِى He took by little and little from
my property. (JK.) And تَخَوَّفَنَا السَّنَةُ [The
year of drought, or sterility, took from us by
little and little]. (JK.) And تَخَوّفَنِى حَقِّى
[He diminished to me by little and little my
right, or due]. (JK.) And تَخَوَّفَهُ حمْقُهُ (tropical:)  i. q.
اهْضَمَهُ [an evident mistranscription for اِهْتَضَمَهُ or
هَضَمَهُ, meaning His stupidity deprived him of
his right, or due]. (TA.)
خَافٌ A man very fearful or timorous; (S, K;)
[and so, in the present day, ↓ خَوَّافٌ; the former
originally] of the measure فَعِلٌ, like فَرِقٌ and فَزِعٌ;
and similar to صَاتٌ, meaning a man “ having a
strong, or loud, voice: ” (S:) or i. q. ↓ خَائِفٌ:
(TA:) accord. to Kh, it may be [originally
خَاوِفٌ,] of the measure فَاعِلٌ, having the medial
radical rejected; or [خَوْفٌ,] of the measure فَعْلٌ;
and in either case, the dim. is [↓ خُوَيْفٌ,] with و:
so says Sb. (TA.)
خَوْفٌ inf. n. of 1. (S, Msb, K, &c.) ―
-b2-  Also
Slaughter: whence, وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ بِشَىْءٍ مِنَ الْخَوْفِ
[And we will assuredly try you with somewhat of
slaughter]; (Lh, K;) in the Kur [ii. 150]. (TA.)
[See also 4.] ―
-b3-  And Fighting: whence, فَإِذَا جَآءَ
الخَوْفُ [But when fighting cometh; in the Kur
xxxiii. 19]. (K.)
-A2-  See also خَائِفٌ.
-A3-  Also A
red hide from which are cut strips like thongs,
(Kr, K, TA,) and then upon these are put [ornaments of the kind termed] شَذْر; worn by a girl:
(TA:) a dial. var. of حَوْفٌ [q. v.]: (K:) but
this latter is preferable. (L, TA.)
خِيفٌ: see 1, first sentence.
خَافَةٌ A [coat of the kind called] جُبَّة, of hide,
or leather, which the collector of honey wears;
(Akh, JK, K;) and also worn by the water-carrier: (JK:) or a fur-garment, or hide with
the fur or wool on it, worn by him who enters
into the places occupied by bees, in order that
they may not sting him: (TA:) or a [pouch of
the kind termed] خَرِيطَة, (S, K,) of hide, or
leather, (S,) narrow in the upper part and wide
in the lower part, (TA,) in which honey is collected: (S, K:) or a [round piece of leather with
a running string by means of which it may be
converted into a bag, such as is termed] سُفْرَة, like
the خَرِيطَة, made, or sewed, small, [for مُصْعَدَةٌ or
مُصَعَّدَةٌ, which I find in different copies of the
K, and to which no appropriate meaning is
assignable, I read مُصْغَرَةٌ or مُصَغَّرَةٌ, (see 2 in art.
صغر, and particularly أَصْغَرَ القِرْبَةَ,)] having its
head [or border] raised, for honey; (K;) so says
Skr, in explaining the following verse: or, as IB
says, accord. to Aboo-'Alee, it is from the phrase
النَّاسُ أَخْيَافٌ, meaning “ men,” or “ the people,”
“ are different, one from another; ” for it is a
خَرِيطَة of hide, or leather, embellished with different kinds of embellishment; and if so it should
be mentioned in art. خيف: (TA:) [but] the
dim. is ↓ خُوَيْفَةٌ. (JK.) Aboo-Dhu-eyb says,
[describing a collector of wild honey,]
تَأَبَّطَ خَافَةً فِيهَا مِسَابٌ
فَأَصْبَحَ يَقْتَرِى مَشَدًا بِشِيقِ
(S,) [He put beneath his armpit a خافة in which
was a receptacle for honey, and betook himself to
making successive endeavours to reach the most
difficult part of a mountain by means of a rope,
or rope of palm-fibres; for] he means شِيقًا بِمَسَدٍ;
the phrase being inverted: (S and TA in art.
شيق:) or he means, [betook himself to] taking
successive holds of a rope (يَتَتَبَّعُ حَبْلًا) tied to a
شيق [here best rendered mountain-top] in his
descent to the place of the honey; so that there is
no inversion. (TA in that art.) ―
-b2-  Also i. q.
عَيْبَةٌ [A kind of basket, or receptacle, of hide, or
leather]; (TA;) the thing in which fruits are
gathered; also called مِخْرَفٌ. (Har p. 374.) ―
-b3-
And خَافَةُ الزَّرْعِ is said to mean The envelope of
the grain of seed-produce; so called because it
protects it: to this the believer is likened in a
trad. [as some relate it]; but the reading [commonly known] is [خَامَة,] with م. (TA.) [See
خامة, in art. خيم.]
خِيفَةٌ; pl. خِيفٌ: see 1, first sentence. ―
-b2-  [Sometimes it may mean, agreeably with analogy, A
kind of fear.]
-A2-  See also art. خيف.
خَوَافٌ Vociferation, clamour, or a confused
noise, of a company of men. (JK, Sgh, K.)
خُوَيْفٌ: see خَافٌ.
خُوَيْفَةٌ: see خَافَةٌ.
خَوَّافٌ: see خَافٌ. ―
-b2-  [Hence, perhaps,] A certain black bird: ISd says, I know not why it is
thus called. (TA.)
خَائِفٌ Fearing; being afraid or frightened or
terrified: (S, * TA:) pl. خُوَّفٌ (S, K) and خُيَّفٌ,
(S,) or خِيَّفٌ, (K,) or, accord. to Ks, خُيَّفٌ and
خِيفٌ and خُوفٌ, (L,) [but the second and third of
these three should be خِيَّفٌ and خُوَّفٌ, for all are
said to be of the measure فُعَّلٌ,] and ↓ خَوْفٌ;
or this last is a quasi-pl. n.; (K;) whence, in the
Kur [vii. 54], خَوْفًا وَطَمَعًا, meaning Worship ye
Him fearing his punishment and eagerly desiring
his recompense. (TA.) See also خَافٌ. ―
-b2-  And
see مَخُوفٌ.
طَرِيقٌ مُخَافٌ [for مُخَافٌ أَهْلُهُ, A road of which
the people, or passengers, are caused to fear, by
robbers]. (Msb.) [See also what next follows.])
طَرِيقُ مَخُوفٌ A road in which people fear:
(S, * Msb, K:) or a road that is feared; (JK,
TA;) as also ↓ مَخِيفٌ, and ↓ خَائِفٌ; which last
is tropical, of the measure فَاعِلٌ in the sense of the
measure مَفْعُولٌ; (TA;) or, thus applied, this
last [is a possessive epithet, and thus] means
having fear: (JK: [see also مُخَافٌ:]) you
should not say ↓ طَرِيقٌ مُخِيفٌ, because the road
does not cause fear, but only he who robs and
slays therein. (S, * K, * TA.) One says also ثَغْرٌ
↓ مَخِيفٌ and ↓ مُتَخَوَّفٌ An enemies' frontier [that
is feared, or] from which one fears, or from the
direction of which fear comes. (TA.) مَخُوفٌ
signifies A thing [of any kind] that is feared; as
a lion, and a serpent, and fire, and the like. (Har
p. 369.) [Hence,] حَائِطٌ مَخُوفٌ A wall of which
the falling is feared. (Lh, Msb, TA. [See also
مُخِيفٌ.]) And وَجَعٌ مَخُوفٌ [A pain that is
feared]. (TA. [See, again, مُخِيفٌ.]) And
أَمْرٌ مَخُوفٌ [An affair, or event, that is feared].
(Mgh, Msb. [See, again, مُخِيفٌ.]) And فَاسِقٌ
مَخُوفٌ عَلَى مَالِهِ A transgressor who is feared
for his property, that he will consume it, and expend it in that which is not right. (Mgh.)
مَخِيفٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
two places: and see also what next follows.
حَائِطٌ مُخِيفٌ (Msb, K, in the CK ↓ مَخِيفٌ,)
A wall that causes one to fear that it will fall.
(Msb, K. * [See also مَخُوفٌ.]) And وَجَعٌ مُخِيفٌ
(S, K) A pain that causes him who sees it to fear.
(S. [See, again, مَخُوفٌ.]) And أَمْرٌ مُخِيفٌ An
affair, or event, that is formidable; that causes
him who sees it to fear. (Msb. [See, again,
مَخُوفٌ.]) And المُخِيفُ means The lion, (K,
TA,) that frightens him who sees him. (TA.)
See also مَخُوفٌ, first sentence.
أَخْوَفٌ [More, and most, formidable, fearful,
or feared: anomalous, like its syn. أَخْشَى, being
from the pass. verb. Hence,] أَخْوَفُ مَا أَخَافُ
عَلَيْكُمْ كَذَا [The most formidable, or fearful, of
what I fear for you is such a thing]. (Mgh, *
TA.)
مَخَافَةٌ an inf. n. of 1, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) originally مَخْوَفَةٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Also A cause of fear:
a word of the same category as مَجْبَنَةٌ and مَبْخَلَةٌ
&c.: pl. مَخَاوِفُ. Hence,] أَوَّلُ كُتُبِهِ المَخَاوِفُ
[The first of his letters, or epistles, consisted of
the causes of fear]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And مَخَاوِفُ also
signifies Places of fear. (KL.)
مُتَخَوَّفٌ: see مَخُوفٌ.
