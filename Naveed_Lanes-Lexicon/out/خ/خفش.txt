خفش1
خَفِشَ, aor.
خَفَشَ, inf. n. خَفَشٌ, He had that
quality of the eyes, or sight, which is termed خَفَشٌ
as this word is explained below. (Msb.) And
خَفِشَتْ عَيْنُهُ His eye had that quality. (A.)
خَفَشٌ Smallness of the eye, (S, A, K,) or of
the eyes, (Msb,) and weakness in the sight, by
nature: (S, A, Msb, K:) or a natural narrowness in the eye: (TA:) and sometimes it is a
disease: (S, Msb: *) or a corrupt state in the
eyelids, (Kh, A, K,) and redness, which causes
the eyes to become narrow, (Kh,) without pain,
(Kh, A, K,) and without ulceration: (Kh:) and
(so in the S and A and Msb, but in the K “ or ”)
nyctalopia; or the seeing by night, (S, A, K,) but
not by day: (S, K:) or the seeing by night more
than by day: (Msb:) and in a cloudy day, but
not in a clear one: (S, A, Msb, K:) and sometimes, (tropical:)  the being affected with ophthalmia, or
inflammation of the eye with pain and swelling.
(Msb.) كَأَنَّهْمْ مِعْزَى حَظِيرَةٍ فِى خَفَشٍ [As though
they were the goats of a pen, in respect of weakness of sight,] is a prov., applied to him who falls
into blindness or perplexity or the darkness of
night; because goats are the weakest of the غَنَم
in rain and cold: originally said by 'Áïsheh.
(TA.)
خُفَّاشٌ The bat; syn. وَطْوَاطٌ; (K;) a certain
flying thing; (Msb;) that flies by night: (S:)
so called because it can scarcely see by day;
(Msb;) or because of the smallness of its eyes
and the weakness of its sight (K, TA) by day:
(TA:) its brain, if the hollows of the soles
of the feet be anointed with it, excites the
venereal passion: and if burnt, and used as a
collyrium, it removes, or stops, (according to
different copies of the K,) whiteness of the eye,
(K, TA,) and sharpens the sight: (TA:) its
blood, if smeared upon the pubes of one who has
nearly attained the age of puberty, prevents the
growth of hair; (El-Minháj, K;) as some say;
but this is not true: (El-Minháj:) and if the
pudendum of her who has difficulty in bringing
forth, be rubbed gently with its gall-bladder, she
brings forth immediately: (K, * TA:) the pl. is
خَفَافِيشُ. (S, K.) [See also خُشَّافٌ.]
أَخْفَشُ One who has that quality of the eyes,
or sight, which is termed خَفَشٌ as this word is
explained above: (S, A, Msb:) and one who contracts his eyes when he looks: (TA:) and one
who has in his eyes white fluid matter, or motes,
or the like: (AZ:) fem. خَفْشَآءُ. (Msb.)
