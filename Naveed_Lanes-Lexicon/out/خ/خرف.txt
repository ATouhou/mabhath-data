us]. (Nh, O, K.)
خُرْفَةٌ Gathered, or plucked, fruits; (S, Mgh,
K;) and particularly of the palm-tree: (TA:)
and ↓ خُرَافَةٌ signifies the same. (Mgh, K, TA.

of the kind called قَطَانِىّ [i. e. pulse]: (AHn:)

or the male young one of the sheep-kind: or such
as has pastured, and become strong: (Lth, K:)
younger than the جَذَع: (Lth, TA:) so called
because it depastures from this place and this:
(Msb, TA: [see 1:]) fem. with ة: (K:) pl. (of
pauc., TA) أَخْرِفَةٌ and (of mult., TA) خِرْفَانٌ.
(Msb, K, TA.) The latter pl. is sometimes used
as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Young and ignorant persons; like
as كِبَاشٌ is used as meaning aged and learned
persons. (TA.) And hence the prov., كَالْخَرُوفِ
أَيْنَمَا اتَّكَأَ عَلَى صُوفٍ [Like the lamb: wherever
he reclines, he reclines upon wool]: (JK, TA:
but in the latter, اتّكى:) applied to him who leads
a soft and delicate life. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, (sometimes, S,) A colt; the male offspring of a mare;
when he has attained the age of six months, or
seven months; (S, K;) a meaning assigned to it
by As, in the “ Book of the Horse; ” but unknown to Abu-l-Ghowth: (S:) or, until a year
old: (ISk, K:) it is said by some to be applied
to a horse: in the L it is said that the خروف of
horses is such as is brought forth in the [season
called] خَرِيف: but Khálid Ibn-Jebeleh says that
it means such as pastures upon the [herbage of
the season called] خَرِيف: and Suh thinks that it
is an epithet applied to a horse, and any beast, as
meaning that depastures the trees and herbage.
(TA.)
خَرِيفٌ Fresh ripe dates, (K, TA,) or fruits [in
general], (S, TA,) gathered, or plucked; (S, K,
TA;) as also ↓ مَخْرُوفٌ. (S, TA. See also مَخْرَفٌ,
last sentence. [And see خُرْفَةٌ.]) ―
-b2-  And hence,
(tropical:)  Fresh milk; milk recently drawn from the
udder. (Hr, TA.) ―
-b3-  Palm-trees (نَخْلٌ) whereof
the quantity of the fruit that is upon them is
computed by conjecture. (K. [See also خَرَائِفُ,
voce خَرِيفَةٌ.]) ―
-b4-  [The autumn;] one of the divisions of the year, (S, Mgh,) the division (Msb)
[consisting of] three months between the end of
the قَيْظ [or summer] and the beginning of the شِتَآء
[or winter], (Lth, K, *) in which the fruits are
gathered. (Lth, S, Mgh, Msb, K.) ―
-b5-  And hence,
(Mgh, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  A year: (Mgh, K, TA:) so in the
saying, مَنْ صَامَ يَوْمًا فِى سَبِيلِ اللّٰهِ بَاعَدَهُ اللّٰهُ مِنَ
النَّارِ أَرْبَعِينَ خَرِيفًا أَوْ سَبْعِينَ, i. e. [Whoso fasteth
a day in the way of God, God will remove him
from the fire of Hell] to the distance of a journey
of forty years, or seventy. (Mgh: and similar
exs. are given in the TA, from three trads.: see
also an ex. voce إِنَّ.) ―
-b6-  Also The rain of the
season so called: (S, K:) or the rain, (JK,) or
the first of the rain, (K,) in the beginning of the
شِتَآء [or winter], (JK, K,) which comes at the
time of the cutting off of the fruit of the palmtrees: then follows the وَسْمِىّ, at the coming in of
the winter; then, the رَبِيع; then, the صَيْف; and
then, the حَمِيم: so says As: El-Ghanawee says
that the خريف is between the [auroral] rising of
الشِّعْرَى [or Sirius, which commenced, in central
Arabia, about the epoch of the Flight, on the
13th of July, O. S.,] and the [auroral] setting of
العَرْقُوَتَانِ [or الفَرْغَانِ, the 26th and 27th of the
Mansions of the Moon, commencing, in the same
region and period, on the 8th and 21st of Sept.,
O. S., and continuing thirteen days]: El-Ghowr
and Rekeeyeh [? (imperfectly written)] and El-
Hijáz are all rained upon by the خريف; but Nejd
is not: AZ says, the first rain is the وَسْمِىّ; the
follows the شَتَوِىّ; then, the دَفَئِىّ; then, the
صَيْف; then, the حَمِيم; then, the خَرِيف: and
therefore the year is made to consist of six
seasons: accord. to AHn, [who seems in this
matter to differ from most others,] الخريف is not
originally the name of the division of the year;
but the name of the rain of the قَيْظ [or summer];
and then the season was named thereby. (TA.)
[See also نَوْءٌ.] ―
-b7-  [Also The herbage of the season
so called, or of the rain so called; like as رَبِيعٌ
signifies the “ herbage of the season, or of the
rain, so called. ” So in the phrase used by Khálid
Ibn-Jebeleh (in explaining the word خَرُوف), مَا
رَعَى الخَرِيفَ Such as pastures upon the خريف.] ―
-b8-
Also, accord. to AA, (TA,) A rivulet, streamlet,
or small channel for irrigation. (JK, K, TA.)
خُرَافَةٌ i. q. خُرْفَةٌ, q. v. (Mgh, K.) ―
-b2-  Hence
خُرَافَاتٌ meaning Stories that are deemed pretty:
similar to فُكَاهَةٌ from فَاكِهَةٌ: (Mgh:) [or] خُرَافَةُ
was the name of a man, (S, Mgh, K,) of [the
tribe of] 'Odhrah, (S, K,) whom the Jinn (or
Genii) fascinated, (S, Mgh, K,) as the Arabs
assert, (Mgh,) and carried off, (TA,) and who
related what he had seen, (S, Mgh, K,) of them,
when he returned, (Mgh,) and they pronounced
him a liar, and said, (S, Mgh, K,) of a thing that
was impossible, (Mgh,) حَدِيثُ خُرَافَةَ [a story of
Khuráfeh]: (S, Mgh, K:) but it is related of
the Prophet, that he said, خُرَافَةُ حَقٌّ, (S, Mgh,)
meaning What Khuráfeh relates [as heard] from
the Jinn [is true]: (Mgh:) the ر is without
teshdeed; and the article ال is not prefixed,
because the word is determinate [by itself], unless one mean thereby خُرَافَاتٌ as signifying fictictious night-stories: (S:) or خُرَافَةٌ signifies a
fictitious story that is deemed pretty: (Lth, K:)
[and ↓ أَخَارِيفُ app. signifies the same as خُرَافَاتٌ,
as though its sing. were أُخْرُوفَةٌ, like as أَسَاطِيرُ
and أَحَادِيثُ, which have similar meanings, are
pls. of which the sings. are said to be أَسْطُورَةٌ
and أُحْدُوثَةٌ:] see 1, last signification.
خَرُوفَةٌ: see what next follows.
خَرِيفَةٌ and ↓ خَرُوفَةٌ A palm-tree (نَخْلَةٌ) of
which a man gathers, or plucks, the fruit for
himself and his household; as also ↓ مَخْرَفٌ:
(AHn:) or a palm-tree which one takes for the
picking up of its fresh ripe dates: (Sh, O, K:)
or the latter signifies a palm-tree of which the
fruit is cut off; being of the measure فَعُولَةٌ in
the sense of the measure مَفْعُولَةٌ: and the former
is said to signify one that is set apart for its
fruit that is [to be] gathered, or plucked: (TA:)
or a selected palm-tree: (JK:) and its pl. is
خَرَائِفُ: (JK, TA:) or خَرَائِفُ signifies palmtrees whereof the quantity of the fruit that is
upon them is computed by conjecture. (AZ, S,
K. [See also خَرِيفٌ.]) Also, the former, [A
palm-tree set in the manner described in the
following explanation:] one's digging, for a
palm-tree, in a water-course, or channel of a
torrent, in which are pebbles, until reaching hard
ground, and then filling up the hollow with sand,
and setting the palm-tree therein. (O, K.)
خَارِفٌ A keeper, or watcher, of palm-tree:
(K:) pl. خُرَّافٌ. (TA.)
أَخَارِيفُ: see خُرَافَةٌ; and see 1, last signification.
مَخْرَفٌ The place of the gathering, or plucking,
or cutting off, of fruit. (Msb.) A place of
abode of a people, or party, during their خَرِيف.
(TA. [It is there added, “as though formed
from أَخْرَفُوا, by the rejection of the augmentative letter: ” but it is rather to be regarded as
regularly formed, from خَرَفُوا: see 1.]) ―
-b2-  Also
A garden; (Mgh, TA;) and so ↓ مَخْرَفَةٌ: (S,
K:) or a garden of palm-trees; as also ↓ مَخْرِفٌ
and ↓ مَخْرَفَةٌ: (TA:) a single palm-tree: or a
few palm-trees, up to ten; more than these being
termed a بُسْتَان or a حَدِيقَة: (El-Harbee, TA:)
see also خَرِيفَةٌ: or a small collection of palmtrees, six or seven, which a man purchases for
the fruit that is [to be] gathered, or plucked: or
any collection of palm-trees: (L, TA:) or a
walled garden of palm-trees: (IAth, TA:) or
palm-trees [absolutely]: (Mgh:) and an avenue
between two rows of palm-trees, such that one may
gather, or pluck, the fruit from whichever of them
he will; (K;) as also ↓ مَخْرَفَةٌ: (Sh, K:) and,
(S, Mgh, K,) as also ↓ مَخْرَفَةٌ, (S, K,) a road,
(S, Mgh, K,) such as is conspicuous, clear, or
open: (K:) pl. مَخَارِفُ. (Mgh, TA.) It is
said in a trad., عَائِدُ المَرِيضِ عَلَى مَخَارِفِ الجَنَّةِ
حَتَّى يَرْجِعَ, i. e. The visitor of the sick is as
though he were in the gardens of Paradise until
he returns: or upon the palm-trees of Paradise;
gathering, or plucking, their fruits: or upon the
roads of Paradise: (Mgh, * TA:) or, as some
relate it, الجنّةِ ↓ على مَخْرَفَةِ. (TA. [See also
another explanation, and other readings in what
follows.]) And it is said in a trad. of 'Omar,
النَّعَمِ ↓ تَرَكْتُكُمْ عَلَى مَخْرَفَةِ, (S,) or تُرِكْتُمْ,
(TA,) i. e. [I have left you, or ye have been
left,] upon a conspicuous road, like the road of
the camels, (As, S, * TA,) which they have trodden
with their feet so that it has become plainly apparent. (As, TA.) ―
-b3-  Also Gathered, or plucked,
fruit of palm-trees: (As, A 'Obeyd, IAmb, K:)
a correct meaning, though IKt says that the
proper word in this sense is only مَخْرُوفٌ: it is
like مَشْرَبٌ and مَطْعَمٌ and مَرْكَبٌ as meaning
مَشْرُوبٌ and طَعَامٌ مَأْكُولٌ and مَرْكُوبٌ; and
may signify fresh ripe dates gathered or plucked:
(IAmb, TA:) pl. as above. (As, &c.) So in the
former of the two trads. mentioned above accord.
to As and A 'Obeyd: (TA:) and this interpretation
is corroborated by another reading, i. e., على
الجنّةِ ↓ خُرْفَةِ: (Mgh:) another reading is, فِى
الجنّةِ ↓ خِرَافِ: [see خَرَافٌ:] and another, لَهُ
فِى الجَنَّةِ ↓ خَرِيفٌ, i. e. [The visitor of the sick
shall have] gathered fruits in Paradise. (TA.)
مَخْرِفٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
مُخْرِفٌ: see 4.
مِخْرَفٌ The thing in which fruits are gathered;
(S, Har p. 374;) called by the Arabs خَافَةٌ:
(Har ib.:) a [basket of the kind called] مِكْتَل,
(Msb,) or زِنْبِيل, of small size, in which the best
fresh ripe dates are gathered: (O, K:) pl.
مَخَارِفُ. (A, TA.) One says, خَرَجُوا إِلَى المَخَارِفِ
بالمَخَارِفِ, i. e. They went forth to the gardens
with the baskets (زُبُل) [for gathering fruit]. (A,
TA.) ―
-b2-  And hence, (assumed tropical:)  The basket (زنبيل) in which
the importunate beggar puts his food. (Har ubi
suprà.)
مَخْرَفَةٌ: see مَخْرَفٌ, in six places.
مَخْرُوفٌ: see خَرِيفٌ.
-A2-  Also Rained upon by
the rain called خَرِيف; pl., applied to men,
مَخْرُوفُونَ: (TA:) [so, too, applied to a beast:]
and so, with ة, applied to land (أَرْض). (As, S.)
مُخَارَفٌ Denied, or refused, good, or prosperity;
prevented, or withheld, from obtaining good, good
fortune, or sustenance; (K;) i. q. مُحَارَفٌ; (JK,
TA;) as also مُجَارَفٌ. (TA.)
