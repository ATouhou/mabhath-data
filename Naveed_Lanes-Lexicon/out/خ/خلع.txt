إِنَّ اللّٰهَ سَيُقَمِّصُكَ قَمِيصًا وَ إِنَّكَ تُلَاصُ عَلَى خَلْعِهِ,

(TA.) And خَلَعَ قَائِدَهُ (tropical:)  [He divested his leader
of his authority; or removed him from his office;
or dismissed him]. (S, TA.) But IF says, This
is scarcely, or never, said, except of an inferior

that [خَلَعَهُ signifies, in a case of this kind, (tropical:)  He
threw off his allegiance to him; or forsook obedience to him; like another phrase, mentioned

خَلَعَ الأَمِيرُ وَالِيَهُ عَلَى بَلَدِ كَذَا [as meaning (assumed tropical:)  The

خَلَعَ امْرَأَتَهُ, (Az, S, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. خُلْعٌ, with
damm, (S, K, *) or this is a simple subst., (Az,

TA,) and some add خِلَاعٌ; (TA;) and ↓ خالعها,
(Az, TA,) inf. n. مُخَالَعَةٌ; (K;) [and خِلَاعٌ seems
to be another inf. n. of this latter verb, rather than

Msb, K) for a ransom given by her, (Msb,) or
for her property given by her as a ransom to
release herself from him, (Az, Mgh, TA,) or for
a gift, or a compensation, from her, (K, accord.
to different copies; some having بِبَذْلٍ; and
others, بِبَبَدَلٍ;) or from another: (K:) because
the wife is [as] a garment to the husband, and the

the fair, or festival, (TA,) يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ هٰذَا ابْنَى
قَدْ خَلَعْتُهُ, (K, * TA,) meaning [O men, this, my
son, I cast off, repudiate, or renounce, him, or]
I declare myself to be clear of him; so that if he
commit a crime, or an offence rendering him
liable to punishment, I am not responsible; and
if a crime, or an offence rendering liable to
punishment, be committed against him, I will
not pursue [for redress, or retaliation]; (TA;)
he was not punished afterwards for any such act
committed by him: (K, TA:) this was when the
person doing so feared some foul action or treachery from his son: and in like manner, they
said, إِنَّا قَدْ خَلَعْنَا فُلَانًا [Verily we cast off, &c.,
such a one]. (TA.) In like manner, also, خَلَعُوهُ,
inf. n. خَلْعٌ, signifies (tropical:)  [They cast him off, repudiated him, or renounced him, or] they declared
themselves to be clear of him; meaning a confederate; so that they should not be punished for
a crime, or an offence rendering liable to punishment, committed by him, nor should he be punished
for such an act committed by them. (IAth, L.)
In the same sense the verb is used in the saying,
نَخْلَعُ وَنَتْرُكُ مَنْ يَفْجُرُكَ [We repudiate, or renounce, or] we declare ourselves clear of, and
forsake, him who disobeys, or opposes, Thee:
(Mgh, TA:) or نَخْلَعُ وَنَهْجُرُ مَنْ يَكْفُرُكَ we hate,
