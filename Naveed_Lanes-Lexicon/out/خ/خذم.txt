خذم1
خَذَمَهُ, (S, K,) aor.
خَذِمَ, (K,) inf. n. خَذْمٌ, (JK,
S, TA,) He cut it, or cut it off: (S, K:) or he did
so quickly: (JK, Z, TA:) and ↓ خذّمهُ and
↓ تخذّمهُ signify the same: (K:) or ↓ the second,
inf. n. تَخْذِيمٌ, he cut it in pieces; (S, in which
only the inf. n. is mentioned;) and so ↓ the third.
(TA.) [It is like جَذَمَهُ.] Hence, in a trad.,
خَذَمُوا بِالسُّيُوفِ, said of men stopping the road,
and robbing and slaying passengers, They cut,
and smote, men with the swords. (TA.) And
خَذَمَ لَهُ مِنْ مَالِهِ خِذْمَةً He cut off for him a
portion of his property. (JK.) ―
-b2-  Also, said of
a hawk, He struck him, or it, with his talon, or
claw. (IAar, K. *)
-A2-  خَذِمَ, aor.
خَذَمَ, (K,) inf. n.
خَذْمٌ, (TK, [as indicated in the K by its being
said that the verb is like سَمِعَ,]) It became cut,
or cut off; as also ↓ تخذّم: (K:) [or] the latter
is quasi-pass. of خَذَّمَهُ [and therefore signifies it
became cut in pieces]. (TA.) And خَذِمَتِ النَّعْلُ
The [thong called] شِسْع [q. v.] of the sandal became cut, or severed. (TA.)
-A3-  خَذِمَ, aor.
خَذَمَ,
(K,) inf. n. خَذَمٌ (S, TA) [and app. خَذَمَانٌ, q. v.
infrà]; or خَذَمَ, [so in the JK, which may be
also correct, agreeably with the primary signification of this verb, though the aor. is there said
to be
خَذَمَ, which may perhaps be a mistranscription
for
خَذِمَ,] inf. n. خَذْمٌ [there mentioned in two places]
and خَذَمٌ; (JK;) (tropical:)  He was quick (JK, S, K,
TA) in pace, or rate of going; (JK, S, TA;) as
also ↓ اخذم. (JK. [But this last may be erroneously taken from the phrase مَرَّ مُخْذِمًا, there
immediately following; for this phrase may be
mistranscribed for مَرَّ يَخْذَمُ, which I find in the
TA.]) ―
-b2-  [And hence,] خَذَمٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  [The
being liberal, or bountiful; (see the part. n.
خَذِمٌ;) or] the giving a gift, or making a present.
(KL.)

q. v.)
خَذِمٌ A cutting, or sharp, sword; (K;) as
also ↓ خَذُومٌ (JK, K) and ↓ مِخْذَمٌ; (JK, T, S,
ISd, TA;) the last erroneously said in the K to be
