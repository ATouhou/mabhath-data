خزخَزٌّ A certain kind of cloth, (S, A, K,) well
known, (K, TA,) woven of wool and silk: (TA:)
and also a kind of cloth entirely of silk; and this
is the kind which one is forbidden to ride upon
and to sit upon; not the former kind, which is
allowable, and was sometimes worn by companions of the Prophet and by the next succeeding generation, as IAth has ascertained: (TA:)
derived from خُزَزٌ, (K, TA,) accord. to some:
(TA:) or it is the name of a certain beast
[thought by Golius to be the beaver]: and
afterwards applied to the cloth made of its fur:
(Mgh, Msb:) pl. خُزُوزٌ. (S, A, Msb, K.) [Golius
seems to derive it from the Persian قَزْ, meaning
raw silk; and assigns to it also the meaning of
a coarser kind of spun silk.] خُزُوزٌ وَبُزُوزٌ signifies
Good cloths, or stuffs, or garments. (A in
art. بز.)
خُزَزٌ The male of the أَرْنَب [or hare]: (S, A,
Msb, K:) or the offspring of the ارنب: (TA:)
pl. [of pauc.] أَخِزَّةٌ (K) and [of mult.] خِزَّانٌ.
(S, Msb, K.) Hence the saying, مَسُّهُ مَسُّ الخُزَزِ
[The feel of him, or it, is like the feel of the male,
or young, hare]. (A, TA.)
خَزَّازٌ A seller of خَزّ. (TA.)
أَرْضٌ مَخَزَّةٌ A land containing, (K * TA,) or
abounding with, (TA,) خِزّان, pl. of خُزَزٌ, (K,
TA.)
