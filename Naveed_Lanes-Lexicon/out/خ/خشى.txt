خَشِىَ, aor. يَخْشَى, inf. n. خَشْيَةٌ (JK, S,
M, Msb, K) and خَشْىٌ (JK, M, K) and خِشْىٌ
(Sgh, K) [the second and third erroneously written
in the CK خَشًا and (by indication) خِشًا] and
خَشَاةٌ (M, K) and خَشْيَانٌ, (JK, M, K,) though
it has been said that the only instances of this
kind are شَنْآنٌ and لَيَّانٌ, [see the former of these
two,] but in one copy of the M found written

مَخْشِيَةٌ, (M, K,) He feared; syn. خَافَ: (JK,
S, M, Msb, K:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib and
others, he dreaded; or feared with reverence,
veneration, respect, honour, or awe. (TA.) You
say, خَشِيَهُ He feared him, or it; [or he dreaded
him, or it; i. e. feared him, or it, with reverence,
&c.;] as also ↓ تخشّاهُ. (K.) [And خَشِىَ مِنْهُ,
meaning the same: or He feared, or dreaded,
what might happen to him from him, or it.
And خَشِىَ عَلَيْهِ شَيْئًا He feared, or dreaded, for
him a thing.] And فَعَلْتُ ذٰلِكَ خَشَاةَ أَنْ يَكُونَ كَذَا
[I did that in fear, or dread, that such a thing
might happen]. (IAar, TA.) ―
-b2-  خَشَيْتُهُ also signifies Hope. (Er-Rághib, TA.) And the saying
of Ibn-'Abbás to 'Omar, لَقَدْ أَكْثَرْتَ مِنَ الدُّعَآءِ
بِالمَوْتِ حَتَّى خَشِيتُ أَنْ يَكُونَ ذٰلِكَ أَسْهَلَ لَكَ عِنْدَ
نُزُولِهِ, is explained as meaning [Verily thou hast
prayed much for death, so that] I hope [that it
may be easier to thee when it happens]. (TA.)
―
-b3-  And sometimes خَشِيتُ means عَلِمْتُ [I knew,
or know]. (Msb.) So it is said to mean in the
saying of the poet.
وَلَقَدْ خَشِيتُ بِأَ مَنْ تَبِعَ الهُدَى
سكَنَ الجِنَانَ مَعَ النَّبِىِّ مُحَمَّدِ
[And I know assuredly that he who follows the
right direction shall dwell in the gardens of
Paradise with the Prophet Mohammad]: (S,
TA:) or the meaning may be, I hope. (TA.)

-b4-  In the saying in the Kur [xviii. 79], فَخَشِينَا
أَنْ يُرْهِقَهُمَا طُغْيَانًا وَكُفْرًا, the meaning is said, by
Akh, to be And we disapproved [that he should
make excessive disobedience, and ingratitude, to
come upon them twain]; (S;) and so says Zj, explaining it as the saying of El-Khidr: or, accord.
to Fr, the meaning is, and we knew. (TA. [See
also أَزْهَقَ.])

says, خَشِّ ذُؤَالَةَ بِالحِبَالَةِ, meaning [Frighten thou]
the wolf [with the snare]. (S. [See art. ذأل.])
And لَقَدْ كُنْتُ وَمَا أُخَشَّى بِالذِّئْبِ [Verily I used
to be in a state when I was not frightened by the
wolf]: a prov. (JK, TA.)

خَشْيَا, (S, Msb, K, [in the CK, erroneously,
خَشْيَآءُ,]) like غَضْبَى fem, of غَضْبَانُ, (Msb,) accord.
to rule, (TA,) and خَشْيَانَةٌ, mentioned by El-
arzookee, and thought by MF to be of the
dial. of Asad; (TA;) or this signifies a wo
man who fears, or dreads, (تَخْشَى,) everything;
(JK, TA;) so in the Tekmileh: (TA:) pl.
خَشَايَا, (K,) pluralized in a similar manner to
epithets significant of diseases, like حَيَاطَى &c.,

سَمُّ ذَرَارِيحَ رِطَابٍ وَخَشِىْ
[Poison of moist cantharides, and dry]; (S,
TA;) meaning وَخَشِىٍّ, suppressing one of the
two ىs by poetic license. (IB, TA.)
خَاشٍ: see خَشْيَانُ.
أَخْشَى meaning More [and most] fearful, or
feared, [or dreaded,] (S, K,) is anomalous, (K,)
being from the pass. [verb, like its syn. أَخْوَفُ].

place is more fearful, or feared, [or dreaded,]
