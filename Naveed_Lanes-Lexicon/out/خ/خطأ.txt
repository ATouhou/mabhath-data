خطأ1
خَطڤاَخَطِئَ is syn. with ↓ اخطأ, inf. n. إِخْطَآءٌ and
↓ خَاطِئَةٌ, (K,) which latter, mentioned by AAF,
on the authority of AZ, is extr. in the case of a
triliteral [unaugmented] verb, and more so in the
case of a quadriliteral [i. e. a triliteral augmented
by one letter]; (TA;) and with ↓ تخطّأ; signifying He did wrong; or committed a mistake,
or an error: (K:) [and if this and similar explanations be correct, خَطَأْ may be an inf. n. of
the first of these verbs, and a quasi-inf. n. of the
second and third:] or ↓ اخطأ and ↓ تخطّأ have
this signification: (S:) and خَطِئَ, aor.
خَطَاَ, inf. n.
خِطْءٌ and خِطْأَةٌ, (S, K,) signifies he committed a
sin, a crime, or an act of disobedience for which
he deserved punishment: (S, K: *) or he committed a fault or an offence or an act of disobe
dience [in an absolute sense]: (K, * TA:) or,
accord. to AO, (Msb,) or A' Obeyd, (TA,)
خَطِئَ, inf. n. خِطْءٌ, signifies he committed a fault,
an offence, or an act of disobedience, unintentionally; as also ↓ اخطأ: (Msb, TA:) or, as
others say, خَطِئَ means [he committed a fault,
&c.,] in religion; and ↓ اخطأ, in anything; intentionally or unintentionally: (Msb:) خَطِئَ, in
religion; and ↓ اخطأ, in calculation [&c.]: (As,
M, TA:) or, accord. to Ibn-'Arafeh, (TA,) you
say, خَطِئَ فِى دِينِهِ, (K, TA, [in a MS. copy of
the K and in the CK, * فى ذَنْبِهِ,]) and ↓ اخطأ,
meaning he pursued a wrong way in his religion,
intentionally or otherwise: (K, TA:) or خَطِئَ
signifies he committed an act of disobedience
intentionally; (Msb, TA;) so accord. to the
'Ináyeh, and the like is said in the A; (TA;)
and ↓اخطأ, he did wrong, meaning to do
right: (Az, Msb, TA:) [and this distinction is
agreeable with general usage:] accord. to AHeyth,
you say, خَطِئْتَ بِمَا صَنَعْتُهُ [Thou didst wrong, in
that which thou didst,] intentionally; and ↓أَخْطَأْتَ
مَا صَنَعْتَهُ [or بِمَا صنعتة or فِيمَا صنعته Thou didst
wrong, in that which thou didst,] unintentionally.

خطّأهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَخْطِئَةٌ and تَخْطِىْءٌ,
(S, K,) He said to him, أَخْطَأْتَ [meaning Thou
hast done wrong, or committed a mistake or an
error]: (S, Msb, K:) or he pronounced him, or
asserted him, to be doing wrong, or committing a
mistake or an error. (Msb.) You say, إِنْ
أَخْطَأْتُ فَخَطِّئْنِى [If I do wrong, &c., tell me
that I have done so]. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also He made it
to miss: so in the saying, خَطَّأَ اللّٰهُ نَوْءَهَا God
made, or may God make, its [i. e. a land's] star,
or asterism, to miss; so that the rain which the
star or asterism should have brought did not, or
shall not, fall upon it. (TA.) This was [also]
said by I'Ab [in a tropical sense] with reference
to a woman, as an imprecation, in disapproval of
her conduct. (Mgh.) As some relate this saying,
the verb is خَطَّى, (Mgh, TA,) and the meaning,
God made, or may God make, its [rain-giving]
star or asterism, to pass it over, and not send
rain upon it: and in this case it may be, (TA,)
or it is, (Mgh,) from خَطِيطَةٌ, signifying “ a land
not rained upon (Mgh, TA) between two lands
that have been rained upon; ” (Mgh;) the verb
being originally خَطَّطَ, and the final ط being
changed into ى. (Mgh, TA. [See art خط.])
نَوْء is [here] the sing. of أَنْوَآءٌ meaning the “ Mansions of the Moon,” also called the “ stars, or
asterisms, of rain. ” (Mgh.) [See more in the
first paragraph of art. خط: and see also 4 in the
present art.] Accord. to Fr, خَطَّى السَّهْمَ and
خَطَّأَهُ are syn. [as meaning He made the arrow
to pass over, or to miss, the mark]. (TA.) One
says also, خُطِّئُ عَنْكَ السُّوْءُ [May evil be made to
miss thee;] i. e. may evil be repelled from thee.
(ISk.) And خَطَّأَ عَنْكَ السُّوْءُ [app. for ↓تَخَطَّأَ]
Evil missed thee, or may evil miss thee. (AZ.)

اخطأ, inf. n. إِخْطَآءٌ and خَاطِئَةٌ: see 1, in
eight places. أَخْطَيْتُ, for أَخْطَأْتُ, should not be
said: (S:) it is a word of weak authority; or a
mispronunciation: (K:) but some use it; (S,
Sgh, TA;) because a change of this kind is generally allowed by some of the writers on inflection. (TA.) See also 5.
-A2-  اخطأهُ, (S, K,) which
signifies, He [or it] missed, or failed of hitting,
it [or him], (TA,) and ↓تخاطأهُ (S, K) and
↓تخطّأهُ (K) and لَهُ ↓تخطّأ (TA) [and ↓خَطِئَهُ,
as will be seen from what follows,] are syn. (S,
K, TA.) [See also 2, last sentence.] You say,
اخطأ الرَّامِى الغَرَضَ The archer, or thrower,
missed the mark; or failed of hitting it. (TA.)
And اخطأهُ السَّهْمُ The arrow [missed it, or him,
or] passed beyond it, or him: and you may also say,
أَخْطَاهُ, suppressing the ء (Msb.) And اخطأ
الطَّرِيقَ [He missed the way; or] he deviated
from the way. (TA.) And اخطأ نَوْؤُهُ [(assumed tropical:)  His star,
or asterism, missed]; said of him who has sought
an object of want and not succeeded in attaining
it: (TA:) and to a person in this case one says,
اخطأ نَوْؤُكَ [(assumed tropical:)  Thy star, or asterism, has missed].
(Mgh. [See also 2.]) And اخطأهُ The
right, or due, was, or became, [out of his reach,]
or far from him. (Msb.) Owfà Ibn-Matar ElMázinee says,
النَّبْلُ أَحْشَآءَهُ↓تَخَاطَأَتِ
[meaning The arrows missed his bowels]. (S.)
And AO, (S,) or A' Obeyd, (TA,) says that
↓خَطِئَ and اخطأ are syn.; citing, as an ex., the
saying of Imra-el-Keys,
يَا لَهْفَ هِنْدٍ إِذْ خَطِئْنَ كَاهِلَا
(S, TA,) meaning [O the grief of Hind,] when
they (the troop of horse) missed the sons of
Káhil; (TA;) خطئن being here used in the
sense of أَخْطَأْنَ, (S, TA,) which latter, accord. to
Az, is the more proper in this case. (TA.)
-A3-
مَا أَخْطَأَهُ is an expression of wonder [meaning
How sinful, or criminal, or intentionally-disobedient, or intentionally-wrongdoing, is he !] from
خَطِئَ, not from أَخْطَأَ. (S.)

المَسْأَلَةِ He addressed to him the question with the
desire of causing him to make a mistake: (TA:)

خَطَأٌ A wrong action; a mistake, or an error;
contr. of صَوَابٌ; as also ↓خَطَآءٌ (S, Msb, K) and
↓خَطْءٌ: (K:) accord. to some, it is syn. with
خَطِيْئَةٌ and خِطْءٌ; and is an inf. n. used as a simple subst; but accord. to others, (TA,) it signifies an unintentional fault or offence or disobedience; (K, TA;) a subst. from أَخْطَأَ: (M,
Msb: [see 1, first sentence:]) and accord. to the
M, ↓خَطَآءٌ is a subst. from خَطِئ [and therefore
syn. with خَطِيْئَةٌ accord. to the general acceptation
of خَطِئَ]. (TA.)

the rain misses, while it falls upon another near

being allowable in this and in similar cases, (S,
TA,) A fault, an offence, or an act of disobedience; (S, K;) or such as is intentional; (K;)
like ↓خِطْءٌ, (S, K;) which is an inf. n., thus used
as a subst.; (Msb;) meaning a sin, a crime,
or an act of disobedience for which one deserves
punishment: (S:) pl. خَطَايَا, (Lth, S, K,) originally خَطَائِئُ; (Lth, S;) and خَطَائِى also, (K,
TA, [in a MS. copy of the K خَطَائِئُ,]) or this
is [anomalous and] incorrect, unless with the
art. ال, being otherwise خَطَآءٌ; (MF;) and
خَطَائِىُّ, [an anomalous pl.,] of which Th gives
an ex. in the following verse, related to him by
IAar;
لِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مَا قَدَّمَتْ نَفْسُهُ لَهُ
خَطَائِيُّهَا إِنْ أَخْطَأَتْ وَصَوَابُهَا

actions, if it have done wrong; and its right
action]. (L.) ―

[
مَتَخَطِّىٌ signifies the same as مُتَخَطٍّ, or nearly
so: and hence the saying,] نَاقَتُكَ مِنَ المُتَخَطِّئَاتِ
الجيف, (TA in the present art.,) or نَاقَتُكَ هٰذِهِ
مِنَ المُتَخَطِّيَاتِ الجيف, [the last word being app.

this thy she-camel, is of those that step over the
