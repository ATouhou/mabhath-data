made himself gentle, easy to deal with, compliant,
or obsequious. (TA.) It is said in the Kur
[xv. 88], وَاخْفِضْ خَنَآحَكَ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ (tropical:)  And make
thyself gentle, &c., to the believers: (Jel, TA:)
or be thou condescending to the believers, and
treat them with gentleness. (Bd.) And again, in

الذُّلِّ مِنَ الرَّحْمَةِ (tropical:)  And humble, or abase, thou
thyself to them both, from compassion: (Bd,
K, TA:) or make thyself submissively gentle to
them both, from compassion: (Bd, * Jel:) or

both, from submissiveness]. (O, K.) ―
-b5-  إِنَّ اللّٰهَ
يَخْفِضُ القِسْطَ وَيَرْفَعُهُ, in a trad., means Verily

of subsistence &c.] to whom He will, and maketh
scanty to whom He will: (Sgh, K:) or maketh
little the portion of the means of subsistence which
is the share of any created being, and maketh it
much. (TA in art. قسط, q. v.). خَفْضُ العَدْلِ
وَرَفْعُهُ is also explained as signifying The just's being

make me go a gentle pace, and another to make
me go a vehement pace, until I came unto you:
for خَفَضَ as relating to pace is probably not only
intrans., as it will be seen to be below, but also

land ceased not to make me go down, and another
to make me go up, &c.; though its being tropical
if having this meaning may be doubted]. (A,

[Verily the like of me, and verily the like of thee,
