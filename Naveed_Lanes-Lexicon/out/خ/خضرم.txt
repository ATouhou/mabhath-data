and so, [as some say,] a sea, or great river; but
its application as an epithet to a sea, or great river,
is disallowed by As: (S:) or a great sea: (K:) accord. to some, so called because of its greenness;

خِضْرِمِىٌّ: see الخَضَارِمَةُ.

الخَضَارِمَةُ A certain people of the عَجَم [i. e.
Persians], (S, K,) of the sons of Fáris, (S,) who
went forth [from their country] in the beginning
of El-Islám, and dwelt in Syria: (S, K:) i. e.,
those people who went forth at that period dispersed themselves in the countries of the Arabs;
some of them settling in El-Basrah, and these are
the أَسَاوِرَة; and some of them, in El-Koofeh, and
these are the أَحَامِرَة; and some of them, in Syria,
and they are the خَضَارِمَة; and some of them, in
El-Jezeereh, and they are the جَرَاجِمَة; and some
of them, in El-Yemen, and they are the أَبْنَآء; and
some of them, in El-Mowsil, and they are the

-b2-  Hence, as some say,
(Mz ubi suprá,) A man, (K, Mz,) or a poet, (S,
K,) who lived in the Time of Ignorance and in
that of El-Islám; (S, K, and Mz ubi suprà) as
though he were cut off from paganism to ElIslám; (Mz ubi suprà;) or from infidelity; (IB,
TA;) as Lebeed, (S, K, and Mz 20th نوع,) and
Hassán Ibn-Thábit, and Nábighah of the BenooJaadeh, and Aboo-Zubeyd, and 'Amr Ibn-Sha-s,
and Ez-Zibrikán Ibn-Bedr, and 'Amr Ibn-MaadeeKerib, and Kaab Ibn-Zuheyr, and Maan Ibn-Ows: (Mz 20th نوع: [see also إِسْلَامِىٌّ, and
شَاهِدٌ:]) or a person who passed half of his life
in the Time of Ignorance, and half thereof in
that of El-Islám: (K:) [I have generally found
the word thus written;] but IB says that, accord.
to most of the lexicologists, it is ↓ مُخَضْرِمٌ, with
kesr to the ر; for the pagans, when they became
Muslims, cut somewhat of the extremities of the
ears of their camels (خَضْرَمُوا آذَانَ إِبِلِهِمْ) as a
sign of their being Muslims in case of their being
attacked and plundered, or their being made war
with; (IB, TA;) and this they were ordered to
do in a manner different from that of the pagans:
(TA:) accord. to some, the epithet applied to a
poet of the class above mentioned is محضرم, with
the unpointed ح, [i. e. مُحَضْرِمٌ,] from الحَضْرَمَةٌ
signifying الخَلْطُ, [like الخَضْرَمَةُ, as shown
above,] because of his mixing paganism with
El-Islám: (Mz 49th نوع:) or مُحَضْرَمٌ: (K in
art. حضرم:) and in like manner IKh explains
the epithet ↓ مُخَضْرِمٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also A black
man whose father is white. (IKh, K. *) ―
-b4-  And
Deficient in respect of الحَسَب; (K;) meaning
not of generous parentage. (TA.) ―

father one who is not: (K:) and so مُخَضْرَمُ
النَّسَبِ: (S, TA:) or مُخَضْرَمٌ فِى نَسَبِهِ means of
mixed parentage. (TA.) One whose father is
unknown: [or, app., accord. to the TA, whose
parents are unknown:] or one sprung from [a
succession of] concubines. (K.) ―
