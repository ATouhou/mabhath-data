inf. n. خَشْفٌ, (S,) He, or it, made a sound, (L,
K,) or what is termed حِسّ [i. e. a low, faint,
gentle, or soft, sound], (S,) and an audible motion: (S, L:) said of a man: and said also of
snow, as meaning it caused one to hear a [sound

to IB, the right reading is, بِسُحْرَةٍ [a little before

made to be redundant, and because it is prefixed
to a verbal proposition: (S:) this is the more
approved way in a case of this kind, when the
verb commencing the proposition is a pret.; but
some say على حِينِ. (I 'Ak p. 199.) ―
