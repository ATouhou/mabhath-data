تَخَشْخَشَ: see خَشَّ فِيهِ.
-A2-  Also It
made a sound (S, K) such as is described below,
voce خَشْخَشَةٌ. (S.) 'Alkameh Ibn-'Abadeh says,
تَخَشْخَشَ أَبْدَانُ الحَدِيدِ عَلَيْهِمُ
يَبْسَ الحَصَادِ جَنُوبُ ↓ كَمَا خَشْخَشَتُ
[The short coats of mail of iron rustled upon them,
like as when a south wind has caused to rustle
the dry reaped corn]. (S.)
خَشٌّ: see مَخْشُوشٌ.
خَشَاشٌ: see خِشَاشٌ; for the former, in three places.
خُشَاشٌ: see خِشَاشٌ; for the former, in three places.
خِشَاشٌ The wooden thing that is inserted in
the bone of the nose of the camel, (S, A, K,) to
which the nose-rein is tied, in order that he may
be quickly submissive: (TA:) the بُرَة is of brass,
(S, TA,) or of silver; (TA;) and the خِزَامَة is of
hair: (S:) or the thing that is put in the nose;
and the برة is the thing that is put in the flesh:
(Lh:) or what is in the bone, when it is wood, or
a stick; and the عِرَان is what is in the flesh,
above the nose: (As:) a wooden thing, or stick,
that is put in the bone of the nose of the camel:
(Msb:) n. un. with ة: (S, Msb:) pl. أَخِشَّةٌ. (A,
Msb.) [Hence the saying,] جَعَلَ الخِشَاشَ فِى
أَنْفِهِ وَقَادَهُ إِلَى الطَّاعَةِ بِعُنْفِهِ (tropical:)  [He put the خشاش
in his nose, and drew him to obedience by his
violence]. (A, TA.) [And hence, also,] it signifies غَضَبٌ, (IAar, K,) as used in the saying,
حَرَّكَ خِشَاشَهُ, [lit., He put in motion his خِشَاش:
meaning, (assumed tropical:)  he roused, or excited, his anger; or]
he made him angry. (IAar.)
-A2-  الخِشَاشُ, and
↓ الخَشَاشُ, (S, K,) the latter form being sometimes used, (S,) which indicates that the former
is the more chaste, but, accord. to MF, several
authorities say the contrary, (TA,) and ↓ الخُشَاشُ,
(K,) or الأَرْضِ ↓ خَشَاشُ, (A 'Obeyd, Msb,) and
خِشَاشُ الأَرْضِ, (Msb,) The creeping things of the
earth: n. un. with ة, which is syn. with الحَشَرَةُ
and الهَامَّةُ: (Msb:) the حَشَرَات (A' Obeyd, S, K)
of the earth, (A' Obeyd, K,) and its هَوَامّ, and
[other] creeping things, (A 'Obeyd,) such as sparrows and the like: (A 'Obeyd, K: *) or خِشَاشُ
الأَرْضِ, and الطَّيْرِ, signify the small ones of beasts
or creeping things [of the earth], and of birds:
(A:) IAar is related to have said that it is
↓ خِشْخَاشٌ, contr. to what is said by the lexicologists in general: and these things are said to have
their appellation from their entering into the
earth and concealing themselves; but this assertion
is not valid: (ISd:) in a trad., for من خشاش
الارض, one relation substitutes ↓ مِنْ خَشِيشِهَا,
which has the same meaning: and some say that
it is ↓ خُشَيْش, a contracted dim. of خشاش; or
↓ خُشَيِّش, without contraction: (TA:) and
↓ الخَشَاشُ signifies the bad [meaning ignoble]
kinds of birds; this being with fet-h only: (As:)
or birds that do not prey: (IAar, TA voce
عُقَابٌ:) خِشَاشٌ, with kesr, also signifies the serpent of the mountain; which does not suffer one
to survive; and the أَفْعَى is the serpent of the
plain; (El-Fak'asee, K;) which like wise does not
suffer one to survive: (K:) or a great and
abominable ثُعْبَان: or a serpent like the أَرْقَم, but
smaller: or a small, tawny serpent, smaller than
the ارقم: (TA:) or a white serpent, which seldom
hurts, between the حُفَّاث and the ارقم: (Aboo-Kheyreh:) or such as is light, or active, and
small in the head, of serpents: explained also as
signifying the serpent, without restriction: (TA:)
and, (K,) or as some say, (TA,) such as has no
power of defence, [مَا لَا دِفَاعَ لَهُ, as in the CK
and a MS copy of the K, for which we find in
some copies of the K, and in the TA, ما لا دِمَاغَ لَهُ
such as has no brains, which is doubtless a mistake,] of beasts or creeping things of the earth,
and of birds, (K,) such as the ostrich, and the
[bustard called] حُبَارَى, and the كَرَوَان [or stonecurlew], and [the bird called] مُلَاعِبُ ظِلِّهِ, and
the [harmless kinds of] serpent: (TA:) or what
is small in the head, and slender, of beasts or
creeping things: and the kite; and [the bird
called] مُلَاعِبُ ظِلِّهِ: (Aboo-Muslim:) the pl. is
خشّآء [app. خُشَّآءُ, originally خُشَشَآءُ, unless a mistake for أَخِشَّآءُ, originally أَخْشِشَآءُ]. (TA.)
خَشِيشٌ, and خُشَيْشٌ, and خُشَيِّشٌ: see خِشَاشٌ.
خُشَّآءٌ The bone which is protuberant behind the
ear, (S, Msb, K,) and which is thin, and bare of
hair: (TA:) originally خُشَشَآءُ, (S, Msb, K,) of
the measure فُعَلَآءُ; (S;) [but masc., and perfectly
decl., as being quasi-coordinate to قُرْطَاسٌ, whereas
the original is fem., and imperfectly decl.; (see
قُوَبَآءُ;)] like قُوْبَآءٌ, which is originally قُوَبَآءُ; (S,
Msb;) and these two words are the only instances
of their kind: (ISk, Msb:) dual خُشَشَاوَان.
(S, K.)
خَشْخَشَةٌ The [clashing, clattering, chinking,
jingling, rattling, or rustling,] sound of arms, or
weapons, (S, A, * K,) and the like; (S;) as also
شَخْشَخَةٌ, but this latter is a dial. var. of weak
authority: (TA:) and of any dry or hard thing
rubbing against another such thing: (K:) accord.
to IDrd, such [sound or thing (for his words are
ambiguous)] is termed ↓ خَشْخَاشٌ: (TA:) and
the [rustling] sound of a new garment or piece of
cloth, when it is put in motion; as also نَشْنَشَةٌ:
(IAar:) and [a confused sound] such as is heard
to proceed from the inside of an animal on its
being hit by an arrow: (JK in art. خشف:)
and a motion having a sound like the sound of
arms, or weapons; (TA;) or an audible motion.
(Mgh in art. خشف.)
خَشْخَاشٌ A company: (ISd, TA:) or a numerous company of men: (Az, TA:) or a company
(S, K) in, (K,) or having upon them, (S,) arms,
or weapons, and coats of mail. (S, K.)
-A2-  See
also خَشْخَشَةٌ.
-A3-  Also A certain plant, (S, Msb,)
well known; (S, Msb, K;) [namely, the poppy;]
which is of several species; (K;) i. e., four;
(TA;) يُسْتَانِىٌّ [or garden-poppy,] (K,) which is
the white, and this is the most fit for eating, and
the best thereof is the fresh and heavy; (TA;)
and مَنْثُورٌ, (K,) which is the wild Egyptian;
(TA;) and مُقَرَّنٌ, [app. the horned poppy,] (K,)
the produce of which has an elongated extremity
like the horn of the bull; (TA;) and زُبْدِىٌّ,
[app. the spattling poppy,] (K,) which is known
by the name of بلبس [a word which I have not
been able to find elsewhere]: (TA:) every one
of these is soporiferous, and produces torpidness,
and cools: (K:) used as a suppository, it produces sleep: and the integument [of the capsule]
has a stronger power of producing sleep than the
seeds: (TA:) [or rather the seeds have no narcotic power:] from half a drachm of the integument, with cold water, as a draught, taken early
in the morning, and the like at sleep, has a wonderful effect in stopping a looseness characterized
by a mixture of humours and by blood, when
accompanied by heat and inflammation: (K:)
it is wonderful also that its solid part confines, and its juice relaxes: and when the root,
or lower part, is taken with water, [and boiled]
so that the water is reduced to half its quantity,
it is beneficial as a remedy for diseases of the
liver arising from thick humour: so says the
author of the Minháj: (TA:) the n. un. is with
ة: (Msb:) and the pl. is خَشَاخِشُ [app. a mistake for خَشَاخِيشُ]. (TA.) [See also أَفْيُونٌ.]
خِشْخَاشٌ: see خِشَاشٌ.
مَخْشُوشٌ A camel having a خِشَاش put in his
nose; as also ↓ خَشٌ. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
