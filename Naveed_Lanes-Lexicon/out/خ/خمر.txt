and in like manner one says of the beverage
called نَبِيذ [it became fermented]: (A:) or, said
of dough, and of clay, or mud, (طِين, as in the
K, but accord. to other lexicons perfume, طِيب,
TA,) and the like, it was left until it became
good [or mature]: (K:) and اختمرت الخَمْرُ the
wine became mature [and fermented]; (Mgh,

odour: (TA:) or became changed in odour. (S.)
10
استخمرهُ He made him, or took him as, a
slave: (S, Mgh, K:) of the dial. of El-Yemen.
(Mgh, TA.) [See 3.] So in the trad. of Mo'ádh,
مَنْ اسْتَخْمَرَ قَوْمًا أَوَّلُهُمْ أَحْرَارٌ وَجِيرَانٌ مُسْتَضْعَفُونَ
فَلَهُ مَا قَصَرَ فِى بَيْتِهِ [Whosoever hath made slaves,
or taken as slaves, persons the first state of whomhath been that of freemen and neighbours, regarded as weak, to him shall belong what he hath
held in possession in his house or tent]: (S, * L:)
i. e., hath taken them by force, and obtained possession of them: (S:) meaning, whosoever hath
made slaves, or taken as slaves, persons in the
Time of Ignorance, and then El-Islám hath come,
to him shall belong those whom he hath held in
possession in his house or tent: they shall not go
from his hand. (Az, TA.) Mohammad Ibn-Ketheer says, This is a phrase known to us in ElYemen, where any other is scarcely ever used [in
its stead]. (S.)
خَمْرٌ [Wine: or grape-wine:] what intoxicates, of the expressed juice of grapes: (ISd, K:)
or the juice of grapes when it has effervesced,
and thrown up froth, and become freed therefrom, and still: (Mgh:) or it has a common
application to intoxicating expressed juice of anything: (K, TA:) or any intoxicating thing, that
clouds, or obscures, (lit. covers,) the intellect; as
some say: (Mgh, * Msb: [but see what follows:])
and the general application is the more correct,
because خَمْر was forbidden when there was not
in El-Medeeneh any خَمْر of grapes; the beverage of its inhabitants being prepared only from
dates in their green and small state, or full-grown
but unripe, or fresh and ripe, or dried: (K, *
TA:) or the arguing thus, from this fact alone,
requires consideration: (MF:) AHn says, it is
(assumed tropical:)  sometimes prepared from grains: but ISd
holds this to be an improper signification: (TA:)
it is also sometimes applied to the (assumed tropical:)  beverage
called نَبِيذ, like as نبيذ is sometimes applied to
wine expressed from grapes: (L in art. نبذ:)
applied to (tropical:)  expressed juice from which خَمْر [properly so called] is made, [i. e., to must, or unfermented نَبِيذ,] it is tropical: it is so used in a
trad. in which خَمْر is said to have been sold by
[a companion of Mohammad named] Samurah:
خَمْر [in its proper acceptation] is so called
because it veils (تَخْمُرُ, i. e. تَسْتُرُ,) the intellect:
(K:) or because it infects (تُخَامِرُ, i. e. تُخَالِطُ,)
the intellect: (S, K:) [as though acting like
leaven: (see 1:)] so said 'Omar: (TA:) or
because it is left until it has become mature [and
fermented]; (K;) or until its odour has changed:
(IAar, S:) [see 8:] the proper application of the
root is to denote “ covering,” and “ commingling
in a hidden manner: ” (Sgh, Er-Rághib, TA:) it
is of the fem. gender, and sometimes masc.:
(Msb, K:) you say هُوَ الخَمْرُ as well as هِىَ الخَمْرُ:
but As does not allow it to be masc.: (Msb:)
and ↓ خَمْرَةٌ signifies the same: (K:) [or a kind
of wine:] or خَمْرٌ and خَمْرَةٌ are like تَمْرٌ and تَمْرَةٌ;
[the former a coll. gen. n., and the latter its n. un.;]
(S;) and خَمْرَةٌ [thus] signifies some wine; lit., a
portion of خَمْر: (Msb:) the pl. of خَمْرٌ is خُمُورٌ.
(S, Msb.) You say [also] صِرْفٌ ↓ خَمْرَةٌ [Some
pure, or unmixed, wine; using a masc. epithet,
contr. to rule]. (S.) ―
-b2-  [Hence the saying,] مَا
عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ خَلٌّ وَلَا خَمْرٌ, (S,) or مَا هُوَ بِخَلٍّ وَلَا خَمْرٍ,
(K,) (tropical:)  Such a one, (S,) or he, (K,) possesses
neither good nor evil: (S, K:) [or neither evil
nor good: for] AA says that some of the Arabs
make الخَمْرُ to be good, and الخَلُّ to be evil; and
some of them make الخمر to be evil, and الخلّ
to be good. (Har p. 153.) ―
-b3-  خَمْرٌ also signifies
(assumed tropical:)  Grapes; (AHn, M, K;) in the dial. of ElYemen:) (M:) like as عِنَبٌ signifies “ wine ”
in that dial. (AHn, TA in art. عنب.) It is said
in the Kur [xii. 36], إِنِّى أَرَانِى أَعْصِرُ خَمْرًا Verily
I thought myself pressing grapes: (ISd:) or the
meaning is, pressing out wine from grapes. (Ibn-
'Arafeh.)
خَمَرٌ A covert of trees &c.: (ISk, S, Mgh, K:)
or a place where the ground is eaten away by a
torrent, or an oblong tract of sand collected together and elevated, forming a place for concealment: (ISk, S:) and a hollow, or cavity, in
which a wolf conceals himself: and tangled trees.
(TA.) You say, تَوَارَى الصَّيْدُ مِنِّى فِى خَمَرِ الوَادِى
[The game, or wild animal or animals, concealed
itself, or themselves, from me in the covert, &c.,
of the valley]. (S.) And هُوَ يَدِبُّ لَهُ الضَّرَآءَ وَ يَمْشِى
لَهُ الخَمَرَ (assumed tropical:)  [He creeps to him in the thicket, or
place overgrown with trees; and he walks to him
in the covert of trees, &c.: see Freytag's Arab.
Prov. 913]: speaking of a man when he deceives,
or circumvents, his companion. (S.) And جَآءَنَا
عَلَى خَمْرٍ and ↓ على خِمْرَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  He came to us
secretly; unexpectedly; clandestinely. (K.) ―
-b2-

الطِّيبِ I experienced, or smelt, the odour of the
perfume. (S, A.)
