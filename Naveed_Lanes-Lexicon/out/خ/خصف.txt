خصف1
خَصْفٌ [inf. n. of خَصَفَ] signifies The act of
adjoining, and putting together. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence,
(TA,) خَصَفَ, (S, Msb, K, TA,) aor.
خَصِفَ, (Msb,
K,) inf. n. خَصْفٌ, (Msb,) He sewed a sole (S,
K, TA) [so as to make it double], covering, or
facing, one piece with another: (TA:) or he
patched a sole; mended it by sewing on another
piece. (Msb.) And He made anything double,
putting one piece upon another; he faced it.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And [hence,] خَصَفَ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ, (JK,)
or خَصَفَ الوَرَقَ عَلَى بَدَنِهِ, (S, * K,) aor. as above,
(S, TA,) and so the inf. n.; (TA;) and ↓ اختصف;
(S, K;) and ↓ اخصف; (K;) and ↓ خصّف, inf. n.
تَخْصِيفٌ; (TA;) (tropical:)  He stuck [or sewed] the leaves
together, one to another, (S, K, * TA,) and covered
his person with them, leaf by leaf, (K,) to conceal
therewith his pudenda: (S, TA:) or the first
phrase, (JK,) as also ↓ اختصف, (Lth, JK,) signifies he (a naked man) put upon his pudenda
wide leaves, (Lth, JK,) or the like: (Lth:) you
say, بِكَذَا ↓ اختصف [he covered his pudenda with
such a thing]. (Lth, JK.) It is said in the Kur
[vii. 21 and xx. 119], وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِنْ
وَرَقِ الجَنَّةِ; and ↓ يَخِصِّفَانِ, originally يَخْتَصِفَانِ,
by some pronounced ↓ يَخَصِّفَانِ, (S, TA,) and by
some, ↓ يَخْصِّفَانِ, with two quiescent letters together; (TA; [but this appears to be incorrect;
see 8 in art. خصم;]) and ↓ يُخْصِفَانِ, from
أَخْصَفَ; and ↓ يُخَصِّفَانِ, from خَصَّفَ; (Ksh and
Bd in vii. 21, and TA;) thus accord. to different
readings; i. e. (tropical:)  And they betook themselves to
sticking [or sewing] together, one to another, of
the leaves of Paradise, to conceal therewith their
pudenda. (S, TA.) And hence, also, the saying,
in a trad., إِذَا دَخَلَ أَحَدُكُمُ الحَمَّامَ فَعَلَيْهِ بِالنَّشِيرِ
↓ وَلَا يُخَصِّفْ, i. e. (tropical:)  [When any one of you enters
the bath,] let him take the waist-wrapper, and
not put his hand upon his pudendum: and like
this in meaning is تخصّفه [app. a mistranscription
for ↓ يَتَخَصَّفُ, or ↓ يَخِصِّفُ or the like, for يَخْتَصِفُ:
if not, it must be ↓ تَخَصَّفَهُ, meaning he put his
hand upon it]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  [Hence also the saying,]
فَمَا زَالُوا يَخْصِفُونَ أَخْفَافَ المَطِىِّ بِحَوَافِرِ الخَيْلِ
حَتَّى لِحِقُوهُمْ (tropical:)  And they ceased not to make the prints
of the feet of the camels to be covered by the prints of
the hoofs of the horses [until they overtook them];
as though they sewed these upon the others, like as

with another. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And خُصِفَتِ الكَتِيبَةُ مِنْ
وَرَائِهَا بِخَيْلٍ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [The body of troops] was followed [by horsemen]. (S.) ―
-b6-  And خَصَفَ, aor.

خَصِفَ,
(AZ, S,) inf. n. خِصَافٌ, said of a she-camel, She
cast her young one in the ninth month: (AZ,
S, K:) the epithet applied to her in this case is
↓ خَصُوفٌ: (AZ, S:) or, as some say, (S,) this
epithet signifies one that brings forth a year and
a month, (S, and so in some copies of the K,) in
[some of] the copies of the K a year and two
months, which is wrong, (TA,) after the time
when she was covered: (S, K:) جَرُورٌ is applied
to one that brings forth a year and two months
after that time: (S, TA:) or ↓ the former epithet
signifies one that brings forth on the completion
of the year: (IAar, TA:) or one of the camels
termed مَرَابِيع [pl. of مِرْبَاعٌ q. v.] that brings forth
at the completion of the year; or one of such
camels that brings forth when she comes to the

K) and another colour: (K:) or so called because of the rust of the iron &c.: (L:) or the

horsemen; and therefore the epithet is without ة,
because it has the signification of a pass. part. n.:

had said خَصِيفَةٌ, because it would in this latter
case have the signification of an act. part. n. (S.)
