a form heard by Ks; (S;) inf. n. (of the first,
TA) خَثْرٌ and خُثُورٌ and خَثَرَانٌ, (K, TA,) which

TA, or of the first, Msb, [or used as inf. n. of the
first because it is the most common form,])

write it, خُثَارَةٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  His soul [or stomach]
heaved, became agitated by a tendency to vomit,

is said in a prov., مَا يَدْرِى أَيُخْثِرُ أَمْ يُذِيبُ [He
knows not whether to leave in a thick state or to
melt]: (S K; in one copy of the former of which,
the fem. forms of the verbs are used:) applied to
him who is confounded, or perplexed, and unable
to see his right course, and who wavers, or vacillates: its origin being this: a woman melts fresh
butter, and what is thick thereof becomes mixed
with what is thin, and she is vexed and wearied
by her case, and knows not whether to raise the
fire with fuel, in order that it may become clear;
fearing that, if she do so, it will burn: thus she
is perplexed. (K.)
