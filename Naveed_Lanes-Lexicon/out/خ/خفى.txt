خفى1
خَفِىَ, (Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. يَخْفَى, (Msb,
K,) inf. n. خَفَآءٌ, (Mgh, Msb, K,) has two contr.
significations: (Mgh, Msb:) It was, or became,
unperceived or imperceptible, [or hardly perceived or perceptible, by any of the senses, or only
by the eye or ear, or by the mind; mostly] unapparent, or not apparent; (K;) [latent; obscure;] hidden, concealed, or covered; (Mgh,
Msb;) [or unconspicuous; but also faint, or
dim, to the sight; suppressed, or stifled, said of
the voice; or low, faint, gentle, or soft, to the
ear; and obscure to the mind, abstruse, recondite,
occult, or covert; and secret, private, or clandestine:] and the contr., i. e. it appeared; it was,
or became, apparent, open, manifest, plain, or
evident; (Mgh, Msb;) [as also ↓ استخفى: (see
مُسْتَخْفٍ, below:)] or, accord. to some, the particle
that connects it with its subject distinguishes one
meaning from the other: (Msb:) you say, خَفِى
عَلَيْهِ, aor. and inf. n. as above, (S, Mgh, Msb,
TA,) it (a thing, or an affair, Mgh) was, or became, unperceived or imperceptible, [&c., by
him;] unapparent, or not apparent, [or obscure,
&c., to him;] (TA;) or hidden, or concealed, from
him: (Mgh, Msb:) and خَفِىَ لَهُ it appeared to
him; it was, or became, perceptible, apparent,
open, &c., to him: [but see what follows:] (Mgh,
Msb:) whence the sayings of Mohammad, [app.
the Hanafee Imám,] referring to spoils, فَخَفِى
لَهُمْ أَنْ يَذْهَبُوا بِهَا وَيَكْتُمُوهَا أَهْلَ الشِّرْكِ, i. e. It appeared [to them that they should go away with
them, or take them away, and conceal them from
the believers in a plurality of gods], and خَفِىَ
لَهُمْ أَنْ يُخْرِجُوهَا إِلَى دَارِ الإِسْلَامِ [It appeared
to them that they should take them forth to the
territory of El-Islám]: but this is said only in
relation to that which appears from a state of concealment or from a hidden quarter. (Mgh.)
[Hence,] بَرِحَ الخَفَآءُ The affair, or case, became
manifest: (S, K:) or the state of concealment departed, or ceased; but the former explanation is better: or, as some say, ↓ الخَفَآءُ here signifies the secret;
and the meaning is, the secret became apparent:
(TA:) or, lit., the low ground became high and
apparent; meaning (assumed tropical:)  what was concealed became
revealed. (Har pp. 133-4. [See also art. برح.])
[And عَلَى خَفَآءٍ means Covertly, secretly, privately, stealthily, or clandestinely. (See also what
follows.)] ―
-b2-  خَفِيتُ لَهُ, aor.
خَفَىَ, (K,) inf. n. خُفْيَةٌ
and خِفْيَةٌ (Msb, K) and خِفْوَةٌ, (K,) the ى and
و being interchangeable, (TA,) signifies ↓ اِخْتَفَيْتُ
[i. e. I made myself unapparent to him, lurked,
or lay hid or in ambush, for him; cloaked, or
disguised, myself to him; hid, or concealed, myself from him]: (K:) [for] اختفى signifies he
hid, or concealed, himself, (Fr, * El-Fárábee,
JK, * Msb, K,) مِنْهُ from him; (TA;) as also
↓ استخفى, (Fr, * JK, * Msb, K,) and ↓ اخفى,
(IAar, K,) and ↓ تخفّى also is syn. with اختفى
[in this sense]: (Z, TA:) or you say, ↓ اِسْتَخْفَيْتُ
مِنْكَ, meaning I hid, or concealed, myself from
thee; but not ↓ اِخْتَفَيْتُ: (IKt, Th, S, Msb:) or
↓ اختفى in the sense of خَفِىَ is not of high
authority, nor is it disallowed, (Az, Msb, TA,)
but ↓ استخفى is more usual. (Az, TA.) You
say, فَعَلْتُهُ خُفْيَةً and خِفْيَةً [I did it covertly, secretly, privately, stealthily, or clandestinely].
(Msb) And قُتِلَ خفْيَةً and خِفْوَةً [He was slain
covertly, secretly, &c.]. (JK.) And يَأْكُلُهُ خِفْوَةً
[lit. He eats it covertly, &c.,] means he steals it.
(K.) In the saying in the Kur [vii. 53], اُدْعُو
رَبَّكُمْ تَضَرُّعًا وَخُفْيَةً, the meaning [of the last word]
is, Submissively, devoting yourselves to his service:
or, accord. to Zj, adhering to his service in your
minds: or, accord. to Th, celebrating Him in your
minds: or, accord. to Lh, in quietness, and stillness: (TA:) or secretly; and so in the similar
passage in the Kur vi. 63. (Jel, and so Bd on
this latter passage.) خُفْيَةٌ is from أَخْفَيْتُ الصَّوْتَ
[explained below in this paragraph]: (JK:) the
intrans. v. whereof is ↓ اختفى [signifying It (the
voice) was, or became, suppressed, or stifled; or
low, faint, gentle, or soft; like خَفِىَ, which is
more common]. (Lth, TA.)
-A2-  خَفَاهُ, aor. يَخْفِيهِ,
(JK, S, Msb, K,) inf. n. خَفْىٌ (JK, Msb, * K)
and خُفِىٌّ, (K,) also has two contr. significations:
(S, Msb, TA:) He made it perceptible, apparent,
open, manifest, plain, or evident: (JK, S, Msb,
K:) and he hid, or concealed, or covered, it; (S,
Msb, K; [in this latter sense, erroneously written
in the CK خَفّاهُ;]) as also ↓ اخفاهُ: (S, K:) or,
accord. to some, this latter has the latter meaning;
and the former verb has [only] the former meaning: but accord. to other, the reverse is the case:
(Msb:) or, accord. to Aboo-' Alee El-Kálee, the
former verb has the former meaning only; and
↓ the latter verb has both meanings: (IB, TA:)
↓ the latter is also explained as signifying he removed its خِفَآء, i. e. its covering: (TA:) and the
former, as meaning he made it to come forth from
a state of concealment: (JK:) and he drew it
forth; (K;) as also ↓ اختفاهُ. (S, Msb, K.) One
says, خَفَى المَطَرُ الفَأْرَ The rain made the rats, or
mice, to come forth from their holes. (S.) It is
said in the Kur [xx. 15], إِنَّ السَّاعَةَ آتِيَةٌ أَكَادُ
أَخْفِيهَا, (JK, TA,) or ↓ أُخْفِيهَا, (JK, S, TA,)
accord. to different readers: (TA:) the former
means [Verily the hour of the resurrection is
coming:] I am almost making it to appear:
(JK, TA:) and the latter, I am almost removing
that which conceals it: (S, IJ, TA:) or I almost
conceal it: (JK, TA:) or, as Ubeí reads it,
أَكَادُ أُخْفِيهَا مِنْ نَفِْسى [I almost conceal it from
Myself]: and Fr says [that the meaning is], I
almost conceal it from Myself, and how then
should I acquaint you therewith? (TA.) And
it is said in a trad. respecting the flight [from
Mekkeh], اخفى عَنَّا خَبَرَكَ [written without the
vowel-signs, so that it may be اِخْفِى or ↓ أَخْفِى,]
i. e. Conceal thou thine information from such as
may ask thee respecting us. (TA.) And in
another trad., كَانَ يَخْفِى صَوْتَهُ بِأَنِينٍ, thus with
fet-h to the ى, meaning He used to make his
voice perceptible [or audible, with moaning].
(TA.) And you say, الصَّوْتَ ↓ أَخْفَيْتُ [meaning
I suppressed, or stifled, the voice; or made it low,
faint, gentle, or soft]. (Lth, JK, TA.) [And
الكَلَامَ ↓ اخفى He uttered speech, or the speech,
in a low, faint, gentle, or soft, tone; he spoke in
a low, faint, gentle, or soft, manner; lit. he made
speech, or the speech, to be low, &c.]

the voice and the foot-mark of the woman [are
good, or pleasing, the rest, or the whole, of what
pertains to her is good, or pleasing]: (Yaakoob,
JK, S, K:) for when her voice is soft, or gentle,
