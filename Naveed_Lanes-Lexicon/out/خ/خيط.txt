خيط1
خَاطَ, (Msb, TA,) first pers. خِطْتُ, (S,)
aor. يَخِيطُ, (Msb,) inf. n. خِيَاطَةٌ, (S, TA,) or this
is a simple subst., (Msb, TK,) and the inf. n. is
خَيْطٌ, (TK,) which is said in the K to be syn.
with خِيَاطَةٌ, but this last is a mistake for خِيَاطٌ as
signifying “thread,” (TA,) or “a thread,” (AZ,
TA,) though خِيَاطٌ is also syn. with خِيَاطَةٌ, (TA,)
He sewed, sewed together, or sewed up, a garment,
or piece of cloth; (S, Msb, TA;) as also ↓ خيّطهُ,
inf. n. تَخْيِيطٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] خَاطَ بَعِيرًا
بِبَعِيرٍ (tropical:)  He coupled a camel with a camel [by
tying the end of the halter of one to the tail of
the other]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  خَاطَتِ الحَيَّةُ, (TA,) inf. n.
خَيْطٌ, (K, TA,) (tropical:)  The serpent ran along upon the
ground. (K, * TA.) ―
-b4-  ↓ خاط إِلَيْهِ خَيْطَةً (tropical:)  He
passed by him, or it, [or to, or towards, him or it,]
once: or ↓ خاط خَيْطَةً he passed along quickly:
(K, * TA:) and so ↓ اختاط and اِخْتَطَى. (K.)
It is said by Kr to be formed by transposition
from الخَطْوُ: but this is a mistake; for, were it
so, they would have said, خاط خَوْطَةً, not خَيْطَةً.
(ISd.) Accord. to Lth, وَاحِدَةً ↓ خاط خَيْطَةً
means (assumed tropical:)  He made his journey [or a journey]
without interruption. (TA.) In the A it is said
that ↓ خاط فُلَانٌ خَيْطَةً means (tropical:)  Such a one journeyed on, not pausing for anything: and in like
manner, خاط إِلَى مَقْصِدِهِ (tropical:)  [He journeyed on, not
pausing for anything, to his place, or object, of
aim]. (TA.)

تَخْيِيطٌ, (K,) means (tropical:)  Whiteness of the hair, or
hoariness, appeared upon his head (K, TA) in
streaks, or lines: (TA:) it is like وَخَطَ: (S,
TA:) or became like threads: (K:) and in like

Ibn—' Ámir El—Hudhalee says,
أَقْسَمْتُ لَا أَنْسَى مَنِيحَةَ وَاحِدٍ
حَتَّى تُخَيِّطَ بِالبَيَاضِ قُرُونِى
(S, TA) [I swear that I will not forget the loan
(here meaning the قَصِيدَة, Skr) of one (meaning
Abu—l—'Iyál [with whom he was carrying on a
controversy], Skr)] until the sides of my head
become streaked with whiteness: (TA:) but some
read تُخَيَّطَ; and Ibn—Habeeb says that خَيَّطَ الشَّيْبُ
الرَّأْسَ signifies (assumed tropical:)  Whiteness of the hair, or hoariness, became conjoined and continuous upon the
head, as though one part thereof were sewed to
another: (IB, TA:) some read ↓ تَخَيَّطَ; and
accord. to the K, you say, تَخَيَّطَ رَأْسُهُ بِالشَّيْبِ,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  His head became streaked, or marked
as with threads, by whiteness of the hair, or
hoariness: [the best reading seems to be تَخَيَّطَ,
for تَتَتخَيَّطَ:] and some read تَوَخَّطَ [for تَتَوَخَّطَ,
from تَوَخَّطَ as having the meaning here assigned
to تَخَيَّطَ]. (TA.)

(S, TA,) which last is explained by Z and IB as
meaning what comes forth from the mouth of the
spider: (TA: [the author of which says that,
accord. to this explanation, this term differs from
لعاب الشمس: but in so saying he seems to be in
error: both evidently signify gossamer:]) it was
applied as a surname, or nickname, to Marwán
Ibn-El-Hakam; because he was tall, and loose,
or uncompact, in frame: (S:) or it signifies the
air; syn. الهَوَآءُ [perhaps a mistranscription for
الهَبَآءُ, occurring in another explanation hereafter]:
(K:) or light entering from an aperture in a
wall [into a dark place] (Th, K:) or خَيْطُ البَاطِلِ
signifies the scattered هَبَآء [or atoms that are seen in
the rays of the sun] entering from an aperture
in a wall [into a dark place] when the sun is hot:
and one says, فُلَانٌ أَدَقُّ مِنْ خَيْطِ البَاطِلِ (tropical:)  [Such a
one is less in estimation than the scattered atoms
that are seen in the rays of the sun]; a prov.,
applied to him who is in an abject state; thus
related, on the authority of Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà,

أَرَقُّ مِنْ خَيْطِ بَاطِلٍ. (TA.) ―

K,) which is fixed in a mountain, in order that
one may let himself down [by means of a rope

Aboo-Dhu-eyb says, (S, TA,) describing the gathere of honey, (TA,)
تَدَلَّى عَلَيْهَا بَيْنَ سِبٍّ وَخَيْطَةٍ
بِجَرْدَآءَ مِثْلِ الوَكْفِ يَكْبُو غُرَابُهَا
(S, TA,) i. e. He let himself down [over against
it, meaning the place of the honey, partly] by
means of a rope (for so سِبّ signifies) and [partly
by means of] a wooden peg or stake [to which the
rope was attached, fixed] in a rock smooth like
the [leather termed] وَكْف, i. q. نِطَع, [the crow
of which rock would fall prone upon its face for
want of something therein to which to cling:]
(TA:) or (in the K “ and ”) خيطة signifies a
rope; (As, Az, K, TA;) [and if so, سِبّ here
means “ a wooden peg,” which is a signification
assigned to it in the K in art. سب:] or, accord.
to AA, a slender rope (S, L, TA) made [of the
bark] of the tree called سَلَب: (L, TA:) and
(accord. to some, TA) a string which is with the
gatherer of honey, (K, TA,) and with which he
pulls the rope [app. when he has detached himself
from the latter to gather the honey], it being
tied to him: (TA:) or a [tunic of the kind called]
دُرَّاعَة, [of leather,] which he wears. (Ibn-Habeeb,
K, TA. [In the CK, دُرّاعَةٍ is erroneously put for
دُرَّاعَةٌ.])
-A2-  See also 1, in four places. One says
also, مَاآتِيكَ إِلَّا الخَيْطَةَ (assumed tropical:)  I do not come to thee
save sometime. (TA.)
خَيْطَى: see خِيطٌ.
خَيْطَآءُ (tropical:) A she-ostrich long in the neck. (S, K,
TA.)
خَيْطَانٌ and خِيطَانٌ: see خِيطٌ.
خِيَاطٌ A needle; as also ↓ مِخْيَطٌ. (S, Msb, * K.)
Hence the saying in the Kur [vii. 38], حَتَّى يَلِجَ
الحَبَلُ فِى سَمِّ الخِيَاطِ [Until the camel enter into
the eye of the needle]. (S.) ―
-b2-  See also خَيْطٌ, in
three places. ―
-b3-  And see مَخِيطٌ.
خِيَاطَةٌ The art of sewing. (Msb, TA.) [See
also 1.]
خَيَّاطٌ A seamster; one whose occupation is that
of sewing; (Msb, K;) as also ↓ خَائِطٌ (K) and

tailor.] ―

(TA.)
خَائِطٌ: see خَيَّاطٌ.
مَخِيطٌ and ↓ مَخْيُوطٌ A garment, or piece of
cloth, sewed: (S, Msb, K:) the ى in the former
is the و of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, changed into ى
because of its being quiescent and the preceding
letter's being with kesr; the letter preceding it
being made movent because it and the و are
quiescent after the ى has fallen out; [for by
dropping the ى it becomes changed from مَخْيُوطٌ
to مَخْوْطٌ;] and it is made movent with kesr [and
thus changed from مَخْوْطٌ to مَخِوْطٌ, which necessarily becomes مَخِيطٌ,] in order to its being
known that the letter which has dropped out is
ى: some say that the ى in مَخِيطٌ is the radical,
and that the letter thrown out is the و of the
measure مَفْعُولٌ, in order that the word with و
[for its medial radical] may be known from that
with ى; [so that it is changed from مَخْيُوطٌ to
مَخْيُطٌ, and then to مَخْيْطٌ, and then to مَخِيطٌ;]
but the former saying is the right, because the و
is a formative augment, and it is not proper that
such should be thrown out. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also, the
former, (assumed tropical:)  The whole of the exterior of the belly.
(ISh.) ―
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:) A place of passage; (O, L, TA;)
a meaning erroneously assigned in the K to ↓ خِيَاطٌ
and ↓ مَخْيَطٌ: (TA:) and particularly, (tropical:)  of a serpent; (TA;) the place of creeping along of a
serpent. (K, TA.)
