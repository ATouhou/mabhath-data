خَامَةٌ belongs to the present art., and J has
erred, (K,) in mentioning it in art. خوم: (TA:)
[but why this is said, I know not; nor do the
commentators on this passage, as is observed in
the TA, give any explanation of it worthy of
notice:] it signifies A fresh, or juicy, plant: (S,
Msb: both in art. خوم:) or an ear of corn:
(IAar, TA:) or a shoot of seed-produce when it
first grows forth upon a single stalk: (JK:) or
خَامَةُ الزَّرْع signifies what grows forth, of seedproduce, upon a single stalk: (M, K: *) or the

الرِّيحُ مَرَّةً هٰكَذَا وَمَرَّةً هٰكَذَا [The similitude of the
believer is that of the fresh, or juicy, plant of

Fr related it differently, saying الحافة, [app. a
mistranscription for الخَافَة, which see in art.
خوف,] and explained this as meaning “ the
bunch ” of seed-produce. (TA.)
خَيْمَهٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,) with which ↓ خَيْمٌ
is syn., (S, Msb,) [though said by some to be a
pl., as will be seen below,] A بَيْت [here meaning booth, or the like,] (S, Msb, K,) of any kind
(K) such as is built, or constructed, (S, Msb, K,)
by the Arabs, (S, Msb,) of the branches of trees:
(S, Msb, K:) so says As, holding that the خيمة
is only of trees, and that otherwise it is called
بَيْتٌ [q. v.]: but others hold that it is [a tent;
i. e.] made with pieces of cloth and tent-ropes;
because تَخْيِيمٌ signifies the “ remaining, staying,
dwelling, or abiding; ” wherefore it is thus called,
as being used on the occasion of alighting: (IB,
TA:) this latter is the meaning commonly known;
but accord. to the saying of As, it is tropical:
(TA:) or, accord. to IAar, it is applied by the
Arabs only to a construction of four poles roofed
over with ثُمَام [or panic grass]; and is not of
cloths; (Mgh, Msb, TA;) the مِظَلَّة, he says,
being of cloths and of other things: or i. q. مِظَلَّة:
(TA:) accord. to AHát, the same as the Persian
خَرْ پُشْتَهْ [lit. “ ass's back; ” like the French “ dos
d'âne; ” meaning a high-pitched span-roof]:
(Mgh:) or any round بَيْت [which may here
mean either booth or tent]: or three poles, or
four, over which is laid ثُمَام; by means of which
one is shaded in the heat: (K:) or poles set up,
with rafters laid across, covered with trees; so
that it is cooler than are أَخْبِيَة [pl. of خِبَآء]: or
poles upon which خِيَام [pl. of خَيْمٌ] are constructed: or a construction of trees and palmbranches with their leaves upon them, which a
man uses for shade when he brings his camels to
water: and applied by the Arabs to a بَيْت [or
tent &c.], and a place of abode [in an absolute
sense]: (TA:) the pl. of خَيْمَةٌ is خَيْمَاتٌ and خِيَمٌ
(S, Msb, K) and ↓ خَيْمٌ, (K,) or this last is [a
coll. gen. n., or] syn. with خَيْمَةٌ, (S, Msb,) and
خِيَامٌ, (K,) or this is pl. of ↓ خَيْمٌ, (S, Msb,) and
is applied also to (tropical:)  [women's vehicles of the kind
called] هَوَادِج; these being likened to خِيَام [properly so termed]. (TA.) It is said in a trad.,
الشَّهِيدُ فِى خَيْمَةِ اللّٰهِ تَحْتَ العَرْشِ (assumed tropical:)  [The martyr
is in the tabernacle of God, beneath the empyrean: this signification of خيمة being perhaps
taken from the phrase

(جُرَز, [in the CK جِزَر,] of reaped seed-produce.
(K, TA.)
