It (the former) is as though it were taken from
تَخَلَّلْتُ القَوْمَ meaning “I entered amid the

لَا بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلَا خِلَالٌ, in the Kur [xiv. 36], is said
to mean [Wherein shall be no buying or selling]
nor mutual befriending: or [and no friends, or
true friends, for], as some say, خِلَالٌ is here pl.

it bears two contr. significations. (K.)
5

penetrated, or passed through, the خِلَال, i. e.

مِزَاجُهُ His constitution, or temperament, became
in a corrupt or disordered state. And اختلّ alone
He was, or became, disordered in temper; (see
تَحَمَّضَ;) but this seems to be from the same
verb said of a camel; (see اختلّت الأِبِلُ, below;)
for the camel becomes disordered in his stomach
by pasturing long upon خُلَّة, without shifting to
حَمْض. And اختلّ عَقْلَهُ His mind, or intellect,
was, or became, unsound, or disordered.] And
اختلّ أَمْرُهُ [His affair, or state, was,  or became,

اِضْطَرَبَ;) i. e. وَقَعَ فِيهِ الخَلَلُ. (JM.) ―

sentence. ―
-b4-  See also خَلَّ as syn. with أَخَلَّ or
أُخِلَّ &c., near the beginning of the first paragraph. [Hence,] اختلّ إِلَيْهِ He wanted it, or
needed it; (S, Msb, K;) namely, a thing; (S,
Msb;) as also اليه ↓ أَخَلَّ: (TA:) whence the
saying of Ibn-Mes'ood, عَلَيْكُمْ بِالعِلْمِ فَإِنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ

as خَمْرَةٌ is [said by some to be] of خَمْرٌ: (Aboo-Ziyád, TA:) see also خَلَّةٌ: the pl. is خُلُولٌ
[meaning sorts, or kinds, of vinegar]. (Msb.)
It is said in a trad., نِعْمَ الإِدَامُ الخَلُّ [Excellent,
or most excellent, is the seasoning, vinegar!].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] أُمُّ الخَلِّ [The mother of
vinegar; meaning] wine. (JK, TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence
also the saying,] مَا فُلَانٌ بِخَلٍّ وَلَا خَمْرٍ, (A'Obeyd,
JK, S,) or مَا لَهُ خَلٌّ وَلَا خَمْرٌ, (K,) or مَا عِنْدَ
فُلَانٍ خَلٌّ وَلَا خَمْرٌ, (S, in art. خمر,) Such a one,
or he, possesses neither good nor evil: (A'Obeyd,
JK, S, K:) [or neither evil nor good: for] AA
says that some of the Arabs make الخَمْرُ to be
good, and الخَلُّ to be evil; [and thus the latter is
explained in one place, in this art., in the K;]
and some of them make الخمر to be evil, and
الخلّ to be good. (Har p. 153.)

man and a camel. (TA.) Accord. to the K, it
also signifies A [young camel such as is termed]
فَصِيل: (TA:) but it means such as is lean, or
emaciated: (TA:) and so ↓ مَخْلُولٌ, applied to a
