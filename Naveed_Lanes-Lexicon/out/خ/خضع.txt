خضع1
خَضَعَ, aor.
خَضَعَ, inf. n. خُضُوعٌ (S, Msb, K)
and خَضْعٌ and خُضْعَانٌ, or خِضْعَانٌ, (TA,) He
was, or became, lowly, humble, or submissive, (S,
Msb, K,) لَهُ to him, (Msb, TA,) [for instance,]
to his creditor, (Msb,) or to God; (TA;) as
also ↓ اختضع, (S, K,) [and ↓ انخضع, (K in art.
خذأ,)] and ↓ اِخْضَوْضَعَ: (Sgh, K:) خُضُوعٌ is
nearly the same as خُشُوعٌ, except that the latter is
mostly used in relation to the voice [or the eyes];
but the former is used as meaning in the necks:
(Msb:) or the former is in the body, ('Eyn and
K in art. خشع,) and signifies the acknowledgment of humility and submission; ('Eyn;) and
the latter is in the voice and in the eyes. ('Eyn
and K ubi suprà.) It is said in a trad. respecting
the [devils'] hearing [the words of the angels]
by stealth, خُضْعَانًا لِقَوْلِهِ [With submissiveness to
his saying, or to what he said]; or, accord. to
one relation, خِضْعَانًا; but it may be a pl. of
خَاضِعٌ; and accord. to another relation, it is
خُضَّعًا, which is a pl. of خَاضِعٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  He
was, or became, still, (K, TA,) and tractable, or
submissive. (TA.) ―
-b3-  He made his words soft to
a woman; as also ↓ اخضع: (L:) or the latter
signifies his speech was soft to a woman. (O, K.)
It is said in the Kur [xxxiii. 32], فَلَا تَخْضَعْنَ
بِالقَوْلِ Then be ye not soft in speech. (TA.)
And you say, خَضَعَ لَهَا بِكَلَامِهِ وَخَضَعَتْ لَهُ وَتَطَمَّعَ
فِيهَا [He was soft to her in speech, and she was
soft to him, and he became excited to feel an
eager desire for her, or to lust after her]; (TA;)
and in like manner, ↓ خَاضَعَها, (K, * TA,) inf. n.
مُخَاضَعَةٌ, (TA,) [he was soft in his speech to her,
she being soft in her speech to him.] And خَضَعَا
بَيْنَهُمَا حَدِيثًا They two (a man and a woman)
made soft discourse together, saying that which
excited each to feel an eager desire for, or to
lust after, the other. (TA from a trad.) ―
-b4-  خَضَعَ,
aor.
خَضَعَ, inf. n. خَضْعٌ, [or, as in two copies of the
S, خَضَعٌ, though it seems that the verb is correctly
خَضَعَ, not خَضِعَ,] He had a natural stooping of
the neck: (TA:) and he bent himself, or became
bent; as also ↓ اخضع. (Zj.) And ↓ اختضع, said
of a hawk, He lowered his head to make a stoop,
or to pounce down. (Z, TA.) ―

or swiftly. (IAar, K.) ―
-b6-  خَضَعَ النَّجْمُ (tropical:)  The star,
or asterism, inclined (S, K, TA) to the place of
setting, (S, TA,) or to setting: (K, TA:) and in
like manner, خَضَعَتِ الشَّمْسُ (tropical:)  the sun inclined
&c.; like خَدَعَت: (TA:) and خَضَعَتْ أَيْدِى
الكَوَاكِبِ (tropical:)  the stars inclined to setting. (Aboo-
'Adnán, TA in art. خشع.)
-A2-  خَضَعَهُ He, or it,
rendered him still (K, TA) [and submissive:
see 1]: the verb being both intrans. and trans.
(TA.) [See also 4.] ―
-b2-  Also, (K,) inf. n. خَضْعٌ
and خُضُوعٌ, (TA,) He, or it, caused him to have
a stooping neck; as also ↓ اخضعهُ; (K;) i. e.,

says,
أَعَدَّ اللّٰهُ لِلشُّعَرَآءِ مِنِّى
صَوَاعِقَ يَخْضَعُونَ لَهُ الرِّقَابَا
[God hath prepared, for the poets, from me,
thunderbolts which make the necks to stoop to
Him]. (TA.) ―

submissive; in Persian, فَرُوتَنْ كَرْدَانِيدَنْ. (KL.
[But Golius, from the same source, explains the

commonstravit. ”]) [Hence,] أَخْضَعَتَنِى إِلَيْكَ
الحَاجَةُ (Zj, S, TA) Want, or need, [made me
lowly, humble, or submissive, to thee; or] constrained me to have recourse to thee, and to

اخضوضع: see 1, first sentence.
خَضِعٌ A plant bending by reason of softness, or
tenderness: ISd holds it to be formed after the
manner of a relative, or possessive, noun, because
there is no verb [of the measure خَضِعَ] to which
it may be referred. (TA.) [The regular form, if
it were a part. n., would be خَاضِعٌ, q. v.]
خَضْعَةٌ, or ↓ خَضَعَةٌ: see بَضَعَةٌ and بَاضِعٌ.
خَضَعَةٌ: see what next precedes.
خُضَعَةٌ A man (S) who is lowly, humble, or submissive, to everyone. (S, Sgh, K,) ―
-b2-  And One
who overcomes, or subdues, his adversaries, or
opponents, (K, TA,) and humbles and abases
them. (TA.)
خَضُوعٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.
خَاضِعٌ Lowly, humble, or submissive; (Msb;)
and ↓ خَضُوعٌ signifies the same: (S, K:) [or
rather the latter is an intensive epithet, signifying
very lowly, &c.:] the pl. of the former is خَاضِعُونَ
and خُضَّعٌ and خُضْعَانٌ, or خِضْعَانٌ: (TA:) [respecting the last two of which, see 1, second sentence:] and the pl. of ↓ خَضُوعٌ is خُضُعٌ; (S, K;)
as in the phrase قَوْمٌ خُضُعُ الرِّقَابِ [A people, or
company of men, very submissive in the necks].
(S.) It is said in the Kur [xxvi. 3], فَظَلَّتْ أَعْنَاقُهُمْ
لَهَا خَاضِعِينَ And their necks shall continue, the
pret. being used in the sense of the aor., meaning
تَدُومُ, (Jel,) submissive to it: (Jel, * TA:) the
original of the phrase is فَظَلُّوا لَهَا خَاضِعِينَ; and
اعناق is redundantly inserted to show the place of
خُضُوع, and the predicate is left in its original
state: (Bd:) or as the خضوع is only that of the
اعناق, it is allowable to make the predicate relate
to [the pronoun هم, which is] the complement of
the latter word: (Sb, Kh:) or since the خضوع
is ascribed to the necks but really belongs to the
persons, the epithet has that form of pl. which is
proper to rational beings: (Jel: [and the like is
said by Bd:]) or اعناقهم means their chiefs: or
their companies: but there is another reading
[which is literally grammatical], namely خَاضِعَةً.
(Bd.) ―
-b2-  The pl. خُضَّعٌ is also applied to Women
who have been [ or who are] soft in speech, and
still. (IAar.) [See 1.] ―
-b3-  نَعَامٌ خَوَاضِعُ [pl. of
خَاضِعَةٌ] Ostriches inclining their heads towards

manner, ظِبَآءٌ [gazelles]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  إِبِلٌ خَوَاضِعُ
(tropical:)  Camels striving, or exerting themselves, or
hastening, in their pace, or going; because, when
they do so, they lower their necks. (TA.) ―
