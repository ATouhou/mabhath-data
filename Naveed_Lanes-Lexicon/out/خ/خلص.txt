ذُو الخَلَصَةِ, (S, K,) and ذو الخُلُصَةِ, (Hishám,
K,) and ذو الخَلْصَةِ, accord. to IDrd, and some
write it ذو الخَلُصَةِ, but the first is the form commonly obtaining with the relaters of trads., (TA,)
A certain temple, (S, K,) called كَعْبَةُ اليَمَامَةِ, (S,)
or الكَعْبَةُ اليَمَانِيَّةُ, (El-Háfidh Ibn-Hajar, K,) and

and Dows and Bejeeleh and others, (TA,) in
which was an idol called الخَلَصَةُ, (S, K,) which
was demolished (S, TA) by command of Mohammad: (TA:) or ذُو الخَلَصَةِ was the idol itself,
as some say; but, says IAth, this requires consideration, because [it is asserted that] ذو is not prefixed to any but generic names: (TA: [but see
ذُو:]) or the temple was so called because it was
the place of growth of a tree of a kind called
↓ خَلَص. (K, * TA.)
خُلْصَانٌ: see خِلْصٌ, in two places.

-b2-  Also
an inf. n. of 1.

خُلَاصَةُ السَّمْنِ (S, A, L, Msb, K) and خِلَاصَتُهُ
(Fr, Sgh, K) What has become clear, of cooked
butter; (S, A, L, K;) or cooked butter into which
some dates have been thrown, or into which some
سَوِيق [i. e. meal of parched barley or wheat] has
been thrown, in order that thereby it may become
clear from the remains of the milk: (Msb:) for
when they cook fresh butter, to make it سَمْن, they
throw into it somewhat of سويق, or dates, or
globules of gazelles' dung; and when it becomes
good, and clear from the dregs, or sediment, that
سمن is called الخُلَاصَةُ, and ↓ الخِلَاصُ also, (S,
L,) mentioned by A'Obeyd, (S,) and this, namely
the خِلَاص, is the إِثْر: (S, L, K:) and the terms
↓ خُلُوصٌ (S, L, K) and قِلْدَةٌ (S, L) and قِشْدَةٌ (S,
L, K) and كُدَادَةٌ (S, L) are applied to the dregs,
or sediment, remaining at the bottom; (S, L, K;)
as also خُلَاصَةٌ: (AHeyth, L in art. قشد:) the
inf. n. is إِخْلَاصٌ; and you say, أَخْلَصْتُ السَّمْنَ: (S,
L:) or خُلَاصَةٌ and ↓ خِلَاصٌ signify dates and
سويق that are thrown into سمن; and اخلص
السَّمْنَ signifies “he threw dates and سويق into
the سمن [and so clarified it]:” and ↓ خُلَاصٌ
[thus I find it written] signifies what has become
clear, of سمن, when it is cooked: and خِلَاصٌ
also signifies, and so ↓ إِخْلَاصٌ, and ↓ أِخْلَاصَةٌ,
butter when clear from the dregs, or sediment:
and ↓ خُلُوصٌ, the dregs, or sediment, at the
bottom of the milk: (L:) ↓ إِخْلَاصٌ and ↓ إِخْلَاصَةٌ
are syn. with إِذْوَابٌ and إِذْوَابَةٌ: (TA:) or, accord.
to AZ, the latter two terms are applied to butter
when it is put into the cooking-pot to be cooked
into سمن; and when it has become good, and the
milk has become clear from the dregs, or sediment,
that milk is called إِثْرٌ and ↓ إِخْلَاضٌ: Az says, I
have heard the Arabs apply the term ↓ خِلَاصٌ to
that with which سمن is cleared, in the cookingpot, from the water and milk and dregs; for
when it is not clear, and the milk is mixed with
the butter, they take dates, or flour, or سويق,
which they throw therein, that the سمن may
become clear from the remains of the milk mixed
with it: this is the خِلَاص: but the خلاصة [i. e.
خُلَاصَة] is what remains, of the خِلَاص and dregs
or milk &c., in the bottom of the cooking-pot: (L,
TA:) [or] ↓ خِلَاصٌ (K) [accord. to some, ↓ خَلَاصٌ,
but this is app. wrong, (see Har p. 311,)] and
خُلَاصَةٌ (Hr, TA) also signify what fire has clarified, or purified, (مَا أَخْلَصَتْهُ النَّارُ,) of butter,
and of gold, and of silver: (Hr, K, TA:) or
اللَّبَنِ ↓ خِلَاصُ, means what is extracted from
milk; i. e. butter; (ADk, L, TA;) and so does
خُلَاصَةُ اللَّبَنِ: (A: [but there mentioned among
tropical expressions:]) خُلَاصَةٌ being applied in
the manner first mentioned in this paragraph, by
a secondary application is made to signify what is
clear, or pure, of other things; (Msb;) [as also
↓ خَالِصٌ: and hence both of them often signify
(assumed tropical:)  the choice, best, or most excellent, part of anything; and so, probably, does ↓ خِلَاصٌ:] and
خُلَاصَةٌ and ↓ خُلَاصٌ also signify Inspissated juice
(رُبّ) made from dates; (JK;) or this is called
↓ خُلُوصٌ. (TA.)
خَالِصٌ Clear; pure; sheer; free from admixture; unmingled; unmixed; genuine: (B,
TA:) clear, or pure, applied to any colour: (Lh,
TA:) (tropical:)  white; as also ↓ خُلَيْصٌ; [which latter
appears to me doubtful, though I know not why
Freytag has substituted for this, or for the former
word, خَلْصٌ;] both applied to anything. (K, TA.)
You say, ثَوْبٌ خَالِصٌ (tropical:)  A garment, or piece of
cloth, of a clear, or pure, white: and قَبَآءٌ أَزْرَقُ خَالِصُ
البِطَانَةِ (tropical:)  A garment of the kind called قباء blue
with a white lining. (A.) ―
-b2-  [Also (assumed tropical:)  Pure, or
sincere, love, religion, &c.] ―
-b3-  See also خُلَاصَة,
near the end of the paragraph.
خَالِصَةٌ [fem. of خَالِصٌ: used as a subst.,] (assumed tropical:)  A
pure property, or quality. (Bd in xxxviii. 46;
and K. [In the CK, خُلَّة is erroneously put for
خَلَّة: the corresponding word in Bd is خَصْلَة.])
So in the Kur [xxxviii. 46], بِخَالِصَةٍ ↓ أَخْلَصْنَاهُمْ
ذِكْرَى الدَّارِ (assumed tropical:)  We have rendered them pure by a
pure quality, (Bd, K, * TA,) the keeping in
memory the final abode: (Bd, TA:) ذكرى الدار
being a substitute for خالصة: or it may mean
[by] their keeping in memory much the final
abode and the return to God: (TA:) some also,
(TA,) namely Náfi' and Hishám, (Bd,) read
بِخَالِصَةِ, making it a prefix to ذكرى (Bd, TA)
as an explicative; or an inf. n., in the sense of
خُلُوص, prefixed to its agent. (Bd.) ―
-b2-  You say
also, هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ خَالِصَةٌ لَكَ (assumed tropical:)  This thing is a property of thine: (so in a copy of the S, and so
the phrase is written in the TA:) or is a thing
purely thine, exclusively of others: (TA:) or
هذا الشىء خَالِصَةً لَكَ this thing is particularly,
or specially, thine, or for thee. (So accord. to
other copies of the S, and a copy of the JK.)
―
-b3-  See also خِلْصٌ.
-A2-  خَالِصَةٌ is also syn. with
إِخْلَاصٌ [in some sense not pointed out: see the
latter below; and see also 4]. (TA.)
إِخْلَاصٌ [inf. n. of 4, used as a subst.]: see
خُلَاصَة, in three places.
إِخْلَاصَةٌ: see خُلَاصَة, in two places.
[
مَخْلَصٌ (tropical:)  A place of safety, or security, or
escape from an event.]
مُخْلَصٌ Chosen: (JK:) chosen by God, and
pure from pollution; applied to a man. (Zj,
TA.) [It is implied in the A and TA that it is
also syn. with مُخْلِصٌ in the sense explained
below.]
مُخْلِصٌ (tropical:)  Pure, or sincere, towards God in
religion; without hypocrisy: (TA:) or purely
believing in the unity of God. (Zj, TA.)
يَاقُوتٌ مُتَخَلِّصٌ Picked [sapphires]. (A, TA.)
