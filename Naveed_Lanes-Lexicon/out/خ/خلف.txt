خَلَفَ, aor.
خَلُفَ, inf. n. خَلْفٌ, He came after,
followed, succeeded, or remained after, another,
or another that had perished or died. (TA.)
Hence, in the Kur [vii. 168 and xix. 60], فَخَلَفَ
مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ (TA) And there hath succeeded
them, or come after them, [a posterity, or] an
evil posterity. (Bd in xix. 60.) And خَلَفَهُ He
came after him, (S, A in art. دبر, Mgh, Msb, TA,)
or behind him, (A ubi suprà, Mgh,) or following
him nearly; (A ubi suprà;) inf. n. as above,
(Mgh, TA,) and خِلْفَةٌ also: (Mgh:) or he remained after him: (K:) and ↓ جَآءَ خِلَافَهُ likewise signifies [the same as جآء خَلْفَهُ; an inf. n.
of خَالَفَ being thus used as an adv. n.; i. e.] he
came after him. (TA.) You say also, خَلَفَ اللَّيْلُ
النَّهَارَ, inf. n. خَلْفٌ and خِلْفَةٌ, The night followed,
or came after, the day. (MA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
خَلَفْتُهُ, [aor. as above,] inf. n. خَلْفٌ, [perhaps a
mistranscription for خَلَفَ,] I was, after him, a
substitute for him: (TA:) [I supplied his place:
and I superseded him.] And خَلَفَهُ, (aor. as
above, TA,) inf. n. خِلَافَةٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA)
and خَلَفٌ (TA) and خِلِّيقَى, (S, * K, * TA,) which
last is an inf. n. of the intensive kind, (Sgh,
MF, TA,) He was, or became, his خَلِيفَة [i. e.
successor, or vice-agent, &c.], (S, Mgh, Msb, K,)
or his substitute; (TA;) فِى قَوْمِهِ [among, or in
respect of, his people], (S, TA,) and أَهْلِهِ [his
family]; relating to good and to evil; wherefore
one says, أَوْصَى لَهُ بِالخِلَافَةِ [he charged him by
his will with the being his successor, or vice-agent,
&c.]; (TA;) or عَلَى أَهْلِهِ وَمَالِهِ [over his family
and his property]: (Msb:) and ↓ اختفلهُ signifies
the same; (Lh, Ibn-'Abbád, K;) he was, or
became, his خَلِيفَة (Ibn-'Abbád, TA) after
him. (Ibn-'Abbád, TA.) And خَلَفَ فُلَانًا [alone]
He was, or became, the خَلِيفَةٌ of such a one
among, or in respect of, his family (K, TA) and
his children. (TA.) And خَلَفَهُ رَبُّهُ فِى أَهْلِهِ (K,
TA) and وَلَدِهِ, (TA,) inf. n. خِلَافَةٌ, (K,) His
Lord was [for him] a خَلِيفَة [or supplier of his
place] to his family (K, TA) and his children.
(TA. [In the CK, اخلف is made to signify the
same; but this is in consequence of an omission.])
And one says, خَلَفَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ May God be to
to thee a خَلِيفَة [or supplier of the place] (S, Msb,
K) of thy father; (S, Msb,) or of the one whom thou
hast lost: (S, Msb, K:) thus one says to one who
has lost by death his father (S, Msb, K) or mother
(K) or paternal uncle (S, Msb) or any other who
cannot be replaced: (Msb, K:) and خَلَفَ اللّٰهُ
عَلَيْكَ خَيْرًا, (K,) or بِخَيْرٍ, (AZ, Msb, K,) or both,
(L,) and خَلَفَ اللّٰهُ لَكَ بِخَيْرٍ, (AZ, Msb,) and
اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ خَيْرًا ↓ أَخْلَفَ and لَكَ خَيْرًا: (K: [in
which it is implied that these phrases mean May
God supply to thee well the place of him whom
thou hast lost: but it is implied in the Msb that
the two of them there mentioned mean May God
restore to thee good in the place of that which has
gone from thee: and it appears from what here
follows that all of these phrases have the latter
meaning, whether or not they have the former
meaning also:]) to him who has lost property or
a child or a thing [of any other kind] of which
the replacement may be asked, (S,) or to him
of whom that which may be replaced has perished,
or died, (K,) one says, اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ ↓ أَخْلَفَ (S, Msb,
K) May God restore to thee the like of that which
has gone from thee, (S, Msb,) or may God restore to thee what has gone from thee; (K in a
later part of the art.;) and اللّٰه لَكَ ↓ اخلف; and
خَلَفَ اللّٰه لك : or خَلَفَ اللّٰه عَلَيْكَ is allowable in
relation to property and the like; and يَخْلَفُ,
like يَمْنَعُ is allowable as its aor., though extr.,
(K,) as it has no faucial letter to occasion the
fet-h: (TA:) and one says also, خَلَفَ اللّٰهُ لَكَ
بِخَيْرٍ meaning May God give thee good in the
place of that which has gone from thee; (TA;)
and عَلَيْكَ خَيْرًا ↓ اخلف, (Msb, TA,) meaning the
same; (TA;) and [so] لَكَ خَيْرًا ↓ اخلف and بِخَيْرٍ:
and اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ مَالَكَ ↓ اخلف and لَكَ مَالَكَ [May
God restore, or replace, to thee thy property].
(Msb.) خَلَفَ أَبَاهُ, (K,) aor.
خَلُفَ (TA,) means He
became behind his father; (K;) and if so, its
inf. n. is خَلْفٌ: (TA:) or it means he became in
the place of his father; (K;) and if so, its inf. n.
is خَلَفٌ: (TA:) and خَلَفَ مَكَانَ أَبِيهِ, inf. n.
خِلَافَةٌ (K) and خَلَفٌ, (TA,) he became in the
place of his father, exclusively of every other.
(K.) You say also, خَلَفَتِ الفَاكِهَةِ بَعْضُهَا بَعْضًا,
(JK, K,) inf. n. خَلْفٌ, (JK, TA,) or خَلَفٌ, (TA,
[the former being there altered to the latter (which
is the more probably correct), or the latter to the
former,]) and خِلْفَةٌ, (JK, TA,) The fruit replaced other fruit; or became substituted for other
fruit. (JK, * K,* TA. [In the CK, صَارَ خَلْفًا is
erroneously put for صَارَتْ خَلَفًا.]) And خَلَفَ فُلَانٌ
عَلَى فُلَانَةَ, inf. n. خِلَافَةٌ, [like عَقَبَ عَلَيْهَا,] Such
a man took as his wife such a woman after another
husband [and thus supplied his place]. (Z, TA.)
―
-b3-  خَلَفَ ُلَانًا, (aor.
خَلُفَ, TA,) He took, or seized,
such a one from behind him; (JK, * K;) as also
↓ اختلفهُ. (TA.) And hence, (TA,) خَلَفَ لَهُ
بِالسَّيْفِ (JK, TA) He came to him from behind
him, and smote his neck, or struck off his head,
with the sword. (TA.) ―
-b4-  خَلَفَ فُلَانٌ بِعَقِبِى [is
explained as meaning] Such a one stayed, or abode,
after me. (Msb in art. عقب) [But] ―
-b5-  خَلَفَ
بِعَقَبِ فُلَانٍ is said by some to mean إِلَى ↓ خَالَفَهُ
أَهْلِهِ [q. v.]: accord. to As, however, it means
He parted with such a one on the condition of
doing a certain thing, and then came behind him
[or behind his back] and did another thing after
parting with him: and Az says that this is a more
correct explanation than the former one. (TA.)
[Hence, app.,] one says also, إِنَّ امْرَأَةَ فُلَانٍ
تَخْلُفُ زَوْجَهَا بِالنِّزَاعِ إِلَى غَيْرِهِ إِذَا غَابَ عَنْهَا [Verily
the wife of such a one is unfaithful to her husband by yearning towards another when he is
absent from her: or deceives her husband behind
his back by yearning towards another; for it is
implied, by an ex. given, that اذا غاب عنها is added
by way of explanation]. (TA.) خَلَفَهُ also signifies He spoke of him, or mentioned him, [behind his back, or] when he was not present: so in
the phrase, خَلَفَهُ بِخَيْرٍ or بِشَرٍّ [He spoke of him
behind his back well or ill]. (TA.) And one says,
يَخْلُفُ النَّاسَ مِنْ وَرَائِهِمْ [meaning He defames
men behind their backs]: the action signified
hereby is like غِيبَةٌ, and may be [by making
signs] with the side of the mouth, and with the
eye, and with the head. (TA in art. همز.) ―
-b6-
خَلَفَ عَنْ أَصْحَابِهِ, (K, TA,) aor.
خَلُفَ, He remained
behind, or after, his companions; did not go forth
with them; as also أَصْحَابِهِ ↓ قَعَدَ خِلَافَ [similar
to a phrase mentioned near the beginning of this
art.]; (TA;) i. q. ↓ تخلّف; (K in explanation
of the former phrase;) which is syn. with تَأَخَّرَ;
(S, K;) as in the phrase تخلّف عَنِّى [which means
He remained behind me, or after me]; (S;)
[for] تخلّف عَنْهُ means بَقِىَ خَلْفَهُ; (Mgh;) and
[in like manner] you say, تخلّف عَنِ لاقَوْمِ He
remained behind, or after, the people, or party,
not going with them; [he held back, or hung back,
from them;] and ↓ قَعَدْتُ خِلَافَهُ [i. e. I remained]
behind him, or after him; (Msb;) and ↓ خالف
عَنَّا He remained behind us, or after us; syn.
↓ تخلّف. (TA, from a trad.) It is said in the
Kur [xvii. 78], إِلَّا قَلِيلًا ↓ وَ إِذَا لَا يَلْبَثُونَ خِلَافَكَ,
i. e. [But in that case they should not have remained] after thee [save a little while]: (JK,
TA: *) so accord. to one reading [instead of خَلْفَكَ,
which means the same]. (TA.) And in like
manner, رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ ↓ فَرِحَ المُخَلَّفُونَ بِمَقْعَدِهِمْ خِلَافَ,
in the Kur [ix. 82], means [Those who were left
behind rejoiced in their remaining] behind the
Apostle of God: (S, TA:) or the meaning here
is, مُخَالَفَةَ رسول اللّٰه [i. e. in disagreement with
the Apostle of God]: (JK, S:) thus says Lh;
but IB disagrees with him; saying that خلاف
here means بَعْدَ; and cites six exs. in which it has
this meaning, from poets. (TA.) ―
-b7-  [Hence,]
خَلَفَ فُلَانٌ عَنْ كُلِّ خَيْرٍ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one was, or
became, kept back from all good; i. e.,] did not
prosper, or was not successful. (TA. [It is there
added, that it is explained in the A as tropical,
and as meaning تَغَيَّرَ وَفَسَدَ: but this is perhaps a
mistake, occasioned by the accidental omission of
وَخَلَفَ اللَّبَنُ or the like, of which this is a correct
explanation: or the phrase thus explained in the
TA, as from the A, may correctly mean He became altered for the worse, and corrupt; agreeably
with other explanations of the verb below.]) ―
-b8-
خَلَفَ, aor.
خَلُفَ, also signifies He (a man) retired,
withdrew, or went away or apart. (JK.) And
خَلَفَتْ نَفْسَهُ عَنِ الطَّعَامِ, aor.
خَلُفَ, inf. n. خُلُوفٌ,
(assumed tropical:) His soul turned away from, avoided, or shunned,
the food, in consequence of disease. (JK, TA.)
―
-b9-  And He fled. (Ham p. 411.) ―
-b10-  And He
(a man, Sgh) ascended a mountain. (Sgh, K.)
-A2-  See also 2, first sentence.
-A3-  خَلَفَ, (S, Msb,
K, &c.,) aor. خُلُوفٌ, (Lh, Msb, TA, and Ham p. 679,)
[inf. n. خُلُوفٌ,] said of the taste of water, It was,
or became, different from, or contrary to, what
it was thought to be: and [hence,] it was, or became, altered [for the worse]: (Ham ubi suprà:)
[and] said of milk, (S, K,) and of food, (Lh, S,
Msb, K,) and the like, (Lh, TA,) and some say
خَلُفَ, (TA,) aor.
خَلُفَ, inf. n. خُلُوفٌ, (Lh, TA,) of
both verbs, (TA,) it was, or became, altered [for
the worse] (Lh, S, Msb, K) in taste, or in odour;
(S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ اخلف: or, said of milk,
the first signifies it became bad from being long
kept; or, as in the A, (tropical:)  what was good thereof
became mixed (خُلِفَ, i. e. خُلِطَ,) with other milk:
and ↓ اخلف, said of milk, signifies also it was, or
became, sour: (TA:) and the first, said of [the
beverage called] نَبِيذ, it became bad. (K.) Also,
inf. n. خُلُوفٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and خُلُوفَةٌ (K)
and خِلْفَةٌ, (L, TA,) said of the mouth (S, Mgh,
Msb, K) of a person fasting, (S, Msb, K,) It was,
or became, altered [for the worse] in odour; (S,
Mgh, Msb, K;) as also ↓ اخلف. (S, Msb, K.)
It is said in a trad. that the خُلُوف of the mouth
of one who is fasting is sweeter in the estimation
of God than the odour of musk: or, accord. to
some of the lawyers and of the relaters of traditions, خَلُوف; but [SM says,] I think this to
be a mistake, as several affirm it to be, while
others say that it is of a bad dial. : accord. to one
reading, it is خِلْفَة. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] خَلَفَ
عَنْ خُلُقِ أَبِيهِ, (K,) aor.
خَلُفَ, inf. n. خُلُوفٌ, (TA,)
(assumed tropical:) He was, or became, altered [for the worse]
from the natural disposition of his father. (K,
TA.) ―
-b3-  And خَلَفَ, (ISk, S, K,) inf. n. خَلْفٌ
[or خُلُوفٌ]; or خَلْفَ, aor.
خَلُفَ, inf. n. خَلَافَةٌ and
خُلُوفٌ; (TA;) (assumed tropical:)  He (a man) was, or became,
bad, or corrupt. (ISk, S, K, TA.) ―
-b4-  And خَلَفَ,
(K) inf. n. خَلَافَةٌ (IAth, K) and خُلُوفٌ, (K,)
(assumed tropical:) He (a man) was, or became, stupid, or foolish;
or one who had little, or no, intellect or understanding: (K, * TA:) or unprofitable: or a frequent promise-breaker: (IAth:) or خَلَفَ and
↓ اخلف, said of a slave, he was, or became, idiotic,
deficient in intellect, or bereft of his intellect.
(JK.)
-A4-  خَلَفَ, (K,) inf. n. خَلْفٌ; (S, * K, *
TA;) and ↓ اخلف, and ↓ استخلف; (S, K;) He
drew water, (S, K, TA,) لِأَهْلِهِ for his family:
[app. because he who does so leaves his family
behind him: see 2, first sentence:] (K, TA:)
[or] ↓ استخلف, said of a man, signifies اِسْتَعْذَبَ
المَآء [app. as meaning he sought, or drew, or
brought, sweet water: see art. عذب]: and,
accord. to IAar, you say, القَوْمَ ↓ أَخْلَفْتُ, meaning properly I carried sweet water to the people,
or party, when they were in the [season, or herbage, called] رَبِيع and without sweet water, or
when they were by salt water: إِخْلَافٌ [as meaning
the carrying, or drawing, of water,] being [properly] only in the ربيع: in other cases, metaphorically applied. (TA.) El-Hoteíäh says,
↓ لِزُغْبٍ كَأَوْلَادِ القَطَا رَاثَ خَلْفُهَا
عَلَى عَاجِزَاتِ النَّهْضِ حُمْرٍ حَوَاصِلُهْ
(assumed tropical:) [To, or for, downy ones, like the young ones of the
katà, whose procurer of water has been slow in
coming to those lacking the power of spreading
their wings for flight, red in their crops]: he
means ↓ مِخْلِفُهَا [or خَالِفُهَا], and has put in the
place of this the inf. n.: and by حواصله, accord.
to Ks, he means حَوَاصِلُ مَا ذَكْرْنَا [the crops of
what we have mentioned]: but Fr says that the
ه relates to the زغب, exclusively of the عاجزات,
which [latter] has the sign of the pl. ; for every
pl. that has the form of a sing. may be imagined
to be a sing., as in the saying of the poet,
مِثْلُ الفِرَاخِ نُتِفَتْ حَوَاصِلُهْ
[meaning “ like the young birds of which the
crops have been plucked ”]; for الفراخ has not
the sign of the pl., but has the form of a sing.,
like الكِتَاب and الحِجَاب: another says, [but this
is very far-fetched,] that the ه relates to النهض,
which [sometimes] means a place in the shoulderblade of the camel; and that the poet has used it
metaphorically as belonging to the قطا. (S.)
-A5-
خَلَفَ الثَّوْبَ, (S,) or القَمِيصَ, aor.
خَلُفَ, (Msb, K,)
inf. n. خَلْفٌ (Kr, TA) and خُلْفَةٌ, in some copies
of the K خَلْفَةٌ, [so in my MS. copy of the K,
and so in the TK,] and [in some] خُلَفٌ also, but
these require consideration, (TA,) He took out
from the garment, or shirt, the part that was
worn out, (S, Msb, K,) that is, the middle part,
which was worn out, (S, Msb,) and then sewed
the [cut] edges together. (S, Msb, K.) And
الثَّوْبَ ↓ اخلف signifies the same as خَلَفَهُ, i. e.
He repaired the garment [app. in any manner,
or, as is implied in the S and TA, by substituting
one piece for another]. (S, K, TA.) ―
-b2-  The saying, in a trad. of Hamneh, فَإِذَا خَلَفَتْ ذٰلِكَ فَلْتَغْتَسِلْ,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  And when she has discriminated that
period of days and nights during which she has
been حَائِض, [she shall perform a complete ablution
of herself,] is from خَلَفَ القَمِيص signifying as
explained above. (Msb.)
-A6-  خَلَفَ signifies also
He mixed [a thing with another thing; as, for
instance, (see خُلِفَ in a passage above,) milk
with other milk]: and he mixed saffron, and
medicine, with water. (TA.)
-A7-  خَلَفَ بَيْتَهُ He
put to, or made for, his tent, a pole, (K, TA,)
termed a خَالِفَة, (TA,) in the hinder part thereof.
(K TA.)
-A8-  خَلِفَ, aor.
خَلَفَ, (K,) inf. n. خَلَفٌ,
(S, K,) He (a camel) inclined towards one side.
(S, K.) ―
-b2-  خَلَفٌ is also an inf. n. (of خَلِفَ, said
of a man, TK) signifying The being أَخْلَف as
meaning contrarious, hard in disposition, as
though going with a leaning towards one side:
―
-b3-  and the being left-handed: ―
-b4-  and the being
أَحْوَل [or squint-eyed]. (K.)
-A9-  خَلِفَتْ, aor.
خَلَفَ,
(Msb, K,) inf. n. خَلَفٌ, (Msb, TA,) She (a
camel) was, or became, pregnant. (Msb, K.)
2
خلّفهُ, (Msb,) and خلّفهُ وَرَآءَهُ, (S, TA,)
inf. n. تَخْلِيفٌ, (TA,) He left him behind him;
(Msb;) namely, a man: (S, Msb, TA:) and
↓ خَلَفَهُ [signifies the same: or] he made him to be
behind him; as also ↓ اخلفهُ [q.v.], and ↓ اختلفهُ:
(TA:) [whence the saying,] أَلْحَحْتُ عَلَى فُلَانٍ
↓ فِى الاِتِبَاعِ حَتَّى اخْتَلَفْتُهُ i. e. [I pressed upon
such a one in following] until I made him to be
behind me. (ISk, TA.) You say also, خَلَّفَهُمْ,
inf. n. as above, meaning He was, or became, or
went, before them; and left them behind him.
(TA.) And خلّفوا أَثْقالَهُم, inf. n. as above, They
left their loads, or baggage &c., behind their
backs; (O, K;) when they went away to draw
water. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] خلّفهُ He made him,
or appointed him, his خَلِيفَة [i. e. successor, or
vice-agent, &c.]; (K;) and so ↓ استخلفهُ. (S,
Msb, K.) So in the Kur [xxiv. 54], ↓ لَيَسْتَخِلَفَنَّهُمْ
فِى الْأَرْضِ كَمَا اسْتَخْلَفَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ [That
He will assuredly make them to be successors in
the earth, like as He made to be successors those
who were before them]. (TA.)
-A2-  خلّف بِنَاقَتِهِ,
(S, K,) inf. n. as above, (S,) He bound one of the
teats of his she-camel with the thing termed صِرَار
[in order that her young one might not suck it]:
(S, K:) from Yaakoob. (S.)
3
خالفهُ, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) inf. n. خِلَافٌ (S,
Mgh, Msb, K, TA) and مُخَالَفَةٌ, (S, Msb, K, TA,)
He [or it] disagreed with, or differed from, him
[or it]; or he dissented from him; (Mgh, Msb;)
contr. of وَافَقَهُ; فِى كَذَا [in, or in respect of,
such a thing]: (Mgh:) and he, or it, was contrary, opposed, or repugnant, to him, or it:
(TA:) [and he acted contrarily, contrariously,
adversely, or in opposition, to him, or it; he, or
it, contravened, or opposed, him, or it:] and he
[or it] contradicted him [or it]. (M in art. نقض.)
It is said in a prov., إِنَّمَا أَنْتَ خِلَافَ الضَّبُعِ الرَّاكِبَ,
i. e. تُخَالِفُ خِلَافَ الضَّبُعِ [Verily thou art one who
acts with the contrariousness of the hyena towards
the rider]: for the hyena [attacks a man on foot,
but], when it sees the rider, flees from him.
(IAar, TA.) You say also, خَالَفَنِى عَنْ كَذَا
He turned away from such a thing [in opposition
to me, or] when I betook myself to it: [see also
the last sentence but one of the first paragraph of
art. بهت:] and خالفنى إِلَى كَذَا He betook himself to such a thing [in opposition to me, or] when
I turned away from it: (Mgh:) or خالفهُ إِلَى
الشَّىْءِ means he disobeyed him by betaking himself to the thing; or betook himself to the thing
after he had forbidden him it. (TA.) And hence,
(Mgh,) هُوَ يُخَالِفُ إِلَى امْرَأَةِ فُلَانٍ, (S, Mgh, *) or
إِلَى فُلَانَةَ, (O, L, TA,) in the K erroneously,
هو يخالف فُلَانَةَ, (TA,) He comes to the wife of
such a one when he [the latter] is absent from her,
(S,) or to such a woman when her husband is
absent from her: (Mgh, * O, L, K, TA:) and
خالفهُ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ [he came to his (another's) wife in
his (the husband's) absence]: see 1, in the former
half of the paragraph. (Az, TA.) And خالفهُ
إِلَيْهِمْ He watched to see him, and, when he was
absent from them, namely, his family, he went in
to them: (Jm, O, TA:) and, accord. to AZ,
فُلَانٌ صَاحِبَهُ ↓ اخلف Such a one watched to see his
companion, and, when he was absent, he came,
and went in to him [or rather to his wife or to his
family]: (TA:) [or] صَاحِبَهُ ↓ خالف he watched
to see his companion, and, when he was absent,
went in to his wife: (K, and the like is said in
the JK:) thus says IDrd, on the authority of
AZ. (TA.) And خالف إِلَى قَوْمٍ He came to a
party, or company of men, from behind them [or
behind their backs]: or he feigned to them the
contrary of that which he conceived in his mind,
and took them unawares. (TA.) Aboo-Dhu-eyb
says, [describing a collector of wild honey,]
إِذَا لَسَعَتْهُ النَّحْلُ لَمْ يَرْجُ لَسْعَهَا
وَخَالَفَهَا فِى بَيْتِ نُوبٍ عَوَاسِلِ
(S in the present art., in which only the former
hemistich is cited, and in art. رجو,) i. e. [When
the bees sting him,] he fears not nor minds [their
stinging], (S in art. رجو) [but comes, during their
absence, to the hiving-place of bees occupied in
gathering honey:] meaning, he comes to their
honey, (S, TA, [in the latter of which, in the
place of النحل, is put الدَّبْرُ “ the swarm of bees,”])
and takes it, (TA,) while they are feeding; (S,
TA;) or, as AA says, he comes behind them to
the honey while they are absent: AO explains it
by خَالَفَهَا إِلَى مَوْضِعٍ آخَرَ which [he says] means
he keeps with them [to another place]; syn.
لَازَمَهَا; [and thus this phrase (which is strangely
misinterpreted in the TK and in Freytag's Lexicon) is explained in the K, but without any
reference to the verse;] as also حَالَفَهَا, with the
unpointed ح: (TA:) and some read the verse
thus; but this reading is said to be a mistake.
(TA in art. حلف.) ―
-b2-  جَآءَ خِلَافَهُ: see 1, near the
beginning of the paragraph. And see also five
other exs. in the middle portion of the same paragraph. ―
-b3-  خالف بَيْنَ رِجْلَيْهِ He put one of his
legs forward and the other backward: and [hence,]
المُخَالَفَةُ بَيْنَ الرِّجْلَيْنِ [as signifying the alternate
shifting of the legs to and fro] is metonymically
used as meaning the act of dancing. (Har p. 108.)
[And خالف بَيْنَ الشَّيْئَيْنِ He put, or placed, the
two things contrariwise; or on contrary sides; or
in contrary directions. Hence,] أَوْ تُقَطَّعَ أَيْدِيهِمْ
وَأَرْجُلُهُمْ مِنْ خِلَافٍ, in the Kur v. 37, [Or that
their hands and their feet shall be cut off on contrary sides,] means that their right hands and
left feet shall be cut off. (Bd, Jel. [See also
similar exs. in the Kur vii. 121 and xx. 74 and
xxvi. 49.]) [Hence also,] فَرَسٌ بِهِ شِكَالٌ مِنْ خِلَافٍ,
(JK,) or ذُو خَدَمَتَانِ مِنْ خِلَافٍ, (TA,) A horse
having a whiteness in his right fore leg and his
left hind leg [or the reverse]: (JK, TA:) and
some say, لَهُ خَدَمَتَانِ مِنْ خِلَافٍ when he has a
whiteness [or rather a ring of white a little above
the hoof] in his fore leg [or right fore leg] and
another in his left fore leg [probably a mistake of
a copyist for his left hind leg]. (TA.)

اخلفهُ: see 2, first sentence. Also He put
him, turned him, or made him to go back or
stand back, behind him. (K, TA.) And اخلف

or simply اخلف [used elliptically], (S, K,) He
put [back] his hand to his sword, (Fr, S, K, TA,)
in order to draw it, (JK, S, K, TA,) it being
hung behind him. (Fr, * TA.) And اخلف السَّيْفَ
[He hung the sword behind him; or kept it hung
behind him]: said, in a trad., of a man on the
day of Bedr. (TA.) And اخلف عَنِ البَعِيرِ [for
اخلف عَنْهُ الحَقَبَ] He shifted [backwards] the
hind girth of the camel, putting it next to his
testicles, on account of its hurting the sheath of
his penis, and causing a suppression of his urine;
(As, S, K;) as also اخلف البَعِيرَ: (TA:) or you
say only, أَخْلِفِ الحَقَبَ, meaning remove thou
the hind girth from the sheath of the penis. (Lh,
TA.) And اخلف الدَّابَّةَ بِالسَّوْطِ He struck the
beast on the hinder part with the whip. (JK.)
―
-b2-  اخلف البَازِلَ [He (a camel) exceeded in age
the بازل, which is generally one that has entered
his ninth year: as though he made the بازل to be
behind him: and so, app., اخلف alone; البَازِلَ
being understood: see مُخْلِفٌ]. El-Jaadee says,
أَخْلَفَ البَازِلَ عَامًا أَوْ بَزَلْ  أَيِّدِ الكَاهِلِ جَلْدٍ بَازِلٍ
[Strong in the withers, hardy, a بازل; that has
exceeded in age him who has just become a بازل
by a year, or that has himself just become a
بازل]. (S, TA.) Some say that الإِخْلَافُ is [a
term denoting] the last of the ages [that have
words to signify them] with respect to all beasts.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  اخلف فُلَانٌ صَاحِبَهُ: see 3, near the
middle of the paragraph. ―
-b4-  اخلفهُ مَا وَعَدَهُ, (S,)
or مَوْعِدَهُ, (Mgh,) or وَعْدَهُ, (Msb,) or الوَعْدَ, (K,)
inf. n. إِخْلَافٌ, (Mgh,) He broke, (Mgh,) or
failed to perform, (S, K,) his promise, or the
promise, to him: (S, Mgh, K:) restricted to
future time: (Msb:) الإِخْلَافُ is, in respect of
the future, like الكَذِبُ in respect of the past:
(S, K:) or the making a promise and not fulfilling it: (Lh, K:) and some say that it signifies one's seeking an object of want, or water,
and not finding it. (TA.) It is said in a trad.,
إِذَا وَعَدَ أَخْلَفَ, i. e. When he promises, he does
not fulfil his promise, and is not true [to it].
(TA.) [Hence,] أَخْلَفَتِ النُّجُومُ, i. e. (tropical:)  [The
stars broke their promise; meaning,] were attended with drought, not attended with rain: (S,
K, TA:) a saying of the people in the Time of
Ignorance: (S, TA:) and so عَنْ أَنْوَائِهَا ↓ اِخْتَلَفَتْ:
for they used to believe and say that they were
rained upon by such and such a نَوْء. (TA. [See
نَوْءٌ.]) Hence also, أَخْلَفَتِ الحُمَّى (assumed tropical:)  The fever,
being tertian or quartan, came not in its time, or
turn. (Mgh.) And أَخْلَفَتْ said of a she-camel,

bore no fruit: or lost the fruit that it had. (L,
TA. [The verb, said of trees, has also another
meaning, which see below.]) ―
-b5-  اخلفهُ is also
said, by El-Fárábee, to occur as meaning He acted
according to his promise [or fulfilled his promise]
to him; thus bearing two contr. significations: but
this is strange. (MF.) ―
-b6-  Also He found him to be
a breaker of his promise; (JK;) or he found his
promise to be broken, or unfulfilled. (S, K.) ―
-b7-
اخلف عَلَيْكَ and لَكَ, each with an objective complement (خَيْرًا or مَالَكَ) expressed or understood:
see 1, in six places, in the former half of the paragraph. You say also, اخلف فُلَانٌ لِنَفْسِهِ, (S, K,)
or لِغَيْرِهِ, (TA,) Such a one replaced to himself,
(S, K,) or to another, (TA,) a thing that had
gone from him, with another thing. (S, K.)
Ibn-Mukbil says,
فَأَخْلِفْ وَأَتْلِفْ إِنَّمَا المَالُ عَارَةٌ
وَكُلْهُ مَعَ الدَّهْرِ الَّذِى هُوَ آكِلُهْ
[Then replace thou, and consume: wealth is but
a loan: and devour it with time, which is a
devourer thereof]: he means, gain a substitute
for what thou hast consumed. (S, TA.) And
the Arabs say to him who has put on a new
garment, أَبْلِ وَأَخْلِفْ وَاحْمَدِ الكَاسِى [Wear out
thy garment, and replace it with another, and
praise the Clother, meaning God]. (TA.) And
أَبْلِ وَيُخْلِفُ اللّٰهُ [Wear out thy garment, and
God will replace it with another; or, may God
replace &c.]. (S in art. بلو) ―
-b8-  See also اخلف
الثَّوْبَ near the end of the first paragraph. ―
-b9-
اخلف said of a plant, or of herbage, It put forth
the خِلْفَة, (S, Msb, K,) meaning leaves that come
forth after the first leaves, in the [season called]
صَيْف; (TA;) and in like manner said of trees:
(Msb, TA:) or اخلف الشَّجَرُ means the trees put
forth fruit after other fruit. (JK.) And, said
of fruit, It came forth, some thereof after other
thereof. (TA.) And اخلفت الأَرْضُ The land
became affected by the cold of the latter part of
the [season called] صَيْف, and some of its trees
consequently become green. (TA.) ―
-b10-  Also, said
of a bird, (tropical:)  It put forth feathers after the first
feathers: (K, TA:) from the same verb said of
a plant, or of herbage. (TA.) ―

boy, (assumed tropical:)  He nearly attained to puberty. (JK, Az.
K, TA.) ―
-b12-  And, said of a solid-hoofed beast,

(JK.)
-A2-  اخلفهُ said of medicine, It weakened
him (K, TA) by causing him to go frequently to

اِخْتِلَافٌ signifies The following reciprocally;
or alternating. (Mgh.) So in the phrase in the
Kur [ii. 159 and iii. 187 and xlv. 4], وَاخْتِلَافِ
اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارِ And the alternating of the night and
the day. (Mgh) [And in a verse of El-'Ajjáj
cited voce أَبْلَى, in art. بلو.] And hence the
phrase, اِخْتَلَفَا ضَرْبَةً Each of them beat, or struck
the other in turn. (Mgh.) And the saying, in a
trad. of 'Alee, فَاخْتَلَفَتْ بَيْنَ عُبَيْدَةَ بْنِ الحٰرِثِ
وَالوَلِيدِ بْنِ عُقْبَةَ ضَرْبَتَانِ [And two blows were interchanged between 'Obeydeh Ibn-El-Hárith and

وَيدُ رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ فِى إِنَآءٍ وَاحِدٍ, meaning My hand
and the hand of the Apostle of God were both
put [by turns] into one vessel. (Mgh.) And
اِخْتَلَفُوا signifies They followed, or succeeded, one

after him. (TA in art. عور.) ―
-b2-  Also The going,
or moving, repeatedly, to and fro; so coming and
going; or reciprocating; syn. تَرَدُّدٌ [in this sense,
as is shown in this art. in the K and TA, and in
the S and K in art. رود &c.: and also as mean
ing the returning, or repairing, time after time,
or repeatedly, or frequently, to a person or place;
because it implies coming and going: and sometimes it means simply the returning; because this
cannot be without a previous going]. (K.) You say,
هُوَ يَخْتَلِفُ إِلَى فُلَانٍ, i. e. يَتَرَدَّدُ [He returns, or
repairs, time after time, repeatedly, or frequently,
to such a one]: and اِخْتَلَفَ إِلَيْهِ اخْتِلَافَةً وَاحِدَةً
[He returned to him once]. (TA.) And هُوَ

looseness of the bowels, or a diarrhœa]. (K.)
And [perhaps as implying coming and going,]
اختلف also signifies He supplied, or gave, or
offered, water. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Also The disagreeing,
differing, or varying, in state or condition or
quality &c.; being dissimilar, different, diverse,
various, incongruous, discordant, or dissentient:]
اختلف is the contr. of اِتَّفَقَ; (K, TA;) and is
said of anything that is dissimilar [in the parts or
members &c. of which it is composed]; as also
↓ تخالف. (TA.) You say, الأَمْرَانِ ↓ تخالف [and
اختلف الامران], i. e. لَمْ يَتَّفِقَا [The two things,
or affairs, or cases, were, or became, dissimilar,
&c.]. (TA.) And اختلفوا and ↓ تخالفوا (Mgh,
Msb) [They disagreed, &c., فِى أَمْرٍ in a thing or
an affair or a case;] every one of them took to,
or held, a way, or an opinion, different from, or
contrary to, that of another: (Msb:) both signify the same. (Mgh.) It is said in a trad.,
سَوُّوا صُفُوفَكُمْ وَلَا تَخْتَلِفُوا فَتَخْتَلِفَ قُلُوبُكُمْ [Make
ye your ranks even when ye place yourselves to
pray together, and be not dissimilar in your
positions, for in that case your hearts would disagree]; meaning, when one of you advances, or
stands, before another in the ranks, your hearts
will be affected, and disagreement in respect of
friendship and amity will arise among you: or,
as some say, it means, your hearts will be made
to recoil: or the صُورَة [or specific character] of
your hearts will become changed into another
صورة. (TA.) [Hence,] اِخْتَلَفَتْ عَنْ أَنْوَائِهَا, said

خَلْفٌ [meaning The location, or quarter, that
is behind; and the time past;] (K; [so in my
MS. copy, and thus it should be written as a
simple noun; but in the CK خَلْفُ;]) or الخَلْفُ;
(Lth, K;) contr. of قُدَّامٌ [or القُدَّامُ]: (Lth, K:)
[and] خَلْفَ [Behind; and after;] contr. of
قُدَّامَ: (S: [thus in my tow copies; and said in
the margin of one of them to be thus in the copy
of IB, and in that of El-Jawáleekee:]) a simple
noun: and an adv. n.: of the fem. gender [as
meaning the جِهَة; but otherwise it seems to be
masc.]. (TA.) You say, جَآءَ خَلْفَهُ [and مِنْ
خَلْفِهِ, both meaning He came behind him, and
after him]. (Mgh.) And جَلَسْتُ خَلْفَ فُلَانٍ I
sat after, or behind, such a one; syn. بَعْدَهُ (S.)
And لَبِثَ خَلْفَهُ He remained after him. (K.)
Some read, in the Kur [xvii. 78], وَإِذًا لَايَلْبَثُونَ
خَلْفَكَ: others read خِلَافَكَ [which means the
same, as mentioned above: see the middle of the
first paragraph of this art.]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  خَلْفٌ signifies also The back (K, TA) itself: so says IAar:
and particularly, of a house; the side corresponding
to, or over against, that in which is the door;
and as a house may have two doors, [in two different sides,] it may be said to have two backs,
each of which may be thus termed; and the dual
of this word seems to be used as meaning two
backs in a trad. [respecting the building of the
Kaabeh]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And One who comes after
another; (S, TA;) as also ↓ خَلَفٌ, or, accord. to
some, there is a difference between these two, as
will be shown in what follows; (S;) and ↓ خَالِفٌ
and ↓ خَالِفَةٌ: it is originally an inf. n.: (TA:)
and signifies one who remains after another,
whether this other be dead or living: and one
remaining after another who is dead; his follower, or successor; the follower, or successor, of
one who has gone: used in praise and in dispraise:
pl. خُلُوفٌ: and the sing. also signifies [like the
pl.] persons remaining after others; accord. to
some: (IB, TA:) a remnant of people: (Lh,
TA:) and a generation after a generation; (Lth,
S, K;) as also ↓ خَلَفٌ: (Lth, TA:) but Lth says
that the former is applied to the evil, and ↓ the
latter to the good, (K, TA,) whether meaning a
generation or a son: (TA:) the latter means
a good son (K, TA) remaining after his father:
(TA:) and the former, a bad son: (K, TA:)
[therefore] one says, هُوَ خَلْفُ سَوْءٍ مِنْ أَبِيهِ [He is
a bad son] who has taken the place of his father,
and صِدْقٍ من ابيه ↓ خَلَفُ [a good son] &c.: (S:)
but sometimes each is used in the place of the
other; so that one says, هو خَلْفُ صِدْقٍ من ابيه:
(K:) or both signify the same: (S, K:) so says
Akh: some, he says, use the former; and some,
the latter: but some say صِدْقٍ ↓ خَلَفُ and خَلْفُ
سَوْءٍ, meaning thus to distinguish between them:
(S:) accord. to IB, ↓ خَلَفٌ correctly signifies a
man's successor who is a substitute for him, good
and bad: and is originally an inf. n.: (TA:) and
the pl. of this is أَخْلَافٌ: (AZ, IB, TA:) accord.
to IAth, خَلَفُ صِدْقٍ means a good generation:
and خَلْفُ سَوْءٍ, an evil generation: (TA:) and
خَلْفٌ likewise signifies progeny [without restriction]. (K.) One says also, (S, K,) of a
people following people more in number than
they, (S,) هٰؤُلَآءِ خَلْفُ سَوْءٍ [These are a bad generation. (S, K.) And بَقِينَا فِى خَلْفِ سَوْءٍ We
remained among an evil remnant. (Lh, TA.)
And فَخَلَفَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ, in the Kur [vii. 168
and xix. 60], is explained as meaning And there
remained after them a remnant. (TA.) ―
-b4-
[Hence,] (tropical:)  One in whom is no good. (IB, K.)
[And app. also Persons in whom is no good..] ―
-b5-
And (tropical:)  A thing in which is no good: (IB, TA:)
[and particularly] (assumed tropical:)  a bad saying; (ISk, S, Msb,
K;) a wrong, bad saying, like the خَلْف of mankind. (A 'Obeyd, Msb.) See also خُلْفٌ. It is
said in a prov., سَكَتَ أَلْفًا وَنَطَقَ خَلْفًا (assumed tropical:)  He held his
tongue from a thousand words (سَكَتَ عَنْ أَلْفِ
كَلِمَة), and then uttered what was wrong. (ISk,
S, Msb.) An Arab of the desert, who had been
guilty of a breach of manners (حَبَقَ حَبْقَةً), pointed
with his thumb towards his اِسْت, and said, إِنَّهَا
خَلْفٌ نَطَقَتْ خَلْفًا [which may be rendered,
Verily it is a thing in which is no good: it uttered a thing in which was no good: but it
obviously admits of being rendered otherwise].
(IAar, S.) ―
-b6-  Also People who have gone away
from the tribe (T, K) to draw water, and have
left their baggage &c. behind them: (T, TA:)
and such as are present, [remaining behind,] of
the tribe: thus bearing two contr. significations:
pl. خُلُوفٌ. (K.) You say حَىٌّ خُلُوفٌ A tribe
who are absent; none of them remaining behind:
(S, TA:) or a tribe of which the men are absent
and the women remaining: (TA:) and خُلُوفٌ
also signifies the contr., i. e. such as are present,
(S, TA,) remaining behind. (S.) It is said of
Mohammad, in a trad., لَمْ يَتْرُكْ أَهْلَهُ خُلُوفًا, i. e.
He did not leave his family neglected, with no
pastor nor protector. (TA.) See also a verse of
El-Hoteíäh in the latter part of the first paragraph
of this article.

وَطْب [or skin for milk, or for clarified butter and
milk: as though it were a remnant thereof].

as has one head: and the edge of a فأس: or the
head thereof: (K:) you say فَأْسٌ ذَاتُ خَلْقَيْنِ a
two-headed فأس: (S, TA:) or ذَاتُ خَلْقَيْنِ and
↓ ذَاتُ خِلْقَيْنِ are names of the فأس (K, TA)
when two-headed: (TA:) and the pl. is ذَوَاتُ
الخَلْقَيْنِ: (K:) pl. خُلُوفٌ. (JK.) ―
-b2-  And The
head of a razor. (K.) ―
-b3-  And The [pointed]
head of a مِنْقَار, [an iron instrument like the فَأْس,

are pecked, or wrought into shape, (see مِنْقَارٌ,)
and] with which wood is cut. (TA.)
-A5-  See also
خِلْفٌ.
خُلْفٌ a subst. from إِخْلَافٌ, (S, Msb, K,) relating to a promise, and restricted to future time;
(Msb;) i. e. a subst. used in the place of إِخْلَافٌ;
(Lh, TA;) meaning The breach, or non-fulfilment, of a promise; as also ↓ خُلُفٌ, which is said
to be the original form of the word, and ↓ خُلُوفٌ:
(TA:) it is, in respect of the future, like كَذِبٌ
in respect of the past: (S, K:) some say that it
signifies a false, or wrong, saying; which is a
meaning of ↓ خَلْفٌ, with fet-h, before mentioned:
but perhaps these two words may be syn. dial.
vars. (MF, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, (Msb,) or ↓ خُلْفَةٌ, and
↓ خِلْفَةٌ, (K, TA,) Disagreement, difference, dissension, contrariety, contrariousness, or opposition, (Msb, K, * TA,) in opinions or the like,

or the extremity of the udder of the she-camel:
(Msb, K:) or the hinder of the أَطْبَآء [or teats]:
(K:) or the udder itself; (Lth, TA;) [i. e.] it is,
to the she-camel, (Msb, * K,) like the ثَدْى to the
human being, (Msb,) or like the ضَرْع to the ewe

or put, or done, instead of, in place of, or in exchange for, another thing. (A 'Obeyd, Th, S,
Msb, K, TA.) You say, اِجْعَلْ هٰذَا خَلْفًا مِنْ هٰذَا
Make thou this to be a substitute for this. (Msb.)
And هٰذَا خَلَفٌ مِمَّا أُخِذَ لَكَ This is a substitute
for what has been taken to thee. (IB.) And
فِى هٰؤُلَآءِ القَوْمِ خَلَفٌ مِمَّنْ مَضَى In these people
are such as supply the place of those who have
gone. (TA.) And فِى فُلَانٍ خَلَفٌ مِنْ فُلَانٍ [In
such a one is a substitute for such a one]. (TA.)
And هُوَ مِنْ أَبِيهِ خَلَفٌ He is a substitute for his
father. (IB.) See also خَلْفٌ, in six places, in
the former half of the paragraph.

Pregnant: n. un. with ة: (S, K:) accord. to
some, (TA,) the pl. of خَلِفَةٌ, which signifies a
pregnant camel, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) or, as some
say, one that has completed a year after bringing
forth and has then been covered and has conceived,
until she enters upon the term called التَّعْشِير,
(TA, [from-the time when her pregnancy has
become manifest, (see قَارِحٌ and لَاقِحٌ,)] is مَخَاضٌ,
(Mgh, Msb, TA,) like as the pl. of اِمْرَأَةٌ is نِسَآءٌ;
(Msb, TA;) and sometimes خَلِفَاتٌ (Mgh, Msb,
TA) and خِلَافٌ: (TA:) but خَلِفٌ occurs in the
saying of the rájiz,
مَا لَكَ تَرْغِينَ وَلَا تَرْغُوا الخَلِفْ
[What aileth thee that thou utterest a grumbling
cry, when the pregnant camels utter not that
cry?]. (IB.)
خُلَفٌ: see خُلْفَةٌ.
خُلُفٌ: see خُلْفٌ.
خَلْفَةٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.
خُلْفَةٌ: see خُلْفٌ. ―

an imperfection: (K:) and badness, corruptness,
vitiousness, or dishonesty: (TA:) and foolishness,
or stupidity; or paucity, or want, of intellect or
understanding; as also ↓ خَلَافَةٌ [properly an inf. n.,
of خَلُفَ, and before mentioned as such; (see 1,
in the latter half of the paragraph;)] and idiocy.
(K.) All of these meanings have been assigned
to it in explanations of the saying, أَبِيعُكَ هٰذَا العَبْدَ
وَأَبْرَأُ إِلَيْكَ مِنْ خُلْفَتِهِ [I sell to thee this slave, but
I am irresponsible to thee for his vice, &c.]: or,
accord. to IAar, the meaning is, خِلَافِهِ [his contrariousness]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also The last taste of
food; (K;) as in the saying, إِنَّهُ لَطَيِّبُ الخُلْفَةِ
[Verily it is good, or sweet, in respect of the last
taste]; (TA;) and so ↓ خَلْفَةٌ: pl. خُلَفٌ: and it
(خُلْفَةٌ) signifies also loss of appetite for food, in
consequence of disease: (so accord. to the CK:)
[or,] accord. to some copies of the K, ↓ خَلْفَةٌ has
this latter signification; and so ↓ خُلَفٌ: accord.
to other copies, خُلَفٌ is pl of خَلْفَةٌ in this sense:
but both these readings require consideration:
what is found in the Lexicons is, خَلَفَتْ نَفْسُهُ
عَنِ الطَّعَامِ, aor.
خَلُفَ, inf. n. خُلُوفٌ; meaning as
explained above, in the latter half of the first
paragraph. (TA.)

خِلْفَةً, (S, K, *) meaning ذَوَى خِلْفَةٍ, (Bd,) i. e.
[And He it is who hath made the night and the
day] so that each replaces the other: or each follows the other: (K, * TA:) or so that he who is
unable to accomplish a thing in the night may do
it in the day, and the reverse. (Fr, L, K.) Zuheyr says, of wild animals, يَمْشِينَ خِلْفَةً, meaning
They go to and fro. (S, TA. [See Em p. 109.])
And one says, أَخَذَتْهُ خِلْفَةٌ, meaning He was
taken with [an affection causing] a frequent going
to and from the privy. (S, K.) [And hence,]
خِلْفَةٌ signifies also, A discharging of the bowels;
or a purging and vomiting together; (K;) or a
disordered state of the stomach arising from [unwholesome] food; (TA;) a looseness, or diarrhœa.

after the people have gone away. (L, K.) ―
-b6-
And A man's watching to see another, (أَنْ يُنَاظِرَ

paragraph,] TA,) and when he is absent from his

AZ cites, as an ex., the saying [of a rájiz],
سَاقِيَاهُمَا ↓ دَلْوَاىْ خِلْفَانِ
[My two buckets are different, and their two
suppliers with water]; (S, TA;) meaning that one
of them [i. e. of the buckets] is ascending and full,

(TA, in two places.) And one says of two children,

senses (TA) is أَخْلَافٌ and خِلَفَةٌ; (K, * TA;) the

TA) incorrectly pronounced with teshdeed (O,
Msb, K, TA) and fet-h [to the خ, i. e. خَلَّافٌ],
(TA,) A well-known kind of tree; (S;) the
[kind of tree called] صَفْصَاف: (Msb:) or a
species of the صفصاف, but not the صفصاف itself:
(K:) [the salix Aegyptia of Linnæus; called by
this name in the present day; and by some, improperly, بَانٌ, q. v.:] it abounds in the land of
the Arabs; and is [also] called سَوْجَرٌ [or سَوْحَرٌ];
and there are many varieties thereof; all of them
soft and weak; (TA;) but it is seldom, or never,
found in the desert: (Msb:) they assert that it
is thus called because the torrent brings it from
one locality to another, so that it grows in a place
different from that of its origin; (AHn, Msb, K, *
TA;) but this is not a valid assertion: (TA:)
[it is a coll. gen. n.:] n. un. with ة. (Msb, TA.)
سُوِّينَ مِنْ خِلَافِ, in the saying of the rájiz cited
voce خُفٌّ, means Made of different trees: it does
not mean of the tree called خِلَاف; because this
is seldom, or never, found in the desert. (S,
TA.) ―
-b2-  Also The sleeve of a shirt. (IAar, K.)
خُلُوفٌ: see خُلْفٌ.
-A2-  It is also, as stated
above, pl. of خَلْفٌ: (IB, K, TA:) ―
-b2-  and a pl.
of خِلْفٌ. (TA.)
خَلِيفٌ: see خَلِيفَةٌ, in three places. ―
-b2-  Also
One who holds back from the place, or time, of
promise: and one who breaks a promise. (TA.)
―
-b3-  And A woman that has let down her hair
behind her. (JK, O, K.) ―
-b4-  And A woman that
has attained to the period of one day, or two
days, after her having brought forth. (IAar.)
[Perhaps from the signification next following.]
―
-b5-  A she-camel in the second day after her
having brought forth: pl. خُلُفٌ and خُلْفٌ: (K,
TA:) these two pls. are mentioned in the K in
different places in this art., but both are correct,
like رُسُلٌ and رُسْلٌ. (TA.) Hence, (TA,) one
says, رَكِبَهَا يَوْمَ خَلِيفِهَا [He rode her on the second
day after she had brought forth]. (K.) ―
-b6-  And
The milk that is after the biestings: (AA, K:)

لِبَئِهَا He drew from her the milk that came after
the biestings had passed away. (JK.) And اِيتِنَا
بِلَبَنِ نَاقَتِكَ يَوْمَ خَلِيفِهَا, i. e. [Bring thou to us

cessation of her biestings; i. e., of the milking
that is after her bringing forth by a day or two
days. (AA, TA.)
-A2-  Applied to a garment, (S,
K,) or a shirt, (Msb,) Having the middle, wornout part taken out, and the [cut] edges then sewed
together: (S, Msb, K *:) and ↓ مَخْلُوفٌ signifies
the same; (JK;) or a garment composed of two
pieces sewed together: or, as some say, this signifies a garment pledged. (TA.)
-A3-  Also, accord.
to A 'Obeyd, The part beneath the armpit: and
the خَلِيفَانِ of the camel are like the إِبْطَانِ of
man: accord. to the S and the O, خَلِيفَا النَّاقَةِ
signifies the two armpits of the she-camel (إِبْطَاهَا):
but the author of the K, following the [first] explanation given by A 'Obeyd, says that this is
wrong, and that the meaning is the parts beneath
the two armpits of the she-camel. (TA.)
-A4-  And
A gap between two mountains, (JK,) or between
two mountain-tops, (TA,) of little breadth and
length: (JK, TA:) or a road between two mountains: (S, K:) or a valley between two mountains: (K:) or a place where water pours forth
(K, TA) between two mountains, or between two
valleys, passing thence into a wide tract: (TA:)
and any road in a mountain, (Skr, K,) or behind
a mountain, or behind a valley: (TA:) or simply
a road; as also ↓ مَخْلَفَةٌ; (JK, K;) this being
either in a plain or in a mountain: (TA:) pl. of
the former as above. (K.) One says ذِيخُ الخَلِيفِ
i. e. [The hairy male hyena] of the road between
two mountains, (S, K,) or of the valley between two
mountains; (K) like as one says ذِئْبُ غَضًا. (S.)
-A5-  And A sharp arrow: (AHn, K:) or, accord.
to Skr, the word in this sense is حَلِيفٌ, with the
unpointed ح; and this is more probably correct.
(TA.)
خَلَافَةٌ: see خُلْفَةٌ.
خِلَافَةٌ inf. n. of خَلَفَهُ as meaning “ he was, or
became, his خَلِيفَة ” [q. v.]. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.)
―
-b2-  [And hence, as a simple subst., The office of
خَلِيفَة.]
خَلِيفَةٌ A successor: and a vice-agent, vice-
gerent, lieutenant, substitute, proxy, or deputy:
(KL:) one who has been made, or appointed, to
take the place of him who has been before him:
(JK:) an act. part. n. of خَلَفَهُ, inf. n. خَلَفٌ and
خِلَافَةٌ; as also ↓ خَلِيفٌ: (TA:) or it may have
the meaning of an act. part. n. or that of a pass.
part. n.: and so in the sense next following:
(Msb:) the supreme, or greatest, ruler or sovereign, (S, Msb, K, TA,) who supplies the place of
him who has been before him; (TA;) [particularly the successor of the Prophet; whence
“ Caliph,” commonly used by English writers
for “ Khaleefeh; ”] as also ↓ خَلِيفٌ, (K,) which
is the original form, (Msb,) without ة; (Msb,
TA;) disapproved by some, but mentioned by
AHát and Ibn-' Abbád and IB, and occurring in
a verse of Ows Ibn-Hajar cited by IB: (TA:)
the ة in the former is to denote intensiveness of
signification, (Nh, Msb, TA,) as in عَلَّامَةٌ and
نَسَّابَةٌ: (Msb:) or, as some say, لِلنَّقْلِ [i. e. for
the transference of the word from the category of
epithets to that of substs.]: (TA:) it is also said
that the word may be an epithet of which the
subst. qualified thereby is suppressed, for نَفْسٌ
خَلِيفَةٌ; but this requires consideration: (MF,
TA:) it is an epithet applied to a man peculiarly:
(Msb:) some make it fem.; (Fr, S, Msb, K;)
saying هٰذَا خَلِيفَةٌ أُخْرَى [This is another Khaleefeh]; though the proper way is to make it
masc.: (Msb:) a poet says,
أَبُوكَ خَلِيفَةٌ وَلَدَتْهُ أُخْرَى
وَأَنْتَ خَلِيفَةٌ ذَاكَ الكَمَالُ
[Thy father was a Khaleefeh, whom another
Khaleefeh begat; and thou art a Khaleefeh:
that is perfection]: (Fr, S:) the pl. is خَلَائِفُ
[generally applied to any people that have succeeded others, and supplied their places, as in the
Kur x. 15], (S, K,) like as كَرَائِمُ is pl. of كَرِيمَةٌ;
(S;) and خُلَفَآءُ [generally applied to successors
of the Prophet], (S, K,) because, as it applies
only to the male, and has ة added, the ة is dropped
in forming the pl., which is thus like ظُرَفَآءُ as pl.
of ظَرِيفٌ: (S:) thus says ISk, and the like is
said in the O: but what AHát and Ibn-'Abbád
say requires not this straining: (TA:) [i. e.]
خَلَائِفُ is pl. of خَلِيفَةٌ; and خُلَفَآءُ, of ↓ خَلِيفٌ:
(JK:) or some, having regard to the original,
make the pl. to be خُلَفَآءُ, like as شُرَفَآءُ is pl. of
شَرِيفٌ; (Msb;) and this pl. is masc. only, so
that you say ثَلَاثَةٌ خُلَفَآءَ: (ISk, Msb, TA:) and
some, having regard to the word itself [in its
altered and used state], make the pl. to be
خَلَائِفُ; (Msb;) and this pl. may have prefixed to it either a masc. or a fem. n. of number,
so that you say ثَلَاثَةٌ خَلَائِفَ and ثَلَاثُ خَلَائِفَ;
(ISk, Msb, TA;) both of which are chaste.
(Msb.) You say, كَانَ اللّٰهُ خَلِيفَةَ وَالِدِكَ عَلَيْكَ
[May God be to thee a supplier of the place of
thy father]: (S, Msb: *) and in like manner you
say, to a person, of any one whom he has lost by
death, (S, Msb,) and who cannot be replaced; as
the paternal uncle; (Msb;) or the mother. (K.)
Some say that the application of the title خَلِيفَةُ
اللّٰهِ [The Vicegerent of God] is not allowable, except to Adam and David because there is express
authority in these instances [in the Kur ii. 28 and
xxxviii. 25]; but others allow it in other cases,
like سُلْطَانُ اللّٰهِ and جُنُودُ اللّٰهِ and حِزْبُ اللّٰهِ and
خَيْلُ اللّٰهِ; all of which have been heard: (Msb:)
and Zj says that it is allowable to say of the
Imáms that they are خُلَفَآءُ اللّٰهِ فِى أَرْضِهِ [The
Vicegerents of God in his earth]. (TA.)
خِلِّيفَةٌ: see the middle of the next paragraph.
خَالِفٌ: see خَلْفٌ, in the former half of the
paragraph. ―
-b2-  Also One who remains behind, or
after, another, (Yz, K, TA,) or others, in the
case of a war, or a warring and plundering expedition, and in other cases: (TA:) pl. خَالِفُونَ
(Yz, K, TA) and خَوَالِفُ, which latter is extr. [in
this case], but is also said to be a [reg.] pl. of
↓ خَالِفَةٌ, and as such to signify persons who do not
go forth on a warring, or warring and plundering, expedition: and الغَازِى ↓ خَالِفَةُ signifies he
who remains behind, or after, him who goes forth
on such an expedition, being of his family. (TA.)
فَاقْعُدُوا مَعَ الخَالِفِينَ, in the Kur [ix. 84], means
Then stay ye with those who remain behind. (Yz,
K. *) خَوَالِفُ is also pl. of ↓ خَالِفَةٌ [as fem. of
خَالِفٌ], (TA,) and signifies Women (K, TA) remaining behind in the houses or tents: but some
assign to it the first of the meanings explained
above: and some say that it means the children
remaining behind. (TA.) It is said in the Kur
[ix. 88 and 94], ↓ رَضُوا بِأَنْ يَكُونُوا مَعَ الخَوَالِفِ,
i. e. [They chose to be] with the women: (S, K: *)
thus it is explained by Ibn-'Arafeh: but some
say that the meaning is, with the bad, or corrupt,
persons; and that خوالف is here a pl. [of خَالِفٌ,]
like فَوَارِسُ. (TA.) For ―
-b3-  خَالِفٌ is applied to a
man [as meaning Bad, or corrupt]; and ↓ خَالِفَةٌ
to a woman as meaning bad, or corrupt, and
remaining behind in her abode: and the former
to a slave as meaning bad, or corrupt: and also
contrarious: and in this last sense it is likewise
applied to a companion: and some of the grammarians say that there is no word of the measure
فَاعِلٌ having its pl. of the measure فَوَاعِلُ, except
خَالِفٌ and هَالِكٌ and فَارِسٌ: but see this last:
(TA:) and ↓ خِلِّيفَةٌ, also, has this last signification; (JK, TA;) or [rather] signifies very contrarious; (K;) as also ↓ خَالِفَةٌ; (JK;) and so
↓ خِلَفْنَةٌ, and ↓ خِلَفْنَاةٌ, (Lh, JK, K,) in each of
which the ن is augmentative, and each of which
is applied to a man and to a woman and to a pl.
number; (Lh, K;) but خِلَفْنَيَاتٌ has been mentioned as pl. [of خلفناة], and as applied to males
and females: (TA:) and خَالِفُونَ is likewise used
in this sense applied to a number of men. (JK.)
―
-b4-  Also, applied to a slave, [and app. to any
man, but in this latter case I find it written خلف,
which I believe to be a mistranscription,] One
who has withdrawn from the people of his house:
so says Lh. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Also Stupid; foolish; or
having little, or no, intellect or understanding;
as also ↓ خَالِفَةٌ, (K, TA,) but in an intensive
sense, and also applied to a woman; (TA;) and
↓ أَخْلَفُ, (JK, K,) of which the fem. is خَلْفَآءُ;
(JK, TA;) and ↓ خُلْفُفٌ, (K,) or ↓ خُلْفَفٌ, (L,)
or both, (JK,) likewise applied to a woman, as
also ↓ خُلْفُفَةٌ, (K,) or ↓ خُلْفَفَةٌ: (JK:) or, as
some say, خَالِفٌ signifies one in whom is no good:
and, as also ↓ خَالِفَةٌ, one who has not what suffices:
or who often breaks his promises: (TA:) or both
of these mean one who has not what suffices, and
in whom is no good: or very contrarious. (JM.)
One says that a man is أَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ ↓ خَالِفَةُ and خَالِفُ,
اهل بيته, meaning The one in whom is no good,
of the people of his house: (S, K:) and the
ungenerous: (K:) or the stupid, or foolish: or
the bad, or corrupt, and the evil: and it is [said
to be] tropical. (TA.) And ↓ قَوْمٌ خَوَالِفٌ Persons in whom is no good. (JK.) ―
-b6-  And, [app.
because he leaves his family behind him,] A
drawer of water; (S, TA;) as also ↓ مُسْتَخْلِفٌ
[q. v.]: both mentioned in the K; but السَّقَّآءُ is
there erroneously put for المُسْتَقِى. (TA.) ―
-b7-
And Weak, without appetite for food. (TA.) ―
-b8-
And Flesh-meat from which a slight smell is perceived, but in the chewing of which is no harm.
(Lth, TA.)
-A2-  See also خُلْفٌ.
خَالِفَةٌ: see خَلْفٌ, in the former half of the
paragraph. Also, particularly, [or perhaps أُمَّةٌ
خَالِفَةٌ only in this sense,] A nation, people, or

gender and determinate, being explained by النَّاسِ,
(S,) or because determinate and occupying the
place of a pl., like as one says أَىُّ تَمِيمَ and

part]: (TA:) the pl. is خَوَالِفُ: (S, TA:) which
is hence applied to the angles, or corners, of a
بَيْت: AZ says that the خَالِفَة of a بيت is [app.
the shirt thereof,] beneath the [ropes called]
أَطْنَاب, in the [part called] كِسْر [q. v.]; and it
is also called the خياصة, and the فرجة: [thus I

signs:] and he cites, as an ex.,
مَا خِفْتُ حَتَّى هَتَكُوا الخَوَالِفَ
[app. meaning And I feared not until they rent
open the skirts of the tent, or tents]: (TA:) or,
as some say, the خَالِفَتَانِ are the two sides of a tent,

course of the أَخْلَف.]
