latter [of a rare form,] like دِرْهَمٌ, (TA,) The
little finger: (S, A, K:) or the middle finger:

S, K:) like فِرْسِنٌ, it has no pl. formed by the
addition of ات: (Sb:) its pl. is also used as a
sing., as though every part were termed خنصر;
as in the phrase إِنَّهُ لَعَظِيمُ الخَنَاصِرِ [Verily he
has a large little finger]. (Lh.) You say, فُلَانٌ
تُثْنَى بِهِ الخَنَاصِرُ [The little fingers are bent in
mentioning such a one with others of his class]:
i. e., one begins with him in mentioning persons
of his class. (Msb.) [See 1 in art. ثنى.] And
in like manner you say, عَدُّوهُ بِالخِنْصِرِ [They
counted him with the little finger]: i. e., they
commenced with him in counting. (MF.)
