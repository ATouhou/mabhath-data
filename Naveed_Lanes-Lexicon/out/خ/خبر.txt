↓ اختبر, and ↓ تخبّر; (K;) He knew; or had, or
possessed, knowledge; بِشَىْءٍ [of a thing; generally meaning, with respect to its internal, or
real, state]. (K, TA.)
-A2-  خَبَرَهُ, (S, A, Msb,)
aor.
خَبُرَ, (Msb, MS,) inf. n. خَبْرٌ; (Msb, MS; *)

خَبَرَ,] (A,) inf. n. خَبَرٌ; (TA;) and
↓ اختبِرهُ, and ↓ تخبّرهُ; (TA;) He knew it; syn.
عَلِمَهُ; (S, A, Msb;) [generally meaning, with
respect to its internal, or real, state; like خَبُرَ بِهِ:
see خُبْرٌ, its simple subst., as distinguished from
its inf. n.] You say, مِنْ أَيْنَ خَبَرْتَ هَذَا الأَمْرَ,
(so in a copy of the S,) or خَبِرْتَ, (so in another
copy of the S, and so in the A, where it is expressly said to be with kesr,) Whence knewest thou
this thing? (S, A. *) ―
-b2-  And خَبَرَهُ, (S, K,) aor.
خَبُرَ,
(S,) inf. n. خُبْرٌ and خِبْرَةٌ, (S, K,) or the latter is
a simple subst.; (Msb;) and ↓ اختبرهُ [which is
the more common in this sense]; (S, Msb, K;)
He tried, made trial of, made experiment of,
tested, proved, assayed, proved by trial or experiment or experience him, or it. (S, Msb, K.)
Hence the phrase, (S,) لَأَخْبُرَنَّ خَبَرَكَ, (S, K,) in
some good lexicons خُبْرَكَ, (TA, [and so in the
CK, but this I think to be a mistake, suggested
by the explanation, which is not literal,]) i. q.
لَأَعْلَمَنَّ عِلْمَكَ [which properly signifies I will
assuredly know thy knowledge, or what thou
knowest, but here means, as is shown by the
manner in which the phrase that it explains is
mentioned in the S, I will assuredly try, prove,
or test, thy state, and so know what thou knowest].
(S, K.) [Hence, also,] the saying of Abu-dDardà, وَجَدْتُ النَّاسَ اُخْبُرْ تَقْلِهِمْ, (S,) or تَقْلِهِ,
(A, K,) I found the people to be persons of whom
it is said thus: [Try, prove, or test, them, or
him, and thou wilt hate them, or him:] i. e. there
is not one [of them] but his conduct is hated when
it is tried, or proved, or tested: (K:) or when
thou triest, provest, or testest, them, thou wilt
hate them: the imperative form being used, but
the meaning being that of an enunciative: (S, A,
L, B:) [وَجَدْتُ is a verb of the kind called أَفْعَالُ
القُلُوبِ, which govern two objective complements; therefore اُخْبُرْ تَقْلِهِمْ and اُخْبُرْ تَقْلِهِ are for
مَقْلِيِّينَ عِنْدَ الخِبْرَةِ and مَقْلِيًّا عند الخبرة.]

other copies of the K:) and i. q. مُؤَاكَرَةٌ: (K:)
and ↓ خِبْرٌ is syn. with مُخَابَرَةٌ: (S, K:) it is a
forbidden practice: (A, Mgh, TA:) it is from
خَبِيرٌ signifying “ a tiller, or cultivator, of land: ”
(S, Mgh:) or from خَبَرَ “ he furrowed, or ploughed
(land) for sowing; ” whence خَبِيرٌ also: (Msb:)
or from خَبِرَتِ الأَرْضُ “ the land abounded with
خَبَار: ” or from [the fortress of] خَيْبَر, because
the Prophet made it to remain in the possession
of its inhabitants for half of its revenue; and

informed him, or told him, of what he had, or
knew]. (K. [Whether it be meant that اخبر is
doubly trans. without a particle, in this instance,
like أَعْلَمَ, or whether خبورة be a quasi-inf. n, is
not explained.]) One says also, تُخْبِرُ عَنْ مَجْهُولِهِ
