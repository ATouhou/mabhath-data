خسأ1
خَسَأَ, (S, K,) aor.
خَسَاَ, (K,) inf. n. خَسْءٌ (S, K)
and خُسُوْءٌ, (K,) He drove away a dog: (S, K:)
he chid him. (Lth.)
-A2-  It is also intrans., (S,)
and signifies He (a dog) went away, to a distance; (S, * K;) [being driven away, or chidden;]
as also خَسِئَ, (K,) and ↓ انخسأ. (S, K.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] tropically, said to a man, اِخْسَأْ إِلَيْكَ,
meaning اِخْسَأْ عَنِّى (tropical:)  [Go thou away: or go thou
away from me]. (TA.) اِخْسَؤُوا فِيهَا وَ لَا تُكَلِّمُونِ,
in the Kur [xxiii. 110], is expressive of removal
to a distance with anger; [meaning (assumed tropical:)  Go ye away
into it, (i. e. the fire of Hell,) and speak not unto
Me.] (Zj.) ―
-b3-  [And hence, (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became,
vile and despised and hated: so says Golius, as
on the authority of the KL; but this meaning is
not in my copy of that work: it agrees, however,
with a signification of the part. n. خَاسِئٌ, q. v.]
-A3-  Also, inf. n. خَسْءٌ and خُسُوْءٌ [as above], said
of the sight, (AZ, S, K,) (tropical:)  It was, or became,
dazzled, or confused, (AZ, S, TA,) and dim.
(K, TA.)

خَاسَؤُوا, (K,) inf. n. مُخَاسَأَةٌ, (S,) (tropical:)  They
threw stones, one at another; (S, K;) as also
↓ تخاسؤوا, (K,) or تخاسؤوا بِالحِجَارَةِ. (S.) And
كَانَتْ بَيْنَهُمْ مُخَاسَأَةٌ (tropical:)  [There was between them
a contending in throwing, or throwing of stones].
(S, TA.) [See also art. خسى.] ―
-b2-  And هُوَ يُخَاسِئُ
means يُقَامِرُ [He contends in a game of hazard].

خَسِىْءٌ Bad wool. (O, K.)
خَاسِئٌ, applied to a dog, and to a swine, (K,)
and to a devil, (TA,) Driven away, repelled, and
not suffered to come near to men. (K, TA.) ―
-b2-
And [hence,] (assumed tropical:)  Contemptible, despicable, vile, or
abject. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Applied to the sight, (tropical:)  Dazzled,
or confused, (S, TA,) and dim. (TA.) So in the
words of the Kur [lxvii. 4], يَنْقَلِبُ إِلَيْكَ البَصَرُ
خَاسِئًا (tropical:)  [The sight will recoil to thee dazzled, or
confused, or dim]: (S, TA:) or the meaning here
is (assumed tropical:)  contemptible: or withdrawing far away: or
it is of the measure فَاعِلٌ in the sense of the
measure مَفْعُولٌ, [meaning repelled far away,]
like عِيشَةٍ رَاضِيَةٍ, in the Kur [lxix. 21 and ci. 5],
for مَرْضِيَّةٍ. (TA.)
