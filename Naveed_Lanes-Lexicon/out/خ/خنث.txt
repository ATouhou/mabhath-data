delicacy, tenderness, flabbiness, laxness, or limberness, and an affectation of languor, or languidness: (Msb:) fem. with ة. (TA.) And ↓ خُنُثٌ
(TA) and ↓ مِخْنَاثٌ, (K,) applied to a woman,
(K, TA,) Soft, delicate, tender, flabby, lax, or

ness: (K, TA:) pl. of the latter مَخَانِيثُ. (TA.)
One says to such a woman, ↓ يَاخَنَاثِ, (K,)

خُنْثَى [A hermaphrodite;] one who has what
is proper to the male and what is proper to the
female: Kr makes it an epithet, and says رَجُلٌ
خُنْثَى; (TA;) one who has what is proper to
men and what is proper to women, (S, Mgh, K,)
together; (S, K;) one who has, by creation, the
anterior pudendum of a man and that of a
woman: (Msb:) in the language of the lawyers,
one who has what are proper to both sexes; or
who has neither that of a man nor that of a
woman: but some of them say that the former
meaning is the proper one; and that he who has
no external organ of generation is adjoined to the
class of the خنثى as being subject to the same
special laws: (MF, TA:) the pl. is خَنَاثَى (S,
Mgh, Msb, K) and خِنَاثٌ. (Msb, K.)
-A2-  Also
The plant called بَرْوَاقٌ [i. e. the asphodel]. (K in
art. برق.)
يَا خَنَاثِ: see خَنِتٌ.
خَنِيثٌ A skin of the kind called قِرْبَة folded, or
doubled. (L.)
خُنَاثَةُ: see مُخَنَّثٌ.
خِنَاثَةٌ: see خُنْثٌ.

أَخْنَثُ مِنْ دَلَالِ [More effeminate, or more incapable of venery, than Delál]: a prov. (S, TA.)
Delál was a certain man of El-Medeeneh, (TA,)
who was made a eunuch, together with several
other مُخَنَّثُون. (TA in art. دل. [See Freytag's
Arab. Prov. i. 451; where the name is erroneously written دَلَّال.])
مُخَنَّثٌ, from خَنَّثَ “he bent,” (S, K,) because
of his softness, delicacy, tenderness, flabbiness,
laxness, or limberness, and affectation of languor,
or languidness; (TA;) or from خُنْثَى; (Kh,
JK, MS;) An effeminate man; (T in art. انث,
and TA;) one who resembles a woman in gentleness, and in softness of speech, and in an affectation of languor of the limbs: (TA voce مُؤَنَّثٌ,
q. v.: [see also خَنِثٌ:]) it is written thus and
↓ مُخَنِّثٌ: (TA:) this latter is explained by some
as meaning one who makes his speech like that of
women, in softness and gentleness: (Msb, TA:)
it is also said that both these epithets are used to
signify one who affects languor, or languidness,
of the limbs; one who makes himself like women
in the bending of himself, and in affecting
languor, or languidness, and in speech: but that
one uses the latter epithet only when he means
one who does what is excessively foul, or obscene;
[i. e. a catamite; though this is a meaning often
borne by the former also;] notwithstanding that
تَخْنِيثٌ, as signifying the “committing such an
action,” was unknown to the Arabs [of the
classical ages], and is not found in their language: (MF, TA:) [often, also,] the former
epithet signifies a man incapable of venery:
(MA:) it is said in a trad. that they used to
reckon the مخنّث as one of those having no need
of نِكَاح. (TA in art. ارب.) The مُخَنَّث is also
called ↓ خُنَاثَةُ and ↓ خُنَيْثَةُ [each imperfectly decl.].
(K, TA.)
مُخَنِّثٌ: see what next precedes.
مِخْنَاثٌ: see خَنِثٌ.
