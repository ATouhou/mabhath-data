خَانَهُ, (S, K,) aor. يَخُونُهُ, (S,) inf. n. خِيَانَةٌ
and خَوْنٌ and مَخَانَةٌ (S, K) and خَانَةٌ (K) and
خَائِنَةٌ, of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ, like لَاغِيَةٌ &c.; (TA;)
and ↓ اختانهُ; (S, K;) He was unfaithful, or he
acted unfaithfully, to the confidence, or trust,
that he reposed in him; (K;) [he was treache
rous, perfidious, or unfaithful, to him; or he
acted treacherously, perfidiously, or unfaithfully,
towards him;] فِى كَذَا [in such a thing]: (S:)
خِيَانَةٌ is the contr. of أَمَانَةٌ; and does not relate
only to property, but also to other things: (Mgh:)
or the neglecting, or failing in, أَمَانَةٌ [which is
trustiness, or faithfulness]: (El-Harállee, TA:)
or i. q. نِفَاقٌ, except that خيانة regards a compact
or covenant or the like, and trustiness, or faith
fulness, and نفاق regards religion; so that the
former is the acting contrary to what is right, by
breaking a compact or covenant or the like: (Er
Rághib, TA:) but [it is said that] the primary
signification of خَوْنٌ is the making to suffer loss,
or diminution; because the خَائِن makes the
مَخُون to suffer loss, or diminution, of something.
(TA.) Hence, in the Kur [ii. 183], كُنْتُمْ
أَنْفُسَكُمْ ↓ تَخْتَانُونَ [lit. Ye used to act unfaith
fully to yourselves] means ye used to act un
faithfully, one to another: (S, * TA:) or ye used
to act wrongfully to yourselves: اِخْتِيَانٌ has a
more intensive signification than خِيَانَةٌ. (Bd.)
One says also, خان العَهْدَ He broke the compact
or covenant or the like: whence, تَقُولُ النِّعْمَةُ
كُفِرْتُ وَلَمْ أُشْكَرْ وَتَقُولُ الأَمَانَةُ خُنْتُ وَلَمْ أُحْفَظْ
[The benefit says, I have been disacknowledged,
and have not been requited with thankfulness;
and the trust says, I have been betrayed, and
have not been faithfully kept]: the verb [خُنْتُ]
being here of the measure فُعِلْتُ, a verb of which
the agent is not named. (Mgh.) And خَانَهُ العَهْدَ,
(Msb, K,) and فِى العَهْدِ, (Msb,) and خانهُ الأَمَانَةَ,
(Msb, K,) aor. as above, inf. n. خَوْنٌ and خِيَانَةٌ
and مَخَانَةٌ, (Msb,) [He was unfaithful to him in
respect of the compact or covenant or the like,
and the trust.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,] خان سَيْفُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [His
sword was unfaithful;] i. e., failed of taking ef
fect upon the thing struck with it. (TA.) A cer
tain person, being asked respecting the sword,
said, أَخُوكَ وَ رُبَّمَا خَانَكَ (assumed tropical:)  [It is thy brother, but
sometimes it is unfaithful to thee]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And
خَانَتْهُ رِجْلَاهُ (assumed tropical:)  [His two legs were unfaithful to
him;] he was unable to walk. (TA.) ―

(T, TA,) from softness, or easiness, to hardness,
or difficulty, (TA,) or to evil; (T, TA;) and in
like manner, النَّعِيمُ [enjoyment, &c.]: and of
everything that has altered thy state, or condition,
[for the worse,] one says, ↓ تَخَوَّنَكَ. (T, TA.)

خوّنهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَخْوِينٌ, (K,) He attributed to him خِيَانَة [i. e. treachery, perfidy, or

wasted it, impaired it, or took from it; and so
↓ خوّنهُ, and خوّن مِنْهُ: (K:) or diminished it,
wasted it, impaired it, or took from it, by little

say, تَخَوَنَنِى فُلَانٌ حَقِّى Such a one took from
me by little and little of my right, or due. (S,
TA.) And Dhu-r-Rummeh says,
لَا بَلْ هُوَ الشَّوْقُ مِنْ دَارٍ تَخَوَّنَهَا
مَرًّا سَحَابٌ وَمَرًّا بَارِحٌ تَرِبُ
[No, but it is, or was, yearning of the soul
arising from a place of abode from which some
times raining clouds, and sometimes a hot wind
carrying with it dust, took away by little and
little, so as gradually to efface the traces thereof].
(S, TA.) And Lebeed says, (S, TA,) describing
a she-camel, (TA,)
تَخَوَّنَهَا نُزُولِى وَارْتِحَالِى
[Which my alighting and my journeying had

He paid frequent attention to him, or it; or he,
or it, returned to him, or it, time after time;

in this sense, the former verb is [said to be] from
تخوّلهُ, by the substitution of ن for ل (TA.)
Dhu-r-Rummeh says, [describing a young gazelle,]
لَا يَنْعَشُ الطَّرْفَ إِلَّا مَا تَخَوَّنَهُ

termed بُغَام:] i. e. except when he hears the

(TA in art. بغم: [it is there added, that the
pass. part. n. مَبْغُوم is used in this instance for
the act. part. n.; but for this I see no sufficient
reason:]) he says that the young gazelle is slum
bering, not raising his eye, or eyes, unless his
mother comes to him time after time: or, as
some say, unless his mother's call to him takes
by little and little from his sleep. (S in the
present art.) One says also الحُمَّىتَخَوَّنُهُ [for
تَتَخَوَّنُهُ] The fever returns to him time after
time: (S:) or in its time. (TA.)
