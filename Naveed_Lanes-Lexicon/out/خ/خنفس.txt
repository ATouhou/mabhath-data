خنفسخُنْفَسٌ and its variations: see what here follows.
خُنْفَسَآءُ (S, Msb, K) [in two copies of the S,
in which it is without the article, written without
tenween, but in the Msb and K it has the article
prefixed, and is therefore necessarily without tenween,] and خُنْفُسَآء, (Msb, TA,) which is more
common, (Msb,) [but this I doubt, for I have
found it nowhere else,] and ↓ خُنْفَسٌ (S, K) and
خُنْفُسٌ (TA) and خِنْفِسٌ, (K,) which last is of
the dial. of the people of El-Basrah, (TA,) and
خُنْفُسَةٌ and خُنْفُسَةٌ, (K,) [The black beetle: or a
certain species thereof:] a well-known creeping
thing; (Msb;) a certain insect, (S, K,) black,
(K,) of fetid odour, smaller than the جُعَل, found
in the bottoms of walls: (TA:) the first and
second of these words are both applied to the
male and the female: (Msb:) or خُنْفَسٌ is applied
to the male, (AA, Msb,) by some of the Arabs,
(Msb,) and is syn. with عُنْظَبٌ and حُنْظَبٌ, (AA,
TA,) and خُنْفُسٌ is not disallowable, being agree-
able with analogy: (Msb:) and خُنْفَسَاءَةٌ is applied to the female, [which, if correct, shows
خنفسآء to be with tenween,] and so is خُنْفَسَةٌ:
(S:) or خنفساءة, with ة, is not allowable; [and
if so, خنفسآء is without tenween;] (As, TA;)
and خنفسة is [not applied to the female, but]
used by the Benoo-Asad for خنفسآء, as though
they made the ة a substitute for the ا: (Msb:)
[and this seems to indicate that the ا is a fem. ا,
grammatically speaking, and that the word is
therefore without tenween:] the pl. is خَنَافِسُ.
(Msb.) One says, هُوَ أَلَحُّ مِنَ الخُنْفَسَآءِ [He is
more persevering than the black beetle]: because
it returns to thee as often as thou throwest it
away. (TA.)
[Accord. to the K, the ن in the words of this
art. is radical; but accord. to the S and Msb,
augmentative.]
