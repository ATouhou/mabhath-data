syn. with خَبْتٌ [A low, or depressed, tract of
ground: &c.]. (K. [So accord. to my MS.
copy of the K, and accord. to the TA: but in the
CK this signification is omitted; for instead of
والخَبْتُ وَبِالضَّمِّ السَّذَابُ, we find وَالخَفْتُ بِالفَتْحِ
وَبِالضَّمِّ السَّذَابُ, meaning that حَفْتٌ and خُفْتٌ
signify the same as سَذَابٌ.])
خُفْتٌ [and accord. to the CK خَفْتٌ, but this
is app. a mistake, (see what next precedes,)] i. q.

You say اِمْرَأَةٌ خَفْوتٌ لَفُوتٌ: (Lth, A, TA:) لفوت

-b3-  سَحَابٌ خَافِتٌ Clouds
in which is no water. (Aboo-Sa'eed, K.) A

TA,) which at one time inclines, and at another
time stands straight; accord. to A 'Obeyd, خافت
meaning what is fresh, or juicy, and soft, or
tender: or, accord. to one reading, to خَافِتَةُ الزَّرْعِ,
meaning fresh, or juicy, seed-produce, that is
soft, or tender, and weak; the ة being added in
خافته as though by زرع were meant سُنْبُلَة.
