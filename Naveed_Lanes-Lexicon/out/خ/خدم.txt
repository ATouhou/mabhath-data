as also ↓ اِخْتَدَمْتُهُ: (TA:) [or I took him as my
servant:] or I made him to serve me. (Msb)
Accord. to El-Kutb Er-Ráwendee, one says,
اِسْتَخْدَمْتُهُ لِنَفْسِى and لِغَيْرِى [I took him as a
servant for myself and for another than myself:
or I made him to be a servant to myself and to

خَدَمٌ: see خَادِمٌ:
-A2-  and see also خَدَمَةٌ, in
four places.
خَدْمَةٌ, (K,) or ↓ خِدْمَةٌ, (JK,) A space, or
period, (سَاعَةٌ,) of the night (JK, K) or of the
day: (K:) and خَذْمَةٌ [or خِذْمَةٌ, q. v.,] is a dial.
var. thereof. (TA.)
خُدْمَةٌ a subst. signifying (assumed tropical:)  The characteristic
denoted by the epithet خَدْمَآءُ [fem. of أَخْدَمُ], in
a sheep or goat; (JK, K, TA;) i. e. whiteness in
the lower end of the shank. (JK, K,) upon blackness;
(K;) such whiteness resembling the خَدَمَة, (JK,
TA,) or being likened to خَدَم, or anklets: (TA:)
or blackness upon whiteness: &c. (K.) [See
أَخْدَمُ: and see also خَدَمَةٌ.]
خِدْمَةٌ, accord. to some, and inf. n. of 1: accord.
to others, a simple subst. [signifying Service].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  [Also Pay for service: but in this
sense probably post-classical.]
-A2-  See also خَدْمَةٌ.
خَدَمَةٌ A thong, (JK, S, K,) plaited, (TA,)
thick and strong, like a ring, (JK, K,) which is
fastened upon the pastern of a camel, (JK, S, K,)
and to which is attached the سَرِيحَة [or thong] of
the نَعْل [or leathern shoe with which the foot is
sometimes protected], (S,) or to which are attached
the سَرَائِح [or thongs] of the نعل: (K:) [it is the
n. un. of ↓ خَدَمٌ: and its pl. is خِدَامٌ; as below:
in the TA, said to be tropical; but this is pro-
bably a mistake: the other significations here
following are all tropical:] accord. to AA, [the
pl.] خِدَامٌ signifies shackles, or hobbles; syn.
قُيُودٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (S,) (tropical:)  i. q. خَلْخَالٌ [meaning An anklet]; (JK, S, Mgh, K;) because
sometimes made of thongs, with gold and silver
affixed thereon: (S:) pl. خِدَامٌ, (S,) and [coll.
gen. n.] ↓ خَدَمٌ. (Ham p. 612.) كَالْمَمْهُورَةٍ إِحْدَى
خَدَمَتَيْهَا is a prov. [meaning (assumed tropical:)  Like her who has
been dowered with one of her two anklets]. (JK,
TA. [See also مَهْمُورَةٌ.]) ―
-b3-  [And hence, (assumed tropical:)  A ring
of white a little above the hoof of a horse &c.]
You say of a horse, لَهُ خَدَمَتَانِ مِنْ خِلَافٍ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He has a whiteness [or rather a ring of
white a little above the hoof] in his fore leg [or
right fore leg] and another in his left fore leg
[probably a mistake of a copyist for his left kind
leg]. (TA in art. خلف.) [The coll. gen. n.
↓ خَدَمٌ is used in the Deewán of the Hudhalees,
as stated by Freytag, in the sense of (assumed tropical:)  A place
where the colour differs, like an anklet, on the
foot: and a whiteness on the foot of a bull, surrounding it like a circle: and خِدَامٌ as meaning
whiteness: or, as some say, streaks (“striæ”).
See also خُدْمَةٌ.] ―
-b4-  [Hence, also,] (assumed tropical:)  The place
where each foot comes forth from the trousers.
(TA.) ―
-b5-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The shank; (K;) because it is
the place of the خَدَمَة, i. e. the anklet: (TA:)
pl. خِدَامٌ and [coll. gen. n.] ↓ خَدَمٌ. (K.) Hence,
in a trad. of Selmán, كَانَ عَلَى حِمَارٍ وَعَلَيْهِ سَرَاوِيلُ
وَخَدَمَتاهُ تُذَبْذِبَانِ [He was upon an ass, and upon
him were trousers, and his shanks were dangling]:
or, as some say, the meaning here is, the parts
from which his two feet came forth, of the trousers. (TA.) And one says, أَبْدَتِ الحَرْبُ عَنْ
خِدَامِ المُخَدَّرَاتِ (tropical:)  [The war made apparent the
shanks, or the anklets, of the girls that had been
kept behind the curtains]; meaning the war became vehement. (A, TA.) ―
-b6-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A ring of
people; (S, K;) a compact ring thereof: likened
to the thong described in the first sentence of this
paragraph. (TA.) Hence the saying of Khálid
Ibn-El-Weleed, in a letter that he wrote to the
Satraps of Persia, (TA,) الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِى فَضَّ
خَدَمَتَكُمْ, meaning [Praise be to God,] who hath
dispersed, or broken up, your congregation: (S, *
K, * TA:) for when the thong above mentioned
is broken, or parted, the سَرَائِح [or thongs of the
leathern shoe] become loosed, and the shoe falls
off: so says IAth, and A'Obeyd says the like.
(TA.)
خَدِمَةٌ A thong: (K:) or a plaited thong.
(TA.)
خَدُومٌ: see what next follows.
خَدَّامٌ One who does much service; (TA in the
present art.;) as also ↓ خَدُومٌ. (TA in art. عقرب.)
And also applied to A خَادِم [q. v.]. (TA in the
present art. [It is commonly used in the latter
sense in the present day: fem. with ة.])
خَادِمٌ A servant; (S, * Mgh, * Msb, * K, * TA;)
applied to a young man, (S, Mgh, Msb,) or a
male: (K:) and, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) as also
خَادِمَةٌ, (Msb, K,) each in chaste Arabic, (TA,)
but the latter rare, (Msb,) to a young woman,
(S, Mgh, Msb,) or a female: (K:) and خَدَّامٌ
[q. v.] is also used in the same sense as خَادِمٌ:
(TA:) the pl. of خَادِمٌ is ↓ خَدَمٌ, (JK, S, Mgh,
Msb, K,) or rather this is a quasi-pl. n., (TA,)
and خُدَّامٌ (JK, Msb, K) and خَدَمَةٌ, and vulgarly
خُدْمَانٌ. (TA.) It is said in a trad., of 'Abd-Er-Rahmán, (TA,) طَلَّقَ امْرَأَتَهُ فَمَتَّعَهَا بِخَادِمٍ سَوْدَآءَ,
meaning [He divorced his wife, and gave her on
that occasion] a black young woman [as a slave].
(Mgh, * TA.) In the saying فُلَانَةُ خَادِمَةُ غَدًا, the
word خادمة is not properly an epithet: the meaning is, Such a woman will be a servant to-morrow;
like as one says حَائِضَةٌ غَدًا. (Msb.)
[
خَادِمِيَّةٌ Servitude; or the state, or condition, of
a servant: a term in common use; and mentioned
by Freytag on the authority of Meyd.: opposed
to مَخْدُومِيَّةٌ.]
أَخْدَمُ i. q. ↓ مُخَدَّمُ, (S, Mgh, K,) as meaning,
applied to a horse, (tropical:)  Having a whiteness (S,
Mgh) such as is termed تَحْجِيل (S) surrounding
the pastern of each kind foot, (S Mgh,) above
the parts next the hoof, and stopping short of the
shank; (S;) but not in the fore foot: (S, Mgh:
[see 2:]) or, so applied, whose تَحْجِيل encircles
[the pastern] above the أَشَاعِر [or extremities next
the hoof]: or the latter epithet, so applied, whose
whiteness passes beyond the pasterns or part thereof.
(K.) And خَدْمَآءُ, [fem. of أَخْدَمُ,] applied to a
sheep or goat, (JK, S, K,) i. e. to a شَاة, (S, K,)
(assumed tropical:)  Having in the lower end of her shank a whiteness
(JK, K) like the خَدَمَة [or anklet], (JK,) upon
blackness; or a blackness upon whiteness; and in
like manner applied to a mountain-goat: (K:)
or having white shanks; (AZ, S, K;) like
حَجْلَآءُ; [but see this latter word;] and so
↓ مُخَدَّمٌ applied to a mountain-goat: (S:) or
having one white shank; the rest of her being
black. (K.)
مُخَدَّمٌ [pass. part. n. of 2, q. v.]. You say قَوْمٌ
مُخَدَّمُونَ A people, or party, having many servants and other dependents. (S, K.) And in like
manner مُخَدَّمَةٌ is applied to a woman. (A, TA.)
-A2-  And مُخَدَّمَةٌ (tropical:)  A woman attired, or adorned,
with anklets. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  See also أَخْدَمُ, in
two places.
-A3-  And مُخَدَّمٌ and ↓ مُخَدَّمَةٌ (S, K)
The place of the thong [called خَدَمَة] (K, TA)
in the leg of the camel: (TA: [there said to be
above the كَعْب; but this is a mistake:]) and
(assumed tropical:)  the place of the anklet [so called] (K, TA) in
the shank of a woman: (TA:) the place of the
خِدَام in the shank: (S:) the place of the خَدَمَ;
like as مُسَوَّرٌ is the place of the سِوَار. (M in explanation of the former, in art. سور.) ―
-b2-  And the
former (tropical:)  The band of the trousers, (JK, K, TA,)
at the lower part of the leg of a woman: (K,
TA:) or the band at the lower part of the leg of
the trousers: (M, TA:) the woman seems to be
specified in the K because women generally tic
the legs of the trousers upon the middle [or upper
part] of the shank, and then make them to fall
down over it. (TA.)
مُخَدَّمَةٌ as a subst.: see مُخَدَّمٌ; of which it is
also the fem.
مَخْدُومٌ [lit. Served: ―
-b2-  and hence, A master;]
a head, or chief: pl. مَخَادِيمُ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And A
man having a servant of the jinn, or genii.
(S, K.)
[
مَخْدُومِيَّةٌ The state, or condition, of a master:
opposed to خَادِمِيَّةٌ.]
