خطو1
خَطَا, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) aor. يَخْطُو, (Msb,)
inf. n. خَطْوٌ; (Msb, K;) and ↓ اختطى; (S, K;)
said of a man (S, Msb, TA) [and of a beast];
both signify the same; (S, K;) He stepped,
paced, or walked; (MA, KL;) i. q. مَشَى; (M,
Msb, K;) as also اِخْتَاطَ, [which see in art. خيط,]
formed by transposition. (K.) You say, خَطَوْتُ
خَطْوَةً وَاحِدَةً [I stepped one step]. (JK.) [And
وَسَّعَ الخَطْوَ He stepped wide.] See also the last
sentence of the next paragraph.

خطّى He made to pass over: so in the
saying, خَطَّى اللّٰهُ نَوْءَهَا God made, or may God
make, its (a land's) [rain-giving] star or asterism
to pass it over, and not send rain upon it: (TA
in art. خطأ:) but in this case the verb is, (Mgh
in that art.,) or may be, (TA ibid.,) originally
خَطَّطَ, the final ط being changed into ى. (Mgh
and TA ibid. [See 2 in art. خطأ.]) Accord. to
Fr, خَطَّى السَّهْمَ and خطأ are syn. [as meaning
He made the arrow to pass over, or to miss, the
mark]. (TA in art. خطأ.) One says also, in
praying for a man, خُطِّىَ عَنْهُ السُّوْءُ [May evil be
made to pass him; or] may evil be repelled from
him: and one says also خُطِّىَ عَنْكَ May it be
removed, or put away, from thee: (S, TA:) or
خُطِّئَ عَنْكَ السُّوْءُ. (ISk, TA in art. خطأ.)
-A2-  The
vulgar say [to a she-ass and to a she-camel or
other beast in a slippery or difficult place] خَطِّى,
meaning اِمْشِى [for اِمْشِى رُوَيَدًا Step thou leisurely]: but the correct word is ↓ اُخْطُِى [imperative fem. of خَطَا]. (TA.)
4
اخطاهُ He (a man) made him (another man)
to step, pace, or walk. (S, TA.)
-A2-  أَخْطَيْتُ for
أَخْطَأْتُ: see the latter.
5
تَخَطَّيْتُهُ I stepped, or walked, over him, or
it: (Msb:) or I passed over and beyond him, or
it: (S:) or تخطّى النَّاسَ He went over the people,
(رَكِبَهُمْ,) and passed beyond them; and so
↓ اِخْتَطَاهُمْ. (K.) One says, تَخَطَّيْتُ رِقَابَ النَّاسِ
[I stepped over, walked over, passed over and beyond, or went over and passed beyond, the necks
of the people]. (S, TA.) It is said in a trad. respecting Friday, [of one who came too late to the
Friday-prayers, as is shown in the TA in art.
انى,] رَأَى رَجُلًا يَتَخَطَّى رِقَابَ النَّاسِ He saw a man
passing step by step [over the necks of the people who
were already in their ranks in the mosque]. (TA.
[See also Har p. 83.]) One says also, فُلَانٌ لَا
يَتَخَطَّى عَنِ الطُّنُبِ [Such a one will not step over,
or beyond, or from, the tent-rope], meaning, will
not go far from the tent for the purpose of voiding
his excrement, by reason of his foulness and vileness and uncleanness. (TA.) And تَخَطَّيْتُ
كَذَا (S, TA) I passed over [to such a thing or
place or person]: (TA:) one should not say
تَخَطَّأْتُ [in this sense], with ء. (S, TA.) [Hence
the following tropical phrases.] تخطّاهُ المَكْرُوهُ
(tropical:)  [What was disliked or hated, or evil, passed over
him; not alighting upon him]. (TA.) And
تَخَطَّيْتُ إِلَيْهِ بِالمَكْرُوهِ (tropical:)  [I passed over others to
him with that which was disliked or hated, or
evil; i. q. تَجَاوَزْتُ]. (TA.) And تخطّى عَنِّى
بَصَرُكَ (assumed tropical:)  [Thine eye, or thy sight, passed me over].
(Aboo-Turáb, TA in art. تيه.) ―
-b2-  [Also (assumed tropical:)  I overstepped it, or transgressed it; namely, a limit
prescribed to me, &c.]

إِخْتَطَوَ see 1:
-A2-  and see also 5.
خَطْوَةٌ A step, or pace, as meaning a single act
of stepping or pacing or walking: (JK, S, K,
Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] خَطَوَاتٌ (S, Msb, K) and
[of mult.] خِطَآءٌ. (S.) Imra-el-Keys says,
لَهَا وَثَبَاتٌ كَوَثْبِ الشِّبَآءِ
فَوَادٍ خِطَآءٌ وَوَادٍ مَطِرْ
[She has bounds like the bounding of gazelles;
and a valley is stepped over by her with leisurely
steps, and a valley is trampled over by her rapidly as though it were rained upon]: (S:) i. e.,
one time she steps, and refrains from running;
and one time she runs with a running resembling
rain: but AO relates it otherwise, saying, فَوَادٍ
خَطِيطٌ [lit. and a valley is not rained upon]: and
some substitute كَصَوْبِ الخَرِيفِ [like the pouring
rain of the autumn]. (IB, TA.) [See also what
next follows.]
خُطْوَةٌ A step, or pace, as meaning the space
between the two feet [in walking or running]: pl.
(of pauc., S) خُطْوَاتٌ (S, Msb, K) and خُطُوَاتٌ
and خُطَوَاتٌ (S, Msb) and (of mult., S) خُطًى.
(S, Msb, K.) One says, قَرَّبَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ الخُطْوَةَ,
meaning May God make short to thee the space,
or distance. (TA.) And بَيْنَ القَوْلَيْنِ خُطٍى يَسِيرَةٌ
(assumed tropical:)  Between the two sayings is little difference.
(TA.) لَا تَتَّبِعُوا خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ, in the Kur
[ii. 163 &c.], means [Follow not ye] the ways of
the Devil: (TA:) or the footsteps of the Devil:
(JK:) here some read خُطْوَات; and some, accord.
to Lth, خُطُؤَات, which Az pronounces to have no
meaning. (TA.)
خَطِيَّةٌ for خَطِيْئَةٌ: see the latter, in art. خطأ.
[Freytag, evidently from his having found it incorrectly written for حَظِيَّةٌ, has assigned to it the
meaning of “ amica,” and “ amata. ”]
نَاقَتُكَ هٰذِهِ مِنَ المُتَخَطِّيَاتِ الجيف [the last
word being app. الجِيَفَ] is a saying mentioned
by AZ: (TA in the present art.:) or من
المُتَخَطِّئَاتِ الجيف. (TA in art. خطأ, where see
the explanation.)
