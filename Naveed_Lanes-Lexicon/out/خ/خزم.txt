خزم1
خَزَمَهُ, aor.
خَزِمَ, (Mgh, K,) inf. n. خَزْمٌ, (JK,
TA,) He pierced it, or perforated it; (JK,
Mgh, K;) namely, a thing of any kind: for
instance, the nose of a camel, for the [ring called]
خِزَامَة [to which the rein is attached]: and the
letter of a Kádee to another Kádee; for such a
letter is pierced for the سِحَآءَة [or strip of paper
with which it is bound], and is then sealed [upon
this strip]; and when this is done, the letter is
said to be ↓ مَخْزُومٌ. (Mgh.) You say, خَزَمَ
البَعِيرَ, aor. as above, (Mgh, Msb,) and so the
inf. n., (Msb,) He pierced the nose of the camel
(Mgh, Msb) for the خِزَامَة: (Mgh:) or خَزَمَ
البَعِيرَ (S, K) بِالخِزَامَةِ, (S,) aor. and inf. n. as
above, (TA,) he put the خزامة in the side of
the nostril, (K,) or in the partition between the
nostrils, (S,) [but the former is the more common
practice,] of the camel; (S, K;) as also ↓ خزّمهُ;
(K;) [or] this signifies the doing so much, or
often. (TA.) [Hence,] خَزَمَ أَنْفَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He brought
him under, or into, subjection; rendered him submissive, tractable, or manageable. (TA.) And
خَزَمْتُ الجَرَادَ فِى العُودِ I spitted the locusts in a
series upon the [skewer, or] piece of stick or
wood. (S.) And خَزَمَ شِرَاكَ نَعْلِهِ He pierced and
tied the [thong called] شَراك [q. v.] of his sandal
[app. so as to attach to it the two branches (عَضُدَا
الشِّرَاكِ) of the strap that encompasses the heel].
(TA, [See also خِزَامَةٌ.]) ―
-b2-  [Also He cut it.
for] الخَزْمُ is syn. with القَطْعُ. (Ham p. 166.
[It is there also said to be syn. with الشد; i. e.
الشَّدُّ; but this is app. a mistake for الشَّكُّ, a
meaning assigned to it in the JK, agreeably with
the K.])

i. e. When he turns her, meaning his she-camel,
from the right way, she pursues with him a way
different from the wrong, so that she overcomes
him, and takes the right way, in the early daytime of the morrow. (TA.) مُخَازَمَةٌ also signifies
The act of rivalling, or imitating. (JK, TA.)
And one says, لَقِيتُهُ خِزَامًا (JK, TA) and مَخَازَمَةً,
(JK,) meaning I met him face to face: (TA:)
or suddenly, or unexpectedly, and face to face.

to the book entitled مَا لَا يَسَعُ الطَّبِيبَ جَهْلَهُ, as
stated by Golius, a certain wild herb, having a
long stalk, small leaves, red flower, and very sweet
odour:] its flower is the sweetest of flowers in
odour; the fumigation therewith dispels every
fetid odour; the use thereof as a suppository in
the vagina promotes pregnancy; and the taking
it internally restores to a right state the liver and
the spleen, and the brain affected with cold: (K:)
[in the present day, applied to the common lavender; lavandula spica:] n. un. خُزَامَاةٌ. (TA.)

mistake, app. caused by an omission in the K.]
اريحٌ خَازِمٌ (assumed tropical:)  A cold wind; as though it pierced
through the extremities: so says Kr: A'Obeyd
says خَارِمٌ: accord. to the K, both signify the

none others than stupid, or foolish, persons. (TA.
[But كَالْأَنْعَامِ is app., here, a mistranscription
for كَالنَّعَامِ; for the ostrich is proverbial for stupidity: one says أَحْمَقُ مِنْ نَعَامَةٍ “ More stupid
than an ostrich: ” because, as Meyd says, when an
ostrich happens to see the eggs of another ostrich,
it will sit upon them, and forget its own eggs.])
