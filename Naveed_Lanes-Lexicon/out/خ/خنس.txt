you see a star [thereof] in the end of a sign of
the zodiac, it returns to the beginning of it: (Jel:)
or because of their retrogression; for they are
the erratic stars (الكَوَاكِبُ المُتَحَيَّرِةُ), which [at

time to] pursue a direct [and forward] course:
(S:) or because they sometimes return (تخنس)

tick: (Sgh, K:) and the lion; and so ↓ خِنَّوْسٌ;
(K;) which last is an epithet so applied as relating to his face and his nose: (Fr, TA:) and
