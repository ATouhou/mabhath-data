signify the same. (K in art. خيت.) ―

of the people, or party, and learns it by heart
[one part after another]. (S, K. *) In [some of]

upon their strength, and robbing and slaying
men]. (S: [in two copies of which I find يَسِيرُونَ
in the place of يَسْرُونَ.])
خَوَاتٌ The sound made by the motion of the
wings of an eagle. (S, K. [In a copy of the S,
I find it said that this word is fem., though its
meaning is masc.; and the same is said in the
TA, doubtless from another copy of the S; but
this observation, which is omitted in one copy of
the S in my possession, applies to خَوَاةٌ, mentioned
in art. خوى in the S, as meaning صَوْتٌ.]) And
A sound [absolutely]; (K;) as also ↓ خَوَاتَهُ:
(TA:) or the sound, or noise, of thunder, and of
a torrent, or flow of water. (AHn, K.) A poet
says,
فَلَاحِسَّ إِلَّا خَوَاتُ السُّيُولِ
[And there was no sound but the noise of the
torrents]; (AHn, TA;) which shows that we
should read in the K وَالسَّيْلِ; not والسيلُ, as in
some copies. (TA.)
خَوَاتَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
خَوَّاتٌ A bold, daring, brave, or courageous,
man. (S, K.) ―
