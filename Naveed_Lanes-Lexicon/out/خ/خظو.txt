of the “ Deewán el-Hudhaleeyeen,” as signifying

خَظَوَانٌ One whose flesh is such [in thickness,

خَاظٍ Compact, applied to flesh; (TA;) and
so بَظَا ↓ خَظَا, (S, TA,) likewise applied to flesh,

The Saadee says, (accord. to the TA, 'Ámir Ibn-Et-Tufeyl,)
رِقَابٌ كَالمَوَاجِنِ خَاظِيَاتٌ
وَأَسْتَاهٌ عَلَى الأَكْوَارِ كُومُ
[Compact necks like the bleachers' beating implements, and rumps elevated upon the camels'
saddles]. (S.) In the saying of Imra-el-Keys,
كَمَا ↓ لَهَا مَتْنَتَانِ خَظَاتَا
أَكَبَّ عَلَى سَاعِدَيْهِ النَّمِرْ
[She has two compact portions of flesh and sinew
confining her back-bone, like as appear when the
leopard falls prostrate upon his fore shanks],
he means خَظَاتَانِ, suppressing the ن for the purpose of alleviation of the utterance: (Fr, S:) or,
as some say, he means ↓ خَظَتَا, restoring the ا that
fell out on account of the concurrence of two
quiescent letters in the sing. [i. e. خَظَاتْ, for خَظَتْ
is formed from خَظَاتْ, which is from خَظَوَتْ,]
when the ت has become movent. (S.) ―
-b2-  خَاظٍ
also signifies Thick, and hard, firm, or rigid:
(TA:) and [so, or simply] thick, applied to an
arrow. (AHn, TA.) And one says سَاعِدٌ خَاظِى
البَضِيعِ [A fore arm, or an upper arm,] full of
flesh. (IB, TA in art. بضع.) And رَجُلٌ خَاظِى
البَضِيعِ (As, S in art. بضع) A fat man. (TA in
that art.)
