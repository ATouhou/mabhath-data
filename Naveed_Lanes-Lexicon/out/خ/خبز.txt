خُبْزٌ a word of well-known meaning; (K;)
[Bread;] that which is eaten. (S.) It is said
in a prov., كُلُّ أَدَاةِ الخُبْزِ عِنْدِى غَيْرُهُ [All the
apparatus of bread is in my possession except it,
namely, the bread itself]: the origin of which
was this: a company of men demanded hospitality of a certain man; and when they sat down,
he threw down a [piece of leather such as is
called] نِطْع, and put upon it a mill-stone, and
adjusted its pivot, and covered it [with the upper
stone]: and the presence of his apparatus made
the company to wonder: then he took the handle
of the mill, (هَادِى الرَّحَى,) and began to turn
it: whereupon they said to him, What dost thou?
and he answered in the words of this proverb.
