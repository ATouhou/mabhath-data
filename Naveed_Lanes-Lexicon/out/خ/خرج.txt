because of the responsibility which he has borne
for him: (A, * Mgh, * K, TA:) for one purchases

wherefore he has a right to return him and to
receive back the price; but the revenue which he

property, because he had been responsible for
him; and if he had perished, part of his property
had perished: (K, * TA:) in a similar manner

slave or to other property. (TA.) ―

the players holds a thing in his hand and says to
the others, Elicit ye (أَخْرِجُوا) what is in my
hand: in the T, ↓ خراج and خريج are explained
by the word مُخَارَجَةٌ [meaning micare digitis;

in ancient and modern Italy, and in very remote
times in Egypt, in which one of the players puts
