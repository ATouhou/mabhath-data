خب1
خَبَّ, (A, L, K,) sec. pers. خَبِبْتَ, like

خَبَّ, [sec. pers. خَبَبْتَ,] aor. يَخُبُّ, like يَقْتُلُ,
inf. n. خَبٌّ; (Msb; [in which خِبٌّ is regarded
as a simple subst.; but I doubt the correctness

wicked, dishonest, or dissimulating, (K, TA,) and
a mischief-maker: (TA:) [or] he was, or became,
a great deceiver, or very deceitful, (S, A, L, K,

(S, * A, * L, TA.) [In the K and TA, neither
the aor. nor the inf. n. of خَبَّ as signifying “ he
was, or became, a great deceiver, or very deceitful,” is specified; nor the sec. pers. of the pret.,
which indicates the form of the aor.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,
app.,] خَبَّ signifies also He alighted and abode
in a depressed tract of ground, in order that his
place might be unknown, from a motive of niggardliness [to avoid claims upon his hospitality,
thus deceiving passers by]. (K, TA.) ―
-b3-  And

-A2-  خَبَّ, (S, A, K,) aor. يُخُبُّ, with damm, (S,
A,) deviating from a general rule, accord. to
which an intrans. v. of this class [of the measure
فَعَلَ] should be with kesr, (MF,) inf. n. خَبٌّ
(S, K) and خَبَبٌ and خَبِيبٌ, (S, A, K,) He went

And خَبَّ فِى الأَمْرِ, aor.
خَبُ3َ, inf. n. خَبَبٌ, He

خَبَّ, (aor. يَخُبُّ, TA, [inf. n. خَبٌّ,]) said of the
sea, (tropical:)  It was, or became, agitated, or in a state of
commotion; (T, S, A, K, TA;) the waves dashing together, and the winds whirling; (T, A,

or cast anchor. (T, TA.) You say, أَصَابَهُمُ الخَبُّ
(tropical:)  Agitation, or commotion, of the sea, with a

صَدِيقَهُ, (Aboo-Bekr, TA,) and عَبْدَهُ, and حَلِيلَتَهُ,

He stayed until the mid-day heat had become
assuaged, and the air was cool: (K:) or the
phrase is خَبْخَبَ عَنْهُ مِنَ الظَّهِيرَةِ. (TA.) [Hence,
in a trad. relating to the postponement of the
noon prayers,] خَبْخِبُوا عَنْكُمْ مِنَ الظَّهِيرَةِ, (S,)
or فِى الظَّهِيرَةِ, (JK, [but the former is more
probably the correct phrase,]) Stay ye until the
mid-day heat shall have become assuaged, and

خَبٌّ (JK, S, A, L, Msb, K) [said in the Msb
to be originally an inf. n.] and ↓ خِبٌّ (S, L, K)
[originally an inf. n. accord. to most authorities]
and ↓ خُبٌّ, (MF,) applied to a man, (S, A, L,
Msb,) fem. خَبَّةٌ, [which casts doubt upon the

أَخْبَابٌ: see, again, خِبَّةٌ. ―
-b2-  أَخْبَابُ الفَحِثِ The

a جَذَع [or sheep in or before its second year],

accord. to most of the leading lexicologists;
though said in the K to be a mistake of J, for
جَنِيبَةٌ. (TA.)
