find قِدْح. Golius explains خَيَّابٌ as meaning
ignitabulum fallens, quod non excudit semina
ignis: but I cannot anywhere find قَدْحٌ or قِدْحٌ
in the sense which he assigns to one of these
words, which is that of مِقْدَحَةٌ &c.]) ―

اُسْكُتْ وَلَا تَنْطِقْ فَأَنْتَ خَيَّابْ
كُلُّكَ ذُو عَيْبٍ وَأَنْتَ عَيَّابٌ
حيّاب may be [an epithet] of the measure فَعَّال
from الخَيْبَةُ; [so that the meaning may be (assumed tropical:)  Be
thou silent, and speak not, for thou art habitually
unsuccessful; thou art altogether vitious, or
faulty, and thou art a great imputer of vices,
or faults, to others;] or the person there men
tioned may be meant to be likened to the قدح
above mentioned. (TA.) ―
