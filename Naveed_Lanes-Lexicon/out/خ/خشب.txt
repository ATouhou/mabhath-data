خشب1
خَشَبَ, (S, K,) aor.
خَشِبَ, (K,) inf. n. خَشْبٌ,
(TA,) He mixed a thing (S, K) with (بِ) another
thing. (S.) ―
-b2-  And He picked out, chose out, or
selected, a thing: the verb thus having two contr.
significations. (K, TA.)
-A2-  Also, (S, K,) aor.
and inf. n. as above, (S,) He polished a sword,
(S, K,) by laying on it a broad and smooth spearhead and rubbing it therewith: so accord. to ElAhmar, who relates that an Arab of the desert
said to him, I said to a sword-polisher, “Hast
thou finished my sword? ” and he answered, نَعَمْ
إِلَّا أَنِّى لَمْ أَخْشِبْهُ [Yes, except that I have not
polished it]. (S.) And [or, as in the TA, “or ”]
He sharpened it. (K, TA.) ―
-b2-  And He forged a
sword: (K:) or fashioned it with the file, without polishing it: (TA:) or he made it imperfectly,
not thoroughly, or not well: (A:) thus, again,
the verb has two contr. significations: (K:) also
he thus made an arrow: (A:) or he shaped out a
bow, (AHn, K,) and an arrow, (TA,) [in a rough
manner, or] by the first operation, (AHn, K,
TA,) without perfecting it, or making it smooth,
or even. (TA.) You say of a sword, before it
has been filed, مَا أَحْسَنَ مَا خُشِبَ [How well has
it been forged!]: and in like manner one says of
an arrow, when it has been filed, before the سَفَن
[with which it is smoothed] has been applied to
it. (Skr, on a verse of Sakhr, cited below, voce
خَشِيبَةٌ.) ―
-b3-  [Hence,] خَشَبَ الشِّعْرَ, (ISk, S, A, K,)
aor. and inf. n. as above, (A,) (tropical:)  He said, spoke,
or uttered, the poetry (ISk, S, A, K) as it came,
(ISk, S,) [unpolished, and unstudied,] without
affecting nicety, or refinement, therein, (ISk, S, A,
K,) and without study, or labour: (A, K:) Jereer
did thus, and Farezdak trimmed his verses; but
the verses of Jereer thus produced are better than
the trimmed verses of Farezdak: (A, TA:) and
↓ اختشبهُ signifies the same. (A, K.) You say
also, هُمْ يَخْشِبُونَ الكَلَامَ وَالعَمَلَ (tropical:)  [They say,
speak, or utter, words, and do work, without
affecting nicety, or refinement, and without study,
or labour]: (A:) or imperfectly, or not thoroughly; inelegantly, or not well. (TA.) And
اِتَّخَذَ السَّيْفَ خَشَبًا: see 8.
5
تخشّب: see 8.
-A2-  تخشّبتِ الإِبِلُ The camels
ate thick branches: (K:) or ate dry herbage.
(S.) And تَتَخَشَّبُ عِيدَانَ الشَّجَرِ They take with
the mouth, and eat, the branches of the trees.
(TA.)
8
اختشب السَّيْفِ signifies ↓ اِتَّخَذَهُ خَشْبًا; He
took the sword without choosing the best by taking
it from this place or that; (L, TA;) as also
↓ تحشّبهُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also 1, near the end.
12
اخشوشب He [a man or a camel (see
خَشِبٌ)] was, or became, tall, and gross, rude, or
coarse, with bones uncovered by flesh, and hard,
or hardy. (K.) He (an ostrich) was, or became,
rough, or coarse. (S.) ―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  He (a man) became
hard, or hardy, and rough, or coarse, in his
religion, clothing, food, and in all respects. (TA.)
(assumed tropical:)  He employed himself in work, and in walking
barefoot, in order that his body might become
thick, gross, or coarse. (S, TA.) And اخشوشب
فِى عَيْشِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He endured with patience a life of
hardship, or difficulty: or he subjected himself to
a life of hardship, or difficulty, in order to render
himself the more able to bear it. (K, TA.)
اِخْشَوْشِبُوا is thus used in a trad. of 'Omar: (S,
TA:) or, as some relate it, the word is [اجشوشبوا,]
with ج; or, accord. to some, اخشوشنوا, with خ
and ن. (TA.)
رَجُلٌ قِشْبٌ خِشْبٌ A man in whom is no good:
(S, K:) or with whom is no good: (TA:) [in
some copies of the K, خِشْبٌ وَ قِشْبٌ; but this, as
is said in the TA, is incorrect:] خِشْبٌ being an
imitative sequent to قِشْبٌ. (S, TA.)
خَشَبٌ [Wood, such as is used in carpentry and
the like; timber;] thick wood: (A, K:) [a coll.
gen. n.:] n. un. خَشَبَةٌ [signifying a piece of wood
or timber]: (Msb:) the pl. of the latter, (S,
Msb, *) or of the former, (K,) is خَشَبٌ, (S, K,
[i. e., accord. to the K, the pl. is the same as the
sing., but properly speaking, as said above, this
is a coll. gen. n.,]) and خُشُبٌ and خُشْبٌ (S,
Msb, K) and خُشْبَانٌ, (S, K,) [which last is agreeable with analogy as pl. of خَشَبٌ,] or خُشْبَانٌ is pl.
of خُشْبٌ, and خُشْبٌ is pl. of خَشَبَةٌ. (JK.) The
hypocrites are described in a trad. as خُشُبٌ بِاللَّيْلِ
صُخُبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ Like timbers, or pieces of wood, in
the night; [clamorous in the day;] meaning that
they pass the night in sleep, without prayer.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  مَالٌ خَشَبٌ (assumed tropical:)  Cattle that are lean, or
emaciated, syn. هَزْلَى, (K,) in consequence of their
feeding upon dry herbage. (TA.) [And it seems
that ↓ خَشَبٌ signifies the same: for I find in the
TA, and in a copy of the A which I believe to
have been used by the author of the TA, mentioned as tropical, مَالٌ خَشَبٌ وَحَطِبٌ جَزْلٌ, app.
meaning that مَالٌ خَشِبٌ and حَطِبٌ signify جَزْلٌ;
but جَزْلٌ, I think, is here evidently a mistranscription for هَزْلَى; as حَطِبٌ is explained in the
S and K as signifying “ very lean or meagre. ”]
خَشِبٌ Rough, or coarse; as also ↓ أَخْشَبُخَشِيبٌ:
(K:) the former applied in this sense to a male
ostrich: (S:) and both signify anything gross,
or big, and rough, or coarse; (A 'Obeyd, S;) as
also ↓ خَشِيبٌ: (TA:) and the first, (K,) applied
to a man and to a camel, (TA,) tall, and gross,
rude, or coarse, with bones uncovered by flesh,
and hard, or hardy, and strong; (K, * TA;) as
also ↓ خَشِيبٌ and ↓ خَشِيبِىٌّ: (K:) or these three
signify, or signify also, dry, or rigid, or tough:
(Kr, ISd:) and خَشِبٌ, a man hard, or hardy,
strong, and vigorous, in body: (A, TA:) and the
same, (JK,) or ↓ خَشِيبٌ, (TA,) a man whose
bones are uncovered by flesh, and whose sinews
are apparent; (JK, TA;) hard, or hardy, and
strong: (JK:) and the last, a gross, big, or
coarse, camel: (S, TA:) a camel gross, coarse,
or rude, in make, and ugly: (TA:) and a horse
thick, or big, in the bones. (Ham p. 207.) See
also خَشَبٌ. And see أَخْشَبُ, in two places. ―
-b2-
Also (assumed tropical:)  Life in which one is not dainty, nice, or
scrupulous. (K.)
خَشْبَةٌ The first filing of a sword, before the
polishing. (TA.)
خُشْبَانٌ: see أَخْشَبُ.
خَشَابٌ: see أَخْشَبُ.
خُشَابٌ, from the Persian خُوشْ آبْ, [The beverage properly called in Arabic] نَبِيذ. (TA.)
خَشِيبٌ and ↓ مَخْشُوبٌ Mixed. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
the former, (K,) or both, (TA,) Picked out,
chosen, or selected: (K, TA:) both words thus
having two contr. significations. (TA.)
-A2-  Also
the former (S, K) and latter, (K,) A sword
polished: (S, K: *) this is [said to be] the prevailing signification: (TA:) or both signify a
sharpened sword. (JK, TA.) ―
-b2-  And the former,
(As, S, K,) or both, (JK, A,) A sword of which
the forging is commenced; thus [again] having
two contr. significations: (S:) or forged, (K, *
TA,) or fashioned with the file, but not yet
polished: (As, TA:) or newly made: (TA:) or
imperfectly, not thoroughly, or not well, wrought;
(JK, A;) and thus both words applied to an arrow:
(A:) or the former, (S, K,) or both, (TA,) applied
to an arrow, (S, K,) and to a bow, (K,) shaped out
(S, K) [in a rough manner,] by the first operation, (S, TA,) not yet perfected, or made smooth,
or even: (TA:) pl. of the former (accord. to the
TA as applied to a bow [but I see no reason for
this restriction]) خُشُبٌ and خَشَائِبُ. (K.)
لَمْ يُنَقَّحْ ↓ مَخْشُوبٌ [Rough hewn, not yet
trimmed,] is a prov., mentioned by Meyd and Z.
(MF, TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence,] شِعْرٌ خَشِيبٌ and ↓ مَخْشُوبٌ

came to him, as it came, unpolished, and unstudied]. (A, TA.) ―
-b4-  See also خَشِيبٌ voce خَشِبٌ,
in three places. ―
-b5-  It also signifies Bad, corrupt,
or vile. (K.)
خَشِيبَةٌ The natural quality [of the metal] of a
sword, (Skr on the verse here following, S, TA,)
before the making thereof is completed: (Skr:)
or its blade, or iron: (A:) or its edge: or its
polish. (JK.) Sakhr says,
وَصَارِمٌ أُخْلِصَتْ خَشِيبَتُهُ
أَبْيَضُ مَهْوٌ فِى مَتْنِهِ زُبَدُ
And a sharp sword of which the natural quality
[of the metal] before the completion of the making
thereof has been refined, [white, or a sword,] thin
in the two edges or sides, having [in its broad
side] diversified marks. (Skr.)
خَشِيبِىٌّ: see خَشِبٌ.
خَشَّابٌ: see what next follows.
خَشَّابَةٌ [a coll. gen. n., of which the n. un. is
↓ خَشَّابٌ,] Sellers of خَشَب [i. e. wood, or timber].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Fighters with staves.
-A2-  Accord. to ElHejeree, خشابة [so in the TA, without any syll.
sign,] signifies A slender [implement of the kind
called] مطرق [i. e. مِطْرَق, q. v.,] which the polisher,
when he has finished the polishing of a sword,
passes over it, in consequence of which the scabbard
does not alter its state. (TA.)
خَاشِبٌ: see مُخْتَشِبٌ.
أَخْشَبُ: see خَشِبٌ. Also A great mountain:
(A:) or a rugged, or rough, and great mountain; (S, K;) and so ↓ جَبَلٌ خَشِبٌ: or such as
is not to be ascended: (TA:) an elevated place,
rugged, with rough stones: (JK:) a tract of the
kind termed قُفّ, rugged and stony: (TA:) pl.
أَخَاشِبُ, (A, TA,) because the quality of a subst.
is predominant in it: and the fem. خَشْبَآءُ is also
sometimes used in the same sense; or as syn.
with غَيْضَةٌ [i. e. a thicket, &c.]; but the former
meaning is better known: and this [likewise] is
thought to be rather a subst. than an epithet,
because of the pl., mentioned above: (TA:) and
↓ خُشْبَانٌ [also seems to be a pl. of أَخْشَبُ, or of
خَشِبٌ; for it is said that it] signifies rugged, or
rough, mountains, neither great nor small: (K:)
and rugged ground. (TA in art. ذنب.) خَشْبَآءُ

TA.) And أَكَمَةٌ خَشْبَآءُ (S, TA) A hill of which

forehead. (TA.)

-b2-  It is
applied to a horse, by El-Aashà; (S, TA;) meaning Of mixed pedigree: (A 'Obeyd, TA:) or not
