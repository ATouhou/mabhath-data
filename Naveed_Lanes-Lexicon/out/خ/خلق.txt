خلق1
خَلْقٌ signifies The act of measuring; or determining the measure, proportion, or the like, of
a thing; and the making a thing by measure, or
according to the measure of another thing; or
proportioning a thing to another thing; syn.
تَقْدِيرٌ: (S, Msb, K, TA, and Bd in ii. 19:) this
is the primary meaning. (Msb, TA, and Bd ubi
suprà.) You say, خَلَقَ الأَدِيمِ, (S, Msb, K,)
aor.
خَلُقَ, (S, TA,) inf. n. خَلْقٌ (JK, S, Msb, K)
and خَلْقَةٌ, (K,) He measured, or proportioned,
(قَدَّرَ,) the hide, and sewed it: (K:) or he measured, or proportioned, (قدّر,) the hide, (JK, S,
Msb, K,) لِمَا يُرِيدُ [for, or to, that which he desired to make of it], (JK, * TA,) or لِلسِّقَآءِ [for,
or to, the skin for water or milk that he desired
to make], (Msb,) before cutting it; (S, K, TA;)
he measured it (قَاسَهُ) to cut from it a water-bag,
or a water-skin, or a boot: (TA:) and in like
manner, خَلَقَ النِّطَعَ he measured, &c., the نطع
[q. v.]: when one cuts it, one says, فَرَاهُ. (K.)
And خَلَقَ النَّعْلَ He determined the measure of
the sandal, or proportioned it; (قَدَّرَهَا;) and
made it by measure. (Ksh and Bd in ii. 19.)
Hence the saying of Zuheyr, (S,) praising Herim
Ibn-Sinán, (TA,)
وَلَأَنْتَ تَفْرِى مَا خَلَقْتَ وَبَعْ(??)
(??)ضُ القَوْمِ يَخْلُقُ ثُمَّ لَا يَفْرِى
[(assumed tropical:)  And thou indeed cuttest what thou hast measured; but some of the people measure, then will
not cut]: (S, TA:) i. e., when thou determinest
upon a thing thou executest it; but others determine upon that which they do not execute. (TA.)
And El-Hajjáj said, مَا خَلَقْتُ إِلَّا قَرَيْتُ وَعَدْتُ
إِلَّا وَفَيْتُ [(assumed tropical:)  I have not measured unless I have
afterwards cut, and I have not promised unless
I have afterwards performed]. (S.) أَخْلُقُ لَكُمْ
مِنَ الطِّينِ كَهَيْئَةِ الطَّيْرِ, in the Kur iii. 43, means
I will form for you, (Jel,) or I will make according to its proper measure (أُقَدِّرُ) for you,
(Ksh, Bd,) and will form, (Bd,) of clay, a thing like
the form of the bird, or of birds. (Ksh, Bd, Jel.)
―
-b2-  [Hence,] it signifies also The bringing a thing
into existence according to a certain measure, or
proportion, and so as to make it equal [to another
thing], or uniform [therewith]: (Ksh and Bd in
ii. 19:) or the originating, or producing, [a
thing] after a pattern, or model, which one has
devised, not after the similitude of anything preexisting: this is another meaning which it has in
the [classical] language of the Arabs. (TA.) As
the act of God, it signifies The originating, or
bringing into being or existence, anything, not
after the similitude of anything pre-existing:
(TA:) [and the creating a thing; and thus it is
generally best rendered; as meaning the bringing
into existence from a state of non-existence: for]
خَلَقَ اللّٰهُ الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. خَلْقٌ, means God brought
the thing into existence (Mgh, * TA) after it had
not been: (TA:) [or خَلْقٌ, as the act of God,
signifies the creating out of nothing: for it is said
that] أُعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ, in the Kur ii. 19,
means [Serve ye your Lord] who brought you
into existence when ye were nothing. (Jel. [But
in other passages of the Kur (vi. 2 &c.) it is said
that God created (خَلَقَ) mankind of clay.])
Accord. to the A, خَلَقَ اللّٰهُ الخَلْقَ is a tropical
phrase, meaning (tropical:)  God brought into existence the
creation, or created beings, or mankind, according
to a predetermination (تَقْدِير) required by wisdom. (TA.) You say, هٰذِهِ خَلِيقَتُهُ الَّتِى خُلِقَ عَلَيْهَا
and خُلِقَهَا and الَّتِى خُلِقَ: see خُلُقٌ. (Lh.) ―
-b3-
[Hence, also,] خَلَقَ, (S, Msb, K, TA,) inf. n.
خَلْقٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He fabricated speech, or a saying
or sentence, &c.: (K, * TA:) (tropical:)  he forged (S,
Msb, K, TA) a saying, (Msb,) or a lie, or a
falsehood; (S, K, TA;) as also ↓ اختلق (S, Msb,
K) and ↓ تخلّق. (S, K.) The Arabs say, حَدَّثَنَا
فُلَانٌ بِأَحَادِيثِ الخَلْقِ (tropical:)  Such a one related to us
fictitious tales or stories, such as are deemed
pretty, or such as are told by night [for entertainment]. (TA.) And it is said in the Kur
[xxvi. 137], accord. to one reading, إِنْ هٰذَا إِلَّا
خَلْقُ الأَوَّلِينَ, meaning (tropical:)  This is nought but the
lying, and forging, of the ancients. (TA.) And
in the same [xxxviii. 6], ↓ إِنْ هٰذَا إِلَّا اخْتِلَاقٌ
(tropical:)  This is nought but forging, and lying. (TA.)
―
-b4-  خَلَقَهُ, (K,) inf. n. خَلْقٌ, (TA,) also signifies
He made it smooth; (K;) and so ↓ خلّقهُ;
namely, an arrow, (S,) [and any other thing; for]
of anything that has been made smooth one says,
خُلِّقَ: (TA:) he made it equable, or even;
namely, wood, or a stick; and so ↓ خلّقهُ, (K,)
inf. n. تَخْلِيقٌ. (TA.)
-A2-  خَلُقَتْ, inf. n. خَلَاقَةٌ,
said of a woman, (JK, K,) She had [a goodly]
body and make: (JK:) or she was, or became,
goodly in make, or well made. (K. [In the CK,

crack or fracture.] ―

service [so that it lost its grace, or was disgraced,]

(see خَلِيقٌ) He was, or became, adapted, disposed, &c., for that]; as though he were one of
those in whom that was reckoned to be, and in
whom the symptoms, signs, or tokens, thereof

TA) according to their natures, or moral characters or qualities; (TA;) or with good nature,
or moral character or qualities: (K:) or خالقهم
بِخُلُقٍ حَسَنٍ has this latter meaning. (TA.) One
says, خَالِصِ المُؤْمِنَ وَخَالِقِ الفَاجِرَ, (S,) or وخالق
الكَافِرَ, (TA,) [Act thou with reciprocal sincerity
towards the believer, and comport thyself with
the vitious, or the unbeliever, according to his
nature, &c. See also 3 in art. خلص, where
a similar saying is mentioned.]

hast used thy face for mean service [so that it has
lost its grace, or has become disgraced]: and in
like manner one says, أُخْلِقُ لَهُ دِيَبَاجَتِى, i. e.
وَجْهِى: and يُخْلِقُ دِيبَاجَتَيْهِ (tropical:)  He uses his face for

خُلُقِهِ) that which was contrary to his real intention; (Mbr, TA;) or that which was contrary
to what he had in his heart: the verb is similar
to تَصَنَّعَ and تَجَمَّلَ. (TA.)

K;) and تخلّقت به; (Msb;) He was, or became,

إِخْتَلَقَ see 1, latter half, in two places.
12
اخلولق, said of the back (مَتْن) of a horse,
It was, or became, smooth; (K;) [like خَلِقَ and

uniform, (JK, S, K, TA,) their sides becoming
conjoined; or, as some say, they became smooth;
(TA;) and, (K,) or as some say, (S, TA,) they

TA;) as though they were rendered smooth: or
they became collected together after separation,

You say رَجُلٌ تَامُّ الخَلْقِ [A man complete, or
perfect, in respect of make, or proportion, &c.].
(S, K. * [See also خِلْقَةٌ.]) [In this and similar
instances,] الخَلْق signifies The fashion of the
outer man, and its [peculiar] qualities and attributes; like as الخُلُقُ signifies “ the fashion of
the inner man,” &c. (TA.) ―
-b2-  الخَلْقُ is also used
in the sense of ↓ المَخْلُوقُ [meaning What is
created; the creature]: (TA, and Bd in xxiii. 17,
&c.:) [and, collectively, the creation; as meaning
the beings, or things, that are created;] all created
things: (Bd ubi suprà, &c.:) and [particularly]
mankind; as also ↓ الخلِيقَةُ: (S, * K:) and mankind and the jinn, or genii, and others: (Jel in
lv. 9, &c.:) and ↓ الخلِيقَةُ and [its pl.] خَلَائِقُ
signify the same: you say, هُمْ خَلِيقَةُ اللّٰهِ and
also هُمْ خَلقُ اللّٰهِ [They are the creatures of God]:
الخَلْقُ being originally an inf. n.: (S, TA:) and
Lh mentions [an instance of its having a pl., in]
the saying, لَا وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الخُلُوقَ مَا فَعَلْتُ كَذَا,
meaning [No, by Him who created] all creatures,
[I did not such a thing.] (TA.) In the saying,
فَلَيُغَيِّرُنَّ خَلْقَ اللّٰهِ, in the Kur [iv. 118, lit. And
they shall alter the creature of God], some say
that castration is meant: (TA: [and Bd includes,
with this, other unnatural actions:]) or the meaning is, the religion of God; (Bd, Jel, TA;)
accord. to El-Hasan and Mujáhid. (TA.) And
لَا تَبْدِيلَ لِخَلْقِ اللّٰهِ, in the Kur [xxx. 29], means,
accord. to Katádeh, [There shall be no changing,
or altering,] of the religion of God. (TA.) ―
-b3-
خَلْقٌ also signifies Anything made smooth. (TA.)
[See also مُخَلَّقٌ.]
خُلْقٌ: see خُلُقٌ, in four places.
خَلَقُ inf. n. of خَلِقَ: as such, signifying The
being smooth [&c.]. (JK, S. *) [As such also,]
in a rock, Freedom from crack or fracture. (S,
K.) ―
-b2-  [And, as such,] The being old, and worn
out. (K.) ―
-b3-  [Hence, used as an epithet,] Old,
and worn out: (S, Msb, K:) [and as an epithet
in which the quality of a subst. is predominant;
meaning an old and worn-out garment or piece of
cloth:] pl. خُلْقَانٌ (S, K) and أَخْلَاقٌ. (S, * K, *
TA.) And [as an epithet] it is masc. and fem.;
(S, K;) because it is originally an inf. n., the
inf. n. of أَخْلَقُ meaning “ smooth,” (S,) [or
rather of خَلِقَ meaning “ it was, or became, old,
and worn out; ” although it has pls.; and] IB
mentions an instance of its dual, خَلَقَانِ: (TA:)
Ks says, We have not heard them say, خَلَقَةٌ in
any instance: (Lh, TA:) Fr says that it is without ة [as a fem. epithet] because it was originally
used as a prefixed noun; for one said, أَعْطِنِى
خَلَقَ جُبَّتِكَ and خَلَقَ عِمَامَتِكَ [lit. meaning Give
thou to me what is old, and worn out, of thy
جبّة and of thy turban]; but Ez-Zejjájee says
that this is nought. (TA.) You say ثَوْبٌ خَلَقٌ
[An old and worn-out garment or piece of cloth],
and مِلْحَفَةٌ خَلَقٌ [an old and worn-out outer
wrapping garment]: (S:) also رُمَّةٌ خَلَقٌ [an old
and worn-out piece of rope]: and دَارٌ خَلَقٌ [an
old and decayed house]: and جِسْمٌ خَلَقٌ [an old
and wasted body]. (TA.) One says also ثَوْبٌ
أَخْلَاقٌ, meaning A garment, or piece of cloth,
altogether, or wholly, old and worn out; (Fr, S,
K;) every portion of it being خَلَق; (Fr;) like
as they said بُرْمَةٌ أَعْشَارٌ &c.: (S:) and in like
manner, مُلَآءَةٌ أَخْلَاقٌ. (IAar.) And Ks mentions
the saying, أَصْبَحَتْ ثِيَابُهُمْ خُلْقَانًا وَ خَلَقُهُمْ جُدُدًا
[Their garments became old, and worn out; and
their old and worn-out garments became replaced
by new]; with the sing. [in the latter clause] in
the place of the pl. خُلْقَان: (TA:) or جُدُدًا may
be here put for جَدِيدًا. (L in art. جد.) In the
phrase ↓ مِلْحَفَةٌ خُلَيْقٌ [An outer wrapping garment
that is a little, or somewhat, old, and worn out],
the dim. is without ة because it is [the dim. of]
an epithet [applied without ة to a fem. n.], and ة
is not affixed to the dims. of epithets [of this
kind]: it is like نُصَيُفٌ dim. of نَصَفٌ an epithet
applied to a woman. (S, K. * [See Lumsden's
Arab. Gram. p. 623: but some of the grammarians consider these instances as anomalous.])
―
-b4-  بَاعَهُ بِيعَةَ الخَلَقِ, and بَيْعَ ذِى الخَلَقِ, the
latter as used by a poet, [lit. He bought it, or sold
it, (app. the former,) as one buys, or sells, the old
and worn-out garment, like as we say “ dogcheap,” and “ cheap as dirt ”], are phrases mentioned, but not explained, by IAar, who cites the
following saying:
أَبْلِغْ فَزَارَةَ أَنِّى قَدْ شَرَيْتُ لَهَا
مَجْدَ الحَيَاةِ بِسَيْفِى بَيْعَ ذِى الخَلَقِ
[app. meaning Tell thou Fezárah that I have
purchased for them life-long glory (lit. the glory
of life), with my sword, as cheaply, i. e as easily,
as one purchases the old and worn-out garment].
(TA.) ―
-b5-  سَحَابَةٌ خَلَقَةٌ: see the next paragraph.
خَلِقٌ [part. n. of خَلِقَ]. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] سحَابَةٌ
خَلِقَةٌ A cloud in which is a sign, or trace, of
rain; as also ↓ خَلِيقَةٌ: (S, K:) or a cloud giving
hope of rain; as also ↓ خَلْقَآءُ; (JK;) both are
said by IAar to signify the same: (TA:) and
↓ خَلَقَةٌ [alone, as a subst., or probably سَحَابَةٌ
خَلَقَةٌ,] a cloud that is equable, or uniform,
giving hope of rain. (Aboo-Sa'eed, K.)
خُلُقٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ خُلْقٌ (S, K) A nature;
or a natural, a native, or an innate, disposition
or temper or the like; syn. سَجِيَّةٌ, (S, Msb, K,
TA,) and طَبْعٌ; (K, TA;) of which one is
created: (TA:) and ↓ خِلْقَةٌ signifies [the same;
i. e.] the فِطْرَةٌ [or nature, &c.,] (S, Msb, K, TA)
of which a man is created; (TA;) like [خُلُقٌ
and] ↓ خُلْقٌ: (K, TA: [in the CK, erroneously,
خَلْق:]) and ↓ خَلِيقَةٌ [also] signifies [the same;
i. e.] the طَبِيعَة [or nature, &c.,] (S, K, TA)
with which a man is created: (TA:) the proper
signification of خُلُقٌ is [the moral character; or]
the fashion of the inner man; i. e. his mind, or
soul, and its peculiar qualities and attributes;
like as خَلْقٌ signifies the “ fashion of the outer
man, and its [peculiar] qualities and attributes: ”
it signifies also custom or habit [as being a second
nature]: (TA:) and, as also ↓ خُلْقٌ, [which is
merely a contraction thereof, and therefore identical with it in all its senses,] manliness; syn.
مُرُوْءَةٌ: and religion: (IAar, K:) the pl. is أَخْلَاقٌ
only: (TA:) [this is often used as signifying
morals: and ethics:] and the pl. of ↓ خَلِيقَةٌ in
the sense explained above [said in Har p. 193
to be that of خُلُقٌ] is خَلَائِقٌ. (S.) It is said in a
trad., لَيْسَ شَىْءٌ فِى المِيزَانِ أَثْقَلَ مِنْ حُسْنِ الخُلُقِ
[Nothing is heavier in the balance in which good
and evil will be weighed than goodness of the
moral character, &c.] (TA.) And one says,
عَلَيْهَا ↓ الَّتِى خُلِقَ ↓ هٰذِهِ خَلِيقَتُهُ and ↓ خُلِقَهَا and
↓ الَّتِى خُلِقَ This is his nature, &c., of which he
was created. (Lh.) And ↓ إِنَّهُ لَكَرِيمُ الخَلِيقَةِ
Verily he is generous in respect of nature, &c.
(AZ.) And صَارَ ذٰلِكَ لَهُ خُلُقًا That became to him
[a second nature, a habit, or] a thing to which he
was habituated. (TA.) It is said in the Kur
[xxvi. 137], إِنْ هٰذَا إِلَّا خُلُقُ الأَوَّلِينَ This is nought
but a custom of the ancients. (TA.) And in the
same [lxviii. 4], وَ إِنَّكَ لَعَلَى خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ And
verily thou art of a great religion. (Jel, TA.)
And in a trad. of 'Áïsheh, كَانَ خُلُقُهُ القَرْآنَ,
meaning That whereto he clung was the Kur-án,
with its rules of discipline and its command and
its prohibitions, and the excellences and beauties
and gracious things comprised in it. (TA.) ―
-b2-
نَوْمَةُ الخُلقِ [i. e. الخُلُقِ or ↓ الخُلْقِ] The sleep of
midday, which was prescribed by the Prophet.

خُلْقَةٌ Smoothness; (K, TA;) as also ↓ خُلُوقَةٌ
and ↓ خَلَاقَةٌ: (K:) but the second of these three,
correctly speaking, [as also the third, accord. to
analogy, and perhaps the first also,] is an inf. n.
of خَلُقَ. (TA.)
خِلْقَةٌ [primarily signifies A mode, or manner,
of خَلْق, generally as meaning creation; a particular make: and hence,] constitution; syn.
تَرْكِيبٌ: (Mgh:) [and particularly the natural
constitution of an animated being, as created in
the womb of the mother; also termed فِطْرَةٌ:] see
also خُلُقٌ. You say رَجُلٌ حَسَنُ الخِلْقَةِ [A man
goodly, or beautiful, in respect of make]. (A,
TA.) فِى مَسْلَكٍ هُوَ خِلْقَةٌ means فِى طَرِيقٍ
أَصْلِىٍّ ↓ خِلْقِىٍّ [In a way, or road, that is
