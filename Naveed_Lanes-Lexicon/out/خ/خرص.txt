خرص1
خَرَصَ النَّخْلَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb,) aor.
خَرُصَ (A,
Msb) [and
خَرِصَ, as appears from what follows,]
inf. n. خَرْصٌ, (S, A Mgh, Msb,) [and خِرْصٌ is
also allowable, (see what follows,)] He computed
by conjecture the quantity of the fruit upon the
palm-trees: (A, Mgh, Msb:) or he computed by
conjecture the quantity that was upon the palmtrees of fresh ripe dates that would be dried dates.
(S.) خَرْصٌ signifies The computing quantity by
conjecture; (A, K, TA;) conjecturing; opining:
or forming an opinion of a thing of which one is
not certain: you say, خَرَصَ العَدَدَ, aor.
خَرُصَ and
خَرِصَ,
inf. n. خَرْصٌ and خِرْصٌ, the latter said by ISh to
be like عِلْمٌ as inf. n. of عَلِمَ, and said by Az to
be allowable because a simple subst. is put in the
place of an inf. n., He computed by conjecture the
number: and hence خَرْصُ النَّخْلِ, and التَّمْرِ, [the
computing by conjecture the quantity of fruit
upon palm-trees, and of dates,] because خَرْصٌ is
the computing quantity by opinion, not by knowledge. (TA.) ―
-b2-  خَرْصٌ also signifies Any speaking by opinion, or conjecture. (K, * TA.) You
say, خَرَصَ فِيهِ He spoke of him, or it, by opinion,
or conjecture. (TK.) ―

خَرَصَ,
(K,) inf. n. خَرَصٌ, (S, A,) He (a man) was
