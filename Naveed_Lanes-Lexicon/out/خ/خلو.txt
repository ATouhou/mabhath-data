خلو1
خَلَا, (S, Msb, K,) aor. يَخْلُو, (S, Msb,)
inf. n. خُلُوٌّ, (S, Msb, K,) or خَلَآءٌ, (Msb,) or
both, (K,) said of a place, (K,) of a place of
alighting or abode, (Msb,) and of a thing, (S,
TA,) It was, or became, empty, vacant, void,
devoid, destitute, or unoccupied; (K, TA;) had
none, and nothing, in it; (TA;) as also ↓ اخلى,
(Msb, K,) and ↓ استخلى, (K.) [خَلَا المَكَانُ مِنَ
النَّاسُ وَ المَآءِ وَالكَلَأ means The place was, or
became, devoid, or destitute, of human beings and
water and herbage or pasturage; without human
beings &c.] Of a place of alighting or abode, you
say, خَلَا مِنْ أَهْلِهِ and ↓ اخلى [It was, or became,
devoid, or destitute, of its occupants]. (Msb.)
And of a vessel, خَلَا مِمَّا فِيهِ It was, or became,
empty of what was in it. (Mgh.) And خَلَوْتُ
عَنِ الطَّعَامِ (S) I became empty, in the belly, of
food; (PS;) and عَنْهُ ↓ أَخْلَيْتُ signifies the
same. (S.) And خَلَا مِن العَيْبِ, (Msb,) or عَنِ
الأَمْرِ, and مِنْهُ, (Kudot;,) inf. n. خُلُوٌّ, He was, or
became, free (Msb, K) from fault, (Msb,) or
from the thing, or affair: (K:) and, accord. to
IAar, خلا alone signifies he was, or became, free
from a fault, or the like, of which he was
accused, or suspected. (TA.) And خَلَتْ عَنْ مَانِعِ
النِّكَاحِ, inf. n. خُلُوٌّ, is said of a woman [as meaning She was, or became, free from any obstacle to
marriage]. (Msb.) Accord. to the K, خَلَا مَكَانُهُ
[lit. His place became vacant] means (tropical:)  he died:
but accord. to IAar, خَلَا alone has this signification [from the same verb signifying مَضَى. explained below]: and if you add مكانه, you say
خَلَّى, with teshdeed; which see below. (TA.)
You say also, خَلَا لَكَ الشَّىْءُ and ↓ اخلى, both
signifying the same, (AA, S, TA,) i. q. فَرَغَ [i. e.
The thing was, or became, vacant, or unoccupied,
for thee: (see an ex. of the former verb in a
saying of Tarafeh cited voce جَوٌّ:) and hence, the
thing was, or became, exclusively for thee].
(TA.) AA cites as an ex. the saying of Maan
Ibn-Ows,
أَعَاذِلُ هَلْ يَأْتِى القَبَائِلَ حَظُّهَا
لَنا المَوْتُ وَحْدَنَا ↓ مِنَ المَوْتِ أَمْ أَخْلَى
[O censurer, does their share of death come to the
tribes in common, or is death exclusively for us
alone?]. (S, TA.) See also the paragraph,
below, commencing with خَلَا as a word denoting
exception. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] خَلَا and ↓ اخلى, (S, K,)
said of a man, (TA,) or the same two verbs followed by بِنَفْسِهِ, said of a man, (Msb,) both
signify the same; (S;) He was, or became,
[without any companion, i. e.] alone, by himself;
(Msb;) or he became (وَقَعَ [q. v.]) in a vacant
place, in which he was not pressed against, or
straitened. (K.) And خَلَا بِهِ, (S, Msb, K,) and
إِلَيْهِ, (S, K,) and مَعَهُ, (K,) inf. n. خَلْوَةٌ (S, Msb,
K) and خَلَآءٌ (S, K) and خَلْوٌ, (K, TA,) or خُلُوٌّ,
(CK,) or the first of these, i. e. خَلْوَةٌ, is a simple
subst., and the second and third are the inf. ns.;
(TA;) and به ↓ اخلى, (Lh, K,) and ↓ اخلاهُ, (S,
K,) and بِهِ ↓ استخلى; (K; [the last omitted in
the CK;]) He was, or became, alone with him;
(Msb;) he was, or became, in company with him,
or he met him, or had a meeting or an interview
with him, in a vacant place, or a place unoccupied [by others, i. e., in a private place]. (S, K.)
In the saying in the Kur [ii. 13], وَإِذَا خَلَوْا إِلَى
شَيَاطِينِهِمْ, it is said that إِلَى is used in the sense
of مَعَ, [so that the meaning is And when they are
alone with their devils,] as in that other saying in
the Kur [iii. 45 and lxi. 14], مَنْ أَنْصَارِى إِلَى اللّٰهُ.
(S.) A man says to another man, اُخْلُ مَعِى حَتَّى
أُكَلِّمَكَ, i. e. Be [or come] thou alone with me
[that I may speak to thee in private]. (TA.)
And one says, خَلَا بِزَوْجَتِهِ, inf. n. خَلْوَةٌ, [but see
what is said of this noun above,] He was, or became, alone with his wife: but [properly speaking,
according to the law,] the term خَلْوَةٌ [or خَلْوَةٌ
صَحِيحَةٌ, in this case,] is not used unless it be with
the enjoyment of المُفَاخَذَة, [see 3 in art. فخذ,]
and then it has an effect upon the circumstances
of the marriage [by its rendering obligatory the
payment of the dowry, though consummation has
not taken place]: if with consummation, the act
is termed دُخُولٌ. (Msb.) You say also, ↓ أَخْلِ
أَمْرَكَ and بِأَمْرِكَ Be thou alone in thine affair,
with none to take part with thee in it; confine
thyself to it exclusively of other things. (TA.
[See also 5.]) And إِلَيْكَ ↓ أَخْلِ Keep thou to thine
affair, and be alone in it, with none to take part
with thee therein. (JK.) And البُكَآءُ ↓ استخلى
[app. for بِالبُكَآءِ] He was, or became, alone in
weeping, with none to participate with him in it.
(TA.) [And خَلَا لِلْأَمْرِ: see 5.] And خَلَاعَلَى
بَعْضِ الطَّعَامِ He restricted himself to a portion
of the food. (K.) Temeem say, خَلَا فُلَانٌ عَلَى
اللَّبَنِ وَ اللَّحْمِ (JK, * TA) i. e. Such a one fed
upon milk and flesh-meat alone; (JK;) or such
a one ate not, nor mixed, anything with milk and
flesh-meat: and Kináneh and Keys say ↓ أَخْلَى.
(Lh, JK, * TA.) [And it seems to be indicated
in the T that خَلَوْا signifies They selected a she-camel for a خَلِيَّة, q. v.: or i. q. تَخَلَّوْا بِخَلَيِّةٍ:
see 5.] ―
-b3-  خَلَا also ssignifies He devoted himself
to religious services or exercises [app. in solitude,
or seclusion, or in a خَلْوَة; or because one generally does so in solitude; or because the doing so
involves abstraction from other affairs]. (TA.
[See also 5; and see مُسْتَخْلٍ.]) ―
-b4-  And خَلَا بِهِ
[sometimes] signifies (tropical:)  He mocked at, scoffed at,
laughed at, derided, or ridiculed, him: (Lh, S,
Z, K, TA:) said by Az to be strange, and not
known by him or any other authority than that
of Lh: (TA:) from the saying, خَلَا فُلَانٌ بِعِرْضِ
فُلَانٍ يَعْبَثُ بِهِ [Such a one occupied himself alone
with the honour, or reputation, of such a one,
making sport with it]. (Ksh in ii. 13.) And
i. q. خَادَعَهُ (tropical:)  [He deceived, deluded, beguiled,
circumvented, or outwitted, him; &c.: or he
strove to do so]: (TA:) as also ↓ خالاهُ, (JK, and
K in art. خلى,) inf. n. مُخَالَاةٌ. (JK.) ―
-b5-  And
خَلَا عَلَيْهِ He relied upon him; [as though he
betook himself to him alone;] syn. اِعْتَمَدَ. (TA.)
―
-b6-  And خَلَا, (JK, K,) inf. n. خُلُوٌّ, (TA,) or
خَلَآءٌ, (JK,) said of a man (JK) and of a thing,
(JK, TA,) He, or it, went, went away, or passed
away. (JK, K.) Hence, (TA,) وَ إِنْ مِنْ أُمَّةٍإِلَّا
خَلَا فِيهَا نَذِيرٌ, in the Kur [xxxv. 22], means
[And there is not any people but a warner] hath
gone, and hath been sent, among them. (S, TA.)
[Hence also خَلَا explained above as meaning He
died.] And خَلَا مِنْهَا [an elliptical phrase] She
became old; the greater part of her life passed.
(TA from a trad.) And خَلَاكَ ذَمٌّ [for خَلَا عَنْكَ
ذَمٌّ] Blame passed away from thee; or may blame
pass away from thee. (Ksh and Bd in ii. 13.)
You say, اِفْعَلْ كَذَا وَ خَلَاكَ ذَمٌّ Do thou such a
thing, and thou wilt have an excuse; [i. e.] blame
will fall from thee. (S. [See art. ذم.]) And
خَلَاهُ الحُزْنُ Grief passed away from him, and
quitted him. (Har p. 590, from the Tekmileh.)
―
-b7-  خَلَا عَنِ الشَّىْءِ: see 2.
-A2-  خَلَا [or خَلَى, probably belonging to art. خلى, though mentioned
in the present art.,] He ate what was good, sweet,
or pleasant. (TA.)
2
خَلَّى, inf. n. تَخْلِيَةٌ, [He left a place, &c.,
empty, vacant, void, devoid, destitute, or unoccupied.] Hence, خلّى مَكَانَهُ [He left his place
vacant;] meaning (tropical:)  he died: (TA, and so in Ham
p. 478:) a meaning assigned in the K to ↓ خَلَا
مَكَانُهُ, and by IAar to خَلَا alone, without tesh-deed; but when مكانه is added, it is with teshdeed.
(TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  He went his way. (Ham p. 379.)
And خلّى سَبِيلَهُ [He left his way free, or open,
to him]. (S, TA.) And خلّى بَيْنَهُمَا [He left the
way, or space, free between them two; meaning
he left them two free, each to do to the other as
he pleased]. (TA.) [And خلّى بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ كَذَا
He left him free access to such a thing.] And
خلّى بَيْنَهُ وَ بَيْنَ نَفْسِهِ He left him, or it, alone;
syn. أَهْمَلَهُ. (S and O and K in art. همل.) [And
خلّاهُ وَفُلَانًا He left him to do as he pleased with
such a one.] And خلّى الأَمْرَ He left, left alone,
or let alone, the thing, or affair; as also ↓ تخلّى
مِنْهُ and عَنْهُ; and ↓ خالاهُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. خِلَآءٌ.
(TA.) For تَخْلِيَةٌ signifies The leaving, and
making a thing to be alone. (Har p. 123.)
[خلّاهُ and خلّى عَنْهُ both signify He left, or left
alone, it, or him.] It is said in a trad., خلّى عَنْهُمْ
أَرْبَعِينَ عَامًا He (God) left them, or left them
alone, and turned from them, forty years. (TA.)
[And خلّاهُ لِكَذَا He made him, or left him, vacant, unoccupied, unemployed, or at leisure, for
such a thing.] ―
-b2-  تَخْلِيَةٌ also signifies The act of
loosing; contr. of شَدٌّ. (IAar, K in art. ابض.)
[Hence,] خلّى عَنِ الشَّىْءِ, (JK, S, * TA,) in the
K ↓ خَلَا, without teshdeed, but this requires consideration, (TA,) He dismissed, loosed, let loose,
or let go, the thing. (JK, K, TA.) ―
-b3-  [And
hence خلّاهُ meaning He left it, permitted it, or
allowed it: see the pass. part. n., below.]
-A2-
خُلِّيَتْ, said of a she-camel such as is termed
خَلِيَّة; and hence, of a cooking-pot: see 1 in art.
خلى.
3
خالاهُ He left, forsook, relinquished, abandoned, deserted, or quitted, him, being left, &c.,
by him; namely, another man; syn. تَارَكَهُ; (S;)
inf. n. مُخَالَاةٌ, syn. with مُوَادَعَةٌ, (JK,) [and
خِلَآءٌ also: and he was, or became, distant, remote, far off, aloof, or apart, from him; for]
خِلَآءٌ is syn. with مُبَاعَدَةٌ and مُجَانَبَةٌ (TA in art.
خلأ) and فُرْقَةٌ. (TA in the present art.) And
خالى الأَمْرَ, inf. n. خِلَآءٌ: see 2. ―
-b2-  [Also He
went, or came, out, or forth, to him, in the field;
for] مُخَالَاةٌ is also syn. with مُبَارَزَةٌ. (Sh, TA.)
―
-b3-  Also, (Lth, JK, K,) inf. n. مُخَالَاةٌ, (Lth,
JK,) He wrestled with him, each endeavouring
to throw down the other; contended with him in
wrestling: (Lth, JK, K: mentioned in the K in
art. خلى:) because, when one does so, he is
alone with the other, so that neither of them seeks
aid from any other. (Az, TA.) And in like
manner the word مُخَالَاةٌ is used [app. as meaning
The act of contending with another, by oneself,]
in relation to any affair, or case. (Lth, JK, TA.
[See its act. part. n., below.]) ―
-b4-  See also 1, in
the latter part of the paragraph.

أَخْلَوَ see 1, in eleven places.
-A2-  اخلى المَكَانَ,
(S, K,) or المَنْزِلَ, (Msb,) He made the place,
(K,) or the place of alighting or abode, (Msb,)
empty, vacant, void, devoid, destitute, or unoccupied: (Msb, K:) or it signifies, (S, K,) or
signifies also, (Msb,) he found it empty, &c. (S,
Msb, K.) One says in praying for another that
he may have a long life, لَا أَخْلَى اللّٰهُ مَكَانَكَ [May
God not make thy place vacant]. (TA.) ―
-b2-
اخلاهُ مَعَهُ [He made him, or found him, to be
alone with him]. (K.)
5
تخلّى He went forth into the field, or open
country, to satisfy a want of nature. (TA.)
And تخلّى فِى الخَلَآءِ He went forth into the
vacant tract, or into the privy, to satisfy a want
of nature: or he satisfied a want of nature
therein. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also He was, or became, or
made himself, vacant from occupation, or business; [unoccupied; unemployed; or at leisure;]
syn. تَفَرَّغَ: (S:) or so تخلّى مِنَ الشُّغْلِ. (K in
art. فرغ.) You say, تخلّى لِلْعِبَادَةِ He was, or
became, or made himself, vacant for, or he confined himself exclusively to, the service of God.
(TA.) [See also 1, in the latter part of the paragraph. In like manner, one says also, لِلْأَمْرِ ↓ خَلَا
He was, or became, or made himself, vacant for,
or he confined himself exclusively to, the affair.]
And تَخَلَّوْا بِخَلِيَّةٍ (S, K, TA) They confined
themselves exclusively to a she-camel, or to she-camels, such as they termed خلية, (K, TA,)
يَحْلُبُونَهَا [milking only her, or them]. (S, TA.)
And تخلّى خَلِيَّةً He took for himself a خليّة.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And تخلّى مِنَ الأَمْرِ and عَنْهُ: see 2.
―
-b4-  And تَخَلَّتِ الإِبِلُ بِلَا رَاعٍ [The camels were
left to themselves without a pastor]. (K in art.
سوع.)
10
إِسْتَخْلَوَ see 1, in three places. [And see also
مُسْتَخْلٍ.]
-A2-  استخلاهُ مَجْلِسَهُ He asked him to
leave his sitting-place vacant, or unoccupied, for
him. (S. [But found by me in only one copy of
that work.]) ―
-b2-  استخلى المَلِكَ He asked the
king to have a meeting, or an interview, with him
in a vacant place, or a place unoccupied [by
others, i. e., in a private place; he asked the
king to grant him a private meeting or interview]. (K.)
خَلَا as a word denoting exception, (S, Mughnee,
K,) when it governs a gen. case, (S, Mughnee,)
as when you say, جَاؤُونِى خَلَا زَيْدٍ [They came to
me, except Zeyd], is a particle, (S, Mughnee, K,)
accord. to some of the grammarians, like حَاشَى;
but accord. to some, a prefixed inf. n. (S.) ↓ It.
also governs an accus. case, as a verb: (S, Mughnee:) so that you say, جَاؤُونِى خَلَا زَيْدًا [meaning
as above]; the agent of خلا being implied, (S,
Mughnee, *) like that of حَاشَى [used as a verb]:
it is as though you said, خَلَا مَنْ جَآءَنِى مِنْ زَيْدٍ
[i. e. those who came to me were without Zeyd]:
(S:) or correctly, accord. to IB, خَلَا بَعْضُهُمْ زَيْدًا
[for مِنْ زَيْدٍ, like as you say, خَلَاكَ ذَمٌّ, for خَلَا
عَنْكَ ذَمٌّ]. (TA.) When you say مَا خَلَا, it is
followed only by an accus., because ما خلا is equivalent to an inf. n.; (S, Mughnee;) so that when
you say, جَاؤُونِى مَا خَلَا زَيْدًا [meaning as above],
it is as if you said, جَاؤُونِى خُلُوَّ زَيْدٍ [or خُلُوًّا
زَيْدًا], i. e. خُلُوَّهُمْ مِنْ زَيْدٍ, (S,) which two phrases
mean جَاؤُونِى خَالِينَ مِنْ زَيْدٍ [They came to me,
they being without Zeyd]: (S, K:) [for] accord.
to Seer, ماخلا occupies the place of a noun in the
accus. as a denotative of state: but some say,
as an adv. n. of time; so that, accord. to these,
مَا خَلَا زَيْدًا means وَقْتَ خُلُوِّهِمْ عَنْ زَيْدٍ [in the
time of their being without Zeyd]. (Mughnee.)
You say also, مَا أَرَدْتُ مَسَآءَتَكَ خَلَا أَنِّى وَعَظْتُكَ,
meaning [I desired not to displease thee,] but I
admonished thee (إِلَّا أَنِّى وَعَظْتُكَ). (JK, TA.)
خِلْوٌ, and its fem. (with ة), and dual: see خَالٍ,
in seven places.
خَلْوَةٌ said by some to be an inf. n.: [see خَلَا بِهِ
&c. in the first paragraph of this art.:] by others said
to be a simple subst.; (TA;) meaning Loneliness;
solitude; lonesomeness; solitariness; desolateness;
syn. وَحْشَةٌ. (S and K in art. وحش.) [Hence, app.,]
رَجُلٌ سَهْلُ الخَلْوَةِ [A man easy in private conference]. (Msb in art. سلس. [See also a phrase in
the latter part of the next paragraph.]) ―
-b2-
Also An empty, a vacant, a void, or an unoccupied, place. (KL. [See also خَلَآءٌ.]) [In the
present day, it is often applied to A closet to which
one retires for privacy; and particularly to a cell
for religious retirement: and is vulgarly pronounced خِلْوَة.] You say, اِجْتَمَعَ مَعَهُ فِى خَلْوَةٍ
(S) or اجتمع بِهِ فى خلوة (K) [He had a meeting,
or an interview, with him in a vacant place, or
a place unoccupied by others, i. e., in a private
place].
-A2-  Also Each of the two sharp sides or
edges of an arrow-head (AHn, JK, TA) or of a
spear-head: (AHn, TA:) both together are called
the خَلْوَتَانِ: (AHn, JK, TA.)
خَلَآءٌ is primarily an inf. n. (MF, TA. [See 1,
first sentence.]) ―
-b2-  [Then it is used as an epithet,
syn. with خَالٍ:] see خَالٍ, in five places. ―
-b3-  Then
it is used [as a subst.] in the sense of A vacant
place [in a general sense]: (MF, TA:) or a
place in which is nothing: (S, K:) [often applied
in the present day to any open tract of country
or desert:] and then, particularly, such as one
takes for the purpose of satisfying a want of
nature; (MF, TA;) i. q. مُتَوَضَّأٌ, (S, Msb, K,)
but not as meaning only a place for the performance of الوُضُوء, as might be imagined from this
explanation: pl. أَخْلِيَةٌ. (MF, TA.) It is said in
a prov., (S, Meyd,) خَلَاؤُكَ أَقْنَى لِحَيَائِكَ, (S,
Meyd, K,) [in Freytag's Arab. Prov., (i. 436,)
بِحَيَآيِكَ,] i. e. [Thy place of retirement is] most
preservative (أَلْزَمُ) [of thy sense of shame, or
modesty]; meaning it is most fit for thee to be
alone in thine abode; (S, * Meyd;) for he who
is so needs not to be careful for his shame, or
modesty: it is used in blaming the mixing with
others. (Meyd.) حُصِرَ عَلَيْهِ خَلَاؤُهُ [His place of
retirement for satisfying a want of nature was
straitened to him] is used as meaning he suffered
suppression of the feces, or constipation of the
bowels. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA in art. حصر.)
-A2-  إِنَّهُ
لَحْلُو الخَلَآءِ, (TA,) or [as written in a verse in
which it occurs in the TA in the present art., and
in art. خلى,] الخَلَا, (JK, TA,) [without ء, but
whether this be the right reading, or only required by poetic license, seems to be doubtful,]
is a phrase mentioned by Th, (TA,) meaning
Verily he is good in speech. (JK, TA. [If the
former reading be right, the meaning may be
similar to that of سَهْلُ الخَلْوَةِ, mentioned above:
if the latter only, or rather انّه لحلو الخَلَى, be
right, it probably belongs to art. خلىٍ, and is
tropical, from the herbage termed خَلى; and this
may also be the case if the former reading be
right.])
خَلِىٌّ; and its fem. خَلِيَّةٌ: see خَالٍ, in twelve
places. ―
-b2-  The fem. also signifies, applied to a
she-camel, (S, Msb,) Loosed from the cord, or
rope, with which her fore shank and her arm
have been bound together, (S, Msb, K,) and left
alone, or free, (S,) so that she pastures where she
will. (Msb.) Hence, (Msb,) it is used by way
of metonymy as meaning Divorced: (Lh, S,
Msb, K:) one says to a woman, أَنْتِ خَلِيَّةٌ Thou
art divorced; (Lh, S;) and thus a man used to
say in the Time of Ignorance: (TA:) and one
says, هِىَ خَلِيَّةٌ She is divorced: (Msb:) and a
woman is divorced thereby when divorce is meant.
(Lh, TA.) Applied to a woman, it signifies also
Free from any obstacle to marriage: pl. خَلِيَّاتٌ.
(Msb.) ―
-b3-  Also A she-camel that is made to
affect, with another she-camel, one young one, so
that both yield their milk to it, and to which the
people of a tent, or house, confine themselves exclusively of the other for the purpose of milking
her: (S:) or a she-camel that is chosen as the
one more abundant in milk, when one has brought
forth and her young one is drawn away (يُجَرُّ)
as soon as born, before she smells it, and the
young one of another, that has brought forth
before her, is brought near to her, and she affects
it; the other is left to suckle the young one, and
is termed بَسُوطٌ, pl. بسط [app. بُسْطٌ or بُسُطٌ]:
(Az, TA:) or a she-camel that is left, or left
alone, to be milked: (K:) or that affects a young
one [not her own], or is destitute of her young
one, (JK, M, K,) whether she incline to another's
young one or do not, or that is destitute of her
young one by death or slaughter, (M, TA,) and
whose milk one causes to flow by means of the
young one of another; but only by her affecting
a young one, and not suckling it: (M, K: *) or
that brings forth, when abundant in milk, and
has her young one drawn (يُجَرُّ) from beneath
her, and another put beneath her, and is then
left, or left alone, to be milked; (Lh, K;) this
being done because of her generous quality:
(Lh:) or a she-camel, or two she-camels, to
which the people of a tent, or house, confine themselves exclusively, for milking, when two or three
she-camels are made to affect one young one, and
to yield their milk to it; the young one [afterwards] sucking from one of them only: (K, *
TA:) or a she-camel that brings forth, and whose
young one is drawn away (يُجَرُّ) in order that
her milk may continue for their use, she being
made to yield her milk by means of the young one
of another, which is then withdrawn from her,
and she is milked: sometimes, also, they bring
together three and four خَلَايَا [pl. of خَلِيَّةٌ] to one
young camel: and the doing so is termed تَلَسُّنٌ:
(IAar, TA:) in this case they take as a خليّة
whichever of them they will. (ISh, TA.) [Applied to a she-camel in any of these senses, it
seems to be an epithet in which the quality of a
subst. is predominant; i. e., used without its
having نَاقَةٌ prefixed to it.]
-A2-  See also the paragraph next following, in two places.
خَلِيَّةٌ [as fem. of the epithet خَلِىٌّ: see the next
preceding paragraph, and the places there referred
to in its first sentence.
-A2-  As a subst. it signifies]
A great ship: (T, S, K:) or a ship that goes of
itself, without its being made to do so by the
sailor: (JK, K:) or one that is followed by a
small boat: (K:) the first held by Az to be the
