(JK, S, A, Mgh, K *) and خَوْرٌ, (JK,) He (a
bull) uttered his cry; [i. e. lowed, or bellowed;]
(Lth, JK, S, A, Mgh, K;) this being its primary
signification: (Er-Rághib:) the inf. n. خوار,
used agreeably with this explanation, occurs in
the Kur xx. 90 [and vii. 146]: (S:) it signifies
the loud crying [i. e. the lowing or bellowing] of
a cow and of a calf: (Lth:) and the crying [i. e.
bleating] of sheep, or that of goats, and of gazelles,
(K,) and of any beast: (Er-Rághib:) and the
sounding [i. e. whizzing] of arrows: (K:) of any
of these, you say, خَارَ, aor. and inf. n. as above.
(TA.) [Hence,] لَهُ صَوْتٌ كَخُوَارِ الثَّوْرِ He has a
voice like the bellowing of the bull. (A.) ―
-b2-  [And
hence, (see 10,)] خار عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  He bent, turned, or

(JK,) inf. n. خَوَرٌ; (S, * K, * TA;) and ↓ خِوِّر,
(JK, TA,) inf. n. تَخْوِيرٌ. (K.) خار and خَوِرَ

'Omar, لَنْ يَخُورَ قَوِىٌّ مَا دَامَ صَاحِبُهَا بَنْزِعُ وَيَنْزُو,
meaning A possessor of strength (صَاحِبُ قُوَّةٍ) will
not be weak as long as he can pull his bow and
leap to his beast. (TA.) In a camel that is
drinking, خَوَرٌ denotes, or implies, a quality that
is praised; i. e. Patient enduring of thirst and
fatigue: and a quality dispraised; i. e. the lacking patience to endure thirst and fatigue. (TA.)

primary acceptation, He caused him to utter a
cry. (See 10.) ―
-b2-  And hence,] (assumed tropical:)  He bent, turned,

make him bend, turn, or incline: (JK, S, A, K,
TA:) and he called him to him: and he interrogated him; or desired him to speak; syn. اِسْتَنْطَقَهُ:
namely, a man. (JK.) [استخار المَنْزِلَ is explained in the L and K as meaning اِسْتَنْظَفَهُ: to
which is added in the TA, كأنّه طلب خيره, with
the remark that it should therefore properly be
mentioned in art. خير: but an explanation in the
sentence immediately preceding, and a verse cited
below, evidently show that استنظفه is a mistranscription for اِسْتَنْطَقَهُ, and that خيره should be خَبَرَهُ:
so that the meaning is He interrogated the place
of abode.] The author of the L cites, as an ex.,
the saying of El-Kumeyt,
وَلَنْ يَسْتَخِيرُ رُسُومَ الدِّيَارِ
لِعَوْلَتِهِ ذُو الصِّبَى المُعوِلُ
[And he who is affected with youthful amorousness, wailing, will not ask the remains, or traces,
of the dwellings to reply to his wailing: but for
لِعَوْلَتِهِ I would rather read بِعَوْلَتِهِ; i. e., will not
interrogate them with his wailing]. (TA.) ―
