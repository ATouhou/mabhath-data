but for من الحجبتين, I read مِنْهُ الحَجَبَتَانِ;
referring, for corroboration, to explanations of
this last word; and therefore I have rendered
the passage as above: the meaning seems evidently to be the part between the lowest rib and
the crest of the hip, on each side:] the thin skin
which is above the خَصْر is called the طَفْطَفَة:
so in the M, agreeably with the saying of Ibn-El-Ajdábee, that ↓ الخَصْرُ and الخَاصِرَةُ are syn.;
i. e., in this sense: [this assertion, however,
requires consideration; for all the explanations
of الخاصرة are easily reconcileable:] pl. خَوَاصِرُ
[which is also used in the sense of the sing. or
dual]. (TA.) You say رَجُلٌ ضَخْمُ الخَواصِرِ [A
man large in the flank or flanks]: and Lh mentions the phrase إِنَّهَا لَمُنْتَفِخَةُ الخَوَصِرِ [Verily she
is inflated, or swollen, in the flank or flanks];
as though the term خاصرة were applicable to
every portion [of the flank]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also A
pain in the خَاصِرَة [or flank]: or in the kidneys.

أَخْصَرُ مِنْ ذَاكَ This [road] is shorter than that.

from اُخْتُصِرَ, a verb of more than three letters.

its fore part and heel; the middle of the sole
being hollow and narrow: this meaning, or a
meaning similar to that of يَدٌ مُخَصَّرَةٌ explained
below, seems to be indicated in the TA: the
latter is the meaning accord. to the JK; but this
[ think doubtful, on account of what here follows]. مُخَصَّرُ القَدَمَيْنِ means (tropical:)  A man whose

heel; the middle of the sole being hollow and
narrow: (S, K:) and you say also ↓ مَخْصُورُ

of resurrection: (IAth, Mgh, TA:) this latter is
apparently the right meaning: otherwise, two
trads. contradict each other. (MF.)
