خروخُرَةُ الفَأْسِ, as in the Tekmileh, on the authority
of Fr; in the K and accord. to Sgh, الفَأْسِ ↓ خُرْوَةُ,
which is a mistake; (TA;) The خُرْت [q. v. in
art. خرت] of the فأس: pl. خُرَاتٌ; (Fr, Sgh, K,
TA;) like as ثُبَةٌ has for its pl. ثُبَاتٌ. (TA.)
الخَرَاتَانِ Two stars, (K,) mentioned [and described] in art. خرت, (TA,) each of which is
[said to be] called خَرَاةٌ: (K:) accord. to ISd,
only the dual form of the word is known; and
the radical ت and the augmentative ت [by which
latter is meant ة] are in the dual alike: (TA:)
but Kr and others say that it is dual of خَرَاةٌ,
and belongs to this art. (TA in art. خرت.)
خُرْوَةٌ: see the first paragraph in this art.
