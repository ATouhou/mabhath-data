خندرسخَنْدَرِيسٌ Wine; (S, K;) so called because of
its oldness: (S:) or old wine: (TA:) [accord.
to some,] derived from خَدْرَسَةٌ, a word not explained: (K:) by some said to be of the measure
فَنْعَلِيسٌ, so that its radical letters are خدر; because wine is مُخَدِّر [i. e. a cause of torpor or
languor]: by some said to be from خَرْسٌ; but to
this it is objected that د is not augmentative: the
truth is, that it is of the measure فَعْلَلِيلٌ, as Sb
says: (MF:) by the author of the L and others,
it is mentioned after art. خنس: (TA:) or it is a
Greek word, arabicized: (K:) [but I know not
how this is, unless, as an epithet applied to wheat,
(see what follows,) it be supposed to be from
χόνδρο�:] IDrd thought it to be an arabicized
word: it may be an arabicized word from the
Persian خَنْدَهْ رِيشْ, meaning “ having a laughing
beard,” [or rather “one whose beard is laughed
at,” i. e., “a laughing-stock,”] because he who
makes use of it [namely of wine] has his beard
laughed at. (TA.) ―
-b2-  You also say, حِنْطَة خَنْدَرِيسٌ
Old wheat: (IDrd, S, K:) and تَمْرٌ خَنْدَرِيسٌ old
dates. (TA.)
