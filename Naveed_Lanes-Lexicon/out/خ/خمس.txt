the fourth part of the spoil in the Time of Ignorance, and I took the fifth part thereof in the
time of El-Islám]; meaning, I headed the army

Time of Ignorance, used to take the fourth part

assigned to him. (TA.) ―

[See خِمْسٌ.]
خَمْسٌ fem. of خَمْسَةٌ [q. v.].
خُمْسٌ: see خُمُسٌ.
خِمْسٌ The drinking of camels on the fifth day,
counting the day of the next preceding drinking
as the first; their drinking one day, then pasturing three days, then coming to the water on
the fifth day, the first and last days, on which
they drink, being thus reckoned: this is the correct explanation, accord. to Aboo-Sahl El-Khowlee; and Aboo-Zekereeyà says the like; (TA;)
or their pasturing three days, and coming to the
water on the fourth day [not counting the day of
the next preceding watering; for it is evident that
this explanation is virtually the same as that preceding]: (S, K:) accord. to Lth, the drinking of
camels on the fourth day, counting the day on
which they returned from [the next preceding]
watering; but Az says, that this is a mistake;
the day of returning from watering not being
counted [when it is explained as meaning the
drinking on the fourth day]: (TA:) pl. أَخْمَاسٌ,
the only pl. form. (Sb, TA.) [See ظِمْءٌ.] Hence,
فَلَاةٌ خِمْسٌ [as in copies of the K, or it may be
فَلَاةُ خِمْسٍ,] A desert in which the water is far
distant, so that the camels come to the water on
the fourth day, exclusive of the [next preceding]
day on which they drank. (Az, K, TA.) Hence
also the saying, فُلَانٌ يَضْرِبُ أَخْمَاسًا لِأَسْدَاسٍ (S,
K *) (tropical:)  Such a one makes a pretence of اخماس [or
fifth-day waterings] for the purpose of اسداس
[or sixth-day waterings]: i. e., he advances his
camels from the خِمْس to the سِدْس: (K:) a
prov.: (TA:) meaning, such a one strives to deceive, or circumvent: (S, K:) applied to him who
acts towards another with artifice, pretending that
he obeys him, or complies with his desire: (TA:)
or to him who pretends one thing while he means
another: (K:) and taken from the saying, related by AO and IAar, ضَرَبَ أَخْمَاسًا لِأَسْدَاسٍ [He
made a pretence of اخماس for the purpose of
اسداس]; said of him who proposes a thing
whereby he means another thing, which he commences and by slow degrees accomplishes: (TA:)
for a man, when he desires to make a long journey, accustoms his camels to drink خِمْسًا سِدْسًا
[i. e. on the fifth day and then on the sixth, in
each case counting the day of the next preceding
drinking as the first]: (K, TA:) the origin of
the saying, accord. to IAar, being this: an old
man was among his camels, accompanied by his
sons, men, who pastured them, and who had been
long far distant from their families; and he told
them one day to pasture their camels رِبْعًا [i. e.
watering on the fourth day, counting the day of
the next preceding watering as the first], which
they did, proceeding in the way towards their
families: then they proposed to do so خِمْسًا; and
then, سِدْسًا: whereupon the old man, understanding what they meant, said, ye are doing
nothing but making a pretence of اخماس for the
purpose of اسداس: the object of your desire is
not the pasturing of them, but it is only your
families. (TA.) [See below, voce خُمُسٌ, a saying
similar in words but different in meaning.] ―
-b2-
It is also used for سَيْرُ خِمْسٍ [A journey in which
the camels are watered only on the first and fifth
days; a journey in which the second and third
and fourth days are without water]. (L in art.
جلذ.) You say خِمسٌ بَصْبَاصٌ, [and صَبْصَابٌ,]
and قَعْقَاعٌ, and حَثْحَاثٌ, [and حَصْحَاصٌ, &c.,]
i. e. A journey [in which the camels are watered
only on the first and fifth days,] in the course of
which, to the water, there is no flagging, by
reason of its remoteness. (TA.) El-'Ajjáj uses
the expression
خِمْسٌ كَحَبْلِ الشَّعَرِ المُنْحَتِّ
meaning, A [journey of the kind termed] خمس
without any deviation, like a rope made of hair
that has fallen off and that is free from any unevenness. (L, TA.) ―
-b3-  خِمْسٌ also signifies The
fifth young one, or offspring. (A in art. ثلث.)
-A2-  A [garment of the kind called] بُرْد, (S, K,) of
the fabric of El-Yemen; (S;) so called because
first made for a king of El-Yemen named خِمْسٌ,
(AA, S,) or الخِمْسُ; (K, TA;) as also ↓ خَمِيسٌ.
(TA.) For the latter word, we find in the work
of Bkh, خَمِيص, with ص; which, if correct, is
masc. of خَمِيصَةٌ, which is a small kind of كِسَآء.
(IAth, and L.) [The pl. of خِمْسٌ applied to a بُرْدَة
is أَخْمَاسٌ.] See also مَخْمُوسٌ, in four places.
خُمُسٌ and ↓ خُمْسٌ A fifth part; (Msb, K;)
as also ↓ خَمِيسٌ, (S, in art. ثلث, and IAmb and
Msb,) agreeably with a rule applicable in the
case of every one of the units, except ثَلِيثٌ:
(TA:) some allow this last; but AZ disallows it,
and خميس also: (S in art. ثلث:) pl. أَخْمَاسٌ.
(Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] ضَرَبَ أَخْمَاسَهُ فِى
أَسْدَاسِهِ He turned his five senses towards his six
relative points; [namely, above, below, before,
behind, right, and left:] an allusion to the collecting all the thoughts to examine a thing, and
turning the attention in all directions. (MF.)
خَمْسَةٌ, (S, K,) masc.; and خَمْسٌ, fem.; (S;)
[Five;] a certain number. (S, K.) You say
خَمْسَةُ رِجَالٍ [Five men], and خَمْسُ نِسْوَةٍ [Five
women]. (S.) You say also, عِنْدِى خَمْسَةُ دَرَاهِمْ
[I have five dirhems], with refa: and if you
please, you incorporate the ة into the د [and say,
خَمْسَة دَّرَاهِمَ]: but when you prefix ال to دراهم,
you say, عِنْدِى خَمْسَةُ الدَّرَاهِمِ [I have the five
dirhems], with damm; and may not incorporate,
because you have incorporated the ل into the د:
and in the case of a fem. n. you say, عِنْدِى خَمْسُ
القُدُورِ [I have the five cooking-pots]: also, هٰذِهِ
الخَمْسَةُ الدَّرَاهِمِ [These five dirhems]; and, if you
please, الدَّرَاهِمُ, using it in the manner of an
epithet: and in like manner [you use the other
nouns of number] to عَشَرَةٌ [inclusive]. (S.) You
say also, صُمْنَا خَمْسًا مِنَ الشَّهْرِ [We fasted during
a period of five nights of the month with their
days]; making لَيَالٍ to predominate over أَيَّام,
when you do not mention the word ايّام, though
the fasting is in the day; because the night of
each day precedes the day: but when you mention the word ايّام, you say, صُمْنَا خَمْسَةَ أَيَّامٍ [We
fasted five days]. (ISk, TA.) يَعَضُّ بِالخَمْسِ
means He bites the fingers: these being [five in
number and] of the fem gender: (Ham p. 790:)
[i. e.] خَمْسٌ means the five fingers. (Har p. 76.)
[Respecting a peculiar pronunciation of the
people of El-Hijáz, and a case in which خَمْسَة is
imperfectly decl., see ثَلَاثَةٌ.] ―
-b2-  [خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ,
masc.; and خَمْسَ عَشْرَةَ, fem.; Fifteen. For
variations thereof, see art. عشر.]
خَمْسُونَ [Fifty, and fiftieth,] is also written
and pronounced خَمِسُونَ, with kesr to the خَمَسُونَ, by
poetic license, as related by Ks; or م, with
fet-h, as related by others, after the manner of
خَمْسَةٌ and خَمَسَاتٌ: (Fr, TA:) accord. to the T,
the variation خَمِسُونَ, with kesr to the م, is
[dialectic, being] similar to خَمْسَ عَشِرَةَ, with kesr
to the ش [in the dial. of Nejd]. (TA.)
جَاؤُوا خُمَاسَ, and ↓ مَخْمَسَ, They came five
and five; [or five and five together; or five at a
time and five at a time;] (K, TA;) like as they
say, ثُنَآءَ and مَثْنَى, and رُبَاعَ and مَرْبَعَ: (TA:)
or, accord. to A 'Obeyd, not more than أُحَادَ and
ثُنَآءَ and ثُلَاثَ and رُبَاعَ has been heard, except
عُشَارَ occurring in a verse of El-Kumeyt. (TA in
art. عشر.)
خَمِيسٌ: see خُمُسٌ: ―
-b2-  and مَخْمُوسٌ, in two
places. ―
-b3-  An army; because consisting of five
parts, namely, the van, the body, the right wing,
the left wing, and the rear; (S, A, K;) or because
the spoils are divided into fifths among it; but
this latter assertion requires consideration; (ISd,
MF;) for this division of the spoils is an affair of
the Muslim law, whereas خميس [thus applied] is
an old term: (MF:) or an army having numerous
weapons; syn. جَيْشٌ خَشِنٌ. (TA.) ―
-b4-  يَوْمُ الخَمِيسِ,
(S, Msb, K,) and simply الخَمِيسُ, Thursday; the
fifth day of the week; thus used for الخَامِسُ, in like
manner as الدَّبَرَانُ is applied to the star [that
follows the Pleiades, for الدَّابِرُ]: (TA:) pl. [of
pauc.] أَخْمِسَةٌ and [of mult.] أَخْمِسَآءُ (S, Msb, K)
and أَخَامِسُ. (Fr, TA.) AZ used to say, مَضَى
الخَمِيسُ بِمَا فِيهِ [Thursday passed with what
happened in it], making it sing. and masc.: but
Abu-l-Jarráh used to say, مَضَىالخَمِيسُ بِمَ فِيهِنَّ,
making it pl. and fem., and using it as a n. of
number. (Lh, TA.) It has no dim. (Sb, S in
art. امس.)
-A2-  See also خِمْسٌ, last signification.
-A3-  مَا أَدْرِى أَىُّ خَمِيسِ النَّاسِ هُوَ means I know
not what company of men it is. (Ibn-' Abbád,
Sgh, K.)
خُمَاسِىٌّ A boy five spans (أَشْبَار) in height:
(S, Mgh, Msb, * K:) said of him who is increasing in height [but has not attained his full
stature]: (Msb:) fem. with ة: (Lth, TA:) and
in like manner you say رُبَاعِىٌّ: (S, Msb:) but
you do not say سُبَاعِىٌّ, (Lth, S, K,) nor سُدَاسِىٌّ;
(Lth, K;) [i. e., in speaking of a boy;] for when
he has attained seven spans, (S,) or six spans,
(Lth, K,) he is a man: (Lth, S, K:) or to a
slave you apply the epithet سداسىّ also; and to
a garment, or piece of cloth, سباعىّ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-
See also مَخْمُوسٌ. ―
-b3-  [Also A word composed of
five letters, radical only, or radical and augmentative.]
خَمِيسِىٌّ One who fasts alone on Thursday.
(IAar, Th.)
خَامِسٌ [Fifth]: for this you also say خَامٍ;
(ISk, S, K;) whence the phrase, جَآئَ فُلَانٌ
خَامِيًا [Such a one came fifth], for خَامِسًا: (ISk,
S:) [fem. with ة.] ―
-b2-  [خَامِسَ عَشَرَ and خَامِسَة
عَشْرَةَ, the former masc. and the latter fem., meaning Fifteenth, are subject to the same rules as
ثَالِثَ عَشَرَ and its fem., explained in art. ثلث,
q. v.]
-A2-  إِبِلٌ خَامِسَةٌ (TA) and خَوَامِسُ (S, K)
Camels that drink on the fifth day, counting the
day of the next preceding drinking as the first:
[see خِمْسٌ:] (TA:) or that pasture three days,
coming to the water on the fourth day [not
counting the day of the next preceding watering].
(S, K.)
جَاؤُوا مَخْمَسَ: see خُمَاسَ.
مُخَمَّسٌ A thing five-cornered; five-angled;
pentagonal. (S.) [See also مُثَلَّثٌ.]
مَخْمُوسٌ Five cubits in length; applied to a
spear, (S, A, K,) as also ↓ خَمِيسٌ; (K;) and to
a garment, or piece of cloth, (S, A, K,) as also
↓ خَمِيسٌ, (S, A, Mgh, K,) which occurs in a trad.
as meaning a small garment or piece of cloth,
(Mgh,) and ↓ خُمَاسِىٌّ [q. v. suprà]; (TA;) and
in like manner, ↓ بُرْدَةُ أَخْمَاسٍ a [garment of the
kind called] بردة fire cubits long. (ISk, TA.)
Hence the saying, ↓ هُمَا فِى بُرْدَة أَخْمَاسٍ (assumed tropical:)  They
two have become near together, and in a state of
agreement. (K.) A poet says,
صَيَّرَنِى جُودُ يَدَيهِ وَمَنْ
↓ أَهْوَاهُ فِى بُرْدَةِ أَخْمَاسِ
i. e., (assumed tropical:)  The bounty of his hands has made me and
the person whom I love to be near together, as
though we were in a بردة five cubits long: (Th,
TA:) app. meaning that the person thus spoken
of had purchased for him a female slave, or had
given for him the dowry of his wife. (Az, Sgh,
TA.) You also say, ↓ لَيْتَنَافِى بُرْدَةِ أَخْمَاسٍ, a
prov., meaning (assumed tropical:)  Would that we were near together. (ISk, TA.) [See also بُرْدٌ.] ―
-b2-  Also A
rope made of five strands twisted together. (S,
A, K.)
