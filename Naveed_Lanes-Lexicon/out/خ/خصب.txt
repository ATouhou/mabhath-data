اخصب, (A, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِخْصَابٌ;
(TA;) [and some add خِصْبٌ, as another inf. n.;
but ISd holds this to be a simple subst.; (see 4
in art. ريف;)] and ↓ خَصِبَ, (A, Msb, K,) aor.
خَصَبَ;
(Msb, K;) and ↓ خَصَبَ, aor.
خَصِبَ, inf. n. خِصْبٌ;
(K;) It (a place) abounded, or became abundant,
with herbage [or with the produce of the earth],
and with the goods, conveniences, or comforts, of
life; (A, K;) [was, or became, fruitful;] had
increase; had plenty, or abundance; (Msb;)
[contr. of أَجْدَبَ and جَدِبَ or جَدَبَ and جَدُبَ:]
and اخصبت الأَرْضُ [the land, or earth, abounded,
or became abundant, with herbage &c.]. (JK,
S.) إِخْصَابٌ and ↓ اِخْتِصَابٌ are both from الخِصْبُ
[but the precise meaning of the latter is not explained]. (Lth, JK, TA.) In the saying of the
rájiz,
لَقَدْ خَشِيتُ أَنْ أَرَى جَدِبَّا
فِى عَامِنَا ذَا بَعْدَ أَنْ أَخْصَبَّا
[Verily I feared to see drought, or barrenness,
or dearth, in this our year, after it had been
abundant in herbage &c.], أَخْصَبَّا is put for أَخْصَبَا:
but accord. to one reading, it is ↓ اِخْصَبَّا, of the
measure اِفْعَلَّ, though this is generally employed
for colours; and the incipient ا is rendered disjunctive of necessity, for the sake of the metre.
(L. [Respecting جِدَبَّا, see جَدْبٌ.]) You say
also, اخصب جَنَابُ القَوْمِ, meaning The tract surrounding the people [became abundant with
herbage &c.]. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  اخصبوا They attained,
obtained, had, or became in the condition of having, abundance of herbage [or of the produce of
the earth], and of the goods, conveniences, or
comforts, of life. (S, * K.) [They became in the
condition of persons whose food and milk, and the
pasture of whose land, were abundant. (See the
part. n., مُخْصِبٌ, below.)] And اخصبت الشَّاةُ
The ewe, or she-goat, obtained abundance of
herbage. (TA.)
-A2-  اخصب اللّٰهُ المَوْضِعِ God
caused the place to produce herbs and pasture.
(Msb.)
-A3-  اخصبت العِضَاهُ, mentioned as on the
authority of Lth, [and in the K,] is, accord. to
Az, a gross mistranscription, for اخصبت [q. v.].

-b3-  It is
said that ↓ خَصْبٌ signifies also The spadix of the
palm-tree: so in the K: and accord. to Lth,
خَصْبَةٌ signifies a single spadix of a palm-tree:
but [it is probably a mistranscription for خَضْبَةٌ,
with the pointed ض:] Az says that he who assigns to it this meaning errs. (TA.)
