خنرخَنَوَّرٌ: and الخَنَوَّرٌ: and أُمُّ خَنَوَّرٍ: see what follows, in four places.
خَنُّورٌ and ↓ خَنَوَّرٌ Any soft and weak tree: (K:)
or such is called خنورة [i. e. خَنُّورَةٌ or حَنَوَّرَةٌ:
each, without ة, being app. a coll. gen. n.; and
with ة, a n. un.]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And hence, accord.
to AHn, (TA,) The reeds of [which are made]
arrows. (K.)
-A2-  أُمُّ خَنُّورٍ (S, K) and أُمُّ خِنَّوْرٍ
(K) The female hyena: (S, K:) or she is called
by the latter appellation, accord. to Aboo-Riyásh:
or, as some say, these are surnames of the hyena.
(TA.) And The cow [probably the wild cow].
(Aboo-Riyásh, K.) ―
-b2-  Also Calamity, or misfortune. (S, K.) You say, وَقَعَ القَوْمُ فِى أُمِّ خَنُّورٍ The
people, or party, fell into calamity, or misfortune.
(L, TA. But see two other explanations in what
follows.) ―
-b3-  And Plentifulness, and pleasantness
or easiness, and softness or delicacy, of life; or
a life of softness or delicacy, and ease, comfort,
or affluence; syn. النَّعْمَةُ: [in the CK النِّعْمَةُ;
which is in many instances in the CK, as I hold
it to be in the present instance, erroneously substituted for النَّعْمَةُ:] thus bearing two contrary
significations: and الخَنُّورُ and ↓ الخَنَوَّرُ signify
the same, such as is apparent; (K;) or, as some
say, abundant. (TA.) Some explain the saying
above-mentioned as meaning The people, or party,
fell into a state of plenty, or abundance, and
softness or delicacy or easiness of life. (TA.) ―
-b4-
And The present world; or the present life, or
state of existence; as also ↓ أُمُّ خَنَوَّرٍ: (L:) or so
الخِنَّوْرُ and ↓ الخَنَوَّرُ. (K.) ―
-b5-  And The deserts;
syn. الصَّحَارَى: and so accord. to some in the
saying mentioned above. (TA.) ―
-b6-  And The
podex, or the anus; syn. الاِسْتُ: (K:) but
AHát doubts respecting the teshdeed of the ن;
[app. whether this letter be doubled, or the و;]
Aboo-Sahl says that it is أُمُّ خِنَّوْرٍ [only]: and
IKh says that it means the اِسْت of the bitch.
(TA.)
