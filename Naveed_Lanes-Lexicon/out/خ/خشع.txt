became, lowly, humble, or submissive; (S, Msb,
K;) as also ↓ اختشع (S, K) and ↓ تخشّع; (Abu-lFet-h, Ham pp. 24 and 127;) خُشُوعٌ being syn.
with خُضُوعٌ: (S, Msb, K:) or خشوع is nearly
the same as خضوع: (Lth, K:) or the former is
mostly used as meaning in the voice; and the
latter, in the necks: (Msb:) or the latter is in
the body; and the former is in the voice and in
the eyes: (K:) or, as we read in the 'Eyn, the
