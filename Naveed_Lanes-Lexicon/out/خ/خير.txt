latter is extr. [with respect to form, though more
commonly used than the former], (TA,) [How
good is such a one!] phrases similar to مَاأَشَّرَهُ

desert, in the presence of Aboo-Zeyd; whereupon
Khalaf said to him, “What a good word, if thou
hadst not defiled it by mentioning it to the [common] people! ” and Aboo-Zeyd returned to his
companions, and desired them, when Khalaf ElAhmar should come, to say, all together, these
words (ما خير اللبن للمريض), [in order to vex
him], and they did so. (TA.)

عَلَيْهِمْ, (K,) which last signifies in preference to
them. (TA.) It is said in the Kur [vii. 154],
وَاخْتَارَ مُوسَى قَوْمِهِ سَبْعِينَ رَجُلًا [And Moses chose
from his people seventy men]. (TA.) وَلَقَدِ
اخْتَرْنَاهُمْ عَلَى عِلْمٍ, in the Kur [xliv. 31, Verily
we have chosen them with knowledge], may be

the blessing, prospering, or favour, of God; &c.;

rather the better in it, meaning a case, or an
affair,] and He chose it for me. (A.) ―
-b2-  See

خَيْرٌ [Good, moral or physical; anything that
is good, real or ideal, and actual or potential;
and, being originally an inf. n., used as sing and
pl.;] a thing that all desire; such as intelligence,
for instance, and equity; (Er-Rághib, and so in
some copies of the K;) [or goodness;] and excellence; and what is profitable or useful; benefit;
(Er-Rághib;) contr. of شَرٌّ: (S, A, Msb:) pl.
خُيُورٌ, (Msb, K,) and also, accord. to the Msb,
↓ خِيَارٌ: (TA:) [but this latter seems to be properly pl. only of خَيْرٌ used as an epithet (see
below) and as a noun denoting the comparative
and superlative degrees: it may however be used
as an epithet in which the quality of a subst. is
predominant:] خير is of two kinds: namely,
absolute خير, which is what is desired in all circumstances and by every person: and what is
خير [or good] to one and شرّ [or evil] to another;
as, for instance, (Er-Rághib,) wealth, or property: (Zj, L in art. شد, Er-Rághib, K:) it
has this last signification, namely wealth, or property, in the Kur, ii. 176 (S, TA) and ii. 274 and
xxiv. 33 and xli. 49: or in the first and second of
these instances it is thus called to imply the meaning of wealth, or property, that has been collected in a praiseworthy manner, or it means
much wealth or property; and this is its meaning in the first of the instances mentioned above,
agreeably with a trad. of 'Alee; and also in the
Kur, c. 8: (TA:) [being used as a pl. (as well
as a sing.), it may be also rendered good things:]
and it is also used by the Arabs to signify horses;
(K, * TA;) and has this meaning in the Kur,
xxxviii. 31: (TA:) [it is often best rendered
good fortune; prosperity; welfare; wellbeing;
weal; happiness; or a good state or condition:
and sometimes bounty, or beneficence.] رَجُلٌ قَلِيلُ
الخَيْرِ means [A man possessing little, or no, good;
possessing few, or no, good things; or poor: and
in whom is little, or no, good or goodness; or
niggardly: and also] a man who does little good:
(TA in art. عص:) or [who does no good;] who
is not near to doing good; denoting the nonexistence of good in him. (Msb in art. قل.)
[Thus it sometimes means the same as رَجُلٌ لَا
خَيْرَ فِيهِ A man in whom is no good or goodness;
devoid of goodness; worthless.] And قِلَّةُ خَيْرٍ
means Poverty: and also niggardliness. (A and
TA in art. جحد.) هُوَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الخَيْرِ وَالخِيرِ is
explained voce خِيرٌ. عَلَىيَدَىِ الخَيْرِ وَاليُمْنِ
[May it be with the aid of good fortune and prosperity] is a prayer used with respect to a marriage. (A 'Obeyd, TA.) And إِنَّكَ مَا وَخَيْرًا means
مَعَ خَيْرٍ, i. e., Mayest thou meet with, or attain,
good. (K.) ―
-b2-  خَيْرٌ in the phrase فُلَانٌ خَيْرٌ resembles an epithet [like ↓ خَيِّرٌ, and signifies
Good; or possessing good]; (Akh, S;) therefore
the fem. is خَيْرَةٌ, of which the pl. is خَيْرَاتٌ, (Akh,
S, Msb, *) as occurring in the Kur, lv. 70; and
they do not [there] mean by it [the comparative
or superlative signification of the measure] أَفْعَلُ:
(Akh, S:) you say ↓ رَجُلٌ خَيِّرٌ, (S, A, Msb,)
meaning [A good man; or] a man possessing خَيْر
[or good]; (Msb;) and رَجُلٌ خَيْرٌ: (S:) and in
like manner, ↓ اِمْرَأَةٌ خَيِّرَةٌ and خَيْرَةٌ, (S, Msb,)
meaning [A good woman; or] a woman excellent
in beauty and disposition: (Msb:) or خَيْرٌ and
↓ خَيِّرٌ signify possessing much خَيْر [or good], (K,)
applied to a man; (TA;) and in the same sense
you say ↓ رَجُلٌ خَيْرَى, and ↓ خُورَى, and ↓ خِيَرى:
and the fem. of the first is خَيْرَةٌ; and of the
second, ↓ خَيِّرَةٌ: (K:) and the pl. [of pauc.] (of
the first, TA) is أَخْيَارٌ, and [of mult.] خِيَارٌ: (A,
Msb, K:) you say also خِيَارُ المَالِ, meaning The
excellent of the camels or the like: (Msb, K:) and
in like manner you say of men &c.: (TA:) [see
also below:] and the fem. is خَيْرَةٌ, of which the
pl. is خَيْرَاتٌ: (Msb:) خِيَارٌ is contr. of أَشْرَارٌ, (S,
Mgh,) [thus] used as an epithet: (Mgh:) and
↓ خَيْرَةٌ [used as a subst.] signifies anything excellent; and the pl. thereof in this sense, خَيْرَاتٌ,
occurs in the Kur, ix. 89: (S:) or خَيْرٌ, (K,) or
the fem. خَيْرَةٌ, (Lth,) or each, (K.) signifies excellent in beauty: (Lth, K:) and ↓ خَيِّرٌ and خَيِّرَةٌ
signify excellent in righteousness (Lth, K) and
religion: (K:) or there is no difference in the
opinion of the lexicologists [in general] between
خَيْرَةٌ and ↓ خَيِّرَةٌ: (Az:) accord. to Zj, خَيْرَاتٌ and
↓ خَيِّرَاتٌ, both occurring in different readings of
the Kur, lv. 70, signify good in dispositions:
accord. to Khálid Ibn-Jembeh, خَيْرَةٌ, applied to a
woman, signifies generous in race, exalted in
rank or quality or reputation, goodly in face,
good in disposition, possessing much wealth, who,
if she bring forth, brings forth a generous child:
(TA:) [↓ خِيَارٌ is also applied as an epithet to a
sing. subst., either masc. or fem.:] you say جَمَلٌ
خِيَارٌ and نَاقَةٌ خِيَارٌ, meaning A he-camel [that is
excellent or] excellent and brisk and so a she-camel. (TA.) See also مُخْتَارٌ, in three places.
In the saying لَعَمَرُ أَبِيكَ الخَيْرُ, the word خَيْر is
in the nom. case as an epithet of عَمْر; [so that
the phrase lit. means By the good life of thy
father;] but properly it should be لَعَمْرُ أَبِيكَ
الخَيْرِ [By the life of thy good father]: and the
like is said with شَرّ. (TA.) [See also art. عمر.]
―
-b3-  خَيْرٌ is also used to denote superiority: one
says, هٰذَا خَيْرٌ مِنْ هٰذَا This is better than this:
and in the dial. of the Benoo-'Ámir, ↓ هٰذَا أَخْيَرُ
مِنْ هٰذَا, with أ, and in like manner, أَشَّرُ; but
the rest of the Arabs drop the أ in each case:
(Msb:) you say, مِنْكَ ↓ هُوَ أَخْيَرُ [He is better
than thou], and in like manner, أَشَّرُ مِنْكَ; and
هُوَ خَيْرٌ مِنْكَ, and in like manner, شَرٌّ مِنْكَ; and,
[using the dim. form of خَيْرٌ,] مِنْكَ ↓ خُيَيْرٌ, and in
like manner, شُرَيْرٌ مِنْكَ. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA.) You
also say, when you mean to express the signification of superiority, فُلَانَةٌ خَيْرُ النَّاسِ [Such a
woman is the best of mankind]; but not خَيْرَةُ:
[see, however, what will be found cited hereafter
from the K,] and فُلَانٌ خَيْرُ النَّاسِ [Such a man is
the best of mankind]; but not ↓ أَخْيَرُ [unless in
the dial. of the Benoo-'Ámir]: and [it is said
that] خَيْرُ when thus used does not assume the
dual form nor the pl., because it has the signification of [the measure] أَفْعَلُ: for though a poet
uses the dual form, he uses it as a contraction of
the dual of خَيِّرٌ, like مَيْتٌ and مَيِّتٌ, and هَيْنٌ
and هَيِّنٌ: (S:) [but. this remark in the S is incorrect: for both خَيْر and ↓ أَخْيَر, when used in
such phrases as those to which J here refers,
have pl. forms of frequent occurrence, and of
which examples will be found below; and, as is
said by I 'Ak (p. 239), and by many other grammarians, you may say, الزَّيْدَانِ أَفْضَلَا القَوْمِ, and
الزَّيْدُونَ أَفْضَلُو القَوْمِ and أَفَاضِلُ القَوْمِ, and also
هِنْدُ فُضْلَىالنِّسَآءِ, &c.; and such concordance is
found in the Kur, vi. 123; and is even said by
many to be more chaste than the mode prescribed
by J:] it is said in the K, that you say, ↓ هُوَ أَخْيَرُ
مِنْكَ, like خَيْرُ; and when you mean the signification of superiority, you say فُلَانٌ خَيْرَةٌ النَّاسِ,
with ة, and فُلَانَةُ خَيْرُهُمْ, without ة: but [SM says,]
I know not how this is; for in the S is said what
is different from this, and in like manner by Z in
several places in the Ksh; and what is most
strange is, that the author of the K quotes in the
B the passage of J [from the S], and adopts the
opinion of the leading authorities [as given in the
S]: (TA:) or you say, فُلَانَةُ الخَيْرَةُ مِنَ المَرْأَتَيْنِ
[Such a woman is the better of the two women]:
and هِىَ الخَيْرَةُ, and ↓ الخِيرَةُ, [so in the TA, but
in the CK الخِيَرَةُ,] and ↓ الخِيرَى, and ↓ الخُورَى,
[the last being fem. of أَخْيَرُ, originally خُيْرَى,
and so, app., the last but one, She is the better, or
best:] (K:) and [using the dim. form of خَيْرٌ]
you say, أَهْلِهِ ↓ هُوَ خُيَيْرُ [He is the best of his
family]: (Ibn-Buzurj, TA:) one says also, to
one coming from a journey, خَيْرَ مَا رُدَّ فِى أَهْلٍ
وَمَالٍ, meaning May God make that with which
thou comest [back] to be the best of what is
brought back by the absent with family and property; (As, Meyd, TA;) or, as some relate it,
خَيْرُ, i. e. رَدُّكَ خَيْرُ رَدٍّ [may thy bringing back be
the best bringing back]; and فى is used in the
sense of مَعَ: (Meyd:) [أَخْيَارٌ is pl. of pauc.,
and خِيَارٌ pl. of mult., and so app. is خِيرَانٌ, of
خَيْرٌ thus used; and ↓ أَخَايِرُ is pl. of أَخْيَرُ, and so
is أَخْيَرُونَ applied to rational beings: in the TA,
أَخَايِرُ is said to be a pl. pl. of أَخْيَرُ, and so خِيرَانٌ;
but this is app. a mistake, probably of transcription:] you say رَجُلٌ مِنْ خِيَارِ النَّاسِ and أَخْيَارِهِمْ
and ↓ أَخَايِرِهِمْ [A man of the best of mankind]:
(A, TA:) and لَكَ خِيَارُ هٰذِهِ الإِبِلِ, and ↓ خِيرَتُهَا,
[Thine are, or is, or shall be, the best of these
camels,] alike with respect to a sing. and a pl.:
(TA:) and إِبِلِهِ ↓ نَحَرَ خِيرَةَ and إِبِلِهِ ↓ خُورَةَ

TA:) and ↓ هُمُ الأَخْيَرُونَ [They (meaning men)
are the better, or best]. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA.)

قَاقُلَّة [or common cardamom], (K,) of sweet
odour. (TA.)
خِيرٌ Generousness; generosity; (S, A, Msb,
K;) liberality; munificence. (Msb.) You say,

one, good in an affair: or his choosing for one the
better thing in an affair: or] the state that results
to him who begs God to cause him to have good,

some say, خِيرَةٌ and خِيَرَةٌ are syn.: (Msb:) see 8;

of خَارَ. (S, TA.)
أَخْيَرُ, and its pls. أَخَايِرُ and أَحْيَرُونَ: see خَيْرٌ,
in eight places, in the latter half of the paragraph.
اِخْتِيَارِىٌّ [Of, or relating to, the will, or choice].
صِفَةٌ اخْتِيَارِيَّةٌ [meaning A quality which originates
from, or depends upon, the will, or choice, i. e.
an acquired quality,] is opposed to خِلْقِيَّةٌ. (Msb
in art. مدح, &c.)
مَخْيَرَةٌ [A cause of good: and hence,] excel-lence, and eminence, or nobility: so in the phrase,
فُلَانٌ ذُو مَخْيَرَةٍ [Such a one is a possessor of eminence, &c.]. (A, TA.)
مُخَيِّرٌ: see what follows.
مُخْتَارٌ act. part. n. [of 8, signifying Choosing,
selecting, or electing]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And pass. part. n.
[of the same, signifying Chosen, selected, elected,
or preferred: and choice, select, or elect; as also
↓ خِيَارٌ, which signifies like wise the best of anything;
often used in this sense, as a sing. and as a pl.; and
excellent, or excellent and brisk, applied to a he-camel and to a she-camel; as mentioned above, voce
خَيْرٌ]. (TA.) You say also ↓ جَمَلٌ خِيَارٌ in the
sense of مُخْتَارٌ [A choice he-camel], and نَاقَةٌ
↓ خِيَارٌ in the sense of مُخْتَارَةٌ [A choice she-camel].
(TA.) [See also خِيَرَةٌ.] The dim. of مُخْتَارٌ is
↓ مُخَيِّرٌ: the ت is thrown out because it is augmentative; and the ى is changed into ى because
it was changed from ى in مختار: (S:) one
should not say مُخَيْتِيرٌ. (El-Hareeree's Durrat
el-Ghowwás, in De Sacy's Anthol. Gr. Ar. p. 49
of the Arabic text.) ―
-b3-  See also خِيَارٌ.
