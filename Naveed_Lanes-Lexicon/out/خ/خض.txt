خضR. Q. 1
خَضْخَضَةٌ, (S, O,) inf. n. خَضْخَضَةٌ,
(S, O, K,) He agitated it; moved it about;
stirred it; shook it; namely, water, (S, O, K,)
and the like, (S, O,) and سَوِيق, and the like.
(O, K.) You say also, خَضْخَضْتُ دَلْوِى فِى المَآءِ
[I agitated, or dashed about, my bucket in the
water]. (O, TA.) Sakhr-el-Gheí El-Hudhalee
says, describing a water to which he had come for
drink,
فَخَضْخَضْتُ ضُفْنِىَ فِى جَمِّهِ
خِيَاضَ المُدَابِرِ قِدْحًا عَطُوفَا
(O, TA,) i. e. [And I dashed about my leathern
bucket in the main body thereof,] as he who is
overcome in the game of el-meysir introduces
among the other arrows a borrowed arrow [that
comes forth winning], in the luck of which he has
confidence. (TA in art. خوض.) This verb,
though mentioned here, is [said to be] from خَاضَ,
aor. يَخُوضُ; not from خَضَّ; therefore the poet
here uses خَيِاض for its inf. n. (O, TA.) You
also say, جَآءَهُ بِالخَنْجَرِ فَخَضْخَضَ بِهِ بَطْنَهُ [He
came to him with the dagger, and stirred about
with it his belly]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence a meaning
of the inf. n. explained in the first paragraph of
art. جلد.]
