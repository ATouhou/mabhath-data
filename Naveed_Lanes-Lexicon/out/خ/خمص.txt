خَمِيصَةٌ A [garment of the kind called] كِسَآء,
black, square, and having عَلَمَانِ [i. e. two ornamental or coloured or figured borders]: (S, A,
Mgh, K:) or a black كساء, having a border such
as is above described (مُعْلَم) at each end, and
which is of خَزّ, [q. v.], or of wool: (Msb:) if
not bordered, it is not so called: (S, Msb:) or,
accord. to As, a مُلَآءَة of wool, or of خَزّ, bordered
(مُعْلَمَة); not unless bordered: so called because
of its softness and thinness, and smallness of bulk
when it is folded: Ahmad Ibn-Fáris says that it
is the black كِسَآء: and he says that it may be
thus called because a man wraps himself with it,
so that it is against his أَخْمَص, meaning by this
his waist: (Har p. 21:) pl. خَمَائِصُ: or خمائص
are garments of خَزّ, thick, black, and red, and
having thick أَعْلَام [or borders such as above described]; worn by people of old. (TA.) El-Aashà
says,
إِذَا جُرِّدَتْ يَوْمًا حَسِبْتَ خَمِيصَةً
عَلَيْهَا وَ جِرْيَالَ النَّضِيرِ الدُّلَامِصَا
[When she is stripped of her clothing, any day,
thou wouldst think there was upon her a khameesah, and the glistening redness of gold]: As
says, he likens her [long and spreading] hair to a
خميصة, which is black. (S.) [See also خَمِيسٌ,
voce خِمْسٌ, near the end of the paragraph.]
خَامِصُ البَطْنِ: see خَمِيصٌ.
أَخْمَصُ القَدَمِ A man whose foot rises from the
ground, [or is hollow in the middle of the sole,]
so that it does not touch it: fem. خَمْصَآءُ: and
pl. خُمْصٌ: (Msb:) and ↓ خُمْصَانٌ signifies having
the middle of the sole of the foot moderately rising
from the ground; which is a goodly quality;
but when it is flat, or rises much, it is dispraised:
so explained by IAar when he was asked by Th
respecting 'Alee's saying of Mohammad, [cited,
but not explained, in the K,] كَانَ خُمْصَانَ
الأَخْمَصَيْنِ: or, accord. to Az, خُمْصَانٌ signifies
having the part [of the sole] of the foot which
does not cleave to the ground in treading very
much retiring from the ground. (TA.) ―
-b2-
الأَخْمَصُ [when without the article ال also written
without tenween accord. to the best authorities,
because the quality of an epithet is original to it,
and that of a subst. is accidental,] also signifies
The part [of the sole] of the human foot which
does not cleave to the ground in treading; (Az,
TA;) the part of the sole of the human foot which
is hollow, so that it does not touch the ground;
(S, K; *) the part of the bottom of the human foot
which is thin, and retires from the ground; or,
as some explain it, [meaning the same,] the خَصْر
of the human foot: (TA:) pl. أَخَامِصُ. (Msb.)
