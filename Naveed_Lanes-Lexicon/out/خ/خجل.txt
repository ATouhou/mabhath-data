خجل1
خَجِلَ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) aor.
خَجَلَ, (K,) inf. n.
خَجَلٌ, (S, Msb, &c.,) but not خَجَالَةٌ, [though
authorized by the KL, in my copy of which I
find it thus written (not خِجَالَةٌ as written by
Golius),] for this is a vulgar mistake for خَجَلَةٌ
or خَجْلٌ, (Mgh, [so in my copy, but correctly
↓ خَجَلَةٌ (which may be either a simple subst. or
an inf. n. of un.) or خَجَلٌ,]) He was, or became,
confounded, or perplexed, and unable to see his
right course, by reason of shame: (S, O:) or

perplexed, and unable to see his right course, (T,
M, K,) [or, simply, ashamed, (see خَجِلٌ,)] in
consequence of a deed that he had done: (T, M,
TA:) thus الخَجَلُ has a more particular signification than الحَيَآءُ: (TA:) or it is like الاِسْتِحْيَآءُ.

still, (M,) not speaking nor moving. (K.) ―

also signifies The bearing richness ill; as when,
being rich, one exults, or exults greatly or excessively, and behaves insolently and unthankfully:
(S, * K:) or the taking a wide, or an ample,
range, or being profuse, when rich. (TA.) It is
related in a trad. that he [Mohammad] said to the
women, إِذَا جُعْتُنَّ وَ إِذَا شَبِعْتُنَّ خَجِلْتُنَّ,
(S, * TA,) i. e. When ye are hungry, ye become
lowly, humble, or submissive, and cleave to the
dust, or earth; (S and TA in art. دقع;) or ye
bear poverty ill: (TA in the present art.;) and
when ye are satiated, [ye bear richness ill; or]
ye exult, or exult greatly or excessively, and behave insolently and unthankfully. (S in the present
art.) [See also a verse of El-Kumeyt cited in the
first paragraph of art. دقع.] ―
