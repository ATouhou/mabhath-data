picked it, (Lh, S, K,) namely, a collection of
goods, or commodities, (Lh,) removing from it
what was bad. (Lh, S, K.) ―
-b2-  And خَشَرَ, aor.
(and inf. n., TA) as above, He left upon the table
refuse of food: thus the verb bears two contr.
significations. (K.)
-A2-  Also خَشَرَهُ He rendered
it (a thing) bad, or vile. (TA.)
خُشَارٌ (K) and ↓ خُشَارَةٌ (S, A, K) The bad part
or parts [or the refuse] (Lh, S, K) of goods, or
commodities, (Lh,) or of anything. (S, K.) And
the latter, The worst kind, syn. شِيص, of lates.

K,) and the former, (K,) and ↓ خُشَّارٌ, (IAar,)
(tropical:)  The refuse, or lowest or basest or meanest sort,
of mankind, or of people; (IAar, S, A, K;) as
also ↓ خَاشِرٌ, accord. to the K, but correctly ↓ خَاشِرَةٌ,
as related by AA from IAar. (TA.) El-Hotei-ah
says,
وَبَاعَ بَنِيهِ بَعْضُهُمْ بِخُشَارَةً
وَبِعْتَ لِذُبْيَانَ العَلَآءَ بِمَالِكِ
[And some of them have sold their sons for the
refuse of mankind; but] thou hast purchased
eminence for Dhubyán with Málik: in the S we
find بِمَالِكَا [with thy property]: but it is correctly
as above: Málik was a son of 'Oyeyneh Ibn-
Hisn: the Benoo-'Ámir slew him: wherefore
'Oyeyneh made war upon them, and obtained his
blood-revenge, and spoil: and to this event El-
Hotei-ah refers in the verse above. (IB, TA.)
