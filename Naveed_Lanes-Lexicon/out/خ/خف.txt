خُفٌّ A boot; (KL, PS, &c.;) a certain thing
that is worn (JK, S, Msb, K, TA) upon the
foot: (TA:) pl. خِفَافٌ (S, L, Msb, K) and أَخْفَافٌ
[which is a pl. of pauc.]. (L, TA.) Hence, رَجَعَ
بِخُفَّىْ حُنَيْنٍ [He returned with the two boots
of Honeyn]; a saying which originated thus:
(A 'Obeyd, TA:) an Arab of the desert bargained with Honeyn the إِسْكَاف [or maker of
shoes and boots], (K,) who was of the people of
El-Heereh, (TA,) for a pair of boots, until he
angered him, (K,) and Honeyn desired to anger
the Arab: (TA:) so when the Arab of the desert
departed, Honeyn took one of his two boots and
threw it down in the way, and then he threw
down the other in another place; and when the
Arab passed by one of them, he said, “How
like is this to the boot of Honeyn ! and if the
other were with it, I would take it: ” and he
went on: and when he came to the other, he
repented of having left the former: and Honeyn
had lain in wait for him: therefore when the
Arab went away in search of the former [boot],
Honeyn betook himself to the camel that he rode,
and what was upon it, and went away therewith;
and the Arab came, having with him nothing
but a pair of boots; and it was said, (K,) i. e. his
people said to him, (TA,) “ What hast thou
brought from thy journey? ” and he answered,
جِئْتُكُمْ بِخُفَّىْ حُنَيْنٍ [“ I have brought you the
two boots of Honeyn ”]: and this became a
prov., applied on the occasion of one's despairing
of an object of want, and returning disappointed:
(K:) thus the case is related by A 'Obeyd, and
by most others after him. (TA.) Accord. to ISk,
Honeyn was a strong man, who asserted his relationship to Asad Ibn-Háshim Ibn-'Abd-Menáf,
and came to 'Abd-El-Muttalib, wearing a pair of
red boots, [formerly distinctive of kings and men
of high rank,] and said, “O my paternal uncle,
I am the son of Asad the son of Háshim the son
of 'Abd-Menáf: ” but 'Abd-El-Muttalib said,
“ No, by the garments of my father Háshim, I
know not in thee the natural qualities of Háshim;
therefore return thou: ” so he returned: and it
was said, رَجَعَ حُنَيْنٌ بِخُفَّيْهِ [Honeyn returned
with his pair of boots]. (O, K, &c.) As to the
saying of the rájiz,
يَحْمِلُ فِى سَحْقٍ مِنَ الخِفَافِ
تَوَادِيًا سُوِّينَ مِنْ خِلَافِ
he means thereby [He carries, in] a pastor's bag

light in weight but heavy in price, not incommoding the bearer: (Har p. 139:) and the first and
