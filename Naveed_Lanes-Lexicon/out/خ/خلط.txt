several, objects; or signifies he mixed it much:]

خِلَاطٌ, (S, K,) It mixed, mingled, commingled,

incorporated, or blended, with it; syn. مَازَجَهُ;
(Mgh, K;) and خَامَرَهُ; (S, A, K, all in art. خمر;)
[as, for instance,] water with milk. (A in art.
خمر, and Mgh in the present art.) خِلَاطٌ in relation to camels, and men, and beasts, also signifies Their being mixed together. (K.) A poet
says,
يَخْرُجْنَ مِنْ بُعْكُوكَةِ الخِلَاطِ
[They come forth from the crowding and dust
(of the beasts) occasioned by the being mixed together]. (Th, TA.) And it is said in a trad.,
لَا خِلَاطَ وَلَا وِرَاطَ (S, Mgh,) There shall be no
putting together what is separate, nor separating
what is put together, from fear of the poor-rate:
(S:) for the Prophet made it incumbent on a
person having possessed forty sheep or goats a
whole year to give one sheep or goat; and so on
one having possessed more thereof to the number
of a hundred and twenty, to give one sheep or
goat; but if they exceeded a hundred and twenty
by one, two sheep or goats were to be given of
them: (Az, TA:) i. e. there shall be no putting
together what is separate; as, for instance, when
three persons possess a hundred and twenty sheep
or goats, every one of them having forty, they not
having been partners for a whole year, and it
being incumbent on every one of them to give a
sheep or goat; and when the collector of the poorrate comes to them, they put them together, assigning them to one pastor, in order that they
may not be obliged to give for them more than
one sheep or goat: (K, * TA:) accord. to IAth,
this is termed إِخْلَاطٌ [app. a mistake for خِلَاطٌ]:
nor shall there be any separating of what is put
together; i. e., when there are two partners, each
of them having a hundred and one sheep or goats,
for which together they are bound to give three
sheep or goats; and when the collector of the poorrate comes to them, they separate their sheep or
goats, so that each of them shall not have to give
more than one sheep or goat: [see also art. ورط:]
(TA:) or خلاط signifies a man's mixing his
sheep or goats when they are eighty in number
with those of another which are forty in number,
both together being bound to give two sheep or
goats while they are separate, in order that one
[only] may be taken: and وراط, a man's giving to
another the half of his sheep or goats when they
are forty in number, in order that the collector of
the poor-rate may not take anything: (Mgh:)
or خلاط is, when there are, between two partners,
a hundred and twenty sheep or goats, one of them
having eighty and the other forty, and the collector of the poor-rate has taken two of these sheep
or goats, the former partner's restoring to the
latter the third of a sheep or goat; so that the
former has had to give a sheep or goat and a
third; and the latter, two thirds of one: and if
the collector have taken, from the hundred and
twenty, one sheep or goat, the former partner's
restoring to the latter one third [in some copies
of the K, erroneously, two thirds] of a sheep or
goat; so that the former has had to give two
thirds of a sheep or goat; and the latter, one
third of one: (ISd, K, * TA:) and وراط is deceiving, and acting dishonestly: (ISd, L, TA:) in
the place of وراط, we find, accord. to one relation,
شِنَاق, followed by فِى الصَّدَقَةِ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  El-

shaggy hair]; to which El-'Ajjáj replied, الفِجَاجُ

مُنَادِمٌ, and جَلِيسٌ with مُجَالِسٌ: (S:) pl. خُلَطَآءُ
(S, Msb, K) and خُلُطٌ: (S, K:) it sometimes has
these pls., but is itself both sing. and pl.: (S,
TA:) and as a pl. signifies (assumed tropical:)  a people, or company of men, whose affair, or case, or state, is
one: (K, TA:) it occurs frequently in the poems
of the Arabs because they used to assemble in the
days of the fresh herbage, sundry tribes of them
congregating in one place, and familiar intercourse
took place between them, and when they separated and returned to their homes, it grieved

only to partnership: (TA:) it signifies (assumed tropical:)  a partner,
copartner, or sharer; (Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) as,
for instance, in merchandise, and sheep or goats:
(Mgh:) or (assumed tropical:)  one who has mixed his property

or (assumed tropical:)  one who shares in merchandise, or in a debt,
or in commerce, or in neighbourship: (Ibn-

sing. also signifies (assumed tropical:)  a neighbour; syn. جَارٌ [which
has also other significations here assigned to
خَلِيطٌ]; (TA;) and مُجَاوِرٌ: (Msb:) and (assumed tropical:)  a
husband: and (assumed tropical:)  the son of a paternal uncle: (K:)
and [the pl.] خُلُطٌ is also explained by IAar as
(assumed tropical:)  i. q. مَوَالٍ [pl. of مَوْلًى, which has several of the
significations here assigned to خَلِيطٌ]: and as
signifying also (assumed tropical:)  neighbours of sincere friendly
conduct. (TA.) It is said in a trad. (K, TA)
respecting [the right termed] الشُّفْعَة, (TA,)
الشَّرِيكُ أَوْلَى مِنَ الخَلِيطُ أَوْلَى مِنَ الجَارِ
(assumed tropical:)  The sharer in what is not divided is more deserving than the sharer in the rights of possession,
or property; [and the sharer in the rights of
possession, or property, is more deserving than
the neighbour:] (K, TA:) [or the trad. is as
follows:] الخَلِيطُ مِنَ الشَّرِيكِ وَالشَّرِيكُ أَحَقُّ
مِنَ الجَارِ أَحَقُّ مِنْ غَيْرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  the sharer in the
thing itself that is sold has more right than the
sharer in the rights thereof; and the sharer in
the rights thereof has more right than the adjoining neighbour; and the adjoining neighbour
has more right than another: or the meaning
here is, he between whom and thyself are acts of
receiving and giving, and affairs of debt and
credit; not the sharer, or partner. (Mgh.) And
in another trad., مَا كَانَ مِنْ خَلِيطَيْنِ فَإإِنَّهُمَا
يَتَرَاجَعَانِ بَيْنَهُمَا بِالسَّوِيَّةِ (assumed tropical:)  Whatever two copartners
there be that have not divided the beasts [belonging
to them], they shall make claim for restitution,
one of the other, with equality; i. e., if they be
copartners in camels for which it is incumbent to
give sheep or goats, and the camels be found in
the possession of one of them, and the poor-rate
for them be taken from him, he shall make a
claim for restitution [of what he has given above
his own share] upon his copartner, with equality:
(Esh-Sháfi'ee, K, TA:) the two persons are not
خَلِيطَانِ unless they be such as drive back their
beasts to the nightly resting-place, and drive them
forth in the morning to the pasturage, and water
them, together, and have their stallions mixed
together, and have been copartners for a year;
and if so, they give the poor-rate as one: otherwise, they are not خليطان; and they give the
poor-rate as two: (Esh-Sháfi'ee, TA:) the trad.
applies, for instance, to the case of two copartners
who have mixed their property together; one of
them having forty bulls or cows or of both kinds;
and the other, thirty; and the collector of the
poor-rates takes from the forty a مُسِنَّة [q. v.], and
from the thirty a تَبِيع [q. v.]; then the giver of
the مسنّة makes a claim for restitution of three
sevenths thereof upon his copartner; and the
giver of the تبيع, of four sevenths thereof upon
his copartner; for it is incumbent to give the beasts
of these two ages [the مسنّة and the تبيع] when
the property is not divided, as though it were the
property of one: and the saying بالسّوية shows
that if the collector of the poor-rate wrong one of
them, and take from him more than the law imposes upon him, he cannot make a claim for
restitution thereof upon his copartner, who is only
responsible to him for the value of what falls upon
him in particular, of what is incumbent by the
law: and the making claim for [just] restitution,
by one upon the other, shows that the partnership
holds good notwithstanding the distinction of the
things which compose the possessions, with such
as hold this to be the case. (IAth, TA.)
خَلَاطَةٌ (tropical:)  Stupidity; foolishness; paucity of
sense. (IAar, K.)
خَلِيطَةٌ Camel's milk milked upon that of sheep
or goats: or sheep's milk upon that of goats: and
the reverse. (K.)
