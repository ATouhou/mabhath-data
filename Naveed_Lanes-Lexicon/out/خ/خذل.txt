[iii. 154], وَ إِنْ يَخْذُلْكُمْ فَمَنْ ذَا الَّذِى يَنْصُرُكُمْ مِنْ
بَعْدِهِ [But if He fail to aid you, or to preserve
you, then who is he that will aid you after

(a wild animal, S, O, or a gazelle, K) remained
attending to her young one [when the rest of the

the one that leaves, but] the one that is left;
