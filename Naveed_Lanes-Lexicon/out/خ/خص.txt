خَصَّهُ بِالشَّىْءِ, (S, K,) or بِكَذَا, (A, Msb,)
aor.
خَصُ3َ, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. خَصٌّ (K) and خُصُوصٌ
(S, Msb, K) and خَصُوصٌ (TA) and خَصُوصِيَّةٌ
and خُصُوصِيَّةٌ, (S, Mgh, * Msb, K,) of which last
two the former is the more chaste, (S, TA,) and
is the form mentioned in the Fs and its Exposi
tions, and the ى in it is said to be the relative
ى, and the ى which is characteristic of an inf. n.,
whereas in the latter it is said to be a characteristic
of intensiveness, but MF thinks that this requires
consideration, because the ى is also said to be,
and by some more commonly, without teshdeed,
as in كَرَاهِيَةٌ and عَلَانِيَةٌ, (TA,) and خِصِّيصَى, (S,
K,) like مِكِّيثَى, which is said to be the only other
instance of this measure, (TA,) [but some others
might be added, as دِلِّيلَى and فِخِّيرَى and قِتِّيتَى,]
and خِصِّيصَآءُ, (IAar, Kr, K,) [like مِكِّيثَآءُ,] the
former of which last two [each of which has an
intensive signification] is the chaste, and com
monly known, form, (TA,) and خُصِّيَّةٌ, or خِصِّيَّةٌ,
or خَصِيَّةٌ, (accord. to different copies of the K,)
written by Sgh with damm, (TA,) and تَخِصَّةٌ,
(Ibn-' Abbád, K,) or, as some say, خَصُوصِيَّةٌ and
خِصِّيَّةٌ [or خُصِّيَّةٌ or خَصِّيَّةٌ] are each a quasi-inf. n.,
as also خَاصَّةٌ, (TA,) He distinguished him particularly, peculiarly, or specially, i. e., above, or
from, or exclusively of, others, by the thing, or
by such a thing; he particularized him, or particularly or peculiarly or specially characterized
him, thereby; syn. فَضَّلَهُ (A, K, TA) دُونَ غَيْرِهِ,
and مَيَّزَهُ; (TA;) he appropriated, or assigned,
[the thing or] such a thing, or made it to belong,
to him alone, or in particular, or peculiarly, or
specially, exclusively of others; (Msb;) and
بِهِ ↓ اختصّهُ signifies the same; (S, A, Msb, K;)
as also ↓ اخصّهُ, (A, [but for this I know not any
other authority,]) and ↓ خصّصهُ; (A;) or this last
has an intensive signification. (Msb.) You say,
خَصَّهُ بِالُودِّ He distinguished him &c. by love, or
affection; or favoured him in preference to
another, or others, thereby. (K, TA.) As to the
saying of AZ,
إِنِ امْرَأٌ خَصَّنِى عَمْدًا مَوَدَّتَهُ
عَلَى التَّنَانِى لَعِنْدِى غَيْرُ مَكْفُورِ
[If a man distinguish me above, or from, or exclusively of, others, purposely, by his love, or because of his love of me, notwithstanding distance
of each from the other, it will not be disacknowledged with me,] the meaning is, خَصَّنِى بِمَوَدَّتِهِ;
or it may be خَصَّنِى لِمَوَدَّتِهِ إِيَّاىَ [in the TA
بِمَوَدَّتِهِ, which is evidently a mistranscription];
for, says ISd, we have not heard خَصَّهُ [or rather
خَصَّ] doubly transitive. (TA.) And [hence]
خَصَّهُ بِكَذَا also signifies He gave him such a thing
in large quantity, or abundantly. (TA.) [You
say also, خَصَّهُ بِالذِّكْرِ He distinguished, &c., or
singled out, him, or it, by mention: or he particularized, peculiarized, or specified, him, or it,
thereby; he particularly, peculiarly, or specially,
mentioned him, or it. And خَصَّهُ, alone, He pointed
particularly, or peculiarly, to him, or it, in what
he said; or he meant particularly, or peculiarly,
him, or it. And خَصَّ مِنْهُ كَذَا He distinguished,
particularized, peculiarized, or specified, thereof
such a thing: and he distinguished therefrom
such a thing; he particularly, peculiarly, or
specially, excepted therefrom such a thing.] You
also say, خَصَّهُ لِنَفْسِهِ (TA) and لِنَفْسِهِ ↓ اختصّهُ (T,
A, TA) [He appropriated, or took, or chose, him,
or it, particularly, or specially, to, or for, himself; as also خَصَّ بِهِ نَفْسَهُ and بِهِ نَفْسَهُ ↓ اختصّ].
And فُلَانًا ↓ هُوَ يَسْتَخِصُّ and يَسْتَخْلِصُهُ (A, TA) [He
appropriates such a one purely to himself, exclusively of any partner; (see the latter verb;)] he
chooses such a one for himself; he appropriates
him to himself as his particular, or special, intimate; (TA in art. خلص;) both signify the
same. (S and K in art. خلص.) [And ↓ اختصّهُ
He treated him, or behaved towards him, with
partiality; was partial towards him: a signification implied by the first explanation in this art.:
and in this sense it is often used.]
-A2-  خَصَّ, aor.

of خَصَّهُ بِهِ; (A, Msb, K;) He was, or became,
distinguished particularly, peculiarly, or specially,
i. e., above, or from, or exclusively of, others, by

he had [the thing or] such a thing appropriated,
or assigned, or made to belong, to him alone, or

the same. (A, Msb, K.) You say, اختصّ فُلَانٌ

usage,] Such a one was, or became, alone, with

one sees what is in it through its خَصَاص, or “ interstices: ” (TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَخْصَاصٌ (JK,

(JK, K) and خُصُوصَةٌ. (JK.) ―

خَصَاصٌ: see خَصَاصَةٌ, from the beginning to
the last sentence but two.
خُصُوصٌ an inf. n. of 1, trans. and intrans. ―
-b2-
[Used as a simple subst., Particularity; peculiarity; speciality, or specialty; as also the inf. ns.
↓ خَصُوصِيَّةٌ, and ↓ خُصُوصِيَّةٌ.] You say, لَهُ خُصُوصٌ
and ↓ خُصُوصِيَّةٌ [To him belongs a particularity,
&c.], and بِى [in me is &c.]. (A.) [Hence
خُصُوصًا Particularly; specially; as also ↓ خَاصَّةً.]
Th was heard to say, ↓ إِذَا ذُكِرَ الصَّالِحُونَ فَبَخَاصَّةٍ
أَبُو بَكْرٍ وَإِذَا ذُكِرَ الأَشْرَافُ فَبِخَاصَّةٍ عَلِىٌّ [meaning
فَخُصُوصًا, i. e., When the righteous are mentioned,
then in particular, or peculiarly, Aboo-Bekr is
virtually mentioned; and when the shereefs are
mentioned, then in particular, or peculiarly,
'Alee]. (L, TA.)
خَصَاصَةٌ An interstice, interval, or intervening
space or opening; (S, K;) as also ↓ خَصَاصٌ
[which is commonly used as a coll. gen. n.] and
↓ خَصَاصَآءُ: (K:) or an interstice, &c., in the
ثَغْر [app. meaning the front teeth]; as also ↓ the
second of these words: (TA:) or the first and
↓ second, (TA,) or ↓ all, (K,) any interstice, &c.,
or hole or perforation, in a door, and sieve, and
[veil of the kind called] بُرْقُع, and the like, (K,
TA,) such as a cloud, and a strainer, &c.: (TA:)
[a crevice, cranny, chink, or fissure:] or the first,
(TA,) or ↓ all, (K,) a small hole or perforation:
(K, TA:) or the first has this signification as
well as the signification first mentioned: (S:)
or the ↓ second, the like of a كَوَّة [or mural aperture] in a [structure of the kind called] قُبَّة, or
the like, when as wide as the face; or, accord. to
some, whether wide or narrow: (TA:) and the
same, interstices, intervals, or intervening spaces
or openings, in a خُصّ; (TA;) or narrow interstices, &c., therein: (T, TA:) and the same,
(TA,) or ↓ all, (K,) the intervening spaces between
the three stones upon which a cooking-pot is placed;
(K, TA;) and between the fingers: (TA:) and

and ↓ third, (IDrd, K,) (tropical:)  Poverty; (S, Mgh,
Msb, K;) need; (A, Msb, TA;) straitness, or
difficulty; (Mgh;) an evil state or condition:
(TA:) from خَصَاصَات meaning the “ holes ” of a
sieve: whence a saying cited voce تَجَمَّلَ:
(Mgh:) or from the first of the senses explained
in this paragraph; because a thing, when it opens
so as to form an interstice, becomes weak and
unsound. (TA.) You say also, ↓ سَدَدْتُ خُصَاصَةَ
فُلَانٍ, with damm, meaning, (tropical:)  I repaired the
broken fortune of such a one. (A, TA.) ―

خُصَاصَةٌ: see خَصَاصَةٌ, last sentence but one.
خَصَاصَآءُ: see خَصَاصَةٌ, from the beginning to

خَصوُصِيَّةٌ and خُصُوصِيَّةٌ: see خُصُوصٌ, in three
places.
خِصَّانٌ and خُصَّانٌ: see the next paragraph, in
three places.
خَاصٌّ Particular; peculiar; special; distinct,
or distinguished, from others; contr. of عَامٌّ.
(Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  [And hence, Choice; select. ―
-b3-
And Pare; unmixed; unadulterated.] ―
-b4-  [Used
as a subst.,] it is syn. with ↓ خَاصَّةٌ; (Ks, Msb,
K;) in which the ة is a corroborative; (Msb;)
and which signifies Distinguished people; persons of distinction; the distinguished sort; contr.
of عَامَّةٌ: (S, Msb, K:) or the former is contr.
of عَامٌّ, and ↓ the latter is contr. of عَامَّةٌ: (TA:)
[the pl. of both is خَوَاصٌّ and ↓ خِصَّانٌ and ↓ خُصَّانٌ:
or, accord. to rule, the first of these is pl. only of
خَاصَّةٌ; and judging from other instances, we
should regard the second and third as more probably pls. of خَاصٌّ: but however the case may
be,] خِصَّانٌ is syn. with خَوَاصُّ, (S, K,) and so is
خُصَّانٌ. (K.) [You say, الخَاصُّ وَالعَامُّ, and
وَالعَمَّةُ ↓ الخَاصَّةُ, The distinguished and the common people; the persons of distinction and the
vulgar.] You also say, ↓ إِنَّمَا يَفْعَلُ هٰذَا خِصَّانٌ
مِنَ النَّاسِ meaning خَوَاصُّ مِنْهُمْ [Only distinguished persons of mankind do this]. (S.) ―
-b5-  [It
seems to be also, in some instances, syn. with
↓ خَاصَّةٌ as signifying A particular, peculiar, or
special, friend, intimate, familiar, companion,
associate, attendant, dependent, or servant:] the
latter is explained in the T [and JK] as meaning
a person whom thou hast appropriated, particularly distinguished, taken, or chosen, (اِخْتَصَصْتَهُ,)
[as a friend, &c.,] to, or for, thyself: (TA:)
[and it is used as a sing. and as a pl.: for] you
say, هٰذَا خَاصَّتِى [This is my particular, or special, or choice, or choicest, friend, &c.]: and
هُمْ خَاصَّتِى [They are my particular, or peculiar,
or special, or choice, or choicest, friends, &c.].
(A.) You say also, فُلَانٌ خَاصٌّ لِفُلَانٍ, (Kull
p. 174,) or بِفُلَانٍ, (so in the L,) [app. meaning
لِفُلَانٍ, unless it be mistranscribed, and the latter
be the correct reading, which I think much the
more probable;] i. e., Such a one belongs exclusively [as a particular, or peculiar, or special,
friend, &c.,] to such a one; (Kull;) and ↓ مُخَصٌّ
signifies the same. (L.) ―
-b6-  See the dim. of خَاصَّةٌ,
(namely خُوَيْصَّةٌ,) below.
خَاصَّةٌ: see خَاصٌّ, in four places. ―
-b2-  It also
signifies A property of a thing, not found, or not
existing, either wholly or partly, in another
thing: and ↓ خَاصِّيَّةٌ [thus correctly written, and
thus I have always found it written except by
Golius and those who have probably imitated
him, who write it without the sheddeh to the ى,]
is used as denoting [a property, or particular
or peculiar virtue, which is] an unknown cause of
a known effect; as that by which a medicine operates: the former differs from the latter in being
conventionally applied to an effect, [or effective
property,] whether the cause of its existence be
known or not: [the pl. of the former is خَوَاصُّ,
agreeably with analogy and usage, like as عَوَامُّ
is pl. of عَامَّةٌ:] the pl. of the latter is خَاصِّيَّاتٌ
[and خَصَائِصُ]; and خَوَاصُّ is a quasi-pl. n., not
a pl., of the same. (Kull p. 174. [All the abovementioned words here cited from that work are
there without syll. signs, as being well known.
Both خاصّة and ↓ خاصّيّة, as here explained, are
perhaps post-classical; but of this I am not certain: and both are sometimes used as meaning
The peculiar nature of a thing; also termed its
essence.]) ―
-b3-  خَاصَّةً and بِخَاصَّةٍ: see خُصُوصٌ.
خَاصِّيَّةٌ: see خَاصَّةٌ, in two places.
خُوَيْصَّةٌ dim. of خَاصَّةٌ; (A, K;) [like دُوَيْبَّةٌ,
q. v., dim. of دَابَّةٌ;] originally خُوَيْصِصَةٌ; (TA;)
the ى being quiescent because the ى of the dim.
cannot be movent; (A, K;) [properly signifying
A little, or young, particular, or peculiar, or
special, friend, companion, associate, attendant,
or servant; and used in other senses, like other
diminutives; implying littleness of estimation;
and also affection, and awe.] It is said in a trad.,
(TA,) عَلَيْكَ بِخُوَيْصَّةِ نَفْسِكَ [Keep thou to the
little, or dear, particular friend of thine own self:
so it seems to mean accord. to Z, being mentioned
by him among the proper expressions belonging
to this art.: but accord. to the TK, it appears to
be tropical; for the meaning is there said to be,
(assumed tropical:)  thine own particular state, or condition]. (A,
TA.) In another trad., خويصّة is used as signifying A little, young, particular, or peculiar, or
special, servant. (TA.) And in another trad. it is
said, بَادِرُوا بِالأَعْمَالِ سِتًّا الدَّجَّالِ وَكَذَا وَكَذَا
وَخُوَيْصَّةَ أَحَدِكُمْ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Strive ye to be before
six things with [good] works; Antichrist, and
such and such things, and the event of death which
is specially, or peculiarly, appointed to any one of
you: [or, I would rather say, the awful special
awaiter of any one of you; though it is asserted
that] the diminutive form is here used to denote
low estimation of that which it signifies in comparison with what follows it, namely, the resurrection, &c. (TA.)
مُخَصٌّ: see خَاصٌّ, last sentence but one.
