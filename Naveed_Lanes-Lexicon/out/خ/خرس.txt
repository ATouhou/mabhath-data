see أَخْرَسُ:] or he was, or became, tonguetied, or

for child-birth for thyself, O self: there is no
maker of it for thee: said by a woman who had

also the sense of خُرْسَةٌ. (TA.) ―

↓ the second word, A feast, or banquet, that is prepared on that occasion, and to which people are
invited: so in a trad. of Hassán, كَانَ إِذَا دُعِىَ إِلَى
طَعَامٍ قَالَ إِلَى عُرْسٍ أَمْ خُرْسٍ أَمْ إِعْذَارٍ [He used,
when he was invited to food, to say, To a weddingfeast, or a feast for child-birth, or a circumcisionfeast?]; and if it were for one of these, he consented: but if not, he did not consent. (TA.)
