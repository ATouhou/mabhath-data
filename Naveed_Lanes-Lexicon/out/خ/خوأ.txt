خوأخَآءٌ The name of the letter خ, q. v.; as also
خَا: [it is called خَا in a case of pause, and خَآءٌ
when made a noun:] it is fem. and masc.: [its
dim. is خَيَيَّةٌ, meaning a خ written small, or indistinct: (see حَآءٌ in art. حوأ:)] and its pl. is
أَخْوَآءٌ and أَخْيَآءٌ and خَاآتٌ. (TA in باب الالف
الليّنة.)
خَآءِ بِكَ عَلَيْنَا, (AZ * and S * and TA in باب
الالف الليّنة, and K and TA in the present art.,)
in which خَآءِ is a صَوْت [or noun significant of a
sound], indecl., with kesr for its termination;
(S, TA;) and خَائِى بك, as in the Book of the
Nawádir by Ibn-Háni, (Az, TA,) in which latter,
ISd says, the ى is not for a sign of the fem.
gender, because the word is a صوت; and, as Sh
says, on the authority of A'Obeyd, خَائِبِكَ; but
correctly written as in the Book of Ibn-Háni;
(Az, TA;) Hasten thou [to us]: (AZ, Az, S, K,
TA:) it is also used in addressing a female, and
two persons, and a pl. number: (S, TA:) you
say [خَآءِ بِكِ, and] خَائِى بِكِ; and خآءِ بِكُمَا, and
خَائِى بِكُمَا; and [خَآءِ بِكُمْ, and] خَائِى بِكُمْ. (TA.)
In the saying of El-Kumeyt,
بِخَائِى بِكَ الْحَقْ يَهْتِفُونَ وَحَىَّ هَلْ
[which app. means Calling out “ Hasten thou,
come up with us,” and “ Come,” or “ come
quickly,  ” &c.,] it is held by Ibn-Selemeh to be
used as an imprecation, meaning خِبْتَ [mayest
thou be disappointed of attaining that which thou
desirest]; the poet saying بِخَائِبِكَ for بِأَمْرِكَ الَّذِى
خَابَ وَخَسِرَ [meaning By thine affair that shall
result in disappointment, and be an occasion of
loss]: which, as you see, is at variance with the
explanation of AZ. (S, TA.)
خَائِىٌّ and خَاوِىٌّ and خَوِىٌّ [a mistranscription
for خَيَوِىٌّ, like بَيَوِىٌّ and تَيَوِىٌّ] rel. ns. of خَآءٌ
and خَا the names of the letter خ. (TA in باب
الالف اللّينة.)
