خضب1
خَضَبَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.
خَضِبَ, (Msb, K,)
inf. n. خَضْبٌ (S, Msb) [and accord. to MF
خِضَابٌ and خُضُوبٌ, but respecting these two
inf. ns. (the latter of which seems to be peculiar
to the intrans. verb خَضَبَ) see what follows],
He coloured, or tinged, (A, K,) a thing; (S, A, *
K; *) or changed it in colour to red, or yellow,
&c.; (TA;) and ↓ خضّب signifies the same, [but
app. in an intensive sense, or as applying to a
number of objects, (see its pass. part. n. voce
خَضِيبٌ,)] (K,) inf. n. تَخْضِيبٌ: (TA:) and the
former, particularly, he tinged, or dyed, his white
hair, (TA,) or the hand, &c., (Msb,) with hinnà:
(Msb, TA:) but when a man has dyed his hair
with any other dye than hinnà, you say, صَبَغَ
شَعَرَهُ: (Msb, TA:) or you say also, خَضَبَ بِالسَّوَادِ
[He dyed his hair with black]. (Suh, TA.)
When one does not mention the hair (Msb, TA)
or the white hair [&c.], (Msb,) he says خَضَبَ,
inf. n. خِضَابٌ; (IKtt, Msb;) and ↓ اختضب, (S,
IKtt, Msb, TA,) and ↓ تخضّب; (A, TA;)
[meaning He dyed his hair, &c.,] with hinnà,
(S, IKtt, Msb, TA,) and the like: (S, TA:) and
in like manner one says of a woman, خَضَبَتْ,
aor.
خَضِبَ; and ↓ اختضب: (TA:) which last also
signifies [particularly] She dyed her hands with
hinnà. (T, TS, TA, in art. غمس.) ―
-b2-  Hence, in
a trad., بَكَى حَتَّى خَضَبَ دَمْعُهُ الحَصَى (tropical:)  He wept
so that his tears wetted the pebbles: or, more
probably, so that his tears became red, and dyed
the pebbles: (IAth, TA:) [or most probably, so
that his tears caused the pebbles to appear of a
reddish colour; for such is commonly the case
when pebbles are wetted.]
-A2-  خَضَبَ, aor.
خَضِبَ; and
خَضِبَ, aor.
خَضَبَ; and خُضِبَ; inf. n. of each
خُضُوبٌ; and ↓ اخضوضب; (tropical:)  It (a tree) became
green. (K, TA.) And خَضَبَ, inf. n. خُضُوبٌ,
(assumed tropical:)  Its small leaves came forth in the spring, and
its twigs lengthened; said of the قَتَاد, at the commencement of its vegetation; and likewise of the
عَرْفَج and عَوْسَج; but of no other tree of the kind
called عِضَاه: or said also of the عُرْفُط and سَمُر;
meaning (assumed tropical:)  it dropped its leaves, and became red
and yellow: (TA:) and you say also, خَضَبَتِ
العِضَاهُ (tropical:)  the عضاه became green, and broke forth;
(A;) or the sap of the عضاه flowed in their
branches, and they became green; as also
↓ أَخْضَبَتْ, (TA,) for which اخصبت, with the
unpointed ص, is said by Az to be a gross mistranscription; explained by Lth, on whose authority it is written with ص, [as also in the K
in art. خصب,] as meaning the sap flowed in the
branches of the عضاه so as to reach the roots.
(T and TA in art. خصب.) And خَصَبَ النَّخْلُ,
(S, K,) inf. n. خَضْبٌ, (K,) The palm-trees, (S,)
or the spadices of the palm-trees, (K,) became
green. (S, K.) And خَضَبَتِ الأَرْضُ, (A, K,)
inf. n. خَضْبٌ; (TA;) and ↓ اخضبت, (K,) inf. n.
إِخْضَابٌ; (TA;) or ↓ اختضبت; and ↓ تخضّبت;
(A;) The earth, or land, exposed to view, (A,)
or produced, (K,) its herbage, (A, K,) and it
(the latter) became green. (TA.)

خَضْبٌ The colour of a tree, or of the spadix
of a palm-tree, when it becomes green: pl.
خُضُوبٌ. (K.) ―
-b2-  A plant fresh, or new, and
green in consequence of rain; as also ↓ خَضُوبٌ:
(K:) or watered by rain, and imparting a colour
to the ordure: (TA:) or the green colour that
appears in trees when they begin to put forth
their leaves: (K:) pl. خُضُوبٌ. (TA.)
خَضْبَةٌ A spadix of a palm-tree: خَصْبَةٌ, [q. v.,]
with the unpointed ص, is erroneously said to have
this signification. (TA.)
خُضَبَةٌ A woman who uses خِضَاب for herself
[i. e. for dyeing her hair or hands &c.] much, or
often. (S, A, K.)
خِضَابٌ Hinnà (حِنَّآء), and the like: (Msb:)
or the thing with which one dyes, or tinges, his,
or her, hair &c.; (S, K, TA;) such as حِنَّآء and
كَتَم and the like. (TA.)
خَضُوبٌ: see خَضْبٌ.
خَضِيبٌ Anything dyed, tinged, or changed
in colour; [generally, with hinnà;] as also
↓ مَخْضُوبٌ: the former is both masc. and fem.:
and its pl. is خُضُبٌ. (TA.) You say كَفٌّ خَضِيبٌ
(S, A, K) and ↓ خَاضِبٌ (TA voce ضَارِبٌ) [A hand
dyed with hinnà]: and بَنَانٌ خَضِيبٌ and ↓ مَخْضُوبٌ
(K) and ↓ مُخَضَّبٌ (S, A, K) [fingers, or fingers'
ends, dyed with hinnà]; but the last of these has
an intensive signification. (S.) ―
-b2-  And hence,
(TA,) الكَفُّ الخَضِيبُ (assumed tropical:)  A certain star; (S, A,
K;) the star
β of Cassiopeia; (so in the Egyptian
almanacs;) [i. e.] the bright star of the constel-lation called ذَاتُ الكُرْسِىِّ; which star is [termed]
the extended right hand of الثُّرَيَّا [or the Pleiades;
corresponding to the star called الكَفُّ الجَذْمَآءُ].
(Kzw. [See أَجْذَمُ.]) ―
-b3-  And اِمْرَأَةٌ خَضِيبٌ [A
woman having her hands, or feet, or hair, &c.,
dyed with hinnà or the like]. (K.)
خَاضِبٌ A man dyeing, or who dyes, his hair
with hinnà. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  See also خَضِيبٌ. ―
-b3-  Also
(tropical:)  A male ostrich (S, A, K, &c.) whose shanks
(A, K) and legs (A) have become red, (A, K,) or
green, [app. meaning of a dark, or an ashy, dustcolour,] or yellow, (A,) in consequence of his
lusting after the female, (A, K,) or in consequence
of his having eaten the [herbage termed] رَبِيع:
(A:) or the front edges of whose shanks have become red, (S, K,) or green, (K,) or yellow, in
consequence of his having eaten the [herbage
termed] ربيع: (S, K:) or whose beak and shanks
have become red from his having eaten the [herbage termed] ربيع: in the summer (الصَّيْف) he
becomes bald (يقرع), and his shanks become
white: (L:) or whose shanks have become green
by reason of lust in the [season termed] ربيع:
(ADk:) accord. to some, (TA,) it is applied
only to the male ostrich: (S, K:) but some explain it without this restriction; and Lth mentions
[the fem.] خَاضِبَةٌ as applied to an ostrich: [it is
said that] the skin of the neck, and that of the
breast, and that of the thighs, of the male ostrich,
but not his feathers, become intensely red when
he lusts after the female: or, as some say, خاضب
signifies an ostrich that has eaten green food:
(TA:) or the extremities of whose feathers are
dyed by [the eating of] blossoms, and the slender
parts of whose legs have become red by the same
cause: accord. to an Arab of the desert, supposed
to be Aboo-Kheyreh, in the [season termed]
ربيع, when it eats أَسَارِيع [app. meaning certain
worms so called], its legs and beak assume the
red hue of the عُصْفُر [or safflower]: (AHn, L:)
or خاضب is applied to a male ostrich the slender
parts of whose legs become red when the dates
begin to become red, and cease to be so when the
redness of the dates ceases: (AHn, K:) so that
it is not from eating اساريع, which, it is said, no
ostrich is known to eat: accord. to As, the cause
[of the redness above mentioned] is only the dye
of blossoms; but were it so, the bird would also
become yellow, and green, &c., [and some assert
that it partially does, as has been shown above,]
accord. to the colours of the blossoms and herbs;
and the green colour would predominate: [but,
as the Arabs say, this requires consideration:]
whatever be the cause, the bird, it is said, is
termed خاضب on account of the redness that affects its shanks: and this word is [said to be] an
epithet used as a proper name of the bird: (AHn,
L:) but this is a mistake, unless it mean that,
because of its prevailing application, it is used in
the same manner as الحٰرِثُ and العَبَّاسُ, not that
it may be used [in a determinate sense] without
the article ال: (L:) the pl. is خَوَاضِبُ. (TA.)
It is also said to be applied as an epithet to Any
animal that eats خَضْب [q. v.]: (TA:) and particularly to [the species of bovine antelope called]
the wild bull (الثَّوْرُ الوَحْشِىُّ). (L.) ―
-b4-  [See also
a saying of Dukeyn cited voce رَاوُوقٌ.]
مِخْضَبٌ I. q. مِرْكَنٌ, (S, K,) or إِجَّانَةٌ: (A:)
or a vessel resembling that called إِجَّانَةٌ, in which
clothes are washed. (TA.) ―
-b2-  مَخَاضِبُ [is its pl.;
and also] signifies The rags of the خِضَاب [or
hudot;innà or the like]: (A:) [or] of the حيض [or
catamenia]. (TA.) [If these two significations
be correct, the latter is app. tropical: but حيض
may be a mistranscription for خضاب.]
مُخَضَّبٌ: see خَضِيبٌ.
مَخْضُوبٌ: see خَضِيبٌ, in two places.
