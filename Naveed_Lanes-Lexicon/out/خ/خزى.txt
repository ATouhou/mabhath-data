disgrace, or ignominy: so in the Kur v. 37
[&c.]: (Sh, TA:) or its primary signification is

and Bd and the Ksh: (MF, TA:) or the manifesting foul actions or qualities, for the manifesting of which one deserves punishment: (El-
Harállee, TA:) or خَزِىَ signifies he became disgraced, and was confounded, or perplexed, by

خَازَانِى, inf. n. مُخَازَاةٌ, He vied, or contended, with me in mutual abasing; or rendering base, abject, vile, despicable, or ignominious.
(TK.) You say, ↓ خَازَانِى فَخَزَيْتُهُ, (Ks, JK, S,
K,) aor. of the latter أَخْزِيهِ, (Ks, JK, S,) [inf. n.
app. خَزْىٌ,] I vied, or contended, with him (JK,
TK) in mutual abasing, &c., (TK,) and I surpassed, or overcame, him [therein]: (JK:) [or
it may signify, in abasement, &c.; for] the meaning [of the latter verb with its pronoun] is كُنْتُ
أَشَدَّ خَزْيًا مِنْهُ. (K: in the CK, خِزْيًا: but in a
MS copy of the K, خِزْيًا.)

اخزاهُ He (God) abased him; or rendered
him base, abject, vile, despicable, or ignominious:
or may He abase him; &c.: (S, Msb:) or He
disgraced him, or put him to shame: or may He
disgrace him, &c. (K.) Hence, in the Kur
[xi. 80], the saying of Lot to his people, وَلَا
تُخْزُونِ فِى ضَيْفِى (TA) And disgrace ye not me
in respect of my guests: (Bd, Jel, TA:) or make
not me ashamed &c. (Bd.) One says also, of
him who has done or said that which is approved,
مَالَهُ أخْزَاهُ اللّٰهُ [What aileth him? May God
abase him, or disgrace him!]; and so without
ما له: (K:) it is like مَا لَهُ قَاتَلَهُ اللّٰهُ, said of a
man whose action pleases: (S in art. نفر:) it is
used in lieu of praise, to charm a person against
the evil eye; and means a prayer for him, not an
imprecation against him. (TA.) See also مُخْزٍ,
below. ―
-b2-  Also He made him to be ashamed for
himself (Ham pp. 114 and 397, and TA) in
respect of him, for his shortcoming. (TA.) [See
the citation from the Kur above.] ―
-b3-  He compelled him, or constrained him, to admit an evidence, or a proof, whereby he abased him, or disgraced him. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And He aided him in,
and made him to keep to, a مَخْزَاة [i. e. a thing
that was a cause of shame, or of abasement or disgrace]. (TA.)
