خرت1
خَرَتَ, (K,) aor.
خَرُتَ, inf. n. خَرْتٌ, (TK,) He
perforated, bored, or pierced, (K,) the ear, (TK,)
or a thing. (TA.) And خَرَتَ أَنْفَ الجَمَلِ [It perforated, or slit, (see the pass. part. n., below,)
the nose of the camel]: said of the خِشَاش [or
wooden thing that is inserted in the bone of the
camel's nose]. (A.)
-A2-  خَرَتْنَا الأَرْضَ We knew
the land and its roads. (Ks, S.) [Golius omits
this; but mentions, as on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof, خَرِتَ, signifying He was skilful, or
expert, in showing the way. What Ibn-Maaroof
says, however, is that the inf. n. خَرَتٌ signifies
the being acquainted with a road; and, with a
place. See خِرِّيتُ.]
خَرْتٌ: see what next follows, in two places.
خُرْتٌ The perforation, bore, or hole, (S, A, K,)
of a needle; [i. e. its eye;] (S, A; [see also
خُرْتَةٌ;] and of the ear, (S,) or in the ear, [but
see خُرْتَةٌ,] &c.; (A, K;) and of the فَأْس, [i. e.
hoe, or adz, or axe,] (S, A, TA,) meaning, of the
handle thereof; (A, TA;) as also خُرَةٌ; (Fr, TA
in art. خرو;) [see again خُرْتَةٌ;] and ↓ خَرْتٌ signifies the same: (A, K:) pl. [of pauc.] أَخْرَاتٌ
(S, A) and [of mult.] خُرُوتٌ. (S.) You say
أَضْيَقُ مِنْ خُرْتِ الإِبْرَةِ [Narrower than the eye
of the needle]. (A.) And مَضَايِقُ كَأَخْرَاتِ الإِبَرِ
[Narrow passes like the eyes of needles]. (A.)
The خُرْت of a sandal is The hole, or perforation,
of the ذُؤَابَة [q. v.], into which the thong [called
the شِرَاك] enters. (An anon. Arabic MS. in my
possession.) ―
-b2-  Also The rings at the heads [or
extremities] of [camels' plaited fore-girths of the
kind called] نُسُوع; and so [the pls.] خُرَتٌ (K)
and أَخْرَاتٌ: (S, K:) and ↓ خُرْتَةٌ signifies one of
these; (K;) i. e. the ring in which is [inserted
the end of] the نِسْعَة. (TA.) [Hence the phrase,]
قَلِقَ خُرْتُ فُلَانٍ [lit. The rings of the fore-girths
of the camels of such a one became unsteady;
meaning] (tropical:)  the state of such a one became
disordered, or perverted. (A, TA.) And similar
to this are the phrases, رَادَ خُرْتُ القَوْمِ and رَادَتْ
أَخْرَاتُهُمْ, [in the TA زاد and زادت, but the comparison evidently shows that the verbs should be
راد and رادت,] said of a people when they do not
receive or entertain hospitably him who alights
at their place of abode: so says IAar on the
authority of Es-Saloolee. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See also خُرْتَةٌ.
―
-b4-  Also A small rib, at, or near, the breast; and
so ↓ خَرْتٌ: (K:) pl. أَخْرَاتٌ, which Lth explains
as meaning the ribs at, or near, the breast, collectively. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And [the pl.] أَخْرَاتٌ signifies The obscure roads or ways, and the narrow
passes, of a desert. (TA.)
خُرْتَةٌ: see خُرْتٌ. ―
-b2-  Its pl. أَخْرَاتٌ, [also pl. of
↓ خُرْتٌ, (see خُبْنٌ,)] in the formation of which
the ة of the sing. seems to have been considered
as elided, also signifies The loops of a [leathern
water-bag such as is called] مَزَادَة: it is said in
the T that in the مزادة are its اخرات, the loops
between which is the قَصَبَة [commonly signifying
cane, or reed, but here app. meaning the mouth,
which has the form of a short cylinder, and is in
the middle of the upper part of the مزادة, between
the two loops, these being at the two upper
corners], whereby [app. referring to the اخرات]
it is carried [and suspended on the side of a
camel, counterpoised by another مزادة on the
other side of the camel]: and AM adds that one
says [also] أَخْرَابُ المَزَادَةِ, sing. خُرْبَةٌ [q. v.];
and in like manner, خُرْبَةُ الأُذُنِ [“ the bore of the
ear ” ]; with ب: and غُلَامٌ أَخْرَبُ الأُذُنَيْنِ [“ a
boy having his ears pierced, or bored ”]: he says,
also, that the خُرْتَة, with ت, is [the hole] in the
iron of the فَأْس, and [the eye] of the needle; and
the خُرْبَة, with ب, is in the skin: and AA says
that خُرْتَةٌ signifies the eye of the [kind of needle
called] شَغِيزَة, i. e. the مِسَلَّة: (TA:) and Lth says
that it signifies a round hole. (TA in art. حرت.)
الخَرَاتَانِ Two stars, (K,) of the stars of the
Lion, two whips' lengths apart, [(see سَوْطٌ,) in]
the two shoulder-blades of the Lion, (TA,) also
called زُبْرَةُ الأَسَدِ, (K,) [composing the Eleventh
Mansion of the Moon: (see زُبْرَةٌ: and see also
مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل:)] the word is mentioned
here in the K, as though it were of the measure
فَعَالَانِ; but accord. to Kr and others, it is dual
of خَرَاةٌ, belonging to art. خرو, in which it is
again mentioned in the K: (TA:) accord. to
ISd, however, only the dual form is known, and
the radical ت and the augmentative ت [by which
latter is meant ة] are in the dual alike: (TA in
art. خرو:) Zj asked Th respecting the خراتان,
and he answered, IAar says that they are two
stars, of those of the Lion; and Aboo-Nasr, the
companion of As, says that they are two stars in
the زبرة of the Lion, i. e. in the middle thereof;
but in my opinion they are two stars after [i. e.
to the eastward of] the جَبْهَة and the قَلْب: Zj
disapproved of this, and replied, I say that they
are two stars in that part of the breast which is
the stabbing-place, derived from خُرْتُ الإِبْرَةِ, “the
eye of the needle: ” but Th rejoined, that this
was an error, because the word is the dual of
خَرَاةٌ; and he cited some verses in which a poet
speaks of certain stars in the Lion, and, among
them, of الخَرَاةُ. (MF, TA.)
خِرِّيتُ (S, A, K) and خِرِّيتٌ مِرِّيتٌ (Sh) A
skilful, or an expert, guide of the way; (Sh, S,
K;) one who pursues the right course to the
أَخْرَات, i. e. the obscure roads or ways, and the
narrow passes, of the deserts; or who pursues the
right course in a way that may be likened to the
خُرْت [or eye] of the needle: (TA:) or skilful;
applied to a man, and [particularly] to a guide:
(A:) pl. خَرَارِتُ, occurring in a verse [perhaps
used by poetic licence for the regular pl. خَرَارِيتُ].
(S.)
مَخْرَتٌ A strait, direct, or right, road or
way. (K.)
مَخْرُوتٌ originally Perforated, bored, or pierced.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Then, (TA,) Having the nose slit;
(K;) [and] so مَخْرُوتُ الأَنْفِ, applied to a camel:
(A, TA:) or مخروت signifies having a slit lip.
(S, K.)
