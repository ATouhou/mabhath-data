not, as some say, خُزْرٌ: [though this is an epithet
applicable to swine:] (TA:) accord. to some,
it is of the measure فِعْلِيلٌ; because ن is not
[generally] added as a second letter: but accord.
to others, of the measure فِنْعِيلٌ; because ن is
sometimes added as a second letter, and because
it is held to be derived from خَزِرَ, since all خنازير
are خُزْر; as it is said in the A, كُلُّ خِنْزِيرٍ أَخْزَرُ.
