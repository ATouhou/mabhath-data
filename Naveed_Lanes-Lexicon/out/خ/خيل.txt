خيل1
خَالَ is syn. with ظَنَّ and تَوَهَّمَ: (TA:) you
say, خَالَ الشَّىْءَ, (Msb, K,) first pers. خِلْتُ, (JK,
S,) aor. يَخَالُ, (Msb, K,) first pers. إِخَالُ and
أَخَالُ, (JK, S, Msb, K, &c.,) the former irregular,
(Msb,) but the more chaste of the two, (S,) and
the more used, (Msb,) of the dial. of Teiyi, but
commonly used by others also, (El-Marzookee,
TA,) the latter of the dial. of Benoo-Asad, accord.
to rule, (S, Msb,) but of weak authority, (K,)
though some assert it to be the more chaste,
(TA,) inf. n. خَيْلٌ (S, Msb, K) and خَيْلَةٌ and
خِيلٌ (K) and خِيلَةٌ (S, K) and خَالٌ and خَيَلَانٌ,
(K, TA, [the last accord. to the CK خَيَلَالٌ,]) or,
as in the T [and JK], خِيلَانٌ, (TA,) and خَيْلُولَةٌ
and مَخِيلَةٌ (S, K) and مَخَالَةٌ; (K;) and خَالَ
الشَّىْءَ, aor. يَخِيلُ, is a dial. var. thereof; (Msb;)
meaning ظَنَّةُ [He thought, or opined, the thing:
and sometimes (see I' Ak p. 109) he knew the
thing: but it seems to have originally signified
توهّم الشىءَ, i. e. he surmised, or fancied, the
thing: see خَالٌ, below]. (S, Msb, K.) This
verb, being of the class of ظَنَّ, occurs with an inchoative and an enunciative; if commencing the
phrase, governing them; but if in the middle or
at the end, it may be made to govern or to have
no government. (S.) You say, إِخَالُ زَيْدًا أَخَاكَ
[and, if you will, زَيْدٌ إِخَالُ أَخُوكَ and زَيْدٌ أَخُوكَ
إِخَالُ, I think Zeyd is thy brother and Zeyd I
think is thy brother and Zeyd is thy brother I
think]. (JK.) Hence the prov., مَنْ يَسْمَعْ يَخَلْ,
(S, TA,) i. e. He who hears the things related of
men and of their vices, or faults, will think evil
of them: meaning that it is most safe to keep
aloof from other men: or, accord. to some, it is
said on the occasion of verifying an opinion.
(TA.)
-A2-  See also 8.
-A3-  خال عَلَىالمَالِ, aor.
يَخِيلُ: see خَالَ in art. خول.
-A4-  خال said of a
horse, (JK, K, TA,) aor. يَخَالُ, (K,) inf. n. خَالٌ,
(JK, K,) He limped, or halted, or was slightly
lame. (JK, K. *)
2
تَخْيِيلٌ signifies The imaging a thing in the
mind, or fancying it; the forming an image, or
a fancied image, thereof in the mind: (TA:)
[and ↓ تَخَيُّلٌ has the same, as well as a quasipass., signification.] You say, [↓ خَيَّلْتُهُ فَتَخَيَّلَ
لِى and] لِى ↓ فَتَخَيَّلَ ↓ تَخَيَّلْتُهُ [I imaged it in the
mind, or fancied it, and it became imaged in the
mind to me, or an object of fancy to me]; like as
you say, [صَوَّرْتُهُ فَتَصَوَّرَ لِى and] تَصَوَّرْتُهُ فَتَصَوَّرَ لِى:
(S:) for ↓ تَخَيُّلٌ [as inf. n. of a quasi-pass. verb]
signifies a thing's being imaged in the mind, or
fancied: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and الشَّىْءُ لَهُ ↓ تخيّل
means تَشَبَّهَ. (K. [And the same is indicated in
the Msb.]) You say also, خُيِّلَ لَهُ كَذَا [Such a
thing was imaged to him in the mind; i. e. such
a thing seemed to him]; from الوَهْمُ and الظَّنُّ:
(Msb:) and خُيِّلَ إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ كَذَا (S) It was imaged
to him [in the mind, i. e. it seemed to him,] that
it was so; syn. شُبِّهَ; (PS;) from التَّخْيِيلُ and
الوَهْمُ: (S, TA:) and لَهُ أَنَّهُ كَذَا ↓ تَخَيَّلَ signifies
[in like manner it became imaged &c.; i. e.]
تَشَبَّهَ; as also ↓ تخايل: (S:) and so the first of
these three verbs is used in the Kur xx. 69.
(TA.) And فُلَانٌ يَمْضِى عَلَى مَا خَيَّلَتْ, (JK
and S in explanation of the phrase فُلَانٌ يَمْضِى
↓ عَلَىالمُخَيَّلِ,) i. e. شَبَّهَتْ [Such a one goes on,
notwithstanding what (the mind, or the case,)
may image to him, or what is fancied by him, of
danger of difficulty; النَّفْسُ, or الحَالُ, accord. to
Z, (see Freytag's Arab. Prov. ii. 94,) being understood]; meaning, notwithstanding peril, or
risk; without any certain knowledge. (S.)
Whence the prov.,
عَلَىمَا خُيِّلَتْ وَعْثُ القَصِيمِ
i. e. I will go on, notwithstanding what the soft
tracts abounding in sand in which the feet sink
may be imagined to be: [or the right reading is
probably خَيَّلَتْ, i. e. notwithstanding what the
soft tracts &c. may image to the mind, of danger
or difficulty:] the ت in خيّلت relates to the word
وعث, which is [regarded as] pl. of وَعْثَةٌ; and
على is a connective of a suppressed verb, namely,
أَمْضِى, with what follows it: the meaning is, I
will assuredly venture upon the affair, notwithstanding its terribleness. (Meyd.) And اِفْعَلْ
ذٰلِكَ عَلَى مَا خَيَّلَتْ, i. e. عَلَى مَا شَبَّهَتْ [Do thou
that, notwithstanding what (the mind, or the case,
as explained above,) may image to thee, of danger
or difficulty]; (JK;) meaning, in any case.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] خيّل لِلنَّاقَةِ, and ↓ أَخْيَلَ, He
put a خَيَال [q. v.] near the she-camel's young one,
in order that the wolf might be scared away from
him, (JK, * S, K, *) and not approach him. (JK,
S.) ―
-b3-  And خيّل فِيهِ الخَيْرَ He perceived, or discovered, in him an indication, or external sign, of
good; as also ↓ تخيّلهُ (K, TA) and تخوّلهُ:
(TA: [see also 4 in art. خول:]) or you say,
عَلَيْهِ ↓ تَخَيَّلَتْ, (T, S, TA,) meaning I knew him;
or knew his internal, or real, state; (تَخَبَّرْتُهُ, T,
TA;) or I chose him; (اِخْتَرْتُهُ, S, TA;) and
perceived, or discovered, in him an indication, or
external sign, of good. (T, S, TA.) ―
-b4-  And خيّل
عَلَيْهِ, (S, Msb, K,) inf.n. تَخْيِيلٌ (Msb, K) and
↓ تَخَيُّلٌ, (K,) [the latter anomalous, being properly inf. n. of تَخَيَّلَ,] He conveyed doubt, or
suspicion, (التُّهْمَةَ, S, K, or الوَهْمَ, Msb,) to him;
so in the M, on the authority of AZ; (TA;)
i. q. لَبَّسَ عَلَيْهِ [he made (a thing, or case) dubious
to him]. (Msb.) ―
-b5-  And خيّلت عَلَيْنَا السَّمَآءُ The
sky thundered and lightened [over us], and prepared to rain: but when the rain has fallen, the
term ↓ تَخَيُّلٌ [so in my two copies of the S, app.
used as an inf. n. of the verb in this phrase, as in
a case above, or perhaps a mistranscription for
تَخْيِيلٌ, though it will be seen from what follows
that خيّلت and تخيّلت are both said of the sky in
the same sense,] is not used: (S:) or خيّلت
السَّمَآءُ signifies the sky became clouded, but did
not rain; (JK, and Har p. 36;) as also ↓ اخالت
and ↓ تخيّلت and ↓ خايلت: (Har ibid.:) or, as
also ↓ تخيّلت (Msb, K) and ↓ اخالت, (Msb,) or
↓ أَخْيَلَت, (K,) the sky prepared to rain, (Msb,
K, TA,) and thundered and lightened, but did not
yet rain: (TA:) or, accord. to Az, ↓ اخالت
السَّمَآءُ signifies the sky became clouded: (Msb,
TA:) and السَّمَآءُ ↓ تخيّلت the sky became clouded,
and prepared to rain. (S.) [In like manner,]
one says also, السَّحَابُ ↓ اخالت and ↓ أَخْيَلَت and
↓ خايلت The clouds gave hope of rain: (S:) or
السَّحَابَةُ ↓ اخالت the cloud showed signs of rain,
so that it was thought [or expected] to rain.
(Msb.)
-A2-  خيّل also signifies, (JK, TA,) or
↓ تخيّل, (Ham p. 39,) [or each of these,] He
(a man) was cowardly, or weak-hearted, on the
occasion of fight, (JK, TA, and Ham,) and did
not act, or proceed, firmly, or steadily. (Ham.)
And خيّل عَنِ القَوْمِ and ↓ أَخْيَلَ, [but the former
only is explained in this sense in the TA,] He
held back from the people, or party, through
cowardice: (K, TA:) so says Az, on the authority of' Arrám. (TA.)
3
خايلهُ, (JK, TA,) inf. n. مُخَايَلَةٌ, (S, K,)
He vied with him, rivalled him, or imitated him,
(JK, S, * K, * TA,) in pride and self-conceit; (JK;)
did as he did. (TA.) ―
-b2-  خايلت السَّمَآءُ, and
السَّحَابُ: see 2, in the latter part of the paragraph.
4
اخال It (a thing) was, or became, dubious,
or confused, or vague, (JK, S, Mgh, Msb, TA,)
عَلَيْهِ to him. (JK, Mgh.) One says, هٰذَا أَمْرٌ لَا
يُخِيلُ [This is a thing, or an affair, or a case,
that will not be dubious, &c.]. (S.) And لَا يُخِيلُ
ذَاكَ عَلَى أَحَدٍ That will not be dubious, &c., to
any one. (JK.) ―
-b2-  اخال الشَّىْءُ إِلَى الخَيْرِ, and
المَكْرُوهِ, The thing exhibited an indication, or indications, of good, and of evil, or what was disliked or hated. (Msb.) [Hence,] اخالت السَّمَآءُ,
and أَخْيَلَت: see 2, in the latter part of the paragraph, in four places. And اخالت السَّحَابُ and
أَخْيَلَت, or اخالت السَّحَابَةُ: see, again, 2, in the
latter part of the paragraph, in three places. ―
-b3-
And hence, in the opinion of ISd, the she-camel
in this case being likened to clouds [giving hope,
or showing signs, of rain], (TA,) اخالت النَّاقَةُ
(tropical:) The she-camel had milk in her udder, (JK, K,
TA,) and was in good condition of body. (JK,
TA.) ―
-b4-  اخالت الأَرْضُ بِالنَّبَاتِ, (K,) or, as in the

so ↓ تخايلت; whence,] a poet says,
تَأَزَّرَ فِيهِ النَّيْتُ حَتَّى تَخَايَلَتْ
رُبَاهُ وَحَتَّى مَا تُرَى الشَّآءُ نُوَّمَا
[The herbage in it became, or had become, tangled,

verb in this ex. is indicated by the context. See
also 4, where a similar meaning is assigned to
اخالت or اختالت.]) ―
-b6-  تَخَيُّلٌ also signifies The
being, or becoming, of various colours. (JK,

which is followed in this instance, as usual, by
the author of the TK, as meaning فِرَاسَةٌ: but this
is a mistake: for وهى الفراسة, the explanation in
