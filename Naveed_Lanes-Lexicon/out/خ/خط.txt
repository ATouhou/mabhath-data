خط1
خَطَّ, aor.
خَطُ3َ, inf. n. خَطٌّ, He made [a line,
or lines, or] a mark, عَلَى الأَرْضِ, upon the ground.
(Msb.) You say, خَطَّ الزَّاجِرُ فِى الأَرْضِ, aor. and
inf. n. as above, The diviner made a line, or a
mark, or lines, or marks, upon the ground, and
then divined. (TA.) And الزَّاجِرُ يَخُطُّ بِإِصْبَعِهِ فِى
الرَّمْلِ وَيَزْجُرُ [The diviner makes lines, or marks,
with his finger upon the sand, and divines]. (S.)
Th says, on the authority of IAar, that عِلْمُ الخَطِّ
is عِلْمُ الرَّمْلِ [or geomancy]: I 'Ab says that it is
an ancient science, which men have relinquished:
but Lth says that it is practised to the present
time; [to which I may add, that it has not even
now ceased; being still practised on sand and the
like, and also on paper;] and they have conventional terms which they employ in it, and they
elicit thereby the secret thoughts &c., and often
hit upon the right therein: the diviner comes to
a piece of soft ground, and he has a boy, with
whom is a style; and the master makes many
lines, or marks, in haste, that they may not be
counted; then he returns, and obliterates leisurely
lines, or marks, two by two; and if there remain
two lines, or marks, they are a sign of success,
and of the attainment of the thing wanted: while
he obliterates, his boy says, for the sake of auguring well, اِبْنَىْ عِيَانْ أَسْرِعَا البَيَانْ [O two sons of
'Iyán (meaning two lines or marks), hasten ye
the manifestation]: I 'Ab says that when he has
obliterated the lines, or marks, and one remains,
it is the sign of disappointment: and AZ and
Lth relate the like of this. (TA.) It is said in a
trad. of Mo'áwiyeh Ibn-El-Hakam Es-Sulamee,
traced up by him to its author, كَانَ نَبِىٌّ مِنَ
الأَنْبِيَآءِ يَخُطُّ فَمَنْ خَطَّهُ عَلِمَ مِثْلَ عِلْمِهِ [A
prophet of the prophets used to practise geomancy; and he who matches his geomancy knows
the like of his knowledge]. (TA.) You say also,
when a man is meditating upon his affair, and
considering what may be its issue, or result, فُلَانٌ
يَخُطُّ فِى الأَرْضِ (tropical:)  [Such a one makes lines, or
marks, upon the ground]. (TA.) [See also
نَكَتَ: and see St. John's Gospel, ch. viii. verses
6 and 8.] And خَطَّ بِرِجْلِهِ الأَرْضَ means (tropical:)  He
walked, or went along. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, (S, Msb,)
aor. as above, (Msb,) and so the inf. n., (Msb,
K,) He wrote (S, Msb, K) a writing, or book,
(Msb,) or a thing, (TA,) with the reed prepared
for that purpose, (S, K,) or with some other
thing; (K, TA;) [and so ↓ خطّط, for] تَخْطِيطٌ is
syn. with تَسْطِيرٌ, or, as in the T, like تسطير;
whence the saying, خُطِّطَتْ عَلَيْهِ ذُنُوبُهُ His sins
were written [or registered] against him. (TA.)

-b7-  خَطَطْتُ بِالسَّيْفِ وَجْهَهُ
وَوَسَطَهُ (tropical:)  [I cut, or clave, with the sword his face
and his waist]. (TA.) And خَطَّهُ بِالسَّيْفِ نِصْفَيْنِ
(tropical:)  [He clave him, or it, in halves with the sword].
(TA.) And جَارَاهُ فَمَا خَطَّ غُبَارَهُ (tropical:)  He contended

-b8-  خَطَّ اللّٰهُ نَوْءَهَا [God made its
(a land's) rain-giving star or asterism (see نَوْءٌ)
to pass it over: or may God make &c.]: from
خَطِيطَةٌ signifying “ a land not rained upon between two lands that have been rained upon: ”
(S, TA: *) it was said by I' Ab [in a tropical
sense, by way of imprecation, with reference to a
woman], when he was asked respecting a man
who had put the affair of his wife in her own
hand and she had in consequence divorced him
by a triple sentence: (S:) accord. to one relation,
it is خَطَّأَ; the meaning being “ may he make its
rain to miss it: ” (S, TA:) and accord. to another,
↓ خَطَّى, originally خَطَّطَ, like تَقَضَّى البَازِى: the
former, or first, is the weaker, or weakest, in
authority, of these relations. (TA. [See also 2 in
art. خطأ.])

copies of the K;) or ↓ اخطّها; (as in other copies
of the K, and as in the TA;) and لِنَفْسِهِ ↓ خَطَّهَا:
(TA:) and he alighted and took up his abode in

thing: (K:) pl. خُطُوطٌ (S, K) and أَخْطَاطٌ; (K;)
the latter, [a pl. of pauc.,] used by El-'Ajjáj:
(TA:) and ↓ خُطَّةٌ is [syn. with خَطٌّ as explained
above, being] a subst. form [the inf. n.] الخَطُّ,
like as نُقْطَةٌ is from النَّقْطُ: (S, K: *) you say,

ass are two lines, or streaks, differing in colour
from the rest of the body. (TA.) ―

but decide it so as to settle it and extricate himself
from it. (S, TA.) [See also حَاجِزٌ.] Also, in a
trad. respecting El-Hodeybiyeh, لَايَسْألُونِى خُطَّةً
يُعَظِّمُونَ فِيهَا حُرُمَاتِ اللّٰهِ تَعَالَى إِلَّا أَعْطِيْتُهُمْ إِيَّاهَا

same, قَدْ عَرَضَ عَلَيْكُمْ خُطَّةَ رُشْدٍ فَاقْبَلُوهَا He hath
proposed to you a case of evident rectitude; therefore do ye accept it. (TA.) And Taäbbatasharrà says,

sentence in this paragraph:] the vulgar say
خُطْبَةٌ: (S, L:) the former is the word used by

piece of ground, and a house, which a man takes
to himself, and upon which he makes a mark, in
land not possessed, that he may have it for himself exclusively, and build there; this being
done when the Sultán gives permission to a
number of the Muslims to found houses in a particular place, and to make their abodes there, as
they did in El-Koofeh and El-Basrah: (L:) or
a place which is taken and marked for building
houses, or for habitation, or the like: (Mgh,
Msb:) or, as is said in the Bári', a piece of
ground, or land, which a man takes to himself,
and upon which he makes a mark, it not having
belonged to any one before him; as also ↓ خِطٌّ;
(Msb;) which latter is explained by IDrd as
signifying a place which one takes to himself,
and marks, from other places: (IB, L:) or both
signify a piece of land in which one alights and
takes up his abode, none having done so before
him: (K:) the pl. of the former is حِطَزٌ. (S,
Msb.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] فُلَانٌ بَيِّنٌ خِطَطِ المَكَارِمِ

رِمَاحٌ خَطِّيَّةٌ Spears of El-Khatt; so called
from الخَطُّ, a place in El-Yemámeh, (S, Msb,)
also called خَطُّ هَجَرٍ, (S,) because they are brought
thither (S, Msb) from India, (S,) and straightened
in that place, (S, Msb, *) which is a coast for
ships; not that the canes grow there: (Msb:) or
they are so called from الخَطُّ which is the station
for ships in El-Bahreyn, because they are sold
there; not that it is the place of their growth:
this place is also called الخِطُّ: (K:) but this
demands consideration; for it is said [in the 'Eyn,
i. e.] by Lth, (TA,) or by Kh, (Msb,) that when
you convert the rel. n. into a subst., you say
↓ خِطِيَّةٌ, (Msb, TA,) with kesr to the خ, (Msb,)
without رماح, like as you say, ثِيَابٌ قِبْطِيَّةٌ, (Msb,
TA,) with kesr, (Msb,) but when you convert
the rel. n. into a subst., you say, قُبْطِيَّةٌ, (Msb,
TA,) with damm, to distinguish the subst. from
the rel. n., without ثياب: (Msb:) a single spear
of this kind is called رُمْحٌ خَطِّىٌّ: (TA:) AHn
says that الخَطِّىُّ signifies the spears; and that it
is a rel. n. used in the manner of a proper name;
being a rel. n. from الخَطُّ, which is خَطُّ البَحْرَيْنِ,
where ships moor when they come from India.
