خسو2
خسّى, (so in some copies of the K, and in
the TA,) in [some of] the copies of the K تخسّى,
but the former is the right, (TA,) inf. n. تَخْسِيَةٌ,
He played with walnuts at the game of odd or
even; (K, TA;) as also ↓ اخسى: and ↓ خاساهُ,
(inf. n. مُخَاسَاةٌ, TA,) He played with him at that
game: (K:) or you say, هُوَ يُخَسِّى وَ يُزَكِّى He
plays, and says, “Is it even or odd?” (TA.)
3
خَاْسَوَand 4: see above.
6
تَخَاسَا They (two men) played together at
the game of odd or even. (JK, * TA.)
خَسَا, (JK, K, * and TA in art. زكو,) without
tenween, and accord. to some with tenween, and
not having the article ال prefixed to it; and in
like manner زَكَا, which is coupled with the
former, is without tenween, and accord. to some
with tenween, and not having the article ال
prefixed to it; (TA in that art.;) [but each has
ال prefixed to it in the K;] accord. to Fr, some
make it quasi-coordinate to فَتًى [i. e. with tenween, and masc.]; some, to زفر [app. meaning
the proper name زُفَرُ i. e. without tenween, and
masc.]; and some, to سَكْرَى [app. meaning without tenween, and fem.]: (TA:) a word that is
said in playing with walnuts; (JK;) An odd
number: (Lth, Fr, K, TA:) and زكا signifies an
even number: (Lth, Fr, TA:) accord. to IB, its
final letter is hemzeh, for one says, يُخَاسِئُ
meaning يُقَامِرُ [he contends in a game of hazard];
but it is pronounced without ء to assimilate it to
زكا: (TA:) the pl. is أَخَاسٍ, (K, TA,) accord.
to the M, مَخَاسٍ, like مَسَاوٍ, (TA, [but the former
pl. occurs in a verse cited in the TA,]) which is
anomalous. (K.) One says, خَسًا أَوْ زَكًا, [so in
my copies of the S, with tenween,] i. e. Odd or
even? (S:) [or خَسَا أَوْ زَكَا, as shown above:]
and some say, خَسَا زَكَا, like خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ. (IB,
TA.) And it is said in a trad., مَا أَدْرِى كَمْ حَدَّثَنِى
أَبِى عِنْ رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلَّمَ أَخْسَا أَمْ
زَكَا, or أَخْسًا أَمْ زَكًا, [for the vowel-signs are not
written in my original,] meaning فَرْدًا أَمْ زَوْجًا
[i. e. I know not how many times my father told
me, from the Apostle of God, God bless and save
him; whether an odd or an even number: or,
perhaps, once or twice]. (TA.)
