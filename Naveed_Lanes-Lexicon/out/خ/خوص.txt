to AM, all that they have related respecting this
word is correct except narrowness of the eyes;
for the Arabs, when they mean this, use the term
حَوَصٌ, with [the unpointed] ح; but when they
mean the eye's being sunk, or depressed, this
they term خَوَصٌ, with [the pointed] خ: (TA:)
and accord. to A 'Obeyd's relation on the authority of his companions, (TA,) [and accord. to
Mtr also,] خَوِصَتْ عَيْنُهُ signifies his eye became
sunk, or depressed; (Mgh, TA;) but حَوِصَتْ,
