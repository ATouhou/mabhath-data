ختم1
خَتَمَهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
خَتِمَ, (Msb, K,)
inf. n. خَتْمٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and خِتَامٌ, (Lh,
K, TA,) with kesr, (TA,) [in the CK, erroneously, خَتَام,] i. q. طَبَعَهُ [He sealed, stamped,
imprinted, or impressed, it]: (Msb, K:) or he
put the خَاتَم [or signet] upon it: (Mgh:) namely,
a thing, (S, Mgh,) or a writing or book and the
like: and خَتَمَ عَلَيْهِ signifies the same [or he put
a seal, or the impression of a signet, upon it].
(Msb.) Accord. to Er-Rághib, خَتْمٌ and طَبْعٌ
signify The impressing a thing with the engraving
of the signet and stamp: and the former [as is
indicated, but not plainly expressed, as distinguished from the latter,] is tropically used,
sometimes, as meaning the securing oneself from
a thing, and protecting [oneself] from it; in consideration of protection by means of sealing upon
writings and doors: and sometimes as meaning
the producing an impression, or effect, upon a
thing from another thing; in consideration of the
impress produced [by the signet]: and sometimes
it is used as relating to (assumed tropical:)  the reaching the end [of
a thing]: (TA:) or the primary signification of
خَتْمٌ is the act of covering over [a thing]: (Az,
TA:) accord. to Zj, the proper meaning of خَتْمٌ
and طَبْعٌ is the covering over a thing, and securing
oneself from a thing's entering it: some say that
the former signifies the concealing a notification
of a thing, [as] by putting one's fingers over it, by
way of guarding oneself thereby. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Hence, خَتْمُ الشَّهَادَةِ [The sealing of the testimony];
which is thus described by El-Hulwánee: the
witness, when he wrote his name upon a صَكّ
[q. v.], caused his written name to be beneath a
piece of lead, [i. e. covered it with a piece of lead,]
and put upon it the impress of his signet, in order
that there might be no falsification of it or substitution for it. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  As to خَتْمُ الأَعْنَاقِ [The
sealing of the necks], the case is related, in the
“Risáleh Yoosufeeyeh,” to have been this:
'Omar sent Ibn-Honeyf to seal the عُلُوج [or unbelievers] of the Sawád; and he sealed five
hundred thousand of them, in classes; that is, he
marked them twelve dirhems, and twenty-four,
and forty-eight; tying a thong upon the neck of
each, and putting upon the knot a seal of lead.
(Mgh.) ―
-b4-  خَتْمٌ also signifies The protecting what
is in a writing by marking [or stamping] a piece
of clay [upon it, or by means of a seal of any
kind]. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And you say, of a man, خَتَمَ
عَلَيْكَ بَابَهُ [He sealed his door against thee];
meaning (tropical:)  he turned away from thee, avoided thee,
or shunned thee. (TA.) ―
-b6-  And خَتَمَ لَكَ بَابَهُ
[He sealed for thee his door]; meaning (tropical:)  he preferred thee to others. (TA.) ―
-b7-  خَتَمَ عَلَى قَلْبِهِ
[which may be rendered He sealed his heart]
means (tropical:)  he made him to be such that he understood
not, and such that nothing proceeded from him;
or he made his heart, or mind, to be such that it
understood not, &c. (K, TA.) خَتَمَ اللّٰهُ عَلَى
قُلُوبِهِمْ, in the Kur [ii. 6], is like the phrase in
the same [xvi. 110 and xlvii. 18] طَبَعَ اللّٰهُ عَلَى
قُلُوبِهِمْ: (TA:) it points to what God has made
to be usually the case when a man has ended in
believing what is false and in committing that
which is forbidden, so that he turns not his face to
the truth; this occasioning, as its result, his becoming inured to the approval of acts of disobedience, so that he is as though this habit were
impressed upon his heart: the assertion of ElJubbáee, that it means God hath put a seal upon
their hearts, as a sign, to the angels, of their
infidelity, is nought: (Er-Rághib, TA:) الخَتْمُ
is explained by IAar as meaning the preventing
of the heart from believing. (L in art. خدع.)
[See also طَبَعَ.] ―
-b8-  خَتَمَ الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. خَتْمٌ, also
signifies [as indicated above] (assumed tropical:)  He reached the
end of the thing. (K.) And الشَّىْءَ ↓ اِخْتَتَمْتُ
(assumed tropical:)  [I ended, or finished, the thing,] contr. of
اِفْتَتَحْتُهُ. (S, TA.) You say, خَتَمَ القُرْآنَ (assumed tropical:)  He
reached the end of the Kur-án [in reciting it];
(S, Er-Rághib;) [he recited the whole of the
Kur-án;] he completed [the recital of] the Kur-
án: (Mgh:) [and] he retained in his memory the
last portion of the Kur-án; meaning he retained
the whole of it in his memory. (Msb.) It is said
of Suleymán El-Aamash, كَانَ يَقْرَأُ خَتْمًا, meaning
(assumed tropical:)  He used to recite the whole of the Kur-án; at
one time, according to the reading of Ibn-Mes'ood;
at another time, from the edition of 'Othmán.
(Mgh.) ―
-b9-  You say also, خَتَمَ اللّٰهُ لَهُ بِخَيْرٍ (assumed tropical:)  [May
God make his end to be good]. (S.) ―
-b10-  خَتَمَ البَذْرَ
(assumed tropical:)  He covered over the sown seed: (Az, TA:) or

خَتِمَ, inf. n.
خَتْمٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  he watered the seed-produce, or
sown field, the first time; (JK, K, TA;) because,
when it is watered, it is finished (خُتِمَ) with the
رحا [app. رَحَا, which here seems to mean the
“roller,” as being likened to a mill-stone, though
I find no authority for this meaning]; (TA;) as
also خَتَمَ عَلَيْهِ: (K:) or خَتَمُوا عَلَى زُرُوعِهِمْ

were as yet كِرَاب [app. meaning clear of vegetation]. (JK, TA.) ―

filled with honey the place in which they deposited
it: (JK, A, TA:) or خَتْمٌ signifies bees' collecting
some thin wax, thinner than the wax of the comb,

ex. in a verse of Lebeed cited in art. دكن.]
―
-b3-  (tropical:)  [The hymen; as being the seal of virginity;
as also ↓ خَاتَمٌ.] You say, زُفَّتْ إِلَيْكَ بِخِتَامِهَا
(tropical:)  [She was conducted as a bride to thee with her
seal of virginity], and رَبِّهَا ↓ بِخَاتَمِ [with the seal

will be the odour of musk: (S, TA:) or, accord.
to 'Alkameh and Mujáhid, its admixture shall
be musk: accord. to Ibn-Mes'ood, its result shall
be the taste of musk: Fr says, ↓ خَاتَمٌ and ↓ خَاتِمٌ
and خِتَامٌ are nearly the same in meaning;
whence the reading of 'Alee, مِسْكٌ ↓ خَاتَمُهُ: and
the explanation is this; that when any one shall
drink thereof, he will find the last cup thereof
to have the odour of musk: Er-Rághib says
that the meaning is, the end, and the last draught,
i. e. what shall remain, thereof shall be in perfume [like] musk: and that the assertion that
it means it shall be sealed with musk is nought.
(TA.) [See also خَاتَمٌ and خَاتِمَةٌ.]

the same; (JK, S, Msb, K, TA;) [A signet;
generally a signet-ring; i. e.] a certain ornament
(حَلْىٌ, M, K) for the finger, (K,) app., at the
first, used for sealing, or stamping, therewith;
so that the word is of the same class as طَابَعٌ: afterwards, in consequence of frequency of usage,
applied to one not used for that purpose: (ISd,
TA:) or a ring having a فَصّ of a substance
different therefrom [set in it; i. e., having a

of خَاتَامٌ] خَوَاتِيمُ: (S, in which the former pl.,
though more common, is not mentioned, and K:)
Sb says that those who use the latter pl. make
it to be pl. of a sing. of the measure فَاعَالٌ,
though it be not in their language; which shows
that he knew not خَاتَامٌ: the pl. of خَتْمٌ is خُتُومٌ.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  خَاتَمٌ also signifies A seal, or stamp,
and a mark: so in a trad., in which it is said,
آمِينَ خَاتَمُ رَبِّ العَالَمِينَ عَلَى عِبَادِهِ المُؤْمِنِينَ, i. e.
[آمِينَ (or Amen) is] the seal, or stamp, and the
mark, [of the Lord of the beings of the whole world
upon his servants the believers,] which removes
from them accidents, and causes of mischief; for
the seal of the writing protects it, and precludes
those who look from [seeing] what is within
it. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See also خِتَامٌ, in seven places. [It
is nearly syn. with خِتَامٌ, as Fr says: and thus,]

the contr. of مُفْتَتَحٌ; as in the saying, التَّحْمِيدُ
مُفْتَتَحُ الْقُرْآنِ وَ الِاسْتِعَاذَةُ مُخْتَتَمُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [The declaration of the praises of God is the opening portion
of the Kur-án, and the prayer for the protection
of God is its closing portion]; (A, TA;) and it
is a chaste word, of frequent occurrence, though
the contr. has been asserted. (TA.) One says
also, الأَعْمَالُ بِخَوَاتِيمِهَا [Actions are characterized,
or to be judged, as good or evil, by their results].
(TA.) ―
-b4-  Also, i. e. خَاتَمٌ, of a mare, (tropical:)  The lower

here used as a dial. var. of طُبْى, i. e. the teat,
though I do not find it mentioned in its proper
art. in any lexicon; unless مِنْ طُبْيَتِهَا be a mistranscription for من طُبْيِهَا]: (K, TA:) so called
by way of comparison [to a signet or seal]. (TA.)

[measure called] قَفِيز. (Mgh in art. كر. [It is
there added that the قفيز is the tenth part of the
جَرِيب: but it seems that this is the قفيز which is
a measure of land; not what is here meant in the
explanation of مختوم, which is a measure of corn
and the like.]) [Pl. مَخَاتِيمُ.]
مُخْتَتَمٌ: see خَاتَمٌ, in the latter half of the
