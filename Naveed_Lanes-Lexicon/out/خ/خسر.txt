خسر1
خَسِرَ, (S, A, Msb, K, &c.,) aor.
خَسَرَ; (K;)
and خَسَرَ, aor.
خَسِرَ; (K;) but the latter is an unusual form [except in the sense of أَخْسَرَ]; (B,
TA;) inf. n. خُسْرَانٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and خُسْرٌ
(S, Msb, K) and خَسَارَةٌ (Msb, K) [which are the
only forms assigned in the TA to the verb when
used with reference to traffic] and خُسُرٌ and خَسْرٌ
and خَسَرٌ and خَسَارٌ; (K;) He lost, or suffered
loss or diminution: or he was deceived, cheated,
beguiled, or circumvented: (K:) فِى البَيْعِ in
selling; (S;) or فِى بَيَعِهِ in his selling; (A;) or
فِى تِجَارَتِهِ in his traffic: (Msb, K: [see also 4:])
the former is the original signification: (TA:)
he suffered diminution of his capital; he lost part
thereof: (B, TA:) and he lost his capital altogether. (Bd in iv. 118; &c.) خُسْرَانٌ is also
attributed to an action, as well as to a man: (B,
TA:) you say, (but in this case the verb is used
tropically, A,) خَسِرَتْ تِجَارَتُهُ (tropical:)  [His traffic was
losing; or an occasion of loss]; (A, B;) opposed
to رَبِحَتْ. (A.) It is also used in relation to
personal acquisitions; such as health, and safety,
and intellect, and faith, and the recompense or
reward of obedience [to God], which God has
declared [Kur xxii. 11 and xxxix. 17] to be manifest خُسْرَان, (B,) since there is none like it. (Bd.)
For instance, you say, خَسِرَ عَقْلَهُ, and مَالَهُ, He
lost his intellect, and his property. (IAar.) [In
a phrase of this kind, the noun which immediately
follows the verb may be considered as put in the
accus. case on account of the rejection of a prep.,
namely فِى: for] it is said that خَسِرَ is never
used otherwise than intransitively: though this
has been contradicted, on the ground of the following phrase in the Kur [xxii. 11], خَسِرَ الدُّنْيَا
وَ الْآخِرَةَ [He hath lost, or he loseth, the things of
the present life and of the latter life]; and the
like; as الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَ أَهْلِيهِمْ [Who shall
have lost themselves, or their own souls, and their
families, or their wives; Kur xxxix. 17 and
xlii. 44]; (MF, TA;) i. e., themselves, or their
own souls, by their having erred, and their families by their having caused them to err, or by
being separated from them for ever; (Bd;) or
by being themselves made to remain for ever in
Hell, and by their not gaining access to the حُور
prepared in Paradise [as wives] for the believers:
(Jel:) or the meaning is, accord. to Fr, who shall
be deceived of their own souls, &c.: or, accord. to
others, who shall have destroyed their own souls,
&c. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also [He experienced, or saw, that
he was loser; or] his having lost became manifest to him: so in the Kur xl. [78 and] last verse.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  Also (with all the forms of the inf. n.
above mentioned, K,) He erred; went astray;
deviated from, or lost, or missed, the right way:
or he became lost; he perished; or he died: syn.
ضَلَّ, (K,) and هَلَكَ. (Msb.)
-A2-  خَسَرَهُ, (A 'Obeyd,
IAar, Zj, S, A, &c.,) aor.
خَسِرَ (Zj, Msb) and
خَسُرَ, (Bd
in lv. 8,) inf. n. خَسْرٌ (Msb, K) and خُسْرَانٌ; (K;)
and ↓ اخسرهُ, (A 'Obeyd, Zj, S, A, Msb,) inf. n.
إِخْسَارٌ; (Msb, K;) and ↓ خسّرهُ; (A;) He made
it defective, or deficient; (A 'Obeyd, IAar, Zj, S,
A, Msb, K;) namely, the weight, and the measure; (Zj, TA;) and the thing weighed; (TA;)
and the balance, (A 'Obeyd, IAar, Zj, A, Msb,)
by diminishing the weight. (Msb.) ↓ The second
of these forms is more common, in this sense, than
the first (Zj, TA) [and than the third]. For
الْمِيزَانَ ↓ وَ لَا تُخْسِرُوا, in the Kur lv. 8, there are
three other readings; namely تَخْسُرُوا and تَخْسُروا
and تَخْسَرُوا; in the last of which, the prep. فِى
is omitted after the verb. (Bd.) ―
-b2-  [And He, or
it, made him to lose, or suffer loss; to err, or go
astray; to become lost, or to perish.]
2
خسّرهُ, (A, K,) inf. n. تَخْسِيرٌ, (S, K,) i. q.
خَسَرَهُ, q. v.: (A:) [and particularly] He, or it,
destroyed him; caused him to perish. (S, K.)
You say, خسّرهُ سُوْءُ عَمَلِهِ (tropical:)  The evilness of his conduct caused him to perish. (A.) ―
-b2-  He put him
away, or far away; removed, alienated, or
estranged, him; (IAar, Msb;) from good, or
prosperity. (IAar.) ―
-b3-  He attributed, or imputed, to him خُسْرَان [i. e. loss; or error, or
deviation from the right way]: like كَذَّبَهُ meaning “ he attributed, or imputed, to him lying,”
&c. (Msb.)
4
اخسرهُ i. q. خَسَرَهُ, which see in three places:
(A 'Obeyd, Zj, S, A, Msb:) [and particularly]
He made him to lose, or suffer loss, in his traffic;
contr. of أَرْبَحَهُ. (A.)
-A2-  And اخسر He fell into
loss; (A;) he met with loss in his traffic. (TA.
[See also 1.])
خُسْرٌ an inf. n. of خَسِرَ. (S, Msb, K.) In the
Kur ciii. 2, accord. to some, it means Punishment
for sin. (TA.)
خَسِرٌ: see خَاسِرٌ.
خُسْرَانٌ an inf. n. of خَسِرَ. (S, A, Msb, K.)
[For particular usages thereof, see 1. As a simple
subst., it generally signifies Loss, or the state of
suffering loss or diminution: the state of being
deceived or cheated: error, or deviation from the
right way: (see also خَسَارٌ:) or the state of becoming lost, of perishing, or of dying.] ―
-b2-  It is
also an inf. n. of خَسَرَهُ. (K.)
خُسْرَوِىٌّ: see what next follows.
خُسْرَوَانِىٌّ, (A, K,) or خُسْرُوَانِىٌّ, (TA, [but the
former is the better known,]) A certain kind of
garment or cloth; (A, K;) so called in relation
to Khusrow Sháh, one of the [kings of Persia
called] أَكَاسِرَة [pl. of كِسْرَى or كَسْرَى]; as also
↓ خُسْرَوِىٌّ. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  And A certain wine or
beverage. (K.)
خَسَارٌ and ↓ خَسَارَةٌ, [both inf. ns. of خَسِرَ, q. v.,]
(S,) and ↓ خَيْسَرَى, (S, M, K, in some copies of
the K written خَنْسَرَى, with ن, TA,) Error; or
deviation from the right way: [like خُسْرَانٌ:]
(S:) and perdition; or death; (S, K;) as also
↓ خَنَاسِيرُ, (S, and K in art. خنسر,) which last [is
of a pl. form, but] has no sing. (S.) ―
-b2-  And all
the foregoing words, including ↓ خناسير, Baseness,
ignobleness, ungenerousness, or meanness; (K;)
the last, in poetry, shortened to ↓ خَنَاسِرُ: (TA:)
and ↓ خَيْسَرَى, (K,) and, as some say, ↓ خَنَاسِيرُ,
(TA,) perfidy, unfaithfulness, or treachery. (K,
TA.)
خَسِيرٌ: see خَاسِرٌ.
خَسَارَةٌ: see خَسَارٌ.
خَاسِرٌ Losing, or suffering loss, in his traffic.
(Lth.) And [hence,] تِجَارَةٌ خَاسِرَةٌ (tropical:)  [Losing traffic;
traffic which is an occasion of loss]; opposed to
رَابِحَةٌ. (A.) And صَفْقَةٌ خَاسِرَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A bargain that
does not bring gain [but on the contrary occasions
loss]. (TA.) And كَرَّةٌ خَاسِرَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  An unprofitable
charge or assault. (K.) ―
-b2-  One who has lost his
property, and his intellect. (IAar.) ―
-b3-  Erring;
going astray; deviating from, or losing, or missing, the right way: or becoming lost; perishing;
or dying: syn. ضَالٌّ: (K:) and so ↓ خَسِرٌ (TA)
and ↓ خَسِيرٌ and ↓ خَيْسَرَى, (K, TA, but the last
written in the CK خَيْسَرِىٌّ,) or ↓ خَيْسَرٌ, for it is
said to occur [as an epithet] only in the following
saying, in which خَيْسَرَى is said to be put for
خَيْسَرٌ to assimilate it to preceding words: بِفِيهِ
البَرَى وَ حُمَّى خَيْبَرَى وَ شَرٌّ مَا يَرَى فَإِنَّهُ خَيْسَرَى [In
his mouth be dust, and may the fever of Kheyber
befall him, and evil be that which he shall see,
for he is one who goeth astray: but in the TA,
in art. ورى, is another reading; for بفيه البرى,
substituting بِهِ الوَرَى, meaning a certain disease].
(TA.) [Hence,] أَحْمَقُ خَاسِرٌ دَابِرٌ دَامِرٌ [Foolish,
or stupid, erring, and utterly perishing]. (T in
art. بت. [See بَاتٌّ: and see also دَامِرٌ.]) ―

One who makes the measure, and the balance,

copies of the K, in other copies of the K ↓ الخَاسِرَةُ,
but correctly ↓ الخَنَاسِرُ, (TA,) The weak of mankind; (K, TA;) and the small, or little, of them;

unfaithfulness, or treachery; and of baseness,
ignobleness, ungenerousness, or meanness: (TA in
the present art.:) or اهل الجبانة; because of their
weakness; (TA in art. خنسر;) [as though meaning the people of cowardice (الجَبَانَة): or it may
mean the people of the burial-ground (الجَبَّانَة);
for, accord. to AHát, ↓ الخناسير signifies those
who conduct [to the burial-ground] the corpse or
the bier with the corpse; perhaps from خَنَاسِرُ
meaning “ small, or little, and weak men. ” (TA.)
