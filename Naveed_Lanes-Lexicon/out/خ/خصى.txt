خصى1
خَصَاهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. يَخْصِيهِ, (JK,
Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. خِصَآءٌ (JK, S, Mgh, Msb, K)
and خَصَآءٌ, mentioned, by MF, from Expositions
of the Fs, (TA,) and خَصْىٌ, agreeably with
analogy, occurs in a trad. of Esh-Shaabee, though
we have not heard it, (Mgh,) He drew forth, or
extracted, his testicles; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) [he
gelded, or castrated, him;] namely, a stallion,
(S,) a sheep or goat, or a horse or similar beast,
(Lth, JK, TA,) and a man or boy, (TA,) or a
slave. (Msb.) One says, بَرِئْتُ إِلَيْكَ مِنَ الخِصَآءِ
[I am irresponsible to thee for castration]. (S.)
―
-b2-  [Hence,] كَانَ جَوَادًا فَخُصِىَ [lit. He was a
fleet and excellent horse, and he was gelded];
meaning (tropical:)  he was rich, and he became poor.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  The poets term satire, and the act of
overcoming, خِصَآء: one of them says,
خَصَيْتُكَ يَا ابْنَ حَمْزَةَ بِالقَوَافِى
كَمَا يُخْصَى مِنَ الحَلَقِ الحِمَارُ
[(tropical:)  I have emasculated thee, O son of Hamzeh,
with rhymes, like as the he-ass is emasculated in
consequence of the disease termed حَلَق; for which,
it is asserted, (as is said in the TA, art. حلق,)
there is no remedy but gelding]. (IB, TA.)
4
اخصى [as though meaning (assumed tropical:)  He did away
with that which rendered him like one emasculated; the ا, app., having a privative property;]
(tropical:)  he learned one science. (Sgh, K, TA.) ―
-b2-  The
use of إِخْصَآءٌ [its inf. n.] in the sense of خِصَآءٌ
inf. n. of خَصَى is a mistake. (Mgh.)
8
اختصى He castrated himself; or made
himself a eunuch. (KL.)
خَصٍ Having a complaint of his خُصَى [or
testicles]. (K.)
خُصْىٌ; and the dual خُصْيَانِ: see خُصْيَةٌ, in five
places.
خِصْىٌ: see what next follows.
خُصْيَةٌ A testicle; (El-Umawee, S;) sing. of
خُصًى; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) it is [one] of the
organs of generation; (K;) well known; (Msb;)
and ↓ خِصْيَةٌ signifies the same, (S, K,) and so
does ↓ خُصْىٌ, (Msb, K,) and ↓ خِصْىٌ; (K;) and
خُصْوَةٌ is a dial. var., occurring in a trad., but is
extr.: (Sh, TA:) accord. to some, (Msb,) the
sing. is خُصْيَةٌ [alone], (T, Msb,) of the fem.
gender; (T, TA;) and the dual is ↓ خُصْيَانِ, (ElUmawee, T, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) of the masc.
gender, (T, TA,) without ت, (El-Umawee, S,
Mgh, Msb,) irreg., (El-Umawee, S, Msb,) like
أَلْيَانِ dual of أَلْيَةٌ, (El-Umawee, S,) and خُصْيَتَانِ
also, (T, Mgh, K,) this latter being sometimes
used, (T, Mgh,) though rarely, (MF on the
authority of the Expositions of the Fs,) both
mentioned by ISh: (T, TA:) AO says, I have
heard خُصْيَة, with damm, but I have not heard
↓ خِصْيَة, with kesr; and I have heard ↓ خُصْيَاهُ
[as the dual], though they did not use ↓ خُصْىٌ as
the sing.; (S;) IB, however, cites exs. of this
last as a sing.: (TA:) AA says that الخُصْيَتَانِ
signifies the two testicles; and ↓ اَخُصْيَانِ, the two
skins [which compose the scrotum, i. e.,] in which
are the two testicles; citing an ex. in which the
latter dual is used in this sense; (S;) and ISk
says the like; whereas IKoot makes الخُصْيَةُ to
signify [the scrotum, i. e.] the skin containing the
testicle. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  An earring (قُرْطٌ) in
the ear: (JK, Sgh, K:) thus called by way of
comparison: (TA:) pl. خُصًى. (JK.)
خِصْيَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
two places.
خَصِىٌّ Whose testicles have been drawn forth,
or extracted; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) [gelded, or
castrated; a eunuch;] applied to a sheep or goat,
and a horse or similar beast, (TA,) and a man
(S, TA) or boy, (TA,) or a slave; (Msb;) as
also ↓ مَخْصِىٌّ: (K:) pl. خِصْيَانٌ (S, Mgh, K)
and خِصْيَةٌ: (S, K:) in giving it the former pl.,
they liken it to a subst., like ظَلِيمٌ, of which the
pl. is ظِلْمَانٌ: so says Sb; meaning that فِعْلَانٌ
is generally the pl. of فَعِيلٌ as a subst. (TA.)
One says also خَصِىٌّ نَصِىٌّ; using the latter word
as an imitative sequent. (Lh, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also
(tropical:)  Poetry in which is no amatory effusion. (K,
TA.)
خَاصٍ [act. part. n. of 1]. They say, جَآءَ كَخَاصِى
العَيْرِ [lit. He came like the gelder of the ass],
meaning he came ashamed: (JK, and TA in
art. جوج:) and also, disappointed, or unsuccessful. (TA in that art.)
مَخْصًى The place of cutting [or gelding or castration]. (S.)
مَخْصِىٌّ: see خَصِىٌّ.
