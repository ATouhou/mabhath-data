خلنجخَلَنْجٌ a Persian word, arabicized, (S,) A kind
of tree, (S, K,) of the wood of which vessels are
made: (TA:) or any [bowl of the kinds called]
جَفْنَة and صَحْفَة, or other vessel, made of wood
having variegated streaks: (L:) pl. خَلَانِجُ.
(S, K.) The word is mentioned [in the S and K
in art. خلج; but] in the L and some other lexicons in a separate art., because all the letters of a
word which is not Arabic are regarded as radical.
(MF.)
