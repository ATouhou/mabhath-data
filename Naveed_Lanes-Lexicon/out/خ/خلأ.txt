خلأ1
خَلَأَتْ, (S, K,) aor.
خَلَاَ, (K,) inf. n. خَلْءٌ, (S,
K,) in an expos. of the Mo'allakát written خِلْءٌ,
(TA,) and خِلَآءٌ, (S, K,) with kesr and medd,
(S,) so accord. to IKoot and IKtt and 'Iyád and
IAth and Z and Hr, but in some copies of the K
خَلَآءٌ, and so many assert it to be, (TA,) and
خُلُوْءٌ, (K,) said of a she-camel, (S, K,) She lay
down, or kneeled and lay down, upon her breast:
(Lh, K:) or she was, or became, refractory, or
stopped and was refractory, (S, K,) and lay
down, or kneeled and lay down, upon her breast,
without disease or other like cause, (S,) and
would not move from her place: (Lh, K:) like
أَلَحَّ said of a he-camel, and حَرَنَ said of a horse:
(S:) the epithet applied to her that does thus is
↓ خَالِئٌ, (Lh, K,) without ة; (Lh;) and [app.
to her that does so much, or often,] ↓ خَلُوْءٌ. (K.)
And in like manner خَلَأَ is said of a he-camel;
(K;) accord. to ISh, only of a he-camel: (TA:) or
the verb is used only in speaking of a female [when
relating to a camel]: (K:) one should not say of
a he-camel خَلَأَ: (Az, S, Z, Sgh:) but it is also
said of a man, (K,) tropically, (TA,) inf. n. خُلُوْءٌ,
meaning (tropical:)  He moved not from his place. (K,
TA.) ―
