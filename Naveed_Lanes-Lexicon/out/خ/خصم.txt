خصم1
خَصِمَ, aor.
خَصَمَ, [inf. n., app., خَصَمٌ,] He contended in an altercation, disputed, or litigated, in
a valid, or sound, manner. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  See also 3:
―
-b3-  and 8.

خاصمهُ, inf. n. مُخَاصَمَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and
خِصَامٌ (S, Msb) and [quasi-inf. n.] خُصُومَةٌ, (K,)
the last said in the S to be a simple subst., (TA,)
He contended with him in an altercation, disputed with him, or litigated with him; (K, TA;)
i. q. نَازَعَهُ: (Mgh and Msb and K in art. نزع:)
accord. to El-Harállee, الخِصَامُ signifies the saying which the listener is made to hear, and which
is made to enter his ear-hole, such as may cause
him to refrain, or desist, from his assertion, and
his plea, or claim. (TA.) You say, خَاصَمْتُهُ
↓ فَخَصَمْتُهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *) aor. of the latter
أَخْصِمُهُ, with kesr, (S, K, *) or أَخْصُمُهُ, with
damm, (Mgh, Msb,) or not with damm, (S,) or
both these forms of the aor. are used, accord. to
AHei; the latter agreeable with analogy; (MF;)
the former anomalous; for the regular aor. of an unaugmented sound verb in a case of this kind is with
damm, (S, K,) as in the instance of عَالَمْتُهُ فَعَلَمْتُهُ,
aor. أَعْلُمُهُ; (S;) if it has not a faucial letter
(S, K) for its medial radical, (K,) in which case
it is with fet-h, as in the instance of فَاخَرْتُهُ
فَفَخَرْتُهُ, aor. أَفْخَرُهُ, (S, K,) accord. to the opinion
of Ks, but this is contr. to the opinion generally
held: (MF:) the inf. n. of خَصَمْتُهُ is خَصْمٌ:
(S, * TA:) and the meaning is, [I contended with
him in an altercation, or I disputed, or litigated,
with him, and] I overcame him in the altercation, &c. (Mgh, Msb.)
-A2-  خاصمهُ also signifies
He put it in, or by, the خُصْم, i. e. edge, or side,
of the bed. (TA.)
4
اخصمهُ He dictated to him his plea against
his adversary in an altercation or a dispute or
litigation, (JK, TA,) whereby he might overcome
the latter. (JK.)

تَخَاْصَمَ see the next paragraph, in two places.
8
اختصموا They contended in altercation, disputed, or litigated, one with another; (Msb,
TA;) i. q. ↓ تخاصموا; (S, K, TA;) both signifying as above. (TA.) He who reads يَخَصِّمُونَ
[in the Kur xxxvi. 49] means يَخْتَصِمُونَ; changing the ت into ص, and incorporating [it into the
other ص], and transferring its vowel to the خ:
some read يَخِصِّمُونَ, without transferring that
vowel; (S, K;) because a quiescent letter, when
it is made movent, is [regularly] made so with
kesr: (S:) AA slurred the vowel of the خ: the
pronunciation [يَخْصِّمُونَ] with two quiescent
letters together is incorrect: (S, K:) Hamzeh
read ↓ يَخْصِمُونَ, (S,) i. e., with the خ quiescent
and with kesr to the ص. (TA.) ―
-b2-  اِخْتَصَمَا إِلَيْهِ
They two applied to him for the decision of a
cause, each of them claiming the right. (TA in
art. قمط.) And إِلَيْهِ ↓ تُخُوصِمَ [An application
was made to him by litigants for the decision of a
cause]. (Mgh in art. دلو.)
-A2-  السَّيْفُ يَخْتَصِمُ جَفْنَهُ,
said by J to signify The sword cuts (lit. eats) its
scabbard, by reason of its sharpness, is a mistake;
the verb being correctly with ض, (K, * TA,)
dotted. (TA.)
خَصْمٌ An adversary in contention or altercation, in dispute, or in litigation; an antagonist;
a litigant: (JK, K, TA:) as also ↓ خَصِيمٌ: (JK,
S, K, TA:) the former is used alike as masc. and
fem. (S, Msb, K) and sing. (JK, S, Msb, K) and
dual (Msb, K) and pl.; (JK, S, Msb, K;) because
it is originally an inf. n.: (S, TA:) [see an ex.
of its use in a pl. sense in a verse cited voce
جَنَفٌ:] but it also has the dual form, خَصْمَانِ;
(S, Msb;) and the pl. خُصُومٌ (JK, S, Msb, K)
and خِصَامٌ (Msb) and perhaps أَخْصَامٌ, [which is
a pl. of pauc.,] or this may be pl. of خَصِمٌ: (TA:)
the pl. of ↓ خَصِيمٌ is خُصَمَآءُ (JK, S, K) and
خُصْمَانٌ. (K.)
خُصْمٌ The side (S, K) of anything; (S, TA;)
as, for instance, of a load such as is called عِدْل;
(S;) and of a bed; and the edge thereof: (TA:)
written by Aboo-Moosà with ض; but IAth says
that it is correctly with ص: (TA in art. خضم:)
a lateral part or portion (S, K) of anything:
(S:) a corner, (S, K,) as well as a side, (S,) of
an عِدْل, and of a receptacle, such as a خُرْج or
a جُوَالِق or an عَيْبَة: (S:) and the [anterior
lower] extremity of a [water-bag of the kind
termed] رَاوِيَة, that is opposite to the عَزْلَآء; (JK,
K, TA; [in the CK, الزّاوِيَةِ and الغَزْلاءِ are erroneously put for الرَّاوِيَةِ and العَزْلَآءِ;]) the upper
extremity [correctly extremities, at which are the
loops whereby it is suspended upon the side of
the camel,] being called the عصم [i. e. عُصْم, pl.
of عِصَامٌ]: (TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَخْصَامٌ and [of
mult.] خُصُومٌ: (K:) but some say that the أَخْصَام
of the [water-bag termed] مَزَادَة, and its خُصُوم,
are its corners: the خُصُوم of a cloud are its
sides: (TA:) and أَخْصَامُ العَيْنِ signifies the
part, or parts, of the eye upon which the edges
of the lids close together. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  [Also A
gap, or an intervening space: it is said in the
TA that] الأَخْصَامُ [pl. of الخُصْمُ] signifies الفرج
[i. e. الفُرَجُ, pl. of الفُرْجَةُ: and it is added,] one
says, of an unsound, a corrupt, or a disordered,
affair, لَا يُسَّدُ مِنْهُ خُصْمٌ إِلَّا انْفَتَحَ خُصْمٌ آخَرُ (tropical:)  [A
gap of it will not be stopped up but another gap
will open]; occurring in a trad., meaning, the
state of affairs is disordered and distressing, and
not to be rectified and repaired. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [The
pl.] خُصُومٌ also signifies The mouths of valleys.
(JK, K.) ―
-b4-  And The lower parts, or stocks,
syn. أُصُولٌ, (JK, K,) of [trees of the kind called]
سَرَحَات [pl. of سَرْحَةٌ]; used in this sense by Et-
Tirimmáh. (JK.)
خَصِمٌ Vehement in altercation or dispute or
litigation; (S, K, * TA;) as also ↓ خَصُومٌ: (Ham
p. 628:) [or each signifies contentious, disputatious,
or litigious:] or the former, knowing, or skilled,
in altercation &c., though not practising it:
(IB, TA:) or valid, or sound, therein; as also
↓ خَصِيمٌ: (Msb:) or this last signifies one who
contends with another in an altercation, disputes
with him, or litigates with him: (IB, TA:) the
pl. of the first is خَصِمُونَ, (K,) occurring in the
Kur xliii. 58; and perhaps أَخْصَامٌ, or this may
be a pl. of خَصْمٌ. (TA.)
خَصْمَةٌ A certain bead, or gem, or the like, used
by men [as an amulet], in the K, مِنْ حُرُوزِ الرِّجَالِ,
but correctly, as in the M, مِنْ خَزَرِ الرِّجَالِ, (TA,)
worn on the occasion of contending in an altercation, or disputing, or litigating, or on going
into the presence of the Sultán; (K, TA;) and
sometimes it is beneath the gem of the man's signetring, when it is small; and it may be in his
button; and sometimes they put it in the ذُؤَابَة
[or cord by which the hilt is occasionally attached
to the guard] of the sword: (TA:) also called
خَضْمَةٌ. (K and TA in art. خضم.)

litigation; (K, TA;) a subst. from 3 (S, TA)
or 8 (JK, * TA) and 6, as also ↓ خُصْمَةٌ and

أُخْصُومٌ The loop of the [sack called] جُوَالِق,
(JK, TA,) and of the [load called] عِدْل; (TA;)
i. q. أُخْسُومٌ; (K;) but the latter is a dial. var.
of weak authority, and disapproved. (TA in art.
خسم.)
