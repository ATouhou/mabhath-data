خدج1
خَدَجَتْ, aor.
خَدِجَ (S, Msb, K) and
خَدُجَ, (K,)
inf. n. خِدَاجٌ, (S, K, *) or this is a simple subst.,
(Msb,) She (a camel, AZ, S, Msb, K, and any
cloven-hoofed or solid-hoofed animal, AZ, Msb,
TA, or sometimes another female, TA) cast her
young one before the completion of the days of
gestation, (AZ, IKt, S, Msb, K,) to which IKoot
adds, (Msb,) even if it were completely formed;
(S, Msb;) as also خَدَجَتْ وَلَدَهَا; (IKtt, Msb;)
and ↓ خدّجت, inf. n. تَخْدِيجٌ: (TA:) or, as
some say, she cast her young one when her pregnancy had become apparent, between the commencement of its formation and the period a
little before the completion; as also ↓ اخدجت
وَلَدَهَا; but see the latter verb below: (Msb:) or
she (a camel) cast her young one in a defective
state, before the time: or without any hair upon
it: or miscarried, bringing forth merely blood:
and Thábit mentions the last but one of these
significations as relating to a human being: (TA:)
or you say of a woman, خَدَجَتْ وَلَدَهَا and
↓ أَخْدَجَتْهُ in one and the same sense, (Aboo-Kheyreh, TA,) meaning she cast her fœtus in
such a state that its form had become apparent:
and خَدَجَتْ she miscarried, bringing forth merely
blood: when she has brought it forth before its
hair has grown, one says of her غَضَنَتْ: so says
Az. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And خَدَجَ (tropical:)  He (a man) was, or
became, deficient in a limb, or member. (A.) ―
