خطف1
خَطِفَهُ, aor.
خَطَفَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n.
خَطْفٌ; (S, TA;) this is the approved form of
the verb; (T, S;) and خَطَفَهُ, aor.
خَطِفَ, (S, Msb,
K,) inf. n. as above; (Msb;) a form of the verb
mentioned by Akh, (S,) but this is rare, (S, K,)
or (K) bad, (S, K,) scarcely, or not at all, known;
(S;) and ↓ اختطفهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) and
↓ تخطّفهُ; (S Msb, TA;) He seized it; or took
it, or carried it off, by force: (S, K:) or he did
so quickly; snatched it away: (Mgh, Msb, TA:)
and ↓ خطّف has been said to imply repetition of
the action [unless it be a variation of اختطف as
in a case mentioned below]; but this is strange,
and not known on any other authority than that
of the “ Akáneem et-Taaleem ” by El-Khuweiyee,
a disciple of El-Fakhr Er-Rázee. (MF, TA.)
Hence, in the Kur [xxix. 67],وَيُتَخَطَّفُ ↓ النَّاسُ  
مِنْ حَوْلِهِمْ CCC [And men are carried off by force
from around them]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [And hence,]
هٰذَا سَيْفٌ يَخْطَفُ الرَّأْسَ (tropical:)  [This is a sword that
will strike off the head]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And خَطِفَ
البَصَرَ and خَطَفَهُ, said of lightning, (K,) and
of a ray of light, and of a [glistening] sword,
and of any polished body, (TA,) (tropical:)  It took
away the sight: (K, TA:) and ↓اُخْتُطِفَ
بَصَرُهُ (tropical:) His sight was suddenly taken away.
(M and K in art. ملس.) It is said in the
Kur [ii. 19], يَكَادُ البَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَارَهُمْ (tropical:) [The
lightning almost taketh away their sight, lit.
sights]: (TA:) Yoo read يَخْطِفُ ابصارهم; (S,
TA;) and so did Aboo-Rejà and Mujáhid: and
some read ↓يِخِطِّفُ, and ↓يَخَطِّفُ, originally
يَخْتَطِفُ, accord. to the opinion of the Basrees,
disputed by Fr, but confirmed by Zj. (TA.) ―
-b4-
And خَطِفَ السَّمْعَ, (K,) aor.
خَطَفَ, (S,) said of a
devil, (tropical:)  He stole [an opportunity of] hearing [the
speech of the angels, from the confines of the
lowest Heaven; or snatched it]; (S, K, TA;)
as also ↓اختطفهُ: (K:) the two verbs being like
نَزَعَهُ and اِنْتَزَعَهُ. (Sb, TA.) Hence, in the Kur
[xxxvii. 10], ↓إِلَّا مَنْ خَطِفَ الخَطْفَةَ (tropical:)  Except
him who steals the [opportunity of] hearing:
(TA:) or who snatches unawares and by stealth,
(Bd,) or hears and snatches, (Jel,) the speech of
the angels: (Bd, Jel:) EL-Hasan read ↓ الّا من خَطَّفَ
الخطفة,  originally اخْتَطَفَ: (S, TA:)
and another reading, ascribed to him and others,
is ↓خِطِّفَ; but this is very weak. (TA.) ―
-b5-

خَطَفَ; and خَطَفَ, aor.

مَرَّ يَخْطَفُ خَطْفًا مُنْكَرًا (assumed tropical:)  He went along at a quick

cast; expl. by إِذَا كَانَ يَصِيدُهَا [perhaps a mistranscription for يُصِيبُهَا, and, if so, meaning he hit].
(JK.) And اخطف said of an arrow, (assumed tropical:)  [It missed:
or it fell upon the ground, and then glided along
upon the ground to the butt, or object of aim:
(see خَاطِفٌ:) and] it went straight. (TA.) ―

the prey of whatever snatches away the prey, and
goes away with it, not withholding it for its
owner: or, as some say, what snatches away with

while the animal is alive: (Mgh, TA:) or the
limb, or member, which the beast or bird of prey

cuts off, from the beast that is alive: (K, TA:)

(Mgh, TA,) unlawful to be eaten: the prohibition
originated from the Prophet's finding, when he
came to El-Medeeneh, that the people loved and
ate the humps of camels and the tails of sheep:
(TA:) the reading الخَطَفَة, of the measure فَعَلَة,
with fet-h to the medial radical letter, as pl. of
خَاطِفٌ, is a mistake. (Mgh.) ―
