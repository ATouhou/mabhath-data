خَزْقٌ inf. n. of 1. (S, * Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  [I also
find in the TA, الخزق ما يثبت والخزق ماينفذ, as
though meaning that خَزْقٌ signifies A thing that
becomes fixed or fast: and also a thing that transpierces, or passes through: but these may be loose
explanations, intended to mean that خَزْقٌ is said
of that which becomes fixed or fast (as an arrow
in the body pierced by it), and also of that which
transpierces, or passes through: see خَسَقَ, of
which the inf. n., خَسْقٌ, is said to be used in these
two senses.]
