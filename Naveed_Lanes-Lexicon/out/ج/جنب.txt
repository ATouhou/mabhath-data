(K:) or the part of a man that is beneath the
arm-pit, extending to the flank; as also ↓ جَانِبٌ,
because it is the side of the person: (Msb:) pl.
(of the first, Msb) جُنُوبٌ (Msb, K) and [of the
same, a pl. of pauc.,] أَجْنَابٌ (CK) and [of جَانِبٌ]
جَوَانِبُ (Lh, ISd, K, but not in the CK) and
[app. of جَنْبٌ (like as لَيَائِلُ is a pl. of لَيْلٌ) or of
جَنَبَةٌ (like as حَوَائِجُ is pl. of حَاجَةٌ which is originally حَوَجَةٌ) or of both these] ↓ جَنائِبُ (M, K,)
which is extr. (M, TA.) [Hence,] قَعَدْتُ إِلَى
جَنْبِ فُلَانٍ and فلان ↓ الى جَانِبِ [I sat by the
side of such a one]: both meaning the same. (S.)
And ↓ إِنَّهُ لَمُنْتَفِخُ الجَوَانِبِ [Verily he is inflated
in the side]: جوانب being here one of those
words which are used in the sing. sense though
in the pl. form. (Lh, TA.) And أَعْطَاهُ الجَنْبَ
[lit. He gave him the side; meaning] he was, or
became, submissive, manageable, easy, or tractable, to him. (A.) And جَارُ الجَنْبِ He who
cleaves to one, keeping by one's side. (K. [Differing from جَارُ الجُنُبِ, q. v. infrà.]) And الصَّاحِبُ
بِالجَنْبِ [in the Kur iv. 40] The travelling-companion; the companion in a journey: (S, K:)
or he who is near one; or by one's side: or the
companion in every good affair: or the husband:
or the wife. (TA.) And ذَاتُ الجَنْبِ, (S, A,
Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,) with which ↓ الجُنَابُ is syn.,
(K,) [and sometimes الجَنْبُ, as will be seen in
what follows,] A well-known disease; (Mgh;)
[the pleurisy; called by the first of these three
appellations in the present day;] a severe disease,
being an inflammatory tumour in the [pleura, or]
membrane within the ribs: (Msb:) or an ulcer,
or a purulent pustule, that comes within a man's
side: (S, TA:) it is a severe disease in the side:
accord. to El-Hejeree, it is in either side; and
they assert that when it is in the left side, the
patient perishes: accord. to ISh, the دُبَيْلَة; which
is an ulcer that penetrates into the belly: or the
ulcer (دُبَيْلَة and دُمَّل) that comes forth within
the side, and discharges internally; the sufferer
from which seldom recovers: he who suffers from
it [and dies in consequence], or, as some say, he
who is afflicted by a complaint of the side (absolutely) while warring in the cause of God, is
reckoned a martyr: (TA:) [soldiers in a campaign are notoriously more subject to it than persons
in most other circumstances; and it is app. for
this reason that] it is termed دَآءُ الصَّنَادِيدِ [the
disease of the courageous chiefs]. (A, TA.) ذُو
الجَنْبِ, of which ذَاتُ الجُنْبِ is the fem., signifies
Having a complaint of his side by reason of [the
disease above mentioned, or what is termed] الدُّبَيْلَة.
(TA. [See also مَجْنُوبٌ.]) ―
-b2-  A poet says,
النَّاسُ جَنْبٌ وَالأَمِيرُ جَنْبُ
[The people are a side and the prince is a side]:
(Akh, S, TA:) as though he reckoned the latter
equal to all the people. (TA. [This is cited in
the S and TA as though it were an ex. of جنب
in the sense here next following: but it seems to
be rather an ex. of this word in the sense first
explained in the present paragraph.]) ―
-b3-  I. q.
نَاحِيَةٌ [A side; meaning a lateral, or an outward
or adjacent, part or portion, region, quarter, or

K;) as also ↓ جَانِبٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ جَنَابٌ
and ↓ جَنْبَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ جَنَبَةٌ (S) and ↓ جَنَابَةٌ.
(L, TA.) It is said that the primary signification
of جَنْبٌ is the part of the body mentioned in the
beginning of this paragraph, and that its use in the
sense of نَاحيَةٌ is metaphorical, as is the case of
يَمِينٌ and شِمَالٌ; but نَاحِيَةٌ is mentioned in the
Msb as the primary signification of ↓ جَانِبٌ;
(MF, TA;) though its primary signification accord. to the K and ISd seems to be that first
mentioned. (TA.) You say, ↓ مَشَوْا جَانِبَيْهِ and
↓ جَنَابَيْهِ and ↓ جَنْبَتَيْهِ and ↓ جَنَابَتَيْهِ [They walked,
or went on foot, on either side of him]. (A, TA. *)
And ↓ مَرُّوا يَسِيرُونَ جَنَابَيْهِ (S, L) and ↓ جَنْبَتَيْهِ
and ↓ جَنَابَتَيْهِ (L, TA) They went along journeying on either side of him. (S, L.) And كُنَّا عَنْهُمْ
↓ جَنَا بَيْنِ and ↓ جَنَابًا We were apart from them
[on two sides and on one side]. (TA.) And نَزَلُوا
الوَادِى ↓ فِى جَنَابَاتِ [They alighted in the sides of
the valley, or in the tracts beside the valley]. (A.)
And ↓ فُلَانٌ لَا يَطُورُ بِجَنَبَتِنَا Such a one will not
approach our quarter: (S:) thus accord. to AO;
with fet-h to the ن: IJ, however, says, people
are wont to say, ↓ أَنَا فِى ذَرَاكَ وَجَنَبَتِكَ [meaning
I am under thy protection and in thy quarter];
but that the correct expression is ↓ جَنْبَتِكَ, with
the ن quiescent. (IB, TA.) The Arabs also
said, سُهَيْلٍ ↓ الحَرُّ جَانِبَىْ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  The heat is
on either side of Suheyl [or Canopus: i. e., during
the period next before, and that next after, the
auroral rising of Canopus; which rising began,
in central Arabia, at the commencement of the
era of the Flight, about the 4th of August,
O. S.]: this is the greatest heat. (TA.) One
also says, ↓ أَحَاطُوا بِهِ مِنْ جَانِبَيْهِ [meaning They
surrounded him on all his sides; lit., on his two
sides]; dividing the surrounding parts into two,
but not meaning that any of these remained
vacant. (Expos. of the exs. cited as testimonies
by Sb, TA in art. حول.) ―
-b4-  Also, [and ↓ جَانِبٌ,
which is thus used in the L in art. جنح, and by
many authors,] A part, or portion, of a thing;
(L;) the greater, or main, or chief, part or
portion thereof; most thereof; (L, K;) or a great
part or portion thereof; much thereof. (L.)
Hence, [or perhaps from جَنْبٌ in the second of
the senses assigned to it above, conveying the
idea of juxtaposition, and thus of comparison,]
هٰذَا قَلِيلٌ جَنْبِ مَوَدَّتِكَ [This is little in comparison with the magnitude of thy love; or
simply, in comparison with thy love]. (TA.) ―
-b5-
يَا حَسْرَتَا عَلَى مَا فَرَّطْتُ فِى جنْبِ اللّٰهِ [in the Kur
xxxix. 57] means ↓ فى جَانِبِه, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [O my grief,
or regret, for my negligence, or remissness,] in
respect of that which is the right, or due, of
God! (A, Bd, TA,) i. e., (Bd,) in respect of
obedience to God! (Bd, Jel:) or, in respect of
[the means of attaining] nearness to God! (Fr,
TA;) or, nearness to God in Paradise! (IAar,
TA:) or, in respect of the way of God, to which
He hath called me! i. e., the profession of his
unity, and the confession of the prophetic office
of Mohammad. (Zj, TA.) The saying of the
Arabs, اِتَّقِ اللّٰهَ فِى جَنْبِهِ وَلَا تَقْدَحْ فِى سَاقِهِ [may
be rendered (assumed tropical:)  Fear God in respect of his (thy
brother's) right, or due, and impugn not his
honour, or reputation: or] means, accord. to the
copies of the K, لَا تَقْتُلْهُ [slay him not], or, as in
the L, and in the original draught of the author
[of the K] لا تَغْتَلْهُ [slay him not clandestinely,
or on an occasion of inadvertence], from الغِيلَةُ,
and throw him not into trouble, or trial: (TA:)
or, accord. to some, فى جنبه means in detracting
from his reputation, or reviling him. (K, TA.
[See also Freytag's Arab. Prov. i. 240.]) A poet,
cited by IAar, says,
خَلِيلَىَّ كُفَّا وَاذْكُرَا اللّٰهَ فِى جَنْبِى
(assumed tropical:)  [O my two friends, refrain, and be mindful
of God in respect of my reputation; (see also
جَانِبٌ;)] meaning, in detracting from my reputation, or reviling me: or, accord. to MF, in my
case. (TA.) And one says, مَا فَعَلْتَ فِى جَنْبِ
حَاجَتِى (assumed tropical:)  What didst thou, or what hast thou
done, in the case of the thing that I want? (L,

others: (K, TA:) and in a trad., in which it is
enjoined, used as meaning retirement from women;
avoiding the sitting by them, and the approaching
the place that they occupy. (TA.) You say,

spring]: (S, K:) or every kind of plant that produces leaves in that season without rain: (TA:)
or a name given to many plants, all of them عُرُوق
[perhaps meaning resembling roots, i. e. straggling, or spreading like roots]; so called because
less than large trees and higher than those that
have no root-stock (أَرُومَة) in the earth; comprising the نَصِىّ and صِلِّيَان and حَمَاط and مَكْر
and حذر [so in the TA, but I do not find it elsewhere, and think it may be a mistranscription for
حَزْر, of which حَزْرَة (the name of a certain sour
tree) is probably the n. un.,] and دَهْمَآء; which
are smaller than شَجَر and superior to بُقُول: all
this has been heard from the Arabs: (T, TA:) or
green and fresh صلّيان: (TA:) or what is [of a
kind] between بَقْل and شَجَر; (AHn, K, TA;)
being [in the TA وهما, but this is evidently a
mistake for وَهِىَ,] of the kind of which the root
remains in the winter while the branches perish:

in the earth; such as the نَصِىّ and the صِلِّيَان.
