that the reading which I have adopted is right

bad]: and Lh mentions the saying, لَمْ أَرَ النَّفَقَةَ
تَجُوزُ بِمَكَانٍ كَمَا تَجُوزُ بِمَكَّةَ [I have not seen

A rájiz says,
خَلُّوا الطَّرِيقَ عَنْ أَبِى سَيَّارَهْ
حَتَّى يُجِيزَ سَالِمًا حِمَارَهْ
[Leave ye the road to Aboo-Seiyárah until he

authority or degree of a licentiate in some one
or more of the various departments of learning, for the instruction of others therein;] he

also, اجاز لِفُلَانٍ جَمِيعَ مَسْمُوعَاتِهِ مِنْ مَشَائِخِهِ [He
ters which he had heard from his sheykhs, to teach
the same to others]. (TA.) The licentiate is termed

(Mgh.) And [in like manner] اجاز رَأْيَهُ, and
↓ جوّزهُ, He made his judgment, or opinion, to have
effect; he executed or performed it. (K.) Hence
the saying, in a trad. of Aboo-Dharr, قَبْلَ أَنْ

-A3-  أَجَازَنِى (S,
K *) (tropical:)  He gave me water for, (S,) or he watered

أَجَازَهُ مَآءً يَجُوزُ بِهِ الطَّرِيقَ (assumed tropical:)  He gave him water
wherewith to travel the road. (A.) And أَجِزْنِى
مَآءً Give thou me some water that I may go my

Hence, (Aboo-Bekr, TA,) اجازهُ بِجَائِزَةٍ, (Aboo-Bekr, TA,) and اجازهُ بِجَائِزَةٍ سَنِيَّةٍ, (S, A,) (assumed tropical:)  He
(the Sultán) gave him a gift, or present, (Aboo-Bekr, TA,) and he gave him a gift, or present, of
high estimation. (S, A. *) Or the origin of the
expression was this: Katan the son of 'Owf, of
the tribe of Benoo-Hilál-Ibn-'Ámir-Ibn-Saasa'ah,
gave the government of Fáris to 'Abd-Allah Ibn-
'Abbás; and El-Ahnaf passing by him with his
army on an expedition to Khurásán, he waited
for them upon a bridge, and said, أَجِيزُوهُمْ [Make
ye them to pass over]; and he began to mention
the lineage of each man and to give him according
to his rank: (S:) or from the fact that a certain
commander, having a river between him and an
opposing force, said, مَنْ جَازَ هٰذَا النَّهْرَ فَلَهُ كَذَا
[Whoso passeth this river shall have such a thing];
and whenever one passed over, he received a
جَائِزَة. (TA.) You say also, أَجَازَهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He
gave him. (TA.) And it is said in a trad.,
أَجِيزُوا الوَفْدَ بِنَحْوِ مَا كُنْتُ أُجِيزُهُمْ بِهِ Give ye to
the party who come as envoys, or the like, a
similar جَائِزَة to that which I used to give them.

remitted, in his prayer; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, TA;)
and so in other things; (A;) and abridged it;
and was quick in it: said to be from الجَوْزُ “the
act of traversing, and going, or passing along:”
(TA:) or did less than was sufficient in it.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  Hence, تجوّز فِى أَخْذِ الدَّرَاهِمِ, (A,
Mgh,) or تجوّز الدَّرَاهِمَ, (K,) He accepted the
dirhems, or pieces of money, as current; did not
reject them: (A, Mgh:) see 1: or he accepted
them as they were, or notwithstanding what was
in them: (Lth, TA:) or he accepted them notwithstanding what was intermixed with them,
(K, TA,) [of bad money,] concealed therein, and
notwithstanding their fewness. (TA.) In the
phrase التَّجَوُّزُ بِدُونِ الحَقِّ [The accepting less
than what was due], the inf. n. is made trans.
by means of بِ because it implies the meaning
of الرِّضَا [which is made trans. by the same means].
(Mgh.) ↓ تَجَاوَزْ also occurs in the sense of تَجَوَّزْ
in a trad. of Ibn-Rawáhah: هٰذَا لَكَ وَتَجَاوَزْ فِى
القَسْمِ This is thine, or for thee, and be thou
remiss, or not extreme, in, or with respect to, the
division: and is allowable, though we have not
heard it. (Mgh.) You say also, تَجَوَّزَ فِى هٰذَا
الأَمْرِ مَا لَمْ يَتَجَوَّزْ فِى غَيْرِهِ He bore patiently, or

(S, A, Mgh;) and تجاوزعَنْ ذَنْبِهِ, (A, K,) and
↓ تجوّز, and ↓ جاوز; (K;) He (God, S, A, or a
man, Msb) passed him by, or over, without punishing him; or forgave him; (S, A, Mgh, Msb;)
namely, an evil-doer; (A, Mgh, Msb;) and He
passed by, or over, without punishing, or forgave,
his sin or offence. (A, K. *) You say, اَللّٰهُمَّ تَجَاوَزْ
عَنِّى, and عَنِّى ↓ تَجَوَّزْ, O God, pass me by, or
over, without punishing me; or forgive me. (S,
A.) تجاوز عَنْهُ, followed by a noun in the accus.
case, also signifies He forgave him a thing. (L.)

of it; he connived at it. (K.) ―

جَوَازٌ (assumed tropical:)  The act of watering, or giving to drink:

&c.;) what passes beyond the meaning to which
it is originally applied; (TA;) [being of the
measure مَفْعَلٌ in the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ;]
contr. of حَقِيقَةٌ. (K.) [This is also called مَجَازٌ
لُغَوِىٌّ, and مَجَازٌ لُغَةً; to distinguish it from what
is termed مَجَازٌ عُرْفِىٌّ, and مَجَازٌ عُرْفًا, which is A
word, or phrase, so little used in a particular
proper sense as to be, in that sense, conventionally
regarded as tropical; as, for instance, دَابَّةٌ in
the sense of “ a man,” or “ a human being; ”
it being commonly applied to “ a beast,” and
especially to “ a horse ” or “ a mule ” or “ an
ass. ”] A حَقِيقَة, when little used, becomes what
is termed مَجَازٌ عُرْفًا. (Mz, 24th نوع.) The مَجَاز
