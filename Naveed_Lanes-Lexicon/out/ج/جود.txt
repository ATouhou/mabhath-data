or جاد بِالمَالِ he affected, or constrained himself,

بِالجَوْدِوَفَوْقهَا [Thou hast assailed us with a storm
of reproach or the like not to be exceeded, and
with that which is above it,] is one of hyperbole
and reproach. (M, L.) It is an inf. n. thus used
as an epithet [and therefore applicable without
variation to a fem. as to a masc. n., and to a dual
and a pl. as to a sing. n.]: (L:) and is also pl.
[or rather a quasi-pl. n.] of جَائِدٌ, (S, L, K,) like
as صَحْبٌ is of صَاحِبٌ. (S, L.) You say مَطَرٌ جَوْدٌ

[Two showers of rain, copious, or abundant, &c.].
(S, K.) ↓ تَجَاوِيدُ, [app. signifying the same as

verse of Sakhr El-Ghei,
يُلَاعِبُ الرِّيحَ بِالعَصْرَيْنِ قَصْطَلُهُ
وَالوَابِلُونَ وَتَهْتَانُ التَّجَاوِيدِ
[Its dust makes sport with the wind in the morning and evening, or night and day, and so do
the violent showers of big drops, and the pouring
of copious, or abundant, rains, &c.], (L, K, *) is
a pl. having no sing.; (K;) or it may be so,
like تَعَاجِيبُ and تَعَاشِيبُ and تَبَاشِيرُ; or it may
be pl. of تَجْوَادٌ [an inf. n.]. (L.) You say also,
امَطَرِ ↓ أَصَابَتْهُ تَجَاوِيدُ [Copious showers of rain
fell upon him, or it]. (A.) ―

Liberal, bountiful, munificent, or generous: (S, *
K:) or one who affects, or constrains himself, to
be generous: (Msb:) or who gives without being
asked, to preserve the receiver from the ignominy
of asking: (MF:) or who gives what is meet to
him to whom it is meet: (El-Karmánee, TA:) or
who gives what is meet to him to whom it is meet,
not for a compensation; so that it has a more
special signification than مُحْسِنٌ: (MF:) pl. [of
pauc., masc.,] أَجْوَادٌ and (of mult., TA) جُوْدٌ,
(S, A, K,) like as قُذُلٌ is pl. of قَذَالٌ, but the و
is made quiescent because it is an unsound letter,
(S,) [in some copies of the K جُوُدٌ,] and أَجَاوِدُ,
(S, K,) contr. to analogy, (TA,) or أَجَاوِيدُ,
[reg., as pl. of أَجْوَادٌ,] (A,) and جُوَدَآءُ (S, K)
and جُوَدَةٌ, (CK, [in some copies of the K omitted,])
or جُوْدَةٌ, or جُوُدَةٌ, [written in the latter manner
in a MS. copy of the K,] with ة added to the
[proper] pl. form [جُوْدٌ or جُوُدٌ], accord. to the
doctrine of Sb: (TA:) جُوْدٌ is used as a fem. pl.,
(S, Msb,) and is like نُوْرٌ pl. of نَوَارٌ. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also,
applied alike to the male and the female, (S,) A
courser; a fleet, or swift, and excellent, horse;
(L;) a horse fleet, or swift, in running; or excellent in running, or in the motion of his legs;
as also ↓ جَوْدٌ: (Bd in xxxviii. 30:) or that outstrips others: (Jel ib.:) i. q. رَائِعٌ: (S, L, K:)
pl. جِيَادٌ, (S, A, Bd, L, Msb, K,) which by rule
should be جِوَادٌ, like طِوَالٌ, but this latter form
has not been heard from the Arabs; (L;) or
جِيَادٌ is pl. of جَوْدٌ, or of جَيِّدٌ; (Bd ubi suprá;)
and جَوَادٌ has also for its pl. أَجْيَادٌ, [a pl. of pauc.,
and irregular, or this is pl. of جَيّدٌ, and therefore,
though irregularly, retains the ى substituted for
و] (S, L,) and أَجْوَادٌ, [also a pl. of pauc., but
agreeable with rule, or this is pl. of جَوْدٌ,] (L,)
and أَجَاوِيدُ (S, L) is pl. of أَجْوَادٌ. (L.) Hence,
أَقْبَلَ جَوَادًا (assumed tropical:)  He came on, or advanced, like a horse
that is termed جواد: and سِرْتُ إِلَيْهِ جَوَادًا (assumed tropical:)  I went

or stage, and two long marches or stages, and long
marches or stages. (S, A, TA.)
جُوَادٌ [accord. to the TA inf. n. of جِيدَ, which
see in two places,] (assumed tropical:)  Thirst: (S, K:) or vehemence
of thirst. (K.) ―
-b2-  Also, [accord. to the K ↓ جَوْدَةٌ,
but this is corrected in the TA,] (assumed tropical:)  Drowsiness, or
slumber. (TA.)
جَائِدٌ: see جَوْدٌ.
جَيِّدٌ, originally of the measure فَيْعِلٌ, (S, Msb,)
as the Basrees say, i. e. جَيْوِدٌ, (Msb, TA,) the و
being changed into ى because of its being meksoor
and preceded by ى, and the augmentative ى
being then incorporated into it; (TA;) or, as the
Koofees say, of the measure فَيْعَلٌ, like عَيْطَلٌ &c.,
because there is found no sound word of the
measure فَيْعِلٌ except صَيْقِلٌ, a woman's name, and
the unsound is accorded to the sound; or, as
others say, of the measure فَعِيلٌ, [and so I find in
one copy of the S,] originally جَوِيدٌ, the kesreh
of the و being, accord. to them, suppressed because
difficult of pronunciation, and the quiescent و and
ى thus coming together, [the latter receives the
rejected kesreh, and] the و is changed into ى and
incorporated into the [augmentative] ى; (Msb;)
Good, goodly, approvable, or excellent; contr. of
رَدِ ىْ; (A, K;) applied to a thing, (S,) or a
commodity, an article of household-goods, or the
like, (A, Msb,) and a work, or performance:
(TA:) pl. جِيَادٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and جِيَادَاتٌ, (K,)
the latter a pl. pl., [i. e. pl. of جِيَادٌ,] (TA,) and
جَيَائِدُ, (S, K,) with hemz, [and, accord. to some,]
contr. to analogy. (S.) [It is also applied to a
man, meaning Excellent, or egregious, in some
quality; sometimes, though very rarely, in a
quality that is disapproved.]

goodly or approvable or excellent]: see 5. ―

q. v.]. (A, TA.) ―
-b3-  حَتْفٌ مُجِيدٌ (tropical:)  Present death.

مِجْوَادٌ One who says, utters, or expresses, or
who does, (K, TA,) much, or often, (TA,) what
is good, goodly, approvable, or excellent; (K,
TA;) as also ↓ مُجِيدٌ: (TA:) [or rather the
latter is a simple, not an intensive, epithet:] the
former is applied to a poet, (S, A, K,) as syn.
with the latter, (K,) or as meaning who says, or
utters, much, or often, what is good, or excellent:
(S:) and both are applied to a workman, or an
artificer: pl. of the former مَجَاوِيدُ. (A.)
