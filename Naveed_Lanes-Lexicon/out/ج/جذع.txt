اجذع, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِجْذَاعٌ,
(Mgh, Msb,) He (a beast) became such as is
denoted by the term جَذَعٌ; (TA;) said of the
offspring of the sheep or goat, he became in his
second year; of that of the cow, and of a solidhoofed beast, he became in his third year; and of
that of the camel, he became in his fifth year:
(S, Msb, K:) but sometimes, when said of the
offspring of the ewe, it means he became six
months old, or nine months old; and such is allowable as a victim for sacrifice: (S:) IAar says, it
denotes a time, not a tooth (Mgh, Msb) growing
or falling out: (Msb:) and said of a she-goat,
اجذعت means she became a year old, and sometimes, less than a year, by reason of plenty of
food; and of a sheep, اجذع means, when from
young parents, he became from six months old to
seven; and when from very old parents, from
eight months old to ten. (Mgh, Msb.) [See

or, accord to some, only after it has become dry:
or, accord. to some, only after it has been cut:
(TA:) or the trunk of a tree when the head has
gone: (Ham p. 656:) in the Kur, xix. 23, it is
applied to the trunk of a palm-tree which had
become dry and was without a head; (Bd;)

the contrary: (TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أجْذَاعٌ (Msb)
and [of mult.] جُذُوعٌ. (S, Msb.) ―
-b2-  The beam of

جَذَعٌ A beast (Lth, Mgh) before the ثَنِىّ [q. v.],

and جِذَاعٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and جُذَاعٌ; (Yoo,
O;) and pl. fem. جَذَعَاتٌ: (S, Msb:) it is a
name applied to the beast in a particular time, not
denoting a tooth growing or falling out: (S, K:)
but it differs in its application to different kinds
of beasts: (Az:) applied to a sheep or goat,
it means a year old; (IAar;) in his second
year: (Mgh:) or, applied to a sheep, a year
old; and sometimes less than a year, by reason
of plenty of food; (IAar;) or eight months
old, (Az, Mgh, TA,) or nine; (TA;) or, when
from young parents, from six months old to
seven; and when from very old parents from
eight months old to ten; (IAar, Mgh;) and the
sheep thus called is a satisfactory victim for sacrifice: (Mgh, TA:) and applied to a goat, a year
old; (Az, Mgh;) or in its second year; (AZ;)
but the goat thus called is not a satisfactory victim for sacrifice: (Mgh:) applied to a bull, it
means in like manner in his second year; (Mgh;)
or in his third year; and the bull thus called is
not a satisfactory victim for sacrifice: (TA:)
applied to a horse, it means in his third year;
(IAar;) or in his fourth year: (Mgh:) [but see
قَارِحٌ:] and applied to a camel, in his fifth year;
(Az, Mgh;) fem. with ة; and this (a جذعة) is
what must be given for the poor-rate when the
camels are more than sixty. (Az, TA.) [See also
شَصَرٌ.] ―
-b2-  A youth, or young man. (K.) ―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  One
who is light-witted, or weak and stupid, like a youth:
opposed in this sense to بَازِلٌ as meaning “ old: ”
(IAar, TA:) or one whose teeth have fallen out,
here and there, [as though likened to a beast thus
termed that has shed some of his first teeth,]
because he has drawn near to his appointed term
of life. (TA: [but it is not quite clear whether
this explanation relate to جذع or to بازل.]) ―
-b4-
(tropical:)  [A novice, or recent beginner.] You say, فُلَانٌ
فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ جَذَعٌ (tropical:)  [Such a one, in this affair,
is a novice, or recent beginner,] when he has
begun it recently. (S, Z.) ―
-b5-  الدَّهْرُ جَذَعٌ أَبَدًا
(tropical:)  Time, or fortune, is ever new, like a youth.
(K, * TA.) ―
-b6-  Hence, (TA,) الأَزْلَمُ الجَذَعُ (tropical:)  Time,
or fortune; (S, K;) as in the saying, أَهْلَكَهُمُ
الأَزْلَمُ الجَذَعُ (tropical:)  Time, or fortune, destroyed them;
and لَا آتِيكَ الأَزْلَمَ الجَذَعَ (tropical:)  I will not come to thee
ever. (TA.) [See also art. زلم.] And accord. to
some, (S,) The lion: (S, K:) but this is a mistake.
(IB, L.) ―
-b7-  And hence, (TA,) أُمُّ الجَذَعِ (tropical:)  Calamity, or misfortune. (K, TA.) ―
-b8-  أَعَدْتُ الأَمْرَ جَذَعًا
(tropical:)  I renewed the thing, or affair, as it was at the
first: as, for instance, a war which had been
extinguished. (TA.) And فَرَّ الأَمْرَ جَذَعًا [signifies,
in like manner, (tropical:)  He recommenced the thing: or]
he commenced the thing. (TA.) And فُرَّ الأَمْرُ
جَذَعًا (tropical:)  The thing was commenced: (TA:) or the

اجذع]. (TA.)
جَذْعَمَةٌ Young; (S, K, * TA;) not arrived at
puberty: (TA:) originally جَذْعَةٌ; (S, K;) the
م being augmentative: (S:) the ة is either to
give intensiveness to the meaning, or to denote
the fem. gender; the word being considered as
implying the meaning of نَفْسٌ or جُثَّةٌ. (TA.)
خَرُوفٌ مُتَجَاذِعٌ [A lamb approaching the age
in which the term جَذَعٌ is applied to him: expl.
in some copies of the K by دَانٍ: in others, by
وَانٍ:] in the copies of the O, expl. by وَانٍ مِنَ
الإِجْذَاعِ: in the TS and in the A, by دَانٍ, which
is probably the right reading. (TA.)
Quasi جذعم
جَذْعَمَةٌ: see art. جذع.
