lark,]
خَلَا لَكِ الجَوُّ فَبِيضِى وَاصْفِرِى
[The wide part of the valley has become vacant
for thee; so lay thine eggs, and whistle]. (AA,
S.) Az says, I entered, with an Arab of the
desert, a [hollow place in which water collected,
termed a] دَحْل, in El-Khalsà, and when we came
to the water, he said, هٰذَا جَوٌّ مِنَ المَاءِ لَا يُوقَفُ
عَلَى أَقْصَاهُ [This is an abyss of water: one knows
not the utmost extent of it]. (TA.) ―

↓ جَوَّةٌ, (TA,) and ↓ جَوَّانِىٌّ; (K; [in the CK
ا is erroneously put for ن;]) in

-b5-  [Hence,]
جَوَّةٌ I desire concealment, or secrecy,
and he desires publicity. (A in art. بر.)
جَوَّةٌ: see جَوٌّ, in two places.
جَوَّانِىٌّ: see جَوٌّ. Hence the saying of Selmán,
مَنْ أَصْلَحَ جَوَّانِيَّهُ أَصْلَحَ اللّٰهُ بَرَّانِيَّهُ [explained in
art. بر]. (TA.) [It generally signifies Inner,
inward, or interior; and secret, or private;
opposed to بَرَّانِىٌّ; and is now vulgarly pronounced جُوَّانِىْ.] It is a rel. n. [irregularly
formed] from جَوٌّ signifying “ any low, or depressed, part of the ground. ” (T in art. بر.)
