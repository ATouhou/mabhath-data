جنق1
جَنَقُوا, aor.
جَنِقَ, (IAar, K,) inf. n. جَنْقٌ;
(IAar, TA;) and ↓ جنّقوا, inf. n. تَجْنِيقٌ; (AZ,
K;) They cast stones of [or with] the مَنْجَنِيق:
(K, * TA:) and ↓ مَجْنَقُوا, (K,) or مَجْنَقُوا مَنْجَنِيقًا
[app. meaning they constructed a منجنيق], (Lth,
TA,) is said by such as hold the م to be radical;
(K;) or it may be that the م is augmentative,
and that the verb is [denominative,] similar to
تَمَسْكَنَ from مِسْكِينٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  جَنَقُونَا بِالمَنْجَنِيقِ
They cast at us with the منجنيق: mentioned by
El-Fárisee on the authority of AZ. (M.) An
Arab of the desert, in describing the wars of his
people, said, تَارَةً نُجْنَقْ وَأُخْرَى نُرْشَقْ [One time
we are cast at with the منجنيق, and another we
are shot at with arrows]: (S, * M:) also mentioned by El-Fárisee. (M.)

constructed the engines of the kind called منجنيق].
(JK.) See also 1.
Q. Q. 1
مَجْنَقُوا: see 1 and 2.
جُنُقٌ The stones of the منجنيق. (M, TA.)
[But] IAar says that جنق [app. جُنُقٌ] means The
people who manage the منجنيق. (TA.)
مُجَينِيقٌ dim. of مَنْجَنِيقٌ, q. v. (Sb, S.)
مَنْجَنُوقٌ: see what next follows.
مَنْجَنِيقٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and مِنْجَنِيقٌ (Msb, K)
and ↓ مَنْجَنُوقٌ (Lth, IAar, Msb, K) [A kind of
balista;] an instrument [or engine of war] with
which stones are cast (S, M, K, TA) at the enemy;
made by binding [in some manner] very tall
wooden poles, whereon is placed what is to be
cast, which is then struck with a long pole, and
so cast to a very distant place: [this imperfect
description (the only one that I have found of
this engine) seems to show that it was of a very
simple and rude construction:] it is an ancient
instrument, anterior to the invention [or use] of
gunpowder and cannons by the Christians; and
was used by Mohammad in the siege of Et-Táïf;
but the first [of the Arabs] who used it in the
time of paganism is said to have been Jedheemeh
El-Abrash, of the Mulook et-Tawáïf: (TA:) pl.
مَنْجَنِيقَاتٌ (S, Msb, K) and مَنْجَنُوقَاتٌ (Lth, TA)
and مَجَانِيقُ (Sb, S, Msb, K) and مَجَانِقُ: (K:)
dim. ↓ مُجَيْنِيقٌ: (Sb, S:) it is fem., (Lth, S, Msb,
K, *) preferably, (Lth, TA,) and in most instances;
(Msb;) and hence it is also called الأُنْثَى; (M in
art. انث;) but sometimes it is masc.: (Msb, K:)
and is arabicized, (S, Msb, K,) from the Persian
(S, K) مَنْ چِى نِيكْ, i. e. “ How excellent am I! ”
(S,) or مَنْ چِهْ نِيكْ, i. e. “ I, how excellent am
I! ” (K;) [Golius asserts it to be from the Greek
μάγγανον but this is the original of مَنْجَنُونٌ,
which has a different meaning: its derivation,
however, seems to have been unknown to the
Arabs in general; for] some say that مَنْجَنِيقٌ is of
the measure مَفْعَلِيلٌ, [so in copies of the S, but
correctly مَنْفَعِيلٌ, as in the Msb and TA,] because
of the phrase نُجْنَقُ مَرَّةً [see 1]: (S, Msb: *) or,
(Msb,) accord. to Sb, (S,) it is of the measure
فَنْعَلِيلٌ; (S, Msb;) because مَجَانِيقُ is its pl. and
the dim. is مُجَينِيقٌ; and because, if the م were
augmentative as well as the ن, there would be
two augmentative letters at the beginning of the
noun, and this may not be in substs. nor in epithets
that are not conformable to augmented verbs;
and if the ن were made an essential part of the
word, the noun would be a quadriliteral-radical,
and augmentative letters are not prefixed to words
of this class except nouns conformable to their
verbs, like مُدَحْرَجٌ: (S, TA:) but MF says that
these disquisitions are unprofitable; for in his
opinion, all the letters of the word are radical,
since it is a foreign word. (TA.)
مَنْجَنِيِقىٌّ [app. A maker of the kind of engine
called منجنيق; being mentioned as a surname:]
a rel. n. from منجنيق. (K.)
