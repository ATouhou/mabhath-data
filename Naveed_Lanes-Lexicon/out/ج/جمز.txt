جَمَزَ, (S, A, &c.,) aor.
جَمِزَ, inf. n. جَمْزٌ (S,
Msb, K) and جَمَزَى, (K,) or the latter is a
simple subst., (Msb,) said of a camel, (S, K,)
and of a man, (A, K,) [He went at a gentle trot
or run;] he went a pace quicker than that termed
عَنَقٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) but not so quick as that
termed حُضْرٌ, (K,) or not so quick as a vehement
حُضْر; (TA;) he went the pace with which corpses
are conveyed [to the tomb; which, according to
the practice prescribed by Mohammad, is a quick
pace]: (TA:) or simply, he went, or went along:
(Msb:) and he ran; syn. عَدَا: (Mgh, Msb:)
and he went quickly. (Mgh, Msb, TA.) You
say, جَمَزَ بِالْجِنَازَةِ He went a pace quicker than
that termed عَنَقٌ [with the corpse upon its bier].
(A.) And جَمَزَ الرَّجُلُ فِى الأَرْضَ The man went

جَمَزَى a subst. from جَمَزَ; [signifying A gentle
trot or run; a pace quicker than that termed
عَنَقٌ, but not so quick as that termed حُضْرٌ,
or not so quick as a vehement حُضْر; &c.]
(Msb.) You say, هُوَ يَعْدُو الجَمَزَى, (A,) and
النَّاقَةُ تَعْدُو الجَمَزَى, and in like manner الفَرَسُ,
(Ks, S,) [He, and the she-camel, and the mare
or horse, runs at the pace termed جَمَزَى.] ―
-b2-
See also جَمَّازٌ, in two places.
جَمَّازٌ, applied to a he-camel, (S, K,) and جَمَّازَةٌ,
applied to a she-camel, (K,) That is ridden by
the مُجَمِّز; (S;) that goes the pace described
above, [voce جَمَزَى and] voce جَمَزَ: (K, TA:)
[the latter is also said in the TA to be من آلَات
المحامل; but the correct reading seems to be
مِنْ أُولَات المَحَامِلِ; and the meaning, of those
that carry the vehicles called محامل, pl. of
مَحْمِل.] ―
-b2-  حِمَارٌ جَمَّازٌ An ass that leaps, jumps,
springs, or bounds, quickly: (K:) and حِمَارٌ
↓ جَمَزَى a quick ass; (S, K;) or an ass that
leaps, jumps, springs, or bounds, quickly, and is
swift; (TA;) the latter word in this phrase used
as a masc. and fem. epithet, though its final letter
is a denotative of the fem. gender. (Ham p. 277.
[See below; and see also حَيَدَى.]) Umeiyeh
Ibn-Abee-'Áïdh (S, TA) El-Hudhalee (TA) says,
كَأَنِّى وَرَحْلِى إِذَا رُعْتُهَا
جَازِئٍ بِالرِّمَالِ ↓ عَلَى جَمَزَى
[As though I and my she-camel's saddle, when I
frightened her, were upon a swift wild ass satisfied with green pasture, so as to be in no need of
water, in the sands]. (S, TA.) He likens his
she-camel to a wild ass, to which he applies the
epithet جمزى, that is, swift; meaning, عَلَى حِمَارٍ
جَمَزَى. (TA.) As says that this is the only
epithet of the measure فَعَلَى heard by him applied
to a male; and that IAar cited the verse above
to him saying حَيِّدٍ بِالدِّحَالِ, meaning عَنِ الدِّحَالِ,
[i. e., “shying and turning aside from the hollows,
narrow at the top but wide below, in the ground: ”
but this is probably a reading of some in the place
of حَيَدَى بِالدِّحَالِ, which ends the next verse,
agreeably with what is said in the L in art. حيد:]
Az says that عَلَى جَمَزَى may be explained as for
عَلَى عَيْرٍ ذِى جَمَزَى, i. e., upon an ass having the
mode of pace termed جَمَزَى; and نَاقَةٌ وَكَرَى has
a similar meaning. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See also مُجَمِّزٌ.
جُمَّيْزٌ (S, K) and ↓ جُمَّيْزَى (K) [The sycamorefig: and the sycamore fig-tree: ficus sycomorus;
also called the Egyptian fig:] the male fig; (K,
TA;) which is found in the Ghowr, or Ghór,
[here meaning the Valley of the Jordan,] (TA,)

various colours, or kinds, (أَلْوَان,) (K, * TA;)
abundant in Syria and in Egypt: n. un. جُمَّيْزَةٌ:
(TA:) [a fruit] resembling the تِين [or common
fig]: (S:) AHn says, of the kinds of fig is the
fig of the جُمَّيْز, a sweet, moist fig, which has long
fruit-stalks, and which is dried in the sun: and
there is another species of the جمّيز, the fruit of
which is like the fig in make, but its leaves are
smaller than those of the fig, and its figs are
yellow, of a small size, and black: it is found in
the Ghowr, or Ghór, and is called the male fig:
the yellow is sweet: the black makes the mouth
bleed: and its fig has no stalk, but cleaves to the
wood. ('Abd-el-Lateef, Account of Egypt: White's
ed., entitled Abdollatiphi Historiæ Aegypti Compendium: p. 22. See also De Sacy's notes to his
transl. of that work, pp. 82—86.) ―
