جرم1
جَرَمَهُ, aor.
جَرِمَ, (K,) inf. n. جَرْمٌ, (S,) [like
جَزَمَهُ,] He cut it, or cut it off. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  جَرَمَ
الشَّاةَ, (K,) or جَرَمَ صُوفَ الشَّاةِ, (S,) inf. n. as
above, (TA,) He shore, or sheared, or cut off the
wool of, the sheep. (S, K, * TA.) And جَرَمْتُ مِنْهُ
I took [or clipped somewhat] from it; [namely,
the wool;] like جَلَمْتُ. (S.) ―
-b3-  جَرَمَ النَّخْلَ, (S,
Msb, K,) aor. as above, (TA,) inf. n. جَرْمٌ (K)
and جَرَامٌ and جِرَامٌ, (S, * K,) He cut the palmtrees; (Msb;) [meaning] he cut off the fruit of
the palm-trees; (S, K;) as also ↓ اجترمهُ: (S:)
and in like manner, جَرَمَ التَّمْرَ he cut off the
dates. (TA.) You say, هٰذَا زَمَنُ الجَرَامِ and
الجِرَامِ, (S,) i. e. [This is] the time of the cutting
off of the fruit of the palm-trees. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And
جَرَمَ النَّخْلَ, inf. n. جَرْمٌ, He computed by conjecture the quantity of fruit upon the palm-trees;
(K;) and so ↓ اجترمهُ: (Lh, K:) [like جَزَمَهُ and
اجتزمهُ.]
-A2-  جَرَمَ, (S, K,) aor.
جَرِمَ, (S,) inf. n. جَرْمٌ,
(TK,) also signifies He gained, acquired, or
earned, [wealth, &c.,] (S, K,) لِأَهْلِهِ for his
family; and so ↓ اجترم. (K.) And you say,
خَرَجَ يَجْرِمُ لِأَهْلِهِ and يَجْرِمُ أَهْلَهُ, meaning He
went forth seeking [sustenance], and practising
skill, or artifice, for his family. (TA.) ―
-b2-  وَلَا
يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ, in the Kur [v. 3 and 11], is
explained by some as meaning And let not a
people's hatred by any means occasion you. or
cause you: or it means let not a people's hatred
by any means induce you, or incite you. (S, TA.)
Some read ↓ لا يُجْرِمَنَّكُمْ, with damm to the ى;
and Zj says that جَرَمْتُ and أَجْرَمْتُ signify the
same: but some say that the meaning is, let it
not by any means lead you into crime, or sin;
أَجْرَمْتُهُ being like آثَمْتُهُ, I led him into sin, &c.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  Fr says that the asserting جَرَمْتُ to
mean حَقَقْتُ [or rather حُقِقْتُ, for this is evidently, I think, the right reading, though I find
حَقَقْتُ in the TA as well as in a copy of the S, in
another copy of which I find جَرَمَتْ and حَقَّقَتْ,
suggesting that the right reading may perhaps be
جَرَمَتْ and حُقَّتْ,] is nought: they who so explain
it having been confused in their judgment by the
saying of the poet Aboo-Asmà, (S, TA,) or, as
some say, El-Howfazán, (TA,) or, accord. to
some, 'Ateeyeh Ibn-'Ofeyf, (IB, TA,)
وَلَقَدْ طَعَنْتُ أَبَا عُيَيْنَةَ طَعْنَةً
جَرَمَتْ فَزَارَةَ بَعْدَهَا أَنْ يَغْضَبُوا
in which they made فزارة to be in the nom. case,
as though the meaning were حُقَّ لَهَا الغَضَبُ [it
was right, or fit, or proper, for it, (the tribe of
Fezárah,) to be angry; nearly agreeing with an
explanation of جَرَمَ given by Golius as on the
authority of Ibn-Maaroof, namely, “meritus, dignus fuit ”]: but, he says, فزارة is in the accus.
case; the meaning being, جَرَمَتْهُمُ الطَّعْنَةُ أَنْ يَغْضَبُوا
[which will be found explained, on the authority
of IB, in what follows]: AO says that the meaning is, أَحَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الغَضَبَ, i. e., أَحَقَّتِ الطَّعْنَةُ
فَزَارَةَ أَنْ يَغْضَبُوا, and حَقَّت also, [both having the
same signification, i. e., the thrust required Fezá-
rah to be angry,] from لَا جَرَمَ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ كَذَا meaning حَقًّا [Verily I will do thus]: (S, TA:) accord.
to Fr, the meaning is, كَسَبَتْ فَزَارَةَ الغَضَبَ عَلَيْكَ,
the right reading being, وَلَقَدْ طَعَنْتَ, with fet-h
to the ت; [so that the verse means And verily
thou didst thrust Aboo-'Oyeyneh with a thrust of
thy spear that occasioned, or caused, Fezárah,
after it, to be angry against thee:] for he is addressing Kurz El-'Okeylee, bewailing his death;
and Kurz had thrust Aboo-'Oyeyneh, who was
Hisn Ibn-Hudheyfeh Ibn-Bedr El-Fezáree. (IB,
TA.) ―
-b4-  And جَرَمَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.
جَرِمَ, inf. n.
جَرْمٌ, (Msb,) He committed a sin, a crime, a
fault, an offence, or an act of disobedience; (S,
Msb, K;) syn. أَذْنَبَ, (Msb, K,) and اِكْتَسَبَ الإِثْمَ;
(Msb;) [perhaps because he who does so brings
upon himself the consequence thereof; as though
originally جَرَمَ نَفْسَهُ اولِنَفْسِهِ أَثَرَ جُرْمٍ he drew
upon himself the effect of a sin, &c.; (compare
كَسَبَ and اِكْتَسَبَ;)] as also ↓ اجرم, (S, Msb,
K,) inf. n. إِجْرَامٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ اجترم; (S, K;)
and ↓ تجرّم. (El-'Okberee, Har p. 207.) You
say, جَرَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ جَرِيمَةً, and إِلَيْهِمْ, (K,) and بِهِمْ,
used by a poet for عليهم or اليهم, (IAar, TA,) He
committed against them a crime, or an offence
for which he should be punished; as also ↓ اجزم.
(K.) They said also, الذَّنْبَ ↓ اجرم [He committed the sin, or crime, amp;c.]; making the verb
trans. (TA.) And a poet says,
وَتَرَى اللَّبِيبَ مُحَسَّدًا لَمْ يَجْتَرِمْ
عِرْضَ الرِّجَالِ وَعِرْضُهُ مَشْتُومٌ
[And thou seest the intelligent envied, or much
envied: he has not injured the honour of men,
while his honour is reviled]. (Th, TA.)
-A3-  جَرِمَ,
aor.
جَرَمَ, (K,) inf. n. جَرَمٌ, (TK,) He (a man, TA)
betook himself to eating the جُرَامَة [in the CK,
erroneously, جَرامَة,] of the palm-trees, (AA, K,)
[i. e., the dates which had fallen in the cutting,
and] which were among the branches. (AA, TA.)
-A4-  جَرِمَ, said of a man, also signifies عَظُمَ جُرْمُهُ
[His sin, or crime, &c., was, or became, great];
and so جَرُمَ, like كَرُم: [both are thus explained,
in different places in this art, by the author of
the TA; and the explanation in the latter case is
followed by اى اذنب, i. e., he committed a six,
&c.; probably added by him to show that the
reading found by him was جُرْمُهُ, not جِرْمُهُ: but
[think that the right reading is عَظُمَ جِرْمُهُ his
body became great; and this is confirmed by what
here follows:] ↓ اجرم explained in the copies of
the K by عَظُمَ [in the TK عظم يعنى جرمه وجسده]
should be جَرِمَ, a triliteral; and the meaning is
عَظُمَ جُرْمُهُ: and in like manner, the three significations here following, assigned in the K to ↓ اجرم,
belong to جَرِمَ. (TA.)
-A5-  It (his colour) was, or
became, clear. (K, * TA.) ―
-b2-  He (a man, TA)
was, or became, clear in his voice. (K, * TA.)
-A6-
جَرِمَ بِهِ It (blood) stuck to him, or it: (K, * TA,
and so in a marginal note in a copy of the S:)
and in like manner, tar to a camel. (The same
marginal note.)
2
جَرَّمَ [جرّم He cut off vehemently, or much.
(Golius, on the authority of a gloss in the KL.)]
―
-b2-  جَرَّمْنَا هُمْ, inf. n. تَجْرِيمٌ, We went forth from
them. (Lth, K.) ―
-b3-  جَرَّمْنَا الشِّتَآءَ We completed
the winter. (TA.) [See also 5.]
4
اجرم التَّمْرُ The dates attained to the time
for their being cut off. (TA.)
-A2-  See also 1, in
six places.
5
تجرّم [It became cut off. ―
-b2-  And hence,]
(tropical:)  It (a year, حَوْلٌ) became completed; (Az, K,
TA;) as though it became cut off from the preceding year: (Az, TA:) it ended; (S;) and so
the winter: (TA:) and it (a night) passed away,
(S, K,) and became completed; (K;) it ended.
(TA.)
-A2-  تجرّم ثَمَانِيًا, a phrase used by Sá'ideh
Ibn-Ju-eiyeh, means He passed eight nights.
(TA.) [See also 2]
-A3-  تجرّم عَلَيْهِ He accused
him of a sin, a crime, a fault, an offence, or an
act of disobedience, (Abu-l-'Abbás, S, K,) which
he had not committed, (Abu-l-'Abbás, S,) or
though he had not committed any (K.) ―
-b2-  And
تجرّم He guarded against the commission of sin,
or crime, &c; like تأثّم. (Har p. 207.) ―
-b3-  See
also 1.
-A4-  Also He called, cried out, shouted, or
vociferated; from جِرْمٌ meaning صَوْتٌ. (Har
p. 207. [But see جِرْمٌ.])
8
إِجْتَرَمَ see 1, in five places.
جَرْمٌ Hot; syn. حَرٌّ, (S,) or [rather] حَارٌّ; (K;)
contr. of صَرْدٌ; (Lth, TA;) a Persian word, (S,)
arabicized; (S, K;) originally گَرْم. (TA.) You
say أَرْضٌ جَرْمٌ A warm land: (AHn, TA:) or a
hot land: (IDrd, TA:) or a vehemently hot
land: (K:) pl. جُرُومٌ, (AHn, TA,) which, applied to countries, or regions, means the contr. of
صُرُودٌ. (S.)
-A2-  A boat (زَوْرَقٌ) of El-Yemen;
(K;) also called نَقِيرَةٌ: (TA:) pl. as above. (K.)
[In the dial. of Egypt, The largest kind of Egyptian boat used on the Nile for the conveyance of
grain and merchandise in general, but used only
when the river is high, and also in the coastingtrade, and generally carrying from 5,000 to
15,000 bushels of grain.]
جُرْمٌ A sin, a crime, a fault, an offence, or an
act of disobedience, syn. ذَنْبٌ, (S, Msb, * K,)
whether intentional or committed through inadvertence; (Kull voce إِثْمٌ;) as also ↓ جَرِيمَةٌ; (S,
Msb, K;) and ↓ جَرِمَةٌ: (K:) transgression:
(TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَجْرَامٌ and [of mult.] جُرُومٌ,
(K,) both of جُرْمٌ: the pl. of جَرِيَمةٌ is جَرَائِمُ.
(TA.)
-A2-  See also جَرَامٌ.
-A3-  لَا جُرْمَ: see لَا جَرَمَ.
جِرْمٌ The body; syn. جَسَدٌ; (S, Msb, K;) or
بَدَنٌ; (Th, TA;) as also ↓ جِرْمَانٌ: (K:) or the
أَلْوَاحِ [pl. of لَوْح q. v.] and جُثْمَان [q. v.] of the
جَسَد: (T, TA:) pl. (of pauc., TA) أجْرَامٌ, (Msb,
K,) which is also used as a sing., (TA,) and (of
mult., TA) جُرُومٌ and جُرُمٌ. (K.) أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ أَجْرَامَهُ
is a phrase mentioned, but not explained, by Lh:
ISd thinks that it means He threw upon him the
weight of his body; as though the term جِرْمٌ
applied to each separate part of his body. (TA.)
―
-b2-  [Hence,] الأَجْرَامُ الفَلَكِيَّةُ The [heavenly] bodies
that are above the عَنَاصِر, of the orbs and stars.
(KT.)
-A2-  The throat, or fauces; syn. حَلْقٌ. (K.)
The phrase يَضِيقُ بِهِ الجِرْمُ, used by the poet
Maan Ibn-'Ows, means (assumed tropical:)  It is a great, or formidable, thing, or matter: [properly,] the throat
(الحَلْقُ) will not easily swallow it. (TA.) ―
-b2-  The
voice; (S, K;) mentioned by ISk and others;
(S;) and so explained as used in the phrase
إِنَّ فُلَانًا لَحَسَنُ الجِرْمِ [Verily such a one is good
in respect of voice]: (TA:) or highness, or loudness, of the voice: (K, TA:) you say, مَا عَرَفْتُهُ إِلَّا
بِجِرْمِهِ [I knew him not save by his voice, or his
highness, or loudness, of voice]: but some disapprove this: (TA:) AHát says that the vulgar are
addicted to saying, فُلَانٌ صَافِى الجِرْمِ Such a one
is clear in voice, or in throat: but it is a mistake.
(S, TA.)
-A3-  Colour. (IAar, S, Msb, K.) One
may say, of نَجَاسَة [or filth], لَا جِرْمَ لَهَا, meaning
It has no colour. (Msb.)
-A4-  الأَجْرَامُ (app. as pl.
of جِرْمٌ, TA) The utensils, or apparatus, of the
pastor. (K.)
لَا جَرَمَ (S, Msb, K, &c.) and لَا ذَا جَرَمَ, (IAar,
K,) ذا being here a redundant connective as in
several other instances, (IAar, TA,) and لَا أَنْ ذَا
جَرَمَ and لَا عَنْ ذَا جَرَمَ (K) and لَا جَرَ, (Ks, K,
[in the CK لا جَرْمَ,]) in which the م is elided in
consequence of frequency of usage, as the ى is in
حَاشَ لِلّهِ for حَاشَى لِلّٰهِ, and the ى and ء in أَيْشَ
for أَىُّ شَىْءٍ, (Ks, TA,) and لَا ذَا جَرَ (IAar, TA)
and ↓ لَا جَرُمَ and ↓ لَا جُرْمَ, (K,) originally i. q.
لَا بُدَّ and لَامَحَالَةٌ [There is no avoiding it; it is
absolutely necessary; &c.]: then, by reason of
frequency of usage, employed in the manner of
an oath, as meaning حَقًّا [verily, or truly];
wherefore, as in the case of an oath, ل is prefixed
to its complement, (Fr, S, Msb, K, *) so that they
say, لَا جَرَمَ لَآتِيَنّكَ [Verily I will come to thee],
(Fr, S, K,) and لَا جَرَمَ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ كَذَا [Verily I
will do thus], (S, Msb, *) and لَا جَرَمَ لَقَدْ كَانَ كَذَا
and لَا ذَا جَرَمَ and لَا ذَا جَرَ [Verily it was thus,
or verily such a thing happened]: (IAar, TA:)
ISd says, Kh asserts that جَرَمَ [or لَا جَرَمَ] is
only a reply to something said before it; as when
a man says, “They did such a thing,” and you
say, لَا جَرَمَ أَنَّهُمْ سَيَنْدَمُونَ, or أَنَّهُ سَيَكُونُ كَذَا
وَكَذَا; and Az says that لا in لَا جَرَمَ is said to be
a [mere] connective; and the meaning [of the
former of the last two phrases] is كَسَبَ لَهُمْ
عَمَلُهُمُ النَّدَمَ [It (their deed) will earn for them,
or occasion them, repentance; and that of the
latter, it will occasion that such and such things
shall happen]: and some say that جَرَمَ means
وَجَبَ, and حَقَّ, and that لا is a contradiction to
the words preceding it, and that a new proposition
then begins; as in the Kur [xvi. 64] where it is
said, لَا جَرَمَ أَنَّ لَهُمُ النَّارَ, i. e., [Nay, or] the case
is not as they have said: the fire [of Hell] is
their due. (TA.)
لَا جَرُمَ: see the paragraph next preceding.
جِرْمَةٌ People cutting off the fruit of palmtrees. (S, K, TA.) [In this sense it is app. a pl.
of pauc., or a quasi-pl. n., of جَارِمٌ, q. v.] ―
-b2-  Also
Ripening dates cut off from the trees: and this
sense, not the former as is implied in the S, is
meant by Imra-el-Keys, where he says,
عَلَوْنَ بِأَنْطَاكِيَّةٍ فَوْقَ عِقْمَةٍ
كَجِرْمَةٍ نَخْلٍ أَوْ كَجَنَّةِ يَثْرِبَ
[They mounted, at Antioch, upon a variegated
cloth, like the ripening dates cut off from palmtrees, or like the garden of Yethrib]: he likens
the variegated cloth and wool upon the هَوْدَج to
red and yellow ripening dates, or to the garden
of Yethrib because it abounded with palm-trees.
(TA.)

جَرَامٌ (erroneously said in the K to be [جُرَامٌ]

of the measures فَعَالٌ and فَعِيلٌ, like شَحَاحٌ and
شَحِيحٌ, and بَجَالٌ and بَجِيلٌ, &c. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also,
both these words, (AA, S, K, *) but the former
not heard in this sense by ISd, (TA,) Datestones; (AA, S, K;) and so ↓ جُرْمٌ: (mentioned
in one copy of the S, but not in the TA, [probably an interpolation in the copy of the S above
mentioned:]) and ↓ جَرِيمَةٌ a date-stone; as in
the saying of 'Ows Ibn-Háritheh, لَا وَالَّذِى أَخْرَجَ
العَذْقَ مِنَ الجَرِيمَةِ وَالنَّارَ مِنَ الوَثِيمَةِ [No, by
Him who has produced the palm-tree with its
fruit from the date-stone, and fire from broken
stones]. (TA.)

TA;) as also ↓ مَجْرُومٌ. (TA.) And شَجَرَةٌ جَرِيمَةٌ

-b2-  See also جَرَامٌ, with which
it is syn. in two senses: in the latter sense having
جَرِيمَةٌ for its n un. ―
-b3-  Also A thing with which
date-stones are brayed, or crushed. (TA.)
-A2-  See
also مُجْرِمٌ.
-A3-  Also Large-bodied; (S, * K;) and
so ↓ مَجْرُومٌ: (K:) pl. (of the former, S) جِرَامٌ.
(S, K.) The fem. of the former is with ة: (K:)
[but] one says also جِلَّةٌ جَرِيمٌ, meaning Largebodied camels advanced in age. (S.)
-A4-  In El-
Hijáz, The [measure commonly termed] مُدّ is
thus called; accord. to Z, the مُدّ of the Prophet.
(TA.)
جُرَامَةٌ i. q. جُذَامَةٌ; (K;) i. e., (TA,) The
dates that have fallen when they are cut off from
the tree: (S, TA:) so says As: (TA:) [but
see the latter word as explained on the authority
of the S in art. جذم:] and, (K,) or as some say,
(TA,) dates cut off from the tree: or what are
gotten (يُجْرَمُ) thereof, after their being cut off,
being picked up from the lower ends of the branches.
(K, TA. [See جَرِمَ.]) And The قَصَل of wheat and
barley; i. e., the extremities thereof, which are
bruised, and then cleared, or picked: (K, TA:)
