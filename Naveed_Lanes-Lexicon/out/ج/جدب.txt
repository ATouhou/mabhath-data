(tropical:) We alighted as guests at the abode of the sons

as guests at the abode of such a one, and [found
that] he did not entertain us. (TA.) [The latter,

disagreeable, or unsuitable, to accompany thee;
syn. مَا أَسْتَوْخِمُ. (K.)
جَدْبٌ Drought, barrenness, or dearth; contr.

drought, or suspension of rain, and dryness of the
earth; (Msb;) dryness and barrenness of the
earth: (Har p. 576:) and ↓ جِدَبٌّ is a name,
or subst., for الجَدْبٌ, (K, TA,) meaning المَحْلُ;
as in the saying of the rájiz, cited by Sb,
لَقَدْ خَشِيتُ أَنْ أَرَى جِدَبَّا
فِى عَامِنَا بَعْدَ مَا أَخْصَبَّا
[Verily I feared to see drought, or barrenness,
&c., in this our year, after it had been abundant
in herbage]; جِدَبَّا being used for الجَدْبَا; or,
accord. to one reading, it is ↓ جَدْبَبَّا, with a
doubled ب added; the change being made for
the sake of the metre. (M, TA. [Respecting
أَخْصَبَّا, see 4 in art. خصب.]) ―
-b2-  Also A place,
(S, A, K,) or a country, or region, (Msb,) affected
with drought, barrenness, or dearth; or with
drought, and dryness of the earth; and so
↓ جَدِيبٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ جَدُوبٌ and
↓ مَجْدُوبٌ, (K,) the last derived from جُدِبَ
though this verb has not been used, (TA,) and
↓ مُجْدِبٌ, (M, A,) of which the pl. is مَجَادِيبُ.
(A.) You say also أَرْضٌ جَدْبٌ [in which جدب
is an inf. n. (though app. obsolete as such) and
therefore applicable to a fem. subst.] (ISd, TA)
and جَدْبَةٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ جَدِبَةٌ (A, Msb)
and ↓ جَدِيبٌ (Msb) and ↓ جَدُوبٌ (Lh, M, Msb)
and ↓ مُجْدِبَةٌ, of which last the pl. is مَجَادِيبُ,
(Msb,) A land affected with drought, &c.: (S,
M, A, &c.:) and أَرْضُونَ جُدُوبٌ, (S, K,) as though
to each part were applied the term جَدْبٌ [used
as a subst.] from which is formed the pl. جُدُوبٌ,
(TA,) and جَدْبٌ, (K,) which is here an inf. n.
used as an epithet [and therefore applicable to a
pl. subst.], (TA,) lands affected with drought,
&c. (S, K.) And ↓ فَلَاةٌ جَدْبَآءُ [fem. of أَجْدَبُ]
(M, K) A desert affected with drought, &c.;
(K;) in which is neither little nor much, neither
pasture nor herbage. (M, TA.) And ↓ فُلَانٌ جَدِيبُ

with drought, &c. (S. [But this phrase is generally used tropically, as meaning (assumed tropical:) Such a one is
ungenerous or illiberal or inhospitable. See art.
جنب.]) And سَنَةٌ جَدْبَةٌ (K in art. جرز) and عَامٌ

also أَجَادِبُ, in two places.
-A2-  Also i. q. عَيْبٌ [A
vice, fault, defect, &c.]; (S, A, K;) a signification which may be either proper or tropical.
(Er-Rághib, MF.)
أَرْضٌ جَدِبَةٌ: see جَدْبٌ.
أَخَذَ فِى وَادِى جَدَبَاتٍ: see جَذَبَات, in art.
جذب.
جِدَبٌّ and جَدْبَبٌّ: see جَدْبٌ.
جَدُوبٌ: see جَدْبٌ, in three places.
جَدِيبٌ: see جَدْبٌ, in three places.
جَادِبٌ Finding fault, dispraising, expressing
disapprobation: whence the saying of Dhu-rRummeh,
فَيَا لَكَ مِنْ خَدٍّ أَسِيلٍ و مَنْطِقٍ
رَخِيمٍ وَمِنْ خَلْقٍ تَعَلَّلَ جَادِبُهْ
meaning [O thou smooth and even cheek, and
gentle speech, and make] whereof he who dispraises it occupies himself vainly, finding no
defect in it. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  It is also said [as in
the K &c.] to signify Lying; and the author of
the 'Eyn says that it has no verb belonging to it
[in this sense]; but this is a mistranscription
[for خَادِبٌ]: AZ says that جَادِبٌ, with ج, has
the signification here first given. (M, TA.)
جُنْدَبٌ and جُنْدُبٌ (S, K, &c.) and جِنْدَبٌ,
like دِرْهَمٌ, (Sb, M, K,) the last of which is of
weakest authority, because of a rare measure,
whereof it has been said that there are only four
examples: (TA:) in all of them the ن is said
by some to be radical; but others, with more
reason, hold it to be augmentative: (MF:) Sb
says that it is augmentative: (S:) A species of
locust, (S, K,) well known: (K:) or the male
locust: or small locust: or, accord. to Seer, i. q.
صَدًى [a kind of cricket], that creaks by night,
and hops and flies: [but see صَدًى:] or, accord.
to the M, it is smaller than the صدى, and is
found in the deserts: pl. جَنَادِبُ. (TA.) صرّ
الجندب [i. e. صَرَّ الجُنْدَبُ The جندب creaked]
is a saying of the Arabs, used as a proverb;
alluding to a difficult affair by which a person
is troubled in mind; originating from the fact
that the جندب, when its feet are scorched by the
heated ground, does not keep them steadily upon
it, and a creaking sound is consequently heard,
produced by its legs. (TA.) ―
-b2-  أُمُّ جُنْدَبٍ The
sand; because the locust [or جندب] deposits
its eggs therein: and the walker therein falls into
evil [or encounters difficulty]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence
it signifies also] Misfortune: (S, M, K:) and
perfidy, or faithlessness, or treachery: (M, K:)
and wrong, or injury: (S, M, K:) and evil conduct,
or ill treatment. (S.) You say, وَقَعَ فُلَانٌ فِى
أُمِّ جُنْدَبٍ Such a one fell into misfortune: or
into perfidy. (TA.) And وَقَعُوا فِى أُمِّ جُنْدَبٍ
They suffered wrong, or injury. (AZ, S, K.)
And وَقَعَ القَوْمُ جُنْدَبٍ The people, or company
of men, committed wrong, or injury, and slew
him who was not a slayer: (TA:) [as though
they came with violence upon sand in which eggs
of the جندب were deposited, and so destroyed
the eggs, which had occasioned them no harm.]
And رَكِبَ أُمَّ جُنْدَبٍ He committed wrong, or
injury. (TA.)
[
أَجْدَبُ i. q. جَدْبٌ as syn. with جَدِيبٌ: fem.
جَدْيَآءُ. Hence,] فَلَاةٌ جَدْيَآءُ: see جَدْبٌ. ―
-b2-  [Hence
also,] سَنَةٌ جَدْبَآءُ A year of much snow. (L in
art. شهب.) ―
-b3-  أَجْدَبُ is [also] said in the M to
be [used as] a subst. applied to what is termed
مُجْدِب [i. e. as syn. with the latter word used
as an epithet in which the quality of a subst.
is predominant; app. meaning A place, or the
like, affected with drought, &c.]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  [Also,
as a comparative and superlative epithet, meaning
More, and most, affected with drought, &c.;
contr. of أَخْصَبُ.]
أَجَادِبُ, in a trad., where it is said, وَكَانَتْ فِيهِ
أَجَادِبُ أَمْسَكَتِ المَآءِ, (K, * TA,) or وكانت فِيهَا,
(TA,) [And there were in it اجادب that retained the water], is said to be pl. of أَجْدُبٌ,
which is pl. of ↓ جَدْبٌ, (K, TA,) like as أَكَالِبُ
is pl. of أَكْلُبٌ, which is pl. of كَلْبٌ; (TA;)
and signifies hard parts of the ground, that
retain water, and do not imbibe it quickly; or,
as some say, land having no plants or herbage,
from ↓ جَدْبٌ meaning “ drought ” &c: the word
is thus written in the two Saheehs, of El-Bukháree and Muslim: (IAth, TA:) but some say
that it is an anomalous pl. of جَدْبٌ, like as مَحَاسِنُ
is of حُسْنٌ: and there are other readings; namely,
أَجَاذِبُ and أَحَادِبُ and أَحَازِبُ and أَجَارِدُ, pl. of
أَجْرَدُ, and إِخَاذَاتٌ, pl. of إِخَاذَةٌ. (MF, TA.)
مُجْدِبٌ, and its fem., with ة: see جَدْبٌ.
مِجْدَابٌ Land scarely ever, or never, abundant in
herbage, or in the goods, conveniences, or comforts,
of life; scarcely ever, or never, fruitful, or plentiful. (K.)
مَجْدُوبٌ: see جَدْبٌ.
