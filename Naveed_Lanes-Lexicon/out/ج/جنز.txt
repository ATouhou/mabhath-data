جِنَازَةٌ and جَنَازَةٌ signify the same, (Mgh, Msb,
K,) namely, A dead person; a corpse: (K:)
but the former is the more chaste: (Msb:) or
the former signifies the dead person; and the
latter, the bier: (As, IAar, Msb, K:) or the
former, the bier; and the latter, the dead person:
(Mgh, Msb, K:) so accord. to Th, as related by
Aboo-'Amr Ez-Záhid: (Msb:) or the former is
said by the vulgar to mean the bier: (As, TA:)

person: (K:) or the dead person upon the bier:
(S:) and the bier is not so called unless the dead
person is upon it: (AAF:) when the dead person
is not upon it, it is called سَرِيرٌ and نَعْشٌ: (AAF,
S:) but the vulgar say جَنَازَةٌ, with fet-h; (S;)
which is not allowable: (Lth, As, Mgh, TA:)
or جَنَازَةٌ [so in the TA] signifies the man: or the
bier with the man: (En-Nadr, TA:) جنازة is
derived from جَنَزَهُ, in the first of the senses
assigned to it above: (A, Msb, TA:) so some
assert: (IDrd, TA:) but ISd says, I know not
whether this be correct: (TA:) or a جَنَازَة is so
called because the clothes are gathered together
when the man is upon the bier: ('Abd-Allah
Ibn-El-Hasan, TA:) some say that it is Nabathean: (TA:) the pl. is جَنَائِزُ. (S.) The Arabs
say, تَرَكْتُهُ جِنَازَةً I left him a corpse, or dead.
(As, TA.) And ضُرِبَ الرَّجُلُ حَتَّى تُرِكَ جَنَازَةً [so
in the TA, The man was beaten until he was left
a corpse]. (ISh, TA.) And رُمِىَ فِى جِنَازَتِهِ,
meaning, He died: (Lth, Mgh:) or he has been
carried, or lifted, and put [into his bier]: this
they say when they give information of the death
of a man: (TA:) and they say also, طُعِنَ فِى
جِنَازَتِهِ, meaning the same. (Lth, Mgh, TA.) ―

Ki'ás, says,
وَكُنْتُ إِذَا أَرَى زِقًّا صَرِيعًا
يُنَاحُ عَلَى جَنَازَتِهِ بَكَيْتُ
[And I used, when I saw a wine-skin laid prostrate, its corpse being wailed over, to weep, or
accord. to Th, as is said in the TA in art. بكى,
to sing]. (TA.) ―
