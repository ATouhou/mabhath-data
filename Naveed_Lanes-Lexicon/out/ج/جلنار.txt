جلنارجُلَّنَارٌ The flower of the pomegranate: an arabicized word, from گُلْنَارْ, (K,) which is Persian,
composed of گُلْ “ a flower,” and نَارْ “ a pomegranate. ” (MF.) It is said that whoever swallows
three grains of it, of the smallest that may be,
(K,) on the condition of his taking them with his
mouth from the tree, before their opening, at
sunrise, on a Wednesday, (Tedhkiret Dáwood,
TA,) will not have ophthalmia in that year. (K.)
