water, and is lukewarm; and the third, in the
earth, or dust, and is hot: the first falling exactly

with any others, nor uniting themselves to any
others: (Lth, TA:) or a tribe that does not unite
itself to any other: (K:) or that comprises three
hundred horsemen, (K,) or the like thereof: (TA:)

extinguished by confederating with Er-Ribáb,
and the second by confederating with Medhhij;
the third only remaining [a جمرة] because it

and جَمْرَةُ العَقَبَةِ, (K,) at which جَمَرَات (i. e. small
pebbles, TA) were cast; (S, K;) each of these
being a heap of pebbles, at Minè, and each two
heaps [or rather each heap and that next to it]
being about a bow-shot apart: (Msb:) accord. to
Th, from جَمَرَهُ “ he put him aside, apart, away,
or at a distance: ” or from أَجْمَرَ “ he hastened; ”
because Adam pelted Iblees in Minè, and he
