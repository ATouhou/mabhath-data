جبر1
جَبَرَ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) aor.
جَبُرَ, (Msb,) inf. n.
جَبْرٌ (S, A, Msb, K, &c.) and جُبُورٌ, (M, K,)
which latter, accord. to MF, is an inf. n. of the
intrans. verb only, but it has been heard as an
inf. n. of the trans. verb also, (TA,) and جِبَارَةٌ,
(Lh, K,) He set a bone; reduced it from a
fractured state; (S, A, Msb, K, &c.;) as also
↓ جبّر, (A, IAmb, K,) inf. n. تَجْبِيرٌ; (TA;) and
↓ اجبر, (Ibn-Talhah, MF, TA,) but this is extremely strange, and not found in the lexicons of
celebrity, (MF,) and not heard by AO; (TA;)
[and ↓ اجتبر.] One says also, يَدَهُ ↓ جبّر, (A,
IAmb,) or جَبَرَهَا, (Msb,) He (a bone-setter) set
his arm, or reduced it from a fractured state:
(A:) or put upon it the جَبِيرَة [or splints]. (Msb.)
―
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) جَبَرَ, (AAF, M, K, &c.,) inf. n.
جَبْرٌ (S, A, K) and جُبُورٌ [but respecting this
latter see above] and جِبَارَةٌ; (K;) and ↓ جبّر,
(K,) inf. n. تَجْبِيرٌ; (TA;) and ↓ اجبر; (Ibn-
Talhah, MF, TA; [but respecting this form see
above;]) and ↓ اجتبر; (K;) (tropical:)  He restored a
man from a state of poverty to wealth, or competence, or sufficiency: (AAF, S, A, K, &c.:) or
he benefited a poor man; conferred a benefit, or
benefits, upon him: (M, K:) but the former is
the more appropriate explanation: (AAF, TA:)
and this signification is tropical; (IDrst, MF,
TA;) the poor man being likened to one who has
a broken bone, and his restoration to wealth, or
competence, being likened to the setting of the
bone; wherefore he is called فَقِيرٌ, as though the
vertebræ of his back were broken: (IDrst, TA:)
in the A it is mentioned as proper, not tropical;
but the author of the A afterwards mentions
جَبَرْتُ فُلَانًا as tropical in the sense of نَعَشْتُهُ (tropical:)  [I
recovered such a one from his embarrassment,
&c.; repaired his broken fortune, or his condition]. (TA.) One says also, جَبَرْتُ فَاقَةَ الرَّجُلِ
(tropical:)  [I repaired the broken fortune of the man;] I
restored the man to wealth, or competence, or
sufficiency. (A Heyth, TA.) And جَبَرْتُ اليَتِيمَ (assumed tropical:)  [I
put the affairs of the orphan into a right, or
good, state: or] I gave to the orphan. (Msb.)
And جَبَرَ (tropical:)  He restored anything to a sound,
right, or good, state. (IDrst, TA.) And جَبَرَهُ اللّٰهُ
(assumed tropical:)  [May God render him sound, and strong]:
said in relation to a child. (S and K in art. زرع.)
And جَبَرْتُ نِصَابَ الزَّكَاةِ بِكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  I made the
amount of the property equal to that which
renders it incumbent on the possessor to pay the
poor-rate, by [adding] such a thing: the name
of that thing is جبران [app. ↓ جُبْرَانٌ]: and the
person who does this is termed ↓ جَابِرٌ. (Msb.)
-A2-  جَبَرَ also signifies He compelled, or constrained,
another. (B.) You say, جَبَرَهُ عَلَى الأَمْرِ, (Lh,
Az, Msb, K,) aor.
جَبُرَ, inf. n. جَبْرٌ and جُبُورٌ, (Msb,)
a chaste form of the verb, of the dial. of El-
Hijáz, (Az, TA,) or of the Benoo-Temeem and of
many of the people of El-Hijáz, (Msb,) or of
Temeem alone; (Lh, TA;) [but said in the Mgh
to be of weak authority;] and ↓ اجبرهُ; (Th, S,
Msb, K, &c.;) both these forms of the verb mentioned by AZ, Fr, A 'Obeyd, and others, (Msb,)
but the latter is the form used by the generality of
the Arabs, (Lh, TA,) and by the grammarians [in
general]; (TA;) He compelled him, against his
will, to do the thing: (Lh, Th, Az, S, Msb, K:) ↓ إِجْبَارٌ
originally signifying the inciting, urging, or inducing, another to restore a thing to a sound,
right, or good, state. (B.) And عَلَى الحُكْمِ ↓ اجبرهُ
He (a judge) compelled him to submit to, or to
perform, the sentence. (L.)
-A3-  Also جَبَرَ, [aor.
جَبُرَ,]
inf. n. جُبُورٌ (S, Msb, K) and جَبْرٌ, (Msb, K,)
which latter, accord. to MF [and the Mgh], is
an inf. n. of the trans. verb only, but it has been
heard as an inf. n. of the intrans. verb also;
(TA;) and ↓ انجبر, (T, S, K,) and ↓ اجتبر, (T,
S,) and ↓ تجبّر; (K;) It (a bone) became set,
or reduced from a fractured state. (T, S, Msb,
K.) ―
-b2-  And [hence,] the first of these verbs,
with the same inf. ns.; (K;) and ↓ اجتبر, (S, *
K,) and ↓ انجبر, and ↓ تجبّر, and ↓ استجبر; (K;)
(tropical:)  He (a poor man, K, and an orphan, TA) became
restored from a state of poverty to wealth, or
competence, or sufficiency: (S, * K:) or received
a benefit, or benefits: (K:) ↓ اجتبر is syn. with
انتعش (tropical:)  [he recovered, or became recovered, from
his embarrassment, &c.]. (A.) [And (assumed tropical:)  It (anything) became restored to a sound, right, or good,
state.] El-' Ajjáj has used جَبَرَ transitively and intransitively in the same sentence, saying,
قَدْ جَبَرَ الدِّينَ الإِلَاهُ فَجَبَرْ
[(assumed tropical:)  God hath restored the religion to a sound,
right, or good, state, and it hath become restored
thereto]: (S:) or, accord. to some, the second
verb is corroborative of the first; the meaning
being, God hath desired, or purposed, to restore
the religion, &c., and hath completed its restoration. (B.)

-A2-  اجبرهُ also signifies
He imputed to him [the tenet of] الجَبْر; (S, * L,
K; *) he called him a جَبَرِىّ: (L:) like as اكفرهُ
signifies “ he imputed to him infidelity. ” (S.)
5
تجبّر: see 1, latter part, in two places. Also
(tropical:)  What had gone from him (a man) returned to
him: (K:) or some of his property that had
gone from him returned to him. (T, TA.) (assumed tropical:)  He
(a sick man) became in a good state. (K.) (assumed tropical:)  It
(a plant, TA, and a tree, K) became green, and
put forth leaves (K, TA) and fresh green twigs,
when dry: produced fresh shoots in its dry parts:
(TA:) it (herbage) became somewhat restored to
a good state after having been eaten: (K, * TA:)
or grew after having been eaten. (S.) ―
-b2-  He
(a man, S) magnified himself; behaved proudly,
haughtily, or insolently. (S, A, K.)
-A2-  (assumed tropical:)  He (a

obtained wealth, or property. (TA.)

إِنْجَبَرَ see 1, latter part, in two places.

which he will not recover]; i. e. مِنْهَا ↓ لَا مَجْبَرَ

-A2-  استجبرهُ (tropical:)  He exerted himself much, or exceedingly, or to the
utmost, in paying frequent attention to him,
taking care of him, or putting his affairs into
a right, or proper, state. (A.)
جَبْرٌ, in computation, (assumed tropical:)  The addition of something for the purpose of reparation. (TA.)
[Hence, الجَبْرُ (assumed tropical:)  Algebra; more commonly called
الجَبْرُ وَالمُقَابَلَةُ perfective addition and compensative subtraction; or restoration and compensation; because of the frequency of these operations
in the reduction of equations.]
-A2-  The contr. of
قَدَرٌ: (S, Msb, K:) it is the assertion that God
compels his servants, or mankind, to commit acts
of disobedience; (Msb;) the virtual denial that
actions proceed from man, and attributing them
to God; the sect that hold the tenet thus termed
asserting that man, with respect to his actions, is
like the feather suspended in the air; whereas
قَدَرٌ signifies the “ virtual attributing of optional,
or voluntary, actions to man; asserting that
man creates his own optional, or voluntary,
actions: ” (IbrD:) A 'Obeyd says that it is a
post-classical term. (S.)
-A3-  A king; (AA, T,
M, K;) of uncertain derivation: (M:) and a
slave, or servant: (A 'Obeyd, Kr, K, &c.:) thus
bearing two contr. significations: (K:) and a
man: (AA, A 'Obeyd, K, &c.:) [see جَبْرَئِيلُ:]
and a young man: and [a] courageous [man]. (K.)
-A4-  [Also, app., Aloes-wood: الجَبْرُ is explained
in the K as signifying العُودُ, which means wood
in general, as well as aloes-wood in particular;
and to this is added in the TA, الذى يُجْبَرُ بِهِ, as
though the meaning were the wood with which
one sets bones; but I think that يُجْبَرُ is a mistranscription for يُجَمَّرُ; and that the meaning is
aloes-wood with which one fumigates.]
جَبَرِىٌّ or جَبْرِىٌّ: see جَبَرِيَّةٌ.
جَبَرُوَّةٌ and جَبْرُوَّةٌ and جَبَرُوتٌ &c.: see what
next follows.
جَبَرِيَّةٌ (S, K) and جَبْرِيَّةٌ and جِبْرِيَّةٌ and جِبِرِيَّةٌ
and ↓ جِبْرِيَآءُ (K) and ↓ جَبَرِيَّآءُ (Aboo-Nasr, TA)
and ↓ جَبَرُوَّةٌ (S, K) and ↓ جَبْرُوَّةٌ (K) and ↓ جَبَرُوتٌ
(S, Msb, K, one of the forms most known, of the
measure فَعَلُوتٌ, like مَلَكُوتٌ and رَهَبُوتٌ and رَغَبُوتٌ
and رَحَمُوتٌ, said to be the only other words of
this measure, though, as MF says, this requires
consideration, TA) and ↓ جُبْرُوتٌ (K) and ↓ جَبْرَؤُوتٌ
(Et-Tedmuree, TA) and ↓ جَبَرُوتَى (K, like رَحَمُوتَى,
[&c.], TA) and ↓ جَبُّورَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ جَبُّورٌ (Lh,

i. e. self-magnification, pride, haughtiness, or insolence; or proud, haughty, or insolent, behaviour; (S, Msb, K;) &c. (K, TA.) Hence,
مَا كَانَتْ نُبُوَّةٌ إِلَّا تَنَاسَخَهَا مُلْكٌ جَبَرِيَّةً [There has
been no prophetic office but a kingly office has
succeeded in its place through some one's selfmagnification, pride, haughtiness, or insolence];
i. e., but kings have magnified themselves, or
behaved proudly or haughtily or insolently, after
it. (A, TA.)
-A2-  الجَبَرِيَّةُ (S, K) and الجَبْرِيَّةُ,
(Th, Msb,) or the latter is a mispronunciation,
or is the correct form, (K,) and the former is so
pronounced in order to assimilate it to القَدَرِيَّةُ;
(Msb, K; *) the latter is the pronunciation of the
scholastic theologians of the persuasion of EshSháfi'ee (El-Háfidh in the “ Tabseer,” B) in old
times, but the term used in the conventional
language of the modern scholastic theologians
is ↓ المُجْبَرَةُ; (B;) and الجبريّة, also, is a postclassical term; (TA;) The contr. of القَدَرِيَّةُ;
(S, K;) the sect who hold the tenet termed جَبْرٌ
[q. v.]; (Msb;) a sect of those who follow
their own natural desires, whose founder was El-
Hoseyn Ibn-Mohammad En-Nejjár El-Basree,
who assert that man has no power; that [what
are termed] voluntary motions are of the same
predicament as a tremour; though this does not
oblige them to deny the imposition of duties;
(Lb, TA;) a sect who assert that God compels
his servants, or mankind, to commit sins: (AHeyth,
TA:) n. un. ↓ جَبَرِىٌّ or جَبْرِىٌّ. (Msb.)

جَبْرَئِيلُ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) imperfectly decl.,
because having the quality of a proper name and
that of a foreign word, or being a compound
regarded as forming a single word, as some say,
(TA,) originally Syriac, or Hebrew, [?,]
(Esh-Shiháb [El-Khafájee],) A proper name of
an angel; (TA;) [Gabriel: and also, of a man:]
signifying the servant of God: (A 'Obeyd, S,
Msb, K, TA:) or (rather, TA) the man of God:
(A 'Obeyd, TA:) being said to be composed of
جَبْرٌ, (S, Msb, TA,) signifying “ servant,” or
“ slave,” (Msb, TA,) or rather “ man,” (TA,) and
إِيلٌ, (S, Msb, TA,) signifying “ God: ” (Msb,
TA:) or both together signify the servant of
the Compassionate: or the servant of the Mighty,
or Glorious: (TA:) this form of the word is of
the dialects of Keys and Temeem: (TA:) and
there are other dial. vars.; namely, ↓ جَبْرَيِيلُ,
without ء , and ↓ جَبْرَائِيلُ , (S, K,) and ↓ جَبْرَايِيلُ ,

(Es-Suyootee, TA,) and ↓ جِبْرِيلُ, (S, Msb, K, which
is the form most known and most chaste, and
is of the dial. of El-Hijáz, TA,) and ↓ جَبْرِيلُ,
(Msb, K, reckoned of weak authority by Fr,
because the measure فَعِّيل [or فَعْلِيل] does not
exist in the language, for as to سَمْوِيل, mentioned
by Esh-Shiháb as against the objection of Fr, it is
of the measure فَعْوِيل, MF, TA,) and ↓ جَبْرَيْلُ,
