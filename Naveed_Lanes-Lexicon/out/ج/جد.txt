aor,
جَدُ3َ, (S, L,) inf. n. جَدٌّ (S, L, K) and جَدَادٌ
(Lh, Mgh, L) and جِدَادٌ; (Lh, L; [in the L, the
last two forms are mentioned as inf. ns., and the
former of them is mentioned as inf. n. in the
Mgh; but in the K, they are only mentioned as
syn. with جَدٌّ; and in the S, it seems to be
implied that they are simple substs., or quasiinf. ns.;]) i. q. صَرَمَهُ; (Lh, S, Mgh, K; *) [like
جَذَّهُ and جَزَّهُ;] i.e., He cut off the fruit of the
palm-trees. (Mgh, L. [See also جَدَادٌ.]) And
جُدَّتْ أَخْلَافُ النَّاقَةِ The she-camel's teats were cut
off by some accident that befell her: (As, TA:)
or, in consequence of injury occasioned to her by
the صِرَار [q. v.]. (S.) And تَجْدِيدٌ [inf. n. of
↓ جدّد] signifies The cutting off the teat of a
camel. (KL.) You say also, جُدَّ ثَدْيَا أُمِّكَ May
thy mother's breasts be cut off: a form of imprecation against a man; and implying a wish for
his separation. (As, L, from a trad.) ―

جَدِ3َ, inf. n. جِدَّةٌ, It (a garment, TA,

(L.) [See also 5.]
-A3-  جَدَّ, like تَعِبَ, (Msb,)
see. pers. جَدِدٌتَ, [like its syn. حَظِظْتَ,] (L,
Msb,) aor. يَجَدُّ; (Msb;) or جُدَّ, with damm,

يُحَظُّونَ بهم, They become possessed of good fortune, and riches, or competence, or sufficiency.
(Ibn-Buzurj, L.) [You say also, جَدَّ جَدُّهُ (tropical:) : so in
a copy of the A: probably a mistranscription for
جَدَّ جِدُّهُ, which see below: if not, meaning His
fortune became good; or his good fortune increased in goodness: or, perhaps, his dignity
became great; from what next follows].
-A4-  جَدّ
فِى عَيْنِى, (S, A,) or فِى عُيُونِ النَّاسِ, and صُدُورِهِمْ,
(Mgh,) aor.
جَدِ3َ, inf. n. جَدٌّ, (S,) He was, or became, great, or of great dignity or estimation, in

[A man of us, when he recited the chapter of
the Cow and that of the Family of 'Imrán (the
second and third chapters of the Kur-án),] used
to be great in our eyes. (S.)
-A5-  جَدَّ فِى الأَمْرِ, (S,
A, K,) or فِى أَمْرِهِ, (L,) or فِى كَلَامِهِ, (Msb,)
aor.
جَدِ3َ (S, L, Msb, K) and
جَدُ3َ, (L, K,) inf. n. جِدٌّ,
(S, K,) or جَدٌّ, (L, Msb,) جِدٌّ being a simple
subst.; (Msb;) and فِيهِ ↓ اجدّ; (L, K;) He was
serious, or in earnest, (S, A, L, Msb, K,) in the
affair, (S, A, K,) or in his affair, (L,) or in his
speech; (Msb;) syn. حَقَّقَ; (L;) contr. of هَزَلَ.
(L, Msb. [In the S and A and K, the inf. n. is
said to signify the contr. of هَزْلٌ; and in the K,
it is also said to be syn. with تَحْقِيقٌ.]) ―
-b2-  And جَدَّ
فِى الأَمْرِ, (As, S, L, Msb, K,) aor.
جَدِ3َ and
جَدُ3َ, (S, Msb,
K,) inf. n. جِدٌّ, (S, * K, * TA,) or this is a simple
subst., and the inf. n. is جَدٌّ; (Msb;) and فيه ↓ اجدّ;
(As, S, L, K;) signify also He strove, laboured,
or toiled; exerted himself or his power or efforts or
endeavours or ability; employed himself vigorously,
strenuously, laboriously, diligently, studiously, sedulously, earnestly, or with energy; was diligent,
or studious; took pains, or extraordinary pains;
in the affair. (As, S, L, Msb, K.) And جَدَّفِى
السَّيْرِ He strove, laboured, toiled, or exerted himself, in going, or journeying, or in his course,
or pace; (tropical:)  he hastened therein: and in like
manner, السَّيْرَ ↓ اجدّ (assumed tropical:) he hastened his course, or
pace. (L.) And جَدَّ جِدُّهُ, [meaning His labour,
or exertion, or energy, was, or became, great,
or extraordinary: or] meaning اِزْدَادَ جِدُّهُ جِدًّا
[his labour, &c., increased in labour, &c.]: or it
may mean what was not [his] جِدّ, became جِدّ;
wherefore, i. e. because it would be so eventually,
it is here so called. (Ham p. 33. [See also
جَدَّ جَدُّهُ, above.] ―
-b3-  جَدَّ بِهِ الأَمْرُ (A, L) (tropical:) The
affair, or event, distressed, or afflicted, him.
(L.) So in the saying of Aboo-Sahm,
أَخَالِدُ لَا يَرْضَى عَنِ العَبْدِ رَبُّهُ
إِذَا جَدَّ بِالشَّيْخِ العُقُوقُ المُصَمِّمُ
[O Khálid, his Lord will not approve of the
servant, or man, (meaning the son,) when cutting,
or biting, disobedience to a parent distresses the
old man]. (L.)

in a garment. (KL.)
3
جادّهُ فِى الأَمْرِ, (S, L, K, *) inf. n. مُجَادَّةٌ,
(L,) i. q. حَاقَّهٌ (S, L) or حَاقَقَهُ (K) [He contended with him respecting a thing, each of them
asserting his right therein: so accord. to explanations of حاقّهُ in the lexicons: but I think
that the meaning intended here is, he acted
seriously, or in earnest, with him in the affair;
and this is confirmed by its being immediately
added in the TA, after حاققه, “and أَجَدَّ ” signifies “ حَقَّقَ, as above mentioned: ” see جَدَّفِى
الأَمْرِ expl. by حَقَّقَ as contr. of هَزَلَ]. Also He
exerted his full effort, or endeavour, or energy,
with him in the affair. (So accord. to an explanation of the inf. n., مجادَة, in the KL.)
4
اجدّ النَّخْلُ The palm-trees attained to the
time for the cutting off of the fruit. (S, A, * L,
Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, perhaps,] أَجَدَّتْ قَرُنِى مِنْهُ
I (myself, TA) relinquished, or forsook, him, or
it. (K.)
-A2-  اجدّهُ, and ↓ استجدّهُ, (S, A, L, K,)
and ↓ جدّدهُ, (S, L, K,) He made it new; (S, A,
L, K;) namely, a thing, (S,) or a garment: (A,
TA:) or he put it on, or wore it, new; namely,
a garment. (TA.) One says to him who puts
on a new garment, أَبْلِ وَأَجِدَّ وَاحْمَدِ الكَاسِى [Wear
out, and make, or put on, new, and praise the
Clother, meaning God]. (S.) And you say,
بَهِىَ بَيْتُ فُلَانٍ فَأَجَدَّ بَيْتًا مِنْ شَعَرٍ [The tent of
such a one was, or became, rent, or pierced with
holes; therefore he made a new tent of haircloth]. (S.) And الأَمْرَ ↓ جدّد, and اجدّهُ, and
↓ استجدّهُ, He originated, or innovated, the thing,
or affair; or did it newly, or for the first time
(Msb.) And الوُضُوْءَ ↓ جدّد (tropical:)  [He renewed the
ablution termed وضوء], and العَهْدَ (tropical:)  [the compact,
or contract, or covenant, &c.]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  اجدّ
فُلَانٌ أَمْرَهُ بِذٰلِكَ Such a one established, or settled,
firmly his affair, or case, thereby, or therein:
so says As, and he cites the following verse:
أَجَدَّ بِهَا أَمْرًا وَأَيْقَنَ أَنَّهُ
لَهَا أَوْخْرَي كَالطَّحِينَ تُرَابُهَا
[He established, or settled, firmly his case thereby,
or therein, and knew certainly that he was for
it, (app. meaning a war, or battle, حَرْب, which
is fem.,) or for another whereof the dust would
be like flour]: Aboo-Nasr says, It has been related to me that he said, اجدَ بها امرًا means اجدّ
أَمْرَهُ بِهَا; [and so this phrase is explained in the
K;] but the former explanation I heard from
himself: (L:) or this phrase means أَجَدَّ أَمْرُهُ بِهَا
[so in two copies of the S, app., (assumed tropical:)  his affair, or
case, became easy, or practicable, thereby, like
ground termed جَدَد, which is easy to walk, or
travel, upon; see the next sentence]; امر being
put in the accus. case as a specificative, like عَيْنًا
in the phrase قَرِرْتُ بِهِ عَيْنًا, meaning قَرَّتْ بِهِ عَيْنِى.
(S.)
-A3-  اجدّ also signifies It (a road) was, or
became, what is termed جَدَد [i. e. hard, or level,
&c.]. (S, K.) And اجدّت لَكَ الأَرْضُ The ground
hath become to thee free from soft places, and
clear to thy view. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also He walked
along, or traversed, what is termed جَدَد. (K.)
And اجدّ القَوْمُ The people, or company of men,
came to what is so termed: (S:) and ascended
upon the surface (جَدِيد) of the ground: or went
upon sand such as is termed جَدَد. (TA.)
-A4-  See
also 1, in three places.
5
تجدّد [originally It became cut, or cut off.
―
-b2-  And hence,] It (an udder) lost, or became
devoid of, its milk: (S, K:) and [in like manner]
↓ جُدَّ, aor. يُجَدُّ, inf. n. جَدَدٌ, it, (a breast, and
an udder,) became dry. (A Heyth, TA.) ―
-b3-  Hence
also, [It was newly made; as though newly cut
off from the web;] said of a garment: (TA:)
and it (a thing, S, A) became new: (S, A, K:)
and it (a thing, or an affair,) originated; was
originated, or innovated; or was done newly, or
for the first time: and sometimes ↓ استجدّ is used
intransitively [in the same senses]. (Msb.) [Also
(assumed tropical:)  It (an action, as, for instance, ablution, and a
compact, or the like,) was renewed. See جَدَّدَ as
syn. with أَجَدَّ.]
10
إِسْتَجْدَ3َ see 4, in two places:
-A2-  and see also 5.
جَدٌّ Fortune, or particularly good fortune,
syn. حَظٌّ, (S, A, Mgh, L, K,) and بَخْتٌ, (S, A,
L, K,) in the world, or in wordly circumstances;
(TA;) advance in the world, or in worldly circumstances: (Mgh:) pl. [of mult.] جُدُودٌ (S)
and [of pauc.] أَجْدَادٌ and أَجُدٌّ. (TA.) You
say, فُلَانٌ ذُو جَدٍّ فِى كَذَا Such a one is possessed
of good fortune in such a thing. (L.) And it
is said in a trad. respecting the day of resurrection, وَإِذَا أَصْحَابُ الجَدِّ مَحْبُوسُونَ And lo, the
people who were possessed of good fortune and
riches in the world were imprisoned. (L.) And
in a prayer, (L,) لَا يَنْفَعُ ذَا الجَدِّ مِنْكَ الجَدُّ The
good worldly fortune of him who is possessed of
such fortune will not profit him, (Mgh, L,) in
the world to come, (L,) in lieu of Thee; (Mgh,
L; *) i. e., of obedience to Thee: (Mgh, and
Mughnee in art. مِنْ:) or in lieu of the good
fortune that cometh from Thee: or, as some say,
will not defend him from Thee. (Mughnee ubi
suprà. [See also another explanation below.])
Hence, أَجَدَّكَ لَا تَفْعَلْ [or أَجَدِّكَ]; and, accord. to
some, وَجَدِّكَ: see جِدٌّ. ―
-b2-  One's lot in life; and
the means of subsistence that one receives from the
bounty of God. (L, K.) One says, لِفُلَانٍ فِى
هٰذَا الأَمْرِ جَدٌّ Such a one has in this thing, or
state of affairs, means of subsistence. (A'Obeyd,
L.) ―
-b3-  Richness; competence, or sufficiency; or
the state of being in no need, or of having no wants,
or of having few wants. (S, L, Msb.) لا ينفع ذا
الجدّ منك الجدّ, [explained above, is said to
mean] Riches, &c., will not profit the possessor
thereof with Thee; for nothing will profit him
but acting in obedience to Thee: منك here signifies عِنْدَكَ. (S, Msb.) ―
-b4-  Greatness, or majesty;
(Mujáhid, S, Mgh, Msb, K;) accord. to some,
specially of God: (TA:) so in the Kur lxxii. 3:
(S, TA:) or his freedom from all wants or the
like; syn. غِنًى. (S.) Hence, تَعَالَى جَدُّكَ, (Mgh,
TA,) in a trad. respecting prayer, (TA,) Exalted
be thy greatness, or majesty. (Mgh, * TA.) ―
-b5-
See also أَجَدَّكَ, as an interrogative phrase, voce
جِدٌّ.
-A2-  Also, (S, K,) and ↓ مَجْدُودٌ, (S, A, Mgh,
K,) and ↓ جَدِيدٌ, (S, Msb, K,) and ↓ جَدِّيٌّ, (S,)
and ↓ جُدٌّ, and ↓ جُدِّيٌّ, the last two with damm,
(K,) applied to a man, Fortunate; or possessed
of good fortune; (S, A, Mgh, Msb;) or possessed
of good worldly fortune: (TA:) or possessing
great fortune, or great good fortune: (K:) [the
words here given from the S are there coupled
with synonyms of the same form, thus; ↓ جَدِيدٌ
حَظِيظٌ, and مَحْظُوظٌ ↓ مَجْدُودق, and جَدٌّ حَظُّ,
and حَظِّىٌّ ↓ جَدِّيٌّ; on the authority of ISk:]
↓ جُدٌّ, with damm, as an epithet applied to a
man, is said by Sb to be syn. with مَجْدُودٌ; and
its pl. is جُدٌّونَ only. (L.)
-A3-  Also جَدُّ, A
grandfather; the father's father, and the mother's
father: (S, Msb, K:) and (assumed tropical:)  a higher ascendant;
an ancestor: (Msb:) and ↓ جَدَّةٌ a grandmother;
the father's mother, and the mother's mother:
(K:) [and (assumed tropical:)  a female ancestor:] pl. of the
former, أَجْدَادٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and جُدُودٌ and
جُدُودَةٌ: (K:) and of the latter, جَدَّاتٌ. (TA.)
Hence, accord. to some, وَجَدِّكَ لَا تَفْعَلْ: see جِدٌّ.
-A4-  See also جُدَّةٌ: ―
-b2-  and see جَدِيدٌ.
جُدٌّ: see جَدٌّ, in two places.
-A2-  See also جُدَّةٌ.
―
-b2-  Also The side (جَانِب) of anything. (K.)
-A3-
And A well in a place where is much herbage,
or pasture: (S, Msb, K:) a well abounding with
water; (K;) [and] so ↓ جُدْجُدٌ; (KL;) but
A'Obeyd says that this is not known: (L:) and,
contr., a well containing little water: a scanty
water, or water little in quantity: a water at
the extremity of a [desert such as is called] فَلَاة:
(K:) an old water: (Th, K:) an old well:
(KL:) pl. (in all these senses, TA) أَجْدَادٌ.
(Msb, TA.)
جِدٌّ [accord. to some an inf. n., but accord. to
others a simple subst., (see جَدَّ,)] Seriousness,
or earnestness, contr. of هَزْلٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) in
speech. (Msb.) Hence, ثَلَاثٌ جِدُّهُنَّ جِدٌّ وَهَزْلُهُنَّ
جِدٌّ [There are three things in relation to which
what is serious is serious and what is jesting is
serious]: a saying of Mohammad, whereby he
forbade a man's divorcing and emancipating and
marrying and then retracting, saying “ I was
jesting; ” as was customary in the time of
paganism. (Msb.) أَجِدَّكَ and ↓ أَجَدَّكَ signify
the same; (S;) but the former is the more
chaste; (TA;) جِدّ and جَدّ being thus used only
as prefixed nouns: (S, K:) As says that the
meaning is, أَبِجِدٍّ مِنْكَ هٰذَا [Does this proceed
from thee in seriousness, or in earnest?]; and
that جِدّ is put in the accus. case because of the
rejection of the [prep.] ب: AA says that the
meaning is, مَا لَكَ أَجِدًّا مِنْكَ [What aileth thee?
Doth it proceed from thee in seriousness, or in
earnest?]; and that جدّ is put in the accus. case
as an inf. n.: Th says that the phrase as it occurs
in poetry is أَجِدَّكَ, with kesr: (S:) but when
it occurs with وَ [in the place of أَ, or with أَ in the
sense of وَ, as a particle denoting an oath,] it is
↓ وَجَدِّكَ [or أَجَدِّكَ], with fet-h: (S, K:) yon
say, وَجَدِّكَ لَا تَفْعَلْ, (K, in the CK وَجَدَّكَ,)
meaning, By thy grandfather, do not [such a
thing]: or by thy fortune, or good fortune, do
not: (TA:) also, when you say, أَجِدَّكَ لَا تَفْعَلْ,
[or أَجِدِّكَ, for أَ (q. v.) is substituted for a particle
of swearing, as in أَللّٰهِ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ,] the meaning is,
I adjure thee by thy truth, (Lth, K,) and by thy
seriousness, or earnestness, (Lth, TA,) do not:
and when you say, لَا تَفْعَلْ ↓ أَجَدَّكَ, [or أَجَدِّكَ,]
the meaning is, I adjure thee by thy fortune, or
good fortune, do not: (Lth, K:) Aboo- 'Alee
Esh-Shalowbeenee asserts that it implies the signification of an oath. (MF.) In the phrase
اجدّك لا تَفْعَلُ, AAF says, we may consider
لا تفعل as put in the place of a denotative of state;
or the phrase may be originally اجدّك أَنْ لَا تَفْعَلَ,
ان being suppressed, and its government annulled:
[therefore it may be rendered, in the former case,
Is it with seriousness on thy part, thou doing
such a thing? and in the latter case, Is it with
seriousness on thy part that thou will not do such
a thing? i. e. dost thou mean seriously that thou
will not do it? or in this case, اجدّك may be
used as a form of adjuration in one of the senses
explained above, and لَا تَفْعَلُ may mean, that
thou do not such a thing; or اجدّك may mean
وَجَدَّكَ, (explained above, and so in the three exs.
below,) and لَا تَفْعَلُ, thou wilt not do it:] and,
as AHei says, there is here a nice point, which is
this; that the noun [meaning the pronoun] to
which جدّ is prefixed should agree in person
with the verb which follows it; so that one should
say, اجدِّى لَا أُكْرِمُكَ, and اجدّكَ لَا تَفْعَلُ, and
اجدّهُ لَا يَزُورُنَا; because جدّ is an inf. n. corroborating the proposition that follows it. (MF.) ―
-b2-  Also,
[and in this case, likewise, accord. to some an inf. n.,
but accord. to others a simple subst., (see, again,
جَدَّ,)] A striving, labour, or toil; exertion of one's
self, or of one's power or efforts or endeavours or
ability; vigorousness, strenuousness, laboriousness,
diligence, studiousness, sedulousness, earnestness,
or energy; painstaking, or extraordinary painstaking; (S, L, Msb, K;) in affairs, (S,) or in an
affair. (Msb, K.) Hence, جِدًّا [meaning In a
great, or an extraordinary, degree; greatly,
much, exceedingly, or extraordinarily; very;
very greatly, or very much; extremely]; as in
the phrase, (Msb,) فُلَانٌ مُحْسِنٌ جِدًّا [Such a
one is beneficent in a great, or an extraordinary,
degree; very, exceedingly, or extremely, beneficent]: you should not say جَدًّا. (S, Msb. * [In
my copy of the Msb, it is محسن جدّا بالفتح:
but the context shows that there is an omission
here, and that, after جدّا, we should read, as in
the S, وَلَا تَقُلْ جَدًّا.]) جِدًّا [in a phrase of this
kind] is put in the accus. case as an inf. n. [of
which the verb is understood; so that, in the ex.
given above, the proper meaning is, يَجِدُّ فِى
الإِحْسَانِ جِدًّا striving in beneficence with a great
striving]; because it is not from the same root
as the preceding word, nor is it identical with it
[in meaning]. (L.) You say also, فِى هٰذَا خَطَرٌ
جِدَّ عَظِيمٍ, meaning عَظِيمٌ جِدًّا [(assumed tropical:)  In this is a
very, or an extremely, great danger, or risk].
(S.) And هٰذا العَالِمُ جِدَّ العَالِمِ This is the learned
man, the extremely [or the very] learned man.
(L.) And هٰذَا عَالِمٌ جِدَّ عَالِمٍ This is a learned
man, an extremely [or a very] learned man.
(L, * K.) ―
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  Haste. (S, L, K, TA.) So in
the phrase فُلَانٌ عَلَى جِدِّ أَمْرٍ (tropical:)  Such a one is in
haste in an affair. (S, L, TA.)
-A2-  Also Executed
seriously, or in earnest, [in which there is no
jesting,] and excessive; syn. مُحَقَّقٌ مُبَالَغٌ فِيهِ
[meaning مُحَقَّقٌ فِيهِ وَمُبَالَغٌ فِيهِ; (see جَدَّ فِى أَمْرِهِ;)
جِدٌّ thus used as an epithet having an intensive
signification because it is originally an inf. n.,
or as some say, a simple subst.]: (L, K:) applied
in this sense to a punishment: (L:) and also
applied to a pace. (K in art. نص.)
-A3-  See also
جُدَّةٌ: ―
-b2-  and see جَدِيدٌ.
جَدَّةٌ: see جَدٌّ, near the end of the paragraph.
جُدَّةٌ The bank, or side, or a river; as also
جِدَّةٌ and ↓ جِدٌّ (IAth, L, K) and ↓ جُدٌّ (IAth,
Mgh, L) and ↓ جَدٌّ, (Mgh, L, K,) accord. to some,
but correctly جُدٌّ; so called because cut off from
the river, or because cut by the water, in like
manner as it is called سَاحِلٌ because it is abraded
by the water: (Mgh:) or the part of a river
that is near the land; as also ↓ جِدَّةٌ: (L:) and
the shore of the sea: (MF:) accord. to As, جدّة
is an arabicized word from the Nabathean كدّ.
(L.) ―
-b2-  The stripe, or streak, that is on the back
of the ass, differing from his general colour. (S,
A, * K.) And (tropical:)  A streak (Fr, S, K, TA) in anything, (TA,) as in a mountain, (Fr, S,) differing
in colour from the rest of the mountain, (S,)
white and black and red; (Fr, TA;) as also in
the sky: (A, TA:) pl. جُدَدٌ, (Fr, S,) occurring
in the Kur xxxv. 25; (S;) where some read
جُدُدٌ, pl. of ↓ جديدة [app. جَدِيدَةٌ], which is syn.
with جُدَّةٌ; and some, جَدَدٌ [q. v.]. (Bd.) ―
-b3-  A
sign, or mark, syn. عَلَامَةٌ, (Th, K,) of, or in,
anything. (Th, TA.) ―
-b4-  A beaten way, marked
with lines [cut by the feet of the men and beasts
that have travelled along it]: (Az, L:) or a
road, or way: pl. جُدَدٌ: (Msb:) and جُدُودٌ,

-b4-  A collar upon the neck of a dog:
(Th, L, K:) pl. جُدَدٌ [like لُحًى pl. of لِحْيَةٌ, or

(Har p. 522:) [see also جَدْجَدٌ:] or rough level
ground: (K:) or rough ground: or level ground:

هٰذَا زَمَنُ الجَدَادِ and الجِدَادِ [This is the time, or
season, of the cutting off of the fruit of the palmtrees]. (S, A, Msb. *) Some say that جداد signifies particularly [as above,] the cutting off [of
the fruit] of palm-trees; and جذاذ, the cutting
off of all fruits, in a general sense: others say
that they signify the same. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also The
time, or season, of the cutting off of the fruit of
palm-trees. (S, * L.) You say جَدَادٌ and جِدَادٌ,
like صَرَامٌ and صِرَامٌ, and قَطَافٌ and قِطَافٌ; (Ks,
S;) whence it seems as though the measures
فَعَالٌ and فِعَالٌ were uniformly applicable to every
noun signifying the time of the action; such
nouns being likened to أَوَانٌ and إِوَانٌ. (S.)
جِدَادٌ: see جَدَادٌ, and جَادٌّ.
جَدُودٌ, (ISk, S, A, K,) or جَدُودَةٌ, (L,) Having
little milk, (ISk, S,) or not from any imperfection; (L;) applied to a ewe, (ISk, S, K,) but

أَبِى حُبِّى سُلَيْمَى أَنْ يَبِيدَا

[My love of Suleymà hath refused to perish; but
her cord (i. e. her tie of affection to me) hath
become worn out and cut]: (S:) [as جديد signifies “new” more commonly than "cut,"] this
verse appears as though it involved a contradiction. (MF.) ―
-b2-  Applied to a garment, or a piece
of cloth [sufficient for a garment or the like],
Newly cut off [from the web] by the weaver:
(S, K:) and so (without ة, S) applied to a
مِلْحَفَة; (S, A;) thus applied to a fem. n. because
syn. with ↓ مَجْدُودَةٌ; (S, ISd;) or, accord. to
Sb, because by ملحفة in this case is meant إِزَار,
and for a like reason in like cases; (Ham p. 555;)
but one also says جَدِيدَةٌ; (ISd;) and accord. to
some, جديد is of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of
the measure فَاعِلٌ, and therefore the ة is regularly
affixed to it: (Ham ubi suprà:) the pl. is جُدُدٌ (Mbr,
Th, S, A, K) and جُدَدٌ; (AZ, A'Obeyd, Mbr;) but
the former is the more common. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And
hence, (L,) applied to a garment, (L, TA,) or a thing,
(S, Msb,) New; contr. of قَدِيمٌ, (Msb,) or contr.
of خَلَقٌ; (S, L;) from جِدَّةٌ as contr. of بِلًى:
(K:) pl. [of pauc.] أَجِدَّةٌ and [of mult.] جُدُدٌ and
جُدَدٌ. (L.) You say, أَصْبَحَتْ خَلَقُهُمْ جُدُدًا, a
phrase mentioned by Lh, meaning خُلْقَانُهُمْ جُدُدًا
[i. e. Their old worn-out garments became replaced
by new]: or جُدُدًا may be here put for جَدِيدًا.
(L.) ―
-b4-  And hence, (TA,) الجَدِيدَانِ and ↓ الأَجَدَّانِ
The night and the day; (S, Msb, K;) because
they never become impaired by time. (TA.) You
say, لَا أَفْعَلُهُ مَا اخْتَلَفَ الجَدِيدَانِ and ↓ الأَجَدَّانِ
[I will not do it while the day and the night
succeed each other]: (S:) or مَا كَرَّ الجَدِيدَانِ

جَدِيدُ المَوْتِ means The commencement of death.

boards of a horse's saddle: there are two such
things, called جَدِيدَتَانِ: (S:) or the جديدتان
consist of the felt that is stuck, or attached, in the
inner side of a horse's and of a camel's saddle:
(L:) but جديدة thus applied is a post-classical
word: the [classical] Arabs say جَدْيَةٌ, (S,) or,
as in J's own handwriting, جَدِيَّةٌ. (So in the
margin of a copy of the S.)

-A2-  أَجَادُّ أَنْتَ أَمْ هَازِلٌ Art
thou serious or jesting? (A.) It is said in a
trad., لَا يَأْخُذَنَّ أَحَدُكُمْ مَتَاعَ أَخِيهِ لَاعِبًا جَادًّا [By
no means shall any one of you take the property of
his brother in play and in earnest]; by which is
meant taking a thing without meaning to steal it,
but meaning to vex and anger the owner, so that
the taker is in play with respect to theft, but in
earnest in annoying. (TA in art. لعب.) ―
-b2-  فُلَانٌ جَادٌّ
Such a one is striving, labouring, or toiling;
exerting himself or his power or efforts or endeavours or ability; &c. (TA.) And ↓ فُلَانٌ جَادٌّ مُجِدٌّ,

↓ مَجْدُودٌ. (L.) It is said in a trad. of Aboo-Bekr, عِشْرِينَ وَسْقًا  ↓ نَهَلَ عَائِشَةَ جِدَادَ, meaning
He gave to 'Áïsheh palm-trees of which the quantity
of the dates cut therefrom was a hundred camel-loads; but the phrase heard from the Arabs is
جَادَّ عِشْرِينَ: the former is like the saying هٰذِهِ
الدَّرَاهِمُ ضَرْبُ الأَمِيرِ; and the latter, like عِيشَةٌ
رَاضِيَةٌ. (Mgh.)
جَادَّةٌ The main part of a road; (S, Mgh, Msb,
