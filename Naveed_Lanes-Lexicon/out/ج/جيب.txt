for the head to be put through: or such an opening as a sleeve and a طَوْق: (MF:) pl. [of mult.]
جُيُوبٌ, (Msb, K,) also pronounced جِيُوبٌ, (TA,)
[like بِيُوتٌ for بُيُوتٌ,] and [of pauc.] أَجْيَابٌ:
(Msb:) this is said to be its proper art., (K, TA,)
not جوب, because its pl. is جُيُوبٌ. (TA.) [The
Arabs often carry things within the bosom of the
shirt &c.; and hence the word is now applied by
them to A pocket.] ―

art. نصح.]) A poet says,
وَخَشَّنْتَ صَدْرًا جَيْبُهُ لَكَ نَاصِحُ
(assumed tropical:)  [And thou hast exasperated a bosom the heart
of which was faithful to thee]. (TA.) You say
also, هُوَ دَنِسُ الجَيْبِ (assumed tropical:)  [He is a person of foul
heart]. (A in art. دنس.) And رَدَعَ جَيْبَهُ عَنْهُ
(assumed tropical:)  He cleared his heart, or bosom, of it. (K in
