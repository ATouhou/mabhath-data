جَعْبَةٌ A كِنَانَة [or quiver] (A, K) for arrows
(S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) of the kind called نُشَّاب
(S, A, Msb, K) and for those that are called نَبْل
also: (Ham p. 154:) but some make a distinction between جَعْبَةٌ and كِنَانَةٌ: the former, they
say, is for نشّاب; and the latter, for نبل: (Mz,
MF:) accord. to IDrd, the كنانة is only for نبل,
and is of leather: that which is of wood is called
جَفِير: and that which is of two pieces [of wood]
joined together is called قرن [i. e. قَرَنٌ]: (Ham
ubi suprà:) accord. to ISh, the جعبة is round
and wide, with a cover on the top, over its mouth:
the وَفْضَة is smaller, and its upper and lower parts
are of equal size; whereas the جعبة is wide in
its upper part, and contracted in its lower part;
wide in its upper part that the feathers of the
arrows [having ample room] may not become
detached; for the arrows are put in the quiver
with the points downwards: each of these two
kinds is made of two corresponding pieces of
wood: (TA:) the pl. is جِعَابٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and
جَعَبَاتٌ. (Msb.) You say, نَكَبُوا الجِعَابَ وَسَكَبُوا
النُّشَّابَ [They inverted, or inclined, the quivers,
and poured forth the arrows]. (A, TA.) And
مَعَهُ جَعْبَةٌ فِيهَا بَنَاتُ المَوْتِ [With him is a quiver
in which are the daughters of death; i. e., deadly
arrows]. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also The largest of drinking-vessels. (MF, TA.)
جُعْبُوبٌ A man (S) short, and ugly, or contemptible; or ugly, and small in body: (S, K:)
or weak, and destitute of good: or vile, or mean,
and despicable: (K:) or a low, mean, or sordid,
and weak man: pl. جَعَابِيبُ. (TA.)
جِعَابَةٌ The art of making quivers of the kind
called جِعَاب, pl. of جَعْبَةٌ. (A, K.)
جِعَابِىٌّ: see what next follows.
جَعَّابٌ [and app. ↓ جِعَابِىٌّ also, as seems to be

surname, but in the CK written جَعّابىّ,] A maker
of quivers of the kind called جِعَاب. (A, K.)
مِجْعَبٌ One who often prostrates, or throws
