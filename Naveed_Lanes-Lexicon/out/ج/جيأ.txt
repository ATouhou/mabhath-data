جيأ1
جَآءَ, aor. يَجِىْءُ, inf. n. مَجِىْءٌ (S, Msb, K,
&c., [the most common form, but] deviating from
the general rule [respecting inf. ns. of this class],
for the inf. n. of a verb of the form فَعَلَ having
its aor. of the form يَفْعِلُ is [accord. to the general
rule, if commencing with an augmentative م,]
مَفْعَلٌ, though some words, beside مَجِىْءٌ, deviate
from this rule by being of the measure مَفْعِلٌ, [for
مَجِىْءٌ is originally مَجْيِئٌ,] as مَعِيشٌ and مَكِيلٌ
and مَصِيرٌ and مَسِيرٌ and مَحِيدٌ and مَمِيلٌ and
مَقِيلٌ and مَزِيدٌ and مَعِيلٌ and مَبِيعٌ and مَحِيصٌ
and مَحِيضٌ, S, * TA) and جَيْئَةٌ (S, K, of the form
of an inf. n. of un., but used as an inf. n. in an
absolute sense, like رَجْفَةٌ and رَحْمَةٌ, S, TA) and
جَىْءٌ, (K,) He, or it, came; or was, or became,
present; syn. أَتَى; (S, K;) or حَضَرَ, said of a
man [&c.]; (Msb;) or حَصَلَ [meaning it came,
came to pass, happened, took place, betided, befell,
or occurred; it resulted; it ensued; &c.]; and
it is used in relation to ideal, as well as real, substantives; so that إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ اللّٰهِ [When the
assistance of God shall come (in the Kur ex. 1)]
is [not a figurative but] a proper phrase. (Er-Rághib, TA.) Sb mentions, on the authority of
certain of the Arabs, هُوَ يَجِيكَ [for هو يَجِيْؤُكَ
He comes, or will come, to thee], with the hemzeh
suppressed: (TA:) and he also mentions يَجُوْءُ
as a dial. var. of يَجِىْءُ. (Id. in art. جوأ, q. v.)
[As shown above,] جَآءَ is used intransitively and
transitively. (Msb, MF.) say, جَآءَ زَيْدٌ Zeyd
came; or was, or became, present. (Msb.) And
جِئْتُ مَجِيْئًا حَسَنًا [I came with a good coming;
or in a good manner]. (S.) And جِئْتُ زَيْدًا I
came to Zeyd. (Msb.) And sometimes one says,
جِئْتُ إِلَيْهِ meaning I went [as well as I came] to
him, or it. (Msb.) And جِئْتُ مِنَ البَلَدِ [I came
from the town, or country]: and مِنَ القَوْمِ,
meaning مِنْ عِنْدِ القَوْمِ [from the presence of the
people, or company of men]. (Msb.) And جَآءَ
الغَيْثُ The rain [came, or] descended. (Msb.)
And جَآءَ أَمْرُ السُّلْطَانِ The order, or command, of
the Sultán came, or arrived. (Msb.) And جِئْتُ
بِهِ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ أَجَأْتُهُ, both signifying the
same, (S, K,) [I came with him, or it;] I brought
him, or it, with me. (Msb.) And الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ الَّذِى
جَآءَ بِكَ [Praise be to God who brought thee];
and الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ إِذْ جِئْتَ [Praise be to God because,
or that, thou camest, or hast come]; but not
الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ الَّذِى جِئْتَ: (S, TA:) and [in like
manner] you say, الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ إِذْ كَانَ كَذَا; but
not الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ الَّذِى كَانَ كَذَا unless you say بِهِ
or مِنْهُ or عَنْهُ [after الذى]. (ISk, TA.) [Hence,
جَآءَ بِوَلَدٍ He begot a child, or children; like أَتَى
بِوَلَدٍ. And جَآءتْ بِهِ She brought him forth; gave
birth to him; like أَتَتْ بِهِ. And جَآءَ بِمَعْنًى It (a
word) conveyed, or imported, a meaning.] ―
-b2-
[جَآءَ بِشَىْءٍ also signifies He brought to pass, did,
executed, performed, or effected, a thing: and he
said, gave utterance to, or uttered, a thing: like
أَتَى بِهِ in both these senses.] And جَآءَ كَذَا He
did thus, or such a thing. (TA.) Hence, [in the
Kur xix. 28,] لَقَدْ جِئْتِ شَيْئًا فَرِيًّا (TA) [Verily, O
Mary, thou hast done] a thing hitherto unknown;
a thing deemed strange. (Bd. [See another ex.
voce إِمْرٌ, likewise from the Kur.]) And جِئْتُ شَيْئًا
حَسَنًا I did a good thing. (Msb.) And جَآءَ بِالبَدِيعِ
He produced a new saying, or new poetry, not
after the similitude of anything preceding. (TA
in art. بدع.) And جَآءَ جَرْيًا بَعْدَ جَرْىٍ (K in art.
تأم) or [more commonly] جاء بِجَرْىٍ بَعْدَ جَرْىٍ
(M in that art.) [He (a horse) performed, or
fetched, run after run]. ―
-b3-  جَآء is also syn. with
صَارَ, like أَتَى; as in the saying, جَآءَ البِنَآءُ مُحْكَمًا
The building became, or came to be, firm, strong,
or compact. (Kull p. 11.) [And hence the phrase,]
مَا جَآءَتْ حَاجَتَكَ, (M, K,) thus in all the copies of
the K, with the noun in the accus. case; i. e.
What became, or has become, thy want? syn.
مَا صَارَتْ; (M, K;) or What was thy want? syn.
مَا كَانَتْ: (Er-Radee, TA:) ما being here an
interrogative, and the [implied] pronoun [in the
verb] being made fem. because its predicate is
fem.: but some say حَاجَتُكَ, in the nom. case, [as
it is in the CK, meaning What did, or has, thy
want become?] regarding حاجتك as the subject of
جاءت, and ما as the predicate of this verb. (TA.)

مُجَايَأَةٌ [inf. n. of جَايَأَ] signifies The act of
facing, or fronting; being opposite, or over
against: (IAar, K:) and the act of coinciding;
as also جِيَآءٌ. (AZ, K.) You say of a man,
جَايَأَنِى مِنْ قُرْبٍ He faced me, fronted me, was
opposite to me, or was over against me, at a short
distance. (TA.) And مَرَّ بِى مُجَايَأَةً He passed
by me being in front, or opposite. (TA.) And
جَايَأْتُ فُلَانًا I coincided with such a one in his
coming. (TA.) And لَوْ جَاوَزْتَ هٰذَا المَكَانَ لَجَايَأْتَ
الغَيْثَ Hadst thou passed beyond this place, thou
hadst met with rain, or coincided with rain in its
coming. (TA.) ―
-b2-  ↓ جَاآنِى فَجِئْتُهُ, [so in copies
of the S, and in copies of the K, as from the S,
but in the TA, as from the S, جَآءَأَنِى, and said to
be with two hemzehs, though this is evidently
wrong,] aor. أَجِيْؤُهُ, the former verb of the measure فَاعَلَنِى, (S,) is [said to be] a mistake for
جَايَأَنِى فجئته, since the former verb has an
infirm letter [ى] for its medial radical and ء for
its final, not the reverse, (Sgh, K,) [therefore]
what J says is not allowable unless it be an
instance of transposition; (IB, TA;) but what is
given by F [and Sgh as the correct form] is that
which is accord. to rule, and what J says is that
which has been heard from the Arabs, as ISd has
pointed out; (TA;) [and rule is not to be regarded when it is contr. to classical usage;] the
meaning is, He vied with me, or strove to surpass
me, in frequency of coming, and I surpassed him
therein. (S, K.)

أَجَاءَهُ He made him, or it, to come. (Kull
p. 11.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] أَجَأْتُهُ i. q. جِئْتُ بِهِ: see 1.
(S, K.) ―
-b3-  أَجَأْتُهُ إِلَيْهِ I compelled him, constrained
him, or necessitated him, to have recourse, or
betake himself, to it; (Fr, S, K;) or made him to
want it, or be in need of it: (S:) in the dial. of
Temeem, أَشَأْتُهُ. (TA in art. شيأ.) It is said in a
prov., شَرٌّ مَا يُجِيْؤُكَ إِلَى مُخَّةِ عُرْقُوبٍ [It is an
evil thing that compels thee to have recourse to
the marrow of a hock]; for, as As says, the
عرقوب contains no marrow, and only he who
cannot obtain any [other] thing is made to want
it. (S.) And it is said in the Kur xix. 23,
فَأَجَآءَهَا المَخَاضُ إِلَى جِذْعِ النَّخْلَةِ And the motion
of the child in her womb compelled her to betake
herself to the trunk of the palm-tree. (Bd.)
جِيْئَةٌ [A coming;] a subst. from جَآءَ, (S, K,)
of the measure فِعْلَةٌ, with kesr to the ج. (S.)
جَئِئٌ and جَأّءٌ: see what next follows.
جَيَّآءٌ, (K,) mentioned by Sb as an extr. word,
(TA,) [but regularly formed, of the measure
فَعَّالٌ,] and ↓ جَأّءٌ, also written جَأَّاءٌ, (K,) with the
ى changed into hemzeh, (TA,) and ↓ جَئِئٌ, (K,)
[originally جَيِئٌ, of the measure فَعِلٌ, denoting
intensiveness, in the CK written جَايِئٌ,] mentioned by IJ as anomalous, A frequent comer.
(TA.) One says, إِنَّهُ لَجَيَّآءٌ بِخَيْرٍ Verily he is a
frequent bringer of good. (TA.)
[
جَآءٍ, originally جَايِئٌ, then جَائِئٌ, then جَائِىٌ,
and then جَآءٍ, Coming; act. part. n. of 1.]
