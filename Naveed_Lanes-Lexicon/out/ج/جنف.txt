جنف1
جَنَفٌ (T, S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.) and جُنُوفٌ,
(K,) the former being inf. n. of جَنِفَ and the
latter of جَنَفَ, (TA,) The act of inclining, or
declining (T, S, Mgh, K, TA) in speech and in
all affairs: (TA:) and declining, or deviating,
from the right course; acting wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or tyrannically; (T, Msb, *
K, TA;) like حَيْفٌ, which some erroneously
assert to be the act of a judge only. (T, TA.)
You say, جَنِفَ, (T, S, Mgh, Msb,) aor.
جَنَفَ, inf. n.
جَنَفٌ; (S, Msb;) [and app. جَنَفَ, aor.
جَنِفَ, inf. n.
جُنُوفٌ;] and ↓ اجنف; (T, Msb, TA;) He inclined or declined [in speech and in any affair]:
(T, S, TA:) and he declined, or deviated, from
the right course; acted wrongfully, unjustly,
injuriously, or tyrannically; (T, Mgh, Msb, TA;)

[ii. 178], فَمَنْ خَافَ مِنْ مُوصٍ جَنَفًا (S, TA,) i. e.
[And he who feareth, (or, as is said in the K in
art. خوف, knoweth,) from, or on the part of,

or a declining [from the right course]: (TA:)
or a manifest inclining or declining. (Er-Rághib,
TA.) You say, جَنِفَ فِى وَصِيَّتِهِ, aor.
جَنَفَ; [He
inclined, &c., in his testament;] and so ↓ اجنف.
(K.) And ↓ اجنف signifies He deviated from
that which was right. (K.) And فِى حُكْمِهِ ↓ اجنف
[He declined from the right course, or acted
wrongfully or unjustly, in his judgment]. (TA.)
Or ↓ اجنف relates peculiarly to the case of a
testament: and جَنِفَ signifies absolutely He
declined, or deviated, from that which was right.
(K.) And you say, جَنِفَ عَنْ طَرِيقِهِ, aor.
جَنَفَ;
and جَنَفَ, aor.

is of the former verb, (TA,) and جُنُوفٌ, (K, TA,)
which is of the latter verb; He turned away
from his course, or way; deviated therefrom.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Or [app. a mistake for “and ”] جَنَفٌ
signifies Depression (دُخُولٌ and اِنْهِضَامٌ) in one
of the two sides of the breast, or chest, (الزَّوْرِ,)
with evenness of the other side: (K:) the verb
is جَنِفَ: and the part. n. is ↓ جَنِفٌ and ↓ أَجْنَفُ,

اجنف He committed an act of inclining [to a
wrong course], or declining [from the right course,

see مَحْرُوقٌ.] ―
-b2-  تجانف عَنْ طَرِيقِهِ He affected
a declining, or deviating, from his course, or
way; he purposely declined, or deviated, therefrom; (K, * TA;) syn. تَمَايَلَ. (K.) And in
like manner, تجانف إِلَى الشَّىْءِ [He affected an

it]. (TA.) You say, تجانف لِإِثْمٍ He inclined
to a sin, (S, Mgh,) [or affected an inclining to
it, (see the part. n., below,)] intending, or purposing, the commission of an act of disobedience.
(Mgh.)
جَنَفَ is [an epithet] like دَنَفَ, applying to a
sing. and a pl., [being] also an inf. n. [of جَنِفَ,
q. v.]: Abu-l-'Iyál El-Hudhalee says,
أَلَّا دَرَأْتَ الخَصْمَ حِينَ رَأَيْتُهُمْ
جَنَفًا عَلَىَّ بِأَلْسُنٍ وَعُيُونِ
[Wherefore didst not thou repel the adversaries,
when thou sawest them inclining, or acting wrongfully, against me with tongues and eyes?]: or,
accord. to one reading, جُنُفًا [which is a pl. of
↓ جَانِفٌ]: (Skr p. 128:) [or, as some say,] جَنَفًا
is a pl. [or rather quasi-pl. n.] of ↓ جَانِفٌ, like
as رَوَحَ is of رَائِحٌ: or it may be for ذَوِي جَنَفٍ.
