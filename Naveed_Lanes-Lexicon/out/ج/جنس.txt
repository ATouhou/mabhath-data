جنس2
جنّسهُ بِهِ, (TK,) inf. n. تَجْنِيسٌ, from الجِنْسُ,
(S, K,) [He made it homogeneous, or congenial,
with it; or similar, or conformable, to it: expl.
in the TK, not well, by شاكله; but the inf. n.,
with tolerable correctness, by ايكى شيئى برى
برينه مشاكل قلمق. The usage of the term
تَجْنِيسٌ in rhetoric, to signify the use of two or
more words completely or partly conformable, is
post-classical, like جِنَاسٌ, an inf. n. of جَانَسَ.]

جانسهُ, [inf. n. مُجَانَسَةٌ and جِنَاسٌ,] It was,
or became, homogeneous, or congenial, with it; or
similar, or conformable, to it; syn. شَاكَلَهُ:
(Mgh, Msb:) المُجَانَسَةُ is from الجِنْسُ. (S, TA.)
You say, هٰذَا يُجَانِسُ هٰذَا This is homogeneous
with this; syn. يُشَاكِلُهُ: (Mgh, Msb:) so says
Kh. (Msb.) And كَيْفَ يُؤَانِسُكَ مَنْ لَا يُجَانِسُكَ
[How will he be sociable with thee who will not
be congenial with thee?]. (A.) And of a man
who has not discrimination nor intelligence, one
says, فُلَانٌ يُجَانِسُ البَهَائِمَ وَلَا يُجَانِسُ النَّاسَ [Such
a one resembles the beasts, and does not resemble
men]: (Mgh, Msb, * TA:) so says Kh. (Mgh.)
But As says that this usage, (Mgh, Msb,) in the
first and last of the above-mentioned phrases,
(Msb,) is post-classical. (Mgh, Msb.) The usage
of the term جِنَاسٌ by rhetoricians [to signify the
complete or partial conformity of two or more
words] is post-classical [like تَجْنِيسٌ]. (TA.)

تجانس الشَّيْآنِ [The two things were, or became homogeneous, congenial, similar, or conformable,] is a phrase of the scholastic theologians, not
[classical] Arabic. (TA.)
جِنْسٌ [A genus, kind, or generical class, comprising under it several species, or sorts; or
comprised under a superior genus, in relation to
which it is a species, or sort;] a ضَرةب of a thing;
(S;) or of anything; (Mgh, Msb;) any ضَرْب of
a thing; (A, K;) [as] of men, and of birds, and
of the definitions of grammar and of the art of
versification, and of things collectively; so accord.
to the lexicologists; (ISd, TA;) a term of more
common import than نَوْع [which is a species, or
sort]: (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K:) thus animal is a
جنس and man is a نوع, (Mgh, Msb,) because the
latter is of more particular import than the former,
though it is a جنس in relation to what is under
it; but the scholastic theologians reverse the
case, (Mgh,) for with them جنس is of more particular import than نوع: (Kull p. 139:) thus also
camels are a جنس of beasts: (A, K:) pl. أَجْنَاسٌ
[properly a pl. of pauc. but used also as one of
mult.] (Mgh, Msb, K) and جُنُوسٌ. (IDrd, K.)
You say, النَّاسُ أَجْنَاسٌ وَأَكْثَرُهُمْ أَنْجَاسٌ [Men are
of several kinds, and most of them are impure].
(A, TA.) And فُلَانٌ مِنْ جِنْسِكَ, meaning أَصْلِكَ
[i. e. Such a one is of thy stock]. (S in art. جنث.)
―
-b2-  [Hence, اِسْمُ جِنْسٍ A generic noun: and
اِسْمُ جِنْسٍ جَمْعِىٌّ a collective generic noun.] ―
-b3-
أَوْصَى لِجِنْسِهِ signifies He left by will, of his
property, to the children of his father, [or his
kindred by the father's side,] exclusively of all
relations of the mother: and so, لِأَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ.
(Mgh.) ―
-b4-  The assertion, in the K, that J's
saying, on the authority of IDrd, that As used
to say الجِنْسُ as meaning المُجَانَسَةُ is a vulgarism,
is erroneous, is a matter for consideration; for
As said not this, but [what has been cited above,
voce جَانَسَهُ, or] what will be found below, voce
مُجَانِسٌ. (TA.)
[
جِنْسِىٌّ Generic; generical.]
[
جِنْسِيَّةٌ Generical quality.]
[
مُجَانِسٌ Homogeneous; congenial; similar;
conformable; syn. مُشَاكِلٌ. (K.) But IDrd
asserts that As used to reject the saying of the
vulgar, هٰذَا مُجَانِسُ لِهٰذَا [This is homogeneous
with this, &c.], and to say, It is post-classical.
(S.) [See also 3.]
