an unimproving, state or condition (لَا زَالَ جَامِدَ
الحَالِ). (S, L.) جَمَادِ is [a proper name,] indecl.,
with kesr for its termination, because it is transformed from the inf. n., namely, الجُمُودُ, like
فَجَارِ, which means الفَجْرَةُ: (S:) and the contr.
of جَمَادِ لَهُ is جَمَادِ لَهُ, (S, * A,) which denotes
praise. (S.) El-Mutalemmis says,
جَمَادِ لَهَا وَلَا تَقُولِى
لَهَا أَبَدًا إِذَا ذُكِرَتْ حَمَادِ

tracts. (ISh, L, TA.)
جَمِيدُ العَيْنِ: see جَامِدٌ.
جُمَادَى One of the names of the months, (Msb,
K,) applied to two of the Arabian months, together called جُمَادَيَانِ, (TA,) and distinguished
by the appellations of جُمَادَى الأُولَى and جُمَادَى
الآخِرَةُ [the fifth and sixth months of the Arabian
year]: (S, K:) it is of the measure فُعَالَى, from
الجَمْدُ; (S;) the two months to which it is
applied being [said to be] so called because,
when the months were named, these two fell in
the season of the freezing of water: (ISd, L,
Msb:) [but this derivation seems to have been
invented when the two months thus named had
fallen back, into, or beyond, the winter; for
when they received this appellation, the former
of them evidently commenced in March, and the
latter ended in May; therefore I hold the opinion
of M. Caussin de Perceval, that they were thus
called because falling in a period when the earth
had become dry and hard by reason of paucity of
rain, from جَمَادٌ, an epithet applied to land upon
which rain has not fallen, or from جُمَادَى, an
epithet applied to an eye that sheds few tears;
which opinion is confirmed by the obvious derivations of the names of other months, صَفَرٌ and
رَبِيعٌ and رَمَضَانُ and شَوَّالٌ:] afterwards, when
the lunar months superseded the solar, the same
names were retained: (Msb:) [see زَمَنٌ, and
الهِجْرَةُ:] جمادى is determinate, (K,) being a
proper name, (TA,) and of the fem. gender:
(Msb, K:) if you find it masc., it is because it is
made to accord to الشَّهْرُ: all the other names of
the months are masc.: (Fr, IAmb, Msb:) the
pl. is جُمَادَيَاتٌ, (Fr, L, K,) agreeably with analogy; and if the form جِمَادٌ [a mistranscription
for جَمَائِدُ, like حَبَائِرُ, pl. of حُبَارَى,] were used,
it would also be agreeable with analogy. (Fr,
L.) The former of these two months is also
called جُمَادَى خَمْسَةٍ; and the latter, جُمَادَى سِتَّةٍ;
(K;) which mean, respectively, Jumádà the fifth
month and Jumádà the sixth month, from the
commencement of the year. (TA.) Lebeed says,
[describing a pair of wild asses,]
حَتَّى إِذَا سَلَخَا جُمَادَى سِتَّةً
جَزَآ فَطَالَ صِيَامُهُ وَصِيَامُهَا
[Until, when they both pass, and come to the end
of, Jumádà, completing six months, they satisfy
themselves with green pasture so as to be in no
need of water, and his and her abstinence from
water becomes of long continuance]: thus cited
by Bundár; ستّة being in the accus. case as a
denotative of state, and by جمادى being meant
جمادى الآخرة: or, accord. to IAar, the poet
said ستّةٍ, meaning the six months of winter,
which are the months of dew; and Aboo-'Amr
Esh-Sheybánee says the like. (MF.) AHn says
that the Arabs applied the name of جمادى to
The whole of the winter; [see above;] whether
the winter were at the same time as the months
so called or not: and Aboo-Sa'eed says the like.
(L.) ―
-b2-  See also جَامِدٌ.
لَيْلَةٌ جُمَادِيَّةٌ A wintry night. (Aboo-Sa'eed,
L.) [See جُمَادَى.]

it becomes motionless (يَجْمُدُ): (A, TA:) or a
sharp, cutting, sword. (AA, K.)
جَامِدٌ, applied to water, (Msb, K,) &c., (Msb,)
[i. e.] anything fluid, or liquid, (K,) In a state
of congelation, concretion, or solidity; freezing;
as also ↓ جَمْدٌ; contr. of ذَائِبٌ: (Msb, K:) you
say مَآءٌ جَمْدٌ [as well as مَآءٌ جَامِدٌ]: (Msb:) or
↓ جَمْدٌ signifies what is congealed, or frozen, of
water [&c.]; ice; (S, A;) contr. of ذَوْبٌ: (S:)
[see also جَمَدٌ:] it is originally an inf. n.: (S,
Msb, K:) [or it is an epithet from جَمُدَ, like
ضَخْمٌ from ضَخُمَ:] and ↓ جَمَدٌ is a pl. [or rather
a quasi-pl. n.] of جَامِدٌ, (S, Msb, K,) like as
خَدَمٌ is of خَادِمٌ: (S, Msb:) you say, قَدْ كَثُرَ
الجَمَدُ [The frozen waters have become many].
(S.) [Hence,] مُخَّةٌ جَامِدَةٌ A hard piece of
marrow. (L.) ―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  Remaining fixed, stationary,
or motionless. (Bd and Jel in xxvii. 90.) ―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  A
thing that does not grow, or increase; [incapable
of growth, or increase; inanimate;] as stone, in
contradistinction to a tree [and an animal]. (Kull.)
[See also جَمَادٌ.] You say, لَكَ جَامِدُ هٰذَا المَالِ
وَذَائِبُهُ (A, L, K *) (tropical:)  To thee belongs, or shall belong,
what consists of gold and silver [or the like inanimate things], of this property, and what consists of live stock, thereof: (L, K:) or what
consists of stones, thereof, and what consists of
trees, thereof: or what is solid, thereof, and
what is fluid, or liquid, thereof. (L.) ―
-b4-  [Hence
its application in lexicology and grammar to (assumed tropical:)  A
noun that is not an inf. n. nor derived from an
inf. n.; a noun having the quality of a real substantive (اِسْمِ عَيْنٍ), opposed to that which has
the quality of an ideal substantive (اِسْمُ مَعْنًى):
and (assumed tropical:)  a verb that has but one tense and no inf. n.,
as لَيْسَ and نِعْمَ &c., opposed (as is said in the
TA voce قَدْ) to مُتَصَرِّفٌ: it may be rendered (and
so I have rendered it), in these cases, aplastic.]

-b6-  (assumed tropical:)  Stupid,
dull, wanting in intelligence; inert; not sharp,

sheds no tears; (Ks, K;) as also ↓ جُمَادَى, (Ks,

جَامِدُ العَيْنِ, (A, K,) and العين ↓ جَمِيدُ, and
العين ↓ جَمَادُ, (A,) (tropical:)  A man whose eye sheds few
tears; (A;) or whose eye sheds no tears. (K.)
―

-b2-  The person who is entrusted with the
management of affairs in a game of chance (قِمَار
[here meaning the game called المَيْسِر]): (K:)
[i. q. ضَرِيبٌ:] or the person entrusted with the
management of affairs among a people or party,
(T, K, TA,) who does not take part in the game
called المَيْسِر, except that he shuffles the arrows
(يَضْرِبُ بِهَا) for the players, and has them placed
in his hands, and is confided in with respect to
them, and compels him who has incurred an
obligation to fulfil it: (L, TA:) or one who
takes no part in the game called المَيْسِر, (who is
called بَرَمٌ,) but who sometimes shuffles, or deals
forth, the arrows, (يُفِيضُ بِهَا,) for the players;
so in the following verse of Tarafeh:
وَأَصْفَرَ مَضْبُوحٍ نَظَرْتُ حَوِيرَهُ
عَلَى النَّارِ وَاسْتَوْدَعْتُهُ كَفَّ مُجْمِدِ
[And of many a yellow arrow, changed in colour
by fire, I have awaited the sound over the fire,
and I have deposited it in the hand of one taking
no part in the game but only shuffling, or dealing
forth, the arrows for the players]; meaning, I
have awaited its sound, which was like an answer
proceeding from it, when I straightened it and
marked it, over the fire: (S:) [or, accord. to the
EM (p. 105), where we find حِوَارَهُ in the place
of حَوِيرَهُ, the meaning is, and of many a yellow
arrow, &c., I have awaited the returning and
gaining, while we were assembled at the fire,
&c.:] or مجمد here means a man taking with
both his hands so as not to let anything go forth

(S, K: *) or one whose arrow does not gain anything in the game called المَيْسِر: (L:) or a person

that which is in his hand or possession, and not
to be deceived. (A 'Obeyd, TA.)
