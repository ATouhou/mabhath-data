جبتالجِبْتُ, not a pure Arabic word, because it comprises the letters ح and ت without any of the letters
of the kind called ذَوْلَقِىّ [which are ر and ل and
ن]; (S;) The idol: (S, K:) or idols: (Ksh
in iv. 54:) or the name of a certain idol, (Bd
and Jel on that verse,) belonging to Kureysh;
as also الطَّاغُوتُ: (Jel:) and that which is worshipped instead, or to the exclusion, of God;
whatever it be: (Ksh, Bd, K:) said to be originally الجِبْسُ, i. e., (Bd,) he, or that, wherein
is no good: (Bd, K:) and the diviner: (S, K:)
and the enchanter: (S, K, Kull:) and the like
thereof: (S:) or the Devil; Satan: (Kull:)
and enchantment. (Esh-Shaabee, K.) Accord.
to Esh-Shaabee, يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالجِبْتِ وَالطَّاغُوتِ, in
the Kur [iv. 54], means They believe in enchantment and the Devil: or, accord. to I' Ab, by
الجبت is meant Hoyeí Ibn-Akhtab; and by
الطاغوت, Kaab Ibn-El-Ashraf: (TA:) or the
words relate to these two men, Jews, who, in
order to induce Kureysh to join with them in a
league against Mohammad, prostrated themselves
to the gods of Kureysh: (Ksh, Bd:) or to
certain Jews, who said that the worship of idols is
more pleasing to God than that to which Mohammad invited. (Bd.) It is said in a trad. that
what are termed الطِّيَرَةُ and العِيَافَةُ and الطَّرْقُ
are مِنَ الجِبْتِ [app. meaning of things wherein
is no good: or kinds of divination: or from the
Devil]. (S.)
