places.
جَمَلٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.) and ↓ جَمْلٌ, (K,)
which latter is so rare that it is said by some to

(MF,) but it is a correct dial. var., (TA,) a word
of well-known meaning; (K;) i. e., [A he-camel;
but commonly applied to the camel as a generic
term; in like manner as جَامِلٌ is applied to the
males and the females; but properly,] the male
of the إِبِل; (TA;) the mate of the نَاقَة; (Fr, S,
Mgh;) among camels, corresponding to رَجُلٌ
among us; (Sh, Msb;) نَاقَةٌ corresponding to
مَرْأَةٌ, and بَكْرٌ to غُلَامٌ, and بَكْرَةٌ to جَارِيَةٌ; (Sh,

(Msb;) exceptionally to the female, as in the
saying شَرِبْتُ لَبَنَ جَمَلِى, (K,) i. e., I drank the
milk of my she-camel; but ISd doubts the correctness of this: (TA:) [as corresponding to

أَجْمَالٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) which may be pl. of
جَمْلٌ, (TA,) and أَجْمُلٌ (Msb) and [of mult.]
جِمَالٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and جُمْلٌ (K) and جِمَالَةٌ
(Mgh, Msb, K) and [quasi-pl. n.] جُمَالَةٌ and جَمَالَةٌ
and جَامِلٌ, (K,) which last is disallowed by some,
as will be seen below, (TA,) and [pl. pl.] جِمَالَاتٌ,
(S, Msb, K,) which is pl. of جِمَالٌ, (Msb, TA,)
or it may be pl. of جِمَالَةٌ, (TA,) and جُمَالَاتٌ
[which see also voce جُمَّلٌ] and جَمَالَاتٌ (K) and
جَمَائِلُ, (S, K,) pl. of جمالة and جِمال, (Ham
p. 527,) and أَجَامِلُ. (K.) One says of camels,
when they are males, without any female among
them, هٰذِهِ جِمَالَةُ بَنِى فُلَانٍ [These are the hecamels of the sons of such a one]. (ISk, S. [See
also جُمَالَةٌ.]) And they said also جِمَالَانِ [meaning Two herds of camels, thus forming a dual
from the pl. جِمَالٌ], like as they said لِقَاحَانِ.
(ISd, in TA voce خَيْلٌ.) It is said in a prov.,
مَااسْتَتَرَ مَنْ قَادَ الجَمَلَ [He does not conceal
himself who leads the he-camel]. (TA.) And in
another prov., اِتَّخَذَ اللَّيْلَ جَمَلًا (assumed tropical:)  He journeyed
all the night. (K, TA. [See also Freytag's Arab.
Prov. i. 230.]) ―

cubits in length: (K:) or, as some say, جَمَلُ
البَحْرِ is the name of a very great fish, also called
the بَال, [i. e., the whale,] thirty cubits in length:
accord. to some, this, (TA,) or جَمَلُ المَآءِ, (Mgh,)
is what is called the كَوْسَج and كُبَع (Mgh, TA)
and لُخْم, [i. e., xiphias, or sword-fish,] which
passes by nothing without cutting it. (TA.) [In
the present day, جَمَلُ البَحْرِ is an appellation of
The pelican.] ―
-b3-  عَيْنُ الجَمَلِ, in the dial. of
Egypt, i. q. الشَّاه بَلُّوط [The chestnut]. (TA.) ―
-b4-
جَمَلٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  A woman's husband. (L in
arts. اخذ and قيد. See 2 in each of those arts.)
―
-b5-  Also (tropical:)  Palm-trees; (K;) as being likened to
the he-camel in respect of their tallness and their
bigness and their produce: in some of the copies
of the K, النَّحْلُ is erroneously put for النَّخْلُ.
(TA.) ―
-b6-  See also جُمَّلٌ.

(TA, in two places in this art.) ―
-b2-  Hence, app.,
(TA,) The aggregate of a thing; (K;) the sum,
whole, or total; (KL, PS;) it implies muchness,
or numerousness, and means any aggregate unseparated: (Er-Rághib, TA:) pl. جُمَلٌ. (S.)
[جُمْلَةٌ مِنْ مَالٍ generally means A large sum of
money; and in a similar sense جُمْلَةٌ is often used
in relation to various things.] It is said in the
Kur [xxv. 34], وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَوْ لَا نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ
الْقُرْآنُ جُمْلَةً وَاحِدَةً, i. e., [And those who disbelieved said, Wherefore was not the Kur-án sent
down, or revealed, to him] aggregated? (TA:)
[or in one aggregate?] or at once? (Bd.) [Hence,
بِالجُمْلَةِ as meaning Upon the whole; to sum up.]
―
-b3-  And hence, in grammar, (TA,) [A proposition; a clause; a phrase; sometimes, a sentence;]
a phrase composed of a subject and an attribute,
[i. e., composed of an inchoative and an enunciative, (in which case it is termed جُمْلَةٌ اسْمِيَّةٌ,) or
of a verb and its agent, (in which case it is termed
جُمْلَةٌ فِعْلِيَّةٌ,)] (KT, TA,) [&c.,] whether affording
a complete sense, as زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ [Zeyd is standing],
or not, as إِنْ يُكْرِمْنِى [If he treat me with honour].
(KT.)
جَمْلَآءُ: see جَمِيلٌ.
جَمَلُونَ A building, or structure, in the form
of a camel's hump: (TA:) [a ridged roof: so in

beauty: (Sb, Msb:) or much goodness, or beauty
or goodliness or comeliness, in the mind, or in the

much goodness that is communicated from its
possessor to another: (Er-Rághib, TA:) accord.
to As, [when relating to the person,] حُسْنٌ is in
the eyes; and جَمَالٌ, in the nose. (TA in art.
حسن.) [See also جَمِيلٌ.] One says, جَمَالَكَ أَنْ
لَا تَفْعَلَ كَذَا, (ISd, K,) or أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا, (IDrd,
TA,) meaning, Keep to that which is most comely
for thee to do, and do not thus. (IDrd, ISd, K.
[But see what follows.]) ―
-b2-  Also Patience. (Mgh

جَمَالَكَ أَيُّهَا القَلْبُ القَرِيحُ
سَتَلْقَى مَنْ تُحِبُّ فَتَسْتَرِيحُ
(S, * TA, the former of which cites only the first
hemistich, and the latter substitutes الجَرِيحُ for
its syn. القَرِيحُ,) meaning, [Keep thy patience, O
thou wounded heart: thou wilt find whom thou
lovest, and be at rest: or] keep to thy patience,
or thy constraint of thyself to be patient, and thy
shrinking from what is foul, and be not impatient
in an evil manner. (S, TA.)

-b3-  A person, (K,) or woman, (M,) who melts

or fat that is melted and collected: (K, TA:) or
fat that is melted, and, whenever it drips, made
to drip upon bread, and then replaced over the
fire [that it may drip again: see جَمَلَ]: (TA:)
and ↓ جُمَالَةٌ, also, signifies [the same; or] melted
grease. (Mgh, * TA.) [See also جَمُولٌ.]
-A2-  Hence,
accord. to Abu-l-'Alà, because, when a man becomes fat and in good condition, his جَمَال becomes
apparent, (Ham p. 155,) as also ↓ جُمَالٌ and ↓ جُمَّالٌ,
(K,) or this last denotes a higher degree of beauty
than جَمِيلٌ, (S, Sgh,) and has no broken pl.,

measure] فَعْلَآءُ having no [masc. of the measure]
أَفْعَلُ; (TA;) [but see above;] or this is applied to
any female as signifying perfect, or complete, in
body. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.) It is said in a trad., إِنَّ اللّٰهَ
جَمِيلٌ يُحِبُّ الجِمَالَ Verily God is comely in
deeds, (TA,) or an Abundant Bestower of good
things: He loveth those who are of the like character. (Er-Rághib, TA.) And you say, عَامَلَهُ
بَالجَمِيلِ [He treated him with comely, or pleasing,
behaviour]. (TA.) And مَاسَحَهُ بِالجَمِيل [He
coaxed him, or wheedled him, with comely, or
pleasing, behaviour or speech]. (ISd, K. [See 3.])
―
-b2-  أَبُو جَمِيلٍ [The kind of plants called] البَقْل;
because they embellish by their presence, and
render good, the seasoning of food; or because
they take away the جَمِيل, i. e., the grease of the
flesh-meat, and dry up the food. (Har p. 227.)
جَمَالَةٌ: see the next paragraph.
جُمَالَةَ: see جُمَّلٌ:
-A2-  and جَمِيلٌ.
-A3-  Also A
herd, or distinct number, of camels; (K;) mentioned before as a pl. of جَمَلٌ [q. v.]: (TA:) or,
of she-camels among which is no he-camel; as
also ↓ جِمَالَةٌ and ↓ جَمَالَةٌ; (K;) but this is contradictory to a saying of ISk [respecting جِمَالَةٌ],
mentioned above [voce جَمَلٌ; where all these
three words are said to be pls. of جَمَلٌ]: (TA:)
and also horses: pl. ↓ جُمَالٌ, which is extr. [as a
pl.; though, in relation to جُمَالَةٌ, it may be a
coll. gen. n., forming its n. un. with ة]. (AA, K.)
جِمَالَةٌ: see what next precedes.
جَمِيلَةٌ A number of gazelles together: and of
pigeons. (Ibn-' Abbád, K.)

rope of a ship, (S, K,) i. e., the thick rope thereof,
(TA,) that is also called قَلْسٌ, (S, TA,) consisting
of [a number of] ropes put together: (S:) and
↓ جُمَالَةٌ also signifies [the same; or] a thick rope,
because consisting of many strands put together;
pl. جُمَالَاتٌ; (Zj, TA;) which Mujáhid explains
as meaning the ropes of bridges; but I 'Ab, as
the ropes of ships, put together so as to be like
the waists of men [in thickness]. (TA.) In all
the forms mentioned above, except the last (جمالة),
the word is read in the phrase [in the Kur vii. 38],
حَتَّى يَلِجَ الجُمَّلُ فِى سَمِّ الخِيَاطِ [Until the cable
shall enter into the eye of the needle]: (K, TA:)
I 'Ab reads الجُمَّلُ, (S, TA,) and so do 'Alee and
many others: ↓ جُمْلٌ is pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]
of جُمْلَةٌ, a strand of a thick rope; or, accord. to
IJ, pl. of جَمَلٌ [q. v.]: the first is explained by
Fr as meaning ropes put together; but Aboo-Tálib thinks that he meant ↓ جُمَلٌ, without tesh-deed. (TA.)
-A2-  حِسَابُ الجُمَّلِ, (S K,) thought
by IDrd to be not Arabic, (TA,) and ↓ الجُمَلِ,
(K,) but IDrd doubts its correctness, The calculation by means of the letters د ج ب ا, &c. (TA.)
جَمَّالٌ An owner, or an attendant, of a camel
or camels: (KL, TA: * [see also جامِلٌ:]) and
جَمَّالَةٌ owners, or attendants, of camels; (S, K,
TA;) similar to خَيَّالَةٌ and حَمَّارَةٌ; (S, TA;) as
the former is to حَمَّارٌ. (TA.) [See an ex. of the
latter in a verse cited voce إِذَا.]
جُمَّالٌ: see جَمِيلٌ.
جَامِلٌ [act. part. n. of جَمَلَ.
-A2-  And also part. n.
of جَمُلَ]. The Arabs say, اُجْمُلْ إِنْ كُنْتَ جَامِلًا
[Become beautiful, &c., if thou be becoming beautiful, &c.]: but when they mean the quality
[alone], they say, إِنَّهُ لَجَمِيلٌ [Verily he is beautiful, &c.]. (Lh, TA.)
-A3-  A man possessing a
جَمَل [or he-camel]. (TA. [See also جَمَّالٌ.]) ―

and their owners: (S, K, TA: [also said in the

erroneously put for الجَامِلُ:]) or a word formed to
denote a pl., meaning camels, (Ham pp. 122 and
490,) males and females; (Id p. 122;) derived
from جَمَلٌ; (Id. p. 490;) like بَاقِرٌ (Id. ib. and

كَلْبٌ]. (TA.) ―

-b2-  Also] One
who is unable to answer a question put to him by
another person, and therefore neglects it, and
bears malice against him for some time. (TA.)
