(K,) or hit, (Msb,) or struck him on, (Ham ubi

inf. n. as above, (TA,) (tropical:)  He turned him back (K,
TA) from the thing that he wanted: (TA:) or
(tropical:)  he met him, or encountered him, with, or he said

(JK, M, TA:) or (tropical:)  he encountered him with that

تَجْبِيهٌ The mounting a fornicator, or an
adulterer, upon an ass, and turning his face
towards the tail; whence the trad. of the Jews
respecting the adulterer, يُحُمَّمُ وَيُجَبَّهُ ويُجْلَدُ
[He shall have his face blackened with charcoal,
and be mounted on an ass with his face towards
the tail, and be flogged]: (Mgh:) or the mounting
two fornicators, or adulterers, upon an ass, and
turning the backs of their heads towards each
other, (JK, Mgh,) and parading them round
about; thus accord. to the Tekmileh: (Mgh:)
or the blackening [with charcoal] the faces of two
fornicators, or adulterers, (أَنْ يُحَمَّرَ in the K
being a mistake for أَنْ يُحُمَّمَ, i. e. يُسَوَّدَ, TA,)
and mounting them upon a camel or an ass, and
turning their faces in contrary directions: accord.
to analogy, it should mean turning their faces
towards each other; for it is from الجَبْتَةُ: تَجْبِيهٌ
also signifies the bending, inclining, lowering, or
hanging down, the head towards the ground: and
it may be hence; (i. e. it may be hence that it is
applied to him who is mounted on a beast in the
manner described above; TA;) because he to
whom this is done bends down his head in shame
and confusion: or it may be from جَبَهَهُ meaning
"he did to him a thing disliked, or hated." (K.)
8
اِجْتِبَاهٌ The deeming [one] rude, coarse, unkind, hard, or churlish. (JK.) ―
-b2-  And The fearing [a person or thing]. (JK.) ―

(M, K.)
جَبْهَةٌ [The forehead;] the part of the face
which is the place of prostration: (As, Msb, K:)
or the even part that is between the eyebrows and
the نَاصِيَة [or place where the hair grows in the
fore part of the head]: (Kh, JK, Msb, K:) so
of a man, (S, Msb,) and of others: (S:) [or,] of
a horse, the part that is below the ears and above
the eyes: (TA:) pl. جِبَاهٌ. (Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
الجَبْهَةُ (assumed tropical:)  A certain Mansion of the Moon; [the
Tenth Mansion;] (S, K, Kzw;) consisting of
four stars; (S;) the four stars [ζ, γ, η, and α,]
in the neck and heart of Leo; [regarded by the
Arabs as the fore-part, or forehead, of Leo;]
(Kzw in his descr. of Leo;) between each of
which and the next to it is the space of a whip's
length; the northernmost of them called by astrologers الأَسَدُ. (Kzw in his descr. of the Mansions
of the Moon.) ―
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The moon (K, TA)
itself: but [it rather seems to mean the upper
part of the disc of the moon; for] it is said in
the M that a certain unknown poet has metaphorically assigned a جبهة to the moon. (TA.)
―
-b4-  Also جَبْهَةٌ, (tropical:)  The chief of a people, or company of men; (JK, Mgh, K, TA;) like as one

generous and manly, or manly and noble, persons
of a people, or company of men: or men exerting
themselves in the case of a bloodwit or a debt or
other obligation, (K, TA,) or in repairing the
condition of a poor man, (TA,) and who come
not to any one but he is ashamed to turn them
back, (K, TA,) or who are seldom or never
turned back by anyone: so, accord. to Aboo-Sa'eed, in a trad. in which it is said that there
shall be no poor-rate in the case of the جبهة.
(TA.) ―
-b6-  (tropical:)  A company, or collected number, of
men, (JK, S, Msb,) and of horses: (JK, Msb:)
or, of horses, the best: (TA:) and [simply]
horses; (Lth, S, M, Mgh, K;) a word having no
sing., or n. un.: (M, K:) accord. to Lth, (TA,)
having this last meaning in the trad. above mentioned; (S, Mgh, TA;) because horses are the
best of beasts. (Mgh.)
-A2-  (tropical:)  Abjectness, or ignominy; (JK, M, K, TA;) and a state of annoyance, or molestation: (Z, TA:) thought by ISd
to be from جَبَهَهُ meaning “ he encountered him
with that which he disliked or hated,” or “ he
accused him thereof to his face; ” because the
doing this causes one to experience abjectness, or
ignominy. (TA.) It is said to have this meaning
in a trad., in which it is said, فَإِنَّ اللّٰهَ قَدْ أَرَاحَكُمْ
مِنَ الجَبْهَةِ والسَّجَّةِ والبَجَّةِ, i. e. For God hath
relieved you from abjectness, or ignominy, &c.,
and milk diluted with water, and blood drawn
from a vein [of a camel], which the Arabs used
to eat: or in this trad., (TA,) الجَبْتَهَةُ is the name

السجّة and البجّة were two idols. (S and K in
art. سج.)
وَرَدْنَا مَآءً لَهُ جَبِيهَةٌ We came to a water that
was salt, so that the drinking thereof did not
take away the thirst of our cattle: (ISk, JK, S:)
or that was altered for the worse in taste and
colour, from some such cause as long standing,
though still drinkable; or covered with the green
substance called طُحْلُب and with leaves: or that
was deep in the bottom, difficult to give to drink.

man. (TA.)
جَابِهٌ, applied to a gazelle, (JK,) or to a bird

width of his جَبْهَة. (TA.)
جبو and جبى
[The words belonging to the former of these
two arts. cannot well be classed by themselves,
being intimately connected with those of the latter,
which are the more numerous and common, and
from which they are generally easily distinguishable.]
1
جَبَى, (K,) first pers. جَبَيْتُ, (Ks, S, Er-Rághib,) aor.
1َ2ِ3َ; (K;) and جَبَى, aor.
1َ2َ3َ, (K,)
said by MF to be unknown, and also, because
neither the second nor the third radical is a faucial
letter, unreasonable, but mentioned by Sb, though
held by him to be of weak authority, and mentioned also by IAar, as extr., like أَبَى, aor. يَأْبَى;
(TA;) and جَبَا, (TA,) first pers. جَبَوْتُ, (Ks, S,
TA,) aor.
1َ2ُ3َ; (TA;) inf. n. [of the first and
second] جَبْىٌ (Sh, K) and [probably of the last
only] جَبًا and جِبًا and جُبًا and [of the last, but
whether in the first or the second of the senses
here following is not shown,] جِبْوَةٌ; (K; [or this
last has a different application, explained below;])
He collected water in a trough or tank for beasts
&c. [Ks, S, K, Er-Rághib.) ―
-b2-  And (hence,
metaphorically, Er-Rághib, TA) the first of these
verbs, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, Er-Rághib,) and the
second, (K,) and the third; (S, Msb, TA;) inf. n.
(of the first, S, Msb) جِبَايَةٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, Er-Rághib) and (of the last, S, Msb) جِبَاوَةٌ (S, Msb,
K) and جَبْوٌ (TA) [and probably جِبْوَةٌ also, which
see above]; (tropical:)  He collected the [tax called] خَرَاج,
(S, Mgh, Msb, K, Er-Rághib,) and [other] property. (Msb, TA.) The last of these verbs is
said in the S to be originally with ء, though pronounced without ء; but IB says that this is not
the case, and that it has not been heard with ء.
(TA.) You say also, جَبَاهُ القَوْمَ (assumed tropical:)  [He collected
it from the people, or company of men]; (M, K, *
TA;) and جَبَى مِنْهُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [He collected from them].
(M, K, TA.) ―
-b3-  Also جَبَا [or جَبَى], (TA,) first pers.
جَبَيْتُ, (Zj, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He appropriated a thing
purely to himself, exclusively of any partner;
chose it, or took it in preference, for himself.
(Zj, TA.) And hence, (Zj, TA,) ↓ اجتباهُ (assumed tropical:)  He
chose it, or selected it, (Zj, S, K) لِنَفْسِهِ for himself. (TA.)
-A2-  And جَبَى and جَبَا, [originally
جَبَأَ,] He returned, receded, retreated, or went
back. (TA.)
2
جبّى, inf. n. تَجْبِيَةٌ, He placed his hands
upon his knees, (K, TA,) in prayer; (TA;) or
upon the ground: or he fell prostrate; or fell
upon his face: (K:) or he lowered his body and
his hands, and raised his buttocks: (Ham p. 801:)
[or] تجبية signifies a man's standing [with the
hands upon the knees] in the manner of the رَاكِع:
(S, K: *) accord. to A'Obeyd, what is thus termed
is of two kinds: one is the placing the hands
upon the knees, while standing: the other, the
prostrating oneself, or falling upon the face, lying
down; which is سُجُودٌ: (S:) or the bending
down, and placing the hands upon the knees;
because it is a bringing-together of the limbs.
(Mgh.)
-A2-  جبّاهُ, inf. n. as above, meaning He
gave to him, is vulgar. (TA.)
4
اجبى in the trad. مَنْ أَجْبَى فَقَدْ أَرْبَى is
originally أَجْبَأَ [q. v.]: (S:) accord. to IAth,
it is a corruption of the relater, or the ء is suppressed to assimilate the verb to اربى (TA.)
The inf. n., إِجْبَآءٌ, is variously explained, as
follows: (TA:) The selling seed-produce before
it shows itself to be in a good state: (A'Obeyd,
Th, S, K:) and a man's hiding his camels from
the collector of the poor-rate: (IAar, A'Obeyd,
K:) and i. q. عِينَةٌ; i. e. the selling to a man
a commodity for a certain price to be paid at
a certain period, then buying it of him with
ready money for a less price than that for which
it was sold. (TA.)

―
-b3-  See also 1, last sentence but one. ―
-b4-  Also
(assumed tropical:)  God's particular, or peculiar, distinguishing of
men by abundant bounty, from which various
blessings result to them without their labour; as
happens to prophets and some others. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―
-b5-  Also اجتباهُ, (assumed tropical:)  He forged it:
and he extemporized it. (TA.) Hence, in the
Kur [vii. 202], قَالُوا لَوْلَا اجْتَبَيْتَهَا (assumed tropical:)  They say,
Wherefore hast thou not forged it, (Fr, TA,) or
produced it, (Th, TA,) or invented it, (Jel,) or
put it together by forgery, (Bd,) of thyself?
(Fr, Th, Bd, Jel, TA:) or wherefore hast thou
not sought it, or demanded it, of God? (Bd.)
جَبًا, or جَبًى, (as in different copies of the K,)
written with ا and with ى, (TA,) The camel-waterer's going in advance of the camels a day
before their coming to the water, and collecting
for them water in the drinking-trough, and then
bringing them to it (IAar, K, TA) on the morrow.
(IAar, TA.) [App. an inf. n., of which, in this
sense, the verb is not mentioned.] So in the
verse,
بِالرَّيْثِ مَا أَرْوَيْتُهَا لَا بِالعَجَلْ

[Slowly I satisfied their thirst; not hastily: and
by going in advance of them a day, and collecting
for them water in the trough, and bringing them
to it on the morrow, I satisfied their thirst; not
by pouring the water into the trough while they
were drinking, without having prepared any for
them beforehand]. (IAar, TA.)
-A2-  Also the former,
Water collected [in a trough]; and so ↓ جُبْوَةٌ,
with damm. (TA. [See جِبًا.]) ―

(TA:) or the station of the drawer of water,

omitted in the CK,) and ↓ جِبَآءَةٌ: (TA as from
the K, but not in the CK: [perhaps a mistranscription for ↓ جِبَايَةٌ:]) but accord. to IAmb, جِبًا
is pl. of ↓ جِبْيَةٌ. (TA.)
جَبْوَةٌ; see جِبًا.
جُبْوَةٌ: see جَبًا and جِبًا.
جِبْوَةٌ: see جِبًا.
