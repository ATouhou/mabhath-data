-b2-  I. q. جَثًا [He sat
upon his knees; &c.]; (AA, Fr, S, K;) as also
↓ اِجْذَوَى, [in form] like اِرْعَوَى; (TA;) except
that جذا is more indicative of keeping to a place:
(Kh, TA:) or he stood upon the extremities of
his toes: (As, K:) accord. to Th, جُذُوٌّ is [the
standing] upon the extremities of the toes; and
جُثُوٌّ is [the sitting] upon the knees: (TA:) and
accord. to IAar, ↓ جَاذٍ means [a man standing]
upon his feet; and جَاثٍ, [one sitting] upon his
knees. (S, TA.) Accord. to El-Hasan Ibn-'AbdAllah El-Kátib El-Isbahánee, جَذَا, inf. n. جُذُوٌّ,
said of a bird, means He stood upon the extremities of his toes, and warbled, and went round
in his warbling; which he does only when seeking the female: and said of a horse, it means he
stood upon his toes; and in like manner when
said of a man, whether for dancing or for some
other purpose. (TA.) A poet says, (S,) namely,
En-Noamán Ibn-Nadleh, (TA,)
إِذَا شِئْتُ غَنَّتْنِى دَهَاقِينُ قَرْيَةٍ
وَصَنَّاجَةٌ تَجْذُو عَلَى حَرْفِ مَنْسِمِ
[When I will, the husbandmen of a village sing

in order to prove their strength, and vie, one
with another, in lifting it, for that purpose].

i. e. a thick piece of wood, having fire at the end
of it or not: (AO, S, in explanation of the first:)
or a thick piece of fire-wood, not flaming: (AO,
TA, in explanation of جِذْوَةٌ مِنَ النَّارِ:) or a thick
stick, one end of which is a live coal: (Aboo-Sa'eed, TA:) or a thick stick upon which fire is
taken [by kindling one end]: (ISk, TA:) and
a piece (قَبْسَةٌ, K, or قِطْعَةٌ, Har p. 471) of fire:
(K, Har:) or a portion of fire-wood that remains
after flaming: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and a live
coal: (S, K:) or a flaming live coal: (Msb:)
or جِذْوَةٌ مِنَ النَّارِ means a piece of live coal; so
in the language of all the Arabs: (Mujáhid, S,
TA:) pl. [of the first] جِذًى and [of the second]
جُذًى (S, Msb, K) and (of the third, TA) جَذًى
(Msb, TA, and so in a copy of the S) and جِذَآءٌ,
(AAF, K,) which is held by ISd to be a pl. of
the third. (TA.)
جُذَآءٌ: see جُدَآءٌ, in art. جدى.
جَاذٍ [part. n. of 1; fem. جَاذِيَةٌ: pl. masc.
جِذَآءٌ; pl. fem. جَاذِيَاتٌ and جَوَاذٍ]. A rájiz says,
(S,) namely, 'Amr Ibn-Jebel-El-Asadee, (TA,)
لَمْ يُبْقِ مِنْهَا سَبَلُ الرَّذَاذِ
غَيْرَ أَثَافِى مِرْجَلٍ جَوَاذِى
i. e. [The continual fine rain left not thereof save
the three stones that were the supports of a cooking-pot] remaining firm. (S, TA.) ―

[Sitting upon his knees; &c.]: (Fr, TA:) or
sitting upon his heels, with his feet upright, [resting] upon the extremities of his toes: (S:) or
standing upon the extremities of the toes: (AA,
S:) see also 1: pl. [masc.] جَذَآءٌ. (S) Aboo-Duwád describes mares as جَاذِيَاتٌ عَلَى السَّنَابِكِ,

-b3-
جَوَاذٍ, (K,) applied to she-camels, (TA,) means
That bear themselves erect (↓ تَجْذُو) in their
course, or pace, as though they lifted their feet
clear from the ground; (K, TA;) on the authority of Aboo-Leylà: (TA:) [the last words of
the explanation in the K are كَأَنَّهَا تَقْلَعُ: in the
TA, كانها تقلع السَّيْرَ: I suppose that السَّيْرَ is for
فِى السَّيْرِ; and that the pret. of the aor. here used
is قَلِعَ; for قَلِعٌ, which is of the regular form of
a part. n. of such a verb as قَلِعَ, means “ raising
the feet clear from the ground in walking &c.: ”
but in one copy of the K, I find تُقَلّعُ: and another
reading in some work seems to be تُقْلِعُ; for]
ISd says, I know not جَذَا with the meaning of
أَسْرَعَ nor of أَقْلَعَ: and As says that جَوَاذٍ means
quick, or swift, camels, that do not stretch themselves forth in their course, or pace, but bear
themselves erect (وَيَنْتَصِبْنَ ↓ يَجْذُونَ). (TA.)
مُجْذٍ [act. part. n. of 4]. مِثْلُ الأَرْزَةِ المُجْذِيَةِ
عَلَى الأَرْضِ, (S,) or كَالأَرْزَةِ المجذية على وَجْهِ
الارض, (TA,) occurring in a trad., (S, TA,) describing the unbeliever, (TA,) means [Like the
pine-tree] that is firm (S, TA) and erect [upon
the ground]. (TA.)
مُجْذَوْذٍ [in the CK, erroneously, المَجْذُوْذِىُّ,]
Keeping constantly to the dwelling, or to the
camel's saddle and the dwelling, (الرَّحْل and
المَنْزِل, AA, S, K,) not quitting it: (AA, S:) like
مُجْذَوْذٍ عَلَى الرَّحْلِ. (AA, S) ―
-b2-  And A man
who lowers, or abases, himself; (El-Hejeree, ISd,
TA;) as though he clave to the ground by reason
of his abjectness; from جَذَا القُرَادُ فِى جَنْبِ البَعِيرِ
[q. v.]. (ISd, TA.)
