One says, الشَّمْسُ ↓ تجلّت The sun became unobscured, or exposed to view, and ceased to be
eclipsed. (TA from a trad.) Er-Rághib says that
↓ وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا تَجَلَّى is sometimes by the thing itself; as in
the phrase [in the Kur xcii. 2], فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّى رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ
[By the day when it becometh clear, &c.]: and
sometimes, by the case, and the action; as in the
saying [in the Kur vii. 139], فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّى رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ
[And when his Lord became manifested to the
mountain]: Zj says that the meaning in this
instance is, appeared, and so say the Sunnees;

&c.; and he who rises to eminences, or who is
accustomed to embark in, or surmount, lofty and
difficult things: when I put down the turban, ye

this case is a verb in the pret. tense: 'Eesà Ibn-
'Omar says that when a man is named قَتَلَ or ضَرَبَ
or the like, the word is imperfectly decl.; and he
adduces, in evidence, this verse: others say that
جلا may be here without tenween because it is
imitative of a phrase, as though the poet said,
أَنَا ابْنُ الَّذِى يُقَالُ لَهُ جَلَا الأُمُورِ: (S, TA:) accord.
to IB, it is without tenween because it is a verb
with its agent [implied in it]. (TA.) ―

to some, it signifies (assumed tropical:)  The daybreak, or dawn;

يَمِينٌ أَوْ نِفَارٌ أَوْ جَلَآءٌ
[For verily the means of deciding the truth are
three: an oath, and incongruity of circumstances,
and acknowledgment, or confession]: (S:) but
Az writes the last word ↓ جِلَآء, with kesr to the
ج, as meaning an evidence, or a proof, and witnesses; from مُجَالَاةٌ [inf. n. of 3, q. v.]. (TA.)
―
-b3-  أَقَمْتُ عِنْدَهُ جَلَآءَيَوْمِى, (K, TA,) or جَلَآءَ يَوْمٍ,

him, or at his abode,] during the whiteness of my,
or a, day. (Zj, K, TA.)
-A2-  See also the next
paragraph.
جِلَآءٌ: see the paragraph next preceding.
-A2-  Also,
(S, Mgh, K,) written by El-Muhellebee ↓ جَلَآءٌ,

first, (Mgh,) or it is allowable, as also ↓ جِلًا, the
former of the last two mentioned on the authority
of En-Nahhás, (TA,) Collyrium: (S, K:) or a
particular kind thereof, (K, TA,) that clears the
sight; (TA;) [i. e.] i. q. إِثْمِدٌ [antimony, or an
ore of antimony]; (Mgh, TA;) so called because
it clears the sight. (Mgh.)
-A3-  مَاجِلَاؤُهُ What is
his honourable name, or surname, (S,) or his good
surname, (K,) by which he is addressed? (S, K.)
جَلِىٌّ Clear, unobscured, exposed to view, displayed, laid open, disclosed, or uncovered: apparent, or plainly apparent, overt, conspicuous,
manifest, notorious, plain, obvious, or evident:
(S, Msb, K, TA:) جَالٍ thus used has not been

جَالٍ Going forth, or emigrating, from his
country, or town: [like جَالٌّ:] and so جَالِيَةٌ,
applied to a company of people; [as also جَالَّةٌ;]
(Msb;) or to people who have gone forth, or
emigrated, from their homes; (S;) and particularly to those tributaries, (Mgh, Msb,) namely,
certain Jews, (Mgh,) whom 'Omar expelled from
the country of the Arabs; (Mgh, Msb;) and
afterwards, to such as have the poll-tax imposed
upon them, of the people of the Bible, and of the
Magians, though not having emigrated from their
homes; (Mgh;) [i. e.] the free non-Muslim subjects of a Muslim government; because they were
expelled by 'Omar from Arabia; (K;) the word
being fem. because denoting a جَمَاعَة; (Mgh;)
and its pl. is جَوَالٍ. (Mgh, Msb.) ―
-b2-  Hence,
(Msb,) ↓ جَالِيَةٌ [as a subst.] is applied to The
poll-tax that is exacted from the persons last
mentioned above; (S, Mgh, Msb;) as also جَالَّةٌ:
(S:) first, in this sense, applied to that which
was exacted from the people expelled from Arabia
by 'Omar. (Msb.) You say, اُسْتُعْمِلَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى
الجَالِيَةِ [Such a one was employed as collector of
the poll-tax]. (S, Mgh, Msb.)
