behind him; or shrank from him; or shrank
from him and hid myself: and he cites (from
Nuseyb Ibn-Mihjen, TA)
فَهَلْ أَنَ إِلَّ مِثْلُ سَيِّقَةِ العِدَى
إِنِ اسْتَقْدَمَتْ نَحْرٌ وَإِنْ جَبَأَتْ عَقْرٌ

away by the enemy? If they go before, slaughter
befalls them; and if they remain behind, hocking].

not draw back from reviling me; did not desist,

مَنْ أَجْبَى فَقَدْ أَرْبَى [He who sells seed-produce
before it shows itself to be in a good state, or
before it has come to maturity, practices the like
of usury]: (S, TA:) originally with ء, (S,) which

of ↓ جَبْأَةٌ, which is a coll. gen. n., like كَمْأَةٌ:
(MF and TA, voce قَعْبٌ:) [J says,] جِبَأَةٌ signifies
Red كَمْأَة [or truffles]: or, accord. to El-Ahmar,
those [truffles] that incline to redness; كَمْأَةٌ signifying those that incline to dust-colour and
blackness; and فِقَعَةٌ, the white; and بَنَاتُ أَوْبَرَ,
the small: (S:) accord. to AHn, ↓ جَبْأَةٌ signifies
a white thing resembling a كَمْء, of which no use
is made: but accord. to IAar, the black كَمْأَة;
which, he says, are the best of كمأة: (TA:) the
pl. of جَبْءٌ is أَجْبُؤٌ, (S, K,) a pl. of pauc., (S,)
and جِبَأَةٌ, [as mentioned above,] or, accord. to
Sb, this is a quasi-pl. n., (TA,) and ↓ جَبَأٌ, (K,)

جأب.)
جُبَّأٌ (S, K) and ↓ جُبَّاءٌ? (Sb, K) Fearful, or
cowardly: (S, K:) fem. with ة: and therefore
the pl. is formed by the addition of و and ن.

says,
فَمَا أَنَ مِنْ رَيْبِ المَنُونِ بِجُبَّأٍ
وَلَا أَنَا مِنْ سَيْبِ الإِلٰهِ بِآيِسِ
