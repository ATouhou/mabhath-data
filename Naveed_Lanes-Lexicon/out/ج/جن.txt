signifies he, or it, made, or prepared, for him, or
gave him, that which should veil him, conceal
him, &c. : accord. to Er-Rághib, the primary
signification of جَنٌّ is the veiling, or concealing,
&c., from the sense. (TA.) And جُنَّ عَنْهُ means
It (anything) was veiled, concealed, or hidden,
from him. (K.) ―
-b2-  He concealed it; namely, a
dead body; as also ↓ اجنّهُ: (S, TA:) or the
latter, he wrapped it in grave-clothing: (K:) and
he buried it. (TA.) And الشَّىْءَ فِى صَدْرِى ↓ أَجْنَنْتُ

(Golius on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof.)
-A3-
جُنَّ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. جُنُونٌ (S, K) and جِنَّةٌ

اجنّهُ He (God) caused him to be, or become,
مَجْنُون [originally signifying possessed by a جِنِّىّ,
or by جِنّ; and hence generally meaning bereft
of reason; or mad, insane, unsound in mind or
intellect, or wanting therein]. (S, Msb, K.) [And
so, vulgarly, ↓ جنّنهُ, whoever, or whatever, be the
agent.] ―
-b2-  ما اجنّهُ [How mad, or insane, &c., is
he!] is anomalous, (Th, S,) being formed from a
verb of the pass. form, namely, جُنَّ; (Th, TA;)
for of the مَضْرُوب one should not say, مَا أَضْرَبَهُ;
nor of the مَسْلُول should one say, مَا أَسَلَّهُ: (S:)
Sb says that the verb of wonder is used in this
case because it denotes want of intellect [which
admits of degrees]. (TA.)

↓ جَنَانُ, (K, TA,) the last [written in the CK جُنان,
but it is] with fet-h: (TA:) or all signify its
intense darkness: (TA:) or all, the confusedness
of the darkness of night: (K:) [all, in these
senses, are app. inf. ns.: (see 1:)] the last, ↓ جَنَانٌ,
also signifies night [itself]: (K:) or [so in copies
of the K, accord. to the TA, but in the CK
“ and,”] the dense black darkness of night: (S,
K:) and ↓ جُنُونٌ, the veiling, or concealing, or
protecting, darkness of night. (ISk, S.) ―
-b2-  Concealment: so in the phrase, لَا جِنَّ بِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ
There is no concealment with this thing. (K, *
TA.) One of the Hudhalees says,
وَلَا جِنَّ بِالبَغْضَآءِ وَالنَّظَرِ الشَّزْرِ
[And there is no concealment with vehement
hatred and the looking with aversion]. (TA.)
-A2-  [The genii; and sometimes the angels;] accord. to some, the spiritual beings that are concealed from the senses, or that conceal themselves
from the senses; all of such beings; (Er-Rághib,
TA;) the opposite of إِنْسٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb, Er-Rághib, TA;) thus comprising the angels; all of
these being جِنّ; (Er-Rághib, TA;) thus called
because they are feared but not seen: (S:) or,
accord. to others, certain of the spiritual beings;
for the spiritual beings are of three kinds; the
good being the angels; and the evil being the
devils (شَيَاطِين); and the middle kind, among
whom are good and evil, being the جِنّ; as is
shown by the first twelve verses of ch. lxxii. of
the Kur: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or it here means
intelligent invisible bodies, predominantly of the
fiery, or of the aerial, quality: or a species of
souls, or spirits, divested of bodies: or human
souls separate from their bodies: (Bd:) or the
جِنّ are the angels [exclusively]; (K;) these
being so called in the Time of Ignorance, because
they were concealed, or because they concealed
themselves, from the eyes: so, accord. to some,
in the Kur [xviii. 48], where it is said that Iblees
was of the جِنّ: and so, as some say, in the Kur
[vi. 100], where it is said that they called the
جِنّ partners of God: (TA:) but some reject the
explanation in the K, because the angels were
created of light, and the جِنّ of fire; and the
former do not propagate their kind, nor are they
to be described as males and females; contrary to
the case of the جِنّ; wherefore it is generally
said that in the phrase [in the Kur xviii. 48,
above mentioned] إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ كَانَ مِنَ الجِنِّ, what
is excepted is disunited in kind from that from
which the exception is made, or that Iblees had
adopted the dispositions of the جِنّ: (MF, TA:)
or, as some say, the جِنّ were a species of the
angels, who were the guardians of the earth and
of the gardens of Paradise: (TA:) ↓ جِنَّةٌ, also,
signifies the same as جِنٌّ: (S, Msb, K:) so in
the last verse of the Kur: (S:) in the Kur
xxxvii. 158 meaning the angels, whom certain of
the Arabs worshipped; (TA;) and whom they
called the daughters of God: (Fr, TA:) a single
individual of the جِنّ is called ↓ جِنِّىٌّ, [fem. with
ة:] (S, TA:) and ↓ جَانٌّ, also, is syn. with جِنٌّ:
(Msb:) or الجَانٌ means the father of the جِنّ; (S,
Mgh, TA;) [i. e. any father of جِنّ; for] the pl. is
جِنَّانٌ, like حِيطَانٌ pl. of حَائِطٌ: (S, TA:) so says
El-Hasan: it is said in the T, on the authority of
AA, that the جانّ is, or are, of the جِنّ: (TA:) or
جَانٌّ is a quasi-pl. n. of جِنٌّ; (M, K;) like جَامِلٌ
and بَاقِرٌ: (M, TA:) so in the Kur lv. 56 and 74:
in reading the passage in the Kur lv. 39, 'Amr Ibn-
'Obeyd pronounced it جَأَنٌ: (TA:) it is related
that there were certain creatures called the جَانّ,
who were upon the earth, and who acted corruptly
therein, and shed blood, wherefore God sent angels
who banished them from the earth; and it is said
that these angels became the inhabitants of the
earth after them. (Zj, TA.) بَاتَ فُلَانٌ ضَيْفَ جِنٍّ
[Such a one passed the night a guest of جنّ]
means, in a desolate place, in which was no one
that might cheer him by his society or converse.
(TA.) The saying of Moosà Ibn-Jábir,
فَمَا نَفَرَتْ جِنِّى وَلَا فُلَّ مِبْرَدِى
may mean And my companions, who were like
the جِنّ, did not flee when I came to them and
informed them, nor was my tongue, that is like
the file, deprived of its sharp edge: or by his
جنّ he means his familiar جنّ, such as were
asserted to aid poets when difficulties befell them;
and by his مبرد, his tongue: (Ham p. 182 [where
other explanations are proposed; but they are
far-fetched]:) or by his جنّ he means his heart;
and by his مبرد, his tongue. (S.) The Arabs
liken a man who is sharp and effective in affairs
to a جِنِّىّ and a شَيْطَان: and hence they said,
نَفَرَتْ جِنُّهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He became weak and abject.
(Ham ubi suprà.) ―
-b2-  The greater, main, or chief,
part, or the main body, or bulk, of men, or of
mankind; as also ↓ جَنَانٌ; (K;) because he
who enters among them becomes concealed by
them: (TA:) or the latter means the general
assemblage, or collective body, of men: (IAar,
S, * TA:) or what veils, conceals, covers, or protects, one, of a thing. (AA, TA.) ―
-b3-  (tropical:)  The flowers,
or blossoms, of plants or herbage. (K, TA.) ―
-b4-
(tropical:)  The prime, or first part, of youth: (S, K, TA:)
or the sharpness, or vigorousness, and briskness,
liveliness, or sprightliness, thereof. (TA.) You
say, كَانَ ذٰلِك فِى جِنِّ شَبَابِهِ (tropical:)  That was in the
prime, or first part, of his youth. (S, TA.) And
أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ الأَمْرَ بِجِنِّ ذٰلِكَ (tropical:) I will do that thing
in the time of the first and fresh state of that.
(S, TA.) جِنٌّ may also signify (assumed tropical:)  The madness,
or insanity, of exultation, or of excessive exultation. (TA.) And one says, اِتّقِ النّاقَةَ فَإِنّهَا بِجِنِّ
ضِرَامِهَا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Fear thou the she-camel, for
she is in her evil temper on the occasion of her
bringing forth. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Also i. q. جدّ [app.
جِدٌّ, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Seriousness, or earnestness];
because it is a thing that is an accompaniment of
thought, or reflection, and is concealed by the
heart. (TA.)
جَنَّةٌ A [garden, such as is called] بُسْتَان: (S,
Mgh:) or a garden, or walled garden, (حَدِيقَة,
Msb, K,) of trees, or of palm-trees, (Msb,) or
of palms and other trees: (K:) or only if containing palm-trees and grape-vines; otherwise,
if containing trees, called حديقة: (Aboo-'Alee
in the Tedhkireh, TA:) or any بستان having
trees by which the ground is concealed: and sometimes concealing trees: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and
palm-trees: (S:) or tall palm-trees: (Mgh:) or
shadowing trees; because of the tangling, or
luxuriousness of their branches; as though concealing at once what is beneath them: then a
بستان; because of its dense and shadowing trees:
(Bd in ii. 23:) or a بستان of palms and other
trees, dense, and shadowing by the tangling, or
luxuriousness, and denseness, of their branches;
as though it were originally the inf. n. of un. of
جَنَّهُ, and meaning “ a single act of veiling ” or
“ concealing ” &c.: (Ksh ib.:) then, with the
article ال, [Paradise,] the abode of recompense;
because of the جِنَان therein; (Ksh and Bd ib.;)
or because the various delights prepared therein
for mankind are concealed in the present state of
existence: (Bd ib.:) [and] hence الجَنَّاتُ [the
gardens of Paradise], (so in a copy of the S,) or
جَنَّاتُ عَدْنٍ [the gardens of continual abode]: (so
in another copy of the S:) [for] the pl. of جَنَّةٌ
is أَجِنَّةٌ (Mgh, Msb, K) and جِنَيْنَة (Msb, TA)
and جُنَّةٌ, but this last is strange. (MF, TA.)

applied to A garden; as though it were a little
Paradise.]
جُنَّةٌ A thing by which a person is veiled, concealed, hidden, covered, or protected: an arm, or
