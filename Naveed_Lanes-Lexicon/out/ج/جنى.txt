جنى1
جَنَى الثَّمَرَةَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
جَنِىَ, (S,
Msb,) inf. n. جَنًى, (S, TA,) or جَنْىٌ, (so accord.
to one copy of the S, and written in the accus. case
جنيا in the Ham p. 355,) and جِنَايَةٌ, (Ham ib., but
there without any vowel-signs,) He gathered,
plucked, or took from the tree, the fruit; (Mgh,
TA;) i. q. ↓ اجتناها (S, Msb, K) and ↓ تجنّاها:
(K:) and in like manner one says of a thing similar
to fruit. (TA.) One says also, جَنَاهَا لَهُ and جَنَاهُ إِيَّاهَا
[He gathered it, plucked it, or took it from the
tree, for him]. (A'Obeyd, K.) And جَنَيْتُكَ أَكْمُؤًا
[I gathered for thee truffles]. (TA.) And جَنَى
ذَهَبًا He collected gold from its mine. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Aboo-Dhu-eyb uses this verb metaphorically, in
the phrase جَنَى العُلَى, meaning (tropical:)  [He acquired]
eminence, or nobility. (TA.) ―
-b3-  You also say,
جَنَى عَلَيْهِ, (S,) or عَلَى قَوْمِهِ, (Msb,) inf. n.
جِنَايَةٌ, (S, Msb,) (tropical:)  He committed, [against him,
or] against his people, or party, a crime, or an
offence for which he should be punished; (Msb;)
as also ↓ جاناهُ [or جانى قَوْمِهِ]: (TK in art. جر:)
[and (tropical:)  he brought an injury upon him, or them:]
and جَنَى الذَّنْبِ عَلَيْهِ, aor.
جَنِىَ, inf. n. جِنَايَةٌ, (K,)
with kesr, (TA,) (tropical:)  He committed the crime, offence,
or injurious action, against him; syn. جَرَّهُ إِلَيْهِ:
(K: [see art. جر:]) thus used, also, the verb is
metaphorical, from جَنَى الثَّمَرَةَ: (Er-Rághib, TA:)
and so in the phrase, جَنَى شَرًّا, meaning (tropical:)  He
brought to pass an evil thing or action. (Mgh.)
[See also جِنَايَةٌ, below.] It is said in a trad.,
لَا يَجْنِى جَانٍ إِلَّا عَلَى نَفْسِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [An injurer shall
not bring injury save on himself]; meaning that
one shall not be prosecuted for an injurious action
committed by another, of his relations or of others.
(TA.) And a poet says,
جَانِيكَ مَنْ يَجْنِى عَلَيْكَ وَقَدْ
تُعْدِي الصِّجَاحَ فَتَجْرَبُ الجُرْبُ
[which may be rendered, (assumed tropical:)  Thine injurer whom
thou shouldst punish is he who brings an injury
upon thee: but sometimes the mangy camels infect
the sound ones so that these become mangy; and
thus a criminal sometimes brings punishment
upon his relations: for] A'Obeyd says that جانيك
من يجنى عليك is a prov. applied to the case of a
man who is punished for an injurious action;
because brothers [sometimes] bring injury upon a
man [by occasioning his being punished for an
injurious action which they have themselves committed], as the latter hemistich of the verse cited
above indicates: but AHeyth says that this prov.
means الجَانِى لَكَ الخَيْرَ مَنْ يَجْنِى عَلَيْكَ الشَّرَّ [The
person bringing thee good is he who brings, or will
bring, upon thee evil: perhaps intended as a
caution; for the Arabs often suspect that a benefactor has some evil intention]: and he cites the
following hemistich:
تُعْدِي الصِّحَاحَ مَبَارِكُ الجُرْبِ
[meaning Sometimes the places where the mangy
camels lie down, and which afford benefit to other
camels, infect the sound ones]. (TA. [See also
Freytag's Arab. Prov., i. 298.]) You say also,
جَنَيْتَ هٰذَا عَلَى نَفْسِكَ [Thou hast brought this
as an injury upon thyself]. (K in art. جل.)

اجنى said of a tree, (S, K,) or of a palmtree, (Msb,) It had ripe fruit: (S:) or it attained
to the time for the gathering of its fruit: (Msb:)
or it attained to maturity: (K:) or, said of a
tree, it had fruit to be gathered and eaten: and,
said of fruit, it became ripe: (TA:) and, said of
grass, or herbage, it became abundant. (KL.)
―
-b2-  And اجنتِ الأَرْضُ The land had much جَنًى,
(S, Msb, K,) i. e. herbage, and truffles, and the
like. (S.)

-b2-  تجنّى عَلَيْهِ, (S, * K,) or تجنّى عليه
ذَنْبًا, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He accused him of a crime, an offence,
or an injurious action, that he had not committed;
(S, K;) i. e. he forged against him the charge of
his having committed a crime, &c., he being guiltless [thereof]: (TA:) النَّجَنِّى being like التَّجَرُّمُ.
(S.) You say also, يَتَجَنَّى عَلَيْنَا مَا لَمْ نَجْنِهِ [He
accuses us of committing what we did not commit].
(Abu-l-'Abbás, TA in art. جرم.)

إِجْتَنَىَ see 1. ―
-b2-  اِجْتَنَيْنَا مَآءِ مَطَرٍ We came to rainwater, and drank it: (K:) a phrase mentioned
with approval by IAar, but not explained by
him: thought by ISd to have this meaning. (TA.)
جَنًى [in the CK جَنِىٌّ] Whatever is gathered,
or plucked; as also ↓ جَنَاةٌ: (K:) or whatever
is gathered, or plucked, from trees, (S,) &c.; (so
in a copy of the S;) as also ↓ جَنَاةٌ: (S:) so that
these two words are of the same class as حِقٌّ and
حِقَّةٌ: or the latter of them is a n. un.: (TA:)
or the former signfies what is gathered from
trees while fresh; (Msb;) as also ↓ جَنِىٌّ: (Msb:)
or this last is an epithet applied to fruit, signifying
just gathered or plucked; (S, K;) or gathered,
or plucked, while fresh: (TA:) and ↓ مَجْنًى,
also, pl. مَجَانٍ, signifies fruit gathered or plucked:
(Har p. 369:) جَنًى also signifies fruit [ready to
be gathered or plucked]; so in the Kur lv. 54:
(Jel:) and is applied to fresh ripe dates: (Fr,
K:) and grapes: (TA:) and truffles, and the
like: (S:) and even cotton: (TA:) and herbage:
(S:) and gold, (K,) which is collected from its
mine: (TA:) and cowries, (K,) as though
gathered from the sea: (TA:) and honey, (K,)
when it is gathered: (TA:) pl. أَجْنَآءٌ (K) and
أَجْنٍ, originally أَجْنُىٌ. (TA.) Hence the saying,
هٰذَا جَنَاى وَ خِيَارُهُ فِيهِ
إِذْكُلُّ جَانٍ يَدُهُ إِلَى فِيهِ
[This is what I have gathered, and the best of it
is in it; when every gatherer but myself has his
hand to his mouth]: or, accord. to one reading,
وَ هِجَانُهُ فِيهِ (which has the same meaning, TA in
art. هجن): a prov., ascribed by Ibn-El-Kelbee
to 'Amr Ibn-' Adee El-Lakhmee, the son of the
daughter of Jedheemeh: he says that Jedheemeh
had ordered the people to gather for him truffles,
and some of them ate the best that they found;
but ' Amr brought to him the best that he found,
and addressed to him these words: and 'Alee is
related to have repeated them on an occasion of
his entering the government-treasury; meaning
that he had not defiled himself with anything of
the tribute belonging to the Muslims, but had
put it in its places. (TA.)

action: (Kull p. 134:) and in the language of

signifies the same as جِنَايَةٌ: (Ham p. 241:) the
pl. of جناية is جِنَايَاتٌ and جَنَايَا; but the latter
of these pls. is of rare occurrence. (Msb.)
جَنِيَّةٌ: see what next precedes.
