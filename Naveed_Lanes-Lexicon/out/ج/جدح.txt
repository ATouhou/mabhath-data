جَدَحَ, aor.
جَدَحَ, inf. n. جَدْحٌ, He mixed anything. (L.) جَدَحَ السَّوِيقُ, (S, A, Mgh, L, K,)
وَنَحْوَهُ, aor. and inf. n. as above; and ↓ جدّحهُ,

and ↓ اجدحهُ; (K;) He stirred about the سويق
[or meal made of parched barley or wheat], and
the like, with water, [or milk, (see what follows,)
or clarified butter, or fat of a sheep's tail, &c.,
(see لَتَّ,)] until the whole became of a uniform
consistence: (L:) or he stirred it about with a
مِجْدَح: (A, L:) or he stirred about the سويق
in milk, and the like, with a مجدح, until it
became mixed: (Lth, TA:) or he beat and mixed
the سويق with a مجدح: (Mgh:) i. q. لَتَّهُ:
(S, K:) and ↓ جدّحهُ, inf. n. تَجْدِيحٌ, he mixed
it; in the K, لَطَخَهُ; but the right reading is
خَلَطَهُ, as in the L and other lexicons: (TA:)
and ↓ اجتدحهُ he drank it (شربه [but this is perhaps a mistranscription for ضَرَبَهُ he beat it]) with
the مجدح. (L, TA.)

المُجْدَحُ: see the next paragraph.
مِجْدَحٌ The instrument with which سَوِيق is
stirred about with water &c.; (S, A, K, &c.;)
which is a piece of wood the end whereof has
several sides; (S, L;) or a piece of wood at the
head of which are two cross pieces of wood; (A,
Mgh, L;) and sometimes having three prongs:
(IAth, TA:) pl. مَجَادِحُ. (L.) ―
-b2-  It is sometimes used tropically, as relating to evil, or
mischief. (L.) [Thus it means (tropical:)  A stirrer-up
of evil or mischief; or a thing that stirs up, or
whereby one stirs up, evil or mischief.] ―
-b3-  Also
(assumed tropical:)  Any one of the مَجَادِيحُ السَّمَآءِ [or stirrers-up
of the sky, or of rain]; (L;) these being the
أَنْوَآءٌ [or stars, or asterisms, which, by their
auroral settings or risings, were believed by the
Pagan Arabs to bring rain &c.]; (S, L, K;)
of those انواء that seldom or never failed [to bring
rain], accord. to the Arabs: (Mgh:) the ى in
the pl. is added to give fulness to the sound of
the kesreh; for the regular pl. is مَجَادِحُ, and
the sing. of مجاديح should by rule be مِجْدَاحٌ.
(A, IAth, Mgh.) One says, ارْسَلَتِ السَّمَآءَ مَجَادِيحُهَا
(L) or مَجَادِيحُ الغَيْثِ (A) (assumed tropical:)  [Its stirrers-up, or
the stirrers-up of rain, or the stars or asterisms
which were the bringers of it, sent forth rain].
It is related of 'Omar, that he ascended the
pulpit to pray for rain, and, having only offered
a prayer for forgiveness, descended; whereupon
it was said to him, “Thou hast not prayed for
rain; ” and he replied, لَقَدِ اسْتَسْقَيْتُ بِمَجَادِيحِ
السَّمَآءِ (assumed tropical:) [I have indeed prayed for rain by words
which are the stirrers-up of rain]; making the
prayer for forgiveness to be a prayer for rain, in
allusion to a passage in the Kur, lxxi. 9 and 10;
and meaning thereby to deny the efficacy of the
انواء. (A, * Mgh, * L.) المِجْدَحُ, also pronounced
↓ المُجْدَحُ, (S, K,) thus pronounced by El-Umawee, (S,) is moreover the name of (assumed tropical:) A particular
star or asterism, one of those which the Pagan
Arabs asserted to be bringers of rain: (L:) said
to be الدَّبَرَانُ [the Hyades; or the five chief stars
thereof; or  the brightest star thereof, a of
Taurus]; (S, A, L, K;) [which is called by this
name of الدبران] because it rises latterly [with
respect to the Pleiades], (S,) or because it follows
(يَدْبُرُ, i. e. يَتْبَعُ,) the Pleiades: (T in art. دبر:)
[whence] it is also called حَادِى النُّجُومِ [“ the
urger of the stars,” properly, “with singing ”],
(S,) or حَادِى النَّجْمِ [“ the urger of the asterism,”
meaning, “of the Pleiades ”], and تَالِى النَّجْمِ
[“ the follower of the asterism,” or, “of the
Pleiades ”], (Kzw,) and التَّالِى and التَّابِعُ [“ the
follower ”]: (Sh:) or it is a small star or asterism,
between الدبران and الثُّرَيَّا [or the Pleiades]:
(IAar, K:) [perhaps meaning the four stars that
are the chief stars of the Hyades exclusively of
a Tauri:] or three stars, (Mgh, TA,) like the
three stones upon which a cooking-pot rests, (TA,)
likened to a three-pronged مِجْدَح; (Mgh, TA;)
on the [auroral] rising of which, heat is expected:
(TA:) the Arabs regarded it as one of the انواء
which [by their auroral setting] foretokened
rain. (IAth.) المِجْدَحَانِ is a name by which
some of the Arabs called (assumed tropical:) The two wings of
الجَوْزَآء [or Orion]. (Sh, TA.) ―
-b4-  مِجْدَحٌ also
signifies (assumed tropical:) A certain mark made with a hot iron
upon the thighs of camels. (K.)
مُجَدَّحٌ Beverage, or wine, (شَرَاب,) stirred
about: (S, K:) and in like manner, blood, when
it is stirred about in the body of a gored animal
by the goring horn. (L.)
مَجْدُوحٌ Blood drawn from a vein, used in
times of dearth, or drought, (S, K,) in the Time
of Ignorance: (S:) or blood which was mixed
with something else, and eaten in times of dearth:
(TA:) or a kind of food of the Pagan Arabs,
being blood obtained by opening a vein of a she-camel, which blood was received in a vessel, and
drunk. (T, TA.)
