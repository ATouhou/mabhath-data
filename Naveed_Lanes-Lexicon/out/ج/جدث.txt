جدث8
اجتدث He made, or prepared, a جَدَث,
i. e., a grave, or sepulchre; or did so for himself.
(S, K, TA.)
جَدَثٌ A grave; a sepulchre; pl. أَجْدَاثٌ (S,
Msb, K) and أَجْدُثٌ; (S, K;) of which latter,
J cites an ex., but in this instance it is the proper
name of a place. (TA.) It is of the dial. of
Tihámeh: the people of Nejd say جَدَفٌ: (Msb:)
or [as some say] the ف in the latter is a substitute
for the ث in the former; for اجداث is used as a
pl. by common consent, and اجداف is not used:
(TA:) but Suh affirms, in the R, that the latter
pl. is used by Ru-beh. (TA in art. جدف.)
