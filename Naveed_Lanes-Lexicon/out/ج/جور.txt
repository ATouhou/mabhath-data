and ↓ جُوَارٌ, (S, M, and some copies of the K,) or
the last is a simple subst., (Msb,) and ↓ جَوَارٌ, (M,
and so in some copies of the K instead of جُوَارٌ,)
of which forms the second (جِوَارٌ) is more chaste
than the third (S, TA) and than the fourth, as

though some disapprove of it, and assert the third
and the fourth to be more chaste; (TA;) He
became his جار [or neighbour]; (K;) he lived in
his neighbourhood, or near to him: (Msb, TA:)

affairs distracting the mind from devotion and
not pressing]. (S, K.) But جاور بِمَكَّةَ, and بِالمَدِينَةِ,
signifies absolutely He abode in Mekkeh, and
El-Medeeneh; not necessarily implying conformity with the conditions of اِعْتِكَاف required
by the law [though generally meaning for the
purpose of study: and so in the neighbourhood of
the great collegiate mosque called the Azhar, in
Cairo: so that the term ↓ مُجَاوِرٌ means a student
of Mekkeh &c.]. (TA.)
4
اجارهُ, (S, A, &c.,) inf. n. إِجَارَةٌ (Mgh, K)

him; granted him refuge; (K;) preserved, saved,
rescued, or liberated, him; (S, A, Msb, K;) from
(مِنْ) wrongful, unjust, injurious, or tyrannical,

protect me against God. (TA.) ―

6
تَجَاوَرُوا and ↓ اِجْتَوَرُوا (S, K) are syn., (S,)
signifying They became mutual neighbours; they
lived near together: (K, * TA:) the [radical] و
in the latter verb remaining unaltered because
this verb is syn. with one in which the و
must preserve its original form on account of
the quiescence of the preceding letter, namely,
تجاوروا, (S, TA,) and to show that it is syn.
therewith: but اِجْتَارُوا also occurs. (TA.) ―
-b2-
[Also They bound themselves by a covenant to
protect one another.]
