-A3-  جُدِرَ,

aor.
جَدُرَ, inf. n. جَدْرٌ; (Lh, TA;) and ↓ جُدِّرَ, (S,
(A, K,) which last some disallow, because this form
denotes repetition, and the verb signifies the having
a disease that befalls but once in a man's life;
(MF;) He (a man, S, or a child, A) had, or
became attacked by, جُدَرِىّ [or small-pox]. (S,
A, K.) [And جَدَرَ الجُدَرِىُّ The small-pox came
forth, or broke out; as in the TK: for its inf. n.]
جَدْرٌ signifies the coming forth, or breaking out,
of the جُدَرِىّ. (K.)

لَهُ ] He was, or became, adapted, disposed, apt,
&c., for it. (A.) [And  جَدُرَ أَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا  He

adapted or disposed, or how apt, meet, suited,
suitable, fitted, fit, competent, or proper, is he for
what is good! or how worthy is he of what is good!
(A.) And مَا أَجْدَرَهُ أَنْ يَفْعَلَ ذٰلِكَ, and أَجْدِرْ بِهِ,
How well adapted or disposed, or how apt, meet,
&c., is he for doing that! or how worthy is he

the assertion of certain grammarians that these
two forms of the verb deviate from general rule.

or constructed it firmly and strongly, and raised

read اِجتَدَرَ بِنَاهُ, as though the pronoun ه referred
to the word جِدَار, which precedes; and thus the
verb signified “ he built a wall; ” but it is shown
in the TA that the right reading is that given
above.]
