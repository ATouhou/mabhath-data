جدو1
جَدَا عَلَيْهِ, (Msb, K,) and جَدَاهُ, first pers.
جَدَوْتُ, (IB, TA,) aor.
جَدُوَ, (K,) inf. n. جَدْوٌ (Msb,
TA) and جَدًا; (Msb;) and عَلَيْهِ ↓ اجدى, (Msb,
K,) and ↓ اجداهُ, (S,) the prep. in the former of
these two being suppressed in the latter; (TA;)
and ↓ اجتداهُ; (TA;) He gave him a gift. (S,
IB, Msb, K, * TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] جَدَا عَلَيْهِ شُؤْمَهُ
(assumed tropical:)  He drew his evil fortune, or ill luck, upon him:
an ironical expression; [for it literally means he
gave him, or bestowed upon him, his evil fortune.]
(TA.) ―
-b3-  Hence also, عَلَيْكَ ↓ اجدى (tropical:)  It (a
thing) sufficed thee. (Msb.) فِعْلُهُ شَيْئًا ↓ مَا أَجْدَى
(tropical:)  His deed, or act, did not profit him, or avail
him, aught. (Msb.) And عَنْكَ هٰذَا ↓ مَا يُجْدِى
(assumed tropical:)  This does not stand thee in any stead; does not
profit thee, or avail thee. (S.)
-A2-  جَدَوْتُهُ, (S,
IB, Msb, K, *) [aor.
جَدُوَ,] inf. n. جَدْوٌ; (K;) and
جَدَيْتُهُ; (K in art. جدى;) and ↓ اِجْتَدَيْتُهُ, (S,
Msb, K, *) and ↓ اِسْتَجْدَيْتُهُ; I sought, or demanded, (S,) or asked, (IB, Msb, K,) of him (S,
IB, Msb, K) a gift, (S,) or a thing wanted. (K.)
[See an ex. of the last of these verbs in a verse
cited in art. تا.] Hence, مُجَادَاةٌ [inf. n. of
↓ جادى]: whence, in a trad., وَقَدْ عَرَفُوا أَنَّهُ لَيْسَ
عِنْدَ مَرْوَانَ مَالٌ يُجَادُونَهُ عَلَيْهِ, meaning يَسْأَلُونَهُ
عَلَيْهِ [i. e. And they knew that there was not, in
the possession of Marwán, property for which
they should ask as owed by him]. (TA.)

جَدًا i. q. جَدْوَى, q. v. ―
-b2-  Hence, (Har p. 32,)
جَدًا, (K,) also written جَدًى, (ISk, TA,) or
مَطَرٌ جَدًا, (S,) and, accord. to the K, ↓ جَدْوَى,
but this latter is not known except as signifying
“ a gift,” (TA,) A common, or general, rain;
(S, K, TA;) of wide extent: (TA:) or of which
the uttermost is not known. (K.) One says
also سَمَآءٌ جَدًا, meaning A rain having a rain
following it; making the latter word masc.
because it has the force of an inf. n. (TA.)
And اَلّٰهُمَّ اسْقِنَا غَدَقًا وَجَدًا طَبَقًا [O God,
water us with a copious rain, and a rain that
shall cover the land]: (S, TA:) occurring in a
trad. respecting prayer for rain. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And
خَيْرٌ جَدًا Ample good; (K;) of wide extent
to men. (TA.)
-A2-  لَا آتِيكَ جَدَا الدَّهْرِ (S, * K, *
TA) i. e. [I will not come to thee] ever, like
يَدَ الدَّهْرِ; (S, TA;) or to the end of time. (K,
TA.)
جَدْوَى A gift; (S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ جَدًا:
(S, K:) dual (of the former, TA) جَدْوَانِ and
جَدْيَانِ; (Lh, M, K;) the former, regular; (M,
TA;) the latter, anomalous, (M, K, TA,) formed
by commutation. (M, TA.) You say, مَا أَصَبْتُ
مِنْ فُلَانٍ جَدْوَى قَطُّ [I have not obtained from
such a one a gift ever]. (TA.) And hence the
prov., شَغَلَتْ شِعَابِى  جَدْوَاىBَ: see art. شعب. (S
in that art.) ―
-b2-  See also جَدًا.
جَدَآءٌ  profit, utility, or avail. (S, TA.) So in
the saying,  فُلَانٌ قَلِيلُ الجَدَآءِ عَنْكَ  [Such a one
is of little profit, utility, or avail, to thee; will
stand thee in little stead]. (S.)
جَدِىٌّ [originally جَدِيوٌ] Munificent, or bountiful. (TA.)
جَادٍ Asking, seeking, or demanding, (S, K,) a
bounty, or benefit, (S,) or gift: (K:) pl. جُدَاةٌ.
(TA.)
أَجْدَى [More, and most, profitable, useful, or
availing]. It is said in a prov., أَجْدَى مِنَ الغَيْثِ
فِى أَوَانِهِ [More profitable than rain in its season].
(Meyd.)
