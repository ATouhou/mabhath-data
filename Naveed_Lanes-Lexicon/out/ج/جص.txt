جص2
جصّص He plastered a building with جِصّ
[or gypsum]: (Mgh, K:) or he made a house
therewith: (Msb:) i. q. قَصَّصَ, (S, TA,) which
is of the dial. of El-Hijáz. (TA.)
جِصٌّ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and جَصٌّ (S, Mgh,
K,) but the former is the more chaste: (TA,
from an Expos. of the Fs:) the latter is disapproved by IDrd, and disallowed by ISk;
(TA;) and it is said in the Bári', on the authority of AHát, that the latter is the form used
by the vulgar, and the former is that which is
correct: (Msb:) [Gypsum; a certain substance]
with which one builds, (S,) or plasters; (Mgh;)
well known: (Msb, K:) arabicized; (S, Mgh,
Msb, K;) because ج and ص do not occur in
any Arabic word; (Msb;) or, accord. to AZ,
there are some [Arabic] words in which they
both occur, as has been mentioned in art. اجص:
from كَجْ (Mgh, K, [in the CK كَچْ]) or, as
some say, گَچْ; which are Persian: (TA:) in
the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, قصّ [i. e.قِصٌّ
or قَصٌّ]. (Lth, TA.) [The n. un. is with ة: see
art. قص.]
جَصَّاصٌ A preparer of جِصّ [or gypsum].
(S, K.)
جَصَّاصَاتٌ [pl. of جَصَّاصَةٌ] Places in which
جِصّ [or gypsum] is made. (K.)
