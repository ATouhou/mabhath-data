جَلَسَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.
جَلِسَ, (A, K,) inf. n.
جُلُوسٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ مَجْلَسٌ, (S, A, K,)
He placed his seat, or posteriors, upon rugged
[or rather elevated] ground, such as is termed
جَلْسٌ: this is the primary signification: (TA:)
[and hence,] He sat; i. q. قَعَدَ [when the latter
is used in its largest sense]: (Msb, and so S and
L and A and K in art. قعد:) you say, جَلَسَ مُتَرَبِّعًا
and قَعَدَ مُتَرَبِّعًا [He sat cross-legged]: (Msb:)
accord. to El-Fárábee and others, contr. of قَامَ;
and thus it has a more common application than
قَعَدَ [when the latter is used in its most proper
and restricted sense]: (Msb:) but قَعَدَ also signifies the contr. of قَامَ: ('Orweh Ibn-Zubeyr, L
in art. قعد:) properly speaking, جَلَسَ differs
from قَعَدَ; the former signifying he sat up; or
sat after sleeping, or prostration, (Msb,) or after
lying on his side; (B, TA;) and the latter, he
sat down; or sat after standing: (Msb, B, TA:
and see other authorities to the same effect in art.
قعد:) for جُلُوسٌ is a change of place from low
to high, and قُعُودٌ is a change of place from high
to low: and one says, جَلَسَ مُتَّكِئًا, but not قَعَدَ
مُتَّكِئًا, meaning [He sat] leaning, or reclining,
upon one side: (Msb:) but both these verbs
sometimes signify he was, or became: and thus,
[it is said,] جَلَسَ مُتَرَبِّعًا and فَعَدَ مُتَرَبِّعًا signify
he was, or became, cross-legged: and جَلَسَ بَيْنَ
شُعَبِهَا الأَرْبَعِ in like manner signifies he was, or
became, [between her four limbs,] (El-Fárábee,
Msb,) because the man, in this case, is resting
upon his own four limbs. (Msb.) [جَلَسَ مَعَهُ
and جَلَسَ إِلَيْهِ, like خَلَا معه and خلا اليه, signify
the same; i. e. He sat with him: or the latter,
he sat by him; like “ assedit ei. ”] An instance
of the inf. n. مَجْلَسٌ is found in a trad., in which
it is said, فَإِذَا أَتَيْتُمْ إِلَى المَجْلِسِ فَأَعْطُوا الطَّرِيقَ حَقَّهُ
[But when ye come to sitting, perform ye the
duties relating to the road]. (TA.) [The trad.
commences thus: إِيَّاكُمْ وَالجُلُوسَ عَلَى الطُّرُقَاتِ
Beware ye of sitting on the roads: and then,
after the words before cited, (in which, however,
in my copy of the Jámi' es-Sagheer, instead of
المجلس, I find المَجَالِسِ, which is pl. of المَجْلِسُ,)
it is added that the duties thus alluded to are the
lowering of the eyes, the putting away or aside
what is hurtful or annoying, the returning of
salutations, the enjoining of that which is good,
and the forbidding of that which is evil.] ―
-b2-
جَلَسَتِ الرَّخَمَةُ (tropical:)  The aquiline vulture lay upon its
breast on the ground; syn. جَثَمَت: a saying
applied to him who is of the seceders. (A, TA.)
[See also قَعَدَ.] ―
-b3-  جَلَسَ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  It (a
thing, as, for instance, a plant,) remained, or
continued. (AHn, TA.) ―
-b4-  Also, (aor.
جَلِسَ, inf. n.
جَلْسٌ, TA,) He came to الجَلْس, (TA,) or [the
high country called] Nejd: (T, S, A, TA:) and
in like manner said of a cloud; it came to Nejd.
(TA.)

جالسهُ, inf. n. مُجَالَسَةٌ and جِلَاسٌ, [He sat
with him.] (TA.) You say, لَا تُجَالِسْ مَنْ لَا
تُجَانِسْ [Sit not with him with whom thou wilt
not be congenial]. (A, TA.) And كَرِيمُ النِّحَاسِ
طَيِّيبُ الجِلَاسِ [Generous in origin, or disposition;
pleasant to sit with;] is said of a man. (TA.)
4
اجلسهُ [He seated him; made him to sit:
or he made him to sit up]: (S, K, TA:) he gave
him place, or settled him, (مَكَّنَهُ,) in sitting. (TA.)

sit: or to sit up.]. You say, رَآنِى قَائِمًا فَاسْتَجْلَسَنِى
[He saw me standing, and he asked me, or desired
me, to sit]: (A, TA:) but this is at variance with
what we have mentioned in the beginning of the
art., respecting the distinction [between جَلَسَ and
قَعَدَ]. (TA.)
جَلْسٌ Rugged ground or land: (S, K:) this is
the primary signification. (TA.) ―

-A2-  [Persons sitting: or sitting up:]
a quasi-pl. n., accord. to Sb, or a pl., accord. to
Akh, of ↓ جَالِسٌ: said to be used as sing. and pl.
and fem. and masc.; but this assertion is of no
account: (ISd, L:) or the people of a مَجْلِس:
(Lh, ISd, L, K:) [↓ جُلُوسٌ is also a pl. of ↓ جَالِسٌ;
like as بُكِىٌّ, originally بُكُوىٌ, is of بَاكِ: or it is
an inf. n. used as an epithet: see جَاثٍ:)] you
say قَوْمٌ جُلُوسٌ [a company of men sitting: or
sitting up]. (S.) [See also مَجْلِسٌ.] ―
-b2-  Also A
woman who sits in the فِنَآء [or court of the house],

(S, K.)
جُلُوسٌ: see جَلْسٌ.

found in a copy of the K, [but this is an intensive
form,]) and ↓ جِلْسٌ (S, A, K) A companion with
whom one sits: (A, Msb, K:) fem. of the first

-b2-  and see مَجْلِسٌ.
مَجْلِسٌ A sitting-place; (S, Msb, K;) as also
↓ with ة; (Fr, Lh, Sgh, K;) similar to مَكَانٌ and
مَكَانَةٌ: (Sgh, TA:) [a place where persons sit
together and converse; a sitting-room:] a thing
upon which one sits: (MF:) some make a strange
distinction between مَجْلِسٌ and ↓ مَجْلَسٌ, asserting
the former to be applied to the chamber or house
(بَيْت) [in which people sit]; and the latter, to a
place of honour upon which it is forbidden to sit
without permission; but the former is the only
correct form of the two: (MF, TA:) pl. مَجَالِسُ.
(S, Msb.) You say, اُرْزُنْ فِى مَجْلِسِكَ and ↓ مَجْلِسَتِكَ
[Be thou grave] in thy sitting-place. (Fr, Sgh.)

-b4-  It is also used in the same
manner as حَضْرَة and جَنَاب: you say مَجْلِسُ فُلَانٍ
[meaning (assumed tropical:)  The object of resort, with whom others
sit and converse, such a one]; like حَضْرَةُ فُلَانٍ.
(Kull p. 146.) [See arts. حضر and جنب. But
this usage I believe to be post-classical.] ―
-b5-  [Also
(assumed tropical:)  A stool; meaning, an evacuation. So in medical
books.]
