and, applied to a horse and a camel, of the
colour termed أَدْهَم, (S, K,) intensely black: (S:)
every camel, and every wild ass, seen from a
distance, is of this colour: fem. with ة: (T, TA:)
and, applied to a plant, or herbage, green, (K,)
or intensely green, (TA,) inclining to blackness:
(K, TA:) pl. جُونٌ; (S, TA;) like as صُتْمٌ is of
صَتْمٌ, (S,) and وُرْدٌ of وَرْدٌ. (M, TA.) You say
also, الشَّمْسُ جَوْنَةٌ The sun is characterized by
what is termed جُونَةٌ: (S:) or is intensely glistening and clear. (Az, TA.) [See also جَوْنَةٌ below.]

The white man: opposed to أَبُوالبَيْضَآءِ meaning
the negro. (TA in art. بيض.) ―
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Day:

جَوْنَةٌ The sun; (K;) [i. e.] the sun's disc;
because it becomes black [or of a blackish colour
tinged with red] at setting; (S;) or it may be
because of its whiteness and clearness; but it is
said to be only applied to the sun when it is
setting; opposed to غَزَالَةٌ; as observed by MF:
(TA:) [see also جَوْنٌ:] the sun is also called
↓ جَوْنَآءُ, (K,) because of its becoming black [or of
a blackish colour tinged with red] at setting.

meaning A red thing]. (K.) ―

the sun, also, the quality denoted by جَوْنَةٌ [as
fem. of جَوْنٌ, q. v.]: and blackness; as in the
saying, لَا أَفْعَلُهُ حَتَّى تَبْيَضَّ جُونَةُ القَارِ [I will not
do it until the blackness of pitch, or tar, become
white]: but if you say القَارِ ↓ جَوْنَةُ, the meaning
is the خَابِية [smeared with tar, or pitch]. (S.)
-A2-
A small basket (سُلَيْلَة), (K,) or سَفَط, (K in art.
جأن,) of a round form, (TA,) that is with the

kind of bird called قَطًا, (S, K,) black in the belly
and wings, larger than the [species called] كُدْرِىّ,
one of the former species being equal to two of
the latter: (S, TA:) or, accord. to ISk, the قطا
compose two species; one called جُونِىٌّ and
كُدْرِىٌّ; and the other, غَطَاطٌ; and the former
is dusky, or dingy, or of a hue inclining to black
and dust-colour, (أَكْدَر,) in the back, black in
the inner side of the wing, yellow in the throat,
short in the legs, having in the tail two feathers
longer than the rest of the tail: (T, TA:) or,
as some say, the كُدْرِيَّة and جُونِيَّة are one of
the two species of the قطا, and the other is the
غطاط; and the former are short in the legs, yellow
in the necks, black in the primary feathers of the
wings, of a white hue tinged with red (صُهْب) in
the tertials: (TA voce غطاط, q. v.:) [but see
كُدْرِىٌّ: the جونىّ is described by De Sacy, on
the authority of the book entitled درّة المنتقاة من
عجائب المخلوقات وغرائب الموجودات, thus: “ le
djouni a les barbes internes des ailes et les pennes
primaires noires; il a la gorge blanche, ornée de
deux colliers, l'un jaune et l'autre noir; son dos
est d'un gris cendré, moucheté, mêlé d'un peu de
jaune: on appelle cette espèce djouni, parce que
sa voix ne rend pas un son clair et sonore, mais
qu'elle fait entendre seulement une sorte de gargouillement dans le gosier: ” (Chrest. Arabe,
2nd ed., ii. 369:)] it is stated in the handwriting
of As, on the authority of the Arabs, that جونىّ,
applied to the قطا, is with ء; app. meaning that it
was pronounced جُؤُنِىٌّ: (M, TA:) a single bird
of this species is termed جُونِيَّةٌ: (S:) and you
say also ↓ قَطَاةٌ جَوْنَةٌ, with fet-h: (TA:) [but
جُونِىٌّ seems to be also used as a n. un., like
رُومِىٌّ: for it is said that] جُونٌ is pl. [or rather
coll. gen. n.] of جُونىٌّ, like as تَمْرٌ is of تَمْرَةٌ.
