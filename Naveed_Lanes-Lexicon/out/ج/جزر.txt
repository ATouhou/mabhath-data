أَجْزَرْتُهُ شَاةً I gave to him a ewe or a ram or a

أَجْزَرْتُكَ بَعِيرًا, or شَاةً, I gave to thee a camel, or a
sheep or goat, that thou mightest slaughter it:
(A:) [but] accord. to ISk, one does not say
أَجْزَرْتُهُمْ نَاقَةً, because a she-camel is fit for other

جِزَرٌ: see جَزَرٌ, in three places.
جِزَارٌ The time of the cutting off of the fruit of
palm-trees. (Yz, TA.) [See also 1.]
جَزُورٌ A camel [that is slaughtered, or to be
slaughtered]; (K;) applied to the male and the
female: (S, Msb:) or (as some say, Sgh, Msb)
properly a she-camel that is slaughtered: (Sgh,
Msb, K:) but the former is the correct assertion;
(TA;) though the word is fem., (IAmb, S, Msb,
TA,) on the authority of hearsay; (TA;) therefore you say, رَعَتِ الجَزُورء [the camel for slaughter
pastured]: (IAmb, Msb:) or when used alone,
it is fem., because what are slaughtered are mostly
she-camels: (TA:) and when used as a common
term, it implies the like of predominance [of the
fem. gender]: (Háshiyeh of Esh-Shiháb, TA:)
[the shares into which the جزور is divided in the
game called المَيْسِر are described voce بَدْءٌ:] pl.
جُزُرٌ (S, Msb, K) and جَزَائِرُ and جُزُرَاتٌ, (Msb,
K,) the last of which is pl. of جُزُرٌ, like as طُرُقَاتٌ
is of طُرُقٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also جَزَرٌ.
جُزَارَةٌ, of a camel, The extremities; (S, A;)
namely, (S,) the fore and kind legs, (اليَدَانِ
وَالرِّجْلَانِ, S, K,) and the head, (S,) or neck: (A,
K:) because the slaughterer receives them; (S;)
they being his hire, (S, K,) or right, (A,) not
being included among the shares in the game
called المَيْسِر. (TA.) But when a horse is said
to be عَبْلُ الجُزَارَةِ, (S,) or ضَخْمُ الجُزَارَةِ, (M,)
what is meant is thickness of the fore and hind
legs, and abundance of sinews; and the head is
not included, because largeness of the head, in a
horse, is a fault. (S, M.)
جِزَارَةٌ The trade of him who slaughters camels
(Mgh, Msb, K, * TA) and other animals. (Msb.)
جَزِيرَةٌ (tropical:)  An island; land in the sea [or in a
river], from which the water has flowed away, so
that it appears; (Az, Mgh;) and in like manner,
land which a torrent does not overflow, but which
it surrounds; (Az, TA;) land from which the
tide retires; as also ↓ جَزَرٌ: (K:) so called
because cut off from the main land: (S:) or
because of the retiring of the water from it:
(Msb:) pl. جَزَائِرُ: (S, Mgh:) [also, a peninsula:]
and a piece of ground or land. (Kr, TA.)
جَزَّارٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ جِزِّيرٌ (K) and
↓ جَازِرٌ (A) One who slaughters camels (A, Mgh,
Msb, K) and other animals. (Msb.)

مَجْزَرٌ, (Msb, K,) or مَجْزِرٌ, with kesr to the ز,
(S, Ibn-Málik,) contr to rule, as the aor. of the verb

↓ مَجْزَرَةٌ [or مَجْزِرَةٌ], (Msb,) A place where camels
are slaughtered, (S, Msb, K,) and other animals,
(Msb,) namely, bulls and cows and sheep and
goats, and where their flesh is sold: pl. مَجَازِرُ.
(TA.) In a trad. of 'Omar, persons are enjoined
to avoid مَجَازِر, (S, TA,) meaning as above;
because of their uncleanness; (TA;) or because
the witnessing of the slaughter of animals hardens
the heart and dispels mercy: (IAth, TA:) or the
meaning is, places of assembly; because a camel
is slaughtered only where people are collected
together: (S, TA:) the ↓ مَجْزَرَة is one of the
places in which it is forbidden to perform the
usual prayers. (Mgh.)
مَجْزَرَةٌ or مَجْزِرَةٌ: see مَجْزَرٌ, in two places.
