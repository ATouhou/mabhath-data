[See also جَرَّتْ.]) (tropical:)  She (a mare) exceeded eleven
months and did not foal: (K, TA:) the more
she exceeds the usual term, the stronger is her
foal; and the longest time of excess after eleven
months is fifteen nights: accord. to AO, the time
of a mare's gestation, after she has ceased to be
covered, to the time of her foaling, is eleven
months; and if she exceed that time at all, they

K, TA:) or إِجْرَارُ الفَصِيلِ signifies (tropical:)  the slitting

like the whirl, or hemispherical head, of a spindle,
and then boring the tongue of the [young] camel,

teat: so say some: (ISk, TA:) the animal upon
which the operation has been performed is said to
be ↓ مَجْرُورٌ and ↓ مُجَرٌّ. (TA.) [But sometimes
↓ جَرَّ signifies merely He drew away a young
camel from its mother: see خَلِيَّةٌ voce خَلِىٌّ, in
three places.] ―
-b7-  Hence, اجرّ لِسَانَهُ (tropical:)  He prevented

نَطَقْتُ وَلٰكِنَّ الرِّمَاحَ أجَرَّتِ

to speak, I had spoken; but the spears have prevented speech]: i. e., had they fought, and shown

gulps, so that it sounded, or made a sound or
sounds; (A, Msb, TA;) as also ↓ the latter verb.
(K, * TA.) It is said in a trad., (of him who
drinks from a vessel of gold or silver, Mgh, TA,)
يُجَرْجِرُ فِى بَطْنِهِ نَارَ جَهَنَّمَ He shall drink down
into his belly the fire of Hell (Az, A, Mgh, Msb)
in consecutive gulps, so that it shall make a
sound or sounds: (A:) or he shall make the fire
of Hell to gurgle reiteratedly in his belly; from
جَرْجَرَ said of a stallion-camel. (Mgh.) Most
read النارَ, as above; but accord. to one reading,
it is النارُ, (Z, Msb,) and the meaning is, (tropical:)  The
fire of Hell shall produce sounds in his belly
like those which a camel makes in his windpipe:
the verb is here tropically used; and is masc.,
with ى, because of the separation between it and
النار: (Z, TA:) but this reading and explanation
are not right. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  You say also, جَرْجَرَهُ المَآءَ
He poured water down his throat so that it made
a sound or sounds. (K, * TA.)

a mountain; (S, A, K;) like ذَيْلٌ: (A, TA:) or
the place where it rises from the plain to the
rugged part: (IDrd, TA:) or الجّرُّ أَصْلُ الجَبَلِ
is a mistranscription of Fr, and is correctly
الجُرَاصِلُ الجَبَلُ [i. e. جُراصِلٌ signifies “a mountain”]: (K:) but جُرَاصِلٌ is not mentioned [elsewhere] in the K, nor by any one of the writers
on strange words; and [SM says,] there is evidently no mistranscription: جَرُّ الجَبَلِ occurs in a
trad., meaning the foot, &c., of the mountain:

Msb, K) and جَرَّاتٌ (Msb) and ↓ جَرٌّ, (T, S, Msb,
K,) [or this last is rather a coll. gen. n., signifying pottery, or jars, &c.,] like تَمْرٌ in relation
to تَمْرَةٌ; or, accord. to some, this is a dial. var.
of جَرَّةٌ. (Msb.) Beverage of the kind called
نَبِيذ made in such a vessel is forbidden in a trad.:
(Mgh, TA:) but accord. to IAth, the trad. means
a vessel of this kind glazed within, because the
beverage acquires strength, and ferments, more
quickly in a glazed earthen vessel. (TA.)
-A2-
See also جِرَّةٌ:
-A3-  and see what here next follows.
جُرَّةٌ (S, K) and ↓ جَرَّةٌ (K) A small piece of
wood, (K,) or a piece of wood about a cubit long,
(S,) having a snare at the head, (S, K,) and a
cord at the middle, (S,) with which gazelles are

it, he strives with it awhile, and struggles in it,
and labours at it, to escape; and when it has
overcome him, and he is wearied by it, he
becomes still, and remains in it; and this is
what is termed [in a prov. mentioned below] his
becoming at peace with it: (S, * TA:) or it is
a staff, or stick, tied to a snare, which is hidden
in the earth, for catching the gazelle; having
cords of sinew; when his fore leg enters the
snare, the cords of sinew become tied in knots
upon that leg; and when he leaps to escape, and
stretches out his fore leg, he strikes with that
staff, or stick, his other fore leg and his hind leg,
and breaks them. (AHeyth, TA.) نَاوَصَ الجُرَّةَ ثُمَّ

it, and then becomes still. (TA.) And it is said
in another prov., هُوَ كَالبَاحِثِ عَنِ الجُرَّةِ [He is
like him who searches in the earth for the].
(AHeyth, TA.) In the phrase  إِذَا أَفْلَتَتْ مِنْ جُرَّتَيْهَا ,
in a saying of Ibn-Lisán-el-Hummarah, referring
to sheep, [app. meaning When they escape from
their two states of danger,] by جرّتيها he means
their place of pasture (المَجَرّ) in a severe season
[when they are liable to perish], and when they

prey: so says ISk: Az says that he calls their

perish. (TA.)

again, (K,) or chews, or ruminates, (Az, IAth,
Msb,) or to chew, or ruminate; (S;) as also
↓ جَرَّةٌ: (K:) it is said to belong to the same
predicament as بَعْر. (Mgh.) Hence the saying,
لَا أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ مَا اخْتَلَفَتِ الدِّرَّةُ وَالجِرَّةُ I will not
do that as long as the flow of milk and the cud go
[the former] downwards and [the latter] upwards.
(S, A. * [See also دِرَّةٌ.]) And اُجْتُلِبَتِ الدِّرَّةُ بِالجِرَّةِ
[The flow of milk was procured by the cud]:
alluding to the beasts' becoming full of food, and
then lying down and not ceasing to ruminate
until the time of milking. (IAar, TA.) And

called الصَّيْف (المَصَايِيف): and only those do so
that are red [or brown], and such as are of a
white hue intermixed with red (الصُّهْب), and
such as are ash-coloured: never, or scarcely ever,
such as are of a dark gray colour without any
admixture of white, because of the thickness of
their skins, and the narrowness of their insides,
and the hardness of their flesh. (IAar, TA. [See
also 1: and see خَصُوفٌ.]) ―
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A she-camel
