جَدَعَ, (Msb,)
inf. n. جَدْعٌ, (S, Msb, K,) He cut off the nose;
and in like manner, the ear; and the hand, or
arm; and the lip; (S, Msb, K;) and a similar
part: (TA:) and أَنْفَهُ ↓ أَجْدَعْتُ signifies the same
as جَدَعْتُ [I cut off his nose]: or جَدْعٌ signifies
[absolutely] the cutting off; or cutting so as to
separate. (TA.) In the following saying of a
poet, the verb is used metaphorically,
وَأَصْبَحَ الدَّهْرُ ذُو العِرْنِينِ قَدْ جُدِعَا
[lit. And nosed fortune became mutilated in the
nose; meaning, (assumed tropical:) became marred]. (TA.) And in
the following phrase, occurring in a verse, كَأَنَّ اللّٰهَ
يَجْدَعُ أَنْفَهُ وَعَيْنَيْهِ, the poet means, [As though
God cut off his nose] and put out his eyes: see a

is good, to cleave to him]: (K:) said in imprecating a curse upon a man: similar to عَقْرًا لَهُ,
q. v.: the first word being governed in the accus.
case by a verb understood. (TA.) One says also,
اِجْدَعْهُمْ بِالأَمْرِ حَتَّى يَذِلُّوا, a phrase mentioned by
IAar, but not explained by him; thought by ISd
to mean, (tropical:) Act thou, in commanding, as though
thou mutilatedst them by cutting off their noses
[until they become submissive]. (TA.) In the
phrase ↓ صَوْتُ الحِمَارِ اليُجَدَّعُ [The voice of the
ass that has his ear, or ears, cut off, (see مُجَدَّعٌ,
below,)], occurring in a verse of Dhu-l-Khirak
Et-Tuhawee, (S,) accord. to J, but not found by
Sgh in the verses of that poet, and said to be in
the Book [of Sb], though IB denies this, asserting
it to be in the Nawádir of AZ, (TA,) Akh says,
the poet means الَّذِى يُجَدَّعُ, like as you say,
هُوَالْيَضْرِبُكَ, meaning الَّذِى يَضْرِبُكَ: Aboo-Bekr
Ibn-es-Sarráj says, the poet, requiring refa for the
rhyme, has changed the noun into a verb; and
this is one of the worst of poetic licences. (S.)
