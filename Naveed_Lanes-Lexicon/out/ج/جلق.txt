جلقجَوَالِقُ (S, M, MA, Mgh, K) and جُوَالِقٌ (IAar,
M, K) and جِوَالِقٌ (K) A sack; in Pers. جُوَالْ;
(MA, PS;) [not so well rendered in the KL by
خُرْجِينْ, which means a saddle-bag or a pair of
saddle-bags, like the Arabic خُرْجٌ;] a certain kind
of وِعَآءِ [or receptacle], (S, M, K,) [for corn &c.,]
well known: (M, K:) it has a loop, into which
is inserted a stick, or piece of wood, called شِظَاظٌ,
(S and K in art. شظ,) this being also inserted into
the loop of another جوالق, when they are bound
upon the camel: (K * and TA in that art.:) or it
has two loops, one of which is inserted into the
other, (S and K voce قَطَبَ,) [and then the stick
is put through,] on the occasion of putting it on a
camel: (TA ibid.:) the word is arabicized; (M,
TA;) said to be from كواله, (TA,) or كوالك,
(KL,) but correctly from چواله, which is Pers.:
(TA:) the pl. is جَوَالِقُ (S, MA, Mgh, K) and
جَوَالِيقُ, (Sb, S, MA, Mgh, K,) the latter occurring
in poetry, (TA,) and جُوَالِقَاتٌ (S, K) was sometimes used, (S,) but this is disallowed by Sb. (S,
M.) The saying [of a rájiz], cited by Th,
أُحِبُّ مَاوِيَّةَ حُبًّا صَادِقَا
حُبَّ أَبِى الجُوَالِقِ الجُوَالِقَا
[I love Máweeyeh with a true love; with the
love of the owner (lit. father) of the sack for the
sack;] means that the speaker had a vehement
love for the food, or wheat, that was in his جوالق.
(M.) Another says,
يَا حَبَّذَا مَا فِى الجَوَالِيقِ السُّودْ
مِنْ خُشْكَنَانِ وَسَوِيقٍ مَقْنُودْ
[O, lovely is what is in the black sacks, of biscuit
and meal of parched barley sweetened with sugarcandy !]. (S.)
