another noun as it is in the second of the two
examples here following,] it is with fet-h: thus
one says, مَا سَمِعْتُ لَهُ جَرْسًا; (A, K;) i. e., I

bell called] جُلْجُل: (TA:) and also that which
is struck [to make it sound]: (Lth, S, K:) the
thing that is struck by the Christians at the times

Msb.) It is said in a trad., لَا تَصْحَبُ المَلَائِكَةُ
رُفْقَةً فِيهَا جَرَسٌ [The angels will not accompany an
assemblage of persons journeying together among
whom is a bell]: (S, TA:) the reason is said to
be, because it guides others to them; for Mo-
hammad liked not to let the enemy know of his
approach until he came upon them suddenly.
