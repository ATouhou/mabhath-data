of it; cut a piece out of the middle of it; hollowed
it out; or excavated it. (TA.) You say, جاب
الصَّخْرَةَ He made a hole in the rock; (A, TA;)
perforated, pierced, or bored, it. (TA.) Hence,
in the Kur [lxxxix. 8], وَثَمُودَ الَّذِينَ جَابُوا الصَّخْرَ
بِالوَادِ (Fr, S, TA) And Thamood, who made holes
in the rocks, (Fr, TA,) or cut the rocks, (Bd,
Jel,) [or hollowed them out,] and made them
dwellings, in the valley, (Fr, Bd, Jel, TA,) i. e.,
in Wádi-l-Kurà. (Bd, Jel.) You say also, جاب
القَمِيصَ, (S, A, K,) aor. بَجُوبُ, [inf. n. جَوْبٌ;]
(S, K, and Msb in art. جيب;) and aor. يَجِيبُ,
(S, K,) [inf. n., app., جِيبٌ, originally جَوْبٌ; see
a verse cited below, and a remark of Sh thereon;]
and ↓ جوّبهُ; (A, K;) He hollowed out, or cut
out in a round form, the جَيْب of the shirt: (S,
and Msb in art. جيب:) or he cut the جَيْب of
the shirt: (A:) or he made a جَيْب to the shirt;

-b2-  [Hence, also,] جاب, (S, A,
Msb, TA,) aor. يَجُوبُ (S, Msb, TA) and يَجِيبُ,
(S, TA,) inf. n. جَوْبٌ; (TA;) and ↓ اجتاب; (S,
A, TA;) (tropical:)  He traversed, or crossed, (S, A, * Msb,
TA,) or cut through by journeying, (TA,) a

likewise the pouncing down of a bird. (TA.) A
rájiz says,
بَاتَتْ تَجِيبُ أَدْعَجَ الظَّلَامِ
جِيبَ البِيَطْرِ مِدْرَعَ الهُمَامِ
(assumed tropical:)  [She passed the night cutting through the black
darkness, like as the tailor cuts through the woollen
tunic of the valiant chief, making the opening at
the neck and bosom]: (S: [but in one copy, instead of جِيبَ, I here find جَيْبَ; and in art. بطر,
شَقَّ:]) and Sh remarks that this [verb تجيب, or
the inf. n. جيب,] is not from الجَيْبُ [meaning
“ the opening at the neck and bosom ” of a shirt
&c.], because its medial radical is و, and that of
الجيب is ى: (TA:) [i. e., جاب, aor. يجيب, is
originally جَوَبَ, aor. يَجْوِبُ.] One says also, of
news, يَجُوبُ الأَرْضَ مِنْ بَلَدٍ إِلَى بَلَدٍ (assumed tropical:)  [It traverses
the earth from country to country, or the land
from town to town]. (S, TA.) And of proverbs,
تَجُوبُ البِلَادَ (assumed tropical:)  They are current in the countries,
or towns. (TA.) ―
-b3-  It is said in a trad., جِيبَتِ
العَرَبُ عَنَّا كَمَا جِيبَتِ الرَّحَا عَنْ قُطْبِهَا (assumed tropical:)  The Arabs
were rent from us, like as the mill-stone is rent
from its pivot; we being in the midst, and they
around us. (TA.)

so accord. to an explanation of the act. part. n.)
3

S, TA,) like طَاعَةٌ and طَاقَةٌ, (S, A,) used in the
place of an inf. n.; (AHeyth, TA;) and ↓ استجابهُ
(A, K, TA) and ↓ اِسْتَجُوَبَهُ and لَهُ ↓ اِستجاب;

(S, TA;) He answered him, replied to him,
responded to him, (Msb, TA,) either affirmatively
or negatively. (Msb.) And اجاب قَوْلَهُ He answered,
or replied to, his saying. (Msb.) And اجاب عَنْ
سُؤَالِهِ (S, TA) He answered, or replied to, his
question. (TA.) And اجاب دُعَآءَهُ, (Msb, TA, *)
and دُعَآءَهُ ↓ استجاب, (S, A, TA,) and لَهُ ↓ استجاب,
(Msb,) and مِنْهُ ↓ استجاب, (Har p. 307,) said of
God, (S, A, Msb, TA,) [He answered his prayer;;]
He accepted his prayer; (Msb;) He recompensed
his prayer by gift and acceptance. (TA.) It is
said in the Kur [ii. 182], أُجِيبُ دَعْوةَ الدَّاعِى إِذَا
لِى ↓ دَعَانِ فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا [I answer the prayer of
him who prayeth to me;] therefore let them
answer me; (TA;) i. e., let them answer my call
by obedience, (Jel,) when I call them to belief
and obedience: (Bd:) accord. to Fr, what is
here meant [by the last verb] is تَلْبِيَة [q. v. in
art. لبى]: (TA:) [or let them give me their
assent, or consent, to my call; or let them obey
my call: for you say, اجابهُ إِلَى شَىْءٍ and عَلَى شَىْءٍ,

for and answering the call. (Har p. 71.)
-A2-  The
forms أَجْوَبَ and أَجْوِبْ [as verbs of wonder] are
not used: therefore you say, مَا أَجْوَدَ جَوَابَهُ and
أَجْوِدْ بِجَوَابِهِ [How good is his answer, or reply!];
not مَا أَجْوَبَهُ nor أَجْوِبْ بِهِ: nor do you say, هُوَ
أَجْوَبُ مِنْكَ [meaning He is better in answering,
or replying, than thou: but see أَجْوَبُ, below].

disputation, or debate, together; bandied words, one
with another]: (K:) ↓ مُجَاوَبَةٌ and تَجَاوُبٌ both

-A2-  انجابت She (a camel) stretched forth her
neck, to be milked; (K;) as though she complied
with the desire of her milker to be restrained [for

a verb of this measure from أَجَابَ. (TA.)
8
اجتاب: see 1, in three places. ―

جَابَةٌ is an inf. n. of أَجَابَ, (Kr, TA,) or a
simple subst. (A Heyth, S, TA) used in the place

أَسَآءَ سَمْعًا فَأَسَآءَ جَابَةً [He heard ill, and therefore
answered ill]: (S, A, K:) a prov., and therefore
not to be rehearsed otherwise than in the original
way, as above: [not to be altered by the substitution of إِجَابَةٌ or إِجَابًا for جَابَةً:] its origin is said
to have been this: Sahl [or Suheyl] Ibn-' Amr
had an insane son; and a man said to him, أَيْنَ
أَمُّكَ, i. e. “ Whither is thy tending? ” to which
he (thinking that he said, أَيْنَ أُمُّكَ [“ Where is
thy mother ! ”],) answered, “She is gone to buy

(Msb, TA, *) to a letter, or writing, and to a
saying, or question; and this is either affirmative
or negative: (Msb:) [accord. to some, it is only
after a question or demand; but this is not correct; for it is often a reply to an affirmation:]
↓ جِيبَةٌ [q. v.] is syn. therewith; (S, K;) and so
are ↓ جَابَةٌ [q. v.] and ↓ مَجُوبَةٌ: (K:) the pl. of
جواب is أَجْوِبَةٌ and جَوَابَاتٌ (Msb.) [Hence, in
grammar, حَرْفُ جَوَابٍ A responsive, or replicative,

أَجْوَبُ, [see 4,] in the following question, put
to Mohammad, (TA,) أَىُّاللَّيْلِ أَجْوَبُ دَعْوَةً is
either from جُبْتُ الأَرْضَ (K, TA) “ I traversed
the land,” (TA,) and signifies (tropical:)  More, or most,
penetrating to the places whence the answer is
imagined to proceed; (K, TA;) or [it signifies
more, or most, quick in being answered,] from
الدَّعْوَةُ ↓ جَابَتِ, of the measure فَعُلَت, [i. e.,
originally جَوُبَت,] “ the prayer became answered,”
which, however, is a verb not in use, like as
فَقِيرٌ and شَدِيدٌ are imagined to be derived from
فَقُرَ and شَدُدَ: (Z, TA:) or it signifies more, or
most, quick of answer, [from أَجَابَ,] and is [anomalous, and] similar to أَطْوَعُ [“ more obedient ”],
from الطَّاعَةُ, [i. e. from أَطَاعَ “ he obeyed,”] (M,
L, TA,) and to أَعْطَى [“ more, or most, excellent
in giving,” from أَعْطَى “ he gave ”], and لَوَاقِحَ
[pl. of لَاقِحَةٌ a “ fecundating ” wind, (in the Kur
xv. 22,) from أَلْقَحَ “ he, or it, fecundated ”],
(M, L, K, TA,) and the like; (M, L, TA;) and
if so, the word is anomalous because a word of
the measure أَفْعَلُ of this kind is not derived from
a verb of more than three letters, except in certain
cases of deviation from the constant course of
speech: (L, TA:) the meaning is, (tropical:)  What part
of the night is that [in which prayer most quickly
penetrates? or] in which prayer is most quick in
being answered? (Mgh:) or what part of the
night is that in which God is most quick in
answering prayer? (L, TA.)
