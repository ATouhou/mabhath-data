Persian word. (Msb. [See جُزَافٌ, below.]) And
you say, جَزَفَ فِى الكَيْلِ, inf. n. جَزْفٌ, He gave
large measure: (IKtt, Msb:) and جَزَفَ لَهُ فِى

جَزَافٌ: see what next follows, in two places.
جُزَافٌ, accord. to the 'Eyn, in selling and buying,
is [The selling, and buying,] by conjecture, without measuring and without weighing; and by
rule should be ↓ جِزَافٌ, with kesr; i. e., if formed
in accordance to the verb [which is جَازَفَ]: (Mgh:)
or the selling or buying a thing not knowing its
measure nor its weight: (Msb:) or conjecture
in selling and buying; as also ↓ جِزَافٌ and ↓ جَزَافٌ
and ↓ جُزَافَةٌ and ↓ جِزَافَةٌ and ↓ جَزَافَةٌ: (K, TA:)
arabicized, from گُزَافْ, (Msb, K, TA,) which is
Persian: (Msb, TA:) they say لَافْ وگَزَافْ, meaning “ excess in speech, by conjecture: ” accord. to
the Jm, its primary signification is muchness, or
copiousness: (TA:) some say that the most chaste
form of جزاف is ↓ جِزَافٌ, with kesr; [because
this is a regular inf. n. of جَازَفَ;] (MF, TA;)
and some, that the triple vocalization of the ج in
جزاف is a kind of جزاف [i. e. conjecture], since
all assert it to be a Persian word arabicized, and
it cannot be so and be also an inf. n., conformable
to the verb and to rule: it seems that, when
they arabicized it, its original was gradually forgotten, so they formed from it a verb, and derived
from it, and made it analogous. (TA.) ―
