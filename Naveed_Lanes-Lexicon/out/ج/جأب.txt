جأب1
جَأَبَ, aor.
جَاَ^َ, (S, K,) inf. n. جَأْبٌ, (S,) He
gained, earned, or acquired, (S, K,) wealth, or
property: (K:) but [SM says,] I have not seen
that any of the leading lexicologists has mentioned this addition of wealth, or property. (TA.
[See, however, جَأّبٌ, below.]) The rájiz (Ru-beh
Ibn-El-'Ajjáj, TA) says,
وَاللّٰهُ رَاعِى عَمَلِى وَجَأْبِى
[And God is mindful of my work and my earning]. (S, TA.)
-A2-  Also He sold جَأْبِ, i. e. مَغْرَة
[red ochre]; (IAar, K;) and so جَبَأَ. (IAar, TA.)
جَأْبٌ Thick, gross, big, or bulky: (S, K:) or
strong: (A:) applied to an ass, (A, K,) or to a
wild ass: (S, K:) as also جَابٌ, without ء: (S:)
pl. جُؤُوبٌ. (TA.) Accord. to the K [and the
A], it signifies also Whatever is rude, or coarse;
thick, gross, big, or bulky: (كُلُّ جَافٍ غَلِيظٍ:)
but in the L, we find كَاهِلٌ جَأْبٌ غَلِيظٌ [meaning
that جَأْبٌ applied to the part of the back termed
كاهل signifies thick, or big]: and خَلْقٌ جَأْبٌ
as meaning a thick, gross, big, or bulky, make.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] الجَأْبُ The lion. (A, Sgh,
K.) ―
-b3-  And جَأْبَةُ المِدْرَى, (S, A, K,) or, accord. to
AO (S) and the Mj (TA) and Sh, (TA in art.
جوب q. v.,) without ء, (S, TA,) A doe-gazelle
having her horn just come forth; because the
horn when it first comes forth is thick, and afterwards becomes slender; (S, K;) thus showing
her to be young: (S:) or a doe-gazelle, and a
cow, strong in the horn. (A.) [See also art.
