produced an effect, or made an impression, upon
him with a weapon: (L:) he cut him: (A,
MF:) or clave, or rent, some part of his body:
(MF:) syn. كَلَمَهُ: (K:) and ↓ جرّحهُ, (S, K,)
inf. n. تَجْرِيحٌ, (TA,) signifies the same (K) in
an intensive sense, or as applying to several
objects; (S;) or he wounded him much. (L.) ―
-b2-
Also, (K,) or جَرَحَهُ بِلِسَانِهِ, (A, Msb,) inf. n. as
above, (Msb,) [lit. He wounded him with his
tongue; meaning] (tropical:)  he reviled him, or vilified
him; (A, K;) he imputed to him a vice, or
fault, or the like; or spoke against him. (Msb.)
And جَرَحُوهُ بِأَنْيَاب وَأَضْرَاسٍ [lit. They wounded
him with dog-teeth and grinders; meaning] (tropical:)  they
reviled him, or vilified him, and imputed to him
vices or the like. (A.) And hence, (Msb,) جَرَحَ
الشِّاهِدَ (A, L, Msb, K) [and ↓ جرّحهُ, as in many
of the law-books,] said of a judge, (A, L,) or
other person, (I.,) (tropical:)  He annulled the witness's
claim to be legally credible, (L, K,) by happening
to discover in him a falsehood &c.; (L;) he
evinced in the witness something that caused his
testimony to be rejected: (Msb:) he censured the
witness, and rejected what he said. (L.) And
جَرَحَ الرَّجُلَ (tropical:)  He invalidated the man's testimony.
(L.) And جَرَحَ الشَّهَادَةَ (tropical:)  [He, or it, invalidated

TA;) or applied himself with art and diligence

with his hand, and gained, acquired, or earned;
&c.: (Msb:) from جِرَاحَةٌ. (Mgh.) You say,

↓ اجْتَرَحَتْ, (tropical:)  Very evil is that which thy hands
have done, or wrought, or effected: a metaphor
taken from the signification of “cutting,” or
“wounding;” (A, TA;) accord. to El-Khafájee,
a metaphorical meaning conventionally regarded
as proper. (TA.) السَّيَّآتِ ↓ اجْتَرَحُوا, in the Kur

legally credible should be annulled. (A, TA.)
And (tropical:)  It (a tradition, or narrative, A, or a thing,

الأَحَادِيثُ means (tropical:)  These traditions deserved to be
rejected on account of their great number and
the fewness of such as were true: (A:) or, by
reason of their great number, obliged those who
were acquainted with them to annul the claim of
some one or other of their relaters to be credited,
and to reject his relation: (L:) or were corrupt:
(T, S, * TA:) [for] اِسْتِجْرَاحٌ signifies [also] the
being faulty, defective, and corrupt. (S, K.)
One says, قَدْ وَعَظْتُكُمْ فَلَمْ تَزْدَادُوا إِلَّا اسْتِجْرَاحًا:
(S, A:) these words are from a خُطْبَة of ‘AbdEl-Melik; and the meaning is, [I have admonished you and ye have not increased save] in
corrupt conduct: or in what gaineth for you
censure. (TA.)
جَرْحٌ: see the next paragraph.
جُرْحٌ a subst. from جَرَحَ; (S, L, K;) A wound;
(L;) and so ↓ جَرْحٌ, in its original acceptation;
but some of those skilled in the science of lexicology say that the former is employed to denote the
effect produced upon bodies by iron instruments
and the like; and the latter, that produced upon
objects of the mind by the tongue: (MF:) the
pl. of the former is جُرُوحٌ and أَجْرَاحٌ [which is a
pl. of pauc.] (S, L, K) and جِرَاحٌ; (T, A, L;)
but the second of these is of rare occurrence, (K,)
only used in poetry: (S, L:) [respecting the
third, see what follows:] ↓ جِرَاحَةٌ also signifies
the same as جُرْحٌ; (Msb;) and its pl. is جِرَاحٌ
(S, Msb, K) and جِرَاحَاتٌ (A, Msb) and جَرَائِحُ;
(A;) or جِرَاحٌ is a coll. gen. n., of which جِرَاحَةٌ
is the n. un.; or, accord. to Az, this last has not
a sing. sense, as Lth asserts it to have, but is a
pl. of جُرْحٌ, like as حِجَارَةٌ is of حَجَرٌ, and جِمَالَةٌ
of جَمَلٌ, and حِبَالَةٌ of حَبْلٌ. (L.)
جُرْحَةٌ (tropical:)  A thing whereby testimony is invalidated, or its claim to be legally credible annulled:
as in the saying, هَلْ لَكَ جُرْحَةٌ (tropical:)  [Hast thou anything to adduce whereby to invalidate the testimony?]. (A, TA.) أَقْصَصْتُكَ الجُرْحَةَ فَإِنْ كَانَ
عِنْدَكَ مَا تَجْرَحُ بِهِ الحُجَّةَ فَهَلُمَّهَا, said by the judge
of El-Medeeneh to one of the parties in a lawsuit, when about to give judgment against him,
means (tropical:)  I authorize thee to adduce anything
whereby to invalidate the testimony: [therefore,
if thou have anything whereby thou mayest invalidate the allegation, adduce it.] (A, * TA.)
جَرِيحٌ; pl. جَرْحَى; (S, A, Msb, K;) each of
which is mase. and fem.; (S, K;) Wounded.
(Msb.) The pl. is not formed by the addition of
و and ن because the fem. is not formed by the
addition of ة. (TA.)
جِرَاحَةٌ: see جُرْحٌ.
جَرَائِحِىٌّ: see what next follows.
جَرَّاحٌ A surgeon that dresses wounds. (Golius
on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof; and so in the
present day; as also ↓ جَرَائِحِىٌّ.)
جَارِحَةٌ sing. of جَوَارِحُ. (Mgh, L, Msb, TA.)
―
-b2-  The latter signifies (tropical:)  Beasts, and birds, of
prey; or that catch game; (S, A, * Mgh, L, Msb,
K:) thus the falcon is a جارحة, and so is the
dog trained for hunting, because it gains for its
owner: (L:) and this appellation is applied alike
to the male and the female, like رَاحِلَةٌ and رَاوِيَةٌ.
(Msb.) ―
-b3-  And (tropical:)  The members, or limbs, of a
man, with which things are gained or earned;
(S, K, TA;) or with which one works; (A;) as
the hands or arms, and the feet or legs: (S,
A, K, TA:) because they gain, or earn, or do,
good and evil. (TA.) ―
-b4-  [And (tropical:)  The organs
of the body: thus, for instance, جارحة is
applied (in the Msb, art. بصر,) to the eye, which
is termed (in the TA in that art.) the seeing
جارحة (الجَارِحَةُ النَّاظِرَةُ).] ―
-b5-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Mares:
[and the like:] because they bring gain to their
owners by their breeding. (AA, T.) You say,
مَا لَهُ جَارِحَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  He possesses not a female beast that
bears young: he possesses not that which makes
gain. (TA.) And هٰذِهِ النَّاقَةُ مِنْ جَوَارِحِ المَالِ,
and هذه الأَتَانُ, (K,) and هذه الفَرَسُ, (TA,)
(assumed tropical:)  This she-camel, and this she-ass, and this mare,
is young, unimpaired by age (مُقْبِلَةٌ [i. q. مُقْتَبَلَةٌ])
in the womb, (K, TA,) and in youthful vigour,
and one of which the offspring is wished for.
(TA.)
