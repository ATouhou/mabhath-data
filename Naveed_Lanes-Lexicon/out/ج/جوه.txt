جوه1
جَاهَهُ بِالمَكْرُوهِ, (S,) or بِمَكْرُوهٍ, (K,) [aor.
يَجُوهُ,] inf. n. جَوْهٌ, (S,) i. q. جَبَهَهُ بِهِ [He met
him, or encountered him, with, or he said to him,
or did to him, or he accused him, to his face, of,
that which was, or a thing that was, disliked, or
hated]. (S, K.) And [in like manner,] جاههُ بِشَرٍّ
He encountered him with evil [speech or conduct];
or confronted him therewith: whence لَا جِهْتَ,
i. e. Mayest thou not be encountered with evil;
said in chiding a he-camel: see جَاهِ below. (TA.)
A woman of Ghatafán, being chidden by her son,
and being asked why she did not reply against
him, said, أَخَافُ أَنْ يَجُوهَنِى بِأَكْثَرَ مِنْ هٰذَا,
meaning I fear that he would encounter me with
more than this. (JK.)

جوّه and ↓ اجاه are rendered by Golius Ad
dignitatem evexit: spectabilem reddidit: as on
the authority of the S: but in my copies of the S
the two verbs are اوجه and وجّه; and belong to
art. وجه, though mentioned in the present art.]

أَجْوَهَ see 2.]
5
تجوّه He magnified himself; or was, or
became, proud, haughty, or disdainful: or he
affected rank, station, or dignity, not possessing
it. (TA.)
جَاهٌ Rank, station, or dignity, (S, K, TA, and
JK in art. وجه,) with, or in the estimation of, the
Sultán; (JK, TA;) as also ↓ جَاهَةٌ, (K,) on the
authority of Lh, (TA, as from the K, [but not in
my copies,]) or, accord. to Sgh, of Ks.: the
former word [probably arabicized from the Persian جَاهْ; but] said to be formed by transposition
from وَجْهٌ; this being first changed to جَوْهٌ; then,
to جَوَهٌ; and then, to جَاهٌ: or, accord. to Lh, it
is not from وَجْهٌ, but from جُهْت [app. جُهْتُ, first
pers. sing. of جَاهَ, q. v.]; though he does not
explain what is جُهْت. (TA.) You say, فُلَانٌ ذُو
جَاهٍ [Such a one is possessed of rank, station, or
dignity]. (S.) And لِفُلَانٍ جَاهٌ فِيهِمْ To such a
one belongs rank, station, or dignity, among them.
(Aboo-Bekr, TA.) The dim. of جَاهٌ [or of جَاهَةٌ]
is ↓ جُوَيْهَةٌ. (TA.)
-A2-  جَاهِ, indecl., with kesr for
its termination; and, accord. to As, sometimes,
جَاهٍ, with tenween; (S;) or جَاهِ جَاهِ, (JK, K,)
and جَاهٍ جَاهٍ, and جَاهْ جَاهْ, (Lh, K,) and جُوه
↓ جُوه, or جَوْه جَوْه, (accord. to different copies of
the K, but) indecl., with kesr for the termination,
[i. e. جُوهِ جُوهِ, or جَوْهِ جَوْهِ,] mentioned in the
M, (TA,) and ↓ جَاهِ لَا جِهْتَ, (IDrd, TA, [see 1,])
ejaculations used for chiding a he-camel, not a
she-camel: (As, JK, IDrd, S, K:) or one says
to a she-camel, عَاجٍ and جَاهٍ. (A 'Obeyd, TA in
art. عوج: [or perhaps there is an omission here:
I think it more likely that what A 'Obeyd said
was that one says to a she-camel عَاجٍ, and to a
he-camel جَاهٍ.])
جُوهٌ The face, or countenance: syn. وَجْهٌ; as
also جِيهٌ: (Lh, K:) the latter with kesr: (TA:)
so in the saying, نَظَرَ بِجُوهِ سَوْءٍ and بِجِيهِ سَوْءٍ [He
looked with an evil face or countenance]. (Lh,
K.)
