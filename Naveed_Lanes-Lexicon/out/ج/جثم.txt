جُثْمَانٌ The body, with the limbs or members;
syn. جِسْمٌ: and i. q. شَخْصٌ [app. as meaning a
person; not, as J seems to have held, a corporeal,
or material, form or thing or substance, such as
is seen from a distance; see جِسْمٌ]: (K:) or,
accord. to As, it has the latter meaning, i. q.
شَخْصٌ; and جُسْمَانٌ has the former meaning,
that of جِسْمٌ (S, Msb) and جَسَدٌ: (Msb:) or,
accord. to AZ, جُثْمَانٌ is syn. with جُسْمَانٌ, (S,
Msb,) i. e. جَسَدٌ. (S.) One says, مَا أَحْسَنَ
جُثْمَانَ الرَّجُلِ and جُسْمَانَهُ, meaning [How goodly,

(AZ, S.) J cites, as an ex. of this word in the
sense of شخص, from a verse of Bishr,
سَنَامٌ كَجُثْمَانِ البَنِيِّةِ أَتْلَعَا
observing that by البنيّة is meant the Kaabeh:
but IB says that the right reading, as found in
his poetry, is البَلِيَّةِ, and أَتْلَعُ; and that the meaning is, A [long] hump like the جثمان [or body]
of the she-camel that is placed [and confined
without food or water until she dies] at the grave
of a dead man. (TA.) One says also, جَآءَنَا بِثَرِيدٍ
كَجُثْمَانِ المَآءِ [He brought us crumbled bread
moistened with broth and piled up, like the body
of the bird of the kind called قَطًا]. (S.)
جُثْمَانِيَّةُ المَآءِ, as used in the saying of ElFarajeeyeh, (K,) so in the copies of the K, [or
El-Faraheeyeh, accord. to the CK,] but correctly
of El-Farezdak, (TA,)
وَبَاتَتْ بِجُثْمَانِيَّةِ المَآءِ نِيبُهَا
إِلَى ذَاتِ رَحْلٍ كَالْمَآتِمِ حُسَّرَا
means The water itself: or the middle thereof:
or the place where it collected. (K TA.) [The
poet says, And her aged she-camels passed the
night in the water, &c., . . . . like the companies
of mourning women having the head, or the face,
&c., uncovered: but what is meant by الي ذات
رحل, unless it be with one having a saddle upon
her, إِلَى being sometimes used in the sense
of مَعَ I am unable to conjecture. In the CK,
نَيْبَها and كالمٰاثِمِ are erroneously put for نِيبُهَا
and كَالمَآتِمِ.]

hence, in the Kur [xix. 73], وَنَذَرُ الظَّالِمِينَ فِيهَا
جُثِيًّا, and جِثِيًّا also, with kesr to the ج because
of the kesr of the letter following it, [And we
