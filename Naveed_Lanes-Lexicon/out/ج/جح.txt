جحR. Q. 1
جَحْجَحَ He mentioned a جَحْجَاح
[or chief, &c.] of his people. (TA.) ―
-b2-  جَحْجَحَتْ
She gave birth to a جحجاج. (TA.) And
جحجحت بِوَلَدِهَا She brought forth her child a
جحجاح. (A.)
جَحْجَحٌ: see the following paragraph. ―
-b2-  Also
A low, an ignoble, a vile, a mean, or a sordid,
man; possessing no manly qualities. (AA, T,
K.) [Thus it bears two contr. significations.]
جَحْجَاحٌ (S, A, K) and ↓ جَحْجَحٌ (K) A chief,
lord, master, or man of rank or quality or distinction: (S, A, K:) or one who is liberal, bountiful, or munificent; or one who is noble, or
generous: (TA:) and one who hastens [to render
aid] in cases of evil: (A:) pl. (of the former,
S, A, TA, [or of the latter accord. to analogy,])
جَحَاجِحُ (S, A, K) and (of the same, A, TA)
جَحَاجِحَةٌ (A, K) and جَحَاجِيحُ: (K:) it is said
in the S that these two are pls. of the first pl.;
the ة in the former of them being substituted for
the ى in the latter of them, which is rejected;
for one of these two letters must be retained, but
both cannot be together: this assertion in the S,
however, is well refuted by MF. (TA.)
