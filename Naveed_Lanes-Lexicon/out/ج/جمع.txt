Thus in the Kur [civ. 2], الَّذِى جَمَّعَ مَالًا وَعَدَّدَهُ

hath made it a provision for the casualties of
fortune, or reckoned it time after time: (Bd:)
[or who hath amassed, or accumulated, wealth,
&c.:] or who hath gained, acquired, or earned,
wealth, &c.; thus differing from جَمَعَ, explained
above: but it is allowable to say مَالًا ↓ جَمَعَ,
without teshdeed; (Fr;) and thus it is [generally]
read in this passage of the Kur. (Bd.) See also 1.

اجمع: see 1. أَجْمَعْتُ الشَّىْءَ signifies I put
the thing together; such, for instance, as spoil,
or plunder. (S.) You say, أَجْمَعْتُ النَّهْبِ, meaning I collected together from every quarter the
camels taken as spoil from the people to whom
they belonged, and drove them away: (AHeyth:)
or إِجْمَاعٌ signifies [simply] the driving of camels
together, or collectively. (K.) ―
-b2-  الإِجْمَاعُ also
signifies The composing and settling a thing which
has been discomposed [and unsettled]; as an
opinion upon which one determines, resolves, or
decides: (TA:) or جَعْلُ الأَمْرِ جَمِيعًا بَعْدَ تَفَرُّقِهِ,
(AHeyth, K,) i. e. the determining, resolving,
or deciding, upon an affair, so as to make it
firmly settled, [after it had been unsettled in
the mind, or] after considering what might be its
issues, or results, and saying at one time, I will
do thus, and at another time, I will do thus.
(AHeyth.) You say, أَجْمَعْتُ الأَمْرَ, (Ks, S, Mgh, *
Msb, K,) and عَلَى الأَمْرِ, (Mgh, * Msb, K,) I
determined, resolved, or decided, upon the affair;
(Ks, S, Mgh, * Msb, K;) as though I collected
myself, or my mind, for it; (TA;) as, for instance, a journeying, and a fasting, (Mgh, Msb,)
and a going forth, and a tarrying or an abiding;
(TA;) and in like manner, أَمْرَهُ ↓ جَمَعَ He determined, resolved, or decided, upon his affair; as,
for instance, a fasting: (TA:) and أَجْمَعْتُ الرَّأْىِ
I determined, or settled, the opinion. (TA.) You
say also, أَجْمِعْ أَمْرَكَ وَلَا تَدَعْهُ مُنْتَشِرًا [Determine
thou, or decide, upon thine affair, and do not
leave it unsettled]. (S.) The saying, in the Kur
[x. 72], فَأَجْمَعُوا أَمْرَكُمْ وَشُرَكَآءَ كُمْ means Then
determine ye, or resolve, or decide, upon your
affair, (Fr, Ibn-'Arafeh, Bd,) and prepare for
it, (Fr,) or اِجْعَلُوهُ جَمِيعًا, [which has the former
of these meanings, as shown above,] (AHeyth,)
and call ye your companions, (Fr, S, Bd, K,)
شركاءكم being governed in the accus. case by
the verb understood, (Bd, TA,) becanse the verb
in the text is not used with شركاء for its object,
(S, K,) but only the unaugmented verb: (S:) or
the meaning is then determine ye, with your companions, upon your affair; (Bd, K;) so says
Aboo-Is-hák, adding that what Fr says is erroneous: (TA:) or then determine ye upon your
affair and the affair of your companions, for وَأَمْرَ
شُرَكَائِكُمْ. (Bd.) It is also said that the phrase,
in the Kur [xx. 67], فَأَجْمِعُوا كَيْدَكُمْ means
Therefore determine ye, or resolve, or decide,
upon your artifice, or stratagem: (TA:) but
some read كَيْدَكُمْ ↓ فَاجْمَعُوا, (Bd, TA,) meaning
therefore combine ye all your artifice; leave
nothing thereof unexerted; (TA;) and this latter
reading is favoured by the phrase كَيْدَهُ ↓ فَجَمَع
[in verse 62 of the same ch.]. (Bd.) ―
-b3-  Also The
agreeing, or uniting, in opinion. (K, * TA.) You
say, أَجْمَعُوا عَلَى الأَمْرِ meaning They agreed, or

and عليه ↓ تجمّعوا.] ―
-b4-  Also The preparing [a
thing], or making [it] ready; syn. الإِعْدَادُ. (K,
TA. [In the CK, erroneously, الاَعْدَادُ.]) You
say, أَجْمَعْتُ كَذَا I prepared, or made ready,
such a thing. (TA.) And أَجْمِعُوا أَمْرَكُمْ Prepare
ye for your affair. (Fr.) ―
-b5-  Also The binding
the teats of a she-camel all together with the صِرَار,
q. v. (K.) You say, اجمع بِالنَّاقَةِ, (S, TA,) and
اجمع النَّاقَةِ, (TA,) He so bound the teats of the
she-camel; (S, TA;) and so أَكْمَشَ بِهَا. (TA.)
―
-b6-  Also The drying [a thing]; drying [it] up;
making [it] dry; syn. التَّجْفِيفُ وَالإِيبَاسُ. (K
TA. [In the CK, erroneously, التَخْفُيفُ والاِيْناسُ.])
Hence the saying of Aboo-Wejzeh Es-Saadee,
وَأَجْمَعَتِ الهَوَاجِرُ كُلَّ رَجْعٍ
مِنَ الأَجْمَادِ وَالدَّمِثِ البَثَآءِ
i.e. [And the vehement mid-day-heats] dried up
every pool left by a torrent [of the hard and
elevated grounds and of the soft and even ground].
(TA.) ―
-b7-  اجمع المَطَرُ الأَرْضِ The rain made the
whole of the land, both its soft tracts and its hard
tracts, to flow: (K:) and in like manner you

in every part]. (TA.) [See also 10.]

state, S, and a number of men, Msb, [and a
number of things,]) became collected, brought
together, gathered together, gathered up, assembled, congregated, mustered, drawn together, or
contracted; or it collected, collected itself together,
gathered itself together, came together, assembled,
congregated, drew itself together, contracted itself; coalesced; combined; (K, TA;) so that the
several parts or portions became near [or close]
together; (TA;) as also اِجْدَمَعَ, (K,) with د
[substituted for the ت]; (TA;) and ↓ تجمّع and
↓ استجمع signify the same: (Msb, K:) and ↓ تجمّعوا
signifies they became collected, &c., [from several
places, or] hence and thence. (S, K:) [See also 10.]
You say also, اجتمع مَعَهُ (Mgh) and بِهِ (Msb)
[meaning He was, or became, in company with
him; came together with him; met with him; met
him; had a meeting, or an interview, with him].
And اجتمع مَعَهُ عَلَى أَمْرِ كَذَا: (S, K:) see 3,
first sentence: and see the sentence there next
following. And in like manner, عَلَى ↓ تجمّعوا
فُلَانٍ They combined, conspired, or leagued, together
against such a one. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA in art. ضفر.)

You also say, اِجْتَمَعَتِ آرَاؤُهُمْ عَلَى الأَمْرِ [Their

اِجْتَمَعَتْ شَرَائِطُ الإِمَامَةِ The conditions of the office
of Imám occurred together [or were combined, or
they coexisted, in such a case]; as also ↓ اِسْتَجْمَعَتْ.

authority.]) [See a similar ex. voce ارتفع.] ―

[He, or it, was, or became, compact in make or
frame, compressed, contracted, or the like. ―

speaking of a woman. (S, TA.) ―

اجتمع فِى الحَاجَةِ [He was quick and vigorous
in executing the needful affair, or in accomplishing that which was wanted; as though he compacted his frame, and collected all his energy:

demanded, the collecting together of every body of
soldiers; or he summoned together every body of
soldiers]: said of him who demands, or summons,
armies, or military forces. (S, TA.) [But this
usage of the verb is perhaps post-classical: for
Mtr says,] With respect to the saying of ElAbeewardee,
شَآمِيَّةٌ تَسْتَجْمِعُ الشَّوْلَ حَرْجَفُ
[A north wind, cold and vehement, inviting to
collect themselves together the she-camels whose
milk has dried up, they having passed seven or
eight months since bringing forth, or since pregnancy], it seems that he has compared this verb
with the generality of others of the same class,
[and so derived the meaning in which he has
here used it,] or that he heard it [in that sense]
from the people of the cities, or towns, or villages,
and cultivated lands. (Mgh.)
-A2-  استجمع used
intransitively is syn. with اجتمع, which see in
two places, and تجمّع. (Msb, K.) ―

استجمع الفَرَسُ جَرْيًا (S, Mgh, K) The horse

as a specificative. (Mgh.) You say also, اِسْتَجْمَعُوا
لَهُمْ, meaning They exerted [all] their strength,
force, or energy, for fighting them: and hence,
لَكُمْ ↓ إِنَّ النَّاسِ قَدْ جَمَعُوا [app. meaning Verily
the men, or people, have exerted all their strength
for fighting you]. (A, TA.) ―
-b6-  استجمع القَوْمُ

[between 'Arafát and Minè]; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;)
determinate, like عَرَفَاتُ: (TA:) so called because
people collect themselves there; (S, Msb;) or
because Adam there met with Eve (Mgh, Msb)
after they had fallen [from Paradise]: (TA:)
[or, app., a name of the tract from 'Arafát to
Minè inclusive of these two places: and hence,]
يَوْمُ جَمْعٍ the day of 'Arafeh [when the pilgrims
halt at Mount 'Arafát]: and أَيَّامُ جَمْعٍ the days
of Minè. (IDrd, K.) ―
-b3-  As an inf. n. used as a
subst., properly so termed, (S, * Mgh, Msb,) it
also signifies A collection; a number together;
an assembly; a company, troop, congregated or
collective body, party, or group; a mass; syn.
↓ جَمَاعَةٌ, (S, Mgh, L, Msb, K,) of men; (S, L,
K;) as also ↓ مَجْمَعٌ (L, Msb, TA) and ↓ مَجْمِعٌ
(Msb) and ↓ مَجْمَعَةٌ (L, TA) and ↓ جَمِيعٌ: (O,
K:) but ↓ جَمَاعَةٌ is also used as signifying a
collection, a number together, or an assemblage,
of other things than men; [of beasts, as camels,
horses and the like, bulls and cows, and antelopes,
gazelles, &c., i. e. a herd, troop, or drove; of
dogs, i. e. a pack; of sheep and goats, i. e. a
flock; of birds, i. e. a flock or bevy; of bees,

consisting of many and of few; (Msb;) [as also
↓ مَجْمُوعٌ and ↓ مَجْمَعٌ;] a number, a plurality,
and a multitude, of any things: (TA:) the pl.
of جَمْعٌ is جُمُوعٌ. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.) ―
-b4-  And
particularly, An army; a military force; (TA;)
as also ↓ جَمِيعٌ. (S, K.) Whence the phrase, in
a trad., لَهُ سَهْمٌ جَمْعٌ, [or, more probably, سَهْمُ
جَمْعٍ,] meaning For him or shall be, the like
of an army's share of the spoil. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Also
The plural of a thing [or word; i. e. a proper
plural, according to the grammarians; and also
applied by the lexicologists to a quasi-plural
noun, which the grammarians distinguish by the
terms اِسْمُ جَمْعٍ and جَمْعٌ لُغَوِىٌّ]; and so ↓ جِمَاعٌ,
(S, K,) and ↓ جَمِيعٌ, except that this last is what
is termed اِسْمٌ لَازِمٌ [app. meaning a subst. which
does not govern another as its complement in the
gen. case like as جَمْعٌ and جِمَاعٌ do, being thus
likened to what is termed فِعْلٌ لَازِمٌ, i. e. an intransitive verb; so that you say of الخِبَآءُ, for
instance, الجَمِيعُ الأَخْبِيَةُ the plural is الاخبية;
for in this manner I always find it used when it
has this signification, which is frequently the case
in several of the older lexicons, and in some
others; not جَمِيعُ الخِبَآءِ الأَخْبِيَةُ]; (TA;) [whereas] you say, [جَمْعُ الخِبَآءِ الأَخْبِيَةُ and] ↓ جِمَاعُ
الخِبَآءِ الأَخْبِيَةُ, (S, K,) i. e. the جَمْع [or plural]
of الخباء is الخِبَآءِ; (K) for ↓ الجِمَاعُ is what
comprises a number [of things]. (S, K.) See
also this last word below. ―
-b6-  And see also the
next paragraph, in three places. ―
-b7-  The worst
sort of dates; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) because they
are collected together and mixed, (Mgh, Msb,)

[any] bad dates: (Mgh, * Msb:) or a certain
kind of dates (K, TA) mixed together, of several
sorts, not in request, and not mixed but for their
badness: (TA:) or it signifies, (Mgh, K,) or signifies also, (S, Msb,) palm-trees (As, S, Mgh,
Msb, K) of any kind, (As, Mgh, Msb,) growing
from the date-stones, (S, K,) of which the name
is unknown. (As, S, Mgh, Msb, K.) ―

with my fist. (S, Msb. *) And ضَرَبُوهُ بِأَجْمَاعِهِمْ
They beat him, or struck him, with their [clinched]
hands. (TA.) And جَآءَ فُلَانٌ بِقُبْضَةٍ مِلْءٍ جُمْعِهِ
Such a one came with a quantity in his grasp as
much as filled his clinched hand. (S, TA.) And
جُمْعُ الكَفِّ signifies [also] The quantity that a
hand grasps, of money &c. (Ham p. 778.) ―
-b2-
أَخَذْتُ فُلَانًا بِجُمْعِ ثِيَابِهِ, (S, Msb, *) and ↓ بِجَمْعِ
ثِيَابِهِ, (Msb,) i. e. [I took, or seized, such a one]

yet a virgin. (TA.) And مَاتَتْ بِجُمْعٍ, (S, Mgh,
Msb, K,) and ↓ بِجِمْعٍ, (Ks, S, Msb, K,) and
↓ بِجَمْعٍ, (K,) She died a virgin: (Mgh, Msb,
K:) or it signifies, (S, K,) or signifies also,
(Mgh, Msb,) she died being with child; (AZ, S,
Mgh, Msb, K;) whether suffering the pains of
parturition or not: (AZ:) or heavy with child:
(K:) occurring in the first sense, (Mgh, TA,)
or, as some say, in the last, (TA,) in a trad., in
which it is said that a woman who so dies is a
martyr: (Mgh, TA:) it properly signifies she
died with something comprised in her, not separated from her, whether it were a burden in the
womb, or her maidenhead: (Sgh:) [the pl. is
أَجْمَاعٌ; for] you say, مَاتَتِ النِّسَآءُ بِأَجْمَاعٍ The
women died [being virgins: or] being with child.
(AZ.) You say also, نَاقَةٌ جُمْعٌ A she-camel with

جُمَعٌ pl. of جَمْعَآءُ, fem. of أَجْمَعُ [q. v.].

[May God make permanent the state of union,
&c., subsisting between you two]. (Aboo-Sa'eed,

-b2-  Hence, (Mgh,) يَوْمُ الجُمْعَةِ, (S, Mgh,
Msb, K,) the original form, (TA,) of the dial. of
'Okeyl; (Msb, TA;) and يَوْمُ الجُمُعَةِ, (S, Msb,
K,) the most chaste form, (TA,) of the dial. of
El-Hijáz; (Msb, TA;) and يَوْمُ الجُمَعَةِ, (Msb,

alone; (Mgh;) A well-known day; (K;) [the
day of the congregation; i. e. Friday;] formerly
called (TA) the day of العَرُوبَة: (S, TA:) called
يوم الجمعة because of the congregating of the

who named it thus was Kaab Ibn-Lu-eí; and he
is related to have said that it was thus called
because Kureysh used to gather themselves together to Kuseí, [on that day,] in [the building
called] دَارُ النَّدْوَةِ: (TA:) accord. to the R, Kaab
Ibn-Lu-eí was the first who collected a congregation on the day of العروبة, which was not called
الجمعة save since the coming of El-Islám; [or it
was not generally thus called before El-Islám;
for it is added,] and he was the first who named
it الجمعة; for Kureysh used to congregate to
him on this day, and he used to preach to them,
and to put them in mind of the mission of the
apostle of God, informing them that he should be
of his descendants, and bidding them to follow
him and to believe in him: (TA:) or, as some
say, it was thus called in the time of El-Islám
because of their congregating [thereon] in the
mosque: accord. to a trad., the Ansár named it
thus, because of their congregating thereon:
(TA:) or it was thus named because God collected
thereon the materials of which Adam was created:
(I 'Ab:) those who say الجُمَعَةُ regard it as an
epithet, meaning that this day collects men much;
comparing it to هُمَزَةٌ and لُمَزَةٌ and ضُحَكَةٌ: (TA:)
the pl. is جُمَعٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and جُمْعَاتٌ
(Msb, K) and جُمُعَاتٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and
جُمَعَاتٌ; (Msb, K;) of which the last is pl. of
جُمَعَةٌ, [as well as of جُمْعَةٌ, accord. to analogy,]
but not so جُمَعٌ (AHát) [nor either of the other
pls. mentioned above]. ―
-b3-  In like manner you
say صَلَاةٌ الجُمْعَةِ [The prayer of Friday], and,
in consequence of the frequency of usage, الجُمْعَةُ
alone. (Mgh.) ―
-b4-  الجُمْعَةُ, with the م quiescent,
is also a name for [The week; i. e.] the days of
the week [collectively]; of which the Arabs are
said, by IAar, to have reckoned the Sabbath
(السَّبْت [i. e. Saturday]) as the first, though they
called Sunday the first of the days. (Msb.) ―
-b5-
جُمْعَةٌ is also syn. with مَجْمُوعَةٌ [meaning Things
collected together; or a collection of things];
(K;) as in the phrase جُمْعَةٌ مِنْ حَصًى [a collection of pebbles]. (TA.) ―
-b6-  You say also جُمْعَةٌ
مِنْ تَمْرٍ, meaning A handful of dates. (S, K.)
[
جَمْعِىٌّ Of, or relating to, a plural.]
جُمَعِىٌّ One who fasts on Friday by himself.
(IAar, Th.)
جِمَاعٌ: see جَمْعٌ as signifying “ a plural,” in
three places. [The primary signification seems to
be the last there mentioned; where it is said,]
الجِمَاعُ is What comprises a number [of things]:
(S, K:) one says, الخَمْرُ جِمَاعُ الإِثْمِ (S, TA) [i. e.
Wine is what comprises a number of sins: or]
that in which sin is comprised, and known to be:
the saying is a trad.: (TA:) or جِمَاعُ الإِثْمِ signifies the plurality (جَمْع) of sins. (Msb.) Hence
also the saying of El-Hasan El-Basree, اِتَّقُوا هٰذِهِ
الأَهْوَآءَ فَإِنَّ جِمَاعَهَا الضَّلَالَةُ وَمَعَادَهَا النَّارُ [Beware ye
of these natural desires; for what they involve is
error, and the place to which they lead is the fire
of Hell]. (TA: in the L, وميعادها.) And it is
said in a trad., حَدِّثْنِى بِكَلِمَةٍ تَكُونُ جِمَاعًا i. e. Tell
me a saying comprising [virtually] a plurality of
sayings. (TA.) [See a similar phrase below,
voce جَامِعٌ.] ―
-b2-  [Hence also,] بُرْمَةٌ جِمَاعٌ A stonecooking-pot of the largest size: (Ks, L:) or قِدْرٌ
جِمَاعٌ, and ↓ جَامِعَةٌ, (S, K, TA,) a cooking-pot
that comprises a slaughtered camel; or, accord.
to the A, that comprises a sheep or goat: (TA:)
or a great cooking-pot; (S, K;) as also ↓ جَامِعٌ:
(Sgh, K:) pl. [most probably of this last] جُمْعٌ
[like as بُزْلٌ is pl. of بَازِلٌ, &c.]. (K.) ―
-b3-  You
say also, فُلَانٌ جِمَاعٌ لِبَنِى فُلَانٍ Such a one is an
object of resort for his counsel and authority to
the sons of such a one. (TA.)
-A2-  [See also 3.]
جَمُوعٌ: see جَمَّاعٌ.
جَمِيعٌ In a state of collection, congregation, or
union; being together; met together; [as also
↓ مُجْتَمِعٌ;] contr. of مُتَفَرِّقٌ. (S, K.) You say
قَوْمٌ جَمِيعٌ A people, or number of men, in a state
of collection, &c.; being together; met together;
syn. ↓ مُجْتَمِعُونَ: (TA:) and in like manner,
↓ إِبِلٌ جَمَّاعَةٌ Camels in a state of collection; &c.
(TA.) ―

thing.] See أَجْمَعُ, last sentence. ―

met together; syn. ↓ حَىٌّ مُجْتَمِعٌ. (S, K.) See
also جَمْعٌ, in four places. ―

to make it firmly settled, [after it had been unsettled in his mind, or] after considering what
might be its issues, or results, and saying at one
time, I will do thus, and at another time, I will
do thus. (AHeyth.)
جَمَاعَةٌ: see جَمْعٌ, in two places.
جَمَّاعٌ and ↓ مِجْمَعٌ [are mentioned together, but
not explained, in the TA: the former signifies,
and probably, judging from analogy, the latter
likewise, as also ↓ جَمُوعٌ, One who collects much;
or who collects many things]. ―
-b2-  إِبِلٌ جَمَّاعَةٌ: see
جَمِيعٌ
جُمَّاعٌ Anything of which the several component
parts are collected, brought, gathered, or drawn,
together. (IDrd, K.) ―

applied to a woman, it means Short. (TA.) ―

[Hence also,] جُمَّاعٌ الثُّرَيَّا The cluster of the
Pleiades: (IDrd:) or persons who collect together
for the rain of the Pleiades, which is the rain

herbage resulting from it. (IAar.) ―
-b4-  And جُمَّاعُ
النَّاسِ A medley, or mixed or promiscuous multitude or collection, of men, or people, (S, Msb, K,)
of various tribes; (S, K;) as also جُمَّاعٌ alone:
(TA:) or the latter, people scattered, or in a
state of dispersion. (Ham p. 302.) ―
-b5-  جُمَّاعٌ also
signifies The place [either properly or tropically]
which comprises the origin of anything; (K, TA;)
the source of descent or extraction of people; and
hence applied by I 'Ab to main tribes from which
other tribes are derived; or, as some say, used by
him as meaning various classes of men, such as
are termed أَوْزَاع and أَوْشَاب. (TA.) ―
-b6-  [And The
main, or most essential, part of a thing. Thus,]
جُمَّاعُ جَسَدِ الإِنْسَانِ means The head of the man.
(TA.) ―
-b7-  جُمَّاعُ التَّمْرِ The contraction (تَجَمُّع) of

(TA.)
جَامِعٌ [act. part. n. of 1; Collecting; &c.] ―
-b2-
الجَامِعُ one of the names of God; meaning The
Collector of the created beings for the day of
reckoning: or, as some say, the Combiner of
things of similar natures and of things of contrary natures, in existence. (IAth.) ―
-b3-  The belly;
[because it collects what passes from the stomach;]
of the dial. of El-Yemen. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Also, (Msb,)
or المَسْجِدُ الجَامِعُ, (S, K,) [The congregational
mosque;] the mosque in which the [congregational] prayers of Friday are performed; because
it collects the people for a certain time; (Msb;)
and you may also say, مَسْجِدُ الجَامِعِ, meaning
مَسْجِدُ اليَوْمِ الجَامِعِ, (S, K,) like as you say الحَقُّ
اليَقِينُ and حَقُّ اليَقِينِ, [the latter] as meaning
حَقُّ الشَّىْءِ اليَقِينِ; for it is not allowable to prefix
a noun to another of the same meaning except
with this kind of subaudition; or, accord. to Fr,
the Arabs used to do so because of the difference
of the two words themselves: (S:) or مسجد
الجامع is a mistake: (K:) so says Lth; but all
others allow it; for the Arabs prefix a subst. to
another signifying the same thing, and also to its
epithet, as in the phrases in the Kur دِينُ القَيِّمَةِ
[ch. xcviii. v. 4] and وَعْدَ الصِّدْقِ [ch. xlvi. v. 15]:
(Az, TA:) [pl. جَوَامِعُ.] ―
-b5-  مِصْرٌ جَامِعٌ [A great
town comprising a large population; a comprehensive great town]. (Msb in art. مدن [where it

-b8-  أَتَانٌ
جَامِعٌ A she-ass pregnant when beginning to be so.
(S, O, K.) ―
-b9-  ↓ جَامِعَةٌ A [collar of the kind called]
غُلّ; (S, K;) because it collects together the two
hands to the neck: (S:) pl. جَوَامِعُ. (TA.) ―
-b10-
أَمْرٌ جَامِعٌ An affair that collects people together:
or, as Er-Rághib says, a momentous affair, on
account of which people collect themselves together; as though the affair itself collected them.
(TA.) [Similar to this is the saying,] الصَّلَاةُ
جَامِعَةٌ لِكُلِّ النَّاسِ Prayer is a collector of all
people. (Msb.) ―
-b11-  It is said of Mohammad,
(Msb,) كَانَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِجَوَامِعِ الكَلِمِ He used to
speak comprehensive but concise language; language conveying many meanings in few words.
(Msb, K. [In the CK, الكلم is omitted.]) And
hence the saying of 'Omar Ibn-'Abd-el-'Azeez,
عَجِبْتُ لِمَنْ لَاحَنَ النَّاسَ كَيْفَ لَا يَعْرِفُ جَوَامِعَ الكَلِمِ,
meaning [I wonder at him who vies with men in
endeavouring to show his superiority of intelligence,] how it is that he does not [know the way
to] confine himself to conciseness, and abstain
from superfluity, of speech. (TA.) In like manner, (TA,) it is said in a trad., أُوتِيتُ جَوَامِعَ الكَلِمِ,
meaning I have had communicated to me the
Kur-án, (K, TA,) in which many meanings are
comprised in a few words. (TA.) الجَوَامِعُ مِنَ
الدُّعَآءِ, also, signifies Prayers, or supplications,
combining petitions for good and right objects of
desire with praise of God and with the general
prescribed observances proper to the case. (TA.)
You say also, المَحَامِدِ ↓ حَمِدْتُ اللّٰهَ بِمَجَامِعِ I
praised God with words comprising various
forms of praise. (Msb.) [See also جِمَاعٌ.] ―
-b12-
رَجُلٌ جَامِعٌ A man who combines such qualities
that he is suited to hardship and to easiness of
circumstances. (As. T in art. ادم.) And رَجُلٌ
جَامِعٌ لِلْخَيْرِ (T and M and K in art. ام) A man
combining all kinds of good qualities. (TK in
that art.) ―
-b13-  دَابَّةٌ جَامِعٌ A beast fit for the إِكَاف
and the سَرْج [i. e. for the saddle of either of the
kinds thus called]. (Sgh, K.) ―
-b14-  جَمَلٌ جَامِعٌ, and
نَاقَةٌ جَامِعَةٌ, (K,) accord. to ISh, (TA,) A hecamel, and a she-camel, that fails of putting forth
the tooth called ناب at the time expected; expl.
by أَخْلَفَا بُزُولًا: but this is not said except after
four years: (K:) so in the copies of the K; but
correctly, accord. to the O and TS, this is not
said after four years, [app. reckoned from the
usual time of بزول, for this is in the ninth year,
or, sometimes, in the eighth,] without the exceptive
particle. (TA.)
جَامِعَةٌ used as a subst.: see the next preceding
paragraph.
أَجْمَعُ [Collecting, comprising, or containing,
a greater, or the greatest, number or quantity;
more, or most, comprehensive. Of its usage in a
superlative sense, the following are exs.]. إِذَا أَخَذَ
شَاهِدَ زُورٍ بَعَثَ بِهِ إِلَى السُّوقِ أَجْمَعَ مَا كَانَ [When
he took a false witness, he sent him to the market
when it comprised, or contained, the greatest
number of people]: اجمع being here in the accus.
case as a denotative of state with respect to the
سوق: and the reason why كانت is not here said
[instead of كان] is that سوق is sometimes masc.
(Mgh.) And اِفْعَلْ مَا هُوَ أَجْمَعُ لِأُصُولِ الأَحْكَامِ
[Do thou that which is most comprehensive in
relation to the principles of the ordinances applying to the case]. (Msb in art. حوط.)
-A2-  [As a
simple epithet, Entire, complete, or whole: fem.
جَمْعَآءُ. You say,] بَهِيمَةٌ جَمْعَآءُ A beast free from
defects, entire in all its limbs or members, without
mutilation, and without cauterization; (TA;) a
beast from the body of which nothing has gone.
(S, K.) ―
-b2-  نَاقَةٌ جَمْعَآءُ [may sometimes have the
like meaning: or,] accord. to IAar, (TA,) A she-camel extremely aged, (K, TA,) so that her
teeth have become short, and almost gone. (TA.)
-A3-  It is also a sing. having the meaning of a
pl., (S, K,) without any proper sing. of its own:
(S:) its pl. is أَجْمَعُونَ: and its fem. is جَمْعَآءُ:
(S, K:) and the pl. of this last is جُمَعُ, though
by rule it should be formed by the addition of ا
and ت to the sing., like as the pl. of أَجْمَعُ is
formed by the addition of و and ن; (S;) the
original form from which جُمَعُ is changed being
جَمْعَاوَاتٌ; or it is جَمَاعَى; it is not جُمْعٌ, because
أَجْمَعُ is not an epithet, like as أَحْمَرُ is, of which
the pl. is حُمْرٌ; (L;) for it is determinate, though
of the measure of an epithet, which is indeterminate; (AAF;) and though it is in concordance
with the noun which precedes it, like an epithet,
it is shown to be not an epithet by its not having
a broken pl.: (L:) it is a simple corroborative;
(S, K;) and so are أَجْمَعُونَ and جَمْعَآءُ and جُمَعُ;
not used as an inchoative nor as an enunciative
nor as the agent of a verb nor as the objective
complement of a verb, like as are some other
corroboratives, such as نَفْسُهُ and عَيْنُهُ and كُلُّهُ.
(S.) You say, أَخَذْتُ حَقِّى أَجْمَعَ [I took my
right, or due, all of it, or altogether]: and رأَيْتُ
النِّسْوَةَ جُمَعَ [I saw the women, all of them, or all
together]: the last word in this and similar cases
being imperfectly declinable, and determinate
word: (Sudot;, TA:) and جَاؤُوا أَجْمَعُونَ [They came,
all of them, or all together]: and رَأَيْتُهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ
[I saw them, all of them, or all together]: and
مَرَرْتُ بِهِمْ أَجْمَعِينَ [I passed by them, all of them,
or all together]. (Msb.) Fr mentions the phrases,
أَعْجَبَنِى القَصْرُ أَجْمَعَ [The palace pleased me, all
of it, or altogether], and الدَّارُ جَمْعَآءَ [The house,
all of it, or altogether], with the accus. case, as
denotative of state; but does not allow أَجْمَعُونَ
nor جُمَعُ to be used otherwise than as corroboratives: IDrst, however, allows أَجْمَعِينَ to be used
as a denotative of state; and this is correct; and
accord. to both these ways is related the trad.,
فَصَلُّوا جُلُوسًا أَجْمَعِينَ and أَجْمَعُونَ [And pray ye
sitting, all of you, or all together]; though some
make اجمعين [here] to be a corroborative of a
pronoun understood in the accus. case, as though
the speaker said, أَعْنِيكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ [I mean you,
all of you, or all together]: (K in art. بتع:) or
اجمعين in this case is a corruption committed by
the relaters in the first age; and he is in error
who says that it is in the accus. case as a denotative of state, for corroboratives are determinate,
and the denotative of state is literally or virtually indeterminate. (Msb.) [Respecting the
usage of this corroborative together with others
similar to it, see أَبْتَعُ.] You say also, جَاؤُوا
بِأَجْمَعِهِمْ, and بِأَجْمُعِهِمْ, with damm to the م,
[They came, all of them, or all together,] (S,
Msb, K,) the latter mentioned by ISk. (Msb.)
And you say, قَبَضْتُ المَالَ أَجْمَعَهُ [I took, or
received, the property, all of it, or altogether].
(Msb.) And ↓ جَمِيعٌ, also, is used as a corroborative: (S, Msb:) as in the saying جَاؤُوا جَمِيعًا,
meaning They came, all of them: (S:) and
قَبَضْتُ المَالَ جَمِيعَهُ, like أَجْمَعَهُ [explained above]:
(Msb:) and جَمِيعَةً occurs as its fem.; but this
is extr. (TA.)
مَجْمَعٌ and مَجْمِعٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the latter
anomalous, like مَشْرِقٌ and مَغْرِبٌ &c., (TA,) A
place of collecting, and the like: (S, Msb, * K:)
[pl. مَجَامِعُ] [Hence,] مَجْمَعُ البَحْرَيْنِ, in the
Kur [xviii. 59], means The place where the two
seas meet. (Bd.) And in like manner, where it
is said in a trad., فضَرَبَ بِيَدِهِ مَجْمَعَ بَيْنَ عُنُقِى
وَكَتِفِى, [in which مَا seems to have been dropped
by the copyist between مجمع and بين,] the
meaning is, [And he struck with his hand] the
place where my neck and my shoulder-blade meet.
(TA.) [Hence also the phrase مَجَامِعُ المَحَامِدِ,
explained above: see جَامِعٌ, near the end of the paragraph. And مَجَامِعُ الأُمُورِ, meaning The concurrences of affairs, or of circumstances, or of events.]
―
-b2-  A place in which people collect, assemble, or
congregate: (Msb, * TA:) and [in like manner,]
↓ مَجْمَعَةٌ signifies an assembly-room; a sitting
room in which people assemble: (TA:) [pl. of
both مَجَامِعُ.] You say, هٰذَا الكَلَامُ أَوْلَجُ فِى
المَسَامِعِ وَأَجْوَلُ فِى المَجَامِعِ [This language, or
discourse, is more, or most, penetrating into the
ears, and more, or most, circulating in the places
of assembly]. (TA.) ―

affair determined, resolved, or decided, upon:
(S, K:) an affair agreed upon. (TA.) [The
former signification applies to both of the abovementioned phrases: the latter signification, perhaps, only to the latter phrase.] ―

collect themselves together, not separating themselves, from fear of losing their way, or perishing,

them. (S, TA.) And أَرْضٌ مُجْمِعَةٌ, like مُحْسِنَةٌ,
A land of dearth, drought, sterility, or unfruitfulness, wherein the camels upon which people journey
are not dispersed to pasture. (TA.)
