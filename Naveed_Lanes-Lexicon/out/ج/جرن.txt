جِرْنٌ The body, with the limbs or members;
syn. جِسْمٌ; said to be a dial. var. of جِرْمٌ; or
the ن may be a substitute for the جرم of أَجْرَانٌ; but
the former is the more probable, as the word has
a pl., namely, أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ أَجْرَانَهُ, and this is scarcely ever the
case when a word is formed by substitution.
(TA.) Hence the saying, أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ أَجْرَانَهُ, i. q.
القى عليه أَجْرَامَهُ and شَرَاشِرَهُ [He threw upon
him, or it, the weight of his body]: (Lh, TA:
[see also شَرْشَرةٌ, under which other explanations
are given:]) or he threw his weights [meaning
his whole weight] upon him, or it; and so القى
↓ عليه جِرَانَهُ: or, accord. to the A, he disposed,
or subjected, his mind to it; or persuaded himself
to do it; namely, an affair. (TA.)
جِرَانٌ The anterior [or under] part of the neck

camel, أَلْقَى جِرَانَهُ بِالأَرْضِ [He threw the under
part of his neck upon the ground]; meaning that
he lay down, and stretched out his neck upon the
ground. (Msb, TA.) See another ex. voce جِرْنٌ.

art. حنو.] You say also, ضَرَبَ الحَقُّ بِجِرَانِهِ,
