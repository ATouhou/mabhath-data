(S, Msb, K,) inf. n. جَلْبٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and
جَلَبٌ, (S, K,) He drove, (A, K,) or brought,
conveyed, or transported, (Mgh,) a thing, (S, A, *
Mgh, Msb, K, *) or things, such as camels, sheep,
goats, horses, captives, or slaves, or any merchandise, (TA,) from one place to another, (A,
K,) or from one country or town to another, for
the purpose of traffic; (Mgh;) as also ↓ اجتلب,
(A, K, KL,) and ↓ استجلب. (KL.) And جَلَبْتُ
الشَّىْءَ إِلَي نَفْسِى and ↓ اِجْتَلَبْتُهُ signify the same;
(S;) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  I brought, drew, attracted, or procured, the thing to myself. (PS.) [Hence,] ذَا
مِمَّا يَجْلِبُ الإِخْوَانَ (tropical:)  [This is of the things that
bring, draw, attract, or procure, brothers, or
friends]. (A, TA.) And الدَّهْرِ ↓ جَلَبَتُهُ جَوَالِبُ
(tropical:)  [The calamities of time, or of fortune, or of fate,
brought, drew, or attracted, him, or it]. (A, TA.)
[Hence also, accord. to some,] لَا جَلَبَ وَ لَا جَنَبَ, a
trad., explained as meaning, The owner of cattle
shall not be required to drive them, or bring them,
to the town, or country, in order that the collector
may take from them the portion appointed for
the poor-rate, but this shall be taken at the
waters; and when the cattle are in the yards,
they shall be left therein, and not brought forth
to the place of pasture, for the collector to take
that portion: or, as some say, ولا جنب means,
nor shall one have a horse led by his side, in a
race, in order that, when he draws near to the
goal, he may tranfser himself to it, and so outstrip his fellow: and other explanations have been
given: (Msb:) [accord. to some,] لا جلب here
means, they shall not drive, or bring, their cattle
to the collector of the portions appointed for the
poor-rate in the place where he alights, but he
shall himself come to their yards and take those
portions: or [جلب here is from the verb جَلَبَ
in a sense which will be explained below, and]
the trad. relates to horse-racing, and means, one
shall not cause his horse to be followed by a man
crying out at it and chiding it; nor shall he have
a horse without a rider led by his own horse, in
order that, when he draws near to the goal, he
may transfer himself to it, and outstrip upon it:
(Mgh:) or الجَلَبُ, which is forbidden, means
the collector's not coming to the people at their
waters to take the portions appointed for the
poor-rate, but ordering them to drive, or bring,
their cattle to him: or it relates to contending for
a stake, or wager, and means the mounting a
man upon one's horse, and, when he has drawn
near to the goal, following his horse and crying
out at it, in order that it may outstrip; which is
a kind of fraud: (S:) or it is used in both these
cases: (A 'Obeyd: [his explanations are virtually
the same as those in the S:]) or the meaning of
the trad. [so far as the former clause of it is concerned] is, that the contributions to the poor-rate
shall not be driven, or brought, to the waters nor
to the great towns, but shall be given in their
places of pasture: or it means, [or rather الجلب
means,] the collector's alighting in a place, and
then sending a person, or persons, to drive, or
bring, to him the cattle from their places, that he
may take the portion thereof appointed for the
poor-rate: or it [relates to horse-racing, and]
means the sending forth a horse in the racecourse, and a number of persons' congregating,
and crying out at it, in order that it may be
turned from its course: or a man's following his
horse, and spurring on behind it, and chiding it,
and crying out at it: (K, TA:) or the shaking a
thing behind a horse that is backward in a race,
that it may be urged on thereby, and outstrip:
or one's riding a horse, and leading behind him
another, to urge it on, in contending for a stake,
or wager: or the crying out at a horse from
behind, and urging it to outstrip. (TA. See
also 1 in art. جنب.) ―
-b2-  جَلَبَ لأَهْلِهِ He gained or
earned; sought or sought after or sought to gain
[provisions &c.; generally meaning he purveyed];
and exercised art or cunning or skill, in the management of his affairs; for his family; as also
↓ اجلب. (Lh, K.)
-A2-  جَلَبُوا, aor.
جَلِبَ and
جَلُبَ, (K,)
[inf. n. جَلَبٌ, and perhaps جَلَبَةٌ also;] and ↓ جلّبوا;
(S, K;) and ↓ اجلبوا, (K,) inf. n. إِجْلَابٌ; (Mgh;)
[the second of which is the most common;] They
raised cries, shouts, noises, a clamour, (S, Mgh,
TA,) or confused cries or shouts or noises. (Mgh,
K. *) And جَلَبَ عَلَي فَرَسِهِ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.
جَلُبَ,
(S, Msb,) inf. n. جَلَبٌ, (S,) or جَلْبٌ, (Msb,) He
chid, or urged on, his horse; as also ↓ جلّب and
↓ اجلب; (K;) the first, rare; the second and
third, usual: (TA:) he cried out at his horse,
(S, K,) from behind him, and urged him to outstrip [in a race], (S,) aor.
جَلُبَ and
جَلِبَ; (K; but this
explanation is erased in the copy of the K in its
author's handwriting, as being a repetition; and
rightly, accord. to MF; though this requires consideration; TA;) as also ↓ اجلب: (S:) he urged
his horse to run, by striking, or goading, or by
crying out, or the like; as also ↓ اجلب: or, as
some say, he led behind his horse that he was
riding another horse to urge on the former, in
contending [in a race] for a stake, or wager; as
is shown in an explanation of the tradition cited
above, لَا جَلَبَ وَلَا جَنَبَ. (TA.) It is said in the
Kur [xvii. 66], عَلَيْهِمْ بِخَيْلِكَ وَرَجْلِكَ ↓ وَأَجْلِبْ
And raise thou confused cries against them,
(Mgh,) or cry out against them, with thy forces
riding and on foot. (Bd. But see another explanation in what follows.) And it is said in a wellknown prov., جَلَبَتْ جَلْبَةً ثُمَّ أَمْسَكَتْ It, i. e. a
cloud (سَحَابَة), thundered, then refrained from
raining: applied to a coward, who threatens, and
then is silent: but accord. to some, it is with ح
in the place of ج (MF. See art. حلب.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] جَلَبَ, aor.
جَلِبَ and
جَلُبَ; and ↓ اجلب; He
threatened with evil; (K, TA;) followed by an
accus. (TA) [or, app., by عَلَى before the object]:
or (so in the TA, but in some copies of the K
“ and,”) he collected a company, a troop, or an
army. (K, TA.) [It is said that] عَلَيْهِمْ ↓ وَأَجْلِبْ,
in the Kur [xvii. 66], means And collect thou
against them [thy forces], and threaten them with
evil. (TA. But see another explanation above.)
And عَلَيْهِ ↓ اجلبو signifies also They collected
themselves together against him, (S, K, *) and
aided one another; like احلبوا. (S.) ―

also signifies The act of bringing together: or
collecting. (KL.)
3
جَاْلَبَ [جالب is explained by Golius, as on the
authority of the KL, as meaning He helped, or
assisted: but this is a mistake for حالب; for I
find مُحَالَبَةٌ explained by يارى كردن in a copy
of the KL, and the order of the words there shows
that it is not a mistranscriptiou for مجالبة.]
4
اجلب: see 1, in eleven places, in the latter
half of the paragraph.
-A2-  Also His camels brought
forth males; (S, K;) because the males that
they produce are driven, or brought, from one
place to another, and sold; opposed to احلب
“ his camels brought forth females: ” (S:) and
his camel brought forth a male. (TA.) أَجْلَبْتَ
وَلَا أَحْلَبْتَ May thy camels bring forth males,
and may they not bring forth females, is a form
of imprecation against a man, implying a wish
that he may lose the milk [that he would have
otherwise]. (TA.)
-A3-  He aided, helped, or assisted,
another. (S, K.) [So, too, احلب.]
-A4-  He put
an amulet into a جُلْبَة [which must therefore signify the piece of skin in which an amulet is
enclosed, as well as an amulet enclosed in a piece
of skin: see مُجْلِبٌ]. (K.) ―
-b2-  اجلب قَتَبَهُ, (S,
K,) inf. n. إِجْلابٌ, (T,) He covered his قتب [or
camel's saddle] (S, K) with a جُلْبَة, i. e., (S,)
with a piece of fresh, moist skin, which he left
upon it until it became dry [and tight]: (S, K: *)
or he covered the head of his قتب with a piece
of kid's, or lamb's, skin, and left it to dry upon
it. (T.)
5
تَجَلَّبَ [تجلّب rendered by Golius Clamorem ac
murmur excitavit, as on the authority of the K,
I do not find in that lexicon nor in any other.]
7
انجلب It [a camel, sheep, goat, horse,
captive, or slave, or a number of camels &c., or
any merchandise, (see 1, first sentence,)] was

R. Q. 1
جَلْبَبَهُ, (K,) or جلببهُ جِلْبَابًا, (TA,)
inf. n. جَلْبَبَةٌ, the second ب not being incorporated
into the first because the word is quasi-coordinate
to the class of دَحْرَجَةٌ, (S,) He put on him a garment of the kind called جِلْبَاب. (S, K.) Accord.
to Kh, the first ب in جلبب is [augmentative]
like the و in جَهْوَرَ and دَهْوَرَ: accord. to Yoo,
the second is [augmentative] like the ى in سَلْقَى

another, and sold; (see 4;) opposed to حَلَبٌ,
q. v.] ―

sale.]

the latter, but often used as simple substs., the
