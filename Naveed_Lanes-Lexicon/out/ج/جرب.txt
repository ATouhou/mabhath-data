which are evident mistranscriptions, or, accord.
to the 'Ináyeh of El-Khafájee, جَرِبَّانٌ, which is

ten اقفزة; each قفيز thereof consisting of ten أَعْشِرَآء
[pl. of عَشِيرٌ]; so that the عشير is the hundredth
part of the whole: (TA:) or, as some say, a
measure differing in different countries; as is
the case of the رطْل and مُدّ and ذِرَاع &c. (MF,
TA.) For the pl., see what follows. ―
-b2-  Hence,
(Mgh,) (assumed tropical:)  A certain quantity of land; (S, Mgh,
Msb;) as much as is sown with the measure of
seed so called; (A, Mgh;) like as mules and the
space that they travel are termed بَرِيدٌ: (A,
Mgh: *) it is sixty cubits by sixty cubits; accord.
to Kudámeh, the extent termed أَشْل multiplied
by itself; the اشل being sixty cubits; the cubit
being six قَبَضَات; and the قَبْضَة, four أَصَابِع:
the tenth part of the جريب is called قفيز, and the
tenth of the قفيز is called عشير; so that the قفيز is
ten اعشراء: (Mgh:) it is a distinct portion of land,

the ذِرَاع is six قبضات; ten أَذْرُع are called قَصَبَةٌ;
ten قَصَبَات are called اشل; and the جريب is the

اشل multiplied by the ذراع is called عشير: so the
جِريب is ten thousand cubits: or, accord. to
Kudámeh the Scribe, it is three thousand and
six hundred cubits: (Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَجْرِبَةٌ
and [of mult.] جُرْبَانٌ (S, Msb, K) and جُرُوبٌ.

(S, Msb,) from the Persian گُورَبْ, originally
گُورْ, i. e. “tomb of the foot:” (TA:) pl.
جَوَارِبَةٌ and جَوَارِبُ; (S, A, Msb, K;) in the
former of which, the ة is added because it is originally a foreign word. (S, TA.) You say, هُوَ
أَنْتَنُ مِنْ رِيحِ الجَوْرَبِ [He, or it, is more stinking than the smell of socks, or stockings]. (A, TA.)

with what is termed جَرَب: (S, A, Msb, K:) applied to a camel, (A, Msb,) and to a man: (S,
A:) fem. (of the first, Msb) جَرْبَآءُ (A, Msb) and
[of the second] جَرِبَةٌ: (A:) pl. (of the first, S,

and [of the first] أَجَارِبُ, which is like certain pls.
of substantives, as أَجَادِلُ and أَنَامِلُ, (TA,) and
(of the first contrary to rule, like عِجَافٌ and بِطَاحٌ
and عِصَالٌ which are pls. of أَعْجَفُ and أَبْطَحُ and
أَعْصَلُ, Msb, or of the second, IB, K, or of جُرْبٌ,
which is pl. of the first, S) جِرَابٌ: (S, IB, Msb,
K:) this last occurs in the following verse [of
‘Amr, or’ Omeyr, Ibn-El-Hobáb, or El-Khabbáb;
these variations being in different copies of the
K; but in the TA art. نشر, and in a copy of the
S in that art. and in the present one, ‘Omeyr Ibn-El-Khabbáb]:
وَفِينَا وَإِنْ قِيلَ اصْطَلَحْنَا تَضَاغُنٌ
كَمَا طَرَّ أَوْبَارُ الجِرَابِ عَلَى النَّشْرِ
(S, K *) Within us, though it be said that we have
made peace, one with another, and we are on
good terms outwardly, is mutual rancour: as the
soft wool of the mangy camels (while disease lurks
beneath, within them, TA) grows by reason of
[eating] the نشر [or herbage] that becomes green
at the and of summer (in consequence of rain
falling upon it, TA) and is injurious to animals
that pasture upon it: (K, TA:) and it is said by
IB, and in the K, that جراب, here, is pl. of
جَرِبٌ, not, as J says, of جُرْبٌ: but MF observes
that فِعَالٌ is the pl. measure of several words of
the measure فُعْلٌ, as رُمْحٌ and دُهْنٌ, and is even
said by IHsh and Ibn-Málik and AHei to be
regularly applicable to sings. of this latter measure; whereas no grammarian nor Arabic scholar
asserts that a word of the measure فَعِلٌ assumes
فِعَالٌ as the measure of its pl. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
سَيْفٌ أَجْرَبُ (tropical:)  A sword reddened by much rust,
which cannot be removed from it unless with a
file. (A.) ―
-b3-  And أَرْضٌ جَرْبَآءُ (tropical:)  Land affected
with. drought: (S, A, Msb, K: *) or salt land,
affected with drought, and containing nothing.
(ISd, TA.) ―
-b4-  And الجَرْبَآءُ (tropical:)  The sky; (S, M, A,
K;) so called because of the stars (S, TA) and
the milky way, (TA,) as though it were scabbed
with stars; (S, IF, ISd;) its stars being likened
to the marks of جَرَب; (A;) like as the sea is
called أَجْرَدُ, and like as the sky is also called رَقِيع
because [as it were] patched with stars: (AAF,
ISd:) or that tract of the sky in which the sun
and moon revolve: (M, K:) or the lowest heaven:
(AHeyth, TA:) and accord. to the M, جربة [so
in the TA, app. ↓ جَرِبَةُ,] is applied as a determinate [proper] name to the sky. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And
جَرْبَآءُ (assumed tropical:)  A beautiful girl; (IAar, K;) so called
because the women separate themselves from her,
seeing that their goodly qualities are rendered
foul by comparison with hers. (IAar, TA.)
تَجْرِبَةٌ is a subst. from جَرَّبَ: (Msb:) or it is
an inf. n. of that verb, (M, A, K,) and is one of
the inf. ns. from which pls. are formed: (M, TA:)
its pl. is تَجَاربُ (M, Msb, TA) and تَجَارِيبُ,
(M, TA.) En-Nábighah says,
إِلَى اليَوْمِ قَدْ جُرِّبْنَ كُلَّ التَّجَارِبِ
[To this day, they (referring to females) have been
tried with every kind of tryings]: and El-Aashà
says,
كَمْ جَرَّبُوهُ فَمَا زَادَتْ تَجَارِبُهُمْ
أَبَا قُدَامَةَ إِلَّا المَجْدَ وَالقَنَعَا
[How often have they tried him, and their tryings
of Aboo-Kudámeh have not increased aught save
his glory and contentment!]; تجارب being here
a pluralized inf. n. made to govern an objective
complement; which is a strange fact. (M, TA.)
[But in this latter instance, we may consider
ابا قدامة as a first objective complement of رادت,
and شَيْئَا, understood before الّا, as a second objective complement of the same verb.]
مُجْرِبٌ A man who has his camels affected with
what is termed جَرَب [i. e. the mange, or scab]:
whence the prov., لَا إِلَاهَ لِمُجْرِبٍ [There is no god
to one who has his camels affected with the
mange]; as though he renounced his god by
frequently swearing falsely by him that he had
no pitch when it was demanded of him [for the
purpose of curing other camels]: (A:) or لَا أَلِيَّةَ
لِمْجْرِبٍ [There is no oath to one who has his
camels affected with the mange; for the reason
above mentioned, or because he is likely to deny
that he has mangy camels lest his camels should
be prevented from coming to water: and hence
also,] أَكْدَبُ مِنْ مُجْرِبٍ [More lying than one
who has his camels affected with the mange];
another prov. (Meyd. [See Freytag's Arab.
Prov., ii. 382.])
مُجَرَّبٌ One who has been tried, or proved, in
affairs, and whose qualities have become known:
(T, TA:) or one who has been tried, or proved,
and strengthened by experience in affairs: (S:)
[experienced, or expert, in affairs:] or one whose
qualities have been tried, or proved. (K, TA.)
And ↓ مُجَرِّبٌ One having experience in affairs.
(K, TA.) In general, but not always, (MF,) the
Arabs used the former of these two epithets
[which are virtually synonymous]. (S, MF.) ―
-b2-
دَرَاهِمُ مُجَرَّبَةٌ Weighed money. (Kr, K.) ―
-b3-  المُجَرَّبُ
The lion. (Sgh, K.)
-A2-  [It is also employed as
an inf. n. of 2, in accordance with a usage of
which there are many other instances; as in the
saying,] أَنْتَ عَلَى المُجَرَّبِ [Thou art about to
have the proof, or experience]: a prov., mentioned by AZ: said to him who asks respecting a
thing which he is about to know of himself:
originally said by a woman to a man who asked
her an indecent question which he was himself
about to resolve. (TA.)
مُجَرِّبٌ: see مُجَرَّبٌ.
