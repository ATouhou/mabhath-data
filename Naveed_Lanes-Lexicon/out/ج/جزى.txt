جزى1
جَزَى, aor
جَزِىَ (Msb, K,) inf. n. جَزَآءٌ, (Msb,)
It (a thing) paid; gave, or rendered, as a satisfaction; or made, gave, or rendered, satisfaction:
(Msb:) or satisfied; sufficed; or contented. (K.)
And جَزَيْتُ الدَّيْنَ I paid the debt. (Msb.) And
جَزَيْتُ فُلَانًا حَقَّهُ I paid such a one his right, or
due. (TA.) And مَا يَجْزِينِى هٰذَا الثَّوْبُ This
garment does not suffice me. (TA.)―
-b2-  And hence,
(TA,) جَزَى عَنْهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) [aor. and]
inf. n. as above, (Mgh,) It (a thing) paid for
him; gave, or rendered, [a thing] as a satisfaction
for him; made, gave, or rendered, satisfaction for
him; (S, Mgh, Msb,* K;) and some of the lawyers use ↓اجزى in this sense, like اجزأ: (Az,
Mgh, Msb:) جَزَى is of the dial. of El-Hijáz,
and اجزأ of the dial. of Temeem. (Akh, Msb.)
Hence, in the Kur [ii. 45], لَا تَجْزِى نَفْسٌ عَنْ نَفْسٍ
شَيْئًا [A soul shall not give anything as a satisfaction for a soul, i. e. for another soul: or a soul
shall not make satisfaction for a soul at all;
accord. to the latter rendering, شيئا being put in
the accus. case after the manner of an inf. n.].
(S, Msb.) You say also, جَزَتْ عَنْكَ شَاةٌ A sheep,
or goat, made satisfaction for thee [as a sacrifice];
(S, TA;) as also ↓أَجْزَتْ: (TA:) Benoo-Temeem
say أَجْزَأَتْ, with ء: (S, TA:) this last, thus explained, is a dial, var. mentioned by IKtt (Msb.)
And كَذَا عَنْ كَذَا ↓اجزى Such a thing stood,
or served, in lieu, in the place, or in stead, of
such a thing, without sufficing. (Zj, K.) And
قَلِيلٌ مِنْ كَثِيرٍ↓يُجْزِى; and هٰذَامِنْ هٰذَا; A
little stands, or serves, in lieu of much; and this,
of this. (IAar, TA.) And عَنْهُ مُجْزَى ↓ اجزى
فُلَانٍ and مُجْزَاةَ فُلَانٍ and (as though the augmentative letter [ا in اجزى] were imagined to be
rejected, TA) مَجْزَى فلان and مَجْزَاةَ فلان He
satisfied, sufficed, or contented, him as such a
one; he stood, or served, him in stead of such a
one; a dial. var. of اجزأ. (K.) And ↓ اجزى
مُجْزَى غَيْرِهِ It (a thing) satisfied, sufficed, or
contented, as another thing; it stood, or served,
in stead of another thing. (Msb.) And ↓اجزاكَ,
with the [second] objective complement suppressed, It was sufficient for thee. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-
جَزَاهَ كَذَا (Msb,* TA,) and جَزَاهُ بِهِ (K,) or
بِمَا صَنَعَ, (S,) and عَلَيْهِ, (K,) [aor. and] inf. n.
as above, (S, K,) He repaid, requited, compensated, or recompensed, him (Msb, K TA) [for
such a thing, for it, or for what he had done];
as also ↓جازاهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. مُجَازَاةٌ and جِزَآءٌ:
(K:) or, accord. to Fr, [contr. to many instances
in the Kur,] the former verb relates only to good;
and the latter, to good and to evil: but accord.
to others, the former may relate to good and to
evil; and the latter, to evil. (TA.) [See also
جَزَآءٌ, below.] One says, in praying for another,
جَزَاهُ اللّٰهُ خَيْرًا May God repay him good: and
requite, or recompense, him for good [that he has
done]. (Msb.) And بِذَنْبِهِ ↓ جَازَيْتُهُ I punished
him for his crime, or sin, or act of disobedience.
(Msb.) And جَزَى عَنْهُ فُلَانًا He requited, compensated, or recompensed, for him, such a one.

الظُّرُوفِ الَّتِى لَا يُجَازَى بِهَا إِلَّا مَعَ مَا, i. e. حيث is

مَجْزًى and مُجْزًى are used as inf. ns. of 4.

مُجْزٍ [act. part. n. of 4. It is said in the TA
that مجزى, applied to a camel, signifies Sufficing
for a load or burden; and its pl. is مجازى.
And that مجزى لِأَمْرِهِ, applied to a man, signifies
Sufficing for his affair. But مجزى in these
instances is evidently a mistranscription, for مُجْزٍ;
and مجازى, for مَجَازٍ, Mistranscriptions of this
Kind are of frequent occurrence in Lexicons.]
مَجْزَاةٌ and مُجْزَاةٌ are used as inf. ns. of 4. [See
