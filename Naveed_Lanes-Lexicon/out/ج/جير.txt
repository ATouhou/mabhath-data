جير2
جيّر He plastered a watering-trough or tank
with جَيَّار. (TA.)
جَيْرِ, with kesr to the ر, (S, Mughnee, K, &c.,)
like أَمْسِ; (Mughnee;) and جَيْرَ, like أَيْنَ; and
sometimes جَيْرٍ; (Mughnee, K;) or this, where
it occurs, is for جَيْرِ إِنَّ, and is properly written
جَيْرِنْ, إِنَّ in the sense of نَعَمْ being a corroborative of جَيْرِ, and its hemzeh and sheddeh and final
vowel being here suppressed: (Mughnee:) a
form of oath, (S, K,) or put in the place of an
oath, (IAmb, TA,) meaning Verily, or truly;
syn. حَقًّا: (S, K:) or a responsive particle,
(Mughnee,) meaning yes; syn. نَعَمْ [which is
most approved as responsive to an interrogation],
(Mughnee, K,) or أَجَلْ [which is most approved
as responsive to an affirmation]; (Sharh et-Tesheel, K;) not a noun in the sense of حَقًّا, for
were it so it would be an inf. n.; nor in the sense
of أَبَدًا, for were it so it would be an adv. n. of
time; and if it were a noun it would be decl.,
and would admit the article ال, and would not
have إِنَّ for a corroborative, nor have لَا opposed
to it, as it has in the saying,
إِذَا تَقُولُ لَا ابْنَةُ العُجَيْرِ
تَصْدُقُ لَا إِذَا تَقُولُ جَيْرِ
[When the daughter of El-'Ojeyr says لا, she
speaks truly: not when she says جير]: (Mughnee:) or it is a verbal noun, meaning I know;
syn. أَعْرِفُ; as is mentioned by Ibn-Abi-r-Rabeea,
and by Er-Radee on the authority of 'Abd-El-
Káhir. (MF.) You say, جَيْرِ لَا آتِيكَ Verily, or
truly, [&c.,] I will not come to thee. (S.) And
جَيْرِ لَا أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ Verily, or truly, [&c.,] I will
not do that. (K, * TA.) And لَا جَيْرِ لَا أَفْعَلُ No,
verily, or truly, [&c.,] I will not do [that]. (K.)
جِيرٌ Gypsum; syn. جِصٌّ. (IAar, TA.) [In
modern Arabic, Lime: see also what next follows.]
جَيَّارٌ Quick lime, and the mixtures thereof, with
which are plastered watering-troughs or tanks,
and baths; syn. صَارُوجٌ: (S, K:) quick lime and
gypsum mixed with ashes: (IAar TA:) or quick
lime alone. (TA. [See also جِيرٌ.])
-A2-  [A limeburner: so in the present day: see أَتُونٌ.]
-A3-
Heat in the chest, by reason of rage or hunger;
as also ↓ جَائِرٌ: (S, K:) or cough, or the like.
(Ham p. 56.) It is app. of the measure فَعَّالٌ; or
it may be of the measure فَيْعَالٌ; or فَوْعَالٌ [originally جَوْيَارٌ]. (IJ, TA.) ―
-b2-  Strength, or vehemence. (TA.)
جَائِرٌ: see جَيَّارٌ.

or made deep: or plastered with gypsum. (K.)
