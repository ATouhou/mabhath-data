though he cut off from it declinability: (Mbr,
TA:) from جَزَمَ in the first of the senses explained above: جَزْمٌ in a declinable word being
like سُكُونٌ in an indeclinable word. (S.) It is
said in a trad. of En-Nakha'ee, التَّكْبِيرُ جَزْمٌ والتَّسْلِيمُ
جَزْمٌ, meaning that neither should be prolonged in
utterance, and that the last letter in each should
be without a case-ending, i.e., be quiescent; so
that one should not say [in prayer] اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ [nor

instance, and اللّٰهْ in the latter]: or, accord. to Z,
that one should not exceed the due bounds in the
pronunciation of the hemzeh and the medd: (TA:)
