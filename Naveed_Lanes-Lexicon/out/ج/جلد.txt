-b3-  جَلَدَ جَارِيَتَهُ,
(K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,) (tropical:)  He lay

[Hence,] جَلَدَ عُمَيْرَةَ [(assumed tropical:)  i. q. نَكَحَ اليَدَ], a metonymical phrase: جَلْدُ عُمَيْرَةَ meaning الخَضْخَضَةُ,

mistake for أُجْلِدَت, like أُضْرِبَت;] The land was,

instance, a pair of socks, or stockings: (Mgh:)
and in like manner, [he bound] a book: (A, K: *)
and he clad a young camel in the skin of another
young camel: (L: [see جَلَدٌ:]) thus the verb
bears two contr. significations. (Mgh.)
-A2-  [He

without any indication of an authority.)]

5
تجلّد He affected hardiness, strength, sturdiness, and endurance, or patience; constrained
himself to behave with hardiness, &c. (S, * A, * L,
K. *) So in the phrase تجلّد لِلشَّامِتِينَ [He constrained himself to behave with hardiness, &c., to
those who rejoiced at his misfortune]. (A, TA.)
In the phrase تجلّد عَنْهُ [He constrained himself
to endure with hardiness and patience the loss, or
want, of him, or it], the verb is made trans. by
means of عن because it implies the meaning of
تَصَبَّرَ. (L.) ―

word mentioned by the generality of the lexicographers; (TA;) occurring at the end of a verse
with kesr to the second as well as the first letter,
↓ جِلِدٌ, agreeably with a license allowed to a poet
in such a case, to give to a quiescent letter in a
rhyme the same vowel as that which the preceding
letter has; (S;) and ↓ جَلَدٌ, (IAar, S, K,) like

limbs of an animal: (Az, Msb:) or the exterior

-b3-
الجِلْدُ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The penis. (Fr, L, K: but
in the CK, in this sense, it is written الجَلْدُ.)
Agreeably with this explanation, its pl. جُلُود is
said by Fr to be used in the Kur xli. 20: (L:)
or as meaning the pudenda: (L, K:) but ISd
holds that this word there means the skins, with
