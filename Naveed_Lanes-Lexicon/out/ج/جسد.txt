تجسّد from الجَسَدُ is like تجسّم from الجِسْمُ:
(S:) [apparently signifying He became, or assumed, a جَسَد, or body; or became corporeal, or
incarnate; and thus it is used by late writers, and
in the present day: but تجسّم generally signifies
he became corpulent: accord. to the TA, تجسّد,
said of a man, is like تجسّم: accord, to the KL,
the former signifies he became possessed of a body:
accord. to the PS, he became corporeal, or corpulent.]
جَسَدٌ The body, with the limbs or members, [or
whole person,] of a human being, and of a jinnee
(or genie), and of an angel: (El-Bári', L, Msb,
K:) it is thus applied only to the body of a
rational animal; (El-Bári', Msb;) to no body
that is nourished with food except that of a human
being; but to the body of every rational creature
that neither eats nor drinks, such as the genii and
the angels: (L:) [the genii, however, are commonly believed to eat and drink:] or, accord. to
ISd, it seems to be applied to a body other than
that of a human being tropically: (TA:) the
[golden] calf of the Children of Israel cried, but
did not eat nor drink; [wherefore it is termed
جسد;] and in the Kur [vii. 146 and xx. 90],
جَسَدًا is a substitute for عِجْلًا, or it may be meant
for ذَا جَسَدٍ: (L:) [but see another explanation
of جسدا, as there used, below:] or جَسَدٌ is syn.
with بَدَنٌ [which is generally held to signify the
body without the head and arms and legs]: (S,
A:) the pl. is أَجْسَادٌ. (Lh, Msb, TA.) Lh mentions the saying, إِنَّهَا لَحَسَنَةُ الأَجْسَادِ [Verily she is
beautiful in respect of body]; as though the sing.
of which the pl. is thus used were applied to every
separate part. (TA.)
-A2-  Saffron; (S, Msb, K)
as also ↓ جِسَادٌ: (Lth, IAar, ISk, S, A, Msb, K:)
or a similar dye: (S:) and ↓ the latter signifies
also a similar dye; (Lth, Msb,) red, or intensely
yellow: (Lth, TA:) or bastard saffron; syn.
عُصْفُرٌ; (Msb;) and so the former word. (L.)
―
-b2-  Also, (S, L, Msb, K,) and ↓جَسِدٌ (L, K) and

↓ جِسَادٌ, (R,) (assumed tropical:)  Blood; (S;) as also ↓ مُجْسَدٌ, as
being likened to saffron: (Ham p. 215:) or dry
blood: (R, L, Msb, K:) pl. of the first as above.
(Ham p. 127.) ―
-b3-  Some say that عِجْلًا جَسَدًا, in
the Kur, [in two verses referred to above,] means
A red golden calf. (S.)

K, TA, in the CK الجَلَّسَدُ) the name of A certain
idol, (S, L, K,) which was worshipped in the time
of paganism: (L:) the ل is an augmentative
letter accord. to J and most of the leading lexicologists; but F disapproves of the mention of the
word in this art. (TA.)
مُجْسَدٌ Red. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also, (S, Msb, K,) and
sometimes ↓ مِجْسَدٌ, (IF, Msb,) and ↓ مُجَسَّدٌ, (K,)
A garment dyed with saffron: (K:) or with
bastard saffron: (IAth, TA:) dyed with جِسَاد:
(IF, Msb:) or saturated with dye: (S:) or one
says, عَلَى فُلَانٍ ثَوْبٌ مُشْبَعٌ مِنَ الصِبْغِ [Upon such
a one is a garment saturated with dye]; and عَلَيْهِ
ثَوْبٌ مُفْدَمٌ [Upon him is a garment saturated
with red dye]; and when it is standing up by
reason of [the thickness of] the dye, it is termed
مُجْسَدٌ: (ISK, S:) the pl. of this word is مَجَاسِدُ.
(S.) ―
-b3-  See also what next follows: ―
-b4-  and see
جَسَدٌ.
مِجْسَدٌ, (S, A, K,) or ↓ مُجْسَدٌ, (A,) the latter
is the original form, because it is from أُجْسِدَ,
meaning, "it was made to stick, or adhere, to the
body,” (Fr, S,) like مِطْرَفٌ and مُطْرَفٌ, and مِصْحَفٌ
and مُصْحَفٌ, (Fr, TA,) A garment worn next the
body (IAar, S, A, K) by a woman, so that she
sweats in it: (TA:) and a garment worn next
the body dyed with saffron: (A:) pl. مَجَاسِدُ.
(IAar, A.) [Hence,] لَا يَخْرُجَنَّ إِلَى المَسَاجِدِ فِى
المَجَاسِدِ (IAar, A) They (women) shall by no
means go forth to the mosques in the shirts that
are next the body. (IAar.) ―
-b2-  See also مُجْسَدٌ.
مُجَسَّدٌ: see مُجْسَدٌ.
