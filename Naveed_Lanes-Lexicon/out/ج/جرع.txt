rope, (S, K,) or of a bow-string, (K,) so that

جَرِعٌ A rope, (K,) or a bow-string, (TA,)
having the twisting termed جَرَعٌ in one of its
strands; as also ↓ مُجَرَّعٌ: (K:) or, accord. to
IAar, a bow-string that is even, except that there
is a prominence in one part of it, wherefore it is
rubbed and pulled with a piece of a كِسَآء [q. v.]
until that prominence disappears: and ↓ the
latter, accord. to ISh, a bow-string not uniformly
nor well twisted, having in it prominences, so
that one of its strands appears above the others,
or some appear above others. (TA.)
جَرْعَةٌ: see what next follows, in three places:
-A2-  and see جَرَعَةٌ, in two places.
جُرْعَةٌ A gulp, or as much as is swallowed at once,
of water; a جُرْعَة of water being like a لُقْمَة of
food: (Msb:) or a sup, or sip; or as much as
is supped, or sipped, at once; or a mouthful of
what is supped, or sipped; (syn. حُسْوَةٌ;) of water;
(S, K;) as also ↓ جَرْعَةٌ and ↓ جِرْعَةٌ: or جُرْعَةٌ
and ↓ جَرْعَةٌ are substs. [signifying the act of
swallowing water] from جَرِعَ المَآءَ “ he swallowed
the water: ” (K:) or ↓ جَرْعَةٌ signifies a single act
of swallowing water: (IAth, L:) and جُرْعَةٌ, what
one swallows: (L, K:) or a mouthful which one
swallows: (TA:) or a small draught: (IAth:)
and its pl. is جُرَعٌ. (Msb, TA.) The dim. is
↓ جُرَيْعَةٌ. (S, K.) And hence the prov., أَفْلَتَ
فُلَانٌ جُرَيْعَةَ الذَّقَنِ, (Sgh, K,) the verb being
intrans., and جريعة being in the accus. case as a
denotative of state, as though the speaker said,
أَفْلَتَ قَاذِفًا جُرَيْعَةَ الذَّقَنِ; (Sgh;) or بِجُرَيْعَةِ
الذَّقَنِ; (S, K;) or ↓ بِجُرَيْعَآئِهَا; (K;) Such a one
escaped [from destruction] when his spirit, or the
remains thereof, had become in his mouth; (L,
K;) or near thereto, (K,) as a sup [or little sup] of
water to the chin [of a person drinking]; (TA;)
or when death was as near to him as a little sup
of water to the chin; (L;) or when at his last
gasp: (Fr, S:) applied to one who has been at
the point of destruction, and then escaped: (S:)
or, accord. to AZ, it is thus; أَفْلَتَنِى جُرَيْعَةَ الذَّقَنِ,
which may mean he made me to escape &c., or
he escaped from me &c.; in the latter case, افلتنى
being for أَفْلَتَ مِنِّى; and [it is said that] جريعة
is prefixed to الذقن because the motion of the
chin indicates the nearness of the departure of the
soul: or the meaning of the words related by AZ
may be, he made me, i. e. the remains of my
soul, to escape; the last two words being a substitute for the pronoun affixed to the verb.
(Sgh.) One says also, أَفْلَتَنَىِ جُرَيْعَةَ الرِّيقِ, meaning He outwent me, [or escaped me,] and I swallowed my spittle in wrath, or rage, against him.
(TA.) And مَا مِنْ جُرْعَةٍ أَحْمَدُ عُقْبَانًا مِنْ جُرْعَةِ
غَيْظٍ نَكْظِمُهَا (tropical:)  [There is nothing that is swallowed
more praiseworthy in its result than what is
swallowed of wrath, or rage, which we repress,
or restrain]. (TA.)
جِرْعَةٌ: see جُرْعَةٌ.
جَرَعَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ جَرْعَةٌ (K) and ↓ جَرْعَآءُ (S,
K) and ↓ أَجْرَعُ (K) An even piece, (S,) or a
round piece, or hill, or hillock, (K,) of sand, that
produces no plants, or herbage; (S, K;) and, as
some add, that retains no water: (TA:) or a
piece, or tract, of sand, good for producing plants,
or herbage, in which is no softness, or looseness:
(Sgh, L, K:) or land in which is ruggedness,
resembling sand: (L, K:) or a hill of which one
side consists of sand, and one side of stones: (K:)
or what is termed ↓ جرعاء and ↓ اجرع is larger
than what is termed جَرَعَةٌ: ↓ جرعاء is also explained as signifying sand of which the middle
is elevated, and of which the sides are thin: and,
accord. to IAth, ↓ اجرع signifies a wide place, in
which is ruggedness: (TA:) or this last, a plain,
or soft, place, intermixed with sand: (Ham
p. 574:) جَرَعَةٌ is sing., or n. un., of ↓ جَرَعٌ: (S,
K: *) or, accord. to some, this last word is a
sing., like اجرع; and its pl. [of pauc.] is أَجْرَاعٌ
and [of mult.] جِرَاعٌ: the pl. of جَرَعَةٌ is جِرْعَانٌ:
and the pl. of ↓ جَرْعَةٌ is جِرَاعٌ: and the pl. of ↓ جِرِعاء
is جَرْعَاوَاتٌ: and the pl. of ↓ اجرع is أَجَارِعُ.

as will satisfy thirst, but only some sups: (K:)
pl. مَجَارِيعُ (L, K) and مَجَارِعُ: (L:) J explains
the former pl. as signifying she-camels having
little milk; as though there were not in their
udders more than some sups; and the sing. he
does not mention. (TA.)
مُجَرَّعٌ: see جَرِعٌ, in two places.
