think it probable that this is a mistranscription for
بِوَحْىٍ, or بِوَحًى, or the like, for, though وَشْىٌ
might perhaps, by straining a metaphor, be applied
to denote a varied sound, its being understood in
this sense seems to be forbidden by its being here
added] like the first. (Kh, TA.) [This explanation is perhaps illustrated by the fact that the bass
in the music of the Arabs is often formed of one
prolonged note, falling and rising.] ―
