this is sometimes called جبّانة because the place
of prayer is generally in the burial-ground:
(Msb:) accord. to Kh, these two words, in this
sense, are from الجَبُّ and الجَبُوبُ; but others
derive them from جبن. (TA in art. جب.) ―

level, elevated land, that produces much herbage:
(Aboo-Kheyreh, TA:) accord. to ISh, it is smooth,
without trees; but it may have in it hills, and a
tract abounding with trees: and sometimes the
جبّانة is level, without hills and without any tract
abounding with trees; but it is not in sand nor in
mountains, though it may be in [high grounds
such as are termed] قِفَاف [pl. of قُفٌّ] and in
