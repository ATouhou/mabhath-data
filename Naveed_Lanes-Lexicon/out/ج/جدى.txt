جِدْىBٌ; (S;) this being a bad dial. var.: (Msb:)
pl. (of pauc., TA, applied to three, S) أَجْدٍ (S,
Msb, K) and (of mult., TA, applied to more
than three, S) جِدَآءٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and جِدْيَانٌ:

[the star a of Ursa Minor, commonly called
the pole-star,] that revolves with بَنَاتُ نَعْشٍ, (K,)
by the side of the [north] pole, by which the
kibleh is known, (S,) or according to which the
kibleh is turned; (Msb;) the bright star at the
extremity of the tail of the Lesser Bear; (Kzw;)
the star of the kibleh; (Mgh;) also called جَدْىBُ
الفَرْقَدِ; (Mgh, Msb;) and called by the astronomers ↓ الجُدَىُّ, in the dim. form, to distinguish
it from what next follows. (Mgh, MF.) [See

[one on either side; for] there are two of such
stuffed things: (S:) the pl. of the former is

the authority of A'Obeyd and AA and En-Nadr,

the S جَدًا, but the former (which I find in two
copies of the S) is said by IB to be the right;

of شَرْيَةٌ: (IB, TA:) the pl. of ↓ جَدِيَّةٌ is جَدَايَا.
