say, جُوعًا لَهُ وَنُوعًا [May God decree hunger to
him]: accord. to Sb, an instance of inf. ns. in the
accus. case by reason of a verb understood: it is a
form of imprecation: and the latter noun may not
be put before the former, because it is a corroborative to it: (TA:) or, accord. to some, نُوعٌ means
“ thirst. ” (S, &c., in art. نوع.) And ↓ عَامُ مَجَاعَةٍ

is] by reason of [the hunger of his owners occasioned by] murrain befalling the camels; (K, *
TA;) his owners falling into hunger and distress
and leanness: (TA:) or كلب was the name of
a certain man, who was an object of fear, wherefore he was asked for a pledge, and he pledged
his family: then obtaining possession of the camels,

his family, he drove them away, and left his
family: (K, TA:) some relate this prov. differently, saying [سَمِنَ كَلْبٌ “ a dog,” or “ Kelb,”

former] is جُوَّعٌ (S, Msb, K) and جُيَّعٌ, with the

perhaps of both,] جِيَاعٌ (S, K) and جَاعَةٌ (K * in
art. سوع) and جَيَاعَى [with the و changed into ى
contr. to rule, if this be not a mistake for جِيَاعٌ,
in which the و is changed into ى by rule].
