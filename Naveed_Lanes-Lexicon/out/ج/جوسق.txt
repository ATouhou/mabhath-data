جوسقجَوْسَقٌ i. q. قَصْرٌ [A palace: or a pavilion, or
kind of building wholly or for the most. part
isolated, sometimes on the top of a larger building,
i. e., a belvedere, and sometimes projecting from
a larger building, and generally consisting of one
room if forming a part of a larger building]:
(S, K, and Ham p. 823:) or a fortress; syn.
حِصْنٌ: (M, IB, TA:) or [a building] resembling
a حِصْن: (M:) an arabicized word, (Lth, JK,
S, M,) from the Persian كُوشْك: (TA:) its
primary meaning is a حِصْن in a state of demolition; and a ruined قَصْر: pl. جَوَاسِقُ and جَوَاسِيقُ;
the latter formed by giving fulness of sound to
the kesreh, or by poetic license. (Ham ubi
suprà.) There were, in the Karáfeh, [the great
burial-ground of the Egyptian metropolis,] numerous قُصُور, i. e., what are called جواسق, having
belvederes (مَنَاظِر) and gardens: but most of
the جواسق were without gardens and without a
well; being lofty belvederes: all of them were
called قُصُور. (El-Makreezee's “ Khitat,” ii. 453.)
