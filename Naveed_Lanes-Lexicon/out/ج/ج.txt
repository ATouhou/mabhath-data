جalphabetical letter
ج
The fifth letter of the alphabet: called جِيمٌ,
which is one of the names of letters of the fem.
gender, but which it is allowable to make masc.:
it is one of the letters termed مَجْهُورَة [or vocal,
i. e. pronounced with the voice, and not with the
breath only]: and of the number of the letters
termed مَحْقُورَة, and حُرُوفُ القَلْقَلَةِ, because it
cannot be uttered in a case of pause without a
strong compression, and a strong sound: and it
is also one of those termed شَجْرِيَّة, from الشَّجْرُ,
which is the place of opening of the mouth.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  It is sometimes substituted for ى, when
the latter letter is doubled, (K,) or is so substituted by some of the Arabs; (AA, S;) as in
فُقَيْمِجٌّ, for فُقَيْمِىٌّ; (AA, S, K;) and مُرِّجٌّ, for
مُرِّىٌّ. (AA, S.) An Arab of the desert recited
to Khalaf El-Ahmar,
الْمُطْعِمَانِ الَّحْمَ بِالْعَشِجِّ خَالِى عُوَيْفٌ وَأَبُو عَلِجِّ
[My maternal uncle is 'Oweyf, and Aboo-'Alijj,
who feed with flesh-meat at nightfall]; meaning
عَلِىّ and عَشِىّ. (S.) It is also sometimes substituted for a single ى. (S, K.) AZ gives the
following ex.:
يَا رَبِّ إِنْ كُنْتَ قَبِلْتَ حُجَّتِجْ
فَلَا يَزَالُ شَاحِجٌ يَأْتِيكَ بِجْ
[O my Lord, if Thou accept my plea, a brayer
(or mule) shall not cease to bring me to Thee (i. e.
to thy temple)]; (S;) meaning حُجَّتِى (K) [and
بِى]. أَمْسَجَتْ and أَمْسَجَا are also mentioned as
occurring in a verse, for أَمْسَتْ and أَمْسَى [because
originally أَمْسَيَتْ and أَمْسَىَ]. (S.) But all these
substitutions are abominable, (S, Ibn-'Osfoor,) and
only allowable in cases of poetical necessity. (Ibn-
'Osfoor.) It is further said that some of the Arabs,
among whom were the tribe of Kudá'ah, changed
ى, when occurring immediately after ع, into ج;
and said, for رَاعٍ, [originally رَاعِىٌ,] رَاعِجٌ: this
is what is termed عَجْعَجَةٌ: Fr attributes the
substitution of ج for ى to the tribe of Teiyi, and
some of the tribe of Asad. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Some of
the Arabs also changed it into ى; saying شَيَرَةٌ
for شَجَرَةٌ, and جَثْيَاثٌ for جَثْجَاثٌ, and يَصَّصَ
for جَصَّصَ. (AZ, S in art. يص.)
-A2-  [As a numeral, ج denotes Three; and, as such, is generally
written without the dot, but thus ح, or thus ح,
to distinguish it from ح, which denotes eight.]
