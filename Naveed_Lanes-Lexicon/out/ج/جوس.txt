[Hence,] جَاسُوا خِلَالَ الدِّيَارِ, (S, A,) in the Kur
[xvii. 5], (TA,) inf. n. as above, (S, A, K,) They
went through the midst of the houses (تَخَلَّلُوهَا),
and sought for what was in them, as a man seeks
for news, or tidings; as also ↓ اجتاسوا: (S:) or
they went to and fro among the houses, in a
sudden attack: (A, K:) or the meaning in the
Kur is, they slew you amid your houses; and
حَاسُوا signifies the same; going and coming:
(Fr, TA:) and, inf. n. as above, (K,) and جَوَسَانٌ,
(S, K,) they went round about (Zj, S, A, K) by
night, (S,) among the houses, (Zj, A, K,) looking
if any remained whom they had not slain, (Zj,
TA,) or doing mischief: (A:) and ↓ اِجْتِيَاسٌ signifies the same as جَوَسَانٌ, (K, TA,) the going
round about by night. (TA.) ―
-b3-  جِيسَ also signifies It (anything) was trodden: جَوْسٌ is said
to be like دَوْسٌ: (TA:) and you say, جَآءَ فُلَانٌ
يَجُوسُ النَّاسَ Such a one came stepping over the
people; syn. يَتَخَطَّاهُمْ. (A, TA. *) And accord.
to A' Obeyd, جُسْتُهُ and حُسْتُهُ both signify I came
into it, and trod it; (خَالَطْتُهُ وَوَطِئْتُهُ;) meaning,
any place. (TA.) You say also, جَاسَهُمُ الأَسَدُ
The lion trod upon them: or came into the midst
of them, and did mischief among them. (TA;
[in which the inf. n. of the verb in this sense is
said to be جَوْسٌ and جَوْسَآءُ: but the latter is
probably a mistranscription for جَوَسَانٌُ.])
