Hence, نَزَلَتِ المَحَبَّةُ فِى جَذْرِ قَلْبِهِ Love took up
its abode in the bottom (أَصْل) of his heart. (A.)
And [hence] it is said in a trad., إِنَّ الأَمَانَةَ نَزَلَتْ
فِى جَذْرِ قُلُوبِ الرِّجَالِ [app. meaning, Verily
reason, or intellect, or rather conscience, each of
which is a trust committed by God to man, and a
faculty which renders him responsible for his
faith and works, (see, in art. امن, an explanation
of أَمَانَةٌ as used in the Kur xxxiii. 72,) hath taken
up its abode in the bottom of the hearts of men].

from which one springs. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And the former, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) and the latter, or the

A root of a number; (A;) an arithmetical root;
(Mgh, K;) [a square root;] a number that is
multiplied by itself; (Msb;) as when you say
that ten multiplied by ten is a hundred; (Mgh,
Msb;) and three multiplied by three is nine;
(A;) in the former of which cases, ten is the
جذر, (Mgh, Msb,) i. e., the جذر of a hundred;
(Mgh;) and in the latter, three; (A;) and in
each case, the [square or] product of the multiplication is called the مَال, (Msb,) or the جُذَآء, (A,)
or the ↓ مَجذُور: (Mgh:) [pl. of pauc. أجْذَارٌ,
and of mult. جُذُورٌ.] It is of two kinds, نَاطِقٌ
[i. e. rational], and أَصَمُّ [i. e. surd, or irrational]:
the latter known only to God, accord. to a saying
of 'Áïsheh. (Mgh.)
جِذْرٌ: see جَذْرٌ.
جُؤْذَرٌ and جُؤْذُرٌ (S, K) and جُوذَرٌ and جَوْذَرٌ and
جَؤْذَرٌ and ↓ جِيذَرٌ, (K, TA,) the last of which is
written in some copies of the K [and in the CK]
جَيْذَرٌ, (TA,) The young one of a wild cow: (S,
K:) pl. of the first and second, جَآذِرُ. (S.) ISd
thinks that جَوْدَرٌ and جِيذَرٌ are Arabic, and that
جُؤْذَرٌ and جُؤْذُرٌ are Persian. (TA.) See also
مُجْذِرٌ.
جِيذَرٌ or جَيْذَرٌ: see what next precedes.
مُجْذِرٌ A wild cow having a young one. (ISd,
K.) Hence we decide that the ء in ↓ جؤذر is
augmentative; and because it often occurs as an
augmentative in the second place. (ISd, TA.)
[In the S it is regarded as a radical.]
مَجْذُورٌ: see حَذْرٌ.
