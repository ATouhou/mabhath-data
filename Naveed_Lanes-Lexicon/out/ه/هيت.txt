هيت2
هيّت بِهِ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَهْيِيتٌ, (TA,) as
also هوّت, (S,) He cried out to him, and called
him, (S, K,) saying, هَيْتَ هَيْتَ; or saying يَاهْ يَاهْ,
which is a cry by which a pastor calls his companion from afar; or, accord. to AZ, saying
يَا هَيَا [or rather يَاهَيَاهْ: see art. يه]. (TA.)

هَات Give me: (K:) هَاتِ يَا رَجُلُ Give me,
O man: (T, S, M:) i. q. أَعْطِنِى: (T, S, M,
K:) to two men, هَاتِيَا: to a plurality of men,
هَاتُوا: to a woman, هَاتِى: to two women, هَاتِيَا:
to a plurality of women, هَاتِينَ: you say هَاتِ
لا هَاتَيْتَ [Give me: mayest thou not give (hereafter)! an imprecation, of the like of which there
are many examples]; and هَاتِ إِنْ كَانَتْ بِكَ
مُهَاتَاةٌ [Give me, if there be in thee (a disposition
for) giving]; and مَا أُهاتِيكَ [I do not give thee],
like as you say, مَا أُعَاطِيكَ; but you do not say
هَاتَيْتُ; nor do you use this verb in a prohibitive
manner: [it is used neither affirmatively nor
prohibitively:] accord. to Kh, هَاتِ is from اتَى,
aor. يُوتِى; the ا being changed into ه. (S.)
[But اتَى is of the measure أَفْعَلَ; and هَاتِ is
the imp. from the measure فَاعَلَ. See also art.
هتى, where it is mentioned again in the S
and K.]
هَيْتَ an exclamation denoting wonder: the
Arabs say, هَيْتَ لِلْحِلْمِ [What forbearing mildness, or clemency!] (L.) ―
-b2-  هَيْتَ لَكَ, (Akh, S,
K, &c.,) and هَيْتِ لك, (Akh, K,) and هَيْتَ لك,
(Akh, IB, K,) and the first letter is sometimes
with kesreh; (K;) as is related on the authority of
'Alee, (TA,) [so that you say هِيتَ and هِيتِ and
هِيتُ, the first of which three forms is mentioned
by Fr, Akh, IB, and the third by Fr, IB; but
for the second I find no other authority than
that implied above;] of all which, the most
common is هَيْتَ لك, with fet-hah to the ه and
ت: (Zj:) هَيْتَ is of the dial. of Howrán, whence
it became introduced into Mekkeh; and هِيتَ,
of the dial. of El-Medeeneh: (Fr:) [imper.
verbal ns.] i. q. هَلُمَّ, Come! (Akh, S, L, K,) or
تَعَالَ the same, (Fr, Ks,) or أَقْبِلْ, the same, or
Come forward! (L.) It occurs in the Kur,
xii. 23; where it is commonly read هَيْتَ لَكَ;
(Zj;) but 'Alee and Ibn-'Abbás are said to have
read هِئْتُ لَكَ, with hemzeh. [See art. هيأ.] (TA.)
هَيْتَ is itself invariable whether used to denote
the sing. or pl. or fem. or masc.; but the difference of number is observed in what follows
it; for you say هَيْتَ لَكُمَا [Come ye two!] and
هَيْتَ لَكُنَّ [Come ye women! &c.]: (S:) you
also say simply هَيْتَ [Come!] and this is also
said to signify Hasten! and Set forth journeying through the land, or earth. (TA.) Authorities differ respecting this word; whether it be
Arabic or arabicized; and whether it be a noun
or a verb; &c. Accord. to AZ, as related by
Az, هيت لك is arabicized in the Kur, from the
Hebrew هيتا كخ [app. a mistake for هيتا كخ,
which I suppose to be meant for ??
“ Now, come! ” occurring in Gen. xxxi. 44].
(TA.)
هَيْتَ هَيْتَ: see 2.
هِيتٌ A low, or depressed, piece of ground:
(K:) a piece of ground having a low, or depressed, bottom: (TA:) i. q. هُوَّةٌ and هُوتَةُ.
(IAar.)
هِيتَاءٌ, and هِيتَاه: see art. هوت.
هَيَّاتٌ [Clamorous; calling out often, or much].
(S.)
