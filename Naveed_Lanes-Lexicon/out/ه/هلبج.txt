هلبجهِلْبَاجَةٌ Stupid; foolish; of little sense: (S:)
or one unsurpassed in stupidity, foolishness, or
paucity of sense: or heavy, dull, stupid, and of
little use: (TA:) or a heavy, or dull, man:
(T:) as also هِلْبَاجٌ: (L:) Khalaf El-Ahmar
says, I asked an Arab of the desert respecting
the meaning of هلباجة, and he said, It means a
stupid, or foolish, man, or one of little sense, bulky,
or corpulent, impotent in speech or actions, and
heavy, or dull, or doltish, a great eater, who
who — who —, and he continued to add to his
interpretation something each time; after which
he said to me, desiring to depart, he is one who
comprises every evil quality. (S, K. *)
