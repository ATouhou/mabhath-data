هَضْبٌ A kind, mode, or way. A. Heyth quotes
the following verse of El-Kumeyt, describing a
horse:
مُخَيَّفٌ بَعْضُهُ وَرْدٌ وَسَائِرُهُ
جَوْنٌ أَفَانِينُ إِجْرِيَّاهُ لَا هَضْبُ
The poet means, that his running, or usual running, was of different, or various, kinds; not of
one هضب, or kind. (L.)
-A2-  See هَضْبَةٌ.
هَضَبٌ: see هَضْبَةٌ.
هَضْبَةٌ A rain: (S, K:) or a rain consisting
of many drops: (IAth:) or a lasting rain, consisting of great drops: or a single fall thereof:
(TA:) or hard rain: (Msb:) pl. هِضَبٌ, (S,
K,) like بِدَرٌ pl. of بَدْرَةٌ, (S,) extr. [with respect
to rule], (TA,) and هِضَابٌ, (K,) or this is pl. of
هَضْبٌ accord. to the S; (TA;) and pl. pl.
أَهَاضِيبُ; (K;) or this is pl. of هِضَابٌ, which is
pl. of ↓ هَضْبٌ, signifying fine showers of rain
after other rain; syn. حَلَبَاتُ قَطْرٍ بَعْدَ قَطْرٍ; (AZ,
S;) and this is what is correct: (TA:) or ↓ هَضْبٌ
signifies a fine rain; or a fine shower of rain;
syn. حَلْبَةُ قَطْرٍ: it is also said, in the L, that
↓ أُهْضُوبَةٌ is syn. with هَضْبٌ, [either in one of the
last two senses, or as a coll. gen. n. of which
هَضْبَةٌ is the n. un., which it is said to be below,]
and that اهاضيب is its pl.: ↓ هُضُوبَةٌ also is the
same as اهضوبة: so in the phrase أَصَابَتْهُمُ الهضوبةُ
مِنَ المَطَرِ [The fine shower, or showers, of rain
(or the shower of rain, or of copious rain, or of
lasting rain consisting of large drops, or hard
rain,) fell upon them]; mentioned in the K: it
is also said in the L, that هَضْبٌ forms in the pl.
أَهْضَابٌ, and then أَهَاضِيبُ; like as قَوْلٌ forms
أَقْوَالٌ, and then أَقَاوِيلُ. (TA.) ↓ هَضْبٌ is also
said to be a pl. of هَضْبَةٌ; but it is rather a coll.
gen. n., [of which هَضْبَةٌ is the n. un.]: and هَضَبٌ
is also added to the list of the pls. of the same
word; but this, accord. to the S, on the authority
of AA, is pl. [or rather a quasi-pl. n.] of هَاضِبٌ,
[act. part. n. of 1,] like as تَبَعٌ is of تَابِعٌ, and
بَعَدٌ of بَاعِدٌ. (TA.)
-A2-  هَضْبَةٌ A hill; (IAth:)
or a mountain spreading over the surface of the
ground: (S, Msb, K:) or a mountain composed
of one mass of rock: (K:) or any firm, hard,
large mass of rock: (TA:) or a long inaccessible
mountain, separate from others; but only of red
mountains: (K:) or a hill, such as is termed
أَكَمَة, with few plants, or little herbage: (Msb:)
pl. هِضَبٌ and هِضَابٌ; (S, K;) and pl. pl. أَهَاضِيبُ.
(K, TA.) أَهَاضِبُ is used, by poetical licence,
for اهاضيب, in a poem of one of the Hudhalees:
(TA:) [or it is pl. of أَهْضُبٌ, which is pl. of pauc.
of هَضْبٌ]. هَضْبٌ is also said, in the S, and L, to be
a pl. of هَضْبَةٌ; but it is rather a coll. gen. n.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  An elevated, or overlooking, tract of
sand. (TA, art. طود.)
-A3-  (assumed tropical:)  A run; a single
run. (AHeyth.)
هِضَبٌّ (tropical:)  A horse sweating much; or that sweats
much. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  Hard, or firm, and strong,
or robust. (K.) ―
-b3-  Large, or bulky; as an
epithet applied to the kind of lizard called ضَبّ,
and to other things. (TA.)
غَنَمٌ هَضِيبٌ Sheep or goats having little milk:
(K:) app. form الهَضْبُ, signifying حَلْبَةُ القَطْرِ.
(TA.)
هُضُوبَةٌ: see هَضْبَةٌ.
هَاضِبٌ, used after the manner of a rel. n.,
signifying ذُو هَضْبٍ: so in the following expression in a verse of Aboo-Sakhr El-Hudhalee;
فِى يَوْمٍ مِنَ اللَّهْوِ هَاضِبٍِ; which means In a day
when the people had played much, and quickly:
explained by the words كَانُوا قَدْ هَضَبُوا فِى اللَّهْوِ.
(TA.)
أُهْضُوبَةٌ: see هَضْبَةٌ.
رَوْضَةٌ مَهْضُوبَةٌ [A meadow, or the like, rained
upon: or much wetted by rain]. (TA.)
