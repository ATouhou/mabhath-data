and ↓ هِنْدَبَاءٌ (K: [but it is not there said
whether it be imperfectly or perfectly declinable:
accord. to Ibn-Buzurj, as mentioned in the TA,
it is fem., and therefore imperfectly decl.: but
from the ns. an. given below, it appears to be
masc., and perfectly decl.: probably, therefore,
all the forms of the word ending with long
or short alif may be correctly pronounced without,
and with, tenween:]) and ↓ هِنْدَبَّى (ISk, S, Msb)
and هِنْدِبَاءٌ and هِنْدِبًى; (Az, S, K, Msb;) but

temperament, (مُعْتَدِلَةٌ,) useful for the stomach
and the liver and the spleen, when eaten: and for
the sting of a scorpion, when applied externally,
with its roots: he who cooks it errs more than
he who washes it [and so uses it]. (K.) F
mentions the names of this plant in aro. هندب,
as though the ن were a radical letter, which noone asserts it to be: J [and others], in art.

cites the following verse:
بِدَمْعٍ ذِى حَرَارَاتٍ
عَلَى الخَدَّيْنِ ذِى هَيْدَبْ
[With hot tears upon the cheeks, flowing in a
continued succession]. But it is said in the L,
I have not heard هيدب used as an epithet
applied to rain falling continuously, aor. as an
epithet applied to tears; and the verse which
Lth adduces as an authority is forged. (TA.) ―
