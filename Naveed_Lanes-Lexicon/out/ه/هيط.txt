هِيَاطٌ [in the senses assigned to it in what
here follows] is an inf. n. of which the verb
[هَايَطَ] is obsolete. (L.) You say, مَا زَالَ فِى
هِيَاطٍ وَمِيَاطٍ He ceased not to be in a state of
approaching, or drawing near, and retiring to a
distance: (K:) or هِيَاطٌ signifies the act of
advancing: (Lh:) or هِيَاطٌ and مِيَاطٌ respectively
signify the most vehement driving in coming to
water, and the most vehement driving in returning
from water; and the meaning is, going and
coming: (Aboo-Tálib:) or both signify the being
in a state of commotion, tumult, or disturbance;
as some say, arising from their saying “ No, by
God,” and “ Yes, by God: ” (TA:) [it is also
said that] مُهَايَطَةٌ [which is likewise an inf. n. of
مَايَطَ] signifies the act of crying out, or vociferating; and raising a clamour, or confused
noise; [(see also 1;) and so, app., هِيَاطٌ; for it
is immediately added,] one says, وَقَعَ القَوْمُ فِى
هِيَاطٍ وَمِيَاطٍ [as though meaning the people, or
company of men, fell into vociferating, &c.].
(S.) بَيْنَهُمَا مُهَايَطَةٌ is also said to signify
Between them two is low, faint, or gentle,
speaking. (TA.) [See مِيَاطٌ.] ―
-b2-  Accord. to
IAar, هايطهُ signifies He esteemed him weak.
(TA.)
6
تهايطوا They came together, or coalesced,
and arranged, or adjusted, their affairs; (Fr.,
S, K;) contr. of تمايطوا. (Fr, S.)
هَائِط and مَائِطٌ are explained by IAar as signifying Going and coming. (TA.)
هيع &c.
