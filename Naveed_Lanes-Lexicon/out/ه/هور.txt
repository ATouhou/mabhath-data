water-worn, bank, rising by the bed of a torrent
or stream]; (TA [in which هُؤُورٌ is given as an
inf. n. of this verb; but it is more probably an
inf. n. of the intrans. verb only, agreeably with
analogy;]) as also ↓ هوّرهُ, (S, A,) the pronoun
relating to a building, (A,) and to a جُرْف; (S;)
and هيّرهُ [in illustration of which see what is said
of تهيّر, below]; (S, art. هير;) and ↓ تهوّرهُ, in which

as also ↓ انهار and ↓ تهوّر (S, A, K) and تهيّر, (K,)
