هَلْتَى A certain plant; (S, K;) when it dries,
it becomes red; and when it is eaten, and grows,
it is called جَمِيمٌ: or, accord. to Az, a certain
tree, growing like the صِلِّيَان, except that its colour
inclines to red: or, accord. to Aboo-Ziyád, as
AHn says, a plant of the kind called طَرِيفَة,
growing like the صلّيان and the نَصِىّ, red when
fresh and moist, and more red when it has dried:
it is watery; and the camels and sheep &c. scarcely
ever eat it when they find any other herbage to
serve them in its stead. (TA.)
هُلَاتَةٌ The black filth that is washed away from
the membrane which encloses a young lamb or kid
in its mother's womb. (K, TA.) [For غُسَالَةُ
السَّخْلَةِ السَّوْدَاءِ, as in the copies of the K in my
hands, I read السوداءُ. ―
-b2-  See also هُلَابَةٌ.]
هَلْتَاتٌ [accord. to the TA and a MS. copy of
the K: in the CK هُلْتَاتٌ:] A company of people
staying, or abiding, in a place; and of people
journeying. (K.) So accord. to AZ; but accord.
to ISk, with ث. (L.)
