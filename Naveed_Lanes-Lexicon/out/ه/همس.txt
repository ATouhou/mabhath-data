هَمِسَ, (A, TA,) inf. n. هَمْس
(AHeyth, L, TA) and هَمِيسٌ and هُمُوسٌ, (L,
TA,) He spoke inaudibly: (AHeyth, TA:) or in a
low, faint, gentle, or soft, manner, (AHeyth, TA,)
so as to be hardly intelligible. (TA.) It is said
in a trad. فَجَعَلَ بَعْضُنَا يَهْمِسُ إِلَى بَعْضٍ And
some of us began to speak to others in a low,
faint, gentle, or soft, manner, so as to be hardly
intelligible. (TA.) And in another trad., كَانَ
ذَا إِصَلَّى العَصْرَ هَمَسَ بِشَىْءٍ لَا نَفْهَمُهُ He used,
when he performed the afternoon-prayer, to utter
something in a low, faint, gentle, or soft manner,
we not understanding it. (TA.) You say also,
هَمَسَ إِلَىَّ بِحَدِيثِهِ [He uttered his discourse to
me inaudibly: or in a low, faint, gentle, or soft,
manner.] (A.) And الشَّيْطَانُ يَهْمِسُ بِوَسْوَسَتِهِ صَدْرَ
الإِنْسَانِ [The devil speaks inaudibly in his suggesting vain or unprofitable things into the bosom
of man]. (A.) And هَمَسَ الشَّيْطَانُ فِى الصَّدْرِ
The devil suggested vain, or unprofitable things
in the bosom; syn. وَسْوَسَ. (TA.) See also
هَمْسٌ below. ―
-b2-  Also, aor. and inf. n. as above,
He made the faintest, or slightest, sound in treading. So in the saying, إِهْمِسْ وَصَهْ and هَمْسًا وَصَهْ
Make thou the faintest, or slightest, sound in
treading, and be thou silent: addressed by a thief
to his companion. (TA.) And hence the saying
of the Rájiz,
فَهُنَّ يَمْشِينَ بِهِ هَمِيسَا
And they walk with him making the faintest, or
slightest, sound in treading. (S.) هَمِيسٌ also
signifies The walking softly; with a soft-sounding tread: (TA:) [and so هَمْسٌ; as in the saying,] سَمِعْتُ هَمْسَ الأَخْفَافِ وَالأَقْدَامِ [I heard
the soft-sounding treading of the feet of camels
and of the feet of men]. (A.) See also هَمْسٌ
below.
-A2-  هَمَسَ الصَّوْتَ, aor.
هَمِسَ, inf. n. هَمْسٌ,
He made the sound, or voice to be low, faint,
gentle, or soft. (Msb.) And هَمَسَ الكَلَامَ, [aor.
and] inf. n. as above, [He spoke in a low, faint,
gentle, or soft manner; like هَمَسَ alone; lit.,]
he made speech, or the speech to be low, faint,
gentle, or soft. (A, TA.)
-A3-  هَمَسَ الطَّعَامَ, (TK),
[aor. and] inf. n. as above, (AZ, K,) He chewed
the food with the mouth closed: (AZ, K, TA:)
or without opening the mouth. (TA.) You say,
هُوَ يَْكُلُ هَمْسًا He eats without opening his mouth.
(A.) Hence, a toothless old woman's eating is
termed هَمْسٌ. (AHeyth.) هَمَسَهُ also signifies
[simply] He chewed it. (TA.)
3
هامسهُ, inf. n. مُهَامَسَةٌ, He spoke, or discoursed secretly to him, or with him. (A.) You

تَهَاْمَسَ see 3.
هَمْسٌ A low, faint, gentle, or soft, sound. (S,
A, Msb, K.) So it has been explained as occurring in the words of the Kur, [xx. 107,] فَلَا
تَسْمَعُ إِلَّا هَمْسًا [So that thou shalt not hear
aught save] a low, faint, gentle, or soft, sound,
arising from the shifting of the feet from place to
place towards the scene of congregation [for the
general judgment]: or, as Az thinks, the meaning here is, the sound of the patting, or pattering,
of the feet (خَفْقَ الأَقْدَامِ) upon the ground.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  The faint, or gentle, sound of the voice
in the mouth, of such kind as has no mixture of
the voice of the chest, nor loudness of utterance.
(Lth, K.) See also مَهْمُوسٌ. ―
-b3-  And Anything
low, faint, gentle, or soft, (كُلُّ خَفِىٍّ, K, TA,)
of speech and the like: (TA:) [see again, مَهْمُوسٌ:]
or the faintest, or slightest, sound of the feet;
(S, K;) i. e., of their tread upon the ground:
(TA:) so [accord. to J] in the instance in the
Kur, [xx. 107,] mentioned above: (S:) and
[in like manner] ↓ هَمِيسٌ signifies the sound of
the shifting from place to place of the feet of
camels. (K.) See also 1.
هَمِيسٌ: see 1: and see هَمْسٌ.
كَلَامٌ مَهْمُوسٌ [Speech spoken inaudibly: or
in a low, faint, gentle, or soft manner, so as to be
hardly intelligible: see 1: or] speech not spoken
out or openly. (A, * Msb.) ―
-b2-  حَرْفٌ مَهْمُوسٌ,
(Msb,) or حَرْفُ الهَمْسِ, (IJ,) [A letter which is
pronounced with the breath only, without the
voice; a non-vocal letter; a sound with which
the breath passes forth, not from the voice of the
chest, but passing forth gently; (IJ;) contr. of
مَجْهُورٌ: (Msb:) الحُرُوفُ المَهْمُوسَةُ are the letters
(ten in number, S,) which are comprised in the
saying حَثَّهُ شَخْصٌ فَسَكَتْ: (S, K: *) so called
[accord. to some] because the stress is made
weak in the place where any one of them occurs
until the breath has passed forth with it. (Sb, S.)
