became sunk in its socket, (As, S) In the
saying of the daughter of El-Khuss, when she

to have shaken, or moved to and fro, and she
walks, and straddles in doing so], هاجّ may be
[an act. part. n.] formed from هَجَّتْ, although
this form of the verb be not used; and
she makes العين masc., meaning thereby العُضْو
or الطَّرْف; for properly she should have said
هَاجَّة: or هاجّ is used [instead of هَجَّجَّتْ] in
im-cation of راجّ [and تفاجّ]. (L.)
