هلجإِهْلِيلَجٌ (IAar, S, K) and إِهْلِيلِجٌ, (Fr, Sh, K,)
but this is disapproved by IAar, who observes
that there are no words in Arabic of the measure
إِفْعِيلِلٌ, but there are of the measure إِفْعِيلَلٌ, as
إِهْلِيلَجٌ and إِبْرِيسَمٌ and إِطْرِيفَلٌ, (S,) and هَلِيلَجٌ,
(L,) but this is disallowed by ISk, (S,) [a coll.
gen. n.,] n. un. with ة, (K,) an arabicized word,
(S,) from اهليله, (TA,) [or rather هلِيلَهْ, a Persian word,] A well-known fruit, [the fruit of the
myrobalan, as well as the myrobalan-tree,] one
kind of which is yellow, (K,) and another kind
black, the latter being in the highest state of ripeness, and another kind called كَابُلِىٌّ: it is useful
as a remedy for quinseys, and preserves the intel-lect, and removes the head-ache, (when used made
into a conserve, TA,) and is, in the stomach, like
an intelligent housewife, who is a good manager,
in the house: (K, TA; but omitted in some
copies of the K:) so is this medicine to the brain
and stomach. (TA.) [See also بِلِيلَجٌ, in art.
بلج.]
