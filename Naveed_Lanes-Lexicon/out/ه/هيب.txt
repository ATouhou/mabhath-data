-b2-  هَيَّبَانٌ (K) or [rather]
↓ هَيِّبَانٌ, (TA, [see هَائِبٌ]) A he-goat: (K:)
explained by the word تَيْسٌ; but this is a
signification not found [by SM] elsewhere, and
appears to be a mistake for مَنْتَفِشٌ; for in the
L and other lexicons we find the word explained
by مُنْتَفِشٌ خَفِيفٌ, Scattered, and light; with a
citation of the following verse of Dhu-r-Rummeh:
تَمُجُّ اللُّغَامَ الهَيَِّبَانَ كَأَنَّهُ
جَنَى عُشَرٍ تَنْفِيهِ أَشْدَاقُهَا الهُدْلُ
[She ejects from her mouth the scattered and
light froth, as though it were plucked fruit of the
'oshar which the flabby sides of her mouth cast
forth:] and we also find, in the R, قُطْنٌ هيّبانٌ
explained as signifying cotton that is plucked, or
teased with the fingers, so as to become scattered;
syn. منتفش: or هيّبان signifies, in the abovecited verse, accord. to some, Light, [which
signification is also given in the K, but in the
CK displaced; following, instead of preceding,
the word الرَّاعِى, and without و before it;] and
separated into small particles: (TA:) [or] the
froth of the mouth of camels; (Az, K;) i. q.
لُغَامٌ: (Mj, Sifr es-Sa'ádeh:) Az cites the above
verse; and says, that the fruit of the عُشَر [or
asclepias gigantea] comes forth like a small
pomegranate, and, when burst open, discloses
what resembles [white] raw silk; to which the
poet likens the froth of the camel's mouth.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  هَيَّبَانٌ (or هَيِّبَانٌ, TA,) A pastor. (K,
from Es-Seeráfee.) [Accord. to the CK, a light,
or an active pastor: but see above.] ―

(K.) This is the original [simple] epithet. (TA.)
―
-b2-  The following, which are explained in the K
in the same manner as the above, are intensive
epithets: (TA:) namely ↓ هَيُوبٌ (S, K) and
هَيُوبَةٌ, (S, L,) [in which the ة is added to strengthen
the intensiveness,] and ↓ هَيَّابٌ and هَيَّابَةٌ, (S,
K,) in which ة is added for the purpose above
mentioned, (TA,) and ↓ هَيِّبٌ, (K,) which may be
contracted into هَيْتٌ, (TA,) and ↓ هَيْبَانٌ (K) and
↓ هَيِّبَانٌ (S, K) and ↓ هَيَّبَانٌ; (K;) of which last
two forms, the latter only is admitted by some
of the learned; but MF admits only the former
of them; asserting فَيْعَلَانٌ to be unknown as the
measure of an unsound word, like as فيَعِلَان is
unknown as that of a sound word except in extr.
instances; (TA;) [Having much reverence, veneration, dread, or awe; much fear; much
cautious fear, or caution:] fearing men [much]:
(K:) a coward, who regards men with awe, or
fear, &c.: (S:) [The last of these epithets is
also explained in the CK as signifying having
much fear, or very fearful; (كَثِيرُ الخَوْفِ;) and
a coward: but in the TA and in a MS copy of the
K, الخوف is omitted; and in the TA is added
by the author, after كثير, the words من كلّ
شىُ; as though the meaning of the word were
“ much, or many, of any things: ” the correct
reading seems to be the former, and the meaning intended by SM, having much fear, or very
fearful, of everything: in like manner] ↓ هَيُوبٌ
signifies a man who fears everything. (TA.) ―
-b3-
↓ الإِيمَانُ هَيُوبٌ [Faith is fearful, or very fearful; i. e.,] he who possesses faith fears acts of

with reverence, &c.; i. e.,] he who possesses faith
is feared, or regarded with reverence, &c.: in
which case هيوب is used in the sense of a pass.
