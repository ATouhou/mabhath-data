هرمتهَرَامِيتُ Wells: (K;) a pl. that has no sing.;
or its sing. is هِرْمِيتٌ or هُرْمُوتٌ; or perhaps the
ت is an augmentative letter: (MF:) or, accord.
to the L, it is a name of a certain group of wells
in the tract of Ed-Dahma, said to have been dug
by Lukmán the son of 'Ád: or, accord. to As,
certain wells on the left of Dareeyeh: if so, F has
erred in prefixing to it the art. ال. (TA.)
