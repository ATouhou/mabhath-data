-b7-  MF says, on the authority of the etymologists, that the original signification of ↓ تَهْذِيبٌ
and هَذْبٌ is The clearing, or trimming, of trees,
by cutting off the extremities of the branches, in
order that they may increase in growth and
beauty; that they were then used to signify the
cleansing, or purifying, of anything; and putting
it into a right, or proper, state; trimming it;
or adjusting it; and clearing it of any dirty or
filthy things, or the like, mixed with it; so that
these became their proper meanings by general
acceptation: and that they were then used to
signify the trimming and embellishing of verse,
and clearing it of whatever might vitiate it in the
opinion of the chaste in language, and the philologists: but the truth is what is said in the L;
that the original signification of تهذيب is the
clearing the colocynth of its pulp, and preparing
its seeds so that they may lose their bitterness, and
become sweet. (TA.)
