هنبهَنَبٌ [probably an inf. n., of which the verb
is هَنِبَ, aor.
هَنَبَ,] Weakness of understanding;
want of discrimination; stupidity; foolishness;
littleness of sense. (S.)
هَنَبَى &c.: see هُنَّبَاءُ.
هُنَّبَاءُ (incorrectly written by J, in a verse
which he quotes, هَنْبَاءُ, K, TA; but in an old
and excellent copy of the S, I find the word
written هَنَباءُ;]) and هُنَّبَى (K) and هَنَبَاءُ and
↓ هَنَبَى (IDrd, K) A woman of weak understanding; without discrimination; stupid; foolish;
of little sense: (S, K:) accord. to some, as mentioned in a note by Aboo-Zekereeya, in the S, in
this art., هُنَبَى signifies an insane woman; or
one possessed by a jinnee. (TA.) هُنَّبَاءُ is the
only word of the measure فُعَّلَاءُ known to Az.
(TA.) Accord. to the K, IDrd writes إِمْرَأَةٌ هَنَبَاءُ
and هَنَبَى: but this is [thought to be] a mistake:
he gives the two forms هُنَّبَاءُ and هُنَّبَى, as stated
by IM and others; and, app., هَنَبَى. (TA.) ―
-b2-
The first and second of these three words also
signify A man who is stupid, foolish, or of little
sense. (K.)
مِهْنَبٌ Exceedingly stupid, or foolish. (IAar,
Az, K.)
