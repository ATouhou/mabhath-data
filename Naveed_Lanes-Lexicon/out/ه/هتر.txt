هتر1
هَتَرَهُ, aor.
هَتِرَ, (K, TA,) like يَضْرِبُ, (TA [in
the CK, ??, but this is evidently a mistake,]) It
(old age, K, TA, and disease and grief, TA),
made him to be such as is called مُهْتَرٌ; [i. e.,
made him to lose his reason, or intellect: or to be
addicted to, or fond of, speaking of a thing:
which latter signification seems to be particularly indicated in the lexicon from which this
is taken; but the former seems the more appropriate.] (K.)
3
هاترهُ, [inf. n. مُهَاتَرَةٌ and هِتَارٌ,] He encountered him with mutual reviling, saying what was
false: (K, * TA:) so says IAmb, on the
authority of AZ; but, says Th, accord. to others,
المُهَاتَرَةُ signifies the saying [that] whereof one
part contradicts, or annuls, another: and hence
one says, دَعِ الهِتَارَ [leave the saying that whereof
one part contradicts another]. (TA.)
4
أُهْتِرَ He became disordered in his intellect:
(A, TA:) or he became so by reason of old age:
(S:) or he lost his reason from old age, (AZ,
A'Obeyd, K,) as also ↓ إِسْتَهْتَرَ, (AZ, TA,) or
from disease, or grief; as also أَهْتَرَ. (K.) See
also 10, in two places.
5
تهتّر He was, or became, stupid, and
ignorant. (K: but only the inf. n. is there
mentioned.)
6
تهاترا They accused each other falsely. (S,
A, Mgh, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  And hence, تهاترت
البَيِّنَاتُ, (Msb,) and الشَّهَادَاتُ, (A, Mgh,) The
testimonies, or evidences, became null: (Mgh,
Msb:) or belied one another. (A.)
10
إِسْتَهْتَرَ: see 4. ―
-b2-  He was, or became,
much given to false, or vain, sayings, or actions.
(TA [but this seems rather to be أُسْتُهْتِرَ: see its
part. n., below.]) ―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  He followed his own
natural desire, not caring what he did. (Msb
[but this also seems to be in the pass. form.]) ―
-b4-
أُسْتُهْتِرَ بِكَذَا (tropical:)  He became addicted to, or fond of,
such a thing, (K, TA,) not talking of any other
thing, (TA,) nor caring what was done to him,
(K, TA,) nor how he was reviled: (K:) he
became addicted to, or fond of, such a thing, not
talking of, nor doing, any other thing: and he
became fascinated by such a thing, and lost his
reason on account of it, and his strong determination became turned towards it, so that he
talked much and vainly respecting it. (TA.) ―
-b5-
إِسْتَهْتَرَ بِفُلَانَةَ, [or أُسْتُهْتِرَ,] and بِهَا ↓ أَهْتَرَ, [or أُهْتِرَ,]
(tropical:)  He [became attached, or devoted, to such a
woman so that he] cared not what was said of
him on her account, nor how he was reviled:
(A, TA:) and ↓ أُهْتِرَ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  he became
addicted or given to, or fond of, speaking of a
thing. (K.)
هُتْرٌ The loss of reason from old age or disease
or grief. (K.)
هِتْرٌ An error in speech. (S, A, Mgh, Msb,
K.) You say, جَآءَ بِهِتْرٍ مِنَ القَوْلِ He uttered
an error of speech. (A.) And ↓ هِتْرٌ هَاتِرٌ A
great error of speech. (S, K. *) ―
-b2-  A falsehood;
a lie. (K.) You say, قَوْلٌ هِتْرٌ A false saying
(TA.)
هَاتِرٌ: see هِتْرٌ.
تَهَاتِرُ Testimonies, or evidences, that belie one
another: as though pl. of تَهْتَرٌ: (K:) or any
evidences, or testimonies, that are not legal proofs
(Mgh [but in my copy of that work written
تَهاتُر.])
مُهْتَرٌ Disordered in his intellect, (S,) or having
lost his reason, (AZ, A'Obeyd, K,) from old age.
(AZ, A'Obeyd, S, K,) or from disease, or
grief: (K:) if from أَهْتَرَ, it is anomalous. (K,

given to, or fond of, speaking of a thing (K.)
