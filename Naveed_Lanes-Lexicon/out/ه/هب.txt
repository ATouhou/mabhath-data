هَبَبْتُهُ in this sense is a mistake: but MF remarks,
that what J says is ↓ هَبْهَبْتُهُ, he (MF) having
examined many copies of the S and found them all
alike in this case, and that this is correct; and
this is the reading that I find in both of M.
Fresnel's copies of the S: see also تَهَبْهَبَ, given
in the S as quasi-passive of هَبْهَبْتُهُ SM, however,
states in the TA, that the reading found by him
in a copy of the S in the handwriting of Yákoot,
the author of the Moajam, collated with the copy
of Aboo-Zekereeya Et-Tebreezee and that of
Aboo-Sahl El-Harawee, is هببت به, as in the K;
and this, he says, is the genuine reading.]

commotion]. (A.)
-A2-  اهبّه (assumed tropical:)  He awoke him, or
roused him, from his sleep. (S.) ↓ هَبَّهُ is said to
signify the same; and in proof thereof is adduced
a reading in the Kur, deviating from that which
is universally received as correct; مَنْ هَبَّنَا مِن
مَّرْقَدِنَا, instead of مَنْ بَعَثَنَا, Who hath roused us
from our sleeping-place? [ch. xxxvi., v. 52;] but
IJ rejects this reading, unless it be elliptical, for
هَبَّ بِنَا. (TA.)
