from the evil suggestions of the devils. (A.)
-A3-
(tropical:)  He blamed, upbraided, or reproached, him; he
found fault with him; syn. of the inf. n. عَيْبٌ,
(Fr, in TA, art. لمز; and IAar, in TA, in the
present art.) as also لَمْزٌ: (Fr, in TA, art. لمز;
and S,) or he spoke evil of him, or spoke of him
in a manner that he disliked, mentioning vices or
faults as chargeable to him, behind his back,
though it might be with truth; syn. إِغْتَابَهُ فِى

هَمِزَ, inf. n. هَمْزٌ, (Msb,) [He pronounced the word with the sound termed هَمْز, or
هَمْزَة, of which the sign is ء,] is from هَمَزَهُ in the
first of the senses explained above; (S, Msb,)
because what is termed هَمْز in speech, (S,) or
هَمْزَة, (Kh, TA,) [i. e. the sound so called,] is
[as it were] pressed, or squeezed, (Kh, S, TA,)
from its place of utterance [by a sudden emission
of the voice forced out after a compression of
the passage whereby it has been stopped]. (Kh,
TA.) It was said to an Arab of the desert,
أَتَهْمِزُ الفَأْرَةَ, [meaning Dost thou pronounce الفَأْرَة
with hemz, or hemzeh?] and he said, [understanding the words to mean dost thou squeeze the
rat, or mouse?] السِّنَّوْرُ يَهْمِزُهَا [The cat squeezes
it]. (S.) See هَمْزٌ, below. [And see also نَبَرَ.]

انهمز [quasi-pass. of هَمَزَهُ; It was pressed,
squeezed, or pinched: he was pushed, &c. The
first of these significations is indicated, or implied, in the JK and the TA.] ―
-b2-  انهمز الحَرْفُ
[The word was pronounced with the sound termed
هَمْز, or هَمْزَة]. (S.)
هَمْزُ الشَّيْطَانِ was explained by Mohammad as
meaning (tropical:)  Madness, or insanity; syn. مُوتَةٌ, i. e.
جُنُونٌ; because it arises from the goading and
pressing or pinching of the devil. (A 'Obeyd,
K.) See 1; and see also هَمَزَات, voce هَمْزَةٌ.
-A2-
هَمْزٌ, (S,) and هَمْزَةٌ, (Kh, TA,) [the former a gen.
n., and the latter the n. un.,] The sister of alif; one
of the letters of the alphabet; [written thus;] a
genuine word, old, heard [from the Arabs of
classical times], and well known; so called for a
reason mentioned above: see 1, last signification:
so says Kh; therefore no regard is due to what is
said in certain of the expositions of the Keshsháf,
that the term همزة thus used has not been heard
[from any of the Arabs of classical times], and
that its name is أَلْفٌ: (TA:) several persons
say, that the term همزة is mostly applied to the
movent [alif], and الف to the quiscent letter.
(MF, TA.) See the letter ا.
هَمْزَةٌ n. un. of هَمْزٌ, q. v. ―
-b2-  هَمَزَاتُ الشَّيَاطِينِ
(tropical:)  The vain suggestions of the devils, which they
inspire into the mind of a man. (S, TA.) See
also 1; and see هَمْزٌ.
هُمَزَةٌ i. q. غَمَّازٌ; (K;) i. e., (TA,) One who
blames, upbraids, reproaches, or finds fault with,
others, much, or habitually; (S, TA;) as also
↓ هَمَّازٌ (S, TA) and ↓ هَامِزٌ; (S, K;) and so
لُمَزَةٌ: (S, K, art. لمز:) [or rather] the first and
second are intensive epithets (TA) [but the third
is not intensive]: or one who backbites his
brother; as also ↓ هَمَّازٌ: (Lth, A, TA:) or one
who defames men (يَخْلُفُهُمْ مِنْ وَرَائِهِمْ وَبَأْكُلُ
لُحُومَهُمْ); and the action thus signified is like
غِيبَةٌ, and may be [by making signs] with the side
of the mouth, and with the eye, and with the
head; as also ↓ هَمَّازٌ: (TA:) or, conjointly with
لُمَزَةٌ, one who speaks evil of men, or backbites
them, and defames them: (Aboo-Is-hák, TA:)
or both together, one who goes about much, or
habitually, with calumny, or slander, separating
companions and exciting enmity between friends:
(Abu-l-'Abbás, TA:) هُمَزَةٌ is applied to a man
and to a woman; (S, TA;) [like لَمُزَةٌ;] for its
ة is to denote intensiveness, and not the fem.
gender: (TA:) ↓ هُمَّازٌ [which is the pl. of هَامِزٌ]
signifies persons who blame, upbraid, reproach,
or find fault with, others behind their backs,
much, or habitually: (IAar, TA:) [or, more
correctly, it has not an intensive signification.]

or of مِهْمَزٌ, is also applied to An instrument, or
