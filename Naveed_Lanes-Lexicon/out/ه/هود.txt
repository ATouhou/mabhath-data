(S, A, L, Msb, K,) A certain tribe; [namely, the
Jews:] (L:) يَهُودُ is said by some to be originally يَهُوذُ, and arabicized by the change of ذ
into د; but ISd disapproves of this assertion:
others say, that it is from هَادَ “ he repented: ”
(L:) it is imperfectly decl., because it is a proper
name and of the measure of a verb; and [of the
fem. gen., as it is said to be in the S and L,]
because it means a قَبِيلَة: but it is allowable to
prefix to it the art. ال, and to say اليَهُودُ: (Msb:)
this, however, is allowable only on the ground
of its being, with the art. prefixed, for اليَهُودِيُّونَ;
for it is of itself determinate: (S, L:) [thus]
يَهُودُ is [as it were] pl. of ↓ يَهُودِىٌّ; (L;) which is
the rel. n. of يهود, or, accord. to Sgh, of يَهُودَا
[or Judah], thus written by him with the unpointed د in this instance, the son of يَعْقُوب [or
Jacob]: (Msb:) يَهُودُ (sometimes, TA) has
يَهْدَانٌ as a pl.: (K:) this pl. occurs in a poem
of Hassán: (TA:) Fr, says, of هُودًا, in the Kur,
ii, 105, that it is for يَهُودًا [app. a mistake for
يَهُودَ]; or that it may be pl. of هَائِدٌ. (L.)
يَهُودِىٌّ: see يَهُودُ.
اليَهُودِيَّةُ The Jewish religion. (L.)
