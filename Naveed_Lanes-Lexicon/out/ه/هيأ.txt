هيأ1
هَآءَ, aor. يَهَآءُ and يَهِيْءُ, (K; the latter not of
respectable authority, Lh;) inf. n. هَيْئَةٌ, He was,
or became, of good, or goodly, form or appearance,
or other properties denoted by the term هَيْئَة, q. v.
(K.) ―
-b2-  [هَيُؤَ, accord. to the K, signifies the
same: but see below.] ―
-b3-  هَيُؤَ, accord. to IHsh
and others, the only verb of this form whose
medial radical letter is ى: (MF:) accord. to the
K, syn. with هَآءَ, in a sense indicated above:
but IJ states that it has a superlative sense;
that it is to be classed with قَضُوَ “ excellent [or
how excellent (see بَطُؤَ voce بُطَآنَ)] is he in his
judging! ” and رَمُوَ “ excellent [or how excellent]
is he in his throwing, or shooting! ” [wherefore
it signifies Excellent, or how excellent, is he in his
form or appearance! &c.;] and that it is, like
قَضُوَ [and رَمُوَ], invariable [as to person, tense,
and mood]. He observes that, as a verb of the
measure فَعُلَ is formed from one whose final
radical letter is ى, [as قَضُوَ and رَمُوَ from قَضَى
and رَمَى,] so is this formed on the same measure
from a verb whose medial radical letter is ى:
and that it is invariable [as to person, tense, and
mood,] because of its resemblance, in its superlative sense, to the class of verbs of wonder, and
to نِعْمَ and بِئْسَ. He further remarks, that they
[the Arabs] have abstained from forming a verb
on the measure فَعُلَ [variable as to person, tense,
and mood,] from one whose medial radical letter
is ى, fearing to make what is difficult to pronounce still more so; for in that case they would
be obliged to say أَبُوعُ بُعْتُ, and بُوعَا; and, as
would also happen if a variable verb of the same
measure were formed from one whose final
radical letter is ى, the change of ى into و, which
is more difficult to pronounce, would thus become
frequent. (TA.) ―

thing that passes away from one, or escapes
him: (S, TA:) or, (as some say, TA,)
an expression of wonder: (K:) see also
يَاشَىْءِ and يَافَىْءَ, which are syn. with يَاهَىْءَ:
(TA:) or هَىْءَ, (accord. to certain of the lexicologists, as related by IB, TA,) is an imperative
verbal noun, signifying Attend! (تَنَبَّهْ); like صَهْ,
which signifies “ Be silent! ” (K;) the interjection يا being put before it in like manner as it
is in the saying of Esh-Shemmakh,
أَلَا يَا اسْقِيَانِى قَبْلَ غَارَةِ سَنْجَالِ
[Come now! O, give me to drink, before the
expedition of Sinjáb!]; (TA;) and هىء being
indeclinable, with a vowel for its termination
to obviate the occurrence of two quiescent
letters, and with fet-hah as the final vowel
because it is more easy of pronunciation than
the others in this case. (K, TA.) ―
