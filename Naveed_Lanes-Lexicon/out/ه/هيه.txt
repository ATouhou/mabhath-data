and هِيهِ and هِيهٍ: see إِيهَ and ايهِ and
إِيهٍ
هَيْهَاتَ كَذَا
Far, or far from being believed
or from the truth, is such a thing; as also هَيْهَاتَ
لِكَذَا: or the latter means remoteness, or remoteness from being believed or from the truth, is to
be attributed to such a thing:
هَيْهَاتَ followed
by لِ means بَعُدَ, (Jel, in xxiii. 38,) or بَعُدَ
التَّصْدِيقُ or الصِّحَّةُ: (Bd, ibid:) or البُعْدُ: (Bd,
ibid, TA:) and without لِ after it, it denotes
the pronouncing [a thing] remote. (TA.) See
أَيْهَاتَ. ―
-b2-  هَيْهَات denotes one's deeming a thing
remote, or improbable, and despairing of it; and
means بَعُدَ جِدًّا [Very far, &c.], or ما أَبْعَدَ
[How far, &c.]; implying more than بَعُدَ
though we render it by this word. (Kull,
p. 382.)
