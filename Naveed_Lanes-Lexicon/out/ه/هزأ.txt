هزأ1
هَزَأَ مِنْهُ, (K,) and بِهِ; (S, K;) and هَزِئَ
(S, K) followed by منه and به; (Akh, S;) but
accord. to Yoo, we should say هزئ به only;
not منه; (TA;) aor.
هَزَاَ, inf. n. هُزْءٌ and هُزُؤٌ (S, K)
and هُزُوْءٌ (TA) and مَهْزَأَةٌ; (S, K;) and به ↓ تهزّأ,
(AZ, S, K,) and به ↓ استهزأ; (S, K;) He
mocked at, scoffed at, laughed at, derided, or
ridiculed, him. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  The most approved
reading of ↓ مُسْتَهْزِئُونَ in the Kur, ii. 13, is with
the ء fully pronounced: some alleviate it: and
some read مُسْتَهْزِيُرنَ: and some مُسْتَهْزُونَ; (but
this pronunciation is of weak authority;) and
say إِسْتَهْزَيْتُ for إِسْتَهْزَأْتُ. (Zj.) ―
-b3-  السَّرَابُ يَهْزَأُ
بِالرَّكْبِ (tropical:)  [The mirage mocks the company of
riders]. (A.)
-A2-  هَزَأَ, (K,) inf. n. هَزْءٌ, (TA,) He,
or it, broke a thing. (K.) ―
-b2-  A poet says, describing a coat of mail,
لَهَا عُكَنْ تَرُدُّ النَّبْلَ خَنْسًا
وَتَهْزَأُ بِالْمَعَابِلِ وَالقِطَاعِ
[It has creases that repel the arrows, making
them to recede, and break the broad and long
arrow-heads, and those which are small and
broad]. The ب in بالمعابل is redundant. This is
the opinion of the lexicologists, except ISd, who
thinks that this is an error, and that تهزأ here
means “ mocks. ” (TA.)
-A3-  هَزَأَ إِبِلَهُ (K; but it is
thought that this may be a mistake for هَرَأَ, TA,)
inf. n. هَزْءٌ; (TA;) and ↓ اهزأ ها; (K;) He
killed his camels with cold. IAar says, that
اهزأهُ البَرْدُ and اهرأهُ both signify The cold killed
him. (TA.)
-A4-  هَزَأَ He put in motion, [or excited,)
the beast on which he rode. (As, K.)
-A5-  هَزَأَ
and هَزِئَ He died (K) in his place, or on the
spot; i. e. unexpectedly, or suddenly: (Z:) improperly objected against by Ibn-Es-Sáïgh.
('Ináyeh, MF.)
