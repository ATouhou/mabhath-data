هندزهِنْدَازٌ, (S, K,) with kesr, (K,) found in the
work of Az, in several places, written with fet-h,
[هَنْدَازٌ,] (TA,) A limit; syn. حَدٌّ: (K:) [or
rather a measure:] an arabicized word, from
أَنْدَازَه, (S, K,) with fet-h, (K,) which is Persian:
(S:) the arabicized word is with kesr to the
first letter because of the rareness of the measure
فَعْلَالٌ in the cases of words not reduplicative.
(K.) You say, أَعَطٰاهُ بِلَا حِسَابِ وَلَا هِنْدَازٍ [He
gave to him without calculation and without
measure]. (S.)
هِنْدَازَةٌ The cubit with which [certain] cloths
and the like are measured; [about twenty-five
inches in length:] also a Persian word arabicized.
(TA.)
مُهَنْدزٌ One who determines the measures and
proportions of subterranean channels for water,
and of buildings: [an architect: and also a geometrician:] from هِنْدَازٌ: but they change the ز into
س, (S, K,) and say مُهَنْدِسٌ, (S,) because there
is not in the [genuine] language of the Arabs a
ز with a د before it. (S, K.)
