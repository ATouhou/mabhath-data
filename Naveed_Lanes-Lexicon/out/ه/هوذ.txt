هوذالهَوْذَةُ, (L, K,) or هَوْذَةُ, [without the art. ال,
as a proper name,] (S, L,) written by Ed-Demeeree with damm, but fault has been found with
him for this, (MF,) [The bird called] the قَطَاة:
(S, L, K:) or, as some say, the female قطاة: (L:)
or هَوْذَةُ, (as a determinate noun) is the name of
a certain bird, (L, K,) different from the above:
(L:) pl. هُوَذٌ, (as in the CK and a MS copy of
the K) or هَوْذٌ, formed by eliding the augmentative letter: (TA:) [and this seems to be the
correct reading; for it occurs in a verse, cited in
the TA, in which the measure required it to be
of one syllable: it therefore appears that هَوْذٌ is
a coll. gen. n., of which the n. un. is with ة.]
