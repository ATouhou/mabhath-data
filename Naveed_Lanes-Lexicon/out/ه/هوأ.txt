below.

هاوأهُ He contended with him for superior glory: like هَاوَاهُ. (IAar.) [See also art.
هوى.]
هَآءِ, هَآءَ, هَأْ, &c. ―
-b2-  هَاءِ, with kesr, is syn. with
هَاتِ, Give; [or changed from this verb;] and
is thus inflected: sing. masc. هَآءِ, fem. هائِى;
dual. masc. and fem. هَائِيَا; pl. masc. هَاؤُوا, fem.
هَائِينَ: (S, K: like هَاتُوا; هَاتِيَا; هَاتِى, هَاتِ,
هَاتِينَ: ء holding the place of ت: S.) ―
-b3-  But
هَآءَ, with fet-h, is syn. with هَاكَ, Take; [or
changed from this word;] and is thus inflected:
sing. masc. هَآءَ, fem. هَآءِ, without ى; dual masc.
and fem. هَاؤُمَا; pl. masc. هَاؤُمُ, [so in the K,
and so I find it in one copy of the S: in another
copy of the latter, هَاؤُمُ, as it is pronounced
before a conjunctive ا; for instance, in the Kur,
lxix, 19:] fem. هَاؤُنَّ, (S, K:) or هَاؤُمْنَ: (L:)
[which last does not exactly correspond with the
model هَاكُنَّ: but I think it most probable that
هَاكُنَّ is changed by idghám from هَاكُمْنَ; and
in like manner, that هَاؤُنَّ is changed from
هَاؤُمْنَ:] (like هَاكَ, هَاكِ; هَاكُمَا; هَاكُمْ, هَاكُنَّ:
هَوُاَ holding the place of ك: S:) also, sing. masc.
هَأْ (originally هَآءُ, S), fem. هَائِى; dual masc. (S)
and fem. (S, K) هَاآ; (S, K;) pl. masc. هَاؤُوا,
(S,) fem. هَأْنَ: (S, K:) also, sing. masc. and fem.
هَأْ; dual. masc. هَاآ, fem. هَائِيَا; pl. masc. هَاؤُوا,
fem. هَاؤُنَّ. (TA.) ―
-b4-  [See a saying of 'Omar
cited voce رَمَآءٌ, in art. رمى.] ―
-b5-  When it is said
to thee هَآءَ Take, thou sayest مَا أَهَآءُ What shall I
take? syn. مَا آخُذُ; and مَا أُهَآءُ, in the pass.
form, What shall I receive, or be given? syn.
مَا أُعْطَى. (S.) [Also, in the TA, it seems to
be said that أَهَآءَ signifies أَعْطَى He gave, or
made to take: but this is uncertain; as the
former verb is there written اهاءَ, and the latter
is without the syll. points]. ―
-b6-  هَآءَ is also syn.
with لبَّيْكَ At thy service! &c.. (K, TA.)
-A2-
لَا هَآءَ اللّٰهِ ذَا, or, more chastely, لَا هَا اللّٰهِ ذَا, or the
former is a barbarism; originally لَا وَاللّٰهِ هٰذَا:
ها and ذا are separated, and the name of God is
introduced between them; (K;) and the meaning is No, by God, (I did not) this! (S, art. ها,
q. v.) or No, by God, this (is what I swear
by)! (K.)
هَوْءٌ Mind; purpose; aspiration; desire; ambition. (S, K, TA.) Ex. بَعِيذُ الهَوْءِ A person
of far-reaching aspiration, or ambition. (S,
TA.) ―

مُهْوَأَنٌّ (S, K) and ↓ مَهْوَئِنٌّ (K) A wide desert,
or wide tract of the kind called صَحْرَآء. (S. K.)
―
-b2-  Custom: syn. عَادَةٌ. (K.) ―
-b3-  A part of the
night. (K.) ―
-b4-  The mention of مهوأنّ in this
art., by J, says IB, and F after him, is wrong;
for its measure is مفوعّل; the و being an augmentative letter. [But if so, F has himself done
wrong, in mentioning it, not only here, but also
in art. هون, (where, if the و be augmentative, it
is equally inappropriate,) as though it were a
quasi-quadriliteral-radical word, of the measure
مفعاُلّ.] ISd gives it as formed by transposition
from the root هنأ, and explains it as signifying a
wide place. (TA.)
مُهْوَئِنٌّ: see مُهْوَأَنٌّ.
