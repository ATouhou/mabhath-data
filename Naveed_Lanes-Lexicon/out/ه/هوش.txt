some saying ↓ تَهَاوِشَ; and some, تَهَاوُشٍ; and
some, نَهَاوِشَ, with ن, which is explained in the
K as signifying مَظَالِم: the relation given in the
S is that which is commonly known by the
lexicologists; but all are correct, excepting that
تَهَاوِش, with ت, and with a kesreh to the و, is
disapproved by some of the lexicologists: (TA:)
this last word is a contraction of تَهَاوِيشُ, pl. of
↓ تَهْوَِاشٌ, of the measure تَفْعَالٌ from الهَوْشُ, (K,
TA,) meaning “ the collecting ”; and “ mixing,”
“ confusing,” or “ confounding ”: (TA:) or from
هُشْتُ مَالًا حَرَامًا. (Sgh, TA.) A poet says,
تَأْكُلُ مَاجَمَعْتَ مِنْ تَهْوَاشِ
[Thou eatest what thou hast collected of things
unlawfully acquired]. (Sgh, TA.)
