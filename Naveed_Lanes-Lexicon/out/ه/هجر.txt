-b4-
[الهِجْرَةٌ, peculiarly, The emigration, or flight, (for
it was really a flight,) of Mohammad, from Mekkeh
to Yethrib, which latter was afterwards called
El-Medeeneh. Hence, تَأْرِيخُ الهِجْرَةِ The era of
the Hijreh, or Flight. The epoch of this era is
not the date of the Flight itself, as some have
imagined, (for this took place on an uncertain
day, most probably the first or second, of the
third lunar month of the Arabian year,) but is
the first day of the Arabian year in which the
Flight happened: and as I believe that all
European writers who have attempted to fix it,
prior to M. Caussin de Perceval, have erred
respecting it, the true date, as shown by him,
(see his “ Essai sur l'Histoire des Arabes,” &c.,
in the places referred to in the index to that
work,) I think it important here to mention.
The first year of the Flight was the two hundred
and eleventh year of a period during which the
Arabs made use of a defective luni-solar reckoning, making every third year to consist of thirteen lunar months; the others consisting of
twelve such months. This mode of reckoning
was abolished by Mohammad in the twelfth
month of the tenth year of the Flight, at the
time of the pilgrimage; whence it appears that
the first year of the Flight commenced, most
probably, on Monday, the nineteenth of April,
A. D. 622; or perhaps on the eighteenth; for
the actual appearance of the new moon properly
marked its commencement, and, as the new
moon happened about sunset on the sixteenth, it
may perhaps have been seen on the eve of the
eighteenth. According to M. Caussin de Perceval, the first ten years of the Flight commenced at the following periods.
1st.[Mon.]Apr. 19, 622
2nd.[Sat.]May 7, 623
3rd.[Th.]Apr. 26, 624
4th.[Mon.]Apr. 15, 625
5th.[Sat.]May. 3, 626
6th.[Th.]Apr. 23, 627
7th.[Tu.]Apr. 12, 628
8th.[Mon.]May. 1, 629
9th.[Fri.]Apr. 20, 630
10th.[Tu.]Apr. 9, 631
Thus it appears that the first and fourth and
seventh years were of thirteen lunar months
each; and the seventh was the last year that was
thus augmented: therefore, with the eighth
year commenced the reckoning by common lunar
years; and from this point we may use the
tables which have often been published for finding the periods of commencement of years of the
Flight. We must not, however, rely upon the
exact accuracy of these tables: for the commencement of the month was generally determined by actual observation of the new moon;
not by calculation; and we often find that a
year was commenced, according as the place
of observation was low or high, or to the east or
west of the place to which the calculation is
adapted, or according as the sky was obscure or
clear, a day later or earlier than that which is
indicated in the tables; and in some cases, even
two days later. The twelfth day of the third
month of the first year of the Flight, the day of
Mohammad's arrival at Kubà, was Monday:
therefore the first day of the year was most probably the nineteenth of April, as two months
of thirty days each, or twenty-nine days each,
seldom occur together. But the tenth day of
the first month of the sixty-first year, the day on
which El-Hoseyn was slain at Kerbelà, was
Friday: therefore the first day of that year, at
that place, must have been Wednesday, the third
of October, A. D. 680; not the first of October, as
in most of the published tables above mentioned.
(For the principal divisions of the Arabian year
when the luni-solar reckoning was instituted, see
زَمَنٌ)]. الهِجْرَتَانِ means [The two emigrations, or

of abode in which they were reared, for the sake
of God, and attached themselves to an abode in
which they had neither family nor property,
