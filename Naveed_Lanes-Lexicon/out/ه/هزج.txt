هزج1
هَزِجَ, aor.
هَزَجَ, (S, K,) inf. n. هَزَجٌ; (L;) He
sang in a certain manner, with trilling, or quavering; as also ↓ تهزّج; (S, K;) and ↓ هزّج: (K:)
or ↓ تهزّج signifies he reiterated, or made to reciprocate, the graceful modulations of his voice:
or prolonged his voice, without elevating it: (Aboo-Is-hák, L:) or هَزَجٌ does not at all signify trilling,
or quavering; and therefore IAar has applied
هَزِجٌ as an epithet to a dog that barks much.
(L.) ―
-b2-  He read, or recited, with a prolonging
and trilling of the voice, making the sounds to
follow closely, one upon another; as also ↓ تهزّج.

[
هَزَجٌ (tropical:)  The twanging of a bow, on the archer's
loosing the string after drawing it; and of a lutestring: in the TA, i. q. رَنّةٌ: pl. أَهْزَاجٌ and pl. pl.
أَهَازِيجُ: or perhaps this latter is a pl. of which
the sing. is ↓ أُهْزُوجَةٌ, like as أَرَاجِيزُ is pl. of أُرْجُوزَةٌ:
and the twanging of a bow-string or lute-string
may be likened to an ode or a song of the metre
termed الهَزَج, which is perhaps, judging from
analogy, the proper signification of اهزوجة.]
لِلْعُودِ وَالقَوْسِ أَهَازِيجُ (tropical:)  [To the lute and the bow

غَيْرَ إِنْذَارِهَا عَلَيْهِ الحَمِيرَا
بِأَهَازِيجَ مِنْ أَغَانِيِّهَا الجُشِ
وَإِتْبَاعِهَا النَّحِيبَ الزَّفِيرَا
[Neither its owner nor the people imputed a fault
to any of its properties, except its warning the
(wild) asses of his presence by the twangings of
its harsh singings, and its causing a groaning
sound to follow the loud, or prolonged, wailing].

verse; (S, K;) consisting of four feet, each of
