the latter is a simple subst., (Msb,) It (a man's
blood, S, A, Msb, K, or another thing, K) went
for nothing; [meaning, in the case of blood,
unretaliated, and uncompensated by a mulet; as

(A, Msb, K;) as also ↓ اهدرهُ; (S, A, Msb, K;)

to be taken, or shed. (S, TA.) Thus these two
verbs are trans. as well as intrans. (Msb.) It

هُدِرَتْ عَيْنُهُ [Whoso looketh into a house without

[Thou hast made me (meaning my offence) to
pass unnoticed, or host taken no account of
me, by annulling in respect of me the prescribed
castigation]. (K, art. بهرج.) And El-'Ajjáj

worthless people have made good fortune to become
of no account. (TA.)

(Kr, K,) and ↓ هُدَرَةٌ; (S, K;) which last is also
applied to a woman: (K, TA: [in the former of
which it seems to be implied that هَدَرَةٌ and
↓ هِدَرَةٌ are also applied, each, to a man and to a
woman; but it appears from what is said in the
TA that this is not the case:]) pl. هَدَرَةٌ and هُدَرَةٌ
and هِدَرَةٌ; the first of which is the most agreeable
with analogy, like كَفَرَةٌ, pl. of كَافِرٌ; the second
being of a measure exclusively belonging to words
which are unsound [in the last radical letter], as
in the instances of غُزَاةٌ and قُضَاةٌ, [originally غُزَوَةٌ
and قُضَيَةٌ, pls. of غَازٍ and قَاضٍ,] unless, indeed, it
be a quasi-pl. n.; and some disapprove it, finding
fault with IAar who relates it: the third, moreover, is not a pl. of a form, [regularly] belonging
to a sing. of the measure فَاعِلٌ, whether sound or
unsound: (ISd, TA:) [or, accord. to Sb, it is a
quasi-pl. n.:] or it is pl. of ↓ هِدْرٌ. (TA,) which
signifies a heavy man, (K, TA,) in whom is no
good; analogous with قِرَدَةٌ, pl. of قِرْدٌ. (TA:)
and ↓ هَدَرٌ [a quasi-pl. n. of هَادِرٌ, like as خَدَمٌ is
of خَادِمٌ,] signifies low, ignoble, or mean, people,

and هَدَّارٌ. ―
-b2-  [Hence the saying,] فُلَانٌ فُحْلٌ هَادِرٌ
(tropical:)  [app. Such a one is a vigorous orator of sonorous

كَالْمُهَدِّرِ فِى العُنَّةِ [Like the brayer in the
enclosure of wood, or canes, or trees]: a proverb:

which is followed by nothing, (S, A, *) or who
