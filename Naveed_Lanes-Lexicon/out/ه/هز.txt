aor.
هَزُ3َ, (A, Msb,) inf. n. هَزٌّ, (S, A, Msb,) [He

means of بِ, like أَخَذَ and تَعَلَّقَ: it is trans. in

thou towards thee the trunk of the palm-tree],
i. e. حَرِّكِى: but ISd says, that the verb is here
made trans. by means of ب because it is used in
the sense of جُرِّى: and MF says, that, properly,
it is not trans. by means of ب. (TA.) You
