هنهَنٌ
and هَنٌّ
A thing: and a penis: and the
vulva of a woman: (KL:) or the former is
pl. [or coll. gen. n.] of ↓ هَنَةٌ, which signifies a
small, or little, thing: (MA:) or this last signifies a thing, (KL,) as does هَنٌ: (K, KL:)
[but the former meaning I have found to be very
common, and I think it the more approvable.
↓ هَنَةٌ may be rendered something, somewhat:]
it denotes anything. (TA.)
هَنَةٌ
: see هَنٌ.
