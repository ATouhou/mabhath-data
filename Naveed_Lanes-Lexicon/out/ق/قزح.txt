appellation applied to The rainbow] in the sky,
(S,) i. e. certain streaks of an arched form
appearing in the sky in the days of the [season
called] رَبِيع, after rain, red and yellow and green,
(TA,) is imperfectly decl. [accord. to general
usage], (S,) [that is to say,] it is a compound of
two words whereof the latter is inseparable from
the former, so that one may not say تَأَمَّلْ قُزَحَ
فَمَا أَبْيَنَ قَوْسَهُ [Consider thou Kuzah, for how
plain is his bow!], (TA,) and the latter word is
said to be the name of a certain devil, as such,
imperfectly decl., (TA, Msb,) assigned to the
same class as زُحَل, which, as Mbr says, is imperfectly decl. as being a proper name and deviating
from its original form: (TA:) it is said in a
trad., Say not ye قَوْسُ قُزَحَ, for قُزَحُ is the name
of a devil, but say قَوْسُ اللّٰهِ: (Msb, TA:) or قُزَحُ
is the name of a certain angel who is charged
with the management of the clouds: or the name
of a certain king of the 'Ajam [i. e. Persians or
foreigners]: (K: [but SM remarks upon this
last saying as being very strange, deemed improbable by his sheykh (MF), and not found by
himself in any book except the K:]) or قُزَحُ is
the name of a mountain in El-Muzdelifeh, and
the word قَوْس was prefixed to it because this was
the first place over which the قوس thus called
appeared in the Time of Ignorance: (TA:) or
قُزَح thus used is from قُزْحَةٌ, (Msb, K, TA,) of
which قُزَحٌ is pl., (Msb,) and which signifies a
streak of yellow and of red and of green, (Msb,
K, TA,) which are the colours that are in the
[said] قوس; (TA;) and if so, it is perfectly decl.
[i. e. one says قَوْسُ قُزَحٍ]: (Msb:) or it is from
قَزَحَ signifying it was, or became, high, or
elevated: (K, TA:) Dmr strangely asserts that
قوس قزح is a mistake, and that it is correctly
قَوْسُ قَزَعٍ, from قَزَعٌ signifying “ clouds. ”

seeds called قِزْح;] two epithets applied to food:
(A:) accord. to the K, the latter is an imitative

meaning: as is said in the L, the former is from
المِلْحُ; and the latter, from القِزْح. (TA.)

تَقَازِيحُ (a pl. that has no sing., TA): see

which it is forbidden, in a trad., to perform
prayer, (TA,) or the performing of prayer
towards which is said in a trad. to be disapproved, is said to be A tree of the sort abovementioned: so says Az: (Mgh:) or, as some

dogs and the beasts of prey have emitted their urine
may be meant thereby. (Mgh, TA.)
