قَرُبَ, aor.
قَرُبَ, inf. n. قُرْبٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb *)
and قُرْبَةٌ and قَرَابَةٌ and قُرْبَى (Mgh, Msb) and
مَقْرَبَةٌ, (Mgh,) [to which may be added some
other syns. mentioned below with قُرْبٌ and قَرَابَةٌ,]
It, and he, was, or became, near; (S, Mgh, O;)
syn. دَنَا; (S, O;) contr. of بَعُدَ: (Mgh:) or
قُرْبٌ is in place, and قُرْبَةٌ is in station, or grade,
or rank, and قَرَابَةٌ and قُرْبَى are in الرَّحِم [meaning relationship, or relationship by the female
side]; (Mgh, Msb, TA;) or, accord. to the T,
قَرَابَةٌ is in النَّسَب [app. relationship in a general
sense], and قُرْبَى is in الرَّحِم [app. as meaning
relationship by the female side]: (TA:) You say,
قَرُبَ مِنْهُ, (A, MA, Msb, K,) and إِلَيْهِ; (A;) and
قَرِبَهُ, (S, MA, O, K,) aor.
قَرَبَ; (S, K;) inf. n.
(of the former verb, Msb) قُرْبٌ, (Msb, K,) or
قُرْبٌ and قُرْبَةٌ &c. as above, (Msb,) or قُرْبٌ and
مَقْرَبَةٌ and مَقْرُبَةٌ; (MA;) and (of the latter verb,
S, MA, O) قِرْبَانٌ (S, MA, O, K) and قُرْبَانٌ;
(K;) he (a man, S, O) was, or became, near to
it; (S, A, MA, O, K;) syn. دَنَا: (S, A, O, K:)
or the former verb means thus; but when one
says لَا تَقْرَبْ كَذَا with fet-h to the ر, the meaning
is, occupy not thyself with doing such a thing: (MF,
TA, &c.:) or قَرِبْتُ الأَمْرَ, aor.
قَرَبَ, and قَرَبْتُهُ, aor.
قَرُبَ,
i. e., like تَعِبَ and like قَتَلَ, inf. n. قِرْبَانٌ,
signifies I did the thing, or affair; or I was, or
became, near, or I approached, to it, or to doing
it [or to doing something with it or to it]: an ex.
of the former meaning is the saying [in the Kur
xvii. 34], لَا تَقْرَبُوا الزِّنَا [Commit not ye fornication, or adultery; or, accord. to some, this is
an ex. of the latter meaning]; and hence one
says, قَرِبْتُ المَرْأَةَ, inf. n. قِرْبَانٌ, a metonymical
phrase, meaning I compressed the woman: and
an ex. of the latter meaning is the saying, لَا
تَقْرَبُوا الحِمَى i. e. لَا تَدْنُوا مِنْهُ [meaning
Approach not ye to doing, or to entering upon,
the thing, or place, that is prohibited, or interdicted]. (Msb.) And the Arabs say, of a
man, when a thing has disquieted, or disturbed,
and grieved, him, أَخَذَهُ مَا قَرُبَ وَمَا بَعُدَ, as though
meaning (assumed tropical:)  He became, or has become, disquieted
by reason of near and remote circumstances of
his case: (O:) or recent and old griefs took hold
upon him. (Mgh in art. قدم. [See art. بعد.])
دَنَا مِنِّى وَقَرُبَ is expl. by Zj as meaning He drew
near to me and drew nearer. (T in art. دلو: see
5 in that art.) [And several other verbs belonging to this art. are syn., or nearly so, with قَرُبَ
or with قَرِبَ in senses expl. above. Thus ↓ اقرب
is syn. with قَرُبَ in the first of the senses expl.
above, like as أَدْنَى is with دَنَا, for its inf. n.]
الإِقْرَابُ signifies الدُّبُوُّ. (TA.) ↓ اقترب, also, is
syn. with قَرُبَ in the first of the senses expl.
above; (MA;) [i. e.] it is syn. with دَنَا: (Msb:)
or it is syn. with ↓ تقارب, (S, O, K, TA,) signifying he, or it, drew near; (TA;) thus ↓ وَاقْتَرَبَ
الوَعْدُ [in the Kur xxi. 97] signifies تقارب [meaning And the fulfilment of the promise shall draw
near]: (S, O, TA:) and you say, اقترب مِنِّى
[meaning He drew near to me]: (A:) it is also
said that is has a more particular signification
than قَرُبَ; for it denotes intensiveness in القُرْب;
thus says Ibn-'Arafeh; probably meaning that
it denotes labour and difficulty in the accomplishment of the act. (MF, TA.) ↓ تقرّب [likewise] is syn. with [قَرُبَ, i. e.] دَنَا, in the phrase
تقرّب مِنْهُ: (O: [see قَرُبَ مِنْهُ:]) or it signifies
he drew near, or approached, by little and little,
(تَدَنَّى,) to a thing. (TA.) And الشَّىْءَ ↓ قارب,
(ISd, TA,) or الأَمْرَ, (Msb,) [like قَرِبَهُ in many
instances,] signifies He was, or became, near, or
he approached, to the thing, or affair, or to doing
it. (ISd, Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  قَرُبَ, aor.
قَرُبَ, inf. n. قُرْبٌ
signifies also (assumed tropical:)  He formed an opinion that was
near to certainty. (MF.) ―
-b3-  In the phrase قَرَبَتِ

near to setting], like كَرَبَت, the ق is asserted by
Yaakoob to be a substitute for ك. (TA.)
-A2-
قَرَبَ, aor.
قَرُبَ; inf. in. قِرَابَةٌ, He (a man) journeyed

accord. to Lth, you say, قَرَبُوا, aor.
قَرُبَ, inf. n. قَرَبٌ
[q. v.], meaning They, after pasturing their
camels in the tract between them and the wateringplace, and journeying on during a part of the

of the K الإِبِلَ and in others الإِبِلُ], aor.
قَرُبَ, inf. n.
قِرَابَةٌ; thus in the K; but accord. to Th, قَرَبَتِ
الإِبِلُ, aor.
قَرُبَ, inf. n. قَرَبٌ; (TA;) i. e. The camels
journeyed by night in order to arrive at the water
on the morrow: (K, * TA:) and [a man says, of

And قَرَبْتُ المَآءَ, aor.
قَرُبَ, inf. n. قَرَبٌ, so in the Fs

night in order to reach it on the following morning].
(TA.) [Or] you say, قَرَبُوا المَآءَ, meaning They
sought, or sought to attain, the water. (A.) ―
-b3-
And [hence] one says, فُلَانٌ يَقْرُبُ حَاجَتُهُ, meaning
(assumed tropical:)  Such a one seeks, or seeks to attain, the object of
his want; from the seeking, or seeking to attain,
the water: and hence the saying, in a trad.,
وَإِنْ نَقْرُبُ بِذٰلِكَ إِلَّا أَنْ نَحْمَدَ اللّٰهَ (assumed tropical:)  We not seeking
thereby [aught] save our praising God: thus
expl. by El-Khattábee. (Az, TA.) [Hence,
also,] one says قَدْ قَرَبَ أَمْرًا لَا أَدْرِى مَا هُوَ (tropical:)  [He
has sought to accomplish an affair, I know not
what it is]: (A, O: *) and فُلَانٌ يَقْرُبُ أَمْرًا لَا

affair that will not be easy to him]. (A.) فُلَانٌ
يَقْرُبُ أَمْرًا means (assumed tropical:)  Such a one seeks, desires, or
aims at, [the accomplishment of] an affair,
when he does a deed, or says a saying, with that
object. (T, O, TA.)
-A3-  قَرَبَ السَّيْفَ, (S, O,)
inf. n. قَرْبٌ; (K;) and ↓ اقربهُ, (O,) inf. n.
إِقْرَابٌ; (K;) He put the sword into the قِرَاب
[q. v.]: (S, O, K:) or the former, (accord. to
the K,) or ↓ the latter, (accord. to the S and TA,)
he made for the sword a قِرَاب: (S, K, TA:) or
↓ the latter has both of these significations: (O:)
or the former verb is said of a sword or of a
knife in the former sense; and in like manner
↓ the latter verb in the latter sense: or the former
phrase signifies he made for the sword a قِرَاب;
and ↓ the latter phrase, he put the sword into its
قِرَاب: and one says, قِرَابًا ↓ قرّب and ↓ اقربهُ,
meaning he made a قِرَاب. (TA.)
-A4-  قَرْبٌ [as an
inf. n. of which the verb is قَرَبَ] also signifies
The feeding a guest with the أَقْرَاب (O, K, TA)
meaning flanks [of an animal or of animals, pl.
of قُرْبٌ or قُرُبٌ]. (TA.)
-A5-  And قَرِبَ, (O, K,)
with kesr to the ر, (O,) like فَرِح, (K,) [aor.
قَرَبَ,
inf. n. app. قَرَبٌ,] He (a man, TA) had a
complaint (O, K) of his قُرْب or قُرُب, (K,) [i. e.]
of his flank; (O;) as also ↓ قرّب, (O, * K, [in the
former this verb is only indicated by the mention
of its inf. n.,]) inf. n. تَقْرِيبٌ. (O, K.)
2
قرّبهُ, inf. n. تَقْرِيبٌ, He made, or caused, to
be, or become, near, caused to approach, or
brought, or drew, near, him, or it. (S, O, Msb. *)
[Hence the phrase قَرَّبَ اللّٰهُ دَارَكَ, which see in
what follows.] ―
-b2-  [And hence, He made him to
be a near associate; he made him an object of, or
took him into, favour: and (agreeably with an
explanation of the pass. in the Ham p. 184) he
made him, or rendered him, an object of honour.]
One says, قَرَّبَهُ مِنْهُ meaning He (a king, or a
governor, or prince, [or any other person who
was either a superioror an equal,]) made him to
be to him a قُرْبَان, i. e. [a near associate, or] a
consessor, or a particular, or special, associate or

-b3-  قَرَّبَهُ إِلَيْهِمْ,
in the Kur li. 27, means He presented it, or
offered it, to them: (Jel:) or he placed it, or put
it, before them. (Bd.) And one says also, قرّب

adversary before the Sultán]. (Mgh in art. رفع.)
And ↓ قرّب لِلّٰهِ قَرْبَانًا [He offered, or presented, to

-b4-  حَيَّا وَقَرَّبَ, (A, O,) inf. n.
تَقْرِيبٌ, (K,) signifies (tropical:)  He said, حَيَّاكَ اللّٰهُ وَقَرَّبَ
دَارَكَ [May God preserve thee alive, or prolong
thy life, and make thine abode to be near]: (A, O,
K:) one says thus of a host to a visitor. (TA.)
―
-b5-  And التَّقْرِيبُ signifies also The denoting nearness. (Mughnee and K * voce أَوْ, and Kull pp.
82 and 83 and 124.) Thus what is termed
تَصْغِيرُ التَّقْرِيبِ [The diminutive denoting nearness]
is such as occurs in the saying, دَارِى قُبَيْلَ المَسْجِدِ
[“ My house is a little before the mosque ”].
(Kull p. 124.) ―
-b6-  And The advancing an argument in such a manner as renders the desired conclusion a necessary consequence. (MF.) ―

inf. n. تَقْرِيبٌ, (S, A, O,) meaning he raised his
fore legs together and put them down together
(S, O, K *) in running: (S, O:) or he ran [as
though] pelting the ground [with his hoofs]: (AZ,
TA:) and it is also said of other animals than
the horse: but not of the camel: (MF:) [one
sort of] التقريب is [a rate] less than الحُضْرُ; (S,
A, O;) and more than الخَبَبُ: (El-Ámidee,
MF:) there are two sorts of تقريب, called أَعْلَى
[which is a gallop] and أَدْنَى [which is a canter]:
(S, O:) the former is termed الثَّعْلَبِيَّةُ; and the
latter, الإِرْخَآءُ. (TA.)

يَمْتَلِئَ (S, O) or قارب الاِمْتِلَآءَ (K) [It was, or
became, near to being full]: قارب [thus used] is
the verb from قَرْبَانُ [q. v.], and قَرُبَ is not used
in its stead. (Sb, TA.) And one says also,
قارب مِلْأَهُ [It was, or became, nearly equal, or it
nearly amounted, to what would fill it]. (Msb.),
And قارب قَدْرَهُ [It was, or became, nearly equal,
or equivalent, to its quantity, or amount; or it
was, or became, nearly equivalent to it]. (K,
TA.) [And hence the term أَفْعَالُ المُقَارَبَةِ The
verbs of appropinquation; as كَادَ &c.] ―
-b3-  قارب
الخَطْوَ He made the stepping to be contracted;
syn. دَانَاهُ; (AZ, K, TA;) [i. e. he made short
steps: made his steps to be near together;] said
of a horse. (TA.) And قارب كَلَامَهُ [He made
the several portions of his speech, i. e. he made his
words, to be near together; so that it means he
uttered his speech rapidly]. (K in art. وط; &c.) And
قارب بين الكَلِمَةِ وَالكَلِمَةِ فِى التَّسْبِيحِ [He made the words to follow one another nearly, or to be

K, TA.) ―
-b6-  And قارب فِى الأَمْرِ He pursued the
right, or just, or middle, course, neither exceeding
it nor falling short of it, in the affair. (O, * K, *
TA.) ―
-b7-  And قَارَبْتُهُ فِى البَيْعِ [app. meaning, in
like manner, I pursued a middle course with him
in selling, or buying, with respect to the price
demanded or offered, neither exceeding what was
just nor falling short of it], (S, O,) inf. n.

أَقْرَبَ see 1, second quarter. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] أَقْرَبَت,
(S, A, O, K,) said of the pregnant, (A, TA,) or
of a woman, and of a mare, and of a ewe or
goat, (S, O, TA,) and also of an ass, (Lth, TA,)
but [app.] not [properly] of a camel, (Lth, S, *
O, * TA,) [though it is sometimes said of a
camel, as in the S and O voce غَمُوس, and in the
O and K in art. ك,] She was, or became, near
to bringing forth. (Lth, S, A, O, K.) ―
-b3-  And
اقرب said of a colt, and of a young camel, (K,
TA,) &c., (TA,) He was, or became, near to the
age of shedding his central incisors; (K, TA;)

(TA.) ―
-b4-  And He nearly filled a vessel. (S, O,
K.) ―
-b5-  لَأُقْرِبَنَّكُمْ صَلَاةَ رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ occurs in a trad.
of Aboo-Hureyreh, meaning I will indeed perform to you the like of, or what will be nearly
the same as, the praying of the Apostle of God.
(TA.) ―
-b6-  اقرب الإِبِلَ He made the camels to
journey by night in order to arrive at the water

They, after pasturing them in the tract between
them and the watering-place, and journeying on
during a part of the time until there remained
between them and the water a night, or an evening,
hastened their camels. (Lth, TA.) ―
-b7-  And اقرب
القَوْمُ The people, or party, became persons whose
camels were performing a journey such as is
termed قَرَبٌ: the part. n. is [said to be] ↓ قارب,
not مُقْربٌ: (As, S, O:) the former of these is
said by A'Obeyd to be anomalous: (S, O:)
[but see قَرَبَ, which is expl. as having almost
exactly the same meaning as that which is in
this instance assigned to اقرب. And it is also
mentioned in the TA, app. on the authority of
AA, that the same phrase and the same anomalous part. n. are used when the people's camels
are مُتَقَارِبَة (which means few, or near together):
but I think that this word is a mistake of a
copyist, for قَوَارِبُ: see قَارِبٌ.]
-A2-  See also 1, last
quarter, in six places.

تَقَرَّبَ see 1, near the middle of the paragraph. ―
-b2-
[Hence] one says to his companion, urging him,
تَقَرَّبْ, meaning (tropical:)  Advance thou, or come forward: (A, TA:) or تَقَرَّبْ يا رَجُلُ, meaning
hasten, O man. (As, O, L, K, TA.) Only the
imperative mood in this sense is said to be used.
(MF, TA.) ―
-b3-  And [hence, also,] تقرّب signifies
He rendered himself near, or allied himself, [drew
near, or ingratiated himself,] by affection and
friendship. (TA, voce تَنَسَّبَ. [In this sense it
is trans. by means of مِنْ.]) And He applied
himself with gentleness, or courtesy, to obtain
access, or nearness, to a man, by means of some
act performed for that purpose, or by right.
(TA. [In this sense it is trans. by means of
إِلَى.]) And one says, تقرّب مِنَ اللّٰهِ [He drew
near unto God] by prayer or the like, and
righteous actions: and تقرّب اللّٰهُ مِنْهُ [God drew
near unto him] by beneficence towards him.
(TA.) And تقرِّب بِهِ إِلَى اللّٰهِ, (S, A, O, Msb,
K, *) inf. n. تَقَرُّبٌ and تِقِرَّابٌ, (O, K,) the latter
[of a rare form] like تِحِمَّالٌ and تِكِلَّامٌ and تِمِلَّاقٌ,
(O,) He sought thereby nearness, to bring himself
near, to draw near, or to approach, unto God;
or to advance himself in the favour of God: (S,
K, * TA:) and فَعَلَهُ تَقَرُّبًا إِلَيْهِ [He did it by way
of seeking nearness, &c., to Him]. (A.)
-A2-  تقرّب
also signifies He (a man, O) put his hand upon
his قُرْب (O, K, TA) i. e. his flank, (O, TA,) in
walking; or, as some say, hastening, or going
quickly. (TA.)
6
تقاربوا They were, or became, or drew,
near, one to another: (S, * A, * Msb:) you say
تقاربوا and ↓ اقتربوا [both app. signifying the
same, like تخاصموا and اختصموا, and تخالطوا and
اختلطوا, and تشاركوا and اشتركوا, &c.]. (A.)
―
-b2-  See also 1, second quarter. ―
-b3-  تقاربت إِبِلُهُ
means (tropical:)  His camels became few, [because drawing near together,] (A, O, K, TA,) and (as is
also said of other things, TA) declined, or
became reduced to a bad state. (O, * K, * TA.)
―
-b4-  And [for the like reason, because of its becoming dense,] تقارب is said of seed-produce, or
standing corn or the like, meaning (assumed tropical:)  It became
nearly ripe. (O, K, TA.) ―
-b5-  And hence [accord.
to some], تَقَارَبَ الزَّمَانُ (assumed tropical:)  [When the time

استقربهُ [contr. of استبعدهُ]. One says, هُوَ
يَسْتَقْرِبُ البَعِيدَ [He reckons near that which is
remote]. (A, Msb.)
قُرْبٌ [mentioned in the first sentence of this
art. as an inf. n.] is the contr. of بُعْدٌ: (S, O:)
[used as a simple subst., it signifies Nearness,
and] it is said to be [properly, or primarily,] in
respect of place; [i. e. vicinity;] as distinguished
from قُرْبَةٌ &c. (Msb, TA.) You say, إِنَّ قُرْبَكَ
زَيْدًا [Verily Zeyd is in thy vicinity; i. e., near
thee in respect of place]; but not إِنَّ بُعْدَكَ زَيْدًا;
because قُرْب is more capable of being used as an
adv. n. of place than بُعْد: in like manner they
said also ↓ هُوَ قُرَابَتَكَ, meaning [He is in thy
vicinity; i. e.,] near thee in respect of place.
(Sb, TA. [See also قَرِيبٌ.]) [And بِالقُرْبِ مِنْهُ
is a phrase of frequent occurrence, meaning In
the vicinity of, or near in respect of place to,
him, or it.] And one says, تَنَاوَلَهُ مِنْ قُرْبٍ and
↓ مِنْ قَرِيبٍ [He took it, or took it with his hand,
from a near place or spot]. (A, Msb.) And
رَأَيْتُهُ مِنْ قُرْبٍ [and ↓ مِنْ قَرِيبٍ I saw him, or it,
from a near place or spot, or from within a
short distance]. (S in art. ام; &c.) ―
-b2-  It is also
syn. with ↓ قَرَابٌ [signifying Nearness in respect
of time] as used in the saying اِفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ بِقَرَابٍ
[i. e. Do thou that soon; like as one says, عَنْ
↓ قَرِيبٍ]: (K, TA:) accord. to the K, the word
قراب in this case is like سَحَاب: but it is said in
a prov., أَكْيَسُ ↓ الفِرَارُ بِقِرَابٍ, thus in the S, or,
as some relate it, ↓ بِقُرَابٍ; and IB says, J has
cited this prov. [next] after the قِرَاب of the
sword, but should have said that القِرَابُ is also
syn. with القُرْبُ, and should then have adduced
the prov. as an ex. meaning The fleeing soon in
eagerness of desire for safety [is more, or most,
shrewd]: (TA:) [this rendering, however, requires consideration; for, accord. to Meyd, who
gives only the reading بِقِرَابٍ, the meaning of the
prov. is, that he who flees with the ↓ قِرَاب (by
which is meant the scabbard) when the sword
has passed away from his possession is more
shrewd than he who causes, or suffers, the قِرَاب
also to pass away from him: in Freytag's Arab
Prov. ii. 210, both of these explanations are
given; but قريب is there erroneously put for
قُرْب.] ―
-b3-  See also قَرَابَةٌ. ―
-b4-  It is also a pl. of
قَرِيبٌ [q. v.]. (TA in art. زلف.)
-A2-  قُرْبٌ also,
and ↓ قُرُبٌ, (S, O, K,) the former of which is the
original, (TA,) signify The خَاصِرَة [or flank]:
(O, K:) or [the part] from the شَاكِلَة [which is
syn., or nearly so, with خَاصِرَة,] to the مَرَاقّ [or
soft parts] of the belly: (S, O, K:) and likewise
from the رَفْغ [generally meaning groin] to the
armpit, on each side: (TA:) [properly used in
relation to a horse:] sometimes metaphorically
used in relation to a she-camel, and to an ass
[meaning a wild ass, and also to a man: see 5,
last sentence]: (TA:) pl. أَقْرَابٌ; (T, S, O, K;)
which is also used in the place of the dual. (T,
TA.)
قَرَبٌ [mentioned in the latter half of the first
paragraph of this art. as an inf. n.] is [said to be]
a subst., signifying A journey to water when it is
a night's journey distant: or, as As said, on the
authority of an Arab of the desert, (S, O,) a
journey by night in order to arrive at the water
on the morrow; (S, O, K;) and so ↓ قِرَابَةٌ [which
is also mentioned as an inf. n. in the latter half
of the first paragraph of this art.]; (K;) a
journey by night in order to arrive at the water
on the second following day being called طَلَقٌ:
(S, O:) and the seeking water by night: or,
when it is not more than a night's journey
distant: or the first day in which one journeys to
water when it is two days distant; the second day
being called طَلَقٌ: (K: [but the converse seems
to be the truth, being asserted by several of the
highest authorities, and agreeable with the
derivation of each of the two words: see طَلَقٌ:])
or the night after which, in the morning, one
arrives at the water: (TA:) and لَيْلَةُ القَرَبِ is
the night in which people with their camels
hasten to the water in a journey such as is termed
قَرَبٌ بَصْبَاصٌ; this latter term being applied to
signify a people's letting their camels pasture
while they are journeying towards water; and
when there remains an evening between them and
the water, hastening towards it: (S, O:) or, as
is said on the authority of As, لَيْلَةُ القَرَبِ is the
second night after the pastor has turned the
faces of his camels towards the water, and so left
them to pasture; this second night being the
night of hard driving; and the first night being
called لَيْلَةُ الطَّلَقِ: accord. to AA, [the journey
called] القَرَبُ is [the journey to water] during
three days, or more. (TA.) And [hence] القَرَبَ
is used to signify What is a night's journey
distant. (S in art. نوب, in explanation of a verse
cited in that art. [Or, accord. to IAar, قَرَب
there signifies near, so as to be visited repeatedly:
or, as AA says, at such a distance as to be
visited once in three days.]) [See also a saying
mentioned voce حَوْزٌ.] ―
-b2-  Also A well of which
the water is near [to the mouth]. (O, K.)
قُرُبٌ: see قُرْبٌ, last sentence.
قُرْبَةٌ an inf. n. of قَرُبَ [q. v.: and used as a
simple subst. signifying Nearness]; like قُرْبٌ: or
the former is in station, or grade, or rank.
(Mgh, Msb.) You say, طَلَبْتُ مِنْهُ القُرْبَةَ [I
sought of him nearness of station, &c.; or admission into favour]. (A.) ―
-b2-  See also قَرَابَةٌ. ―
-b3-
Also, (A, O, Msb,) and ↓ قُرُبَةٌ, (Msb,) A thing
[such as prayer, or any righteous deed or work,]
whereby one seeks nearness, to bring himself near,
to draw near, or to approach, unto God; or to
advance himself in the favour of God; (A, * O,
Msb;) as also ↓ قُرْبَانٌ: (S, O, Msb, K:) pl. of
the first and second قُرَبٌ and قُرْبَاتٌ and قُرُبَاتٌ
and قُرَبَاتٌ. (Msb.)
قِرْبَةٌ A kind of سِقَآء [or skin], (S, * O, * TA,)
used for water: (S, O:) or a وَطْب [or skin]
that is used for milk, and sometimes for water:
(ISd, K:) or such as is sewed on one side: (K:)
[the modern قِرْبَة, which is seldom, if ever, used
for anything but water, is (if I may judge from
my own observations and the accounts of others)
always made of the skin of a goat about one year
old or upwards: it consists of nearly the whole
skin; only the skin of the head, and a small
portion of that of each leg, being cut off: it has
a seam extending from the upper part of the
throat nearly to the belly, and sometimes a corresponding seam at the hinder part, but more
commonly only a patch of leather over the fundament and navel: over the seam, or over each
seam, is sewed a narrow strip of leather; and a
mouth of leather is added in the place of the head: it
is carried on the back, by means of a strap, or
cord, &c., one end of which is generally attached
to a cord connecting the two fore-legs; and the
other, to the right hind leg:] the pl. (of pauc.,
S, O) is قِرْبَاتٌ, and قِرَبَاتٌ, and قِرِبَاتٌ, and (of
mult., S, O) قِرَبٌ. (S, O, Msb, K.)
فِيهِ قَرَبَةٌ and ↓ قِرَابَةٌ are said of a vessel that is
nearly filled [meaning In it is a quantity that
nearly fills it]. (K, TA.) [See also قِرَابٌ.]
قُرُبَةٌ: see قُرْبَةٌ: ―
-b2-  and see also قَرَابَةٌ.
قُرْبَى [mentioned in the first sentence of this
art. as an inf. n.: and used as a simple subst.]:
see قَرَابَةٌ, in five places: and see also قَرِيبٌ,
latter half.
قَرْبَانُ A vessel nearly full: fem. قُرْبَى: (S, O,
K:) and pl. قِرَابٌ: (S, O:) you say قَدَحٌ قَرْبَانُ
مَآءً i. e. [A drinking vessel] nearly full of water:
and the ق in قربان is [said to be] sometimes
changed into ك: (TA:) so accord. to Yaakoob;
but ISd denies this. (TA in art. كرب.)
-A2-  See
also the paragraph here following.
قُرْبَانٌ: see قُرْبَةٌ: [it may often be rendered An
offering, or oblation: and hence it sometimes
means a sacrifice, as in the Kur iii. 179:] pl.
قَرَابِينُ. (Msb.) قُرْبَانُهُمْ دِمَآؤُهُمْ [Their offering
to God is their blood, lit. bloods,] occurs in a
trad. as cited from the Book of the Law revealed
to Moses, and as referring to the Arabs; meaning, they seek to bring themselves near unto
God by shedding their blood in fighting in the
cause of religion; whereas the قربان of preceding
peoples consisted in the slaughtering of oxen or
cows, and sheep or goats, and camels. (TA.)
And it is said in another trad., الصَّلَاةُ قُرْبَانُ كُلِّ
تَقِىٍّ [The divinely-appointed act of prayer is the
offering to God of every pious person]; meaning,
that whereby the pious seek to bring themselves
near unto God. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, (S, A, O, K,)
and ↓ قَرْبَانٌ, (K,) but this latter is by some disapproved, (TA,) [A near associate; or] a particular, or special, (A, K,) associate or companion
(A) or consessor; (K;) or a consessor; and a
particular, or special, associate or companion;
(S, ISd, O;) [or a familiar, or favourite;] of a
king, (S, ISd, A, O, K,) or of a governor, or
prince; (S, O;) [or of any person who is either
a superior or an equal;] so called because of his
nearness: (TA:) pl. قَرَابِينُ: (S, A, O, K:) and
one says also, فُلَانٌ مِنْ قُرْبَانِ الأَمِيرِ [Such a one
is of the near associates, &c., of the governor, or
prince]; (S, O;) [for] قُرْبَانٌ is [said to be
originally] an inf. n., and [therefore, as an
epithet,] the same as sing. and dual and pl.: (so
in a marginal note in one of my copies of the S:)
or, in a phrase of this kind, it is a pl. of ↓ قَرِيبٌ.
(A in art. بعد.)
قَرَابٌ: see قُرْبٌ, former half.
قُرَابٌ: see قَرِيبٌ, last quarter, in two places:
―
-b2-  and قُرْبٌ, near the middle: ―
-b3-  and قِرَابٌ,
former half: ―
-b4-  and قُرَابَةٌ.
قِرَابٌ [an inf. n. of 3. And hence قِرَابَ as an
adv. n. of time]. You say, أَتَيْتُهُ قِرَابَ العِشَآءِ I
came to him near nightfall: and قِرَابَ اللَّيْلِ near
night. (Lth, TA.) And 'Oweyf El-Kawáfee says,
describing she-camels, (so in the TA and in one
of my copies of the S,) or 'Oweyf El-Fezáree, (so
in the O,)
هُوَ ابْنُ مُنَضِّجَاتٍ كُنَّ قِدْمًا
يَزِدْنَ عَلَى العَدِيدِ قِرَابَ شَهْرٍ
(O, TA) i. e. He is the off spring of [one of the]
she-camels that went beyond the usual time of
bringing forth, that used formely to exceed the
computed [time] near a month: J give a
different reading of this verse, يَرِدْنَ عَلَى الغَدِيِر;
but the correct reading is that given above.
(IB, TA.) ―
-b2-  See also قُرْبٌ, near the middle. ―
-b3-
قِرَابُ الشَّىْءِ and ↓ قُرَابُهُ and ↓ قُرَابَتُهُ signify What
is nearly the equal in quantity, or amount, or
nearly the equivalent, of the thing. (K.) One
says, مَعَهُ أَلْفُ دِرْهَمٍ أَوْ قِرَابُهُ He has with him a
thousand dirhems, or nearly the equal thereof:
and مَعَهُ مِلْءُ قَدَحٍ مَآءً أَوْ قِرَابُهُ He has with him
a cupful of water, or nearly the equal thereof.
(Lth, TA.) And a poet says, (S,) namely, El-
'Ambar, (so in the O and TA,) or Es-Sinnabr,
(so in the Mz, 49th نوع,) Ibn-'Amr, Ibn-Temeem,
(O, TA, *)
إِلَّا تَجِئْ مَلْأَى يَجِئْ قِرَابُهَا
[If a full bucket (دَلْوٌ being understood, as is
indicated in the S and O and TA,) come not,
what will be nearly the equal thereof will come].
(S, O, TA.) One says also, لَوْ أَنَّ لِى قِرَابَ هٰذَا
ذَهَبًا i. e. [If there belonged to me] the quantity
nearly sufficient for the filling of this [of gold]:
and لَوْ جَآءَ بِقِرَابِ الأَرْضِ i. e. [If he brought] that
which would be nearly the equal in quantity of
the earth. (Msb.) And الرُّكْبَتَيْنِ ↓ المَآءُ قُرَابَةُ
[The water is such as is nearly the equal in height
of the two knees]. (A.) [See also قَرَبَةٌ.]
-A2-  Also
The غِمْد [i. e. scabbard, or sheath,] of a sword,
(K, TA,) or of a knife: (TA:) or the جَفْن
[i. e. case, or receptacle,] of the غِمْد; (K, TA;)
the جَفْن, which is a case, or receptacle, wherein
is the sword together with its scabbard (بِغِمْدِهِ)
and its suspensory belt or cord: (S, O, TA:) it
is like a جِرَاب of leather, into which the rider, or
rider upon a camel, puts his sword with its جَفْن
[here meaning scabbard], and his whip, and his
staff, or stick, and his utensils: (Az, TA:) or
like the جِرَاب, into which one puts his sword with
its scabbard (بِغِمْدِهِ), and his whip, and sometimes his travelling-provisions of dates &c.:
(IAth, TA:) the pl. of the قِرَاب of the sword is
قُرُبٌ [a pl. of mult.] (Msb, TA) and أَقْرِبَةٌ [a
pl. of pauc.], like خُمُرٌ and أَخْمِرَةٌ pls. of خِمَارٌ.
(Msb.) See also قُرْبٌ, latter half.
قَرِيبٌ Near in respect of place: (S, O, Msb,
K, * &c.:) in this sense used alike as sing. and
pl. (Kh, ISk, T, O, Msb, K *) and dual, (ISk,
TA,) and as masc. and fem., (AA, Kh, Fr, ISk,
T, S, O, Msb,) as is also بَعِيدٌ in the contr.
sense: (Kh, ISk, TA:) the Arabs say هُوَ قَرِيبٌ
مِنِّى, (ISk, O, * TA,) and هُمَا قَرِيبٌ مِنِّى, and هُمْ
قَرِيبٌ مِنِّى, (ISk, TA,) and هِىَ قَرِيبٌ مِنِّى, &c.,
meaning فِى مَكَانٍ قَرِيبٍ [in a place near, to me,
or little removed from me:] (ISk, O, TA:) or
when you say هِنْدٌ قَرِيبٌ مِنْكَ, it is as though you
said هِنْدٌ مَوْضِعُهَا قَرِيبٌ مِنْكَ [Hind, her place is
near to thee:] (AA, Msb:) hence, [in the Kur
vii. 54,] إِنَّ رَحْمَةَ اللّٰهِ قَرِيبٌ مِنَ المُحْسِنِينَ
[Verily the mercy of God is near unto the welldoers]: (AA, ISk, O, Msb:) but it is allowable
to say قَرِيبَةٌ, as also بَعِيدَةٌ: (ISk, O, Msb, TA:)
or (accord. to Zj, TA) قريب is here without ة
because رحمة is not really [but only conventionally] of the fem. gender: (S, O, TA:) [but this
reason is not satisfactory, because it does not
apply to other cases mentioned above:] and it is
also said that it is without ة because it is assimilated to an epithet of the measure فَعُولٌ, which
does not receive the fem. affix ة. (TA.) [Hence
the phrase مِنْ قَرِيبٍ:] see قُرْبٌ, former half, in
two places. And [hence also] you say, إِنَّ قَرِيبًا
مِنْكَ زَيْدًا [Verily Zeyd is in a place near to
thee]; like as you say, إِنَّ قُرْبَكَ زَيْدًا. (Sb, TA.)
―
-b2-  [Also Near in respect of time, whether future,
as in the Kur xlii. 16, &c.; or past, as in the
Kur lix. 15. And hence قَرِيبًا meaning Shortly
after and before. And Nearly, as when one
says, أَقَمْتُ بِالمَوْضِعِ قَرِيبًا مِنْ سَنَةٍ I remained,
stayed, or abode, in the place nearly a year.
Hence also the phrase عَنْ قَرِيبٍ:] see قُرْبٌ, near
the middle. ―
-b3-  And Near as meaning related by
birth or by marriage: (S, O, Msb, K:) [and
generally used as an epithet in which the quality
of a subst. is predominant, meaning a relation,
or relative:] in this sense it receives the fem.
form, by universal consent; so that you say,
هٰذِهِ المَرْأَةُ قَرِيبَتِى [This woman is my relation]:
(Fr, S, O, Msb: *) and likewise the dual form;
so that you say, [هُمَا قَرِيبَانِ and] هُمَا قَرِيبَتَانِ
[They two are relations]: (AA, Msb:) [and it
has a pl., namely, أَقْرِبَآءُ;] you say, هُمْ أَقْرِبَائِى
and أَقَارِبِى (S, A, O, K) [and أَقْرَبِىَّ, this last
originally أَقْرَبُوىَ; the first signifying They are
my relations; and the second and third, properly, being pls. of ↓ أَقْرَبُ, They are my nearer, or
nearest, or very near, relations; though in the T
the second is said to be pl. of قَرِيبٌ; and in most
of the copies of the K, but not in all, (for in
some the first of these three words is omitted,
as it is also in the TA,) it is implied that
أَقْرِبَآءُ and أَقَارِبُ and أَقْرَبُونَ (which are mentioned
in the Msb without any distinction of meaning)
are all to be understood in the latter sense]: and
قُرْبٌ [also] is a pl. of قَرِيبٌ [app. in the sense
here assigned to it], like as غُرْبٌ is of غَرِيبٌ;
(TA in art. زلف;) and قَرْبَى is allowable as a pl.
of فَرِيبٌ: (T, TA:) the pl. of قَرِيبَةٌ is قَرَائِبُ.
(T, Msb, TA.) And like as you say, هُوَ قَرِيبِى
[meaning He is my relation], as too you say,
↓ هُوَ ذُو قَرَابَتِى (S, O, K) and مِنِّى ↓ ذُو قَرَابَةٍ and
منّى ↓ ذُو مَقْرُبَةٍ and مِنِّى ↓ ذُو قُرْبَى; (TA;) but
not ↓ هُوَ قَرَابَتِى; (K;) [for only] the vulgar say
this; as also هُمْ قَرَابَاتِى: (S, O:) or, accord. to
Z, ↓ هُوَ قَرَابَتِى is allowable, being accounted
for as a phrase in which the prefixed n. [ذُو] is
suppressed; and it has moreover been asserted
to be correct and chaste in verse and prose:
↓ قَرَابَةٌ also occurs in the trads. in the sense of
أَقَارِبُ: it is said in the Nh to be an inf. n. used
as an epithet, agreeably with general analogy:
and in the Tes-heel it is said to be a quasi-pl. n.
of قَرِيبٌ, like as صَحَابَةٌ is of صَاحِبٌ: (MF,
TA:) [accord. to Mtr,] ↓ قَرَابَةٌ is correctly applicable to one and to a pl. number, as being originally an inf. n.; so that one says, هُو قَرَابَتِى
and هُمْ قَرَابَتِى; though the chaste phrase is ذُو
قَرَابَتِى applied to one; and ذَوَا قَرَابَتِى, to two;
and ذَوُو قَرَابَتِى, to a pl. number. (Mgh.) ―
-b4-
And [it is also applied to relationship:] one says,
بَيْنَنَا نَسَبٌ قَرِيبٌ and ↓ قُرَابٌ [Between us is a near
relationship]. (A.) ―
-b5-  It signifies also Near, or
allied, by affection and friendship. (TA voce
تَنَسَّبَ.) [You say, فُلَانٌ قَرِيبٌ مِنَ النَّاسِ meaning Such a one is near, &c., or friendly and
affectionate, to people, or mankind.] See also
قُرْبَانٌ, last sentence. ―
-b6-  And one says, مَا هُوَ بِعَالِمٍ
عَالِمٍ ↓ وَلَا قُرَابِ and عَالِمٍ ↓ قُرَابَةِ meaning قَرِيبِ عَالِمٍ
[i. e. He is not learned nor near learned]. (TA.)
And مِنْ ذٰلِكَ ↓ مَا هُوَ بِشَبِيهِكَ وَلَا بِقُرَابَةٍ meaning
وَلَا بِقَرِيبٍ مِنْ ذٰلِكَ [i. e. He is not the like of thee
nor near that]; (S, O;) or مِنْكَ ↓ وَلَا بِقُرَابَةٍ
meaning بقَرِيبٍ [i. e., nor near the like of thee].
(K.) ―

-A2-  Also, (O, K,
TA,) but in some of the lexicons written قِرِّيبٌ,
(TA,) Salted fish, while yet in its recent, moist,
state. (O, K, TA.)
قَرَابَةٌ, (S, O, K,) which is originally an inf. n.,
(S,) [i. e., of قَرُبَ, as is also, app., every one of
its syns. here following,] and ↓ قُرْبَى and ↓ قُرْبَةٌ
and ↓ قُرُبَةٌ (S, O, K) and ↓ قُرْبٌ (S, O) and
↓ مَقْرُبَةٌ and ↓ مَقْرَبَةٌ (S, O, K) ↓ مَقْرِبَةٌ, (K,) all
of them, (S, O, K,) or the first and ↓ قُرْبَى, (Msb,)
signify Relationship, or relationship by the female
side; (S, O, * Msb, K, * TA;) or the first has
the former of these significations and ↓ قُرْبَى has
the latter of them: (T, TA:) [in the S, القَرَابَةُ is
expl. signifying القُرْبَى فِى الرَّحِمِ; and in the
Mgh and Msb, it and ↓ القُرْبَى are expl. as being
فِى الرَّحِمِ; but in the T, as cited in the TA, the
former is expl. as being فِى النَّسَبِ, and ↓ القُرْبَى
as being فِى الرَّحِمِ: see the first sentence of this
art.:] you say, بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَهُ قَرَابَةٌ &c. [i. e. Between
me and him is a relationship, or a relationship by
the female side]. (S, O.) ―

places. ―
-b3-  قُرَابَةُ المُؤْمِنِ and ↓ قُرَابُهُ signify The
believer's فِرَاسَة [i. e. insight, or intuitive perception, &c.]; (Fr, O, K;) and his opinion, which
is near to knowledge and assurance: occurring in
a trad., in which it is said that one is to beware
thereof, because he looks with the light of God.
(Fr, O, TA. [See also فِرَاسَةٌ.])
قِرَابَةٌ: see قَرَبَةٌ:
-A2-  and see also قَرَبٌ.
جَاؤُوا قُرَابَى, (IDrd, O, K,) the latter word
similar to فُرَادَى, (IDrd, O,) They came near together. (IDrd, O, K.)
قُرَيْبَى [dim. of قُرْبَى]. دُونَ كُلِّ قُرَيْبَى قُرْبَى
[There is a relationship nearer than every
relationship small in degree] is a prov. applied to
him who asks of thee something wanted which
one more nearly related to thee than he has
asked of thee. (Meyd. [See another prov., app.

art. دنو.])
قَرَّابٌ A maker of [what are called] قرب [app.

(TA.)
قَرْنَبٌ: &c.: see art. قرنب.
قَارِبٌ [part. n. of قَرَبَ said of a man journeying
to water: and accord. to As and A'Obeyd, part.
n. of أَقْرَبَ used in a similar sense; as such

specifying any time: (TA:) or, accord. to Kh,

TA;) not applied to one doing so by day. (S,
O, TA.) And its pl. قَوَارِبُونَ signifies Persons
whose camels are performing a journey such as is
termed قَرَبٌ: (As, S, O:) see 4, latter half.
The epithet applied to camels in this case is
قَوَارِبُ; (S, O;) [of which see another explanation voce طَلَقٌ;] and this epithet is also
used in relation to birds. (IAar, TA.) مَا لِى
قَارِبٌ وَلَا هَارِبٌ occurs in a trad., meaning I have
not any that goes to water nor any that returns
from it. (L, TA. [See also هَارِبٌ.]) And
