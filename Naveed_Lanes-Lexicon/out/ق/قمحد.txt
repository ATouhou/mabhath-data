قمحدالقَمَحْدُوَةُ What is behind the head; (S, in art.
قحد; and Msb;) that is to say, (Msb,) the
[occiput or] hinder part of the back of the head;
(T, Msb, K;) i. e., the surface between the ذُؤَابَة
[here app. meaning the hair that surrounds the
round part of the head] and what is termed فَأْسُ
القَفَا [or the small protuberance above the back of
the neck]: (T:) also, the protuberance above the
back of the neck, (L, K,) between the ذُؤَابَة [see
above] and the back of the neck, sloping down
from the هَامَة [or middle, or crown, or top, of
the head]; it is the part of the head which
touches the ground when a man lies on his back:
(L:) also, the upper part of the back of the head:
(L, K:) or that part of the bone of the head
which projects over the back of the neck; the هامة
being above it; and the قَذَال, below it, next the
part of the back of the neck that is between the
ears: (AZ, L:) pl. قَمَاحِدُ (S, L, K, &c.) and
قَمَاحِيدُ and قَمَحْدُوَاتٌ. (L.) Accord. to J and
AHei, the م is an augmentative letter; but
others hold it to be a radical; and F says, that
J's mentioning this word in art. قحد requires
consideration. (TA.)
