قعث1
قَعَثْتُ لَهُ قَعْثَةً, (S, O, K, * TA, *) [accord. to
which last, ↓ قَعْثَةٌ is an inf. n., as also قَعْثٌ, but,
if an inf. n., it is app. an inf. n. un.,] aor.
قَعُثَ,
(accord. to the TK, [but I think it is more probably
قَعَثَ, agreeably with a general rule, like the
aor. of the same verb in the next sentence,])
means حَفَنْتُ لَهُ حَفُنَةٌ, (S, O,) i. e. I gave to him
a small quantity, (S, O, K, *) مِنَ الشَّىْءِ [of the
thing]. (TA.)
-A2-  قَعَثَ الشَّىْءَ, aor.
قَعَثَ, inf. n. قَعْثٌ,
He (a man) eradicated, or uprooted, the thing;
(IDrd, O, L;) and (O) so ↓ قعّثهُ, inf. n. تَقْعِيثٌ.
(O, K.)

قَعَّثَ see what immediately precedes.
4
اقعث فِى مَالِهِ He acted extravagantly in
respect of his property. (ISk, S, O, K. *) ―
-b2-
And اقعث لَهُ العَطِيَّةَ He made the gift to him
large; (S, O, K, TA;) and so ↓ اِقْتَعَثَهَا, and اقعثهُ
[i. e. اقعثهُ العَطِيَّةَ]. (TA. See the verse cited
voce مُقْعَثٌ; and the remark of As respecting it.)
7
انقعث It was, or became, pulled out, or up,
(As, S, O, TA,) from the foundation, or utterly;
(As, S, TA;) it was, or became, eradicated, or
uprooted. (K.) One says, ضَرَبَهُ فَانْقَعَثَ He
struck it, and it became pulled out, or up, (As, S,
O, TA,) from the foundation, or utterly. (As,
S, TA.) ―
-b2-  And It (a wall) fell down from its
foundation: like انقعف. (As, S, O.)
8
اقتعث He (a digger) took forth much earth
from a well. (O, K.) ―
-b2-  See also 4.
قَعَثٌ Muchness, or abundance. (TA. [See
قَعِيثٌ.])
قَعْثَةٌ: see the first sentence of this art.
قُعَاثٌ A certain disorder in the noses of sheep,
or goats: (O, K:) thus expl. by Aboo-Turáb.
(O.)
قَعِيثٌ, (O, K,) as expl. by As, (O,) Paltry,
or little in quantity; syn. هَيِّنٌ and يَسِيرٌ. (O, K.
[See also مُقْعَثٌ.]) ―
-b2-  And Abundant, or copious;
applied to rain: (S, O, K:) and to a benefit, or
benefaction, &c.: (TA:) and to a gift (سَيْب):
(O, TA:) and, (S, K, TA,) or as some say,
(O,) to a torrent (سَيْل), (S, O, K,) as meaning
thus, (S, O,) or as meaning great: (K:) whence,
in a verse of Ru-beh,
↓ مَا شَآءَ مِنْ أَبْوَابِ كَسْبٍ مِقْعَثِ
[What he will of the means of the attainment of
abundant gain]; مِقْعَثٌ being of the measure
مِفْعَلٌ from قَعِيثٌ as applied to rain &c. (O.
[The word كسب, of which the right reading is
certainly as above, is there imperfectly written,
more like كُسْب than كَسْب.])
مُقْعَثٌ [pass. part. n. of 4]. Ru-beh says,
أَقْعَثَنِى مِنْهُ بِسَيْبٍ مُقْعَثِ
لَيْسَ بِمَنْزُورٍ وَلَا بِرَيِّثِ
[He gave me liberally thereof, or from him, a
large gift, (lit., accord. to the explanation of the
verb, a gift made large,) not such as was small,
or not such as was obtained by importunity, nor
such as was slow in coming]: (S, * TA:) but As
says that Ru-beh has done ill in using the phrase
بسيب مقعث; for مُقْعَث, he says, means paltry,
or little in quantity; syn. هَيِّنٌ and يَسِيرٌ [like
قَعِيثٌ, which is said to have this meaning and
also the contr. thereof]. (TA. [Perhaps the right
reading in the verse cited above is ↓ مِقْعَث.]
مِقْعَثٌ: see قَعِيثٌ. [See also what here immediately precedes.]
