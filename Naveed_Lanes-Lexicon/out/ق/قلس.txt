تَقَلْسَى and تَقَلْنَسَ He attired himself
with, or wore, a قَلَنْسُوَة; (S, K;) as also ↓ تَقَلَّسَ.
(S, A.) [The last of these verbs is used by ElHemedhánee transitively, as meaning, He attired
himself with a cap of the kind called دَنِّيَّة as a
قلنسوة: (see De Sacy's Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed.,
T. iii., p. 90 of the Arabic text:) but perhaps
this usage is only post-classical.]
قَلْسٌ, (A, K, and so in a copy of the S,) or
↓ قَلَسٌ, (A, Mgh, Msb, TA, and so in a copy of
the S,) the former being the inf. n., (Mgh, Msb,)
and ↓ قَلَسَانٌ, (TA,) [but this last is more like an
inf. n.,] What comes forth, (Kh [accord. to the
S], or Lth, AZ [accord. to the TA], S, A, Msb,
K,) from the throat, (Kh or Lth, S, A, K,) or
from the belly, to the mouth, (AZ, Msb,) as much
as fills the mouth, or less, (Kh or Lth, S, A, Msb,
K,) of [undigested] food or drink, (AZ, Msb,)
peculiarly, with acidity, and that acid humour
itself, (Meyd, as cited by Golius,) whether the
person cast it forth or return it to his belly: (AZ,
Msb:) when it is repeated, (Kh, S, A, K,) or
overcomes, (Lth, TA,) it is termed قَىْءٌ: (Kh
or Lth, S, A, K:) or what comes forth, of vomit,
being as much as fills the mouth: (Mgh:) pl.
أَقْلَاسٌ. (TA.)

قَلْسَاةٌ: see قَلَنْسُوَةٌ.

قَلَنْسُوَةٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ قُلَنْسِيَةٌ (S, K) and
↓ قَلْسُوَةٌ and ↓ قَلْسَاةٌ (TA) A certain thing that is
worn upon the head, (K, TA,) well known; (TA;)
[a cap, generally high and pointed, but sometimes
close-fitting, which was worn by the Arabs, sometimes alone, and sometimes beneath the turban:
there was also one kind which was round, like a
melon: (see أُرْصُوصَةٌ:) and a cowl, or hood, of a
pointed form: see طُرْطُورٌ, and بُرْنُسٌ, and عَرَقِيَّةٌ:
'Abd-El-Lateef applies the term قَلَنْسُوَة نُحَاس to
the cap of copper which covered the head of the
obelisk standing on the site of Heliopolis,
now called El-Matareeyeh:] the kind worn by
the Companions [of the Prophet] was such as
fitted close to the head, [not pointed, or] not going
away into the air: (K in art. بطح:) pl. قَلَانِسُ
and قَلَاسٍ (S, Msb, K) and قَلَانِيسُ and قَلَاسِىٌّ
and قَلَنْسٍ, which last is [properly a coll. gen. n.
of which قَلَنْسُوَةٌ is the n. un., being] originally
قَلَنْسُوٌ, for there is no noun ending with an infirm
letter preceded by a dammeh, wherefore the و is
changed into ى, and the dammeh into a kesreh,
and then the word becomes like قَاضٍ [for قَاضِىٌ].
(S, K.) The dim. is ↓ قُلَيْنِسَةٌ and ↓ قُلَيْسِيَةٌ and
↓ قُلَيْنِيسَةٌ and ↓ قُلَيْسِيَّةٌ: (S, K:) but not قُلَيْنِيسِيَةٌ;
for the Arabs form no dim. of a word of five [or
more] letters so as to preserve all the letters,
unless the fourth be a letter of prolongation.
