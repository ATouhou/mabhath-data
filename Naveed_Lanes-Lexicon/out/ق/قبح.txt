قبح1
قَبُحَ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) aor.
قَبُحَ, (Msb, K,)
inf. n. ↓ قُبْحٌ, (Msb, K,) [or this, accord. to the S,
seems to be a simple subst.,] and قَبْحٌ (K) and
قَبَاحَةٌ (S, K) and قُبُوحَةٌ and قُبُوحٌ and قُبَاحٌ, (K,)
He, or it, (a form, and an action, L, and anything, T,) was, or became, bad, evil, abominable,
foul, unseemly, unsightly, ugly, or hideous; contr.
of حَسُنَ. (S, Msb, K, TA, &c.) One says of a
man, قَبُحَ وَشَقُحَ [app. using the latter v. as an
imitative sequent]: and جَآءَ بِالقَبَاحَةِ وَالشَّقَاحَةِ [He
did, or said, what was bad or evil &c.]. (K in
art. شقح.) And ↓ اُقْبُحْ إِنْ كُنْتَ قَابِحًا Be thou
bad or evil &c., if thou be desirous of becoming so:
and قَوْقَ مَا قَبُحَ ↓ مَا هُوَ بِقَابِحٍ He is not becoming
bad &c., or will not become bad &c., above the
degree in which he has become so: and in like
manner one says in similar cases. (Lh, L.)
-A2-
لَا تَقْبَحُوا الوَجْهَ, occurring in a trad., means Say
not ye that the face is قَبِيح [i. e. unseemly, unsightly, ugly, or hideous]; because God formed it:
or the meaning is, say not ye قَبَحَ اللّٰهُ وَجْهَ فُلَانٍ
[expl. in what follows]. (L.) ―
-b2-  And قَبَحَهُ اللّٰهُ,
(S, A, Msb, K, TA, &c., [in the CK قَبَّحَهُ,])
aor.
قَبَحَ, (Msb,) inf. n. قَبْحٌ and قُبُوحٌ, (AZ, L, TA,)
God removed him, or may God remove him, (S,
A, Msb, K, &c.,) far, (A, TA,) from good, or
prosperity, (S, Msb, K,) or from all that is good;
(L, TA;) [or from success, or the attainment of
that which he deserves or seeks; (see the pass. part.
n.;)] like as one does the dog and the pig: (AZ,
L, TA:) [or God drove him away, or may God
drive him away, like a dog: or God rendered him,
or may God render him, foul, unseemly, unsightly,
ugly, or hideous, in form: (see, again, the pass.
part. n.:)] and اللّٰهُ ↓ قَبَّحَهُ has a similar, but
intensive, signification. (Msb.) One says, قَبْحًا لَهُ
[an elliptical expression, a verb and its agent being
understood, i. e., with these supplied, (May God
decree) removal far from good, &c., to him; or
(cause) removal &c. (to cleave) to him; meaning
may removal &c. betide him]; (S;) and ↓ قُبْحًا
(S, A) also, (S,) with damm; (A;) [i. e. foulness,
unseemliness, unsightliness, ugliness, or hideousness;]
and لَهُ وَشُقْحًا ↓ قُبْحًا; (L, K, TA;) and قَبْحًا لَهُ
وَشَقْحًا; in which شقحا is [said to be] an imitative
sequent. (L, TA: but see art. شقح.) ―
-b3-  قَبَحْتُ
لَهُ وَجْهَهُ, [thus,] without teshdeed, means I said
to him, قَبَحَ اللّٰهُ وَجْهَكَ [i. e. May God remove
thee far from good, &c., for وَجْهَكَ is here put for
نَفْسَكَ, the phrase being] from القَبْحُ signifying
“ the removing far [from good, &c.]. ” (AA, L.
[See an ex. in a verse cited in art. سبح, conj. 2.])
-A3-  And قَبَحَ (IAar, L, K, TA, [accord. to the
CK قبّح, and so in one of two copies of the A,
but the former is the right, as is shown by the
form of the aor. in an ex. in the TA,]) He broke
a purulent pustule (in his face, L,) in order that
the matter might come forth: (L, K, TA:) or he
squeezed a purulent pustule to express its contents
before it was ripe: (A, TA:) and [in like manner] he broke an egg, (K,) or anything. (L.)
2
قبّحهُ He (i. e. God) rendered him, or it,
bad, evil, abominable, foul, unseemly, unsightly,
ugly, or hideous. (L.) ―
-b2-  See also the preceding
paragraph, near the middle. ―
-b3-  And He rejected,
or reprobated, what he said, as bad, evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly. (L.) ―
-b4-  And قبّح عَلَيْهِ فِعْلَهُ,
(S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَقْبِيحٌ, (S, K,) He showed,
or declared, his deed to be bad, evil, abominable,
foul, or unseemly: (K:) said when a deed is such
as is blamed. (Msb.)
3
قابحهُ, (A,) inf. n. مُقَابَحَةٌ, (K, TA,) with
which مُكَابَحَةٌ is syn., (TA,) He reviled, or vilified,
him, being reviled, or vilified, by him; or he vied,
or contended, with him in reviling, or vilifying
(A, K. *)
4
اقبح He did [or said] what was bad, evil,
abominable, foul, or unseemly. (S, A, K.)
-A2-
مَا أَقْبَحَ وَجْهَهُ is said in reviling a man [as meaning How foul, unseemly, unsightly, ugly, or hideous,
is his face!]. (Ham p. 138.)
10
استقبحهُ He regarded him, or it, as bad,
evil, abominable, foul, unseemly, unsightly, ugly,
or hideous; (TA;) contr. of استحسنهُ. (S, * K.)
قُبْحٌ [either an inf. n. or a simple subst.; much
used as a simple subst., and ↓ مَقَابِحُ, q. v., may be
an anomalous pl. thereof, like as مَحَاسِنُ is said
to be of its contr. حُسْنٌ]: see 1, first sentence;
and again, in two places, in the latter half.
القَبَاحُ: see the next following paragraph.
قَبِيحٌ Bad, evil, abominable, foul, unseemly,
unsightly, ugly, or hideous; contr. of حَسَنٌ; (S,
L, Msb, K, &c.;) applied to a form, and to an
action, (L,) and to anything: (T:) pl. قِبَاحٌ and
قَبَاحَى and قَبْحَى: fem. قَبِيحَةٌ; pl. قَبَائِحُ and
قِبَاحٌ. (K.) ―
-b2-  نَاقَةٌ قَبِيحَةٌ الشُّخْبِ A she-camel
having wide orifices to her teats. (A, K.) ―
-b3-
القَبِيحُ [is said to signify] The extremity of the
bone of the elbow; (S, TA;) so in the T; and the
إِبْرَة is another small bone, the head of which is
large, and the rest of it small, [the former, i. e.
the head.] compactly joined to the قَبِيح: (TA:)
or [it is more correctly expl. as] the extremity of
the bone of the upper half of the arm, next the
elbow; (K, TA;) the extremity next the shoulderjoint being called الحَسَنُ, because of the abundance of the flesh that is upon it: (TA:) or the
(??) part of the upper half of the arm; the
upper part being called الحَسَنُ: (Fr. TA:) or
the قَبِيحَانِ are the two slender ends that are at
the heads of the ذِرَاعَانِ [here meaning the two
bones of the fore arm; (TA:) or the قَبِيح is the
place of junction [of the bones] of the shank and
the thigh, (K, TA,) which are termed قَبِيحَانِ;
(TA;) and it is also called ↓ القَبَاحُ: (K, TA:)
accord. to A'Obeyd, كِسْرُ قَبِيحٍ, (L, TA,) which
is composed of two syn. words, one prefixed to
the other, governing it in the gen. case, (L,)
signifies the bone of the سَاعِد [here meaning the
upper half of the arm] from the part next the
middle to the elbow. (L, TA; and thus it is expl.
in the S and K in art. كسر.)
قُبَّاحٌ A bear (K, TA) that is extremely aged,
or old and weak. (TA.)
قَابِحٌ [as part, n. of قَبُحَ]: see 1, first quarter,

مَقْبُوحٌ, of which the pl. occurs in the Kur
[xxviii. 42]. (S, L, Msb,) Removed (S, Msb, K,
TA) far (TA) from good, or prosperity, (S, K,)
or from all that is good: (L, TA;) or from
success, or the attainment of that which he desires
or seeks; (Msb;) like as are the dog and the pig:
(AZ, L, TA:) or driven away like a dog: (ISd,
TA:) or rendered foul, unseemly, unsightly, ugly,
or hideous, in form. (I'Ab, TA.) [See also
مَشْقُوحٌ, in the first paragraph of art. شقح.]
مَقَابِحُ Bad, evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly,
qualities or dispositions [&c.]; contr. of [مَحَاسِنُ
and] مَمَادِحُ. (L. [See قُبْحٌ.])
