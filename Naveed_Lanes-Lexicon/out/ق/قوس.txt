قَوْسٌ [A bow;] a certain thing, well known,
(A, K,) with which one shoots: (M, TA:) of the
fem. gender: (IAmb, M, Msb:) or masc. and
fem.: (S, Msb:) or sometimes masc.: (A, K:)
pl. [of pauc.] أَقْوَاسٌ (IAmb, S, A, Msb, K) and
أَقْيَاسٌ, (TA, and so in some copies of the
K, in the place of the former,) the ى being
interchangeable with the و, (TA,) and [of
mult.] قِسِىٌّ, (S, A, Msb, K,) originally قُوُوسٌ,
(S, TA,) which is not used, (TA,) of the
neasure فُعُولٌ, (S, Msb,) first changed to قُسُوٌّ, of
he measure فُلُوعٌ, and then to قِسِىٌّ, of the
measure فِلِيعٌ, like عِصِىٌّ, (S,) and قُسِىٌّ, (Fr,
Sgh, K,) from the same original, (TA,) [like
عُصِىٌّ,] and قِيَاسٌ, (IAmb, S, A, Msb, K,) which
is more agreeable with analogy than قسىّ.
(TA.) The dim. is قُوَيْسٌ, (IAmb, M, Msb, K,)
without ة, contr. to rule, as the word is fem.,
(M, TA,) and قُوَيْسَةٌ, (IAmb, Msb, K,) sometimes: (IAmb, Msb:) or the former accord. to
those who make قوس to be masc., (S,) and the
latter accord. to those who make it to be fem.
(S, Msb.) It is prefixed to another word to
give it a special signification. Thus you say,
قَوْسُ نَبْلٍ An Arabian bow. And قَوْسُ نُشَّابٍ A
Persian bow. And قَوْسُ حُسْبَانٍ [A bow for
shooting a certain kind of short arrows]. And

خَيْرِ قُوَيْسٍ سَهْمًا; (S, L, K; except that in the L
and K, for قويس, we find قَوْسٍ;) (tropical:)  [He is of the
best of a little bow, as an arrow; i. e., he is one

قُوَيْسٍ سَهْمًا (A, K) (tropical:)  [He became the best of a

arrow of a little bow:] a proverb [See Arab.
Prov. i. 718] applied to him who has become
mighty after being of mean condition: (A:) or
to him who opposeth thee and then returns to
doing what thou likest. (A, K.) [Hence also
the phrase in the Kur, liii. 9,] فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ
And he was at the distance of two Arabian bows:
or two cubits [this is app. an explanation by one
who holds قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ to be for قَابَىَ قَوْسٍ:] (K:)

perhaps, قَيَّاسٌ. (TA.)
قُسَوِىٌّ is the rel. n. from قِسِىٌّ, [pl. of قَوْسٌ,]
