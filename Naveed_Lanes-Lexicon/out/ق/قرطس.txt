قَرْطَسٌ and قِرْطَسٌ: see قِرْطَاسٌ.
قِرْطَاسٌ Paper; syn. كَاغَدٌ: (K:) or such as is
made of the بَرْدِىّ [or papyrus], found in Egypt:
(TA:) [and particularly a roll, or scroll, thereof:
see also طُومَارٌ, and سُرْفَةٌ:] what one writes
upon: (S, Msb:) also written قُرْطَاسٌ; (S, Msb,
K;) but the former is the better known, (Msb),
or the former only is of established authority, for
El-Járabardee says the contrary of the latter;
(MF;) and قَرْطَاسٌ; (Lh, ISd, K;) but this is
not mentioned by most of the lexicographers;
(MF;) and ↓ قَرْطَسٌ signifies the same; (AZ, S,
Msb, K;) and so does ↓ قِرْطَسٌ. (K [app. on the
authority of El-Fárábee and Aboo-'Alyà; but the
names are imperfectly written in the TA.]) ―
