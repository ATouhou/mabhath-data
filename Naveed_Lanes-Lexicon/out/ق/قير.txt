Persian] كَارْوَانْ, (TA,) and signifying A caravan; a company, or an assemblage of persons,
travelling together; syn. قَافِلَةٌ: (K:) or the

IAth, and so in a copy of the S:) or of [such a
collection of soldiers as is called] a كَتِيسبَة: (ISk:)
and the companions and assistants of the devil.
(IAth.) It has the last of these significations in
a trad. of Mujáhid, in which it is said, يَغْدُو
الشَّيْطَانُ بِقَيْرَوَانِهِ إِلَى السُّوقِ فَلَا يَزَالُ يَهْتَزُّ العَرْشُ
مِمَّا يَعْلَمُ اللّٰهُ مَا لَا يَعْلَمُ [The devil goeth in the
morning with his companions and assistants to the
market-place, and the empyrean ceaseth not to
shake in consequence of the assertions that God
knoweth what He knoweth not]: meaning, that
the devil incites men to say “ God knoweth such
a thing,” of things whereof God knoweth the
contrary: [as for instance, “God knoweth that
such a commodity cost me (the seller) such a sum
of money: ”] يَعْلَمُ اللّٰهُ being a form of asseveration.
(IAth.) [قيروان is written قَيْرُوَانٌ in some copies
of the S and K. It is mentioned in this art., and in
art. قرو, in the K: in the S, only in the latter
art., and part of the above trad. is there cited.]
