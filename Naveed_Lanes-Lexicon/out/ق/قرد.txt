قِرْدٌ [The ape; the monkey; and the baboon;]
a certain animal, (TA,) well known: (L, K:)
fem. with ة: (S, L, Msb:) pl. [of pauc., of the
masc.,] أَقْرُدٌ, (L, Msb,) and أَقْرَادٌ, (L, K,) and
[of mult., of the same,] قُرُودٌ and قِرَدَةٌ, (S, L,
Msb, K,) and [quasi-pl. n.] قَرِدَةٌ; (K;) and pl.
of the fem., (S, L, Msb,) قِرَدٌ. (S, L, Msb, K.)
Hence the proverb أَزْنَى مِنْ قِرْدٍ [More incontinent
than an ape]; because the قِرْد is the most incontinent of animals: (K:) such is generally said to
be the meaning of this proverb: (TA:) or (accord.

meaning عَطَفَتْ, [She returned to spinning at last,
and left not in Nejd a piece of refuse of wool]:
(S, L:) in the K, عَثَرَتْ is put for عَكَرَتْ; and
both readings are mentioned by the relaters of
proverbs: [عثرت على الغزل app. signifies she
applied herself by chance to spinning:] the proverb is applied to him who neglects a needful
business when it is possible, and seeks to accomplish it when it is beyond his reach: (K:) its
origin is the fact, that a woman neglects spinning
while she finds that which she may spin, (of
cotton or flax &c., L,) until, when it is beyond
her reach, she seeks for refuse of wool among
sweepings and rubbish. (L, K.) ―

adopted from a dislike to [the concurrence of]
the two dáls: (S, L:) Sb says, that قَرَادِيدُ is a
pl. of قَرْدَدٌ; but as one also says قُرْدُودٌ, there is
no reason for this assertion: (L:) ISh says, that
↓ قُرْدُودَةٌ signifies elevated and rugged ground producing little herbage, and all of it gibbous: and
Sh, that it signifies an extended strip [of ground],
