قَرِضَ, (S, M, A, &c.,) inf. n. قَرْضٌ,
(S, M, Msb,) He cut it; (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb,
K;) namely a thing, (S, Msb,) or a garment, or
piece of cloth, (A, Mgh,) with the مِقْرَاض, (A,
Mgh, Msb,) and with the مِقْرَاضَانِ; (Msb;) and
in like manner, [or as signifying he cut it much,
or frequently, or repeatedly,] you say, ↓ قرّضهُ, (M,
TA,) inf. n. تَقْرِيضٌ: (TA:) this is the primary
signification. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) said of a
rat, or mouse, (A'Obeyd, S, A, Mgh, Msb,) aor.
and inf. n. as above, (S, * Msb, TA,) He [cut it
with his teeth; gnawed it; or] ate it; (Msb;)
namely a garment, or piece of cloth, (S, A, Mgh,

aor. as above, (A, TA,) and so the inf. n., (TA,)

-b3-  [Hence also,] قَرَضَ
رِبَاطَهُ, (S, M, A, K,) [lit.] He cut, or severed,
his bond, i. e. the bond of his heart; and consequently, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  he died; (IAar, M, K, TA;)
as also قَرَضَ alone, (S, [in which the former is
not explained] O, Msb, K,) and قَرِضَ: (IAar, O,
K:) or (assumed tropical:)  he was at the point of death. (K.)
And you say, جَآءَ وَقَدْ قَرَضَ رِبَاطَهُ (AZ, Az, S,
&c.) (assumed tropical:)  He came harassed, or distressed, or fatigued, and at the point of death: (AZ, Az:) or
(tropical:)  harassed, or distressed, by thirst, or by fatigue:
(A:) or (assumed tropical:)  in a state of intense thirst and hunger:
(M:) said of a man: (S:) mentioned in the S
in such a manner as [appears] to indicate that
the verb has here the first of the significations
mentioned in this art.; but this is not the case
[as is shown in the S itself in art. ربط]. (TA.)
See also 7.
-A2-  [Hence also,] قَرَضْتُ الوَادِى (assumed tropical:)  I
passed through, or across, the valley. (Msb.)
It is said in the Kur, [xviii. 16,] وَإِذَا غَرَبَتْ
تَقْرِضُهُمْ ذَاتَ الشِّمَالِ (assumed tropical:)  And when it [the sun] set,
to leave them behind on the left; to pass by and
beyond them, leaving them on its left: (S, K:)
so explained by AO, or by A'Obeyd: (so
accord. to different copies of the S,) to leave
them and pass by them on the left; not falling
upon them at all: (Jel:) or to turn aside,
or away, from them, on the left: (Msb:) or to
be over against them, on the left: from قَرَضْتُهُ,
meaning حَذَوْتُهُ, i. e. I was over against him, or
it; as also ↓ أَقْرَضْتُهُ. (JK.) And a man says to
his companion, Hast thou passed by such and
such a place? and the man asked says قَرَضْتُهُ ذَاتَ
اليَمِينِ لَيْلًا (assumed tropical:)  [I passed by it, leaving it behind, on
the right, by night]. (S.) The Arabs say,
قَرَضْتُهُ ذَاتَ اليَمِينِ, and ذَاتَ الشِّمَالِ, and قُبُلًا, and
دُبُرًا, (assumed tropical:)  I was over against him, or it, on the right,
and on the left, and before, and behind. (Fr.)
You say also, قَرَضَ المَكَانَ, (M, Msb, K,) aor.
and inf. n. as above, (M,) (assumed tropical:)  He turned aside, or
away, from the place. (M, Msb, K.) And

سَمِعَ, (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, passed away from a thing to

-A3-  Hence
also, (TA,) قَرَضَ الشِّعْرَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor. as
above, (S, Msb,) and so the inf. n., (S,) (tropical:)  He
said, spoke, uttered, or recited, poetry; or he
poetized, or versified; syn. قَالَ الشِّعْرَ: (A'Obeyd,
S, K:) or he composed poetry according to rule:
(Msb:) because poetry consists of cut feet: or
because it is called قَرِيض as being likened to the
cud: (A:) or because it is language cut out:
(Msb:) or as being likened to a garment; as
though the poet cut it and divided it into
portions; although MF denies that this phrase
is from قَرَضَ as signifying “ he cut: ” he has also
assigned to قَرْضُ الشِّعْرِ a signification which belongs
to تَقْرِيضٌ, q. v. (TA.)
-A4-  Hence also, قَرَضَهُ as
syn. with قَارَضَهُ, q. v. (TA.)
2
قَرَّضَ see 1, first signification.
-A2-  تَقْرِيضٌ also
signifies (assumed tropical:)  The art of poetry: (M, TA:) or
the criticism thereof; the picking out the faults
thereof; and the discriminating, by consideration,
of what is good thereof from what is bad, both
expressed and speculative. (TA.)
-A3-  Also, like
تَقْرِيظٌ; (assumed tropical:)  The act of praising: or dispraising:
(S, TA:) or it has both these contr. significations; (K, TA;) relating to good and to
evil; whereas تقريظ relates only to praise and
good. (TA.) You say, فُلَان يُقَرِّضُ صَاحِبَهُ
(assumed tropical:)  Such a one praises his companion: or dispraises
him. (S.)
3
قارضهُ, inf. n. مُقَارَضَةٌ and قِرَاضٌ, (M,) [He
lent to him, and received from him, a loan: or
it signifies, or signifies also,] i. q. أَقْرَضَهُ, q. v.
(L, TA.) ―
-b2-  قِرَاضٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and مُقَارَضَةٌ,
(S, A, K,) with the people of El-Hijáz, (TA,)
also signify i. q. مُضَارَبَةٌ; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;)
as though it were a contract for traversing the
land [for traffic], (K,) from القَرْضُ فِى السَّيْرِ, or,
as Z says, from القَرْضُ فِى الأَرْضِ, meaning “ the
traversing the land,” like as مضاربة is from
الضَّرْبُ فِى الأَرْضِ; (TA;) and the form of the
contract is what is shown by the following explanation. (K.) You say, قَارَضْتُهُ, (S, A, Mgh,)
or قَارَضْتُهُ مِنَ المَالِ, (Msb,) I gave to him
property (S, A, Mgh, K *) مُضَارَبَةً, (A, Mgh,)
[i. e.] that he might traffic with it, on the condition that the gain should be between us, and the
loss should fall upon the property. (S, K. [See
also ضَارَبَهُ.]) ―
-b3-  قارضهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. مُقَارَضَةٌ,
(TA,) also signifies (tropical:)  He requited him; he compensated him; (S, K;) and so ↓ قَرَضَهُ, (S, K,)
inf. n. قَرْضٌ. (TA.) Hence the saying of Abu-l-Wardà, (TA,) إِنْ قَارَضْتَ النَّاسَ قَارَضُوكَ وَإِنْ
تَرَكْتَهُمْ لَمْ يَتْرُكُوكَ وَإِنْ هَرَبْتَ مِنْهُمْ أَدْرَكُوكَ
(tropical:)  (A, * TA) [If thou requite men their evil deeds,
they will requite thee; and if thou leave them,
they will not leave thee; and if thou flee from
them, they will overtake thee]: meaning if thou
do evil to them, they will do the like thereof to
thee; and if thou leave them, thou wilt not be
safe from them, for they will not let thee alone;
and if thou revile them and injure them, they
will revile thee and injure thee: he said this intending thereby to censure them: and it is from
the signification of “ cutting. ” (TA.) [See also
قَرْضٌ, below.] You say also, فُلَانٌ يُقَارِضُ النَّاسَ,
inf. n. مُقَارَضَةٌ, (tropical:)  Such a one accords, or agrees,
with men. (A.) And قَارَضْتُهُ الزِّيَارَةَ (tropical:)  [I interchanged visiting with him]. (A.)
4
اقرضهُ He cut off for him a portion, to be
requited, or compensated, for it. (Sgh, K.)
[And hence,] He gave him, or granted him, a
قَرْض [or loan, or the like]; (S, M, A, * Mgh, *
K;) and ↓ قَارَضَهُ signifies the same as اقرضهُ. (L,
TA.) You say also, اقرضهُ المَالَ, (M, Msb,)
وَغَيْرَهُ, (M,) [He lent him the property, &c.;] he
gave him the property, &c., as a قَرْض; (M;) he
gave him the property, [&c.,] to demand its
return. (Msb.) It is said in the Kur, [lxxiii.
20,] وَأَقْرِضُوا اللّٰهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا [lit. And lend ye to
God a good loan; meaning (assumed tropical:)  give ye to God
good service for which to be requited]: (S, TA:)
it is not here said إِقْرَاضًا because the simple subst.
[as distinguished from the inf. n.] is what is
meant. (TA.) And again, in the same, [ii. 246,
and lvii. 11,] مَنْ ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللّٰهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا,
meaning, accord. to Aboo-Is-hák the Grammarian, (assumed tropical:)  [Who is he who will offer unto God] a
good action or gift, or anything for which a
requital may be sought? or, as Akh says, (assumed tropical:)  Who
will do a good action by following and obeying the
command of God? (TA.) The Arabs say,
قَدْ أَقْرَضْتَنِى قَرْضًا حَسَنًا (assumed tropical:)  Thou hast done to me a
good deed [which I am bound to requite]. (TA.)
And it is said in a trad., أَقْرِضٌ عِرْضَكَ لِيَوْمِ فَقْرِكَ
(assumed tropical:)  [Lend thou thine honour for the day of thy
poverty]; meaning, when a man defames thee, do
not thou requite him, but reserve his recompense
undiminished for thee, as a loan for the payment
of which he is responsible, that thou mayest
receive it from him in the day of thy need thereof: (TA:) [but see عِرْضٌ.] ―
-b2-  [And hence,]
أَقْرَضَنِى الشَّىْءَ He gave, or paid, to me the thing.
(M.)
-A2-  مَا عَلَيْهِ مَا يُقْرِضُ عَنْهُ العُيُونَ فَيَسْتُرُهُ
(assumed tropical:)  [There is not upon him what will turn aside, or
away, from him the eyes, and cover him]. (Ibn-
'Abbád, Sgh.)
-A3-  See alse 1, latter half.
6
تَقَاْرَضَ [تَقَارَضَا They lent and received loans, each
to and from the other.]
-A2-  [And hence,] هُمَا
يَتَقَارَضَانِ الخَيْرَ وَالشَّرَّ (assumed tropical:)  [They two interchanged
good and evil, each with the other]; (IKh, S, K;)
as also يتقارظان: (IKh:) [but see the latter in
its proper place.] And هُمَا يَتَقَارَضَانِ المَدْحَ,
(AZ,) or الثَّنَآءَ, (A, Msb,) or الثَّنَآءَ بَيْنَهُمْ, (TA,) [or
بَيْنَهُمَا, (in the M, هُمْ يَتَقَارَضُونَ الثَّنَآءَ بَيْنَهُمْ,)]
(tropical:)  They praise each other; (AZ, Msb;) as also
يتقارظان: (AZ:) or they requite, or compensate,
each other with praise. (TA.) And القِرْنَانِ
يَتَقَارَضَانِ النَّظَرَ (assumed tropical:)  The two opponents, or adversaries, look askance, with anger, each at the other:
(S, K:) and يَتَقَارَضُونَ نَظَرًا (assumed tropical:)  They look with
enmity and vehement hatred, one at another.
(TA.) And هُمْ يَتَقَارَضُونَ الزِّيَارَةَ (tropical:)  [They interchange visiting]. (A.) El-Kumeyt, says,
يَتَقَارَضُ الحَسَنَ الجَمِيلَ مِنَ التَّأَلُّفِ وَالتَّزَاوُرْ
meaning, Interchanging what is good and comely,
of sociable conduct and mutual visiting. (O.) ―
-b2-
El-Hasan El-Basree, being asked whether the
companions of the Apostle of God used to jest, or
joke, answered, (TA,) نَعَمْ وَيَتَقَارَضُونَ, (K, * TA,)
i. e. Yes, and they used to recite poetry [one to
another]: (TA:) from قَرِيضٌ as signifying
“ poetry. ” (K.)
7
انقرضوا (assumed tropical:)  They passed away, or perished, [as
though cut off,] (S, K,) all of them, (K,) not one
of them remaining; (S;) as also ↓ قُرِضُوا [perhaps
a mistake for قَرِضُوا: see 1]. (TA.)
8
اقترض He received what is termed قَرْض [a
loan, or the like], (S, Msb, K,) i. q. اِسْتَلَفَ; (A;)
مِنْهُ from him. (S, A, K.)
-A2-  اقترض عِرْضَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He
defamed him, or spoke evil of him, behind his
back or in his absence, or otherwise; syn. اِغْتَابَهُ:
(K:) as though he cut off [somewhat] from his
honour. (TA.)
10
استقرض مِنْ فُلَانٍ, (S, Msb, *) or استقرضهُ,
(A, Mgh,) He sought, or demanded, of such a one
what is termed قَرْض [a loan, or the like]. (S,
A, * Mgh, * Msb.) ―
-b2-  [And hence,] اِسْتَقْرَضْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ
I sought, or demanded, of him the gift, or payment [in advance], of the thing. (M.)
قَرْضٌ (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ قِرْضٌ;
(Ks, S, M, K;) or, accord. to Th, the former is
an inf. n., and the latter a simple subst., but this
[says ISd] does not please me; (M;) or the
former is an inf. n. used as a subst.; (Mgh;) or
a subst. from أَقْرَضْتُهُ المَالَ; (Msb;) [A loan:
and the like:] a piece of property which a man
cuts off from his [other] articles of property, and
which, itself, he receives back; [in rendering the
explanation in the Mgh, for the words فَيُعْطِيه عينًا
in my copy of that work; I read فَيُقْضَاهُ عَيْنًا,
which makes this agreeable with explanations
given in other works;] but what is due to the
one from the other as a debt is not so called;
(Mgh, [see دَيْنٌ;]) what one gives, (S, Msb, K,)
to another, (Msb,) of property, (S, Msb,) to
receive it back, (S, K,) or to demand it back:
(Msb:) or a thing that one gives to be requited for
it, or to receive it back: (TA in art. فرض:) or a
thing of which men demand the payment [or
restitution], one of another: (M, L:) or a thing
which a man gives, or (assumed tropical:)  does, to be requited for
it: (Aboo-Is-hák the Grammarian, and TA:)
pl. قُرُوضٌ. (M, Msb.) You say, عَلَيْهِ قَرْضٌ
[He owes a loan], and قُرُوضٌ [loans]. (A.) ―
-b2-
Hence, (S, TA,) (tropical:)  What one does, in order to be
requited it, of good, and of evil. (S, K, TA.)
See three exs. above, under 4. The Arabs also
say, قَدْ أَحْسَنْتَ قَرْضِى, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Thou hast done
to me a good deed [which I am bound to requite].
(TA.) And لَكَ عِنْدِى قَرْضٌ حَسَنٌ, and قَرْضٌ سَيِّئٌ
(assumed tropical:)  I owe thee a good deed, and an evil deed.
(Aboo-Is-hák the Grammarian, and TA.)
قِرْضٌ: see قَرْضٌ.
قَرِيضٌ The cud: (Lth, A:) or what the camel
returns [to his mouth, to be chewed again, or to
his stomach,] of his cud; (S, K;) as also ↓ مَقْرُوضٌ:
(S:) or it is applied to the cud (جِرَّة) of the camel,
and signifies chewed: or, accord. to Kr, this
is فَرِيضٌ, with ف. (M.) And hence, accord. to
some, the saying حَالَ الجَرِيضُ دُونَ القَرِيضِ [explained in art. جرض]: but accord. to others, the
last word in this saying has the signification next
but one following. (S.)
-A2-  The sound, or voice,
of a man in dying. (Er-Riyáshee, in TA, art.
جرض.)
-A3-  (tropical:)  Poetry: (S, M, A, Msb, K:) so
called for one or another of the reasons mentioned
under 1, last sentence but one; (A, Msb, TA;)
of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure
مَفْعُولٌ: (Msb:) El-Aghlab El-'Ijlee distinguishes
between it and رَجَز. (IB.)
قُرَاضَةٌ [Cuttings; clippings; and the like;]
what falls by the action termed القَرْض; (S, A, *
Mgh, * K;) as, for instance, of gold, (S, TA,) and
of silver; and of a garment, or piece of cloth,
which a tailor cuts with his shears; (TA;)
and of this last, and of bread, (JK, TA,) &c.,
(TA,) by the gnawing (قَرْض) of a rat, or mouse:
(JK, A, Mgh, TA:) pl. قُرَاضَاتٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] أَخَذَ الأَمْرَ بِقُرَاضَتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He took the thing,
or affair, in its fresh state. (M, L.) ―
-b3-  [Hence
also,] قُرَاضَةُ المَالِ (assumed tropical:)  [The refuse, or] what is bad,
vile, paltry, or of no account, of property. (TA.)
―
-b4-  قُرَاضَةٌ also relates to an evil action, and an
evil saying, which one man directs against
another. (TA.) [What is meant by this is not
clear to me.]
قَرَّاضَةٌ A certain creeping insect (دُوَيْبَّة) that eats
wool. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [And hence, app.,] (assumed tropical:)  A man who
defames others, or speaks evil of them, behind their
backs, or otherwise; syn. مُغْتَابٌ لِلنَّاسِ. (TA.)
اِبْنُ مِقْرَضٍ, (S, M, A, Msb,) [in one copy of
the S, ابن مُقْرِضٍ, and in another, ابن مُقَرَّضٍ,]
like مِقْوَد, (Msb,) [A species of weasel;] a certain
small beast (دُوَيْبَّة), (S, M, Msb,) called in
Persian دَلَهٌ, (S, Msb,) or دَلَّهٌ, (as in one copy of
the S,) whence the arabicized word دَلَقٌ, (Msb,)
which kills pigeons, (S, M, A,) seizing upon their
throats, and it is a species of rat; (A;) the longbacked quadruped that kills pigeons: (Lth, O,
Msb:) this last explanation is given by the author
of the Bári', after saying that it is a small beast
(دويبّة), like the cat, which is in houses, and, when
angry, gnaws clothes: (Msb:) accord. to some,
i. q. النِّمْسُ [q. v.]: (Msb:) pl. بَنَاتُ مِقْرَضٍ. (A,
(Msb.)
مُقَرِّضَاتُ الأَسَاقِى A [kind of] small creeping
thing (دُوَيْبَّة), which makes holes in, and cuts,
skins used for water or milk. (M.)
مِقْرَاضٌ is the sing. of مَقَارِيضُ; (S, Msb, K;)
and a pair thereof is called مِقْرَاضَانِ: (Msb, K:)
the مِقْرَاض is [A single blade of a pair of shears
or scissors;] a thing with which one [shears, or
clips, or] cuts; and when you speak of the two
together, you do not say مِقْرَاضٌ, as the vulgar
say, but مِقْرَاضَانِ; (Msb;) which last is syn.
with جَلَمَانِ [a pair of shears]; a word, accord.
to the lexicologists having no sing.; but Sb
mentions مِقْرَاضٌ, thus using the sing. form: (M:)
or مِقْرَاضٌ and مِقْرَاضَانِ signify the same; [a pair
of shears;] like جلَمٌ and جَلَمَانِ, and قَلَمٌ and
قَلَمَانِ: (Msb in art. جلم:) or مِقْرَاضٌ signifies
جَلَمٌ صَغِيرٌ [a small pair of shears; i. e. a pair of
scissors]: (JK:) 'Adee Ibn-Zeyd uses the expression شَفْرَتَا مِقْرَاضٍ [the two blades of a pair of
shears or scissors] in a poem; (IB;) and other
poets use the sing., مقراض: (TA:) and مِفْرَاصٌ,
with ف and ص, signifies the same. (IB.) Hence
the saying, لِسَانُ فُلَانِ مِقْرَاضُ الأَعْرَاضِ (tropical:)  [The
tongue of such a one is the detractor of reputations].
(TA.)
مَقْرُوضٌ pass. part. n. of قَرَضَهُ. ―
-b2-  See قَرِيضٌ.
