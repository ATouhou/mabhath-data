―
-b2-  [And It was, or became, too short. And
قَصُرَ عَنْهُ It was, or became, too short for him, or

the first has this signification; (ISk, S, Msb;)
and [in like manner] عَنْهُ ↓ قصّر, (M, K,) inf. n.
تَقْصِيرٌ, (TA,) he left or relinquished it, or abstained from it, being unable to do or accomplish
it: (M, K:) but عَنْهُ ↓ اقصر, he desisted or abstained from it, being able to do or accomplish it:
(ISk, S, M, Msb:) such, at least, is generally
the case, though both sometimes occur in one
and the same sense, that which اقصر عنه generally
bears: (TA:) and فِى الأَمْرِ ↓ قصّر [he fell, or stopped,
or came, short in the affair: it signifies nearly
the same as اقصر عنه, i. e., he fell short of
accomplishing the affair; he fell short of doing
what was requisite, or due, or what he ought to
have done, (عَمَّا كَانَ يَنْبَغِى, or the like, being
understood,) in, or with respect to, the affair: a

بِنَا النَّفَقَةُ The money for expenses [fell short of
what we required;] did not enable us to attain
our object; (Msb;) meaning, that they were unable to pay the expenses: (Mgh:) and بِهِ ↓ قَصَّرَ
أَمَلُهُ [his hope fell short of what he required]:
'Antarah says,
فَالْيَوْمَ قَصَّرَ عَنْ تِلْقَائِكَ الأَمَلُ
[but to-day, hope hath fallen short of extending to
the meeting with thee]. (TA.) [And hence,

thing], said to him who has sought, or desired,

↓ اقصر; and ↓ قصّر and ↓ تقاصر; (M, K;) He refrained, abstained, or desisted, from the thing, or

aor.
قَصُرَ, inf. n. قُصُورٌ, (M,) The pain, and anger,
ceased from me; quitted me; (M, K;) as also

the مَسَآء [i. e. afternoon, or evening]: (S:) or it
means has almost drawn near to night. (TA.)

-b2-  Hence, (S,) قَصَرْنَا and
↓ أَقْصَرْنَا We entered upon the عَشِىّ [i. e. afternoon,
or evening]; (M, K;) the former signifies أَمْسَيْنَا;
and the latter, دَخَلْنَا فِى قَصْرِ العَشِىِّ, like as you
say أَمْسَيْنَا from المَسَآءُ: (S:) or the former, we

shackles of the camel; syn. صَيَّقُتُهُ; (Msb;) and
I contracted his shackles; syn. قَارَبْتُ. (M.)

He made the gift scanty, or mean: or, accord.
to the TK, قصّر فِى العَطِيَّةِ, which properly
signifies he fell short of what he ought to have
done with respect to the gift: but, though each of
these phrases is doubtless correct, the former expression I hold to be that which is indicated
when it is said that] التَّقْصِيرُ signifies إِخْسَاسُ
العَطِيَّةِ. (M, K.)

held confined in, or kept within, his house or tent:

and so] defended the house by walls. (TA.) And
قَصَرَ الجَارِيَةَ بِالْحِجَابِ He [confined and so] kept

قَصَرَ بِهِمُ اللَّيْلُ, (TA,) or ↓ قَصَّرَ, (L,) The night
withheld them; namely a company of riders upon
camels on other beasts. (L, TA.) You also say
قَصَرَ الرَّجُلَ عَنِ الأَمْرِ [and قَصَرَ بِهِ and به ↓ قصّر]
He withheld the man from the thing, or affair,
that he desired to do. (TA.) [See an ex. in a
verse cited voce طَلَّاع.] And قَصَرْتُ نَفَسِى عَنْ
شَىْءٍ I withheld, or restrained, myself from a
thing: (JK, TA: *) and I restrained myself from
inordinate desire of a thing. (TA.) Lebeed
says
فَلَسْتُ وَإِنْ أَقْصَرْتُ عَنْهُ بِمُقْصِرِ
meaning, But although thou blame in order that
I may be restrained, I do not refrain from that
which I desire to do. (El-Mázinee, L.) Also,
قَصَرْتُ طَرْفِى [I restrained my eye, or eyes;] I did
not raise my eye, or eyes, towards that at which
I ought not to look. (TA.) And قَصَرَ البَصَرَ He
turned away the eye. (TA.) It is also said in a

أَمْوَالِ اليَتَامَى Men were restricted to marrying no
more than four [because of the property of the
orphans which they might leave]. (TA.) And
one says قَصَرْتُ نَفْسِى عَلَى الشَّىْءِ I confined, or
restricted, myself to the thing, and obliged myself
to do it. (TA.) [See also 8.] Hence what is
said of Thumámeh, in a trad., فأَبَى أَنْ يُسْلِمَ قَصْرًا
But he refused to become a Muslim by constraint
and compulsion: or by force, as some say, from
القَسُرُ; the س being changed into ص, as is done
in many other cases. (TA.) You say also
قَصَرْتُ الشَّىْءَ عَلَى كَذَا I restricted the thing to
such a thing. (S, TA.) And قَصَرَهُ عَلَى الأَمْرِ,
meaning, رَدَّهُ إِلَيْهِ, (M, K,) i. e., [He reduced
him, to the thing, or affair; or] he appropriated
him [or it, restrictively,] to the thing, or affair.
(TK.) [Hence,] قَصَرْتُ اللِّقْحَةَ عَلَى فَرَسِى I
appropriated the milk of the milch-camel [restrictively] to my horse. (S, TA.) [And hence,]
قَصَرْتُ عَلَى نَفْسِى نَاقَةً I retained for myself [restrictively] a she-camel, that I might drink her
milk. (Msb.) Aboo-Du-ád says, describing a
horse,
فَقُصِرْنَ الشِّتَآءَ بَعْدُ عَلَيْهِ
وَهُوَ لِلذَّوْدِ أَنْ يُقَسَّمْنَ جَارٌ
meaning, So they were restricted to him, that he
might drink their milk, during the severity of the
winter, afterwards; and he is a protector to the
few she-camels from their being suddenly attacked
and divided in shares; مِنْ being understood before أَنْ. (M.)

-A2-  أَقْصَرَتْ She
brought forth short children: hence the saying,
إِنَّ الطَّوِيلَةَ قَدْ تُقْصِرُ وَإِنَّ القَصِيرَةَ قَدْ تُطِيلُ [Verily
the tall woman sometimes brings forth short children, and verily the short woman sometimes brings
forth tall children]. (S, K. *) J is in error in
saying that this is in a trad. (Sgh, K.) But
IAth also asserts it to be a trad. (MF in art.
طول.)
6
تقاصر He feigned, or pretended, (أَظْهَرَ,)
shortness; (M, Sgh, K;) as also ↓ تَقَوْصَرَ: (Sgh,

such a thing. (Msb.) ―

to be short. (S.) ―
-b2-  He reckoned him, or held
him, to fall short of doing what he ought to do: or
to flagg, or be remiss: عَدَّهُ مُقَصِّرًا. (S.)
Q. Q. 2
تَقَوْصَرَ, said of a man, (M,) He
became contracted; lit., one part of him entered
into another part; (M, K;) as though he became
like a قَوْصَرَّة, from which word the verb is derived. (Z, TA.) ―
-b2-  See also 6.
قَصْرٌ and ↓ قَصَرٌ and ↓ قُصْرَةٌ [like the inf. n. قُصُورٌ]
The falling, or stopping, or coming, short of accomplishing an affair; or of doing what one
ought, or is commanded, to do; or flagging, or
remissness: you say to a man whom you have
sent to accomplish some needful affair, and who
has fallen short of doing what you commanded
him to do, on account of heat or some other
cause, مَا مَنَعَكَ أَنْ تَبْلُغَ المَكَانَ الَّذِى أَمَرْتُكَ بِهِ إِلَّا
أَنَّكَ أَحْبَبْتَ القَصْرَ, and القَصَرَ, and القُصْرَةَ, i. e. أَنْ
تُقَصِّرَ [Nothing prevented thy reaching the place
to which I commanded thee to go but thy loving
to fall short &c.; or to flag, or be remiss]. (M,
K *.) And ↓ قَصَرَةٌ, (K,) or ↓ قَصَرٌ, without ة, accord.
to the Nawádir of IAar, as cited in the L, and
so in the handwriting of Sgh, (TA,) and ↓ قَصَارٌ,
(K,) signify Laziness; slothfulness. (IAar, Sgh,
K.) An Arab of the desert is related to have
said ↓ أَرَدْتُ أَنْ آتِيَكَ فَمَنَعَنِى القَصَارُ [I desired to
come to thee, but laziness prevented me]. (TA.)
-A2-  قَصْرُكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا and ↓ قَصَارُكَ, (S, M, K,)

↓ قُصَيْرَاكَ, (M, K,) Thine utmost, or the utmost of
thy power or of thine ability or of thy deed,
(جُهْدُكَ, M, K, [or app., جَهْدُكَ, (see art. جهد,)]
and غَايَتُكَ, S, M, K,) and the end of thy case,
and that to which thou hast confined or restricted
or limited thyself, (S, TA,) [or that to which thou
art confined or restricted or limited,] is, or will
be, thy doing such a thing. (S, M, K.) It is
from قَصْرٌ signifying the “ act of confining, restricting, limiting,” &c. (TA.) And ↓ قُصْرَى
also signifies the end of an affair. (Sgh, TA.)
A poet says
إِنَّمَا أَنْفُسُنَا عَارِيَّةٌ
وَالْعَوَارِىُّ قَصَارٌ أَنْ تُرَدْ
[Our souls are only a loan: and the end of loans
is their being given back; تُرَدْ being for تُرَدَّ]. (S,

TA:) and the first (S, K) and second (A'Obeyd,
TA) and third, (A'Obeyd, S, TA,) [the time of]
the mixing of the darkness: (A'Obeyd, S, K,
TA:) pl. of the second (TA) and third (S, M) and
fourth, (M,) مَقَاصِرُ (S, M) and مَقَاصِيرُ, which
latter is extr.; (M;) in the first sense, as signifying عَشَايَا; (M;) or in the last sense; (S;)
not signifying, as it is said to do in the K, العِشَآءُ
الآخِرَةُ; for this is a great mistake, app. occasioned by F's seeing the passage [in the T] of
Az, [or in the M, in which I find it,] وَالمَقَاصِرُ
وَالمَقَاصِيرُ العَشَايَا الأَخِيرَةُ نَادِرَةٌ, and not properly
considering it. (TA.) Sb says, that قَصْرٌ has no
dim.; the Arabs being content to use in its stead
the dim. of مَسَآءٌ. (M.) You say أَتَيْتُهُ قَصْرًا I
came to him in the afternoon, or evening; syn.
عَشِيًّا. (S.) And جِئْتُ قَصْرًا, and ↓ مَقْصَرًا, I

day:] a well-known kind of edifice: (M:) a

set upon the upper part of the back: (Nuseyr,

otherwise: (Lh, M:) pl. [or coll. gen. n.] قَصَرٌ,
and pl. pl. [or pl. of قَصَرٌ] أَقْصَارٌ: (M:) or this
latter is pl. of قَصَرَةٌ, (M, K,) accord. to Kr, but
this is extr., unless the augmentative letter in the
sing. be disregarded in its formation. (M.)
I'Ab reads كَالْقَصَرِ, in the Kur, lxxvii. 32, (S, M, *
TA,) and explains it as meaning Like the thick
bases of necks, (M, * TA,) or as meaning كَقَصَرِ
النَّخْلِ, i. e. الأَعْنَاق. (S.) [See the next signification.] You say ذَلَّتْ قَصَرَتُهُ [His neck or] the
base of his neck became in a state of subjection.
(TA.) And إِنَّهُ لَنَامُّ القَصَرَةِ Verily he has a
large, or thick, neck. (Aboo-Mo'ádh the Grammarian.) ―
-b2-  And hence, (Aboo-Mo'ádh,) (tropical:)  The
trunks, or lower-parts, (أُصُول, M, K, or أَعْنَاق,

pieces of the length of a cubit, to make fires
therewith in the winter: (Aboo-Mo'ádh:) and
