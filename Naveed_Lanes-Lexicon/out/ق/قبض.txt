He took it with his hand, (A, O, K,) by actual
touch, or feel: (O:) or the former signifies he

hand; syn. أَمْسَكَهُ: (A, K:) or he seized it
(أَنْحَى عَلَيْهِ) with the whole of his hand: (M:)
or he closed, or contracted, his fingers upon it:
(Mgh, Msb:) it is also said, by MF, that
some assert قَبْضٌ to signify the “ taking with the
ends of the fingers; ” but this is a mistranscription, for قَبْضٌ, with the unpointed ص. (TA
[in which it is said, in another place in this art.,
that ↓ تَقْبِيضٌ has also this last signification; but
this is evidently, in like manner, a mistranscription, for تَقْبِيضٌ.]) You say, قَبَضَ المَتَاعَ
[He took, or received, the commodity, or the commodities, or goods]. (A.) And قَبَضَ مِنْهُ الدَّيْنَ
[He took, or received, from him the debt]. (M,

Kur, [xx. 96,] فَقَبَضْتُ قَبْضَةً مِنْ أَثَرِ الرَّسُولِ, (M,)
and, accord. to an extraordinary reading, ↓ قَبِيضَةً,
(B,) meaning [And I took a handful] of the dust
from the footstep of the hoof of the horse of
the messenger [Gabriel]: (IJ, M:) and ↓ إِقْتَبَضَ

or comprehended, the bird in his grasp. (A.)
And قَبَضَ عَلَى عُرْفِ الفَرَسِ [He grasped, or laid

-b2-  It is

an absolute property in a thing, to dispose of it
at pleasure, without respect to the hand; as in
the phrase قَبَضْتُ الأَرْضَ, and الدَّارَ, (tropical:)  I had, or
took, or got, possession of the land, and of the
house. (TA.) And [in like manner] it is said

قَبَضْتُهُ عَنِ الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  I removed him from the thing,
or affair. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  قَبَضَهُ, aor. as above, (M,
K,) and so the inf. n., (S, M, Mgh,) also signifies
the (assumed tropical:)  contr. of بَسَطَهُ; (S, * M, Mgh, * K;) and so
↓ قبّضهُ, (IAar, M,) inf. n. تَقْبِيضٌ. (TA.) [As

You say, قَبَضَ رِجْلَهُ وَبَسَطَهَا (tropical:)  [He contracted his
leg, and extended it]. (A.) And قَبَضَ كَفَّهُ [He

(tropical:)  He (a bird, S, K, and a horse, A, and a man,
S, or other [animal], K,) was quick, (S, M, A,
K,) in flight, or in going or pace. (K.) يَقْبِضْنَ,

be] an ex. of this signification. (S, K. *) You

their pace; at every spring therein, putting their

or roughly, (Az, M.) or quickly: (S:) because

or scants, or makes scanty, the means of subsistence, to some, (Bd, Msb, * TA, *) or withholds

وَيَبْسُطُنِى مَا يَبْسُطُكَ (tropical:)  Verily what distresses thee,
or grieves thee, distresses, or grieves, me; and what

in a trad., that Mohammad said, فَاطِمَةُ مِنِّى
يَقْبِضُنِى مَا قَبَضَهَا وَيَبْسُطُنِى مَا بَسَطَهاَ (tropical:)  [Fátimeh is
as though she were a part of me: what hath distressed her, or grieved her, distresses, or grieves,
me; and what hath rejoiced her rejoices me].
(TA.) Or the phrase إِنَّهُ لَيَقْبِضُنِى مَا قَبَضَكَ,
mentioned by Lth, means (assumed tropical:)  Verily what hath
annoyed and angered thee annoys and angers
me. (Az, TA.) قَبْضٌ and بَسْطٌ are terms applied
by the investigators of truth among the Soofees
to two contrary states of the heart, from both of
which it is seldom or never free: the former
being an affection of the heart withholding it from
dilatation and joy; whether the cause thereof be
known, as the remembrance of a sin or an offence,
or of an omission, or be not known; and some of
them make other divisions thereof. (TA.) [In like
manner] you say also, عَنَّا فَمَا قَبَضَكَ ↓ اِنْقَبَضْتُ
(tropical:)  [Thou shrankest from us: and what made thee
to shrink?]. (A.) ―

(Bd,) and the literal signification is, [And the
earth altogether shall be] his handful [on the day
of resurrection]; (Bd, Jel;) meaning in his possession (Jel, TA) alone, (TA,) and at his free
and absolute disposal: (Jel:) Th says, that this
is like the phrase هٰذِهِ الدَّارُ فِى قَبْضَتِى, meaning
as explained above, voce قَبْضٌ; but this opinion
is not valid:) (M:) another reading is ↓ قَبْضَتَهُ, in

the grammarians; but it is not allowed by any
one of the grammarians of El-Basrah. (M.) It

explanation applies, (TA,) A man who lays hold
