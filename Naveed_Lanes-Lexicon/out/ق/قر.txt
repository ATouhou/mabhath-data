In the words of the Kur, [xxxiii. 33,] وَقِرْنَ فِى
بُيُوتِكُنَّ, and وَقَرْنَ, [And remain ye in your
houses, or chambers,] قِرْنَ and قَرْنَ are contractions of اِقْرِرْنَ and اِقْرَرْنَ like as ظِلْنَ and
ظَلْنَ are contractions of اِظْلِلْنَ and اِظْلَلْنَ: (M,

aor.
قَرِ3َ, inf. n. وَقَارٌ; (Bd, TA; *) and قَرْنَ from

Nawádir; and IKtt, the three forms of aor., and
so the author of the Ma'álim; but IKtt says, in
his Kitáb el-Abniyeh, يَقَرُّ and يَقِرُّ, though he
may have mentioned the three forms in another
book; and accord. to what is stated [in the M
and] in the L, Lh says يَقُرُّ and يَقَرُّ, which is a
rare form; (TA;) [on which it should be
remarked, that ISd, IKtt, and Mtr, mention the
form
قَرَ3َ first, as though to indicate its being the
more, or most, common;] inf. n. قَرٌّ, (Msb,) or
قُرٌّ, (IKtt, TA,) or the latter is a simple subst.;
(Msb;) It (the day, Lh, S, M, &c., and in like
manner one says of the night, قَرّتِ اللَّيْلَةُ, M)
was, or became, cold. (Lh, S, M, &c.) ―
-b2-  قُرَّ He
(a man) was, or became, affected, or smitten, by
the cold. But you do not say قَرَّهُ اللّٰهُ: instead of
this you say ↓ أَقَرَّهُ. (M, K.) ―

K;) inf. n. قُرَّةٌ, (Th, M, Msb, K,) said by Th to
be an inf. n., (M,) and قَرَّةٌ (M, K) and قُرُورٌ;
(M, Msb, K;) (tropical:)  His eye was, or became, cool,
or refrigerated, or refreshed; contr. of سَخِنَتْ;
(S, M;) wherefore some prefer that قَرَّتْ should
be of the measure فَعِلَتْ, to agree in measure
with its contr.: (M:) or became cool, &c., by
reason of happiness, or joy: (Msb:) or became
cool, &c., and ceased to weep, (M, K,) and to feel
hot with tears; (M;) for the tear of happiness,
or joy, is cool; and that of sorrow, or grief, is
hot: (S:) [it may therefore be rendered, his eye
was, or became, unheated by tears:] or it is from
القَرَارُ, and means, his eye, seeing that for which it
longed, became at rest, and slept. (M, K. *)
You also say قَرِرْتُ بِهِ عَيْنًا, and قَرَرْتُ بِهِ عَيْنًا,

namely, water: and he poured it, or poured it
out or forth, at once. (TA.) You say قَرَّ عَلَيْهِ
المَآءَ He poured the water upon him. (M, K.)
And قَرَرْتُ عَلَى رَأْسِهِ ذَنُوبًا مِنْ مَآءٍ بَارِدٍ I poured
upon his head a bucket of cold water. (S.) And
قَرَّ المَآءَ فِى الإِنَآءِ He poured the water into the
vessel. (TA.) ―

M,) inf. n. قَرٌّ, (Sh, S, M, K,) (tropical:)  He poured forth

(TA:) or he spoke it secretly into his ear: (M, *
K, * TA:) or he repeated it in his ear, meaning
the ear of a dumb man (أَبْكَم), that he might
understand it: (IAar:) or he put his mouth to
his ear and spoke loudly to him, as one does to a
deaf man. (Sh.)

(S, K.) You say أَنَا لَا أُقَارُّكَ عَلَى مَا أَنْتَ عَلَيْهِ I
will not settle, &c., with thee in the state in which
thou art. (TA.) And hence the saying of Ibn-Mes'ood, قَارُّوا الصَّلَاةَ, (S, * K,) from القَرَارُ, not
from الوَقَارُ, (S,) meaning, Be ye still, without
motion, and without play, during prayer. (TA.)

settled, fixed, established or confirmed, him, or it;

in this country, or town, &c., but thy being in it].

to rest in their nest. (Msb.) And اقرّ العَامِلَ
عَلَى عَمَلِهِ He left the agent to rest, [or settled,
fixed, or established, him, or made him to
continue, or confirmed him,] in his agency.
(Msb.) [And اقرّهُ عَلَى قَوْلِهِ He left him at rest
in his assertion, undisturbed, unopposed, or uncontradicted; he confirmed him in it; he confessed him to be correct respecting it. Thus the
verb is used in the phrase اقرّهُ عَلَى ذٰلِكَ in the
Expos. of the Jel., xxxviii. 22: and in many
other instances.] You say also الشَّىْءَ ↓ قرّر, inf. n.
تَقْرِيرٌ, meaning, He put the thing in its قَرَار [or

&c., this thing, or affair; or I confirmed it.]
(S.) And it is said in a trad. of 'Othmán,
أَقِرُّوا الأَنْفُسَ حَتَّى تَزْهَقَ Make ye the souls of the
beasts which ye slaughter to become at rest,
[and wait ye] that they may depart, and do not
hasten to skin the beasts, nor to cut them in
pieces. (TA.) And in a trad. of Aboo-Moosà,
أُقِرَّتْ الصَّلَاةُ بِالْبِرِّ والزَّكَاةِ Prayer is established
and connected with برّ and زكاة [i. e., benevolent
treatment of others or piety or obedience to God,
and the giving of the alms required by the law].
(TA.) ―

a right, or due, (S, M, K,) or a thing. (Msb.)
إِقْرَارٌ signifies The affirming a thing either with
the tongue or with the mind, or with both. (ElBasáïr.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] أَقَرَّتِ النَّاقَةُ, [as though
signifying The she-camel acknowledged, or confessed, herself to be pregnant;] the she-camel's
pregnancy became apparent: (IKtt, TA;) or
became established; became a positive fact:
(ISk, S, K:) or the she-camel conceived; became
pregnant. (IAar.)
-A4-  اقرّ He entered upon a
time of cold. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  اقرّهُ اللّٰهُ, (inf. n. إِقْرَارٌ,
Msb,) God caused him to be affected, or smitten,
by the cold. (S, * M, Msb, K.) One does not
say قَرَّهُ (M, K) ―
-b3-  اقرّ اللّٰهُ عَيْنُهُ, (S, M, Msb, K,)
and بِعَيْنِهِ, (M, K,) (tropical:)  God made his eye to become
cool, or refrigerated, or refreshed, (Msb, TA,) by
happiness, or joy, in consequence of his having
offspring, or of some other event: (Msb:) or
cooled his tears; for the tear of happiness, or joy,
is cool: (As:) or gave him to such an extent
that his eye became quiet (حَتَّى تَقَرَّ), and was not
raised towards him who was above him, (S, TA,)
or towards that which was above it: (L:) or
caused him to meet with that which contented
him, so that his eye became quiet (تَقَرَّ) in looking
at other things; an explanation approved and
adopted by Abu-l-'Abbás: (L, TA:) or caused
his eye to sleep, by making him to meet with
happiness, or joy, that dispelled his sleeplessness.

10
إِسْتَقْرَ3َ see 1, first signification, in three places; and
see 4. [―
-b2-  استقرّ often signifies It was, or subsisted,
or had being: and hence مُسْتَقِرٌّ is frequently used or
understood as a copula, often with بِ prefixed to
the predicate; as is also يَسْتَقِرُّ; so that رَيْدٌ مُسْتَقِرٌّ
عِنْدَكَ or يَسْتَقِرُّ عندك may mean Zeyd is with
thee; as well as Zeyd is residing, &c., with thee.
See, on this point, I 'Ak, p. 58.) ―

[cooed; or] uttered its cry: (S, K:) or uttered a
hind of cry: (M:) the inf. n. is قَرْقَرَةٌ and قَرْقَرِيرٌ,
(S, M, K,) which latter IJ says is of the
measure فَعْلَلِيْلٌ, thus making it a quadriliteralradical word, (M,) and قَرْقَارٌ and قَرْقَارٌ, which
last is a simple subst. as well as an inf. n., and
so is قَرْقرَةٌ. (El-Hasan Ibn-'Abd-Allah El-Kátib

called because the people on that day rest, or
settle, in their abodes: (S, M, Mgh:) or because
they rest on that day in [the valley of] Minè,
(A 'Obeyd, Kr, M, Msb, K,) after the fatigue
of the three days immediately preceding.

where its revolution ends; likened to the مستقرّ of
a traveller, when he ends his journey: or to the
middle of the sky; for it there seems to pause: or
to its state of settledness, &c., according to a
special path: or to its appointed end in one of the
different places of rising and setting which it has
on different days: or to the end of its course, in
the desolate part of the world: and accord. to

deposited in the womb. (TA.) You say also,
الْمُقَدَّسَةَ ↓ أَذْكَرَنِى الْمَقَارَّ [He, or it, reminded me
of the consecrated places of abode: مَقَارُّ is pl. of
↓ مَقَرٌّ]. (TA.) And one says, on the occasion of
a calamity befalling, ↓ صَابَتْ بِقُرٍّ, (S, Z, M, *) or
↓ وَقَعَتْ بِقُرٍّ, (K,) meaning, It (the calamity, الشِّدَّةُ,
S) became [or fell] in its قَرَار [or settled or fixed
place, or in the place where it should remain:] (S,
K:) or the thing came to its قَرَار: (M:) or it fell
in its place: (Z:) or it fell where it ought: (Th:)
and sometimes they said ↓ وَقَعَتْ بِقُرِّهَا [it fell in its
settled or fixed place, &c.]: (S:) and وَقَعَ الأَمْرُ
↓ بِقُرِّهِ, i. e. ↓ بِمُسْتَقَرِّهِ [the thing fell in the place
where it did, or should, rest, or remain]: (As:) and
one says to a man who seeks blood-revenge, when
he meets the slayer of his relation, ↓ وَقَعْتَ بِقُرِّكَ thy
heart has met that which it looked for. (TA.)
↓ لَقَدْ وَقَعْتُ بِقُرِّكَ, and ↓ بِقُحَاحِ قُرِّكَ, also means I
have become acquainted with all that thou knowest,
nothing thereof being hidden from me. (Ibn-Buzurj, in TA, art. قح.) One says also, [in
threatening another,] لَأُلْجِثَنَّكَ إِلَى قُرِّ قَرَارِكَ; a
prov., meaning, الى أَصْلِكَ وَجَهْدِكَ [i. e. I will
assuredly impel thee, or drive thee, against thy
will, to the utmost point to which thou canst go,
or be brought or reduced; and, constrain thee to
do thine utmost]. (JK. [Or the meaning is,
I will assuredly impel thee, or drive thee, against
thy will, to the place that thou deservest: or, to
the place where thou shalt remain: or, to thy
grave: or, to thy worst and lowest state or condition: see Freytag's Arab. Prov. ii. 450.]) ―

towns, or villages, and of cultivated land; syn.
حَضَرٌ. (TA.) Hence, أَهْلُ القَرَارِ [The people

-b3-  I. q. مَا قَرَّ فِيهِ, (as in a copy

water has remained, or been poured]; as also
↓ قَرَارَةٌ: (M, K:) a depressed piece of ground; as
also the latter word: (M, K:) or the latter is
applied to any depressed piece of ground into

M:) and to a round tract of level, or level and
depressed, ground: (IAar, S:) and to a low
meadow: (TA:) and to a small pool of water
left by a torrent: (TA, art. ثعجر:) and the
former of the two words is also explained as
signifying a depressed place where water rests:
so in the Kur, xxiii. 52: and a place where water
rests in a meadow: (TA:) and it is also a pl.,
[or rather a coll. gen. n.,] of which the sing. [or
n. un.] is ↓ قَرَارَةٌ: (As, M:) and قَرَارٌ is applied to
low grounds because water rests in them. (ISh.)
Ibn-' Abbás, mentioning 'Alee, said, عِلْمِى إِلَى
عِلْمِهِ كَالقَرَارَةِ فِى المُثْعَنْجَرِ My knowledge compared to his knowledge is like the small pool of
water left by a torrent, placed by the side of the

ثعجر.) ―

قَارُورَةٌ [A flask, bottle, or, as it generally
signifies in the present day, phial;] the thing in

قَوَارِيرَ قَوَارِيرَ مِنْ فِضَّةٍ, in the Kur, [lxxvi. 15 and
16,] is said by some learned men to mean Vessels,
[vessels] white as silver and clear as قوارير.
[See also art. فض.] An ا is added by some to
the final قوارير [of verse 15] in order that the ends
of the verses may be similar. (M.) ―

قَوْصَرَةٌ. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  (tropical:)  The black of the eye; the
part, of the eye, that is surrounded by the white:

Msb:) called by the former appellation because
the child, or the seed, rests in her womb, as a

Hence the words [of Mohammad] in a trad.,
رُوَيْدَكَ رِفْقًا بِالْقَوَارِيرِ [Go thou leisurely: act gently
with the قَوَارير]: women being here likened to
قوارير of glass because of their weakness of purpose, and their fickleness; for such vessels are
soon broken and cannot be restored to soundness:
meaning, that the man thus addressed, named
أَنْجَشَة (Anjesheh), [a freedman of Mohammad,]
should not raise his voice and sing in driving the
camels, for fear of the women's having their
desires excited by what they heard; or for fear
that the camels, hearing the singing, should go
quickly, and jolt and fatigue the riders. (TA.)

مَقْرُورٌ Affected, or smitten, by the cold: (S, M,
K:) from أَقَرَّهُ اللّٰهُ, contr. to rule; as though
formed from قُرَّ. (S.) [It seems that J was not
acquainted with the form قُرَّ, which is mentioned
in the M and K, or that he did not allow it.] ―
