قبص1
قَبَصَهُ, aor.
قَبِصَ, (M, A, K,) inf. n. قَبْصٌ, (S,
M,) He took it with the ends of his fingers; (S,
M, A, K;) the action which it denotes being less
than that termed قَبْضٌ; (M;) the latter signifying the “ taking with the whole of the hand; ”
(Bd, xx. 96;) as also ↓ قبصّهُ, (Ibn-'Abbád, K,)
inf. n. تَقْبِيصٌ. (TA.) Thus, accord. to one reading, [in the Kur, xx. 96,] فَقَبَصْتُ قَبْصَةً مِنْ أَثَرِ
الرَّسُولِ; (S, M, A, TA;) and, accord. to another,
قُبْصَةً; (TA;) [in each] with ص [in both
instances] instead of ض, with which the passage is
commonly read; (TA;) meaning, [And I took with
the ends of my fingers somewhat] of the dust from
the footstep of the horse of the messenger Gabriel.
(Jel.) [But see قبض.] You say also, قُبْصَةً ↓ إِقْتَبَصْتُ
[I took for myself somewhat with the ends of my
fingers]. (A.) And مِنْ أَنْوَارِكَ ↓ جِئْتُ لِأَقْتَبِسَ
وَأَقْتَبِصَ مِنْ آثَارِكَ (tropical:)  [I came to acquire of thy
lights of knowledge, and pick up somewhat of thy
traditions]. (A.)
