perhaps a trans. verb; for] قَسَّهُمْ signifies He
hurt them, or annoyed them, by foul speech;

to all the copies of the K, [so says SM, in the TA,
but in the CK ↓ قُسُّوسَة and ↓ قِسِّيسَة, and in a MS
copy of the K I find the latter written ↓ قَسِيسَة,]

He became a قَسّ [or قِسِّيس]: (K, * TK:) or
↓ قَسُوسَةٌ and ↓ قِسِيسَّةٌ [so in a copy of the M, but in
a copy of the A ↓ قُسُوسِيَّةٌ and ↓ قِسِّيسِيَّةٌ, which I
hold to be the correct forms of these two words,
the former from the pl. of قَسٌّ and the latter from
