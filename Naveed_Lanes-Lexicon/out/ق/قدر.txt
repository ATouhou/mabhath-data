قدر1
قَدَرْتُ الشَّىْءَ, aor.
قَدِرَ and
قَدُرَ, [or the former
only accord. to the Mgh., as will be seen by
what follows,] inf. n. قَدْرٌ, (S, Msb,) is from
التَّقْدِيرُ, (S,) [or] it signifies the same as ↓ قدّرتُ
الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. تَقْدِيرٌ: (Msb:) [which latter
phrase is afterwards mentioned in the S, but unexplained: the meaning is, I measured the thing;
computed, or determined, its quantity, measure,
size, bulk, proportion, extent, amount, sum,
limit or limits, or number:] الشَّىْءَ ↓ قدّر signifies
he computed, or determined, or computed by conjecture, the quantity, measure, size, bulk, proportion, extent, amount, sum, or number, of the
thing, (حَزَرَهُ,) in order that he might know how
much it was. (IKtt.) It is said in a trad., إِذَا
غُمَّ عَلَيْكُمُ الهِلَالُ فَاقْدِرُوا لَهُ, and فَاقْدُرُوا; (S,
Msb; *) or إِنْ غْمَّ عَلَيْكُمْ فَاقْدِرُوا, with kesr to the
د; (Mgh, Msb; *) for فَاقْدُرُوا, with damm, is
wrong; (Mgh;) and Ks. say, that you say
قَدَرْتُ الشَّىْءَ, aor. أَقْدِرُهُ, with kesr, and that he
had not heard any other aor.: (TA:) the meaning of the trad. is, [When the new moon (of
Ramadán) is hidden from you by a cloud or mist,
or if it be so hidden,] compute ye (↓ قَدِّرُوا) the
number of the days to it, (Mgh, Msb,) and so
complete Shaabán, making it thirty days: (S, *
Mgh, * Msb:) or, as some say, compute ye
(قَدِّرُوا) the mansions of the moon, and its course
in them [to it, i. e., to the new moon]. (Msb.)

-b2-  [Hence, app., the saying,] أُقْدُرْ
بِذَرْعِكَ بَيْنَنَا See thou and know thy rank, or
estimation, among us. (AO.) ―
-b3-  Hence also,]
مَا قَدَرُوا اللّٰهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ [Kur., vi. 91, and other
places, meaning, And they have not estimated
God with the estimation that is due to Him: or]
and they have not magnified, or honoured, God,
with the magnifying, or honouring, that is due to
Him: (S, K:) for قَدْرٌ signifies [also] a magnifying, or honouring: (K:) or have not assigned
to God the attributes that are due to Him:
(Lth:) or have not known what God is in reality.
(El-Basáïr.) ―
-b4-  قَدَرَ الشَّىْءَ بِالشَّىْءِ, aor. [
قَدِرَ and]
قَدُرَ,
(L,) inf. n. قَدْرٌ; (L, K;) and به ↓ قدّرهُ; (L;) He
measured the thing by the thing: (L, K: *) and
عَلَى مِثَالِهِ ↓ قدّرهُ he measured it by its measure:
(S, K, art. قيس:) and بَيْنَ الأَمْرَيْنِ ↓ قدّر he
measured, or compared, the two things, or cases,
together; syn. قَايَسَ; (K, art. قيس;) and so
بَيْنَهُمَا ↓ قَادَرَ. (L, art. قيس.) ―

قَدْرٌ, (S,) I made the garment according to his
measure; adapted it to his measure: (S, K: *)
[and قَدَرْتُ عَلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ app. signifies I made the
thing according to his, or its, measure; proportioned, or adapted, the thing to him, or it; for
وصفته, by which it is explained in the TA, seems
to be, as IbrD thinks, a mistake for وَضَعْتُهُ:]
and الشَّىْءَ ↓ قدّر signifies, in like manner, he made
the thing by measure, or according to a measure;
or proportioned it; syn. جَعَلَهُ بِقَدَرٍ: (IKtt:) the
primary meaning of ↓ تَقْدِيرٌ is the making a thing
according to the measure of another thing. (Bd-
xv. 60.) ―
-b7-  [Hence,] قَدَرَ اللّٰهُ ذٰلِكَ عَلَيْهِ, aor.
قَدِرَ
and
قَدُرَ, inf. n. قَدْرٌ and قَدَرٌ, (K,) or the latter is a
simple subst., (Lh, Msb,) and مَقْدَرَةٌ; (S [unless
this be a simple subst.];) and عليه ↓ قدّرهُ, (K,)
[which is more common,] inf. n. تَقْدِيرٌ; (TA;)
and لَهُ; (K;) [God decreed, appointed, ordained,
or decided, that against him; and for him, or to
him; accord. to an explanation of قَدَرٌ in the K:
or decreed, &c., that against him; and for him,
or to him; adapting it to his particular case;
accord. to an explanation of قَدَرٌ by Lth, and of
قَدْرٌ and قَدَرٌ in the S, and of قَدَرٌ in the Msb:
see قَدْرٌ, below.] You say also قَدَرَ اللّٰهُ لَهُ بِخَيْرٍ
[God decreed, &c., for him, good]. (K.) ―
-b8-  Also,
قَدَرَ, (K,) aor.
قَدِرَ and
قَدُرَ, inf. n. قَدْرٌ, (TA,) He
[God] distributed, divided, or apportioned, [as
though by measure,] sustenance, or the means of
subsistence. (K, TA. In the CK, the verb is
قَدَّرَ.) Hence, say some, the appellation of لَيْلَةُ
القَدْرِ, [in the Kur, ch. xcvii.,) as being The
night wherein the means of subsistence are apportioned. (TA.) See also قَدْرٌ, below. ―
-b9-  Also,
aor.
قَدِرَ and
قَدُرَ, but the former is that which is
adopted by the seven readers [of the Kur-án],
and is the more chaste, (Msb,) He (God)
straitened, or rendered scanty, [as though He
measured and limited,] the means of subsistence:
(Bd, xiii. 26, and other places; and Msb:) and
قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ, [see Kur, lxv. 7,] inf. n. قَدْرٌ, his
means of subsistence were straitened to him; like
قُتِرَ. (S, TA.) You say قَدَرُ عَلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ, aor.
قَدِرَ
and
قَدُرَ, (Lh, TA,) inf. n. قَدْرٌ (K,) and قَدَرٌ and
قُدْرَةٌ; (Lh, TA;) and ↓ قدّر, inf. n. تَقْدِيرٌ; (K;)
He rendered the thing strait, or distressing, to
him. (Lh, K, * TA.) And قَدَرَ عَلَى عِيَالِهِ He
scanted his household; or was niggardly or parsimonious towards them, in expenditure; like قَتَرَ.
(S.) It is said in the Kur, [xxi. 87,] فَظَنَّ أَنْ
لَنْ نَقْدِرَ عَلَيْهِ And he thought that we would not
straiten him: (Fr, AHeyth:) or the meaning is,
لَنْ نُقَدِّرَ عَلَيْهِ مَا قَدَّرْنَا مِنْ كَوْنِهِ فِى بَطْنِ الحُوتِ,
for نَقْدِر is syn. with نُقَدِّر; (Zj;) and this is
correct; i. e., we would not decree against him
what we decreed, of the straitness [that should
befall him] in the belly of the fish: it cannot be
from القُدْرَةُ [meaning power, or ability]; for he
who thinks this is an unbeliever. (Az, TA.) ―
-b10-
Also, قَدَرَهُ, aor.
قَدِرَ, inf. n. قَدَارَهٌ; (K;) and ↓ قدّرهُ;

time for it. (K.)
-A2-  قَدَرْتُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ, aor.
قَدِرَ (S,
Msb, K) and
قَدُرَ, (Ks, K,) but the former is that
which is commonly known, (TA,) inf. n. قُدْرَةٌ
and قِدْرَانٌ, (S, K,) with kesr, (K,) but the latter
is written in a copy of the T, قَدَرَانٌ, (TA,) [and
in one copy of the S قُدْرَانٌ,] and قَدْرٌ (Ks, Fr,
Akh, K) and مَقْدُرَةٌ and مَقْدَرَهٌ and مَقْدِرَهٌ (S, K)
and مِقْدَارٌ (K) and مَقْدَرٌ (TA) and قَدَارٌ (Sgh, K)
and قِدَارٌ; (Lh, K;) and قَدِرْتُ عَلَيْهِ, aor.
قَدَرَ, (S,
K, *) a form of weak authority, mentioned by
Yaakoob, (S,) and by Sgh from Th, and said
by IKtt, to be of the dial. of Benoo-Murrah, of
Ghatafán, (TA,) inf. n. قَدَرٌ (Ks, Fr, Akh, K)
and قَدَارَةٌ and قُدُورَهٌ and قُدُورٌ, (K, TA,) these
four are of قَدِرَ; (TA;) and all that are here
mentioned as from the K, are inf. ns.; (TK;)
and عليه ↓ اقتدرت; (S, K, * TA;) or this has a
stronger signification; (IAth;) I had power, or
ability, to do, effect, accomplish, achieve, attain,
or compass, &c., the thing; I was able to do it, I
was able to prevail against it. (Msb, K, * TA.)
You say مَا لِى عَلَيْكَ مَقْدُورَةٌ, and مَقْدَرَةٌ, and
مَقْدِرَةٌ, i. e. قُدْرَةٌ, [I have not power over thee.]
(S.) And in like manner, المَقْدُورَةُ تُذْهِبُ الحَفِيظَةَ
[Power drives away that care which one has of
what is sacred, or inviolable, or of religion, to
avoid suspicion]. (S.) ―
-b2-  See also قُدْرَةٌ, below.
-A3-  قَدَرَ and ↓ اقتدر are like طَبَخَ and إِطَّبَخَ [meaning
He cooked, and he cooked for himself, in a قِدْر,
or cooking-pot]. (S, TA.) You say قَدَرَ القِدْرَ,
(K, * TA,) aor.
قَدُرَ and
قَدِرَ, inf. n. قَدْرٌ, (K,) He
cooked [the contents of] the cooking-pot. (K, *
TA.) And أَمَرَنِى أَنْ أَقْدُرَ لَحْمًا He ordered me

-b3-  He intended a thing or an affair;
he determined upon it. (T.) [Said of God,

or made, such a thing to be supplied, or understood. You say تَقْدِيرُهُ كَذَا Its (a phrase's)
implied, or virtual, meaning, or meaning by implication, is thus. And يُقَدَّرُ بِكَذَا Its implied
meaning is to be expressed by saying thus. And
تَقْدِيرًا is said in the sense of implicatively, or
virtually, as opposed to لَفْظًا or literally. ―
-b5-  And
He supposed such a thing.] ―
-b6-  He made; syn.
جَعَلَ and صَنَعَ. Ex., in the Kur, [xli. 9,] وَقَدَّرَ
فِيهَا أَقْوَاتَهَا And He made therein its foods, or
aliments. And it is said in the Kur, [x. 5,]
وَقَدَّرَهُ مَنَازِلَ And hath made for it [the moon]

And قَرَأَ بِقَدْرِ الفَاتِحَةِ, and ↓ بِقَدَرِهَا, and ↓ بِمِقْدَارِهَا,

أَقَمْتُ عِنْدَهُ قَدْرَ أَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا I remained at his
abode long enough for him to do thus. (Meyd,
TA.) But you say ↓ جَآءَ عَلَى قَدَرٍ, thus only, with
fet-h [to the dál, as is shown by what precedes
in the Msb,] as meaning [It came according to
measure; i. e.,] it was conformable; it matched;
it suited. (Msb.) You say also جَاوَزَ قَدْرَهُ or
↓ قَدَرَهُ [He overstepped, transgressed, went beyond,
or exceeded, his proper measure, bound, or limit:
and the same is said of a thing]. (L, art. عند;

value, worth, account, rank, quality, or degree of
dignity;] greatness, majesty, honourableness, nobleness; (Msb, * TA;) gravity of character; (Msb;)
as also ↓ قَدَرٌ. (Msb.) You say مَا لَهُ عِنْدِى قَدْرٌ,
and ↓ قَدَرٌ, He has no honourableness, or gravity of
character, in my opinion. (Msb.) In the words of the
Kur, [vi. 91,] وَمَا قَدَرُوا اللّٰهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ, [for explanations of which see 1,] we may also correctly read

and مَا يُقَدِّرُهُ اللّٰهُ مِنَ القَضَآءِ, (S,) and القَضَآءُ الَّذِى
يُقَدِّرُهُ اللّٰهُ: (Msb:) [accord. to general usage, it
differs from قَضَآءٌ; this latter signifying a general
decree of God, as that every living being shall
die; whereas ↓ قَدَرٌ signifies a particular decree of
God, as that a certain man shall die at a particular time and place &c.; or particular predestination: thus القَضَآءُ وَالقَدَرُ may be rendered
the general and particular decrees of God; or
general and particular predestination or fate and
destiny. The term قَدَرٌ is variously explained by
different schools and sects: but its proper meaning seems to be that given above on the authority
of Lth.] The pl. of ↓ قَدَرٌ is أَقْدَارٌ; (K, TA;) and
of ↓ مَقَادِيرُ مِقْدَارٌ. (TA.) You say الأُمُورُ تَجْرِى

but see 8,) a thing, (JK,) or anything, (M, K,)

قِدْرٌ A cooking-pot; a vessel in which one cooks:

for an ex., 3 in art. غلو:)] of the fem. gender
(Msb, K, TA) without ة: (TA:) or it is made
fem. (S, K) as well as masc., accord. to some:
but he who asserts it to be made masc. is led into
error by a saying of Th: AM observes, as to the
saying of the Arabs, related by Th, مَا رَأَيْتُ قِدْرًا
غَلَى أَسْرَعَ مِنْهَا [I have not seen a cooking-pot that
has boiled quicker than it], قدر is not here meant
to be made masc. but the meaning is, ما رأيت شَيْئًا
غلى [I have not seen a thing that has boiled];
and similar to this is the saying in the Kur,
[xxxiii. 52,] لَا يَحِلُّ لَكَ النِّسَآءُ, meaning, لا يحلّ
لك شَىْءٌ مِنَ النِّسَآءِ: (TA:) the dim. is قُدَيْرٌ,
without ة, contr. to analogy; (S, TA;) or قُدَيْرَةٌ,
with ة, because قِدْرٌ is fem.; (Msb;) or both:
(TA:) and the pl. is قُدُورٌ: (Msb, K:) it has no
other pl. (TA.) [See a tropical ex. voce حامٍ.]

seeds, it is called طَبِيخٌ: (Lth, TA:) or what is
cooked in a قِدْر; (L, K:) as also ↓ قَادِرٌ: so in the
K; but this seems to be a mistake, occasioned by
a misunderstanding of the saying of Sgh [and
others] that قَدِيرٌ is the same as قَادِرٌ: or perhaps
the right reading of the passage in the K is
وَالقَدِيرُ القَادِرُ وَمَا يُطْبَخُ فِى القِدْرِ; and it has
been corrupted by copyists:) (TA:) [but this is
improbable, as the passage, if thus, would be in
part a repetition:] also cooked broth; (L;) and
so ↓ مَقْدُورٌ. (JK, L.)
قَدَارَةٌ: see قُدْرَةٌ.

قَادِرٌ, applied to God, i. q. ↓ مُقَدِّرٌ [Decreeing,
appointing, ordaining, deciding]; (S;) and ↓ قَدِيرٌ
may signify the same. (TA.)
-A2-  See also قَدْرٌ,
last signification.
-A3-  Possessing power, or ability;
as also ↓ قَدِيرٌ, (K,) and ↓ مُقْتَدِرٌ: (TA:) or قَدِيرٌ
has an intensive signification, and مُقْتَدِرٌ still
more so: (IAth:) or ↓ قَدِيرٌ signifies he who does
what he will, according to what wisdom requires,
not more nor less; and therefore this epithet is
applied to none but God; and مُقْتَدِرٌ signifies
nearly the same, but is sometimes applied to a
human being, and means one who applies himself, as to a task, to acquire power or ability.
(El-Basáïr.) When you say اَللّٰهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ
قَدِيرٌ [God is able to do everything; is omnipotent;]
you mean, to do everything that is possible.
(Msb.) ―

thy land and the land of such a one is a gentle
night's journey; (Yaakoob, S;) and between us
is an easy night's journey, in which is no fatigue.
