K;) they are made of skins, and of felt; are
worn by the women of the Arabs of the desert;
and extend to the bones of the elbow: (L, TA:) a
pair of them is called قُفَّازَانِ: (S, L:) or a thing
which the women of the Arabs of the desert make
for themselves, stuffed with cotton, covering a
woman's two hands, with her fingers, and, some
add, having buttons upon the fore arm; like what
the carrier of the falcon wears: (Msb:) or a
thing which those women make for themselves,
covering the fingers and hand and arm: and a
thing which the sportsman [meaning the falconer]
wears upon each hand, or hand and arm, of skin,
or of felt, or wool: (Mgh:) or a kind of women's
ornament for the hands and feet, or the hands
and arms and the feet and legs: and a reticulated
iron thing (حَدِيدَةٌ مُشَبَّكَةٌ, accord. to the TA, as

whose whiteness of the lower parts of his fore legs
extends as far as his مِرْفَقَانِ [properly signifying

K;) as though he had gloves (قُفَّازَانِ) put upon
