قهقرQ. 1
قَهْقَرَ, (K, TA,) inf. n. قَهْقَرَةٌ, (TA,) He
(a man) returned by the way by which he had
come: (TA:) or i. q. رَجَعَ القَهْقَرى, (K,) i. e.,
[he returned backwards; or] he retired, going
backwards, without turning his face towards the
direction in which he went; (TA;) as also ↓ تَقَهْقَرَ.
(K, TA.) Some hold, [contr. to the general
opinion,] that this verb belongs to art. قهر.
(TA.)
Q. 2
تَقَهْقَرَ see 1.
قَهْقَرَى A returning backwards; (S, K;) a
retiring, going backwards, without turning the
face towards the direction in which one goes:
(TA:) the dual is قَهْقَرَانِ; (IAmb, K;) like as
the dual of خَوْزَلَى is خَوْزَلَانِ; (TA;) without
ى, (K,) because this letter is deemed difficult to
pronounce with the ا and the ى of the dual.
(TA.) When you say رَجَعْتُ القَهْقَرَى [I returned
backwards; &c.], it is as though you said I
returned with the returning which is known by
this name; for القهقرى is a mode of returning.
(S.) ―
-b2-  مَشَى القَهْقَرَى He reverted from the state
in which he was, or from the course which he
was following; revolted; apostatized. (Az, from
a trad.)
