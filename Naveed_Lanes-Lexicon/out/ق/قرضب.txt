قرضبQ. 1
قَرْضَبَهُ He cut it; (S, K;) and so قَرْصَبَهُ;
(K in art. قرصب;) but the former is the more
approved: (TA in that art.:) and [the inf. n.]
قَرْضَبَةٌ signifies the cutting vehemently. (TA in
the present art.) [See also قِرْضَابٌ, below; first
sentence.] ―
-b2-  And He separated it; or separated
it into several, or many parts; or dispersed it;
i. e., a thing. (K.) ―
-b3-  And He collected it
together; namely, flesh-meat in a cooking-pot:
thus it has two contr. significations. (K.) ―
-b4-
And He ate it entirely; namely, flesh-meat:
(K:) and in like manner, قَرْضَبَ الشَّاةَ, said of the
wolf, he ate entirely the sheep, or goat. (TA.)
And [the inf. n.] قَرْضَبَةٌ is said to signify The
[eating indiscriminately,] not clearing, or freeing,
the moist, or tender, from the dry, or tough, by
reason of vehement voracity. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And
قرضب said of a man, He ate a dry, or tough,
thing. (S, O, K.) ―
-b6-  And He (a man) ran in
the manner termed عَدْوٌ: (K:) or قَرْضَبَةٌ signifies
[a running] such as falls short of what is termed
عَدْوٌ. (O.)
قِرْضِبٌ The refuse remaining in the sieve, that is
thrown away. (O, K, TA.)
قِرْضَابٌ A sharp sword; as also ↓ قُرْضُوبٌ: (O:)
or both signify a very sharp sword; (K;) as also
↓ قُرَاضِبٌ: (TA in art. قرطب:) or the first
signifies, (S,) or signifies also, (O,) a sharp
sword, that cuts bones. (S, O.) Both the first
and second of these words are compounded from
قَرَضَ and قَضَبَ, which signify “ he cut. ” (O.)

-b5-  And قِرْضَابٌ and ↓ قُرْضُوبٌ signify A
thief, or robber: pl. قَرَاضِبَةٌ. (S, O, K.) And
both words, (the latter, S, O, K, and the former
also, K, TA,) sometimes, (S,) A poor man; (S,
O, K, TA;) a pauper: (TA:) pl. as above.
(K, TA.) ―
