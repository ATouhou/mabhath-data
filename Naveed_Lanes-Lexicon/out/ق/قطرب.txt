قطربQ. 1
قَطْرَبَ, (K,) inf. n. قَطْرَبَةٌ, (O,) He
hastened, sped, or went quickly. (O, K.)
-A2-  And
قَطْرَبَهُ He threw him down, or prostrated him, on
the ground: (O, K: *) and so قَرْطَبَهُ. (O.)
Q. 2
تَقَطْرَبَ He (a man, TA) moved about his
head: and made himself to resemble the قُطْرُب:
(K:) or became like the قُطْرُب in some one of the
senses assigned to it in what follows. (TA.)
قُطْرُبٌ A certain bird; (S, O, K;) [app. a
species of owl; accord. to Dmr, as cited by Freytag, a bird that roves about by night and does not
sleep; and hence rendered by him, and by Golius,
strix. No other meaning of the word, as an
appellative, is mentioned in the S.] ―
-b2-  And A
certain insect that rests not all the day, going
about, or going about quickly, (O, K, TA,) or, as
they used to assert in the Time of Ignorance,
that never rests, (TA,) moving about on the surface
of water. (KL.) Mohammad Ibn-El-Mustaneer,
(K, TA,) the grammarian, (TA,) was surnamed
قُطْرُب because he used to go early in the morning
to Seebaweyh; so that the latter, whenever he
opened his door, found him there; wherefore he
said to him, مَا أَنْتَ إِلَّا قُطْرُبُ لَيْلٍ [Thou art none
other than a kutrub of night]. (K, * TA.) It is
also expl. in the K as meaning Light, or active;
and Th mentions that it signifies thus; and adds
that one says, إِنَّهُ لَقُطْرُبُ لَيْلٍ [Verily he is a
kutrub of night]; but this shows that it means an
insect [described above], and is not [properly
speaking] an epithet. (TA.) To this insect is
likened a man who labours during the day in
accomplishing worldly wants and in the evening
is fatigued so that he sleeps during the night
until he enters upon the time of morning to betake
himself to the like thereof, هٰذَا جِيفَةُ لَيْلِ قُطْرُبُ
نَهَارٍ [lit. This is a corpse of the night, a kutrub of
the day]. (O, from an explanation of a trad.)
[See also Freytag's Arab. Prov. i. 329 and 643.]
―
-b3-  And [hence, app.,] (assumed tropical:)  A thief who is skilful, or
active, in thievishness: (O, M, TA:) for اللِّصُّ
الفَارِهُ فِى اللُّصُوصِيَّةِ, an explanation of القُطْرُبُ
given [in the O and] by IM and others, the
copies of the K erroneously substitute اللِّصُ وَالفَأْرَةُ
[as though قُطْرُبٌ had the significations of a thief
and a rat or mouse]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And The male
(Lth, O, K, TA) of the [kind of demon called]
سِعْلَاة (Lth, TA) or of the غُول [which is said to
signify the same as سعلاة]; as also ↓ قُطْرُوبٌ. (O,
K, TA.) ―
-b5-  And [app. A young, or little, jinnee:
thus قُرْطُبٌ is expl. in the L: or] the young ones,
or little ones, of the jinn. (K.) ―
-b6-  And A young,
or little, dog: (O:) or the young ones, or little
ones, of dogs. (K.) ―
-b7-  And A wolf such as is
termed أَمْعَط [i. e. whose hair has fallen off, part
after part, or has become scanty; or mischievous,
or malignant]. (O, K.) ―
-b8-  And An ignorant
person, (O, K, TA,) who boasts by reason of his
ignorance (يَظْهَرُ بِجَهْلِهِ). (O, TA.) ―
-b9-  And
Cowardly, or a coward, (O, K, TA,) even if
intelligent. (O, TA.) ―
-b10-  And Lightwitted; syn.
سَفِيهٌ; (O, K, TA;) as also ↓ قُطْرُوبٌ: and IAar
has mentioned as a pl. in this sense, used by a
poet, قَطَارِيبُ, which, ISd says, may be pl. of
قُطْرُوبٌ or of a sing. of some other form requiring
such a form of pl., or it may be used as a pl. of
قُطْرُبٌ by poetic license. (TA.) ―
-b11-  And Thrown
down, or prostrated, on the ground, syn. مَصْرُوعٌ,
(O, K, TA,) by reason of diabolical possession or
wrestling. (O, * TA.)
-A2-  Also A species of
melancholia; (O, K, TA;) a well-known disease,
arising from the black bile; (TA;) mostly originating in the month of شُبَاط [February, O. S.];
vitiating, or disordering, the intellect, contracting
the face, occasioning continual unhappiness, causing
to wander about in the night, and rendering the
face أَخْضَر [here app. meaning of a dark, or an
ashy, dust-colour], the eyes sunken, and the body
emaciated. (O.) [A more ample discription is
given by Avicenna (Ibn-Seenà). in book iii.
pp. 315, et seq. SM states that he had not found
this in any other lexicon than the K. Golius explains the word as signifying Lycanthropia, on
the authority of Rhazes (Er-Rázee).]
قُطْرُوبٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
two places.
