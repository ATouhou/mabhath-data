قرظ1
قَرَظَهُ, aor.
قَرِظَ, inf. n. قَرْظٌ, He tanned it, (Msb,
TA,) namely, a skin, or hide, (Msb,) or a skin
for water or milk, (TA,) with قَرَظ, q. v. infra:
(Msb, TA:) or he dyed it therewith. (TA.) ―
-b2-
He plucked it, or gathered it, from the tree;
namely, what is called قَرَظ. (Msb.)
-A2-  قَرَظْتُهُ a
dial. var. of قَرَضْتُهُ, in the phrase قَرَظْتُهُ ذَاتَ
الشِّمَالِ, q. v. (Fr, K.) ―
-b2-  And [in like manner as
a dial. var. of قَرَضْتُهُ,] I cut it, or made it and
cut it according to a measure and pattern. (Fr.)
-A3-  قَرِظَ, aor.
قَرَظَ, He was, or became, a lord, master,
chief, or man of rank or quality, after being in a
base or abject state. (IAar, O, K; and T in art.
قرض.)
2
قرّظهُ, inf. n. تَقْرِيظٌ, He took extraordinary
pains, or exceeded the usual degree, in tanning it,
namely, a skin, or hide, with قَرَظ. (Z.) ―
-b2-  [And
hence, (see 6,)] (tropical:)  He praised, or eulogized, him,
he, the latter, being living; (S, K, TA;) تَأْبِينٌ
signifying the “ doing so when the man is dead; ”
(S;) the former signifies he did so truly or falsely.
(K.) And فُلَانٌ يُقَرِّظُ صَاحِبَهُ, and يُقَرِّضُهُ, (tropical:)  Such
a one praises his companion, falsely or truly.
(AZ, S, TA.) And يُقَرِّظُنِى بِمَا لَيْسَ فِىَّ (tropical:)  [He
praises me for that which is not in me]. (TA,
from a trad.) ―
-b3-  And He praised him immoderately: like فرّطهُ. (O in art. فرط.) ―
-b4-  Also,
[like قرّضهُ,] (assumed tropical:)  He dispraised him: (Kitáb el-Addád, cited by Freytag:) or it relates only to
praise and good; but تَقْرِيضٌ relates to good and
to evil. (TA in art. قرض.)
6
هُمَا يَتَقَارَظَانِ المَدْحَ (tropical:)  They two praise each
other; (S, K, TA;) from 2 in the first of the
senses assigned to it above; each embellishing the
other like as the قَارِظ embellishes the skin, or hide;
(Z, TA;) and يتقارضان is like it: (TA;) and
you say also, هُمَا يَتَقَارَظَانِ الخَيْرَ والشَّرَّ [They two
interchange good and evil, each with the other];
as also يتقارضان: (IKh, in TA, art. قرض:) or
تَقَارُظٌ relates only to praise and good; but تَقَارُضٌ,
to good and evil. (TA.)
قَرَظٌ, accord. to some, (Msb,) The leaves of the
سَلَم [mimosa flava], (Lth, S, Mgh, K,) with
which they tan; (Lth, S, Mgh;) but this assertion is [said to be] inaccurate; for the leaves are
called خَبَط, and camels are fed with them, and
they are not used for tanning: some say, that it
is a kind of tree; but this also is inaccurate; for
one says, “I plucked, or gathered, قَرَظ; ” and
trees are not plucked, or gathered: (Msb:) AHn
[contradicts this, however, for he applies this
word to a kind of tree, and] says, it is the best of
things with which hides are tanned in the land of
the Arabs; and these are tanned with its leaves
and its fruit: [the pods of the سَنْط, which is also
called قَرَظ, are used for tanning;] and in one
place he says, it is a large kind of trees, having
thick stems (سوق [app. a mistranscription for شَوْك,
thorns,]) resembling the walnut-tree, [in the Mgh,
evidently from the same source, “or, as some say,
a large kind of trees, having thick thorns (شوْك),
resembling the walnut-tree,”] the leaves of which
are smaller than those of the apple-tree, and it has
grains which are put into balances [for weights,
like as are those of the carob-tree]: it grows in
the low plains: (TA:) or a kind of tree, whereof
the سَنْط [mimosa Nilotica, also called acacia
Nilotica,] is a species: (M, K, in art. سنط:) [or,]
correctly speaking, it is [the fruit, or seed with its
pericarp, of that tree;] a well-known grain, which
comes forth in envelopes, like lentils, from the trees
called عِضَاه; (Msb;) or, [to speak more precisely,] the fruit of the سَنْط, whence is expressed
أَقَاقِيَا [acacia, i. e. succus acaciæ]; (K;) which is
termed عُصَارَةُ القَرَظِ, [and when inspissated, رُبُّ
القَرَظِ,] and has an acrid property; the best
thereof is that which is sweet in odour, heavy, hard,
and green; and it strengthens relaxed members,
when cooked in water, and poured upon them:
(Ibn-Jezleh, TA:) [the last application is that
which commonly obtains in the present day: see
also 'Abd-el-Lateef, pp. 48-52 of the Arabic
text, and De Sacy's translation and notes:] the
n. un. is قَرَظَةٌ: (AHn, Mgh, Msb:) and the dim.
of this is قُرَيْظَةٌ. (AHn, Msb.) Hence بِلَادُ القَرَظِ,
applied to El-Yemen, because the قَرَظ grows there
[most plentifully]. (S.) See also صَمْعٌ.
قَرَظِىٌّ The dye (صِبْغ [a mistranscription for
دِبْع i. e. tan]) of the قَرَظ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also
مَقْرُوظٌ. ―
-b3-  إِبِلٌ قَرَظِيَّةٌ Camels that eat قَرَظ. (TA.)
―
-b4-  كبش قَرَظِىٌّ and قُرَظِىٌّ A ram of El-Yemen;
because the قَرَظ grows there [most plentifully].
(S, K.)
قَرَّاظٌ A seller of قَرَظ. (Msb, K.)
قَارِظٌ A plucker, or gatherer, of قَرَظ. (S, Msb,
K.) It is said in a proverb, (S,) لَا آتِيكَ أَوْ يَؤُوبُ
القَارِظُ العَنَزِىُّ [I will not come to thee unless the
gatherer of قرظ, of the tribe of 'Anazeh, return]:
(S, K, but in the latter العنزى is omitted:) and
Aboo-Dhu-eyb says,
وَحَتَّى يَؤُوبَ القَارِظَانِ كِلَاهُمَا
[And until the two gatherers of قرظ return, each
of them]: (S:) the قَارِظَانِ were two men of the
tribe of 'Anazeh, who went forth in search of قَرَظ,
and did not return. (S, K.) We also find in the
M, لَا آتِيكَ القَارِظَ العَنَزِىَّ, i. e. I will not come to
thee as long as the gatherer of قرظ, of the tribe of
'Anazeh, is absent: القارظ العنزى being made to
occupy the place of الدَّهْرَ, and being put in the
accus. case as an adverbial expression, by an
extension of the signification, of which there are
parallel instances. (TA.)
تَقْرِيظ: see 2. [Used as a subst., (tropical:)  An encomium, or eulogy, on a living person: pl. تَقَارِيظُ and
تَقْرِيظَاتٌ.]
مُقْرَظٌ: see what next follows.
مَقْرُوظٌ A skin, or hide, tanned with قَرَظ; (S,
Msb, K;) as also ↓ قَرَظِىٌّ; and AHn mentions,
on the authority of Aboo-Mis-hal, ↓ مُقْرَظٌ, as
though from أَقْرَظَهُ, which, he says, we have not
heard: (TA:) or dyed therewith. (K.)
