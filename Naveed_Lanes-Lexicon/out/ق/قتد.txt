التَّقْتِيدُ [or تَقْتِيدُ القَتَادِ] signifies The cutting
of the trees called قَتَاد [q. v.], and burning them,
(L, K,) i. e. burning [off] their thorns, (L,) and
then giving them as fodder to the camels, (L, K,)
which fatten upon them on the occasion of
drought: (L:) one says, قتّد القَتَادَ, inf. n. as
above, He (a man) scorched, or slightly burned,
the extremities of the قتاد with fire: (O:) the
man comes, in the year of drought, and kindles
fire among them, so that he burns their thorns,
then he feeds his camels therewith: (T, O, TA:)
one says of him who does this, قتّد إِبِلَهُ [i. e. He
fed his camels with قتاد thus prepared]: so says
Ibn-'Abbád: (O:) and the act [of burning &c.]
is called التَّقْتِيدُ. (T, TA.)

a [camel's saddle that is called] رَحْل: (S, O, L:)
or one of the things that compose the apparatus of a
رَحْل: or the whole apparatus thereof: (L:) pl.
[of mult.] قُتُودٌ and [of pauc.] أَقْتَادٌ (S, O, L) and
أَقْتُدٌ: (L:) but accord. to the Basrees, قُتُودٌ,
signifying the pieces of wood of a رَحْل, has no
singular. (Ham p. 662.)
قَتِدٌ [part. n. of قَتِدَ said of a camel: see 1].
One says إِبِلٌ قَتِدَةٌ, and قَتَادَى, [the latter being
pl. of the former,) Camels having a complaint
(Ks, S, O, K) of their bellies (Ks, S, O) in consequence of eating of the trees called قَتَاد: (Ks, S,

O.)

قَتَادٌ [a coll. gen. n., The tragacanth-tree;] a
species of thorny tree; this is the larger sort;
(S;) a species of thorny and hard tree, which
bears a pod, and of which the fruit is like that of
the سَمُر [or gum-acacia-tree], growing in Nejd
and Tihámeh; n. un. with ة; (L;) it is a
species of hard tree having thorns like needles;
(K;) a species of tree having thorns like needles,
and a small dust-coloured leaf, and a fruit growing therewith of the same colour, resembling the
date-stone; (AHn, O, * L;) the large قتاد [thus
described] produces large wood, and its thorns are
curved and short, and it is of the [class termed]
عِضَاه; (Aboo-Ziyád, L;) or it is not reckoned
among the عِضَاه: (AHn, L: [but this assertion
may perhaps be meant to apply to the smaller
sort: respecting the larger, see also 1 and 2:])
the smaller sort is a species of tree of which the
fruit is a bladder (نُفَّاخَة) like that of the عُشَر
[q. v.]; (S, O, L;) accord. to the ancient Arabs
of the desert, it is not tall, being of the size of a
man sitting; (L;) and this sort grows upwards,
no part of it spreading, consisting of twigs, or
shoots, in a collected state, every one of which is
full of thorns from its top to its bottom. (Aboo-Ziyád, L.) It is said in a prov., مِنْ دُونِهِ خَرْطُ
القَتَادِ [expl. in art. خرط, first paragraph].
(S, L.)
إِبِل قَتَادِيَّةٌ Camels that eat the trees called قَتَاد.
(AHn, K.)
قُتَائِدَةٌ, (S, O, K,) occurring in a verse of 'AbdMenáf Ibn-Riba [cited in art. اذا, p. 40, col. iii.],
(S, O,) is the name of a certain عَقَبَة [or mountain-road], (S, O, K,) or a ثَنِيَّة [which is said by
some to be syn. with عَقَبَة]; (K;) [and if so, it
is properly imperfectly decl.;] or any ثَنِيَّة is
called قُتَائِدَةٌ. (K.)
