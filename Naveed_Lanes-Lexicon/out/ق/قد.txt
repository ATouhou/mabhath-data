قَدَّهُ, aor.
قَدُ3َ, (S, M, O, L, Msb,) inf. n. قَدٌّ;
(S, M, A, O, L, Msb, K;) and ↓ قدّدهُ, (M, L,)
[but this app. has an intensive signification, or
denotes repetition of the action, or its relation to
several objects,] inf. n. تَقْدِيدٌ; (L, K;) and
↓ اقتدّهُ, (M, L,) inf. n. اِقْتِدَادٌ; (K;) He cut it
in an enlongated form; or lengthwise: (IDrd, M,
L, K:) or slit, split, clave, rent, or divided, it,
(namely, a thong, &c., S, O, L, and a garment,
or piece of cloth, L,) lengthwise: (S, M, A, O,
L, Msb, K:) and he cut it off entirely: (M, L,
K:) or he cut it, or cut it off, in an absolute
sense: (TA:) he cut it, namely, a skin: and he
rent it, namely, a garment, or piece of cloth, or
the like. (L.) One says, ضَرَبَهُ بِالسَّيْفِ فَقَدَّهُ
بِنِصْفَيْنِ [He smote him with the sword and clave
him in halves,] (L, Msb, *) or قَدَّهُ نِصْفَيْنِ. (A.)
And قَدَّ القَلَمَ وَقَطَّهُ [He slit the writing-reed, and
nibbed it, or cut off its point breadthwise, or
crosswise]: (A, TA:) [for] قَطَّهُ is opposed to
قَدَّهُ: (S and TA in art. قط:) and both of these
verbs occur in a trad. describing 'Alee's different
modes of cutting [with the sword] when contracting himself and when stretching himself up.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And [hence] قَدَّ, (S, M, A, L,) inf. n.
قَدٌّ, (M, L, K,) (tropical:)  He clave, cut through by
journeying, or passed through, the desert, (S, M,
A, O, L, K,) and the night. (M, L) ―
-b3-  And
قَدَّ بِهِ الطَّرِيقُ, (so in a copy of the M,) or قَدَّتْهُ
الطَّرِيقُ, (so in the L and TA,) aor. and inf. n.
as above, (M, L, TA,) i. q. قَطَعَهُ (M) or قَطَعَتْهُ
(L, TA) (tropical:)  [The road cut him off, app. from his
companions, or from the object of his journey:
compare قَطَعَ بِهِ and قُطِعَ بِهِ]. ―
-b4-  And قَدَّ الكَلَامَ,
(M, L,) inf. n. as above, (M, L, K,) i. q. قَطَعَهُ
(M, L, K *) and شَقَّهُ (M, L) [both of which explanations may here mean, as قَطَعَ الكَلَامَ
generally does, (assumed tropical:)  He cut short, or broke off, the
speech; or ceased from speaking: or both may
here mean, as قَطَعَ الكَلَامَ sometimes does, he
articulated speech, or the speech: compare this
latter rendering with an explanation of شَقَّقَ
الكَلَامَ]. ―
-b5-  [قَدَّهُ also signifies He cut it out, or
shaped it, in any manner, whether lengthwise or
otherwise; like قَتَّهُ: see this latter, and a verse
cited as an ex. of its inf. n.: and see also a
saying near the end of the first paragraph of art.
فرى. Hence] قُدَّ فُلَانٌ قَدَّ السَّيْفِ [Such a one
was shaped with the shaping of the sword] means
(tropical:)  such a one was made goodly, or beautiful, in
respect of التَّقْطِيع [i. e. conformation, or proportion, &c., like as is the sword]. (S, O, L,
TA.) [See also قَدٌّ, below.] ―
-b6-  And قُدّ means
also (assumed tropical:)  He suffered a pain [app. what may be
termed a cutting pain] in the belly, called قُدَاد.

implied in the L,) or قدّد اللَّحْمَ, (A, O, *) inf. n.
تَقْدِيدٌ, (O, L,) He made قَدِيد [i. e. he cut flesh-meat into strips, or oblong pieces, and spread
them in the sun, or salted them and spread them
in the sun, to dry]. (L.)
-A2-  قدّد عَلَيهِ, said of a

―
-b4-  And, said of a company of men (قَوْمٌ), It

said of flesh-meat,] It was, or became, dry; or
it dried, or dried up. (K, TA.) ―
-b6-  And تقدّدت
said of a she-camel, She became somewhat lean
(O, K) after having been fat: (O:) or she
became fat, (TA,) or began to become fat, after
having been lean. (K, TA.)
7
انقدّ, (S, M, A, O, L, Msb, K,) and ↓ تقدّد,
(M, L, K,) [but the latter app. has an intensive
signification, or is said of a number of things,]
the former said of a skin, and of a garment, or
piece of cloth, (A,) not said of aught except
some such thing as a bag for travelling-provisions
and for goods or utensils &c., and such as clothing, (O,) It became cut in an elongated form; or
lengthwise: (L, K:) or became slit, split, cloven,
rent, or divided, lengthwise: (S, M, A, O, L, Msb,
K:) or became cut off entirely: (M, L, K:) or
became cut, or cut off. (TA.)

'Abbád, O, K, TA.) And استقدّت الإِبِلُ (assumed tropical:)  The
camels went on undeviatingly, in one course, way,
or manner: (O, K:) so says AA. (O.)
قَدْ is a noun and a particle: (S, O, Mughnee,
K:) and as a noun it is used in two ways.
(Mughnee, K.) ―
-b2-  (I) It is a noun syn. with
حَسْبُ; (S, O, Mughnee, K;) generally used
indeclinably; (Mughnee, K;) thus accord. to
the Basrees; with the د quiescent; (TA;)
because resembling قَدْ the particle in respect of
the letters composing it, and many other particles
in respect of its form, (Mughnee, TA,) such as
عَنْ and بَلْ &c.: (TA:) one says, قَدْ زَيْدٍ دِرْهَمٌ
[The sufficiency of Zeyd (i. e. what is sufficient
for Zeyd) is a dirhem], (Mughnee, K,) with the
د quiescent; (Mughnee, * K, * TA;) and قَدِى
(S, O) and قَدْنِى (S, O, Mughnee) [both] meaning حَسْبِى [My sufficiency (i. e. what is sufficient
for me)]; (S, O;) the ن in قَدْنِى being inserted in order to preserve the quiescence [of the
final letter of the noun] because this is the
original characteristic of what they make indeclinable; (Mughnee;) but the insertion of the
ن in this case is anomalous, for it is [by rule]
only added in verbs, by way of precaution, [to
prevent the confusion of the pronominal affix of
the verb and that of the noun,] as in ضَرَبَنِى: (S,
O:) [see, however, in the next sentence, an explanation of قَدْنِى accord. to which the ن is inserted regularly:] accord. to Yaakoob, using قَدْ
in the sense of حَسْبُ, one says, مَا لَكَ عِنْدِى إِلَّا
هٰذَا فَقَدْ i. e. فَقَطْ [There is nothing for thee with
me, or nothing due to thee in my possession,
except this, and it is a thing sufficient, or it is
enough, فَقَطْ being held to signify properly
فَحَسْبُ, but it is commonly used as meaning and
no more]; and he asserts it [i. e. قَدْ] to be a substitute [for قَطْ]: (M:) and it is also used
declinably; (Mughnee, K;) thus accord. to the
Koofees; (TA;) but this is rare: (Mughnee:)
one says قَدُ زَيْدٍ, making it marfooa, (Mughnee,
K,) like as one says حَسْبُهُ; and قَدِى without
ن [as mentioned above,] like as one says
حَسْبِى. (Mughnee.) ―
-b3-  (2) It is also a verbal
noun, syn. with يَكْفِى: one says, قَدْ زَيْدًا دِرْهَمٌ
[A dirhem suffices, or will suffice, Zeyd], and
قَدْنِى دِرْهَمٌ [A dirhem suffices, or will suffice,
me]; (Mughnee, K;) like as one says يَكْفِى زَيْدًا
دِرْهَمٌ, and يَكْفِيْنِى دِرْهَمٌ. (Mughnee, K. *)
-A2-  As
a particle, it is used peculiarly with a verb,
(Mughnee, K,) [i. e.] as such it is not preposed
to anything except a verb, (S, O,) either a pret.
or an aor., (TA,) from which it is not separated
unless by an oath, (Mughnee,) such as is perfectly inflected, enunciative, (Mughnee, K,) not
an imperative, (TA,) affirmative, and free from
anything that would render it mejzoom or man-
soob, and from what is termed حَرْف تَنْفِيس [i. e.
سَوْفُ and its variants]: and it has six meanings.
(Mughnee, K.) ―
-b2-  (1) It denotes expectation:
(M, Mughnee, K:) and when it is with an aor.,
this is evident; (Mughnee;) one says قَدْ يَقْدَمُ
الغَائِبُ, (Mughnee, K,) meaning It is expected
that the absent will come: (TA:) and most
affirm that it is thus used with a pret.: (Mughnee:) accord. to some, (M,) it is used in reply
to the saying لَمَّا يَفْعَلْ [i. e. “ He has not yet
done ” such a thing, which implies expectation
that he would do it]; (S, M, O;) the reply
being, قَدْفَعَلَ [Already he has done the thing]:
(M:) and Kh asserts that it is used in reply
to persons expecting information; (S, M, * O,
Mughnee;) [for to such] you say, قَدْ مَاتَ فَلَانٌ
[Already such a one has died]; but if one inform
him who does not expect it, he does not say thus,
but he says [merely] مَاتَ فُلَانٌ: (S, O:) thus
some say قَدْ رَكِبَ الأَمِيرُ [Already the commander has mounted his horse] to him who expects his mounting: some, however, disallow
that قَدْ is used to denote expectation with the
pret. because the pret. denotes what is already
past; and hence it appears that those who affirm
it to be so used mean that the pret. denotes
what was expected before the information:
(Mughnee: [in which it is added, with some
other observations, that, in the opinion of its
author, it does not denote expectation even with
the aor.; because the saying يَقْدَمُ الغَئِبُ denotes
expectation without قَدْ:]) MF says, What we
have been orally taught by the sheykhs in ElAndalus is this, that it is a particle denoting the
affirmation of truth, or certainty, when it occurs
before a pret., and a particle denoting expectation
when it occurs before a future. (TA.) ―
-b3-  (2)
It denotes the nearness of the past to the present:
(O, Mughnee, K:) so in the saying قَدْ قَامَ زَيْدٌ
[Zeyd has just, or just now, stood; a meaning
often intended by saying merely, has stood];
(Mughnee, K;) for this phrase without قد may
mean the near past and the remote past;
(Mughnee;) and so in the saying of the muëdhdhin, قَدْ قَامَتِ الصَّلَاةُ [The time of the rising to
prayer has just come, or simply has come]: (O:)
[and, when thus used, it is often immediately
preceded by the pret. or aor. of the verb كَانَ;
thus you say, كَانَ قَدْ ذَهَبَ He had just, or
simply had, gone away; and يَكُونُ قَدْ ذَهَبَ He
will, or shall, have just, or simply have gone
away:] and accord. to the Basrees, except Akh,
it must be either expressed or understood immediately before a pret. used as a denotative of
state; as in [the saying in the Kur ii. 247,]
وَمَا لَنَا أَلَّا نُقَاتِلُ فِى سَبِيلِ اللّٰهِ وَقَدْ أُخْرِجْنَا مِنْ دِيَارِنَا
وَأَبْنَائِنَا [And what reason have we that we should
not fight in the cause of God when we have been
expelled from our abodes and our children?]; and
in [the saying in the Kur iv. 92,] أَوْ جَاؤُوكُمْ
حَصِرَتْ صُدُورُهُمْ أنْ يُقَاتِلُوكَمْ [Or who come to
you, their bosoms being contracted so that they
are incapable of fighting you, or their bosoms
shrinking from fighting you]; but the Koofees
and Akh says that this is not required, because
of the frequent occurrence of the pret. as a denotative of state without قَدْ, and [because] the
primary rule is that there should be no meaning,
or making, anything to be understood, more
especially in the case of that which is in frequent
use: (Mughnee:) Sb [however] does not allow
the use of the pret. as a denotative of state without قَدْ; and he makes حصرت صدورهم to be an
imprecation [meaning may their bosoms become
contracted]: (S in art. حصر; in which art. in
the present work see more on this subject:) and
the inceptive لَ is prefixed to it like of the saying,
إِنَّ زَيْدًا لَقَدْ قَامَ [Verily Zeyd has just stood, or
has stood]; because the primary rule is that it is
to be prefixed to the noun, and it is prefixed to
the aor. because it resembles the noun, and when
the pret. denotes a time near to the present it resembles the aor. and therefore it is allowable to
prefix it thereto. (Mughnee.) [See also the
two sentences next after what is mentioned below
as the sixth meaning.] ―
-b4-  (3) It denotes rareness,
or paucity; (Mughnee, K;) either of the act
signified by the verb, (Mughnee,) as in [the
saying], قَدْ يَصْدُقُ الكَذُوبُ [In some few instances
the habitual liar speaks truth]; (Mughnee, K;)
or of what is dependent upon that act, as in [the
saying in the Kur xxiv. last verse,] قَدْ يَعْلَمُ مَا
أَنْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ [as though] meaning أَنَّ مَا هُمْ عَلَيْهِ هُوَ
أَقَلُّ مَعْلُومَاتِهِ [so that it should be rendered At
least He knoweth that state of conduct and mind
to which ye are conforming yourselves]: but some
assert that in these exs. and the like thereof it
denotes the affirmation of truth, or certainty; [as
will be shown hereafter;] and that the denoting
of rareness, or paucity, in the former ex. is not
inferred from قَدْ, but from the saying الكَذُوبُ
يَصْدُقٌ. (Mughnee.) ―
-b5-  (4) It denotes frequency; (Mughnee, K;) [i. e.] sometimes (S,
O) it is used as syn. with رُبَّمَا [as denoting frequency, as well as with رُبَّمَا in the contr. sense,
mentioned in the next preceding sentence]: (S,
M, O:) thus in the saying (S, M, O, Mughnee,
K) of the Hudhalee, (M, Mughnee,) or 'Abeed
Ibn-El-Abras, (IB, TA,)
قَدْ أَتْرُكُ القِرْنَ مُصْفَرًّا أَنَامِلُهُ
[Often I leave the antagonist having his fingers'
ends become yellow]. (S, M, O, Mughnee, K.) ―
-b6-
(5) It denotes the affirmation of truth, or certainty: thus in [the saying in the Kur xci. 9,]
قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَنْ زَكَّاهَا [Verily, or certainly, or
indeed, or really, he prospereth, or will prosper,
who purifieth it; (namely, his soul;) each pret.
here occupying the place of a mejzoom aor.]:
(Mughnee, K:) and thus accord. to some in [the
saying in the Kur xxiv. last verse, of which
another explanation has been given above,] قَدْ
يَعْلَمُ مَا أَنْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ [Verily, or certainly, &c., He
knoweth that state of conduct and mind to which
ye are conforming yourselves]. (Mughnee.) ―
-b7-
(6) It denotes negation, (Mughnee, K,) accord.
to ISd, (Mughnee,) occupying the place of مَا,
(M,) in the saying, قَدْ كُنْتَ فِى خَيْرٍ فَتَعْرِفَهُ,
(M, Mughnee, K,) with تعرف mansoob, [as
though meaning Thou wast not in prosperity,
that thou shouldst know it,] (Mughnee, K,) heard
from one of the chaste in speech: (M:) but this
is strange. (Mughnee.) ―
-b8-  [When it is used to
denote the nearness of the past to the present, as
appears to be indicated by the context in the O,]
قَدْ may be separated from the verb by an oath;
as in قَدْ وَاللّٰهِ أَحْسَنْتَ [Thou hast, by God, done
well] and قَدْ لَعَمْرِى بِتُّ سَاهِرًا [I have, by my
life, or by my religion, passed the night sleepless].
(O, Mughnee. [In the latter, this and what
here next follows are mentioned before the explanations of the meanings of the particle; probably because the meaning in these cases can
hardly be mistaken.]) And the verb may be
suppressed after it, (M, * O, Mughnee,) when its
meaning is apprehended, (O,) or because of an
indication; (Mughnee;) as in the saying of En-Nábighah (M, O, Mughnee) Edh-Dhubyánee,
(O,)
أَفِدَ التَّرَحُّلُ غَيْرَ أَنَّ رِكَابَنَا
لَمَّا تَزُلْ بِرِحَالِنَا وَكَأَنْ قَدِ
[The time of departure has drawn near, though
the camels that we ride have not left with our
utensils and apparatus for travelling, but it is as
though they had (left)]; meaning كَأَنْ قَدْ زَالَتْ.
(M, O, Mughnee.) ―
-b9-  If you make قَدْ an اِسْم [i. e.
a subst. or a proper name], you characterize it by
teshdeed: therefore you say, كَتَبْتُ قَدًّا حَسَنَةً [I
wrote a beautiful قد]; and so you do in the case
of كَىْ and هُوَ and لَوْ; because these words have
no indication of what is deficient in them [supposing them to be originally of three radical
letters], therefore it is requisite to add to the last
letter of each what is of the same kind as it, and
this is incorporated into it: but not in the case of
ا; for in this case you add ء; thus if you name a
man لَا, or مَا, and then add at the end of it ا, you
make it ء; for you make the second ا movent,
and ا when movent becomes ء: (S, O:) so says
J, [and Sgh has followed him in the O,] and
such is the opinion of Akh and of a number of
the grammarians of El-Basrah [and of El-Koofeh
(MF)], and F has quoted this passage in the B
and left it uncontradicted: but IB says, (TA,)
[and after him F in the K,] this is a mistake:
that only is characterized by teshdeed of which
the last letter is infirm: you say, for هُوَ, (IB, K,)
used as the name of a man, (IB,) هُوٌّ, (IB, K,)
and for لَوْ you say لَوٌّ, and for فِى you say فِىٌّ;
(IB;) and such is characterized by teshdeed only
in order that the word may not be reduced to one
letter on account of the quiescence of the infirm
letter [which would disappear] with tenween [as
it does in دَمٌ and يَدٌ &c.]: (K:) but as to قَدْ, if
you use it as a name, you say قَدٌ; (IB, K;) and
for مَنْ you say مَنٌ, and for عَنْ you say عَنٌ;
(K;) like يَدٌ (IB, K) and دَمٌ &c.: (K:) F,
however, [following IB,] is wrong in calling J's
statement a mistake; though the rule given by
him [and IB] is generally preferred. (MF,
TA.)
قَدٌّ The skin of a lamb or kid: (M, A, L, Msb,
K:) or [only] of a kid: (S, O, L:) or, accord.
to IDrd, a small skin, but of what kind he does
not say: (M, L:) pl. (of pauc., S) أَقُدٌّ and (of
mult., S) قِدَادٌ (ISk, S, M, L, Msb, K) and [of
pauc. also] أَقِدَّةٌ, which is extr. (M, L.) Hence
the saying, ↓ فُلَانٌ مَا يَعْرِفُ القَدَّ مِنَ القِدِّ Such a
one knows not the skin of a lamb, or kid, from the
thong. (A.) And hence, (O, K,) it is said in a
prov., (S, M, A, O,) مَا يَجْمَلُ قَدَّكَ إِلَى أَدِيمِكَ
(S, M, A, O, K) What approximates thy skin
of a lamb, or kid, to thy hide [of a full-grown
beast]? meaning, accord. to Th, (assumed tropical:)  what makes
the great to be like the little? (M: [or the little
to be like the great?]) or meaning what induces
thee to make thy small affair [appear] great?
(S:) or what approximates thy small [affair] to
thy great? (O, K:) applied to him who transgresses his proper limit; (M, O, K;) and to him
who compares the contemptible with the noble.
(O, K.) ―
-b2-  See also قِدٌّ, in two places.
-A2-  Also
(assumed tropical:)  The measure, quantity, size, or bulk, (M, L,
Msb, K,) of a thing: (M, L:) (tropical:)  the conformation, or proportion, syn. تَقْطِيع, (S, M, A, O,
L, K,) of a thing, (M, L,) or of a young woman,
(A,) or of a man: (K:) (tropical:)  the stature, syn. قَامَة,
(S, A, O, L, K,) of a man: (K:) (assumed tropical:)  his justness
of form, or symmetry: (M, L, K:) and (assumed tropical:)  his
figure, person, or whole body: (M, L:) pl. [of
pauc.] أَقُدٌّ (M, L, K) and أَقِدَّةٌ, (K,) which is
extr., (TA,) and [of mult.] قُدُودٌ (M, L, K) and
قِدَادٌ. (K.) One says, هٰذَا عَلَى قَدِّ ذَاكَ (assumed tropical:)  This
is equal in measure, quantity, size, or bulk, to that;
is like that. (Msb.) And شَىْءٌ حَسَنُ القَدِّ (assumed tropical:)  A
thing goodly, or beautiful, in respect of conformation, or proportion. (L.) And جَارِيَةٌ حَسَنَةُ القَدِّ (tropical:)  A
young woman goodly, or beautiful, in respect of
stature, and of conformation, or proportion. (A.)
And غُلَامٌ حَسَنُ القَدِّ (assumed tropical:)  A young man goodly, or
beautiful, in respect of justness of form, or symmetry, and in person, or the whole of his body.
(M, L.)
-A3-  See, again, قِدٌّ.
-A4-  By the phrase
يَا وَيْلَ قَدٍّ, addressed to Mikdád, in a verse of
Jereer, is meant يَا وَيْلَ مِقْدَادٍ [O, woe to thee
Mikdád]; the poet restricting himself to some of
the letters [of the name]: an instance [more
obviously] of a similar kind is سَلَّام used by El-
Hoteiäh for سُلَيْمَان. (O.)
قُدٌّ A certain marine fish, (O, K,) the eating of
which is said to increase [the faculty of] الجِمَاع.
(O.)
قِدٌّ A thing that is مَقْدُود [i. e. cut in an
elongated form, &c.]. (M, L.) ―
-b2-  [And hence]
A thong cut from an untanned skin, (S, M, * A,
O, * L, Msb, K,) with which sandals or shoes are
sewed, (M, * L, Msb,) and with which a captive
is bound; (A;) pl. أَقُدٌّ: (S, O, L:) and [as a
coll. gen. n.] thongs, cut from an untanned skin,
with which camels' saddles and [the vehicles called]
مَحَامِل are bound: (M, L:) and ↓ قِدَّةٌ [of which
the pl. is قِدَدٌ] is a more special term, (S, O, L,)
signifying a single thong of this kind. (K.) See
an ex. voce قَدٌّ. ―
-b3-  And (hence, L) A whip; (O,
L, K;) as also ↓ قَدٌّ. (K.) Thus in the trad.,
لَقَابُ قَوْسِ أَحَدِكُمْ وَمَوْضِعُ قِدِّهِ فِى الجَنَّةِ خَيْرٌ مِنَ
الدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا, (O, * L,) or ↓ قَدِّهِ, (K,) i. e. Verily
the space that would be occupied by the bow of any
one of you, and the place that would be occupied
by his whip, in Paradise, are better than the
present [sublunary] world and what is in it: or
قِدّه may here have the meaning next following.
(L.) ―
-b4-  A sandal; because cut in an elongated
form from the skin: (O, L:) or a sandal not
stripped of the hair, in order that it may be more
pliant. (IAar, O, L.) ―
-b5-  And A vessel of skin.
(S, O, K.) One says, مَا لَهُ قِدٌّ وَلَا قِحْفٌ He has
not a vessel of skin nor a vessel of wood: (S, O,
M:) or a skin nor a fragment of a drinking-cup

قَدِيدِيُّونَ, (IAth, O, K, TA,) thus accord. as
a trad., in which it occurs is related, (IAth, TA,)
not to be pronounced with damm, (K,) or, as

ق and fet-h to the [first] د, (IAth, TA,) and thus

O, K, TA,) such as the repairer of cracked wooden
bowls, and the farrier, (O, K, TA,) and the
blacksmith: (O, TA:) of the dial. of the people
of Syria: as though they were called by the
former appellation because of the tattered state of
their clothing; (O;) or by the latter as though,
by reason of their low condition, they wore the
small مِسْح called قُدَيْد; or from التَّقَدُّدُ, because
they disperse themselves in the provinces on account of need, and because of the tattered state of
their clothing; and the diminutive form denotes
mean estimation of their condition: (IAth, TA:)
a man (IAth, O, TA) of them (O) is reviled by
its being said to him يَا قَدِيدىُّ (IAth, O, TA)
and يا قُدَيْدِىُّ: (IAth, TA:) and it is commonly
used in the language of the Persians also. (O.)

region of the Jordan, (K,) or, as is said in the
Marásid and the Moajam, near Adhri'át, in the
Howrán; (TA;) wrongly said by J to be without teshdeed to the د, for the wine called مَقَدَىٌّ
is different from that called مَقَدِّىٌّ: (K:) or it is
wine boiled until it is reduced to half its original
quantity; likened to a thing that is divided (قُدَّ)
in halves; so accord. to Rejá Ibn-Selemeh, and
