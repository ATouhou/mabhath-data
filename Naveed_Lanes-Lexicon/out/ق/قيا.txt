K, &c.,) He vomited (Mgh, TA) what he had
eaten. (Mgh, Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence one says,]
قَآءَ نَفْسَهُ [lit. He vomited his soul], meaning (assumed tropical:)  he
died: like لَفَظَ نَفْسَهُ. (A, TA.) And قَآءَتِ الطَّعْنَةُ
الدَّمَ (assumed tropical:)  [The wound made with a spear or the like
spouted forth the blood]. (A, TA.) And ثَوْبٌ
يَقِىْءُ الصِبْغَ (assumed tropical:)  A garment that is saturated with the
dye. (S, A, O, K.) And تَقِىْءُ الأَرْضُ أَفْلَاذَ كَبِدِهَا
[lit. The earth will vomit the pieces of her liver],
meaning (tropical:)  the earth will cast forth upon her surface her treasures. (TA, from a trad.) And
قَآءَتِ الأَرْضُ أُكُلَهَا [lit. the earth vomited her food],
meaning (tropical:)  the earth disclosed her herbage and her

أَقْيَاَ see what immediately precedes.
5
تقيّأ He constrained himself to vomit; (S,
Mgh, O, Msb, TA;) and he vomited intentionally.
(TA.) See also 10, in two places.
-A2-  And
تَقَيَّأَتْ She addressed, or presented, herself to her
husband, and threw herself upon him: (K:) or,
accord. to Lth, she affected languor, or languidness, to her husband, and threw herself upon him:
but in the opinion of Az, the verb with ق in this
sense is a mistranscription, and is correctly تفيّأت,
[q. v.,] with ف. (TA.)
10
استقآء, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,) or استقيَأَ,
(thus in the O, in which the former is not mentioned, [and it seems from an ex. in a verse there
cited that this may be a dial. var.,]) and ↓ تقيّأ,
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, TA,) He constrained himself to vomit: (S, Mgh, O, Msb: [see the latter
verb above: in the K neither is expl.:]) or the
former is an instance of اِسْتَفْعَلَ from القَىْءُ [i. e.
it signifies he desired to vomit]: and ↓ the latter
signifies more than the former, i. e. he made what
was in the جَوْف [here meaning stomach] to come
forth, intentionally. (TA.) It is said in a trad.,
لَوْ يَعْلَمُ الشَّارِبُ قَائِمًا مَا ذَا عَلَيْهِ لَاسْتَقَآءَ مَا شَرِبَ [If
the person drinking in a standing posture knew
what would be the effect upon him, he would desire
to vomit what he had drunk: for the drinking
and the eating in that posture are forbidden in
more than one trad.]. (TA.)
قَىْءٌ originally an inf. n.: then applied to signify
Vomit; i. e. vomited food. (Msb.) It is said
in a trad., الرَّاجِعُ فِى هِبَتِهِ كَالرَّاجِعِ فِى قَيْئِهِ [He
who takes back his gift is like him who swallows
back his vomit]. (S.)
قُيَآءٌ a subst. (K, TA) similar to عُطَاسٌ and دُوَارٌ
[and many other words of the same form applied
to maladies; indicating that it signifies A complaint that causes much, or frequent, vomiting].
(TA.) One says, بِهِ قُيَآءٌ, meaning [In him is a
complaint in consequence of which] he is vomiting
much, or frequently. (ISk, S, O.)
قَيُوْءٌ One (a man, IAar) who vomits much, or
frequently; as also قَيُوٌّ; (IAar, K, TA;) the
latter formed from the former, like مَقْرُوٌّ from
مَقْرُوْءٌ. (L, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, [دَوَآءٌ قَيُوْءٌ,] Medicine
that is taken to cause vomiting; (ISk, S, O;)
and so ↓ دَوَآءٌ مُقَيِّئٌ (K, TA) and ↓ مُقِىْءٌ. (TA.)
مُقِىْءٌ and مُقَيِّئٌ: see what immediately precedes.
