قنت1
قُنُوتٌ is the inf. n. of قَنَتَ, (MA, Msb,)
aor.
قَنُتَ, (Msb,) and signifies The being obedient:
(S, M, MA, Mgh, K, TA:) or the being constantly obedient: (IAmb, O, TA:) the former is
the primary meaning: and hence, in the Kur
[xxxiii. 35], ↓ وَالْقَانِتَاتِ ↓ وَالْقَانِتِينَ [And the obedient
men and the obedient women]. (S, M, TA.)
One says, قَنَتَ لِلّٰهِ, (MA,) and قَنَتَ اللّٰهَ, (TA,)
[but this latter is unusual, the former only being
authorized by the Kur-án (in iii. 38 and xxxiii.
31),] meaning He was obedient to God. (MA,
TA.) And it is said in the Kur [ii. 110 and
xxx. 25], ↓ كُلٌّ لَهُ قَانِتُونَ i. e. All are obedient
unto Him: but the meaning here is, that the
beings in heaven [and earth] are created by the
will of God, and that none of them can alter the
form in which it is created; the obedience here
spoken of being obedience to the will [of God],
not the obedience of religious service; some of
them being obedient [in this sense], and others
being disobedient. (L, TA.) [It is said that]
the proper signification of ↓ القَانِتُ [or the signification that implies all the meanings of the word]
is The performer of the command of God. (L,
TA.) ―
-b2-  It signifies also The act of standing;
(Mgh, TA;) mentioned by Th, and asserted by
him to be the primary meaning. (TA.) And
(TA) The standing long. (IAmb, O, TA.) And
(TA) The standing in the performance of the
divinely-appointed act of prayer. (S, Msb, K,
TA.) [See also 4.] Hence, (Mgh, Msb, TA,)
it is said in a trad. (S, TA) of the Prophet, as a
reply given by him to the question أَىُّ الصَّلَاةِ
أَفْضَلُ, (TA,) أَفْضَلُ الصَّلَاةِ طُولُ القُنُوتِ (S, Mgh,
Msb, TA) i. e. [The most excellent characteristic
of the performance of the divinely-appointed act
of prayer is] the long continuance of the standing.
(Mgh, * Msb, * TA.) And hence, قُنُوتُ الوِتْرِ;
(S; [see art. وتر;]) or [as it is also termed] دُعَآءُ
القُنُوتِ, which means The supplication of the
standing; (Msb;) for one utters the supplication
standing: (TA:) and what is thus termed (دُعَآءُ
القُنُوتِ) is as follows: اَللَّهُمَّ إِنَّا نَسْتَعِينُكَ وَنَسْتَغْفِرُكَ
وَنُؤْمِنُ بِكَ وَنَتَوَكَّلُ عَلَيْكَ وَنُثْنِى عَلَيْكَ الخَيْرَ وَلَا
نَكْفُرُكَ وَنَخْلَعُ وَنَتْرُكُ مَنْ يَفْجُرُكَ اَللّٰهُمَّ إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ
وَلَكَ نُصَلِّى وَنَسْجُدُ وَإِلَيْكَ نَسْعَى وَنَحْفِدُ نَرْجُو رَحْمَتَكَ
وَنَخْشَى عَذَابَكَ إِنَّ عَذَابَكَ بِالكُفَّارِ مُلْحِقٌ i. e. O God,
verily we beg of Thee aid to be obedient and to
forsake disobedience, and we beg of Thee forgiveness of sins, [and we believe in Thee, and we rely
upon Thee,] and we laud Thee well, and we will
not be unthankful to Thee for Thy favour, and
we cast off and forsake him who disobeys Thee:
[O God, Thee we worship, and to Thee we perform the divinely-appointed act of prayer, and
prostrate ourselves;] and we are quick in working
for Thee and in serving Thee: we hope for Thy
mercy, and we dread Thy punishment: verily Thy
punishment overtakes the unbelievers; thus this
clause is expl. on the authority of Ks: or, as some
say, it means, causes others to overtake, or become
associated with, the unbelievers. (Mgh. [See also
art. لحق.]) It is said of the Prophet, قَنَتَ شَهْرًا
فِى صَلَاةِ الصُّبْحِ بَعْدَ الرُّكُوعِ يَدْعُو عَلَى رِعْلٍ وَذَكُوَانَ
[He stood during a month, in the prayer of daybreak, after (the prayers of) the رُكُوع (pl. of
رَكَعَ, q. v.), cursing (the tribes of) Rial and
Dhekwán]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also The act of supplicating [God]: (Zj, Mgh, O, Msb, K, TA:)
this is the signification [most] commonly known.
(Zj, Mgh, O, TA.) And [particularly, accord.
to general usage,] The supplicating God [by addressing Him with the form of words mentioned
above as used in what is termed دُعَآءُ القُنُوتِ], doing
so standing. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And The divinely-appointed act of prayer; syn. صَلَاةٌ. (IAmb, O,
TA.) ―
-b5-  And The being silent; (O, Msb, K,
TA;) by which is meant (O, * TA) the withholding oneself from talking; (O, * K, TA;) in,
or during, [the prayer called] الصَّلَاة. (O, * Msb,
TA.) Hence, (O, Msb, TA,) accord. to a trad.,
(O, TA,) the saying in the Kur [ii. 239], وَقُومُوا
↓ لِلّٰهِ قَانِتِينَ [And stand ye unto God, in the
divinely-appointed act of prayer, refraining from
talking]. (O, Msb, TA.) ―
-b6-  And The serving of
God. (TA.) ―
-b7-  And The continuing of the performance of the pilgrimage. (TA.) One says,
[قَنَتَ and] ↓ اقنت, meaning He continued the
performance of the pilgrimage. (IAar, O, K,
TA.) ―
-b8-  And The prolonging of engaging in
warring, or warring and plundering. (TA.)
One says, [قَنَتَ and] ↓ اقنت, meaning He prolonged the engaging in warring, or warring and
plundering. (IAar, O, K, TA.) ―
-b9-  And The confessing, or acknowledging, one's being in the condition of a servant [to God]. (TA.) ―
-b10-  And
The being lowly, humble, or submissive: (A, TA:)
or the keeping to obedience [to God], with lowliness, humility, or submissiveness. (Er-Rághib,
TA.) One says, قَنَتَ لَهُ He was, or became,
lowly, humble, or submissive, to him. (TA.) And
قَنَتَتِ المراة لِزَوْجِهَا, (A,) or لِبَعْلِهَا, (TA,) The
woman was, or became, lowly, humble, or submissive, and obedient, to her husband: (A:) or was,

-A2-  قَنَاتَةٌ [is an inf. n.,
of which the verb is قَنُتَ, like قَتُنَ, and] signifies
The eating little [like قَتَانَةٌ]. (K.)
4
اقنت He stood long in the performance of
the divinely-appointed act of prayer. (O, K.)
[And قَنَتَ has the same, or nearly the same,
meaning; as is shown above.] ―
-b2-  Also, [like
قَنَتَ عَلَى عَدُوِّهِ,] He cursed his enemy. (IAar,
O, K.) ―
-b3-  See also 1, last quarter, in two places.
―

and obedient [to her husband]. (A.)
قَنِيتٌ A woman who eats little: (O, K:) as
also قَتِينٌ. (O.) ―
-b2-  سِقَآءٌ قَنِيتٌ i. q. مِسِّيكٌ, so in
a copy of the K, meaning [A skin] that retains
the water; and this is the right explanation:
(TA:) but accord. to AZ and Z, the word مسيك
thus used is like أَمِيرٌ; and سِقَآءٌ مَسِيكٌ is expl. by
Z as meaning [a skin] that does not exude, and by
AZ as meaning [a skin] that retains the water so
that it does not exude: (TA in art. مسك:) in the
present art., in some of the copies of the K, مُسِيلٌ,
the act. part. n. from أَسَالَ المَآءَ; and thus in a
copy of the Tekmileh. (TA in the present art.:
in the O, in this art., it is مَسِيلٌ.)
قَانِتٌ [part. n. of قَنَتَ in all its senses]: see three
exs. in the first quarter of the first paragraph,
and another ex. in the last quarter; its [broken]
pl., in all its senses is قَنَّتٌ. (ISd, TA.)
