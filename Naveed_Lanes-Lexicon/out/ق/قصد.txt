He means وَيَنْبَغِى أَنْ يَقْصِدَ; but as he makes an
ellipsis, and puts يقصد in the place, syntactically, of ينبغى, he makes it marfooa, because it
has the place of that which is [virtually] marfooa:
and Fr says, he makes it marfooa because of the
disagreement; for as its meaning disagrees with
that of the preceding verb, it is made to disagree
therefore in desinential syntax. (S, L.)

heard them sing what is of the metre called
الخفيف: (M, L:) such poetry is thus termed
because composed with purpose and consideration,
and earnest endeavour to make it excellent; from
قَصْدٌ as syn. with أَمٌّ: or because composed with
care, and trimmed with excellent expressions and
choice meanings, from قَصِيدٌ signifying “ thick
and fat marrow; ” for the Arabs tropically apply
to chaste, or eloquent, or excellent, language the
epithet سَمِين, or “ fat: ” (L:) or because of its
completeness, and the soundness of its measure.
