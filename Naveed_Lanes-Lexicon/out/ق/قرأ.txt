قرأ1
قَرَأَ الشَّىْءَ, [aor.
قَرَاَ,] inf. n. قُرْآنٌ, He collected
together the thing; put it, or drew it, together;
(S, O, K, TA;) part to part, or portion to portion. (S, O, TA.) [This seems to be generally
regarded as the primary signification.] ―
-b2-  Hence
the saying of the Arabs, مَا قَرَأَتْ هٰذِهِ النَّاقَةُ سَلًى قَطُّ
and مَا قَرَأَتْ جِنِينًا, meaning This she-camel has not
contracted her womb upon a young one: (S, O,
TA:) but most say that the meaning is, her
womb has not comprised, or enclosed, a fœtus: or
the former saying means she has not borne a fœtus:
accord. to AHeyth, this same saying and مَا قَرَأَتْ
مَلْقُوحًا are both said to mean, by some, she has
not borne in her womb a young one (??): and by
some, she has not let fall a young one, ever; i. e.
she has not been pregnant: and accord. to ISh,
one says, ↓ ضَرَبَ الفَحْلُ النَّاقَةَ عَلَى غَيْرِ قَرْءٍ [which
seems to mean The stallion covered the she-camel
without her bringing forth, or becoming pregnant;
for he adds that قرء الناقة means ضعتها; app. ضَعَتُهَا
or ضِعَتُهَا; but I have not found ضَعَةٌ nor ضِعَةٌ
among the inf. ns. of وَضَعَتْ meaning “ she
brought forth; ” and I rather think that the right
reading is ضَغَنُهَا or ضِغْنُهَا, and that the meaning
therefore is, without her inclining, or being desirous: see 10, third sentence; and see قَرْءُ الفَرَسِ]:
and there is another saying; that لَمْ تَقْرَأْ جَنِينًا
means She has not, or did not, cast forth a fœtus,
or a young one. (TA.) One says also, of the
she-camel, (K, TA,) and of the ewe, or she-goat,
(TA,) قَرَأَتْ, alone, meaning She became pregnant:
(K, TA:) and likewise, of the pregnant [in
general], or of the she-camel, accord. to different
copies of the K, (TA,) meaning she brought forth:
(K, TA:) ISh says that قَرَأَتْ is used in relation
to a she-camel; and ↓ أَقْرَأَتْ, in relation to a
woman: [each, app., in the former sense and in
the latter:] and that one says ↓ نَاقَةٌ قَارِئٌ; pl.
نُوقٌ قَوَارِئُ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See also 4.
-A2-  قَرَأَ الكِتَابِ,
(S, O, Msb, * K, *) and بِهِ, (Msb, * K,) the verb
being trans. by itself and by means of ب, or this
particle is redundant, (Msb,) and sometimes the
ء is suppressed, so that one says [قَرَى and] قَرَيْتُ
&c., (TA,) aor.
قَرَاَ and
قَرُاَ, (K,) the latter aor. on
the authority of Ez-Zejjájee, as is said in the L,
but generally ignored, (TA,) inf. n. قِرَآءَةٌ and قُرْآنٌ
(S, O, Msb, K) and قَرْءٌ, (Msb, K,) this last
mentioned by Az; (Msb;) and ↓ اقترأهُ; (K;)
He read [the book, or Scripture], or recited [it]:
(K, TA:) or قَرَأْتُ القُرْآنَ means [properly, or
etymologically, accord. to some,] I uttered [the
words of] the Kur-án in a state of combination
[or uninterruptedly]; (O, TA;) as Ktr is related
to have said: (O:) [or قَرَأَ as used in a case of
this kind app. signifies properly he read, or
recited, the Scripture chanting; like as أَنْشَدَ
properly signifies “ he recited ” poetry “ chanting
with a high voice: ” (for Scripture and poetry
are usually chanted:) then, he read, or recited,
anything in any manner, without, or from, or in,
a book.] It is said in a trad., مَنْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يَقْرَأَ
القُرْآنَ غَضًّا كَمَا أُنْزِلَ فَلْيَقْرَأْهُ قِرَآءَةَ أُمِّ عَبْدٍ [He
who desires to read, or recite, the Kur-án freshly,
like as it was revealed, let him read, or recite, it
in the manner of Ibn-Umm-'Abd]; meaning فَلْيُرَنِّلْ
كَتَرْتِيلِهِ [properly, let him read, or recite, in a
leisurely manner, with distinct utterance, and with
moderation; but conventionally, let him chant,
in a peculiar, distinct, and leisurely, manner;
like as he did]: or يُحَزِّنْ كَتَحْزِينِهِ [let him read,
or recite, with a slender and plaintive voice, like
as he did]: or يَحْدُرْهُ كَحَدْرِهِ [let him read it, or
recite it, quickly, like as he did]. (O.) And in
a trad. of I'Ab, it is said, كَانَ لَا يَقْرَأُ فِى الظُّهْرِ
وَالعَصْرِ, meaning He used not to recite [the Kur-
án] aloud in the [prayers of the] noon and the
[period of the afternoon called the] عْصر: or he
used not to make himself to hear his reciting:
as though he heard persons reciting and making
themselves and those near them to hear. (TA.)
The saying, in the Kur [lxxv. 17 and 18], إِنَّ
عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ وَقُرْآنَهُ فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَاهُ فَاتَّبِع قُرْآنَهُ means
Verily on us is the collecting thereof [i. e. of the
Kur-án] and the reciting thereof; and when we
recite it, then follow thou the reciting thereof: or,
accord. to I'Ab, and when we explain it to thee,
then do thou according to that which we have explained to thee: (S, O, TA:) or the meaning
[signified and implied] is, verily on us is the collecting thereof in thy mind, and the fixing the
recitation thereof on thy tongue; and when we
recite it to thee by the tongue of Gabriel, then
follow thou the reciting thereof, and often recur
therein so that it may become firmly rooted in
thy understanding: (Bd:) [therefore قُرْآنَهُ in the
former instance means the teaching thee to recite
it; and thus we may explain the assertion that]
قَرَأَ and ↓ أَقْرَأَ are syn. in like manner as are عَلَا قِرْنَهُ
and استعلاهُ. (Sb, TA.) See 4. قَرَأَ عَلَيْهِ means
He read, or recited, to him the Kur-án, &c., [as
a teacher, or an informant; (as is shown by
phrases in the Kur xxvi. 199 and lxxxiv. 21;)
like تَلَا عَلَيْهِ: and also, as a conventional and
post-classical phrase,] as a pupil, or learner, to
his sheykh, or preceptor. (L.) قَرَأَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامَ
and السَّلَامَ ↓ أَقْرَأَهُ are syn., (S, O, Msb, K, TA,)
signifying He conveyed, or delivered, to him the
salutation: or the latter phrase is not used unless
the salutation is written: (K, TA:) or belongs
to a particular dial.; and is used when the salutation is written, meaning he made him to read the
salutation: (AHát, TA:) the aor. of the verb in
the former phrase is
قَرَاَ, and the inf. n. is قِرَآءَةٌ:
As says that the making that verb trans. by itself
is a mistake; therefore one should not say اِقْرَأْهُ
السَّلَامَ [meaning Convey thou, or deliver thou, to
him, salutation]. (Msb.) ―

قرّأت جَارِيَةً She kept at her abode a girl, or
young woman, until she should menstruate, in order
to find if she were free from pregnancy. (Aboo-
'Amr Ibn-El-'Alà, S, O.) And قِرّئَتْ She was
kept in confinement [for the purpose above mentioned, or] in order that the termination of her
menstruations might be waited for, or awaited,
(K,) or until the termination of her عِدَّة [q. v.].
(TA.)
3
قارأهُ, (O, K.) inf. n. مُقَارَأَةٌ and قِرَآءٌ, (K,)
He read, or studied, with him, each of them
teaching the other. (O, K.) ―
-b2-  It is said of the
[ch. of the Kur-án entitled] سُورَةُ الأَحْزَاب, as
Ibn-Háshim related that trad., إِنْ كَانَتْ لَتُقَارِئُ
سُورَةَ البَقَرَةِ هِىَ أَطْوَلُ i. e. [Verily (إِنْ being
here a contraction of إِنَّ as in the Kur xvii. 75
and 78 &c.)] it was equal as to the time required
to read it, or to recite it, to [that which is entitled]
the سورة of the بقرة [or it was longer]: but most
related it as commencing with the words ان كانت
لَتُوَازِى. (TA.)
4
اقرأت, said of a woman: see 1, former half.
Said of a she-camel, (K, TA,) and of a ewe, or
she-goat, (TA,) She retained the seed of the male
in her womb: (K, TA:) and when this is the
case, one says that she is فى قِرْوَتِهَا, which is
anomalous, for ↓ فى قِرْأَتِهَا; (TA in the present
art.;) meaning in the first period of her pregnancy,
before its becoming apparent, or manifest. (TA
in art. قرو.) [And accord. to Freytag, (app. in
the phrase أَقْرَأَتْ سَمًّا,) the verb is expl. in the
Kitáb el-Addád as said of a serpent, meaning
It retained poison for the space of a month.] ―
-b2-
Also, said of a woman, She menstruated: and
she became pure from the menstrual discharge:
(S, O, * Msb, K, TA:) and so ↓ قَرَأَتْ, in both
of these senses, (Msb, TA,) aor.
قَرَاَ, inf. n. قَرْءٌ;
(Msb;) or in the former sense; (Akh, S, K;)
and [accordingly] one says, قَرَأَتْ حَيْضَةً أَوْ حَيْضَتَيْنِ
[so in copies of the S, agreeably with what immediately precedes, but in one of my copies of the
S and in the O and TA, أَقْرَأَت, meaning, she
menstruated once or twice]; (S, O, * TA; *) and
قَرَأَتْ signifies she saw the blood [of the menses app.
for the first time]: (TA:) and أَقْرَأَتْ signifies
she became one who had the menstrual discharge.
(Akh, S, O, TA.) [Accord. to Zj, as I gather
from the TA, the second of the significations in
the sentence immediately preceding is from the
collection of the blood in the womb: in the
opinion of IAth, it and the first signification are
from relation to time: but I rather incline to
think that the converse of this is the case, and
that hence are deduced several other meanings
here following.] ―
-b3-  اقرأت الرِّيَاحُ (S, K) The
winds blew, (K,) or began [to blow], (S,) in their
time, or season. (S, K.) ―
-b4-  اقرأ (said of a man,
O, TA) He reverted, or turned back, (O, K, TA,)
from his journey. (O, TA.) And He returned
(K, TA) from his journey. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And He,
or it, approached, or drew near. (K.) You say,
أَقْرَأْتُ مِنْ أَهْلِى I approached, or drew near to,
my family. (O.) And أَقْرَأَتْ حَاجَتُكَ They object
of want approached, or drew near; or has approached, &c. (S, O.) ―
-b6-  And It set, (K, TA,)
said of a star: or the time of its setting came, or
drew near. (TA.) أَقْرَأَتِ النُّجُومُ signifies The
stars set: (O:) ―
-b7-  and also (O) The stars delayed
[to bring] their rain. (S, O.) ―
-b8-  And اقرأ is also
syn. with أَخَّرَ, (K, TA,) in the phrase اقرأ حَاجَتَهُ
[He postponed, or delayed, the object of his want:]
(TA:) and, (K, TA,) as some say, (TA,) syn.
with اِسْتَأْخَرَ [He, or it, was, or became, behind,
backward, late, &c.:] (K, TA:) [but it should
be observed that أَخَّرَ is often intrans., and syn.
with اِسْتَأْخَرَ; therefore one signification may
possibly in this instance be meant by both: such,
however, is not the case accord. to SM, as has
been shown above, and as is further shown by his
saying,] perhaps the saying of the author of the
K, that it is syn. with أَخَّرَ, may have been taken
from the phrase أَعَتَّمْتَ قِرَاكَ أَمْ أَقْرَأْتَهُ i. e. Hast
thou withheld thy entertainment for the guest, or
guests, or hast thou postponed it? but his explanation is obviously loose and defective. (TA.) ―
-b9-
أَقْرَأْتُ فِى الشِّعْرِ is from الأَقْرَآءُ [pl. of القَرْءُ or القُرْءُ:
hence it seems to mean I rhymed, or versified:
compare أَرْجَزَ from الرَّجَزُ, and أَرْمَلَ from الرَّمَلُ,
&c.]. (O. [See also 8.])
-A2-  أَقْرَأهُ, (L, K, TA,)
inf. n. إِقْرَآءٌ, (TA,) He (a sheykh, or preceptor,
L, TA) made him, or taught him, to read, or
recite; (L, K, TA;) [and so ↓ قَرَأَهُ, inf. n. قُرْآنٌ,
as shown before:] see 1, last quarter. One says,
أَقْرَأَهُ القُرْآنَ (S, O, L, TA) and الحَدِيثَ (L, TA)
He made him, or taught him, to read, or recite,
the Kur-án and the tradition. (L, TA.) Hence
أَقْرَأَهُ السَّلَامَ: (AHát, TA:) see 1, near the end.
―
-b2-  See also what next follows.
5
تقرّأ He devoted himself to religious exercises
[and particularly to the reading, or reciting, of
the Kur-án]; (S, K;) as also ↓ قَرَأَ; (O, TA;)
and ↓ اقرأ: (K, TA:) and i. q. تَفَقَّهَ [i. e. he
learned knowledge, or science; or particularly
الفِقْه, meaning the science of the law. (K.)
8
إِقْتَرَاَ see 1, former half. [After the mention of
اقترأهُ as syn. with قَرَأَهُ, it is added in the TA,
يقال اقترأت فى الشعر, in which اقترأت is
evidently a mistranscription; and not attributable
to the copyist, but to the author, of the TA, for
the whole sentence is misplaced.]
10
استقرأ الأَشْيَآءَ, (Msb,) or استقرى الاشياءَ,
(TA in art. قرو,) [both probably correct, as dial.
vars.,] He investigated the أَقْرَآء [or modes, or
manners of being, (pl. of ↓ قَرْءٌ or قُرْءٌ, and of قَرْوٌ,)]
of the things, for acquiring a knowledge of their
conditions and properties. (Msb in this art., and
TA in art. قرو.) [And one says also, استقرأ
الكتَابَ, meaning He investigated the book to find
some particular thing.] ―
-b2-  And استقرأ الجَمَلُ النَّاقَةَ
The he-camel left the she-camel (تَارَكَهَا [in the CK
and in my MS. copy of the K باركها]) in order
that he might see whether she had conceived or not:
(S, K:) [or whether she were in her state of
desire: for SM adds, after stating that this is
from AO,] as long as the وديق [i. e. وَدِيق, an
epithet which seems to be properly applied to a
female solid-hoofed animal, but here app. applied to
a she-camel,] is in her وديق [a mistranscription for
وِدَاق or a noun cognate there with], one says of
her, ↓ هِىَ فِى قُرْئِهَا and أَقْرَائِهَا. (TA. [See also 1,
first quarter; and see قَرْءُ الفَرَسِ.]) ―
-b3-  And استقرأهُ
signifies He desired, or demanded, of him that he
should read, or recite. (MA, TA.)
قَرْءٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, &c.) and ↓ قُرْءٌ, (Mgh,
Msb, K,) or the latter is a simple subst. and the
former is an inf. n., (Msb,) A menstruation: and
a state of purity from the menstrual discharge:
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, &c.:) thus having two
contr. meanings: (S, O, K:) said by IAth to
have the latter meaning accord. to Esh-Sháfi'ee
and the people of El-Hijáz, and the former meaning accord. to Aboo-Haneefeh and the people of
El-' Irák: (TA:) and a time; (AA, S, Mgh, O,
K;) and so ↓ قَارِئٌ; (S, Mgh, O;) as in the
sayings, هَبَّتِ الرِّيحُ لِقَرْئِهَا and ↓ لِقَارِئِهَا The wind
blew at its time; (Kt, Mgh;) and this is the
primary signification (IAth, Mgh, O) accord. to
AA [and some others]; (Mgh;) whence [accord.
to them] the first and second of the meanings
mentioned above: (Kt, S, IAth, Mgh, O:) and
قَرْءٌ signifies also the termination of a menstruation: and some say, the period between two
menstruations: (S:) accord. to Zj, it means the
collecting of the blood in the womb; which is only
in the case of becoming pure from menstruation:
(TA:) the pl. is أَقْرَآءٌ and قُرُوْءٌ and أَقْرُؤٌ, (S, O,
Msb, K,) the last of which [as also properly the
first] is a pl. of pauc.; (S, O, Msb;) or when
قَرْءٌ or ↓ قُرْءٌ has the first of the meanings assigned
to it above the pl. is أَقْرَآءٌ, and when it has the
second thereof the pl. is قُرُوْءٌ: (K:) respecting
the phrase ثَلٰثَةَ قُرُوْءٍ in the Kur [ii. 228], As says,
it should by rule be ثَلٰثَةَ أَقْرُؤٍ: (Msb, TA:) the
grammarians say that it is for ثَلٰثَةً مِنَ القُرُوْءِ;
thus in the L: (TA:) or they say that it is for
ثَلٰثَةَ أَقْرُؤٍ مِنَ القُرُوْءِ: but some of them say that it
is allowable to use a pl. of mult. in relation to
three and more as far as ten [inclusively] without
[the necessity of] rendering the phrase otherwise
in grammatical analysis. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
A rhyme: (Z, K, TA:) أَقْرَآءٌ (Z, O, TA) and
قُرُوْءٌ (O) signifying the rhymes of verses; (Z, O,
TA;) which terminate like as do the اقرآء of the
states of purity from menstruation; (Z, TA;)
[i. e., they are thus called] because they terminate,
and limit, the verses: (O:) and أَقْرَآءُ الشِّعْرِ signifies
also the several modes, or manners. or species,
(IAth, O, K, TA,) and metres, (IAth, TA,) and
scopes, (K, * TA,) of verse, or poetry: (IAth,
O, K, TA:) the sing. is قَرْءٌ (O, TA) and ↓ قُرْءٌ,
and some say ↓ قِرْءٌ also, and ↓ قَرِىْ and قَرِىٌّ, and
some say that it is قَرْوٌ [q. v.] with و: and the pl.
of قَرِىٌّ is [also] أَقْرِيَةٌ [a pl. of pauc.]. (TA.)
One says, هٰذَا الشِّعْرُ عَلَى قَرْءِ هٰذَا الشِّعْرِ i. e. This
poetry is according to the mode, or manner, &c.,
of this poetry. (O.) See also 10, first sentence. ―

And قُرْءُ الفَرَسِ means The days of the mare's
desiring the stallion: or, of her being covered: one
says هِىَ فِى قَرْئِهَا and فِى أَقْرَائِهَا [She is in her
days of desiring &c.]. (TA.) See also 1, first

places.
قِرْءٌ: see قَرْءٌ, last quarter: ―

paragraph here following.
قِرْأَةٌ The وَبَآء [by which is here meant the
common, or general, disease] (As, S, O, K) of a
country; (S, O;) of which it is said that when a
person has come to that country and remained in
it fifteen nights [or days, accord. to one of my
copies of the S,] the قرأة thereof quits him; or, as
the people of El-Hijáz say, its قِرَة; meaning that
if he be affected with a malady after that, it will
not be from the وبآء [or قرأة] of the country: (As,
S, O;) and it is also termed ↓ قِرْءٌ. (TA. [But
I think it not improbable that this last word may
have originated in a mistranscription of قِرَةٌ.])
-A2-
See also 4, second sentence.
القُرْآنُ is said by some of the erudite to be
originally an inf. n. of قَرَأْتُ الشَّىْءَ meaning “ I
collected together the thing,” or of قَرَأْتُ الكِتَابَ
meaning “ I read, or recited, the book, or Scripture; ” and then conventionally applied to signify
The Book of God that was revealed to Mo-
hammad: (Kull:) it is [also expl. as signifying]
the revelation, (K, TA,) meaning that which is
termed العَزِيز [the mighty, or inimitable, &c.],
which is read, or recited, and written in books, or
volumes: (TA:) used as a subst., and unrestrictedly, it is applied in the language of the law
to the substance itself [whereof the Kur-án consists], and lexically to the alphabetical letters [in
which it is written] for these are what are read;
as when one says, كَتَبْتُ القُرْآنَ [I wrote the
Kur-án], and مَسِسْتُهُ [I touched it]: (Msb:) [and
without the article ال, it is applied to any portion
of the Kur-án:] accord. to AO, (S,) and Zj,
(TA,) it is thus called because it collects and
comprises the سُوَر [or chapters]: (S, O, TA:)
and IAth says that the original meaning of the
word is the collection; and that the قُرْآن is so
called because it has collected the histories [of the
prophets &c.], and commands and prohibitions,
and promises and threats, [and the like is said in
the O,] and the آيَات [i. e. verses, or signs], and
the سُوَر [or chapters]: but Ismá'eel Ibn-Kustan-
teen, to whom, as a disciple to his preceptor, EshSháfi'ee read, or recited, the Kur-án, is related on
the latter's authority to have said that القُرَانُ is a
subst., and with hemz, and not taken from قَرَأْتُ, but
is a name for the Book of God, like التَّوْرَاةُ [the
Book of the Law revealed to Moses] and الإِنْجِيلُ
[the Gospel]: and it is related that Aboo-'Amr
Ibn-El-'Alà used to pronounce القران without
hemz [like many others, but it is, and always has
been, pronounced by most with hemz]. (TA.)
―
-b2-  It is also applied to The divinely appointed
act of prayer (الصَّلَاةُ) because it comprises recitation [of words of the Kur-án]. (IAth, TA.)
قَرِىْءٌ: see قَرْءٌ, last quarter.
قَرَّاءٌ A good reader or reciter [of the Kur-án]:
pl. قَرَّاؤُونَ: it has no broken pl. (K, TA.)

and to a woman, (Fr, TA,) and ↓ قَارِئٌ and
↓ مُتَقَرِّئٌ, (K,) A devotee; or one who devotes
himself [and in the case of the first of these
epithets herself] to religious exercises [and particularly to the reading, or reciting, of the
Kur-án]: (S, O, K:) pl. قُرَّاؤُونَ (S, K) and
قَرَارِىْءُ, (K, TA,) [in the CK قَرارِئُ and] in a
MS copy of the K قَوَارِئُ, which might be a pl. of
قَارِئٌ; and in the L قَرَائِئُ. (TA.) And قُرَّآءُ is
sometimes a pl. of قَارِئٌ. (S.)
قَارِئٌ as an epithet applied to a she-camel; pl.
قَوَارِئُ: see 1, former half.
-A2-  Also Reading, or
reciting, the Kur-án [&c.]; or a reader, or
reciter, thereof: (K, TA:) and sometimes the ء
is suppressed, so that one says قَارٍ: (TA:) pl.
قَرَأَةٌ and قُرَّآءٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and قَارِئُونَ. (Msb,

-A5-  It is also said to signify
The top, or upper part, of a قَصْر [or pavilion,
&c.]. (O.)
أَقْرَؤُكُمْ, occurring in a trad., may mean He,
of you, who reads, or recites, [the Kur-án] most:
or it may mean, who is most sound in his knowledge of the Kur-án, and who retains it most in
his memory. (Ibn-Ketheer, TA.)

latter word allowed by Ks and Fr, (TA,) and
