قَسْوَرٌ (S, TA) and قَسْوَرَةٌ, (K, TA,) the former
a coll. gen. n., and the latter the n. un., (M,) A
certain plant, (S, M, K,) which grows in plain,
or soft, land; (M, K;) a sour plant, of the kind
called نَجِيل, which is like the جُمَّة [or full and
long hair of the head] of a man, and becomes tall
and large, of which camels are greedily fond,
(AHn, M,) and which fattens them, and makes
them plentiful in milk. (Az, TA.) Lth is in
error in saying that the former signifies a huntsman, or hunter; for it signifies a plant, as IAar
and AHn and others have said.
-A2-  See also
قَسْوَرَةٌ, in two places.
قَسْوَرَةٌ Mighty; (M, K;) that overpowers, or
subdues, others: (M, TA:) also strong; applied
to a man: and courageous: (TA:) pl. قَسَاوِرُ.
(M.) ―
-b2-  A lion; as also ↓ قَسْوَرٌ: (S, M, K:) because he overcomes and overpowers. (TA.)
So in the Kur, [lxxiv. 51,] كَأَتَّهُمْ حُمُرٌ مُسْتَنْفِرَةٌ
فَرَّتْ مِنْ قَسْوَرَةٍ [As though they were asses taking
fright and running away at random that have
fled from a lion]. (S, M.) Or it has here the
signification next following. (S.) ―
-b3-  Hunters
that shoot, or cast: (S, K:) sing. ↓ قَسْوَرٌ; (K;)
accord. to Lth.; [and in the M it is said that
↓ قَسْوَرٌ signifies a shooter, or caster: or, accord. to
some, a hunter:] but this is a mistake; for قسورة
is a coll. n., having no sing.; and Fr says, that
in the verse of the Kur cited above, it means
shooters, or casters of missile weapons: it is also
related of 'Ikrimeh, that it was said to him that
قسورة signifies, in the Abyssinian language, a
lion; but he said that is signification is that
given above on the authority of Fr, and that the
lion in the Abyssinian language is called عَنْبَسَة:
and Ibn-'Arafeh says قسورة is of the measure
فَعْوَلَةٌ from القَسْرُ; and that the meaning [in the
Kur] is, as though they were asses made to take
fright and run away by shooting or hunting &c.
(TA.) Or, accord. to I'Ab, in the passage
above cited, it has the signification here next
following. (IKt, TA.)
-A2-  The sound of men,
(IKt, K, TA,) and their voices, or cries. (IKt,
TA.)
قَوْسَرَةٌ and قَوْسَرَّةٌ dial. forms of قَوْصَرَةٌ and
قَوْصَرَّةٌ, which see. (M, K.)
