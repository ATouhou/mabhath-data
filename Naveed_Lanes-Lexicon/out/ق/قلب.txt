قلب1
قَلَبَهُ, (S, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) aor.
قَلِبَ,
(Msb, K.) inf. n. قَلْبٌ, (Msb,) He altered, or
changed, its, or his, mode, or manner, of being;
(A, Mgh, Msb, * K;) and ↓ قلّبهُ signifies the
same, (K,) or is like قَلَبَهُ in the sense expl.
above and in other senses but denotes intensiveness
and muchness; (Msb;) and ↓ اقلبهُ also signifies
the same as قَلَبَهُ in the sense expl. above, (K,) on
the authority of Lh, but is of weak authority.
(TA.) Hence, (Mgh,) He inverted it; turned it
upside-down; turned it so as to make its upper most
part its undermost; (S, * A, * Mgh, Msb;) namely,
a thing; (S;) for instance, a [garment of the kind
called] رِدَآء: (A, * Mgh:) and ↓ قلّبهُ has a similar
meaning, but [properly] denotes intensiveness and
muchness. (Msb. See two exs. of the latter
verb voce قَلَبَةٌ.) And, (A, K,) like ↓ قلّبهُ,
[except that the latter properly denotes intensiveness and muchness,] (K,) it signifies حَوَّلَهُ ظَهْرًا
لِبَطْنٍ (A, K) [He turned it over, or upsidedown as meaning so that the upper side became
the under side; lit. back for belly; accord. to the
TA, meaning back upon belly (ظَهْرًا عَلَى بَطْنٍ);
but this is hardly conceivable; whereas the former
explanation is obviously right in another case:
(see 5:) and another meaning of قَلَبَهُ and ↓ قُلبهُ,
i. e. he turned it inside-out, is indicated in the TA by
its being added, so that he knew what was in it].
―
-b2-  See an ex. voce قَلَابِ. One says, قَلَبَ كَلَامًا
[meaning He altered, or changed, the order of
the words of a sentence or the like, by inversion,
or by any transposition]. (TA.) [And in like
manner, قَلَبَ كَلِمَةً He altered, or changed, the
order of the letters of a word, by inversion, or by any
transposition.] Es-Sakháwee says, in the Expos.
of the Mufassal, that when they transpose [the
letters of a word], they do not assign to the [transformed] derivative an inf. n., lest it should be confounded with the original, using only the inf. n.
of the original that it may be an evidence of the
originality [of the application of the latter to denote
the signification common to both]: thus they say
يَئِسَ, inf. n. يَأْسٌ; and أَيِسَ is مِنْهُ ↓ مَقْلُوبٌ [i. e.
formed by transposition, or metathesis, from it],
and has no inf. n.: when the two inf. ns. exist,
the grammarians decide that each of the two
verbs is [to be regarded as] an original, and that
neither is مقلوب from the other, as in the case of
جَذَبَ and جَبَذَ: but the lexicologists [in general] assert that all such are [of the class termed]
مقلوب. (Mz, close of the 33rd نوع.) [And
قَلَبَ likewise signifies He changed, or converted,
a letter into another letter; the verb in this sense
being doubly trans.: for ex., one says, قَلَبَ الوَاوَ
يَآءً He changed, or converted, the و into ى.] ―
-b3-
And [hence] one says, قَلَبَهُ عَنْ وَجْهِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He
turned him [from his manner, way, or course, of
acting, or proceeding, &c.]: and Lh has mentioned ↓ اقلبهُ [in the same sense], but as being
disapproved. (TA.) And قَلَبَ الصِّبْيَانَ (tropical:)  He
(the teacher) turned away [or dismissed] the boys
to their dwellings: (Th, A, TA:) or sent them
[away], and returned them, to their abodes: and
Lh has mentioned ↓ اقلبهم as a dial. var. of weak
authority, saying that the former verb is that
which is used by the Arabs in this and other
[similar] cases. (TA.) And قَلَبْتُ القَوْمَ (assumed tropical:)  I
turned away [or dismissed] the people, or party;
(Th, S, O;) like as you say صَرَفْتُ الصِّبْيَانَ.
(Th, S.) And قَلَبَ اللّٰهُ فُلَانًا إِلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  [God translated such a one unto Himself, by death: meaning God took his soul]; as also ↓ اقلبه; (K,
TA;) whence the saying of Anooshirwán,
اللّٰهُ مُقْلَبَ أَوْلِيَائِهِ ↓ أَقْلَبَكُمُ (assumed tropical:)  [May God translate
you with the translating of his favourites (مقلب
being here an inf. n.), meaning, as He translates
his favourites]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And قَلَبَ عَيْنَهُ, and
حِمْلَاقَهُ, (TA,) or حِمْلَاقَ عَيْنِهِ, (A,) [He turned
about, or rolled, his eye, and therefore the parts
of his eye that are occasionally covered by the eyelids,] on the occasion of anger, (A, TA,) and of
threatening. (TA.) ―
-b5-  قَلَبَ, aor.
قَلِبَ, inf. n.
قَلْبٌ; and ↓ اقلب likewise, but this is of weak
authority, mentioned by Lh; signify also He
turned over bread, and the like, when the upper
part thereof was thoroughly baked, in order
that the under side might become so. (TA.)
And you say, قَلَبْتُ الإِنَآءَ عَلَى رَأْسِهِ [I turned over
the vessel upon its head]. (Msb, in explanation
of كَبَبْتُ الإِنَآءَ.) And قَلَبْتُ الأَرْضَ لِلزِّرَاعَةِ [I
turned over the earth for sowing]: and ↓ قَلَّبْتُهَا,
also, I did so much.] (Msb.) And يُقْلَبُ التُّرَابُ
بِالحَفْرِ [The earth is turned over in digging]:
whence قَلَبْتُ قَلِيبًا means I dug a well. (A.) ―
-b6-
And [hence also] one says, قَلَبْتُ الشَّىْءَ لِلْاِبْتِيَاعِ
I turned over the thing, or (assumed tropical:)  I examined
the several parts, or portions, of the thing,
(تَصَفَّحْتُهُ,) [or I turned over the thing for the
purpose of examining it,] with a view to purchasing, and saw its outer part or side, and its inner
part or side: and ↓ قَلَّبْتُهُ, also, I did so much.
(Msb.) And قَلَبَ السِّلْعَةَ (tropical:)  He (a trafficker)
examined the commodity, and scrutinized its condition: and ↓ قَلَّبَهَا, also, he did so [much]. (A.)
And قَلَبَ الدَّابَّةَ and الغُلَامَ (tropical:)  [He examined, &c.,
the beast, or horse, or the like, and the youth, or
young man, or male slave]: (A:) and قَلَبَ
المَمْلُوكَ, aor.
قَلِبَ, inf. n. قَلْبٌ, (tropical:)  he uncovered and
examined the male slave, to look at [or to see] his
defects, on the occasion of purchasing. (O, TA.)
And قَلَبْتُ الأَمْرَ ظَهْرًا لِبَطْنٍ (assumed tropical:)  I considered [or
turned over in my mind] what might be the issues,
or results, of the affair, or case: and ↓ قَلَّبْتُهُ,
also, I did so much. (Msb.)
-A2-  قَلَبٌ signifies
اِنْقِلابٌ, (S, A, O, K, TA,) meaning A turning
outward, (TK,) and being flabby, (TA,) of
the lip, (S, A, O, K,) or of the upper lip, (TA,)
of a man: (S, A, O, K, TA:) it is the inf. n. of
قَلِبَت said of the lip (الشَّفَةُ); (TA;) [and also,
accord. to the TK, of قَلِبَ said of a man as
meaning His lip had what is termed قَلَبٌ:] and
hence ↓ أَقْلَبُ as an epithet applied to a man;
and [its fem.] ↓ قَلْبَآء as an epithet applied to a
lip. (S, A, O, K, TA.)
-A3-  قَلَبَهُ, (S, A, O, K,)
aor.
قَلُبَ (Lh, K) and
قَلِبَ, (K,) He (a man, S, O)
hit his heart. (S, A, O, K.) And It (a disease)
affected, or attacked, his heart. (A.) And
قُلِبَ He (a man) was affected, or attacked, by a
pain in his heart, (Fr, A, * TA,) from which one
hardly, or nowise, becomes free. (Fr, TA.) And
قُلِبَ said of a camel, (As, S, O, K, TA,) inf. n.
قُلَابٌ, (As, S, TA,) He was attacked by the
disease called قُلَاب expl. below: (As, S, O, K,
TA:) or he was attacked suddenly by the [pestilence termed] غُدَّة, and died in consequence.
(As, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] قَلَبَ النَّخْلَةَ (tropical:)  He plucked
out the قَلْب, or قُلْب, meaning heart, of the
palm-tree. (S, A, O, K.) ―
-b3-  And قَلَبَتِ البُسْرَةُ

قَلَّبَ see 1, first quarter, in four places. You
say, قَلَّبْتُهُ بِيَدِى [I turned it over and over with
my hand], inf. n. تَقْلِيبٌ. (S.) [And hence
several other significations mentioned above.]
See, again, 1, latter half, in four places. ―
-b2-
فَأَصْبَحَ يُقَلِّبُ كَفَّيْهِ, (A, O,) in the Kur [xviii. 40],
(O,) means فاصبح يقلّب كفّيه ظَهْرًا لِبَطْنٍ [And
he began to turn his hands upside-down, or to do
so repeatedly,] in grief, or regret: (Bd:) or (tropical:)  he
became in the state, or condition, of repenting, or
grieving: (Ksh, A, O:) for تَقْلِيبُ الكَفَّيْنِ is an
action of him who is repenting, or grieving;
(Ksh, O:) and therefore metonymically denotes
repentance, or grief, like عَضُّ الكَفِّ and السُّقُوطُ
فِى اليَدِ. (Ksh.) ―
-b3-  [تَقْلِيبُ المَالِ لِغَرَضِ الرِّبْحِ
occurs in the A, in art. تجر, as an explanation of
التِّجَارَةُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  The employing of property, or
turning it to use, in various ways, for the purpose of
gain.] And you say, قَلَّبْتُهُ فِى الأَمْرِ, meaning

way he pleased, according to his own judgment or
discretion or free will, or I made him a free
agent, in the affair: or I made him, or employed
him, to practise versatility, or to use art or artifice or cunning, in the affair: and simply, I
employed him in the managing of the affair]. (K

turned over and over, or revolved repeatedly, in

tropical, (A,) meaning (tropical:)  [And they turned over
and over in their minds affairs, meditating what

thee, and the rendering thy religion ineffectual]:

[more agreeably with the primary import of the
verb] they revolved ideas, or opinions, respecting

4
أَقْلَبَ see 1, in six places. [اقلبهُ, said of God,
also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He made him to return from a
journey: see an ex. in the first paragraph of art.
صحب. (In the phrase أَقْبِلْنَا بِذِمَّةٍ, expl. in the

family in safety, أَقْبِلْنَا is a mistranscription for
أَقْلِبْنَا.)]

5
تقلّب الشَّىْءُ ظَهْرًا لبِطْنٍ [The thing turned
over and over, or upside-down as meaning so that
the upper side became the under side, (lit. back
for belly,) doing so much, or repeatedly], like as
does the serpent upon the ground vehemently
heated by the sun. (S, O, TA.) تقلّب said of
a man's face [&c.] signifies تصرّف [i. e. It turned
about, properly meaning much, or in various
ways or directions; or it was, or became, turned
about, &c.]. (Jel in ii. 139.) And تَتَقَلَّبُ فِيهِ

In which the hearts and the eyes shall be in a
state of commotion, or agitation, by reason of

And فِى تَقَلُّبِهِمْ, in the Kur xvi. 48, means (assumed tropical:)  In
their journeyings for traffic. (Jel. [See also

journeying, for traffic or otherwise, in the country,
and in the disposal, or management, of affairs:
or تقلّب فى الامور means he practised versatility,

or management, of affairs]. (K, * TA.) And
هُوَ يَتَقَلَّبُ فِى أَعْمَالِ السُّلْطَانِ (tropical:)  He acts as he
pleases, &c., or simply he employs himself, in the
offices of administration, or in the provinces, of

انقلب, of which مُنْقَلَبٌ is an inf. n., (S, O,
K, TA,) syn. with اِنقِلَابٌ, (TA,) and also a n.
of place, (S, O, K, TA,) like مُنْصَرَفٌ, (S, O,
TA,) is quasi-pass. of قَلَبْتُهُ: (S, O:) it signifies
It, or he, was, or became, altered, or changed,
from its, or his, mode, or manner, of being:
(TA:) [and hence,] it (a thing) became inverted, or turned upside-down [&c.: see 1]. (S.)
―
-b2-  And [hence] الاِنْقِلَابُ إِلَى اللّٰهِ means (assumed tropical:)  The
transition, and the being translated, or removed,
to God, by death: and [in like manner] المُنْقَلَبُ
means the transition [&c.], of men, to the final
abode. (TA. [See an ex. in p. 132, sec. col.,
from the Kur xxvi. last verse.]) ―
-b3-  And الاِنْقِلَابُ
means also (assumed tropical:)  The returning, in an absolute sense:
and, as also المُنْقَلَبُ, particularly, from a
journey, and to one's home: thus, in a trad., in
the prayer relating to journeying, أُعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ
كَآبَةِ المُنْقَلَبِ (assumed tropical:)  [I seek protection by Thee from
the being in an evil state in respect of the returning from my journeying to my home]; i. e., from
my returning to my dwelling and seeing what
may grieve me. (TA.) The saying in the
Kur xxii. 11 وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ فِتْنَةٌ انْقَلَبَ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ
means (assumed tropical:)  And if trial befall him, and [particularly
such as] disease in himself and his cattle, he returns [to his former way, i. e., in this case,] to
infidelity. (Jel. [See also other exs. in the
Kur in ii. 138 and iii. 138.]) And one says,
انقلب عَنِ العَهْدِ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  He withdrew, or
receded, from the covenant, compact, agreement,
or engagement]. (S in art. حول.) [See also an
ex. from the Kur-án (lxvii. 4) voce خَاسِئٌ.]
قَلْبٌ The heart; syn. فُؤَادٌ: (Lh, T, S, M, O,
Msb, K, &c.:) or [accord. to some] it has a more
special signification than the latter word: (O,
K:) [for] some say that فؤاد signifies the “ appendages of the مَرِىْء [or œsophagus], consisting
of the liver and lungs and قَلْب [or heart]: ” (K
in art. فأد:) [and, agreeably with this assertion,]
it is said that the قلب is a lump of flesh, pertaining to the فؤاد, suspended to the نِيَاط [q. v.]: Az
says, I have observed that some of the Arabs
call the whole flesh of the قلب, its fat, and its
حِجَاب [or septum?], قَلْب and فُؤَاد; and I have
not observed them to distinguish between the
two [words]; but I do not deny that the [word]
قلب may be [applied by some to] the black clot
of blood in its interior: MF mentions that فؤاد
is said to signify the “ receptacle,” or “ covering,” of the heart, (وِعَآءُ القَلْبِ, or غِشَاؤُهُ, [i. e. the
pericardium,]) or, accord. to some, its “ interior: ”
the قَلْب is said to be so called from its تَقَلُّب:
[see 5:] the word is of the masc. gender: and the
pl. is قُلُوبٌ. (TA.) بَنَاتُ القَلْبِ means (assumed tropical:)  The
several parts, or portions, [or, perhaps, appertenances,] of the heart. (TA in art. بنى.)
[And قَلْبٌ is also used as meaning The stomach,
which is often thus termed in the present day:
so, for ex., in an explanation of طَنِخ, q. v.] ―
-b2-
قَلْبُ العَقْرَبِ (also called simply, القَلْبُ, Kzw) is
(assumed tropical:)  A certain bright star, [the star a in Scorpio,]
between two other stars, which is one of the Mansions of the Moon, (S, O,) namely, the Eighteenth
Mansion; so called because it is in the heart of
Scorpio: (MF:) [it rose aurorally, about the
commencement of the era of the Flight, in
Central Arabia, together with النَّسْرُ الوَقِعُ (a
of Libra) on the 25th of November, O. S.: (see
مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل:)] the commencement of
the period when the cattle breed in the desert is
at the time of its [auroral] rising and the
[auroral] rising of النسر الواقع; these two stars
rising together, in the cold season: the Arabs
say, القَلبْ جَآءَ الشِّتَآءُ كَالْكَلْبْ [When the
heart of the Scorpion rises, the winter comes like
the dog]: and they regard its نَوْء [q. v.] as unlucky; and dislike journeying when the moon is
in Scorpio: at its نَوْء [meaning auroral rising],
the cold becomes vehement, cold winds blow,
and the sap becomes stagnant in the trees: its
رَقِيب is الدَّبَرَانُ [q. v.] (Kzw.) There are also
three similar appellations of other stars: these
are قَلْبُ الأَسَدِ (assumed tropical:)  [Cor Leonis, or Regulus, the
star a of Leo]: قَلْبُ الثَّوْرِ, an [improper] appellation of الدَّبَرَانُ: and قَلْبُ الحُوتِ, a name of
الرِّشَآءُ [q. v.]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And القَلْبُ is syn. with
الضَّمِيرُ [signifying (assumed tropical:)  The heart as meaning the
mind or the secret thoughts]. (Msb in art. ضمر.)
―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  The soul. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  The mind,
meaning the intellect, or intelligence. (Fr, S, O,
Msb, K.) So in the Kur l. 36: (Fr, S, O,
TA:) or it means there endeavour to understand,
and consideration. (TA.) Accord. to Fr, you
may say, مَا لَكَ قَلْبٌ (assumed tropical:)  Thou hast no intellect, or
intelligence: (TA:) and مَا قَلْبُكَ مَعَكَ (assumed tropical:)  Thine intellect is not present with thee: (O, TA:) and
أَيْنَ ذَهَبَ قَلْبُكَ (assumed tropical:)  Whither has thine intellect gone?
(TA.) [And hence, أَفْعَالُ القُلُوبِ (assumed tropical:)  The verbs
significant of operations of the mind; as ظَنَّ,
and the like.] ―
-b6-  See also قُلْبٌ. ―
-b7-  [قَلْبُ الجَيْشِ
means (assumed tropical:)  The main body of the army; as distinguished from the van and the rear and the two
wings: mentioned in the S and K in art. خمس;
&c.] ―
-b8-  And قَلْبٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  The pure, or
choice, or best, part of anything. (L, K, * TA.) It is
said in a trad. إِنَّ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَلْبًا وَقَلْبُ القُرْآنِ يٰس
(tropical:)  [as though meaning, Verily to everything there
is a choice, or best, part; and the choice, or best,
part of the Kur-án is Yá-Seen (the Thirty-sixth
Chapter)]: (A, O, L, TA:) it is a saying of the
Prophet; [and may (perhaps better) be rendered,
verily to everything there is a pith; and the pith
&c.; from قَلْبٌ, as meaning, like قُلْبٌ, the
“ pith ” of the palm-tree; but,] accord. to Lth,
it is from what here immediately follows. (O.)
One says, جِئْتُكَ بِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ قَلْبًا, meaning (tropical:)  I have
come to thee with this affair unmixed with any
other thing. (A, * O, L, TA.) ―
-b9-  Also (tropical:)  A man
genuine, or pure, in respect of origin, or lineage;
(S, A, O, K;) holding a middle place among his
people; (A;) and ↓ قُلْبٌ signifies the same: (O,
K:) the former is used alike as masc. and fem.
and sing. and dual and pl.; but it is allowable to
form the fem. and dual and pl. from it: (S, O:)
one says عَرَبِىٌّ قَلْبٌ (S, A, * O) and ↓ قُلْبٌ (O)
(tropical:)  a genuine Arabian man, (S, A, * O,) and
اِمْرَأَةٌ قَلْبٌ (S, * A, O *) and قَلْبَةٌ (S, A, O) and
↓ قُلْبَةٌ (K) a woman genuine, or pure, in respect
of origin, or lineage: (S, A, * O, K:) Sb says,
they said هٰذَا عَرَبِىٌّ قَلْبٌ and قَلْبًا (assumed tropical:)  [This is an
Arabian genuine, or pure, &c., and being genuine,
or pure, &c.]; using the same word as an epithet
and as an inf. n.: and it is said in a trad., كَانَ
عَلىٌّ قُرَشِيًّا قَلْبًا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  'Alee was a Kurashee
genuine, or pure, in respect of race: or, as some
say, the meaning is, an intelligent manager of
affairs; from قَلْبٌ as used in the Kur l. 36.
(L, TA.)
قُلْبٌ (S, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and ↓ قَلْبٌ (S,
O, Msb, K) and ↓ قِلْبٌ (S, O, K) (tropical:)  The لُبّ, (S,
O,) or شَحْمَة, (A, K,) or جُمَّار, (Mgh, Msb,) [i. e.
heart, or pith,] of the palm-tree; (S, A, Mgh,
O, Msb, K;) which is a soft, white substance,
that is eaten; it is in the midst of its uppermost
part, and of a pleasant, or sweet, taste: (TA:
[see also جُمَّارٌ:]) or the best of the leaves of the
palm-tree, (AHn, K [in which this explanation
relates to all the three forms of the word, but app.
accord. to AHn it relates only to the first of
them], and TA,) and the whitest; which are the
leaves next to the uppermost part thereof; and one
of these is termed ↓ قُلْبَةٌ, with damm and sukoon:
(AHn, TA:) or قُلْبٌ, with damm, signifies the
branches of the palm-tree (سَعَف [in my copy of
the Msb سعفة]) that grow forth from the قلب
[meaning heart]: (T, TA: [see العَوَاهِنُ and
الخَوَافِى, pls. of عَاهِنٌ, or عَاهِنَةٌ, and خَافِيَةٌ:]) the
pl. is قِلَبَةٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) which is of the second,
(Msb,) [or of all,] and قُلُوبٌ, (Msb, K,) a pl. of
the second, (Msb,) and أَقْلَابٌ, (Msb, K,) a pl.
[of pauc.] of the first. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  And قُلْبٌ signifies also (tropical:)  A bracelet (S, O, K, TA) that is
worn by a woman, (K, TA,) such as is one قُلْب,
(S, O, TA, but in the O, one قَلْب,) [as though
meaning such as is single, not double,] or such as
is one قِلْد, ('Eyn, T, MS, [and this is evidently
the right reading, as will be shown by what
follows,]) meaning such as is formed by twisting
[or rather bending round] one طَاق [i. e. one wire
(more or less thick), likened to a yarn, or strand],
not of a double طَاق; (MS;) and they say سِوَارٌ
قُلْبٌ; (TA;) and قُلْبُ فِضَّةٍ i. e. a [woman's]
bracelet [of silver], (A, Mgh, Msb, TA,) such as
is not twisted [like a cord, or rope, of two or more
strands, as are many of the bracelets worn by
