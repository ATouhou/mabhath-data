قح1
قَحَّ, (L, K, TA,) [sec. pers., app., قَحُحْتَ,]
aor. يَقُحُّ, (L,) inf. n. قَحَاحَةٌ and قُحُوحَةٌ, He, or
it, was, or became, such as is termed قُحّ [i. e.
pure, sheer, mere, unmixed, unmingled, unadulterated, or genuine; said of, or in relation to,
meanness, sordidness, or ignobleness, and generosity, liberality, or nobleness, and anything].
(S, L, K.)
R. Q. 1
قَحْقَحَةٌ [an inf. n. of which the verb
is قَحْقَحَ] signifies The laughing of the ape or
monkey. (L, K.) [Compare with this قَهْقَهَةٌ.]
―
-b2-  And The voice's being, or becoming, reiterated
in the throat, or fauces. (L, K.) And it is
similar to بُحَّةٌ [which means A hoarseness, roughness, harshness, or gruffness, of the voice]. (L.)
[But both of these significations are also assigned
in the L to فَحْفَحَةٌ, with ف; to which alone, of
these two words, they may perhaps belong.]
قُحٌّ Pure, sheer, mere, unmixed, unmingled, unadulterated, or genuine; (As, S, A, K;) in, or in
respect of, (As, S, A,) or applied to, (K,) meanness, sordidness, or ignobleness, and generosity,
liberality, or nobleness, (As, S, A, K,) and anything: (K:) fem. قُحَّةٌ: and pl. أَقْحَاحٌ. (S, A.)
One says لَئِيمٌ قُحٌّ [One that is mean, sordid, or
ignoble,] in whom is nought of generosity, liberality,
or nobleness. (A.) And عَبْدٌ قُحٌّ A pure, or
mere, slave; one that is of purely servile condition;
(S;) or such as is termed قِنٌّ [which means the
same; or one born of slave-parents; &c.]. (A.)
And عَرَبِىٌّ قُحٌّ A pure, or genuine, Arabian; one
of pure Arabian race; fem. عَرَبِيَّةٌ قُحَّةٌ: (S, A,
TA:) as also كُحٌّ and كُحَّةٌ; in which the ك is
a substitute for the ق; for they said أَقْحَاحٌ, but
not أَكْحَاحٌ: [i. e. كُحُّ is not a dial. var. of قُحٌّ,
because the former has no pl.:] or أَكْحَاحٌ is
used as a pl. of كُحٌّ. (L in art. كح.) And
أَعْرَابِىٌّ قُحٌّ and ↓ قُحَاحٌ (K, TA) A pure, or
genuine, Arab of the desert: or one who has not
entered the towns, nor mixed with their inhabitants:
(TA:) pl. أَعْرَابٌ أَفْحَاحٌ. (S, TA.) And فُلَانٌ
مِنْ قُحِّ العَرَبِ (ISk, A, * TA) and كُحِّهِمْ, (ISk,
TA) Such a one is of the pure, or genuine, of the
Arabs. (ISk, A, * TA.) ―
-b2-  Also Coarse, rough,
or rude, in make, or in nature or disposition; applied to a man; (Lth, S, K;) as though he were
purely so; (S;) and to other than man. (Lth,
K.) ―
-b3-  And (hence, TA) Unripe, applied in this
sense to a melon, or water-melon, (Lth, A, K,
TA,) because of its dryness: (A:) or one in its
last state: but Az says that Lth has erred in explaining the word in the former of these senses,
and that the correct word is فِجٌّ. (TA.)
قُحَاحُ أَمْرٍ The root, foundation, origin, or
source, of a thing or an affair; its essence, or very
essence; or what is, or constitutes, its most essential, or elementary, part; the ultimate element to
which it can be reduced or resolved; its utmost
point or particular; or its principal, or best, part;
syn. أَصْلُهُ (Kr, L, K, TA) and فَصُّهُ (K, TA) and
خَالِصُهُ. (L, K, TA.) One says, صَارَ إِلَى قُحَاحِ
الأَمْرِ He reached, or arrived at, the root, &c., of
the affair. (L.) And لَقَد وَقَعْتُ بِقُحَاحِ قُرِّكَ, as
also وَقَعْتُ بِقُرِّكَ, I have become acquainted with
(عَلِمْتُ) all that thou knowest, nothing thereof
being hidden from me. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA.) And
لَأَضْطَرَّنَّكَ إِلى قُحَاحِكَ I will assuredly make thee
to have recourse to thine utmost effort, or endeavour,
i. e. إِلَى جَهْدِكَ: or, as IAar says, لا ضطرّنّك الى
تُرِّكَ وَقُحَاحِكَ, i. e. إِلَى أَصْلِكَ. (L. [See أَصْلٌ.])
―
-b2-  See also قُحٌّ, latter half.
قَحِيحٌ. [It is said in the K, القَحِيحُ فَوْقَ العَبِّ
وَالجَرْعِ: but it appears from a statement in the
TK that these words are a mistake copied from
the Moheet of Ibn-'Abbad, founded upon a mistranscription of القُحْقُحُ فَوْقَ القِبِّ. See what
next follows.]
قُحْقُحٌ [The ischium; i. e.] the bone that surrounds the posterior pudendum, (S, K,) somewhat
above the قِبّ [or end of the rump-bone]: (S:) or
the part where the two hip-bones meet, internally:
or [rather] what intervenes between the two hipbones, and surrounds the خَوْرَان [or anus, or part
in which is the anus]; the خوران being between
the قُحْقُح and the عُصْعُص: or the lower part of
the عَجْب [or rump-bone, or root of the tail], in
the integuments (طِبَاق) of the two hip-bones; somewhat above the قِبّ: or the bone upon which is
the place wherein the penis is inserted, next, or
near, to the lower part of the رَكَب [or pubes]: it
is said in the T that it is no part of the extremity
of the backbone, and that its place of junction, or
meeting, is outside the عُصْعُص: also, that the
upper part of the عُصْعُص is the عَجْب, and its
lower part is the ذَنَب: or the عصعص is the internal extremity of the backbone, and the عجب
is its external extremity, and the خَوْرَان is the دُبُر:
(L, TA:) or, accord. to IAar, i. q. عُصْعُصٌ. (O
voce عُكْدَةٌ.)
قَرَبٌ قَحْقَاحٌ and ↓ مُقَحْقِحٌ [A night's journey
to water] that is hard, or difficult. (K.)
مُقَحْقِحٌ: see what next precedes.
