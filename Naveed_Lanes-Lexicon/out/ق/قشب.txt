as above, He corrupted, or vitiated, it: (K, TA:)
or he mixed it (i. e. anything) with a thing that

(M,) He poisoned the food; (S;) he mixed the

unclean, or filthy: (O, K: [in the former القَشْبُ
is expl. by the words الاصابةُ بما يُكْرَهُ ويُسْتَقْذَرُ;
which, as well as what here follows, shows that
an assertion in the TK (copied from the TA, and
adopted by Freytag) respecting the explanation
in the K, is erroneous:]) and hence the saying of
'Omar, when he perceived the odour of perfume
from Mo'áwiyeh when the latter was a pilgrim,
مَنْ قَشَبَنَا [i. e. Who has affected us with what is
displeasing &c.?]; likening the odour of perfume

قَشْبٌ inf. n. of قَشَبَ [q. v.] ―
-b2-  [The explanations of this word by Golius and Freytag, by the
former as an epithet applied in two contr. senses
to a sword, and by the latter as a subst. (from a
misstatement in the TK mentioned above), are
erroneous.]

consisting of things mixed together; (Mgh;) as
also ↓ قَشَبٌ: (M, K:) pl. of the former أَقْشَابٌ.

(M, O, K,) resembling the مَقِر, (M, [which is
generally said to mean the aloe, and by AHn to
be a certain plant consisting of leaves without
branches, agreeably with what follows, in the O
and K resembling the مَفْد,]) from the middle
whereof there rises a stalk, which, when it grows
tall, bends down its top by reason of its succulence,
or suppleness; having upon its head a fruit (ثَمَرَةٌ,
M, O, [in the TA عقدة,]) with which birds of
prey are killed, (M, O,) being poisoned therewith
by its being put into flesh and thrown where they
alight: he who prepares it stops up his nose; if
he do not, it injures him; and people fear to
pasture their cattle near to the places of its growth
lest the animals should come in contact with it
and should break it or bruise it and it should exhale its odour upon them and kill them: thus
says AHn, on the authority of some one or more
of the Arabs of the desert, of the Saráh (السَّرَاة).

-b7-  Also, i. e. قِشْبٌ A man
in whom is no good; (K, TA;) and (TA) so
قِشْبٌ خِشْبٌ; (S, M, O, TA;) or this means with
whom is no good: the latter word is an imitative
sequent. (TA in art. خشب.) [See also قِشْبَةٌ.]
―
-b8-  And Dry, or tough, and hard. (M, TA.
[Like قَسْبٌ.])
-A2-  And القِشْبُ signifies The نَفْس
[here meaning جَسَد, i. e. body, as is shown
below, voce قَاشِبٌ]. (O, K.)
قَشَبٌ: see قِشْبٌ, in two places.
قَشِبٌ: see قَشِيبٌ.
قِشْبَةٌ A low, vile, ignoble, or mean, man, (IDrd,
M, O, K, TA,) possessing no good: (TA:) of the
dial. of El-Yemen. (IDrd, M, O, TA.) [See
also قِشْبٌ, last quarter.] ―
-b2-  And The young one
of the ape, or of the monkey: (M, O, K:) so,
IDrd says, some assert; (O;) but he doubted its
correctness; (M, O, TA;) and the right word is
قِشَّةٌ. (M, TA.)

and anything poisoned; as also ↓ مُقَشَّبٌ. (Nh,

↓ قَشِبٌ, (M,) New: (S, M, O, K:) ―
-b3-  and Old,
and worn-out: (M, O, K:) thus having two
contr. meanings: (O, K:) the former used alike
as masc. and fem.; applied to a garment; and
its pl. is قُشُبٌ [and by contraction قُشْبٌ,
mentioned by Golius on the authority of Meyd].
(M.) ―
-b4-  And the former, applied to a sword, (S,
O, K,) Polished: (K:) or recently polished: (S,
O:] ―
-b5-  and, (O, K,) so applied, (A, O, K,)
Rusty: (O, K:) or dirty: (A:) thus, again,
having two contr. meanings. (O, K)
قُشْبَانِيَّتَانِ (occurring in a trad., O) Two old
and worn-out [garments of the kind called]
burdehs (بُرْدَتَانِ): (O, K, TA:) or, as some say,
new: (Nh, TA:) the assertion that قُشْبَانٌ is a
pl. of قَشِيبٌ, and that قُشْبَانِيَّةٌ is a rel. n. from
this pl., is one upon which no reliance is to be
placed, (O, K,) for a rel. n. is not formed from a
pl. [unless from a pl. of the class of أَنْصَارٌ]: it is
an innovated form of rel. n. (O.)
قَاشِبٌ [act. part. n. of قَشَبَ; Mixing: &c.].
―
-b2-  One who imputes to others, or charges them
with, vices, or faults, that are in himself. (IAar,

النَّفْسِ); (K, TA;) i. e. (TA) one whose قِشْب
[meaning body] is weak, or emaciated; (O, TA;)
by his فِشْب being meant his نَفْس [as syn. with
جَسَد]. (O.)
مُقَشَّبٌ Poison with which medicaments [or
drugs] are mixed to render it potent. (Ham p.
331.) See also قَشِيبٌ, first sentence. ―
-b2-  And,
(M, K,) or مُقَشَّبُ الحَسَبِ, (S,) (tropical:)  A man whose
grounds of pretension to respect are mixed (S, M,
K, * TA) with ignobleness. (M, TA.)
