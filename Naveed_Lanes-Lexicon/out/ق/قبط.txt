قبط1
قَبَطَهُ, aor.
قَبِطَ, so in the margin of a copy of
the S, (TA,) inf. n. قَبْطٌ, (TS, O, K,) He collected it together, or comprehended it, with his
hand: (TS, O, K:) [like قَبَضَهُ:) in the TS
given as on the authority of IDrd: in the O as
on that of IF. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, inf. n. as above, He
mixed it. (TA.)

قَبَّطَ [قبّط وَجْهَهُ He contracted his face much;
made it much contracted, or very austere or
morose:] تَقْبِيطُ الوَجْهِ is syn. with تَقْبِيطُهُ; (Yaa-
koob, K;) and is formed from the latter by
transposition. (TA.)
القِبْطُ [The Copts; often called by themselves
القُبْطُ;] a certain people, or nation, in Egypt;
(TA;) the original, or genuine, people of Egypt;
(S, K, TA;) the Christians of Egypt: (Msb:)
n. un. ↓ قِبْطِىٌّ; (S, Msb, K;) fem. with ة: (Msb,
K:) you say إِمْرَأَةٌ قِبْطِيَّةٌ [A Copt woman]:
(Msb:) and جَمَاعَةٌ قِبْطِيَّةٌ and أَقْبَاطٌ [A company
of Copts; اقباط being a pl. of قِبْطٌ]. (TA.) [See
قُبْطِىٌّ.] Authors differ respecting their pedigree:
some say, that القِبْطُ was son of حَام [or Ham], son
of نُوح [or Noah]: the author of the Shejereh, that
مِصْرَائِيم [or Mizraïm] the son of حام left issue
from لُوذِيم [or Ludim], and that لوذيم are the
قِبْط of Egypt, in the Sa'eed: Aboo-Háshim
Ahmad Ibn-Jaafar El-'Abbásee, the genealogist,
says, that they are the children of قِبْط son of مِصْر
son of قُوط [a mistranscription for فُوط, the Phut
of the English Bible, A. V.,] son of حام: and this is
verified by Ibn-El-Joowánee the genealogist.
(TA.)
قُبْطِىٌّ A kind of thin, or fine, (Mgh, Msb,)
white, (Mgh,) cloth, (Mgh, Msb,) of linen, (Msb,)
made in Egypt; so called in relation to the قِبْط,
irregularly, to distinguish between it and the
man, who is called قِبْطِىٌّ: (Mgh, Msb:) so says
Lth, respecting these two forms: (TA:) you also
say, ↓ ثِيَابٌ قِبْطِيَّةٌ, with kesr; but when you convert the rel. n. into a subst, you say قُبْطِيَّةٌ, with
damm, to distinguish the subst. from the rel. n.
without ثياب; like as you say, رِمَاحٌ خَطِّيَّةٌ, and
خِطِّيَّةٌ, with kesr, when you do not mention the
رماح: so says Kh: (Msb in art. خط:) it is said
in the K, that القُبْطِيَّةُ, with damm, signifies a kind
of cloths, so called in relation to the قِبْط; and
sometimes it is with kesr; which is a plain assertion that the form with damm is the more
common: but in the S it is said, that القِبْطِيِّةُ
signifies certain white, thin, or fine, cloths, of
linen, made in Egypt; and sometimes it is with
damm, because they make a change in the rel. n.,
as in سُهْلِىٌّ and دُهْرِىٌّ, which (as SM adds) are
from سَهْلٌ and دَهْرٌ; and this indicates that the
regular form, with kesr, is the more common:
(TA:) the pl. is قَبَاطِىٌّ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and
قَبَاطِى: (K [but the latter, being indeterminate,
should be written قَبَاطٍ, like مَهَارٍ &c.:]) Sh says,
that the قَبَاطِىّ are a kind of cloths inclining to
fineness and thinness and whiteness. (TA.)
قِبْطِىٌّ and قِبْطِيَّةٌ: see القِبْطُ and قُبْطِىٌّ.
قُبَيْطَآءُ: see what next follows.
قُبَّاطٌ: see what next follows.
قُبَّيْطٌ: see what next follows.
قُبَّيْطَى and ↓ قُبَيْطَآءُ, the former with teshdeed
and with a short final alif, and the latter without
teshdeed and with a long final alif, (S, Msb, K, *)
and ↓ قُبَّيْطٌ and ↓ قُبَّاطٌ, (S, K,) i. q. نَاطِفٌ; (S,
Msb, K;) [described by Golius, on the authority
of an Arabic and Persian vocabulary, entitled
كتاب السامى فى الاسامى, as a very white kind
of sweetmeat, which consists of juice of grapes,
with an addition of other things, cooked so that it
becomes white and hard:] derived from قَبْطٌ signifying the act of “ collecting together. ” (TA.)
قُنَّبِيطٌ: see art. قنبط.
