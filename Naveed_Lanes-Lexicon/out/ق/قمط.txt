قِمْطٌ: see قِمَاطٌ, in two places.
قِمَاطٌ The thing, (S,) or wide piece of rag,
(Msb,) with which a child is bound (S, Msb) in
the cradle: (S:) or the piece of rag, (Mgh, K,)
or wide piece of rag, (TA,) which is wound upon

―

are bound (S, Mgh, K) on the occasion of the
slaughtering; (S, K;) as also ↓ قِمْطٌ: (K:) or
a rope with which the arms and legs, or hands and
feet, of a captive are bound together: (Msb, K:)
pl. as above; (Mgh;) and the pl. of قُمُطٌ [probably a mistranscription for قِمْطٌ] is أَقْمَاطٌ. (TA.)
―
-b3-  قُمُطٌ also signifies The شُرُط, (Mgh, Msb,)
meaning wide woven ropes, (Mgh,) of fibres or
leaves of the palm-tree, by which a booth of reeds
or canes is bound: or, as some say, the pieces of
wood that are upon the outside of a booth of reeds
or canes, or in its inside, to which are bound the
bundles of reeds or canes that form the roof:
(Mgh, Msb:) or the heads [or extremities] thereof:
(Msb:) or قمط, with damm, [app. meaning قُمُطٌ,
with damm to the second letter as well as the
first, or قُمْطٌ as a contraction of قُمُطٌ, like as
كُتْبٌ, accord. to some, is a contraction of كُتُبٌ,]
as IAth says, on the authority of Hr, (TA,) or
↓ قِمْطٌ, with kesr, (S, K,) signifies the thing, (S,)
or rope, (K, TA,) of fibres or leaves of the palmtree, (TA,) with which booths of reeds or canes

-b4-
Also قِمَاطٌ (assumed tropical:)  The snares by which one snares men:
and [its pl.] قُمُطٌ, accord. to the A, (tropical:)  the cords of
stratagems or tricks. (TA.) [Hence,] وَقَعْتُ
عَلَى قِمَاطِهِ (assumed tropical:)  I became acquainted with his stratagems, or tricks, (Lth, K,) or his snares by which
he snares men. (TA.) [The explanation of this
phrase by Lth is وقعت عَلى بُنُودِهِ: that in the K,
فَطِنْتُ بُنُودَهُ: another explanation is given in the
TA, which is, فَطِنْتُ لَهُ فى تُؤَدَةٍ: in the JK,
فَطَنْتُ بِتُؤَودَةٍ: the right reading in the K and JK
seems to be فَطِنْتُ بِبُنُودِهِ: and that of the explanation in the TA mentioned in this sentence is
most probably, I think, فَطِنْتُ لَهُ فِى بُنُودِهِ I
understood him in his stratagems, &c.]
قَمَّاطٌ A maker of قُمُط [pl. of قِمَاط] for children.
