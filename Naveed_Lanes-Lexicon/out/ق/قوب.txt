قوب1
قَابَ الأَرْضَ, aor. يَقُوبُهَا, (S, O,) inf. n. قَوْبٌ;
(K;) and ↓ قوّبها, (S, O,) inf. n. تَقْوِيبٌ; (S, O,
K;) He dug, or made a hollow in, the ground:
(K:) or he dug a round hollow in the ground;

(TA.) ―
-b2-  And قاب بَيْضَهُ, (S, O,) inf. n. as above,
(K,) It (a bird) broke asunder its eggs. (S, O, K.)
-A2-  قاب is also intrans., signifying جِلْدُهُ ↓ تقوّب
[app. His skin became pitted, or marked with
small hollows: see an explanation of 2, of which
تقوّب is quasi-pass.]. (O.) ―
-b2-  قابت البَيْضَةُ:
see 7.
-A3-  Also (قاب) He was, or became, near;
drew near; or approached: and He fled: (O, K,
TA:) inf. n. قَوْبٌ: (TA:) thus it has two contr.
significations. (K, TA.)
2
قَوَّبَ see above, first sentence. ―
-b2-  One says also,
قَوَّبْتُ الأَرْضَ meaning I made impressions, marks,
or traces, upon the ground, (O, K, TA,) by
treading; and made indications [thereby, or
thereof,] at its drinking-places. (TA.) And
قَوَّبوا الأَرْضَ, (A, TA,) or فِى الأَرْضِ, (O,) They
(i. e. persons alighting, A, TA) made impressions,
marks, or traces, upon the ground, (A, O, TA,)

قُوِّبَ مِنَ الغُبَارِ means اِغْبَرَّ [i. e., app., He, or it,
became sullied with dust]. (Th, TA.) ―
-b5-  And
قوّبهُ, inf. n. تَقْوِيبٌ, He pulled it out or up, by
the root; eradicated, or uprooted, it. (K, * TA.)
5
تقوّبت الأَرْضُ: see 7. ―
-b2-  تقوّب جِلْدُهُ:
see 1. ―
-b3-  تقوّب also signifies It became peeled,
or excoriated, or became so in several, or many,
places. (TA.) One says, تقوّب مِنْ رَأْسِهِ مَوَاضِعُ
Some places in his head became excoriated. (S.)
In the saying of Dhn-r-Rummeh,
تَقَوَّبَ عَنْ غِرْبَانِ أَوْرَاكِهَا الخَطْرُ
تَقَوَّبَ may be for ↓ قَوَّبَ [q. v.]: or the phrase
may be inverted, for تَقَوَّبَتْ غِرْبَانُهَا عَنِ الخَطْرِ.
(S in art. خطر. [See غُرَابٌ, in art. غرب.]) ―
-b4-  It
is also said of a place as meaning It became, in
parts, stripped of trees and herbage; and so
↓ انقاب. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And it signifies also It
was pulled out or up, by the root; was eradicated,
or uprooted. (S, O, K. *) ―
-b6-  تقوّبت البَيْضَةُ: see
the next paragraph.
7
اسقابت الأَرْضُ The ground was hollowed out
in a round form; (S, ISd, O, TA;) as also
↓ تقوّبت. (ISd, TA.) ―
-b2-  See also 5. ―
-b3-  انقابت
البَيْضَةُ, and ↓ تقوّبت, (S, A, O, K, TA,) and
↓ قَابَت, (TA,) The egg broke asunder, (S, A, O,
K, TA,) and disclosed the young bird within it.
(TA.) [Hence] one says اِنْقَابَتْ بِيْضَةُ بَنِى فُلَانٍ
عَنْ أَمْرِهِمْ [lit. The egg of the sons of such a one
broke asunder, and disclosed their affair, case, or
state]: meaning (tropical:)  the sons of such a one revealed,
or manifested, their affair, case, or state; a phrase
like أَفْرَخَتْ بَيْضَتُهُمْ. (A, TA.)
8
اقتابهُ He chose, made choice of, selected,
elected, or preferred, him, or it. (O, K.)
قَابٌ The portion, of a bow, that is between the
part that is grasped by the hand and the curved
extremity: to every bow there are قَابَانِ: (S,
O, Msb, K:) or, accord. to El-Khafájee, it is [the
space] between the string and the part that is
grasped by the hand, of the bow; as also ↓ قِيبٌ:
(TA:) in the Kur [liii. 9], فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ
accord. to some, is an inverted phrase, meaning
فكان قَابَىْ قَوْسٍ [i. e. And he was at the distance
of the measure of the two portions between the
part that is grasped by the hand and each of the
curved extremities of a bow]: (S, O:) [but] قَابٌ
signifies also a measure, or space; and so ↓ قِيبٌ:
(S, O, K:) one says, بَيْنَهُمَا قَابُ قَوْسٍ and
قَوْسٍ ↓ قِيبُ, [Between them two is the measure
of a bow], and likewise قَادُ قُوْسٍ and قِيدُ قَوْسٍ:
(S, O: *) and it is said that قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ [in the
case mentioned above] means at [the distance of] the
length of two bows: or as Fr says, at [the distance of]
the measure of two Arabian bows. (TA.) [قابُ
قَوْسٍ is also a term often used in astronomy to
denote the distance between two stars; and seems
to be syn. with ذِرَاعٌ (q. v.) as so used, thus meaning A cubit; which is the measure of each قاب
of a bow, or nearly so.]
قُوبٌ A young bird; (S, A, O, K;) as also
↓ قَائِبَةٌ and ↓ قَابَةٌ: (K:) or ↓ قَائِبَةٌ signifies, (S,
A, O,) or signifies also, (K,) an egg; (S, A, O,
K;) and so does ↓ قَابَةٌ: (K;) ↓ قَائِبَةٌ is used
in the latter sense as meaning ذَاتُ قُوبٍ, i. e.
ذَاتُ فَرْخٍ: (Az, * O, TA: *) or it is like رَاضِيَةٌ in
the phrase عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ [meaning مَرْضِيَّةٌ]: (A:)
[or as being originally the part. n. of قَابَت in the
phrase قَابَتِ البَيْضَةُ: and it may be used in the
former sense as being originally the act. part. n.
of قَابَت in the phrase قَابَتِ البَيْضَةَ said of a
hen-bird:] and ↓ قَاوِبَةٌ signifies an egg from
which the young bird has come forth: (Az, TA:) or
قُوبٌ signifies an egg: and ↓ قَابَةٌ, a young bird:
(AHeyth, TA:) the pl. of قُوبٌ is أَقْوَابٌ. (K.)
It is said in a prov., مِنْ قُوبٍ ↓ بَرِئَتْ قَائِبَةٌ, (S,
A, O,) or مِنْ قُوبٍ ↓ تَخَلَّصَتْ قَائَبِةٌ, (K,) or
مِنْ قُوبٍ ↓ قَابَةٌ, (tropical:)  An egg became or has become,
freed from a young bird [that was in it]: (S, A,
O, K:) or a young bird, from an egg: (AHeyth,
TA:) applied to him who has become separated
from his companion. (A, * K.) An Arab of the
desert, of the tribe of Asad, (S,) or Asd, (O,)
said to a merchant who asked him to be his safeguard, مِنْ ↓ إِذَا بَلَغْتُ بِكَ مَكَانَ كَذَا بَرِئَتْ قَائِبَةٌ
قُوبٍ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [When I shall have reached with
thee such a place,] I shall be clear of obligation
to protect thee. (S, O.) El-Kumeyt says
لَهُنَّ وَلِلْمَشِيبِ وَمَنْ عَلَاهُ
وَقُوبُ ↓ مِنَ الأَمْثَالِ قَائِبَةٌ
[To them (i. e. women), and to hoariness and him
upon whom it has come, relates, among the proverbs, “An egg and a young bird ”]: he likens
the fleeing of women from old men to the fleeing
of the قُوب, or young bird, from the قَائِبَة, or
egg; and [virtually] says that the beautiful
woman will not return to the old man, like as
the young bird will not return to the egg. (TA.)
And Aboo-'Alee El-Kálee mentions the saying,
مِنْ قُوبٍ ↓ لَا وَالَّذِى أَخْرَجَ قَائِبَةً, as meaning
[No, by Him who has produced] a young bird
from an egg: but Aboo-'Obeyd El-Bekree says
that this is inverted. (MF, TA.) ―
-b2-  أُمُّ قُوبٍ [in
the TA said to be بالفتح, a mistranscription
for بِالضَّمِّ,] Calamity, or misfortune. (O, K.)
قُوَبٌ [in the two phrases here following is
probably pl. of ↓ قُوبَةٌ]. You say, فِى الأَرْضِ قُوَبٌ
In the ground are hollows [app. meaning round
hollows: see 1, first sentence]. (A.) And فِى
رَأْسِهِ وَجِلْدِهِ قُوَبٌ In his head and his skin are
pits. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  And hence ↓ القُوَبَآءُ. (A.)
See قُوَبَآءُ, in two places. ―
-b3-  It signifies [also]
Egg-shells. (O, K.)
قِيبٌ: see قَابٌ, in three places.
قُابَةٌ: see قُوبٌ: in four places.
قُوبَةٌ: see قُوَبٌ: ―
-b2-  and see also قُوَبَآءُ, in three
places.
قُوَبَةٌ: see قُوَبَآءُ, in three places.
-A2-  Also, (K,)
applied to a man such as is termed مَلِىْءٌ [app. as
meaning “ rich,” or “ wealthy ”], One who remains
constantly in his abode, (S, K,) not quitting it.
(S.)
قُوَبَآءُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) fem., and imperfectly
decl., (S, O,) and قُوْبَآءٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) which is
masc., and perfectly decl., as quasi-coordinate to
قُرْطَاسٌ, said by ISk to be the only word of the
measure فُعْلَآءٌ except خُشَّآءٌ, (S, O,) both originally
of the measure فُعَلَآءُ, (O,) but to these may be
added مُزَّآءٌ, (S, O,) [and perhaps some other
instances,] and ↓ قُوَبَةٌ and ↓ قُوْبَةٌ, (O, K,) both
of which are said by Fr to signify the same as
قُوَيَآءُ, (O,) [Ringworm, or tetter; so called in the
present day;] a well-known disease, (S, O, Msb,)
characterized by excoriation and spreading, and
cured by spittle, (S, O, TA,) or by the spittle of
one who is fasting or hungry; (TA; [see an ex.
in a verse cited voce فِلْقٌ;]) a cutaneous eruption,
in which scabs peel off from the skin, and the hair
comes off: (K, TA:) see قُوَبٌ, above: ↓ قُوَبٌ is
[also] pl. of تُوَبَآءُ [like as نُفَسٌ is of نُفَسَآءُ], (S,)
[and] so is قَوَابِىُّ: (KL:) ISd says, accord. to
IAar, قُوَبَآءُ is sing. of ↓ قُوْبَةٌ and ↓ قُوَبَةٌ; but I
know not how this can be: and he [i. e. IAar]
also says that ↓ قُوَبٌ is pl. of ↓ قُوْبَةٌ and ↓ قُوَبَةٌ;
and this is clear. (TA.) The dim. of قُوَبَآءُ is
↓ قُوَيْبَآءُ; and that of قُوْبَآءٌ is ↓ قُوَيْبِىٌّ. (S, O.)
قُوبِىٌّ Fond of, or addicted to, the eating of
young birds, (O, K, TA,) which are termed أَقْوَاب
[pl. of قُوبٌ]. (TA.)
قُوَيْبَآءُ and قُوَيْبِىٌّ: see قُوَبَآءُ, concluding sentence.
قَائِبَةٌ and قَاوِبَةٌ: see قُوبٌ; the former in eight
places, and the latter in one place. قَائِبَةُ قُوبٍ
means An empty egg: to such, in a trad., Mekkeh
is likened when devoid of pilgrims. (O.)
أَرْضٌ مقوبةٌ [i. e. مَقُوبَةٌ or مُقَوَّبَةٌ, being written
without any syll. signs,] Land upon which rain
has fallen, and in consequence thereof, in some
places, trees that were in it formerly have been
carried away: mentioned by AHn. (TA.)
مُتَقَوِّبٌ Peeled, or excoriated; or so in several,
or many, places. (K.) ―
-b2-  And One from whose
skin scabs have peeled off, (A, K, TA,) leaving
upon it marks, (A,) and whose hair has come
off [at those places]. (K, TA.) ―
-b3-  And A
serpent (S, O, K) of the species termed أَسْوَدُ (S,
O) that has cast off its skin. (S, O, K.)
