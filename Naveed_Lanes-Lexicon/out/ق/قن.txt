قنقُنَّةٌ
An isolated mountain. (K, voce جَبَلٌ.)
See a verse cited in art. عز.
قِنَّةٌ
Galbanum: so in the present day: see
سَكْبِينَجٌ.
رَجُلٌ أُنَنَةٌ قُنَنَةٌ
: see art. ان. The last word
may perhaps be a mistranscription for فُنَنَةٌ (from
فَنُّ): but this I have not found in art. فن.
قِنِّيَّةٌ
The state, or condition, of slavery.
