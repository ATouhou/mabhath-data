قَرْثٌ A small [leathern vessel for water, of the
kind called] رَكْوَة: (O, K:) mentioned by Th,
on the authority of IAar: (O:) فَرْثٌ is a dial.
var. thereof; (TA;) [or] this latter, mentioned
by Az, in art. فرث, is a mistranscription. (O.)
قَرِيثَى: see قَرِيثَآءُ.
قَرَاثَآءُ: see what next follows, in four places.
بُسْرٌ قَرِيثَآءُ, (Ks, S, O, K,) with the lengthened
alif and without tenween, (Ks, S, O,) and
↓ قَرَاثَآءُ; (O, K;) and تَمْرٌ قَرِيثَآءُ and ↓ قَرَاثَآءُ:
(Lh, K:) and نَخْلٌ قَرِيثَآءُ (Ks, S, O, K) and
↓ قَرَاثَآءُ: (K:) قَرِيثَآء is [thus] used as an epithet,
and it is also used as the complement of a prefixed noun; [so that one says also بُسْرُ قَرِيثَآءَ, and
app. ↓ قَرَاثَآءَ likewise, and each in like manner
with تَمْرُ and with نَخْلُ prefixed;] and it is
dualized and is pluralized; and there is no word
like it in form, except كَرِيثَآء, in which the ك is
app. a substitute [for ق]; (ISd, L;) and which
is said by AZ to be syn. with قَرِيثَآء as applied to
بُسْر: (L:) [but كَثِيرَآءُ should be added as a word
of the same form; and perhaps there are other
instances:] and accord. to Abu-l-Jarráh, one
says ↓ تَمْرٌ قَرِيثَى, (S, O,) not with the lengthened
alif, (S,) i. e. with the shortened alif: (O:) the
meaning is, A species of dates, (S, K,) of (K) the
sweetest, or best, thereof, in the state in which
they are termed بُسْر; (S, O, * K;) a species of
dates, which are black, and of which the skin
quickly falls off from the لِحَآء [or flesh] thereof
when they become ripe; as AHn says, they are
the best of dates in the state in which they are
termed بُسْر; and he adds, the dried thereof are
black: (L, TA:) [and palm trees that produce
such dates:] some say that the word [قريثآء] is
أَعْجَمِىّ [i. e. foreign or Pers.]. (TA.)
قِرِّيثٌ A certain species of fish; (S;) a dial.
var. of جِرِّيثٌ [q. v.]. (S, K. *)
