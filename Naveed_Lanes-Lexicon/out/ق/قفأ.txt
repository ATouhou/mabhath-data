قفأ1
قَفِئَتِ الأَرْضُ, aor.
قَفَاَ, inf. n. قَفْءٌ, The land
was rained upon, and its herbage became altered
and spoiled thereby: (K:) or قَفْءٌ [the inf. n.]
signifies the falling of dust upon the herbs, or
leguminous plants, (AHn, K, TA,) in consequence
of which they are spoiled if the dust be not washed
off. (AHn, TA.) [See فَقَأَت as said of the
بُهْمَى.]

اقتفأ الخَرْزَ is said in the K to be syn. with
افتقأهُ, [q. v.,] and is expl. by Lh as meaning He
repeated the [kind of sewing termed] خَرْز [i. e. the
sewing of skins and the like by means of an awl],
and added, between the two kulbehs, another
kulbeh, as is done with reed-mats when they are
re-sewed. (TA.) [The kulbeh (كُلْبَة, q. v.) is
here described as a thong, or a strand (طَاقَة) of
[the membranous fibres that grow at the base of
the branches of the palm-tree and are called]
لِيف, used in the same manner as the shoemaker's
awl, &c., as in art. كلب, q. v.; but what is here
meant by this word is evidently, I think, a thong,
or the like, with which a skin is sewed, agreeably
with another explanation of it in art. كلب.]
