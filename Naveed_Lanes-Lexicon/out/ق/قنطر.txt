قنطرQ. 1
قَنْطَرَ الشّىْءِ i. q. عَقَدَهُ وَأَحْكَمَهُ [He tied,
or knit, the thing; or, agreeably with modern
usage, he arched, or vaulted, it; and made it
firm, or strong]. (Zj.) Hence what is called a
قَنْطَرَة is thus called because of its being firmly,
or strongly, knit together, or arched, or vaulted,
لِإِحْكَامِ عَقْدِهَا. (MF.) [It seems to signify He
compacted the thing. ―
-b2-  Also, He collected the
thing together into one aggregate; he aggregated
it. See the pass. part. n., below.]
-A2-  قَنْطَرَ He
(a man, TA) possessed property by the قِنْطَار:
(K:) or became possessed of a قنطار of property:
(TA:) or possessed large property, as though it
were weighed by the قنطار. (ISd, TA.)
