قسطسقُسْطَاسٌ and قِسْطَاسٌ A balance, or instrument
for weighing: (S, Msb, K; and Bd in xvii. 37:)
or the most even and most just kind thereof: or
such as is just, of whatever kind it be: (K:) or
i. q. قَبَّانٌ [a steelyard]: or, as Lth thinks, the
iron of the قبّان: or i. q. شَاهِينٌ [the beam of a
balance]: (TA:) or i. q. فَرَسْطُونٌ [an arabicized
Persian word, signifying a public standard of
weights or measures]: (Zj, TA:) also written
قصطاس: (K:) said to be Arabic, from القِسْطُ,
meaning “ justice: ” (Msb:) or a Greek word
arabicized; (IDrd, Msb, K;) and its being so
does not impugn the truth of the Kur-án's being
[altogether] Arabic; for when a foreign word is
used by the Arabs, and made by them conformable with their language in respect of
desinential syntax and determinateness and indeterminateness and the like, it becomes Arabic:
(Bd, ubi supra:) pl. قَسَاطِيسُ. (Msb.)
