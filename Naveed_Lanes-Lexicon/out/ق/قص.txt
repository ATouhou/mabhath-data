قَصَّهُ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) aor.
قَصُ3َ, inf. n. قَصٌّ,
(M, Msb,) He cut it; (S, Msb;) or he clipped
it, or shore it, or cut off from it; (A, K;)
namely, hair, (S, M, A, K,) and wool, (M,) and
plumage, (A,) and a nail of a finger or toe; (M,
K;) with the مِقَصّ, q. v.: (A, K:) as also
↓ قصّصهُ, (M, A,) and, by permutation, قَصَّاهُ: (M:)
or these two forms have an intensive signification:
or you say, الظُّفْرَ وَنَحْوَهُ ↓ قَصَّيْتُ, meaning, I
pared the nail and the like. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  Also,
He (a weaver) cut off from it, namely, a garment, or piece of cloth, its unwoven end, or
extremity, consisting of warp without woof. (M.)
―
-b3-  And He cut off the extremities of his ears.
(IAar, M.) قُصِّيهِ occurs in a trad., as meaning,
Take thou from the extremities of his ears. (TA.)
[But this may be from the root قصو, q. v.] ―
-b4-
And [hence,] قَصَّ اللّٰهُ خَطَايَاهُ (assumed tropical:)  God diminished,
or took or deducted from, [the account of] his
sins. (TA, from a trad.)
-A2-  قَصَّ أَثَرَهُ, (S, M,
A, Msb, K,) aor.
قَصُ3َ, (M, TA,) inf. n. قَصَصٌ, (S,
M, A, O, L, K,) in [some of] the copies of the
K قَصِيصٌ, but the former is the right, (TA,) and
قَصٌّ, (T, M, K,) He followed, or followed after,
his track, or footsteps, in pursuit; endeavoured to
trace him, or track him; (S, M, A, Msb, K,
&c.;) or he did so by degrees: (TA:) or by
night: or at any time: (M, TA:) which last is
the correct explanation: (TA:) and قَصَّهُ signifies
the same, (A, TA,) and so اثره ↓ اقتصّ, (S, K,)
and اثره ↓ تقصّص: (S, M, K:) and قَسَّ is a dial.
form of the same. (TA.) You say, خَرَجَ فُلَانٌ
قَصَصًا فِى أَثَرِ فُلَانٍ Such a one went forth following,
or following after, the footsteps of such a one, in
pursuit. (TA.) And it is said in the Kur,
[xviii. 63,] (S,) فَارْتَدَّا عَلَى آثَارِهِمَا قَصَصًا (S, K)
And they both returned by the way by which they
had come, retracing their footsteps. (K, TA.)
―
-b2-  [And hence,] قَصَّ عَلَيْهِ الخَبَرَ, (S, M, Msb, *
K, *) and الحَدِيثَ, and الرُّؤْيَا, (A,) aor.
قَصُ3َ, (M,
TA,) inf. n. قَصَصٌ, (M, TA,) or this is a subst.
put in the place of the inf. n. so that it has become
predominant over it, (S,) and قَصٌّ, (M, TA,) or
the latter only is the inf. n., and the former is
[only] a subst., (Msb,) He related to him the
piece of news, or information, (S, M, Msb,) and
the tradition, or story, and the dream, (A,) in its
proper manner (عَلَى وَجْهِهِ): (S, Msb:) or he
made it known [to him]: (K:) and الحَدِيثَ ↓ اقتصّ
he related the tradition, or story, in its proper
manner (عَلَى وَجْهِهِ); (S, K, TA;) as though he
followed its traces, in pursuit, and related it accordingly: (TA:) [i. e., he pursued the course of
the tradition, or story:] and الخَبَرَ ↓ تقصّص he pursued, or sought after, the particulars of the news,
or information, gradually, and deliberately. (M.)
قَصَّ is also said to signify He recited, or delivered,

And it is said in the Kur, [xii. 3,] نَحْنُ نَقُصُّ
عَلَيْكَ أَحْسَنَ القَصَصِ We explain unto thee with
the best explanation: (K, TA:) or, as some say,
قَصٌّ is the inf. n. of the verb used in this sense,
and قَصَصٌ is a subst. [syn. with قِصَّةٌ, q. v.].
(TA.) And in a trad. respecting the Children of
Israel it is said, لَمَّا قَصُّوا هَلَكُوا: or لَمَّا هَلَكُوا قَصُّوا:
accord. to different relations: meaning, When
they relied upon words, and neglected works, they
perished: or when they perished, by neglecting
works, they inclined to, and relied upon, stories.
(TA.)
-A3-  قَصَّهُ المَوْتُ, and قَصَّهُ عَلَى المَوْتِ, or

plastered, or built, (TA,) a house, (S, K, TA,)
and a tomb, which it is forbidden to do, (A, TA,)

3
قاصّهُ, (Msb,) inf. n. مُقَاصَّةٌ (A, Mgh, Msb)
and قِصَاصٌ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) [which latter
is the more common,] He (the relation of a slain
man, A, Mgh, TA, or one who has been wounded,
Mgh, [or mutilated,]) retaliated upon him by
slaying him, or wounding him, (S, * Mgh, Msb,
K,) or mutilating him, (S, * Msb, K, *) so as to
make him quit, or even, with him. (Mgh.) See
also 8. ―
-b2-  Hence, (A, Mgh,) (tropical:)  He made him quit,
or even, with himself: used in a general way.
(Mgh.) You say, قاصّ صَاحِبَهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, *
K,) inf. ns. as above, (Msb,) (tropical:)  He made his fellow
quit, or even, with him, (Mgh,) in a reckoning,
(S, Mgh, K,) or other thing, (S, K,) by withholding from him the like of what the latter owed
to him; (Mgh;) he made a debt which his fellow
owed him to be as a requital of a like debt which
he owed his fellow: [but Fei adds,] this is taken
from إِقْتِصَاصُ الأَثَرِ: and hence the former signification, relating to retaliation of slaughter and
wounding and mutilation, which, however, is the
predominant signification. (Msb.) You say also,
قَاصَصْتُهُ بِمَا كَانَ لِى قَبْلَهُ, [or, more probably,
قِبَلَهُ, or perhaps عَلَيْهِ,] (tropical:)  I withheld from him the
like of what he owed me. (A, TA.) ISd says,
(TA,) The phrase قُوصَّ زَيْدٌ مَا عَلَيْهِ has been
mentioned; and means, in my opinion, (assumed tropical:)  Zeyd
was reckoned with for what he owed: though
made trans. without a particle, as implying the
meaning of أُغْرِمَ and the like. (M, TA.)
4
اقصّهُ, inf. n. إِقْصَاصٌ, He retaliated for him;
(M;) as also ↓ اقتصّهُ; (A; [so in a copy of that
work; but I think it is a mistake for اقصّهُ, or for
اقتصّ لَهُ, q. v.]) or اقتصّ مِنْهُ. (TA [but this
seems to be a mistake for اقتصّ لَهُ.]) You say,
اقصّ فُلَانًا مِنْ فُلَانٍ He (a governor, or prince,)
retaliated for such a one upon such a one, (S, K,)
by wounding the latter like as he had wounded the
former, (S, Msb, K,) or by slaying the latter for
the slaughter of the former; (S, K;) and the like.

power, or authority, to retaliate upon himself,
(K, TA,) by doing to him the like of that which
he had done, whether it be slaughter or mutilation
or beating or wounding. (TA.) [Whence the
saying,] أَقْصَصْتُكَ الجُرْحَةَ (tropical:)  I authorize thee to
adduce anything whereby to invalidate the testimony. (A, * TA, art. جرح.)
-A2-  ضَرَبَهُ حَتَّى أَقَصَّهُ
مِنَ المَوْتِ, (S, K,) and عَلَى المَوْتِ ↓ قَصَّهُ, (K,)
He beat him until he made him to be near to
death: (S, K:) and Fr used to say, ضربه حتّى
أَقَصَّهُ المَوْتَ [meaning as above]. (S.) You say
[also], أَقْصَصْتُهُ عَلَى المَوْتِ [I made him to be
near to death]. (M.) And a poet says,
فَقَدْ أَقْصَصْتَ أُمَّكَ بِالْهُزَالِ
meaning, Thou hast made thy mother to be near
to death. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Fr also said, (S,) المَوْتُ ↓ قَصَّهُ
and أَقَصَّهُ المَوْتُ [in the L and TA قَصَّهُ مِنَ المَوْتِ
and أَقَصَّهُ مِنْهُ, which seems to be a mistranscription,] both signifying Death became near to him:
(S, K:) or he became at the point of death, and
then escaped; (TA;) and so أَقَصَّتْهُ شَعُوبُ: (M:)
and أَقَصَّ على المَوْتِ he became at the point of
death. (M.)

memory his speech, or discourse. (AZ, M, K.)
6
تقاصّوا They made themselves quits, or even,
one with another, by retaliation, (M, TA,) slaying
for slaying, or wounding for wounding. (M.)
A poet says,
فَرُمْنَا القِصَاصَ وَكَانَ التَّقَاص
صُ حُكْمًا وَعَدْلًا عَلَى الْمُسْلِمِينَا
[And we sought retaliation so as to make a party
quit, or even, with us; for people's making themselves quits, or even, one with another, by retaliation, is a statute, and an act of justice, appointed
to the Muslims]: in which التَّقَاصُّ is an instance
of a deviation from a general rule, as it presents
two quiescent letters together in poetry; wherefore some relate it differently, saying, القِصَاصُ:
and there is no other instance of the kind excepting one verse cited by Akh:
وَلَوْلَا خِدَاشٌ أَخَدْتُ دَوَاب
بَ سَعْدٍ وَلَمْ أَعْطِهِ مَا عَلَيْهَا
but Aboo-Is-hák thinks, that, if this verse be
genuine, the right reading is دَوَابِبَ سَعْدٍ, as the
making the duplication of a letter distinct is allowable in poetry; or رَوَاحِلَ سَعْدٍ. (M, TA.) This is the
primary signification of the verb. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
hence, (A, * Mgh, * TA,) [or, accord. to Fei, the
reverse is the case, (see 3,)] (tropical:)  They made themselves quits, or even, one with another, in a
reckoning, (S, A, Mgh, K,) or other thing (S,
A, K) one withholding from another the like of
what the latter owed him. (Mgh.)

-b2-  اقتصّ الحَدِيثَ: see
قَصَّ عَلَيْهِ الخَبَرَ.
-A3-  He retaliated, slaying for
slaying, or wounding for wounding. (M.) You
say, اقتصّ لِفُلَانٍ مِنْ فُلَانٍ (S, A, K) He retaliated
for such a one upon such a one, by wounding the
latter like as he had wounded the former, or by
slaying the latter for the slaughter of the former,
(S, K, TA,) and the like; (TA;) as also مِنْهُ ↓ أَقَصَّهُ.
(S, K.) [See the latter verb, first signification.]
And ↓ أَفَصَّهُ, inf. n. إِقْصَاصٌ, signifies [also] He
(the Sultán) slew him in retaliation. (Msb.) ―
-b2-
اِقْتِصَاصٌ, as a subst., [i. e., having no verb corresponding to the signification here following,
though I do not see how this can be asserted, for
one may certainly say اُقْتُصَّ مِنْهُ,] also signifies
The being done to like as one has done, whether it
be slaughter or mutilation or beating or wounding.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  See also 10.
10
استقصّ He sought, or demanded, retaliation,
i. e., slaying for slaying, or wounding for wounding. (M.) ―
-b2-  استقصّهُ He asked of him to retaliate for him: (S, A, Msb, K:) and ↓ اقتصّهُ
signifies the same accord. to the K; but the author
has been misled into saying this by misunderstanding the following passage in the O; تقصّص
اثره مثل قَصَّهُ واقتصّهُ واستقصّهُ سَأَلَهُ أَنْ يُقِصَّهُ, in
which واقتصّه terminates a clause. (TA.)
قَصٌّ (M, K) and ↓ قَصَصٌ (M, TA) What is cut,
or clipped, or shorn, of the wool of a sheep. (M,
K, TA.) See also قُصَاصَةٌ.

(M, A, K) of anything: (M:) or the head
thereof, (S, K,) called in Persian سر سينه [i. e.

into which are set the cartilaginous ends of the
[seven upper pairs of the] ribs, in the middle of
the breast: (Lth, TA:) pl. قِصَاصٌ [a reg. pl. of
the first]. (K.) Hence the saying, هُوَ أَلْزَمُ لَكَ
مِنْ شُعَيْرَاتِ قَصِّكَ, (S,) or هُوَ أَلْزَمُ بِكَ مِنْ شَعَرَاتِ
قَصِّكَ, and ↓ قَصَصِكَ, (M, TA,) [He is more closely
adherent to thee than the little hairs, or the hairs,
of thy breast, &c.:] because as often as they are
cut they grow [afresh]: (As, TA:) meaning, he
will not separate himself from thee, nor canst thou
cast him from thee: applied to him who denies
his relation: and also to him who denies a due
that is incumbent on him. (Sgh, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, the
same three words, (the first and ↓ second accord.
to the TA, and the ↓ third accord. to the K) and

Msb) in the dial. of El-Hijáz: (S:) or ↓ قَصَّةٌ and
↓ قِصَّةٌ, (K,) the latter on the authority of IDrd,
(TA,) and said by Aboo-Bekr to be with kesr,
but by others said to be with fet-h, (Seer, TA,)
are syn. with جَصَّةٌ [and جِصَّةٌ, ns. un. of جَصٌّ and
