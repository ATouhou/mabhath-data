قُوت. (TA.) It is said in a trad., كَفَى بِالمَرْءِ
إِثْمًا أَنْ يُضَيِّعَ مَنْ يَقُوتُ i. e. [It suffices the man
as a sin, or crime, that he destroy] him whom he
is bound to sustain, of his family and household
and slaves: or, as some relate it, ↓ مَنْ يُقِيتُهُ;
using a dial. var. [of يقوت]. (TA.) [And

or sustains, himself with such a thing], (S, O,) or
بِالقَلِيلِ [with that which is little]: (Msb:) or

-b3-  The saying, of Tufeyl,
يَقْتَاتُ فَضْلَ سَنَامِهَا الرَّحْلُ
is held by ISd to mean, (assumed tropical:)  The saddle [as it were]
eats the remainder of her hump, [as though]
making it to be food for itself: accord. to IAar,
he says, the meaning is, takes it away thing after
thing [or piecemeal]; but I have not heard this
[meaning] in any other instance: hence, says
IAar, the oath sworn one day by El-'Okeylee,
[said in the A to be an oath of the Arabs of the
desert,] نَفْسِى البَصِيرِ مَا فَعَلْتُ ↓ لَا وَقَائِتِ, for, he
says, الاِقْتِيَاتُ [the inf. n. of اقتات] and القَوْتُ
[inf. n. of ↓ قَاتَ] are one [in signification]; and
AM says that the meaning of this is, [No, by]
Him who takes my spirit, breath after breath,
until He has taken it wholly, [the All-seeing, I
did not that thing:] and the saying of Tufeyl
means the saddle, while I am riding upon it,
takes by little and little the fat of her hump until
there remains not of it aught. (TA.) ―

says also, الحَرْبُ تَقْتَاتُ الإِبِلَ (tropical:)  [War makes the

a one retrenches, or curtails, speech, or talk; [said
of one who speaks, or talks, little;] syn. يُقِلُّهُ.
(A.)
-A2-  See also 1, latter half. [Hence,] one
says, ↓ اِقْتَتْ لِنَارِكَ قِيتَةً (assumed tropical:)  [Supply to thy fire ali-
ment;] feed thy fire with fuel. (S, O, K.) And

[
قَاتٌ A species of tree, of the class Pentandria,
order Monogynia, of the Linnæan system; belonging to the natural order of Celastraceæ;
mentioned in botanical works under the name of
Catha edulis; and fully described by Forskål in
his Flora Ægypt. Arab., pp. 63, 64; in the latter
page of which he says: “ In Yemen colitur
iisdem hortis cum Coffea. Stipitibus plantatur.
Arabes folia viridia avide edunt, multum eorum
vires venditantes, qui copiosius comederit, vel
totam vigilet noctem: asseverant quoque pestem
ea loca non intrare ubi hæc colitur arbor: ” &c.
―
-b2-  And in the same work, p. cxviii., Forskål
mentions قات الرعيان (by which is meant قَاتُ
الرُّعْيَانِ) as the name of A species of lettuce, lactuca
inermis. ―
-b3-  Respecting the former plant, see also
De Sacy's Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed., i. 462, 463.]

provisions, by means of which the body of man is
sustained; (S, A, * O, K; *) as also ↓ قِيتٌ and
↓ قِيتَةٌ, (S, O, K,) as used in phrases here following, (S, O,) with kesr to the ق, and the و changed
into ى, (S,) and ↓ قَائِتٌ and ↓ قُوَاتٌ, (K,) the last
mentioned, but not expl., by Lh, and thought by
ISd to be from قُوتٌ: (TA:) what is eaten for
the purpose of retaining the remains of life; (A, *
O, * Msb, TA; *) thus expl. by Az and IF:
(Msb:) or food sufficient to sustain life: (TA:)
pl. أَقْوَاتٌ. (Msb, TA.) One says, مَا عِنْدَهُ قُوتُ
لَيْلَةٍ and لَيْلَةٍ ↓ قِيتُ and لَيْلَةٍ ↓ قِيتَةُ (S, O, TA)
He has not a night's food sufficient to sustain life.

of subsistence]. (S. O.) ―

-b2-  And
hence,] Keeping, preserving, guarding, or protecting; or a keeper, &c.; syn. حَافِظٌ [as signifying thus; and app. as signifying also watching;
or a watcher]: (S, A, O, Msb, K:) and witnessing; or a witness; syn. شَاهِدٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;)
or شَهِيدٌ: (A:) and AO says that it signifies,
with the Arabs, one acquainted (مَوْقُوفٌ) with a
thing (عَلَى شَىْءٍ). (TA.) Th cites the following
verses (of Es-Semow'al Ibn-Ádiyà, O):
لَيْتَ شِعْرِى وَأَشْعُرَنَّ إِذَا مَا
قَرَّبُوهَا مَنْشُورَةً وَدُعِيتُ
أَلِىَ الفَضْلُ أَمْ عَلَىَّ إِذَا حُو
سِبْتُ إِنِّى عَلَى الحِسَابِ مُقِيتُ
[meaning Would that I knew, but I shall assuredly
know when they shall have set it (namely, the
صَحِيفَة, or record, of my actions,) near, unfolded,
and I am summoned, whether superiority be for
me or against me when I am reckoned with:
verily I shall be a watcher, or a witness, of the
reckoning, or, accord. to some, as is said in the
TA, acquainted with the reckoning]: i. e. I shall
know what evil I have done; for [as is said in
the Kur lxxv. 14] man shall be a witness against
himself: (S, O, TA:) IB says that, accord. to
Seer, the correct reading is, رَبِّى على الحساب مقيت
[meaning my Lord is able to make the reckoning]
because he who is submissive to his Lord does
not describe himself by this epithet: but IB adds
that Seer has founded this remark upon the assumption that مقيت is here used as meaning
مُقْتَدِرٌ; and that if it be understood as syn. with
حَافِظٌ and شَاهِدٌ, the former reading is not objectionable. (TA.) ―
-b3-  المُقِيتُ is one of the best
names of God: (TA:) and [as such] signifies
The Possessor of power; (Fr, Zj, S, O, Msb, K,
TA;) as He who gives to every man his قُوت [or
food], (F, S, O, K, TA,) and likewise to everything: (TA:) or (as one of those names, TA)
the Preserver, or Protector, (Zj, TA,) who gives
to everything such preservation, or protection, as
is needful. (TA.) It is said in the Kur [iv. 87],
وَكَانَ اللّٰهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ مُقِيتًا, (S, O,) meaning
[For God is] a possessor of power [over everything,
or is omnipotent], (Ksh, Bd, Jel,) so He will requite everyone for what he has done: (Jel:) or
a witness, [and] a preserver, or protector, or
watcher. (Ksh, Bd.)
