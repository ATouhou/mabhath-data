قنح1
قَنَحَهُ, (S, K, TA,) aor.
قَنَحَ, (K, TA,) inf. n.
قَنْحٌ, (S, TA,) He bent it, or curved it, (S, K,
TA,) i. e. a thing, (S,) or a stick, or branch,
(TA,) [at the end,] like a مِحْجَن, (S, K, TA,)
or صَوْلَجَان. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And قَنَحَ البَابَ He hewed,
or cut out, a wooden implement, (called a قُنَّاحَة
[q. v.], L,) and with it raised [and opened] the
door; as also ↓ اقنحهُ: (T, L, K, TA:) or [simply]
he raised [and opened] the door with the wooden
implement called a قُنَّاحَة; and so ↓ قنّحهُ: (A:)
[or] البالبَ ↓ قنّح, (S, K,) inf. n. تَقْنِيحٌ, (K,) He
adjusted (أَصْلَحَ) a قُنَّاحَة to the door. (S, K.)
-A2-
And قَنَحَ, (K, TA,) aor. and inf. n. as above,
(TA,) said of one drinking, He satisfied his thirst,
and, by reason thereof, raised his head; and
showed, or expressed, dislike of drinking (تَكَارَهَ عَلَى
الشُّرْبِ); like ↓ تقنّح; (K, TA;) which is the
more approved [and to which, as well as to the
former verb, both of the clauses of the explanation above relate, as will be shown by what
follows]: in some of the copies [of the K] like
↓ قنّح: accord. to AHn, one says, قَنَحَ مِنَ الشَّرَابِ,
aor. and inf. n. as above, meaning he sipped [of
the wine or beverage]; and accord. to Az, ↓ تَقَنَّحْتُ
مِنَ الشَّرَابِ, which, he says, is the prevailing expression: hence the saying of Umm-Zara, أَشْرَبُ
↓ فَأَتَقَنَّحُ, i. e. I [drink, and] stop, or interrupt,
drinking, and proceed leisurely therein: or, I
drink after the satisfying of thirst: which latter
explanation, mentioned on the authority of AZ,
is that which is approved by Sh and Az, in
opposition to Aboo-'Abd-Allah Et-Tuwál, who
thought it to mean I drink by little and little.
(TA. [See also this saying of Umm-Zara, with
another reading of it, in the last sentence but one
of art. قمح.])

قِنْحٌ [thus accord. to the L] is expl. in the 'Eyn
as meaning Thy making a قُنَّاحَة with which thou
wilt fasten (تَشُدُّ) the side-post of thy door and the
like; termed by the Persians قانه [app. a mistranscription for فَانَهٌ, a wooden peg, which,
dropping into the bolt of a lock, or the like, prevents its being opened until the said peg is pulled
up]; but ISd says, I know not how this is, for
the explanation is not good; and I think قِنْحٌ
here is a dial. var. of قُنَّاحٌ [q. v.]. (L.)
قَنَّاحٌ and ↓ قَنَّاحَةٌ [thus in the L, but app. the ق
should be with damm in both words,] A stick, or
branch, bent, or curved, [at the end,] like a
صَوْلَجَان [q. v.]. (L.)
قُنَّاحٌ A bar (مِتْرَس [or مَتَرْس]) of a door.
(IAar, L.)
قَنَّاحَةٌ: see قَنَّاحٌ.
قُنَّاحَةٌ A crooked, or curved, long مِفْتَاح [or
instrument for opening a door]: (S, L, K:) [from
what here follows, it seems to be a kind of wooden
lever, with a crooked, or curved, end, with which
a door is raised and opened: (see also 1:)] a
wooden implement with which a door is raised
[and opened, app. by lifting the lower pivot (which
serves as a hinge) out of its socket]: (A, L:) and
any piece of wood that is inserted beneath another
[as a lever] in order to move it. (L.)
