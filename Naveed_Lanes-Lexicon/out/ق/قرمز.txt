قرمزقِرْمِزٌ, a Persian word, arabicized; (TA;) [The
insect called coccus: and particularly the coccus
baphica, or coccus ilicis; commonly called by us,
from the Persian and Arabic, kermes: and also
applied to that species which is the true cochineal:]
a certain Armenian dye, (Lth, K,) of a red
colour, (Lth, TA,) obtained from the expressed
fluid of a kind of worm found in the woods of
Armenia: (Lth, K:) such is said to be the case:
and in some of the correct copies of the K we find
the following addition: it is said to be red like the
lentil, in the form of grains: it falls upon a species
of بَلَّوط, [or oak,] in the month of آذَار, [or March,
O. S.,] and if not gathered, it becomes a flying
thing, and flies: it is used as a dye for animal
substances, such as wool and skill, but not cotton.
(TA.)
قِرْمِزِىٌّ Dyed with قِرْمِز: or resembling the colour
of that dye: (the book entitled ما لا يسع الطبيب
جهله, by Ibn-El-Kutbee; cited by Golius:) [in
the present day, crimson; or of a deep red
colour.]
