قط1
قَطَّهُ, aor.
قَطُ3َ, (S, M,) inf. n. قَطٌّ, (M, K,) He cut
it, in a general sense: (M, K:) or he cut it, meaning
a hard thing, such as a حُقّة [or box], (Lth, M,
K,) and the like, (M,) in a good form, or fashion,
like as a man cuts a reed upon a bone; (Lth;)
and ↓ تَقْطِيطٌ, also, [inf. n. of قطّطهُ,] signifies the
cutting a حُقَّة, (K, TA,) and making it even:
(TA:) or قَطَّهُ signifies he cut it breadthwise,
across, or crosswise; (S, M, O, K;) he so separated it; (Kh, S;) opposed to قَدَّهُ, (S, TA,)
which signifies he cut it in halves lengthwise,
like as one cuts a strap or thong: (TA:) and
↓ اقتطّهُ signifies the same. (M, K. *) You say,
قَطَّ القَلَمَ, (S, Msb,) aor. as above, (K,) and so
the inf. n., (Msb,) He nibbed the reed for writing;
cut off its head breadthwise, across, or crosswise.
(S, * Msb.) And قَطَّ البَيْطَارُ حَافِرَ الدَّابَّةِ The farrier pared, and made even, the hoof of the beast
of carriage. (TA.)
-A2-  قَططَ الشَّعَرُ, (S, M, K,)
with the reduplication made manifest, (S, M,)
and قَطَّ, aor. يَقَطُّ, (M, Msb, K,) and, of the latter,
يَقُطُّ also, [contr. to the general rule,] (Msb,)
inf. n., of the former, قَطٌّ, (M, TA,) which is
extr., (M,) and of the latter, (M, TA,) قَطَطٌ and
قَطَاطَةٌ, (M, K,) The hair was, or became,
[frizzled, or] very crisp, very curly, or much
twisted, and contracted: (S, * Msb:) or like that
of the زَنْجِىّ: (Msb:) or crisp, curly, or twisted,
and contracted, and short. (M, K.)
-A3-  قَطَّ السِّعْرُ,
(S, M, Msb, K,) aor. يَقِطُّ, (S, K,) with kesr, (S,
TA,) or يَقُطُّ, (M, Msb,) the verb being co-ordinate
to قَتَلَ, [contr. to the general rule,] (Msb) inf. n.
قَطٌّ (S, M, Msb, K) and قُطُوطٌ; (M, K;) as also
قُطَّ, with damm; (Fr, K;) The price was, or
became, dear, (S, M, Msb, K,) and high: (Msb:)
Sh thought this explanation to be wrong, and the
meaning to be the price flagged; but Az says,
that in this he was mistaken. (TA.) ―
-b2-  قَطَّ اللّٰهُ
السِّعْرَ God made the price to be, or become, dear.
(Fr. TA.)

R. Q. 1
قَطْقَطَتِ السَّمَآءُ The sky let fall rain,
(AZ, S, M,) or hail, (M,) such as is termed
قِطْقِطٌ: (AZ, S, M:) or the sky rained. (K.)
قَطْ, signifying حَسْبُ, [explained in exs. here
following,] (Lth, S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K,) i. e.,
(S,) denoting the being satisfied, or content, (Sb,
S, M, Msb,) with a thing, (Msb,) is thus written,
with fet-h to the ق, and with the ط quiescent,
(Sb, S, M, Msb, * Mughnee,) like عَنْ; (K;)
and also, (Sb, M, K,) sometimes, (Sb, M,)
↓ قَطٍ, (Sb, M, K,) with tenween, mejroor; (K;)
and ↓ قَطِى [distinguished from قَطِى in the next
sentence]; (Sb, M, K;) but the term “ mejroor ”
is here used contr. to the rules of grammar, as it
denotes that قط is decl., whereas it is not.
(MF.) It is used as a prefixed noun: you say,
قَطْكَ هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ Thy sufficiency [meaning sufficient for thee] is this thing; syn. حَسْبُكَ; (Lth,
S, Mughnee; *) and like it is قَدْ: (Lth:) and you
also say, using it as a prefixed n., قَطْنِى My sufficiency; syn. حَسْبِى; (Lth, S, * Mughnee;) like
قَدْنِى; introducing ن, (Lth, S, TA,) as in
عَنِّى and مِنِّى and لَدُنِّى, contr. to rule, for the
reason which has been explained in treating of
قَدْ, (S, TA,) to preserve the original quiescence
of the ط; (Mughnee;) and قَطِى; (S, Msb,
Mughnee;) and ↓ قَطِ; (S;) and ↓ قَطَاطِ, (S, M,
K,) like قَطَامِ, (S, K,) indecl.; (M;) as signifying حَسْبِى: (S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K:) and, as
is said in the Moo'ab, قَطْ عَبْدِ اللّٰهِ دِرْهَمٌ The sufficiency of 'Abd-Allah is a dirhem; [and the like
is said by Lth and in the Mughnee;] pausing
upon the ط, and making قط to govern a gen.
case [as it does virtually in the preceding instances]; and the Basrees say, that this is the
right mode, as meaning the like of حَسْبُ زَيْدٍ
دِرْهَمٌ and كَفْىَ زَيْدٍ دِرْهَمٌ: (K:) or some say قَطْ,
with jezm; and some say ↓ قَطُ, making it inded.
with damm for its termination; each governing
what follows it in the gen. case. (M.) ―
-b2-  It is
also a verbal noun, signifying يَكْفِى [It suffices,
or will suffice; or it is, or will be, sufficient]; and
when this is the case, you say, قَطْنِى, (Mughnee,
K,) like as you say, يَكْفِينِى [It suffices me,
or will suffice me]; (Mughnee;) or كَفَانِى [which
means, emphatically, it suffices me], accord. to
the Koofees; (Lth;) which is also allowable
when قَطْ is equivalent to حَسْبُ [as we have observed above]: (Mughnee:) and you say also,
قَطْكَ, meaning كَفَاكَ [emphatically It suffices
thee]: and قَطِى, meaning كَفَانِى [emphatically
It suffices me]: (K:) so in the copies of the K;
[in the CK, erroneously, قَطَّنِى;] but [it seems
that it should be قَطْنِى; for] it is said in the
Mughnee and its Expositions, that in this last
case the addition of the ن is indispensable:
(MF:) and some say, قَطْ عَبْدَ اللّٰهِ دِرْهَمٌ [A
dirhem suffices, or will suffice, 'Abd-Allah (in
the CK, erroneously, قَطُّ)]; making it to
govern the accus. case [as it does virtually
in preceding instances]: and some add ن,
saying, عَبْدَ اللّٰهِ دِرْهَمٌ ↓ قَطْنُ [meaning the
same]: (Lth, K:) [hence,] some say, that [قَطْن
in] قَطْنِى is a word originally thus formed without any augmentation, like [حَسْب in] حَسْبِى;
(M;) [but J says,] if the ن in قَطْنِى belonged to
the root of the word, they had said قَطْنُكَ, which
is not known. (S.) ―
-b3-  It is also syn. with حَسْبُ in
the phrase مَا رَأَيْتُهُ إِلَّا مَرَّةً وَاحِدَةً فَقَطٌ [I have not
seen him, or it, save once, and that was a thing
sufficient or that was enough]: (S, Msb: *) or, as
is said in the Mutowwel, قَطْ in فَقَطْ is a verbal
noun, meaning abstain thou [from further questioning, or the like], as though it were the complement of a condition suppressed [such as “ the
case being so ”]: or, as is said in the Mesáïl of
Ibn-Es-Seed, the ف is properly prefixed because
the meaning is and I was satisfied, or content,
therewith; so that the ف is a conjunction: (from
a marginal note in a copy of the Mughnee:) [it
therefore virtually signifies and no more; or
only; and thus it may often be rendered: and
this explains what here follows:] when قَط is
used to denote paucity, (M, K,) which is said by
El-Hareeree, in the Durrah, to be only in negative phrases, (MF,) it is [written قَطْ,] with jezm,
(M, K,) and without teshdeed: (M:) you say,
مَا عِنْدَكَ إِلَّا هٰذَا قَطْ [which may be rendered Thou
hast not save this only]: but when it is followed
by a conjunctive ا, it is with kesr; [as in the saying,] مَا عَلِمْتُ إِلَّا هٰذَا قَطِ اليَوْمَ [virtually mean-
ing I knew not, or, emphatically, know not, save
this only, to-day]: (K:) and also, (K,) when
thus using it, (M,) you say, مَا لَهُ إِلَّا عَشَرَةٌ قَطْ
يَافَتَى [likewise virtually meaning He has not
save ten only, O young man], without teshdeed,
and with jezm; and ↓ قَطِّ, with teshdeed and
khafd; (Lh, M, K;) the kesreh of the latter, in
a case of this kind, being to distinguish the قَطّ
which denotes [paucity of] number from قَطُّ,
which denotes time. (Lth.)
-A2-  See also قَطُّ,
first sentence.
قُطْ: see قَطُّ.
قَطُ: see قَطْ:
-A2-  and see also قَطُّ.
قَطِ: see قَطْ.
قُطُ: see قَطُّ.
قَطٍ: see قَطْ.
قَطَّ: see قَطُّ.
قَطُّ is an adv. noun, (Mughnee,) [generally]
denoting time, (S, M, Mughnee,) or past time,
(Msb, K,) used to include all past time; (Lth,
Mughnee;) as also ↓ قُطُّ, (S, M, Mughnee, K,)
the former vowel being assimilated to the latter;
(S, Mughnee;) and ↓ قَطُ, (S, M, Mughnee, K,)
and ↓ قُطُ; (S, Mughnee, * K;) and some say
↓ قَطْ, (S, Mughnee,) whence قَطُ is formed, by
making its termination similar to that of the primary form قَطُّ, to show its origin; (S, M;) or
this would be better than قَطُ; (M;) and ↓ قُطْ,
(S, M, Mughnee, *) like مُذْ, which is rare: (S,
M:) of all these, the first is the most chaste:
(Mughnee:) when time is meant by it, it is
always with refa, without tenween: (K:) or one
says also ↓ قَطِّ, (M, Mughnee, K,) with kesr and
teshdeed to the ط, (M, K,) accord. to IAar;
(M;) and ↓ قَطَّ, with fet-h and teshdeed to the
ط; (M, * K;) as well as with damm to the ط
without teshdeed. (K [in some copies of which
is here added, “and with refa to the ط; ” to
which is further added in the CK, “without
teshdeed: ” but I find two copies without any
addition of this redundant kind: for by “ refa ” is
here meant, as in a former instance, “damm; ”
though improperly, as the word is indecl.]) You
say, مَا رَأَيْتُهُ قَطُّ &c. [I have not seen him, or it,
ever, or hitherto]; (S, M, K;) and مَا فَعَلْتُهُ قَطَّ
[I have not done it ever, or hitherto]; (Msb,
Mughnee;) i. e., in the time that is past; (Msb,
K;) or in what has been cut off of my life;
(Mughnee, K;) its derivation being from قَطَطْتُ
meaning “ I cut; ” for the past is cut off from the
present and the future; and it is indecl. because
it implies the meaning of مُذْ and إِلَى; its meaning being مُذْ أَنْ خُلِقْتُ إِلَى الآنَ [since my being
created until now]; and with a vowel for its termination to prevent the occurrence of two quiescent letters together; (Mughnee;) and it is with
refa [meaning damm for its termination] because
it is like قَبْلُ and بَعْدُ: (Lth:) accord. to Ks,
(S,) قَطُّ is a contraction of قَطَطُ: (S, M:) Sb
says, that it denotes الإِنْتِهَآء; [app. meaning that
it signifies abstain thou from further questioning,
or the like; for El-Hareeree says, in the Durrah,
that قَطُّ and قَطْ both signify the same as حَسْبُ;]
and that it is indecl., with damm for its termination, like حَسْبُ. (M.) You say also, مَا فَعَلْتُ
هٰذَا قَطْ وَلَا قَطُّ [app. meaning I have not done this
alone, nor ever]: (K, TA: [in the CK قَطُّ ولا قُطُ,
but]) the former قط is with jezm to the ط, and
the latter is with teshdeed and damm to the ط.
(TA.) And يَا فَتَى ↓ مَا زَالَ عَلَى هٰذَا مُذْ قُطَّ
[He, or it, has not ceased to be after this manner
during all past time, O young man]; with damm
to the ق, and with teshdeed. (Lh, M.) It is
used only in negative phrases relating to past
time; the saying of the vulgar لَا أَفْعَلُهُ قَطُّ [meaning I will not do it ever] being incorrect; (Mughnee, K; [in the CK قَطُ]) for with respect to the
future you say عَوْضُ (TA) [or أَبَدًا]: or it is
mostly so used, accord. to Ibn-Málik: (MF:)
but it occurs after an affirmative phrase in places
in El-Bukháree, (K,) in his Saheeh; (TA;) for
ex., أَطْوَلُ صَلَاةٍ صَلَّيْتُهَا قَطُّ [The longest prayer
which I have prayed ever]: and in the Sunan of
Aboo-Dawood; تَوَضَّأَ ثَلَاثًا قَطُّ [He performed the
وُضُوْء three times ever]: and Ibn-Málik asserts it
to be right, and says that it is one of the things
which have been unperceived by many of the
grammarians: (K:) El-Karmánee, however, interprets these instances as though they were
negative. (TA.)

and short, hair: (M, K:) or hair that is
very crisp, very curly, or much twisted and
contracted: or, accord. to the T, ↓ قَطَطٌ means
hair of the زَنْجِىّ: (Msb:) or you say,
↓ جَعْدٌ قَطَطٌ, meaning very crisp, very curly, or
much twisted and contracted. (S.) ―
-b2-  رَجُلٌ قَطٌّ,
and ↓ قَطَطٌ, (Msb,) or رَجُلٌ قَطُّ الشَّعَرِ, and ↓ قَطَطُ
الشَّعَرِ, (S, M, K,) A man whose hair is crisp,
curly, or twisted and contracted, and short: (M,
K:) or whose hair is very crisp, very curly, or
much twisted and contracted; (S, * Msb;) as also
↓ قِطَاطٌ: (K: accord. to some copies; but
accord. to other copies, as a pl. in this sense:
[the reading of the latter is more probably correct, and is that of the TA:]) or beautifully
crisp or curly or twisted and contracted: (TA:)
the pl. [of قَطٌّ] is أَقْطَاطٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and قَطُّونَ
and قِطَاطٌ; and [of ↓ قَطَطٌ] قَطَطُونَ: (M, K:) the
epithet applied to a woman is قَطَّةٌ, and ↓ قَطَطٌ
without ة. (M, Msb.)

(M, A, Msb, K,) of gifts, (A, TA,) &c. (TA.)
Hence the saying in the Kur, [xxxviii. 15,]
رَبَّنَا عَجِّلْ لَنَا قِطَّنَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ الحِسَابِ (tropical:)  [O our Lord,
hasten to us our portion before the day of reckoning]: accord. to some, our portion of punishment: but accord. to Sa'eed Ibn-Jubeyr, it
means, of Paradise. (TA.) ―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  A writing;
(Fr, S, Msb;) [such as that of a man's works;]
and hence, accord. to Fr, the words of the Kur
cited above; those words being said in derision:
(TA:) or a writing of reckoning: (M, K:) or a
written obligation: (M:) or it signifies also a
written obligation binding one to give a gift or
present; (S, K, TA;) and hence the saying in
the Kur cited above: (S:) pl. قُطُوطٌ: (S, M,
Msb, K:) which Az explains as meaning gifts,
and stipends; so called because they were issued
written in the form of notes and statements of
obligation upon cut pieces of paper or the like.
(TA.) ―

-A2-  A male cat: (S, M, Msb, K:) the
female is called قِطَّةٌ: (Lth, S, M, Msb:) Kr
disallowed this latter; and IDrd says, I do not
think it to be genuine Arabic; (M;) but to this
it is objected that it occurs in traditions: (MF:)
the pl. is قِطَاطٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and قِطَطَةٌ, (M,
K,) or قِطَطٌ. (Msb.)
