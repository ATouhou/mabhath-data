This beast has in her a property of raising and
putting down her fore legs together, and beating

others, a sewed garment with two sleeves, not
opened [down the front], worn beneath the [other]
clothes; (TA;) accord. to El-Hulwánee, that of
which the slit is towards, or to, the shoulder-joint;
thus differing from a woman's دِرْع, of which the
opening for the head to pass through extends
towards, or to, the bosom; but this [says Mtr]
I find not in the lexicons: (Mgh, art. درع:)
“ or,” as in some copies of the K, but in others
“ and,” (TA,) only of cotton, (K,) or of linen;
(TA;) not of wool: (Sgh, K:) or by this is
app. meant that such is generally the case: (Ibn-El-Hajar El-Mekkee, TA:) accord. to some, it
may be from the skin [so called] which is the
pericardium; [but accord. to Z, the reverse is
the case;] or from تَقَيَّصَ signifying “ he turned
himself over: ” (TA:) sometimes fem.: (K:)
or masc.; but sometimes meaning a coat of mail
(دِرْعٌ), and then it is fem.: (M, TA:) pl. [of

a verse cited in art. سود, conj. 9.] You say,
هَتَكَ الخَوْفُ قَمِيصَ قَلْبِهِ (tropical:)  [Fear rent open his
