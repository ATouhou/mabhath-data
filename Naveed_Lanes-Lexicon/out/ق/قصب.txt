TA:) pl. أَقْصَابٌ. (S. M, Mgh, O, K.) One
says, هُوَ يَجُرُّ قُصْبَهُ [expl. by what here follows].
(S, O.) The Prophet said, respecting 'Amr Ibn-
'Ámir El-Khurá'ee, who first set at liberty
سَوَائِب [pl. of سَائِبَةٌ, q. v.], (O,) or respecting
'Amr Ibn-Kamee-ah, who first changed the
religion of Ishmael, (TA,) رَأَيْتُهُ يَجُرُّ قُصْبَهُ فِى النُّارِ
[I saw him dragging his guts in the fire of Hell].
(O, TA.) ―

وَشَاهِدُنَا الجُلَّ وَاليَاسَمِى
نُ وَالمُسْمِعَاتُ بِأَقْصَابِهَا
means [The rose being present with us, and the
jasmine, and the songstresses] with their chords of

the M,) he said ↓ بِقُصَّابِهَا, meaning with their
musical reeds, or pipes. (S, O.) ―
-b3-  And (tropical:)  The
middle of the body; metaphorically applied thereto: so in the saying of Imra-el-Keys, (S, O, L,)
or, accord. to the people of El-Koofeh and ElBasrah, it is falsely ascribed to him, (O,)
والقُصْبُ مُضْطَمِرٌ وَالمَتْنُ مَلْحُوبُ
[And the middle of the body slender and lean,
and the portion next the back-bone, on either side,
smooth, and sloping downwards]. (S, O, L.) ―
-b4-
And (assumed tropical:)  The back. (O, K. [SM, not having
found this in any lexicon but the K, supposed
that الظَّهْرُ might be substituted in it for الخَصْرُ,
which is not therein mentioned as a meaning of
القُصْبُ.])
قَصَبٌ [a coll. gen. n., signifying Reeds, or
canes; and the like, as the culms of corn, &c.;
and sometimes signifying a reed, or cane, and the
like, as meaning a species thereof;] any plant
having (M, A, Mgh, Msb, K) its stem composed
of (Mgh, Msb) أَنَابِيب [or internodial portions]
(M, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and [their] كُعُوب [or
connecting knots, or joints]; (Mgh, Msb;) [i. e.
any kind, or species, of plant having a jointed
stem;] i. q. أَبَآءٌ [a word comparatively little
known]; (S; [in the O اَناء, a mistranscription;])
and [it is said that] ↓ قَصْبَآءُ signifies the same:
(S, O: [but see what follows:]) the n. un. of
the former is ↓ قَصَبَةٌ (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and
↓ قَصْبَاةٌ or ↓ قَصَبَاةٌ: (K accord. to different copies;
the former accord. to the TA: [but each of these
I believe to be a mistake for ↓ قَصُبْآءَةٌ, which is
said to be a n. un. of قَصْبَآءُ, and therefore held by
some to be syn. with قَصَبَةٌ:]) ↓ قَصْبَآءُ [appears,
however, to differ somewhat from قَصَب, for it is
said that it] signifies an assemblage of قَصَب;
(M, K;) and its n. un. is ↓ قَصَبَةٌ and ↓ قَصْبَآءَةٌ
[like حَلَفَةٌ and حَلْفَآءَةٌ which are both said to be
ns. un. of حَلْفَآءٌ; and طَرَفَةٌ and طَرْفَآءَةٌ, said to be
ns. un. of طَرْفَآءٌ; the former in each case anomalous]: (M: [see also Ham p. 201:]) or, accord.
to Sb, ↓ قَصْبَآءُ is sing. and pl., (S, M, Mgh, O,)
and so طَرْفَآءُ, (S, M, O,) and حَلْفَآءُ; (S, O;) as
pl. and as sing. also having the sign of the fem.
gender; therefore, when they mean to express
the sing. signification, they add the epithet
وَاحِدَةٌ; thus, and thus only, distinguishing the
sing. meaning from the pl., and making a
difference between a word of this class and a
noun that denotes a pl. meaning and has not the
sign of the fem. gender such as تَمْرٌ and بُسْرٌ, and
such as أَرْطًى and عَلْقًى of which the ns. un. are
أَرْطَاةٌ and عَلْقَاةٌ: (M:) or, as some say, ↓ قَصْبَآءُ
signifies many قَصَب growing in a place: (Mgh:)
and it signifies also a place in which قَصَب grow:
(M, K:) [or] ↓ مَقْصَبَةٌ has this last meaning;
(Mgh, Msb;) or signifies, like ↓ أَرْضٌ قَصِبَةٌ, a
land having قَصَب. (M, K. *) ―
-b2-  أَحْرَزَ قَصَبَ
السَّبْقِ, (Msb,) or السَّبْقِ ↓ قَصَبَةَ, (TA,) [meaning
(assumed tropical:)  He won, or acquired, the canes, or cane, of
victory in racing,] is said of the winner in horseracing: they used to set up, in the horse-course,
a cane (قَصَبَة,) and he who outstripped plucked
it up and took it, in order that he might be
known to be the one who outstripped, without
contention: this was the origin of the phrase:
then, in consequence of frequency of usage, it
was applied also to the expeditious, quick, and
light, or active: (Msb, * TA:) [accord. to the
TA, it is a tropical phrase, but perhaps it is so
only when used in the latter way:] it is said in a
trad. of Sa'eed Ibn-El-Ás, that he measured the
horse-course with the cane, making it to be a
hundred canes in length, and the cane was stuck
upright in the ground at the goal, and he who
was first in arriving at it took it, and was entitled to the stake. (O, TA. [See also مُقَصِّبٌ.])
―
-b3-  [The ↓ قَصَبَة here mentioned as A certain
measure of length, used in measuring race-courses,
was also used in other cases, in measuring land,
and differed in different countries and in different
times: accord. to some, it was ten cubits; thus
nearly agreeing with our “ rod: ” (see جَرِيبٌ:)
accord. to others, six cubits and a third of a
cubit: (see فَدَّانٌ:) the modern Egyptian قَصَبَة,
until it was reduced some years ago, was about
twelve English feet and a half; its twentyfourth part, called قَبْضَةٌ, being the measure of a
man's fist with the thumb erect, or about six
inches and a quarter.] ―

made: (Mgh, Msb:) and another kind thereof is
hard and thick; and of this kind are made
musical reeds, or pipes; and with it houses, or
chambers, are roofed. (Msb) One says, قَصَبُ
الخطِّ أَنْفَذُ مِنْ قَصَبِ الخَطِّ [meaning Writingreeds are more penetrating, or effective, than the
canes of El-Khatt (which are spears); i. e.,
words wound more than spears]. (A, TA.) ―
-b5-
قَصَبُ السُّكَّرِ is well-known [as meaning The
sugar-cane]: (Msb:) this is of three kinds;
white and yellow and black: of the first and
second, but not of the third, the juice [of which
sugar is made] is expressed; and this expressed
juice is called عَسَلُ القَصَبِ. (Mgh.) ―
-b6-  قَصَبُ
الذَّرِيرَةِ [is Calamus aromaticus; also called قَصَبُ
الطِّيبِ]: a species thereof has the joints near together, and breaks into many fragments, or
splinters, and the internodial portions thereof are
filled with a substance like spiders' webs: when
chewed, it has an acrid taste, and it is aromatic
(Mgh, Msb) when brayed, or powdered; (Mgh;)

Msb. [See also ذَرِيرَةٌ, in art. ذر.]) ―
-b7-  قَصَبٌ also

(IAar, O, K) i. e. [Rejoice thou Khadeejeh by

of brilliant pearls, &c.: (IAar, O:) or the meaning is, of hollow pearls [or pearl], spacious, like

(TA voce بَيْتٌ:) and it is said by some to convey
an allusion to Khadeejeh's acquiring what is
