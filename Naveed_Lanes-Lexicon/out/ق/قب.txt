smoothish, blackish thing, the head of which is like
that of the [beetle termed] خُنْفَسَآء, and long, and
its legs are like those of the خنفسآء, than which it

قبّان is party-coloured, black and white, with white
legs, having a nose like that of the hedge-hog; when
it is moved, it feigns itself dead, so that it appears
like a [small] globular piece of dung; but when the
voice is withheld, it goes away: (M, TA:) MF
says that the appellation عير قبّان is used only in
poetry, in a case of necessity, for the sake of the

thereof; and that the people of El-Yemen apply
the appellation حمار قبّان to a certain insect, or
small creeping thing, above the size of a locust, of
the same sort as the فَرَاش [generally meaning
moth]: in the Mufradát of Ibn-El-Beytár, it is
said that what is called حمار قبّان is also called
حِمَارُ البَيْتِ: the reason for the appellation [حمار
قبّان] seems to be because its back resembles a
قُبَّة: (TA:) قَبَّان in this case is of the measure
فَعْلَان, from قَبَّ, (S, O, K,) because the Arabs
imperfectly decline it, and they use it determinately; if it were of the measure فَعَّال, they would
decline it perfectly; the pl. is حُمُرُ قَبَّانَ. (S, O.)
