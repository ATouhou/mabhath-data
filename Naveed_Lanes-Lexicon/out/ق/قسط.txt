قسّطهُ, (IAar, M, TA,) inf. n. تَقْسِيطٌ,
(IAar, TA,) He distributed it; or dispersed it.
(IAar, M, TA.) It is implied in the K that the
verb in this sense is ↓ قَسَطَ, of three letters [only,
without teshdeed]. (TA.) You say, قسّط المَالَ
بِيْنَهُمْ He distributed the property among them.
(TA.) And قسّط الخَرَاجَ عَلَيْهِمْ He assigned the
several portions which each one of them should
pay of the [tax called] خراج: (TA:) or قسّط
الخَرَاجَ, inf. n. as above, signifies he assessed, or
apportioned, the خراج (Mgh, Msb) with equity
and equality, (Mgh,) to be paid at certain times.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  قسّط عَلَى عِيَالِهِ النَّفَقَةَ, (TA,) inf. n. as

اقسط, (S, M, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. إِقْسَاطٌ,
(Mgh, K,) He acted equitably, or justly, (S, M,
Mgh, Msb, K,) in his judgment or the like;
(M, TA;) as also, (Msb, K,) accord. to IKtt,
(Msb,) ↓ قَسَطَ, aor.
قَسِطَ (Msb, K) and
قَسُطَ, (K,) but
the former of these aors., as well as the former
verb, is the more known, (TA,) inf. n. قَسْطٌ,
(Msb, TA,) or قِسْطٌ [q. v. infra]; (M, K;) or
إِقْسَاطٌ is only in division: (TA:) thus the latter
of these two verbs is made to have two contr.
significations: (Msb, TA:) in the former of
them, accord. to some, the أ has a privative effect,
[so that the verb properly signifies he did away
with, or put away, injustice, or the like,] as [it
has in اشكاه] in the phrase شَكَى إِليَسْهِ فَأَشْكَاهُ
[he complained to him and he made his complaint to cease]. (TA.) It is said in the Kur,
[iv. 3,] وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلَّا تُقْسِطُوا فِى اليَتَامَى [And if
ye fear lest ye should not act equitably with
respect to the orphans]: (Mgh:) or, accord. to
one reading, ↓ تَقْسُطُوا, with damm to the س.
(TA.) And you say also, أَقْسَطْتُ بَيْنَهُمْ [I acted
equitably between them], and إِلَيْهِمْ [towards
them]. (TA.)
5
تَقَسَّطُوا الشَّىْءِ بَيْنَهُمْ They divided the thing
among themselves (Lth, S, * M [in which last بينهم
is omitted] and O, L, K) equitably, (M, O,) or
equitably and equally, (L,) or with equality.
(Lth, K.) You say also, المَالَ بَيْنَهُمْ ↓ إِقْتَسَطُوا
They divided the property among themselves;
(TK;) إِقْتِسَاطٌ being syn. with إِقْتِسَامٌ. (K.)

إِقْتَسَطَ see 5.
قُسْطٌ a dial. var. of كُسْطٌ, or, accord. to

trad., القُسْطُ البَحْرِىُّ [or قُسْط of the sea] is
mentioned as one of the best of remedies: and in
another trad., قُسْط is coupled by the conjunction
و with أَظْفَار, or, accord. to one relation thereof,
is prefixed to the latter word, governing it in
the gen. case: and IAth says, that it is a sort of
perfume: but some say that it is aloes-wood
(عُود, q. v.): [see also ظَفَارِىٌّ:] and others, a
well-known drug, of sweet odour, with which
women and infants are fumigated: (TA:) it is
diuretic, beneficial to the liver in a high degree,
and for the colic, and for worms, and the quartan
fever, as a beverage; and for rheum, and
defluxions, and pestilence, when the patient is
fumigated therewith; and for the [leprous-like
disorder called] بَهَق, and the [discolouration of the
face termed] كَلَف, when applied as a liniment;
(K;) and it confines the bowels, expels wind,
strengthens the stomach and heart, occasions
pleasurable sensation, is an ingredient in many
sorts of perfume, and is the best of perfumes in
odour when one fumigates therewith. (TA.)

-A2-  Equitable; just:
(S, * M, K:) an inf. n. used as an epithet, like
its syn. عَدْلٌ; (M, K;) and [therefore] applied

He maketh the portion of the means of subsistence
which is the share of any created being little, and

eighty-one dirhems. (TA.) Sometimes it is used

hence it is said in a trad., إِنَّ النِّسَآءَ مِنْ أَسْفَهِ السُّفَهَآءِ
إِلَّا صَاحِبَةَ القِسْطِ وَالسِّرَاجِ; (K;) the قِسْط being
here the vessel in which the وضوء is performed;

who serves her husband, and assists him to perform
the وضوء, [so I render تُوَضِّئُهُ,] and takes care of
the vessel which he uses for that purpose, and

أَقْسَطُ More [and most] equitable, just, or right:
occurring in the Kur, ii. 282, and xxxiii. 5:
