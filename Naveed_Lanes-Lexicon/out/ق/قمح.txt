قَمِحَهُ, (S, A, L, K,) aor.
قَمَحَ, (K,) inf. n.
قَمْحٌ; (S;) and ↓ اقتمحهُ; (S, A, L, K;) He
ate it, or took it into his mouth, (S, K,) namely,
meal of parched barley or wheat, &c., (S, A, L,)
not bread nor dates nor the like, but only what

اِسْتَفَّهُ; (S, K;) he took it in the palm of his hand
(A, L) [and conveyed it] to his mouth (A) or
licked it up. (L.) And قُمْحَةً مِنْهُ ↓ اِقْتَمَحْتُ [I
so ate a mouthful thereof, i. e. of what is eaten in
the manner described above]. (A.) ―
-b2-  And
↓ اقتمحهُ likewise signifies, (L, K,) as also قَمِحَهُ,
(L,) He drank it, namely, what is called نَبِيذ,
(L, K,) and شَرَاب [app. as meaning wine], and
water, and milk. (L.)
-A2-  And, from قَمِحَهُ
signifying as expl. above, you say, قَمَحَ عَنِ المَآءِ,
(A,) or [simply] قَمَحَ, (S, L, K,) with fet-h, (S,)
aor.
قَمَحَ, (L,) inf. n. قُمُوحٌ; (S, L, K;) as also قَمَهَ,
aor.
قَمَحَ, inf. n. قُمُوهٌ; (L;) and ↓ قامح, (A, L,)
inf. n. مُقَامَحَةٌ and قِمَاحٌ; (A;) and ↓ تقمّح, and
↓ انقمح; (S, L, K;) He (a camel) raised his
head (S, A, K) from the water (A) or at the
watering-trough, and refused to drink, (S, K,) his
thirst being satisfied, (S, A,) or by reason of
loathing, or of the coldness of the water, or of some
disease. (A.) And الإِبِلُ ↓ قَامَحَتِ The camels
came to the water and did not drink, (S, K,) but
raised their heads, (S,) by reason of disease, or of
cold, (S, K,) or of the coldness of the water, or
because their thirst was satisfied. (TA.) And
↓ شَرِبَ فَتَقَمَّحَ and ↓ انْقَمَحَ [He drank] and raised
his head and left drinking by reason of his thirst's
being satisfied. (S.) And فُلَانٌ مِنَ المَآءِ ↓ تقمّح
Such a one drank water, or the water, with
dislike, or loathing. (AZ.) ↓ أَشْرَبُ فَأَتَقَمَّحُ, said
by Umm-Zara, means (tropical:)  [I drink] and I satisfy
my thirst until I am not able to drink more, so I
raise my head like the [camel that is said to be]
مُقَامِح: (A, TA: *) Az says that التَّقَمُّحُ primarily
relates to water, but is metaphorically used by
her in relation to milk: she means that she
satisfied her thirst with milk until she raised her
head from drinking it like as does the camel when
he dislikes drinking water: (TA:) or, as some
relate her words, she said, فَأَتَقَنَّحُ, (A, TA, *)
which [likewise] means, “and I raise my head
in consequence of the being satisfied with drinking. ” (A.) [See also art. قنح.] ―
-b2-  قَمَحَ, aor.
قَمَحَ,
inf. n. قُمُوحٌ, is also expl. by Lth as signifying
He (a camel) became very languid by reason of
vehement thirst: but accord. to Az, this is wrong.
(L.)

قمّحهُ, (A, K,) inf. n. تَقْمِيحٌ, (K,) (tropical:)  He
repelled him (i. e. his companion, A) with a small
and paltry thing, in lieu of much that was due to
him; (A, K; *) like as the wronging commander
does to him who engages with him in a warring,
or warring and plundering, expedition, by doling
to him the least, or meanest, thing, and choosing
for himself in preference to him in the partition
of the spoil. (A, TA.)

Hence, (S, A,) شَهْرَا قِمَاحٍ, (S, A, K,) also called
↓ شَهْرَا قُمَاحٍ, (K,) The two coldest, (S, K,) or two
of the coldest, (A,) months (S, A, K) of winter;
(A;) said by Sh to be شِيبَانُ and مِلْحَانُ; (TA;
[in which it is also here said that they are the
two months whereof each is called كَانُون: if so,
corresponding to December and January O. S.:
but see شِيبَانُ, in art. شيب:]) so called because
the camels, when they come therein to water,
find its coldness hurtful to them, and therefore
raise their heads from it. (S.)

أُقْمِحَ, (MA,) [in my MS. copy of the
K indefinitely written اقمح, and in the CK
آقْمَحَ, but it is correctly أُقْمِحَ, as is shown by its
being added, after the explanation, in the TA,
“ whence ↓ مُقْمَحُونَ in the Kur ” (xxxvi. 7,] and
by explanations of this epithet in several of the
expositions of the Kur-án, and the like is also
indicated in the S,] inf. n. إِقْمَاحٌ, (S,) said of a
camel, (MA,) or of a man, and [in this case, but
not when said of a camel,] tropical, (TA,) He
raised his head, and contracted his eyes: (S,
MA, K, TA:) [or he was made to raise his head
and to contract his eyes:] it is expl. by Z as in
the K. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, (S,) أَقْمَحَهُ
الغُلُّ (tropical:)  The غُلّ [i. e. the ring, or collar, of iron,
for the neck, or the shackle for the neck and
hands, consisting of two rings, one for the neck
and the other for the hands, connected by a bar
of iron,] caused his (i. e. a captive's K) head to
be raised, by reason of the straitness thereof; (S,
K, TA;) meaning that the bar of the غُلّ, which
[by its projecting above the ring around the
neck] pricked his chin, did not let him lower his
head; as is said in the A. (TA.) ―
-b3-  الإِقْمَاحُ [as
inf. n. of أُقْمِحَ, like أُكْمِحَ (with ك and ح) in
form and in meaning,] also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The elevating of the head by reason of pride: and so
الإِكْمَاخُ. (L and TA in art. كمخ: but in the
CK, in that art, الاِقْماخُ, with خ.) And اقمح
بِأَنْفِهِ [i. e. أُقْمِحَ] signifies شَمَخَ [i. e. شَمَخَ بِأَنْفِهِ,
(assumed tropical:)  He magnified, or exalted, himself; was proud;
behaved proudly, or disdainfully; or elevated his
nose, from pride]; (K, TA;) and raised his
head, scarcely ever, or never, lowering it: as
though the verb had two contr. significations.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  اقمح said of thirst is expl. by Lth as
signifying It rendered a camel very languid: but
accord. to Az, this is wrong. (L.)
-A2-  اقمح
السُّنْبُلُ The ears [of wheat] became pervaded by
the farinaceous substance. (K.) ―
-b2-  And اقمح
البُرُّ, so in the T and L and other lexicons, but in
all the copies of the K البُرُّ ↓ اِقْتَمَحَ, The wheat
becomes mature قَمْح. (TA.)

قَمْحٌ Wheat, syn. بُرٌّ, (S, A, Mgh, L, Msb,
K,) and حِنْطَةٌ, and طَعَامٌ, (Msb,) when the
farinaceous substance pervades the ears, or from
the time when it has attained its full growth to
the time when it has become compact: (L:) [and
the grain of wheat; as also بُرٌّ and حِنْطَةٌ and
طَعَامٌ:] a word of the dial. of Syria. and sometimes used by the people of El-Hijáz; or, as
some say, a Coptic word; but the former assertion is the more correct: (TA:) the word بُرٌّ
is more chaste: (S in art. بر:) ↓ قَمْحَةٌ signifies
a single grain thereof. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  جَرَى القَمْحُ
فِى السُّنْبُلِ means The farinaceous substance pervaded the ears [of wheat]. (L.)

القِمْحَانَةُ The part between the قَمَحْدُوَة [or
occiput] and what is termed نُقْرَةُ القَفَا [which is
the small hollow in the back of the neck]. (K.)
القُمَّحَانُ, thus accord. to the Basrees, (TA,)
and القُمَّحَانُ, and ↓ القُمْحَةُ, (K,) The [plant
called] وَرْس [q. v.]: (S, K, TA:) or [the kind
of perfume called] الذَّرِيرَةُ: (TA:) or (so accord.
to the K and TA, but in the S “ also,”) a substance that comes upon the surface of wine, like
الذَّرِيرَة: (S, K, TA:) it is the froth, or scum,
thereof: (L, TA:) or, as some say, (TA, but in
the K “ and,”) saffron: (K, TA:) or a certain
perfume: or a white substance that overspreads
wine resembling الذَّرِيرَة: this last is said to be what
is meant in the following verse by En-Nábighah
[Edh-Dhubyánee], the only poet known by AHn
to have mentioned القمّحان:
إِذَا فُضَّتْ خَوَاتِمُهُ عَلَاهُ
يَبِيسُ القُمَّحَانِ مِنَ المُدَامِ
[When its seals are broken, what is exsiccated of
the white substance resembling particles of calamus
aromaticus of the wine comes, or appears, upon
its surface]. (L, TA.)
قُمَاحٌ, a subst. from قَمَحَ or قَامَحَ, Aversion of
a camel from drinking, by reason of the thirst's
being satisfied, or of loathing, or of the coldness
of the water, or of some disease. (L. [See also

قِمَاحٍ: see 3.
إِنَّهُ لَقَمُوحٌ لِلنَّبِيذِ Verily he is a great drinker
of the beverage called nebeedh. (ISh.)
قَمِيحَةٌ a subst. signifying What is eaten in the
manner termed اِقْتِمَاح, [see قَمِحَ,] (S, L,) of the
meal of parched barley or wheat, &c., (L,) or such
as a digestive stomachic (جُوَارِش [often written
جَوَارِش], &c.: (S:) expl. in the K by the word
جُوَارِش [only], in some copies with the addition
of a final ن [evidently a mistake for ت, since its
original in the Pers. گُوَارِشْ or گُوَارِشْت]: (TA:)
app. from القَمْحُ meaning البُرُّ. (S.) ―
-b2-  [Hence]
one says, مَا أَصَابَتِ الإِبِلُ إِلَّا قَمِيحَةً مِنْ كَلَأٍ (tropical:)  The
camels obtained not [aught] save somewhat of dry
herbage which they took into the mouth unmoistened, or licked up. (A, TA.)

refusing to drink, (S, K,) his thirst being satisfied,
(S, A,) or by reason of loathing, or of the coldness
of the water, or of some disease: (A:) and disliking water from any cause: (K:) and ↓ مُقَامِحٌ
signifies the same, applied to a he-camel, (As, S,
A,) and to a she-camel: (As, S, K:) pl. of the
former قُمَّحٌ; (S, K;) and of ↓ the latter قِمَاحٌ,
which is anomalous, (S,) or this is pl. of قَامِحٌ,
or it is [an inf. n.] syn. with مُقَامَحَةٌ, used as an
epithet; you say إِبِلٌ قِمَاحٌ; (A;) and إِبِلٌ
↓ مُقَامِحَةٌ. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also, (K,) as expl. by Lth,
and so ↓ مُقَامِحٌ, but, accord. to Az, wrongly, (L,)
A camel very languid by reason of vehement
thirst. (L, K.)
مُقْمَحُونَ: see 4, first sentence.
