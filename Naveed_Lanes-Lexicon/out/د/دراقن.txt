دراقندُرَاقِنٌ and دُرَّاقِنٌ, (K, and the latter is mentioned in one of my copies of the S,) the latter is
that which is in common use, (TA,) The peach;
syn. خَوْخٌ: (AHn, IDrd, K; and so in a copy
of the S:) and the apricot; syn. مِشْمِشٌ; (K;)
but this application of the words is not known:
(TA:) of the Syrian dial.: (K, and so in a copy
of the S:) IDrd says that the people of Syria
call the former fruit دراقن, which is an arabicized
Syrian word, or [rather] Greek, [originally
δωρά� degreesιον,] and El-Jawáleekee also mentions it
among arabicized words. (TA.)
