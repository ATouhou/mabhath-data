دنف1
دَنِفَ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
دَنَفَ, (Msb,
K,) inf. n. دَنَفٌ; (M, Msb;) and ↓ ادنف; (S, M,
Mgh, Msb, K;) or, accord. to Sb, one does not
say دَنِفَ, though they sometimes said دَنِفٌ, for
he regarded this as a possessive epithet; (M;)
said of a sick man, (S, Mgh, K,) He had a
constant, or chronic, disease: (Msb: [see دَنَفٌ,
below:]) or he was, or became, heavy, (S, Mgh,
K, TA,) by reason of disease, (Mgh, TA,) and
near to death, (Mgh,) or at the point of death:
(TA:) or he became emaciated by disease so as to
be at the point of death. (M.) ―
-b2-  And [hence,]
دَنِفَتِ الشَّمْسُ, and ↓ ادنفت, (tropical:)  The sun was near
to setting, and became yellow. (S, K, TA.) ―
-b3-
And دَنِفَ الأَمْرُ (tropical:)  The thing, or event, was, or
became, near (K, TA) to passing. (TA.)

ادنف: see 1, in two places.
-A2-  ادنفهُ, said of
a disease, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) It rendered him
constantly, or chronically, ill; or clave to him
constantly: (Msb:) or it rendered him heavy [so
that he was near to death, or at the point of
death: see 1]: (S, Mgh, K:) or, said of God,
He caused him to become emaciated by disease so
as to be at the point of death. (M.) Thus the
verb is trans. as well as intrans. (S, Msb.) ―
-b2-
And أَدْنَفْتُ الأَمْرَ (tropical:)  I caused the thing, or event, to
be near, or brought it near, (K, TA,) to passing.
(TA.)
دَنَفٌ A constant, or chronic, disease; (S, M,
K;) such as infects, or pervades, the person or the
inside: or, as some say, any disease, whatever it
be. (M.)
-A2-  Also, (S, M, K,) and ↓ دَنِفٌ, (S,
M, Msb, K,) the latter held by Sb to be a possessive epithet, as he disallowed the verb دَنِفَ, (M,)
A man having a constant, or chronic, disease;
(S, M, Msb, K;) such as infects, or pervades, his
person or his inside: or, accord. to some, having
any disease: or emaciated by disease so as to be
at the point of death: and ↓ مُدْنَفٌ and ↓ مُدْنِفٌ
signify the same: (M:) or these two signify
rendered heavy by disease [so as to be near to
death, or at the point of death: see 1]: (S, Mgh,
K:) [and Freytag adds ↓ دَانِفٌ, explained as
meaning “ interitui obnoxius,” as from the Ham;
in which I only find (p. 624) authority for دَنِفٌ,
signifying being at the point of death or destruction:] دَنَفٌ is used alike as masc. (Fr, T, S,
M, K) and fem. (S, M, K) and sing. (Fr, T, S,
M, K) and dual (S, M) and pl., (Fr, T, S, M,
K,) as though it were an inf. n. used as an
epithet: (M:) but if you say ↓ دَنِفٌ, you vary it
for the fem. and dual and pl., (T, * S, M, K,)
saying اِمْرَأَةٌ دَنِفَةٌ, (S, M,) &c., (S,) i. e., saying
also رَجُلَانِ دَنِفَانِ, (TA,) and قَوْمٌ أَدْنَافٌ, (M,) or
رِجَالٌ أَدْنَافٌ: (TA:) and sometimes دَنَفٌ has a
dual form and a pl.; (K;) [i. e.] one may say
أَخَوَاكَ دَنَفَانِ and إِخْوَتُكَ أَدْنَافُ. (Fr, T.) ―
-b2-
Applied to the sun, it means (tropical:)  Near to setting,
(M, TA,) and (TA) becoming yellow. (T, TA.)
So in the saying (of El-'Ajjáj, T, TA),
وَالشَّمْسُ قَدْ كَادَتْ تَكُونُ دَنَفَا
(tropical:)  [And the sun had almost become near to setting,
and to turning yellow]. (T, M, TA.) [See Q. 2
in art. زحلف.]
