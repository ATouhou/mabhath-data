دجن1
دَجَنَ, aor.
دَجُنَ, inf. n. دَجْنٌ and دُجُونٌ, It (a
day) was, or became, one in which the clouds
covered the sky: (S:) and دَغَنَ, inf. n. دُغُونٌ,
signifies the same, accord. to IAar. (TA. [See
also 4.]) ―
-b2-  دَجَنَتِ السَّحَابُ i. q. ↓ ادجنت [meaning The clouds rained continually]: (TA:) [for]
السَّمَآءُ ↓ ادجنت signifies the sky rained continually: (S, K:) [or دَجَنَتِ السَّحَابُ and ↓ ادجنت
may mean the clouds covered the sky, or the
regions of the sky, or the earth: for] ↓ الدَّجْنُ [is
app. the inf. n. of the former verb, and] signifies
the clouds' covering (S, M, K) the sky, (S,) or
the regions of the sky, (M, K,) or the earth.

inf. n. دُجُونٌ (S, Msb, K) and دَجْنٌ, (Msb,)
(tropical:)  He remained, stayed, dwelt, or abode, in the
place; (S, Msb, K, TA;) kept to it, or became
accustomed to it: (TA:) and so ↓ ادجن. (S,
Msb.) ―
-b4-  And hence, (TA,) دَجَنَ said of the
pigeon, and the sheep or goat, &c., (K, TA,) as,
for instance, the camel, (TA,) (tropical:)  It kept to the
house or tent. (K, TA.) ―
-b5-  And دَجَنَتْ لِلسِّنَاوَةِ

داجنهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُدَاجَنَةٌ, (S, M, TA,)
He endeavoured to conciliate him; treated him
with gentleness, or blandishment; soothed, coaxed,
wheedled, beguiled, or deluded, him; syn. دَاهَنَهُ:
(K:) in the S it is said that مُدَاجَنَةٌ is like مُدَاهَنَةٌ:
in the M, that it signifies the mixing in familiar,
or social, intercourse, or conversing, in a good
manner. (TA.) [Golius assigns to داجن another signification of داهن; namely “ He held in
contempt;” as on the authority of the KL; in
my copy of which it is not mentioned; nor can I
find it elsewhere.]

أَدْجَنَ see 1, in six places. ―
-b2-  ادجن also signifies
It (a day) became one of much rain; and so
↓ اِدْجَوْجَنَ: (K:) or the latter has a more intensive meaning, i. e. it became cloudy with mist
or vapour, and dark [with rain]; and [simply]
it became dark, or obscure. (TA. [See also 1,
first sentence.]) ―
-b3-  And ادجنو They entered
into [or upon a time of] much rain. (AAF, K.)

اِدْجَوْجَنَ: see the next preceding paragraph.
دَجْنٌ: see 1, second sentence: and see also
دُجُنَّةٌ [which has the same, or a similar, signification]. Accord. to Az, it signifies The shade of
the clouds in a day of rain. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also
Much, or abundant, rain: (AZ, S, Msb, K:)
pl. [of pauc.] أَدْجَانٌ and [of mult.] دُجُونٌ and
دُجُنٌ and دِجَانٌ. (K.) You say يَوْمُ دَجْنٍ and
يَوْمٌ دَجْنٌ and ↓ يَوْمُ دُجُنَّةٍ and يَوْمٌ دُجُنَّةٌ [app.
meaning, accord. to the K, A day of much, or
abundant, rain; but it seems to be indicated in
the S that the meaning is a day of clouds covering
the whole sky, full of moisture, and dark, but
containing no rain]: and in like manner one says
of the night [app. لَيلَةُ دَجْنٍ and لَيْلَةٌ دَجْنٌ as
well as ↓ لَيْلَةٌ دُجُنَّةٍ and لَيْلَةٌ دُجُنَّةٌ]: using the
latter word both as the complement of a prefixed
noun and as an epithet. (AZ, S, K.)
دُجْنٌ: see دُجُنَّةٌ.
دُجْنَةٌ [or ↓ دُجُنَّةٌ ?] Rain: so in the phrase
يَوْمٌ ذُو دُجْنَةٍ [or دُجُنَّةٍ ?] a day of rain; as also
ذُو دُغْنَةٍ [or دُغُنَّةٍ]. (TA.) ―

دُجُنٌّ: see the next paragraph, in three places.
دُجُنَّةٌ (AZ, S, K) and ↓ دِجِنَّةٌ and ↓ دُجُنٌّ (K)
Clouds covering the whole sky, full of moisture,
and dark, but containing no rain; (AZ, S, K;)
pl. ↓ دُجُنٌّ [or this is a coll. gen. n. of which دُجُنَّةٌ
is the n. un., though said to be syn. with this last,
as well as a pl.]: (K:) and darkness; syn.
ظُلْمَةٌ: or the first of these words (دُجُنَّةٌ) has this
last signification; i. e. ظُلْمَةٌ, or ظَلْمَآءُ; [thus in
some copies of the K and in the TA; but in
other copies of the K ظَلْمَآءُ only;] and is also
without teshdeed; (K;) i. e., it is also written
↓ دُجْنَةٌ, as in the “ Book ” of Sb: this is explained by Seer [and in the S] as syn. with ظُلْمَةٌ;
and, accord. to Sb, its pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]
is ↓ دُجْنٌ; but in the S it is said that its pl. is
دُجَنٌ, i. e. like صُرَدٌ, and دُجُنَاتٌ and دُجَنَاتٌ:
(TA: [but in one copy of the S, I find دُجْنٌ
and دُجْنَاتٌ; and in another, دُجَنٌ and دُجُنَاتٌ:])
and ↓ دُجُنٌّ is syn. with ↓ دَجْنٌ [q. v.]: (K, TA:
[in the CK, الدُّجُنُ is erroneously put for الدُّجُنُّ;
and الدَّجْنُ, which should immediately follow it,
is omitted:]) the pl. of دُجُنَّةٌ is دُجُنَّاتٌ. (TA.)

applied to a she-camel has this latter signification.

and some of the Arabs say دَاجِنَةٌ, (ISk, S,) applied to a sheep or goat (شَاةٌ), (ISk, S, Mgh, K,)
and a pigeon, (K,) &c., (ISk, S, K,) as, for instance, a camel, (TA,) (tropical:)  That keeps to the houses
or tents; (ISk, S, Mgh, K, TA;) domesticated,
or familiar, or tame: (ISk, S:) the first (داجن)
occurs in a trad. as meaning a sheep or goat
home-fed; that is fed by men in their places of
abode: (TA:) pl. دَوَاجِنُ; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;)
applied to sheep or goats and pigeons and the
like that keep to the houses or tents; (Msb; [in
which it is added that some say دَاجِنَةٌ;]) by ElKarkhee said to be contr. of سَائِمَةٌ; (Mgh;) and
applied by Lebeed to dogs used for the chase,
(S,) in this instance meaning trained, or taught:
(EM p. 164:) or دَاجِنٌ applied to a dog means
that keeps to the houses or tents; and so ↓ دَجُونٌ.
