دخدرQ. 1
دَخْدَرَ He gilded an earring: (K:) from
the noun following. (TA.)
دَخْدَارٌ A white, (S, K,) or black, (K,) garment,
or piece of cloth, (S, K,) which is laid up, or
preserved [in a chest, or wardrobe, whence its
name]: (S:) an arabicized word, originally
تَخْتْ دَارْ, (S, K,) which is Persian, and means
يُمْسِكُهُ التَّخْتُ, i. e. ذُو تَخْتٍ. (S.) [Golius, app.
misled by the words اصل تخت دار است, in the
KL of Ibn-Maaroof, probably corrupted in the
copy of that work used by him, adds to the explanation “ pannus albus ” &c., as from the work
above mentioned, “qui throno Regis Persici
quondam insterni solebat: inprimis Darii. ”] ―
