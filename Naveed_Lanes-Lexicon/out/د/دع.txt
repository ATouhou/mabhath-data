دَعَّهُ, aor.
دَعُ3َ, (S, Z,) inf. n. دَعٌّ, (S, K,) He
pushed him, thrust him, or drove him, away; he
repelled him: (S:) or he did so harshly, roughly,
or violently. (A'Obeyd, K.) Hence, in the Kur
[cvii. 2], فَذٰلِكَ الَّذِى يَدُعُّ اليَتِيمَ That is he who
pusheth, thrusteth, or driveth, away the orphan:
(S:) or, who doth so harshly, roughly, or violently: (Bd, Jel:) or, who treateth the orphan
with harshness, roughness, or violence; pushing,
thrusting, or driving, away; and chiding with
rudeness, or coarseness. (Z, TA.) And in like
manner, in the same [lii. 13], يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ إِلَى نَارِ
جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا On the day when they shall be pushed,
or thrust, or driven, with harshness, roughness, or
violence, to the fire of Hell. (A 'Obeyd, Bd,
Jel, TA.) And in a trad. of Esh-Shaabee, كَانُوا
لَا يُدَعُّونَ عَنْهُ They used not to be driven, nor
pushed, or repelled, from it. (TA.)
