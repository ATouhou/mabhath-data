درهمQ. 1
دَرْهَمَتْ, said of the خُبَازَى [or mallow],
(K, TA,) It became round [in its leaves]; (TA;)
its leaves became like [the silver coins called]
دَرَاهِم. (K.)
Q. 4
اِدْرَهَمَّ, (S, K,) inf. n. اِدْرِهْمَامٌ, (S,) He
(a man, TA) became aged: (K, TA:) or he (an
old man) tottered (سَقَطَ) by reason of age. (S,
TA.) ―
-b2-  ادرهمّ بَصَرَهُ His sight became dim, or
obscure. (K.)
دِرْهَمٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) of the measure فِعْلَلٌ,
(Msb, MF,) of which it has been said that there
are only three other instances, but there are
many more; (MF;) an arabicized word, (S,
Msb,) from the Pers. [دِرَمْ]; (S;) also pronounced ↓ دِرْهِمٌ, (S, Msb, K,) but this is of rare
occurrence; (TA;) and ↓ دِرْهَامٌ, (S, K,) which is
more rare; (TA;) A certain silver coin; (Mgh,
Msb;) like as دِينَارٌ signifies a certain gold coin:
(Mgh:) [and the weight thereof; i. e. a drachm,
or dram:] its weight is six دَوَانِيق [or dániks];
(Msb, and K in art. مك;) i. e., the weight of the
دِرْهَم إِسْلَامِىّ: but in the Time of Ignorance,
some dirhems were light, being four دوانيق; and
these were called طَبَرِيَّةٌ: and some were heavy,
being eight دوانيق; and these were called عَبْدِيَّةٌ,
or بَغْلِيَّةٌ: and of these two they made two that
were equal; so that each درهم was six دوانيق:
this is said to have been done by 'Omar: or,
accord. to another account, some dirhems were of
the weight of twenty carats, and were called the
weight of ten [i. e. of ten dániks]; and some were
of the weight of ten [carats], and were called the
weight of five; and some were of the weight of
twelve [carats], and were called the weight of six;
and they put the three weights together, and called
the third part thereof the weight of seven: and
one of the weights of the درهم before El-Islám
was twelve carats, which is six دوانيق: but the
درهم اسلامىّ is sixteen carats; the دانق of this
being a carat and two thirds: (Msb:) or dirhems
should be fourteen carats [i. e. seven dániks]; ten
being of the weight of seven مَثَاقِيل [or mithkáls]:
in the Time of Ignorance, some were heavy,
[equal to] مثاقيل; and some were light, [called]
طَبَرِيَّةٌ; and when they were coined in the age
of El-Islám, they made of the heavy and the light
two dirhems, so that ten became equal to seven
مثاقيل: A 'Obeyd says that this was done in the
time [of the dynasty] of the sons of Umeiyeh:
(El-Karkhee, cited in the Mgh:) [see also De
Sacy's “ Chrest. Arabe,” sec. ed., vol. ii. p. 110
of the Arabic text, and p. 282 of the transl.; where
it is further stated, on the authority of Ibn-Khaldoon, that the دِرْهَم مَغْرِبِىّ was three دوانيق; and
the يَمَنِىّ, one دانق; and, as is said in the Msb,
that 'Omar adopted the mean between the بغلىّ
and the طبرىّ, making the درهم to be six:] the
pl. (of درهم, S) is دَرَاهِمُ and (of درهام, S) دَرَاهِيمُ.
(S, K.) [The former of these pls. is often used
as signifying Money, cash, or coin, in an absolute sense.] The dim. is ↓ دُرَيْهِمٌ and ↓ دُرَيْهِيمٌ:
the latter held by Sb to be anomalous; for he
says that it is as though it were formed from
دِرْهَامٌ, though this was not used by them. (TA.)
―
-b2-  Hence, as being likened thereto, [i. e., to the
coin thus called,] (TA,) دِرْهَمٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  A
حَدِيقَة [app. as meaning a round piece of land
surrounded by a fence or the like, or by elevated
land; for this is one of the significations of
حَدِيقَةٌ]. (K.) [It is said that] this is taken from
the saying of 'Antarah, [describing shower of
copious rain,]
فَتَرَكْنَ كُلَّ حَدِيقَةٍ كَالدِّرْهَمِ
[So that they left every ridged-round spot of
ground like the درهم]. (TA.) [But accord. to
one reading, he said, كُلَّ قَرَارَةٍ; meaning, as is
said in the EM, p. 227, “every round hollow; ”
and likening such a hollow to the درهم because of
its roundness, and the clearness and whiteness of
its water.]
دِرْهِمٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
دِرْهَامٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
دُرَيْهِمٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
دُرَيْهِيمٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
مُدَرْهَمٌ A man possessing many دَرَاهِم: (AZ,
K:) it has no verb: (TA:) you should not say
دُرْهِمَ. (AZ, K.)
مُدْرَهِمٌّ An old man tottering (سَاقِطٌ) by reason
of age. (S, K.)
