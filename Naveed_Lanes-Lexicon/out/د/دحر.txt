دحر1
دَحَرَهُ, (S, A, K,) aor.
دَحَرَ, (K,) inf. n. دُحُورٌ
(S, A, K) and دَحْرٌ, (T, K,) He (God, S) drove
him away; expelled, or banished, him: he removed him; put, or placed, him at a distance, or
away, or far away: (T, S, A, K:) he pushed,
thrust, or repelled, him, (K,) with roughness, or
violence, and ignominy. (TA.) It is said, in a
form of prayer, اَلّٰهُمَّ ادْحَرْ عَنَّا الشَّيْطَانَ O God,
drive away from us the devil. (TA.)
دَحُورٌ: see what next follows.
دَاحِرٌ and ↓ دَحُورٌ Driving away; expelling, or
banishing: removing; putting or placing at a
distance, or away, or far away: pushing, thrusting, or repelling, (K,) [with roughness, or violence, and ignominy: see the verb.] In the Kur
[xxxvii. 8-9], some read وَيُقْذَفُونَ مِنْ كُلِّ جَانِبٍ
دَحُورًا, meaning [And they shall be darted at
from every side] with that which driveth away,
or expelleth, &c.; as though it were said بِدَاحِرٍ,
or بِمَا يَدْحَرُ: so says Fr; but he does not approve
of this reading. (TA.)
أَدْحَرُ More [or most] violently and ignominiously repelled. (TA from a trad., cited voce
أَدْحَقُ.)
مَدْحَرَةٌ [said in Har p. 210 to be syn. with the
inf. n. دُحورٌ signifies A cause, or means, of
driving away, &c.].
مَدْحُورٌ Driven, or removed, far away: so in
the Kur vii. 17 and xvii. 19. (S.) And hence,
الشَّيْطَانُ مَدْحُورٌ مِنْ رَحْمَةِ اللّٰهِ The devil is driven
away, or banished, from the mercy of God. (A.)
