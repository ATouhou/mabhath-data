دهليزدِهْلِيزٌ [An entrance-passage of a house; an
entrance-hall; a vestibule;] what is between the
[outer] door or gate and the house; (S, K;) the
place of entrance to a house: (Msb:) a Persian
word, (S, Msb,) originally داليج, and داليز, and
دالان, and, as some say, دَلِيجٌ, (Lth,) arabicized:
(Lth, S, Msb:) [also, in modern Arabic, an ante-
chamber: and the anterior apartment of a large
tent or pavilion: accord. to the MA, a large
tent: accord. to some copies of the K, i. q. جَيْئَةٌ:
accord. to some, خَنِيَّةٌ, which reading is preferred
by the author of the TK, who explains دهليز, from
the “Burhán,” as meaning “absurd words:”
accord. to some, حَنِيَّةٌ, which I think the right
reading, meaning a bowed, or curved, structure:
Golius seems to have found another reading in the
K, namely, حَيَّةٌ:] pl. دَهَالِيزُ. (S, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] أَبْنَآءُ الدَّهَالِيزِ (assumed tropical:)  Foundlings, (K, * TA,)
whose fathers are unknown. (TA.) [They are so
called because they are generally abandoned at
the entrances of mosques or private houses, whence
they are usually taken by persons who adopt
them.]
