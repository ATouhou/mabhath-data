(TA:) and إِدْهَانٌ [inf. n. of ↓ أَدْهَنَ] is like
تَدْهِينٌ. (AHeyth, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] دَهَنَ الأَرْضَ,
said of rain, (S, K,) (tropical:)  It moistened the ground
slightly, or a little: (S, TA:) or it moistened the
surface of the ground. (K.) ―
-b3-  And [hence also,]
دَهَنْتُهُ بِالعَصَا (S, K *) (tropical:)  I struck him (S, K, TA)
gently (TA) with the staff, or stick; (S, K, TA;)

with the staff or stick [some gentle strokes:
دَهَنَاتٌ being pl. of ↓ دَهْنَةٌ, which is the inf. n. of

from general analogy, دَهَنٌ,] said of a man, (assumed tropical:)  He
was, or became, weak: and also, foolish, or stupid:

syn. مُصَانَعَةٌ: (S, TA:) or the making peace with
another; or becoming reconciled with another:
(Msb:) or the pretending the contrary of, or what
is different from, that which one conceals in his
mind: (K:) and the former signifies also the
acting with dishonesty, or dissimulation: or ↓ the
latter has this signification; and the former signifies the striving to outwit, deceive, beguile, or
circumvent; syn. مُوَارَبَةٌ: (TA:) or دَاهَنْتُ signifies
I hid, concealed, or covered; syn. وَارَيْتُ [accord.
to four copies of the S; but probably this is a mistranscription for وَارَبْتُ, meaning I strove to outwit, deceive, beguile, or circumvent, as is indicated
in the TA]; and ↓ أَدْهَنْتُ signifies I acted with
dishonesty, or dissimulation: (S:) or ↓ إِدْهَانٌ is
[originally] like تَدْهِينٌ [as has been stated above]:
but is used as denoting the act of treating with
gentleness or blandishment, soothing, coaxing,
wheedling, beguiling, or deluding; and abstaining
from restraint or prohibition: (AHeyth, TA:) or
it originally signified the anointing such a thing
as a hide with some oil or the like: and as such a
thing is rendered soft to the sense [of feeling], it
was used tropically, or metaphorically, to denote
ideal softness, absolutely: hence, the treating
with gentleness or blandishment, soothing, coaxing,
wheedling, beguiling, or deluding, was termed
مُدَاهَنَةٌ: then this tropical signification became
commonly known, and conventionally regarded as
proper: and then the word [مداهنة or ↓ ادهان, or
rather each of these words,] was tropically used as
signifying the holding a thing in light, or little, or
mean, estimation, or in contempt: so in the
'Ináyeh. (MF, TA.) It is said in the Kur [lxviii.
9], ↓ وَدُّوالَوْ تُدْهِنُ فَيُدْهِنُونَ (tropical:)  They wish that thou
wouldst endeavour to conciliate [them], and in
that case they will endeavour to conciliate [thee]:
(S, TA: *) or that thou wouldst be soft, pliant, or
gentle, in thy religion, and in that case they will
be soft, pliant, or gentle: (TA:) or that thou
wouldst be soft, pliant, or gentle, to them, and in
that case they will be so to thee: (Jel:) or, accord.
to Fr, that thou wouldst be an unbeliever, and they
will be unbelievers. (TA.)

-b2-  الإِدْهَانُ is also syn. with
الإِبْقَآءُ, which, accord. to IAmb, is the primary
signification: in the copies of the K erroneously
written الإِنْقَآءُ. (TA.) One says, لَا تُدْهِنْ عَلَيْهِ,
meaning لَا تُبْقِ عَلَيْهِ [Show not thou mercy to
him; or pity not him; or pardon not him].
(IAmb, TA.) And مَا أَدْهَنْتَ إِلَّا عَلَى نَفْسِكَ, i. e.
