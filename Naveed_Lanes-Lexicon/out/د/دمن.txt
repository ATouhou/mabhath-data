دَمِىَ, (T, S, M, MA, Msb, K,) [held by
some to be originally دَمِوَ,] like رَضِىَ, (S, K,)
which is from الرِّضْوَانُ, being thus [with ى]
because of the kesreh, (S,) [but most hold the
last radical to be ى,] and دَمَى, (TA as from the
Msb, [but not in my copy of the latter work,])
aor. يَدْمَى, inf. n. دَمًا or دَمًى (T, S, M, MA,
Msb, K) and دُمِىٌّ, (S, MA, [but in the Msb it
seems to be indicated that it is دَمَىٌ,]) said of a

said of the arm or hand, (T,) It bled; blood
issued from it: (Msb:) [and] it was, or became,

↓ أَدْمَيْتُهُ, (S, M, K,) i. e. [I made him to bleed;]

from him: (S:) [and I made him bloody; for]
دَمَّاهُ signifies [also] he smeared him, or defiled

blood. (MA.) Hence the prov., وُلْدُكِ مَنْ دَمَّى
عَقَبَيْكِ, (M, TA,) Thy son is he who made thy two
heels to be smeared with blood; (TA in art. ولد;)

استدمى مَوَدَّتَهُ He looked, or watched, or waited,

دَمٌ [Blood;] one of the [four] أَخْلَاط [or
humours], (M,) well known: (T, M, K:) accord.
to some, (Msb,) it is originally دَمَوٌ: (S, Msb:)
or it is originally دَمًى; (Zj, Mbr, S, M, Msb,
K;) thus in the correct copies of the K; (TA;
[in some copies دَمْىٌ, and in the CK دَمَىٌ;])
though deviating from other words of the same
form in respect of its pl. [which see below];
(Mbr, S;) as is shown by its dual, (Zj, M,)
which is دَمَيَانِ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) whereby
[also] the letter gone from it is shown to be ى;
(Mbr, S;) but it has also for its dual دَمَانِ;
(T, M, Msb, K;) and some of the Arabs say
دَمَوَانِ; (S, M;) in which last, however, [accord.
to ISd,] the و is substituted for ى, though
generally و is changed into ى: (M:) and this
original form is used by a poet, [namely, Hoseyn
Ibn-El-Homám, accord. to one of my copies of
the S,] in his saying,
فَلَسْنَا عَلَى الأَعْقَابِ تَدْمَى كُلُومُنَا
↓ وَلٰكِنْ عَلَى أَقْدَامِنَا يَقْطُرُ الدَّمَى
[And we have not our wounds bleeding upon the
heels; but upon our feet the blood drops]: (S:)

is shown by its pls., (Sb, S,) which are دِمَآءُ (Sb,
T, S, M, K) and دُمِىٌّ, (Sb, S, M, K,) also pronounced دِمِىٌّ; (TA;) like as ظَبْىٌ and دَلْوٌ have
for their pls. ظِبَآءُ and ظُبِىٌّ and دِلَآءٌ and دُلِىٌّ; for
if it were like قَفًا and عَصًا, it would not have such
pls. (Sb, S.) دَمٌّ is ignored by Ks; but is used
by poetic license; (M;) or it is a dial. var. of دَمٌ.
(K in art. دم.) ↓ دَمَةٌ has a more special signification than دَمٌ, the two words being like بَيَاضَةٌ
and بَيَاضٌ; (S;) [i. e.] it signifies A portion of
blood: (T, M, K:) or it is a dial. var. of دَمٌ, (M,
K,) accord. to IJ. (M.) The dim. of دَمٌ is
↓ دُمَىٌّ. (S.) [Hence,] رَجُلٌ ذُو دَمٍ A man
seeking to obtain, or prosecuting for, [the revenge
of] blood. (TA.) دَمُ فُلَانٍ فِى ثَوْبِ فُلَانٍ is a
saying of the Arabs, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is the
slayer of such a one. (Ham p. 632.) الدَّمُ الدَّمُ
وَالهَدْمُ الهَدْمُ, or وَالهَدَمَ الهَدَمَ, is a saying of the
Arabs, meaning If thy blood be sought, my blood
shall be sought; and if thy blood go for nought,
my blood shall go for nought: or, accord. to the
latter reading, as is said in the Nh, and where
thou shalt be buried, I will be buried: or thine
abode shall be mine abode. (JM in art. هدم,
q. v.) See also an ex. voce دُمْيَةٌ. ―

senses]. (MA.)

of ivory and the like, (S,) or of marble, (M, K,)
variegated, decorated, embellished, or coloured,
(M, Mgh, K,) in which is redness like blood:
(Mgh:) or an image, or effigy, in a general
sense: (Kr, M, K:) accord. to Abu-I-'Alà, because originally painted with red, as though from
الدَّمُ: and any beautiful female is likened thereto,
because adorned: (TA:) metonymically applied
to (tropical:)  a woman: (IAar, T:) or anything that is
deemed beautiful in respect of whiteness: (TA:)
and an idol: (Lth, S, K:) said in the R to be so
called because of the shedding of blood at the
place thereof for the purpose of propitiation; but
MF says that this derivation requires consideration: more probably because it is decorated:
(TA:) pl. دُمًى. (S, Mgh, K.) Accord. to MF,
it is also pronounced ↓ دِمْيَةٌ. (TA.) One says,
أَحْسَنُ مِنَ الدُّمْيَةِ, meaning More beautiful than
the image of ivory. (Har p. 611.) And لَاوَ الدُّمَى
is an oath of the Pagan Arabs, meaning No, by
the idols: or, as some relate, it is ↓ لَا وَ الدِّمَآءِ
meaning No, by the blood of what is sacrificed
upon the stones set up to be worshipped: so in

red bay colour: (S, TA:) or of an intense red
colour like that of blood: (TA:) or intensely red
in the back [and] as far as the thin and soft
parts of the belly: and أَشْقَرُ مُدَمًّى of which the
sorrel colour is overspread, in its upper portion,
with a yellowness like the colour of the yellow [or
