دَامَ, aor. يَدُومُ and يَدَامُ; (S, M, Msb, K;)
the see. pers. of the pret. when the aor. is يَدُومُ
being دُمْتَ; and when the aor. is يَدَام, دِمْتَ;
(M;) and accord. to Kr, (M,) you say also
دِمْتَ, aor. تَدُومُ, which is extr., (M, K,) and not
of valid authority, held by the lexicologists [in
general] to be anomalous like مِتَّ having for its
aor. تَمُوتُ, and فَضِلَ of which the aor. is يَفْضُلُ,
and حَضِرَ of which the aor. is يَحْضُرُ, and said by
Aboo-Bekr to be a compound of the pret. of which
the aor. is تَدَامُ with the aor. of which the pret. is
دُمْتَ; (M;) inf. n. دَوْمٌ and دَوَامٌ [which is the
most common form] and دَيْمُومَةٌ [originally
دَيْوَمُومَةٌ, like قَيْدُودَةٌ originally قَيْوَدُودَةٌ, &c.];
(S, M, Msb, K;) i. q. ثَبَتَ [as meaning It (a
thing, S, M, Msb) continued, lasted, endured, or
remained]: (Msb, TK:) and it became extended,
or prolonged; syn. اِمْتَدَّ: (TK:) and [it continued,
lasted, endured, or remained, long;] its time was,
or became, long: (TA:) and i. q. بَقِىَ [as syn.
with ثَبَتَ (explained above) and as meaning it
continued, lasted, or existed, incessantly, always,
endlessly, or for ever; it was, or became, permanent, perpetual, or everlasting]: (Msb in art.
بقى:) and ↓ استدام signifies the same as دام [in
all of these senses]: (TA:) [but Mtr says,]
استدام السَّفَرُ [The journey continued, or continued
long,] is not of established authority. (Mgh.)
[Hence, دَامَ مُلْكُهُ May his dominion be of long
continuance.] And دام عَلَى الأَمْرِ; (MA;) and
عَلَيْهِ ↓ داوم, [and ↓ داومهُ, as is shown by a usage
of the act. part. n. in art. دمن in the S, &c.,]
(S, * MA,) inf. n. مُدَاوَمَةٌ; (S;) He kept continually, or constantly, to the thing, or affair.
(S, MA.) مَا دَامَ means Continuance; because ما
is a conjunct noun to دام; and it is not used
otherwise than adverbially, like as inf. ns. are
used adverbially: you say, لَا أَجْلِسُ مَا دُمْتَ قَائِمًا,
i. e., دَوَامَ قِيَامِكَ [I will not sit during the continuance of thy standing]; (S, TA;) [or as long
as thou standest; or while thou standest; for]
ما denotes time; and قُمْ مَا دَامَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا means
مُدَّةَ قِيَامِ زَيْدٍ [i. e. Stand thou during the period of
Zeyd's standing]. (Ibn-Keysán, TA.) [And
عَلَىالدَّوَامِ means Continually, or constantly;
like دَائِمًا.] ―
-b2-  Said of rain, it means It fell, or
descended, consecutively, continuously, or constantly. (Msb.) Some say, (M,) دَامَتِ السَّمَآءُ,
aor. تَدِيمٌ, inf. n. دَيْمٌ, (M, K,) which, if correct,
should be included in art. ديم, (M,) meaning The
sky rained continually; as also ↓ دَوَّمَت and
دَيَّمَت, (M, K,) in which last the و is changed into
ى as it is in دِيمَةٌ, (M,) and ↓ ادامت: (K:) or
rained such rain as is termed دِيمَة; (M in art.
ديم;) and so ↓ دَيَّمَت, inf. n. تَدْيِيمٌ; (S in art.
ديم;) and ↓ ادامت. (Z, TA.) [See also دَوْمٌ,
below.] IAar cites the following verse, (M, TA,)
by Jahm Ibn-Shibl, (TA in this art.,) or Ibn-Sebel, (TA in art. سبل, in which, also, the verse
is cited,) in praise of a horse, as is said in “ the
Book of Plants ” of Ed-Deenäwaree, and in
“ the Book of Horses ” of Ibn-El-Kelbee, not, as
J asserts it to be, in praise of a munificent
man, (TA,)
هُوَ الجَوَادُ بْنُ الجَوَادِ بْنِ سَبَلْ
جَادَ وَ إِنْ جَادُوا وَبَلْ ↓ إِنْ دَيَّمُوا
[He is the fleet, the son of the fleet, the son of
Sebel (a famous mare): if they are unremitting
in their running, (the masc. pl. being here used,
though relating to horses, in like manner as it is
used in the Kur xli. 20,) he is fleet; and if they
are fleet, he is vehement in his running]: or, as
some relate it, إِنْ دَوَّمُوا. (M, TA. [It should be
observed that the three verbs in this verse, and
the word سبل, also relate to rain.]) ―
-b3-  (tropical:)  It (a
thing, T) was, or became, still, or motionless; said
of water (T, S, * Msb, K, * TA) left in a pool by a
torrent, and of the boiling of a cooking-pot;
(Msb;;) and said, in this sense, of the sea: (M:)
and it stopped, or stood still. (T, TA.) ―
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  He
was, or became, tired, or fatigued: (T, TA:)
[app. because he who is so stops to rest.] ―
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  It
(a thing) went round, revolved, or circled: (T,
TA:) [app. because that which does so keeps
near to one place.] دَوَمَانٌ [an inf. n. of دَامَ like
as حَوَمَانٌ is of حَامَ,] signifies (tropical:)  The circling of a
bird (K, TA) around water. (TA. [But in my
MS. copy of the K, and in the CK, in the place
of الدَّوَمَانُ I find ↓ الدَّوَمَآءُ. See also 2.]) [Hence,]
دِيمَ بِهِ (tropical:)  He was taken, or affected, with a vertigo,
or giddiness in the head; as also بِهِ ↓ أُدِيمَ, (M,
TA,) and ↓ اُسْتُدِيمَ [app., in like manner, followed
by بِهِ]. (Z, TA.) ―
-b6-  دَامَتِ الدَّلْوِ, (K,) inf. n.
دَوْمٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  The bucket became full: (K:) in
this meaning, regard is had to the stagnant water
[in the bucket]. (TA.)
2
دَوَّمَتِ السَّمَآءُ, and دَيَّمَت: and دَيَّمُوا said of
horses: see 1, in the latter half of the paragraph,
in three places. ―
-b2-  دوّمت الكِلَابُ The dogs went
far: (Akh, IAar, M, K:) or continued their
course. (IAar, M.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says, (de
scribing a wild bull, T, TA,)
حَتَّى إِذَا دَوَّمَتْ فِى الأَرْضِ رَاجَعَهُ
كِبْرٌ وَ لَوْ شَآءَ نَجَّى نَفْسَهُ الهَرَبُ
[Until, when they went far in the land, pride
returned to him: but, had he pleased, flight had
saved his blood: J, however, assigns to the verb
in this instance another signification, as will be
seen below]. (M, TA.) ―
-b3-  دوّم said of a bird,
(T, M, K,) inf. n. تَدْوِيمٌ, (T, S,) (tropical:)  It circled
(Lth, T, S, M, K, TA) in the sky, (Lth, T, M, K,)
as also ↓ تداوم, (KL,) [or ↓ تَدوّم, (see مُتَدَوِّمَاتٌ,)]
to rise high towards the sky; (S;) as also ↓ استدام:
(M, K:) or circled in the sky, (M,) or flew,
(T, * K,) without moving its wings; (T, M, K;)
like the kite and the aquiline vulture: (T, TA:)
or put itself into a state of commotion in its
flying. (TA. [See also 1, near the end of the
paragraph.]) Dhu-r-Rummeh makes التَّدْوِيم to be
on the earth, or ground, in the verse cited above
in this paragraph; [as though the meaning were,
(assumed tropical:)  Until, when they went round &c.;] As disallows
this, and asserts that one says only دَوَّى فِىالأَرْضِ,
and دَوَّمَ فِى السَّمَآءِ; but some affirm that التَّدْوِيمُ
فِىالأَرْضِ is correct; and say that hence is de
rived ↓ الدُّوَّامَةُ, meaning “ the round thing [or
top] which the boy throws, and makes to revolve,
or spin, upon the ground, by means of a string; ”
though others say that this is so called from the
phrase دَوَّمْتُ القِدْرَ [explained below], because, by
reason of the quickness of its revolving, or spinning, it seems as though it were at rest: and
تَدْوَامٌ is like تَدْوِيمٌ: some, however, say that
تَدْوِيمُ الكَلْبِ signifies the dog's going far in flight:
(S:) AHeyth says that, accord. to As, التَّدْوِيمُ is
only the act of a bird in the sky: (T, TA:) AAF
says that, accord. to some, التَّدْوِيمُ is in the sky,
and التَّدْوِيَةُ is on the earth, or ground; but accord.
to others, the reverse is the case; and this, he
says, is the truth in his opinion. (M, TA. [See
also دَوَّىَ in art. دوى.]) ―
-b4-  You say also, دَوَّمَتِ,
الشَّمْسُ, (M, K,) or دوّمت الشمس فى السَّمَاءِ, (T,)
or فِىكَبِدِ السَّمَآءِ, (S,) i. e. دَارَتْ فِى السَّمَآءِ [or
دارت فى كبد السماء, lit. (tropical:)  The sun spun in the
sky, or in the middle of the sky; meaning, was as
though it were spinning]; (T, M, K;) or was as
though it were motionless [&c.]: (T, S:) and
hence is [said to be] derived the word ↓ دُوَّامَةٌ
applied to the boy's revolving, or spinning, thing.
(T.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says, (describing the [insect
called] جُنْدَب, [generally said to be a species of
locust,] TA in art. رمض)
مَعْرَوْرِيًا رَمَضَ الرَّضْرَاضِ يَرْكُضُهُ
وَالشَّمْسُ حَيْرَى لَهَا فِى الجَوِّ تَدْوِيمُ
(T, * S, TA) i. e. Venturing upon the [vehement]
heat of the pebbles, [meaning the vehemently-hot
pebbles,] striking them with its foot, for so the
جندب does, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  when the sun is [apparently]
stationary in the summer midday, [as though
perplexed in its course,] as though having a spinning [in the region between heaven and earth]:
(T, TA:) or as though it were motionless. (S.)
―
-b5-  And one says, دَوَّمَتْ عَيْنُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [His eye rolled;
i. e.] the black of his eye revolved as though it
were in the whirl of a spindle. (IAar, M, K.)
-A2-
[دوّم is also trans.] You say, دوّم الدُّوَّامَةَ, (M, K,)
inf. n. تَدْوِيمٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He made the دوّامة [or top]
to revolve, or spin [so as to seem to be at rest, as
has been shown above]: (M, K:) or he played
with the دوّامة. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And دوّمت الخَمْرُ شَارِبَهَا
(tropical:)  The wine intoxicated its drinker so as to make
him turn round about. (As, S, TA.) ―
-b3-  And
دَوَّمُوا العَمَائِمَ (assumed tropical:)  They wound the turbans around
their heads. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And دوّم المَرَقَةَ (assumed tropical:)  He put
much grease into the broth so that it swam round
upon it. (M, K.) ―
-b5-  التَّدْوِيمُ [or app. تَدْوِيمُ
اللِّسَانِ] also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The mumbling the tongue,
and rolling it about in the mouth, in order that
the saliva may not dry up: so says Fr. (S, TA.)
―
-b6-  [Hence, app., as the context seems to indicate,]
Dhu-r-Rummeh says, describing a camel braying
in his شِقْشِقَة [or faucial bag],
دَوَّمَ فِيهَا رِزَّهُ وَ أَرْعَدَا
[as though meaning (assumed tropical:)  He made his braying to
roll, or rumble, in it, and threatened]. (Fr, S,
TA.) ―
-b7-  And دوّم signifies (tropical:)  He moistened a thing.
(S, M, K.) Ibn-Ahmar says,
وَقَدْ يُدَوِّمُ رِيقَ الطَّامِعِ الأَمَلُ
(S, M;) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [And hope sometimes, or often,]
moistens the saliva [of the eager]: (S:) he is
praising En-Noamán Ibn-Besheer, and means
that his hope moistens his saliva in his mouth by
making his eulogy to continue. (IB.) ―
-b8-  (tropical:)  He
mixed, or moistened, or steeped, (دَافَ,) saffron,
(Lth, T, S, M, K, TA,) and stirred it round in
doing so: (Lth, T, TA:) he dissolved saffron in
water, and stirred it round therein. (A, TA.) ―
-b9-
دوّم القِدْرَ, and ↓ ادامها, (S, M, K,) He stilled the
boiling of the cooking-pot by means of some [cold]
water: (S:) or he sprinkled cold water upon [the
contents of] the cooking-pot to still its boiling:
(M, K:) or the former, (K,) or both, (M,) he
allayed the boiling of the cooking-pot by means of
something, (M, K,) and stilled it: (M:) and the
latter signifies he left the cooking-pot upon the
أَثَافِى [or three stones that supported it], after it
had been emptied, (Lh, M, K,) not putting it down
nor kindling a fire beneath it. (Lh, M.)

ادامهُ, (inf. n. إِدَامَةٌ, TA,) trans. of دَامَ; (S,

it to continue, last, endure, or remain: to be
extended, or prolonged: to continue, last, endure,
or remain, long: and to continue, last, or exist,
incessantly, always, endlessly, or for ever; to be
permanent, perpetual, or everlasting]: (TK:) he
did it continually, or perpetually: (MA:) he had
it continually, or perpetually. (MA, KL.) [Accord. to Golius, followed in this case by Freytag,
↓ تداوم signifies Perennitate donavit; a signification app. given by Golius as on the authority of
the KL; but not in my copy of that work.] ―
-b2-
ادام القِدْرَ: see 2, last sentence. ―
-b3-  ادام الدَّلْوَ (assumed tropical:)  He
filled the bucket. (K, TA.) ―
-b4-  الإِدَامَةٌ also signifies تَنْقِيرُ السَّهْمِ عَلَى الإِبْهَامِ [i. e. The trying the
sonorific quality of the arrow by turning it round
upon the thumb: or, as explained in this art. in
the TK, the making the arrow to produce a sharp
sound upon the thumb: or rather this or the
former is the meaning of إِدَامَةُ السَّهْمِ; for, as is
said in the TK, ادام السَّهْمَ signifies نقره على الابهام
(i. e. نقّرهُ)]. (T, K.)
-A2-  ادامت السَّمَآءُ: see 1, in

-A2-  As a
trans. v., (T,) i. q. اِنْتَظَرَ, (Sb, T, TA,) as also
↓ تدوّم, (K, [or this may perhaps be used only
without an objective complement expressed,]) and
رَقَبَ, (T,) or تَرَقَّبَ: (Sh, TA:) you say, اِسْتَدِمْ
كَذَا, meaning اِنْتَظِرْهُ and اُرْقُبْهُ (assumed tropical:)  [Look thou for,
expect, await, wait for, or watch for, such a
thing.] (T.) [When no objective complement is
expressed, it seems to mean (assumed tropical:)  He paused, and
acted with deliberation, or in a patient or leisurely
manner, or he waited in expectation; app. from
the same verb as syn. with دَوَّمَ; and thus, like one
who hovers about a thing: see حَوَّمَ; and see also
اِنْتَظَرَ.] And استدامهُ (tropical:)  He acted with moderation,
gently, deliberately, or leisurely, in it; (S, M, K,
TA;) namely, an affair, or a case: (S:) or he
sought, desired, asked, or demanded, its continuance, or long continuance, or endless continuance:
and so ↓ داومهُ (M, K, TA) in both of these
senses: (K, TA:) or he asked him to render a
thing continual &c.: (Mgh, Msb, TA:) and also
(assumed tropical:)  he acted gently and deliberately in it; namely,
an affair, or a case: (Msb:) and (assumed tropical:)  he acted gently
with him; (Fr, T in art. ديم, M, Msb, Kt;) i. e.,
another person, (Msb,) or his creditor; as also
اِسْتَدْمَاهُ, (Fr, T, M, K,) which we judge to be
formed from the former by transposition, because
we do not find it [in this sense] to have any inf. n.
(M.) A poet says, (T, S, Msb,) namely, Keys
Ibn-Zuheyr, (S,)
فَلَا تَعْجَلْ بِأَمْرِكَ وَاسْتَدِمْهُ
↓ فَمَا صَلَّى عَصَاكَ كَمُسْتَدِيمِ
(T, S, Msb,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [Therefore haste not in thine
affair, but act with moderation, gently, deliberately, or leisurely, therein]; for no one has
straightened thy staff by turning it round over the
fire, (T,) meaning, no one has managed thine affair
soundly, like one who acts with moderation, &c.
(T, Msb.) And another says, (S,) namely,
Mejnoon, (TA,)
وَإِنَّى عَلَى لَيْلَى لَزَارٍ وَإِنَّنِى
عَلَىذَاكَ فِيمَا بَيْنَنَا أَسْتَدِيمُهَا
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [And verily I am blaming Leylà; and
verily, notwithstanding that,] I look for her
aiding me by good conduct [in the matter that
is between us]. (S.) You say also, أَسْتَدِيمُ اللّٰهَ
نِعْمَتَكَ I seek, or desire, or ask, of God the
continuance, or long continuance, or endless continuance, of thy favour, or the like. (Mgh, TA. *)
And أَسْتَدِيمُ اللّٰهَ عِزَّكَ I ask God to continue, or
continue long, &c., thy might, or power, &c.
(Msb.) The phrase استدام لُبْسَ الثَّوْبِ, meaning
[He continued long the wearing of the garment,
or] he did not hasten to pull off the garment,
may be from the saying اِسْتَدَمْتُ عَاقِبَةَ الأَمْرِ,
meaning I looked, or watched, or waited, for the
end, or issue, or result, of the affair, or case.
(Msb.)
-A3-  Also He (a man) stooped his head,
blood dropping from it: formed by transposition
from اِسْتَدْمَى (Kr, TA.)
دَامٌ for دَائِمٌ: see the latter word.
دَوْمٌ an inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (S, M, Msb, K.) —
[Hence,] مَا زَالَتِ السَّمَآءُ دَوْمًا دَوْمًا The sky ceased
not to rain [in the manner of the rain termed
دِيمَة]; and so ↓ دَيْمًا دَيْمًا; (M, K; [in the CK,
erroneously, دِيْمًا دِيْمًا;]) in which the ى is interchangeable with the و; (M;) mentioned by AHn,
on the authority of Fr. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also دَائِمٌ,

-A2-  Also [The cucifera Thebaïca;
(Delile, “Floræ Ægypt. Illustr.,” no. 941;) or
Theban Palm; so called because abundant in the

gingerbread: accord. to Forskål, (under the
heading of “ Flora Arabiæ Felicis,” in his “ Flora
Ægypt. Arab.,” p. cxxvi.,) Borassus flabelliformis; a name applied (after him) by Sonnini to the
Theban palm; but now generally used by botanists
to designate another species of fan-palm:] the
tree of the مُقْل; (S, M, Msb, K;) a well-known
kind of tree, of which the fruit is [called] the
مُقْل: (TA:) n. un. with ة: AHn says that the
دَوْمَة [is a tree that] becomes thick and tall, and
has [leaves of the kind termed] خُوص, like the
خوص of the date-palm, and racemes like the
racemes of a date-palm. (M, TA.) Accord. to
Aboo-Ziyád El-Aarábee, (AHn, M,) The نَبِق
[which properly signifies the fruit of the سِدْر, but
here app. means, as it does in the present day, the
tree called سِدْر, a species of lote-tree, called by
Linn. rhamnus spina Christi, and by Forskal
rhamnus nabeca,] is also thus called, (AHn, M,
K,) by some of the Arabs: accord. to 'Omárah,
great [trees of the kind termed] سِدْر: (AHn, M:)
and, (M, K,) accord. to IAar, (M,) big trees of any
kind. (M, K.) [See also دَوْمَةٌ, below.]
دَيْمٌ, whence the saying مَا زَالَتِ السَّمَآءُ دَيْمًا دَيْمًا:
see دَوْمٌ.
دِيْمٌ: see دِيمَةٌ.
دَوْمَةٌ n. un. of دَوْمٌ. (M, TA.) [Also, app., as
in the present day, and as appears from what
follows, A single fruit of the tree called دَوْم.] ―
-b2-
And (assumed tropical:)  A testicle; (K;) as being likened to the
fruit of the دَوْم. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Golius also explains
it, as on the authority of the K, as meaning
“ Ebriosa mulier; ” and Freytag, as meaning
“ mulier vinum vendens: ” both are wrong: it is
mentioned in the K as the name of a woman who
sold wine.]
دِيمَةٌ A lasting, or continuous, and still rain:
(As, M, and TA voce ضَرْبٌ, q. v.:) or rain in
which is neither thunder nor lightning; the least
of which is the third of a day or the third of a
night; and the most thereof, of any period: (AZ,
S in art. ديم:) or rain that continues some days:
(Msb:) or rain that continues long and is still,
without thunder and lightning: (K, * TA:) or
rain that continues five days, or six, (M, K,) or
seven, (K,) or a day and a night, (T in art. ديم,
M, K,) or more; (T, TA;) or the least whereof
is a third of a day or of a night; and the most
thereof, of any period: (K, TA:) pl. دِيَمٌ, (S, M,
K,) the و being changed [into ى] in the pl.
because it is changed in the sing., (M,) and دُيُومٌ,
(Abu-l-'Omeythil, T, K,) and [coll. gen. n.] ↓ دِيْمٌ
(Sh, T, TA.) [See also مُدَامٌ.] ―
-b2-  Hence other
things are thus termed by way of comparison.
(S.) It is said in a trad. (S, M) of 'Áïsheh, (M,)
كَانَ عَمَلُهُ دِيمَةً (S, M, Msb) (assumed tropical:)  His work was
incessant [but moderate, or not excessive]; (Msb;)
referring to Mohammad; (T, S, M, Msb;) on her
being asked if he preferred some days to others:
(T:) she likened it to the rain termed ديمة in
respect of continuance and moderation. (T, M.)
And it is related of Hudheyfeh that he said,
mentioning فِتَن [i. e. trials, or probations, or
conflicts and factions, &c.], إِنَّهَا لَآتِيَتُكُمْ دِيمًا دِيمًا,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Verily they are coming to you]
filling the earth, or land, [and] with continuance. (T.)
دَامَآءُ (in the CK [erroneously] دَأْماءُ) The sea,
or a great river; syn. بَحْرٌ; (M, K;) because of
the continuance of its water: (M:) originally
دَوَمَآءُ, or دَوْمَآءُ: if the latter, the change of the و
into ا is anomalous. (TA.)
الدَّوَمَآءُ: see 1, near the end of the paragraph.
دَيْمُومٌ and دَيْمُومَةٌ, held by Aboo-'Alee to be
from الدَّوَامُ, and therefore to belong to the present
art.: (TA:) see art. دم.
-A2-  The latter is also an
inf. n. of دَامَ [q. v.]. (S, M, Msb, K.)
دُوَامٌ (tropical:)  A vertigo, or giddiness in the head; i. q.
دُوَارٌ (S, * M, * K, TA. [In the CK, دَواءٌ is erroneously put for دُوَارٌ.]) You say, أَخَذَهُ دُوَامٌ (tropical:)  [A
vertigo took him, or attacked him]. (S.) And
بِهِ دُوَامٌ (tropical:)  [He has a vertigo]. (As, TA.)
دُوَّامٌ: see what next follows.
دُوَّامَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  The فَلْكَة [or round thing, i. e. top,]
which the boy throws, and makes to revolve, or
spin, upon the ground, by means of a string:
(S, M, * K: *) the derivation of the word has been
explained above: see 2, in two places: (T, S:)

-b2-
دُوَّامَةُ البَحْرِ (assumed tropical:)  [The whirlpool of the sea; so in
the present day;] the middle of the sea, upon
which the waves circle (تدوم [i. e. تُدَوِّم]). (TA.)

sentence:)] continuing, lasting, enduring, or remaining, long: (TA:) [and continuing, lasting,
or existing, incessantly, always, endlessly, or for
ever; permanent, perpetual, or everlasting: (see,
again, 1, first sentence:)] and ↓ دَوْمٌ signifies the
same as دَائِمٌ, (S, M, K,) applied to shade; (S,
M;) being an inf. n. used as an epithet: (M:)
and ↓ دَيُّومٌ, also, (M, K,) [of the measure فَيْعُولٌ,
originally دَيْوُوِمٌ,] like قَيُّومٌ, (M,) signifies the
same as دائمٌ [app. in the last of the senses explained above; being of a form proper to intensive
epithets]: (M, K:) Lakeet Ibn-Zurárah says,
شَتَّانَ هٰذَا وَالعِنَاقُ وَالنَّوْمٌ
وَالمَشْرَبُ البَارِدُ وَالظِّلُّ الدَّوْمْ
[Different, or widely different, are this and
embracing and sleeping and the cool drinkingplace and the continual shade]. (IB, TA.) And
the Jews are related, in a trad. of 'Áïsheh, to have
said [to the Muslims], ↓ عَلَيْكُمْ السَّامُ الدَّامُ, meaning المَوْتُ الدَّائِمُ, [i. e. May everlasting death
come upon you; saying السَّامُ in the place of
السَّلَامُ, and] suppressing the ى [or rather the
hemzeh] because of [their desire to assimilate الدائم
to] السام. (TA.) [Hence دَائِمًا meaning Continually: and always, or for ever.] — Also (tropical:)  Still,
or motionless; said, in this sense, of water; (S,
M, Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) and so ↓ دَوْمٌ. (M, TA.)
— It is also said of that which is in motion, [as
signifying (assumed tropical:)  Going round, revolving, or circling,
(see 1,)] as well as of that which is still, or
motionless; thus having two contr. meanings:
so says Aboo-Bekr. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] ↓ مَرَقَةٌ
دَاوِمَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Broth into which is put much grease so
that this swims round upon it]: which is extr.,
because the و in this instance should by rule be
changed into a hemzeh. (M. [The meaning is
there indicated by the mention of this phrase
immediately after دَوَّمَ المَرَقَةَ, q. v.])
مَرَقَةٌ دَاوِمَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
دَيُّومٌ:see دَائِمٌ, first sentence.
أَدْوَمُ [More, and most, continual, lasting, &c.]
You say, هُوَ أَدْوَمُ مِنْ كَذَا [It is more continual,
or lasting, &c., than such a thing]: from الدَّوَامُ.
(IJ, M.)
مُدَامٌ Continual, or lasting, rain. (IJ, M, K.)
[See also دِيمَةٌ, above.] ―
-b2-  And Wine; as also
↓ مُدَامَةٌ: (T, S, M, K:) so called because it is
made to continue for a time (T, M) in the دَنّ,
(T,) or in its receptacle, (M,) until it becomes
still after fermenting: (T:) or because, by reason
of its abundance, it does not become exhausted:
(Sh, T:) or because of its oldness: (AO, T:) or
because it is the only beverage of which the
drinking can be long continued: (M, K:) or
because the drinking thereof is continued for days,
to the exclusion of other beverages. (A, TA.)
مُدَامَةٌ: see what next precedes.
مِدْوَمٌ and ↓ مِدْوَامٌ A stick, or piece of wood,
(M, K,) or some other thing, (M,) with which one
stills the boiling of the cooking-pot. (Lh, M, K.)
أَرْضٌ مَدِيمَةٌ, (Yz, S, M, K, TA, [in the CK,
erroneously, مُدِيمَةٌ,]) and ↓ مُدَيَّمَةٌ, (M, TA,)
Land upon which have fallen rains such as are
termed دِيِمٌ [pl. of دِيمَةٌ]. (Yz, * S, * M, K, * TA.)
مُدِيمٌ i. q. رَاعِفٌ (S, K) [Having blood flowing
from his nose: or, accord. to the PS and TK as
meaning having a continual bleeding of the nose].
أَرْضٌ مُدَيَّمَةٌ: see مَدِيمَةٌ.
مِدْوَامٌ: see مِدْوَمٌ.
مُتَدَوِّمَاتٌ, applied to birds, means Going round,
or circling, over a thing: and this is meant by
↓ مُتَدَاوِمَات, which is used for the former word,
in the saying [of a rájiz], describing horses,
كَالطَّيْرِ تَبْقِى مُتَدَاوِمَاتِهَا
i. e. Like birds when thou lookest at, or watchest,
those of them that are going round, or circling,
over a thing: (S, TA: *) or متدوّمات signifies
waiting, or watching. (TA.)
مُتَدَاومَاتٌ: see what next precedes.
مُسْتَدِيمٌ: see 10. Accord. to Sh, (TA,) it
signifies (assumed tropical:)  Exceeding the usual bounds in an
