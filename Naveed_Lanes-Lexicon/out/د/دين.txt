دين1
دَانَ, (IAar, S, K, TA,) aor. يَدِينُ, (IAar,
M, K, TA,) [inf. n. دِينٌ, (which see below,) in
this and most of the other senses, or the inf. n. is
دَيْنٌ, and دِينٌ is a simple subst.,] He was, or
became, obedient; he obeyed: (IAar, S, M, K,
TA:) this is the primary signification: or, as
some say, the primary signification is the following; namely, he was, or became, abased and
submissive: (IAar, * K, * TA:) or he was, or
became, abased and enslaved and obedient. (S.)
You say, دَانَ لَهُ, (S,) and دِنْتُ لَهُ and دِنْتُهُ, (M,
TA,) He, and I, was, or became, obedient to him
[&c.], or obeyed him [&c.]. (S, M, TA.) And
دِنْتُهُ, (M, K,) aor. أَدِينُهُ, (K,) I served him, did
service for him, or ministered to him, and acted
well to him. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] He became
[a servant of God, or] a Muslim. (TK.) You
say, دَانَ بِالْإِسْلَامِ, inf. n. دِينٌ, with kesr, [and
دِيَانَةٌ,] He became, or made himself, a servant of
God by [following the religion of] El-Islám;
[i. e. he followed El-Islám as his religion;] and
so ↓ تديّن. (Msb.) And دَانَ بِكَذا, (S,) and
دِنْتُ بِهِ, (M, K,) inf. n. دِيَانَةٌ [and دِينٌ]; and
به ↓ تديّن, [and تديّنتُ به; He, and I, followed
such a thing as his, and my, religion;] (S, TA;)
from دِينٌ as signifying “ obedience. ” (S.) And
دان بِدِينِهِمْ He followed them in their religion;
agreed with them, or was of one mind or opinion
with them, upon, or respecting, their religion;
took, or adopted, their religion as his. (TA.)
And the trad. of 'Alee, مَحَبَّةُ العُلَمَآءُ دِينٌ يُدَانُ
اللّٰهُ بِهِ [The love of the learned is a kind of
religion with which God is served]. (TA.) In
the phrase وَ لَا يَدِينُونَ دِينَ الحَقِّ [Nor follow the
religion of the truth, or the true religion], in the
Kur ix. 29, El-Islám is meant. (Jel.)
-A2-  Also
He was, or became, disobedient; he disobeyed:
and he was, or became, mighty, potent, powerful,
or strong; or high, or elevated, in rank, condition,
or state; noble, honourable, glorious, or illustrious.
(IAar, T, K.) Thus it bears significations contr.
to those mentioned in the first part of this paragraph. (MF.)
-A3-  Also, (S, M, Msb, K,) first
pers. دِنْتُ, (T, M8gh,) aor. as above, (T, S, Msb,)
inf. n. دَيْنٌ, (S, Msb,) from المُدَايَنَةُ, (Msb, [see
3,]) i. q. أَخَذَ الدَّيْنَ, (IKt, M, Msb, K,) or
[rather] أَخَذَ دَيْنًا, (T,) [He took, or received, a
loan, or the like; he borrowed: or he took, or
received, or bought, upon credit; which is the
meaning generally obtaining: and ↓ اِدَّانَ and
↓ أَدَانَ and ↓ استدان and ↓ تديّن signify [in like
manner] أَخَذَ دَيْنًا: (K:) or the first, i. e. دان,
signifies he sought, or demanded, a loan, or the
like; (ISk, S, Mgh, Msb;) as also ↓ ادّان and
↓ استدان: (S, Mgh:) and he became indebted, in
debt, or under the obligation of a debt: (S:) and
↓ ادّان and ↓ أَدَانَ and ↓ استدان signify أَخَذَ بِدَيْنٍ
[he took, or received, by incurring a debt; i. e. he
took, or received, or bought, upon credit; like
أَخَذَ دَيْنًا]; (M;) or the first and last of these
three signify أَخَذَ الدَّيْنَ, and اِقْتَرَضَ [which
means the same]: but ↓ أَدَانَ signifies he gave, or
granted, what is termed دَيْنٌ [meaning a loan, or
the like: or he gave, or granted, or sold, a thing
upon credit]: (TA:) accord. to Esh-Sheybánee,
this last verb signifies he became entitled to a
debt from others [or from another]: Lth says
that it (أَدَانَ) signifies he was, or became, such as
is termed مُسْتَدِينٌ; [i. e. it is syn. with استدان,
as it is said to be in the M and K;] but [Az
says,] this, which has been mentioned on the
authority of some one or more by Sh, is in my
opinion a mistake; أَدَانَ means he sold upon
credit; or became entitled to a debt from others
[or from another]; (T, TA;) or he sold to persons
upon a limited credit, or for payment at an
appointed period, so that he became entitled to a
debt from them: (S:) and accord. to Sh, ↓ ادّان
signifies he became much in debt. (T, TA.)
El-Ahmar cites the following verse of El-'Ojeyr
Es-Saloolee:
نَدِينُ وَيَقْضِى اللّٰهُ عَنَّا وَقَدْ نَرَى
مَصَارِعَ قَوْمٌ لَا يَدِينُونَ ضُيَّعِ
[We incur debt, and God pays for us; and
sometimes, or often, we see the places of overthrow
of a people, who incur not debt, in a state of
perdition]: in the S [and the T] ضُيَّعَا; but correctly as above; for the whole of the قَصِيدَة is
مَخْفُوضَة. (IB, TA.) And it is said in a trad.,
مُعْرِضًا ↓ اِدَّانَ, (S, K,) or, as some relate it, دَانَ,
(K,) He bought upon credit, or borrowed, or
sought or demanded a loan, of whomsoever he
could, addressing himself to such as came in his
way: (S, TA:) or both mean he bought upon
credit avoiding payment: or he contracted a debt
with every one who presented himself to him:
(K, TA: [see also other explanations voce
مُعْرِضٌ:]) ↓ ادّان signifies he bought upon credit:
(K:) or [thus and also] the contr., i. e. he sold
upon credit. (T, K.) ―
-b2-  It is also trans.; and so
is ↓ أَدَانَ. (Msb.) You say, دِنْتُهُ, (M, Mgh, K,
[in the CK دِينَةٌ is here put for دِنْتُهُ,]) inf. n.
دَيْنٌ; (TA;) and ↓ أَدَنْتُهُ (M, Mgh, K,) inf. n.
إِدَانَةٌ; (TA;) I gave him, or granted him, to a
certain period, what is termed دَيْنٌ [meaning the
loan, or the like; I lent to him: or I gave him,
or granted him, credit; or sold to him, upon
credit]: (M, K, TA:) so that he owed a debt:
(TA:) and i. q. أَقْرَضْتُهُ [I gave him, or granted
him, a loan, or the like]; (M, * Mgh, K;) as also
↓ دَيَّنْتُهُ: (Mgh:) or دِنْتُهُ has this last meaning:
(A 'Obeyd, S, M:) and ↓ أَدَنْتُهُ signifies I sought,
or demanded, of him a loan, or the like; syn.
اِسْتَقْرَضْتُ مِنْهُ; as also ↓ اِسْتَدَنْتُهُ: (M:) or دِنْتُهُ
has each of the last two meanings: (A 'Obeyd,
T, Msb:) and signifies also I received from him
a loan, or the like. (K.) And one says, ↓ أَدِنِّى
عَشَرَةَ دَرَاهِمَ meaning Lend thou to me ten dirhems.
(S, TA.)
-A4-  دانهُ, (S,) first pers. دِنْتُهُ, (M, Msb,
K,) inf. n. دِينٌ (S, M, K) and دَيْنٌ, (M, K,) or
the latter is the inf. n. and the former is a simple
subst., (M,) also signifies He repaid, requited,
compensated, or recompensed, him, (S, M, Msb,
K,) بِفِعْلِهِ for his deed: and so ↓ داينهُ, inf. n.
مُدَايَنَةٌ and دِيَانٌ. (M.) And دِنَّاهُمْ We did to
them like as they did to us. (Ham p. 10.) One
says, كَمَا تَدِينُ تُدَانُ, (T, S, M,) a prov., (M,)
meaning Like as thou repayest, or requitest, &c.,
thou shalt be repaid, or requited, &c.; (S, M;)
i. e. according to thy deed thou shalt be repaid,
or requited, &c.: (S:) or, as some say, like as
thou doest, it shall be done to thee: (M:) or like
as thou doest thou shalt be given, and repaid, &c.
(T.) And it is said in a trad., اَللّٰهُمَّ دِنْهُمْ كَمَا
يَدِينُونَنَا, meaning O God, repay them, or requite
them, &c., with [the like of] that which they do
to us. (TA.) ―
-b2-  اَللّٰهُ لَيَدِينُ مِنَ الجَمَّّآءِ لِلْقَرْنَآءِ, a
trad. of Selmán, means God will assuredly retaliate [for her that is hornless upon her that is
horned]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And one says, مَنْ دَانَ نَفْسَهُ
رَبِحَ, i. e. He who reckons with himself [gains]
(Ham p. 10. [Or the verb may here have the
meaning next following.])
-A5-  Also, دانهُ, He
abased him, (T, S, K,) and enslaved him. (T, S.)
Hence, (T,) it is said in a trad., الكَيِّسُ مَنْ دَانَ
نَفْسَهُ وَعَمِلَ لِمَا بَعْدَ المَوْتِ, (S, T,) i. e. [The
intelligent is] he who abases, and enslaves, himself
[and works for that which shall be after death]:
or, as some say, who reckons with himself: (T:)
or, accord. to some, who overcomes himself.
(TA.) And دانهُ, (K,) first pers. دِنْتُهُ, (T,)
signifies He made him to do that which he disliked. (AZ, T, K.) And دِينَ He was made to
do that which he disliked. (T.) ―
-b2-  And دِنْتُهُ,
inf. n. دِينٌ, I ruled, governed, or managed, him,
or it. (M, TA.) And I possessed it; owned it;
or exercised, or had, authority over it. (Sh, S,
K, TA.)
-A6-  دان, (IAar, T, K,) aor. يَدِينٌ, (K,)
[inf. n., app., دِينٌ, which see below,] signifies
also He became accustomed or habituated, or he
accustomed or habituated himself, to good or to
evil: (IAar, T, K:) and, accord. to Lth, (T,)
دِينَ signifies he was accustomed or habituated:
(T, M:) or, as some say, دِينٌ signifying “ custom,” or “ habit,” has no verb. (M.)
-A7-  And
He (a man, IAar, T) was, or became, smitten, or
affected, by a disease. (IAar, T, K.)
2
ديّنهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَدْيِينٌ, (S,
K,) He left him to his religion; (S, Mgh, Msb,
K;) left him and his religion, not opposing him
in that which he held allowable in his belief.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  He believed him: so in the saying,
ديّنهُ فِى القَضَآءِ [He believed him in respect of the
judgment, or judicial decision], (T, M, Mgh, *)
and فِيمَا بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ اللّٰهَ [in respect of what was
between him and God]: (T, M:) but this is a
conventional signification used by the professors.
(Mgh.) ―
-b3-  دَيَّنْتُ الحَالِفَ (T, TA) I confirmed
the swearer (قَوَّيْتُهُ [so in the TA, but in the T
بَرَّيْتُهُ, app. for بَرَّأْتُهُ, I held him, or pronounced
him, to be clear, or quit, if not a mistranscription
for قَوَّيْتُهُ,]) in that which he swore. (T, TA.)
-A2-  See also 1, in the latter half of the paragraph.
-A3-  دَيَّنْتُهُ القَوْمَ I made him ruler, governor, or
manager of the affairs, of the people, or company
of men. (M.) And ديّنهُ الشَّىْءَ, (T, * TA,) inf. n.
as above, (TA,) He made him to possess the
thing: to own it; or to exercise, or have, authority
over it. (T, * TA.) El-Hotei-ah says, (T, S, M,)
addressing his mother, (T,)
لَقَدْ دُيِّنْتِ أَمْرَ بَنِيكِ حَتَّى
تَرَكْتِهِمُ أَدَقَّ مِنَ الطَّحِينِ
(T, S, M,) meaning مُلِّكْتِ [i. e. Verily thou hast
been made to have the ordering of the affairs of
thy sons until thou hast rendered them finer than
flour]. (T, S.) And hence the saying, يُدَيَّنُ
الرَّجُلُ أَمْرَهُ i. e. يُمَلَّكُ [The man shall be made to
have the ordering of his affair, or affairs, or
case]. (Sh, T.)
3
دَايَنْتُهُ, (S, M, A, K,) inf. n. مُدَايَنَةٌ and
دِيَانٌ, (TA,) I dealt, or bought and sold, with him
upon credit; (A, TA;) I dealt, or sold and
bought, with him, giving upon credit and taking
upon credit: (S, TA:) or I lent to him; or I gave
him, or granted him, a loan, or the like; and he
did so to me: (M, K:) or I dealt with him upon
credit, giving or taking. (Ksh * and Bd in ii.
282.)
-A2-  See also 1, in the latter half of the paragraph.
-A3-  Each of the inf. ns. mentioned above is
also syn. with مُحَاكَمَةٌ [The summoning another
to the judge, and litigating with him: &c.].
(TA.)
4
ادان, inf. n. إِدَانَةٌ; as an intrans. v.: see 1,
in the former half of the paragraph, in three
places. ―
-b2-  As a trans. v.: see 1, in the latter half
of the paragraph, in four places. ―
-b3-  [The following
significations, namely, “Subegit,” and “ Pensavit,” assigned to this verb by Golius as on the
authority of the KL, and “ Voluit sibi esse servum,” and “ Servum cepit,” followed by an
accus., assigned to it by him as on the authority
of the S, I do not find in either of those works.]
5
تديّن: see 1, in the former half of the
paragraph, in three places.
6
تَدَايَنُوا They sold and bought, one with
another, upon credit; and in like manner تَدَايَنَا
is said of two persons: (S:) or they took, or
received, or bought, upon credit [app. one of
another]: and so اِدَّايَنُوا [which is a variation of
the former]. (M.) إِذَا تَدَيَنْتُمْ بِدَيْنٍ, in the
Kur ii. 282, means When ye deal, one with
another, (Ksh, Bd, Jel, Msb,) upon credit, giving
or taking, (Ksh, * Bd,) or by prepayment, (Jel,
Msb,) or lending or the like, (Jel,) &c. (Msb.)
8
اِدَّانَ, originally اِدْتَانَ: see 1, in six places.
10
استدان, as an intrans. v.: see 1, in the
former half of the paragraph, in three places. ―
-b2-
استدانهُ He sought, or demanded, of him what is
termed دَيْنٌ [meaning a debt]: and also i. q.
اِسْتَقْرَضَ مِنْهُ. (M.) See 1, in the latter half of the
paragraph.
دَيْنٌ [is an inf. n. of 1: ―
-b2-  and is also a simple
subst., and] properly signifies [A debt; such as]
the price of a thing sold [which the purchaser is
under an obligation to pay]; and a dowry
[which one engages to pay]: and a loan, or the
like; syn. قَرْض: (Msb:) or it is [a debt] such
as has an appointed time of falling due: what
has not such an appointed time is [properly, but
not always,] termed قَرْضٌ: (K:) and ↓ دِينَةٌ
signifies the same as دَيْنٌ (T, M, K) in the sense
above explained: (K:) a valid دَينْ (دَينٌ صَحِيحٌ)
is such as does not become annulled save by payment, or by one's being declared clear, or quit:
compensation in the case of a contract which a
slave makes with his owner to pay him a certain
sum as the price of himself and on the payment
thereof to be free is not a valid دَيْن, because it
may become annulled without payment, and
without his being declared clear, or quit; that is,
by the slave's being unable to pay it: (KT:) in
the language of the law, but not in the proper
language, دَيْنٌ is also applied to (assumed tropical:)  [a debt incurred
by] a thing taken unjustly, injuriously, or by violence; as being likened to a دَيْن properly so
called: (Msb:) and it signifies also anything that
is not present: [app. meaning anything to be paid,
or done, at a future time:] (M, K:) the pl. [of
pauc.] is أَدْيُنٌ (Lh, M, K) and [of mult.] دُيُونٌ
(S, M, K) [and in the CK is added and دِينَةٌ, with
kesr; but this is a mistranscription for دِنْتُهُ, as
syn. with أَدَنْتُهُ, which follows it, connected therewith by وَ]: the pl. of ↓ دِينَةٌ is دِيَنٌ. (TA.) You
say, مَا أَكْثرَ دَيْنَهُ and ↓ دِينَتَهُ [How great in
amount. is his debt!]; both meaning the same.
(AZ, T.) And ↓ جِئْتُ لِطَلَبِ الدِّينَةِ i. e. الدَّيْنِ
[I came for the demanding of the debt]. (AZ, T.)
And عَلَيْهِ دَيْنٌ [On him lies a debt; i. e. he owes
a debt]: and لَهُ دَيْنٌ [To him is due a debt; i. e.
he has a debt owed to him]. (S, TA.) And اِشْتَرَى
بِالدَّيْنِ [He bought upon credit]: (K:) and
أَخَذَ الدَّيْنَ (IKt, M, Msb, K) or [rather] أَخَذَ
دَيْنًا [signifies the same; or he took, or received,
upon credit: or he took, or received, a loan, or
the like; he borrowed]: (T, K:) and أَخَذَ بِدَيْنٍ
[likewise signifies the same; or he took, or received, by incurring a debt]. (M.) And بَاعَ
بِالدَّيْنِ [He sold upon credit]: (K:) and بِعْثُهُ
بِدَيْنٍ (TA) or ↓ بِدِينَةٍ (S) [I sold to him upon
credit]: and أَعْطَيْتُهُ الدَّيْنَ [signifies the same; or
I gave him, or granted him, credit: or I gave
him, or granted him, the loan, or the like].
(M, K, TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  Death; (K, TA;)
because it is a دَيْن [or debt] which every one
must pay when [the angel who is] the demander
of its payment comes. (TA.) And hence the
prov., رَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ بِدَيْنِهِ (tropical:)  [May God smite him
with his death]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Thaalebeh Ibn-'Obeyd
says, describing palm-trees,
تَضَمَّنُ الحَاجَاتِ العِيَالِ وَ ضَيْفِهِمْ
وَمَهْمَا تَضَمَّنْ مِنْ دُيُونِهِمْ تَقْضِ
[They comprise the wants of the household and
of their guest; and whatever they comprise of
their debts, they pay]; by the دُيُون meaning
what is obtained of their fruit that is gathered.
(M, TA.)
دِينٌ [is an inf. n. of 1: and is also used as a
simple subst., signifying] Obedience; (T, S, M,
K;) as also ↓ دِينَةٌ: (K: [in the M it is said,
without any restriction, that دِينَةٌ is like دِينٌ:])
this is its primary meaning: and its pl. is أَدْيَانٌ:
or, as some say, its primary meaning is that next
following: (TA:) a state of abasement, (M, K,
TA,) and submissiveness. (TA.) الدِّينُ لِلّٰهِ means
Obedience to, and the service of, God. (T, K. *)
And the saying, in the Kur [iv. 124], وَ مَنْ أَحْسَنُ
دِينًا مِمَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلّٰهِ means [And who is
better] in obedience [than he who resigns himself
to God?] (Er-Rághib, TA.) In like manner,
also, in the same [ii. 257], لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِى الدِّينِ
means [There shall be no compulsion] in obedience. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―
-b2-  A religion: (K, and
in one of my copies of the S:) pl. as above: (S:)
so termed as implying obedience, and submission
to the law: [for ex.,] it is said in the Kur [iii. 17],
إِنَّ الدِّينَ عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ الْإِسْلَامُ [Verily the only true
religion in the sight of God is El-Islám]. (TA.)
الدِّينُ is a name for That whereby one serves
God. (S, * K.) [It is applied to Religion, in the
widest sense of this term, practical and doctrinal:
thus comprehending الإِيمَانُ, which means “ religious belief. ”] And it [particularly] signifies
[The religion of] El-Islám. (M, K.) And The
religious law of God; consisting of such ordinances as those of fasting and prayer and pilgrimage and the giving of the poor-rate, and the
other acts of piety, or of obedience to God, or of
duty to Him and to men; syn. الشَّرِيعَةُ. (TA.)
And The belief in the unity of God. (K.) And
Piety, or pious fear, and abstinence from unlawful things; syn. الوَرَعُ. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  Also A
particular law; a statute; or an ordinance; syn.
حُكْمٌ (K, and Jel in xii. 76) and قَضَآءٌ [which
signifies the same as حُكْمٌ]. (Katádeh, T, K.) It
is said in the Kur [xii. 76], مَا كَانَ لِيَأْخُذَ أَخَاهُ فِى
دِينِ الْمَلِكِ, meaning He (Joseph) was not to
take his brother as a slave for the theft according
to the law of the king of Egypt; i. e., فِى حُكْمِ
مَلِكِ مِصْرَ, (Jel,) or فىقَضَائِهِ; (Katádeh, T;)
for his punishment according to him was beating,
and a fine of twice the value of the thing stolen;
not enslavement: (Jel:) or, accord. to ElUmawee, the meaning is, in the dominion of the
King. (T.) ―
-b4-  [A system of usages, or rites and
ceremonies &c., inherited from a series of ancestors.] It is said in a trad., of the Prophet,
كَانَ عَلَى دِينِ قَوْمِهِ, meaning He used to conform with the old usages obtaining among his
people, inherited from Abraham and Ishmael, in
respect of their pilgrimage and their marriagecustoms (IAth, K, TA) and their inheritances
(IAth, TA) and their modes of buying and selling
and their ways of acting, (IAth, K, TA,) and
other ordinances of the faith [&c.]; (IAth, TA;)
but as to the belief in the unity of God, they had
altered it; and the Prophet held no other belief
than it: (IAth, K, TA:) or, as some say, the
meaning here is, their dispositions, in respect of
generosity and courage; from دِينٌ in the sense
next following. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Custom, or habit;
(AZ, T, S, M, K;) as also ↓ دِينَةٌ: (M, * TA:)
and business: (S, TA:) pl., as above, أَدْيَانٌ.
(M, TA.) This, also, has been said to be the
primary signification. (TA.) One says, مَا زَالَ
ذٰلِكَ دِينِى That has not ceased to be my custom,
or habit. (T, TA.) ―
-b6-  A way, course, mode, or
manner, of acting, or conduct, or the like. (K.)
―
-b7-  I. q. تَدْبِيرٌ [app. as meaning Management,
conduct, or regulation, of affairs]. (K.) ―
-b8-  State,
condition, or case. (S, M, K.) ISh says, I asked
an Arab of the desert respecting a thing, and he
said to me, لَوْ لَقِيتَنِى عَلَى دِنٍ غَيْرِ هٰذِهِ لَأَخْبَرْتُكَ
[Hadst thou found me in a state other than this,
I had informed thee]. (S, M.) ―
-b9-  A property,
such as is an unknown cause of a known effect;
syn. خَاصِّيَّةٌ. (KL. [The significations of “ Via ”
and “ Signum ” and “ Opera,” mentioned by
Golius as from the KL, I do not find in my copy
of that work.])
-A2-  Disobedience. (S, K.) [Thus
it bears a signification the contr. of that first
mentioned in this paragraph.]
-A3-  Repayment, requital, compensation, or recompense: (S, M, K:)
or, as some say, such as is proportioned to the
deed of him who is its object. (TA.) Hence,
مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ, i. e. [The King] of the day of
requital, in the Kur [i. 3]: (M, T, TA:) or the
meaning in this instance is the next but one of
those here following. (T, TA.) ―
-b2-  Retaliation,
by slaying for slaying, or wounding for wounding,
or mutilating for mutilating. (TA.) ―
-b3-  A reckoning. (T, S, M, K.) [See the sentence next but
one above.] Hence, in the Kur [ix. 36], ذٰلِكَ
الدِّينُ القَيِّمُ [is said to mean] That is the right,
correct, or true, reckoning. (T, TA.)
-A4-  Compulsion against the will: (K:) subdual, subjection,
or subjugation; ascendency: sovereign, or ruling,
power; or power of dominion: (S, K:) mastership, or ownership; or the exercise, or possession,
of authority. (K, TA.)
-A5-  A disease: (Lh, IAar,
T, S, M, K:) or, accord. to El-Mufaddal, an old
disease. (IAar, T.)
-A6-  [It is said to signify also]

(K:) accord. to the book of Lth, [by which is
meant the 'Eyn,] (T,) rain that has been constantly, (T,) or usually, (K,) recurring in a place:
(T, K:) but this is a mistake of Lth, or of some
one who has added it in his book: a verse of Et-
Tirimmáh, there cited as an ex., ends with وَدِينِ,
which is in that instance syn. with مَوْدُون, meaning “ moistened; ” its و being the primal radical,
not the conjunction وَ; and دِينٌ as meaning any
kind of rain being unknown. (T, TA.)
