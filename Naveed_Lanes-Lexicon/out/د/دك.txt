دَكَّ, aor.
دَكُ3َ, (S,) inf. n. دَكٌّ, (S, K,) He
broke, or crushed, in any manner; or bruised,
brayed, or pounded; i. e., beat with a thing so
as to break or crush; i. q. دَقَّ. (S, K.) He
threw down, pulled to pieces, or demolished. (K.)
He broke a wall, and a mountain. (Lth, TA.)
He beat a thing and broke it so as to lay it even
with the ground. (S.) Hence the saying in the
Kur [lxix. 14], فَدُكَّتَا دَكَّةً وَاحِدَةً, (S,) i. e.
And they shall be beaten together with one beating, and the whole shall become fine dust: or
they shall both be spread with one spreading,
so as to become an even ground. (Bd.) [For]
دَكَّ الأَرْضَ, (TA,) inf. n. as above, (K, TA,)
means He made even the elevations and depressions of the earth, or ground. (K, TA.) أَذَا
دُكَّتِ الأَرْضُ دَكًّا, in the Kur [lxxxix. 22], means
When the earth shall be made level, without
hills, (Ibn-'Arafeh, Bd,) and without mountains:
or it means, shall become fine dust scattered:
(Bd:) or shall be shaken so that every building
thereon shall be demolished and non-existent.
(Jel.) See also دَكٌّ below. ―
-b2-  دَكٌّ also signifies
The spreading (كَبْس [for which كَنْس is erroneously put in the CK]) of earth, and making it
even. (K.) When a roof, or flat house-top, has
been spread with earth (كُبَِسَ بِالتُّرَابِ), one says,
دُكَّ التُّرَابُ عَلَيْهِ [Earth was spread upon it]:
and دَكَّ التُّرَابَ عَلَى المَيِّتِ, inf. n. دَكٌّ, means
He poured earth upon the corpse. (AZ, AHn.)
―

earth; and so ↓ دَكْدَكَةٌ. (TA.) You say,
دَكَكْتُ الرَّكِىَّ I filled up the wells with earth:
(S:) and الرَّكِىَّ ↓ دَكْدَكَ He filled up the wells
with earth. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And دَكَّهُ signifies also
He pushed him, or thrust him; like صَكَّهُ and
لَكَّهُ. (As, TA.) ―
-b5-  [Hence,] دَكَّ جَارِيَتَهُ (tropical:)  He
(a man) distressed his young woman, or female
slave, by throwing his weight upon her when
desiring to compress her. (AA, TA. [See also
رَكَّ.]) And دَكَّ الدَّابَّةَ بِالسَّيْرِ (tropical:)  He distressed, or
jaded, or fatigued, the beast by journeying.
(TA.) And دُكَّ الرَّجُلُ, (S, K,) i. e. دَكَّتْهُ الحُمَّى,
(AZ, S,) or دَكَّهُ المَرَضُ, (K,) meaning (tropical:)  Fever,
or disease, weakened the man: (TA:) or he
became sick, or ill. (K.) ―
-b6-  And دَكٌّ also signifies The sending forth camels all together. (Ibn-
'Abbád, TA.)

دكّكهُ He mixed it; namely, colocynth
with dates or some other thing. (O, L, K.) You
say, دَكِّكُوا لَنَا Mix ye for us. (L, O.) [See
مُدَكَّكٌ.]
6
تداكّ عَلَيْهِ القَوْمُ The people pressed, or
crowded, upon him. (TA.) It is said in a trad.
of 'Alee, ثُمَّ تَدَاكَكْتُمْ عَلَىَّ تَدَاكُكَ الإِبِلِ الهِيمِ
عَلَى حِيَاضِهَا, i. e. Then ye pressed [upon me like
the pressing of thirsty camels upon their wateringtroughs]. (TA.) And one says, تَدَاكَّتْ عَلَيْهِمُ
الخَيْلُ The horses, or horsemen, pressed upon
them. (TA.)

R. Q. 1
دَكْدَكَ, inf. n. دَكْدَكَةٌ: see 1, in
two places. ―
-b2-  One says of the stallion-camel
when he covers, يُدَكْدِكُ النَّاقَةَ [app. meaning
He distresses the she-camel by his weight: see
دَكَّ الجَارِيَتَهُ, above]. (Ibn-'Abbád, TA.)
R. Q. 2
تَدَكْدَكَثِ الجِبَالُ The mountains became دَكَّاوَات, i. e. hills of mould or clay. (S.)
دَكٌّ An even, or a level, place; (K;) [and so
↓ أَدَكُّ, as is shown by an explanation of its fem. in
this paragraph:] or land, or ground, broken, and
made even: (S:) you say أَرْضٌ دَكٌّ: (Akh, S:)
pl. دُكُوكٌ. (S, K.) Hence, in the Kur [vii. 139
and xviii. 98], جَعَلَهُ دَكًّا, (Akh, S, TA,) i. e.
[He made it, in the former instance, and shall
make it, in the latter instance,] even, or level,
(AZ, Az, Ibn-'Arafeh,) without any hill: (Ibn-
'Arafeh: [this addition relating to the former
instance:]) or crumbled: (Ksh, * Bd:) or, accord.
to Akh, دَكًّا may be here an inf. n.; as though
the meaning were ↓ دَكَّهُ دَكًّا: [see 1:] or it may
be elliptical, meaning جَعَلَهُ ذَا دَكٍّ: another
reading is ↓ جَعَلَهُ دَكَّآءَ, (S,) meaning in the
former instance a hill rising from the ground like
the دَكَّةَ: (Ksh:) or meaning جَعَلَهُ أَرْضًا دَكَّآءَ,
(S,) i. e. He made it even, or level, ground;
(Ksh, Bd;) because the word جَبَل [to which
دكّآء virtually relates] is masc. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also, [as
a subst.,] Even, or level, sand; and so ↓ دَكَّةٌ: pl.
[of either, agreeably with analogy,] دِكَاكٌ. (K.)
―
-b3-  And A [mound, or hill, of dust or earth, such
as is called] تَلّ: (K:) or the like of a تَلّ: (L:)
in some of the copies of the K, التكّ is erroneously
put for التّل. (TA.)
دُكٌّ A low mountain: (S, K:) or an elevated,
or overlooking, hill of mould, or clay, in which is
somewhat of ruggedness: (As, TA:) pl. دِكَكَةٌ;
(As, S, K;) and دِكَكٌ [app. another, though
irregular, pl. of the same,] is said to signify
قِيرَان [i. e. small isolated mountains, or knolls of
mountains, &c., (see قَارَةٌ,)] breaking, or crumbling,
down: or disintegrated [hills, or mountains, such
as are called] هِضَاب. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [See also أَدَكُّ,
of which it is a pl.]
-A2-  Also Strong and bulky.
(Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
دَكَّةٌ A certain thing, (S,) [i. e.] an elevated
place, (Msb,) a flat-topped structure, (K,) upon
which one sits; (S, Msb, K;) i. q. مَسْطَبَةٌ [a
kind of wide bench, of stone or brick &c., generally built against a wall]: (Msb:) pronounced
by the vulgar ↓ دِكَّةٌ [and commonly applied by
them to a long seat of wood]: (TA:) and
↓ دُكَّانٌ signifies the same; (S, Msb, K;) but
accord. to some, this belongs to art. دكن [q. v.]:
(S, Msb, TA:) the pl. of the former is دِكَكٌ, like
as the pl. of قَصْعَةٌ is قِصَعٌ: (Msb:) and the pl.
of ↓ دُكَّانٌ is دَكَاكِينُ. (TA.) [For another
modern application, see مَحْفِلٌ.] ―
-b2-  See also دَكٌّ.
دِكَّةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph. ―
-b2-

أَدَكُّ.]

bruised, or crushed. (TA.)
دُكَكَةٌ A thing [meaning food] made of هَبِيد

(TA,) and a day, (K,) Complete. (S, K.)
دَكَّآءُ, fem. of أَدَكُّ [q. v.], used as a subst.,
(TA,) A hill of mould or clay, (As, S, M, K,)
not rugged, (As, M, K,) nor amounting to a
mountain: (TA:) or the pl. signifies natural
[mounds, or hills, of dust or earth, such as are
called] تِلَال: (TA:) the pl. is دَكَّاوَاتٌ, (As, S,
M, K,) because it is used as a subst.: (TA:) or
it has no sing.: (K:) ISd says, this is what the
lexicologists say; but in my opinion the sing. is
دَكَّآءُ. (TA.)
دُكَّانٌ: see دَكَّةٌ, in two places: and see also
art. دكن.
دَكْدَكٌ and دِكْدِكٌ: see what next follows.
دَكْدَاكٌ (As, S, K) and ↓ دَكْدَكٌ and ↓ دِكْدِكٌ

أَدَكُّ, and its fem. دَكَّآءُ: see دَكٌّ. You say also
أَكَمَةٌ دَكَّآءُ, meaning A hill wide [and app. flat,
or nearly so,] in its top: (TA:) or an expanded
hill: (Msb:) pl. دَكَّاوَاتٌ, which is extr. in this
case, because دكّآء is here an epithet. (TA.)
And دُكٌّ, [its regular pl.,] applied to sands, Even
and compact. (AHn, M in art. ذلف.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
A horse contracted [in make] and broad in the

S to be like حُمْرٌ and حَمْرَاوَاتٌ, but one does not
say حَمْرَاوَاتٌ, like as one does not say أَحْمَرُونَ:
(IB:) and in like manner the masc. is applied to
a he-camel: (K:) or دَكَّآءُ [in the sense here explained] has no masc., and therefore it is allowable to say دَكَّاوَاتٌ. (IB.)
مِدَكٌ (tropical:)  A strong man, that treads the ground
vehemently: (S, TA:) or strong to work; (K;)
and the fem., with ة, is applied in this latter sense
