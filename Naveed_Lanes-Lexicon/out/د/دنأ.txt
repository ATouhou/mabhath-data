دنأ1
دَنَأَ, aor.
دَنَاَ; and دَنُؤَ, aor.
دَنُاَ; inf. n. دَنَآءَةٌ,
(AZ, Lh, T, S, M, Msb, K,) of the former verb,
and of the latter also, (AZ, Lh, T, M,) and دُنُوْءٌ,
of the former, (Fr, T,) or of the latter, (AZ, T,)
and [of the latter] دُنُوْءَةٌ; (S, K;) He (a man)
was, or became, low, ignoble, or mean, in his
actions; and cared not for what he did, nor for
what was said to him: (ISk and T in explanation
of the former verb, and S in explanation of both
verbs:) or the former verb, (AZ, T,) or each,
(Lh, T, M, K,) he was, or became, bad, corrupt,
or foul, in respect of the belly and the genital
member [i. e. in respect of appetite for food and
for sexual enjoyment]; not caring for what he
did, nor for what was said to him: (AZ, Lh, T,
M, K:) and the former verb, (S) or each, (M,
K,) [accord. to some,] he was, or became, such as
is termed دَنِىْءٌ, i. e. خَسِيسٌ [app. as meaning
contemptible]; (S, M, K;) like دَنَا, aor. يَدْنُو,
inf. n. دَنَاوَةٌ; (Msb;) and destitute of good:
(S:) but some make a distinction between the
verbs with ء and the verb without ء; saying that
the meaning “ he was, or became, خسيس ” is that
of دنا, without ء; (T, Msb;) and the truth is,
that the verbs with ء have the meanings assigned
to them by AZ and Lh; (T;) or signify he was,
or became, low, ignoble, or mean: (Msb:) or
these two verbs also signify, (K,) or signify as
some say, (M,) he was one in whom was little or
no good; contemned or contemptible, mean,
paltry, or of no weight or worth. (M, K.)

دَنِىْءٌ (AZ, Lh, T, S, M, Msb, K) and ↓ دَانِئٌ,
(Lh, T, S, * M, K,) applied to a man, Low,
ignoble, or mean, in his actions; not caring for
what he does, nor for what is said to him:
(S:) or bad, corrupt, or foul, in respect of the
belly and the genital member [i. e. in respect of
appetite for food and for sexual enjoyment]; not
caring for what he does, nor for what is said to
him: (AZ, Lh, T, M, K:) and [accord. to some,]
i. q. خَسِيسٌ [app. as meaning contemptible]; (S,
M, K;) like دَنِىٌّ, without ء; (Msb;) and destitute of good: (S:) but some make a distinction
between دَنِىْءٌ and دَنِىٌّ; saying that the latter
means خسيس; (T, Msb;) and the former, as
explained by AZ and Lh; and this is the truth;
(T;) or that دَنِىْءٌ means لَئِيمٌ [i. e. low, ignoble,
or mean, as contr. of كَرِيمٌ]: (Msb:) دَنِىْءٌ is
also applied to an action: (M, K: * [see 4:]) and
signifies likewise, (K,) or as some say, and so
↓ دَانِئٌ, (M,) one in whom is little or no good;

أَدْنَآءٌ, (K, TA,) like أَشْرَافٌ pl. of شَرِيفٌ, (TA,)
and دُنَآءٌ, (K,) which is anomalous, (TA,) or
دُنَأءُ. (M.)
دَنِيْئَةٌ A low, or base, quality, property, natural
disposition, habit, practice, or action; syn. نَقِيصَةٌ;
(S, K;) or such as is blamed; also pronounced
دَنِيَّةٌ. (TA in art. دنو, q. v.)
دَانِئٌ: see دَنِىْءٌ, in two places.
أَدْنَأُ [More, and most, low, ignoble, or mean,
in his actions; &c.]. You say, هُوَ أَدْنَأُ مِنْهُ [He
is more low, &c., than he]. (Zj, T.) Fr says
that أَدْنَى in the Kur ii. 58 is [for أَدْنَأُ,] derived
from دَنَآءَةٌ: accord. to one reading, it is أَدْنَأُ.
(TA.)
