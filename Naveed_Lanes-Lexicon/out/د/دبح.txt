دبح2
دبّح, inf. n. تَدْبِيحٌ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,). said
of a man, (S, Msb, &c.,) He stretched out his
back, and lowered his head, (As, S, Msb, * K,)
so that his head was lower than his posteriors;
(As, S, Msb; *) as also ↓ اندبح; (K;) and so
دبّخ, [q. v.,] with خ: (Msb:) the doing thus in
inclining the body in prayer, like as the ass does
[when he is mounted], is forbidden in a trad.:
(S, Msb:) i. e. he lowered his head in inclining
his body in prayer so that it was lower than his
back: (A'Obeyd, Msb:) or he lowered his head,
and raised his posteriors, in prayer: (TA:) or

as also دبّخ [q. v.]: (T, TA:) or he did so in
walking: (TA:) or he bent his back; (Lh, T,
Msb, TA;) as also دبّخ; with which As says
that دنّخ, with ن and خ, is syn.: (Msb:) and
دبّح ظَهْرَهُ signifies he (a man) bent his back, raising the middle of it as though it were a camel's
hump: erroneously related by Lth with ذ. (T,
TA.) ―
-b2-  Also He (a boy, in play,) lowered his
back in order that another might come running
from a distance and mount upon him. (Aboo-
'Adnán, TA.) And one says, دَبِّحْ لِى حَتَّى أَرْكَبَكَ,
meaning Stoop for me in order that I may mount
upon thee. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, said of an ass having
a sore back, He relaxed his legs, and lowered his
back and rump, by reason of pain, on being
