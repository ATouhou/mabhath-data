دَفَئِىٌّ, (T, S, M, K,) also termed دَثَئِىٌّ, (As,
IAar, S, K,) but this latter is not of established
authority, and is not mentioned in the M nor in

the heat has acquired strength; (M, K in art.
دثأ, TA;) when the earth has put (lit. vomited)
forth the كَمْأَة [or truffles, which, accord. to

period of the auroral setting of the Tenth Mansion
of the Moon, (which happened, about the commencement of the era of the Flight, in that part,
on the 11th of February O. S.,) when the sharpness of winter is broken, and the trees put forth
their leaves: see also 1 in art. نتج]: (Lth, IAar,
Th, M:) or the rain that is after [that called]
the رَبِيع[q.v.], before, (قَبْل, as in one copy of
the S, in another قبل without any syll. signs,)

called] the صَيْف[q. v., see also نَوْءٌ], when
the كَمْأَة disappear entirely from the earth:
(S, O, TA:) AZ says that the beginning of the
دَفَئِىّ is وُقُوعُ الجَبْهَةِ and the end is الصّرْفَةُ [i. e.
the period extends from the auroral setting of
the Tenth Mansion of the Moon (about the 11th
of February O. S. as explained above, when the
sun in Arabia has begun to have much power,)
to about the 9th of March O. S.: see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ,

نَوْءٌ]. (S, TA.) ―

(AZ, T, S, M, K,) whatever it be, that is brought
(AZ, T, S) before, (قبل, written without any
syll. signs in a copy of the S, and قبلَ in the
CK,) or in the first part of, (قُبُل, as in the M
and TA and in a copy of the S and in one of the
K, [and this appears to be the right reading,] in
a copy of the T قِبل,) the صَيْف [here meaning
spring]: (AZ, T, S, M, K:) this is the third
ميرة; [see this word for an explanation of the
statement here given;] the first being that called
the رِبْعِيَّة[q. v.]; and the second, that called the
صَيْفِيَّة[q. v.]: then comes the دفئيّة; and then,
the رَمَضِيَّة, which comes when the earth becomes
burnt [by the sun]. (M.) ―
-b3-  And in like manner
also, (AZ, S,) i. e., by the term دَفَئِىٌّ is also
meant, (M,) The نِتَاج [or offspring] (AZ, S, M)
