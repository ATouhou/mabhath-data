درى1
دَرَى الشَّىْءَ He knew the thing; syn. عَلِمَهُ;
(M;) [and so دَرَى بِالشَّىْءِ; for] you say, دَرَيْتُهُ
(S, Msb, K) and دَرَيْتُ بِهِ, (S, K,) aor. أَدْرِى, (Msb,
K,) inf. n. دَرْىٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and دِرْىٌ (Lh,
M, K) and دِرْيَةٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and دَرْيَةٌ, (M, *
K,) which last is said by Sb to be not used as an
inf. n. of un., but as denoting a state, or condition, (M,) and, accord. to some copies of the
S, دُرْيَةٌ, (TA, [so in one of my copies of the S,])
and دِرَايَةٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and دَرَيَانٌ and دِرْيَانٌ
(M, K) and دُرِىٌّ, (TS, K,) I knew it; (S, Msb,
K;) syn. عَلِمْتُهُ (Msb, K) or عَلِمْتُ بِهِ: (S:) or
it has a more special meaning than عَلِمْتُهُ: it is
said to signify I knew it after doubting: so says
Aboo-'Alee: (TA:) or I knew it by a sort of
artifice, or cunning, or skill; (K, TA;) or with
painstaking, and artifice or cunning or skill;
(Har p. 24;) and therefore دَرَى is not said of
God: (TA:) a rájiz says, (S, * TA,) but this is
an instance of the rude speech of the Arabs of
the desert, (TA,)
↓ لَا هُمَّ لَا أَدْرِى وَأَنْتَ الدَّارِى
[O God, I know not, but Thou art the knowing]:
(S, TA: [in Har, p. 24, it is cited as commencing
with اَلّٰهُمَّ, and therefore as a prose-saying,
ascribed to Mohammad, and as adduced by some
to show that الدَّارِى is allowable as an epithet
applied to God:]) or, as some relate it, لَا أَدْرِ,
(S,) in which the ى is elided in consequence of
the frequent usage of the phrase; (S, M;) like
the phrases لَمْ أُبَلْ and لَمْ يَكُ; (S;) and like
لَا يَأْلُ in the saying أَقْبَلَ بِضَرْبَهٍ لَا يَأْلُ [q. v. in
art. الو]. (M.) [The saying لَا دَرَيْتُ وَلَا ائْتَليْتَ
or أَلَيْتَ &c. is explained in the latter part of
the first paragraph of art. الو.] One says,
مَا أَدْرِى أَىُّ النَّاسِ هُوَ [I know not who of mankind
he is]. (The Lexicons passim.) And IAar mentions the saying مَا تَدْرِى مَا دِرْيْتُهَا, (M,) or دُرَيْتُهَا,
(TA,) as meaning Thou knowest not (مَا تَعْلَمُ
[which may also be rendered she knows not])
what is her knowledge. (M, TA.)
-A2-  دَرَى, (T,
M, K,) aor. يَدْرِى, (T, S,) inf. n. دَرْىٌ, (T, M, K,)
He deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or
outwitted, (ISk, T, S, M, K,) a man, (ISk, T,)
and an object of the chase; as also ↓ اِدَّرَى and
↓ تدرّى: (T, S, M, K: [ادْراهُ in the CK is a
mistake for ادّراهُ:]) he hid, or concealed, himself,
and deceived, deluded, &c. (S.) A rájiz says,
↓ كَيْفَ تَرَانِىأَذَّرِى وَأَدَّرِى
غِرَرِى ↓ غِرَّاتِ جُمْلٍ وَتَدَرَّى
(T, S, M) i. e. How seest thou me winnowing the
dust of the mine and deceiving Juml by looking
at her while she is inadvertent, (T, S,) she also
deceiving me [by looking at me while I am inadvertent]: تَدَرَّى being for تَتَدَرَّى. (S.) See
also 3.
-A3-  دَرَى رَأْسَهُ, (K,) aor. يَدْرِى, inf. n. دَرْىٌ,
(TA,) He scratched his head with the مِدْرَى:
(K:) or رَأْسَهُ ↓ درّى he combed his head with the
مِدْرَى: (M: [see Ham p. 159, line 11: and see
also ذَرَّىَ:]) and ↓ تَدَرَّتْ she (a woman, S) loosed
and let down, or loosed and separated, or combed,
her hair (S, K, TA) with the مِدْرَاة. (TA.)

-b2-  دَرَّيْتُ تُرَابَ
المَعْدِنِ, inf. n. تَدْرِيَةٌ, [I winnowed the dust of the
mine to separate its gold: a dial. var. of ذَرَّيْتُ:
or perhaps a mistake for the latter.] (Msb.)

Mgh, Msb,) He treated him with gentleness, or
blandishment; soothed, coaxed, wheedled, or cajoled, him: (S, * M, Msb:) or deceived, deluded,
beguiled, circumvented, or outwitted, him; or
strove, endeavoured, or desired, to do so: (T,
Mgh:) مُدَارَاةُ النَّاسِ and مُدَارَأَةُ النَّاسِ both signify المُدَاجَاةُ and المُلَايَنَةُ: (S in the present
art.:) and دَارَأْتُهُ and دَارَيْتُهُ both signify I was
fearful, or cautious, of him; and treated him
with gentleness or blandishment, or soothed him,
coaxed him, wheedled him, or cajoled him: (S in
art. درأ:) or دَارَأْتُهُ means “ I was fearful, or
cautious, of him,” as says AZ; or “ of his evil,
or mischief: ” and دَارَيْتُ signifies I deceived,
deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or outwitted; as
also ↓ دَرَيْتُ: (T in art. درأ:) and مُدَارَاةٌ also signifies [the acting with] good nature or disposition; and the holding familiar intercourse with
others. (T in the present art.) You say also,
داراهُ عَنِ الأَمْرِ, and عَلَيْهِ, He endeavoured to turn
him, or entice him, by blandishment, or by deceitful arts, from the thing, and to it; syn. رَاوَدَهُ.
(L in art. رود.) ―

him; or spoke, or pleaded, or contended, in
defence of him; like رَاجَمَ عَنْهُ. (TA in art. رجم.)
4
ادارهُ بِهِ He made him to know, or have
knowledge of, it; acquainted him with it. (S,
M, Msb, K.) The reading وَلَا أَدْرَأَكُمْ بِهِ, with ء,
[in the Kur x. 17,] is incorrect: the proper
reading is without ء. (S, M.)
-A2-  ادرى دَرِيَّةً, and
↓ تدرّى, (M, TA,) He took for himself, or prepared, a دريّة. (TA.) [See also تَدَرَّأَ.]

-A3-  and see also 4.
-A4-  جَيْشٌ
يَتَدَرَّى [as though for يَتَدَرَّأُ] An army of which
one part presses upon another; like يَتَجَعْبَى.

-b2-  اِدَّرَوْ مَكَانًا
means They directed their course to, or towards,
a place, making an inroad, or incursion, upon an

inf. n. of دَرَيْتُهُ meaning عَلِمْتُهُ, like دِرْيَةٌ &c. (TA.)

(ISk, T,) or a she-camel, or a cow, (M,) by
means of which one conceals himself from the
objects of the chase, or wild animals, (As, ISk,
T, S, M,) so deceiving them, (ISk, T, M,) shooting,
or casting, when he is able to do so: (As, ISk,
T, S:) or, accord. to AZ, it is with ء, [دَرِيْئَةٌ,]
because the دريئة is driven (تُدْرَأُ, i. e. تُدْفَعُ,)
towards the objects of the chase. (S, M.) ―
-b2-
Also A wild animal, or wild animals, (وَحْش,)

kesr to the ر, (TA, [in the CK, erroneously,
مِدْرِيَة,]) An iron instrument with which the head
is scratched, called [in Pers.] سَرْ خَارَهْ; (T;) a
thing like a large needle, with which the female
hair-dresser adjusts, or puts in order, the locks
of a woman's hair; (S;) a thing with which the
head is scratched: (W p. 125, in explanation of

explanation of the second:) and, (T, S,) as being

copies of the K, a comb: (TA:) the pl. is مَدَارٍ
and مَدَارَى, (M, K, TA,) in the latter of which,
the alif [written ى] is a substitute for ى [properly so called]. (M, TA.) [Hence,] جَأْبٌ المِدْرَى,
or جَابُ المدرى (accord. to different copies of
the S, [or جَأْبَةُ المِدْرَى, or جَأْبَةُ المدرى, see arts.
