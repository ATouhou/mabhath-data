دخل1
دَخَلَ, (S, K, &c.,) aor.
دَخُلَ, (TA,) inf. n.
دُخُولٌ (S, Msb, K) and مَدْخَلٌ, (S, K,) He, or
it, entered; or went, came, passed, or got, in;
contr. of خَرَجَ; (K;) as also ↓ اِدَّخَلَ, of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ, and ↓ اندخل, (S, K,) this last occuring in poetry, but not chaste, (S,) and ↓ تدخّل,
(K,) or this signifies it (a thing) entered by little
and little. (S, O.) You say, دَخَلْتُ مَدْخَلًا حَسَنًا
[like دُخُولًا حَسَنًا I entered with a good entering].
(S.) And دَخَلْتُ البَيْتَ (S) or الدَّارَ, i. e. [I entered the house, or] I became within the house,
and the like, (Msb,) correctly meaning إِلَى البَيْتِ
[&c., or فِى البَيْتِ &c., i. e. I entered into the
house, &c.], the prep. being suppressed, and the
noun put in the accus. case after the manner of
an objective complement: for nouns of place are
of two kinds, vague and definite; the vague being
such as the six relative locations, خَلْفٌ, and قُدَّامٌ,
and يَمِينٌ, and شِمَالٌ, and فَوْقٌ, and تَحْتٌ, and the
like, such as أَمَامٌ, and وَرَآءٌ, and أَعْلَى, and أَسْفَلُ,
and عِنْدَ, and لَدُنْ, and وَسْطٌ in the sense of بَيْنٌ,
and قُبَالَةٌ, all which, and similar nouns of place,
may become adverbs, because indefinite; for dost
thou not see that what is خَلْف to thee may be
قُدَّام to another? but that which is definite,
having make, and corporeal substance, and tracts
that comprehend it, as a mountain and a valley
and a market and a house and a mosque, the
noun signifying such a thing cannot become an
adverb; for you may not say, قَعَدْتُ الدَّارَ, nor
صَلَّيْتُ المَسْجِدَ, nor نِمْتُ الجَبَلَ, nor قُمْتُ الوَادِىَ;
the phrases of this kind that occur being instances
of the suppression of a prep.; as دَخَلْتُ البَيْتَ,
and نَزَلْتُ الوَادِىَ, and صَعِدْتُ الجَبَلَ. (S, O, TA.)
You say also, دَخَلْتُ عَلَى زَيْدٍ الدَّارَ, meaning I
entered the house after Zeyd, he being in it.
(Msb.) [And simply دَخَلَ عَلَيْهِ He came in
upon him: and also he came upon him; i. e. invaded him.] And دَخَلَ بِامْرَأَتِهِ, (Msb, TA,) and
عَلَيْهَا, (MA,) inf. n. دُخُولٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) [like
دَخَلَ بِأَهْلِهِ, and عَلَيْهَا, (see أَهْلٌ,) i. e. (tropical:)  He went
in to his wife or woman,] is a metonymical
phrase, denoting الجِمَاع, (Msb, TA,) i. e. الوَطْء,
(Mgh, Msb, TA,) whether it be such as is allowed
by the law or such as is forbidden, (Mgh,) generally such as is lawful. (Msb, TA. [See what
is said in explanation of the term خَلْوَةٌ in the first
paragraph of art. خلو.]) And دَخَلَ بَعْضُهُ فِى
بَعْضٍ i. q. تَدَاخَلَ [q. v.]. (TA in art. قصر, &c.)
[For ex.,] you say, دَخَلَ بَعْضُ النُّجُومِ فِى بَعْضٍ
[The stars became confused together]. (Mgh and
TA in art. شبك: in the former coupled with
اِخْتَلَطَتْ.) And دَخَلَ فِيهِمْ [He entered among
them, so as to become a member of their community, confraternity, party, sect, or the like;] said
of a stranger. (K.) [And دَخَلَ فِى طَاعَتِهِ: see
طَائِعٌ, in art. طوع.] When دَخَلَ is said of income, or revenue, [meaning It came in, accrued,
or was received,] the aor. is as above, and the
inf. n. دَخْلٌ: (Msb:) and you say, يَدْخُلُ عَلَى
الإِنْسَانِ [It comes in, or accrues, to the man].
(Msb, K. *) دَخَلَ بِهِ [lit. He entered with him,
or it]: see 4. ―
-b2-  [Hence, دَخَلَ فِيهِ meaning (assumed tropical:)  It
became included, comprehended, or comprised, in
it. And hence,] دَخَلَ فِى دِينِ الإِسْلَامِ (assumed tropical:)  [He
entered within the pale of the religion of ElIslám; he entered the communion of that religion; he entered into, embraced, or became a
proselyte to, that religion]. (Msb in art. سلم, &c.
[See Kur cx. 2.]) And دَخَلَ فِى الأَمْرِ, inf. n.
دُخُولٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He entered upon, began, or commenced,
the affair. (Msb.) [And دَخَلَ فِى أَمْرِ غَيْرِهِ, and
أُمُورِ غَيْرِهِ, and ↓ تدخّل, and ↓ تداخل (assumed tropical:)  He entered
into, or mixed himself in, another's affair, and another's affairs.] ―
-b3-  [Hence also, دَخَلَ عَلَيْهِ said
of night, &c., It came upon him, or invaded him.
And said of a word, such as a prep. &c., It was,
or became, prefixed to it, preposed to it, or put
before it.] ―
-b4-  [دَخَلَنِى مِنْهُ seems (from an instance
in art. بضع in the K) to mean (assumed tropical:)  An evil opinion
of him entered my mind; from دَخْلٌ as signifying
“ a thing that induces doubt, or suspicion, or evil
opinion. ”]
-A2-  دُخِلَ, (S, K,) like عُنِىَ; (K;)
and دَخِلَ, aor.
دَخَلَ; inf. n. [of the former] دَخْلٌ
and [of the latter] دَخَلٌ; (K;) (assumed tropical:)  He had an unsoundness (دَخَلٌ, S, K, i. e. فَسَادٌ, K) in his intel-lect, (S, K,) or in his body, (K,) or in his grounds
of pretension to respect. (TA in explanation of
the former verb.) And دَخِلَ أَمْرُهُ, aor.
دَخَلَ, (K,)
inf. n. دَخَلٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  His affair, or case, or state,
was, or became, intrinsically bad or corrupt or
unsound. (K.) ―

-b3-
دُخِلَ عَلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  He was led into a mistake, or an
error, respecting a thing, without knowing it, by
his having preconceived it. (Msb.)
2
دخّل, inf. n. تَدْخِيلٌ, He put dates into a
دَوْخَلَّة [q. v.]. (TA.) [In the present day, دخّلهُ
is used in the first of the senses assigned below to
أَدْخَلَهُ; but for this I have not found any classical
authority.]
3
مُدَاخَلَةٌ [inf. n. of داخل] signifies The
entering [with another] into a place: or (assumed tropical:)  into
an affair. (KL.) You say, داخلهُ فِى أُمُورِهِ
(assumed tropical:)  [He entered with him into, or mixed with him
in, his affairs]. (JK, S.) And دَاخَلَهُمْ [alone
(assumed tropical:)  He entered with them into, or mixed with them
in, their affairs: he mixed with them in familiar,
or social, intercourse: he conversed with them;
or was, or became, intimate with them]. (Lh,
TA in the present art. and in art. خلط. [See 3
in art. خلط.]) And دَاخَلَهُ فَسَادٌ فِى عَقْلٍ أَوْ جِسْمٍ
(assumed tropical:)  [Unsoundness in intellect, or body, infected him,
as though commingling with him; like خَالَطَهُ].
(K.) دِخَالٌ [also is an inf. n. of داخل]: see 6,
in two places. ―
-b2-  [See also دِخَالٌ below.]
4
ادخلهُ, inf. n. إِدْخَالٌ and مُدْخَلٌ, (S, K,)
He made, or caused, him, or it, to enter; or to
go, come, pass, or get, in; he put in, inserted,
brought in, or introduced, him, or it; as also
بِهِ ↓ دَخَلَ [lit. he entered with him, or it], (K,
TA,) inf. n. دُخُولٌ. (TA.) You say, أَدْخَلْتُ
زَيْدًا الدَّارَ, [for فِىالدَّارِ, I made, or caused,
Zeyd to enter the house, or I brought, or introduced, Zeyd into the house,] inf. n. مُدْخَلٌ.
(Msb.) Hence, in the Kur [xvii. 82], رَبِّ أَدْخَلْنِى
مُدْخَلَ صِدْقٍ (S, * TA) O my Lord, cause me to
enter El-Medeeneh in a good, or an agreeable,
manner: (Jel: [see also various similar explanations in Bd:]) [or ↓ مُدْخَل may be here a n.
of place, or of time: see, in art. خرج, what is
said of the words of the Kur that follow, أَخْرِجْنِى
مَخْرَجَ صِدْقٍ.] One says also, أَدْخَلْتُ الخُفَّ فِى
رِجْلِى and القَلَنْسُوَةَ فِى رَأْسِى [for أَدْخَلْتُ رِجْلِى فِى
الخُفِّ and رَأْسِى فِى القَلَنْسُوَةِ I put, or inserted,
my leg, or foot, into the boot and my head into
the cap]. (Ham p. 43.) ―
-b2-  Hence the saying,
يُدْخِلُ عَلَى قَوْمِهِ مَكْرُوهًا يَلْطَخُهُمْ بِهِ [He brings
against his people an abominable, or evil, charge,
aspersing them with it]. (S in art. عر.)
5
تَدَخَّلَ see 1, first sentence: and again in the latter
half of the paragraph.
6
تداخل signifies دَخَلَ بَعْضُهُ فِى بَعْضٍ [One
part of it entered into another, or parts of it
into others; meaning it became intermixed, intermingled, commixed, or commingled; it intermixed; it became confused: and hence it often
means it became compact, or contracted]. (TA
in art. قصر.) [Hence,] تَدَاخَلٌ signifies The
entering of joints one into another; (M;) as
also ↓ دِخَالٌ (JK, M, K) and ↓ دَخِيلٌ; (K;) but
this last is not in the M [nor in the JK], and
requires consideration: (TA:) [perhaps the joints
(مَفَاصِل) here mentioned are those of a coat of
mail; for it is said immediately before in the
JK that دِخَالٌ in coats of mail signifies firmness,
or compactness, of make. Hence also,] تَدَاخُلُ
اللُّغَاتِ [The intermixture, or commixture, of
dialects]. (Mz 17th نوع.) And تَدَاخُلُ الأُمُورِ
(assumed tropical:)  The dubiousness and confusedness of affairs;
as also الأُمُورِ ↓ دِخَالُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also 1, in the
latter half of the paragraph.
-A2-  [It is also trans.]
You say, تَدَاخَلَنِ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ [Something thereof,
or therefrom, crept into me, i. e., into my mind].
(S, TA. [In the former, this meaning seems to be
indicated by what there immediately precedes.])
And تَدَاخَلَنِى مِنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ رَمَضٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Distress
and disquietude, or grief, crept into me from, or
in consequence of, this thing]. (A and TA in
art. رمض.)
7
إِنْدَخَلَ see 1, first sentence.
8
إِدَّخَلَ: see 1, first sentence. ادّخل عَلَىَّ
[app. He encroached upon me]. (TA in art.
هيض: see 1 in that art.)
10
استدخل He wished, desired, asked, or
begged, to enter. (KL.) ―
-b2-  And He entered a
خَمَر [or covert of trees &c., or some other place
of concealment]: said of one lurking to shoot, or
cast, at objects of the chase. (TA.)
دَخْلٌ Income, or revenue, or profit, that comes
in, or accrues, to a man from his immovable
property, such as land and houses and palm-trees
&c., (T, Msb, K,) and from his merchandise;
(Msb;) contr. of خَرْجٌ; (S;) as also ↓ مَدْخُولٌ
[for مَدْخُولٌ بِهِ]: (TA:) the former is originally
an inf. n., of which the verb is دَخَلَ, aor.
دَخُلَ.
(Msb.) You say, دَخْلُهُ أَكْثَرُ مِنْ خَرْجِهِ [His
income is more than his outgoings, or expenditure]. (Msb.)
-A2-  See also دُخْلَةٌ. ―
-b2-  A disease;
(K;) as also ↓ دَخَلٌ: (K, TA; but not decisively
shown to have this meaning in the CK:) a vice,
fault, defect, or blemish; (S, K;) and particularly in one's grounds of pretension to respect,
(Az, TA,) as also, thus restricted, ↓ دَخَلٌ: (K,
TA:) and a thing that induces doubt, or suspicion, or evil opinion; as also ↓ دَخَلٌ [app.
in all the senses explained in this sentence: each
originally an inf. n.: see دُخِلَ and دَخِلَ]. (S,
K.) Hence the saying, (S, TA,) of
دَخُلَ Athmeh
Bint-Matrood, (TA,)
وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ بِالدَّخْلِ  تَرَى الفِتْيَانَ كَالنَّخْلِ
[Thou seest the youths, or young men, like palmtrees; but what will acquaint thee with the vice,
&c., that is, or may be, in them]: (S, O, TA:)
applied in relation to him who is of pleasing
aspect, but devoid of good. (O, TA. [See also
another reading of this verse voce رَقْلَةٌ.])
-A3-  See
also دِخَالٌ:
-A4-  and دَخِلٌ.
دُخْلٌ [A species of millet;] i. q. جَاوَرْسٌ; as
also دُخْنٌ. (TA.)
دِخْلٌ: see دُخْلَةٌ.
دَخَلٌ primarily signifies A thing that enters
into another thing and is not of it. (Bd in
xvi. 94.) See دَخْلٌ, in three places. Also Badness, corruptness, or unsoundness; or a bad, a
corrupt, or an unsound, state or quality; (S in
art. دغل, and K;) in intellect or in body [&c.].
(K.) You say, فِى عَقْلِهِ دَخَلٌ [In his intellect is
an unsoundness]. (S, K.) And هٰذَاالأَمْرُ فِيهِ دَخَلٌ
and دَغَلٌ [This affair, or case, in it is an unsoundness]: both signify the same. (S.) ―
-b2-  Rottenness in a palm-tree. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Leanness, or emaciation. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Perfidiousness, faithlessness,
or treachery: (K and TA; but not in the CK:)
deceit, guile, or circumvention. (S, K.) Hence,
in the Kur [xvi. 96], وَلَا تَتَّخِذُوا أَيْمَانَكُمْ دَخَلًا
بَيْنَكُمْ [And make ye not your oaths to be a means
of] deceit, or guile, or circumvention, between
you. (S, TA. [And in the same sense it is used
in verse 94 of the same ch.])
-A2-  Also People, or
persons, who assert their relationship to those of
whom they are not: (K:) in this sense thought
by ISd to be a quasi-pl. n. [app. of دَخِيلٌ (q. v.),
like as شَرَفٌ is of شَرِيفٌ]. (TA.) You say,
هُمْ دَخَلٌ فِى بَنِى فُلَانٍ They are, among the sons
of such a one, persons who assert their relationship to them not being of them. (S, K.) [But
Freytag asserts, though without naming any
authority, evidently taking it from the TK, in
which I find it, that one says, هم دخل لهم, and
also هو; thus applying it to a single person
(which is questionable) as well as to a plurality.]
―
-b2-  And Tangled, or luxuriant, or abundant and
dense, trees; (K;) as also دَغَلٌ. (TA.)
دَخِلٌ Intrinsically bad or corrupt or unsound:
and ↓ دَخْلٌ occurs in the same sense at the end of
a verse: this may be a contraction of the former,
or it may be for ذُو دَخْلٍ. (TA.)
دَخْلَةٌ A place in which bees, (K,) or wild bees,
(AA, TA,) deposit their honey. (AA, K, TA.)
-A2-  See also the next paragraph.
دُخْلَةٌ The night of the ceremony of conducting
a bride to her husband. (TA.) [In the present
day, this night is commonly called لَيْلَةُالدُّخْلَةِ;
vulgarly لَيْلَة اَلدُّخْلَهْ.]
-A2-  (assumed tropical:)  The inward, or intrinsic, state, or circumstances, of a man; as
also ↓ دَاخِلَةٌ: (S:) or, as also ↓ دِخْلَةٌ and ↓ دَخْلَةٌ
and ↓ دَخِيلَةٌ and ↓ دَخِيلٌ and ↓ دُخْلُلٌ and ↓ دُخْلَلٌ
and ↓ دُخَيْلَآءُ and ↓ دَاخِلَةٌ and ↓ دُخَّلٌ and ↓ دِخَالٌ,
(K,) or, accord. to Lth, ↓ دُخَالٌ, (TA,) and
↓ دُخَّيْلَى and ↓ دِخْلٌ and ↓ دَخْلٌ (assumed tropical:)  a man's intention: his way of acting, or his opinion: his
whole case or circumstances: his mind, or heart:
and his secret. (K.) You say, هُوَ عَالِمٌ بِدُخْلَتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He
is acquainted with his inward, or intrinsic, state or
circumstances. (S.) And every one of the foregoing
fourteen syn. words is prefixed to the word أَمْر,
so that you say, عَرَفْتُ دُخْلَةَ أَمْرِهِ &c., meaning
(assumed tropical:)  I knew the whole [of the inward, or intrinsic,
circumstances] of his case. (TA.) ↓ فَرَشْتُهُ دِخْلَةَ
أَمْرِى, or فَرَشْتُ لَهُ دِخْلَةَ أَمْرِى, is a post-classical
prov., meaning (assumed tropical:)  I laid open to him the inward,
or intrinsic, and true, or real, state of my case.
(Har p. 306.) One says also, ↓ هُوَ حَسَنُّ الدِّخْلَةِ
and ↓ المَدْخَلِ (tropical:)  He is good in his way of acting
in his affairs: (K, TA:) and ↓ فُلَانٌ حَسَنُ المَدْخَلِ
وَالمَخْرَجِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is good, and laudable, in
his way of acting, or conduct. (TA.)
دِخْلَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
three places: ―
-b2-  and see دُخْلُلٌ. ―
-b3-  Also A
mixture of colours in a colour. (T, M, K.)

and the paragraph here next following.
دُخْلُلٌ (assumed tropical:)  A companion, [such as is] a confidant,
and special friend; as also ↓ دَخِيلٌ (KL) and

voce وَلِيجَةٌ) and ↓ دِخْلَةٌ [app. for صَاحِبُ دِخْلَة]:
(L voce وَلِيجَةٌ:) [the pl.] دُخْلُلُونَ signifies
special, or particular, and choice, or select,
friends: (Az, TA:) or دُخْلُلٌ signifies, as also
↓ دِخْلَلٌ and ↓ دَخِيلٌ and ↓ مُدَاخِلٌ, one who enters
with another into the affairs of the latter: (K,
TA:) [i. e.] الرَّجُلِ ↓ دَخِيلُ and دُخْلُلُهُ signify the
man's particular, or special, intimate, who enters
with him into his affairs. (S.) You say, بَيْنَهُمَا
دُخْلُلٌ and ↓ دِخْلَلٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Between them two
is a particular, or special, intimate, who enters
with them into their affairs: so says Lh: but
ISd says, I know not what it is: accord. to the T,
on the authority of AO, the meaning is, between
them is brotherhood, or fraternization, and love,
or affection: and accord. to ISd and the K,
الحُبِّ ↓ دُخْلَلٌ and دُخْلُلُهُ [the latter not in the
CK nor in my MS. copy of the K] and ↓ دَاخِلُهُ signify (assumed tropical:)  purity of inward love. (TA.) ―
-b2-  دُخْلُلُونَ
signifies also Persons of the lower, or lowest, sort,
who enter among a people, or party, of whom
they are not: thus having two contr. meanings.
(Az, TA.) ―
-b3-  الدخلل [app. الدُّخْلُلُ] and ↓ الدُّخَّالُ
[thus in the TA] and ↓ الدَّاخِلُ, accord. to IAar,
all signify The same as الأُذُنِ ↓ دَخَّالِ [an appellation now applied to the ear-wig; in the K, art.
عقرب, said to be the عُقْرُبَان, but not as meaning
the عَقْرَب or the male عَقْرَب]: accord. to AZ, it
is the هرنصان [i. e. هِرْنِصَان or هِرِنْصَان, a kind of
worm, the species of which is doubtful]. (TA.)
―
-b4-  See also دِخَّلٌ.

دِخَالٌ [an inf. n. of 3, q. v.]. ―
-b2-  In watering,
(S, K,) it is The putting in a camel, that has
drunk, between two camels that have not drunk,
(K,) or the bringing back a camel, that has
drunk, from the resting-place by the water, to the
watering-trough, and putting him in between two
thirsty camels, (S,) in order that he may drink
what, may-be, he has not drunk: (S, K:) in like
manner it is explained in the T, on the authority
of As, who adds that this is done only when the
water is scanty: (TA:) or the putting in a weak
or sick camel [that has already drunk] with those
that are drinking, and then, after that, with those
that are returning to the water, so that he drinks
three times: (Skr:) or the driving of camels to
the watering-trough a second time, in order that
they may complete their drinking, after they
have already been watered drove by drove: (JK,

is that of As: (TA:) or the driving of camels to

of digression, or as having some relation to the
class, or category, of the proper subjects treated
of, but not included therein. (Msb.) ―
