or دَبرَى may be a simple subst.,] The people, or
company of men, perished; (As, * S, * M, K *
TA;) went away, turning the back, and did not
return. (TA. [And ادبر (q. v.) has a similar, or
the same, meaning.]) Hence, عَلَيْهِ الدَّبَارُ Perdition
befall him; may he go away, turning the back,
and not return. (M, TA.) ―
-b6-  And دَبَرَ (tropical:)  He became an old man. (S, A, K.) Hence, as some
say, the expression in the Kur [lxxiv. 36], وَاللَّيْلُ
إِذَا دَبَرَ (tropical:)  [And the night when it groweth old]. (TA.
[See also 4.]) ―

or sores, on his back, (M, Mgh, K, * TA,) produced by the saddle and the like; (Mgh;) as also
↓ ادبر. (K. [But the corresponding passage in the
M shows that this is probably a mistake for أَدْبَرُ
a syn. of دَبِرٌ.])

تَدْبِيرٌ, (T, S, K,) He considered, or forecast, the

Msb, K:) or he looked to what would, or might,
be its result: and فِيهِ ↓ تدبّر he thought, or meditated, upon it; (S;) [as also ↓ تدبّرهُ:] Aktham
Ibn-Seyfee said to his sons, أَعْجَازَ ↓ يَابَنِىَّ لَا تَتَدَبَّرُوا
أُمُورٍ قَدْ وَلَّتْ صُدُورُهَا [O my sons, think not upon
the ends of things whereof the beginnings have
passed]: (T: [see عَجُزٌ:]) and in the Kur [iv.
84] it is said, القُرْآنَ ↓ أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ Will they,
then, not consider the meanings of the Kur-án,
and endeavour to obtain a clear knowledge of
what is in it? (Bd:) and again, in the Kur
[xxiii. 70], القَوْلَ ↓ أَفَلَمْ يَدَّبَّرُوا Have they, then,
not thought upon, (TA,) and endeavoured to understand, (يَتَفَهَّمُوا, K,) what has been said to them
in the Kur-án? for ↓ تَدَبُّرٌ signifies the thinking,
or meditating, upon [a thing], and endeavouring
to understand [it]; syn. تَفَكُّرٌ and تَفَهُّمٌ: (TA:)
and ↓ تدبّرهُ he looked into it, considered it, examined it, or studied it, repeatedly, in order to
know it, or until he knew it. (Msb in art. امل.)
دبّر أَمْرًا, inf. n. as above, signifies [also] He did,
performed, or executed, a thing, or an affair,
with thought, or consideration. (Msb.) [And
He devised, planned, or plotted, a thing, عَلَى غَيْرِهِ
against another. And hence, He managed, conducted, ordered, or regulated, an affair; because
the doing so requires consideration of the issues,
or results, of the affair. You say, دبّر أُمُورَ البِلَادِ,
and, elliptically, دبّر البِلَادَ, He managed, conducted, ordered, or regulated, the affairs of the
provinces, or country: and in like manner, the
affairs of a house. تَدْبِيرٌ is also attributed to irrational animals; as, for ex., to horses; meaning
their conducting the affair of victory: and to inanimate things; as, for ex., to stars; meaning
their regulating the alternations of seasons &c.: see
Bd in lxxix. 5. And دبّر alone signifies He acted
with consideration of the issues, or results, of
affairs, or events, or cases; acted with, or exercised, forecast, or forethought; or acted with
policy.] ―

دَبُخَ; (TA;) He related
the tradition, &c., having received it, or heard it,
from him, (S, M, K,) after his death: (S, K:)
Sh says that دبّر الحَدِيثَ is unknown; but so the
phrase is related on the authority of A'Obeyd:
Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà [i. e. Th] disallows يُدَبِّرُهُ as
meaning he relates it; and says that it is يَذْبُرُهُ,
with ذ, meaning “he knows it, or learns it, well,
soundly, or thoroughly;” syn. يُتْقِنُهُ. (T.)
3
دابرهُ, (S, A, *) inf. n. مُدَابَرَةٌ and دِبَارٌ, (K,)

ادبر, (M, K, and Bd in ix. 25,) inf. n. إِدْبَارٌ
(S, M) and ↓ دُبْرٌ, accord. to Kr, but correctly the
latter is a simple subst. [or quasi-inf. n.]; (M;)
and ↓ دَبَرَ, (IAar, S, K,) inf. n. دَبْرٌ (TA) and دُبُورٌ;
(TK;) He went, turning his back; turned back;
went back; took a backward course; retreated;
retired; retrograded; declined; syn. وَلَّىِ (S, M,
K) and تَأَخَّرَ (IAar) and ذَهَبَ إِلَى خَلْفٍ; (Bd
ubi suprà, and S and K in art. قبل;) contr. of
أَقْبَلَ. (S, Bd.) And ادبر بِهِ [He went back, or
backward, with it, or him; removed, or turned,
it, or him, backward]. (S, K.) You say, يُدْبِرُ
بِالدَّلْوِ إِلَى الحَوْضِ [He goes back with the bucket
to the watering-trough]: opposed to the phrase
يُقْبِلُ بِهَا إِلَى بِئْرِ. (A.) See also دَبِيرٌ, first sentence. And ادبر عَنْهُ [He went back, &c., from
it, or him]. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  He feigned
himself negligent of, or inattentive to, the want of
his friend; (K;) as though he turned back from

went backward, to a bad state; said of the affair,
or case, of a people. (M, TA.) You say also,
أَمْرٌ فُلَانٍ إِلَى إِقْبَالٍ and [in the contr. sense] الى
إِدْبَارٌ (assumed tropical:)  [The affair, or case, of such a one is inclining to advance, and to go backward, to a bad
state]. (A.) [إِدْبَارٌ often signifies The retiring,
or declining, of good fortune; opposed to إِقْبَالٌ:
see also 1, in the latter part of the paragraph.]
And ادبر القَوْمُ (assumed tropical:)  The case of the people took a
backward course, and there remained none of them.
(TA.) And ادبر النَّهَارِ and ↓ دَبَرَ (inf. n. of the latter
دُبُورٌ, A) signify the same; (Fr, T, S, M;) i. e. The
day went, or departed; (M, A;) and so الصَّيْفُ
[the summer, or the spring]: and in like manner
one says [in the contr. sense] أَقْبَلَ and قَبَلَ: so
says Fr, and he adds, but you say of a man,
اقبل الرَّاكِبُ and ادبر only, with ا, though [Az
says] it seems to me that the two forms are applicable in the same manner to men as they are to
times. (T.) Some read, in the Kur [lxxiv. 36],
↓ وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا دَبَرَ, (T, S,) which, accord. to some,
means And the night when it cometh after the
day; (T;) or when it followeth the day: (S:
[for another rendering, see 1:]) others, (T, S,)
the greater number, (T,) read اذا أَدْبَرَ, (T, S,)
meaning when it retreateth to depart. (T.)
[Hence,] ادبرت الصَّلَاةُ (assumed tropical:)  The prayer ended. (Bd
in l. 39.) And وَإِدْبَارَ السُّجُودِ: and وَإِدْبَارَ النُّجُومِ:

↓ مِنْهُ وَمَا دَبَرَ signify the same [i. e. What is in
front, of the mountain; and what is behind].
(JK.)
-A2-  ادبر also signifies He made a man to
be behind him. (M.)
-A3-  And It, (the saddle,
S, K, or a burden, M, TA,) and he, (a man, S,
Mgh,) caused a camel, (S, M, Mgh,) or a horse
or the like, (K,) to have galls, or sores, on the
back; galled the back. (M, Mgh, K. *) ―

-b3-
See also 1, last signification.
-A4-  It is also said [app.,
of a man, as meaning He slit the ear of a she-camel
in a particular manner, i. e.,] when (T) the فَتْلَة
[or twisted slip formed by slitting (see إِدْبَارَةٌ)] of
the ear of a she-camel, (T, K,) it being slit, (T,
[but for اذا نحرت in the TT and TA, from which
this is taken, I read إِذَا بُحِرَتْ, an emendation evidently required,]) turns towards the back of the
neck: (IAar, T, TT, K, * TA:) and أَقْبَلَ is said
in like manner when this فتلة is turned towards
the face. (IAar, T, TT, TA. [See also 3.])
-A5-  It
signifies also عَرَفَ دَبِيرَهُ مِنْ قَبِيلِهِ, (IAar,) or عَرَفَ
قَبِيلَهُ مِنْ دَبِيرِهِ; (K;) said of a man. (IAar.
[See دَبِيرٌ.])
-A6-  Also He, (K,) a man, (TA,) or it,
a company of men, (S, M,) entered upon [a time
in which blew] the wind called الدَّبُور. (S, M,
K.)
-A7-  And He journeyed on the day called دُبَار,
i. e. Wednesday. (K, TA.)
-A8-  And He became
possessed of much property or wealth, or of many
camels or the like. (Msb, * K.)
5
تَدَبَّخَ see 2, in nine places. ―
-b2-  عَرَفَ الأَمْرَ تَدَبُّرًا
means He knew the thing at the last, (M, Mgh,)
after it had past. (Mgh.) Jereer says, (M,)

وَلَا تَعْرِفُونَ الأَمْرَ إِلَّا تَدَبُّرَا
[And ye fear not evil until it befalleth you, and
ye know not the thing save at the last, when it
has past]. (M, Mgh. *) [See also 10.] And in
like manner, تَدَبَّرَ الكَلَامَ [meaning He postponed
the saying] is said of one who has sworn after

استدبرهُ contr. of استقبلهُ. (S, * Msb, K. *)
[As such it signifies He turned his back towards
him, or it.] You say, استدبر القِبْلَةَ He turned

know, (TA,) at the beginning of it: (M, K:)
[or rather] he knew it at the end of an affair, or a
case; namely, a thing that he did not know at
the beginning of it. (T, A.) You say, اِسْتَدْبَرَ
مِنْ أَمْرِهِ مَالَمْ يَسْتَقْبِلْ He knew at the end of his
affair, or case, what he did not know at the
beginning of it. (A.) And إِنَّ فُلَانًا لَوِ اسْتَقْبَلَ مِنْ

one, had he known at the beginning of his affair,

been directed to the right way of executing his
affair. (T.) [See also 5.] ―
-b4-  استدبرهُ عَلَى غَيْرِهِ
He appropriated it to himself exclusively, in preference to others: (AO, K:) because he who
does so turns his back upon others, and retires
from them. (TA.) El-Aashà says, describing
wine,
عَلَى الشَّرْبِ أَوْ مُنْكِرٍ مَا عُلِمْ   تَمَزَّرْتُهَاغَيْرَ مُسْتَدْبِرٍ
i. e. [I sipped it] not appropriating [it] to myself

rather coll. gen. ns.] whereof the sings. [or ns.
un.] are ↓ دَبْرَةٌ and ↓ دِبَارَةٌ; which signify A
مَشَارَة [explained in the TA as meaning a channel
of water; but it seems to be here used as meaning a portion of ground separated from the
adjacent parts, for sowing or planting, being surrounded by dams, or by ridges of earth, which
retain the water for irrigation, as explained in
art. شور, and as is indicated by its Persian equivalent here following,] in, (S,) or of, (K,) land
that is sown or for sowing; (S, K;) called in
Persian كُرْد: (S:) and دِبَارٌ signifies small
channels for irrigation between tracts of seedproduce; (K;) and its sing. is دَبْرَةٌ: (TA:)
[Mtr says,] دَبْرَةٌ is syn. with مَشَارَةٌ; in Persian
كَرْدَه [app. a mistranscription for كُرْد as above];
and the pl. is دَبْرٌ and دِبَارٌ: (Mgh:) [ISd says,]
دَبْرَةٌ signifies a small channel for irrigation
between tracts of land sown or for sowing: or,
as some say, i. q. مَشَارَةٌ: and the pl. is دِبَارٌ: it is
also said that دِبَارٌ signifies i. q. كُرْدَةٌ; and its
n. un. is دِبَارَةٌ: and دِبَارَاتٌ signifies rivulets that
flow through land of seed-produce; and its sing.
is دَبْرَةٌ: but I know not how this is, unless دَبْرَةٌ
have دِبَارٌ for its pl., and this have ة added to it,
as in فِحَالَةٌ, and so دبارات be a pl. pl., i. e. perfect
pl. of دِبَارَةٌ: AHn says that دَبْرَةٌ signifies a patch
of ground that is sown; [as is also said in the
K;] and the pl. is دِبَارٌ. (M.) ―
-b2-  Also A piece
of rugged ground in a بَحْرٌ [i. e. sea or large
river], like an island, which the water overflows
[at times] and from which [at times] it recedes.
(M, K.) ―
-b3-  And A mountain; (T, K;) in the
Abyssinian language: (TA: [Az says, “I
know not whether it be Arabic or not:”]) whence
the saying of the King of Abyssinia, (T, * K, *
TA,) مَا أُحِبُّ أَنَّ لِى دَبْرًا ذَهَبًا وَأَنِّىآذَيْتُ رَجُلًا
مِنَ المُسْلِمِينَ [I would not that I had a mountain of gold and that I had harmed a man of
the Muslims]: (T, K:) but [SM says that] this
is a confounding of two readings; which are,
دَبْرًا مِنْ ذَهَبٍ and أَنْ يَكُونَ دَبْرٌ لِى ذَهَبًا: (TA:)
another reading is ذَبْرًا مِنْ ذَهَبٍ. (TA in art.
ذبر.) ―
-b4-  See also دِبْرٌ. ―
-b5-  Also, (S, M, K, &c.,)
and ↓ دِبْرٌ, (AHn, M, K,) A swarm of bees: and
hornets, or large wasps; syn. زَنَابِيرُ: (S, M, K:)
and the like thereof, having stings in their hinder
parts: (B:) it has no sing., or n. un.: (As, M:)
or the n. un. is ↓ دَبْرَةٌ or ↓ دِبْرَةٌ; of which the
dim. ↓ دُبَيْرَةٌ occurs in a trad.: (TA:) pl. [of
pauc.] أَدْبُرٌ (K) and [of mult.] دُبُورٌ: (As, S, K:)
and ↓ دَبُورٌ, with fet-h to the first letter, signifies
bees; and has no proper sing. (M.) 'Ásim Ibn-Thábit El-Ansáree was called حَمِىُّ الدَّبْرِ [The
protected of hornets, or bees], because his corpse
was protected from his enemies by large hornets,
(S,) or by a swarm of bees. (M, Mgh * in art.
حمى.) ―
-b6-  دَبْرٌ also signifies The young ones of
locusts; (AHn, K;) and so ↓ دِبْرٌ. (AHn, M, K.)
دُبْرٌ: see دُبُرٌ: and دَبَرِىٌّ; the latter in two
places.
-A2-  See also 4, first sentence.
دِبْرٌ: see دَبْرٌ, last sentence but two, and last
sentence. ―
-b2-  Also, (S, M, K,) and ↓ دَبْرٌ, (M, K,)
Much property or wealth; or many camels or
the like; (S, M, K;) such as cannot be computed, or calculated: (M:) the sing. [and dual]
and pl. are alike: you say [using it as an epithet]
مَالٌ دِبْرٌ and مَالَانِ دِبْرٌ and أَمْوَالٌ دِبْرٌ: (S, M:)
this mode of usage is best known; but sometimes دُبُورٌ is used as its pl.: (M:) in like manner you say مَالٌ دَثْرٌ: and you say also رَجُلٌ ذُو
دِبْرٍ, (S, TA,) and رجل دبر, [unless this be a mistake for the phrase immediately preceding,] (Fr,
TA,) meaning a man having large possessions in
land or houses or other property. (Fr, S, TA.)
دَبَرٌ [app. signifies A tract of the western sky
at sunset: for] the Arabs said, إِذَا رَأَيْتَ الثُّرَيَّا
بِدَبَرْ فَشَهْرٌ نِتَاجْ وَشَهْرٌ مَطَرْ وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَ الشِّعْرَى بِقَبَلْ
فَمَجْدُ فَتًى وَحِمْلُ جَمَلْ, meaning When thou
seest the Pleiades near to setting with sunset,
then [is a month which] is a time of breeding of
camels, and [a month which is] a time of rain:
and when thou seest Sirius [near to rising] with
sunset, [then is the glory of the generous man,
and the time for the burden of the full-grown hecamel; for] then is the most intense degree of
cold, when none but the generous and noble and
ingenuous man will patiently persevere in the
exercise of hospitality and beneficence, and when
the heavy burden is not laid save upon the strong
full-grown he-camel, because then the camels
become lean and the pasturage is scanty. (M.)
-A2-  Also, and so is أَدْبَارٌ, a pl. [or rather the former is a coll. gen. n.] of ↓ دَبَرَةٌ, (S, M, K,) which
signifies A gall, or sore, on the back (M, * Mgh,
K, * TA) of a horse or the like (M, K, TA) and
of a camel, (M, Mgh,) produced by the saddle
and the like; (Mgh;) and also on the كِرْكِرَة
[or callous projection on the breast] of a camel.
(S and K in art. سر.) They used to say, in the
Time of Ignorance, إِذَا بَرَأَ الدَّبَرُ وَعَفَا الأَثَرُ, explained as meaning [When] the galls on the back
of the beast or upon the foot of the camel [shall
heal, and the footstep, or mark, become obliterated]. (TA from a trad.)
-A3-  Also inf. n. of
دَبِرَ. (M, Mgh.)
دَبِرٌ (M, K) and ↓ أَدْبَرُ (M) A horse or the like,
(M, K,) and a camel, (M,) having galls, or sores,
(M, K,) on his back (TA) [produced by the saddle
and the like; having his back galled: see دَبَرٌ]:
fem. [of the former] دَبِرَةٌ and [of the latter]
↓ دَبْرَآءُ: and pl. [of either] دَبْرَى. (M, TA.)
[Hence the prov.,] هَانَ عَلَى الأَمْلَسِ مَا لَاقَى الدَّبِرُ
[What he that had galls on his back experienced
was a light matter to him that had a sound
back]: applied to one who has an ill concern
for his companion. (K.) ―
-b2-  In the phrase رَجُلٌ
خَسِرٌ وَدَبِرٌ [app. meaning A man erring and
perishing], Lh says that دَبِرٌ is an imitative sequent to خَسِرٌ: but [ISd says,] I think that خَسِرٌ
is a verbal epithet, and that دَبِرٌ is a possessive
epithet. (M in art. دمر.) You say also أَحْمَقٌ
دَامِرٌ ↓ خَاسِرٌ دَابِرٌ: (T in art. بت: [see art. خسر:])
and دَابِرٌ is said to be an imitative sequent to
خَاسِرٌ. (TA.)
دُبُرٌ and ↓ دُبْرٌ, (the latter a contraction of the
former, Msb, [and not so commonly used, like as
إِبْلٌ is not so commonly used as إِبِلٌ,]) The back;
syn. ظَهْرٌ: (S, A, B, K;) the first signification
given in the [S and] A and B: pl. أَدْبَارٌ. (TA.)
You say, وَلَّى دُبُرَهُ [lit., He turned his back;
and tropically,] (tropical:)  he was put to flight. (A.)
And وَلَّاهُ دُبُرَهُ [lit., He turned his back to him;
and tropically,] the same as the phrase immediately preceding. (Mgh, Msb.) It is said in
the Kur [liv. 45], وَيُوَلُّونَ الدُّبُرَ [And they shall
turn the back, in flight]: where الدبر is used in a
collective sense, agreeably with another passage
in the Kur [xiv. 44], لَا يَرْتَدُّ إِلَيْهِمْ طَرْفُهُمْ. (S, B.)
You also say, ↓ وَلَّوْا دَبْرَةً (tropical:)  They turned back in
flight, or being routed. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  The back,
or hinder part, contr. of قُبُلٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) of

(Kur xii. 25, 27, and 28.) You say, وَقَعَ السَّهْمُ
بِدُبْرِ الهَدَفِ The arrow fell behind the butt. (TA
in art. قبل.) ―
-b3-  The backside; posteriors; buttocks; rump; or podex: and the anus: syn.
اِسْتٌ. (K.) [It has the former of these two significations in many instances; and the latter of them
in many other instances: in the S and K in art.
جعر, it is given as a syn. of مَجْعَرٌ, which has the
latter signification in the present day. This latter
signification may also be intended in the S, M,
A, Msb, and K, by the explanation “ contr. of
قُبُلٌ,” as well as the “ back, or hinder part,” of
anything: for قُبُلٌ very often signifies the “ anterior pudendum ” of a man or woman, and is so
explained. The anus is also called حَلْقَةُ الدُّبُرِ
and حِتَارُ الدُّبُرِ and شَرَجُ الدُّبُرِ.] Its pl. أَدْبَارٌ is also
applied to the part which comprises the اِسْت [or
anus] and the حَيَآء [or vulva, i. e., external
portion of the female organs of generation,] of a
solid-hoofed animal, and of a cloven-hoofed
animal, and of that which has claws, or talons:
or, as some say, of a camel, or an animal having
feet like those of the camel: and the sing., to the
حَيَآء [or vulva] alone, of any such animal. (M,
TT.) ―
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  The latter, or last, part, (T, S, M,
Msb, K,) of a thing, an affair, or an event, (T,
S, Msb,) or of anything: (M, K:) pl. أَدْبَارٌ
(M) [and دِبَارٌ: see دَبَرِىٌّ]. [See also دَابِرٌ.]
One says, جِئْتُكَ دُبُرِ الشَّهْرِ, and فِى دُبُرِهِ, and عَلَى
دُبُرِهِ, and أَدْبَارَ الشَّهْرِ, and فِى أَدْبَارِهِ, (tropical:)  I came to
thee in the latter, or last, part or parts, of the
month. (M, K.) And أَدْعُو لَكَ فِى أَدْبَارِ الصَّلَوَاتِ
(assumed tropical:)  [I will petition for thee in the latter, or last,
parts, or the conclusions, of the prayers]. (A.)
See also دَبَرِىٌّ. In the Kur [I. xxxix.], وَأَدْبَارَ
السُّجُودِ signifies (assumed tropical:)  And in the latter parts, or the
ends, of the prayers: and السُّجُودِ ↓ وَإِدْبَارَ [virtually] signifies the same [i. e. and in the ending
of prostration], and is another reading of the
text: Ks and Th adopt the former reading,
because every single prostration has its latter
part: or, accord. to the T, the meaning is, and in
the two rek'ahs (الرَّكْعَتَانِ) after sunset; as is
related on the authority of 'Alee the son of Aboo-Tálib. (TA.) The similar expression in the
Kur [lii. last verse] وَأَدْبَارَ النُّجُومِ is explained
by the lexicologists as signifying (assumed tropical:)  And during
the consecution of the stars, and their taking
towards the west, to set: but [ISd says,] I know
not how this is, since أَخْذٌ, by which they explain
it, is an inf. n., and أَدْبَار is a pl. of a subst.:
النُّجُومِ ↓ وَإِدْبَارَ, which is another reading of the
text, signifies and during the setting of the stars:
and Ks and Th adopt this latter reading: (M:)
or, accord. to the T, both mean and in the two
rek'ahs before daybreak. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Also The
hinder part, (M,) and angle, (زَاوِيَة,) of a house
or chamber or tent. (M, K.) ―

دُبُرٌ is said in the TA in art. قبل to be a pl.].
دَبْرَةٌ: see دُبُرٌ. ―
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A turn of evil fortune; an unfavourable turn of fortune: or a
turn to be vanquished; contr. of دَوْلَةٌ: (As, M,
K:) دَوْلَةٌ relates to good; and دَبْرَةٌ, to evil: one
says, جَعَلَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ الدَّبْرَةَ (assumed tropical:)  [May God make the
turn of evil fortune to be against him]: (As, T,
M:) this [says ISd] is the best explanation that
I have seen of دَبْرَةٌ: (M:) or (so accord. to the
M, but in the K “ and ”) it signifies (assumed tropical:)  the issue,
or result, of a thing or an affair or a case; (M,
K;) as in the saying of Aboo-Jahl to Ibn-Mes'ood, when he [the former] lay prostrate,
wounded, لِمَنِ الدَّبْرَةُ (assumed tropical:)  In whose favour is the
issue, or result? and was answered, “In favour
of God and his apostle, O enemy of God: ” (T,
TA:) also (tropical:)  defeat in fight; (S, A, Mgh, K;)
a subst. from الإِدْبَارُ, as also ↓ دَبَرَةٌ, (S,) and ↓ دَابِرَةٌ:
(IAar, A, K:) you say, كَانَتِ الدَّبْرَةُ لَهُ, meaning (tropical:)  His adversary was defeated; and عَلَيْهِ
meaning (tropical:)  He was himself defeated: (A:) and
لِمَنِ الدَّبْرَةُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Who is the defeater? and
عَلَىمَنِ الدَّبْرَةُ (assumed tropical:)  Who is the defeated? the pl.
of دَبْرَةٌ in the last sense is دِبَارٌ: (TA:) which
also signifies conflicts and defeats; (K;) as in
the saying, أَوْقَعَ اللّٰهُ بِهِمُ الدِّبَارَ God caused, or
may God cause, to befall them conflicts and
defeats. (TA.)
-A2-  See also دَبْرٌ, in two places.
دِبْرَةٌ The direction, or point, towards which one
turns his back; contr. of قِبْلَةٌ. (S, K.) One
says, مَا لَهُ قِبْلَةٌ وَلَا دِبْرَةٌ, meaning (tropical:)  He has no
way of applying himself rightly to his affair.
(S, K, TA.) And لَيْسَ لِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ قِبْلَةٌ وَلَا دِبْرَةٌ

دَبْرِىٌّ: see the next paragraph, in two places.
دَبَرِىٌّ [Backward: and hence, (tropical:)  late]. You
say, العِلْمُ قَبَلِىٌّوَلَيْسَ بِالدَّبَرِىِّ (assumed tropical:)  [True learning is
prompt, and is not backward]: i. e., the man of
sound learning answers thee quickly; but the backward says, I must consider it. (Th, T.) And
تَبِعْتُ صَاحِبِى دَبَرِيًّا (assumed tropical:)  I followed my companion,
fearing that he would escape me, after having
been with him, and having fallen back from him.
(M.) And شَرُّ الرَّأْىِ الدَّبَرِىُّ (T, S, A, K *) (tropical:)  The
worst opinion, or  counsel, is that which occurs [to
one] late, when the want [of it] is past; (T, S,
K, * TA;) i. e., when the affair is past: or رَأْىٌ
دَبَرِىٌّ signifies an opinion, or a counsel, not
deeply looked into; and in like manner, جَوَابٌ,
an answer, or a reply. (M.) And فُلَانٌ لَا يُصَلِّى
الصَّلَاةَ إِلَّا دَبَرِيًّا (AZ, S, M, A, K) and ↓ دَبْرِيًّا,
(AHeyth, K,) and the relaters of traditions say
↓ دُبُرِيًّا, (S,) which is said in the K to be a corruption, but it may have been heard from a good
authority, and with respect to the rules of the
language is chaste, for, accord. to IAth, دَبَرِىٌّ is
a rel. n. irregularly formed from دُبُرٌ, (TA,)
(tropical:)  Such a one performs not prayer save in the
last part of its time. (AZ, S, K *) It is said in
a trad., لَا يَأْتِى الصَّلَاةِ إِلَّا دَبَرِيًّا; and in another,
↓ الّا دُبْرًا or ↓ دَبْرًا, accord. to different relations;
(tropical:)  He will not come to prayer save at the last, or
late: and in another, ↓ أَتَى الصَّلَاةَ دِبَارًا (tropical:)  He came
to prayer at the latest of the times thereof;
(IAar, TA;) or after the time had gone: (S:)
↓ دِبَارٌ being a pl. of ↓ دُبُرٌ and ↓ دُبْرٌ meaning the
last of the times of prayer &c. (IAar, TA.)
One says also, ↓ جَآءَ فُلَانٌ دَبْرِيًّا (tropical:)  Such a one came
last, or latest. (A, * TA.) دبريًّا is in the accus.
case as an adv. n. of time [like دُبْرًا and دَبْرًا and
دِبَارًا], or as a denotative of state with respect to
the agent of the verb. (TA.) In the passage in the
K [where it is said that دَبَرِىٌّ signifies Prayer in
the last of its time, &c.], there is a looseness.
(TA.)
دُبُرِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.

them, a of Taurus:] five stars of Taurus, said

day of the week; (S, K;) an ancient name
thereof: (S, M, * TA:) or, accord. to the 'Eyn,
(K,) the night of [i. e. preceding the day of]
Wednesday: (M, K:) which latter explanation
is preferred by some authorities. (TA.) Wednesday is a day of ill luck: Mujáhid, being asked
respecting the day of ill luck, answered, “The
Wednesday that does not come round [again, i. e.
the last Wednesday,] in the month. ” (TA.)

also, فُلَانٌ مَا يَدْرِى قِبَالَ الأَمْرِ مِنْ دِبَارِهِ Such a
one does not know the first part of the affair
from the last thereof. (TA.) And مَا يَعْرِفُ قِبَالًا:
مِنْ دِبَارٍ: see دَبِيرٌ. And مَا أَنْتَ لَهُمْ فِى قِبَالٍ وَلَا
دِبَارٍ (assumed tropical:)  Thou art not one for whom they care.

blowing from the direction of the place of sunset:

direction of] the back, or hinder part, of the
Kaabeh, going towards the place of sunrise:

person when he is standing at the kibleh: [but
this is a most strange explanation:] or, accord.
to IAar, the wind that blows from the tract extending from the place where En-Nesr et-Táïr [or
Aquila] sets [i. e. about W. 10° N. in Central
Arabia] to the place where Suheyl [or Canopus]
rises [about S. 29° E. in Central Arabia]: (M:)
or that comes from the direction of the south
(الجَنُوب), going towards the place of sunrise:
(Msb:) it is the worst of winds: it is said that it
does not fecundate trees, nor raise clouds: (Meyd,
TA:) and in a trad. it is said that the tribe of
'Ád was destroyed by it: (T, TA:) it blows only
in the hot season, and is very thirsty: (TA voce
نَكْبَآءُ:) pl. دُبُرٌ and دَبَائِرُ. (M.) [Hence the saying,] عَصَفَتْ دَبُورُهُ وَسَقَطَتْ عَبُورُهُ [lit. His west
wind, or westerly wind, blew violently, and his
Sirius set: meaning (tropical:)  his evil fortune prevailed,
