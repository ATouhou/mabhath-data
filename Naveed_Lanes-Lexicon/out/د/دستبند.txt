دستبندالدَّسْتَبَنْدُ [from the Pers. دَسْبَنْدْ] A certain
game of the Magians, which they thus call; i. q.
الدَّعْكَسَةُ: (S and K in art. دعكس:) they turn
round [in a circle, as though imitating the revolutions of the “ host of heaven ”], having taken
one another by the hand, [in a manner] like
dancing. (K in that art.) [Hence probably originated the similar performances of certain Muslim darweeshes in celebrating what they term a
ذِكْر, described in the works of several travellers,
and in my own work on the Modern Egyptians.]
