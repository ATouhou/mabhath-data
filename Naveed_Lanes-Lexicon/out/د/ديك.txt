ديكدِكْ دِكْ a cry used in chiding domestic cocks.
(K.)
دِيكٌ a word of well-known meaning, (S, K,)
The domestic cock; i. e. the male of the دَجَاج:
(Msb, TA:) pl. (of mult. TA) دِيَكَةٌ and دُيُوكٌ
(S, Msb, K) and (of pauc. TA) أَدْيَاكٌ. (K.)
Sometimes it is employed as meaning دَجَاجَةٌ,
(K,) [which is a n. un., applied to the male and
to the female,] and is therefore made [grammatically] fem., (TA,) [though still applying to
the male, agreeably with a common license in the
case of a masc. noun that has a fem. syn., and
vice versa,] as in the saying,
دَجَاجَةٌوَزَّقَتِ الدَّيكُ بِصَوْتٍ زَقَّا
[And the cock muted with a sound, with vehement
muting]; (K;) because the ديك is also a دَجَاجَة:
so says ISd. (TA.) ―
-b2-  دِيكُ الجِنِّ [The cock of
the jinn, or genii;] a certain little creeping thing,
or insect, (دُوَيْبَّة,) found in gardens. (Kzw.)
And the surname of the poet 'Abd-Es-Selám.
(K.)
-A2-  Solicitously affectionate; compassionate:
(K:) or solicitously affectionate; affectionate to
off spring; applied to a man, in the dial. of ElYemen: so accord. to El-Muärrij; who says
that hence the ديك [or domestic cock] is thus
called. (TA.)
-A3-  (assumed tropical:)  The [season called] رَبِيع [here
meaning spring]; as though so called because of the various colours of its plants, or
herbage, (K, TA,) and thus likened to the ديك
[or domestic cock]. (TA.)
-A4-  One, and all, of
the three stones on which the cooking-pot is
placed: used alike as sign. and pl. (El-Muärrij,
K.)
-A5-  The protuberant bone behind the ear of
the horse: (K:) IKh explains it as meaning a
certain bone behind the ear; not particularizing a
horse nor any other animal. (IB.)
[
دِيكَةٌ is said by Golius, as on the authority of
the K, in which it is not found, to be sometimes
used as signifying A domestic hen.]
أَرْضٌ مَدَاكَةٌ and مُدَاكَةٌ and ↓ مَدِيكَةٌ A land
abounding with دِيَكَة [or domestic cocks]. (K.)
أَرْضٌ مَدِيكَةٌ: see what next precedes.
