دمّثهُ, (T, M, A, Msb,) inf. n. تَدْمِيثٌ,
(S, K,) He made it even, (T, A,) or soft, (S, K,)
or soft and even; (Msb;) namely, a place, (T,
A, Msb,) or a bed, or place on which to lie: (S:)
and (A) he macerated it, namely, a thing, and
mashed it, (M, A,) with his hand, (A,) in order
that it might become soft. (M, A.) [Hence,]
دَمِّثْ لِجَنْبِكَ قَبْلَ اللَّيْلِ مُضْطَجَعَا
(T,) or قَبْلَ النَّوْمِ, (A,) [lit. Make soft and even
for thy side a bed, or place on which to lie, before
night, or before sleeping;] a prov., meaning
(tropical:)  prepare for an event before its happening.
(T, * A.) [Hence also,] مَنْ كَذَبَ عَلَىَّ فَإِنَّمَا
يُدَمِّثُ مَجْلِسَهُ مِنَ النَّارِ, i. e. [Whoso lieth against
me, verily] he will make even, meaning will
prepare, his sitting-place in the fire [of Hell];
a saying of Mohammad. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  [And hence,]
دمّث الحَدِيثَ, (T, A,) inf. n. as above, (K,) (tropical:)  He
mentioned (T, A, K) the beginning of (T, A)
the tradition, or story. (T, A, K.) You say,
دَمِّثْ لِى ذٰلِكَ الحَدِيثَ حَتَّى أَطْعُنَ فِى خَوْضِهِ
(tropical:)  Mention thou to me the beginning of that
tradition, or story, in order that I may know
the manner thereof (T, A) and how I should
enter upon it [so that I may push on in it].
(A.)

مَا كَانَ أَدْمَثَ فُلَانًا وَأْلْيَنَهُ (tropical:)  How easy in
nature, or disposition, was such a one! [and how
gentle was he!]. (S, TA.)
دَمْثٌ: see دمِثٌ, in two places.
دَمَثٌ: see the next paragraph, in three places.
دَمِثٌ Even, or soft; applied to a valley, and
to anything: (T:) or a place soft and even;
(Mgh, TA;) as also ↓ دَمِيثٌ, (A,) and ↓ دَمْثٌ, or
↓ دَمَثٌ; the last also explained as a subst.,
meaning an even, or a soft, tract of land; app.
an inf. n. used as a subst.: (Mgh:) or دَمِثٌ [in
one copy of the S erroneously written دِمِثٌ, and
in another دِمْثٌ,] signifies a soft and sandy
place; and its pl. is دِمَاثٌ: (S:) or a place soft to
the tread; as also ↓ دَمَثٌ: and so this last applied
to a tract of sand (رَمْلَةٌ); as though it were an
inf. n. used as an اِسْم [here meaning an epithet;
wherefore it is used alike as masc. and fem. and
sing. and dual and pl.]: and [for this reason]
↓ دَمَثٌ signifies also plain, or soft, tracts of land;
pl. [of pauc.] أَدْمَاثٌ and [of mult.] دِمَاثٌ: (M:)
or دِمَاثٌ has this last meaning; and its sing. is
↓ دَمِثَةٌ [with ة added to transfer the word from
the category of epithets to that of substantives];
and دِمَاث consist of sands and of what are not
sands: دَمَائِثُ likewise is applied to what is [or
are] even and soft; and its sing. is ↓ دَمِثَةٌ [like as
خَرِبَةٌ is sing. of خَرَائِبُ]: (T: [but for دَمِثَةٌ, in
this last instance, I find ↓ دَمِيثَةٌ: if this be right,
the pl. is agreeable with analogy; but if دَمِثَةٌ be
the sing., the pl. is anomalous:]) and دَمِثٌ is
applied to sand, as meaning not cohering. (TA.)
It is said in a trad., مَالَ إِلَى دَمِثٍ فَبَالَ فِيهِ,
(Mgh,) or ↓ دَمْثٍ, (A, Mgh,) accord. to different
readings, i. e. [He turned to] a soft and even
place [and made water upon it]. (Mgh.) And
you say, ↓ نَزَلْنَا بِأَرْضٍ مَيْثَآءَ دَمْثَآءَ [We alighted, or
alighted and abode, in a tract of land even, or soft,
or soft and even]. (A.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (T,) (tropical:)  A man
easy in nature, or disposition, (T, M, TA,) and
generous; (T;) as also ↓ دَمِيثٌ: (TA:) and in
the same sense ↓ دَمِيثَةٌ is applied to a woman;
(T;) or دَمِثَةٌ; (TA;) she being likened to land
so termed, because such is the best, or most
productive, of land. (T, TA.) And دَمِثُ
الأَخْلَاقِ (tropical:)  A man easy in natural dispositions.
(A.)
