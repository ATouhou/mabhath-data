دغم1
دَغَمَ, aor.
دَغَمَ, (K,) inf. n. دَغْمٌ, (JK, S,) He,
or it, broke the nose, making the breach to extend into the interior. (JK, S, K. [So too accord.
to the explanation of the inf. n. in the KL;
though Golius renders it, and app. دَغَّمَ also, as
on the authority of the KL, “depressit nasum; ”
while Freytag follows him in thus rendering only
the latter verb; which I do not find in any
Lexicon.])
-A2-  Also, (M, K,) inf. n. as above,
(M, TA,) He covered a vessel. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  And,
said of rain, It covered, or overwhelmed, and
prevailed over, or subdued, the earth, or land; as
also ↓ ادغم. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And دَغَمَهُمْ, (S, K,) aor.
دَغَمَ;
(K;) and دَغِمَهُمْ, (S, K,) aor.
دَغَمَ; (K;) inf. n.
دَغْمٌ and دَغَمانٌ; (TA;) said of heat, (S, K,)
and of cold also, (JK, K,) It came upon them,
[properly] as though it were a thing that covered
them; syn. غَشِيَهُمْ; as also ↓ أَدْغَمَهُمْ. (S, K. [Golius,
app. misled by a wrong interpretation which I
find in the KL, (mentioned by him as one of his
authorities in this case, in addition to the S and
K,) explains these three verbs as meaning “ totum
corripuit, et deliquio animi affecit: ” and Freytag
has followed him herein.])
-A3-  [The inf. n.] دَغْمًا
is also used, (K, TA,) in a form of imprecation,
(TA,) as an imitative sequent to رَغْمًا [q. v.], and
is in like manner followed by سِنَّغْمًا, (K, TA,)
or شِنَّغْمًا. (TA.) And one says, فَعَلْتُ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى
رَغْمِهِ وَدَغْمِهِ وَشِنَّغْمِهِ [meaning I did that in spite
of him; or against his will]. (TA.)

أَدْغَمَ see above, in two places.
-A2-  ادغم الفَرَسَ
اللِّجَامَ He put the bit into the mouth of the
horse; (JK, Az, S, K;) as also ادغم اللِّجَامَ فِى
فَمِ الفَرَسِ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And hence, (Az, S, TA,)
though some say that the reverse is the case,
(TA,) ادغم الحَرْفَ (Az, S, K) فِى الحَرْفِ, (K,)
inf. n. إِدْغَامٌ, (JK, S,) He inserted [or incorporated] the letter into the letter; (JK, K, TA;)
as also ↓اِدَّغَمَهُ, (S, K,) [which is itself an
example of the incorporation of one letter
into another, being] originally اِدْتَغَمَهُ. (S, TA.)
-A3-  ادغمهُ, said of God, He blackened his face:
(K:) and i. q. أَرْغَمَهُ; (K, * TA;) both signify
(tropical:)  He did evil to him, and angered him: or the
former verb has the former of these significations,
explained in the K; and the latter verb signifies,
with its pronoun, “he angered him. ” (TA.) ―
-b2-
ادغمهُ إِلَى كَذَا He, or it, caused him to want
such a thing; (AA, TA in art. دمغ;) [and] so
ادغمهُ لِكَذَا; (L in art. جلد;) as also ادمغهُ.
(AA, L in art. جلد voce أَجْلَدَ, and TA in art.
دمغ.)
-A4-  ادغم فُلَانٌ Such a one vied, or strove,
with the people, or party, in hastening [to eat],
fearing lest they should be before him, and therefore ate the food without chewing. (K, * TA.)
[And أَدْمَغَ طَعَامَهُ, as explained in the TA in art.
دمغ, has a similar meaning.]

ادغامّ, inf. n. اِدْغِيمَامٌ, said of a horse, He
was of a colour inclining to blackness in his face
and lips, [or in his face and the part next the
lips,] blacker therein than in the other parts of
his body. (K.)
دَغَمٌ and ↓ دُغْمَةٌ, in a horse, [and in some other
animals, (see أَدْغَمُ,)] A colour inclining to blackness, (S, K,) in the face and the part next the
lips, (S,) or in the face and the lips, (K,) differing from, (S,) or blacker than, (K,) the colour of
the other parts of the body. (S, K.)
دُغْمَةٌ: see what next precedes.
دُغْمَانٌ, with damm, (S, K,) applied to a man,
(S,) Black: (S, K:) or black and big. (K.)
-A2-
Also a pl. of أَدْغَمُ [q. v.]. (TA.)
دُغَامٌ A pain in the fauces. (K.)
دَاغِمٌ an imitative sequent to رَاغِمٌ. (K, * TA.)
أَدْغَمُ A horse of a colour inclining to blackness,
(S, K,) or of a black colour, (Mgh,) in the face
and the part next the lips, (S,) or in the face and
the lips, (K,) or in the face and the muzzle,
(Mgh,) differing from, (S, Mgh,) or blacker
than, (K,) the colour of the other parts of the
body; (S, Mgh, K;) called in Pers. دَيْزَج [or
rather دِيزَهْ, from which دَيْزَجٌ is arabicized];
(AO, * S, Mgh, K;) in some instances, without
any admixture of خُضْرَة [here meaning dark, or
ashy, dust-colour]: (AO, TA:) it is also applied
as an epithet to a wolf: and the fem. is دَغْمَآءُ:
and the pl. is دُغْمٌ: (S:) the masc. is also applied
to a ram, meaning having any, the least, blackness; especially in the end of the nose and beneath
the chin: and the fem. to a ewe, meaning black
in the end of the nose and in the chin; (TA;) or,
thus applied, black in the face: (JK:) and the
masc. also signifies black in the nose: (JK, K:)
in which sense it has for its pl. دُغْمَانٌ: (TA:)
accord. to the K [and the JK], دُغْمٌ, a pl. of أَدْغَمُ,
signifies white; as though it had two contr.
meanings; but this is a mistranscription for دُعْمٌ,
with the unpointed ع. (TA.) It is said in a
prov., الذّئْبُ أَدْغَمُ [The wolf is blackish in the
face and in the part next the lips, not being so
in the other parts; or rather, is black in the
nose]: for, whether he lap from a vessel or not,
دُغْمَة is a necessary characteristic of the wolf,
[all] wolves being دُغْم; and therefore he is sometimes, or often, suspected of having lapped from
a vessel when he is [really] hungry: the prov. is
applied to him who is regarded with a wish for
the like of that which he has not obtained. (S.)
―
-b2-  Also One who snuffles; i. e., speaks from
[i. e. through] his nose; (JK, K, TA;) i. e. i. q.
أَخَنُّ. (TA.)
