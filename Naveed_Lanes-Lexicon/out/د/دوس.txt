aor. يَدُوسُ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. ديَاسَةٌ, (S, A, Mgh,)
or دَوْسٌ and دِيَاسٌ, but some say that دِيَاسٌ is
not of the language of the Arabs, and some say
that it is tropical, as though from دَاسَ in the
sense explained above, (Msb,) or the professors
of practical religion use it in the place of دِيَاسَةٌ
by a kind of license, relying upon the understanding of the hearer or reader, or do so erroneously, (Mgh,) He trod, or thrashed, (M, Mgh,
Msb,) the wheat, (Mgh, Msb,) or grain, (M,)
either by the feet of beasts, or by repeatedly
drawing over it the مِدْوَس [q. v. infrà] until it
became تِبْن [or cut straw]; (Mgh;) as also

tropical:]) conscendit et vehementer inivit eam.

-b7-  Hence, دَوْسٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The framing,
and dressing up, of deceit, guile, or circumvention: (As, A, TA:) [agreeably with which explanation the verb, دَاسَ, is probably used, though
not mentioned in the A nor in the TA:] or
simply, the act of deceiving, beguiling, circumventing, and practising artifice. (TA.) You say,
