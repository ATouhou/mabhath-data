دفلدِفْلٌ: see the following paragraph.
-A2-  Also
i. q. قَطِرَانٌ and زِفْتٌ [both app. here meaning
Tar, or liquid pitch]: (K:) or such as is thick:
mentioned in this art. by IF, and also as written
with ذ. (TA.)
دِفْلَى, (T, S, M, K, &c.,) accord. to those who
make the alif to be a sign of the fem. gender;
and دِفْلًى, accord. to those who make that letter to
be one of quasi-coordination; used alike as a sing.
and a pl.; (S;) and ↓ دِفْلٌ; (Ibn-'Abbád, K;)
[the first of these appellations applied in the present
day to The rose-bay, or laurel-bay; oleander,
nerium oleander, rhododendron, or rhododaphne:
and also to the common laurel:] a certain tree,
(T, M,) or plant, (S, K,) bitter, (T, S, M, K,)
very bitter, (TA,) and poisonous, (T,) green, and
beautiful in appearance, the blossom of which is
beautifully tinged, (M,) called in Persian خَرْزَهْرَهْ:
(K:) there is a river-kind, and a land-kind:
the leaves are like those of the حَمْقَآء [or gardenpurslane], but more slender; and the branches,
or twigs, are long, spreading over the ground;
at the leaves are thorns; and it grows in waste
places: the river-kind grows upon the banks
of rivers; its thorns are unconspicuous, or unapparent; its leaves are like those of the خِلَاف
[or salix Aegyptia] and of the almond, broad;
and the upper part of its stem is thicker than the
lower part thereof: (TA:) it is very deadly:
its blossom is like the red rose, (K,) very rough
(خشن جدّا [but this I think is a mistranscription
for حَسَنٌ جِدًّا very beautiful], and upon it is a
kind of tuft like hair: (TA:) its fruit is like
the خُرْنُوب [q. v.]; (K;) having an aperient,
or a deobstruent, property; and stuffed with a
substance like wool: (TA:) it is good for the
mange, or scab, and the itch (حِكَّة), used in the
manner of a liniment, (K,) and especially the
expressed juice of its leaves; (TA;) and for
pain of the knee and the back, (K,) of long
duration, (TA,) applied in the manner of a
poultice, or plaster; and for expelling fleas and
the [insect called] أَرَض, by the sprinkling of a
decoction thereof; and the rubbing over with
the heart thereof twelve times, after cleansing,
is good for removing the [malignant leprosy
termed] بَرَص; (K;) and its leaves put upon
hard tumours are very beneficial: but it is a
poison: [yet] sometimes it is mixed with wine
and rue, and given to be drunk, and saves from
the poisons of venomous reptiles: the Ra-ees
[Ibn-Seenà, or Avicenna,] says that it is perilous
by itself, and its blossom, to men, and to horses
and the like, and to dogs, but is beneficial when
made into a decoction with rue, and drunk:
(TA:) IAar says that the [trees termed] آء and
أَلَآء and حبر [app. a mistranscription for خَبْر, a
species of lote-tree,] are all called دِفْلَى. (T.)
AHn says that the زَنْد made from the دِفْلَى is
excellent for producing fire: and hence the prov.,
اِقْدَحْ بِدِفْلَى فِى مَرْخِ ثُمَّ شُدَّ بَعْدُ أَوْ أَرْخِ [Endeavour thou to produce fire with wood of the دفلى
upon wood of the مرخ: then tighten afterwards
or loosen]: (M:) said when one incites a bad
man against another bad man: (M, Meyd:) or,
accord. to IAar, said in relation to a man whom
one needs not to press, or importune. (Meyd.)
