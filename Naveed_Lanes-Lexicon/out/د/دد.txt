دددَدٌ, (S, A, K, [but in some copies of the S and
K written دَدّ, and said in the TA, in art ددن, to
be so written by some, though it is there implied
that this is of doubtful authority,]) without tesh-deed, (A, TA,) like يَدٌ, (MF,) Diversion, sport,
play, or such as is vain, or frivolous; (S, A, K;)
as also دَدًا, like قَفًا; and دَدنٌ, (S, K,) and ↓ دَدَدٌ:
(Ed-Demámeenee, CK:) but accord. to IB, it
should be mentioned in art. ددن [in which دَدَنٌ
is mentioned again in the S and K], or art. ددو
[in which دَدًا is mentioned again together with
دَدٌ and دَدَنٌ]. (L.) [The proper place of دَدٌ
seems to be art. ددو (like as art. اخو is the proper
place in which أَخٌ should be mentioned), as well
as of دَدًا; and the proper place of دَدَنٌ, art.
ددن.] Hence, (A,) مَا أَنَا مِنْ دَدٍ وَلَا الدَّدُ مِنِّى [I
have no concern with diversion, &c., nor has diversion, &c., any concern with me]: a saying [of
Mohammad] occurring in a trad. (S, A.)
-A2-  Also
A space (حِينٌ) of time. (K.)
دَدَدٌ: see above.
دَدِدٌ [meaning Diverting himself, sporting, playing, or doing so in a vain, or frivolous, manner,]
occurs [accord. to one reading] in a verse of Et-
Tirimmáh [cited in this art. in the K, and in the
present work in art. طرب, as an ex. of اِسْتَطْرَبَ]:
the poet has annexed to it a third د because an
epithet is not susceptible of variation unless comprising three letters: (K:) or such is the opinion
of F; but this requires consideration. (MF.)
