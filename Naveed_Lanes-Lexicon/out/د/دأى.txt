دَأْىٌ and ↓ دِئِىٌّ and ↓ دُئِىٌّ, (M, K,) the last
said by IB, on the authority of As, to be pl. of
[the n. un.] ↓ دَأْيَةٌ, of the measure فُعُولٌ, [originally دُؤُوىٌ,] (TA,) The vertebræ of the كَاهِل
[or withers (app. of a camel)] and of the back:
or the cartilages of the breast: or the ribs thereof,
where it meets the side: (M, K:) or ↓ الدَّأَيَاتُ
signifies the ribs of [i. e. within] the shoulderblade, three on either side; (IAar, M, K;) sing.
↓ دَأْيَةٌ: (M:) or ↓ دَأْيَةٌ, (T,) or دَأْىٌ, (S,) signifies the part of the camel against which lies the
[piece of wood called] ظَلِفَة of the saddle, and which
is [often] galled thereby: (T, S:) or دَأْىٌ is the
pl. [or coll. gen. n.] of ↓ دَأْيَةٌ, and signifies the
vertebræ of the withers, in the part between the
two shoulder-blades, of the camel, peculiarly;
(Lth, T;) and the pl. [of دَأْيَةٌ] is ↓ دَأَيَاتٌ: (Lth,
T, S:) or the دأيات are the vertebræ of the neck:
or the vertebræ of the spine: (AO, T:) or the
two ribs next to the وَاهِنَتَانِ are called the دَأْيَتَانِ:
AZ says that the Arabs knew not the term دأيات
in relation to the neck, but they knew it in relation to the ribs, as signifying six [ribs] next to
the stabbing-place of the camel, three on either
side; and this is correct: (T:) [and it is said in
the L, in art. جنح, that دَأْىٌ signifies the ribs of
the back, of a man, which are called the جَوَانِح,
pl. of جَانِحَةٌ, six in number, three on the right
and three on the left:] the pl. of دَأْىٌ [or rather
the quasi-pl. n.] is دَئِىٌّ, like as ضَئِينٌ is of ضَأْنٌ,
and مَعِيزٌ of مَعْزٌ: (S:) and, accord. to IB, دُئِىٌّ
is a pl. of ↓ دَأْيَةٌ, as mentioned above, meaning
the vertebræ of the neck. (TA.)
