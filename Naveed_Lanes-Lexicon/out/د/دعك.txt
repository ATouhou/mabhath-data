مِدْعَكٌ: see the following paragraph. [For أَلَدُّ
in the K, Golius seems to have found in his copy
of that Lexicon آلَةُ; for he has explained مِدْعَكٌ,
as on the authority of the K, by “ Instrumentum
quo quid defricatur aut levigatur; ” a meaning
which it may possibly have, as agreeable with
analogy, but for which I find no authority.]

adversary, or antagonist, vehement in contention,
dispute, or litigation. (IDrd, K, TA.)
