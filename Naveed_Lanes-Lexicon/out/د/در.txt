poet, it may be rendered divinely art thou gifted!]
a man's gift [or the like] was originally thus
likened to the milk of a camel; and then this
phrase became so common as to be used as expressive of admiration of anything: (Aboo-Bekr,
TA:) it was first said by a man who saw another
milking camels, and wondered at the abundance
of their milk: (ISd, TA:) the thing alluded to
therein is attributed to God to indicate that none
other could be its author. (TA.) You say also,

attributed his excellence as a horseman!]. (Msb.)
And, in dispraise, (S,) دَرُّهُ ↓ لَا دَرَّ May his good,
or wealth, not be, or become, much, or abundant!
(S, A, TA:) or may his work not thrive! (K.)
El-Mutanakhkhil says,
لَا دَرَّ دَرِّىَ إِنْ أَطْعَمْتُ نَازِلَهُمْ
قِرْفَ الحَتِّىِ وَعِنْدِى البُرُّ مَكْنُوزُ
[May my wealth not become abundant, or may
my work not thrive, if I feed him among them
who is a guest with the rind of حَتِىّ (q. v.) when

K;) and its abundance or abounding: (S, Msb,
K:) as also ↓ دَرَّةٌ: (L:) or this latter signifies a
single flow, or stream, of milk. (Msb.) Hence
the prov., لَا آتِيكَ مَااخْتَلَفَتِ الدِّرَّةُ وَالجِرَّةُ I will
not come to thee as long as the flow of milk and
the cud go [the former] downwards and [the
latter] upwards. (TA. [See also جِرَّةُ.]) ―

فِرْقِلَّة: or a whip made of a strip, or broad strip,
(see 1 in art. خفق,) of thick and tough hide, or

(by the latter as from the S and K, in neither of
which is any such explanation found,) as “ strophium ex fune aliave re contortum, aut nervus
taurinus, similisve res, quibus percuti solet: ”]
