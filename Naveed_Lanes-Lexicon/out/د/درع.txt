اِدَّرَعَ He (a man) clad himself with a دِرْعٌ
(S K) of iron [i. e. a coat of mail]; (K;) as
also ↓ تدرّع. (S, K.) And اِدَّرَعَتْ She (a woman)
clad herself with a دِرْع, (S, K,) i. e. a قَمِيص [or
shift]. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  ادّرع مِدْرَعَةً, and ↓ تدرّعها, and
↓ تَمَدْرَعَهَا, (Kh,) and ↓ تدرّع alone, (S,) and
↓ تَمَدْرَعَ, (S, K,) but this last is of weak authority, (S,) He clad himself with a مِدْرَعَة [q. v.].
(S, K,) ―
-b3-  ادّرع فُلَانٌ اللَّيْلِ (tropical:)  Such a one entered
into the darkness of the night, journeying therein;

غمد.) Hence the saying, (TA,) شَمِّرْ ذَيْلًا وَادَّرِعْ
لَيْلًا (tropical:)  Use thou prudence, or precaution, or good
judgment, and journey all the night. (S, K.)
[See also art. شمر.] ―

Q. Q. 2
تَمَدْرَعَ: see 8, in two places.
دِرْعٌ A coat of mail; syn. زَرَدِّيَةٌ: (IAth, Msb,
TA:) [or a coat of defence of any kind; being a
term applied in the S and K &c. to a يَلَبَة, i. e.
a coat of defence of skins, or of camel's hide:]
and also, of plate-armour: (AO, in his book on
the دِرْع and بَيْضَة, cited in the TA voce مِغْفَرٌ:)
[but the first is the most general, and proper,
meaning:] as meaning a دِرْع of iron, it is fem.;
(S, Mgh, K *) or mostly so; (Msb;) but sometimes masc.: (K:) AO says that it is masc. and
fem.; (S, TA;) and so Lh: (TA:) pl. أَدْرُعٌ and
أَدْرَاعٌ and دُرُوعٌ; (S, Msb, K;) the first and second,
pls. of pauc.; the third, a pl. of mult. (S.) The
dim. is ↓ دُرَيْعٌ, which is anomalous, (S, Msb, K,)
for by rule it should be with ة; (S;) or this
may be [a regular form] of the dial. of those who
make the word masc.; and some say ↓ دُرَيْعَةٌ.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  Also A woman's قَمِيص [or shift]; (S,
Msb, K;) a garment, or piece of cloth, in the
middle of which a woman cuts an opening for
the head to be put through, and to which she puts
arms [or sleeves], and the two openings of which
[at the two sides] she sews up: (T, TA:) or a
woman's garment which is worn above the قَمِيص:
or, accord. to El-Hulwánee, one of which the
opening for the head to pass through extends
towards, or to, the bosom; whereas the قميص is
one of which the slit is towards, or to, the
shoulder-joint; but this [says Mtr] I find not in
the lexicons: (Mgh:) a small garment which a
young girl wears in her house, or chamber, or
tent: (TA:) as meaning a woman's دِرْع, it is
masc., (Lh, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) only; (Lh;) or
sometimes fem.: (TA:) pl. أَدْرَاعٌ. (S, K.) [See
a verse cited voce مِجْوَلٌ.]
دَرَعٌ Whiteness in the breast of a sheep, or goat,
and in its نَحْر [or part where it is slaughtered,
but وَنَحْرِهَا, in the K, is probably a mistranscription, for وَنَحْوِهَا, meaning and the like thereof,
i. e., of the sheep, or goat], and blackness in the
thigh. (Lth, K.) [See also 1; and see دُرْعَةٌ.]
لَيَالٍ دُرَعٌ: see أَدْرَعُ.
دُرْعَةٌ, in a horse, and in a sheep or goat, Blackness of the head, and whiteness [of the other
parts]: or, accord. to some, blackness of the head
and neck: a subst. from دَرِعَ [q. v.]. (Msb.) ―
-b2-
See also أَدْرَعُ, in the middle of the paragraph.
دِرْعِيَّةٌ, applied to an arrow-head or the like,
Penetrating into, or piercing through, the coats
of mail: pl. دَرَاعِىُّ. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
دُرَيْعٌ and دُرَيْعَةٌ: see دِرْعٌ.
دُرَّاعَةٌ: see مِدْرَعَةٌ, in four places.
دَارِعٌ Having, or possessing, a دِرْع [or coat of
mail]: (Mgh:) or a man having upon him a
دِرْع; (S, K;) as though having, or possessing,
a دِرْع; [being properly a possessive epithet] like
لَابِنٌ and تَامِرٌ. (S.)
أَدْرَعُ, applied to a horse, and to a sheep or
goat, Having a black head, the rest being white:
(S, Msb, * K:) or, as some say, having a black
head and neck, (Msb, TA,) the rest being white:
(TA:) or having a white head and neck, the rest
being black: (TA:) fem. دَرْعَآءُ: (S, Msb:) pl.
دُرْعٌ: (S:) or دَرْعَآءُ signifies having what is termed
دَرَعٌ [q. v.]; applied to a sheep or goat, (K,) and
to a mare: (TA:) or a sheep or goat black in
the body, and white in the head: or black in the
neck and head, the rest of her being white: or,
accord. to AZ, a ewe having a black neck: or,
accord. to Aboo-Sa'eed, sheep or goats differing
in colour: or, accord. to ISh, black except in
having the neck white: and red [or brown], but
having the neck white: and also, having the head
with the neck white: accord. to Az, the right
explanation is that given by AZ, meaning having
the fore part black; being likened to the nights
termed دُرَعٌ; or the latter are likened to the
former: and hence, (TA,) ―
-b2-  لَيْلَةٌ دَرْعَآءُ (tropical:)  A night
of which the moon rises at the dawn, (K,) or at
the commencement of the dawn; the rest thereof
being black, and dark. (TA.) And ↓ لَيَالٍ دُرَعٌ,
(S, K,) said by AHát to have been heard by him
only on the authority of AO, but so accord. to
As and A 'Obeyd and AHeyth, (TA,) and دُرْعٌ;
(K;) the former contr. to rule, for by
rule it should be دُرْعٌ, its sing. being دَرْعَآءُ;
(A 'Obeyd, S;) or, accord. to AHeyth, you say
ثَلَاثٌ دُرَعٌ وَثَلَاثٌ ظُلَمٌ, and دُرَعٌ and ظُلَمٌ are pls.
of ↓ دُرْعَةٌ and ظُلْمَةٌ, not of دَرْعَآءُ and ظَلْمَآءُ; and
Az says that this is correct and regular; but IB
says that دَرْعَآءُ has دُرَعٌ for its pl. for the purpose
of assimilation to ظُلَمٌ in the saying ثَلَاثٌ ظُلَمٌ
وَثَلَاثٌ دُرَعٌ, and that no other instance had been
heard by him of a word of the measure فَعْلَآءُ
having a pl. of the measure فُعَلٌ; (TA;) (tropical:)  Three
nights of the month which follow those called
البِيضُ; (As, S, K; *) namely, the sixteenth and
seventeenth and eighteenth nights; (TA;) because
of the blackness of their first parts, and the whiteness of the rest thereof: (S, K:) there is no
difference in what As and AZ and ISh say respecting them: but some say that they are the
thirteenth and fourteenth and fifteenth; because
part of them is black and part of them white:
[this, however, seems to have originated from a
misunderstanding of an explanation running thus;
three nights of the month which follow those
called البِيض, which, meaning the latter, are the
thirteenth &c.; for the thirteenth and fourteenth
and fifteenth are all white:] or, accord. to AO,
اللَّيَالِى الدُّرَعُ signifies the nights of which the fore
parts are black and the latter parts white, of the
end of the month; and those of which the fore
parts are white and the latter parts black, of the
commencement of the month. (TA.) ―
-b3-  أَدْرَعُ also
signifies (assumed tropical:)  One whose father is free, or an Arab,
and whose mother is a slave; syn. هَجِينٌ; (K;)
as also مُعَلْهَجٌ. (TA.) And قَوْمٌ دُرْعٌ (tropical:)  A people,
or company of men, of whom half are white and
half black. (TA.)
مِدْرَعٌ: see the following paragraph.
مِدْرَعَةٌ A certain garment, [a tunic,] like that
called ↓ دُرَّاعَةٌ, never of anything but wool, (Lth,
K,) [and having sleeves; for] mention is made,
in a trad., of a مدرعة narrow in the sleeve;
wherefore the wearer, in performing the ablution
termed وُضُوْء, put forth his arm from beneath the
مدرعة, and so performed that ablution: (TA:)
accord. to some, the ↓ درّاعة is a [garment of the
kind called] جُبَّة, slit in the fore part; (TA;)
[thus resembling a kind of جُبَّة worn by persons
in Northern Africa, reaching to, or below, the
knees, and having the two front edges sewed
together from the bottom, or nearly so, to about
the middle of the breast: it is said in the MA to
be a wide vest or shirt; a large جُبَّة: and the
مِدْرَعَة is there said to be a woollen دُرَّاعَة; a woollen tunic: El-Makreezee (cited by De Sacy in his
“ Chrest. Arabe,” 2nd ed., vol. i., p. 125,) describes the ↓ دراّعة as a garment worn in Egypt
particularly by Wezeers, slit in the fore part to
near the head of the heart, with buttons and
loops: Golius describes it as “ tunica gossipina,
fere grossior; ” adding, “estque exterior tum
virilis tum muliebris; ” as on the authority of J,
who says nothing of the kind, and of the Loghat
Neamet-Allah: and as epomis, seu amiculum
quod humeris injicitur; on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof: J only says,] the ↓ مِدْرَع and مِدْرَعَة are
one; and ↓ دُرَّاعَةٌ is sing. of, or signifies one of
what are called, دَرَارِيعُ: (S:) the pl. of مدرعة is
مَدَارِعُ. (MA.)
-A2-  Also The [appendage called]
صُفَّة [q. v.] of a رَحْل [or camel's saddle], when
the heads of the وَاسِطَة [or fore part (Az says the
وَسَط, accord. to the TA,)] and the آخِرَة [or hinder
part] appear from [above] it. (K.)
