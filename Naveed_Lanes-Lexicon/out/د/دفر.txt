دَفْرٌ (T, S, M, A, Msb, K) and ↓ دَفَرٌ, (IAar,
M, A, K,) the former a simple subst., and the
latter an inf. n., (Msb,) or both inf. ns., (A,)

M, A, Msb, K:) never used to signify a sweet
smell: (M:) accord. to Aboo- ” Alee El-Kálee,
↓ دَفَرٌ has the above-mentioned signification; but
دَفْرٌ signifies pungency of odour, whether stinking
or sweet: other authorities, however, assert,
accord. to what is transmitted from them, that
the word signifying intense pungency of odour,
whether sweet or bad, is ذَفَرٌ, with ذ, and with two
fet-hahs, whence مِسْكٌ أَذْفَرُ: I Aar says that ↓ ذَفَرٌ
signifies stink, or stench; and ذَفْرٌ, baseness, or
vileness; but this is not known on any other
authority. (M, L, TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence the saying of
'Omar, وَدَفْرَاهْ, meaning [Alas, what stench! i. e.,
(assumed tropical:)  Alas, what an abominable thing! i. e.] وَانَتْنَاهْ:
(A 'Obeyd, T, S, M:) or it means Alas, what
baseness, or vileness! (IAar, T, M.) ―
-b3-  Hence
also the phrase, دَفْرًا لَهُ, meaning [May God make
stench to cleave to him, or it! i. e., (assumed tropical:)  Fy, or shame,
upon him, or it! i. e.] نَتْنًا لَهُ: (S, Mgh:) and
لِمَا يَجِىْءُ بِهِ فُلَانٌ↓دَفْرًا دَفِرًا, (T, * S, M,) meaning
[May foul stench cleave to that which such a one
doth! i. e., (assumed tropical:)  Foul shame upon it! i. e.] نَتْنًا;
(S, M;) but in an intensive sense; (M;) said in
declaring a man's case, or affair, to be bad, or
abominable. (T, S.) ―

(S, K, TA.) ―
-b5-  And أُمُّ دَفْرٍ, (T, S, A, K,) written by Aboo-'Alee El-Kálee ↓ أُمُّ دَفَرٍ, but this is
