دهقنQ. 1
دَهْقَنَ: see the next paragraph.
-A2-  دَهْقَنُوهُ,
(inf. n. دَهْقَنَةٌ, TK,) They made him a دِهْقَان.
(K.) El-'Ajjáj says,
دُهْقِنَ بِالتَّاجِ وَبِالتَّسْوِيرِ
[He was made a دهقان by receiving the تاج
(meaning either crown or turban) and by being
decked with bracelets]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  دَهْقَنَ الطَّعَامَ,
(A'Obeyd, TA,) inf. n. دَهْقَنَةٌ, with which دَهْمَقَةٌ
is syn., (As, TA,) He made the food soft, or
delicate: (As, A'Obeyd, TA:) because softness,
or delicacy, of food is from الدَّهْقَنَةُ [as meaning
التَّدَهْقُن]. (As, TA.)
Q. 2
تَدَهْقَنَ He was, or became, a دِهْقَان: (S,
K, Mgh, TA:) or he had, or possessed, much
wealth; as also ↓ دَهْقَنَ [app. in both of these
senses]: (Msb:) derived from دِهْقَانٌ. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-
Also He affected, or feigned, or made a show of,
sharpness or quickness of intellect, cleverness,
ingeniousness, skilfulness, knowledge, or intelligence; syn. تَكَيَّسَ. (TA.)
دَهْقَنَةٌ [inf. n. of Q. 1: and signifying The state,
or condition, of a دِهْقَان;] a subst from دِهْقَانٌ;
(JK, K;) derived from the latter word. (Mgh.)
You say, لَهُ دَهْقَنَةٌ بِمَوْضِعِ كَذَا [He has a state,
or condition, which is that of a دِهْقَان in such a
place. (S.)
دِهْقَانٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,) also written
دُهْقَانٌ, (JK, Msb, K,) in [some of] the copies of
the S written [دِهْقَانٌ and دَهْقَانٌ,] with kesr and
fet-h, [thus written in one of my copies of the S,]
and said by AO [as there cited] to be like قرطاس,
which is written with each of the three vowels,
(TA,) an arabicized word, (S, Msb, K,) from the
Pers. [دِهْ “a town or village” and خَانْ “a prince
or lord”]; (TA;) if derived from تَدَهْقَنَ, (Kh,
Sb, S,) i. e. if the ن be regarded as radical,
perfectly decl. [and written as above]; (Kh, Sb,
S;) but if derived from الدَّهْقُ, imperfectly decl.
[and written دِهْقَانُ &c.], because of the measure
فعلانُ; (S;) [but this statement relates especially
to the measure فَعْلَان, with fet-h to the ف; except
in the case of a proper name; and an epithet of
this measure, moreover, that forms its fem. by the
addition of ة, as دهقان does, is perfectly decl.;
and it should be observed also, that,] accord.
to IJ, دهقان is of the measure فعلال, from
تَدَهْقَنَ, and there is no instance, in the language,
of the measure تَفَعْلَنَ; (Har p. 102;) it signifies
The headman, or chief, of a village or town:
(Es-Sem'ánee, Msb, TA: [agreeably with the
Pers. original:]) or the proprietor thereof, in
Khurásán and El-' Irák: (Es-Sem'ánee, TA:)
or, as used by the Arabs, a great man of the
unbelievers of the ' Ajam [or Persians]: but they
disdained this appellation: (Mgh:) Lth says that
it is a nickname, or name of reproach: (TA:) it
became predominantly applied to such of them as
was of the people of the districts of cultivated
land and of villages or towns: and then to anyone possessing much land or other immoveable
property: (Mgh:) [it signifies generally a dweller,
or one having a fixed abode, in a district of
cultivated land, or in a village or town of such a
district; a rustic; a husbandman:] or it signifies
a chief, headman, or person in authority, over the
husbandmen, or peasants, of the 'Ajam [or Persians]: and the headman of a province: (K:)
and a possessor of land or other immoveable
property: (Msb:) and a merchant: (Msb, K:)
and one who manages affairs firmly, or strongly,
with sharpness: (K:) the fem. is with ة: (JK,
Mgh, K:) and the pl. is دَهَاقِينُ (Msb, K) and
دَهَاقِنَةٌ. (K.) [See a verse cited voce جَذَا in art.
جذو. The same verse, but with قَرْيَتِى (my
village or town) in the place of قَرْيَةٍ, is also cited
in the TA in the present art.]
