دَبُجَ [or
دَبِجَ, as will be shown below],
(L,) inf. n. دَبْجٌ, (L, K,) [not دَبَجٌ and دَبَجَةٌ as
in the Lexicons of Golius and Freytag,] He
variegated, decorated, embellished, adorned, or
ornamented: (L, K: *) [and so ↓ دبّج, inf. n.
تَدْبِيجٌ, occurring in the TA in art. نمش; but
app. in an intensive sense.] And [hence,] دَبَجَ
الأَرْضَ, (A, L, Msb,) aor.

دَبَّجَ see above, in two places. [Accord. to
Golius, (for III. is inadvertently put in his Lex.
for II.,) as on the authority of the S and K, in
neither of which is the verb mentioned, “Veste
ديباج alium ornavit. ”]
مَا بِالدَّارِ دِبِّيجٌ, (ISk, S, A,) or فِى الدَّارِ, (K,)
(tropical:)  There is not in the house any one: (ISk, S, A,
K:) دِبِّيجٌ is not used otherwise than in a negative phrase: IJ derives it from دِيبَاجٌ; because
men adorn the earth: (TA:) [Z says,] it is
from دَبَجَ, like سِكِّيتٌ from سَكَتَ; because men
adorn houses: (A:) Abu-l-'Abbás says that
دِبِّيحٌ is more chaste than دِبِّيجٌ: (TA:) [ISk
says, or J, for the passage is ambiguous,]
A'Obeyd doubted respecting the ج and the ح;
and I asked respecting this word, in the desert,
a company of the Arabs thereof, and they said,
مَا فِى الدَّارِ دِبِّىٌّ, and nothing more; but I have
found in the handwriting of Aboo-Moosà El-
Hámid, ما فى الدار دِبِّيجٌ, with ج, on the authority of Th: (S:) AM says that the ج in دِبِّيٌج
is substituted for the [latter] ى in دِبِّىٌّ, in like
manner as they say مُرِّىٌّ and مُرِّجٌّ &c. (TA.)
دُبَيْبِيجٌ: see the next paragraph, near the
end.
دِيبَاجٌ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,) or دَيْبَاجٌ,
(Th,) or both, (IAar, A'Obeyd,) the latter
having been sometimes heard, (IAar,) or the
latter is post-classical, (A'Obeyd,) or wrong,
(AZ,) a word of well-known meaning, (K,)
[Silk brocade;] a certain kind of cloth, or garment, made of إِبْرِيسَم [i. e. silk, or raw silk]:

decorated, or embellished: (Mgh, Msb:) a kind

the authority of the S and K, in neither of
which is the word explained at all, “vestis
serica: imprimis picta, pec. Attalica, auro intexta:] derived from دَبَجَ: (Ks:) or it is a
Pers. word, (Kr, S, A,) arabicized; (Kr, S, A,
Msb, K;) so some say, and from it دَبَجَ is
derived; (Msb;) originally دِيبَاىْ, or دِيبَا;
(Kr;) [or rather دِيبَاهْ, for the change of the
final ه into ج in arabicized words from the Pers.
is very common;] or دِيوْ بَافْ, i. e. “ the weaving
of the deevs, or jinn, or genii: ” (Shifá el-Ghaleel:)
pl. دَيَابِيجُ and دَبَابِيجُ; (S, Msb, K;) the latter
being from the supposed original form of the
sing., i. e. دِبَّاجٌ; (S, Msb;) like دَنَانِيرُ [pl. of
دِينَارٌ, which is supposed to be originally دِنَّارٌ]:
and in like manner is formed the dim. [↓ دُيَيْبِيجٌ
and ↓ دُبَيْبِيجٌ]. (S.) ―

exs. are given.]) ―
