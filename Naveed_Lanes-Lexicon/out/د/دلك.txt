or rubbed it and pressed it; and particularly, a
person's body and limbs, in the bath: its proper
meaning, however, is, he rubbed it, or rubbed it

signifying he rubbed it much or well on the anthority of the KL; but it is not in my copy of
that work.] You say, دَلَكَ الثَّوْبَ He rubbed, or
rubbed and pressed, the garment, or piece of cloth,

انْفَرَكَ قِشْرُهُ عَنْ حَبِّهِ [I rubbed the ears of corn

دَلُكَ, (Msb,) inf. n. دُلُوكٌ, (S, Mgh,
&c.,) (tropical:)  The sun set; (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.;)
accord. to Z, because he who looks at it rubs
(يَدْلُكُ) his eyes, so that it is as though it were the

so that the beholder almost required, when looking
at it, to contract the rays from his eyes with the

also, Msb) the sun declined from the meridian,
or midheaven, (I'Ab, Fr, Zj, Az, S, * Mgh, *
Msb, K, &c.,) at noon; (I'Ab, Fr, Zj, Az;) and
in like manner, النُّجُومُ the stars. (Msb.) Az
says that, in his opinion, the words of the Kur
[xvii. 80] أَقِمَ الصَّلَاةَ لِدُلُوكِ الشَّمْسِ (TA) mean
Perform thou prayer from the declining of the
sun at noon: so that the command expressed by
these words with what follows them includes the
five prayers: (Mgh, * TA:) for by the دلوك are
included the first prayer [of noon] and that of the
عَصْر; and by the غَسَق of night, the two prayers
[of sunset and nightfall] of which each is called
عِشَآء; and by the قُرْآن of the فَجْر, the prayer of
daybreak: if you make the دلوك to be the setting,
the command is restricted to three prayers: in the
language of the Arabs, دُلُوكٌ is said to be syn.
with زَوَالٌ; and therefore the sun is said to be
دَالِكَةٌ when it is declining at noon and when it is
setting. (TA.) [Respecting the phrase دَلَكَتْ بَرَاحِ
or بِرَاحِ, accord. to different readings, occurring at
the end of a verse, see بَرَاحِ, and see also رَاحَةٌ in
art. روح.] It is said in [one of the works entitled]
the “ Nawádir el-Aaráb,” that دَلَكَتِ الشَّمْسُ signifies The sun became high; like دَمَكَت and عَلَت
and اِعْتَلَت. (TA.)

or defer, with his wife?], meaning, in the matter
of the dowry; and he answered, “Yes, if he be in
