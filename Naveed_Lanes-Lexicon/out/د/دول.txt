دَالَ i. q. دَارَ. (TA.) You say, دالتِ الأَيَّامُ,
(S, Msb, K,) aor. تَدُولُ, (Msb,) inf. n. دَوْلٌ,
(KL,) meaning دَارَت; (S, Msb, K;) [i. e.] The
days came round [in their turns]. (KL.) ―
-b2-
دَوْلٌ also signifies The changing of time, or
fortune, from one state, or condition, to another;
(K;) and so دَوْلَةٌ. (TA.) [Hence,] one says,
دالت لَهُ الدَّوْلَةُ [The turn of fortune was, or
became, in his favour; or] good fortune came to
him: and دالت عَلَيْهِ الدَّوْلَةُ [The turn of fortune
was, or became, against him; or] good fortune
departed from him. (MA.) ―
-b3-  [Golius assigns
to دال, with دَوْلَةٌ for its inf. n., as on the authority of the S and KL, two significations app.
from two meanings of دَوْلَةٌ, one of which he
seems to have misunderstood, and to neither of
which do I find any corresponding verb: they
are “ Obivit alter alterum in bello: ” and “ superior
evasit. ” There are many inf. ns. that have no
corresponding verbs.] ―
-b4-  دال, aor. يَدُوِلُ, (T, K,)
inf. n. دَوْلٌ and دَالَةٌ, (K,) or دَوْلَةٌ, (T,) He
became notorious [either in a bad or in a good
sense]; expl. by صَارَ شُهْرَةً, (IAar, T, K,) i. e.
مَشْهُورًا. (TK.) ―
-b5-  دال الثَّوْبُ, aor. يَدُولُ, The
garment, or piece of cloth, was, or became, old, and
worn out. (AZ, S.) [Hence,] جَعَلَ وُدُّهُ يَدُولُ
(tropical:)  His love, or affection, was beginning to become,
or at the point of becoming, worn out. (AZ, S,
TA.) ―
-b6-  See also 7.
2
دوّل He wrote a د. (TA.)
3
داول, [inf. n. مُدَاوَلَةٌ,] He made to come
round [by turns, or to be by turns]: hence the
saying in the Kur [iii. 134], و تِلْكَ الْأَيَّامُ نُدَاوِلُهَا
بَيْنَ النَّاسِ And those days, we make them to come
round [by turns] to men: (S, * K, * TA:) or this
means, we dispense them by turns to men; (Bd,
Jel;) to these one time, and to these another;
(Bd;) or one day to one party, and one day to
another. (Jel.) You say, دَاوَلْتُ الشَّىْءَ بَيْنَهُمْ
↓ فَتَدَاوَلُوهُ [I dispensed the thing among them by
turns, and they had, or received, or took, it by
turns]. (Bd on the passage of the Kur quoted
above.) مُدَاوَلَةٌ also signifies The giving a turn
of fortune, or good fortune. (KL. [See what
next follows.])
4
ادالهُ, (M, K,) inf. n. إِدَالَةٌ, (T, TA,) [signifying He gave him a turn of good fortune, or a
turn to prevail over another in war, &c.,] is
from الدَّوْلَةُ. (T, M, K, TA. [See what next precedes.]) Hence, [in the CK from الدُّولَة,] the
saying, أَدَالَنَا اللّٰهُ مِنْ عَدُوِّنَا [God gave us, or may
God give us, a turn to prevail over our enemy].
(S, K.) And أَدَالَكَ اللّٰهُ مِنْ عَدُوِّكَ and عَلَى عَدُوِّكَ,
i. e. جَعَلَ لَكَ عَلَيْهِ دَوْلَةً [May God appoint thee,
or give thee, a turn to prevail over thine enemy].
(Ham p. 547.) And ادال اللّٰهُ زَيْدًا مِنْ عَمْرٍو
[God gave to Zeyd a turn to have the superiority
over 'Amr;] i. e. God took away the turn of
good fortune, or the good fortune, (الدولة,) from
'Amr, and gave it to Zeyd. (Har p. 118.)
Hence, also, (TA,) El-Hajjáj said, إِنَّ الأَرْضَ
سَتُدَالُ مِنَّا كَمَا أُدِلْنَا مِنْهَا [Verily the earth will
be given (?) turn to prevail over us, like as we have
been given a turn to prevail over it]; (Lth, T,
TA;) meaning that it will consume us, like as
we have consumed [of] it. (T, TA.) And
[hence] إِدَالَةٌ signifies غَلَبَةٌ [or Victory]: (S, K:)
or [rather], as some say, it signifies نُصْرَةٌ [i. e.
aid against an enemy]: (Har ubi suprà:) you
say, اَللّٰهُمَ أَدِلْنِى عَلَى فُلَانٌ O God, aid me against
such a one. (S, and Har ubi suprà. [In the
former, وَانْصُرْنِىعَلَيْهِ, as an explicative adjunct:
in the latter, اى نصِّرنى عليه, for انْصُرْنِى.])
6
تَدَاوَلُوهُ They took it, or had it, by turns.
(S, Msb, K. See 3.) You say, تَدَاوَلْنَا الأَمْرَ We
took [or did] the affair by turns. (M.) And
تَدَاوَلْنَا العَمَلَ وَ الأَمْرَبَيْنَنَا We did the work, and
the thing, or affair, by turns, among us. (T.)
And تَدَاوَلُوا البَاطِلَ They took it by turns to say,
or to do, that which was false, wrong, vain,
futile, or the like; syn. تَبَطَّلُوا بَيْنَهُمْ. (Az and K
in art. بطل.) And تَدَاوَلَتْهُ الأَيْدِى The hands
took it by turns. (S.) And تَدَاوَلَتِ الرِّيَاحُ رَسْمَ
الدَّارَ The winds blew by turns upon, or over, the
remains that marked the site of the house [so as
to efface them]; one time from the south, and
another time from the north, and another time
from the east, and another time from the west.
(Az, TA in art. عور.) And, of a thing, you say,
يُتَدَاوَلُ (T) or يُتَدَاوَلُ بِهِ (S) [meaning It is
taken, or done, by turns]. And تُدُوْوِلَتِ الأَرْضُ
بِالرَّعْىِ [The land was pastured on by turns].
(S and K in art. وظب.) [تَدَاوَلُوهُ also signifies
They made frequent use of it; i. e., used it time
after time, or turn after turn; namely, a word
or phrase: but perhaps in this sense it is postclassical: see an ex. in De Sacy's “ Chrest.
Arabe,” sec. ed., p. 141 of the Arabic text.]
And تَدَاوَلَتِ الأَشْيَآءُ The things alternated; or
succeeded one another by turns, one taking the
place of another: (L in art. نسخ:) and [in like
manner] الأَزْمَنَةُ [the times]. (Msb and K in that
art.) [See also 6 in art دفو.]
7
اندال القَوْمُ The people, or party, removed,
or shifted, from one place to another. (S.) ―
-b2-
اندال مَا فِىبَطْنِهِ What was in his belly, (M, K,)
of intestines or peritonæum, (M,) came forth,
(M, K,) in consequence of its being pierced.
(M.) ―
-b3-  And اندال It (the belly) became wide,
and near, or approaching, to the ground. (M, K.)
Also (K) It (the belly) was, or became, flaccid,
flabby, or pendulous; (S, O, K;) and so ↓ دَالَ.
(K.) ―
-b4-  And It (a thing) dangled, or moved to
and fro; and hung. (M, K.)
دَالٌ One of the letters of the alphabet, (د,) the
place of utterance of which is near to that of ت:
masc. and fem.; so that you say دَالٌ حَسَنٌ and
حَسَنَةٌ [a beautiful د]: the pl. is أَدْوَالٌ if masc.,
and دَالَاتٌ [if fem.; the latter the more common].
(TA.)
-A2-  Also A fat woman. (Kh, TA.)
-A3-
See also دَالَةٌ.
دَوْلٌ an inf. n. of دَالَ in senses explained above.
(K, KL.)
-A2-  Also i. q. دَلْوٌ [A bucket]: (K:)
[an arabicized word from the Pers. دُولْ: or]
formed from دَلْوٌ by transposition. (TA.)
دَوَلٌ, as an epithet applied to نَبْلٌ [or arrows]
i. q. ↓ مُتَدَاوَلٌ. (IAar, M, K. *) So in the saying,
يُلُوذُ بِالجَوْدِ مِنَ النَّبْلِ الدَّوَلْ
[app. relating to a wild animal, and meaning. He
seeks, or takes, refuge in the copious rain from the
arrows received in turns by one after another of
the herd]. (IAar, M.)
-A2-  See also دَوْلَةٌ.
دَالَةٌ i. q. شُهْرَةٌ [Notoriousness, &c.]: pl. [or
rather coll. gen. n.] ↓ دَالٌ. (IAar, T, K.) ―
-b2-
[Accord. to the K, it is also an inf. n.: see 1.]
دَوْلَةٌ A turn, mutation, change, or vicissitude,
of time, or fortune, (K, TA,) from an unfortunate and evil, to a good and happy, state or
condition; (TA;) [i. e.,] relating to good; as
دَبْرَةٌ, on the contrary, relates to evil: (As, T and
M in art. دبر:) [therefore meaning a turn of good
fortune; a favourable turn of fortune: or] good
fortune [absolutely]: (KL:) a happy state or
condition, that betides a man: (MF:) [also] a
turn which comes to one or which one takes [in
an absolute sense]; syn. نَوْبَةٌ: (K in art. نوب:)
and [particularly] (K) a turn (عُقْبَةٌ) [to share]
in wealth, and [to prevail] in war; as also ↓ دُولَةٌ:
('Eesà Ibn-'Omar, * T, * S, * M, K: *) or each is
a subst. [in an absolute sense, app. as meaning a
turn of taking, or having, a thing,] from تَدَاوَلُوا
الشَّىْءَ signifying “ they took, or had, the thing by
turns: ” (Msb:) or ↓ دُولَةٌ is in wealth; and دَوْلَةٌ
is in war; (Aboo-'Amr Ibn-El-'Alà, T, S, M,
Msb, K;) this latter being when one of two
armies defeats the other and then is defeated;
(Fr, T;) or when one party is given a turn to
prevail (تُدَال) over the other: one says, كَانَتْ
لَنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الدَّوْلَةُ فِى الحَرْبِ [The turn to prevail
over them in war was ours]: (S:) and قَدْ رَجَعَتِ
الدَّوْلَةُ عَلَى هٰؤُلَآءِ [The turn to prevail against
these returned]; as though meaning المَرَّةُ: so
says Fr: but ↓ دُولَةٌ, he says, is in religions and
institutions that are altered and changed with
time: (T:) accord. to Zj, (T,) or A'Obeyd, (so
in two copies of the S,) ↓ دُولَةٌ signifies a thing
that is taken by turns; and دَوْلَةٌ, the act [of
taking by turns]; (T, S;) and a transition from
one state, or condition, to another: (T: [in this
last sense, app. an inf. n.: see 1, third sentence:])
you say, بَيْنَهُمْ ↓ صَارَ الفَىْءُ دُولَةً, meaning [The فىء
(or spoil, &c.,) became] a thing taken by turns
among them: (S:) and the saying, in the
Kur [lix. 7], بَيْنَ الأَغْنِيَآءِ مِنْكُمْ ↓ كَىْ لَا يَكُونَ دُولَةً
means That it may not be a thing taken by turns
[among the rich of you]: (T:) or دَوْلَةٌ relates to
the present life or world; and ↓ دُولَةٌ, to that
which is to come: (M, K:) and it is said that
the former of these two words signifies prevalence, predominance, mastery, or victory; and
↓ the latter, the transition of wealth, blessing, or
good, from one people, or party, to another:
(TA:) the pl. (of دَوْلَةٌ, S, Msb) is دَوِلٌ, (S, M,
Msb, K,) like as قِصَعٌ is pl. of قَصْعَةٌ, (Msb,) and
(of ↓ دُولَةٌ, T, S, Msb), دُوَلٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K)
and دُولَاتٌ, (S, TA,) and ↓ دَوَلٌ (M, K) is [a
quasi-pl. n.] of both, because, as IJ says, دَوْلَةٌ is
regarded as though it were originally دُولَةٌ. (M.)
―
-b2-  [In post-classical works, it signifies also A
dynasty: and a state, an empire, or a monarchy.]
-A2-  Also The حَوْصَلَة [or stomach of a bird; its
triple stomach: or only its first stomach; the
crop, or craw]: because of its اِنْدِيَال [or flaccidity]. (Ibn-'Abbaád, K.) And The قَانِصَة
[which may here mean the same as the حوصلة,
for this is one of the meanings assigned to it, and
this explanation of دولة is not given by Ibn-
'Abbád: or it may here mean the intestines, of a
bird, into which the food passes from the stomach:
or the gizzard]. (K.) ―
-b2-  And The شِقْشِقَة [or
faucial bag of the he-camel]. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
―
-b3-  And A thing like a مَزَادَة [or leathern water-bag] with a narrow mouth. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
―
-b4-  And The side of the belly. (K.) [But]
accord. to Ibn-'Abbád, مَا أَعْظَمَ دَوْلَةَ بَطْنِهِ means
How large is his navel! (TA.)
دوُلَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in nine
places: ―
-b2-  and see also what next follows, in
two places.
دُوَلَةٌ (T, S, K) and ↓ دِوَلَةٌ (Ibn-'Abbád, TA)
[and ↓ دُولَةٌ, as appears from what follows]; as
also تُوَلَةٌ (T, S) [and تِوَلَةٌ and تُوَلةٌ]; A calamity,
or misfortune: (T, Ibn-'Abbád, S, K:) pl. دُوَلَاتٌ
(S) and دِوَلَاتٌ and دُوَلَاتٌ. (Ibn-'Abbád, TA.)
You say, جَآءَ بِدُوَلَاتِهِ (S) [and ↓ بِدِوَلَاتِهِ] and
↓ بِدُولَاتِهِ (Ibn-'Abbad, TA) and ↓ بِدُولَاهُ, as also

or brought, or brought to pass, his, or its, calamities, or misfortunes: (Ibn-'Abbád, S, K. *)
دِوَلَةٌ: and جَآءَبِدَوَلَاتِهِ: see دُوَلَةٌ.
جَآءَ بِدُولَاهُ: see دُوَلَةٌ.
دَوِيلٌ A plant that is a year old, (S, M, K,)
and dry: (M, K:) or two years old, (AZ, K,)

dry of the [plants called] نَصِىّ and سَبَط: (M, K, *
TA:) or any plant broken and black. (TA.)
دَوَالِىُّ A sort of grapes of Et-Táïf, (M, K,)
black inclining to redness. (M.) [See also دَوَالٍ,
in art. دلو.]
دَوَالَيْكَ i. q. مُدَاوَلَةً, [in the CK, erroneously,
مُتَداوَلَةً,] used in an imperative sense [with its
verb and the objective complement thereof understood before it, and thus meaning دَاوِلِ الفِعْلَ
مُدَاوَلَةً Make thou the action to come round, or
to be, by turns]: (M, K:) or it may be rendered
as meaning that the thing happened in this
manner [i. e. the action being made to come
round, or to be, by turns]: (Sb, M:) or it means
تَدَاوُلٌ بَعْدَ تَدَاوُل [i. e. a taking, or doing, (a
thing) by turn after (another's) doing so, and
may be rendered virtually in the same manner as
above, i. e. let the action be done by turns: or
the action being done by turns]: (S, O, K: [in
the PS, تَدَاوُلًا بَعْدَ تَدَاوُلٍ, which better explains
the two manners in which it is said to be used:])
IAar says that it is an invariable expression, like
حَجَازَيْكَ and هَذَاذَيْكَ; and is from the phrase
تَدَاوَلُوا الأَمْرَ بَيْنَهُمْ, said of persons when this takes
a turn and this a turn. (T, TA.) 'Abd-Beni-l-
Has-hás says,
إِذَ شُقَّ بُرْدٌ شُقَّ بِالبُرْدِ مِثْلُهُ
دَوَالَيْكَ حَتَّى لَيْسَ لِلْبُرْدِ لَابِسُ
[When a burd (a kind of garment) is rent, the
like thereof is rent with the burd, the action being
done by turns, so that there is no wearer of the
burd; it having been rent so as to fall off]:
(S:) the poet is speaking of a man's rending
the clothing of a woman to see her person, and
her rending his also. (T, TA. [This verse is
related with several variations: see another reading of it voce هَذَاذَيْكَ, in art. هذ; with another
explanation of it.]) ―
-b2-  Ibn-Buzurj says, (T,)
sometimes the article ال is prefixed to it, so that
one says الدَّوَالَيْكَ, (T,) meaning One's walking
with an elegant and a proud and self-conceited
gait, with an affected inclining of the body from
side to side, (T,) or one's urging, or pressing
forward, and striving, (أَنْ يَتَحَفَّزَ, [in the CK,
erroneously, ان يَتَحَفَّزَ,]) in his gait, or pace,
(K,) when he moves about his shoulder-joints, and
parts his legs widely, in walking. (T, K,* TA.
In the copies of the K, جال [or جاءك] is erroneously put for حَاكَ, the reading in the T, TA.
[The author of the TK follows the reading
جال; and has fallen into several other evident
mistakes in explaining this expression; which is
itself, in my opinion, when with the article ال, a
mistake for الدَّوَالِيْكُ, mentioned in art. دلك.])
A poet uses the phrase يَمْشِى الدَّوَالَيْكَ as meaning Walking, or going, in the manner explained
above: (Ibn-Buzurj, T and TA in the present
art.:) or يَمْشِى الدَّوَالِيكَ. (TA in art. دلك.)
مُنْدَالٌ as meaning Dangling, or moving to and
fro; and hanging; is said by Seer to be of the
measure مُنْفَعِلٌ from التَّدَلَّى, and formed by
transposition; and if so, it has no inf. n.; for the
word that is formed by transposition has no inf. n.
(M. [But for this assertion I see no satisfactory
reason.])
مُتَدَوَالٌ: see دَوَلٌ. ―
-b2-  [الكَلَامُ المُتَدَاوَلُ signifies,
in modern Arabic, The language commonly used.]
