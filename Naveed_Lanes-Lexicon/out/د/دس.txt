دس1
دَسَّهُ, (S, M, A, &c.,) aor.
دَسُ3َ, (M, Msb,)
inf. n. دَسٌّ (M, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and دَسِّيسَى,
(K,) like خِصِّيصَى, (TA,) He hid it, or concealed it, (Lth, S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) namely, anything, (A, Mgh, Msb,) in the earth or dust, (S,
Mgh,) or beneath a thing: (A, Mgh:) he buried
it (A, Msb, K) in the earth or dust, (Msb,) or
beneath a thing: (K:) or he put it in, or inserted it, beneath: (M:) or, accord. to some, he
put it in, or inserted it, with force; he thrust it in:
(TA:) and ↓ دَسَّسَهُ and ↓ دَسَّاهُ, (M, K, *) in the
latter of which one of the س is changed
into ى because the reduplication is disliked, (M, *
TA,) signify the same as دَسَّهُ, (M, K, *) [or,
probably, have an intensive signification.] It is
said in the Kur [xvi. 61], أَمْ يَدُسُّهُ التُّرَابِ
Or whether he shall bury it in the dust: meaning,
his female child, which he buried alive: the
pronoun agreeing with the word ما [which precedes in the same verse]. (T, TA.) It is also said
in the Kur [xci. 9 and 10], قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَنْ زَكَّاهَا وَقَدْ
↓ خَابَ مَنْ دَسَّاهَا, (M, K, *) in which دسّاها is for
↓ دَسَّسَهَا, like تَظَنَّيْتُ for تَظَنَّنْتُ, (K,) because the
niggardly conceals his place of sojourning and
his property, but the liberal makes his place of
sojourning upon an open and elevated spot that
he may not be concealed from guests and those
who desire to come to him: (Fr, Zj, K: *) or the
meaning is, He is successful who maketh it
(namely his soul) pure and believing, and he is
unsuccessful who introduceth it among the good
when he is not of them: (IAar, Th, M, K: *) or
[he is successful who maketh it to increase in
grace by good works,] and he is unsuccessful who
maketh it vile and little by evil works: (M:) or
the latter clause means, and he is unsuccessful
who hideth it, and maketh it obscure and of no
reputation, by the neglect of almsgiving and of
obedience [to God in other matters]: (TA:) or
the soul is unsuccessful that God rendereth obscure [so I render, here, دسّاها]. (Fr, K.)
-A2-
دَسَّ البَعِيرَ, aor.
دَسُ3َ, inf. n. دَسٌّ, He anointed the
camel with tar, not thoroughly, [but only in the
arm-pits, and the inner parts of the roots of the
thighs or other similar parts:] (M:) [for it is
said that] دُسَّ البَعِيرُ signifies the camel was
anointed with tar in the parts called the مَسَاعِر:
(S: [see دَجَلَ:]) or the latter signifies the camel
became swollen in the parts so called. (M.)
Hence the prov., لَيْسَ الهَنْءُ بِالدَّسِّ [which see
explained in art. هنأ]. (TA in art. هنأ. [In the
S and M and TA, in the present art., instead of
الهَنْءُ, we find الهِنَآءُ: but the former is the preferable reading.])

called by the vulgar ↓ دَاسُوسٌ: (TA:) or دَسِيسُ

note in my copy of the TA: see عِرْقٌ]. (TA.)
