radical letter sometimes ن and sometimes an
infirm letter and sometimes elided, to لَدُنْ and

third like يَدٌ, (T, TA,) and by some written دَدٌّ,
with teshdeed; (TA; [but it is there implied
that this is of doubtful authority;]) and the second
and third said by some to be formed from the
first, by the change of ن into ا and by the elision
of ن; (TA;) Diversion, sport, play, or such as
is vain, or frivolous; (T, S, K;) as also دَيْدٌ,

sword with which trees are cut; called by others
مِعْضَدٌ; and this is not necessarily the contr. of a
blunt sword. (TA.) ―
