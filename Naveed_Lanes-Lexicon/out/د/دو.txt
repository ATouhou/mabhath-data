دو2
دوّى He took his way in the دَوّ [q. v.].
(M, K.) And دوّى فِىالأَرْضِ He went away
into the country, or in the land. (T.) Ru-beh
uses the phrase دوّى بِهَا as signifying He passed
by them; meaning, by them, a male [wild] ass
and his she-asses. (T.) And it is said of the
دَوِّيَّة that it is thus called لِأَنَّهَا تُدَوِّى صَارَ فِيهَا,
i. e. Because it makes away with those who are in
it. (T.)
-A2-  See also art. دوى.
دَوٌّ and ↓دَوِّيَّةٌ (T, S, M, K, the latter [erroneously] written in the CK دَوِيَّة) A desert, or
waterless desert; syn.مَفَازَةٌ, (S, M,) or فَلَاةٌ; (K;)
as also ↓ دَوِّىٌّ (S) and ↓ دَاوِيِّةٌ, (S, M, K,) in
which the first و which is quiescent, [in دَوِّيِّةٌ, for
دَوْوِيَّةٌ,] is changed into ا because of the fet-hah
before it, though this instance is not to be copied
as a model, (S,) and ↓دَاوِيَةٌ: (M, K:) or دَوٌّ
signifies a wide فَلَاة: (M:) or a level land; likened
by Dhu-r-Rummeh to the hand of the purchaser,
meaning when he strikes his hand upon that of
another in token of the ratification of a bargain:
and ↓دَوِّيَّةٌ, a land of which the extremities are
far apart, level, and spacious; said to be so
called because of the sound termed دَوِىّ that is
heard in it; [and if so, these two words (the
latter of which is also mentioned in art. دوى)
belong to one and the same art.;] or because it
makes away with those who are in it; [see 2,
above;] and ↓دَاوِيَّةٌ and ↓دَاوِيَةٌ signify the same:
(T:) it is also said that دَوٌّ is [in origin] a Pers.
word; as though he who traversed the دَوّ said to
his companion دَوْدَوْ, meaning “ Hasten: ”
(TA:) or, as some say, a certain region, four
nights' journey in extent, like a shield, vacant,
traversed by means of the stars, in which one
feared losing his way, on the way from El-Basrah
to Mekkeh, was named الدَّوُّ for this reason, from
the Persians' hastening one another while crossing
it by saying دَوْدَوْ. (T.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] بَنَاتُ الدَّوِّ
(assumed tropical:)  The wild asses. (T in art. بنى.)
دَوِّىٌّ [a rel. n. from دَوٌّ;] One inhabiting a دَوّ.
(S.) [Hence the saying,] مَا بِهَا دَوِّىٌّ, (S, K, TA,
[in the CK, erroneously, دَوِىٌّ,]) and ↓, دُوِّىٌّ (Sgh,
K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously, دُوِىٌّ,]) and
↓دُوْوِىٌّ, as in the M, or ↓دَوَوِىٌّ, as in the K,
(TA,) i. e. [There is not in it (meaning بِالدَّارِ in
the house)] any one (S, M, K) of those who
inhabit the دَوّ: like as one says مَا بِهَا طُورِىٌّ, and
دُورِىٌّ. (S.) ―
-b2-  See دَوٌّ, with which it is also
syn. (S.)
