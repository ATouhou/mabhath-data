the second paragraph of art. ضمر and the first of

woman, or female slave, is treated in order that
she may become fat: and also applied to milk;
because they used to effect the تضمير of horses by
the drinking of milk, and to treat therewith the
young woman, or female slave: and it is likewise
called قَفِيَّةٌ; because she has it given to her in
preference, like as the guest has, and the child.
