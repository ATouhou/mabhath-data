دأR. Q. 1
دَأْدَأَ, inf. n. دَأْدَأَةٌ and دِئْدَآءٌ, He (a
camel, S) ran (عَدَا) most vehemently, (S, M, K,
TA,) going a pace quicker than that termed عَنَقٌ
[q. v.]: (TA:) or hastened, or sped, and ran, or
rose in his running; syn. أَسْرَعَ وَ أَحْضَرَ: (K:)
accord. to AA, ↓ دَأْدَآءٌ is [a subst., or quasiinf. n., signifying] a quick pace or manner of
going: and [the inf. n.] دَأْدَأَةٌ is syn. with إِحْضَارٌ:
and in the Nawádir [app. of Aboo-'Amr EshSheybánee] it is said that دَوْدَأَ (inf. n. دَوْدَأَةٌ) and
تَوْدَأَ (inf. n. تَوْدَأَةٌ) and كَوْدَأَ (inf. n. كَوْدَأَةٌ) are
syn. with عَدَا; and that دَأْدَأَةٌ and دِئْدَآءٌ signify a
camel's proceeding with short steps, at a rate
quicker than that of the pace termed حَفَدٌ [q. v.]:
accord. to the Kf, these two words signify the
going a pace quicker than that termed خَبَبٌ
[q. v.], not so quick as that termed رَبَعَةٌ [q. v.].
(TA.) You say, دَأْدَأَتِ الدَّابَّةُ The beast ran a
pace quicker than that termed عَنَقٌ. (M.) And
دَأْدَأَ فِى إِثْرِهِ He followed him, having him near
before him. (M, * K, * TA.) And hence, دَأْدَأَ مِنْهُ
He ran (أَحْضَرَ) to escape from him, being followed by him, and being near before him; as
also ↓ تَدَأْدَأَ. (M.)

here app. relating to any month]: (TA:) or
↓ دَأْدَأٌ signifies the day, (M,) or night, (TA,)

poetic license, دَآدٍ: (M:) or the دَآدِئ are three
nights of the latter part of the month, before
those called ليالى المحاق: (T, S:) thus says
A 'Obeyd; and IAar says the like: or they are
the three nights that are after the محاق; and
are so called because the moon hastens therein to
become invisible; from the phrase دَأْدَأَةُ البَعِيرِ:
As says that three of the nights of the month are
called the محاق; and three, the دآدئ; and
these latter are the last; and AHeyth says the
like. (T.) ↓ الدِّئْدَآءُ signifies also The last part
of the night. (Kr, M.) And ↓ لَيْلَةٌ دَأْدَأٌ and
↓ دَأْدَأَةٌ and دَأْدَآءٌ and ↓ دَأْدَآءَةٌ, (M, K, TA,) of
which the first two are the most common, mean
A dark night: (TA:) or a very dark night:
(M, K:) because of the concealment of the moon
therein. (TA.)
