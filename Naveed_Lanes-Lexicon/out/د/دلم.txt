this signification to ادلّم as on the authority of
the S.]) And اللَّيْلُ ↓ اِدْلَأَمَّ [so in the TA and in
my MS. copy of the K, but in the CK ↓ ادْلامَّ,]

signifies, (TA,) or thus ↓ دُلَمٌ, (so in the T
accord. to the TT,) the young one of a serpent:
and the pl. is أَدْلَامٌ. (T, TA.) Hence the prov.,
هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنَ الدَّلَمِ [He is more distressing than
the دلم]: (K:) and one says also, هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنَ
الدَّلَمِ فِى الشَّفَةِ, meaning [He is more distressing] than flaccidity and pendulousness in the
lip. (This, as well as the former saying, being

as some say, (M,) a place where ants and ticks
collect, at the places where the camels stand when
they come to drink at the watering-troughs, and
where they lie down at the watering-places: (S,
M, K:) [or] ants [themselves]; (T, TA;) and
ticks; both said by Z to be so called because
they are enemies to the camels [from a signification of the same word to be mentioned below]:
(TA:) or numerous ants. (Har p. 586.) ―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  An
army; likened to ants in respect of its numerousness: (TA:) or a numerous army. (T.) ―

are a certain people, (T, S, M, K,) well known;
(M, K;) [inhabitants of a mountainous tract, a
part of the ancient Media, on the south of the
Caspian Sea;] called by Kr the تُرْك [or Turks];
(M;) but accord. to the opinion commonly held
by the genealogists, (TA,) they are said to be of
the descendants of Dabbeh Ibn-Udd, whom some
of the kings of the 'Ajam [or Persians] placed
in those mountains [which their posterity inhabit], and who there multiplied: (T, TA:) or
الدَّيْلَمُ is a surname of the Benoo-Dabbeh, (S, *
K,) because of their blackness, (K,) or because
they, or the generality of them, are دُلْم [pl. of
أَدْلَمُ]. (S.) ―
-b7-  [Hence, perhaps,] دَيْلَمٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A calamity, or misfortune. (S, K.)

manner applied to a mountain, but as meaning,

serpent. (T.) ―

وَلَقَدْ هَمَمْتُ بِغَارَةٍ فِى لَيْلَةٍ
سَوْدَآءَ حَالِكَةٍ كَلَوْنِ الأَدْلَمِ
[And verily I purposed a hostile incursion in a
night intensely black, like the colour of black
leather]. (T.) ―
-b4-  [Hence,] by way of comparison,
one says لَيْلٌ أَدْلَمُ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  Black, or intensely
dark, night]. (TA.) ―
-b5-  الدَّلْمَآءُ [fem. of الأَدْلَمُ]
