دن1
دَنَّ: see R. Q. 1, in four places.
-A2-  [دَنِنَ is
mentioned by Golius and Freytag (by the
former as from the S) as though it were the verb
of which دَنَنٌ (q. v.) is the inf. n.; but I find no
authority for it: and if دَنَنٌ have a verb, it
should, accord. to rule, be دَنَّ, aor. يَدَنُّ.]

دَنَّ3َ see R. Q. 1.
4
ادنّ, (T, K,) inf. n. إِدْنَانٌ, (T, TA,) He
(a man, T, TA) remained, stayed, abode, or dwelt,
(T, K, TA,) [as though set in the ground like a
دَنّ,] بَالمَكَانِ in the place; like أَبَنَّ: (T, TA:)
on the authority of Aboo-Turáb, (T,) or Ibn-ElFaraj. (TA.)
R. Q. 1
دَنْدَنَ It buzzed, or made a buzzing
sound; syn. صَوَّتَ, and طَنَّ, (K,) and طَنْطَنَ;
(Sh, T, TA;) as also ↓ دَنَّ, and ↓ دنّن; said of
the fly, (K,) [and of the bee, and of the hornet,
and the like; for] دَنْدَنَةٌ [inf. n. of دَنْدَنَ] (Lth,
T, M, K) and دَنِينٌ [inf. n. of ↓ دَنَّ] (Lth, T,
M) and ↓ دِنْدِنٌ [a simple subst.] (M) signify
the buzzing (صَوْت, Lth, T, M, K) of the fly,
(M, K,) or the bee, (Lth, T,) and the hornet,
(Lth, T, M, K,) and the like. (M.) ―
-b2-  And
[hence,] He (a man) spoke in a low, gentle, or
soft, tone, so that his speech was not understood;
(A'Obeyd, K, TA;) [as also ↓ دَنَّ; for] دَنْدَنَةٌ
[inf. n. of the former] (A'Obeyd, T, S, M, K)
and دَنِينٌ [inf. n. of ↓ دَنَّ] and ↓ دِنْدِنٌ (M, K)
signify the speaking in a low, gentle, or soft, tone,
(A'Obeyd, T, S,) or in the manner termed
هَيْنَمَةٌ, (M, K,) so that the speech is not understood:
(A'Obeyd, T, S, M:) or دَنْدَنَةٌ signifies [merely]
the speaking in a low, or faint, tone: (M:)
accord. to IAth, it is a little above what is termed
هَيْنَمَةٌ. (TA.) A poet says,
نُدَنْدِنُ مَثْلَ دَنْدَنَةِ الذُّبَابِ
[We buzz in our speech like the buzzing of the
fly]. (Sh, T.) And it is said in a trad., حَوْلَهَا
نُدَنْدِنُ, (S,) or حَوْلَهُمَا, (M, JM, TA,) which is
thus explained: the Prophet asked an Arab of the
desert, “What dost thou say in the تَشَهُّد? ” [see
this word, which means the repetition of a form
of words at the close of the ordinary prayers:]
and he answered, “I ask of God Paradise, and
seek protection of Him from the fire [of Hell]:
but as to thy دَنْدَنَة and the دَنْدَنَة of Mo'ádh, I
do not approve it: ” and the Prophet said,
حَوْلَهُمَا نُدَنْدِنُ; (M, JM; *) i. e. [We speak with
a low, or faint, voice] about those two things,
namely, the seeking Paradise and the praying for
protection from the fire [of Hell]; and on account
of them: (JM:) accord. to some, it is from
دَنْدَنَ حَوْلَ المَآءِ He went round about the water:
[hence it may mean we utter our prayer respecting
them with a low, or faint, sound, as though we
were buzzing round about them like flies; seeking
to enter the one, and to keep outside the other:]
As says that it may be from the signification of
the sound [of buzzing], or from that of going
round about: (TA:) or, accord. to one relation,
the Prophet said, عَنْهُمَا نُدَنْدِنُ [From a consideration of them we utter our prayer with a
low, or faint, voice;] i. e. our دَنْدَنَةُ arises from
them; and is because of them: and hence, (JM,)
دَنْدَنَ means also He (a man, JM) went to and
fro in one place. (JM, TA.)
دَنٌّ A wine-jar: (MA:) a [jar of the kind
called] حُبّ: (S:) or [a jar] in form like a حُبّ:
(Msb:) or a large رَاقُود [or earthen jar, smeared
inside with pitch, long in the lower part], (M,
K,) in form like the حُبّ, (M,) but taller; (M;
in the K, or taller than the حُبّ;) uniform in
make, [tapering to the bottom,] having at the
lower end what resembles the قَوْنَس [or tapering
top] of a helmet: (M:) or smaller than the
حُبّ, having a pointed lower extremity, [so I
render عُسْعُسٌ, (agreeably with the TK,) regarding it as a dial. var., or perhaps a mistranscription, of عُصْعُصٌ, which properly signifies the
“ os coccygis,”] (M, K,) so that (M) it will not
sit [upright] without one's digging a hole for it:
(M, K:) IDrd says that it is a genuine Arabic
word: (M:) pl. [of mult.] دِنَانٌ (T, S, M, Msb)
[and دِنَنَةٌ and (of pauc.) أَدْنُنٌ and أَدُنٌّ, as appears
from the following saying of IAar, quoted by Az:]
one says دَنٌّ and أَدْنُنٌ and أَدُنٌّ and دِنَانٌ and
دِنَنَةٌ. (T.) [See an ex. in a verse of El-Aashà
cited voce اِرْتِسَامٌ.]
دَنَنٌ A bending, or curving, in the back [so
that it resembles a دَنّ: see أَدَنُّ]: (M, K:) and
a nearness [to the ground] in the neck and breast,
(M, K,) and a stooping, (M,) and lowness,
therein, (M, K,) by original natural constitution:
it is in a man, (M,) and in a horse or the like,
and any quadruped: (M, K:) or shortness, and
lowness, or depression, of the neck: (R, TA:) or,
in a horse, shortness of the fore legs: or, accord.
to As, in any quadruped, nearness of the breast to
the ground; which is one of the worst of faults:
(S:) or, accord. to AZ, in a camel, a leaning
forward, with shortness of the fore legs: and,
accord. to AHeyth, in a horse or similar beast,
shortness of the fore legs, and a consequent nearness of the neck to the ground. (T.)
دِنَّةٌ A certain insect resembling an ant: (K:)
so called because of its shortness. (TA.)
دِنِّيَّةٌ The [kind of cap called] قَلَنْسُوَة, of a
Kádee; likened to a دَنّ; (K;) a قلنسوة worn by
Kádees, as though so called in relation to the
دَنّ, because high and round: (Har p. 109:)
accord. to Esh-Shereeshee, originally دَنِينَةٌ; a
قلنسوة pointed at the extremity, [in my original
الاطراف is erroneously put for الطَّرَف,] worn by
Kádees and great men: not a genuine Arabic
word, but of the dial. of El-'Irák. (TA.)
دِنْدِنٌ syn. with دَنْدَنَةٌ: see R. Q. 1, in two
places.
-A2-  Also Herbage (S, M, K) and trees,
(M, K,) or dry herbage, (As, T,) become black,
(As, T, S, K,) or wasted and black, (M,) by
reason of oldness: (As, T, S:) or what is broken
in pieces of [the species of barley-grass called]
بُهْمَى, when it has become black and old: or the
stems (أُصُول) of old and wasted trees: (M:)
accord. to Lth, the stems (اصول) of trees: but
the right explanation is that given above on the
authority of As. (T.)
دَنَادِنُ The ذَلَاذِل [or lower parts, that are next
the ground,] of garments. (K.)
أَدَنُّ One whose back resembles the دَنّ; (IAar,
T;) [i. e.] having a bending, or curving, in the
back; (S, M, K;) applied to a man; (S;)
hump-backed: (Fr, TA in art. عجر:) and having
the neck and breast near [to the ground], (M, K,)
and stooping, (M,) and low, (M, K,) by original
natural constitution: applied to a man, (M,) and
to a horse or the like, and any quadruped: (M,
K:) or, applied to a horse, short in the fore legs:
(S:) or, applied to a camel, leaning forward,
with shortness of the fore legs: (AZ, T:) or,
applied to a horse or the like, short in the fore
legs, and consequently having his neck near to the
ground: (AHeyth, T:) As said that no أَدَنّ ever
outstripped except that of the Benoo-Yarbooa:
(M:) fem. دَنَّآءُ. (M, K.) [See also دَنَنٌ.] ―
-b2-
Also, applied to a house, or chamber, or tent,
(بَيْت, [for which Golius appears to have read
نَبْت,]) Low, or depressed, [app. in its roof.]
(S, K.)
