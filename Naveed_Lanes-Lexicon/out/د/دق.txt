[i. e. it was, or became, thin as meaning slender,
or small in diameter or circumference as compared with length: also small in all dimensions;
small in size; minute, or fine, either as a whole,
or in its component particles: and sometimes, as
said of a garment or the like, thin, or fine, as
opposed to thick or coarse; like رَقَّ:] contr. of
غَلُظَ: (Msb:) ↓ استدقّ is said of the هِلَال [or
moon a little after or before the change], and of
other things. (TA.) [See also رِقَّةٌ.] ―
-b2-  And
[hence], aor. and inf. n. as above, (tropical:)  He, or it,
was, or became, little in estimation, paltry, inconsiderable, mean, vile, or contemptible. (TA.) One
says to him who refuses to confer a benefit, دَقَّ بِكَ
خُلُقُكَ (assumed tropical:)  [Thy nature, or natural disposition,
hath rendered thee mean, &c.; the verb being
made trans. by بِ, agreeably with a common

affair, or a case, [and of speech, or language,] (assumed tropical:)  It
was, or became, subtile, nice, abstruse, recondite,
or obscure. (Msb.) And you say, دَقَّ فِى كَلَامِهِ
(tropical:)  [He was, or became, subtile, nice, abstruse, &c.,

―
-b2-  [And hence, He beat it; namely, a garment
or the like; in washing and whitening it. And
دَقَّ البَابَ He knocked at the door for admission.]
―
-b3-  And [hence also, (in the CK, erroneously,
“ or,”) as appears from what follows,] (assumed tropical:)  He made
it apparent; showed, exhibited, manifested, or
revealed, it: (K:) so says IAar, citing the
following verse of Zuheyr:
تَدَارَكْتُمَا عَبْسًا وَذُبْيَانَ بَعْدَمَا
تَفَانَوْا وَدَقُّوا بَيْنَهُمْ عِطْرَ مَنْشِمِ
(TA:) i. e. Ye two repaired the condition of the
tribes of 'Abs and Dhubyán by peace, (تَلَافَيْتُمَا
أَمْرَهُمَا بِالصُّلْحِ,) after they had shared, one with
another, in destruction, and had brayed [among
themselves] the perfume of Menshim as a sign
of their having leagued together against their
enemy; i. e., after slaughter had come upon the
last of their men, as upon the last of those who
perfumed themselves with the perfume of Menshim: for [it is said that] منشم is the name of
a woman who sold perfume in Mekkeh, and
a party bought of her some perfume, and leagued
together to fight their enemy, making the dipping of their hands in that perfume to be a sign
of their league; and they fought until they were
slain to the last of them: whence the prov.,
أَشْأَمُ مِنْ عِطْرِ مَنْشِمَ: (EM p. 117:) [so that,
accord. to this explanation, which is one of many,
منشم is made perfectly decl. for the sake of the
rhyme:] or the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  after they had
manifested enmities and faults. (TA.) One says
also, in cases of enmity, لَأَدُقَّنَّ شُعُورَكَ, meaning
(assumed tropical:)  I will assuredly manifest thy circumstances.

primary signification. (TA.) ―

(TK:) it signifies an act between two. (TA.) [And
داقّهُ فِى الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  He was minute, &c., with him
in the affair, or case.] المُدَاقَّةُ فِى الأَمْرِ signifies

other. (TK.) You say also, داقّ النَّظَرَ فِى مُعَامَلَاتِهِ
وَنَفَقَاتِهِ [He examined minutely into his dealings
and his expenses]. (TA in art. دنق.) ―

him a small thing: (S, TA:) or he gave him
little: (S in art. جل:) or (tropical:)  he gave him a sheep,

gave he me a great thing: (S in the present art.:)
or he gave me not little, nor gave he me much:
(S in art. جل:) or he gave me not a sheep, or
goat, nor gave he me a camel. (M.) ―
-b3-  And

people of Mekkeh: (IDrd, Sgh:) and salt with
such seeds mixed therewith: (M, K:) this is the
application now commonly obtaining: (TA:)
or salt alone: (M:) or salt bruised, or brayed:

but properly,] دَقِيقٌ differs from رَقِيقٌ; the former
signifying the contr. of غَلِيظٌ [as stated above],
