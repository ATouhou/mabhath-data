دون1
دَانَ, aor. يَدُونُ, inf. n. دَوْنٌ; and ↓ أُدِينَ,
(S, K,) with damm, (K,) inf. n. إِدَانَةٌ; (S;) He,
or it, was, or became, such as is termed دُونٌ;
(S, K;) [i. e.] low, base, vile, &c.: or weak:
(K:) mentioned by Er-Rághib on the authority
of IKt: (TA:) so say some: but accord. to
others, دُونٌ has no verb. (S, TA.) لَمْ يَدُنْ, (as
in my copies of the S,) or لم يُدَنْ, (as in the
TA,) at the end of a verse of 'Adee, as some
relate it, [perhaps the only authority for these
two verbs,] is accord. to others لم يدَنّْ, from دَنَّى
meaning “ he, or it, was, or became, weak. ”
(S, K.)
2
دوّن الدَّيوَانَ, (inf. n. تَدْوِينٌ, TA,) He
wrote, composed, or drew up, the register [&c.].
(S, * Msb, K, TA. *) And دوّن الدَّوَاوِينَ He
instituted, appointed, or arranged, the registers
for the prefects, or administrators, (Mgh, Msb,)
and the Kádees, (Mgh,) or others: (Msb:) said
of 'Omar; who is related to have been the first
that did this, (Mgh, Msb,) among the Arabs.
(Msb.) And دوّن الكُتُبَ He collected the writings.
(Mgh.) [And دوّن شِعْرَ فُلَانٍ He collected the
poetry of such a one.] And تَدْوِينٌ signifies also
The writing [a person's name &c.] in a دِيوَان
[or register]. (KL.) You say, دوّنهُ He wrote it
[in a register]. (MA.) [And He registered
him.]
4
أُدِينَ, inf. n. إِدَانَةٌ: see 1.
-A2-  مَا أَدْوَنَهُ [as
meaning How low, base, vile, &c., is he, or it!]
is [asserted to be] a phrase not used, (As, T, K,
TA,) because [it is said that] دُونٌ has no verb.
(As, T, TA.)
5
تدوّن He was, or became, in a state of complete richness, wealth, or competence. (IAar, T,
K.) [See also تذوّن. Perhaps both are correct,
as dial. vars.]
دُونً Low, base, vile, mean, paltry, inconsiderable, or contemptible; (Fr, T, S, M, * Msb, K;)
applied to a man &c.: (T, Msb:) and inferior,
i. e. lower, baser, viler, &c., in grounds of pretension to respect or honour [or in any approvable
quality]: (Lth, T:) and such as falls short [of a
thing]; used in this sense as a prefixed noun:
(Ham p. 686:) [see below what is said of its
usage as a prefixed noun by Lth and by Sb: and
used as an epithet, scanty, or deficient; applied
to anything:] and of a middling sort; between
good and bad; applied to a man and to a commodity: (M:) and also high, or eminent, in rank
or condition; noble, or honourable: (T, K:) thus
it bears two contr. significations (K) [and significations intermediate between those two]. A
poet says,
إِذَا مَا عَلَا المَرْءُ رَامَ العَلَآء
وَيَقْتَعُ بِالدُّونِ مَنْ كَانَا دُونَا
[When the man is high in rank, or nobility, he
seeks highness: and he who is low is content with
that which is low]. (S.) Accord. to the most
common usage, (Msb,) or accord. to what is
asserted to be the most common usage, (Lh, M,)
one says رَجُلٌ مِنْ دُونٍ (T, M, Msb, K) and
شَىْءٌ مِنْ دُونٍ (M, Msb) A man who is [of a
kind that is] low, base, &c., and a thing that is
[of a kind that is] low, base, &c.: (Msb:) but
sometimes they said رَجُلٌ دُونٌ and شَىْءٌ دُونٌ,
without مِنْ; (M, Msb;) and ثَوْبٌ دُونٌ a bad
[or an inferior] garment, or piece of cloth: (M:)
or one should not say رَجُلٌ دُونٌ; (T, K;) for the
Arabs did not use this phrase. (T.) Accord. to
Lth, one says, هٰذَا دُونُ ذَاكَ [This is the inferior
of that], when meaning to denote by it low estimation, using the nom. case: (T:) [but this is
uncommon, if allowable:] Sb says that دُون is
not used in the nom. case as a prefixed noun: as
to the saying in the Kur [lxxii. 11, an instance
similar to which occurs also in vii. 167], مِنَّا
الصَّالِحُونَ وَ مِنَّا دُونَ ذٰلِكَ, the meaning is, وَ مِنَّا
قَوْمٌ دُونَ ذٰلِكَ [i. e. Of us are the righteous, and of
us are a party below that party in rank or estimation]; (M, TA;) or, as another says, دون is
here in the accus. case but in the place of a noun
in the nom. case because it is generally used as an
adv. n. (TA.) ―
-b2-  As an adv. n., دُون signifies
Below, contr. of فَوْق; (S, K;) as denoting a
falling short of the [right or approved] limit;
(S;) or denoting low, or mean, estimation or
condition; (Lth, T, M;) or a condition lower,
baser, viler, &c., than that of another, in grounds
of pretension to respect or honour [or in any
approvable quality]; (Lth, T;) [and hence, inferior to, beneath, under, or short of, another in
rank, height, size, &c.;] and less than another,
and more deficient than another: (Fr, T:) and
also above; i. q. فَوْق; (T, K;) in highness, or
eminence, of rank or condition, or in nobility;
(T;) [and hence, exceeding another, and more than
another:] thus bearing two contr. significations.
(K.) You say, زَيْدٌ دُونَكَ meaning Zeyd is [below
thee, or] in a condition lower, baser, viler, &c.,
than thine, in grounds of pretension to respect or
honour [&c.]: and when one says, “Verily such
a one is high, or eminent, in rank or condition,”
or “ is noble,” another replies, وَ دُونَ ذٰلِكَ meaning
And above that. (T.) ―
-b3-  Also Beneath, below in
situation, or under; syn. تَحْت. (T, TA.) Using
it in this sense, you say, دُوَن قَدَمِكَ خَدُّ عَدُوِّكَ
[May the cheek of thine enemy be beneath thy foot]:
(T, TA:) and جَلَسَ دُونَهُ [He sat below him].
(TA.) ―
-b4-  Also Before in respect of place, or in
front: and [the contr., namely,] behind, or beyond.
(T, M, K.) [You may say, using it in the former
sense, جَلَسَ دُونَهُ He sat before him, or in front
of him: (see Ham p. 86:) and, using it in the
latter sense,] you say, هٰذَا أَمِيرٌ عَلَى مَا دُونَ
جَيْحُونَ This [man] is governor, or prince, over
what is beyond [the river] Jeyhoon. (TA.) ―
-b5-
And i. q. قَبْل [generally signifying Before in
respect of time; but as some say, in respect of
place also, which may perhaps be here meant]:
(T:) and [the contr., namely,] i. q. بَعْد [generally meaning after in respect of time; but as
some say, in respect of place also, which may
perhaps be here meant]. (Fr, T, TA.) ―
-b6-  It
signifies also Nearer than another thing: (S,
Msb, K:) so in the phrase هٰذَا دُونَ ذٰلِكَ [This
is nearer than that]; (S Msb;) or هٰذَا دُونَهُ
[this is nearer than he, or it]. (K.) [Hence,]
one says also, اُدْنُ دُونَكَ meaning Draw thou
near in the space that is between me and thee:
(A Heyth, T:) [or approach thou nearer to me:]
or draw thou near [or nearer] to me. (IAar, T,
M, K.) And يَزِيدُ بَغُضُّ الطَّرْفَ دُونِى, a saying of
a poet, means Yezeed lowers the eye towards a
spot between me and him. (A Heyth, T.) [خَشَعَتْ
دُونَهُ الأَبْصَارُ, also, has a similar meaning: see 1 in
art. خشع. So, too, has the phrase, خَاوَتَ طَرْفَهُ
دُونِى: see 3 in art. خوت. And hence,] one
says, دُونَ النَّهْرِ جَمَاعَةٌ [In the way of, or to, the
river, or on this side of the river, or nearer than
the river, is a company of men; or] before thy
reaching the river [there is to be found, or encountered, a company of men]. (K.) And دُونَ قَتْلِ
الأَسَدِ أَهْوَالٌ [In the way of, or to, the slaying of
the lion, or] before thine attaining to the slaying
of the lion, terrors [are to be encountered]. (T,
TA.) [And دُونَهُ خَرْطُ القَتَادِ: see 1 in art. خرط.]
And حَالَ دُونَ الشَّىْءِ [It intervened as an obstacle
in the way to the thing; or] it prevented from
attaining the thing. (W p. 71.) [And لَيْسَ دُونَهُ
شَىْءٌ There is nothing intervening as an obstacle
in the way of, or to, him, or it.] And [hence,]
قُتِلَ دُونَ مَالِهِ, and نَفْسِهِ, and أَخِيهِ, and جَارِهِ, He
was slain in defence of his property, and of himself, and of his brother, and of his neighbour.
(Occurring in a trad. commencing with the words
الغَرِيقُ شَهِيدٌ, in the “ Jámi' es-Sagheer,” and thus
explained in the margin of a copy of that work.)
[And نَبَحَ دُونَهُ is a modern phrase meaning
(assumed tropical:)  He defended him as though by barking in the
way to him.] ―
-b7-  [Hence,] also i. q. عَلَى [as
meaning Against; denoting defence by means of
intervention: see an ex. in a verse cited voce
شَخْصٌ]. (Fr, T, TA.) ―
-b8-  And i. q. عِنْدَ [meaning At, near, nigh, by, or near by; with, or present with; &c.]. (Fr, T, Ibn-Es-Seed.) Accord.
to Ez-Zowzanee, it has this meaning in the saying
of Imra-el-Keys, [describing a horse,]
فَأَلْحَقَنَا بِالهَادِيَاتِ وَ دُونَهُ
جَوَاحِرُهَا فِى صَرَّةٍ لَمْ تُزَيَّلِ
(TA, but only the former hemistich is there given,)
i. e. And he made us to overtake the foremost of
the wild animals, while near to him were those
that lagged behind, in a herd, not dispersed.
(EM p. 48.) ―
-b9-  And i. q. غَيْر [as meaning Other
than, beside, or besides, exclusively of, or not as
used before a substantive or an adjective]. (K.)
Hence, in the Kur [xxi. 82], وَيَعْمَلُونَ عَمَلًا دُونَ
ذٰلِكَ [And who should do work other than, or
beside, that]. (Fr, TA.) And in the same [iv.
51 and 116], وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذٰلِكَ But He will
forgive what is other than that: or, as some say,
what is less than that. (Er-Rághib, TA.) And
so, it is said, in the trad., لَيْسَ فِيمَا دُونَ خَمْسِ أَوَاقٍ
صَدَقَةٌ [There is no poor-rate to be exacted in the
case of what is other than, or not, or, rather
less than, five ounces]. (K.) So, too, it is said
to mean in the trad., أَجَازَ الخُلْعَ دُونَ عِقَاصِ رَأْسِهَا
[He allowed the divorcing a wife for a gift, or
compensation, other than the عِقَاص (q. v.) of her
head: in the CK, in which الخَلْعُ is erroneously
put for الخُلْعَ, this is given as an ex. of ذُونَ in the
sense of سَوِى, which is syn. with غَيْر]: or the
meaning is, for anything, even for the عقاص of
her head. (K, TA.) ―
-b10-  It is also used (M, K,
TA) as a subst. (M, TA) with مِنْ prefixed to it,
[very often in this case, in the Kur and elsewhere,
as meaning غَيْر and sometimes in other senses
explained above,] and likewise with بِ (M, K,
TA,) though rarely. (K.) One says, هٰذَا دُونَكَ
and هٰذَا مِنْ دُونِكَ [This is below thee, or above
thee: &c.]. (M, TA.) And it is said in the Kur
[xxviii. 23], وَوَجَدَ مِنْ دُونِهِمُ امْرَأَتَيْنِ (M, TA)
And he found in a place below them two women:
(Bd:) or beside them, or exclusively of them.
(Jel.) One says also, هٰدَا لِىدُونَ لَكَ or مِنْ دُونِكَ
[meaning This belongs to me exclusively of thee];
i. e. thou hast no right nor share [with me] in
this. (Kull p. 186.) The phrase فِيهِمْ مَنْ لَيْسَ
بِدُونِهِ [app. as meaning Among whom was such
as was not below him in respect of knowledge of
poetry] is used by Akh in his book on rhymes.
(M, TA.) ―
-b11-  It also denotes a command, (T, K,)
and an incitement (Fr, T, S, K) to do a thing.
(S.) Using it in the former sense, you say,
دُونَكَ الدِّرْهَمَ, meaning Take thou the dirhem;
(T;) or دُونَكَ الشَّىْءَ and دُونَكَ بِالشَّىْءِ, meaning
Take thou the thing: (M:) and using it in the
latter sense, you say, دُونَكَهُ, (S, K, TA,) meaning
Keep thou, cleave thou, cling thou, or hold thou
fast, to him; and take care of him: (TA:) or
دُنَكَ زَيْدًا Keep thou, &c., to Zeyd, taking care
of him. (T.) Temeem [meaning a party of the
tribe so named] said to El-Hajjáj, when he had
slain, i. e. crucified, Sálih Ibn-' Abd-Er-Rahmán,
“ Permit us to bury Sálih: ” and he replied,
دُونَكُمُوهُ [Take ye him]. (S, TA.) ―
-b12-  And it also
denotes a threat. (T, K.) So in the sayings
دُوَكَ صِرَاعِى [Beware thou of wrestling with me]
and دُونَكَ فَتَمَرَّسْ بِى [Beware thou, and then set
thyself against me to do evil if thou canst]. (T,
TA.) ―
-b13-  It is said that no verb is derived from it:
(T, S, M, Msb:) but some assert that دَانَ and
أُدِينَ [mentioned in the first paragraph of this art.]
are derived from it. (S.) ―
-b14-  The dim. of دُونَ is
↓ دُوَيْنَ: (Ham p. 404:) and ↓ دُوَيْنَةَ occurs as a
dim. in a verse of a post-classical poet; but, [ISd
says,] of what word I know not, unless they said
↓ دُونَةَ [for دُونَ]. (M.)
دُونَةَ: see the next preceding sentence.
دُوَيْنَ: see the next preceding sentence.
دُوَيْنَةَ: see the next preceding sentence.
دَيْوَانٌ: see the next paragraph.
دِيوَانٌ, an arabicized word, (AO, M, Msb, &c.,)
from the Pers. [دِيوَانْ]; (AO, M, &c.;) [though
some hold it to be of Arabic origin:] J says,
(TA,) it is originally دِوَّانٌ, but ى is substituted
for one of the و s ; as is shown by its pl., (S, Msb,)
which is دَوَاوِينُ; (S, M, Msb, K;) for if the ى
were radical, they would say دَيَاوِينُ; (S;) but
accord. to IDrd and IJ, (IB, TA,) it has this
latter pl. also: (M, IB, K, TA:) Sb says that the
و in دِيوَانٌ, though after ى, is not changed into
ى, as it is in سَيِّدٌ, because the ى in the former
word is not inherent; that word being of the
measure فِعَّالٌ, from دَوَّنْتَ; (M;) [i. e.] it is from
دَوَّنَ الكُتُبَ meaning “ he collected the writings; ”
as is shown by their saying ↓ دُوَيْوِينٌ, (M,) which
is the dim.: (Msb:) ISk says that ديوان is with
kesr only [to the د]; (M;) but one says ↓ دَيْوَانٌ
also, (K,) which is mentioned by Ks, as postclassical, and by Sb; like بَيْطَارٌ: (M:) the meaning
is A دَفْتَر [or register]: (Shifá el-Ghaleel, TA:)
or a collection of written leaves or papers [forming
a book, generally for registration]: (ISk, M,
Mgh, * K:) or a register of accounts; an accountbook: (Msb:) and a register of soldiers and
pensioners [and others]: (IAth, K:) the first who
instituted, or appointed, or arranged, such a book,
(Mgh, Msb, K,) among the Arabs, (Msb,) for the
prefects, or administrators, (Mgh, Msb,) and the
Kádees, (Mgh,) is said to have been 'Omar:
(Mgh, Msb, K: *) accord. to El-Máwardee, it is
a register of what concerns the rights, or dues, of
the state, relating to the acts of the government,
and the finances, and the military and other
administrators thereof: (TA:) then any book
was thus called: and especially the poetry of some
particular poet: so that this meaning became
[conventionally regarded as] a proper signification
thereof; (Shifá el-Ghaleel, TA;) i. e. a collection
of poetry [of a particular poet]. (TA.) [Hence,]
one says, فُلَانٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ الدِّيوَانِ, meaning Such a
one is of those whose names are written in the
register. (Mgh.) [Also Such a one is of the
keepers of the register; or, is of the registrars.
(And sometimes it has another meaning, which
see below.) And hence the saying] الشِّعْرُ دِيوَانُ
العَرَبِ (assumed tropical:)  [Poetry is the register of the Arabs]:
because they used to refer to it on their differing
in opinion respecting genealogies and wars or
fights and the appointing of stipends or allowances
from the government-treasury, like as the people
of the ديوان [properly so called] refer to their
ديوان in a case that is doubtful to them; or
because it was the depository of their sciences,
and the preserver of their rules of discipline, and
the mine of their histories. (Har p. 263.) ―
-b2-
Afterwards, also, it was applied to signify An
account, or a reckoning. (Msb, TA.) ―
-b3-  And
Writers [of accounts or reckonings]. (TA.) ―
-b4-
And A place of account or reckoning, (Msb,
TA,) and of writers [of accounts or reckonings]
(TA.) ―
-b5-  [Also A council, court, or tribunal:
see دَسْتٌ. Hence أَهْلُ الدِّيوَانِ sometimes means
The people of the council, court, or tribunal.
―
-b6-  And also, in the present day, A long seat,
formed of a mattress laid against the side of a
room, upon the floor or upon a raised structure
or frame, with cushions to lean against; or two
or more of such mattresses &c. similarly placed.]
ديوَانِىٌّ Of, or belonging to, a دِيوَان. (TA.)
دُوَيْوِينٌ dim. of دِيوَانٌ, q. v. (M, * Msb.)
أَدْوَنُ is used by IJ in the phrase ذٰلِكَ أَقَلٌّ
الأَمْرَيْنِ وَأَدْوَنُهُمَا [That is the lesser of the two
affairs, or cases, and the lower, baser, &c., of
them]: but [ISd says that] this is strange, because
[he held that], like أَحْنَكَ, it has no verb belonging to it. (M.)
