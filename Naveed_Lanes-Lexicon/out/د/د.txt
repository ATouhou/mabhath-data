دalphabetical letter
د
The eighth letter of the alphabet: called دَالٌ. It
is one of the letters termed مَجْهُورَة [or vocal, i. e.
pronounced with the voice, not with the breath
only]; and of the letters termed نِطَعِيَّة [pronounced by pressing the tip of the tongue against
the upper gums and suddenly withdrawing it],
like ط and ت. (TA.) It is substituted, agreeably with general usage, for the ت of the form
اِفْتَعَلَ and its variations, when the first radical
letter is ز, as in اِزْدَادَ [for اِزْتَادَ]; or ذ, as in اِدَّكَرَ
[for اِذْدَكَرَ, originally اِذْتَكَرَ]; or د, as in اِدَّرَأَ
[for اِدْدَرَأَ, originally اِدْتَرَأَ]: and sometimes after
ج, as in اِجْدَمَعُوا, a dial. var. of اِجْتَمَعُوا: also,
sometimes, for the pronominal affix ت after د,
as in جَلَدُّ for جَلَدْتُ; and after ز, as in جُزْدُ for
جُزْتُ: it is also substituted for the ت of تَوْلَجٌ,
contr. to analogy: and it occurs substituted for
ط, contr. to general usage, as in مَرَدَى for مَرَطَى.
(MF.)
-A2-  [As a numeral, it denotes Four.]
