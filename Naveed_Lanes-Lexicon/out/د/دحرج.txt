دحرجQ. 1
دَحْرَجَ, inf. n. دَحْرَجَةٌ and دِحْرَاجٌ, (S, L,
K,) [He rolled a thing along: and] he rolled a
thing down. (L, K.) ―
-b2-  [And He rounded a thing;
made it round: see the pass. part. n., below.]
Q. 2
تَدَحْرَجَ quasi-pass. of Q. 1; (S, L, K;)
[It (a thing) rolled along: and] it rolled down.
(L, K.) ―
-b2-  [And It became round.]
دُحْرُوجَةٌ The little ball [of dung] that is rolled
along by the جُعَل [or species of black beetle
called cantharus, and in which it deposits its
eggs]: (S, K:) pl. دَحَارِيجُ. (S.) ―
-b2-  It also signifies ما تدحرج من القدر: [so in the L and TA:
but the following verse, cited as an ex. of this
signification, suggests that القدر is probably a
mistranscription for القُرْدِ or القُرُدِ, i. e. “ ticks; ”
to which, in several different stages of growth,
the Arabs apply different appellations: (see
حَمْنَانٌ:) and this is rendered more probable by
the fact that, in the L, د and ر are often written
almost exactly alike: if so, the meaning is (assumed tropical:)  A
round tick; or a tick that has become round:
likened, I suppose, to the little ball of dung
above mentioned:] pl. as above: En-Nábighah
says,
أَضْحَتُ يُنَفِّرُهَا الوِلْدَانُ مِنْ سَبَأٍ
كَأَنَّهُمْ تَحْتَ دَفَّيْهَا دَحَارِيجُ
[app. describing a she-camel, and meaning, She
became so that the children of Seba scared her
away, as though they were round ticks biting her
beneath her two sides]. (L, TA. [This verse is
also cited in the M and TA in art. سبأ; but not
there explained.])
مُدَحْرَجٌ pass. part. n. of Q. 1 [as meaning
Rolled along: and rolled down]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [And]
Rounded; or round; syn. مُدَوَّرٌ. (S, K.)
المُدَحْرِجُ [The roller; meaning] the جُعَل [or
species of black beetle mentioned above, voce
دُحْرُوجَةٌ]. (IAar, TA.) ―
-b2-  هَالِبُ الشَّعْرِ and مُدَحْرِجُ
البَعْرِ are [Two] days of winter. (K in art.
