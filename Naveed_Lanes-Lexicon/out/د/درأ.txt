درأ1
دَرَأَهُ, aor.
دَرَاَ, (M, Msb, K,) inf. n. دَرْءٌ (S,
M, Mgh, Msb, K) and دَرْأَةٌ; (K;) and ↓ درّأهُ;
(M, TA; [or this latter has probably an intensive
signification;]) He pushed it, or thrust it; or
pushed it, or thrust it, away, or back; repelled
it; or averted it; syn. دَفَعَهُ; (S, * M, Mgh, *
Msb, K;) namely, a thing. (Msb.) Hence,
كَانَ بَيْنَ عُمَرَ وَمُعَاذِ بْنِ عَفْرَآءَ دَرْءٌ There was,
between 'Omar and Mo'ádh Ibn-'Afrà, a contending, and a mutual pushing or thrusting, &c.
(Mgh.) And دَرَأَ عَنْهُمْ He repelled from them, or
defended them; as also دَرَهَ, which is formed by
substitution from the former, like هَرَاقَ from أَرَاقَ.
(S in art. دره.) And دَرَأَ عَنْهُ الحَدَّ He averted
(دَفَعَ) from him the prescribed castigation: (M,
Mgh:) or he deferred his prescribed castigation:
and in like manner the verb is used in relation to
other things. (AZ, T.) It is said in a trad.,
اِدْرَؤُوا الحُدُودَ بِالشُّبُهَاتِ [Avert ye, or defer ye, the
prescribed castigations on account of dubious circumstances]. (ISk, M, TA.) And اِدْرَؤُوا الحُدُودَ
مَا اسْتَطَعْتُمْ [Avert ye, or defer ye, the prescribed
castigations as long as ye are able]. (S, form a
trad.) ―
-b2-  See also 5. ―
-b3-  دَرَأَ عَنِ البَعِيرِ الحَقَبَ is
explained by Sh as meaning He pushed back the
kind girth of the camel: but AM says that the
correct meaning is, he spread the kind girth upon
the ground, and made the camel to lie down upon
it [in order that he might gird him]. (TA.)
[For] دَرَأَ signifies also He spread, or laid flat,
(K, TA,) a thing upon the ground. (TA.) ―
-b4-
دَرَأَ الشَّىْءَ بِالشَّىْءَ He supported the thing by the
thing; made the. thing to be a support to the
thing. (TA.) [Hence,] دَرَأَ الحَائِطَ بِبِنَآءٍ He conjoined the wall with a structure [so as to support
the former by the latter]. (TA.) ―
-b5-  دَرَأَ بِحَجَرٍ
He cast a stone; like رَدَأَ. (TA.) You say,
دَرَأَهُ بِحَجَر and رَدَأَهُ بِهِ He cast a stone at him.
(M in art. ردأ.) ―
-b6-  دَرَأَ said of a torrent, (K,)
inf. n. دَرْءٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  It rushed, or poured forth
with vehemence; as also ↓ اندرأ. (K.) And
دَرَأَ الوَادِى بِالسَّيْلِ (assumed tropical:)  The valley poured along the
torrent. (TA.) [See also دَرْءٌ, below.] ―
-b7-  دَرَأَ,
(K,) inf. n. دُرُوْءٌ, (TA,) is syn. with طَرَأَ [He
came from a place, or from a distant place, unexpectedly; &c.]. (K.) And you say, دَرَأَ عَلَيْنَا
فُلَانٌ, (T, S, K, * TA,) inf. n. دُرُوْءٌ (S, TA) and
دَرْءٌ; (TA;) and ↓ اندرأ (S, TA) and ↓ تدرّأ; (TA;)
Such a one came, or came forth, upon us unexpectedly, (T, S, K, * TA,) or whence we knew not;
as also طَرَأَ, (T,) and دَرَهَ. (IAar, TA in art. دره.)
And عَلَيْهِ بِشَرٍّ ↓ اندرأ, vulg. اندرى, He came
upon him suddenly with evil, or mischief. (TA.)
―
-b8-  Hence, i. e. from دَرَأَ signifying “ he came, or
came forth, unexpectedly,” (T, S, TA,) دَرَأَ, inf. n.
دُرُوْءٌ, said of a star, meaning (tropical:)  It shone, or glistened, (S, K, TA,) intensely, (S, TA,) and its
light spread: (TA:) or, as some say, it rose.
(T.) [Hence also,] دَرَأَتِ النَّارُ (assumed tropical:)  The fire gave
light, shone, was bright, or shone brightly.
(Sh, K.)
-A2-  دَرَأَ, (T, S, K,) aor.
دَرَاَ, (T,) inf. n.
دُرُوْءٌ, (T, S,) He (a camel) had what is termed
the غُدَّة, (S, K,) i. e. the plague, or pestilence,
(طَاعُون,) of camels, (T,) and had therewith a
tumour in his back, (S, K,) or in his نَحْر [or
stabbing-place, in the uppermost part of the
breast]: but in a female, it is in the udder:
(TA:) or had a tumour in his نَحْر. (IAar, T.)
The epithet applied to the male is ↓ دَارِئٌ: and so,
accord. to ISk, to the female, (T, S,) meaning
Attacked by the غُدَّة in her مَرَاق, (T, and so in a
copy of the S,) thus, without teshdeed to the ق,
signifying the part, of her throat, which is the
place of passage of the water, (T, TA,) or in her
مَرَاقّ [or thin and soft parts of the belly], (so in
one of my copies of the S,) so that the protuberance of the غُدَّة [or pestilential tumour] is
apparent: which protuberance is termed ↓ دَرْءٌ.
(T, S.)

دَرَّاَ see 1, first sentence.

مُدَارَأَةٌ, primarily, (TA,) signifies The act of
opposing; and repelling, or striving to repel:
(S, TA:) or treating in an evil, or adverse,
manner; and opposing: (A 'Obeyd, TA:) or
the putting one off in the matter of a right or
due, by promising to render it time after time;
and treating in an evil, or adverse, and a contrary, manner. (Mgh in arts. درى and شرى.)
One says, دَرَأْتُهُ I repelled him, or strove to repel
him. (T, Msb, K.) And فُلَانٌ لَا يُدَارِئُ وَ لَا يُمَارِى,
(S, TA,) i. e. Such a one does not act in an evil,
or adverse, manner, nor oppose, [nor does he
wrangle, or dispute obstinately:] and لا يُدَارِى,
meaning, accord. to Sgh, if for لا يُدَارِئُ, does not
repel, or strive to repel, him who has a right
from his right. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Accord. to El-Ahmar,
in [the exercise of] good disposition, (T, S,) and
in social intercourse, (S,) it is with and without ء; (T, S;) contr. to the assertion of A 'Obeyd,
who says that in this case it is without ء. (T.)
[F says,] دَارَأْتُهُ is syn. with دَارَيْتُهُ and دَافَعْتُهُ and
لَايَنْتُهُ [the second of which has a meaning explained above; the first and last meaning I
treated him with gentleness or blandishment,
soothed him, coaxed him, or wheedled him; &c.];
thus bearing two contr. significations: (K:) [or]
دَرَأْتُهُ and دَارَيْتُهُ both signify I was fearful, or
cautious, of him; and treated him with gentleness or blandishment, or soothed him, coaxed him,
wheedled him, or cajoled him: (S:) [but Az
says,] I say that the verb with ء means I was
fearful, or cautious, of him, as says AZ; or of
his evil, or mischief: and دَارَيْتُ signifies “ I
deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or
outwitted; ” as also دَرَيْتُ. (T.)
4
أَدْرَأَتْ بِضَرْعِهَا, (AZ, T, S,) inf. n. إِدْرَآءٌ, (AZ,
T,) [as also اذرأت, with ذ,] She (a camel) excerned
(أَنْزَلَتْ) the milk, (AZ, T, S,) and relaxed her
udder, on the occasion of bringing forth. (AZ, S.)
The epithet applied to the she-camel so doing is
↓ مُدْرِئٌ. (AZ, T, S, K.)

تَدَرَّاَ see 1. ―
-b2-  تدرّأ عَلَيْنَا He domineered over us.
(S.) And تدرّؤوا عَلَيْهِمْ They domineered over
them, (K, TA,) and aided one another against
them. (TA.) ―
-b3-  تدرّؤوا, (M, K, TA,) and ↓ اِدَّرَؤُوا
دَرِيْئَةً, (TA,) They concealed themselves from a
thing in order to beguile it, or circumvent it:
(M, K, TA:) or they made use of a ذَرِيعَة [or
دَرِيْئَة] for hunting and spearing or thrusting [or
shooting objects of the chase]: (TA:) and ↓ ادّرأتُ
لِلصَّيْدِ, (S,) or الصَّيْدِ, (K,) I prepared for myself a دَرِيئَة for the chase: (S, K:) and ↓ دَرَأَ
الدَّرِيْئَةَ لِلصَّيْدِ, aor.
دَرَاَ, inf. n. دَرْءٌ, He drove the
دريئة to the chase, and concealed himself by it.
(M.)
6
تدارؤوا They repelled, or strove to repel, one
another (M, Msb, K) in contention, or altercation, (M, K,) and the like; and disagreed. (M.)
اِدَّارَأْتُمْ is originally تَدَارَأْتُمْ, (S, K,) the ت being
incorporated into the د, (S, TA,) because they
have the same place of utterance, (TA,) and the ا
being added to commence the word: (S, TA:)
the meaning is, Ye disagreed; and repelled, or
strove to repel, one another. (S.) فَادَّارَأْتُمْ فِيهَا,
in the Kur ii. 67, means And ye contended together respecting it; because those who contend
repel one another: or ye repelled, or strove (??)
repel, one another, by each of you casting the
slaughter upon his fellow. (Bd.)

-b2-  The phrase الحُدُودُ
تَنْدَرِئُ بِالشُّبُهَاتِ [The prescribed castigations shall
be, or are to be, averted, or deferred, on account
of dubious circumstances,] is agreeable with
analogy, but has not been heard [from the Arabs
of classical times]. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  اندرأ الحَرِيقُ The
fire [of a burning house &c.] spread, (K, TA,)
and gave light, shone, was bright, or shone
brightly. (TA.)

إِدْتَرَاَ see 5, in two places.
دَرْءٌ and inf. n. of 1 in senses pointed out above.
(S, M, &c.) So of that verb said of a torrent.
(TA.) [Hence,] جَآئَ السَّيْلُ دَرْءًا and ↓ دُرْءًا The
torrent rushed, or poured forth with vehemence, [or
came rushing, &c.,] from a place, (M, K,) or
from a distant place, (TA,) unknown: (M, K,
TA:) or the latter signifies the torrent came
from a distant land or tract. (S.) And جَآءَ
↓ الوَادِى دُرْءًا The valley flowed with the rain of
another valley: if with its own rain, you say,
سَالَ ظَهْرًا: (IAar, M; and the like is said in the
TA in the present art. and in art. ظهر:) or سال
دُرْءًا means it flowed with other than its own
rain; and ظَهْرًا, “with its own rain. ” (TA in
art. ظهر.) Hence ↓ الدُّرْءُ has been metaphorically
used by a rájiz to signify (tropical:)  The flowing of water
from the mouths of camels into their insides.
(M.)
-A2-  A bending; (TA;) a crookedness, or
curvity; (S, M, K, TA;) in a cane, or spearshaft, and the like; (M, K;) or in a staff, and
anything that is hard to straighten: (T, TA:)
pl. دُرُوْءٌ. (M.) One says, أَقَمْتُ دَرْءٌ فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  I
rectified the crookedness and opposition, or resistance, of such a one. (S.) And hence, بِئْرٌ ذَاتُ دَرْءٍ
A well having a part [of its shaft] projecting, or
protuberant. (S, O.) And طَرِيقٌ ذُو دُرُوْءٍ A road
having furrows, (M, * K, *) or abrupt, water-worn, ridges, (T, S, M,) and protuberances, and
the like. (T.) ―
-b2-  The extremity, or edge, of a
thing; because it repels therewith. (Ham p. 213.)
―
-b3-  A portion of a mountain that projects, or
juts out, from the rest, (M, K, TA, and Ham
p. 213 in explanation of the pl.,) unexpectedly:
(TA:) pl. as above. (M.) ―
-b4-  See also 1, last
sentence. ―
-b5-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Disobedience, and resistance,
and hatred, or dislike, (T, TA,) and crookedness,
(T,) and disagreement, on the part of a wife.
(T, TA.)
دُرْءٌ: see دَرْءٌ, in three places.
دَرِيْئَةٌ A ring by aiming at which one learns to
pierce or thrust [with the spear] (S, M, K) and
to shoot: (T, * M, K:) said by As to be with ء:
(S:) and also called وَتِيرَةٌ. (S in art. وتر.) 'Amr
Ibn-Maadee-Kerib says,
ظَلِلْتُ كَأَنِّى لِلرِّمَاحِ دَرِيْئَةٌ
أُقَاتِلُ عَنْ أَبْنَآءَ جَرْمٍ وَفَرَّتِ
[I passed the day as though I were a ring for
the spears to be aimed at, fighting in defence of
the sons of Jarm, when they had fled]. (T, S,
M. [See also Ham p. 75, where it is written
دَرِيَّةٌ.]) ―
-b2-  Also A camel, (T, S,) or other thing,
(S,) or anything, (M, K,) by which one conceals
himself (T, S, M, K) from the wild animals, (T,)
or from the objects of the chase, (S, * M, K,) in
order that they may be circumvented, (T, S, M,
K,) so that when the man is able to shoot, or
cast, he does so: (T, S:) like ذَرِيعَةٌ: (S in art.
ذرع:) accord. to AZ, it is with ء, (S,) because
the دريئة is driven (تُدْرَأُ, i. e. تُدْفَعُ,) towards the
objects of the chase: (T, * S:) but IAth says that
it is دَرِيَّةٌ, without ء; and that it signifies an
animal by means of which the sportsman conceals
himself, leaving it to pasture with the wild animals
until they have become familiar with it and so
rendered accessible to him, when he shoots, or
casts, at them: (TA:) the pl. of دَرِيْئَةٌ is دَرَايَا
and دَرَائئُ with two hemzehs, each of them extr.
[with respect to analogy]. (M, TA.)
دَرِّىْءٌ: see what next follows.
دُرِّىْءٌ: see what next follows.
كَوْكَبٌ دِرِّىْءٌ, (T, S, K, &c.,) like خِمِّيرٌ and
سِكِّيرٌ (S) or سِكِّينٌ, (K,) from دَرَأَ عَلَيْنَا فُلَانٌ;
(S;) and ↓ دُرِّىْءٌ, (M, K,) the only instance of
the measure فُعِّيلٌ except مُرِّيقٌ; (K;) [which
latter word has been mistaken by Golius and
Freytag for a noun qualified by the epithet درّىء;]
but A'Obeyd says that when it is pronounced
with the first letter madmoomeh it is دُرِّىٌّ, without ء, a rel. n. from دُرٌّ, of the measure فُعْلِىٌّ,
[and the like is said in the K, though دُرِّىْءٌ is also
there mentioned as correct,] because there is not
[to his knowledge] in the language of the Arabs
any word of the measure فُعِّيلٌ; and that he who
pronounces it [دُرِّىْءٌ] with ء means that it is
[originally of the measure] فُعُّولٌ, like سُبُّوحٌ, and
that one of its vowels is changed to kesr because
it is deemed difficult of pronunciation; and Akh
mentions also ↓ دَرِّىْءٌ, with ء, of the measure
فَعِّيلٌ, with fet-h to the first letter, (S, TA,) on
the authority of Katádeh and AA; (TA;) (tropical:)  A
star that shines, or glistens, (S, K, TA,) intensely:
(S:) or a star that is impelled in its course from
the east to the west: (M:) accord. to IAar, [a
shooting star;] a star that is impelled (يُدْرَأُ)
against the devil [or a devil; for the Arabs
believed, and still believe, that a shooting star is
one that is darted against a devil when he attempts
to hear by stealth the discourse of the angels in
the lowest heaven]: (T, TA:) and said by some
to signify one of the five planets: (TA in art.
در:) pl. دَرَارِىْءُ; (T, S, M;) said by Fr to be
applied by the Arabs to the great stars of which
the names are not known. (S.)
دَارِئٌ Coming from a place, or from a distant
place, unexpectedly: (M, TA: but only the pls.
of the word in this sense are there mentioned:)
an enemy showing open hostility, or coming forth
into the field to encounter another in battle: and
a stranger: (T:) pl. دُرَأءُ (T, M, TA) and دُرَّآءٌ.
(M, TA.) People say, نَحْنُ فُقَرَآءُ دُرَأءُ [We are
poor men, come from a distant place, or strangers]. (T, TA.)
-A2-  See also 1, last sentence. ―
-b2-
[Hence,] metaphorically used by Ru-beh as
meaning (tropical:)  Swollen with anger. (M, TA.)
السُّلْطَانُ ذُو تُدْرَأٍ, (S, M, * K,) and ↓ تُدْرَأَةٍ, (K,)
accord. to different relations of a trad. in which it
occurs, (TA,) The Sultán is possessed of apparatus [of war], (عُدَّة, S, and so in some copies of
the K,) or might, (عِزّ, so in other copies of the
K,) and power, to repel his enemies: (S, M, *
K: *) accord. to IAth, ذو تدرأ signifies impetuous,
not fearing or dreading; and so, having power to
repel his enemies: (TA:) it is used in relation to
war and contention. (M.) You say also, هُوَ ذُو
تُدْرَأٍ and تُدْرَهٍ: and هُوَ ذُو تُدْرَئِهِمْ and تُدْرَهَهِمْ
(TA in art. دره, q. v.)
تُدْرَأَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
مُدْرِئٌ: see 4.
مِدْرَأٌ A thing with which one pushes, or thrusts;
or pushes, or thrusts, away, or back. (TA.)
[Applied in the present day, pronounced مِدْرَا,
without ء, to A boat-pole.]
ذَاتُ المِدْرَأَةِ The she-camel of violent spirit.
(TA.)
