دقل4
ادقل النَّخْلُ, (inf. n. إِدْقَالٌ, TA,) The palmtrees produced dates such as are termed دَقَل:
(S, Msb, K:) or the dates of the palm-trees
became دَقَل. (Es-Sarakustee, Msb.) ―
-b2-  ادقلت
الشَّاةُ The sheep, or goat, was, or became, lean, or
emaciated, and small in body; despised and little
in the eyes of beholders. (K.)
دَقْلٌ Weakness of the body (IAar, K) of a man.
(IAar, TA.)
دَقَلٌ [A certain kind of palm-trees;] i. q.
خِصَابٌ [not as meaning “ palm-trees having much
fruit,” but as an appellation applied by the people
of El-Bahreyn to the palm-trees which others call
دَقَلٌ: see art. خصب]: (S, O, TA:) in the K,
الخِضَابُ is erroneously put for الخِصَابُ: (TA:)
n. un. with ة: (S:) Az says that دَقَلٌ signifies
species (أَلْوَانٌ, of which the sing. is لَوْنٌ, [but
here meaning varieties,]) of palm-trees; and the
dates thereof are bad, though the دَقَلَة may be
abundant in fruit; and some have red dates, and
some have black; the body of the dates being
small, and the stones being large: (TA:) accord.
to AHn, the term دَقَلٌ is applied to any palmtrees [of which the varieties are] unknown: the
n. un. دَقَلَةٌ is syn. with خَصْبَةٌ, of which the pl.
is خِصَابٌ: and what are termed أَدْقَالٌ [pl. of
دَقَلٌ] are the worst of palm-trees, and their dates
are the worst of dates. (O, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also [The
fruit of the trees thus called; described above;]
the worst of dates: (JK, S, Msb, K:) or a bad
kind of dates: (Mgh:) or dates of which the
kinds are unknown: (M, K:) accord. to EsSarakustee, the fruit of the دَوْم: n. un. with ة.
(Msb.) A rájiz says,
لَوْ كُنْتُمُ تَمْرًا لَكُنْتُمُ دَقَلَا
أَوْ كُنْتُمُ مَآءً لَكُنْتُمُ و شَلَا
[If ye were dates, ye would be dates of the worst
kind; and if ye were water, ye would be such as
distils scantily, in interrupted drops, from a
mountain or rock]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also The mast
(سَهْم) of a ship; (S, K;) from the same word
in the first of the senses explained above; (S;)
in Pers., تِيرِ كِشْتِى, (MA, PS,) and سُتُونْ;
(MA;) i. e., (or so دَقَلَةٌ [the n. un.], JK,) the
tall piece of wood of a ship, (JK, T, M, Mgh,)
fixed in the midst thereof, (JK, T, M,) for the
sail, (JK,) i. e., upon which the sail is extended,
(T,) or [rather] to which the sail is suspended;
(Mgh;) as also ↓ دَوْقَلٌ. (K.)
دَقَلَةٌ n. un. of دَقَلٌ [which see throughout].
(T, S, &c.) ―

and ↓ مُدْقِلٌ A sheep, or goat, lean, or emaciated,
and small in body; despised and little in the
eyes of beholders: pl., of any but the last, دِقَالٌ:
(K:) or, as ISd thinks, the pl., of دَقِيلَةٌ is دَقَائِلُ,
