دَفُقَ (S, Msb, K, &c.) and
دَفِقَ, (Jm,
K,) inf. n. دَفْقٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) and by poetic
license دَفَقٌ, (TA,) He poured it forth, or out:
(S, K:) or he poured it forth, or out, with vehemence: (Mgh, Msb:) namely, water [&c.]. (S,
Mgh, Msb.) And دُفِقَ المَآءُ The water poured
out, or forth: one should not say دَفَقَ المَآءُ: (S:)
or this last, aor.
دَفُقَ, inf. n. دَفْقٌ, signifies the water
poured forth, or out, with vehemence: but As
disallowed its being used in an intrans. sense:
(Msb:) [the forms of the verb commonly used
intransitively are 7 and 5:] accord. to Lth, alone,
(K,) i. e. in the 'Eyn, (TA,) دَفَقَ المآءُ, (K, TA,)
and الدَّمْعُ, aor.
دَفُقَ, (TA,) inf. n. دَفْقٌ and دُفُوقٌ,
signify the water, (K, TA,) and the tears, (TA,)
poured forth, or out, at once: (K. TA:) but
Az disallows this. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] دَفَقَ اللّٰهُ
رُوحَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [God poured forth his spirit; i. e.] God
caused him to die: (K:) or it means may he
die. (S.) As says, I alighted at the abode of an
Arab woman of the desert, and she said to a
daughter of hers, Bring to him the drinking-bowl
(العُسّ): and she brought me a drinking-bowl in
which was milk, and spilled it; whereupon she
said to her دَفَقَتْ مُهْجَتُكِ [May thy blood, or
heart's blood, be poured forth: or, as appears
from a statement above, the right reading is probably دُفِقَتْ]. (TA. [See also مُهْجَةٌ.]) ―
-b3-  One
says also, of a river, or rivulet, and of a valley, دَفَقَ,
[app. for دَفَقَ المَآءَ,] meaning, It became full so
that the water poured forth, or overflowed, or
so that it poured forth the water, from its sides.

verb is also used transitively and intransitively in
relation to a beast: you say, دَفَقْتُ الدَّابَّةَ (assumed tropical:)  I
made the beast to hasten, or go quickly: ―
-b6-  and
دَفَقَتِ الدَّابَّةُ (assumed tropical:)  The beast hastened, or went quickly:
(Msb:) and [in like manner] one says of a quick
camel, فِى مِشْيِهِ ↓ يَتَدَفَّقُ (assumed tropical:)  [He hastens, speeds,
or presses forward, in his pace, or going]: and
الأُتُنُ ↓ تَدَفَّقَتِ The wild she-asses hastened, or

or abundantly; namely, water &c. See an ex.
of the inf. n. used as a pass. part. n. voce دَحِيقٌ.]

تَدْفِيقٌ, (K,) His two hands poured forth largess
(S, K) [copiously, or abundantly, for] it is with

5
تدفّق i. q. تَصَبَّبَ (S, K) [meaning (as the
former is explained in the KL) It poured forth
or out, or became poured forth or out, copiously,
or abundantly; for it is quasi-pass. of دَفَّقَهُ;
though تَصَبَّبَ is said to be quasi-pass. of صَبَّهُ
like اِنْصَبَّ, and though it is said in the TA that
تدفّق is quasi-pass. of دَفَقَهُ like اندفق]. ―

دَافِقٌ [act. part. n. of دَفَقَهُ; Pouring forth or
out, &c.]. دَافِقُ خَيْرٍ [May it be pouring forth

-b2-  مَآءٌ دَافِقٌ means مَدْفُوقٌ
[i. e. Water poured forth or out, &c.]; (IKoot,

to the generality (K, TA) of the leading lexicologists; (TA;) like سِرٌّ كَاتِمْ meaning مَكْتُومٌ,
(IKoot, S, Msb,) and عَارِفٌ meaning مَعْرُوفٌ, and
عَاصِمٌ meaning مَعْصُومٌ, (IKoot, Msb,) after a
manner obtaining among the people of El-Hijáz,
who change the مَفْعُولٌ into فَاعِل when it is used
as an epithet: (Fr, Msb, TA:) or it means ذُو دَفْقٍ
[having a pouring forth or out, &c.]; (Mgh,
Msb, TA;) accord. to Kh and Sb (TA) and
Zj; (Msb, TA;) and in like manner they say
that سِرٌّ كَاتِمٌ means ذُو كِتْمَانٍ: or, accord. to
Lth, [i. e.] in the 'Eyn, it means water pouring

the S, erroneously, العُنُقِ: in the TA without
any vowel signs, app. because needless to any
but the tyro in Arabic.])

-b2-  And
i. q. أَعْوَجُ [here meaning Oblique]: (Aboo-Málik, K:) applied to a هِلَال [or new moon]:

that termed حَاقِنٌ, which means “ having its two
extremities elevated, and its back decumbent: ”
and AZ says the like: (TA:) [or] ادفق applied
to a هلال signifies erect (مُسْتَوٍ [which must here
mean nearly, not exactly, erect,] and white, not
turning sideways upon one of its two extremities:
(K:) [and this also is esteemed more auspicious
than that termed حاقن, q. v.:] so in the “ Nawádir. ” (TA.) ―

K,) and to a mouth, (JK, TA,) Having the
