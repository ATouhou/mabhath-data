دُنَيْنِيرٌ: see the next paragraph.
دِينَارٌ, an arabicized word, (M, K,) from the
Persian [دِينَارْ], (M,) or from دِينْ آرْ, meaning
“ the law brought it ” [into being or circulation]:
(Er-Rághib:) some say, (TA,) its original is
دِنَّارٌ; one of its ن being changed into ى (S,
Msb, K,) to render it more easy to be pronounced,
(Msb,) or that it may not be confounded with
inf. ns., such as كِذَّابٌ; (S, K;) and hence its
pl. is دَنَانِيرُ, (M, Msb,) and its dim. ↓ دُنَيْنِيرٌ:
(M:) this is the opinion generally obtaining:
others say that it is of the measure فِيعَالٌ; but
this opinion is contradicted by the absence of the
ى in [the second syllable of] the pl.; for were
it so, its pl. would be like دَيَامِيسُ, pl. of دِيمَاسٌ:
(Msb:) [it is the name of A certain gold coin;]
its weight is seventy-one barley-corns and a half,
nearly, reckoning the دَانِق as eight grains of
wheat and two fifths; but if it be said that the
دانق is eight grains of wheat, then the دينار is
sixty-eight grains of wheat and four sevenths: it
is the same as the مَثْقَال. (Msb.)
شَرَابٌ دِينَارِىٌّ A kind of wine or beverage, so
called in relation to Ibn-Deenár el-Hakeem, or
because like the دينار in its redness. (TA.)
مُدَنَّرٌ, applied to a دِينَار, (M, K,) and to gold,
(TA,) Coined. (M, K, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also A man
having many دَنَانِير [pl. of دِينَار]. (M, K.) ―
-b3-  Also
(tropical:)  A horse having specks, or small spots, exceeding
what are termed بَرَشٌ: (AO, T, S, M, K:) or
having black and white spots like دَنَانِير: (Mgh:)
or having a spotting (↓ تَدْنِير) of black intermixed
with whiteness predominating over blackness:
(TA:) and of a white colour predominating over
blackness, with a round blackness intermixed with
the former colour upon his back and rump: (M:)
or of a white hue intermixed with red, (أَصْهَبُ,)
marked with round black spots. (A.) ―
-b4-  Also
(tropical:)  A garment, or piece of cloth, with marks, or
figures, like دَنَانِير. (A.)
