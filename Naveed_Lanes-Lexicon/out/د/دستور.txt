دستوردُسْتُورٌ, an arabicized word, (K,) [from the
Persian دَسْتُورْ,] by some of the Arabs, [and in
the present day generally,] pronounced دَسْتُورٌ,
which is not absolutely erroneous, as it is the
original form of the word before its being arabicized, (MF,) The copy, or original, [of the
register, as will be seen from what follows,]
which is made for the several classes [of the
officers and servants of the government], from
which their transcription is made, (expl. by
النُّسْخَةُ المَعْمُولَةُ لِلْجَمَاعَاتِ التَّىِ مِنْهَا تَحْرِيرُهَا, K,)
and in which are collected the rules and ordinances of the King; (TA;) the register (دَفْتَر)
in which are collected the rules of the realm:
(Kull p. 186:) pl. دَسَاتِيرُ. (K.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (tropical:)  The
great wezeer (وَزِير) to whom recourse is had [by
the King] with respect to what he may prescribe
concerning the circumstances of the people, because
he is the possessor of the register so called:
(Mefáteeh el-'Uloom by Ibn-Kemál-Páshà, in
TA; and Kull ubi suprà:) the officer who manages, conducts, orders, or regulates, the affairs
of the King. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also, in the conventional language of astronomy, (tropical:)  An almanac.]
―
-b4-  Also, vulgarly, Permission; leave. (TA.)
[For instance, it is used in this sense by a man
entering a house, or approaching an apartment,
in which he supposes that there may be some
woman whom he should not see unveiled, in
order that she may veil herself or retire: on such
an occasion, he repeats the word دستور several
times as he advances.]
