order to hasten its coming to maturity. (See
“ Albucasis de Chirurgia,” p. 98, where the word
is twice written ذبيلة; once, ذبعيلة; and once,
correctly, دبيلة.) Golius explains دَبْلَةٌ and دُبْلَةٌ
by “ vomica, apostema,” as on the authority of
the S and KL; in neither of which do I find
anything of the kind: nor do I find دَبْلَةٌ even
mentioned in either of those works.] ―
-b2-  See also

دبو and دبى
1
دَبَى, aor. يَدْبِى, inf. n. دَبْىٌ [and app. also
دَبًى, q. v. infrà], He walked, or went, gently, or
in a leisurely manner. (TA.)
2
تَدْبِيَةٌ i. q. صَنْعَةٌ. (K.) You say, دبّاهُ, meaning صَنَعَهُ [He made it, or wrought it; &c.].
(TK.)
4
ادبى, said of the [tree, or shrub, called]
رِمْث, (S,) or of the عَرْفَج, (M, K,) or of each of
these, (TA,) It put forth what resembled [the
young locusts termed] دَبًى; (M, K;) [i. e.] what
came forth, of its leaves, resembled دَبًى; (S;)
and thus became fit to be eaten. (S, M.) [See
أَبْقَلَ and ثَقَّبَ and حَنَطَ; and see also رِمْثٌ, and
عَرْفَجٌ.]
دَبًى or دَبًا [sometimes written with ى and
sometimes with ا] Locusts before they fly: (S:)
or locusts when they [first] put themselves in
motion, and become black, before their wings
grow: in their first state, when they are white,
they are termed سَرْءٌ: (AO, T:) or the smallest
of locusts, and of ants: (M, K:) or [locusts]
after the state of that which is termed سِرْوَةٌ:

↓ جَآءَ بِدَبَى دُبَىٍّ, (M,) or بِدَبَا دُبَىٍّ, and بِدَبَا دُبَيَّيْنِ,
(IAar, T, Mj, K,) and ↓ بِدَبَى دُبَيَّانَ and بِدَبَى
دُبَيَّانٍ, (Th, M,) (assumed tropical:)  He came with, or brought,
much; and what was good: (M:) he came with,
or brought, much property or wealth, or many
cattle: (M, K:) ↓ دُبَىٌّ is a soft tract in EdDahnà, frequented by locusts, which lay their
eggs therein; (M;) it is a spacious place; so
that the phrase [جَآءَ بِدَبَى دُبَىٍّ] is as though it
meant he came with, or brought, property, or
wealth, or cattle, like the [locusts termed] دبا of
the spacious place called دبىّ. (T.) J is in error
as to this phrase: (K, TA:) for it is stated in
the S, as on the authority of IAar, that one says,
جَآءَ فُلَانٌ بِدَبَا دَبَا, meaning Such a one came with,
or brought, property, or wealth, or cattle, like
the دبا in abundance: and thus it is found in his
handwriting: and in the Tekmileh it is written,
as on the same authority, بِدَبَى دَبًى. (TA.)
Accord. to Abu-l-'Abbás [Th], the [right] phrase
is ↓ بِدَبَى دُبِىٍّ: and in one place he says that
↓ دَبىٌّ [thus (for دَبِىٌّ) in the TT as from the T,
but probably a mistranscription for ↓ دُبَىٌّ,] signifies
Much property or wealth, or many cattle: and
accord. to AA, one says, ↓ جَآءَ فُلَانٌ بِدُبَىٌّ, meaning Such a one came with, or brought, property,
or wealth, or cattle, like the دبا. (T.)
-A2-  Also A
gentle, or leisurely, manner of walking or going.
(K. [See 1.])
دَبِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph, last
sentence but one.
دُبَىٌّ: see دَبًى, in five places.
دُبَيَّان: see دَبًى.
دُبًّى: see the next paragraph.
دُبَّآءٌ The gourd: n. un. with ة: (S, Msb:) it
is mentioned in this art. by J and Z [and Fei]:
but accord. to Hr and the K, its proper art. is
دب [q. v.]: accord. to Az, دبأ, for he says that
its measure is فُعَّالٌ: (TA:) some allow its being
written and pronounced ↓ دُبًّى. (TA in art. دب.)
أَرْضٌ مَدْبَاةٌ: see what next follows.
أَرْضٌ مُدْبِيَةٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ مَدْبَاةٌ (S) A land
abounding with [the locusts termed] دَبًى or دَبًا.
(S, M, K.)
أَرْضٌ مَدْبُوَّةٌ: see what next follows.
أَرْضٌ مَدْبِيَّةٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ مَدْبُوَّةٌ, (M, K,)
the و being substituted for the ى as interchangeable therewith, (M,) A land of which the herbage
has been eaten by [the locusts termed] دَبًى or دَبًا.
(S, M, K.)
-A2-  Accord. to Z, both signify [also]
A land that produces دُبَّآء, i. e. gourds. (TA in
art. دب.)
