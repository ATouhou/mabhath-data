درقدَرَقٌ: see what next follows.
دَرَقَةٌ i. q. حَجَفَةٌ, (S, K, TA,) or تُرْسٌ, (Mgh,)
[i. e. A shield,] made without wood and without
sinews: (Mgh, TA:) or made of skins sewed one
over another: (ISd and TA voce حَجَفَةٌ, q. v.:)
pl. ↓ دَرَقٌ, (S, K,) [or rather this is a coll. gen. n.,]
and [the pl. is] أَدْرَاقٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and دِرَاقٌ;
(K;) this last mentioned by IDrd, who says,
they are made of the skins of beasts found in the
country of the Abyssinians, (TA,) [as are shields
thus called in the present day: they are made of
the skin of the hippopotamus, and of other pachydermatous animals; and sometimes of the skin
of the crocodile; generally oval, with a large
protuberance in the middle, behind which is the
handle, and between a foot and a half and two
feet in length.]
-A2-  Also A خَوْخَة [here meaning
sluice] in a rivulet: an arabicized word, from
[the Persian] دَرِيچَهْ. (K, TA.) This is what is
meant by the saying of the lawyers, that the repairing of the درقة is incumbent on the owner of
the rivulet. (TA.)
دِرَّاقٌ: see what next follows.
دِرْيَاقٌ (S, K) and دَرْيَاقٌ (El-Hejeree, K) and
↓ دِرْيَاقَةٌ and ↓ دَرْيَاقَةٌ (K) and ↓ دِرَّاقٌ, (Fr, TA,)
with kesr, like دِنَّارٌ &c., not دَرَّاقٌ, as it would
seem to be from the manner in which it is mentioned in the K, (TA,) [and as it is written in the
CK and my MS. copy of the K,] i. q. تِرْيَاقٌ
[q. v.]. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  Also, (K,) or ↓ دِرْيَاقَةٌ, (TA,)
(tropical:)  Wine; (K, TA;) as being likened to ترياق
[properly so called: a meaning also borne by
تِرْيَاقٌ and تِرْيَاقَةٌ]. (TA.)
دِرْيَاقَةٌ and دَرْيَاقَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in three places.
دَوْرَقٌ A certain measure for wine, or beverage,
(S, A, O, L,) containing the quantity to be drunk
[at once]: a Persian word, [originally دَوْرَهْ or
دُورَهْ,] arabicized: (L, TA:) [J says,] I think it
to be Persian, arabicized: (S:) it is thus correctly written; not, as the context of the K requires it to be in this sense, دَرْدَقٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Also A jar having a loop-shaped handle, (K,
TA,) that is lifted, or carried, by the hand: of
the dial. of the people of Mekkeh: pl. دَوَارِقُ.
(TA.) [In Egypt, it is applied to A narrownecked drinking-bottle, made of a dust-coloured,
or grayish, porous earth, for the purpose of cooling the water by evaporation: several varieties
of this kind of bottle are figured in ch. v. of my
“ Modern Egyptians. ”]
