دَسَمٌ a word of well-known meaning; (S;)
i. q. وَدَكٌ; (M, K;) both signifying Grease, or
gravy; i. e. the dripping that exudes from flesh-meat and from fat; (Msb in art. ودك;) the وَدَك
of flesh-meat and of fat: (Mgh: [in the CK,
الوَرَكُ is erroneously put for الوَدَكُ:]) or, accord.
to the T, anything that has وَدَك, of flesh-meat
and of fat: (TA:) and dirt, or filth: (M, K:)
and ↓ دَسْمٌ signifies the same as دَسَمٌ, accord. to
El-Kurtubee; but El-Welee El-'Irákee says, I
have not seen this on the authority of any other
lexicologist. (TA.) You say, يَدُهُ مِنَ الدَّسَمِ سَلِطَةٌ
[app. meaning, if correctly transcribed, His hand
is hard by reason of dirt adhering to it: in my
MS. copy of the K, the last word is written
سَطِلَةٌ; a word which I do not find in any sense:
in the TK, سطلة: this Freytag thinks to be the
right reading, though I know of no such word;
and he renders the phrase, “manus ejus propter
sordes inhaerentes catinus est; ” evidently assuming that سطلة is a dial. var. of سَطْلٌ]. (K.)
[It seems that you say also, مَا فِيهِ دَسَمٌ meaning
(assumed tropical:)  There is not in him, or it, any profit, or good:
a sense assigned in the TA to the phrase ما فيه
ديسم دسم; in which I think it evident that the
transcriber has written ديسم by mistake, and
forgotten to erase it after adding دسم.) ―
-b2-  Also
The bowels, or intestines. (TA.)
-A2-  Accord. to
IAar, it means also كَثِيرُ الذِّكْرِ [Praising, or
glorifying, God, much]; a sense in which it is
incorrectly said in the K to be ↓ دَسِيمٌ, like أَمِيرٌ:
(TA:) and hence the trad., of weak authority,
لَا يَذْكُرُونَ اللّٰهَ إِلَّا دَسَمًا: (K:) or, accord. to Z,
this is from دَسَمَ said of rain: and, as related by
Abu-d-Dardà, the words are أَرَضِيتُمْ إِنْ شَبِعْتُمْ
عَامًا أَلَّا تَذْكُرُونَ اللّٰهَ إِلَّا دَسَمًا, meaning [Do ye
approve, if ye be satisfied in your stomachs
throughout a year,] that ye should not praise, or
glorify, God, save a little? (TA:) or it may
denote commendation; so that the meaning of
لا يذكرون اللّٰه الّا دسمًا is, that praise, or glorification, is the stuffing of their hearts and of their
mouths: and it may denote discommendation;
as meaning that they praise, or glorify, little;
from تَدْسِيمُ نُونَةِ الصَّبِىِّ; (K, TA;) the blackness
denoted by this phrase being small in quantity:
or, as some say, the meaning is, that they do not
praise, or glorify, God for anything but eating,
and the grease, or gravy, in their insides. (TA.)
دَسِمٌ A thing greasy; or having in it, or upon
it, grease or gravy, (M, Mgh,) of flesh-meat or
of fat: (Mgh:) [and dirty, or filthy: pl. دُسْمٌ;
like as ذُرْبٌ is pl. of ذَرِبٌ.] You say مَرَقَةٌ دَسِمَةٌ
[Greasy broth]. (TA.) And ثِيَابٌ دُسْمٌ, Dirty,
or filthy, garments. (S, TA.) And دَسِمَ الثَّوْبِ,
applied to a man, [Dirty in the garment: and
hence, going on foot;] not riding; as also ↓ أَدْسَمُ
الثَّوْبِ. (TA.) [Hence also,] (assumed tropical:)  Defiled by culpable dispositions. (TA.) A rájiz says,
لَاهُمَّ إِنَّ عَامِرَ بْنَ جَهْمِ
أَوْذَمَ حَجًّا فِى ثِيَابٍ دُسْمِ
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [O God, verily 'Ámir Ibn-Jahm]
hath imposed upon himself, (S in art. وذم,) or
hath performed, (M,) pilgrimage being defiled by
sins. (S in art. وذم, and M.) ―

↓ دَسْمَآءُ. (Az, Mgh, TA.) And دَسِمٌ occurs in a
trad. as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Strict, or pious, [though]
black, (أَسْوَدُ, [or this may here mean a genuine
Arab, as opposed to أَحْمَرُ meaning a foreigner,])
and religious. (TA.)
أُمُّ دَسْمَة [probably a mistranscription for أُمُّ
↓ دُسْمَةٍ, lit. “ the mother of blackness; ”] (assumed tropical:)  The
cooking-pot. (T in art. ام.)
-A2-  آخِرُ دَسْمَةٍ i. q.

دُسْمَةٌ A thing with which a hole in a skin for
water or milk is stopped up. (M, K.)
-A2-  Blackness; (IAar, TA;) [and] so ↓ دَيْسَمٌ: (K:) or

the Abyssinian is called أَبُو دُسْمَةٍ. (IAar, TA.)
See also أُمُّ دَسْمَة, above.
-A3-  Applied to a man,
(assumed tropical:)  Low, or ignoble; base; vile; mean, or sordid:
(S, TA:) or bad, corrupt, base, or vile. (M, K.
[Freytag erroneously assigns the meaning “ vilis ”
to أَدْسَمُ.]) One says, مَا أَنْتَ إِلَّا دُسْمَةٌ (tropical:)  Thou
art none other than one in whom is no good.
(TA.)
دِسَامٌ A stopper; (M, K;) a thing with which
one stops up the ear, and a wound, and the like,
and the head of a flask or bottle, and the like.
(S.) It is said in a trad. that the Devil has a
دِسَام; meaning that he has a stopper by which
he prevents one from seeing the truth (M, TA)
and from keeping in mind admonition. (TA.)

only meaning allowed by Abu-l-Ghowth. (S.)
Also, (K,) or as some say, (M,) The young one

the companion of Kutrub, A [young ant, such as

erroneously written دَسَمَة] has this last signification. (S, K, TA.)
