دلج1
دَلَجَ, (S, L, K,) aor.
دَلُجَ (S, L) and
دَلِجَ, (L,)
inf. n. دُلُوجٌ, He transferred the bucket from the
mouth of the well to the watering-trough, to
empty it therein: (S, K:) or he took the bucket,
when it came forth, and went with it whithersoever he pleased. (TA.) One says also, هُوَ يَدْلُجُ
بِالدَّلْوِ and يَدْجُلُ بِهَا: the latter verb being formed
by transposition. (Fr, TA in art. دجل.) ―
-b2-  And

been milked, to the [large bowls called] جِفَان.

ادلج, (inf. n. إِدْلَاجٌ, Msb, TA,) He journeyed from the beginning of the night: and
↓ اِدَّلَجَ he journeyed from the latter part of the
night: (Th, S, K:) or the former signifies he
journeyed all the night: and ↓ the latter, he
journeyed in the latter part of the night: (A,
Msb, TA:) or the former, he journeyed in the
night, at any hour from the beginning to the
end thereof: (Th, from Aboo-Suleymán ElAarábee:) or, accord. to El-Fárisee, ↓ both these
verbs are syn., and each bears the first and second
of the significations given above: IDrst contends
against the assertions of those who make a difference between them, and affirms them to be syn.,
and to signify he journeyed in the night, at any
time, in the beginning or middle or end thereof:
therefore, he says, their signification is restricted,
in several examples, by the context; and hence,
he adds, the appellation مُدْلِجٌ given to a hedgehog: (TA:) [agreeably with this explanation,]
'Alee says,
اِصْبِرْ عَلَى السَّيْرِ وَالإِدْلَاجِ فِى السَّحَرِ
[Endure thou with patience travelling, and journeying in the night, in the period a little before
daybreak]. (MF.) [See another ex. voce أَصْبَحَ.]
