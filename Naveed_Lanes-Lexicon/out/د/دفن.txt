↓ دفّنهُ signifies the same; [but app. in an intensive sense or applying to a number of objects;]
(M, TT;) or ↓ اِدَّفَنَهُ, of the measure اِفْتَعَلَهُ. (K.
[So too, accord. to the TA, in the M; but in the

reputation, دَفَنْتَ نَفْسَكَ فِىحَيَاتِكَ (tropical:)  [Thou hast

(M, TA.) And دَفَنْتُ الحَدِيثَ (assumed tropical:)  I hid or concealed, the information, or news, &c. (Msb.) ―

لَا يَكَادُ النَّاسُ يَتَدَافَنُونَ [The people can hardly, or
cannot nearly, bury one another] is said in the

ذَرِيغٌ.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] تَدَافَنُوا (tropical:)  They practised concealment, one with another; syn. تَكَاتَمُوا. (S, K,
TA.) It is said in a trad., لَوْ تَكَاشَفْتُمْ لَمَا تَدَافَنْتُمْ
(tropical:)  [If ye revealed, one to another his faults, or his
secrets, ye would not practise concealment, one
with another, in any case]; meaning, if the fault,
(عَيْب, as in my copies of the S and in the TA in
the present art.,) or secret or secrets, (غَيْب, as in
one of my copies of the S in art. كشف,) of each
one of you were open, or revealed, to each other
of you: (S, TA:) or, accord. to IAth, [if ye
revealed, one to another his secrets, ye would not
bury one another; for he says that] the meaning
is, if each one of you knew what is concealed in
the mind of each other of you, the conducting of
his funeral, and his burial, would be deemed
onerous. (TA in art. كشف.)

اندفن It was, or became, buried, or interred;

-b2-  Also, said of a
portion of a well, (S,) or of a well [absolutely],
and of a watering-trough or tank, and of a water-ing-place, or spring to which camels came to
water, (M, K, TA,) [and] so ↓ ادّفن, (T,) [It was,
or became, filled up, stopped up, or choked up,
with earth or dust; (see 1, of which each of these
verbs is a quasi-pass.;) or] it had the dust swept

stopped up, or choked up]. (T, TA.)

اِدَّفَنَ, of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ: see 7, in two
places. ―
-b2-  Also, said of a slave, He ran away
[given without any addition as one of the explanations in the S] before arriving at the city [or
place] in which he was to be sold: (T, M, K:)
this is not a running away (إِبَاق) for which he is
to be returned [to the seller]: so says Yezeed Ibn-Hároon: but he adds that if he arrive there and
run away, he is to be returned for it, though he
do not absent himself from that city [or place]:
(T:) or he absented himself, (T,) or stole away,
(S, M, Mgh,) from his owners [or owner] for a
day or two days, (T, S, M, Mgh,) as AZ says,
(T, S,) or, (T, M,) as AO says, (T, S,) without
absenting himself from the city [or place in which
he was sold]; (T, S, M, Mgh;) as though he
buried himself in the houses of that city [or place]
in fear of punishment for an offence that he had
committed: (Mgh:) thus, agreeably with the explanations of AZ and AO, the verb is used by the
Arabs: (A'Obeyd, T:) and the epithet ↓ دَفُونٌ,
applied to a slave, means one who does as is described above; (K;) or who is wont to do so: (T,
S, M, Mgh:) or the verb signifies he fled from
his owner, or from hard, or severe, work, but did
not go forth from the town, or the like; and the
doing so is not a fault [for which he may be
returned to the seller], for it is not termed إِبَاق.
