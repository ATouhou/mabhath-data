accus.: and “ Contendit contra alium: Provocavit:
pecul. rem vindicans sibi vel arrogans. ”]

claim to it; or demanded it for himself: and he

and S in art. اكل.) هٰذَا الَّذِى كُنْتُمْ بِهِ تَدَّعُونَ,
in the Kur [lxvii. 27], means This is that on
account of which ye used to assert vain and false
things: or which ye used to deny, or disbelieve:
or, accord. to Fr, the latter verb may here be
used in the sense of تَدْعُونَ; and the meaning
may be, this is that which ye desired to hasten,
and for which ye prayed to God in the words of
the Kur [viii. 32], “O God, if this be the truth
from Thee, then rain Thou upon us stones from
Heaven, or bring upon us some [other] painful
punishment: ” it may be from الدُّعَآءُ: and it may
be from الدَّعْوَى: (TA:) [i. e.] it means this is
that which ye used to demand, and desire to hasten;
from الدُّعَآءُ: or that which ye used to assert,
[namely,] that there will be no raising to life;
from الدَّعْوَى. (Bd.) And وَلَهُمْ مَا يَدَّعُونَ, in the
Kur [xxxvi. 57], is explained as meaning And
they shall have what they desire, or wish for;
which is referrible to the meaning of الدُّعَآءُ.

is not his father asserts him to be his son; or
claims him as his son]. (T, Msb.) الاِدِّعَآءُ in
war signifies The asserting one's relationship;
syn. الاِعْتِزَآءُ; (S, TA;) as also ↓ التَّدَاعِى;
(TA;) i. e. the saying “ I am such a one the
son of such a one. ” (S.) And [hence] sometimes it includes the meaning of Informing, or
telling; and therefore بِ may be prefixed to
its objective complement; so that one says, فُلَانٌ
يَدَّعِى بِكَرَمِ فِعَالِهِ, i. e. Such a one informs of the
generosity of his deeds. (Msb.)

distant from me the space of the call of the man
and of the dog]. (K, TA.) And لَهُمُ الدَّعْوَةُ عَلَى

thee, by the declaration of the faith whereby the
people of false religions are called: دَاعِيَةٌ being
an inf. n. syn. with دَعْوَةٌ, like عَافِيَةٌ and عَاقِبَةٌ:

of Er-Rabáb, who pronounce it, in this sense,
↓ دِعْوَةٌ: (A 'Obeyd, S, M, Msb:) it is an inf. n.
in this sense, (S,) or a simple subst.: (Msb:)
and ↓ دُعْوَةٌ signifies the same; (K;) or, as some
say, this, which is given as on the authority of
Ktr, is a mistake: (TA:) and so does ↓ مَدْعَاةٌ
[app. an inf. n.]. (S, Msb, K.) You say, كُنَّافِى
دَعْوَةِ فُلَانٍ and ↓ مَدْعَاتِهِ, meaning [We were included in] the invitation (دُعَآء [see 1]) of such a
one to food: (S, Msb: [but in the latter, نَحْنُ,
in the place of كُنَّا:]) [or we were at the repast,
or feast, or banquet, of such a one; for] you say
[also] دَعَاهُ إِلَى الدَّعْوَةِ and ↓ الى المَدْعَاةِ [He

by a person who is not his father: (Az, Msb:)

to the pronunciation of 'Adee of Er-Rabáb, (M,
TA,) and ↓ دَاعِيَةٌ; (TA, there said to be syn.
with دَعْوَى;) [meaning An assertion that a
thing belongs to one, or is due to one; a claim;
as is indicated in the S and Mgh and K &c.;] a
demand; a suit; (Yz, Az, Msb;) whether true
or false: (Mgh, K, TA:) the pl. of دَعْوَى is
دَعَاوٍ and دَعَاوَى; the former of which is preferable accord. to some, being, as IJ says, the
original form; but some say that the latter is
preferable: (Msb:) [the latter only is mentioned
in the Mgh:] the alif in the sing. [written ى]
is a sign of the fem. gender; and therefore the
word is without tenween. (Mgh.) Yz mentions
the sayings, لِى فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ دَعْوَى I have, in
respect of this thing, [a claim or] a demand, and
دَعَاوَى or دَعَاوٍ [claims or] demands, as written in
different copies. (Az, Msb.) And لَوْ أُعْطِىَ النَّاسُ

(S:) [both, used as simple substs., signify A
prayer, or supplication, to God:] and the pl. of
the former is أَدْعِيَةٌ. (S.) IF says that some of
the Arabs, for ↓ دَعْوَةٌ, say ↓ دَعْوَى, with the fem.
alif [written ى]. (Msb, TA.) One says, اَللّٰهُمَّ
المُسْلِمِينَ ↓ أَشْرِكْنَا فِى دَعْوَى, meaning [O God,
make us to share] in the prayer (دُعَآء) of the
Muslims. (TA.) And hence, in the Kur [x. 10],
فِيهَا سُبْحَانَك اللّٰهُمَّ ↓ دَعْوَاهُمْ [Their prayer in it
shall be سبحانك اللّٰهمّ]. (TA.) [دُعَآءٌ followed
by لِ signifies An invocation of good, a blessing,
