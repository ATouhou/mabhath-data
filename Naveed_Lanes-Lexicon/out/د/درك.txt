درك1
دَرَكَ, from which should be derived دَرَاكِ and
دَرَّاكٌ, is unused, though its noun درك [i. e. دَرْكٌ
or دَرَكٌ, which latter (the more common of the
two) see below,] is used. (IB.) [دَرَكَ in Golius's
Lex. is evidently a mistranscription for دَارَكَ.]
2
تَدْرِيكٌ The dropping of rain with close consecutiveness, (IAar, K, TA,) as though one portion
thereof overtook another. (IAar, TA.) You say,
درّك المَطَرُ The rain dropped with close consecutiveness. (TK.) ―
-b2-  Also The hanging a rope
upon the neck of a person in coupling him with
another. (AA.)
3
دِرَاكٌ The making one part, or portion, of a
thing, (K, TA,) whatever it be, (TA,) to follow
another uninterruptedly; (K, TA;) as also
مُدَارَكَةٌ: (TA:) both [are inf. ns. of دارك, and]
signify the same [i. e. the continuing, or carrying
on, a thing uninterruptedly]: (S:) مُدَارَكَةٌ is
when there are no intervals between things following one another; like مُوَاصَلَةٌ: otherwise it
is مُوَاتَرَةٌ. (S and K in art. وتر.) You say, of a
man, دارك صَوْتَهُ He continued his voice uninterruptedly. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also A horse's overtaking, or coming up with, wild animals (K, TA)
&c. (TA.) You say, of a horse, دارك الوَحْشَ,
inf. n. دِرَاكٌ, He overtook, or come up with, the
wild animals. (TK.) [Thus it is syn. with ادرك.]
―
-b3-  In the saying, لَا بَارَكَ اللّٰهُ فِيهِ وَلَا دَارَكَ,
(S, K, * TA,) it is an imitative sequent: (K, TA:)
all these verbs have one and the same meaning.
(S, TA. [See تَارَكَ.])
4
ادركهُ, (S Msb, K, &c.,) inf. n. إِدْرَاكٌ (S,
Msb) and مُدْرَكٌ, (Msb,) He, or it, attained,
reached, overtook, or came up with, him, or it:
(S, K, TA:) or sought, or pursued, and attained,
reached, &c., him, or it: (Msb:) [داركهُ, also,
signifies the same, as shown above:] and ↓ تداركهُ,
likewise, [of which اِدَّراَكَهُ is a variation,] is syn.
with ادركهُ; (Jel in lxviii. 49, and KL, * and
TA; *) and so is ↓ اِدَّرَكَهُ. (TA.) You say,
أَدْرَكْتُ الرَّجُلَ and ↓ اِدَّرَكْتُهُ [I attained, reached,
overtook, or came up with, the man]. (IJ,
TA.) And مَشَيْتُ حَتَّى أَدْرَكْتُهُ I walked, or
went on foot, until I overtook him, or came up
with him. (S, TA.) And عِشْتُ حَتَّى أَدْرَكْتُ زَمَانَهُ
I lived until I attained, or reached, his time.
(S, TA.) And أَدْرَكْتُ الفَائِتَ [I attained, &c.,
that which was passing away]. (Mgh.) And
ادركهُ بِمَكْرُوهٍ [He overtook him, or visited him,
with some displeasing, or abominable, or evil,
action]. (M and K in art. وتر. See also 6, in the
latter half of the paragraph, in two places: and
see 10, first sentence.) And أَدْرَكَنِى الجَهْدُ [Difficulty, or distress, &c., overtook me, ensued to
me, or came upon me]; a phrase similar to بَلَغَنِى
الكِبَرُ in the Kur [iii. 35]: and so أَدْرَكْتُ الجَهْدَ
[I came to experience difficulty, &c.]; like بَلَغْتُ
مِنَ الكِبَرِ عُتِيًا in the Kur [xix. 9]. (Er-Rághib,
TA in art. بلغ.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, He attained, obtained, or acquired, it; and so ↓ تداركهُ, as is
shown in the KL; so too ادرك بِهِ, for one says,]
ادرك بِدَمِهِ [He obtained revenge, or retaliation,
for his blood]. (S in art. وتر.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also,
He perceived it; attained a knowledge of it by
any of the senses.] You say, أَدْرَكْتُهُ بِبَصَرِى [I
perceived it by my sight;] I saw it. (S, TA.)
لَا تُدْرِكُهُ الأَبْصَارُ, in the Kur [vi. 103], means,
accord. to some, The eyes [perceive him not]:
accord. to others, the mental perception comprehendeth not [or attaineth not the knowledge of]
the real nature of his hallowed essence. (TA.)
You say also, ادرك عِلْمِى, meaning My knowledge comprehended that such a thing was a fact.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  [Hence likewise, as an intrans. v., or a
trans. v. of which the objective complement is
understood,] ادرك also signifies [He attained a
knowledge of the uttermost of a thing; or] his
knowledge attained the uttermost of a thing.
(TA.) See also 6, in the former half of the paragraph, in two places. ―
-b5-  Also It (a thing)
attained its proper time: (Msb, K:) it attained
its final time or state, or its utmost point or
degree. (K.) [He (a boy, and a beast,) attained
his perfect, ripe, or mature, state; and in like
manner ادركت is said of a girl: or it is like ادرك
as meaning] he (a boy) attained to puberty, (S,
Msb,) or to the utmost term of youth. (TA.)
It (fruit) attained to ripeness, or maturity;
became ripe, or mature; (S Msb;) attained its
time, and its utmost degree of ripeness or maturity.
(T, TA.) And ادركت القِدْرُ The cooking-pot
attained its proper time [for the cooking of its
contents]. (TA.) And ادركت الخَمْرُ [The wine
became mature]. (Msb and K in art. خمر.) And
ادرك مَآءُ الرَّكِيَّةِ The water of the well reached its
دَرَك, i. e. its bottom (Aboo-' Adnán, TA.) ―
-b6-  Also
It passed away and came to an end; came to
nought; became exhausted; or failed entirely:
(S, K:) said in this sense of flour, or meal: (S:)
and thus it has been explained as used in the
Kur [xxvii. 68], where it is said, [accord. to one
reading,] بَلْ أَدْرَكَ عِلْمُهُمْ فِى الآخِرَةِ [Nay, their
knowledge hath entirely failed respecting the
world to come]. (TA. [See also 6.]) Sh mentions this signification as heard by him on no
other authority than that of Lth; and Az asserts
it to be incorrect: but it has been authorized by
more than one of the leading lexicologists, and
the language of the Arabs does not forbid it; for
it is said of flour, or meal, and in this case can
only mean it came to its end, and entirely failed,
or became exhausted; and fruits, when they are
ripe (إِذَا أَدْرَكْتْ) are exposed to coming to
nought, and so is everything that has attained to
its extreme term; so that the signification of
“ coming to nought ” is one of the necessary
adjuncts of the meaning of إِدْرَاكٌ. (TA.) [In
like manner,] ↓ اِدَّرَكَ signifies It (a thing) continued uninterruptedly and then come to nought:
(IJ, TA:) and agreeably with this signification
is explained the saying in the Kur [xxvi. 61],
إِنَّا لَمُدَّرِكُونَ [Verily we are coming to nought,
by those who read thus instead of لَمُدْرَكُونَ being
overtaken]. (TA.) ―
-b7-  You say also, ادرك الثَّمَنُ
المُشْتَرِىَ, meaning [The payment of] the price
was, or became, obligatory on the purchaser:
this is an ideal reaching, or overtaking. (Msb.)
6
تدّاركوا i. q. تلاحقوا (S) [i. e.] They attained, reached, overtook, or came up with, one
another; as also اِدَّارَكُوا, and ↓ اِدَّرَكُوا; (Sh,
TA;) [or] the last of them attained, reached,
overtook, or came up with, the first of them. (S
Msb, K, TA.) Hence, in the Kur [vii. 36], (S,)
حَتَّى إِذَا ادَّارَكُوا فِيهَا جَمِيعًا [Until, when they
have overtaken one another, or have successively
arrived, therein, all together]: originally تَدَارَكُوا.
(S, K. *) And تدارك الثَّرِيَانَ [The two moistures
reached each other; (like اِلْتَقَى الثَّرَيَانِ;) meaning] the moisture of the rain reached the moisture
of the earth. (S.) ―
-b2-  And [hence] تدارك signifies [It continued, or was carried on, uninterruptedly; it was closely consecutive in its
parts, or portions;] one part, or portion, of it,
followed, or was made to follow, another uninterruptedly; said of anything. (TA.) You say,
تدارك السَّيْرُ [The course, or pace, or journeying,
continued uninterruptedly]. (S and TA in art.
حفد, &c.) And تداركت الأَخْبَارُ The tidings
followed one another closely. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence,
when said of knowledge, meaning, accord. to Fr,
It continued unbroken in its sequence or concatenation.] بَلِ ادَّرَاكَ عِلْمُهُمْ فِى الآخِرَةِ (K, TA,)
in the Kur [xxvii. 68], (TA,) [virtually] means
Nay, they have no knowledge respecting the world
to come: (K, TA:) or, as IJ says, their knowledge is hasty, and slight, and not on a sure footing, &c.: Az says that AA read بَلْ أَدْرَكَ [of
which an explanation has been given above (see
4)]: that I'Ab is related to have read ↓ بَلَىآأَدْرَكَ
[&c., i. e. Yea, hath their knowledge reached its
end &c.?], as interrogatory, and without tesh-deed: and that, accord. to the reading بل ادّراك
Fr says that the proper meaning is, [Nay,] hath
their knowledge continued unbroken so as to
extend to the knowledge of the world to come,
whether it will be or not be? wherefore is added,
بَلْ هُمْ فِى شَكٍّ مِنْهَا بَلْ هُمْ مِنْهَا عَمُونَ: he says
also that Ubeí read, أَمْ تَدَارَكَ; and that the
Arabs substitute بَلْ for أَمْ, and أَمْ for بَلْ, when
a passage begins with an interrogation: but this
explanation of Fr is not clear; the meaning is
[said to be] their knowledge shall be unbroken
and concurrent [respecting the world to come]
when the resurrection shall have become a manifest event, and they shall have found themselves
to be losers; and the truth of that wherewith
they have been threatened shall appear to them
when their knowledge thereof will not profit
them: accord. to Aboo-Mo'ádh the Grammarian,
the readings ↓ بَلْ أَدْرَكَ &c. and بَلِ ادَّارَكَ &c.
mean the same; i. e. they shall know in the
world to come; like the saying in the Kur
[xix. 39], أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ, &c.: and Es-Suddee
says of both these readings that the meaning is,
their knowledge shall agree, or be in unison, in
the world to come; i. e. they shall know in the
world to come that that wherewith they have been
threatened is true: or, accord. to Mujáhid, the
meaning of بَلِ ادَّارَكَ عِلْمُهُمْ &c. is said to be, is
their knowledge concurrent respecting the world
to come? بل being here used in the sense of أَم:
(TA:) or it may mean their knowledge hath gone
on uninterruptedly until it hath become cut short;
from the phrase تدارك بَنُو فُلَانٍ meaning The sons
of such a one went on uninterruptedly into destruction. (Bd.)
-A2-  تداركهُ: see 4, in two places.
It is used in the [primary] sense of أَدْرَكَهُ in the
saying in the Kur [lxviii. 49], لَوْ لَا أَنْ تَدارَكَهُ
نِعْمَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّهِ لَنُبِذَ بِالْعَرَآءِ [Had not favour (meaning mercy, Jel) from his Lord reached him, or
overtaken him, he had certainly been cast upon
the bare land]. (Jel.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, elliptically,
He overtook him, or visited him, with good, or
with evil.] El-Mutanebbee says,
أَنَ فِى أُمَّةٍ تَدَارَكَهَا اللّٰ
هُ غَرِيبٌ كَصَالِحٍ فِى ثَمُودِ
[I am among a people (may God visit them with
favour and save them from their meanness, or
visit them with destruction so that I may be safe
from them,) a stranger, like Sálih among Thamood]: تداركها اللّٰه is a prayer for the people,
meaning ادركها ↓ اللّٰه ونجّاهم من لومهم [i. e.
لُؤْمِهِمْ]: or it may be an imprecation against
them, i. e. اللّٰه بالاهلاك لِأَنْجُوَ منهم ↓ ادركهم:
[each meaning as explained above:] and IJ says
that because of this verse the poet was named
المتنبّى. (W p. 35. [The verse there commences
with أَنَا; but أَنَ is required by the metre, and is
more approved in every case except the case of a
pause.]) It is mostly used in relation to aid, or
relief, and benefaction: [so that it signifies He
aided, or relieved, him; he benefited him; he
repaired his, or its, condition; he repaired,
amended, corrected, or rectified, it:] whence the
saying of a poet,
تَدَارَكَنِى مِنْ عَثْرَةِ الدَّهْرِ قَاسِمٌ
بِمَا شَآءَ مِنْ مَعْرُوفِهِ المُتَدارِكِ
[Kásim relieved me, or has relieved me, from the
slip of fortune with what he pleased of his relieving, or continuous, beneficence]. (TA.) [See
also, in the first paragraph of art. دق, another
example, in a verse of Zuheyr, which is cited
in that art. and the present in the TA: and see
the syn. تَلَافَاهُ. Hence,] تَدَارَكْتُ مَا فَاتَ i. q.
استدركتهُ, q. v. (S, Msb, TA.)
8
اِدَّرَكَ: see 4, first and second sentences: ―
-b2-
and near the end of the paragraph: ―
-b3-  and see
also 6, first sentence.
10
استدرك الشَّىْءَ بِالشَّىءِ [properly] signifies
بِهِ ↓ حَاوَلَ إِدْرَاكَهُ [i. e. He sought, or endeavoured, to follow up the thing with the thing]:
(K:) as, for instance, الخَطَأَ بِالصَّوَابِ [the mistake with what was right]. (TK.) [Hence,] you
say, اِسْتَدْرَكْتُ مَافَاتَ [I repaired, amended, corrected, or rectified, what had passed neglected by
me, or by another; and I supplied what had so
passed, or what had escaped me, or another,
through inadvertence]; and ↓ تَدَارَكْتُهُ signifies
the same [in relation to language and to other
things; whereas the former verb is generally
restricted to relation to language or to a writer or
speaker]. (S, Msb.) You say also, استدرك عَلَيْهِ
قَوْلَهُ He corrected, or rectified, what was wrong,
or erroneous, in his saying: [but more commonly,
he supplied what he had omitted in his saying; generally meaning, what he had omitted through inadvertence: and اِسْتَدْرَكْتُهُ عَلَيْه I subjoined it, or
appended it, to what he had written, or said, by
way of emendation; or, more commonly, as a
supplement, i. e., to supply what had escaped
him, or what he had neglected:] and hence,
عَلَى البُخَارِىِّ ↓ المُسْتَدْرَكُ [The Supplement to ElBukháree; a work supplying omissions of ElBukháree;] by El-Hákim. (TA.) [Thus]
اِسْتِدْرَاكٌ signifies The annulling a presumption, or
surmise, originating from what has been before
said, [by correcting an error, or errors, or by
supplying a defect, or defects,] in a manner
resembling the making an exception. (Kull.)
[Hence حَرْفُ اسْتِدْرَاكٍ, meaning A particle of
emendation, applied to بَلْ, and to لٰكِنَّ or لٰكِنْ.]
دَرْكٌ: see the next paragraph, in eight places.
دَرَكٌ The act of attaining, reaching, or overtaking; syn. لَحَاقٌ; (K, TA; [in the CK, اللِّحاقُ
is erroneously put for اللَّحَاقُ;]) [properly an
inf. n. of the unused verb دَرَكَ (q. v.), but, having
no used verb, said to be] a noun from الإِدْرَاكُ
[with which it is syn.], (TA,) or a noun from
أَدْرَكْتُ الشَّىْءَ; as also ↓ دَرْكٌ: and hence ضَمَانٌ
الدَّرَكِ [which see in what follows]. (Msb.)
[Hence,] لَا تَخَافُ دَرَكًا, in the Kur [xx. 80.],
means Thou shalt not fear Pharaoh's overtaking
thee. (TA.) One says also الطَّريدَةِ ↓ فَرَسٌ دَرْكُ,
meaning A horse that overtakes what is hunted;
like as they said فَرَسٌ قَيْدُ الأَوَابِدِ. (TA.) ―
-b2-
―
-b3-  Also The attainment, or acquisition, of an
object of want: and the seeking the attainment
or acquisition thereof: as in the saying, بَكِّرْ فَفِيهِ
دَرَكٌ [Be thou early; for therein is attainment,
&c.]: and ↓ دَرْكٌ signifies the same. (Lth, TA.)
[Hence, perhaps,] يَوْمُ الدَّرِكَ: this was [a day of
contest] between El-Ows and El-Khazraj: (K:)
thought to be so by IDrd. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And i. q.
تَبِعَةٌ [i. e. A consequence; generally meaning an
evil consequence: and perhaps it also means here
a claim which one seeks to obtain for an injury]:
as also ↓ دَرْكٌ. (S, K.) One says, مَا لَحِقَكَ مِنْ
دَرَكٍ فَعَلَىِّ خَلَاصُهُ (S, TA) and ↓ من دَرْكٍ [i. e.
Whatever evil consequence ensue to thee, on me
be the compensation thereof]: in the A, ما أَدْرَكَهُ
من دَرَكٍ فعلىّ خلاصه i. e. مَا يَلْحَقُهُ مِنْ تَبِعَةٍ
[Whatever evil consequence ensue to it, &c.;
relating to a thing sold]. (TA.) And hence
ضَمَانُ الدَّرَكِ in the case of a claim for indemnification for a fault of a defect or an imperfection
in a thing sold [meaning either Responsibility, or
indemnification, (see ضَمَانٌ,) for evil consequence]:
(TA in the present art:) or this means [indemnification for evil consequence in a sale; i. e.,
virtually,] the returning of the price to the purchaser on the occasion of requirement by the thing
sold: the vulgar say incorrectly [ضَمَان دَرَك, and
still more incorrectly] ضُمَان دَرَك [generally meaning thereby I sell this, or I purchase this, on the
condition of responsibility, or indemnification,
for any fault or defect or imperfection that may
be found in it]: (TA in art. ضمن:) [and in this
manner ضَمَانُ الدَّرَكِ may be correctly rendered;
for] دَرَكٌ also signifies a fault or a defect or an
imperfection [in a thing sold]; for instance, in a
slave that is sold. (TA in art. عهد.) [In the
KT, الدَّرَكُ is also explained as signifying The
purchaser's taking from the seller a pledge for
the price that he has given him, in fear that the
thing sold may require it: but this seems to be
an explanation of the case in which the word is
used; not of the word itself.]
-A2-  Also A rope,
(M, K,) or a piece of rope, (S,) that is tied upon
the [lower] extremity of the main rope (S, M, K)
of a well, to the cross pieces of wood of the bucket,
(S,) so as to be that which is next the water,
(S, M, K,) in order that the main rope may not
rot (S, M) in the drawing of water: (M:) or
a doubled rope that is tied to the cross pieces of
wood of the bucket, and then to the main wellrope: (Az, TA:) and ↓ دَرْكٌ signifies the same.
(K. [But only دَرَكٌ is authorized by the TA in
this sense.]) [See also كَرَبٌ.] ―
-b2-  Also, and
↓ دَرْكٌ, The bottom, or lowest depth, (Sh, T, S,
M, K,) of a thing, (T, M, K,) as of the sea and
the like, (T,) or of anything deep, as a well and
the like: (Sh:) pl. أَدْرَاكٌ, (K,) a pl. of both, of a
form frequent and analogous with respect to the
former, but extr. with respect to the latter; and
دَرَكَاتٌ also. (TA.) And A stage of Hell:
(IAar:) a stage downwards: (MA:) or stages
downwards; like دَرَكَاتٌ: (B:) opposed to دَرَجٌ
(MA, B) and دَرَجَاتٌ, (B,) which are upwards:
wherefore, (MA, B,) the abodes of Hell, or the
stages thereof, are termed دَرَكَاتٌ; (AO, S, MA,
K, B;) [Golius and Freytag give دَرَكَةٌ as its
sing.; the former as from the S, and the latter as
from the K, in neither of which it is found;] and
those of Paradise, دَرَجَاتٌ. (S, MA, B.) It is
said in the Kur [iv. 144], إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ فِىالدَّرَكِ
الْأَسْفَلِ مِنَ النَّارِ [Verily the hypocrites shall be
in the lowest stage of the fire of Hell]: here the
Koofees, except two, read ↓ فى الدَّرْكِ. (TA.)
―
-b3-  [Golius gives another signification, “Pars
terræ,” as on the authority of the S and K, in
neither of which it is found.]
دِرْكَةٌ The ring of the bow-string, (K, TA,) that
falls into the notch of the bow. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
A thong that is joined to the string of the bow,
(K,) of the Arabian bow. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And A
piece that is joined to the girdle when it is too
short, (Lh, K,) and in like manner, to a rope, or
cord, when it is too short. (Lh, TA.)
دَرَاكِ an imperative verbal noun, (S,) meaning
أَدْرِكْ [Attain thou, reach thou, overtake thou,
&c.]: (K:) form the unused verb دَرَكَ: (IB:)
like تَرَاكِ [from تَرَكَ], meaning أُتْرُكْ. (TA.)
دِرَاكٌ [an inf. n. of 3, used in the sense of the
part. n. ↓ مُتَدَارِكٌ]. You say, طَعَنَهُ طَعْنًا دِرَاكًا
He thrust him, or pierced him, with an uninterrupted thrusting or piercing: and شَرِبَ شُرْبًا
دِرَاكًا He drank with an uninterrupted drinking:
and ضَرْبٌ دِرَاكٌ An uninterrupted beating or
striking. (TA.)
دِرَاكَةٌ: see مَدْرَكٌ.
دَرِيكَةٌ i. q. طَرِيدَةٌ [as meaning An animal that
is hunted]. (S, K.)
دَرَّاكٌ an epithet from أَدْرَكَ, (S, Kudot;,) applied to a
man, (K,) and signifying كَثِيرُ الإِدْرَاكِ [i. e. One
who attains, reaches, or overtakes, &c., much, or
often: and also having much, or great, or strong,
perception: as will be seen from what follows]:
(S, TA:) and so ↓ مُدْرِكٌ [expressly said in the
TA to signify كثير الادراك, though why it should
have this signification as well as that (which it
certainly has) of simply attaining &c., I cannot
see,] and ↓ مُدْرِكَةٌ: (K, TA:) the last explained
by Lh as signifying سَرِيعُ الإِدْرَاكِ [i. e. quick in
attaining, &c.]. (TA.) Keys Ibn-Rifá'ah says,
↓ وَصَاحِبُ الوِتْرِ لَيْسَ الدَّهْرَ مُدْرِكَهُ
عِنْدِى وَإِنِّى لَدَرَّاكٌ بِأَوْتَارِ
[And he who has a claim for blood-revenge is not
ever an attainer of it with (meaning from) me;
but verily I am one who often attains bloodrevenges]. (IB.) Seldom does فَعَّالٌ come from
أَفْعَلَ; but they sometimes said حَسَّاسٌ دَرَّاكٌ [i. e.
Having much, or great, or strong, perception];
it being [in this instance] a dialectal syn. [of
حسّاس], or thus for conformity: (S:) it is said
to be the only instance of فَعَّالٌ from أَفْعَلَ except
جَبَّارٌ and سَأّرٌ; [and some other instances might
be added; but all of them require consideration:]
accord. to IB, درّاك is from the unused verb دَرَكَ.
(TA.)
مَدْرَكٌ: see مُدْرَكٌ ―
-b2-  لَهُ مَدْرَكٌ [if not a mistranscription for مُدْرِكٌ or مُدْرَكٌ] means He has a
sense in excess; [app. a preternatural perception,
or a second sight;] and so ↓ دِرَاكَةٌ. (TA.)
مُدْرَكٌ A place, and a time, of إِدْرَاكٌ [i. e. attaining, reaching, overtaking, &c.]. (Msb.) Hence
مَدَارِكُ الشَّرْعِ; (Mgh, Msb;) among which is included investigation of the law by means of reason
and comparison; (Mgh;) i. e. The sources from
which are sought the ordinances of the law;
where one seeks for guidance by means of texts
[of the Kur-án or the Sunneh] and by means of
investigation by reason and comparison: (Msb:)
the lawyers make the sing. to be ↓ مَدْرَكٌ; (Mgh, *
Msb;) but there is no way of resolving this:
(Msb:) correctly, by rule, it is مُدْرَكٌ; because
the meaning intended is a place of إِدْرَاك. (Mgh.)
―
-b2-  [Also pass. part. n. of 4. ―
-b3-  And hence, Perceived by means of any of the senses; like
مَحْسُوسٌ: and perceived by the intellect; thus
opposed to مَحْسُوسٌ.]

المُدْرِكَاتُ الخَمْسُ and المَدَارِكُ الخَمْسُ signify
The five senses. (TA.) [See also مَدْرَكٌ.]
-A2-
Also The حَجْمَة [a word I do not find in any
other instance, app. a mistranscription for مَحْجَمَة
(which when written with the article differs very
little from the former word) i. e. the place to
which the cupping-vessel is applied, for this is
