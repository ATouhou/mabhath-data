Ibn-Ez-Zebbán Edh-Dhuhlee, who was slain,
with his brothers, and their heads were put upon
her, (S, K, TA,) in sacks hung upon her neck,
and she returned to Ez-Zebbán: (TA:) whence
the saying, أَثْقَلُ مِنْ حِمْلِ الدُّهَيْمِ [Heavier than
the burden of Ed-Duheym]: (S:) and أَشْأَمُ مِنَ
الدُّهَيْمِ [More unlucky than Ed-Duheym]: (S,
K, TA:) or, as some say, seven brothers were
slain in a warring and plundering expedition, and
were put upon Ed-Duheym; and hence the name
became proverbial as applied to any calamity or
misfortune. (TA.)

to a camel, like أَصْفَرُ, [in this case meaning black

sheep (S, M, Msb, K) or goat, (S, Msb,) means

moisture, or irrigation; and everything that is

new, or recent, mark, trace, or vestige: (As, K:)
and أَغْيَرُ means one that is “old, becoming effaced:”
(As, TA:) and the former means also old, becoming
effaced; (K;) as some explain it; (TA;) thus
having two contr. significations. (K.) And
وَطْأَةٌ دَهْمَآءُ A new, or recent, footstep, or footprint:
and غَبْرَآءُ means “becoming effaced:” or the former
means one that is becoming effaced, because it has

A, K:) or the black cooking-pot: (ISh, TA:) and

TA that this last meaning is a mistake, occasioned
by an omission; and that, instead of القِدْرُ وَالقَدِيمَةُ,
(in the CK القِدْرُ القَدِيمَةُ,) we should read,
القِدْرُ وَالوَطْأَةُ الدَّهْمَآءُ القَدِيمَةُ, explained above.
Accord. to Golius, on the authority of a gloss in
the KL, أَبُو الأَدْهَمِ signifies The great cooking-pot
in which a whole sheep is cooked at once.]) ―
