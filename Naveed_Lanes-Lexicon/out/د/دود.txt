دَادَ, (S, M, Msb, K,) like خَافَ, (Msb,)
[sec. pers. دِدْتَ,] aor. يَدَادُ; (S, M, Msb, K;)
and دَادَ, like قَالَ, [sec. pers. دُدْتَ,] aor. يَدُودُ;
(Msb;) inf. n. دَوْدٌ; (M, L, K; [in my copy of
the Msb دَادٌ, which, I doubt not, is a mistranscription;]) and ↓ اداد, (T, S, M, A, Msb, K,)
inf. n. إِدَادَةٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ دوّد, (T, S, M, A,
Msb, K,) inf. n. تَدْوِيدٌ; (Msb;) and دِيدَ; (M,
L, and so in some copies of the K; [see its
part. n. مَدُودٌ, voce دَائِدٌ, below;] in other copies
of the K دَيَّدَ [which is app. a mistranscription];)
It (corn, or food, طَعَام,) had in it دُود (M, A,
L, Msb, K) or سُوس (S, L) [i. e. worms, grubs,
or maggots]; and became eaten thereby. (L.)
↓ أَعْزِمُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا الجُرْحُ أَنْ لَا تَزِيدَ وَلَا تُدِيدَ [I
conjure thee, O wound, that thou increase not nor
breed worms,] is a form of conjuration used by
the Arabs. (A.)

-A2-  Also He played with
the دَوْدَاة, i. e. أُرْجُوَحة [or seesaw]. (K.)

دُودٌ a word of well-known signification, [Worms,
grubs, maggots, and the like; including molluscs;
as a coll. gen. n.: and, as a simple gen. n., the
worm, grub, maggot, &c.:] pl. of دُودَةٌ [or rather,
as already said, and as is implied in several of
the lexicons, دُودٌ is a coll. gen. n.; therefore دُودَةٌ
is the n. un. thereof]: and the pl. of دُودٌ is
دِيدَانٌ. (T, S, L, Msb. [In the K, دِيدَانٌ is said
to be pl. of دُودَةٌ: and in the L, as from the T,
دُودَانٌ is said to be another pl. of دُودٌ: this, however, I regard as a mistake; for I do not find it
in the T; but I there find added, after دِيدَانٌ,
“ and دُودَانٌ is a tribe of Benoo-Asad. ”]) J says
that the dim. is ↓ دُوَيْدٌ, and that by rule it should
be دُوَيْدَةٌ: but this is a mistake [unless it be
meant that دُوَيْدَةٌ is the regular dim. of دُودَةٌ]:
it is regularly دُوَيْدٌ, like as تُمَيْرٌ and قُيَيْحٌ are
regular dims. of تَمْرٌ and قَمْحٌ, which are pls. [or
rather coll. gen. ns.] of تَمْرَةٌ and قَمْحَةٌ. (IB.)
دُودَةٌ [n. un. of دُودٌ, q. v. ―
-b2-  Also] The fœtus
in the belly of a mare from the fortieth day,
when its make becomes apparent, until the end of
the third month. (Kr, TA voce دُعْمُوصٌ, q. v.)
دَوْدَاةٌ A seesaw; syn. أُرْجُوحَةٌ: (K in this art.,
and T and S in art. دو:) and the mark made by
children upon the dust, or earth, like a path, or
track, when they play [upon the seesaw], doing
thus with their feet, moving forwards and backwards: (S in art. دو:) or the mark of the
ارجوحة: (M and K in that art.:) or the sound
of the ارجوحة: (TA in the present art.:) and
cries, shouts, noises, or clamour; or a confusion,
or mixture, of cries, shouts, &c.: (K in this art.:)
دَوْدَاةٌ is [said by ISd to belong to art. دو, and to
be] originally دَوْدَوَةٌ: (M in art. دو:) the pl. is
دَوَادٍ, (T and S * and M in that art.,) explained by
As as signifying the marks of the أَرَاجِيح [or
seesaws] of children; (TA in the present art.;)
and دَوَادِىَ occurs in a verse, in the gen. case,
(S and M in art. دو,) by poetic license. (M in
that art.)

thereby. (L.)

دَارَ, aor. يَدُورُ, inf. n. دَوْرٌ and دَوَرَانٌ (S, M,
A, Msb, K) and دُؤُورٌ (M) and مَدَارٌ; (Lth, T;)
and ↓ استدار; (M, A, Msb, K;) and ↓ ادار; (M;)
He, or it, went, moved, or turned, round; circled;
revolved; returned to the place from which he,
or it, began to move. (TA.) ―
-b2-  You say, دَارُوا
حَوْلَهُ and ↓ استداروا They went round it: (A:)
and دار حَوْلَ البَيْتِ and ↓ استدار He went
round the house [or Kaabeh]. (Msb.) Z and
others dislike the phrase داربِالبَيْتِ, [which seems
to have been used in the same sense as دار حَوْلَهُ,]
preferring the phrase طَافَ بِالبَيْتِ, because of the
phrase دار بَالدُّوَارِ, signifying He went round
about in the circuit called الدُّوَار, round the idol
called by the same name. (TA.) [بِهِ ↓ استدار
mostly signifies It encircled, or surrounded, or
encompassed, it.] ―
-b3-  [You say also, دار بَيْنَهُمْ It
(a thing, as, for instance, a wine-cup) went
round, or circulated, among them. And] دار

or sphere, revolved upon its axis]: (A:) دَوَرَانُ
الفَلَكِ signifies the consecutive incessant motions
of the several parts of the firmament. (Msb.)
―
-b4-  Hence the saying دَارَتِ المَسْأَلَةُ, [inf. n. دَوْرٌ,]
The question formed a circle; one of its propositions depending for proof upon another following
it, and perhaps this upon another, and so on, and
the latter or last depending upon the admission of
the first. (Msb.) [And in like manner, دار,
inf. n. دَوْرٌ, signifies He reasoned in a circle.]
―
-b5-  It is said in a trad., ↓ إِنَّ الزَّمَانَ قَدِ اسْتَدَارَ
كَهَيْئَتِهِ يَوْمَ خَلْقِ اللّٰهِ السَّمٰوَاتِ وَ الأَرْضَ [Verily
time hath come round to the like of the state in
which it was on the day of God's creating the
heavens and the earth: this was said by Mohammad after he had forbidden the practice of intercalating a lunar month, by which the Arabs had
long imperfectly adjusted their lunar year to the
solar.] (TA.) And one says, دَارَتِ الأَيَّامُ [The
days came round in their turns]. (S and Msb
and K in art. دول.) And يَوْمٌ لَا يَدُورُ فِى شَهْرِهِ
[A day of the week that does not come round
again in its month: as the last Wednesday, &c.].

of an event, as meaning It came about. See an
ex. in a verse cited in art. اذ.] ―

عَلَى أَرْبَعِ نِسْوَةٍ (tropical:)  Such a one has within the circuit
of his rule and care four wives, or women. (A.)
And فُلَانٌ يَدُورُ حَوْلَ فُلَانَةَ وَيُجَمِّشُهَا (tropical:)  [Such a
man has within his power and care such a
female, and toys, dallies, wantons, or holds
amorous converse, with her]. (A and TA in art.
حوض.) And أَنَا أَدُ(??) حَوْلَ ذٰلِكَ الأَمْرِ (tropical:)  [I have
within my compass, or power, and care, that
thing or affair]. (S and A in art حوض.)

about with him; syn. دَارَ مَعَهُ. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  [And
hence, (assumed tropical:)  He circumvented him.] Aboo-Dhu-eyb
says,
حَتَّى أُتِيحَ لَهُ يَوْمًا بِمَرْقَبَةٍ
ذُو مِرَّةٍ بِدِوَارِ الصَّيْدُ وَجَّاسُ
[Until there was prepared for him, one day, in a
watching-place, an intelligent person, acquainted
with the circumvention of game]: وجّاس is here
made trans. by means of ب because it means the
same as عَالِمٌ in the phrase عَالِمٌ بِهِ. (M.) [Or the
meaning of the latter hemistich is, a person possessing skill in circumventing game, attentive to
their motions and sounds.] ―
-b3-  داورهُ also signifies
(assumed tropical:)  He endeavoured to induce him to turn, or
incline, or decline; or he endeavoured to turn
him by deceit, or guile; عَنِ الأَمْرِ from the thing;
and عَلَيْهِ to it; syn. لَاوَصَهُ. (M, K.) It is said
in the trad. respecting the night-journey [of Mo-
hammad to Jerusalem, and his ascension thence
into Heaven], that Moses said to Mohammad,
لَقَدْ دَاوَرْتُ بَنِى إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَى أَدْنَى مِنْ هٰذَا فَضَعُفُوا
[(assumed tropical:)  Verily I endeavoured to induce the children of
Israel to incline to less than this, and they were
unable]: or, accord. to one relation, he said
رَاوَدْتُ. (TA.) See also 4. ―
-b4-  دَاوَرَ الأُمُورَ (tropical:)  He
sought to find the modes, or manners, of doing,

-b3-  إِدَارَةٌ [the
inf. n.] also signifies The giving and taking, from
hand to hand, without delay: and agreeably with

is no building: (T, M, K:) as also ↓ دَارَةٌ:
(M, K:) or the latter is a more special term;
(S;) meaning any particular house; the former
being a generic term: (MF:) accord. to IJ, it is
from دَارَ, aor. يَدُورُ; because of the many movements of the people in it: (M:) it is of the fem.
gender: (S, Msb:) and sometimes masc.; (S, K;)
as in the Kur xvi. 32, as meaning مَثْوَى, or مَوْضِع,
(S,) or as being a gen. n.: (MF:) pl. (of pauc.,
S) أَدْؤُرٌ and أَدْوُرٌ (S, Msb, K) and آدُرٌ, (Abu-l-
Hasan, AAF, Msb, K,) formed by transposition,
(Msb,) [for أَوْدُرٌ,] and أَدْوَارٌ (T, K) and أَدْيَارٌ (T)

&c.] ―
-b2-  Also Any place in which a people have
alighted and taken up their abode; an abode; a
dwelling. (T, Mgh.) Hence the present world
is called دَارُ الفَنَآءِ [The abode of perishableness;

دَارُ البَقَآءِ [The abode of everlastingness; or the
everlasting abode]; and دَارُ القَرَارِ [The abode of
stability; or the stable abode]; and دَارُ السَّلَامِ
[The abode of peace, or of freedom evil]. (T.)

the abode of the transgressors], meaning Egypt:
or, accord. to Mujáhid, the abode to which the
transgressors shall go in the world to come.
(TA.) ―
-b5-  [Hence, also,] دَارٌ signifies i. q. بَلَدٌ

village]. (Mgh, K.) ―
-b6-  And, with the art. ال,
[El-Medeeneh;] the City of the Prophet. (K.)
―
-b7-  And hence, (TA,) دَارٌ also signifies (tropical:)  A tribe;

of the sons of such a one passed by us. (A.)
And in the same sense دار is used in a trad. in
which it is said that there remained no دار among
which (فِيهَا) a mosque had not been built. (TA.)
-A2-  Mtr states that it is said to signify also A
year; syn. حَوْلٌ; and if this be correct, which
he does no hold to be the case, it is from الدَّوَرَانُ,
like as حَوْلٌ is from الحَوَلَانُ: or, as some say,
i. q. دَهْرٌ [as meaning a long time, or the like].
(Har p. 350.)
-A3-  And الدَّارُ is the name of A

دَيْرٌ, originally with و; (T, S;) or originally thus,
with ى, (M, [and so accord. to the place in
which it is mentioned in the A and Msb and K,])
as appears from the occurrence of the ى in its pl.
and in the derivative دَيَّارٌ, for if the ى were in
this case interchangeable with و it would occur in
other derivatives; (M;) [or this is not a valid
reason, for دَيَّارٌ is held by J to be originally دَيْوَارٌ,
i. e. of the measure فَيْعَالٌ; and ISd himself seems
in one place to express the same opinion; in like
manner as دَيُّورٌ is held by the latter to be originally دَيْوُورٌ; and تَدَيَّرَ is evidently altered from
تَدَوَّرَ;] A convent, or monastery, (خان,) of
Christians: (M, K:) and also the صَوْمَعَة [i. e.

being unchanged because of its distance from the
end of the word. (M.) ISd says, in the عَوِيص,

uses it in an affirmative phrase. (MF.) ―

many press to draw, except the kind of buckets
made of a round piece of skin, of ample capacity]:
i. e. one cannot draw water from a small quantity

the latter epithet is added as an explicative of the
former; but this I think an evident mistake.])
