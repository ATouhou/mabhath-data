R. Q. 2
تَدَهْدَهَ, said of a stone, (S, K,) &c.,
(S,) It rolled down; (S,* K,* TA;) as also
تَدَهْدَى. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  And hence, He, or it, was

إِلَّا دَهْ فَلَا دَهْ, (JK, and so in some copies of
the K,) or إِلَّا دَهٍ فَلَا دَهٍ, (As, IAar, S, TA, and
so in copies of the K,) a saying of the Arabs,
meaning If this thing be not now, it will not be
after the present time: (As, S, K:) As says, I
know not its origin, but I think it to be Pers.,
and to mean, if thou strike not him, or it, now,
thou wilt not strike him, or it, ever: (S:) accord.
to IAar, it is said to a man when he is at the
point of accomplishing his want in respect of a
creditor of his, or in respect of his blood-revenge,
or in respect of paying honour to a friend of his;
(TA;) and means if thou seize not the opportunity now, thou wilt never meet with it: (K,
TA:) accord. to Lth, (TA,) it means, if thou
avenge not his blood, or if thou slay him not in
blood-revenge, now, thou wilt never do so. (JK,
TA.) Accord. to As, one says also, لَا دَهٍ فَلَا دَهٍ,
meaning I will not accept either of the two
actions proposed. (TA.) Az says that this saying shows ده to be Pers., and to mean The act of
striking: you say to a man, ↓ دِهْ, meaning
Strike thou: and he says, I have seen it written
with kesr in the book of AZ. (TA.) ↓ دِهْ in
Pers. means Give thou: and metonymically, the
act of striking. (TA.)
دُهْ دُهْ A cry by which camels are chidden;
(IAar, TA;) a cry by which camels are called to
their young ones. (K in art. دوه.)
-A2-  دُهْ دُرَّيْنِ,
or دُهْ دُرَّيْنْ: see art. دهدر.
دِهْ: see دَهْ, last two sentences.
دَهْدَهَةٌ A hundred camels, and more; (JK,
K;) as also ↓ دَهْدَهَانٌ and ↓ دُهَيْدِهَانٌ: (K:) or
↓ the second of these three words signifies many
camels. (JK, S.)
دَهْدَهَانٌ: see what next precedes, in two
places: and what next follows.
دَهْدَاءٌ Small, or young, camels: (JK, S, K:)
pl. دَهَادِهُ. (S, * K.) A rájiz says,
قُلَيِّصَاتٍ وَأُبَيْكِرِينَا  ↓ قَدْ رَوِيَتْ إِلَّا دُهَيْدِهِينَا
[They had satisfied their thirst, except some
small, or young, camels; little young she-camels
and little young he-camels]: as though he formed
from دَهْدَاهٌ the pl. دَهَادِهُ; and from this, the
dim. دُهَيْدِهٌ; and from this, the pl. دُهَيْدِهِينَ [in
the nom. case دُهَيْدِهوُنَ]: (S, TA:*) and in like
manner, أُبَيْكِرِينَ as pl. of أُبَيْكِرٌ, dim. of أَبْكُرٌ, pl.
of بَكْرٌ. (S.) [Accord. to a passage imperfectly
written in the TA, it seems to signify also Many
small, or young, camels; and so, as there written,
دهدان, app. for ↓ دَهْدَهَانٌ.] ―
-b2-  One says also,
مَا أَدْرِى أَىٌّ الدَّهْدَاهِ هُوَ, (TA,) or الدَّهْدَأِ and
الدَّهْدَآءِ, the last on the authority of Ks, meaning
I know not what one of men he is. (S, TA.)
دُهْدُوهٌ, (K, [accord. to the TA دُهْدُوَهٌ, but this
is a mistake,]) or دُهْدُوهَةٌ, (IB,) The thing which
the جُعَل [or species of black beetle called cantharus] rolls, (IB, K, TA,) consisting of dung
which it collects, (IB, TA,) in a round form;
(TA;) and so دُهْدُوَّةٌ and دُهْدِيَّةٌ, [the last of
these, for alleviation of the utterance,] also without teshdeed. (IAar, K.)
دُهَيْدِهَانٌ: see دَهْدَهَةٌ.
دُهَيْدِهِينَ: see دَهْدَاهٌ.
