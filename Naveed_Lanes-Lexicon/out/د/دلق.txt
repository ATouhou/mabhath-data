إِسْتَدْلَقَ see 1, in two places.
دَلَقٌ, a Persian word (S, Msb) arabicized, (S,
Msb, K,) originally دَلَهٌ; (Msb, K;) [A species
of weasel; accord. to some, app., the common
weasel;] a certain small beast (دُوَيْبَّةٌ, S, Msb, K)
like the سَمُّور [or sable], (K,) or like the cat,
having a long back, [of the coat] of which are
made fur garments: some say that it is the [animal
called] اِبْن مِقْرَض [q. v.; and this is agreeable
with the description of Kzw, who says that it is
“ a certain wild animal, an enemy to pigeons,
likened to the cat, which, when it enters a pigeonhouse, leaves not in it anything, and abundant in
Egypt; ” a description altogether applicable to
the common weasel, now generally called اِبْن
نِمْس]: some say that it resembles the عِرْس [or
ichneumon]: some, that it is the Greek ichneumon (نِمْس رُومِىّ): (Msb in the present art.:)
accord. to IF, the [common] نِمْس. (Msb in art.
نمس.) ―
-b2-  [Also, from the same Persian original,
in post-classical times, but variously pronounced
by moderns, دَلَقٌ and ↓ دَلِقٌ and دَلْقٌ and (now
generally by the vulgar) دِلْقٌ; the third being
perhaps a contraction of the first, like as شَعْرٌ is
of شَعَرٌ, or, as also the fourth, of the second, like
as كَتْفٌ and كِتْفٌ are contractions of كَتِفٌ;
A certain kind of garment; first probably applied
to one made of the fur of the animal so called:
then applied to a kind of garment formerly worn
by the kádees and other 'ulamà and the khateebs
of mosques, (see De Sacy's Chrest. Ar., 2nd ed.,
vol. ii. pp. 267-269,) and by other persons of
religious orders: and lastly, to a kind of patched
garment worn by many devotees, reputed saints,
and darweeshes; also called مُرَقَّعَةٌ (q. v.) and
خِرْقَةٌ. It occurs in a piece of post-classical poetry,
quoted in p. 45 of the Arabic text of the vol. of
the Chrest. above referred to, necessarily with the
ل quiescent; probably by poetic license, or in
conformity with the common vulgar pronunciation.]

دَلْقَآءُ: see دَلُوقٌ, in four places.
دِلْقَمٌ: see what next follows, in three places.
دَلُوقٌ A sword that comes forth easily from its
scabbard; as also ↓ دَالِقٌ (S, K) and ↓ دَلِقٌ
(IDrd, K) and ↓ دَلْقَآءُ: (K:) [which last is strange,
and requires consideration; being fem., whereas
سَيْفٌ (a sword) is masc.:] all, applied to a sword,
signify that comes forth from its scabbard without being drawn; and that which does so is the
best of swords. (TA.) [For the pl., see what
follows.] ―

and خَيْلٌ دُلُقٌ and ↓ مُنْدَلِقَةٌ, (S,) [Horsemen

the same signification. (TA.)
-A2-  Also, and ↓ دَلْقَآءُ
and ↓ دِلْقِمٌ, with an augmentative م, (S, K,) like
as one says دَقْعَآءُ and دِقْعِمٌ, and دَرْدَآءُ and دِرْدِمٌ,
(S,) and ↓ دِلْقَمٌ, (TA,) A she-camel having her
teeth broken by old age (S, K) so that she spirts
out water [after drinking]. (S, TA.) A poet,
cited by Yaakoob, says,
لَا سِنَّ لَهَا ↓ شَارِفٌ دَلْقَآءُ
تَحْمِلُ الأَعْبَآءَ مِنْ عَهْدِ إِرَمْ
[Old and decrepit, having her teeth broken by old
age so that water falls from her mouth when she
drinks, having no tooth left, carrying burdens
from the time of Irem, i. e. Aram the son of Shem
the son of Noah]: and ↓ شَارِفٌ دَلْقَآءُ occurs in a
trad. as meaning having the teeth broken so that
water falls from her mouth when she drinks:
(TA:) [but] AZ says that one applies to the she-camel, after what is termed بُزُولٌ, the epithet
شَارِفٌ; then, عَوْزَمْ; then, لِطْلِطٌ then, جَحْمَرِشٌ;
then, جَعْمَآءُ; and then, ↓دِلْقِمٌ, when having her
teeth (أَضْرَاس) fallen out by reason of extreme old
age. (S, TA.) [See also art. دلقم.]
