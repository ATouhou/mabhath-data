دهدردُهْدُرٌّ a noun signifying What is false, or vain;
a lie; syn. بَاطِلٌ and كَذِبٌ: as also دُهْدُرَّيْنِ,
(K,) its dual, (TA,) or دُهْ دُرَّيْنِ, or دُهْ دُرَّيْنْ: (as
in different copies of the S:) whence دُهْدُرَّيْنِ
and ↓ دُهْدُرِّيَّةٌ are epithets applied to a liar; or a
great or habitual liar: and accord. to AZ, the
Arabs used to say, دُهْدُرَّانِ لَا يُغْنِياَنِ عَنْكَ شَيْئًا
[Lies will not avail thee aught]: and دُهْدُنٌّ signifies the same as دُهْدُرٌّ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  دُهْدُرَّيْنِ is also
a noun, (K,) i. e. a verbal noun, (TA,) signifying He was, or has become, unoccupied, or without work; syn. بَطَلَ; (K;) like سَرْعَانَ for سَرُعَ,
and هَيْهَاتِ for بَعُدَ. (TA.) Hence the prov.,
(TA,) دُهْدُرَّيْنِ سَعْدُ القَيْنِ, (As, K,) without the
conjunction وَ [after the first word], and دهدرّين
being written as one word, (TA,) meaning Saad
the blacksmith became, or has become, unoccupied, or without work; not being employed
because of the people's being diverted from other
things by drought (As, K) and distress. (TA.)
Some say سَاعدُ القَيْنِ: and Aboo-'Obeydeh
Maamar Ibn-El-Muthennà relates it thus: دهدرّين
سَعْدَ القَيْن, with سعد in the accus. case, and says
that دهدرّين is governed in the accus. case by a
verb understood; apparently meaning that it is a
noun signifying البَاطِلُ, dual of دُهْدُرٌّ, not a verbal
noun, as though the prov. meant Cast ye away
what is false, or vain, and Saad the blacksmith:
but what he says is not correct. (TA.) Or a
certain blacksmith asserted his name to be Saad
for some time, and then his lying became manifest; so this was said to him; meaning, Thou
hast added falsehood to falsehood, O Saad the
blacksmith. (K.) It is also related separately;
(K;) and so J and others relate it; saying ده
درّين: (TA:) [in one copy of the S, I find it
written دُهْ دُرَّيْنْ: in another, دُهْ دُرَّيْنِ:] دُهْ being
an imperative from الدَّهَآءُ; its final radical letter
being transposed to the place of the medial, so
that it becomes دُوْهْ, and the و being then rejected
because of the two quiescent letters, (K,) so
that it becomes دُهْ, like as is done in the case of
قُلْ: (TA:) and دُرَّيْنِ being from دَرَّ, “it was
consecutive; ” (K;) by the dual form being
meant repetition, as in the case of لَبَّيْكَ &c.:
(TA:) so that the meaning is Be thou very
lying (K) and cunning, (TA,) O Saad (K) the
blacksmith: (TA:) and this explanation, says
IB, is good, except inasmuch as that the د in
درّين thus derived should be with fet-h; or, he
adds, it may be with damm to assimilate it to the
د in دُهْ [like as القَيْنِ is terminated with kesr to
assimilate it to دُرَّيْنِ]. (TA.) Or the origin of
the saying was this: Saad the blacksmith was a
Persian, who went about the districts of ElYemen, working for the people; and when he
became without work in a district, he used to
say, in Persian, دِهْ بَدْرُودْ: [so in a copy of the
S; and this, or دِهْ بِدْرُودْ, is the correct reading:
in another copy of the S, دَهْ بَدُورُدْ: and in the
copies of the K, دِهْ بَدْرُودْ:] (S, K:*) meaning,
[O town, or village,] farewell: to acquaint them
that he was going forth on the morrow: (K:)
or meaning I am going forth to-morrow: (S:)
in order that he might be employed: and they
arabicized the expression, and made him the
subject of a prov. with respect to lying; and said,
When ye hear of the blacksmith's departure at
night, he is assuredly coming in the morning.
(S, K.) Some say that the prov. is elliptical, for
بَطَلَ قَوْلُ سَعْدٍ الخ [False is the saying of Saad
&c.]. (TA.) [This is mentioned in the S in
art. در.]
دُهْدُرَّيَّةٌ: see above, first sentence.
