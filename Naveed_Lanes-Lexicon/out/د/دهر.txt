دهر1
دَهَرَهُمْ أَمْرٌ, (JK, A, K,) and دَهَرَ بِهِمْ أَمْرٌ, (S,
TA,) aor.
دَهَرَ, (K,) An event befell them (S, A)
from fate, or fortune: (A:) or an evil event
befell them. (JK, K.) In a trad. respecting the
death of Aboo-Tálib occur these words [as said
by him]: لَوْ لَا أَنًّ قُرَيْشًا تَقُولُ دَهَرَهُ الجَزَعُ لَفَعَلْتُ
[Were it not that the tribe of Kureysh would say,
Impatience hath befallen him, (or, perhaps, constrained him, from دَهْرٌ signifying “fate,” or
overcome him, see what follows,) I would do
it]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  دَهَرَهُ, (Bd in xlv. 23,) inf. n. دَهْرٌ,
(K,) He overcame, conquered, subdued, overpowered, or mastered, him; gained the mastery,
prevailed, or predominated, over him; or surpassed him. (Bd ubi suprà, B, * K.)

عَامَلَهُ مُدَاهَرَةٌ and
دِهَارًا is like مُشَاهَرَةً [i. e. it
means He made an engagement, or a contract, or
bargain, with him to work, or the like, for a long
period, or for a constancy; like as مُشَاهَرَةً means
“for a month”]. (K.) And in like manner one
says, اِسْتَأْجَرَهُ مُدَاهَرَةً and دِهَارًا [He hired him for
a long period, or for a constancy]. (Lh, TA.)
Q. Q. 1
دَهْوَرَهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. دَهْوَرَةٌ, (TA,)
He collected it together, and threw it into a deep
place. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  He pushed it, namely, a wall,
so that it fell. (K.) ―
-b3-  دهوراللُّقَمَ He made the
mouthfuls large, (S, A,) or round, (Az,) and
gulped them down. (Az, A.)
Q. Q. 2
تَدَهْوَرَ It (sand) poured down, and
for the most part fell. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  And hence,
He, or it, fell down, from a higher to a lower
place. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  And It (the night) for the
most part went: (Msb:) or departed, or retreated. (K, TA.)
دَهْرٌ (T, S, M, K, &c.) and ↓ دَهَرٌ, (M, K,) the
latter either a dial. var., agreeably with the
opinion of the Basrees in cases of this kind, and
therefore such cases are limited by the authority
of hearsay, or it is so written and pronounced
because of the guttural letter, and so is accordant
to a universal rule, agreeably with the opinion of
the Koofees, (ISd,) Time, from the beginning of
the world to its end; (Esh-Sháfi'ee, Az, Msb, Er-Rághib;) as also حِينٌ: (Esh-Sháfi'ee, Az:)
this is the primary signification: (Er-Rághib:)
and any long period of time; (Z, Mgh, K, Er-Rághib;) thus differing from زَمَانٌ, which will
be explained below: (Er-Rághib:) and a portion
of the longest period of time: (Az:) or دَهْرٌ signifies, (S, A,) or signifies also, (Az, Msb,) time;
or a time; or a space, or period, of time; syn.
زَمَانٌ, (Sh, Az, S, A, Mgh, Msb,) whether long or
short: (Msb:) or this is the proper signification
of زَمَانٌ, but not of دَهْرٌ: (Er-Rághib:) and (tropical:)  a
division of the year: and (tropical:)  a less period: (Az,
Msb:) Az says, I have heard more than one of
the Arabs say, أَقَمْنَا عَلَى مَآءِ كَذَا دَهْرًا [We
stayed at such a water a long time, or a time];
and هٰذَا المَرْعَى يَكْفِينَا دَهْرًا [This pasture-land
will suffice us a long time, or a time]; but one
does not say that الدَّهْرُ is four times, or four
seasons, because its application to (tropical:)  a short period
of time is tropical, and an extension of its proper
signification: (Msb:) or it signifies i. q. أَبَدٌ
[meaning a long unlimited time; or an extended
indivisible space of time; or duration without
end; time without end]; (S, Msb;) it differs
from زَمَانٌ in having no end: (Khálid Ibn-Yezeed:) or a prolonged, or lengthened, term;
syn. أَبَدٌ مَمْدُودٌ: (K, in some copies of which, in
the place of ابد, we find أَمَد:) and (tropical:)  the period,
or duration, of life; an age: (Kull p. 183:) the
present state of existence: (Msb:) and (assumed tropical:)  a thousand years: (K:) pl. [of pauc.] أَدْهُرٌ (K) and
[of mult.] دُهُورٌ: (S, A, K:) both said to be pls.
of دَهْرٌ, and no other pls. are known as those of
دَهَرٌ; the form أَدْهَارٌ not having been heard.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  You say مَضَى عَلَيْهِ دَهْرٌ and دُهُورٌ [A
long time and long times, or an age and ages, &c.,
passed over him, or it]. (A.) ―
-b3-  And كَانَ ذٰلِكَ
دَهْرَ النَّجْمِ That was in the time of God's creation
of the stars; meaning, in the beginning of time;
in ancient time. (A.) ―
-b4-  [And فِى أَوَّلِ الدَّهْرِ In
the beginning of time. (A.) ―
-b5-  [And يَبْقَى الدَّهْرَ It
remains for ever. ―
-b6-  And لَا آتِيهِ الدَّهْرَ I will not
come to him, ever. See also دَاهِرٌ.] ―
-b7-  And صَامَ
الدَّهْرَ [He fasted ever, or always]. (TA in art.
اول, &c. [See a trad. cited voce آلَ, in that
art.]) ―
-b8-  [Hence, because, in one sense, time
brings to pass events, good and evil,] الدَّهْرُ was
applied by the Arabs to Fortune; or fate: and
they used to blame and revile it: and as the
doing so was virtually blaming and reviling
God, since events are really brought to pass by
Him, Mohammad forbade their doing thus. (Az,
Mgh, TA, &c.) It is said in a trad., لَا تَسُبُّوا الدَّهْرَ
فَإِنَّ الدَّهْرَ هُوَ اللّٰهُ, (S, Mgh, TA, &c.,) or, accord.
to one reading, فَإِنَّ اللّٰهُ هُوَ الدَّهْرُ, (Az, Mgh, TA,
&c.,) in which some explain الدهر in the first
proposition as having a different meaning from
that which it has in the second, whereas others
assign to it the same meaning in both cases:
(TA:) the meaning of the trad. is, Revile ye not
[fortune, or] the Efficient of fortune; for the
Efficient of fortune is God: (Az, S, TA, &c.:)
or, accord. to the second reading, for God is the
Efficient of fortune. (TA.) Hence, (TA,) some
reckon الدَّهْرُ as one of the names of God: (K,
&c.:) but some disallow this: and some say that
it is allowable if meant to signify, as rendered
above, the Efficient of fortune. (TA, &c.) ―
-b9-
زَوْجُ دَهْرٍ A husband prepared for the accidents or
calamities of fortune. (S in art. بهر. [See بَهْرٌ.])
―
-b10-  دَهْرٌ also signifies An evil event or accident;
a misfortune; a calamity. (K.) See also دَهَارِيرُ.
[And see 1.] ―
-b11-  Also A purpose; an intention:
(S, K:) a desire: (TA:) the scope, or end that
one has in view. (K, TA.) You say, مَا دَهْرِى
بِكَذَا, (S, TA,) and مَا دَهْرِى كَذَا, (TA,) My purpose, or intention, (S, TA,) and my desire, and my
scope, or the end that I have in view, (TA,) is
not such a thing. (S, TA.) ―
-b12-  Also (tropical:)  A custom,
or habit, (S, K,) that is constant, or permanent,
(Kull p. 183,) or that lasts throughout life.
(TA.) You say, مَا ذَاكَ بِدَهْرِى (tropical:)  That is not my
custom, or habit, (S,) that lasts throughout my
life: (TA:) and مَا دَهْرِى بِكَذَا (tropical:)  My habit
throughout life is not so. (TA.)
دَهَرٌ: see دَهْرٌ.
دَهْرِىٌّ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ دُهْرِىٌّ (K) One
who deviates from the truth, and introduces into
it that which does not belong to it, syn. مُلْحِدٌ;
(S, A;) who asserts that the duration of the
present world is from eternity, (A, Msb,) or that
it is everlasting, (K,) and does not believe in the
resurrection, (Msb,) or in the world to come.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And the latter, (S, A, Msb, K,) or the
former, (IAmb,) An old, or aged, man. (IAmb,
S, A, Msb, K.) Th says that both are rel. ns.
from الدَّهْرُ, though the latter is contr. to rule, [as
is also remarked in the Msb,] like سُهْلِىٌّ from
الأَرْضُ السَّهْلَةُ. (S.) ―
-b3-  Some say also that the
latter signifies An acute, or ingenious, or expert,
man. (TA.)
دُهْرِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.
دِهْرَارٌ: see دَهَارِيرُ.
دُهرُورٌ: see دَهَارِيرُ.
دِهْرِيرٌ: see دَهَارِيرُ.
دَهيِرٌ: see دَاهِرٌ.
دَهَارِيرُ, a pl. without a sing.; (K, TA;) or its
sing. is ↓ دَهْرٌ, like as the sing. of مَذَاكِيرُ is ذَكَرٌ,
and that of مَشَابِهُ, شَبَهٌ; or its sing. is ↓ دُهْرُورٌ, or
↓ دِهْرَارٌ, [in the TA written by mistake دهرات,]
or ↓ دِهْرِيرٌ; (TA;) Misfortunes; calamities: as
in the phrase وَقَعَ فِى الدَّهَارِيرِ He fell into misfortunes, or calamities. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also Severe,
or calamitous. (S.) It is said in a trad. of Sateeh,
فَإِنَّ ذَا الدَّهْرَ أَطْوَارًا دَهَارِيرُ
[For verily this age is at times calamitous].
(TA.) دَهْرٌ دَهَارِيرُ, A severe, or calamitous, age,
is a phrase like لَيْلَةُ لَيْلَآءُ, and نَهَارٌ أَنْهَرُ, &c.: (S:)
[see also دَاهِرٌ:] and it also signifies a time of
two states, adverse and prosperous: (TA:) and
دُهُورٌ دَهَارِيرٌ, various, or varying, times: (K:) or
long times. (A.) [See دَاهِرٌ.] ―
-b3-  Also دَهَارِيرُ [or
rather, as IbrD says, دَهْرُ الدَّهَارِيرِ, for this has the
signification immediately following,] The beginning of time past: and [absolutely] preceding,
or past, time. (K, TA.) You say كَانَ ذٰلِكَ فِى
دَهْرِ الدَّهَارِيرِ [That was in the beginning of past
time: or in the time of by-gone ages]. (TA.)
دَهْرٌ دَاهِرٌ (S, K) and ↓ دَهْرٌ دَهِيرٌ (K) are phrases
in which the epithet has an intensive effect,
[meaning A long, or an endless, period, or course,
of time,] (K,) like أَبَدٌ أَبِيدٌ (S, TA) and أَبَدٌ آبِدٌ:
(TA:) or a severe, or calamitous, age. (TA.)
[See also دَهَارِيرُ.] ―
-b2-  لَا آتِيكَ دَهْرَ الدَّهِرِينَ I will
not come to thee, ever: (S, K:) similar to the
phrase أَبَدَ الآبِدِينَ. (TA.)
هُمْ مَدْهُورٌ بِهِمٌ, and مَدْهُورُونَ, They are afflicted
with an evil event. (K.)
