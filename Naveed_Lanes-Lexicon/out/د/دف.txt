and ↓ ادفّ; (Ibn-' Abbád, M, Msb, K;) said of a
bird, (Lth, T, S, &c.,) It beat its sides (دَفَّيْهِ, i. e.,
Msb, جَنْبَيْهِ, M, Msb) with its wings: (M, Msb:)
this is what is meant by the following explanation: (Msb:) it moved [or flapped] its wings
(Msb, K) for its flight, (Msb,) as the pigeon (K)
and the like: (TA:) and it went [or flew] along
a little above the ground: (S, K:) or it moved
[or flapped] its wings, with its feet upon the
ground, (Lth, T, M, K,) flying, and then rose;
(Lth, T;) and in like manner ↓ دَفْدَفَ and
↓ استدفّ: (K:) [or] دفّ and ↓ ادفّ signify also
it (a bird) went along quickly, with its feet upon
the ground, and then raised itself flying. (Msb.)
It is said in a trad., يُؤْكَلُ مَا دَفَّ وَلَا ُؤْكَلُ مَا
صَفَّ, (K, * TA,) i. e. What moves [or flaps] its
wings [in flying], as the pigeon (K, TA) and the
like, (TA,) may be eaten; but [what skims along
without flapping,] such as vultures (K, TA) and
hawks and the like, (TA,) may not be eaten.

Pleiades]; saying,

فَلَا هُوَ مَسْبُوقٌ وَلَا هُوَ يَلْحَقُ
[Their Debarán goes along gently near after
them, so that it is not outstripped, nor does it
overtake]. (M.) [And ↓ تَدَافَّ, accord. to ISd,
seems to signify nearly the same: for it is immediately added in the M,] in the saying,
إِلَيْكَ أَشْكُو مَشْيَهَا تَدَافِيَا
مَشْىَ العَجُوزِ تَنْقُلُ الأَثَافِيَا
[app. complaining, to God, of the slowness of his
she-camel, as though meaning To Thee I complain of her pressing on slowly and laboriously,
like the gait of the old woman removing the three
stones for the support of the cooking-pot], the
poet means تَدَافُفًا. (M. [But I rather think that
the meaning here intended is, going along with
an inclining from side to side; perhaps from
دَفٌّ signifying the “ side. ” See also 6 in art.
