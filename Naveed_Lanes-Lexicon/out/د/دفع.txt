دَفَعَهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.
دَفَعَ, (K,) inf. n. دَفْعٌ
(Msb, K) and دَفَاعٌ (TA) and مَدْفَعٌ, (K,) [He
impelled it, pushed it, thrust it, or drove it; and
particularly, so as to remove it from its place;
he propelled it; he repelled, or repulsed, it; he
pushed it, thrust it, or drove it, away, or back;]
he put it away, or removed it from its place,
(Msb, TA,) by, or with, force, or strength: (TA:)
or دَفْعٌ signifies the putting away or removing or
turning back a thing before the coming or arriving [of that thing]; like as رَفْعٌ signifies the
“ putting away or removing or turning back ”
a thing “ after the coming or arriving ” thereof.
(Kull p. 185.) Hence the saying in the Kur
[ii. 252, and xxii. 41], وَلَوْ لَا دَفْعُ اللّٰهِ النَّاسَ [And
were it not for God's repelling men]; where
some read ↓ دِفَاعُ [which means the same, as will
be seen in the course of what follows, though
bearing also another interpretation, likewise to be
seen in what follows]. (TA.) You say, دَفَعْتُ
الرَّجُلَ [I impelled, pushed, &c., the man]. (S.)
And ↓ دافعهُ, inf. n. دِفَاعٌ [and مُدَافَعَةٌ]; and
↓ دفّعهُ; (TA;) [both, app., accord. to the TA,
signifying the same; but the latter more properly relates to several objects together, or signifies he impelled it, pushed it, &c., much, or
vehemently, or often; whereas] مُدَافَعَةٌ (K, TA)
and دِفَاعٌ (TA) are [often exactly] syn. with دَفْعٌ.
(K, TA.) Thus, (TA,) you say, as meaning the
same, عَنْهُ ↓ دافع and دَفَعَ [He repelled from him;
whence another explanation of these two phrases,
which see in what follows]. (S, TA.) And hence,
دَفَعَ اللّٰهُ عَنْكَ المَكْرُوهَ, inf. n. دَفْعٌ, (tropical:)  [May God
repel, or avert, from thee what is disliked, or
hated, or evil]: (TA:) and اللّٰهُ عَنْكَ السُّوْءَ ↓ دَافَعَ,
inf. n. دِفَاعٌ, (tropical:)  [May God repel, or avert, from
thee evil]. (S, TA.) And دَفَعْتُ عَنْهُ الأَذَى (tropical:)  [I
repelled, or averted, from him what was hurtful,
or annoying; as also ↓ دَافَعْتُ]. (Msb, K, TA.)
Sb mentions, as a saying of the Arabs, اِدْفَعِ الشَّرَّ
وَلَوْ إِصْبَعًا (tropical:)  [Repel thou, or avert thou, evil, or
mischief, though but with a finger: the last word
being in the accus. case by reason of the subaudition of the prep. ب; the meaning being بِإِصْبَعٍ].
(TA.) [See also an ex. voce دَفُوعٌ.] When
دَفْعٌ is made trans. by means of عَنْ, [and has
a single objective complement, a second objective complement is understood, and in general] it
has the meaning or the act of (assumed tropical:)  Defending; as in
the Kur [xxii. 39], إِنَّ اللّٰهَ يَدْفَعُ عَنْ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا
(assumed tropical:)  [Verily God defendeth those who have believed;
i. e. repelleth from them aggression and the like];
(B;) and ↓ يُدَافِعُ, in the same, (K, TA,) accord.
to another reading, signifies the same; (K, TA;)
or this latter signifies (assumed tropical:)  defendeth energetically,
with the energy of him who contendeth for superiority in so doing. (Bd.) And عَنْهُ ↓ دَافَعْتُ signifies [also] (assumed tropical:)  I pleaded, or contended in arguments, in defence of him. (Msb.) [Exceptions
to the statement cited above form the B will be
found in what follows in this paragraph; and
another exception, voce مُدَفَّعٌ.] ―
-b2-  [In the exs.
which follow, the verb is used in senses little
differing, essentially, from those assigned to it in
the first sentence of this art.] ―
-b3-  دَفَعْتُ مِنَ الإِنَآءِ
دَفَْعَةً [I poured forth from the vessel a single
pouring]: the last word, which is with fet-h, is
an inf. n. [of un.]. (Msb.) ―
-b4-  دَفَعَتِ اللِّبَأَفِى
ضَرْعِهَا قُبَيْلَ النِّتَاجِ (tropical:)  [She (a ewe, or goat, S, or a
camel, S, K) infused the first milk into her
udder, i. e. secreted it therein, a little before
bringing forth]. (S, K.) And دَفَعَتِ اللَّبَنِ عَلَى
رَأْسِ وَلَدِهَا لِكَثْرَتِهِ (tropical:)  [She (a ewe or goat, or a
camel, TA) secreted the milk in her udder when
about to produce her young, by reason of its
abundance]; for the milk becomes abundant in
her udder only when she is about to bring forth:
the inf. n. [app. the inf. n. of un.] is دَفْعَةٌ. (TA.)
And دَفَعَتْ alone, said of a ewe or goat, signifies
(assumed tropical:) She secreted milk in her udder when about to
produce the young; expl. by أَضْرَعَتْ عَلَى رَأْسِ
الوَلَدِ [which see in art. ضرع]. (S, TA.) Accord.
to En-Nadr, one says دَفَعَتْ بِلَبِنِهَا, and بِاللَّبَنِ,
when her young is in her belly; but when she
has brought forth, one does not say دَفَعَتْ. (TA.)
―
-b5-  In the saying, غَشِيِتْنَا سَحَابَةٌ فَدَفَعْنَاهَا إِلَى غَيْرِنَا
[lit. A cloud overspread us, and we drove it away
to other persons], meaning (tropical:)  it departed from us
to other persons, دفعناها is for دَفَعَتْنَا, which
means دُفِعَتْ عَنَّا [lit. it was driven away from
us]. (TA.) ―
-b6-  دَفَعَهُ بِحُجَّةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [He refelled him,
or refuted him, by an argument or the like].
(MF in art. كفح.) ―

thou this, sparing him. (As, TA.) [See مُدَفَّعٌ.]
―
-b9-  [In several exs. here following, the verb
resembles اندفع; نَفْسَهُ, or the like, being understood after it.] ―
-b10-  دَفَعَ المَآءُ [The water poured
out, or forth, as though it impelled, or propelled,
itself]: (TA: [where it is followed by وَانْصَبَّ,
as an explicative adjunct:]) and so السَّيْلُ [the
torrent]. (ISh.) [See also 6.] And دَفَعَ الوَادِى
بِالمَآءِ [The valley poured with water]. (TA in
art. حشك.) ―
-b11-  دَفَعَ فِى عَدْوِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He pushed, or

pass. form, (Msb,) (tropical:)  He reached, or came to, the
place. (Msb, TA.) You say also, هٰذَا طَرِيقٌ يَدْفَعُ

such a place. (TA.) ―
-b14-  دَفَعَ مِنْ عَرَفَاتٍ (assumed tropical:)  He

went away, or journeyed, from the place. (Msb.)
[See again 7.] ―
-b15-  دَفَعَ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He returned.
(MF.) ―
-b16-  When دَفْعٌ is made trans. by means
of إِلَى, it [generally, but not always, as has been
shown above,] has the meaning of the act of
Giving, or delivering; as in the Kur [iv. 5],
فَادْفَعُوا إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ [Then give ye, or deliver ye,
to them their property]. (B.) You say, دَفَعْتُ
إِلَىى فُلَانٍ شَيْئًا [I gave, or delivered, to such a one a
thing]. (S, K. *) And دَفَعْتُ الوَدِيعَةَ إِلَى صَاحِبِهَا I
restored the deposit to its owner. (Msb.) And
دَفَعْتُ لَهُ قِطْعَةً مِنَ المَالِ [I gave him a part, or
portion, of the property]. (S in art. زعب; and
the like is said in that art. in the K.) And دَفَعَهُ
[alone] He gave it; syn. أَعْطَاهُ. (Er-Rághib,
MF.)

-b2-  دفّعهُ إِلَى كَذَا
(tropical:)  He drove him, compelled him, or necessitated him,
to do, or to have recourse to, such a thing. (TA.)

3

him, or repel him; or the pushing, or repelling,

7
اندفع is quasi-pass. of دَفَعَهُ; (S, K, TA;)
and ↓ تدفّع is quasi-pass. of دفّعهُ; and ↓ تدافع is
quasi-pass. of دافعهُ: but all three are used in the

primarily signifies He, or it, became impelled,
pushed, thrust, or driven; and particularly, so as
to be removed from his, or its, place; became propelled; became repelled; became impelled, pushed,
thrust, or driven, away, or back, or onwards;

دِفَاعُ, determinate, as a proper name, The ewe:
