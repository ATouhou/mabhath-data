دَرْبٌ is not a word of Arabic origin: (Msb:)
الدَّرْبٌ is [the Arabic name of the ancient Derbe,
near the Cilician Gates, which were the chief
mountain-pass, from the direction of the countries
occupied by the Arabs, into the territory of the
Greek Empire: these “ Gates ” are mentioned
by El-Idreesee as fortified, and guarded by troops
who watched the persons going and coming:]
a well-known place in الرُّوم [or the territory of
the Greek Empire], mentioned by Imra-el-Keys,
[as El-Idreesee also says,] in the words,
بَكَى صَاحِبِى لَمَّا رَأَى الدَّرْبَ حَوْلَهُ
[My companion wept when he saw the درب
around him; knowing himself to be in the power
of the Greeks]. (MF, TA.) [Hence,] Any place
of entrance, (Kh, T, M, A, Mgh [in my copy of
which it is written دَرَب in all its senses], K,) or
a narrow pass, (Mgh,) to [the territory of]
الرُّوم: (Kh, T, M, A, Mgh, K:) or such as is
not open at both ends: such as is open at both
ends being called ↓ دَرَبٌ: (K:) or a place of
entrance between two mountains: (Msb:) or a
narrow pass in mountains: and hence it has
another meaning well known: (S:) [i. e.] the
gate of a سِكَّة [here meaning street: misunderstood by Golius, who has consequently explained
دَرْبٌ as having, for one of its meaning, “porta
ingressusve palmeti ”]; used in this sense by the
Arabs because it [i. e. the درب properly so called]
is like a gate, or entrance, to that whereto it
leads: (Msb:) or the gate of a wide سِكَّة: (T:)
or a wide gate of a سِكَّة; and the largest gate;
(M, K;) both of which explanations mean the
same: (M:) and also a wide سِكَّة itself: so in the
phrase, زُقَاقٌ أَوْ دَرْبٌ غَيْرُ نَافِذٍ [a narrow street or a
wide street not being a thoroughfare]: (Mgh: [in
my copy of which, دَرَبٌ is put for دَرْبٌ:]) [but in
the present day, and as used by El-Makreezee
and others, a by-street, whether wide or narrow,
branching off from a great street, or passing
through a حَارَة (or quarter), open, or having a
gate, at each end:] pl. دُرُوبٌ (Kh, T, M, Mgh,
TA) and دِرَابٌ. (Sb, K. [The former pl., the
only one commonly known, is not mentioned
in the K.]) ―
-b2-  Also A place in which dates are
put to dry. (M, K.)
دَرَبٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
دَرِبٌ [part. n. of دَرِبَ]. You say, هُوَ دَرِبٌ بِهِ
[He is accustomed, or habituated, to it; attached,
addicted, given, or devoted, to it; and bold to do
it, or undertake it: and] he knows it, has knowledge of it, or is knowing in it. (A, TA.) And
some use ↓ دَارِبٌ as part. n. of دَرِبَ: (Msb:) it
signifies Skilful in his handicraft: (IAar, T,
Msb:) and with ة, intelligent: (IAar, T, K:)
and skilful in her handicraft: (K:) and [hence]
a female drummer. (IAar, T, K.) And عُقَابٌ
↓ دَارِبٌ (M) or عُقَابٌ دَارِبٌ عَلَى الصَّيْدِ (K) means
دَرِبَةٌ (K) or دَرِبَةٌ بِالصَّيْدِ (M) [An eagle accustomed, or habituated, or trained, to the chase;
and bold to practise it].
دُرْبَةٌ Custom, or habit; (IAar, T, S, M, A, K;)
or habituation; (T, Msb;) and boldness to engage
in, or undertake, war, and any affair: (IAar,
T, S, A, * Msb, * K:) and ↓ دُرَّابَةٌ, (M, TA,) with
teshdeed, (TA,) on the authority of IAar, (M,
TA,) but written in the K ↓ دُرَابَة, (TA,) signifies the same. (M, K, TA.) One says, مَا زِلْتُ
أَعْفُو عَنْ فُلَانٍ حَتَّى اتَّخَذَهَا دُرْبَةً [I ceased not to
forgive such a one until he took it as a habit].
(T, * S.)
دَرَبُوتٌ (Lh, M, K [in the CK دَرَبُوبٌ]) and
↓ دَرُوبٌ, (K,) the former like تَرَبُوتٌ, in which the
[initial] ت is [said to be] a substitute for د, (Lh,
M,) A he-camel, (M, K,) or such as is termed
بَكْرٌ, (Lh, M,) and a she-camel, (Lh, M, K,) submissive, or tractable, (M, K,) or rendered submissive or tractable: and a she-camel that will
follow a person if he takes hold of her lip or her
eyelash. (Lh, M, K. [But I read بِهُدْبِ عَيْنِهَا, as
in the explanation of تَرَبُوتٌ in the TA, instead of
نَهَزْتَ عَيْنَهَا in the M and CK in this art., and
نَهَزَتْ عَيْنُهَا in my MS. copy of the K. See also
تَرَبُوتٌ.])

tried, or proved: syn. مُجَرَّبٌ (T, S, M, A, * K)
and مُنَجَّذٌ: (M, K:) and ↓ مُدَرِّبٌ is syn. with
مُجَرّبٌ: (S:) or in every word of the measure
مُفَعَّلٌ syn. with مُجَرَّبٌ, the medial radical letter
may be pronounced with fet-h or with kesr, except مُدَرَّبٌ. (M, K.) ―
