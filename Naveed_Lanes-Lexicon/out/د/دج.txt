دَجِيجٌ: see دَجُوجِىٌّ
دَجَاجَةٌ and دِجَاجَةٌ and دُجَاجَةٌ are explained
above, voce دَجَاجٌ.
دُجَاجِىٌّ: see دَجُوجِىٌّ, in two places.
نَاقَةٌ دَجَوْجَاةٌ: [A long-bodied she-camel; lit.]
a she-camel spreading upon, or over, the ground.

also ↓ أَسْوَدُ دُجْدُجٌ and ↓ دُجَاجِىٌّ. (K.) It has
the latter signification applied to a he-camel;
and دَجُوجِيَّةٌ to a she-camel. (S, TA.) Also
simply Black; applied to hair; and so ↓ دَجِيجٌ:
or the latter has this signification applied to anything; as also ↓ دَجْدَاجٌ: (TA:) which last likewise signifies dark, applied to a sea or great
river, (K, TA,) because of the blackness of its
water. (TA.) You say also لَيْلٌ دَجُوجِىٌّ Dark

party, or company, creeping along; i. e., going,
or walking, leisurely, softly, or gently: (ISk, S:)
or doing so with short steps: or coming and

TA) The [company of pilgrims to Mekkeh, and
of the] letters-out of camels &c., and the servants,
or assistants, (S, K,) and the like attendants of
the pilgrims, came: (TA:) the two words حاجّ
and داجّ, though sings., are used in the pl. sense:
(TA:) or الداجّ signifies also the merchants; (K;)
or the merchants and others who go leisurely, or
creep along, after the pilgrims. (TA.) الداجّ
has the same meaning in the words of a trad.,
هٰؤُلَآءِ الدَّاجُّ وَلَيْسُوا بِالجَاجِّ [These are the lettersout of camels &c., and they are not the pilgrims]:
(S, K:) said by Ibn-' Omar, of a people whom
he saw among the pilgrims, whose appearance
he disliked: or it means, accord. to A 'Obeyd,
those who are with the pilgrims, such as the
hired men, and the camel-drivers, and the servants, and the like; and Ibn-' Omar meant that
these were not pilgrims in the proper sense, but
merely persons journeying and creeping along.
(TA.) In the words of another trad., مَا تَرَكْتُ
مِنْ حَاجَةٍ وَلَا دَاجَةٍ إِلَّا أَتَيْتُ, the word داجة is
without teshdeed, and is an imitative sequent to
حاجة: (S:) [see art. دوج:] but accord. to one
relation, it is ما تركت حَاجَّةٌ وَلَا دَاجَّةٌ, meaning,
accord. to El-Khattábee, [I left not a company
of] pilgrims to Mekkeh, nor those returning.
(TA.) One says also, أَمَا وَحَوَاجِّ بَيْتِ اللّٰهِ وَ دَوَاجِّهِ
لَأَفْعَلَنَّ كَذَا وَكَذَا [Nay, by the pilgrims to the
House of God, and those who journey thither for
mercantile purposes, I will assuredly do such
and such things]. (TA.)

(S, * K, * TA:) and so A 'Obeyd explains
↓ مُدَجْدَجٌ: he is so called because he walks
slowly by reason of the weight of his arms; or
because he covers himself therewith, from دَجَّجَتِ
السَّمَآءُ. (TA.) ―
