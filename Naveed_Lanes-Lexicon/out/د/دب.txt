gourd: or dry gourd: but this is said by Ibn-
Hajar to be a mistake of En-Nawawee; and he

fruit of the يقطين: (TA:) n. un. of the former
with ة. (M, K.) Accord. to F [and ISd] and
several others, this is the proper art. of the former
word, the ء being considered by them augmentative: accord. to Z and others, its proper art. is

what is thrown upon them from above: (TA:)
it is also called ضَبْرٌ. (Mgh.)

or mischievous, and clamorous. (Az, in TA, art.
جب.) ―

دَابَّةٌ [originally a fem. part. n.], for نَفْسٌ دَابَّةٌ,
(M,) [or the ة is added لِلنَّقْلِ, i. e. for the purpose of transferring the word from the category
of epithets to that of substs.,] Anything that
walks [or creeps or crawls] upon the earth; as
also ↓ دَبِيبٌ: (S: see دِبَّةٌ:) an animal that walks
or creeps or crawls (يَدِبُّ); (M, A, K;) discriminating and not discriminating: (M:) any
animal upon the earth: (Msb:) it is said in the
Kur [xxiv. 44], وَاللّٰهُ خَلَقَ كُلَّ دَابَّةٍ مِنْ مَآءٍ فَمِنْهُمْ
مَنْ يَمْشِى عَلَى بَطْنِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَمْشِى عَلَى رِجْلَيْنِ
وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَمْشِى عَلَى أَرْبَعٍ [And God hath
created every دابّة of water (meaning of the
seminal fluid); and of them is he that goeth upon
his belly, and of them is he that goeth upon two
legs, and of them is he that goeth upon four]:
here, as دابّة applies to a rational and an irrational creature, the expression فمنهم is used; for
which, if it applied only to an irrational creature,
فَمِنْهَا or فَمِنْهُنَّ would be used: moreover, the expression من يمشى is used, though دابّة applies
originally to an irrational creature, [or rather a
beast, and a reptile,] because the different classes
of beings are spoken of collectively: (M:) and
this passage of the Kur refutes the assertion of
him who excludes the bird from the significations
of this word: (Msb:) in the last verse but one
of ch. xxxv. of the Kur, it is said to relate to
mankind and the jinn (or genii) and every rational being; or to have a general signification:
(M:) its predominant signification is a beast that
is ridden: (S, M, A, K:) especially a beast of
the equine kind; i. e. a horse, a mule, and an
ass: (Kull:) or particularly a بِرْذَوْن [meaning
hackney, or horse for ordinary use and for
journeying: (M:) but as particularly applied,
when used absolutely, to a horse and a mule, it is
an adventitious conventional term: (Msb:) it is
applied to a male and a female: (M, A, Msb,
K:) and is properly an epithet: (M:) pl. دَوَابُّ.
(Msb, TA.) The dim. [signifying Any small
animal that walks or creeps or crawls upon the
earth, a small beast, a small reptile or creeping
thing, a creeping insect, and any insect, and also
a mollusk, a shell-fish (as in an instance cited voce
مَحَارَةٌ in art. حور) and the like,] is ↓ دُوَيْبَّةٌ, (Zj,
T, Msb,) in which the ى is quiescent, but pronounced with إِشْمَام [i. e. a slight approximation
to the sound of kesr], as it is in every similar
case, in a dim. n., when followed by a doubled
letter: (Zj, T:) and ↓ دُوَابَّةٌ also has been heard,
with the ى changed into ا anomalously. (Msb;
and L in art. هد, on the authority of ISd.) ―
-b2-
دَابَّةُ الأَرْضِ [The Beast of the Earth] is an appellation of one of the signs of the time of the
resurrection: (S, M, K:) or the first of those
signs. (K.) It is said to be a beast sixty cubits
in length, or height, with legs, and with fur
(وَبَر), and to be diverse in form, resembling a
number of different animals. (TA.) It will come
forth in Tihámeh, or between Es-Safà and ElMarweh, (M,) or at Mekkeh, from Jebel Es-
Safà, which will rend open for its egress, during
one of the nights when people are going to
Minè; or from the district of Et-Táïf; (K) or
from three places, three several times. (M, K.)
It will make, upon the face of the unbeliever, a
black mark; and upon the face of the believer, a
white mark: the unbeliever's mark will spread
until his whole face becomes black; and the
believer's, until his whole face becomes white:
then they will assemble at the table, and the
believer will be known from the unbeliever.
(M.) It is also said that it will have with it the
rod of Moses and the seal of Solomon: with the
former it will strike the believer; and with the
latter it will stamp the face of the unbeliever, impressing upon it “ This is an unbeliever. ” (K.)

دُوَابَّةٌ: dims. of دَابَّةٌ, q. v.
دُوَيْبَّةٌ: dims. of دَابَّةٌ, q. v.
أَدَبٌّ Having down (K, TA) upon the face:
(TA:) or having much hair: (M, K:) and
having much وَبَر [or fur]: (M:) it is applied to
a man: (M:) and to a camel, (M, K,) in the
second of these senses, (K, TA,) or in the third
sense, or as meaning having much fur upon the
face; (TA;) or i. q. أَزَبُّ: (M:) and occurs
in a trad. written أَدْبَب, (M, K,) to assimilate it
in measure to a preceding word, namely, حَوْءَب:
(M:) the fem. is دَبَّآءُ; with which ↓ دَبِبَةٌ is syn.;
(M, K;) signifying a woman having hair upon
her face: (TA:) or having much hair upon the
جَبِين [or part above the temple]. (M, TA.)
مَدِبٌّ and مَدَبٌّ The track, or course, of a
torrent, (S, M, K, *) and of ants: (S, K:) pl.
مَدَابُّ. (TA.) One says, of a sword, لَهُ أَثْرٌ كَأَنَّهُ
مَدَبُّ النَّمْلِ and مَدَابُّ الذَّرِّ [It has diversified
wavy marks like the track of ants and the tracks
of little ants]. (TA.) The subst. is with kesr;
and the inf. n., with fet-h; accord. to a rule constantly obtaining, (S, * K, * TA,) except in some
anomalous instances, (TA,) when the verb is of the
measure فَعَلَ (S, K, TA) or فَعِلَ, (TA,) and its
aor. is of the measure يَفْعِلُ. (S, K, TA.) [Here
it should be observed that مَجْرًى, given as the
explanation of مَدِبٌّ and مَدَبٌّ in the K, is both
an inf. n. and a n. of place and of time: but J
clearly explains both these words as above; and
F seems, in the K, to assign to them both the
same signification.]
أَرْضٌ مَدَبَّةٌ A land abounding with دِبَبَة [or
bears]. (T, S, M. *)
مُدَبَّبٌ, like مُعَظَّمٌ, (TA,) or مِدْبَبٌ, (so in a
copy of the T, according to the TT,) an epithet applied to a camel, (T, TA,) signifying الذى يمشى
دبادب (TA) [app. دَبَادِبَ, and if so it seems to mean
That walks quickly, with short steps: or that makes
a sound with his feet, like دُبْ دُبْ: see دَبْدَبَةٌ:
but in the TT it is written دَباْ دَباْ; perhaps correctly دَبًّا دَبًّا, creeping and creeping].
