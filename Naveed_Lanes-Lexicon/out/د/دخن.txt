(assumed tropical:)  upon latent rancour or malevolence: (S and
TA in art. هدن:) but A'Obeyd, in explaining a
trad. in which it occurs, takes it from دَخَنٌ as
signifying “ a duskiness, or dinginess, inclining

of it]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  It also means (assumed tropical:)  Dearth, drought,
sterility, or unfruitfulness; and hunger: and so
it has been said to mean in the Kur xliv. 9: for
it is said that the hungry [once] saw smoke
(دُخَان) between him and the sky: or hunger is
thus called because of the dryness of the earth in
drought, and the rising of the dust, which is
likened to دُخَان [properly so termed]. (TA.) ―
