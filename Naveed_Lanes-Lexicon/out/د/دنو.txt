دنو1
دَنَا, (T, M, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,) first pers.
دَنَوْتُ, (T, S,) aor. يَدْنُو, (T, Msb,) inf. n. دُنُوٌّ
(T, S, M, Msb, K) and دَنَاوَةٌ, (M, K,) He, or it,
was, or became, near; drew near, or approached;
(T, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also ↓ ادنى; (IAar,
T, K;) and ↓ دنّى, inf. n. تَدْنِيَةٌ; (IAar, T;) and
↓ دانى, inf. n. مُدَانَاةٌ; (KL, but only the inf. n.
is there mentioned;) and ↓ اِدَّنَى, inf. n. اِدِّنَآءٌ:
(TA:) it is either in person, or substance, or in
respect of predicament, and in place, and in
time: (El-Harállee, TA:) you say, دَنَا مِنْهُ, (M,
Mgh, Msb,) and دَنَوْتُ مِنْهُ, (T, S,) and إِلَيْهِ, (M,
Msb,) and لَهُ, (TA,) and عَلَيْهِ occurs in a verse of
Sá'ideh as meaning مِنْهُ, (M,) He, or it, and I,
was, or became, near, &c., to him, or it: (T, M,
Mgh, Msb:) [and in like manner you use the
other verbs mentioned above, except ↓ دانى,
which is immediately trans.: or دَنَا مِنْهُ with
دَنَاوَةٌ for its inf. n. means, or means also, He was
near to him in respect of kindred; was related to
him: for] دَنَاوَةٌ is syn. with قَرَابَةٌ (S, M, K) and
قُرْبَى: (M, K:) you say, بَيْنَهُمَا دَنَاوَةٌ meaning
قَرَابَةٌ [i. e. Between them two is relationship];
(S;) and مَا تَزْدَادُ مِنَّا إِلَّا قُرْبًا وَدَنَاوَةٍ [Thou increasest not save in nearness and relationship to
us]. (ISk, T, S.) A rájiz says,
مَا لِى أَرَاهُ دَالِفًا قَدْدُنْىَ لَهُ
meaning دُنِىَ لَهُ [i. e. What hath happened to me
that I see him walking gently or with short steps,
or rendered lowly by age, having been approached
by death?]: it is from دَنَوْتُ, but the و is changed
into ى because of the kesreh before it, and then
the ن is made quiescent: and there are similar
instances of contraction of verbs: but [ISd says,]
I know not دُنْىَ except in this instance; and As
used to say of the poem in which this occurs,
This rejez is not ancient: it is app. of Khalaf ElAhmar or some other of the Muwelleds. (M.)
One says also, دَنَتِ الشَّمْسُ لِلْمَغُرُوبِ and ↓ أَدْنَت
[The sun was, or became, near to setting]. (M.)
-A2-  دَنِىَ, (T, M, K, TA, [in the CK, ما كانَ دَنْيَا
ولقد دَنا is erroneously put for مَا كَانَ دَنِيًا وَلَقَدْ
دَنِىَ,]) like رَضِىَ, (TA,) aor. يَدْنَى, (T,) inf. n.
دَنًا (T, M, K) and دَنَايَةٌ, (T, K, TA,) or دِنَايَةٌ;
(M, accord. to the TT; and so in the CK; [app.
a mistranscription occasioned by a misunderstanding of what here follows;]) the ى [in دَنِىَ]
being substituted for و because of the nearness of
the kesreh; all on the authority of Lh; (M;) and
دَنُوَ, aor. يَدْنُو, without ء, inf. n. دَنَآءَةٌ, with ء,
(ISk, T,) and دُنُوٌّ; (T;) or دَنَا, aor. يَدْنُو, inf. n.
دَنَاوَةٌ; i. q. دَنَأَ and دَنُؤَ; (Msb;) [i. e.] He (a man,
T, M) was, or became, such as is termed ↓ دَنِىٌّ;
(T, M, Msb, K;) and دَنِىْءٌ; (Msb;) meaning
weak; contemptible (خَسِيسٌ); not profitable to
any one; who falls short in everything upon
which he enters: (T: [like مُدَنٍّ:]) or low,
ignoble, or mean; (سَاقِطٌ;) weak; (M, K;) such
as, when night affords him covert, will not quit
his place, by reason of weakness: (M:) or low,
ignoble, or mean, (لَئِيمٌ,) in his actions, or conduct; bad, evil, or foul; accord. to the explanation of دَنَا by Es-Sarakustee: but some distinguish
between دَنِىْءٌ and دَنِىٌّ; making the former to
signify “ low, ignoble, or mean; ” (لَئِيمٌ;) and the
latter, خَسِيسٌ [app. as meaning contemptible].
(Msb, and so the latter is explained in the Mgh.)

سَمُّوا وَ سَمِّتُواوَ دَنُّوا, i.e. [Pronounce ye the name
of God, (i. e. say, In the name of God,) and
invoke a blessing upon him at whose abode or

And in another trad., إِذَا أَكَلْتُمْ فَسَمُّوا اللّٰهَ وَدَنُّوا,

and] eat of that which is near you: (M:) or

قَيْنَيْهِ وَانْحَسَرَتْ عَنْهُ الأَنَاعِيمُ
[The shackles, or hobbles, straitened to him, in a

down her garment upon her, and covered, or
veiled, herself with it. (Mgh.) And أَدْنَيْتُ السِّتْرَ

[xxxiii. 59], يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنّ مِنْ جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ [They
shall let down upon them a portion of their outer
wrapping-garments]; (Mgh;) meaning they shall

their needful purposes, except one eye. (Jel.)
-A2-

-b2-
[Hence,] أَدْنَتْ, said of a she-camel, (S, TA,) and
of a woman, (TA,) She was, or became, near to
bringing forth. (S, TA.) And أَدْنَتْ عَلَى رَأْسِ
الوَلَدِ [a phrase similar to أَضْرَعَتْ عَلَى رَأْسِ الوَلَدِ,
q. v.]. (Occurring in a verse cited in the TA in

8
اِدَّنَى, inf. n. اِدِّنَآءٌ: see 1.
10
استدناهُ He sought, desired, or demanded,
of him, nearness, or approach; (M, K, TA;)
he sought, or desired, to make him draw near, or
approach: and he drew him near, or caused him
to approach. (MA. [See also 4.])
دَنًا inf. n. of دَنِىَ, q. v. (T, M, K.)
-A2-  أَدْنَى دَنًا:
see ادنى.
هُوَ ابْنُ عَمّ دِنْىٍ and دِنْيًا and دِنْيَا and ↓ دُنْيَا
mean [He is a son of a paternal uncle] closely
related; syn. لَحًّا [q. v.]: when you pronounce
the د with damm, you do not make the word
perfectly decl.: when you pronounce it with
kesr, you make it either perfectly or imperfectly
decl.: but when you prefix عَمّ to a determinate
noun, دِنْى may not be in the gen. case: for instance, you say, هُوَ ابْنُ عَمِّهِ دِنْيًا, i. e. [He is the
son of his paternal uncle] closely related; as also
↓ دِنْيَةٌ; because دِنْى, being indeterminate, cannot
be an epithet applied to that which is determinate:
(S:) and [in like manner] you say, هُوَ ابْنُ عَمِّى,
or ابن خَالِى, or ابن عَمَّتِى, or ابن خَالَتِى, or
ابن أَخِى, or ابن أُخْتِى, (M, K,) all mentioned
by Lh, the last two as on the authority of Aboo-
Safwán, but all except the first and second as
unknown to Ks and to As, (M,) followed by
↓ دِنْيَةٌ and دِنْيًا and دِنْيَا and ↓ دُنْيَا, (M, K, TA,)
the last two without tenween, (TA; [and so
written in the M; but in the CK and my MS.
copy of the K, in the place of these two is put
دُنْيًا, which is disallowed by J;]) meaning [He is
the son of my paternal uncle, and the son of my
maternal uncle, &c.,] closely related: (M, K:)
and ↓ هُوَ عَمُّهُ دُنٌيَا and ↓ دِنْيَةً and دِنْيًا and دِنْيَا
[He is his paternal uncle closely related]: (Ks,
T:) Lh says that the و is changed into ى in
↓ دِنْيَةً and دِنٌيًا because of the nearness of the
kesreh and the weakness of the intervening letter,
as is the case in فِتْيَةٌ and عِلْيَةٌ: but it seems that
these words are originally ↓ دُنْيَا, i. e., by a relationship, or uterine relationship, nearer to me
than others; and that the change of the letter is
made only to show that the ى is that of the fem.
of أَدْنَى. (M.) You say also, ↓ هُمْ رَهْطُهُ دِنْيَةً
They are his people, and his tribe, closely related.
(S and TA in art. رهط.)
دِنْيَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in five
places.
دُنْيَا fem. of أَدْنَى [q. v.].
دُنْيِىٌّ: see what next follows.
دُنْيَوِىٌّ: see what next follows.
دُنْيَاوِىٌّ [Of, or relating to, the present world,
or state of existence; worldly:] a rel. n. from
الدُّنْيَا; (T, S;) as also ↓ دُنٌيَوِىٌّ and ↓ دُنْيِىٌّ. (S.)
دَنِىٌّ i. q. قَرِيبٌ [as meaning Near, in person,
or substance, or in respect of predicament, and in
place, and in time: (see 1, first sentence: and see
also دَانٍ:) and a relation]: (T, S:) and a friend;
or a sincere, or secret, or particular, friend; syn.
خُلْصَانٌ. (T.) It has these significations (of
قريب and خلصان) in the prov. كُلُّ دَنِىٍّ دُوَنهُ دَنِىٌّ
[app. meaning There is a relation, or a friend,
nearer than every other relation, or friend; like
another prov., namely, دُونَ كُلِّ قُرَيْبَى قُرْبَى, for
the meaning and application of which see art.
قرب: Freytag renders it, “Quod attinet ad
quemlibet propinquum (amicum), præter eum est
propinquus:” (Arab. Prov. ii. 357:) and he adds,
“ Proverbii sensus esse videtur: Quilibet propinquus seu amicus unicus non est; sed præter
eum est alius ”]: (T, Meyd:) so says AZ.
(Meyd.) ―
-b2-  See also أَدْنَى.
-A2-  As an epithet applied to a man, signifying Weak; contemptible;
&c.: see 1, near the end of the paragraph: [but J
says that] as meaning دُونٌ, it is [دَنِىْءٌ,] with ء:
(S:) the pl. is أَدْنِيَآءُ. (T, M.) [In the CK, by a
mistranscription mentioned above (voce دَنِىَ),
دَنْىٌ is made to signify the same.]
دَنِيَّهٌ A low, or base, quality, property, natural
disposition, habit, practice, or action; syn. نَقِيصَةٌ;
(Mgh;) or such as is blamed; originally دَنِيْئَةٌ:
(TA:) pl. دَنَايَا. (Har p. 327.) Hence the saying
of Ibn-Háritheh, المَنِيَّةَ لَا الدَّنِيَّةَ, meaning I choose
death rather than, or not, disgrace. (Har ubi
suprà.)
دَانٍ [Being, or becoming, near; drawing near,
or approaching: and hence, near; like دَنِىٌّ:]
act. part. n. of دَنَا مِنْهُ. (Msb.)
أَدْنَى Nearer, and nearest; opposed to أَقْصَى:
(TA:) fem. دُنْيَا; (M, TA;) in which the [radical] و is changed into ى, as in عُلْيَا and قُصْيَا:
(ISd, TA voce بُقْوَى:) [the pl. of the masc. is
أَدَانٍ and أَدْنَوْنَ; the latter in the accus. and gen.
أَدْنَيْنِ: and] the pl. of the fem., دُنًى, (S, K,
TA,) like كُبَرٌ pl. of كُبْرَى, and صُغَرٌ pl. of
صُغْرَى; (S, TA;) said by some to be extr. and
strange [in respect of usage]; and El-Mutanebbee
has been blamed for using it; (MF, TA;) but
in the case referred to he has used الدُّنَى for
الدُّنْيَا, [not as a pl.,] suppressing the ى by poetic
license. (TA.) [Hence,] غُلِبَتِ الرُّومُ فِى أَدْنَى
الأَرْضِ, in the Kur xxx. 1 and 2, The Greeks
have been overcome in the nearer, or nearest, part
of the land. (Bd, Jel.) And الجَمْرَةُ الدُّنْيَا [The
nearest heap of pebbles;] the heap of pebbles
nearest to Minè. (TA. [See art. جمر.]) And
السَّمَآءُ الدُّنْيَا [The nearest heaven; i. e. the lowest;]
the heaven that is the nearest to us: (T, TA:)
also called سَمَآءُ الدُّنْيَا [which means the heaven of
the present world; as will be seen from what
follows]. (TA.) See also exs. of the fem. in the
paragraph commencing with the words هُوَ ابْنُ
عَمٍّ دِنْىٍ, in four places. ―
-b2-  Also Former, and
first; and fore, and foremost; opposed to آخِرٌ.
(TA.) [Hence,] ↓ لَقِيتُهُ أَدْنَى دَنِىٍّ (S, K, TA)
and ↓ أَدْنَى دَنًا, (K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously,
ادنى دَنّىٰ and ادنى دَنِىٍّ,]) i. e. I met him the
first thing. (S, K.) [And أَدْنَى الفَمِ The fore,
or foremost, part of the mouth.] And الدُّنْيَا [for
الدَّارُ الدُّنْيَا, and الحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا, The former dwelling,
or abode, and life; i. e. the present world, and
life, or state of existence]; contr. of الآخِرَةُ:
(M, K:) [or] it is so called because of its nearness: (T, S:) [and may be rendered the sublunary abode, &c.: and the inferior abode, &c.
It also signifies The enjoyments, blessings, or
good, of the present world, or life; worldly
blessings or prosperity, &c.] And sometimes it is
with tenween, (K, TA,) when used indeterminately: (TA:) [thus,] IAar mentions the saying
مَا لَهُ دُنْيًا وَ لَا آخِرَةٌ [as meaning He has none of
the enjoyments, or blessings, of the present world,
nor in prospect any enjoyments, or blessings, of
the world to come]; with tenween. (M, TA.)
And you say, بَاعَ دُنْيَاهُ بِآخِرَتِهِ [He purchased his
enjoyments of the present world at the expense of
his enjoyments of the world to come]. (Z, TA
in art. بيع.) And اَبْنُ الدُّنْيَا means The rich
man. (Msb in art. بنى.) ―
-b3-  Also More, and
most, apt, fit, or proper: thus in the Kur
[xxxiii. 59], in the phrase ذٰلِكَ أَدْنَى أَنْ يُعَرَفْنَ
[That will be more, or most, apt, fit, or proper,
that they may be known]; (Ksh, Mgh;) i. e.,
that they may be known to be free women, as
distinguished from female slaves, who did not
cover their faces. (Jel.) ―
-b4-  Also Less [in number
or quantity &c.], and least [therein]; opposed to
أَكْثَرُ. (TA.) وَلَا أَدْنَى مِنْ ذٰلِكَ وَلَاأَكْثَرَ, in
the Kur [lviii. 8], means Nor less in number
than that, nor more in number. (Bd.) And
وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُمْ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ الْأَدْنَى دُونَ الْعَذَابِ الْأَكْبَرِ,
in the Kur [xxxii. 21, lit. And we will assuredly
make them to taste of the smaller punishment besides
the greater punishment], means, accord. to Zj, whatever punishment is inflicted in the present world
and the punishment of the world to come. (M.)
―
-b5-  Also Worse, [or inferior in quality,] and
worst; or more, and most, low, ignoble, base,
vile, mean, or weak; opposed to خَيْرٌ. (TA.)
It is said in the Kur [ii. 58], أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ الَّذِى هُوَ
أَدْنَى بِالَّذِى هُوَ خَيْرٌ [Will ye take in exchange
that which is worse, or inferior, for that which is
better? or], accord. to Zj, meaning that which is
less in value [for that which is better]? ادنى
being thus, without ء: Fr says that it is here
from الدَّنَآءَةٌ: and Zuheyr El-Kurkubee [or
(accord. to some) El-Furkubee] read أَدْنَأُ. (T.)
مُدْنٍ and مُدْنِيَةٌ, applied to a she-camel, (M,
K,) and to a woman, (M,) Near to bringing
forth. (M, K.)
مُدَنٍّ, applied to a man, Weak; (S, TA;) contemptible (خَسِيسٌ); not profitable to any one;
who falls short in everything upon which he
enters; [like دَنِىٌّ;] (TA;) or falling short of
accomplishing that which it behooves him to do:
(AHeyth, T:) also, for the sake of rhyme, [by
poetic license,] written مُدَنْ. (T.)
