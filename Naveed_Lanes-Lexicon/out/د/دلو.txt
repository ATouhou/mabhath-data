دلو1
دَلَا الدَّلْوَ, (Mgh, K, [in the CK, دَلّاها is
erroneously put for دَلَاهَا,]) [and دَلَا بِالدَّلْوِ,] first
pers. دَلَوْتُ الدَّلْوَ, (T, S, Msb,) and دَلَوْتُ بِالدَّلْوِ,
(Msb,) aor., first pers., أَدْلُو, inf. n. دَلْوٌ; (T;) and
الدَّلْوَ ↓ ادلى; (Mgh; [the only authority that I
find for the latter verb in the sense here explained;]) He pulled the دَلْو [or bucket] up, or
out, (T, S, Mgh, Msb,) from the well, (T, Mgh,)
full: (T, Mgh:) or he pulled the دلو to make it
come forth. (K.) Hence, i. e. from ادلى الدلو
as explained above, the saying, in a trad., if it be
correct, عَنِ المَآءَ ↓ وَرَدُوا مَآءٍ فَسَأَلُوا أَهْلَهُ أَنْ يُدْلُوهُمْ
[They came to water, and they asked its owners
to draw for them from the water]; for يُدْلُوا لَهُمْ,
or يُدْلُوا دَلْوَهُمْ. (Mgh.) And أَدْلُو حَاجَتِى, from
دَلَوْتُ الدَّلْوَ explained above, means (assumed tropical:)  I seek, or
demand, the accomplishment of my want: (Ham
p. 500:) or دَلَا حَاجَتَهُ means (assumed tropical:)  He sought, or
demanded, the object of his want. (TA.) And
دَلَوْتُ بِفُلَانٍ إِلَيْكَ, (S, TA,) inf. n. as above, (TA,)
(tropical:)  I begged, or beg, such a one to make intercession
for me to thee. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence also,] دَلَا
(assumed tropical:)  He drove, or urged on: (IAar, T:) or did so
gently; for دَلْوٌ [the inf. n.] means the driving, or
urging on, gently. (M.) You say, دَلَوْتُ النَّاقَةَ,
(S, K,) aor. أَدْلُو, (TA,) inf. n. دَلْوٌ, (S, TA,) (tropical:)  I
made the she-camel to go gently, or leisurely.
(S, K, TA.) ―
-b3-  And دَلَوْتُهُ and ↓ دَالَيْتُهُ (tropical:)  I was
gentle with him; namely, a man; (S, K, TA;)
treated him with gentleness or blandishment,
soothed him, coaxed him, or wheedled him;
(S, TA; and K in art. دلى [in which, as is said
in the TK, دَاوَيْتُهُ is erroneously put, in some
copies, for دَارَيْتُهُ];) endeavoured to conciliate
him. (TA.) ―
-b4-  See also 4, in three places.

تَدْلِيَةٌ [inf. n. of دلّى] signifies The lowering
a thing; like ↓ إِدْلَآءٌ [inf. n. of 4]. (Bd in vii.
21.) You say, دلّى الشَّىْءَ فِى مَهْوَاةٍ He let down
the thing, made it to hang down, or let it fall,
into a pit or the like. (T, * M, TA.) And
دَلَّاهُ مِنْ سَطْحٍ بِحَبْلٍ He let him, or it, down from
a house-top by means of a rope. (Mgh.) And
دلّى رِجْلَيْهِ مِنَ السَّرِيرِ [He hung down his legs
from the couch]; and ↓ ادلى occurs in the same
sense. (Mgh.) It is said in a trad., دُلِّىَ عَلَىَّ
جِرَابٌ مِنْ شَحْمٍ مِنْ بَعْضِ حُصُونِ خَيْبَرَ, meaning
[A bag, or provision-bag, of fat] was let down,
or let fall, upon me [from one of the forts of
Kheyber]. (Mgh.) See also 4. ―
-b2-  And دلّى الشَّىْءَ
He made, or brought, or drew, the thing near to
another thing (مِنْ غَيْرِهِ); like الدَّلْوِ ↓ إِدْلَآءُ. (Har
p. 173.) ―
-b3-  دَلَّاهُ بِغُرُورٍ (assumed tropical:)  He caused him to fall
into that which he desired [to bring about] by
exposing him to perdition, or destruction, or loss,
without his knowledge; from الدَّلْوِ ↓ إِدْلَآءُ. (S.)
[In the Kur vii. 21,] فَدَلَّاهُمَا بِغُرُورٍ means (assumed tropical:)  And
he caused them to fall (فدلّاهما) into disobedience
by deceiving, or beguiling, them: so says Aboo-Is-hák [Zj]: or (assumed tropical:)  he excited their cupidity [with
deceit, or guile]; originating from the case of a
thirsty man's being let down (يُدَلَّى) into a well
in order that he may satisfy his thirst from its
water, and his not finding water in it, so that he
is let down into it with deceit, or guile: or it
means he emboldened them to eat of the tree with
deceit, or guile; originally دَلَّلَهُمَا. (T.)

دَالَيْتُهُ: see 1.
4
أَدْلَيْتُ, [in the CK, erroneously, دَلَيْتُ,] and
↓ دَلَوْتُ (K;) or أَدْلَيْتُ الدَّلْوَ, (T, S, M, Mgh,
Msb, K,) inf. n. إِدْلَآءٌ; (T, Msb;) and الدَّلْوَ ↓ دَلَوْتُ,
[and app. بِالدَّلْوِ,] aor. أَدْلُو, [inf. n. دَلْوٌ;] (T, *
Msb;) I let down the دَلْو [or bucket] (T, S, M,
Mgh, Msb, K) into the well, (T, S, Mgh, K,)
to fill it, (T,) or to draw water with it. (M,
Msb.) أَدْلِ دَلْوَكَ فِى الدِّلَآءِ [Let down thy bucket
with the other buckets] is a prov. used in urging
[a person] to strive, or labour, for gain; (TA;)
originating from a company's assembling at a
well, and letting down their buckets in order that
every one of them may take his share of the
water, or what is easily procurable by him thereof:
meaning, use means to acquire, like as do others.
(Har p. 167.) See also 2, in four places. ―
-b2-
Hence, (Mgh,) ادلى بِحُجَّتِهِ (tropical:)  He adduced his
plea, or the like, (T, S, M, Mgh, K,) correctly,
or validly; (T;) or he defended himself by
adducing it or urging it: (S:) or he established
his plea, or the like, and so obtained his claim or
demand or suit. (Msb.) And in like manner you
say, ادلى بِحَقِّهِ (tropical:)  [He urged, or established, his
right or due]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And ادلى بِمَالِهِ (tropical:)  He
gave, (دَفَعَ, M, K, TA,) or presented, or offered,
(رَفَعَ, S, TA,) his property, (S, M, K, TA,)
إِلَيْهِ [to him], (M,) or الى الحَاكِمَ [to the judge].
(S.) Hence, in the Kur [ii. 184], وَتُدْلُوا بِهَا إِلَى,
الحُكَّامِ, (S, K,) i. e. (tropical:)  And [do not] give it, or
offer it, as a bribe to the judges: (S, * TA:) or
and do not endeavour to conciliate with it the
judges in order that they may cut off for you what
is the right of others: (T:) or and do not throw
it to the judges to be decided by them, (Mgh,
Bd, Jel,) or as a bribe. (Jel.) And in a letter of
'Omar, فَافْهَمْ إِذَا أُدْلِىَ إِلَيْكَ And understand thou
when an application is made to thee by litigants
for the decision of a cause. (Mgh.) ―
-b4-  And
ادلى بِرَحِمِهِ (tropical:)  He sought to bring himself near, to
approach, or to gain access, [إِلَى غَيْرِهِ to another,]
by means of his relationship: (S, K, TA:) and
he pleaded, or made intercession, thereby. (TA.)
بِهِ إِلَيْكَ ↓ وَقَدْ دَلَوْنَا, in a prayer for rain, of 'Omar,
referring to El-' Abbás, i. e., accord. to the
“ Ghareebeyn,” (assumed tropical:)  And we have sought to approach, or to gain access, to Thee by him, app.
means that they sought to obtain the mercy and
aid of God [by means of his intercession], like as
one seeks to get at, or obtain, the water by means
of the دَلْو [or bucket]. (M.) One says also,
أَدْلَى إِلَى المَيَّتِ بِالبُنُوَّةِ وَنَحْوِهَا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He
was united to the dead by sonship, and the like;
from إِدْلَآءُ الدَّلْوِ. (Msb.) And فُلَانٌ يُدْلِى إِلَى
المَيِّتِ بِذَكِرٍ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is united with the dead
by a male. (Mgh.) ―
-b5-  ادلى فِيهِ means (tropical:)  He said
of him what was evil, or foul. (M, K.) ―
-b6-  And
ادلى said of a horse &c., He put forth his yard,
for the purpose of staling or covering; (M, K;)
as also ↓ دلّى said of an ass, as is also the former
verb. (M.) ―
-b7-  See also 1, first and second
sentences.

تدلّى It was let down or lowered; it hung
down, or dangled; it was let down; (T, * M,
Mgh;) into, and over, a pit or the like; (M;) it
hung (K) from (مِنْ) a tree; (S, K) it hung down
as a fruit [from a tree]. (Bd in liii. 8.) [Hence,]
تدلّى عَلَيْنَا مِنْ أَرْضِ كَذَا [He, or it, came down,
or descended, upon us from such a land]. (TA.)
And تدلّى بِالشَّرِّ He descended upon one with evil,
or mischief. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also He drew near, or
approached: (K in art. دلى:) or he drew near,
or approached, [from above, or] after being high.
(IAar, T.) Accord. to Fr, ثُمَّ دَنَا فَتَدَلَّى [in the
Kur liii. 8] means ثَمَّ تَدَلَّى فَدَنَا, (T,) i. e. Then
he (Gabriel) hung down from the highest region
of the sky, and so drew near to the Apostle:
showing that he took him up without becoming
separated from his place: or the meaning of the
phrase, as it stands, is, then he drew near to the
Prophet, and he clung to him: (Bd:) but accord.
to Zj, it means then he drew near, and drew
nearer; and is like the phrase دَنَا فُلَانٌ مِنِّى وَقَرُبَ.
(T. [See also another explanation in what follows.]) ―
-b3-  And He was, or became, lowly,
humble, or submissive; or he lowered, humbled,
or abased, himself. (IAar, T; and K in art.
دلى.) ―
-b4-  In the saying of a poet,
كَأَنَ رَاكِبَهَا غُصْنٌ بِمَرْوَحَةٍ
إِذَا تَدَلَّتْ بِهِ أَوْ شَارِبٌ ثَمِلٌ
تدلّت may be quasi-pass. of دَلَا, inf. n. دَلْوٌ, signifying “ he drove, or urged on, gently: ” or it
may be for تَدَلَّلَتْ: [so that the meaning may
be, As though her rider were a branch of a
tree in a place over which the wind was blowing,
when she became urged on gently with him, or
an intoxicated drinker: or, when she emboldened
herself with him, &c.:] (M:) [for] تَدَلَّى is also
syn. with تَدَلَّلَ: (S, K:) and [J says that] this
is its meaning in the saying in the Kur [otherwise explained above] ثُمَّ دَنَا فَتَدَلَّى: being like
يَتَمَطَّى in the Kur [lxxv. 33], i. e. يَتَمَطَّطُ. (S.)
12
اِدْلَوْلَى, of the measure اِفْعَوْعَلَ, He hastened,
made haste, sped, or went quickly; (S;) [like
اذلولى.]
دَلًا: see what next follows.
دَلْوٌ [A bucket, generally of leather;] a certain
thing with which one draws water; (S, TA;) a
vessel with which one draws water from a well;
(KL;) well known; (T, K;) in Pers. دول [i. e.
دُولْ, pronounced “ dól ”]: (MA:) masc. and
fem.; (M;) sometimes masc.; (K;) mostly
fem., (M, Msb,) and thus accord. to the more
approved usage: (M:) pl. (of pauc., T, S, Msb)
أَدْلٍ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) of the measure أَفْعُلٌ,
[originally أَدْلُوٌ,] (S,) and (of mult., T, * S, Msb)
دِلَآءٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and دُلِىٌّ, (S, M, Msb, K,)
which is of the measure فُعُولٌ (S, Msb) originally,
(Msb,) and دِلِىٌّ (T, M, K, omitted in the CK)
and دُلِيَّةٌ, omitted here by the author of the K but
mentioned by him in art. نحو, (TA,) and ↓ دَلَا;
(K; [there said to be like عَلَى; but correctly
دَلًا;]) or دَلًا is syn. with دِلَآءٌ, and its sing. [or
n. un.] is ↓ دَلَاةٌ; (S, M;) like as that of فَلًا is
فَلَاةٌ; (M;) [for] دَلَاةٌ is syn. with دَلْوٌ: (T:) or
دَلَاةٌ signifies, (K,) or signifies also, (M,) a small
دَلْو. (M, K. [But in the M, in one place, it
seems to be stated that, accord. to some, دَلَاةٌ and
دَلًا signify the same, in a pl. sense: for, after the
pls. of دَلْوٌ, it is added, وَهِىَ الدَّلَاةُ وَالدَّلَا. I think,
however, that he who first said this meant
thereby that الدَّلَاةُ and الدَّلَا signify, respectively,
the same as الدَّلْوُ and الدِّلَآءُ &c.]) [Hence the
saying, أَتْبِعِ الدَّلْوَ رِشَآءَهَا: see 4 in art. تبع.] As
masc., it has for its dim. ↓ دُلَّىٌّ: as fem., ↓ دُلَيَّةٌ.
(Msb.) See also دَالِيَةٌ. ―
-b2-  And hence, (M,) الدَّلْوُ
(tropical:)  [The sign of Aquarius;] one of the signs of the
Zodiac. (S, M, K.) ―
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  The hopper of a
mill. (Golius on the authority of Meyd.) ―
-b4-
And (assumed tropical:)  A certain mark made with a hot iron
upon camels; (S, K;) app. in the form of a دَلْو
[properly so called]. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  Calamity,
misfortune, or mischief. (S, K.) So in the saying, جَآءَ فُلَانٌ بِالدَّلْوِ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one brought calamity, &c.]. (S.)
دَلَاةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph. ―
-b2-
[Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A share, or portion: so in the saying
of a rájiz,
آلَيْتُ لَا أُعْطِىَ غُلَامًا أَبَدَا
دَلَاتَهُ إِنِّى أُحِبُّ الأَسْوَدَا
meaning [I have sworn, or, emphatically, I
swear, I will not give a boy, ever,] his share, or
portion, of love, or affection: [verily I love ElAswad:] El-Aswad was the name of his son.
(S, TA.)
دُلَىٌّ: see دَلْوٌ, of which they are dims.
دُلَيَّةٌ: see دَلْوٌ, of which they are dims.
دَالٍ Pulling up, or out, a دَلْو [or bucket] from
a well: (T:) and occurring in poetry in the
sense of مُدْلٍ [meaning letting down a دَلْو into a
well]: (S:) pl. دُلَاةٌ. (TA.)
دَالِيَةٌ A [water-wheel, or machine for irrigating land, such as is called] مَنْجَنُون, (S, M, K,)
that is turned by an ox or a cow: (S:) and
[such as is called] a نَاعُورَة: (K:) or the ناعورة is
turned by water: (S:) and a thing made of
palm-leaves (M, K) and pieces of wood, with
which water is drawn [for irrigating land] by
means of ropes, or cords, (M,) [app. held and
drawn at one end by a man, and at the other
end] tied to a tall palm-trunk: (M, K:) it is a
bucket (دَلْو), and the like, with pieces of wood
made in the form of a cross, [i. e. with two
pieces of wood placed across and so tied together,]
the two arms of which are bound to the top [or
rim] of the bucket; them one end of a rope is
tied to it, and the other end to a palm-trunk
standing at the head of the well; and one irrigates [land] with it [app. by drawing and swinging it up by means of another, or of the same,
rope]: the word is of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ in the
sense of the measure مَفْعُولَةٌ [because it is pulled
up]: the pl. is دَوَالٍ: El-Fárábee deviates from
others, by explaining it as meaning a مَنْجَنُون;
and J follows him: (Msb:) [a similar apparatus
for irrigating land is used in the northern parts
of Egypt, called قَطْوَة and ↓ دَلْو: it consists of
a bowl-shaped bucket, with four cords attached
to its rim: two men, each holding two of the
cords, throw up the water by means of it into
a trough or trench: accord. to Mtr,] the دَالِيَة is
a tall palm-trunk set in the manner of the machine
with which rice is beaten [to remove the husks],
having at its head a large bowl, with which
water is drawn [for irrigating land]. (Mgh.)
―
-b2-  Also Land that is irrigated by means of the
دَلْو [or bucket] or the [machine called] مَنْجَنُون
[mentioned above]. (M, K.) ―
-b3-  And the pl.,
دَوَالٍ, Unripe dates hung, and eaten when they
become ripe. (T, K.) Hung fruit. (Bd in liii. 8.
[But perhaps الثمر is there a mistranscription
for التّمْرُ.]) ―
-b4-  Also (i. e. the pl.) Black grapes,
but not intensely black, (AHn, M, K,) the bunches
of which are the largest of all bunches, appearing
like goats hung [upon the vines]: the berries
thereof are coarse, breaking in the mouth, and
round; and are dried. (AHn, M.) [See also
دَوَالِىُّ, in art. دوال.) ―
-b5-  [The sing. also signifies A
grape-vine itself: and a shoot of a grape-vine:
pl. as above.]
