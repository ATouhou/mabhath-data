دَفِىَ, [aor. يَدْفَى,] inf. n. دَفًا, He, or it, was,
or became, such as is termed أَدْفَى, in any of the
senses of this epithet. (M.) [See also 4.]
-A2-
دَفَوْتُ الجَرِيحَ, (S, K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously,
دَفَيْتُ,]) aor. أَدْفُوهُ, inf. n. دَفْوٌ; (S, TA;) and
↓ دَافَيْتُهُ and ↓ أَدْفَيْتُهُ; (A'Obeyd, S, K;) I despatched the wounded man; i. e. hastened and
completed his slaughter; or made his slaughter
sure, or certain: (A'Obeyd, S, K:) and so
دَافَأْتُهُ and أَدْفَأْتُهُ (TA) [and دَافَقْتُهُ &c.: see 3 in
art. دف]. Accord. to Ibn-Abi-l-Hadeed, دَفَى,
[or rather دَفَا,] sometimes pronounced with ء,

-A2-  It is related in a trad. that a
captive was brought to the Prophet, (S, TA,)
shivering by reason of cold, (TA,) and he said to
some persons, اِذْهَبُوا بِهِ فَأَدْفُوهُ, meaning [Take ye
him away and] clothe him so as to protect him
from the cold; (S, TA;) for أَدْفِئُوهُ; because the
pronunciation of ء was not of the dial. of Kureysh;
but they thought that he meant slaughter; (TA;)
and they took him away and slew him: therefore
he paid the fine for his blood. (S, TA.) As is
said in the K, أَدْفَيْتُ is a dial. var. of أَدْفَأْتُ.
(TA.)
-A3-  ادفى said of a gazelle, His horns were,
or became, so long as almost to reach his hinder
part. (T, K.) [See also دَفِىَ.]

التَّدَافِى i. q. التَّدَارُكُ [app. in relation to a
camel's pace, or manner of going, as meaning The
continuing uninterruptedly]: (K:) and التَّدَاوُلُ

follows; and the same seems to be indicated in
the S:] and a camel's going along with an inclining from side to side (أَنْ يَسِيرَ سَيْرًا مُتَجَافِيًا):
(K:) you say, تَدَافَى البَعِيرُ, meaning سَارَ سَيْرًا
مُتَجَافِيًا [The camel went along with an inclining
from side to side]. (S.) [See also the second of
the verses cited in the first paragraph of art. دف:
from the explanation of which by ISd, it appears
that تَدَافَى is perhaps originally تَدَافَّ.]
