دَأَلَ, aor.
دَاَ^َ, inf. n. دَأْلٌ (S, M, K) and دَأَلٌ
(K [perhaps a mistake for the next, which is
well known but not mentioned in the K, but see
ذَأَلَ,]) and دَأَلَانٌ (S, M) and دَأَلَى, (M, K,) He
walked, or went, in a weak manner, (M, K,) and
with haste: (M:) or he ran with short steps:
(M, K:) or he walked, or went, in a brisk, or
sprightly, manner: (K:) or he walked, or went,
as though labouring in his gait, by reason of
briskness, or sprightliness: (M:) [or he went
along by little and little, stealthily, lest he should
make a sound to be heard: for] دَأْلٌ is syn. with
خَتْلٌ: or, accord. to AZ, it signifies the walking,
or going, in a manner resembling that which is
termed خَتْلٌ; and in the manner of him who is
heavily burdened, or overburdened: and As, in
describing the manner in which horses go, explains دَأَلَانٌ as signifying the walking, or going,
with short steps, and in an unusual manner, as
though heavily burdened, or overburdened. (S.)

above, inf. n. دَأْلٌ and دَأَلَانٌ, He deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or outwitted, him;
syn. خَتَلَهُ: (M, K:) [and ↓ دَاأَلَهُ signifies the
same: or he practised with him mutual deceit,
delusion, &c.: for] مُدَاأَلَةٌ is syn. with مُخَاتَلَةٌ;
and sometimes it is with a quick pace: (AA,
T, K:) you say, دَأَلْتُ لَهُ and دَاأَلْتُهُ: (AA, T,
TA:) and الذِّئْبُ بَدْأَلُ لِلْغَزَالِ لِيَأْكُلَهُ i. e. يَخْتُلُهُ
[The wolf deceives, &c., the gazelle, or young
gazelle, that he may eat him]. (AZ, T, TA.)

wolf: and a certain small animal resembling
what is called اِبْنُ عِرْسٍ [the weasel]: (K accord.
to the TA: [accord. to the CK, and app. most
MS. copies of the K, ↓ دَأْلٌ has the last two significations, and not the first signification: but
this is inconsistent with what follows the last signification in the K, as it would require us to read
that الدَّأْلُ, instead of الدُّئِلُ, which is well known
as the correct form, is the name of the father of a
certain tribe:]) دُئِلٌ has the last of these significations: (T, S:) or it signifies a certain small
animal resembling the fox; and this is well
known: and accord. to Kr. ↓ دُؤُلٌ signifies a certain small animal; but this is not known: and
accord. to him also, ↓ دَأَلَانٌ, with fet-h to the ء,
signifies the wolf; (M;) as also ذَأَلَانٌ; (TA;)
or so ↓ دَأْلَانٌ and ذَأْلَانٌ; and also the jackal.
(Lth in art. ذأل.) دُئِلٌ is the only instance of the
measure فُعِلٌ (S, K) known to Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà, (S,) i. e. Th: (TA:) but there are several
other instances: (MF, TA:) [one of these is رُئِمٌ,
or الرُّئِمُ.]
دَأْلَانٌ and دَأَلَانٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in three places.
دُؤْلُولٌ A calamity, or misfortune: (S, M, O,
K:) pl. دَآلِيلُ. (S.) And Confusion. (K.) You
say, وَقَعَ القَوْمُ فِى دُؤْلُولٍ The people, or party,
fell into confusion in respect of their case or
affairs. (S.)
دَؤُولٌ [That runs in the manner termed دَأَلَانٌ,
inf. n. of 1,] is [an epithet] from الدالان [i. e.
الدَّأَلَانُ], which signifies a kind of running, as
also ↓ دَأالين and ↓ دااليل [i. e. دَآلِينُ and دَآليلُ,
pls. of دَأَلَانٌ; the latter irreg., like ذَآلِيلُ pl. of
دَأَلَانٌ, q. v.]. (Ham p. 458.) [See also ذَؤُولٌ.]
دَآلِيلُ and دَآلِينُ: see what next precedes.
