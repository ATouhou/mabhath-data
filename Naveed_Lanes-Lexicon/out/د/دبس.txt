(M;) He (a horse, S, M, K, and a sheep, or
goat, M, and a bird, S) became black: (K:) or
[brown; i. e.] of a colour between black and red;

إِدْبَاْسَّ see 9. ادباسّت الأَرْضُ The blackness of the
land became mixed with redness. (M, TA.)
دَبْسٌ Anything black. (Lth, A, K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,
app.,] Much people; as also ↓ دِبْسٌ: (IAar, K:)
the former is also common to other things; (M, *
TA;) so that you say مَالٌ دَبْسٌ, meaning much
property. (TA.)
دُبْسٌ: see the next paragraph.
دِبْسٌ (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ دُبْسٌ (M)
and ↓ دِبِسٌ (K) The expressed juice of fresh
ripe dates; (A, Mgh, Msb;) what flows from
fresh ripe dates; (S;) the honey of dates; [i. e.
the sweet, thick, or inspissated, juice thereof;]
(M, K;) the expressed juice of dates, (M,) or of
fresh ripe dates not cooked: (AHn, M:) what
is called صَقْرٌ in the dial. of the people of ElMedeeneh: said by some to be the honey of fresh
ripe dates: by some, what flows, or exudes, from
raisins and from fresh grapes: and by some,
what flows from the baskets of dates: (TA:)
[see also رُبٌّ, in an explanation of which the inspissated juice of any fruit is termed its دِبْس:]
also the honey of bees, عَسَلُ النَّحْلُ: so in the
copies of the K and in [some of the copies of] the
A; a signification not known; but [AHn] EdDeenawaree mentions the word دَبَاسَاتٌ, and explains it as signifying “ domestic bee-hives; ” and
by this it is seen that the application of دبس to
what bees eject may be correct: or the true reading may be عَسَلُ النَّخْلِ, with خ, as in some
copies of the A; and it may be meant as explaining what precedes, meaning the expressed juice of
the fruit of the palm-tree, by a kind of trope;
though, as such, a useless repetition: but it is
said in the O, on the authority of IDrd, that
bees' honey is called ↓ دِبِسٌ: (TA:) the vulgar
apply the word to [the inspissated juice of fresh
ripe grapes, which resembles thick honey: and
sometimes to] the honey of raisins. (MF.)
