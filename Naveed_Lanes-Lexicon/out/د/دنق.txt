دنق1
دَنَقَ, aor.
دَنُقَ and
دَنِقَ, inf. n. دُنُوقٌ, He pursued
small, little, or minute, things. (JK, Ibn-'Abbád,
Z, K. [See also 2.]) [Two other significations
assigned to دَنَقَ in the CK and in the Lexicons of
Golius and Freytag belong to دَنَّقَ.]

دنّق, (S, Mgh, TA,) inf. n. تَدْنِيقٌ, (Mgh,
K,) He went to the utmost point [in his dealings
&c.]: (S, K, TA:) he was minute, observant of
small things, nice, or scrupulous: (Mgh:) he
examined minutely into his dealings and expenses.
(So accord. to an explanation of the act. part. n.
in the TA.) Hence the saying, لَا تُدَنَّقُوا فَيُدَنَّقَ
عَلَيْكُمْ [Go not ye to the utmost point against
others, for in that case the utmost point may be
gone to against you]. (S, TA.) And the saying
of El-Hasan, (Mgh, TA,) لَعَنَ اللّٰهُ الدَّانَقَ وَ مَنْ
دَنَّقَ, (TA,) or وَ مَنْ دَنَّقَ بِهِ, (Mgh,) [May God
curse the دانق and him who has been minute, &c.,
in his dealings, or and him who has been minute,
&c., therewith;] as though he meant to forbid the
considering and examining a paltry or contemptible thing: (TA:) or, as some relate it, وَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ
أَحْدَثَ الدَّانَقَ [and the first who innovated the
دانَق], meaning El-Hajjáj. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
تَدْنِيقٌ, metonymically, signifies (tropical:)  The being niggardly, stingy, or avaricious. (Az, TA.) ―
-b3-  Also
The continuing to look at a thing; (S, K;) as
also تَرْنِيقٌ: [or rather each has this signification
elliptically; for] you say, دنّق إِلَيْهِ النَّظَرَ and رنّق
[meaning He continued looking at it]. (S.)
[See رَنَّقَ.] And in like manner, The looking
weakly. (S, TA.) And دنّق بَصَرَهُ He looked
hard, and sharply, or intently. (JK.) ―
-b4-  Also
(tropical:)  The approaching of the sun to setting. (S, K,
TA.) You say, دنّقت الشَّمْسُ (tropical:)  The sun became
near to setting. (JK, TA. [See also رنّقت.])
―
-b5-  And دنّق (tropical:)  He (a man) died: (JK, TA:) or
(tropical:)  he was near to dying; inf. n. as above. (TA.)
―
-b6-  And دنّقت عَيْنُهُ, (JK, K, TA, [accord. to the
CK دَنَقَتْ, which is wrong,]) inf. n. تَدْنِيقٌ, (S,
TA,) (tropical:)  His eye sank, or became depressed, in his
head: (JK, S, K, TA:) or, accord. to Az, the
more correct explanation is, the ball, or globe,
of his eye became prominent, and apparent.
(TA.) ―
-b7-  And دنّق وَجْهُهُ, (Lth, K, TA, [in the
CK, erroneously, دَنَقَ,]) inf. n. تَدْنِيقٌ, (Lth, TA,)
His face exhibited emaciation, arising from
fatigue or disease. (Lth, K, TA.)
دُنُوقٌ [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned]
Persons niggardly, or parsimonious, in expenditure, towards their households (IAar, K, TA)
and themselves. (IAar, TA.)
دَنِيقٌ One who alights by himself, (TA,) and
eats by himself in the daytime, and in the moonlight by night, last the guest should see him: (K,
TA:) mentioned by IAar, on the authority of Abu-I-Mekárim: and so كِيصٌ and صُوصٌ. (TA.)
دَانَقٌ: see the next paragraph.
دَانِقٌ Foolish; stupid; having little, or no,
intellect, or understanding: (K:) and so دَائِقٌ.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  (tropical:)  A thief. (JK, Ibn-'Abbád, K, TA.)
―
-b3-  Emaciated and falling down, or emaciated
and tottering; expl. by مَهْزُولٌ سَاقِطٌ: (AA, S, K:)
or falling down, or tottering, (سَاقِطٌ,) by reason of
emaciation: (JK:) applied to a man (AA, K)
and to a she-camel. (K.) ―
-b4-  Having a constant,
or chronic, disease, and oppressed thereby so as to
be at the point of death. (AA, TA.)
-A2-  Also,
and ↓ دَانَقَ, (JK, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) the former,
accord. to some, the more chaste, arabicized [from
the Pers. دَانْك or دَانَك], (Msb,) and ↓ دَانَاقٌ,
(JK, S, K,) like as they said دِرْهَمٌ and دِرْهَامٌ, (S,)
[but دَانَاقٌ seems to have been disallowed by Sb,
either as unused or as post-classical,] The sixth
part of a dirhem (or drachm); (S, Msb, K;)
[i. e.] two carats; (Mgh;) [i. e.] two grains of
the خُرْنُوب [or carob], with the ancient Greeks,
for the dirhem with them was twelve grains of
the خرنوب; but the دانق of the Muslims is two
grains of the خرنوب and two thirds of a grain of
the خرنوب, for the dirhem of the Muslims is
sixteen grains of the خرنوب: (Msb:) and the
sixth part of the deenár: (TA: [but this I find
nowhere else: see دِينَارٌ: and see also رِطْلٌ:]) the
pl. of دانق is دَوَانِقُ and دَوَانِيقُ; (Mgh, TA;) the
former is said by Az to be pl. of دَانِقٌ; and the
latter, of دَانَقٌ; and it is said that every pl. of the
measure فَوَاعِلُ or مَفَاعِلُ may be lengthened with
ى so that one may say فَوَاعِيلُ and مَفَاعِيلُ:
(Msb:) or, accord. to Sb, دَوَانِيقُ is pl. of ↓ دَانَاقٌ,
though this be not in their speech. (TA.) [Also
A small silver coin, the sixth part of the coin
called دِرْهَم.] The dim. is ↓ دُوَيْنِيقٌ. (TA.)
دَانَاقٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two
places.
دَوَانِقِىٌّ [rel. n. from دَوَانِقُ pl. of دَانِقٌ], (ElMekeen, “Hist. Sarac. ” p. 104,) or دَوَانِيقِىٌّ
[rel. n. from دَوَانِيقُ pl. of دَانَاقٌ], (TA,) [Of, or
belonging or relating to, dániks: and hence,] a
surname of the 'Abbásee Khaleefeh Aboo-Jaáfar
El-Mansoor; (El-Mekeen, TA;) because of his
extreme niggardliness. (El-Mekeen.)
دُوَينِيْقٌ: see دَانِقٌ, last sentence.
مُدَنِّقٌ One who examines minutely into his
dealings and expenses: used in this sense by the
people of El-'Irák. (TA.) ―
-b2-  عَيْنٌ مُدَنِّقَةٌ An eye
of which the ball, or globe, is prominent, and
apparent: so accord. to AZ; and Az holds this
to be the correct explanation, rather than an eye
sunk, or depressed, in the head. (TA.)
