دَرَدَ, (S,) inf. n. دَرَدٌ,
(S, * M, Mgh, L, K, *) He was, or became, toothless; (S, L;) he lost his teeth. (M, Mgh, L, K.)
It is said in a trad., أُمِرْتُ بِالسِّوَاكِ حَتَّى خِفْتُ
لَأَدْرَدَنَّ (S, Mgh *) I was commanded to make use
of the tooth-stick until I feared, meaning I
thought, or opined, that I should assuredly become
toothless: for the Arabs use ظَنَّ in the same
manner as a verb signifying an oath, and give it
the same kind of complement, saying, ظَنَنْتُ لَعَبْدُ
اللّٰهُ خَيْرٌ مِنْكَ: (S:) or, accord. to one relation,
the words of this trad. are لَزِمْتُ السِّوَاكَ حَتَّى
خَشِيتُ أَنْ يَدْرَدَنِى [a mistranscription for ↓ يُدْرِدَنِى,
from أَدْرَدَ, i. e. I kept to the use of the toothstick until I feared that it would deprive me of
my teeth, or render me toothless]: (L:) or,
accord. to another relation, ↓ خَشِيتُ أَنْ أُدْرِدَ
أَسْنَانِى [I feared that I should make my teeth to
fall out]; but this [verb, Mtr says,] I have not
heard. (Mgh.)
