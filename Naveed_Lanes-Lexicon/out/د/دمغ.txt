دمغ1
دَمَغَةٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
دَمَغَ (IDrd,
Msb, K) and
دَمُغَ, (IDrd, K,) inf. n. دَمْغٌ, (S,
Msb,) He broke his head so that the wound
reached the دِمَاغ [or brain]: (S, K:) or he broke
the bone of his دِمَاغ: (Msb:) or he struck it,
namely, a person's head, so that the stroke reached
to the دِمَاغ: (Mgh:) and he struck his دِمَاغ,
(K, TA,) and broke the interior of the skull,
next the دِمَاغ. (TA.) And دَمَغَتْهُ الشَّمْسُ The
sun pained his دِمَاغ. (IDrd, K.) ―
-b2-  Also, inf. n.
as above, (tropical:)  He overcame, or subdued, and abased,
him, or it: like as the truth does falsehood: and
hence فَيَدْمَغَهُ in the Kur [xxi. 18], meaning (tropical:)  so
that it may overcome it, or prevail over it, and
abolish it: or, accord. to Az, so that it may do
away with it, in such a manner as to render it
despicable, or ignominious. (TA.) And ↓ دمّغهُ
signifies (tropical:)  He overcame him, or prevailed over
him, much, so as to subdue him, or abase him.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence, app.,] دُمِغَتِ الأَرْضُ (assumed tropical:)  [The
produce of] the land was eaten. (IAar, TA.)
―
-b4-  And دَمَغَهُمْ بِمُطْفَئَةِ الرَّضْفِ (tropical:)  He slaughtered
for them a lean sheep or goat: (K:) so says
Lh, except that he does not explain the verb,
which is thus explained by Ibn-'Abbád and Z:
(TA:) or, as some say, a fat sheep or goat. (K.)
-A2-  دمغت حَوِيَّتَهَا, [the verb written in the L and
TA without teshdeed, so that it is app. دَمَغَتْ,
but it may be ↓ دَمَّغَتْ,] She (a woman) made, or
put, a دَامِغَة [q. v.] to her حويّة [or stuffed thing
whereon she rode upon her camel]. (ISh, L, TA.)
2
دمّغ, inf. n. تَدْمِيغٌ, (tropical:)  He made a ثَرِيدَة [or
mess of crumbled, or broken, bread,] soft with
grease, or gravy. (Ibn-'Abbád, A, K.) ―
-b2-  See
also 1, in two places.
الدِّمَاغُ a word of which the signification is well
known; (S, Msb;) [The brain;] the marrow of
the head; (K;) or the stuffing of the head:
(TA:) or [app. a mistake for “and” (what
is termed)] أُمُّ الهَامِ or أُمُّ الرَّأْسِ or [in one
copy of the K “and”] أُمُّ الدِّمَاغِ is a thin
skin, like a pouch, in which it is contained: (K:)
[these three terms, امّ الهام and امّ الرأس and امّ
الدماغ, appear all to signify the meninx; (see أُمٌّ;)
but the first and second of them seem to have
been mistaken by the author or transcribers of the
K for different explanations of الدَّمَاغُ:] the pl.
[of pauc.] is أَدْمِغَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and [of mult.]
دُمُغٌ. (TA.)
دَمِيغٌ and ↓ مَدْمُوغٌ Having his head broken so
that the wound reaches the دِمَاغ [or brain]:
(IDrd, K:) the former is likewise applied to a
woman: and the pl., applied to men and to
women, is دَمْغَى. (IDrd, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, both
words, (assumed tropical:)  Stupid; foolish; or unsound, or dull, or
deficient, in intellect: ↓ مُدَمَّغٌ is incorrectly used
by the vulgar in this sense; (K, TA;) as though
meaning overcome, so as to be subdued, or abased,
by the devil: it is said in the “Námoos” that
this last word may be correct as having an intensive signification; but it may admit of such a
signification, and yet may be incorrect, not heard
from persons of chaste speech. (TA.)
دَامِغَةٌ A wound in the head, reaching the دِمَاغ
[or brain]; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) with which there
is no living: (Msb:) it is the last [in degree] of
[the wounds termed] شِجَاج [pl. of شَجَّةٌ]; these
being ten, as follows: [1] قَاشِرَةٌ, also called حَارِصَةٌ
(S, K, TA) and حَرْصَةٌ, or, as some think, the
حارصة or حرصة is different from the قاشرة: (TA:)
[2] بَاضِعَةٌ: [3] دَامِيَةٌ: [4] مُتَلَاحِمَةٌ: [5] سِمْحَاقٌ:
[6] مُوضِحَةٌ: [7] هَاشِمَةٌ: [8] مُنَقَّلَةٌ: [9] آمَّةٌ, (S,
K, TA,) also termed مَأْمُومَةٌ: (TA:) [10] دَامِغَةٌ:
(S, K, TA:) and A'Obeyd adds دَامِعَةٌ, with the
unpointed ع, after دَامِيَةٌ; (S;) or, accord. to F,
who pronounces J to have erred in saying thus,
before دامية: but J is right in this case. (TA.)
[See شَجَّةٌ دَامِعَةٌ, voce دَامِعٌ. Several other terms
are mentioned in the TA; but these, which will
be found in their proper arts., appear to be all
syn. with some that are mentioned above. See
also شَجَّةٌ.] ―
-b2-  Also A spadix (طَلْعَةٌ) that comes
forth from amid the broken portions of the قُلْب
[or heart of the palm-tree], long and hard, and,
if left, mars the palm-tree; (S, K, * TA;) wherefore, when its existence is known, it is detached.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And An iron above the مُؤَخَّرَة [or
hinder part] of the [camel's saddle called] رَحْل;
(As, K;) also called غَاشِيَةٌ: (TA:) or an iron
with which the back of the رحْل is fastened:
(JK:) the pl. is دَوَامِغُ: ISh says that the دوامغ
are above the middle of the heads, or upper extremities, of the [curved pieces of wood called]
أَحْنَآء [pl. of حِنْوٌ]; and sometimes they are of
wood, firmly bound; and i. q. خَذَارِيفُ, pl. of
خُذْرُوفٌ [q. v.]: [but] Az says that when the
دامغة is of iron, it is placed across, or athwart,
above the two extremities of the حِنْوَانِ, and
nailed with two nails, the خذاريف being fastened
upon the heads of the cross-pieces, in order that
it, or they, may not become disconnected. (TA.)
[What it is, I am unable further to explain. It
is perhaps thus called because so placed that a
person is liable to have his head wounded by it.]
―
-b4-  And A piece of wood placed across between
two poles, upon which is hung the skin for water
or milk. (JK, Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
دَامُوغٌ One that wounds so as to reach the دِمَاغٌ
[or brain]; and that breaks the head or the like.
(Ibn-'Abbád, K.) And حَجَرٌ دَامُوغَةٌ A stone
that does so much, or vehemently: the ة denoting
intensiveness of signification. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
مُدَمَّغٌ: see دَمِيَغٌ.
مَدْمُوعٌ: see دَمِيَغٌ.
