دحو.
دَحَيْتُهُ A single act of دَحْىٌ, i. e. spreading,
&c. (Msb.)
-A2-  A she-ape, or she-monkey. (K.)
دِحْيَةٌ A mode, or manner, of دَحْىٌ, i. e. spreading, &c. (Msb.)
-A2-  A headman, or chief, (R,
K, TA,) in an absolute sense, in the dial. of ElYemen, (R, TA,) and particularly, of an army,
or a military force. (K, TA.) AA says that it
originally signifies “ a lord,” or “ chief,” in
Pers.; but seems to be from دَحَاهُ, aor. يَدْحُوهُ,
meaning “ he spread it, and made it plain or
even; ” because it is for the headman or chief to
do this; the و being changed into ى as it is in
صِبْيَةٌ and فِتْيَةٌ; and if so, it belongs to art. دحو.
(TA.) [Accord. to Golius, the pl. is دِحَآءٌ; but
I think that it is more probably دِحًى.] It is
said in a trad. that what is called البَيْتُ المَعْمُورُ
[q. v. in art. عمر] is entered every day by seventy
thousand companies of angels, every one of these
companies having with it a دِحْيَة and consisting
of seventy thousand angels. (TA.)
