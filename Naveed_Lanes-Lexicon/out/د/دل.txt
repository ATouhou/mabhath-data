saying of Keys Ibn-Zoheyr,
أَظُنُّ الحِلْمَ دَلَّ عَلَىَّ قَوْمِى
وَقَدْ يُسْتَجْهَلُ الرَّجُلُ الحَلِيمُ
[I think that forbearance hath emboldened against
me my people: for sometimes the forbearing man
is reckoned ignorant]: (T:) and ↓ دلّل signifies
the same. (T and TA in art. دلو.)

فَإِنْ كُنْتِ قَدْ أَزْمَعْتِ صَرْمِى فَأَجْمِلِى
[O Fátimeh (فاطم being a contraction of فَاطِمَةُ),
act thou gently: relinquish somewhat of this
boldness; (or, as is said in the EM, p. 15, of this
amorous gesture or behaviour, and coquettish
boldness, and feigned coyness or opposition; see
1;) and if thou have determined upon cutting
me, act with goodness, or moderation]. (TA.)
―
-b2-  Also He confided in his love, and therefore
acted presumptuously towards him. (IDrd, M,
K. *) In the copies of the K, أَوْثَقَ is here put
in the place of وَثِقَ. (TA.) [And in the CK,
أَوْثَقَ بِحَبَّتِه is put for وَثِقَ بِمُحَبِّتِهِ.] Hence,

(S, M, TA:) a prov. (M, TA.) ―
-b3-  One says

adduced an indication, &c.: and he drew an inference, or a deduction: (KL:) or he established
an indication for the purpose of obtaining a
certain knowledge of a thing indicated, or for
the purpose of affirming a thing indicated: and
sometimes it is quasi-pass. of دَلَّهُ الطَّرِيقَ [explained above, so that it signifies he was, or became,
directed, or rightly directed, to the way]. (TA.
See 1.) [You say, استدلّ بِشَىْءٍعَلَى شَىْءٍ آخَرَ
He desired, or sought, to be directed, or guided,

thing, or an argument in favour of another
thing: he was, or became, directed, or guided, or
he directed or guided himself, by a thing, to
another thing, or to the knowledge of another
thing. الدَّلِيلُ مَا يُسْتَدَلَّ بِهِ, occurring in the S,
means The دليل is that whereby one is directed,
or guided.]

R. Q. 2
تَدَلْدَلَ It was, or became, in a state
of motion or commotion, or it moved about, (T,
S, K,) hanging down; i. e. it dangled: (S, K:)
it hung down loosely. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
تَدَلْدَلُوا بَيْنَ أَمْرَيْنِ فَلَمْ يَسْتَقِيمُوا [(assumed tropical:)  They wavered,
vacillated, or hung in suspense, between two
affairs, and did not pursue a direct course]. (Lh,
T, K.)
دَلٌّ Amorous gesture or behaviour, of a woman,
with coquettish boldness, and feigned coyness or
opposition; as also ↓ دَلَالٌ: (S, M:) the former is
an inf. n., [see 1,] and ↓ the latter is a simple
subst.; (Msb;) both signifying a woman's boldness of behaviour (M, Msb, K) towards the
husband, (M, K,) with amorous gesture, and
coquettishness, feigning opposition; (M, Msb, K;)
as also ↓ دَالُولَآءُ, (K,) and ↓ دَالَّةٌ: (Har p. 567:)
or دَلٌّ signifies a woman's pleasing talk and
jesting and mien or guise; as also ↓ دَلَالٌ: (Sh,
T:) and pleasing talk and jesting of a man with
his wife: (TA in art. سمت:) and also, (Kudot;,)
accord. to A'Obeyd (T, S) and Hr, (M,) like
هَدْىٌ, (K,) or nearly the same as this word,
(T, S, M,) both signifying a certain calm or
placid or grave manner of deportment, with
pleasingness of mien or guise or aspect, (T, S, M,
K,) and of the natural dispositions &c., (T, S,)
of a man: (T, S, M:) and boldness [or presumptuousness]; (T in art. دلو;) as also ↓ دَلَالٌ
and ↓ دَالَّةٌ: (Mgh, and Har p. 243, and T ubi
suprà in explanation of the last:) or this last
signifies a kind of boldness (IAar, T, M, * K *)
towards a person in whose estimation one holds a
high place, (IAar, T,) or towards a person beloved, or a beloved and loving relation; (M, K;)
and is a subst. from أَدَلَّ; (S;) syn. with إِدْلَالٌ;
(Har p. 243;) as is also ↓ دِلَّةٌ. (Fr, T.) One
says, هِىَ حَسَنَةُ الدَّلِّ and ↓ الدَّلَالِ [She is pleasing
in respect of her amorous gesture &c.]. (S.)
-A2-  It is also an arabicized word, from the Pers.
دِلْ signifying The heart, or mind: (M, K:)
sometimes used in the speech of the Arabs, (M,)
and applied by them as a proper name (M, K,)
to a woman: (M:) with fet-h (M, K) and
teshdeed (K) because there is no such word in
their language as دِلٌّ; wherefore they changed it
to دَلٌّ, which has the first of the meanings assigned
to it above. (M.)
[
دَلَّةٌ, to which Golius assigns a meaning partly
belonging to دَلْدَلَةٌ, an inf. n. of دَلْدَلَ, and partly
to other words of this art, (“ Capitis membrorumve motus seu gestus, extrinsecus gravitatem
præ se ferens, profectus tamen ab eo qui amat
favetque,”) as on the authority of the K and KL,
I do not find in either of those works.]
دُلَّةٌ A favour, or benefit, conferred, or bestowed.
(Fr, T.)
دِلَّةٌ: see دَلٌّ.
دَلَالٌ: see دَلٌّ, in five places.
دَلِيلٌ i. q. ↓ دَالٌّ; (S, Msb, TA;) i.e.[A director; or] a right director (Msb, Kull, TA) to
that which is sought or desired; a guide; (Kull;)
one who directs, or rightly directs, another; (M;)

a thing by which one is directed, or guided,
(مَا يُسْتَدَلُّ بِهِ S, TA,) or by which one is rightly
directed; (TA;) [an indication; an evidence; a
proof; and an argument;] a sign set up for the
knowledge of a thing indicated; (whence smoke
is called دَلِيلٌ عَلَى النَّارِ [an indication of fire];)
anything whereby a thing indicated is known,
whether relating to an object of sense or to the
law [&c.], decisive or indecisive: and ↓ دَلَالَةٌ is
used in the sense of دَلِيلٌ, because a thing is
called by the inf. n. of its verb: (Kull:) and so is
↓ دِلِّيلَى, (S, MF, TA,) though this is asserted in
the K to have been said heedlessly by J because
this last word is an inf. n.; for the inf. n. is used
in the sense of the act. part. n., almost by a
general rule, as it is also in the sense of the pass.
part. n.: (MF, TA:) the pl. of دَلِيلٌ is أَدِلَّآءُ
[generally restricted to rational beings, or always
so restricted,] and أَدِلَّةٌ [generally restricted to
things by which one is directed &c., but properly
a pl. of pauc.,] (M, TA) and, accord. to some,
دَلَائِلُ, (Kull,) or this is pl. of ↓ دَلِيلَةٌ [fem. of
دَلِيلٌ, or of ↓ دَلَالَةٌ, as is also دَلَالَاتٌ. (TA.)
يَا دَلِيلَ المُتَحَيِّرِينَ means O guide of those who
are perplexed to that by means of which their
perplexity will depart. (Kull.) The saying of a
poet,
شَدُّوا المَطَى عَلَى دَلِيلٍ دَائِبِ
means, as some say, بِدَلِيلٍ [i.e. They bound the
saddles upon the camels for riding, with, or by
means of, a toiling guide]: or, accord. to IJ, it
may be elliptical, for عَلَىدِلَالَةِ دَلِيلٍ, and is like
the phrase سِرْ عَلَى اسْمِ اللّٰهِ; as though he said,
مُعْتَمِدِينَ عَلَى دَلِيلٍ دَائِبِ [relying upon a toiling
guide]. (M.)
دَلَالَةٌ: see the next paragraph, in four places;
and see its pl. in the same: ―
-b2-  see also دَلِيلٌ, in two
places. ―
-b3-  As a conventional term, (TA,) it means
A word's signification, or indication of meaning:
(Msb, TA:) this is of three kinds: thus إِنْسَانٌ

with reason ” بِالتَّضَمُّنِ, i. e. [by partial inclusion,
or] partially; and “ a being capable of knowledge ” بِالِالْتِزَامِ, i. e. [necessarily, or] by a necessary idea attached to it in the mind. (TA.)
دِلَالَةٌ a subst. signifying Direction, right direction, or guidance; (Fr, T, M, Msb;) as also
↓ دَلَالَةٌ, (Fr, T, Msb,) or the former only accord.
to IDrd, (M,) and ↓ دُلُولَةٌ and ↓ دِلِّلَيلَى; (M;) or
this last is an inf. n. like ↓ دَلَالَةٌ; (K;) or signifies
the skill of a guide in direction or right direction
or guidance; his well-grounded skill therein.
(Sb, M, K.) A poet says,
إِنِّى امْرَأٌ بِالطُّرْقِ ذُو دَلَالَاتْ
[Verily I am a man possessing varied skill in
guiding in the roads, or ways]. (A'Obeyd, S.)
―
-b2-  The occupation of the دَلَّال [q. v.]; (M, K;)
as also ↓ دَلَالَةٌ: (K:) or, accord. to IDrd, the
latter [only] has this meaning. (M.) ―
-b3-  The
hire that one gives to the دَلِيل, or [so in the M,
but in the K “ and ”] to the دَلَّال: (M, K:) and
so, sometimes, ↓ دَلَالَةٌ. (K.)

called سِمْسَارٌ; (TA in art. سمسر;) one who brings
together the seller and the buyer. (M, K.)
دِلِّيلَى: see دَلِيلٌ: ―

people, or party, wavering, vacillating, or hanging in suspense, between two affairs, and not
pursuing a direct course. (Lh, T, K.) You say

not inclining to these nor to those. (ISk, T, S.)
-A2-  دُلْدُلٌ also signifies A case, or an affair, of
great magnitude or moment, difficult, or formidable. (K.) You say, وَقَعَ القَوْمُ فِى الدَّلْدُلِ [The

male قنفذ: (MF:) or an animal like the قنفذ;
(M, K;) it is a certain beast that shakes, and
shoots forth prickles like arrows: the difference

and جِرْذَانْ, and the ox-kind and buffaloes, and
Arabian camels and those called بَخَاتِىّ: (M:)
or a certain large thing, larger than the قنفذ,
