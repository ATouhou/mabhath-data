مسح1
مَسَحَ شَيْئًا, aor.
مَسَحَ, inf. n. مَسْحٌ; and ↓ مسّحهُ,
inf. n تَمْسِيحٌ; He wiped a thing that was wet
or dirty, with his hand, or passed his hand over
it to remove the wet or dirt that was upon it:
(L:) مَسْحٌ and تَمْسِيحٌ and ↓ تَمَسُّحٌ signifying
the passing the hand over a thing that is flowing
[with water or the like], or dirtied, soiled, or
polluted, to remove the fluid or dirt, or soil or
pollution; (L, K;) as when one wipes his head
with his hand to remove water; and his forehead, to remove sweat. (L.) [It often signifies
He stroked a thing with his hand; as, for
instance, the Black Stone of the Kaabeh; see
below.] ―
-b2-  مَسَحَ رَأْسَهُ مِنَ المَآءِ; and جَبِينَهُ
الرَّشَحِ; He wiped his head with his hand to
remove the water that was upon it; and his
forehead to remove the sweat. (L.) ―
-b3-  مَسَحَ بِرَأْسِهِ
(S) He wiped with his hand, or passed his hand
closely over, his head, or a part thereof, without
making any water to flow upon it: so in the
Kur, v. 8; where it is said, فَاغْسِلُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ
وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ إِلَى الْمَرَافِقِ وَامْسَحُوا بِرُؤُوسِكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ
إِلَى الْكَعْبَيْنِ: here أَرْجُلَكُمْ is in the acc. case as
an adjunct to ايديكم; [i.e., as a third objective
complement to the verb اغسلوا; not as an adjunct
to رؤوسكم;] but some read أَرْجُلِكُمْ, putting it in
the gen. case because of its proximity to رؤوسكم;
(Jel;) [in like manner as خَرِبٍ is put in the gen.
case in the phrase هٰذَا جُحْرُ ضَبٍّ خَرِبٍ, an ex.
given by many of the grammarians, showing
that this is allowable in prose,] notwithstanding
that it is said, by Aboo-Is-hák the grammarian,
that the putting a noun in the gen. case because
of its proximity to a preceding noun in that case
is not allowable except in poetry, when necessity
requires it: (L:) the head, which is wiped, is
mentioned between the arms and the feet, which
are washed, to show the order which is to be
observed in the purification. (Jel.) But مَسَحَ
signifies both he wiped with the hand, and also
he washed: so says IAth: (L:) and AZ and
IKt say the like: (Msb:) you say مَسَحْتُ يَدَىَّ
بالمَآءِ, meaning I washed my hands with water.
(AZ, Msb.) ―

here meant is the wiping with the hand wetted
with water: accord. to IAth, Solomon is here
said to have smitten the necks and hock-tendons
