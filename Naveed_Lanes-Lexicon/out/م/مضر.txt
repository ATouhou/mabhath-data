-A2-  It is said, of the
race of مُضَر, in a trad., مضّرها اللّٰه فِى النَّارِ,
meaning, May God make them to be in the fire
[of hell]; the verb being derived from their
name: (TA:) or may God collect them together
[therein]; like as one says جَنَّدَ الجُنُودَ: (Z,
TA:) or destroy them; (K;) from the saying
ذَهَبَ دَمُهُ خِضْرًا مِضْرًا, in the first of the senses
explained below: (TA:) J says, [in the S,]
that its origin seems to be from مُضُورُ اللَّبَنِ,
meaning “ the biting of the tongue by milk,”
and that it is with teshdeed to denote muchness,
or intensiveness. (TA.)

↓ مَضِرًا, (K,) His blood went unrevenged, or unretaliated, or unexpiated by a mulct: (S, K:)

thick; and sometimes they mix fresh milk with
milk that has been collected in a skin; and in this
case it is the best that can be. (AM, TA.)
مَاضِرٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ مَضِيرٌ (A, Msb, K)
and ↓ مَضِرٌ, (IAar, K,) the last thought by ISd
to be a kind of relative or possessive epithet,
because the verb is مَضَرَ, (TA,) [but it seems
that he was unacquainted with, or that he disallowed, the form مَضِرَ, of which it is the regular
part. n.,] Milk that is sour, or acid, (A, Msb,)
biting the tongue: (A:) or such as bites the
