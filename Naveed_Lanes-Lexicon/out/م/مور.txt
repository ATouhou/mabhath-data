or spirit, was blown into Adam, مَارَ فِى رَأْسِهِ فَعَطَسَ

and he sneezed. (TA.) And in the Kur, [lii. 9,]
يَوْمَ تَمُورُ السَّمَآءُ مَوْرًا On the day when the heaven
shall actually be in a state of commotion, or
tumult: so accord. to Ed-Dahhák: or shall move
from side to side: so accord. to AO and Akh:

or reel. (T.) And in a trad. of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr,

the locust, by reason of their multitude. (TA.)
You say also, مَارَتِ النَّاقَةُ فِى سَيْرِهَا The she-camel
was in a state of commotion, and reeled, in her
pace, or going: and in like manner you say of a
