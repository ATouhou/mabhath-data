A, K,) (tropical:)  I ate with such a one. (S, A, K.)
Abu-l-Kásim Er-Zejjájee disapproves of this,
saying that a verb of this form is only derived
from an inf. n., as in the cases of ضَارَبَ and
قَاتَلَ; whereas this is derived from مِلْحٌ, a subst.
[But his objection seems to me invalid: this
may be an anomalous instance, and yet of classical authority, like many others.] ―

it by الرَّضَاعُ, as is mentioned in the TA: المُمَالَحَةُ
is explained in the A, Mgh, L, and other lexicons
by المُرَاضَعَةُ: in the copies of the K in my
hands, by الرَّضَاعُ; and so in one copy of the S:
in another copy of the S written الرِّضَاعُ; and in
another الرّضَاع, without any vowel to the ر:
الرضَاعُ, syn. with المُرَاضَعَةُ, is evidently the
right reading.] Abu-l-Kásim Er-Zejjájee disapproves of the verb used as signifying the
act of two men's sucking each other; [but this
is not what is meant by المراضعة;] and pronounces it a post-classical word. (TA.) You
say بَيْنَهُمَا حُرْمَةُ المُمَالَحَةِ Between them two is
the sacred or inviolable bond, or obligation,
which is the consequence of their being fosterbrothers. (A.)

أَمْلَحَ See 1, in four places, and 2. ―

مَا أَمَيْلِحَ زَيْدًا (tropical:)  [How very goodly, or beautiful,
or pretty, is Zeyd! a diminutive form, meant
to denote the contrary of the sense of a dim.,
being what is termed تَصْغِيرُ تَعْظِيمٍ, from
مَا أَمْلَحَهُ:] (T, S, K:) the verb is here put
into the dim. form, being meant to be used as
an epithet, as though they said مُلَيْحٌ: (T:)
it is the only instance of a verb put into this
form, except مَا أُحَيْسِنَهُ, (S, K,) and, as some
say, مَا أُحَيْلَاهُ. (TA.) This is said accord. to
the doctrine of the Basrees, who assert the افعل
of wonder to be a verb: but as to the Koofees,
who say that it is a noun, [meaning an epithet,]
they allow the formation of the dim. from it
without restriction; and from its admitting the
dim. form, they argue that it is a noun. (MF.)
―

sucking the mother or any nurse; syn. رَضَاعٌ; (S,
M, K;) a child's sucking its mother. (Abu-l-
Kásim Ez-Zejjájee.) ―
-b2-  مِلْحٌ (tropical:)  Milk. (IAar.)
The following verse of Abu-t-Tamahán, who had
some camels, of the milk whereof he gave to drink
to a people that afterwards made an attack upon
them, and took them, is cited by As, [app., accord.
to the S, as an ex. of ملح in the sense of رَضَاع;
but as MF observes, it may be taken as an ex. of
that word in the sense of milk;]
وِإِنِّى لَأَرْجُو مِلْحَهَا فِى بُطُونِكُمْ
وَمَا بَسَطَتْ مِنْ جِلدِ أَشْعَثَ أَغْبَرَا
(S, L.) The poet says, Verily I hope that ye
may regard (أَنْ تَرْعَوْا [which is understood]) the
milk which ye have drank, of these camels, [lit.,
their milk in your bellies,] and the skins which
they have expanded, of a people with matted and
dusty hair, and of a dusty hue; as though their
skins had dried up, and they had fattened upon
them. [Another explanation will be noticed
below.] IB says, that the last word should be
read أَغْبَرِ, for the sake of the rhyme; for each
verse of the poem to which it belongs ends with
kesreh. (L.)
-A2-  مِلْحٌ a thing well known, (S,
K,) [Salt;] that with which food is made pleasant:
(L:) of the fem. gender (Z) generally; (O;)
sometimes masc.: (K:) pl. مِلَاحٌ. (Msb.) Dim.
مُلَيْحَةٌ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  مَآءٌ مِلْحٌ, (S, K, &c.,) originally ↓ مَلِحْ, from the verb مَلُحَ, like خَشِنٌ from
خَشُنَ, contracted because of the frequency of its
usage; (Msb;) and ↓ ماء مَلِيحٌ, (K,) and ↓ مَالِحٌ;
(IAar, ADk, Az;) [respecting which last, see
what will be found after the explanation;] Salt
water. (S, K, &c.) J says, that مَاء مالح is not
allowable, except in a bad dial.: but Az says,
that, though rarely found in the language of the
Arabs, it is not to be rejected; and IB says, that
it occurs in verses of chaste poets; and may be
considered as used after the manner of a rel. n.,
[meaning ذُو مِلْحٍ,] like رَجُلٌ تَارِسٌ, i. e. ذُو تُرْسٍ,
and دَارِعٌ, i. e. ذُو دِرْعٍ: (TA:) it is a chaste word,
of the dial. of El-Hijáz, but extr., being from
أَمْلَحَ المَآءُ, like as you say بَاقِلٌ from أَبْقَلَ المَوْضِعُ;
and when it is said that it is rare, it is meant that
it is not agreeable with its verb, not that it is rare
with respect to usage, seeing that it is of the dial.
of the people of El-Hijáz, who selected the most
chaste words of the various dialects: or it is
regularly formed from مَلَحَ المَأءُ, a form of the
verb sometimes used. (Msb.) The pl. of مِلْحٌ is
مِلْحَةٌ and مِلَاحٌ and مِلَحٌ: (L, K:) and sometimes is said أَمْوَاهٌ مِلْحٌ salt waters; and رَكِيَّةٌ مِلْحَةٌ
a salt well. (L.) ―
-b3-  مِلَاحٌ Salt waters. (T, K.)
↓ قَلِيبٌ مَليِحٌ A well of salt water: (S, K:) pl.
أَقْلِبَةٌ مِلَاحٌ, occurring in a verse of 'Antarah. (S.)
―
-b4-  مِلْحٌ (assumed tropical:)  Knowledge; science; learning; syn.
عِلْمٌ. (IKh, Kz, K.) ―
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  Men of science; learned
men; syn. عُلَمَآءُ. (IKh, Kz, K.) ―
-b6-  (tropical:)  Goodliness,
or beauty. (K.) [Accord. to the TA, it is an
inf. n.: see مَلُحَ.] ―
-b7-  (tropical:)  Fat, as a subst. (Sh, K.) ―
-b8-
(tropical:)  Fatness: (K:) or a small degree of fatness. (TA.)
―
-b9-  مِلْحٌ and ↓ مِلْحَةٌ (tropical:)  A sacred or inviolable
bond, or the like, or any compact, bond, or obligation, which one is under an obligation to respect,
or honour, or the cancelling or breaking of which
renders one obnoxious to blame; syn. حُرْمَةٌ and
ذِمَامٌ; and a compact, or confederacy; syn. حِلْفٌ.
(K.) In some copies of the K, for حِلْفٌ is put
حَلفٌ. (TA.) ―
-b10-  Accord. to Aboo-Sa'eed, this
is the signification of the former word in the verse
of Abu-t-Tamahán cited above, and the poet
means, I hope that God may punish you for your
perfidious violation of the sacred obligation to
their owner, which they imposed upon you. You
say بَيْنَ فُلَانٍ وَفُلَانٍ مِلْحٌ, and ↓ مِلْحَةٌ, There is
a sacred or inviolable bond, &c., between such
a one and such a one. [This meaning is
derived from مِلْحٌ as signifying “ salt; ” the
eating of which with another imposes upon the
two parties a sacred mutual obligation.] The
Arabs, says Abu-l-'Abbás, pay a high respect
to salt and fire and ashes. (L.) [You say,]
مِلْحُهُ عَلَى رُكْبَتِهِ, so in the copies of the K,
but correctly على رُكْبَتَيْهِ, as in all the other
lexicons, (TA,) (tropical:)  [lit., His salt is upon his knees;]
meaning he has no good faith, so as to fulfil his
promises, or engagements: (K:) or he has little
good faith, so as to fulfil his promises, &c., for the
Arabs swear by salt, and by water, because of
their respect for them: (IAar:) or he violates the
obligation imposed by such, the smallest thing
making him forget it, like as the least thing
scatters salt if a person puts it upon his knees:
(T:) or he is fat: (K:) As says, that in the
following verse,
لَا تَلُمْهَا إِنَّهَا مِنْ نِسْوَةٍ
مِلْحُهَا مَوْضُوعَةٌ فَوْقَ الرُّكَبْ
[Blame her not; for she is of women whose fat is
placed above the knees;] the woman meant was
of the people called Ez-Zenj, whose fat is in their
thighs, and ملحها signifies their fat: (TA:) or
he is sharp in his anger: (K:) or he is of evil
disposition, rendered angry by the least thing;
like as salt upon the knee is scattered by the least
thing: (T:) or he is frequently engaged in altercation; as though his knees were much wounded
by his long kneeling in altercation, and by his
long striking his knees against those of another,
and he therefore put salt upon them to cure them.
(A.) [See also رُكْبَةٌ.]

intermixed with black: (S, K:) whiteness overspreading blackness in the human hair, and in
anything: or a dusty white colour: or a clear
white colour: or whiteness inclining to any kind
of redness; like the colour of the antelope. (L.)
[See also أَمْلَحُ.] ―
-b2-  Also, مُلْحَةٌ (tropical:)  The utmost
degree of blueness or grayness, [app. meaning the
latter, from مِلْحٌ as signifying “ salt,” as salt in
the state in which it is commonly used in Arabia
is of a pale gray colour,] أَشَدُّ الزَّرقِ: (K:) or
blueness, or grayness, (زُرْقَة,) of such a degree as
to incline to whiteness. (S.) [See أَمْلَحُ.] ―

so ↓ أُمْلُوحَةٌ, coupled with أُفْكُوهَةٌ in art. فكه in
the TA:] also said to signify a bad, an abominable, or a foul, word, saying, or speech; a meaning
taken from a trad. of 'Áïsheh, who applied this
term [perhaps ironically] to a bad answer which
she had given in consequence of her having misunderstood a question put to her: (L:) pl. مُلَحٌ.
(S, K.) As said نِلْتُ بِالمُلَحِ [I have attained
to the station, or rank, to which I have attained
by means of goodly, or facetious, sayings, &c.]
(S.) حَدَّثْتُهُ بِالمُلَحِ (tropical:)  [I related to him goodly,
beautiful, pretty, or facetious, stories.] (A.) ―
