مغص1
مَغڤصَ [مَغَصَهُ, inf. n. مَغْصٌ, He pierced him with a
spear or the like: for] مَغْصٌ is syn. with طَعْنٌ;
as also مَغْسٌ. (TA.)
-A2-  [Hence, perhaps,] مُغِصَ,
(ISk, S, Msb, K,) [of which مَغْصٌ, which see
below, is app. the inf. n.] and مَغِصَ, (A, Msb,
[in a copy of the former of which, instead of the
former verb, I find مَغُصَ, but this is probably a
mistranscription,]) inf. n. مَغَصٌ; (Msb;) He (a
man, S, Msb,) had what is termed مَغْصٌ as
explained below; (ISk, S, A, Msb, K;) as also
مُغِسَ and مَغِسَ: (IKoot, Msb:) and مَعِصَ:
(TA:) [it is most commonly with غ and ص;
but Z says, that] the original word is with س,
from مَغَسَهُ signifying طَعَنَهُ. (A.)

تمغّص بَطْنِى, and تَمَغَّصَنِى, My belly pained
me; as also تمغّس, with س. (TA.) [In the
CK, we find تمغّص بَطْنَهُ, explained by أَوْجَعَهُ,
as though signifying It pained his belly: but
بَطْنَهُ is doubtless a mistake for بَطْنُهُ. In MS.
copies of the K, I do not find this verb.] ―
-b2-  And
[hence,] تَمَغَّصَنِى الشَّىْءُ (assumed tropical:)  The thing hurt me:
and in like manner, تَمَغَّصْتُ مِنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  [I was hurt
by it]. (TA.)
مَغْصٌ (ISk, S, A, Msb, K) and مَغَصٌ; (IDr,
A, K;) but the former is the chaste word;
(A;) or the latter, accord. to ISk, is vulgar,
(S,) and Az pronounces him right in saying so,
(Msb,) and Yaakoob disallows the latter word.
wherefore the author of the K is wrong in imputing error, in this matter, [if error it be,] to J;
(TA;) [Colic; or] pain in the belly, (A, K,)
and griping (تَقْطِيعٌ) in the bowels; (A;) or
griping (تقطيع) in the bowels, and pain [therein];
(S;) or pain in the bowels, and contortion [therein]; (Msb;) as also مَغْسٌ. (Yaakoob, TA.)
مَمْغُوصٌ A man (S, Msb) having what is
termed مَغْصٌ as explained above. (S, Msb, K.)
