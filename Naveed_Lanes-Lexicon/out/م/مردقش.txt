مردقشمَرْدَقُوشٌ [Marjoram; sweet marjoram; so
called in the present day;] i. q. مَرْزَنْجُوشٌ [q. v.]:
(S, K:) an arabicized word, (AHeyth, K,)
[thought to be so by J,] from [the Persian]
مُرْدَهْ كُوشْ, (K) meaning “ having a dead ear,”
(TA,) or “ having a soft ear,” [which is given
in the K as one of the significations of the
arabicized word,] (AHeyth, TA,) because what
is flaccid is as though it were dead: (TA:) or
[so accord. to the S, TA; but accord. to the K,
and] saffron: (S, K:) and a certain perfume
which a woman puts upon her comb, inclining to
redness and blackness. (K.) The vulgar [generally] say بَرْدَقُوش. (TA.)
