موزمَوْزٌ A certain kind of tree, (Mgh,) or fruit,
(Msb, K,) well known; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) [the
fruit of the banana-tree, or musa paradisiaca;]
i. q. طَلْحٌ [in one of the acceptations of this latter
word]: (Msb:) it is lenitive, diuretic, provocative
of venery, and augments the spermatic fluid and
the phlegm and the yellow bile, and the eating
much of it is very oppressive, (K,) for it is slow
of digestion: (TA:) the tree grows in the manner
of the بَرْدِىّ, [i. e., papyrus, or perhaps other
rushes,] and has a long and broad leaf, which may
be three cubits by two cubits, (AHn, Mgh, TA,)
the مَوْز [i. e., the fruit] is found, where it grows,
throughout the whole year, (AHn, as cited by
'Abd-El-Lateef,) and there may be on one of its
racemes from thirty to five hundred fruits; (AHn,
Mgh, K, TA;) this is seen in the districts of
Makdishoo [between Abyssinia and the country
of the Zenj]; (TA;) and when this is the case,
the raceme is propped up; (AHn, Mgh;) it rises
to the height of the stature of a man, [and higher,]
and its offsets continually grow around it, every
one of them smaller than another; and when it
has produced its fruit, the mother-tree is cut down
at the foot, and its offset that has attained to its
height fructifies, and becomes a mother, the rest
remaining its offsets, and thus it continues: whence
the saying of Ash'ab, to his son, as related by As,
Wherefore dost thou not become like me? to
which he answered, Such as I is like the مَوْزَة,
which does not attain to a good state until its
mother dies. (AHn, TA.) مَوْزَةٌ is the n. un.
(S, Msb.)
مَوَّازٌ A seller of مَوْز [or fruit of the bananatree]. (K.)
