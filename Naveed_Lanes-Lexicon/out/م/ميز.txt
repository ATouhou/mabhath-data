ميز1
مَازَهُ, aor. يَمِيزُهُ, inf. n. مَيْزٌ; (S, A, Msb,
K;) and ↓ ميّزهُ (S, K,) inf. n. تَمْيِيزٌ; (S;) or
the latter has an intensive signification; (Msb;)
He put it, or set it, apart, away, or aside;
removed it; or separated it; (S, A, Msb, K;)
from another thing, or other things; (Msb;) as
also ↓ امازهُ: (K:) [or the second, rather, he did
so much, or greatly, or widely; like زَيَّلَهُ.] You
say, مَازَهُ مِنْهُ, and ↓ ميّزهُ. (A.) Ex. مَازَ الأَذَى
مِنَ الطَّرِّيق He put aside, or removed, what
was hurtful from the road. (TA.) And it is
said in the Kur, [viii. 38,] لِيَمِيزَ اللّٰهُ الخَبِيثَ
مِنَ الطَّيِّبِ [That God may separate, or sever,
the evil from the good]. (Msb.) [It seems also,
from what is said in the A, that مَايَزْتُ بَيْنَهُمَا
signifies I separated them two: besides having
another signification, which see below.] You
say also مَازَ الشَّىْءَ, (aor. and inf. n. as above,
TA,) meaning, He separated one part of the
thing from another; فَصَلَ بَعْضَهُ مِنْ بَعْضٍ, (M,
TA,) or عَنْ بَعْضٍ: (as in a copy of the A:)
expl. in the K as signifying فَضَّلَ بَعْضَهُ عَلَى بَعْضٍ
[he judged, or made, part of the thing to excel,
or to have excelled, another]; but the explanation
in the M is the right. (TA.) And الأَشْيَآءَ ↓ ميّز
He separated the things after knowledge of them.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, He distinguished it, or discriminated it, or discerned it. And مَازَ بَيْنَ
الأَشْيَآءِ, and بَيْنَهَا ↓ مَيَّزَ, He distinguished, or discriminated, or discerned, between the things.
This is what is meant by its being said,] المَيْزُ
also signifies التَّمْيِيزُ بَيْنَ الأَشْيَآءِ. (TA.) You say
also, بَيْنَهُمَا ↓ مَايَزْتُ [I distinguished, or discriminated, or discerned, between them two]. (A.)
From ميّز الاشيآء, meaning as explained above,
is [also], app., derived the phrase سِنُّ التَّمْيِيزِ, used
by the doctors of practical law, as signifying,
[The age of discrimination;] the age at which
one knows what things are beneficial to him and
what are hurtful to him: or, accord. to some,
التَّمْيِيز is a faculty in the brain whereby meanings
are elicited. (Msb.)
-A2-  مَازَ [is also intrans.,
and signifies] He (a man) removed from one
place to another. (IAar, K.) See also 8.

امتاز, and ↓ تميّز, (S, A, Msb, K,) and
↓ انماز. (S, A, K,) and ↓ إِمَّازَ, (Lh, TA,) [the
last being a variation of that immediately preceding,] and ↓ استماز, (S, A, K,) It was, or
became, put, or set, apart, away, or aside; or
removed; or separated; (S, A, * Msb, * K;)
from another thing, or other things: (Msb:)
and the last, ↓ استماز, he went, or withdrew,
aside, or to a distance, (K, TA,) عَنِ الشَّىْءِ
from the thing. (TA.) All these forms are
syn.; but in the phrase مِزْتُهُ فَلَمْ يَمَّزْ [as though
signifying I put it, or set it, apart, &c., but it
did not remain so] Lh allows the verbs to be
only in these two forms: (TA:) [though ↓ انماز
is used in other cases; for] you say عَنْ ↓ انماز
مُصَلَّاهُ He shifted from his place of prayer; or
quitted it for another. (TA.) [See also 1, last
signification.] You say also, امتار القَوْمُ, meaning, بَعْضُهُمْ مِنْ بَعْضٍ ↓ تميّز [The people were,
or became, put, or set, apart, &c., one from
another]: (S, TA:) and, as also ↓ تميّزوا, they
became on one side: or they became alone, or
separate: and the former, they withdrew, in a
company or troop, aside; as also ↓ استمازوا:
(TA:) and [in like manner] ↓ تمايزوا they became
separated: (A:) and they formed themselves into
separate companies, or troops, and went away,
one from another. (TA. [التَّمَايُزُ being there
said to signify التَّحَزُّبُ وَالتَّنَافُرُ.]) ―
-b2-  [امتاز, and
the other forms mentioned above, in the first
sentence of the paragraph, as syn. with it, also
signify It was, or became, distinguished, or discriminated, or discerned: in which sense, ↓ تميّز
is the most common. You say also, فُلَانٌ ↓ تميّز
بِالْكَرَمِ Such a one was, or became, distinguished
by generosity. And الأَشْيَآءُ ↓ تَمَايَزَتِ and ↓ تُمَيَّزَت
The things were, or became, distinguished, or discriminated, one from another; or distinct.]
