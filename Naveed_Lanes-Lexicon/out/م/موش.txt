موشمَاشٌ [Indian peas;] a certain grain, well
known, (S in art. ميش, and K,) round, smaller
than the حِمَّص [or chick-pea], of a tawny colour
inclining to greenness; it is in Syria and India;
and is sown; (TA;) also called مَجٌّ and خُلَّرٌ
and زِنٌّ: (TA, art. مج:) it is of moderate
temperature; and the mixture made thereof is
commended, being beneficial to him who is
fevered, and him who is affected with rheum;
it is lenitive; and when cooked with vinegar,
it is beneficial for purulent pustulous mange
or scab; and an external application thereof
strengthens feeble limbs: (K:) the word is
arabicized [from the Persian مَاشْ], or postclassical. (S.)
-A2-  Utensils and furniture, of the
meaner sort, of a house or tent. (IAar, K.)
Hence the saying, المَاشُ خَيْرٌ مِنْ لَاشَ, [in one
copy of the K I find لَاشٍ, but the former seems
to be the right reading,] meaning, Mean house-
hold utensils and furniture are better than
nothing; or] what is in the house, or tent, of
worthless utensils and furniture, is better than its
being empty: (K, TA:) لاش is here contracted
[from لَاشَىْءَ] for the sake of its resembling ماش.
(TA.) And خَاشَ مَاشَ and خَاشِ مَاشِ signify
the same as مَاشٌ thus used: (K, TA in art.
خوش:) or the refuse, or meanest sort, of people,
or of mankind; as in the M. (TA.)
موص &c.
