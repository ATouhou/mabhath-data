مكس1
مَكَسَ, aor.
مَكِسَ, (TK,) inf. n. مَكْسٌ, (Sh, A, K,)
He diminished, or deducted from, a thing; (Sh, *
A, * K, * TK;) syn. of the inf. n. تَقْصٌ. (Sh, A,
K.) Thus Sh explains مَكْس in the saying of
Jábir Ibn-Jinnee Et-Taghlibee:
أَفِى كُلِّ أَسْوَاقِ العِرَاقِ إِتَاوَةٌ
وَفِى كُلِّ مَا بَاعَ امْرُؤٌ مَكْسُ دِرْهَمِ
[Is there bribing in every one of the markets of
El-'Irák, and in the case of everything that a man
has sold the deducting of a dirhem?]. (TA.)
[Hence,] you say, مَكَسَ فِى البَيْعِ, aor. and inf. n.
as above; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) and ↓ ماكس, inf.
n. مُمَاكَسَةٌ and مِكَاسٌ: (S, Mgh, Msb:) both
signify He diminished, or deducted from, the price
in the selling, or buying: (Msb:) or both signify
he desired, or demanded, a diminution of, or deduction from, the price in selling or buying: (Mgh,
TA, *) or the former signifies he collected property
in selling or buying: (K: [but from what I find
in the other lexicons, I think it probable that an
early copyist has perverted the text of the K here
by making a transposition; writing مَكَسَ فِى البَيْعِ
يَمْكِسُ مَكْسًا جَبَى مَالًا واَلمَكْسُ النَّقْصُ وَالظُّلْمُ for
مَكَسَ يَمْكِسُ مَكْسًا جَبَى مَالًا وَالمَكْسُ فى البَيْعِ النَّقْصُ
وَالظُّلْمُ: in the TK we find جنى مالا, which is
certainly a mistake:]) or مَكْسٌ signifies the
diminishing (إِنْتِقَاص) of the price of a commodity:
(M, TA:) and ↓ مِكَاسٌ, the acting with mutual
niggardliness in bargaining; or, accord. to EshShereeshee, the vying in acuteness between a seller
and buyer, the former demanding a price and the
latter offering less, time after time, until they agree
to a reduced price. (Har, p. 586.) You say also,
مُكِسَ, meaning, He (a man) suffered a diminution,
or deduction, in selling or buying and the like.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, perhaps, or the reverse may
be the case,] He wronged a man; treated him, or
used him, wrongfully, injuriously, or tyrannically.
(A, * K, * TK. [In the first and second, only
the inf. n. of the verb in this sense is mentioned.])
―
-b3-  [Hence, also, app.,] He (the مَكَّاس, Mgh,
Msb) collected a tax; syn. جَبَى; [particularly,
the tax termed مَكْس:] (S, * M, Mgh, * Msb [in
the first and third of which, only the inf. n. of the
verb in this sense is mentioned:]) or he collected
property. (A.) Hence the saying, (Mgh,) in a
trad., (S,) لَا يَدْجُلُ صَاحِبُ مَكْسٍ الجَنَّةَ (S, Mgh)
[The taker of the tax termed مكس will not enter
paradise]; meaning, the عَشَّار. (TA.)

-b2-  ماكسهُ, (K,)

manner; syn. شَاحَّهُ: (K: but in some copies, شَاكَسَهُ.
TA,) or ماكسهُ فى البَيْعِ signifies he contended
with him [by bidding against him or otherwise]
in the sale. (MA.) [See, in art. كيس, voce

other, in bargaining: (IDrd, K:) or تماكسوا

مَكْسٌ, an inf. n., (see 1,) used as a subst.,
(Mgh, Msb,) Money that used to be taken from
the seller of commodities in the markets in the time
of ignorance: (IDrd, M, K:) and a dirhem
which the collector of the poor-rate used to take
after he had finished the receipt of that tribute:
(IAar, K:) or what is taken by the عَشَّار, (S,
Mgh,) or مَاكِس, (S,) or مَكَّاس: (Mgh, Msb:)
so [accord. to some] in the verse above cited:
(S:) the tax, or impost, which he used to take:
(TA:) and generally, what the Sultán's guards
take wrongfully on an occasion of buying and
selling: so [accord. to some] in the verse cited

put in the place of دَيْن, in both the above
instances; and مَلَآءٍ in that of مُلَأءَ; for Golius
