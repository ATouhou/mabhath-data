منذمُنْدُ is a simple word; (K;) or, accord. to some, a
compound word, as will be explained hereáfter:
(TA:) Sb says, that it is with respect to time like
مِنْ with respect to place: (S, L:) it is indecl.,
[generally] with damm for its termination; and مُذْ
is indecl. also, [generally] with its final letter quiescent, (S, L, K,) [unless followed by a quiescent
letter, when it is movent in different manners which
will be shown below,] and it is formed from مُنْذُ by
elision: (M, L, K:) منذ is also written and pronounced مِنْذُ, (M, L, K,) in the dial. of the
Benoo-Suleym; (M, L;) and مذ, مِذْ, (M, L,
K,) in the dial. of the tribe of 'Okl. (M, L.)
Each may be a prep., governing what follows it
in the gen. case, and used in the same manner as
فِى [signifying In, or during, or from the beginning of]: and in this case, each is prefixed only
to that which denotes present time: thus you say,
مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذُ اللَّيْلَةِ [I have not seen him in this
night; or simply I have not seen him this night]:
(S, L:) or each is followed by a noun in the gen.
case, and in this instance is a prep., in the sense
of مِنْ [meaning Since, or lit., from,] when
relating to a past time [such as a particular past
day or the like]; and in the sense of فِى [meaning
In, or from the beginning of,] when relating to
the present time; and in the sense of مِنْ and إِلَى
together [meaning From the beginning to the end
of; or during the whole course of; or simply
during, or for;] when relating to a computed
period of time, or number of days or the like: ex.
[relating to a past time,] مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُنْذُ يَوْمِ الخَمِيسِ
[I have not seen him since Thursday, إِلَى الْآنَ to
the present time]; (Mughnee, K;) and [relating
to the present time,] مُنْذُ يَوْمِنَا or عَامِنَا [in, or
from the beginning of, (this) our day, or (this)
our year;]; and, [relating to a computed period of
time, or number of days or the like,] مُنْذُ ثَلَاثَةِ أَيَّامٍ
[from the beginning to the end of, i. e., during, or
for, three days]. (Mughnee.) Each may also
be a noun, governing the noun which follows it
in the nom. case, as signifying a particular day
or the like, or as signifying a definite length of
time: in the case of a noun signifying a particular
day or the like, you say, مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْ يَوْمُ الجُمْعَةِ
[I have not seen him (since the commencement of
a space of time); the commencement of the space
of time thereof (i. e., أَوَّلُ مُدَّةِ عَدَمِ رُؤْيَتِى إِيَّاهُ the
commencement of the space of time of my not seeing
him) was Friday; meaning, since Friday]: and,
in the case of a noun signifying a definite length
of time, you say, مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْ سَنَةٌ, meaning, أَمَدُ
ذٰلِكَ سَنَةٌ, [I have not seen him (during, or for, a
time); the time thereof (i. e., أَمَدُ عَدَمِ رُؤْيَتِى إِيَّاهُ
the time of my not seeing him) is a year; meaning,
during, or for, a year;] and the noun in this
latter case can only be indeterminate; for you
cannot say, مُذْ سَنَةُ كَذَا: (S:) when followed
by a noun in the nom. case, as in the instance of
مُنْذُ يَوْمَانِ [or, accord. to more approved usage,
مُذْ يَوْمَانِ, as will be shown below, The time is
two days, meaning during, or for, two days], each
is an inchoative, and what follows it is an enunciative; and its meaning is the time with respect
to what is present, and to a computed period, or
a number of days or the like; and the commencement of the space of time with respect to a past
time [such as a particular past day or the like]:
or each is an adv. n. [of time], an enunciative, of
which what follows is the inchoative, and meaning
بَيْنَ وَبَيْنَ, as in the instance of لَقِيتُهُ مُنْذُ يَوْمَانِ,
[or, rather, مُذْ يَوْمَانِ,] i. e., بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَ لِقَائِهِ يَوْمَانِ
[Two days have been between the time in which I
now am and (the time of) my meeting him]: (K:)
but this opinion is rejected by Ibn-Hájib. (TA.)
Accord. to some of the Arabs, for they differ on
this point, مذ governs in the gen. case a noun
signifying a past time and one signifying a time
not past: and accord. to some of them, منذ
governs in the nom. case a noun signifying a past
time and one signifying a time not past: (M, L:)
but the general and most approved way is
to make مذ govern in the gen. case a noun signifying a time not past, and in the nom. case one
signifying a time past; and to make منذ govern
in the gen. case a noun signifying a time not past
and one signifying a time past: (T, M, L:) most
of the Arabs hold, that each must govern in the
gen. case a noun signifying the present time; and
that it is preferable to make منذ govern in the
same case, and to make مذ govern in the nom.
case, a noun signifying a past time: (Mughnee:)
[they therefore say, مُنْذُ اللَّيْلَةِ and مُذُ اللَّيْلَةِ, and
مُنْذُ يَوْمِ الخَمِيسِ and مُنْذُ يَوْمَينِ; but they say,
مُذْ يَوْمُ الخَمِيسِ and مُذْ يَوْمَانِ.] Some [or,
rather, most] say, لَمْ أَرَهُ مُذْ يَوْمَانِ, and لَمْ أَرَهُ مُنْذُ
يَوْمَينِ, [I have not seen him for, or during, two
days;] making مذ [in these instances] to govern
the nom. case; and منذ, the gen. case. (L.)
Such is said when the period of separation is a
day and part of a day. (Msb, art. شهر.) The
Benoo-Dabbeh and Er-Rabáb make مذ to govern
the gen. case in every instance. (M, L.) The
phrases, مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْ عَامٌ أَوَّلُ, and مُذْ عَامٌ أَوَّلَ, (S,
K, art. وأل; and L,) and مُذْ عَامُ الأَوَّلِ, and مُذْ
عَامًا أَوَّلَ, [I have not seen him since last year,] are
also mentioned by different authors. (L.) The
Arabs generally agree in pronouncing منذ with
damm to the ذ when it is followed by a movent or
a quiescent letter; (T, M, L;) as in لَمْ أَرَهُ مُنْذُ يَوْمٍ,
and مُنْذُ اليَوْمِ: (T, L:) and to pronounce مذ
with the ذ quiescent when it is followed by a
movent letter, (T, M, L,) and with damm and
[sometimes] with kesr when it is followed by a
conjunctive ا; (M, L;) as in لَمْ أَرَهُ مُذْ يَوْمَانِ,
and لَمْ أَرَهُ مُذُ اليَوْمِ, [and مُذِ اليَوْمِ]: (T, L:) and
so say most of the grammarians. (T.) Lh says,
The Benoo-'Obeyd, of the tribe of Ghanee, make
the ذ of مذ movent when it is followed by a
movent or a quiescent letter, and make the noun
following it to be in the nom. case, saying مُذُ اليَوْمُ;
and some of them pronounce it with kesr when
followed by a quiescent letter, saying مُذِ اليَوْمُ;
but this is not the proper way. (M, L.) In
the phrase مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذُ اليَوْمِ, the Arabs make the
ذ movent because of the occurrence [otherwise] of
two quiescent letters together; and they [generally]
give it not kesr, but damm, because the latter is
the final vowel of its original منذ. (M, L.)
One says also, مَا لَقِيتُةُ مُنْذَ اليَوْمِ, and مُذَ اليَوْمِ,
which fet-h to the ذ in each. (K.) The Benoo-Suleym are related to have used the expression مَا رَأَيْتُهُ
مِنْذُ سِتٌّ [by ستّ meaning six nights], with kesr
to the م of منذ, and with the noun following it in
the nom. case: and the tribe of 'Okl are related
to have used the expression مِذُ يَوْمَانِ, with the
ن elided, and with kesr to the م, and damm to
the ذ. (M, L.) ―
-b2-  Each of the two words منذ
and مذ is also followed by a verbal proposition,
as in the instance
مَا زَالَ مُذْ عَقَدَتْ يَدَاهُ إِزَازَهُ
[He has not ceased, since his two hands tied his
wrapper of the lower part of the body]: or a
nominal proposition, as in the instance
وَلَا زِلْتُ أَبْغِى المَالَ مُذْ أَنَا يَافِعٌ
[And I ceased not to seek wealth from the time
of my being a youth, or young man]: in such
cases, each is an adv. n. prefixed to the proposition
[and governing it virtually in the gen. case], or
to a noun significant of time [understood as] prefixed thereto [in the same manner]: or, as some
say, each is an inchoative. (K.) ―
-b3-  The original
of مذ is منذ, because they restore the dammeh
to the ذ in the case of the occurrence of two
quiescent letters together; as in the instance of
مُذُ اليَوْمِ, for were not its original with damm,
they would give it kesr: [but this some do, as
has been shown above:] and because its dim. is
مُنَيْذٌ: (K:) for when مذ is used as a proper
name of a man, its dim. is thus formed, by restoring the ن, that it may be of the measure
فُعَيْلٌ: (IJ, M, L:) or when مذ is a noun, it is
originally منذ; and when it is a particle, it is
itself original. (K.) ―
-b4-  Accord. to some, منذ
(T, S, L, K) and مذ (K) are originally مِنْ and إِذْ,
which are made one word, (T, S, L, K,) by
eliding the hemzeh, and then giving damm to the
ذ because of the occurrence of two quiescent letters
together; (K;) مُنْذُ كَانَ [and مُذْ كَانَ] meaning
مِنْ إِذْ كَانَ: (T, L:) but there is nothing to
indicate the truth of this opinion: (S, L:) or, as
some say, منذ and مذ are originally the prep.
من and ذو in the sense of الَّذِى (L, K) in the
dial. of Teiyi: so says Fr.; adding, that when
either governs a gen. case, it is used in the manner
of مَنْ; and when it governs a nom. case, it is
as though one said, [in using the expression
مُنْذُ أَوْ مُذْ يَوْمَانِ,] مِنَ الَّذِى هُوَ يَوْمَانِ; and that
the former government prevails in the case of منذ
because the ن is not suppressed: (L:) or, as
some say, they are originally مِنْ and the noun of
indication ذَا; so that in the phrase مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُنْذُ
يَوْمَانِ, [accord. to more approved usage, مُذْ يَوْمَانِ,]
we virtually say, مِنْ ذَا الْوَقْتِ يَوْمَانِ: but each
of these assertions is a deviation from the plain
way. (K.)
