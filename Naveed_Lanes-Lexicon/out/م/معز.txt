معز1
مَعِزَ الشَّىْءُ, [and مَعِزَتِ الأَرْضُ, accord. to
the explanation of the inf. n. in the S,] aor.
مَعَزَ,
(TK,) inf. n. مَعَزٌ, (S, K, TK,) The thing [and
the ground] was, or became, hard. (S, * K, * TK.)
-A2-  مَعِزَ said of a man: see 4.
-A3-  مَعَزْتُ المِعْزَى,
وَضَأَنْتُ الضَّأْنَ, aor.
مَعَزَ, I set apart the goats from
the sheep. (K.)
4
امعز He, (a man, A,) or it, (a people, S,)
became abundant in goats; his or its, goats became abundant, or numerous; (S, A, K;) as
also, ↓ مَعِزَ, aor.
مَعَزَ, (K,) inf. n. مَعَزٌ. (TK.)
مَعْزٌ, and ↓ مَعَزٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) gen. ns.,
(S, Msb,) [or rather quasi-pl. ns., signifying
Goats;] the kind of غَنَم opposed to ضَأْنٌ; (S,
A, K;) the kind of عَنَم that have hair; (Msb,
TA;) the ضأْن being those that have wool;
(TA;) as also ↓ مِعْزًى, (S, Msb, K,) accord.
to Sb, (S,) with tenween, (S, Msb,) when indeterminate, (Msb,) and perfectly decl., (S,) the
ا [which is written ى] being a letter of quasicoördination, not a characteristic of the fem.
gender, (S, Msb,) for the word is quasi-coördinate to دِرْهَمٌ, of the measure فِعْلَلٌ; for the ا of
quasi-coördination follows the same rules as a
letter belonging to the word itself, as is shown
by their saying ↓ مُعَيْزٍ and أُرَيْطٍ [originally
مُعَيْزِىٌ and أُرَيْطِىٌ] as the dim. forms of مِعْزًى
and أَرْطًى with tenween, the letter next after
the ى of diminution being with kesr, like as they
say دُرَيْهِمٌ; for if the ا were to denote the fem.
gender they would not change it into ى [in
مُعَيْزِىٌ, the original form of مُعَيْزٍ,] like as they
do not change it in the dims. of حُبْلَى and أَخْرَى
[which are حُبَيْلَى and أُخَيْزَى]: (S:) it is
sometimes made fem., [by being written or
pronounced مِعْزَاةٌ,] and sometimes it is made imperfectly decl. [and therefore without tenween]:
(K:) Fr says, that it is [itself] fem., but that
some make it masc. [and therefore with tenween]: but A 'Obeyd says, that most of the
Arabs pronounce ذِفْرَى without tenween, while
some of them pronounce it with tenween, whereas
all of them pronounce مِعْزًى with tenween: (S:)
IAar says, that it is perfectly decl. when likened
to the measure مِفْعَلٌ, and imperfectly decl. when
held to accord. with the measure فِعْلَى: (TA:)
accord. to Aboo-'Amr, Ibn-El-'Alà, it is from
مَعَزٌ, [inf. n. of مَعِزَ,] and in like manner ذِفْرَى
is from ذَفَرٌ: (As, S:) ↓ مَعِيزٌ also signifies the
same as مَعْزٌ, (S, A, K,) or is pl. of مَعْزٌ, [or
rather a quasi-pl. n.] like as عَبِيدٌ is of عَبْدٌ;
(Msb;) and ↓ أُمْعُوزٌ also is syn. with مَعْزٌ, (S, K,)
and so are ↓ مِعَازٌ (K) and ↓ مِعْزَآءٌ: (Sgh, K:)
[respecting أُمْعُوزٌ, see also below:] مَعْزٌ [as well
as its syns. mentioned above, like all quasi-pl. ns.,
is sometimes masc., but generally] is fem.: (Msb:)
a male is called ↓ مَاعِزٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) and so
a female; (Msb, K;) or a female is called
↓ مَاعِزَةٌ (S, A, TA) [and ↓ مَعْزَةٌ (M, voce شَرْقَآءُ)] and
↓ مِعْزَاة; (TA;) and شَاةٌ [or rather شَاةٌ مِنَ المَعْزِ]
is also used as a sing., (Msb,) and is applied to
a male and to a female: (Msb, art. شوه:) [see also
ظَبْىٌ:] أَمْعُزٌ is a pl. [of pauc.] of مَعْزٌ, like as
أَعْبُدٌ is of عَبْدٌ: (Msb:) the pl. of ↓ مَاعِزٌ, (K,) or
of مَاعِزَةٌ, (S,) is مَوَاعِزُ; (S, K;) and ↓ مِعَازٌ and
↓ أُمْعُوزٌ are said to be quasi-pl. ns. (TA.) The goats
of the Arabs of the desert have short hair, not
long enough to be spun; but the goats of the cold
countries, and of the people of the fertile regions,
have abundant hair, and of this the Akrád [or
Kurds] fabricate their tents. (T in art. بنى.)

أَمْعَزُ, and its fem. مَعْزَآءُ, applied respectively to
a place (مَكَانٌ) and to land or ground (أَرْضٌ),
(tropical:)  Hard, (S, K,) and abounding with pebbles: (S:)
or both, [used as substs.,] rugged and stony
ground: (A:) or a place abounding with pebbles,
and hard: or the latter, small pebbles: (A 'Obeyd,
TA:) thus A 'Obeyd explains a sing. as having a
pl. signification: (TA:) or the latter, a desert,
(صَحْرَآء) in which is elevation and ruggedness, consisting of soil, or clay, and pebbles, mixed together,
but hard ground, rough to the tread: (ISh, TA:)
pl. مُعْزٌ, (K,) [a pl. of each as an epithet, or of
each used as a subst.,] because imagined to have
the character of an epithet; (TA;) and أَمَاعِزُ, [a
pl. of the former,] because the character of a
subst. predominates in it; and مَعْزَاوَاتٌ, a pl. of
the latter. (TA.)
