which latter is of the dial. of Teiyi; (TA;) and

-b3-  اللَّبَنُ لَا يَمُوتُ
[The milk will not die], in a saying of 'Omar,
in a trad., means, that if a child sucks the milk
of a dead woman, it becomes unlawful for him
afterwards to marry any of her relations who
would be unlawful to him if he sucked her milk
while she was living: or it means, that, if milk
taken from the breast of a woman is given to a
child to drink, and he drinks it, the consequence
is the same; that the effect of the milk in producing this consequence is not annulled by its
separation from the breast; for whatever is
separated from a living being is termed ميت, or
dead, except the milk and hair and wool on
account of the necessity of making use of these.

that has no owner (S, K) of mankind, and of
which no use is made, or from which no

(En-Nawawee:) land that has not been sown,
nor cultivated, nor occupied by any man's camels
&c.: ↓ مَوَتَانٌ signifies the same as مُوَاتٌ (مَوَاتٌ?),
namely, land that is no man's property; and
is also written مَوْتَانٌ: (L:) or مَوَتَانٌ signifies
land that has not yet been brought into a state
of cultivation: (Fr, S, L, K:) in a trad. it is said,
that such land is the property of God and his
Apostle; and whosoever brings into a state of
cultivation such land, to him it belongs. (S.)
مُوَاتٌ: see مَوْتٌ and مُوتَانٌ.
مَيِّتٌ and ↓ مَيْتٌ signify the same, [Dead, or
dying]: (Zj, S, K:) the former is originally
مَيْوِتٌ, of the measure فَيْعِلٌ: (S:) the latter is
contracted from the former; and is both masc.
and fem.; (Zj, S;) as is also the former. (Zj.)
'Adee Ibn-Er-Raalà says,
↓ لَيْسَ مَنْ مَاتَ فَاسْتَرَاحَ بِمَيْتٍ
إِنَّمَا المَيْتُ مَيِّتُ الأَحْيَآءِ
[He who has died and become at rest is not dead:
the dead is only the dead of the living]. (S, TA.)
Or ↓ مَيْتٌ signifies One who has died (actually,
TA,); and مَيِّتٌ, as also ↓ مَائِتٌ, one who has
not yet died, (K,) but who is near to dying: or,
accord. to a verse cited by AA, to Kh, مَيْتٌ is
applied to him who is borne to the grave; [i. e.,
who is dead, or lifeless]; and مَيِّتٌ, to him who
[is dying, but] has life in him. (TA.) Fr says,
you say of him who has not died, إِنَّهُ مَائِتٌ,
عَنْ قَلِيلٍ ↓ and مَيِّتٌ; but you do not say of
him who has died ↓ هذا مَائِتٌ: (S:) but some
say, that this is an error, and that مَيِّتٌ is
applicable to that which will soon die. Those who
assert that ميّت is applicable only to the living
adduce the following words of the Kur, [xxxix.
31,] إِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ وَإِنَّهُمْ مَيِّتُونَ: (TA:) i. e. Verily
thou wilt die, and verily they will die. (Msb.)
MF observes, that مَيْتٌ is asserted to be contracted from مَيِّتٌ; and if so, that there can be
no difference in their meanings: that the making
a difference between them is contrary to analogy;
agreeably with which, they should be like هَيْنٌ
and هَيِّنٌ, and لَيْنٌ and لَيِّنٌ: and also contrary
to what has been heard from the Arabs; for
they made no difference in their use of these two
words. (TA.) [See also what is said of مَيْتَةٌ,
below.] The pls. are أَمْوَاتٌ and مَوْتَى and مَيِّتُونَ
and مَيْتُونَ. (S, K.) The first of these is pl. of
مَيِّتٌ, and consequently of مَيْتٌ, because this
latter is contracted from the former: as مَيِّتٌ is
of the measure فَيْعِلٌ, and this measure resembles
فَاعِلٌ, it has received a form of pl. which is
sometimes applicable to the measure فاعل: (Sb:)
or اموات is [only] pl. of مَيْتٌ. (Msb.) [The
second form (which is applied to rational beings,
Msb,) is also pl. of ميّت and ميت.] The third
and fourth are [only] applied to rational beings.
(Msb.) The fem. epithet is مَيِّتَةٌ and مَيْتَةٌ and
مَيِّتٌ (K, TA) and مَيْتٌ. (TA; and so in some
copies of the K, in the place of مَيِّتٌ.) مَيِّتَةٌ is an
epithet applied to a female rational being; [and its
pl. is مَيِّتَاتٌ:] مَيْتَةٌ, to a female brute, for the
sake of distinction; and its pl. is مَيْتَاتٌ: the
latter is contracted because it is more in use than
the former epithet applied to a female rational
being: (Msb:) the pl. of ميّت and ميت as
fem. epithets is as above [أَمْوَاتٌ and مَوْتَى].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  ↓ مَيْتَةٌ signifies That which has not
been slaughtered (AA, S, K) [in the manner
prescribed by the law, i. e., carrion]: or that of
which the life has departed without slaughter:
so in the classical language and in the language
of practical law: all such is unlawful to be
eaten, except fish and locusts, which are lawful by universal consent of the Muslims: (En-Nawawee:) or, in the common acceptation of the
language of law, what has died a natural death,
or been killed in a state or manner different from
that prescribed by the law, either the agent or
the animal killed not being such as is so prescribed; as that which is sacrificed to an idol,
or slaughtered [by a person] in the state of
إِحْرَام, or not by having the throat cut, and
that which it is unlawful to eat, such as a dog:
(Msb:) [and any separated part of an animal
of which the flesh is not lawful food: see عَاجٌ.] ―

بَلَدٌ مَيِّتٌ A tract of land without herbage, or
pasture, (Msb, in art. بلد.) ―

مُمِيتٌ and مُمِيتَةٌ (tropical:)  A woman, and a she-camel,
that has lost her offspring by death: (S:) and a
woman who has lost her husband by death: (TA:)
pl. مَمَاوِيتُ. (S.)
مُتَمَاوِتٌ (tropical:)  [Feigning himself dead]. ―
-b2-  (tropical:)  An
epithet applied to A hypocritical devotee, (S, K,)
who pretends to be like one dead in his devotion,
who lowers his voice, and moves little: as though
he were one who put on the outward appearance
of devotees, and constrained himself to characterize himself by the characteristics of the dead,
that he might be imagined to be weak by reason
of much devotion. (TA.)
مُسْتَمِيتٌ A courageous man, who seeks, or
courts death: (K:) a man who seeks to be slain;
who cares not, in war, for death: (S:) abandon-
ing, or devoting, himself to death, (مسْتَرْسِلٌ لِلْمَوْتِ,)
as also مُسْتَقْتِلٌ. (A.) ―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  Abandoning, or devoting
himself to a thing, or affair; syn. مُسْتَرْسِلٌ لِأَمْرٍ.
(S, K.) ―

وَاللَّيْلُ فَوْقَ المَاءِ مُسْتَمِيتُ
[And to the froth of the sea there was a sound
like that of boiling, and night impended over the
water]. (S.) [It is implied in the S that
مستميت here signifies مُسْتَرْسِل.] ―
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  One who
feigns himself to be insane, or possessed by a devil;
not being really so. (TA.) ―
-b6-  (assumed tropical:)  One who feigns

him, and, when he is satiated, is ungrateful to his
benefactors. (TA.) ―

of being good and quiet or tranquil, and is not so
in reality. (Ibn-El-Mubárak.)
