ملذ1

in his running. (K, in which only the inf. n. is
mentioned.) ―
-b3-  He (a-horse) stretched forth his
arms, (مَذَّ ضَبْعَيْهِ, S, M, L, K,) in running, (S,) to
a degree that he could not exceed, to overtake,
(حَتَّى لَا يَجِدَ مَزِيدًا لِلِّحَاقٍ, M, L, K,) and contracted, or drew in, (حَبَسَ, [perhaps a mistake for
خَنَسَ, which may mean either contracted, or
threw back,]) his hind legs to a degree that he could
not exceed, to overtake, without any confusion [in
his motions]. (M, L.) ―
-b4-  مَلَذَهُ, aor.
مَلُذَ, inf. n.
مَلْذٌ and مَلَاذَةٌ, He contented him with courteous
and soothing speech, and made him to hear that
which rejoiced him, without doing, or performing,
anything. (T, L.) Accord. to Aboo-Is-hák, the
ذ in this word is a substitute for ث. (M, L.)

مَلَّاذٌ A man who says but does not act, or perform; (S, L, K;) a liar; (S, L;) who behaves
in an artificial manner, and is not true in his
affection; (M, L, K;) as also ↓ مَلُوذٌ (M, L [in
the K مِلْوَذٌ, and said to be of the same measure
as مِنْبَرٌ; but this seems to be a mistake]) and
↓ مَلَذَانٌ and ↓ مَلَذَانِىٌّ (M, L, K) and ↓ مَلَاذَنِىٌّ:
(M, K:) [in some copies of the K, by a mistake
in the last vowel-sign, each of the last three of
these epithets is as though it were syn. with
مَلْذٌ, the inf. n of مَلَذَ, “he lied ” &c.:] or a liar,
who, if asked, will not tell truly whence he comes;
as also all the above epithets: (M, L:) and
