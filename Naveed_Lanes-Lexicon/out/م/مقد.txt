مقدمَقَدِىٌّ A certain kind of beverage, prepared
from honey, (S, L, K,) which the Khaleefehs of
the sons of Umeyyeh used to drink: (L:) so
called in relation to a town in Syria, (S, L,) called
مَقَدٌ; or in relation to a town in Syria in the
province of El-Urdunn: (L:) or this is a mistake;
for the name of the town is with teshdeed [مَقَدٌّ]:
IB says, that the orthography of the word as best
known to the lexicologists is مَقَدِىٌّ, without
teshdeed; but that A 'Obeyd and others write it
with teshdeed; and that IAmb cites in confirmation of its being thus a verse of 'Amr Ibn-Maadeekerib, at the end of which occurs the expression
شَغَلُوهُ عَنْ شَرْبِ المَقَدِّ; without ى; [app. for
مَقَدِّى;] adding, that it is thus called in relation
to مَقَدٌّ, a town of Damascus, in the mountain
overlooking El-Ghór: (L:) A 'Obeyd says, I
hold it to be correctly مَقَدِّىٌّ; and I heard Rejà
Ibn-Selemeh explain this as signifying “ wine
diminished to half its quantity by boiling; ” as
though it were divided (قُدَّ) in halves: (Sh, L:)
IB adds, that Aboo-t-Teyyib the lexicologist says,
that the word in question is with د without
teshdeed; from مَقَدٌ; and is only written with
teshdeed by poetic licence: and in confirmation
of this assertion, IB cites verses in which the
name of the town and that of the beverage are
written without teshdeed. (L.) ―

erroneously, مَقَدِّيَّةٌ.])
