مَرْخٌ [a coll. gen. n.] A certain kind of tree
that quickly emits fire: (S, K:) it is of the kind
called عِضَاه, and spreads, and grows high, so that
people rest in its shade: it has neither leaves nor
thorns, its branches being bare and slender twigs;
and it grows in [small water-courses such as are
termed] شُعَب, and in hard grounds: of it are
made the wooden instruments for producing fire
which are called زِنَاد: the n. un. is with ة (AHn,
L) its shade is thin: (L:) there is no tree that
surpasses the مرخ in yeilding fire: sometimes these
trees are clustered and tangled together, and the
wind blowing, and striking one part of them
against another, they emit fire, and burn the
valley: Aboo-Ziyád:) [the cynanchum viminale.
(Spreng. Hist. rei. herb., p. 252: as mentioned
by Freytag.)] It is said in a proverb, فِى كُلِّ
شَجَرٍ نَارْ وَاسْتَمْجَدَ المَرْخُ وَالْعَفَارْ [In all trees is
fire; but the markh and 'afár yield much fire]:
(S:) accord. to AHn, the meaning is, endeavour
to strike fire with gentleness; for that will be
sufficient if the زِنَاد be مَرْخ. (L.) See also
عَفَارٌ, and استمجد. The عفار is the زَنْد, which
is the upper [piece of the two which compose the
زَنَاد]; and the مَرْخ is the lower. (S, L.) [See
also another proverb at the end of art. دفل.] ―
