retired. (TA.) And مَخَرَ السَّابِحُ The swimmer

تمخّر الرِّيحَ He (a horse) faced the wind,
(K,) or turned his nose towards the wind, (TA,)
for the sake of greater ease to himself; as also
↓ امتخرها, and ↓ استمخرها. (K.) It is mostly
said of the camel: you say, تمخّرت الإِبِلُ الرِّيحَ
The camels faced the wind, and snuffed it. (TA.)
And, met., of a man; as in the following ex.:
خَرَجْتُ أَتَمَخَّرُ الرِّيحَ, app. meaning, (tropical:)  I went
forth to snuff the wind. (TA.) You also say,
الرِّيحَ ↓ إِسْتَمْخَرْتُ (assumed tropical:)  I directed my nose towards
the wind. (S, A.) And it is said in a trad.,
إِذَا أَرَادَ أَحَدُكُمُ البَوْلَ فَلْيَتَمَخَّرِ الرِّيحَ (S, K)
(assumed tropical:)  When any one of you desires to make water, let
him see whence the wind blows, and not face it,
that it may not drive back the urine against
him, (S, TA,) and cause it to sprinkle him;
but let him turn his back to the wind. (TA.)
And again, (K,) in a trad. of Surákah, as related
by ISh, on the same subject, (TA,) ↓ إِسْتَمْخِرُوا
الرِّيحَ, i.e., Turn ye your backs to the wind,
(K,) in making water; (TA;) as though,
(كَأَنَّهُ: so in the copies of the K; but in the
Nh of IAth, لِأَنَّهُ, for, TA) when one turns
his back to it, he (as it were, TA) cleaves it
with his back, so that it passes on his right and
left: for though تَمَخُّرٌ sometimes means the act
of facing the wind, yet in this trad. it means
the turning the back: (K:) but this is not
properly its meaning; for the meaning is, the
looking to see whence the wind blows: then the
man is to turn his back. (TA.) You say also
تمخّرت الإِبِلُ الكَلَأَ The camels turned themselves
towards the pasture. (L.)

it. (K.) An arabicized word, from [the Persian] مَيْخُورْ, or مَىْ خُورْ, or مَيْخَوارْ, (as in
different copies of the K,) meaning “ a winedrinker ” : so that as a name of the place, it is
tropical: (TA:) or Arabic, from مَخَرَتِ السَّفِينَةُ,
(K,) meaning “ the ship advanced and retired ”;
(TA;) because of men's frequenting it, going to
and fro: (K:) in which case also it is tropical.
