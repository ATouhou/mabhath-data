موس1
مَاسَ, aor. يَمُوسُ, (Msb,) inf. n. مَوْسٌ, (Sgh,
Msb, K,) He shaved (Sgh, Msb, K) the head,
(Sgh, Msb,) or the hair: (K:) but Sgh says,
that its correctness requires consideration, and
it was doubted by IF. (TA.) See مُوسَى,
below.
المَاسُ, not أَلْمَاسٌ, (K,) i. e., with the disjunctive hemzeh, (TA,) for this is an incorrect pronunciation, (K,) of the vulgar, as Sgh and others
have plainly asserted; but IAth says, I think
that the hemzeh and lám in it are radical letters,
as they are in الياس, [i. e., إِلْيَاس or أَلْيَاس,] and
it is not Arabic; and if so, its place is under the
letter hemzeh, because they say أَلْمَاسٌ; but if
they be [prefixed] for the purpose of rendering
the word determinate, the present is its [proper]
place; (TA;) [The diamond;] a certain precious
stone, (K, * TA,) reckoned among jewels, like the
يَاقُوت and the زُمُرُّرذ, (TA,) the largest of which
is like the walnut, (K, TA,) or the egg of the
pigeon, (TA,) and this is rare, or very rare,
(K, TA,) the only instance being said to be the
one called الكَوْكَبُ الدُّرِّىُّ, which is suspended at
the tomb of the Prophet: (TA:) it breaks all
stony bodies, and the holding it in the mouth
breaks the teeth, and fire has no effect upon it,
nor iron, but only lead breaks it and powders it,
[a strange mistake, for it is well known that it
is powdered by being pounded in a steel mortar,]
after which it is taken [in the state of powder]
upon drills, and pearls &c. are drilled with it.
(K.)
مُوسَى [A razor;] a certain instrument of
iron, (M, Msb, TA,) with which one shaves:
(Lth, L, K, TA:) of the measure فُعْلَى, (Ks,
M, Msb, K,) from المَوْسُ, [inf. n. of مَاسَ,] so
that the م is a radical letter, (K,) accord. to Lth,
(TA,) [for] Lth says, (L, TA,) المَوْسُ is the
root (تَأْسِيس [lit. foundation]) of المُوسَى, (L, K,
TA,) the thing with which one shaves; (L,
TA;) therefore, (Az, Msb, K,) it is imperfectly
decl., because of the short fem. ا [written ى],
(Msb,) without tenween; (Az, K;) and Fr
cites a verse [of obscene meaning] in which it is
made fem.: (TA:) or it is from أَوْسَيْتُ رَأْسَهُ,
meaning “ I shaved his head,” (ISk, M, * Msb,
K,) of the measure مُفْعَلٌ, (ISk, Msb, TA,) so
that the ى is a radical letter, as El-Umawee and
Yz say, and Aboo-'Amr Ibn-el-Alà inclined to
think it so, (TA,) and therefore it is perfectly
decl., (Msb,) with tenween, (Msb, K,) when
indeterminate; (Msb;) or it is of the measure
مُفْعَلٌ because this measure is more common than
فُعْلَى, and because it is perfectly decl. when
indeterminate, whereas فُعْلَى is not so when
indeterminate and when determinate: (Ibn-EsSarráj, TA:) but IAmb says, that it is masc.
and fem., and perfectly decl. and imperfectly
decl.: ISk says, that the approved way is to
make it perfectly decl.: (Msb:) [but] he says
that it is fem. [also, and if so it is imperfectly
decl.]: (TA:) and it is related of A'Obeyd, in
the Bári', that he said he had not heard it
made masc. except by El-Umawee; (Msb;) who
asserted it to be masc. only: (TA:) the pl.,
accord. to him who makes it imperfectly decl.,
is مُوسَيَاتٌ; and accord. to him who makes it
perfectly decl., مَوَاسٍ. (Msb.) The dim. of
موسى, in the sense above explained, [not as a
proper name, in which case it is مُوسَى only,
without tenween, and has no relation to the
same word signifying a razor,] is مُوَيْسِيَةٌ, [but
by rule it should be مُوَيْسَى, like حُبَيْلَى,] accord.
to him who says هٰذِهِ مُوسَى; and مُوَيْسٍ accord.
to him who says هٰذَا مُوسًى. (ISk, TA.)
