مَثَلٌ
i. q.
صِفَةٌ [as meaning A description, condition, state, case, &c.]; (S, K, &c.;) or وَصْفٌ
[meaning the same]: (Msb:) or this is a mistake: (Mbr, AAF, TA:) or it may be a tropical
signification: (MF, TA:) for in the language of
the Arabs it means a description by way of comparison: (AAF, TA:) you say مثل زيد مثل
فلان [The description of Zeyd, by way of comparison, or the condition, &c., is that of such a
one]: it is from المِثاَلُ and الحَذْوُ: (Mbr, TA:)
it is metaphorically applied to a condition, state,
or case, that is important, strange, or wonderful.
(Ksh, Bd in ii. 16.) The phrase here given is
more literally, and better, rendered, The similitude of Zeyd is the similitude, or is that, of
such a one; for a similitude is a description by
way of comparison. ―
-b2-  You say also, جَعَلَهُ مَثَلًا
لِكَذَا [He made it (an expression or the like) to
