-b2-  Also, A

in one copy [of the K], a certain plant, in the root
of which is a poisonous quality (سمية [i. e., سُمِّيَّة]);
the drinking of a grain of it [in water] causes
looseness of the bowels, and vomiting, in an excessive
degree. (TA.) But these properties [says SM]
are strange, and not mentioned by the physicians.
Ibn-El-Kutbee says, in [the book entitled]
مَا لَا يَسَعُ الطَّبِيبَ جَهْلُهُ, مغاث is [the name of]
roots which are imported, of a hot and moist temperament, in one of the last measures of the second
degree, (فى اواخر الثانية,) [the degrees of heat
and cold and dryness and moistness being four,]
the best of which are the white and soft, inclining
to yellow: it is fattening, strengthening to the
limbs or members, of use in cases of fracture and
contusion, applied in a bandage, and drunk; also
for the gout (نِقْرِس), and spasmodic contraction
(تَشَنُّج); and softens hardness of the joints; and
improves the voice, and clears the throat and lungs;
and excites to sexual intercourse. Some say, that
it is the name of] the roots of the wild pomegranate; but this assertion is not of established
authority. Others say, that it is a kind of
سُورَنْجَان; and this is not improbable. The
hakeem [Dáood] says, in the Tedhkireh, مغاث is
[the name of] a certain plant in El-Kerej (الكرج)
and the parts adjacent; roots extending deep into
the earth, and thick, with a rind inclining to black
and red, which, when peeled off, discloses a substance, between white and yellow: the best thereof
is the heavy, sweet-scented, in taste inclining to
sweet, with a slight bitterness. It is said to have
rough, or coarse, and wide, leaves, like those of the
radish; and a white flower; and seeds resembling
the grains of the سُمْنَة, and called قلقل: hence it
has been imagined to be the pomegranate: and it
is said to be a species of سورنجان: its strength, or
virtue, lasts about seven years: and there is a kind
of it brought from 'Abbádán, and towards Syria,
weak in operation; and it is this which is used in
Egypt. (TA.) [M. Rouyer, in the Descr. de
l'Egypte, tome 11 of the sec. ed., p. 452, describes
it as follows: a root of a whitish colour, mucilaginous, fleshy, or pulpous, and of an aromatic
odour: it is nutritive and aphrodisiac: it is taken
in the simple substance; and they make of it a
sherbet, which should be drunk hot: this root
comes from the Indies.]
