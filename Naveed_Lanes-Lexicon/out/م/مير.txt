brings, or conveys or purveys (يَمْتَارُهُ) [to be laid
up in store for himself or his family or household,
or for sale]; (S, TA;) and ↓ مَيْرٌ signifies the
same as مِيرَةٌ [in these senses, as will be seen
from what follows], and is applied to victuals, or

المِيرَةِ, (K,) or ↓ المَيْرِ, (M,) [The bringer, or
conveyer, or purveyor, of wheat, &c.] And
أَتَاهُ بِمِيرَةٍ He brought him طَعَام. (T.) And

(M, arts. دفأ and صيف,) which is the ميرة in
the beginning of [the season called] the شِتَآء [or
winter, i. e., in the latter part of December or in
January, during the season of rains called
الرَّبِيع, about which time, the species of millet
called ذُرَة, which, as Niebuhr mentions, (Descr.
de l'Arabie, p. 135, note,) is called in El-Yemen
طَعَام, is gathered in]: (S, K, art. ربع:) the
second, the صَيْفِيَّة, (M, arts, دفأ and صيف,) also
called the صَائِفَة, (S, M, K, art. صيف,) which is
the ميرة in [the season called] the صَيْف [or
spring], (S, M, art. صيف,) in the first part of
the صَيْف [i. e., in the latter part of March, about
which time, wheat, and a second crop of millet
(ذُرَة), and barley, are gathered in]: (M, art.
صيف:) the third, the دَفَئِيَّة, (M, arts. دفأ and
صيف,) which is [also] in the first part of [the
season called] the صَيْف [or spring, and consequently immediately after the صَيْفِيَّة, commencing in the season of the دَفَئِىّ rains, and
app. continuing during part of April, when the
same grains are gathered in; or by the صَيْف
in this instance may be meant summer, but
the more proper meaning is spring, and the
term دَفَئِيَّةٌ seems already to point to the
season of the دَفَئِىّ rains]: (M, art. دفأ:) and
the fourth, the رَمَضِيَّة, (M, arts. دفأ and صيف,)
which is the ميرة coming when the earth
becomes burnt [by the sun, about July, when
the month of رَمَضَان began at the period when
the calendar by the months was fixed by Kiláb
Ibn-Murrah, about two centuries before the
Hijreh, and at which season of the year a third
crop of ذُرَة is gathered in; for in some parts of
Arabia they have three crops of this grain in
the year; the second and third being sown
immediately after, or produced by the grain
which is let fall in cutting, the first and second].
(M, art. دفأ.)

مَائِرٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ مَيَّارٌ (M, K) One who
brings, or conveys, or purveys, مِيرَة, (S, * K,) or

the towns or villages to bring مِيرَة. (TA.) It is
said in a trad. الحَمُولَةُ المَائِرَةُ لَهُمْ لاَغِيَةٌ, meaning,
The camels that carry مِيرَة for them for sale
and the like are exempt from the eleëmosynary
taxation, because they are working beasts.
