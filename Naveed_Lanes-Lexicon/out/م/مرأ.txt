said in the Keshsháf, on ch. iv., v. 3, of the Kur,
that هَنِىْءٌ and مَرِىْءٌ are two epithets from
هَنَأَ الطَّعَامُ and مَرَأَ, “the food was easy to
swallow; not attended by trouble:” or the
former epithet signifies “ pleasant, or productive
of enjoyment, to the eater; ” and the latter,
“wholesome, or approved in its result: ” or
the former, food or drink that is “ not succeeded
by harm, even after its digestion;” and the
latter, that which is “ quick in digesting. ”

مَرْءٌ and ↓ مُرْءٌ (S, K) and ↓ مِرْءٌ (K) A man, or
human being; syn. إِنْسَانٌ: (K:) or a man as
opposed to a child or a woman; syn. رَجُلٌ.
(S, K.) You say مَرْءٌ in the nom., مَرْءًا in the
acc., and مَرْءٍ in the gen., (S,) agreeably with
analogy. (TA.) And some say مُرْءٌ in the nom.,
مَرْءًا in the acc., and مِرْءٍ in the gen.; doubly
declining the word. (TA, and some copies of
the S.) And ↓ مِرْء is said to be of the dial. of
Hudheyl. It is said that no pl. is formed from
مرء; but مَرْؤُونَ occurs as its pl. in the following
words of a trad.; أَحْسِنُوا أَمْلَاءَكُمْ أَيُّهَا المُرْؤُونَ
[Amend your manners, O ye men!]; and in the
saying of Ru-beh, أَيْنَ يُرِيدُ المرؤون [Whither
do the men desire to go?]. (TA.) It forms a
dual; مَرْآنِ: CCC they say هُمَا مِرْآنِ صَالِحَانِ [They
are two just men] (S) in the dial. of Hudheyl.
(TA.) It also forms a dim., مُرَىْءٌ, fem. مُرَيْئَةٌ.
(S.) ―
-b2-  The fem. of مَرْءٌ is مَرْأَةٌ, A woman: [and
a wife:] also written and pronounced مَرَةٌ. (S,
K.) ―
-b3-  مرء is also written with the conjunctive ا:
you say امْرَأٌ in the nom., امْرَأً in the acc., and
امْرَأٍ in the gen.: also, امْرُؤٌ in the nom., امْرُؤًا
in the acc., and امْرُؤٍ in the gen.: also, امْرُؤٌ in the
nom., امْرَأً in the acc., and امْرِئٍ in the gen.;
doubly declining the word. (S, K, TA.) [The
last three forms are the most common in classical
works: but in ordinary parlance, in the present
day, the word is generally pronounced with fet-h
to the ر in each case. The final ء is also often
written without the ا or و or ى.] Ks and Fr
say, that the word is doubly declined, as to the
ر and ء, because the final ء is often omitted.
(T, TA.) [When the disjunctive ا is substituted
for the conjunctive, i. e., when the word is immediately preceded by a quiescence, its vowel is
kesr: thus you say اِمْرَأٌ &c.; and thus
also in the fem. The name of the famous poet
اِمْرَأُ القَيْسِ CCC is commonly pronounced Imra-el-
Keys and Imr-el-Keys.] ―
-b4-  The fem. is امْرَأَةٌ,
A woman: [and a wife:] but with ال you say
المَرْأَةُ: الاِمْرَأَةُ [which is authorized by the K]
is also said to be established by usage; but most
of the expositors of the Fs reject this; and those
who allow it to be correct judge it of weak
authority: IO mentions also امْرَاةٌ, with soft ا
after the ر. (TA.) ―
-b5-  امْرَُءٌ is also used in a fem.
sense; (S;) though this is extr.: ex. إِنَّهَا لَامْرَُءَ
صِدْق [Verily she is an excellent woman: see
صِدْقٌ]. (TA.) And امْرَأَةٌ is used, in a trad.,
as signifying a perfect woman: لَقَدْ تَزَوَّجْتَ امْرَأَةً
Indeed thou hast married a perfect woman: like
as you say فُلَانٌ رَجُلٌ, meaning “ Such a one is
a perfect man. ” (TA.) ―
-b6-  Also, اِمْرَأٌ or امْرُؤٌ,
(S,) or مَرْءٌ, (K,) signifies A wolf: (S, K:) or,
as Z and others assert, it is tropical in this sense.
Yoo says, that the poet means, by امرؤ, in the
following verse, a wolf:
وَأَنْتَ امْرُؤٌ تَعْدُو عَلَى كُلِّ غِرَّةٍ
فَتُخْطِئُ فِيهَا مَرَّةً وَتُصِيبُ
[And thou art a wolf that assaultest on every
occasion of carelessness; and sometimes thou
missest therein, and (sometimes) thou attainest
thine object]. (TA.) ―
-b7-  The rel. n. of امْرَُءٌ is
مَرَئِىٌّ (as in one copy of the S) or مُرَئِىٌّ (as in
another copy) and أَمَرِىٌّ. (S, and El-Ashmoonee
and others.) [For the last, Golius, from a copy
of the S, gives اِمْرَئِىٌّ: and in one copy of the S,
I find it written أَمْرَئِىٌّ: but I have not met with
any confirmation of either of these two forms.]
مَرَئِىٌّ seems to be formed from مَرْءٌ; but is extr.;
the analogous form being مَرْئِىٌّ. (TA.)
مَرَأٌ A giving of food on the occasion of building
a house, or marrying. (TA.)
مَرِىْءٌ [The œsophagus, or gullet of a slaughtered
camel, or sheep or goat, (S,) and of a man, (Zj,
in his Khalk el-Insán,) the canal through which
the food and drink pass; (S, K;) the head of the
stomach; (K;) contiguous, (S,) or adherent (K)
to the حُلْقُوم [or windpipe]; (S, K;) through
which the food and drink pass, and by which they
enter: (TA;) pl. [of pauc.] أَمْرِئَةٌ (K) and [of
mult.] مُرُؤٌ. (S, K.) It is also written مَرِىٌّ.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  يَأْتِينا فِى مِثْلِ مَرِىْءِ النَّعَامِ [It comes to
us as it were through the gullet of the ostrich]: a
proverbial expression, from a trad., alluding to
paucity of food; the ostrich being particularized
because of the slenderness of its neck, whence is
inferred the narrowness of its gullet. (TA.) ―
-b3-
