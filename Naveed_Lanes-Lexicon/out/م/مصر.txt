made the place, or appointed it to be, a مِصْر
[meaning a city, or town, such as is thus called].
(M, * K.) It is said of 'Omar, مَصَّرَ الأَمْصَارَ,
(TA,) which is a phrase like مَدَّنَ المُدُنَ, (S,)
[and signifying He appointed the cities, or towns
called أَمْصَار: or] مصّر الامصار signifies he built
the [cities, or towns, called] امصار: (A:) among
which امصار were El-Basrah and El-Koofeh.

تمصّر It (a place) became a مِصْر [meaning

مِصْرٌ A partition, barrier, or thing intervening,
between two things: (S, M, K:) as also ↓ مَاصِرٌ:
(K:) and (S) or limit, or boundary, between two
lands: (M, K:) pl. مُصُورٌ. (S, M.) The people
of Egypt, (S,) or of Hejer, (M,) or of both,
(TA,) write in their contracts, (S, M, *) إِشْتَرَى
فُلَانٌ الدَّارَ بِمُصُورِهَا Such a one bought the house
with its limits, or boundaries. (S, M, * K. *) ―
-b2-
Hence, A great town; syn. بَلَدٌ عَظِيمٌ; (Bd, ii.
58;). a كُورَة [here meaning city, or provincial
city]: (M, K:) or a كُورَة (Lth, IF, Msb) in
which the [ordinances of God which are termed]
حُدُود are executed, and (Lth, TA) in which the
[spoil or tribute termed] فَىْء and the [alms
termed] صَدَقَات are divided (Lth, IF, Msb)
without consulting the Khaleefeh; such is its
signification in the language of the Arabs: (Lth,
TA:) or that [town] whereof the greatest of its
mosques will not hold, or contain, its inhabitants:
(KT:) it is masc. and perfectly decl., and fem.
and imperfectly decl.: (Msb:) [but this remark
seems properly to relate to the word when used as
the name of the metropolis of Egypt, and of
Egypt itself, agreeably with what is said in the S,
M, and K:] pl. أَمْصَارٌ. (S, M, Msb.) The dual,
المِصْرَانِ, is applied to El-Koofeh and El-Basrah.
(S, M, A, K.)
مَصِيرٌ A gut, an intestine, or a bowel, into which
the food passes from the stomach; syn. مِعًى:
(S, M, Msb, K:) or specially, as some say, of a
bird, and of an animal which has a soft foot, or
خُفّ, [as the camel,] and of such as have a cloven
hoof: (M, TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَمْصِرَةٌ (M, K)
and [of mult.] مُصْرَانٌ, and pl. pl. مَصَارِينُ: (S,
M, A, Msb, K:) the last accord. to Sb; (M;)
but some say that it is not established; (A;) and
Lth says, that it is a mistake; but Az says, that
it is pl. of مُصْرَانٌ, and that the Arabs have given
it this form of pl. imagining the م to be a radical
letter; (TA;) and some say, that مَصِيرٌ is of
the measure مَفْعِلٌ, [originally مَصْيِرٌ,] derived
from صَار إِلَيْهِ الطَّعَامُ [“ the food passed to it ”],
and they say مُصْرَانٌ in like manner as they say
مُسْلَانٌ as pl. of مَسِيلُ المَآءِ, likening مَفْعِلٌ to
فَعِيلٌ: (S, TA:) مِصْرَانٌ also is a dial. form of
مُصْرَانٌ. (Fr, Sgh, TA.) [See also مَصَارّ, in art.
صر.] ―
-b2-  مُصْرَانُ الفَارَةِ, (S, Msb,) or مُصْرَانُ الفَأْرِ,
