(S:) or in relation to Mahreh, a district
of 'Omán: (Msb:) they are excellent camels,
that outstrip horses; and some add, that they
are unequalled in quickness of running, understanding what is desired of them with the least
training, and having names, by which being
called, they answer quickly: (Msb:) [and hence,
any such like camels; i. e. any excellent, fleet,
camels: (see 4:) n. un. مَهْرِىٌّ:] pl. مَهَارِىُّ
[which is irreg. like ظَهَارِىٌّ] (S, Msb, K) and

مَمْهُورَةٌ A woman dowered; to whom a dowry
has been given; or for whom a dowry has been
set apart. (Msb.) It is said in a proverb,
كَالْمَمْهُورَةِ إِحْدَى خَدَمَتَيْهَا [Like her who has
been dowered with one of her two anklets]: (S,
K:) or أَحْمَقُ مِنَ الْمَمْهُورَةِ إِحْدَى خَدَمَتَيْهَا
[More stupid than she who has been dowered with
one of her two anklets]: (Mgh:) applied to him
who has reached the utmost degree of stupidity:
from the following case: (TA:) a stupid woman
demanded of her husband her dowry, (K, TA,)
when he paid her his first visit, and she said, I
will not obey thee unless thou give me my
dowry: (TA:) so he pulled off one of her two
anklets (K, TA) from her foot, (TA,) and gave
it to her, and she was content with it. (K, TA.)
In like manner, a certain man gave to another
property, and he married with it the daughter
of the giver, and then reproached her for the
dowry he had given her: so they said, كَالْمَمْهُورَةِ
مِنْ مَالِ أَبِيهَا [Like her who has been dowered
from the property of her father]: (K, TA:)
[a proverb] applied in relation to him who
reproaches for that which is not his own. (TA.)
