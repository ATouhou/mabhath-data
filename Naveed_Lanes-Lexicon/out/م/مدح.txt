مدح1
مَدَحَهُ, (S, K,) aor.
مَدَحَ, (K,) inf. n. مَدْحٌ
(S, K) and مِدْحَةٌ, (K,) as some say, but
correctly this latter is a simple subst.; (TA;)
and ↓ امتدحهُ; (S, K;) and ↓ مدّحهُ, (K,)
inf. n. تَمْدِيح; (TA;) [but this, and that next
preceding it, have an intensive signification, as

ns., which see below;] and ↓ تمدّحهُ; (K:)
[which seems to imply some degree of effort in
the agent;] He praised, eulogized, or commended,
him; spoke well of him; mentioned him with approbation: (S, K:) or he described him as
characterized by goodliness, beauty, or elegance;
opposite of ذَمَّهُ: and he enumerated his generous
qualities or actions; opposite of هَجَاهُ: (MF:)
or he praised him for his goodly qualities, whether
natural or depending upon his own will; and
hence it is of more common application than
حَمَدَهُ: accord. to El-Khateeb El-Tebreezee, it
is from the phrase تَمَدَّحَتِ الأَرْضُ “ the land became ample, or spacious; ” whence it would
seem to signify he amplified his phrase: accord.
to Kh, مَدَحَهُ relates to an absent person; and
مَدَهَهُ, to one who is present: and accord. to EsSarakustee, مَدْهٌ is descriptive of the state, or
condition, and external appearance or form; and
of nothing beside. (Msb.)
