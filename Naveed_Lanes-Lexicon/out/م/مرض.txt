state termed مَرَضٌ (S, Msb, K) denoting that

below; (K;) as also ↓ امرض, expl. by صَارَ ذَا

[Hence, مَرِضَتِ العَيْنُ (tropical:)  The eye became languid;

(Th, O.) ―
-b4-  [The verb probably has several
other tropical significations agreeable with explanations of مَرَضٌ and مَرِيضٌ which will be
found below.]

مرّضهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. تَمْرِيضٌ, (S,
Msb, K,) He took care of him in his sickness;
(Sb, S, Mgh;) and treated him medically, to
remove his disease; the measure فَعَّلَ in this
instance having a privative quality, though its
quality is in most instances confirmative: (Sb:)
or he took good care of him, namely a sick
person: (K:) or he undertook, or managed, or
superintended, the medical treatment of him.
(Msb.)
-A2-  مرّض فِى الأَمْرِ, (IDrd, A,) [and
مَرَّضَهُ, (O, K voce ضَهْيَأَ,)] inf. n. as above,
(S, K,) (tropical:)  He fell short of doing what he ought to
have done, or was remiss, in, or with respect to,
the affair: (S, A:) or he did not exert himself

as also فِيهِ ↓ مارض. (TA.) [See also 5.] And

in activity in accomplishing my want. (TA.)
And مرّض فِى كَلَامِهِ (tropical:)  He was weak in his

that it was doubtful, or was a mere assertion;
as when the word قِيلَ is used.]
3
مارض فِى الأَمْرِ: see 2. ―
-b2-  مَارَضْتُ رَأْيِى فِيكَ
(tropical:)  I deceived myself, or endeavoured to deceive
myself, respecting thee. (A, TA.)

امرض: see 1. ―
-b2-  He had a bane, or murrain, (Yaakoob, S,) or a disease, or distemper,

camels. (TA.)
-A2-  امرضهُ He (God, S, Msb)
rendered him مَرِيض [or diseased, &c.]. (Sb,
S, * Msb, K.) You say also, أَكَلَ مَا لَمْ يُوَافِقْهُ
فَأَمْرَضَهُ (A, TA) [He ate what did not agree
with him, and] it caused him to fall into المَرَض
[or disease, &c.]. (TA.) ―

الأجْفَانِ (S, voce إِسْجَادٌ) (tropical:)  The lowering of the
eyelids [in a languid, or languishing, manner:
see مَرِيضٌ]. (TK, voce إِسْجَادٌ.) ―

&c.]. (K.)
-A3-  Also امرض (assumed tropical:)  He was near to
being right in opinion, (S, L, K, *) though not
altogether right. (L.) In the K, this signification is wrongly assigned to امرضهُ. (TA.)
A poet says, (S,) namely El-Ukeyshir El-Asadee,
praising 'Abd-el-Melik Ibn-Marwán, (TA.)
وَلٰكِنْ تَحْتَ ذَاكَ الشَّيْبِ حَزْمٌ
إِذَا مَا ظَنَّ أَمْرَضَ أَوْ أَصَابَا

(tropical:)  Such a one was near to attaining the object of
his [another's] want. (A, TA.)
5
تمرّض (tropical:)  He was weak, or feeble, in his

in the A that ↓ تمارض also has this signification;
like as مارض in nearly the same sense is syn.
with مرّض, q. v.: or perhaps تمارض signifies
(tropical:)  he feigned, or made a false show of, weakness, or
feebleness, in his affair: it is said, in the A, to be
used tropically as well as properly.]
6
تمارض He feigned, or made a false show
of, مَرَض [or disease, &c.] in himself. (S, A. *)

-b2-  See also 5.
مَرْضٌ: see 1: and see what here next follows,
in six places.
مَرَضٌ (IDrd, S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ مَرْضٌ:
(Msb, K:) see 1: i. q. سُقْمٌ [Disease, disorder,
distemper, sickness, illness, or malady]; (IDrd,
S;) which is the contr. of صِحَّةٌ; and affects man
and the camel [&c.]: (IDrd:) or  a certain state
foreign to the constitution or temperament, injurious to the intellect; whence it is known that
pains and tumours are accidents arising therefrom: or, as IF says, that whereby a man passes
beyond the limit of health or soundness or perfection or rectitude, whether it be disease (عِلَّة),
or (assumed tropical:)  hypocrisy, or (assumed tropical:)  a falling short of doing what
he ought to do in an affair: (Msb:) or a dark
and disordered state of the constitution or temperament, after a clear and right state thereof:
(O, K:) or ↓ مَرْضٌ is (assumed tropical:)  [a disease] of the heart:
(K:) Aboo-Is-hák says, مَرَضٌ and سُقْمٌ are said
to be in the body and (assumed tropical:)  in religion, like as صِحَّةٌ
is said to be in the body and in religion; and
↓ مَرْضٌ is in the heart, applying to (assumed tropical:)  everything
whereby a man quits a state of soundness or
perfection or rectitude in religion: (TA:) and
As says, I recited to Aboo-'Amr Ibn-El-'Alà
[the words of the Kur, ii. 9, &c.,] فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَرَضٌ
and he said to me ↓ “ مَرْضٌ, O boy ”: (AHát,
IDrd, Msb:) and مَرَضٌ, or this and ↓ مَرْضٌ
also, signifies (assumed tropical:)  doubt: and (assumed tropical:)  hypocrisy: (K:)
and (assumed tropical:)  weakness of belief: (TA:) and the former,
(TA,) or ↓ both, (K,) (assumed tropical:)  languor, or languidness,
or weakness: (K:) and (assumed tropical:)  darkness (IAar, K)
in the heart: (IAar:) and (assumed tropical:)  defectiveness; deficiency; or imperfection; (IAar, K;) which
last is said by IAar to be the primary signification: (TA:) or مَرَضٌ in the body is a
languor, or languidness, or weakness, of the limbs,
or members: and in the eye, (assumed tropical:)  weakness of sight:
and in the heart, (assumed tropical:)  a flagging, or remissness, in
respect of the truth: (Ibn-'Arafeh:) or it properly signifies an accidental affection of the
body, which puts it out of the right state proper
to it, and necessarily occasions interruption, or
infirmity, in its actions: and tropically, (tropical:)  affections of the mind, which interrupt, or mar, its
integrity; such as (tropical:)  ignorance; and (tropical:)  evil belief;
and (tropical:)  envy; and (tropical:)  malevolence, or malice; and
(tropical:)  love of acts of disobedience; for these prevent
from the attaining of excellences, or lead to the
cessation of true eternal life: (Bd, ii. 9:) it is a
gen. n.: (IDrd:) and the n. un. is ↓ مَرْضَةٌ:
(A, TA:) it is one of the inf. ns. which have
pls., like شُغْلٌ and عَقْلٌ; the pls. of these three
being أَمْرَاضٌ and أَشْغَالٌ and عُقُولٌ. (Sb.) فِى
قُلْوبِهِمْ مَرَضٌ, in the Kur, [ii. 9, &c.,] means
(assumed tropical:)  In their hearts is doubt: (AO:) or (assumed tropical:)  doubt
and hypocrisy. (TA.) And الَّذِى فِى قَلْبِهِ مَرَضٌ,
in the same, [xxxiii. 32,] (assumed tropical:)  In whose heart is
darkness: or (assumed tropical:)  flagging, or remissness, in respect
of what is commanded and what is forbidden:
or (assumed tropical:)  love of adultery or fornication: (TA:)
or hypocrisy. (A.)

مَرِيضٌ [Diseased; disordered; distempered;
sick; or ill;] in the state termed مَرَضٌ (Msb, K)
denoting that change of the constitution or temperament which is described in the explanation
of the latter word above; (K;) as also ↓ مَرِضٌ
(K,) and ↓ مَارِضٌ, (IB, Msb, K,) the first [and
second] being from the verb of which the inf. n.
is مَرَضٌ, and the third from that of which the
inf. n. is مَرْضٌ, (Msb,) and ↓ مَمْرُوضٌ, and
↓ مُتَمَرِّضٌ: (TA:) or, applied to a body, it signifies deficient in strength: (IAar:) pl. مِرَاضٌ
(A, K, TA:) and مَرْضَى (IDrd, Msb, K) and
مَرَاضَى (IDrd, K) and مُرَضَآءُ; (TA;) or مِرَاضٌ
may be pl. of مَارِضٌ (TA) [or of مَرِضٌ]. Accord.
to Lh, you say, عُدْ فُلَانٌ فَإِنَّهُ مَرِيضٌ [Visit thou
such a one, for he is sick]: and لَا تَأْكُلْ هٰذَا
إِنْ أَكَلْتَهُ ↓ الطَّعَامَ فَإِنَّكَ مَارِضٌ meaning تَمْرَضُ
[i. e. Eat not thou this food, for thou wilt be sick
if thou eat it]. (TA.) [مَرِيضٌ has also several
tropical significations.] You say also, عَيْنٌ مَرِيضَةٌ

the following trad.: لَا يُورِدُ مُمْرِضٌ عَلَى مُصِحٍّ
[One having diseased camels shall not bring them
to water immediately after one whose camels are
in a healthy state]: the prohibition being not
because of the transition of disease by contagion;
but because sometimes disease may befall the
healthy beasts, and it may come into the mind
of the owner that that is from contagion. (TA.)
[See also مُصِحٌّ.]
مِمْرَاضٌ A man frequently diseased or sick.
(S, K.)
