[Didst thou not ask the remains of the dwelling,
when were their times?] AHát asked As respecting متّى in this hemistich, and he answered,
I know not. AHát thinks that it is for مَتَى:
or that it may be for مَتًّا, inf. n. of مَتَّ; and
that the meaning may be [Didst thou not ask the
remains of the dwelling,] whereof the times when
men were present there are (or were) long past,

does not know. (L.) MF remarks upon it,
