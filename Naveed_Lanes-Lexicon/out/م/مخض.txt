مَخَضَ اللَّبَنَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
مَخُضَ,
(S, A, Msb, K,) and
مَخِضَ, and
مَخَضَ, (S, Msb, K,)
inf. n. مَخْضٌ, (Msb,) He churned, or beat and

-b2-
[Hence,] مَخْضٌ relates also to many things.
(TA.) Thus, you say, (TA) مَخَضَ الشَّىْءَ, (K,
TA,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He shook, or
agitated, the thing vehemently. (K, TA.) It is
said in a trad., مُرَّ عَلَيْهِ بِجِنَازَةٍ تُمْخَضُ مَخْضًا;
(L;) or تُمْخَضُ مَخْضَ الزّقّ; (O;) (assumed tropical:)  [A bier
with a corpse was conveyed past him] being
shaken, or agitated, quickly; (L, TA;) or being
shaken, or agitated, vehemently [like as the milkskin is shaken, &c.] (O, TA.) You say also,
مَخَضَ الدَّلْوَ, (K,) or بِالدَّلْوِ, (Fr, S, O, L,) which
latter is the correct phrase, (TA,) or مَخَضَ المَآءَ
بِالدَّلْوِ (A,) and مَخَضَ البِئْرَ بِالدَّلْوِ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He
dashed the bucket in the water of the well, to fill
it: (Fr., S, O, L, K:) or he drew much water
with the bucket: (A:) and the last, he drew

-b3-  And [hence,] مَخَضَ رَأْيَهُ (A,
Msb) (tropical:)  He turned over, or revolved, his idea,
or opinion, [in his mind,] and considered what
would be its results, (Msb,) until the right
course appeared to him. (A, Msb.) ―

-b5-  And مَخَضَ said
of a camel, (tropical:)  He brayed (هَدَرَ) in his شِقْشِقَة
[i.e. faucial bag, or bursa faucium]. (K, TA.)
-A2-  مَخِضَتْ, (ISh, IAar S, Msb, K,) aor.
مَخَضَ;
(S, K;) or مَخَضَتْ; (so in a copy of the A
and in a copy of the Mgh) or both; (JK, K;)
aor. of the latter, as of the former,
مَخَضَ; (K;)
and مُخِضَتْ; (ISh, L, K;) but this last is
disallowed by IAar; (TA;) and the generality
of Keys and Temeem and Asad say مِخِضَتْ,
with kesr to the م, [for مَخِضَتْ,] and in like manner they do in the case of every [incipient] letter
before a guttural letter in words of the measures
فَعِلْتُ and فَعِيلٌ; (Nuseyr, TA;) inf. n. مَخَاضٌ
(ISh, S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and مِخَاضٌ (Msb,
K) and مَخَضٌ; (A;) said of a she-camel,
(ISh, S,) or of a woman, (IAar,) or absolutely,

a woman, and of a she-camel, and of other
beasts, (TA,) (tropical:)  She was taken with the pains of

near to bringing forth; (Msb;) as also ↓ مَخَّضَتْ,
inf. n. تَمْخِيضٌ; (K;) and ↓ تمخّضت; (ISh,

(ISh.) And مَخِضَتْ said of a woman, (tropical:)  Her
child moved about in her belly, previously to the
birth: (Ibráheem El-Harbee:) and in like manner, بِوَلَدِهَا ↓ تمخّضت, (S, * TA,) said of a she-camel, (tropical:)  her young one became agitated in her
belly at the time of bringing forth: (TA:) and

cloud, or clouds, and] the sky, or heaven, prepared, or became ready, to rain. (A, TA.)

'Amr Ibn-Hassán, one of the Benu-l-Hárith-Ibn-Hemmám-Ibn-Murrah, says, (Seer, S,) but the
saying is also ascribed to Sahm Ibn-Khálid Ibn-
'Abd-Allah Esh-Sheybánee, and to Khálid Ibn-
Hikk Esh-Sheybánee, (TA,)
المَنُونُ لَهُ بِيَوْمٍ ↓ تَمَخَّضَتِ
أَنَى وَلِكُلِّ حَامِلَةٍ تَمَامُ
meaning [Time, or fortune,] was pregnant with
a day for him, of which the time of birth had
come: [for for every one that is pregnant there is
a term of completion.] (S.)

مَخَّضَ see مَخِضَتْ.
4
امخض اللَّبَنُ The milk attained to the
proper time for [its being churned, or] having its
butter taken, or extracted. (S, A, Msb.) In
the O and K, it is made to signify the same as
امتخض: but it seems that Sgh has inadvertently
omitted, after it, the words حَانَ لَهُ أَنْ يُمْخَضَ,
and that the author of the K has copied him
without referring to other lexicons. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Also امخض, (K,) said of a man, (TA,) (tropical:)  He
had his she-camels taken with the pains of parturition; (K, TA;) and his she-camel, in like
manner. (TA.)
5
تمخّض It (milk) was, or became, agitated
in the مِمْخَضَة; (S, A, * TA;) as also ↓ امتخض.

-b2-  It (milk) had its
butter taken. (K.) ―
-b3-  (tropical:)  It (a child, or young
one,) moved about in the belly of its mother;
as also ↓ the latter verb. (S, TA.) ―
-b4-  See also
مَخِضَتْ and what follows it, to the end of the
paragraph.

إِمْتَخَضَ see 5, in two places: ―
-b2-  and see مَخِضَتْ.
10
استمخض اللَّبَنُ The milk was slow in
becoming thick and fit for churning, and its
butter would hardly, if at all, come forth: such
is the best of milk, because its butter is in it.
(A.) ―
-b2-  Also, The milk was slow in acquiring
flavour after it had been collected in the skin.
(TA.)
مَخْضٌ: see مَخِيضٌ.
مَخَاضٌ (assumed tropical:)  The pains of parturition; (S, Msb;)
as also ↓ مِخَاضٌ. (Msb.)
-A2-  Applied to she-camels, (tropical:)  Pregnant: (AZ, As, S, ISd, A, Msb,
K, &c.:) used in this sense as an epithet of
good omen, whence they augur that their young
ones will become agitated in their bellies at the
time of parturition: (ISd:) having their young
in their bellies: (M, TA:) or such as are called
عِشَار, that have been ten months pregnant:
(Th, K:) but ISd says, I have not found this
explanation of مخاض on any authority beside that
of Th: (TA:) [see also عُشَرَآءُ:] it has no proper
sing: (S:) a single one is termed خَلِفَةٌ, (AZ,
As, S, A, &c,) which is extr. (K, TA) with
respect to rule: (TA:) or مَخَاضٌ signifies, or
it signifies also, (accord. to different copies of
the K,) she-camels in the state in which they are
from the time when the stallion is sent among
them (ISd, K) until he brays (حَتَّى يَهْدِرَ), or,
accord. to another relation, until they are left
(حتّى تُغْدَرَ), i.e., (ISd,) until he ceases (حتّى
يَنْقَطِعَ, in the copies of the K, erroneously,
حتى تنقطع, TA) from covering: (ISd, K:)
a pl. (K) having no sing. (ISd, K.) ―
-b2-  Hence,
(S,) اِبْنُ مَخَاضٍ (tropical:)  A young male camel, which,
(As, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) having completed a year
(As, S, Mgh) from the day of its birth, (As,)
has entered upon the second year: (As, S, Mgh,
Msb, K:) because his mother, (S, IAth, Mgh,
K,) from whom he has been separated, (S,) has
become adjoined to the مَخَاض, (S, IAth, Mgh,
K,) or pregnant camels, (IAth, K,) whether
she have conceived or not; (S, IAth, * K; *)
for they used to make the stallion-camels to cover
the females a year after these had brought forth,
(IAth, K, *) in order that their young ones
might become strong, so that they conceived in
the second year: (IAth:) or because its mother
has been covered, and has conceived, and become
adjoined to the مَخَاض, i.e., to the pregnant
camels; and this appellation it bears until it has
completed the second year; but when it has
entered upon the third, it is called اِبْنُ لَبُونٍ:
(Msb:) or a young male camel when his mother
has conceived: (K:) or whose mother has become
pregnant: or when the she-camels among whom
is his mother have become pregnant, though she
have not become so: (IAth, K:) the female is
called بِنْتُ مَخَاضٍ; (IAth, Msb, K;) or اِبْنَةُ
مَخَاضٍ: (S:) the pl., (S, Msb, K,) of both the
male and female appellations, (Msb,) is بَنَاتُ
مَخَاضٍ, (S, Msb, K,) only; like بَنَاتُ لَبُونٍ and
بَنَاتُ آوَى. (S.) Sometimes one adds to it the
article ال, (Msb, K,) saying, اِبْنُ المَخَاضِ:
(Msb:) [for] ابن مخاض is indeterminate; and
when you desire to make it determinate, you
affix the article ال, as above; but this only
makes it determinate as a generic appellation. (S.)
مِخَاضٌ: see مَخَاضٌ.
مَخُوضٌ: see مَاخِضٌ, in two places.
مَخِيضٌ and ↓ مَمْخُوضٌ (S, Msb, K) and
↓ مَخْضٌ (TA, voce مَحْضٌ, q. v.) [Churned milk:]
or milk which has been churned (الَّذِى قَدْ مُخِضَ),
and of which the butter has been taken: (S:)
or milk of which the butter has been taken:
(K:) or milk of which the butter has been
extracted, or fetched out, by putting water in it,
and agitating it. (Msb.)
مَاخِضٌ, applied to a she-camel, (ISh, IAar,
S, K,) and to a woman, and a ewe or she-goat,
(IAar, Msb, K,) and any pregnant animal, (S,
A, * Msb,) (tropical:)  Taken with the pains of parturition,
(ISh, IAar, S, A, Msb,) being near to bringing
forth; (IAar, Msb, K;) as also ↓ مَخُوضٌ:
(ISh:) and, applied to a ewe or she-goat,
having conceived; as also ↓ the latter epithet;
(As, K;) pl. of the former, مُخَّضٌ (S, Msb, K)
and مَوَاخِضُ. (A, K.) ―
-b2-  The Arabs say, in
one of their imprecations, صَبَّ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ أُمَّ حُبَيْنٍ
مَاخِضًا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [May God pour upon thee]
the night. (Ibn-Buzurj.)
إِمْخَاضٌ Fresh milk (حَلِيب), (K,) or churned
milk (لَبَنٌ مَخِيضٌ), (Lth,) as long as it remains
in the مِمْخَضَة: (Lth, K:) or, as some say, milk
collected in the place of pasturage until it amounts
to the quantity of a camel-load: pl. أَمَا خِيضُ.
(Lth.) You say إِمْخَاضٌ مِنْ لَبَنٍ and إِحْلَابٌ
مِنْ لَبَنٍ: (Lth:) or the former is of ewes or she-
goats, or of cows; and the latter, of camels.
(TA, in art. حلب, q. v.) ―
-b2-  See also مِمْخَضٌ.
مِمْخَضٌ A skin; syn.; سِقَآءٌ; (K;) as also
↓ إِمْخَاضٌ, which is mentioned by Sb, and thus
explained by Seer: (TA:) or a skin (سقاء) in
which is مَخِيض [or churned milk, &c.]: (TA:)
or the receptacle in which the milk whereof the
butter has been taken is agitated: (Lth:) and
↓ مِمْخَضَةٌ [and app. the former also] the vessel,
(Mgh,) or receptacle, (Msb,) [generally a skin,]
in which milk is churned or beaten and agitated;
(Mgh, K; *) or in which the butter of the milk
is extracted, or fetched out by putting water in
it, and agitating it; (Msb;) [i.e. a churn;]
i. q. إِبْرِيجٌ. (S.)
مِمْخَضَةٌ: see what next precedes.
مِمْخَاضٌ (assumed tropical:)  A she-camel having a quick flow
of milk. (JK.)
مَمْخُوضٌ: see مَخِيضٌ.
مُسْتَمْخِضٌ Milk slow in becoming thick and fit
for churning: (K:) or that hardly, if at all,
becomes so; and when it has become so, is
churned; and this is the best of the milk of
ewes or goats, because its butter is destroyed
(استهلك) in it. (TA.) [But see 10.]
