سر1
سَرَّهُ, accord. to the TA, has two contr.
significations: for it is there stated that “ one
says سَرَرْتُهُ meaning كَتَمْتُهُ and سَرَرْتُهُ meaning
أَعْلَنْتُهُ: ” and it is added that “ it will occur again
soon: ” but it does not again occur in that work,
nor have I found it in any other lexicon: I
therefore think that it is a mistranscription, for
أَسْرَرْتُهُ, first pers. of أَسَرَّهُ, q. v.]
-A2-  سَرَّهُ, (S, O,
Msb, K, &c.,) aor.
سَرُ3َ, (MS,) inf. n. مَسَرَّةٌ (S, O,
K) and سُرُورٌ [which latter, from the explanations
of it which will be found below, seems to be
generally, if not only, as an inf. n., that of سُرَّ,]
and سُرٌّ [which is also syn. with سُرُورٌ in the senses
assigned to the latter below] and سُرَّى and تَسِرَّةٌ
[which last may be also an inf. n. of ↓ سرّرهُ expl.
by Freytag as syn. with سَرَّهُ in the sense here
following, but without an indication of any authority], (O, K,) He, or it, rejoiced him; gladdened him; or made him happy; syn. أَفْرَحَهُ:
(Msb, K:) [or made him to experience a pleasure, or delight, and dilatation of the heart, of
which there was no external sign: see سُرُورٌ,
below.] And سُرَّ, [inf. n. سُرُورٌ, (see above,)] He
rejoiced; was joyful, or glad; or was happy:
(S, * A, * K:) [or he experienced a pleasure, or
delight, and dilatation of the heart, of which
there was no external sign; accord. to an explanation of سُرُورٌ:] you say, سُرَّ بِهِ and ↓ اِسْتَسَرَّ [He
rejoiced, was joyful or glad, or was happy, by
reason of him, or it]. (A.) ―
-b2-  سَرَّهُ, (K,) aor. as
above, (TA,) also signifies He saluted him with
[the offering of what are termed] المَسَرَّة, i. e. the
extremities of sweet-smelling plants. (K.)
-A3-
Also سَرَّهُ, (S, M,) aor. as above, inf. n. سَرٌّ, (S,) or
سِرٌّ, (so in a copy of the M,) He cut his (a
child's) سِرَر, or سُرّ, i. e. navel-string. (S, M.) And
سُرَّ He (a child) had his navel-string cut. (K.)
―
-b2-  And سَرَّهُ, aor. as above, He pierced him, or
thrust him, [with a spear or the like,] in his
سُرَّة [or navel]: a poet says,
وَإِنْ أَدْبَرُوا فَهُمُ مَنْ يُسَبْ  نَسُرُّهُمُ إِنْ هُمُ أَقْبَلُوا
[We pierce them in the navel if they advance;
and if they retreat, they are those who are pierced
in the podex; يُسَبْ being for يُسَبُّ]. (S.)
-A4-
سَرَّ الزَّنْدَ, aor. as above, inf. n. سَرٌّ, He put a piece
of wood, (M, K,) or a little piece of wood, (S,)
in the interior of the زند [or piece of stick, or
wood, for producing fire], (M,) or in its extremity, (S, K,) inserting it in its interior, (S,) in
order that he might produce fire with it. (S, M,
K.) One says, سُرَّ زَنْدَكَ فَإِنَّهُ أَسَرُّ Fill up the interior of thy زند, that it may produce fire, (AHn,
M,) for it is [worn] hollow. (S, K.)
-A5-  سَرَّ, [sec.
pers. سَرِرْتَ,] aor. يَسَرُّ, (IAar, Sgh, L, K,) inf. n.
سَرَرٌ, remarked upon by MF as extr., [though it
is agreeable with a general rule,] said of a man,
(TA,) He had a complaint of the سُرَّة [or navel].
(IAar, Sgh, L, K.) ―
-b2-  Also, aor. and inf. n. as in
the next preceding case, said of a camel, He
had the pain, or disorder, termed سَرَرٌ [q. v.].
(IAar, M.)
2
سَرَّ3َ see 1, second sentence.
-A2-  سَرَّرْتُهُ in the
phrase سَرَّرْتُهُ سُرِّيَّةً I gave him, or caused him to
take, a concubine slave, doubly trans., is [said to
be] changed to سَرَّيْتُهُ for alleviation of the pronunciation. (Msb.)
-A3-  سرّرهُ, inf. n. تَسْرِيرٌ, said of
water, It reached his سُرَّة [or navel]. (K.)
3
سارّهُ, inf. n. مُسَارَّةٌ and سِرَارٌ, (S, M,) [He
spoke, or discoursed, secretly to him or with him;]
he acquainted him with a secret. (M.) You say,
سارّهُ فِى أُذُنِهِ He spoke secretly to him in his ear.
(S, * K, * TK.) And كَانَ يُحَدِّثُهُ كَأَخِى السِّرَارِ
occurs in a trad., meaning He (Mohammad) used
to talk to him ('Omar) in a low voice, like him
who is telling a secret. (TA.) ―
-b2-  بَيْعُ السِّرَارِ is
The selling in which one says, “I will put forth
my hand and thou shalt put forth thy hand, and
if I produce my signet-ring before thee, it is a
sale for such a price; and if thou produce thy
signet-ring before me, for such a price: ” if they
produce together, or do not both produce, they do
thus again. (Mgh.)
4
اسرّهُ, (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِسْرَارٌ;
(Msb;) [and accord. to the TA سَرَّهُ; but see the
first sentence of this art.;] He concealed it;
suppressed it; kept it secret; (S, M, A, Mgh,
Msb, K;) namely, a story, or the like: (A, Mgh,
Msb:) and, contr., he manifested it; revealed it;
published it; made it known. (S, M, Msb, K.)
Both of these significations have been assigned to
the verb in the phrase وَأَسَرُّوا النَّدَامَةَ, in the Kur
[x. 55 and xxxiv. 32]: (S:) some say, that the
meaning is They will manifest repentance: Th
says, they will conceal it from their chiefs: the
former [says ISd] is the more correct: (M:) the
former meaning is also given on the authority of
AO; but Sh says, I have not heard it on the
authority of any other; and Az says that the
lexicologists most strongly disapprove of the
saying of AO; and it is said that the meaning is,
they, the chiefs of the polytheists, will conceal
repentance from the lower class of their people,
whom they shall have caused to err; and in like
manner say Zj and the [other] expositors. (TA.)
In like manner also the two contr. significations
are assigned to the verb in the saying of Imra-el-
Keys, [in his Mo'allakah,] لَوْ يُسِرُّونَ مَقْتَلِى,
which As used to quote with ش, thus, لَوْ يُشِرُّونَ
مَقْتَلِى, meaning that they might publish, or
make known, my slaughter. (S.) You say also,
أَسَرَّ إِلَيْهِ حَدِيثًا He revealed unto him a story (S,
K) secretly. (TA.) An ex. occurs in the Kur
lxvi. 3. (TA.) And أَسْرَرْتُ إِلَيْهِ المَوَدَّةَ, and
بِالمَوَدَّةِ, I showed, or manifested, to him love, or
affection. (S.) It is said in the Kur [lx. 1],
تُسِرُّونَ إِلَيْهِمْ بِالْمَوَدَّةِ, meaning, Ye reveal to them
the news of the Prophet by reason of the love that
is between you and them; the objective complement of the verb being suppressed: or المودّة may
be an objective complement, the ب being a redundant corroborative, as in أَخَذَ الخِطَامَ and
أَخَذَ بِهِ: (Msb:) and this interpretation is correct; for إِسْرَارٌ to a person necessarily implies
revealing a secret to him and at the same time
concealing it from another. (B.) ―
-b2-  وَأَسَرُّوهُ بِضَاعَةً,
in the Kur xii. 19, signifies And they concealed,
or kept secret, his case, making him as an article
of merchandise: (Jel:) or they conjectured in
their minds that they should obtain, by selling
him, merchandise. (TA.) [See also an ex. voce
اِرْتَغَى, in art. رغو.] ―
-b3-  اسرّ الفَاتِحَةَ, and بِالفَاتِحَةِ,
He recited the Fátihah [or First Chapter of the
Kur-án] secretly, or inaudibly: (Msb:) or the
latter form of expression is a mistake. (Mgh.) ―
-b4-
أَسْرَرْتُهُ also signifies نَسَبْتُهُ إِلَى السِّرِّ [which may
mean either I attributed it to secrecy, or, like
many phrases of this kind, by inversion, I attributed to him secrecy, or mystery]. (Msb.)
5
تسرّر and
تسرّى, (M, K,) and ↓ استسرّ, (K,)
He took to himself a concubine-slave. (M, * K, *
TA.) And تَسَرَّرْتُ جَارِيَةً, and تَسَرَّيْتُهَا, (S,) and
↓ اِسْتَسَرَّيْتُهَا, (TA,) I took to myself a girl, or
young woman, as a concubine-slave. (S, * TA.)
تَسَرَّرْتُهَا is [said to be] thus changed to تَسَرَّيْتُهَا,
(T, S, Msb,) for alleviation of the pronunciation,
(Msb,) on account of the three ر s following one
another, (T,) being like تَظَنَّنْتُ and تَظَنَّيْتُ.
(T, * S.) Lth says that تسرّيت is a mistake; but
Az says that it is correct. (TA.) ↓ اِسْتَسَرَّنِى
occurs in a trad. as signifying He took me to
himself as a concubine-slave; but by rule one
should say تَسَرَّرَنِى, or تَسَرَّانِى: as to ↓ استسرّنى,
it [more properly] signifies “ He revealed to me
his secret. ” (TA.) ―
-b2-  تَسَرَّرَ فُلَانٌ بِنْتَ فُلَانٍ [as
though signifying Such a one took to himself the
daughter of such a one as a concubine-slave] is
said when a man of low birth takes as his wife a
woman or girl of high birth because of the
abundance of his property and the littleness of
hers. (M.)
6
تسارّوا They spoke, or discoursed, secretly
together; acquainted one another with secrets.
(S, K.) [See also 3.]
-A2-  تسارّإِلَى ذٰلِكَ (tropical:)  He experienced pleasure, or delight, at that: as, for
instance, at his scratching a part of his body, or
pressing, or kneading, it; and at a thing disliked
by another person. (A, TA.) [But I am in some
doubt as to the correctness of this, and incline to
think that it is a mistake for ↓ استسرّ.]
10
استسرّ He, or it, became concealed; or he,
or it, concealed himself or itself: (K:) it (a
thing, or an affair,) became hidden or concealed
or secret: (A, Msb:) it (the moon) became concealed (S, M, A, TA) by the light of the sun,
(TA,) [i. e. by its proximity to the sun,] for one
night, or for two nights. (AO, S.)
-A2-  استسرّهُ He
took extraordinary pains in concealing it, or
keeping it secret. (TA.) ―

mystery:] pl. of the former, أَسْرَارٌ; (S, M, A,
Mgh, Msb, K;) and of the latter, سَرَائِرُ. (S, A,
K.) It is said in a prov., مَا يَوْمُ حَلِيمَةَ بِسِرٍّ [The
day of Haleemeh is not a secret]: applied to
anything commonly known: alluding to Haleemeh the daughter of El-Hárith the son of Aboo-Shemir El-Ghassánee; for, when her father sent
an army to El-Mundhir the son of Má-es-Semà,
she took forth for the soldiers some perfume in a
vessel (مِرْكَن), and perfumed them with it. (S.)
[You say also, هُوَ مَوْضِعُ سِرِّى He is the depositary
of my secret, or secrets.] The words of the Kur
[lxxxvi. 9] ↓ يَوْمَ تُبْلَى السَّرَائِرُ signify In the day

سُرُورٌ, (S, M, A, Msb,) or ↓ سَرُورٌ, when used as
a simple subst., (IAar, Sgh, K,) but this is strange,
and, accord. to MF, unknown, whether as a simple
subst. or as an inf. n., (TA,) and ↓ سُرٌّ (M, Msb)
and ↓ سَرَّآءُ and ↓ تَسُرَّةٌ, (M,) Happiness, or joy,
or gladness; syn. فَرَحٌ; (M, K; *) contr. of حُزْنٌ:
(S:) or dilatation of the bosom with delight, or
pleasure, wherein is quiet or tranquillity or rest
of mind, of short or of long continuance; whereas
فَرَحٌ is dilatation of the bosom with delight, or
pleasure, of short continuance, transitory, or
fleeting, not lasting, as is the case in bodily and
worldly pleasures; but فَرَح is sometimes called
سُرُور, and vice versâ: (Er-Rághib, TA in art.
فرح:) or سُرُورٌ signifies pleasure, or delight, and
dilatation of the heart, of which there is no
external sign; distinguished from حُبُورٌ, which is
cheerfulness, i. e., pleasure, or delight, or dilatation of the heart, which has a visible effect in the
aspect. (TA.)

couch, or couch upon a frame: a throne:] a
thing upon which one lies; syn. مُضْطَجَعٌ: (M,
K:) or a thing upon which one sits: (TA:) pl.
[of pauc.] أَسِرَّةٌ and [of mult.] سُرُرٌ, (S, M, Msb,
K,) and some, for the latter, say سُرَرٌ, as more
easy of pronunciation, (S, Msb,) and make the
same change in other similar pls., (S,) and he
who says صِيْدٌ [for صُيُدٌ, pl. of صَيُودٌ,] says سُرٌّ
for سُرُرٌ. (Sb, M.) It is said to be derived from
سُرُورٌ, because it generally belongs to persons of
ease and affluence and of authority, and to kings.
(MF.) ―
-b2-  Hence, and as an appellation of good
omen, (Er-Rághib,) A bier, before the corpse is
carried upon it: (K:) when the corpse is carried

سَرَارَةٌ: see سِرٌّ, in the latter part of the paragraph, in three places. It signifies also (assumed tropical:)  The
best of the productive parts of a meadow. (TA.)
―
-b2-  And hence, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  Pureness, choiceness, or
excellence, of anything: (M, K:) pureness, and

the means, or circumstances, of life; syn. رَخَآءٌ;
[or a happy state or condition;] contr. of ضَرَّآءُ;
(S;) i. q. ↓ مَسَرَّةٌ and ↓ سَارُورَآءُ [contr. of مَضَرَّةٌ and

one takes as a possession and for concubitus; (M;)
a female slave to whom one assigns a house, or
chamber, in which he lodges her, (S, K,) and
whom he takes as a possession and for concubitus:
(TA:) of the measure فُعْلِيَّةٌ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb,)
from سِرٌّ as signifying “ concubitus,” (S, M, * Mgh,
Msb, K,) or as signifying “ concealment,” because
a man often conceals and protects her from his
wife; (S;) altered from the regular form of a
rel. n., (S, M, Msb, K,) by its having damm [in
the place of kesr]; (S, Msb;) for the rel. n. is
sometimes thus altered, as in the instances of
دُهْرِىٌّ from الدَّهْرُ and سُهْلِىٌّ from الأَرْضُ السَّهْلَةُ:
(S:) or it is with damm to distinguish it from
سِرِّيَّةٌ, which is applied to “ a free woman with
whom one has sexual intercourse secretly,” (Msb,)
or “ one who prostitutes herself: ” (TA:) or it is
from سُرٌّ in the sense of سُرُورٌ; because her owner
rejoices in her; (Akh, * S, * Msb;) and if so, it is
agreeable with analogy: (Msb:) so says A Heyth;
and this is the best that has been said respecting
it: (TA:) or it is of the measure فُعُّولَةٌ, from سَرْوٌ,
(M, Mgh,) the latter و being changed into ى
for euphony, and then the [other] و being incorporated into it and thus becoming ى like it, after
which the dammeh is changed into a kesreh because the ى is next to it: (M:) the pl. is سَرَارِىُّ
(ISk, S, TA) and سَرَارٍ; (ISk, TA;) the latter, by
poetic license. (Ham p. 304.)
