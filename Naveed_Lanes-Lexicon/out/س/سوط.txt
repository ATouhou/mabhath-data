(M.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] اِسْتَوَطَ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرُهُ (tropical:)  His affair,
or case, was, or became, confused, or disordered,
to him. (M, K, * TA.)
سَوْطٌ [A whip;] a certain thing, (S, M,)
namely, plaited skin, (Bd in lxxxix. 12,) [or a
lash,] with which one beats, or strikes, (S, M,)
well known; (Msb;) i. q. مِقْرَعَةٌ: (K:) so called
because it mixes the flesh with the blood (IDrd,
M, K) when a man or a beast is struck with it;
(IDrd, TA;) or because its several component
parts are mixed together: (Bd, ubi suprà:) pl.
[of pauc.] أَسْوَاطٌ and [of mult.] سِيَاطٌ: (S, M,
Msb, K:) the latter originally سِوَاطٌ. (TA.) The
saying ضَرَبْتُ زَيْدًا سَوْطًا means ضَرَبْتُ زَيْدًا بِسَوْطٍ
[I struck Zeyd with a whip]: (M, Msb: *) or it
is one of those rare instances in which a prefixed
n. is suppressed; being originally ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبَةَ سَوْطٍ
[I struck him a stroke, or lash, of a whip], meaning ضَرْبَةً بِسَوْطٍ [a stroke, or lash, with a whip]:
(M:) or ضَرْبَةً وَاحِدَةً بِسَوْطٍ [one stroke, or lash,
with a whip]. (Mgh.) One says also, ضَرَبَهُ مِائَةَ
سَوْطٍ [He struck him a hundred strokes, or lashes,
of the whip]. (S and K in art. سحل.) ―
-b2-  In the
Kur [lxxxix. 12], where it is said, فَصَبَّ عَلَيْهِمْ
رَبُّكَ سَوْطَ عَذَابٍ, (S, Msb,) it signifies (tropical:)  A portion,
or share: (S, K:) or (S, Msb, but in the K,
“ and ”) (tropical:)  vehemence, or severity; (S, Msb, K;)
as being likened to the paining of a whip; (Msb;)
because punishment is sometimes with the سَوْط;
(S;) and this word is used by the Arabs to denote
every kind of punishment when it is extreme,
though there be in it no beating: (Fr:) [therefore,] the above-cited saying in the Kur means,
(tropical:)  [And thy Lord poured upon them a portion,
or a share, or vehemence, or severity, of punishment: or it means,] a mixture; prepared for them,
of various punishments: or it is designed to show
that what befell them in the present world was,
in comparison with what is prepared for them in
the final state, like the whip in comparison with
the sword: (Bd:) or the meaning is (assumed tropical:)  a kind of
punishment. (Jel.) [Agreeably with this last explanation, it is said that] the phrase هُمَا يَتَعَاطَيَانِ
سَوْطًا وَاحِدًا means (tropical:)  They two are agreed upon
one mode: (A:) or the meaning is (tropical:)  [they two
enter, or plunge, into; or venture boldly upon,
and do;] one thing, or affair; (S, and K; but
wanting in one copy of the former; and in the
latter, in the place of هما is put ما;) i. e., one sort
[of thing or affair]. (S.) ―
-b3-  [قِيدُ سَوْطٍ The measure of a whip, i. e. a whip's length, is an astronomical measure, which seems, from several instances that I have noted, in the work of Kzw &c.,
to be the same as رُمْحٌ is in modern usage; i. e.
four degrees and a half, by rule; but, like the
latter, not precise nor uniform in every instance.]
―
-b4-  [The pl.] سِيَاطٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The seed-stalks
of leeks; (TK;) the stalks, of leeks, upon which are
the زَمَالِيق thereof: (M, K:) so called as being
likened to the سياط with which one strikes. (M.)
―
-b5-  And سَوْطٌ signifies also (tropical:)  A remaining portion
(A, K) of water, (A,) or of a pool of water left
by a torrent, (K, [in some copies of which الغَدِيل
is erroneously put for الغَدِير,]) extended like the
سَوْط [with which one strikes]: (A:) pl. سِيَاطٌ.
(TA.) ―
-b6-  And (assumed tropical:)  A place where water collects and
stagnates: (K:) pl. أَسْوَاطٌ. (TA.) ―
-b7-  And (tropical:)  A
road, or track, of little width, between two elevations: pl. أَسْيَاطٌ [or سِيَاطٌ?] and أًسْوَاطٌ: so in the
A: but some say شَوْطٌ, q. v. (TA.) ―
-b8-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A
kind of tent, of [goats'] hair. (Ibn-El-Kelbee,
TA voce بَيْتٌ, q. v.) ―
-b9-  And سَوْطُ بَاطِلٍ (tropical:)  Light
entering from an aperture in a wall, in sunshine;
(K, TA;) also termed خَيْطُ بَاطِلٍ: but as some
say, with ش. (TA: and it is mentioned with
ش in art. شوط in the S, and again in the K.)
سَوِيطٌ; fem. with ة: see مَسُوطٌ.
سَوَّاطٌ The شُرَطِىّ [or officer of the prefect of
police] who has with him the سَوْط [or whip]. (TA.)
مَسَوطٌ Mixed. (TA.) So in a trad. of 'Alee
with Fátimeh, [in which the former expresses the
intimacy of her union with him, as though they
two were one person,] مَسُوطٌ لَحْمُهَا بِدَمِى وَلَحْمِى
(assumed tropical:)  Her flesh is blended and mixed with my blood
and my flesh. (TA.) You say also, أَمْوَالُهُمْ
بَيْنَهُمْ ↓ سَوِيطَةٌ Their possessions are mixed among
them; (AZ, S, K;) i. q. ↓ مُسْتَوطَةٌ. (M.)
مِسْوَطٌ: see what next follows.
مِسْوَاطٌ A thing with which one mixes a thing,
(S, * M, K,) and stirs it about; (M;) i. e., a
stick, or the like, used for that purpose; as also
↓ مِسْوَطٌ. (K.)
-A2-  A horse that will not put forth
his power of running unless by means of the whip;
(Ibn-'Abbád and K; and so in a copy of the S,
on the authority of AO, but omitted in another
copy;) as though (TA) keeping it in store.
(S, TA.)
مُسْتَوِطٌ; fem. with ة: see مَسُوطٌ.
