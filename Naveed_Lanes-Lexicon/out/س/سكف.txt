سكف1
مَا سَكِفْتُ البَابَ, (Ibn-'Abbád, K, TA,) and
بَابَهُ, (TA in art, عتب,) aor.
سَكَفَ, (K,) I did not
tread, or have not trodden, upon the threshold
of the door, (Ibn-'Abbád, K, TA,) and of his
door; (TA;) as also ↓ ما تَسَكَّفْتُهُ: (K:) and
لَهُ بَابًا ↓ لَا أَتَسَكَّفُ [I will not tread upon the
threshold of a door of his; or] I will not enter a
house, or chamber, of his. (Z, TA.)

اسكف, (inf. n. إِسْكَافٌ, Msb,) He was, or
became, an إِسْكَاف [q. v. infrà]. (IAar, T, Msb, K.)

تَسَكَّفَ see 1, in two places.
سِكَافَةٌ The craft, or handicraft, of the إِسْكَاف
[q. v.]: (K:) termed by Lth an inf. n., the source
of الإِسْكَافُ, having no [unaugmented] verb. (TA.)
سَكَّافٌ: see إِسْكَافٌ.
سَاكِفٌ The lintel of a door, in which turns the
صَائِر, (O, K, TA,) this latter word meaning [the
upper and] the lower extremity of the door, the
upper of which turns [in a socket in the lintel,
and the lower in a socket in the threshold]: so
says En-Nadr. (O, TA. [The explanation of
صَائِرٌ in the O seems to have been mutilated by a
copyist, and requires the additions which I have
made, according to modern usage.])
سَيْكَفٌ: see إِسْكَافٌ.
أَسْكَفٌ: see إِسْكَافٌ, in two places.
أُسْكُفُّ العَيْنَيْنِ The parts on which grow the
eyelashes of the two eyes: (IAar, K:) or the
lower eyelids. (Z, K.)
أُسْكُفَّةٌ The threshold of a door, (S, O, K,) upon
which one treads; (O, K;) as also ↓ أُسْكُوفَةٌ:
(TA:) or the lintel of a door: and sometimes [or
rather almost universally] used in the former
sense, which is the only meaning mentioned in
the T [and] in the Abridgment of the 'Eyn [and
in most other lexicons]: pl, اسكاف [app. أَسْكَافٌ,
and, if so, anomalous]. (Msb.)
-A2-  Also The خرقة
[i. e. خِرْقَة, or rag, or ragged garment, or perhaps
it is a mistranscription for حِرْفَة, i. e. craft, or
handicraft, like سِكَافَةٌ,] of the إِسْكَاف: extr.: on
the authority of Fr. (TA.)
إِسْكَافٌ (Sh, S, M, Msb, K, &c.) and ↓ أُسْكُوفٌ
(Sh, S, M, K) and ↓ أَسْكَفٌ and ↓ سَكَّافٌ and ↓ سَيْكَفٌ
(K) A maker of boots, (Sh, Msb, K,) or of shoes
or sandals; (MA;) or a sewer of boots &c.:
(Msb;) or the first word, (Msb, K, TA,) as used
by the Arabs [of the desert], (Msb, TA,) any
artificer, or artisan, (Msb, K, TA,) thus expl.
in the M, and so its three [perhaps a mistake for
four] dial. vars., but said by J [in the S] to be a
meaning not known, (TA,) except the maker of
boots, for he is called ↓ أَسْكَفٌ, (K, TA,) i. e. when
they mean such as is called إِسْكَافٌ in the cities or
towns or villages: (TA:) or a carpenter; (K;)
in which sense it is used by Esh-Shemmákh, but
J says, [in the S,] only on the ground of supposition; (TA;) and any handicraftsman who works
with an iron tool: (AA, K, * TA:) pl. أَسَاكِفَةٌ
(S, Msb, TA) [and أَسَاكِيفُ]. ―
-b2-  Also the first
word, Skilful with an affair. (O, K.) Sh says,
I heard El-Fak'asee say, إِنَّكَ لإِسْكَافٌ بِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ,
meaning Verily thou art skilful with this affair.
(O.)
-A2-  Accord. to Ibn-'Abbád, الإِسْكَافُ is also
used (O, K) by Ibn-Mukbil (O) as meaning The
redness of wine: but this is a mistranscription,
(O, K,) and a perversion of the meaning: (O:)
the right word is الإِسْكَاب. (O, K.)
أَسْكُوفٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
أُسْكُوفَةٌ: see أُسْكُفَّةٌ.
