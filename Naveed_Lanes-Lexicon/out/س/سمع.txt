by itself]: (Ham p. 694, where occurs a usage of
its act. part. n. showing the verb to be trans. by

signifying only he gave ear, hearkened, or listened: but سَمِعَ, [as also ↓ تمسمّع and ↓ استسمع,]

or listened to, the thing] (S.) And الصَّوْتَ ↓ تسمّع

سَمِعْتُ لَهُ صَوْتًا I heard him, or it, utter, or produce, a sound; lit. I heard a sound attributable

whether employed as inf. ns. or as simple substs.,
see those words below.] ―

understood it; (TA;) he understood its meaning;
i. e., the meaning of a person's speech. (Msb.)
You say, لَمْ تَسْمَعْ مَا قُلْتُ لَكَ Thou didst not
understand what I said to thee. (TA.) And
such is the most obvious meaning of the verb in
the saying, إِنْ كَانَ يَسْمَعُ الخَطِيبَ [If he understand the words of the preacher]; for this is the
proper meaning in this case: but it may be rendered tropically, (tropical:)  if he hear the voice of the
preacher. (Msb.) ―

the saying, سَمِعَ اللّٰهُ قَوْلَكَ [God knew thy saying].

praise of him who praiseth Him: (Msb:) or may
God answer the prayer of him who praiseth Him.

زَيْدًا يَفْعَلُ كَذَا وَكَذَا means (assumed tropical:)  My eye saw Zeyd
doing such and such things: but Az says, I know
not whence Lth brought this; for it is not of the
way of the Arabs to say سمعت اذنى as meaning
my eye saw: it is in my judgment corrupt language, and I am not sure but that it may have
been originated by those addicted to innovations
and erroneous opinions. (TA.)

maketh men to hear of his deed,] God will make
the ears of his creatures to hear of him on the
day of resurrection; (TA;) or whoso maketh his
deed notorious, that men may see it and hear of
it, God will make notorious his hypocrisy, and
fill with it the ears of his creatures, and they
shall be generally acquainted with it, [and He
will render him contemptible, and small in estimation,] so that he will become disgraced; (Mgh;)
or the meaning may be, God will manifest to
men his internal state, and fill their ears with
the evilness of his secret intentions, in requital of
his deed: or, as some relate it, [for أَسَامِعَ خَلْقِهِ] we
should say, سَامِعُ خَلْقِهِ, which is an epithet applied
to God; so that the meaning is, Go [the Hearer
of his creatures] will disgrace him: (TA:) [for]

سَمْعٌ inf. n. of سَمِعَ, (S, Msb, K,) like ↓ سَمَاعٌ,
(S, K,) [&c.,] or the latter is a simple subst. [used
in the abstract sense of the former]. (Msb.) You

emphatic mode of expression, meaning I hear and
I obey, or for سَمِعْتُ سَمْعًا وَأَطَعْتُ طَاعَةً, which

being a quasi-inf. n. for إِطَاعَةً;] the verb [of each]
being understood: and سَمْعٌ وَطَاعَةٌ, meaning
أَمْرِى ذٰلِكَ [i. e. أَمْرِى سَمْعٌ وَطَاعَةٌ My affair is
hearing and obeying]. (K.) You say also, [in
like manner,] اَللّٰهُمَّ سَمْعًا لَا بَلْغًا, (K,) and سَمْعٌ لَا
بَلْغٌ: (TA:) see سِمْعٌ. And سَمْعُ أُذُنِى فُلَانًا يَقُولَ
ذٰلِكَ, (K,) [said to be] the only instance of the
kind among inf. ns. of trans. verbs except رَأْىُ
عَيْنِى, (TA in art. رأى,) [in a copy of the M, in
art. رأى, written سَمْعَ اذنى and رَأْىَ عينى,] and
اذنى ↓ سِمْعُ, and اذنى ↓ سَمْعَةُ, and اذنى ↓ سِمْعَةُ
[My ear heard (lit. my ear's hearing) such a one
say that]. (K) ―
-b2-  [As a simple subst., it signifies] The sense of the ear; (K;) [i. e., of hearing;] the faculty in the ear whereby it perceives
sounds. (TA.) Thus in the Kur [1. 36], أَوْ أَلْقَى
السَّمْعُ, (TA,) meaning, Or who hearkeneth. (Bd,
Jel.) [And hence,] أُمُّ السَّمْعِ The brain; (Z, O,
K;) as also ↓ أُمُّ السَّمِيعِ. (O, K.) One says,
ضَرَبَهُ عَلَى أُمِّ السَّمْعِ [He struck him upon the
brain]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [It is also used for the inf. n.
of أَسْمَعَ. Hence] one says, قَالُوا ذٰلِكَ سَمْعَ أُذُنِى,
and in like manner, اذنى ↓ سِمْعَ, and اذنى ↓ سَمَاعَ,
and اذنى ↓ سَمَاعَةَ, i. e. إِسْمَاعَهَا [They said that
making my ear to hear]: (K:) and one may say,
سَمْعًا [making to hear]: this latter one says when
he does not particularize himself. (Sb, K.) And
↓ كَلَّمَهُ سِمْعَهُمْ, with kesr, meaning, [He spoke
to him making them to hear, or] so that they
heard. (TA.) And a poet says,
اللّٰهِ وَالعُلَمَآءِ أَنِّى ↓ سَمَاعَ
أَعُوذُ بِخَيْرِ خَالِكَ يَاابْنَ عَمْرِو
[Making God and the learned men to hear that
I seek protection by the goodness of thy maternal
uncle, O son of 'Amr; or أَعُوذُ بِحَقْوِ خَالِكَ, i. e.
I have recourse for protection to thy maternal
uncle; thus in the TA in art. حقو;] using the subst.
in the place of the inf. n., as though he said إِسْمَاعًا
عَنِّى. (TA.) One says also, أَخَذْتُ ذٰلِكَ عَنْهُ سَمْعًا,
and in like manner, ↓ سَمَاعًا, [i. e. I received that
from him by being made to hear, which virtually
means, by hearsay, or hearing it from him,]
making the inf. n. [in each case] to be of a different form from that of the verb to which it
belongs [in respect of signification; i. e., using an
inf. n. of سَمِعَ for that of أَسْمَعَ]. (K, * TA.) [See
also سُمْعَةٌ.] ―
-b4-  It also signifies The ear; (S, *
Mgh, Msb, * K;) as also ↓ مِسْمَعٌ, (S, Msb, K,
TA,) because it is the instrument of hearing,
(TA,) and ↓ مَسْمَعٌ, [because it is the place thereof,]
(Aboo-Jebeleh, TA,) and ↓ سَامِعَةٌ; (S, K;) or
↓ مِسْمَعٌ signifies the ear-hole; (TA;) and so
↓ مَسْمَعٌ, and ↓ مُسْتَمَعٌ: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and
سَمْعٌ is also used as a pl., (S, K,) being originally
an inf. n.; but sometimes (S) it has for its pl.
أَسْمَاعٌ (S, Msb, K) and أَسْمُعٌ, (Mgh, O, K,) a
pl. of pauc., (TA,) [as is also the former,] and
أَسَامِعُ is a pl. pl., (S, Mgh, O, K,) i. e. pl. of
أَسْمَاعٌ, (S,) or of أَسْمُعٌ: (Mgh, O:) [for an ex.
of the pl. pl., see 2:] the pl. of ↓ مِسْمَعٌ is مَسَامِعُ;
(Msb, K;) or this may be an irreg. pl. of سَمْعٌ,
like as مَشَابِهُ is of شَبَهٌ. (Sgh, TA.) You say,
سَمْعُكَ إِلَىَّ i. e. [Incline thine ear to me; or] hear
thou from me. (S, K.) And طَرَقَ الكَلَامُ السَّمْعُ
[The speech struck the ear]. (Msb.) سَمْعٌ is used
as a pl. in the Kur [ii. 6], where it is said, خَتَمَ
اللّٰهُ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ وَعَلَى سَمِعْهِمْ [God hath set a
seal upon their hearts and upon their ears].
(S.) One also says, ↓ فُلَانٌ عَظِيمُ المِسْمَعَيْنِ Such
a one is great in the ears. (S.) The phrase
هُوَ بَيْنَ سَمْعِ الأَرْضِ وَبَصَرِهَا means (assumed tropical:)  It is not
known whither he has repaired: (AZ, K:) or
he is between the ears of the people of the land and
their eyes, [so that they neither hear him nor see
him,] the prefixed noun أَهْل being suppressed:
(AO, K, * TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  in a void land, wherein is
no one; (ISk, K;) i. e., none hears his speech,
nor does any see him, except [the wild animals
of] the desert land: (K:) or (tropical:)  between the length
and breadth of the land. (K, TA.) You say
also, أَلْقَى نَفْسَهُ بَيْنَ سَمْعِ الأَرْضِ وَبَصَرِهَا (assumed tropical:)  He exposed himself to perdition, or imperilled himself,
and cast himself no one knew where: (IAar,
Th:) or (assumed tropical:)  he cast himself where no voice of man
was heard, nor eye of man seen. (K, * TA.) ―

a simple subst. (Lh, K.) You say, اَللّٰهُمَّ سِمْعًا لَا
بِلْغًا, (S, K,) and لَا بَلْغًا ↓ سَمْعًا, (K,) and سِمْعٌ لَا
بِلْغٌ, and لَا بَلْغٌ ↓ سَمْعٌ, (TA,) a form of prayer,
(K,) meaning O God, may it be heard of but
not fulfilled: (S, K:) or may it be heard but not
come to: or may it be heard but not need to be
come to: or it is said by him who hears tidings
not pleasing to him: (K:) Ks says that it means
I hear of calamities but may they not come to
me. (TA.) You say also, سِمْعُ أُذُنِى فُلَانًا يَقُولُ
ذٰلِكَ: see سَمْعٌ. ―

part. n., meaning What has been heard, or heard
of:] a thing that one has heard of, and that has
become current, and talked of. (TA.) [Hence,

What has been received by hearsay; i. e. what is
established by received usage: as in the phrase,
مَقْصُورٌ عَلَى السَّمَاعِ restricted to what has been
received by hearsay; &c.: and in the phrase شَاذٌّ
فِى السَّمَاعِ deviating from the constant course of
speech with respect to what has been receeived by
hearsay; &c.; which virtually means deviating

“ what has been received by hearsay ” always

-b2-  It is also
syn. with مُسْمِعٌ [Making to hear; &c.]. (S, K.)
Az remarks its being wonderful that persons
should explain it as having this meaning in order
to avoid the assigning to God the attribute of
hearing, since that attribute is assigned to Him
in more than one place in the Kur-án, though his
hearing is not like the hearing of his creatures:
he, however, adds, I do not deny that, in the
language of the Arabs, سميع may be syn. with
سَامِعٌ or مُسْمِعٌ; but it is mostly syn. with سَامِعٌ,
like as عَلِيمٌ is with عَالِمٌ, and قَدِيرٌ with قَادِرٌ.
