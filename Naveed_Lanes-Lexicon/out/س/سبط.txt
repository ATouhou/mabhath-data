سَبْطٌ: see سَبِطٌ, throughout.
سِبْطٌ A grandchild; (S, Msb, K;) a son's child,
and a daughter's child: (M, TA:) pl. أَسْبَاطٌ; (S,
Msb, TA;) which is commonly used by the vulgar
as signifying daughters' children; distinguished by
them from أَحْفَادٌ [which they apply to son's children, pl. of حَفِيدٌ]; but the leading lexicologists
expressly declare that it includes sons' children
and daughters' children, as it is said to do by ISd:
IAar explained سِبْطٌ and سِبْطَانِ and أَسْبَاطٌ as
signifying the particularly distinguished, and
choicest, of children. (TA.) It is said in a trad.,
(TA,) الحَسَنُ وَالحُسَيْنُ سِبْطَا رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ El-Hasan,
and El-Hoseyn are the two grandsons of the
Apostle of God. (M, TA. *) ―
-b2-  A tribe of the
Jews: pl. أَسْبَاطٌ: (M, Msb, K:) سِبْطٌ (M) and
أَسْبَاطٌ (S, Msb) in relation to the Jews, (M, Msb,)
or [rather] the Children of Israel, (S,) being like
قَبِيلَةٌ (M) and قَبَائِلُ (S, Msb) in relation to the
Arabs: (S, M, Msb:) and the former are thus
called to distinguish them from the children of
Ishmael. (M, TA.) In the phrase, وَقَطَّعْنَاهُمُ اثْنَتَىْ
عَشْرَةَ أَسْبَاطًا [And we divided them into twelve
divisions, tribes], (S, M, K,) in the Kur [vii. 160],
(S, M,) اسباطا is a substitute (S, M, K) for اثنتى
عشرة, (S, M,) not a specificative, (S, M, K,) because the specificative may only be a sing.; (S,
M;) the meaning being وقطّعناهم اثنتى عشرة فِرْقَةً
اسباطًا, (Akh, Zj, S,) and therefore the numeral is
fem.; (Akh, S;) or this is a mistake; for it should
be فِرَقًا اثنتى عشرة; and therefore the numeral is
fem. (Abu-l-'Abbás, TA.) Accord. to Ktr, you
say, هٰذَا سِبْطٌ and هٰذِهِ سِبْطٌ, and هٰؤُلَآءِ سِبْطٌ and using
سبط as a pl., meaning فِرْقَةٌ. (TA.) The saying
كَأَنَّهُ سِبْطٌ مِنَ الأَسْبَاطِ
is [asserted to be] a mistake, inasmuch as its
author imagined that سِبْطٌ meant a man: (M:)
IDrd ascribes it to El-'Ajjáj or Ru-beh: it occurs
in an أُرْجُوزَة by the latter. (Sgh, TA.) [But it is
applied to a single man: for] it is said in a trad.,
(TA,) حُسَيْنٌ سِبْطٌ مِنَ الأَسْبَاطِ, i. e. Hoseyn is [as
though he were] a nation of the nations (أُمَّةٌ مِنَ
الأُمَمِ K) in goodness; so expl. by Aboo-Bekr:
(TA:) or one of the fathers of tribes; because of
the multitude of his descendants: or one of the
sons of daughters. (So in a marginal note in a copy
of the “ Jámi' es-Sagheer ” of Es-Suyootee.) ―
-b3-
Also A generation (قَرْن) that comes after another.
(Zj, TA.)
-A2-  And سِبْطٌ رِبْعِيَّةٌ, (TA in the present
art. and in art. ربع,) or رِبْعِيَّةٌ ↓ سَبَطٌ, (so accord.
to a copy of the M, in the present art.,) A palmtree of which the fruit ripens in the end of the
summer, or hot-season. (M, TA.)
سَبَطٌ: see the next paragraph, first sentence.
-A2-
Also Such as is fresh of the [plant called] حَلِىّ;
one of the plants of the sands; (M;) [i. e.] the
[plant called] نَصِىّ, while fresh; (A'Obeyd, S,
O, K;) when it has dried up, called حَلِىّ;
(A'Obeyd, S, O;) a plant like the ثِيل [q. v.],
except that it becomes tall; growing in the sands:
(Lth, TA:) n. un. with ة: (Lth, S:) it is one of
those that, when they dry up, become white, [as is
said of the حَلِىّ,] resembling hoariness, like the
ثُمَام [or panic grass]: (AHn, O: in the TA, the
نَمَّام:) it is asserted that the Arabs say, “The
صِلِّيَان is the bread of the camels, and the سَبَط is
their خَبِيص: ” (AHn, O:) its manner of growth
is like [that of] دُخْن [q. v.]; and it is a good
pasture: (K:) AHn says, a desert-Arab, of
'Anazeh, told me that its manner of growth is
like that of large دُخْن, falling short of [so I
render دُونَ, but this also signifies exceeding,] ذُرَة
[q. v.], and it has grain like the grain termed بَزْر
[q. v.], which will not come forth from its envelopes but by bruising, or pounding, and men
extract it and eat it, made into bread, and cooked:
(M, O:) the n. un. is with ة: and the pl. is أَسْبَاطٌ.
(M.) Also The tree that has many branches and
one أَصْل [meaning stem]: (K:) so says Az.;
adding that hence is derived أَسْبَاطٌ [pl. of سِبْطٌ];
as though the father represented the tree and the
children represented the branches: (TA: [but
this is questionable:]) accord. to Abo-Ziyád, a
certain tree, (AHn, M, O,) growing in the sands,
(AHn, O,) tall, having slender branches, eaten by
the camels and the sheep or goats, (AHn, M, O,)
and collected by men, who sell it upon the roads
(عَلَى الطُّرُقِ), (AHn, O,) or with the tamarisk
(مَعَ الطَّرْفَآءِ); (so in the TA;) without blossom
and without thorns, having thin leaves of the size
of [those of] the كُرَّاث [or leek] (AHn, M, O)
when this first comes forth. (AHn, O.) ―
