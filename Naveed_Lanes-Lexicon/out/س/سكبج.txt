سكبجQ. 1
سَكْبَجَ He prepared سِكْبَاج. (TA.)
سِكْبَاجٌ an arabicized word, (O, Msb, K,) with
kesr (Msb, K) to the س, not with fet-h, because
there is no word of the measure فَعْلَالٌ except of
the reduplicate class [like زَلْزَالٌ &c.], (Msb,) from
سِكْ, meaning “vinegar,” in Pers., and بَاج,
[arabicized from the Pers. بَاهَا,] i. e. لَوْنٌ [as
meaning “a sort,” or “species,” of food or
viands]; (O; [in which it is erroneously said
that بَاج is in Pers. بَاوَا;]) or from [the Pers.]
سِرْكَهْ پَاچَهْ; [سِرْكَهْ meaning “vinegar;” and
پَاچَهْ “sheeps' feet,” or “trotters;”] (TA;) [but
the former derivation is evidently the more probable;] A well-known kind of food; (Msb;)
flesh-meat cooked with vinegar: this is the best
that is said [in explanation of the word]: (TA:)
[in the present day, applied to a sort of food
composed of flesh-meat, wheat-flour, and vinegar;
and sometimes to other varieties of food, but
vinegar, I believe, enters into the composition of
them all: also called سِكْبَا; from the Pers. سِكْ
“vinegar,” and بَا “spoon-meat:” accord. to
Golius, on the authority of the Loghat NiametAllah Khaleel Soofee, a sort of food composed of flesh-meat cut in pieces, (to which are
afterwards added raisins, a few figs, and some
vetches,) with vinegar and honey, or acid syrop:
and سِكْبَاجُ البَقَرِ is a name given to such food
prepared with beef:] سِكْبَاجٌ أَصْفَرُ is a well-known
sort of broth [or soup] in which is saffron, wherefore it is termed اصفر. (Mgh.)
