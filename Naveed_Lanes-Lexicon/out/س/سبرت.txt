سبرتQ. 1
سَبْرَتَ He begged; and became lowly,
humble, or submissive; or affected to be like
the مَسَاكِين [or destitute, or needy, &c.]; syn.
قَنَعَ; (K, TA; [omitted in the CK, and in my
MS. copy of the K erroneously written قَنِعَ;])
and تَمَسْكَنَ. (TA.)
سُبْرُتٌ: see سُبْرُوتٌ.
سِبْرَاتٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.
سُبْرُوتٌ A desert, syn. قَفْرٌ, (S, K,) or a plain,
syn. قَاعٌ, (M,) in which is no herbage: (M, K:)
or weak land: (TA:) and أَرْضٌ سُبْرُوتٌ and
↓ سِبْرِيتٌ (As, Lh, M) and ↓ سِبْرَاتٌ (M) Land in
which is no herbage; (M;) or land in which is
nothing: (As, Lh, M:) pl. سَبَارِيتُ and سَبَارٍ, the
latter anomalous, mentioned by Lh: (M:)
accord. to A'Obeyd, the pl. سَبَارِيتُ signifies
deserts, or waterless deserts, (فَلَوَاتٌ,) in which is
nothing: and accord. to As, land [or lands] in
which nothing grows: (TA:) and one says also
أَرْضٌ سَبَارِيتُ, (M, K,) a phrase of the same class
as ثَوْبٌ أَخْلَاقٌ, (K,) as though the sing. سُبْرُوتٌ
or سِبْرِيتٌ were applied to every portion thereof.
(M.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) applied to a man, (AZ,
S, TA,) Needy, in want, indigent, (AZ, As, S,
M, K, TA,) poor, (AZ, As, K, TA,) possessing
little, (M, TA,) or, as some say, possessing
nothing; (S, * M, TA;) and ↓ سِبْرِيتٌ signifies
the same, (AZ, S, M, K,) as also ↓ سِبْرَاتٌ, and
↓ سُبْرُتٌ: (M, K:) also bankrupt, or insolvent;
syn. مُفْلِسٌ: (TA in explanation of the first [but
equally applying to all]:) the epithet applied to a
woman is سُبْرُوتَةٌ and ↓ سِبْرِيتَةٌ; (AZ, S;) the
latter of which is applied to a man [app. in
intensive sense, agreeably with analogy,] as well
as to a woman: (M:) and the pl. is سَبَارِيتُ,
applied to men and to women. (AZ, S.) ―
-b3-
[Hence, also,] applied to a youth, or young man,
Beardless; or having no hair upon the sides of
his face. (M, K, TA. [In the K, this signification is immediately followed by the mention of
the pls. سَبَارِيتُ and سَبَارٍ.]) ―
-b4-  And Little, or
small, in quantity or number; (S, M, K;) paltry,
or inconsiderable: (K:) applied to a thing, (S,
K,) and (S) to property, or cattle. (S, M.) ―
-b5-
Also Tall, or long. (M, TA.) ―
-b6-  And A skilful,
or an expert, guide, well acquainted with the
lands. (TA.) It is mentioned by Sb, who says
that it is of measure فُعْلُولٌ, like زُنْبُورٌ and
عُصْفُورٌ; and most hold him to be right: but some
of the authors on inflection assert that it is of the
measure فُعْلُوتٌ, from سَبَرْتُ الشَّىْءَ meaning “ I
tried, proved, or tested, the thing, or proved it by
experiment or experience; ” and that the ت is
added to give intensiveness to the signification;
which several deny: (MF, TA:) سُبْرُورٌ, however,
is mentioned in the K, in art. سبر, as meaning
“ poor,” and land “ in which is no herbage. ”
(TA.)
سِبْرِيتٌ and سِبْرِيتَةٌ: see the next preceding
paragraph, in three places.
سَنْبَرِيتٌ A man (TA) of evil disposition or
nature. (K, TA: but omitted in the CK.)
مُسَبْرَتٌ Bald, or bare of hair. (K, TA: but
omitted in the CK.)
