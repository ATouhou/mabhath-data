سنف1
سَنَفَ البَعِيرَ, aor.
سَنِفَ and
سَنُفَ, (S, M, K,) inf. n.
سَنْفٌ; (M, K;) and ↓ اسنقهُ; (S, * M, K;) or,
accord. to As, the latter only; (S;) He bound
the سِنَاف [q. v.] upon the camel: (S, M, K:)
and the latter, he put to him (i. e. the camel), or
made for him, a سِنَاف; (K, TA;) thus expl. by
El-'Ozeyzee. (TA.) [Hence, accord. to some,]
one says, in a prov., of a person confounded
or perplexed, and unable to see his right course,
in his affair, ↓ عَىَّ بِالإِسْنَافِ, (S, Meyd,) meaning
He was confounded, or perplexed, and unable to
see his right course, by reason of fright, like him
who knows not where to bind the سِنَاف: (Z, TA:)
it originated from the fact of a man's being thus
confounded, or perplexed: (Meyd:) a poet says,
(namely, Ibn-Kulthoom, TA,)
إِذَا مَا عَىَّ بِالإِسْنَافِ قَوْمٌ
مِنَ الأَمْرِ المُشَبَّهِ أَنْ يَكُونَا
[as though meaning When a people are unable to
find the right way to bind the سناف, in consequence of the affair that is uncertain to be:
(thus related by Meyd; but in the TA with حَىٌّ
in the place of قوم, and عَلَى in the place of من:)]
Az, however, says that this is not the meaning:
that الاسناف here signifies the advancing, or preceding; and that the meaning is, are unable to
find the right way of advancing, or preceding;
(Meyd, TA;) from أَسْنَفَ said of a horse, expl.
below. (TA.)
-A2-  See also the next paragraph.
4
اسنف, inf. n. إِسْنَافٌ: see above, in two
places. ―
-b2-  Hence, i. e. from this verb in the sense
expl. in the first sentence, (S, TA,) اسنف أَمْرَهُ
(tropical:)  He performed his affair skilfully, soundly, or
thoroughly. (S, M, K, TA.)
-A2-  Also He (a
horse) preceded the other horses: (S, TA:) and
اسنفت she (a camel) preceded the other camels
(K, TA) in going, or journeying, or pace; (TA;)
as also ↓ سَنَفَتْ. (K, TA.) [See the verse cited
in the preceding paragraph, and the explanation
of it by Az.] Said of a camel, it means also He
put forward his neck, to go on: (K, TA:) or he
advanced, or preceded. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Said of lightning, It appeared, or was seen, near; and so said
of the clouds (السَّحَاب). (K.) ―
-b3-  And اسنفت
الر ِّيحُ The wind blew violently, and raised the
dust. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
سَنْفٌ: see the next paragraph.
سِنْفٌ A leaf; (M, and so in copies of the K,
and in the TA;) or leaves: (so in other copies of
the K:) pl. سِنْفٌ; thus in the copies of the K,
[like the sing.,] but this requires consideration;
and it seems that it is سُنُوفٌ, a pl. assigned to
سِنْفٌ in a sense that will be mentioned in what
follows: (TA:) [or the pl. is سِنَفَةٌ, likewise mentioned, as a pl. of سِنْفٌ, in what follows, in three
places:] also (K) the leaf of the [tree called]
مَرْخ: (AA, S, O, K:) or the pericarp of the
مَرْخ: (S, M, O, K:) this, says IB, is the correct
meaning, as those acquainted with the مرخ
affirm; for, as 'Alee Ibn-Hamzeh says, the مرخ
has not leaves, nor thorns, but consists of slender
twigs; it grows in [water-courses such as are
termed] شُعَب: (TA:) a poet likens thereto the
ears of horses: (S:) the pl. is سِنَفَةٌ: (M:) or
the pericarps of any tree having a produce consisting of grains in a long pod, (AHn, O, K,)
that become scattered, when they dry, from that
pod, the shale thereof remaining; (AHn, O;)
one such pod is termed ↓ سِنْفَةٌ; (AHn, O, K;)
and the pl. [or coll. gen. n.] is سِنْفٌ; (K;) and
this last has for its pl. سِنَفَةٌ: (AHn, O, K:)
Aboo-Ziyád says that it is like [the pod of] the
بَاقِلَّى [or bean], except that it is wider, and
pointed at the extremity; wherefore a poet likens
thereto the ear of a horse: (O:) or, accord. to
AHn, ↓ سِنْفَةٌ signifies any pericarp, whether
oblong or not oblong; and the pl. [or coll. gen. n.]
is سِنْفٌ; and the pl. of سِنْفٌ is سِنَفَةٌ: (M:) [see
also حُبْلَةٌ:] and the shale of the [bean called]
بَاقِلَّآء, and of the [species of kidney-bean called]
لُوبِيَآء, and of the lentil, and the like; (IAar, TA;)
or the shale of the first of these three when what
was in it has been eaten; (K;) and the pl. is
سُنُوفٌ. (IAar, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, (K,) or ↓ سَنْفٌ,
with fet-h, (IAar, O, L,) A branch, or twig,
(عُودٌ,) stripped of its leaves. (IAar, O, L, K.) ―
-b3-
And the former, The [grain called] دَوْسَر [i. e.
زُؤَان, q. v.,] which is sometimes in wheat and
barley, (O, K,) and which vitiates them, and
lowers their prices. (O.)
-A2-  Also i. q. صِنْفٌ [A
sort, or species]. (K.) One says, هٰذَا طَعَامٌ سِنْفَانِ
[This is food, or wheat,] of two sorts, good and
bad. (AA, O.) ―
-b2-  And A company of men.
(Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.) One says, جَآءَنِى سِنْفٌ مِنَ
النَّاسِ A company of men came to me. (Ibn-
'Abbád, O.)
سِنْفَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two
places.
سُنْفَتَانِ and سَنْفَتَانِ Two pieces of wood set upright, between which is put the [pulley called]
مَحَالَة [by means whereof water is drawn.] (K.)
سِنَافٌ The [breast-girth called] لَبَب: (K:) or
the appertenance of the camel that is as the لَبَب
to the horse or similar beast: (Kh, S:) or a cord
which you tie to the تَصْدِير [or breast-girth of the
camel], then you bring it forward so as to put it
behind the callous protuberance upon the breast,
[and there, app., make it fast in some manner,]
and it keeps the تصدير in its place: (As, S, O,
K:) this is done only when the belly of the camel
has become lank, and his تصدير has [consequently] become unsteady: (S, O, K: *) or a
cord that is tied from the hind girth of the camel
to his breast-girth and is then tied to his neck,
when he has become lank: (M:) pl. [of mult.]
سُنُفٌ (M, K) and سُنْفٌ (K) and [of pauc.] أَسْنِفَةٌ:

other thing, that is put behind the [breast-girth
called] لَبَب, in order that it may not slip [from
its place]. (M.)

(AA, M, O, K) and سُنْفٌ: (K:) the cloths that
are similarly placed upon the hinder parts of
camels are called أَشِلَّةٌ [pl. of شَلِيلٌ]. (AA, O.)
―
-b2-  Also The حَاشِيَة [properly meaning selvage,
or selvedge,] of a carpet; (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K;)
i. e., its خَمْل [which generally means nap; but
this addition I think doubtful]. (Ibn-'Abbád, O.)
مُسْنَفَةٌ A she-camel having the سِنَاف [q. v.] tied
upon her. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  And خَيْلٌ مُسْنَفَاتٌ Horses
having the [withers, or parts called] مَنَاسِج high,
or elevated: denoting a quality approved in them;
for it is only in the best, and the generous,
thereof: and when they are thus, the saddles
recede upon their backs; wherefore the سِنَاف is
put to them, to keep the saddles in their places.
(M.)
مُسْنِفَةٌ A mare, (S, M, K,) and a she-camel,
(M,) preceding others in going, or journeying, or
pace; (S, M, K;) as also ↓ مِسْنَافٌ: (M:) and
مَسَانِيفٌ [being pl. of the latter] signifies the same;
and is applied to camels: (Th, TA:) or [so in
the K, but more properly “ and ”] مُسْنَفَةٌ, with

the belly. (AA, M.) ―
-b3-  And مُسْنِفَةٌ signifies also
Land affected with drought, barrenness, or dearth:
(El-'Ozeyzee, O, K:) or a year of drought, barrenness, or dearth: [thus expl. as a subst., or an epithet in which the quality of a subst. is predominant:] pl. مَسَانِفُ. (AHn, M.)
مِسْنَافٌ (tropical:)  A camel that makes the saddle to shift
backwards; (S, M, K, TA;) wherefore a سِنَاف
is put to him: (S, TA:) and, (K,) or as some
say, (S,) that makes it to shift forwards: (S, K,
TA:) so says Lth: but ISh disallows his explanation, saying that it means a she-camel that
makes the load to shift forwards; and that مِجْنَأَةٌ
[a word which I have not found anywhere except
in this instance] signifies the contrary: (TA:) or
that makes her fore girth to slip forward; contr.
of مُدْرِجٌ and مِدْرَاجٌ. (TA in art. درج.) ―
