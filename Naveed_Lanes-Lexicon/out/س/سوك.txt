but without the mention of its verb;]) and
↓ استاك and ↓ تسوَك, these two used without the

تَسَاوُكٌ and
سِوَاكٌ [each an inf. n., the verb of
the latter, if it have one, being app. ↓ سَاكَ,] A
weak manner of going: or a bad manner of
going, resulting from slowness or emaciation:
(K, TA:) so says ISk. (TA.) One says, جَآءَتِ
الإِبِلُ تَسَاوَكُ, [for تَتَسَاوَكُ,] i. e. The camels came
inclining from side to side, in consequence of
weakness, in their going along. (S, O.) [Or]
تساوكت الإِبِلُ means The camels had an agitation of their necks in consequence of leanness.
(IF, Msb.) In the M it is said that جَآءَت الغَنَمُ
مَاتَسَاوَكُ means The sheep, or goats, came, not

إِسْتَوَكَ see 2.
سِوَاكٌ and ↓ مِسْوَاكٌ signify the same; (S, Mgh,
O, Msb, K;) i. e. A tooth-stick; a piece of stick
with which the teeth are rubbed [and cleaned, the
end being made like a brush by beating or chewing it so as to separate the fibres]; (K, * TA;)
[commonly] a piece of stick of the [kind of tree
called] أَرَاك: (Msb:) accord. to IDrd, derived
from سُكْتُ الشَّىْءَ meaning “ I rubbed, or rubbed
well, the thing; ” (O, Msb;) accord. to IF, from
تساوكت الإِبِلُ [expl. above]: (Msb:) accord. to
Lth, (T, TA,) سِوَاكٌ is masc. and fem., (IDrd, T,
M, O, K,) though it is the more approvable way
to make it masc.; (O;) but Az holds this to be
a mistake, and the word to be masc. [only]; and
Hr says that this assertion of Lth is one of his
foul mistakes: (TA:) its pl. is سُوُكٌ (S, O, Msb,
K) and سُوْكٌ (Az, TA) and سُؤُكٌ, (AHn, TA,)
and [of pauc.] أَسْوِكَةٌ; and the pl. of ↓ مِسْوَاكٌ is
مَسَاوِيكُ. (TA.) In the saying, in a trad., خَيْرُ
خِلَالِ الصَّائِمِ السِّوَاكُ, a prefixed n. is [said to be]
suppressed [so that the meaning is The best of the
habits, or customs, of the faster is the use of the
tooth-stick: but see 2, where سِوَاكٌ is said, on the
authority of the Msb, to be also an inf. n.].
مِسْوَاكٌ: see سِوَاكٌ, in two places.
