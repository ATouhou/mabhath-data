lamp]. (M.) ―

سُدْفَةٌ and ↓ سَدْفَةٌ i. q. ↓ سَدَفٌ, (As, S, M, K,)
as meaning The darkness, (As, S, K,) in the dial.
of Nejd, (As, S,) or of Temeem; (K;) or as
meaning the darkness of night; or, as some say,
after the جِنْح [which here app. means the first
part of the night; or about the half; or a great,
or the greater, part]: (M:) and also as meaning
the light, (As, S, K, and M in explanation of the
first word,) in the dial. of others, (As, S,) or of
Keys: (K:) thus having two contr. significations; (S, K;) or the darkness and the light are
called by one and the same name because each of
them comes upon the other: (K:) or the first,
(S, M, K,) and second, (K,) the commingling of the
light and the darkness, (S, M, K,) as in the time
between the rising of the dawn, (S,) or as in the
time between the prayer of the dawn, (M,) and
that when the sun becomes white, (S, M,) accord.
to some, as is said by A 'Obeyd; (S;) or, as
'Omárah says, the first signifies darkness in which
is light, of the former part of the night and of
the latter part thereof, between the redness after
sunset and the darkness and between the dawn
and the prayer [of the dawn]; And Az says that
this is the correct explanation: (TA:) and the
first and second, a portion of the night: (M, K:)
or the first, a remaining portion of the night: (Ibn-
Habeeb, TA:) or the first of five divisions of the
night: (TA in art. خدر: see خُدْرَةٌ, voce خَدَرٌ:)
and the first, (K, TA,) i. e. with damm, (TA,)
or the second, (CK,) as also ↓ سَدَفٌ, the blackness of night: (K:) the pl. of the first is سُدَفٌ;
as in the saying of 'Alee, كَشَفْتُ عَنْهُمْ سُدَفَ اللَّيْلِ
I removed from over them the darknesses of night:
(TA:) and the pl. of ↓ سَدَفٌ is أَسْدَافٌ. (M,
TA.) You say also, رَأَيْتُ سُدْفَةَ شَخْصِهِ مِنْ بُعْدٍ

like شَدَفٌ,] The corporeal forms or figures or
substances of men or other things which one sees
from a distance: (K:) accord. to Sgh, (TA,)
correctly with ش: (K, TA:) but the truth is,
that they are two dial. vars. (TA.)

(TA.)
سِدَافَةٌ A veil, or covering; a thing that veils,
conceals, covers, or protects: whence the saying
of Umm-Selemeh to 'Áïsheh, (O, K, TA,) when
she desired to go forth to El-Basrah, (TA,)
قَدْ وَجَّهْتِ سِدَافَتَهُ i. e. هَتَكْتِ السِّتْرَ i. e. أَخَذْتِ وَجْهَهَا
[i. e. وَجْهَ سِدَافَتِهِ (JM in art. وجه) Thou hast
rent open his veil, or covering, meaning the Prophet's, as is shown in the TA]: (O, K, TA:) or
thou hast removed his veil, or covering: (O, TA:)
or thou hast removed his veil, or covering, from
its place, to which thou wast commanded to keep,
and hast placed it before thee: (O, K, TA:) but
the saying is also related otherwise, i. e. وَجَّهْتِ
سِجَافَتَهُ, mentioned before [in art. سجف]. (TA.)
One says also, وَجَّهَ فُلَانٌ سِدَافَتَهُ, meaning Such a
one quitted his veil, or covering, and came forth
from [behind] it. (TA.)
أَسْدَفُ, as an epithet applied to night, Dark,
(M, [as also مُسْدِفٌ,]) or black. (K.)
