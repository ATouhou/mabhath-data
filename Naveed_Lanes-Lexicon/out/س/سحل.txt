اللِّسَانُ الخَطِيبُ, (K, TA,) and MF defends this
as meaning The tongue that speaks well: (TA:)
[and it is said in the Ham p. 683 to signify
اللِّسَانُ الَّذِى لَا يَتَأَتَّى لِلْكَلَامِ, app. meaning the
tongue that does not prepare itself for speech;

شَكِيم of the bridle, (K, TA,) which is [generally
applied to the bit-mouth, but is here said by SM
to be] the piece of iron that is beneath the lower
