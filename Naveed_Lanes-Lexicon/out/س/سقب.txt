سقب1
سَقِبَ, aor.
سَقَبَ, inf. n. سَقَبٌ, He, or it, was,
or became, near. (Msb.) سَقَبٌ is syn. with قُرْبٌ.
(S, A, K.) You say, سَقِبَتْ دَارُهُ, (S, and so in the
K accord. to the TA,) with kesr [to the ق], (S,)
[inf. n. as above;] or سَقَبَت, (so in the CK and
in my MS. copy of the K and in my copy of the
Mgh,) inf. n. سَقْبٌ, (so in my copy of the Mgh,)
or سُقُوبٌ; (K;) [but I believe the verb to be
correctly سَقِبَت, like its syn. صَقِبَت, and the
inf. n. to be correctly سَقَبٌ, and perhaps سُقُوبٌ
also;] His house was near; (S, Mgh, K;) as also
↓ أَسْقَبَت. (S, K.) It is said in a trad., الجَارُ أَحَقُّ
بِسَقَبِهِ, meaning [The neighbour has a better, or
the best, claim to pre-emption] by reason of his
being near: (S, * A, Msb:) or the ب is a connective of احقّ with its complement, (Mgh,
Msb,) not to denote a cause, (Mgh,) and بِسَقَبِهِ
is expl. as meaning بِالضْلَرRُّفْعَةِ; (Mgh, Msb;) i. e.
the neighbour has a better, or the best, claim to
الضْلَرRُّفْعَة [or pre-emption], when his house is contiguous: (Mgh:) IAth says that it is adduced
as an evidence that الضْلَرRُّفْعَة belongs to the neighbour though not a sharer; i. e., that he has a
better claim thereto than one who is not a neighbour: but some explain الجار as meaning the
partner, or sharer: or the meaning of the trad.
may be, the neighbour has a better, or the best,
claim to kindness and assistance because of his
being near. (L, TA. [See also another reading
(بِصَقَبِهِ), and explanations thereof, in art. صقب.])
4
اسقبهُ He made him, or it, to be near: (K:)
or اسقب دَارَهُ he made his house to be near. (S.)
[And so with ص.]
-A2-  See also the paragraph
above.
-A3-  أَسْقَبَتْ is also said of a she-camel,
meaning She brought forth mostly males. (A, *
TA.) [And اسقب He got, or got mostly, male
offspring.] In the following saying, (S, TA,) of
Ru-beh, describing the two parents of a man
eulogized [by him], (TA,)
وَكَانَتِ العِرْسُ الَّّتِى تَنَخَّبَا
لِفَحْلٍ أَسْقَبَا ↓ غَرَّآءَ مِسْقَابًا
[And the wife whom he chose was generous, or
noble, or fair, one that brought forth, or brought
forth mostly, male offspring, to a male that
begot, or begot mostly, such offspring,] the last
word is a verb, in the pret. tense, not an epithet
applied to فحل. (S, * TA. [In the former, only
the second hemistich is cited.])
6
تساقبت أَبْيَاتُهُمْ was probably used as meaning Their tents, or houses, were near together:
see the part. n. of this verb below.]
سَقْبٌ The young one of a camel: or, when just
brought forth: (K:) or only the male young one
of a camel: (S, K:) [see also صَقْبٌ:] when a
she-camel has brought forth her young one, the
latter, when just born, is called سَلِيلٌ, before it is
known whether it is a male or a female; but
when it is known, if it is a male, it is called
سَقْبٌ: (As, TA:) the female is not called سَقْبَةٌ,
(S, K,) but حَائِلٌ: (S:) or it is [sometimes]
called by the former of these appellations: (K:)
[see De Sacy's Chrest. Arabe, 2nd ed., ii. 358:
and see سَقْبَةٌ below:] the pl. is أَسْقُبٌ [a pl. of
pauc.] and سِقَابٌ and سُقُوبٌ and سُقْبَانٌ. (K.)
أَذَلُّ مِنَ السُّقْبَانِ بَيْنَ الحَلَائِبِ

among the milch camels] is a prov. [from a verse

Applied to a branch, Juicy, thick, and long: (Az,
TA: [and so صَقْبٌ:]) or anything of the like kind
full and complete. (ADk, TA.) In the following verse, cited by Sb,
وَسَاقِيَيْنِ مِثْلَ زَيْدٍ وَجُعَلْ
سَقْبَانِ مَمْضْلَرRُوقَانِ مَكْنُوزَا العَضَلْ
سَقْبَانِ signifies طَوِيلَانِ [tall], and is also written
صَقْبَانِ: (Sh, TA:) [so that the meaning may be,
And two waterers, or givers of drink, like Zeyd and
Jo'al: they being two tall persons, light of flesh,
compact in the muscles: I suppose هُمَا to be
understood before the latter hemistich; because
of the ns. in the nom. case: and I have substituted مَكْنُوزَا for مَنْكُوزَا, the reading in the TA,
doubtless a mistranscription:] or it is for مِثْلَ
سَقْبَيْنِ [meaning like two male young ones of
camels]. (L, TA.) ―
