سعترسَعْتَرٌ A certain plant, (S, Msb, K,) of the kind
called بُقُول, (Mgh,) well known; (Msb, K;) and
applied also to the grain, or seed, thereof:
(Mgh:) [a species of origanum, or majoram: so
in the present day; and so says Golius, as on the
authority of Ibn-Beytár, “origani species, sc.
consonante voce, satureia, Hisp. axedrea: ” accord. to Forskål, (Flora Aeg. Arab. p. cxiv.,)
“ thymus serpyllum: ”] some write the word in
books of medicine with ص, in order that [when
written without the diacritical points] it may not
be confounded with شَعِيرٌ: (S, Mgh:) in the T,
it is with ص, on the authority of AA, only; and
thus in the book of Lth: in the Jámi' of ElGhooree, with س and ص: (Mgh:) or the س is
changed into ص in the dial. of Bel'ambar [or
Benu-l-'Ambar]; and some pronounced it only
with ص: (Msb:) accord. to Abu-l-'Alà, the
vulgar pronounce it with س, and the approved
word is with ص. (Ham p. 462.) [In the present
day, it is also written with ز.]
سَعْتَرِىٌّ i. q. شَاطِرٌ [q. v.], (K,) in the dial. of
the people of El-'Irák. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And Generous,
noble, or high-born, and courageous, brave, or
strong-hearted. (K.) The pronunciation with ص
is of higher authority. (K. [This remark is probably there meant to relate to both of the words
of this art.])
