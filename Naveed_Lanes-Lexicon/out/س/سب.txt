[And I witness many persons of 'Owf, alighting
during their journeys, going repeatedly to and
fro to see Ez-Zibrikán's turban dyed with
saffron]: (S, M, Mgh:) for it was a custom of
the chiefs of the Arabs to dye their turbans with
saffron: or, as some say, the meaning is his
اِسْت; [but this is correctly, or more commonly,
termed سَبَّة;] and Ktr asserts that he was suspected: (M:) he says that Ez-Zibrikán used to
tinge his است yellow; but this is a strange saying.

manner as it is substituted in the case of إِجَّاصٌ

former is the correct meaning: (M:) the pl. of
both words is أَسْبَابٌ, (M, TA, *) [and] the pl. of
the latter word is سُبُوبٌ (S, TA) also: (TA:) or
سَبَبٌ signifies any rope let down, or made to
descend, from above: (AO, TA:) or a strong and
long rope, but no rope is so called except one by
means of which one ascends and descends: (Khálid

given to a rope of which one end is attached to
a roof or ceiling or the like: (TA:) or one by
means of which one ascends palm-trees: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [and] a rope by means of which one

he reach the highest part thereof. (Bd.) The
saying

rope or cord, may be meant; or a string, or
thread. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (Msb,) (tropical:)  A thing
(S, M, Msb, K) of any kind (S, Msb, K) by
means of which one attains, reaches, or gains

to, water. ” (TA.) One says, اِنْقَطَعَ بَيْنَهُمُ السَّبَبُ
i. e. (tropical:)  The connexion, or tie, [of affinity between
