سلسبلسَلْسَبِيلٌ, a quinqueliteral-radical word, (M,)
Easy [as a beverage] in the utmost degree:
(TA:) [applied as an epithet to milk, (لَبَن, so in
a copy of the M, and so in the CK,) or signifying
smooth, (لَيِّن, so in copies of the K,)] in which is
no roughness: (M, K:) and sometimes applied as
an epithet to water, (M, TA,) or beverage, meaning easy of entrance into the throat, or fauces.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And Wine: (K:) so accord. to some,
as in the saying of 'Abd-Allah Ibn-Rawáhah,
in which it is [said to be] used as a syn. adjunct
to the preceding word:
إِنَّهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ فِى جِنَان ٍ
يَشْرَبُونَ الرَّحِيقَ وَالسَّلْسَبِيلَا
[as though meaning Verily they are with their
Lord, in gardens, drinking wine and fermented
juice of the grape: but the meaning may be, the
choicest of wine, or the sweetest thereof, &c., (see
رَحِيقٌ,) and wine easy to swallow, or the like].
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And A certain fountain in Paradise
[mentioned in art. سبل, q. v.]: (M, K:) Aboo-Bekr says that it may be a proper name of the
fountain, and properly imperfectly decl. [i. e.
without tenween] as being determinate and of the
fem. gender, but made to be with tenween at the
end of a verse in the Kur [lxxvi. 18] in order
that it may be conformable with other endings of
verses; or it may be an epithet applied to the
fountain, and therefore perfectly decl.: (TA:) Sb
mentions it as an ex. of an epithet: IAar says
that he had not heard it except in the Kur-án:
(M, TA:) I'Ab says that سَلْسَبِيلًا [in the Kur]
means that slips, or steals, (يَنْسَلُّ,) into the throats,
or fauces: [as though the radical letters were
only س and ل, which some assert to be the case:]
accord. to Aboo-Jaafar El-Bákir, it means soft in
the part between the حَنْجَرَة [or head of the windpipe] and the حَلْق [or fauces]: the explanation
as meaning [سَلْ سَبِيلًا i. e.] سَلْ رَبَّكَ سَبِيلًا إِلَى هٰذِهِ
العَيْنِ [Ask of thy Lord a way of access to this
fountain] is a mistake, not allowable. (TA.) ―
-b4-
The pl. is سَلَاسِبُ and سَلَاسِيبُ: and the pl. of
[the fem.] سَلْسَبِيلَةٌ is سَلْسَبِيلَاتٌ. (TA.) ―
-b5-  [In
the present day it is applied to An artificial
fountain that throws up water.]
