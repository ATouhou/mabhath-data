سُلْطَةٌ: see سُلْطَانٌ; for the latter, in three

سَلْطَنَةٌ: see سُلْطَانٌ; for the latter, in three
places.
سُلْطَانٌ Strength, might, force, or power; (TA;)
as also ↓ سَلْطَنَةٌ: (Bd in iii. 144:) predominance;
the possession, or exercise, of superior power or
force, or of dominion, or authority, and power,
or of absolute dominion or authority and power;
(Mgh;) as also ↓ سُلْطَةٌ; (S;) the former being
syn. with تَسَلُّطٌ [used as a subst.]; (Mgh;) and
the latter being the subst. from تَسَلَّطَ: (S:)
power of dominion; sovereign, or ruling, power;
(M;) [in this sense, as well as in the first,] i. q.
↓ سَلْطَنَةٌ; (Msb;) power of a king; (Lth, Mgh,
K;) and of a governor; (Mgh, Msb;) [i. e.]
delegated power, or power given to one who is not
a king; (TA;) also written سُلْطَانٌ; (M, Msb,
K;) which is the only instance of this form:
(Msb:) it is masc. and fem.; (M, TA;) generally
masc., in the opinion of the skilful; but sometimes
fem.; so say IAmb and Zj and others: (Msb:)
but ISk says that it is fem. (TA.) One says,
(ISk,) or some say, (Msb,) قَضَتْ بِهِ السُّلْطَانُ
(ISk, Msb) The sovereign, or ruling, power
(↓ السَّلْطَنَةُ) decreed it. (Msb.) And Aboo-Zuheyr
says, I heard one, in whose chasteness of speech
I have confidence, say, أَتَتْنَا سُلْطَانٌ جَائِرَةٌ [A
tyrannical sovereign, or ruling, power, came to
us]. (Msb.) It is said in a trad., إِلَّا أَنْ تَسْأَلَ
ذَا سُلْطَان ٍ, meaning Unless thou ask the ruler, or
governor, or the king, for thy due from the public
treasury. (Mgh.) And you say, قَدْ جَعَلْتُ لَكَ
سُلْطَانًا عَلَى أَخْذِ حَقِّى مِنْ فُلَان ٍ I have given
thee power, or authority, to take, or receive, my due
from such a one. (TA.) And لَا يَؤُمُّ الرَّجُلُ الرَّجُلَ
فِى سُلْطَانِهِ [A man shall not take precedence of a
man in his authority]; meaning, in his house,
and where he has predominance, or superior
power, or authority; nor shall he sit upon his
cushion; for in doing so he would show him
contempt. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  Strength, or hardness, of
anything: (M, K:) sharpness of anything: force,
or violence, of anything. (TA.) The vehemence
of winter. (TK.) An excited and predominant
state of the blood; or inflammation thereof.
(IDrd, M, K.) The flaming, or blazing, of fire.
(IDrd.) ―
-b3-  A proof; an evidence; an argument;
a plea; an allegation; syn. حُجَّةٌ, (S, M, Mgh,
Msb, K,) and بُرْهَانٌ: (S, Msb:) a حُجَّة being
thus called because of the force with which truth
attacks the mind: (B:) or, accord. to Mohammad
Ibn-Yezeed, from سَلِيطٌ, (M, TA,) signifying
“ oil of olives,” because it enlightens: (TA:) and
in these senses it has no pl., because it is used in
the place of an inf. n. (S, TA.) Accord. to I'Ab,
it signifies حُجَّة wherever it occurs in the Kur.
(TA.) But in the words of the Kur [xvii. 35],
فَقَدْ جَعَلْنَا لِوَلِّيِهِ سُلْطَانًا, the meaning may be
either [We have given to his executor, or heir,]
authority, and power, or absolute authority and
power, or the like; or a plea, or the like. (Mgh.)
And again, in the Kur [lxix. 29], هَلَكَ عَنِّى
سُلْطَانِيَهْ, the meaning may be My dominion, and
my authority and power over men, has perished
from me; or my plea. (Bd, B.) And sometimes
it means A miracle; as in the words of the Kur
[li. 38], إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَاهُ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ بِسُلْطَان ٍ مُبِين ٍ [When
we sent him to Pharaoh with a manifest miracle].
(TA.) Az says that it is sometimes masc. because it has a masc. form; and thus it is in the
last of the instances above. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Also A
ruler, or governor, or the like; a king; a sovereign; (S, K, TA;) a khaleefeh: (TA:) these are
its most common applications [in the writings of
post-classical times]: (TA:) thus applied because
the person so called is made to predominate; to
have, or exercise, superior power or force; to
have dominion, or the like: or because he is one
of the evidences of God: (Aboo-Bekr, TA:) or
because he possesses proof or evidence [of his
right]: or because by him pleas and rights are
established: (TA:) or because he enlightens the
earth, (Msb, * B,) and is of great usefulness;
(B;) the word being derived from سَلِيطٌ [signifying “ olive-oil ”]: (Msb:) it is of the measure
فُعْلَانٌ: (S:) and when [thus] applied to a person,
it is masc.: (Msb:) or it is masc. and fem.: (S,
TA:) accord. to Mohammad Ibn-Yezeed, (TA,)
fem. because it is [originally] pl. of سَلِيطٌ applied
to “ oil; ” as though the kingdom shone by him;
or because it has the signification of حُجَّةٌ: and
sometimes masc., because regarded as meaning a
man; (K, TA;) or because regarded as a sing.:
so says Mohammad Ibn-Yezeed; but Az observes
that none beside him says this: Fr says that he
who makes it masc. regards it as meaning رَجُلٌ;
and he who makes it fem. regards it as meaning
حُجَّةٌ: (TA:) the pl. is سَلَاطِينُ. (S, Msb.) It
is also, itself, sometimes used as a pl.; as in the
phrase سَيِّدُ السُّلْطَانِ, used by a poet, meaning
سَيِّدُ السَّلَاطِينَ [The lord of kings]; i. e. the
khaleefeh: [but this may be rendered the lord of
sovereign power, &c.:] or, as some say, the latter
word is here pl. of سَلِيطٌ, like as رُغْفَانٌ is pl. of
رَغِيفٌ. (Msb.)
سَلَطَانَةٌ, and سِلِطَانَةٌ, or سِلِطَّانَةٌ: see سَلِيطٌ.
سَلِيطٌ Strong, or hard; (M, K;) as also ↓ سَلِطٌ,
(M,) or ↓ سَلْطٌ. (K.) You say, ↓ حَافِرٌ سَلِطٌ,
(M,) or ↓ سَلْطٌ, (TA,) and سَلِيطٌ, (M, TA,) A
strong, or hard, solid hoof. (M, TA.) And
الحَافِرِ ↓ دَابَّةٌ سَلِطَةُ A beast having a strong, or
hard, hoof. (M.) And الخُفِّ ↓ بَعِيرٌ سَلِطُ A
camel having a strong, or hard, foot. (M.) ―
-b2-
Sharp; applied to anything. (K.) You say also
↓ سَنَابِكُ سَلِطَاتٌ Sharp edges of the fore parts of
hoofs. (S, TA.) ―
-b3-  Chaste in speech, or eloquent,
(S, K,) and sharp in tongue: (S:) an epithet
of praise when applied to the male, and of dispraise when [with ة] applied to the female:
(IDrd, K:) also, (K,) long-tongued; (M, K;)
and so ↓ سَلِطٌ, (M,) or ↓ سَلْطٌ; (K;) fem. سَلِيطَةٌ,
and ↓ سَلَطَانَةٌ, (M, K,) and ↓ سِلِطَانَةٌ, (K,) or
↓ سِلِطَّانَةٌ; (M;) the last written [thus] with tesh-deed to the ط in the Jm., and there explained as
signifying long-tongued and clamorous: (TA:)
or سَلِيطٌ signifies clamorous and foul-tongued;
and so سَلِيطَةٌ applied to a woman: (Msb:) or
the latter, applied to a woman, clamorous: (S:)
or long-tongued and vehemently clamorous:
(Lth:) or سَلِيطَةُ اللِّسَانِ is applied to a woman
in two senses; signifying sharp-tongued; and
long-tongued. (Az, TA.) You say also, لِسَانٌ
سَلِيطٌ, (M, K,) and ↓ سَلِطٌ, (M,) or ↓ سَلْطٌ, (K,)
A long tongue. (M, K.)
-A2-  Oil of olives; (S, M,
Msb, K;) so applied by the generality of the
Arabs: but by the people of El-Yemen applied
to oil of sesame, or sesamum: (S, M:) IDrd, in
the Jm, says the reverse; and IF has followed
him; but what J says is right, as Sgh, has observed in the O: (TA:) also, (K,) or as some
say, (M,) any oil expressed from grains or
berries: (M, K:) pl. سُلْطَانٌ. (Msb, K.)
أَسْلَطُ More, and most, overcoming, prevailing,
predominating, or superior in power or force.
(Har p. 661.) ―
-b2-  هُوَ أَسْلَطُهُمْ لِسَانًا He is the most
chaste, or eloquent, and the sharpest, [&c., (see
an ex. voce سِلْقٌ,)] of them in tongue. (S.)
